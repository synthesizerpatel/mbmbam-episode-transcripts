WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:46.800 --> 00:58.880
Aren't we a pair? Me here at last on the ground, you in midair. Sending the clowns. Isn't it bliss?

00:59.680 --> 01:09.440
Don't you approve? One who keeps tearing around, one who can't move. Where are the clowns?

01:09.440 --> 01:21.440
Sending the clowns. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me 100,

01:21.440 --> 01:28.720
a retrospective. I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I am your middle-est brother,

01:28.720 --> 01:33.280
Travis McElroy. I'm the sweet baby brother Griffin. Why are we talking like this?

01:33.280 --> 01:38.720
It's like an NPR special. Like an NPR special remembering the McElroy brothers. Behind the

01:38.720 --> 01:42.880
wisdom. Behind the wisdom, they called it. I think that idea is Terry Gross.

01:46.720 --> 01:52.960
Oh, Terry Gross humor. So welcome everybody. We're walking on broken Ira glass. Those are

01:52.960 --> 02:01.200
the only two people I know from NPR. Also, Rick Steves. So what do you know? This show stinks.

02:01.920 --> 02:06.480
That's my what do you know gag about what do you know with Michael Feldman. People have listened

02:06.480 --> 02:11.600
to a hundred episodes of this. That's their bad. This is what we're delivering. These are the

02:11.600 --> 02:17.600
goose we bring to our hundredth episode. This is our hundredth episode. The show of a hundred

02:17.600 --> 02:20.800
goose is what this is going to be called. This is not a lot of people know this, but the hundredth

02:20.800 --> 02:27.120
anniversary is the bad NPR puns anniversary. It's the most treasured gift. So this is our hundredth

02:27.120 --> 02:33.280
show. If you can believe that shit, we started. God, we, we, uh, our first episode I believe was

02:33.280 --> 02:39.440
April 11th or April 12th. Yeah. This is also our two year. I believe it's our two year anniversary.

02:39.440 --> 02:43.360
It is. Yeah. So we've been doing this junk for two years. You've been listening to me to skip

02:43.360 --> 02:48.960
12 episodes at some point or bad. Well, no, there's a, I don't think we numbered the candle

02:48.960 --> 02:55.280
nights episodes. Did we? Uh, and good job on the math there, Griffin. There's 52 weeks. So we'd be

02:55.280 --> 03:04.480
at a hundred and four. That's 72 times two. Hold on. Hold on. Six is a hundred. You forgot to carry

03:04.480 --> 03:09.280
it. Did you carry it? Did you do, where's the square root? I dropped the one. Yeah. You never

03:09.280 --> 03:16.880
show your work, Travis. Uh, so this is our advice show for the modern era. Uh, we have, thank you

03:16.880 --> 03:22.960
guys so much for letting us continue to do this for you for so long. Um, thank you for not finding

03:22.960 --> 03:28.800
anything better to do. Thank you for not getting one more extra productive hour in your week.

03:28.800 --> 03:33.600
Although I'm sure you're like cleaning. Are you cleaning the sink right now? You probably are.

03:33.600 --> 03:38.720
Somebody's doing dishes right now. You're doing dishes right now. Hey, if, if there's a couple

03:39.280 --> 03:42.640
doing dishes together while you're watching the show, I want you to look each other and just be

03:42.640 --> 03:47.840
like, it looks like we made it. Cause this is the mo these are the moments. This is like the

03:47.840 --> 03:53.600
equivalent of when you're painting the house together and she's got a handkerchief on her head

03:53.600 --> 03:57.120
and then one of you accidentally gets paint on the other and then oops, roller fight.

03:57.120 --> 04:01.600
This is like that kind of man. Also walking on sunshine is playing. It's like the first,

04:01.600 --> 04:06.720
it's like the first four minutes of up and then hopefully not the two minutes that follow that.

04:07.680 --> 04:13.440
You know, I would like someone who hasn't seen up before to show them up and then like hit stop

04:13.440 --> 04:17.040
after the first four minutes. Like that was it. It was just one of those Pixar shorts. Pretty great,

04:17.040 --> 04:23.040
huh? It's yeah. It's just called happy marriage. This is like the middle five minutes of the,

04:25.120 --> 04:31.360
fuck yeah. Curious jam a button, man. What's that? That old rat pit jam, you know, where they were,

04:31.360 --> 04:37.040
he was old and she was young. Jack. You're thinking of Jack. I'm thinking of Jack.

04:39.120 --> 04:45.040
So let's, let's actually get to helping people. We've got probably too much to do this week.

04:45.040 --> 04:50.800
So let's, uh, let's get right on it. My roommate's girlfriend has taken to spending four or five days

04:50.800 --> 04:55.120
of the week at our apartment. She takes a shower twice a day, uses the toilet, does most of her

04:55.120 --> 05:00.160
laundry here and uses the internet and cable. Is it appropriate to ask her to start paying

05:00.160 --> 05:05.200
utilities or even rent? I know this seems obvious, but we're in college and she's still

05:05.200 --> 05:10.320
paying for her own apartment until the lease ends in August. So I feel sort of bad, but at the same

05:10.320 --> 05:16.640
time, me and my other roommates feel as though we're basically paying her to live here. Brothers,

05:16.640 --> 05:22.640
what are we to do? That's from disgruntled in Delaware. There's I think, I don't think this

05:22.640 --> 05:29.600
issue is as black and white as it, as it seems. No, this question should be called how horrible

05:29.600 --> 05:35.760
it is to be in college. Yeah. Cause this I I'm guarantee you live with six people, right? You

05:35.760 --> 05:40.720
live with six people in a three bedroom house. That's thorny. No matter which way you slice it,

05:40.720 --> 05:46.880
she squatters. She now you have complained that she uses the toilet and I would not bring,

05:46.880 --> 05:53.360
I would not bring that up when you approach her like, Hey, every, every flush, every dump flush

05:53.360 --> 05:59.760
you do. It's like, she's not going to piggy bank on the back of the toilet. She's not going to admit

05:59.760 --> 06:04.800
to her boyfriend that she uses the bathroom for another couple of years. So you don't want to,

06:04.800 --> 06:10.720
you don't want to blow up her spot this soon. Also, I would say that internet and cable might

06:10.720 --> 06:16.240
not be a good argument because they're completely renewable resources. It's not like she's using up

06:16.240 --> 06:27.440
anything. You used up all of my Nickelodeon. Yeah. Can I be honest? Like if I don't think

06:27.440 --> 06:32.960
the right solution is to ask for money. Like I don't, I don't think that's the right. I think

06:32.960 --> 06:40.160
if you're uncomfortable with how much time she is spending there, then I think that you should ask,

06:40.160 --> 06:47.040
talk to the guy about it. Talk to her too. Well, no, I don't, I don't mean that. I don't mean that

06:47.040 --> 06:52.400
in a misogynist way. I mean that in like a, like he's the one, you know, presumably a little bit

06:52.400 --> 06:56.080
better and it's going to be more comfortable. I don't mean like a man makes the decisions for

06:56.640 --> 07:01.520
here's the thing. Unless she's like invited herself in and some kind of crazy person way,

07:01.520 --> 07:07.280
he brought her into the apartment. He's having her spend the night. What are you talking about?

07:07.280 --> 07:14.240
I'm saying the responsibility is on your roommate, not her. I want to know about the crazy person

07:14.240 --> 07:18.800
way in which she's, is she secretly secretly living in the house? Like a, like a borable?

07:18.800 --> 07:24.720
Is that what's going on? Well, I'm not necessarily going that far, but so much as it's like,

07:24.720 --> 07:29.520
she never goes home now and she just like hangs out there all the time. And he's too afraid of

07:29.520 --> 07:35.840
her to like ask her to maybe spend the night at her own house once or twice a week. So I might

07:35.840 --> 07:40.080
be really physically intimidating is what I'm saying. She's like a witch. You mean a witch?

07:40.080 --> 07:46.880
Yes. He's cursed with. Thank you. A witch that inhabits the eaves of her house. Is this what

07:46.880 --> 07:50.880
you're saying? Maybe she's, maybe she sneaks down into the kitchen and steals all of his fruit. And

07:50.880 --> 07:58.240
also she's tiny cause she's a borable. I don't think a borable is what you think it is. Is it

07:58.240 --> 08:03.120
not like this? I think you're thinking of borrowers. God damn it. A borable is a thing,

08:03.120 --> 08:08.160
but I think it's like a rat like child. What? I don't know. I think it's a book

08:08.160 --> 08:13.440
dad used to read and talk about borables. I think it's a book dad made up. Let me cruise

08:13.440 --> 08:19.840
into this borables well for a second. So there's a trilogy. They're written by an English author

08:19.840 --> 08:26.640
and they're runaway children who eventually become borabled. And when they wake up,

08:26.640 --> 08:31.200
they find their ears have been pointed. Okay. So they are rat like children. They are very similar

08:31.200 --> 08:36.880
to, to elves and pixies of English folklore. What I meant is that your girlfriend's a borrower.

08:36.880 --> 08:42.480
Your roommate's girlfriend is a borrower. And unless he's a borrower, I don't know. I can't get

08:42.480 --> 08:46.720
behind borrower crossbreeding. I don't mean to sound like that's not, I don't want to sound

08:46.720 --> 08:51.200
bigoted. I don't want to sound bigoted, but just like the physics of it is kind of gross to think

08:51.200 --> 08:56.960
about, you know, a hundred episodes in and the truth comes out. Your freak, your flag flies.

08:58.000 --> 09:04.560
I'm still so disappointed. Your, your flag, you're flying your flag of hatred, the hatred,

09:04.560 --> 09:11.520
hate tolerance and intolerant flag. I think the only time it's appropriate to ask a girlfriend

09:11.520 --> 09:16.880
that's like staying over for rent is if she does not have her own place. You know what I mean? If

09:16.880 --> 09:22.480
it's like, well, my lease, no, I'm saying like, if she's like crashing there for a month or two,

09:22.480 --> 09:28.000
like until, you know, if she finds another place or something, then you sure as fuck ask for rent.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.560
This is like, she has an offshore bank account though. Like she has an apartment that she pays

09:32.560 --> 09:39.040
$13 a month for. Cause it's awful. But she stays here on the free skis. Cause she can always say,

09:39.040 --> 09:44.320
oh no, no, no. I mainly incorporated over on six, the dirty part of it,

09:44.320 --> 09:50.400
but you know, this is, and this is where it gets to, especially if you're not paying for water,

09:50.400 --> 09:56.400
if like water is included in your rent, you got no, you have no like to stand on. Yeah. You know

09:56.400 --> 10:02.880
what I mean? But maybe it's just like, I think here, I think that the money thing is not at the

10:02.880 --> 10:10.240
root of this, the root of it is a sort of place to hang your hat, but really like she's there all the

10:10.240 --> 10:15.760
time. Yeah. And this is your, especially if she's there when he's not putting your foot down. This

10:15.760 --> 10:24.240
is like your place. Like, you know, any boyfriend, girlfriend, like you get a house and you think,

10:24.240 --> 10:26.640
okay, well the three of us are going to live here and it's going to be a little crowded,

10:26.640 --> 10:31.200
but whatever we'll make ends meet. Like, and then you have this other person who's always there and

10:31.200 --> 10:35.040
you don't know them and they're not paying anything. So you resent them. Is it also that

10:35.040 --> 10:43.120
he just wants to play Madden and make dude farts? Could that be possible? I wanted to eat this

10:43.120 --> 10:46.480
oversized plate of chicken wings and make dude farts. And you're here all the time,

10:46.480 --> 10:51.040
classing up the place. I'm not saying that women can't eat chicken wings and play Madden and

10:51.600 --> 10:56.320
make dude farts. That's not what I'm saying. That is exactly what women do when there aren't men

10:56.320 --> 11:02.320
around. I'm just saying the mixing of the sexes. When you mix, when you crossbreed, you can't,

11:02.320 --> 11:07.120
you can't, you crossbreed men and women does not believe in breeding between men and women. No,

11:08.160 --> 11:12.720
no, it's disgusting. How did the parts even match up at that point? You know,

11:12.720 --> 11:19.520
it says in the Bible, you must be equally yoked and that cannot apply if one of you is a man

11:19.520 --> 11:25.040
and one of you is a woman. It's disgusting. Like if you're not dong slapping, which is

11:26.560 --> 11:30.320
when you hit two dongs together, like the thunder sticks at a stadium,

11:30.320 --> 11:37.040
like at a sports game. Um, or I don't have a name for what it is when you do it to vaginas.

11:38.400 --> 11:44.640
Okay. Yeah. Oh, can we not, you're going to have to bleep that out. Yeah. Oh, I will.

11:45.520 --> 11:50.000
It wouldn't be our hundredth episode without getting feverish questions about what horrible

11:50.000 --> 11:58.480
thing Travis said that we had to bleep out. Um, I hate you. I, I, you just got to talk to him and

11:58.480 --> 12:03.600
say, listen, either, I don't think you can go halfway on this. Either she becomes a fourth

12:03.600 --> 12:11.200
roommate and she's there all the time or wait a minute. The lease ends in August. Yeah. Oh,

12:11.200 --> 12:16.560
right. That's, that's a, that's a hike. That's a ways out. Yeah. Um, I don't think the money's

12:16.560 --> 12:21.200
going to fix your problem though. I think she just needs to stop being there so much. And I

12:21.200 --> 12:26.080
think that's really what's bothering you. I think four or five days a week is way too much. I think

12:26.080 --> 12:32.320
like two or three is fine, especially. And here's the other thing. If she was just like getting

12:32.320 --> 12:36.160
there at like eight o'clock at night, they'd watch a movie and then she'd spend the night

12:36.160 --> 12:39.920
and then she'd leave in the morning and go to class. But the fact that she's showering

12:39.920 --> 12:44.000
twice and doing her lawn, she's squatting in your home. She's literally squatting because

12:44.000 --> 12:49.680
she's using your toilet and that's not okay. That's inappropriate. You should put, you know,

12:49.680 --> 12:54.800
you got to put nails on the toilet seat like they do to keep pigeons off of subway stops.

12:54.800 --> 12:59.680
That doesn't mean that is wholly impractical. That's exactly what you need to do. Now that

13:00.640 --> 13:07.200
literally, literally, uh, we asked you guys, uh, those of you who we've helped and I was using

13:07.200 --> 13:12.160
air quotes over the years, we asked you to check in with us to tell us how things are going, how

13:12.160 --> 13:16.560
things are going with you. How did it work out? Uh, even though we do advise you to never take

13:16.560 --> 13:24.960
our advice. Uh, we're very clear about that. Um, some of you still do occasionally. Um, Travis,

13:24.960 --> 13:30.960
give me a check-in. What's, what's the story out there? You answered my question in episode 29,

13:30.960 --> 13:36.800
the quickening. My question was in regard to my older boyfriend, me 28, him 52. And my fear is

13:36.800 --> 13:42.160
about introducing him to my friends. I cracked up at your world's greatest grandpa slash boyfriend

13:42.160 --> 13:47.360
riff, but you eventually gave me some real advice. I would disagree saying that my friends would be

13:47.360 --> 13:52.320
cool. It turns out they were all my friends are now his friends and we've been together for two

13:52.320 --> 13:56.800
years. Thanks brothers. And congrats on your hundredth episode. I listen every week and I'm

13:56.800 --> 14:01.920
a proud maximum fund supporter due to you. You joke, but you really do help more than you think

14:01.920 --> 14:06.320
your faithful listener. Yes. I know it's weird. Oh yes. I know it's weird. I'm so happy to hear

14:06.320 --> 14:10.080
from you. That's so nice. I remember that question. I'm glad everything worked out.

14:10.080 --> 14:16.960
Me too. Why does he take our advice? We did. We are very clear about this. Usually we are in no

14:16.960 --> 14:22.240
way legally responsible for anything. Sometimes give so much different advice that you would

14:22.240 --> 14:26.240
almost, I mean, you almost have to make it. We throw the, we throw the advice spaghetti against

14:26.240 --> 14:32.240
the wall and sometimes something sticks, but for every, for every one piece of spaghetti that does

14:32.240 --> 14:37.920
stick to the wall, like 80 pieces fall to the ground. And so in that respect and crush your dog,

14:37.920 --> 14:43.440
we may help more giant pieces of spaghetti. We may help more than we think, but we also hurt

14:43.440 --> 14:48.320
way, way more than we could ever calculate. Right. Because now you got mice. Look at this

14:48.320 --> 14:53.520
pasta on the floor. This is an issue. We need to get, we need to get somebody in here to clean.

14:53.520 --> 14:56.160
But thank you for listening. And I'm glad that we could help. Thank you so much.

14:57.040 --> 15:01.200
Thanks for being a maximum fund supporter. Yeah. Yeah. You guys did amazing with that stuff. We

15:01.200 --> 15:07.840
won't harp on it too much, but you guys are just the best humans. A billion dollars. Yeah. Well,

15:07.840 --> 15:11.760
we raised a billion dollars. A billion dollars a month. Yeah. A billion dollars

15:11.760 --> 15:13.200
isn't cool though. You know, it's cool.

15:15.520 --> 15:19.120
Yahoo answer? Yahoo answer question. I thought you were going for a transition.

15:19.120 --> 15:24.960
No, we're, we're really, we're really rich now. The three of us are getting to a point where

15:24.960 --> 15:36.320
we are, I would say we're careening towards pay to hunt Eastern European people in a forest.

15:36.320 --> 15:41.120
Like that's about where we're, we're about like hostile rich. I have actually at this point over,

15:41.120 --> 15:50.000
I took over a serfdom. Did you? Yeah. I have a whole army of serfs now. You know, so rewarding,

15:50.800 --> 15:56.000
but it is watching the twinkle in their eye as I give them some services is one of,

15:56.000 --> 16:01.840
I think one of the most rewarding investments you can make. My one piece of advice to you,

16:01.840 --> 16:07.440
keep your eye on Frankie and Annette because they will, they will get out of hand.

16:08.000 --> 16:19.360
Serfs. No, I got you. Serving. Uh-huh. Uh, so surfing. Yeah. No, no. Yeah. I know.

16:19.360 --> 16:23.040
It's funny. Cause, cause they're homonyms. Okay. They sound the same, but they're spelled

16:23.040 --> 16:27.520
different. Here we go. Uh, this Yahoo answer is sent by, I don't think two homonyms should get

16:27.520 --> 16:34.320
married there. I'm sorry. Stop it. This Yahoo answer is sent in by Earl Parsons. Thank you,

16:34.320 --> 16:42.000
Earl. It's by Yahoo answers user Bob, but not a builder who asks, why do kids think it's cool

16:42.000 --> 16:49.200
to sag if they don't know the real meaning of it? Correct me if I'm wrong, but in prison,

16:49.200 --> 16:52.640
if you sag, does that mean you are owned by someone else in the prison?

16:52.640 --> 17:01.440
I, this, this, this is, this is absolutely a guidance counselor who's wanting to go to

17:01.440 --> 17:06.720
school next day and just fucking nail people like, Hey, you know what that means? I read

17:06.720 --> 17:14.080
on the internet. He's setting up his own scared straight scenario. Is that what that means?

17:14.080 --> 17:19.040
It seems counterintuitive to me to, if you are in prison and you belong to someone,

17:19.040 --> 17:24.480
if you were meant for them and they were meant for you, um, and you, and you show off your,

17:25.040 --> 17:31.040
your, your plumage, you know, if you air it out and you show it off and you say, this is mine,

17:31.040 --> 17:36.080
this is what I'm working with. You jealous. It seems like, I dunno, it seems like a better thing

17:36.080 --> 17:40.480
to do would be to like cover it up as much as you possibly could hoist it up to like your armpit.

17:40.480 --> 17:44.800
Like when you get married in real life, you don't, you don't, you know, walk around

17:44.800 --> 17:53.200
hanging brain, I guess. Yeah. You know what I mean? It's like you were, you were in a committed,

17:53.200 --> 17:58.800
you were in a beautiful and committed relationship. Um, if I get married in prison to a,

17:59.360 --> 18:04.960
I believe I'm not attempting to offend you. I believe the nomenclature is bitch. When I get

18:04.960 --> 18:12.560
married to a bitch in prison, I, what? Justin. Yes. You would be the bitch. Okay. Okay. I mean,

18:12.560 --> 18:20.160
I'm just saying I will, I will commit myself to our man in such a way that I will wear a full tarp

18:20.800 --> 18:26.960
that I have fashioned out of paper towels. I saw when the warden wasn't looking and no,

18:26.960 --> 18:33.440
no other man, other than big Ricky Jay is going to have his cart thrower. You will not,

18:33.440 --> 18:40.160
you will not be allowed to be in a room alone with a man who is not your, uh, your, I guess,

18:40.160 --> 18:46.080
butt King. What are they called? You will not be allowed to be in a room alone with a man who is

18:46.080 --> 18:52.240
not your butt King, except for the hundreds and hundreds of men that you like legally have to

18:52.240 --> 18:58.320
stay in a room alone with all the time because you're in prison. Right. But I'll be very cool

18:58.320 --> 19:03.840
to them. I would be very distant. Oh, just an ice, just an ice thousand yard stare. Just really

19:03.840 --> 19:12.560
inaccessible. They'll try to chat me up about, I don't know how about that morning. You think

19:12.560 --> 19:21.440
they're only talking about breakout Kings and uh, like Alcatraz last night. I wish we could

19:21.440 --> 19:24.160
disappear and travel in time and then Hurley would be there for some reason.

19:26.320 --> 19:31.360
I don't like living in a universe in which there's a secret code enclosed that I'm unaware of.

19:31.360 --> 19:36.720
Is this what a couple of questions. First off, are our kids still doing this?

19:38.320 --> 19:44.880
Yes. Well, okay. Now I'm getting some, I'm getting some conflicting reports on it. My kids aren't

19:44.880 --> 19:51.120
doing it. Okay. God knows. Now here's, I counter argument. Okay. Yesterday when I saw the three

19:51.120 --> 19:57.280
suges, the, there was a part where Larry, let me finish. There's a part where you,

19:57.280 --> 20:03.280
you had to torpedo our comedy by bringing that poison into it. Let me finish. There was a pretty

20:03.280 --> 20:10.240
good bit where a gentleman walked past Larry and he said, Oh, your pants are hanging down.

20:10.240 --> 20:16.080
Let me help you. And then he pulled them up. So that is at least, I think their kids must still

20:16.080 --> 20:20.400
be doing it. Cause why else would it be in the three suges? Well, as you all know, three suges

20:20.400 --> 20:25.200
has their finger on the pulse of the youth nation. I actually, after watching the film,

20:25.200 --> 20:32.160
I can confirm it has the finger on the pulse of euthanasia. I actually really, uh, ready to,

20:32.160 --> 20:37.200
ready to go afterwards. But, um, well, pretty good, pretty good, pretty good flick.

20:37.200 --> 20:43.840
I feel like I don't see, I live in Austin. So I see kids wearing their pants actually tighter and

20:43.840 --> 20:50.400
higher up than, than the average, the national average. Um, they like them tight and high here.

20:50.400 --> 20:56.480
So high and tight hearing says, Hey, I've seen this thing where kids only wear one leg of their

20:56.480 --> 21:03.840
pants at a time. Explain please. Well, you kind of alternate the other one hangs down off their

21:03.840 --> 21:08.160
dong like an elephant trunk. No, it's just off to the side. You know, when on commercials, when

21:08.160 --> 21:12.240
people do the, I have big pants cause they lost a bunch of weight. Yeah. Yeah. It's like that,

21:12.240 --> 21:17.360
except the side of the pants extent and the other leg is naked. So do they hop around?

21:17.360 --> 21:22.480
Yeah. Like they put like the left leg of their pants on their right leg or they put the right

21:22.480 --> 21:27.600
leg of their pants on their left leg. So like the other side dangles impotently like a skip it.

21:28.240 --> 21:31.280
Yes. Yes. And then they skip it.

21:33.280 --> 21:37.440
The very best thing of all this bit doesn't make sense at all.

21:39.520 --> 21:47.200
Oh Christ. Um, I think, I don't know. I don't think that this is what this means in prison.

21:47.200 --> 21:52.080
I think there's another way of showing off, um, that I am committed, but I can't, who can't,

21:52.080 --> 21:56.880
who can keep track? People were talking about all the secret codes in prison. People,

21:57.920 --> 22:04.800
people talk about salad tossing a lot in prison movies. I have, I have in my life understood that

22:04.800 --> 22:10.400
to mean at least four different things. I S I do not know what that actually means. And I'm not

22:10.400 --> 22:16.080
sure any of the prisoners do do either. So what means sagging in one, like what sagging means in

22:16.080 --> 22:21.520
one prison may not mean the same thing. And another one does that, does that make sense?

22:21.520 --> 22:25.440
Um, I think I'm pretty sure that dong slapping is the only universal language of love.

22:26.240 --> 22:30.560
Yeah, that is true. Cause that's that that leaves nothing to the imagination. That is,

22:30.560 --> 22:34.160
that is as cut and dry as possible, except it is actually very wet.

22:34.880 --> 22:41.360
Even the name of it is perfectly descriptive. Yeah. When I say dong slapping, you know exactly

22:41.360 --> 22:45.360
what I'm talking about. It conjures a horrifying mental image that you just can't get out of your

22:45.360 --> 22:50.640
head. Horrifying the sound. It's all the sound. It's actually. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's actually quite

22:50.640 --> 22:57.520
romantic. Did you see that episode of planet earth when the two cheetahs did it? There's never

22:57.520 --> 23:03.280
been a more beautiful expression of power in this world. I don't think. Hey guys, Phil from Cincinnati

23:03.280 --> 23:08.240
here. Wanted to call and congratulate you on your 100th episode. I've written in twice and you've

23:08.240 --> 23:13.920
helped me both times on how to talk to my coworkers and also how to get my friends to wash their hands

23:13.920 --> 23:20.960
after they use the bathroom. So thanks again. Take care. Hey, my man. This is known. My man,

23:20.960 --> 23:27.840
fan who's mom Mariko. And I'd like to congratulate you on your 100th episode. And I'll look forward

23:27.840 --> 23:34.720
for a hundred more. Lots of laughs, lots of giggles and lots of wiggles. I suppose I am

23:34.720 --> 23:40.720
planning on asking my lady friend for her hand in marriage. My grandma has made it known to me that

23:40.720 --> 23:47.680
she would like my girlfriend to have her, my grandma's engagement ring. If I give my girl,

23:47.680 --> 23:53.840
my nanny's ring, she will think it is a sweet sentiment or will I look like an el cheapo for

23:53.840 --> 23:59.760
not shelling out for a brand new ring. Brothers help a brother. That's betwixt in Bethune,

23:59.760 --> 24:06.720
South Carolina. Bethune. Is that the right pronunciation? Bethune. Bethune. Bethune.

24:06.720 --> 24:14.160
Bethany. Bethany. Okay. Oh shit. You fucked that up so hard. There's no why guys. I don't know

24:14.160 --> 24:20.880
what el cheapo means. I don't think that anyone has ever received a like, man, I almost said the

24:20.880 --> 24:27.600
phrase hand me down ring. Not what I meant. Finger me down heirloom heirloom ring and been like,

24:27.600 --> 24:32.800
Oh, to cheat to buy your own, huh? Like, I don't think that that translates. It depends on how

24:32.800 --> 24:36.800
shitty your grandma's ring is straight up. What are you dealing with? How many carat is it like

24:36.800 --> 24:42.080
a ring pop? If it's a ring pot, then, oh, well, I mean, if it's a ring pop with candy on top,

24:42.080 --> 24:46.640
then that's bad. But if it's a ring pop with a ring pop size diamond, that would also probably

24:46.640 --> 24:51.360
be back. She couldn't really do anything with that hand anymore. The good thing about this,

24:51.360 --> 24:56.880
uh, question is that you don't actually have to figure out the answer beforehand. Let me explain.

24:57.680 --> 25:01.920
If you go to her, you hand her the ring, you tell her the story behind the ring,

25:01.920 --> 25:09.200
tell her it's sort of a family heirloom type thing. You watch her face. If she is touched

25:09.200 --> 25:13.200
and thrilled just at the prospect of the two of you getting married and the fact that you gave her

25:13.200 --> 25:19.040
such a treasured family heirloom, you got a keeper. Great. If you see for a second, something flick

25:19.040 --> 25:23.920
across her face that you did not buy the ring and she's as pleased by that, you snatch that ring

25:23.920 --> 25:29.200
back, you make a run for a plate glass window, you smash through it and you never look back.

25:29.200 --> 25:34.320
Okay. You took a much more extreme second option than I thought you were going to say. No way.

25:34.320 --> 25:38.960
No, you listen to me. You smash through the plate glass window and you never look back

25:38.960 --> 25:43.360
because you did it bad. You thought you were doing good when you dated her. You did a bad job.

25:43.360 --> 25:48.960
You found a bad partner. Could he not just say like, no, I've got this ring until I like can get,

25:49.520 --> 25:56.160
you know, a different one. No, no, no, no. You gotta go, plan your escape, check the gauge of

25:56.160 --> 25:59.600
the plate glass. Cause if it's too thick, you're just going to bounce right off and that'll be

25:59.600 --> 26:01.600
embarrassing. Could you use your grandmother's ring to cut through the plate glass window?

26:01.600 --> 26:09.600
This is it. This is it. This is a good idea. Yes. Use the ring, use the ring. And then you're

26:09.600 --> 26:14.800
going to find out if you're giving her some whack cubic zirconia. Like you use the ring to score

26:14.800 --> 26:21.280
basically a section of the glass that you will be able to smash through. Yeah. A mark shaped hole.

26:21.280 --> 26:26.480
You just make a mark shaped hole where Mark can take a run at it and just really smash through.

26:26.480 --> 26:30.000
Please, please propose to her on the first floor of a building. Yeah. I was about to say,

26:30.000 --> 26:35.440
make sure you plan it on a low level, maybe second, but low level. But listen to me nephew,

26:35.440 --> 26:40.080
you give her that ring and she's disappointed that you didn't buy it yourself. You got to run.

26:40.080 --> 26:47.760
You have to run because you did it bad. Um, and get the ring back because your money is going to

26:47.760 --> 26:54.160
be pretty upset. Um, well she'll be upset either way. That's her, that's her fucking ring. Just

26:54.160 --> 26:59.600
let your nonny have her ring. God damn it. Not the only thing she has left. Hey nonny,

26:59.600 --> 27:04.640
do you mind if I grave robber you while you're still alive? I may be in love with this girl.

27:04.640 --> 27:08.720
I can't, I can't figure it out until I try to give her your ring. Yeah. Uh, I gave,

27:08.720 --> 27:15.280
I gave Sydney our nonny's ring and she loved it. I mean, it was because it,

27:15.280 --> 27:19.680
it, if you have the right, if you're getting involved with the right kind of person,

27:19.680 --> 27:26.960
they will understand that things like family and things that have been passed down this way

27:26.960 --> 27:38.320
have more value than a billion dollar ring. Uh, I don't know. Well, well, if I pawn,

27:38.320 --> 27:48.320
I have a chart. If I pawn my nonny's ring, I can get maybe a half gram of meth. Right. Okay. But

27:48.320 --> 27:53.440
if I, you're right. You got to figure it out. If X is the value of how much you love your nonny

27:53.440 --> 27:59.360
and how much she means to you versus how old the ring is and the carrot, you can figure out a dollar

27:59.360 --> 28:04.640
amount. I guess is that, if that's what you're saying. That is it. Well, I was just saying that

28:04.640 --> 28:08.800
anytime you pawn something, I don't think anybody's ever pawned anything and then not spent the money

28:08.800 --> 28:14.560
on, on methamphetamines. They actually started to do it using that metric in pawn stars. Yeah. They

28:14.560 --> 28:21.120
say, you know, I have this, I have this authentic Roy Rogers shirt that he wore in a shuffle down

28:21.120 --> 28:26.800
to Buffalo. Can I have three grams of meth for this? And they would say, no, I'll give you two,

28:26.800 --> 28:33.200
two crystals. How is it okay to propose to your girlfriend with your grandmother's meth? Yeah,

28:33.200 --> 28:42.480
sure. And I would like to think that you probably know the answer to this. Yeah. Like I would hope

28:42.480 --> 28:49.120
that, you know, if that will mean something to her. I understand what you're, I don't understand

28:49.120 --> 28:54.720
what you're saying, but the, the sentiment in this case will mean more than the, than the dollar

28:54.720 --> 29:03.440
amount. And what's Griffin? You don't agree. I'm just, I had a thought. What if it's a, what if it's

29:03.440 --> 29:13.520
a toe ring? He didn't, he didn't specify or like a belly button ring. It could be any number of rings

29:14.960 --> 29:19.840
to get engaged in. Cause it doesn't say anywhere that engagement ring has to be a gold band with

29:19.840 --> 29:25.440
a little diamond on top of it. I don't think. Does it? It probably does say that somewhere. Yeah.

29:25.440 --> 29:31.760
Where would it say that? In the book, the book, the book, the book of sales, the book,

29:31.760 --> 29:40.000
open your Bible. So the book of sales, if it's a toe ring, then it's a toe ring. Your grandma is

29:40.000 --> 29:47.120
whack. You have a wack nanny and you need to get a new nanny first and then new wife priorities.

29:47.120 --> 29:51.280
Cause your nanny may not be with you forever. You're going to need two plate glass windows

29:51.280 --> 29:56.960
or one very large, very rich. Okay. So you go to your nanny, you say, I'm ready to propose to

29:56.960 --> 30:03.120
Bethany in Bethune. Uh, I need, I need your rig. If you see her reaching for the shoe,

30:03.120 --> 30:07.040
you run at that plate glass and you smash it out. Cause you're done with that money.

30:07.040 --> 30:13.120
You need a new one. New nanny. You find nanny too. She says, I keep my rings on my finger like an

30:13.120 --> 30:20.080
adult. Then you go to your grave robber and then you go to your girlfriend. Yeah. And you say,

30:20.080 --> 30:26.480
I got this ring from neo nanny and I need, and I want you to be mine. And then she says,

30:26.480 --> 30:34.640
did you buy that? Was it on a toe? You say, uh, no to both. Find that other plate glass,

30:34.640 --> 30:39.360
smash it, run back to nanny, realize that you went back to first nanny, say, oh,

30:39.360 --> 30:44.960
fuck smash through another one. And by this point you are probably cut to ribbons. I'm pretty tired.

30:44.960 --> 30:47.600
You're probably very tired. Cause this all happened in like two minutes. And then

30:47.600 --> 30:51.760
go to Jared's. Then you go to Jared's and you get it right. You just go to Jared, do it right.

30:53.520 --> 30:58.640
Travis. And then find a new girlfriend. At Jared's. She works the cashier. She knows her stuff.

30:59.440 --> 31:05.920
She's a good, she's a good lady. Propose to her. Travis. Uh-huh. Hey brothers. Help anybody else?

31:05.920 --> 31:12.000
Nope. But, um, hey brothers. I was the one who wrote a while back asking if the height difference

31:12.000 --> 31:16.480
between this girl that I like was a deal breaker. She is several inches taller than me. I'm happy

31:16.480 --> 31:20.560
to report that I took your advice and asked her out. We have been happily dating for almost four

31:20.560 --> 31:25.760
months. She usually wears flats. So we're about the same height. Anyway, thanks for the help guys.

31:25.760 --> 31:30.320
You're awesome. And that's from compact in Kentucky. Oh, that's good to hear. That's good to

31:30.320 --> 31:34.960
hear. But I feel like pretty much anybody would have told you that thing. We told you. Yeah.

31:34.960 --> 31:40.080
That was not a tough one. Did you talk to anyone else before us? Were we your first step?

31:41.120 --> 31:48.480
Oh Christ, I hope not. That's like the one thing you can't do. What kind of horrible brand of dude

31:48.480 --> 31:54.880
would you have to talk to that'd be like, oh, she's taller than you? No way. No way. Get out of time.

31:55.680 --> 32:02.000
Let's just sit around and make dude farts. Pass the Madden Troller. Did you ask Charlie Sheen

32:02.000 --> 32:09.600
about this before you came to us? He's a very diminutive man, right? I think Charlie Sheen?

32:09.600 --> 32:15.120
He's diminutive and horrible. Like some sort of troll. Like some sort of swamp monster. Hey guys,

32:15.120 --> 32:22.160
check this out. Check this out. Winning. Oh boy. Remember, it was in Three Stooges,

32:22.160 --> 32:26.080
there was a... Is there a scene in Three Stooges where they quote Charlie Sheen?

32:26.080 --> 32:32.800
Is that what you're saying? No, but there is a scene where... Justin, I don't want to hear it.

32:33.760 --> 32:39.200
It's a scene. No, you do have to hear it. Have to? Have to hear it? For 20 minutes,

32:39.920 --> 32:43.040
maybe 25, it felt like seven hours. That's a pretty good length for a scene. Yeah.

32:44.640 --> 32:50.320
Well, it's comprised of three shorts, three half hour long shorts. The movie is? Yeah.

32:50.320 --> 32:57.840
Are you? And in the movie for about half hour, Moe is part of the cast of Jersey Shore.

32:59.520 --> 33:08.480
Dynamo, as they refer to him. Dynamo. Dynamo. Dynamo. Dynamo. He's a part of the Jersey Shore.

33:08.480 --> 33:12.160
If you do this, I'm going to start talking about how I watched Joe Dirt yesterday.

33:12.160 --> 33:15.680
I don't want to do this. I'm just telling you guys I saw it. It's pretty good.

33:15.680 --> 33:20.080
I'm just saying that we will do mutually assured joke destruction if you keep talking about Three

33:20.080 --> 33:24.560
Stages, I will bring up Joe Dirt. Let's talk about anything else then. Okay. Anything else?

33:24.560 --> 33:30.640
Guys, I watched Hudson Hawk yesterday and let me- No! No! You son of a bitch. How about a Yahoo

33:30.640 --> 33:39.680
answer? Please. This Yahoo answer was sent in by Galiayali. Thank you, Gali. It's by Yahoo

33:39.680 --> 33:46.320
answers user Lola, who asks, will standing up and eating help me get a fatter butt,

33:46.320 --> 33:56.800
not a bigger, rounder, skinnier butt, a fat, juicy butt? I don't want to exorcise her because

33:56.800 --> 34:02.720
that made my thighs and my butt skinny. I want a fat, delicious, juicy butt and also thighs.

34:02.720 --> 34:04.320
Please stop saying that.

34:04.320 --> 34:10.080
I want a fat, delicious, juicy butt and also thighs. Will standing up and eating help me do that?

34:10.080 --> 34:15.120
Can you read, Griffin? Can I make a special request-

34:15.120 --> 34:17.280
I want a fat, delicious, juicy butt.

34:17.280 --> 34:23.200
Thank you. That was what I was going to request, actually. So if you want a fat,

34:23.200 --> 34:28.320
delicious, juicy butt, there are three things you must do.

34:28.320 --> 34:35.760
Okay. First, avoid those workout tapes by Fonda. That's number, that's super key.

34:35.760 --> 34:41.040
Yeah. They'll give you a light bulb figure and you do not want that. You want an upside down light

34:41.040 --> 34:46.640
bulb. Yeah. And you don't want that. And neither does my anaconda. Travis' anaconda is very

34:46.640 --> 34:52.080
particular about fat. Just the juiciest butt for me.

34:52.080 --> 34:56.160
Now you did not comment on the flavor of the butt. And I feel like that's an important modifier.

34:56.960 --> 34:58.240
Like a sweet, juicy butt?

34:58.240 --> 35:06.000
Oh, Christ. This is a very hoppy butt. This is a very bitter.

35:06.960 --> 35:11.360
What year is this butt? What year is this butt? This is a fine butt vintage.

35:11.360 --> 35:16.640
Let me tell you, I just started seeing someone. She is just marbled down there. It's wonderful.

35:17.840 --> 35:23.200
This is a juicy butt with some hints of, what is that? Grape, tobacco.

35:23.200 --> 35:26.800
You can't smell it though. I didn't mean so. I was sniffling.

35:26.800 --> 35:31.280
You can't smell the butt. You find the butt and it tastes juicy.

35:32.080 --> 35:34.240
You swish it around in your mouth and then you spit it out.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.960
It's so important that you don't swallow the butt.

35:36.960 --> 35:41.760
I, guys, no. I'm butt drunk. Help. You don't get butt drunk.

35:42.400 --> 35:45.200
My favorite scene in Sideways with Leslie.

35:51.440 --> 35:56.240
I could choose your own adventure on that. I'll leave that. You can email the way that bit

35:56.240 --> 36:00.640
concludes to us. I'll give you a mailing address in a second.

36:00.640 --> 36:06.960
Can you move food around your body like some sort of food wizard like this? I didn't know.

36:08.640 --> 36:10.800
You mean by standing up, gravity takes care of it?

36:10.800 --> 36:17.280
If you do a headstand while eating burritos, then you get really, really toned calves.

36:17.280 --> 36:21.360
If you lie on your back and you drink a milkshake, you get a fat back.

36:21.360 --> 36:26.240
That's the last thing you want. That's why it's so important not to eat lying down.

36:28.160 --> 36:32.800
That's why hospital beds sit you up so it angles the food to your butt.

36:32.800 --> 36:37.760
Exactly. You actually have to do that thing that they always do in the comedic hospital

36:37.760 --> 36:43.360
scenes where the bed goes haywire and bends them up into a V. You gotta do that so it all settles.

36:43.360 --> 36:47.520
All the blood in your body is just in your fat, delicious, juicy butt.

36:47.520 --> 36:52.000
Well, I just worry that if you did it standing up, you're going to end up with fat, juicy,

36:52.000 --> 36:54.080
delicious feet. That's the worst.

36:55.520 --> 36:59.360
Unless you're some element on Craigslist.

37:01.120 --> 37:03.520
Unless you're a member of a certain community.

37:03.520 --> 37:06.400
Let's call them the feet guys.

37:06.400 --> 37:08.960
My brother and my brother made Fangirl. Ah, feet guys. That's right.

37:08.960 --> 37:16.160
Guys, I don't think much about my own butt.

37:19.120 --> 37:28.480
When I think about me, and I think about if my butt could be considered by myself or any

37:28.480 --> 37:35.040
outside party as being juicy, that's not a good... Any sort of dampness...

37:35.040 --> 37:38.880
I would like a light, airy butt.

37:38.880 --> 37:44.800
I would like a powdery butt. That's sort of my...

37:44.800 --> 37:46.640
A delicious, cakey butt.

37:46.640 --> 37:54.560
Something even cakey has intonations of moistness, which I cannot get behind.

37:54.560 --> 37:58.560
So like an overcooked, well done butt.

37:58.560 --> 38:05.760
Yeah, charred. Not like a bursting with fruit flavor. I want it...

38:05.760 --> 38:07.520
With a delicious, juicy center.

38:08.720 --> 38:11.200
Smoke to perfection is what you want your butt to be.

38:11.200 --> 38:13.040
You want a teriyaki jerked butt.

38:14.880 --> 38:22.080
Kim, I feel like this is actually an interesting place where the sexes divert in many cases,

38:22.080 --> 38:26.480
but not all. I feel like most women, if asked to describe their butt,

38:26.480 --> 38:31.200
could give you a few paragraphs on that, sort of their feelings on it.

38:31.200 --> 38:36.880
I, most of the time, could not be less aware of the fact that I have a butt.

38:36.880 --> 38:40.800
You know the only time I'm aware of my butt? Long car trips.

38:40.800 --> 38:41.360
Yeah, when it starts complaining.

38:41.360 --> 38:43.280
When I'm driving and my butt falls asleep.

38:43.280 --> 38:43.760
Yeah.

38:43.760 --> 38:46.960
If it's humid outside, things get a little juicy. I'm with you.

38:46.960 --> 38:50.640
No, it's because I have zero fat juiciness on my butt,

38:50.640 --> 38:54.560
and my butt bones dig directly into the car seats and tear them up.

38:54.560 --> 38:54.880
Yeah.

38:54.880 --> 39:00.560
So, so that's what Travis's butt is like.

39:02.560 --> 39:05.280
What was your nickname when you were taught, Trev?

39:05.280 --> 39:06.080
Bony butt boy.

39:07.920 --> 39:09.120
It's not a very good nickname.

39:09.120 --> 39:09.840
If you must know.

39:09.840 --> 39:10.480
It's legit.

39:12.080 --> 39:12.720
Oh man, that's a good show.

39:12.720 --> 39:14.560
That Travis McElroy, he's got a sharp ass.

39:15.600 --> 39:16.720
That's the sharp ass.

39:16.720 --> 39:18.160
The most acute butt.

39:19.040 --> 39:19.520
He sat...

39:19.520 --> 39:20.800
Not acute butt, mind you.

39:21.360 --> 39:22.640
Nope, nope, it's acute.

39:22.640 --> 39:26.800
He sat on Santa's lap at the Huntington Mall exactly once,

39:26.800 --> 39:29.760
and they would not let him back because that Santa lost his leg.

39:29.760 --> 39:30.720
No, that happened.

39:30.720 --> 39:31.200
It happened.

39:33.040 --> 39:35.280
Hey guys, I have a coworker.

39:35.280 --> 39:38.640
She leaves her stuff strewn about our offices.

39:39.200 --> 39:42.880
She only picks up after herself after being asked to do so several times,

39:42.880 --> 39:45.200
or she waits for someone else to do it for her.

39:45.200 --> 39:50.480
She also takes my supplies and doesn't return or replenish them.

39:50.480 --> 39:52.160
I don't want to make enemies in the office,

39:52.160 --> 39:55.360
especially since I work on a relatively small staff.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.480
How do I nicely ask her to be more considerate?

39:59.360 --> 40:02.080
That's from Irritated in Illinois.

40:02.880 --> 40:06.480
I think you post a note, a passive aggressive note.

40:06.480 --> 40:06.980
Yeah.

40:07.840 --> 40:08.560
Does that work?

40:08.560 --> 40:09.040
Can you-

40:09.040 --> 40:10.080
Hey Debra.

40:10.080 --> 40:10.580
Yeah.

40:11.120 --> 40:13.600
I noticed things have been getting a little out of hand lately,

40:14.800 --> 40:17.680
which reminds me I'm missing a stapler.

40:17.680 --> 40:19.040
Put it in my hand, please.

40:19.040 --> 40:21.040
Please.

40:21.040 --> 40:23.120
I'm pretty sure that's more active aggressive than you.

40:24.400 --> 40:24.960
Hey babe.

40:24.960 --> 40:25.460
Passage-

40:25.460 --> 40:26.800
Hey, how's Debra?

40:26.800 --> 40:27.680
Hey slut.

40:29.280 --> 40:29.780
No.

40:30.400 --> 40:30.880
No.

40:30.880 --> 40:33.200
You can't just say something in that sing song voice.

40:33.200 --> 40:35.360
Hey, where's my three hole punch?

40:35.360 --> 40:37.280
Hey, gonna burn your house down.

40:38.080 --> 40:38.720
Hey.

40:38.720 --> 40:39.920
Hey, how's it going?

40:40.880 --> 40:42.320
Gonna kill your dad.

40:44.560 --> 40:46.320
Bring back with the hole punch,

40:46.320 --> 40:48.960
or I'll put centipedes in your vagina.

40:48.960 --> 40:50.720
Oh, why?

40:50.720 --> 40:53.760
How would that self operation go down?

40:53.760 --> 40:54.960
Without you noticing.

40:54.960 --> 40:57.120
Without you noticing, I'm a wizard.

40:57.120 --> 40:57.520
Christ.

40:59.680 --> 41:02.560
Did you consider becoming a wizard or a witch?

41:02.560 --> 41:04.400
You can hide in the eaves of her home,

41:04.400 --> 41:06.320
flushing her toilet, watching her internet.

41:06.960 --> 41:08.720
A passive aggressive note would be like,

41:09.920 --> 41:13.040
boy, it sure would be nice if people would stop stealing office supplies.

41:13.040 --> 41:14.800
Oh, I gave myself a chill when I said that.

41:14.800 --> 41:16.480
We are not good at this.

41:16.480 --> 41:20.080
We are not good at aggressive, passive aggressive.

41:20.080 --> 41:23.280
Here's the one thing that we macarons can do.

41:23.280 --> 41:26.480
We stew and we stew and we stew.

41:26.480 --> 41:28.880
Then we get aggressive once, regular aggressive,

41:28.880 --> 41:30.400
and then we get embarrassed and we quit.

41:31.840 --> 41:33.040
That's our plan of attack.

41:33.040 --> 41:34.960
So I guess start working on your resume.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.240
I guess, yeah.

41:36.240 --> 41:38.640
Start reaching out to some of your LinkedIn contacts.

41:38.640 --> 41:42.480
Go get a stack of papers together and go to reach for the point

41:42.480 --> 41:44.960
where your stapler used to be and like,

41:44.960 --> 41:46.960
just stop with your hand in the air

41:46.960 --> 41:48.800
and lower your hand and just sigh deeply

41:49.840 --> 41:51.680
and do that like 50 times a day.

41:51.680 --> 41:53.280
Just every once in a while just announce,

41:53.280 --> 41:55.600
I miss my stapler.

41:55.600 --> 41:55.840
Yeah.

41:56.560 --> 41:58.800
That stapler was given to me by my nanny.

41:59.760 --> 42:01.680
Maybe you could start stealing things from her.

42:02.800 --> 42:06.000
And then you just have a drawer of all her stuff.

42:06.000 --> 42:06.800
Steal her man.

42:08.160 --> 42:08.960
Her identity.

42:08.960 --> 42:11.520
No, that is one way you can have all your stuff back.

42:11.520 --> 42:12.560
If you steal your identity,

42:12.560 --> 42:14.960
you'll be both her and you simultaneously.

42:14.960 --> 42:18.320
So you could just go and lift stuff off the desk.

42:18.320 --> 42:21.600
It'll be like that, what was that movie with Matt Dame?

42:21.600 --> 42:23.760
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.

42:23.760 --> 42:24.560
Good Will Hunting.

42:24.560 --> 42:25.060
No.

42:25.520 --> 42:26.020
No.

42:26.640 --> 42:27.140
It was-

42:27.140 --> 42:27.680
The Town of Mr. Ripley.

42:27.680 --> 42:28.180
Being John Malkovich.

42:29.040 --> 42:29.540
Yeah.

42:29.540 --> 42:31.040
Something, something, man's name.

42:32.640 --> 42:33.140
Right.

42:33.680 --> 42:35.520
I don't know how to lose a man in 10 days.

42:35.520 --> 42:37.040
I don't lose a man in 10 days.

42:37.040 --> 42:39.360
I don't lose a man in 10 days.

42:39.360 --> 42:40.240
Is that it?

42:40.240 --> 42:42.320
How to become a man in 10 days is what it was.

42:42.320 --> 42:43.280
How to become another man.

42:46.240 --> 42:46.740
Is this a-

42:47.760 --> 42:49.040
It's a fucking stapler.

42:50.240 --> 42:53.600
To me, I have a monetary value of how much I have to be

42:53.600 --> 42:55.840
inconvenienced before I'll start worrying about something

42:55.840 --> 42:57.840
and like put myself through that mental distress.

42:57.840 --> 42:59.040
And it's high, guys.

42:59.040 --> 43:01.280
It's like, it's like 150 bucks.

43:01.920 --> 43:02.960
Can I tell you guys something?

43:02.960 --> 43:06.640
But you're also, you're now amongst the super rich though.

43:06.640 --> 43:09.840
I'm incredibly, incredibly wealthy, but even before the

43:09.840 --> 43:13.440
Max Fund Drive filled my coffers to a preposterous degree,

43:13.440 --> 43:17.200
if someone would like clip my side view mirror and take off,

43:17.200 --> 43:19.360
I would be like, I would get their license plate number and

43:19.360 --> 43:20.720
I would promptly throw it away.

43:20.720 --> 43:22.720
Cause I can, I can fix that.

43:22.720 --> 43:23.520
That's not a big deal.

43:23.520 --> 43:25.040
They were probably in a hurry anyway.

43:25.600 --> 43:29.040
And let me tell you guys, I, I am the other side of this

43:29.040 --> 43:29.440
question.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.680
I'm the person with the messy desk that steals everyone's

43:31.680 --> 43:33.440
stapler and tape dispenser and white out.

43:33.440 --> 43:38.080
Oh, and I thrive on knowing that people aren't going to

43:38.080 --> 43:38.560
bring it up.

43:38.560 --> 43:41.440
Travis can't, Travis can't finish unless he knows he's

43:41.440 --> 43:43.680
suppressing somebody or some menial issue.

43:44.320 --> 43:48.560
Travis, you can loan Travis things like video games and he

43:48.560 --> 43:51.680
will insist several weeks later that he purchased that video

43:51.680 --> 43:52.400
game.

43:52.400 --> 43:55.280
And I'm talking about like things, things become mine.

43:55.280 --> 43:55.600
Yeah.

43:55.600 --> 43:59.600
A full library of games that I fully accept.

43:59.600 --> 44:01.840
I send his way and they will never return.

44:01.840 --> 44:04.880
He doesn't, he doesn't borrow things as much as he can

44:04.880 --> 44:05.920
scripts them.

44:05.920 --> 44:09.520
And the funny thing is I'm super, super anal about getting

44:09.520 --> 44:10.480
stuff back from people.

44:10.480 --> 44:13.040
Well, yes, but that's just because you're terrible.

44:13.840 --> 44:14.080
Yeah.

44:14.640 --> 44:16.080
They have a word for that.

44:16.080 --> 44:17.120
It's a hippo shit.

44:17.120 --> 44:18.640
You know, sorry.

44:18.640 --> 44:20.640
Neither a borrower nor a lender be.

44:20.640 --> 44:23.440
Travis takes that and he kind of makes it his own.

44:23.440 --> 44:25.120
He kind of puts his own spin on it.

44:26.560 --> 44:27.200
Like it's okay.

44:27.200 --> 44:29.360
It's cool to be a borrower, but fuck lending.

44:29.360 --> 44:32.400
I'm out Travis McElroy.

44:32.400 --> 44:32.720
Peace.

44:34.560 --> 44:35.600
No, Travis is a good dude.

44:35.600 --> 44:36.400
We like, we like.

44:36.400 --> 44:36.640
Yeah.

44:36.640 --> 44:37.440
Travis is great.

44:37.440 --> 44:38.800
That chance you got so much.

44:38.800 --> 44:39.760
I'm trying to get better at it.

44:39.760 --> 44:40.000
Yeah.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.440
I'm trying to get better.

44:41.440 --> 44:44.400
Not actively sure, but you know, like mentally I'm trying

44:44.400 --> 44:46.160
to become more okay with the fact that I do.

44:46.160 --> 44:46.400
Yeah.

44:48.880 --> 44:51.440
That is, that is our advice for everything.

44:51.440 --> 44:54.640
Don't fix your problems, but do accept them.

44:54.640 --> 44:56.160
So they're not problems anymore.

44:56.160 --> 44:57.120
They're quirks.

44:57.120 --> 45:00.400
If you could just like send me pictures of my seasons one

45:00.400 --> 45:02.640
through three of Smallville every once in a while, just

45:02.640 --> 45:04.800
so I can like catch up on how they're doing.

45:04.800 --> 45:06.400
Just like a quick status update.

45:06.400 --> 45:07.520
I just want to know.

45:07.520 --> 45:10.960
I'm practicing to be like a totalitarian dictator, like

45:10.960 --> 45:14.560
just slowly taking over annexing the areas around me.

45:14.560 --> 45:16.560
But I started with DVDs and videos.

45:16.560 --> 45:16.880
Sure.

45:16.880 --> 45:20.960
I organized my West Wing seasons yesterday and it was an easy

45:20.960 --> 45:23.200
job because it was one and six.

45:23.200 --> 45:25.600
You see something like that, you think, oops, must be Travis.

45:27.600 --> 45:28.880
Hey, my bim bam.

45:28.880 --> 45:31.440
Happy 100 years of podcasting.

45:32.960 --> 45:38.400
Hello, this is Ira Glass from the popular podcast, This

45:38.400 --> 45:39.120
American Life.

45:40.160 --> 45:44.800
And I'm here with Dan Savage from the popular podcast, Dan

45:44.800 --> 45:45.280
Savage.

45:45.280 --> 45:46.320
You can't come to the phone.

45:47.360 --> 45:50.720
I just want to say you kids are doing a bang up job and to

45:50.720 --> 45:53.920
keep up the good work, you know, 100, you know, that's really

45:53.920 --> 45:54.400
impressive.

45:54.400 --> 45:58.640
And I think you guys are going to are going to make it in this

45:58.640 --> 45:59.200
business.

45:59.200 --> 46:03.760
We got another check in email and it says, you answered my

46:03.760 --> 46:06.160
question on how to get my boyfriend to move from Chicago

46:06.160 --> 46:06.960
to Indianapolis.

46:06.960 --> 46:09.120
I'm happy to say that after listening to the episode, he

46:09.120 --> 46:11.120
mulled it over and he'll be moving here in about a month

46:11.120 --> 46:11.680
from now.

46:11.680 --> 46:14.160
I really think the part where Griffin threatened to kill him

46:14.160 --> 46:15.520
made all the difference.

46:15.520 --> 46:18.240
And that's from soon not to be isolated in Indianapolis.

46:18.240 --> 46:19.040
I don't remember.

46:19.040 --> 46:22.160
Is this the one where we talked about the pies and the

46:22.160 --> 46:24.640
cheesecake and then Griffin said he's going to kill someone?

46:24.640 --> 46:25.120
Yes.

46:25.120 --> 46:27.200
That doesn't sound like something I do, though.

46:27.760 --> 46:28.720
This is the baker.

46:29.600 --> 46:33.760
I definitely, I definitely, definitely killed someone in

46:33.760 --> 46:34.320
Chicago.

46:34.320 --> 46:39.680
So hence why you live in Austin under a different name.

46:39.680 --> 46:41.600
So what's your new name, Griffin?

46:41.600 --> 46:42.400
I meant to ask you.

46:42.400 --> 46:44.640
I've been wanting to send you a birthday card.

46:44.640 --> 46:47.120
It's Tyson with the letter T.

46:47.120 --> 46:49.520
Card it's Tyson with two S's.

46:51.920 --> 46:52.800
But no last name.

46:56.240 --> 46:57.200
I did some research.

46:57.200 --> 46:59.840
It's the most off the grid name that I could possibly write.

47:01.520 --> 47:02.320
I miss Griffin.

47:04.320 --> 47:05.680
Tyson's here to play.

47:07.680 --> 47:08.480
Where's the women?

47:08.480 --> 47:10.160
Bring them out, please, for Tyson.

47:10.160 --> 47:18.160
Tyson, just so I have this clear, is it T Y S S T I E.

47:20.080 --> 47:24.160
It's spelled like if you're like if it's spelled like ties,

47:24.160 --> 47:26.160
son, like you're telling your son about.

47:26.160 --> 47:26.960
Is it hyphen?

47:26.960 --> 47:28.000
It sounds hyphenated.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.400
No, it's just you put a little emphasis.

47:30.400 --> 47:36.640
There's like an umlaut on the second S. Tyson loves to party.

47:36.640 --> 47:37.520
He loves the women.

47:37.520 --> 47:38.480
That's all there is to it.

47:38.480 --> 47:41.200
That's him in a nutshell.

47:41.200 --> 47:46.160
You can't you can't change the direction of the wind and you can't stop Tyson from partying.

47:46.880 --> 47:49.600
That's the one thing about him that I do like.

47:51.120 --> 47:54.000
I don't like not I don't I don't like nothing about Tyson.

47:55.920 --> 48:00.400
The thing about Tyson, though, is that his tastes run a little expensive.

48:00.400 --> 48:09.520
Mm hmm. And as a result, we have to every once in a while take him to the money zone.

48:17.280 --> 48:19.280
You said that like we're taking him to show business.

48:20.480 --> 48:23.680
We are the one place you can't take Tyson.

48:23.680 --> 48:24.800
Get in the car.

48:24.800 --> 48:25.920
Tyson in the car.

48:25.920 --> 48:27.440
Put on this paper crown, Tyson.

48:27.440 --> 48:29.200
We're taking you to showbiz pizza.

48:29.200 --> 48:35.840
But hey, I'm really excited about this week because we are talking about cast of thrones.

48:35.840 --> 48:38.000
It's it's on iTunes.

48:38.000 --> 48:38.880
Search it right now.

48:38.880 --> 48:40.160
Cast of thrones.

48:40.160 --> 48:44.720
It is the top ranked unofficial Game of Thrones podcast on iTunes.

48:44.720 --> 48:45.760
It is spoiler free.

48:45.760 --> 48:47.680
It is very, very funny.

48:47.680 --> 48:52.160
It will help you make sense of Game of Thrones, which can get kind of confusing.

48:52.160 --> 48:56.240
They they talk to cast members, which is which is very cool.

48:56.240 --> 49:01.680
They've had some some high, high profile guests on there from the program, which I think is awesome.

49:02.800 --> 49:07.040
And as somebody who recently kind of got back into Game of Thrones after stop watching the

49:07.040 --> 49:11.680
series for a while and trying to hop back on, I found cast of thrones pretty invaluable.

49:12.480 --> 49:17.600
Now, what if I've never read or seen Game of Thrones and this might be the first time

49:17.600 --> 49:18.720
I've ever heard of it?

49:18.720 --> 49:20.080
Travis is this a podcast?

49:20.080 --> 49:23.440
Travis doesn't know a Lannister from a start from a Harry Potter.

49:23.440 --> 49:23.680
Right.

49:23.680 --> 49:24.240
That's true.

49:24.240 --> 49:27.520
But I would suggest that you download it right now,

49:28.880 --> 49:31.040
because it makes our marketing look more effective.

49:31.920 --> 49:34.800
And then you listen to it later when you watch the show.

49:34.800 --> 49:36.400
Also, why are you not watching the show?

49:36.400 --> 49:37.280
Read these books.

49:37.280 --> 49:38.960
It's made for you, Travis.

49:38.960 --> 49:40.080
It's made for you.

49:40.080 --> 49:40.960
What do you love, Travis?

49:40.960 --> 49:41.520
Do you love it?

49:41.520 --> 49:42.480
Do you love incest?

49:43.280 --> 49:44.240
Do you love dragons?

49:45.120 --> 49:47.040
I should not have started with incest.

49:48.240 --> 49:49.520
You like swordsmanship.

49:50.240 --> 49:52.240
Do you like it when brothers and sisters bang down?

49:52.240 --> 49:57.200
Don't ask about that on the air.

49:57.200 --> 49:57.760
We can talk about that after the show.

49:57.760 --> 50:01.520
What about when secret kings play dong slaps with each other?

50:02.240 --> 50:04.080
This is fucking classic Tyson.

50:05.120 --> 50:06.880
He has to make everybody so uncomfortable.

50:06.880 --> 50:08.320
There are also things that are in the show,

50:08.320 --> 50:10.160
so if you're not ready for the reality of secret kings-

50:10.160 --> 50:12.160
Can they talk about incest on cast of thrones?

50:13.120 --> 50:14.400
What else would they talk about?

50:15.840 --> 50:17.680
They can't talk around the incest.

50:18.400 --> 50:20.320
It's either that or they talk about the lighting on the show.

50:20.320 --> 50:21.680
Those are the two things.

50:21.680 --> 50:25.360
Sean Bean turned in a particularly thrilling performance,

50:25.360 --> 50:28.480
and also two kings just totally went to town on each other.

50:30.160 --> 50:32.240
Cast of thrones is on iTunes.

50:32.240 --> 50:33.120
You can search for it.

50:33.120 --> 50:33.840
You can go get it.

50:34.880 --> 50:36.720
And Griffin wrote this song about it.

50:37.360 --> 50:39.680
I'm going to try and do the actual theme song to the show.

50:39.680 --> 50:40.000
Really?

50:40.000 --> 50:47.680
Thrones cast, game of thrones cast.

50:47.680 --> 50:49.600
It's got incest.

50:51.680 --> 50:54.800
King sex, secret king sex.

50:55.440 --> 50:56.480
Dinklage town.

50:58.960 --> 51:02.320
Prostitutes, it's got prostitutes.

51:02.320 --> 51:03.760
40 prostitutes or so.

51:03.760 --> 51:11.680
There's fisting, there's sometimes fisting, cast of thrones.

51:13.280 --> 51:15.840
That was mostly just things that are on the show game of thrones.

51:17.440 --> 51:21.200
Peter Dinklage lives in Dinklage Town in the show.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.600
I'm sorry, did you say fisting?

51:23.600 --> 51:24.720
Did you say fisting?

51:24.720 --> 51:27.040
There's a very long and uncomfortable fisting scene.

51:27.920 --> 51:28.480
I don't want to give you-

51:28.480 --> 51:29.520
With Peter Dinklage?

51:31.360 --> 51:31.600
Yeah.

51:31.600 --> 51:34.480
Yeah, it's terrible.

51:34.480 --> 51:38.320
It looks like a deleted scene from the Muppets movie, Nightmare.

51:38.320 --> 51:39.520
Oh no!

51:41.760 --> 51:43.120
Cast of thrones on iTunes.

51:44.960 --> 51:50.160
I just graduated from college in the middle of the school year.

51:50.160 --> 51:53.600
I have a job lined up, but it does not start until July.

51:53.600 --> 51:56.800
Any tips on how I can spend this incredible amount of free time?

51:56.800 --> 52:01.600
I already read, write, and play video games, but I'm looking for some new jams.

52:01.600 --> 52:03.600
Justin's been talking about geocaching.

52:03.600 --> 52:04.800
What's the good word on that?

52:05.440 --> 52:06.880
Anyway, thanks for the help.

52:06.880 --> 52:09.200
That's from Bored Nightly in NYC.

52:09.200 --> 52:12.240
I feel like I can't stop talking about geocaching, but-

52:12.240 --> 52:13.600
Geocaching is the shit.

52:13.600 --> 52:14.080
Tell me-

52:14.080 --> 52:15.120
I got you guys on-

52:15.120 --> 52:16.480
Griffin's not on the tip yet.

52:17.360 --> 52:19.680
I'm sure there's lots of people doing it in Austin.

52:19.680 --> 52:24.880
Like if it's a weird thing that you can spend time on and not get paid for, like Austin's got it.

52:24.880 --> 52:25.380
Yeah.

52:27.120 --> 52:31.200
Within like 20 miles of me in Cincinnati, there's like 300 geocaches.

52:31.200 --> 52:34.240
So I bet there's like just millions in Austin.

52:34.240 --> 52:36.160
Did you find some choice caches, by the way, Travis?

52:36.160 --> 52:37.040
Did you find some good stuff?

52:37.040 --> 52:39.200
I found so many choice caches.

52:39.200 --> 52:43.680
I've explored so many parks and had more outdoor time in the last week than I've had in the last

52:43.680 --> 52:44.320
three years.

52:44.320 --> 52:48.320
I know, because you go to all these places that you would never expect to go to, or things that

52:48.320 --> 52:52.640
are in your neck of the woods, but you would have no reason to climb or explore.

52:52.640 --> 52:53.600
Geocaching's great.

52:53.600 --> 52:54.640
I would expect it-

52:54.640 --> 52:55.760
There's two different things.

52:55.760 --> 52:59.040
There's one where it's like, I'm going to go explore this park and go for a hike.

52:59.040 --> 53:02.960
There's two where it's like, oh, this is a parking lot I parked in a thousand times,

53:02.960 --> 53:05.680
and there was something hidden under my nose that I didn't know about.

53:06.480 --> 53:07.680
Those are super cool.

53:07.680 --> 53:08.400
I love those.

53:08.400 --> 53:13.600
There was something hidden in a guardrail, and you've driven past it 10 times, and there's

53:13.600 --> 53:14.720
been something there for 10 years.

53:16.720 --> 53:20.400
But you can totally do that in New York, I'm sure.

53:20.400 --> 53:23.120
There's some nice geocaching there.

53:23.120 --> 53:27.920
I made a poop the other day, and a geocache fell out.

53:29.600 --> 53:30.320
I was wondering-

53:30.320 --> 53:31.120
They're everywhere!

53:31.120 --> 53:34.320
I was wondering where you would be- when you would discover that one that I hid.

53:34.320 --> 53:35.360
But I'm glad-

53:35.360 --> 53:36.720
Did you sign the log and put it back?

53:38.800 --> 53:45.280
So yeah, geocaching is something you can do to sort of do some free time.

53:45.280 --> 53:47.040
You read, write, and play video games.

53:47.040 --> 53:54.080
That's pretty much my whole day, so I can't take you too much deeper than that.

53:54.080 --> 53:58.400
Maybe try to watch all the movies on AFI's best films list.

53:58.400 --> 53:58.960
You could do that.

54:00.160 --> 54:06.480
I suggest going to your favorite grocery store and buying some sort of food item and go home,

54:06.480 --> 54:13.520
get on allrecipes.com, search that food item, look up a recipe, I guess go back to the store,

54:13.520 --> 54:16.960
buy the other things that you need to make the recipe, and then before you know it, you're

54:16.960 --> 54:17.840
learning how to cook.

54:17.840 --> 54:18.560
That's how I did it.

54:18.560 --> 54:19.600
And then blog all about that.

54:19.600 --> 54:21.520
Blog about it, because God, I want to hear about it.

54:21.520 --> 54:22.480
Oh, you made crepes!

54:22.480 --> 54:22.800
Great!

54:23.360 --> 54:23.840
Great.

54:23.840 --> 54:24.480
Great Crepes.

54:25.200 --> 54:27.280
That's your website's name, greatcrepes.org.

54:27.280 --> 54:29.520
Greatcrepes.tumblr.com.

54:29.520 --> 54:29.840
Love it.

54:31.520 --> 54:35.360
In our culture, I think when you have a lot of free time, you're supposed to

54:35.360 --> 54:39.680
spend a year doing something that you wouldn't normally do, and then write a book about it.

54:40.560 --> 54:41.680
That seems to be the-

54:41.680 --> 54:42.880
Eat prey crepes.

54:42.880 --> 54:43.760
Eat prey crepes.

54:44.560 --> 54:46.960
Buy a sushi kit and start making your own sushi.

54:46.960 --> 54:49.040
You're wasting everyone's time not doing that.

54:49.680 --> 54:51.440
Yeah, learn to cook something you don't know.

54:52.400 --> 54:55.040
Yesterday, I made steak au poivre for the first time.

54:55.040 --> 54:55.600
It's delicious.

54:55.600 --> 54:57.680
It's steak in a brandy cream sauce.

54:57.680 --> 54:58.640
Yeah, sure.

54:58.640 --> 54:59.680
That sounds delicious.

54:59.680 --> 55:03.920
It's really good and easy, but I wouldn't have known how to do it if I hadn't just gone

55:03.920 --> 55:05.920
out there and just done it.

55:05.920 --> 55:09.680
And you could also set a goal like, over the next five months, I'm just going to master

55:09.680 --> 55:10.160
breakfast.

55:10.160 --> 55:10.400
Yeah.

55:10.400 --> 55:13.680
Over the next five months, I'm just going to masturbate.

55:13.680 --> 55:15.120
Every day, all day.

55:16.320 --> 55:18.480
You could also get obnoxiously into politics.

55:18.480 --> 55:19.280
Oh, don't do that.

55:19.280 --> 55:19.840
Oh, yeah.

55:19.840 --> 55:20.400
Don't do that.

55:20.400 --> 55:23.760
Just super get over your head in politics.

55:23.760 --> 55:25.760
What do we always tell people who listen to this show?

55:25.760 --> 55:28.240
Don't bother getting involved in politics because it's not going to change anything.

55:29.120 --> 55:29.360
Yeah.

55:29.360 --> 55:30.640
That's the number one thing.

55:30.640 --> 55:32.720
There's no benefit from being political.

55:32.720 --> 55:34.640
No one person has ever changed anything.

55:34.640 --> 55:39.360
Only 100,000 people working in unison, and nobody can do that anymore, so don't even

55:39.360 --> 55:41.360
bother.

55:41.360 --> 55:45.840
The only time it's happened in the past decade is Coney 2012, and the stress of it was so

55:45.840 --> 55:48.560
much that it made all the guys' clothes disappear.

55:48.560 --> 55:50.160
It made them run around checking off.

55:50.160 --> 55:51.600
That's how powerful that is.

55:51.600 --> 55:52.960
You don't want that hate.

55:52.960 --> 55:54.000
Just live your life.

55:54.640 --> 55:55.840
Try to stay under the radar.

55:55.840 --> 55:57.040
That's my whole thing now.

55:57.040 --> 55:58.000
I'm 31 years old.

55:58.560 --> 56:01.520
Let's just get through this one, and by this one, I mean your entire life.

56:02.080 --> 56:03.680
That's the best advice that we can give you.

56:03.680 --> 56:04.960
Try not to leave a paper trail.

56:04.960 --> 56:05.440
Yeah.

56:05.440 --> 56:06.480
Just keep it discreet.

56:06.480 --> 56:10.480
Just make it to the end of your life without dying, and you'll have succeeded.

56:10.480 --> 56:10.800
Yeah.

56:10.800 --> 56:10.960
Yeah.

56:11.520 --> 56:14.800
Get to the end of your life and just let it be like a puff of air that no one notices

56:14.800 --> 56:15.360
when you die.

56:15.360 --> 56:16.880
Just like, what'd that guy do?

56:16.880 --> 56:17.520
We're on nothing.

56:18.720 --> 56:20.320
At least you don't want to annoy everybody.

56:20.320 --> 56:20.960
Yeah.

56:20.960 --> 56:21.200
Yeah.

56:21.760 --> 56:22.960
Don't get in anybody's way.

56:23.680 --> 56:27.440
You gotta take up a craft.

56:28.240 --> 56:31.760
I think that's the best thing that you can do with your time when you're free time.

56:31.760 --> 56:35.200
If you don't want to feel like you've wasted your time, the only thing you can do is improve

56:35.200 --> 56:35.520
something.

56:35.520 --> 56:36.880
It's like the Sims.

56:36.880 --> 56:40.720
You play a guitar long enough, and then you can paint a beautiful painting, because it's

56:40.720 --> 56:41.680
both creativity.

56:42.800 --> 56:43.040
Right.

56:43.920 --> 56:45.520
That's video game logic for you.

56:45.520 --> 56:50.400
You know, our personal friend Brian Barth, when he found he had some free time on his

56:50.400 --> 56:51.760
hands, you know what he took up?

56:51.760 --> 56:53.040
Metallurgy.

56:53.040 --> 56:54.400
Learned how to forge shit.

56:55.840 --> 56:59.920
You laugh the first time, because who knows what they're doing with that.

56:59.920 --> 57:04.160
But now that he can do it full time, he can forge his own weapons.

57:04.160 --> 57:04.880
That's amazing.

57:04.880 --> 57:07.680
That's a great way to spend your free time.

57:07.680 --> 57:08.880
Yeah, it's super practical.

57:09.600 --> 57:12.400
On a different note, cross-stitching.

57:12.400 --> 57:13.360
You could cross-stitch.

57:14.080 --> 57:15.120
It's kind of like metallurgy.

57:15.120 --> 57:16.320
Did you say cross-tallurgy?

57:17.280 --> 57:18.240
Cross-tallurgy.

57:18.240 --> 57:19.200
Make metal crosses.

57:19.920 --> 57:20.800
Throw them at vampires.

57:21.920 --> 57:22.720
Don't cross-stitch.

57:22.720 --> 57:24.160
You could become a vampire, honey.

57:25.120 --> 57:25.600
Wait, hold on.

57:25.600 --> 57:26.400
Vampire honey.

57:26.400 --> 57:26.800
Did you?

57:27.600 --> 57:28.400
Aw, girl.

57:29.120 --> 57:31.120
Damn, those fangs are looking nice, girl.

57:31.120 --> 57:31.360
Come here.

57:31.360 --> 57:31.840
Let me see that.

57:31.840 --> 57:33.200
You have some juicy fangs.

57:33.200 --> 57:37.120
God, those fangs are juicy.

57:37.120 --> 57:44.640
No, you got to take up a trade that's going to be impressive to people, like magic.

57:44.640 --> 57:45.760
Like card tricks.

57:46.880 --> 57:47.440
Not the gathering.

57:47.440 --> 57:48.080
Magic cards?

57:48.080 --> 57:49.200
Magic cards, the gathering.

57:49.920 --> 57:50.320
Fucking do that, man.

57:50.320 --> 57:52.880
I had a bunch of free time, so I got good at magic.

57:52.880 --> 57:54.720
We got back from PAX last weekend.

57:54.720 --> 58:04.240
Those guys playing magic cards were getting more trim than Matthew McConaughey in 1996.

58:04.240 --> 58:05.440
1996 McConaughey.

58:06.240 --> 58:08.720
Like the peak of his parabola.

58:08.720 --> 58:09.280
Exactly.

58:09.840 --> 58:10.480
Hi, guys.

58:10.480 --> 58:11.840
It's just me, your dad.

58:11.840 --> 58:17.040
And well, I just wanted to share this special memory on this special podcast.

58:17.600 --> 58:22.800
I remember bouncing you kids on my knee, and now my knees are shot.

58:22.800 --> 58:24.640
So thanks a whole hell of a lot.

58:25.760 --> 58:26.720
Hello, brothers.

58:26.720 --> 58:32.000
This is Kathy from St. Louis, Missouri, calling to congratulate you on your 100th episode.

58:32.000 --> 58:37.840
Because of your weeding questions into wisdom, I now know how I feel about man-sized jars,

58:37.840 --> 58:42.560
how to place an order for stacum and tubes, how to take a big bite of the recovery sandwich,

58:42.560 --> 58:46.240
when to pack up and move away, and just how gross tropical killers are.

58:46.240 --> 58:48.800
I can't wait to hear the new and delightful nuggets of wisdom

58:48.800 --> 58:51.600
that you will provide in your next 100 episodes.

58:51.600 --> 58:53.360
Congrats.

58:53.360 --> 58:55.520
Uh, Trav, any other check-ins?

58:55.520 --> 58:56.640
Did we help anyone else?

58:56.640 --> 58:58.400
We got one that made me super happy.

58:59.040 --> 58:59.680
Hey, guys.

58:59.680 --> 59:04.240
Back on episode 67, I asked if there was any way to keep my mustache without people thinking

59:04.240 --> 59:05.200
I'm a creepster.

59:05.200 --> 59:07.840
I took your advice and went full Sam Elliott.

59:07.840 --> 59:11.520
Within a few weeks, I was elected to my college's homecoming court.

59:11.520 --> 59:12.160
Thanks, brothers.

59:12.160 --> 59:12.720
Fuck, yeah.

59:12.720 --> 59:13.440
Don't thank us.

59:13.440 --> 59:14.640
Thank irony.

59:14.640 --> 59:15.840
Thanks, irony.

59:15.840 --> 59:16.560
You're the best.

59:17.440 --> 59:19.040
And he attached a picture, too.

59:19.040 --> 59:20.800
It is a lovely mustache.

59:20.800 --> 59:21.760
How is it?

59:21.760 --> 59:22.640
What's the bushiness rating?

59:23.520 --> 59:25.120
I would say impenetrable.

59:25.120 --> 59:26.720
Trav, can you remember to put it in the forums?

59:26.720 --> 59:27.760
People can enjoy that.

59:28.560 --> 59:29.040
I will.

59:29.040 --> 59:30.160
I will attach that picture.

59:30.160 --> 59:31.600
I will make this guy famous.

59:31.600 --> 59:32.400
Okay, good.

59:32.400 --> 59:33.200
He deserves it with that mustache.

59:33.200 --> 59:34.560
Did he have any crumbs in there?

59:35.200 --> 59:35.840
Did he have like a-

59:35.840 --> 59:36.560
No, it was well grouped.

59:36.560 --> 59:38.080
Did he have like a full Cheez-It?

59:39.440 --> 59:42.880
He actually had a bird that traveled with him to help keep his mustache clean.

59:42.880 --> 59:44.640
That's the best thing I've ever heard.

59:44.640 --> 59:46.080
I want that now.

59:46.080 --> 59:47.360
Like one of those rhino birds.

59:48.880 --> 59:49.680
Sure.

59:49.680 --> 59:50.880
Guys, we knew what you were saying.

59:51.840 --> 59:53.680
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Lisa Holifield.

59:53.680 --> 59:54.400
Thank you, Lisa.

59:55.520 --> 59:59.680
It's by Yahoo Answers user China Doll who asks,

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:01.920
I need a hip hop group name.

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:02.560
Help me out.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:07.360
I need a group name, but it needs to end with girls with a Z.

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:09.840
It's the three of us.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:13.520
We need something cute that the teens and young girls can catch on to.

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.800
Nothing stupid, please.

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:16.800
Oh my God.

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:17.840
Fat cheesy butt girls.

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:18.480
Oh, that's-

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.720
The phrasing of the part where she says,

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:24.960
we need something the girls can catch on to makes me feel like

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:31.360
this is a few teachers that are going to lip sync a terrible song at the school talent show.

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.280
Or they're going to do a terrible song,

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:36.320
but like change the words to help promote teen abstinence.

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:38.080
That's what this feels like.

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:42.400
They're going to wear those sunglasses with the neon sides.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.000
You know, that classic style.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.280
Maybe some jams.

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:52.080
Guys, I've been sitting here trying to think of a parody of a modern song

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.360
in which to work abstinence themes into.

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:59.120
And the problem I'm having is that I can't think of a modern song.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:00:59.680
Oops.

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:02.720
I think the only song that popped in my head is Marry the Night.

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.880
And I think they're selling about like waiting until marriage.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.480
And I don't know what it is.

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:07.840
I can't remember if it was super bass.

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:10.960
I think that's the only song that's been released in the past five years that I've heard.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:12.800
It's a good one too.

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:16.320
That boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:17.120
Don't have sex.

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:21.360
I don't have sex and I know it.

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:22.240
That's one, right?

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:22.560
Yeah.

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.440
I don't have sex.

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:31.520
But maybe sort of look at the stars.

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.840
I am not having sex.

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:34.240
Sure.

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:36.320
If you're listening to Coldplay, it's assumed that you're not having sex.

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:36.720
Yellow.

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.640
The Coldplay girls would be a good name.

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:41.040
Sure.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.320
That would be a good name.

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.080
Because you've already got like the name recognition.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:44.320
Sure.

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:45.280
That's-

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:46.160
And copyright and-

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:46.640
No, no, no.

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:48.560
That's how- No, that's how naming the fans works.

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.000
Foo Fighters were originally called Beatles 2.

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:56.640
They're called Beatles Foo.

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:57.920
They're like, this is too long.

01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:58.400
This sucks.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.240
Everything about this is bad.

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:03.840
This bit sucks.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.120
Okay.

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:08.400
What about Chunky Girls?

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:09.040
Now hear me out.

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:11.600
Because they know how to move.

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:15.280
Here's what I'm going to do for the rest of this bit as we come up with names.

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:15.600
Okay.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:19.120
I'm going to double check and see if they're actual names.

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:20.080
Yeah, get on MySpace.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:21.840
First up, Chunky Girls.

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:22.880
With a Z.

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:25.040
Oh, with a Z.

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:25.920
It has to do with a Z.

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:26.640
Yeah, it's imperative.

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:28.160
First up, Chunky Girls with a Z.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.760
Okay, there is a chunkygirls.com.

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:32.880
Oh, don't click that.

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.560
Do not click that hyperlink.

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:35.440
Don't click it.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:39.040
It's too late.

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:43.440
And chunkygirls.com is also on MySpace, but it does not appear to be a band.

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:46.080
So Chunky Girls available.

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.600
So you could be Chunky Girls the band.

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.840
Yes, they could be Chunky Girls the band.

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:52.800
Can I read off the best answer as chosen by Asker?

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:53.760
Yes.

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.200
It's by Yahoo!

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:57.920
Insta user guda who says, it's kind of long.

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:02.720
I've played in bands, sang in bands, and written music for years.

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:07.040
Currently, I manage a group of local bands and singers, including Chainsaw Heart,

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:13.840
all girl metal, Silver Age Heroes, alt rock, Georgia Boy, with an I, rapper,

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:20.720
Terrified, all girl alternative, Red Sun alternative, Denied Metal, and My Pride of Joy,

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:22.960
a band of three young men by the name of Stolen Ink.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.000
Check them on Facebook.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.520
You won't be disappointed.

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:30.960
All these bands I named, and they have good solid names that are fun to say and easy to

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.960
remember, so please take to heart what I say next.

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:36.000
Misspelling a word and a group name never seems to work out well.

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:39.440
But if your heart is set on it, here's a few names tossed your way.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.400
Girls, girls, sorry.

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:44.720
Girls spelled normally.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.160
Girls spelled with a U.

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:48.160
Girls spelled with a Z.

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:49.920
So girls, girls, girls.

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:50.160
Yes.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.640
Name of your hometown.

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:53.120
Girls.

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:55.520
Monster beat girls.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.760
Nope, nope, nope.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:58.640
Beat girls.

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.240
No combination of beat girls.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:00.800
Yeah.

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.240
Should ever be in anything.

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:03.520
TXT girls.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.520
Text girls.

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:08.320
Power Supply girls and Rolling Rhythm girls.

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:13.360
I think Power Supply girls is my favorite.

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:14.720
Renewable Energy girls.

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:16.080
Oh, that's great.

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:16.720
Green girls.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:17.760
Wind Farm girls.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.360
Corn-based ethanol girls.

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:26.480
So, guys, it's time for our check-in of the Stolen Ink MySpace page.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:30.640
There are, of course, the trio of musicians from Bellevue, Illinois.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:33.600
Here are the literal names of the members of this band.

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:35.520
We got Lucas Holland on bass.

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:35.920
Okay.

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:36.160
Okay.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.600
Stone Seerlock on guitar and vocals.

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:46.880
And then my favorite, Kale Hug on drums.

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.960
Top comment on the MySpace page comes in from Adam.

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:54.480
He says, OMG, you guys rock.

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:57.440
If I were a chick, I'd do all of you.

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:01.680
JK, no, but really, I would.

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:02.880
And that was posted.

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:03.920
And that was posted when?

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:07.920
That came to us one year ago today.

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:09.680
I don't know if they consummated that.

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:11.440
It was a day just like today.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.440
I believe that means they have gone viral.

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:19.360
Then they changed their name to One Direction, and now they're huge.

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:20.240
Now we know them.

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:25.200
Adam, I have clicked a button to bring Stolen Ink to Honey Twice Virginia on the MySpace page.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.600
I don't know if that will work, but I have a-

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:28.480
Give me that ink.

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:29.840
I'm a fan.

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:31.200
Send it my way.

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:36.800
You know that you've, you know, you know you've got the Google heat

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:40.400
when the third result for searching for your brand brings up the headline

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:43.520
office depot manager got rich selling stolen ink cartons.

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:47.840
You know, you know you're making a dent in the scene.

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:57.200
Um, there is no band that you can put girls in that won't be miserable.

01:05:58.880 --> 01:05:59.840
Miserable girls.

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.640
That's probably the most accurate you're going to get, but

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:08.320
I don't think it has the penetration required to go viral.

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:09.600
Penetration girls.

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:12.160
You gotta stop saying the things I say and then girls after it.

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:14.960
Girls after it girls.

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:15.460
Stop it.

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:17.520
Stop it girls.

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:18.480
I'll hang you.

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:20.080
I will hang the life out of you.

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.040
Don't fucking, don't you fucking-

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:23.680
News girls.

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.880
Here's some, uh, here's some bands that have girls in the name.

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:29.200
Okay.

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:31.840
Uh, brought to you by our friends at allmusic.com.

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:32.880
They're Spice Girls.

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:33.280
Sure.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:36.400
Okay, uh, new girls in you.

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.040
So that's taken.

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:37.840
Oh yeah, I've heard of them.

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:40.400
Uh, 69 girls.

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:42.560
That's a large band.

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:45.360
It's like the polyphonic spree, but it's all, it's all ladies.

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:46.720
Yeah, yeah.

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:47.600
Girlsmen.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:49.440
No, they're bad.

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:52.240
Is this going, is there like 50 names down the list?

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:53.920
There's something hilarious.

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.000
You're hoping for a joke, right?

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:56.640
Where's the pay?

01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:57.680
I'm just waiting for the payoff.

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:58.080
It's cool.

01:06:58.640 --> 01:06:59.680
We've done this a hundred times.

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:00.960
I know you know what you're doing.

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:02.880
Um, can you just edit it?

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.720
Can you put a payoff in post?

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:14.960
Can you, how about, can I come up with a gag later and I'll just fax it to you?

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:19.840
Or I can just, I'll just type it into Microsoft Sam and I'll just put that in later.

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.120
Thanks.

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:25.040
So here's another check-in email.

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:31.440
Um, I am potential runaway bride from episode 31 who you gave some very serious relationship

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:36.080
advice to regarding a boyfriend who wanted to propose when I was terrified of the idea.

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:40.400
In short, you told me to consider why I was so scared and leave him if it wasn't working.

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:41.040
I did.

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:44.880
And then I left and I can honestly say it was one of the best things I've ever done.

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:48.320
With him out of my life, I graduated college early, moved to a new city,

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:50.720
and am in a wonderful relationship with a new guy.

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:53.040
Thank you for giving me a dose of reality, brothers.

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:55.920
Packed my bags and moved away from Charlotte, North Carolina.

01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:00.080
This is, listen, I, this is fantastic.

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.200
This, this really does.

01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:05.840
It warms my heart and I feel so happy for you, but I genuinely hope that the guy that

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:08.160
you were dating originally wasn't like General Zaroff.

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:11.840
It was going to very slowly hunt me, Justin, and Travis all down for making you break up

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:12.340
with him.

01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:16.500
Also, I just want you to know like what a huge risk you took.

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:17.300
Yeah, yeah.

01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:18.100
Oh man.

01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:19.380
Acting on our advice.

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:21.780
I'm so glad it worked out well.

01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:25.220
We sound serious when we're saying these things.

01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:26.820
It still doesn't mean we mean them.

01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:29.780
You can't, you can't actually do the stuff.

01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:32.180
I can't have that hanging over my head.

01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:37.060
I'm, I'm just terrified of like, it's great that this worked out for you, but I'm terrified

01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:40.580
of like the six people that weren't able to write in because they're homeless now and

01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:43.860
can't afford the computer to tell us the terrible things that we did to their life.

01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:48.260
You have to remember, we've answered an average of six questions over a hundred episodes.

01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:49.060
That's six hundred.

01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:52.580
Forty people or so wrote in.

01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:55.780
So to me, that means five hundred and sixty people are just dead.

01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:57.620
Just dead as fuck.

01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:00.020
Dead because of our words.

01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:02.500
Yeah, we killed them with our show.

01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:03.780
So for that, we're sorry.

01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:08.420
What if we get a question in next week that's like, hey brothers, I was going to propose

01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:11.540
this girl, but she done, she done dipped on me.

01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:13.620
So now I'm pretty much sad all the time.

01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:15.060
What do I do?

01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:16.660
Now I just sit around listening to miserable girls.

01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:18.500
What do I do to stave off the loneliness?

01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:21.940
Love, David.

01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:25.380
Love, I'm right behind you with a knife.

01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:27.460
Yeah, I'm going to kill you.

01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:32.660
I'm moving to Cincinnati this weekend for my first grownup job and my first time living

01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:33.380
alone.

01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:38.260
I am in desperate need of tips for making the move go slowly.

01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:39.940
I've got plenty of family helping.

01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:40.580
Smoothly.

01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:43.220
I want the move to be as slow as possible.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:44.820
Can I ride on a giant tortoise?

01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:49.460
What's the slowest car that there is to buy?

01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:56.660
I got plenty of family helping, but I'd like the experience to suck as little as possible.

01:09:56.660 --> 01:10:01.380
I'm appalled with the number of books and video games I've accumulated over the years.

01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:03.140
Thanks, Brothers Gmail.

01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:07.380
All right, I'm going to tell you something straight up and it may be too late for this.

01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:15.060
I have never ever gotten rid of a physical possession and then regretted it ever in my

01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:15.860
entire life.

01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:16.900
I completely agree.

01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:23.860
I have never gotten rid of a DVD or a game or whatever and wished later that I had that

01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:25.780
thing again.

01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:26.180
You know what?

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:30.500
I'll take that one step further because I'm a huge pack rat or I was a huge pack rat.

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:36.340
And over the course of like four years from like age 24 to like now, I've moved like eight

01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:41.140
times and in moving into this apartment that I'm currently in, I finally went through and

01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:46.580
unpacked all the boxes that I hadn't touched in like five moves and they were full of just

01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:52.020
literal garbage, like pieces of paper, scraps of things that I just thrown into a box rather

01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:53.460
than like sorting through my shit.

01:10:54.260 --> 01:11:00.100
And I probably would have moved eight last boxes move if I just actually gone through

01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:01.140
and sorted through my stuff.

01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:03.300
In your defense, you are half borrower, though.

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:04.340
Yeah, that is true.

01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:05.300
That's disgusting.

01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:07.140
It's disgusting and half magpie.

01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:07.700
Disgusting.

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:10.900
Here's what you do.

01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:13.060
You throw away probably well, don't throw it away.

01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:16.900
Go to Goodwill, drop off like half your clothes because I guarantee you don't wear half of

01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:17.460
your clothes.

01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:18.020
Just get rid of them.

01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:18.660
They take up space.

01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:19.140
They're heavy.

01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:19.620
They're gross.

01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:20.580
They're moldy.

01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:21.380
Get rid of those.

01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:23.540
Get rid of old shitty furniture.

01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:26.260
It's time for you to upgrade, get some nicer stuff.

01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:28.660
I wouldn't get rid of any video games because I can't.

01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:33.380
I got rid of all of my Super Nintendo and PlayStation games once so I could buy a computer

01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:37.780
and I regret it every day of my life that I don't have my original copy of Chrono Trigger

01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:38.980
on the Super Nintendo.

01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:40.180
That's got sentimental value.

01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:42.980
I'd hold on to those because you're going to want to come back to your-

01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:45.460
Yeah, I mean, yeah, that's like a box to put your video game.

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:47.140
That's not like a big deal.

01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:47.860
And here's another thing.

01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:54.020
If you're willing to invest a little bit of money, go and buy uniform boxes, especially

01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:55.300
if you're like packing a truck.

01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:58.580
Having uniform boxes make it so much faster.

01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:00.340
Especially if you have a lot of uniforms.

01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:02.180
Those are going to come in super handy.

01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:06.180
I mean, like same size, same shape, same construction.

01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:07.060
You're absolutely right.

01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:09.860
Seal the bottom.

01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:11.060
Tape up the bottom of the box.

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:11.700
Tape up the bottom.

01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:15.460
Don't do that thing where you fold over the four corners.

01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:18.260
It always, you're going to drop your books on your foot and you're going to be mad.

01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:24.500
Also, if you got a bunch of family and friends helping you, you have to remember that like

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:28.820
your efforts in the move are important, but you got to keep an eye on people that they

01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:30.580
don't start trying to do stuff.

01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:33.220
Like, you know, all you want them for is manual labor.

01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:36.020
If you see people trying to get shifty and start unpacking things.

01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:39.780
I just put your pots and pans under the sink.

01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:40.340
Oh, great.

01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:41.300
Where it's super dirty.

01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:42.500
That's great.

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:43.780
That's where I wanted those.

01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:44.420
That's where I hate them.

01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:45.220
I hate them there.

01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:46.020
Thank you.

01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:47.060
Great job.

01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:47.540
Keep it up.

01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:54.580
Also, I highly recommend doing furniture first and like when you move it into your new apartment,

01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:58.100
furniture first, then carry all the boxes and everything because the furniture is the

01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:00.900
big heavy upfront, you know, push.

01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:04.020
And then you can take one box at a time and it's less of a stress.

01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:08.420
But if you wear yourself up on boxes and then you get to the furniture, you're going to

01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:11.860
be so sad that you and listen, don't let people leave.

01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:13.220
They're going to try to sneak out.

01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:14.260
You can't let that happen.

01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:16.420
You've got to keep an eye on people.

01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:17.300
They're going to run.

01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:20.260
They're going to try to bolt because everybody hates moving and they hate helping you.

01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:23.060
Oh, guys, I'm moving.

01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:28.100
I'm moving in like a month or two and I'm just reading this question and us talking

01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:31.460
about it, I'm having like a panic attack.

01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:36.900
The thing is, moving is once you're all moved in and you've set up your new apartment,

01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:38.260
it's like the greatest thing.

01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:43.940
But the lead up to it, like cleaning out your three years of terribleness in your apartment,

01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:45.460
it's like the worst.

01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:50.500
And you can try to clean your stuff, like you can try to remove the signs of your life.

01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:56.980
If it tastes like, why does it take so many passes to like remove the evidence of your

01:13:56.980 --> 01:13:57.540
existence?

01:13:57.540 --> 01:13:58.980
It takes forever.

01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:03.460
And the worst part is like, you look around at your stuff, right?

01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:05.860
Right now, everybody stop, take a look around where they are.

01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:07.780
You think, I don't have that much stuff.

01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:10.820
A couple of books on the bookshelf, you know, some stuff.

01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:13.060
You have so much shit.

01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:14.420
Like you don't even know it.

01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:16.580
It's under bookcases and inside drawers.

01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:17.780
You have so much stuff.

01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:20.020
Terrible.

01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:27.700
Comedian and hospitality expert Amy Sedaris, she had a pretty good way of doing this.

01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:32.900
She would invite people over for garage sales and basically she would just lay out a bunch

01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:37.780
of stuff that she owned on tables in her house and you would give her a quarter for anything.

01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:40.100
And you would just go through her house buying her stuff.

01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:42.820
She would just sell it to you because you would came over for garage sale party.

01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:47.940
Can I just use this podcast as like my own personal Austin Craigslist?

01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:51.780
Like guys, I've got like two laptops I just don't use.

01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:52.660
I need to hawk them.

01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:54.820
I've got a bed that I'm probably going to need to get rid of.

01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:55.780
Just like hit me up.

01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:59.620
I'll give you very reasonable prices and you can sleep in the bed of a star.

01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:03.620
A rich man.

01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:04.500
This is a celebrity bed.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.980
You can roll around in my skin flakes and you'll love it.

01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:08.340
Love every second of it.

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:08.980
Dirty boy.

01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:10.340
Now you're never going to sell a bed.

01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:10.980
So dirty.

01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:13.700
Such a dirty bad bed.

01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:14.420
It's got my cheek.

01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:18.820
It's got, oh God, go on.

01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:19.620
Good job.

01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:20.740
I'm talking guys.

01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:22.740
100.

01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:25.220
Holy shit guys.

01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:31.780
I have been listening since episode one and you're about to hit your hundredth episode

01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:33.140
and that's fucking awesome.

01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:35.140
And I've listened to every single one.

01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:36.580
You've answered one of my questions.

01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:38.420
You give me shout outs on the show.

01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:45.940
I drank fucking a strawberry tropic chillers because of you guys and it was the worst thing

01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:49.540
that I've ever done, but I'm, I'm glad that I did it.

01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:54.420
I've grown as a person and I couldn't have done that without my brother, my brother and

01:15:54.420 --> 01:16:01.140
me, uh, congratulations on your hundredth episode from, uh, Ian Johnson in Kansas city,

01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:01.700
Missouri.

01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:03.620
Guys, I got a Yahoo answer from Steve Lewis.

01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:04.660
Thank you, Steve.

01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:05.460
I should be clear.

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:09.540
I should be clear, Steve didn't ask it because I don't think this is Steve style, but he

01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:09.940
sent it in.

01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:10.820
Thank you, Steve Lewis.

01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:17.300
It's by Yahoo answers user question mark who asks my boyfriend has a teeth fetish.

01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:21.140
My boyfriend has a teeth fetish.

01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:22.740
Maybe it's a cavity fetish.

01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:27.300
He always wants, he always wants to look inside my mouth at feelings I've had done or any

01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:27.860
dental work.

01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:30.740
He likes to feel my teeth with his tongue while we're kissing.

01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:34.580
And he's even, he's even asked if he could see copies of my dental x-rays.

01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:35.780
I care about him.

01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:38.660
And this is the only persistent problem between us.

01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:42.180
So I'd really like to find a way to work around this, but it makes me uncomfortable.

01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:46.260
He is constantly asking me questions about my dental history and wanting to look inside

01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:46.820
my mouth.

01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:50.260
And he has made it clear that it's a sexual thing and he's turned on by it.

01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:53.700
I'm not really sure how to handle this because I've never really dealt with anything like

01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:54.260
this before.

01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:55.220
Any help?

01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:57.940
I'd like educated responses only please.

01:16:57.940 --> 01:16:59.220
I understand this is a strange question.

01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:00.260
I'm aware it's highly ordinary.

01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:04.260
No need for anyone to use the response system to blast their personal feelings preferences

01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:04.900
on this topic.

01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:05.460
It's weird.

01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:06.100
I get it.

01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:08.420
Dear Yahoo.

01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:10.580
I have like the greatest boyfriend.

01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:12.740
There's this one little thing.

01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:13.060
One ish.

01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:14.420
I've got one ish with him.

01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:20.740
I now know that time travel will not be invented in my lifetime because there's no way future

01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:25.380
Justin would not have come and snatched the headphones from me just then and said, no,

01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:26.500
don't do this.

01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:27.060
Don't do this.

01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:28.020
You can't live with-

01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:29.380
Don't go down this rabbit hole.

01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:31.940
Can't carry this burden with you of knowing this is a thing.

01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:37.940
Can we- the one thing that is bad about the internet except for all the other things is

01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:42.500
the one major thing is I don't need to just do this in your own home.

01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:43.860
I don't need to know about it.

01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:48.420
Why would you foist this onto the public consciousness?

01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:57.700
Listen, did you not assume any hole that is on or can be made with the human body is-

01:17:57.700 --> 01:18:00.020
People have a fetish over that, right?

01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:05.540
I just didn't assume that it would get so tiny as cavities, you know what I mean?

01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:11.780
I'm just glad that this- because I was sure there was going to be some ambiguity to this,

01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:14.900
but thank God that the boyfriend cleared up that it is a sexual thing.

01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:19.380
Hey, just real quick, just so there's no confusion, don't let me be misunderstood.

01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:20.660
Got to see those cavities.

01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:24.260
This is not at all- I don't care about your dental hygiene.

01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:26.420
I'm not like studying to be a dentist or anything.

01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:28.740
I am boned out for your canines.

01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:29.940
I'm boned out for your canines.

01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:30.660
Please get them out.

01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:31.860
This is really hot to me.

01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:33.780
So here's my question to you guys.

01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:39.940
When in this guy's younger years, did he have the best dentist ever or the worst dentist ever?

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:45.060
So he had one of those that has turned him into this.

01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:47.780
So I just need to clear up which one he had.

01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:51.780
You mean like he gave him the gas and was like very comforting to him and like gave

01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:54.980
him a free toothbrush with every visit or-

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:59.860
Yeah, or he would just blasting Slayer from all the speakers and ripping his teeth out

01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:01.140
without Novocaine.

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:03.780
One of them is triggering this.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:09.780
I'm just- I'm trying to decide what the question asker wants to accomplish.

01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:15.620
Like is this person asking how do I become okay with the fact that my boyfriend is a teeth guy?

01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:20.100
She's trying to do a pro and con scale, right?

01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:24.820
And she knows all the pros and she's figured out the value of them.

01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:31.140
She needs to know the metric weight of how terrible it is that he wants to fuck her teeth out.

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:33.140
Oh, very.

01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:33.780
Very hot.

01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:37.940
I would say 2,000 pounds is how heavy this is.

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:40.900
A metric, it's a solid ton of bad.

01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:47.140
Guys, all she's doing is she wants to share her burden.

01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:47.700
That's it.

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:48.820
That's all this is about.

01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:50.900
Hey, take a load off, question mark.

01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:52.420
Take a load off, yahoo.

01:19:52.420 --> 01:20:00.500
Take a load freak and tell me about your boyfriend's thing with teeth.

01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:03.460
Pulled into internet.

01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:06.900
Gotta tell people about my freaky boyfriend.

01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:10.740
He likes to jerk off to people's smiles.

01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:15.700
His favorite member of the Muppets was Dr. Teeth.

01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:21.460
He's got 20 pairs of dentures in the closet.

01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:23.460
He calls it his secret shrine.

01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:26.260
You're turning into Randy Newman again.

01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:27.220
And everybody knows.

01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:31.220
Gives me a cavity search and it means exactly what it sounds like.

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:33.300
Take a load off, yahoo.

01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:36.820
Tell me about the thing with teeth.

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:39.220
Oh, fuck.

01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:40.820
Can we not?

01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:42.260
Can we please not?

01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:43.780
What's next?

01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:44.180
Can we just not?

01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:45.780
Is this, this is the end game, right?

01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:47.380
What small, I guess, pores?

01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:52.820
Every time I hear one of these things, I expect there to be, like,

01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:55.540
curtains on the computer that close.

01:20:55.540 --> 01:20:57.460
It's like, the end.

01:20:57.460 --> 01:20:58.180
The end.

01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:00.900
The internet theme.

01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:04.900
Hey, thanks for sticking with us this far, Justin.

01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:06.340
You've reached the end of the internet.

01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:07.460
We've had a good run.

01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:09.140
Here's a printout certificate.

01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:12.100
Turns out we were all ghosts the whole time.

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:14.180
Thanks for hanging in there for a decade.

01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:16.740
Uh, thanks for sticking with us through the prodigy years.

01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:19.060
We know things were a little rough in the beginning.

01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:23.700
This whole thing has been a Truman Show-esque television extravaganza.

01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:27.460
People watching you explore the horrifying depths of the internet.

01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:32.260
Most of it was user generated content by people who are delighting in your torment.

01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:33.700
You've won eight Emmys.

01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:37.220
You're the most famous person in the world.

01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:39.940
Uh, it's all for you, Justin.

01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:42.980
Because that's what people, that's what people on the internet need to think that they are,

01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:46.340
in fact, even more important than they already assume that they are.

01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:48.820
Oh man, teeth, guys.

01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:51.940
You know the horrifying thing is that this girl-

01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:53.700
Yeah, I know the horrifying thing, Travis.

01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:57.780
No, but there's like, there's like a whole group of people that are like,

01:21:57.780 --> 01:21:59.620
yeah, that's completely normal.

01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:00.100
Yeah.

01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:01.380
Teeth. Sexy. Sexy teeth.

01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:02.500
That's actually the first answer.

01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:04.580
So it's weird, so what?

01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:06.420
We all have our own little ways of getting turned on.

01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:09.380
Yes, perhaps your boyfriend's is a little further out from the mainstream than most,

01:22:09.380 --> 01:22:10.980
but if you love him, should not matter.

01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:15.060
Like, I don't, and this is where, this is where I, I agree.

01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:15.780
Doesn't matter.

01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:20.100
I'm, we are all three of us super in, I think we proved last week,

01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:23.300
we're both into and knowledgeable about the kink scene.

01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:25.700
We're down, we're down with all that.

01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:29.460
Whatever you want to do, just don't tell anybody about it.

01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:33.060
Right, like, I'm in the sexual waffle irons,

01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:36.580
but like, I would never ever say that out loud in front of another person,

01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:38.180
let alone an enraptured radio audience.

01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:39.460
Yeah, and like, I can't stop walruses.

01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:42.740
I can't stop walruses. Yeah, Travis is like, stuck on walrusing.

01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:44.420
And I like sex.

01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:45.860
But you know, I keep that to myself.

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:54.500
I like, I like, um, I like sex all, sex, weird sex.

01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:55.380
That's gross, Justin.

01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:56.580
That's horrible.

01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:57.140
You pervert.

01:22:57.140 --> 01:23:00.260
I was just talking about putting your penis in a waffle iron,

01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:02.660
or some, maybe a sandwich maker, make a paninas.

01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:09.940
Wait, I'm sorry, did you say paninas?

01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:15.220
And the Oscar for podcasting goes to Griffin McElroy for paninas.

01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:19.540
The worst word that now exists.

01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:23.540
And the worst image, in case anyone is wondering.

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:27.700
The 100% worst thing that is, and you're crushed, toasted dick.

01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:31.220
I actually went, I went to the, uh, I went to Panera Bread the other day,

01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:33.380
and they had a paninas on special.

01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:35.700
Oh no.

01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:37.460
Okay.

01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:37.700
Okay.

01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:41.300
Well, between your paninas and, uh, your delicious, juicy butt.

01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:42.260
I have a lot to offer.

01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:43.460
This is the worst day ever.

01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:45.060
You got a lot going for you.

01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:48.340
This is what happens when we record a two-hour podcast.

01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:51.380
Usually when we record a one-hour podcast, we get to like, minute 53,

01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:54.740
and we have to pull the ripcord, because something awful has happened.

01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:57.380
We've learned something awful about ourselves in the internet.

01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:59.220
This time we have, we have no such luxury.

01:23:59.220 --> 01:24:00.580
Yeah.

01:24:00.580 --> 01:24:02.020
We're just getting as deep as it.

01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:03.700
We're just figuring this out.

01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:04.580
How deep this goes.

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:08.980
Uh, we're, we're making callbacks in this episode of things that happened so long ago.

01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:11.700
We don't, we no longer remember them.

01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:16.820
You know, I, it's a little off topic, uh, of the podcast, but I find that,

01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:21.380
I think that this might be a time to answer some behind the scenes questions

01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:26.580
that we've been asked over the years of just stuff like, uh, how much editing.

01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:27.140
So much.

01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:28.660
None.

01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:29.940
You guys would not believe.

01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:32.660
Well, Justin and I don't do it.

01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:33.300
Yeah.

01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:36.020
They, approximately zero minutes from both of them.

01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:37.620
Well, Justin does it every once in a while.

01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:39.700
Griffin, what kind of editing do you do in the show?

01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:44.180
The kind where when we say things that aren't funny, I just, I can delete that.

01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:46.820
And how much, how many deleted scenes did you say that is?

01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:47.540
Half of it.

01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:48.100
Half of them.

01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:49.220
Half of them.

01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:51.300
50%.

01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:53.140
One out of every two.

01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:56.260
How many, how many, what percentage of that is funny,

01:24:56.260 --> 01:24:59.300
but you would never want anyone to know that we said the things.

01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:00.500
So you have to delete them.

01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:01.860
What percentage is that?

01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:04.900
So the, so the, the, the bigoted material.

01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:05.380
Yes.

01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:08.500
The more, let's say the more bigoted material.

01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:11.620
Um, all, all, 100%.

01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:12.420
Pretty much all.

01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:13.300
It's all funny.

01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:17.620
It's just some of it is like the kind of funny that Don Rickles can get away with

01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:18.980
because he'll be dead soon.

01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:19.860
That's kind of funny.

01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:25.300
Once we're 70, we'll release the, the master tapes and people will-

01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:27.380
By which we do mean, in fact, the master tapes.

01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:32.500
They are, they're master tapes for the master race is the name of that, uh, collection.

01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:33.780
No, it's not called that.

01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:34.260
It is.

01:25:34.260 --> 01:25:35.540
We'll, it will be called that.

01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:37.780
But there'll be quotes around it.

01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:41.060
And then we'll be at the bottom like, get it?

01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:42.260
We're old now.

01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:43.380
We're old.

01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:44.100
This is cool.

01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:45.220
Travis, do we have any more?

01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:47.780
Do we have any more behind the scenes questions?

01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:50.420
Was that, was that literally the only thing people don't understand about?

01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:54.820
Um, we also get asked stuff like how we pick where we do the live shows.

01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:56.100
Fucking no.

01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:57.780
Where does one of us live?

01:25:57.780 --> 01:25:58.020
Yeah.

01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:02.100
The most convenient place.

01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:05.060
If we could do one in our living room, that's what we would do.

01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:06.900
We have plans to do other ones now.

01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:07.140
Yeah.

01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:07.620
The places we'd like-

01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:08.900
Now that we're super rich.

01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:11.540
Now that we're super rich, the places we'd like to do live shows.

01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:14.260
Well, I think New York is an obvious one.

01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:14.500
Yeah.

01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:14.740
Yeah.

01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:17.220
We, we would love to do one there.

01:26:17.220 --> 01:26:21.540
We would, we're doing one in LA for, but that'll be like part of the max fun con.

01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:24.420
So we'd love to do one in Seattle.

01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:25.860
Yeah, that'd be a lot of fun.

01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:26.580
And Boston.

01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:28.020
Boston.

01:26:28.020 --> 01:26:29.700
I'd love to do one in Philadelphia.

01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:32.260
In conjunction with PAX East sometime.

01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:33.380
You know, I've been thinking about it.

01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:39.380
If you, if you work for a venue or if you are part of an organization that brings people in

01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:44.900
and you would like for us to come and do a show, let us know, you know, invite us.

01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:46.100
We'll see what we can do.

01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:47.620
DC, we'd like to do one there.

01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:49.700
But anyway, that's it.

01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:51.700
I mean, those are the places that we'd like to do them.

01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:54.740
It's just, logistics can be a challenge.

01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:57.380
Maybe a European tour.

01:26:57.380 --> 01:27:00.580
I think, I think the, the Europeans been waiting long enough.

01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:02.100
The, we would love to do that.

01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:07.140
If you guys can figure out how we, we can make that, like we can pay for it.

01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:11.460
If you, if our European friends would be willing to do a Kickstarter with us.

01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:13.460
Don't say don't, but don't just start one.

01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:16.340
Don't just start one because we need the money, not you.

01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:22.100
But if you guys want us to do a Kickstarter where the end game is that we go to Europe

01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:25.380
and I don't know, maybe you donate enough money.

01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:28.820
You can like, well, I'll have like a VIP champagne room or something.

01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:31.300
Oh, I, where we jerk them off?

01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:38.180
No, no, jerk them off with, with comedy, with our mouths.

01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:39.780
We jerk them off with our mouths.

01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:40.420
We'll giggle bait them.

01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:41.380
Oh Justin, no.

01:27:41.380 --> 01:27:43.940
That's called another thing.

01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:46.420
No, I, I mean.

01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:49.220
That's what it's called when you mouth off to somebody.

01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:50.100
That's actually what it is.

01:27:52.180 --> 01:27:53.780
I just really want to go to Europe.

01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:57.700
If I got to blow a guy, whatever.

01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:02.580
It worked for, it worked for Maggie Gyllenhaal and Cherry, baby.

01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:04.580
She got the thing like most of her life that way.

01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:05.620
I just want to do it once.

01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:07.380
Like, I don't think that's asking so much.

01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:09.540
It's asking quite a bit.

01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:10.820
It is asking quite a bit.

01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:13.540
So here's another question we get asked a lot that I want to go ahead and knock out now.

01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:17.380
So we don't go through another hundred episodes of getting this question once a week.

01:28:18.340 --> 01:28:21.300
People always ask, they're thinking about starting a podcast.

01:28:22.180 --> 01:28:23.460
Do we have any advice?

01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:27.700
Do we have how to make it funny, how to do it, anything along those lines?

01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:30.180
What if your podcast gets more popular than ours?

01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:31.140
Where does that leave us?

01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:32.500
That's why we don't ever answer it.

01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:33.380
Honest to God.

01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:34.180
Yeah.

01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:36.340
Because there should only be one podcast in this world.

01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:37.300
That's not ours.

01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:37.940
That's not it.

01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:39.940
Hey, stop podcast yourself.

01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:40.500
Do that.

01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:42.820
You're out of the game.

01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:47.300
Jordan and Jesse go, Jordan and Jesse stop, get out, out of the pool.

01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:51.380
Throwing shade, throw some dirt on your grave because you're done podcasting.

01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:51.860
You're out.

01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:55.700
Former Judge John Haught, disgraced Judge John Haught.

01:28:56.660 --> 01:29:00.820
The verdict is in and you have to stop with your show because we're the only ones left.

01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:02.340
What else we got?

01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:04.740
WTF, where to find podcasts?

01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:06.740
It's nowhere because you're stopped.

01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:08.260
How did this get stopped?

01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:09.300
How did this get stopped?

01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:10.100
That's pretty good.

01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:17.220
I guess the advice would be have two really funny brothers to carry your dead weight for you.

01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:19.220
That's been my plan for two years.

01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:20.260
It's been working out great so far.

01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:21.540
Wait, that's what I've been doing.

01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:22.100
Shit.

01:29:24.100 --> 01:29:25.220
I got you guys.

01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:27.860
I got this.

01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:34.500
I would say the best advice that I have for anyone is don't just start doing a podcast

01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:40.340
because you feel like it, like wait until you find a good topic and a good cast of people.

01:29:40.340 --> 01:29:40.900
That's what we did.

01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:44.420
Yeah, but like we didn't say like, let's do a podcast and start one the next day.

01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:45.860
Like we brainstormed and worked on it.

01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:46.900
That's exactly what we did.

01:29:46.900 --> 01:29:49.060
We workshopped it for like 35 minutes.

01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:50.660
Yeah, and all that was coming up with the name.

01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:52.660
Yeah.

01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:53.700
What was our, do we-

01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:56.180
Oh God, I have a text document somewhere with some of the failed names.

01:29:56.180 --> 01:29:56.980
Can we do that?

01:29:56.980 --> 01:29:57.780
Can you read that?

01:29:57.780 --> 01:29:59.300
Do you have that somewhere saved?

01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:01.620
Travis can read a check in while you look for it.

01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:03.940
In fact, Travis, do it.

01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:05.060
Got it.

01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:10.340
Last summer, I asked for tips and tricks for safely navigating one's first music festival.

01:30:10.340 --> 01:30:14.820
In reply, you guys warned me against getting hit by mysterious buses as well as avoiding

01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:16.820
the dangers of prostatitis.

01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:20.020
I'm happy to report that my trip to Bonnaroo was a rousing success.

01:30:20.020 --> 01:30:24.900
I maintained a healthy fear of parked buses and RVs while simultaneously keeping my butthole

01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:25.700
game correct.

01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:30.260
This year, I will be returning to Bonnaroo and this time I will be breaking the rules

01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:32.420
and this time I will be bringing friends.

01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:35.540
Congrats on the 100th episode, Battleworn at Bonnaroo.

01:30:36.340 --> 01:30:37.460
Now Travis, you giggled.

01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:40.020
I like the phrase butthole game.

01:30:41.620 --> 01:30:42.900
It's so vital though.

01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:44.740
That's no joke.

01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:45.380
Yeah.

01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:48.660
You want to come home, you'd be like, yeah, I saw Wilco, it was great, got a butt disease.

01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:52.580
Travis, another one from this, vegetarians.

01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:53.620
Oh, okay.

01:30:53.620 --> 01:31:00.020
Here's another one, I asked you what I should do to feed my vegetarian friends in episode

01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:00.820
46.

01:31:00.820 --> 01:31:03.380
Somehow I managed to feed them and remain friends with them.

01:31:03.380 --> 01:31:08.180
I even managed to pick up more of those delusional friends and am currently dating one.

01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:10.100
So I guess everything worked out well.

01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:12.980
Thanks and congratulations on the 100th episode.

01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:16.100
So congratulations on your vegetarian girlfriend.

01:31:16.660 --> 01:31:18.580
You guys, I found the document.

01:31:18.580 --> 01:31:18.820
Okay.

01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:26.260
Here's some a few names that we came up with that were really bad.

01:31:26.260 --> 01:31:28.900
Bad, brother in my ear.

01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:34.340
We got into robots for a while.

01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:36.180
Travis said fat robot.

01:31:37.940 --> 01:31:39.460
Not quite human.

01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:41.300
Justin said the not quite human fan cast.

01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:47.300
This is all legit by the way.

01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:48.180
This is not a bit.

01:31:48.980 --> 01:31:52.820
Brother attack, wind brothers attack, heat of the bromant.

01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:56.260
Heat of the bromant was such a good, wait, wait, what was it?

01:31:56.260 --> 01:31:57.780
Heat of the bromant.

01:31:57.780 --> 01:31:58.420
That was mine.

01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:02.180
Blossom.

01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:13.620
Blossom, it's just blossom?

01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:14.500
That's just blossom.

01:32:15.140 --> 01:32:16.500
Family circus.

01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:21.380
Oh man, some of these are so fucking bad.

01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:23.700
Keep going.

01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:24.980
I have to know.

01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:25.780
Oh, this is great.

01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:26.500
Macklejoy.

01:32:31.220 --> 01:32:33.460
I was the first one to suggest my brother, my brother and me.

01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:34.900
I forgot that piece of errata.

01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:38.980
And then right after that, I suggested Keenan and Kel and Justin and Travis and Griffin.

01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:42.100
Let's see.

01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:48.900
I remember we had a honorary brother was, was one that we kicked around, brother bought

01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:51.860
5,000, I think was one brother bought 5,000.

01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:53.700
I do remember bro.

01:32:53.700 --> 01:32:55.380
Cirque du bro, Cirque du Brolet.

01:32:55.380 --> 01:33:01.140
I remember a bro, your own way was one that was very close to becoming it.

01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:10.340
The Baldwin's podcasting podcasting, the Baldwin brothers podcast with your host,

01:33:10.340 --> 01:33:19.460
the Mackleroy brothers, brother, I think maybe, and you know, how people who really love Mr.

01:33:19.460 --> 01:33:25.860
Belvedere, Colin Brock tune, I think that we should maybe, maybe people who are super

01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:30.020
fans of the show should pick one of these as a nickname they can, they can use for.

01:33:30.020 --> 01:33:30.820
Oh, I like that.

01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:35.380
That only they use that only they use, but while still, let's go with Blossom.

01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:39.380
Just please make it blossom, but don't check out the latest episode of Blossom.

01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:42.180
Well, we're actually trying to, we're still trying to build our brand heat.

01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:43.220
So please don't do that.

01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:48.500
Let's include the hashtag, the NBA hashtag we do because like, we're just really trying

01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:50.100
to get, build this brand right now.

01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:53.220
How about a Yahoo answer?

01:33:53.220 --> 01:33:53.780
Yeah, sure.

01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:56.660
Are we still doing this fucking bot?

01:33:56.660 --> 01:33:58.740
Are we doing like two shows in a row or something?

01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:01.060
Yeah, we're going to squeeze in two hours.

01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:01.620
Oh my God.

01:34:01.620 --> 01:34:03.620
People, it's what people want in.

01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:04.980
They've listened to 99 hours.

01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:07.380
I only want two more because they're fucking insane.

01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:09.540
This one is sent by Mark Turetsky. Thanks, Mark.

01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:14.500
It's by Yahoo Answers user Andre who asks 2012 into the world safe places to hide.

01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:21.620
I'm not going to read his whole question because it's like six paragraphs of the craziest thing

01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:28.020
I've ever read, but he had a friend who used to work at Area 51, told him it's a government

01:34:28.020 --> 01:34:29.940
bunker about 1500 miles underground.

01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:35.220
He said that in 2012, there will be quote a new beginning that the government knows

01:34:35.220 --> 01:34:38.660
all about. It's going to kill 99.9% of the people on the earth.

01:34:38.660 --> 01:34:45.140
They're going to save Obama and Bush and Clinton and him, his buddy who works at Area 51, NASA

01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:45.780
for some reason.

01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:49.140
And it's a no fly zone.

01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:50.660
When do you get to the crazy part?

01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:56.180
When I said 2012 into the world safe places to hide.

01:34:56.900 --> 01:34:58.180
No, but all of that's true.

01:34:58.180 --> 01:34:59.380
Right from the kickoff.

01:34:59.380 --> 01:35:01.940
No, I saw all of that on the history channel yesterday.

01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:03.220
Here's a problem.

01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:03.940
No, you didn't.

01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:04.420
Yes, it is.

01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:06.740
Here's another. Here's a second problem.

01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:09.220
He can't enter this facility.

01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:10.820
It's it's limited entry.

01:35:11.700 --> 01:35:15.060
He wants to move to the Himalayas, but he's not a mountain climber, but he doesn't know

01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:18.820
of any other safe places to hide when the depletion of the human race happens.

01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:20.100
Well, I think the answer is obvious.

01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:23.780
Is it Area 52?

01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:27.220
It's not.

01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:29.300
It's kind of shoddily made.

01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:32.260
Area 52 is the name of the pizza parlor next door.

01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:34.420
It's hilarious.

01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:35.300
Hilarious gag.

01:35:36.340 --> 01:35:38.340
What if you can you stand in a doorway?

01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:41.780
Can you get can you get in your bathtub?

01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:43.620
Get in your bathtub in a doorway.

01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:45.780
Build a doorway in the bathtub in the basement.

01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:47.780
That's the safest place you can be in any emergency.

01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:51.780
That's a you a bomb can go off next to you and you'll be you'll be okay.

01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:52.280
Yeah.

01:35:54.420 --> 01:35:57.620
That's how that's how Osama survives for so long.

01:35:57.620 --> 01:36:02.420
He actually wouldn't leave the the the door frame in the bathtub in a basement.

01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:08.100
They had to carry him around like a like a giant sedan with the guys on the side.

01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:09.780
Ah, fuck.

01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:12.180
I should have said Area Club 54.

01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:13.780
Stop it.

01:36:13.780 --> 01:36:14.580
Damn it.

01:36:14.580 --> 01:36:16.580
That would have led to like a whole string of goofs.

01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:18.100
Oh, yeah, it would have been really great.

01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:19.220
I would have been really good.

01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:19.700
Well, never.

01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:23.140
Maybe if you want to start a podcast, there's a great way.

01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:25.540
Just take that goof that Travis left there by the right side.

01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:28.020
That's I'd say it's a full podcast with a group.

01:36:28.020 --> 01:36:29.380
It's a rich vein of goose.

01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:30.660
It's a rich goose vein.

01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:32.740
Oh, no claim jumpers.

01:36:33.940 --> 01:36:37.140
So claim jumpers would be a great name for a podcast.

01:36:37.140 --> 01:36:38.500
Can we change ours?

01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:39.380
No, no.

01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:42.980
Travis, listen, I appreciate all the goofs.

01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:46.500
We are eight months out from the apocalypse.

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:51.060
So like if we could come up with something, something, maybe a submarine.

01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:53.540
It depends on what goes on, right?

01:36:53.540 --> 01:36:54.340
Yeah, we don't know.

01:36:54.340 --> 01:36:56.740
The problem with that's the thing, you got to plan for all.

01:36:57.380 --> 01:36:59.300
You get in a submarine and go under and you're like,

01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:00.580
ha ha ha suckers.

01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:02.420
And then what's this tidal wave?

01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:03.220
You're caught in the wave.

01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:04.500
You're thrown into a building.

01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:07.540
But of course, like if Galactus comes and just eats the planet, it's like,

01:37:07.540 --> 01:37:10.260
well, I wish I hadn't wasted so much time getting ready for this.

01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:13.460
Well, maybe that's why they're taking that's why they're taking NASA with them.

01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:16.420
Because they're working on that the spaceship.

01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:20.900
But then what if it's like a just like a wave, like a solar flare that destroys the planet?

01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:25.380
And then the only people will be safe are the people in bathtubs and doorways and basements.

01:37:25.380 --> 01:37:27.060
So just free floating in space.

01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:29.300
Guys.

01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:33.860
I wish I hadn't taken my clothes off.

01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:34.820
I never thought this.

01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:37.540
My pee pee's out in space.

01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:41.300
Can I look at your mouth?

01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:43.220
Um, we're all fucked.

01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:44.500
Yeah, it's over.

01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:47.540
So I was trying to enjoy ourselves while we got time.

01:37:47.540 --> 01:37:50.100
I haven't seen Melancholia, but I watched a few trailers.

01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:51.300
Yeah.

01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:57.140
That's how you choose to spend your 2012 experiences watching trailers for Melancholia.

01:37:57.940 --> 01:38:00.260
The sad thing about the world ending in 2012

01:38:00.260 --> 01:38:03.060
is that no one will ever get to hear the master race master tapes.

01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:04.260
Yeah.

01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:06.980
Guys, I know I'm actually thinking about it.

01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:08.260
What if it does happen?

01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:11.220
It's not going to happen, but if it does go, then it's inevitable.

01:38:11.220 --> 01:38:14.980
You know, no sense in worrying about it unless it's going to.

01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:17.220
Here's what's going to happen is people are going to be like,

01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:21.380
like when that day comes, what is it, the 20th, December 20th, 2012, right before Christmas.

01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:22.820
Five days before Christmas.

01:38:22.820 --> 01:38:23.620
Yeah, I know.

01:38:23.620 --> 01:38:24.500
So it's going to happen.

01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:26.020
I'm not doing any shopping, by the way.

01:38:26.020 --> 01:38:26.580
Sorry.

01:38:26.580 --> 01:38:27.460
Fuck all y'all.

01:38:27.460 --> 01:38:29.940
There's going to be a lot of last minute Amazon in from the kid.

01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:34.820
Do you remember when June 6th, 2006 came along and people were like,

01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:36.660
oh fuck, here it comes.

01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:38.580
666 everyone's dead.

01:38:40.580 --> 01:38:45.220
And everyone bought into it so much that there was just rioting in the streets and like people

01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:49.780
burning down entire cities and just like people lost their minds until June 7th came around.

01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:54.100
It's going to be like that, like people are going to bring it about out of their own,

01:38:54.100 --> 01:38:55.300
out of their own fear of it.

01:38:57.060 --> 01:38:58.420
See, Justin's kicking it off early.

01:38:58.980 --> 01:39:00.260
I got melancholia over here.

01:39:01.060 --> 01:39:03.620
Hey brothers, congrats on that hundo.

01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:05.940
Hey guys, this is Franz Ferdinand.

01:39:07.220 --> 01:39:13.460
Just calling to say, you know, my, my death sparked World War, World War One.

01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:18.500
So you can take this to the bank when I let you guys know that you're, you're just tops.

01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:22.100
And I really think you kids are going to make it anyway.

01:39:22.100 --> 01:39:27.540
I'm in hell because I was never baptized, so I got to get off the phone, but keep up

01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:28.340
the good work.

01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:35.460
I have this theory that if we go full, like we're entering the third hour of podcasting

01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:40.020
that we have, that we're in our third hour of it, which is going to sound hilarious.

01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:43.780
People listening and then it's been on for 45 minutes.

01:39:43.780 --> 01:39:47.300
Hey, wow, Griffin really does clip a lot of this show out.

01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:49.300
This is really heavily edited.

01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:53.140
I think it's appropriate that we end talking about the end of the world.

01:39:54.020 --> 01:39:57.860
Yeah, I think if we keep going, it would just be clicks, right?

01:39:57.860 --> 01:40:02.420
It would just be a bunch of clicks and noises that don't even resemble speech anymore.

01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:09.540
If we continue to podcast on into that infinite night, should we keep podcasting until the

01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:10.260
end of the world?

01:40:10.900 --> 01:40:11.860
That's my question.

01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:14.260
We've only got eight months left.

01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:17.220
Shouldn't we dig in and just keep podcasting the whole time?

01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:19.780
Let's do one.

01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:20.980
Let's do one more.

01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:21.780
Definitely.

01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:22.260
Definitely.

01:40:22.260 --> 01:40:23.220
You can't stop me.

01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:24.580
This one was sent in by Lisa Holofield.

01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:28.660
Thank you, Lisa Holofield, for your, your constant, your unswerving patronage.

01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:34.580
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Clayton, who asks, can I call my husband daddy?

01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:38.500
Good night, folks.

01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:39.860
Do we really want to do this?

01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:41.300
Goodbye, everybody.

01:40:41.300 --> 01:40:43.220
Tell me right now, should we do another one?

01:40:45.860 --> 01:40:48.100
Let me give you some, let me preview out the other ones.

01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:50.820
How to make a, how to make a best friend.

01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:51.540
Okay.

01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:52.180
Could be sad.

01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:53.780
I don't, I'm not, I don't want like-

01:40:53.780 --> 01:40:57.060
Why would a girl, why would a girl send another girl a boobs emoticon?

01:40:57.060 --> 01:41:02.740
Uh-huh, don't you think Justin Bieber is turning ugly day by day and losing all his fans?

01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:07.700
All right, let's, let's explore that.

01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:09.220
It was also sent in by Lisa Holofield.

01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:09.700
What do you know?

01:41:10.340 --> 01:41:11.220
Yeah, who answers you?

01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:14.420
Deepak Chaiton, who asks, don't you think Justin Bieber is turning

01:41:14.420 --> 01:41:15.940
ugly day by day and losing all his fans?

01:41:15.940 --> 01:41:18.740
After so many years of ruling the music industry.

01:41:18.740 --> 01:41:21.380
Basically, basically King Beebs.

01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:26.820
I think he is turning a bit not attractive and he's losing his fans.

01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:29.220
Due to the Robert Pattinson and One Direction.

01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:32.420
Only Beliebers answer and say the truth.

01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:35.940
No false prophets.

01:41:35.940 --> 01:41:39.300
I'm a, I'm a Belieber agnostic right now.

01:41:39.300 --> 01:41:42.500
I, I'm not sure that I am fully in the Beebs camp.

01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:47.460
I'm going to try to find the most recent picture of the Beebs that I can.

01:41:47.460 --> 01:41:48.420
Oh, it's awful.

01:41:48.420 --> 01:41:50.020
He looks like Donald Sutherland.

01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:58.180
Somewhere there's a portrait of him getting more and more attractive.

01:41:59.140 --> 01:42:01.780
And Donald Sutherland's like, I can walk without the cane today.

01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:02.820
I'm feeling really good.

01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:03.860
Yeah.

01:42:03.860 --> 01:42:05.700
Thanks, man.

01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:08.020
If he's listening, I just really took the wind out of his sails.

01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:11.460
If Kiefer's listening, I'm a fucking dead man.

01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:14.020
Oh, the Beebs.

01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:15.380
How old is he now?

01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:17.540
He was born in 2008.

01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:22.820
So he was manufactured by government scientists in 2008.

01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:23.780
He's 12.

01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:27.220
Hey guys, is it time for everybody to lay off at Justin Bieber yet?

01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:28.500
Can we give him a break?

01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:33.380
Once you saw Never Say Never, I don't think there's anybody.

01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:36.100
I think you meant to say once you saw Never Say Never.

01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:38.100
I thought I made a film recommendation to you guys.

01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:41.620
Dude, do you not remember when I said, hey, you guys should watch this movie?

01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:43.060
And you said, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's on Netflix.

01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:44.340
We'll watch it tomorrow.

01:42:44.340 --> 01:42:45.460
I don't remember saying that.

01:42:45.460 --> 01:42:47.620
I remember you saying you should watch it.

01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:49.540
And I don't remember us saying anything legally binding.

01:42:49.540 --> 01:42:52.100
You emphatically, emphatically agreed.

01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:56.100
I'm having sort of a problem right now.

01:42:56.100 --> 01:43:01.620
And that is that I went to Justin Bieber's Wikipedia page, and he was born in 1994.

01:43:01.620 --> 01:43:05.860
And there's a section on the Wikipedia page labeled childhood and youth.

01:43:05.860 --> 01:43:15.380
And it's like all, all of it, please tell me, still current, current to now, still youth.

01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:16.740
He's still childhood and youth.

01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:23.700
If the Bieber's youth is behind him, I am a decrepit old, I'm like the Crip Keeper right now.

01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:26.020
I can't even keep my limbs on.

01:43:26.020 --> 01:43:27.380
It's like death becomes her.

01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:31.220
Like shit's falling off my body if the Bieber's youth is behind him.

01:43:31.220 --> 01:43:34.340
Yeah, but now that he's legal, it's like, ew, gross.

01:43:34.340 --> 01:43:35.220
Gross, right.

01:43:35.220 --> 01:43:43.140
Well, I think youth technically ends when you like fuck a 35 year old woman in,

01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:45.540
during your tour in Germany.

01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:47.700
Like it doesn't matter if you're 13 years old.

01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:49.300
Did that happen?

01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:50.180
Come on.

01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:51.220
Okay, you're right.

01:43:51.220 --> 01:43:52.980
I don't follow the blogs.

01:43:52.980 --> 01:43:55.380
What are those new directions kids into?

01:43:55.380 --> 01:43:56.260
One Direction?

01:43:56.260 --> 01:43:58.980
I don't understand how female attraction works.

01:43:58.980 --> 01:43:59.480
Okay.

01:44:00.260 --> 01:44:01.620
I was just sitting here thinking about it.

01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:09.620
But it's unthinkable to me that there are people who looked at Justin Bieber and were like,

01:44:10.900 --> 01:44:14.420
he's fucking got it going on handsomeness sexy wise.

01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:23.220
You know, Griff, I bet a lot of that is like that he is possibly the least threatening person

01:44:23.220 --> 01:44:25.300
to have ever existed in the world ever.

01:44:26.020 --> 01:44:26.520
Yeah.

01:44:26.900 --> 01:44:29.060
You're just saying that because you've never seen Never Say Never.

01:44:29.060 --> 01:44:31.700
You don't know how hard he is.

01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:36.020
And saying stuff like that just completely undermines your case, Griffin.

01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:41.540
When he plays basketball with his friends back in Canada, because he is Canadian.

01:44:41.540 --> 01:44:42.040
Right.

01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:44.660
When he's playing Canadian basketball-

01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:46.500
And writing songs about how he beat Shaq.

01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:52.900
When he's writing songs about the party that he threw at his house that he got grounded for

01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:56.900
and his older brother Nick is like just killing it in 98 degrees.

01:44:56.900 --> 01:44:58.180
Is that what the band he was in?

01:44:58.180 --> 01:45:00.900
Yes. Which one died? LFO.

01:45:02.100 --> 01:45:04.100
All of LFO died?

01:45:04.100 --> 01:45:09.140
Not all of LFO, but the only one you'd recognize on the street.

01:45:09.140 --> 01:45:09.640
F.

01:45:10.580 --> 01:45:11.700
F died.

01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:14.660
I love girls that wear black. It's please. It's a funeral.

01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:18.500
Was that LFO?

01:45:18.500 --> 01:45:20.580
Yeah. I love girls wear...

01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:24.740
Guys, Justin Bieber is done.

01:45:24.740 --> 01:45:27.860
I was just thinking about it, did some Google image searching, he's done.

01:45:27.860 --> 01:45:29.780
He's fucking, he's gross.

01:45:29.780 --> 01:45:31.300
Don't make me look at him anymore.

01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:33.140
You're over it? Over the babes?

01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:34.580
He's got crow's feet.

01:45:34.580 --> 01:45:35.060
It does he?

01:45:35.060 --> 01:45:36.260
Who needs that?

01:45:36.260 --> 01:45:38.500
Well, he's been a necklace made of crow's feet.

01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:41.380
He's been under a lot of stress.

01:45:41.380 --> 01:45:43.140
He's like the most famous person.

01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:45.700
Do you know how hard that is to deal with?

01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:50.660
I hear during his latest concert when he did Somebody to Love and then like the tour manager

01:45:50.660 --> 01:45:53.860
goes out in the audience and brings a girl up on the stage to be his special someone

01:45:53.860 --> 01:45:57.540
and he like gives her the rose and like dances around her like he does at every concert.

01:45:57.540 --> 01:45:59.620
I heard the last concert that he did that out.

01:45:59.620 --> 01:46:02.980
He gave the girl the rose and she was like, no.

01:46:04.180 --> 01:46:06.820
And she threw it back in his face and it poked one of his eyes out.

01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:08.180
And now he has one eye.

01:46:09.300 --> 01:46:12.660
And he's a lot less attractive because he looks like he's always winking.

01:46:13.380 --> 01:46:14.100
Hey.

01:46:14.100 --> 01:46:16.260
Justin Bieber, here's a question for you.

01:46:16.260 --> 01:46:19.780
Does Bieber have to die young?

01:46:19.780 --> 01:46:26.260
Now, hear me out if Bieber Bieber can't do anything for the rest of his life.

01:46:26.260 --> 01:46:31.060
That is not exactly this like by the very virtue that Bieber will age.

01:46:31.860 --> 01:46:35.540
He can no longer be Bieber as we have come to think of him.

01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:41.060
Does sure is the right plan of attack for a him to like disappear for five years and

01:46:41.060 --> 01:46:44.340
then come back hard like five o'clock shadow.

01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:49.140
So, you know, I've been through some stuff, maybe some light cursing on his album.

01:46:50.260 --> 01:46:57.780
Is that is that like he needs to like pupate for a while and enter a beautiful chrysalis

01:46:57.780 --> 01:47:00.660
and come out Justin Timberlake, start up his acting career, maybe.

01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:02.660
Yeah, that's where this terminate.

01:47:02.660 --> 01:47:07.860
I would also like to propose a witness relocation program for aging child stars

01:47:08.820 --> 01:47:11.620
and like change his name, become a substitute teacher in Utah.

01:47:11.620 --> 01:47:12.980
Mm hmm.

01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:14.980
Hi, I'm I'm your teacher, Jorsten Blaber.

01:47:16.020 --> 01:47:17.860
Today, we're going to talk about social studies.

01:47:17.860 --> 01:47:19.860
I'm going to bring one of you girls like a 10 year old girl.

01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:24.900
I'm going to bring one of you girls up from here to make you my special someone.

01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:28.180
And you have to give your oral report on Custer's last stand.

01:47:28.180 --> 01:47:28.500
Get it.

01:47:30.740 --> 01:47:31.380
Are we done?

01:47:32.180 --> 01:47:32.980
I hope so.

01:47:32.980 --> 01:47:35.780
I can't say anything else 20 minutes ago.

01:47:35.780 --> 01:47:40.340
Yeah, I don't know any other things to say except to say thank you guys.

01:47:40.340 --> 01:47:46.500
Thank you guys so much for hanging out with us like through all these years and two years,

01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:47.780
I guess not all these years.

01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:52.420
It was like some years, but all these both years, all these both years you guys have been here

01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:55.460
and you've been listening to us talk about utter nonsense.

01:47:55.460 --> 01:47:58.580
And please don't get on Twitter like this episode was whack.

01:47:58.580 --> 01:48:02.340
I don't know if we were aware.

01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:02.980
We're aware.

01:48:02.980 --> 01:48:04.580
Like we talked for two hours.

01:48:04.580 --> 01:48:07.940
Like at some point, this just becomes like hanging.

01:48:07.940 --> 01:48:11.220
We're just hanging.

01:48:11.220 --> 01:48:15.380
We did this to prove a point so that you guys wouldn't ask for extra long episodes anymore.

01:48:16.180 --> 01:48:17.460
This is an object lesson.

01:48:17.460 --> 01:48:21.060
This is a tough love episode of my brother and me.

01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:22.260
Do you think we enjoyed this?

01:48:22.260 --> 01:48:22.900
We didn't.

01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:23.300
Did not.

01:48:23.300 --> 01:48:23.620
We did.

01:48:23.620 --> 01:48:24.900
We did it because we love you.

01:48:24.900 --> 01:48:25.700
Yep.

01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:28.580
We're trying to teach you a lesson that you'll never forget.

01:48:28.580 --> 01:48:29.780
I'm actually sleepy.

01:48:29.780 --> 01:48:33.380
I'm like, yeah, you're like all your goof energy has been depleted.

01:48:33.380 --> 01:48:35.220
You need to go have a hamburger and just chill out.

01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:39.300
Get a protein shake and just beer Pilates.

01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:41.220
Head to the cool off tent.

01:48:43.540 --> 01:48:44.420
Drink some OJ.

01:48:45.780 --> 01:48:47.060
Put my head between my knees.

01:48:47.060 --> 01:48:48.740
Just like find my center again.

01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:53.620
Guys, I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters for the use of our theme song.

01:48:53.620 --> 01:48:55.620
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

01:48:56.260 --> 01:49:00.500
They just announced on the Max Funcon lineup that he's going to be doing a panel.

01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:02.340
I believe at Max Funcon, which I am.

01:49:02.340 --> 01:49:04.980
He's doing a panel and I'm doing a panic attack as a result.

01:49:04.980 --> 01:49:05.540
Like I can't.

01:49:05.540 --> 01:49:06.100
Yeah.

01:49:06.100 --> 01:49:06.900
Can I handle it?

01:49:07.780 --> 01:49:12.420
I know it's been six days since we mentioned it, but I also wanted to say if you haven't

01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:15.860
yet, if you haven't stopped this stupid podcast, go check it out.

01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:17.220
Go check out the cast of Thrones.

01:49:18.100 --> 01:49:19.300
They were sponsored this week.

01:49:19.300 --> 01:49:21.620
You probably forgotten about it, but they're awesome.

01:49:21.620 --> 01:49:23.620
Well, they're good to go listen to them.

01:49:23.620 --> 01:49:25.460
Thank you to everybody tweeting about the show.

01:49:25.460 --> 01:49:35.860
Nor Rockwell, Gali Ayali, of course, as always, Christian Nobano, Joanna Eleven, Action Allen,

01:49:35.860 --> 01:49:41.860
Kambo Soup, Jerez1985, Law and Order PCP.

01:49:43.220 --> 01:49:47.700
Thank you guys so much for all your support over these two years.

01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:52.180
And the only reason people are listening to the show is because you, you know, you're

01:49:52.180 --> 01:49:57.060
the only reason people are listening to the show is because you told other people about

01:49:57.060 --> 01:49:57.220
it.

01:49:57.220 --> 01:50:03.140
So please don't stop that as we go into our third year and our second hundred episodes.

01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:08.260
We can actually, because we are brothers, can never stop doing this podcast.

01:50:08.260 --> 01:50:12.820
So as long as people keep listening to it, that would be ideal because we really can't

01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:13.620
stop.

01:50:13.620 --> 01:50:13.860
Yeah.

01:50:14.420 --> 01:50:20.980
Thank you to Jesse and all of our family members at Maximum Fun.

01:50:20.980 --> 01:50:24.100
It's it's it's an honor to be a part of this.

01:50:25.060 --> 01:50:30.340
It seriously that was joining this network was a I think that's the best thing that happened

01:50:30.340 --> 01:50:32.580
to us in the last hundred episodes.

01:50:32.580 --> 01:50:32.820
Yeah.

01:50:32.820 --> 01:50:36.580
Or or the last, you know, 30 years of all of our lives.

01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:43.700
Thank you to our dad for teaching us, making us born, taking us about Chuckles at a young

01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:43.860
age.

01:50:43.860 --> 01:50:46.660
He was a stern taskmaster when it came to goofs.

01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:49.780
And the one thing he told us to never do was to record for more than two hours.

01:50:49.780 --> 01:50:54.660
And yet here you so much to our dad for allowing us to spring forth from his loins.

01:50:55.620 --> 01:50:59.940
It is a complicated and fully grown, fully grown.

01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:00.340
I can't.

01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:04.340
Is this that's that's pretty gross.

01:51:04.340 --> 01:51:05.620
I'm so sleepy here.

01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:07.780
I just want the show to be over.

01:51:07.780 --> 01:51:09.700
Griffin, you're the only one with power to make it stop.

01:51:09.700 --> 01:51:10.900
Please thank everybody.

01:51:10.900 --> 01:51:11.460
Thank you.

01:51:11.460 --> 01:51:12.580
Thank you so much, guys.

01:51:12.580 --> 01:51:13.540
Seriously.

01:51:13.540 --> 01:51:14.740
And thank you for all that money.

01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:16.580
I just don't know what you do.

01:51:16.580 --> 01:51:17.940
It's sweet, sweet money.

01:51:17.940 --> 01:51:19.220
God, I'm so rich.

01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:19.620
Griffin.

01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:20.500
I bought a Taco Bell.

01:51:21.060 --> 01:51:22.420
I bought a Taco Bell restaurant.

01:51:22.420 --> 01:51:23.300
I bought a taco.

01:51:24.260 --> 01:51:26.820
So our split may be off.

01:51:26.820 --> 01:51:28.580
This one is sent in by Lisa Holifield.

01:51:28.580 --> 01:51:29.780
Thank you, Lisa Holifield.

01:51:29.780 --> 01:51:30.500
Very, very much.

01:51:31.060 --> 01:51:34.660
You our shows would be like half as long without without your questions.

01:51:34.660 --> 01:51:34.980
Thank you.

01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:38.580
It's by Yahoo Answers user Amelia H who asks.

01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:48.660

Keep your heart, three stacks, keep your heart, hey, keep your heart, three stacks, keep your heart.

01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:12.900
Man, these girls are smart, three stacks, these girls are smart.
