WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.660 --> 00:49.660
It's better it's better

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
It's better it's better

01:00.260 --> 01:02.260
Better it's better

01:11.060 --> 01:12.260
Hello

01:12.260 --> 01:18.740
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

01:18.740 --> 01:25.560
I'm your middlest brother Travis big dog with whoof McElroy, and I'm your sweet baby brother

01:26.420 --> 01:29.380
Griffin snubbed at the Emmys once again McElroy

01:31.140 --> 01:36.220
This was my this was my year with my show for Fred

01:36.220 --> 01:41.380
Jasso, yeah. Yeah, how is Fred Jasso handling the loss?

01:42.060 --> 01:44.060
Fred Jasso is pretty sad

01:44.260 --> 01:50.520
My boy dates and could a kiss is pretty hard torn up about it because he had a he had a star turn

01:50.780 --> 01:52.900
Yeah as Fred Jasso

01:52.900 --> 01:56.540
I'm gonna tell you the thing it's most is pointing Griffin if I'm a yeah

01:56.980 --> 02:02.700
Fred Jasso came out two months before that other one and nobody's talking about it. It's bullshit

02:02.700 --> 02:10.100
It's bullshit because we don't have maybe maybe maybe Dapes and Cadaceus doesn't have an SNL

02:10.340 --> 02:14.420
Career to fall back on like, you know that he can point to and be like, I got the chops

02:14.420 --> 02:20.460
You know what? I mean? I'm like some other I mean, he's a college improv. It was pretty good. He did some college improv

02:20.460 --> 02:26.520
It was mostly religious based. He was the sort of star of the BYU improv circuit

02:26.520 --> 02:32.960
I know that you had a bit you wanted to do Travis and I'm so here for it

02:32.960 --> 02:33.280
Okay

02:33.280 --> 02:33.520
Yeah

02:33.520 --> 02:36.920
You guys know and I this would be the kind of thing that we would talk about if

02:36.960 --> 02:40.600
Ted lasso was like a show that everybody was watching or nobody was watching

02:41.840 --> 02:45.200
Sort of in a weird middle ground, but nobody's talking about Ted lasso

02:45.640 --> 02:51.920
Did you guys know there's a conspiracy theory that the guy who plays Roy Kent is CGI? I do know about this. Yeah

02:53.160 --> 02:54.880
No

02:54.880 --> 03:01.760
He just look he he looks unbelievable. Yeah, he's incredible. I love Brett Goldstein. So here's the thing you got

03:01.760 --> 03:04.940
Can I tell you the problem? Yeah, yeah reporting my brother my brother and me

03:05.440 --> 03:09.800
Cuz sometimes people are like you guys don't do enough questions anymore. And you know what? Okay

03:09.800 --> 03:15.160
Yeah, I put together a list this week and there's some really just absolute bangers in there, but then also

03:16.160 --> 03:20.560
Like grimace is a tastebud and like that's really kind of hard

03:20.560 --> 03:25.600
Isn't it? Yeah, can I tell you so hard? Here's the wild thing about it?

03:25.600 --> 03:28.440
I looked it up. Do you guys know the story behind this you guys hear about this?

03:30.080 --> 03:32.600
Travis you you legally, you know, you're

03:34.560 --> 03:36.080
Thank you

03:36.080 --> 03:41.320
Thank you. So here's okay. Here's the best part about it, right? Everybody's talking about the fact that grimace is a taste

03:41.320 --> 03:44.900
But that's not the best part about it. Nobody's talking about Ted lasso fuck Ted lasso

03:44.900 --> 03:50.300
No grimace is a taste but so this came from this guy Brian Bates

03:50.660 --> 03:53.540
Who is being honored as outstanding manager of the year?

03:54.540 --> 04:01.900
just a manager of one of the branches of McDonald's or whatever and the interviewer asked him like what he's grimace and Bates just

04:01.900 --> 04:08.620
Went rogue and went an enormous taste bud. Okay, but wait, hold on what he shouldn't be allowed to

04:09.180 --> 04:13.500
You shouldn't be allowed to do that. What I mean, it's a manager of the year

04:13.500 --> 04:21.020
It's true. I get that but you don't get creative rights for the front. You don't get to rest recruit the the sort of

04:22.260 --> 04:25.900
CCO wheel just because you did a good job running a McDonald's

04:25.900 --> 04:30.180
But I'll tell you that's what gets Bates to be the manager of the year that take charge attitude

04:30.180 --> 04:35.940
What's like what is grimacing? It's like well if no one's gonna decide I'll decide right now buck stops here. He's a taste bud

04:36.700 --> 04:38.780
Okay, I would say a bold

04:39.460 --> 04:41.460
Call. I mean he could have said

04:41.460 --> 04:47.860
Anything else and it would have made a lot more sense. I thought he was like a lung. Oh

04:48.820 --> 04:55.140
Like one of those like this is what happens when you smoke cigarettes. I thought he was a lung that warned you against vaping

04:55.140 --> 04:57.140
Oh, I see

04:58.020 --> 05:05.980
Yeah, or possibly maybe a very very very sick chicken nugget that fell behind a cash register or something for 15 years

05:05.980 --> 05:09.380
And then they upgraded the cash registers and we're like, what the fuck is that?

05:09.380 --> 05:12.820
So McDonald's had to make an official statement about it

05:12.980 --> 05:16.060
And tell me if you could tell me which one of these three things

05:16.500 --> 05:23.900
Grimace actually is based on the way they structure this sentence whether he's a taste bud a milkshake or just your favorite purple blob

05:24.020 --> 05:30.500
The best part about grimace is that he means different things to different people. Okay, but he's not a fucking milkshake

05:30.660 --> 05:37.460
Uh-huh. He used to be an evil character who stole milkshakes. Yes, but that does not mean that he is a milkshake

05:37.460 --> 05:39.780
You know what? I know that that would be ridiculous

05:39.780 --> 05:44.440
Just because Fred just because Fred Jasso runs around stealing all the soccer balls from all the players in

05:44.980 --> 05:48.060
London that doesn't make him a soccer ball. Do you know what I mean?

05:48.180 --> 05:55.420
Do you think that McDonald's when they originally had the characters of Hamburglar and Mayor McCheese were angling towards like and then one day

05:56.060 --> 05:58.060
The Hamburglar takes his head off

05:58.820 --> 06:02.500
Just steals his head to consume it and then like talk about it

06:02.500 --> 06:07.500
But here's the thing that I realized reading this this story. Okay, we really know about grimace

06:07.900 --> 06:13.820
Tell me right now you guys grew up in like the 80s and 90s. Yeah, what the fuck do you know about grimace?

06:14.700 --> 06:21.460
He used to have two pairs arms like a Goro. Uh-huh. Interesting. That's true. But what do you know about his personality?

06:22.340 --> 06:28.700
He's not happy to be there. He's not he's not um, he's not smart. Oh

06:28.700 --> 06:31.780
Oh, he's filling that Patrick Starr

06:32.780 --> 06:38.320
Sort of yeah. Yeah, both sort of he's filling that void both sort of

06:39.380 --> 06:45.820
Spiritually and physically. Oh, so what you're saying Griffin is that Ronald keeps him around to make him look smart

06:46.260 --> 06:52.420
Didn't McDonald's in their official statements say whether he's a milkshake or a blob. We don't fucking know

06:52.620 --> 06:55.840
Yeah, then maybe you shouldn't have introduced him to the cannon

06:55.840 --> 07:01.200
Well, they also say in the statement whatever he is. We're just proud our bestie makes people happy and that's what got me wondering

07:01.240 --> 07:05.840
When you see grimace, are you like, oh, I'm filled with happiness. Oh, I'm so fucking happy right now

07:05.840 --> 07:12.000
I would say first off you guys have not put that motherfucker in an ad for 20 years. This is my bestie

07:12.000 --> 07:16.280
Yeah, your besties like corn syrup like it's not grimace

07:16.280 --> 07:22.520
I don't even know if they're using Ronald that much anymore. No, they retired all of them when with a bunch of

07:22.520 --> 07:28.480
Real party poopers decided to dress up like killer clowns and hide in bushes and scare people

07:29.280 --> 07:36.320
Ronald got shuffled aside. Thank you. Take talk as always. Good job. I think they should just be very

07:37.880 --> 07:41.960
Happy that Brian didn't go wilder because he had the stage

07:41.960 --> 07:47.120
Yeah, for some reason Brian was handed the conch shell my man could have fully been like, oh

07:47.880 --> 07:49.920
Ronald he's a sapient wolf

07:49.920 --> 07:51.820
Oh

07:51.820 --> 07:57.440
What's grimace do? Well, he's an alien and he's here to impregnate all of our pineapples

07:58.160 --> 08:02.040
What what the a lot of people won't tell you is if you let grimace it gets you high

08:02.680 --> 08:05.680
Fuck and they're like, oh what is grimace? Well, he's a

08:06.440 --> 08:11.280
Representation of the darkness that lives in all of us. They're lucky. He only stuck to McDonald's

08:11.900 --> 08:13.900
Properties and wasn't like he's a tastebud

08:14.720 --> 08:17.780
Gritty's a nut gritty is a gritty is a

08:17.780 --> 08:21.820
Gritty's a nut sack. I can say whatever

08:25.180 --> 08:28.260
Grimace is our ideal customer McDonald's

08:28.260 --> 08:34.300
He's got a big fat hole ready to shove down all the different foods you have and a juicy ass

08:34.500 --> 08:40.980
A juicy ass with plenty of burger space as we call it. We love it and he's kind of like a triangle

08:40.980 --> 08:46.160
That's what we want. Yeah, cuz there's a he's a kind of a kind of a

08:46.160 --> 08:53.140
Illuminati. Yeah. Oh have we mentioned that we're all in the Illuminati, you know heads back to Ronald

08:53.140 --> 08:59.900
I'm Brian Bates out and it seems like mr. Bates. It seems like your store was there was no turnover

09:00.480 --> 09:05.020
Increase affected by coven. We're just wondering what your secret is. I fucked Louie the lightning bug

09:05.020 --> 09:14.300
Do you think you're gonna get in trouble with the McDonald's higher-ups for these guys they'll have to catch me

09:14.840 --> 09:20.800
Rubble rubble and it's the perfect crime. It's the perfect crime because they can't they can't they can't fire you

09:21.160 --> 09:28.640
That would be so you'd be elected president or against prime minister. Like do you can't fire you for saying that grimaces?

09:28.640 --> 09:36.960
They're gonna elevate him to a place where he can be silenced right like that's what happened when you start spilling the beans like this

09:36.960 --> 09:38.420
Right. It's like well, we can't fire him

09:38.420 --> 09:44.800
So now he's gonna be like, you know a CEO or like he's gonna be in charge of like food studies or whatever

09:44.800 --> 09:50.860
And we're gonna lock him away in like whatever a McDonald's version of area 54 is which is probably just area 54

09:51.720 --> 09:53.720
It's not area 54

09:54.920 --> 09:57.320
54 is the sexy club. Okay and

09:57.320 --> 10:02.280
In studio 51 is the science club where they have aliens that dance all night

10:02.960 --> 10:05.960
Area 54 is the sexy club for nerds

10:07.720 --> 10:12.560
Wait, does that exist wait fuck does that exist cuz we can capitalize on that

10:13.640 --> 10:21.220
Definitely. All right. Listen, well, that's that's enough of McDonald land top. We talked a lot about McDonald land care bring back birdie

10:21.920 --> 10:26.040
She's a strong character. Birdie was the one birdie was cookies, right?

10:26.040 --> 10:27.040
I

10:27.040 --> 10:32.920
Thought birdie. Well, yeah, she wouldn't be literally times a flat circle. Yeah, it's true. I can't talk about

10:34.600 --> 10:39.120
Nuggets who wanted to be we gotta get out we gotta go we gotta go. You're right. You're right. Let's do a question. Yeah

10:39.680 --> 10:45.560
This is I say this is my show. It's there's no way my brother my brother means advice shift the modular

10:45.560 --> 10:47.480
Okay in the before times

10:47.480 --> 10:53.860
I purchased an electric kettle for my office with the intention of providing myself and my co-workers with hot water for tea

10:53.860 --> 10:59.460
Which according to Justin McElroy power rankings one of the top ten reasons to buy a kettle?

10:59.460 --> 11:05.640
Absolutely hot water. Well, but it's also a power move to do it for others. Like you're you're kind of

11:06.260 --> 11:13.320
Prometheus at that point sure we've been out of the office since March 2020 and why I'm being asked to pick up our

11:16.780 --> 11:22.460
I'm gonna get something ripped a stinky beaver and then you had to reupholster the place

11:22.460 --> 11:24.460
Oh

11:31.740 --> 11:38.680
Well, it's funny is that there's somebody ripped a beaver in February 2020 unrelated and they got out just in time actually

11:38.680 --> 11:41.260
I heard that this beaver was made in the lab

11:42.260 --> 11:45.120
human could have made a beaver and the

11:45.980 --> 11:47.780
being spread on 5g

11:47.780 --> 11:53.900
The CEOs the CEO of the company is sending emails every week and like guys, we're all kovat free

11:53.900 --> 11:57.060
It's aces over here. Don't worry about it. But this beaver

11:59.780 --> 12:05.380
But I think we reupholster the place Tuesday, it smells fine Thursday the beaver came back

12:05.380 --> 12:08.100
We think the beaver is hiding somewhere in the drop ceiling

12:08.940 --> 12:10.940
We've got our best people in there

12:11.340 --> 12:15.880
So anyway that happened and now we're being asked to pick up our belongings

12:15.880 --> 12:19.620
Belongings so the CEO can sell the space. Good luck

12:20.160 --> 12:22.160
Sounds like fart

12:22.960 --> 12:27.480
This tea kettle still belonged to me and can I take it home I

12:28.000 --> 12:34.420
Have a tea kettle at home already the exact same kettle actually may you best love the performance

12:35.920 --> 12:38.280
Once you find it you found it, you know, yeah

12:39.160 --> 12:43.800
But I did buy this kettle and leaving it behind would imply it belongs to the office

12:43.800 --> 12:48.980
I don't want to disappoint any of the people who will work in the new office by taking the kettle

12:49.120 --> 12:56.120
But I don't know if anyone remembers I purchased the kettle to begin with is it stealing to take communal kettle that I purchased

12:56.120 --> 12:58.120
That's from bubbling in Boston

12:58.640 --> 13:05.720
I don't know if the CEO selling the space you do there's no expectation that the kettle would be left behind

13:05.720 --> 13:14.300
It's not yeah, it doesn't commute the kettle. I think the easiest solution for this is you do raise

13:14.300 --> 13:19.060
This up the flagpole to the CEO who lives at the top of the flagpole and say like hey

13:19.420 --> 13:24.740
I'm not gonna make a big deal out of this. This was a gift for my colleagues, but I do want a slice of

13:25.220 --> 13:31.260
The profits from if they sell the space and the kettle goes with the state auction

13:31.500 --> 13:33.900
Yes, then they should get you know

13:33.900 --> 13:35.900
five percent of

13:36.260 --> 13:43.140
this of this of the sale you could just recreate the this communal experience by every time you have a zoom call just set out

13:43.140 --> 13:48.180
Like 12 cups of tea and pour it into it and then hold it up to the camera

13:48.180 --> 13:54.020
So people can take drinks of it and everything that way you're still making tea for everybody and it won't be weird at all

13:54.220 --> 14:00.820
We're not having enough fakey fake imaginary tea parties on thank you. Yeah, we could be having so much more fun with this

14:00.820 --> 14:07.440
Which are imaginary biscuits? Hey, we have to get more work done on these zoom calls guys. We're having too many fucking tea parties

14:08.380 --> 14:10.380
Going under

14:10.660 --> 14:12.660
Got a lot of thirsty teddies. I

14:13.180 --> 14:20.140
Feel like this is a non-issue and I don't maybe it's a very very expensive kettle

14:20.340 --> 14:24.420
But I also feel like if you have a kettle that is the same kettle already

14:24.420 --> 14:27.140
You don't need two kettles knocking around the house

14:27.140 --> 14:31.820
But oh, but I will also say has someone who is like cleaned up. So when I worked at

14:32.220 --> 14:37.620
The theater like and whenever we'd have turnover or whatever people would always have this like well

14:37.620 --> 14:41.860
I'll leave this behind and someone else will use it and it's like fuck no take it

14:42.060 --> 14:49.140
Take it away because no one else will use it and it's garbage, right? So like don't leave it there. They're selling the space

14:49.140 --> 14:53.940
So if you don't take it, no one else is gonna take it. I don't want to zoom in though

14:53.940 --> 14:59.500
I think what the person is saying is that they didn't develop a strong

14:59.660 --> 15:06.300
They didn't do a good job of branding the kettle as Greg's kettle. Yes, right

15:06.300 --> 15:12.180
They didn't make a big and honestly everybody had a lot on their mind. I think when the kettle was first

15:13.100 --> 15:20.220
They don't clarify when they just say that they bought it and then so if this was like March 1st

15:20.220 --> 15:25.460
Yes, good point in Charleston. It probably got buried underneath some other news

15:26.180 --> 15:27.620
That's true

15:27.620 --> 15:31.940
But I would say let this be a lesson to others if you're gonna buy a communal tea kettle

15:32.060 --> 15:39.080
What's the point of doing that if you're not using it to raise your profile in the office like like that water got pretty hot

15:39.080 --> 15:45.140
I'm pretty quick. That's thanks to this guy. Don't burn your mouth on my super hot water. Yeah, let go of the material goods

15:45.140 --> 15:49.700
You don't leave it there someone else will have to take care of it

15:49.700 --> 15:51.580
Not someone else will have to take care of it

15:51.580 --> 15:56.620
Like it just you don't need if you get a second kind of weekend do upstairs kettle

15:56.620 --> 16:02.980
No one needs to move. We all love the idea of having a second coffee station in our home somewhere

16:02.980 --> 16:04.020
We all love it

16:04.020 --> 16:08.860
But none of us have it's like it's like you see people with a bar in their house like what you got a whole other

16:09.020 --> 16:14.380
Set up there. You got a bunch of other glasses. Yeah, let's move to the other room

16:14.380 --> 16:18.120
Right. Exactly. The party continues there. No, it doesn't

16:20.420 --> 16:25.100
Especially when you're as old as we are the party will dissipate in eight steps. You can't do that

16:25.100 --> 16:26.980
Yeah, here's what I'm gonna say though Justin

16:26.980 --> 16:32.420
No one's gonna come through this office space like touring it to see if they want to purchase it to be like and does that?

16:32.820 --> 16:40.140
Ten cup kettle come with the space. Is that right? Is that included? No, take it home and give it to somebody else

16:40.140 --> 16:45.900
But why why it's your responsibility you brought it into the space to take it out

16:46.100 --> 16:52.100
No incorrect you gave it a gift to the office. It is the CEOs responsibility. They're gonna sell this office

16:52.100 --> 16:55.300
They're done with having a physical space to their employees fine

16:55.340 --> 17:01.260
But they have to figure out the problem with the teacup you did a generous thing and brought in an office. Honestly, I

17:01.780 --> 17:07.660
Think not providing a tea kettle to your employees is against OSHA. Yes, probably. Yeah, you've convinced me actually

17:07.660 --> 17:12.260
This is the CEOs problem. It's a CEOs problem. Not yours. They're liquidating

17:12.780 --> 17:14.220
Take care

17:14.220 --> 17:19.700
What the fuck else are they doing? If not, you figuring this out, you know what I mean?

17:19.700 --> 17:23.820
Like they do they they deliberate all the other shit out and other people are doing it

17:23.820 --> 17:29.960
And so like give them something to do so they feel like ah a good day's work. I threw away a tea kettle

17:30.980 --> 17:33.500
Hey, should we approach the wizard? Yeah

17:33.500 --> 17:35.500
We're

17:37.580 --> 17:41.020
Yeah, sure, I got teeth sweaters, you know what I mean, yeah, you don't want to

17:41.580 --> 17:45.980
you when you supplicate yourself before the wizard of the cloud you do need to

17:47.180 --> 17:51.300
Have the freshest the freshest well and the wizard always likes it when you bear your teeth

17:51.980 --> 17:56.940
In a sign of submission. He thinks it's rude when you don't show your teeth that absolutely

17:57.420 --> 18:01.460
A lot of people sent this one in over the course of the last couple months

18:01.460 --> 18:08.940
So thank you to everybody who did that. It's uh, it's well, I can't find it author info on this one

18:09.940 --> 18:15.820
So let's say is anonymous but there it's important question because they ask how to form an animal pack. Oh

18:16.500 --> 18:20.060
Do you love animals and dream of creating a pack of them with your friends?

18:20.060 --> 18:24.820
Yeah, you can now you can wait with your friends with your friends now

18:24.820 --> 18:30.160
You can you can roleplay as any animal as long as you know how to form your pack and how to make it fairly

18:30.160 --> 18:32.840
Realistic, I'm not interested anymore. Oh

18:33.800 --> 18:37.040
fair fair did they type FA I

18:37.920 --> 18:40.240
Rly or F E R a L

18:40.920 --> 18:42.920
Oh, why fairly really realistic?

18:43.880 --> 18:46.460
Fairly realistic or fairly realistic now

18:46.460 --> 18:50.280
They just mean sort of real like we're gonna have fun with our friends and form an animal pack

18:50.280 --> 18:57.000
But we're not gonna be like dicks dicks about I thought that this was gonna be about how to form a pack of animals

18:57.000 --> 19:04.340
Actually a way cooler wiki how a way cooler and way more useful practical wiki how article because here's here's the thing

19:04.340 --> 19:06.340
I don't need them all the time

19:06.400 --> 19:12.920
No, but I like the idea of like, oh man some shits going down to me and then just like yes

19:12.920 --> 19:18.320
You know a pack of wolves shows up like you called Travis and I'm like, yes tonight we hunt

19:18.960 --> 19:20.560
Yeah, um, yeah

19:20.560 --> 19:26.360
I would do birds probably some sort of bird of prey some sort of raptor of this guy like a hawk or something like that

19:26.360 --> 19:31.800
Just so I don't have to like keep tabs on them when I'm not fucking Raven would be cool. Are you kidding me?

19:31.800 --> 19:36.720
Well, so I'm like Ravens. Yeah. Okay. Anyway collect members. We don't know how to do that

19:36.960 --> 19:43.640
No, no, we don't know how to collect Ravens. No, like to gather a pack if we as a species knew how to have a pack of

19:44.440 --> 19:47.520
Like collect a pack of animals every wiki. How about it? That's true

19:47.520 --> 19:51.760
No, that's a good point. But this is how to have fun with your friends like at a park at a park or something

19:51.760 --> 19:57.640
One collect members if you want to be an outsider and live with up to four people or less

19:57.640 --> 20:01.720
You are not a full pack and therefore your miniature pack does not have to have a name

20:04.240 --> 20:07.520
Members who want to be part of a pack should join a pack with at least five people or more

20:07.520 --> 20:11.560
So just to start things out with if it's less than five people you are not a pack

20:11.560 --> 20:16.480
You don't deserve a name and get the fuck out of here get the fuck out of this part because this is for

20:16.840 --> 20:18.840
real animal packs only

20:18.840 --> 20:21.880
This I've written there. Can it be a virtual pack Griffin?

20:21.880 --> 20:25.920
Like can we it absolutely cannot be a virtual pack Travis that fucking suck

20:25.920 --> 20:30.840
Thank you. Thank you for your terrible question, but some of my pack lives in like San Francisco

20:31.240 --> 20:37.140
Okay, listen your pack. You can't yeah these days listen. Hey this article

20:37.840 --> 20:39.840
Take some twisty turns

20:40.240 --> 20:47.240
Decide ranks for your pack miniature packs. Don't have ranks another reason why if you're rocking with less than five people

20:47.240 --> 20:51.120
Yes, is you got a clown cluster? That's not a pack

20:51.120 --> 20:57.000
We can all agree that that is something that has come up in real life for that person who's writing this article, right?

20:57.240 --> 21:02.980
Yeah, and Jerry before you fucking ask me again. No three is in a pack. Okay?

21:03.680 --> 21:08.840
There must be a leader and the fairest way to do. This is to hold an election, you know, like wolves do

21:09.840 --> 21:11.240
Remember not say that

21:11.240 --> 21:18.520
No, remember not to vote for yourself if there is a tie have a mini wrestle or rock-paper-scissors battle then let the audience vote for who?

21:18.520 --> 21:20.520
they think is the best so

21:20.640 --> 21:21.800
Yeah

21:21.800 --> 21:27.120
If animals any animal could vote for itself, it would absolutely do

21:29.320 --> 21:30.600
Myself

21:30.600 --> 21:35.160
Existence is voting for yourself. I every day. I think I'd be a great leader

21:35.160 --> 21:40.000
Like that's not a rule that exists in any other election you ever like yeah

21:40.000 --> 21:45.880
Oh, yeah president lost by one vote cuz I think they weren't allowed to vote for themselves. That's embarrassing

21:46.840 --> 21:51.080
The rest of the pack and decide whether they just kind of dropped the word audience by the way

21:51.080 --> 21:55.000
I assume they mean the rest of the pack, but they're watching

21:55.000 --> 21:59.920
Yeah, there is a chance that if you're hanging out with your animal pack at the park, there might be a bit of an audience

22:00.280 --> 22:06.000
Yeah, I would guess I mean they you see people watching the SCA people down at the park, you know

22:06.000 --> 22:10.120
Yeah, she's a more thing society for creative animals

22:11.280 --> 22:17.900
Decide what animal the members in the pack will be and this includes many packs hold an election if there's a draw have everyone top

22:17.900 --> 22:23.000
On the vote on the top two very democratic process forming an animal pack is yeah

22:23.000 --> 22:28.680
I have to say this this is this is where I feel like this person writing this article has not done this

22:29.040 --> 22:31.040
because I feel like I

22:31.040 --> 22:35.780
I have a hard enough time getting friends together to like

22:36.840 --> 22:41.080
Play a board game without a very clear idea of like what game we're gonna play

22:41.240 --> 22:46.680
There's no I there's no way you could get a bunch of people together to do this

22:47.300 --> 22:50.080
Unless you have the specific animal

22:51.160 --> 22:52.640
ahead of time

22:52.640 --> 22:56.240
to to lure them into this activity

22:56.240 --> 23:02.980
Yeah, I also really feel like just by the very nature of this that there should be a step in this wiki

23:02.980 --> 23:07.840
How that's just like hey news flash if you're the one reading this wiki how you're the leader

23:08.080 --> 23:11.500
You're the leader and you get to pick the animal and everything, right?

23:12.480 --> 23:18.000
What are you gonna do reach out to somebody like hey, I want you to be in charge and pick the animal

23:18.000 --> 23:23.360
I just really love the idea of it. No, you're in charge take charge

23:23.360 --> 23:29.880
Who's deciding who the president of the animal pack is and then deciding what the animal says because that's a good way to get stuck

23:29.880 --> 23:30.920
with being like

23:30.920 --> 23:39.080
King idiot bird or whatever. Well, oh, I have different friends though. Dick sell is the leader of different animal groups. Exactly

23:39.080 --> 23:40.580
Thank you. Yes

23:40.580 --> 23:44.720
Name your pack. I would make you the leader of like a parrot type group

23:44.720 --> 23:51.140
Oh, I just repeat those shit that that's real nice child. No because of your beautiful plumage. Yeah, sure

23:51.140 --> 23:53.140
Because you talk good

23:53.940 --> 23:58.020
Justin I think I would probably make you the leader of you know, like

23:59.940 --> 24:02.060
Wow, I can't even think of it sells

24:03.420 --> 24:07.740
Okay, Giselle, but yeah, I wouldn't make you the leader of a bunch of Giselle's

24:08.500 --> 24:14.580
Okay. Yeah, and I think I'd be the leader of like some really cool like wolves. Yeah, but you can't

24:15.260 --> 24:17.260
You can't vote for yourself though

24:17.260 --> 24:23.100
Okay, I'm gonna be a werewolf then all right name your pack this one's optional for many packs

24:24.340 --> 24:29.980
So glad cuz I wanted to form a mini pack and I thought after the first point this article was not going to be for me

24:29.980 --> 24:32.180
But they keep breaking me off little crumbs and I appreciate that

24:32.540 --> 24:36.460
Try to use creative names instead of a more common one hold an election for the pack names

24:36.460 --> 24:41.900
And if there's a tie let the leader decide again unbelievable how what what is the leader's job?

24:41.900 --> 24:43.900
If not to decide these things

24:43.900 --> 24:48.860
This is where the shit takes a turn decide your character's name gender appearance and backstory

24:48.860 --> 24:53.820
You don't have to but it's more fun. It makes your pack more realistic. Okay, so all right

24:53.820 --> 24:58.820
I need my boys together for the wolf pack. Oh, first of all, we didn't vote on the animal. Okay, you're yeah

24:59.020 --> 25:03.780
Yeah, okay. You're right. I want to be kangaroos. Okay. We're a kangaroo pack. Who's in charge? I'm in charge great

25:04.220 --> 25:06.220
My name is Mephistopheles

25:07.060 --> 25:11.560
Karistikov and I am a gray kangaroo with a jetpack

25:11.560 --> 25:13.560
Oh

25:13.920 --> 25:21.280
Okay, can we do it like a quick note session can we do this do we vote on that? No, we do not shit

25:21.280 --> 25:23.280
Okay, I don't know just feels like

25:25.000 --> 25:27.760
It's gonna be hard enough to convince people that we're kangaroos

25:28.320 --> 25:34.160
Did you has the kangaroo make the jetpacker did like a scientist give it to you? I found it in a cave

25:34.640 --> 25:39.360
Why it's a magical jetpack? Okay. Okay, Derek Derek real quick

25:39.360 --> 25:44.880
Can we step outside the bit for a second? It's a magical jetpack. Like yeah, I'm sorry

25:44.880 --> 25:50.800
You lost the alpha kangaroo election, but like you're kind of being an asshole right now right now

25:50.800 --> 25:57.040
You are and my jetpack lets me control the mind of other kangaroos. Okay. All right. No, that's great, Derek

25:57.640 --> 26:00.320
Okay, so map out your territory. Whatever this

26:02.360 --> 26:05.960
Get Ally packs once you have about 10 to 20 members

26:05.960 --> 26:11.600
What the fuck try to form alliances with other packs after all there's strength in numbers

26:11.600 --> 26:15.800
Yeah, you know how you've heard of other people doing this thing. Yeah around you not good news

26:16.000 --> 26:19.840
it's it's a jump after a jump because it's like once you have

26:20.720 --> 26:24.860
Invited 15 other people. Hey, yeah, me and my friends do this thing

26:25.880 --> 26:33.040
It's pretty cool. And if 15 people join you're like, oh damn. Did you hear about this rival group of of 20?

26:33.040 --> 26:38.180
20 fake koala bears. Let's let's go get them. Let's go beat their asses though

26:38.880 --> 26:45.560
Because that is actually sorry spoiler alert the next tip get rival packs once you've got 20 to 30 members

26:46.000 --> 26:50.760
Start start turning down offers for others to join your pack or let the leader decide

26:51.040 --> 26:52.600
Doesn't say vote on it on this one

26:52.600 --> 26:57.040
But I do think that that's an option if you decline you could suggest they create a rival pack

26:57.040 --> 27:00.760
I would like to address the big fake elephant in the room

27:00.760 --> 27:05.400
okay, and say that if anybody's reading this and thinks

27:06.040 --> 27:12.760
Actually, it sounds like you're a furry and that's fine. Go do that. That's awesome. It's fine. But like why are you putting it?

27:12.760 --> 27:14.760
I bet they're hurry

27:15.040 --> 27:19.560
Several furries. Let's see this who are like that sounds like so much fucking lot of work

27:19.560 --> 27:23.400
How about just like get a costume and you like live your life? Yeah

27:23.680 --> 27:29.720
Can you imagine going in there like I'd love to be an animal pack and then they're like, yeah

27:29.720 --> 27:31.720
We're fucking kangaroos. I'm like, no, I'm not

27:33.120 --> 27:38.360
You can all be kangaroos and I was adopted by kangaroos and I'm a marmoset or whatever like

27:39.480 --> 27:42.160
I'd watch that. I'd watch that unlikely animal friend story

27:43.480 --> 27:48.320
Like I'm I'm a cheetah cub that was adopted by kangaroos. I protect them now. Yeah, fuck

27:48.320 --> 27:52.120
Yeah, actually you don't need to kangaroos are fucking terrifying. Yeah, they're really scary

27:53.000 --> 27:55.040
It all kind of culminates here

27:55.040 --> 28:00.160
I mean, there's more tips after this one, but tip number 10 is have battles and border raids

28:00.560 --> 28:03.960
No, these can be acted out as once again

28:04.520 --> 28:09.840
Many wrestles or rock-paper-scissors battles actually take that back. I would love to watch that

28:09.840 --> 28:13.960
I mean, I would love to watch adults have a mini wrestle on the quad

28:15.320 --> 28:20.240
That would be good for me. Okay. Okay. Okay, but here's my question and this is very important

28:20.240 --> 28:23.880
It's not clarified here. Yeah, if there is a border dispute

28:23.880 --> 28:26.800
Yeah, let's say a gang of

28:27.760 --> 28:35.280
Rhinoceroses, yeah gang of kangaroos when they many wrestle do they have to wrestle in the manner of kangaroo?

28:35.960 --> 28:40.240
Kangaroos and rhinoceroses or do they wrestle in human manner?

28:41.040 --> 28:43.000
first of all the the

28:43.000 --> 28:49.760
Collective name for rhino. I rhino is a crash of rhinoceri. Okay, it's very good and you gotta respect that

28:49.760 --> 28:55.960
I don't I think you may have accidentally backed up into what would be the best sort of animal squad

28:56.280 --> 29:00.640
Like if a crash a crash is coming your way. You don't want a mini wrestle with a crash of rhino

29:00.640 --> 29:01.880
This is what I'm saying way

29:01.880 --> 29:07.440
What if it's like a bunch of lemurs right and you're a gang of rhinoceri and you're like a crash, excuse me

29:07.440 --> 29:11.320
And you're like, oh we can take lemurs, but then they show up and it's like some like six foot eight

29:12.000 --> 29:15.720
Absolutely built human beings. You're like we are the lemurs and you're like fuck

29:15.720 --> 29:18.920
I just jacked people are secretly lemurs

29:18.920 --> 29:25.760
This is I'm saying and here here you are like 120 pounds soaking wet rhinoceri and like you're like fuck

29:25.760 --> 29:30.960
You know what? We've overplayed our hands. I do not want a mini wrestle and once again Travis you have brought up a

29:31.520 --> 29:35.720
Really interesting edge case because a group of lemurs is called the conspiracy of lemurs

29:35.720 --> 29:41.240
and that's tough that's tough to beat a conspiracy of lemurs versus a crash of rhinoceri is I

29:41.240 --> 29:46.800
Actually, that one's a fucking toss-up. I wanted to say two points. The first is

29:47.400 --> 29:51.920
We basically did what they're describing in our safety town episode of my brother my brother

29:51.920 --> 29:55.160
I mean, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, it's a real thing, too. Yeah

29:55.920 --> 30:00.520
But the other thing I want to say is that you guys know how many spider-man villains have done this exact same thing

30:00.640 --> 30:06.420
Yeah, I kind of trips you out when you think about it. Like that one guy got armor and he's like, I don't know now

30:06.760 --> 30:08.760
Everybody's like I don't think so

30:08.760 --> 30:14.400
Okay, you want to challenge me cuz I'm gonna fucking hit you in the face with myself and you're like, yeah, you're right

30:15.040 --> 30:20.200
Your vulture you say no way. Oh, look at him. All right. He's up there. Fuck. Oh fuck my arm

30:20.200 --> 30:22.780
Oh shit, my arm fell off. Oh grew back lizard now

30:26.800 --> 30:33.160
That they're more like this what they're more committed like the because they're able to deliver on some of the animal abilities

30:33.160 --> 30:35.160
It's like less. Yeah

30:35.160 --> 30:40.080
Listen if someone was like I'm a right now you're like no, you're not and they charge us through like a fucking concrete wall

30:40.080 --> 30:42.080
You're like fuck

30:42.200 --> 30:45.680
You might you charge through a concrete wall

30:46.440 --> 30:48.440
You might be a rhino

30:49.720 --> 30:54.380
I'm just saying man that there are certain abilities that someone could demonstrate in front of me

30:54.380 --> 30:58.680
That would make me say like well fuck I got you know, what we'll get you differently from that one

30:58.960 --> 31:02.160
Yeah, you are fucking if somebody's like I'm a vulture and I was like no

31:02.160 --> 31:07.680
You're not and then they like took off into the air and then buried their heads into a rotting carcass. I'd be like, oh fuck

31:07.680 --> 31:11.240
Okay, fuck. Yeah, cool, man. I'm not gonna challenge you anymore. I'm so sorry

31:11.440 --> 31:16.600
Michael Keaton's eating a dead buffalo that's been there for a while. Holy shit. I know awesome

31:16.640 --> 31:18.400
That guy's awesome this fuck

31:18.400 --> 31:24.360
Can I also say that there's part of me that 12 year old and maybe even older than that Travis would have been like, yeah

31:24.360 --> 31:27.560
Let's go fucking be a pack of wolves in the park. That sounds fucking awesome

31:27.560 --> 31:34.000
I would have totally done this and I I maybe have poked fun at this thing

31:34.000 --> 31:38.560
Then I would sincerely want to do. Yeah, sure just burn down the rest of this

31:38.560 --> 31:41.560
Let everyone know about it is step 11 with posters all around the campus

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
Let me say as a person who has cared about things before don't do that

31:48.000 --> 31:52.520
Don't do that get the leader to make about three to five rules that all pack members must obey

31:52.520 --> 31:54.520
There's no way that that could go bad

31:54.520 --> 31:59.080
And that is also the best best part about being an alpha wolf in any man

31:59.080 --> 32:06.000
Pack is having to make and enforce rules. Yeah. Yeah, I get all the spaghetti Charles. I don't know what that

32:06.760 --> 32:10.480
Means but it's on the it's on it is on the ledger

32:10.600 --> 32:16.600
So only six beers per night per person per day Charles. That's a lot

32:17.280 --> 32:20.200
That was only seven beers. You just

32:20.200 --> 32:24.220
Said six Charles. I'm thirsty. I know what I said

32:25.920 --> 32:29.240
Grimace is a taste bud. You can't actually put that one

32:31.240 --> 32:33.240
Anymore

32:34.800 --> 32:39.520
Not since you smash through the wall of the break career charging yelling about how you are a rhinoceros

32:41.280 --> 32:46.440
Established a lot of rhinoceros cred. Yeah. Yeah, and you and don't and Jerry Maguire style

32:46.440 --> 32:50.520
You did pull a lot of people away from that company to join your your Rhino company

32:50.520 --> 32:55.240
But you don't seem to have any kind of like business plan and we all kind of thought this would be a rhino business

32:55.600 --> 32:58.200
Yeah, and you know what we were wrong

32:58.200 --> 33:03.760
But we didn't know we were all so confused and we breathed in so much dust from just a plaster

33:03.760 --> 33:09.480
You had shouted into the air and we all can we go back to work? Hey Charles, can we go get our jobs back?

33:10.280 --> 33:12.720
you know these alt-right goofballs are

33:12.720 --> 33:16.940
Calling a lot of more traditional conservatives

33:18.520 --> 33:23.120
Rhinos like Republican in name only and do they not realize that that's like

33:24.180 --> 33:26.020
That sounds awesome. Yep

33:26.020 --> 33:28.700
Like you're you're being a real fucking rhino right now

33:28.700 --> 33:34.860
Like you mean the big strong animal with the horn that charges and blows up a Jeep by running into it. Thank you very much

33:36.840 --> 33:40.640
Anyway, that's some that's some political hold on and that's some

33:40.640 --> 33:43.080
Oh, hold on and that's some of my political humor

33:45.680 --> 33:52.960
Can we take a quick break and come right back with more great comedy, um, are we gonna I mean are we gonna do ads

33:54.400 --> 33:59.200
Yeah, yeah, I mean that's another way of saying it. Okay. I'm just trying to spice it up a little bit

33:59.200 --> 34:01.200
Well, you just made it sound like we were gonna like

34:01.360 --> 34:06.160
Take a quick break and then let Justin and Travis the Griffith take up the commerce boys. Yeah

34:06.160 --> 34:11.920
I say cause money bros and then and then we'll come back sort of the fun. We'll be like get out of here

34:11.920 --> 34:13.920
Yeah business business

38:53.320 --> 38:55.440
How about another question sure I

38:56.200 --> 38:58.200
recently moved to a really

38:58.200 --> 39:04.880
One no jokes. No, uh, none of your cut-ups. No your classic cut-ups. Okay. No

39:04.880 --> 39:26.360
I recently moved to a new state. I didn't know my podcast. Come on. You don't understand me. I

39:26.360 --> 39:35.960
Want a bunch I want a bunch squad squad. I was kind of going for a BC boy

39:35.960 --> 39:40.900
No, I got that but the problem is the question asker listening the show like oh my question. Oh, no

39:45.240 --> 39:50.240
Yeah, we're gonna get back to it, okay, we're gonna do a two-minute month on your quick. All right, this is quick ones

39:50.240 --> 39:56.040
Um Panda Express to test orange chicken sandwich. This is just to say wait, hold on

39:56.040 --> 40:04.320
Wait, did you say Panda Express to test orange chicken sandwich? And this is just to say how fucking dare you we're trying to hear

40:04.320 --> 40:06.320
I thought you said detest

40:07.000 --> 40:11.200
That they didn't they came up with it. They were like, fuck this awful

40:11.200 --> 40:15.980
I was just wondering the chicken sandwich wars. How dare us just from that headline?

40:15.980 --> 40:20.280
I would like to think that the test is like can we even do this wouldn't it be great?

40:20.280 --> 40:25.940
If that if Panda Express is like we were going to and then we realize we can't do this and we wanted to announce our

40:26.080 --> 40:32.680
Restraint, you know, here's the problem guys the orange chicken. It's all sloppy. We put it on the sandwich to break

40:32.680 --> 40:37.280
It's all slow. We don't know what the fuck to do with this. I hate it. I hate this falls apart

40:37.920 --> 40:43.520
You know the chicken sandwich wars were attempted to be ended by Popeye's right? This is like a month ago

40:43.520 --> 40:46.960
It's still fucking going Panda Express is like can we get up in this?

40:46.960 --> 40:51.800
It's like please I'd rather you did not not Taco Bell is like, I don't know if we're in it or not

40:52.440 --> 40:59.600
Then and now you got jack-in-the-box, which is introduced to the new cluck chicken sandwich and a bbq cluck chicken

40:59.680 --> 41:02.680
Okay. All right. So so the reason I'm

41:05.000 --> 41:07.780
Jack in the box when the nation that's all right

41:07.780 --> 41:15.860
Hey, if you need a minute jack-in-the-box announced the rollout of its new cluck chicken sandwich and bbq cluck chicken sandwich a company

41:15.860 --> 41:18.680
Thank you for pronouncing that correctly. By the way, no one ever pronounces that

41:18.980 --> 41:20.980
cheap marketing campaign

41:20.980 --> 41:28.860
Meant to poke fun at the infamous chicken wars, which I will remind everyone as I tried to every episode has claimed human lives

41:30.300 --> 41:32.580
Along with the significantly bigger and

41:32.580 --> 41:39.900
Crispier upgrade of the cluck chicken and this new cluck bbq cluck chicken and a bbq deluxe cluck chicken

41:40.500 --> 41:47.800
Imagine standing before another human safe species as you and say, oh me. I'll take a bbq deluxe cluck chicken sandwich

41:48.300 --> 41:53.820
The brand broke the news last week with a humorous video press release announcing that jack box

41:54.940 --> 41:59.260
Try again, I guess is the name of the company because it just says jack box here, which I thought was

41:59.260 --> 42:01.940
a different thing. Yeah, all right thing

42:02.620 --> 42:06.020
Purchase the town it jack box had purchased the town

42:07.100 --> 42:09.560
what of chicken, Alaska

42:10.740 --> 42:18.860
Effectively owning chicken and winning the chicken wars for good. Okay. Okay. No. Yeah, great

42:20.020 --> 42:27.100
Great. No. Yeah, great. There's nothing nothing bad could happen out of that right to have a company town

42:27.100 --> 42:31.300
I got old-timey coal five years from now when jack box fucking succeeds

42:31.740 --> 42:32.260
Yeah

42:32.260 --> 42:38.580
Or when jack box only pays people in chicken Alaska with company script to get more chicken fries

42:38.900 --> 42:43.860
To announce the rollout of the new chicken sandwiches the brand lean into its playful and comedic identity

42:44.380 --> 42:51.060
With the campaign surrounding CEO jack boxes purchase of the small-town chicken, Alaska in exchange for

42:51.060 --> 42:58.180
Now you may take a moment here to think about America's own troubled history with purchasing land

42:58.980 --> 43:00.980
for rather ridiculous

43:01.660 --> 43:03.180
Things that are not money

43:03.180 --> 43:09.960
So now I'll complete the sentence and said that it bought the town of chicken, Alaska in exchange for 10,000

43:12.540 --> 43:18.060
That doesn't seem like a lot of money it bought it's no money it's 10,000 said good point juice

43:18.060 --> 43:21.100
It's 10,000 sandwiches, right?

43:22.260 --> 43:26.980
Yeah, and they're but they they'll allow the brand to own chicken for good

43:27.700 --> 43:31.960
Jackbox solidify the deal after a friendly negotiation with current chicken town owners

43:32.860 --> 43:34.860
sue and max

43:35.020 --> 43:40.780
Which I would love to be in the negotiation. I'm assuming that started at 8,000 chicken

43:41.820 --> 43:43.820
Max

43:43.820 --> 43:47.900
Good so careful in those that goes because this could be genie rules

43:47.900 --> 43:52.460
Right where you ask for that and then they deliver them all at once and you're like fuck

43:52.460 --> 43:57.900
I can't eat 10,000 chicken sandwiches by the time this goes bad. He's like, well, you should have worded it more carefully

44:00.200 --> 44:05.800
You want one chicken sandwich every day for 10,000 days that's how you want to phrase it my friends

44:06.940 --> 44:09.620
Yeah, you should yeah, I it is not

44:10.340 --> 44:12.540
clarified in here how these will be like

44:12.540 --> 44:14.540
doled out

44:16.220 --> 44:18.220
What's the population of chicken Alaska

44:19.700 --> 44:21.700
I'm betting to

44:24.220 --> 44:25.900
12

44:25.900 --> 44:28.940
Damn, hold up 12 what 12 people live there?

44:29.700 --> 44:33.100
So much chicken. Yeah, only 12 people. So let me just run some quick numbers

44:34.020 --> 44:37.020
10,000 divided by 12. This is gonna be crazy

44:38.060 --> 44:41.060
800 each one of the members of the chicken

44:41.060 --> 44:42.260
community

44:42.260 --> 44:48.220
Gets eight hundred and thirty three and a third chicken sandwiches. That's so many. They're gonna be so sick

44:53.260 --> 44:58.540
So they did yeah, they did this whole ad about it you sound fucking bummed out juice

44:58.540 --> 45:01.020
Oh, man, this one's hard cuz jack-in-the-box

45:01.540 --> 45:06.580
Usually I love all their endings. I'm gonna see it play a little bit of a commercial or goes cool thing, obviously

45:06.580 --> 45:10.860
Okay, Jack chicken is the French Riviera of Alaska

45:10.900 --> 45:16.380
Okay, and by purchasing chicken Alaska, not only will you win these so-called chicken wars?

45:16.460 --> 45:22.500
But you'll also get the chicken Creek saloon the chicken Creek cafe the chicken mercantile emporium

45:22.780 --> 45:26.180
Cozy cabins and much more interesting. Okay, hear me out

45:26.540 --> 45:31.680
My new cluck sandwich is bigger crispier and better than ever and I will straight-up give you

45:31.680 --> 45:37.060
10,000 of them if you let me own chicken plus I'll throw in a commemorative hat

45:37.480 --> 45:39.120
Wow

45:39.120 --> 45:41.200
10,000 sandwiches is your

45:42.200 --> 45:48.400
What can I say? All right, Jack, you've got a deal chicken is yours and it's just that

45:49.680 --> 45:52.720
He didn't just buy it for 10,000 sandwiches

45:52.720 --> 46:00.360
I don't for 10,000 sandwiches and a half. Yeah, and that's pretty messed up also cuz there's two people on the phone

46:09.760 --> 46:11.160
Fuck you know what?

46:11.160 --> 46:17.840
I love about that ad is that this spokesperson for chicken Alaska named several small businesses the chicken mercantile

46:17.840 --> 46:24.480
Emporium the chicken Creek saloon the chicken Creek cafe all of which will probably be put out of business

46:24.880 --> 46:27.560
By the info by the importing of 10

46:28.480 --> 46:31.040
Chicken sandwiches into this town of 12

46:31.760 --> 46:35.120
Yeah, that's I can't do the math of that

46:35.120 --> 46:39.400
But it's a I just gonna say it's a lot of sandwiches per person and then what really?

46:39.520 --> 46:44.920
We're really chaps my ass about this commercial which by the way in the 13 days since its release has had

46:44.920 --> 46:50.960
Two thousand three hundred and fifty four people view it or one guy view it a lot of times

46:52.040 --> 46:59.040
There's a message at the end where it says no, we didn't really buy chicken Alaska with our new club chicken sandwich. Come on

46:59.040 --> 47:05.160
Oh, that's ridiculous. Just like the chicken wars are ridiculous. There's nothing fucking funnier

47:05.920 --> 47:11.400
Me when you do a big crazy campaign like this, there's nothing funnier than when you're like

47:11.400 --> 47:14.680
Also, we were joking. Hey everyone

47:15.360 --> 47:20.960
Joke when they say but we're proud to call chicken Alaska our new friends and partners. Okay

47:22.080 --> 47:24.320
But they just and then they did

47:24.920 --> 47:30.140
Them and then it says while we don't own chicken Alaska because they're kin guys

47:30.640 --> 47:37.800
This was a joke that we did for a laugh to promote chicken while we don't own chicken, Alaska

47:37.840 --> 47:39.840
We did donate

47:39.840 --> 47:46.400
Thousand dollars to help the town recover from the pandemic. Oh, all right money, please

47:47.160 --> 47:53.080
Money, they did said I was thinking about 10,000 sandwiches. No, although I

47:54.280 --> 47:59.720
Mean an act of largesse like that. I'm sure would have been very meaningful at the beginning, you know

47:59.720 --> 48:05.000
Because the dollar value I don't know what these sandwiches cost, but it's probably more than a buck, right?

48:05.000 --> 48:09.040
You would think you would think you

48:10.120 --> 48:16.680
Would think if you're gonna do a bit or you give them 10,000 cluck sandwiches in this exchange for your town

48:17.320 --> 48:21.400
that maybe you could give him the cash equivalent of

48:22.600 --> 48:27.960
10,000 sandwiches, right? Yeah, maybe you would think that would be kind of a nice

48:28.440 --> 48:33.220
It's not but it's not as clean. Is it it's just not as clean

48:33.220 --> 48:38.220
All right, what's that price on that bbq cluck sandwich? They're not gonna show me on the website. Are they no, it's not

48:38.720 --> 48:44.040
Cowards, we don't have a jack of the box around here son. We know what I'm saying. It's at least what?

48:44.480 --> 48:46.480
two and a half three bucks

48:46.560 --> 48:52.720
Gotta be gotta gotta be this big boy with I see I'm looking at a picture of it for pickles on it

48:52.720 --> 48:55.160
That's yeah. Yeah, that's not free. I

48:56.280 --> 49:00.800
Recently moved to a new state and I don't have any friends here with children do the pandemic

49:00.800 --> 49:05.880
Scouts aren't posting up outside grocery stores to take your cash. How do I secure?

49:06.880 --> 49:12.260
Secure, how do I secure access to girl scout cookies without in the existing kid connection?

49:12.400 --> 49:15.880
That's from still mad about Savannah smiles in Savannah

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
How do you get?

49:19.920 --> 49:25.480
Hmm I mean there's there to put jokes outside of the room there's an app

49:26.360 --> 49:29.060
There's an app. Is there an app for that? There's an app for that. Yeah, it's

49:29.060 --> 49:33.940
It's a it is called the cookie finder and it's they'll help you

49:34.020 --> 49:41.460
They'll help you get where you're going here. Now. Are you gonna have to drive an hour and a half to get there? Maybe but

49:44.980 --> 49:50.780
Worth it. How do I bet it? Yeah, because I don't want to give my cookie dollars

49:51.180 --> 49:56.880
To like a girl scout who's not gonna appreciate going to camp or maybe it's just a real jag

49:56.880 --> 50:00.160
yeah, and also, I mean you gotta be like I have a

50:01.080 --> 50:05.960
You know, I have my my squad that I go to because I trust their product

50:05.960 --> 50:11.820
But you can't just like go just you know, stop outside of some CVS or you see somebody who might be selling, you know

50:12.760 --> 50:20.820
Cut cut tagalongs absolute sniggle friends. Yeah, you don't know. Sorry. Is this is this? Oh, this is baking soda

50:21.360 --> 50:24.160
Yeah, there is baking soda you put coconut in this

50:24.160 --> 50:30.720
That's if you don't like coconut and it's in something that's not supposed to have that right? Yeah. Okay. I got I got

50:30.920 --> 50:34.660
That's a you know, you almost wonder if coconut was the right thing to pick. Yeah

50:36.160 --> 50:38.160
That you didn't really buy chicken Alaska

50:40.720 --> 50:48.520
Yeah, I mean there's there's there's it's 2021 there's digital resources for your literal every human desire

50:48.520 --> 50:54.600
So it's tough. It's tough to deal with a question like this knowing that that is always a hundred percent going to be true

50:55.400 --> 50:58.680
I was so disappointed because I I

51:00.520 --> 51:08.040
There's a thing on the website that says you can text cookies Oh to five nine six one eight and then what happens

51:08.480 --> 51:12.280
What happened was they sent me a link? Yeah, and what it did was

51:13.720 --> 51:18.000
They it just sent me the Girl Scout cookies website. What a disappointment

51:18.000 --> 51:23.800
Yeah, you kind of just want a text an automated text response to that to pop up that says we're on our way

51:24.080 --> 51:26.880
We know what you need Justin. We're on our way

51:27.200 --> 51:33.000
Can I just say as a parent and I don't like to play that card very often as a parent. I

51:33.640 --> 51:37.860
Searched what the cookie rewards are for Girl Scouts to sell these motherfuckers

51:38.600 --> 51:40.600
This is this is some

51:40.600 --> 51:47.840
Chucky cheese prize counter level bullshit. Yeah for the amount of work that I the actual

51:48.440 --> 51:54.320
Person am going to have to do to deliver these fucking cookies and you've got inflatable

51:54.880 --> 51:56.880
ottoman on there come

51:58.720 --> 52:03.440
Garbage that's fun a mini disco ball. Fuck you

52:04.840 --> 52:06.840
Come on

52:06.840 --> 52:11.760
Shake blanket sack. What the fuck you talking about?

52:11.760 --> 52:14.200
You just ran into a Spencer's gifts with your arms outstretched

52:14.200 --> 52:18.060
You just knock some shit off the shelves into a basket and say go for it

52:18.680 --> 52:20.680
fucking horse apples a

52:21.760 --> 52:23.460
Frisbee a

52:23.460 --> 52:25.400
Frick if you sell

52:25.400 --> 52:31.040
65 boxes or more you get a fucking frisbee a butterfly

52:31.040 --> 52:39.000
carabiner for 90 they have placed a butterfly carabiner above a glow-in-the-dark flying disc fuck

52:40.760 --> 52:46.080
I do want to point out Travis that the gifts are really just a way to say thank you

52:46.080 --> 52:52.200
You're not buying the gifts what you're buying with this is the sense that you're helping a great organization fuck

52:52.200 --> 52:56.480
I'm not blind the gifts Justin. It's not about the gifts. You're too old

52:56.480 --> 53:01.720
You don't remember what it was like out there selling for daily on your church people. Oh

53:03.440 --> 53:10.540
This fucking sucks when I sold the most Vidalia onions choke. Why you know what I got $200 cash

53:14.480 --> 53:20.520
And it's just now as a 34 year old man hitting me is weird that you guys did sell onions

53:20.520 --> 53:26.900
I got I sold boxes of Vidalia onions the sweeter than an apple vegetable was the slogan very

53:27.120 --> 53:34.440
confusing not true either also not true and not not a fact not very sweet Vidalia onions and here's what they don't tell you

53:34.680 --> 53:41.520
when you sell the most boxes of Vidalia onions at one point you will have in your house a lot of

53:42.400 --> 53:47.240
Vidalia onions many onions. Yes, and then like a reverse loan shark

53:47.240 --> 53:52.560
You have to hunt down the people who gave you their names at some point and say hey

53:52.560 --> 53:57.680
Do you remember a month ago when I tricked you into buying a box of onions? It's your problem now

53:59.560 --> 54:03.720
Act on this my house smells like Shrek swamp, please

54:04.400 --> 54:12.160
And mom and dad load up the fucking Chrysler the Voyager with some boxes of stinky bitter apples

54:12.160 --> 54:18.680
We're gonna take him to church and hope that Judy will be there cuz she got ten of these motherfuckers

54:19.120 --> 54:24.520
For some reason and if she's not there bad news load him back up

54:25.840 --> 54:28.860
She definitely thought she was just buying ten onions

54:29.280 --> 54:34.800
Not ten boxes of onions, but that's fucking Judy's problem now now imagine if

54:35.440 --> 54:39.380
For all this work. I brought home an inflatable ottoman

54:39.380 --> 54:41.380
Oh

54:42.700 --> 54:46.820
The Girl Scouts figured out the game though like they have the cookies there

54:46.820 --> 54:52.000
And they're like you could be when I was a kid and I had to make money for band or whatever

54:53.220 --> 54:59.520
It was a really wild system where you would show up at someone's door, and you'd be like hey

55:00.260 --> 55:03.380
Do you like caramel turtles? They'd be like yeah?

55:05.460 --> 55:07.460
Do you want to eat some in six weeks

55:07.460 --> 55:13.940
I say I guess and then be like all right give me $20 what now yep?

55:13.940 --> 55:20.940
And I promise that I a child will definitely bring you this can I a child will bring it to you

55:20.940 --> 55:23.180
And then you say and then six

55:24.060 --> 55:27.760
Later which is I will say though adults if this does happen

55:28.020 --> 55:34.660
This is an amazing gift you could give to yourself because it is so rare that a child just walks up to your door

55:34.660 --> 55:39.060
They're like here's the candy like oh hell. Yeah, thanks past me

55:39.060 --> 55:45.020
I appreciate it, but it's a wild system like remember when you bought some caramel turtles from me. No absolutely not

55:45.700 --> 55:51.420
Died in the intervening six weeks, so I guess that these are my inheritance now

55:51.420 --> 55:53.580
Thank you very much the other system

55:53.580 --> 55:56.380
That was very broken was here is a box of candy bars

55:56.540 --> 56:02.020
You a 12 year old with no impulse control are now in charge of these candy bars

56:02.020 --> 56:07.060
And we expect you to sell all of them for $1 and what that translates to you is hey mom and dad

56:07.060 --> 56:13.820
I'm gonna need 30 bucks cuz I ate all of them because I'm a child and I was given a box of candy and no

56:14.180 --> 56:21.180
Oversight yeah, sorry. I would eat it in my profits constantly. Yeah, I got high on my own supply mom and dad

56:21.460 --> 56:27.900
Thanks so much for the 30 cold ones. It's crunching right into a fucking Vidalia onion like a iron chef does it?

56:27.900 --> 56:29.900
Oh

56:29.900 --> 56:34.000
Why to sell so many this stinky back you sold a lot of onions that trash

56:34.000 --> 56:38.900
I think that's a testament to your charisma that you sold a lot. It's a lot. It was a lot

56:38.900 --> 56:41.780
I I used every trick in the book

56:42.460 --> 56:44.460
Vidalia onion selling

56:44.820 --> 56:50.020
They did you guys are joking, but they do do this with like oranges. Yeah, you know wait. We're not juice

56:50.020 --> 56:52.020
We're not joking joking about onions

56:52.020 --> 56:59.620
Wait really I did that Bob. You did that. I thought you guys are having some fun. You were sweeter than an apple vegetable

56:59.860 --> 57:03.500
I sold like a hundred and twenty boxes

57:04.700 --> 57:09.580
They were stacked up in our dining room. How do you not they were next to the air-conditioner?

57:09.860 --> 57:15.300
So much funnier than it's real cuz I thought it was a joke for podcast and I thought was a little nice shit for

57:15.300 --> 57:20.660
My sensibilities you know to be like I would've been like fucking buy a case of sex dolls

57:20.660 --> 57:22.660
So the podcast

57:23.660 --> 57:31.420
Ribble I shared a bedroom with Travis during these trying times and it was like living is like sleeping inside of a Giants armpit

57:31.420 --> 57:33.180
It was tough stuff

57:33.180 --> 57:36.420
Especially after we had had some of those boxes for like a week

57:36.420 --> 57:39.620
And it was getting harder to track down some of these deadbeats

57:39.620 --> 57:40.900
And it was like hey

57:40.900 --> 57:47.500
I'm worried that by the time I get these onions to them the products gonna be just ruined and who's that on?

57:47.500 --> 57:52.380
Is that on me is that on them? Do I have to replace it? What is happening? Oh?

57:53.340 --> 57:59.900
We ate a lot of onions in those days. Yeah, let's let's scoot. Let's scoot. Yeah, let's scoot
