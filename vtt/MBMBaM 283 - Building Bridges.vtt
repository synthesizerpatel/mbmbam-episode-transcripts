00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:46.480 --> 00:53.840
Gotta get up, gotta get up. Hello, everybody, and welcome. My name is Soul Legend Desmond Carter,

00:53.840 --> 00:59.120
and you're listening to my brother, my brother, and me. It's 2016, basically.

00:59.120 --> 00:59.360
Nope.

00:59.360 --> 01:05.840
And you've joined us for the 2016 naming special. Let me introduce you to the brothers you have

01:05.840 --> 01:13.360
grown so accustomed to. First up is Justin McElroy. Hey, everybody, Justin here. Next up,

01:13.360 --> 01:16.960
we got Travis McElroy. Oh, didn't see you come in.

01:17.520 --> 01:22.080
Bringing the energy. Griffin McElroy, hit me. Hey, I didn't see you come in.

01:22.080 --> 01:25.520
Shit. You stole that line from your brother, but it's 2016, baby.

01:25.520 --> 01:26.640
Can I try again?

01:26.640 --> 01:27.920
Yeah. Hit me.

01:28.720 --> 01:29.280
Here I come.

01:31.280 --> 01:38.720
Very good high energy. Great special. So far, my brother, my brother, and me, every year,

01:38.720 --> 01:45.840
they have chosen a nickname for the year. 2012 was, of course, ZzZzZzZz.

01:45.840 --> 01:46.240
20 Does.

01:46.240 --> 01:50.080
Okay, 2010 was Zolo, correct?

01:51.520 --> 01:53.040
2010 was Zolo.

01:53.040 --> 01:56.080
I don't know if we ever officially announced that, but in my heart of hearts, of course,

01:56.080 --> 01:56.880
it was Zolo.

01:56.880 --> 01:58.800
I don't think they did 2011.

01:59.680 --> 02:02.560
That was Zole. We didn't know what we were doing.

02:02.560 --> 02:04.720
It took us a while to get good at naming things.

02:04.720 --> 02:11.200
Dark Lord Zole. 12 was 20 Does. Gettin' it in 20 Does, I believe was that one.

02:11.200 --> 02:17.440
Then in, of course, 2013 was 20 Dirt Teen. Digging up the dirt.

02:18.240 --> 02:19.280
2014.

02:21.280 --> 02:22.560
Was that 2014?

02:23.200 --> 02:30.160
I think it's 20 Squirt Teen. Nobody remembers. 2015 was, of course, 2015.

02:30.160 --> 02:38.640
Colon, the con, is on. They were pioneers in inventing the idea of coloning a word.

02:40.240 --> 02:42.240
I just want to throw that voice into the sun.

02:42.800 --> 02:50.000
Listen, one second, brothers. You paid me an exorbitant fee to be the emcee of tonight's

02:50.000 --> 02:52.720
proceedings to have you leave this place immediately.

02:52.720 --> 02:57.840
I just, I'm almost done with my intro. Then I've got a few songs for you.

02:57.840 --> 03:01.120
Okay, I am sick of this shit and you have to stop.

03:01.120 --> 03:03.680
It's making you, you are making me physically iller.

03:03.680 --> 03:08.800
I'm trying to pick up your slack, middle brother. Here we go. Almost done with the intro.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.880
Big finish. Let's start the show.

03:12.160 --> 03:14.480
That was a big, that was a big finish.

03:14.480 --> 03:16.480
Hey, so it's 2016.

03:16.480 --> 03:17.120
All right.

03:17.120 --> 03:18.480
We got to come up with a name for it.

03:18.480 --> 03:21.120
Can we review before we get to the naming ceremony,

03:21.120 --> 03:24.720
like how grifty we got in this, the year of the grift?

03:24.720 --> 03:28.160
We did a live show, a lot of live shows, and I feel like,

03:28.160 --> 03:33.120
I feel like tricking people into paying to watch us sit at a table and make gooses.

03:33.120 --> 03:34.480
Pretty grifty.

03:34.480 --> 03:37.760
That's true. And speaking of, thank you to everybody who came to our candlelight special

03:37.760 --> 03:39.520
in our beautiful hometown of Huntington, West Virginia.

03:39.520 --> 03:42.080
We made a lot of memories, but based on what I saw on Twitter,

03:42.080 --> 03:43.840
a lot of people made a lot of Huntington memories.

03:43.840 --> 03:47.200
And those are my favorite memories for people that obtain.

03:49.040 --> 03:52.640
We also had special guests, things I bought at Sheetz there.

03:52.640 --> 03:58.480
And I asked, I specially had my daddy ask everybody to film it, put on YouTube, and nobody did.

03:59.360 --> 04:01.120
So now it's a lost episode.

04:01.120 --> 04:08.080
If you were there, you got the lost episode of Things I Bought at Sheetz.

04:08.080 --> 04:12.080
And in case you're wondering, at the end of last week's episode,

04:13.120 --> 04:17.440
when I thanked the Druids, that's because during Things I Bought at Sheetz,

04:17.440 --> 04:18.800
there were Druids that kidnapped Dwight.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.000
I lost to time.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.680
You should not have explained that because that was maybe my favorite moment in any episode

04:23.680 --> 04:26.960
we've ever done where you just inexplicably thanked some Druids.

04:28.320 --> 04:31.600
But oh, we, to Tino's, that was the ultimate con, right?

04:31.600 --> 04:32.560
We've got them to pay us.

04:32.560 --> 04:35.120
I don't want to divulge numbers because according to our NDA,

04:35.120 --> 04:41.600
we can't put like $500,000 just to talk about how fucking tasty the little pizza pillows are.

04:43.760 --> 04:49.360
So should we decide what 2016 is going to be or each put out whatever our pitch is

04:49.360 --> 04:50.880
and then let the people decide?

04:50.880 --> 04:52.240
We don't need to gamify this shit.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.920
We don't have to have one each.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.360
This is like fucking jazz, baby.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.320
It's like a jazz baby.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.120
Let's just hit some ideas.

04:59.120 --> 04:59.440
All right.

04:59.440 --> 05:01.280
And then we'll see if we can even stick.

05:02.160 --> 05:03.760
20 flicks teen, catch up on that cue.

05:04.480 --> 05:05.760
Catch up on the cue, not bad.

05:05.760 --> 05:06.960
Let me hit you with this.

05:06.960 --> 05:08.640
This is a serious suggestion.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.880
2016, let's just get through it.

05:10.880 --> 05:11.680
Oh man, no.

05:11.680 --> 05:21.040
No, if you go into you're thinking, fuck, let's just get through this one year.

05:21.040 --> 05:23.040
And then some good things happen in it.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.920
You'll be like, whoa, not like you'll get to December and be like,

05:25.920 --> 05:27.840
ah, that's as bad as I thought it was going to be.

05:27.840 --> 05:28.560
Pretty good.

05:28.560 --> 05:32.080
But I feel like that's a little too negative for what we usually bring.

05:32.080 --> 05:32.880
Let me throw this out.

05:32.880 --> 05:33.760
This is my pitch.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.400
2016, building bridges.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.360
That is very good.

05:39.360 --> 05:40.720
What am I building bridges to?

05:40.720 --> 05:42.080
No, no, no, no, no, no.

05:42.080 --> 05:45.600
No, we're building a sex dummy of Jeff Bridges.

05:45.600 --> 05:46.480
Well, no, hold on.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.120
Wait, 2016, getting it.

05:49.680 --> 05:52.560
No, 2016, build a sex dummy of Jeff Bridges.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.000
It's a very specific goal.

05:54.560 --> 05:55.200
Yeah.

05:55.200 --> 05:58.240
But, and you're going to need to, I mean, a lot of these parts,

05:58.240 --> 05:59.600
they don't sell at the home Depot.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.280
Could you also do Todd Bridges?

06:04.880 --> 06:07.120
If that's more your speed, I don't see why not.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.120
That's the guy from Sequest, right?

06:09.120 --> 06:10.160
I think so.

06:10.160 --> 06:13.040
If you build a sex dummy of Jeff Bridges, what would it be called?

06:13.040 --> 06:15.280
Mine is dumb and hornier.

06:15.280 --> 06:16.800
So don't try to steal that one.

06:16.800 --> 06:17.440
That's pretty good.

06:19.280 --> 06:22.640
20, what other words sound like six?

06:22.640 --> 06:23.920
I mean, that's the root of this con-

06:23.920 --> 06:25.520
20 mixed teen, get up in it.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.520
20 mixed teen?

06:27.520 --> 06:28.720
Oh, get in the mix.

06:28.720 --> 06:28.960
Okay.

06:29.600 --> 06:30.800
What does that look like?

06:30.800 --> 06:31.760
Practically, what does that mean?

06:31.760 --> 06:33.200
Well, it's that idea of like, when you're like,

06:33.200 --> 06:36.800
oh, I want to join that group, but like, I'm afraid that I won't fit in.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.080
20 Dix teen.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.520
Okay.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.000
I'm just saying Dix rhymes with six.

06:42.000 --> 06:42.880
I don't really have a-

06:42.880 --> 06:44.560
Yours didn't seem as practical as mine did.

06:44.560 --> 06:47.200
No, there's no use case for 20 Dix teen, but-

06:47.760 --> 06:50.240
No, I don't think that that one is a fertile.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.760
We need something general, something universal.

06:53.760 --> 06:54.800
Let me hit you with this.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.040
20 Rix teen, where's all my Rix at?

06:59.040 --> 07:02.560
Yeah, this is just for reaching out specifically to Rix

07:02.560 --> 07:04.800
and Rix based listeners of this program.

07:04.800 --> 07:05.120
Yeah, sure.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.120
20 Rix teen, where are all my Rix at?

07:07.120 --> 07:11.200
So Rix, Richards, Rickeries, any like, variant.

07:11.760 --> 07:12.720
Yeah, all my Rix.

07:12.720 --> 07:13.600
Let me hear you.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.600
I had a math teacher named Rickery Smith.

07:16.640 --> 07:17.440
No, you didn't.

07:17.440 --> 07:17.840
I did.

07:17.840 --> 07:18.880
He taught me good math.

07:22.320 --> 07:25.280
20 Twix teen, get those caramel-y sons of bitches.

07:25.280 --> 07:25.920
I like that.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.360
20 Hix teen, back to your roots.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.120
I like back to your roots.

07:31.120 --> 07:31.920
I like the idea.

07:31.920 --> 07:36.080
Yeah, okay, let's start from the practical application

07:36.080 --> 07:38.240
and then work backwards to the word.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.280
Because right now we're just saying

07:39.280 --> 07:40.960
a bunch of gobbledygook garbage.

07:41.520 --> 07:45.600
And I want it to have a meaty thing.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.200
People this year were on their grift

07:47.200 --> 07:48.240
and that was because of us.

07:50.240 --> 07:52.400
I want there to be a use 20.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.960
What do we want people to do this year?

07:54.960 --> 07:56.320
Love one another.

07:56.320 --> 07:57.520
Just love one another.

07:58.320 --> 07:58.960
Hug more.

07:59.840 --> 08:00.400
Hug more.

08:00.400 --> 08:01.280
Hug more.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.560
Score lots of babes.

08:02.560 --> 08:03.600
20 chicks teen.

08:03.600 --> 08:04.080
No, Justin.

08:04.080 --> 08:04.960
Come on, ladies.

08:04.960 --> 08:07.040
Pile in this Lamborghini.

08:07.040 --> 08:07.600
Which one?

08:08.160 --> 08:08.880
This one.

08:08.880 --> 08:09.360
This one.

08:09.360 --> 08:10.560
No, not that one.

08:10.560 --> 08:11.840
That's not mine.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.200
Hop in the backseat, baby.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.040
There's no backseat.

08:15.040 --> 08:16.000
It's a Lambo.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.920
20 Pix teen, or it didn't count.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.040
You're like saying take lots of pictures?

08:21.040 --> 08:21.600
I guess.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.160
Right now I'm just trying to think of things

08:24.160 --> 08:25.440
that sound like six.

08:25.440 --> 08:26.160
Oh, yeah, yeah.

08:26.160 --> 08:27.680
Well, let me hit you with this then.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.680
20 Fricksteen.

08:29.680 --> 08:30.480
Hey, Hollywood.

08:30.480 --> 08:33.440
It's time to let Brenda Fricker back into movies.

08:34.720 --> 08:37.760
Listen, what she did, I'm not here to excuse it.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.040
It was heinous.

08:39.040 --> 08:41.440
What she did, it's inexcusable.

08:41.440 --> 08:42.400
But it's time.

08:42.400 --> 08:43.360
She served her time.

08:43.360 --> 08:45.280
And it's time to let her back into the picture.

08:45.280 --> 08:47.280
20 Fricksteen back in the picture.

08:50.320 --> 08:51.760
What about 20 Nix teen?

08:51.760 --> 08:52.720
Cut it out.

08:52.720 --> 08:54.160
Cut it out, Hollywood.

08:54.160 --> 08:54.880
Let her back in.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.840
Wait, I really like 20 Nix teen.

08:57.840 --> 09:00.800
20 Nix teen is like, just cut it out.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.320
Because everybody's got something

09:02.320 --> 09:03.840
that they just want to stop doing.

09:03.840 --> 09:04.880
And they always complain.

09:04.880 --> 09:06.320
Like, it's the thing that people are making.

09:06.320 --> 09:08.400
Like, I wish I could stop blank.

09:08.400 --> 09:09.440
You can.

09:09.440 --> 09:10.720
Yeah, there's Nix teen.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.080
It's time to stop.

09:12.080 --> 09:14.320
I like Nix teen too because it has other applications.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.880
For instance, if the basketball team, the Knickerbockers,

09:16.880 --> 09:18.000
do like a lot of good dunks

09:18.000 --> 09:19.840
and they win the basketball championship,

09:19.840 --> 09:21.760
then it can be like of the year,

09:21.760 --> 09:22.720
then be like, hey, we knew it.

09:22.720 --> 09:25.440
Also, I'm planning on getting very into Fleetwood Mac this year.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.200
So that would also work for me in that regard.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.000
Maybe you're a big fan of Richard Milhouse Nixon.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Yeah, another possibility.

09:32.000 --> 09:32.560
But wait a minute.

09:33.120 --> 09:35.600
The Nix, if it's 20 Nix teen,

09:35.600 --> 09:37.600
then you can get real into Mick Fleetwood.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.280
So you have a lot of different options

09:39.280 --> 09:40.560
regarding Fleetwood Mac.

09:40.560 --> 09:41.360
Well, this is great.

09:41.360 --> 09:44.320
We'll just keep it 20 Nix slash Nix teen,

09:44.320 --> 09:46.480
depending on what key you hit on the keyboard.

09:48.160 --> 09:50.240
I think I want people to chase their passions.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.080
That's what I want for this year.

09:52.080 --> 09:53.200
I've just decided.

09:53.200 --> 09:53.760
Okay.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.440
A lot of people are just sort of stuck in a rut

09:55.440 --> 09:56.480
doing their same thing,

09:56.480 --> 09:59.760
sort of suspending this thing that they want to do.

10:00.480 --> 10:03.200
Either some sort of creative vision,

10:03.200 --> 10:04.240
a romantic vision,

10:04.240 --> 10:06.640
whatever they know they're going to get to eventually.

10:06.640 --> 10:07.120
But guess what?

10:07.120 --> 10:08.320
You're putting it off a little too long.

10:09.840 --> 10:12.480
So I want people to really jump at it.

10:12.480 --> 10:12.720
Okay.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.480
Well, how do you translate that to a pun?

10:17.200 --> 10:17.920
What about this?

10:18.480 --> 10:19.680
20 Qix teen.

10:20.480 --> 10:22.160
Don't wait up.

10:22.160 --> 10:22.480
Wait.

10:22.480 --> 10:24.800
Oh, I thought you were going for like a Qixotic kind of thing.

10:24.800 --> 10:25.920
That could be it too.

10:26.480 --> 10:27.440
20 Qix teen.

10:27.440 --> 10:28.160
Don't wait up.

10:28.800 --> 10:31.280
It's all about like, stop delaying your shit.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.520
Mm-hmm.

10:33.520 --> 10:34.720
And move quickly.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.880
What about 20 Stix teen,

10:36.880 --> 10:39.360
appreciating the music of the world's greatest rock band?

10:39.360 --> 10:41.360
See, I feel like that's not as good.

10:41.360 --> 10:42.160
Okay.

10:42.560 --> 10:43.920
20 Thix teen.

10:43.920 --> 10:45.200
It's time we forget.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.120
No, it's not time we forgive Thicc.

10:47.120 --> 10:49.200
Thicc, you're still in the dog house, buddy.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.120
I think 20 Fix teen building bridges

10:51.120 --> 10:52.480
is probably as good as it's going to get.

10:52.480 --> 10:57.680
And I like the idea of coming back and doing something nice

10:57.680 --> 11:01.760
after this year, this selfish year of self-satisfaction

11:01.760 --> 11:04.880
at the expense of other people, like Totino's.

11:04.880 --> 11:07.840
We like to give all of Linear Time a narrative arc.

11:07.840 --> 11:08.160
Right.

11:08.160 --> 11:11.680
So this is, it just had sort of a dark turn, a heel turn.

11:11.680 --> 11:12.080
Mm-hmm.

11:12.080 --> 11:15.280
Now it's time to make a face turn, a positive year.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.840
So just like a sneak preview, what are you guys planning on?

11:17.840 --> 11:20.480
What bridges are you building personally?

11:20.480 --> 11:25.680
I've had a running feud with Elliot Kalin.

11:25.680 --> 11:27.680
I'm probably going to squash that beef.

11:28.240 --> 11:28.800
Over what?

11:30.240 --> 11:32.160
Well, I think he's the greatest.

11:32.160 --> 11:33.840
Okay, so that's a bad bridge.

11:33.840 --> 11:36.960
That's like, you have teleportation pads between you.

11:36.960 --> 11:38.320
You don't need a bridge, it sounds like.

11:38.320 --> 11:39.280
Okay, that's fair.

11:39.280 --> 11:40.080
Justin, bridge.

11:40.640 --> 11:41.760
Can I make a suggestion?

11:41.760 --> 11:46.240
Maybe this is the year that we finally patched things up

11:46.240 --> 11:46.960
with jugglers.

11:46.960 --> 11:53.120
Ooh, we've had a long sort of, it's been a rough few years

11:53.120 --> 11:58.400
between us and jugglers, but mainly because their hobby is...

11:59.120 --> 12:00.080
Ridiculous.

12:00.080 --> 12:00.800
It's ridiculous.

12:00.800 --> 12:03.760
Those things are supposed to be on the ground or on shelves,

12:03.760 --> 12:05.760
or you're supposed to hold one of them at a time,

12:05.760 --> 12:07.040
maybe two tops.

12:07.040 --> 12:10.240
It's only impressive to like feudal kings from hundreds of

12:10.240 --> 12:15.440
years ago, we have the internet now, and we have no need of you.

12:15.440 --> 12:18.320
That's the only problem with jugglers is that they're wasting

12:18.320 --> 12:21.600
their time and our time, and sometimes people get hurt

12:21.600 --> 12:22.400
with those things.

12:22.400 --> 12:26.480
Yeah, so that's been our stance so far.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.440
What I'm saying is like, maybe we just reach out to jugglers

12:29.440 --> 12:30.320
this year, just try to work it out.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.240
Well, it's not 2016 yet.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.360
Yeah, we still have two more days to just fucking hate

12:35.360 --> 12:36.080
those guys.

12:36.080 --> 12:39.360
I will say I see a path forward because I saw that YouTube

12:39.360 --> 12:42.160
video of that guy standing in a cone and like juggling shit

12:42.160 --> 12:43.760
like around the cone around himself.

12:43.760 --> 12:46.400
And I was like, all right.

12:47.040 --> 12:49.440
All right, I see what you're doing here.

12:49.440 --> 12:50.400
We can talk about that.

12:52.720 --> 12:53.760
We can figure something out here.

12:55.840 --> 12:59.280
You may have some place in the internet age yet, jugglers.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.440
So that guy, I guess, is going to be the keystone

13:01.440 --> 13:02.480
and my beautiful bridge.

13:03.920 --> 13:06.800
So if you're a juggler, maybe we could have like a juggler

13:06.800 --> 13:08.640
Gesper, who's like a sick juggler.

13:09.520 --> 13:10.800
I could reach out to cone guy.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.720
I'm sure there's a contact info out there somewhere.

13:12.720 --> 13:14.560
Problem is, I feel like, you know, he talks like,

13:17.760 --> 13:18.960
why would every juggler?

13:20.480 --> 13:21.680
Why do they all sound?

13:21.680 --> 13:23.360
Why do they sound like that, though?

13:23.360 --> 13:25.840
Are you a ball and another ball there?

13:25.840 --> 13:27.440
I can hold them all at once.

13:27.440 --> 13:27.940
Juggler.

13:28.800 --> 13:29.600
That's all they all sound.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.360
They do all say juggler a lot.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.040
They do say juggler.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.720
Juggler, do you juggly do?

13:34.720 --> 13:36.320
Now it's time for juggler.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.880
That's actually something I like if you move a muscle.

13:40.880 --> 13:43.200
Well, they start this little incantation.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.200
They're like, no way, come back.

13:45.200 --> 13:48.560
I worked real hard at this and I need you to ingest it.

13:48.560 --> 13:49.060
Yeah.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.560
Are they all kind of sick?

13:52.560 --> 13:56.320
What's going on with their actual tone and meter of their voice?

13:57.840 --> 14:01.200
Their approach to social interaction has become warped

14:01.200 --> 14:05.600
from hours, if not days, of hiding in a darkened room

14:05.600 --> 14:07.600
and throwing balls up in the air and catching them.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.800
So they've forgotten how people talk.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.000
Yeah, that makes sense, actually.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.920
Now that I think about it, let's do some advice

14:13.920 --> 14:16.320
now that we're down with 2016 building bridges.

14:18.160 --> 14:19.520
I'm just saying I like the theme we're going with,

14:19.520 --> 14:21.600
but if I do build a sex dummy of Jeff Bridges.

14:22.960 --> 14:25.920
That actually counts towards the original goal.

14:25.920 --> 14:26.420
Okay.

14:27.280 --> 14:30.480
If I use this sex dummy to cross a small gap.

14:30.480 --> 14:33.200
Well, actually, Jeff Bridges publicly stated the other day

14:33.200 --> 14:35.600
that he was sad that no one's ever made a sex dummy of him.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:36.720 --> 14:38.560
Well, I'm saying it would serve two functions.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.160
One, I would fuck the shit out of it.

14:40.160 --> 14:40.560
Yeah.

14:40.560 --> 14:42.560
Number two, I have a small creek in my backyard

14:42.560 --> 14:47.360
that I can lay him over and cross from one side to the other,

14:47.360 --> 14:48.400
cross the gap safely.

14:49.840 --> 14:50.400
So-

14:50.400 --> 14:52.080
Untouched by creek water.

14:52.080 --> 14:54.080
Travis, how do you feel, my friend?

14:54.080 --> 14:55.440
I feel like shit, Justin.

14:55.440 --> 14:56.560
Let's just do the show.

14:56.560 --> 14:57.680
I know, I'm just trying to be-

14:57.680 --> 14:59.040
I want to be honest about the conditions

14:59.040 --> 15:00.480
to earn ourselves some goodwill.

15:00.480 --> 15:00.720
Okay.

15:00.720 --> 15:01.760
This is true.

15:01.760 --> 15:04.960
There is a very good reason we weren't able to record on Monday.

15:04.960 --> 15:07.600
Yeah, and a good reason why this episode's probably gonna be pretty short

15:07.600 --> 15:10.640
is because we're all fucking just disintegrating.

15:10.640 --> 15:13.040
Yeah, and my baby has an incredibly high fever

15:13.040 --> 15:14.640
and has for eight days.

15:14.640 --> 15:15.040
Everything sucks.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.080
Like, I'm over it, baby.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.040
Let's help people.

15:17.040 --> 15:17.600
Help us.

15:18.160 --> 15:18.720
Fix us.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.360
I work in an office,

15:21.360 --> 15:22.960
which involves writing letters to people.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.520
Down the office, walk to coworker-

15:25.520 --> 15:27.280
Whoa, this is like a tense shift.

15:27.280 --> 15:28.880
I'm not used to these in the questions.

15:28.880 --> 15:29.360
Hell yeah.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.840
Down the office, walk to coworker who has her sexy so right.

15:33.840 --> 15:34.160
Oh, nice.

15:34.160 --> 15:35.520
And we made eye contact,

15:36.080 --> 15:38.400
as is polite under normal circumstances.

15:38.400 --> 15:38.960
Nope, nope, you're slipping.

15:38.960 --> 15:41.760
Thank you all for having me for this guess question.

15:41.760 --> 15:44.880
I did a little smile, however, this was wrong.

15:45.520 --> 15:48.720
At the time we made eye contact and I smiled,

15:48.720 --> 15:52.240
I happened to be licking an envelope to seal it shut.

15:52.240 --> 15:54.240
Oh, no.

15:54.240 --> 15:55.680
She looked terrified.

15:55.680 --> 15:56.960
Yes, correct.

15:56.960 --> 16:00.080
I think she may think I was smiling at the thought of licking her.

16:00.720 --> 16:01.840
2016?

16:01.840 --> 16:02.240
No.

16:02.240 --> 16:05.520
How do I convince her it was an accident and I'm not a creeper?

16:05.520 --> 16:09.760
That's from skeezy and salivating in Sheffield and the ship has sailed, my friend.

16:09.760 --> 16:10.320
Too late.

16:10.320 --> 16:14.240
Shit, I'm going to print this email out and put it in the garbage can.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.440
The garbage can.

16:15.440 --> 16:19.520
This is actually, I think, one of the examples shown in every HR video

16:19.520 --> 16:24.000
when you first get hired at any job of like what not to do.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.040
Please don't do this.

16:25.040 --> 16:29.200
I guess, fellas, I don't want to get blue here,

16:29.200 --> 16:33.600
but there's a very, there's a vitally important piece of information

16:33.600 --> 16:37.680
that we are lacking when trying to picture this image mentally.

16:37.680 --> 16:40.800
And that was, and again, I don't want to get blue,

16:40.800 --> 16:44.000
but what was the orientation of the envelope while you were licking it?

16:44.000 --> 16:47.120
Because if it was one way, I could write it off as an accident.

16:47.120 --> 16:48.960
But if it was the other way, was it an accident?

16:48.960 --> 16:50.960
You dirty bird, you dirty envelope bird.

16:51.840 --> 16:57.280
Yeah, I think that this is done.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.440
If you turnt that shit 90 degrees, I'm saying,

16:59.440 --> 17:02.400
and you have fucking cherry pie playing on Spotify,

17:04.720 --> 17:06.800
then I can't, it's inexcusable.

17:06.800 --> 17:10.640
And I'm going to put you in the fucking fricker jail because that sucks.

17:10.640 --> 17:12.880
That's no, that's no good.

17:12.880 --> 17:13.840
No good.

17:13.840 --> 17:15.120
Is it possible?

17:15.120 --> 17:19.680
Is there a chance that this moment registered with this woman

17:19.680 --> 17:21.040
and then it was gone?

17:22.640 --> 17:23.520
How do you mean?

17:23.520 --> 17:27.200
Like, she's not thinking about this nearly as much as the question, Oscar.

17:27.200 --> 17:30.160
That's, Travis, impossible because I want you

17:30.160 --> 17:34.720
and I want everybody listening to simulate this right now

17:34.720 --> 17:36.240
using their actual face, okay?

17:36.240 --> 17:38.080
I want you to pretend you're making eye contact with somebody,

17:38.080 --> 17:39.280
but this is the more important part.

17:39.280 --> 17:42.000
I want you to smile with your mouth

17:42.560 --> 17:45.200
and also try to lick something at the same time.

17:45.200 --> 17:45.840
Oops.

17:45.840 --> 17:46.880
Oh, yeah, you're right.

17:46.880 --> 17:48.480
Uh-oh, you look like venom.

17:48.480 --> 17:50.800
No, you done fucked up real, real bad.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.640
Oops-a-daisy, you look like venom.

17:52.640 --> 17:56.720
The problem here is that you can't go talk to her now and be like,

17:56.720 --> 18:00.320
hey, yesterday when I was licking the envelope,

18:00.320 --> 18:02.400
I wasn't thinking about you or anything.

18:02.400 --> 18:06.080
Like, there is nothing you can say to make it less creepy.

18:06.880 --> 18:08.480
You will only make it more creepy.

18:08.480 --> 18:11.120
Yeah, I mean, unfortunately, there's nothing we can do for you

18:11.120 --> 18:13.520
at this moment except to just sort of like,

18:13.520 --> 18:16.400
I can pass on my personal sort of style,

18:17.040 --> 18:18.960
which is all of this could have been avoided,

18:18.960 --> 18:21.440
or at least mostly avoided if you just hadn't made eye contact.

18:21.440 --> 18:23.200
If you just hadn't made eye contact with her

18:23.200 --> 18:24.960
or anybody else for the rest of your life.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.720
Why were you trying to make eye contact with people

18:26.720 --> 18:27.920
while licking an envelope?

18:27.920 --> 18:29.440
Your eyes should be down.

18:29.440 --> 18:30.400
Right, that's bad in the first place,

18:30.400 --> 18:32.000
but your eyes should always be down no matter what,

18:32.000 --> 18:34.240
because then you still would have been doing that crazy thing

18:34.240 --> 18:35.840
with your mouth, and I hate that.

18:35.840 --> 18:38.240
But at least you wouldn't have been like fucking nose scoping

18:38.240 --> 18:39.360
at this woman.

18:40.960 --> 18:43.760
Are we agreed that like, I've been racking my brain.

18:43.760 --> 18:44.960
I have nothing.

18:44.960 --> 18:46.080
You're hosed, right?

18:46.080 --> 18:48.720
You gotta like brush up your resume.

18:48.720 --> 18:51.520
Okay, you should be happy you still have a job.

18:51.520 --> 18:51.920
Yeah.

18:51.920 --> 18:55.360
Forget trying to salvage a relationship with this person.

18:55.360 --> 18:56.480
You're employed.

18:56.480 --> 18:57.120
Yeah, it's bad.

18:57.840 --> 18:59.040
It's not great.

18:59.040 --> 19:00.080
It's not great though.

19:00.080 --> 19:02.720
It's not a great, like the whole situation's pretty bad.

19:02.720 --> 19:04.560
What you gotta do is you gotta lean into it.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.120
Uh oh.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.800
And the next time she comes back down the hallway,

19:06.800 --> 19:09.040
grab the closest envelope, go to town.

19:09.040 --> 19:09.280
Yeah.

19:10.560 --> 19:10.880
God.

19:12.880 --> 19:15.680
Then you can just try to convince her that you have pica,

19:15.680 --> 19:18.720
and you need like some of the nutrients in there

19:19.760 --> 19:24.320
to be able to function as a person.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.840
Do you guys think, how much money would you pay me

19:27.840 --> 19:33.360
if as a dare, I licked envelopes at a 90 degree angle

19:33.360 --> 19:34.400
for a whole year?

19:34.400 --> 19:36.000
I guess it wouldn't matter because I work from home.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.440
It's not like anybody would observe the act.

19:37.440 --> 19:39.040
But what if I went to the post office every day

19:39.040 --> 19:42.880
and did it in like face to face with the post office employees?

19:43.680 --> 19:44.400
And I was just like, what?

19:44.400 --> 19:46.480
That's how I make sure they get real good and sealed up.

19:48.080 --> 19:49.280
This is how I seal my packages.

19:49.280 --> 19:50.080
I don't know.

19:50.080 --> 19:51.680
I wouldn't pay you to do that.

19:52.320 --> 19:52.960
Yeah.

19:52.960 --> 19:54.560
It'd be like, I love you.

19:54.560 --> 19:54.720
Yeah.

19:54.720 --> 19:57.920
But it'd be like a fun, like wild boys stunt.

19:57.920 --> 19:58.960
No, it sounds terrible.

19:58.960 --> 20:01.120
It sounds mean to the post office employees.

20:01.120 --> 20:01.680
I guess so.

20:01.680 --> 20:02.960
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

20:02.960 --> 20:03.840
Yes, please.

20:03.840 --> 20:06.080
And sent in by Zoe Kinski climbing that ladder.

20:06.080 --> 20:06.720
Zoe Kinski.

20:07.280 --> 20:11.440
She posted in the MBM appreciation group on Facebook,

20:11.440 --> 20:12.320
which is a great group.

20:12.320 --> 20:13.360
If you're not a member of it,

20:13.360 --> 20:16.240
they did a candle night secret Santa exchange.

20:16.240 --> 20:18.640
And she posted, she got a custom made shirt

20:18.640 --> 20:20.160
that says climbing that ladder on it,

20:20.160 --> 20:21.360
which made me very happy.

20:21.360 --> 20:21.760
That's cool.

20:21.760 --> 20:22.320
Yeah.

20:22.320 --> 20:22.800
Thank you, Zoe.

20:22.800 --> 20:25.360
It's by Yahoo Answers user Andres, who asks,

20:27.200 --> 20:28.880
does dressing up as Tommy Pickles

20:28.880 --> 20:30.960
get you a five day suspension from school?

20:32.560 --> 20:33.200
What?

20:33.200 --> 20:35.600
In my high school, we have things called spirit.

20:35.600 --> 20:36.560
Oh no.

20:36.560 --> 20:38.880
In my high school, we have things called, sorry.

20:38.880 --> 20:41.920
In my high school, he have things called spirit weeks.

20:41.920 --> 20:43.440
Where based on what the theme is,

20:43.440 --> 20:46.400
the students come dressed as said theme for spirit points.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.400
And whichever class gets the most points

20:48.400 --> 20:50.880
wings a free trip to King's Dominion.

20:52.080 --> 20:53.360
That's pretty sweet.

20:53.360 --> 20:54.880
Yeah, that's actually pretty dope.

20:54.880 --> 20:58.960
Apparently on a Thursday seniors had to go as 90s Nickelodeon.

20:58.960 --> 21:00.560
I went as Tommy Pickles.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.360
During lunchtime, I got up and walked over to the table

21:03.360 --> 21:04.640
with the singing sheets.

21:05.200 --> 21:06.320
Sign in sheets?

21:06.320 --> 21:06.960
What?

21:06.960 --> 21:09.920
I like singing sheets because it makes their whole school

21:09.920 --> 21:11.760
sound like an Arthurian legend.

21:11.760 --> 21:12.000
Yeah.

21:13.120 --> 21:16.160
Since I was wearing only adult diapers and a blue shirt,

21:16.160 --> 21:17.680
the whole cafeteria saw that.

21:17.680 --> 21:22.320
And the principal that gets me a five day suspension.

21:22.320 --> 21:24.480
Everyone keeps saying the punishment was too rash

21:24.480 --> 21:25.200
and so do I.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.640
So I ask, is it?

21:26.640 --> 21:28.640
PS, I didn't come to school in diapers.

21:28.640 --> 21:30.240
I changed in a nearby bathroom.

21:30.240 --> 21:32.640
Everyone is saying it was a first time dress code violation,

21:32.640 --> 21:34.000
which results in a warning

21:34.000 --> 21:35.520
and to be sent home for the rest of the day.

21:36.480 --> 21:39.280
Okay, he says everyone saw that.

21:39.280 --> 21:40.720
He means his balls and penis, right?

21:40.720 --> 21:42.880
Yeah, he pulled out his whole penis

21:42.880 --> 21:45.360
and both his big juicy balls.

21:47.200 --> 21:50.560
Listen, I understand that this is a first time dress code

21:50.560 --> 21:54.000
violation and I am admittedly not someone

21:54.000 --> 21:58.720
who is overseeing your school in a rules fashion.

21:59.920 --> 22:01.760
You can violate the dress code.

22:01.760 --> 22:03.360
There are violations of dress code

22:03.360 --> 22:05.280
and then they're showing up in an adult diaper.

22:05.280 --> 22:05.600
Yeah.

22:05.600 --> 22:08.800
Like you don't get off with a warning for that.

22:08.800 --> 22:12.880
Like that implies that you were somehow misled

22:12.880 --> 22:14.800
about the specifics of the dress code.

22:14.800 --> 22:18.320
Well, a bigger problem is he made it to lunch

22:18.320 --> 22:19.920
before he got in trouble.

22:19.920 --> 22:20.640
That's, yeah.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.080
Well, he had a big audience there

22:22.080 --> 22:24.000
and you know this motherfucker was putting on a show.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.200
But Justin has a great point.

22:25.200 --> 22:27.280
It's not like everybody gets one free pass

22:27.280 --> 22:29.280
to get out their dick and balls or vagina

22:29.280 --> 22:31.520
and then be like, oops, that's my one.

22:31.520 --> 22:32.880
I'll go put my pants on.

22:32.880 --> 22:36.320
Like, no, there's some violations are so severe

22:36.320 --> 22:39.200
that you have to be given the maximum punishment.

22:39.200 --> 22:40.880
Like right away.

22:40.880 --> 22:41.360
Right away.

22:42.000 --> 22:42.960
By which I mean death.

22:44.160 --> 22:46.160
You have to be, wait, you have to be killed?

22:46.160 --> 22:46.960
No, sorry.

22:46.960 --> 22:49.200
Yes, maybe a wolf school.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.720
By the singing sheets.

22:50.720 --> 22:53.200
Singing sheets, they spirit your soul away.

22:53.200 --> 22:57.200
You must march through the singing sheets into wolf school.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.320
It's really bad in there.

23:00.720 --> 23:00.960
Okay.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.200
Why do they kill you in wolf school?

23:03.200 --> 23:04.240
I don't know.

23:04.240 --> 23:07.840
But why have his teachers failed him so badly?

23:07.840 --> 23:11.680
Why have all the other people, are they just afraid?

23:11.680 --> 23:12.400
Whoa.

23:12.400 --> 23:13.040
Well.

23:13.040 --> 23:17.200
Did he just, did he just intimidate

23:17.200 --> 23:19.920
an entire school of people into submission

23:20.560 --> 23:22.000
by wearing a diaper?

23:22.560 --> 23:22.960
Was that like such-

23:22.960 --> 23:25.280
You mean like it was so intense they couldn't handle it,

23:25.280 --> 23:25.440
they had to remove them?

23:25.440 --> 23:27.840
Such a big move that he made?

23:28.880 --> 23:30.480
It made such a big move.

23:30.480 --> 23:31.520
That's way too cool.

23:31.520 --> 23:32.640
Get him out of here.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.000
My favorite thing about this story is like,

23:34.000 --> 23:37.040
the Rudy-esque like collabo that all the other,

23:37.040 --> 23:39.040
the whole rest of the student body is doing,

23:39.040 --> 23:39.920
where they are like,

23:40.560 --> 23:42.160
I don't know, Mr. Adkins,

23:42.160 --> 23:44.240
that punishment seems really harsh.

23:44.240 --> 23:45.840
This one's for Tommy Pickles.

23:46.400 --> 23:48.400
If he's suspended, I'm suspended too.

23:48.400 --> 23:49.200
Walk out, gang.

23:49.200 --> 23:50.000
We're having a walk out.

23:50.000 --> 23:50.480
Because high school-

23:50.480 --> 23:51.520
We're having a crawl out.

23:51.520 --> 23:51.760
Yeah.

23:51.760 --> 23:54.880
High schoolers need like no reason to have a walk out.

23:54.880 --> 23:56.160
It's like, yeah, we'll protest.

23:56.160 --> 23:57.120
What are we protesting?

23:57.120 --> 23:57.600
Whatever.

23:57.600 --> 23:58.800
We all are leaving school, right?

23:58.800 --> 23:59.760
They can't punish all of us.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.400
Or they all show up the next day

24:02.400 --> 24:04.240
in diapers.

24:04.240 --> 24:05.840
In diapers, yeah.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.040
Also, I love that idea.

24:07.040 --> 24:09.280
I think there are a couple different times at Huntington High

24:09.280 --> 24:10.560
where someone tried to like,

24:11.200 --> 24:12.960
encourage everyone to do a walk out

24:12.960 --> 24:14.800
and dude, like they can't punish all of us.

24:14.800 --> 24:15.600
And now looking back,

24:15.600 --> 24:19.120
all I can think is if I were like a high school staff member

24:19.680 --> 24:22.160
and all the kids just weren't there one day,

24:22.800 --> 24:24.800
but I was still there getting paid,

24:24.800 --> 24:26.640
that would be like the best day.

24:26.640 --> 24:27.280
Yeah.

24:27.280 --> 24:28.720
I would just get drunk.

24:28.720 --> 24:30.320
That would be like a top-notch day.

24:30.320 --> 24:33.280
I would get drunker than I usually am on a given school day.

24:33.280 --> 24:34.160
That would be a great day,

24:34.160 --> 24:36.800
except you're still like legally on the hook

24:36.800 --> 24:38.800
for whatever happens to those kids.

24:38.800 --> 24:40.240
I don't think that's how that works.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.120
No, that's not true.

24:41.120 --> 24:42.880
Like if a kid stays home sick,

24:42.880 --> 24:44.800
you don't have to like go down and make sure

24:44.800 --> 24:46.480
that they don't like rob somebody.

24:46.480 --> 24:47.120
That's different.

24:47.120 --> 24:47.920
They're playing hooky.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.120
Their parents think they're at school.

24:49.120 --> 24:52.320
You think they're, you know, at home,

24:53.040 --> 24:54.640
you're on the hook for that as a school.

24:54.640 --> 24:57.280
What if there was a school-wide walk out

24:57.280 --> 25:01.040
and also a zoo-wide bear walk out

25:01.040 --> 25:04.400
and all the bears left the zoo at the same time,

25:04.400 --> 25:05.440
the students all left,

25:05.440 --> 25:07.520
and then the two groups met in the middle.

25:07.520 --> 25:09.120
Who's on the hook for that, I ask you.

25:09.120 --> 25:11.200
Yeah, that's a good point, Justin.

25:11.200 --> 25:13.360
I'm gonna read the best answer on this

25:14.240 --> 25:16.320
is a Yahoo Answers user

25:16.320 --> 25:20.640
and fucking legal expert father who responds.

25:20.640 --> 25:23.440
This is kind of tough, but honestly, the answer is yes.

25:23.440 --> 25:24.160
Think about it.

25:24.160 --> 25:25.440
You essentially came to school

25:25.440 --> 25:28.000
in nothing but underwear and a t-shirt.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.920
You really should have used a little foresight,

25:29.920 --> 25:32.720
like wearing pants underneath or at least a pair of shorts.

25:32.720 --> 25:33.760
Hi, father.

25:33.760 --> 25:34.480
Hi, daddy.

25:35.680 --> 25:39.440
Have you seen the Nickelodeon television program, Rugrats?

25:39.440 --> 25:40.880
Because what you just said is crazy.

25:40.880 --> 25:42.560
Tommy, what are you wearing?

25:42.560 --> 25:44.080
These are pants.

25:44.080 --> 25:45.120
I wear pants now.

25:45.120 --> 25:47.920
There's a little thing called artistic pride.

25:47.920 --> 25:50.240
Yeah, you're wearing pants under your diaper?

25:50.240 --> 25:51.280
That's crazy.

25:51.280 --> 25:54.800
If you wear, if you're wearing shorts under your diaper

25:54.800 --> 25:57.040
and a blue shirt, you're nothing.

25:57.040 --> 25:58.560
You look like a crazy person.

25:58.560 --> 26:01.280
Yeah, and you certainly don't have spirit.

26:01.280 --> 26:04.080
By this person just having like a little bit of cloth

26:04.080 --> 26:07.360
in between their juicy balls in the whole world, that's art.

26:07.360 --> 26:09.360
That's Banksy, basically, is what I'm saying.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.200
Yeah, that's how Banksy got started.

26:11.200 --> 26:12.640
That's how he got his start.

26:12.640 --> 26:14.320
That's how Banksy got his groove back.

26:14.320 --> 26:16.880
Uh-huh, he's done it twice.

26:16.880 --> 26:17.760
How about another question?

26:18.480 --> 26:20.720
Over the holidays, a lot of people brought in baked goods

26:20.720 --> 26:24.320
to work for everyone to enjoy while eating a cookie.

26:24.320 --> 26:27.120
You don't need to brag, get braggy about it.

26:27.120 --> 26:29.840
While eating a cookie made by one of my co-workers,

26:29.840 --> 26:31.760
I felt something hard in my mouth.

26:31.760 --> 26:32.880
After rooting around a bit,

26:32.880 --> 26:35.760
I found an ordinary household staple

26:35.760 --> 26:40.080
and not a staple like rice or grain, but an actual staple.

26:41.520 --> 26:44.160
Long story short, I told the person who made the cookies

26:44.160 --> 26:46.160
and now almost everyone in the office knows.

26:46.160 --> 26:48.320
My conundrum was this, was I right to tell her?

26:48.320 --> 26:50.480
It's not like she could do anything about it after the fact

26:50.480 --> 26:52.080
and she didn't throw away the rest of the cookies

26:52.080 --> 26:52.960
or even remove them.

26:52.960 --> 26:54.560
What the fuck?

26:54.560 --> 26:55.920
That's from cookie conundrum.

26:55.920 --> 26:58.400
You're good, they're not, that sucks.

26:58.400 --> 27:00.560
Right, as you read the question, you get to the part

27:00.560 --> 27:01.760
where it's like everyone in the office knows,

27:01.760 --> 27:03.120
you're like, oh, how embarrassing.

27:03.120 --> 27:04.960
And then you get to the part where the person who made them

27:04.960 --> 27:06.800
said, uh-huh, yeah, what do you want me to do?

27:06.800 --> 27:09.040
And didn't like move the cookies

27:09.040 --> 27:10.400
or throw them away or anything.

27:10.400 --> 27:12.960
And it's like, oh, she put that staple in there

27:12.960 --> 27:14.240
because she hates you, Derek.

27:14.240 --> 27:16.160
It's not, no, that's not addressed.

27:16.160 --> 27:18.320
Like the person who made the cookies

27:18.320 --> 27:21.360
may have taken a tin of them and tossed them in the trash.

27:21.360 --> 27:24.480
No, he says that there, she didn't throw away

27:24.480 --> 27:26.240
the rest of the cookies or even remove them.

27:26.240 --> 27:28.400
Yeah, homie, it literally says that exact thing

27:28.400 --> 27:29.520
you just said it didn't say.

27:30.560 --> 27:32.160
Oh, okay, yeah, I see that now.

27:32.160 --> 27:33.200
Who read the question?

27:33.200 --> 27:34.320
I guess I just wasn't paying attention.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.160
This person's the history's greatest monster.

27:36.160 --> 27:37.840
This is the worst, are you kidding me?

27:37.840 --> 27:39.760
If I go to Arby's right now and I bite into one

27:39.760 --> 27:42.880
of their big, big buffalos, their big Beauforts,

27:42.880 --> 27:44.160
and I chomp down on one of those

27:44.160 --> 27:46.800
and I pull a fucking staple or any foreign object

27:46.800 --> 27:49.280
out of my mouth, they legally have to get rid

27:49.280 --> 27:51.200
of all of the sliced meat in the building.

27:51.200 --> 27:53.040
Yeah, like your day is made though.

27:53.040 --> 27:55.520
Like, cause after that, cause you got them on the hook.

27:55.520 --> 27:56.560
Yeah, I got free beef for life,

27:56.560 --> 27:58.000
but that doesn't apply here.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.760
It's not gonna be like, Linda, you gotta cook me cookies

27:59.760 --> 28:00.640
for the rest of my life.

28:00.640 --> 28:02.960
This is a fucking wookie life bond.

28:02.960 --> 28:05.280
I almost died because of your dumb staple cookie.

28:05.280 --> 28:07.360
Now I need cookies hot and fresh,

28:07.360 --> 28:09.280
two of them sitting on my desk every morn.

28:09.280 --> 28:13.600
I completely disagree with telling about the staple.

28:13.600 --> 28:14.480
Completely disagree.

28:14.480 --> 28:16.320
Was that just because you would not do it?

28:16.320 --> 28:20.640
No, it's, okay, think about it this way, okay?

28:20.640 --> 28:24.560
One option is you don't say anything

28:24.560 --> 28:25.840
and they did something, you know,

28:25.840 --> 28:26.960
they're trying to do something nice.

28:27.600 --> 28:30.880
Maybe they were, maybe they're a little bit slow

28:30.880 --> 28:34.000
or in their twilight years, they're not as like observant

28:34.000 --> 28:35.840
as they used to be and they accidentally left a staple

28:35.840 --> 28:36.320
in there.

28:36.320 --> 28:38.160
We all have staples on our clothes.

28:38.160 --> 28:39.440
You find them from time to time.

28:39.440 --> 28:40.240
Hold up, what?

28:41.120 --> 28:42.000
We all have fine staples on our clothes.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.960
You know, when you get bored and you stable your shirt,

28:44.960 --> 28:45.760
you know.

28:45.760 --> 28:47.280
When you accidentally put a staple.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.360
You could have just thrown away that staple.

28:51.360 --> 28:52.480
They would have felt good.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.560
You would have felt morally vindicated

28:54.560 --> 28:56.000
like you did a nice thing for somebody

28:56.000 --> 28:57.600
and had their back for once

28:57.600 --> 28:59.040
and that would have been great.

28:59.040 --> 29:01.440
The alternate, because the alternate concept

29:01.440 --> 29:02.400
is that you need to tell them

29:02.400 --> 29:06.400
because they have dumped many, many staples into it.

29:06.400 --> 29:08.960
And if they did that, they know they did

29:08.960 --> 29:09.840
and they don't care.

29:10.480 --> 29:11.760
They know the jig is up

29:11.760 --> 29:13.840
once everybody starts tearing up these cookies.

29:13.840 --> 29:15.600
The fact they almost killed you.

29:15.600 --> 29:16.720
If it's late at night

29:16.720 --> 29:19.680
and you're walking down the county road.

29:19.680 --> 29:20.400
They did it.

29:20.400 --> 29:20.560
Nope.

29:20.560 --> 29:22.480
We're all almost killing each other constantly.

29:22.480 --> 29:23.200
Please, please.

29:23.200 --> 29:25.040
You're walking down that county road at night

29:25.040 --> 29:26.400
just trying to fucking clear your head

29:26.400 --> 29:29.040
because you just got in a big fight with your sister

29:29.040 --> 29:30.320
and you're just walking down that road.

29:30.320 --> 29:31.680
Oh, damn it.

29:32.800 --> 29:35.280
Linda, not again.

29:35.280 --> 29:36.000
Not like this.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.760
Then all of a sudden, who's that over the hill?

29:37.760 --> 29:39.680
It's Barbara, your coworker

29:39.680 --> 29:41.520
and she hits you with her car and drives off.

29:41.520 --> 29:42.480
Oh, she got scared.

29:42.480 --> 29:43.600
It could happen to anybody.

29:43.600 --> 29:44.080
What's that?

29:44.080 --> 29:44.800
You survived.

29:44.800 --> 29:47.440
You're nursed back to health by a family of wolves

29:47.440 --> 29:49.040
on vacation from wolf school.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.240
And then what's that?

29:50.240 --> 29:52.160
You come back into the office two days later

29:52.160 --> 29:54.480
a little banged up, but still alive.

29:54.480 --> 29:55.920
You wouldn't go to Barbara and be like,

29:55.920 --> 29:58.320
hey, B, what the fuck?

29:58.320 --> 30:00.720
You almost kill me with your car out on the county road.

30:00.720 --> 30:02.960
You're suggesting you just let bygones be bygones

30:02.960 --> 30:04.960
because we've all hit somebody on the county road

30:04.960 --> 30:05.600
late at night.

30:05.600 --> 30:06.960
That's nothing to do.

30:06.960 --> 30:08.480
The two situations are completely different.

30:08.480 --> 30:10.400
No, I think that tracks.

30:10.400 --> 30:11.920
I think that's absolutely correct.

30:11.920 --> 30:12.640
Thank you, Travis.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.320
It's attempted murder is what it is.

30:14.320 --> 30:16.640
Even if it's accidental, you still attempted it.

30:16.640 --> 30:21.680
I think there's precedent that almost eating a stable

30:21.680 --> 30:23.920
and getting hit by a car and driving off

30:24.560 --> 30:26.240
are basically in the same wheelhouse.

30:26.240 --> 30:29.280
Now, I'm not going to say that it's the same severity,

30:29.280 --> 30:30.640
but they're definitely related.

30:30.640 --> 30:31.600
I'm going to say that.

30:31.600 --> 30:33.280
The defense rests, your honor.

30:33.840 --> 30:35.120
There's another option here.

30:35.120 --> 30:36.880
What if you went up to Barbara and you're like,

30:36.880 --> 30:41.840
Barbara, I found a staple in the cookie.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.640
And she went, that mischievous ghost.

30:45.440 --> 30:47.760
And there was just a ghost dumping staples

30:47.760 --> 30:48.480
into the cookies.

30:49.040 --> 30:50.000
Is it just staple?

30:50.000 --> 30:53.120
That seems like a really specific form of haunting.

30:54.400 --> 30:57.280
Does it dump dice in there occasionally?

30:57.280 --> 30:58.160
What's it?

30:58.160 --> 31:00.800
Well, he's more of a Harlequin figure.

31:00.800 --> 31:03.680
He's just stirring up the pot and creating trouble,

31:06.000 --> 31:06.800
wreaking havoc.

31:06.800 --> 31:09.200
You're saying, but staple-based havoc.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.680
Well, you use what you've got access to,

31:11.680 --> 31:13.760
and Barbara's been stealing office supplies.

31:13.760 --> 31:14.640
That makes sense, actually.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.480
And he has thin, reedy arms,

31:16.480 --> 31:18.160
so he can't lift a lot of things

31:18.160 --> 31:19.040
that what would normally cause trouble.

31:19.040 --> 31:19.600
Yeah, what's he going to do?

31:19.600 --> 31:20.640
Put a printer in there?

31:20.640 --> 31:21.040
Come on.

31:21.040 --> 31:22.160
Absolutely not.

31:22.160 --> 31:24.080
Barbara stole a fucking printer?

31:24.080 --> 31:26.000
Well, Barbara's got sticky fingers.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.240
Yeah, but fucking crime of the century.

31:28.240 --> 31:29.280
That's incredible.

31:29.280 --> 31:30.560
How does she even get out?

31:30.560 --> 31:33.200
What if Barbara, where Barbara comes from,

31:33.840 --> 31:35.520
that's a very lucky thing.

31:35.520 --> 31:37.360
That's how I would play it if I was Barbara.

31:37.360 --> 31:38.160
Oh, like finding the page?

31:38.160 --> 31:40.560
Oh, like finding the baby and the king cake.

31:40.560 --> 31:42.560
You found Ungunther's staple.

31:42.560 --> 31:45.040
That's the one lucky staple,

31:45.040 --> 31:47.360
is how it loosely translates for my people.

31:47.360 --> 31:50.960
And you'll have good fortune all throughout the year.

31:51.600 --> 31:53.680
And then they raised him up on his shoulders

31:53.680 --> 31:56.560
and mired his broken teeth.

31:56.560 --> 31:57.840
Good news, everybody.

31:57.840 --> 31:59.520
Rick found the Ungunther's staple.

32:00.560 --> 32:03.440
Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick.

32:03.440 --> 32:05.760
Oh shit, we got to take Rick to the hospital.

32:05.760 --> 32:08.480
He's too lucky.

32:08.480 --> 32:10.000
Luck is bleeding from his face.

32:11.760 --> 32:13.040
Let's go to the money zone.

32:13.040 --> 32:15.040
Hell yeah.

32:24.640 --> 32:27.760
Many problems that you experience in your day to day

32:28.720 --> 32:29.440
start in your head.

32:30.080 --> 32:31.200
It doesn't feel that way.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.840
It feels sometimes like they start in your gut or your butt,

32:33.840 --> 32:34.400
but it's not.

32:34.400 --> 32:34.960
It's your head.

32:34.960 --> 32:39.040
Fear, anger, stress, anxiety, depression.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.640
All these leads to the dark side.

32:40.640 --> 32:42.080
All these leads to the dark side.

32:43.120 --> 32:44.320
How do you stay on the light side?

32:44.320 --> 32:45.040
Headspace.

32:45.040 --> 32:48.160
It's meditation made simple.

32:48.160 --> 32:49.840
These are guided meditations you can listen to

32:49.840 --> 32:51.280
whenever you want, wherever you want,

32:51.280 --> 32:54.960
right on your phone, computer, or tablet.

32:55.600 --> 32:57.680
And let me say, I've been doing meditation

32:58.560 --> 33:00.160
for almost a decade now.

33:00.160 --> 33:01.440
Thanks, Tim Allen.

33:01.440 --> 33:02.560
Thanks, Tim Allen.

33:02.560 --> 33:06.160
And what I really, really like about Headspace

33:06.160 --> 33:07.680
is it's very user friendly.

33:07.680 --> 33:09.440
Even if you're the type of person who's like,

33:09.440 --> 33:11.120
I don't know if I could sit still for that long.

33:11.120 --> 33:12.320
I don't know if I could get into it.

33:13.120 --> 33:18.400
It's so well guided, but not in an obtrusive way.

33:18.400 --> 33:20.320
It's very easy to get into.

33:20.320 --> 33:23.040
I'm a huge proponent of meditation, generally speaking,

33:23.040 --> 33:25.600
but also Headspace specifically.

33:25.600 --> 33:29.440
I was using Headspace before they reached out to us

33:29.440 --> 33:31.040
about advertising on the show.

33:31.040 --> 33:33.200
So I was really, really excited to have an excuse

33:33.200 --> 33:34.640
to talk about them.

33:34.640 --> 33:38.000
Meditation, in general, I think is something

33:38.000 --> 33:39.760
that a lot of people could use in their lives.

33:39.760 --> 33:41.680
And Headspace makes it really easy.

33:41.680 --> 33:44.080
They have this starter program that you can download

33:45.120 --> 33:46.960
on their Headspace app for free.

33:46.960 --> 33:48.240
And it's a take 10 program.

33:48.240 --> 33:50.880
It's 10 days of guided meditation.

33:50.880 --> 33:54.560
If you could just go to headspace.com slash my brother

33:55.200 --> 33:56.960
and you can get all the details there.

33:57.680 --> 33:59.840
I guarantee this is, you know,

33:59.840 --> 34:01.360
I don't say this with a lot of advertisers

34:01.360 --> 34:03.360
or a lot of things in anything.

34:03.360 --> 34:05.360
This could legitimately change your life.

34:05.360 --> 34:07.440
If you've been hearing people talk about meditation,

34:07.440 --> 34:08.640
this is a killer way to get started.

34:08.640 --> 34:13.120
Now, Travis has authored a guest guided meditation program

34:13.760 --> 34:15.280
as part of this starter bundle.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.600
And it is Tim Allen themed.

34:17.600 --> 34:19.280
I know you're wondering, is it Tim Allen themed?

34:19.280 --> 34:20.880
Would you like to hear a clip of it now?

34:20.880 --> 34:23.520
It goes, oh, do you wanna do it or?

34:23.520 --> 34:24.320
Yeah, here's the clip.

34:24.320 --> 34:24.820
Okay.

34:26.240 --> 34:28.400
Calm yourself, breathe in.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.680
Breathe in, yes, the breath is what it's all based on.

34:32.240 --> 34:33.760
Feel the power of the breath.

34:36.480 --> 34:37.040
That's it.

34:37.040 --> 34:38.800
Yeah, that's better than my things.

34:38.800 --> 34:40.640
I'm glad you took that joke and ran with it.

34:42.080 --> 34:46.880
That address again is headspace.com slash my brother.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.120
Check out the free Headspace app

34:49.120 --> 34:51.760
and try the take 10 program and let us know what you think

34:51.760 --> 34:53.760
because I think you'll be really pleased.

34:53.760 --> 34:54.880
All right, you're done meditating.

34:54.880 --> 34:56.080
Let's get fucked up.

34:56.080 --> 34:58.480
We're gonna tell you all about Club W.

34:58.480 --> 35:01.200
Club W's got all that sweet wine juice you need

35:01.200 --> 35:02.880
to get fucking completely turnt.

35:02.880 --> 35:04.880
This probably isn't the tone that they wanted us to take

35:04.880 --> 35:05.760
in this advertisement.

35:05.760 --> 35:07.280
It's time to party.

35:07.280 --> 35:09.920
It may have been the tone that they specifically asked us

35:09.920 --> 35:11.360
not to take, it's hard to tell.

35:11.920 --> 35:13.360
Regardless of what they want,

35:13.360 --> 35:15.120
I'm gonna tell you all about Club W.

35:15.120 --> 35:18.720
Club W is a wine delivery service.

35:18.720 --> 35:20.320
It's a wine subscription service.

35:20.320 --> 35:23.680
They are leading the grape to glass wine revolution.

35:23.680 --> 35:25.120
They work directly with vineyards,

35:25.120 --> 35:28.240
cut out all the middlemen and save you money in the process.

35:28.240 --> 35:30.800
You can get premium wines delivered to your door

35:30.800 --> 35:32.720
at a third of what you'd pay at the store.

35:33.680 --> 35:35.280
And that's absolutely accurate.

35:35.280 --> 35:38.960
Like sometimes you see these shipping subscription services

35:38.960 --> 35:40.640
and you think, oh, I can't afford that.

35:40.640 --> 35:42.800
I'm just gonna go get like that super cheap wine

35:42.800 --> 35:44.160
at the gas station.

35:44.160 --> 35:45.520
No, no, no, no, don't do that.

35:45.520 --> 35:49.280

Yeah, don't be a ding dong about it.

36:17.040 --> 36:17.920
Drink responsibly.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.120
Just get fucked up in your own home

36:19.120 --> 36:20.720
when you're like watching Netflix or whatever.

36:22.160 --> 36:23.200
Got another message here.

36:23.200 --> 36:26.080
This one's for Eric and it's from Sarah.

36:26.080 --> 36:29.200
Sarah says to Eric, hey big bro, merry candle nights.

36:29.200 --> 36:32.240
We are still technically in the candle nights window.

36:32.240 --> 36:33.520
I think today's the last day actually.

36:34.720 --> 36:36.240
It has no beginning and no end.

36:36.240 --> 36:37.360
Oh, that's right.

36:37.360 --> 36:38.480
It is eternal.

36:38.480 --> 36:39.840
It is always and never.

36:39.840 --> 36:41.600
Hey big bro, merry candle nights.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.360
As I write this, it's August.

36:43.360 --> 36:46.480
So you just moved to Toronto and I miss you already.

36:46.480 --> 36:49.760
I hope you are super merry out there in the distant future.

36:49.760 --> 36:52.480
Presumably we are all having holiday merrymaking

36:52.480 --> 36:54.960
with laser trees and hover tinsel.

36:54.960 --> 36:56.080
I hope it's awesome.

36:56.080 --> 36:57.680
Love, little sister.

36:57.680 --> 36:58.400
I love that.

36:58.400 --> 36:59.600
That's so sweet.

36:59.600 --> 37:01.360
That makes me really happy that I'm a cockles.

37:01.360 --> 37:02.880
And robo-futuristic

37:02.880 --> 37:04.880
and I could have done without what you just said

37:04.880 --> 37:06.160
if I'm being frank.

37:06.160 --> 37:06.720
Cockles?

37:06.720 --> 37:07.040
Yeah.

37:07.040 --> 37:07.760
Cockles?

37:07.760 --> 37:08.080
Yeah.

37:08.080 --> 37:09.040
I don't know why.

37:09.040 --> 37:10.320
There's nothing wrong with cockles.

37:10.320 --> 37:11.360
Nothing wrong with cockles.

37:11.360 --> 37:12.320
There's like seven.

37:12.320 --> 37:13.680
Ain't nothing wrong with no cockles.

37:13.680 --> 37:14.000
Okay.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.200
Nothing wrong.

37:15.200 --> 37:15.840
Read this next thing.

37:15.840 --> 37:16.560
Cockles, cockles, cockles.

37:16.560 --> 37:18.800
Stop, stop, next thing, next message, next message.

37:18.800 --> 37:20.080
I got a message for Casey.

37:20.080 --> 37:21.040
It's from Sarah.

37:21.040 --> 37:22.720
Sarah, you're probably listening to this

37:22.720 --> 37:24.480
while you're working hard to take home

37:24.480 --> 37:26.000
that sweet, sweet bacon.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.800
Know that you are truly a badass

37:28.800 --> 37:30.400
and that your badassery is exceeded

37:30.400 --> 37:32.560
only by your handsome face

37:32.560 --> 37:36.400
and your kind, huge heart.

37:36.400 --> 37:36.720
Okay.

37:36.720 --> 37:38.720
Merry Christmas or whatever.

37:38.720 --> 37:40.560
Depending on when this message is read,

37:40.560 --> 37:41.200
I love you.

37:43.360 --> 37:44.800
The last line of this is,

37:45.440 --> 37:47.040
brothers, help me punch it up

37:47.040 --> 37:50.080
with the joke or something as far as I get.

37:50.080 --> 37:52.160
I think I get sort of the shape of the message

37:52.160 --> 37:54.320
they were trying to send to us there discreetly.

37:54.320 --> 37:54.880
Okay.

37:54.880 --> 37:55.360
All right.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.560
So punch it up with the joke.

37:56.560 --> 37:59.440
Like, where can we get a joke in that message?

37:59.440 --> 38:00.400
Is there a joke in there?

38:01.280 --> 38:03.280
We're not really good at making up jokes.

38:03.280 --> 38:03.600
Yeah.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.840
Not if like, not if we're told to

38:05.840 --> 38:07.520
because we're kind of fucking rebellious.

38:09.040 --> 38:12.000
I like to imagine that Casey works at like

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
some sort of pig destruction,

38:14.640 --> 38:17.360
like pig annihilation facility

38:17.360 --> 38:19.280
where the meats are claimed

38:19.280 --> 38:22.160
and then processed into literal sweet, sweet bacon.

38:22.160 --> 38:25.760
Or maybe it's that antique reclaimed meat.

38:26.320 --> 38:26.880
Oh, I see.

38:26.880 --> 38:29.440
It just sort of takes the scrapple, the leavens.

38:30.000 --> 38:30.800
Yeah, where it's like,

38:30.800 --> 38:32.800
oh, we found this scrapple in an old school

38:32.800 --> 38:33.600
that we tore down.

38:33.600 --> 38:34.320
Yeah, sure.

38:34.320 --> 38:35.520
And now we've cleaned it up.

38:35.520 --> 38:37.200
We've got some reclaimed bacon.

38:37.200 --> 38:37.840
Yeah.

38:37.840 --> 38:38.400
That's great.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.000
If you want to make a coffee table out of that

38:40.000 --> 38:41.040
or like a headboard.

38:41.040 --> 38:43.120
Yeah, or a meat or bacon.

38:43.120 --> 38:44.880
Sweet, sweet bacon.

38:44.880 --> 38:46.080
So it's bacon, but it's...

38:46.080 --> 38:49.280
I was going to make like a joke about something

38:49.280 --> 38:50.960
that would be silly to do with bacon,

38:50.960 --> 38:53.120
but everybody's done fucking everything

38:53.760 --> 38:54.640
silly with bacon.

38:54.640 --> 38:55.920
There's like nothing I could say here

38:55.920 --> 38:56.880
that wouldn't be like,

38:56.880 --> 38:58.320
you could turn it into shaving cream.

38:58.320 --> 38:59.280
And then there's like a guy

38:59.280 --> 39:00.480
with a handlebar mustache like,

39:00.480 --> 39:03.760
actually, we've been making bacon-based shaving cream

39:03.760 --> 39:06.960
out of our Brooklyn-based distillery.

39:06.960 --> 39:08.240
That's good stuff, yeah.

39:08.240 --> 39:10.400
All of this is joke-like.

39:10.400 --> 39:11.440
So I think we've fulfilled-

39:11.440 --> 39:12.640
Similar to a joke, right?

39:12.640 --> 39:13.040
Yes.

39:13.040 --> 39:16.560
We've fulfilled the charge.

39:16.560 --> 39:19.520
Tai is a pedantic person.

39:19.520 --> 39:21.600
I think when he pronounces these words,

39:21.600 --> 39:23.840
it's in a very show-off-y way.

39:24.480 --> 39:25.280
Jairo.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.160
Yiro.

39:26.160 --> 39:27.200
Sacrebleu.

39:27.200 --> 39:28.240
Sacrebleu.

39:28.240 --> 39:29.200
Ayers Rock.

39:29.200 --> 39:29.840
Uluru.

39:32.800 --> 39:35.200
What you are witnessing is real.

39:35.200 --> 39:37.440
The participants are not actors.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.920
They are actual litigants with real cases.

39:40.480 --> 39:42.240
They call in via Skype

39:42.240 --> 39:44.400
to Judge John Hodgman's court,

39:44.400 --> 39:46.320
the real people's court.

39:46.320 --> 39:49.920
Now I call you to Judge John Hodgman's internet court.

39:49.920 --> 39:52.320
Find it at MaximumFun.org

39:52.320 --> 39:54.160
or wherever you download podcasts.

39:55.840 --> 39:56.720
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

39:57.840 --> 39:58.720
Yes, please.

39:58.720 --> 40:02.640
This Yahoo was sent in by a couple of people, actually.

40:02.640 --> 40:05.040
Matt Stout and Chloe Smith-Guitard.

40:07.920 --> 40:10.240
Chloe Smith-Guitard and Matt Stout.

40:10.240 --> 40:12.160
Matt, I'm sorry, I didn't say your name like four times.

40:12.160 --> 40:13.360
Thank you, both of you.

40:13.360 --> 40:15.760
It's by Yahoo Answers user Joe who asks,

40:16.560 --> 40:18.480
is having an imaginary enemy

40:18.480 --> 40:20.800
worse than having an imaginary friend?

40:23.440 --> 40:24.720
Worse in what context?

40:24.720 --> 40:26.640
I mean, categorically, it's probably worse, right?

40:26.640 --> 40:29.200
Like you got this fucking specter

40:29.200 --> 40:30.320
that only you can see

40:31.200 --> 40:33.440
that's just trying to mess with your shit all day.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.440
But you know what, I get it.

40:35.440 --> 40:35.940
Okay.

40:36.480 --> 40:37.760
Let me explain why.

40:37.760 --> 40:42.080
There's a little cult classic called Red Dwarf, right?

40:42.080 --> 40:45.600
And the whole premise is that, spoiler,

40:45.600 --> 40:48.480
there's a dude who's like the last surviving guy

40:48.480 --> 40:50.240
on a space station or a spaceship.

40:51.120 --> 40:53.440
And the hologram that the computer brings back

40:53.440 --> 40:55.200
is not the people he liked the most,

40:55.200 --> 40:57.280
but his roommate that he never got along with

40:57.280 --> 40:58.720
and they constantly bicker

40:58.720 --> 41:01.200
because they constantly bicker.

41:01.200 --> 41:04.160
That's what kind of keeps it interesting.

41:04.160 --> 41:05.440
There's that odd couple shit.

41:05.440 --> 41:08.320
Yeah, so you get that enemy who's like a friend to you.

41:09.520 --> 41:10.720
Like the people in Justify.

41:10.720 --> 41:12.080
I've had an imaginary friend

41:12.080 --> 41:14.160
since I was four years old named Marcus.

41:15.280 --> 41:15.920
Big Marcus?

41:16.720 --> 41:18.640
I mean, he was big when I was a little kid

41:18.640 --> 41:22.160
because when I was a little kid, Marcus was 36 years old.

41:22.160 --> 41:24.400
But now I might kind of catching up to him a little bit.

41:24.400 --> 41:25.280
Now he's just Marcus.

41:25.280 --> 41:25.920
He's ageless.

41:25.920 --> 41:27.520
And now, yeah, we're similar sizes.

41:29.280 --> 41:30.560
So yeah, he's 36.

41:30.560 --> 41:31.520
One day I'm gonna be an old man

41:31.520 --> 41:32.320
and I'm gonna talk to Marcus

41:32.320 --> 41:33.600
and I'm gonna be jealous of his youth.

41:33.600 --> 41:35.360
Anyway, Marcus means a lot to me.

41:35.360 --> 41:37.760
But I can't help but think like,

41:37.760 --> 41:42.160
what if I had an imaginary enemy also named-

41:42.160 --> 41:43.040
Sparkus.

41:43.040 --> 41:43.280
Noelle.

41:44.160 --> 41:44.800
Sportacus.

41:44.800 --> 41:45.760
Dwayne The Rock Johnson.

41:45.760 --> 41:46.640
What if it was The Rock?

41:46.640 --> 41:47.840
Or what if it was Triple H?

41:47.840 --> 41:48.640
We'll say Triple H.

41:49.680 --> 41:51.360
The Rock based humor is a little bit overused.

41:51.360 --> 41:53.280
A little bit, yeah.

41:53.280 --> 41:56.240
So I have an imaginary enemy, Goldust.

41:56.240 --> 41:59.840
And then I could just, it's great for two reasons.

41:59.840 --> 42:03.120
One, Goldust is like gonna fucking constantly be coming at me

42:03.120 --> 42:04.720
and that pressure I'm gonna feel,

42:04.720 --> 42:07.200
it's gonna like two blades sharpening against each other.

42:07.200 --> 42:09.040
And then when I'm attacked by real life Goldust

42:09.040 --> 42:12.560
or real life Triple H or any WWE roster member,

42:12.560 --> 42:13.680
I'll be able to fucking take him on

42:13.680 --> 42:14.800
because I'll know the moves.

42:14.800 --> 42:17.840
Secondly, I can make Marcus and Triple H

42:17.840 --> 42:19.920
just fight whenever I want and just watch it.

42:19.920 --> 42:22.240
But what if it was more of a psychological enemy

42:22.240 --> 42:23.440
than it was a physical enemy

42:23.440 --> 42:25.760
and you just had someone like next to you all day-

42:25.760 --> 42:26.480
Are you rating me?

42:26.480 --> 42:27.840
Are you really gonna wear that shirt?

42:27.840 --> 42:28.640
Same principle applies

42:28.640 --> 42:30.880
because then I'll learn some good real life teardowns.

42:30.880 --> 42:32.480
And then like if I fucking run into Sheamus

42:32.480 --> 42:34.800
and he cuts in line at like Best Buy or whatever,

42:34.800 --> 42:36.160
I can just like tear his shit apart

42:36.160 --> 42:38.000
because I've had practice doing it.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.200
Wait, is Sheamus real?

42:39.200 --> 42:39.920
Yeah, he's a real one.

42:40.480 --> 42:41.040
Are you sure?

42:41.040 --> 42:42.640
Yeah, he's got red hair, he's current champ.

42:42.640 --> 42:44.240
Or he was, I don't know, I haven't watched him in a while.

42:44.240 --> 42:49.280
Anyway, one of the great things about having Goldust

42:49.280 --> 42:51.280
coming at you 24 seven-

42:51.280 --> 42:52.000
Yeah.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.840
Is that whenever you get into one of those times

42:55.840 --> 42:57.840
where people are comparing like how rough

42:57.840 --> 42:58.960
they're having it currently

42:58.960 --> 43:01.200
or like what a bad weekend they've had.

43:01.200 --> 43:03.360
And like you say, well, you know, I couldn't get in the restaurant

43:03.360 --> 43:05.280
I wanted to and everybody forgot my birthday.

43:05.280 --> 43:07.600
And you can always sort of tack on at the end.

43:08.320 --> 43:10.720
And also I have Goldust coming at me.

43:10.720 --> 43:11.120
Yeah.

43:11.120 --> 43:12.160
24 seven.

43:12.160 --> 43:12.560
I mean, it can-

43:12.560 --> 43:14.720
Like it makes everything way more impressive.

43:14.720 --> 43:15.840
Anything you can accomplish.

43:15.840 --> 43:17.600
It can make things kind of uncomfortable every now-

43:17.600 --> 43:18.320
Oh, fuck.

43:18.320 --> 43:18.960
No, not now.

43:20.640 --> 43:21.200
Goldust!

43:23.200 --> 43:23.700
Come on!

43:23.700 --> 43:33.060
Come on!

43:33.060 --> 43:33.560
Hey.

43:34.980 --> 43:35.860
Everything all right?

43:35.860 --> 43:37.780
I was really scared for a second.

43:37.780 --> 43:40.100
I thought a spider jumped on you.

43:41.060 --> 43:42.260
No, I mean even worse.

43:42.900 --> 43:45.140
It was a man dressed up in like gold grease paint and stuff.

43:45.780 --> 43:47.140
I fucking got him though.

43:47.140 --> 43:48.980
I know his fucking ways now.

43:48.980 --> 43:51.460
Cause I'm way bigger than when I was seven.

43:51.460 --> 43:53.380
I used to just get fucking dunked on.

43:53.380 --> 43:53.860
But now I get-

43:53.860 --> 43:54.580
Yeah, that's right.

43:54.580 --> 43:55.300
Motherfucker.

43:56.740 --> 43:59.060
Wait, Goldust has been coming at you since you were seven?

43:59.060 --> 43:59.300
Yeah.

44:02.100 --> 44:04.180
Listen, I had to mature really, really quickly.

44:05.540 --> 44:09.540
Goldust seems like a weird vicious predator.

44:09.540 --> 44:11.380
Yeah, it's a hard childhood, man.

44:11.380 --> 44:14.660
The type of like vicious predator that only a child could envision.

44:15.700 --> 44:16.980
I'm a little bit winded.

44:17.700 --> 44:19.060
Yeah, but here's the problem.

44:19.060 --> 44:23.940
You get so used to the daily almost like hourly momentary attacks.

44:23.940 --> 44:24.340
Yeah.

44:24.340 --> 44:26.980
That one day when it doesn't come, you'll miss it.

44:26.980 --> 44:28.820
Well, no, we have a schedule.

44:30.260 --> 44:30.900
It's my fault.

44:31.540 --> 44:33.060
It was 10 before the hour.

44:33.620 --> 44:36.420
But what I'm saying is what if one day he moves on, Griffin,

44:36.420 --> 44:39.780
and your imaginary friend is no longer there and he's not attacking you.

44:39.780 --> 44:43.460
I guess I'm just gonna have to fucking spar with Marcus at that point.

44:44.340 --> 44:45.700
Marcus is a lover, not a fighter.

44:45.700 --> 44:46.020
You're right.

44:46.020 --> 44:48.660
He loses every time I make him and Goldust fight each other.

44:48.660 --> 44:52.340
Sometimes Marcus like stands in for me if I'm, you know, sick or whatever.

44:53.700 --> 44:55.700
Boy, I love watching those two rowdy boys fight, though.

44:56.580 --> 44:59.300
Oh, how come when you say weird shit, everyone's on board.

44:59.300 --> 45:02.100
But when I say weird shit, they're like, stop talking about mangoes, Travis.

45:02.660 --> 45:03.140
I don't.

45:03.140 --> 45:04.100
Well, mine was real.

45:05.140 --> 45:06.980
Mine was like a real thing that I deal with all the time.

45:06.980 --> 45:10.980
Yeah, Griffin's was a few fortunate truth.

45:10.980 --> 45:11.220
Yes.

45:12.340 --> 45:16.740
Can we circle back around to this next year?

45:16.740 --> 45:18.100
Like, what has happened?

45:18.100 --> 45:19.380
What are we doing?

45:19.380 --> 45:20.100
What do you mean?

45:20.900 --> 45:22.020
It's 2016.

45:22.020 --> 45:22.660
What is it?

45:22.660 --> 45:26.500
Like, we're about to end this episode and we still have an answer for that question.

45:26.500 --> 45:28.980
I mean, we did answer it 2016, building bridges.

45:28.980 --> 45:31.620
Are we 100% certain on that, though?

45:31.620 --> 45:33.460
I want something with a positive message.

45:33.460 --> 45:37.940
I was suggested while you were in the turlet, 20 quicksteen, stop putting it off.

45:37.940 --> 45:41.140
And because, you know, 20 quicksteen, you gotta be quick.

45:41.140 --> 45:41.860
Nah, it sucks.

45:41.860 --> 45:42.660
Too much pressure.

45:42.660 --> 45:44.100
It's like a pressure.

45:44.100 --> 45:45.780
It's a pressure thing I don't really like.

45:45.780 --> 45:49.620
I feel like 2016 is good, building bridges, because you only have to do it once.

45:49.620 --> 45:52.180
So you only have to work up the courage to do it once during the year.

45:52.180 --> 45:54.660
You build one bridge and then they build one bridge.

45:54.660 --> 45:57.140
Oh, so we'll make it 2016, building bridge.

45:57.860 --> 45:59.220
Yeah, it can't be plural.

45:59.220 --> 46:00.980
You have to build at least two bridges.

46:00.980 --> 46:01.700
Yeah, that's a good point.

46:01.700 --> 46:05.140
But you could build two half bridges and then they meet each other in the middle.

46:06.260 --> 46:08.500
I don't think there's such a thing as a half bridge.

46:08.500 --> 46:09.860
Yeah, it's just a dock.

46:09.860 --> 46:19.380
That was fucking funny.

46:19.380 --> 46:20.740
That was funny, Travis.

46:20.740 --> 46:21.540
Thank you.

46:21.540 --> 46:22.260
It's time to get hard.

46:22.260 --> 46:23.940
That's what happens when you're on dayquil.

46:23.940 --> 46:24.980
You gotta get hard.

46:24.980 --> 46:27.220
This is the year we go hard on people who own docks.

46:27.220 --> 46:27.940
Like, come on.

46:27.940 --> 46:30.420
Just finish it.

46:30.420 --> 46:31.140
Here's a hammer.

46:31.140 --> 46:32.100
Here's some wood.

46:32.100 --> 46:33.220
It's time to finish it.

46:34.020 --> 46:38.580
2016 building bridges is good because you can also, I mean, you've got that fucking,

46:38.580 --> 46:42.180
you've had that hole in your garage for two years.

46:42.180 --> 46:43.380
Fucking take care of it.

46:43.380 --> 46:44.580
It's time to take care of it.

46:44.580 --> 46:45.380
Put a bridge on it.

46:45.380 --> 46:48.900
Because let me tell you, Justin, to your earlier point about this being 2016,

46:48.900 --> 46:50.820
and this year's gonna suck, you're wrong.

46:50.820 --> 46:54.500
This is the year where we fucking batten down the hatches for 2017,

46:54.500 --> 46:57.860
where, oh my God, it's going to get real.

46:57.860 --> 47:01.940
It is time to doomsday prep the shit out of 2016.

47:01.940 --> 47:02.980
I don't agree with that.

47:02.980 --> 47:04.500
And I'd rather not think that way.

47:04.500 --> 47:04.980
Okay.

47:04.980 --> 47:07.220
But I think every year is gonna be better than the year before.

47:07.220 --> 47:08.980
Well, that's the way it's been for me so far.

47:08.980 --> 47:11.780
You were the one who pitched 2016.

47:11.780 --> 47:14.100
That was about setting expectations.

47:14.660 --> 47:15.300
Thank you, Griffin.

47:15.300 --> 47:18.500
Yes, it was about lowering expectations and enjoying the year more

47:18.500 --> 47:23.940
as a result of this sort of like stoic perception of the situation.

47:23.940 --> 47:32.180
But I think that 2016 building bridges, I'm glad we have another sub colon on a year.

47:32.180 --> 47:37.860
I think that's very important.

47:37.860 --> 47:38.660
Should we wrap up?

47:38.660 --> 47:40.420
I know you got a place to be.

47:41.140 --> 47:41.860
We all got places to be.

47:41.860 --> 47:43.540
I know it's kind of a short one.

47:43.540 --> 47:44.660
Yeah, it's been a short one.

47:44.660 --> 47:47.300
But we had like one hour to record today.

47:47.300 --> 47:48.340
We are barely here.

47:49.540 --> 47:50.500
What do we usually do here?

47:51.620 --> 47:54.820
Well, this is the part where, first off, I thank everybody for coming to Candle Nights.

47:54.820 --> 47:55.320
Thank you.

47:56.660 --> 47:59.540
Thank you to a big thank you.

47:59.540 --> 48:02.660
You know, I didn't mention it repeatedly.

48:02.660 --> 48:08.340
But thank you so much to the folks on the My Brother, My Brother, Me Appreciation group

48:08.340 --> 48:16.500
that helped with filling the empty stockings, the NBNBA Angels who helped fill the empty

48:16.500 --> 48:22.260
stockings, especially Valerie Harness and all the other volunteers who helped make that possible.

48:22.260 --> 48:27.620
We really like, I say we, I didn't do that much.

48:27.620 --> 48:34.340
But the folks in that group and they even some of the people in that group like Jessica

48:34.340 --> 48:39.940
brought a bag of clothes when she went to Candle Nights to drop off at one of the charities.

48:39.940 --> 48:43.380
When we talk to people, like when we're in town for the holidays, we talk to people like

48:43.380 --> 48:44.900
we've known our whole lives from Huntington.

48:44.900 --> 48:46.180
They talk about that shit.

48:46.180 --> 48:46.980
So thank you so much.

48:48.260 --> 48:52.660
Thank you to, gosh, everybody.

48:52.660 --> 48:56.260
We got a bunch of gifts from folks and they were so sweet and so amazing.

48:56.260 --> 49:00.100
And we'll read all those off in the next episode.

49:00.100 --> 49:03.940
We literally are out of time to do it, which I know sounds ungrateful and shitty.

49:03.940 --> 49:10.340
But thank you all so, so, so much for we like spent like an hour opening presents the day

49:10.340 --> 49:14.340
that we all open presents from everybody that had sent it to our PO box.

49:14.340 --> 49:16.340
It was super cool and we appreciate it so much.

49:16.340 --> 49:19.460
And we'll have time to be more grateful soon.

49:19.460 --> 49:24.340
I also want to say a quick congratulations to Dexter who beat me in the My Brother, My

49:24.340 --> 49:26.580
Brother and Me Fantasy Football League Championship.

49:26.580 --> 49:27.620
It was fucking close.

49:27.620 --> 49:28.820
It was a nail biter, man.

49:28.820 --> 49:29.540
Yeah, it was.

49:29.540 --> 49:31.060
He won by like one point.

49:31.060 --> 49:32.260
Congratulations, Dexter.

49:33.140 --> 49:35.540
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's

49:35.540 --> 49:37.940
a Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

49:37.940 --> 49:40.260
We signed a couple copies of that during Candle Nights.

49:40.260 --> 49:42.820
A lot of people train those as gifts, which I like.

49:42.820 --> 49:43.860
It's a good gift.

49:43.860 --> 49:44.660
Good album.

49:44.660 --> 49:45.940
Go listen to the other Maximum Fun shows.

49:50.180 --> 49:52.580
And let's wrap up.

49:52.580 --> 49:53.460
That's what I do for us.

49:53.460 --> 49:54.260
Thank you so much, Griffin.

49:54.260 --> 49:55.540
Do you have a final question for everybody?

49:55.540 --> 49:56.020
Final one.

49:56.020 --> 49:57.780
It was sent in by Rachel Siska.

49:57.780 --> 49:58.420
Thank you, Rachel.

49:58.420 --> 50:04.900
It's by Yahoo Answers user Prometheus who asks, why does the Full House and Family Matters

50:04.900 --> 50:06.260
theme sound the same?

50:06.260 --> 50:07.220
Are they the same?

50:09.860 --> 50:11.220
I'm Justin McElroy.

50:11.220 --> 50:12.020
I'm Travis McElroy.

50:12.020 --> 50:12.980
I'm Griffin McElroy.

50:12.980 --> 50:14.180
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

50:14.180 --> 50:14.900
Kiss your dad.

50:14.900 --> 50:24.500
Square on the lips.

50:33.540 --> 50:35.460
MaximumFun.org.

50:35.460 --> 50:36.500
Comedy and culture.

50:36.500 --> 50:37.620
Artist owned.

50:37.620 --> 50:38.660
Listener supported.

50:38.660 --> 50:43.460
The three of you went to a cave of a big red dragon and is standing over a horde of precious

50:43.460 --> 50:44.820
golden rubies.

50:44.820 --> 50:47.060
And he says, what do you do, adventurers?

50:47.060 --> 50:48.260
I'm a dragon man.

50:48.260 --> 50:49.140
I cast fire on him.

50:49.140 --> 50:50.020
It's very good.

50:50.020 --> 50:54.660
I address the red dragon and say, us, we're the host of the Adventure Zone, a podcast

50:54.660 --> 50:57.220
about family playing Dungeons and Dragons.

50:57.220 --> 50:58.260
Very good synergy.

50:58.260 --> 50:59.140
Commit to the bit.

51:00.580 --> 51:02.740
I roll to charm new listeners.

51:02.740 --> 51:05.540
It is very effective against all odds.

51:05.540 --> 51:06.580
Everybody, we're the McElroys.

51:06.580 --> 51:07.540
We host the Adventure Zone.

51:07.540 --> 51:09.620
It's a podcast where we play Dungeons and Dragons together.

51:09.620 --> 51:10.980
It's a comedy podcast.

51:10.980 --> 51:13.940
We don't take the rules too seriously because there's a lot of them and we did not take

51:13.940 --> 51:14.660
the time to learn them.

51:14.660 --> 51:15.380
Maybe listen to us.

51:15.380 --> 51:18.020
We come out every other Thursday on the Maximum Fun Network.

51:18.020 --> 51:20.740
You can find us on iTunes or on MaximumFun.org.

51:20.740 --> 51:41.540
I think this promo is a critical hit.
