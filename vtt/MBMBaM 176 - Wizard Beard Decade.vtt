WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:46.800 --> 00:52.880
I still think that sound needs some- I still think you guys haven't mastered that sound.

00:52.880 --> 00:59.920
Welcome to 2013 Thorwatch 2013. More like 2014.

00:59.920 --> 01:09.440
2013 get your hammer and start pounding us where my brother, my brother and me Thorwatch 2013.

01:09.440 --> 01:18.880
I'm Justin Thor McElroy. I'm Thorvis McElroy. And I'm just plain old Thor. Guys,

01:20.240 --> 01:25.040
there's not a lot of excitement in the air this time around. I feel like as much as there was

01:25.040 --> 01:31.360
the last Thorwatch. So I think that the three of us should just keep it low key.

01:32.800 --> 01:37.760
Well, Griffin, I don't know what movie theaters you've been sitting in the lobby of,

01:37.760 --> 01:45.680
but at my local movie theater, as I sit there and I listen and people are talking about Thor.

01:45.680 --> 01:46.240
Yeah.

01:46.240 --> 01:50.640
Justin, I've been meaning to talk to you about that. We've had complaints and we would like it

01:50.640 --> 01:54.640
if you would just stop sitting in movie theater lobbies for hours on end.

01:54.640 --> 01:59.840
Just yelling, Thor, anybody? Anybody for Thor?

02:01.920 --> 02:05.520
I should stop standing by the roof and clucking my tongue disapprovingly every time someone

02:05.520 --> 02:11.040
purchases a ticket for Gravity or any other film that isn't Thor, The Dark World.

02:12.560 --> 02:19.520
You should also stop breaking into the projection rooms and killing projectionists

02:19.520 --> 02:25.600
and replacing all of the movies in the theater with Thor, Thor 2 and Thor Classic.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.600
I just love Thor.

02:30.160 --> 02:34.960
I know, but that's murder is what you're doing, is what you're doing there.

02:34.960 --> 02:39.120
I know it's a lonely life that a projectionist leads and that they don't have anybody

02:39.920 --> 02:40.960
that will miss them.

02:41.520 --> 02:43.280
But that's how you get phantoms.

02:43.280 --> 02:46.240
But that's how you get phantoms of the Thor theater.

02:48.080 --> 02:52.880
This year, this time, Thor is taking on his biggest opponent yet.

02:53.680 --> 02:54.880
Alzheimer's.

02:54.880 --> 03:03.040
And he is teaming back up with Loki, his brother, who's also another handsome god,

03:03.040 --> 03:05.920
and the two of them are really going to take it.

03:06.960 --> 03:08.400
How's Natalie Portman doing, though?

03:09.360 --> 03:10.880
She got really phat.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.160
She's incredibly phat.

03:16.160 --> 03:20.800
It's the weirdest twist in the movie is that she's really phat.

03:21.920 --> 03:23.760
And not like actress Natalie Portman.

03:23.760 --> 03:26.800
She's in like a shallow howl suit.

03:26.800 --> 03:32.000
And I think the message is that she missed Thor so much, she, etc, etc.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.280
I don't think that's a good, I don't think that's a good message.

03:35.280 --> 03:39.680
I don't think the message of as soon as her, her god love left her.

03:40.480 --> 03:43.760
She just, she tried to fill it up.

03:43.760 --> 03:49.120
Well, this is also the same film that taught our children that hammers are toys.

03:49.680 --> 03:52.080
So I don't know that you should look to it for guidance.

03:53.200 --> 03:56.000
This is my brother, my brother and me, as you certainly gathered.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.880
It's a Thor Watch 2013 special episode all about Thor,

04:00.880 --> 04:02.400
but it's also an advice show.

04:02.400 --> 04:09.680
So before we get back to the God of Thunder, let's get right into the advising.

04:12.400 --> 04:16.560
Dear brothers, I was just recently accepted into the Pennsylvania bar,

04:16.560 --> 04:21.040
which means I'll finally be able to start looking for jobs as an attorney.

04:21.040 --> 04:23.280
Man, my morning voice is like really good.

04:23.920 --> 04:27.200
Can we point out that we're recording this at like an ungodly hour?

04:27.200 --> 04:28.880
You're so welcome, everybody.

04:28.880 --> 04:31.120
Cause I got to, I got to, I'm going on vacation.

04:31.120 --> 04:32.320
So we got to bang it out early.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.280
Tell everybody what you're doing.

04:33.280 --> 04:34.160
Fucking nerd alert.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.200
I'm going to London.

04:37.200 --> 04:37.360
Yeah.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.480
You hear that, Doug?

04:38.480 --> 04:39.520
I'm coming to London.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.720
And he's going to fuck you.

04:42.720 --> 04:44.080
I want to fuck you, Doug.

04:44.080 --> 04:47.920
No, I'm coming to the, we're going to go to the new Punch Chunk show.

04:47.920 --> 04:51.040
We're going to go to the Dr. Who Celebration.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.280
But somebody stay at my house, so don't even try it.

04:56.880 --> 04:57.360
Crooks.

04:57.360 --> 05:03.760
I would, uh, so something about the bar, uh, there's an issue, however, as I'm full-blooded

05:03.760 --> 05:08.160
Greek man and I am slightly overweight.

05:08.160 --> 05:09.120
That's the way it's written.

05:09.120 --> 05:09.760
There's like four-

05:09.760 --> 05:11.200
Like the Sega theme song?

05:11.200 --> 05:19.440
L, slightly overweight, which means, uh, for me, I wear a beer and almost constantly is full.

05:19.440 --> 05:24.640
It is luxurious, but it is generally kept manageable and not at all frightening or

05:24.640 --> 05:25.360
homeless looking.

05:25.360 --> 05:30.560
My question is when I go to fancy lawyer interviews, should I shave the beard and go

05:30.560 --> 05:32.400
with my fat baby face?

05:32.400 --> 05:34.320
Or should I keep the beard?

05:34.320 --> 05:36.880
Is it professional to go to interviews with the beard?

05:36.880 --> 05:38.960
Will it make the potential employers jealous?

05:39.520 --> 05:43.040
I have had wildly differing opinions from actual lawyers.

05:43.040 --> 05:48.560
I was wondering if you brothers would be able to light the way to my path to full-time

05:48.560 --> 05:50.160
employment and adulthood.

05:50.160 --> 05:54.960
In grace and favor of the Lord, Pilferus Pleater in Pittsburgh.

05:54.960 --> 05:59.760
It's not 1952, like beards have had a huge resurgence.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.680
I don't mean that they're low-class at all.

06:01.680 --> 06:07.440
But among which communities has that resurgence truly found purchase?

06:07.440 --> 06:08.160
Hipsters.

06:08.160 --> 06:11.600
Well, there's that, but there's also like-

06:11.600 --> 06:15.920
Greek lawyers, slightly overweight Greek lawyers is a big upturn.

06:15.920 --> 06:16.480
Yeah.

06:16.480 --> 06:18.000
I've been reading the trades.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.200
I've been reading the trades.

06:20.080 --> 06:28.400
I feel like when I think about most of my bearded bros, they're party Dave's.

06:29.760 --> 06:30.480
They're like-

06:30.480 --> 06:31.760
Let me throw this out.

06:31.760 --> 06:32.800
Psychiatrists.

06:34.000 --> 06:34.960
I guess.

06:34.960 --> 06:37.520
I think you can get into psychiatry with a beard.

06:37.520 --> 06:40.160
Travis, you have a beard right now, right?

06:40.160 --> 06:41.600
Yes, it's glorious.

06:41.600 --> 06:42.320
It's glorious.

06:43.200 --> 06:47.200
I mean, it's not as full lushness, but I don't think you let it get there anymore.

06:47.200 --> 06:50.400
Well, I'm going to, I'm going to build because people don't usually do this,

06:50.400 --> 06:54.480
but I'm going to do no shave November, but I'm going to do wizard beard.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.640
If you're going to do no shave November,

06:56.640 --> 07:00.160
you probably should have kicked it into high gear a couple of weeks ago.

07:00.160 --> 07:03.200
Well, I'm actually going to do a wizard beard decade.

07:04.880 --> 07:06.960
It's not as fun of portmanteau, but-

07:10.080 --> 07:13.280
What charity are you raising money for in wizard beard decade?

07:13.280 --> 07:14.400
Wizard beard for kids.

07:14.400 --> 07:19.360
So this is a, this is a charitable organization

07:19.920 --> 07:22.560
that just really needs to get some beards on some kid faces.

07:23.440 --> 07:26.720
Basically, I have to grow my beard out 12 inches and then they cut it out

07:26.720 --> 07:27.760
and then glue it on a kid.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.480
Whether he wants it or not.

07:30.480 --> 07:37.600
I saw that bat kid thing yesterday and I think it's so, so sweet

07:37.600 --> 07:39.920
that they did that for that beardless kid.

07:40.720 --> 07:43.040
You know, he doesn't have a beard, but he can be Batman.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.560
You just took the nicest,

07:44.560 --> 07:48.320
you just took literally the nicest thing I've ever seen happen in my lifetime

07:48.320 --> 07:53.840
and you twisted it and you used it for comedy purposes.

07:53.840 --> 07:57.760
You just took the efforts of over 10,000 kindhearted volunteers

07:57.760 --> 08:00.400
and then you took it and you put your butt on it.

08:03.120 --> 08:03.840
Comedy.

08:03.840 --> 08:04.880
What is comedy?

08:04.880 --> 08:07.440
Lots of people have wondered throughout the ages as it happens.

08:07.440 --> 08:09.200
It is apparently tragedy.

08:09.200 --> 08:12.320
Tragedy plus 16 hours is what it is.

08:12.320 --> 08:13.520
Plus your butt.

08:13.520 --> 08:15.120
Putting your butt on things.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.960
I wanted to point this out to you guys.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.040
This is going to be a very, very specific, very, very local joke.

08:23.040 --> 08:26.400
You know how there's like a weird recurring billboard in every town?

08:26.400 --> 08:29.200
Like why does this person own all the billboards?

08:29.200 --> 08:32.320
For Austin, it's this guy named David Comey, the attorney that rocks.

08:33.840 --> 08:37.760
He looks like the dude from Battlefield Earth.

08:37.760 --> 08:40.960
He does look exactly like John Travolta in Battlefield Earth.

08:40.960 --> 08:41.920
That's right, Travis.

08:41.920 --> 08:44.480
He also kind of looks like unfrozen caveman lawyer.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.440
He's got these really, really gross dreadlocks.

08:47.440 --> 08:51.760
This like the pubiest pew-pew beard I've ever seen in my entire life.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.600
His face is on every billboard.

08:55.600 --> 08:56.960
He made some choices.

08:56.960 --> 08:57.760
He made some choices.

08:57.760 --> 09:02.240
So I think if you can manage your shit, move to Austin

09:02.240 --> 09:08.240
and maybe you can be David Comey, the more demure bearded lawyer.

09:08.240 --> 09:14.560
I think as long as you keep it slim and trim beard-wise, you're absolutely fine.

09:15.280 --> 09:19.600
Yeah, if it looks like a cultivated zen garden on your face,

09:19.600 --> 09:23.600
then your beard is appropriate for any situation.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.760
Austin, maybe shave your basketball number into it.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.360
I can't.

09:27.360 --> 09:28.080
I don't think we should.

09:28.080 --> 09:28.880
Limit your appeal.

09:29.840 --> 09:33.200
Yeah, are you talking about like it would be so rich and full

09:33.200 --> 09:37.120
that you could like sculpt it like a topiary into a number?

09:37.120 --> 09:38.080
That'd be pretty dope.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.600
Okay, you want a Yahoo?

09:39.600 --> 09:40.400
Please.

09:40.400 --> 09:42.800
This Yahoo was sent in by Julie Kin.

09:42.800 --> 09:43.760
Thanks, Julie.

09:43.760 --> 09:46.960
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Julia Family Account.

09:46.960 --> 09:51.280
Don't even trip.

09:51.280 --> 09:55.440
If you look for Julia's personal account, you're gonna find some shit.

09:55.440 --> 09:59.760
This is her G-rated stuff she can share with the husband and the kids.

09:59.760 --> 10:04.480
Julia Family Account asks, what's a good time to watch Made in Manhattan?

10:05.680 --> 10:06.400
Anytime.

10:06.400 --> 10:10.800
I'm on Jennifer Lopez movie kick, and I can't figure out a good time to watch

10:10.800 --> 10:16.240
what some of my friends consider one of the best romance movies of all time.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.760
What is the perfect time to watch?

10:17.760 --> 10:19.120
Also, where can I rent it?

10:19.120 --> 10:20.160
Julia.

10:20.160 --> 10:21.440
Julia.

10:21.440 --> 10:23.040
Julia, that last part.

10:25.040 --> 10:25.680
Sweetheart.

10:26.400 --> 10:27.520
Go take a big shit.

10:27.520 --> 10:29.840
Sweetheart.

10:29.840 --> 10:33.360
Go take a big drink of water, but keep the water in your mouth, then spin around

10:33.360 --> 10:38.240
spitting wildly, and some of your water is gonna land on a copy of Made in Manhattan,

10:38.240 --> 10:42.880
either on a device that has Netflix on it or just on the DVD,

10:42.880 --> 10:44.560
because I'm pretty sure everyone owns that one.

10:45.280 --> 10:51.520
I think actually if you go to Netflix and you search and you type in M-A-I-D space,

10:51.520 --> 10:55.680
I-N space, M-A, it just comes up.

10:55.680 --> 10:59.360
No, I'm not going to let you because I care about you.

10:59.360 --> 11:00.800
No, it'll come up.

11:01.520 --> 11:04.720
Actually, Julia family account, it's 3 p.m. on a Sunday.

11:04.720 --> 11:07.120
This is not the right time to watch Made in Manhattan.

11:07.840 --> 11:08.960
This isn't your moment.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.240
We have locked it.

11:10.240 --> 11:11.760
Maybe try again on Saturday.

11:11.760 --> 11:13.360
Get some of your girls together.

11:14.000 --> 11:21.280
Maybe get a bottle of naked, and let's get this train rolling.

11:21.280 --> 11:29.280
I think the best time to watch it is when you've recently had some sort of heartbreak,

11:30.880 --> 11:37.760
no, like a love heart, not like a loss of a family friend, but like a loss of love.

11:37.760 --> 11:47.520
When your heart is breaking and you think that there's no goodness left on this earth,

11:47.520 --> 11:52.080
that is the moment for Made in Manhattan,

11:52.080 --> 11:55.600
or also if you just want to masturbate to Matthew McConaughey.

11:55.600 --> 11:56.960
Either one is fine.

11:56.960 --> 11:57.440
Sure.

11:57.440 --> 12:03.280
Well, for me, I don't know about you guys, those two events are not mutually exclusive.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.080
Wow, that is an excellent point.

12:06.080 --> 12:11.440
Typically one is, in fact, they're almost always paired, like a Napoleon.

12:11.440 --> 12:18.320
You know, I think the perfect time to watch Made in Manhattan is during a bachelor party,

12:19.360 --> 12:22.400
and tell your friends that you got a real hot and sexy movie to watch.

12:22.960 --> 12:24.720
Boom, Made in Manhattan.

12:24.720 --> 12:27.200
You think that that is what's going to set this party off?

12:27.200 --> 12:28.480
You think that's going to set a bachelor party on fire?

12:28.480 --> 12:31.760
Well, you know, a bachelor party, sometimes it can be all about the debauch,

12:31.760 --> 12:32.640
you know what I mean?

12:32.640 --> 12:38.560
More like debauchiller party, but then maybe you just need something to remind you

12:38.560 --> 12:42.080
how lucky the groom is to have found love in this crazy mixed up world.

12:42.080 --> 12:47.360
You're saying, Travis, that maybe you just need to cool down.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.400
Yeah, a bachelor party cool down.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.400
It's an effective time to watch Made in Manhattan.

12:52.400 --> 12:59.280
Oh, you should make it like that, the Dickens book from Lost that Desmond didn't want to read

12:59.280 --> 13:05.600
until he knew he was about to die, so he would save it for the last moment of his life.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.920
That's what you should do for Made in Manhattan.

13:07.920 --> 13:08.640
Oh, my God.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.000
It should be your death movie.

13:10.880 --> 13:13.120
Like, the fucking asteroid's coming.

13:13.120 --> 13:16.640
It'll be here and it'll be here in 110 minutes.

13:16.640 --> 13:19.200
Like, perfo, perfo.

13:19.200 --> 13:20.880
This is going to be great.

13:20.880 --> 13:23.360
This is the moment I've been waiting for my entire life.

13:24.560 --> 13:26.800
And then the tape is jammed.

13:29.520 --> 13:30.880
There would have been time now.

13:31.920 --> 13:34.880
I had all the time in the world to watch Made in Manhattan.

13:34.880 --> 13:39.200
The government has got the NASA has figured out a way to stop the asteroid,

13:39.200 --> 13:42.960
but it involves shooting every copy of Made in Manhattan

13:42.960 --> 13:45.600
into the asteroid's heart and blowing it up.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.160
Not my copy.

13:49.760 --> 13:51.280
I'm sorry, the event has failed.

13:51.280 --> 13:55.200
Someone has slipped a copy of the backup plan into the missile.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.360
They put it in the MRA.

13:57.360 --> 14:01.680
They put it in the Made in Manhattan MRA as if we wouldn't notice, but the meteor noticed.

14:02.400 --> 14:03.520
The meteor knows.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.120
We're all going to die.

14:05.120 --> 14:07.120
Thanks, Julia family account.

14:08.960 --> 14:10.000
Hey brothers.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.720
I'm a 20 year old university student putting myself through school

14:12.720 --> 14:14.560
who's not digging it that much.

14:14.560 --> 14:19.680
And I just received the news that I will be receiving 35 to $50,000 unexpectedly.

14:19.680 --> 14:20.080
Whoa.

14:20.080 --> 14:23.200
This is a life changing amount of money for me.

14:23.200 --> 14:23.440
Wow.

14:23.440 --> 14:23.680
Yeah.

14:24.720 --> 14:25.840
Unaccustomed to wealth.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.480
I haven't told anyone yet.

14:28.480 --> 14:29.760
I intend to keep the list short.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.680
Is it worth it to seek out advice?

14:31.680 --> 14:35.120
Or should I just go ham and follow my dreams?

14:36.640 --> 14:39.920
Is this $35,000 coming from a Nigerian prince?

14:40.720 --> 14:41.840
That is a good question.

14:42.480 --> 14:46.480
Are you getting are this is important because you haven't finished school yet.

14:46.480 --> 14:51.280
So maybe you haven't picked up the brain skills required to figure out

14:51.280 --> 14:52.640
whether you're getting fucked or not.

14:52.640 --> 14:53.920
But are you getting fucked?

14:53.920 --> 15:00.000
I mean, I don't want to pry, but where do you unexpectedly get 35 to $50,000?

15:00.720 --> 15:01.440
Doesn't matter.

15:01.440 --> 15:05.120
We got to focus on what to do with it.

15:07.040 --> 15:10.640
Here's what you need to make peace with right now in your own heart and mind.

15:12.400 --> 15:13.920
This money is transient.

15:13.920 --> 15:16.560
You're not going to be able to hold on to this lump of cash.

15:16.560 --> 15:17.440
Oh, fuck that.

15:17.440 --> 15:17.920
Fuck that.

15:17.920 --> 15:18.240
No way.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.840
You go live in the woods.

15:19.840 --> 15:22.240
You go pick up a trade skill and live in the woods.

15:22.240 --> 15:24.480
You can live off $50,000 for the rest of your life.

15:24.480 --> 15:25.280
Get off the grid.

15:25.280 --> 15:25.760
Real talk.

15:25.760 --> 15:26.560
No, real talk.

15:26.560 --> 15:27.360
Here's what you need to do.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.200
You need to take that 35 to $50,000.

15:29.200 --> 15:36.000
You need to put it in a savings account and then forget about it for like 15 years and

15:36.000 --> 15:36.800
then boom.

15:36.800 --> 15:37.600
One day.

15:37.600 --> 15:38.560
Oh, shit.

15:38.560 --> 15:41.760
We've had, you know, I need a down payment on the house.

15:41.760 --> 15:43.280
I mean, my car exploded.

15:43.280 --> 15:44.080
I know Paul.

15:44.800 --> 15:47.440
He's not going to live 15 years.

15:48.160 --> 15:48.800
He's got to.

15:48.800 --> 15:50.240
He's got to make money.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.200
He's going to die.

15:51.200 --> 15:51.920
He's going to die.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.920
I didn't want it to be like this, but I had a privilege.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.600
This is how you tell me about Paul?

15:57.600 --> 16:02.720
I cast the bones last night and I saw in them that Paul is going to die.

16:02.720 --> 16:08.480
Man, I bet Paul loaded up this episode and did not know what he was doing.

16:08.480 --> 16:11.200
Paul was so hypothetically young in 15 years.

16:11.200 --> 16:15.680
I just hope he's not one of these guys that stockpiles episodes and watches.

16:15.680 --> 16:17.200
I'll get to that one.

16:17.200 --> 16:19.440
No, I've listened to a lot of sockets.

16:19.440 --> 16:25.280
If you know Paul, if you know anyone named Paul, just burn him a CD with some of your

16:25.280 --> 16:26.160
favorite episodes.

16:26.160 --> 16:28.720
But especially this one, you should dip into this.

16:28.720 --> 16:37.680
Wait, unless unless unless this is like the ring and once Paul listens to this episode,

16:37.680 --> 16:39.760
that's when the timer starts on.

16:39.760 --> 16:45.920
Oh, it's like a self-fulfilling prophecy because you said 15 years, 15 years from now, like

16:45.920 --> 16:47.920
Paul's just going to start living recklessly.

16:48.480 --> 16:49.760
No, no, no.

16:49.760 --> 16:51.600
Travis obviously has not seen the movie.

16:51.600 --> 16:58.480
I think it would be like one Paul listens to the movie and the only way they can save

16:58.480 --> 17:01.120
themselves is to have another Paul listen to it.

17:01.120 --> 17:07.200
Guys, this is not only totally horrifying, this is going to be the greatest like promotional

17:07.200 --> 17:13.440
campaign we or any other media thing has ever been associated with.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.720
Oh, are you or anyone you know named Paul?

17:16.720 --> 17:18.000
It's limited to just Paul's.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.360
Yeah, our Paul growth is going to be our Lipson.

17:21.360 --> 17:25.600
It's going to be like your top demographics are New York City, California and Paul's.

17:25.600 --> 17:28.960
Paul's that very, very scared Paul's on a very tight timetable.

17:30.160 --> 17:39.040
Gosh, I was looking at the bones again and I misread them and I think everybody's going

17:39.040 --> 17:41.760
to die here in this episode.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.360
Wait, what's going to happen?

17:43.360 --> 17:48.720
The bones say especially people named Paul because like you got to get the groundswell

17:48.720 --> 17:52.000
started somewhere and I think Paul's going to die super hard.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.320
Paul should feel a sense of immediacy.

17:54.320 --> 17:56.400
Paul's get three days before they die.

17:56.400 --> 18:04.720
But Trevor's, Douglas's, Hank's, Marie's, Susan's, Alyssa's are actually fine.

18:04.720 --> 18:06.080
Alyssa's are okay.

18:06.080 --> 18:09.200
When the shit hits the fan, they are going to be the only ones left standing.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.520
Everybody else, you're going to die if you don't share the show with someone.

18:11.520 --> 18:13.280
I'm sorry.

18:13.280 --> 18:14.880
I'm sorry you had to find out like this.

18:14.880 --> 18:15.200
Okay.

18:15.200 --> 18:17.520
Jump back to what to do with this money.

18:17.520 --> 18:17.760
Paul.

18:17.760 --> 18:18.000
Okay.

18:18.000 --> 18:18.640
Here's the thing.

18:18.640 --> 18:25.040
Imagine the comfort, the brain comfort you could live in knowing that you at all times

18:25.040 --> 18:28.080
in your life have like a $50,000 question.

18:28.080 --> 18:28.880
That would be pretty sweet.

18:29.840 --> 18:30.320
Yeah.

18:30.320 --> 18:30.560
Right?

18:30.560 --> 18:31.280
That's a good point.

18:31.280 --> 18:31.520
Yeah.

18:31.520 --> 18:38.480
You know what would be great though is if you also bought like a thousand PlayStation Force.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.640
That would be sweet too.

18:40.640 --> 18:41.360
That would be pretty cool.

18:41.360 --> 18:44.400
And then just kind of handed them out to people like Oprah.

18:44.400 --> 18:44.960
Yeah.

18:44.960 --> 18:45.920
Did you say Oprah?

18:46.720 --> 18:48.720
Well, to each his own.

18:49.360 --> 18:50.320
No, it's not.

18:50.320 --> 18:54.480
She has her, she has a pretty preset way of like doing her name.

18:56.080 --> 18:56.480
I don't think-

18:56.480 --> 18:57.200
A little hope in it.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.800
It's not up to interpretation.

18:58.800 --> 19:02.080
Every Oprah's got a little hope in it.

19:08.320 --> 19:08.960
Seven days.

19:09.520 --> 19:10.720
Clock's ticking.

19:10.720 --> 19:13.360
Can you, should this person drop out of school?

19:13.360 --> 19:16.720
It sounds like that they are asking for us to give them permission to drop out of school.

19:16.720 --> 19:17.520
No.

19:17.520 --> 19:18.000
No.

19:18.000 --> 19:23.520
What you need to do is have your own local shark tank where you have business owners

19:23.520 --> 19:24.080
come over.

19:24.800 --> 19:27.440
But you only give out loans of like $1,500.

19:27.440 --> 19:27.840
Yeah.

19:27.840 --> 19:29.360
$1,500 is the max.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.040
You play hard ball.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.480
You listen to their pitch about their, I don't know, lemonade stand or whatever they want

19:36.480 --> 19:37.200
to make.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.120
And then you get them in debt to you.

19:39.120 --> 19:44.560
Like, hey man, man, I will invest 1.5% in your company.

19:44.560 --> 19:51.920
Hey man, I was down a big lots yesterday and they had this, they had this Cavaliers windbreaker

19:51.920 --> 19:55.760
suit and I would, I would really like to get my hands on that.

19:55.760 --> 19:56.640
It was $35.

19:56.640 --> 19:57.360
What do you say, Dave?

19:57.920 --> 19:59.280
What do you say, what do you say, Paul?

19:59.920 --> 20:03.440
Well, listen, I, I, I, you know, I love the Cavs.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.360
I love wind suits.

20:05.360 --> 20:08.960
Uh, but the, the, the valuation is way off on this.

20:08.960 --> 20:12.400
It is not, this whole wind suit is not worth $35.

20:12.400 --> 20:15.120
What I'm going to give you is $10 for 50%.

20:15.120 --> 20:21.120
I guess I can get the other 25 from, I guess, I guess I can like pay some driveways or something,

20:21.120 --> 20:26.560
but I would really like the 35 to just, I'm just, someone's going to just scoop in and

20:26.560 --> 20:27.120
snatch it up.

20:27.120 --> 20:27.920
You know what I mean?

20:27.920 --> 20:31.440
I can offer you 10% on the, the wind suit.

20:31.440 --> 20:32.880
I can give you like a pant leg.

20:32.880 --> 20:34.160
I can give you like a pant leg.

20:35.520 --> 20:35.840
All right.

20:35.840 --> 20:36.480
I think we got a deal.

20:38.400 --> 20:41.280
Mark Cuban comes in and he's like, I'll do it.

20:41.280 --> 20:42.560
I'll do it for free.

20:42.560 --> 20:44.640
That guy doesn't know fucking anything about business.

20:45.200 --> 20:45.920
Yeah.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.280
Paul, get your head in the game.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.080
Get your head in the game.

20:48.080 --> 20:54.240
Your, your objective with this money is to get as many halves of windbreakers as you can.

20:54.240 --> 20:57.520
And I think you can really stretch it if you, if you do it that way.

20:57.520 --> 20:58.000
I would.

20:58.000 --> 21:02.160
Well, don't stretch the windbreaker cause it's a very, now it's very fragile fabric.

21:02.160 --> 21:04.480
Very fissile, very fissile material.

21:04.480 --> 21:08.000
I would watch the fuck out of local shark tank.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.080
I would watch the fuck out of it.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.240
It doesn't even have to be Austin.

21:12.240 --> 21:13.280
It can be anywhere.

21:13.280 --> 21:14.400
I would watch it to death.

21:15.920 --> 21:18.080
Just somebody get that together for me.

21:18.640 --> 21:19.440
Thank you.

21:19.440 --> 21:20.240
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

21:22.000 --> 21:23.520
This Yahoo was sent in by Eric.

21:23.520 --> 21:24.080
I do.

21:24.080 --> 21:24.400
I do.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.000
I shouldn't have spoken for Travis.

21:26.000 --> 21:26.400
Thank you.

21:27.040 --> 21:28.160
I will allow it.

21:28.160 --> 21:33.680
This Yahoo was sent in by Eric or Bachi ball or Bachi ball.

21:33.680 --> 21:34.240
This is thank you.

21:34.240 --> 21:34.880
Eric Bachi ball.

21:34.880 --> 21:37.120
It's by Yahoo answers user.

21:38.160 --> 21:39.840
Gothic skater boy loves.

21:41.520 --> 21:42.000
That's me.

21:43.840 --> 21:48.240
Is asked by Travis who asks Christian dads.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.600
Would you let me date your daughter?

21:50.320 --> 21:53.120
So already like not off to a great start.

21:53.120 --> 21:54.960
Yeah, not, not super good.

21:54.960 --> 22:00.240
And well, I'm meeting my girlfriend's dad this summer and I have reason to believe he

22:00.240 --> 22:01.120
is very religious.

22:01.120 --> 22:04.720
So yeah, here's some questions he might ask and how I will answer.

22:05.840 --> 22:10.720
So everybody put your, put yourself in the shoes of Ted Christian dad.

22:14.480 --> 22:15.840
My name is Ted Christian dad.

22:17.680 --> 22:19.840
What is your goal in life answer?

22:19.840 --> 22:24.720
Well, I'm planning to get a band and try to get discovered making post hardcore and maybe

22:24.720 --> 22:26.000
even make my own clothing line.

22:26.000 --> 22:32.240
But if that doesn't work, maybe you already blew it trying to major in music.

22:32.800 --> 22:33.200
Okay.

22:33.200 --> 22:34.240
All those are bad.

22:34.240 --> 22:34.640
Go on.

22:34.640 --> 22:36.320
Those are all bad answer.

22:36.320 --> 22:40.240
Did you try to find the worst answer you could possibly find?

22:40.240 --> 22:42.400
There wasn't a single good word in there.

22:42.400 --> 22:43.600
The band thing.

22:43.600 --> 22:44.240
Really?

22:44.240 --> 22:44.800
They may be.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.240
Maybe he's a progressive.

22:46.240 --> 22:48.400
Ted may be an extremely progressive Christian dad.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.000
You don't know Ted.

22:50.000 --> 22:50.720
That's what I'm saying.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.400
Keep an open, keep an open mind.

22:52.400 --> 22:52.960
Let it all.

22:52.960 --> 22:53.440
Okay.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.160
All right.

22:54.160 --> 22:55.840
Are you a Christian answer?

22:55.840 --> 22:56.960
I'm not sure about that.

22:56.960 --> 23:00.800
I'm only a teenager and still trying to find out who I really am.

23:00.800 --> 23:05.200
And I think one can't know whether they're Christian or not until they truly know who

23:05.200 --> 23:05.840
they are.

23:05.840 --> 23:06.960
Can't argue with that.

23:06.960 --> 23:07.360
I'm sorry.

23:07.360 --> 23:08.160
Skater boy loves.

23:08.160 --> 23:09.840
Could you say that one more time?

23:09.840 --> 23:12.720
I couldn't hear you over the sound of me puking in my mouth.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.400
Listen, he's trying to figure shit out.

23:14.400 --> 23:17.040
Skater boy skater boy loves based on his profile picture.

23:17.040 --> 23:19.200
I'm guessing 15, 16 years old.

23:19.200 --> 23:22.400
Which, 15, 16 year olds, don't put pictures of yourself on the internet.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.560
You're not, you're not ready for that.

23:26.080 --> 23:28.320
He's trying to figure some shit out and there's no shame in that.

23:28.320 --> 23:31.040
He's putting himself out there because he's obviously fallen very deeply in love.

23:31.040 --> 23:35.600
Well, then when Ted Christian dad says, hey, are you a Christian?

23:35.600 --> 23:37.040
He should be like, nah, pops.

23:38.000 --> 23:38.720
But he doesn't.

23:38.720 --> 23:39.440
No, that's what I'm saying.

23:41.440 --> 23:45.280
We need to get through this because you guys are making me angry with your prejudgments.

23:46.480 --> 23:48.000
My person to ask is,

23:48.000 --> 23:51.040
I just want to add to your point, Griffin.

23:51.040 --> 23:54.080
15, 16 year olds shouldn't put anything on the internet.

23:54.080 --> 23:54.720
Not just pictures.

23:54.720 --> 23:55.440
No, exactly.

23:55.440 --> 23:58.320
Some internet tough guys will come along and make fun of you.

23:58.320 --> 24:01.280
Yeah, unless the thing that you're putting on the internet is you like,

24:01.920 --> 24:06.240
like falling off a table or like, I don't know, setting your hair on fire or something.

24:06.240 --> 24:07.120
That's pretty good.

24:07.120 --> 24:07.920
That's good stuff.

24:08.480 --> 24:09.600
My personality.

24:09.600 --> 24:10.880
Check this shit out.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.560
Sweet, funny, sensitive.

24:12.560 --> 24:16.720
The kind of guy that would put your daughter first and risk my life to keep her safe.

24:16.720 --> 24:17.520
What's up now?

24:17.520 --> 24:18.160
You fucks.

24:18.960 --> 24:21.680
You two fucks, Justin and Travis, specifically you two.

24:22.400 --> 24:23.600
Trying to shame this guy.

24:23.600 --> 24:24.240
Trying to put salt.

24:24.240 --> 24:25.200
Can you read it one more time?

24:25.200 --> 24:26.480
Could you read the answer one more time?

24:26.480 --> 24:28.800
Sweet, funny, sensitive.

24:28.800 --> 24:34.400
The kind of guy that would put your daughter first and would risk my life to keep her safe.

24:36.080 --> 24:37.360
Huh, that's weird.

24:37.360 --> 24:39.840
You guys seem a lot more quiet during that answer.

24:39.840 --> 24:41.360
Don't seem like you have a lot of...

24:41.360 --> 24:42.080
Oh, sorry.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.320
I was distracted.

24:45.040 --> 24:47.360
I was watching Made in Manhattan on my computer.

24:47.360 --> 24:50.240
I think that that's very sweet.

24:50.240 --> 24:53.760
And I think that that's all a father wants to hear, unless...

24:53.760 --> 24:54.160
Unless?

24:54.720 --> 25:05.200
Unless he is so deeply into Jesus that you have defined him by how deeply into Jesus he is.

25:06.000 --> 25:11.040
It seems to me that that is going to be a real deal breaker for him.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.280
I don't understand your point.

25:13.280 --> 25:18.320
If the kid is not into Jesus, he's not going to be down with him.

25:19.920 --> 25:25.760
It would be like if my dad was really, really into ICP.

25:25.760 --> 25:27.520
And so much so that if you were...

25:27.520 --> 25:29.760
Our dad is definitely, definitely a huge...

25:29.760 --> 25:31.040
Imagine the truth.

25:31.040 --> 25:32.080
Imagine the truth.

25:32.080 --> 25:37.680
And this dad is so deeply into ICP that when you talk about other people,

25:37.680 --> 25:39.440
like that is how you identify him.

25:39.440 --> 25:41.280
He's an ICP dad.

25:41.280 --> 25:44.000
If you come in and you're like, I don't know if I...

25:44.000 --> 25:48.800
I've taken Violet J into my heart yet because I'm still got a lot...

25:48.800 --> 25:49.840
He's going to be like, sure.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.720
You were unaffected at Juggalo Church Camp.

25:52.720 --> 25:54.960
You were not moved to come down to the fire and make a dedication.

25:54.960 --> 25:57.760
If you're not down with the clown, then you're not down with Stephanie.

25:57.760 --> 25:58.720
Now please go.

25:58.720 --> 26:02.640
We're painting Ted in a really negative light though.

26:02.640 --> 26:07.040
I don't think that Ted is the kind of dad that is like this single faceted.

26:07.040 --> 26:08.640
Let me say this kid's mistake.

26:08.640 --> 26:10.480
I think he's had a very negative life.

26:10.480 --> 26:14.640
I think maybe he plays...

26:14.640 --> 26:15.600
His name is Ted.

26:15.600 --> 26:19.440
I think Ted plays in the band at like a kind of a progressive church.

26:20.160 --> 26:21.920
A lot of newsboys covers.

26:21.920 --> 26:22.400
Yeah.

26:22.400 --> 26:23.440
A lot of DC talk.

26:24.320 --> 26:25.440
I think he's kind of hip.

26:25.440 --> 26:27.440
I think he knows what's up.

26:27.440 --> 26:29.520
He was like the first guy listening to Switchfoot.

26:30.160 --> 26:32.000
I think he knows what's up a little bit.

26:32.000 --> 26:32.480
So let's say...

26:32.480 --> 26:34.080
He enjoyed Arrested Development.

26:34.080 --> 26:36.000
He felt some of the material was a little blue.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.480
It was a little blue, but a lot of it was good-natured family fun.

26:40.480 --> 26:41.440
Political views.

26:41.440 --> 26:42.320
I don't have any.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.040
Gothic skater boy loves.

26:45.040 --> 26:48.240
I mean, I guess he's just walking this middle path on everything.

26:48.240 --> 26:52.080
At 50 to 16, that is the exact right answer.

26:52.080 --> 26:52.880
I don't know.

26:52.880 --> 26:53.920
I don't have any money.

26:54.480 --> 26:56.400
Here's Gothic skater boy loves problem.

26:56.400 --> 26:56.880
What's that?

26:57.920 --> 27:00.480
He's painting too good a picture.

27:01.040 --> 27:01.520
You know what I mean?

27:01.520 --> 27:06.080
When you say to a dad, I'm sweet, good-natured, kind, I care about your daughter.

27:06.080 --> 27:07.600
It's like, listen, you're 16.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.040
What's the shit?

27:09.040 --> 27:10.400
What aren't you telling me?

27:10.400 --> 27:11.440
I think what he means...

27:11.440 --> 27:16.000
You're saying every 16-year-old harbors a dark passenger.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.600
I mean, they have something.

27:17.600 --> 27:22.080
I'm saying what he needs is something that skews the attention away from the whole

27:22.080 --> 27:26.320
I don't know if I'm a Christian thing and take it to like a shoplift.

27:26.320 --> 27:27.920
You're telling me that sweet, funny, sensitive,

27:27.920 --> 27:29.040
the kind of guy that put your daughter first

27:29.040 --> 27:32.560
and would risk my life to keep her safe, that doesn't make up for that fact?

27:32.560 --> 27:34.160
Also, he's not saying he's not a Christian.

27:34.160 --> 27:35.600
He's saying he doesn't know yet.

27:35.600 --> 27:37.040
I'm saying you need to skew away.

27:37.040 --> 27:39.120
You need a mistake in the prayer rug, right?

27:39.120 --> 27:40.480
Because only God is perfect.

27:40.480 --> 27:43.680
So you need some fatal flaw, something that says like,

27:43.680 --> 27:45.920
it's like when you go into a job interview and they always ask,

27:45.920 --> 27:47.040
what's your biggest weakness?

27:48.160 --> 27:49.360
Type of music I listen to.

27:49.360 --> 27:53.520
Well, I listen to stuff like Pierce the Veil, Sleeping with Sirens, Hawthorne Heights,

27:53.520 --> 27:57.120
My Chemical Romance of Mice and Men, Red Jumpsuit Apparatus.

27:57.120 --> 28:01.760
Oh, that's good, make up a bunch of bands and then Christian Ted won't know.

28:01.760 --> 28:05.760
A Day to Remember, Bring Me the Horizon, plus I listen to a lot of brony music.

28:07.120 --> 28:07.840
Oh, there it is.

28:08.640 --> 28:09.680
Oh, there it is.

28:09.680 --> 28:11.040
There's the flaw in the prayer rug.

28:11.040 --> 28:15.520
I listen to the Price is Right Losing theme song exclusively.

28:15.520 --> 28:16.960
That's the only song I listen to.

28:18.560 --> 28:20.800
Does brony music is a genre?

28:21.440 --> 28:22.400
I bet it's good.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.120
Is it just songs from the-

28:23.120 --> 28:24.240
I just want to get that out there.

28:24.240 --> 28:25.920
I bet it's energetic.

28:25.920 --> 28:30.480
Justin's just trying to get ahead of the fucking wave of emails that we're going to get.

28:30.480 --> 28:33.040
We got to take a stand against something sometime, guys.

28:33.040 --> 28:36.640
We're walking the middle road, just like fucking gothic skater boy loves.

28:36.640 --> 28:38.160
I'm not judging you bronies.

28:38.720 --> 28:41.920
I don't like that there's a specific genre of brony music.

28:41.920 --> 28:44.960
I think that is weird, but I love you.

28:44.960 --> 28:48.640
Video game music, the chip tune.

28:48.640 --> 28:50.560
That is it, but that's an exclusive.

28:50.560 --> 28:51.680
First of all, that shit's dope.

28:51.680 --> 28:56.000
That's an entire medium though.

28:56.000 --> 29:01.840
I don't think brony is like kind of a lifestyle in it, based on that show.

29:03.040 --> 29:08.640
I think brony music would be cool to write because if you get into a pinch,

29:08.640 --> 29:12.800
first off, there's so many My Little Ponies, finding a rhyme is always easy.

29:13.520 --> 29:19.600
Secondly, if you're like, I ate a butter tart,

29:19.600 --> 29:21.920
you know that you're just going to be able to dip into your bag

29:21.920 --> 29:24.800
and pick out like Flutter Heart or-

29:25.360 --> 29:26.080
Are you, Justin?

29:28.240 --> 29:28.560
What?

29:29.200 --> 29:30.080
Wait, hold on.

29:30.080 --> 29:33.520
How are you this familiar with this universe?

29:33.520 --> 29:34.720
I actually made that one up.

29:34.720 --> 29:35.760
That one came from my-

29:36.560 --> 29:37.760
Your own Flutter Heart?

29:37.760 --> 29:39.040
From my own Flutter Heart.

29:39.040 --> 29:41.280
I made up Flutter Heart, so it may not be real.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.320
Don't make me get-

29:42.320 --> 29:43.760
Hey, quick quiz, hotshot.

29:43.760 --> 29:45.760
Name three My Little Ponies right now.

29:47.200 --> 29:49.040
This is what I'm saying to you.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.880
That's not a good quiz.

29:50.880 --> 29:51.680
You're trying to-

29:51.680 --> 29:53.760
No, I started it with quick quiz, hotshots.

29:53.760 --> 29:55.280
You're supposed to answer without thinking.

29:55.280 --> 29:56.240
Let's try again.

29:56.240 --> 29:57.360
Quick quiz, hotshot.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.040
Three My Little Ponies right now.

29:59.040 --> 30:01.040
Long face, sweet stuff.

30:02.960 --> 30:03.520
Kirsten.

30:05.200 --> 30:06.400
I knew you were a brony.

30:07.680 --> 30:12.000
Those are the three most popular, least well-known My Little Ponies.

30:12.000 --> 30:12.640
How I dress.

30:13.360 --> 30:16.560
Most of the time I wear skinny jeans and banties with a beanie and Vans.

30:16.560 --> 30:20.320
Uh, but most other times I might want to go with a different look.

30:20.320 --> 30:25.200
So I wear stuff like hipster glasses, fedoras, v-neck, and skinny jeans.

30:25.840 --> 30:29.440
Duh, you should have stopped after I don't have political views.

30:30.240 --> 30:35.280
Why, why, why, why did he feel the need to include skinny jeans in both scenarios?

30:36.000 --> 30:38.160
No matter what, he's wearing skinny jeans.

30:38.160 --> 30:38.480
Do you-

30:38.480 --> 30:42.000
But sometimes I don't feel like wearing skinny jeans, so I just wear skinny jeans.

30:43.360 --> 30:44.960
Do you do drugs or drink?

30:44.960 --> 30:46.160
Well, no, I don't.

30:46.160 --> 30:48.160
I have better things to do than get high or drink.

30:48.160 --> 30:51.920
Like, dawg, based on your other answers, you wicked don't.

30:51.920 --> 30:54.160
Like, so far it sounds like you super don't.

30:54.800 --> 30:55.520
Yeah.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.040
Why not just answer that question?

30:57.040 --> 30:59.760
I would if I had any idea where to get it.

30:59.760 --> 31:00.800
I don't know how to get it.

31:00.800 --> 31:01.200
That's what someone asked me about.

31:01.200 --> 31:02.560
I mean, I'm 16, dawg.

31:03.680 --> 31:08.560
But I don't know where the window is because I'm 33 and I don't know how to get drugs at all.

31:08.560 --> 31:09.120
I don't either.

31:09.120 --> 31:09.920
Have any.

31:09.920 --> 31:13.280
If you live in Austin, Texas, let me- send me a Facebook message or something.

31:13.280 --> 31:15.360
I don't think anybody in Austin does weed.

31:15.360 --> 31:16.960
No, that's probably true.

31:16.960 --> 31:21.760
Interest, music, tattoos, sleep, Facebook, piercings, Van's Warp Tour.

31:21.760 --> 31:25.200
Okay, so according to the answers I gave, would you let me date your daughter?

31:25.200 --> 31:26.320
Justin, final answer?

31:28.720 --> 31:29.200
Kirsten.

31:30.080 --> 31:30.560
Travis?

31:32.960 --> 31:34.960
Yes, I would require her to.

31:34.960 --> 31:35.460
Okay.

31:36.480 --> 31:41.520
I want to make a point about gothic skater boy loves.

31:41.520 --> 31:42.320
Is that what it is?

31:42.320 --> 31:42.720
That's right.

31:42.720 --> 31:49.680
I think- I think he is not a person, but I think he-

31:49.680 --> 31:50.880
I'm like, he's an idea?

31:51.440 --> 31:55.200
No, he's a conceptual demographic created by a marketing department.

31:55.200 --> 31:57.760
Kevin, can you tell me about the things he likes again?

31:58.560 --> 32:04.720
Music, tattoos, sleep, Facebook, piercings, Van's Warp Tour.

32:05.440 --> 32:11.440
So someone turned a Hot Topics store into a sentient human being.

32:11.440 --> 32:11.680
Yeah.

32:11.680 --> 32:12.320
Yeah.

32:12.320 --> 32:14.160
And asked, can I date your daughter?

32:14.160 --> 32:15.360
No, you're a brand.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.440
You're not even a person.

32:17.440 --> 32:17.920
You're a brand.

32:17.920 --> 32:18.480
What do you like?

32:18.480 --> 32:22.240
A Super Mario mushroom tease, novelty dice.

32:22.240 --> 32:26.160
A spiked up poster where the girl's kind of pouring milk over her boobs.

32:26.160 --> 32:28.560
Things with sloths from the Goonies on it.

32:30.240 --> 32:32.800
Old Nickelodeon television show logos.

32:32.800 --> 32:34.240
Studded leather bracelets.

32:36.560 --> 32:37.440
Can I date your daughter?

32:37.440 --> 32:38.880
Here's what I'm into.

32:38.880 --> 32:41.920
Black light posters, things that make fart noises.

32:43.280 --> 32:44.560
No Spencer's gifts.

32:44.560 --> 32:45.600
Get out of here.

32:45.600 --> 32:46.960
Those little plasma balls.

32:49.520 --> 32:50.640
Can I date your daughter?

32:50.640 --> 32:51.520
Things I'm into.

32:51.520 --> 32:56.720
Little glass unicorns, tiny pewter figurines, engraved flasks.

32:56.720 --> 33:01.040
Travis, I love you, but I don't think Excalibur is a chain.

33:02.240 --> 33:05.440
I was actually going for things remembered, but thank you.

33:05.440 --> 33:06.560
Can I date your daughter?

33:06.560 --> 33:07.440
Things I'm into.

33:07.440 --> 33:08.160
Pretzels.

33:08.160 --> 33:09.520
Pretzels, cinnamon pretzels.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.440
Pretzels with hot dogs in them.

33:11.440 --> 33:14.480
Sweet pretzels, savory pretzels, spicy pretzels.

33:15.040 --> 33:17.360
Well, you can't date my daughter because you're her aunt.

33:17.920 --> 33:18.720
Oh, that's good.

33:21.680 --> 33:25.680
Does everybody have a store at their mall like Excalibur?

33:25.680 --> 33:26.800
Like, is that a thing?

33:27.440 --> 33:28.880
Can you explain what fucking Excalibur?

33:28.880 --> 33:31.520
Like, there are four people getting this deep cut.

33:31.520 --> 33:34.880
This is a store that sells, okay, in the-

33:34.880 --> 33:37.120
I actually think we've talked about it before.

33:37.120 --> 33:39.040
Really? But it's been a while.

33:39.040 --> 33:40.720
It's got loads of glass figurines.

33:41.280 --> 33:45.200
It's got, like, a lot of pewter dragons.

33:45.200 --> 33:46.000
A lot of that.

33:46.640 --> 33:48.320
A lot of glass figurines.

33:48.320 --> 33:49.360
A lot of ornaments.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.840
And on the back wall is just filled with swords.

33:52.480 --> 33:53.600
Like, I don't-

33:53.600 --> 33:56.800
And, like, throwing stars and, like, katana.

33:56.800 --> 33:58.000
Ninja weaponry.

33:58.000 --> 34:04.400
And then in the front, decorative chachis.

34:04.400 --> 34:06.000
A lot of Marilyn Monroe.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.280
A lot of James Dean.

34:07.280 --> 34:08.880
Then on the back wall, swords.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.080
That's Excalibur.

34:10.080 --> 34:12.000
Chachis in the front, murder in the back.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.080
I didn't want to tell you guys this, but Excalibur closed.

34:15.280 --> 34:15.600
I know.

34:15.600 --> 34:16.080
It turned it-

34:16.080 --> 34:18.560
But it turned into a yogurt place.

34:18.560 --> 34:20.080
That sells swords.

34:20.080 --> 34:22.000
And then just ninja weapons on the back wall.

34:22.000 --> 34:22.240
Yeah.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.160
They couldn't get the swords off the wall.

34:24.160 --> 34:25.680
Apparently those were for decoration.

34:25.680 --> 34:38.160
Hey, let's go to the money zone.

34:38.160 --> 34:40.000
Griffin, who's our first message for?

34:40.000 --> 34:40.400
I don't know.

34:41.680 --> 34:42.880
It's for Sam Ludwig.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.240
Who's it from, Griffin?

34:44.960 --> 34:45.440
Oh, God.

34:46.880 --> 34:47.360
Travis.

34:47.360 --> 34:48.320
From Will Ludwig.

34:48.320 --> 34:49.360
Stumpers.

34:49.360 --> 34:50.880
Go to the head of the class.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.160
Hey, Sammy.

34:52.160 --> 34:54.400
I didn't get you a present you can grab with your hands,

34:54.400 --> 34:56.640
so here's one you can hear with your ears.

34:56.640 --> 34:59.920
Now hurry up and get a PS4 so we can play some games.

34:59.920 --> 35:02.800
This episode brought to you by PlayStation 4.

35:03.440 --> 35:05.280
Crash Bandicoot 5.

35:05.280 --> 35:06.480
Grab the wave.

35:09.040 --> 35:15.040
We got another one to Lori Renner from Halstead Hal Larson.

35:16.880 --> 35:18.080
Travis, read it.

35:18.080 --> 35:19.440
Lori, happy birthday.

35:19.440 --> 35:20.720
If you're in Denver-

35:20.720 --> 35:21.360
Wait, hold on.

35:21.360 --> 35:24.800
If you're in Denver, I hope this message finds you well,

35:24.800 --> 35:27.280
having fun and getting a badass tattoo.

35:27.280 --> 35:30.080
If you're back east with me, then I'll see you shortly.

35:30.080 --> 35:31.680
I love you so damn much.

35:31.680 --> 35:35.200
I don't think there's anyone else who could have road pizza with me

35:35.200 --> 35:38.400
on the way back from West Virginia so we can get our Pokemon in time.

35:39.520 --> 35:42.000
There was a lot of things I really liked in that last sentence.

35:43.200 --> 35:45.840
That last sentence was one of the best sentences ever crafted.

35:45.840 --> 35:47.200
Congratulations.

35:47.200 --> 35:49.280
Hal and Lori came to my show.

35:50.000 --> 35:50.560
Oh, cool.

35:50.560 --> 35:51.440
Superman.

35:51.440 --> 35:52.960
Yeah, it came all the way out there.

35:52.960 --> 35:54.080
The good people.

35:54.080 --> 35:58.400
And this is a message for Lori.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.400
So I hope she really likes it.

36:00.400 --> 36:03.120
And I hope she has a great day.

36:03.120 --> 36:04.480
Tweet at me if you want to trade or battle.

36:07.520 --> 36:08.020
Please do.

36:09.040 --> 36:10.800
Guys, I'm so hungry.

36:12.880 --> 36:14.960
Well, it's like seven in the morning.

36:14.960 --> 36:15.920
Go eat breakfast.

36:15.920 --> 36:18.880
I got those mid-afternoon munchers.

36:18.880 --> 36:20.320
No, it's not mid-afternoon.

36:20.320 --> 36:21.760
No, you don't have those at all.

36:21.760 --> 36:23.440
I got those right now.

36:23.440 --> 36:24.080
Okay.

36:24.080 --> 36:26.480
I got mid-afternoon munchers and I don't know what to do.

36:26.480 --> 36:27.520
I'm cranking them.

36:27.520 --> 36:32.400
Are you going to eat like some cheesecake or like some really fatty cookies?

36:33.360 --> 36:34.880
Them cheesy blasters?

36:34.880 --> 36:40.000
I went to the cheesecake machine, but it didn't accept my 20s on my Cougarands.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.640
So I can't get anything from the cheesecake machine.

36:42.640 --> 36:45.360
Even if I did, it would, you know, just make me fat.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.200
Let me throw this out, Jase.

36:48.880 --> 36:50.080
Nature box.

36:50.080 --> 36:51.440
Nature box.

36:51.440 --> 36:52.880
Greatness awaits.

36:52.880 --> 36:55.520
Griffin, tell me about nature box.

36:55.520 --> 36:59.920
Nature box is a box that has great tasting and healthy snacks in it

36:59.920 --> 37:03.680
that you send that you get sent to your door through internet.

37:03.680 --> 37:07.440
And then from your door, it all goes in your mouth and you got it.

37:07.440 --> 37:08.480
It tastes good.

37:08.480 --> 37:09.760
It's got bags.

37:09.760 --> 37:10.560
It's nature stuff.

37:10.560 --> 37:11.760
So it's like rabbit food.

37:11.760 --> 37:14.000
Shut your fucking idiot mouth.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.440
Some alfalfa sprouts.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.960
Now we're talking French toast, French toast, granola,

37:18.960 --> 37:23.360
salted caramel pretzel pops, dark cacao almonds, and more.

37:23.360 --> 37:25.360
All designed to leave you full and healthy.

37:27.360 --> 37:32.160
If they can leave me healthy, I will buy their entire stock.

37:34.240 --> 37:37.920
Guys, yesterday I had vanilla, macaroon, granola.

37:37.920 --> 37:39.040
Shit, that sounds good.

37:39.040 --> 37:41.680
That took me to flavor town.

37:41.680 --> 37:43.440
Anyway, go to naturebox.com.

37:44.560 --> 37:47.360
You put together your own box using whatever snacks you want.

37:47.360 --> 37:50.640

37:50.640 --> 37:53.520

37:53.520 --> 37:55.280

37:59.200 --> 38:02.960

38:03.920 --> 38:06.400

38:06.400 --> 38:08.400
Yeah, pass those over to us.

38:08.400 --> 38:09.840
So go to naturebox.com.

38:09.840 --> 38:12.560
You get great healthy snacks, 50% off your first order.

38:12.560 --> 38:15.920
Go to naturebox.com and use the promo code MYBROTHER.

38:15.920 --> 38:18.960
Normally when I'm eating, I like to stare at a wall in silence

38:18.960 --> 38:21.040
and just listen to myself crunch or chew.

38:21.760 --> 38:24.800
But sometimes I like to mix it up with a little bit of television.

38:26.480 --> 38:26.720
Okay.

38:26.720 --> 38:27.840
You know, when I do that.

38:27.840 --> 38:28.560
Okay, thanks.

38:29.360 --> 38:29.760
But I-

38:29.760 --> 38:31.360
Do you want to read the next ad?

38:31.360 --> 38:35.200
But I have my house led shielded from TV signals.

38:35.200 --> 38:35.760
Okay.

38:35.760 --> 38:38.000
And I think cable is run by the FBI.

38:40.080 --> 38:43.280
So I can't watch traditional television, but there's a good news

38:43.280 --> 38:46.800
because I'm wheezing off my neighbor's Wi-Fi

38:46.800 --> 38:49.120
and I can get into Hulu Plus.

38:49.120 --> 38:49.920
Okay.

38:49.920 --> 38:52.000
That was a lot of stuff you just did there.

38:53.200 --> 38:54.800
It streams in HD.

38:54.800 --> 38:58.480
Even if the Wi-Fi signal is coming through two walls,

38:59.680 --> 39:00.320
you can still-

39:00.320 --> 39:01.920
One of which is made out of tinfoil.

39:04.000 --> 39:04.720
They got everything.

39:04.720 --> 39:06.720
Saturday Night Live, Community, Family Guy.

39:07.440 --> 39:09.360
Actually, those are the only three shows they have.

39:09.360 --> 39:10.240
That's not true.

39:10.240 --> 39:12.160
I think the service is going to grow from there.

39:12.160 --> 39:17.040
They've got original series like The Awesomes and Moon Boy

39:17.040 --> 39:19.200
starring Chris O'Dowd from Bridesmaids.

39:19.200 --> 39:22.160
And also Thor, The Dark World.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.760
Twist, Turn Back Around.

39:23.760 --> 39:24.160
I'm not there yet.

39:24.160 --> 39:24.560
Stop.

39:24.560 --> 39:26.000
You're the shittiest at this.

39:26.800 --> 39:29.600
I'm just saying Chris O'Dowd is in Thor, The Dark World.

39:29.600 --> 39:30.080
Oh, really?

39:30.720 --> 39:34.800
So if you catch Chris O'Dowd fever from Thor Watch 2013-

39:34.800 --> 39:36.160
Then get checked.

39:36.160 --> 39:36.880
Then get checked.

39:36.880 --> 39:37.440
Get Hulu.

39:37.440 --> 39:41.440
For only $7.99 a month, you can stream as many TV shows as you want,

39:41.440 --> 39:44.160
but they don't need your money upfront because you're a friend of us.

39:44.160 --> 39:44.640
You're cool.

39:44.640 --> 39:45.680
You're with us.

39:45.680 --> 39:48.240
You're going to go to huluplus.com slash my brother.

39:48.880 --> 39:49.440
You're going to get-

39:49.440 --> 39:50.560
That's all one word together.

39:50.560 --> 39:54.560
Huluplus.com slash my brother and get two free weeks.

39:55.360 --> 39:58.880
Sergio Diaz plays in a band called Os Mutantes.

39:58.880 --> 40:02.960
His life was changed the first time he heard Elvis Presley.

40:02.960 --> 40:06.160
The great thing in the world, it is to discover.

40:06.160 --> 40:08.320
I mean, there's nothing better.

40:08.320 --> 40:09.280
I'm Jesse Thorne.

40:09.280 --> 40:12.160
My show Bullseye is about discovery.

40:12.160 --> 40:15.760
We help you find the best music, the best movies, the best books,

40:15.760 --> 40:17.920
and we talk to the people who make them.

40:17.920 --> 40:21.120
It's Bullseye from Maximumfun.org and NPR.

40:25.200 --> 40:26.080
Subway hacks.

40:29.360 --> 40:33.440
Throwback, throwback to last week on the subject of subway hacks.

40:33.440 --> 40:37.200
Real quick, we'll just knock this out real quick and we'll move on.

40:37.200 --> 40:39.600
One way you can hack a Subway is when you order a pizza sub,

40:39.600 --> 40:42.880
you can get a double cheese for free because if you look closely at the picture on the menu,

40:42.880 --> 40:46.640
there are enough pieces of cheese poking out that the sub is supposed to be made with double cheese.

40:46.640 --> 40:49.360
From there, you can argue that it's false advertising if they don't.

40:49.360 --> 40:53.760
Also, don't forget the Subway always has Parmesan cheese under the counter.

40:53.760 --> 40:55.920
No matter what they say, it's always there,

40:55.920 --> 40:58.240
even if they don't ask you if you want it under the sandwich.

40:58.240 --> 41:01.280
That's the DJ in BC, Canada.

41:01.280 --> 41:05.200
Why is everyone trying to fuck everyone else all the time?

41:05.200 --> 41:07.920
Uh, excuse me, Subway man.

41:07.920 --> 41:10.960
Um, I know you've got Parmesan cheese down there.

41:10.960 --> 41:12.640
My brother, my brother and me told me so.

41:12.640 --> 41:15.920
I didn't know that I could make cheese demands because I've never eaten anything

41:15.920 --> 41:17.920
where the cheese look like it looks like in the pit.

41:17.920 --> 41:19.760
It always looks like a fucking,

41:20.400 --> 41:24.320
like it's just been broiled by like artisanal French onion soup

41:24.320 --> 41:26.960
and it never, ever, ever actually looks like that.

41:26.960 --> 41:28.240
It's never caramelized.

41:29.840 --> 41:31.280
What kind of cheese would you like?

41:31.280 --> 41:32.480
Uh, brie, please.

41:32.480 --> 41:33.120
Brie, I know you have it.

41:33.120 --> 41:35.520
Okay, we have, we have white cheese.

41:35.520 --> 41:37.440
We have white, we have yellow.

41:37.440 --> 41:39.760
I know you got brie back there, motherfucker.

41:39.760 --> 41:41.680
Don't even try to trip.

41:41.680 --> 41:43.760
It's stingy on the monster.

41:43.760 --> 41:44.560
Do this next one.

41:45.680 --> 41:49.520
I'm a gay guy in my early twenties who occasionally uses Grindr,

41:49.520 --> 41:50.880
the gay focused dating app.

41:52.240 --> 41:53.600
Thanks, thanks guy.

41:53.600 --> 41:55.680
We, uh, we, uh, we are hip to Grindr.

41:55.680 --> 41:56.080
All right.

41:56.720 --> 42:00.720
Uh, to get my bang on and to pass the time on the bus on a board.

42:00.720 --> 42:03.520
Question is this, is it appropriate to message a friend you know,

42:03.520 --> 42:05.520
if you see him on Grindr?

42:05.520 --> 42:07.840
Not in an attempt to get it on just in like a,

42:07.840 --> 42:09.360
I see you there type of way.

42:09.360 --> 42:09.680
Hey.

42:09.680 --> 42:13.280
I have several friends message me like this and I find it uncomfortable.

42:13.280 --> 42:15.280
I'm out and I have no shame using Grindr,

42:15.280 --> 42:17.440
but it still feels like an invasion of privacy.

42:17.440 --> 42:19.680
Should I get over myself or should it be allowed?

42:19.680 --> 42:23.280
A semblance of privacy while looking for sex things.

42:23.280 --> 42:24.640
That's from Covert in Canada.

42:25.280 --> 42:29.120
Uh, PS, I once saw my middle school math teacher on Grindr

42:29.120 --> 42:31.600
looking for young hot power bottoms.

42:31.600 --> 42:32.960
I did not say hello.

42:32.960 --> 42:34.000
Then you fucked up.

42:34.960 --> 42:36.560
Then you fucked right up.

42:36.560 --> 42:37.600
Hey, Mr. Phillips.

42:37.600 --> 42:41.200
You, you, who wouldn't want to just blast Mr.

42:41.200 --> 42:42.960
Phillips for the story of it?

42:44.160 --> 42:46.080
Here's the problem, Covert in Canada.

42:46.080 --> 42:50.000
No, you don't get any privacy because you're on a website.

42:50.640 --> 42:52.480
Like you're not just like minding your own business.

42:52.480 --> 42:54.480
Listen to fucking Edward Snowden over here.

42:54.480 --> 42:54.640
Yeah.

42:54.640 --> 42:54.720
Wow.

42:54.720 --> 42:58.400
No, I'm just saying like, it's, it's not a privacy fit.

42:58.400 --> 43:01.440
You can't be like, I'm on this thing putting it out there.

43:01.440 --> 43:01.760
Yeah.

43:01.760 --> 43:02.480
Oh shit.

43:02.480 --> 43:03.120
Somebody found it.

43:03.120 --> 43:04.880
You're saying, you're saying that Grindr

43:04.880 --> 43:06.400
should be like the men's room.

43:07.120 --> 43:07.440
It is.

43:08.480 --> 43:10.320
Super is a men's room for men.

43:10.320 --> 43:12.000
It's a men's room for men only.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.600
No, it should be like the men's room where

43:13.600 --> 43:16.000
you know other people in the men's room,

43:16.000 --> 43:18.800
but you really should try not to acknowledge

43:18.800 --> 43:20.720
that you're both using the bathroom at the same time.

43:20.720 --> 43:21.200
Is that what you're saying?

43:21.200 --> 43:23.280
I guess, but how do you say that to your friends

43:23.280 --> 43:24.400
who like put you on blast and like,

43:24.400 --> 43:25.360
hey, I see you on there.

43:25.360 --> 43:26.480
How do you, how do you say like,

43:26.480 --> 43:30.640
like I recognize that, but could you pretend not like.

43:30.640 --> 43:32.480
The goofs that everyone does about Grindr,

43:32.480 --> 43:33.520
those are on point, right?

43:33.520 --> 43:35.680
Like I don't have this preconceived notion

43:35.680 --> 43:37.040
that is wrong about Grindr,

43:37.040 --> 43:39.280
about it just being like a fucking free

43:39.280 --> 43:40.880
for all fuck fest, right?

43:40.880 --> 43:43.200
That is what it, that is its intended purpose, right?

43:44.160 --> 43:48.320
You're saying it's not like a, a relationship building.

43:49.040 --> 43:51.520
That we're not taught, there's just site specific.

43:51.520 --> 43:53.520
Like if you're on Grindr, you're there to get down,

43:53.520 --> 43:54.960
not to start a relationship.

43:54.960 --> 43:55.360
Yeah.

43:55.360 --> 43:56.240
I don't, I don't know.

43:56.240 --> 43:57.520
I haven't used it myself.

43:57.520 --> 44:00.240
Well, they haven't sponsored us once they do.

44:00.240 --> 44:02.640
Oh shit, we will be all over that.

44:03.840 --> 44:06.320
I think it's a little touch and go.

44:06.960 --> 44:08.240
I think it's a little touch and go.

44:08.240 --> 44:09.600
No, that's a separate website.

44:14.320 --> 44:18.000
It's, it's the, there's no equivalent.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
There's no, there's no metaphor I can use for this

44:20.000 --> 44:22.320
because there's no like room.

44:22.320 --> 44:26.320
There's no like place that you go to, to fuck.

44:26.320 --> 44:30.000
Like that you like would see your, your,

44:30.000 --> 44:32.080
your study buddy in and then they'd be like,

44:32.080 --> 44:33.680
hey, sup, I'm here to fuck too.

44:33.680 --> 44:34.880
I see you trying to fuck.

44:35.680 --> 44:36.320
Cool.

44:36.320 --> 44:37.120
Me too.

44:37.120 --> 44:38.160
I don't want to fuck you.

44:38.160 --> 44:40.720
I just wanted to point out that we're both here to fuck,

44:40.720 --> 44:41.760
but not each other.

44:41.760 --> 44:43.520
I mean, there is a metaphor Griffin.

44:43.520 --> 44:45.520
It's like going to any club ever.

44:45.520 --> 44:47.680
It's like when people go out to try to meet someone

44:47.680 --> 44:49.920
at a bar or anything, it would be like walking up

44:49.920 --> 44:51.040
to someone, you know, and like,

44:51.040 --> 44:53.040
hey, you trying to have sex with someone tonight?

44:53.040 --> 44:53.600
Me too.

44:53.600 --> 44:54.320
What's up?

44:54.320 --> 44:56.640
Like, Hey, that's not cool.

44:56.640 --> 44:59.200
But it's like, but it would be, yes.

44:59.200 --> 45:02.240
But like to a, to the hundredth degree, it's like,

45:02.240 --> 45:03.440
but it's a fuck club.

45:03.440 --> 45:05.680
It's specifically a fuck club.

45:05.680 --> 45:08.560
It's like, I'm reading the description,

45:08.560 --> 45:10.800
the learn more section of grinder.

45:10.800 --> 45:14.320
And I have not seen the word relationship pop up once.

45:14.320 --> 45:18.000
There is no mention of finding your forever love here.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.760
It's all about here is literally what it says.

45:19.760 --> 45:21.440
It says zero feet away.

45:21.440 --> 45:22.720
Our mission for you.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.720
Grinders different because it's uncomplicated.

45:26.400 --> 45:29.840
Wink and meant to help you meet guys while you're on the go.

45:29.840 --> 45:32.800
It's not, well, it's not your average dating site.

45:32.800 --> 45:35.200
You know, the ones that make you sit in front of a far away

45:35.200 --> 45:37.760
computer, filling out complex, detailed profiles

45:37.760 --> 45:39.440
and answering invasive, psychological questions.

45:39.440 --> 45:40.720
No fucking math.

45:40.720 --> 45:43.040
Mr. Phillips knows the fucking score.

45:43.040 --> 45:44.800
I want to blast a hot young butt.

45:45.360 --> 45:47.120
That's what do you, what do you like?

45:47.120 --> 45:48.400
What kind of movies do you like?

45:48.400 --> 45:49.600
Well, made in Manhattan.

45:49.600 --> 45:52.240
Also, I want to blast a hot young power bottom

45:52.240 --> 45:53.520
and I want to really blast it.

45:53.520 --> 45:55.360
If it's one of my students, so be it.

45:56.160 --> 45:56.640
So be it.

45:56.640 --> 45:57.120
I don't know.

45:58.560 --> 46:03.760
Come what may, you know, I think it's beautiful.

46:05.680 --> 46:06.160
Me too.

46:06.160 --> 46:07.600
I think it's great.

46:07.600 --> 46:10.960
Yeah, but I wouldn't want someone putting me on blast though.

46:10.960 --> 46:12.400
That's the thing, that's the question.

46:12.400 --> 46:14.240
I think it's great if you want to use an app to

46:14.240 --> 46:15.200
find people and hook up.

46:15.200 --> 46:16.320
It's 2013, man.

46:16.320 --> 46:17.840
Be safe, be safe about it.

46:17.840 --> 46:18.320
Be safe out there.

46:18.320 --> 46:22.080
The weird thing is person A that's like messaging person B

46:22.080 --> 46:23.360
and like, hey, I saw you on there.

46:23.920 --> 46:25.200
We're both doing it.

46:25.200 --> 46:28.160
It's like, yeah, you're also putting yourself on blast.

46:28.160 --> 46:28.480
Right.

46:28.480 --> 46:29.600
It's like opening your eyes.

46:29.600 --> 46:31.760
I was also just trying to touch and go.

46:31.760 --> 46:34.800
It's also, it's like opening your eyes during prayer, basically.

46:34.800 --> 46:37.840
If you saw me, you were there too.

46:39.200 --> 46:42.960
Grindr, it's like opening your eyes during prayer.

46:42.960 --> 46:44.320
Yeah, that's-

46:44.320 --> 46:45.520
Use the coupon code, my brother.

46:45.520 --> 46:48.720
My brother, get one free blast.

46:48.720 --> 46:49.200
Just kidding.

46:49.200 --> 46:50.080
They're all free.

46:50.080 --> 46:51.280
Have fun.

46:51.280 --> 46:54.480
Have a blast from the McElroy brothers on Grindr.

46:54.480 --> 46:57.280
If you see us on there, say, hey, say sup.

46:57.280 --> 47:00.240
We don't have to fuck, but just a little acknowledgement wouldn't hurt.

47:00.800 --> 47:01.840
And don't tell our wives.

47:01.840 --> 47:03.280
Do not tell our wives.

47:03.280 --> 47:04.320
Holy shit.

47:04.320 --> 47:05.200
Holy moly.

47:06.640 --> 47:09.200
Guys, thank you so much for listening.

48:17.840 --> 48:20.320
Shit goes right off the rails.

48:20.320 --> 48:21.920
Shit gets a little tazy.

48:22.560 --> 48:26.240
I want to thank John Roderick and the Longwinters for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

48:26.240 --> 48:27.920
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

48:27.920 --> 48:30.160
Got a lot of tweets this week from people buying that album.

48:30.960 --> 48:33.120
And I can't, I just, that's such a good idea.

48:33.120 --> 48:34.160
It's such a great album.

48:35.040 --> 48:35.840
So go pick that up.

48:35.840 --> 48:39.600
You can find it at any fine music retailer, like cdnow.com.

48:41.200 --> 48:43.920
Also, apologies for the short episode.

48:43.920 --> 48:45.120
Justin's about to leave town.

48:45.120 --> 48:46.400
We're trying to get it in under the wire.

48:46.400 --> 48:48.960
Next one's probably going to be a little bit late because you're not getting back until

48:49.520 --> 48:51.360
like late, late, late next week, right?

48:51.360 --> 48:52.480
If I come back.

48:52.480 --> 48:55.440
If he comes back, if he doesn't hop in the TARDIS and just go and enjoy.

48:55.440 --> 48:58.000
And Griffin, last question.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.280
One last one.

48:59.280 --> 49:01.280
Make it count to keep you safe in Europe.

49:01.280 --> 49:04.160
This Yahoo was sent in by Krista Whalen.

49:04.160 --> 49:04.640
Thank you, Krista.

49:04.640 --> 49:07.200
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Love Lazy, who asks,

49:09.200 --> 49:11.280
is it possible to make toast in a microwave?

49:11.280 --> 49:13.840
Please, I am craving toast, pregnant, and at work.

49:15.840 --> 49:16.880
I'm Justin McElroy.

49:16.880 --> 49:17.760

49:20.000 --> 49:20.800
Kiss your dad.

49:20.800 --> 49:34.240
And my brother, my brother and me kiss your dad square on the lips.

And we're both the hosts of Stop Podcasting Yourself, which is a podcast from Canada.

49:56.880 --> 50:03.120
In fact, we won the best podcast in Canada two years in a row at the Canadian Comedy Awards.

50:03.680 --> 50:04.400
Sounds made up.

50:04.400 --> 50:05.600
It does sound made up.

50:05.600 --> 50:08.640
Even as I was saying it, I'm like, did that really happen?

50:09.440 --> 50:10.640
Here's the thing.

50:10.640 --> 50:17.040
Stop Podcasting Yourself is a very positive show about two people who hate absolutely everything.

50:17.040 --> 50:22.240
But we love you and you listening through all this promo.

50:22.240 --> 50:24.640
Ah, the people have already fast forwarded through this part of the promo.

50:24.640 --> 50:25.520
Anyway, thanks.

50:25.520 --> 50:47.520
