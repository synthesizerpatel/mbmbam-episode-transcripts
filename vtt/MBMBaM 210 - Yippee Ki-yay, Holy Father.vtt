00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.920
Hey everybody, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm your

00:47.920 --> 00:52.640
oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby

00:52.640 --> 00:59.280
bubbykins Griffin McElroy. If you've never listened to our program before, we take your

00:59.280 --> 01:05.520
problems and turn them alchemy-like into wisdom. I myself though am coming up on one of the

01:06.240 --> 01:11.920
first challenges, the first major challenges of my adult life. Things have been pretty smooth,

01:12.560 --> 01:19.120
but we're counting down to, we're about t-minus three weeks, but let's hope for like two weeks

01:19.120 --> 01:27.920
or one week and a half. Or tomorrow. Or tomorrow. So you can party again. To me like basically never

01:27.920 --> 01:35.840
doing anything again ever. Yeah, I mean I would be psyched to just have excuses just like chill

01:35.840 --> 01:39.600
all the time. That's what yeah that's what dadhood is like. It's just yeah because that's what I've

01:39.600 --> 01:46.880
heard. You have a new baby and it's just chill all the time. No, but like you do when you get like a

01:46.880 --> 01:51.200
super big dose of that before the baby comes because it's just like you don't feel like doing

01:51.200 --> 01:59.600
anything. Because of the nesting, I think. Yesterday I did take on probably what has been

01:59.600 --> 02:07.200
the most, the single most horrifying step of this entire thing. It is not, you would think that

02:07.200 --> 02:10.800
there were any number of things that would have terrified me over the past few months,

02:10.800 --> 02:17.120
and you would be correct. Right. But you took a brisk class. Yeah, I uh. Because you're doing

02:17.120 --> 02:22.320
that shit yourself. You're taking that shit in your own hands. DIY. There's no no embracing for

02:22.320 --> 02:29.520
this for this baby, but I uh I did install a child safety seat yesterday. A car seat yesterday,

02:29.520 --> 02:33.600
which I thought would be sort of a breezy way. I'm following along my parenting book,

02:33.600 --> 02:39.680
get ready for baby book, and this week's activity was to install the child safety seat. Is the title

02:39.680 --> 02:47.280
a like trying to get you psyched for the next baby book? Is it like get ready for this book?

02:47.280 --> 02:52.240
It's gonna be, it's gonna be so tight. You're not prepared for the words that we've got in this one.

02:52.240 --> 02:57.120
It's like get ready for your sick baby coming, it's coming, just dropping this year, get pumped,

02:57.120 --> 03:02.480
get psyched. So I'm putting in the child safety seat. It is the single most terrifying. Lawyers,

03:02.480 --> 03:12.320
I'm assuming it's lawyers, god I hope it's lawyers, have made the the actual like installation manual,

03:12.320 --> 03:21.280
it reads like a guide on how to dispose of uh an improvised explosive device. It is terrifying.

03:21.280 --> 03:28.160
Here is here is a literal literal section from the thing. You have to adjust the recline on the seat.

03:28.160 --> 03:35.040
Oh okay, I want the baby to be comfortable. I'm gonna have a a smooth ride and sweet lean.

03:35.040 --> 03:41.600
I'm yeah a nice just a nice chilled out ride. In the manual it literally says if the seat is

03:41.600 --> 03:48.400
leaning forward too far your baby's head weight will make breathing impossible. If it's leaning

03:48.400 --> 03:56.160
back too far then in the in case of a of a wreck then uh the the seat will not protect your child.

03:56.160 --> 04:01.280
So basically wait does it give you an indication of like the degree to which you're trying to okay

04:02.160 --> 04:10.000
there is an indicator on the side which measures the levelness of the the seat. If the indicator is

04:10.000 --> 04:16.720
all blue it's safe for zero to three months. If it's all blue with literally one sixteenth of an

04:16.720 --> 04:23.360
inch of darker blue it's safe for three to six months. Oh fuck you parents. It is literally like

04:23.360 --> 04:29.040
a scene from Die Hard. Does it does the the the seat come with like a protractor that you have to

04:29.040 --> 04:36.480
use um that's like this zone is full baby death guaranteed. Guaranteed test baby that you could

04:36.480 --> 04:42.320
like try it out on just like a just a burner baby. You know just put the baby in it see how it works

04:42.320 --> 04:46.960
the first time you're like okay see now this baby can't breathe. Glad we tried it out on this baby

04:46.960 --> 04:53.840
before we put our baby in it. Yeah yeah there there is no safety net like that. You you it actually

04:53.840 --> 04:59.440
says the instruction manual and and I had a a gentleman who wanted to sell me roofing service

05:00.160 --> 05:05.840
echoed this advice. He said you know if you take that to the police station they will tell you if

05:05.840 --> 05:11.760
you did it right or not. Is that service police provide? Apparently and I think it's just for

05:11.760 --> 05:16.800
convenience because if you can't install the seat then they put you in jail because you're too

05:16.800 --> 05:21.760
dumb to have a kid. That'd be some sick pre-crime shit like we are we are just going to go ahead

05:21.760 --> 05:27.200
and toss you in here for future murder. I don't see no dark blue strip. My comfort the only comfort

05:27.200 --> 05:36.000
I take in in this uh entire process is I've been alive for 33 years. I've seen some people okay.

05:36.000 --> 05:43.840
I've seen some people and their parents didn't manage to kill them with their child safety seat

05:43.840 --> 05:50.800
so I have to assume that like I can I can swing this because I know some people. There's no way

05:50.800 --> 05:57.520
you're going to be the worst at this. Uh okay enough of this uh diversion. Enough of this clever

05:57.520 --> 06:05.040
banter. Enough of this hilarious warm-up it's time for the main event. We've got a big show uh Eat

06:05.040 --> 06:10.160
Pray Love author Elizabeth Gilbert and also Signature of All Things uh author Elizabeth

06:10.160 --> 06:15.600
Gilbert is going to be joining us as a guestpert uh that's coming up uh in just a little while.

06:15.600 --> 06:19.200
I don't think I've ever teased anything in the show and I don't know stick with us after the

06:19.200 --> 06:24.400
commercial break. A structural issue or just like we've never had anything to tease but here you go

06:24.400 --> 06:28.800
there it's our first ever tease uh but for now let's let's take some of these questions and turn

06:28.800 --> 06:35.680
them into answers. I have a problem with speaking up. I frequently have to repeat myself and people

06:35.680 --> 06:40.400
often tell me that I talk too quietly. When I increase the volume it feels like I'm yelling or

06:40.400 --> 06:45.600
that my voice takes on an unpleasant or harsh tone. What can I do to make sure that I'm being heard

06:45.600 --> 06:49.840
without feeling as though I'm shouting in people's faces? That's from whispering in Wisconsin.

06:49.840 --> 06:55.840
I know that problem. No you don't know. No no no here's the thing surprising to most

06:56.640 --> 07:01.360
while I am very loud and verbose when like telling a story or a joke or entertaining people or

07:01.360 --> 07:07.680
ordering food at a restaurant or but here's the thing half the time I mumble out my order or half

07:07.680 --> 07:13.600
the time if I want to ask somebody a question I don't like enunciate I say really quiet and kind

07:13.600 --> 07:20.080
of humbly and it's either one of those two is I'm either super loud or like really awkward and quiet

07:20.080 --> 07:25.200
and mumbly and Teresa calls me on this all the time and it's like there is no middle ground for

07:25.200 --> 07:32.720
me. Yeah you never sound normal. Yeah no never not really. I'm surprised you have found a fair

07:32.720 --> 07:39.280
amount of success I would say in this audio only medium. I have that microphone turned down to one

07:39.280 --> 07:44.000
percent. Yeah and even now like even that when you said percent you're popping your plosives

07:44.000 --> 07:47.040
you're shouting you don't even know that you're shouting right now but the people listening like

07:47.040 --> 07:52.880
is he mad at me? This is not a fun podcast listening experience for me. Travis is basically

07:52.880 --> 07:58.320
three quarters of the way to an SNL character. Right that's correct. I mean it looks like Chris

07:58.320 --> 08:03.200
Catan. That's not fair Travis I'm sorry I said that. No I grew a whole beard. You got a whole

08:03.200 --> 08:08.720
beard going on he can't grow a beard. Yeah take that Catan. Not since the fire. Just talk a little

08:08.720 --> 08:14.080
louder you guys don't need us for these. No here's the thing no here's the thing I think there's an

08:14.640 --> 08:19.760
I can infer a problem here and I think the problem is not that they're jumping from like

08:19.760 --> 08:26.240
like quiet to loud it's that when he speaks at a normal volume or she speaks at a normal volume

08:26.240 --> 08:32.880
they feel loud which I think that that point is more of a self-confidence about either your speaking

08:32.880 --> 08:37.920
voice because you feel like it's harsh and unpleasant or you feel like you're yelling

08:37.920 --> 08:44.000
and being boisterous I think that it comes from an inherent fear of voicing your opinions and

08:44.000 --> 08:48.400
saying what you need. Let me help you out here your problem is that you're you're yelling from

08:48.400 --> 08:53.280
your your head you need it where's your power a lot of people ask me that Justin where's my power?

08:53.280 --> 08:58.960
In my vagina. Okay uh it's it's down deep in your diaphragm that's where you got to push the sound

08:58.960 --> 09:05.680
from right now you can't see it but I've got uh several leather restraints wrapped around my

09:05.680 --> 09:11.680
stomach to help me uh remember to always be pushing air out of my diaphragm I literally have no room

09:11.680 --> 09:16.400
to exhale I'm waiting until after the show to exhale. Right you gotta wait to exhale. I'm waiting

09:16.400 --> 09:21.840
to exhale. Right oh they're also there for sex stuff. There are sex stuff related adjacent they're

09:21.840 --> 09:27.600
sex adjacent I would say yeah sex adjacent. It's amazing those two things don't have to be mutually

09:27.600 --> 09:32.800
exclusive it can both be good for your support and for your sex stuff. This helps me talk good

09:32.800 --> 09:41.120
in public and also the chafing does things vis-a-vis boners. You know sex stuff. That is a good

09:41.120 --> 09:45.840
point though because you learn in theater the ability to like support and not yell like you

09:45.840 --> 09:51.120
can project and you can be confident without like yelling to the back of the theater so I think

09:51.120 --> 09:56.480
that's it just support yourself with air feel confident what you say. Let me uh let me let me

09:56.480 --> 10:02.640
perform a quick demonstration. Terrific I can't wait for this. This is me speaking with my normal

10:02.640 --> 10:10.080
voice you can hear uh all of this sound is coming from my mouth and my neck.

10:10.080 --> 10:18.080
The shit in your neck meat that makes the sound waves. My neck meat is filtering the sound waves

10:18.080 --> 10:25.280
out through what scientists call the the shout hole. Your your moist your moist cords are slapping

10:25.280 --> 10:30.640
together like two fishes thrown together at a fish market. So this is just my normal

10:30.640 --> 10:40.080
this is all with without any other support. Yeah and now I'm talking with my diaphragm you can hear

10:40.080 --> 10:45.200
clear difference. Oh Justin I'm in the back of the theater I'm in the back of the theater and

10:45.200 --> 10:51.920
I'm hearing every word of that. Why does your diaphragm have an accent? It's just from the sound

10:51.920 --> 11:02.800
being pushed out. I disagree. Oh that's painful. Yeah it hurts to act. It hurts to act that's why

11:02.800 --> 11:09.040
they pay them so much. It's not easy. That's why Liza Minnelli got out of the game for so long.

11:09.040 --> 11:12.320
You actually sounded exactly like Liza Minnelli right there so I think there might be a little

11:12.320 --> 11:17.280
bit of truth to what you're saying. She had to have her mouth hole completely redone. Yeah

11:17.280 --> 11:22.080
completely burned it out. Uh y'all want a yahoo? Hit me. How about this yahoo it's in by our good

11:22.080 --> 11:28.400
buddy Drew Davenport. Um he has a lot more um honorary titles but trying to keep this show

11:28.400 --> 11:34.640
you know popping you know fast. Thank you Drew Davenport. It's by yahoo answers user George

11:34.640 --> 11:44.640
or Jorge who asks I mean I don't know uh who asks my 14 year old son wants to be naked for Halloween?

11:44.640 --> 11:49.120
In July we usually buy our Halloween costumes because the Halloween shop that we go to stays

11:49.120 --> 11:55.200
open until July. That's the smartest fucking thing I've ever heard on yahoo answers. Then

11:55.200 --> 11:59.760
everything is 75% off. I mean they didn't come up with it. They didn't come up with this Halloween

11:59.760 --> 12:07.120
costumes racket. Fair. Um I know crazy right? That wasn't me that was yahoo. Uh I have three

12:07.120 --> 12:11.760
children one three-year-old one six-year-old and one 14-year-old all boys. I got this cute bumblebee

12:11.760 --> 12:15.680
costume for my three-year-old and my six-year-old wanted to dress up as Darth Vader. Funny how he

12:15.680 --> 12:20.960
still loves Star Wars though. But my 14-year-old says he just wants to go trick-or-treating naked

12:21.920 --> 12:26.160
and when I asked him again if he wanted a costume he said he wanted to go completely naked and that

12:26.160 --> 12:32.160
it would save us money anyway. I am the very nice kind of dad and I don't like to be stern or mean

12:32.160 --> 12:41.760
but I don't know but is it okay for my 14-year-old son to trick-or-treat naked? Love George. Uh huh. I'm

12:41.760 --> 12:45.760
just kind of an amateur dad right now but I can go ahead and tell you that isn't that that's not

12:45.760 --> 12:51.040
what nice daddies do. Yeah. That nice daddies don't let their kids run around. Now if you're a cool

12:51.040 --> 12:58.080
dad you let your kid run around with his dong out and stuff. And check out my kids kibblets. Hey I'm

12:58.080 --> 13:04.480
one of those cool dads. Hey dad my penis is in like a really crazy transformational 14-year-old

13:04.480 --> 13:09.280
phase right now. It's covered it's pupating it's the worst but I do want to get that out and just

13:09.280 --> 13:14.720
sort of show the neighborhood. Um can I do that? No you can't do that. Why are you so stern and mean

13:14.720 --> 13:20.480
dad? Oh shit I just figured this question out. Finally. This 14-year-old doesn't want to go

13:20.480 --> 13:25.920
trick-or-treating anymore. Oh so they're calling their bluff. Yeah he thinks he's too old to go out

13:25.920 --> 13:30.800
trick-or-treating. So he's like yeah I'll go dad if you let me go naked. But this is a dangerous

13:30.800 --> 13:38.160
this dongman's gambit is a fucking dangerous game. Yeah it's a dongerous game. If George or Jorge

13:38.160 --> 13:46.560
calls your bluff that's it. Yeah. You're done in that town professionally. Have we considered that

13:46.560 --> 13:53.360
maybe naked is the name of a new street drug? Dad I'm not gonna trick-or-treat I want to go on naked.

13:53.360 --> 13:57.360
And he gets all tripped out all hopped up on goofballs and then he's running around the

13:57.360 --> 14:02.720
neighborhood all cranked on naked. And kids are like shouting at him because they recognize it

14:02.720 --> 14:06.240
because they're in middle school too they know the they know the score they're shouting at him

14:06.240 --> 14:14.480
like he's on the Jorge Jr's on that nude. Jorge's wanged on that nude. And ironically one of the

14:14.480 --> 14:18.800
clearest signs that someone is on naked is they can't stand the feel of clothes on their body.

14:18.800 --> 14:23.920
Do you think maybe he just wants to like slim good body it? Oh maybe like a see-through suit so you

14:23.920 --> 14:29.040
can see his insides that might be a good compromise. I want to go as now you will have to put like a

14:29.040 --> 14:33.200
full dong on the suit. Yeah slim good body I don't remember let me hold on let me do a quick

14:33.200 --> 14:40.000
google image search yeah no dick here no dicks on slim good body uh uh oh no that's like guts and

14:40.000 --> 14:49.440
stuff yeah yeah he went clearly he went full like visible man yeah but you can't see like his uh

14:49.440 --> 14:57.200
testes he can't see his like testes or his um was good buddies what i've seen it's good buddies

14:58.400 --> 15:04.240
can we get back to the real question here absolutely which is what fucking 14 year old

15:04.240 --> 15:10.800
in existence has ever been like people have got to check out what i have going downtown people

15:10.800 --> 15:15.920
have to see what i'm working with in my downtown my 14 year old downtown confident 14 year old oh

15:15.920 --> 15:21.680
yeah or uh like a chimera because it doesn't fucking exist he's like a dragon he's the quits

15:21.680 --> 15:26.560
that's heterak he's the one who's not afraid of his 14 year old dong he got his dick figured out

15:26.560 --> 15:34.080
at 10 is what you're saying okay what it what if this is uh a sort of research project for him he

15:34.080 --> 15:40.560
so doesn't have his dong figured out that he needs to stroll around town with it exposed to judge

15:40.560 --> 15:47.280
from reactions as to whether or not he has suitable or possibly deformed equipment he has no

15:47.840 --> 15:54.960
there's no uh uh uh uh uh comparisons for him so in order to judge the quality of his 14 year old

15:54.960 --> 16:00.400
in order to judge the quality of his dong he's just gonna look at people's faces and see see

16:00.400 --> 16:05.360
what their reactions to it are have you guys checked out that documentary on netflix about

16:05.360 --> 16:10.800
the 14 year old kid who just wants to see what people think of his dong zero dreams of sushi

16:11.360 --> 16:16.800
boyhood boy that's what that's what the film boyhood is and it's great because you get to

16:16.800 --> 16:23.200
watch you get to watch that pupation in process over 11 years in high definition go see it at

16:23.200 --> 16:28.560
nymax you won't regret it it's a little bit the 10 year old boy forms a cocoon around himself

16:28.560 --> 16:34.640
yeah at 14 bursts out fully formed dong and all yeah then walks around the neighborhood and gets

16:34.640 --> 16:39.440
some kit kats yeah if you've uh not listened to our show before that's the portion where we talk

16:39.440 --> 16:45.200
about teenage dong and now here's the next question is there a way i could ask my husband to

16:45.200 --> 16:51.200
lose a little weight he has always carried a little weight but in the last year it's getting

16:51.200 --> 17:02.080
blueberry blubbery around he's eating some magic bubble gum he doesn't listen to this podcast i'm

17:02.080 --> 17:06.400
an active person and i'm pretty disciplined about portion size and eating healthy is there a way i

17:06.400 --> 17:11.520
can ask him to trim down without absolutely hurting his feelings and that's from uh sydney

17:11.520 --> 17:19.040
mcelroy in huntington west virginia wow usually they don't include the whole name that's weird

17:19.040 --> 17:26.560
because i'm married to a wait a minute um i mean let's be realistic that's from every every person

17:26.560 --> 17:34.640
currently married to a mcelroy man well travis eats 20 cookies a day how do i get him just to

17:34.640 --> 17:42.240
cut back to 10 10 cookies a day just reasonable i mean i guess i mean this one's hitting a little

17:42.240 --> 17:47.520
close to home guys it's hard to make goose and it's like how would i want someone to tell me i'm

17:47.520 --> 17:56.320
chubbing up right is this is this what it's like to be on like the receiving end of our of our goof

17:56.320 --> 18:02.880
maelstrom i don't like this at all the goosters have become the goof i don't like this one bit

18:02.880 --> 18:08.400
you could you don't have to talk to him about losing weight you could just start altering the

18:08.400 --> 18:16.160
life that the two of you share so when you're gonna go out on a walk then um invite him to go

18:16.160 --> 18:20.160
along there and tell him maybe you're gonna go for ice cream and then wander around the neighborhood

18:20.160 --> 18:24.160
and say huh i guess they lost the ice cream store well i guess we should go home now who lost for

18:24.160 --> 18:29.200
that who lost five six seven times who lost the ice cream store in this situation that both of

18:29.200 --> 18:34.240
them they're like i i thought i thought there was a new one around here uh never mind let's go home

18:34.240 --> 18:39.520
and he'll fall for that if it was me seven eight nine ten times so there there's a week and a half

18:39.520 --> 18:45.280
of of exercise now as far as portion control goes that's very easy uh when the two of you are making

18:45.280 --> 18:50.640
dinner or you're ordering order exactly enough for two small portions that's all you can make

18:51.200 --> 18:56.800
and then if he eats too much more then you just take like a little sliver just like oh i guess

18:56.800 --> 19:03.040
there's only this much left for me how about this play you're at applebee's because where else are

19:03.040 --> 19:09.200
you gonna go see you tomorrow applebee's you got applebee's that is their slogan i know this you

19:09.200 --> 19:14.560
got applebee's and both of you get a delicious like shitty steak with like a bunch of cheese

19:14.560 --> 19:20.240
melted on top of it and then um you both get that but you hate yourself it's good but it's

19:20.240 --> 19:26.560
fucking sucks and then you take yours and accidentally throw it on the ground and then

19:26.560 --> 19:32.480
you say i know i made a whoopsie again and then he says don't worry we'll go half seas on mine and

19:32.480 --> 19:38.400
then you do that every time that you eat anything anywhere ever again and he's gonna get curious

19:38.400 --> 19:46.080
after a while like god damn it sheila god damn it sheila god damn it sheila you promised sheila i

19:46.080 --> 19:50.080
warn you if i have one more time i was gonna insist you got an mri i think there's something

19:50.080 --> 19:57.600
seriously wrong in there up in your brain goo um so that could work that could work maybe that's

19:57.600 --> 20:04.400
how it's just drop shit by saying like uh we need to eat better we need to exercise bad shit that

20:04.400 --> 20:10.880
dog don't that dog don't hunt though like i won't fly that's like very direct yeah well if we want

20:10.880 --> 20:15.520
to go indirect could you gaslight him and while he's at work switch out his clothes all of them

20:15.520 --> 20:21.200
for like half a size smaller each day that's some if that happened to me all i would think is man

20:21.200 --> 20:31.040
my muscles are getting huge yeah um i didn't exercise yeah um no travis that's some psycho

20:31.040 --> 20:39.200
pageant mom shit don't i would somewhere between completely direct and psycho pageant mom could you

20:39.200 --> 20:47.120
put him on the pageant circuit and assume that the uh disapproving looks from the other moms

20:47.120 --> 20:52.640
will sort of like edge him towards uh wanting better fitness do you assume those disapproving

20:52.640 --> 20:58.640
moms uh they're looking at him that way because he's a little chubby or because he's a 35 year

20:58.640 --> 21:05.600
old six-year-old look at him on that stage god he could afford to lose 15 or 20 pounds he would be

21:05.600 --> 21:13.120
so much healthier what is he doing get lose 15 pounds and get a flipper dave get a dave look at

21:13.120 --> 21:21.520
your kids baton routine was weak his baton routine was terrible and also he is an old man

21:21.520 --> 21:29.840
and everyone else here isn't here is the way you can encourage any man to sleep in that princess

21:29.840 --> 21:36.160
bed here is the way you can encourage any man to become physically fit i just solved this problem

21:36.160 --> 21:45.360
for all of the world you ready ready for this i guess buy him two items one a 10-foot wall

21:45.360 --> 21:54.000
two a sweet grappling hook i guarantee he will be in your yard and do everything in his power

21:54.000 --> 22:00.720
until he is able to climb the rope attached to the grappling hook like a sweet sweet ninja

22:00.720 --> 22:06.720
he will do whatever fitness things he needs to do he will work on it every night he will not stop

22:06.720 --> 22:13.120
until he can scale it and feel like an awesome wall scaling guy now justin i feel like that's

22:13.120 --> 22:18.960
awesome advice not the most actionable we've ever given because i don't know where one buys a 10-foot

22:18.960 --> 22:23.280
high wall you gotta build it gotta build it if he's if he's gonna learn to get fit you gotta

22:23.280 --> 22:27.760
learn a little carpentry and masonry okay yep get some rocks get some slack get some glue

22:28.320 --> 22:33.360
that wall is gonna fall and kill your husband uh-huh and then he'll be much thinner he will be

22:33.360 --> 22:39.200
a new skinny husband you just got a flat family your husband he'll lose an entire dimension

26:34.800 --> 26:40.880
phonetically pronounce dg majdi majdi yeah it's just like reading like the letters come come

26:40.880 --> 26:49.040

news but i can't because i'm scared there's no off ramp for catfishing no just have to take it

28:23.920 --> 28:29.120

she joins us for reasons that defy understanding here on my brother my brother and me elizabeth

30:26.000 --> 30:29.760
gilbert welcome to our program thank you so much thank you for saying the signature of all things

30:29.760 --> 30:37.120
before eat pray love that is not a typical way to introduce me well there you go i'm into i'm into

30:37.120 --> 30:43.280
the new stuff i like it you like you like my acoustic album right exactly whatever the opposite

30:43.280 --> 30:49.120
of the deep deep cut is right if it's new or it's i guess it's it is a a shallow it is a

30:50.080 --> 30:56.240
superficial cut no that sounds terrible that sounds extremely offensive it's nice to be on

30:56.240 --> 31:02.800
the show griffin yeah thank you for your superficial cut i'm just kidding uh so we're

31:02.800 --> 31:07.680
gonna ask you some questions that have been submitted by our readers and you have to help

31:07.680 --> 31:12.800
them at least as much as we usually do so okay but i've been listening to the show for years

31:12.800 --> 31:21.760
and i know that that sets the bar very high yeah oh uh so here we go okay let's go i am a low now

31:21.760 --> 31:26.000
miss gilbert you you of course already know that at this point uh i am in the character of the question

31:26.000 --> 31:33.280
asker do not be confused this is not just gilbert i'm gonna get really intimidated so all right

31:33.280 --> 31:42.240
yeah it's mrs gilbert so you can call me professor gilbert it's dr gilbert honorary

31:42.240 --> 31:49.280
didn't go to nine years of gilbert school to be called the miss okay so uh again so again

31:49.280 --> 31:53.920
in in the character of the question asker yes i'm a lowly bookstore employee here in sunny

31:53.920 --> 31:59.680
north vancouver canada and now i'm in west virginia so not this isn't me this is the

31:59.680 --> 32:04.720
question oh my god i got so confused thank you for clarifying that north vancouver canada what

32:04.720 --> 32:09.040
i want to know is how should i be selling your books do you have a favorite should i stick to

32:09.040 --> 32:12.640
the classic you pray love or the signature of all things your new baby that's from brendan

32:12.640 --> 32:17.520
oh my gosh how do you want to be marketed that's so nice um i'm going to send him a whole marketing

32:17.520 --> 32:23.200
plan for how he should be selling my books um i think he should play the hits personally

32:23.200 --> 32:29.200
because i think um that people probably want to just keep reading eat pray love because that's

32:29.200 --> 32:33.680
certainly what it looks like and um if he likes the signature of all things and he's read it and

32:33.680 --> 32:39.440
he wants to hand sell it for that purpose that's great but i don't know i i don't feel like anybody's

32:39.440 --> 32:45.280
obliged to um i don't feel like anybody's obliged to come with me on all the creative journeys that

32:45.280 --> 32:50.400
i go on just because i like going on them so i'm never offended when people just kind of stick to

32:50.400 --> 32:54.880
eat pray love does that make sense but what you're saying is them royalties all spend the same yeah

32:56.400 --> 33:01.520
coaching either way there have got to be book hipsters though right like oh you're buying

33:01.520 --> 33:06.080
eat pray love well i guess that's all right i mean i like her b sides but that's fine

33:07.120 --> 33:11.280
b sides now from superficial to b sides you you two are killing me

33:11.280 --> 33:17.360
um but you know what i will pull out of that that question that i think is interesting and

33:17.360 --> 33:21.840
that we could talk about is the idea of he said signature of all things is your new baby

33:22.560 --> 33:26.960
and and that's something that i always try to talk people out of doing about their own work

33:26.960 --> 33:32.560
is calling it their baby because i think that sets you up for terrible trauma um but i think

33:32.560 --> 33:36.000
the feeling they're trying to get across and i think it's something that like in the music scene

33:36.000 --> 33:41.840
especially like i will get psyched to go see like a musical artist that i have loved my entire life

33:41.840 --> 33:46.000
right and then i go to their concert and they're like here's only songs off our new

33:46.000 --> 33:53.520
album you don't you don't know any of these songs so don't try and sing along i hate i heard um john

33:53.520 --> 33:58.160
cougar melon camp in an interview once and he said people who work really hard and have hard lives

33:58.160 --> 34:05.840
didn't spend 50 bucks to come and hear me not sing jack and diane i love that and i feel like that

34:05.840 --> 34:10.640
that's why sometimes very considerate interviewers will say i don't want to bother you with questions

34:10.640 --> 34:15.840
about he pray love and i'm like it's my jack and diane yeah people didn't come to this bookstore

34:15.840 --> 34:21.040
to hear me not say you know answer the question what's what was it like to see julia roberts

34:21.040 --> 34:26.560
play you and like i'll answer that question 20 000 times because it's rude not to i think um so

34:26.560 --> 34:34.320
so yeah jimmy buffett had a great quote you know uh james buffett uh song songster and they asked

34:34.320 --> 34:38.800
him about margaritaville and he said am i gonna sing it to my daughter tonight as she goes to

34:38.800 --> 34:45.360
sleep no am i gonna sing at the concert tomorrow yes well it's also got to be a little bit of like

34:45.360 --> 34:50.880
what gets them in the door right like if they read whatever book and then go now i want to read more

34:50.880 --> 34:54.320
or the same with like the musical artist maybe you hear jack and diane and then you go i want

34:54.320 --> 34:58.800
to find out more about this john cougar melon can fellow who is this who's this young upstart

35:03.280 --> 35:08.880
he's a comer that one um my parents went and saw gordon lightfoot once at the beginning of

35:08.880 --> 35:12.960
the concert he announced that he would not be singing the wreck of the edmund fist gerald

35:12.960 --> 35:20.000
and they said like literally 20 of the audience that's so great is that what is that some sort

35:20.000 --> 35:26.000
of a love test on his count to see um then he did sing it like okay now i was just fucking with those

35:26.000 --> 35:30.560
guys i am gonna sing the wreck because you're the only ones who deserve it because you're the true

35:30.560 --> 35:36.320
you're the true love you're the true light feet i'm gonna sing i'm gonna sing an abridged 14

35:36.320 --> 35:42.800
minute version i saw i saw rufus wainwright once after uh playing after ben folds and it was an

35:42.800 --> 35:48.640
outdoor show and like after ben folds finished uh uh i would say like a good third of the audience

35:48.640 --> 35:53.840
stood up and walked out as rufus wainwright was coming on stage and the first thing he said was

35:53.840 --> 36:01.280
well now that all the straight people are gone awesome i have a backed up sink that i can't get

36:01.280 --> 36:06.880
running smoothly what the hell elizabeth gilbert i've tried draino product with no luck any help

36:06.880 --> 36:11.840
would be greatly appreciated that's from backed up in the bay i love our listeners what we had

36:11.840 --> 36:19.120
john roderick um rock musician rock legend the cougar melon camp of our time on the show and

36:19.120 --> 36:26.080
somebody asked him about eating boneless chicken wings i don't think why squander the are you a sink

36:26.080 --> 36:34.080
expert i i don't want to brag but i can totally answer this question and i'm glad that backed up

36:34.080 --> 36:39.920
thought to send it to me um first of all stop washing your goat in your sink there you go yeah

36:39.920 --> 36:45.440
that's number one that's the biggest problem are they a shedding are they a shedding animal um goats

36:45.440 --> 36:50.240
are pretty you know they can be pretty shitty depending upon the breed um but i think that's

36:50.240 --> 36:54.960
the problem that i i mean just i'm just doing this over the phone i haven't seen the sink but

36:54.960 --> 37:00.800
i'm guessing yeah i'm going to go it's a very it's a very card talk like experience what sound

37:00.800 --> 37:06.000
is your sink making is it like a roar roar roar what sound is your goat making there's a lot of

37:06.000 --> 37:11.040
variables there's a lot of variables there also i would say move that's what i do that's what i do

37:11.920 --> 37:17.920
when anything breaks it's like the blue it's like the blue bristles on your toothbrush

37:17.920 --> 37:21.760
when your sink stops working it's time to get a new house yes the house is the house is done

37:21.760 --> 37:28.000
you're moving today right you told us before we started is it a sink related issue no i had a

37:28.000 --> 37:34.960
light bulb go out on the porch and i don't have a ladder that's tall enough to fix it so we're

37:34.960 --> 37:40.160
moving you do have a car with a lot of trunk space that's right and you do have some cardboard boxes

37:40.160 --> 37:44.240
and every time i look at that burned out light bulb now i'm like not my problem anymore

37:44.240 --> 37:49.280
yeah next sorry sucker good luck next owner i didn't put that in my homeowner's report

37:49.280 --> 37:56.960
yeah you have to disclose that during the closing um uh i i removed a pretty horrific uh clog from

37:56.960 --> 38:02.240
a drain a few months ago and man there is nothing that will disabuse you of whatever romanticism

38:02.240 --> 38:08.080
you have attached to humanity quicker than doing that and thinking this came from me did it look

38:08.080 --> 38:14.560
like you've pulled a rat a rat out of the like just a dead it's so disgusting it's the worst

38:14.560 --> 38:22.000
oh it's brutal it's like a wax covered rat i've done this before it's nasty a rat in wax

38:24.160 --> 38:27.600
i made a candle out of it a decorative it seems so cruel elizabeth

38:27.600 --> 38:31.840
when i get interested in some creative pursuit i tend to go hard on consuming the behind the scenes

38:31.840 --> 38:35.840
media slash content for it i'll start listening to a bunch of podcasts follow various relevant

38:35.840 --> 38:40.320
public figures reading blogs etc i started wondering if steeping myself in all this

38:40.320 --> 38:46.400
peripheral content is prematurely satisfying the desire to actually go and do did you guys as

38:46.400 --> 38:50.880
gilbert and brothers alike experience anything like this before you started acting actively

38:50.880 --> 38:55.440
creating is the trade-off of insight versus potential stalling worth it am i completely

38:55.440 --> 39:00.080
imagining this problem that's from interested but inactive um i mean it sounds like what you're

39:00.080 --> 39:06.640
talking about is is research if you have like a even like a potential desire to to dip in then

39:06.640 --> 39:11.920
everything you're doing is research the trouble is that you can like consume so much high quality

39:11.920 --> 39:15.760
content that it can scare you out of like i'll never be able to make something like this and

39:15.760 --> 39:20.320
then you don't do it i also find because i do this a lot sometimes you can trick yourself into

39:20.320 --> 39:27.760
feeling like research is doing the thing and never actually make progress on the actual project

39:27.760 --> 39:32.560
because you feel like you're already accomplishing something because i get i do that all the time

39:32.560 --> 39:36.240
where it's like oh i want to learn about this so i can do it and then i learn about it and feel

39:36.240 --> 39:42.480
accomplished and never actually do the thing yeah do you guys feel like you know the difference if

39:42.480 --> 39:46.880
you're being very honest with yourself you know the difference between doing productive research

39:46.880 --> 39:52.320
and just dicking around like if if you were to like the the question the questioner if he were

39:52.320 --> 39:58.640
to really ask himself as he's listening to a podcast come on man like you know right like

39:58.640 --> 40:04.880
don't you know well for for for this what we're like i tend i think a lot of people have the

40:04.880 --> 40:11.200
wrong idea about creativity i think creativity is just your brain reorganizing junk and making and

40:11.200 --> 40:17.120
turning it into something different and like i i never know what junk i'm gonna put in my head that

40:17.120 --> 40:24.000
is gonna be worth pulling while we're recording this program like it what normally whatever bizarre

40:24.000 --> 40:28.800
topic that we get off on a given week is just whatever one of us has been like thinking or

40:28.800 --> 40:34.240
reading about be it jimmy buffett or sure jimmy buffett i guess like if i'm researching like live

40:34.240 --> 40:39.600
show venues for us to do live shows in and then i click over to facebook and i see somebody putting

40:39.600 --> 40:45.520
over to facebook and i see somebody posted like a buzzfeed quiz of which oc character are you

40:45.520 --> 40:51.120
and then i take the quiz trying as hard as i can to get sandy cohen using every fiber of

40:51.120 --> 40:55.040
my being to try and get sandy cohen is that research for the show guess what it fucking

40:55.040 --> 40:59.680
is because i just talked about it on the show which means you can also write it off on your

40:59.680 --> 41:05.280
taxes i just wrote that buzzfeed quiz off on my taxes that's right can i tell you guys something

41:05.280 --> 41:11.360
i got jimmy cooper what the fuck right like it's like the worst one you could have gotten yeah

41:12.400 --> 41:18.000
yeah i think did you do it again i did do it again i think the trick is that you have to

41:18.000 --> 41:22.240
remember that creativity has to go with productivity and that while you're doing this

41:22.240 --> 41:28.000
research say like you're gonna do an hour two hours of research and then you're gonna write

41:28.000 --> 41:34.560
you know a page you're going to write 500 words and just put something down or do something so

41:34.560 --> 41:39.440
like if you're going to reward yourself by watching a movie about the thing that's really

41:39.440 --> 41:43.920
interesting you you have to also do the work associated with it and eventually you'll do

41:43.920 --> 41:49.280
more work than research how when did obviously you did a lot of research for signature of all

41:49.280 --> 41:57.360
things it seems very thoroughly researched when did you know you had like done enough or was it

41:57.360 --> 42:03.280
like an ongoing process as you were writing i did like three years of research so i know

42:03.280 --> 42:09.920
this feeling in a way i know this question about preparing um but it wasn't passive it's i mean

42:09.920 --> 42:14.480
part of it is that you're not just sitting there watching movies or you know i was taking notes the

42:14.480 --> 42:19.680
entire time and and filling up shoe boxes with index cards and putting them in order of character

42:19.680 --> 42:24.160
and subject and so so you're it's sort of like what travis was saying you're making something out

42:24.160 --> 42:29.520
of what you're doing you're not just you know you're not just randomly surfing um but the but

42:29.520 --> 42:35.040
i think i knew that i was ready when i kept circling around and finding myself like uh i

42:35.040 --> 42:39.600
would i would open up a book about 19th century botanical exploration and i would feel like i

42:39.600 --> 42:43.360
knew most of it already you know like oh i know all right right right i know this i know this

42:43.360 --> 42:47.600
i know this so when you start meeting yourself you know like your tail and your head connect

42:47.600 --> 42:52.320
then i think then it's time to put the research away and and to get going on actually doing

42:52.320 --> 42:57.680
something is that scary is that because like i think we were pretty intimidated when we we all

42:57.680 --> 43:02.880
listened to like a shit ton of podcasts and and that was i guess the preparation we did before we

43:02.880 --> 43:06.640
just started doing the show and we did it like we did the first episode on a whim it was like

43:06.640 --> 43:10.880
hey we're not doing anything today let's just pull the trigger on this but it was like really

43:10.880 --> 43:17.280
intimidating i remember doing that and um that was like fucking clown shoes compared to writing a

43:17.280 --> 43:23.920
novel um so like how like isn't it intimidating to be like oh shit like the the safety net's gone

43:23.920 --> 43:28.240
i'm not like i can't just write this off as preparation anymore now i'm actually doing the

43:28.240 --> 43:34.880
thing right i just jumped off the the the cliff i think um if i can be really serious i feel like

43:35.680 --> 43:39.440
what you have to understand always about anything creative and inventive is that

43:40.000 --> 43:46.640
creativity and fear are conjoined twins and i think lots of times the reasons that people hold

43:46.640 --> 43:51.040
back from being creative is because the fear is so great and so in order to try to murder

43:51.040 --> 43:56.400
or the fear they end up killing off the creativity as well and um and so you have to just accept that

43:56.400 --> 44:01.280
they that they were born together they share all the same organs they're always going to be together

44:01.280 --> 44:06.480
and and you have to make a lot of space for just allowing the fear to coexist along with the

44:06.480 --> 44:11.040
creativity so what i always do before i begin any project is i actually sit down and have a

44:11.040 --> 44:15.840
conversation with the fear and just say um look we're going on a road trip me and creativity and

44:15.840 --> 44:21.280
i know you're coming and um i just want you to know that you're paying for gas you're gonna eat

44:21.280 --> 44:26.800
all the combos you're the worst get to touch the fucking radio you don't get to drive you don't get

44:26.800 --> 44:31.440
to hold the map you don't get to make any decisions but you get to be in the minivan and i know that

44:31.440 --> 44:36.800
you're gonna do the thing that you do which is to just sit in the back seat and scream at the top

44:36.800 --> 44:41.520
of your lungs at every corner all the horrible things that could go wrong and thank you because

44:41.520 --> 44:47.040
i know that's your contribution um but but we're but we're not creativity and i are gonna make all

44:47.040 --> 44:52.000
the choices and you don't get to make any of them but you but you have to let it be there um because

44:52.000 --> 44:56.880
it's not i feel like the harder you try to fight it the more it fights back and um and the worse

44:56.880 --> 45:01.200
it gets so you just have to make a lot of you just have to get a really big minivan um so that

45:01.200 --> 45:08.000
there's room for all three of you as you have a do you have any uh like writing ceremony do you

45:08.000 --> 45:12.960
have to be in a certain place or listen to certain music or light a certain motif or or anything along

45:12.960 --> 45:17.920
those lines i do like a certain fight club or do i recite your favorite scene from fight club yeah

45:17.920 --> 45:22.880
mostly it's reciting my favorite scenes how did you guys know that um knew it we've read your

45:22.880 --> 45:29.360
fan fiction you know you know how it is um you know a lot of it is just about you know i feel

45:29.360 --> 45:36.640
like a lot of it is just about signaling to the weird mysterious forces of creativity that you

45:36.640 --> 45:41.840
are actually taking this seriously and and i think that that like it's sort of a signal that

45:41.840 --> 45:46.160
you send to yourself and it's a signal that you send to you know the universe for lack of a better

45:46.160 --> 45:51.760
term that you're not kidding you know um and and by and there's all sorts of ways you can signal

45:51.760 --> 45:57.040
that like one of the ways i do it is that i don't write in my pajamas you know like i get dressed

45:57.040 --> 46:02.640
um oh shit you know like i know i just i just are you literally all in your pajamas right

46:02.640 --> 46:08.400
oh super definitely yes and by right now i mean like i work from home so basically around the

46:08.400 --> 46:13.200
clock 4 30 i'm like oh shit my wife's coming home i better clean my body i used to do that

46:13.200 --> 46:18.320
but i feel like it i feel like it sends a message that you're not really awake and that you're not

46:18.320 --> 46:22.800
really so like i get dressed especially at the beginning of a project like i'll get dressed like

46:22.800 --> 46:27.600
i'm going to something important you know like i'll clean the room like it's like a visitor is

46:27.600 --> 46:32.080
coming you know like i'll i'll just try to set the scene and then as the project goes on and i

46:32.080 --> 46:36.560
get more confident i'll get sloppier but i think at the beginning the ritual is like this is important

46:36.560 --> 46:41.520
and i'm i'm showing up as if it is does that make sense yeah totally i got another question for you

46:41.520 --> 46:46.160
a year and a half ago my sister began traveling around south america she saved up her money sold

46:46.160 --> 46:51.280
her house and car and quit her corporate job i'm so proud of her and her journey but i'm also a

46:51.280 --> 46:55.760
little uneasy i can't really relate to her desires her experiences i also worry about her safety at

46:55.760 --> 47:01.040
times how can i be supportive even if i feel a little left behind that's from helpless at home

47:01.040 --> 47:08.560
base oh i bet it's younger sister did it did it say younger sister uh no just sister oh it seems

47:08.560 --> 47:14.560
like a younger sister thing to do and an older sister thing to worry maybe they're twins conjoined

47:16.240 --> 47:21.360
no that would be different i worry about this because travis is moving to la i i have these

47:21.360 --> 47:26.720
worries the south america of america south america america south america la west america

47:26.720 --> 47:32.880
the left goes um i don't have an answer so if you got one for me hook me up um well first of all i

47:32.880 --> 47:37.920
think it's that the idea that somebody might not want to go on a journey like that is reminds me

47:37.920 --> 47:41.680
of a friend of mine who said to me right when i was about to leave to go on the trip that became

47:41.680 --> 47:45.840
me pray love and i said i'm doing i'm going to italy for four months and then i'm going to india

47:45.840 --> 47:49.120
and i'm going to go to this ashram and i'm going to learn how to meditate and then i'm going to

47:49.120 --> 47:56.320
indonesia and he said oh man there's a part of me that so wishes that i wanted to do that and i

47:56.320 --> 48:03.120
really have no desire whatsoever to do any of those things um i thought that was so lovely and

48:03.120 --> 48:08.960
honest um that's crazy because the thing about that is is like the desire doesn't seem like the

48:08.960 --> 48:13.120
problem to me so much as like the logistics or something like that seems like a really complicated

48:13.120 --> 48:18.400
plan i'd love to do it i'd love to do what this sister has done but like that's a lot of commitment

48:18.400 --> 48:23.120
to like quit your job and sell your house and your car and that's a lot of work and

48:23.120 --> 48:28.720
like quit your job and sell your house and your car and that seems the scary part to me not the

48:28.720 --> 48:34.880
actual traveling part i know i think you just have to i think on behalf of the person who's

48:34.880 --> 48:43.280
afraid or or feels left behind um i think you have to be more afraid for her if she's not doing

48:43.280 --> 48:48.400
the thing that she's called to do right because then then you lose your then you really lose your

48:48.400 --> 48:54.800
um like if she stays put in misery or in in boredom or in torpor when what she really wants to be

48:54.800 --> 49:01.440
doing is traveling around south america then you don't really have the full realization of that

49:01.440 --> 49:07.120
person in your life and um i think you have to let her go become who she needs to be we've got

49:07.120 --> 49:12.960
an we got another question here uh from a real uh listener of ours they said oh what does torpor

49:12.960 --> 49:20.480
mean again that's from uh just forgot it for a second but sure i know it is that from asking for

49:20.480 --> 49:31.440
a friend asking for a friend in milwaukee wisconsin from bill justin's it no wait

49:32.960 --> 49:42.560
it's from bill microphone um i don't know what do you what are you afraid is gonna happen to

49:42.560 --> 49:48.960
travis in la justin i question my my wife has a has a metaphor she always uses she says when she

49:48.960 --> 49:54.000
was little she would uh she liked to put all of her stuffed animals on her bed at once because

49:54.000 --> 49:59.360
she felt very secure knowing that they were all there on on her bed where she could keep an eye

49:59.360 --> 50:06.080
on them and and i have similar impulses for family where i wish that i could just keep everybody in

50:06.080 --> 50:11.680
sight so i could keep an eye on them and knew what was uh what what they were doing and then i could

50:11.680 --> 50:16.960
i could protect them so i i don't know what the danger is i just know that i i have fear about

50:17.520 --> 50:23.200
uh him being that far out of my out of my reach well listen if we're being honest and open about

50:23.200 --> 50:28.240
this i will say as the person that's leaving so speaking for the sister that's traveling i think

50:28.240 --> 50:33.600
the best thing that you can do question asker is to be supportive even if you don't feel it which

50:33.600 --> 50:38.880
justin has been wonderful about this because knowing that someone is back home caring about you

50:38.880 --> 50:42.720
helps you make smarter decisions because you hear that voice in your head and you're thinking

50:43.440 --> 50:47.840
what would my sister want me to do what would my brother want what would my loved one want me to

50:47.840 --> 50:52.720
do in this situation and it helps you be more responsible about your decisions and really

50:52.720 --> 50:57.040
think through things a lot more because you're not being as impulsive because you know that

50:57.040 --> 51:02.480
there's someone back home who is supporting you but also is worried about you on the on the polar

51:02.480 --> 51:08.720
opposite end i am being like extremely unsupportive of travis to feel that person sitting in the back

51:08.720 --> 51:13.280
of the audience when you just completed your piano concert and i gotta keep i gotta keep

51:13.280 --> 51:17.760
them hungry and keep them driven i fill that role elizabeth for a lot of people for a lot

51:17.760 --> 51:25.600
of people in your life and not in my life they don't know it i went i'll see i went saw cloud

51:25.600 --> 51:30.240
atlas and i will make disparaging remarks about tom hanks's performance he's not going to get

51:30.240 --> 51:35.680
those but if he did get those he would try a little bit harder don't you think griffin do

51:35.680 --> 51:42.080
you generally just sit in the back in the back seat of life um with your with your spectacles

51:42.080 --> 51:47.760
down on your nose critically watching the uh the piano recital that is everyone's journey i guess

51:47.760 --> 51:54.960
i'll ask you elizabeth what is good enough for me griffin is griffin is the statler and waldorf of

51:54.960 --> 51:59.920
the modern world who's just hanging out in life's balcony right but like some people mine is not a

51:59.920 --> 52:05.680
punitive and it's not i don't fucking enjoy it i certainly don't enjoy it it's it is a it on my

52:05.680 --> 52:11.280
deathbed i i'm going to be you know cold and alone and then the door is going to swing open and then

52:11.280 --> 52:17.280
so many successful full friends justin travis elizabeth you tom hanks gonna run in they're

52:17.280 --> 52:27.200
gonna be like thank you griffin and i'll be like your will be that's how it goes uh here's a

52:27.200 --> 52:33.200
question my friend and former roommate came home a while back man i this is gonna be a toughie so

52:33.200 --> 52:39.520
let's just let's just all hang in there together okay i'm gripping onto the arms of my chair we're

52:39.520 --> 52:43.440
gonna get through this you're you're i i'm i'm sorry about this one in advance but you did

52:43.440 --> 52:47.440
pre-screen these and give the thumbs up to all of them so let's like fucking navigate these

52:47.440 --> 52:52.320
choppy waters together here uh my friend and former roommate came home a while back with a

52:52.320 --> 52:57.680
tattoo that said for whom on his chest when i asked him what it meant he explained it as a

52:57.680 --> 53:04.000
reference to a poem he wrote inspired by the motion picture he pray love the tattoo in question has

53:04.000 --> 53:08.160
become the focal point of a lot of teasing how long can i use this tattoo against him before it

53:08.160 --> 53:14.080
gets too mean i love and kid the kid and cherish his friendship but i also like pointing out that

53:14.080 --> 53:19.200
his tattoo is horrible that's from terrible tattoo at temple university one quick point before we

53:19.200 --> 53:24.800
move on i like how uh this this person said that the tattoo had become a focal point of a lot of

53:24.800 --> 53:31.840
teasing with a non-specific uh uh tease or and then it later then it immediately clarified the

53:31.840 --> 53:37.440
next sentence like no no no i mean me for me i'm the one doing it right it starts with teasing was

53:37.440 --> 53:43.760
done and then someone was doing the teasing but from the rest object of this teasing from whom

53:43.760 --> 53:51.280
myself i will answer that for you to whom sad friend um i like that that there's i like that

53:51.280 --> 53:57.040
he's like when i was trying to figure out what he's asking i think he's asking like how do i

53:57.040 --> 54:04.720
jam in as much ridicule as possible in in a period of time that is limited in a tasteful in a tasteful

54:04.720 --> 54:11.120
way a tasteful way before what happens like then before the kid stops talking to him i guess yeah

54:11.120 --> 54:17.440
before tears the the question is always do you try to pack in as much teasing up front or do

54:17.440 --> 54:22.640
you spread it out over several years and just do a moderate amount of teasing but you get to do it

54:22.640 --> 54:30.800
for longer you know is it quantity or quality i i i find everything about this question really

54:30.800 --> 54:37.680
wonderful especially the fact that this guy wrote a poem based on the movie he pray loves well he

54:37.680 --> 54:42.080
got a tattoo based on the poem based on the movie that's based on your book yeah that's like a lot

54:42.080 --> 54:47.200
of spin-offs that's amazing you know i think if i was this guy i'd go ahead and read that but

54:47.200 --> 54:54.080
before i got that bad boy inked on my chest yeah because then at least you can say right it's based

54:54.080 --> 55:00.880
on a book and not on the movie adaptation it's a poem based on a book sounds a lot better or

55:00.880 --> 55:08.000
inspired by rather than uh inspired by the major major motion picture i think that the person

55:08.000 --> 55:16.640
who is teasing should write a novelization of the tattoo this is my graphic novel yes i have a tattoo

55:17.680 --> 55:24.000
i have a tattoo on my neck that says danger it's based on the novelization of the movie lost in

55:24.000 --> 55:31.280
space with matthew leblanc so um but i i really do you guys understand the peculiarity of the

55:31.280 --> 55:36.000
the fact that this guy doesn't seem to be holding back the teasing at all nor does anybody else and

55:36.000 --> 55:40.320
yet there seems to be like some sense that there's a statute of limitations and i don't know what

55:40.320 --> 55:45.840
what that comes from like it comes from it comes from like it doesn't matter what the source

55:45.840 --> 55:50.080
material for this tattoo is you got for whom tattooed on your chest when you're at the beach

55:50.080 --> 55:54.720
especially for like a ripped strong good body it looks like you're saying like here's a present

55:54.720 --> 56:01.680
for you america my body right am i the only one that's getting hit like if you got like a gift

56:01.680 --> 56:06.160
tag tattooed around it like that's what it would look like like i'm a present for you

56:06.160 --> 56:10.800
that's what it sounds like to me what i love i think the question is saying when i see this

56:10.800 --> 56:16.720
tattoo or we think about this tattoo i cannot help but tease this kid about it even as i'm

56:16.720 --> 56:24.000
doing it i feel bad but i can't stop how much is too mean when do i just need to like cold turkey

56:25.120 --> 56:31.360
personally i think the meanest time the meanest time to tease someone about their tattoo is right

56:31.360 --> 56:35.520
after they get their tattoo because they're still going through a lot of things like they're still

56:35.520 --> 56:41.040
processing a lot and there's probably if there's any uh uh unsure feelings about this this thing

56:41.040 --> 56:44.880
that they've done it is probably right then i think you caught him at peak vulnerability

56:44.880 --> 56:50.720
honestly it's also not like teasing someone about their weird hat or like an ugly pair of shoes he

56:50.720 --> 56:57.040
can't go you're right and take the tattoo off see i feel like when when griffin said it feels sort

56:57.040 --> 57:02.000
of arrogant like you're welcome america right that's what i'm saying i felt like totally absent

57:02.000 --> 57:08.800
i felt that it felt sort of longing like for whom am i and and then when he needs his great love he

57:08.800 --> 57:18.000
can cross out the whom and put susan it can be like you can add a question mark to the end of

57:18.000 --> 57:24.320
for whom and then susan period exactly and then it's like done my perp you know like and you keep

57:24.320 --> 57:28.800
the whom there as a reminder of your sad lonelier self and then it becomes kind of a beautiful

57:28.800 --> 57:34.160
tattoo i think well if that doesn't work out you cross it out and you put leslie like whoever

57:34.160 --> 57:42.160
you just continue right below that scratch that and then an em dash now it's melissa

57:44.240 --> 57:49.120
and if you have a long torso you can just keep going yeah how long is this kid's torso

57:49.120 --> 57:54.560
is the question that's that see these are the essentials that we never get in uh in in these

57:54.560 --> 58:03.120
bits um i i i think that we have have uh imposed on on you for quite long enough it's been a half

58:03.120 --> 58:07.360
hour that we've just been talking to you about garbage so we're sorry about that that's kind

58:07.360 --> 58:12.000
of what we do here but thank oh my god travis has changed his skype picture to him standing with a

58:12.000 --> 58:17.200
horse how am i supposed to continue with that travis that's an amazing picture your sleeves

58:17.200 --> 58:23.680

you being here thanks you guys and now let's get back to lesser quality programming yeah i guess

59:48.720 --> 59:54.480
how about a yahoo hit me someone sent in by drew davenport thank you drew test by yahoo answers

59:54.480 --> 01:00:04.000
user ds who asks best battle ever takes place in the same area that goku fought vegeta the first

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:11.040
time so not not their final battle we're talking about the first right we're the first one the

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:18.400
premiere goku v vegeta where we're the first time goku fought fajita okay got it go ahead um

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:25.520
so this is in the religion and spirituality section so we're talking about jeremiah the the

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:33.680
prophet the weeping prophet you know him you might know him from kings um 50 foot robot jeremiah with

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:39.440
laser eyes and the mobility of 8 10 ability to fly but only for three minutes before a charge

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:44.880
up of five minutes low class shields and five rockets machine gun 200 bullets a mag one minute

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:52.880
reload time and unlimited mags versus uh-huh 75 foot alan rickman with tentacles for arms and beefy

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:59.040
legs mobility of five out of ten and mid-class shields machine gun fire from suckers and

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:04.160
tentacles reload and mag size the same as above unlimited mags and mouth laser equivalent to

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:10.720
three eye lasers added bonus that he can jump 200 feet higher than jeremiah can fly but can also

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:15.440
smash the ground with the power of three missiles but can only do it twice or his shields will break

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:21.840
jesus such a good question it's a really tough one you got jeremiah in one corner author of first and

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:27.520
second kings do you think wait is it possible that by jeremiah they mean jeremy irons no they

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:34.800
mean jeremiah creator of that joint hit lamentations because i would love to see a battle between giant

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:41.200
jeremy irons no no alan rickman i don't get the connection between jeremiah and alan rickman this

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:45.920
person needed to put this question somewhere religion and spirituality i imagine is a pretty

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:52.000
good place for like getting answers on your yahoo mysteries um so he had to get some bible shit in

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.360
there somewhere we got jeremiah do you need the stats again 50 feet jeremiah he's eight out of

01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:01.440
ten speed that's pretty fast he can fly but only for three minutes i guess to charge up for five

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:06.160
so it's not like an unlimited thing alan rickman can't fly he does have tentacle machine gun arms

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:10.080
he can't jump super high though and when he pounds the ground it has the strength of three missiles

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:14.720
can't do that more than twice so or his shields will break though can they call it one thing i

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:21.360
know about jeremiah it's that he was a bullfrog don't no come on and he was a good friend of

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:26.160
justin start talking i think that the problem can they call it can they call in uh reinforcements

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:32.880
can jeremiah call in another biblical prophet can jeremiah call in like uh matthew or mark or luke

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:38.800
and alan rickman could call it i don't know like jason isaac janine garofalo hello jason isaac

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:43.840
join me please take one of my tentacle arms dislodge it from my body and use it to defend

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:48.560
yourself so your problem with this question is that there's not enough specificity in the powers

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:55.200
that have been allotted to jeremiah the biblical prophet and alan rickman who was right i'm saying

01:02:55.200 --> 01:03:00.560
they are they still human or is this like a mecha like voltron ultraman we might be looking at an

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:10.560
ultraman scenario so robotic cyber alan rickman i think in this situation jeremiah is is ultraman

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:17.200
and i think alan rickman might be the the kaiju gotcha i'm gonna have to go alan rickman every

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:23.680
time he does he has a significant height advantage he's slower and that's i think the only thing that

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:27.680
jeremiah has going from that extra three points of speed it's gonna fucking count on the battlefield

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:33.600
he can he can jump and hit the ground with the power of three missiles that's true but jeremiah

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:38.080
has five rockets so you throw you throw alan rickman in the air you're basically like skeet

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:43.680
shooting at that point yeah and you think you think alan rickman's about to win but then jeremiah

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:48.400
finds the locket that alan rickman bought for his secretary in his coat pocket and he gets so

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:53.840
pissed off he gets fucking angry and then he turns around turns the whole battle around and jeremiah

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:59.040
brings him down and then jeremiah reaches behind between his shoulder blades and pulls the gun that

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:05.120
he had duct taped there and shoots alan rickman well he didn't do that out the window oh he did

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:11.600
do that no yeah you're right um no that was in lamentations that was in lamentations five six

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:22.080
