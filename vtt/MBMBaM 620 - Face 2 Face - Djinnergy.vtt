WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.120
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed.

00:09.120 --> 00:17.380
Travis insists he's a sexpert but if there's a degree on his wall I haven't

00:17.380 --> 00:21.880
seen it. Also this show isn't for kids which I

00:21.880 --> 00:26.640
mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for

00:26.640 --> 00:32.360
listening. What's up you cool baby?

00:56.640 --> 01:25.280
You guys hear about this? I hear I see iron mics back in the headlines.

01:25.280 --> 01:31.720
Jesus Christ. You heard about this? This is just how my mind works.

01:31.720 --> 01:40.120
Should we go? No no keep it on hit. We don't need more light. Justin does.

01:40.120 --> 01:45.560
He clearly needs this. And listen I don't want to tell the people who

01:45.560 --> 01:50.040
work here how to do their jobs but what he's doing is more important than what

01:50.040 --> 01:54.920
me and Travis are doing right now. We're a glorified audience. Can you turn the lights off

01:54.920 --> 01:59.240
of me and Travis. And if you want to mute our mics. It's just always such a joy to

01:59.240 --> 02:05.540
be back in the in the Lost Cruises funny bone. Y'all are always the best audience.

02:05.540 --> 02:24.280
So iron mics back in the headlines. I've had I've had some they they don't

02:24.280 --> 02:32.520
mention that in the safety. That's great. He he hit someone in an airplane several

02:32.520 --> 02:39.680
times. If you didn't. They don't mention.

02:44.020 --> 02:48.860
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show

02:48.860 --> 02:58.720
for the modren era. Wait a minute. I'm your oldest brother Justin

02:58.720 --> 03:03.520
McElroy and I'm guessing we have not been here before. Is that accurate?

03:04.720 --> 03:11.060
Cuz this the second time you all will see it's much deluded from this. So I'm

03:11.060 --> 03:16.000
loving this. Getting it raw. The second time it's a lot more like oh yeah it's

03:16.000 --> 03:25.160
amusing not funny but amusing. I'm your middle brother Travis McElroy and I'm

03:25.160 --> 03:29.440
your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy.

03:33.080 --> 03:41.160
If if you say so man. I am just so thrilled to be here in the Paris of the

03:41.160 --> 03:51.800
Plains as I call it the city the city of fountains soccer capital of America. We

03:51.800 --> 03:57.520
want the World Cup. Am I right? Yeah. And it's also called the center of America

03:57.520 --> 04:02.600
mainly cuz it's the center of America. I mean draw an X. We're here babe. This is

04:02.600 --> 04:09.400
the heartland right here. We're here. I call it the cool Kansas City. Am I

04:09.400 --> 04:11.640
right?

04:13.520 --> 04:20.480
Fuck the other Kansas. Fuck that other Kansas City for real. Hey there's a lot of you

04:20.480 --> 04:28.120
here. If we all teamed up we could beat bad Kansas City's ass. They'd never see it

04:28.120 --> 04:35.000
coming. This is an advice show. We took a don't be jealous but we took a bus to

04:35.000 --> 04:41.080
get here. Now Justin was it a fancy tour bus like Garth Brooks might have? Um no.

04:41.080 --> 04:47.600
It was just a regular bus with cupholders. Just like with some cupholders. There

04:47.600 --> 04:55.080
was a there was a turlet in the back. No no TP which I see you. Thank you. I get it.

04:55.080 --> 05:01.840
No TP no sink. So it's really just a wet bus hole. The sink the sink had a paper

05:01.840 --> 05:07.680
sign in it that said do not use. So several of us did use the bathroom so

05:07.680 --> 05:10.840
we all kind of exchanged this glance like we'll never speak of this right? I didn't

05:10.840 --> 05:15.560
you didn't right? Did you bring hand sanitizer? Okay. But they did have one

05:15.560 --> 05:23.400
DVD on the bus and the one one a single DVD and the bus driver found it and was

05:23.400 --> 05:26.280
like let me see if we have any other DVDs but we told him to stop because the

05:26.280 --> 05:33.240
DVD was Space Jam and we said that stop looking. I want to talk about and I'm so

05:33.240 --> 05:38.160
sorry it's a beloved classic. Here he goes. There's a huge plot hole in this. He

05:38.160 --> 05:42.300
hasn't already lost you enough now he's gonna attack Space Jam. But it bothered the shit out of me

05:42.300 --> 05:46.960
today watching it. Right at the beginning Michael Jordan is crushed into a

05:46.960 --> 05:53.400
basketball by the Monstars and then later he's surprised that his body can

05:53.400 --> 05:59.720
contour into different shapes. Excuse me Michael you already done did it once. I'm

05:59.720 --> 06:05.320
just saying some inconsistencies in Space Jam. She's Andrew Dice Clay over here tonight.

06:05.320 --> 06:12.920
I don't mean to be. It did get it did inspire my oldest son to once again just

06:12.920 --> 06:19.320
check with me that Michael Jordan's a real person and not a creation of the

06:19.320 --> 06:25.000
Warner Brothers entertainment conglomerate. Our dad as far as I know

06:25.000 --> 06:31.320
did not read a book or look at a screen other than the movie Space Jam. He watched

06:31.320 --> 06:35.680
the entirety of it wrapped and I know that because every few minutes he would

06:35.680 --> 06:43.960
announce the name of the person on the screen. Jim Rome look at him. Muggsy Bogues

06:43.960 --> 06:52.200
look at him. Five foot three Muggsy Bogues is. You can be anything you want to be.

06:52.200 --> 06:56.800
Thank you that's the message of tonight's tonight's evening is you can

06:56.800 --> 07:02.360
live your dreams. You can be anything you want to be. What a beautiful venue by the

07:02.360 --> 07:06.560
way. No kidding. We were blown away this is you are so fortunate to have this is a

07:06.560 --> 07:11.480
lovely place. I asked who made the chandelier and nobody would tell me. What?

07:11.480 --> 07:15.080
Yeah I asked around I was like did you make it? They're afraid you copy it. Yeah

07:15.080 --> 07:20.080
I guess. This is as you've certainly guessed by now an advice show and we're

07:20.080 --> 07:25.520
you sent us your questions and we are gonna do our very best to answer them.

07:25.520 --> 07:30.600
Which isn't very good. No it's not good. There will also be skits if you've

07:30.600 --> 07:36.760
never listened before. What? There'll be skits and sketches and bits. There'll be

07:36.760 --> 07:42.600
bits. Okay here's the first question. For my job one of the things I've always had

07:42.600 --> 07:48.120
to do is stock the work fridge full of snacks. What a weird part of

07:48.120 --> 07:53.920
someone's adult job to have. Someone's got to do it. I'm the CEO of Apple.

07:53.920 --> 08:02.640
I live in Kansas City. Once kind of as a joke I got gogurts. Much to my surprise

08:02.640 --> 08:07.280
they were almost immediately gone. So I restocked them and have been doing so

08:07.280 --> 08:13.680
for the last two and a half years. That's a lot of gogurt. That's a lot of gogurt.

08:13.680 --> 08:20.240
Mama Mia. Recently the grocery store I go to stopped stocking them so I stopped

08:20.240 --> 08:26.960
buying them for work. That'll teach them. Yesterday my boss's boss came up to my

08:26.960 --> 08:32.920
desk, mind you this is the first time I've ever formally met this person, and

08:32.920 --> 08:44.640
asked if there's anything I can do to get the gogurts back. Brothers, how do we

08:44.640 --> 08:52.160
get more gogurt? Then that's from hurtin' for a gurtin'.

08:52.160 --> 09:06.400
It's good. It's very good. In case they hurtin' for a gurtin'. It's excellent. Are you, are you here? Yeah. Okay, got it.

09:06.600 --> 09:11.920
Okay, that sounds like someone who doesn't know how to source gogurt. Hey,

09:11.920 --> 09:17.120
real quick, just by a round of applause, if you live in this region and could buy

09:17.120 --> 09:24.000
gogurt tomorrow, please applaud. Okay, thank you. This was my suspicion. Just

09:24.000 --> 09:27.640
tell the truth, you didn't want to buy gogurt anymore. I get it, they're pricey.

09:27.640 --> 09:31.040
I do understand if you go to the place closest to your house and they have

09:31.040 --> 09:36.000
everything but gogurt, the idea of being like, time to make a second stop for the

09:36.000 --> 09:43.020
gogurt. Gross. But like, what is this store that's like, I don't know, we sell

09:43.020 --> 09:47.240
through all this gogurt all the time, but it's just one person. Maybe we should

09:47.240 --> 09:51.480
stop selling it. I'm worried about them. We have to stop selling it, but they're

09:51.480 --> 09:58.600
eating eight gogurts a day. Maybe you've maximized efficiency so much that word

09:58.600 --> 10:04.720
has spread that gogurt is the new work fuel. Oh, because it's so quick.

10:04.720 --> 10:11.600
No spoons, no bowls to wash. I could blast down a gogurt in... Can we get a

10:11.600 --> 10:15.560
gogurt to try it out? If we can have a... Yeah, Paul, gogurt? No, we don't have any gogurt.

10:15.560 --> 10:21.920
If I need gut bacteria in the next 11 seconds... There is no way. I would swear

10:21.920 --> 10:26.960
on a sack of Bibles that there is no bacteria in gogurt whatsoever. I mean,

10:26.960 --> 10:31.560
not the good kind. It's not probiotic. I was gonna say it's antibiotic, but that

10:31.560 --> 10:36.000
we probably would have heard about that. Why are both of those things good?

10:36.000 --> 10:40.480
Where's the middle ground? Where's just biotic? Antibiotic is good. Probiotic's

10:40.480 --> 10:45.320
good. It's when they get out of... It's like midichlorians.

10:45.320 --> 10:52.520
That's why Jamie Lee Curtis can move things with her mind. Gogurt is like the

10:52.520 --> 10:57.400
new Soylent for people that like to have a good time. Gogurt is a

10:57.400 --> 11:01.240
complete meal. It's got go, it's got gurt, it's everything you need for the day.

11:01.240 --> 11:05.440
It's got cream, it's got flavor, it's got cold. And sometimes there's SpongeBob on

11:05.440 --> 11:11.080
the package. If your company is only given 25 second breaks, that's perfect time to

11:11.080 --> 11:16.160
just slurp it down. You can do that as you walk to your one bathroom break for

11:16.160 --> 11:20.400
the day. No problem. You remember the commercials for like Yoplait fruit at

11:20.400 --> 11:26.560
the bottom where they mix it up a little bit and then... And it's like I've got

11:26.560 --> 11:32.320
reports to file. I've got clients I need to interface with. With the fruit at the top,

11:32.320 --> 11:37.760
in the middle, in the bottom. I'm busy. No fruit, just cream. Fast, fast cream.

11:37.760 --> 11:42.160
If I could crush it into my face. What about gogurt? Yes! They should call it

11:42.160 --> 11:47.720
fast cream for business. Sometimes when I'm on my way to do brain surgery and I

11:47.720 --> 11:51.160
only have a little bit of time between brains, I need a quick gogurt.

11:51.160 --> 11:56.000
I need a very fast... I'm an adult doctor with responsibilities. And a hunger for cream.

11:56.000 --> 12:02.600
Get me a gogurt with Anna on it. They do need to have like... It can still be the

12:02.600 --> 12:07.640
same stuff in the thing, but do have it be say fast, fast cream for business on

12:07.640 --> 12:15.960
the label. Yeah. And have like someone with... They should have a line of gogurt that's just like black and white with like a business man in a suit like, huh, time to go.

12:15.960 --> 12:25.360
This tastes like tobacco. Mmm, good. Is this resin? I love this. I don't know how good of a job you do.

12:25.360 --> 12:30.960
At your job. But if you've ever watched Survivor, you know that you want to be

12:30.960 --> 12:34.800
the one person that knows how to fish, because they're not gonna vote you off

12:34.800 --> 12:39.560
right away, because they'll get hungry. Unless you're a big person, in which case

12:39.560 --> 12:42.840
they are gonna cut you loose as soon as you hit the merge. Yeah, it's a big strong person, they'll

12:42.840 --> 12:50.560
get you get rid of you at the merge. But the point is, I... You can't be sure that you

12:50.560 --> 12:56.560
are not hanging on by a gogurt. Yeah. The one person that knows how to get gogurt, because

12:56.560 --> 13:01.880
apparently the boss's boss can't get their own gogurt. They have to come to

13:01.880 --> 13:08.280
you, their dealer. If another human being... The Gurt Smith. If another human being who is in charge of

13:08.280 --> 13:13.000
people, who are in charge of people, has to lower themselves to ask you, another

13:13.000 --> 13:19.640
human being, what can we do to get more gogurt? Yeah, that was not it. That person had to

13:19.640 --> 13:24.200
psych themselves up for that conversation for days. Like, no, I'm just gonna ask him.

13:24.200 --> 13:28.160
I'm gonna ask him today, honey. I'm gonna... You can't. I have to. I don't know where to get it.

13:28.160 --> 13:33.720
My productivity's down some. I can't do it without gogurt. It's also an optics

13:33.720 --> 13:37.360
thing, though, because if you're somebody's boss's boss, you can't roll up to the

13:37.360 --> 13:43.760
Kroger and be like, hmm, 12 packages of gogurt for me, please. I'm going to the

13:43.760 --> 13:50.840
opera later. So you're saying the employees at this Kroger are like, wait a

13:50.840 --> 13:56.160
minute. You're a boss. You can't be buying gogurt. No, no, no. Not just a boss. A super boss.

13:56.160 --> 14:02.480
You're one of the super bosses. You have bosses that answer you. Fantastic. I hope that helps.

14:02.480 --> 14:08.180
Go to another store. I had you right early. Yeah, I have a... I've got a gogurt guy in

14:08.180 --> 14:14.720
Kansas City I can hook you up with. He's got the special swamp berry flavor

14:14.720 --> 14:20.280
from... That was a promotion for Shrek Forever After. It's gonna cost you extra,

14:20.280 --> 14:26.480
but your co-workers will taste the difference. It's a finely aged... You can

14:26.480 --> 14:30.440
tell from the... It's gogurt cheese. You can tell from the rind on the outside. It's

14:30.440 --> 14:36.760
perfect. It's ready. Oh, this is... This is funky. Can I say that? This is funky.

14:36.760 --> 14:42.400
This is a funky gogurt, and I love it. Is this frozen? No, it's just solid. No, yeah.

14:42.400 --> 14:50.480
I'm sorry, by the way. I'll pack up my things and go. I work at a college, and my

14:50.480 --> 14:57.480
co-workers and I... Yeah, okay. Yeah, college is good, if you want. I work at a college, and my

14:57.480 --> 15:01.920
co-workers and I volunteered to help some nursing students with a disaster

15:01.920 --> 15:10.600
simulation. I was giving closed head... Sorry, I think that should be... I was given.

15:10.600 --> 15:15.440
Given. Although I do like... You're giving closed head wound. You're giving massive

15:15.440 --> 15:22.260
trauma. Category is closed head wound. I was given closed head wound, which

15:22.260 --> 15:26.720
basically means a concussion. My co-workers were given more intense

15:26.720 --> 15:33.560
injuries, and some even used moulage. I don't know what that means. We all know

15:33.560 --> 15:42.080
moulage is the art. I do know what it is. What is it? No, you go. Makeup, you say.

15:42.080 --> 15:48.200
Is it like decoupage? No, but I can listen to you say that word all day. Is it

15:48.200 --> 15:55.160
like decoupage? You say it like a spy in like a 1940s movie delivering a secret.

15:55.160 --> 16:00.360
Ah, my friends. Is it makeup? Is it like blood makeup? It's like a cast. Okay,

16:00.360 --> 16:07.040
that's fine. So fucking funny. I've been asked to participate again, and while I

16:07.040 --> 16:12.000
know it's important to have people with minor injuries, brothers, I want to know

16:12.000 --> 16:16.160
how I can beef up my performance. That's from It's Only a Flesh Wound. Are you

16:16.160 --> 16:22.400
here? All right. All right, good. Now the first thing I do have to say before we

16:22.400 --> 16:28.360
move on is that there are no small injuries. Yeah, they can get terribly

16:28.360 --> 16:34.360
infected and kill you. Travis or Griffin, one of them once got a pine tree needle

16:34.360 --> 16:38.480
stuck in their foot, had to go in for surgery. Anything can spiral out of

16:38.480 --> 16:43.160
control at any time. I got a kidney stone, little old thing stuck in my pee-pee

16:43.160 --> 16:49.960
works, took G-Man out of commission for the better part of a month. So they had

16:49.960 --> 16:53.840
to send Dennis Quaid in there in a tiny submarine to get it out. True, had to blast it.

16:53.840 --> 17:02.160
Anything could happen. I got a boner and crushed a man inside of me. Unrelated,

17:02.160 --> 17:05.960
those two things. And that's what happened to Randy Quaid. If you're

17:05.960 --> 17:11.680
curious, he's still mad at Griffin. You killed my brother! You killed my tiny brother

17:11.680 --> 17:19.600
with your boner! Again! Again! That's how I lost Ralph Quaid. He was the best of us!

17:19.600 --> 17:29.280
How did Randy Quaid get inside my wiener? No, Randy didn't. In this picture, Dennis

17:29.280 --> 17:33.640
did, was killed by your boner, and it made Randy so mad. Oh, I thought you were

17:33.640 --> 17:38.960
saying Randy Quaid was shrunk down in a urinal and like shot up my pee stream the other way.

17:38.960 --> 17:46.480
So here's what you could do. Screaming, hey boys, I'm back! Okay, so hey, so here's one thing you

17:46.480 --> 17:53.920
could do. Because my wiener kidnapped Randy Quaid in the 90s. One thing you could do, you do the

17:53.920 --> 17:59.400
concussion, that's child's play, anybody could do that, but you also add on

17:59.400 --> 18:06.280
another injury, just sort of on the side, just sort of along the way. Hey, while

18:06.280 --> 18:09.760
you're looking at this, is this normal? And then you pull aside your tuxedo

18:09.760 --> 18:14.480
jacket and you get a knife wound in there. Yeah, it's got to be good, too. It

18:14.480 --> 18:17.920
can't just like, I got a hurt elbow or whatever, like a piece of rebar through.

18:17.920 --> 18:21.040
You have like, you know, it's like one of those arrows through the head, but it's

18:21.040 --> 18:26.680
rebar. One they do on an old Sweeps Week episode of Grey's Anatomy. Oh, there's a

18:26.680 --> 18:31.720
bomb in my tummy! Something like that. The other students are like, hey, she's doing it again, she's

18:31.720 --> 18:37.080
adding other injuries that we're not supposed to do. What? No, I'm not! Be cool! Be cool! Be cool!

18:37.080 --> 18:41.040
I gotta follow my blitz. They said that they have an alien in their head, and that's why

18:41.040 --> 18:48.120
the injuries. I did not! I did not. It's in my tummy. Where aliens belong. You could draw

18:48.120 --> 18:52.680
like a, with black marker, like a crack on your head, and it'd be like, this is a

18:52.680 --> 18:57.960
this is a real humdinger of a concussion I got over here. It could be the story

18:57.960 --> 19:06.360
behind the concussion. It's not related to the hurricane that happened. No, it's

19:06.360 --> 19:11.440
just like, here's what happened. Like, I got a concussion from a long time ago. It's a long

19:11.440 --> 19:15.120
time concussion I've been meaning to see somebody about, and maybe you could help

19:15.120 --> 19:20.120
me with that. It always acts up during hurricanes. I got a concussion so bad. Oh, there's a hurricane coming.

19:20.120 --> 19:25.720
Oh, my concussion! Oh, what if the concussion gave you psychic powers, and now they have to deal with that.

19:25.720 --> 19:31.320
Hey, I got phenomenon, and now I can, I have psychic powers. I got a concussion so

19:31.320 --> 19:36.120
bad I fell on this knife, so I need you to do both of them for me. The knife hit

19:36.120 --> 19:41.280
me real hard, and then bounced into my tummy. A phenomenon on me. I did get telekinesis,

19:41.280 --> 19:46.640
but I do not know how to use it. Exhibit A, the knife. Trying to cut a steak,

19:46.640 --> 19:54.120
instead I cut a me. Well, maybe you will get a better injury next time. That's

19:54.120 --> 19:58.520
always possible. Or trade with somebody lazy. Yeah, somebody would love a

19:58.520 --> 20:03.480
concussion. Yeah. That way you don't, you can just show up tired. Nobody would be

20:03.480 --> 20:09.480
bad enough. I'm gonna go to sleep. Wait, no! No, stop! Or you could show up with rebar

20:09.480 --> 20:15.560
through your body, and just be like, you can't give me something else. I'm, you got

20:15.560 --> 20:21.640
to dress for the wound you want, you know? Yes, yes. Also, how good are you all at

20:21.640 --> 20:26.560
fixing stuff? Because I do actually need... This is not makeup. This is, I need medical

20:26.560 --> 20:31.800
attention right now. But please be careful. I'm just borrowing the rebar. I

20:31.800 --> 20:36.080
do have to take it back. My dad's gonna be so pissed if I don't get his rebar

20:36.080 --> 20:46.700
back to him. He's a foreman. The office I work in in downtown KC, that's Kansas

20:46.700 --> 20:52.440
City, has big open staircases down the middle of the building, and I get the

20:52.440 --> 20:57.120
pleasure of sitting directly in front of them on the second floor. Every time

20:57.120 --> 21:03.000
someone walks down the stairs, I have severe anxiety that I will look up, make

21:03.000 --> 21:09.960
eye contact, and cause someone to trip. And then we will have locked eye contact

21:09.960 --> 21:16.160
for the duration of their fall. Are you a gyroscope? Yeah, I don't think that, that

21:16.160 --> 21:21.520
part I don't think will happen, to be clear. How do I ensure that I'm not the

21:21.520 --> 21:27.200
cause of these falls? Should I avoid eye contact at all times, or will that make

21:27.200 --> 21:32.680
me seem unfriendly and standoffish? That's from Stressed Stair Watcher in

21:32.680 --> 21:38.880
Kansas City, Missouri. Are you here? All right. Way back there, because you know

21:38.880 --> 21:45.360
you can't make eye contact with us. With your incredible hypnotic eye contact,

21:45.360 --> 21:50.280
sends people to their doom. I'm pretty sure this is the plot of While You Were

21:50.280 --> 21:56.960
Sleeping. Is it? I don't think that's right. And it's so old that it doesn't

21:56.960 --> 21:59.160
matter?

22:00.560 --> 22:05.840
That's my new persona, by the way. Yeah, guy who doesn't like While You Were

22:05.840 --> 22:13.640
Sleeping. What a, what a shithead. Who likes that guy? That movie's great. Nobody

22:13.640 --> 22:20.640
is going to look, like after they fall, and the police arrive, presumably. No one

22:20.640 --> 22:26.480
is going to say, it was, it was her! She did it! She locked me with eye contact and

22:26.480 --> 22:31.280
then I beefed it! It was all her fault! Because it could be just as

22:31.280 --> 22:35.000
likely that they really wanted to make eye contact with you, and were terribly

22:35.000 --> 22:39.160
distracted by the fact that you would not look at their eyeballs. That's true.

22:39.160 --> 22:44.840
I, okay, but here's the problem, Justin. You're right. The first time. But after it

22:44.840 --> 22:48.920
happens five or six times. Never happened. It's never, I want to be clear. It's never happened.

22:48.920 --> 22:53.560
This is because they're being careful now. Super clear. Love it. Has not happened.

22:53.560 --> 22:58.040
This is fun, because you guys are like the good, like the angel and the devil of

22:58.040 --> 23:02.200
anxiety on my shoulders. That's like, if you look at someone, they will trip. And

23:02.200 --> 23:06.160
Justin's like, nah dog, don't worry about it. But Travis's anxiety, like, yeah man,

23:06.160 --> 23:11.040
it's definitely for sure, for sure, for sure, for sure. I'm just saying there's a

23:11.040 --> 23:15.920
middle ground between the fifth or sixth time. It's the third time. The third time.

23:15.920 --> 23:19.880
But if you're saying it hasn't happened or it's happened six times, the middle

23:19.880 --> 23:23.680
ground is three. No, the middle time is one time, because it will never happen.

23:23.680 --> 23:31.440
It could happen. Okay, listen. Listen. Advice. The whole time you ever see

23:31.440 --> 23:37.200
anyone walking down the stairs, just go, don't trip. Don't trip. Do not trip. Don't

23:37.200 --> 23:41.640
look at me. Don't look at me. Look at the stairs. Right foot, left foot, right foot,

23:41.640 --> 23:46.160
left foot. Grab the rail. Grab the rail. I will say, you know what, point of order,

23:46.160 --> 23:50.080
anytime that I've ever made eye contact with someone I don't know, it did prompt

23:50.080 --> 23:54.080
me to immediately focus extremely hard on what I was doing at that exact second.

23:54.080 --> 23:58.040
If I even fleetingly saw, was looking at someone, they look at back at me, I'm

23:58.040 --> 24:02.480
immediately like fascinated by the art of walking down stairs. I've never done

24:02.480 --> 24:06.360
anything so compelling in my entire life. Yeah, if I know someone's watching me

24:06.360 --> 24:12.080
navigate stairs, I'm gonna want to do the best damn job I can going down those

24:12.080 --> 24:21.280
stairs. Really? I'm not even doing a funky little step. That's how you fall down. It's not your fault at all. It's hubris.

24:21.280 --> 24:32.080
You like this shit? Whoa! I deserve that! It's not on you, it's on me! It's on me. I tried to see you walk down the stairs.

24:41.360 --> 24:46.520
Oh, hello there. Didn't see you come in. I'm Travis McElroy. You might know me as

24:46.520 --> 24:51.440
the middlest brother from My Brother, My Brother, and Me, a podcast that you're

24:51.440 --> 24:57.920
currently listening to. But I'm also a language enthusiast. Yes, that's correct.

24:57.920 --> 25:05.240
Language. I love it. But how does it work, you ask? Well, it's easy. You learn the

25:05.240 --> 25:10.560
you learn the words and you learn what they mean and then you can say them to

25:10.560 --> 25:16.960
people so then they understand. You get it, right? Well, if you

25:16.960 --> 25:21.040
don't get it, and I'm starting to think that perhaps I don't, you could check out

25:21.040 --> 25:25.960

mysterious lady this one she will always change her name and voice her story has

adopt her into your life please understand something of great

34:41.560 --> 34:46.920
importance you got ripped off spirits do not always reveal themselves immediately

34:46.920 --> 34:53.560
they do not perform on command you need to give them time and space sometimes

34:53.560 --> 34:58.600
it happens right away but it's quite rare more often than not a spirit needs

34:58.600 --> 35:05.040
months to feel comfortable well past the return window right to feel comfortable

35:05.040 --> 35:09.600
enough to begin showing activity by then you won't even remember where you got it

35:09.600 --> 35:16.040
yeah and I'll have canceled this account it also depends on your own experience

35:16.040 --> 35:21.200
with the paranormal at times I have had experiences right away but usually I'll

35:21.200 --> 35:26.280
hear from them a month or even up to six months later when things are happening

35:26.280 --> 35:35.720
finally I cannot stress it enough give spirits time give them space remain

35:35.720 --> 35:41.600
open-minded and you will be amazed God it's still there it's still there Paul

43:18.400 --> 43:22.280
like your jacket love that look thank you sir get right up on that microphone

43:22.280 --> 43:27.120
so Michael your sentence that you sent us was brothers should I keep digging

43:27.120 --> 43:34.000
this big hole under my house I might take an early guess at no but I'm gonna

43:34.000 --> 43:39.480
need more context okay so my wife and I recently got a new house or it's a very

43:39.480 --> 43:45.000
old house and well we started doing some renovating and dug under some concrete

43:45.000 --> 43:50.880
yeah yeah and we found like a brick archway oh shit and so we started

43:50.880 --> 43:56.120
digging are there any runes this season on a course of Oak Island I haven't

43:56.120 --> 43:59.760
checked yet but we're about you didn't check for runes Michael they'd be

43:59.760 --> 44:04.480
glowing I've looked but all right we're seven feet in at this point I can stand

44:04.480 --> 44:09.600
I'm pretty tall gentleman yeah and I can stand completely in this hole and just

44:09.600 --> 44:15.640
just vanish yeah sure have you okay we haven't hit the bottom yet of the archway

44:15.640 --> 44:22.160
no well it's a completely flat wall it's like plastered in okay holy so why don't

44:22.160 --> 44:26.200
you worry about hitting pipes what have you hit pipe or demons at a certain

44:26.200 --> 44:33.480
point I either have to keep going or have to stop yeah yeah if you dig if you

44:33.480 --> 44:37.480
dig half a hole that's really not anything is it so you haven't you have

44:37.480 --> 44:43.160
not exhumed the entire archway is what you're saying not completely I mean you

44:43.160 --> 44:48.800
have to get the archway out Michael what do I what else can I do you can film it

44:48.800 --> 44:54.320
for tick-tock yeah yeah you should have been filming this whole time no how much

44:54.320 --> 44:57.760
of an archaeological background do you have to that qualifies you to this

44:57.760 --> 45:02.480
exhumation also did you call fucking 4-1-1 to make sure you're not gonna zap

45:02.480 --> 45:07.560
yourself you goofball we did check that there's no electrical going through it

45:07.560 --> 45:13.840
they asked like out of curiosity why are you digging a big hole in your house

45:13.840 --> 45:19.200
did you ask about lay lines between archways what if you punch through the

45:19.200 --> 45:25.320
archway there's more house and let him talk there's a big hole under my house

45:25.320 --> 45:31.920
yeah okay that's not new information my fucking time Michael I'm drinking

45:31.920 --> 45:36.360
go-kart I have places to be you get another go-kart I wanted to know if the

45:36.360 --> 45:42.960
banana one was good or not not as good a strawberry not Michael I'm scared that I

45:42.960 --> 45:46.440
will yes your house will fall on you no no okay

45:46.440 --> 45:51.520
because it's like a hundred and ten year old house yeah so it's down yeah no way

45:51.520 --> 45:55.960
it would fall on you I'm scared that I'm either gonna unleash something yes or

45:55.960 --> 46:00.200
find treasure and I don't know what way why are you scared of treasure don't be

46:00.200 --> 46:03.800

46:03.800 --> 46:08.640
hey Michael I heard you hit me you struck gold um can I say there's a third

46:08.640 --> 46:11.680
option you should be afraid of which is you do a lot of work and find nothing

46:11.680 --> 46:16.220
yeah but like I already found a kick-ass archways I found a cool archway Michael

46:16.220 --> 46:19.600

46:30.880 --> 46:35.400
and watch Wheel of Fortune like that's nothing nothing you have to finish you

46:35.400 --> 46:39.400

46:39.400 --> 46:43.440
a day of it yeah you know many hands make light

46:43.440 --> 46:49.280
exhumation of the weird archway just gets get some friends in and you know if

46:49.280 --> 46:53.720
a demon shows up you got a little maybe a little meat between you and them yeah

46:53.720 --> 47:00.760
yeah don't invite your best friends yeah you know your strong bad friends if

47:00.760 --> 47:06.440
the moon is full maybe throw a tarp over that shit yeah if you hear whispers from

47:06.440 --> 47:12.360
inside that sound like long-lost loved ones don't know tarp it's so hard if the

47:12.360 --> 47:16.400
as bad as you want to know the truth the archway wants you even more yeah yeah

47:16.400 --> 47:22.480
you have to know that does that help Michael that helps thank you thank you

47:22.480 --> 47:36.640
next please oh thank you Amanda with our debonair cape okay and she's gone thank

47:36.640 --> 47:43.320
you tuxedo mask hello hello hello hi hey are you a fancy moth person or is that

47:43.320 --> 47:46.640
just what I'm gathering from the antennae they're horns they're horns

47:46.640 --> 47:51.840
obviously Travis Monroe you said can I bring my unicycle into places I've

47:51.840 --> 47:57.200
ridden to and set it in a corner while I go about my business and I mean my

47:57.200 --> 48:03.960
immediate answer is only if you want to walk home but go on more details so my

48:03.960 --> 48:08.880
car broke down this week and my only way to get around is with my unicycle yeah

48:08.880 --> 48:15.080
so I'm wondering if I can bring it in places and like ask do you have a

48:15.080 --> 48:20.400
unicycle parking section I don't and I don't have a bike lock because I didn't

48:20.400 --> 48:23.240
have one before and I'd have to go out of my way there's no way to secure a

48:23.240 --> 48:30.520
unicycle yeah it's so streamlined and steely no ha let them finish because the

48:30.520 --> 48:36.840
rest of that was ask the cashier to what to watch it well you know that's

48:36.840 --> 48:43.560
unacceptable right Monroe you could just you should just carry it cuz what keep

48:43.560 --> 48:47.800
riding it what if there's a long hallway you want to be ready for that you'll be

48:47.800 --> 48:52.840
so mad if you see a long hallway and you're like god damn it if only I had my

48:52.840 --> 48:57.200
unicycle I could breeze through this you can also oh here's the move right you

48:57.200 --> 49:02.160
take it in you look at the cashier and you go where do you usually keep this

49:02.160 --> 49:08.760
at this point like unicycle I have a unicycle where where's your unicycle oh

49:08.760 --> 49:13.520
I thought this was a high-class establishment can you give me what so

49:13.520 --> 49:16.160
are you talking about like grocery shopping is that the kind of thing I

49:16.160 --> 49:19.320
experienced you're talking about that you ride your unicycle to yeah or can I

49:19.320 --> 49:24.360
like take the class and put it in the corner no you can't do that unless it's

49:24.360 --> 49:30.400
clown college unless I would say if you go to the grocery store it's okay if

49:30.400 --> 49:36.760
you buy three round objects of similar weight and size see but I can't do

49:36.760 --> 49:40.440
anything with those I mean you could as long as you have like a big stick and

49:40.440 --> 49:44.880
equally weighted things on either end you could do that I'd watch that all day

49:44.880 --> 49:49.840
here's what I would say oh no this point I immediately poked a hole in my own

49:49.840 --> 49:54.720
point but I'll say it anyway who's gonna steal a unicycle because very few people

49:54.720 --> 49:59.360
know how to ride those home but I could just pick that shit up yeah I've had one

49:59.360 --> 50:04.800
stolen from me before yeah really yeah I want to know that story my parents left

50:04.800 --> 50:08.400
the garage open and it disappeared Wow what you think would be easily

50:08.400 --> 50:13.760
identified later as the only other unicycle in town yeah if you see someone

50:13.760 --> 50:18.440
riding it that's yours yeah unless you take two of them together and you're

50:18.440 --> 50:21.640
like oh that could be a bicycle time for a little frontier justice get it back

50:21.640 --> 50:26.840
does Casey have like a very active unicycle scene holy shit are you

50:26.840 --> 50:37.360
fucking kidding me that was I thought a goof but okay then yeah apparently it's

50:37.360 --> 50:41.280
pretty competitive don't ever let that shit out of your sight it's trying to

50:41.280 --> 50:45.920
sound like you could just take someone else's home with you yeah does that does

50:45.920 --> 50:51.520
that help sounds like the answer is no just use it with your legs and become

50:51.520 --> 51:00.440
gizmo duck yes we can't keep giving that answer thank you thank you thank you

51:00.440 --> 51:04.360
thank you Sam the person that asked the go-kart question initially asked if they

51:04.360 --> 51:08.960
could have a go-kart if they have one saw just leave one just you did you have

51:08.960 --> 51:13.120
one did you eat one yet I'm actually like savoring it I'm kind of having a

51:13.120 --> 51:16.040
good time just an eating goat in fact you know what actually Sam never mind

51:16.040 --> 51:22.720
these are our go-karts I'm really sorry yeah Gabriella hello hi you sent many

51:22.720 --> 51:28.040
sentences which we frown upon and now we will shame you publicly no they were

51:28.040 --> 51:32.060
good sentences though basically there's a fish tank pickup you're looking to

51:32.060 --> 51:41.800
make with baggage yes go on so I grew up with fish and I really want to in the

51:41.800 --> 51:47.960
scene this is like a raise my wool scenario or you don't reverse limp it

51:47.960 --> 51:55.160
okay we gotta remember tonight we got to make a good impression so I really want

51:55.160 --> 51:59.240
a fish tank but I'm kind of lazy and cheap so I'm not gonna put in the money

51:59.240 --> 52:03.360
or the effort to actually do it myself yeah it's a lot of fucking work sounds

52:03.360 --> 52:11.920
like another amazing is in the works listen I would take great care of them

52:11.920 --> 52:18.320
yeah I'm sure no doubt so my brother is giving his away the only issue is I have

52:18.320 --> 52:23.440
to take the fish that he is giving away as well and I really don't want them and

52:23.440 --> 52:27.920
I don't know what to do with them I would rather just pick my own cool fish

52:27.920 --> 52:33.160
yeah yeah fish his fish suck they suck and I don't know like they're real

52:33.160 --> 52:36.240
they're real betas

52:42.040 --> 52:47.280
proud of you is the problem that they are not good kinds of fish or that the

52:47.280 --> 52:51.640
fish themselves have bad attitudes bad attitude isn't it yeah what are we

52:51.640 --> 52:56.240

52:56.240 --> 53:02.000

53:07.040 --> 53:12.380

53:12.380 --> 53:17.800

answer this question I'm realizing this is a real sakes there are real fish

53:43.360 --> 53:47.000
souls on the line here I can't is below me you should take them to a fish store

53:47.000 --> 53:50.600
and give them to them see if you can trade them for better fish I'll give you

53:50.600 --> 53:54.440

53:59.360 --> 54:04.800
some some boys are home right here these are farm to tank fish right yeah hey

54:04.800 --> 54:09.680
listen by my brother's idiot fish it's either it's either you're the toilet

54:09.680 --> 54:15.080
friend what do you think you taking home these beautiful fish today is that is

54:15.080 --> 54:19.040
that anything it actually is really helpful I think I might try to trade

54:19.040 --> 54:31.280
them okay yeah awesome okay hello hello hi Tanner yeah hello hi what's

54:31.280 --> 54:35.600
hi what's your I mean I know kind of what your question is we considered

54:35.600 --> 54:38.400
doing it in the first part of the show but then when we saw you send it in for

54:38.400 --> 54:42.360
this part of the show we're like there's that's details we gotta fucking say the

54:42.360 --> 54:48.960
sentence how do I get my boss to stop yelling frog bar at me okay so there's a

54:48.960 --> 54:56.640
bit of history to this fucking of course there is Tanner so I'm in a design

54:56.640 --> 55:01.880
course in which one of our projects was to create a hypothetical business yes we

55:01.880 --> 55:06.500
were gonna designs like advertisements and social media for right so we

55:06.500 --> 55:10.880
initially thought about cat cafe but someone mentioned something about frogs

55:10.880 --> 55:17.840
and we decided to make a frog bar okay my design teacher is married to my boss

55:17.840 --> 55:23.840
we presented the project she loved it so much she kept telling my boss about it

55:23.840 --> 55:31.440
okay and now every time my boss sees me he'll be like hey frog bar yeah also

55:31.440 --> 55:37.400
your boss has forgotten your name but remembers the kick-ass frog bar idea

55:37.400 --> 55:39.960
because I'll remember frog bar for the route I'll be on my deathbed like frog

55:39.960 --> 55:45.760
bar right but what does it mean hey what's a frog bar Tanner no wait don't

55:45.760 --> 55:49.560
answer right away cuz I want to guess give us a second okay here's what it

55:49.560 --> 55:54.760
could be yeah obviously is there a frog theme bar yeah better answer we had like

55:54.760 --> 55:59.880
their senior frogs there's frog land USA and Ironton Ohio those are the two right

55:59.880 --> 56:06.720
so other answer is it's a place where you can go and really be a frog sorry how

56:06.720 --> 56:10.760
do you figure well you know how you're looking around you're like frogs got it

56:10.760 --> 56:15.800
good you know they just sit around all day it's like a it's like a fart it's like a

56:15.800 --> 56:23.400
frog action roleplay yes it could be a fart uh it could be a bar where they

56:23.400 --> 56:27.760
serve different kinds of delicious frogs in different preparing different no

56:27.760 --> 56:31.760
Tanner saying no to that one not that okay I know that's the listen in princess

56:31.760 --> 56:36.440
and the frog the animated feature film I think we can all agree the curves you

56:36.440 --> 56:45.680
they gave those frogs are this world and I don't have a follow-up to that it's

56:45.680 --> 56:52.240
just something I wanted to say out loud in front of an audience of friends those

56:52.240 --> 56:59.240
were those were some filth absolutely not

56:59.240 --> 57:06.120
Tanner free us what's a frog bar so mostly it's just a frog themed bar but

57:06.120 --> 57:10.720
we did hypothetically create like a side room where you could play with frogs if

57:10.720 --> 57:19.920
you were several tears of interactivity if you've got the money we've got the

57:19.920 --> 57:25.920
frogs baby the more you pay the more stuff they'll do

57:25.920 --> 57:42.120
you're not a cop right okay you're to tell us if you're a cop what

57:42.120 --> 57:47.560
Tanner what what you had to come up with a better bar idea than frog bar this

57:47.560 --> 57:52.640
obviously that's not the the quality of frog bar is not the fucking problem no

57:52.640 --> 57:56.560
I'm saying if Tanner has a better something that is stickier than frog

57:56.560 --> 58:05.560
bar for the boss which it sounds like very little would be yeah I got nothing

58:05.560 --> 58:10.760
you got an open frog bar Tanner yeah Tanner your dream come true yeah if you

58:10.760 --> 58:13.960
make frog bar then you don't have to see your boss sitting oh there's good yeah

58:13.960 --> 58:20.020
open frog bar and then you have a new boss it's you and you can hang a sign

58:20.020 --> 58:25.000
you can hang a sign on the outside of frog bar with a picture of your boss on

58:25.000 --> 58:29.320
it that says like this boss is not allowed inside of this guy's a real

58:29.320 --> 58:36.000
frog you don't go to frog bar right oh Tanner there's a huge audience for frog

58:36.000 --> 58:43.000
bar does that help sure yeah sure yeah we just changed your life is all golly

58:43.000 --> 58:50.920
god it's like Tony Robbins is up here all of a sudden he said not shitty Jenny

58:50.920 --> 58:57.880
last last audience question hello Jenny hi Jenny the question you sent in is I'm

58:57.880 --> 59:01.800
living in someone's attic and don't know the etiquette of bringing home a suitor

59:01.800 --> 59:08.880
teehee the teehee really sold it by the way now right off the bat I have one

59:08.880 --> 59:14.040
question the person knows you're living in the attic right yeah this isn't like

59:14.040 --> 59:20.880
a parasite situation no fantastic not quite okay so not quite

59:20.880 --> 59:28.400
no she knows I live there okay her rent okay she owns the home okay it's an old

59:28.400 --> 59:34.480
home I don't know I feel like you can hear everything there she has a child

59:34.480 --> 59:39.520
when you enter no hold on can you say that last part again but louder for the

59:39.520 --> 59:43.200
audience at home she has an eight-year-old child eight years old okay

59:43.200 --> 59:48.760
they're so they know these kids they have the Internet okay now is it the

59:48.760 --> 59:52.720
kind of thing where in order to get to your attic abode you have to go through

59:52.720 --> 59:57.440
the house yes okay so there's no way there's not like a ladder that you slam

59:57.440 --> 01:00:00.840
up through the window like Sam from Clarissa explains it all Jenny hate to

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:03.680
bring down the mood but you really should have a fire ladder if you're

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:08.120
living in the ad yeah in case of emergency do you have an egress in case

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:17.920
Swift egress some way to get out I know that you love sex and stuff but this is

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:23.480
really I don't want it if you're lighting candles or sitting the moon in

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:27.440
any way like down like putting some silk over a lamp or something that's so

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:32.040
dangerous fire escape ladder huge something that unrolls in preferably

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:35.520
seconds would be probably talk to your friend that owns the place about your

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:39.240
escape plan and the numbers that you would and where the meeting places and

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:43.520
if you want to establish a code word a code word would be great okay that's

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:48.280
also good to set up a code word with suitors yes don't make it the same code

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:56.920
word has is this it has your has the homeowner said something about this

01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:01.480
before is this a problem that has been brought to you no I have only lived in

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:08.280
Kansas City for six months okay okay that's a weird yeah that's a great

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:12.080
period of time to live in Kansas City

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:19.720
no no for life on I haven't ever brought in anybody over cuz I'm very nervous

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:24.800
yeah yeah I understand and the only I mean okay I don't know how to say this

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:29.280
well you don't have to Jenny that's never stopped us before we just go for

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:35.040

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:46.320

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:57.500
didn't I Justin Jenny said that the landlord brought over a suitor and when

01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:07.600
they made the entire house shook whoa all right nice so you actually have

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:14.680
nothing to worry about I guess a precedent has been set the problem they

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:19.000
say something the next day just like I thought we got wrong she in here judging

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.040
