WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.760
Open your minds. Open your hearts. Open your spirits.

00:49.360 --> 00:55.280
Open. Open your doors. Open your doors. Open your hands. Open your wallets. Open your wallets.

00:55.280 --> 01:02.960
Open your itunes and your zooms and your eyes and your eyes your ears and your win amps.

01:03.680 --> 01:09.520
Listening is not a two-way street. It's time now for you to relax,

01:11.360 --> 01:18.640
breathe, and learn with my brother, my brother, and me. It's an advice show for the modern era.

01:18.640 --> 01:26.400
I am Justin McElroy. I am Travis McElroy. I am Griffin McElroy. I don't like that idea that

01:27.120 --> 01:31.360
listening isn't a two-way street. You're saying that we shouldn't be having a dialogue with our

01:31.360 --> 01:35.920
fans right now? A dialogue is a two-way street, but listening is not. If listening were a two-way

01:35.920 --> 01:42.480
street, there'd just be a lot of quiet. Sure, but I just want people to feel like they can come to

01:42.480 --> 01:48.720
us and talk to us. They do, but they've already had their part of the conversation goes on for

01:48.720 --> 01:54.800
literally the entire week except for an hour. I like to imagine this for this whole week,

01:54.800 --> 02:00.400
we've been sort of sagely like nodding and stroking our chins. As the world just moans and wails.

02:00.400 --> 02:15.200
The clouds part. Just give that wisdom down. So if you're driving, stop. Go park. If you're

02:15.200 --> 02:21.680
sweeping, finish sweeping and then stop. Give yourselves to us entirely for 40 minutes.

02:23.040 --> 02:27.920
As we convert your questions into wisdom. You can call this period you listen to the show,

02:27.920 --> 02:37.760
The Calm. Welcome to The Calm. That's our new name, The Calm. This one comes from SuperSara77,

02:38.400 --> 02:42.960
which I like for the alliteration. How do I deal with my suite mate's ruckus,

02:42.960 --> 02:50.320
arrhythmic lovemaking? Her squeaking the bed is getting to me. Her squeaking bed is getting to me.

02:50.320 --> 02:57.120
Hi, reading. I've suggested the bean bag, but to no avail. I'd pop in my headphones and listen

02:57.120 --> 03:00.720
to my brother, my brother and me, but you don't put out enough episodes. Wow.

03:01.680 --> 03:05.120
I personally like that one of the complaints is that it's arrhythmic.

03:06.240 --> 03:14.000
She can just find that sweet beat. If it was just like a constant regular beat,

03:14.000 --> 03:19.200
she could just find some Tiesto song. Just throw down speed rail and just lose it.

03:21.760 --> 03:26.080
That's the answer. Whenever your suite mate starts her arrhythmic lovemaking,

03:26.080 --> 03:29.440
start pounding on the wall in rhythm and see if she falls in line with it.

03:30.800 --> 03:37.200
That would be a fun experiment. If I may suggest, don't listen to us when you're listening to your

03:37.200 --> 03:41.200
roommate's lovemaking, because that's not a Freudian mental connection that you want your

03:41.200 --> 03:46.960
subconscious to make. Maybe it would be nice every time you listen to us to think of suite

03:46.960 --> 03:51.200
arrhythmic lovemaking, but every time you hear lovemaking or participate in lovemaking,

03:51.200 --> 03:57.680
the last thing you want to be thinking about is our voices. Yeah, I disagree.

03:57.680 --> 04:02.000
Excuse me, Philip. I'm enjoying our lovemaking, arrhythmic though it may be,

04:02.000 --> 04:06.640
but I believe in order to climax, I'm going to need to turn on my brother, my brother and me.

04:06.640 --> 04:09.440
It's a podcast. You'll enjoy it. Maybe you won't. I don't care.

04:09.440 --> 04:10.400
See, now we're getting meta.

04:10.400 --> 04:14.640
If at the end of the video, I'm ready for Griffin's last question, then...

04:14.640 --> 04:23.200
Um, you should talk to your, your roommate and talk about how gross this whole,

04:23.200 --> 04:26.400
this whole scenario is because you have to see her the next morning.

04:27.120 --> 04:35.200
Uh, I, there is a reason why we make this show the perfect, uh, length for a lovemaking session.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.320
40 minutes?

04:36.320 --> 04:43.200
Well, I, I am of course, including a 35 minute get pumped nap for afterwards

04:43.200 --> 04:44.960
where you get pumped again.

04:44.960 --> 04:50.560
Oh, thank God. I was about to ask a really embarrassing question.

04:51.440 --> 04:55.200
My brother, my brother and me, uh, my brother said on a show that we do together,

04:55.760 --> 04:57.200
the ideal length for a lovemaking.

04:57.920 --> 05:01.440
I love it when people do stuff like that, just to mess with you. Like,

05:01.440 --> 05:06.400
oh, you mean it, it takes you less than an hour to climax? That's so, that's so bizarre.

05:06.400 --> 05:12.640
Uh, you don't have a 13 inch penis soft? That's, that's this, well, that must be terrible for you.

05:13.520 --> 05:18.320
Uh, penis soft was my favorite software developer in the, in the eighties, by the way.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.240
They made a lot of really great racing games.

05:20.240 --> 05:21.200
They totally did.

05:21.200 --> 05:24.000
Um, let's, how about we kick off a Yahoo?

05:24.000 --> 05:24.560
Oh, wow.

05:24.560 --> 05:25.120
Let's do it.

05:25.120 --> 05:32.480
It's early, but, um, I feel like, uh, it might be a good way to get the show started.

05:32.480 --> 05:36.560
Um, this Yahoo answer was sent in by, uh, Austin.

05:37.840 --> 05:38.400
Yeah, baby.

05:39.120 --> 05:39.440
Uh,

05:39.440 --> 05:40.160
The man, baby.

05:40.160 --> 05:40.660
Oh, God.

05:41.440 --> 05:48.480
It's from Yahoo Answers user, JustMe, who asks, why does my cat have huge boobs?

05:51.360 --> 05:55.680
Only to back to, and I'm positive she is not, nor has she ever been pregnant.

05:55.680 --> 05:59.040
I got her when she was tiny and got her spade ASAP.

05:59.040 --> 06:02.160
That is when I noticed her boobs getting bigger and bigger.

06:02.160 --> 06:03.600
Is that at all normal?

06:03.600 --> 06:04.560
She's a calico.

06:04.560 --> 06:05.280
If that matters.

06:05.840 --> 06:06.640
Oh, it matters.

06:07.440 --> 06:07.920
Fuck yeah.

06:07.920 --> 06:08.560
It matters.

06:08.560 --> 06:14.720
You know what they say about those Cali's Cali's big, big front me on this.

06:14.720 --> 06:18.080
Well, I guess on a cat, it would be like under me under me.

06:18.080 --> 06:18.800
Cod.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.800
Have you seen that Cali's under me?

06:20.800 --> 06:22.640
It is weird.

06:23.520 --> 06:23.840
Okay.

06:23.840 --> 06:30.000
Cat has some sweet tits, like really just bonds or stuff.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.040
Yeah.

06:33.040 --> 06:35.040
It's weird because it's just the back two.

06:35.760 --> 06:36.160
Yeah.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.520
I don't really like her.

06:37.520 --> 06:42.960
The her other eight possible that your cat is a boy and that's its balls.

06:44.880 --> 06:48.480
Cat have giant balls at maybe your cats.

06:48.480 --> 06:49.120
Okay.

06:49.120 --> 06:50.480
Think about this for a second.

06:50.480 --> 06:55.200
You've assumed treated your cat like you've named it Mrs Snuggle baby.

06:55.200 --> 06:58.720
And it's been your cat, your girl cat for years, right?

06:58.720 --> 07:00.320
But it's been a boy this whole time.

07:00.320 --> 07:05.760
And now it's like biologically reasserting that by increasing its ball size fourfold.

07:05.760 --> 07:08.240
And so you like see him finally be like, yes.

07:08.240 --> 07:14.320
And now it's super frustrating because it thinks it you now believe that it has a giant boobs.

07:15.920 --> 07:16.800
I hate to.

07:17.440 --> 07:20.400
I hate to do another Yahoo answer.

07:20.400 --> 07:24.720
I wasn't going to read this one initially, but the segue now it just set itself up so perfectly.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.000
And I can't remember who sent it in.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.360
So I apologize to whoever it was.

07:27.360 --> 07:30.080
But it's why Yahoo answers user at the cold train who asks,

07:30.800 --> 07:34.080
why are cats testicles furry and humans not?

07:36.480 --> 07:37.920
I would like furry testicles.

07:37.920 --> 07:38.720
Thank you.

07:38.720 --> 07:41.040
Furry cat testicles looks so cool.

07:41.040 --> 07:41.840
Don't you think so?

07:45.360 --> 07:47.920
I've had I've actually had that thought as well.

07:48.480 --> 07:52.080
I've just just look at not on an actual cat, but on a like a furry.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.280
Like a furry like a human being dressed up like a cat.

07:55.840 --> 07:56.320
Yeah.

07:56.320 --> 07:58.080
I'm just saying that that's kind of a cool look.

07:59.440 --> 08:04.320
I was actually thinking of naming my new garage band that furry cat testes.

08:05.680 --> 08:10.400
What is the what's the story with with cat balls?

08:10.400 --> 08:13.680
Are people looking at these things more than I knew that they were?

08:13.680 --> 08:17.840
Is that it's true when in the same week I get sent two questions

08:17.840 --> 08:19.760
that have to do with cat genitalia.

08:20.960 --> 08:21.680
I didn't know.

08:21.680 --> 08:26.960
Maybe it's some sort of some sort of looks like bird watching.

08:26.960 --> 08:29.840
Maybe looking at cat balls is the new watching paint dry.

08:31.120 --> 08:33.200
It's watching the cat's balls.

08:35.200 --> 08:38.240
I don't think that you should.

08:38.240 --> 08:41.680
I think it's one of the mortal sins to cover the balls of another animal.

08:41.680 --> 08:43.760
Isn't that in the Bible or something?

08:43.760 --> 08:47.680
Well, no, because cats are an exception because you're supposed to worship them

08:47.680 --> 08:50.560
and they're sweet tits and they're huge, awesome balls.

08:50.560 --> 08:54.400
Yes, God, God, you're what if?

08:54.400 --> 08:55.120
Oh, my God.

08:55.680 --> 09:02.480
What if there was a cat that had huge, huge tits and big furry balls?

09:02.480 --> 09:03.840
Do you know how hard I would jerk?

09:06.000 --> 09:06.640
Oh, Jesus.

09:06.640 --> 09:07.440
You know, forget.

09:08.640 --> 09:09.440
This would be me.

09:09.440 --> 09:10.160
This would be me.

09:10.800 --> 09:11.600
Hey, sweetheart.

09:11.600 --> 09:20.800
I can't hear our arrhythmic lovemaking over the sound of Justin furiously masturbating.

09:20.800 --> 09:23.200
Why did why did you send him that YouTube clip?

09:23.200 --> 09:24.000
I thought it was funny.

09:24.000 --> 09:24.800
Well, it's not funny.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.240
He has to stop jerking off.

09:27.520 --> 09:29.360
I'm growing concerned about him.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.120
He has he has lesions now.

09:31.920 --> 09:35.040
Listen, just toss in a bottle of Gatorade and hope for the best.

09:35.040 --> 09:42.160
What's Jay from Gmail asks us, what's the sign that I'm being a bit too touchy feely

09:42.160 --> 09:43.280
with my girlfriend in public?

09:43.840 --> 09:46.240
She's an incredibly attractive lady.

09:46.240 --> 09:51.600
And sometimes I just like to wrap my arms around her, Griffin, and pull her close to me.

09:51.600 --> 09:52.800
You know, you said my name in there.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.000
Yeah, because I feel like he was showing off.

09:56.000 --> 09:56.800
That's what I feel like.

09:56.800 --> 10:04.160
No, well, Jay, as I mean, I'm not a dictionary author, but it sounds like you're describing

10:04.160 --> 10:08.480
a hug, which I think I think hugs are still kind of cool.

10:09.120 --> 10:09.360
Yeah.

10:09.360 --> 10:10.080
Hugs are all right.

10:12.160 --> 10:14.960
The thing is, here's what I think.

10:14.960 --> 10:23.200
If they could use your picture in a catalog to sell sweaters, you're not overstepping

10:23.200 --> 10:23.680
the bounds.

10:23.680 --> 10:26.000
This is actually a pretty good rule for PDA.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.920
If someone could take your picture and someone else could think, oh, I'd like to buy that

10:29.920 --> 10:32.000
shirt, then it is OK.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.760
If someone would look at the picture and be like, what are these two creepers doing?

10:35.760 --> 10:36.800
Then it's gone too far.

10:36.800 --> 10:40.400
My rule of thumb is always, would I do this in front of my grandmother?

10:42.160 --> 10:43.360
That's a bad rule.

10:43.360 --> 10:44.320
Well, it depends.

10:44.320 --> 10:49.280
There's a lot of awesome shit in life that you can't do in front of your grandma.

10:50.320 --> 10:50.880
Or Jesus.

10:50.880 --> 10:51.600
Or Jesus.

10:51.600 --> 10:52.080
Or Jesus.

10:53.280 --> 10:54.800
Or my grandmother, Jesus.

10:54.800 --> 10:55.440
Jesus.

10:55.440 --> 10:58.000
Maybe it's a family name.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.040
Don't be a jerk.

10:59.040 --> 11:00.640
Sometimes you just can't help it, though.

11:01.520 --> 11:03.600
Sometimes you've got this super attractive girlfriend.

11:03.600 --> 11:08.320
Like, there's literally nothing you can do about it.

11:08.320 --> 11:09.840
It's a foregone conclusion.

11:09.840 --> 11:12.480
You're going to just grope a little bit.

11:13.040 --> 11:17.200
Griff, can you tack if memory serves into that last paragraph when you're editing?

11:17.200 --> 11:18.000
Uh-huh.

11:18.000 --> 11:25.520
If memory serves, from what I remember about the female form...

11:25.520 --> 11:26.880
I read in a book once.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.560
If I learned anything from watching Titanic, it's...

11:33.440 --> 11:38.000
I mean, as long as you're stealth about it, you just, I mean, you've got to understand.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.160
We got this question last week about the guy who has a friend who's too touchy feely with

11:42.160 --> 11:42.800
his girlfriend.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.520
Maybe there's a connection here.

11:45.520 --> 11:47.360
Just be polite and be conscientious.

11:47.360 --> 11:52.080
Don't do it at, like, you know, a funeral, you know.

11:52.080 --> 11:52.560
Yeah.

11:52.560 --> 11:58.240
Or look around you and see if, like, anybody else is being a weirdo with the hugs and stuff.

11:58.240 --> 12:01.600
If you're in a hug-friendly environment, you'll usually get a pretty good sense of it.

12:03.600 --> 12:08.640
And again, this is one of those, if you have to wonder about it, then it's probably already

12:08.640 --> 12:09.360
too late.

12:09.360 --> 12:09.840
Yeah.

12:09.840 --> 12:14.320
Like, if that thought crosses your mind, you're a conscientious person.

12:14.320 --> 12:19.520
You're a conscientious enough person that, you know, you're just going to have to put

12:19.520 --> 12:20.080
the kibosh on.

12:20.080 --> 12:24.240
I tell you what I cannot stand, what I can't stand for, and this was big when I went to

12:24.240 --> 12:30.160
high school, is boyfriends and girlfriends who would walk side by side with their hands

12:30.160 --> 12:32.160
in each other's back pockets.

12:32.160 --> 12:37.360
First of all, when you do that, you become a fucking tie fighter.

12:37.360 --> 12:38.720
Like, nobody can get past you.

12:38.720 --> 12:43.440
Like, you are twice, taking up twice as much space as normal.

12:43.440 --> 12:46.080
And it's hard to navigate those tight high school hallways.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.840
But also, your hands are just straight up on each other's butts.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.720
Like, there's no apologizing for that.

12:52.720 --> 12:53.760
You know what I can't stand?

12:54.800 --> 12:56.000
Creepy tiny kisses.

12:57.040 --> 12:58.160
Like, when all your friends stand behind another one.

12:58.160 --> 12:58.960
But like, multiple.

12:59.760 --> 13:01.440
Like, I love you.

13:01.440 --> 13:09.840
Yeah, I don't like it when the girl stands on the guy's feet and then grabs his wrist

13:09.840 --> 13:14.320
and then walks with him like he's a big exoskeleton.

13:14.320 --> 13:15.040
I mean, we get it.

13:15.040 --> 13:16.000
You're in love, right?

13:16.000 --> 13:17.680
You don't need to form Voltron.

13:19.680 --> 13:20.400
I hate that.

13:21.200 --> 13:25.680
How does one gain swagger when entering a club?

13:26.240 --> 13:29.760
I want to become a ladies man when I go to clubs slash parties.

13:29.760 --> 13:32.640
Any tips from swagless form spring?

13:32.640 --> 13:40.160
I'm just going to put some 50 cent over this question while you guys answer it.

13:40.720 --> 13:41.440
That would be awesome.

13:44.000 --> 13:50.240
I have a seven tiered plan for you to help you get your swagger in a club or party.

13:50.880 --> 13:54.160
Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots.

13:54.160 --> 13:58.400
Well, I mean, physical inebriation will certainly grant you swagger.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.000
Yeah, why do you think people have been doing it?

14:00.000 --> 14:01.520
This is why people pre-drink.

14:01.520 --> 14:06.320
This is why people go to like have a drink before they go to the club so they can get

14:06.320 --> 14:07.440
that swagger going.

14:07.440 --> 14:08.880
Pre-gaming is important.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.480
I would say maybe don't do shots.

14:11.520 --> 14:16.960
You got to slow build up to it with a, you know, maybe a Casey Keystone with your boys.

14:19.360 --> 14:22.560
Shots should be reserved for when you're drunk enough to not

14:22.560 --> 14:25.280
remember how shots will make you feel the next day.

14:25.280 --> 14:25.760
Right.

14:25.760 --> 14:32.560
You can't you can't go from zero to shots, regardless of what LMFAO and Lil Jon tell you.

14:32.560 --> 14:36.320
You really get the impression from that song that they walk into the club

14:37.040 --> 14:39.840
and just start pounding shots, which isn't a healthy art.

14:39.840 --> 14:43.440
No, because you'll be at that fucking club for 25 minutes and then you'll be

14:43.440 --> 14:43.920
untenable.

14:43.920 --> 14:46.640
You'll be asleep or you'll be kicked out of that club.

14:46.640 --> 14:47.920
Why is Lil Jon asleep?

14:49.040 --> 14:50.720
Lil Jon, you just got here.

14:50.720 --> 14:51.920
He's had a long day.

14:51.920 --> 14:55.200
Hey, shot, shot, shot, it's seven thirty.

14:55.760 --> 14:56.560
What are you doing?

14:57.920 --> 14:58.640
This is a chill.

14:58.640 --> 14:59.280
Drinking is good.

15:01.920 --> 15:04.480
There are other things you can do, though, to gain swagger.

15:05.040 --> 15:05.520
Okay.

15:05.520 --> 15:11.120
Aside from aside from, like, like a mental swagger, you know, where, like, you know that

15:11.120 --> 15:14.160
you maybe you get a nice haircut and you buy some new shoes.

15:14.720 --> 15:15.440
GTL.

15:15.440 --> 15:18.400
That will you GTL it and then you'll be able to swagger.

15:18.400 --> 15:22.080
Um, you could also, um, I don't know if it's possible.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.840
Can you give yourself a club foot?

15:25.040 --> 15:27.520
See, I was going to say pimp cane and tiny shoes.

15:28.480 --> 15:29.280
Oh, well, that would do it.

15:29.280 --> 15:31.440
I think that would give you a club foot, right?

15:31.440 --> 15:32.800
You want like what?

15:32.800 --> 15:34.000
Now, what is a club foot?

15:34.000 --> 15:39.040
A club foot is like from if memory serves a club foot.

15:39.040 --> 15:42.800
Is it like a foot that just kind of like stops like halfway?

15:42.800 --> 15:45.120
It's like a like a nubbin.

15:45.120 --> 15:46.480
It's like a peg leg.

15:46.480 --> 15:47.920
A peg leg.

15:47.920 --> 15:50.480
It's not a peg leg because there is something there.

15:50.480 --> 15:53.520
Um, but you don't have a whole lot of control over it.

15:53.520 --> 15:56.320
But I think that would be like the ultimate swagger.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.000
So like a foot you would wear to a club?

15:59.360 --> 16:01.440
It's that's precisely the point.

16:02.640 --> 16:06.560
I just Google image search club foot and just got a bunch of pictures of Dylan McDermott.

16:07.120 --> 16:07.760
So I don't know.

16:08.640 --> 16:10.160
I don't know what the deal is with that.

16:10.160 --> 16:13.680
Uh, I, uh, yeah, I think club foot would be great.

16:13.680 --> 16:17.040
A peg leg as Travis suggested would also be great.

16:17.040 --> 16:19.360
Um, the drinking is good.

16:19.360 --> 16:20.400
It's a mental game.

16:20.400 --> 16:21.520
Basically is what you're playing.

16:21.520 --> 16:25.840
And you need to do whatever you need to do to get your sexy right.

16:25.840 --> 16:26.800
Get your sexy right.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.320
Get your money right.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.160
Everything else will just fall right into place.

16:30.160 --> 16:33.040
If you get your money right and then you get your sexy right.

16:33.040 --> 16:33.760
Get it.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.120
Like I said, haircut.

16:35.120 --> 16:35.600
Get yourself.

16:35.600 --> 16:36.640
Get your hair right.

16:36.640 --> 16:38.080
Get your shirt right.

16:38.640 --> 16:40.000
Get your watch right.

16:40.000 --> 16:40.960
And your shoes right.

16:41.680 --> 16:42.640
Maybe a little makeup.

16:42.640 --> 16:44.880
Maybe a little man makeup.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.240
By, and by makeup, he means makeup.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.040
Like seriously.

16:49.040 --> 16:50.160
Get your makeup right.

16:50.160 --> 16:51.120
Get some blush right.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.920
Some eyeliner right.

16:53.920 --> 16:54.560
Yeah.

16:54.560 --> 16:55.440
Get all those things.

16:55.440 --> 16:57.280
And, uh, and by get your watch right.

16:57.280 --> 17:00.960
He means don't wear a watch cause it's 2010 and you've got a cell phone.

17:00.960 --> 17:01.440
You are just getting yourself right.

17:01.440 --> 17:04.480
I like Travis's idea of getting your soul right too.

17:04.480 --> 17:05.040
Yeah.

17:05.040 --> 17:05.520
Whoa.

17:05.520 --> 17:06.320
You gotta get clean.

17:07.040 --> 17:09.280
Just find out what's going on in there.

17:09.280 --> 17:14.320
Yeah, you think he's got like a swagger road bump that's keeping him from swagger.

17:14.320 --> 17:21.360
I'm saying he's got a metaphysical meteorological road bump that he needs to get right before

17:21.360 --> 17:22.880
he can get that swagger.

17:23.600 --> 17:27.440
Is, is road bump a real thing or is that a word we just invented?

17:27.440 --> 17:28.160
I'm pretty sure.

17:29.280 --> 17:33.280
I'm pretty sure three of the words I used in my last sentence were made up words.

17:33.280 --> 17:38.480
Uh, what is keeping you from swagger?

17:39.360 --> 17:43.600
What is keeping you from getting your sexy right?

17:43.600 --> 17:47.040
I think this is a job for a licensed therapist.

17:48.080 --> 17:49.760
Yeah, Travis has makes a great point.

17:49.760 --> 17:52.800
We don't want to be in up in a protracted legal battle.

17:53.760 --> 17:56.960
Um, go to a therapist, say, Hey, I need your help.

17:56.960 --> 17:59.040
Get your therapy figured out.

17:59.040 --> 17:59.280
Yeah.

18:01.520 --> 18:02.560
Get your therapist to help you.

18:02.560 --> 18:03.120
We can't help.

18:03.120 --> 18:04.240
This is too much for us.

18:04.240 --> 18:05.920
We can't tell you about your swagger.

18:05.920 --> 18:08.240
And without we, they would need videos.

18:08.240 --> 18:14.800
We would need, we would need a lengthy interview, um, to figure out at a sleep study.

18:16.800 --> 18:20.320
I have swagger in my sleep now, like involuntary swag.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.800
It makes it, it makes you very hard to sleep in a bed with.

18:22.800 --> 18:23.440
Yeah.

18:23.440 --> 18:26.800
I'll wake up, I'll wake up sometimes and my wife will be kissing me and I'll be like,

18:26.800 --> 18:27.360
what are you doing?

18:27.360 --> 18:29.680
She said, your hair just looks so baller while you're sleeping.

18:30.320 --> 18:31.680
I think you got your sexy right.

18:31.680 --> 18:32.480
Your swagger down.

18:32.480 --> 18:36.880
Like, yeah, sometimes I wake up with an empty bottle of Jägermeister next to me,

18:38.720 --> 18:40.320
but that has nothing to do with anything.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.760
That has that's neither here nor there.

18:41.760 --> 18:44.640
That's really, those two are more connected than you think.

18:45.200 --> 18:49.360
Hey, can we introduce a phrase into the consciousness of America right now?

18:50.240 --> 18:54.560
If whenever you see an unattractive person, instead of like commenting at all on their

18:54.560 --> 18:57.360
unattractiveness, can we just say that they have their sexy wrong?

18:59.200 --> 18:59.840
Yeah, I think so.

18:59.840 --> 19:03.840
So their sexy is, is, is wrong.

19:04.400 --> 19:07.600
You're, you're, you're sexy.

19:07.600 --> 19:09.280
You're, you're sexy.

19:09.280 --> 19:10.560
It's incorrect.

19:10.560 --> 19:11.280
It's incorrect.

19:11.280 --> 19:11.760
You've done it wrong.

19:11.760 --> 19:12.640
It's fallacious.

19:13.440 --> 19:14.720
Take another shot at your sexy.

19:17.360 --> 19:22.480
All my friends and everyone in my class are so immature.

19:23.200 --> 19:28.480
Anytime my teacher says the word ball or anything sounds like penis, they laugh.

19:28.480 --> 19:29.680
Should I suck it up and pretend?

19:29.680 --> 19:35.520
Sorry, tell them to shut up.

19:35.520 --> 19:40.880
Benjamin from Gmail, um, Benji, you're young.

19:41.760 --> 19:47.120
If you can't laugh about balls and words that sound like penis, what words are those?

19:47.120 --> 19:52.480
By the way, I, uh, maybe if you say the word jeans, weird.

19:55.280 --> 19:55.920
Pencil.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.240
Pencil.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.600
Maybe peen.

19:59.600 --> 20:00.320
Yeah, maybe.

20:00.320 --> 20:00.880
Pinnacle.

20:01.680 --> 20:02.400
Pinnacle.

20:02.400 --> 20:02.960
Definitely.

20:03.680 --> 20:08.400
But if you're, if you're, you're 12 years old and you're talking about Pinnacle, you have much,

20:08.400 --> 20:10.080
much bigger problems to worry about.

20:11.840 --> 20:12.400
Panics.

20:13.440 --> 20:14.000
Mincies.

20:16.000 --> 20:21.040
I think that this is the time in your life when you've got to give yourself permission to laugh

20:21.040 --> 20:23.280
at balls and words that sound like penis.

20:23.280 --> 20:27.440
I know that I actually found that kind of stuff funnier as I got older and just let,

20:27.440 --> 20:28.960
let myself go and let myself enjoy it.

20:28.960 --> 20:34.720
If memory serves, uh, we spent about five minutes on this show earlier laughing about cat balls

20:34.720 --> 20:36.080
and penises, so.

20:36.080 --> 20:37.680
I do not recall that.

20:38.160 --> 20:39.600
I'm going to have to go back and listen.

20:39.600 --> 20:40.800
I'm going to have to look at the transcript.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.640
Let's consult a stenographer and we'll, uh.

20:43.360 --> 20:43.680
Yeah.

20:43.680 --> 20:44.160
Doris.

20:44.160 --> 20:44.720
I will have to.

20:45.280 --> 20:46.160
Doris, did we talk about cat balls?

20:46.160 --> 20:46.720
Run it back.

20:48.720 --> 20:49.280
I, uh.

20:49.280 --> 20:49.520
We did.

20:49.520 --> 20:50.640
We did for a long time.

20:50.640 --> 20:53.360
I mean, we don't know how old Benjamin is.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.480
Benjamin might be, he might be 35.

20:56.480 --> 20:58.400
This may be like an adult learning program.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.640
And if that's the case, this is entirely unacceptable.

21:01.840 --> 21:06.880
If, if, if this is an adult learning program and people are laughing about balls and penises,

21:06.880 --> 21:07.920
I have bad news for you.

21:07.920 --> 21:10.960
You are in a Bill Murray movie and you need to get out.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.400
You need to extricate yourself from that.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.000
Unless it's Groundhog Day.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.280
Here's some real advice.

21:15.280 --> 21:16.320
Here's what you need to do.

21:17.280 --> 21:19.520
You need to parlay this with the ladies.

21:19.520 --> 21:22.320
So then all the dudes laugh at balls and penises.

21:22.320 --> 21:24.560
You look at the ladies and go, how immature.

21:24.560 --> 21:25.760
Am I right, ladies?

21:25.760 --> 21:27.120
I laugh at Proust.

21:31.520 --> 21:34.880
Who can laugh at anything with this cholera situation in Haiti?

21:37.360 --> 21:39.040
Um, no, don't be that guy.

21:39.040 --> 21:40.000
No, be that guy.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.600
Don't be that guy.

21:41.600 --> 21:46.880
Don't be specifically that guy, but you can be the guy who doesn't get on their reindeer games

21:46.880 --> 21:49.120
and you will seem like the smartest kid in the room.

21:49.120 --> 21:49.440
Mm hmm.

21:49.440 --> 21:50.720
And that ain't, that ain't worth nothing.

21:50.720 --> 21:51.220
Yep.

21:51.840 --> 21:52.340
Yep.

21:52.800 --> 21:53.300
Yep.

21:53.920 --> 21:55.680
Talk about a joke you heard on NPR.

21:57.840 --> 22:00.160
Will Shortz had the funniest puzzle last week.

22:00.160 --> 22:02.560
Did you hear the latest Prairie Home Companion?

22:04.560 --> 22:06.160
Guy Noir's up to his old tricks.

22:08.800 --> 22:12.400
This Yahoo Answer question that I'm reading apropos of nothing,

22:12.400 --> 22:15.760
it was sent in by Jonathan Bartram, close friend of the show.

22:15.760 --> 22:20.160
Um, which, by the way, to earn that designation, you actually have to be a close friend of the show.

22:20.160 --> 22:21.520
We don't just throw that around.

22:22.400 --> 22:28.000
Uh, but it's from Yahoo Answer user Keith Urban F, who is also a close fan of this show,

22:30.000 --> 22:30.500
who asks,

22:31.760 --> 22:33.360
Wait, Keith Urban himself?

22:33.360 --> 22:34.160
The country music?

22:34.160 --> 22:36.160
It's Keith Urban F.

22:36.160 --> 22:38.160
You're thinking of Keith Urban A.

22:39.120 --> 22:41.680
Well, we've perfected the Keith Urban series.

22:41.680 --> 22:45.680
It took us seven iterations, but may I introduce you to Keith Urban F?

22:45.680 --> 22:47.280
Keith Urban F.

22:47.280 --> 22:49.440
She thinks my track is sexy.

22:50.320 --> 22:51.760
You silly bitch.

22:51.760 --> 22:52.320
So crisp.

22:52.320 --> 22:52.800
No.

22:52.800 --> 22:54.080
Um, Keith Ur-

22:54.080 --> 22:55.200
That's not Keith Urban.

22:55.760 --> 22:56.960
That's Denny McClusky.

22:59.120 --> 23:00.480
Get your country music facts straight.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.760
You broke my heart.

23:01.760 --> 23:04.000
Keith Urban F needs to know

23:05.600 --> 23:07.120
Where can I find oil?

23:09.120 --> 23:10.080
Country oil.

23:10.800 --> 23:12.720
I would need Budweiser oil.

23:12.720 --> 23:17.520
See, now this riffing is going to be funnier than the question is.

23:17.520 --> 23:18.080
No, say it.

23:18.640 --> 23:21.840
Keith Urban F wants to know, does sausage have seeds?

23:24.800 --> 23:26.080
Of course it does.

23:26.080 --> 23:26.480
I told my friends-

23:26.480 --> 23:28.400
Where do you think more sausage comes from?

23:28.400 --> 23:32.240
I told my friends at school today that I thought sausage had seeds in it, and they all thought I

23:32.240 --> 23:35.840
was crazy, but I've always thought that sausage has seeds in it, does it?

23:37.520 --> 23:41.920
Well, if sausage doesn't have seeds, what kind of treat did I fall out of when I was eight and

23:41.920 --> 23:42.640
break my arm?

23:42.640 --> 23:43.200
Exactly.

23:43.920 --> 23:44.320
I like-

23:44.320 --> 23:44.960
Think about it.

23:44.960 --> 23:48.240
Sausage tree sounds like something it's- it's not.

23:49.280 --> 23:53.120
Sausage tree is actually a new club for discerning gentlemen that I'm opening up

23:53.840 --> 23:54.640
in 2011.

23:54.640 --> 23:54.960
Very-

23:54.960 --> 23:55.360
Get there.

23:55.360 --> 23:57.440
A very private club.

23:57.440 --> 23:58.320
Select sausage tree.

24:00.560 --> 24:02.560
Gentlemen can come and be gentlemen.

24:03.520 --> 24:05.600
And be gentlemen together as gentlemen.

24:05.600 --> 24:06.240
On each other.

24:07.120 --> 24:07.360
Yes.

24:08.560 --> 24:11.680
Your membership cards from shamanigans will be accepted.

24:11.680 --> 24:12.000
At-

24:12.000 --> 24:13.280
So just come on right in.

24:15.680 --> 24:17.360
That- it's anise, right?

24:17.360 --> 24:19.200
There are pellets in sausage.

24:19.200 --> 24:20.240
They're pellets.

24:20.240 --> 24:20.800
Right.

24:20.800 --> 24:21.680
It's gristle.

24:22.800 --> 24:23.760
No, it's not gristle.

24:23.760 --> 24:24.560
It's like-

24:24.560 --> 24:25.280
Grisham.

24:25.280 --> 24:28.880
Like flavor- it's- it's Lawrence Fishburne.

24:30.320 --> 24:31.600
It's like seasonings, right?

24:31.600 --> 24:32.880
Like pepper and stuff.

24:33.520 --> 24:34.000
Coriander.

24:34.000 --> 24:34.880
Like peppercorn.

24:34.880 --> 24:35.360
Paprika.

24:35.360 --> 24:36.000
Coriander.

24:36.800 --> 24:37.600
Paprika.

24:37.600 --> 24:42.720
Um, but I totally support the idea of planting things

24:43.360 --> 24:45.440
just to see if a tree will grow out of them.

24:45.440 --> 24:45.600
So-

24:46.240 --> 24:47.680
So just go sausage crazy.

24:48.400 --> 24:51.440
Maybe tuck a few microwavable pizzas down in the loam

24:51.440 --> 24:53.600
and see if- if a pizza tree springs up.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.760
You- you don't know until you try.

24:56.960 --> 25:02.240
Guys, if I- if I plant a bagel bite and it grows a bagel bite tree,

25:02.240 --> 25:04.640
I'm quitting my job, I'm divorcing my wife,

25:04.640 --> 25:07.600
and- because I will have everything that I will ever need.

25:07.600 --> 25:10.960
If you get that bagel bite tree and a shemale kitten,

25:11.680 --> 25:15.920
you are fucking set for at least 15 years

25:15.920 --> 25:18.080
or however long the cat stays alive.

25:18.080 --> 25:20.960
As long as people keep bringing me Mountain Dew code red,

25:20.960 --> 25:22.880
I will- I will live and thrive.

25:22.880 --> 25:25.760
What you have to do is you have to cut a Mountain Dew in half

25:25.760 --> 25:27.680
and then suspend it in a jar of water

25:27.680 --> 25:29.840
and it sprouts off new Mountain Dews

25:29.840 --> 25:31.600
and then you can cash in on that.

25:31.600 --> 25:33.840
Oh, like a little baby Mountain Dew arboreum.

25:33.840 --> 25:35.120
Um, exactly.

25:35.120 --> 25:38.400
I thought- I thought we weren't gonna turn this into a gardening podcast

25:38.400 --> 25:39.680
and give away all our secrets.

25:39.680 --> 25:42.080
You guys promised me when we- when we started.

25:42.080 --> 25:43.920
If you want- if you want gardening tips,

25:43.920 --> 25:46.640
turn into our other podcast, My Garden, My Garden and Me.

25:48.000 --> 25:48.640
How do you-

25:48.640 --> 25:49.920
It's actually- it's actually a show-

25:50.720 --> 25:53.280
It's actually a show about gardens that I do with InaGarden,

25:53.280 --> 25:54.240
the barefoot contestant.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.520
It's not- it's not very popular.

26:00.800 --> 26:01.520
How many episodes?

26:01.520 --> 26:02.160
It's actually-

26:02.160 --> 26:02.720
How many episodes?

26:02.720 --> 26:04.560
It's actively just like a half.

26:04.560 --> 26:07.440
We finished one and she had to go make some scones for Jeff.

26:10.720 --> 26:13.680
My friend recently sent me a picture of his new tattoos

26:13.680 --> 26:16.320
and I do not like them at all.

26:16.320 --> 26:19.360
We are very good friends and he respects my opinion.

26:19.360 --> 26:20.160
I don't want to lie,

26:20.160 --> 26:22.000
but I also would rather not tell him the truth.

26:23.200 --> 26:25.120
Okay, how should I respond?

26:25.120 --> 26:26.560
What a conundrum.

26:26.560 --> 26:30.160
Yeah, you've really drawn yourself into a logical corner here.

26:30.160 --> 26:33.520
Well, first of all, we need to address the fact-

26:33.520 --> 26:35.120
this question was sent in by our website,

26:35.680 --> 26:38.720
our fresh new website, which if you haven't been to it,

26:38.720 --> 26:40.080
it's mabimbam.com.

26:40.080 --> 26:40.720
Go to it.

26:40.720 --> 26:41.520
More on that later.

26:41.520 --> 26:43.600
But there's a- there's an input there

26:43.600 --> 26:45.040
where you can put in your own questions

26:45.680 --> 26:47.200
and make sure you put your name on it

26:47.200 --> 26:48.640
because this guy didn't put a name on it,

26:48.640 --> 26:50.720
so how is he going to know that this wisdom is for him?

26:51.280 --> 26:51.920
Just a cautionary tale.

26:51.920 --> 26:55.120
We know that- we know that he's not a friend

26:55.120 --> 26:57.440
of one very special gentleman

26:57.440 --> 27:00.640
who I think you- you guys all know who I'm referring to.

27:00.640 --> 27:02.480
I believe his Twitter username is LNM.

27:02.480 --> 27:02.980
Mm-hmm.

27:03.840 --> 27:04.960
LMM.

27:04.960 --> 27:05.360
Forgive him.

27:05.360 --> 27:05.840
Elnum.

27:05.840 --> 27:06.320
That's a-

27:06.320 --> 27:06.800
Elnumar.

27:06.800 --> 27:07.300
El-

27:08.000 --> 27:08.500
Elm.

27:09.200 --> 27:09.700
Elm.

27:09.700 --> 27:10.240
Pinnacle.

27:10.240 --> 27:10.740
Elmum?

27:11.360 --> 27:11.860
Elmumum?

27:12.560 --> 27:13.360
Aluminum.

27:13.360 --> 27:14.560
Al-u-min-ium.

27:15.600 --> 27:19.120
This gentleman who we will refer to by his-

27:19.120 --> 27:21.920
because this is a Christian podcast,

27:21.920 --> 27:24.640
we'll refer to him by his Christian name.

27:24.640 --> 27:30.640
That's Eric Smith from Rochester, New York.

27:31.200 --> 27:33.040
He's a reviews editor at E-bomb Nation,

27:33.040 --> 27:34.320
and he made the ultimate-

27:34.320 --> 27:35.360
Sacrifice, I would say.

27:35.360 --> 27:36.480
I don't want to call it a sacrifice.

27:36.480 --> 27:40.000
I would call it very much a skin sacrifice.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.440
It's like he's in a Saw movie,

27:41.440 --> 27:43.680
and in order to get out of some trap,

27:43.680 --> 27:45.200
he had to get this thing on his skin,

27:45.200 --> 27:47.120
which he can't use for anything else.

27:47.120 --> 27:49.200
I think it's more of a skin contract.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.120
Yeah, it's a skin contract,

27:51.120 --> 27:52.880
so you have to do this show forever.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.880
Thanks, Eric.

27:54.880 --> 27:55.520
Thanks, Eric.

27:55.520 --> 27:57.200
We're getting ready to wrap up season one

27:57.200 --> 27:58.960
and take a three-month hiatus.

27:59.680 --> 28:04.080
He got an awesome MB&B AM tattoo

28:04.080 --> 28:06.080
with our new little pack your bags guy,

28:07.600 --> 28:10.320
and you can get his tattoo on a t-shirt

28:10.320 --> 28:11.360
coming up soon.

28:11.360 --> 28:13.360
You can rip the skin off of his forearm,

28:13.360 --> 28:15.680
put it on a t-shirt, and you can just wear it.

28:15.680 --> 28:18.960
That's the kind of service that we provide here at MyBimBam.

28:18.960 --> 28:20.720
Yeah, you've earned that right.

28:20.720 --> 28:23.120
To rip his arm off.

28:23.120 --> 28:27.120
Now, to our question, you have to lie.

28:27.120 --> 28:27.920
You have to.

28:27.920 --> 28:29.680
This isn't up for debate.

28:29.680 --> 28:30.800
You have to lie.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.840
Maybe we should have connected these two points

28:33.840 --> 28:36.080
of this guy hating his friend's tattoo

28:36.080 --> 28:37.840
and Eric getting a totally sweet tattoo.

28:38.400 --> 28:39.360
We're not lying, Eric.

28:39.360 --> 28:40.880
We totally love your sweet tattoo,

28:40.880 --> 28:42.960
but this guy, it sounds like he's talking

28:42.960 --> 28:44.160
about something completely different.

28:44.160 --> 28:45.920
Your sweet tattoo and your sweet cat tits.

28:45.920 --> 28:46.960
We love them both.

28:46.960 --> 28:47.920
Here's the thing.

28:47.920 --> 28:49.840
It's one of the things that I love about this show

28:49.840 --> 28:51.440
is the thing, it's one of two problems.

28:51.440 --> 28:53.760
Either it is the quality of the tattoo is not good

28:53.760 --> 28:55.280
or the tattoo itself is bad.

28:55.280 --> 28:56.720
Now, if it's the quality of the tattoo,

28:56.720 --> 28:58.160
he can get that redone.

28:58.160 --> 29:00.000
He can go and get something over it,

29:00.000 --> 29:00.880
anything like that.

29:00.880 --> 29:03.120
But if it's just that the tattoo is stupid,

29:03.120 --> 29:05.520
like he got like Simpsons Forever.

29:06.960 --> 29:08.880
Maybe he got Brett Michael's face on his face.

29:11.680 --> 29:13.520
There's no second draft for that.

29:13.520 --> 29:14.240
That's it.

29:14.240 --> 29:15.680
That's what you're wearing forever.

29:15.680 --> 29:19.200
Wait a minute, why are we ignoring the third

29:20.160 --> 29:21.440
pretty obvious option?

29:22.160 --> 29:24.160
You have to stop being his friend.

29:24.160 --> 29:25.200
Oh, yeah.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.080
You don't want to be hanging out

29:26.080 --> 29:28.080
with a guy who has Brett Michael's face on his face.

29:31.920 --> 29:34.000
The only solution is to not be his friend anymore.

29:35.120 --> 29:37.680
Side note, unless it is actually Brett Michael's,

29:38.400 --> 29:38.880
then it's awesome.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.960
If it's Brett Michael's getting a tattoo

29:40.960 --> 29:41.920
of his face on his face,

29:42.800 --> 29:45.040
you've got like the most meta friend ever.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.960
What if it's a guy named Brett Michael's

29:47.680 --> 29:49.440
but not that Brett Michael's

29:49.440 --> 29:51.120
who got tired of all the jokes

29:51.120 --> 29:54.000
and had real Brett Michael's face tattooed on his face?

29:54.880 --> 29:55.760
Is that a cool friend?

29:55.760 --> 29:57.120
Is that somebody you want to spend time with?

29:57.120 --> 29:57.600
I don't know.

29:57.600 --> 29:59.120
I mean, I wouldn't say cool.

29:59.120 --> 30:01.680
I wouldn't say cool in the traditional sense of the word.

30:02.320 --> 30:05.440
I would say fucking insane.

30:05.440 --> 30:07.520
And you should still surround yourself

30:07.520 --> 30:08.640
with a person like that.

30:10.240 --> 30:12.000
And by surround yourself with a person like that,

30:12.000 --> 30:13.760
I mean get all of Brett Michael's,

30:13.760 --> 30:16.400
not Brett Michael's body tattooed on your body.

30:17.760 --> 30:19.360
You've got to up the ante.

30:19.360 --> 30:21.840
You've got to get a worse tattoo than your friend.

30:21.840 --> 30:24.000
So they're the ones that's uncomfortable, not you.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.200
Get a tattoo that says,

30:25.200 --> 30:26.720
my friend's tattoo is stupid.

30:27.840 --> 30:28.480
And they'll be like,

30:28.480 --> 30:29.040
you're there now.

30:29.040 --> 30:29.920
You can't get mad at me.

30:31.040 --> 30:31.600
I feel like-

30:31.600 --> 30:32.640
It's on my body forever.

30:33.520 --> 30:35.280
Maybe we need to come up with some sort of

30:36.880 --> 30:39.040
mabim bam identikit.

30:39.040 --> 30:41.280
Where like a tattoo,

30:41.280 --> 30:45.840
like a standard issue tattoo that fans can get.

30:45.840 --> 30:49.040
And it wouldn't be quite as large as Eric's.

30:49.040 --> 30:52.240
Because I don't know that any fan is as diehard as Eric.

30:52.240 --> 30:54.480
So I don't think that any other fan would be willing

30:54.480 --> 30:57.200
to dedicate so much of their body space to that.

30:57.200 --> 30:58.880
So I'm saying like maybe like a tiny-

30:59.680 --> 31:00.640
Like Griffin face.

31:01.200 --> 31:02.240
No, no, not even that.

31:03.120 --> 31:06.480
Although if you want to get my face on you, go crazy.

31:07.600 --> 31:09.040
I'm saying like a tiny little,

31:09.040 --> 31:10.880
maybe just like the size of like a pea.

31:10.880 --> 31:12.640
Like a maybe like a little one that you get

31:12.640 --> 31:15.200
in like the webbing between your right thumb and forefinger.

31:17.200 --> 31:20.000
Just so that like a secret handshake people know.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.600
You're building a new society here.

31:21.600 --> 31:23.120
I'm trying to and you guys aren't-

31:23.120 --> 31:25.520
This is kind of creeping me out actually.

31:26.560 --> 31:29.840
You took a weird turn where suddenly you want to have a,

31:29.840 --> 31:31.840
you want to like Illuminati style controlling the world.

31:31.840 --> 31:32.960
That's exactly what,

31:32.960 --> 31:36.000
but it wouldn't be Illuminati in the sense that we would like

31:36.480 --> 31:38.080
plot to assassinate the Pope.

31:38.080 --> 31:40.800
Or even have regular meetings really.

31:42.160 --> 31:46.400
If by episode 300 we have to come up with some sort

31:46.400 --> 31:48.480
of conspiracy to assassinate some sort

31:48.480 --> 31:50.640
of leading political figure or religious figure.

31:51.600 --> 31:52.080
I don't know.

31:52.080 --> 31:52.720
That would actually be-

31:53.360 --> 31:54.880
I hope that our show-

31:54.880 --> 31:55.600
All right.

31:55.600 --> 31:57.600
It's time to let you guys in on something.

31:57.600 --> 31:59.760
Go back through our archive.

31:59.760 --> 32:02.560
Every third word, write them down.

32:03.440 --> 32:04.560
Then rearrange them.

32:05.200 --> 32:05.840
You'll get it.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.520
Yeah, ask Tom Hanks.

32:07.520 --> 32:08.080
He'll help you.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.720
Mr. Hanks, do you have the codex?

32:13.280 --> 32:16.720
I need the codex to decode the show's the Illuminati plan.

32:18.400 --> 32:20.480
This is taking kind of a weird turn.

32:20.480 --> 32:23.920
Griffin, do you have a Yahoo question that will like dig us out of this odd-

32:23.920 --> 32:25.200
Yeah, I'm gonna read a Yahoo-

32:25.200 --> 32:28.080
Pope assassination path we seem to be wandering down.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.520
I'll read a Yahoo answer question.

32:29.520 --> 32:34.080
And not wandering so much as sprinting towards the assassination of a public figure.

32:34.080 --> 32:35.840
Yeah, I'm saying we're not there yet.

32:35.840 --> 32:37.920
I'm saying in like 270 episodes-

32:39.280 --> 32:43.680
We haven't earned that street cred to order the death of someone.

32:43.680 --> 32:44.400
That's fucking-

32:44.400 --> 32:46.000
That's like six years down the road.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.160
Like, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

32:48.160 --> 32:50.240
I'm just saying I want to be part of a community.

32:50.240 --> 32:52.320
And by be part of, I mean lead.

32:54.400 --> 32:56.800
And by community, you mean angry cult.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.080
Pope killing mob.

32:58.080 --> 32:59.120
Okay, okay.

33:00.720 --> 33:02.560
Max Jackman sent this one in.

33:02.560 --> 33:04.480
Can we just take a moment to soak that in?

33:07.200 --> 33:08.480
Thanks, Max Jackman.

33:10.800 --> 33:16.800
Yahoo Answers user sideways smiley face asks, is the human centipede real?

33:20.400 --> 33:23.280
That was the sound of Justin taking off his headphones and walking away.

33:25.440 --> 33:26.400
Is the human?

33:27.840 --> 33:29.200
We're done, guys.

33:29.200 --> 33:30.400
Like, our-

33:30.400 --> 33:31.120
You don't mean to show.

33:31.120 --> 33:33.040
You mean fucking humanity.

33:33.040 --> 33:33.760
People, America.

33:33.760 --> 33:35.280
I don't-

33:35.280 --> 33:37.120
I'm not gonna answer this question.

33:37.120 --> 33:40.880
I need to talk about the fact that as a society, we're done.

33:41.680 --> 33:46.320
Dog, there are people wandering around on this earth that were like,

33:46.320 --> 33:49.600
they were sitting in their den, not reading,

33:50.640 --> 33:52.240
and they suddenly realized like,

33:53.680 --> 33:55.760
this question is gnawing me too much.

33:55.760 --> 34:00.400
I've got to go ask the internet if the human centipede is real.

34:00.400 --> 34:03.520
Have you guys seen that new documentary, The Human Centipede?

34:04.400 --> 34:07.280
Have you seen that docudrama, The Human Centipede,

34:07.280 --> 34:12.480
where a mad scientist sews a person's mouth to another person's butt hole?

34:12.480 --> 34:12.720
Twice.

34:13.760 --> 34:14.160
Twice.

34:15.520 --> 34:17.040
Have you seen that movie?

34:17.040 --> 34:20.240
Because it's a true story.

34:20.240 --> 34:22.400
It was a hard-hitting introspective.

34:22.400 --> 34:26.080
It was on Nat Geo the other day, so it must be real.

34:26.960 --> 34:28.400
I was watching Planet Earth,

34:28.400 --> 34:30.720
and they were doing a special about the human centipede.

34:31.440 --> 34:33.760
You'll know if the human centipede's ever real,

34:33.760 --> 34:36.800
because you'll see me about six feet away jerking it so right.

34:40.320 --> 34:42.800
You have got to get your human centipede right.

34:45.280 --> 34:46.240
You want swagger?

34:47.520 --> 34:49.520
There's one way to have swagger,

34:49.520 --> 34:53.840
is to walk on all fours with two human beings suspended by your mouth and butthole.

34:53.840 --> 34:59.840
If you walk into a club with anything less than six legs, your sexy is not right.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.920
You've got to get your leg count right.

35:03.920 --> 35:06.640
It's so important to have your human centipede fresh.

35:06.640 --> 35:08.560
And then ask the DJ to turn on Jitterbug.

35:10.240 --> 35:11.920
People will never see that coming.

35:13.680 --> 35:19.760
I have a regimen I call GTL-NCS,

35:19.760 --> 35:26.320
and it's a gym-tan laundry new centipede segment where I cut off my back corners,

35:26.880 --> 35:29.280
and I find a new person to sew to my butthole.

35:29.280 --> 35:29.600
Right.

35:29.600 --> 35:31.440
Well, I refer to that as pruning.

35:32.640 --> 35:33.760
Rinse and repeat.

35:35.040 --> 35:37.360
You've just got to get a new person to sew to your butthole

35:37.360 --> 35:38.640
every night before you go to the club.

35:38.640 --> 35:40.160
That's what Craigslist is for.

35:44.480 --> 35:46.080
We laugh and joke, but I'm really sad.

35:46.080 --> 35:49.280
Yeah, this culture is, I'm really worried about people.

35:49.280 --> 35:53.440
Like these, we make light of these people, and this isn't a crazy person.

35:53.440 --> 35:58.320
This person is just like way stupid, like way, way stupid.

35:58.320 --> 36:01.280
That's why we do this show, because if we had to deal with this shit,

36:01.280 --> 36:05.600
if I had to deal with this shit by myself, like knowing that these people existed,

36:05.600 --> 36:11.440
and I just had to eat that knowledge and digest it myself, I would be driven crazy.

36:11.440 --> 36:14.000
Here's a scary proposal.

36:14.000 --> 36:18.640
One is that someone saw that movie and thought, oh, this is probably real.

36:18.640 --> 36:23.440
But scarier than that is that someone else said to this person,

36:23.440 --> 36:29.040
you know, that's real, and they couldn't determine on their own whether that was true or not.

36:29.840 --> 36:32.880
What we need, what I've just realized that's very important,

36:32.880 --> 36:37.120
is that we need listeners to, after they've listened to a show,

36:38.640 --> 36:42.960
track down these questions on Yahoo and then post a show link in there.

36:42.960 --> 36:46.400
So people, like, because I need the truth to get to them.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.640
What answers did people have for that Griffin?

36:48.640 --> 36:52.400
What answers did people have about is the human centipede real?

36:52.400 --> 36:55.920
Uh, I closed the window because it was bumming me out.

36:55.920 --> 36:56.400
Hold on.

36:59.040 --> 37:02.960
I can see how that could be a little depressing to have to stare at that kind of-

37:02.960 --> 37:06.960
Quentin Jeremiah replies, yes, I seen it in the park, and it's real.

37:06.960 --> 37:08.480
The film's based on that.

37:09.520 --> 37:10.240
Wait, wait, wait.

37:10.240 --> 37:10.560
What?

37:10.560 --> 37:15.840
Wait, wait, wait, he saw a centipede in the park and he got confused?

37:15.840 --> 37:18.880
Or he saw a human centipede like-

37:18.880 --> 37:23.600
He may have seen a human holding a centipede and it freaked him out.

37:24.400 --> 37:27.200
Maybe he saw a human holding a baby and he got confused.

37:27.200 --> 37:29.120
Maybe it was one of those Chinese dragons.

37:30.400 --> 37:31.840
I always get those confused.

37:31.840 --> 37:35.120
You take off the top and it's just butthole mouth, butthole mouth.

37:35.120 --> 37:40.320
Awful. Miss replies, it would be cool if it did.

37:40.960 --> 37:42.480
Uh, no, it fucking wouldn't.

37:42.480 --> 37:42.880
Would it?

37:43.920 --> 37:44.720
Would it be cool?

37:45.840 --> 37:51.120
Hey, that's cool how you have your mouth sewn to another human's butthole.

37:51.120 --> 37:52.880
That's a pretty cool thing you got going on.

37:52.880 --> 37:53.440
Awesome.

37:54.400 --> 37:55.520
I'm glad that's happening.

37:55.520 --> 37:57.840
You know, you've really got your centipede right.

37:59.920 --> 38:02.560
You can tell you've really got all your legs.

38:02.560 --> 38:05.440
Your leg count is right where it needs to be.

38:06.000 --> 38:06.560
So nice.

38:07.120 --> 38:09.760
Nothing like showing up to your high school reunion with your mouth

38:09.760 --> 38:13.600
sewed to someone's butthole to really show them how you've got your shit together.

38:14.320 --> 38:17.520
Yeah, I've only been in a human centipede for like three years,

38:17.520 --> 38:20.800
but I'm hoping to be the front segment in like four or five.

38:20.800 --> 38:22.320
But it's really going to get my-

38:22.320 --> 38:23.920
Gotta get my sex you right, gotta-

38:23.920 --> 38:25.520
It's all about the politics, man.

38:25.520 --> 38:26.720
Politics, man.

38:26.720 --> 38:29.280
If you want to be the front segment in a centipede, you gotta-

38:29.280 --> 38:33.440
You gotta eat some dookies from a man's butthole.

38:33.440 --> 38:36.640
A lot of these dookies that come up out of college with their

38:36.640 --> 38:41.120
master's degrees in buttholes and they think that they're just gonna be the front segment.

38:41.120 --> 38:43.040
It's like, hey, get in line.

38:43.600 --> 38:47.600
I mean, literally get in line behind me and sew your mouth to my butthole

38:47.600 --> 38:50.480
and we'll see what we can work out for you in a few years.

38:50.480 --> 38:51.680
But not right now, okay?

38:51.680 --> 38:54.800
Because right now he's got a second segment and it's me.

38:54.800 --> 38:58.640
I'm waiting for Daryl to die and then I'll be the front segment

38:58.640 --> 39:01.200
and I'll have a bunch of kids behind me eat my butthole.

39:02.640 --> 39:06.240
As we all know, if you're not the front segment, the view never changes.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.160
It's so true.

39:08.160 --> 39:11.200
You're just looking at the top of a person's butt your whole life.

39:11.200 --> 39:16.320
Second place is first loser and also you eat a whole bunch of poop.

39:17.280 --> 39:17.760
Yeah.

39:17.760 --> 39:19.120
That's how that phrase goes.

39:19.120 --> 39:20.880
I've never seen a human centipede.

39:20.880 --> 39:22.880
Does that front segment person, are they just like-

39:22.880 --> 39:23.840
They got a sweet deal.

39:23.840 --> 39:24.480
Wow.

39:24.480 --> 39:25.520
That's convenience.

39:26.160 --> 39:26.880
They just mostly-

39:26.880 --> 39:27.760
How pleasant.

39:27.760 --> 39:29.440
They just kick it mostly.

39:29.440 --> 39:29.680
Yeah.

39:29.680 --> 39:30.640
They just like kick it.

39:30.640 --> 39:32.560
Well, they don't kick because that could be dangerous,

39:32.560 --> 39:35.360
but they don't want to dislodge the person

39:35.360 --> 39:36.400
because they got a pretty good deal.

39:36.400 --> 39:37.120
Right.

39:37.120 --> 39:37.620
Right?

39:38.160 --> 39:39.840
I'm totally yucked out.

39:39.840 --> 39:43.040
This is like the second week in a row where when we end the show it's like-

39:43.040 --> 39:45.520
I have a serious question for you.

39:45.520 --> 39:48.000
If you're in the human centipede and you got to get out of it,

39:48.000 --> 39:52.240
would you rather cut off a person's mouth

39:52.240 --> 39:54.560
and have a mouth stuck to your butthole forever

39:54.560 --> 39:56.480
or cut off a little sliver of your butthole-

39:56.480 --> 39:57.200
Of your own butthole.

39:57.200 --> 39:59.760
And then make them have a butthole mouth forever?

40:02.480 --> 40:04.160
I think I'd rather just kill myself.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.080
You would rather kill yourself?

40:06.080 --> 40:06.400
Yeah.

40:06.400 --> 40:07.440
That's the coward's way out.

40:07.440 --> 40:09.440
That's why you'll never be front segment pussy.

40:10.560 --> 40:13.680
I still say that I would wrap myself in a chrysalis

40:13.680 --> 40:14.880
and become a human butterfly.

40:18.480 --> 40:22.400
Now I know that's caterpillars, but-

40:22.400 --> 40:23.040
Oh god.

40:23.040 --> 40:30.240
What? Mommy, what's up with that giant butterfly?

40:30.240 --> 40:32.400
It's beautiful and crying.

40:32.400 --> 40:34.400
Its thorax has three torsos.

40:36.080 --> 40:41.360
Why is that giant butterfly's middle segment wearing fubu gear, Mommy?

40:41.360 --> 40:42.320
I don't understand.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.240
I mean you would still be pooping into mouths,

40:46.240 --> 40:49.360
but you would have the great big beautiful wingspan of a monarch.

40:49.920 --> 40:52.320
And I think that that would more than make up for it.

40:52.320 --> 40:53.520
That's what happened to Lindsay Lohan.

40:54.640 --> 40:55.600
We have to end the show.

40:56.960 --> 40:57.840
I thought we already-

40:57.840 --> 41:00.720
Did we not end 10 minutes ago?

41:00.720 --> 41:03.600
I thought the show basically ended when everybody turned it off,

41:03.600 --> 41:05.360
which is a few minutes ago.

41:07.120 --> 41:11.600
So, housekeeping before we hear Griffin's last question.

41:13.280 --> 41:16.960
NBNBAM.com is brand new.

41:16.960 --> 41:24.640
It is so full of games, activities for kids, forums.

41:24.640 --> 41:26.720
You like Penguin Town?

41:26.720 --> 41:28.160
We got Penguin Town.

41:28.160 --> 41:29.920
It's like the Penguin Town of websites.

41:29.920 --> 41:32.000
There is a instant advice eight ball.

41:32.000 --> 41:38.400
Don't stop clicking until you get the special musical answer.

41:38.400 --> 41:39.360
You'll know when you get it.

41:39.360 --> 41:48.960
We'll have new pre-orders for new gear going up in the NBNBAM clothing wear store.

41:48.960 --> 41:50.560
Can we talk about some of that gear?

41:50.560 --> 41:51.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:51.600 --> 41:52.960
Yeah, talk about the gear.

41:52.960 --> 41:54.000
I feel pretty comfortable about it.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.360
We're gonna have a new shirt.

41:55.360 --> 41:58.080
It's gonna be a deep heather chocolate brown,

41:58.080 --> 42:04.160
just a really smooth mellow brown of the new Justin Russo joint,

42:04.160 --> 42:06.080
the Pack Your Bags logo,

42:06.080 --> 42:08.400
which I'm pretty sure is gonna be on the Facebook page.

42:08.400 --> 42:09.840
Pretty sure it's gonna be on the Facebook group.

42:12.240 --> 42:14.800
Also, we're gonna have the logo shirt reprinted,

42:14.800 --> 42:18.560
but it's gonna be a cardinal red color this time around.

42:18.560 --> 42:20.480
So maybe you already have one,

42:20.480 --> 42:25.120
but maybe you want a red shirt maybe to go along with all.

42:25.120 --> 42:26.960
So any outfit you wear,

42:26.960 --> 42:29.120
you can either wear a red or blue shirt with it.

42:29.120 --> 42:30.240
I remember reading that in Vogue.

42:31.120 --> 42:34.480
And we're also gonna do a mug, I believe, a coffee mug.

42:34.480 --> 42:34.960
Yes.

42:34.960 --> 42:38.640
Which is a great way to spread the word about the show

42:38.640 --> 42:40.640
if you just leave it laying around the office.

42:41.200 --> 42:43.760
Also a great way to drink hot beverages.

42:43.760 --> 42:46.480
Also hot beverages, but I'm not thinking about your pleasure.

42:46.480 --> 42:47.440
I'm thinking about mine.

42:49.440 --> 42:50.240
And lady shirts.

42:50.960 --> 42:51.600
Lady shirts.

42:51.600 --> 42:55.120
There's gonna be a dark purple lady cut of the t-shirt.

42:56.560 --> 43:00.400
Also, we've got forums now.

43:00.400 --> 43:02.880
That Facebook group is the old, old mess.

43:02.880 --> 43:03.920
I'm not going there anymore.

43:03.920 --> 43:06.240
If you want to get down to that fresh stuff, everybody.

43:06.240 --> 43:07.440
See, now everybody's on Facebook

43:07.440 --> 43:08.800
and everybody can participate in the forums.

43:08.800 --> 43:10.560
I think that both worlds can survive.

43:10.560 --> 43:14.160
It's just, I think that, I don't think it's too much to ask

43:14.160 --> 43:17.520
that people give their time to both outlets, you know?

43:17.520 --> 43:18.480
Because that Facebook group,

43:18.480 --> 43:20.080
it's a good way for people to meet people

43:20.080 --> 43:22.560
and just like, just sync up on Facebook

43:22.560 --> 43:25.760
and just match up and just hook up.

43:26.480 --> 43:30.720
And look for Craigums, our boy Craig is over there

43:30.720 --> 43:31.520
in the forums.

43:31.520 --> 43:33.760
We've titled him the cruise director.

43:34.560 --> 43:37.600
So he's there just to make sure you're having fun.

43:38.160 --> 43:42.880
If you're not, if you're not there enjoying yourself,

43:42.880 --> 43:47.120
then let Craig know and he will, he will take care of it.

43:47.120 --> 43:52.000
We got a fun thread right now full of people's costume pictures

43:52.000 --> 43:55.040
that they, they, it is fun.

43:55.040 --> 43:55.920
You guys should get up in there.

43:55.920 --> 43:56.960
I'm already, I'm already down.

43:56.960 --> 43:58.720
I got to put my Adama pictures in there,

43:58.720 --> 44:00.560
but that's, that's blowing my mind.

44:00.560 --> 44:01.600
That's, that's blowing up.

44:01.600 --> 44:02.880
That thread's doing well.

44:04.160 --> 44:05.760
And, and it's just really fun site.

44:05.760 --> 44:06.880
And if you want to talk about the show,

44:06.880 --> 44:08.640
there's lots of people there who are talking,

44:08.640 --> 44:12.480
talking about stuff and it's, it's a fun community of people.

44:13.120 --> 44:15.760
And the pre-orders for the new stuff will be up this week.

44:16.480 --> 44:17.680
Just look on the website.

44:17.680 --> 44:20.240
We'll have threads in the forum and on Facebook and everything.

44:21.120 --> 44:23.280
As always, if you want to send in a question,

44:23.280 --> 44:26.560
there's a form on the website, right on the front page.

44:26.560 --> 44:27.920
Just make sure you put in your name.

44:27.920 --> 44:30.720
That's probably the fastest, newest, hottest way to do it.

44:30.720 --> 44:31.920
But there's always email,

44:31.920 --> 44:34.960
which you can reach us at mbmbam at gmail.com.

44:36.480 --> 44:41.200
You can call us, leave a message on our voicemail at 203-mbmbam1

44:42.480 --> 44:43.920
or you can tweet at us.

44:44.640 --> 44:46.960
They'll be probably, I don't know.

44:46.960 --> 44:48.960
It's hard to get answers from Twitter.

44:48.960 --> 44:50.960
You know, it's hard to get questions

44:50.960 --> 44:52.960
because it, those, those don't last forever.

44:53.840 --> 44:54.800
Email, that's forever.

44:54.800 --> 44:57.200
Yeah, email's permanent.

44:59.200 --> 45:01.040
Oh, and if there's something you'd like the website to do

45:01.040 --> 45:04.640
that it's not doing right now, anything, just let us know.

45:05.200 --> 45:06.960
We can, we got a guy now.

45:06.960 --> 45:09.520
Got our guy, Michael DeMauro.

45:10.080 --> 45:11.760
And he will, he will set it up.

45:11.760 --> 45:13.600
He also runs thriftynerd.com.

45:13.600 --> 45:14.240
He made the site.

45:14.240 --> 45:16.080
Killer website at thriftynerd.com.

45:16.640 --> 45:19.920
Yeah, and, and he made our new website

45:19.920 --> 45:22.800
and he did a really, a really great job with it.

45:22.800 --> 45:24.960
Thank you, Michael.

45:24.960 --> 45:25.680
Thank you, Michael.

45:25.680 --> 45:26.320
We love you very much.

45:26.320 --> 45:27.120
Thank you, Mike.

45:28.240 --> 45:28.880
Thank you, Mike.

45:28.880 --> 45:31.280
I, so we want to hear, we want to hear the new,

45:32.160 --> 45:33.920
the new question here from, what do you-

45:33.920 --> 45:34.640
Well, first off-

45:34.640 --> 45:35.760
Hold on, hold on one second.

45:35.760 --> 45:39.520
AppSperience owners, you have a special treat waiting for you.

45:40.400 --> 45:42.480
Oh yeah, special, special.

45:43.520 --> 45:44.640
It's really rad.

45:44.640 --> 45:46.320
It's a bonus.

45:46.320 --> 45:48.160
You can get it through the episode bonuses

45:48.160 --> 45:49.840
if you're listening to this on the AppSperience.

45:49.840 --> 45:54.320
Yeah, I'll just say it's a wrap,

45:56.000 --> 45:59.440
perhaps from a personality we invented last week.

46:00.400 --> 46:01.040
Yeah.

46:01.040 --> 46:03.680
And it was, it's a wrap created by Liana Winternitz.

46:04.800 --> 46:05.680
Thank you, Liana.

46:05.680 --> 46:06.640
That's all you guys get though.

46:06.640 --> 46:07.360
You gotta, you gotta-

46:07.360 --> 46:09.680
That's all you, you gotta go get the AppSperience, check it out.

46:11.360 --> 46:12.480
So that's it, right?

46:12.480 --> 46:13.440
Yeah, I think that's it.

46:14.880 --> 46:15.360
Out of the junk?

46:15.360 --> 46:17.280
I've just, I've been sitting here for 10 minutes.

46:17.280 --> 46:21.760
There are two fucking great questions, and it's like Sophie's Choice.

46:21.760 --> 46:23.120
It's worse than Sophie's Choice.

46:23.920 --> 46:25.360
Because the stakes are real.

46:25.360 --> 46:27.520
The stakes are real high this time.

46:28.480 --> 46:34.080
All right, this question was sent in by Jacob Locker.

46:35.440 --> 46:41.520
It's a Yahoo Answers user, Billy Reynolds, who asks,

46:41.520 --> 46:46.960
why do Chinese people eat food?

46:46.960 --> 47:04.960
I'm Griffin McElroy, and this has been My Brother, My Brother.

47:04.960 --> 47:07.120
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.

47:07.120 --> 47:17.120
You will never know me.

47:37.120 --> 47:40.640
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.
