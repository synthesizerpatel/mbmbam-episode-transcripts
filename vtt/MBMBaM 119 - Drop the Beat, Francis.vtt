WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:47.360
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, your home

00:48.240 --> 00:54.560
for the best in fantasy football recommendations, strategy, and buds.

00:54.560 --> 01:03.920
Now, Justin, correct me if I'm wrong, because I know very little about fantasy football,

01:03.920 --> 01:08.960
but would you say that the best choice for a quarterback would be a football unicorn?

01:11.360 --> 01:15.920
What the fuck are you- can we not go- What does that even mean, Travis?

01:15.920 --> 01:20.160
Like a unicorn that's been like genetically engineered to be good at football.

01:20.160 --> 01:25.520
What? Okay, that- there are so many problems. I don't even understand-

01:25.520 --> 01:29.360
Well, because it's fantasy football. That's the good thing, because it's fantasy.

01:29.360 --> 01:30.320
Ah, fuck.

01:30.320 --> 01:37.760
Oh, okay. There's fantasy creatures. You're saying, could you have Bahama as your tight end?

01:37.760 --> 01:38.000
Yeah.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.520
As your, for example.

01:39.520 --> 01:41.680
Yeah, that probably would have made a better opening, goof.

01:42.480 --> 01:47.920
Would it be difficult to balance the sport should Ragnarok be your kicker?

01:47.920 --> 01:56.560
That's possible, yes. I think that balance is always going to be your big problem with any

01:56.560 --> 02:02.240
fantasy league. How do you separate the men from the boys, from the dragons, from the chimera?

02:02.240 --> 02:07.920
But really, I mean, that is sort of the core tenet of the draft, isn't it? I mean,

02:07.920 --> 02:12.240
that's why the draft exists. It's so you can't- even, you know, big spenders,

02:12.240 --> 02:18.800
uh, like the, like the, you know, the Middle Earth Miradons, they can't, they can't just buy up

02:18.800 --> 02:23.600
all the good players, you know? You gotta take turns to pick them like you do in a draft.

02:23.600 --> 02:28.800
Right. Somebody's trying to outflank you by picking, let's say, a griffin.

02:28.800 --> 02:29.360
Yeah.

02:29.360 --> 02:32.240
You maybe have to sneak in there and get Maurice Jones Drew.

02:32.240 --> 02:37.120
Yeah, that's the tricky- that is the tricky part. Maurice Jones Drew, by the way, is a ghost. We

02:37.120 --> 02:37.760
all know that.

02:37.760 --> 02:38.240
Uh-huh.

02:38.240 --> 02:44.000
Yeah. Which is why he's- he can play in both leagues. He's the day walker of football.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.720
He is the day walker. He is half ghost and half person.

02:47.520 --> 02:52.080
Do you- are you- now, guys, tell me about your fantasy football teams this year. I actually

02:53.040 --> 02:58.160
have one in the sweet release fantasy football league. My team is called Touchdown and Abbey.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.480
Oh, that's good.

03:00.480 --> 03:01.760
That's good. Mine is, uh-

03:01.760 --> 03:02.240
It's pretty good.

03:02.240 --> 03:08.080
Mine is- can you somehow share the logo? Because it's the greatest thing I've ever seen.

03:08.080 --> 03:08.480
It's-

03:08.480 --> 03:11.200
I don't know. I'll try to remember to put it in the forum.

03:11.200 --> 03:15.760
It's Maggie Smith being- it is the Dowager Countess being doused with

03:16.480 --> 03:20.160
Gatorade, like you do- you know how sometimes when you win a football game,

03:20.160 --> 03:24.640
they douse you with Gatorade just to say, like, good work. Have this refreshment.

03:25.200 --> 03:25.760
It's basically that.

03:25.760 --> 03:26.960
Please enjoy this refreshment.

03:26.960 --> 03:30.160
With- but with Maggie Smith. My team is called the Mario Lopez Dispenser.

03:31.040 --> 03:34.960
Do you think- do you think that, uh- that's a very good team name.

03:34.960 --> 03:34.960
Thanks.

03:34.960 --> 03:39.440
Do you think that there's ever one guy who just finished a big ball game,

03:39.440 --> 03:43.440
and maybe he has been running a lot, and he's going to go get some Gatorade,

03:43.440 --> 03:47.760
and just as he's about to get some, he's like, wait, no, wait, no, no, wait, ah.

03:47.760 --> 03:52.080
Justin, I'm not gonna- I'm not gonna lie to you. That happens once a game, I feel like.

03:52.080 --> 03:56.240
I feel like every game there's that one guy who's like, oh, oh, shit, what time is it?

03:56.240 --> 03:59.840
How much time is left on the clock? Do I have enough time to get in a- ah, man.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.000
And then you gotta wring out the coach's jacket.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.120
Yeah, and then you have to go over to the other team who lost, and be like,

04:05.120 --> 04:08.480
hey, I don't mean to rub it in. Real thirsty.

04:08.480 --> 04:10.960
Can I get some- Can I have some of that gate-gate?

04:10.960 --> 04:13.360
Oh, you got Powerade? Oh, never mind.

04:13.360 --> 04:18.400
Man, I'm switching teams. You guys got- you guys got high-ser- you got Ectocores?

04:18.400 --> 04:19.040
Oh, shit.

04:19.040 --> 04:21.280
Oh, fuck! You guys just hand out Capri Suns?

04:21.280 --> 04:24.000
You got the Lemon Twinkies? I'm switching teams.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.080
And as you know, I do not- I do not have a fancy football team name,

04:28.080 --> 04:31.280
uh, because I tested positive in the random drug testing.

04:31.280 --> 04:36.720
Yep. Now, I have to ask, Travis- I have to ask why you thought juicing-

04:38.320 --> 04:41.040
Here's where I'm confused. You're not actually the one playing the sport.

04:41.040 --> 04:44.320
There's- it's very low contact activity drafting.

04:44.320 --> 04:46.160
Well, I'll tell you what you are playing, Griffin.

04:46.160 --> 04:46.880
Mine games.

04:46.880 --> 04:47.120
Okay.

04:47.760 --> 04:48.400
Okay.

04:48.400 --> 04:48.960
I'm not sure-

04:48.960 --> 04:50.160
I wanted to take brain steroids.

04:50.160 --> 04:54.160
Okay. This- this podcast is basically brain steroids,

04:54.160 --> 04:55.840
because it makes it so much smarter when you hear it.

04:56.560 --> 04:58.720
I tested positive for my brother, my brother, and me.

04:58.720 --> 05:03.040
I'm so ashamed. I've been stripped of all my titles.

05:03.040 --> 05:03.280
Are you-

05:03.280 --> 05:05.600
He's on the bro. Did you hear? He's on the bro.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.840
This guy's bamin' over here. Call the commish.

05:08.560 --> 05:10.880
Call the commish. This guy's bamin'. He's too good at life.

05:11.760 --> 05:15.440
The life commish will- will shut you down if you're bamin'.

05:15.440 --> 05:19.120
And they- and they discover it. So keep it secret, keep it safe, but do tell a friend.

05:19.120 --> 05:22.640
Uh, on this show, we take advice, and we give it to you.

05:22.640 --> 05:23.280
Okay.

05:23.280 --> 05:26.400
We take advice, we bury it in the ground for three years.

05:26.400 --> 05:31.040
And it sprouts. It- we let the interest accrue on the advice in the smart bank.

05:31.040 --> 05:34.720
We put it in our brain wombs for nine months, and then it gestates,

05:34.720 --> 05:37.440
and then it comes out of our mouths? Ew!

05:37.440 --> 05:38.720
Ew, gross.

05:38.720 --> 05:42.560
And then it consumes us, and thus continuing the cycle.

05:43.280 --> 05:46.160
Here's our first question. Brothers, I desperately need your help.

05:46.160 --> 05:50.240
For the past eight years, I have been heavily addicted to Diet Mountain Dew.

05:50.240 --> 05:51.920
I drink three liters a day.

05:51.920 --> 05:52.240
Whoa!

05:53.440 --> 05:55.280
Obviously, this is not a good thing.

05:55.280 --> 05:58.800
I've tried to quit in the past, using other types of caffeine intake as a replacement,

05:58.800 --> 06:01.680
but I keep coming back to that sweet, sweet Dew.

06:01.680 --> 06:05.040
I can't drink coffee, and other similar drinks taste gross to me.

06:05.680 --> 06:09.440
Any suggestions before my bones melt? That's from OverDewInTheDew.

06:11.200 --> 06:12.000
Here's the problem.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.400
And you know what the problem is.

06:14.960 --> 06:19.040
You are saying, this thing's killing me slowly, but goddammit, I love it.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.440
Like, I think you may be- I think you may be-

06:21.440 --> 06:25.120
Can I just say, if- if you love it so much, just drink it.

06:25.120 --> 06:27.600
Do you really want to live a life without the Dew?

06:27.600 --> 06:30.560
Listen, if it were bad for you, they wouldn't sell it, you guys.

06:30.560 --> 06:32.400
Okay, Scott, such a good point, Trav.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.240
I know. There's regulations for that kind of thing.

06:34.240 --> 06:38.480
We have a little thing called the FDA, and if things are dangerous for you, they can't sell them.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.320
The Federal Dew Association.

06:40.320 --> 06:44.480
Yeah, which is- they're the ones that fucking took down my live wire.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.640
Thanks- thanks, FDA. You're the fucking worst.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.600
Thanks, FDA.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.600
How am I supposed to get gized and play Halo?

06:52.160 --> 06:54.320
They're also the ones that shut down JASTA.

06:54.320 --> 06:56.480
Yeah, well, that one was totally-

06:56.480 --> 06:58.080
That was a good call. That was too much-

06:58.080 --> 06:59.520
That was for the good of mankind.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.720
There's too much guarna-

07:00.720 --> 07:01.280
Guarana.

07:01.280 --> 07:06.720
I vibrated so hard that I actually went through the mantle of the earth while drinking JASTA.

07:07.360 --> 07:11.440
I actually don't- I- whenever I make references to old energy drinks,

07:11.440 --> 07:13.520
I never know, like, what the threshold is for people.

07:13.520 --> 07:13.920
Yeah.

07:13.920 --> 07:16.640
Like, if I say JASTA, are people gonna be down with that?

07:16.640 --> 07:19.440
If I talk about Surge, are people gonna be down with that?

07:19.440 --> 07:20.800
Man, Surge was so good.

07:20.800 --> 07:21.120
Surge was so great.

07:21.120 --> 07:24.800
But the question is, like, now, if you compare that to, like, a Red Bull or, like,

07:24.800 --> 07:27.520
a Monster Energy drink, would it be, like, drinking water?

07:27.520 --> 07:31.040
It's like grandpa tea. It's like nothing. It's nothing.

07:32.080 --> 07:34.880
I drank a Red Bull the other day, and three of my teeth melted.

07:34.880 --> 07:37.280
In my mouth. Just melted right there in it.

07:37.280 --> 07:39.600
Never happened when I drank Surge. I only lost one tooth.

07:40.960 --> 07:45.360
I think it- I mean, it's much like any addiction, right?

07:46.160 --> 07:48.080
Stop buying it.

07:48.080 --> 07:53.520
If you don't want to- no one has ever thrust a Diet Mountain Dew in my hand and be like,

07:54.080 --> 07:55.920
hey, bro, swish it down.

07:55.920 --> 07:57.520
And I've been like, yes.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.960
All right, you guys.

07:58.960 --> 08:02.640
Can I get a no urine guarantee? Nope.

08:02.640 --> 08:06.560
Okay. I'm not drinking this thing. Just don't buy it.

08:06.560 --> 08:09.360
And my advice to you is just to quit cold turkey,

08:09.360 --> 08:14.160
because if you allow yourself, you know, the occasional treat, you'll never stop.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.880
Like, because it'll just get you in the end, you know?

08:16.880 --> 08:21.520
I've known so many people, friends of ours, that have like smoked since they were like 15,

08:22.080 --> 08:24.720
and then they quit for like 10 years.

08:24.720 --> 08:28.480
And then one night out at a party, they're like, well, I haven't had a cigarette in 10 years.

08:28.480 --> 08:28.960
I've earned it.

08:28.960 --> 08:32.240
They have one, and pretty soon they're like two pack a day smoker again.

08:32.240 --> 08:35.040
So Mountain Dew is pretty much the same thing.

08:35.040 --> 08:39.680
But it's easier to quit Mountain Dew because, I mean, if you're a smoker,

08:39.680 --> 08:41.840
you probably associate with other people who are smoking.

08:41.840 --> 08:48.080
It's easiest thing in the world to say, hey, Dylan, you know, peel me off one of those coffin nails

08:48.080 --> 08:50.320
and let me get down the flavor highway.

08:51.440 --> 08:56.000
It's another thing to be like, oh, man, that Dew looks refreshing.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.320
I'm going to drink fucking three of those today.

08:58.320 --> 09:03.280
Why don't you just pass me that Dew, and I don't know what you'll do about it,

09:03.280 --> 09:06.320
but I would just like to drink your Dew, please.

09:06.320 --> 09:08.560
You can't bum a Dew. You've got to buy one.

09:08.560 --> 09:10.800
Can I just get like a bottle cap of Dew?

09:10.800 --> 09:12.000
I just want the flavor.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.120
I just need to taste it.

09:13.120 --> 09:16.320
If you're going out to a bar and you know you're going to party all night,

09:16.320 --> 09:19.280
you don't go out and buy a pack of Mountain Dew in advance

09:19.280 --> 09:21.120
so that you can enjoy it all night long.

09:21.120 --> 09:21.600
You know what I mean?

09:21.600 --> 09:21.840
Right.

09:22.400 --> 09:23.280
Let me hit you with this.

09:23.280 --> 09:26.480
Maybe you replace your diet Mountain Dew with Mountain Dew.

09:27.520 --> 09:28.560
Would that help?

09:28.560 --> 09:29.440
Would that help you, Ronald?

09:29.440 --> 09:30.880
And you drink more of it.

09:31.920 --> 09:32.480
You know what?

09:32.480 --> 09:33.920
I say go for the record.

09:33.920 --> 09:36.400
I don't know what the record is on drinking Mountain Dew in one day,

09:36.960 --> 09:39.280
but I feel like you've been training for it for eight years,

09:39.280 --> 09:41.440
and it's time to just go for it.

09:42.240 --> 09:42.720
That's it.

09:42.720 --> 09:44.400
Fucking make your kid smoke.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.360
Like go for it.

09:45.360 --> 09:46.400
Smoke the whole pack.

09:46.400 --> 09:47.440
Drink all the Mountain Dew.

09:47.440 --> 09:48.800
Bring yourself out in one day,

09:48.800 --> 09:51.760
or maybe go into a diabetic coma, but-

09:51.760 --> 09:52.800
No, it's diet Mountain Dew.

09:52.800 --> 09:53.680
He's going to be fine.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.000
Either way, you're going to stop drinking Mountain Dew

09:56.000 --> 09:57.840
because you'll either be sick of it or dead.

09:58.640 --> 09:59.360
Or dead.

09:59.360 --> 10:04.000
You'll just be vibrating with whatever chemicals they put into it to get that flavor.

10:04.000 --> 10:04.960
You know what?

10:04.960 --> 10:06.080
I have a great suggestion.

10:06.080 --> 10:11.360
There's a flavored vodka called Mountain Dewed D-O-O-D

10:12.160 --> 10:15.440
that you can get that is meant to taste like Mountain Dew.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.240
So maybe try that.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.520
Why are you giving out?

10:17.520 --> 10:18.000
Why are you-

10:18.000 --> 10:19.360
Maybe switch that in.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.600
And then drink like three liters of that a day.

10:21.600 --> 10:22.960
Drink like three liters of Mountain Dew flavored vodka a day.

10:22.960 --> 10:25.200
Maybe toss in some Boone's Farm into the mix.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.440
Maybe you're really going to love the way that treats you.

10:27.440 --> 10:30.240
Three liters of that a day, and you'll be right as rain.

10:30.240 --> 10:31.200
Acid rain.

10:31.200 --> 10:31.840
You're going to die.

10:32.400 --> 10:33.760
You could do what our friend Jason did

10:33.760 --> 10:35.840
and just wrestle a two liter of Mountain Dew to the ground

10:35.840 --> 10:38.320
and chug it and then throw up all over the place.

10:38.320 --> 10:38.640
Yeah.

10:38.640 --> 10:39.360
That happened once.

10:42.480 --> 10:43.840
I mean, is it that bad?

10:44.400 --> 10:46.000
I drink a lot of coffee every day.

10:46.000 --> 10:46.960
Yeah, it's super bad.

10:46.960 --> 10:49.200
Just three liters of anything a day is bad.

10:49.200 --> 10:49.600
Water?

10:50.160 --> 10:50.400
Yeah.

10:51.040 --> 10:52.240
You'll get water poisoning.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.960
I don't think you guys know how much liters are.

10:54.960 --> 10:55.920
Here's what's crazy.

10:57.120 --> 11:01.200
Three liters is one and a half, two liter bottles of something in a day.

11:02.240 --> 11:02.960
You're going to lose-

11:02.960 --> 11:07.120
That is from waking up in the morning to going to bed at night, all you're doing is drinking Mountain Dew.

11:07.120 --> 11:07.440
Yeah.

11:07.440 --> 11:09.440
A hundred ounces of water.

11:09.440 --> 11:14.480
That is only a few ounces over the daily recommended amount of water.

11:14.480 --> 11:14.640
Yeah.

11:14.640 --> 11:17.440
Why do you think they recommend less than that?

11:17.440 --> 11:18.640
For God's sake.

11:18.640 --> 11:18.960
Yeah.

11:19.760 --> 11:20.880
I don't think there's a limit.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.520
Like if you drink over this much water, you're going to be poisoned.

11:23.520 --> 11:24.960
There is in the wasteland.

11:24.960 --> 11:25.920
You guys are crazy.

11:26.720 --> 11:27.920
I just don't think it's that bad.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.080
Just, I mean, maybe cut back?

11:31.600 --> 11:32.400
Here's the problem.

11:32.400 --> 11:36.480
You got to roll it back slow because you're going to lose a lot of bladder mass when you,

11:38.080 --> 11:42.240
if you go from three liters of Mountain Dew a day to zero liters of Mountain Dew a day,

11:42.240 --> 11:47.760
your bladder is going to look like a floppy, it's going to look like an elephant's ear in there.

11:47.760 --> 11:50.000
And you don't want, like you need to upkeep that.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.920
I think you roll it back to maybe 2.5 and then 2.25 and then you slowly back, do you see what I mean?

11:56.880 --> 12:00.320
And don't be concerned when your pee is no longer electric green.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.440
That's normal.

12:01.440 --> 12:02.720
It's not going to be as fun.

12:02.720 --> 12:08.000
But I want to just dip in here real quick and say that according to Mayo Clinic,

12:08.640 --> 12:12.320
an adequate intake of water for men is three liters a day.

12:13.120 --> 12:16.720
So Justin, there's no place here for your science.

12:16.720 --> 12:18.000
So that is the thing.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.920
I say swap out one liter for water and just see how it treats you.

12:23.920 --> 12:26.800
If you can get up to where you're, nobody's drinking enough water.

12:26.800 --> 12:27.360
That's fact.

12:27.360 --> 12:28.000
That's a fact.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.360
I don't, nobody does.

12:29.360 --> 12:34.080
If you drank all that Mountain Dew, but with water, oh man, you're going to feel good.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.840
You're going to have the advantage over everybody.

12:36.640 --> 12:39.040
Can I, can I talk about real quick right now?

12:40.320 --> 12:43.040
I'm drinking tea and I'm not a tea drinker.

12:43.600 --> 12:46.800
I'm drinking Wildberry Zinger from Celestial Seasonings.

12:48.240 --> 12:51.680
Mostly because all of the, like the past six words that I said just then

12:51.680 --> 12:53.600
were like among my favorite words ever.

12:53.600 --> 12:58.400
Um, but I'm drinking it right now because I'm so hung over and

12:58.400 --> 13:01.760
literally no other substance sounds good to put in my body.

13:02.640 --> 13:03.140
Hmm.

13:03.760 --> 13:04.260
Interesting.

13:05.760 --> 13:07.120
That's a very personal story, Griffin.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.160
Thank you for sharing.

13:08.160 --> 13:11.600
I'm just saying personal and unentertaining.

13:11.600 --> 13:14.720
Listen, no, listen, you don't understand what I'm saying to this gentleman.

13:16.160 --> 13:16.880
Clearly.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.000
He should get super drunk.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.440
You get super drunk and you'll never want to drink anything ever again,

13:21.440 --> 13:23.680
except shitty Celestial Seasonings tea.

13:24.480 --> 13:25.120
You know what I like?

13:25.120 --> 13:26.960
I'm into that chai tea.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.000
Oh yeah.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.120
That's what I like.

13:29.120 --> 13:32.480
This question is boring and the answers are even more boring.

13:32.480 --> 13:35.200
Just stop drinking Mountain Dew.

13:35.200 --> 13:36.720
Just stop it.

13:36.720 --> 13:37.360
Look at me.

13:37.360 --> 13:38.320
Look in my eyes.

13:38.320 --> 13:39.600
Look in your podcast eyes.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.440
Do you want us, we can, we can shame you.

13:42.160 --> 13:43.200
Just stop it.

13:44.640 --> 13:46.240
You want to have a real addiction?

13:46.240 --> 13:50.000
Ray Charles quit heroin and smoking simultaneously.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.520
Hand smoking simultaneously.

13:52.320 --> 13:54.240
That's, that's an addiction.

13:54.240 --> 13:55.280
You don't have an addiction.

13:56.000 --> 13:56.880
You have habits.

13:57.680 --> 13:58.960
Stop drinking it.

14:00.400 --> 14:01.600
Start doing heroin.

14:02.320 --> 14:03.760
Start doing heroin.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.360
Listen to Ray Charles.

14:05.360 --> 14:06.880
You should be doing that anyways.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.920
Get that Dew off your back and get a monkey on your back.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.880
Get yourself a proper addiction like a grown up.

14:12.880 --> 14:16.480
And then get a monkey and train him to slap the Mountain Dew out of your hand.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.200
Oh my God.

14:17.200 --> 14:18.960
That's a, see, that's a good suggestion.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.320
Reverend, can you give me a Yahoo?

14:20.320 --> 14:20.880
I can do that.

14:21.520 --> 14:22.560
I'm disgusted.

14:22.560 --> 14:23.040
Yeah, sure, sure.

14:23.040 --> 14:23.520
For myself.

14:25.360 --> 14:27.200
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Jacob Locker.

14:27.200 --> 14:27.920
Thank you, Jacob.

14:28.640 --> 14:30.960
That's by Yahoo answers user, the Christ puncher.

14:30.960 --> 14:31.460
Jacob.

14:32.000 --> 14:32.960
Jacob.

14:32.960 --> 14:35.760
The Christ puncher who asks.

14:35.760 --> 14:37.920
We've had questions from the Christ puncher before.

14:37.920 --> 14:38.720
Probably.

14:38.720 --> 14:41.040
How can I make horse not bite the cow?

14:41.040 --> 14:46.400
Three days ago.

14:46.400 --> 14:47.440
Horse named Derek.

14:47.440 --> 14:48.240
Bited the cow.

14:48.240 --> 14:48.960
My dad have.

14:53.920 --> 14:54.880
Three days ago.

14:54.880 --> 14:55.760
Horse named Derek.

14:55.760 --> 14:56.400
Bited the cow.

14:56.400 --> 14:57.120
My dad have.

14:57.680 --> 15:00.800
Then the cow not tell nobody have big problems.

15:00.800 --> 15:01.520
Infection.

15:02.480 --> 15:03.520
The cow died.

15:05.760 --> 15:08.960
Bad horse make to the cow died when he are bided him.

15:08.960 --> 15:10.080
Infection.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.760
How make horse stop bided things?

15:14.800 --> 15:17.520
You know, there's, it's, it's such a common problem.

15:17.520 --> 15:20.000
Listen cows, tell somebody.

15:20.000 --> 15:20.640
Yeah.

15:20.640 --> 15:22.960
When this happens, you're the victim.

15:22.960 --> 15:24.320
See something, say something.

15:24.960 --> 15:25.360
Yeah.

15:25.360 --> 15:26.800
No one's going to turn you into ground beef.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.840
They're going to believe you.

15:27.840 --> 15:28.880
You got bided.

15:28.880 --> 15:31.600
Well, nobody wants to eat ground beef if it has big problems.

15:31.600 --> 15:32.640
Vis a vis infection.

15:33.440 --> 15:36.160
FYI, when someone says they got bided,

15:36.160 --> 15:38.800
I assume that they got played a prank on by Joe Biden.

15:40.320 --> 15:41.840
I don't think that that is a colloquialism.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.200
Have you seen the latest season?

15:43.200 --> 15:43.920
You got bided.

15:43.920 --> 15:45.360
Have you seen the latest season of Bited?

15:45.360 --> 15:45.840
He's back.

15:46.480 --> 15:47.040
He's back.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.000
He's better than ever.

15:48.880 --> 15:51.680
I saw him pull a, pull a fast one on Nick Cannon.

15:52.960 --> 15:54.480
And Nick Cannon was like, what?

15:54.480 --> 15:55.840
He was like, bided.

15:55.840 --> 15:57.440
And just before he does the prank, he says,

15:57.440 --> 15:58.720
I'm just biding my time.

15:58.720 --> 15:58.880
Yeah.

15:58.880 --> 16:00.000
He did say that.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.120
Mostly the show's pretty heavy on Biden puns.

16:03.120 --> 16:05.360
He says biding my time and not Biden.

16:05.360 --> 16:06.720
So it's like almost a pun.

16:06.720 --> 16:07.760
It's weird.

16:07.760 --> 16:09.040
And he's like chewing a clock.

16:09.040 --> 16:10.880
It's like the fucking strangest thing.

16:10.880 --> 16:11.120
Yeah.

16:11.120 --> 16:12.320
It's a really good show.

16:13.120 --> 16:13.680
Yeah.

16:13.680 --> 16:14.080
It's good.

16:14.720 --> 16:15.040
Yeah.

16:15.040 --> 16:16.080
It's a pretty good show.

16:16.080 --> 16:19.280
It's produced by the same guy that said who's your daddy?

16:19.280 --> 16:21.360
Where the girls try to figure out who their fathers are.

16:21.360 --> 16:23.120
So it's got a good pedigree.

16:25.840 --> 16:27.840
Oh, so-

16:27.840 --> 16:29.840
Don't let your horse near your cow.

16:29.840 --> 16:30.160
Yeah.

16:30.160 --> 16:30.480
Here's a-

16:30.480 --> 16:32.640
Yeah, if you can just run away, keep them separated.

16:32.640 --> 16:33.140
Yeah.

16:33.140 --> 16:34.340
Yeah.

16:34.340 --> 16:36.180
Why do you have them in the same house?

16:36.180 --> 16:37.620
Cows live in houses.

16:37.620 --> 16:38.020
Oh, yeah.

16:38.020 --> 16:38.660
Cow houses.

16:38.660 --> 16:39.140
Cowses.

16:40.660 --> 16:41.540
Travis.

16:41.540 --> 16:42.100
What?

16:42.100 --> 16:42.580
Go away.

16:42.580 --> 16:45.140
We can't reduce ourselves with portmanteau.

16:45.700 --> 16:50.980
Once we've retreated to the bastion of comedy via neologism,

16:50.980 --> 16:53.060
then I think we're pretty much sunk.

16:53.060 --> 16:53.300
Okay.

16:54.500 --> 16:55.460
I am chastised.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.340
Well, you're travtised because-

16:58.340 --> 16:58.820
Ah!

16:58.820 --> 17:03.380
Travis, can we put a ball and gag in this horse?

17:05.940 --> 17:09.700
A man in the iron mask style horse mask.

17:09.700 --> 17:11.380
Do you guys have a question?

17:11.380 --> 17:12.100
Yeah.

17:12.100 --> 17:14.100
Do you feel like this hasn't been very funny so far?

17:14.820 --> 17:16.340
What, this question or this episode?

17:16.340 --> 17:17.380
That episode.

17:17.380 --> 17:18.660
Yeah, I feel like we're nailing it.

17:20.820 --> 17:22.660
Griffin, what do you think has been the funniest part?

17:22.660 --> 17:29.940
We talked about fantasy football and we all sort of brought out all of the Final Fantasy

17:29.940 --> 17:30.740
summons that we knew.

17:31.460 --> 17:33.540
That was probably the highlight for me.

17:34.100 --> 17:34.980
That was pretty good.

17:34.980 --> 17:36.740
Justin, what's your favorite part so far?

17:36.740 --> 17:40.260
What I wanted to do was remind people that there were some good things in there,

17:40.260 --> 17:44.660
because I feel like they might be trying to get way down with how we have said too many

17:44.660 --> 17:44.740
funny things.

17:44.740 --> 17:50.020
No, and you know, there probably are those people that, you know, they hold up the stopwatch

17:50.020 --> 17:53.060
and they time it out every time they reset it, you know?

17:53.060 --> 17:54.580
Just to see if it would break that 10 minute.

17:54.580 --> 17:55.780
How many giggles per minute?

17:55.780 --> 17:58.980
Yeah, if it hits that 10 minute mark, maybe you go turn it off.

17:58.980 --> 18:00.260
Maybe you go listen to the new WTF.

18:01.300 --> 18:03.540
I'm sure that that's a thing that people are doing.

18:03.540 --> 18:04.260
And you know what?

18:04.260 --> 18:04.740
That's fine.

18:04.740 --> 18:05.460
I like the challenge.

18:06.180 --> 18:10.340
But I think there's probably an even larger number of people that simply haven't turned

18:10.340 --> 18:13.460
it off because both of their hands have the vacuum in it.

18:13.460 --> 18:16.340
So they figure, well, I'm sure it's going to turn it off.

18:16.340 --> 18:22.020
Now let me just ask real quick, what kind of vacuum, what kind of broadsword vacuum

18:22.020 --> 18:25.460
are these people using that they need two hands to wield its mighty power?

18:26.820 --> 18:27.700
The dust slayer.

18:28.820 --> 18:29.940
They're using the Dyson.

18:29.940 --> 18:30.740
Oh, I see.

18:33.060 --> 18:38.180
One hand to sweep and the other hand to jerk off.

18:38.180 --> 18:39.940
I was going to say jerk off.

18:39.940 --> 18:41.380
I was going to say jerk off too.

18:41.380 --> 18:44.820
So we can all agree that there are people out there listening to our show,

18:44.820 --> 18:47.060
jerking off and then vacuuming up their jizz.

18:47.060 --> 18:47.940
This is a thing that's happening.

18:47.940 --> 18:49.220
They call it vacuuming.

18:49.220 --> 18:49.700
Oh, OK.

18:49.700 --> 18:49.940
Yeah.

18:49.940 --> 18:50.900
They're vacuuming off.

18:50.900 --> 18:51.460
Not vacuuming off.

18:51.460 --> 18:52.500
Thanks, Travis.

18:52.500 --> 18:53.700
OK, thanks.

18:54.580 --> 18:55.060
Thanks.

18:55.060 --> 18:55.860
You guys.

18:55.860 --> 18:56.820
How about another question?

18:56.820 --> 18:57.860
How about another Yahoo?

18:57.860 --> 19:00.020
That one wasn't good.

19:00.020 --> 19:00.740
Let's try a different one.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.020
This one I found.

19:02.020 --> 19:07.460
It's by the Christ Puncher who asks, should NFL teams have to reserve a roster spot for

19:07.460 --> 19:07.960
a horse?

19:09.380 --> 19:14.260
I think it is the least the NFL could do to honor the horse in, quite frankly, America.

19:14.260 --> 19:16.340
After all, they sing that song before each game.

19:16.340 --> 19:17.860
Why not have a horse on each team?

19:17.860 --> 19:19.700
Does the NFL hate America or something?

19:20.980 --> 19:21.860
Wow.

19:21.860 --> 19:24.260
Why is Christ Puncher so obsessed with horses?

19:24.260 --> 19:25.220
Why aren't you?

19:26.020 --> 19:26.740
Why are we?

19:27.460 --> 19:28.180
Fair enough.

19:28.180 --> 19:29.060
More accurately.

19:30.260 --> 19:30.820
We love them.

19:31.620 --> 19:35.300
Wasn't there a movie in which like a horse was like the kicker for a team or something?

19:35.300 --> 19:36.180
Am I making that up?

19:36.180 --> 19:37.780
It was a donkey named Gus.

19:39.540 --> 19:40.500
How do you know that?

19:40.500 --> 19:46.660
Because I love the work of the fucking, who's that?

19:46.660 --> 19:48.340
Who's that son of a bitch from Andy Griffith?

19:48.340 --> 19:48.980
Don't help him.

19:51.060 --> 19:54.020
Not Don Adams, but the guy whose name is like Don Adams.

19:54.020 --> 19:55.060
Don Cheadle.

19:55.060 --> 19:56.020
Don McClain.

19:56.020 --> 19:57.700
No, he's got like a rubber face.

19:58.740 --> 20:00.660
And he's like Don Draper.

20:01.220 --> 20:02.820
No, Don Draper.

20:02.820 --> 20:04.020
I think it's Don Draper.

20:04.020 --> 20:06.020
No, and it's not Don Adams.

20:06.020 --> 20:06.820
Randy Griffith.

20:06.820 --> 20:07.940
Randy Griffith?

20:07.940 --> 20:08.980
Is it Randy?

20:08.980 --> 20:10.180
Randy Griffith.

20:10.180 --> 20:11.460
He played Barney Fife.

20:12.100 --> 20:12.600
Yes.

20:13.060 --> 20:13.780
Tandy Griffith.

20:14.820 --> 20:16.660
It's not Tandy Griffith.

20:16.660 --> 20:17.860
He played Barney Fife.

20:17.860 --> 20:19.060
Who played Barney Fife?

20:19.060 --> 20:19.780
Barney Griffith.

20:19.780 --> 20:20.100
Randy.

20:20.100 --> 20:20.740
I'm not gonna.

20:20.740 --> 20:21.780
Randy Candy Griffith.

20:22.340 --> 20:22.900
Sidney.

20:22.900 --> 20:23.540
Sidney's here.

20:23.540 --> 20:24.500
Who played Barney Fife?

20:27.860 --> 20:31.620
If I was a real quick aside while Justin's talking, getting a, phoning a friend.

20:31.620 --> 20:35.380
I'm just saying that if I was a male stripper, my name would be Randy Candy Griffith.

20:35.380 --> 20:38.900
Don Knotts, you motherfucking assholes.

20:38.900 --> 20:41.540
Sorry, you just got phased by my memory.

20:41.540 --> 20:42.740
You got bided.

20:42.740 --> 20:45.780
You just got bided because I remembered it's Don Knotts.

20:46.820 --> 20:51.940
We got running backs, we got quarterbacks, halfbacks, fullbacks, wide receivers, tight ends.

20:51.940 --> 20:52.500
Bear backs.

20:52.500 --> 20:53.220
Safeties.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.420
Thank you, that, that's the name, there you go.

20:56.420 --> 21:00.180
That's, you got, and then you can probably swap out one of the running backs with a bear back.

21:00.180 --> 21:01.060
Here's the question.

21:01.060 --> 21:04.580
Can the other running back mount the horse and ride it into the end zone?

21:04.580 --> 21:08.180
Because that horse has no other means to, to, to carry the ball, you know?

21:08.180 --> 21:11.860
Yes, but the trick is, it also works in the reverse.

21:11.860 --> 21:13.860
The horse can jump on his back.

21:13.860 --> 21:15.860
My problem with football is there's no strategy.

21:15.860 --> 21:22.180
So I think that this will finally introduce a layer of strategy where, you know, do I get on the horse now?

21:22.180 --> 21:23.220
Is this the right moment?

21:23.220 --> 21:24.340
Is he going to buck me off?

21:24.340 --> 21:25.620
Is this the right horse?

21:25.620 --> 21:27.220
Is this the right horse for me?

21:28.340 --> 21:29.300
Will this horse and I fight?

21:29.300 --> 21:30.340
Do I need to shop around?

21:30.340 --> 21:31.860
Should I check out other horses first?

21:31.860 --> 21:33.220
Is it too early to make a commitment?

21:33.220 --> 21:34.180
Will we have a bond?

21:34.180 --> 21:37.620
Will somebody else on this team, do they have the potential to maybe have a stronger bond?

21:37.620 --> 21:39.620
Do I have a stronger bond with this horse?

21:39.620 --> 21:41.620
Is this even right for me?

21:41.620 --> 21:42.660
Oh, am I horse blocking someone?

21:42.660 --> 21:44.260
Yeah, you gotta be careful.

21:44.260 --> 21:47.860
Is this even right for me to dominate one of God's creatures like this for transportation?

21:47.860 --> 21:48.420
Right.

21:48.420 --> 21:49.380
What will Peeta think?

21:50.340 --> 21:52.020
How many horse powers is this horse?

21:53.860 --> 21:55.220
The answer's always one.

21:55.220 --> 21:55.780
I don't think-

21:55.780 --> 21:56.820
What horse powers does it have?

21:57.940 --> 21:58.980
I don't think that's true.

21:58.980 --> 22:00.580
I don't think every horse is created equal.

22:00.580 --> 22:07.540
I know that that's a major blaspheme to drop on this, which is basically an equestrian podcast at this point.

22:07.540 --> 22:09.940
At this point, it's basically an equestrian podcast.

22:09.940 --> 22:10.180
Yes.

22:12.020 --> 22:14.180
I think some are maybe half a horse power.

22:14.180 --> 22:14.740
Maybe their hearts-

22:14.740 --> 22:18.260
Can you imagine if you were a horse and you were less than one horse power?

22:18.260 --> 22:18.580
Yeah.

22:18.580 --> 22:20.980
That's gotta be like the most embarrassing thing.

22:20.980 --> 22:21.220
Yeah.

22:22.100 --> 22:27.380
Yeah, because it's like, oh, this card is just one horse power to pull, so it shouldn't be a problem.

22:27.380 --> 22:27.860
But you know-

22:27.860 --> 22:28.340
You got this.

22:28.340 --> 22:30.100
You've been inside your seven-eighths horse.

22:30.100 --> 22:30.660
I bet you-

22:30.660 --> 22:32.580
I'm gonna need help.

22:32.580 --> 22:35.700
I bet you Sea Biscuits was like 10 horse power.

22:36.500 --> 22:38.980
He had a heart the size of 10 horse hearts.

22:38.980 --> 22:39.460
Right.

22:39.460 --> 22:41.380
He actually had 10 horse hearts.

22:41.380 --> 22:43.140
That's why it was bulging out in the front.

22:43.140 --> 22:44.980
It was grotesque.

22:44.980 --> 22:46.340
Why is that horse so lumpy?

22:46.340 --> 22:47.700
It was like the final scene in Akira.

22:47.700 --> 22:47.700
It was terrible.

22:47.700 --> 22:48.980
He was just coming out of his-

22:48.980 --> 22:49.940
It was a nightmare.

22:49.940 --> 22:51.380
Yeah, it was a nightmare.

22:51.380 --> 22:52.020
It was terrible.

22:52.020 --> 22:57.380
It was like a video game boss, just hearts pulsating out of his stomach.

22:57.380 --> 23:00.740
And when he died, all of his hearts exploded at once and turned him inside out.

23:00.740 --> 23:01.060
Yeah.

23:01.060 --> 23:01.860
Oh, God.

23:02.420 --> 23:03.460
It was horrible.

23:03.460 --> 23:04.180
And delicious.

23:04.180 --> 23:10.580
You guys ever seen that movie, The Cell, when the glass stuff drops on it and cuts it into 20 pieces?

23:11.780 --> 23:12.340
Yeah.

23:12.340 --> 23:16.180
I'm just saying that's a real bad way for a horse to go out that happened in a movie.

23:17.860 --> 23:19.940
Yeah, I don't think that's ever really happened before.

23:19.940 --> 23:24.740
The best way for a horse to die is to die peacefully in its bed at the ripe old age of 36,

23:24.740 --> 23:27.460
smoking a pipe surrounded by all those great grand horses.

23:28.420 --> 23:32.500
And he's had the last rites delivered to him by a horse preacher.

23:33.140 --> 23:35.940
What's the option for defensive horses?

23:35.940 --> 23:37.460
Because it doesn't seem like...

23:37.460 --> 23:40.020
It seems like you're going to get a lot of roughing the pasture there.

23:40.020 --> 23:44.180
Because you can't just tell a horse like, hey, he's already passed the ball, don't go after him.

23:44.180 --> 23:44.580
I think that-

23:44.580 --> 23:45.460
No kicking.

23:45.460 --> 23:47.860
I think, or trampling is more what I'm concerned about.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.220
That's more of a horse's forte.

23:50.500 --> 23:54.340
Man, God help you if you drink the Gatorade before the horse gets there.

23:54.340 --> 23:55.220
They will be livid.

23:55.220 --> 23:57.700
You have to just unscrew the top and let him get in there.

23:57.700 --> 23:58.820
Because he will get dehydrated.

23:58.820 --> 23:59.700
Guys, we fucked up.

23:59.700 --> 24:01.220
We dumped the oats on the coach.

24:02.100 --> 24:03.060
Everybody look out.

24:04.900 --> 24:08.100
These are my victory oats and you dumped them on the coach.

24:08.100 --> 24:09.460
I was going to eat them afterwards.

24:10.100 --> 24:11.220
He's got oat fever.

24:11.220 --> 24:12.260
Get out of the way.

24:12.260 --> 24:13.540
Alternate rule set.

24:13.540 --> 24:15.860
Instead of having one spot reserved for the horse,

24:15.860 --> 24:18.020
I think that you don't have a special horse spot,

24:18.020 --> 24:23.060
but you do have the option to switch out as many of your human players for horse players

24:23.060 --> 24:27.460
as you see fit, which would be fun for like, if you're the Denver Broncos,

24:27.460 --> 24:32.340
you could go with a very, very literal rendition of that name.

24:33.060 --> 24:35.380
Maybe you have an all horse team versus an all human team,

24:35.380 --> 24:38.580
and we finally fucking square that out, you know?

24:38.580 --> 24:40.020
Guys, here's the thing though.

24:40.900 --> 24:42.820
This has already been prepared for.

24:43.540 --> 24:44.100
Oh yeah?

24:44.100 --> 24:46.180
The fucking Budweiser Clydesdales.

24:46.180 --> 24:46.660
Oh shit.

24:46.660 --> 24:48.180
Oh, you're right.

24:48.180 --> 24:50.740
They've been out there playing ball for ages.

24:50.740 --> 24:53.620
They're like the Jackie Robinson of horses and football.

24:53.620 --> 24:55.700
And who's officiating the game?

24:55.700 --> 24:56.500
It's a zebra.

24:59.300 --> 25:02.100
Can you believe they still won't allow horses in the Hall of Fame?

25:02.100 --> 25:02.500
I know.

25:03.140 --> 25:06.820
Yeah, it's just because they're not people and they won't show up to the ceremonies

25:06.820 --> 25:08.340
and they don't live long enough to go.

25:08.980 --> 25:12.020
And it doesn't mean anything to them to be accoladed.

25:12.900 --> 25:15.060
There's really any number of reasons.

25:15.060 --> 25:16.900
When they put their bronze head in,

25:16.900 --> 25:19.380
they just have one generic one because who can tell the difference?

25:19.380 --> 25:20.420
Yeah, I don't know.

25:20.420 --> 25:21.700
It's all racist.

25:21.700 --> 25:22.580
I know, right?

25:22.580 --> 25:25.780
Well, and also their records aren't very good.

25:26.500 --> 25:32.020
You know what the longest catch, the longest reception for a horse wide receiver is?

25:32.020 --> 25:33.060
I'm going to say none.

25:33.060 --> 25:33.620
No yards.

25:33.620 --> 25:35.140
It's not, it can't, it's not even done.

25:35.140 --> 25:35.780
No, you can't.

25:35.780 --> 25:39.220
Not a physically possible catch at catching.

25:39.940 --> 25:47.780
There was Sticky Four Hoof Malone who played for I believe the Raiders in 1991, I want to say.

25:47.780 --> 25:48.980
I was in preschool.

25:48.980 --> 25:49.780
Yeah, in 91.

25:50.740 --> 25:52.660
So anyway, they would coat the horse in tar.

25:53.460 --> 25:54.260
Right.

25:54.260 --> 25:57.860
And just sort of throw it real hard and hope that it would adhere.

25:58.420 --> 26:02.340
And his defensive strategy, they'd set that tar on fire and it was fucking horrible.

26:02.340 --> 26:02.740
Yeah.

26:02.740 --> 26:07.140
And also that was the year of all of the dragging deaths.

26:07.140 --> 26:09.380
So that was a problem.

26:09.380 --> 26:11.380
They originally tried to use peanut butter,

26:11.380 --> 26:14.340
but he was literally devoured by the other horses within minutes.

26:14.340 --> 26:14.900
Yeah.

26:14.900 --> 26:17.300
It simply, it simply was not the same.

26:17.300 --> 26:19.140
Do you guys ever sometimes think like, oh man,

26:19.140 --> 26:23.380
I want to live in this world that we've created with our imagination together.

26:24.260 --> 26:28.340
There is nothing I find more repellent than the world of our creation.

26:29.220 --> 26:32.100
There's no place I would rather out there's, no.

26:32.100 --> 26:36.580
You don't want to watch a sport where horses just sort of crash into each other like waves against,

26:36.580 --> 26:40.820
like so many waves against the rocky shores of the Pacific Northwest.

26:41.540 --> 26:43.380
Of all the things to replace,

26:43.380 --> 26:46.740
I'd rather replace some members of Dave Matthews band with horses.

26:46.740 --> 26:49.620
Like that's the kind of, that's where I'd like to see them at.

26:49.620 --> 26:52.820
Cause you would look and like something about this band, it seems odd.

26:53.620 --> 26:55.860
I wonder how long it would take Dave Matthews to notice.

26:55.860 --> 26:56.420
Yeah.

26:56.420 --> 26:58.260
He would literally never notice.

26:59.300 --> 27:01.700
You really killed it, horse violin player.

27:01.700 --> 27:02.900
Wait a minute.

27:02.900 --> 27:06.340
If he hasn't noticed, if he hasn't noticed how his music sounds right now,

27:06.340 --> 27:07.780
I can't imagine he's going to notice.

27:07.780 --> 27:09.620
He keeps forgetting to put on real pants.

27:09.620 --> 27:10.420
That should be enough.

27:10.420 --> 27:10.900
Yeah.

27:10.900 --> 27:13.220
If that horse can play a bassoon, it's not going to be an issue.

27:14.260 --> 27:15.300
He doesn't like labels.

27:16.020 --> 27:16.900
I have a question for you guys.

27:16.900 --> 27:18.420
I've been thinking of it a lot lately.

27:18.420 --> 27:21.460
The fact is I'm recently divorced, 29 year old woman.

27:21.460 --> 27:24.900
As I begin to prepare myself for the dating world by focusing on my wonderful traits,

27:24.900 --> 27:28.740
I can't help but dread the idea of telling future suitors that I've been married before.

27:28.740 --> 27:31.940
My friend told me to refer to him as my first husband,

27:31.940 --> 27:33.380
but I'm not sure that's the right approach.

27:33.940 --> 27:37.620
How and when do I tell the men out there that I've already walked down the aisle?

27:37.620 --> 27:39.940
That's for hoping for a re-identification.

27:39.940 --> 27:41.140
Hoping for a re-I do.

27:43.060 --> 27:45.220
I would stay away from the phrase first husband.

27:45.220 --> 27:45.700
Yeah.

27:45.700 --> 27:45.940
Yeah.

27:45.940 --> 27:46.580
I don't like that.

27:46.580 --> 27:48.340
That sounds like you're praying mantis.

27:48.340 --> 27:52.420
Because what it sounds like to the person you say it to is, and I'm looking for a second.

27:52.420 --> 27:52.900
Yeah.

27:52.900 --> 27:53.300
Or-

27:53.300 --> 27:53.620
Yeah.

27:53.620 --> 27:54.260
There's nothing.

27:54.260 --> 27:57.140
You can't say previous, my previous husband.

27:57.140 --> 27:58.100
Oh, my last shit.

27:59.380 --> 28:01.940
Have you heard my last shit?

28:01.940 --> 28:04.660
You could say like the scrub I was with before.

28:04.660 --> 28:04.900
Yeah.

28:05.700 --> 28:05.940
Yeah.

28:06.980 --> 28:07.860
That might be good.

28:07.860 --> 28:12.020
You really got to vilify, you really got to vilify your previous suitor.

28:13.620 --> 28:13.780
Yeah.

28:13.780 --> 28:17.620
You don't want this guy to ever question like, who's the better husband?

28:17.620 --> 28:18.820
Or where did I go wrong?

28:18.820 --> 28:22.180
Or just roll up at first day be like, it was all my fault.

28:22.180 --> 28:22.420
Yeah.

28:23.060 --> 28:23.460
Oh, no.

28:23.460 --> 28:23.940
Wait a minute.

28:23.940 --> 28:24.420
That doesn't-

28:25.060 --> 28:26.100
What would that help?

28:26.100 --> 28:27.300
What would that fix exactly?

28:27.300 --> 28:29.220
Just lower the expectations.

28:30.260 --> 28:31.460
I don't- Okay.

28:32.020 --> 28:36.260
Once the guy's into you, I'm not sure that would be enough to dissuade you from-

28:36.260 --> 28:37.060
Get rid of it, right?

28:37.060 --> 28:40.740
Now, when you say he's into her, yeah.

28:40.740 --> 28:42.260
You know what I mean?

28:42.260 --> 28:43.060
I don't mean fit.

28:43.060 --> 28:43.300
I don't-

28:46.500 --> 28:47.940
I'm not clear on what you're talking about.

28:51.940 --> 28:55.460
Though that may be a good moment to tell the truth.

28:55.460 --> 28:55.700
Yeah.

28:55.700 --> 28:56.260
Guess what?

28:57.540 --> 29:00.180
Hey, I know you're busy trying to cram, but-

29:01.780 --> 29:03.700
Let me just drop some truth on you right quick.

29:03.700 --> 29:09.060
I don't think that it- I really don't think this would be a huge deal on one the other, right?

29:09.060 --> 29:11.220
No, it's not like 1932 anymore.

29:11.220 --> 29:12.340
Like, who cares?

29:12.340 --> 29:13.300
Yeah, everybody-

29:14.100 --> 29:15.700
This is a good gate for you.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.180
This is a good bar.

29:18.180 --> 29:21.380
It's like a built-in bar that all of your future suitors have to clear.

29:21.380 --> 29:24.660
Because if they hear you say, I've been married before, and they're not like

29:25.460 --> 29:28.580
mature enough to handle that information, guess what?

29:29.300 --> 29:32.740
By the time you're like 40, everybody's been married before, basically.

29:32.740 --> 29:34.420
And half of them didn't work out.

29:34.420 --> 29:35.860
So, you're not-

29:35.860 --> 29:38.420
Right, and first marriages never work out.

29:38.420 --> 29:38.900
Yeah.

29:38.900 --> 29:40.020
Everybody knows that.

29:40.020 --> 29:40.740
Hi, sweetie.

29:40.740 --> 29:41.380
I'm just kidding.

29:42.260 --> 29:43.540
I'm just kidding, baby.

29:44.740 --> 29:45.300
Sorry.

29:46.500 --> 29:48.340
I really don't think it'll be-

29:49.060 --> 29:50.420
But now, when do you-

29:50.420 --> 29:51.460
When do you-

29:52.500 --> 29:54.660
I think you gotta go a few dates in before you drop that.

29:54.660 --> 29:55.300
Oh, definitely.

29:55.300 --> 29:55.800
No.

29:56.900 --> 29:57.620
I think you lead with-

29:57.620 --> 29:59.300
Unless it comes up organically.

30:00.100 --> 30:01.540
I think you lead with it.

30:01.540 --> 30:02.820
I think you lead with it.

30:03.380 --> 30:05.060
And I think you can organically do it.

30:05.060 --> 30:05.860
Like, hey, Mark.

30:05.860 --> 30:06.660
Oh, I mean Brian.

30:06.660 --> 30:07.060
Sorry.

30:07.060 --> 30:08.820
Mark was my husband I had once.

30:09.780 --> 30:13.860
No, I mean like if they ask, like if they're like, so have you ever been married before?

30:13.860 --> 30:16.500
Because as you said, in this day and age, it's not uncommon.

30:17.700 --> 30:18.740
Why would you ask that?

30:19.460 --> 30:19.960
Ever.

30:20.500 --> 30:23.060
If you're just dating somebody, you're not gonna mention marriage, period.

30:23.060 --> 30:27.220
But you don't think that like prior relationships come up when you're getting to know someone?

30:27.220 --> 30:28.100
Getting to know someone.

30:28.100 --> 30:31.780
I'm saying like three dates and not before.

30:31.780 --> 30:33.220
You do it right before you pork.

30:34.180 --> 30:35.140
Well, see, but this is-

30:35.140 --> 30:36.260
But this is my question.

30:36.260 --> 30:41.300
Like, for reals, can you bring it up in a way that you are not biasing the decision

30:41.300 --> 30:42.820
by being like, hey, we need to talk.

30:43.380 --> 30:44.900
I have to tell you, I was married before.

30:44.900 --> 30:49.300
I looked up your records at the library and I have a sneaking suspicion that you were once

30:50.260 --> 30:52.020
legally entangled with a Mark.

30:53.140 --> 30:56.340
No, I'm saying that from this, our question askers point of view,

30:56.340 --> 30:59.860
like how does she bring it up casually without making it a big deal?

30:59.860 --> 31:00.740
Because it's not.

31:00.740 --> 31:04.740
But I worry that by bringing it up wrong, you could make it a big deal.

31:04.740 --> 31:08.660
If it's your first date after you've been divorced, it's a big deal, dog.

31:08.660 --> 31:09.780
Like, it is.

31:09.780 --> 31:12.500
And you just gotta just ram right through it and get through it.

31:12.500 --> 31:17.540
And then if they say, oh, I'm not, I can't handle that, then they just did you the service

31:17.540 --> 31:22.420
of bowing out, of bowing out, you know, getting, taking themselves out.

31:22.420 --> 31:23.620
Because they're not ready for you.

31:23.620 --> 31:24.900
They're not ready for your heat.

31:24.900 --> 31:28.980
And another good thing is when the guy asks you how long have you been divorced,

31:28.980 --> 31:29.860
oh, look at your watch.

31:31.220 --> 31:31.780
Don't love that.

31:31.780 --> 31:32.340
What day is it?

31:32.340 --> 31:32.900
It's gonna be a good gag.

31:35.300 --> 31:37.940
Hold on, is this seven o'clock AM or PM?

31:38.980 --> 31:42.020
I can't tell because I find it really hard to focus right now.

31:42.020 --> 31:42.900
I just got divorced.

31:46.740 --> 31:50.260
Guys, girls, let the past go.

31:50.260 --> 31:57.380
If you're dating somebody, why does it even cross your mind how they spent the days before

31:57.380 --> 31:58.100
your time together?

31:58.100 --> 32:00.180
How is it different from, like, having ex-boyfriends?

32:00.180 --> 32:02.740
Now, I know that it is, but I'm just saying, why should it be?

32:04.180 --> 32:04.740
You know?

32:04.740 --> 32:07.860
Like, you were in a relationship before the relationship ended.

32:07.860 --> 32:09.700
Like, everyone has that story.

32:09.700 --> 32:12.900
I would also, but like, aren't you gonna be curious as to why it didn't work?

32:12.900 --> 32:17.780
I mean, if you're the guy, you know, dating a girl who got divorced,

32:17.780 --> 32:21.620
like, how much prying into that is, like, acceptable?

32:22.340 --> 32:27.380
Oh, no, I think you totally get to ask, but not for, like, six dates.

32:28.660 --> 32:32.980
You think six dates before you're allowed to say, like, ah, where did it go wrong?

32:32.980 --> 32:34.900
Yeah, so, like, what happened?

32:35.860 --> 32:36.580
Do you want to talk about it?

32:36.580 --> 32:40.180
And then you think, like, nine dates, you can start making sort of snide remarks.

32:40.180 --> 32:46.820
Like, oh, I bet this is why Mark got in his Jetta and just went away.

32:46.820 --> 32:50.020
And then, like, 12 dates and you're lonely again.

32:50.820 --> 32:52.500
Yeah, we had a good run, though.

32:52.500 --> 32:59.140
And maybe 15 dates, you just get a little drunk on Mountain Dude,

32:59.140 --> 33:02.980
and you call both Mark and Brian, and you put them on a three-way call,

33:02.980 --> 33:05.060
and you just give them both a piece of your mind.

33:05.060 --> 33:06.580
And you suggest a three-way.

33:06.580 --> 33:09.940
And then maybe 50 first dates with Adam Sandler.

33:11.220 --> 33:14.820
Brian, tell Mark what you're doing different from what Mark did,

33:14.820 --> 33:17.780
because Mark's always asking, where did he go wrong?

33:17.780 --> 33:18.740
I like Brian better.

33:18.740 --> 33:21.460
So, Brian, tell Mark what you're doing that's so much better.

33:21.460 --> 33:24.500
I'm just going to cut out the middleman and let you two hash it out

33:24.500 --> 33:26.660
so that he can be better than you ever were.

33:26.660 --> 33:28.420
Yeah, fight for my honor.

33:29.700 --> 33:31.140
Will you two fist fight each other?

33:33.300 --> 33:34.820
I used to be married.

33:35.780 --> 33:36.900
Oh, yeah, what happened?

33:36.900 --> 33:39.940
Well, I'm going to trick you into killing my husband.

33:39.940 --> 33:42.900
So, I mean, my tense is optimistic.

33:42.900 --> 33:44.340
Let's put it that way.

33:44.340 --> 33:49.300
I used to have a husband, and if you want to get lucky tonight,

33:49.300 --> 33:52.100
I'm going to need you to go to his house and burn it down or something.

33:52.100 --> 33:53.460
Just make it look like an accident.

33:53.460 --> 33:54.740
I really want this to work between us.

33:54.740 --> 33:55.700
Are you a Sagittarius?

33:55.700 --> 33:57.460
You seem like a Sagittarius.

33:57.460 --> 33:58.020
This is great.

33:58.020 --> 33:59.300
This is great bisque.

33:59.300 --> 34:00.580
Thanks for taking me to Fizzoli's.

34:02.180 --> 34:04.180
Have you guys had Fizzoli's new bisque?

34:04.180 --> 34:05.540
Yeah, the ravioli bisque.

34:06.580 --> 34:07.860
So, do you have a new bisque?

34:07.860 --> 34:15.140
It's so great, you just dip that stupid, wet, stinky ass bread up in it,

34:15.140 --> 34:18.900
and then you soak it, you wring it out like a squeegee, right in your mouth.

34:18.900 --> 34:20.100
And then you propose murder.

34:20.100 --> 34:24.660
And then you just say you want, if something were to happen to Brian,

34:24.660 --> 34:28.500
wouldn't be completely unaroused.

34:28.500 --> 34:29.940
Just put it that way.

34:31.060 --> 34:33.620
I would not become more flaccid inside,

34:33.620 --> 34:36.900
or whatever the female equivalent of flaccidity is.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.900
My vagina is fully erect right now.

34:38.900 --> 34:41.220
Griffin, female arousal is a myth.

34:41.220 --> 34:42.260
Let's go to the money zone.

34:53.940 --> 34:55.460
Who's this message for?

34:55.460 --> 34:56.900
Well, Michael Williams.

34:56.900 --> 34:58.100
So glad you asked, Griffin.

34:59.540 --> 35:00.500
Who's it from?

35:00.500 --> 35:01.940
Well, Sarah Bags.

35:02.580 --> 35:05.380
She says, happy birthday to my awesome fiancee,

35:05.380 --> 35:08.260
who's turning the big 3-0 on September 9th.

35:08.260 --> 35:09.140
Oops.

35:09.140 --> 35:10.580
He is the greatest guy ever.

35:11.620 --> 35:12.660
Sorry, I missed it.

35:12.660 --> 35:15.380
He's the greatest guy ever, and he loves my bim-bam-bam,

35:15.380 --> 35:20.420
which he introduced to me, so on my work commute wouldn't suck.

35:20.420 --> 35:25.780
So, that's from Sarah to Michael, Big Mike, to his friends and co-workers.

35:25.780 --> 35:26.420
Captain Mike.

35:26.980 --> 35:28.660
Captain Mike, they call him.

35:28.660 --> 35:32.580
Mike Rofone, they call him sometimes.

35:32.580 --> 35:33.540
Big Willy.

35:33.540 --> 35:33.780
Mike.

35:33.780 --> 35:34.820
Big Willy style.

35:34.820 --> 35:37.300
Because his last name is Williams.

35:37.300 --> 35:38.660
Michael Williams.

35:38.660 --> 35:39.380
Mike the Bike.

35:39.940 --> 35:41.620
Mike the Bike, it's his big day.

35:42.420 --> 35:43.060
Hey.

35:43.060 --> 35:43.780
Boss Cock.

35:44.820 --> 35:46.740
Boss Cock Michael Williams.

35:48.260 --> 35:51.060
I just gave that dude a nickname that he's gonna have forever.

35:52.660 --> 35:56.340
So, Michael, you have any nicknames around the office?

35:56.340 --> 35:58.340
I have one I don't really like to talk about.

35:58.340 --> 35:59.540
An internet gave it to me.

36:00.420 --> 36:02.500
An internet gave it to me.

36:02.500 --> 36:05.380
It is Boss Cock.

36:05.380 --> 36:06.180
Like Boss Hog?

36:06.180 --> 36:06.980
Yeah, I guess.

36:07.700 --> 36:09.780
Yeah, I guess that's what they were going for.

36:09.780 --> 36:10.900
It wasn't a good episode.

36:10.900 --> 36:13.300
The internet was a little hung over when he said it.

36:13.300 --> 36:14.900
So, it probably made sense.

36:16.580 --> 36:19.540
One third of the internet took some Benadryl before the show

36:19.540 --> 36:20.900
because his allergies flared up.

36:21.540 --> 36:23.940
So, he was a little out of it when he said Boss Cock, I think.

36:26.180 --> 36:27.700
Hey, do you guys love beats?

36:28.420 --> 36:29.140
All the beats.

36:29.140 --> 36:30.180
Rap and beats?

36:30.180 --> 36:33.700
Wait, B-E-E-T-S or B-E-E-L-A?

36:33.700 --> 36:35.380
No, not like Killer Tofu.

36:35.380 --> 36:36.740
I mean like rap and beats.

36:36.740 --> 36:39.780
B-E-E-E-E-E-E-T-S.

36:39.780 --> 36:40.580
Beats!

36:40.580 --> 36:47.380
I want to tell you guys about the debut mixtape from our boy, J-Phonic.

36:47.380 --> 36:49.220
Oh, shit.

36:49.220 --> 36:52.180
Chrono-grammaticist, the J-Phonic mixtape.

36:52.740 --> 36:58.420
You can get that for free at J-Phonic.

36:58.420 --> 37:00.260
What a deal.

37:00.260 --> 37:00.740
I know.

37:00.740 --> 37:04.660
At J-P-H-O-N-I-C mixtape dot com.

37:04.660 --> 37:07.220
That's J-Phonic mixtape dot com.

37:07.220 --> 37:09.620
You can get it for free.

37:09.620 --> 37:12.420
He's an alternative hip hop artist and friend of the show.

37:12.420 --> 37:18.500
It's his debut album and it's not only ultra dope, but it's also totally completely free.

37:18.500 --> 37:23.620
It's got some nerdy songs, got some West Coast flavor, I think, is in there.

37:25.620 --> 37:27.140
It's completely sugar free.

37:27.140 --> 37:27.780
Free.

37:27.780 --> 37:39.860
And I've heard J-Phonic on the MIC, not to get me confused with the M-I-C-H-A-E-L-B-O-S-S-C-O-C-K-W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S.

37:39.860 --> 37:42.180
That's Michael Boscock Williams you're thinking of.

37:42.180 --> 37:44.740
I'm talking about the MIC that you rap into.

37:44.740 --> 37:45.300
Correct.

37:45.300 --> 37:51.140
But when he puts sounds from his mouth into that thing and they go through the electronics

37:51.140 --> 37:53.220
and come into my ears, I like it.

37:53.220 --> 37:54.180
I like what happens.

37:54.180 --> 38:00.260
Um, if you want to experience some of Bim Bam related J-Phonic heat, remember he did

38:00.260 --> 38:03.140
like two intros for us back in the day.

38:03.860 --> 38:04.500
Do you remember this?

38:04.500 --> 38:05.460
Yeah, back in the Dizzy.

38:05.460 --> 38:06.900
Yes, yes I do.

38:06.900 --> 38:08.180
He did at least one outro.

38:08.180 --> 38:10.580
I can't remember the episodes, but he's-

38:10.580 --> 38:12.180
Go back and listen to all of them and find it.

38:12.180 --> 38:18.500
Yeah, it's only, I'm not gonna lie, it's gonna take 120 hours, but I think it's worth it.

38:20.740 --> 38:21.780
Happy birthday, Jordan.

38:21.780 --> 38:23.460
Happy birthday.

38:23.460 --> 38:25.860
Happy birthday, J-Phonic.

38:26.980 --> 38:28.500
Oh, are we not allowed to unmask?

38:28.500 --> 38:29.860
Did I just like unmask the luchador?

38:29.860 --> 38:31.380
He just like unmasked him, yeah.

38:32.820 --> 38:35.060
Go to jphonicmixtape.com.

38:35.060 --> 38:37.780
Might as well tell everyone that Deadmau5's real name is Francis.

38:39.380 --> 38:41.780
Francis, what are you doing on that stage?

38:43.540 --> 38:45.540
Ma, I'm trying to make some beats.

38:46.340 --> 38:47.540
That's not music.

38:47.540 --> 38:50.100
I, whatever happened to Rudy Valli?

38:50.100 --> 38:51.780
Ma, go home.

38:53.380 --> 38:56.900
You look like a big old cyborg Mickey Mouse or something up there.

38:56.900 --> 38:57.780
What are you doing?

38:58.660 --> 39:00.420
Ma, I told you I'm working.

39:02.420 --> 39:03.460
That ain't a job.

39:03.460 --> 39:06.980
Get back to the diner and help your father clean up the hamburger slop.

39:07.860 --> 39:10.500
He's not well and we're all waiting for the drop.

39:11.140 --> 39:11.940
Give it to us.

39:11.940 --> 39:13.540
Give us that high beat.

39:13.540 --> 39:14.820
That stinky drop.

39:16.180 --> 39:18.580
Give us that fat nasty bass.

39:18.580 --> 39:20.260
We're all waiting for it.

39:20.260 --> 39:24.180
We all got, your grandpa's gonna die before you drop that fat bass on us.

39:28.900 --> 39:33.780
Your cousin Skrillex would never make us wait this long for a fat nasty drop.

39:45.940 --> 39:46.980
Oh, Jesus.

39:46.980 --> 39:49.620
Francis, my high is peaking.

39:50.260 --> 39:51.460
I'm about to come down.

39:52.100 --> 39:53.700
I got my hands in the air.

39:53.700 --> 39:54.260
I'm ready.

39:55.060 --> 39:55.540
Drop it.

39:56.900 --> 39:57.940
Oh God.

39:57.940 --> 40:00.660
Your father worked all day to synthesize this X.

40:04.820 --> 40:08.340
My neon glow bracelets are losing the luminosity, Francis.

40:08.340 --> 40:17.940
Francis, they're closing the JCC at 7 PM.

40:17.940 --> 40:19.380
All these people have to get out.

40:19.380 --> 40:20.260
Just drop it.

40:21.220 --> 40:22.100
Drop the beat.

40:30.900 --> 40:32.980
So do you like to stick things in your penis?

40:34.420 --> 40:35.940
How's your boss cock doing?

40:35.940 --> 40:38.500
How's your boss cock doing, because boy howdy.

40:38.500 --> 40:39.620
Do I have a site for you?

40:39.620 --> 40:41.380
It's ExtremeRestraints.com.

40:41.380 --> 40:43.940
To be fair, it also caters to middle management cocks.

40:44.500 --> 40:49.780
Yeah, whatever kind of equipment you're working with down there, it has got you under control.

40:51.140 --> 40:55.780
If you like enema supplies, you want to get everything working out down there,

40:55.780 --> 40:57.220
is that part of your play?

40:57.220 --> 40:58.420
They've got it for you.

40:58.420 --> 41:03.060
Fetish clothing, you want to wrap yourself up in a latex or something?

41:03.620 --> 41:04.340
You can do that.

41:04.340 --> 41:08.660
They've got sexy lingerie too for the ladies, or the men.

41:08.660 --> 41:09.220
Who cares?

41:09.780 --> 41:11.700
Fucking machines, they've got them.

41:11.700 --> 41:13.300
We should've got a dick on a big ball.

41:14.420 --> 41:14.980
God bless.

41:14.980 --> 41:15.780
They've got everything.

41:15.780 --> 41:22.900
I love how the more we do work with our advertising partners at Extreme Restraints,

41:22.900 --> 41:27.540
the more sort of laissez-faire approach to fucking we've begun to adopt.

41:28.420 --> 41:30.260
What do you just put that in?

41:30.260 --> 41:31.620
What do you just do it?

41:31.620 --> 41:34.420
What do you just do it? I don't give a fuck.

41:34.420 --> 41:41.380
Yeah, it has reinvented really my ideas of the norm.

41:41.380 --> 41:43.700
I literally do not exist anymore.

41:43.700 --> 41:44.900
And you know what?

41:46.180 --> 41:48.420
You should open yourself up to some new stuff.

41:48.420 --> 41:49.140
Why not?

41:49.140 --> 41:49.700
Literally.

41:51.060 --> 41:54.900
Literally, open up your orifice and put something new in there.

41:54.900 --> 41:56.180
I'm not joking, you guys.

41:56.180 --> 41:58.820
Every time I go to ExtremeRestraints.com, it strikes me a lot.

41:58.820 --> 42:02.500
It strikes you over and over again because that's the only way you can finish.

42:02.500 --> 42:03.460
That's true.

42:03.460 --> 42:08.420
I also imagine that working there is like a sex toy Willy Wonka shop.

42:08.420 --> 42:09.940
Oh, man.

42:09.940 --> 42:12.900
Like the world of pure imagination.

42:12.900 --> 42:14.020
Come on, children.

42:14.020 --> 42:16.900
I'm just saying that after a while-

42:16.900 --> 42:17.860
I've chosen six of you.

42:17.860 --> 42:23.060
It's gotta not be so shocking that there's a chocolate river and some Oompa Loompas.

42:23.060 --> 42:24.580
Ew, what's in there?

42:24.580 --> 42:25.940
It's getting weird.

42:25.940 --> 42:28.980
Now it's getting weird.

42:28.980 --> 42:30.420
It started weird.

42:30.420 --> 42:31.540
It started weird?

42:31.540 --> 42:36.660
If you have the coupon code MIDDLEST, you can save 20% M-I-D-D-L-E-S-T.

42:36.660 --> 42:38.100
You can save 20% there.

42:38.100 --> 42:39.060
It's all discreet.

42:41.460 --> 42:43.620
And try something new.

42:43.620 --> 42:48.260
I'm willing to bet there's something there that will knock your socks off.

42:49.380 --> 42:50.740
Yeah, they have the sock knocker offer.

42:51.540 --> 42:53.140
And the cock socks are knocks are offer.

42:53.140 --> 42:56.420
Did you say knock your cocks off, because that may be a little too extreme.

42:56.420 --> 42:57.620
Get your rocks off.

42:57.620 --> 42:59.220
Get your rocks off by cutting your cock off.

42:59.220 --> 43:02.420
Do they have a sister site called Extreme Extreme Restraints?

43:02.980 --> 43:03.620
Or just possibly-

43:03.620 --> 43:05.220
They do have mild boring restraints.

43:05.220 --> 43:07.540
Fucking seriously, guys, no joke.

43:08.660 --> 43:11.140
These restraints are pretty goddamn extreme.

43:11.140 --> 43:16.820
If you go to boring restraints, you can tie yourself up with wet spaghetti, tissue paper.

43:17.460 --> 43:18.100
Promises.

43:18.100 --> 43:22.980
And then at Extreme Extreme Restraints, a man will come to your house and beat you to death.

43:25.780 --> 43:26.180
That site-

43:26.180 --> 43:28.740
So find the happy medium at ExtremeRestraints.com.

43:28.740 --> 43:36.020
Extreme Extreme Restraints, you can find it at AbandonAllHopeYeeHooEnterHere.com, oh,.net.

43:36.020 --> 43:37.380
They didn't secure the.com rights.

43:38.580 --> 43:39.540
What's your safe word?

43:40.100 --> 43:40.500
I don't know.

43:40.500 --> 43:41.140
They don't know.

43:41.140 --> 43:41.780
They don't have those.

43:41.780 --> 43:43.700
Yeah, they've got danger words.

43:43.700 --> 43:48.900
You just say it when you just want the pain to be over.

43:48.900 --> 43:51.540
Dear brothers McElroy, help.

43:52.180 --> 43:53.780
A few months ago, I started dating this girl.

43:53.780 --> 43:56.980
She's cute and funny, but I'm just not feeling it anymore.

43:56.980 --> 43:58.020
So I think it's time to end it.

43:58.740 --> 44:01.780
We're not gonna do it for you, if that's what you're building up to.

44:01.780 --> 44:02.740
So let me cut you off there.

44:03.540 --> 44:08.980
My birthday's coming up this weekend, and she had been executing this elaborate plot of telling me

44:08.980 --> 44:11.540
one thing she likes about me each day until my birthday.

44:11.540 --> 44:12.180
Oh, man.

44:12.180 --> 44:14.980
Oh, you really had, you couldn't keep this to yourself.

44:14.980 --> 44:17.060
You had to dump this on us and all of our listeners.

44:17.060 --> 44:18.100
Thank you.

44:18.100 --> 44:19.700
Culminating in some surprise.

44:20.420 --> 44:24.340
I don't know if it's better to end it now or wiser to wait.

44:24.340 --> 44:25.300
Help me out here.

44:26.100 --> 44:27.780
Confusion in Kansas.

44:27.780 --> 44:29.860
You've got a surprise coming your way.

44:30.420 --> 44:30.980
So do you.

44:30.980 --> 44:35.460
You've got a, I think that's the answer.

44:35.460 --> 44:40.980
Now every day tell her something you don't like about her and build up to a surprise of your own.

44:40.980 --> 44:46.340
I haven't been surprised by anything in probably 14 years.

44:47.540 --> 44:50.900
Probably since I got a PlayStation for Christmas, and I didn't think I was gonna get one.

44:52.020 --> 44:57.460
So to have a genuine surprise in your life, you gotta play that out.

44:58.500 --> 45:01.140
Yeah, it's a bad, cause what if she will never tell you?

45:01.700 --> 45:03.140
And then I'll just haunt you forever.

45:03.140 --> 45:04.260
Like, so what was it?

45:04.260 --> 45:06.740
Oh, I can't say.

45:06.740 --> 45:07.700
It'd be too hard.

45:07.700 --> 45:14.980
But what if the surprise is like, I got your name tattooed on me or like, I bought you this car.

45:16.260 --> 45:16.660
Well, that's.

45:17.620 --> 45:19.540
No, that one doesn't bother you as much.

45:19.540 --> 45:20.580
Not so much.

45:22.820 --> 45:25.220
This is what we call in the biz a bad beat.

45:25.860 --> 45:33.700
And if you end it now, it's just gonna be rough.

45:33.700 --> 45:34.020
Yeah.

45:34.020 --> 45:39.220
And it's not gonna be, I mean, it's gonna be bad, but I don't think it makes you the bad guy.

45:39.220 --> 45:40.500
Yeah, don't push the river here.

45:40.500 --> 45:42.820
You gotta get out if you got the opportunity.

45:43.540 --> 45:44.340
You gotta fold.

45:44.340 --> 45:45.620
You gotta fold them.

45:45.620 --> 45:46.180
And don't chase them.

45:46.180 --> 45:47.380
You gotta know when to hold them.

45:47.380 --> 45:48.260
Don't chase that rainbow.

45:48.260 --> 45:51.860
Travis, if you finish that phrase, I don't know what I'll do.

45:54.100 --> 45:56.100
Know when to walk.

45:56.100 --> 45:57.140
I'm trying to stop.

45:57.140 --> 45:57.940
Yeah, it's real easy.

45:59.380 --> 46:01.620
Can I also just give another suggestion?

46:01.620 --> 46:06.020
And it's actually more of an exclamation or perhaps an interrogative.

46:06.020 --> 46:07.380
Why are you breaking up with this girl?

46:07.380 --> 46:08.660
She sounds super sweet.

46:09.380 --> 46:10.500
Yeah, she sounds really sweet.

46:10.500 --> 46:12.260
It sounds like a real nice thing that she's doing.

46:13.300 --> 46:16.020
Yeah, I think she's probably pretty great.

46:16.020 --> 46:17.380
I would stick with it.

46:17.380 --> 46:18.820
At least so you find out what the surprise is.

46:18.820 --> 46:22.820
And if the surprise sucks, end it because of that and let her know that's why.

46:23.540 --> 46:26.340
Sometimes, listen, I'll break it down for you.

46:26.340 --> 46:32.260
Sometimes, if you're with somebody for long enough, even if you don't like them at first

46:32.260 --> 46:37.700
and you spend a lot of time with them, then eventually down the road, you might find that

46:37.700 --> 46:38.420
you care about them.

46:38.420 --> 46:42.100
Or at least that's what I keep telling my wife.

46:42.100 --> 46:43.860
Oh, Justin.

46:43.860 --> 46:46.420
I'm hoping that things are going to show.

46:50.740 --> 46:51.780
Bringing it down.

46:51.780 --> 46:53.380
We were having some goofs.

46:53.380 --> 46:56.500
We were making some laughs, and now they're dead.

46:58.820 --> 47:03.780
Hey, can we, every time we do an episode, can we say one nice thing about each other?

47:04.820 --> 47:05.780
Just something sweet.

47:05.780 --> 47:08.820
Justin, your ceviche is the best ceviche I've had.

47:08.820 --> 47:12.900
And Travis, the muscles in your hands are really big.

47:13.700 --> 47:14.020
Thank you.

47:14.020 --> 47:15.620
I've never made ceviche for you.

47:16.340 --> 47:18.020
I don't know why you would say things like that.

47:18.020 --> 47:19.380
You have made ceviche for me before.

47:19.380 --> 47:19.940
It's really good.

47:19.940 --> 47:20.580
I have not.

47:20.580 --> 47:21.460
I have not made ceviche for you before.

47:21.460 --> 47:24.020
You made me ceviche shrimp once.

47:24.020 --> 47:26.180
I did not make you ceviche shrimp once, but thank you.

47:26.180 --> 47:28.420
You made, I fucking ate ceviche.

47:28.420 --> 47:31.140
Were those just raw shrimp I was eating out of your refrigerator?

47:31.940 --> 47:34.260
Did I tell you guys about the text that I got from dad?

47:34.980 --> 47:38.180
I got a text from dad, this was like three weeks ago.

47:38.180 --> 47:41.380
It was maybe 8 p.m. on a Saturday night.

47:41.380 --> 47:46.820
And I get a text from our shared dad that says, try ceviche.

47:48.260 --> 47:50.660
Just apropos of nothing.

47:50.660 --> 47:54.180
Matt, Clint's just like, hey, try ceviche.

47:54.180 --> 47:54.740
All right, dad.

47:57.220 --> 47:57.780
Like now?

47:57.780 --> 47:58.980
I was thinking of putting it off.

47:58.980 --> 48:00.260
I was thinking of putting it off.

48:00.260 --> 48:01.780
This has gone far enough.

48:01.780 --> 48:02.740
Try ceviche.

48:02.740 --> 48:07.940
Do you think our dad, do you think he confused like his text message app and his notes app?

48:07.940 --> 48:09.460
He's like, I got to send this.

48:09.460 --> 48:10.260
I'm going to forget this.

48:10.260 --> 48:11.380
Got to put it in the cloud.

48:12.580 --> 48:13.460
Oh, fuck.

48:14.500 --> 48:15.140
That's good.

48:16.580 --> 48:17.220
Oh, man.

48:17.220 --> 48:24.420
And just so you guys know, of course, our listening audience won't be able to enjoy this.

48:24.420 --> 48:26.340
But just so you guys know, I'm not fucking with you.

48:26.340 --> 48:30.980
I'm going to send you a screen cap that I just took.

48:32.020 --> 48:34.340
Here are the things that my dad texted me about.

48:35.620 --> 48:39.860
One, premiere dates for shows that we both enjoy.

48:39.860 --> 48:41.300
This can be helpful sometimes.

48:41.300 --> 48:42.740
So I appreciate that.

48:42.740 --> 48:45.140
Two, and I don't know if you guys get these too.

48:45.140 --> 48:46.980
I don't know if you guys are on this mailing list.

48:46.980 --> 48:52.740
But when somebody dies, like a celebrity dies, I always get a text message from dad.

48:52.740 --> 48:57.940
And it's nice that he's almost the emotional pace car for these kinds of things.

48:57.940 --> 49:04.900
Because he lets you know that, yes, this person did just die.

49:04.900 --> 49:08.020
But it's cool to drop a goof in here.

49:08.020 --> 49:12.580
For instance, August 20, 2012, and somewhere Fang is crying.

49:12.580 --> 49:13.060
What was that?

49:13.060 --> 49:18.740
Uh-huh, that was a reference to, I think, Carol Channing dying, maybe.

49:19.460 --> 49:20.340
Phyllis Diller dying.

49:21.220 --> 49:23.860
It was a reference to Carol Channing killing Phyllis Diller.

49:25.620 --> 49:27.780
Explain to me about hashtags on Twitter.

49:30.340 --> 49:31.060
Oh, how about this?

49:31.060 --> 49:32.500
Oh, this is a classic Jim.

49:32.500 --> 49:33.540
He's moving on up.

49:35.380 --> 49:36.660
That was when Mr. Jefferson died.

49:36.660 --> 49:38.180
Priceless, priceless.

49:38.180 --> 49:38.680
Priceless.

49:39.460 --> 49:40.180
So good.

49:40.180 --> 49:42.180
Dad doesn't text me.

49:42.180 --> 49:48.820
It must be lovely to have a close relationship with your father.

49:48.820 --> 49:50.020
Actually, I got a text about that.

49:50.020 --> 49:51.780
Sad I'm not texting Travis anymore.

49:51.780 --> 49:53.940
He just keeps texting me and calling me Travis Snow.

49:54.500 --> 49:55.700
And I don't know why.

49:55.700 --> 49:57.540
July 3, 2012.

49:57.540 --> 50:00.180
I hope Aunt B had him a big old pie waiting.

50:00.180 --> 50:01.700
That's when Andy Griffith died.

50:01.700 --> 50:03.380
I got that one on August 10.

50:03.380 --> 50:05.300
Big thumbs up on new pizza place.

50:07.060 --> 50:08.660
That's not somebody dying.

50:08.660 --> 50:10.340
No, but it was really random.

50:10.340 --> 50:12.980
We've not spoken about a pizza place prior to that.

50:12.980 --> 50:14.980
I don't even know what pizza place he was talking about.

50:15.700 --> 50:16.980
Here's here's another one.

50:16.980 --> 50:20.020
And this is I do not know where he was when he said this.

50:20.020 --> 50:21.380
He was going on vacation.

50:21.380 --> 50:23.860
But this is the exact text I got from our dad.

50:24.500 --> 50:27.380
We finally got here and Richard Gere can blow me.

50:30.020 --> 50:32.100
That was from his shitty vacation in Rodin.

50:33.620 --> 50:34.660
How about this, Jim?

50:34.660 --> 50:36.020
Oh, can we do this every week?

50:36.020 --> 50:37.220
This is so great.

50:37.220 --> 50:39.460
French French steward on community.

50:39.460 --> 50:40.020
Brilliant.

50:42.580 --> 50:45.540
That says here's one July 17th.

50:45.540 --> 50:46.820
We lost Donald Sobel.

50:46.820 --> 50:51.540
That is, of course, Donald Sobel, author of Encyclopedia Brown books.

50:53.300 --> 50:53.940
Oh, man.

50:55.940 --> 50:59.860
After his after his vacation, we are home.

50:59.860 --> 51:00.740
Don't get the tuna.

51:01.540 --> 51:03.860
What place?

51:03.860 --> 51:05.620
Hey, Dad, I love you very much.

51:05.620 --> 51:08.900
Um, don't have the tuna and do try ceviche.

51:11.540 --> 51:12.420
You're the best.

51:12.420 --> 51:12.900
Thanks, Dad.

51:12.900 --> 51:15.700
I love you so much that your text light up my life.

51:15.700 --> 51:16.660
He's not a man.

51:17.460 --> 51:19.540
These texts, us reading them out.

51:19.540 --> 51:20.980
They're the poorest representation.

51:20.980 --> 51:21.620
They are.

51:21.620 --> 51:26.260
They make him sound completely incompetent when he's actually he's a very, very smart man.

51:26.980 --> 51:33.060
I just don't think he understands the medium, much like I don't think anybody over the age of 43 dies.

51:33.060 --> 51:35.140
Uh, listen, I'm 31.

51:35.140 --> 51:38.420
So I'm going to have to lower that bar to like 30 because I don't get it either.

51:38.420 --> 51:42.100
I don't understand what these these kids are talking about with emojis.

51:43.700 --> 51:44.740
I don't get it.

51:44.740 --> 51:47.860
You know what I'm going to tell you a truth.

51:47.860 --> 51:49.220
Do you guys know what emojis are?

51:49.860 --> 51:58.020
No emojis are like the little icons that are all like all Japanese

51:58.020 --> 52:00.340
phones support them and more phones are starting to support them here.

52:00.340 --> 52:04.180
But they're they're basically icons that are like emoticons.

52:04.180 --> 52:08.580
But they're actually like little pictures that you can use to convey emotion as part of your text.

52:09.860 --> 52:10.420
So they're high.

52:10.420 --> 52:11.940
They are highbrow emoticons.

52:12.740 --> 52:14.980
They're highbrow, highfalutin emoticons.

52:14.980 --> 52:16.260
They're next gen emoticons.

52:16.260 --> 52:17.540
Okay, they're next gen emoticons.

52:17.540 --> 52:18.420
They're called emojis.

52:18.980 --> 52:24.420
And true story for about three months after I first heard the term.

52:24.420 --> 52:26.820
I thought it was a fun slang for emotions.

52:26.820 --> 52:31.220
Like I'm feels the powerful emojis, you guys are guys.

52:31.220 --> 52:32.900
I feel so many emojis right now.

52:33.700 --> 52:37.380
So I'd like to try to repurpose that for that purpose.

52:37.380 --> 52:41.300
Could we maybe get could we maybe get Destiny's Child together to do a

52:42.740 --> 52:44.020
remake of their song emotions?

52:44.020 --> 52:45.300
What the fuck is what?

52:46.100 --> 52:46.660
How is that?

52:47.380 --> 52:47.780
What about?

52:49.380 --> 52:53.140
Also, side note, Griffin, there's no way that's what's bringing back Destiny's Child.

52:53.140 --> 52:57.300
So just one of them is dead, right?

52:58.980 --> 53:00.980
No, no, no.

53:01.700 --> 53:02.660
Oh, Sasha Fierce.

53:03.700 --> 53:06.340
Sasha Fierce is dead because she has been reborn.

53:06.980 --> 53:12.340
So thank you so much for coming and enjoying our program again.

53:13.300 --> 53:16.820
I don't know what continually draws you in.

53:17.780 --> 53:20.260
It's definitely not a pronunciations of simple words.

53:20.260 --> 53:22.740
It's like like continually.

53:23.380 --> 53:26.820
I want to encourage you to follow us on Twitter at MBNBAM.

53:26.820 --> 53:29.380
Subscribe, rate the show, etc.

53:30.580 --> 53:33.220
We have a mailing address now.

53:33.220 --> 53:40.500
It's Justin McElroy or MBNBAM PO Box 54, Huntington, West Virginia 25706.

53:41.140 --> 53:42.740
I only received one thing this week.

53:42.740 --> 53:44.100
It's from Paul and Austin.

53:45.300 --> 53:48.420
There's a note handwritten in what appears to be crayon.

53:48.420 --> 53:49.220
This is going well.

53:49.220 --> 53:50.340
Well, yeah.

53:50.340 --> 53:57.060
It says, please accept this humble offering of 20 fine images of the great Nicholas Cage

53:57.060 --> 54:00.900
printed on only the finest computer paper money can buy.

54:00.900 --> 54:03.060
Sincerely, Paul and Austin.

54:03.060 --> 54:07.460
And when you open the envelope, there are, in fact, 20, I would say,

54:08.180 --> 54:13.220
stamp size pictures of Nicholas Cage that have been printed out.

54:15.060 --> 54:17.060
It was a really good thing to get in the mail.

54:17.060 --> 54:20.820
So that is paying off in dividend, paying dividends.

54:20.820 --> 54:22.340
Can you send a mail or something?

54:22.340 --> 54:23.380
Can you forward those to me?

54:24.580 --> 54:28.980
Yeah, I need them for a completely innocent and healthy purpose.

54:31.300 --> 54:36.020
You can also tweet about the show with the MBNBAM hashtag.

54:38.340 --> 54:40.660
Let's see who's been who's been tweeting this week, guys.

54:42.260 --> 54:43.700
I tweeted some stuff.

54:43.700 --> 54:44.500
Who tweeted?

54:44.500 --> 54:45.700
This is our new segment.

54:45.700 --> 54:46.420
Who tweeted?

54:47.140 --> 54:50.740
I just went to Twitter.com, which is not what the website's called.

54:50.740 --> 54:55.380
No, one of them is, of course, Tony award-winning composer Lin Manuel Miranda.

54:55.380 --> 54:55.940
He's a fan.

54:55.940 --> 54:57.540
Oh, no, not a big deal at all.

54:57.540 --> 54:59.140
No big, no big whoop.

54:59.140 --> 55:00.420
Just enjoys the program.

55:01.140 --> 55:01.700
No big deal.

55:02.580 --> 55:08.260
How long before, how long before you think we become his muse and we have the musical

55:08.260 --> 55:12.740
finally, finally, we, the people demand it.

55:12.740 --> 55:20.820
Rocky Horror, our own personal favorite DJ, is halfway through MBNBAM Mixtape 3, where

55:20.820 --> 55:25.380
our thoughts, our feelings, our dreams are mixed with the beats of today.

55:25.380 --> 55:26.580
So can't wait for that.

55:27.300 --> 55:28.420
Hope he'll bring the drop.

55:29.380 --> 55:37.700

55:43.540 --> 55:47.060
Everybody, thank you so much for tweeting about our program.

55:47.060 --> 55:48.740
It means a lot to us.

55:51.060 --> 55:53.940
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's

55:53.940 --> 55:56.100
A Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

55:57.380 --> 55:59.860
It's a good, you know what it is?

55:59.860 --> 56:06.180
It reminds me of the classic rock that like I used to listen to when I was a kid, when

56:06.180 --> 56:07.060
I was coming up.

56:07.060 --> 56:07.700
You know what I mean?

56:07.700 --> 56:15.460
Like before, just before all the, all the violence and like very sexual.

56:15.460 --> 56:20.260
And sometimes there were drugs that like in the song, like it talks about it and the kids

56:20.260 --> 56:21.700
do them anyway.

56:23.380 --> 56:23.880
Thanks.

56:24.980 --> 56:25.480
Thanks.

56:26.820 --> 56:28.980
And thanks for listening to our podcast.

56:28.980 --> 56:32.100
Griffin has one more Yahoo answer for us to think about.

56:32.100 --> 56:35.300
And of course, as always, we'll return to answer it next week.

56:35.300 --> 56:38.020
But we're just going to ponder it in the days to come.

56:40.020 --> 56:45.940
This final Yahoo answer was sent in by Nicole Thompson.

56:45.940 --> 56:46.660
Thank you, Nicole.

56:46.660 --> 56:50.660
It's by Yahoo Answers user Bunny, who asks, who axes.

56:52.820 --> 56:55.700
How can I break my wrist fast at home?

56:58.580 --> 56:59.540
I'm Justin McElroy.

56:59.540 --> 57:00.420
I'm Travis McElroy.

57:00.420 --> 57:01.220
I'm Griffin McElroy.

57:01.220 --> 57:04.900
It's been my brother, my brother and me, kiss your dad.

57:04.900 --> 57:31.460
And air on the lips.
