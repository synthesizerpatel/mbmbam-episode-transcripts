WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.040
Hi everybody, I'm Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy.

00:47.040 --> 00:50.480
And I'm Ray Romano, because we're going to talk about married life,

00:51.120 --> 00:54.640
and I thought that it would be fun if I was Ray Romano for a while.

00:54.640 --> 00:57.600
This is My Brother, My Brother, Me. It's an advice show for the modern era. Travis,

00:57.600 --> 01:02.080
you've been married for almost exactly one week now.

01:02.080 --> 01:03.920
Yeah, a little over a week, actually.

01:03.920 --> 01:05.600
Just a touch over a week.

01:05.600 --> 01:06.800
Hell- Helen?

01:06.800 --> 01:07.840
Is that his wife's name?

01:07.840 --> 01:09.280
Helen, it's me, Ray.

01:09.280 --> 01:09.760
Helen.

01:09.760 --> 01:12.480
It's spelled H-O-W-A-N.

01:12.480 --> 01:12.880
Ray.

01:12.880 --> 01:13.840
Hey, Helen.

01:13.840 --> 01:14.240
Helen.

01:14.240 --> 01:18.080
Ray Romano. I got kicked out of the house. I'm Ray.

01:18.080 --> 01:21.360
This is My Brother, the Terminator. He causes a lot of-

01:21.360 --> 01:23.440
I ate all the peanut butter, Ray.

01:23.440 --> 01:26.800
Can I say my name is actually Griffin McElroy? Because I'm worried about my brand if I go a

01:26.800 --> 01:30.640
week without saying my actual name on the air, then people will forget who I am. People might

01:30.640 --> 01:33.680
think that I am actually Ray Romano, and that would be terrible for my brand.

01:34.240 --> 01:36.560
How's married life treating you? How's it going?

01:38.080 --> 01:42.560
You know, it's nice to eternally share my life with someone.

01:42.560 --> 01:46.480
Well, it's been a fucking week. Why don't you hold back on that eternally shit?

01:46.480 --> 01:49.920
Yeah, get to seven years, man. Then you're a little bit closer to eternity.

01:50.720 --> 01:53.840
You know, in this day and age, not a lot of couples make it that one week stretch.

01:53.840 --> 01:56.160
Mm-hmm. Yeah. What is it, like 50%?

01:57.200 --> 01:57.520
Yeah.

01:57.520 --> 02:03.040
We goof. I think there was a Kardashian who actually didn't even cut it. I don't think they-

02:03.040 --> 02:06.720
It was actually a Kardashian. I believe it was one of the female Kardashians.

02:06.720 --> 02:13.360
It's the Kardashian-don was the dad of the family. They split up too. They were married

02:13.360 --> 02:18.640
for a grip, though. They were married for like 35 years. Did you guys want some goss?

02:19.920 --> 02:20.480
Yeah.

02:20.480 --> 02:22.320
I know you come to me for all your-

02:22.320 --> 02:23.360
Some Ryan Gosling?

02:23.360 --> 02:23.600
No.

02:23.600 --> 02:24.160
Some goss?

02:24.160 --> 02:30.080
No, some hot sip. There's really no good way to abbreviate that word. But yeah,

02:30.080 --> 02:37.680
they're a splitsville. I saw Chris. I don't know if that's the lady or the dude. I saw-

02:37.680 --> 02:39.520
It's the lady. Bruce is the dude.

02:39.520 --> 02:45.040
I saw Chris at the Country's Best Yogurt, and I saw Bruce across the street at a Cold Stone.

02:45.040 --> 02:49.280
And it's like, I know that you guys are in the mood for a flavored treat,

02:49.280 --> 02:53.680
and that's when I knew that things weren't going to last. It's because they wanted an icy-flavored

02:53.680 --> 02:57.200
treat, and they couldn't get it together on whether they wanted the Country's Best Yogurt

02:57.200 --> 03:00.880
or Cold Stone Creamy. I get it, because Cold Stone Creamy, you have a lot more options,

03:00.880 --> 03:04.720
but come on. It's called the Country's Best Yogurt.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.480
Real quick, Griffin, are you saying Cold Stone Creamy?

03:08.480 --> 03:09.440
Cold Stone Creamers.

03:13.040 --> 03:17.200
Listen, if you want a taste treat, you go to Cold Stone Steve Austin. Everyone knows that.

03:17.200 --> 03:20.160
Cold Stone Creamy was my favorite blaxploitation character.

03:22.080 --> 03:23.120
He's so bad.

03:23.120 --> 03:23.440
I'm just-

03:23.440 --> 03:24.800
Cold Stone Creamy.

03:24.800 --> 03:29.840
If we can't count on Chris and Kardashadon to fucking keep it-

03:30.640 --> 03:35.120
Kardashadon's my favorite Pokemon. Are we gonna make it through a sentence without

03:35.120 --> 03:37.120
talking about how good the new Pokemon game is?

03:38.000 --> 03:40.960
I can't remember anything to add to that conversation. I saw a lot of

03:40.960 --> 03:45.840
kids in line in cosplay as Kardashians.

03:45.840 --> 03:47.920
No, they're-

03:47.920 --> 03:51.600
That would be a baller move to roll it to Comic-Con dresses, your favorite Kardashian.

03:51.600 --> 03:56.000
It was actually an amazing confluence, because we're having Super Se-Con,

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
which is the anime convention for Huntington, on the same weekend as the Pokemon launch.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.680
Oh my god, I don't think I know that. I didn't think I knew that. Is it-

04:04.720 --> 04:07.600
Huntington has an anime convention? Is it in the same building that they have the

04:07.600 --> 04:09.280
hunting and fishing convention?

04:09.280 --> 04:10.720
Yeah, the same one, of course.

04:10.720 --> 04:13.680
Is it on the same day? Because that could be just a movie right there.

04:13.680 --> 04:17.680
Awkward, no. We had the anime convention and the Pokemon launch in one night,

04:17.680 --> 04:22.720
and you should have seen the downtown GameStop. It was like that rave scene from the Matrix,

04:22.720 --> 04:25.520
except if everybody smelled like cabbage and had a sword.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.440
There was a lot of swords.

04:30.640 --> 04:34.400
And also, nobody probably went home and fucked after that. Or maybe everyone did.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.440
Or maybe everyone did.

04:35.440 --> 04:36.640
Maybe everyone did.

04:36.640 --> 04:40.160
I think that if you're a dude in that situation, you're hanging out at the Huntington GameStop

04:40.160 --> 04:43.760
downtown during the anime convention. You look around and go,

04:43.760 --> 04:45.280
if not here, then when?

04:45.280 --> 04:47.200
If not now, then why?

04:49.520 --> 04:50.560
I want to get into the invite.

04:50.560 --> 04:56.000
If not who, then the Incredible Hulk. That's right. I see you, Hulk hands. Come on.

04:58.880 --> 05:01.680
Them shits opposable? Let's do this shit.

05:03.920 --> 05:05.840
Wrap them meaty paws around my meat.

05:05.840 --> 05:10.080
I'm gonna tear you out the rest of them clothes.

05:10.080 --> 05:12.640
I can think of good things to eat for breakfast and dinner,

05:12.640 --> 05:15.680
but when it comes to lunch, I always get stuck on sandwiches.

05:15.680 --> 05:18.720
I'm too poor for those frozen meals that you just microwave.

05:18.720 --> 05:22.080
Any good ideas for lunch? That's from bored of bread and meat.

05:22.080 --> 05:25.440
So you want something better than a sandwich that's cheaper than a banquet meal?

05:26.320 --> 05:26.800
Can't be done.

05:26.800 --> 05:27.520
Trash?

05:27.520 --> 05:28.720
Yeah, I guess just garbage.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.920
Well, hold on, Travis. I don't think that meets the first criteria.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.280
Oh, trash sandwich?

05:35.280 --> 05:36.960
No? Well, that's still a sandwich.

05:38.800 --> 05:41.520
Man, you know what? I think that...

05:42.560 --> 05:44.240
Let me tell you about middle school Griffin.

05:44.240 --> 05:46.480
Can I tell you both about middle school Griffin?

05:46.480 --> 05:47.200
Please do.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.240
Take me to the time tunnel.

05:48.240 --> 05:50.160
Let's hop in the time vortex.

05:50.160 --> 05:52.240
Whoa, I'm drowning.

05:53.920 --> 06:00.320
And middle school Griffin, when he started packing his lunch,

06:00.320 --> 06:03.120
when mommy and daddy taught him how, he was psyched about the idea.

06:03.120 --> 06:10.000
And he would wake up 45 minutes earlier than usual to bake his own artisanal sourdough

06:10.000 --> 06:14.240
and cut off a little crostini that he would bake and season

06:14.240 --> 06:17.920
and then sprinkle into his chef salad that he would take with him,

06:17.920 --> 06:22.560
perfectly preserved in the freezer he had embedded into his locker.

06:23.120 --> 06:29.600
About three weeks after that, my lunch routine was a can of Kmart brand Mountain Dew.

06:29.600 --> 06:36.400
And sometimes a bag of chips and our mom would buy those sandwich bags that didn't zip.

06:36.960 --> 06:38.720
So that was always fun to keep chips in.

06:38.720 --> 06:44.080
I know the one near Taiwan where you had to do some sort of origami fold

06:44.080 --> 06:46.480
to get your chips to stay put and then just hope.

06:47.360 --> 06:51.440
It was more of a suggestion of a container.

06:51.440 --> 06:53.600
Like, hey, chips, why don't you stay?

06:53.600 --> 06:55.200
No, chips, why don't you stay right?

06:56.080 --> 06:58.080
I wish we had been more vocal in our younger years

06:58.080 --> 07:00.720
because we really should have demanded better.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.840
I appreciate the need to cut corners, but that's a corner too far.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.600
Except they didn't cut the corners off our sandwiches.

07:06.400 --> 07:09.200
And also the third element, the third heat that I brought,

07:09.200 --> 07:13.120
because you know how they say every meal has to have three parts of the pyramid in it,

07:13.120 --> 07:14.720
was a little Debbie.

07:14.720 --> 07:20.080
And it was typically that it had the crispy rice and it was puff shaped

07:20.080 --> 07:21.840
and it had some caramel up in it.

07:21.840 --> 07:22.480
Star Crunch.

07:22.480 --> 07:23.280
Star Crunch.

07:23.280 --> 07:27.760
So Star Crunch, a bag of chips and a Kmart brand Mountain Dew.

07:27.760 --> 07:31.040
And some days I would just like not even, I would just open that bag

07:31.040 --> 07:33.440
and I would get so depressed about my 12 year old lot in life

07:33.440 --> 07:34.560
that I would just say, fuck it.

07:34.560 --> 07:35.040
But I guess my point-

07:35.040 --> 07:36.320
So you just skip the entree.

07:36.320 --> 07:38.480
My point is just skip the meal.

07:38.480 --> 07:40.640
I don't think human beings are meant for lunch.

07:40.640 --> 07:44.320
I think just light snacking throughout the day is what you're supposed to do.

07:44.320 --> 07:45.280
I'm into that, Griffin.

07:45.280 --> 07:48.880
I think that if you, man, we don't need as much as we eat.

07:48.880 --> 07:51.440
Now I don't always keep to this rule, but I've been trying to.

07:51.440 --> 07:55.280
And I've been doing this thing where I fast two days a week.

07:55.280 --> 07:56.240
So I eat like 600 calories.

07:56.240 --> 07:56.720
Talk about this.

07:56.720 --> 07:57.440
Talk about this on the show.

07:57.440 --> 08:00.880
Cause it sounds like fucking Nate Silver Witchcraft.

08:00.880 --> 08:01.520
It doesn't sound like-

08:01.520 --> 08:03.360
No, it's called the 5-2 diet.

08:03.360 --> 08:04.800
Basically what you're doing is your game.

08:04.800 --> 08:08.560
It's you eat normally most of the time.

08:08.560 --> 08:11.840
And then two days a week, you have 600 calories.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.120
If you're a dude, 500 calories.

08:13.120 --> 08:14.080
If you're a lady.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.160
For the whole motherfucking day.

08:16.800 --> 08:17.360
Yeah.

08:17.360 --> 08:19.280
That's like one glass of water.

08:19.280 --> 08:20.640
Yeah, basically one glass of water.

08:20.640 --> 08:21.600
Now here's the thing.

08:21.600 --> 08:24.320
What it is basically what you got is body confusion.

08:24.320 --> 08:26.800
Your body never knows when its next meal is coming.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.560
So it's just constantly burning fat out of it.

08:28.560 --> 08:29.680
I've heard of muscle confusion.

08:29.680 --> 08:34.880
But you're talking about getting deep into the entire fucking ecosystem of your guts.

08:34.880 --> 08:38.960
Now, Justin, have you ever woken up and found that your body was so confused that in your

08:38.960 --> 08:41.600
sleep it was scrolling notes to you that just said like, need food.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.200
I'm so hungry, please.

08:43.200 --> 08:47.120
I've carved the word ham into my own forearm using my teeth.

08:47.120 --> 08:55.600
No, but what I have learned is that, man, if you don't eat, that next meal tastes really good.

08:55.600 --> 09:03.040
There's no, I believe it was Rene Dickhart that said there's no greater sauce than hunger.

09:03.040 --> 09:03.280
Yeah.

09:03.280 --> 09:07.840
His veil of ham ignorance, I think, is the philosophical principle that was built upon.

09:07.840 --> 09:11.760
If you skip lunch, what you're saying is I'm ready for a lifetime of delicious dinner.

09:11.760 --> 09:16.080
So I've actually been thinking about this a lot when Rachel and I start churning out

09:16.080 --> 09:20.720
lowlands, I'm not going to introduce them to ham.

09:20.720 --> 09:23.200
Their entire life, I'm not going to introduce them to ham.

09:23.200 --> 09:29.040
And then on my deathbed, on my deathbed, I will pull out a fucking cam's ham, honey,

09:29.040 --> 09:31.120
roasted, not that pineapple shit.

09:31.120 --> 09:33.120
I'm talking bare necessities.

09:33.120 --> 09:33.920
I'm going to pull that.

09:33.920 --> 09:37.120
I'm going to pull it out from under the bedcloth and say, I've seen this your whole life.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.880
Do you imagine there will be a lot of problems with this plan?

09:40.880 --> 09:44.240
Like when your kid's like, we're going to go spend Easter over a friend Sammy's house.

09:44.240 --> 09:45.200
No, you can't.

09:45.200 --> 09:46.320
You can't.

09:46.320 --> 09:51.200
I've got this bitch I've been curing since I was 27 years old.

09:51.200 --> 09:54.160
Look at the striations on this motherfucker.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.880
This shit's going to fall apart in your mouth.

10:00.160 --> 10:01.520
Thank you for this gift, daddy.

10:04.240 --> 10:08.320
But forever, I don't understand pretty much anything you're saying right now.

10:08.320 --> 10:12.880
But I do know that you're going to create an inextricable link between the flavor of

10:12.880 --> 10:15.360
ham and the death of their dad.

10:15.360 --> 10:19.120
So forever, every time the sweet taste of ham comes to their lips, they'll be like,

10:19.120 --> 10:19.920
oh, this is pretty good.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.040
This tastes like my dad dying.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.920
What if they're like, you know, one of those people that just doesn't like the taste of ham

10:25.920 --> 10:28.400
and you die and they take the bite and like, oh, this is like shit.

10:28.400 --> 10:32.080
No, they're going to feel, they're going to feel guilted into liking the taste of ham.

10:32.080 --> 10:35.840
If I've made it my life's goal to force feed them ham on my deathbed.

10:35.840 --> 10:37.200
Yeah, I think they're going to like it.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.760
And by the way, Justin, I'm going to live a full and happy life.

10:39.760 --> 10:43.600
And when they eat ham, they're going to remember me finally with a smile.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.440
They won't regret his death.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.600
They will celebrate his life and also ham.

10:48.240 --> 10:49.360
This tastes like the good times.

10:52.000 --> 10:52.800
What's on this sandwich?

10:56.480 --> 10:58.480
This tastes like the time that dad took me to the lake.

10:58.480 --> 10:59.200
We went fishing.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.840
I remember him for what he was, not for what he wasn't.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.600
I don't like ham.

11:03.600 --> 11:06.320
Hey, I don't know how we got on ham.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.360
I don't like ham.

11:07.360 --> 11:08.080
I'm not into ham.

11:08.080 --> 11:10.000
Well, that's because they got ham council.

11:11.280 --> 11:12.240
Sorry, big ham.

11:14.080 --> 11:14.640
Sorry.

11:14.640 --> 11:15.600
Sorry, John Ham.

11:15.600 --> 11:16.880
Don't mean to let you down.

11:16.880 --> 11:17.680
Corporate ham.

11:17.680 --> 11:20.080
I am sick of your propaganda bullshit.

11:20.080 --> 11:23.520
I hate to keep putting our parents on blast, but I feel like most of the hands we ate as

11:23.520 --> 11:25.120
kids had like pineapple on them.

11:25.120 --> 11:30.080
And that's the, that's arguably sorry Hawaii, but that's the worst possible way to eat ham.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.120
I disagree Griffin.

11:31.120 --> 11:33.920
Cause I remember very distinctly getting many cams ham.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.840
Thanks to dad's Christmas giveaway.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.120
Mm hmm. Yeah.

11:37.120 --> 11:39.360
Some people will take home a $5,000 bonus.

11:39.360 --> 11:40.720
Take home this giant rump.

11:40.720 --> 11:43.760
Cause it was all based on what popcorn tin you picked.

11:43.760 --> 11:44.160
Mm hmm.

11:45.040 --> 11:45.760
That was crazy.

11:45.760 --> 11:46.560
The stupidest.

11:46.560 --> 11:48.480
Anyway, I got a big screen TV that way.

11:48.480 --> 11:48.800
Yeah.

11:48.800 --> 11:48.960
Yeah.

11:48.960 --> 11:51.040
And I got a ham like six years running.

11:51.040 --> 11:53.520
So the girl I like is into rap.

11:53.520 --> 12:00.240
I don't like rap very much, but, and I'm not very into current music, but I told her I love rap.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.120
What do I do?

12:01.760 --> 12:03.040
Thanks if you answered this question.

12:03.040 --> 12:04.720
I absolutely love your show show.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.840
So rental floss sent me to you Gmail.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.680
You're going to have to fake your own death.

12:10.880 --> 12:11.040
Yeah.

12:11.040 --> 12:13.120
I mean, that's a lot easier than hopefully.

12:13.120 --> 12:14.160
Oh my God.

12:14.160 --> 12:19.600
Fake your own death, but make it the result of a, a rap feud.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.480
Maybe try to set up a situation.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.440
Did you hear about Jimmy?

12:23.440 --> 12:23.680
No.

12:23.680 --> 12:23.920
What?

12:23.920 --> 12:25.200
He got shot by Macklemore.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.440
Macklemore brought Jimmy down.

12:27.440 --> 12:32.960
Ian Macklemore had a lot worse rap tycoon that you could be brought down by

12:32.960 --> 12:36.400
in, in today's today's age.

12:36.400 --> 12:37.840
Will Smith shot by Will.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.680
I am Will Smith shot me to death.

12:40.320 --> 12:41.520
I didn't think he had it in him.

12:42.080 --> 12:44.640
I said, I said after earth was just okay.

12:44.640 --> 12:45.760
And he shot me to death.

12:47.680 --> 12:48.960
I got killed by Ja Rule.

12:49.520 --> 12:52.880
To be fair, you guys, if you're delivering the news in person, you're really bad at

12:52.880 --> 12:53.760
faking your own death.

12:54.320 --> 12:54.480
Yeah.

12:54.480 --> 12:55.680
I got shot by Will Smith.

12:55.680 --> 12:56.640
I'm dead now.

12:56.640 --> 12:59.680
You got to put white face powder and a sheet and some spooky.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.600
Oh, sorry guys.

13:01.600 --> 13:01.840
Sorry.

13:01.840 --> 13:03.120
My bad.

13:03.120 --> 13:04.080
Avenge me.

13:05.200 --> 13:09.120
Why did you get yourself into this old dickament in the first place?

13:10.400 --> 13:14.640
Hey everybody, learn from this dude's mistake and then we'll fail to help him.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.400
But first learn from his mistake.

13:16.400 --> 13:21.440
And if the girl says, or a dude says, or anyone says, hey, yeah, I'm really into rap.

13:21.440 --> 13:24.160
Go, oh, you know, I, I'm not a huge fan.

13:24.160 --> 13:25.520
I prefer such and such.

13:26.480 --> 13:29.040
No, you got to drill down into, okay.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.000
That ship has sailed.

13:30.000 --> 13:30.400
Yeah.

13:30.400 --> 13:35.120
What you need to do is you need to drill down it into a specific area of rap music.

13:35.120 --> 13:36.720
I would go classic.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.160
Yeah, that's good.

13:38.160 --> 13:38.880
It's digestible.

13:39.440 --> 13:42.720
Also, it's way, way better than anything except for Kanye West, my beautiful dark

13:42.720 --> 13:46.080
twisted fantasy, which is damn, that's a good one.

13:46.080 --> 13:48.240
What's that Frank Ocean one from, from last year?

13:48.240 --> 13:49.440
Damn, that's a good one too.

13:49.440 --> 13:52.640
I think also check out tech nine, Kansas city's premier rapper.

13:52.640 --> 13:53.920
Well, that was like a decade ago.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.160
I don't think he's their premier rapper anymore.

13:56.160 --> 13:59.200
There's actually some dope shit actually going on right now in the rap scene.

13:59.200 --> 14:03.440
Del, Deltron has dropped his new fucking doom tree.

14:04.640 --> 14:05.040
Okay.

14:05.040 --> 14:07.040
Fucking Macklemore.

14:07.040 --> 14:07.760
So here's the thing.

14:08.720 --> 14:12.240
This is cause I like, I like the rap music.

14:12.240 --> 14:13.280
No, you don't.

14:13.280 --> 14:17.040
I mean, you do, you do in the same level that we all do, but I wouldn't say that you're

14:17.040 --> 14:18.080
an aficionado.

14:18.080 --> 14:19.680
Oh God, no, not at all.

14:19.680 --> 14:22.000
I would not argue that at all, but I'm, I'm a fan.

14:22.000 --> 14:22.720
I enjoy it.

14:24.080 --> 14:26.800
My statement is I feel like it's probably the same as like,

14:26.800 --> 14:32.160
if you try to talk to someone who's like super into indie music and you're like, yeah,

14:32.160 --> 14:34.480
I listened to the December's like they're going to laugh in your face.

14:34.480 --> 14:40.000
It's like Justin, that's the Justin McElroy dilemma or Justin, when he makes fun of hipsters,

14:40.000 --> 14:43.920
he talks about arcade fire and it's like, they want to fucking, they want a Grammy.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.680
Like that's that ain't deep.

14:46.320 --> 14:49.600
So I feel like you couldn't say like, yeah, I'm really into rap music.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.200
I love Jay Z and Kanye West.

14:51.200 --> 14:54.080
I'd love to win that old lady rapped on America's Got Talent.

14:54.080 --> 14:54.400
Yeah.

14:54.400 --> 14:54.880
Right.

14:54.880 --> 14:56.160
Yeah. Right.

14:56.160 --> 14:58.800
Who should, who should this person get into though?

14:58.800 --> 15:00.320
I feel like he's got to drill down.

15:00.880 --> 15:03.200
And I say it's the same thing with, with hipsters.

15:03.200 --> 15:04.080
You make up a name.

15:04.880 --> 15:06.560
Oh, yeah.

15:06.560 --> 15:09.360
And then say like, well, it's just this little, it's this little known dude.

15:09.360 --> 15:10.960
He operates out of San Francisco.

15:10.960 --> 15:12.000
You probably haven't heard of him.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.600
You know, Stone Cold Creamy, right?

15:13.600 --> 15:14.240
Yeah.

15:14.240 --> 15:17.520
Oh, if you liked two chains, you'll love three chains.

15:17.520 --> 15:24.880
You can pretend that your parents only bought you off-brand rap CDs growing up.

15:24.880 --> 15:25.760
They only bought generic.

15:25.760 --> 15:27.280
I prefer Run DMD.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.280
Have you heard Run D&D?

15:31.280 --> 15:35.680
Have you heard it's this Will Smith's seminal album, Big Billy style?

15:37.200 --> 15:39.120
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

15:39.120 --> 15:41.440
You guys into, you guys into Naughty by Nurture?

15:43.200 --> 15:46.320
You know, there's actually a big debate in the psychology community about

15:46.320 --> 15:48.160
Naughty by Nurture versus Naughty by Nature.

15:48.720 --> 15:52.560
Do you guys, do you guys like KVP?

15:52.560 --> 15:56.160
It was, it was, it was TLC's side project.

15:58.640 --> 16:00.000
You got to go classic.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.240
Learn like five of the most seminal rap albums.

16:02.240 --> 16:02.800
But that's the thing.

16:02.800 --> 16:03.520
He fucked himself.

16:03.520 --> 16:04.800
He said, oh yeah, I like rap.

16:04.800 --> 16:11.600
That doesn't mean I, I can do the entirety of, you know, some LL Cool J song.

16:11.600 --> 16:12.080
It means.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.960
But the, but the options are, he has three options.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.480
One, he backpedals and tells the truth.

16:16.480 --> 16:17.600
Well, that's out.

16:17.600 --> 16:21.360
Number two, he learns all, he becomes familiar with all of rap music.

16:21.360 --> 16:22.320
That's out.

16:22.320 --> 16:28.240
He, the only option really is that he, he refined his prior statement.

16:28.240 --> 16:30.960
That, oh, I like rap, but I should have clarified.

16:30.960 --> 16:33.520
I only like rap made before 1989.

16:33.520 --> 16:34.080
Okay.

16:34.080 --> 16:38.400
So you learn, you learn all of Rapper's Delight and you say, I love Sugar Hill Gang.

16:38.400 --> 16:40.240
And then you're in the car with her two years down the road.

16:40.240 --> 16:41.920
You're fucking married and Apache comes on.

16:41.920 --> 16:42.800
She's like, here it comes.

16:42.800 --> 16:45.840
And you're like, hey, Steve, do the thing.

16:45.840 --> 16:46.320
Hey, hey.

16:47.120 --> 16:48.480
She's like, do the trademark dance.

16:48.480 --> 16:51.120
And you start like doing the fucking Super Bowl shuffle.

16:51.120 --> 16:52.640
And she's like, that's not right.

16:52.640 --> 16:53.600
Who did I marry?

16:55.440 --> 16:56.320
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

16:56.880 --> 16:57.440
Yeah, please.

16:59.280 --> 17:01.280
This Yahoo was sent in by Paul.

17:01.280 --> 17:02.240
Thanks, Paul.

17:02.240 --> 17:11.840
It's by Yahoo answers user question mark, a ghost user who asks why does my dad think

17:11.840 --> 17:12.800
I need a bedtime?

17:14.480 --> 17:18.560
So I'm 13 and my dad still makes me go to bed at 10 30 on the weekends.

17:18.560 --> 17:24.320
If you think this is unnormal, that, that I guess everyone is because all my friends

17:24.320 --> 17:25.440
don't have a bedtime.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.600
And Dawn say, oh, your dad is right.

17:27.600 --> 17:30.000
You're only 13 because you know, that's bullshit.

17:32.080 --> 17:32.960
I'm sorry.

17:32.960 --> 17:37.760
Is it dogs say and Dawn say, oh, your dad is right.

17:37.760 --> 17:40.720
You're only 13 because you know, that's some bullshit.

17:40.720 --> 17:42.880
Don't feed question mark a fucking line.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.040
Oh, don't say, don't say, don't speak.

17:47.040 --> 17:47.280
Yeah.

17:47.280 --> 17:51.360
For some reason, I thought he was calling people dogs, but that said, well, you know,

17:51.360 --> 17:52.080
why?

17:52.080 --> 17:54.080
Hey, you don't, that's bullshit.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.800
When did you cast off the shackles of your bedtime?

17:56.800 --> 17:59.280
Because I really think I had one through high school.

18:00.400 --> 18:04.400
I really, I think I remember mom and dad realizing that I was staying up so I could

18:04.400 --> 18:05.440
watch a vault Disney.

18:05.440 --> 18:09.280
So I could watch black and white Zorro and they went, we've lost that one.

18:09.280 --> 18:09.840
Yeah.

18:09.840 --> 18:10.960
Just let him stay up.

18:10.960 --> 18:11.280
Yeah.

18:11.280 --> 18:15.040
It's not like if he doesn't come home till 11 one night, he's getting some pussy

18:15.040 --> 18:15.520
somewhere.

18:16.560 --> 18:19.760
Yeah, he's, he just wants to watch fault Disney.

18:19.760 --> 18:23.440
He wants to watch the making of tomorrow land documentary.

18:23.440 --> 18:24.080
Just let him go.

18:24.080 --> 18:26.480
The making of the making of tomorrow land.

18:27.280 --> 18:31.200
That's what you were, it was about the building of it, but it was narrated by Walt Disney

18:31.200 --> 18:32.320
and it was fascinating.

18:32.320 --> 18:33.280
I would crush that.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.480
I would watch that so hard.

18:35.120 --> 18:38.880
The, uh, I, do you know how I'm 32 years old?

18:38.880 --> 18:42.080
Do you know how much I would love it if I had an adult, my life that would tell me to

18:42.080 --> 18:42.960
go to sleep?

18:42.960 --> 18:44.720
That's the whole reason I got married.

18:44.720 --> 18:47.280
So that Teresa will look over me and go, Hey, it's bedtime.

18:47.280 --> 18:48.320
Thank you, Jesus.

18:48.320 --> 18:49.120
Thank you so much.

18:49.120 --> 18:50.160
Oh, what a relief.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.560
I think I was just keeping my eyes open till you said something.

18:52.560 --> 19:03.680
I think we all have an adult inside of us that, uh, Oh no, I think we all have an adult

19:03.680 --> 19:09.600
inside of me that at 10 30 he goes, Hey, both lights out.

19:09.600 --> 19:14.000
Um, and I think it's just, I think it's, I guess maybe my heart out of my heart at around

19:14.000 --> 19:17.280
10 30 is like a chug, a lug, chug lug.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.280
It's time to go to bed.

19:19.280 --> 19:19.680
Mr.

19:19.680 --> 19:22.720
Man, no vault Disney for you tonight.

19:24.240 --> 19:27.600
You can Tivo that episode of Zorro you've been meaning to catch.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.520
I actually have two internal parents.

19:29.520 --> 19:33.680
I have one that comes by at 11 and says, Hey, it's time for bed.

19:33.680 --> 19:38.880
But if I pitch a fit and I stay up later, I have a much more stern parent that shows

19:38.880 --> 19:40.640
up at two on the weekends.

19:40.640 --> 19:43.680
It says, Hey, Hey, Mr.

19:43.680 --> 19:44.960
Man, Mr.

19:44.960 --> 19:45.360
Mr.

19:45.360 --> 19:47.680
Thinks he's such a hot shot because he's 32 years old.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.600
You will get in the bed right this second.

19:49.600 --> 19:50.080
Don't try.

19:50.080 --> 19:51.680
I've got, I've got two parents as well.

19:51.680 --> 19:56.000
One that says, go to bed at 10 30 and one that the next morning when I decide to stay

19:56.000 --> 20:00.240
out till two, the next morning just sits there with his arms crossed going, so we thought

20:00.240 --> 20:02.160
we'd stay up till two, did we?

20:02.160 --> 20:02.960
And here it is.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.400
Seven 30 awake as always.

20:04.400 --> 20:05.920
See my second, how do we feel?

20:05.920 --> 20:11.120
My second parent, if I make it to like 11 15 PM and my, my brain isn't completely in a

20:11.120 --> 20:16.400
state of total shutdown, then my parent at seven AM beats the shit out of me with an

20:16.400 --> 20:17.280
extension cord.

20:17.280 --> 20:22.320
Travis was pretty no.

20:22.320 --> 20:27.920
I think Travis was more than I ever remember when Travis was like in high school, that

20:27.920 --> 20:29.520
fool would sleep late.

20:29.520 --> 20:33.520
Yeah, you would sleep like 11 or 12 or one or two.

20:33.520 --> 20:35.920
You would just keep on going with it in college.

20:35.920 --> 20:39.680
I used to schedule my classes to only be like afternoon classes, and then I just sleep to

20:39.680 --> 20:41.040
like two o'clock in the afternoon.

20:41.600 --> 20:45.200
And like that, the very concept of that baffles me.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.600
Now every day, every goddamn day.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.680
Now I am up at seven 30 AM.

20:49.680 --> 20:54.560
Yeah, I would, I would go to two to like two was my usual bedtime in college.

20:54.560 --> 20:56.000
That's insane.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.480
That's like a different human that was in my body.

20:58.480 --> 21:00.480
I look at that now and go, what were you doing?

21:02.080 --> 21:08.320
Why do we have so many people just coming in and out of us through our revolving doors?

21:09.280 --> 21:10.480
That's what life is like.

21:10.480 --> 21:13.680
Life is like you're, it's like being James Bond.

21:13.680 --> 21:16.320
You have different actors playing you throughout your history.

21:16.320 --> 21:18.400
The seven stages of man, Griffin.

21:18.400 --> 21:22.000
In the morning, he has four legs.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.360
Wait, how long?

21:23.360 --> 21:29.120
Yeah, and then then he's got three because one of them's waving.

21:29.760 --> 21:34.400
My wife and I both love dressing up for Halloween, but we have one problem this year.

21:34.960 --> 21:38.800
None of our friends are throwing a party and our apartment is too small to host one.

21:38.800 --> 21:41.120
We have no kids to dress up with or take trick or treating.

21:41.120 --> 21:45.200
How can we celebrate without being two costume loners in our living room?

21:45.200 --> 21:47.920
Mainlining Downton Abbey.

21:47.920 --> 21:49.840
That's from Not So Scary in Salt Lake City.

21:49.840 --> 21:51.440
You don't need kids to go trick or treating.

21:51.440 --> 21:54.080
You don't need trick or treating to have fun.

21:54.080 --> 21:57.440
You need, you specifically need to just chill and watch Downton Abbey.

21:58.880 --> 22:00.480
You've been given a pass.

22:00.480 --> 22:02.400
Here's what I'm, here's what I'm going to hit you with.

22:03.760 --> 22:08.320
The Halloween block party in Salt Lake City.

22:08.320 --> 22:12.720
Okay, 6 p.m. to 1 30 a.m.

22:12.720 --> 22:14.720
Got a costume contest.

22:14.720 --> 22:16.160
I'm reading their Facebook page right now.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.840
Got a costume contest.

22:17.840 --> 22:20.160
Got a DJ.

22:21.680 --> 22:25.760
I, okay, I have just noticed that it was in 2009, but wait.

22:25.760 --> 22:27.040
Hold on, hold the phone.

22:27.040 --> 22:28.400
Wait, hold the phone.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.000
Wait, it's still going.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.120
It's still going.

22:31.120 --> 22:31.760
It's amazing.

22:31.760 --> 22:33.680
The Dowager Countess is going to be there.

22:33.680 --> 22:38.000
There's that really cuddly looking Labrador.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.280
There's a, oh no, wait, that's the, that's Downton Abbey.

22:41.280 --> 22:42.320
You should do that thing.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.360
Cause it sounds way better.

22:43.360 --> 22:45.600
Jonathan Rees-Davies is going to be there.

22:45.600 --> 22:49.040
And also that kid who played short round and, oh no, sorry.

22:49.040 --> 22:49.920
That's the Comic Con.

22:50.720 --> 22:51.840
Oh my God.

22:51.840 --> 22:54.320
October 26th, 7 30 p.m.

22:54.320 --> 22:56.960
Head on down to the Maverick Center and you're going to catch the

22:56.960 --> 22:59.760
Macklemore and Ryan Lewis Halloween 2013.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.040
Yes.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.320
There's your event.

23:02.320 --> 23:03.840
Go dressed up as Macklemore.

23:03.840 --> 23:07.920
Did you know that during Macklemore and Ryan Lewis's Halloween shows,

23:07.920 --> 23:10.720
they change all their lyrics to be spookier?

23:10.720 --> 23:11.360
This is true.

23:12.080 --> 23:13.920
That this is the moment.

23:13.920 --> 23:18.080
They actually, at the end, they say, and vampires can't hold us.

23:18.080 --> 23:19.040
This is the night.

23:19.600 --> 23:20.800
It's super spooky.

23:21.360 --> 23:23.760
When I was nine, I thought that I was a skeleton.

23:27.840 --> 23:28.880
Can we have money?

23:28.880 --> 23:40.880
Yeah, I can get you some money.

23:40.880 --> 23:44.960
I had a terrible thing happen to me this week where I recorded

23:46.720 --> 23:47.440
Saturday Night Live.

23:47.440 --> 23:52.480
But because of a sporting event, it didn't start till a half hour later.

23:52.480 --> 23:54.160
My DVR didn't know that.

23:54.160 --> 23:58.160
So I got half hour of sport and then only the first hour of SNL.

23:58.160 --> 24:00.640
And they put the really bizarre stuff at the end always,

24:00.640 --> 24:02.880
or the stuff that they know isn't going to work, but they have to fill time.

24:02.880 --> 24:03.520
Sometimes it does.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.160
I love that stuff.

24:06.160 --> 24:08.720
So I guess I didn't panic, though.

24:08.720 --> 24:09.120
You know why?

24:09.120 --> 24:10.480
Because I got Hulu Plus.

24:10.480 --> 24:14.720
With Hulu Plus, you can stream everything in HD for a great viewing experience.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.960
TV on the go, on your smartphone or tablet.

24:16.960 --> 24:20.960
And you can watch shows when you miss them, which I do.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.560
That's the whole reason I have a subscription.

24:22.560 --> 24:24.400
So I can, A, mainline a bunch of shows.

24:24.400 --> 24:27.520
Like I've been mainlining America's Not Top Model.

24:27.520 --> 24:29.600
Oh, Jesus, 2.0.

24:29.600 --> 24:30.640
It is still popping off.

24:30.640 --> 24:31.200
I can't.

24:31.840 --> 24:35.200
Every week, the guy I think is going to go home doesn't go home.

24:35.200 --> 24:36.640
He's clutching it.

24:36.640 --> 24:37.440
He's clutching it.

24:37.440 --> 24:38.400
He's not letting go.

24:38.400 --> 24:40.960
You can check out exclusive content, including Hulu Originals,

24:40.960 --> 24:42.880
like The Awesomes, starring SNL's Seth Meyers,

24:42.880 --> 24:45.520
and Moon Boy, starring Chris O'Dowd for Bridesmaids.

24:45.520 --> 24:47.600
I got movies if you want that.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.360
And it's only eight bucks a month.

24:49.360 --> 24:49.920
Stream as much as you want.

24:49.920 --> 24:52.800
That's the thing is like, I've got a fucking busy schedule,

24:52.800 --> 24:55.920
but for eight bucks a month, that's worth like a solid weekend

24:55.920 --> 24:58.400
to veg out of just like nothing but Hulu Plus.

24:58.400 --> 25:01.760
Eight dollars, that's like half a movie ticket.

25:01.760 --> 25:03.760
Great news is we got a special deal for you.

25:03.760 --> 25:05.600
HuluPlus.com forward slash my brother.

25:06.240 --> 25:09.840
Get on over there, and you're going to get an extended free trial.

25:09.840 --> 25:10.640
How can you beat that?

25:10.640 --> 25:11.040
You can't.

25:11.040 --> 25:11.680
The answer?

25:11.680 --> 25:12.400
You can't.

25:12.400 --> 25:13.120
I can tell you how to beat-

25:13.120 --> 25:13.920
So stop trying.

25:13.920 --> 25:16.480
I can tell you how to beat this, though, and I'm pointing my dick.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.360
Well, Griffin, you're going to beat your dick,

25:19.360 --> 25:20.560
but you can't do that.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.320
You don't have anything in your home to beat your dick with.

25:22.320 --> 25:26.800
I have hundreds of things, but continue.

25:26.800 --> 25:28.560
I have so, so many.

25:28.560 --> 25:31.920
I could, there's, I have like four avocados in the kitchen.

25:31.920 --> 25:34.080
What the fuck are you talking about?

25:34.080 --> 25:35.360
If you're going to beat your dick-

25:35.360 --> 25:37.280
Did you hear about Griffin's cockamole?

25:37.280 --> 25:39.760
It's delicious.

25:39.760 --> 25:40.640
I'm dead.

25:42.960 --> 25:47.440
If you're going to beat your dick, turn to the professionals at ExtremeRestraints.com.

25:47.440 --> 25:50.240
They have everything you need to fuck so good.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.640
If you want a flicker whip,

25:53.360 --> 25:56.480
you want to put pictures of your whip up for everybody to look at,

25:57.280 --> 25:58.320
put them on Flickr.

25:58.320 --> 26:00.080
But if you want a flicker whip,

26:00.080 --> 26:03.440
that's a braided whip that will make them stand at attention.

26:03.440 --> 26:06.880
27.5 inches braided nylon tassel at the tip,

26:06.880 --> 26:08.560
handle covered in rubber,

26:08.560 --> 26:11.440
and you're going to feel a powerful sting with the impact of this whip.

26:11.440 --> 26:12.800
Do they have Tumblr lube?

26:16.080 --> 26:16.320
No.

26:16.320 --> 26:21.520
No, they do have, they do have Clitter Twitter, which is not-

26:21.520 --> 26:22.560
Interesting.

26:22.560 --> 26:27.120
Do they have LiveJournal, but, but, hold on.

26:27.120 --> 26:31.520
Do they have LiveJournal sex?

26:32.320 --> 26:36.720
Seven inches long, put it in your urethra.

26:36.720 --> 26:37.760
It will shock you.

26:38.560 --> 26:41.600
This is not a torture, this is sexual pleasure.

26:41.600 --> 26:45.760
And it's the electrical urethral sound for just $59.99.

26:45.760 --> 26:47.280
I have a pretty deep urethra.

26:47.280 --> 26:50.800
I have a urethra that goes, like, really far in there.

26:50.800 --> 26:52.640
So seven inches sounds just about right.

26:53.440 --> 26:55.600
If any of this sounds good to you, and I'm sure it does,

26:55.600 --> 26:58.640
go to ExtremeShanks.com, use the coupon code Sexabunga,

26:58.640 --> 26:59.840
and you're going to save 20%.

26:59.840 --> 27:00.960
I mean, here's the beauty.

27:00.960 --> 27:02.880
Even if none of that sounds good to you,

27:02.880 --> 27:04.160
they have such a selection.

27:04.160 --> 27:05.280
You're going to find something.

27:06.080 --> 27:07.040
God, they're just the best.

27:07.040 --> 27:08.240
I've missed them so much.

27:08.240 --> 27:09.360
I got a message for Pete.

27:09.360 --> 27:10.800
It's from Colin and Nate.

27:11.760 --> 27:13.760
And Colin and Nate say,

27:13.760 --> 27:16.080
happy birthday from your two brothers on your favorite show

27:16.080 --> 27:16.880
about brothers.

27:17.440 --> 27:19.840
Thanks for introducing us to all the Maximum Fun podcast

27:19.840 --> 27:21.280
and getting us addicted to that sweet,

27:21.280 --> 27:22.880
sweet drug of chuckles.

27:22.880 --> 27:24.160
We hope you have a great birthday,

27:24.160 --> 27:25.520
but no matter what the McElroys tell you,

27:25.520 --> 27:27.120
don't kiss your dad's square on the lips.

27:27.120 --> 27:28.400
That would be weird.

27:28.400 --> 27:29.920
Travis kissed our dad's square on the lips.

27:30.720 --> 27:33.280
Daddy kissed me on the lips during our wedding.

27:33.280 --> 27:34.080
During my wedding.

27:35.680 --> 27:37.840
We say that every week, but that's not something we do.

27:37.840 --> 27:38.880
And then dad was like, what's up?

27:38.880 --> 27:39.520
He did it.

27:39.520 --> 27:40.320
I tried to stop.

27:40.320 --> 27:40.960
Special moment.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.080
Travis tried to turn away.

27:42.080 --> 27:43.920
It looks like he got half mouth.

27:44.720 --> 27:46.400
I swear to God, he just got mustache.

27:47.120 --> 27:50.160
I was, I mean, I was riding shotgun on that love train.

27:50.160 --> 27:51.840
He grazed mustache.

27:51.840 --> 27:53.440
There was no lip to lip contact.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.200
You literally were pushing him off of you.

27:56.000 --> 27:56.480
Yeah.

27:56.480 --> 27:57.920
Travis, who's the other message for?

27:58.880 --> 28:00.560
The other message is for Steven Ellison.

28:02.160 --> 28:03.040
Do you want me to keep going?

28:03.040 --> 28:03.280
Yeah.

28:04.640 --> 28:05.520
Okay, it's from Ash.

28:05.520 --> 28:08.000
It was at the beginning of a fucking great conversation

28:08.000 --> 28:08.800
between the two of us.

28:08.800 --> 28:09.280
I felt this was an interview.

28:09.280 --> 28:12.000
Just two brothers rapping about who the messages are from.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.760
The message is from Ash Stokes.

28:13.760 --> 28:17.520
And Ash says, Steven celebrates his 23rd name day on October 8th.

28:17.520 --> 28:19.680
You're no friend of mine, but congratulations

28:19.680 --> 28:21.760
on becoming a man grown all the same.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.920
Now, if only you weren't dumber than 10 butts.

28:23.920 --> 28:24.800
Come on now.

28:24.800 --> 28:25.520
Don't use our show for negativity.

28:25.520 --> 28:27.840
It's nice we can bring the friends together.

28:27.840 --> 28:28.560
Yeah.

28:28.560 --> 28:30.880
I mean, I've noticed a trend.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.800
I think it's just sort of the nature.

28:33.840 --> 28:36.320
It's sort of the fact that every thing in the world

28:36.320 --> 28:37.760
is getting coated in mood slime.

28:37.760 --> 28:41.040
But I think that our messages have gotten pretty nasty lately.

28:41.040 --> 28:42.640
I'd like to see some positivity.

28:44.160 --> 28:46.720
Next week, I would like, well, no, not next week

28:46.720 --> 28:47.600
because I'll be in Scotland.

28:47.600 --> 28:51.040
But I would like to see some various messages

28:51.040 --> 28:53.600
that were just like, hey, it's not your birthday.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.440
It's not an anniversary.

28:55.440 --> 28:56.480
I just want to say I love you.

28:56.480 --> 28:57.440
Do you remember that one that was like,

28:57.440 --> 28:58.400
happy birthday, Steve.

28:58.400 --> 29:00.400
Also, fuck you, you fucking asshole.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.640
Like, can we not give Steve a break?

29:02.640 --> 29:06.640
On this day of all days, on Steve day?

29:07.680 --> 29:09.600
To be fair, you did miss Steve day

29:09.600 --> 29:11.760
by like five or six days.

29:11.760 --> 29:12.160
Yeah.

29:12.160 --> 29:14.080
So now who's the fucking asshole?

29:14.080 --> 29:15.280
See, this is getting heated now.

29:15.280 --> 29:17.520
Now we're getting the mood slime on us by contact.

29:17.520 --> 29:20.880
I'm already fucking, I'm the choke off of mood slime already.

29:20.880 --> 29:22.960
I'm fucking coated in that shit.

29:22.960 --> 29:24.880
Everything's so shitty, guys.

29:25.840 --> 29:27.040
I actually like the mood slime.

29:27.040 --> 29:28.240
It cleans my pores.

29:28.240 --> 29:29.360
Do we have farm wisdom?

29:29.360 --> 29:30.640
We don't even have farm wisdom.

29:30.640 --> 29:31.920
Fuck.

29:31.920 --> 29:34.240
Well, that's because farm wisdom is a government program.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.920
I can't fucking believe.

29:36.800 --> 29:38.800
Farm subsidy wisdom.

29:38.800 --> 29:40.000
Farm subsidy wisdom.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
I hate to hold the baby over the cliff.

29:44.320 --> 29:47.520
I hate to put the tiger on the table and yell at it.

29:47.520 --> 29:51.600
But if the government shutdown isn't fixed by next week,

29:51.600 --> 29:52.480
we're going to cancel the show.

29:53.760 --> 29:54.880
That's what it's going to take.

29:54.880 --> 29:55.600
We got to.

29:55.600 --> 29:56.160
And you know what?

29:56.160 --> 29:58.320
Even if they do fix it, I'm canceling the show anyway.

29:58.320 --> 30:00.240
Just to show them what they've done.

30:00.240 --> 30:02.240
Write your senators and congressmen right now and say,

30:02.240 --> 30:03.200
I want to see a letter.

30:03.920 --> 30:08.000
I want someone to send me a letter that they get from their senator or congressman

30:08.000 --> 30:10.400
that references the fact that they're sorry

30:10.400 --> 30:12.160
that they didn't get their my brother and my brother and me.

30:12.160 --> 30:14.880
Tell them we're a government program and we got shut down.

30:14.880 --> 30:19.680
Can we organize a million mom march?

30:21.280 --> 30:21.840
How hard is that?

30:21.840 --> 30:23.760
How hard is one of those to throw together?

30:23.760 --> 30:25.600
How many moms do we know?

30:25.600 --> 30:26.880
I know like eight.

30:26.880 --> 30:27.600
How many you guys know?

30:27.600 --> 30:30.240
I could probably put in like six.

30:30.240 --> 30:30.720
Okay.

30:30.720 --> 30:31.600
Nobody 14.

30:31.600 --> 30:32.400
Nobody has babies.

30:32.400 --> 30:39.120
I know a lot of homebrewers.

30:39.120 --> 30:40.160
How about puppy moms?

30:41.120 --> 30:44.080
If you're a mom, send a letter to your congressman.

30:44.080 --> 30:48.000
I think that our cause is the kind of cause that we could really get all those moms fired up about.

30:48.720 --> 30:50.160
Because we all have cause of we have.

30:50.160 --> 30:51.120
What's our cause again?

30:51.120 --> 30:52.000
Do we have a cause?

30:52.000 --> 30:53.040
I'm just angry.

30:53.040 --> 30:54.960
The government shutdown is not funny anymore.

30:54.960 --> 30:56.880
And it's the only intro we have.

30:56.880 --> 30:58.080
It's the only thing that's going on.

30:58.080 --> 30:59.920
It's the only thing anyone's talking about.

31:00.640 --> 31:03.200
We're definitely going over that fucking fiscal cliff too.

31:04.960 --> 31:06.640
Don't even worry about it anymore, guys.

31:06.640 --> 31:07.520
It's four days away.

31:07.520 --> 31:08.720
Don't even worry about it.

31:08.720 --> 31:10.400
Just like get excited about it.

31:10.400 --> 31:15.680
Just like it's like you're on the King's Island ride and you're going up the hill.

31:15.680 --> 31:20.880
And like just know that it's going to go down the hill and it's going to be like a fun apocalypse thing.

31:20.880 --> 31:23.280
Just stay behind Warren Buffett and you'll be safe.

31:24.240 --> 31:24.560
Yeah.

31:24.560 --> 31:25.600
Go buy some seeds.

31:25.600 --> 31:26.720
My name is Graham Clark.

31:26.720 --> 31:27.920
My name is Dave Shumka.

31:27.920 --> 31:31.120
I'm the other guy who hosts Stop Podcasting Yourself.

31:31.120 --> 31:34.080
And I'm the other guy that hosts Stop Podcasting Yourself.

31:34.080 --> 31:37.520
We are from Canada, so we don't know many of your ways.

31:37.520 --> 31:40.400
But what we do know is quality podcasting.

31:40.400 --> 31:41.360
And whale blubber.

31:41.360 --> 31:41.840
Yeah.

31:41.840 --> 31:44.880
There's 50 different words for podcast in our language.

31:44.880 --> 31:46.240
We would say all 50 of them.

31:46.240 --> 31:50.800
But why don't you just listen to our show and you'll get the gist of what we're about.

31:50.800 --> 31:54.240
We bring a guest on, we talk about their lives, we talk about our lives,

31:54.240 --> 31:57.040
we talk about our lives, we talk about things they've overheard.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.160
It's a great time.

31:58.160 --> 31:58.800
And you know what?

31:58.800 --> 32:00.000
You're not going to regret it.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.360
Stop Podcasting Yourself.

32:01.360 --> 32:04.800
Available from Maximumfun.org or on iTunes.

32:04.800 --> 32:05.600
Brr.

32:05.600 --> 32:07.600
That's what we say in Canada when we're cold.

32:08.960 --> 32:11.840
At the start of the year, I went on a handful of dates with a girl.

32:11.840 --> 32:16.160
We only went on two and then we stopped, which I wasn't hugely upset by.

32:16.160 --> 32:18.400
We're still friends and we see each other occasionally.

32:18.400 --> 32:20.480
She's now dating my best friend who I live with.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.640
They're at our house all the time.

32:22.640 --> 32:25.520
They both seem to think it's a lot more awkward than it actually is.

32:25.520 --> 32:28.640
When I'm around, they both hide away or sit at opposite sides of the room.

32:28.640 --> 32:31.840
They stop talking to each other and they both look really embarrassed.

32:31.840 --> 32:34.560
I don't really care if they're dating, but it seems the two of them think that I care.

32:34.560 --> 32:38.640
I've told them I don't really care, but apparently they seem to think I'm lying or something.

32:38.640 --> 32:40.480
I can't exactly pack my bags and move away.

32:40.480 --> 32:41.200
So what should I do?

32:41.200 --> 32:42.560
That's from Big Tom Awkward Embarrassment.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.160
Way to tie our fucking arms.

32:45.040 --> 32:45.280
Wow.

32:45.280 --> 32:48.080
I had that one cocked and ready and loaded from like sentence two.

32:49.360 --> 32:50.720
You do need to move out though.

32:50.720 --> 32:53.120
Yeah, you got to get out of there.

32:53.120 --> 32:53.520
Yeah.

32:53.520 --> 32:55.440
You don't have to move away.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.280
You do have to move over there though.

32:58.400 --> 32:59.440
Over in that direction.

32:59.440 --> 33:00.400
Maybe two blocks down.

33:01.440 --> 33:05.760
Maybe, kind of like a more natural solution.

33:05.760 --> 33:07.520
Something that I think might make them more comfortable.

33:07.520 --> 33:08.000
Winter back.

33:08.560 --> 33:09.120
Sorry, go ahead.

33:09.120 --> 33:09.600
What?

33:09.600 --> 33:10.160
Winter back.

33:10.800 --> 33:11.600
Sorry, winter back.

33:12.320 --> 33:16.080
No, when you're in the room with them, maybe instead of just telling them that you're okay

33:16.080 --> 33:23.520
with it, maybe start encouraging them, maybe even directing them in some displays of increasingly

33:23.520 --> 33:24.480
intimate affection.

33:24.480 --> 33:24.720
Okay.

33:25.840 --> 33:27.360
So you're sitting there on the couch.

33:27.360 --> 33:28.000
They're sitting there on the sofa.

33:28.000 --> 33:28.720
Start slow.

33:29.520 --> 33:30.080
Start slow.

33:30.080 --> 33:34.320
Just, hey, Daryl, put your hand on her hand, Daryl.

33:34.960 --> 33:36.720
Isn't her hand soft, Daryl?

33:36.720 --> 33:39.120
Stephanie, explore his body.

33:40.160 --> 33:40.960
That's good.

33:40.960 --> 33:41.840
That's good.

33:41.840 --> 33:42.400
That's very good.

33:42.400 --> 33:43.200
Nuzzle her.

33:43.200 --> 33:46.240
Now do that one thing we did together that one time.

33:46.240 --> 33:48.320
You remember that thing I did to you so right?

33:49.600 --> 33:51.040
Do that to her, Daryl.

33:51.040 --> 33:52.160
Oh, what's that?

33:52.160 --> 33:52.960
You don't remember?

33:52.960 --> 33:54.400
I took you to Shoney's.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.400
Take her to Shoney's, Daryl.

33:56.400 --> 33:57.520
Take her to Shoney's, Daryl.

33:57.520 --> 34:00.560
You said it was the most erotic thing anyone had ever done for you.

34:00.560 --> 34:02.320
They got you all those free suckers.

34:02.320 --> 34:06.560
I want you to be like Arnold Schwarzenegger in True Lies directing Jamie Lee Curtis as

34:06.560 --> 34:07.120
she strips.

34:07.120 --> 34:08.960
I want that level of uncomfortable.

34:08.960 --> 34:10.640
Only it's a duo team.

34:10.640 --> 34:11.120
Yeah.

34:11.120 --> 34:13.520
This is going to be super erotic.

34:13.520 --> 34:18.320
I want to see you two get to the concession stand, which is not really first, second,

34:18.320 --> 34:19.760
third, or fourth base.

34:19.760 --> 34:24.080
It's a little bit before, but really, I mean, all of this is foreplay.

34:25.600 --> 34:27.280
Buy her a lick of mate, Daryl.

34:27.280 --> 34:28.160
Buy her a lick of mate.

34:29.120 --> 34:31.760
Daryl, you know those gumballs that look like tiny baseballs?

34:31.760 --> 34:32.320
She loves those.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.040
She loves those.

34:33.760 --> 34:34.960
And then start crying.

34:34.960 --> 34:36.480
And then start crying so hard.

34:36.480 --> 34:37.520
I miss you.

34:37.520 --> 34:38.400
I miss you, Steph.

34:38.400 --> 34:42.240
Remember, I used to buy you ice cream helmets.

34:42.240 --> 34:44.080
I miss you so damn much.

34:44.080 --> 34:46.640
I miss you so damn much, Stephanie.

34:46.640 --> 34:49.760
Do you guys think it's acceptable for adults to eat lick of maids?

34:49.760 --> 34:50.800
This isn't a question.

34:50.800 --> 34:52.880
I know I said it like a question that we have.

34:52.880 --> 34:54.480
I'm asking you right now.

34:54.480 --> 34:56.320
I love lick of maids.

34:56.320 --> 34:57.360
But I cannot think.

34:57.360 --> 34:59.920
I'm just thinking it would look like, I don't know.

34:59.920 --> 35:03.920
I feel like it would look like an ogre eating a child's playset or something.

35:03.920 --> 35:05.840
I feel like I can't eat lick of maids.

35:05.840 --> 35:10.800
I feel like if another adult saw you doing it, they'd think, oh, that's horrendous.

35:10.800 --> 35:13.200
That man has stolen some child's candy.

35:13.200 --> 35:16.880
I feel like I'd look like a fraggle eating a building the doozers built.

35:16.880 --> 35:18.080
Like, just a very sort of.

35:18.080 --> 35:21.920
I think the better simile is you would look like an ogre eating a lick of maids.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.280
Because you're dipping.

35:24.800 --> 35:28.080
That's the kind of shit that's OK to eat when you're a kid.

35:28.080 --> 35:32.480
It's like, oh, you'd need a vehicle for this straight sugar powder?

35:32.480 --> 35:33.280
How about a sugar stick?

35:33.280 --> 35:36.400
I would be less upset seeing you just mainlining coke.

35:36.400 --> 35:39.200
Yeah, or no, probably not that.

35:40.160 --> 35:47.440
You got to be careful, though, because there's a lot of very cheap but fake lick of maids

35:47.440 --> 35:48.160
circulating.

35:49.680 --> 35:54.480
It's that lick of maid crocodile you think you're going to get a flavor treat.

35:54.480 --> 35:58.320
Hey, everyone, can you stop posting pictures of crocodile on social media?

35:58.320 --> 36:00.240
I think I'm overseeing those.

36:01.040 --> 36:02.000
I don't think I need to see any more.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.600
I'm not going to be afraid anymore.

36:03.600 --> 36:09.040
I don't think the fear of crocodile has any actual purpose in my life.

36:09.040 --> 36:13.120
It's not like I was on the street like I need some thrifty heroin on the cheap cheap.

36:14.480 --> 36:16.240
Can I throw something out to our question, Oscar?

36:16.240 --> 36:16.740
Yeah.

36:17.680 --> 36:18.720
What about this?

36:18.720 --> 36:25.600
It sounds to me like they kind of want you to be a little bit upset about it.

36:25.600 --> 36:26.960
Why would they want that?

36:26.960 --> 36:32.800
No, no, no, because it seems like they're unwilling to accept that you're not.

36:33.680 --> 36:36.720
So maybe you could just play into it for a little while.

36:36.720 --> 36:38.080
Because I think here's the thing.

36:38.080 --> 36:42.400
I think that maybe they have convinced themselves that they feel guilty about it.

36:43.200 --> 36:47.440
And they feel like they need to like they feel like they need to feel guilty about it.

36:47.440 --> 36:48.160
To get wet.

36:49.920 --> 36:50.560
Well, no.

36:51.280 --> 36:56.000
You don't have to do anything to appreciate yourself with these two to help them get it.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.120
To help them get get get they craft noodles go.

36:59.120 --> 37:01.920
And I don't think you need to worry so much about that.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.360
Because that's definitely what this is.

37:03.360 --> 37:06.080
This this sex triangle you've just described.

37:06.080 --> 37:10.240
I was saying you could just pretend like it upset you for a little while and then forgive them.

37:10.240 --> 37:11.680
And then they would believe you.

37:11.680 --> 37:13.520
It had nothing to do with intercourse.

37:13.520 --> 37:14.880
Well, it's all means to end it, isn't it?

37:15.840 --> 37:17.120
Well, I mean, that's true.

37:17.120 --> 37:18.080
How is there intercourse?

37:18.080 --> 37:18.960
Have you asked them?

37:18.960 --> 37:19.920
Probably not.

37:19.920 --> 37:20.640
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

37:20.640 --> 37:21.760
Probably it hasn't come up.

37:22.560 --> 37:24.400
I have a Yahoo that was sent in by Drew Davenport.

37:24.400 --> 37:24.800
Thanks, Drew.

37:24.800 --> 37:26.800
It's by Yahoo answers user Timmy who asks.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.040
Am I really in a gang?

37:31.440 --> 37:32.640
So I was playing some b-ball.

37:32.640 --> 37:35.280
That's short for basketball with friends.

37:35.280 --> 37:36.320
Here's our ages.

37:36.320 --> 37:37.040
Me 12.

37:37.600 --> 37:41.520
Friends 12 12 13 14 9.

37:42.080 --> 37:42.720
Wait, go back.

37:42.720 --> 37:44.240
I just start over.

37:44.240 --> 37:45.520
I didn't have my pad and pen.

37:45.520 --> 37:45.760
Okay.

37:45.760 --> 37:46.800
Okay, go ahead.

37:46.800 --> 37:49.680
We're doing with three 12 13 14 and a nine.

37:51.040 --> 37:52.480
One of them is wearing red shoes.

37:52.480 --> 37:53.600
Now one of them.

37:53.600 --> 37:56.000
One of them can't the 13 has a bag of corn.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.200
The other has some chickens.

37:57.760 --> 37:58.720
We only have one boat.

37:59.920 --> 38:01.440
They're playing some b-ball.

38:01.440 --> 38:02.320
So they said, I'm sorry.

38:02.320 --> 38:04.000
And b-ball is short for what now?

38:04.000 --> 38:07.280
B-ball is short for basketball.

38:07.280 --> 38:08.800
And so they were playing it.

38:08.800 --> 38:10.320
They were their teens and tweens.

38:10.960 --> 38:15.120
And they say they are in an ICP Juggalo gang.

38:16.560 --> 38:19.200
They supposedly jump me in.

38:20.160 --> 38:21.600
Am I really in or what?

38:21.600 --> 38:25.200
What I think you may have just gotten beat up.

38:25.760 --> 38:26.080
Did he?

38:26.720 --> 38:27.760
Did he feel the shiver?

38:28.400 --> 38:29.120
What's the shiver?

38:30.000 --> 38:32.320
You know, when when ICP comes over, yeah.

38:35.200 --> 38:41.440
Are you saying that moment when you finally decide to start following the clown to get

38:41.440 --> 38:45.920
down with the clown and when you accept the clown into your heart, commuting with nature

38:45.920 --> 38:50.000
and then like it's a beautiful sunshine day and then the rain starts falling and it's

38:50.000 --> 38:53.840
cool and refreshing and you just you see the face.

38:53.840 --> 38:56.240
Yeah, that's a fucking miracle.

38:56.240 --> 38:58.000
It is a fucking miracle in the sky.

38:59.120 --> 39:02.240
And then your friends beat the ever loving fuck out of you.

39:04.720 --> 39:08.080
I mean, that's every second you see Violet J.

39:08.080 --> 39:10.640
But it turns out it's just your school's janitor crying.

39:13.200 --> 39:14.080
I mean, you're in the gang.

39:14.080 --> 39:14.720
We've all been there.

39:16.240 --> 39:18.560
I don't think there's any doubt that you're in a gang now.

39:18.560 --> 39:20.640
I think we can actually speak louder than words.

39:20.640 --> 39:23.040
I mean, have you been participating in the gang?

39:24.960 --> 39:26.560
Well, I mean, I think this happened.

39:26.560 --> 39:30.000
I think they're like literally writing this hurriedly on their phone after they just got

39:30.000 --> 39:31.760
the shit after they just got jumped in.

39:31.760 --> 39:36.240
I think not like after a couple of meetings and no, I think that would I think they would

39:36.240 --> 39:41.840
fucking present that information if like he had to go out and buy all clown clothes like

39:41.840 --> 39:44.720
I think they've made me take the minutes.

39:44.720 --> 39:46.960
Is that something that the gang members do?

39:46.960 --> 39:51.040
Yeah, it just that's going to look great on a college resume, by the way, and under extracurriculars.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.760
We've done a lot of civic work.

39:53.760 --> 39:55.600
We've been cleaning up the neighborhood.

39:55.600 --> 39:56.560
We adopted a highway.

39:57.360 --> 40:00.000
Young Lurch, can you review the minutes, please?

40:01.040 --> 40:06.320
Yeah, basically, Stinky Stan just talked about how his mom is a total bitch, and then we all

40:06.320 --> 40:09.440
pounded some faggot and went home and thanks.

40:09.440 --> 40:10.000
Thank you.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.280
Thank you, Little Lurch.

40:13.680 --> 40:15.200
I think you're in the gang is what I'm saying.

40:15.200 --> 40:18.960
There's no doubt about it, you're in a gang, you're in a gang, you're a gang member, you're

40:18.960 --> 40:23.920
a gang banger, I think is the the the collective term.

40:24.960 --> 40:28.000
The question is, is your gang a gang or not?

40:28.000 --> 40:29.040
You're in a gang.

40:29.040 --> 40:32.960
Oh, but is the gang is the gang true?

40:32.960 --> 40:34.240
Is it a true gang?

40:34.240 --> 40:36.320
Now, if you're listening, does it follow the true path?

40:36.320 --> 40:38.880
If you listen to the feds, oh, they'll bust you for anything.

40:38.880 --> 40:39.600
They'll bust it.

40:39.600 --> 40:42.960
Well, they think that they think anybody who's down for clown is part of a gang.

40:42.960 --> 40:44.000
Yeah, that's what they think.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.400
Part of a gang, that's what the FBI says, at least.

40:46.400 --> 40:51.760
Now, now, Violent J said that he was going to and Shaggy 2 Dope said they were going

40:51.760 --> 40:55.120
to take the feds to court over this.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.040
That hasn't materialized yet.

40:57.040 --> 40:59.600
But, you know, they've had a lot of empty promises in the past.

40:59.600 --> 41:05.040
So you're telling me that Juggalo Nation is like a fucking registered like FBI.

41:05.600 --> 41:09.920
Like if they see someone with a hatchet man tattoo, they are public enemy number one.

41:10.720 --> 41:11.200
Correct.

41:11.200 --> 41:16.800
They were classified as a a violent street gang by the FBI.

41:16.800 --> 41:19.440
That's what the FBI said, that anybody down clown.

41:19.440 --> 41:22.800
To be fair, that's also true of anyone that likes Dave Matthews Band.

41:24.480 --> 41:25.680
Okay, that's fair.

41:25.680 --> 41:28.560
That guy blew the clarinetist for Dave Matthews Band.

41:28.560 --> 41:28.960
Get him.

41:30.560 --> 41:31.440
Gotta take him down.

41:32.320 --> 41:33.760
Where'd you get those Birkenstocks?

41:35.760 --> 41:39.360
Just let Juggalo, just let Juggalos be Juggalos.

41:39.360 --> 41:42.800
I mean, it's literally I think it's all that Juggalo fans have.

41:42.800 --> 41:46.160
It's like and I'm not hating you think we have.

41:46.160 --> 41:49.200
I think maybe even asked this question before if we have Juggalo listeners,

41:49.200 --> 41:51.440
because I don't think it's outside of the realm of possibilities.

41:52.160 --> 41:56.000
I think that our special brand of comedy.

41:56.000 --> 42:00.240
Yes, air quotes would greatly appeal to fans of the Juggalo Nation.

42:00.240 --> 42:04.720
If you if you can get on board with two men in clown makeup,

42:04.720 --> 42:11.920
I think that us talking about ghost horses, etc. It would be right if you're out.

42:11.920 --> 42:16.560
And you also have to think that at this at this point, at this point in society,

42:16.560 --> 42:18.080
Juggalos have heard it all.

42:18.080 --> 42:20.480
There's nothing we're going to say that they're not going to go.

42:20.480 --> 42:22.480
Listen, we see why you would feel that way.

42:22.480 --> 42:24.640
But let me give you a little bit of literature.

42:24.640 --> 42:25.680
I think will open your eyes.

42:25.680 --> 42:29.120
Juggalos think our show is a documentary is what I'm saying.

42:29.120 --> 42:32.240
They have seen all of this happen on on drug bridge.

42:32.240 --> 42:36.400
This is all this is all occurred before they've seen it in prophecy.

42:36.400 --> 42:39.200
Everything that we've spoken of did.

42:39.200 --> 42:44.960
Do you guys know if the if they reveal the third card of the second deck yet in the dark carnival?

42:45.600 --> 42:47.760
You know, anybody heard?

42:47.760 --> 42:49.760
Are you talking about like the Stephen King books?

42:49.760 --> 42:51.680
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about right now.

42:52.560 --> 42:53.440
All right. You guys.

42:53.440 --> 42:58.880
OK, so the the the Juggalo everybody, if you haven't listened, read Nathan Rabin's book.

42:58.880 --> 43:00.000
You don't know me, but you don't like me.

43:00.000 --> 43:05.840
It's a it's a book that simultaneously chronicles fish fandom and Juggalo fandom.

43:06.560 --> 43:08.720
Are fish fans considered dangerous by the FBI?

43:10.720 --> 43:14.320
They're considered a highly dangerously mellow dangerously.

43:14.320 --> 43:17.120
They are murderers because they're like, hey, listen, this one song.

43:17.120 --> 43:20.160
And then you're like afterwards, you're like, oh, yeah, that was great.

43:20.160 --> 43:21.920
Oh, my God, I'm 86 years old.

43:21.920 --> 43:22.560
And then you die.

43:25.280 --> 43:26.240
They're like the angels.

43:26.240 --> 43:29.520
I was a young man and now I'm an old man.

43:29.520 --> 43:30.320
You looked away.

43:31.360 --> 43:33.120
You looked away from the groove.

43:34.240 --> 43:36.480
There are the group don't blink.

43:36.480 --> 43:38.480
Also, don't listen.

43:38.480 --> 43:39.680
It's not good.

43:40.320 --> 43:40.720
It's not.

43:44.320 --> 43:45.760
I bet he's going to do the next.

43:45.760 --> 43:46.160
Nope.

43:46.160 --> 43:46.800
Oh, fuck.

43:46.800 --> 43:48.160
Sixty years went by.

43:48.160 --> 43:48.880
Shit.

43:48.880 --> 43:51.120
I supposed to pick my kids up from soccer practice.

43:51.120 --> 43:52.240
They're definitely skeletons.

43:52.240 --> 43:59.760
I hope someone raised and fed my my children and picked them up from soccer practice.

43:59.760 --> 44:00.560
I hope they weren't wolves.

44:02.480 --> 44:03.520
I like fish.

44:03.520 --> 44:04.880
Shut the fuck up.

44:04.880 --> 44:05.600
You shut up.

44:06.480 --> 44:09.920
OK, so I'm going to give you the brief summation of this because I know we don't have much time.

44:09.920 --> 44:12.000
The dark carnival is the afterlife, right?

44:12.000 --> 44:13.920
That's what that's what ICP says.

44:13.920 --> 44:15.600
They have that sounds terrible.

44:15.600 --> 44:18.160
That's like the opposite of what most churches espouse.

44:19.120 --> 44:20.080
OK, yes, correct.

44:20.080 --> 44:30.160
There are there is they have basically instead of a Bible, what they have is the the Joker's deck, right?

44:30.160 --> 44:38.880
So the Joker's cards are in two decks and each album is a Joker's card in the deck.

44:38.880 --> 44:42.400
So the first deck was like the first six albums.

44:42.400 --> 44:43.520
I think the last one was death.

44:43.520 --> 44:48.480
And then they came back and they were like, wait a minute, we didn't allow for enough prophecy.

44:48.480 --> 44:53.280
We were honestly underestimating how much prophecy we'd have.

44:53.280 --> 44:57.680
We've got a second deck of Joker's cards and we've only seen two of those so far.

44:58.480 --> 45:05.440
Bang, Wham, Boom and the Mighty Death Pop are the two the first two cards in the second deck.

45:05.440 --> 45:08.160
So we're eagerly awaiting what the third card.

45:08.160 --> 45:09.920
Are we at Justin?

45:09.920 --> 45:10.800
Hey, Justin.

45:10.800 --> 45:11.440
Yeah.

45:11.440 --> 45:12.880
Are you proud of yourself?

45:12.880 --> 45:14.400
I feel pretty good about it right now.

45:14.400 --> 45:16.160
Juggalo Church camp right now.

45:16.160 --> 45:20.480
Like it's just about to bust out an acoustic guitar and just play three chords.

45:20.480 --> 45:24.480
OK, so yes, ladies and gentlemen, here's the juggler.

45:25.120 --> 45:26.720
He'll cut your windpipe.

45:28.560 --> 45:30.880
This first beat on my bracelet represents.

45:30.880 --> 45:32.400
Thank you, ICP Jesus.

45:33.840 --> 45:35.520
Anybody feeling moved, come down.

45:35.520 --> 45:36.640
Everybody touch Mike.

45:37.280 --> 45:39.280
Everybody touch and cry over Mike.

45:39.280 --> 45:41.600
He'll cut your motherfucking heart out.

45:44.880 --> 45:45.840
Beautiful night outside.

45:45.840 --> 45:46.720
Anybody feeling moved?

45:48.960 --> 45:51.440
Who wants to stand up and rededicate their life?

45:52.240 --> 45:53.360
You're all going to go home tomorrow.

45:53.360 --> 45:55.120
You're not going to see that girl you're crushing on again.

45:55.680 --> 45:59.840
You can see this feature at the world famous Carnival of Carnage.

45:59.840 --> 46:00.320
Anyone?

46:00.960 --> 46:01.440
Anyone?

46:02.560 --> 46:05.360
This is my one fucking show a year.

46:06.400 --> 46:07.920
Keep keep juggling, motherfuckers.

46:07.920 --> 46:09.840
When you go home, take that message home.

46:09.840 --> 46:10.720
Keep on juggling.

46:11.760 --> 46:12.800
Keep on juggling.

46:12.800 --> 46:13.440
Never stop.

46:13.440 --> 46:15.760
Thank you so much for listening to our program.

46:38.560 --> 46:40.480
Thank you so much for tweeting about our program.

46:40.480 --> 46:45.520
When you do that, please use the nbambam hashtag and try to share a sampler.

46:45.520 --> 46:49.360
If you think about it, it's bit.ly forward slash nbambam2013.

46:49.360 --> 46:51.520
Also, thanks again to Hulu Plus.

46:51.520 --> 46:52.020
Oh, yeah.

46:52.800 --> 46:54.880
Make sure to check out Hulu Plus if you haven't already.

46:58.160 --> 47:00.480

You can get that by going to huluplus.com slash my brother and then huluplus.com.

47:06.800 --> 47:09.280
Then the forward slash, that one that kind of like leans.

47:09.280 --> 47:09.780
Which one?

47:09.780 --> 47:12.120
Because there's two of those that you just described.

47:12.120 --> 47:13.800
It kind of leans into it.

47:15.960 --> 47:19.640
Yeah, even if you if I hear you out there, you're like, oh, but I don't watch TV.

47:19.640 --> 47:24.920
Just think of it as a $7.99 subscription to ANTM 2.0 Boys in the House.

47:24.920 --> 47:29.720
If you don't if you don't watch it, nobody you're not going to have anything to talk to to anyone.

47:30.680 --> 47:32.280
A special PSA.

47:32.280 --> 47:35.960
We are not going to have an episode next week because Travis is leaving.

47:35.960 --> 47:39.960
I might make a Greatest Hits episode from the second deck.

47:41.560 --> 47:42.440
That's good.

47:42.440 --> 47:43.160
People seem to like that.

47:43.160 --> 47:44.760
So how long are you going to be in Scotland, Travis?

47:45.800 --> 47:46.520
10 days.

47:46.520 --> 47:47.160
Oh, yeah.

47:47.160 --> 47:47.640
OK.

47:47.640 --> 47:49.720
Yeah, you should probably whip up one of those juicers.

47:49.720 --> 47:52.920
I do want to say if you want to get in a good mood, and this is a shameless plug,

47:52.920 --> 47:55.240
but I know it's kind of a long shot.

47:55.240 --> 47:59.400
But my wife, Sydney, and I, who you may know from the Max Button podcast,

47:59.400 --> 48:00.760
Sawbones, we directed a musical.

48:00.760 --> 48:01.880
It's birds playing Superman.

48:02.520 --> 48:04.680
And you got one last chance to see it this weekend.

48:04.680 --> 48:08.200
And it's in Huntington, West Virginia, of course, at Huntington High School.

48:08.200 --> 48:11.320
And it's Friday and Saturday at seven and Sunday at two.

48:11.320 --> 48:17.960
So if you can come by, I will personally come give you a huge hug and chill with you.

48:17.960 --> 48:21.160
We actually had some folks come up from Philadelphia.

48:21.160 --> 48:21.960
Oh, you're kidding me.

48:21.960 --> 48:23.960
People drove down from Philadelphia to see.

48:23.960 --> 48:27.720
Yes, my new best friends, Lori and Hal, drove all the way from Philadelphia,

48:27.720 --> 48:30.040
chilled in Huntington, went to Hillbilly Hot Dogs,

48:30.040 --> 48:32.680
had a heck of a time, had a blast on their road trip.

48:32.680 --> 48:34.760
You are offering a guaranteed hang.

48:35.400 --> 48:37.400
This is a full, full.

48:37.400 --> 48:38.040
You come down.

48:38.040 --> 48:38.760
We're going to hug.

48:38.760 --> 48:39.480
We're going to chat.

48:41.160 --> 48:42.760
You can see my childhood home.

48:42.760 --> 48:44.280
You can see where I went to school.

48:44.280 --> 48:46.520
You can see where I became me.

48:46.520 --> 48:47.560
Another shameless plug.

48:47.560 --> 48:50.680
Our childhood home has been for sale for like two years.

48:50.680 --> 48:54.200
If you want to buy our childhood home and just like live there in Huntington,

48:54.200 --> 48:58.440
Justin will hang out with you every day.

48:58.440 --> 49:02.840
Please, please remove this enormous sickening financial burden from our dad.

49:03.400 --> 49:05.320
Please buy this fucking house.

49:05.320 --> 49:06.520
Please buy our childhood home.

49:06.520 --> 49:09.640
Our dad has no money saved because of this fucking money pip.

49:09.640 --> 49:11.640
Can we do a Kickstarter to buy our house?

49:11.640 --> 49:13.960
And then just burn it to the fucking ground.

49:13.960 --> 49:17.160
We'll make it an Airbnb for NBNBA fans who want to come visit.

49:17.160 --> 49:18.040
Simple offer.

49:18.040 --> 49:21.720
Go to Huntington, see the sites, go see Justin's show.

49:21.720 --> 49:23.640
Buy our fucking house, please.

49:25.640 --> 49:26.760
Thank you so much for listening.

49:26.760 --> 49:27.400
Great neighborhood.

49:27.400 --> 49:28.760
Also, thank you to John.

49:28.760 --> 49:30.440
Thank you to John Roderick in the long winter.

49:30.440 --> 49:32.440
Yes, of course, for our theme song.

49:32.440 --> 49:34.200
It's a departure off the album.

49:34.200 --> 49:35.240
Putting the days to bed.

49:35.240 --> 49:37.560
You can buy it at iTunes retailers.

49:37.560 --> 49:38.680
Don't Spotify it.

49:38.680 --> 49:45.080
I've been hearing some bad shit about Spotify and Pandora lately that that they're haunted.

49:45.080 --> 49:45.720
They're haunted.

49:45.720 --> 49:46.600
They're full of ghosts.

49:46.600 --> 49:48.360
Every third song you hear on there is a ghost.

49:48.360 --> 49:49.000
Anyway, thank you, John.

49:50.520 --> 49:55.400
Griffin, we got we got a long layover until our next episodes.

49:55.400 --> 49:58.920
I hope you got a great one to take us on a journey.

49:58.920 --> 49:59.400
Yeah, sure.

49:59.400 --> 50:01.000
This one was sent in by Ashley Burgart.

50:01.000 --> 50:01.640
Thanks, Ashley.

50:01.640 --> 50:03.800
It's by Yahoo Answers user Caitlin, who asks,

50:05.560 --> 50:07.720
where can I get some spaghetti in Denver?

50:11.080 --> 50:12.360
I'm Justin McElroy.

50:12.360 --> 50:13.560
I'm Travis McElroy.

50:13.560 --> 50:14.920
I'm Ray Romano.

50:14.920 --> 50:15.720
No, that was terrible.

50:15.720 --> 50:16.440
Can I try again?

50:16.440 --> 50:17.960
I'm Henry Romano.

50:17.960 --> 50:19.000
That was pretty good.

50:19.000 --> 50:19.640
That was pretty good.

50:19.640 --> 50:20.840
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

50:20.840 --> 50:21.720
Kiss your dad.

50:21.720 --> 50:26.920
Square on the lips.
