00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:21.000 --> 00:31.000
It's familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
It's a new craze, and good girls do you want it?

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Just say, hey, I want it.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
Just say, hey, I want it.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
And I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 on 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
January 27th has been marked on my calendar since last January 27th.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Oh, I've got goose pimples.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
I'm so excited about A Dog's Purpose.

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
Just bristling with goose flesh over here, so excited for A Dog's Purpose that comes out on January 27th in theaters near you.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
I'm really excited about it.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I think it's going to be a huge picture.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
There have been multiple reports of abuses to dogs during filming.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.000
And I think the film is going to be a real heartwarming picture for families to enjoy together.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
I'm just glad that the movie goes out of its way to prove that A Dog's Purpose is to entertain us.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Yes, and then die, but then be a different dog later.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
What the cost.

01:44.000 --> 01:54.000
My favorite part of the trailer is when the beagle dies and then is a golden retriever, which then dies in an airplane crash, and then all of a sudden it's a beagle again.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
I love you, A Dog's Purpose.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
It's A Dog's Purpose.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
When they were making it, they were like, what's everybody's favorite part of Marley and Me?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
The end of it.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
So what if they just made a movie that was all the end of Marley and Me, just over and over again forever?

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
The dogs die over and over again.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
But then you get a new dog.

02:11.000 --> 02:20.000
You would think at some point this dog would be like, okay, so reincarnation is real, but I am just a dog.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
Like, what do I have to do here to get out of this cycle?

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
I'm just a dog over and over again.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Different breeds, of course.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
I mean, I don't want to be a whippet.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
I want to be a chocolate lab, so let's go talk to that bus.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Poof.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Thank you.

02:35.000 --> 02:44.000
Okay, I haven't seen it, but do you think the movie ends in the final incarnation, the dog wakes up, and they are finally a human?

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
No, I think the final incarnation is he wakes up and he's half dog, half man.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
He's like, well, it's a start.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
Maybe they go full action hero.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
And then some badass Guy Ritchie end credits.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
There we go.

02:59.000 --> 03:08.000
We could also have a bicentennial man situation where he does become a human and he does marry his master, the woman who owned him the whole time.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
And then they fall in love.

03:10.000 --> 03:17.000
Listen, I really want to marry you, but I am a dog now, but I have a very good feeling about this one.

03:17.000 --> 03:24.000
So if you could throw me into that wood chipper and just let me try one more again, I think that I will come back as a human on this one.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
So what you're pitching like a Marley and Me Groundhog's Day crossover.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Right, exactly.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
He does some good shit for like an afternoon.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
He's like, well, time to beef it.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Let's see if I can be a human this time.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
A lot of people forget it was a book first.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Yeah.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
A Dog's Purpose was a 2010 novel written by American humorist W.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
Bruce Cameron, who I'm sure you all remember from 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
Yeah, which was a series that was also adapted into.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
Please tell us, please tell us more about 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter, Justin.

04:01.000 --> 04:10.000
8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter was adapted into a TV series that, of course, killed John Ritter is the most notable.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Oh, Justin.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
It did.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
I mean, it did.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
What do you want from me?

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
That's the show that killed John Ritter.

04:15.000 --> 04:22.000
So Bruce has had a good run, and now he's back with just killing dogs over and over again.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Not dogs, the same dog.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
The same dog.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
And Dennis quades in the movie, and at the end of it, he dies, and he becomes five birds.

04:31.000 --> 04:38.000
I think I had the same reaction a lot of people did the first time they saw the trailer, that my wife showed it to me, just like losing it.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
Like couldn't do anything, just hold the phone aloft for me to view.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
I thought for sure it was a Christian movie.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Like it had to be a Christian movie.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
This is a Christian movie.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
That endorses dog reincarnation.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Yeah, we're like Jesus.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
He helps Jesus or tell somebody about Jesus or helps them find Jesus or something.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Why is there only one set of paw prints?

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Exactly.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
That's where I did fun dog tricks for your entertainment.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
But then I saw Dennis Quade, and I was like, Denny, are you doing okay?

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
Denny, are you in the film?

05:11.000 --> 05:22.000
For the first, until Denny's reveal in the movie, in the trailer, you could have very easily convinced me that we were looking like an Animal Planet original movie.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Sure.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
That they were getting into the movie business.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
But then he was like, he calls his agent.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
He's like, listen, it's Denny.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Just finished up that script.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
For a dog's purpose, you sent over that hot one.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
Denny Q got the script.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Denny Q got the script, did absorb.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Listen, five stars.

05:47.000 --> 05:53.000
This script only needs one thing, and I think this film will flop unless you make one big change.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
And they're like, what?

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
And he's like, you're going to need some vitamin D.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
And that's for goodness.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
You're also going to need to kill three times more dogs.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
There's only eight dogs that die in it.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
I haven't seen the movie yet.

06:07.000 --> 06:13.000
But as I understand it, it's about a dog that keeps dying and coming back as other dogs that keeps finding Dennis Quaid.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
And trying to kill him.

06:15.000 --> 06:22.000
I hope there's a scene in the movie where Dennis Quaid lives in Connecticut or whatever, and then the dog falls in the lake.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
And then it comes back, and it's a chocolate lab.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
But, oh, damn it, I'm in Wales.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Well, fuck.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
I've got to get all the way back.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Damn it.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
And he finally gets back to Connecticut after like a year of getting there.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
And he's like, hey, what's up?

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
And then a tree falls on him, and he's like born in Madagascar.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
And he's like, why the fuck is this so much travel?

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
You know once he gets stateside, he's being like super cautious.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Like every street.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
No, no, no, I'll wait for the light.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
I know I'm a dog.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
But I'm going to go ahead and wait for the light.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Griffin, I actually saw a press screener of the movie.

06:58.000 --> 07:05.000
And the fucked up thing is the dog actually keeps being reborn in like the same town that Dennis Quaid was originally in.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
And Dennis Quaid keeps moving.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Yeah.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
Dennis Quaid keeps trying to get away from this fucking dog, and the dog keeps finding him every time.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
And that's the dog's purpose.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
I'm going to teach English in Shanghai.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Ah, damn it.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
How am I supposed to?

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
I'm a dog, DQ.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Hey, DQ.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
DQ.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Help me.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
DQ, why do you do this?

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Why do you do this to me, DQ?

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
The thing they don't tell you is that Dennis Quaid kills the dog every time.

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
And the dog is just trying to like – he knows he's got a serial killer on his hands.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
And he's trying to reveal the crime.

07:40.000 --> 07:47.000
And every time he gets close, Denny Q is like, nah, nah, nah, not this time.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
Well, just like well, just put it in a well.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Yeah.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
He starts it out so it won't reincarnate as fast, it gives him time to get away.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
God.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
It's a dark movie, Griffin.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
I don't know what to tell you.

08:02.000 --> 08:09.000
It's the lovely – it's the lovely bones, which would also work as a title for a dog-based movie.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
The milky bones.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
The tasty bones, the begging strips.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Boy, a dog's purpose out January 27th.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
I'm so excited to see it and see if all the fan theories are true.

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
I've been playing along with the ARG online, and we're all having a lot of fun here at the –

08:26.000 --> 08:32.000
we call ourselves the purpose heads, and we're just so fucking excited for this movie.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
A Dog's Purpose is – it's buck wild.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Very important to me.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
It's very important.

08:37.000 --> 08:44.000
I did want to release – and again, some pretty brutal animal abuse allegations that are in no way funny,

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
but it is A Dog's Purpose is the name of the film.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
So if you want to avoid it or watch it – I feel like a watch doesn't always have to be positive.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
Sometimes it's sort of like, I got my eye on you.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
You know what I mean?

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Yeah.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
I got a crime watch.

09:00.000 --> 09:08.000
How do you think Deque is feeling right now after these dog abuse allegations have started popping off?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Because holy shit.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
I read some of the responses from people involved, like Josh Gad is the voice of the dog.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Josh Gad's fully like, don't know, wasn't there.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
The director of the movie is like, don't know, wasn't on set that day.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Wouldn't have happened if I had been there.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Hachi machi.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
I'm sure Deque felt the same way.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
He's like, no, I was getting some crafty and just enjoying myself and trying to center myself for the performance.

09:29.000 --> 09:35.000
They had tortillas, soup over it, crafty, and so I was mostly hanging around that sort of station.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
I was talking to my brother.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
If you need to check that alibi, you can call him.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Oh, what's that?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
You can't get a hold of him?

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Weird.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Weird.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
That's so weird.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Just a quick side watch.

09:46.000 --> 09:54.000
Trolls, the film is coming to – it'll be on on-demand stuff I think this week, January 24th tomorrow.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Apple TV, I know it's going to be there.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Blu-ray I think is the following week.

09:58.000 --> 10:08.000
I'm very, very excited because it'll finally be the end of my daughter wanting to watch the Trolls movie and it not being available.

10:08.000 --> 10:16.000
Watching the most batshit content on YouTube is fucking so crazy right now.

10:16.000 --> 10:26.000
I don't know if you guys have gotten – if you search for Trolls toys, which is normally what we end up going with, there's short films about –

10:26.000 --> 10:36.000
I know I've talked about weird YouTube before, but kids weird – there was one where the Trolls toys had all their heads pulled off

10:36.000 --> 10:44.000
and then their heads were hidden underneath other toys that had to be opened by this giant pair of hands on screen

10:44.000 --> 10:51.000
and then the heads had to be reconnected and then there was another one where Branch and Poppy got married and then Poppy got pregnant

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
and it was just like a short film about that for kids.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
It's pretty wild out there on YouTube, y'all.

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
If you haven't been out there, but that – my hell will come to an end where I can finally just enjoy the film.

11:03.000 --> 11:09.000
I saw it two times in the theaters, but now I'm like finally going to be able to just enjoy the story of Branch

11:09.000 --> 11:19.000
and him finding joy in his heart again on Apple TV when I purchase that film tomorrow, January 24th.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
And then you're just three days away from A Dog's Purpose coming out.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
So how's your cinematic week?

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
It's going to be a very good cinematic week.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
Guys, Star Wars just now, while we're recording this, just announced the name of the new movie.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
It's Star Wars Episode VIII, The Last Jedi, which I very much doubt that.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
There will probably be a few more of those – those magic space warriors.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Is it really called that? Is that a joke?

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
The Last Jedi. I'm the last Jedi. Really? Because there's two of you.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
No, it's – the movie ended and there were two of you. No, but I'm the last one.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
I don't believe that one.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
I don't believe it.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
I don't believe it.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
Number nine's going to be like, just kidding, here's six more Jedis.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
Man, it's so rare we get to do breaking news on the program.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
Oh, it's so nice to be able to bust out some entertainment news.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Travis, you've gone silent for a while.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
You're just sort of contemplating, what, Trolls, Dog's Purpose, Star Wars VIII?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
There's so many different things you could be thinking about right now.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Well, I'll tell you the truth.

12:13.000 --> 12:19.000
While Justin was describing his weird YouTube wormhole, my brain broke a little bit,

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
and I thought, like, I must have dropped out of the call or something,

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
because I just – I couldn't understand the words he was saying.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Yeah.

12:26.000 --> 12:32.000
Yeah, it's – if you Google Trolls toys and then hold on for the ride of your life,

12:32.000 --> 12:39.000
and it's all toy videos on YouTube, are absolutely madness.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Yeah.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
There's a video called Branch and Poppy Kiss.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
Oh, a lot of people are waiting for that.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
With real people as the trolls, it's nine minutes – it's nine minutes long.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
Oh, it's just a really long smooch then.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
What could be happening for nine minutes in this film?

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
How much story development is happening in here?

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
You know what?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Here.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Just for a second.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Just for a second.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
No.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
Well, this isn't going to be good for anybody, Juice.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
I just dropped it in the Skype chat.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Just for a second.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
If you guys could just, like – this is my –

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Oh, wow.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
This is actually a lot.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Wow.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
This is a lot to – it's a lot to deal with if you Google Trolls Poppy and Branch Kiss on YouTube.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
So right now I'm looking at a man, and he's doing Green Face,

13:19.000 --> 13:25.000
and he's got some blue Goku hair, and it's just a lot of –

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
well, a lot of build up to the kiss.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
I'm kind of hopping around, kind of scrabbling through this video.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
This shit has four million over –

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
That's the worst thing we're done.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
We're done with.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
It's over, Johnny.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
We've got to stop.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
We've got to do questions.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
We've got to do advice.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
We've got to do questions and advice.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
What is that?

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Yeah.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Nobody can see this.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
It's probably a Bergen.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
The Bergens eat the trolls to be happy.

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
So listen, it's pretty crazy out there on YouTube right now.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
People are putting lots of videos up on YouTube right now.

13:56.000 --> 14:02.000
I was on it the other day, and I watched the first season of Bug Juice is all on there.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Yeah.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
So get at me.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
And you can also watch Branch and Poppy French Kiss for 38 minutes.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
It's been 15 minutes.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
We've got to do the damn thing.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
Brothers, I have recently learned a terrifying truth.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
I've been in this relationship for about too much.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
Too much indeed.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
And I just found out that my girlfriend sometimes drinks milk in the shower.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
Okay.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Okay.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Okay.

14:29.000 --> 14:34.000
At first I was slightly apprehensive, but I assumed it was out of a personal bottle or something.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
Then I learned that it was in fact out of an open glass with no lid.

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
She insists this is perfectly acceptable, but it's an utterly horrifying concept to me.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Am I good?

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
And that's from Not A Milk Drinker in Massachusetts.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Okay.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Mmm.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
How busy are you, huh?

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Yeah.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
I have so many things on my to-do list, I have to combine some of them.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
Yeah, I have to drink some milk and take a shower.

14:58.000 --> 15:04.000
Of all the activities to combine, that is by far the least convenient.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
So this would the – okay.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
The personal bottle is like weird to me.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
I guess you mean a personal bottle of milk, not like a baba.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Okay.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
That makes sense.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Sorry, guys.

15:16.000 --> 15:22.000
Or just like your aluminum special bottle that you refill with milk for the shower times.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Yeah.

15:23.000 --> 15:28.000
The thought of drinking milk and then a little bit of water getting in there is no good.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
I don't like that even a little bit.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
I don't like the thought of drinking milk because I'm pretty lactose intolerant,

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
and then I would be drinking milk on the toilet, and then that's a never-ending cycle.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
I would be in the bathroom all day just dealing with all these milk problems that I've given myself.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
But the thought of drinking a big glass of milk and then you turn around weird,

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
and then like a little bit of hot water gets in the milk, bad.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Now that is how they make skim milk.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
They just add hot water to milk?

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Yeah.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
They add hot shower water.

15:57.000 --> 16:05.000
Hot shower water and a little bit of head and shoulders, a little bit of Irish spring in there.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
I don't think you should do that.

16:08.000 --> 16:14.000
I don't think that that should be done in society that we're in now because I just don't understand.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
But you know-

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
But you know, Zag, I would like to zag for a second.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Oh, shit.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Okay, zag on him.

16:19.000 --> 16:29.000
If this is what your girlfriend does to just like chill, if this is like her me time is a little shower milk, it ain't hurting nobody.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
This isn't taking anything away from you.

16:31.000 --> 16:42.000
This might like her, you know, frosty glass of shower milk might be the only time she gets in her day to really just like treat herself to some shower milk.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
You know what I do?

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Yeah.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
You know what I do?

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
What's that?

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
I would drink some of that shower milk, some of that frosty shower milk just to get the buzz going.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
And then when I was sick of drinking the milk or when my stomach started hurting immediately,

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
as soon as it crossed the threshold of my diaphragms and stuff, all my flanges and stuff,

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
as soon as it crosses that and it hits my stomach lining and my guts go all rotten,

17:03.000 --> 17:10.000
as soon as I was done drinking it, I would just dump it on myself and get that baby soft milk skin.

17:10.000 --> 17:16.000
And maybe that's, you know, you drink it and you drink it down to halfway and you're like, I'm sick.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
And then you dump it on your body and you get that baby soft milk skin.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Yeah.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
Is she just looking to extend the shower maybe?

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
Just like she really loves shower time, but she – okay, okay, wait.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
This has just occurred to me.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
You need your hands in there.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Listen.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
You need your hands in there.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
You can't have one hand constantly on milk duty.

17:39.000 --> 17:46.000
How do you squeeze the Irish spring into the loofah if you have one hand holding your milk?

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
I mean, maybe you got a cup holder in there.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Maybe it's a custom job.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Oh, nice.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
You know what?

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
That is a good gift though.

17:53.000 --> 18:00.000
Good gift idea, a shower cup holder, if you can find one of those on Amazon or something.

18:00.000 --> 18:08.000
That's a good gift because it doesn't just say, here's a cup for your shower milk.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Right.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
It also says like, I accept you.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
You know what I mean?

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Like, I accept you.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
I have a Yahoo here.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Can I read it?

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Yes.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
And whoa, Yahoo, giving me a banner advertisement for Shondaland.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Hello.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
It's a real thing.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
Guys, Yahoo's advertising a thing that I could go and watch and consume.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
It's not telling me about Melissa McCarthy or Ellen DeGeneres' recent death.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
Things are turning around.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Very exciting.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Okay.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
This one was sent in by Morgan Davey.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Keep it wavy, Morgan Davey.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Thank you.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Now it's rooms to go.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
God, Altaba's really taken off.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Maybe I should give Altaba a chance.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user, they're anonymous.

18:50.000 --> 18:57.000
Jefferson asks, help, how to properly get rid of a Ouija board.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Ouija?

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
A lot of people say Ouija, and that doesn't, it's not.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
It can't be, right?

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
It's Elijah.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Elijah.

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
I have had nothing but bad luck with this paper, paper board I printed.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
And I'm tired of it.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
I just want to move on and not think about the paranormal anymore.

19:16.000 --> 19:24.000
It's been telling me to kill by someone named Zozo I've been lied to by something named Kelly or Nancy.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
That's a bad board you got, dude.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
Kill by someone named Zozo or I've been lied to by someone named Kelly or Nancy.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
How to properly get rid of this thing.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
I want it out of my life.

19:34.000 --> 19:41.000
Oh, and please, don't tell me that Ouija boards are fake because I had it turn off the light in my house.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
So don't say it's fake because it's real.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Whoa, what?

19:44.000 --> 19:50.000
Hey, hey, hey, if you think it's fake because you haven't tried it using it hard enough or you're just too wussy to try it.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
So tell me how to get rid of this thing.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
So important.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
Is your Ouija board hooked up to your Echo diet?

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Yeah.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
Your Elijah board has smart home technology inside of it.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
It's the internet of Ouija.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Finally a smart board.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Because it's 2017.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Your Ouija board should be smart.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
Listen, can we drill down on one question?

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I've been lied to by what?

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Kelly or Nancy.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Kelly or Nancy.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
What?

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Exactly.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
It's telling me to kill by someone named Zozo, so.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Zozo's, okay, I get that.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Yeah.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
When you use, think about the practicalities of using a Ouija board, okay?

20:28.000 --> 20:37.000
Why do you think there are, like, I don't understand how you're differentiating between two entities named Kelly or Nancy.

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
Like, why would you think that's the same person that's just maybe going by Kelly or maybe going by Nancy?

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
It says, Justin, I'll tell you the problem here, Justin.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
The question asker assumes that they have a faulty board when I think they have a faulty ghost.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
And you're like, hey, ghost, who killed you?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
And the ghost is like, I don't know.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Kelly?

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Nancy?

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
Who can you even tell?

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Nancy?

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
Maybe all the spirit said is it's a woman's name and it ends in a Y.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Yeah.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
So just like.

21:03.000 --> 21:10.000
It's K-E-L-L-Y, wait, N-A-H, hold up.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Okay.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Maybe their name is like Mary Sue, but it's Kelly Nancy.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Yeah, damn it.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
My name is Kelly Nancy and I want you to kill people.

21:17.000 --> 21:24.000
Now, Yahoo Answers user Dr. NG says, since it's a paper Ouija, it's not a genuine Hasbro Ouija.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
It is worthless.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
It wasn't made by the Hasbro witches.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
The Hasbro necromancers.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
Had you not been a cheapo and bought yourself a proper G-H-O at any fine toy store?

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
No fucking clue what that means.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
You could have donated.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
Genuine Hasbro Ouija.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Probably.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Yeah.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
You could have donated it to Goodwill.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
As a game, it's good for a $2 tax deduction if you itemize your tax.

21:46.000 --> 21:53.000
Now, listen, Kevin, taxes all look good.

21:53.000 --> 22:01.000
I do want to ask you about this one charitable donation of a, it says here a Ouija board, $2 donation of a Ouija board.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Is that correct?

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
It was a G-H-O, Tom.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
I don't know what to tell you.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
It was a G-H-O.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
It was a genuine article, babe.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Oh, Jesus.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
That's definitely this person's concern.

22:12.000 --> 22:17.000
How do I get rid of my printed paper Ouija board while also saving myself some scratch?

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Excuse me, gentlemen.

22:18.000 --> 22:27.000
I, by Googling G-H-O Ouija board, have stumbled on an article called warning signs of Zozo, the Ouija board demon.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
Oh, that's no good.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
Oh, well, this is probably a fucking, this is probably the movie, isn't it?

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
This is probably the movie.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
I think there's probably the movie How to Zozo, I bet.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
Here are some signs you may be in contact with Zozo.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Ah, geez.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Below, now our podcast is haunted, by the way.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Great.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
Below is a list of items that may indicate you are in contact with Zozo during a spirit communication session.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
I don't want to be in contact with Zozo.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Damn it.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Hang up, Zozo.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Hang up, Zozo.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Get out of here.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Hey, put Smoove back on.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Put Smoove on the line.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Put Smoove back on.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
I miss Smoove.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Get out of here, Zozo.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
Rapid figure eight movements of the planchette.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
Rainbow side to side movements of the planchette.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
If the planchette spells out Zozo, Zaza, Mama, Oz.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Papa, beep beep, ding ding.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
Or Ajo, Ding Dong, Bobo.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Oh, damn it, guys.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
It said ding ding.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Zozo's here.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Why didn't you just come ding ding?

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
That's mean.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Okay, wait a minute.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
What if you're, so it spells out all these things.

23:24.000 --> 23:30.000
What if you're not in touch with a demon, but rather are in touch with the ghost of Scatman, uh, the Scatman?

23:30.000 --> 23:38.000
Zozo, Zaza, Mama, Oz, Abacus, Zozo, Zozo, Zaza, Mama, Mama, Oz, Zozo, Abacus, I'm the Scatman.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Crevans.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
Zozo, Zaza, Mama, Oz, Abacus, Zozo, Zaza, Mama.

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
Figure eight movements, rainbow shape.

23:47.000 --> 23:51.000
Shake your planchette all over the place.

23:51.000 --> 23:55.000
We gotta destroy the Ouija, though, because we can't have a Jumanji situation.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
Although, now that I'm thinking about it, that's not what that is.

23:58.000 --> 24:03.000
I'm thinking of the mask, where they tried to destroy the mask, but it kept coming back.

24:03.000 --> 24:09.000
If they printed off their own Ouija, where did they get the planchette from?

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
I don't know, Travis, that's a fine question.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
Probably made it from a jelly jar and saran wrap, if I had to guess.

24:15.000 --> 24:24.000
I'm just saying, like, we should diagnose, though, like, if your computer's broken, if your computer is inhabited by Zozo, you don't just assume it's something.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
You run through some diagnosis.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
I'm just saying, maybe the problem is not the board, but in fact the planchette.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
The Cate Blanchette, you know what I mean?

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Like, maybe that's the problem.

24:32.000 --> 24:40.000
It's entirely possible, but we're all dancing around the bullshit of how to destroy a genuine Ouija.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
It's not, though.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
It's not a genuine Griffin.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
You're right.

24:43.000 --> 24:51.000
It's not a genuine Ouija, so this person's just making shit up, and they don't have Zozo, you're fine, put it in the garbage disposal, flush your stupid paper Ouija down the toilet.

24:51.000 --> 25:02.000
Now, if I had a genuine GHO, and this thing was ruined with Zozo, nasty with Zozo, dripping with Zozo's ichor, what do I do about him?

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
You gotta bury it under your local shoe factory.

25:05.000 --> 25:12.000
One thing that this website recommends is that you set boundaries before you start any spirit communication.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
What?

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
Yeah, it's important to set boundaries with ghosts and these demons that you may be communicating with.

25:17.000 --> 25:23.000
Hey, so that wouldn't be a very good demon, huh?

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
If you have a safe word that it respects.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
That's not really what I think of with a demon.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
Like, oh, okay, no, no, no, I'm sorry.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
I'm sorry, you're right.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
I crossed the line.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
That was too far.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
That was on me.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
I get it.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
You know what I mean?

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
Thank you for communicating with me instead of just being mad and not telling me why.

25:41.000 --> 25:48.000
Instead of at me, I statement, I am a demon, I want to eat your soul.

25:48.000 --> 26:00.000
Do you think after the Ouija movie came out that the rate of Ouija usage across the country spiked or diminished?

26:00.000 --> 26:06.000
Do you think that kids saw the Ouija movie and said, I don't want to fuck with Zozo, and so they did not buy a Ouija board?

26:06.000 --> 26:12.000
Because you know Hasbro probably pushed, very much so like they did with Trolls when Trolls came out.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
They were like, here's new Trolls.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
I bet they started printing Ouija boards again to time it with the release of the movie.

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
But that puts themselves in a weird situation where it's like, it's a Ouija board.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
And then you're like, oh, sick.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
And you see the movie and the kids get killed by Zozo probably.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
And then you think like, this is not a good advertisement.

26:28.000 --> 26:36.000
It's not if like in the Coca-Cola polar bear commercials, if a child came up to try to get some Coca-Cola and the polar bear fucking killed them.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
That would make you think like, maybe I don't want Coca-Cola.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
So do you think people are using these things more or less?

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
Well, I know to speak for myself, Griffin, just using I statements here.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
I have not stopped playing battleships since I saw that fucking flick.

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
So I would think that probably it's the same deal where like you just get the fever, you know?

26:53.000 --> 26:59.000
Do you think if you saw when the year after Jumanji came out and swept the nation with David Alan Grier fever, with dag fever.

26:59.000 --> 27:06.000
Do you think that if you were a small child the year after that movie came out and you loved that movie so much.

27:06.000 --> 27:12.000
And you found an old mysterious board game that you would fucking play it.

27:12.000 --> 27:17.000
Because I think I still would be like, I know this is going to like really be taxing on David Alan Grier.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
But I kind of want to know what the adventure is.

27:20.000 --> 27:26.000
It's an old wooden box in your grandma's cupboard.

27:26.000 --> 27:32.000
And it says like, tropical adventure on it.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
And you're like, I think I'd like to find out.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
And there is like a faint drumming noise coming from the box.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
And you just saw Jumanji.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
Would you still crack that lid and roll those bones?

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Hell yes.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
No question.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
I played Jumanji in a heartbeat if given the opportunity.

27:46.000 --> 27:53.000
Do you think the Zathura kids saw Jumanji and when they saw the Zathura box they were like,

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
this is going to take us on a deadly space adventure but fuck it man.

27:56.000 --> 28:01.000
It didn't work out so great for David Alan Grier but I really want to check out the Zathura game.

28:01.000 --> 28:08.000
Are you aware that Ouija the movie was produced by Hasbro Studios?

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Yeah.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Is there?

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
It kills people.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
Yeah.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Like this isn't a film.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Come buy our game.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Come buy our game.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
It'll kill your kids with Zozo.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
Merry Christmas.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
I got you a Ouija.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
I want you dead you dirty fucking rat.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Perfect.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Print it.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
Send it to theaters.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
You nasty fucking nephew.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
I got you a Ouija board.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
I hope Zozo chokes the life out of you you nasty nephew.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
It does strike me.

28:34.000 --> 28:39.000
I keep thinking about the Ouija board and it's weird because it's very singular to me.

28:39.000 --> 28:45.000
I can't think of another board game that is sold that's like enjoy playing Monopoly

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
but also when you play it you're making real money.

28:48.000 --> 28:55.000
Like there's not really another board game that has a deeper layer of like sales pitch to it.

28:55.000 --> 28:59.000
Like the Ouija is a fun party game and also you're contacting Satan.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
Like that's such a weird and people are like that's fun.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Like you can buy it at Target.

29:04.000 --> 29:12.000
Yeah like when you pop the Pop-O-Matic popper in Sorry they don't try to convince you the dice are alive.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Yeah.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
It's really shaking those pieces of shit up.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Be careful playing the game of life.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
Like you've got real babies now.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
The game of death.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
I hope your mousetrap works.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Those little rats have the plague.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
They don't really.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
It's just such a fucked up sales pitch.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Buy our game.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
It might kill you.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
I mean you could play Grape Escape with real grapes I guess.

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
I was going to juggle with that but you could do that.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
You don't have to make them take them to the factory and smash them in another history.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
You could just like get some grapes and play Grape Escape with real girls.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
You might actually be worried about waking daddy.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
Yeah.

29:48.000 --> 29:58.000
You could wake daddy so hard that your daddy in fact wakes up because the game got so overzealous.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
That's possible.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
That one could happen.

30:00.000 --> 30:04.000
I mean you could actually put a goat on the roof when you're playing a game of Hey Pa.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
There's a goat on the roof.

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
An actual board game that Hasbro made in 1966.

30:09.000 --> 30:15.000
Do you think that anybody was ever playing 13 Dead End Drive and then a painting fell off their mantle and killed them?

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Like was that...

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Statistically speaking, yes.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
Yes.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Probably.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Everything has happened once.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Well, gentlemen, why don't you follow me?

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Get in my back seat.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
We're going to the money zone together.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Let's go.

30:27.000 --> 30:40.000

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
It's a dog's purpose and we did that one.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
Our second sponsor is Squarespace.

So, if you go to johnmalkovich.com, it's a Squarespace site where he has designed clothes and it's amazing and the whole thing is incredible.

And thank you, Squarespace, by the way, because I didn't know I needed John Malkovich fashions in my life, but I do.

We should ZipRecruit?

33:16.000 --> 33:24.000
Yeah, we should ZipRecruit like a hype person or a social media person or like a personal chef.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
What's Flavor Flav doing?

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
He could hype us.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
He's probably good on money.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Well, hold on.

33:32.000 --> 33:36.000
I have a Jumbotron message here and it's for Bryce slash Calvin and Mackenzie.

33:36.000 --> 33:45.000
This message is from the podcast interest subset of the Slack subset of the acapella subset of the Glee Club,

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
who say, I owe brothers.

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
Please help us congratulate Bryce, Calvin, and Mackenzie on their engagement.

33:52.000 --> 33:58.000
They are both huge fans and it would be an honor if you could bestow a choice wedding hashtag upon them.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
God, I couldn't do this for my own fucking nuptials.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
I don't know why I think I could do it for Bryce, Calvin, and Mackenzie.

34:04.000 --> 34:08.000
Three names, two hearts.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Bryce Calmac.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Bryce Calmac.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
Bryce Calmac, the planet the elf was from.

34:15.000 --> 34:21.000
Hashtag a very elf wedding.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Yep, there it is.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Hashtag a very elf wedding.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Hope that helps.

34:27.000 --> 34:33.000
This message is for heads and it's from big R.

34:33.000 --> 34:39.000
And big R says, I know this way late or early by now.

34:39.000 --> 34:46.000
So let's just say it's both a happy birthday and Merry Christmas from your best friend and biggest boy.

34:46.000 --> 34:53.000
You've been the best part of my life for the last two years and now that we'll be living together by the time this is read,

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
I can't wait to share every night and morning with you.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Hit me on my mobile.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
That's sweet.

34:59.000 --> 35:06.000
It's sweet, but like it seems like we missed the time window so badly that not only might you not be living together,

35:06.000 --> 35:12.000
you may have like died of old age in each other's arms notebook style at this point.

35:12.000 --> 35:17.000
And we apologize for, we're just, we got a lot of plates we're spending right now.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Merry Christmas though.

35:19.000 --> 35:24.000
But here's the thing, since we just opened up that new flood of like buying things,

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
we could have just done this so super early.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
That's possible.

35:27.000 --> 35:35.000
Like maybe big R bought this thinking like it won't do this till 2018 and here we are knocking it out in like January.

35:35.000 --> 36:01.000
Yeah.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
Um, let's do a question.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
Here comes.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
Strap in.

36:11.000 --> 36:17.000
I'm leaving my job and have no interest in going out to drinks or having dinner with the people I currently work with to celebrate.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
It's in quotes or say goodbye.

36:19.000 --> 36:24.000
How do I make a graceful exit without having to spend social time with people who I don't like?

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
That's from moving on in Maryland.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
This seems kind of like an open shut case, right?

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
I've never accidentally hung out with people.

36:33.000 --> 36:41.000
I guess if I get stuck in an elevator, maybe, and somebody's got a bottle of bubbly, maybe, maybe then, but that's never happened.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
I don't think this is a tough one, right?

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Just don't.

36:44.000 --> 36:54.000
This is why we need like valets and, um, you know, like a steward that can just sort of announce your non-presence at an event.

36:54.000 --> 36:59.000
I regret to inform you, Griffin McElroy has milk-based diarrhea again.

36:59.000 --> 37:06.000
Godji Godine, he says, here's a roast he made for you.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
Just kidding, I made it.

37:07.000 --> 37:14.000
You can have a cake, cake with your face on it, but you're not there, but the cake with your face on it is.

37:14.000 --> 37:20.000
So they could sort of ceremonially say goodbye, but like not in a way that you have to participate with.

37:20.000 --> 37:24.000
Yeah, they can all eat your face and talk about their favorite Gregory memories.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
I have an idea.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
Okay.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
I've been thinking about this.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
Feels like a bad one.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
Well, hold on.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
Justin?

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
No, Justin's right.

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
Sometimes there's just something in the air where I can tell you're about to float a real stick group.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
Just give it a moment.

37:37.000 --> 37:48.000
Maybe what you do is like maybe a week before your last day, you just kind of like spread around the office that you've decided to take like a surprise trip.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
You're going to treat yourself.

37:49.000 --> 37:55.000
You're taking a weekend getaway to like Columbia, and then you just don't come back to work.

37:55.000 --> 38:06.000
And then slowly over time, perhaps a myth will develop that either you've just decided to live in Columbia from now on, or like maybe they need to start planning like a rescue mission.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Yeah.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
Okay.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
I'm just saying maybe leave – I'm saying leave a little mystery.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
Just a mystery, sure.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Leave just a story.

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
Let the myth you leave behind be bigger than yourself.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
You know what I mean?

38:18.000 --> 38:24.000
It is important though that you alert the authorities ahead of time that this is happening.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Oh, this is going to have to go deep.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
This is going to have to go all the way to the top.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
You know what I mean?

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
Yeah.

38:30.000 --> 38:48.000
I saw a trailer for A Dog's Purpose, and it taught me a lesson, and I won't see the film, but it taught me a lesson about like spending time with just people in this world, or dogs,

38:48.000 --> 38:56.000
because you never know which one of them harbors the soul of a kindred lost spirit.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
You know what I mean?

38:57.000 --> 39:04.000
So like you don't know which one of your coworkers used to be another one of your coworkers that died, but you really liked that coworker.

39:04.000 --> 39:10.000
All I'm saying is A Dog's Purpose taught me to just really value the important things in life, like human connections and also dog connections.

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
So I just want you to think about that before you just shut all these people out.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
That's true.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
What if you miss them?

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
What if you miss them?

39:18.000 --> 39:26.000
Maybe that last day, this is the kind of setting someone would make for like a movie where it's like your last day at work and you've hated everybody,

39:26.000 --> 39:37.000
and it wasn't until this moment that you've really come to appreciate what you never took advantage of in these people's lives and the stories that they had and the impact that they could have on your life.

39:37.000 --> 39:50.000
Maybe this last 24 hours could be your hit film Fist Fight, which I also have not seen, but I assume it's about Charlie Day and Ice Cube learning to appreciate each other as people and not fighting?

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
I don't know.

39:51.000 --> 39:56.000
Like I said, I've only seen muted previews on Facebook and Twitter.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Right.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
But I assume that's what it's about.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
Or Here Comes the Boom?

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
It could be Here Comes the Boom.

40:02.000 --> 40:08.000
What I'm saying is that your boss could be your dog that died a while ago, so fucking show some respect.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Your dog could be your boss that died a while ago.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
You don't know.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
You don't know.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
That's what I'm saying.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
That's what this life has taught me, this movie, this wonderful film.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
I got a Yahoo here.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
It's sent in by Mario Panagetti.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
Thank you, Mario.

40:19.000 --> 40:26.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Kay who asks, what would you name five sons?

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
What would you name five sons all born two years apart?

40:30.000 --> 40:38.000
Not yous, Hubert, Jeremy, Beckett, Devin, Jack, Ryan, Clinton, Fred.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
I'm sorry, what?

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
So you know.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
What would you name five sons?

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
You know you're going to have five sons.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
Uh-huh.

40:43.000 --> 40:48.000
Like my plan, we're going to get to five any way we need to.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
We will have five sons.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
Okay.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
So you have that in mind.

40:51.000 --> 40:56.000
So you come up with a naming structure for your five sons ahead of time.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
What would you?

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
Here's mine.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
Okay.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
It will happen Friday.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
Exactly.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Now you're thinking about it.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
Okay.

41:08.000 --> 41:12.000
It's a lot of work to go through and also a lot of work for these five boys to go through.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
All right.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
Let me hit you with this.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
What happened to Ross?

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
Where's Ross though?

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
The dad's name is Ross.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
And the mom's name is Gunther.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
Okay.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
And the grandpa's name is Friends.

41:28.000 --> 41:33.000
And this is our dog, Central Perk.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
I didn't think about this.

41:34.000 --> 41:38.000
When I have my one son, what if I have four more sons?

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
Yeah.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
You got to have a theme going.

41:40.000 --> 41:48.000
Can I do like Sonic the Hedgehog, Tails the Fox, Knuckles the Echidna, Big the Cat, Cream

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
the Rabbit?

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
All Sonic characters.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
Fuck yeah.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
Got it.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
I got one.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
George Foreman did a good one.

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
Yes, George Foreman had a fun time with his son names.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
You couldn't do that again, huh?

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
No.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
Like you couldn't.

42:02.000 --> 42:06.000
It's pretty wonderful that he did it, but I'm not sure you could keep doing it.

42:06.000 --> 42:12.000
What if you named it after a single word NBC hit sitcom?

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
So, Frasier.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
Mm-hmm.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
Cheers.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
Mm-hmm.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
This is my son, Coach.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
This is my son, Wings.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
This is my son, Wings.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Hello, I'm Wings.

42:25.000 --> 42:30.000
I'm a three years old, and I am Wings.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Hello, I am Wings.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
Hello, I am Coach.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
I'm older than Wings.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
I love you, big brother.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
I love you, Wings.

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
What if you named your sons like five professions?

42:41.000 --> 42:47.000
Or like you named, so for example, your son Wings, you trained from birth to become a

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
pilot.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
You know what I mean?

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
Okay, and Cheers would be a cheerleader.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
Yeah.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
Frasier would be somebody who repaired Frasiers.

42:56.000 --> 43:02.000
Yeah, it looks like I got a little bit of cracks in your Frasier.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
I can take care of that for you.

43:04.000 --> 43:08.000
You got to take that to... I'm a skilled Frasier, so I should be able to fix that one right

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
up for you.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
Not going to be cheap, though.

43:10.000 --> 43:16.000
Frasier like that, it's going to be in the four figure range, sorry to say.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
That's a solid oak Frasier.

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
Never see those anymore.

43:21.000 --> 43:26.000
Okay, the Kevin and the Furious, two Kevin, two Furious.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
Oh my God.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
The Kevin and the Furious took your drift.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
Yes.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Kevin and Furious, fast Kevin.

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
Two Kevin.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
From Kelly.

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
Two Kevin from Kevin.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Fuck, that's really good, Justin.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
You nailed it.

43:43.000 --> 43:48.000
That's good, because then if you accidentally bone down and you crank out a couple more

43:48.000 --> 43:53.000
calves, three more calves, the fate of the Kevin.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
No, now the Kevin of the Furious.

43:55.000 --> 44:06.000
The hard thing is going to be somehow naming Kevin, Kevin Drift, but having him come after

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
all the others.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
Your third son will actually be your fifth son.

44:10.000 --> 44:14.000
I have to rearrange these names just to get the naming conventions right.

44:14.000 --> 44:19.000
Can I say how amazing it is that through all the really semi-terrible names, and they're

44:19.000 --> 44:25.000
fun in a terrible way, or they're terrible in a fun way, either way, the Fast and Furious

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
films all have really bad names.

44:27.000 --> 44:32.000
The fact that they've all been building to what may be the best name for a movie ever,

44:32.000 --> 44:38.000
the fate of the Furious, which is so fucking cool of a name of a movie.

44:38.000 --> 44:43.000
The fact that they managed to pull that out towards the end is pretty outstanding.

44:43.000 --> 44:49.000
I just, I'm so excited, and I'm so hurt by what Vin has done.

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
And I know it's not him, I know he's playing a character, but I don't think I'll ever be

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
able to look at him the same way again.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Yeah, it's a pretty big deal.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
How about a new question?

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Family comes first, right?

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Always, it's supposed to, so what the fuck's he doing?

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
What's he doing right now?

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
He's kissing Charlize, why?

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
Why?

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
That's not who he's supposed to kiss.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
She's not family.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
She isn't family.

45:10.000 --> 45:13.000
He should only be kissing family.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
You know it's him because there's still cars.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
Yeah.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
He's still driving faster with him.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
It's not some sort of android.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
I thought that too, Justin.

45:20.000 --> 45:24.000
I watched the trailer, and I was like, this is some sort of clone or cyber android or robot

45:24.000 --> 45:29.000
or CGI hologram like they did with Michael Jackson in that one concert.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
I think it's got to be a hologram, right?

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
It's really him because it's the cars.

45:33.000 --> 45:39.000
I thought maybe it was a Dave situation where it's somebody who looks like him and impersonates

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
him that has to take over for him.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
Shit.

45:41.000 --> 45:45.000
Or maybe a meet Dave situation where it's like a big guy with a bunch of little guys

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
inside of him, but it would be another possibility.

45:48.000 --> 45:52.000
But no, it's him because it's him, and he's saying all this right stuff, and he's driving

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
the cars, and he's hurting his family.

45:54.000 --> 46:00.000
Wouldn't it be incredible if at the end of the new XXX movie Tyrese rolled up in just

46:00.000 --> 46:07.000
like a super sick sports car and was like, hey, we need you back in the Fast and the

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
Furious movies.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
We've got a whole new bad guy to fight.

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
And XXX was like, guess I better go beat Dom now.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
And hopped in the car.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
Oh, I see.

46:15.000 --> 46:20.000
And then the new Fast and the Furious movie starts with Tyrese and then pulling up in

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
that car.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
Oh, God.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
And that's the start of that movie.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
But unfortunately, they can't get it.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Justin just had a very, very powerful orgasm.

46:27.000 --> 46:32.000
A Fast and the Furious crossover with XXX where Vin Diesel is both.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
I can't take it.

46:33.000 --> 46:37.000
I'll tell you when they're going to get there, though, it's going to be Fast and the Furious

46:37.000 --> 46:42.000
30 because then they just put XXX right there at the end of it and there's your fucking

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
title.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Oh, hell yes.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
We've got a lot of Fast and the Furious movies.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
Got to make them fast for us.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
Got to speed up.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
And Furious-er.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
Yeah.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
It's going to be Fast 9 feeling fine.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
It's going to be the next one.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
That one's going to be a more upbeat one.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
Maybe Fast 10.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
Do it again.

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
Maybe some web exclusive entries.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Only on Netflix.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
The dirty Fast and Furious dozen.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
We're going to get there.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
Yeah.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
Ocean's Fast 11.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
Yeah.

47:09.000 --> 47:13.000
Maybe one could just be a murder mystery for like a weekend and that's like another one

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
just like covered.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
We just got to rush through them is what I'm saying.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
20 through 26 is an ARG experience.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
Yeah.

47:19.000 --> 47:23.000
Number 27 could just be an escape room somewhere in Los Angeles.

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
All canonical.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
All canonical.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
All canonical.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
What happened?

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
Ludacris dies in the escape room.

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
Ludacris died in the escape room and he's not in the movies.

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
Yeah.

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
You had to go to the escape room.

47:35.000 --> 47:40.000
It's a great crossover and all the plotlines are unintelligible.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Yo, I can't help you guys with this one.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
One of my wings is alive again.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
What?

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
What?

47:46.000 --> 47:51.000
Oh, you had to read the choose your own adventure book to understand that one.

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
The angel that lives inside of me is starting to break through.

47:54.000 --> 47:57.000
The angel that lives inside of you?

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
Yeah, that was in the Angry Birds Fast and Furious crossover app.

48:00.000 --> 48:03.000
I hate an angel in the Angry Birds Fast game.

48:03.000 --> 48:08.000
Yo, yo, I'd love to come on this adventure, but Krombulor, the planet inside my heart,

48:08.000 --> 48:14.000
the tiny planet inside my heart can't – it's the dark times because of the Harvest Festival,

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
so I can't make it out for this one.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
We stole the planet from Jason Statham, remember?

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
Remember?

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
When he became Galactus.

48:21.000 --> 48:26.000
It's just you and me, Rocket Raccoon.

48:26.000 --> 48:32.000
Here's another question from a listener.

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
I work at a small coffee shop.

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
It's pretty slow, so I know a lot of people that come in.

48:38.000 --> 48:42.000
I have a good rapport with the customers and often have pleasant and lengthy chats with

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
them.

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
However, I've noticed a trend where some customers have started blatantly shielding

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
their pin numbers from me as they pay with a card.

48:48.000 --> 48:52.000
This offends me because it's rude, sure, but also because they think I would pick such

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
a boring and obsolete way to steal?

48:54.000 --> 48:58.000
This has been happening quite a bit, and I'm wondering what my next move is.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
Do I say something?

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Am I allowed to make a goof?

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
That's from Ocean Zero.

49:04.000 --> 49:08.000
This is so brutal.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
Do you guys do that?

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Do you guys shield your pin?

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
No, I yell it out loud.

49:14.000 --> 49:20.000
Mine's just 69-69, so it's not even that good of a pin.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
You're going to have to catch me and kill me to take my debit card from me.

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
That's the truth.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
It's not enough just to have my secret 69-69 phrase.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
I don't care.

49:30.000 --> 49:35.000
If you steal my debit card, it's going to be canceled by the time you hit the corner.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
It's no good to you.

49:37.000 --> 49:41.000
If somebody did perloid my numbers, which has only happened basically eight or nine

49:41.000 --> 49:51.000
different times, and I have to just buy Russian coffee cups or something, I don't know what

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
I'm doing out there, but I keep getting my numbers stolen.

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
When it does, the bank calls me and is like, hey, J-Man, happened again.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
I'm like, yeah, I know.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
It happens.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
Send me a new card.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
They're like, you know it.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
And I don't care.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
I don't care.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
Steal my pin.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
I don't give a shit.

50:05.000 --> 50:09.000
I saw someone share a video with me on Facebook that's like, when you enter your pin, you

50:09.000 --> 50:16.000
need to put, once you're done, put your whole hand on the pad, or else someone can take

50:16.000 --> 50:22.000
a heat, one of those thermal scanners, and show which buttons are warm.

50:22.000 --> 50:28.000
First of all, if I saw someone do that right after me, it's like, hey, what's that guy

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
doing with that thermal scanner?

50:29.000 --> 50:33.000
But secondly, if you brought your thermal scanner to the coffee shop to steal my pin

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
number, do you need money?

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
I can give you $10.

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
Do you need $10?

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
Just sell the thermal scanner.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
Yeah.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
Yeah.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Where do they get that thermal scanner?

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
Hold on.

50:43.000 --> 50:47.000
This is, don't do this thing.

50:47.000 --> 50:51.000
If I'm having a nice conversation with you, and I'm making you a panini at the Starbucks,

50:51.000 --> 51:00.000
and I hand you your panini, and I say, that'll be $40, and then you try to be sneaky with

51:00.000 --> 51:05.000
your pin, like I'm going to hack you, that hurts my feelings.

51:05.000 --> 51:09.000
I just had a nice conversation about your kids while I made you a panini.

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
I think you should say, well, I think it's fair.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
You didn't see what I did to that panini.

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
You can't watch me make your drink.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
You just have to-

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
Are we all hacking each other all the time now?

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
Because it's not just computers anymore.

51:23.000 --> 51:30.000
The prevalence of hacking has now gone around the bend for me, where it's like, they don't

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
get you.

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
If they want you, they don't get you.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Why not just be chill about it?

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
I don't know.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
If you want me, they're going to get you.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
I'm just not sweating anymore.

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
It's going to happen.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
If they want you, they're going to get you.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
Damn.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
There's got to be a way to put up a cyber wall.

51:48.000 --> 51:49.000
No.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
That's the thing.

51:50.000 --> 51:55.000
What you've got to do, what you've got to do is you've got to make yourself so open to

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
attack that you're low hanging fruit.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
No, I'm not going to hack Travis.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
There's no challenge in that.

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
What is that?

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
A baby could hack Travis.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
Look at that baby over there hacking Travis.

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
It's the Sun Tzu baby boy technique.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
Exactly.

52:09.000 --> 52:13.000
I believe it's in the third Sun Tzu book where he says, just make yourself look like a little

52:13.000 --> 52:18.000
baby and do keep on yourself and then your enemies will see you and say, he's not worth

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
fighting.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
That's the R4-3 Tokyo Drift.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
Right.

52:22.000 --> 52:26.000
Then when they turn around, you fucking hack them.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
Yeah.

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
You hack them.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
You hack them back.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
You back them.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
You counter hack.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
That's what we need to do.

52:32.000 --> 52:39.000
No walls because they're going to break through my fucking ice in the reboot cyberverse.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
I'm just going to have to go in there myself.

52:41.000 --> 52:42.000
I've got to learn how to.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
Maybe that's my zag.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
I've been trying to find out what my zag is going to be for 20 Serpentine and maybe it's

52:47.000 --> 52:54.000
I just become a fucking white hat hacker and I sort of become, yeah.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Let me explain to you why I need that so very badly.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
Okay.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
It is my dream as a child of the 90s.

52:59.000 --> 53:08.000
It is my dream in life to one day see a hacker on hacker computer battle with sweat on their

53:08.000 --> 53:14.000
brow and furious just typing and they're blocking them at every turn.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
You know what I mean?

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
I want to see it like it's a dance.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Like it's a beautiful hacking dance.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
Yeah.

53:21.000 --> 53:27.000
The thing I was led to believe happened all the time by movies in 1992 and I never see

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
it.

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
It doesn't happen that much.

53:29.000 --> 53:36.000
I want it so bad and then it ends and everybody's exhausted but we barely kept the launch codes

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
safe or whatever.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
Yeah.

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
It looks like it was a draw and I'll be like, is it?

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
And then I'll hold up their codes and I'll be like, got your codes.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
Got your codes here.

53:43.000 --> 53:47.000
I want it so bad.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Can I read one more Yahoo real quick?

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
Yeah.

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
You can get one in under the wire.

53:51.000 --> 53:56.000
It's from Rachel Rosen.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
Game recognized game.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
Rachel Rosen.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
Thank you, Rachel.

53:59.000 --> 54:04.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Bernard A. who asks, why did John Hancock write names so big on

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
the Constitution?

54:06.000 --> 54:11.000
Now, there's a quick answer here from David B. who says John Hancock was president of

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
the United States when the Declaration of Independence was adopted and signed according

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
to legend.

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
Hancock signed his name largely and clearly so that King George could read it without

54:17.000 --> 54:21.000
his spectacles but the story is apocryphal and originated years later.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Whatever the reason, it clearly had something to do with emphasis.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
So, I've heard that before.

54:25.000 --> 54:29.000
He signed it so that King George could read it with his stupid bad eyes.

54:29.000 --> 54:34.000
And if that's not the answer, why did my boy John Hancock, when everybody else is like,

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
Jill signed it John Adams.

54:37.000 --> 54:41.000
And then this motherfucker rolls up and he's like, Jonathan Hancock.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
I actually know the reason.

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
I know it.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Well, don't say the real reason.

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
No, no, I know it, Griffin.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Okay, but it won't be funny if he's the real reason.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
No, I know it.

54:49.000 --> 54:54.000
Actually, John Hancock wrote his signature so big to cover up where Ben Franklin wrote,

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
I signed your crack.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
Oh, yeah.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Have a great summer.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
Have a great summer.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
I love you like a sister.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
Ben Franklin.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
Benny F.

55:03.000 --> 55:07.000
And John Hancock was like, Franklin.

55:07.000 --> 55:10.000
He just wanted to cover up.

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
He wanted to try to obscure where Ben Franklin had just written cock.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Some huge letters on there.

55:15.000 --> 55:19.000
It's like, well, we got to do something with this because Benny Franks just wrote cock.

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
What did you write, John Hamm?

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
Don't worry about it.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
Just don't worry about it.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
I'll just change my fucking name.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
It's fine.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
History will never know the difference.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
No one's going to see this shit anyways.

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
You're going to lock this away somewhere, right?

55:32.000 --> 55:37.000
Until Lynn rolls up with the sequel, with the squeakquel, all about the cock man.

55:37.000 --> 55:40.000
There's probably not as rich a vein there.

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
No.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
Very short.

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
What if he had-

55:43.000 --> 55:46.000
Have you seen Hamilton 2, the squeakquel cock man?

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
Cock man?

55:49.000 --> 55:54.000
Instead of talking about how he's going to change the world, it's exactly the same show,

55:54.000 --> 55:58.000
except it's just a young John Hancock talking about how one day he's going to write his name

55:58.000 --> 56:02.000
really big on an important document.

56:02.000 --> 56:12.000
It could be that John Hancock had one regular hand and one Foo Fighters Everlong big hand,

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
and that was his right hand.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
John, please sign it with your left.

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
John, wait.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
Just please use the left.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
No.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
We only get one shot of this.

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
We've had to rewrite this thing so many times.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
Please, John.

56:25.000 --> 56:31.000
Yeah, it's like 1700 or 1800 something, and it's the paper's really hard to come by.

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
Please use your not giant Everlong hand.

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
Paper's so hard to come by, we can't afford calendars.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
We don't even know what year it is.

56:38.000 --> 56:46.000
It is fun to think about the fact that you live a whole life, and in one moment of extravagance,

56:46.000 --> 56:56.000
in one moment of extravagance, you change the whole way in which you are a person.

56:56.000 --> 57:07.000
Through all of history, no matter what you did, father, a brother, son, patriot, politician,

57:07.000 --> 57:12.000
no, you're just the guy who signed his name so big on there.

57:12.000 --> 57:17.000
But in doing so, also, there's a lot of people whose names are on there that people don't talk about much.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
But old John is just like, well.

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
Let's have him talk about Thomas Mifflin or Robert Morris.

57:22.000 --> 57:26.000
They should talk about the rest of those people because the bullshit of all this is John Hancock

57:26.000 --> 57:30.000
wrote his name first, and everyone else went, I'm going to write it smaller than that.

57:30.000 --> 57:36.000
Everyone else could have also, but they made John Hancock the dude in the office who signs

57:36.000 --> 57:41.000
the birthday card first and writes a big long message, and everybody else just writes their name.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
And it's like, well, thanks everybody.

57:43.000 --> 57:48.000
I thought we were all going to go all in on this, and you guys left me just hanging in the wind,

57:48.000 --> 57:52.000
and you all could have written your names big too, but now I look like an asshole.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
Now I look like history's asshole.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Also, I will say this.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
If you haven't looked at the signature in a while, check it out.

57:58.000 --> 58:03.000
If my signature was that fucking rad, it is the fate of the furious of signatures.

58:03.000 --> 58:07.000
If my signature was that cool, I'd probably do it really big too every time.

58:07.000 --> 58:13.000
Also, just one last thing that we do need to address is that John Hancock defo did not sign the Constitution.

58:13.000 --> 58:17.000
He got up on the Declaration of Independence, so we got that one wrong.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
We got that one very wrong.

58:19.000 --> 58:20.000
We were very wrong on that.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.000
Let's just cut that tweet out.

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
Let's cut out the last 20 minutes of this podcast.

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
Go listen to stuff you should know if you want facts.

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
Stuff you should know.

58:28.000 --> 58:32.000
The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are different things.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
They're different stuff.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Two different sheets.

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
Who signed the Constitution real big?

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
Did anybody do that?

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
Yeah, I was just looking at this.

58:41.000 --> 58:47.000
Let's talk about this big signature, and it's from Daniel of St. Thomas Jennifer.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
Who the fuck are you?

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Who gave you the right, Dan?

58:50.000 --> 58:56.000
I think the weirdest part is where somebody just drew Kilroy on the Declaration.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.000
Who did that?

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
You know what I mean?

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Where'd that come from?

59:00.000 --> 59:04.000
Let's wrap up so Justin can go do his jujitsu.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
Excellent.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.000
Taekwondo.

59:06.000 --> 59:07.000
Don't be a dick.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
They're two very different things.

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
I don't know why, but I'm pretty sure they are.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
I'm still early yet.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
That's going to do it for us this week.

59:16.000 --> 59:19.000
My brother, my brother and me, we hope you've enjoyed yourself.

59:19.000 --> 59:22.000
Thank you to this week's sponsors.

59:22.000 --> 59:28.000
If you want to, I think there's a, we don't know specifically, but we're about, well,

59:28.000 --> 59:34.000
we are, as of this moment, exactly one month out from the premiere of my brother, my brother

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
and me TV show on CISO.

59:35.000 --> 59:38.000
So you're going to start seeing things.

59:38.000 --> 59:41.000
Start seeing some things probably this week.

59:41.000 --> 59:46.000
So it'll be on our Facebook group, my brother, my brother and me appreciation group, and

59:46.000 --> 59:50.000
also on our Tweet-O at NBNB AM.

59:50.000 --> 59:55.000
So make sure you follow those so you can see that stuff when it pops off.

59:55.000 --> 59:59.000
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.000
It's a fucking great, powerful tune off a great, powerful album, and you're just going

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
to love it if you haven't listened to it already.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000

I'm going to be on the Jonathan Coulton Cruise.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:40.000
It is March 4th through the 11th, and it's going to be really fun and cool.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Some people that are going to be on there include Jeffrey Cranor, the Welcome to Night Vale

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
folks, Nerf Herder.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Here's one that I just found out about, a relatively new edition that I'm really stoked

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
about, Rebecca Sugar, creator of Steven Universe is going to be on there.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
That's awesome.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Yeah, it is.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
I'm so fucking jealous that you get to go on this.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000
I'm just going to follow her around and just tell her how much I enjoy her program, not

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
in a weird way.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.000
And we're doing a live Sawbones on there, so you're not going to want to miss that.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
In fact, you're going to want to check it totally out.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:20.000
So, Jokocruise.com, there are some cabins still available, so go come with me on the

beautiful Holland America, Westerdam ship that is a boat, probably.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
A boat ship?

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Yeah, it's going to be a pretty good cruise.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Well said.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
I have a Final Yahoo here.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Yes, please.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:42.360
It's by Jeffrey Corbello, and it's by Yahoo Answers user Shrek, who asks, in Back to the

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:49.120
Future 3, since time travel is obviously fake, how did they get back to the olden west to

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.120
film the movie?

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:51.120
It's Justin McElroy.

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.120

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:53.120
