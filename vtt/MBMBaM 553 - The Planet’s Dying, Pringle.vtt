WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:48.380 --> 00:50.380
It's better it's better with you

00:53.980 --> 00:56.060
It's better it's better with you

01:00.340 --> 01:02.340
Better it's better

01:10.900 --> 01:15.580
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me and if I show the modern era

01:15.580 --> 01:22.420
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. Woof woof. That's me chasing my own tail. I'm old dog Travis McElroy

01:22.420 --> 01:27.300
You're his brother. I'm jealous of Travis's thing cuz he's been doing it. Yeah

01:28.260 --> 01:33.140
You ever see those videos? Hey, hey, hey, you ever seen one of them videos on

01:34.500 --> 01:38.300
Facebook where the people share like I took a picture of myself every day for ten years

01:38.460 --> 01:42.180
Yeah, I see that and I'm like fuck that looks cool. I wish I could have done that

01:42.180 --> 01:46.660
But then I think that's too late. I can't you guys you guys lack

01:47.260 --> 01:54.340
Commitment to really anything but let alone bits and that's why if I start doing a bit even if everybody hates it

01:54.340 --> 01:56.340
I'll just keep doing it. You know what I mean?

01:56.460 --> 02:01.700
Yeah, it's a good bit and I'm Griffin McElroy. You could start doing it now Griffin

02:01.700 --> 02:07.060
You know the best time to start doing an intro bit is yesterday and the second best time is today. Damn

02:07.540 --> 02:10.060
That's good shit, except we weren't recording yesterday

02:10.060 --> 02:13.060
So then I would have just weren't then what was I doing?

02:14.140 --> 02:15.420
so

02:15.420 --> 02:17.420
Do we have an intro? I?

02:17.820 --> 02:24.100
Thought we'd just check in as bro. Oh, okay. No, sorry. Mine was more of a faithful. Yeah, I bet

02:25.900 --> 02:27.900
I have to I have to imagine

02:28.140 --> 02:32.940
Otherwise, why did we start recording? There's a you know that kind of deal. There's an emptiness in your heart

02:33.500 --> 02:39.240
There's an emptiness in this in the in our heart and my shit in this show speak on that

02:39.240 --> 02:42.040
Yeah, Griffin folded that impulse. Okay. Well

02:42.960 --> 02:45.920
When we're doing this show we rely on

02:47.400 --> 02:52.800
It on the bit on the bits to sort of float us through the hour, right?

02:54.000 --> 02:55.280
But without the bits

02:55.280 --> 03:02.000
It's just the three of us sort of standing in a big white empty room and it's so bright in here

03:02.000 --> 03:04.800
And it's bright because it's exposing us. We are nude

03:04.800 --> 03:12.280
Because there's no bits to hide our shame behind and there's a there's a huge emptiness here now

03:12.280 --> 03:15.640
I get that Griffin, but maybe that means that this is where we'll do our best work

03:15.640 --> 03:16.920
I think for too long

03:16.920 --> 03:23.680
The three of us have relied literally for the entire length of the show have relied on you know, bits Yahoo answers

03:24.680 --> 03:29.640
Questions having ideas these kinds of things. We've relied on that too heavily

03:29.640 --> 03:32.760
So what if we just did a whole episode where we didn't make any jokes?

03:32.760 --> 03:34.760
We didn't come up with any good ideas

03:35.720 --> 03:41.840
We didn't have any thought starters or anything. We just kind of actually as liberating as that sounds

03:41.840 --> 03:44.880
I feel like we've unintentionally tried that a few times in the last few years

03:44.880 --> 03:50.040
Yeah, and I tried that too and it didn't go good. The response hasn't been great

03:50.040 --> 03:52.800
We did a whole episode about war with grandpa, didn't we?

03:52.880 --> 03:57.480
Yeah, we did do the whole episode about war with grandpa that nobody but that was maximum artifice

03:57.480 --> 04:01.080
So this is the other way around right? Oh, there's a minimum artifice

04:01.080 --> 04:03.080
Yeah, I mean with this

04:03.520 --> 04:08.840
Spring is here. Uh-huh. Shit. Yeah, bud. Now we have all of that. Yeah

04:08.840 --> 04:15.880
Yeah, spring is here and that means one thing around these times this this neck of the woods time for spring cleaning

04:16.320 --> 04:18.000
Okay, I'm gonna get out

04:18.000 --> 04:21.720
Some of the parts of this podcast that are not working. Oh

04:22.200 --> 04:24.200
them out

04:24.200 --> 04:29.320
Dumpster. Yeah, and and you know, I don't know if we want no no there's you don't want to bring in new stuff

04:29.320 --> 04:33.460
Why you're spring cleaning? You just want to clear out some of the cross. Yeah, there's let me see

04:35.040 --> 04:40.960
Let me see. I got one that's I'm just immediately immediately. I'm gonna get one out. Okay, just let me crank it

04:40.960 --> 04:43.060
Let me crank one out gross one

04:43.720 --> 04:45.520
jam

04:45.520 --> 04:50.320
So that was the last one of those they're done. I'm getting rid of in the spring cleaning

04:50.320 --> 04:59.520
I'm getting rid of pretending like I'm ending munch squad. I'm not one squad. I'm getting rid of I'm sunsetting the bit where it's

04:59.920 --> 05:03.960
It's final days. Okay, so net so that that bit is now

05:04.960 --> 05:06.960
retired as they say on

05:07.640 --> 05:09.640
Blank check we're hanging its Jersey

05:10.800 --> 05:13.280
Yeah, me and Travis still make them jokes

05:13.280 --> 05:22.600
About much. No, it's it's done. The continuity is done. Like it's important to reset continuity for our show, right?

05:23.160 --> 05:29.800
So people knew new listeners aren't lost. So that's not a thing anymore. I don't say that sure

05:29.800 --> 05:35.160
I'd like to get rid of something. It's just been bothering me for a while. Yeah the part of the show

05:36.560 --> 05:42.520
And it's kind of like after we've made everything right, but yeah still talk for like another five minutes

05:42.520 --> 05:47.600
Yeah before the I'd so I would like just get rid of the closing interesting

05:47.640 --> 05:50.480
So I just want to end whatever the last thing is

05:50.480 --> 05:55.360
So we say a joke right and we're like Kelsey Grammer's dick and then the mp3 stops

05:57.160 --> 06:00.000
Yeah, no, you know, I think we can leave the silence

06:00.000 --> 06:06.480
Oh so that we don't get people like messaging us late. I think the got cut off right ever, right?

06:06.560 --> 06:08.560
But we just I don't think we need

06:09.280 --> 06:11.600
Closing stuff anymore. Okay, interesting

06:11.600 --> 06:17.480
I'm gonna say this and this is a huge one and may actually be the most difficult one

06:17.960 --> 06:25.080
To actually stick to and I this is not for the boys because I do not think I could muzzle them like this in

06:25.640 --> 06:31.000
Good in good faith, but I am never going to say the word

06:31.880 --> 06:34.720
Frazier again on this Wow

06:34.720 --> 06:41.480
We're sunsetting Frazier and I'll there's a lot of our younger fans who I think are gonna be fully fucking stoked about that

06:41.520 --> 06:44.120
Cuz they don't they don't know who this old

06:45.760 --> 06:50.700
Northwestern fucking nosy Jagoff is his name's phrase

06:51.240 --> 06:56.040
His name is a word. I won't be saying on the show anymore. Yeah

06:56.560 --> 07:02.680
And that's it. And that's it. Hey, can I just say Griffin that people are gonna think that that was a really good edit?

07:02.680 --> 07:09.240
My Rachel right there. No, I caught it. That was just an amazing selfish. Yeah, it was very red and it was not intentional

07:09.240 --> 07:11.240
I fully was about to say that

07:11.240 --> 07:14.280
Northwestern gentleman's name. It sounded like it sounded

07:15.160 --> 07:18.020
Computer clean. Yeah, good. That's all that it was. All right. I

07:18.880 --> 07:24.040
One last thing that I do want to cut from the show. I just want to cut wherever we say the word this

07:24.040 --> 07:30.580
Oh, I don't want to say that word anymore any of them and if we do we'll put a quarter in the jar

07:30.580 --> 07:35.860
Okay, that's gonna rack up pretty fast trap. Yeah, but then we'll spend that on ice cream

07:36.380 --> 07:40.700
Okay, we can keep doing all of our great bits like where we do stuff

07:40.700 --> 07:43.940
That's just for people to use on tik-tok, right that we do all the time

07:43.940 --> 07:49.900
But now you've fucked it up trap the possibly the whole show because now I'm going to be thinking

07:51.180 --> 07:57.820
Constantly for the rest of my life about that word and how I can avoid saying it about this. Yeah

07:57.820 --> 07:59.220
God

07:59.220 --> 08:01.220
Sorry, that's a quarter

08:01.860 --> 08:05.940
One of the things that I've seen a lot of people complain about I'd like to discuss sunsetting is

08:06.820 --> 08:08.820
the very lengthy

08:09.100 --> 08:12.500
Introduction sequences. Oh, they're kind of rambly people complain

08:12.940 --> 08:15.820
Sometimes I've seen this you guys don't believe me, but it's true

08:15.820 --> 08:22.260
I've seen people complain about the fact that we don't do enough questions. Okay, is that I I'm not kidding

08:22.260 --> 08:25.780
I don't know if it's a problem or not. Like it doesn't bother me

08:25.780 --> 08:27.260
because

08:27.260 --> 08:31.740
They know we've been doing this for like 11 years, right? We've answered basically everything

08:31.740 --> 08:37.700
It's thought starters and also nobody has new problems. They just have same problem want to leave

08:38.220 --> 08:39.500
tired of

08:39.500 --> 08:45.420
This time what you leave the person they want to ask out has blue hair instead of like red hair or whatever

08:45.420 --> 08:47.420
But it's all the same

08:47.780 --> 08:49.740
Reductive. No, you're being reductive

08:49.740 --> 08:55.140
What I'm saying is everybody has same problem and it is brothers want to leave right?

08:55.140 --> 08:59.300
I want to do other else or how make friends

08:59.820 --> 09:01.820
No, you Travis. You're not

09:04.460 --> 09:09.900
The same wavelength as us fuck I guess I just am kind of an introvert and I've liked being inside. Oh

09:10.900 --> 09:13.220
you've been driven mad without the

09:13.940 --> 09:17.260
Travis without the the incredible power of people

09:18.260 --> 09:20.420
applauding for him Travis is withered into a

09:20.420 --> 09:26.740
Huh? Huh? Huh? He's like fucking Gary Oldman in Dracula when he has it fed. He's just lurking around

09:27.140 --> 09:31.300
He's like one of the little snot creatures in Ursula's lair in the little

09:32.500 --> 09:39.340
Yeah, I be actually calls me a Tinkerbell for that very reason. Yeah without people applauding for me. I am dying

09:39.460 --> 09:41.460
Yeah. All right. Well

09:41.820 --> 09:44.740
Let's do it. Oh, thank you. Oh, yeah. Hooray for you

09:44.740 --> 09:50.820
So we're gonna do actual questions because this is how this is this is real, you know

09:51.220 --> 09:57.060
That's like 75 cents. By the way, what is you just said the THI word?

09:58.400 --> 10:02.620
My partner and I are expecting our first baby in September congratulations

10:02.960 --> 10:07.900
After our first midwife appointment, my wife asked me if I wanted to catch the baby at delivery

10:07.900 --> 10:15.220
Don't believe brothers. What is the best technique to catch my child and not experience a big? Oh, oopsie on day one? This is from

10:15.420 --> 10:17.700
Butterfingers Buckeye and Akron and pal

10:18.700 --> 10:20.700
You don't know listen

10:21.020 --> 10:27.040
Don't do it. Listen. I want to do it intra question an intro episode this year. We're here

10:27.040 --> 10:29.040
we're gonna have a lot of fun and

10:29.580 --> 10:31.940
We're gonna have a lot of fun. You should probably just do it

10:31.940 --> 10:36.580
however, the very nice midwife says you should do it right when when dot was

10:36.580 --> 10:40.500
Born we did a scheduled c-section and all

10:41.420 --> 10:46.700
Morning as we were prepared for this at least three different medical professionals asked me

10:47.380 --> 10:54.300
When we remove the baby, yeah, do you want to watch and I said?

10:54.740 --> 10:56.740
At least three different times

10:57.260 --> 10:58.500
No

10:58.500 --> 11:00.380
Not on your life

11:00.380 --> 11:07.660
Yeah, then a fourth medical professional who failed to ask you that question got involved in the delivery

11:07.660 --> 11:15.660
Oh beans and when the baby was removed held it up to me like Rafiki did Simba and I was like put that thing away

11:18.060 --> 11:26.460
Down wipe it down. What are you doing? And here's the thing that you're not expecting Butterfingers Buckeye and Akron when a baby comes out

11:26.460 --> 11:34.260
They're gonna be a little blue and they look fucked up babies when they come out of shit fucked up man

11:34.260 --> 11:38.940
And oh, I'm looking at it going. Oh, no, and now I say not yet

11:38.940 --> 11:40.540
I would say my daughter dot but in that moment

11:40.540 --> 11:46.260
Oh, no, and the doctor and all the everybody else just kept saying like oh good color looks good

11:46.260 --> 11:48.620
No looks good. I don't like I think it's that's a good color

11:49.180 --> 11:54.300
Here's my point question asker. You're gonna have a lot on your mind. You don't want to be in there

11:54.300 --> 11:57.620
You're gonna have a lot on your mind. You don't want to be in there

11:57.620 --> 12:00.460
I mean you got to be in there and you got to be supportive but

12:00.980 --> 12:06.420
like I can't imagine like like imagine you're a major league baseball catcher and

12:06.980 --> 12:11.960
Also behind the pitcher. It's like some kind of monster. Yeah

12:12.500 --> 12:15.780
There's a lot of stuff in that room that if you look at it

12:16.340 --> 12:21.940
It's gonna fuck you up pretty bad. And so you need to be you got to keep your head on a swivel in there

12:21.940 --> 12:29.400
I do not think catching. Well, okay, they're gonna have to catch this baby. So what's the best technique maybe some kind of kid?

12:29.400 --> 12:35.140
Okay, you're gonna get seven other large people and a hula hoop with like some fabric stretched

12:35.140 --> 12:40.860
Oh, I love that cuz that can like catch people jumping out of windows if the building is on fire, right?

12:40.860 --> 12:45.200
So it surely can catch anybody ever actually seen that happen where they stretch out the big

12:45.300 --> 12:49.540
The big trampoline and then people jump out of the buildings and they catch them in the trampoline

12:49.540 --> 12:55.420
That's gotta happen, right? Don't say surely. Have you seen it happen? Have you seen it? I've seen it in cartoons

12:56.220 --> 13:01.180
Travis yeah, I'm talking about this. I see. I see mr. Game and watch do it, but that's a

13:01.700 --> 13:06.380
Any true to life, you know, if there's one thing that I remember from middle school what you're gonna want to do

13:07.340 --> 13:11.740
Get a little parachute attached to the baby ahead of time get some cushioning around it

13:11.740 --> 13:19.460
Yeah, right and so that way even if it falls from like a second story that cushioning that maybe you can like suspend it in the

13:19.460 --> 13:22.160
Middle of a structure with like some rubber bands. Here we go

13:22.160 --> 13:28.220
Now Travis is building fucking a science fair project where you see how high up you can drop the egg from yes, exactly

13:28.220 --> 13:34.620
But with a baby you see so yeah, if we're not is that not what that test was supposed to be for?

13:35.580 --> 13:37.700
Prototype for this exact moment. Yeah

13:38.580 --> 13:42.860
Hey, can I do a yahoo? I'd love that. This one was like that whole time

13:42.860 --> 13:46.620
Justin didn't say anything about how he would catch a baby. Yeah, I'm not going to

13:46.620 --> 13:51.260
But think about how much great free time I'll have when y'all are in the court battle of your fucking lives

13:51.340 --> 13:57.980
Okay, but don't listen to us. You don't have to do any of that. Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's enough. That's enough to do it

13:58.580 --> 14:04.540
This one's sent in by Graham Roebuck. Thank you Graham. It's yahoo answers user good Vegeta who asks

14:05.940 --> 14:08.840
Should the NFL create a SuperDuper Bowl?

14:09.460 --> 14:14.720
If if the team who lost the Super Bowl had better regular season record than team who defeated them

14:14.720 --> 14:17.660
They can ask for a SuperDuper Bowl rematch

14:17.980 --> 14:25.300
It's played in a special gigantic arena with lots more fans if the team with better regular season record doesn't want a challenge to rematch

14:25.300 --> 14:27.780
For SuperDuper Bowl out of belief. They would lose again

14:28.500 --> 14:34.520
Then the next season they could use that challenge left over to claim a first seed playoff spot with first round by

14:34.980 --> 14:42.120
Interesting now, okay. I like the concept, but I don't think that they're executing it the way I would choose

14:42.120 --> 14:47.580
I think a Super Bowl right you have the number one and number two teams, right and whoever wins

14:48.180 --> 14:56.180
Should then in the SuperDuper Bowl one team play against whoever they lost or like whoever lost and the third team

14:56.620 --> 15:02.860
Right now it's one team against two teams. Oh, that's great, right? So it's like, okay. Well you could beat that one team

15:02.900 --> 15:07.100
Let's see how far we can go with this and then no if they win

15:07.100 --> 15:13.460
We go to the SuperDuper Extra Mega Bowl right and that's one team versus three teams and you can see where I'm going right now

15:13.460 --> 15:15.900
Okay, let me hit you with a twist it

15:16.620 --> 15:24.640
Super Bowl who wins whoever won the last one right Tampa Bay. That's not right. Yeah, sure. Okay Bucks win, but then

15:25.380 --> 15:28.780
The Bucks have to compete against the winner of the World Series

15:29.100 --> 15:30.780
Okay from that year

15:30.780 --> 15:38.980
This is the SuperDuper Bowl where the winner the greatest of all the each of the sports gets to compete against the top

15:39.460 --> 15:42.740
Sportos, yeah for like athlete like athlete

15:43.580 --> 15:47.260
Compete in football or in baseball trivia, baby. Oh

15:48.300 --> 15:53.220
I'm meeting of them. I know I'm in flat-footed. Do you see I like oh boy

15:53.220 --> 15:56.420
I like if we did it wwm by we I mean

15:56.420 --> 16:00.280
the National Football League of which I am NOT a

16:00.980 --> 16:02.180
representative

16:02.180 --> 16:06.300
but I would I think the NFL should follow the WWE and

16:06.940 --> 16:12.420
How they do it where they do the the money in the bank and whoever grabs the briefcase

16:12.680 --> 16:18.980
They can exchange that to fight the champ right then and there whenever the fuck they bring the briefcase in

16:18.980 --> 16:20.980
So I don't know what this is the all-star game

16:20.980 --> 16:26.500
Whoever wins the all-star game can like immediately after the Super Bowl the confetti is flying

16:26.500 --> 16:30.560
They're lifting Tom Brady up my shoulders and he's you know

16:31.340 --> 16:33.660
He's he's thinking about fucking a mattress

16:33.660 --> 16:40.180
He's doing his whole thing that he fucking does and then but you hear not so fast

16:40.180 --> 16:47.420
and it's the all-star team and they get to they get to do it now and that's a great strategy because the

16:47.420 --> 16:49.420
Buccaneers are so tired

16:49.420 --> 16:54.740
I'm gonna take it and turn it just a little bit Griffin. Okay, so the Buccaneers have just won, right?

16:54.740 --> 16:57.740
I'm Brady. I want everyone shoulders think about fucking a mattress, right?

16:58.340 --> 17:02.660
Then not so fast. Who's that? It's the dark Buccaneers. Oh

17:04.100 --> 17:10.380
It's like they're exact replicas right they have to beat their clones. I love this. Yeah, I always love this, right?

17:10.380 --> 17:14.700
It's the best part of like any video game where you have to fight yourself and like you move to the right and they move

17:14.700 --> 17:17.380
To the left. That's what I'm talking. That's good. Yeah, that's good

17:17.380 --> 17:23.940
Or we could just go Final Fantasy 7 style where after the after they lift up Tom Brady up on his shoulders

17:23.940 --> 17:29.900
He's thinking about having a good sex with a mattress and they're celebrating but then he looks back on the field and he says set

17:29.900 --> 17:35.060
Me down and he slowly walks back out on the field where the Kansas City Chiefs

17:35.780 --> 17:37.780
quarterback Patrick Mahomes

17:37.860 --> 17:44.500
This is there and he's shirtless and we do it Sephiroth style where if you really want to win the Super Bowl

17:44.500 --> 17:51.180
You really want to win the Super Bowl? We settled this one-on-one quarterback versus quarterback

17:51.180 --> 17:55.620
Yeah, you beyond QB street ball just like we used to play where one quarterback

17:56.740 --> 17:58.940
Everybody's got giant heads throws it to

17:59.420 --> 18:03.140
To just throws it down the street and then you run and just try to grab okay

18:03.140 --> 18:05.140
They have to pick someone from the crowd

18:05.740 --> 18:12.300
Okay, so that way, you know, it's like this is all about quarterback skill. Yeah, right. We're just gonna pick because okay

18:12.300 --> 18:16.820
Oh, here's the thing. Sometimes when the Super Bowl is done, right? The quarterbacks get a lot of credit

18:16.820 --> 18:22.940
I feel so empty after the Super Bowl is done, right? No, I was here before the next Super Bowl. Fuck

18:22.940 --> 18:26.660
Yeah, I was bad for like the other members of the team, right?

18:26.660 --> 18:31.080
Cuz the quarterback gets so much credit. So when the Super Bowl is done, we switch quarterbacks

18:31.080 --> 18:37.100
We play again exact same game. We swapped quarterbacks. Now. We see how this game goes, right?

18:37.100 --> 18:39.880
I'm still gonna probably reflexively pass to their guys

18:39.880 --> 18:41.840
well

18:41.840 --> 18:44.360
Okay, we okay now

18:45.280 --> 18:53.080
The quarterbacks are gonna rotate to safety and everybody else is gonna move up one spot. We play again. Okay, right?

18:53.840 --> 18:55.960
That's maybe it's punter

18:55.960 --> 18:58.680
I don't want to downplay cuz I couldn't do any of them

18:58.680 --> 19:02.400
But there has to be a like and you're at this end

19:02.400 --> 19:07.840
There's somebody on that team who's there's got to be somebody on every team in the major sports

19:07.840 --> 19:13.480
Who sucks shit, but they just hoping like man. I hope I don't go in. Yeah

19:14.080 --> 19:18.960
That's good. That was me in every sport. I ever played up to this point. I'm just happy to be here

19:19.560 --> 19:21.560
We solved it. Yep

19:21.640 --> 19:28.080
That was an easy one. Yeah, I wish they were all but all slid down that smoothly because it normally there's a little bit more

19:28.080 --> 19:33.480
Of a challenge. Um, can I so real quick? This isn't really a question, but I you know, I I go through the

19:33.480 --> 19:37.000
the the emails and from time to time

19:37.000 --> 19:42.920
I think it's important to do just a little PSA here folks about getting your question on the show. Yeah, and

19:43.560 --> 19:50.960
This this question stuck out to me. Okay, I will read the body of the email and then I will read the subject line

19:52.200 --> 19:55.120
The body of the email reads title says it all

19:55.120 --> 20:03.080
Thanks brothers wet and wild in Alberta. Okay, and then the subject line is how do I stay dry at the dentist?

20:04.200 --> 20:09.400
Yeah, that's a good that's it because you've now it's a mystery a puzzle box

20:10.160 --> 20:16.560
For us to try and crack open. I would argue here question asker. The title does not quite say it all

20:16.640 --> 20:18.640
No, there's definitely a lot

20:18.640 --> 20:23.600
There's a lot left unsaid here. Yeah, maybe a little too much room for us to play

20:23.600 --> 20:25.660
I would say a little bit

20:26.400 --> 20:33.600
Too loosey-goosey here with how one might be getting a little wet and wild at the dentist. Yeah, that's not great

20:33.600 --> 20:35.600
That's not a place where?

20:35.960 --> 20:37.960
Moisture of any kind is acceptable

20:38.240 --> 20:43.480
No, cuz you they you put it it goes up the tube that it sucks it out fast

20:43.680 --> 20:47.640
Do you guys wish you have one of those just going in your mouth all day? Yes

20:47.640 --> 20:54.440
Yes, I'll never forget. I was a child at the dentist and one of the the dental hygienist

20:54.840 --> 21:00.000
Cleaning my teeth said aloud you are the spittiest kid I've ever worked on

21:01.120 --> 21:06.720
And that is a thing that's really stuck with me over the years. Yeah one spitty kid

21:06.800 --> 21:14.200
Yeah, and I think a comment like that offhandedly delivered by a professional. It's the kind of thing that shapes a young man

21:14.200 --> 21:17.600
That's somebody who would know yeah

21:18.120 --> 21:25.800
Like a stranger. Yeah, there's somebody who would know it's really stuck with me my housemate, and I have recently been getting more into puzzles

21:29.440 --> 21:36.000
One time I was at a weekend murder mystery Ravenwood Castle and now extinct shadow stalkers

21:37.880 --> 21:39.880
Murder mystery

21:39.920 --> 21:41.920
crew and

21:41.920 --> 21:46.200
They do murder mysteries, and there was one guy there who of his own

21:47.000 --> 21:48.400
volition

21:48.400 --> 21:53.520
He decided he would style himself as a puzzle master. Uh-huh and he would

21:54.440 --> 22:01.760
Not through the organizers know of the event. He was sort of like a rogue puzzle master

22:02.280 --> 22:06.320
God, I miss these fucking things. It was like it was my my Bonnaroo

22:06.320 --> 22:13.120
So they made himself a rogue puzzle master, and he would just stand up and announce. I have more puzzles

22:13.120 --> 22:18.440
And they were good. They were good. Were you there for that guy? Yeah? He was there the

22:19.040 --> 22:20.800
One I loved it

22:20.800 --> 22:26.320
Fucking the greatest it's the greatest thing on the world turn out dude worked at the meat counter at Kroger

22:26.960 --> 22:30.520
Fantastic, and he and he gets his one week. It'd be a puzzle master grace

22:30.520 --> 22:34.920
Can he hook it he sees that opportunity yes loved it?

22:34.920 --> 22:35.920
it

22:35.920 --> 22:42.360
Puzzles how he would say every time and it made me excited about puzzle sure I that was my favorite thing about going to those

22:42.360 --> 22:47.980
Things Justin because the people seizing the opportunities like that person who with no affiliation to the organizers

22:48.160 --> 22:52.040
Dresses the werewolf and scared people in the woods. So it's just a werewolf and ran around the woods

22:52.040 --> 22:54.720
Yeah, he just wanted to do that scare the shit out of me one time

22:54.720 --> 22:58.920
I was at the murder mystery shadow stalkers, and someone stood up dressed as

22:58.920 --> 23:05.560
um Johnny Depp pirate Jack Captain Jack Sparrow yeah, and um his name was Dave

23:05.560 --> 23:10.680
I think and he stood up and I noticed that he'd been there a few murder mysteries in that exact same costume

23:10.680 --> 23:13.880
And then he stood up at the last day of the murder mystery

23:13.880 --> 23:18.640
Everybody has to stand up without their costumes on and say who they really are and he stood up

23:18.640 --> 23:26.080
And he was still dressed as Johnny Depp pirate. He said I have come to realize that Dave is the costume

23:26.080 --> 23:28.400
Huh fuck. Yeah, yes

23:29.480 --> 23:34.720
Yeah, go live your life reclaim Captain Jack Sparrow you are Batman

23:35.720 --> 23:41.400
We are it's a reclamation project. We're taking him back. You can't have him Johnny

23:41.880 --> 23:47.000
We're taking back Captain Jack Sparrow time. We see weirdly photorealistic

23:47.400 --> 23:50.720
Johnny Depp at the end of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride out Walt Disney

23:50.720 --> 23:56.940
I do there is a part of me that recoils slightly like anymore. You're taking it back. Now. He's Dave

23:57.080 --> 24:02.420
There was a point in history where people like I hear Johnny Depp sometimes sneaks on to and appears on it

24:02.420 --> 24:05.480
And it was said in a much different way than it would be said now

24:13.160 --> 24:15.360
Johnny Depp sneaks on to the Pirates of the Caribbean

24:15.360 --> 24:21.440
Okay, so we put together a really rad thousand piecer of a bunch of colorful scoops of ice cream

24:21.440 --> 24:24.080
I took a lot of effort over the week or so now

24:24.080 --> 24:27.120
It's just chilling out taking a good half of our coffee table

24:27.200 --> 24:31.560
How long do we keep it assembled before we undo all our hard work and throw it back in the box?

24:31.760 --> 24:38.080
What's the proper amount of time to bask in our accomplishments versus maybe wanting the surface area back? That's from Pittsburgh puzzlers

24:38.080 --> 24:45.520
Okay, this is I totally understand this question because you have kind of like if if you don't do it right away

24:45.520 --> 24:53.480
Which is so disheartening which can really destroy your coverage. Then it's like how long is enough to take?

24:53.480 --> 24:55.160
Are you I?

24:55.160 --> 24:57.160
have this feeling

24:57.200 --> 24:59.560
Are either of you the type of person that would like?

25:00.320 --> 25:04.480
She'll lack a puzzle. You have a little puzzle glue buy some puzzle glue

25:04.480 --> 25:09.000
No amount and like frame it cuz you're never in a million because the glue eventually

25:09.720 --> 25:13.840
Will also wear off and the puzzle will it will erode?

25:13.840 --> 25:20.480
I I would instantly take apart the putt you've wasted your time right making a puzzle is a waste of time

25:20.880 --> 25:26.360
But you've wasted the time in the way you choose and there's fucking power in that right?

25:26.360 --> 25:29.120
Yeah, I've decided I'm gonna waste my time exactly like this

25:29.120 --> 25:32.640
I'm gonna make a picture of ice cream. No one likes and then when you're done with it

25:32.640 --> 25:37.600
you know what you do you spit the face of mortality and say and now I'm going to take it apart because I can because

25:37.600 --> 25:41.480
I'm alive and I'm a human being and I'm gonna disassemble it there right back in the fucking box

25:41.480 --> 25:47.760
Just go ahead and burn my time. I want you should be allowed to fucking destroy. There should be instructions on the box

25:47.760 --> 25:54.640
I put it together and once it's done look at it for one uninterrupted minute and then put it down the fucking garbage

25:55.200 --> 25:58.400
Disposal, baby. Yeah, throw it up in the air

25:58.400 --> 26:02.800
Can you imagine the satisfaction of throwing the air and then just punching right through the whole shit? Oh my god

26:03.280 --> 26:07.440
You've earned it better yet charge somebody to come do that

26:08.120 --> 26:11.160
Cuz oh, that's true and then say like hey

26:11.160 --> 26:16.520
Do you want like have the feeling of honest-to-god like destroying five hours of my life?

26:17.080 --> 26:19.600
Here you go, but $25, right?

26:20.520 --> 26:24.280
$25 and then you can use that on your next puzzle. This is what I'm saying

26:24.280 --> 26:29.720
Okay, now it's a gig economy and that's how we keep things going. You know what? I mean your jobs creator now

26:29.720 --> 26:31.720
I am here from puzzler

26:31.720 --> 26:33.720
There's no you or II

26:34.160 --> 26:39.640
It's just puzzler. Yeah, and I'm here to destroy your puzzle. I want to destroy something beautiful. Ah, yes, right this way

26:41.520 --> 26:43.520
We made it

26:44.200 --> 26:49.960
Used to look like this it used to be many smaller pieces of ice cream picture. Do you want me to?

26:49.960 --> 26:55.840
Do the lights any certain way or no, thank you. I would like you to would you mind leaving the room you leave the room?

26:55.840 --> 27:00.800
Oh, you don't want me to watch? No, no, no. No, I'm not one of those. No, no, no, that's not really my thing

27:01.160 --> 27:07.760
No shade, but like I really I I just want to take it apart piece by piece one by one

27:07.760 --> 27:09.720
Oh, sorry, just before you leave

27:09.720 --> 27:14.520
Are you ever gonna want to put this together or is it okay if I just eat a few or does that bother you?

27:15.200 --> 27:17.520
Six or seven. I'm never gonna put it together. Yeah, okay

27:17.520 --> 27:19.520
I imagine recently the same puzzle. Oh

27:20.400 --> 27:24.720
I can't remember what it looks like. Are you kidding me? It's right here on the box Bob Bob stop

27:25.240 --> 27:31.200
What are you doing? I can't do this with kids our age like the kids there

27:31.200 --> 27:35.800
If it's not a one-shot if it's not something I finish in one night, there's no point

27:35.800 --> 27:40.680
I can leave it in the highest cabin. Yeah, it's all a shelf and they would sense it and destroy it

27:40.680 --> 27:41.960
Yeah, here's the thing that I learned

27:41.960 --> 27:44.080
I used to do puzzles a lot and then I realized

27:44.080 --> 27:49.560
I could just like print pictures off the internet if I wanted to look at ice cream. Yeah, and it was done way faster

27:50.280 --> 27:56.400
Yeah, or you think now I knit which is like putting together a puzzle that can keep you warm

27:56.680 --> 28:01.960
You can't do that with like a jigsaw puzzle you could try but people will laugh at you

28:01.960 --> 28:07.120
Do they have jigsaw puzzles that turn that are useful at the end? Wouldn't that be cool? Yeah

28:07.120 --> 28:09.120
I guess it's kind of Ikea

28:09.120 --> 28:11.120
Yeah

28:12.640 --> 28:14.480
We're gonna take a quick break and

28:14.480 --> 28:18.440
We're gonna head into the money zone and then we'll tell you about some of our beautiful sponsors

28:18.440 --> 28:20.440

28:47.580 --> 28:54.060
Now let's talk about Bombas, okay, this is dedicated to making the most comfortable socks in the history of feet

28:54.180 --> 28:56.620
They've rethought every detail. I'm wearing a pair right now

28:56.620 --> 29:03.380
I love the kind of hexagonal support in the middle the no seam on the toe, but that's not it

29:03.580 --> 29:07.140
I'll tell you my favorite thing about it. They do more than keep your feet cozy

29:07.140 --> 29:11.740
They help give back to the most vulnerable members of our community for every pair of socks you purchase

29:11.740 --> 29:19.580

It's podcast and then a podcast profile the latest grits and brand eating and it's not going anywhere. No, baby. He's here to stay

33:18.440 --> 33:25.480
Pringles this is I'm gonna I want to start covering NFTs in more detail. This is not about NFTs

33:26.280 --> 33:27.800
NFTs are

33:27.800 --> 33:33.800
They're like unique unique tokens that you could trade online like poach among cards, but they're bad for the planet

33:33.800 --> 33:40.960
They because I use a lot of resources. I'm and Pringles launching NFT along with Taco Bell. Are they real I?

33:41.520 --> 33:44.080
I've kept myself. I'm actually not gonna do that

33:44.080 --> 33:47.200
Okay, I'm not I'm actually not gonna listen to like planet money or something

33:47.200 --> 33:53.280
But the first response to Pringles launching their NFT is from someone just said the planet is dying Pringles

33:53.280 --> 33:58.280
Oh

33:59.200 --> 34:01.280
So this news in

34:01.880 --> 34:07.020
Pringles has plucked a new flavor from the far reaches of the gaming world

34:07.520 --> 34:10.640
answering a question pondered by many Halo fans

34:11.360 --> 34:17.840
What what a moa burger tastes like? I don't know that is okay. So Griff you I've played Halo

34:17.840 --> 34:23.200
You've played all the halos you co-founded a video gaming website covered video games for 10 15 years

34:23.200 --> 34:27.280
However long it's been you don't know you don't know what a moa is

34:27.280 --> 34:32.480
This is the wildest pull I've ever seen for a video game crossover product

34:32.480 --> 34:38.320
This is Pringles wavy moa burger now a moa is the big

34:39.080 --> 34:42.880
flightless bird like creatures with two legs wings

34:43.600 --> 34:46.280
scales from the neck up and a lizard like head

34:46.280 --> 34:51.120
Similar to the extinct bird from New Zealand of the same name

34:51.200 --> 34:58.120
So just to double-check what the lead on this story would have us believe is that one?

34:58.320 --> 34:59.840
Anybody remembers the name of that?

34:59.840 --> 35:07.640
But two whilst playing the game and seeing said a large road with scales and whatnot their thought was wonder what that tastes like

35:08.480 --> 35:12.240
For those not fluent in the video game halos lore moa

35:12.240 --> 35:16.960
or like I said the bird is native to the halo planet called reach and

35:17.160 --> 35:21.320
Is the signature dish of a restaurant chain in that unit fuck?

35:21.760 --> 35:29.080
Just give me a Master Chief burger. I'm an idiot. Give me a Master Chief burger with Cortana sauce. I'm a fucking idiot

35:30.200 --> 35:34.960
The bird is native to the halo planet reach and the signature dish of a restaurant chain in that universe

35:34.960 --> 35:43.720
So the gaming community is continually curious about what moa might taste like in burger form. Really? This is like the longest

35:44.960 --> 35:52.040
Fucking walk ever and what's wild column halo chips is there was supposed to be a new halo game

35:52.040 --> 35:57.560
And now there's not and the only thing that makes sense is that Pringles had already made all the chips

35:57.560 --> 36:02.760
Yeah, they're like listen. We can't wait for them to finish the new halo game. They should

36:02.760 --> 36:04.640
Do it fail

36:04.640 --> 36:09.520
We have to make the even more insane play. I'm just releasing these chips

36:10.480 --> 36:13.120
Nothing for no reason

36:14.560 --> 36:17.140
Through Pringles exclusive partnership with halo

36:18.160 --> 36:25.080
The new moa burger flavor brings the food item from the halo universe to life with an interstellar twist on the much enjoyed

36:25.400 --> 36:28.520
Sometimes written and often misunderstood moa bird

36:28.520 --> 36:34.720
This bird is based on a real bird that went extinct in New Zealand and now you can eat it

36:34.720 --> 36:37.940
All right. This is so good in a pretty nice Pringles

36:37.940 --> 36:44.720
I always there is not a paragraph in here explaining why it doesn't just taste like burger. I'm gonna lose it

36:44.720 --> 36:48.760
I'll hit you with that. Listen, they did a baconator. They know what they're doing. They're experts

36:48.760 --> 36:50.480
No, but this is what I'm saying. It's like

36:50.480 --> 36:53.840
Okay, go on. Go on. Thank you. I'm just mad Justin

36:53.840 --> 36:58.760
I'm just a little verse has one of the greatest fan bases within the gaming world. Okay

36:58.760 --> 37:04.440
So we had to create a flavor that would deliver on a taste fans could previously only imagine

37:04.960 --> 37:10.400
The famous moa burger, but isn't that what any taste in halo it right?

37:10.400 --> 37:17.160
Like hey, I don't know what anything in halo tastes like Gareth McGuire senior director of marketing for Pringles. This is nothing

37:17.160 --> 37:19.160
Yeah, but none of it's anything

37:19.160 --> 37:24.280
Even us gamers on this podcast don't know what you're fucking talking about

37:24.280 --> 37:28.600
Yeah, I've learned more about what it would be like to lick master chiefs helmet

37:28.600 --> 37:34.680
Yeah, they're gonna eat that or the inside of it. Check this out. Let me flip this into a successful business plan

37:34.720 --> 37:35.720
Let me flip it

37:35.720 --> 37:37.040
We have taken

37:37.040 --> 37:43.760
We have extracted the DNA of the extinct moa bird and put it into a chip so that you can eat it to know what this

37:43.760 --> 37:45.680
long dead animal tastes like

37:45.680 --> 37:50.760
That's awesome because that opens the door to Pringles immortality

37:50.800 --> 37:53.960
Like when I when I die, don't roll me up and smoke me

37:54.560 --> 37:56.960
Turn me into a potato slurry mash

37:58.120 --> 38:04.800
Slice that baby up into delicious crisps extrude them and shot me down. Oh, I miss Griffin

38:04.800 --> 38:06.800
He died 500 years ago, but

38:08.360 --> 38:12.520
Mmm taste him on the Pringle. That's the technology

38:12.520 --> 38:19.080
In case you're curious they deliver a bowl crunch because they're wavy feature a blend of flavors including garlic

38:19.520 --> 38:21.520
sweet ginger and

38:21.560 --> 38:22.800
savory beef

38:22.800 --> 38:30.920
Okay, each bite finishes with a craveable slight heat from chili pepper and red pepper that will take taste buds on a journey to new

38:30.920 --> 38:32.920
star system

38:35.520 --> 38:39.920
Gareth said we pride ourselves in creating an insanely accurate flavor combination

38:39.920 --> 38:45.880
This is a fun one to develop while moa burger has a flavor that appeals to everyone

38:45.880 --> 38:51.600
We expect this to be enjoyed and maybe even collected by Halo fans. Oh boy

38:52.320 --> 38:53.600
Got a

38:53.600 --> 39:00.560
Sometime this segment guys. Sometimes this one goes down. They're only at Walmart Pringles tweeted about them on March 3rd and

39:02.240 --> 39:06.600
I got some replies for you guys to the tweet. I got some replies

39:06.600 --> 39:11.520
I'm just gonna read some of the replies to the tweet about the chips the new chips that are only at Walmart and based on

39:11.520 --> 39:15.800
The space man bird. I'm having some but after eating too many it gets really hot

39:16.400 --> 39:22.920
What help please help me help me Master Chief them holding the chip as if maybe you were doubting it

39:23.400 --> 39:28.560
See, I feel like there's two types of people in this world people who play Halo and people who shop at Walmart

39:28.560 --> 39:30.560
And there's not much overlap between the two

39:30.560 --> 39:35.400
I would argue quite a few. Halo players shop at Walmart

39:35.400 --> 39:41.680
It's not even a judgment call just stay with a fact a lot of people shop at Walmart and a lot of people play Halo

39:41.680 --> 39:48.200
The chance that there's not much of an overlap is a small right are these in Canada too?

39:49.240 --> 39:54.680
Unfortunately says Pringles. Yes limited time product is only available in the US

39:55.520 --> 39:58.240
Come on. I want to I wanted to try them out

39:58.240 --> 40:05.160
It tastes so awesome. Please. Let us keep them then Walmart says thanks Vic. Glad you like it

40:05.880 --> 40:07.880
Anyway, I'm Walmart

40:08.960 --> 40:15.200
I'm 350 billion market cap Walmart just responding to your tweet about the space chip with it with an

40:16.240 --> 40:21.960
Unenthusiastic and non-committal answer I might add. Thanks. No, but I said can I keep them? Okay. Thanks, dude

40:22.400 --> 40:24.400
Please please I need this

40:24.400 --> 40:32.300
Oh, thank you Pringles. You saved my life. Please don't ever get rid of them. Wow. This is pickle eye Joe says

40:33.080 --> 40:40.460
Delicious, then Pringle says there's a high probability your taste buds will enjoy reaching capital are

40:41.080 --> 40:48.720
Reaching new heights with moa burgers Pringles. See you at Walmart pickle eye Joe rioters burned down my Walmart. Whoa

40:48.720 --> 40:50.720
Oh

40:56.400 --> 41:02.240
Just a quick note Steve next time don't engage with pickle eye Joe we we learned that a long time ago

41:02.240 --> 41:10.600
Yeah, our first time with pickle eye Joe, but I will thumbs up and then Pringle says you're about to witness the newest Pringles flavor

41:10.800 --> 41:17.000
Plucked from the far reaches of the Halo verse run don't walk to your nearest Walmart or will kill you

41:17.000 --> 41:21.340
Kid skull says already got some very yum and Pringles response

41:21.900 --> 41:28.520
Congratulations, you are among the very few so far who have taken their taste buds to new galaxies by trying Pringles Moa burger

41:28.680 --> 41:32.300
Then kids call says I glad you guys are still kicking around in 25

41:33.440 --> 41:35.000
Awesome

41:35.000 --> 41:40.040
It's just rice says are they at every store. I'm pretty sure we've established it just at Walmart

41:40.280 --> 41:42.560
Jake says can I order them online? Nope

41:42.560 --> 41:44.560
Cago

41:45.640 --> 41:49.640
Available in Poland, I don't know. Do you got Walmart's there? Are you America?

41:49.640 --> 41:53.880
I've been surprised by the answer with others. So I'll just ask are these vegan?

41:54.520 --> 41:56.520
This they're not big. Oh, they're not

41:57.200 --> 42:02.640
They got moa. They got moa flakes in them. They're wicked not vegan super not vegan. They got moa

42:03.200 --> 42:08.920
Has anyone has anyone tweeted? I want moa them. Oh, that's good trap. Thank you

42:08.920 --> 42:13.960
I'm a professional comedy person. Yeah. Um, hey, can I do that Yahoo now?

42:14.560 --> 42:16.680
Are there more incredible tweets about this?

42:19.560 --> 42:24.520
Because I'm excited about this one several people have said it and thanks everybody's Yahoo answers user Jake who asks

42:25.120 --> 42:28.440
in the category entertainment and music music rap and hip-hop

42:29.380 --> 42:33.520
Should we get rid of the calendars and dates and just go with the flow?

42:35.680 --> 42:37.340
So

42:37.340 --> 42:39.560
Rad that yeah kicks

42:40.800 --> 42:48.280
Man, it's tough for me to even feign enthusiasm because I feel like how we wouldn't be recording right now. Oh my god Griffin

42:48.280 --> 42:49.720
You're so uptight

42:49.720 --> 42:55.720
Wait, you're afraid of missing doctor's appointments. Just go to the doctor when your body needs it. You know what I mean? Okay

42:55.720 --> 42:58.280
This is oh, what's that? You're late for brunch

42:58.560 --> 43:04.680
No, you'll get to brunch when it's time for you to have brunch and maybe your friend will be there and maybe they won't

43:04.680 --> 43:11.120
You know what? I mean? Maybe I was late to my job interview Derek because I wasn't ready to be interviewed

43:11.120 --> 43:16.460
Yeah, you know what? I mean dad. Yeah. Hey, I don't feel like going to college today dad

43:16.880 --> 43:22.020
You're just a rock in the middle of the flow while I am a leaf. I'm a leaf

43:22.240 --> 43:26.000
I'm traveling down the way the river. Can I borrow 20 bucks?

43:26.000 --> 43:35.000
Give me $20. I just need it for Pringles. Give me $20 now because I don't really do time

43:35.960 --> 43:41.200
So that's not the linear sense that you're sort of into so I need that right now

43:41.200 --> 43:47.960
I'm just saying what does it matter if you think it's Monday, and I think it's Wednesday if you give me $20

43:47.960 --> 43:54.240
Yeah, I mean like what's it? What's it really matter if I cleaned my room when I'm really stoned

43:54.240 --> 44:01.160
We're gonna have to restructure society. I feel like to pull this off. No jobs. No school. Okay, no doctor's appointments

44:01.160 --> 44:06.780
What's other things use no birthdays? No trains, right? So like no birthdays no holidays

44:07.320 --> 44:09.320
It's just there is

44:10.000 --> 44:11.480
now

44:11.480 --> 44:16.360
There is now. Okay. Now you're talking to me. Yeah. Yeah, this is so good

44:16.360 --> 44:22.940
And that would be dope. That would be so rad for us because then like we could just like release episodes

44:22.940 --> 44:27.420
when it's when they are needing to be

44:28.380 --> 44:32.780
Released when we have one in us to make it and not

44:33.780 --> 44:34.940
immediately

44:34.940 --> 44:36.140
after

44:36.140 --> 44:39.060
Doing a very very long the adventure zone record

44:41.060 --> 44:47.740
We would just feel it and fucking do it now that would be a fun way to explain to someone why you didn't like pay

44:47.740 --> 44:49.040
your bills

44:49.040 --> 44:55.140
Hey, I noticed you're late on this am I or perhaps the bill did not need to be paid. There would be no bills

44:55.140 --> 44:56.860
Oh, okay, right, right, right

44:56.860 --> 45:01.860
Cuz when because we're all just going with the flow people who make the electricity and bring it to your house

45:01.860 --> 45:09.140
We'll come knock on your door and say it's time and then you'll give them whatever money that you have. Oh, that's great

45:09.140 --> 45:13.640
They'll make the energy to give to me and I have I don't know grown some wheat or something

45:13.640 --> 45:16.580
So I'll give them the energy they brought

45:16.580 --> 45:23.320
I'm like, right and then you say you're gonna want to cook that for one hour and then they'll say

45:23.820 --> 45:29.580
What's an hour because there's no time so cooking things is gonna get pretty fucked up pretty bad

45:29.620 --> 45:35.540
So only raw foods, which is good cuz that's what we should be doing. Anyway, how raw though Griffin

45:35.860 --> 45:39.500
Raw raw raw what? Okay question

45:40.260 --> 45:43.220
Sunday morning is the day that I clean the house. Okay

45:43.220 --> 45:48.780
So how will I know when house dirty house got dirt on start? Do you clean it?

45:50.780 --> 45:53.700
An alarm for when to take a shit. Yeah

45:54.860 --> 45:57.540
No, no, you do and your body tells you to now

45:57.540 --> 45:59.460
You just gotta wait for a house to tell you to clean it

45:59.460 --> 46:03.380
Like your house is your bowels and the cleaning is the shit and everybody's body

46:03.620 --> 46:08.540
does have a point where they look around at their environment and just goes and

46:08.940 --> 46:12.700
That's when that's when yeah, that's when you take a shit

46:12.700 --> 46:17.340
Yeah, well now do you set an alarm for when it's time to wake up? Um

46:18.020 --> 46:22.180
Yeah, I did. No, I actually don't do that cuz my stupid body won't let me sleep

46:22.180 --> 46:26.020
Ah, it's like your body knows better than Oh, mr. Clock over there, huh?

46:26.020 --> 46:30.740
So my body's going with the flow, but I haven't enjoyed that. Oh, I kind of wish it would rated it

46:30.740 --> 46:37.660
Hey, what if we went the opposite way and nobody went with the flow and we just scheduled everything. No fucking flow. Yeah, that's great

46:37.660 --> 46:43.220
I'm just saying like now like you do have a time when you're allowed to take a shit and if you miss it

46:43.380 --> 46:45.380
Too bad, you know what? I mean?

46:45.860 --> 46:50.720
Now it is like an extra super duper preachy episode of Star Trek the next generation

46:51.380 --> 46:55.180
Where it's like they're about to kiss and somebody comes up and it's like no

46:55.940 --> 47:00.160
Kissing time's over. It is not kissing time. And then it's like but love

47:00.900 --> 47:04.780
You can't put a time schedule on you can't make love

47:04.780 --> 47:10.820
Well, if you guys kiss we're gonna kill Wesley. That's right. Wesley did a kiss during hug time

47:10.820 --> 47:16.700
So he's fucking dead now because we killed him. And as soon as murder time rolls around he's out of here

47:16.700 --> 47:19.460
He's done so. You're lucky we only murder on Fridays

47:19.460 --> 47:23.060
Ah shit guys if we get rid of dates and calendars you just go with the flow

47:23.060 --> 47:26.700
How are we supposed to know when the purge is? Oh, man, that's true

47:26.700 --> 47:29.620
You'll just you'll go up and hit someone in the head with a sledgehammer

47:29.620 --> 47:34.620
And then someone's like not yet. Yeah, you go to jail. You're like fuck that wasn't it

47:34.620 --> 47:39.420
I had but then you could just walk out of jail because there's no such thing as jail sentences. Oh, yeah, that's right

47:39.420 --> 47:42.940
How long do I have to be in here? Oh, uh, we haven't thought of that. Yeah, I didn't

47:46.100 --> 47:51.000
So I was at work one day with another co-worker it was really slow so we were talking about sharing stories

47:51.620 --> 47:57.380
Talking and sharing stories. She got a customer right after telling me something super personal

47:57.380 --> 48:03.060
She ended it with don't tell anyone. I told you that you're the only one in this whole state. I've told

48:03.700 --> 48:05.700
Problem is I zone the fuck out

48:05.700 --> 48:12.100
She was talking and I didn't hear anything that she said since then she brought it up again saying that thing

48:12.100 --> 48:16.780
I told you before. What do I do? Oh boy. That's from awful co-worker and

48:17.580 --> 48:24.640
Alaska and I think this is great. Oh, I think this is wonderful. Go on. Okay

48:24.640 --> 48:31.440
Okay, I'm going to tell you the person on the other end of this question

48:32.200 --> 48:35.980
She got to unload the thing that has been bothering her

48:36.600 --> 48:37.800
you

48:37.800 --> 48:40.880
Have now that but that information is very sensitive

48:41.760 --> 48:49.080
You have now become like a cryptocurrency cold wallet at this point. Okay that data is

48:49.920 --> 48:52.280
fucking archived and locked down

48:52.280 --> 48:54.280
beyond all

48:55.120 --> 48:58.000
Blockchain on the blockchain now

48:58.000 --> 49:04.820
You can't get the block chain of your rudeness is what it's all right, and that's great. Yeah

49:06.200 --> 49:13.720
Sometimes people do have to say sometimes people do tell you things because they do they are looking for a source of commiseration

49:14.640 --> 49:20.760
but it is also like a heavy load sometimes and they're gonna be worried that you'll let it slip and

49:20.760 --> 49:28.040
And they all they don't have to because it can't slip it won't slip. Yeah, it's not even technically there

49:28.040 --> 49:30.040
It's not there. That's awesome

49:30.120 --> 49:36.800
Now if you did want to figure it out, is there a way to do that? Other than hey, just so you know, I

49:37.640 --> 49:43.800
Wasn't really listening to her that super sensitive thing that you've only told me damn it. Why didn't you fucking listen?

49:43.800 --> 49:50.240
Fuck you should listen. Hey Griffin. You sound like my brain ten times a day. Yeah

49:50.920 --> 49:52.640
Really? You should have listened to their net

49:52.640 --> 49:55.760
Sometimes my brain does that when I'm meeting somebody and they're like hi

49:55.760 --> 50:02.200
I'm and my brains like pay attention, but the brain is so loud saying that that I don't actually hear the name

50:02.440 --> 50:09.160
Yeah, and you're looking I'm thinking like I'm listening so hard right now. Yeah shit. I'm doing such a good job listening. Oh, no

50:09.920 --> 50:11.640
Yeah

50:11.640 --> 50:12.920
Sure

50:12.920 --> 50:17.160
Okay, I'm gonna give you a script. So I've been thinking about what you told me, you know the thing

50:17.160 --> 50:20.160
Oh, yeah, the thing that I don't want you to tell anybody ever you've been carrying

50:20.160 --> 50:27.680
Yeah, exactly even carrying around the burden that for so long and I read about an exercise in time a leadership magazine that I subscribe

50:27.680 --> 50:29.680
to leadership

50:30.080 --> 50:32.400
Monthly actually, oh, it's I don't think it's good

50:33.000 --> 50:37.160
So I doesn't say is that today with the ever-changing leadership techniques, but go on

50:37.160 --> 50:43.160
What what you do is you write the thing down on a scrap of paper, okay, and then you fold it

50:43.160 --> 50:45.480
And then I'll go burn it for you

50:45.960 --> 50:53.440
When you're not around, okay, and that way you'll be free of the burden. I have really bad handwriting. Is that a problem?

50:53.880 --> 50:55.880
It's like it's like not even legible

50:56.440 --> 51:00.880
Can you put it on Google Drive as I'm worried about a secure thing?

51:00.880 --> 51:05.760
Do you have like any kind of like a typewriter I can use do you how much do you know about the blockchain?

51:05.760 --> 51:07.760
Oh, I know quite a bit

51:07.840 --> 51:09.840
Shit, okay

51:10.560 --> 51:16.040

51:16.880 --> 51:21.640

51:32.300 --> 51:39.140
