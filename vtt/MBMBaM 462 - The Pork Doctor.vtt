00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:48.480
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the

00:48.480 --> 00:53.120
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis

00:53.120 --> 00:58.720
McElroy. And I am your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. I tried to do a normal one.

00:58.720 --> 01:03.600
I tried to think, like, how's a normal person just say the introduction to, like, a normal,

01:03.600 --> 01:08.240
happy person. I thought about, like, I'm unhappy, just like, sure, it doesn't need to be weird just

01:08.240 --> 01:12.720
because I feel weird about doing it. Just like, how do you say your name? Yeah, I thought about,

01:12.720 --> 01:16.560
like, what if I did, like, a howl in the middle of mine? See, it doesn't need to be that every

01:16.560 --> 01:22.480
single fucking time. Yeah, or it doesn't need to be that. We're near 500. We can't keep, we can't

01:22.480 --> 01:28.640
keep escalating. Introducing the program. My name's Justin. I'm a person. I got two brothers.

01:29.280 --> 01:34.320
We do this show. Just because I feel weird about introducing a show doesn't mean I have to make it

01:34.320 --> 01:40.560
weird while I'm doing it. It's hard to get comfortable in my own skin. What with this weird

01:40.560 --> 01:47.440
hair everywhere, this new hair that everybody else is so excited about, but I'm so, so scared

01:47.440 --> 01:54.240
about this hair. I think as long as you say it- Pubes and all? Yes. No, yeah. I think as long as

01:54.240 --> 01:59.760
you say it as a statement of fact rather than, I'm Travis McElroy, right? Rather than, I'm Travis

01:59.760 --> 02:05.200
McElroy, don't make it sound like a question. Statement. I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin

02:05.200 --> 02:12.000
McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy, and I do hate my pubic hair. Griffin hates his pubes. I want to

02:12.000 --> 02:19.280
tell you guys a story. We often get into the email like a weird thing happened to me in the bathroom.

02:19.280 --> 02:26.480
What do I do? Am I good? Mostly. That's like 28% of the questions we get. Yes. I would like to share

02:26.480 --> 02:31.600
my own, and I want to preface by saying it's not blue. This is not, it's not a blue story. It's

02:31.600 --> 02:44.000
brown. Okay. Okay, Griffin. Justin, did you hear? Thank you. Play the noise. When dad and I flew

02:44.000 --> 02:50.400
into the Los Angeles airport for the Dungeons and Dragons live stream- A lot of weird bathroom users

02:50.400 --> 02:58.800
in there. Well, this was in the LAX bathroom. There was a line, men's room line, and I was

02:58.800 --> 03:04.640
nearing the front of the line. The person in front of me stepped to use the stall, and I hope to God,

03:04.640 --> 03:11.360
I presume an employee of the airport in a vest, I believe a turtleneck, and they had a laminated

03:11.360 --> 03:18.800
badge, stepped up, stepped in front of me, faced me, and said, number one or number two. Okay, so

03:18.800 --> 03:25.840
hold on. They had a turtleneck on? Yes. Was it like a uniform? Was it like LAX uniform? You have to

03:25.840 --> 03:32.400
wear a turtleneck like a Steve Jobs? Oh God, I hope so. Because the other option is just a

03:32.400 --> 03:39.040
passerby said either A, I'm going to help direct traffic, or B, I'm a big old bathroom pervert.

03:39.040 --> 03:44.640
It's one of those two. And looked me in the eye, another human, another human being looked me in

03:44.640 --> 03:49.200
my human eyes and said, number one or number two. It could be both. It could be both a

03:49.200 --> 03:53.520
bathroom pervert and an employee. It seems like a great job. I thought you were saying it can be

03:53.520 --> 03:57.600
number, both number one and number two, as it always is for me. I can't have one without the

03:57.600 --> 04:04.800
other. And so I said, number one, like without thinking, because I was so terrified. And it was

04:04.800 --> 04:10.640
number one. It was number one. And then this person simply directed me, as I said, number one,

04:11.680 --> 04:17.440
a urinal became open, and they directed me towards the urinal. And all I could think is like,

04:17.440 --> 04:23.280
that's what I would have done. What purpose? Why did you ask me? But then you look to the

04:23.280 --> 04:30.080
left and you saw an old, old man just having a shit in the urinal. And that's what you knew.

04:30.080 --> 04:35.200
I think what they were trying to solve for is a problem that happens in men's rooms all across

04:35.200 --> 04:40.480
this great land. And if you traditionally go to a bathroom that only has toilets and no urinals,

04:40.480 --> 04:46.560
you wouldn't be aware of this. When you go in, sometimes there's a bifurcation of the line.

04:46.560 --> 04:52.240
So there's urinals available, but no toilets available. And you're just kind of haunting.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.760
Oh, okay.

04:53.760 --> 04:57.440
It's going to be like that. It's going down like that. And you have to like wave

04:58.000 --> 05:04.880
other people onto the urinals. Like, go ahead. Yeah, that's no, I'm just going to go ahead.

05:04.880 --> 05:08.400
I'm going to wait for one of the little closets here.

05:08.400 --> 05:13.920
While I understand that, I still stand by that there is a better way to ask that question

05:13.920 --> 05:16.080
than number one or number two.

05:16.080 --> 05:22.000
I mean, I will, y'all have given this person way too much credit. This is a profoundly

05:22.000 --> 05:27.680
discriminatory, not inclusive thing, right? Like not everybody goes number one in a urinal.

05:27.680 --> 05:34.720
So fucking chill out, partner. Also, the other thing is, Travis, you should have just said like,

05:39.360 --> 05:44.000
I always forget which one they are and I have to make shitties.

05:44.000 --> 05:44.720
So can you tell me which one?

05:44.720 --> 05:46.000
I need to make dirt.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.280
I'm making a dirty mess. So can you tell me which one is it?

05:49.280 --> 05:51.600
I always forget.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.200
Which one do I make dirt in?

05:53.200 --> 05:56.000
I already made pissies on the plane and now I need to make shitties.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.920
Can you tell me which one it is?

05:57.920 --> 06:01.920
If somebody said number one or number two to me, you know what number I'd give them?

06:01.920 --> 06:06.880
38. That's my age of the years that I have. That's my number of years.

06:06.880 --> 06:07.040
Yeah.

06:07.040 --> 06:09.760
And I'm just going to go wherever I feel like going.

06:09.760 --> 06:13.040
We've got a big man with a big swirly gray mustache says,

06:13.040 --> 06:16.480
I'm a kindred spirit. I also make 38.

06:16.480 --> 06:21.600
I also need to go 38. And let me ask you, how do you get it out of your belly button?

06:23.600 --> 06:26.160
How do you polish the tool afterwards?

06:26.160 --> 06:29.760
He steps into a stall and just tendrils start shooting out of it.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.920
Like the birthing scene in Men in Black.

06:31.920 --> 06:36.000
You hear steam like whistling through some kind of steampunk device.

06:38.400 --> 06:42.800
Trav, you brought up the Dungeons and Dragons thing.

06:42.800 --> 06:47.680
I know you caught some FaceTime with some famos.

06:47.680 --> 06:48.000
I did.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.920
And I just want to know if you had any interactions.

06:51.920 --> 06:54.640
Did you get that Lillard stink on you?

06:54.640 --> 06:59.280
I did. He was nice. He was a very nice person, that Matthew Lillard.

07:00.640 --> 07:06.160
I had a lot of fun playing the Dungeons and or Dragons with everyone.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.520
I don't give a shit about that.

07:07.520 --> 07:08.640
Let me tell you about Joe Manganiello.

07:08.640 --> 07:10.480
I want to hear about famos or nothing.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.400
Yes. I'm going to tell you about Joe Manganiello.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.920
A mountain of a person.

07:14.640 --> 07:22.800
Perhaps the largest, just square footage wise, largest human being I have ever been beside.

07:22.800 --> 07:25.120
Yep. The fridge is what we call him.

07:25.120 --> 07:29.120
At one point, he stood in front of me and blocked out the sun.

07:33.040 --> 07:34.720
Listen, I'm not the biggest person in the world.

07:34.720 --> 07:39.520
I'm 5'10", but I'm a fairly broad 5'10".

07:39.520 --> 07:43.680
And I felt like a tiny child in his presence.

07:43.680 --> 07:46.480
Like, I think he could have juggled me.

07:48.000 --> 07:54.880
How many of his big D20s just turned into ash in his hand when he just crushed it with so many bones?

07:54.880 --> 07:58.560
I watched him try to eat a peanut butter cracker and it just turned to crumbs in his hand.

07:58.560 --> 08:00.400
And then he said, I wrecked it.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.320
And he started punching through buildings.

08:02.320 --> 08:02.560
Yeah.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.320
He's a dad figure.

08:06.320 --> 08:10.880
Dad showed me a picture of him with him and I said, oh, two dads.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.720
There's my two dads that I have.

08:12.720 --> 08:14.800
My dad and my real dad, my bio dad.

08:14.800 --> 08:16.800
My big bone crushing fridge dad.

08:16.800 --> 08:20.160
My big strong dad and my regular dad.

08:20.720 --> 08:22.080
Enough of this Hollywood bullshit.

08:22.640 --> 08:23.200
Thank you.

08:23.200 --> 08:23.680
Whoa.

08:23.680 --> 08:25.040
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

08:25.680 --> 08:26.240
Wait, really?

08:26.800 --> 08:27.760
Yeah, I am going to go to the bathroom.

08:27.760 --> 08:29.040
Number one and number two.

08:29.040 --> 08:29.920
Number one, Justin.

08:31.120 --> 08:31.840
Okay.

08:31.840 --> 08:33.840
This has been so fun, but I'll just be right back.

08:33.840 --> 08:38.560
Okay, I visited my grandmother over the weekend and we started to watch a show together.

08:38.560 --> 08:43.840
We watched two episodes before I left and promised to text about the episodes as we

08:43.840 --> 08:44.320
watched them.

08:44.880 --> 08:48.800
Problem is, from the third episode on, there have been many sex scenes, some of which are

08:48.800 --> 08:49.680
relevant to the plot.

08:50.320 --> 08:57.920
How can I binge a show and talk about it with my grandma when folks are blatantly getting

08:57.920 --> 08:58.320
it on?

08:58.320 --> 08:59.760
That's from Chaste in Chicago.

08:59.760 --> 09:07.360
And folks, if you don't start sending in fucking relevant information in these questions, I'm

09:07.360 --> 09:08.640
losing my mind right now.

09:08.640 --> 09:13.760
How on earth would you think we don't need to know what the show is, right?

09:13.760 --> 09:15.440
What if it's mad about you?

09:15.440 --> 09:18.480
And I'm supposed to talk about Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt.

09:18.480 --> 09:22.480
I've got all this great Reiser material, Reiser shine, etc.

09:22.480 --> 09:23.120
Yes.

09:23.120 --> 09:29.920
And I can't fucking do any of it because I don't know what show you're watching.

09:30.800 --> 09:34.720
Yeah, there's a lot of porking and mad about you.

09:34.720 --> 09:35.520
I'm going to email them.

09:35.520 --> 09:37.200
I'm going to email them right now.

09:37.200 --> 09:40.880
And let's find out if we get an answer by the end of the show if it is mad about you.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.680
Just send a, just send mad about you?

09:43.680 --> 09:44.240
Question mark?

09:45.920 --> 09:46.720
Twas it?

09:46.720 --> 09:47.680
Twas it?

09:47.680 --> 09:48.880
Twas it mad about you?

09:49.840 --> 09:50.320
Twas it?

09:50.320 --> 09:53.520
Um, first of all, don't be so close minded.

09:53.520 --> 09:59.760
Your mom's mom or dad's mom probably, I mean, they porked at some point and that's why you're

09:59.760 --> 10:00.560
here, right?

10:01.200 --> 10:07.280
In a roundabout way, their porking led to your parents porking, which led to you.

10:07.280 --> 10:10.720
Even if your parents happen to be adopted by this grandparent, I can't guarantee they

10:10.720 --> 10:11.440
porked at some point.

10:11.440 --> 10:12.320
They probably porked.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.840
Yeah, they probably did pork.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.400
That's a good thing to say.

10:16.400 --> 10:19.280
That's one good thing is like, I'm glad you did this probably.

10:19.280 --> 10:19.920
You know what I mean?

10:19.920 --> 10:23.600
Like, I'm glad that you probably, I'm glad you probably did this because otherwise I

10:23.600 --> 10:25.120
wouldn't be sharing this moment with you.

10:25.120 --> 10:29.520
Maybe like when you get to that sexy and like, text your grandma and say like, I really like

10:29.520 --> 10:33.680
this episode, but I was confused by that one scene where they seem to be just slamming

10:33.680 --> 10:35.280
their bodies into each other.

10:35.280 --> 10:36.080
What's that about?

10:36.080 --> 10:41.040
They were really slapping shanks and I'm not quite sure what the purpose of that was, grandma.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.480
So tell me now.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.400
What was even happening there?

10:44.400 --> 10:44.960
What's that?

10:44.960 --> 10:45.760
What is that?

10:46.800 --> 10:47.840
Did that hurt them?

10:47.840 --> 10:49.520
Did that hurt them?

10:49.520 --> 10:51.760
They seem to be in pain of some sort.

10:51.760 --> 10:52.880
I couldn't place it.

10:52.880 --> 10:53.920
Are they okay?

10:53.920 --> 10:57.200
They seem to be laying down in bed, but very exhausted.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.880
So please tell me why it was.

10:58.880 --> 10:59.760
Did they run?

10:59.760 --> 11:00.320
Are they okay?

11:01.680 --> 11:02.560
What happened?

11:02.560 --> 11:03.760
Is it a sickness?

11:03.760 --> 11:05.840
Justin, are you done drafting the email?

11:05.840 --> 11:07.360
Yeah, the email has been sent.

11:07.360 --> 11:07.840
All right.

11:07.840 --> 11:08.400
And now we wait.

11:08.400 --> 11:09.360
Chased in Chicago.

11:09.360 --> 11:13.680
Option two, you text your grandma and be like, I really like this episode, especially the

11:13.680 --> 11:14.400
part where they fucked.

11:15.120 --> 11:15.600
Or you could just-

11:15.600 --> 11:16.640
No, that's nothing.

11:16.640 --> 11:17.680
That's not helpful.

11:17.680 --> 11:19.840
Yeah, sometimes you just say stuff that's not helpful.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.680
And it's a joke of how bad helpful it is.

11:21.680 --> 11:22.800
Then what would you do?

11:22.800 --> 11:27.120
I mean, unless it was like, you know, Skinamax.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.560
I bet there was stuff that happened in the episode that was not slapping shanks.

11:31.680 --> 11:35.280
But then you would worry, like if you said, like, I thought the car chase was really good

11:35.280 --> 11:37.600
and all that negotiation scene was so tense.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.320
And then grandma writes back, like, what'd you think about the fucking?

11:40.880 --> 11:42.560
Then you are probably in the clear.

11:42.560 --> 11:44.160
And this question doesn't matter anymore, Travis.

11:44.160 --> 11:46.080
I would argue that that is best case scenario.

11:46.080 --> 11:49.360
Okay, then what if it's a little more subtle and it's just like, what do you think about

11:49.360 --> 11:50.160
the rest of it?

11:51.120 --> 11:52.480
And then a winky face of a-

11:52.480 --> 11:54.800
And then a winky face and maybe like an eggplant.

11:54.800 --> 11:58.400
An emoji of two ham shanks that are moving in together.

11:58.400 --> 11:59.840
They're slapping together one might say.

11:59.840 --> 12:02.560
Oh, I thought you like maybe got like an apartment together.

12:03.280 --> 12:04.800
Maybe like, what about this?

12:04.800 --> 12:05.840
Oopsie snack time.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.520
Saying something like that to your grandma when the sex starts.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.440
Like, oops, oops-a-daisy snack time.

12:11.440 --> 12:14.080
I don't know if you're syncing up your watch, are you?

12:14.080 --> 12:16.400
Yeah, I don't know if you're live texting it.

12:18.400 --> 12:19.680
That was what I imagined.

12:19.680 --> 12:20.800
Why else would you text?

12:21.760 --> 12:24.160
Text about the episodes as we watch them.

12:24.160 --> 12:24.880
So wait a minute.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.560
I'm just going to get a bunch of fuck.

12:26.560 --> 12:32.480
I'll be middle of my day and my grandma is going to be like, oh man, I'll tell you what,

12:32.480 --> 12:35.600
the rock has really got these ballers around his finger, huh?

12:35.600 --> 12:37.280
Anyway, I can't believe he went to this-

12:37.280 --> 12:38.720
Wait, did you get the answer back?

12:38.720 --> 12:39.200
Is it ballers?

12:39.200 --> 12:40.560
Did you get the answer back?

12:40.560 --> 12:41.360
No, I don't know.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.240
It's just a guess.

12:42.240 --> 12:43.120
It seems the right.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.680
It's, it felt good in the moment.

12:45.680 --> 12:46.320
Yeah, grandma's like ballers.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.800
I sure hope that R-E and E hug it out.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.320
I'm betting it's either ballers or entourage.

12:52.320 --> 12:52.880
That's my bet.

12:52.880 --> 12:53.600
You think it might be entourage?

12:53.600 --> 12:55.120
It's definitely ballers.

12:56.480 --> 12:58.160
It feels like it's probably ballers.

12:58.160 --> 12:58.640
Okay.

12:58.640 --> 13:00.560
A show that may only exist.

13:00.560 --> 13:04.800
I feel like ballers, okay, I feel this way about a lot of entertainment programming,

13:04.800 --> 13:11.360
but I feel this way definitely about ballers where it's like a fake, it's like a facade.

13:11.360 --> 13:15.040
Yeah, and if I walked in through the front, like on a sound stage,

13:15.040 --> 13:17.200
if I walked in through the front door of ballers,

13:17.200 --> 13:23.680
it would just be two by four supports and paint, paint claws and everything.

13:23.680 --> 13:25.440
Like there's no actual show in there.

13:25.440 --> 13:30.400
Like you're not actually, like they only shoot enough to do like the montage

13:30.400 --> 13:33.680
of please don't cancel your HBO because Game of Thrones ended.

13:33.680 --> 13:34.960
We got lots of other things.

13:34.960 --> 13:38.000
It's like at some point, like somebody said to Dwayne The Rock Johnson,

13:38.000 --> 13:39.360
like, hey, we're good friends, right?

13:39.360 --> 13:42.640
Will you come see my community theater production of Cats or something?

13:42.640 --> 13:48.720
And Dwayne The Rock Johnson said, I can't, I'm in a new show that I need to film.

13:48.720 --> 13:50.160
And they're like, oh, what's the show about?

13:50.160 --> 13:52.960
It's like, it's called Ballers.

13:53.760 --> 13:55.360
And it's a real show.

13:55.360 --> 13:56.320
It's definitely a real show.

13:56.320 --> 13:58.640
And then they're like, well, I can't wait to see previews for it.

13:58.640 --> 14:00.880
He was like, oh, and then he had to go to someone and said,

14:00.880 --> 14:04.880
please help me make previews, but we can't say what day or time it's on.

14:04.880 --> 14:06.560
We don't want people to watch it.

14:06.560 --> 14:10.000
And so it only exists in preview form.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.440
Okay, so just a quick update.

14:11.440 --> 14:16.160
I am looking at a Vulture recap of season one, episode three of Ballers,

14:16.160 --> 14:18.000
which would be the inciting episode.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.200
It's called Move the Chains.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.240
And here's just a little excerpt from their recap.

14:22.240 --> 14:24.720
Thanks to this episode, I practically see Reggie's whole arc

14:24.720 --> 14:26.080
mapped out for the rest of the season.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.000
While he claims to be looking out for his boy Vernon,

14:28.000 --> 14:30.560
even telling Spencer he's mostly pissed that he wasn't consulted

14:30.560 --> 14:32.960
about the ideas that he had for his friend and his brand,

14:32.960 --> 14:35.120
we later learned that that's all bullshit.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.600
And then more stuff, more stuff, more stuff, next paragraph.

14:37.600 --> 14:38.960
But enough about Reggie.

14:38.960 --> 14:42.240
Let's get to Ricky smashing Alonzo's mom.

14:42.240 --> 14:44.800
So it seems like maybe this is Ballers.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.000
It could be Ballers.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.240
Because I think episode three is the episode,

14:48.240 --> 14:51.600
if I remember correctly, let me go through my notes.

14:51.600 --> 14:54.320
This is the one where Ricky does smash Alonzo's mom.

14:55.680 --> 14:57.040
So it could be Ballers.

14:57.040 --> 15:01.040
Can you just text your grandma about the artistry, right?

15:01.040 --> 15:02.480
I'm really believing this.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.240
This is appropriate.

15:04.240 --> 15:06.880
I love the lighting, you know, like that kind of thing.

15:06.880 --> 15:09.280
Oh, it seems like they hired an intimacy director.

15:09.280 --> 15:11.040
This seems very realistic.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.320
Is that a dog?

15:12.320 --> 15:12.820
Yeah.

15:13.360 --> 15:14.320
Is that a dog?

15:14.320 --> 15:15.680
How do you think I'm feeding my family?

15:15.680 --> 15:16.320
Podcasts?

15:17.360 --> 15:19.040
It's like a fight choreographer, Griffin,

15:19.040 --> 15:21.280
but instead of the two ham shanks punching each other,

15:21.280 --> 15:23.040
you choreographed the two ham shanks.

15:23.040 --> 15:23.680
Stop, stop, stop.

15:23.680 --> 15:25.760
You guys know more about movies and drama and theater

15:25.760 --> 15:27.920
and the arts than I do because you went to college

15:27.920 --> 15:29.040
for some of that stuff.

15:29.040 --> 15:29.680
Yes.

15:29.680 --> 15:30.960
Is this a real joke you're telling me

15:30.960 --> 15:32.800
or is this dry olive garden pasta?

15:32.800 --> 15:34.080
No, this is a real thing.

15:34.960 --> 15:38.320
Intimacy director is hired to choreograph love scenes

15:38.320 --> 15:40.160
and really any kind of physical intimacy.

15:40.160 --> 15:41.600
Love scenes!

15:41.600 --> 15:43.520
Yes, love scenes, Griffin.

15:43.520 --> 15:46.400
Not just physical love, but perhaps other kinds of love

15:46.400 --> 15:50.240
so that everyone on set feels comfortable and it's realistic.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.520
I think that that's important, right?

15:51.520 --> 15:52.800
Making sure everybody feels comfortable.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.960
I just am imagining something to be like,

15:54.960 --> 15:56.720
you guys know what Porkin's all about.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.480
I think that's the opposite of them making everyone

16:00.480 --> 16:01.520
feel comfortable, Griffin.

16:01.520 --> 16:04.800
The reason Griffin had a hard time believing

16:04.800 --> 16:07.600
that intimacy coordinator is a real thing

16:07.600 --> 16:09.920
is because Rob Schneider did not make a movie

16:09.920 --> 16:10.720
where he stars as a-

16:11.520 --> 16:11.920
Right?

16:11.920 --> 16:15.680
I mean, because of the absence of the Rob Schneider movie,

16:15.680 --> 16:19.760
like the Pork Doctor or whatever the fuck he'd call it.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.840
I mean, it would be the Sexspert, which is unfortunate

16:23.840 --> 16:24.880
because that'd be our brand.

16:24.880 --> 16:26.080
It sucks for Travis especially.

16:26.080 --> 16:27.360
Drunk through the mud.

16:27.360 --> 16:29.280
But that's why he had a hard time believing it

16:29.280 --> 16:31.280
because it's not a Rob Schneider movie already.

16:31.280 --> 16:33.040
I just, now that you've explained why,

16:33.040 --> 16:33.840
it makes a lot of sense.

16:33.840 --> 16:35.120
I think it's an important role.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.640
But my brain immediately went to,

16:38.000 --> 16:39.840
so you guys ever done kissing?

16:40.560 --> 16:40.960
Kissing.

16:42.160 --> 16:42.800
How about a Yahoo?

16:43.520 --> 16:44.400
Yeah, I'd love that, Griff.

16:44.400 --> 16:44.800
Thank you.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.480
I have a miniature one here.

16:46.480 --> 16:48.320
It's not gonna be a good jump have for discussion,

16:48.320 --> 16:50.480
but when I read it, I laughed for like a minute straight.

16:50.480 --> 16:51.600
It made me very happy.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.080
Jack sent this one on Thinks Jack.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.800
It's Yahoo Answers user, Greta, with all caps.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.360
Greta, who's a very recent member.

16:59.360 --> 17:05.520
Greta asks, I have a TV that talk, but no picture?

17:07.200 --> 17:07.520
Huh?

17:08.240 --> 17:10.480
I have a TV that talk, but no picture.

17:12.880 --> 17:14.000
My TV talks.

17:14.800 --> 17:18.640
My TV does talk, but it doesn't produce picture.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.920
It talks the sound of the show.

17:23.680 --> 17:26.000
The thing is, I think it's easy to assume

17:26.000 --> 17:27.840
that you're hearing the sounds from TV,

17:27.840 --> 17:30.480
but Griffin, well, that's the TV just talks.

17:32.240 --> 17:34.160
Okay, let's get into this, yeah.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.360
I've been watching The Americans and Keri Russell

17:37.360 --> 17:39.520
sometimes speak American on that show.

17:39.520 --> 17:40.720
Sometimes they'll speak English,

17:40.720 --> 17:41.840
sometimes they'll speak Russian,

17:41.840 --> 17:43.440
but you're saying that it's the TV.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.640
Uh-huh, and it's just like, hello, Greta.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.320
It could be the TV.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.120
We don't know for sure.

17:51.120 --> 17:53.280
And you like TV, because here's the thing,

17:53.280 --> 17:55.760
my Amazon Alexa talks to me sometimes.

17:55.760 --> 17:57.440
What if this just went a step further

17:57.440 --> 17:59.280
and was just like, hey, Greta, and you're like,

17:59.280 --> 18:01.360
hey, TV, please turn on picture.

18:01.360 --> 18:02.960
And the TV was like, no.

18:03.760 --> 18:04.480
And you're like, what?

18:06.160 --> 18:07.520
The screen's all fucked up,

18:07.520 --> 18:12.000
but they're in the big throne room,

18:12.000 --> 18:14.400
and the dragon seems very angry,

18:14.400 --> 18:15.360
and you know what?

18:15.360 --> 18:18.160
I do want actually my spin on the Game of Thrones finale

18:18.160 --> 18:21.440
because it could be a softened sort of blow.

18:22.560 --> 18:23.840
Would you enjoy that, Greta?

18:23.840 --> 18:27.760
Uh, no, TV, I think I'd just rather watch it.

18:27.760 --> 18:29.600
Could you show it to me?

18:29.600 --> 18:31.600
This part's dirty.

18:32.560 --> 18:36.560
Your mom told me to not let you see the dirty parts.

18:36.560 --> 18:37.920
So this part's dirty.

18:37.920 --> 18:38.880
It's totally fine.

18:38.880 --> 18:41.120
My mom left, but before she did,

18:41.120 --> 18:44.080
she said, and tell TV it's okay to see the dirty parts.

18:44.080 --> 18:45.520
So Greta's watching.

18:45.520 --> 18:46.880
It's really dirty, though.

18:48.160 --> 18:51.200
Greta's watching Ballers episode three

18:51.200 --> 18:55.520
and fucking Denny's walking up towards Alonso's mom

18:55.520 --> 18:56.800
and starts to pull his pants down.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.000
The screen just cuts to black,

18:58.000 --> 18:59.840
and Greta's like, what the fuck?

18:59.840 --> 19:00.640
And then Greta's like,

19:00.640 --> 19:02.960
uh, he pulled his pants right back up.

19:02.960 --> 19:04.160
He pulled them right back up.

19:04.160 --> 19:05.040
He pulled them right back up.

19:05.040 --> 19:06.640
And then he took her up for ice cream.

19:06.640 --> 19:07.920
Took her to Wendy's.

19:07.920 --> 19:08.960
They got a Frosty together.

19:08.960 --> 19:09.680
He took her home.

19:09.680 --> 19:15.040
He pulled his pants up and said, I gotta get to church.

19:15.040 --> 19:16.720
And then that was the end of the scene.

19:19.120 --> 19:20.080
Do you have a real Yahoo?

19:20.080 --> 19:21.360
Uh, yeah, sure.

19:21.360 --> 19:24.160
Here's one that was sent in by Jeremy S.

19:24.160 --> 19:25.280
Important science question.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.400
We're very good at these.

19:26.400 --> 19:27.040
Thanks, Jeremy.

19:27.040 --> 19:29.760
It's Yahoo Answers user, Lana, who does ask,

19:29.760 --> 19:31.600
what happens if you eat pudding mix

19:31.600 --> 19:33.120
and then drink a bunch of milk?

19:33.120 --> 19:35.200
Does it turn to pudding in your stomach?

19:36.240 --> 19:38.400
Well, not if you don't shake around a bunch.

19:39.040 --> 19:40.480
You gotta shake around a whole bunch.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.280
Come on.

19:42.080 --> 19:45.920
Get one of those old timey shaky belts that they have

19:45.920 --> 19:51.280
on like funny TV shows about like how whack old stuff was

19:51.840 --> 19:54.480
and give it to jiggle and jiggle and jiggle year round.

19:54.480 --> 19:56.400
And then, I guess you'll die.

19:56.400 --> 20:00.000
It's not, yeah, you'll probably, no, you'll be fine.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.040
I mean, first off, I bet it would taste pretty good

20:03.040 --> 20:05.360
in that same way that like that dirty way

20:05.360 --> 20:09.920
where if you get a big chunk of chocolate milk mix,

20:09.920 --> 20:10.400
you know what I mean?

20:10.400 --> 20:12.080
Oh, you like that?

20:12.080 --> 20:12.800
Yeah, it's good.

20:12.800 --> 20:13.600
I like that.

20:13.600 --> 20:14.640
I think that that's good.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.320
I don't like it.

20:16.320 --> 20:17.680
Really, okay.

20:17.680 --> 20:18.480
It's powdery.

20:19.600 --> 20:20.640
Yeah, okay.

20:21.920 --> 20:23.040
I like the marshmallows.

20:24.560 --> 20:26.160
In chocolate milk mix?

20:27.200 --> 20:29.280
Yeah, sometimes they have marshmallows in them.

20:29.280 --> 20:29.780
Do they?

20:30.400 --> 20:34.240
Seems like maybe you've never had chocolate milk mix, Griffin.

20:34.240 --> 20:35.840
I thought you said hot chocolate.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.840
You did not think he said that.

20:37.840 --> 20:38.320
He didn't think I said that.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.000
He twice, he repeated himself.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.800
I shoot chocolate milk all the fucking time.

20:42.800 --> 20:43.280
Child.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.720
Uh-huh.

20:44.720 --> 20:46.640
When was the last time you had chocolate milk?

20:46.640 --> 20:46.880
Now.

20:46.880 --> 20:47.600
From a mix.

20:47.600 --> 20:48.720
From a mix.

20:48.720 --> 20:49.040
Right.

20:49.040 --> 20:49.600
From a mix.

20:49.600 --> 20:49.840
Right.

20:50.880 --> 20:52.000
Oh, you're having it now, you said.

20:52.000 --> 20:52.560
I'm having it right now.

20:52.560 --> 20:53.040
Shit, listen.

20:56.000 --> 20:56.720
You're loving it.

21:00.240 --> 21:01.040
Wait, what is happening?

21:01.040 --> 21:05.760
This is sonically, this is sonically the worst part of my life.

21:05.760 --> 21:07.600
I don't care for this at all.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.960
This one afternoon, this one May afternoon when I was 38

21:10.960 --> 21:12.800
was sonically the worst thing that ever happened.

21:12.800 --> 21:13.440
Oh, that's weird.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.760
I thought you liked chocolate milk mix because that's the sound it makes.

21:15.760 --> 21:17.120
That's weird that you fucking said that.

21:18.880 --> 21:21.360
I've read the instructions for pudding a lot.

21:21.360 --> 21:23.760
I've made my fair share of pudding, not to brag.

21:24.560 --> 21:25.440
I made my fair share of pudding.

21:25.440 --> 21:28.800
But you prefer British pudding, the proper the Queen's pudding.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.280
A delicious pud.

21:31.840 --> 21:35.760
Listen, I love a pud and I love to make a pud.

21:35.760 --> 21:39.040
No, actually, judging by the leftovers I have every Christmas,

21:39.040 --> 21:41.360
empirically, we don't all love a pudding.

21:41.360 --> 21:45.360
Some people would prefer to leave the pudding where it is

21:45.360 --> 21:47.680
and maybe at the store bought key lime pie.

21:47.680 --> 21:49.520
I bought two anyway.

21:49.520 --> 21:51.680
I don't want to get hung up on a lot of Christmas angst,

21:51.680 --> 21:56.160
but not once have I seen in the directions

21:56.160 --> 22:01.120
and also include a bunch of fucking stomach acid

22:01.120 --> 22:03.600
and bile into the into the equation.

22:03.600 --> 22:05.040
That's not part of the recipe.

22:05.040 --> 22:06.560
Just because you have two of the components

22:06.560 --> 22:08.800
doesn't mean we're not going to wang it with some extra ones.

22:08.800 --> 22:13.840
I also would say, while I appreciate the scientific nature of this question,

22:14.560 --> 22:18.800
you're missing out on the enjoyment of the pudding.

22:18.800 --> 22:22.080
Like if this did work, you wouldn't mix it together in your tummy

22:22.080 --> 22:24.160
and then like say like, mmm.

22:26.320 --> 22:27.840
It would not become pudding.

22:27.840 --> 22:28.800
Now I have pudding.

22:28.800 --> 22:29.120
Right.

22:29.120 --> 22:32.080
It wouldn't become pudding at the point at which it is important

22:32.080 --> 22:35.600
that it is pudding, which is just, if not more so,

22:35.600 --> 22:37.440
prior to going in your mouth.

22:37.440 --> 22:38.880
Have you had pudding today?

22:38.880 --> 22:39.840
Not yet.

22:39.840 --> 22:42.400
But give me a second and then I will have had pudding.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.480
Let me throw myself down this set of stairs

22:44.480 --> 22:45.680
and then I will have had pudding.

22:45.680 --> 22:46.800
Let me shake up my tummy.

22:46.800 --> 22:47.300
Right.

22:47.840 --> 22:51.840
Roll me down this meadow, this buttercup covered hill

22:51.840 --> 22:54.640
and perhaps at the bottom of it, I will have had pudding today.

22:54.640 --> 22:57.280
Put me in this big barrel and roll me over the falls

22:57.280 --> 22:59.280
and then there will have been pudding the whole time.

22:59.280 --> 23:00.400
Put me in coach.

23:00.400 --> 23:01.760
I'm ready to make pudding today.

23:01.760 --> 23:07.360
There are very few foods where the flavor or texture of it

23:08.320 --> 23:09.600
isn't designed for the mouth.

23:09.600 --> 23:10.560
You guys ever think about that?

23:12.560 --> 23:13.600
Wait, what?

23:14.640 --> 23:15.920
There are very few foods

23:17.120 --> 23:19.600
where the flavor isn't designed for the mouth.

23:19.600 --> 23:20.960
Where the flavor and texture of it

23:22.320 --> 23:24.640
is designed to be enjoyed once it's in your belly.

23:24.640 --> 23:26.080
Like that's the peak of it.

23:26.080 --> 23:26.640
All right.

23:26.640 --> 23:28.800
Yeah, there's booze.

23:28.800 --> 23:31.120
Yeah, that's one of them.

23:31.120 --> 23:32.240
But I wouldn't say that's a food.

23:32.240 --> 23:34.160
And I think if you do think that's a food, that sucks.

23:34.160 --> 23:38.000
But I would say any carbonated beverage

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
where once again a beverage isn't a food, I get that.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.120
But where you're almost guaranteed to make burpees.

23:41.120 --> 23:43.280
You guys are really throwing up some real fucking air balls

23:43.280 --> 23:44.480
right now, some real bricks.

23:44.480 --> 23:46.480
Yeah, you fill a person with milk,

23:46.480 --> 23:48.320
you fill a person with pudding mix,

23:48.320 --> 23:50.000
you shake them around, they're full of pudding.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.920
You know who I bet wishes that worked?

23:51.920 --> 23:58.320
Bears.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.320
Bears and sharks.

24:00.320 --> 24:02.320
What are you eating, dude?

24:02.320 --> 24:04.320
Well, it's a guy, but it's also fudgy gushers.

24:04.320 --> 24:06.320
It's a guy.

24:06.320 --> 24:08.320
It is a guy.

24:08.320 --> 24:10.320
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:10.320 --> 24:12.320
This is a pudding boy.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.320
Did you guys not have pudding in yours?

24:14.320 --> 24:16.320
Careful, Kevin, I know what to do.

24:16.320 --> 24:18.320
Stand perfectly still.

24:18.320 --> 24:20.320
No, Kevin, here's what you do.

24:20.320 --> 24:22.320
All right, so you're gonna take

24:22.320 --> 24:24.320
all this jello pudding mix.

24:24.320 --> 24:26.320
You're gonna eat it up good.

24:26.320 --> 24:28.320
Trust me, Kevin, it's the only way.

24:28.320 --> 24:30.320
It'll really drive me off or whatever.

24:30.320 --> 24:32.320
Oh, I hate what you're doing.

24:32.320 --> 24:34.320
And then the milk, Kevin.

24:34.320 --> 24:36.320
All the milk, all the milk, all the milk.

24:36.320 --> 24:38.320
Keep going.

24:38.320 --> 24:40.320
Now shake it.

24:40.320 --> 24:42.320
Now do I stand perfectly still?

24:42.320 --> 24:44.320
No, Kevin, quite the opposite.

24:44.320 --> 24:46.320
You're gonna shake it like a Polaroid picture, Kevin.

24:46.320 --> 24:48.320
Just jiggle and jiggle.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.320
Sorry, Kevin.

24:50.320 --> 24:52.320
Can I go?

24:52.320 --> 24:54.320
Yeah, Dylan, you can go.

24:54.320 --> 24:56.320
I'm out of pudding mix.

24:56.320 --> 24:58.320
Yeah, this is the only pudding mix I need.

24:58.320 --> 25:00.320
Munch, munch, munch.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.320
Yeah, and then the boy gets eaten.

25:02.320 --> 25:04.320
I wanted to jump over that part

25:04.320 --> 25:06.320
because it makes me sad.

25:06.320 --> 25:08.320
That part's sad, but at the last second

25:08.320 --> 25:10.320
the bear doesn't do it

25:10.320 --> 25:12.320
because he remembers he has diabetes.

25:12.320 --> 25:14.320
Oh, the last one that he remembers.

25:14.320 --> 25:16.320
Oh, no.

25:16.320 --> 25:18.320
Do you want a yahoo?

25:18.320 --> 25:20.320
Well, let's do another question real quick.

25:20.320 --> 25:22.320
That'll be our third yahoo.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.320
It seems a little bit unnecessary.

25:24.320 --> 25:26.320
We'll do six yahoo's in a row.

25:26.320 --> 25:28.320
Let's do another question then.

25:28.320 --> 25:30.320
Here's a quick question.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.320
Whenever I get my hair washed at a salon,

25:32.320 --> 25:34.320
I close my eyes because I don't want to make eye contact with the stylist.

25:34.320 --> 25:36.320
Oh, perfectly normal.

25:36.320 --> 25:38.320
I'm worried the stylist will think I'm some perv

25:38.320 --> 25:40.320
if I close my eyes,

25:40.320 --> 25:42.320
but I'm also worried it'll be worse if I look.

25:42.320 --> 25:44.320
Oh, man.

25:44.320 --> 25:46.320
That's the same reason.

25:46.320 --> 25:48.320
Is that weird? Am I creepy?

25:48.320 --> 25:50.320
If you walked into a salon

25:50.320 --> 25:52.320
and saw someone with their eyes closed getting a haircut,

25:52.320 --> 25:54.320
what would you do?

25:54.320 --> 25:56.320
That's from Eyes Wide Shut in Shanghai.

25:56.320 --> 25:58.320
Cool.

25:58.320 --> 26:00.320
I don't think we've ever had a question from Shanghai before.

26:00.320 --> 26:02.320
That's neat.

26:02.320 --> 26:04.320
I think, and I don't know,

26:04.320 --> 26:06.320
maybe I'm in the wrong here,

26:06.320 --> 26:08.320
but I think it's way weirder

26:08.320 --> 26:10.320
to be sitting there

26:10.320 --> 26:12.320
because you have two options if you keep your eyes open.

26:12.320 --> 26:14.320
You can go straight ahead,

26:14.320 --> 26:16.320
which is, after a long period of time,

26:16.320 --> 26:18.320
weird,

26:18.320 --> 26:20.320
to track what they're doing with your eyes,

26:20.320 --> 26:22.320
which is even weirder.

26:22.320 --> 26:24.320
All right.

26:24.320 --> 26:26.320
Hey, everybody.

26:26.320 --> 26:28.320
Eye contact. Unbroken eye contact.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.320
That's no good.

26:30.320 --> 26:32.320
There's only another way.

26:32.320 --> 26:34.320
Everybody, on a monthly basis,

26:34.320 --> 26:36.320
you have to come to me

26:36.320 --> 26:38.320
and sit down in front of me,

26:38.320 --> 26:40.320
supplicating yourself to me,

26:40.320 --> 26:42.320
while I touch your hair for a half hour.

26:42.320 --> 26:44.320
In this situation,

26:44.320 --> 26:46.320
there are infinite,

26:46.320 --> 26:48.320
imaginable vectors

26:48.320 --> 26:50.320
through which things can become uncomfortable.

26:50.320 --> 26:52.320
I think that's fair to say.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.320
This scenario,

26:54.320 --> 26:56.320
getting the haircut,

26:56.320 --> 26:58.320
it can be very uncomfortable,

26:58.320 --> 27:00.320
which is why, for me,

27:00.320 --> 27:02.320
I have had the same hairstylist now for a few years.

27:02.320 --> 27:04.320
It's one of the longer streaks I've had with a hairstylist.

27:04.320 --> 27:06.320
She does a great job cutting my hair,

27:06.320 --> 27:08.320
but the reason I decided to stay

27:08.320 --> 27:10.320
is because I had found comfort there.

27:10.320 --> 27:12.320
I had found a routine that was comfortable.

27:12.320 --> 27:14.320
It's a huge selling point.

27:14.320 --> 27:16.320
So I don't think we...

27:16.320 --> 27:18.320
I don't think this is...

27:18.320 --> 27:20.320
This is not, like, a travesty, right?

27:20.320 --> 27:22.320
Like, this person closes their eyes when they get a haircut.

27:22.320 --> 27:24.320
I'm sure that your hairstylist has seen weirder things

27:24.320 --> 27:26.320
because it's an inherently strange

27:26.320 --> 27:28.320
human flaw

27:28.320 --> 27:30.320
that these weird,

27:30.320 --> 27:32.320
sticky, itchy things

27:32.320 --> 27:34.320
keep coming out of our heads

27:34.320 --> 27:36.320
and other parts of our body

27:36.320 --> 27:38.320
and I wish they just would stop for, like, a minute

27:38.320 --> 27:40.320
so I could get a handle on it.

27:40.320 --> 27:42.320
I think you've just made...

27:42.320 --> 27:44.320
This is, I think, a fun thing

27:44.320 --> 27:46.320
that you could do to break the ice

27:46.320 --> 27:48.320
with a new hairstylist

27:48.320 --> 27:50.320
is you sit down and, you know,

27:50.320 --> 27:52.320
there's a little bit of tension, you know,

27:52.320 --> 27:54.320
because it's new and you don't want to talk about...

27:54.320 --> 27:56.320
The first time they cut hair, scream in pain.

27:56.320 --> 27:58.320
Oh! That's interesting.

27:58.320 --> 28:00.320
And then you're both gonna have a good laugh about that

28:00.320 --> 28:02.320
because they're gonna jump

28:02.320 --> 28:04.320
or you say, like,

28:04.320 --> 28:06.320
and I have a minute, and then you say an individual goodbye

28:06.320 --> 28:08.320
to each hair they've just cut.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.320
They make the second cut, you do it again.

28:10.320 --> 28:12.320
You repeat that over and over again.

28:12.320 --> 28:14.320
What if you have a bunch of little

28:14.320 --> 28:16.320
bones sticking out of your scalp

28:16.320 --> 28:18.320
mixed in with your hair?

28:18.320 --> 28:20.320
Oh, that's fun.

28:20.320 --> 28:22.320
Just to mix it up like you're

28:22.320 --> 28:24.320
King Koopa from the Super Mario Brothers movie.

28:24.320 --> 28:26.320
I like that.

28:26.320 --> 28:28.320
Maybe you have a few Double Dare flags in there.

28:28.320 --> 28:30.320
Cool.

28:30.320 --> 28:32.320
And so as they're digging around, they find one,

28:32.320 --> 28:34.320
and you're like, you're on a space ship.

28:34.320 --> 28:36.320
Maybe as they cut it shorter and shorter,

28:36.320 --> 28:38.320
you've written a message on your scalp

28:38.320 --> 28:40.320
that says, like, too short.

28:40.320 --> 28:42.320
Too short.

28:42.320 --> 28:44.320
Start over. Try again.

28:44.320 --> 28:46.320
Maybe one thing you could do

28:46.320 --> 28:48.320
would be to,

28:48.320 --> 28:50.320
as the haircut progresses,

28:50.320 --> 28:52.320
continually compare yourself

28:52.320 --> 28:54.320
to other celebrities.

28:54.320 --> 28:56.320
Like, oh, nice.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.320
Just like Eddie from the Munsters.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.320
Or, oh, nice.

29:00.320 --> 29:02.320
Patrick from Spongebob.

29:02.320 --> 29:04.320
Just continually, he doesn't have hair,

29:04.320 --> 29:06.320
so that wasn't ideal, but you get the idea.

29:06.320 --> 29:08.320
That's really great.

29:08.320 --> 29:10.320
Just like Lance Henderson

29:10.320 --> 29:12.320
in Aliens.

29:12.320 --> 29:14.320
I think giving the hairstylist

29:14.320 --> 29:16.320
an activity to do while they're cutting,

29:16.320 --> 29:18.320
as we are suggesting universally here,

29:18.320 --> 29:20.320
giving them something to occupy themselves,

29:20.320 --> 29:22.320
like a child on a road trip,

29:22.320 --> 29:24.320
is definitely the right way to go.

29:24.320 --> 29:26.320
So you can just close your eyes

29:26.320 --> 29:28.320
and have a good anxiety nap.

29:28.320 --> 29:30.320
Mm-hmm.

29:30.320 --> 29:32.320
Here's all I'm saying.

29:34.320 --> 29:36.320
I used to talk a lot on this show

29:36.320 --> 29:38.320
about social anxiety, right?

29:38.320 --> 29:40.320
Before you've gone, cool!

29:40.320 --> 29:42.320
Yay!

29:42.320 --> 29:44.320
Now, no.

29:44.320 --> 29:46.320
Now, I think,

29:46.320 --> 29:48.320
I don't think of people

29:48.320 --> 29:50.320
who have social anxiety

29:50.320 --> 29:52.320
and don't know what to say.

29:52.320 --> 29:54.320
I don't think those people exist anymore.

29:54.320 --> 29:56.320
You know how I label them now?

29:56.320 --> 29:58.320
Ooh.

29:58.320 --> 30:00.320
If you have memorized...

30:00.320 --> 30:02.320
Hear me out.

30:02.320 --> 30:04.320
If you've memorized 50 riddles,

30:04.320 --> 30:06.320
you'll never be

30:06.320 --> 30:08.320
in a conversation or social situation

30:08.320 --> 30:10.320
where you don't know the perfect

30:10.320 --> 30:12.320
thing to say, because it's probably

30:12.320 --> 30:14.320
a riddle.

30:14.320 --> 30:16.320
One of your 50 riddles, yeah.

30:16.320 --> 30:18.320
One of the 50 riddles you know,

30:18.320 --> 30:20.320
one of them is probably somewhat applicable

30:20.320 --> 30:22.320
to the situation.

30:22.320 --> 30:24.320
There's no such thing as comfortable

30:24.320 --> 30:26.320
socially. There's people who are comfortable

30:26.320 --> 30:28.320
socially and people who haven't memorized

30:28.320 --> 30:30.320
50 riddles. So then...

30:30.320 --> 30:32.320
Because if you've memorized 50 riddles,

30:32.320 --> 30:34.320
that is going to be the perfect icebreaker.

30:34.320 --> 30:36.320
It's fun. What a fun brain

30:36.320 --> 30:38.320
teaser. While I'm cutting hair,

30:38.320 --> 30:40.320
I get to like, you know,

30:40.320 --> 30:42.320
try to unravel

30:42.320 --> 30:44.320
your mysteries.

30:44.320 --> 30:46.320
Right. I think it would be great

30:46.320 --> 30:48.320
to memorize some riddles. And then...

30:48.320 --> 30:50.320
An added benefit, if you find somebody

30:50.320 --> 30:52.320
who has memorized the exact same

30:52.320 --> 30:54.320
50 riddles as you, you marry

30:54.320 --> 30:56.320
them. That's another option.

30:56.320 --> 30:58.320
That's how you know. Or if you see your

30:58.320 --> 31:00.320
hairstylist for long enough,

31:00.320 --> 31:02.320
when they finally solve that 50th

31:02.320 --> 31:04.320
riddle, you can take their

31:04.320 --> 31:06.320
hands and look at them and say,

31:06.320 --> 31:08.320
thank you.

31:08.320 --> 31:10.320
And then you transform into a wind

31:10.320 --> 31:12.320
serpent and you

31:12.320 --> 31:14.320
fly out of the salon.

31:14.320 --> 31:16.320
And you never go back there. But then you're

31:16.320 --> 31:18.320
back a month later. With 50 more

31:18.320 --> 31:20.320
hot new riddles. And you also

31:20.320 --> 31:22.320
bring their ant back from the dead.

31:22.320 --> 31:24.320
Yes. But only if they get the

31:24.320 --> 31:26.320
riddles right. Don't get

31:26.320 --> 31:28.320
the dead ant back if you get

31:28.320 --> 31:30.320
49 of them. You know what I mean?

31:30.320 --> 31:32.320
Ant stays dead. For each

31:32.320 --> 31:34.320
one you'll miss, another

31:34.320 --> 31:36.320
ant's gonna go.

31:36.320 --> 31:38.320
Because that's the wind serpent's curse.

31:38.320 --> 31:40.320
And you should have known that before you agreed to take

31:40.320 --> 31:42.320
me on as a client at this

31:42.320 --> 31:44.320
Super Cuts.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.320
You work at Super Cuts?

31:46.320 --> 31:48.320
You should. That's day

31:48.320 --> 31:50.320
one in the orientation. You work at Super

31:50.320 --> 31:52.320
Cuts, you're gonna lose a few ants

31:52.320 --> 31:54.320
to some cursed wind serpents. That's just

31:54.320 --> 31:56.320
in the manual, man. That's what they always

31:56.320 --> 31:58.320
say. You can't work at Super Cuts without

31:58.320 --> 32:00.320
losing a few ants to a wind serpent.

32:00.320 --> 32:02.320
Listen. And it's terrible curse.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.320
Unless we wanna get a second

32:04.320 --> 32:06.320
job at Super Cuts, we're gonna need to head to the

32:06.320 --> 32:08.320
money zone. Okay.

32:08.320 --> 32:10.320
Cause we won't be making a podcast

32:10.320 --> 32:22.320
in like a week.

32:22.320 --> 32:24.320
Hasbro. They've got a new hybrid

32:24.320 --> 32:26.320
mattress. It combines the pressure relief

32:26.320 --> 32:28.320
of their award-winning foam with

32:28.320 --> 32:30.320
the durable yet gentle springs.

32:30.320 --> 32:32.320
Oh boy. When you lay on this

32:32.320 --> 32:34.320
it's like you're sleeping on a giant's palm

32:34.320 --> 32:36.320
and that giant has moisturized

32:36.320 --> 32:38.320
consistently but not too much.

32:38.320 --> 32:40.320
Right? You know

32:40.320 --> 32:42.320
that's a perfect metaphor or simile or whatever.

32:42.320 --> 32:44.320
Yeah, not a wet giant. Not a wet giant.

32:44.320 --> 32:46.320
Not a wet giant. Just a perfectly

32:46.320 --> 32:48.320
balanced, moisturized giant.

32:48.320 --> 32:50.320
And this new innovation

32:50.320 --> 32:52.320
offers the best of both worlds.

32:52.320 --> 32:54.320
Luxurious comfort and resilient

32:54.320 --> 32:56.320
support just like a moisturized giant.

32:56.320 --> 32:58.320
And even with springs, these

32:58.320 --> 33:00.320
mattresses still come magically in a box

33:00.320 --> 33:02.320
that simply arrives on your doorstep just like

33:02.320 --> 33:04.320
a giant's hand. And you can be sure

33:04.320 --> 33:06.320
of your purchase with Kasseri's 100 night

33:06.320 --> 33:08.320
risk-free sleep on a trial

33:08.320 --> 33:10.320
just like a giant's hand. So basically

33:10.320 --> 33:12.320
these mattresses are

33:12.320 --> 33:14.320
as much like a giant's hand in the real

33:14.320 --> 33:16.320
world as you will find anywhere.

33:16.320 --> 33:18.320

33:36.320 --> 33:38.320
These things are like very, very, very

33:38.320 --> 33:40.320
small, sticky hands.

33:40.320 --> 33:42.320
When you put them on a letter, it lets

33:42.320 --> 33:44.320
the post office know that this letter's

33:44.320 --> 33:46.320
good to go, baby, and they will take it

33:46.320 --> 33:48.320
where you need it to go. But only if you use the

33:48.320 --> 33:50.320
right small, sticky hand

33:50.320 --> 33:52.320
like you might find on a rat in a sewer.

33:52.320 --> 33:54.320
Okay.

33:54.320 --> 33:56.320
Every stamp that you get from stamps.com is like a

33:56.320 --> 33:58.320
rat's hand from the sewer. And you put it on

33:58.320 --> 34:00.320
your letters and it's great. Stamps.com

34:08.320 --> 34:10.320

34:10.320 --> 34:12.320
And it saves you money with discounts

34:12.320 --> 34:14.320
you can't even get at the rat hand store.

35:00.320 --> 35:02.320
that's rat hands dot biz or

35:02.320 --> 35:04.320
stamps dot com enter my brother. Probably

35:04.320 --> 35:06.320
just stamps dot com though

35:06.320 --> 35:08.320
not the other one. It was a joke

35:08.320 --> 35:10.320
and a pretty freaking one if I had to say it

35:10.320 --> 35:12.320
by myself.

35:12.320 --> 35:14.320
Welcome.

35:14.320 --> 35:16.320
Thank you. No problem. These are real

35:16.320 --> 35:18.320
podcast listeners, not actors.

35:18.320 --> 35:20.320
What do you look for in a

35:20.320 --> 35:22.320
podcast? Reliability is big

35:22.320 --> 35:24.320
for me. Power. I'd say

35:24.320 --> 35:28.320
comfort. What do you think of this?

35:28.320 --> 35:30.320
Oh.

35:30.320 --> 35:32.320
That's Jordan Jesse Go. Jordan Jesse

35:32.320 --> 35:34.320
Go? They came out of the floor?

35:34.320 --> 35:36.320
And down from the

35:36.320 --> 35:38.320
ceiling? That can't be safe.

35:38.320 --> 35:40.320
I'm upset.

35:40.320 --> 35:42.320
Can we go now? Soon.

35:42.320 --> 35:44.320
Jordan Jesse Go.

35:44.320 --> 35:46.320
A real podcast.

35:50.320 --> 35:52.320
Now he's back good.

35:52.320 --> 35:54.320
Not forgotten.

36:06.320 --> 36:08.320
More theremin like.

36:18.320 --> 36:20.320
Now there's just a bug in the studio.

36:20.320 --> 36:22.320
Yes let me get that.

36:24.320 --> 36:26.320
I want to munch. Bugs.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.320
I want to munch.

36:30.320 --> 36:32.320
Squad.

36:36.320 --> 36:38.320
First off, it was dead to me on

36:38.320 --> 36:40.320
Netflix.

36:44.320 --> 36:46.320
Cool.

36:46.320 --> 36:50.320
Cool. I'll just say cool back.

36:50.320 --> 36:52.320
Oh, okay.

36:52.320 --> 36:54.320
I don't

36:54.320 --> 36:56.320
know. Okay, so

36:56.320 --> 36:58.320
this is a weird situation

36:58.320 --> 37:00.320
where

37:00.320 --> 37:02.320
I heard about this

37:02.320 --> 37:04.320
when it was first making the rounds

37:04.320 --> 37:06.320
and

37:06.320 --> 37:08.320
I, it was

37:08.320 --> 37:10.320
like such a munch squad that

37:10.320 --> 37:12.320
I had somehow assumed

37:12.320 --> 37:14.320
that it had, like I had

37:14.320 --> 37:16.320
already done it. Like once I'd heard about it

37:16.320 --> 37:18.320
it just seemed like oh, certainly I've

37:18.320 --> 37:20.320
already done this.

37:20.320 --> 37:22.320
Certainly I've already done this.

37:22.320 --> 37:24.320
But

37:24.320 --> 37:26.320
I haven't.

37:26.320 --> 37:28.320
And so it's Garfield Eats.

37:28.320 --> 37:30.320
Is this

37:30.320 --> 37:32.320
the concept of

37:32.320 --> 37:34.320
the orange cat we all love?

37:34.320 --> 37:36.320
The orange cat is in it.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.320
And it's just the concept

37:38.320 --> 37:40.320
that he does consume food for

37:40.320 --> 37:42.320
calories and power?

37:42.320 --> 37:44.320
Yes, he's

37:44.320 --> 37:46.320
in it. He's in this

37:46.320 --> 37:48.320
one, okay? And it's Garfield Eats.

37:48.320 --> 37:50.320
Introducing, it

37:50.320 --> 37:52.320
says here in the subject line, the

37:52.320 --> 37:54.320
world's first Garfield

37:54.320 --> 37:56.320
mobile app restaurant.

37:56.320 --> 37:58.320
Wait, what is Love Me

37:58.320 --> 38:00.320
Feed Me at Garfield Eats?

38:00.320 --> 38:02.320
It's the world's first

38:02.320 --> 38:04.320
Garfield mobile app

38:04.320 --> 38:06.320
restaurant. So that means that when they

38:06.320 --> 38:08.320
decided to do it

38:08.320 --> 38:10.320
they had to see, has

38:10.320 --> 38:12.320
anybody else done a Garfield mobile

38:12.320 --> 38:14.320
app restaurant? I can't believe

38:14.320 --> 38:16.320
they beat the rush. And the answer is no.

38:16.320 --> 38:18.320
I know. They were the first ones to

38:18.320 --> 38:20.320
pioneer this at Garfield Eats.

38:20.320 --> 38:22.320
Did you say Love Me Feed Me?

38:22.320 --> 38:24.320
Love Me

38:24.320 --> 38:26.320
Feed Me at Garfield Eats. Does it say

38:26.320 --> 38:28.320
that? It's the subject

38:28.320 --> 38:30.320
of the, it's the headline

38:30.320 --> 38:32.320
of the press release. The headline of the press release

38:32.320 --> 38:34.320
says,

38:34.320 --> 38:36.320
like Frankenstein would say,

38:36.320 --> 38:38.320
Love Me Feed Me

38:38.320 --> 38:40.320
Frankenstein Eats? Or like

38:40.320 --> 38:42.320
Audrey 2 from Little

38:42.320 --> 38:44.320
Shop of Horrors might say. Another option.

38:44.320 --> 38:46.320
You all are

38:46.320 --> 38:48.320
getting, it's not that you

38:48.320 --> 38:50.320
can't see the forest for the trees, there's like

38:50.320 --> 38:52.320
a big sign outside that's like

38:52.320 --> 38:54.320
trees ahead and you stopped there.

38:54.320 --> 38:56.320
Like you need to come with me, okay?

38:56.320 --> 38:58.320
Garfield is, this is how this

38:58.320 --> 39:00.320
press release fucking starts, okay?

39:00.320 --> 39:02.320
Garfield is the most read comic strip

39:02.320 --> 39:04.320
in the world. You know that Garfield

39:04.320 --> 39:06.320
Eats. Holy

39:06.320 --> 39:08.320
shit. I do know that. That's the

39:08.320 --> 39:10.320
first. Garfield is the most

39:10.320 --> 39:12.320
read comic strip in the world. M

39:12.320 --> 39:14.320
dash. You know that Garfield

39:14.320 --> 39:16.320
Eats. I remember that about him. A lot.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.320
A lot. Oh.

39:18.320 --> 39:20.320
That's a whole sentence. A lot.

39:20.320 --> 39:22.320
The fabulous funny that

39:22.320 --> 39:24.320
inspired. The what?

39:24.320 --> 39:26.320
Certainly they meant to say feline.

39:26.320 --> 39:28.320
Certainly they meant to say feline, but they don't.

39:28.320 --> 39:30.320
They say the fabulous funny

39:30.320 --> 39:32.320
that inspired books,

39:32.320 --> 39:34.320
movies, and TV

39:34.320 --> 39:36.320
shows. Feed the fabulous

39:36.320 --> 39:38.320
funny. Love him.

39:38.320 --> 39:40.320
The fabulous funny is about

39:40.320 --> 39:42.320
to mark its 40th

39:42.320 --> 39:44.320
year. This is like how John refers

39:44.320 --> 39:46.320
to Garfield if they were like old Victorian

39:46.320 --> 39:48.320
lovers. Oh my fabulous

39:48.320 --> 39:50.320
fun. It's about to mark

39:50.320 --> 39:52.320
his 40th year on the comics

39:52.320 --> 39:54.320
pages. So it's apropos

39:54.320 --> 39:56.320
that Garfield Eats

39:56.320 --> 39:58.320
a new innovative mobile

39:58.320 --> 40:00.320
app for entertainment and ordering

40:00.320 --> 40:02.320
food will make its debut

40:02.320 --> 40:04.320
in the world. What the fuck

40:04.320 --> 40:06.320
do you think apropos means?

40:06.320 --> 40:08.320
What do you think apropos means?

40:08.320 --> 40:10.320
That 40 years of Garfield

40:10.320 --> 40:12.320
being on comic pages

40:12.320 --> 40:14.320
is apropos to do a whole restaurant

40:14.320 --> 40:16.320
about it. Garfield

40:16.320 --> 40:18.320
Eats is a new food experience brought to

40:18.320 --> 40:20.320
you by the world's first

40:20.320 --> 40:22.320
intergaging app.

40:22.320 --> 40:24.320
What? What? What? Stop. You're the

40:24.320 --> 40:26.320
Garfield restaurant. You don't get to make up

40:26.320 --> 40:28.320
that word. That also once

40:28.320 --> 40:30.320
again sounds like some of the most steampunk

40:30.320 --> 40:32.320
shit I've ever heard.

40:32.320 --> 40:34.320
It is gonna fucking. We must

40:34.320 --> 40:36.320
apply force to the intergage if we want

40:36.320 --> 40:38.320
to power our steam zeppelin.

40:38.320 --> 40:40.320
I don't want to do anything else other than this press

40:40.320 --> 40:42.320
release. This is the first sentence

40:42.320 --> 40:44.320
of the second paragraph

40:44.320 --> 40:46.320
of this six paragraph long press release.

40:46.320 --> 40:48.320
It's the world's first intergaging

40:48.320 --> 40:50.320
app and it is

40:50.320 --> 40:52.320
an entertaining and

40:52.320 --> 40:54.320
engaging app.

40:54.320 --> 40:56.320
Fuck. It's a

40:56.320 --> 40:58.320
it's entertaining

40:58.320 --> 41:00.320
and engaging. It's

41:00.320 --> 41:02.320
both entertaining. This is entertaining

41:02.320 --> 41:04.320
me but not engaging me.

41:04.320 --> 41:06.320
It's an entertaining

41:06.320 --> 41:08.320
and engaging app that replaces

41:08.320 --> 41:10.320
the quick service restaurant with

41:10.320 --> 41:12.320
the quick mobile restaurant.

41:12.320 --> 41:14.320
OK. Not a QSR.

41:14.320 --> 41:16.320
A QMR. The app

41:16.320 --> 41:18.320
immerses the user in

41:18.320 --> 41:20.320
a complete

41:20.320 --> 41:22.320
Garfield experience.

41:22.320 --> 41:24.320
Holy. Wait.

41:24.320 --> 41:26.320
How much longer do we have in this episode

41:26.320 --> 41:28.320
because I'm starting to feel like this may be

41:28.320 --> 41:30.320
it. Now Justin

41:30.320 --> 41:32.320
before you continue on with any details

41:32.320 --> 41:34.320
they're just kind of. Oh I'd love to take a break Jeff.

41:34.320 --> 41:36.320
Hold on let me pull over the car.

41:36.320 --> 41:38.320
They're just throwing out that word complete

41:38.320 --> 41:40.320
with a lot of bravado huh.

41:40.320 --> 41:42.320
Because to me a complete

41:42.320 --> 41:44.320
Garfield experience does involve like

41:44.320 --> 41:46.320
a costume and maybe a

41:46.320 --> 41:48.320
giant house that makes me feel like the

41:48.320 --> 41:50.320
perspective of a tiny kitty. Maybe

41:50.320 --> 41:52.320
even a box of dirt I'm supposed to

41:52.320 --> 41:54.320
shit in. Yeah. Unless I can

41:54.320 --> 41:56.320
experience this app through the Oculus Rift.

41:56.320 --> 41:58.320
I don't think this is a complete

41:58.320 --> 42:00.320
Garfield experience. I'd love

42:00.320 --> 42:02.320
that to be true but I don't think that

42:02.320 --> 42:04.320
that's accurate. It's a quick

42:04.320 --> 42:06.320
mobile restaurant. The app immerses

42:06.320 --> 42:08.320
the user in a

42:08.320 --> 42:10.320
complete Garfield

42:10.320 --> 42:12.320
experience offering

42:12.320 --> 42:14.320
cartoons and

42:14.320 --> 42:16.320
augmented reality. Holy

42:16.320 --> 42:18.320
shit. Whoa.

42:18.320 --> 42:20.320
Whoa.

42:20.320 --> 42:22.320
Cartoons

42:22.320 --> 42:24.320
and augmented reality

42:24.320 --> 42:26.320
and food.

42:28.320 --> 42:30.320
Cause it's a restaurant.

42:30.320 --> 42:32.320
It is one. Remember

42:32.320 --> 42:34.320
how it's a restaurant. Yeah.

42:34.320 --> 42:36.320
Cause it still is

42:36.320 --> 42:38.320
and it's got that too cause it's

42:38.320 --> 42:40.320
intergaging. Yeah. Garfield eats

42:40.320 --> 42:42.320
by the way is stylized. No space

42:42.320 --> 42:44.320
eats is all caps.

42:44.320 --> 42:46.320
So that's powerful. Fucking cool.

42:46.320 --> 42:48.320
It's very fucking

42:48.320 --> 42:50.320
cool. It's like a it's a very

42:50.320 --> 42:52.320
punk rock of spelling Garfield eats.

42:52.320 --> 42:54.320
So

42:54.320 --> 42:56.320
on the menu

42:56.320 --> 42:58.320
delicious

42:58.320 --> 43:00.320
healthy farm

43:00.320 --> 43:02.320
two plates and

43:02.320 --> 43:04.320
here they have in parentheses F2P.

43:04.320 --> 43:06.320
This is a free to play

43:06.320 --> 43:08.320
AR Garfield

43:08.320 --> 43:10.320
experience.

43:10.320 --> 43:12.320
You can fucking have this

43:12.320 --> 43:14.320
fucking fresh kale that just came

43:14.320 --> 43:16.320
from a half mile away while you put on

43:16.320 --> 43:18.320
your Google Glass and

43:18.320 --> 43:20.320
have Odie's big powerful

43:20.320 --> 43:22.320
feet step on and crush you baby.

43:22.320 --> 43:24.320
Now

43:24.320 --> 43:26.320
we should warn you there are microtransactions.

43:26.320 --> 43:28.320
Let me finish the clause.

43:28.320 --> 43:30.320
On the menu

43:30.320 --> 43:32.320
delicious healthy

43:32.320 --> 43:34.320
farm to plate lasagna

43:34.320 --> 43:36.320
of course and

43:36.320 --> 43:38.320
pizza shaped like

43:38.320 --> 43:40.320
Garfield and baked

43:40.320 --> 43:42.320
in a wood fire oven.

43:44.320 --> 43:46.320
Ordered through the

43:46.320 --> 43:48.320
app and delivered quickly to anyone

43:48.320 --> 43:50.320
in Dubai.

43:50.320 --> 43:52.320
Justin you just

43:52.320 --> 43:54.320
I have never been so quickly deflated.

43:54.320 --> 43:56.320
I know

43:56.320 --> 43:58.320
I know.

43:58.320 --> 44:00.320
I can't fucking believe you.

44:00.320 --> 44:02.320
What you just did

44:02.320 --> 44:04.320
what you just did was treasonous.

44:04.320 --> 44:06.320
It was treason.

44:06.320 --> 44:08.320
Ordered through the app and is delivered quickly

44:08.320 --> 44:10.320
to anyone in Dubai. Also

44:10.320 --> 44:12.320
this is a sentence.

44:12.320 --> 44:14.320
Also because

44:14.320 --> 44:16.320
Garfield loves his coffee.

44:16.320 --> 44:18.320
Enter the Garfuccino.

44:18.320 --> 44:20.320
Made with 100 percent

44:20.320 --> 44:22.320
Arabica

44:22.320 --> 44:24.320
coffee from Italy.

44:24.320 --> 44:26.320
It's an international

44:26.320 --> 44:28.320
affair.

44:28.320 --> 44:30.320
The word Garfuccino

44:30.320 --> 44:32.320
is the grossest thing

44:32.320 --> 44:34.320
I've ever heard. Like if you

44:34.320 --> 44:36.320
told me that was a euphemism for

44:36.320 --> 44:38.320
vomit I would be like oh man

44:38.320 --> 44:40.320
I gotta go Garf.

44:40.320 --> 44:42.320
I'm gonna Garfuccino all over this place.

44:42.320 --> 44:44.320
I've got a running list

44:44.320 --> 44:46.320
of substances I would

44:46.320 --> 44:48.320
least like to drown in.

44:48.320 --> 44:50.320
And Garfuccino has just

44:50.320 --> 44:52.320
rocketed up the list.

44:52.320 --> 44:54.320
Especially when you consider that

44:54.320 --> 44:56.320
one of my favorite like

44:56.320 --> 44:58.320
abomination words duncuccino

44:58.320 --> 45:00.320
is such a great word

45:00.320 --> 45:02.320
that I love saying.

45:02.320 --> 45:04.320
Yeah they were so close. Garfield eats

45:04.320 --> 45:06.320
co-founders. Oh no!

45:06.320 --> 45:08.320
Are they okay? Oh man!

45:08.320 --> 45:10.320
That's too bad. Sorry

45:10.320 --> 45:12.320
Garfield eats co-founders Nathan

45:12.320 --> 45:14.320
Mosery and Pascal Heider

45:14.320 --> 45:16.320
were born well after Garfield's

45:16.320 --> 45:18.320
rise to fame but both

45:18.320 --> 45:20.320
were fans of the cartoon growing up.

45:20.320 --> 45:22.320
What the fuck could that possibly

45:22.320 --> 45:24.320
matter?

45:24.320 --> 45:26.320
So they're legit. These aren't your

45:26.320 --> 45:28.320
bandwagon Garfield. No they know

45:28.320 --> 45:30.320
they're gonna get the brand right. Knowing

45:30.320 --> 45:32.320
Garfield's penchant for Italian food

45:32.320 --> 45:34.320
they thought Garfield would be the perfect pitchman

45:34.320 --> 45:36.320
for their brand of scooter pizza

45:36.320 --> 45:38.320
I guess. I don't know

45:38.320 --> 45:40.320
that he's a fan of Italian. We never see like

45:40.320 --> 45:42.320
we never see scenes

45:42.320 --> 45:44.320
of him like at a fancy restaurant

45:44.320 --> 45:46.320
enjoying like

45:46.320 --> 45:48.320
bolognese or something

45:48.320 --> 45:50.320
like he's. You're gonna lose this

45:50.320 --> 45:52.320
because his favorite food is lasagna.

45:52.320 --> 45:54.320
No I know that but his favorite food is lasagna.

45:54.320 --> 45:56.320
That doesn't mean like

45:56.320 --> 45:58.320
he's a fan of Italian. It just means he really likes

45:58.320 --> 46:00.320
lasagna. Yeah.

46:00.320 --> 46:02.320
Their vision is to make the ordering

46:02.320 --> 46:04.320
of food fun and easy

46:04.320 --> 46:06.320
utilizing modern technology.

46:06.320 --> 46:08.320
You can use voice recognition

46:08.320 --> 46:10.320
to order.

46:10.320 --> 46:12.320
Here's the thing. How

46:12.320 --> 46:14.320
frequently do you have to

46:14.320 --> 46:16.320
order from the Garfield Eats app

46:16.320 --> 46:18.320
before you're like I don't have the time

46:18.320 --> 46:20.320
to type this every time I want

46:20.320 --> 46:22.320
lasagna. I'm gonna need

46:22.320 --> 46:24.320
to start speaking and just rolling the dice.

46:24.320 --> 46:26.320
If I could have a button like one might get from

46:26.320 --> 46:28.320
Amazon then I would have that

46:28.320 --> 46:30.320
with just a picture of a Garfield

46:30.320 --> 46:32.320
shaped pizza on it that I can push.

46:32.320 --> 46:34.320
No I sold my phone.

46:34.320 --> 46:36.320
I got an Amazon Dash button for Garfield

46:36.320 --> 46:38.320
scooter pizza. And you know what really sucks about that

46:38.320 --> 46:40.320
is when I'm watching my

46:40.320 --> 46:42.320
television stories and one of the

46:42.320 --> 46:44.320
characters on the show says boy

46:44.320 --> 46:46.320
I'd love to have a scooter deliver me a

46:46.320 --> 46:48.320
Garfield shaped pizza in Dubai

46:48.320 --> 46:50.320
which happens in most of my shows.

46:50.320 --> 46:52.320
Yeah that happens eight

46:52.320 --> 46:54.320
time in Ballers episode four.

46:54.320 --> 46:56.320
That's a false positive.

46:56.320 --> 46:58.320
That sucks and maybe I don't want a Garfield.

46:58.320 --> 47:00.320
Of course I am always gonna want a Garfield shaped

47:00.320 --> 47:02.320
pizza. That shit's hilarious.

47:02.320 --> 47:04.320
By the way if you're wondering

47:04.320 --> 47:06.320
I looked it up. Garfield shaped pizza

47:06.320 --> 47:08.320
is like the outline of

47:08.320 --> 47:10.320
his face which looks

47:10.320 --> 47:12.320
to be an impossible

47:12.320 --> 47:14.320
shape to roll a pizza

47:14.320 --> 47:16.320
out into. So every

47:16.320 --> 47:18.320
one of these motherfuckers must

47:18.320 --> 47:20.320
be like hand shaped

47:20.320 --> 47:22.320
into his face.

47:22.320 --> 47:24.320
Nice.

47:24.320 --> 47:26.320
So

47:26.320 --> 47:28.320
okay so Garfield Eats will adhere to

47:28.320 --> 47:30.320
and I'm sure this is everyone's concern

47:30.320 --> 47:32.320
adhere to strict F2P

47:32.320 --> 47:34.320
guidelines on supply

47:34.320 --> 47:36.320
sourcing guaranteeing no GMOs

47:36.320 --> 47:38.320
that doesn't matter. No preservatives

47:38.320 --> 47:40.320
no artificial colors. That's Garfield modified

47:40.320 --> 47:42.320
organisms.

47:42.320 --> 47:44.320
Yeah

47:44.320 --> 47:46.320
he hasn't fucking licked anything.

47:46.320 --> 47:48.320
No artificial

47:48.320 --> 47:50.320
colors and no fertilizers.

47:50.320 --> 47:52.320
I mean I should hope not.

47:52.320 --> 47:54.320
That would be a weird topping as these

47:54.320 --> 47:56.320
things go.

47:56.320 --> 47:58.320
They'll also use rechargeable

47:58.320 --> 48:00.320
electric scooters to deliver

48:00.320 --> 48:02.320
the food in rebox packaging that

48:02.320 --> 48:04.320
can be repurposed. Okay.

48:04.320 --> 48:06.320
Anything can be repurposed. What's the Venn diagram

48:06.320 --> 48:08.320
of people out there

48:08.320 --> 48:10.320
who are so excited about

48:10.320 --> 48:12.320
like is there is that

48:12.320 --> 48:14.320
how big is the overlap between like

48:14.320 --> 48:16.320
yes listen of course of course

48:16.320 --> 48:18.320
I want to eat a Garfield

48:18.320 --> 48:20.320
shaped pizza or maybe even Garfield

48:20.320 --> 48:22.320
shaped lasagna I'm not sure

48:22.320 --> 48:24.320
but only if

48:24.320 --> 48:26.320
it is sustainably

48:26.320 --> 48:28.320
sourced and eco friendly.

48:28.320 --> 48:30.320
Farm to table.

48:30.320 --> 48:32.320
F2P.

48:32.320 --> 48:34.320
Free to play no loot boxes no

48:34.320 --> 48:36.320
pay to win.

48:36.320 --> 48:38.320
Here's something that's just a whole

48:38.320 --> 48:40.320
you guys

48:40.320 --> 48:42.320
know what a nut graph is? Sure.

48:42.320 --> 48:44.320
Griffin you probably know that from journalism.

48:44.320 --> 48:46.320
It's the paragraph in a press release

48:46.320 --> 48:48.320
that's so good that you can't

48:48.320 --> 48:50.320
not have a cum.

48:50.320 --> 48:52.320
Nut graph is the

48:52.320 --> 48:54.320
thing that you like if you're a reporter you like

48:54.320 --> 48:56.320
Dave it's like anytime you need to talk about

48:56.320 --> 48:58.320
this thing like you can

48:58.320 --> 49:00.320
put this in right there.

49:00.320 --> 49:02.320
So the nut graph

49:02.320 --> 49:04.320
for Garfield and this is a paragraph

49:04.320 --> 49:06.320
I'm assuming is in everything Garfield related

49:06.320 --> 49:08.320
from here to eternity.

49:08.320 --> 49:10.320
Nearly 40 years ago

49:10.320 --> 49:12.320
on June 19th 1978

49:12.320 --> 49:14.320
Garfield was born on the

49:14.320 --> 49:16.320
comics pages. The master

49:16.320 --> 49:18.320
mind of cartoonist Jim Davis

49:18.320 --> 49:20.320
that's not what that means.

49:20.320 --> 49:22.320
Garfield is a humorous strip. Or wait let's

49:22.320 --> 49:24.320
change the possibility.

49:24.320 --> 49:26.320
Wait Jim Davis not exist?

49:26.320 --> 49:28.320
Jim Davis was the fictional

49:28.320 --> 49:30.320
creation of the orange lasagna cat Garfield.

49:30.320 --> 49:32.320
Whoa. Garfield is

49:32.320 --> 49:34.320
a humorous strip and you know what

49:34.320 --> 49:36.320
humorous is just about right

49:36.320 --> 49:38.320
huh? That really gets it doesn't say

49:38.320 --> 49:40.320
riotous or funny.

49:40.320 --> 49:42.320
It says it's humorous. It's definitely

49:42.320 --> 49:44.320
not sad most of the

49:44.320 --> 49:46.320
time. It's this unsad

49:46.320 --> 49:48.320
strip except sometimes

49:48.320 --> 49:50.320
it's very sad though I will say that.

49:50.320 --> 49:52.320
It is very sad.

49:52.320 --> 49:54.320
Garfield is a humorous strip centered on

49:54.320 --> 49:56.320
the lives of a lazy

49:56.320 --> 49:58.320
cynical orange cat who loves

49:58.320 --> 50:00.320
lasagna, pizza, coffee

50:00.320 --> 50:02.320
and his remote control. His owner

50:02.320 --> 50:04.320
the long suffering John Arbuckle

50:04.320 --> 50:06.320
and Odie a sweet but dumb

50:06.320 --> 50:08.320
dog. So

50:08.320 --> 50:10.320
can you give me

50:10.320 --> 50:12.320
here's the thing Travis here's the thing

50:12.320 --> 50:14.320
this is five paragraphs in.

50:14.320 --> 50:16.320
I'm excited about this

50:16.320 --> 50:18.320
idea I cannot wait to find out who

50:18.320 --> 50:20.320
this Garfield character is.

50:20.320 --> 50:22.320
Who the fuck is Garfield?

50:22.320 --> 50:24.320
This is so good I love all of it

50:24.320 --> 50:26.320
F2P lasagna for sure.

50:26.320 --> 50:28.320
Who the fuck is Garfield?

50:28.320 --> 50:30.320
I cannot wait to find out about this lasagna cat.

50:30.320 --> 50:32.320
I'm on pins and needles

50:32.320 --> 50:34.320
about who Garfield is.

50:34.320 --> 50:36.320
That's the one thing

50:36.320 --> 50:38.320
my checkbook is out. I'm loving

50:38.320 --> 50:40.320
it but who's Garfield?

50:44.320 --> 50:46.320
It actually ends on an even higher note.

50:46.320 --> 50:48.320
Garfield's creator Jim Davis

50:48.320 --> 50:50.320
said he was delighted with the concept

50:50.320 --> 50:52.320
here's a quote. In forty years

50:52.320 --> 50:54.320
no one has ever come to me with a better

50:54.320 --> 50:56.320
thought out plan to deliver great food

50:56.320 --> 50:58.320
in a fun and engaging way. Holy shit

50:58.320 --> 51:00.320
Really?

51:02.320 --> 51:04.320
So Jim Davis

51:04.320 --> 51:06.320
in Jim Davis's life one component

51:06.320 --> 51:08.320
of it is people frequently

51:08.320 --> 51:10.320
come to him with plans to deliver

51:10.320 --> 51:12.320
great food in a fun and engaging way.

51:12.320 --> 51:14.320
No no no none of you. He can't even

51:14.320 --> 51:16.320
look at his Twitter DMs anymore.

51:16.320 --> 51:18.320
It's just fucking. So here's the thing Jim

51:18.320 --> 51:20.320
it's called the Gar Ferrari. No.

51:20.320 --> 51:22.320
It's Garfield shaped Ferrari and you bring

51:22.320 --> 51:24.320
it and kids love it. Listen when I created

51:24.320 --> 51:26.320
Garfield like a half

51:26.320 --> 51:28.320
a century ago I did so

51:28.320 --> 51:30.320
with the dream of one day

51:30.320 --> 51:32.320
turning it into an F2P

51:32.320 --> 51:34.320
home delivery food

51:34.320 --> 51:36.320
intergaging experience

51:36.320 --> 51:38.320
and you have not found it yet sir.

51:38.320 --> 51:40.320
So you take this garbage

51:40.320 --> 51:42.320
and you bury it in a box of dirt where it belongs.

51:42.320 --> 51:44.320
So you can go to GarfieldEats.com

51:44.320 --> 51:46.320
and

51:46.320 --> 51:48.320
find out more

51:48.320 --> 51:50.320
about that. I'm very disappointed

51:50.320 --> 51:52.320
because I wanted to get the Garfield Eats

51:52.320 --> 51:54.320
app on my phone. I think it's only in the UAE

51:54.320 --> 51:56.320
but if you search Garfield on the

51:56.320 --> 51:58.320
app store here's what you get. Garfield Rush

51:58.320 --> 52:00.320
Garfield My

52:00.320 --> 52:02.320
Big Fat Diet. My Talking

52:02.320 --> 52:04.320
Garfield. Garfield

52:04.320 --> 52:06.320
Survival of the Fattest.

52:06.320 --> 52:08.320
Garfield Snack Time

52:08.320 --> 52:10.320
Garfield Go. Garfield Food

52:10.320 --> 52:12.320
Truck. Garfield Daily.

52:12.320 --> 52:14.320
Garfield Walk.

52:14.320 --> 52:16.320
This is all the Garfield apps that

52:16.320 --> 52:18.320
there are. So there's a lot of that. Wowzy

52:18.320 --> 52:20.320
bowzies my boy. This website

52:20.320 --> 52:22.320
GarfieldEats.com is a

52:22.320 --> 52:24.320
good one of the websites.

52:24.320 --> 52:26.320
This website Justin. This website

52:26.320 --> 52:28.320
it's a good website. In

52:28.320 --> 52:30.320
this website you've seen lots of websites

52:30.320 --> 52:32.320
folks because the internet's been around for a bit.

52:32.320 --> 52:34.320
In this website they do have a picture

52:34.320 --> 52:36.320
and it's half just Garfield's

52:36.320 --> 52:38.320
face but then the other half

52:38.320 --> 52:40.320
is what looks like an asparagus

52:40.320 --> 52:42.320
and broccoli pizza. So it's almost

52:42.320 --> 52:44.320
like he is a I'm gonna say Pizzamorf

52:44.320 --> 52:46.320
which is a new series from Scholastic

52:46.320 --> 52:48.320
that I'm very excited about in which famous

52:48.320 --> 52:50.320
cartoon cats do turn into pizza.

52:50.320 --> 52:52.320
This website is so fucking good Justin

52:52.320 --> 52:54.320
I'm losing my mind.

52:54.320 --> 52:56.320
I think very

52:56.320 --> 52:58.320
we've been looking we've talked behind the scenes

52:58.320 --> 53:00.320
a lot about trying to find that perfect

53:00.320 --> 53:02.320
excuse to do a Dubai live show

53:02.320 --> 53:04.320
and maybe this is it.

53:04.320 --> 53:06.320
Maybe this is maybe

53:06.320 --> 53:08.320
it's not we don't

53:08.320 --> 53:10.320
go to the live show and happen to eat some Garfield

53:10.320 --> 53:12.320
shaped pizza. We go eat

53:12.320 --> 53:14.320
some Garfield shaped pizza and happen to do

53:14.320 --> 53:16.320
a Dubai live show. There is

53:16.320 --> 53:18.320
on the website

53:18.320 --> 53:20.320
because they did it in

53:20.320 --> 53:22.320
Canada too. It is in Canada so it is

53:22.320 --> 53:24.320
Well we're never going to Canada. Let's admit

53:24.320 --> 53:26.320
that. Canada?

53:26.320 --> 53:28.320
What's that? There's a video

53:28.320 --> 53:30.320
on

53:30.320 --> 53:32.320
the website that has 371

53:32.320 --> 53:34.320
views. It was released

53:34.320 --> 53:36.320
May 2nd so this is off the presses.

53:36.320 --> 53:38.320
It is on the Garfield Eats website

53:38.320 --> 53:40.320
and is a 3 minute and

53:40.320 --> 53:42.320
44 second long video

53:42.320 --> 53:44.320
of Jim Davis talking

53:44.320 --> 53:46.320
about Garfield eating while

53:46.320 --> 53:48.320
he holds the stuffed Garfield and

53:48.320 --> 53:50.320
cartoons of Garfield.

53:50.320 --> 53:52.320
That's a video that you can go see at

53:52.320 --> 53:54.320
GarfieldEats.com if you want to scoop that up.

53:54.320 --> 53:56.320
Griffin if you want to

53:56.320 --> 53:58.320
edit in like 10 seconds of the

53:58.320 --> 54:00.320
audio from that I think we'd be cleared to it

54:00.320 --> 54:02.320
just to like get a little bit

54:02.320 --> 54:04.320
of that heat. Okay don't tell Jim.

54:04.320 --> 54:06.320
Garfield Eats.

54:06.320 --> 54:08.320
I think that's been pretty well established.

54:08.320 --> 54:10.320
His lifelong love affair with pasta

54:10.320 --> 54:12.320
and pizza is legendary.

54:12.320 --> 54:14.320
In fact if Garfield could dream

54:14.320 --> 54:16.320
up the perfect restaurant it

54:16.320 --> 54:18.320
would feature lasagna and pizza.

54:18.320 --> 54:20.320
Well Garfield's dream has come

54:20.320 --> 54:22.320
true and it's in the form of

54:22.320 --> 54:24.320
a new innovative concept

54:24.320 --> 54:26.320
restaurant.

54:26.320 --> 54:32.320
Garfield Eats.

54:32.320 --> 54:34.320
Take care of the cat

54:34.320 --> 54:36.320
and the cat will take care of you.

54:36.320 --> 54:38.320
And I'm on the website now there is a little

54:38.320 --> 54:40.320
chat box where you do want to talk to customer service

54:40.320 --> 54:42.320
so I did ping them hoping to ask like are you

54:42.320 --> 54:44.320
planning to spread to the states anytime soon.

54:44.320 --> 54:46.320
So I said hello and then the bot responded

54:46.320 --> 54:48.320
oh it's you. Thanks for chatting us up.

54:48.320 --> 54:50.320
One of our friends will be

54:54.320 --> 54:56.320

54:56.320 --> 54:58.320
Hard pass. I panicked I said my name is Derek

54:58.320 --> 55:00.320
and then customer service

55:00.320 --> 55:02.320
immediately responded

55:02.320 --> 55:04.320
we are experiencing large volumes

55:04.320 --> 55:06.320
of chat messages.

55:06.320 --> 55:08.320
I'm sure yeah. Please leave your mobile number

goopons

55:26.320 --> 55:28.320
and Garfield exclusive series.

55:28.320 --> 55:30.320
I don't think you meant to do that.

55:30.320 --> 55:32.320
I don't think you meant to do that.

55:32.320 --> 55:34.320
Guys I don't think this is groupons

55:34.320 --> 55:36.320
misspelled because why would they give out

55:36.320 --> 55:38.320
groupons. I think this is

55:38.320 --> 55:40.320
Garfield coupons

55:40.320 --> 55:42.320
is an experience that they

55:42.320 --> 55:44.320
have a currency that they have titled

55:44.320 --> 55:46.320
goopons.

55:48.320 --> 55:50.320
There is a fucking. OK

55:50.320 --> 55:52.320
guys this is going to sound like a joke

55:52.320 --> 55:54.320
but it's not a joke. So this

55:54.320 --> 55:56.320
Reeboks thing you can and

55:56.320 --> 55:58.320
it's not Reeboks how it sounds

55:58.320 --> 56:00.320
in your brain when I say the words

56:00.320 --> 56:02.320
it's R E hyphen B O

56:02.320 --> 56:04.320
X right Reeboks is a thing

56:04.320 --> 56:06.320
where you can reuse

56:06.320 --> 56:08.320
the packaging

56:08.320 --> 56:10.320
that your food comes in and

56:10.320 --> 56:12.320
they have videos for how to do it

56:12.320 --> 56:14.320
on

56:14.320 --> 56:16.320
the website and there's a video

56:16.320 --> 56:18.320
that is 20 seconds long that

56:18.320 --> 56:20.320
says how to transform your

56:20.320 --> 56:22.320
Garfield cup your Garfield

56:22.320 --> 56:24.320
eats cup into a pencil holder.

56:24.320 --> 56:26.320
Wow. And here are the instructions

56:26.320 --> 56:28.320
the instructions are this number one

56:28.320 --> 56:30.320
uses a pencil holder

56:30.320 --> 56:32.320
that boy

56:32.320 --> 56:34.320
that's it. Oh boy.

56:34.320 --> 56:36.320
You've made me very happy Garfield eats.

56:36.320 --> 56:38.320

on the flat earth

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.320
I want to take advantage of

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:44.320
humankind and make them believe a lie

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:46.320
so that they will trust us with the government it's

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:48.320
all an elaborate lie and when you get on a plane

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.320
they purposely fly you farther

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.320
than you need to go it's disgusting

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.320

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.320

we won't do that we will just tell

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:04.320
you the truth behind the truth because what we

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:06.320
do is we look at extraordinary claims

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:08.320
