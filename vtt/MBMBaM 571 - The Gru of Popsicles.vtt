00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.660 --> 00:49.660
It's better it's better

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
It's better it's better

01:00.260 --> 01:02.260
Better it's better

01:11.020 --> 01:16.740
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me and my show for the modren era

01:16.740 --> 01:21.540
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. Hello booze and ghouls and

01:22.660 --> 01:28.260
Non-boonary folk. I'm your middle this brother Travis were wolf wolf

01:28.980 --> 01:33.580
McElroy, it's ah, it's ah, it's early August

01:33.580 --> 01:45.740
No, let Griffin do his so I can ignore yours and this is Griffin and this and this is Griffin McElroy

01:45.740 --> 01:47.740
There's a chill in the air

01:47.740 --> 01:49.740
The leaves are turning

01:49.740 --> 01:51.740
I had a silly dentist thing happen

01:51.740 --> 01:53.740
From orange and brown and yellow

01:53.740 --> 01:55.740
I can't I can't

01:55.740 --> 02:01.740
There's a chill things are getting spooky

02:01.740 --> 02:05.740
We're all already unhinged for time you cannot do this

02:05.740 --> 02:15.740
I went to the home goods store to buy a picture frame and they had Halloween pillows for sale

02:15.740 --> 02:19.740
Okay, so that's it that means that's the starting gun

02:19.740 --> 02:21.740
The season has begun

02:21.740 --> 02:23.740
They had ceramic pumpkins

02:23.740 --> 02:29.740
It's it's actually gang it is July the 29th as we're required

02:29.740 --> 02:31.740
Yeah, spooky season

02:31.740 --> 02:35.740
When the ghosts come out to play

02:35.740 --> 02:41.740
The ghosts won't be out Traff for three more entire earth months

02:41.740 --> 02:43.740
The ghosts are on the beach

02:43.740 --> 02:49.740
My local home goods had Salvatore Ferragamo Uomo fragrance on clearance

02:49.740 --> 02:53.740
That don't make it fall. That's obviously an autumnal scent

02:53.740 --> 02:55.740
Right

02:55.740 --> 02:57.740
Don't make it fall

02:57.740 --> 02:59.740
It's spooky season

02:59.740 --> 03:01.740
It's absolutely not

03:01.740 --> 03:07.740
I got one brother who is who's turned into a vampire skeleton only bones

03:07.740 --> 03:13.740
And then I have and then I have another brother that's trying to backdoor Richard Stink in here in this in this Halloween

03:13.740 --> 03:15.740
No, no, here's here's what you're fucking with

03:15.740 --> 03:17.740
Yeah, this is why this is why

03:17.740 --> 03:19.740
This is what's up Travis

03:19.740 --> 03:21.740
This is why I sampled it. This is why I sampled it

03:21.740 --> 03:25.740
Richard Stink comes out four times a year at the beginning of every season

03:25.740 --> 03:31.740
And then my brother is telling me that it is the spooky season upon us

03:31.740 --> 03:33.740
Then Richard Stink comes out

03:33.740 --> 03:41.740
Now if he's gonna obey the Gregorian calendar of our ancestors, maybe you've heard of it, you know

03:41.740 --> 03:43.740
That's up to Richard to decide

03:43.740 --> 03:49.740
That same fucking calendar by the way that says that September 13th is summer

03:49.740 --> 03:51.740
It's not

03:51.740 --> 03:57.740
It's not, you joke, just like July 29th is spooky season

03:57.740 --> 04:01.740
This is lose, lose, lose, lose, lose for me

04:01.740 --> 04:07.740
Have you decided on your Halloween costumes?

04:07.740 --> 04:09.740
Um

04:09.740 --> 04:13.740
What will you be doing to celebrate Samhain?

04:13.740 --> 04:15.740
I think we've let enough of this go I need to say something

04:15.740 --> 04:19.740
Don't let a black cat cross your path

04:19.740 --> 04:23.740
Fire skeleton only bones Travis can you just hold on for a second so Justin can say a thing

04:23.740 --> 04:25.740
It's just like really important

04:25.740 --> 04:27.740
Okay

04:27.740 --> 04:35.740
I wanted to say if you all were listening to episode 566 of My Brother My Brother and Me

04:35.740 --> 04:39.740
You may have heard me talk about some new Kraft Dinner flavor boosts

04:39.740 --> 04:41.740
Oh my god

04:41.740 --> 04:53.740
And I may have said something ill-advised at the end of that episode that I didn't really think through

04:53.740 --> 04:59.740
Briefly this is what I said

04:59.740 --> 05:05.740
If you're in Canada I need you to get as much that fucking Jesus you can just ruin my box

05:05.740 --> 05:11.740
Ruin my box with KD okay? Hey ruin my box with KD

05:11.740 --> 05:13.740
Get all that weird KD and ruin my box

05:13.740 --> 05:19.740
So that's what I said and I kinda forgot I said it until this week

05:19.740 --> 05:25.740
When I went to the post office and my friendly post office people were

05:25.740 --> 05:31.740
I'll go ahead and say it not thrilled to see

05:31.740 --> 05:33.740
How flavor blasted was your box?

05:33.740 --> 05:39.740
They saw me and one of the dudes walked out of the room as soon as I walked in

05:39.740 --> 05:45.740
And I walked to the other dude and I was like box 54 please and he's like oh yeah he's going to go get it

05:45.740 --> 05:49.740
On site they know you on site

05:49.740 --> 05:53.740
They had one of those don't let this shoplifter in photos on the wall

05:53.740 --> 05:57.740
But it was like give this man his cheesy box as quick as you can

05:57.740 --> 06:01.740
Get this cheese out of here

06:01.740 --> 06:09.740
And these dudes start piling up boxes and all of them have that distinctive Canada post thing

06:09.740 --> 06:15.740
And I will admit I did have a fleeting moment where I was like whoa a lot of fan mail this week

06:15.740 --> 06:17.740
Guess the J man's back

06:17.740 --> 06:25.740
It requires a certain amount of effort to send you macaroni and cheese flavor addition mix ins

06:25.740 --> 06:31.740
That belies an amount of fandom that is staggering

06:31.740 --> 06:37.740
I also imagine Justin that there were a lot of tariffs on the postage was probably high

06:37.740 --> 06:41.740
Yeah so let's talk about that aspect of it for a second okay

06:41.740 --> 06:47.740
Canada I'm just going to talk to Canada for a second Canada

06:47.740 --> 06:49.740
Should we leave?

06:49.740 --> 06:53.740
No no you guys can be here and you can listen because I want there to be a witness

06:53.740 --> 06:55.740
Oh we're like ambassadors we have diplomatic community

06:55.740 --> 06:57.740
Exactly

06:57.740 --> 07:03.740
I asked you to send me all the weird KD and I was not specific enough I am sorry about that

07:03.740 --> 07:11.740
You all sent me approximately by my count 83 different packets of flavor boosting

07:11.740 --> 07:13.740
Are you kidding me?

07:13.740 --> 07:15.740
83 different packets of flavor boosting

07:15.740 --> 07:21.740
But Canada you sent me 109 boxes of mac and cheese

07:21.740 --> 07:25.740
Now listen it's the same mac and cheese

07:25.740 --> 07:27.740
Well well well hold on

07:27.740 --> 07:31.740
KD and mac and cheese are the same product

07:31.740 --> 07:35.740
But you don't know the consistency 100% I do

07:35.740 --> 07:37.740
How do you know?

07:37.740 --> 07:41.740
Nobody knows it but actually Travis I would say I Justin McElroy at this point in my life

07:41.740 --> 07:47.740
Am uniquely positioned to say that these are the same products

07:47.740 --> 07:53.740
But molecularly I'm saying that what you've got is Canadian cheese dust versus American cheese dust

07:53.740 --> 07:57.740
You can't tell me it's the same cheese dust at a molecular level

07:57.740 --> 08:01.740
You are an infant tickling yourself with a razor

08:01.740 --> 08:05.740
You are speaking to the world's preeminent cheese dust scholar

08:05.740 --> 08:07.740
You don't think I've had cheese dust in my life?

08:07.740 --> 08:09.740
Travis

08:09.740 --> 08:11.740
You don't think I've flavor blasted some nudes?

08:11.740 --> 08:13.740
Travis

08:13.740 --> 08:15.740
What?

08:15.740 --> 08:17.740
Travis

08:17.740 --> 08:19.740
But I also have been shipped

08:19.740 --> 08:23.740
What I'm saying is I've been shipped 109 boxes of Canadian mac and cheese

08:23.740 --> 08:25.740
And I've eaten enough

08:25.740 --> 08:27.740
It's the same

08:27.740 --> 08:29.740
Travis

08:29.740 --> 08:31.740
You've only had these for about a week Justin

08:31.740 --> 08:33.740
How much have you consumed with your human form?

08:33.740 --> 08:35.740
Travis

08:35.740 --> 08:37.740
Here's the thing though

08:37.740 --> 08:39.740
This is not going to waste

08:39.740 --> 08:49.740
We are sending around 100 boxes of Kraft Dinner to Harmony House

08:49.740 --> 08:51.740
Travis

08:51.740 --> 08:53.740
They're going to think you're an extreme couponer

08:53.740 --> 08:55.740
Travis

08:55.740 --> 08:57.740
Well the people who are experiencing homelessness currently want to flavor blast

08:57.740 --> 08:59.740
That is up to them

08:59.740 --> 09:01.740
They will get some packets no doubt

09:01.740 --> 09:03.740
So the food will not go to waste

09:03.740 --> 09:05.740
I did make a couple of these to go ahead and sample them

09:05.740 --> 09:07.740
Travis

09:07.740 --> 09:09.740
I'm curious about

09:09.740 --> 09:11.740
Travis

09:11.740 --> 09:13.740
Is it the cotton candy?

09:13.740 --> 09:15.740
Travis

09:15.740 --> 09:17.740
It is the cotton candy

09:17.740 --> 09:19.740
Travis

09:19.740 --> 09:21.740
I bet it fucks

09:21.740 --> 09:23.740
Travis

09:23.740 --> 09:25.740
We've had some different reactions

09:25.740 --> 09:27.740
Travis

09:27.740 --> 09:29.740
I bet Charlie loves it

09:29.740 --> 09:31.740
Travis

09:31.740 --> 09:33.740
I bet Sydney wanted to vomit

09:33.740 --> 09:35.740
Travis

09:35.740 --> 09:37.740
Yeah

09:37.740 --> 09:39.740
Travis

09:39.740 --> 09:41.740
Loved it?

09:41.740 --> 09:43.740
Travis

09:43.740 --> 09:45.740
Yeah, but it's great

09:45.740 --> 09:47.740
Travis

09:47.740 --> 09:49.740
It works in the same way as

09:49.740 --> 09:51.740
Travis

09:51.740 --> 09:53.740
Don't think of it as cotton candy and cheese

09:53.740 --> 09:55.740
Travis

09:55.740 --> 09:57.740
Because neither of those things are present

09:57.740 --> 09:59.740
Travis

09:59.740 --> 10:01.740
It's a new flavor in your ear

10:01.740 --> 10:03.740
Travis

10:03.740 --> 10:05.740
It's actually like Danish

10:05.740 --> 10:07.740
Travis

10:07.740 --> 10:09.740
Think of it more like

10:09.740 --> 10:11.740
Travis

10:11.740 --> 10:13.740
The flavor of

10:13.740 --> 10:15.740
Travis

10:15.740 --> 10:17.740
The flavor of Papa's beard is not very pricey

10:17.740 --> 10:19.740
Travis

10:19.740 --> 10:21.740
Yeah, they call it Papa's beard

10:21.740 --> 10:23.740
Travis

10:23.740 --> 10:25.740
That's why they call it cotton candy

10:25.740 --> 10:27.740
Travis

10:27.740 --> 10:29.740
Because it's like God's beard

10:29.740 --> 10:31.740
Travis

10:31.740 --> 10:33.740
That idea

10:33.740 --> 10:35.740
If you can wrap your brain around that idea

10:35.740 --> 10:37.740
It's sort of like that

10:37.740 --> 10:39.740
Travis

10:39.740 --> 10:41.740
Or like a cheese and apple pie that I learned about from pushing daisies

10:41.740 --> 10:43.740
Travis

10:43.740 --> 10:45.740
The only one that I know that only John Joy didn't like it

10:45.740 --> 10:47.740
Travis

10:47.740 --> 10:49.740
The fifth member of your family is where the differing opinion came in

10:49.740 --> 10:51.740
I'm sorry, I forgot about your son, John Joy

10:51.740 --> 10:53.740
Grown adult man who I believe is older than you

10:53.740 --> 10:55.740
Travis

10:55.740 --> 10:57.740
John Joy is a fellow West Virginia podcaster

10:57.740 --> 10:59.740
Host of Professor Theo's Mystery Lab

10:59.740 --> 11:01.740
Travis

11:01.740 --> 11:03.740
You're going to love these stories

11:03.740 --> 11:05.740
Travis

11:05.740 --> 11:07.740
But he's a hater of this great mac and cheese product

11:07.740 --> 11:09.740
Travis

11:09.740 --> 11:11.740
He took one bite and this is his entire reaction

11:11.740 --> 11:13.740
Travis

11:13.740 --> 11:15.740
No

11:15.740 --> 11:17.740
Travis

11:17.740 --> 11:19.740
That's his review

11:19.740 --> 11:21.740
Travis

11:21.740 --> 11:23.740
That's his review

11:23.740 --> 11:25.740
Travis

11:25.740 --> 11:27.740
He can't go into it with an open mind

11:27.740 --> 11:29.740
Travis

11:29.740 --> 11:31.740
The ghost pepper is a threat

11:31.740 --> 11:33.740
There's three other spicy

11:33.740 --> 11:35.740
And spicy with mac and cheese is pretty good

11:35.740 --> 11:37.740
Even the butter chicken had a nice amount of spice

11:37.740 --> 11:39.740
Travis

11:39.740 --> 11:41.740
That sounds good to me

11:41.740 --> 11:43.740
Travis

11:43.740 --> 11:45.740
The one that was rough was poutine

11:45.740 --> 11:47.740
Travis

11:47.740 --> 11:49.740
Really?

11:49.740 --> 11:51.740
Travis

11:51.740 --> 11:53.740
It tastes so much like gravy

11:53.740 --> 11:55.740
Travis

11:55.740 --> 11:57.740
I use the mac and cheese

11:57.740 --> 11:59.740
You guys know about how to make

11:59.740 --> 12:01.740
I call it der bad mac and cheese

12:01.740 --> 12:03.740
But you guys know about this, right?

12:03.740 --> 12:05.740
Travis

12:05.740 --> 12:07.740
I can't say that I do

12:07.740 --> 12:09.740
Travis

12:09.740 --> 12:11.740
I'm going to tell you this, give me one second

12:11.740 --> 12:13.740
Travis

12:13.740 --> 12:15.740
Are you googling a macaroni and a Kraft dinner recipe?

12:15.740 --> 12:17.740
Travis

12:17.740 --> 12:19.740
It is not my recipe

12:19.740 --> 12:21.740
It's God's recipe

12:21.740 --> 12:23.740
Travis

12:23.740 --> 12:25.740
It's God's conduit

12:25.740 --> 12:27.740
Travis

12:27.740 --> 12:29.740
It's not my recipe

12:29.740 --> 12:31.740
Travis

12:31.740 --> 12:33.740
So I need a second

12:33.740 --> 12:35.740
Travis

12:35.740 --> 12:37.740
Can I guess whose it is?

12:37.740 --> 12:39.740
Is it Guy Fieri?

12:39.740 --> 12:41.740
Travis

12:41.740 --> 12:43.740
No, it's not Guy Fieri

12:43.740 --> 12:45.740
Travis

12:45.740 --> 12:47.740
When it's called dirtbag something, he has trashcan nachos

12:47.740 --> 12:49.740
Travis

12:49.740 --> 12:51.740
I call it dirtbag

12:51.740 --> 12:53.740
Travis

12:53.740 --> 12:55.740
This method is actually by a guy named Brian Floyd

12:55.740 --> 12:57.740
Travis

12:57.740 --> 12:59.740
Thank you Brian

12:59.740 --> 13:01.740
Travis

13:01.740 --> 13:03.740
We should point out that it took Justin about 7 minutes to find this

13:03.740 --> 13:05.740
Travis

13:05.740 --> 13:07.740
Once you learn this method, you never need to refer to it again

13:07.740 --> 13:09.740
Travis

13:09.740 --> 13:11.740
Listen

13:11.740 --> 13:13.740
You dump into a saucepan

13:13.740 --> 13:15.740
The mac

13:15.740 --> 13:17.740
The cheese

13:17.740 --> 13:19.740
A cup of water

13:19.740 --> 13:21.740
Some butter

13:21.740 --> 13:23.740
And then you just cook on medium till done

13:23.740 --> 13:25.740
Travis

13:25.740 --> 13:27.740
Why is that dirty?

13:27.740 --> 13:29.740
Travis

13:29.740 --> 13:31.740
Better, faster, more delicious

13:31.740 --> 13:33.740
Travis

13:33.740 --> 13:35.740
A little bit of al dente in there

13:35.740 --> 13:37.740
Travis

13:37.740 --> 13:39.740
Yep, you've been wasting your time with your 6 cups of water

13:39.740 --> 13:41.740
You're straining

13:41.740 --> 13:43.740
All of it is a waste of time

13:43.740 --> 13:45.740
You dump it all in the pan at once and then you wait a few minutes and mac and cheese

13:45.740 --> 13:47.740
Travis

13:47.740 --> 13:49.740
That's a great method and I don't want to belittle Dr. Floyd's work

13:49.740 --> 13:51.740
Travis

13:51.740 --> 13:53.740
Well

13:53.740 --> 13:55.740
Travis

13:55.740 --> 13:57.740
When you call something dirtbag, I thought you were going to crush up some Doritos in there

13:57.740 --> 13:59.740
Make it with Mountain Dew or some shit

13:59.740 --> 14:01.740
We're from West Virginia

14:01.740 --> 14:03.740
You can't say dirtbag

14:03.740 --> 14:05.740
And I'm supposed to think it just means a little bit lazy or simple

14:05.740 --> 14:07.740
Travis

14:07.740 --> 14:09.740
That you put milk in it also

14:09.740 --> 14:11.740
Travis

14:11.740 --> 14:13.740
It's great

14:13.740 --> 14:15.740
Travis

14:15.740 --> 14:17.740
Do you think that you could just

14:17.740 --> 14:19.740
Make some artisanal cotton candy

14:19.740 --> 14:21.740
Where you actually go to the state fair, get some cotton candy

14:21.740 --> 14:23.740
Put that bad boy right in there

14:23.740 --> 14:25.740
Travis

14:25.740 --> 14:27.740
Yeah, maybe

14:27.740 --> 14:29.740
Except I didn't even ask

14:29.740 --> 14:31.740
Is there a color element to the cotton candy mix?

14:31.740 --> 14:33.740
Travis

14:33.740 --> 14:35.740
Oh, bud

14:35.740 --> 14:37.740
Are you kidding me?

14:37.740 --> 14:39.740
Travis

14:39.740 --> 14:41.740
Let me see what color maul is

14:41.740 --> 14:43.740
Travis

14:43.740 --> 14:45.740
It looks like Kirby's fucking

14:45.740 --> 14:47.740
Travis

14:47.740 --> 14:49.740
It's wild

14:49.740 --> 14:51.740
Travis

14:51.740 --> 14:53.740
Yeah, it looks like Kirby's balls

14:53.740 --> 14:55.740
Travis

14:55.740 --> 14:57.740
Anyway, as you certainly gather, this is an advice show

14:57.740 --> 14:59.740
Where we take your questions and turn them out into wisdom

14:59.740 --> 15:01.740
And here we go

15:01.740 --> 15:03.740
An aspect of my job involves collecting groundwater samples

15:03.740 --> 15:05.740
Which need to be kept on ice

15:05.740 --> 15:07.740
I usually buy ice a few times a month

15:07.740 --> 15:09.740
From gas stations, liquor stores, etc

15:09.740 --> 15:11.740
At the end of each month

15:11.740 --> 15:13.740
I submit an expense report

15:13.740 --> 15:15.740
With receipts for the ice to collect my cash

15:15.740 --> 15:17.740
The other week it was incredibly hot

15:17.740 --> 15:19.740
But when I went to a nearby gas station to buy ice

15:19.740 --> 15:21.740
I walked past the ice cream chest

15:21.740 --> 15:23.740
And grabbed a Minion popsicle

15:23.740 --> 15:25.740
Normally, I would buy personal items

15:25.740 --> 15:27.740
Separately, but the line

15:27.740 --> 15:29.740
Was long and I panicked

15:29.740 --> 15:31.740
Is it acceptable for me to submit the receipt

15:31.740 --> 15:33.740
With the Minion popsicle on it

15:33.740 --> 15:35.740
Or am I out $2.49

15:35.740 --> 15:37.740
Travis

15:37.740 --> 15:39.740
Wait, that's from Minion popsicle debacle

15:39.740 --> 15:41.740
If it had been like

15:41.740 --> 15:43.740
If it had been like

15:43.740 --> 15:45.740
Some kind of drink, any kind of drink

15:45.740 --> 15:47.740
Travis A pack of lifesavers

15:47.740 --> 15:49.740
If it had been anything

15:49.740 --> 15:51.740
But, fucking, the auditor

15:51.740 --> 15:53.740
Scanning your receipts

15:53.740 --> 15:55.740
Sees Minion popsicle

15:55.740 --> 15:57.740
In all bold

15:57.740 --> 15:59.740
And you can't say I needed it

15:59.740 --> 16:01.740
Travis You all got it twisted

16:01.740 --> 16:03.740
Yeah, you can

16:03.740 --> 16:05.740
How? If they question you on it

16:05.740 --> 16:07.740
Travis And they will

16:07.740 --> 16:09.740
Travis They were out of ice

16:09.740 --> 16:11.740
I needed anything else frozen

16:11.740 --> 16:13.740
Travis So to preserve these scientific

16:13.740 --> 16:15.740
Samples

16:15.740 --> 16:17.740
Travis You jammed, there was like one

16:17.740 --> 16:19.740
Little bit of space

16:19.740 --> 16:21.740
With no ice, and you had to just slide

16:21.740 --> 16:23.740
A popsicle right in there, they can never

16:23.740 --> 16:25.740
Prove otherwise

16:25.740 --> 16:27.740
Travis But then they can trap you like, oh, well how did it taste

16:27.740 --> 16:29.740
You'd be like, it was a Minion popsicle dude, it was delicious

16:29.740 --> 16:31.740
And they'd be like, got you

16:31.740 --> 16:33.740
Damn it Travis It tasted like banana

16:33.740 --> 16:35.740
Honestly, ironically

16:35.740 --> 16:37.740
Maybe on purpose, it tasted like banana

16:37.740 --> 16:39.740
It was great

16:39.740 --> 16:41.740
Maybe you could say, well here's the weird thing

16:41.740 --> 16:43.740
They wouldn't sell me the ice

16:43.740 --> 16:45.740
Unless I bought the popsicle

16:45.740 --> 16:47.740
It was a

16:47.740 --> 16:49.740
Here's what you're saying

16:49.740 --> 16:51.740
Yeah, it was a buy ice

16:51.740 --> 16:53.740
Get popsicle free thing, not according to this receipt

16:53.740 --> 16:55.740
Those motherfuckers Travis They fucking got me

16:55.740 --> 16:57.740
Travis This is

16:57.740 --> 16:59.740
Hey, Joan, this is how they get you, right?

16:59.740 --> 17:01.740
Am I right? Joan pounded

17:01.740 --> 17:03.740
Because we're in this thing together

17:03.740 --> 17:05.740
No one's calling the police today

17:05.740 --> 17:07.740
Right Joan? Pound it

17:07.740 --> 17:09.740
Hey Joan, can you pound it real quick?

17:09.740 --> 17:11.740
None of us have to go to, we're not going to

17:11.740 --> 17:13.740
Debtors prison

17:13.740 --> 17:15.740
When you go to Joan to get reimbursed

17:15.740 --> 17:17.740
Joan's gonna look at the receipt and be like, I don't know

17:17.740 --> 17:19.740
And then you're gonna pull out a second

17:19.740 --> 17:21.740
Minion popsicle and say, do you wanna get your beat

17:21.740 --> 17:23.740
Wet Joan?

17:23.740 --> 17:25.740
Joan, I got a taste for you

17:25.740 --> 17:27.740
Hey Joan, we can make this work, you and me

17:27.740 --> 17:29.740
We're in this together, Minion popsicles

17:29.740 --> 17:31.740
As much as we want

17:31.740 --> 17:33.740
I never ate that Minion popsicle

17:33.740 --> 17:35.740
Oh yeah Joan?

17:35.740 --> 17:37.740
And then you just dump the popsicle part in the trash

17:37.740 --> 17:39.740
And throw the stick at her, prove it

17:39.740 --> 17:41.740
I got a text message here Joan

17:41.740 --> 17:43.740
That looks like you told me to buy the popsicle for you

17:43.740 --> 17:45.740
What? That's from your dad

17:45.740 --> 17:47.740
Yeah, that's what I call you Joan

17:47.740 --> 17:49.740
How could you bring your dad into it Joan?

17:49.740 --> 17:51.740
How could you do this?

17:51.740 --> 17:53.740
You made my dad an accessory

17:53.740 --> 17:55.740
To your embezzlement?

17:55.740 --> 17:57.740
How could you Joan?

17:57.740 --> 17:59.740
There's not a job

17:59.740 --> 18:01.740
On this planet

18:01.740 --> 18:03.740
And I'm including this job

18:03.740 --> 18:05.740
If any

18:05.740 --> 18:07.740
Self-respecting human being can call

18:07.740 --> 18:09.740
What we do that

18:09.740 --> 18:11.740
Where if things aren't

18:11.740 --> 18:13.740
At least a little bit

18:13.740 --> 18:15.740
Shitty enough for you to feel

18:15.740 --> 18:17.740
Okay about stealing a popsicle

18:17.740 --> 18:19.740
From the man

18:19.740 --> 18:21.740
You know what I mean?

18:21.740 --> 18:23.740
I love this work, working with YouTube boys

18:23.740 --> 18:25.740
And I know we gotta balance those books

18:25.740 --> 18:27.740
Because we're family, and you don't fuck around with that

18:27.740 --> 18:29.740
But if I do have the opportunity to steal

18:29.740 --> 18:31.740
A minion's popsicle from

18:31.740 --> 18:33.740
Our bottom dime

18:33.740 --> 18:35.740
I would do it

18:35.740 --> 18:37.740
Even though I love this

18:37.740 --> 18:39.740
If I find out

18:39.740 --> 18:41.740
That you've been getting

18:41.740 --> 18:43.740
Minion popsicles on our dime

18:43.740 --> 18:45.740
I'm afraid of you, I'm sorry

18:45.740 --> 18:47.740
I'm so sorry, so sorry Griffin

18:47.740 --> 18:49.740
Juice, how's the Fredo flavor boost

18:49.740 --> 18:51.740
For the KD dinner?

18:51.740 --> 18:53.740
I haven't tried that one yet

18:53.740 --> 18:55.740
Just because it doesn't exist

18:55.740 --> 18:57.740
Charlie's obsessed

18:57.740 --> 18:59.740
With watching this dude on YouTube

18:59.740 --> 19:01.740
Whose whole thing is perfect popsicles

19:01.740 --> 19:03.740
Have you seen this guy?

19:03.740 --> 19:05.740
He just goes around buying up all the minion popsicles

19:05.740 --> 19:07.740
And all the SpongeBob popsicles

19:07.740 --> 19:09.740
And he's trying to find perfect ones that actually look like the packaging

19:09.740 --> 19:11.740
So it is his

19:11.740 --> 19:13.740
Maybe you could be like

19:13.740 --> 19:15.740
It was a collab

19:15.740 --> 19:17.740
You're trying to sell Joan on it

19:17.740 --> 19:19.740
Like you wanted to get into TikTok

19:19.740 --> 19:21.740
Oh here's what you say, Joan

19:21.740 --> 19:23.740
There was a hot bird outside

19:23.740 --> 19:25.740
And the bird was overheated

19:25.740 --> 19:27.740
That bird was looking at me

19:27.740 --> 19:29.740
I came back out and I had a little water bottle

19:29.740 --> 19:31.740
And it went, no! Minion!

19:31.740 --> 19:33.740
And I was like

19:33.740 --> 19:35.740
What?

19:35.740 --> 19:37.740
And I had to buy a minion popsicle, Joan

19:37.740 --> 19:39.740
Give me cold

19:39.740 --> 19:41.740
Give me minion, minion

19:41.740 --> 19:43.740
You get the

19:43.740 --> 19:45.740
I think you have to report this

19:45.740 --> 19:47.740
Because the

19:47.740 --> 19:49.740
Worst case scenario

19:49.740 --> 19:51.740
Is no one notices

19:51.740 --> 19:53.740
And then the next time you're at the store

19:53.740 --> 19:55.740
You think, well maybe I love two minion popsicles

19:55.740 --> 19:57.740
Slippery, sticky, slow

19:57.740 --> 19:59.740
And then you think

19:59.740 --> 20:01.740
Maybe I'd like

20:01.740 --> 20:03.740
Three minion popsicles

20:03.740 --> 20:05.740
Fast forward six months

20:05.740 --> 20:07.740
You're getting eight minion popsicles

20:07.740 --> 20:09.740
And you're throwing half of them away

20:09.740 --> 20:11.740
You just want to feel

20:11.740 --> 20:13.740
Who knows where this stops, ten?

20:13.740 --> 20:15.740
No

20:15.740 --> 20:17.740
Not until you're fully the grew

20:17.740 --> 20:19.740
Of popsicles

20:19.740 --> 20:21.740
No

20:21.740 --> 20:23.740
A full blown mini ice cream?

20:23.740 --> 20:25.740
Ugh

20:25.740 --> 20:27.740
Come on, man

20:27.740 --> 20:29.740
Come on, here's what you do

20:29.740 --> 20:31.740
You throw yourself at the mercy of the court

20:31.740 --> 20:33.740
You go to the highest boss

20:33.740 --> 20:35.740
You can find

20:35.740 --> 20:37.740
You fall on your knees, you tear your shirt

20:37.740 --> 20:39.740
You cry, you pull your hair out

20:39.740 --> 20:41.740
And you confess in as

20:41.740 --> 20:43.740
Dramatic terms as you can

20:43.740 --> 20:45.740
And you beg for forgiveness

20:45.740 --> 20:47.740
And I guarantee you

20:47.740 --> 20:49.740
The next eight times

20:49.740 --> 20:51.740
They're not going to check your receipts

20:51.740 --> 20:53.740
No way

20:53.740 --> 20:55.740
You can put anything on there

20:55.740 --> 20:57.740
They don't want you to apologize to them anymore

20:57.740 --> 20:59.740
It was really uncomfortable

20:59.740 --> 21:01.740
I think I'm becoming more

21:01.740 --> 21:03.740
And more

21:03.740 --> 21:05.740
Dead set on you just looking them in the eyes

21:05.740 --> 21:07.740
And saying, it's different ice

21:07.740 --> 21:09.740
Yeah

21:09.740 --> 21:11.740
It's just different ice

21:11.740 --> 21:13.740
And in many ways better ice, really

21:13.740 --> 21:15.740
It's boutique ice

21:15.740 --> 21:17.740
It's gross ass water I had to get from

21:17.740 --> 21:19.740
The mud

21:19.740 --> 21:21.740
Excuse me, cause I thought that I could

21:21.740 --> 21:23.740
You said buy ice

21:23.740 --> 21:25.740
And this is ice

21:25.740 --> 21:27.740
Part of my job is going to a liquor store

21:27.740 --> 21:29.740
I bought a minion popsicle

21:29.740 --> 21:31.740
Are you going to judge me for the minion popsicle?

21:31.740 --> 21:33.740
Do you know how much worse this could be?

21:33.740 --> 21:35.740
I could have bought 18 bottles of

21:35.740 --> 21:37.740
Boons Farm, and I bought a minion

21:37.740 --> 21:39.740
A $2.40

21:39.740 --> 21:41.740
Jeff Bezos flew to

21:41.740 --> 21:43.740
Outer space and I bought a $2.49

21:43.740 --> 21:45.740
Popsicle and you're going to get mad at

21:45.740 --> 21:47.740
Me, Joan? What is this?

21:47.740 --> 21:49.740
Unbelievable

21:49.740 --> 21:51.740
Be honest about it

21:51.740 --> 21:53.740
But don't be embarrassed

21:53.740 --> 21:55.740
No, just be honest

21:55.740 --> 21:57.740
But not chagrined

21:57.740 --> 21:59.740
Oh yeah, a sick kid wanted it

21:59.740 --> 22:01.740
That's another good one

22:01.740 --> 22:03.740
Yeah, that's always a great one that feels good to do

22:03.740 --> 22:05.740
And joke about it

22:05.740 --> 22:07.740
Hey, can we approach the wizard humbly

22:07.740 --> 22:09.740
And supplicate ourselves

22:09.740 --> 22:11.740
Before his throne? Yeah, I do

22:11.740 --> 22:13.740
I was hoping to get some courage

22:13.740 --> 22:15.740
No

22:15.740 --> 22:17.740
What about, can I interest you in some

22:17.740 --> 22:19.740
Snow power?

22:19.740 --> 22:21.740
How about hubris?

22:21.740 --> 22:23.740
No, you already have that

22:23.740 --> 22:25.740
Graham Roebuck sent this one in, thank you Graham

22:25.740 --> 22:27.740
This one was

22:27.740 --> 22:29.740
Just updated June 1st of this year

22:29.740 --> 22:31.740
So it's like, you know, it's going to mention

22:31.740 --> 22:33.740
Covid, probably

22:33.740 --> 22:35.740
It's called How to Appear to Have Snow Power

22:35.740 --> 22:37.740
Oh, hey!

22:37.740 --> 22:39.740
Snow power is a form of magic

22:39.740 --> 22:41.740
A character who lives in snow encased environments

22:41.740 --> 22:43.740
Might have, such as Elsa from Frozen

22:43.740 --> 22:45.740
Name one more!

22:45.740 --> 22:47.740
Name another!

22:47.740 --> 22:49.740
The Ice King from

22:49.740 --> 22:51.740
Ice Man

22:51.740 --> 22:53.740
Does Ice Man from the X-Men live in a

22:53.740 --> 22:55.740
Magical snow encased environment?

22:55.740 --> 22:57.740
Nobody is an omega level mutant

22:57.740 --> 22:59.740
I would say that this is like more

22:59.740 --> 23:01.740
It's like less impressive if you

23:01.740 --> 23:03.740
Live in a snow environment

23:03.740 --> 23:05.740
And you have snow powers

23:05.740 --> 23:07.740
And to be fair, WikiWizard

23:07.740 --> 23:09.740
Elsa didn't live in a snow encased environment

23:09.740 --> 23:11.740
It was summer

23:11.740 --> 23:13.740
When she used her snow powers to create

23:13.740 --> 23:15.740
The eternal blizzard

23:15.740 --> 23:17.740
Come on

23:17.740 --> 23:19.740
So here's how to convince people that you

23:19.740 --> 23:21.740
Have snow powers

23:21.740 --> 23:23.740
I think everybody gets it

23:23.740 --> 23:25.740
One, wear gloves that have

23:25.740 --> 23:27.740
Faux snow on them, that's easy

23:27.740 --> 23:29.740
Glitter, small cotton ball puffs

23:29.740 --> 23:31.740
White rolls of yarn

23:31.740 --> 23:33.740
That doesn't seem convincing though

23:33.740 --> 23:35.740
It's not the only fucking thing you do, Travis

23:35.740 --> 23:37.740
Give me a minute

23:37.740 --> 23:39.740
You can get black gloves for a dollar with snow

23:39.740 --> 23:41.740
Already on them from dollar stores

23:41.740 --> 23:43.740
What? I didn't know that they did that

23:43.740 --> 23:45.740
America's the best country in the world

23:45.740 --> 23:47.740
This is the best, you can get everything

23:47.740 --> 23:49.740
Wear all blue and white

23:49.740 --> 23:51.740
Yeah, that's ice and snow colors

23:51.740 --> 23:53.740
You can't do orange or red or whatever

23:53.740 --> 23:55.740
Also, when you make it snow, wearing a long

23:55.740 --> 23:57.740
Sash on your sleeves will give it a great effect

23:57.740 --> 23:59.740
If the sashes have glitter, even better

23:59.740 --> 24:01.740
Or a simple necklace

24:01.740 --> 24:03.740
With a sophisticated charm

24:03.740 --> 24:05.740
A snowflake with a simple white beads would be nice

24:05.740 --> 24:07.740
Pretty sophisticated

24:07.740 --> 24:09.740
I would say that

24:09.740 --> 24:11.740
I don't know if that's a sophisticated...

24:11.740 --> 24:13.740
Anyway, this is where it gets really hot

24:13.740 --> 24:15.740
By which I mean cold

24:15.740 --> 24:17.740
Showing your snow powers, part two

24:17.740 --> 24:19.740
One, act apart

24:19.740 --> 24:21.740
Try to make somebody curious enough to watch you

24:21.740 --> 24:23.740
Not sure what that means

24:23.740 --> 24:25.740
Who said that? Me

24:25.740 --> 24:27.740
If you were walking

24:27.740 --> 24:29.740
Around a park

24:29.740 --> 24:31.740
With your kid

24:31.740 --> 24:33.740
And you saw somebody

24:33.740 --> 24:35.740
Stride forward, wearing

24:35.740 --> 24:37.740
Blue and white, with black gloves

24:37.740 --> 24:39.740
With glitter on them, and some

24:39.740 --> 24:41.740
Flowing things, and they began to

24:41.740 --> 24:43.740
Sway and swirl their arms

24:43.740 --> 24:45.740
You'd stop

24:45.740 --> 24:47.740
You'd look

24:47.740 --> 24:49.740
These next two sentences are so good

24:49.740 --> 24:51.740
First of all

24:51.740 --> 24:53.740
It said, use white glitter or similar items

24:53.740 --> 24:55.740
To make it seem like snow

24:55.740 --> 24:57.740
It might seem odd, but you could always play Christmas music

24:57.740 --> 24:59.740
To set the tone if you wish

24:59.740 --> 25:01.740
Jingle bells, jingle bells

25:01.740 --> 25:03.740
You just threw glitter

25:03.740 --> 25:05.740
On my fucking

25:05.740 --> 25:07.740
Taco bell, I was gonna eat this

25:07.740 --> 25:09.740
I did snow on it

25:09.740 --> 25:11.740
So these two sentences

25:11.740 --> 25:13.740
If using real snow, this is best done during wintertime

25:13.740 --> 25:15.740
To make it more believable

25:15.740 --> 25:17.740
The snow would melt in summer, excellent

25:17.740 --> 25:19.740
That's excellent stuff

25:19.740 --> 25:21.740
This one's dope, because I don't know what the fuck it means

25:21.740 --> 25:23.740
When you're at

25:23.740 --> 25:25.740
Your secret place

25:25.740 --> 25:27.740
Start to play around in the snow

25:27.740 --> 25:29.740
With your bare hands, if you can bare it

25:29.740 --> 25:31.740
And throw it in the air

25:31.740 --> 25:33.740
Do this for a few times, then look at your hands

25:33.740 --> 25:35.740
Smile and get ready to do your trick

25:35.740 --> 25:37.740
Oh my fuck

25:37.740 --> 25:39.740
It's gotta be wintertime, because if you try to do this in summer

25:39.740 --> 25:41.740
People will be like, um, excuse me

25:41.740 --> 25:43.740
It's the hot season

25:43.740 --> 25:45.740
And that's snow

25:45.740 --> 25:47.740
I don't think so

25:47.740 --> 25:49.740
You're gonna embarrass yourself

25:49.740 --> 25:51.740
But more importantly, you gotta be in your secret place

25:51.740 --> 25:53.740
When you're practicing this

25:53.740 --> 25:55.740
Imagine

25:55.740 --> 25:57.740
These two sentences, that sentence about the secret place

25:57.740 --> 25:59.740
Is referring only

25:59.740 --> 26:01.740
And especially to

26:01.740 --> 26:03.740
Superman and the fortress of solitude

26:03.740 --> 26:05.740
Yes, exactly

26:05.740 --> 26:07.740
Make the snow appear to, quote, come out of your hands

26:07.740 --> 26:09.740
If you have very large sleeves

26:09.740 --> 26:11.740
You can try this neat trick

26:11.740 --> 26:13.740
Get two small fans and secretly put them

26:13.740 --> 26:15.740
Down your sleeves, get some of the faux snow

26:15.740 --> 26:17.740
And put it on top of the fans, turn on the fans

26:17.740 --> 26:19.740
Secretly and open your hands wide so that it goes through your fingers

26:19.740 --> 26:21.740
And appears to come out of your hands

26:21.740 --> 26:23.740
But hey, if you can't get the fans

26:23.740 --> 26:25.740
Don't worry, just stuff some of the fake snow

26:25.740 --> 26:27.740
In your sleeves and twirl around with your sleeves

26:27.740 --> 26:29.740
Down, causing the snow to slip out of your sleeves

26:29.740 --> 26:31.740
But this is not recommended because you'll look like

26:31.740 --> 26:33.740
You're dripping wet afterwards

26:33.740 --> 26:35.740
Slip snow out of your sleeves in moderation

26:35.740 --> 26:37.740
But practice this for a few times

26:37.740 --> 26:39.740
Before the real deal

26:39.740 --> 26:41.740
In a private place

26:41.740 --> 26:43.740
In your secret place

26:43.740 --> 26:45.740
Practice shoving

26:45.740 --> 26:47.740
White cotton that looks like snow

26:47.740 --> 26:49.740
Up your sleeves and then just

26:49.740 --> 26:51.740
Because you're not getting two fans

26:51.740 --> 26:53.740
Up your sleeves, that's fucking ridiculous

26:53.740 --> 26:55.740
So you're gonna do the other way

26:55.740 --> 26:57.740
Where you just let it kind of

26:57.740 --> 26:59.740
Impotently

26:59.740 --> 27:01.740
Jizz out of your

27:01.740 --> 27:03.740
Of your arms to the floor

27:03.740 --> 27:05.740
And people are like, did you just do snow power?

27:05.740 --> 27:07.740
And you say, I don't

27:07.740 --> 27:09.740
I don't know, don't ask me about it

27:09.740 --> 27:11.740
I'm still practicing, I gotta go to my secret place

27:11.740 --> 27:13.740
This is stupid, this is supposed to be my secret place

27:13.740 --> 27:15.740
I don't even know why I chose this power

27:15.740 --> 27:17.740
I could have done fire power and there's a lot of things

27:17.740 --> 27:19.740
You can light on fire

27:19.740 --> 27:21.740
React while you're making snow

27:21.740 --> 27:23.740
Always look like you're enjoying yourself

27:23.740 --> 27:25.740
Laugh a lot and twirl around

27:25.740 --> 27:27.740
Now, alternatively though

27:27.740 --> 27:29.740
You could scream in horror at your own power

27:29.740 --> 27:31.740
That now you wield without

27:31.740 --> 27:33.740
Any kind of responsibility or understanding

27:33.740 --> 27:35.740
That is how I think

27:35.740 --> 27:37.740
It would really work in real life

27:37.740 --> 27:39.740
If I suddenly started shooting

27:39.740 --> 27:41.740
Snow and ice out of my hands

27:41.740 --> 27:43.740
I don't think I'd be like

27:43.740 --> 27:45.740
I think I'd be like, oh no

27:45.740 --> 27:47.740
Why is it conceit that it's the first time it's ever happened to you though?

27:47.740 --> 27:49.740
If you're convincing anyone

27:49.740 --> 27:51.740
You're convincing yourself

27:51.740 --> 27:53.740
True, that's the first step

27:53.740 --> 27:55.740
If you're pretending to hide your snow powers

27:55.740 --> 27:57.740
Do the following, after you run out of snow

27:57.740 --> 27:59.740
Toss the snow on the ground in the air

27:59.740 --> 28:01.740
Then seem to notice the person

28:01.740 --> 28:03.740
Start to look worried, run up to the person and beg

28:03.740 --> 28:05.740
Please don't tell anyone

28:05.740 --> 28:07.740
And you're done

28:07.740 --> 28:09.740
Oh

28:09.740 --> 28:11.740
You're not quite done though

28:11.740 --> 28:13.740
Because step four is try this out on your friends

28:13.740 --> 28:15.740
Before doing it at a fancy dress or cosplay event

28:15.740 --> 28:17.740
I like that trap

28:17.740 --> 28:19.740
What would someone

28:19.740 --> 28:21.740
Have to do

28:21.740 --> 28:23.740
To display ice or snow powers to you

28:23.740 --> 28:25.740
To me?

28:25.740 --> 28:27.740
That would make you believe that they actually had

28:27.740 --> 28:29.740
Ice or snow powers and weren't just faking it

28:29.740 --> 28:31.740
Because I worry

28:31.740 --> 28:33.740
That if we found out magic was real

28:33.740 --> 28:35.740
Or if magic was real in this world

28:35.740 --> 28:37.740
We would all be so skeptical

28:37.740 --> 28:39.740
That no level of

28:39.740 --> 28:41.740
Something would allow us to

28:41.740 --> 28:43.740
Believe it was real

28:43.740 --> 28:45.740
I would demonstrate for you to believe

28:45.740 --> 28:47.740
If the air

28:47.740 --> 28:49.740
Around this

28:49.740 --> 28:51.740
This sorcerer

28:51.740 --> 28:53.740
This warlock

28:53.740 --> 28:55.740
Let's call Elsa what she is, a warlock

28:55.740 --> 28:57.740
A dark ice patron

28:57.740 --> 28:59.740
And legal with the devil

28:59.740 --> 29:01.740
It might be Satan

29:01.740 --> 29:03.740
If the air around them

29:03.740 --> 29:05.740
Became superheated

29:05.740 --> 29:07.740
As they did this

29:07.740 --> 29:09.740
Thus sort of fulfilling

29:09.740 --> 29:11.740
The law of thermodynamics

29:11.740 --> 29:13.740
Then I might buy into this shit

29:13.740 --> 29:15.740
But if somebody just starts throwing snow around

29:15.740 --> 29:17.740
I'll be like, oh, where did the

29:17.740 --> 29:19.740
Heat go? You know what I mean?

29:19.740 --> 29:21.740
Because I got like a scientist

29:21.740 --> 29:23.740
Way of looking at things sometimes

29:23.740 --> 29:25.740
I always actually like that about you

29:25.740 --> 29:27.740
Yeah, I love that too, very analytical

29:27.740 --> 29:29.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah

29:29.740 --> 29:31.740
A mind of sciences mind

29:31.740 --> 29:33.740
So good questions on this one, but I want to just

29:33.740 --> 29:35.740
Drill down on this one. Can I just say the weird thing is

29:35.740 --> 29:37.740
If somebody had the ability

29:37.740 --> 29:39.740
To make snow, but it only dribbled

29:39.740 --> 29:41.740
Impotently from their sleeves

29:41.740 --> 29:43.740
But that was how the power worked and it was actually magic

29:43.740 --> 29:45.740
I would never believe them

29:45.740 --> 29:47.740
And I would feel terrible

29:47.740 --> 29:49.740
They'd be like, look what I can do

29:49.740 --> 29:51.740
I'm like, that's just fucking, you had some snow

29:51.740 --> 29:53.740
Stuff up your sleeve, I'm like, no, you don't

29:53.740 --> 29:55.740
Understand, this is just how

29:55.740 --> 29:57.740
It works. I think some effort

29:57.740 --> 29:59.740
Would actually make me believe it a bit more if the

29:59.740 --> 30:01.740
Snow just impotently dribbled out of their

30:01.740 --> 30:03.740
Sleeve and they were going like

30:05.740 --> 30:07.740
And I'd be like, whoa, damn, you're working really hard

30:07.740 --> 30:09.740
To make that snow. That's crazy

30:09.740 --> 30:11.740
You look really dehydrated, are you okay?

30:11.740 --> 30:13.740
Yeah, I mean that water's gotta come from

30:13.740 --> 30:15.740
Somewhere. Okay, I want to drill down on this question

30:15.740 --> 30:17.740
Okay. How do I

30:17.740 --> 30:19.740
Make it look like I've got more snow power?

30:19.740 --> 30:21.740
Oh boy

30:21.740 --> 30:23.740
This is always the fear

30:23.740 --> 30:25.740
Isn't it? I mean, this is the danger that you run

30:25.740 --> 30:27.740
Do something else. What?

30:27.740 --> 30:29.740
Oh man

30:29.740 --> 30:31.740
The community answered, try to keep some with

30:31.740 --> 30:33.740
You at all times and while the person isn't looking

30:33.740 --> 30:35.740
Put more in your sleeves to make it look like you

30:35.740 --> 30:37.740
Have unlimited power

30:39.740 --> 30:41.740
27 people found that helpful

30:41.740 --> 30:43.740
60 people found that not helpful

30:43.740 --> 30:45.740
Just loudly announce, now look

30:45.740 --> 30:47.740
At my snow pockets and just start

30:47.740 --> 30:49.740
Pulling snow out of your pockets

30:49.740 --> 30:51.740
This is some snow that I made earlier with

30:51.740 --> 30:53.740
Magic

30:53.740 --> 30:55.740
Snow problem for

30:55.740 --> 30:57.740
Me

30:57.740 --> 30:59.740
That's the crowd clapping

30:59.740 --> 31:01.740
At that pun. Yeah, it was good

31:01.740 --> 31:03.740
You know what I think? I think we've earned

31:03.740 --> 31:05.740
A trip to the money zone. Already? Just for that

31:05.740 --> 31:07.740
Yeah, just with that. Shit, hold on, before

31:07.740 --> 31:09.740
Wait, I gotta step on the brakes for a second because there's

31:09.740 --> 31:11.740
A warning at the bottom here. I've never seen a

31:11.740 --> 31:13.740
Warning on a wikiHow article before

31:13.740 --> 31:15.740
And this is important, I want to cover us

31:15.740 --> 31:17.740
Legally by reciting this

31:17.740 --> 31:19.740
Warning. Don't

31:19.740 --> 31:21.740
Make it obvious that you're faking. Be sure

31:21.740 --> 31:23.740
To use good acting skills

31:23.740 --> 31:25.740
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

31:25.740 --> 31:27.740
Now, this is the kind of wikiHow that irritates

31:27.740 --> 31:29.740
Me because now I have to go read one about

31:29.740 --> 31:31.740
Good acting. I know, damn it

31:31.740 --> 31:33.740
That's what Joaquin Phoenix did

31:33.740 --> 31:35.740
That's it, when he got pooped on by

31:35.740 --> 31:37.740
His buddy. When he really

31:37.740 --> 31:39.740
Became the snoker

31:39.740 --> 31:41.740
That's okay, we can go to the money zone on that

31:41.740 --> 31:43.740
Yeah, now I think

31:43.740 --> 31:45.740
Yeah, why so serious?

31:53.740 --> 31:55.740

33:15.740 --> 33:17.740
That was all in the copy

33:23.740 --> 33:25.740

33:27.740 --> 33:29.740
I'm glad we could be here for them

33:29.740 --> 33:31.740
This is Stitch Fix

They send you a box full of clothes

33:33.740 --> 33:35.740

33:35.740 --> 33:37.740

33:37.740 --> 33:39.740
Pants is one of the things they have in the box sometimes

33:39.740 --> 33:41.740
Jacket

33:41.740 --> 33:43.740
Shoes

33:43.740 --> 33:45.740
Belt

33:45.740 --> 33:47.740
I got a tie!

33:47.740 --> 33:49.740
Yeah, fucking ties

33:49.740 --> 33:51.740
And you don't need to go to the store to buy them

33:51.740 --> 33:53.740
You try the tie on and they're like

33:53.740 --> 33:55.740
That tie on your

33:55.740 --> 33:57.740
Neck? And then you get fucking

33:57.740 --> 33:59.740
Sad and you

33:59.740 --> 34:01.740
Run out of the mall

34:01.740 --> 34:03.740
And you get hit by a car

34:03.740 --> 34:05.740
In the parking lot

34:05.740 --> 34:07.740
All because you got made fun of

34:07.740 --> 34:09.740

Neck? No way, Stitch Fix is here

34:11.740 --> 34:13.740

35:27.740 --> 35:29.740
Is that I took all

35:29.740 --> 35:31.740
Of the cushions off the couch

I want to munch

36:05.740 --> 36:07.740
Squad

36:07.740 --> 36:11.740
Got a Michael Giacchino vibe here

36:11.740 --> 36:13.740
And I'm taking it

36:13.740 --> 36:15.740
Listen, this is the most important

36:15.740 --> 36:17.740
Munch Squad that I've ever done

36:17.740 --> 36:19.740
And I'm trying, I want to

36:19.740 --> 36:21.740
You know how before Walter Cronkite

36:21.740 --> 36:23.740
Like you remember when he

36:23.740 --> 36:25.740
Was about to watch them open the moon

36:25.740 --> 36:27.740
Door and he was thinking like

36:27.740 --> 36:29.740
I gotta say fucking something

36:29.740 --> 36:31.740
You know what I mean?

36:31.740 --> 36:33.740
And he said like everybody shut up, everybody shut up

36:33.740 --> 36:35.740
Watch this, watch this fucking thing

36:35.740 --> 36:37.740
I also

36:37.740 --> 36:39.740
Wonder like if he was wondering

36:39.740 --> 36:41.740
If the moon guy was going to say something

36:41.740 --> 36:43.740
That he didn't want to talk over

36:43.740 --> 36:45.740
You know what I mean?

36:45.740 --> 36:47.740
This is like that moment

36:47.740 --> 36:49.740
Popeye's launches

36:49.740 --> 36:51.740
Nuggets

36:51.740 --> 36:53.740
Calls for cease fire

36:53.740 --> 36:55.740
In the chicken wars

36:55.740 --> 36:57.740
Oh my god

36:57.740 --> 37:01.740
Let's listen before we comment on this

37:01.740 --> 37:03.740
And get too deep into it

37:03.740 --> 37:05.740
Let's just listen to the

37:05.740 --> 37:07.740
This is what they're going with

37:07.740 --> 37:11.740
Remember what happened when we launched the chicken sandwich

37:11.740 --> 37:13.740
These clips of them

37:13.740 --> 37:15.740
Selling it

37:15.740 --> 37:17.740
Chicken wars

37:17.740 --> 37:19.740
Chicken wars

37:21.740 --> 37:23.740
But now we're ending the chicken wars

37:23.740 --> 37:25.740
Now the chicken wars are over

37:25.740 --> 37:27.740
We come in peace

37:31.740 --> 37:33.740
We come in peace

37:33.740 --> 37:35.740
We come in peace

37:37.740 --> 37:39.740
So what they're saying is

37:41.740 --> 37:43.740
We know we walked into a room

37:45.740 --> 37:47.740
And kicked over the trash can

37:47.740 --> 37:49.740
And then left the room and then came back later

37:49.740 --> 37:51.740
And we're like you guys

37:51.740 --> 37:53.740
Nobody cleaned this up yet

37:53.740 --> 37:55.740
But now we're saying

37:55.740 --> 37:57.740
The chicken wars

37:57.740 --> 37:59.740
Have ended

37:59.740 --> 38:01.740
I will say this is

38:01.740 --> 38:03.740
I'm surprised some of you

38:03.740 --> 38:05.740
But I don't know a lot about war

38:05.740 --> 38:07.740
And how it works and stuff

38:07.740 --> 38:09.740
But can you be

38:09.740 --> 38:11.740
Can you start the war

38:11.740 --> 38:13.740
And now it's done

38:13.740 --> 38:15.740
And be like what

38:15.740 --> 38:17.740
Fine

38:17.740 --> 38:19.740
You can't, no Travis

38:19.740 --> 38:21.740
You can't do that

38:21.740 --> 38:23.740
You can't just say

38:23.740 --> 38:25.740
We did a war

38:25.740 --> 38:27.740
But now we're tired of the war

38:27.740 --> 38:29.740
Because we're doing the different things

38:29.740 --> 38:31.740
I've played Risk enough that I don't think you could

38:31.740 --> 38:33.740
You can't invade some countries

38:33.740 --> 38:35.740
On Risk and then be like

38:35.740 --> 38:37.740
Okay I'm done now so don't like come back at me

38:37.740 --> 38:39.740
Okay

38:39.740 --> 38:41.740
The launch of our chicken sandwich was incredible

38:41.740 --> 38:43.740
And we're humbled by the amount of love

38:43.740 --> 38:45.740
And positive reviews

38:45.740 --> 38:47.740
But at the same time many claim that it started

38:47.740 --> 38:49.740
The chicken wars

38:49.740 --> 38:51.740
Said CMO Bruno Cardinale

38:51.740 --> 38:53.740
In a statement

38:53.740 --> 38:55.740
Now it's time to say goodbye to the chicken wars

38:55.740 --> 38:57.740
And celebrate our new nuggets

38:57.740 --> 38:59.740
Because we come in peace

38:59.740 --> 39:01.740
Eight piece to be exact

39:01.740 --> 39:03.740
To prove it's serious about ending the chicken wars

39:03.740 --> 39:05.740
The Popeye's Foundation

39:05.740 --> 39:07.740
We'll pay a wear guild

39:07.740 --> 39:09.740
To everyone we killed

39:09.740 --> 39:11.740
The Popeye's Foundation

39:11.740 --> 39:13.740
Purchased the cash equivalent

39:13.740 --> 39:15.740
Of one million nuggets

39:15.740 --> 39:17.740
From Popeye's restaurants

39:17.740 --> 39:19.740
As well as competing brands

39:19.740 --> 39:21.740
McDonald's, Wendy's, Chick-fil-A, and Burger King

39:21.740 --> 39:23.740
The foundation will donate the funds

39:23.740 --> 39:25.740
To Second Harvest Food Bank

39:25.740 --> 39:27.740
Of Greater New Orleans

39:27.740 --> 39:29.740
And customers may visit

39:29.740 --> 39:31.740
The Popeye's Foundation website to donate

39:31.740 --> 39:33.740
And Popeye's will match the contributions

39:33.740 --> 39:35.740
Of up to $25,000

39:35.740 --> 39:37.740
What they're saying here

39:37.740 --> 39:39.740
And it's very tough to parse

39:39.740 --> 39:41.740
But my understanding is

39:41.740 --> 39:43.740
That they bought a million chicken nuggets

39:43.740 --> 39:45.740
And took them to a shelter

39:45.740 --> 39:47.740
Is that what happened here?

39:47.740 --> 39:49.740
Could you read it again?

39:49.740 --> 39:51.740
Because it does sound

39:51.740 --> 39:53.740
It's so hard to follow

39:53.740 --> 39:55.740
The Popeye's Foundation

39:55.740 --> 39:57.740
Purchased the cash equivalent

39:57.740 --> 39:59.740
Of one million nuggets

39:59.740 --> 40:01.740
How is that money?

40:01.740 --> 40:03.740
You bought money of nuggets?

40:03.740 --> 40:05.740
What are you talking about?

40:05.740 --> 40:07.740
Because the videos they have to

40:07.740 --> 40:09.740
Accompany this just shows a single Popeye's

40:09.740 --> 40:11.740
Employee going door to door

40:11.740 --> 40:13.740
At McDonald's and Wendy's and all these other places

40:13.740 --> 40:15.740
Just like, I'd like to buy all the chicken nuggets

40:15.740 --> 40:17.740
You have

40:17.740 --> 40:19.740
For some reason

40:19.740 --> 40:21.740
I don't know, I'll think of it

40:21.740 --> 40:23.740
I think that they're saying

40:23.740 --> 40:25.740
The Popeye's Foundation

40:25.740 --> 40:27.740
Is donating the equivalent

40:27.740 --> 40:29.740
But to say we purchased the cash equivalent

40:29.740 --> 40:31.740
Of nuggets

40:31.740 --> 40:33.740
What could that mean?

40:33.740 --> 40:35.740
I mean, what are they saying?

40:35.740 --> 40:37.740
They bought the cash equivalent

40:37.740 --> 40:39.740
Of a million nuggets

40:39.740 --> 40:41.740
At different stores

40:41.740 --> 40:43.740
And then donated the money

40:43.740 --> 40:45.740
What are you saying?

40:45.740 --> 40:47.740
Our hope is that today

40:47.740 --> 40:49.740
Guests who finally try our new

40:49.740 --> 40:51.740
Chicken nuggets will say to themselves

40:51.740 --> 40:53.740
Popeye's did it again

40:53.740 --> 40:55.740
Started another war

40:55.740 --> 40:57.740
Started another fucking war

40:57.740 --> 40:59.740
A cuter war

40:59.740 --> 41:01.740
We would like to call for a ceasefire

41:01.740 --> 41:03.740
By invading a different country now

41:03.740 --> 41:05.740
Bruno

41:05.740 --> 41:07.740
Continued, this is I think

41:07.740 --> 41:09.740
Where things really start to

41:09.740 --> 41:11.740
The rails

41:11.740 --> 41:13.740
Those two things together

41:13.740 --> 41:15.740
The product quality

41:15.740 --> 41:17.740
And the strong marketing campaign he's referring to here

41:17.740 --> 41:19.740
Those two things together

41:19.740 --> 41:21.740
They're really the recipe for the success of our brand

41:21.740 --> 41:23.740
And I'm very confident

41:23.740 --> 41:25.740
We have those two ingredients here

41:25.740 --> 41:27.740
This time with the nuggets

41:27.740 --> 41:29.740
The product tastes

41:29.740 --> 41:31.740
Amazing

41:31.740 --> 41:33.740
The campaign, I think

41:33.740 --> 41:35.740
It's very, very timely

41:35.740 --> 41:37.740
Very relevant

41:37.740 --> 41:39.740
It speaks to a cultural moment

41:39.740 --> 41:41.740
An iconic moment

41:41.740 --> 41:43.740
That happened in America

41:43.740 --> 41:45.740
Two years ago

41:45.740 --> 41:47.740
That cultural moment

41:47.740 --> 41:49.740
And really delivering something that is relevant

41:49.740 --> 41:51.740
That is unique to Popeye's

41:51.740 --> 41:53.740
And really puts Popeye's in the

41:53.740 --> 41:55.740
Center of the conversation

41:55.740 --> 41:57.740
Hey, the war's over

41:57.740 --> 41:59.740
Guys, we're bigger than this

41:59.740 --> 42:01.740
But Popeye's did it

42:01.740 --> 42:03.740
And we're in the middle of it, and we did it

42:03.740 --> 42:05.740
And it's us, and the war's over

42:05.740 --> 42:07.740
And we'll do it again

42:07.740 --> 42:09.740
I think we all agree the war's over

42:09.740 --> 42:11.740
And we fucking won

42:11.740 --> 42:17.740
We have annexed cluckers

42:17.740 --> 42:19.740
We have annexed cluckers

42:19.740 --> 42:21.740
All cluckers are now Popeye's

42:21.740 --> 42:27.740
Oh my god, the gall

42:27.740 --> 42:29.740
The absolute wild thing about this though

42:29.740 --> 42:31.740
Is that in like the late 80's

42:31.740 --> 42:33.740
There were pizza wars

42:33.740 --> 42:35.740
Which was like an iconic thing

42:35.740 --> 42:39.740
And it feels like they want that

42:39.740 --> 42:41.740
Again?

42:41.740 --> 42:43.740
And it could be

42:43.740 --> 42:45.740
And I don't fucking know anymore

42:45.740 --> 42:47.740
I don't know anymore

42:47.740 --> 42:49.740
Can I talk about something else real quick?

42:49.740 --> 42:51.740
This is unrelated, but I did want to mention it

42:51.740 --> 42:53.740
Long John Silvers has partnered with Gathered Foods

42:53.740 --> 42:55.740
To debut

42:55.740 --> 42:57.740
Plant-based

42:57.740 --> 42:59.740
Seafood

42:59.740 --> 43:01.740
And the ad for this

43:01.740 --> 43:03.740
There's an ad for it

43:03.740 --> 43:05.740
And it just says plant-based seafood is now a thing

43:05.740 --> 43:07.740
Awesome

43:07.740 --> 43:09.740
That's good

43:09.740 --> 43:11.740
That's about as much earnestness as I want behind this announcement

43:11.740 --> 43:17.740
Customers will be able to choose from two Long John Silvers classic menu items

43:17.740 --> 43:19.740
Now with a plant-based twist

43:19.740 --> 43:21.740
Good catch

43:21.740 --> 43:23.740
Crab-free cakes

43:23.740 --> 43:25.740
Which I would argue most cakes are

43:25.740 --> 43:27.740
Yes

43:27.740 --> 43:29.740
But not all cakes

43:29.740 --> 43:31.740
Not all cakes

43:31.740 --> 43:35.740
Are packed with 15 grams of plant-based protein per serving

43:35.740 --> 43:37.740
Features lump crab meat tastes

43:37.740 --> 43:39.740
Mmm

43:39.740 --> 43:41.740
What an appetizing concept

43:41.740 --> 43:43.740
Okay

43:43.740 --> 43:45.740
This is what it literally says

43:45.740 --> 43:47.740
It features lump crab meat tastes

43:47.740 --> 43:49.740
And texture complemented with sweet peppers

43:49.740 --> 43:51.740
Green onions, parsley, and a kick of spice

43:51.740 --> 43:53.740
If a filet is what you're after

43:53.740 --> 43:55.740
Good catch fish-free filets

43:55.740 --> 43:57.740
Are crispy breaded

43:57.740 --> 43:59.740
Tender flaky white fish texture

43:59.740 --> 44:01.740
You're looking for

44:01.740 --> 44:03.740
Are they skipping every third word

44:03.740 --> 44:05.740
In this announcement

44:05.740 --> 44:11.740
Our mission is to make the unique seafood experience from the coasts available to all

44:11.740 --> 44:13.740
Says Christopher Caudill

44:13.740 --> 44:15.740
So we're mushing up a bunch of beans

44:15.740 --> 44:17.740
I guess

44:17.740 --> 44:19.740
We're mushing up a bunch of beans

44:19.740 --> 44:21.740
And frying them because our mission is to bring seafood

44:21.740 --> 44:23.740
To the planet

44:23.740 --> 44:25.740
We believe plant-based seafood

44:25.740 --> 44:27.740
Furthers that mission by making Long John Silvers

44:27.740 --> 44:29.740
Accessible to guests who are hungry

44:29.740 --> 44:31.740
For more plant-based protein

44:31.740 --> 44:33.740
Option

44:33.740 --> 44:35.740
It's also a great addition for fans

44:35.740 --> 44:37.740
Of our classic sustainably sourced

44:37.740 --> 44:39.740
Wild caught fish who are curious

44:39.740 --> 44:41.740
About a new take on their

44:41.740 --> 44:43.740
Seafood favorites

44:43.740 --> 44:45.740
We're excited to set sail with good catch

44:45.740 --> 44:47.740
On this test

44:47.740 --> 44:49.740
I'm really curious and listeners if you could

44:49.740 --> 44:51.740
Tweet with the hashtag NBNBAM

44:51.740 --> 44:53.740
After this episode goes out

44:53.740 --> 44:55.740
If you're a vegan or a vegetarian

44:55.740 --> 44:57.740
Or I mean maybe you just don't eat

44:57.740 --> 44:59.740
Fish for sustainability

44:59.740 --> 45:01.740
Or whatever reasons

45:01.740 --> 45:03.740
How many of you have been longing

45:03.740 --> 45:05.740
To go to Long John Silvers

45:05.740 --> 45:07.740
But there just weren't options

45:07.740 --> 45:09.740
You tried my Long John Silvers and you're just salivating

45:09.740 --> 45:11.740
Oh if only I could

45:11.740 --> 45:13.740
But there's no options

45:13.740 --> 45:15.740
You just think about the fact that they'll sell you

45:15.740 --> 45:17.740
A container of lard cast-offs

45:17.740 --> 45:19.740
For 75 cents

45:19.740 --> 45:21.740
Crunchy lard cast-offs

45:21.740 --> 45:23.740
If only I could get those crunchins but I can't

45:23.740 --> 45:25.740
Just want to get some

45:25.740 --> 45:27.740
Crunchins have been vegan this whole time

45:27.740 --> 45:29.740
I bet

45:29.740 --> 45:31.740
How many of you hear this news and like

45:31.740 --> 45:33.740
Before we even finished talking about it

45:33.740 --> 45:35.740
There was just like a U-shaped puff of dust

45:35.740 --> 45:37.740
As you ran to your car

45:37.740 --> 45:39.740
A U-shaped puff of dust

45:39.740 --> 45:41.740
As you ran to your car and then turned back around

45:41.740 --> 45:43.740
And ran the other way away from your car

45:43.740 --> 45:45.740
Creating the U

45:45.740 --> 45:47.740
That is the U-shaped puff of dust that you have left

45:47.740 --> 45:49.740
Oh yeah they're committed

45:49.740 --> 45:51.740
They're in five restaurants

45:51.740 --> 45:53.740
Yeah

45:53.740 --> 45:55.740
Five different Long John Silvers

45:55.740 --> 45:57.740
Have these

45:57.740 --> 45:59.740
They're in California

45:59.740 --> 46:01.740
So they're bringing the seafood

46:01.740 --> 46:03.740
And coastal experience to California

46:03.740 --> 46:05.740
Thank god

46:05.740 --> 46:07.740
Give me that bean fish in the bread basket

46:07.740 --> 46:09.740
You know what I mean?

46:09.740 --> 46:11.740
Like where we need it

46:11.740 --> 46:13.740
I would

46:13.740 --> 46:15.740
And I'm not saying that this is true of everyone

46:15.740 --> 46:17.740
But there's someone in

46:17.740 --> 46:19.740
The bread basket, I say this living in Ohio

46:19.740 --> 46:21.740
That would walk up to the counter and say like

46:21.740 --> 46:23.740
I'll have the crab cakes and they'd be like

46:23.740 --> 46:25.740
Do you want that or not?

46:25.740 --> 46:27.740
And they'd be like what the fuck are you talking about?

46:27.740 --> 46:29.740
I just want to see that play out

46:29.740 --> 46:31.740
I just said crab cakes

46:31.740 --> 46:33.740
What about crab free cakes?

46:33.740 --> 46:35.740
I said I want the crab cakes

46:35.740 --> 46:37.740
Yeah but with or without the crab

46:37.740 --> 46:39.740
Fuck off!

46:39.740 --> 46:41.740
You know what makes me so mad about this?

46:41.740 --> 46:43.740
This fucking stupid segment

46:43.740 --> 46:45.740
I would fucking

46:45.740 --> 46:47.740
Annihilate some plant based chicken

46:47.740 --> 46:49.740
Fish nuggets right now

46:49.740 --> 46:51.740
I would annihilate them, so hungry for it now

46:51.740 --> 46:53.740
Thinking about that great white fish texture

46:53.740 --> 46:55.740
We love that

46:55.740 --> 46:57.740
I love that here

46:57.740 --> 46:59.740
Flaky

46:59.740 --> 47:01.740
My partner and I have a habit of stealing interesting coffee mugs

47:01.740 --> 47:03.740
Especially from people we dislike

47:03.740 --> 47:05.740
Our crown jewel is a church mug

47:05.740 --> 47:07.740
We stole from a landlord

47:07.740 --> 47:09.740
Who took our deposit unnecessarily

47:09.740 --> 47:11.740
A friend recently asked how we got so many weird mugs

47:11.740 --> 47:13.740
How do we explain

47:13.740 --> 47:15.740
Without seeming like petty kleptomaniacs

47:15.740 --> 47:17.740
This is from mysterious

47:17.740 --> 47:19.740
Mug mafiosos in Maryland

47:19.740 --> 47:21.740
And I have bad news

47:21.740 --> 47:23.740
You steal all the time

47:23.740 --> 47:25.740
You steal all the time

47:25.740 --> 47:27.740
For not great reasons

47:27.740 --> 47:29.740
Yeah

47:29.740 --> 47:31.740
Yeah

47:31.740 --> 47:33.740
They got you

47:33.740 --> 47:35.740
I think this is

47:35.740 --> 47:37.740
If you can't stand in your truth

47:37.740 --> 47:39.740
For this

47:39.740 --> 47:41.740
And be like oh we stole these

47:41.740 --> 47:43.740
Because it's funny

47:43.740 --> 47:45.740
These are stolen

47:45.740 --> 47:47.740
It gives us a little modicum of control back

47:47.740 --> 47:49.740
Right

47:49.740 --> 47:51.740
They took something from us so we took something from them

47:51.740 --> 47:53.740
We know it's not great

47:53.740 --> 47:55.740
But it's a thing the two of us do together

47:55.740 --> 47:57.740
And we like

47:57.740 --> 47:59.740
We like it

47:59.740 --> 48:01.740
It doesn't hurt anybody except the person who we've stolen from

48:01.740 --> 48:03.740
Are you guys at this point

48:03.740 --> 48:05.740
With your mugs where it is a one in one out policy

48:05.740 --> 48:07.740
It's had to become that

48:07.740 --> 48:09.740
Yes

48:09.740 --> 48:11.740
It's become that at our house

48:11.740 --> 48:13.740
We have now two drawers

48:13.740 --> 48:15.740
Filled with coffee mugs

48:15.740 --> 48:17.740
We have a good drawer

48:17.740 --> 48:19.740
And a bad drawer

48:19.740 --> 48:21.740
A bad drawer of mugs we don't like

48:21.740 --> 48:23.740
But can't get rid of

48:23.740 --> 48:25.740
And then the good drawer of the mugs

48:25.740 --> 48:27.740
This is what I was going to say

48:27.740 --> 48:29.740
Because I

48:29.740 --> 48:31.740
God help me

48:31.740 --> 48:33.740
I have two shelves in a cabinet

48:33.740 --> 48:35.740
And one shelf is full of mugs we use

48:35.740 --> 48:37.740
And the other one are

48:37.740 --> 48:39.740
Just in case mugs I get

48:39.740 --> 48:41.740
Like in case I open a coffee shop

48:41.740 --> 48:43.740
Suddenly

48:43.740 --> 48:45.740
They're like

48:45.740 --> 48:47.740
I suddenly had that corporate retreat

48:47.740 --> 48:49.740
In my house

48:49.740 --> 48:51.740
I got 40 people here from the local bank

48:51.740 --> 48:53.740
Who decided to have a trust building exercise

48:53.740 --> 48:55.740
In my living room

48:55.740 --> 48:57.740
And I have to provide cappuccinos for everybody

48:57.740 --> 48:59.740
Here's my thing also

48:59.740 --> 49:01.740
These aren't even mugs I use

49:01.740 --> 49:03.740
I haven't used a regular coffee mug for 10 years

49:03.740 --> 49:05.740
I have two mugs that I use

49:05.740 --> 49:07.740
On alternating days

49:07.740 --> 49:09.740
I only use travel mugs

49:09.740 --> 49:11.740
Even though I work out of the house

49:11.740 --> 49:13.740
I only use travel mugs

49:13.740 --> 49:15.740
And that way my coffee stays hot and fresh

49:15.740 --> 49:17.740
All day long

49:17.740 --> 49:19.740
But then you have no rush to drink it

49:19.740 --> 49:21.740
Do you do the same damn thing Griffin?

49:21.740 --> 49:23.740
I love when it gets to be 2pm and I'm like

49:23.740 --> 49:25.740
Hot coffee

49:25.740 --> 49:27.740
It's still hot and good

49:27.740 --> 49:29.740
I'm drinking one right now

49:29.740 --> 49:31.740
Contigo Autoseal

49:31.740 --> 49:33.740
Cheers

49:33.740 --> 49:35.740
He hit the microphone with his cup

49:35.740 --> 49:37.740
Oh boy

49:37.740 --> 49:39.740
I just have a big mug with West Virginia on it

49:39.740 --> 49:41.740
It looks like

49:41.740 --> 49:43.740
And I am wearing overalls right now

49:43.740 --> 49:45.740
I feel like a school art teacher

49:45.740 --> 49:47.740
With this big mug

49:47.740 --> 49:49.740
And it's kind of spotty and you feel like stoneware

49:49.740 --> 49:51.740
I love it

49:51.740 --> 49:53.740
Contigo Autoseal

49:53.740 --> 49:55.740
Is it stoneware?

49:55.740 --> 49:57.740
The Contigo Autoseal

49:57.740 --> 49:59.740
Has a valve

49:59.740 --> 50:01.740
That you press a button

50:01.740 --> 50:03.740
That allows the free flow of coffee

50:03.740 --> 50:05.740
This valve is spring loaded

50:05.740 --> 50:07.740
This valve

50:07.740 --> 50:09.740
This little release on the lid

50:09.740 --> 50:11.740
Will flip up

50:11.740 --> 50:13.740
So you can clean underneath it

50:13.740 --> 50:15.740
I discovered this

50:15.740 --> 50:17.740
Far too recently

50:17.740 --> 50:19.740
Oh no

50:19.740 --> 50:21.740
Why does the mug smell like that?

50:21.740 --> 50:23.740
You had baked in coffee goodness

50:23.740 --> 50:25.740
Why do you have wretched mugs?

50:25.740 --> 50:27.740
I like the open mug

50:27.740 --> 50:29.740
With no lid or

50:29.740 --> 50:31.740
Thermal properties

50:31.740 --> 50:33.740
Because then it encourages me to drain it

50:33.740 --> 50:35.740
To drain it

50:35.740 --> 50:37.740
I love that

50:37.740 --> 50:39.740
My mug is

50:39.740 --> 50:41.740
The brand of it is Zach

50:41.740 --> 50:43.740
Oh I love Zach stuff

50:43.740 --> 50:45.740
I have a big Zach cup that I use for all my

50:45.740 --> 50:47.740
Iced beverages

50:47.740 --> 50:49.740
But it's weird because it looks like

50:49.740 --> 50:51.740
It's like

50:51.740 --> 50:53.740
Not mine

50:53.740 --> 50:55.740
It's like hey Zach

50:55.740 --> 50:57.740
And I'm like damn it

50:57.740 --> 50:59.740
Can I still drink it though?

50:59.740 --> 51:01.740
I feel like we gave dad too hard a time

51:01.740 --> 51:03.740
For talking so much about drinkware when we were kids

51:03.740 --> 51:05.740
We didn't know how good we had it

51:05.740 --> 51:07.740
To learn about drinkware from a man

51:07.740 --> 51:09.740
Like a real man

51:09.740 --> 51:11.740
Who drank all kinds of different things

51:11.740 --> 51:13.740
Out of lots of different cups

51:13.740 --> 51:15.740
He would talk to us about Tervis and we'd just kind of ignore him

51:15.740 --> 51:17.740
And now I'm like won't someone talk to me about Tervis

51:17.740 --> 51:19.740
Yeah I would love to

51:19.740 --> 51:21.740
Hey I was sent a mug

51:21.740 --> 51:23.740
By a fan

51:23.740 --> 51:25.740
That had like a panther on it

51:25.740 --> 51:27.740
And it said in big black letters

51:27.740 --> 51:29.740
Be nice to me

51:29.740 --> 51:31.740
I have diarrhea on it

51:31.740 --> 51:33.740
And then

51:33.740 --> 51:35.740
I would say

51:35.740 --> 51:37.740
Six weeks later

51:37.740 --> 51:39.740
I was sent

51:39.740 --> 51:41.740
A mug by a fan

51:41.740 --> 51:43.740
That also had a panther on it

51:43.740 --> 51:45.740
That said be nice to me I have diarrhea

51:45.740 --> 51:47.740
On it and it was the same

51:47.740 --> 51:49.740
Mug and so two different people

51:49.740 --> 51:51.740
Saw that

51:51.740 --> 51:53.740
And said that reminds me of Griffin

51:53.740 --> 51:55.740
So much I'm going to spend

51:55.740 --> 51:57.740
You know $19.99 plus shipping

51:57.740 --> 51:59.740
Or whatever to make sure

51:59.740 --> 52:01.740
He has it so I do have two of those on it

52:01.740 --> 52:03.740
Sometimes you only know one thing

52:03.740 --> 52:05.740
About a person and it's like oh they love

52:05.740 --> 52:07.740
Unicorns or whatever so you get them

52:07.740 --> 52:09.740
The one thing people know about Griffin

52:09.740 --> 52:11.740
Is he gets diarrhea a lot

52:11.740 --> 52:13.740
Not a lot I haven't had it in a long time

52:13.740 --> 52:15.740
In fact Travis I know for a fact you've had

52:15.740 --> 52:17.740
Diarrhea more recently than me

52:17.740 --> 52:19.740
Yes but not as often statistically speaking

52:19.740 --> 52:21.740
Days out of our lives spent with

52:21.740 --> 52:23.740
Diarrhea

52:23.740 --> 52:25.740
In 2021 I haven't had it

52:25.740 --> 52:27.740
At all

52:27.740 --> 52:29.740
That's because you haven't been exposed

52:29.740 --> 52:31.740
To the harsh spores

52:31.740 --> 52:33.740
Of the world

52:33.740 --> 52:35.740
And this is the truth isn't it

52:35.740 --> 52:37.740
It's not my fault

52:37.740 --> 52:39.740
It's the world Griffin doesn't have diarrhea

52:39.740 --> 52:41.740
The world has diarrhea

52:41.740 --> 52:43.740
It gives it to me when I'm not

52:43.740 --> 52:45.740
I got a mask up Fauci's like it's cool

52:45.740 --> 52:47.740
Or is it it's not and I'm like I don't care

52:47.740 --> 52:49.740
I'm going to do it because the world's got diarrhea

52:49.740 --> 52:51.740
But if you stay in your

52:51.740 --> 52:53.740
World's got diarrhea

52:53.740 --> 52:55.740
As long as you stay in your

52:55.740 --> 52:57.740
Hormetically sealed home

52:57.740 --> 52:59.740
No diarrhea can get to you

52:59.740 --> 53:01.740
Exactly and also no chicken wings

53:01.740 --> 53:03.740
No chicken wings

53:03.740 --> 53:05.740
Guys I still I'm really like everything

53:05.740 --> 53:07.740
We've said after finding out the chicken

53:07.740 --> 53:09.740
Sandwich wars are over like I've got

53:09.740 --> 53:11.740
Two sons

53:11.740 --> 53:13.740
And knowing that they're not going to be drafted

53:13.740 --> 53:15.740
They're not going to be conscripted

53:15.740 --> 53:17.740
You know what I mean

53:17.740 --> 53:19.740
They're not going to have to go overseas

53:19.740 --> 53:21.740
It means the world to me

53:23.740 --> 53:25.740
Yeah but now they're going to have to

53:25.740 --> 53:27.740
They'll have to take up arms

53:27.740 --> 53:29.740
In the plant based seafood wars

53:29.740 --> 53:31.740
It's going to be a lot chiller though

53:31.740 --> 53:33.740
That's going to be a lot of mostly like

53:33.740 --> 53:35.740
Like there's going to be a lot of

53:35.740 --> 53:37.740
Computer warfare there there's a lot

53:37.740 --> 53:39.740
Yeah a lot of cyber one yeah exactly

53:39.740 --> 53:41.740
At the end

53:41.740 --> 53:43.740
This restaurant is by the way it said

53:43.740 --> 53:45.740
And with the plant based seafood industry

53:45.740 --> 53:47.740
Expected to grow to a staggering

53:47.740 --> 53:49.740
1.3 billion

53:49.740 --> 53:51.740
In the next 10 years Long John Silver's

53:51.740 --> 53:53.740
And Good Catch are the leading edge of a long term

53:53.740 --> 53:55.740
Movement I you know what I gotta

53:55.740 --> 53:57.740
Say if you're going to open up five restaurants

53:57.740 --> 53:59.740
I don't know if we're going to get there

53:59.740 --> 54:01.740
If Long John Silver's only has five

54:01.740 --> 54:03.740
Throw your fucking hat over the ring

54:03.740 --> 54:05.740
Launch it in every restaurant

54:05.740 --> 54:07.740
Even ones you don't own

54:07.740 --> 54:09.740
Make a little kiosk

54:09.740 --> 54:11.740
Where they can get it

54:11.740 --> 54:13.740
My favorite fish place is this little

54:13.740 --> 54:15.740
Hole in the wall called

54:15.740 --> 54:17.740
Oxide Charlie's

54:17.740 --> 54:19.740
In West Virginia you mean

54:19.740 --> 54:21.740
Inside an O Charlie's

54:21.740 --> 54:23.740
Oh boy

54:23.740 --> 54:25.740
It's hey if you want the real catch

54:25.740 --> 54:27.740
You know what I mean

54:27.740 --> 54:29.740
The real catch

54:29.740 --> 54:31.740
Is it like a VIP lounge inside

54:31.740 --> 54:33.740
How do you get into it

54:33.740 --> 54:35.740
Yeah it's just

54:35.740 --> 54:37.740
It's a kitchen bun

54:37.740 --> 54:39.740

54:59.740 --> 55:01.740

55:01.740 --> 55:03.740
For individuals and businesses to give back to the environment

55:03.740 --> 55:05.740
Create a healthier climate

Plus you'll get a pin that says work of fart

55:11.740 --> 55:13.740
On it

My Life Is Better With You

56:41.740 --> 56:43.740
It's close, it's close

56:43.740 --> 56:45.740
It's all I can say

56:45.740 --> 56:47.740
I thought you were saying I was close to getting the name of the song right

56:47.740 --> 56:49.740
No, no, no, it's close

56:49.740 --> 56:51.740
It's coming

56:51.740 --> 56:53.740
The shadow of it has been cast

56:53.740 --> 56:55.740
Over all the major metropolitan areas

56:55.740 --> 56:57.740
Of the country

56:57.740 --> 56:59.740
And that's all we're going to say about it

56:59.740 --> 57:01.740
Y'all want to find a yahoo?

57:01.740 --> 57:03.740
Yeah

57:03.740 --> 57:05.740
Yeah, this one was sent in by Ricky

57:05.740 --> 57:09.740
It says here Thick Ricky sent this one in

57:09.740 --> 57:11.740
Thanks Thick Ricky

57:11.740 --> 57:13.740
Yeah, and it's asked by yahoo answers user

57:13.740 --> 57:15.740
It's asked by yahoo answers user

57:15.740 --> 57:17.740
Papa John

57:17.740 --> 57:19.740
It says Papa John

57:19.740 --> 57:21.740
It says Papa John

57:21.740 --> 57:23.740
You're sure about that?

57:23.740 --> 57:25.740
Yeah, it says Papa John

57:25.740 --> 57:27.740
It's weird

57:27.740 --> 57:29.740
Papa John Schlatter asked this

57:29.740 --> 57:31.740
And he said

57:31.740 --> 57:33.740
