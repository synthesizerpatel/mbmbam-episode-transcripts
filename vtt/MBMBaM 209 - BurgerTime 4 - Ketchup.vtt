00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:49.120
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Mean Advice Show for the modern era.

00:49.120 --> 00:54.400
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:54.400 --> 01:04.080
And I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Ooh, ooh, ooh, have an Anna? Have ooh, ooh, ooh.

01:04.080 --> 01:08.480
Amy, pretty, smart, smart. Gorilla, gorilla, gorilla.

01:09.680 --> 01:12.240
Ladies and gentlemen, it's certainly become clear to you by now.

01:13.920 --> 01:21.200
We have Dawn of the Planet of the Apes of the Fever. Yeah, we're crazy for it. New picture

01:21.200 --> 01:29.440
coming out this week. Got Andy Serkis as Caesar, of course, doing that mocap. Jason Clarke is here.

01:30.240 --> 01:36.160
Keri Russell, Felicity, and monkeys in one movie. Thank you very much. Halfway through the movie

01:36.160 --> 01:42.240
is the monkey cut her hair. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. I do have to, and I hope this isn't

01:42.240 --> 01:49.200
sacrilege because we do all have monkey fever. How whack does your movie have to be before

01:49.200 --> 01:56.800
James Franco is like, sorry, I can't do that, and also I was in Spring Breakers. Like, I can't get

01:56.800 --> 02:02.720
there with you for a sequel. We can't do this together. You want me to act with virtual monkeys?

02:02.720 --> 02:08.640
No thank you. I'm going to go kick it with Vanessa Hudgens. No thank you. A virtual Vanessa Hudgens.

02:08.640 --> 02:14.800
Virtual Vanessa Hudgens in Spring Breakers? It's just, it's a man, it's a gaffer with a big bushy

02:14.800 --> 02:19.120
beard, and he's holding a tennis ball, and he's saying, Franco, look at the tennis ball and pretend

02:19.120 --> 02:21.920
it is Vanessa Hudgens. Now touch it with your nose and get a treat. Touch it with your face.

02:22.560 --> 02:26.320
It's Vanessa Hudgens face, and when you see this tennis ball, hold on, let me get my Sharpie up.

02:27.600 --> 02:32.800
Okay, I've drawn a face on this. Okay, he's not doing it. He's distracted. Hold on one second.

02:32.800 --> 02:38.160
Let me smear a little peanut butter on the tennis ball. Go, Franco, go. Yummy.

02:38.160 --> 02:45.920
Um, I gotta admit, I'm more, I have, I'm more excited about another film. I've got boyhood fever.

02:45.920 --> 02:50.640
Okay. Like Scarlet fever? I would not go around loudly proclaiming that you have boyhood fever.

02:50.640 --> 02:58.080
I have boyhood fever! It's a new Linklater film. It's a bold filmmaking experiment. It shows a boy,

02:58.640 --> 03:04.720
and they filmed him for like 11 or 13 years or something, until he became basically a man.

03:04.720 --> 03:08.400
Griffin, uh, when you loudly proclaimed that you had boyhood fever,

03:08.400 --> 03:11.520
did you instantly grow a perfectly coiffed mustache?

03:14.640 --> 03:18.160
Where is this tucked in, tucked in button-down shirt coming from?

03:18.160 --> 03:19.680
You can laugh if you want.

03:19.680 --> 03:22.720
If you hadn't heard of this movie, which I had until last night, apparently they shot,

03:23.440 --> 03:28.240
uh, it over 12 years, so you see a boy becoming a man.

03:28.240 --> 03:29.840
I just said that.

03:29.840 --> 03:33.680
In many ways, this podcast is our boyhood.

03:33.680 --> 03:40.560
It's our boyhood, sure. No, I was, I was, but low onto a child when, when we started this thing.

03:40.560 --> 03:44.400
I was 22 fucking years old. Can you imagine anybody that young, ever?

03:45.040 --> 03:46.480
Nobody's ever been that young.

03:46.480 --> 03:49.360
And when you were a child, you goofed like a child,

03:49.360 --> 03:52.000
but now as a man, you've put away such childish goofs.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.440
The one, the only time I felt that young, I think, in recent memory,

03:57.440 --> 04:01.040
is when I was sitting in the theater for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,

04:01.040 --> 04:06.560
and I saw all my favorite characters, all the classic monkeys returning for another, uh,

04:06.560 --> 04:07.600
Chim Chim,

04:07.600 --> 04:10.000
Caesar, uh,

04:10.000 --> 04:10.880
The Monkey King,

04:11.600 --> 04:12.560
Grondo,

04:12.560 --> 04:13.360
The Strong One,

04:13.920 --> 04:14.240
Gronk,

04:14.240 --> 04:14.880
Gordito,

04:16.080 --> 04:16.560
Beaver,

04:17.760 --> 04:18.400
Bumblebee,

04:19.200 --> 04:20.240
Optimus Primal,

04:24.400 --> 04:27.680
Banana Boy, Banana Boy with an I, and that's not a monkey.

04:27.680 --> 04:30.240
That's like a man, that was like a man that they kept around.

04:30.240 --> 04:31.120
Gorilla Grodd.

04:32.000 --> 04:32.960
I can't wait.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.760
This movie's been getting great reviews.

04:36.480 --> 04:39.760
It's 91% fresh, and that doesn't even need any more debate.

04:40.640 --> 04:44.320
If you haven't seen a movie in a while, and you've been looking for an opportunity,

04:44.320 --> 04:46.080
I don't even think you need to see the last one.

04:46.080 --> 04:47.760
You'll go ape for it.

04:47.760 --> 04:50.000
You'll go ape for it. You will, Travis.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.840
That's funny because, um, uh, in the title, the monkeys.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.160
I want to go-

04:58.160 --> 05:01.680
Please don't email us, like, telling us the difference.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.000
Do we fucking get it? That's the fucking joke.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.080
That's the fucking joke.

05:06.080 --> 05:07.520
Do we need to take you to fucking-

05:07.520 --> 05:10.160
We need to give you a fucking comedy clinic right now?

05:10.160 --> 05:11.280
You piece of trash.

05:11.840 --> 05:13.120
That's the fucking-

05:13.120 --> 05:15.840
Wow, we really turned on a dime there.

05:15.840 --> 05:17.680
About my science books and-

05:17.680 --> 05:19.360
Fuck you, that's the fucking-

05:19.360 --> 05:20.160
Do you think-

05:20.160 --> 05:20.880
Just go ahead-

05:20.880 --> 05:22.240
I love it when people are just like,

05:22.240 --> 05:24.480
Oh, I don't know if they're being serious or not,

05:24.480 --> 05:26.960
so let's just assume the shittiest thing about them.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.400
There's a fucking joke.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.000
And you know what?

05:30.000 --> 05:32.320
Let me give you a little secret about your science book.

05:32.320 --> 05:35.360
You know, people want to throw science books in our face all the time, constantly.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.080
Duck, you know, here comes another one.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.360
But here's the thing about that.

05:39.360 --> 05:41.760
That's going to be outdated in five years.

05:41.760 --> 05:43.760
It'll all be like, remember that last book?

05:43.760 --> 05:44.560
It was bullshit.

05:44.560 --> 05:45.680
We were lying about all of it.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.760
Here's the new shit, but this is really real.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.120
Apes and monkeys are the same thing.

05:49.120 --> 05:49.760
Look at the apes.

05:49.760 --> 05:50.240
They're just-

05:50.240 --> 05:51.120
They're bigger.

05:51.120 --> 05:53.840
And if we evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?

05:53.840 --> 05:54.240
You know?

05:54.240 --> 05:55.360
Uh oh.

05:55.360 --> 05:58.640
Come on, science.

05:58.640 --> 06:01.360
We are disassembling science one step at a time,

06:01.360 --> 06:03.760
but we're helping you to rebuild your life.

06:03.760 --> 06:06.400
We'll check back in at the end to knock down some more science.

06:06.400 --> 06:09.680
I promise you that all our advice will not be

06:09.680 --> 06:13.040
go see Dawn of the Planet of the Apes in theaters this weekend.

06:13.040 --> 06:13.680
Which one is it?

06:14.720 --> 06:17.440
Rise is the first one, but I think that's confusing to me, right?

06:17.440 --> 06:19.920
Because Rise of the Planet of the Apes, it's not.

06:19.920 --> 06:22.240
And Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is not the same.

06:22.240 --> 06:23.680
It should have been Dawn first.

06:23.680 --> 06:25.120
That's what always confuses me.

06:25.120 --> 06:28.240
You can't rise before the dawn.

06:28.240 --> 06:29.680
It's Dawn and then Rise.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.840
Why wasn't Dawn first and then Rise?

06:31.840 --> 06:33.200
It makes me very angry.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.920
I love these movies and I love this franchise.

06:35.920 --> 06:38.320
And this is the only thing wrong with it so far.

06:38.960 --> 06:41.040
This is the only thing they've fucked up so far.

06:41.040 --> 06:44.400
The rest of the movie is like the best movie ever, basically.

06:44.400 --> 06:45.280
Yeah, that-

06:45.280 --> 06:47.440
Yeah, the only thing I don't like about it.

06:47.440 --> 06:50.560
It's like if they made a sequel to Boyhood and called it Baby.

06:50.560 --> 06:55.120
Babykins, a Richard Linklater film.

06:55.120 --> 06:55.840
Baby Genius.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.240
Did you see the geniuses?

06:58.240 --> 07:01.360
Did you see the new Richard Linklater Baby Geniuses?

07:01.920 --> 07:06.160
It's just two Baby Geniuses walking through the streets of Versailles.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.320
And one of them's dying and they're just talking about-

07:08.320 --> 07:12.160
One of them's dying and they're talking about the nature of life and death.

07:12.160 --> 07:16.880
And then they'll take a break and someone will write them a poem below the Arc de Triomphe.

07:16.880 --> 07:19.840
And also Ethan Hawke is there.

07:20.480 --> 07:22.080
I really want to see this movie now.

07:22.080 --> 07:23.840
Man, it was a fucking good movie.

07:23.840 --> 07:25.680
There was no Baby Geniuses 3.

07:26.240 --> 07:29.200
There was Super Babies Baby Geniuses 2.

07:29.200 --> 07:32.160
And that's the one where they had a little person

07:32.880 --> 07:36.400
with a baby's face superimposed over their head as they danced.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.840
I did not enjoy that scene.

07:38.560 --> 07:39.920
That was a troubling scene.

07:39.920 --> 07:44.960
But this is a troubling podcast and we're going to try to untrouble you.

07:44.960 --> 07:47.360
We have time for one and a half questions now.

07:47.360 --> 07:49.360
All right, let's spin it up.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.960
In a moment of weakness and lacking insight from the brothers wise,

07:52.960 --> 07:55.280
I agreed to let my nephew move into my basement.

07:55.280 --> 07:56.080
He's in a band.

07:56.640 --> 08:00.960
He pays no rent, eats all our food, leaves messes, and generally acts like a 14 year old.

08:01.520 --> 08:04.000
How can I get him to pack up his bags and move away?

08:04.000 --> 08:06.640
That's from Carl the Grumpy Old Man in Lincoln, Nebraska.

08:07.760 --> 08:09.200
Is he 14 years old?

08:09.920 --> 08:11.040
That's a really good question.

08:11.040 --> 08:12.560
I don't understand how all this lines up.

08:12.560 --> 08:18.800
Okay, there's a if he's 32, this is a much different question than if he's like 19.

08:18.800 --> 08:23.920
You know, it's so rare that you get to do something nice for somebody like this.

08:24.640 --> 08:28.400
You could, I could connive a few ways for you to get rid of them.

08:28.400 --> 08:33.520
You know, like, I mean, there's fake ghosts, fake haunting, the basis on it.

08:33.520 --> 08:34.000
That's easy.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.960
You could gaslight them.

08:36.960 --> 08:37.840
Gaslight them.

08:37.840 --> 08:41.760
That's just every day remove one article of something from their room.

08:41.760 --> 08:46.000
Something from their room and put it like in storage or move it to an apartment.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.880
This is going to be a really long term plan, but like just one sock, you know, on Monday

08:50.880 --> 08:55.680
and then like a CD on Tuesday and just slowly move them out of the house.

08:56.480 --> 09:01.840
Can you start an even louder band on the top floor?

09:01.840 --> 09:02.480
Do you know what I mean?

09:02.480 --> 09:09.440
Like if he's rocking all day and night on his his strat, then maybe you buy an even

09:09.440 --> 09:13.360
bigger Marshall stack, point that towards the ground and just start like laying down

09:13.360 --> 09:16.000
some like kidney stone rattling bass riffs.

09:16.000 --> 09:16.800
Oh, I love this.

09:16.800 --> 09:21.280
And if whatever their band is called, you call your band that, but bigger.

09:21.280 --> 09:21.440
Right.

09:21.440 --> 09:25.440
So if his band is perfect death, it was like, we're a perfecter death.

09:26.000 --> 09:26.720
Er.

09:26.720 --> 09:27.220
Er.

09:28.880 --> 09:29.920
More perfect death.

09:30.560 --> 09:32.640
And then you get incredibly popular.

09:32.640 --> 09:36.320
You buy him his own house behind your house.

09:36.320 --> 09:38.560
You're going to have to entourage this shit.

09:38.560 --> 09:42.640
Why would you want it if you went to all the trouble of buying him another house?

09:42.640 --> 09:46.080
You don't have enough money to buy another plot of land, so you can only build him a

09:46.080 --> 09:47.680
small dollhouse in your place.

09:47.680 --> 09:48.480
You still love him.

09:48.480 --> 09:49.760
You don't want to be you love him.

09:49.760 --> 09:51.040
You don't want to be too far away.

09:51.040 --> 09:55.360
But you will have you will have a witch cast a spell on him to make him little enough to

09:55.360 --> 09:56.480
live in a dollhouse.

09:56.480 --> 10:00.240
Basically, this is this is called the candor is what is that we have.

10:00.240 --> 10:03.040
You put him in a bottle city that you keep in your den.

10:03.040 --> 10:06.320
Why have you not told him to stop being a dipshit?

10:06.320 --> 10:11.920
Yeah, I mean, life has to tell you that you know the guy who owns your house gets to tell

10:11.920 --> 10:16.640
you that I'm pretty sure like our dad always told us when we were being idiots.

10:16.640 --> 10:19.120
You're his dad now because you own his you own the house.

10:19.120 --> 10:19.600
Correct.

10:20.160 --> 10:26.240
You're like any sitcom in which like a non direct family member or friend moves in.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.760
You you now are responsible for them like a parent.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.680
That's what the Matthews did for Corey.

10:31.680 --> 10:32.640
Sorry, Sean.

10:32.640 --> 10:33.920
Corey was their son.

10:33.920 --> 10:36.640
Or like in in step by step.

10:36.640 --> 10:38.720
I believe it was Cody and then Flash.

10:38.720 --> 10:41.280
You got to treat them like you're your child.

10:41.280 --> 10:42.560
Fresh Prince of Bel-Air him.

10:42.560 --> 10:43.120
There you go.

10:43.120 --> 10:46.720
You've got you're the uncle Phil to his Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.

10:46.720 --> 10:48.880
You got to uncle Phil him with your love.

10:48.880 --> 10:50.320
But you kind of want to help him grow.

10:50.320 --> 10:52.720
Sounds sounds to me like you want to DJ Jazzy Jeff.

10:54.960 --> 10:55.680
That's what you okay.

10:55.680 --> 10:58.880
This is the conversation you sit down saying you need to make a decision right now.

10:58.880 --> 11:00.800
Are you going to be my Fresh Prince of Bel-Air?

11:00.800 --> 11:02.800
Are you going to be my DJ Jazzy Jeff?

11:02.800 --> 11:05.360
I'm I kind of he doesn't get the reference out.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.160
He goes out.

11:06.160 --> 11:06.560
He goes.

11:06.560 --> 11:07.680
He's obviously a Jeff.

11:07.680 --> 11:08.880
This is what I'm saying.

11:08.880 --> 11:11.600
It is Will Smith.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.440
The I said Fresh Will.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.040
Was his name just Will in the show?

11:15.040 --> 11:15.600
Yes.

11:16.160 --> 11:17.360
That's some bullshit.

11:17.360 --> 11:17.760
He couldn't.

11:17.760 --> 11:18.640
It was Will.

11:18.640 --> 11:20.080
It was William.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.200
William Enium.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.000
That was his name.

11:23.680 --> 11:27.440
William Enium represented a pretty tremendous.

11:27.440 --> 11:28.400
You go back and watch that show.

11:28.400 --> 11:32.560
Pretty tremendous amount of character growth throughout the run of

11:32.560 --> 11:33.200
Fresh Prince.

11:33.200 --> 11:36.960
DJ Jazzy Jeff was was almost belligerently stagnant.

11:36.960 --> 11:40.720
Well, to be fair, he was thrown on his head several times, right?

11:41.280 --> 11:44.080
So I mean, I there definitely is a physiological element to it.

11:44.080 --> 11:46.480
I'm just saying that DJ Jazzy Jeff.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.480
By the end of the series finale, like we're going to go to college now.

11:52.480 --> 11:55.280
And he was like, I just want to party all night long.

11:55.280 --> 11:59.040
And then he puts online where she's all night long because he's like fucking stuck.

11:59.040 --> 11:59.760
You know what I mean?

11:59.760 --> 12:00.160
Right?

12:00.160 --> 12:00.480
Yes.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.080
Now he has no opportunity.

12:02.080 --> 12:03.520
He has nothing.

12:03.520 --> 12:08.320
Also, did he ever DJ on that show fucking once ever?

12:09.360 --> 12:10.160
I don't ever.

12:10.160 --> 12:11.040
I don't think so.

12:11.040 --> 12:11.840
I believe he did.

12:13.120 --> 12:17.120
There is a an episode in which will rent out the house for our music video.

12:17.120 --> 12:22.800
And I believe DJ Jazzy Jeff sneaks in and he's doing a little mixing on the old ones and twos.

12:22.800 --> 12:23.760
That's fun.

12:23.760 --> 12:24.560
And that's a fun.

12:24.560 --> 12:25.520
That's a fun episode.

12:25.520 --> 12:29.840
How how frustrating must it be to be a genuine like actual musical artist,

12:29.840 --> 12:35.200
but for a generation of white people, you are that guy that got thrown out of the house.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.480
Like, no, I had like a whole career before this.

12:38.480 --> 12:39.680
You go, oh, god damn it.

12:40.720 --> 12:45.920
And before we get right in, I just remembered that I believe it was not will that rented out

12:45.920 --> 12:46.240
the house.

12:46.240 --> 12:47.920
He was trying to stop it from happening.

12:47.920 --> 12:49.920
In fact, Carlton rented out the house.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.680
That seems not like Carlton.

12:53.280 --> 12:54.240
Was that the same episode?

12:54.240 --> 12:56.320
Was that the same episode where Carlton bought a gun?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.040
That was a real good one.

12:59.040 --> 13:03.840
That was Carlton's like breaking bad the entire series in one episode for him.

13:03.840 --> 13:08.480
The best episode, I think, is the one where will has to convince Carlton that racism exists.

13:09.120 --> 13:09.840
Did you guys ever?

13:09.840 --> 13:10.960
I do remember that.

13:10.960 --> 13:15.840
Yeah, he was driving slowly and he got pulled over and he thought it's because he was driving

13:15.840 --> 13:17.040
so slowly.

13:17.040 --> 13:20.640
And Wilson was like, no, racism exists.

13:20.640 --> 13:25.520
And it blows Carlton's mind because he's never experienced it before in his life.

13:25.520 --> 13:27.440
No, that's like a it's not like a fun.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.840
And that's not like a laugh a minute episode.

13:30.560 --> 13:31.920
It goes like really hard.

13:31.920 --> 13:33.040
It's actually hard.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.560
They go fucking hard on that show.

13:34.560 --> 13:35.200
We give that show.

13:35.200 --> 13:36.640
I'm just saying that we do.

13:37.200 --> 13:41.040
We goof about that show because it's called Fresh Prince of Bel Air and there's a character

13:41.040 --> 13:43.280
on it called DJ Jazzy Jeff.

13:43.280 --> 13:46.720
They tackle some fucking heady, heady subjects.

13:46.720 --> 13:50.400
There's an amazing episode in which will goes off about like his dad.

13:50.400 --> 13:51.040
Leave it.

13:51.600 --> 13:52.080
Oh, yeah.

13:52.080 --> 13:54.160
It'll rock you to your very core.

13:54.160 --> 13:54.400
Yeah.

13:54.800 --> 13:55.520
Y'all want to Yahoo?

13:55.520 --> 14:04.960
Yeah, this Yahoo was sent in by level 165 Yahoo Shaman Diamond member Drew Davenport.

14:04.960 --> 14:05.760
Thank you, Drew Davenport.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.040
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

14:07.040 --> 14:07.920
He needs a rebrand.

14:08.880 --> 14:09.920
Maybe double D.

14:09.920 --> 14:10.960
Maybe double D.

14:10.960 --> 14:12.720
Double D or the Drew.

14:12.720 --> 14:13.680
The Drew.

14:13.680 --> 14:14.000
Thank you.

14:14.000 --> 14:14.400
The Drew.

14:14.400 --> 14:22.320
It's by Yahoo Answers user The Walrus who asks how to lose weight in my nipples.

14:22.320 --> 14:31.200
I was fat and now I'm not fat, but my nipples are still fat and they are in quote, Hershey's

14:31.200 --> 14:32.080
kiss nipples.

14:34.720 --> 14:37.760
First of all, you need to rebrand because if you lost the weight, you shouldn't be

14:37.760 --> 14:39.120
going by The Walrus anymore.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.320
What are you doing to yourself?

14:40.880 --> 14:45.200
Well, no, now it's like now he changes up those expectations.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.000
Oh, I see.

14:46.000 --> 14:52.080
You hear The Walrus coming and out in walks a really svelte man with like huge nipples.

14:52.080 --> 14:54.080
Huge nipples you can see through his blouse.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.000
Crazy big nips.

14:56.640 --> 14:57.520
Huge nips.

14:57.520 --> 14:59.120
And we're not even talking about like-

14:59.120 --> 15:00.560
Wait, are we sure this is a man?

15:02.480 --> 15:03.600
I mean, The Walrus.

15:04.400 --> 15:04.720
Okay.

15:04.720 --> 15:05.280
Oh, okay.

15:05.280 --> 15:05.920
Wait, hold on.

15:06.560 --> 15:07.680
Walr I can also be.

15:09.120 --> 15:10.480
They have to reproduce.

15:11.360 --> 15:13.280
That's a good point Travis.

15:13.280 --> 15:13.520
Yeah.

15:13.520 --> 15:14.800
I guess you really undid me.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.640
You really unspooled my logic there.

15:16.640 --> 15:17.200
I think-

15:18.320 --> 15:20.880
Either way, I think we can talk about this in a gender.

15:20.880 --> 15:23.680
I mean, we can talk about anything in a gender neutral sense.

15:23.680 --> 15:25.280
I think you-

15:26.880 --> 15:31.520
Imagine like I'm having a hard time visualizing these nips.

15:31.520 --> 15:31.760
Okay.

15:31.760 --> 15:32.560
I'm not.

15:32.560 --> 15:35.520
And I'm usually super good at that.

15:35.520 --> 15:37.840
I've been practicing for this day since I was 12.

15:38.560 --> 15:39.760
What I'm saying is-

15:39.760 --> 15:42.720
Given the least amount of information, I get verbally bitched.

15:42.720 --> 15:47.120
I had a good decade long run of trying to imagine what nipples look like.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.200
So I am well acquainted.

15:49.200 --> 15:54.880
Are we talking about like plump tipples?

15:56.640 --> 15:58.400
They literally say Hershey Kisses.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.880
Imagine Hershey Kisses with bumps on them.

16:00.880 --> 16:04.240
So we're talking about pieces of paper sticking out the end.

16:04.240 --> 16:07.920
We're talking about areolas that are elevated somehow.

16:07.920 --> 16:09.840
They are topographical.

16:09.840 --> 16:10.640
They just don't quit.

16:12.560 --> 16:12.880
Can't.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.240
They can quit.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.320
Can we please approach this with a more clinical-

16:16.320 --> 16:18.640
These are all medical terms.

16:19.840 --> 16:22.800
I'm afraid you got Hershey Kissed tipples that just don't quit.

16:22.800 --> 16:23.200
Itis.

16:25.360 --> 16:28.640
We'll probably have to put you in some kind of, I don't know, sanitarium.

16:29.600 --> 16:29.840
Yeah.

16:30.480 --> 16:31.360
Here's one thing I know.

16:31.360 --> 16:32.720
There's a fetish for everything.

16:33.520 --> 16:34.240
I guess.

16:34.240 --> 16:37.680
You just gotta find that one person that loves that look.

16:37.680 --> 16:38.560
Cannot get enough.

16:38.560 --> 16:39.200
I bet there's a whole website-

16:39.200 --> 16:40.000
Oh, excuse me, Adam.

16:40.000 --> 16:45.120
I see that you have a grocery cart just full of bags of Hershey Kisses.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.080
Well.

16:46.080 --> 16:47.440
Are you in for a treat?

16:47.440 --> 16:48.640
Do I have a treat for you?

16:48.640 --> 16:50.480
There's a part of my body that looks like that?

16:51.280 --> 16:53.200
Would you like to enjoy it?

16:53.200 --> 16:58.480
There's a whole sub-sign on Brazzers that's just Hershey Nipples.

16:59.520 --> 16:59.920
I don't-

17:00.800 --> 17:01.440
What are you talking about?

17:01.440 --> 17:02.400
Is it like a porn thing?

17:02.400 --> 17:05.120
There's like another tab just for Hershey Nipples.

17:05.120 --> 17:05.920
You mean YouTube?

17:07.120 --> 17:07.280
No.

17:07.920 --> 17:09.680
No, you can't find this kind of stuff on YouTube.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.280
Oh, Prince Griffin.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.240
How do you-

17:12.240 --> 17:13.040
Are there-

17:13.040 --> 17:14.000
Is there like a-

17:14.000 --> 17:15.280
Is there like a Kegels-

17:16.080 --> 17:18.080
Is there like a shirt-level Kegels?

17:19.760 --> 17:24.560
Is there a torso-based Kegel regimen?

17:24.560 --> 17:25.200
I think it-

17:25.200 --> 17:29.200
Yeah, I think it's called like push-ups, right?

17:29.200 --> 17:32.160
But those aren't gonna affect the sinews.

17:32.160 --> 17:34.160
Right.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.720
The treble sinews.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.240
Well, here's what it is.

17:38.240 --> 17:41.520
It's a long-term commitment, because what you have to do is stand there and with two

17:41.520 --> 17:45.760
fingers of each hand, just push as hard as you can for like-

17:45.760 --> 17:46.640
Get back in there!

17:46.640 --> 17:49.760
It's like 12 hours a day for like a year.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.280
Please get back in me.

17:51.280 --> 17:55.600
And to say that you have this vocalization to you, you have to visualize smaller nipples.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.240
Get back in my chest.

17:56.240 --> 18:00.880
Because if you miss a day or do it for like 11 and a half hours, it actually gets worse.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.560
I think you exacerbate the issue.

18:02.560 --> 18:03.280
Yeah, no.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.520
They're gonna come back in greater numbers.

18:05.520 --> 18:06.560
Could you cut-

18:06.560 --> 18:10.160
All right, when I cut my finger, it heals, right?

18:10.160 --> 18:11.520
It heals, right?

18:11.520 --> 18:12.000
Yeah.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.200
Could you cut your nipples off and hope that-

18:15.200 --> 18:16.880
No, you're absolutely correct.

18:16.880 --> 18:20.000
You have to inject yourself with some lizard DNA first.

18:20.000 --> 18:20.320
Okay.

18:21.280 --> 18:22.800
Now I have lizard nipples.

18:22.800 --> 18:23.600
Great.

18:23.600 --> 18:24.080
That's the catch.

18:24.080 --> 18:24.640
Wonderful.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.520
And then you have to commit crimes.

18:29.040 --> 18:29.360
That's a big impact.

18:29.360 --> 18:30.320
Now I have to do a crime.

18:36.480 --> 18:37.360
You can probably tuck them.

18:37.360 --> 18:40.400
It's probably some sort of tucking maneuver there.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.160
Like fold them over.

18:42.160 --> 18:43.760
Depends on if they're functional or not.

18:43.760 --> 18:50.400
I guess it does depend on like, if you ever want to get anything from these nipples,

18:50.400 --> 18:51.760
the solution is probably gonna be different.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.760
Then you probably will want to go more homeopathic.

18:55.360 --> 19:04.640
If you're like cool with them just being more ornamentary, then you can really, I mean, take

19:04.640 --> 19:05.200
your pick.

19:05.200 --> 19:05.760
Take your choice.

19:05.760 --> 19:12.160
Could you have a wizard paint a painting of you in which the nipples of the painting get

19:12.160 --> 19:14.720
bigger as yours gets smaller?

19:14.720 --> 19:15.280
Yeah.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.320
But then-

19:16.320 --> 19:21.440
And you have to put it into the attic and never look at it because look at those gross

19:21.440 --> 19:22.160
nipples.

19:22.160 --> 19:22.960
Yeah, but I mean-

19:22.960 --> 19:23.760
Is it gross?

19:23.760 --> 19:24.320
Yeah.

19:24.880 --> 19:28.240
Then you could just have like a couple of little garbanzo beans down there if you let

19:28.240 --> 19:29.200
that spell get out of control.

19:29.200 --> 19:32.000
Well, that's the gypsy twist, because it just keeps getting smaller and smaller and smaller

19:32.000 --> 19:32.640
and smaller.

19:32.640 --> 19:34.000
Oh, until they disappear.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.400
Mm-hmm.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.800
That's what the original draft of Finner was.

19:38.800 --> 19:39.120
Mm-hmm.

19:40.320 --> 19:42.080
You hit my niece with your car.

19:42.080 --> 19:42.880
Little do you know-

19:42.880 --> 19:46.560
She'll be fine, but just as a little thing to make you feel bad.

19:46.560 --> 19:47.280
No, she's dead.

19:47.280 --> 19:47.840
No nipples.

19:47.840 --> 19:48.080
Oh crap.

19:48.080 --> 19:49.520
No, she's dead.

19:50.080 --> 19:54.240
So I'm going to lay upon you the most bodacious gypsy magic.

19:54.240 --> 19:56.560
I just started dating a 24-year-old guy.

19:56.560 --> 19:57.760
I'm 34.

19:57.760 --> 19:58.560
He's super sweet.

19:58.560 --> 20:02.720
We have just enough in common and not that it's fun and interesting getting to know each

20:02.720 --> 20:03.280
other.

20:03.280 --> 20:07.120
He stays at my place a couple of times a week and asks for a key to my place.

20:07.120 --> 20:09.920
I glossed over it, but I'm sure it will come up again soon.

20:09.920 --> 20:12.400
How do I handle this without making him feel bad?

20:12.400 --> 20:14.560
That's from Aged in Astoria.

20:14.560 --> 20:17.840
I'm guessing the bad feelings.

20:17.840 --> 20:20.560
You didn't say that you don't want to give him a key.

20:21.360 --> 20:22.960
I'm assuming that's implied.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.160
That's a pretty good-

20:24.160 --> 20:27.680
If that solution were available to us, we would hope that you would disclose that.

20:27.680 --> 20:35.840
So here's, sometimes the ambiguity of when you say you just started dating him, but then

20:35.840 --> 20:37.680
you say he stays over a couple of times a week.

20:37.680 --> 20:40.240
So it's been enough weeks that it's formed a pattern.

20:40.240 --> 20:43.040
Are we talking like a month, two months, six months?

20:44.880 --> 20:49.120
If you just started dating and it's less than a month, by all means, no.

20:49.920 --> 20:51.280
That's crazy.

20:51.280 --> 20:52.480
Don't give him a key.

20:52.480 --> 20:59.760
The only sort of chronological like measurement we have is that they say that they just started

20:59.760 --> 21:00.240
dating him.

21:00.880 --> 21:04.880
So no, that's no, no, no.

21:04.880 --> 21:08.320
Because like, listen, everybody, I love New York.

21:08.320 --> 21:12.080
It's a tremendous city full of bright lights and big people.

21:12.080 --> 21:13.040
I heart NY.

21:13.600 --> 21:14.080
I do.

21:14.080 --> 21:20.560
It's, everybody there is on some sort of chase or some sort of grind or some sort of groove

21:20.560 --> 21:31.280
or some sort of mystery, by which I mean that a lot of them will just take your shit.

21:31.280 --> 21:31.780
Yep.

21:32.800 --> 21:37.680
If you let them into your place and you don't pay attention for a second and they're on

21:37.680 --> 21:43.280
that grind too hard, you can just, you're new and you don't pay attention.

21:43.280 --> 21:47.840
Your new Keurig is like their Keurig now.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.480
24 is so, 24 is so young.

21:50.480 --> 21:52.720
He might as well be one of Fagan's boys.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.720
You might be dating the Artful Dodger.

21:54.720 --> 21:55.600
Are you ready for this?

21:55.600 --> 21:58.080
I just figured out how I handled this situation.

21:58.080 --> 22:01.600
Oh, see, I had a good one too, but let me hear yours and see if it's as good as mine.

22:01.600 --> 22:02.160
Okay.

22:02.160 --> 22:03.040
Because mine's great.

22:03.040 --> 22:08.560
If he brings it up again, you tell him that the landlord asked you not to make a copy.

22:08.560 --> 22:08.880
Yes.

22:09.520 --> 22:10.160
You two.

22:10.160 --> 22:14.160
I wish I had, I wish I could be your brother someday.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.480
I wish I just had like that brotherly link.

22:16.480 --> 22:18.560
Because here's the best thing about it.

22:19.520 --> 22:25.920
If in the future you decide you do want to give him one, you say like, listen, I really

22:25.920 --> 22:33.200
fought the landlord on it and I convinced him to let me do this for you.

22:33.200 --> 22:33.600
Yeah.

22:33.600 --> 22:37.680
No, that's a great thing about that is that you can continue to use this fictional landlord

22:37.680 --> 22:39.200
throughout your relationship.

22:39.200 --> 22:42.080
Sorry, he told me not to buy you an anniversary present.

22:42.080 --> 22:45.520
The landlord said I had to be, the landlord said I had to be big spoon.

22:45.520 --> 22:46.480
I don't know.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.640
Landlord said I should finish the milk and not replace it.

22:48.640 --> 22:50.000
He said it's a city code thing.

22:50.000 --> 22:50.640
I don't know.

22:50.640 --> 22:56.720
The only, the landlord said the only way I can not get evicted is if you do mouth stuff

22:56.720 --> 22:57.280
to me.

22:57.280 --> 22:58.400
It's a weird thing.

22:58.400 --> 23:00.080
And I don't know how we could even prove that.

23:00.080 --> 23:03.920
I'm actually thinking about breaking my lease because he is, this is very crazy.

23:03.920 --> 23:06.080
This is really, but no, if you insist.

23:06.080 --> 23:08.480
Now, but okay.

23:08.480 --> 23:12.960
So now that we've solved the problem for you, the question I have about it is, is there

23:12.960 --> 23:16.080
times that he's spending in your apartment that you're not there?

23:16.080 --> 23:19.200
Because if not, it's kind of a non issue, right?

23:19.200 --> 23:21.600
Like, as long as you're always there, why does he even need a key?

23:22.560 --> 23:22.960
Yeah.

23:22.960 --> 23:25.120
Why has he got to be there that you're not there?

23:25.120 --> 23:25.840
That's what I don't like.

23:25.840 --> 23:27.600
That's what's implicit with the key issue.

23:28.320 --> 23:28.720
Yes.

23:28.720 --> 23:32.960
I think the only time that that giving someone a key, that's it.

23:32.960 --> 23:37.120
There's a reason that in like sitcoms and movies, it's always such a big step because

23:37.120 --> 23:37.680
it is.

23:37.680 --> 23:40.800
And it's way bigger than I think people make it out to be these days.

23:40.800 --> 23:40.960
Yeah.

23:40.960 --> 23:45.360
But like, there's a big difference between someone who's basically living with you and

23:45.360 --> 23:47.680
someone who is living with you, right?

23:47.680 --> 23:50.640
Now giving them the key is saying like, Hey, you're living with me now.

23:51.280 --> 23:52.160
It's an important boundary.

23:52.880 --> 23:53.760
Let me ask you a question.

23:53.760 --> 23:57.600
When you ask him where he's living, does he give oddly vague answers?

23:57.600 --> 24:04.800
Sort of like, uptown, sort of here and there kind of answers.

24:04.800 --> 24:07.200
I'm kind of a citizen of the world.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.760
Kind of a citizen of the world.

24:09.760 --> 24:11.680
Does his breath always smell like beans?

24:12.560 --> 24:13.280
Don't.

24:13.280 --> 24:13.520
No.

24:15.360 --> 24:16.960
I'm not saying he's homeless.

24:16.960 --> 24:18.160
I'm saying he's a hobo.

24:18.160 --> 24:18.480
There's a big difference.

24:18.480 --> 24:19.280
He's a free spirit.

24:19.280 --> 24:20.320
He's a rail rider.

24:20.320 --> 24:21.120
Rail rider.

24:21.120 --> 24:22.400
He's a whale rider.

24:22.400 --> 24:23.280
He's a whale rider.

24:23.280 --> 24:24.800
An adventurous whale rider.

24:24.800 --> 24:28.240
An important storm, though, a hobo of the seas.

24:28.240 --> 24:29.760
A hobo, sea hobo.

24:32.240 --> 24:36.880
I mean, it's supposed to be an important boundary.

24:36.880 --> 24:39.760
Yeah, like Rachel doesn't even have a key to my car.

24:40.320 --> 24:42.320
I don't know what she's gonna do with that thing.

24:42.320 --> 24:43.120
I don't trust her.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.200
Yeah, you know, it's one of those there are questions and there are probably other ones

24:47.200 --> 24:48.320
that I'm just not thinking of right now.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.440
But like, there are things that should never be asked.

24:51.440 --> 24:56.320
They can only be offered because it's such an imbalance of power, right?

24:56.320 --> 24:58.080
It's not like, can we move in together?

24:58.080 --> 25:03.600
Because I think that's a sacrifice from two people like looking to make a decision together.

25:03.600 --> 25:10.080
Can I have a key to your place is like, that is, I have nothing to lose and you have everything

25:10.080 --> 25:14.640
to lose because if you look at every relationship that's ever happened in the history of the earth,

25:14.640 --> 25:19.040
no one at a month in thought, I bet this guy would take my TV.

25:19.040 --> 25:23.920
I bet this is the kind of guy that would poop on my floor and then leave.

25:23.920 --> 25:30.400
You know, I had a roommate once and her boyfriend, every so often I would like come out of my

25:30.400 --> 25:34.800
room and find her boyfriend there to find out that she was not home and he was just

25:34.800 --> 25:38.160
there hanging out in our living room and like hanging out at our house.

25:38.160 --> 25:42.480
And they'd been dating about three or four weeks at this point.

25:42.480 --> 25:49.360
And later after they broke up, I said, so why was he around so much in her response?

25:49.920 --> 25:56.320
Oh, his mom kicked him out because he sold their electronics for drugs.

25:56.320 --> 25:57.360
Awesome.

25:57.360 --> 25:58.800
Cool, cool, cool.

25:58.800 --> 26:01.360
And this is the dude that we just like had in our home.

26:01.360 --> 26:05.200
So here's the thing is like, even like, you don't know this dude.

26:05.200 --> 26:06.640
You don't know him that well.

26:06.640 --> 26:09.360
And even if you do, there's no rush to this.

26:09.360 --> 26:14.080
Like if he needs to hang out at your place, that's a much different discussion than to

26:14.080 --> 26:19.120
have constant access to it all the time, no matter what, no questions asked.

26:19.120 --> 26:19.920
You know what I mean?

26:19.920 --> 26:21.440
Happy we could help there.

26:21.440 --> 26:22.240
We seem very helpful.

26:22.240 --> 26:23.520
Yeah, just lie, I guess.

26:23.520 --> 26:25.120
How about another Yahoo?

26:26.720 --> 26:29.040
If you're sure, we got a lot of good questions too, though.

26:29.600 --> 26:30.080
It's up to you.

26:30.080 --> 26:30.560
Yeah.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.600
Not like your shitty Yahoos.

26:34.400 --> 26:37.760
Well, I don't know why we have to be so combative about it all of a sudden.

26:37.760 --> 26:40.960
I mean, I'm just saying that real questions are better.

26:40.960 --> 26:41.440
Just don't let me-

26:41.440 --> 26:43.360
How about just like a quick Yahoo, just a quick thinker.

26:43.360 --> 26:44.720
We don't even actually have to talk about it.

26:44.720 --> 26:48.240
I just want to sort of project this into the consciousness of America.

26:48.240 --> 26:49.520
Just like an amuse-bouche.

26:49.520 --> 26:54.560
I just want to amuse-bouche this into the hearts and minds of the real America.

26:54.560 --> 26:55.840
These are fucking amusing-bouche.

26:55.840 --> 27:00.960
And if you're a part of real America, you know that I'm talking to you.

27:01.760 --> 27:02.880
You know what I mean?

27:02.880 --> 27:03.360
Yes.

27:03.360 --> 27:04.240
Amuse our bouche.

27:05.840 --> 27:07.360
I didn't write down who gave it to us.

27:07.360 --> 27:08.880
Oh, it was, of course, Drew Davenport.

27:08.880 --> 27:09.840
Thank you, Drew Davenport.

27:11.120 --> 27:14.240
Yahoo Answers user Zenaida asks, and again, let's just like,

27:14.240 --> 27:16.960
let's make an agreement right now that we won't address this.

27:16.960 --> 27:22.800
I'll just say it and then project it into the minds of the real America and then we'll move on.

27:23.440 --> 27:26.320
But how does cat dog go to the bathroom?

27:28.080 --> 27:30.880
Does it come out of one of their mouths or something?

27:32.000 --> 27:33.200
So that's just out there now.

27:33.200 --> 27:34.080
Now it's in the sphere.

27:34.080 --> 27:35.200
Now it's in the ether.

27:35.200 --> 27:39.200
And people can, you know, digest that and just talk about it on our Reddit.

27:39.920 --> 27:41.520
Just like sort of put it out there.

27:41.520 --> 27:43.200
Here is another one by Drew Davenport, though.

27:43.200 --> 27:47.280
It's by Yahoo Answers user Rachel who asks, fast and furious party?

27:48.720 --> 27:53.760
I'm having a party for 18 year olds and can't think on what I can do for it.

27:54.400 --> 27:58.720
They all have their own character to be like for the night,

27:58.720 --> 28:01.520
but can't think of what else there is to do.

28:01.520 --> 28:05.920
I don't want the drugs side of it because we are all not like that.

28:07.040 --> 28:09.440
So has anyone got any ideas on what I can do?

28:10.160 --> 28:11.760
So we're talking about a themed.

28:12.800 --> 28:17.840
Okay, first I want to say I've seen at least four fast and furious movies.

28:17.840 --> 28:18.320
Okay.

28:18.320 --> 28:21.200
Drug use does not play into these movies.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.200
Not in a significant way.

28:23.200 --> 28:25.680
Not in any way that's like played up and addressed.

28:25.680 --> 28:27.600
Wait a minute party party thrower.

28:27.600 --> 28:31.280
Is it possible you haven't seen the fast and furious movies?

28:31.280 --> 28:34.080
Because if so, that would make this much more difficult.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.880
Because here's the key thing about these movies.

28:36.880 --> 28:38.480
It's driving cars.

28:38.480 --> 28:41.200
So unless you're driving cars inside this party,

28:41.760 --> 28:44.720
you're pretty much just people dressed in like tank tops.

28:44.720 --> 28:47.760
I mean, it's not all you are selling these.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.720
You are doing these movies at a tremendous discredit.

28:50.720 --> 28:52.560
Oh no, they're awesome.

28:52.560 --> 28:55.600
No, no, no, but I'm saying that there is a lot of human drama

28:55.600 --> 28:59.360
drama taking place not behind the wheel of the car.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.200
Not anywhere near a car.

29:02.080 --> 29:04.320
Away from cars is what I'm saying.

29:04.320 --> 29:06.160
They are non-car related.

29:06.160 --> 29:11.040
Non-car related friendships, loss, relationships, tanks, helicopters,

29:11.040 --> 29:14.960
helicopters, jet skis, four by fours, four wheelers.

29:14.960 --> 29:18.240
You should just come as a Tokyo drift character and say fuck everybody else.

29:18.240 --> 29:19.120
Fuck all y'all.

29:19.120 --> 29:21.200
This is the best flick in the franchise.

29:21.200 --> 29:22.560
Y'all don't even realize it.

29:22.560 --> 29:24.240
It's a future.

29:24.240 --> 29:26.080
I don't know a post cool.

29:26.720 --> 29:28.000
Yeah, it's not even a see.

29:28.880 --> 29:33.200
Every other Fast and Furious movie is a prequel to Tokyo Drift.

29:34.000 --> 29:34.960
It's all leading up.

29:34.960 --> 29:36.880
It's all building up to the past.

29:36.880 --> 29:39.760
Seven is a sequel to Tokyo Drift.

29:39.760 --> 29:41.040
Oh, is that true?

29:41.040 --> 29:44.240
Yeah, because Tokyo Drift is set in like 2015.

29:45.440 --> 29:46.240
You're making shit up.

29:46.240 --> 29:47.680
It's set in 2015.

29:47.680 --> 29:49.600
Like that's some future destiny.

29:49.600 --> 29:52.160
Well, when it came out in like 1999,

29:52.160 --> 29:55.200
come with us into the world of 2015.

29:55.200 --> 29:57.040
Your Mitsubishi still has wheels?

29:58.000 --> 29:58.480
I guess.

29:59.440 --> 30:00.320
All right.

30:00.320 --> 30:02.000
Come on my hover Mitsubishi.

30:02.000 --> 30:07.280
Uh, there's a, I just looked at the Wikipedia page for Fast and Furious

30:07.280 --> 30:08.720
and there's a bit about future.

30:08.720 --> 30:10.480
Like what the future of the franchise would be.

30:10.480 --> 30:14.880
The very first line is Vin Diesel indicated that he loves Fast and Furious 7.

30:16.240 --> 30:16.560
Great.

30:16.560 --> 30:20.240
What, what precisely would be the first folks?

30:20.240 --> 30:22.240
You know what, I'm going to go on the record here.

30:23.520 --> 30:24.480
I like this movie.

30:25.120 --> 30:27.840
That was a really solid Vin Diesel.

30:27.840 --> 30:31.360
I'm going to go on the record here and say, I like this film that I did.

30:32.320 --> 30:35.040
I did a film and it's, uh, it's pretty great.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.920
Um, Tokyo Drift.

30:37.920 --> 30:39.120
Can we talk, thank you.

30:39.120 --> 30:43.200
Can we talk though about, cause this is literally, I, I have,

30:43.200 --> 30:45.760
I'm always thinking about Fast and Furious movies.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.920
It's like my power jam in my head.

30:47.920 --> 30:49.840
It's not like a little song I sing to myself.

30:49.840 --> 30:53.920
It's just, I think about those movies and it makes me like fucking psyched.

30:53.920 --> 30:56.960
Um, but we do need to talk about Tokyo Drift because I've never really

30:56.960 --> 30:58.800
thought about this before in my life.

30:58.800 --> 31:05.280
Imagine if there was a series of skateboard films, a series of skating films.

31:06.320 --> 31:14.560
And one of the films they did was just called Skater Boys 4 Jumping.

31:15.520 --> 31:19.120
And it was about, and it was about a sect of skate.

31:19.120 --> 31:20.080
Australia jumping.

31:20.080 --> 31:25.920
It was about a sect of skateboarders who have now realized that they can

31:25.920 --> 31:27.920
get these goddamn things off the ground.

31:28.480 --> 31:37.200
It's talking, it's the feature that the star of Fast Fur3 Tokyo Drift was not

31:37.840 --> 31:42.640
whatever that, that hillbilly was that they cast in the lead role instead of the beautiful

31:42.640 --> 31:44.720
angelic Paul Walker.

31:44.720 --> 31:50.080
The soon to be DFI, the soon to be DFI Paul Walker who had a limited amount of acting

31:50.080 --> 31:54.720
time on this earth and they fucking squandered it and gave it to that fucking hillbilly.

31:54.720 --> 31:58.000
I do have a serious question that just to interrupt real quick.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.200
If anybody knows this, please let me know because I've never seen Tokyo Drift.

32:01.840 --> 32:05.760
Is that character supposed to be Paul Walker's character's son?

32:05.760 --> 32:06.320
No, no, no.

32:06.320 --> 32:08.240
Because they have a baby in like six.

32:08.240 --> 32:09.520
No, no relation.

32:09.520 --> 32:14.640
You are trying to build a connection, a thread that does not, a through line.

32:14.640 --> 32:16.080
It just doesn't make sense.

32:16.080 --> 32:17.200
That can be your side fiction.

32:17.200 --> 32:20.480
That can be your, your Ferris Bueller doesn't exist.

32:20.480 --> 32:24.160
I'm saying, I'm saying the hillbilly hack.

32:24.160 --> 32:27.440
Andy's mom, Andy's mom owned the guy from Tokyo Drift.

32:29.120 --> 32:33.680
I'm saying the hillbilly hack who starred in that movie was not the star of the movie.

32:33.680 --> 32:37.680
The star of that movie was a thing you can do with cars.

32:37.680 --> 32:42.160
It's like if they did Fast and the Furious Five, fast braking.

32:42.160 --> 32:45.040
And then it was all about fast braking.

32:45.040 --> 32:49.760
And then they made Fast and the Furious Six reverse driving.

32:49.760 --> 32:52.160
What they blew it on is what they should have done is at the end.

32:52.160 --> 32:53.200
Well, maybe they still will.

32:53.200 --> 32:57.840
At the end of Fast Seven, a car drifts and somebody goes, hold on.

32:58.640 --> 32:59.120
Wait a second.

32:59.120 --> 33:00.880
They've got something there.

33:00.880 --> 33:03.760
I'm going to go develop this technology in Japan.

33:03.760 --> 33:10.480
It would be like if in the movie Burger Time series, Burger Time 4 was just called ketchup.

33:10.480 --> 33:14.960
And at the beginning of the movie, someone like stepped on a tomato

33:14.960 --> 33:16.960
and poured some vinegar on it accidentally.

33:16.960 --> 33:19.360
It was like, the game done changed.

33:19.360 --> 33:19.840
Yeah.

33:19.840 --> 33:20.800
Here's your burger.

33:20.800 --> 33:22.000
You ain't got no ketchup.

33:22.720 --> 33:24.640
And then that would be Chris Tucker.

33:24.640 --> 33:28.880
Was that Chris Tucker in the movie?

33:28.880 --> 33:30.320
Burger Time 4 ketchup?

33:31.200 --> 33:34.160
Is Chris Tucker the star of that film or is it more of a cameo?

33:35.920 --> 33:37.600
Don't you know about condiments?

33:37.600 --> 33:38.800
Chris, get over here.

33:38.800 --> 33:39.040
Yeah.

33:39.040 --> 33:43.360
Yeah, that movie, it really is all about drifting.

33:43.360 --> 33:47.600
I don't know if you've seen Tokyo Drift, but it really is like they're racing in parking garages.

33:47.600 --> 33:51.360
And he like buses whip the fuck up because he's trying to get up those spins

33:51.360 --> 33:53.760
like through regular acceleration means.

33:53.760 --> 33:57.680
I wish I could be in the pitch meeting for that movie where they said like,

33:57.680 --> 33:59.920
hey, you know how much people love Fast and the Furious

33:59.920 --> 34:02.000
and then the sequel Fast and the Furious 2?

34:02.000 --> 34:04.560
Well, I've got another idea for a Fast and the Furious movie.

34:04.560 --> 34:05.760
Here's the twist.

34:05.760 --> 34:09.040
It has nothing to do with those other Fast and the Furious movies.

34:09.040 --> 34:12.160
Somebody just drives a car real fast and slides into things.

34:12.160 --> 34:12.480
Yeah.

34:12.480 --> 34:13.040
Sounds good.

34:13.600 --> 34:14.400
How much you want?

34:14.400 --> 34:15.040
Can I say something?

34:15.040 --> 34:16.560
Can I say something perhaps contentious?

34:17.120 --> 34:18.480
It's a pretty fucking tight movie.

34:19.200 --> 34:19.600
What?

34:19.600 --> 34:20.480
How does it compare?

34:20.480 --> 34:23.440
Do you like it better than your base Fast and the Furious?

34:23.440 --> 34:28.320
It lacks the bombast of Fast 5 and Fast 6 onward.

34:28.320 --> 34:35.760
Does it have a buddy feel to it on the same level of Walker and Diesel?

34:35.760 --> 34:39.760
There will never be another buddy feel like that buddy feel.

34:39.760 --> 34:41.520
God took it away from us.

34:41.520 --> 34:42.560
Thanks, God.

34:42.560 --> 34:46.480
I've lived my whole life for you and this is how you do me.

34:46.480 --> 34:51.680
I was so excited about the triumvirate of Diesel, Walker, and Rock.

34:51.680 --> 34:53.440
Yeah, we were all pretty fucking excited about it.

34:53.440 --> 34:54.480
And God was like, oh, nope, nope.

34:54.480 --> 34:55.280
This is too cool.

34:55.280 --> 34:56.080
They're not ready for this.

34:56.080 --> 34:56.560
It's too cool.

34:56.560 --> 34:57.840
Puh-luck.

34:59.040 --> 35:00.400
Let me just get that real quick.

35:00.400 --> 35:00.960
Fourth time.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.240
It's fucking a shame.

35:02.240 --> 35:02.960
This is too cool.

35:02.960 --> 35:04.880
This was supposed to be the last thing they ever did.

35:04.880 --> 35:06.240
We can't let them get here yet.

35:06.240 --> 35:07.600
Let me just pull up.

35:07.600 --> 35:09.280
This is the end of humanity.

35:10.080 --> 35:12.720
This is supposed to be the big finale.

35:12.720 --> 35:14.240
Are they making a Bill and Ted's 3?

35:14.960 --> 35:17.040
They've been talking about it forever, but whatever.

35:17.040 --> 35:20.560
In this one, I want him to travel to heaven again and get Paul Walker and bring him back.

35:21.120 --> 35:22.720
I mean, that's not how movies work.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.240
Can we go to the My Zone?

35:24.240 --> 35:26.640
I'm so fucking mad.

35:26.640 --> 35:27.360
I know.

35:27.360 --> 35:30.480
It's just like, I'm not, this isn't like a goof.

35:30.480 --> 35:35.120
This isn't like a goof thing that I do where I talk about, oh, aren't celebrities weird?

35:35.120 --> 35:37.920
It's like, I'm fucking mad.

35:37.920 --> 35:42.400
To say nothing of the fact that, and I feel like we kind of gave God a pass on this when

35:42.400 --> 35:45.680
it happened, but like, God took one of the deedles.

35:45.680 --> 35:48.640
He took half of the deedles from us as if this wouldn't be enough.

35:48.640 --> 35:50.800
The only still functioning deedle.

35:50.800 --> 35:56.480
The only deedle who is still an active deedle.

35:57.360 --> 35:57.760
Shit.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.000
This is how you do me.

36:00.000 --> 36:00.960
Oh my God.

36:00.960 --> 36:03.520
Fucking Fast and the Furious deedles crossover.

36:04.480 --> 36:05.600
Other deedle rolls up.

36:05.600 --> 36:06.720
I mean, we can't.

36:06.720 --> 36:07.680
Sorry about my brother.

36:07.680 --> 36:08.400
We can't now.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.240
But I'm here to take over.

36:10.240 --> 36:11.440
It's all in the deedle verse.

36:12.160 --> 36:15.120
You see Paul Walker and Steve Van Warman together, you think deedles.

36:15.120 --> 36:18.480
You see Steve Van Warman by himself and he's, who's that?

36:18.480 --> 36:26.720
I have partial face blindness that only extends to Steve Van Warmer, not in the presence of

36:26.720 --> 36:28.800
Paul Walker, which is to say forever now.

36:28.800 --> 36:30.080
Thank you, God.

36:30.080 --> 36:31.920
Do appreciate you killing one of the deedles.

36:31.920 --> 36:32.480
Not at all.

36:33.440 --> 36:34.400
What a jerk.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.640
Great A job up there.

36:36.640 --> 36:37.920
Great A job.

36:37.920 --> 36:39.200
They didn't even make two.

36:39.200 --> 36:40.960
They didn't make deedles two.

36:40.960 --> 36:42.240
Big bad deedle borgs.

36:43.520 --> 36:47.200
By the way, big bad deedle borgs would have been the fucking sweetest.

36:47.200 --> 36:49.120
Fast eight big bad deedle borgs.

36:50.240 --> 36:51.520
They find, they get armor.

36:53.680 --> 36:56.560
I mean, it would be called fast and the furious.

36:56.560 --> 36:58.960
No number armor boys.

36:58.960 --> 37:00.640
And then it would be about armor.

37:00.640 --> 37:01.440
But here's the problem.

37:01.440 --> 37:05.760
We couldn't have Paul Walker and that other fuck you just said in the picture.

37:05.760 --> 37:08.400
It would have to be some another hillbilly hick.

37:08.400 --> 37:10.240
Another piece of garbage actor.

37:10.240 --> 37:11.280
That's not Paul Walker.

37:12.160 --> 37:13.200
Fucking fuck it.

37:13.200 --> 37:13.520
Fuck.

37:13.520 --> 37:14.800
Just do the money zone.

37:14.800 --> 37:26.240
Surf Wyoming, damn it.

37:26.240 --> 37:28.720
Guys, coding is the most desired job.

37:32.320 --> 37:33.440
Surfing is not.

37:34.640 --> 37:36.560
You have like, so let's like go.

37:36.560 --> 37:38.720
Let's let's go behind the curtain here.

37:38.720 --> 37:40.640
Well, I want to talk about one one HTML.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.360
Let me give you the big pitch.

37:43.360 --> 37:45.840
It's the easiest way to learn code to build websites.

37:45.840 --> 37:50.960
You do 30 minutes a day for 30 days and you'll build an actual website starting from day one.

37:50.960 --> 37:56.240
You'll be welcomed into a community also of 12,000 other students who are learning online.

37:57.680 --> 37:59.680
So you want to go inside something.

38:00.560 --> 38:01.440
You've been doing this.

38:01.440 --> 38:03.840
You've, you've actually been, you've been doing this.

38:03.840 --> 38:04.800
I signed up.

38:04.800 --> 38:09.760
It is, it is extremely reasonable for the, the one month class.

38:09.760 --> 38:13.520
I'm taking HTML, the one month HTML course.

38:13.520 --> 38:15.920
Does that cover cascading style sheets as well?

38:16.560 --> 38:18.400
There is some CSS in there.

38:18.400 --> 38:18.640
Yes.

38:19.920 --> 38:21.760
So the way it works is actually really good for me.

38:22.480 --> 38:26.640
For my like way of doing stuff is that you watch a video basically in one window

38:27.440 --> 38:31.040
and then in another window and sort of the HTML editor,

38:31.040 --> 38:33.840
you code along with what they're doing.

38:33.840 --> 38:38.800
And after the, like the first few lessons, like I had actually like,

38:38.800 --> 38:40.880
like I had a functioning website.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.800
I literally, I work on the internet.

38:42.800 --> 38:46.000
I, I, I am the managing editor of a website.

38:46.000 --> 38:51.600
And after one week of this course, I think I understand like exponentially,

38:51.600 --> 38:55.120
exponentially more about this entire process.

38:55.120 --> 38:59.600
And like, I have designed my own website now as part of the project.

38:59.600 --> 39:02.560
Like that's how it, that's how it ends at the end of the first week

39:02.560 --> 39:04.240
is you making your own website.

39:04.240 --> 39:07.760
That kind of put you, and I felt like comfortable doing that,

39:07.760 --> 39:10.240
at least having like enough vocabulary.

39:10.240 --> 39:12.640
Honestly, the biggest problem I have with this,

39:12.640 --> 39:17.680
this class is not doing more than one day's worth of classes in,

39:17.680 --> 39:19.040
in a setting because it's really fun.

39:19.040 --> 39:20.160
It's intoxicating.

39:20.160 --> 39:20.640
Yeah.

39:20.640 --> 39:22.480
It's a lot of fun and I'm really enjoying it.

39:22.480 --> 39:25.600
You can enroll at one month.com slash my brother,

39:25.600 --> 39:28.160
and they're going to give you 25% off.

39:28.160 --> 39:32.320
So you could have like a whole new skill in 30 minutes a day for 30 days.

39:32.320 --> 39:37.040
And even that's not like, like I, I have a huge,

39:37.040 --> 39:38.800
much better understanding of HTML.

39:38.800 --> 39:42.480
Like after a week, I understand so much more and it's a lot of fun to do.

39:43.360 --> 39:46.000
And you can get a 25% discount from us.

39:46.000 --> 39:52.880
So go to one month.com slash my brother and go, go learn yourself a new skill.

39:54.640 --> 39:56.640
While you're doing that, you're going to have one key,

39:56.640 --> 39:59.360
hand on the keyboard, rattling out functions,

39:59.360 --> 40:06.480
rattling out, um, transistors and, and like functions and stuff.

40:06.480 --> 40:12.400
And your other hand is going to be, is going to be wrist deep in a sweet bag of,

40:12.400 --> 40:13.360
Oh, I don't know.

40:13.360 --> 40:18.160
Baked sweet potato fries, peanut butter, nom-noms or dark cocoa almonds.

40:18.640 --> 40:20.560
Cause you're going to become a nature box subscriber.

40:20.560 --> 40:23.200
If you aren't already one, we're talking about,

40:23.200 --> 40:24.720
this is something I want to, okay.

40:24.720 --> 40:27.520
Sometimes we sell things and like, you need to start doing this.

40:27.520 --> 40:29.520
You're already snacking now.

40:29.520 --> 40:31.920
Yeah, this isn't a thing we're asking you to do.

40:31.920 --> 40:33.440
We're asking you to revolutionize.

40:33.440 --> 40:40.240
We're asking you to, uh, I got some, they have a few new recommendations.

40:40.240 --> 40:43.600
They have cinnamon, sugar, corn kernels, sort of like, uh,

40:43.600 --> 40:46.800
in the corn nuts vein, but like sweet and crunchy.

40:46.800 --> 40:48.560
Yeah, it's like really good.

40:48.560 --> 40:50.800
And then there's a, what else did we get?

40:50.800 --> 40:53.760
Chocolate, quinoa, granola.

40:53.760 --> 40:54.240
Yeah.

40:54.240 --> 40:59.840
Ooh, I still don't understand the structure of that snack.

40:59.840 --> 41:01.040
You eat that with a spoon.

41:01.040 --> 41:01.920
You know what I do?

41:01.920 --> 41:04.560
I crumble it onto my yogurt.

41:04.560 --> 41:06.080
You crazy mother fucker.

41:06.080 --> 41:06.720
I know.

41:06.720 --> 41:07.760
I'm against the grain.

41:07.760 --> 41:08.800
Change the game.

41:08.800 --> 41:09.040
Yeah.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.840
And Sydney likes it on her ice cream.

41:11.840 --> 41:13.200
So that's, that's how we do.

41:13.760 --> 41:15.040
Um, that sounds really good.

41:15.040 --> 41:16.640
Now it won't make your ice cream healthy.

41:16.640 --> 41:17.280
It doesn't work.

41:17.280 --> 41:18.240
No, not like that.

41:18.240 --> 41:19.120
It's not.

41:19.120 --> 41:20.080
It makes it neutral.

41:20.080 --> 41:21.760
No alchemical properties to it.

41:21.760 --> 41:24.480
It about, it doesn't do that either.

41:24.480 --> 41:26.240
Um, but it is tasty.

41:26.240 --> 41:27.520

41:27.520 --> 41:31.040

And, uh, you're going to get a healthy treat for half off.

41:40.080 --> 41:43.200
Let me say in any other, more than any other product we advertise in the show,

41:43.200 --> 41:46.160
people get on board with, uh, nature box.

41:46.160 --> 41:49.440
Um, maybe, maybe not more than any other, but, but it's certainly up there.

41:49.440 --> 41:53.840
And, uh, we see a ton of pictures of people getting them and very much enjoying them.

41:54.400 --> 41:54.640
Yeah.

41:54.640 --> 41:56.160
It's, it's so great too.

41:56.160 --> 42:00.320
When everybody, uh, tweets about, you know, that they were on that, uh,

42:00.320 --> 42:02.960
nature box tip because the awesome and makes us feel good.

42:02.960 --> 42:05.920
And it also shows our advertisers how much power we wield.

42:05.920 --> 42:10.800
So thank you everybody for the crazy, like we shouldn't know one man should have all

42:10.800 --> 42:14.880
this power, especially when they're just like three fucks that like just three

42:14.880 --> 42:19.360
chuckle fuck just like chuckle fuck in their way through life on a wing in a prayer.

42:19.360 --> 42:24.560
Um, a one month HTML tweeted at me after I said, I had started the program and they said,

42:24.560 --> 42:26.000
you're doing great, Justin.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.560
I guess Griffin was wrong about you being a chuckle fuck.

42:30.400 --> 42:31.440
I'm not sure about that.

42:31.440 --> 42:33.520
Um, I have a message for Arjuna.

42:33.520 --> 42:34.560
You think that's how that said?

42:35.120 --> 42:35.360
Yeah.

42:36.160 --> 42:36.880
I like it.

42:36.880 --> 42:38.000
Or Arjuna.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.360
Is it a hard J?

42:39.360 --> 42:40.560
I think it's soft J, Arjuna.

42:40.560 --> 42:41.120
Okay.

42:41.120 --> 42:45.920
Arjuna Logan young, uh, from David and will who say, Hey, it's your birthday.

42:45.920 --> 42:47.040
You big, beautiful bitch.

42:47.920 --> 42:53.600
I am so sorry that I said that out loud to you about you, but I didn't read anything.

42:53.600 --> 42:54.640
I'll read it.

42:54.640 --> 42:55.840
I'll say whatever.

42:55.840 --> 42:58.480
But, um, David, that was David and will.

42:58.480 --> 43:00.160
So just like imagine I'll say it in like a different.

43:00.160 --> 43:01.760
It sounded more like David than will.

43:02.480 --> 43:03.040
Yeah.

43:03.040 --> 43:04.960
That's more of a David vibe for sure.

43:04.960 --> 43:06.000
I'm going to do a different voice.

43:06.000 --> 43:10.160
So nobody can like take this and put it in like, uh, and we can like splice it.

43:10.160 --> 43:10.880
You know what I mean?

43:10.880 --> 43:12.720
And make it sound like I'm calling somebody a bitch.

43:12.720 --> 43:13.520
Cause I never would.

43:13.520 --> 43:15.680
I don't use that word ever.

43:15.680 --> 43:15.920
Okay.

43:17.120 --> 43:18.160
Hey, it's your birthday.

43:18.160 --> 43:19.360
You big, beautiful bitch.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.040
No, that feels weird.

43:21.040 --> 43:24.240
You are finally fulfilling your lifelong goal of being a part-time stripper.

43:24.240 --> 43:28.080
And the only thing that can make your life better is having the brothers McElroy

43:28.080 --> 43:29.600
judge your life choices.

43:29.600 --> 43:30.240
We love you.

43:30.240 --> 43:31.120
Happy birthday.

43:31.120 --> 43:31.600
P.S.

43:31.600 --> 43:33.680
We hope they had fun trying to pronounce your name.

43:33.680 --> 43:34.000
Yeah.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.760
I mean, you, you did get us on that one.

43:36.320 --> 43:38.080
You did pull, you did pull a fast one.

43:38.080 --> 43:40.000
We do not do here as judge.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.760
No, especially people's life choices.

43:41.760 --> 43:43.200
Like we were over that face.

43:43.760 --> 43:45.440
We're good for you.

43:45.440 --> 43:46.320
Enjoy stripping.

43:46.320 --> 43:51.600
Do you guys sometimes feel like you're more sensitive than like other people that you

43:51.600 --> 43:57.520
know, because of this podcast where we have learned how to just like fucking be, you know?

43:58.320 --> 43:58.720
Yeah.

43:58.720 --> 44:02.960
I don't think we were good at just like being before we started this show.

44:03.520 --> 44:08.720
Just do you, you know, JK, JK living Arjuna.

44:08.720 --> 44:09.360
That's what I say.

44:09.360 --> 44:10.320
You want to be a stripper?

44:10.320 --> 44:10.880
Fuck it.

44:10.880 --> 44:11.200
Do it.

44:11.200 --> 44:11.600
JK.

44:11.600 --> 44:12.160
Rowling.

44:12.160 --> 44:12.720
JK.

44:12.720 --> 44:13.680
Rowling Arjuna.

44:13.680 --> 44:14.400
Do it.

44:14.400 --> 44:14.720
Do it.

44:14.720 --> 44:16.240
This next message for Elliot.

44:16.240 --> 44:16.800
It's from.

44:16.800 --> 44:17.280
Happy birthday.

44:17.280 --> 44:18.800
Happy birthday Arjuna.

44:18.800 --> 44:20.640
And his next message is for Elliot.

44:20.640 --> 44:21.360
It's from Matt Hall.

44:21.360 --> 44:23.840
This is probably the best.

44:23.840 --> 44:29.440
I don't want to like put too much pressure on this message.

44:29.440 --> 44:33.760
But of all the personal messages we've ever read on the show, this one is my favorite.

44:33.760 --> 44:34.240
Oh, wow.

44:34.240 --> 44:38.080
Sometimes people will write one and they'll like go over their character limit.

44:38.080 --> 44:40.800
So to like cut short or try to like put too much in.

44:40.800 --> 44:42.240
It gets really confusing.

44:42.240 --> 44:43.840
I feel like Matt has nailed it.

44:43.840 --> 44:47.280
And Matt says, thanks for vibing it and keeping it tight.

44:47.280 --> 44:48.880
If you need me, I'm on my mobile.

44:51.120 --> 44:52.400
So fast.

44:52.400 --> 44:53.680
I'm so fast.

44:53.680 --> 44:54.400
Full stop.

44:54.400 --> 45:00.000
I'm fucking uncomfortable with the funniest thing that has been said on this episode so far.

45:00.800 --> 45:03.200
Being authored by somebody who isn't us.

45:03.200 --> 45:04.080
It's the bet.

45:04.080 --> 45:06.080
Like, please, people concision.

45:06.080 --> 45:08.640
Look at how well Matt Hall has done.

45:08.640 --> 45:11.680
You don't even need to know what occasion this is for.

45:11.680 --> 45:12.720
And do you know what that is?

45:12.720 --> 45:13.280
Good job.

45:13.280 --> 45:19.040
This is almost, I like it almost as a like a fungible measurement of Elliot.

45:19.040 --> 45:23.520
You got 350 characters for your hundo bucks.

45:23.520 --> 45:24.480
Is it a hundo bucks?

45:25.520 --> 45:26.320
150?

45:26.320 --> 45:26.960
But who knows?

45:26.960 --> 45:27.440
Who knows?

45:27.440 --> 45:28.640
It's in that range.

45:28.640 --> 45:31.520
You can get a message on the show, maximumflood.org slash chumbotron.

45:31.520 --> 45:39.840
For your money, you only use maybe 25% of your allotted characters.

45:39.840 --> 45:44.240
So that's you saying, that's you like pissing that money away because you fucking got it to piss.

45:45.040 --> 45:47.280
And I love that style.

45:47.280 --> 45:49.120
That's a big, that's a big move.

45:49.120 --> 45:51.200
So I don't know what to reiterate here.

45:51.200 --> 45:52.560
Happy life.

45:52.560 --> 45:53.360
Happy vibing.

45:53.360 --> 45:55.600
You're fucking doing it every day.

45:56.320 --> 45:58.000
Yeah, you're crushing it, Elliot.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.760
Apparently, thank you for vibing and keeping it tight.

46:01.760 --> 46:03.280
If you need me, I'm on my mobile.

46:06.880 --> 46:12.880
I also like people paying $100 to communicate benign messages to each other.

46:12.880 --> 46:14.080
I do too.

46:14.080 --> 46:16.160
Hey, on your way home, bring home some milk.

46:16.160 --> 46:17.040
Thanks, McElroy's.

46:17.040 --> 46:17.840
Here's a C note.

46:18.400 --> 46:21.680
Especially when it is next available.

46:21.680 --> 46:23.360
So he's just on his mobile.

46:23.360 --> 46:28.800
And he said, I want to tell this pointless message to my friend in a month and a half for $100.

46:30.320 --> 46:36.640
It's like we're like, we've invented a new like, we've like developed this new communications app.

46:36.640 --> 46:40.880
It's like the new Snapchat, except it's the shittiest imaginable.

46:40.880 --> 46:42.240
And it costs you a ton of money.

46:42.240 --> 46:43.840
It costs a ton of money and people are crazy about it.

46:43.840 --> 46:45.040
And you have no idea when it's going to happen.

46:45.040 --> 46:46.480
It's like worse than the Pony Express.

46:48.560 --> 46:50.400
Hey, feeling lonely?

46:50.400 --> 46:51.920
My name's Jesse Thorn.

46:51.920 --> 46:53.920
My name's Jordan Morris.

46:53.920 --> 46:59.920
Do you want to listen to a program where two good friends get intimate with amazing guests

46:59.920 --> 47:05.920
like Maria Bamford, Rob Corddry, and other comedy superstars?

47:05.920 --> 47:08.240
Jordan Jesse Go is here for you.

47:08.240 --> 47:12.640
Every week we'll spill our guts for you and then make some jokes.

47:12.640 --> 47:16.400
Jordan Jesse Go, free at MaximumFun.org.

47:18.000 --> 47:21.840
A celebrity couple just moved in literally across the hall from my girlfriend and I.

47:21.840 --> 47:26.000
We met only the husband who we didn't recognize at first, but he looked familiar.

47:26.000 --> 47:29.280
And after telling us he worked in entertainment, we looked him up on IMDB.

47:29.280 --> 47:32.160
Turns out he's married to someone very famous and an actress.

47:32.160 --> 47:34.000
And both my girlfriend and I really like.

47:34.000 --> 47:38.160
How do we acknowledge we are fans of their work without coming off as creepy from Anxious in Atlanta?

47:38.160 --> 47:39.840
How could you do this to me?

47:39.840 --> 47:43.520
How could you write a question like that and not say who it is?

47:43.520 --> 47:44.480
What in the fuck?

47:46.480 --> 47:48.240
Are you protecting their anonymity?

47:48.240 --> 47:49.440
We don't know who you are.

47:49.440 --> 47:55.200
Or, I want to tell you guys, this is, I found, listen, look at this.

47:55.200 --> 47:59.360
Yahoo Answers has provided a service to me.

47:59.360 --> 48:02.880
Yahoo Answers has provided value to me as a person.

48:02.880 --> 48:04.080
Here's the question.

48:04.080 --> 48:06.080
Which celebrities live in Atlanta?

48:06.080 --> 48:06.320
Okay.

48:07.040 --> 48:10.480
Now this was answered six years ago by Spider-Man 7086.

48:11.040 --> 48:12.880
So, X.

48:13.520 --> 48:17.760
So, it may not be current, but let me hit you with some of the people.

48:17.760 --> 48:22.160
It could be that this person has seen in Atlanta.

48:22.160 --> 48:24.400
I live in Atlanta and so far I've seen.

48:25.280 --> 48:25.520
Okay.

48:26.080 --> 48:27.120
The yin yang twins.

48:28.480 --> 48:29.040
Probably not.

48:29.040 --> 48:30.160
They are married to each other.

48:31.920 --> 48:32.960
Not in Georgia they aren't.

48:32.960 --> 48:35.360
Lil Jon and the East Side Boys.

48:35.360 --> 48:37.520
Hey, little girl, let me whisper in your ear.

48:37.520 --> 48:40.880
Can you please walk the dog and on your way home get some orange juice?

48:40.880 --> 48:41.440
I love you.

48:43.600 --> 48:44.960
Lil Jon and the East Side Boys.

48:44.960 --> 48:46.160
Mm-hmm.

48:46.720 --> 48:47.840
All of them married to each other.

48:48.880 --> 48:51.440
Now you could go knock on Lil Jon's door to say,

48:51.440 --> 48:53.360
Lil Jon, turn down for what?

48:53.360 --> 48:56.080
The what in this case is you live across the hall from me.

48:56.640 --> 48:57.760
Please turnt it down.

48:57.760 --> 49:00.400
And I've got an important meeting in the morning and I just really need to catch up.

49:00.400 --> 49:00.800
So that is why.

49:00.800 --> 49:04.240
A crazy, crumping dude just like crashed through my ceiling.

49:04.240 --> 49:06.080
And somehow I feel like you are the one to blame.

49:06.080 --> 49:07.440
So turn down, please.

49:07.440 --> 49:08.960
Please do turn down for this.

49:08.960 --> 49:09.360
For this.

49:10.080 --> 49:10.800
This is the cause.

49:11.440 --> 49:11.920
Usher.

49:11.920 --> 49:13.680
Hmm.

49:13.680 --> 49:14.880
Jermaine Dupree.

49:16.560 --> 49:17.520
Janet Jackson.

49:18.560 --> 49:19.040
No.

49:19.040 --> 49:19.840
Because here's the thing.

49:19.840 --> 49:21.360
They didn't recognize him at first.

49:21.360 --> 49:22.960
If it's fucking Janet Jackson.

49:22.960 --> 49:23.920
You're going to recognize him.

49:23.920 --> 49:25.280
Who is that again?

49:25.280 --> 49:26.000
Okay.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.960
Here's where things get a little weird in this list.

49:30.240 --> 49:32.640
There's a few more people that I would probably recognize.

49:32.640 --> 49:34.720
T-Pain, Ludacris.

49:34.720 --> 49:38.960
The problem with recognizing T-Pain is it could also be a monster.

49:38.960 --> 49:41.840
You could accidentally identify as a monster.

49:41.840 --> 49:44.560
It could be a monster boogie man who's come to steal your soul.

49:46.080 --> 49:47.360
That's the other problem with T-Pain.

49:47.360 --> 49:48.480
But Ludacris.

49:49.120 --> 49:49.600
Okay.

49:49.600 --> 49:50.160
You would know.

49:50.160 --> 49:51.120
You would know.

49:51.120 --> 49:54.080
The guy who invented the Ziploc bag.

49:55.040 --> 49:55.680
No.

49:55.680 --> 49:56.080
Okay.

49:57.440 --> 49:57.920
Who?

49:57.920 --> 49:58.560
Okay.

49:58.560 --> 49:59.440
Important thing.

50:00.000 --> 50:04.000
Who recognizes that guy on site and puts that in the Yahoo Antics?

50:04.000 --> 50:05.680
Had to have been wearing a t-shirt.

50:05.680 --> 50:08.480
Had to have been wearing a t-shirt that said ask me about my invention on the back.

50:08.480 --> 50:10.160
I think that's Anthony Ziploc.

50:10.160 --> 50:11.600
Ask me about my super tight bags.

50:12.160 --> 50:13.520
Is that Tony Ziploc?

50:13.520 --> 50:14.000
I think so.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.600
He's got the super tight bag shirt.

50:15.600 --> 50:16.800
Are there any other celebs?

50:16.800 --> 50:17.680
Because we haven't answered this question.

50:17.680 --> 50:18.480
Ted Turner.

50:19.120 --> 50:19.520
Sure.

50:19.520 --> 50:19.760
No.

50:20.480 --> 50:20.640
Yeah.

50:20.640 --> 50:22.160
He just moved in across the hall.

50:22.160 --> 50:23.040
Tyler Perry.

50:24.240 --> 50:24.960
Okay.

50:24.960 --> 50:25.520
Okay.

50:25.520 --> 50:25.840
All.

50:25.840 --> 50:26.080
Okay.

50:26.720 --> 50:29.520
All the Braves, Falcons, and Hawks.

50:29.520 --> 50:30.240
So yes.

50:30.240 --> 50:31.040
I mean, yes.

50:31.040 --> 50:31.280
Yeah.

50:31.280 --> 50:31.600
All right.

50:31.600 --> 50:32.400
Fine.

50:32.400 --> 50:33.760
Andre 3000.

50:33.760 --> 50:34.480
Big boy.

50:34.480 --> 50:35.280
Young Jeezy.

50:35.280 --> 50:36.000
Bone Crusher.

50:36.000 --> 50:36.800
Young Bloods.

50:36.800 --> 50:37.520
Young Jock.

50:37.520 --> 50:38.000
CeeLo.

50:38.000 --> 50:38.500
Okay.

50:39.280 --> 50:39.840
Jane Fonda.

50:39.840 --> 50:41.120
I've just had a question occur to me.

50:41.120 --> 50:41.360
Okay.

50:41.360 --> 50:43.920
And I'm going to try to phrase it very, very carefully.

50:43.920 --> 50:45.920
Because I do not mean to offend the question asker.

50:46.560 --> 50:48.320
I do not know your living situation.

50:48.320 --> 50:51.520
I don't know what this building that you live in is like.

50:52.960 --> 50:58.080
What is a celebrity couple that is just like renting an apartment across from you?

50:58.080 --> 50:58.320
So.

50:58.320 --> 50:59.840
Oh, people do that all the time.

50:59.840 --> 51:00.000
Yeah.

51:00.000 --> 51:00.480
I was.

51:00.480 --> 51:00.880
Yeah.

51:00.880 --> 51:03.120
Here would be my guest on a shoot maybe.

51:03.920 --> 51:06.560
Maybe on location in Atlanta.

51:06.560 --> 51:08.000
Or maybe they have like family in Atlanta.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.560
It's not where they want their main house to be, but maybe they got like a little.

51:10.560 --> 51:11.760
Maybe they'll have like a loft there.

51:11.760 --> 51:12.240
Sure.

51:12.240 --> 51:13.040
Yeah, absolutely.

51:14.240 --> 51:20.880
I would like to think that it would be totally chill if you just like ran into the hallway

51:20.880 --> 51:23.920
and said like, oh, hey, I loved you and such and such.

51:23.920 --> 51:25.040
Nice meeting you.

51:25.040 --> 51:26.400
Welcome to the building.

51:26.400 --> 51:26.800
Okay.

51:26.800 --> 51:27.920
See you around.

51:27.920 --> 51:31.200
I bet it would be so novel for this person if you would just not.

51:32.160 --> 51:33.040
Maybe you could just like.

51:33.040 --> 51:33.680
What if you just like.

51:33.680 --> 51:34.480
That's where I'm at.

51:34.480 --> 51:38.240
Like a housewarming present or like invited him over for dinner sometime and treated him

51:38.240 --> 51:39.440
like a normal human being.

51:39.440 --> 51:39.600
Right.

51:39.600 --> 51:41.920
But that's not how normal human beings operate.

51:41.920 --> 51:44.160
Travis, when have you ever gone next door?

51:44.160 --> 51:47.760
Well, not normal macro human beings, but like normal sociable.

51:47.760 --> 51:50.400
We are the most normal human being.

51:50.400 --> 51:51.280
We represent.

51:52.320 --> 51:53.200
Real America.

51:53.200 --> 51:59.760
We represent an identikit of real America that like we are the mold.

51:59.760 --> 52:01.200
Travis, nobody does this.

52:01.200 --> 52:03.680
Have you gone upstairs to your neighbors upstairs and be like, hey,

52:03.680 --> 52:04.960
we made pot pie.

52:04.960 --> 52:06.320
Come on down for our pot pie.

52:07.040 --> 52:10.000
No, but by the way, I loved you and failure to launch.

52:12.640 --> 52:18.240
I just like I can't be I can't even I'm trying to be funny.

52:18.240 --> 52:23.280
I can't stop being so angry at this person for not telling me who this person is.

52:25.600 --> 52:27.280
I mean, here's because here's the thing.

52:27.280 --> 52:31.600
I agree with you, Justin, not only because I desperately want to know who it is,

52:31.600 --> 52:33.440
but I also think that it's an important fact.

52:33.440 --> 52:38.080
If it's somebody who's like known for being totally chill and cool and,

52:38.080 --> 52:41.280
you know, or if it's someone who's known for being kind of reclusive

52:41.280 --> 52:44.160
and not wanting to talk to the press, that's a huge difference.

52:44.160 --> 52:45.520
Can I hit you with this?

52:46.240 --> 52:49.680
Can I hit you with this Donald Faison?

52:51.040 --> 52:55.360
A Donald Faison, I think perfectly fits this mold of somebody you recognize.

52:55.360 --> 52:58.160
You're not sure what probably dating some sort of celeb,

52:58.160 --> 53:00.160
probably got like a bungalow somewhere.

53:00.960 --> 53:02.880
And you say, I love his work.

53:02.880 --> 53:04.240
Do I go talk to Faison?

53:04.240 --> 53:06.160
He seems fucking super friendly.

53:06.160 --> 53:12.320
I cannot imagine a reality in which I would not be more stoked to meet Donald Faison.

53:12.320 --> 53:15.680
I cannot think of an actress I would be more stoked to meet than Donald Faison.

53:15.680 --> 53:20.080
I can't think of a person I'd rather get a hang on with than Donald Faison.

53:20.080 --> 53:21.200
Seriously, that's what I'm saying.

53:21.200 --> 53:24.240
He seems like the chillest, best guy ever.

53:24.240 --> 53:26.880
Because we are the real American mold.

53:26.880 --> 53:27.360
We're nervous.

53:27.360 --> 53:27.920
We wouldn't talk.

53:27.920 --> 53:28.320
We're shy.

53:28.320 --> 53:30.080
We understand these social norms.

53:30.080 --> 53:37.120
But that Faison is such a honeypot, such a sweet, sweet honeypot.

53:37.120 --> 53:38.720
And you just want to Faison it.

53:39.280 --> 53:40.240
Here's the thing.

53:40.240 --> 53:46.240
Okay, so while I agree with you that we are a perfect, perfect slice of real America,

53:46.960 --> 53:51.440
I try to, when I am faced with decisions like this and circumstances like this,

53:51.440 --> 53:57.600
the way I think about it is, in 10 years, will I more regret embarrassing myself

53:57.600 --> 53:59.360
by talking to this person?

53:59.360 --> 54:03.200
Donald Faison, we don't have to be, we don't have to be obtuse about it anymore.

54:03.200 --> 54:04.640
It's Donald fucking Faison.

54:04.640 --> 54:09.040
Would I, will I look back and be like, man, really glad I didn't embarrass myself

54:09.040 --> 54:11.120
by talking to Donald Faison or will I say-

54:11.120 --> 54:11.680
Faison.

54:11.680 --> 54:13.760
Yeah, I fucking met Donald Faison.

54:13.760 --> 54:16.000
I talked to him and like, we ended up hanging out.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.440
We played Call of Duty together.

54:17.440 --> 54:18.160
It was super chill.

54:18.160 --> 54:18.720
Why did you play Call of Duty?

54:18.720 --> 54:20.320
We came over for pizza a couple of times.

54:20.320 --> 54:20.560
Yeah.

54:21.120 --> 54:22.400
He ended up being best friends.

54:22.400 --> 54:24.240
How do you make new friends with Donald Faison?

54:24.240 --> 54:29.760
Not to exclusively talk about scrubs, but I do want to supplement this,

54:30.480 --> 54:35.440
this tale with a personal sort of warning from my own life.

54:36.080 --> 54:42.000
I was at LAX last E3, not this E3, but the E3 before.

54:42.000 --> 54:47.680
I was at LAX and I saw John C. Reilly in the security line like-

54:47.680 --> 54:48.000
Fuck.

54:48.000 --> 54:52.000
Of course, looking like so dope, had a guitar case,

54:52.000 --> 54:55.120
had like the dopest look for his whole steez.

54:55.680 --> 55:00.000
His whole thing was like he had a cool hat and he had a cool look

55:00.000 --> 55:01.120
and he had such a cool look.

55:01.920 --> 55:04.240
I saw him, identified him.

55:04.240 --> 55:05.520
That's Mr. Cellophane.

55:05.520 --> 55:06.400
That's my guy.

55:06.400 --> 55:07.440
That's Steve Rule.

55:07.440 --> 55:08.240
That's my dude.

55:10.000 --> 55:16.560
But in my head, the name I had attached to him is John C. McGinley.

55:17.200 --> 55:18.640
No, Justin.

55:18.640 --> 55:20.080
Now, hear me out.

55:20.080 --> 55:22.160
I didn't go talk to him.

55:22.880 --> 55:27.280
I saw him at the ATM after the line and was literally a hair's breath away

55:27.280 --> 55:28.000
from saying,

55:28.800 --> 55:30.480
uh, hi, Mr. McGinley.

55:30.480 --> 55:31.920
I'm a big fan of your work.

55:31.920 --> 55:36.320
So fucked because I was literally in Charlotte before I was like,

55:36.320 --> 55:38.480
Oh God, that was John C. Reilly.

55:38.480 --> 55:41.920
That was not John C. McGinley from scrubs.

55:41.920 --> 55:43.360
Do you know why you didn't act on that?

55:43.360 --> 55:46.640
And I think it's the, I think this is the most important factor

55:46.640 --> 55:48.160
in these types of decisions.

55:48.160 --> 55:53.440
You had, it is a biblical concept, which is appropriate.

55:53.440 --> 55:55.680
You had mustard seed faith.

55:55.680 --> 56:00.720
You had a mustard seed sized faith that you were a dumb shit.

56:01.360 --> 56:04.320
You had, you would, there was a doubt, a small grain of doubt.

56:04.320 --> 56:04.880
And you acted.

56:04.880 --> 56:06.480
And you walked on the water and ran away.

56:06.480 --> 56:08.000
You had acted on that doubt.

56:08.000 --> 56:12.000
And you said, I, there's a, there's a 0.01% chance I could be wrong.

56:12.000 --> 56:16.160
That is the core of social anxiety is that somewhere deep down in you,

56:16.160 --> 56:20.320
deeper than all your other secrets, you have a suspicion,

56:20.320 --> 56:23.360
bordering on certainty that you are a dumb shit.

56:24.080 --> 56:25.680
Yeah, that's the core of it.

56:25.680 --> 56:27.200
But okay, but okay.

56:28.560 --> 56:31.760
I hope that this helps the person asking this question,

56:31.760 --> 56:34.480
but I look at it this way from my point of view.

56:34.480 --> 56:36.320
This isn't like they're out today.

56:36.320 --> 56:40.480
They're not like at a, you know, opening or something in which they are

56:40.480 --> 56:42.800
characterized as fancy star person.

56:42.800 --> 56:44.880
They're in their home, just being a regular person.

56:44.880 --> 56:47.200
If you run into them, don't acknowledge it.

56:47.200 --> 56:48.480
Just treat them like a regular person.

56:48.480 --> 56:50.080
Treat them like you would anyone else.

56:50.080 --> 56:50.320
Yeah.

56:50.320 --> 56:51.760
Have a party, have a party.

56:51.760 --> 56:52.320
This is what you do.

56:52.320 --> 56:54.960
You have a house party or a bungalow party.

56:54.960 --> 56:55.760
You knock on the door.

56:55.760 --> 56:58.080
Hey, I'm just want to let you know, we're going to have a party tonight.

56:58.080 --> 56:59.440
We'll be done before 11.

56:59.440 --> 57:00.960
So we're not going to go too late and be too loud.

57:00.960 --> 57:03.840
But by the way, we're going to have we're going to have nachos.

57:03.840 --> 57:04.640
It's a nacho part.

57:04.640 --> 57:06.320
It's a fast and the furious party.

57:06.320 --> 57:12.400
So Donald, if, if if you and your, your wife, Casey Cobb want to swing by,

57:12.400 --> 57:14.240
this is wife's name, according to INDB.

57:14.240 --> 57:17.120
Then we would love to have you.

57:17.120 --> 57:18.960
We'd love to hear some stories on the set.

57:18.960 --> 57:21.520
Would love to hear what it's like to work with John C. Reilly.

57:21.520 --> 57:24.080
Anyway, that's just the invitation.

57:24.080 --> 57:24.880
Just putting it out there.

57:24.880 --> 57:27.520
It was nice to meet you, Donald Faison.

57:28.080 --> 57:31.840
I have a, I would like to suggest this.

57:32.480 --> 57:36.560
This person has to, the actress and, and I guess to some extent,

57:36.560 --> 57:38.240
the actor who seems to be less well known.

57:38.240 --> 57:45.040
But I think that it's different because you live so close to them.

57:45.760 --> 57:49.040
I think that the best thing that you can do if you,

57:49.040 --> 57:54.400
if you really care is to ignore them because they go around being recognized

57:54.400 --> 57:57.600
and like they're in their day to day life constantly and their,

57:57.600 --> 58:03.200
their home should be a sanctuary from that, I think.

58:03.200 --> 58:07.840
And I think the best thing you could do is just give them privacy and not try to like,

58:07.840 --> 58:12.800
I mean, if you see them, but like, I don't try to establish a connection.

58:12.800 --> 58:14.400
You don't need to don't kick in the door.

58:14.400 --> 58:17.920
Don't slide notes underneath there.

58:20.800 --> 58:21.520
Big fan.

58:21.520 --> 58:23.280
Justin, I'm not saying that when you see them,

58:23.280 --> 58:26.000
you start snapping pictures and go, Oh my God, Oh my God, Oh my God.

58:26.000 --> 58:26.480
And faint.

58:26.480 --> 58:30.720
I'm saying like, imagine that they were just a normal person

58:30.720 --> 58:34.560
who moved across the hallway and then follow your behavior appropriate.

58:34.560 --> 58:36.480
There's no reason to ignore them.

58:36.480 --> 58:38.960
Draco Travis, these are one in the same.

58:38.960 --> 58:39.680
These are twain.

58:40.960 --> 58:43.040
My normal behavior would be to ignore them.

58:43.040 --> 58:44.240
My neighbor mowed my lawn.

58:44.240 --> 58:45.760
You should totally treat them like that.

58:47.120 --> 58:48.080
I don't, I'm saying that.

58:48.080 --> 58:50.400
I don't think when you run into Donald Faison in the hallway,

58:50.400 --> 58:53.040
you have to avert your eyes and say, I'm sorry.

58:53.040 --> 58:53.440
I looked at you.

58:53.440 --> 58:55.360
Mr. Faison, I'm sorry.

58:57.040 --> 58:59.280
Oh, you burned, you burned my retinas.

58:59.280 --> 59:00.560
You're so beautiful.

59:00.560 --> 59:01.120
I should.

59:01.120 --> 59:02.640
May I touch the hem of your garment?

59:02.640 --> 59:04.000
Please, please, Mr. Faison.

59:04.000 --> 59:04.640
Am I worthy?

59:04.640 --> 59:07.280
Um, which I was here, it opens in theaters July 18th.

59:07.280 --> 59:08.880
This is a new picture from Zach Braff.

59:08.880 --> 59:10.640
It does have Donald Faison in it.

59:10.640 --> 59:11.360
They're buddies in real life.

59:11.360 --> 59:13.200
Getting it back together.

59:14.080 --> 59:15.440
Oh, they're the next ones though.

59:15.440 --> 59:15.760
Shit.

59:15.760 --> 59:19.200
Which one's God going to take this, this friendship, this,

59:19.200 --> 59:21.120
this cinematic friendship is too beautiful.

59:21.120 --> 59:22.000
I know who I'm pulling for, but I don't want to say it.

59:22.720 --> 59:23.600
It's Zach Braff, right?

59:24.400 --> 59:25.200
I didn't want to say it.

59:26.800 --> 59:31.840
I hope he does first before Faison and not because I hate Zach Braff.

59:31.840 --> 59:33.200
I think he's wonderful.

59:33.200 --> 59:36.640
Um, I just, I like Donald Faison more, I guess.

59:37.200 --> 59:41.520
Um, guys, I know that I don't, uh, I kept this as a surprise for you.

59:42.240 --> 59:44.240
I know, I know I don't prep for the show.

59:45.040 --> 59:46.240
I don't, I'm not the one who-

59:46.240 --> 59:47.520
That's not a surprise.

59:47.520 --> 59:47.760
Okay.

59:48.720 --> 59:53.280
I don't prep for the show, but I did prep for this episode.

59:53.280 --> 59:59.200
I brought a special news story that I saw on CNN this morning when I was going over, uh,

59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.000
my headlines.

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:02.640
I have a, and this is, this is-

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:07.200
Is it, is it, if you were sending this in an email to us, would it be re-Donald Faison?

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:11.520
No, there's no Donald Faison connection, but I think it is a story that you will, uh,

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:12.400
very much enjoy.

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:17.200
It is a, I'm going to tell you the headline and then we are going to see how long we can

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:20.960
read details and it remains funny, but here is the headline.

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:21.520
Are you ready?

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:22.960
I guess.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:26.800
Are you sure?

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.400
I'm not sure because I know nothing about the scenario that you've-

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.640
Here is the headline on CNN.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:33.600
Okay.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.720
Cake boss gets lost in layer of fog.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:47.920
Cake boss and friends lost in layer of fog.

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:55.040
Buddy cake boss Valisotra's gastronomical gifts were of little help when his 32 foot

01:00:55.040 --> 01:01:00.720
Boston Whaler got lost in heavy fog in New York Harbor.

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:04.960
People were scared, cake boss told CNN of the harrowing journey Friday night with his

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:05.760
wife, another couple-

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:08.000
CNN, that's not how you credit a person.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.960
I, I'm sorry, that was my, that was my editorial.

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.640
That was your attribution, okay.

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.640
I mean, it is easier to say than his last thing.

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:18.800
People were scared, cake boss told CNN of the harrowing journey Friday night with his

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:19.840
wife, another couple of-

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.840
The frosting on the boat started to melt off.

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:23.840
I didn't know which way to look.

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.440
Left, right.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.120
I couldn't even see in front of me.

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.080
That's how fog do.

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:31.920
And then an angel appeared.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:38.720
I can't see the city, said cake boss, who owned a boat for six years.

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:40.080
I'm thinking it's dark.

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:43.760
We wind up going into this deep, deep fog where you couldn't see 10 feet in front of

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:44.240
you.

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.680
We started to get really scared.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:49.280
That's how he, he lost his mind on the boat.

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:52.560
He left a piece of himself out in the Atlantic, right?

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:55.680
And he was just like saying to his friend, he was like, somebody else had to take the

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:58.480
wheel from him because he was like one of those captains that loses their mind and just

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.560
like points their boat to the nearest rock.

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:02.160
Like, here's where our souls are going.

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.760
And he was just rocking back and forth, just saying, I can't see my city.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.800
I can't see my, I can't see my city.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:10.000
Okay.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.240
Cake, cake boss can't see the city.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:21.680
Just to put a capper on this, cake boss said a fire department vessel responded about 10

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:24.720
minutes after his distress call followed later by a police boat.

01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.000
I want to bake them a cake.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.640
He said, I want to do something good for them.

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:29.520
It's all I know.

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:32.080
He didn't even realize who I was until the end.

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.200
It was all business.

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:36.080
I'm not the kind of guy to say I'm the cake boss.

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:36.560
The cake boss.

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:40.080
You have to keep, keep me alive before everyone else.

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:41.360
I'm the cake boss.

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.680
The cake boss in distress made it.

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:52.240
They found him on a boat, a raft made of the human bodies of his friends that he took out.

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.760
He was lashed to the wheel.

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:54.080
Right.

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:56.160
Oh Jesus.

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.320
He said, my wife was flipping.

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:03.680
I couldn't pick a worse bunch of people to be on the boat stuck in the fog with.

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:07.120
Nobody kept their head on a swivel.

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:12.080
So just to be clear, if cake boss is ever in an emergency situation, the people he

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.800
definitely doesn't want there are his wife and his children.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.120
So that's our news segment.

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.520
I was so excited.

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:23.440
Can I tell you something?

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:28.000
I was, I was, I was disappointed when I found out a boat was involved.

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:34.160
I had envisioned maybe a thick fog, maybe landed on the lower east side.

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:36.480
And he was like, wait, what the wait, fuck.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.960
Am I in fourth now or oh fuck.

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:39.600
Oh fuck.

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.680
I can't see my city.

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:45.200
Cake boss, Mayday, cake boss in distress.

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:46.560
Oh man.

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:47.600
So anyway, that's our show.

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.520
My brother, my brother made it's an advice show or whatever.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.040
We hope you've had a lot of fun.

01:03:53.920 --> 01:04:01.440
We have an exciting, exciting, I guess, announcement, I guess.

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:02.480
I don't know if it's announcement.

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:02.720
Yeah.

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:04.560
Of the Gespert?

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:06.320
Yeah, we have a new Gespert coming up.

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.280
Donald Faison.

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:09.520
We're going to record this in a week.

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:14.320
So you have a week to submit questions to us for this Gespert.

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:20.880
You can send them to mbmbam at maximumfun.org and just put Gespert in the subject line.

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:30.000
Our guest is Elizabeth Gilbert, the author of Eat, Pray, Love and the Signature of All Things.

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:35.360
Like a real, she's like, that's a real ass awesome person.

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:43.760
She wrote my favorite book that I've read in like years, and she's going to be on the show.

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:45.840
So that's kind of crazy.

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:47.280
Here's OK.

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:51.840
She threw out a bunch of different subjects on which she could Gespert.

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:55.520
And here's some of my favorites books, getting them written.

01:04:55.520 --> 01:05:01.840
Clests, basic creative encouragement, general goats, their lore and care.

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:05.040
Public speaking, 19th century botanical exploration.

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:07.600
OK, moving from town to town for no particular reason.

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:08.160
We got that one.

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:10.000
Yeah, optimism.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:10.960
We already did that one.

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:12.560
Yeah, we've got that.

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:17.760
All due respect, Elizabeth Gilbert, we have got movie town to town for no particular reason covered.

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:22.560
I would say maybe books, maybe books and goats.

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:26.480
I say use any of those like any, whatever you want.

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:28.400
Have a question for Elizabeth Gilbert.

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:36.000
Elizabeth Gilbert, she is a listener to our show for reasons that defy explanation.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.480
And she's going to be here with us.

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:39.360
So that's awesome.

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:47.120
What if the three of us, it's probably because the three of us each represent one of the ideals

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:48.560
in the Eat, Pray, Love trifecta.

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:49.840
Oh God, I'm eat, aren't I?

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:52.080
Yeah, you're totally, totally eat.

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:55.120
Justin, I think you're love and that leaves me with pray, which that leaves me with pray,

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:57.360
which makes I think makes a lot of sense.

01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:59.360
Yeah, you're a very godly man.

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:02.400
Travis, I've been seeing some action on our YouTube channel.

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:03.120
Can you fill me in?

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:04.720
That's correct.

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:09.520
So, you know, we've been a little bit lazy about it and we are vowing to fix that.

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:12.000
So we've released a couple of videos just this last week.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.760
Pop up videos, I've seen people call them.

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:15.120
Pop up videos.

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:18.160
I call them fun facts for, you know, copyright reasons.

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:24.400
But friend of the show, Jeremy Frank also recorded the 930 New York City live show.

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:27.760
So we're we're releasing clips of that.

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:31.840
And in case you listen to the last one, the audio quality is better on the video.

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:35.280
You'll really enjoy it.

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:40.560
We're also doing fun facts videos, just kind of releasing old episodes with fun facts about

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:42.800
the episodes, about us and about just random things.

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:44.400
So go check it out.

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.440
Go to our YouTube channel, MPMBAM.

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:50.240
Make sure you subscribe and then tell all your friends about it.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.200
You know, hopefully everyone will like it.

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:57.520
And with the fun facts, it should be an easy way to get people who maybe don't listen to

01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:57.760
podcast.

01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:01.840
Yeah, we basically just want to get more full length episodes of the show on YouTube.

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:06.000
Just like make it as easy as possible for people to listen to it, however the hell they want.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.840
Because you can share it at a specific point, too.

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:09.520
So if there's a specific event on one of those.

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:10.960
We actually, it'd be great.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.480
What we need to do is time code those.

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:13.440
I know.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.280
Well, we had the Wiki project.

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.080
Well, I mean, we didn't.

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:20.320
Somebody was working on a Wiki, but I don't think it ever reached completion.

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:22.000
Anyway, there's also the other stuff.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.640
Twitter, MPMBAM on Twitter.

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:27.760
All of our names on Twitter will get you to us.

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:31.520
Facebook fan page has been popping off lately.

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:35.360
And the appreciation group, I'm sorry, has also been popping off.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.440
You can find those.

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:40.880
Appreciation group, you have to request permission to join.

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:43.360
It's how we keep them spammers and haters out.

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:46.320
But we're usually pretty quick to admit people.

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:50.960
And am I forgetting any other social channel?

01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:56.560
Well, I mean, our greatest source of publicity, our biggest advertisement is you listeners.

01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:01.520
So, I mean, can we say our only advertiser, like we don't, our only advertiser is you.

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:04.560
So if you like the show and you've got a friend that you think would like it,

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:07.680
tell them about it, burn them a desk, send them a link, get them to listen to it.

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:08.720
Because that's the only way.

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:13.200
And you guys, I mean, really, we've grown over the years because of you guys and you've been awesome.

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:16.800
We haven't spent a red cent on advertising.

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:19.120
It's been, it's been fully grassroots.

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:20.800
And we don't thank you guys enough for that.

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:21.120
Thank you.

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:21.440
Thank you.

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:21.680
Thank you.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:21.920
Thank you.

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:22.160
Thank you.

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:22.480
Thank you.

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:23.280
We love you.

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:24.320
We love you very much.

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:28.880
Thank you to John Roderick and the long winters for the use of our theme song.

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:31.360
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:33.920
He was a recent guest on our show.

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:34.880
He's fucking fantastic.

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:38.960
You can also listen to him on Roderick on the line with Berlin man, another terrific podcast.

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:42.480
Speaking of terrific podcast, there's a lot on the maximum fun network you should be listening to.

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:47.280
Bullseye, Jordan, Jesse go, judge, John Hodgman, stop podcasting yourself, throwing shade.

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:53.600
Oh no, Ross and Carrie, the goose down, one bad mother, lady to lady, song, exploder, risk.

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.440
There's a fucking, there's a crazy.

01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:56.000
Wow, really?

01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:58.000
Oh yeah.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:58.480
Saw bones.

01:08:58.480 --> 01:08:58.960
Thank you.

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:04.320
I'm, you know, I just figure every, I mean, I, you did every other show on the goddamn network.

01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:05.040
I look at your,

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:09.280
it's just an hour long commercial for solve, right? That's what I'm saying. I look at your

01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:11.040
download. I'm only talking when I posted it.

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:15.760
So when I post you like one third of this episode, you will like one half of the solve.

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:17.680
I'm saying your show is as big as ours.

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:20.560
Now I'm saying everybody who's listening to the show is already listening to your show.

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:23.200
I bet I don't, I don't know that's accurate.

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:26.160
I'll see you're looking at also a special thing in our download numbers.

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:27.360
Yeah.

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:29.840
