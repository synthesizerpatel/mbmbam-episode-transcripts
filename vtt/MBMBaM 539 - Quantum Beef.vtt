00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:49.920
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the

00:49.920 --> 00:56.320
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

00:56.320 --> 01:04.080
It's like, anytime he talks different from how he normally talks, it's like I can feel my Jeep I'm

01:04.080 --> 01:12.080
driving rolling backwards into bit country. But this is Griffin McElroy. Hey Trav, what seems-

01:12.080 --> 01:14.880
The back tires are just spinning, Griff, we gotta get the hell out of here!

01:14.880 --> 01:16.160
What's the matter, Travy?

01:16.800 --> 01:20.400
I mean, it's not really a bit, I just, can I be-

01:20.400 --> 01:24.240
That always means it's a bit! All day I'm Griffin, you gotta give a little more gas,

01:24.240 --> 01:28.240
partner, come on! Well, it's just, you know, it's a difficult time of year,

01:28.240 --> 01:33.920
and you know, there's a lot of emotions at play, and can I talk to you guys about something kind of

01:34.480 --> 01:36.960
real honest? Something real? Something real?

01:38.000 --> 01:43.440
Griffin, I warn you, he is using the faux sincere tone. This is always a recipe for disaster.

01:43.440 --> 01:45.440
We gotta get out of here, find those keys!

01:45.440 --> 01:48.800
I just, I forgot to put the damn snow tires on, but yeah-

01:48.800 --> 01:49.680
Damn, we're trapped!

01:49.680 --> 01:50.560
All right, Trav-

01:50.560 --> 01:52.240
Quick, just acknowledge what he said, Griffin!

01:52.240 --> 01:56.480
All right, Trav, tell us on our comedy podcast what's really making you very sad right now.

01:56.480 --> 02:02.640
Do you guys think, and I just, I really appreciate you guys letting me be vulnerable like this,

02:03.360 --> 02:09.760
do you guys think that in the end, the Bumble and Yukon Cornelius end up together?

02:11.360 --> 02:13.280
Now that's something to talk about, isn't it?

02:14.720 --> 02:17.040
That's something worth ta- Now that's something worth talking about.

02:17.040 --> 02:19.520
I don't know why that would make our brothers so sad.

02:19.520 --> 02:23.920
Well, because I'm just worried that they don't, that they don't end up together and that

02:23.920 --> 02:26.400
they just don't find love in a hopeless place.

02:27.440 --> 02:31.680
I'm in a hopeless place right now, pretty far from love and the light of the Lord,

02:31.680 --> 02:34.880
but I don't know that they end up together, Travis.

02:34.880 --> 02:40.160
Because I'll be honest, I don't think those two are attracted to each other sexually or romantically.

02:40.160 --> 02:45.200
You don't get a whiff of that when he says Bumble's bounce, that that's like a-

02:45.200 --> 02:46.400
On his, on his-

02:46.400 --> 02:51.200
Well, but I think that's more just like, they can get it, like Bumble's can get it.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.800
Bumble's can bounce, you know what I mean?

02:52.800 --> 02:53.600
Oh, I see.

02:53.600 --> 02:54.560
That slang you've invented.

02:54.560 --> 02:55.760
I know, I like that.

02:55.760 --> 02:59.600
So I can, if, if I was talking about, if I was talking about Travis, I could just say,

02:59.600 --> 03:03.200
Travis, bounce, and you know what I, you know what that means.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.000
It would be inappropriate.

03:04.000 --> 03:04.720
Yeah, like I can get it.

03:04.720 --> 03:05.440
Right.

03:05.440 --> 03:10.560
Well, because I think it's obvious that Rudolph ends up with Clarice and that Hermey ends up with

03:10.560 --> 03:13.760
this former boss, the dude with the weird pointy goatee.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.520
Not sure I like that, but keep going.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.680
Oh, the, oh, are you kidding me?

03:17.680 --> 03:18.960
Their chemistry is obvious.

03:18.960 --> 03:20.240
That's a no brainer.

03:20.240 --> 03:26.240
And I feel like at the end, there's definitely a palpable attraction betwixt the Bumble and

03:26.240 --> 03:27.520
Yukon Cornelius.

03:28.080 --> 03:31.280
I'm just worried that societal norms might keep them apart.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.400
I think physical norms are really the, the big complicating factor here, just the size

03:38.400 --> 03:40.080
of, the size of the venture.

03:40.080 --> 03:48.240
I don't want to yuck Cornelius's yums, but I also don't want the Bumble to crush his

03:48.240 --> 03:49.760
bones by trying to bounce.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.200
Oh, the Bumble's a bottom.

03:52.320 --> 03:56.080
Okay, now this is something we can sink our teeth into.

03:56.080 --> 03:58.320
Yeah, I think Yukon would top the hell out of him.

03:59.040 --> 04:01.600
Okay, okay, cause he's got like the climbing gear.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.720
Now that makes a lot of sense actually, now that you put it that way.

04:04.720 --> 04:08.720
And also he would definitely be like the daddy in this scenario.

04:08.720 --> 04:13.600
I feel like just Yukon Cornelius has a lot of like, just a lot of power energy.

04:13.600 --> 04:14.960
He would be a power top.

04:14.960 --> 04:16.080
I don't know if that's a thing.

04:16.960 --> 04:23.120
Yeah, no, I think we all thought that when we first saw this ancient animated movie,

04:24.240 --> 04:32.320
that we saw this prospector, this silly gold obsessed sort of folk legend figure and saw

04:32.320 --> 04:34.160
him and said, I bet he could bounce a butt.

04:34.880 --> 04:38.400
Yeah, I bet he could bounce a butt.

04:38.400 --> 04:41.440
Left, right, and ever so rightly.

04:41.440 --> 04:42.400
You know what I mean?

04:42.400 --> 04:45.840
Now here's the question though, because I don't want this to skew just into the physical,

04:46.480 --> 04:48.880
because I mean, they definitely fuck.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.160
That's not what I'm worried about.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.480
I'm worried about if they end up together.

04:52.480 --> 04:55.600
Do they form a lasting romantic relationship?

04:56.240 --> 04:57.360
I don't think so, man.

04:57.360 --> 04:58.640
Tiger can't change the stripes.

04:58.640 --> 05:01.280
Like he can love Bumble, right?

05:01.280 --> 05:07.760
Yeah, and he does, but you know what's going to be, I know Bumble is his third priority.

05:07.760 --> 05:12.000
And I know what the first two are, and I'll give you a hint, is silver and gold.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.920
Yeah, that's going to be the real problem with the relationship.

05:15.920 --> 05:19.040
He's going to have to get out there during silver and gold season.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.720
The time away, the Bumble can't just sit in the cave and wait for Cornelius to come back

05:24.720 --> 05:30.400
if Cornelius comes back and doesn't fall into some sort of ice chasm.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.800
Because there's precedent for that.

05:32.800 --> 05:36.560
Can you imagine the Bumble being up all night on its little widow's perch

05:36.560 --> 05:41.200
waiting for their sea captain to return from the glaciers?

05:41.200 --> 05:42.080
No way, man.

05:42.640 --> 05:47.120
Now, could the Bumble go with Yukon Cornelius on these adventures?

05:47.120 --> 05:48.800
Oh, they tried it, didn't they?

05:48.800 --> 05:53.520
I mean, they tried it, but honestly, it's not the Bumble's passion.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.320
He doesn't love it the way that Yukon Cornelius does.

05:56.320 --> 06:04.240
I will say, I'm willing to accept that they don't stay together if they really gave it a shot.

06:04.240 --> 06:09.680
I mean, if they really tried to make it work and they communicated with one another

06:09.680 --> 06:14.640
and they put the time in and they just found that their priorities were different

06:14.640 --> 06:16.880
and they grew apart as people, I'm totally fine with that.

06:16.880 --> 06:21.200
Now, let me float this as long as we're having fun here in this safe place

06:21.200 --> 06:25.200
where we're just getting out there and just shooting out some silly string.

06:26.160 --> 06:32.960
That was an unfortunate way of saying that, but what if Cornelius ends up with Frosty,

06:32.960 --> 06:38.000
the snowman, and then it turns into less of a sexual Randy Romp,

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
like the one that Travis is floating, a sort of American Pie 4, Santa's Wonderland,

06:44.000 --> 06:50.240
and instead becomes more of a coming of age, like me, Earl, and the dying girl,

06:50.240 --> 06:54.320
but the dying girl is a snowman who comes spring, but they're very much in love

06:54.320 --> 06:57.200
and so you get a walk to remember vibes and people love that.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.560
Yeah, here's the twist though, Griffin.

07:00.560 --> 07:05.040
I think maybe they entered into the relationship and Yukon Cornelius is like,

07:05.040 --> 07:13.040
we only have these winter months, but then time passes and it's not getting any warmer

07:13.040 --> 07:17.920
and Frosty's like, well, we live, this is the North Pole, it's gonna be fine.

07:17.920 --> 07:20.320
And suddenly Yukon Cornelius is like, oh.

07:20.320 --> 07:23.120
Oh shit, I got a dip, yeah.

07:23.120 --> 07:27.760
I don't know that I, now that the timeline shifted, I don't know.

07:27.760 --> 07:31.120
I think maybe we were in this for like different things.

07:31.120 --> 07:31.840
Yeah.

07:31.840 --> 07:33.760
And I got a bounce.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.880
I'm gonna hit you guys with something that is,

07:36.880 --> 07:40.160
you're gonna, the first thing you're gonna do is laugh, but then you're gonna be like, huh?

07:41.760 --> 07:43.680
But do feel free to laugh and bust up.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.280
Okay, okay.

07:45.280 --> 07:46.560
But don't skip to the huh.

07:46.560 --> 07:56.400
Huh, if Yukon Cornelius and the Bumble found a way to conceive a child, it would be Wolverine.

07:58.560 --> 07:59.440
Walk me through that.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.640
Think about it.

08:00.640 --> 08:01.120
No.

08:01.120 --> 08:02.800
He Canadian?

08:02.800 --> 08:03.840
Uh-huh, obviously.

08:03.840 --> 08:06.640
Outdoors person, beard, hairiness.

08:06.640 --> 08:06.960
Yeah.

08:06.960 --> 08:07.920
Claws and fangs.

08:08.640 --> 08:09.040
Metal bones?

08:09.040 --> 08:09.680
You know what I mean?

08:09.680 --> 08:12.080
Metal bones?

08:12.080 --> 08:13.440
Well, he's got the ice pick, doesn't he?

08:13.440 --> 08:15.360
Yeah, it says silver and gold right there.

08:15.360 --> 08:15.680
Okay.

08:15.680 --> 08:17.600
Yep, metal in the baby's bones.

08:18.880 --> 08:25.520
Put metal in my baby's bones, paid for the whole surgery.

08:26.720 --> 08:34.080
Put metal in the bones of my baby so he can be a hero for me.

08:35.920 --> 08:40.160
So, wow, oh my God, I just looked at the, we've been doing this for eight minutes?

08:40.800 --> 08:42.720
Are you kidding me?

08:43.360 --> 08:44.160
Doesn't seem right.

08:44.160 --> 08:46.800
It feels like two and a half, but eight, I guess.

08:46.800 --> 08:47.520
All right.

08:47.520 --> 08:48.320
Flew by.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.120
Cool, it's going to be-

08:49.120 --> 08:50.400
Griffin, did you say it flew by?

08:50.400 --> 08:51.440
It flew right by.

08:52.640 --> 08:57.040
I think I could talk, we haven't even gotten to the fact that Herme rips all the teeth out

08:57.040 --> 09:01.040
of the Bumble's mouth, and the Bumble's kind of cool with it, isn't he?

09:01.040 --> 09:04.000
Yeah, well, he's into dental stuff.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
All right, it's getting bleak, so what's next?

09:08.960 --> 09:11.920
Oh, this is an advice show, obviously.

09:11.920 --> 09:16.880
And so I thought we could do, on this one, a little advice for our listeners.

09:16.880 --> 09:17.440
Are you sure?

09:17.440 --> 09:21.360
Because I got some fan theories about Christmas Carol, too, if we want to get into those.

09:21.360 --> 09:21.840
Kickass idea.

09:21.840 --> 09:23.440
Kickass audience.

09:23.440 --> 09:26.800
There has to be a portion of our audience, just the way the world works, that has not

09:26.800 --> 09:31.840
seen Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer in the past eight minutes, must have been absolutely delirious.

09:31.840 --> 09:32.240
Yeah.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.920
Must have been quite a trip.

09:34.720 --> 09:38.400
I'm betting that those people probably enjoyed it more than the other ones, though.

09:39.040 --> 09:40.800
How is that possible, though?

09:40.800 --> 09:43.440
They're going to get sent to the hospital from Olin.

09:47.280 --> 09:51.920
The last time I was at an airport, there was a caricature artist doing free portraits.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.080
I've always wanted one, so I figured, why not?

09:54.080 --> 09:54.960
I got time to kill.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.240
That's actually a really good time.

09:57.120 --> 09:57.840
Oh, yeah.

09:57.840 --> 09:59.200
That would be the moment, right?

10:00.080 --> 10:02.160
If they're on a boardwalk at the beach, no thanks.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.000
I'm having a great time with my family.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.680
But here, alone, in the Charlotte airport, as I wait for a flight, yeah, I'd love that,

10:09.680 --> 10:12.320
actually. I'd like to take a moment to be considered.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.040
I do want to say real quick, and I do want to hear the rest of the question, but

10:16.160 --> 10:20.560
if I saw a caricature artist, I would be like, I don't know that I want to pay for that.

10:20.560 --> 10:22.080
And then they'd be like, it's free.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.560
And I'd be like, well, no, I definitely don't want it.

10:24.560 --> 10:27.440
There's something about it being free that seems weird to me.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.480
If it's good, then you should charge for it.

10:30.480 --> 10:31.600
What is he charging for?

10:31.600 --> 10:32.400
How is your business model?

10:32.400 --> 10:33.120
You think it's a frame?

10:34.080 --> 10:39.120
He's like, if you want to have it, then you have to pay for it.

10:39.120 --> 10:44.720
The only other explanation is that the airport has paid the caricature artist to be there

10:44.720 --> 10:47.360
as an amenity.

10:47.360 --> 10:52.640
Or the caricature artist draws you with a grody butt, and your wiener is out.

10:52.640 --> 10:54.400
And you're like, what did you do that for?

10:54.400 --> 10:58.480
And they're like, if you want me to erase it, I got the eraser right here.

10:58.480 --> 11:01.440
But that's 50 bucks for this No PP DLC.

11:02.080 --> 11:06.880
He draws you with photorealism in a compromising position with the mayor's wife.

11:06.880 --> 11:13.280
And you don't give me $1,000 and this is going to find its way into the Inside Edition Studios.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.240
Inside Edition Studios is going to go for that, you think?

11:16.800 --> 11:17.360
Yeah.

11:17.360 --> 11:19.520
They're pretty desperate at this point.

11:19.520 --> 11:21.440
They will take a charcoal drawing.

11:21.440 --> 11:24.400
They're willing to go outside the edition at this point.

11:24.400 --> 11:28.880
They're just looking for anything that will draw the people inside the edition.

11:28.880 --> 11:31.200
Okay, there's more to say about this wonderful scenario.

11:31.200 --> 11:38.880
You know, about halfway through, he mentioned that I was the first person to stare at him

11:38.880 --> 11:39.440
while he worked.

11:40.960 --> 11:46.000
And I immediately felt super awkward and suddenly didn't know where to look or how to act.

11:46.720 --> 11:52.000
If I ever see another caricature artist, what's the proper etiquette?

11:52.000 --> 11:55.200
Should I just avoid them all together as some cartoon buffoon?

11:55.200 --> 11:56.080
You can't avoid them.

11:56.080 --> 12:01.120
Well, I've actually done a pretty good job of it my entire life.

12:01.920 --> 12:06.960
That is not true because I know for a fact that we've been to amusement parks together

12:06.960 --> 12:08.480
where they wait around every corner.

12:08.480 --> 12:13.520
You turn a corner thinking, oh, this might be like a fun vendor that sells perhaps some

12:13.520 --> 12:14.480
kind of kettle corn.

12:14.480 --> 12:19.600
Oh no, it's a caricature artist who has done a Danny Zuko.

12:19.600 --> 12:24.000
Right, but if he tries to get up, if he rolls up on me, I give him a little chin music and

12:24.000 --> 12:25.600
I just keep on trucking.

12:25.600 --> 12:31.360
You got to, or I'll say we'll pin you to the ground and draw you in a crazy way that I

12:31.360 --> 12:32.560
don't appreciate.

12:32.560 --> 12:35.440
So sometimes you got to give him a little buff, buffo, buff.

12:36.160 --> 12:44.000
I would say, dear listener, that you have found apparently one of the very, very few

12:44.000 --> 12:46.720
ways there is to genuinely screw up this interaction.

12:46.720 --> 12:52.720
And I would not trust you, you being who you are with your track record, I would not trust

12:52.720 --> 12:54.240
you with another caricature artist.

12:54.240 --> 12:58.400
I don't think they, it's a small community, first off, you know what I mean?

12:58.960 --> 13:00.560
Small community, they talk.

13:00.560 --> 13:01.360
Yeah, they've talked.

13:01.360 --> 13:01.760
They know.

13:01.760 --> 13:02.320
They talked.

13:02.320 --> 13:03.040
They know about you.

13:03.040 --> 13:04.640
They got an eye out for you.

13:04.640 --> 13:16.000
Why on fuck would your choice be to stare dead eye, just stare down this person doing

13:16.000 --> 13:16.960
a caricature of you?

13:16.960 --> 13:18.480
Oh, I'm sorry, Justin.

13:18.480 --> 13:23.520
A little thing called the Mona Lisa, like a piece of art where you're looking dead at

13:23.520 --> 13:24.560
the artist, like.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.360
No, no, no, no, no.

13:27.360 --> 13:31.760
There is every portrait like that where it's like staring out at the viewer.

13:32.480 --> 13:34.480
They have you look at the last second.

13:35.280 --> 13:36.960
It's like five minutes before they're done.

13:36.960 --> 13:38.080
They're like, okay, go ahead.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.320
And go ahead and look at me, Mona.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.120
Thank you.

13:41.120 --> 13:41.600
Thank you.

13:41.600 --> 13:44.080
Okay, okay, okay, look away, look away, look away.

13:45.120 --> 13:49.360
I'm just, I, okay, it's not what I would do.

13:49.360 --> 13:54.800
Yeah, but I can see where you're looking in the direction of the person rather than

13:54.800 --> 14:01.200
pretending they're not there could arguably seem like the least awkward.

14:01.200 --> 14:06.800
Now, I will say from a different point of view, why, what do you think was going through

14:06.800 --> 14:13.520
the caricature artist's head that they felt the need to say you're the first person to

14:13.520 --> 14:15.760
ever stare at me while I do this?

14:15.760 --> 14:18.400
Yeah, and maybe it's their like sixth one ever.

14:18.400 --> 14:21.440
Like no one actually takes me up on this.

14:21.440 --> 14:23.040
That's why I'm doing it for free.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.400
I'm still learning.

14:24.400 --> 14:27.120
Yeah, this is a, I'm in my residence.

14:27.120 --> 14:29.040
I'm actually not a caricature artist.

14:29.040 --> 14:33.040
I'm just waiting for a flight and I had a pad and I was bored.

14:33.840 --> 14:41.120
If I was getting my portrait done by a caricature artist, I would be too preoccupied with which

14:41.120 --> 14:46.160
of my zany features are they gonna pop off, you know what I mean?

14:46.160 --> 14:53.040
I assume it's my massive pecs or maybe my delts or these glutes.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.480
It's never a good one.

14:54.480 --> 14:59.440
No one's ever looked at a caricature of themselves and been like, yeah, actually.

15:00.240 --> 15:03.280
Yeah, actually, hello new Bumble profile picture.

15:03.280 --> 15:04.880
It's not anything good ever.

15:04.880 --> 15:09.680
It's like, you know, here's my Austin Powers teeth that have been made big like a donkey's

15:09.680 --> 15:10.400
teeth.

15:10.400 --> 15:10.960
You know what I mean?

15:10.960 --> 15:13.440
Even like a Hirschfeld like looks wild.

15:13.440 --> 15:14.720
It's like a wild.

15:14.720 --> 15:16.080
What do you think your guys would be?

15:16.080 --> 15:23.600
Because I think in a good outcome, I've got a big pomp of purple hair on top of my head.

15:23.600 --> 15:29.280
But realistically, it's that I have a giant head is probably what the thing is.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.640
But that's a lot of caricatures, right?

15:32.640 --> 15:35.120
Big head seems to be a pretty common one.

15:37.680 --> 15:43.440
I don't, I just, you don't have to do, they don't, they can't make you let them draw you.

15:43.440 --> 15:44.720
There is nowhere to look.

15:44.720 --> 15:47.680
I'm I've been thinking about it for six minutes now.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.760
There's nowhere to look except at your phone.

15:50.640 --> 15:53.440
I don't really think I don't really think they need to take you.

15:53.440 --> 15:57.920
I don't think they need to drink you in for the art necessarily.

15:57.920 --> 16:02.880
I think they just need to spot your one flaw and then make it a big cartoon that makes

16:02.880 --> 16:05.520
you look like just a real idiot.

16:06.400 --> 16:11.920
Hey, I can't stop thinking about the fact that this person has gone through extensive

16:11.920 --> 16:17.840
security background checks to sit in the middle of this airport to do caricatures.

16:17.840 --> 16:21.920
Yeah, what's, oh, actually this email is from 1998.

16:21.920 --> 16:27.440
So back when you could just walk through and have a fun, have a fun time.

16:27.440 --> 16:31.120
You could just say, I'm picking someone up from the airport.

16:31.120 --> 16:34.640
My favorite restaurant used to be the airport Chili's.

16:34.640 --> 16:39.840
But then, you know, then, you know, and then I couldn't go anymore.

16:39.840 --> 16:46.640
I like when caricature artists, Travis mentioned Danny Zuko and it made me think about how

16:47.520 --> 16:55.920
most caricature artists always have like several caricatures around to their station to like

16:57.120 --> 17:00.720
show you their skills, you know.

17:00.720 --> 17:07.680
And when I was younger, by which I mean in my mid to late 30s, I used to think that they

17:07.680 --> 17:10.000
were there, they were, those were for sale too.

17:10.560 --> 17:14.560
Like maybe you just be like, oh shit, is this Michael Keaton going home?

17:14.560 --> 17:15.600
That's fucking cool.

17:16.400 --> 17:17.440
I love that.

17:17.440 --> 17:21.440
I have to imagine if you walked up and you're like, I'll take the Terminator one.

17:21.440 --> 17:22.880
It would be gized about that.

17:22.880 --> 17:24.080
The work's already done.

17:24.080 --> 17:28.480
Now the fucking power play is just while they're doing a caricature of someone else in the

17:28.480 --> 17:32.800
moment be like $500 and then you take it and walk away.

17:32.800 --> 17:33.920
No questions asked.

17:33.920 --> 17:37.120
This one's, this one's going in the vault.

17:37.120 --> 17:39.600
Can you give me a Terminator?

17:39.600 --> 17:42.880
Can you make me a Terminator with the face and what all and the leather jacket and I'll

17:42.880 --> 17:43.280
be back.

17:43.280 --> 17:48.160
Can you actually just add me to the Terminator one so it looks like Arnold and I sat together?

17:48.160 --> 17:54.080
Can you do one where it's mainly Arnold and there's a long line of people waiting to meet

17:54.080 --> 17:57.040
him and I'm like 30 in the back.

17:57.040 --> 18:00.800
And I don't want the focus, but I do want it to be obvious it's me.

18:00.800 --> 18:05.600
I want people to believe I met him and that seems believable that I met him when he was

18:05.600 --> 18:06.000
a caricature.

18:06.000 --> 18:11.360
And no one had a phone or a camera or anything and the only option to capture the moment

18:11.360 --> 18:12.400
was caricature.

18:13.360 --> 18:18.000
Hey, can you do a caricature of this receipt so I don't have to, I don't have a scanner

18:18.000 --> 18:21.120
on me and I do want to prove to my employer that I made this purchase.

18:21.120 --> 18:21.520
Yeah.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.280
So could you do a caricature of my receipt?

18:23.280 --> 18:25.520
Why did you make all the fives super big?

18:26.480 --> 18:27.360
You goofball.

18:27.920 --> 18:28.960
Hey, how about a Yahoo?

18:28.960 --> 18:31.680
Yeah, I'd love that Griff, thank you bud.

18:32.240 --> 18:33.360
Hey man, you're welcome.

18:34.160 --> 18:38.640
You know, hey, real quick, if you ever want to fake being in a relationship, having a

18:38.640 --> 18:44.400
caricature artist draw you with some made up person, there's no reason anyone would

18:44.400 --> 18:45.920
do that if it wasn't true.

18:45.920 --> 18:47.680
I think that would be very convincing.

18:48.240 --> 18:49.360
Yeah, probably.

18:49.360 --> 18:51.360
This was sent in by several people, thanks everybody.

18:51.360 --> 18:52.800
Trying to prove a Canadian girlfriend?

18:52.800 --> 18:53.120
Yeah.

18:53.120 --> 18:55.600
Just, oh yeah, yeah, we had this done at the boardwalk.

18:55.600 --> 18:59.680
Or if you're trying to prove like some kind of physics theory, that would also work I

18:59.680 --> 19:01.520
think, have a caricature artist draw it.

19:03.120 --> 19:05.120
Sarah asks a question.

19:05.120 --> 19:09.600
She says, can you ask fast food restaurants to heat up sauces?

19:10.480 --> 19:13.200
You know those little pots of sauces they give you at McDonald's?

19:13.200 --> 19:15.280
If you ask them to heat it up, would they?

19:15.280 --> 19:19.920
I'm really picky when it comes to sauces and I hate cold slash warm sauces on hot food.

19:19.920 --> 19:23.600
Like if you go through a drive through and ask any fast food chain, would they?

19:23.600 --> 19:26.000
Any fast food?

19:26.000 --> 19:26.480
No.

19:26.480 --> 19:27.760
Not any fast food chain.

19:27.760 --> 19:28.000
No.

19:28.000 --> 19:28.560
Not any fast food chain.

19:28.560 --> 19:32.000
There are definitely some, and we don't need to name them, but they would say no.

19:32.640 --> 19:33.280
Yeah.

19:33.280 --> 19:36.960
But there are some that I think would be super jive to say yes.

19:36.960 --> 19:39.680
And I will say though, I think the drive through is out.

19:39.680 --> 19:41.440
I think that has to be counter.

19:41.440 --> 19:42.720
The drive through is too far.

19:42.720 --> 19:42.960
Right.

19:42.960 --> 19:45.760
There's other people that have other things they need to do in there, okay?

19:45.760 --> 19:46.240
Okay.

19:46.240 --> 19:46.960
Yes.

19:46.960 --> 19:47.360
Is it?

19:47.360 --> 19:49.520
But that's the only thing I do it though.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.280
And I do want hot ketchup.

19:51.280 --> 19:51.600
So.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.040
Well then you're not getting it.

19:53.040 --> 19:53.920
I mean, if you want.

19:53.920 --> 19:55.840
But I want it.

19:56.480 --> 19:59.760
If you, then you need to put a microwave in your car like any normal person.

19:59.760 --> 20:00.240
But if you want to go.

20:00.240 --> 20:03.680
I tried that, but I fucking traveled back in time, didn't I?

20:03.680 --> 20:04.720
Well, that'll happen.

20:05.440 --> 20:06.400
That will happen.

20:06.400 --> 20:10.000
Just trying to make, just trying to make some bagel bites.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.240
I am going to the caveman times.

20:12.240 --> 20:13.680
And boys, let me tell you.

20:13.680 --> 20:16.320
You became a king because of the bagel bites though.

20:16.320 --> 20:16.960
No, man.

20:16.960 --> 20:19.200
I was not suited for caveman's time.

20:20.080 --> 20:20.480
Bummer.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.640
Bummer, they got big tigers.

20:23.840 --> 20:26.800
But if you want to get them warm sauces, you've got to go the extra mile.

20:26.800 --> 20:29.920
By which I mean talking to someone face to face inside a building.

20:30.480 --> 20:30.960
Right.

20:31.600 --> 20:34.400
I mean, this would be fixed if it just became sort of standard practice.

20:34.400 --> 20:39.760
And listen, and this is, I could train my local McDonald's by going through and saying,

20:39.760 --> 20:40.880
I would like hot ketchup.

20:40.880 --> 20:42.320
And they would say, we don't have that.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.200
And then I would leave.

20:43.200 --> 20:47.600
And then the next 15 times I drove through, I would say, hello, how's that hot ketchup coming?

20:47.600 --> 20:51.840
And they would say, okay, just to satisfy you, we're going to make hot ketchup for you this

20:51.840 --> 20:52.400
one time.

20:52.400 --> 20:55.520
And they'll set up a little Bon Marie of ketchup packets.

20:55.520 --> 20:58.560
And then the next time I come through, like you still have that Bon Marie set up.

20:58.560 --> 21:00.240
And they'll be like, yeah, we do.

21:00.240 --> 21:02.000
And then it's hot ketchup city, baby.

21:02.560 --> 21:10.720
Now, but I will point out that in the question, it clarifies hot sauce on cold food and cold

21:10.720 --> 21:12.320
sauce on warm food.

21:12.320 --> 21:21.520
And then I do like, because I enjoy the different experience of like hot fries, cold ketchup.

21:21.520 --> 21:23.280
Everybody loves that, I think.

21:23.280 --> 21:25.440
Not this exact person.

21:25.440 --> 21:28.400
They said this one exact person.

21:28.400 --> 21:29.520
No, they said hot sauce.

21:29.520 --> 21:31.120
But there's a part where they say-

21:31.120 --> 21:35.040
When it comes to sauces, I hate cold slash warm sauces on hot food.

21:35.600 --> 21:36.400
That's all I said.

21:36.400 --> 21:36.880
Hot food.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.840
Oh, why would you want a hot sauce on hot food?

21:39.840 --> 21:41.360
Dude, my mom said-

21:41.360 --> 21:43.440
Hot sauce on hot food, because it's a lovely contrast.

21:43.440 --> 21:44.240
What do you mean, why?

21:44.240 --> 21:45.840
Well, then there's no contrast.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.080
I want the contrast.

21:48.080 --> 21:49.840
And I want it now.

21:49.840 --> 21:53.360
We're not litigating what this person likes and doesn't like.

21:53.360 --> 21:53.840
I am.

21:55.360 --> 21:56.160
I am.

21:56.160 --> 21:58.400
And if it pleases the court, I think it's sub.

22:01.040 --> 22:01.540
Nice.

22:01.540 --> 22:10.100
Do you guys, I would for sure run this up the ladder.

22:10.900 --> 22:13.060
I don't know what that looks like, right?

22:13.060 --> 22:14.740
Like, does it go to the king himself?

22:15.540 --> 22:17.300
It's gotta, who is it?

22:17.300 --> 22:20.740
Is it the Arby's voice that we get?

22:20.740 --> 22:23.860
I feel like if anybody's gonna do it, fucking Arby's is gonna be the one that does it.

22:23.860 --> 22:25.460
I feel like Arby's would do it.

22:25.460 --> 22:25.960
Definitely.

22:26.580 --> 22:27.080
Okay.

22:27.540 --> 22:30.020
We have the means and we're listening.

22:30.020 --> 22:30.820
We're listening.

22:30.820 --> 22:31.460
We're listening to you.

22:31.460 --> 22:32.340
We're here for you.

22:32.340 --> 22:32.900
We care.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.140
I want a warm horsey.

22:35.140 --> 22:37.540
Justin, set us free by reading another question.

22:37.540 --> 22:42.020
Well, my email tab has hung up.

22:42.020 --> 22:43.060
I mean, I've got it right here.

22:43.700 --> 22:44.200
Yeah.

22:44.980 --> 22:50.900
My mom, being careful during a pandemic, receives her groceries via curbside pickup.

22:50.900 --> 22:56.020
She recently ordered a case of diet root beer and the store gave her regular root beer by mistake.

22:57.540 --> 22:59.380
None of my family wants to drink the pop.

22:59.380 --> 23:04.900
So she said, quote, I'll leave it on the street for someone to take, end quote.

23:04.900 --> 23:08.020
I thought giving away free pop on the street was strange.

23:08.020 --> 23:11.140
Would you take free cans of pop off the street?

23:11.140 --> 23:13.780
Can anyone offer free street pop?

23:13.780 --> 23:16.580
That's for diet pop only in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

23:18.260 --> 23:20.260
I mean, absolutely not, right?

23:20.260 --> 23:22.500
I mean, there's no reality in which.

23:23.860 --> 23:26.660
I assume you threw it out for, this has gone bad.

23:26.660 --> 23:29.300
I assume it went bad, right?

23:29.300 --> 23:31.300
Well, you know what fixes this?

23:32.020 --> 23:35.540
A note, two words, free soda.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.140
Not poison.

23:37.140 --> 23:41.780
Not poison, regular root beer.

23:42.820 --> 23:43.320
Wink.

23:43.780 --> 23:44.580
Never warn.

23:45.140 --> 23:45.640
Yeah.

23:46.260 --> 23:52.900
I think that this won't work and this is, I don't know any.

23:52.900 --> 23:57.620
It depends on how busy your street is before you just say it won't work.

23:57.620 --> 24:01.380
If the street's busy enough, someone's going to take it, right?

24:01.380 --> 24:05.940
If you get a big enough selection of people, somebody's going to be like,

24:05.940 --> 24:08.500
this doesn't seem strange to me at all, right?

24:08.500 --> 24:13.300
But if you're only getting like, maybe if it's a small, a quiet suburban street and

24:13.300 --> 24:17.620
you're getting maybe 20 people a week walking, the chances that somebody's going to be like,

24:17.620 --> 24:19.540
ah, yes, just like when I was growing up.

24:19.540 --> 24:21.700
Sure.

24:21.700 --> 24:26.340
If you're on a busy enough street, it's going to vanish one can at a time.

24:26.340 --> 24:28.180
Can I float this one too?

24:28.180 --> 24:30.740
In this challenging year, and it's been hard for all of us,

24:32.180 --> 24:34.020
can she not just drink the root beer?

24:35.060 --> 24:39.940
Let's be, guys, hey, can you just roll up on your mom with this street beer and say,

24:39.940 --> 24:44.340
hey, let's be bad and just do the damn thing?

24:44.900 --> 24:46.260
No one's going to tell on you.

24:47.060 --> 24:47.560
Yeah.

24:47.560 --> 24:49.460
The FBI is not going to kick in the door.

24:49.460 --> 24:50.900
Was that regular cowry?

24:50.900 --> 24:52.820
Nah, it's 2020.

24:52.820 --> 24:54.340
And we're at the tip of it, aren't we?

24:54.340 --> 24:56.420
We're about to jump off into freedom.

24:56.420 --> 24:58.820
Because baby, 2021 looking good.

24:59.460 --> 25:01.220
Yeah, that one's going to be a good year.

25:01.220 --> 25:03.220
This one's going to be the best year yet.

25:03.220 --> 25:08.100
Because I know all the fucking bad people who've been doing bad shit to keep this

25:08.100 --> 25:11.460
beautiful nation of ours just riddled with the COVID.

25:11.460 --> 25:13.220
2021 is going to roll over.

25:13.220 --> 25:15.700
The odometer is going to tick to 2021.

25:15.700 --> 25:18.980
And they're all going to be like, eh, we did enough.

25:18.980 --> 25:20.980
And then it's money in the bank, baby.

25:21.700 --> 25:24.740
I'm just imagining it's going to be like the end of Rock-A-Doodle,

25:24.740 --> 25:27.540
when Chanticleer is going to fucking finally crow,

25:27.540 --> 25:31.540
the sun's going to rise, and all those evil owls are going to melt away to dust.

25:31.540 --> 25:35.300
We bury the dagger in the chest of 2020 and it dies,

25:35.300 --> 25:39.620
taking along all unpleasantness with it as the new beautiful-

25:39.620 --> 25:40.580
There it is.

25:40.580 --> 25:46.980
2021 cresting over the hur- what's that? An all good year?

25:46.980 --> 25:50.980
Who will be the arbiters of which unpleasant things deserve to be dusted?

25:50.980 --> 25:53.380
Why, it's the McElroy brothers, of course.

25:53.380 --> 25:56.100
We'll be deciding what is turned to dust.

25:56.100 --> 25:57.620
Who and what, I should say.

25:57.620 --> 25:59.380
Because there will definitely be some humans in there.

25:59.380 --> 26:00.500
Oh, for sure.

26:00.500 --> 26:03.060
Spoiler alert, we're cleaning house.

26:03.060 --> 26:06.020
Yes, spoiler alert, the cleansing, she is a coming.

26:06.020 --> 26:12.660
Kiss your grandma goodbye if you're not 100% sure that she is a total penis.

26:14.100 --> 26:17.140
And boy, howdy, you better be real, real certain about it.

26:17.140 --> 26:19.460
We got a fine sieve here, folks.

26:19.460 --> 26:20.740
Not a lot making it through.

26:22.100 --> 26:27.300
It's a rigorous, rigorous protocol we are applying.

26:29.460 --> 26:31.060
Just drink the fucking root beer, man.

26:31.060 --> 26:34.180
It's 2020, and we're almost done. Celebrate, pop it off.

26:34.180 --> 26:37.540
And you know what, pretty soon you're gonna have house guests again,

26:37.540 --> 26:38.900
so maybe save it for them.

26:39.540 --> 26:41.300
Because pretty soon it's all gonna be fine.

26:41.860 --> 26:43.220
Yeah, we're almost at the end.

26:44.340 --> 26:45.220
Do you want another Yahoo?

26:46.100 --> 26:49.060
Yeah, yeah, I guess, yeah, sure.

26:49.060 --> 26:51.140
This one was sent in by-

26:51.140 --> 26:52.980
Oh, it's another one that was sent in by many people.

26:52.980 --> 26:53.700
Thanks, everybody.

26:55.140 --> 26:56.260
Takes a whole village.

26:56.260 --> 26:57.140
It does.

26:57.140 --> 26:59.140
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

26:59.140 --> 27:04.740
I'm gonna call Bainer, asks,

27:04.740 --> 27:06.900
can anyone invent a new way of BBQ

27:06.900 --> 27:08.580
or have they all burn done already?

27:10.980 --> 27:13.780
And that wasn't a play on words, it was B-E-R-N.

27:15.300 --> 27:16.660
Oh, because of Bernie Sanders.

27:16.660 --> 27:19.140
Because Bernie Sanders, the fucking pit master.

27:21.220 --> 27:22.900
You know you get my man in front of the grill

27:22.900 --> 27:24.660
with a fucking high life in his hand,

27:24.660 --> 27:27.460
a high life in his left hand, spatula in the other,

27:27.460 --> 27:29.940
a fucking apron, kiss the cook.

27:29.940 --> 27:31.300
Oh my God, Bernie.

27:31.300 --> 27:33.540
You don't think his apron would say feel the burn?

27:34.340 --> 27:35.780
That would be better.

27:35.780 --> 27:37.220
It would be better.

27:37.220 --> 27:41.860
I'm again asking you to give me five more minutes

27:42.500 --> 27:43.380
on these steaks.

27:43.380 --> 27:44.100
That's good, man.

27:44.900 --> 27:45.700
Do another one, juice.

27:46.420 --> 27:46.740
Okay.

27:48.180 --> 27:50.260
And do this one less like Christopher Lloyd.

27:51.060 --> 27:53.860
Yeah, actually in the movie of Bernie's life,

27:53.860 --> 27:55.220
I cast Christopher Lloyd.

27:55.220 --> 27:56.340
Okay, that tracks.

27:56.340 --> 27:59.060
Larry David thing was too on the nose.

27:59.060 --> 27:59.300
Yes.

27:59.300 --> 28:00.820
Can anyone invent a new way of BBQ

28:00.820 --> 28:02.180
or have they all burned done already?

28:02.820 --> 28:04.660
Ceviche.

28:05.460 --> 28:06.740
Ceviche barbecue.

28:06.740 --> 28:08.900
Ceviche BBQ.

28:08.900 --> 28:10.820
Does that mean you barbecue some meat

28:10.820 --> 28:12.180
and then you ceviche it

28:12.180 --> 28:14.580
or God forbid the other way around?

28:15.300 --> 28:16.020
No, no, no.

28:16.020 --> 28:20.740
You barbecue some meat, ceviche it, grill it again,

28:21.300 --> 28:22.260
and then you taste it.

28:22.260 --> 28:23.460
You're like, I don't know.

28:23.460 --> 28:24.980
Are you trying to say su-vee?

28:24.980 --> 28:26.980
No, sir.

28:26.980 --> 28:27.780
Ceviche.

28:28.420 --> 28:29.780
It's a way of cooking.

28:29.780 --> 28:33.220
You put all of mama's spices on it,

28:33.220 --> 28:34.260
then you ceviche.

28:35.780 --> 28:37.620
And then that's a barbecue, baby.

28:37.620 --> 28:38.420
As long as there's corn.

28:38.420 --> 28:40.260
Pretty sure ceviche just means you put it

28:40.260 --> 28:43.940
in a bath of high citric sort of juices

28:43.940 --> 28:44.980
and you let it sort of-

28:45.860 --> 28:47.300
Right, and that is how it cooks.

28:48.180 --> 28:49.060
It becomes edible.

28:49.060 --> 28:52.100
Now we're talking about sort of very,

28:52.100 --> 28:54.660
very sour pulled pork or something.

28:54.660 --> 28:56.660
That doesn't tickle my buds.

28:57.220 --> 28:58.820
I didn't say it was good.

28:58.820 --> 28:59.780
I said it was new.

29:01.220 --> 29:03.220
And did I mention the corn?

29:03.220 --> 29:05.380
Again, there will be corn served,

29:05.380 --> 29:07.700
which elevates any meal to barbecue.

29:07.700 --> 29:09.780
What if you just, here's mine, here's mine.

29:09.780 --> 29:11.140
May I suggest, I got one.

29:11.140 --> 29:12.420
I'd love to hear your, Shrav.

29:12.420 --> 29:14.740
Take some meat, whatever cut you want.

29:14.740 --> 29:17.780
You can do chicken or beef or pork.

29:17.780 --> 29:23.540
You know, you could even do like a meat substitute,

29:23.540 --> 29:25.220
like a meatless, a Beyond Meat option.

29:26.180 --> 29:29.700
Then you're going to leave it in the sun for 48 hours.

29:29.700 --> 29:30.580
Sun ceviche.

29:30.580 --> 29:36.260
Yeah, uncovered, just loose and raw in the sun for 48 hours.

29:36.260 --> 29:38.260
And after 48 hours, it's done.

29:38.900 --> 29:40.900
Okay, I got one.

29:40.900 --> 29:41.780
Now don't eat it.

29:42.420 --> 29:44.420
Once again, it's not good.

29:44.420 --> 29:45.460
Good, it's just a different-

29:45.460 --> 29:47.060
It's just a different way to do it.

29:47.060 --> 29:49.940
It's kind of like sun tea, but barbecue.

29:49.940 --> 29:54.820
You need to, in your grill, throw down just enough briquettes

29:54.820 --> 29:58.740
or wood chips or whatever, so that it might light

29:58.740 --> 30:00.660
when you throw a match on there, okay?

30:00.660 --> 30:02.420
And then you're going to put a couple of steaks on it,

30:02.420 --> 30:03.860
on the grill, on the barbie,

30:03.860 --> 30:05.300
and you're going to throw the match in

30:05.300 --> 30:06.420
and close the lid real fast.

30:06.420 --> 30:08.980
And then you're going to weld that lid shut,

30:08.980 --> 30:11.540
and then you're going to bury it underground

30:11.540 --> 30:14.900
and like pour the hole with cement so it's filled in.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.260
And then it's quantum beef.

30:16.260 --> 30:18.260
Ooh!

30:18.260 --> 30:24.820
Until that beef is observed, it is cooked and uncooked.

30:24.820 --> 30:26.180
It's quantum beef.

30:26.180 --> 30:28.340
It could be either one, but we won't-

30:28.340 --> 30:30.020
It's both cooked and uncooked,

30:30.020 --> 30:33.540
but it is inedible in a concrete sense.

30:33.540 --> 30:33.940
Maybe not.

30:33.940 --> 30:35.460
Regardless, we're not going to be able to get it out.

30:35.460 --> 30:38.260
Once again, this isn't to be eaten.

30:38.260 --> 30:41.380
Do you even understand molecular gastronomy?

30:41.380 --> 30:43.540
Come on, it's not about eating it.

30:43.540 --> 30:45.380
It's about fucking it up.

30:45.380 --> 30:46.500
Who are you talking to here?

30:46.500 --> 30:48.100
Because I feel like I've been on board with this

30:48.100 --> 30:49.140
first, and you're just-

30:49.140 --> 30:49.620
I don't know.

30:49.620 --> 30:52.340
I think I just kind of got mad at the world there.

30:52.340 --> 30:53.620
Yeah, yeah, that's, phew.

30:53.620 --> 30:55.060
Hey, speaking of, I have an idea.

30:55.700 --> 30:56.900
Liquid nitrogen.

30:58.580 --> 30:58.980
Okay.

30:59.700 --> 31:01.620
I don't know how I would apply it

31:01.620 --> 31:04.660
in such a way that would make it barbecue-esque.

31:04.660 --> 31:06.020
I just know that that's a thing

31:06.660 --> 31:09.060
that like food scientists use a lot.

31:09.620 --> 31:12.100
I saw Mr. Wizard do that with a hot dog once.

31:12.100 --> 31:13.460
He's like, this could be-

31:13.460 --> 31:15.860
I saw him and he had the liquid nitrogen.

31:15.860 --> 31:18.100
He dipped the hot dog in it and he looks at the kid.

31:18.100 --> 31:20.100
He's like, that could be your fucking finger.

31:20.100 --> 31:22.180
Yeah, and then smashes it with a hammer, right?

31:22.180 --> 31:23.380
Remember that?

31:23.380 --> 31:24.340
They could have tried to eat it.

31:24.340 --> 31:26.580
And then he yelled, we're all just meat.

31:28.900 --> 31:34.260
I'm basically 225 hot dogs strapped together with casing.

31:34.260 --> 31:34.660
What?

31:34.660 --> 31:35.860
Old casing.

31:35.860 --> 31:37.620
They saw some shit in Nam.

31:37.620 --> 31:39.540
But sir, what about the soul?

31:39.540 --> 31:40.660
We're just meat.

31:41.940 --> 31:43.460
Meat in dreams.

31:43.460 --> 31:44.980
You're dream meat.

31:44.980 --> 31:46.260
Uh, Mr. Wizard?

31:47.060 --> 31:47.780
Are you okay?

31:47.780 --> 31:48.180
Are you okay?

31:48.180 --> 31:50.340
I was going through some stuff at home.

31:50.340 --> 31:51.060
I'm okay.

31:51.060 --> 31:54.820
As okay as a shambling meat bags can be.

31:56.100 --> 31:59.300
Anyway, you want to learn how to use a computer?

31:59.300 --> 32:00.980
Now get in this big barrel

32:00.980 --> 32:02.980
and push some water out through this tube.

32:03.540 --> 32:06.020
I made a box that look like a coffin.

32:06.660 --> 32:08.660
Hey, do you want to look at the eclipse?

32:08.660 --> 32:08.980
Yeah.

32:08.980 --> 32:10.020
Should we build a bot-

32:10.020 --> 32:10.820
No.

32:10.820 --> 32:11.140
No!

32:11.140 --> 32:13.540
What is it?

32:13.540 --> 32:15.620
You just burned a little bit of your eye meat.

32:15.620 --> 32:16.660
What do I care?

32:16.660 --> 32:19.460
It'll grow back or it won't and then we'll all die.

32:19.460 --> 32:19.860
It's me.

32:21.780 --> 32:23.300
Life is a great experiment.

32:28.660 --> 32:30.340
Mr. Wizard, can I go home now?

32:30.340 --> 32:30.580
No.

32:31.380 --> 32:31.860
No.

32:31.860 --> 32:33.540
You're my son now.

32:33.540 --> 32:35.140
Your mom said I could adopt you.

32:36.740 --> 32:38.420
I promised to teach you science.

32:38.420 --> 32:40.740
Your mom and I came to an understanding.

32:40.740 --> 32:42.260
You're going to college.

32:42.260 --> 32:45.220
I revealed to your mom the arcane meat secret

32:45.220 --> 32:47.060
and she just said she gave up.

32:47.060 --> 32:47.860
Now you're my meat.

32:50.660 --> 32:51.300
I love you.

32:52.100 --> 32:54.180
I plug four wires into a potato

32:54.180 --> 32:55.860
and plug the other ends into a clock.

32:55.860 --> 32:56.660
Nothing's happening.

32:56.660 --> 32:58.100
That's because time's an illusion.

33:00.660 --> 33:03.380
You learned something real more valuable than science today.

33:04.820 --> 33:05.860
Now get me a beer.

33:06.500 --> 33:08.260
Give me seven beers.

33:08.260 --> 33:09.940
How does that potato clock work though?

33:09.940 --> 33:12.580
Damn, I hate the science teachers always do that.

33:12.580 --> 33:13.780
They're like, hey, check this out.

33:13.780 --> 33:15.700
Wire, wire, tato, tato, clock.

33:15.700 --> 33:16.980
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

33:16.980 --> 33:18.660
And then they're like, pretty cool, right?

33:18.660 --> 33:20.980
And you're like, holy fucking shit.

33:20.980 --> 33:22.820
The potato made the thing go?

33:22.820 --> 33:24.020
And they're like, yep.

33:24.020 --> 33:25.460
And then you say, how's that work?

33:25.460 --> 33:26.980
And they say, I'll never tell.

33:26.980 --> 33:28.260
That's fucking up.

33:28.260 --> 33:31.540
They should tell us how the potato makes the clock go, I think.

33:31.540 --> 33:34.180
And if anyone wants to tell me how crystals make a radio,

33:34.180 --> 33:36.820
I've wondered about that for fucking years.

33:36.820 --> 33:37.460
Yeah.

33:37.460 --> 33:40.580
Hey, the one thing I do know, understand the secrets of,

33:40.580 --> 33:41.700
is commercialism.

33:41.700 --> 33:43.220
And I would love if you guys would

33:43.220 --> 33:43.940
accompany me to the money zone.

33:43.940 --> 33:44.440
Please.

33:54.580 --> 33:57.380
First up, first on the bat, it's Squarespace.

33:57.380 --> 33:57.940
Squarespace has a-

33:57.940 --> 33:58.900
You guys heard about this?

33:58.900 --> 33:59.940
You guys heard about this?

33:59.940 --> 34:03.860
Is a batting average of one, which is good for baseball.

34:03.860 --> 34:07.220
And it's not a baseball player, but it is a platform

34:07.220 --> 34:10.740
that lets you build a website from Squarespace.

34:10.740 --> 34:13.540
And you can showcase your work and sell products and services

34:13.540 --> 34:16.420
of all kinds, promote your physical or online business,

34:16.420 --> 34:17.860
or make a website.

34:17.860 --> 34:19.220
And if you want to make a website,

34:19.780 --> 34:21.780
these tools give you the powers of website right

34:21.780 --> 34:22.660
at your fingertips.

34:22.660 --> 34:25.540
They have beautiful customizable templates for websites.

34:25.540 --> 34:29.060
And it's optimized for mobile if people want to do phones.

34:29.780 --> 34:33.540
And you can track your analytics to just see how many just

34:34.180 --> 34:35.460
clickos you're getting.

34:35.460 --> 34:39.380
And then the hosting is secure, whatever that means.

34:39.380 --> 34:41.540
And you don't ever have to upgrade things.

34:41.540 --> 34:42.020
Upgrade?

34:43.060 --> 34:43.700
Boring.

34:43.700 --> 34:45.700
Don't have to do that with Squarespace.

34:45.700 --> 34:49.380
Go to squarespace.com slash my brother for a free trial.

34:49.380 --> 34:50.900
And when you're ready to launch,

34:50.900 --> 34:52.420
you're going to use the offer code my brother,

34:52.420 --> 34:55.620
and then you're going to save 10% off your first purchase

34:55.620 --> 34:57.380
of a website or a domain.

34:59.060 --> 35:01.860
Hey, Griffin, can I talk to you real quick?

35:01.860 --> 35:03.780
Everybody, hey, everybody stop listening.

35:03.780 --> 35:06.340
Um, this isn't, this part's not for you.

35:07.140 --> 35:08.500
I couldn't help but notice, Griffin,

35:08.500 --> 35:11.220
that your stitch is busted.

35:12.260 --> 35:13.140
Oh my God.

35:13.700 --> 35:15.620
Yeah, I don't mean to embarrass you,

35:15.620 --> 35:17.540
but I mean, look at you, dude.

35:17.540 --> 35:18.900
Look, what's that shirt?

35:18.900 --> 35:20.180
What even is that shirt?

35:20.900 --> 35:22.340
It's an assless shirt.

35:23.300 --> 35:25.380
Yes, Griffin, but what does that even mean?

35:25.380 --> 35:26.580
I don't know.

35:26.580 --> 35:29.940
When I bought it from that food truck,

35:29.940 --> 35:31.540
I thought, oh, fuck.

35:31.540 --> 35:33.700
You're wearing mittens as pants, Griffin.

35:33.700 --> 35:34.900
It's not right.

35:34.900 --> 35:36.180
I know it's not right,

35:36.180 --> 35:38.820
but it's been a hard year, Trav, on all of us.

35:38.820 --> 35:41.060
It's been a hard year on all of us for sure, Griffin.

35:41.060 --> 35:44.020
You need to fix your stitch with Stitch Fix.

35:45.140 --> 35:46.580
I'm gonna take another run at that?

35:46.580 --> 35:48.180
Nope, stickin' with it.

35:48.740 --> 35:51.860
Stitch Fix offers clothes hand-selected by expert stylists

35:51.860 --> 35:54.020
for your unique size, style, and budget.

35:54.020 --> 35:58.820
Griffin, I'm gonna say your style is a grown up-

35:58.820 --> 35:59.700
Thank you.

35:59.700 --> 36:00.980
Thank you.

36:00.980 --> 36:01.480
Boy.

36:02.420 --> 36:02.920
Thank you?

36:02.920 --> 36:03.460
Grown up boy.

36:04.100 --> 36:05.140
Like a big boy.

36:05.140 --> 36:06.340
Yeah, sure.

36:06.340 --> 36:07.540
A big boy.

36:07.540 --> 36:08.340
A big grown up boy.

36:08.340 --> 36:08.980
Yeah, no, we get it.

36:08.980 --> 36:12.340
A big grown up boy who's comfortable at a wedding

36:12.340 --> 36:13.220
or a funeral.

36:14.820 --> 36:16.820
I would say that's kind of your style.

36:16.820 --> 36:19.700
I described myself yesterday while on a call with some friends

36:19.700 --> 36:22.420
as having the body of a huge toddler.

36:22.420 --> 36:23.220
So that works.

36:23.220 --> 36:24.180
Yeah, that is great.

36:25.220 --> 36:26.340
That works.

36:26.340 --> 36:29.780
Mine, I like to think my style is benevolent drifter.

36:29.780 --> 36:30.100
Yes, absolutely.

36:30.100 --> 36:32.260
Like that guy who at the beginning of the movie,

36:32.260 --> 36:33.540
you're like, oh, I don't know if I trust him.

36:33.540 --> 36:36.260
But then when the vampires attack, you're glad he's there.

36:36.260 --> 36:37.620
You know, that's my thing.

36:38.260 --> 36:41.460
Justin's not here, but Justin's style is of course vacation dad.

36:41.460 --> 36:42.340
Everyone knows that.

36:42.980 --> 36:45.780
So you can try on pieces at home before you buy,

36:45.780 --> 36:48.100
keep your favorites, and send back the rest.

36:48.100 --> 36:51.300
Stitch Fix has free shipping, easy returns and exchanges,

36:51.300 --> 36:54.180
and a prepaid return envelope is included.

36:54.180 --> 36:56.900
And there's no subscription required.

36:56.900 --> 36:58.340
I would also say just real quick,

36:58.340 --> 37:01.300
my style can also sometimes be rogue wizard,

37:01.300 --> 37:03.060
but that's more when I'm feeling fancy

37:03.060 --> 37:04.180
and want to get dressed up.

37:04.740 --> 37:06.980
Most of the time, benevolent drifter.

37:06.980 --> 37:08.180
It's between those two.

37:09.220 --> 37:11.860
And a lot of those clothes came from Stitch Fix.

37:12.420 --> 37:15.940

37:28.020 --> 37:30.900
Hey, I'm Janet Farney, host of the JV Club podcast.

37:32.340 --> 37:33.620
Ah, high school.

37:33.620 --> 37:37.060
Was it a time of adventure, romance, and discovery?

37:37.060 --> 37:39.300
Class of 95, we did it!

37:40.420 --> 37:45.380
Or a time of angst, disappointment, and confusion?

37:45.380 --> 37:48.420
We're all tied together by four years of trauma at this place,

37:48.420 --> 37:50.180
but enjoy adulthood, I guess.

37:50.180 --> 37:53.700
Yes, the truth is, it was both.

37:54.820 --> 37:57.380
So join me on the JV Club podcast

37:57.380 --> 37:59.940
where I invite some great friends like Kristen Bell,

37:59.940 --> 38:01.540
Angela Kinsey, Oscar Nunez,

38:01.540 --> 38:03.620
Neil Patrick Harris, and Keegan Michael Key

38:03.620 --> 38:05.940
to talk about high school, the good, the bad,

38:05.940 --> 38:07.140
and everything in between.

38:07.140 --> 38:10.180
My teenage mood swings are getting harder to manage.

38:10.180 --> 38:11.220
The JV Club.

38:11.220 --> 38:12.500
Find it on Maximum Fun.

38:14.100 --> 38:15.620
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.

38:15.620 --> 38:15.860
Okay.

38:15.860 --> 38:16.500
Oh.

38:16.500 --> 38:17.620
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.

38:17.620 --> 38:18.100
What do you say?

38:18.100 --> 38:18.600
Okay.

38:23.220 --> 38:24.820
I want a munch squad.

38:25.540 --> 38:27.940
Jingle, jingle, jingle, jingle, jingle.

38:27.940 --> 38:29.940
I want a munch squad.

38:29.940 --> 38:32.900
Jingle, jingle, jingle, jingle, jingle.

38:32.900 --> 38:34.580
Welcome to Holiday Munch Squad.

38:34.580 --> 38:36.100
It's a podcast within a podcast,

38:36.100 --> 38:38.340
profiling the latest and greatest in holiday brand eating.

38:38.980 --> 38:40.340
Uh, I got an excite-

38:40.340 --> 38:41.860
I'm so excited about this one.

38:41.860 --> 38:43.060
Is it donut related?

38:43.060 --> 38:44.580
Because I really miss Count Donut.

38:44.580 --> 38:48.420
No, he's not in this one, but I'll tell you who is here.

38:48.420 --> 38:50.100
Uh, it's McDonald's,

38:50.100 --> 38:52.020
which actually doesn't figure in a munch squad

38:52.020 --> 38:52.820
as much as you think,

38:52.820 --> 38:54.740
because they don't really get buckwilder,

38:54.740 --> 38:55.620
but they have done it.

38:55.620 --> 38:57.060
And this is a new press release.

38:57.060 --> 39:00.340
This just came out today as we're recording this.

39:00.340 --> 39:03.140
And this is a promotion that's kicking off December 14th.

39:03.140 --> 39:05.460
Holiday cheer arrives at McDonald's

39:05.460 --> 39:07.540
as fans can enjoy the favorite menu items

39:07.540 --> 39:09.300
of Santa Claus, the Grinch, and more.

39:09.300 --> 39:10.100
The favorite-

39:10.100 --> 39:10.980
Oh my God.

39:12.820 --> 39:13.700
Okay.

39:13.700 --> 39:15.940
So this is like when Travis Scott, yeah.

39:15.940 --> 39:17.060
Yeah, but it's like that,

39:17.060 --> 39:18.820
except for Santa Claus, the Grinch, and more.

39:19.380 --> 39:21.380
So this year, goodies won't just be found

39:21.380 --> 39:22.500
tucked under the tree.

39:22.500 --> 39:25.700
McDonald's is tapping its elves, gross,

39:25.700 --> 39:28.100
to offer delicious daily in-app deals

39:28.100 --> 39:29.540
that feature the festive favorites

39:29.540 --> 39:30.980
of some classic holiday characters,

39:31.540 --> 39:33.700
including, well, I'm going to skip that

39:33.700 --> 39:35.940
because I don't want to mess up the game that I have.

39:35.940 --> 39:37.300
Oh, I can't wait.

39:37.940 --> 39:38.900
Yeah, baby.

39:40.180 --> 39:43.460
Daily deals will conclude on December 24th

39:43.460 --> 39:47.060
with a certain jolly someone's most treasured treat,

39:47.060 --> 39:48.900
free soft-baked chocolate chip cookies.

39:48.900 --> 39:49.540
That's nice.

39:49.540 --> 39:51.940
You roll in on Christmas Eve to McDonald's.

39:51.940 --> 39:52.980
It's not sad.

39:52.980 --> 39:53.940
You get a free cookie.

39:55.700 --> 39:58.660
Quote from Morgan Flatley,

39:58.660 --> 40:03.060
the US McDonald's CMO, Chief Marketing Officer.

40:05.380 --> 40:07.780
After a year like 2020,

40:07.780 --> 40:10.900
I think we could all use some extra cheer this season.

40:10.900 --> 40:12.340
Go on, Morgan.

40:12.340 --> 40:14.580
Do tell.

40:14.580 --> 40:17.620
What better way to celebrate and get into the holiday spirit

40:17.620 --> 40:20.820
with free McDonald's menu favorites for everyone,

40:20.820 --> 40:25.060
including Rudolph, the abominable snow monster.

40:25.060 --> 40:25.940
Bumble, please.

40:26.580 --> 40:30.260
Please, Bumble, and even, yes, even Scrooge.

40:30.260 --> 40:32.900
Huh, pre or post-Scrooge?

40:35.940 --> 40:37.300
Looking at this, probably pre.

40:38.260 --> 40:40.900
So you can get it in the thing.

40:40.900 --> 40:42.820
So you guys are about to do the hardest thing

40:42.820 --> 40:44.340
you've ever done in your entire lives.

40:46.020 --> 40:48.580
There are 10 days of meals here.

40:50.020 --> 40:52.260
I say meals, but it's really like a free item

40:52.260 --> 40:56.180
that you get to celebrate a Christmas personality.

40:56.180 --> 40:58.500
Hey, Justin, can I just do one from downtown?

40:59.540 --> 41:00.340
Yeah, bud.

41:00.340 --> 41:02.980
The abominable snowman is a McFlurry.

41:02.980 --> 41:03.380
Nope.

41:03.380 --> 41:03.620
Fuck.

41:03.620 --> 41:04.180
You asshole.

41:04.740 --> 41:05.300
Really?

41:05.300 --> 41:06.100
You thought you were at McDonald's.

41:06.100 --> 41:07.540
Try again on the McFlurry.

41:07.540 --> 41:08.020
Try again.

41:08.020 --> 41:08.420
Try again.

41:08.420 --> 41:08.980
Try again.

41:08.980 --> 41:10.500
Is that Frosty the Snowman?

41:10.500 --> 41:11.380
There you go, bud.

41:11.380 --> 41:12.100
There you go, bud.

41:12.100 --> 41:12.980
You got it in two.

41:12.980 --> 41:14.020
That's very respectable.

41:14.020 --> 41:15.220
It's a fuck lot better than you guys

41:15.220 --> 41:16.100
are gonna do with the rest of these.

41:17.220 --> 41:20.740
December 14th, come on down to McDonald's

41:20.740 --> 41:22.580
for a free double cheeseburger.

41:23.620 --> 41:26.420
Huh, a double cheeseburger.

41:27.380 --> 41:29.780
Wait, this is associated with a holiday figure?

41:30.980 --> 41:34.100
A beloved holiday figure.

41:34.660 --> 41:36.260
A double cheeseburger?

41:36.260 --> 41:45.540
Is it Santa Claus?

41:45.540 --> 41:48.660
I feel like it's Santa Claus's December 24th.

41:48.660 --> 41:50.580
I'm gonna give that to you right now, okay?

41:50.580 --> 41:51.700
He gets a free chocolate chip cookie.

41:51.700 --> 41:52.980
I'm gonna say it's the Grinch?

41:54.340 --> 41:55.620
No, bud, it's the Griswolds.

41:55.620 --> 41:57.780
You know the Griswolds from National Lampoon's

41:57.780 --> 41:58.020
Christmas Vacation?

41:58.020 --> 42:00.260
Oh, beloved Christmas icons.

42:00.260 --> 42:04.020
Yeah, they love the free double cheeseburger at McDonald's

42:04.020 --> 42:04.740
and that's what they're getting.

42:04.740 --> 42:07.700
I remember that scene when he's being horny

42:07.700 --> 42:08.660
for the other woman.

42:09.380 --> 42:12.420
And they split four ways, a double cheeseburger.

42:14.100 --> 42:16.100
On the next day you come back in,

42:16.100 --> 42:17.300
you're gonna get a free Big Mac.

42:18.900 --> 42:20.180
Is that the Bumble?

42:20.180 --> 42:21.700
That's gotta be the Bumble, right?

42:21.700 --> 42:22.580
That's the Bumble.

42:22.580 --> 42:23.620
Good job, guys.

42:23.620 --> 42:24.260
That one you got.

42:24.260 --> 42:25.780
Because it's big, just like the Bumble.

42:26.900 --> 42:30.580
The next day, come on in for a free Egg McMuffin.

42:30.580 --> 42:34.100
No, the voice makes me think Grinch.

42:34.100 --> 42:35.220
I mean, it's the Grinch.

42:35.220 --> 42:36.740
That's the Grinchy shit.

42:36.740 --> 42:38.500
He's in there all day, every day.

42:39.140 --> 42:41.060
Give me a McMuffin.

42:41.060 --> 42:41.620
What is that?

42:41.620 --> 42:43.860
It's got that flat ham I love.

42:46.260 --> 42:48.420
Give that part to my dog, Max.

42:49.780 --> 42:52.340
Okay, did you guys see that fucking musical, by the way?

42:52.340 --> 42:52.660
No.

42:52.660 --> 42:55.780
That NBC staged a live stage reading of,

42:56.580 --> 42:59.220
not a staged version of the Grinch musical.

42:59.220 --> 43:01.300
Fucking how did you turn that into two hours?

43:01.300 --> 43:02.340
Well, I'll give you a hint.

43:02.340 --> 43:05.700
They turned the dog into two separate speaking roles.

43:05.700 --> 43:07.860
Yes, an older dog and a younger dog,

43:08.420 --> 43:10.100
both of which had solos.

43:10.100 --> 43:10.740
Fantastic.

43:10.740 --> 43:12.100
Anyway, sorry.

43:13.220 --> 43:16.180
It's a free McDouble the next day, December 17th.

43:16.180 --> 43:16.740
Free McDouble.

43:16.740 --> 43:17.540
What's a McDouble?

43:17.540 --> 43:19.060
Is that just a two patty burger?

43:19.780 --> 43:21.300
It's just a two patty burger, baby.

43:23.300 --> 43:24.100
McDouble, huh?

43:25.300 --> 43:26.420
George Bailey.

43:27.380 --> 43:28.180
No, listen.

43:28.180 --> 43:29.620
It's a free McDouble.

43:29.620 --> 43:30.340
Think, Travis.

43:30.340 --> 43:33.220
Travis, use your fucking brain for once.

43:36.100 --> 43:36.980
Rudolph?

43:36.980 --> 43:37.860
I don't know, man.

43:39.700 --> 43:41.300
If I say Rudolph for all of these,

43:41.300 --> 43:43.300
eventually I'll get a hit.

43:43.300 --> 43:43.860
Double.

43:43.860 --> 43:45.540
Well, it's John McClain.

43:47.380 --> 43:50.020
Oh, because it's McDouble McClain.

43:50.020 --> 43:50.580
Is that anything?

43:50.580 --> 43:52.020
Yeah, there's a lot of things, though,

43:52.020 --> 43:54.660
because McMuffin was the last one.

43:54.660 --> 43:57.860
So yeah, that is a wild pick.

43:57.860 --> 44:01.300
Free, medium, world famous fries

44:01.300 --> 44:02.660
with, according to this picture,

44:03.220 --> 44:04.260
two packets of ketchup.

44:05.860 --> 44:06.900
George Bailey.

44:06.900 --> 44:08.180
Is that one Rudolph?

44:09.300 --> 44:10.820
That one's Rudolph, Greg.

44:10.820 --> 44:11.540
Good job.

44:11.540 --> 44:12.180
Yeah!

44:12.180 --> 44:14.340
Okay, but I tapped.

44:14.340 --> 44:17.860
Unless Donner and Blitzen are the next.

44:17.860 --> 44:19.860
I literally can't think of too many other

44:20.420 --> 44:22.180
Christmas time characters.

44:22.180 --> 44:24.100
There is a beloved Christmas icon

44:24.100 --> 44:25.780
that's going to slide you over

44:25.780 --> 44:29.780
on a free six-piece McNugget on December 19th.

44:29.780 --> 44:30.740
Well, that's Scridge.

44:30.740 --> 44:32.020
He loves them nugs.

44:32.020 --> 44:32.420
Elf?

44:32.420 --> 44:33.380
No, that's incorrect.

44:33.380 --> 44:34.100
Elf?

44:34.100 --> 44:35.060
At 8 p.m.

44:35.060 --> 44:35.700
What?

44:35.700 --> 44:37.780
On that day, you could be enjoying the...

44:38.980 --> 44:40.420
8 p.m., you could be enjoying the

44:41.140 --> 44:43.620
McElroy Family Candle Night Spectacular,

44:44.820 --> 44:47.940
and you could be eating a six-piece nugget

44:47.940 --> 44:50.660
provided to you by beloved Christmas icon,

44:51.220 --> 44:53.460
Gizmo from Gremlins.

44:53.460 --> 44:54.820
Wowzers, wowzers.

44:54.820 --> 44:58.100
They have 10 of these, and one of them's Gizmo.

45:00.100 --> 45:04.740
If one of them, if Gizmo gets on the freebie list,

45:04.740 --> 45:06.900
and Jesus Christ does not.

45:07.700 --> 45:08.420
Thank you.

45:08.420 --> 45:11.220
I feel like every McDonald's is going to be burned

45:11.220 --> 45:13.460
to the ground by a certain type of,

45:13.460 --> 45:15.060
let's say, Chick-fil-A fan.

45:16.740 --> 45:19.140
Free hotcakes, December 20th.

45:19.140 --> 45:20.580
Who's bringing you free hotcakes?

45:21.620 --> 45:22.420
Is that one Elf?

45:23.700 --> 45:24.660
That one's Elf, Greg.

45:24.660 --> 45:25.380
Griffin, congratulations.

45:25.380 --> 45:26.660
Okay, that actually makes sense.

45:26.660 --> 45:28.820
That's one of the very few that tracks.

45:28.820 --> 45:29.220
He loves Sarah.

45:29.220 --> 45:31.380
I feel like they came up with that one first.

45:31.380 --> 45:31.780
Yeah.

45:31.780 --> 45:32.580
Maybe, and they were like,

45:32.580 --> 45:34.580
this is a great idea for a promotion.

45:34.580 --> 45:35.780
Let's commit to it.

45:35.780 --> 45:40.740
Now, the next day, one hot coffee, please.

45:40.740 --> 45:41.220
Scrooge.

45:42.100 --> 45:42.820
That's Scrooge.

45:42.820 --> 45:43.060
Wow.

45:43.060 --> 45:44.500
That's Scrooge.

45:44.500 --> 45:46.260
We did Frosty Snowman on the 22nd.

45:46.820 --> 45:47.940
That's a free McFlurry.

45:47.940 --> 45:49.780
23rd, this is our last one,

45:49.780 --> 45:51.460
because obviously 24th is Santa.

45:51.460 --> 45:54.580
23rd is a free bakery item.

45:54.580 --> 45:55.700
That could be,

45:55.700 --> 45:57.620
of course, we all know that there's a new line of bakery items.

45:57.620 --> 46:02.100
Yes, there's a delightful marquee

46:02.100 --> 46:04.100
outside of my local McDonald's that says,

46:04.740 --> 46:06.020
new bakery items.

46:06.020 --> 46:06.980
And then on another line,

46:07.540 --> 46:08.180
tastes good.

46:10.740 --> 46:13.380
I'm gonna say George Bailey from It's a Wonderful Life.

46:15.300 --> 46:16.180
That would be good.

46:16.900 --> 46:18.500
Can I also say George Bailey?

46:19.140 --> 46:19.620
No.

46:19.620 --> 46:21.300
Okay, ah.

46:21.300 --> 46:22.100
But you're really,

46:22.100 --> 46:25.220
you're actually weirdly close with the first name.

46:25.220 --> 46:25.860
George Clinton.

46:25.860 --> 46:28.020
But the first name isn't George.

46:28.660 --> 46:29.860
George from Seinfeld?

46:30.420 --> 46:31.220
Yeah, he loves them.

46:33.060 --> 46:33.540
Jesus.

46:33.540 --> 46:34.820
Wait, no, wait, no, let's,

46:35.860 --> 46:38.740
you are so close.

46:38.740 --> 46:39.780
Is it Seinfeld?

46:39.780 --> 46:40.820
Why would it be Seinfeld?

46:40.820 --> 46:42.180
So fucking close.

46:42.180 --> 46:43.620
Please, you're so close.

46:44.260 --> 46:45.540
Just try a little bit harder.

46:46.740 --> 46:47.700
Think for a second.

46:47.700 --> 46:48.580
You can do this.

46:48.580 --> 46:51.060
Oh, it's the Festivus.

46:51.060 --> 46:53.060
I didn't watch enough fucking Seinfeld.

46:53.060 --> 46:54.420
I know they had their own.

46:54.420 --> 46:56.260
It's not George Costanza.

46:57.140 --> 46:59.220
Dad, George's dad, Costanza.

46:59.940 --> 47:01.940
Frank Costanza and the rest of us

47:01.940 --> 47:04.900
were celebrating Festivus on the third

47:04.900 --> 47:06.820
with a free bakery item.

47:06.820 --> 47:08.660
You know, 2020's been hard

47:08.660 --> 47:11.060
so this Grinch is giving you a McMuffin.

47:11.620 --> 47:14.180
That is absolutely bonkers.

47:14.180 --> 47:16.020
It's an in-app deal only though, y'all.

47:16.020 --> 47:19.940
So just kind of keep that in mind.

47:19.940 --> 47:21.460
I also have to read here

47:21.460 --> 47:23.460
that Seinfeld and all related characters

47:23.460 --> 47:26.260
and elements are TM Castle Rock Entertainment,

47:26.260 --> 47:27.540
Elf and all related characters.

47:27.540 --> 47:29.220
Now it's a business thing again.

47:29.220 --> 47:31.940
Oh God, commercialism.

47:31.940 --> 47:33.460
I thought this was just a fun thing

47:33.460 --> 47:35.540
our friend McDonald's was doing.

47:35.540 --> 47:36.100
Yeah, they ruined it.

47:36.100 --> 47:38.820
With our other friends, George's dad

47:38.820 --> 47:40.020
whose name I already forgot.

47:41.700 --> 47:42.580
Frank Ocean.

47:44.340 --> 47:45.460
I am a college student

47:45.460 --> 47:47.700
and I really like giving gifts.

47:47.700 --> 47:49.940
My roommate is really into fantasy

47:49.940 --> 47:51.540
slash Lord of the Rings type stuff

47:51.540 --> 47:53.620
so I recently bought him a map of his home state

47:53.620 --> 47:56.020
hand-drawn in a fantasy style

47:56.020 --> 47:57.380
to give to him for Christmas.

47:57.380 --> 47:58.580
A couple of days after it arrived,

47:58.580 --> 48:00.180
he mentioned how he saw a Facebook app

48:00.180 --> 48:01.300
for the same thing

48:01.300 --> 48:02.580
and how stupid he thought it was

48:02.580 --> 48:04.740
to get a fantasy map of your home state.

48:04.740 --> 48:07.060
Right now the map is collecting dust in my closet.

48:07.060 --> 48:09.140
Brothers, what do I do with this gift?

48:09.140 --> 48:12.100
That's from Sheepish Schlepp in Chicago.

48:12.100 --> 48:15.220
Hey, it's me, Chicago John.

48:15.220 --> 48:16.340
Forget about it.

48:17.300 --> 48:18.660
Forget about it.

48:19.380 --> 48:22.100
Try my deep dish pizza.

48:22.980 --> 48:25.460
It is me, Chicago Cubsman.

48:26.100 --> 48:27.300
It's my club.

48:27.300 --> 48:30.420
I'll splash the fantasy map whenever I want.

48:33.300 --> 48:35.780
Is it possible when your roommate said it was dumb

48:35.780 --> 48:37.700
what they meant is it's really cool

48:37.700 --> 48:39.940
and they're embarrassed at how cool they think it is

48:40.500 --> 48:41.860
and they're trying to seem cool

48:41.860 --> 48:43.460
by saying like, oh yeah, it's dumb.

48:43.460 --> 48:45.220
I'd hate to get that.

48:45.220 --> 48:47.060
Because it popped up in their Facebook ads

48:47.060 --> 48:49.060
so that must mean they really want it, right?

48:49.060 --> 48:50.980
Listen to Facebook, okay?

48:50.980 --> 48:52.180
Facebook's never wrong.

48:52.180 --> 48:52.680
No.

48:53.700 --> 48:55.940
I took a screenshot of a pretty bodacious shirt

48:55.940 --> 48:56.980
that it recommended to me

48:57.540 --> 49:00.340
that I'm going to try and find while I continue talking.

49:00.340 --> 49:02.500
I think you've got to give your roommate

49:02.500 --> 49:04.180
the fucking map anyway

49:04.180 --> 49:05.460
and then you can be like,

49:07.060 --> 49:08.580
I'm being ironic obviously.

49:09.220 --> 49:09.540
Get it?

49:09.540 --> 49:09.940
Get it?

49:09.940 --> 49:10.980
How silly it is?

49:10.980 --> 49:11.940
Can you imagine?

49:11.940 --> 49:13.860
I would say, give it to your roommate.

49:14.580 --> 49:16.500
Act like they never said anything.

49:17.700 --> 49:18.660
I don't like that.

49:19.460 --> 49:21.220
I don't love it because that both gives them

49:21.220 --> 49:22.340
a gift they won't like

49:22.340 --> 49:24.980
and also says I don't listen to you.

49:24.980 --> 49:28.020
Well, the other option is you have it in your closet

49:28.020 --> 49:29.940
until you forget about it and move out

49:29.940 --> 49:30.980
and don't take it with you.

49:32.740 --> 49:34.420
I would lean into it.

49:34.420 --> 49:36.180
I like the ironic thing.

49:36.180 --> 49:38.660
Like, I thought this is such a crack up

49:39.220 --> 49:40.740
when you mentioned it being bad.

49:40.740 --> 49:44.020
Also, my friend Justin is a podcaster

49:44.020 --> 49:45.620
and he wanted me to ask you,

49:45.620 --> 49:48.340
where the fuck do you get off being hugely into fantasy

49:48.340 --> 49:50.820
but being snide about fantasy maps of home state?

49:50.820 --> 49:52.980
Because it actually sounds really cool for me.

49:52.980 --> 49:54.260
It sounds so cool.

49:55.060 --> 49:56.580
I'm just saying if somebody wants to tell me

49:56.580 --> 49:58.420
where to get one of these of West Virginia,

49:58.420 --> 50:00.260
I would take the hell out of that.

50:01.540 --> 50:02.420
Oh, yeah.

50:02.420 --> 50:03.460
Batten down the hatches.

50:03.460 --> 50:04.420
People know how to get at you.

50:04.420 --> 50:05.140
Yeah, that's a good point.

50:05.140 --> 50:06.100
Where can I get one of those?

50:06.100 --> 50:08.980
Hey, where can I commission something like that

50:08.980 --> 50:11.460
but done in Fallout 76

50:11.460 --> 50:13.700
but also in a universe where Fallout 76

50:13.700 --> 50:14.660
was actually really good.

50:14.660 --> 50:15.460
It was a good game.

50:15.460 --> 50:16.020
Yeah, I mean, we're gonna-

50:16.020 --> 50:17.460
And also Fallout Boys in it.

50:17.460 --> 50:18.580
Oh, yeah.

50:18.580 --> 50:19.060
Shit.

50:19.060 --> 50:21.060
And Fallout Boy draw me that poster

50:21.060 --> 50:23.700
and I mean, all four of them at the same time.

50:23.700 --> 50:24.580
Holding the pencil all four of you.

50:24.580 --> 50:26.420
Just an exquisite Corpse style.

50:26.420 --> 50:28.020
And they're all kissing.

50:28.020 --> 50:30.500
That's also, so I found the image,

50:30.500 --> 50:32.660
the screenshot I took from a company.

50:32.660 --> 50:36.820
It's a sponsored suggested advertisement on my feed.

50:36.820 --> 50:39.140
Which I will admit is largely dormant.

50:39.140 --> 50:41.940
So I'm not giving them a lot of cookies.

50:41.940 --> 50:44.500
I'm not giving them any cookies to deal with.

50:45.300 --> 50:48.180
This is a get the perfect gift for loved ones.

50:48.180 --> 50:48.980
Order here.

50:49.540 --> 50:52.180
And then it's a shirt that's a white t-shirt

50:52.180 --> 50:55.060
and big black letters in like 14 different fonts.

50:55.060 --> 50:58.420
It says, sorry, I am already taken

50:58.420 --> 51:01.620
by a freaking awesome husband.

51:01.620 --> 51:03.700
He has anger issues and a serious dislike

51:03.700 --> 51:04.740
for stupid people.

51:04.740 --> 51:08.180
He's a perfect mixture of Prince Charming and warrior.

51:08.740 --> 51:10.500
He is my whole world.

51:10.500 --> 51:12.420
I love him forever and always.

51:12.420 --> 51:14.900
Mess with me and they'll never find your body.

51:14.900 --> 51:16.100
Yes, he bought me this.

51:16.900 --> 51:17.780
Fucking awesome.

51:17.780 --> 51:19.300
Have you thought about buying that for Rachel?

51:20.900 --> 51:22.900
I did do that.

51:22.900 --> 51:23.780
And it's her.

51:23.780 --> 51:24.420
She'll love that.

51:24.420 --> 51:27.940
Yeah, it's, we both call it her outside shirt.

51:27.940 --> 51:32.740
Cause it's the shirt she wears anytime we go.

51:32.740 --> 51:34.820
The shirt she wears anytime we go.

51:34.820 --> 51:36.020
Y'all, if you could see this,

51:36.020 --> 51:40.340
the absolutely Lovecraftian sort of

51:40.340 --> 51:44.580
tome of different fonts that is on this one fucking t-shirt,

51:44.580 --> 51:46.260
it would completely boggle your mind.

51:47.220 --> 51:47.780
I must.

51:47.780 --> 51:50.420
Yeah, I love targeted t-shirts like that.

51:51.860 --> 51:53.860
I think it could be more generic.

51:53.860 --> 51:55.140
Like if the t-shirt was like,

51:55.140 --> 52:01.940
yeah, I'm connected to another person who I see a lot.

52:01.940 --> 52:06.420
And they're a mixture of carbon and other stuff.

52:07.140 --> 52:08.180
And if you-

52:08.180 --> 52:09.300
They're just carbon.

52:09.300 --> 52:10.500
They're just me.

52:10.500 --> 52:11.380
They're dreams.

52:12.340 --> 52:14.580
They're meeting dreams wrapped up.

52:14.580 --> 52:17.300
I do wish I could just get a shirt that just said

52:17.300 --> 52:19.380
Prince Charming and Warrior on it.

52:20.020 --> 52:20.740
He is my whole world.

52:20.740 --> 52:21.620
What do you think is,

52:21.620 --> 52:24.580
now are you 50-50 Prince Charming and Warrior Griffin?

52:24.580 --> 52:27.300
Or do you think it's like 60-40 or where are you at?

52:27.300 --> 52:30.100
Well, I'm Prince Charming and Warrior

52:30.100 --> 52:32.900
in the streets and sheets, respectively.

52:33.860 --> 52:36.820
There's gotta be a better way to say that.

52:36.820 --> 52:39.140
I can be, but sometimes I'm a Warrior on the streets

52:39.140 --> 52:41.060
and a Prince Charming in the streets.

52:41.060 --> 52:43.380
I think if I were to choose,

52:43.380 --> 52:45.620
I would want Prince Charming in the sheets

52:45.620 --> 52:47.220
and Warrior on the streets.

52:47.220 --> 52:51.140
Well, sometimes you get the one that you ask for.

52:52.820 --> 52:56.980
I fucked up recently with my Facebook algorithm

52:56.980 --> 53:00.020
and then I mentioned on there that Sydney and I

53:00.020 --> 53:02.180
had watched some Schitt's Creek.

53:02.980 --> 53:06.020
And then the moment I posted it,

53:06.020 --> 53:09.220
the fucking t-shirt manufacturers were like,

53:09.220 --> 53:10.340
he's done it.

53:10.340 --> 53:11.460
Justin's finally done it.

53:11.460 --> 53:12.260
He did it.

53:12.260 --> 53:13.060
Open the gates.

53:13.620 --> 53:14.580
Here it comes.

53:14.580 --> 53:17.220
Here comes all the hot bad holiday sweaters.

53:17.220 --> 53:18.020
Here's everything.

53:18.020 --> 53:19.220
Let him have it all.

53:19.220 --> 53:20.660
Fantasy maps of Schitt's Creek.

53:21.380 --> 53:22.660
Toys for Schitt's Creek.

53:23.220 --> 53:24.580
Schitt's Creek toilet paper.

53:25.380 --> 53:26.420
Open the gates.

53:26.420 --> 53:27.380
Let it all fly.

53:28.420 --> 53:29.220
That scared me.

53:30.900 --> 53:32.660
If anybody wants to start a business

53:32.660 --> 53:35.700
doing Lord of the Rings style maps of Schitt's Creek,

53:35.700 --> 53:36.820
I would take that.

53:36.820 --> 53:38.180
I would take one, please.

53:38.180 --> 53:39.860
Fucking guarantee.

53:39.860 --> 53:41.140
I'm going to type in.

53:41.140 --> 53:43.940
I'm going to fuck my algorithm deeply.

53:43.940 --> 53:47.620
I'm going to ruin my Google for the rest of my life

53:47.620 --> 53:48.260
and type in.

53:48.980 --> 53:50.980
I will never dig out of this algorithmic hole

53:50.980 --> 53:52.180
I'm about to dig for myself.

53:52.180 --> 53:53.860
I hesitate to even type it,

53:53.860 --> 53:56.500
but I am going to type fantasy map of Schitt's Creek

53:58.180 --> 54:00.500
and see what I get.

54:00.500 --> 54:02.740
And yep, there's a lot.

54:03.380 --> 54:08.660
My computer is now giving itself a wedgie.

54:12.180 --> 54:12.580
Brutal.

54:13.780 --> 54:14.820
Just brutal stuff.

54:14.820 --> 54:16.660
Well, can you take us to the bridge, Justin?

54:17.620 --> 54:18.180
Yeah, bud.

54:18.180 --> 54:20.260
Thanks so much for listening to our podcast.

54:21.460 --> 54:23.060
We hope you've enjoyed it.

54:23.060 --> 54:24.100
If you enjoyed it one third,

54:24.100 --> 54:26.820
as much as we enjoyed making it, then-

54:26.820 --> 54:29.060
Then that's not a very good return on investment.

54:29.060 --> 54:30.180
No, it isn't.

54:30.180 --> 54:33.540
But still, we hope you had fun.

54:33.540 --> 54:35.780
Thank you so much for joining us.

54:35.780 --> 54:38.500

54:38.500 --> 54:40.100
I'm just going to blow through some real quick.

54:40.660 --> 54:43.380

54:43.380 --> 54:44.340
It's called Taste of Luxury.

54:44.340 --> 54:46.180
It's on YouTube on the McElroy Family channel.

54:46.180 --> 54:47.300
There's five parts of it.

54:49.140 --> 54:50.420
