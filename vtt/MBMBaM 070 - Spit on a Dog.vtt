WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.840
Ladies and gentlemen, you've found my brother, my brother, and we had an advice show for the

00:47.840 --> 00:56.080
modern era, and we have Emmy fever. Tonight, I'm gonna sit down with a box of popcorn and a bottle

00:56.080 --> 01:05.280
of Pinot Gris and watch Miss Jane Lynch do her thing tonight on the Emmy stage to honor some

01:05.280 --> 01:10.160
of my favorite programs of the year. Who do you like, Justin? Who do you favor this year?

01:11.040 --> 01:17.520
Glee, obviously. Like across the board? I got Glee fever over here. Glee-ver. I've got it.

01:17.520 --> 01:23.200
Who's taking home that tiny golden angel? That little golden angel is going in the hands of the

01:23.200 --> 01:33.760
talented Miss Lea Michele for her portrayal of a role of Sing Girl from Glee. Jessica Singstar.

01:34.640 --> 01:42.720
Jessica Singstar, the talented upstart, half Jewish, half singer, talent powerhouse

01:42.720 --> 01:47.680
known as Glee-a Michele. Now, Justin, let me ask you this. Yes? Who's your pick for

01:47.680 --> 01:53.360
outstanding sound mixing for nonfictioning and programming? That is going to go to the one and

01:53.360 --> 02:00.000
only Ken Burns for his documentary on Glee. Ah, I see. My name is Justin McElroy. I'm your oldest

02:00.000 --> 02:06.480
brother, and I have Glee-ver. I'm Travis McElroy, and I think that that Ken Burns documentary would

02:06.480 --> 02:18.080
be called The Gay the Earth Stood Still. I'm Griffin. How's your Glee-ver right now?

02:18.720 --> 02:28.560
That's low. I took a pretty intense regimen of antibiotics that really, really dried me up

02:29.200 --> 02:36.320
inside and out, but I've finally beaten the Glee. You kicked it? I kicked the Glee. It was tough

02:36.320 --> 02:44.160
tough stuff for a while, but now I'm just hooked on Modern Family. Oh, so the scenarios that they

02:44.160 --> 02:49.840
get into on that show. Which one on that show is the robot? I always forget. The little child,

02:49.840 --> 02:57.600
the child. The child is... Small Wonders 2. Yeah, they had to replace her because her robot batteries

02:57.600 --> 03:02.960
ran out. She died. Really? Yeah, she died from it. Don't you think that Modern Family, if you're

03:02.960 --> 03:07.040
gonna use a name like that, you gotta have one of the kids as an android. And maybe one's like a

03:07.040 --> 03:13.200
mutant, like a nuclear, you know, kind of thing. Yeah. Oh, and then you call it Nuclear Family.

03:13.200 --> 03:20.160
There you go. Hey, ABC, you're welcome. Hey, TM. TMC with a circle. This is, of course, an advice

03:20.160 --> 03:24.480
show for the modern era, so let's dip into the questions that we've been sent by you,

03:25.120 --> 03:30.880
the listening public. This morning I woke up from a fun-filled Friday night and realized I felt like

03:30.880 --> 03:36.240
garbage since I forgot to take care of the ibuprofen before bed and the too-early-in-the-morning trick.

03:36.240 --> 03:42.240
You're welcome, by the way, everybody. So my question is this. When I wake up feeling nauseous

03:42.240 --> 03:46.880
and a bit dizzy, not that hangover headache style, which, question without a question,

03:46.880 --> 03:51.120
is a splitting headache required for it to be considered a hangover? No. But just feeling

03:51.120 --> 03:57.840
disoriented and poopy, am I still technically drunk? And that's from oh god, I hope I don't

03:57.840 --> 04:04.160
blow a.08, which says to me this caller was drunk driving, which, of course, we do not endorse.

04:04.160 --> 04:08.560
No, because when you wake up in the morning, there's no way you're still drunk. Like,

04:08.560 --> 04:13.440
if you were still drunk, you wouldn't feel poopy and terrible. You'd feel awesome. You'd feel great.

04:13.440 --> 04:16.640
Yeah, right. Exactly. Exactly. It's fading fast.

04:16.640 --> 04:20.560
I think it's one of those things like a crazy person never, like, if you think you might be

04:20.560 --> 04:26.240
crazy, you're not crazy. Like, if you have the coherence to go, oh, I feel bad and crappy, maybe

04:26.240 --> 04:31.840
I'm drunk, then you're not drunk. Yeah, what you have is, it's called a loss of sense of well-being.

04:31.840 --> 04:37.360
It's one of the symptoms of hangovers, which, no, don't require headaches. It can manifest in

04:37.360 --> 04:44.720
lots of people different ways. Some people get, you know, headaches. Some people get nauseous.

04:44.720 --> 04:50.400
Some people get cranky. Some people get just really randy. Yeah. Yeah. Some people get like

04:50.400 --> 04:58.880
horny. Just real horny. Just horned out. The very first time I got drunk on Mountain Dew, Code Red,

04:58.880 --> 05:04.800
and vodka, I woke up the next morning just happy to be alive. Are you fucking kidding me? What?

05:04.800 --> 05:09.680
That's the first thing you got drunk on was Code Red and vodka? Yeah, that was a fun puke.

05:09.680 --> 05:16.720
Did you throw some combos into that cocktail? It was spicy tortilla and salsa. What kind of cheesy

05:16.720 --> 05:22.320
snack cracker were you pounding? You know what's funny about that that time? The very next night,

05:22.320 --> 05:28.640
I ate a pound hamburger at Fuddruckers, and I puked then too. Oh god. I puked two nights in a row,

05:28.640 --> 05:35.120
neither from illness. That weekend is your Everest. How's your lifestyle? Not good? Sounds

05:35.120 --> 05:41.840
pretty bad. Did this person ask for advice and I missed it? No, he's asking the question, is he

05:41.840 --> 05:48.080
still technically drunk? I think what he's asking is, is he capable to function the next morning and

05:48.080 --> 05:54.320
do things like drive to the store and drive home from the party? No. I was watching the Stateline

05:54.320 --> 05:59.600
where they said if you're mega sleepy, if you're the sleepiest, it's the same as being drunk.

06:00.240 --> 06:06.320
Here's the thing, people. Being drunk isn't the only thing that stops you from being a good driver.

06:06.320 --> 06:14.000
I can't stress that enough. If you're super tired or meat drunk or you're watching Netflix on your

06:14.000 --> 06:19.680
laptop or pot high, don't drive pot high. I can't stress that enough. No, because you'll get giggles.

06:20.400 --> 06:26.320
Oh yeah. Rely on your pot chauffeur. Always arrange for a pot chauffeur before. Never forget.

06:26.320 --> 06:32.320
Giles. Giles, I need you. Giles. Giles, take me to the Taco Bell.

06:32.320 --> 06:37.680
No. I think that what you should plan on is if you pass out at the party,

06:38.800 --> 06:45.520
general MO should be you wake up in the morning and you watch some kind of bro movie or terrible

06:45.520 --> 06:52.480
movie and have some eggs and just kind of lay on the couch for hours. Eggs are good. They have

06:52.480 --> 06:58.160
selenium in them. Your body is craving that. And also bacon if you got queasy tummy. Can you give

06:58.160 --> 07:04.560
us a bro movie? Just an example of a bro movie or a bad movie? Hangover. Okay, a little on the nose.

07:04.560 --> 07:11.680
But it's perfect. You can watch Short Circuit. Anything with Steve Guttenberg is going to be

07:11.680 --> 07:17.200
great. Anything with Tim Robbins from the 80s. Guttenberg has plenty of selenium in them and

07:17.200 --> 07:22.000
that's good. That's what your body craves. Your body craves the goot at that point.

07:22.000 --> 07:29.040
Idiocracy is a great movie to watch when you're hungover. My body craves Guttenberg. Gotta get

07:29.040 --> 07:36.160
the goot. This is Gatorade G3. The first two G's are Gatorade. The third one is Guttenberg.

07:36.160 --> 07:40.800
Can we jump back to the 80s when he was real popular so I can use the phrase get the goot

07:40.800 --> 07:47.200
more? Yeah, get that goot. Get the goot. You guys saw him in Veronica Mars. He was great. He still

07:47.200 --> 07:52.480
got all the old old pizzazz. Oh, his episode of Party Down is one of the funniest things I've ever

07:52.480 --> 07:59.120
seen. He's great. He's a talent. So I guess if you're, I don't know if you were still drunk when

07:59.120 --> 08:04.960
you wrote this email, but if you're still drunk, you have a serious problem. You're a mailman,

08:04.960 --> 08:12.160
probably. I mean, I'm pretty sure he was drunk. I'm looking at the, I'm looking at his grammar

08:12.160 --> 08:17.680
here. I'm looking at his, he's got parentheses inside of brackets, inside of those like curly

08:17.680 --> 08:21.440
brackets. I don't know what those are actually called. There's a lot of things, a lot of things

08:21.440 --> 08:26.480
happening in the typography here. What you can do is if you wake up and you're still drunk,

08:26.480 --> 08:31.440
you can do what my friend Dan did in college, which is decide it's not safe to drive home

08:31.440 --> 08:36.640
and walk home and take a nap under a tree. Hey, that's what trees are for you dummy. Yeah,

08:36.640 --> 08:41.280
they're right there. Shields you from the moonlight. They're like, hey, temporary houses

08:41.280 --> 08:47.920
for drunk people. My girlfriend elves and drunk elf. My girlfriend and I broke up about eight

08:47.920 --> 08:54.080
weeks ago. And even though I instigated it, it was still a very tough breakup. I'm feeling better

08:54.080 --> 09:00.000
now. Good. But I'm not quite back to my normal self. Last week, a cute girl gave me her number

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
and we'll be going on a date soon. However, I'm feeling nervous about the date. I'm not sure I'm

09:06.000 --> 09:11.520
fully over my ex and ready to go on a date with a new girl. How will I know when I'm ready? And

09:11.520 --> 09:16.240
is there anything wrong with going on a date when I'm not sure I'm ready? That's from ready or

09:16.240 --> 09:21.760
rebounding. I think that's how you, isn't that how you find out? Yeah. Yeah. You've come to the right

09:21.760 --> 09:26.160
place. That's, that is how you find out. Like you can't, you're so inside your own head right now.

09:26.160 --> 09:30.720
I I'm assuming that this was a long relationship that he was in. Um, if he's still having a tough

09:30.720 --> 09:35.840
time with it eight weeks later. At the very least, it sounds like it was important. Yeah. You know,

09:35.840 --> 09:40.720
um, so you may be ready, you may not be ready, but the only way to really tell is to, is to go

09:40.720 --> 09:46.080
on a date and there's nothing wrong with that. Um, you, you should probably be kind of upfront

09:46.080 --> 09:50.240
about the fact that you just got out of a, a long relationship, depending on how comfortable. Yeah.

09:50.240 --> 09:55.360
Don't like bring it, like, don't, that's not an open, by the way. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, I should tell

09:55.360 --> 10:00.000
you. Uh, and then you also don't want to linger on that point. You want to like drop that knowledge

10:00.000 --> 10:06.000
and then move on. Yeah. I wouldn't stress too much about odd date. You know what I mean? Like,

10:06.000 --> 10:09.120
I think you could debate whether or not you're ready to get back into a longterm relationship

10:09.120 --> 10:13.920
or what have you, but you know, it's a date. Just go on it. And you know, when I was, uh,

10:13.920 --> 10:19.280
when I was young, a young man and I, and I still do this to a certain extent. When you're sick,

10:20.400 --> 10:27.200
you spend whole days in bed, you know, eating your ramen or your noodles or what have you.

10:27.200 --> 10:33.440
Yeah. And when you think you're starting to feel better, I always used to do, I would call

10:33.440 --> 10:38.080
puttering around, you know, you put on some sweatpants, you just kind of move around the

10:38.080 --> 10:43.120
house a little bit. Get your bearings. If you stay there in bed, even when you're not sick,

10:43.120 --> 10:48.160
you're going to feel like it and loneliness and being single and getting over a breakup is a lot

10:48.160 --> 10:53.840
the same way until you kind of kick that in gear and force your body and mind into that. Like,

10:53.840 --> 10:58.480
like it's not going to happen to you. You've got to bring a little bit of momentum to that,

10:58.480 --> 11:02.240
to that change. And that's a really great analogy because while you're puttering around

11:02.240 --> 11:06.480
in the, the, the, the love sphere, you're going to still be wearing your sweat pants and you're

11:06.480 --> 11:11.440
not going to be super good at pretty much anything, but you'll, one of these days you'll

11:11.440 --> 11:16.240
shake off your contagion, you'll shake off the bonds of your plague and you'll leave your house

11:16.240 --> 11:20.800
and you'll fall in love again. You let the sunshine on your skin, feel the rain on your skin.

11:20.800 --> 11:24.320
Maybe this girl is that big bite of the recovery sandwich that you need to take.

11:24.320 --> 11:28.560
Right. Yeah. Big chomp of it. Have we used that term on this show before? That term was so

11:28.560 --> 11:32.560
important to me in my formative years. I don't think we've ever mentioned the recovery sandwich.

11:34.320 --> 11:37.840
How did the recovery, can you, can you explain to me the recovery sandwich a little bit, Griffin?

11:37.840 --> 11:44.480
Uh, I mean, anytime one of us would get hurt by a woman kind, which was frequent, uh, the others

11:44.480 --> 11:48.640
would sort of rally around. I'm pretty sure you incepted the phrase, Justin. And, uh,

11:48.640 --> 11:52.560
you know what? I actually think my dear friend, Tommy Red, incepted the recovery sandwich. He sent

11:52.560 --> 11:58.160
me the first one, I believe. Um, but you just take a big bite of that recovery sandwich. Just get on,

11:58.160 --> 12:03.760
just get on with it. You got to take measures. Yep. Just take some measures. Don't be afraid.

12:04.720 --> 12:10.880
Don't be afraid. Let love in again. Kiss her. Just, just kiss her on the cheeks. Just propose.

12:10.880 --> 12:18.400
Now I will say the one caveat I will have is that sometimes, uh, in that reboundy phase coming out

12:18.400 --> 12:23.280
of a serious breakup, uh, if it was a long-term serious relationship he came out of, you're going

12:23.280 --> 12:29.840
to want to rush things to get back to that feeling. Yeah. Oh shit. Pump those breaks pocket. Yeah,

12:29.840 --> 12:34.160
please. Cause you're not going to get back to that, you know, spending all day, cuddling in bed,

12:34.160 --> 12:42.000
watching movies phase on the first date, you know? Yeah. Just be cool. Low pressure situation. Uh,

12:42.000 --> 12:47.280
just be your awesome self. This is that part of relationship. You got to learn how to be totally

12:47.280 --> 12:55.520
cash. Yep. But not sweat pant cash. Yeah. That part of relationship is your reward for doing all

12:55.520 --> 13:02.560
this dumb shit for a year or so, but you got to get there. You both got to earn it. Um, and ladies,

13:02.560 --> 13:08.080
by the way, I wanted to make this clear. You too can have your own recovery sandwich. I got,

13:08.080 --> 13:11.920
you probably want to put weirder things on it. Cause I think girls like weirder things on their

13:11.920 --> 13:17.840
sandwiches. Like beans sprouts. Like alfalfa sprouts. Yeah. Oh God. Yes. Like alfalfa sprouts

13:17.840 --> 13:25.600
and avocado. Yucky. This sandwich is gross. But I mean, what would that, for, for, for men,

13:25.600 --> 13:30.880
we're so, man, we're so easy. We're so easy. We're so easy to pin down. Like my recovery

13:30.880 --> 13:36.560
sandwich could literally be a sandwich. I've eaten a sandwich that was so good that it,

13:36.560 --> 13:40.800
it helped heal my broken heart. He has pulled you right out of the doldrums. Yeah. Just like Paul

13:40.800 --> 13:46.880
Bart fills in the cracks in his heart with pie. Yeah. With a sandwich. Uh, mine is goofy movie.

13:46.880 --> 13:51.520
Yeah. Goofy movies. Great. I mean, for, for guys, it's, you know, going out and meeting

13:51.520 --> 13:56.720
another lady and having a good, good low-pressure cash time with her. Maybe it's something as

13:56.720 --> 14:04.640
simple as buying a whore. Yeah. Maybe go rent a whore from the rent-a-center. Well, rent to own.

14:04.640 --> 14:11.440
And then after a while, if you decide to keep it, it's yours. With no interest. It's wonderful. Hey,

14:11.440 --> 14:19.840
everybody. Travis just casually endorsed slavery. How's your Monday? Pretty good. Griffin, do you

14:19.840 --> 14:30.880
have a Yahoo answer to dig us out of this hole? This one was sent in by Emily Bartelt. Thank you,

14:30.880 --> 14:37.520
Emily Bartelt. It's by Yahoo answers user Derek Muller or Mueller who asks,

14:39.360 --> 14:41.520
would you ever date a bounty hunter?

14:44.400 --> 14:49.120
This question is for women. The bounty hunter is a guy. I think we can ignore that. That addendum.

14:50.160 --> 14:56.000
It's tough stuff. Are there female bounty hunters? Oh, I, oh, I hope so. I hope they,

14:56.000 --> 15:00.720
I can still find my dreams. I can actually prove that there aren't. Okay. Cause there's no

15:00.720 --> 15:06.400
series on the discovery channel about him. Fair enough. Yeah. Right. Statistically speaking.

15:06.400 --> 15:13.920
I mean dog, the bounty hunter's wife does so much sort of, um, ancillary work for him. I think she,

15:13.920 --> 15:18.400
she qualifies as a bounty hunter, right? Like she's a fucking tough. I think she's an apprentice

15:18.400 --> 15:22.560
bounty hunter. I don't think she, she's no, I don't like that. I don't like, I don't like,

15:22.560 --> 15:26.400
think of her as less of a bounty hunter just because she's in the Ferris acts. I think that

15:26.400 --> 15:31.200
she is. No, no, no. It's not that. I think she just hasn't started her own franchise yet. Yeah.

15:31.200 --> 15:35.600
The show's not called, you know, Glinda, the bounty hunter or whatever. Exactly. That would

15:35.600 --> 15:40.960
be an awesome show though. You just the bounty hunter. I don't know. I like the idea of that

15:40.960 --> 15:46.080
though. There has to, there has to be one. There has to be one. There has to be one. Yeah. Because

15:46.080 --> 15:51.360
they have so many wilds and they could use those wilds to just entrap and snare a fellow. Oh,

15:51.360 --> 16:00.960
they're feminine wilds. Yeah. Yeah. Um, uh, and also like, like, like maybe she's like a super tough

16:01.520 --> 16:06.640
feminine wild woman who collects bounties on heads. Okay.

16:08.320 --> 16:13.440
You know what sucks? You know what job sucks? Tell me. The bounty hunter. You know why?

16:13.440 --> 16:22.880
Why? Cause it's, it's so, so glamorous at first, I bet. Like you see Boba, Boba Fett,

16:24.320 --> 16:29.600
you know, like I wanted that life. I want to be that guy, but it's not all Boba Fett,

16:29.600 --> 16:35.520
but it's not all Boba Fett and slave ones, which was the name of his ship and not a second

16:35.520 --> 16:42.240
endorsement of slavery on our show. Uh, it's all about, you know, jet packs and grappling hooks

16:42.240 --> 16:48.800
and blasters. Yeah. You know, under that Mandalorian armor, nine to five, you know,

16:48.800 --> 16:57.680
just punching the clock. It's all about, yeah. Um, but I like in the real practice of it,

16:57.680 --> 17:03.440
it's just a lot of paper pushing. It's just a lot of, you know, knocking on doors and sternly talking

17:03.440 --> 17:08.640
to a gentleman. Like, and, and if I've learned anything from dog to bunny hunter, then you offer

17:08.640 --> 17:13.680
him a cigarette and then tell him about Jesus. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, I'm going to take you in,

17:13.680 --> 17:18.240
like you are going to the big house, but you can also go to the big house in the sky. When you,

17:19.120 --> 17:24.240
when I kill you, I have good notes. I have good news for you. Well, the bad news is you're going

17:24.240 --> 17:30.880
to jail. The good news is everlasting life. What's up? The question is though, could you ever date

17:30.880 --> 17:40.080
one? Oh no, no. Well, you, what if you committed a crime around them? The bounty. Oh, then it

17:40.080 --> 17:46.160
becomes a Harrison Ford movie. Actually, there's a Gerard Butler, Jennifer Aniston feature. Oh,

17:46.160 --> 17:52.800
gross. Oh no. I pulled that out. Put that away, Griffin. Now what's the name of that hit film?

17:52.800 --> 18:01.840
Uh, it's called a bounty for love. No, it's not. It's called it's really creative. Oh,

18:01.840 --> 18:09.760
it was called friends with bounties, friends with bounties. Um, I think it's called the price on

18:09.760 --> 18:18.560
your head is love. Can you hold my helmet? It's called slave one. It's actually called the bounty

18:18.560 --> 18:27.840
hugger. Yes, we will allow it. Yes. Oh God. Right at the wire. Yeah. Got it in and underneath there.

18:28.480 --> 18:34.480
It's called Jennifer Aniston's done. Everybody wave goodbye to her. She had a good run.

18:36.080 --> 18:44.080
It's called the emasculation of Gerard Butler. The movie in movie form. I think I could love

18:44.080 --> 18:50.400
a bounty hunter. You think you could? I think of course you'd love them. It's about the relationship.

18:50.400 --> 18:56.080
You know what I mean? Could you put up with the long hours and the sitting up at nights wondering

18:56.080 --> 19:00.720
if they've hunted their bounty or not? Yeah. I think I would love her so much that none of that

19:00.720 --> 19:06.800
other stuff would matter. You know, Griffin, I want to say that normally there's a comedy show,

19:06.800 --> 19:12.080
but you've really inspired me today. I want to thank you for that to become a bounty hunter.

19:12.080 --> 19:16.800
You'd be great at it, Justin. You would be phenomenal. You would be. You are insatiable.

19:16.800 --> 19:23.600
You would just tenacious. Yeah. Yeah. You're unswerving. Once you have a mark, you just

19:23.600 --> 19:29.680
chase them down until you get your prize and you send them to heaven. Like when I get my mind's

19:29.680 --> 19:36.160
head on something, I can't be stopped. Yeah. Yeah. And you look damn fine in a bulletproof vest. Like

19:36.160 --> 19:40.400
for instance, right now I really need to use the bathroom and even though we're recording a show,

19:40.400 --> 19:44.240
I'm just going to put my headphones on my mic and go do it and then come right back.

19:44.800 --> 19:47.600
See? No big deal. Unswerving.

19:49.760 --> 19:55.520
Justin? No, he's, he's for real using the bathroom. He's really gone, huh?

19:57.280 --> 20:04.160
Uh, so here's another question. Hey brothers, my friend won't stop spitting. He'll do it wherever

20:04.160 --> 20:09.600
me and my other friends go and it's an extremely annoying and disgusting habit. So I was wondering,

20:09.600 --> 20:14.000
is there any way to stop the spit for good? And that's from Adrian.

20:15.280 --> 20:25.120
I need to talk to everybody. If you, okay, listen, I want to address a specific branch of spitting,

20:25.120 --> 20:28.960
even though I don't know this is what they're specifically talking about, but it is in the

20:28.960 --> 20:33.920
family. I don't endorse the use of any tobacco products except the ones that I myself use.

20:33.920 --> 20:44.320
Mm hmm. Snus. Snuff and pipe. No, no, no. I'm sorry. Snus. Snus? Snus. Hey, everybody stop

20:44.320 --> 20:49.920
dipping. Oh my God. It's the grossest thing. It's the worst thing that ever happened to anybody

20:49.920 --> 20:54.800
when they see you do it. Everybody wants to die and they hate you for doing it. Please stop it.

20:54.800 --> 20:59.440
Sometimes I like to picture like the smartest people in the world, great philosophers and great

20:59.440 --> 21:04.240
scientists, like in the middle of a speech, just reaching down and grabbing their empty Coke bottle

21:04.240 --> 21:08.960
and like just letting some brown spittle dribble out of their mouths. Do you know what a fucking

21:08.960 --> 21:14.560
monster you look like? I'm not joking with you right now. Stop it. There's my anti-dipping

21:15.840 --> 21:23.600
message for the, ugh. If you're going to do it, practice, practice safe chawing. If you're going

21:23.600 --> 21:28.400
to chaw, if you're going to scowl it, like at least be safe and smart about it. I worked in

21:28.400 --> 21:35.120
a movie theater for a while and where, where I was, uh, I was a, uh, not a nusher. What's the,

21:35.120 --> 21:38.720
who are the dudes who like cleaned out? I was one of the dudes who like cleaned the theater out

21:38.720 --> 21:44.240
afterwards. And you were a janitor. I was a janitor basically. Um, but like a custodian,

21:45.360 --> 21:51.120
I was a custodian for the movie theater and I would go in after John Cena's the Marine. I would

21:51.120 --> 21:56.000
go in after that showing. And, uh, this was, this was deep in the heart of West Virginia and there

21:56.000 --> 22:04.960
would be cups, just like those Dixie cups and people would just have them sitting on the floor

22:04.960 --> 22:10.800
and I would come up like sweeping like, oh, let me get this half drunk Dixie cup of Coke out.

22:10.800 --> 22:18.880
Oh no. It's human expectorate. It's fucking, it's, it came from your mouth after you swashed

22:18.880 --> 22:23.920
it around with chaw and scowl. You're fucking gross. Like put the, you couldn't pick that up

22:23.920 --> 22:26.720
and throw it in the garbage can. You couldn't because you don't want people to see you carrying

22:26.720 --> 22:32.400
around a cup of your own spit. Your own warm human spit. Your own warmth. That came from your body

22:32.400 --> 22:40.240
dog. Like I don't come to your house and like fucking jerk off in a, in a, some sort of container

22:40.240 --> 22:45.040
and just like, I'm going to leave this on the floor. We cool. We are not cool. Everyone who

22:45.040 --> 22:51.280
has ever made the argument that smoking looks cool. It's like a million times the opposite

22:51.280 --> 22:58.000
for, for dipping. Like I don't understand the appeal of it. There is no appeal. I would rather

22:58.000 --> 23:05.280
eat a cigar. I'd rather feed a cigar to a baby than have anyone ever dip again. But I think this

23:05.280 --> 23:10.000
person is talking about spit. Just like normal spit. You look when you have it in your lip, even

23:10.640 --> 23:13.680
you look like, you look like you have a tumor. You look like you have a tumor in your face.

23:13.680 --> 23:18.400
You started eating a grape and then you stopped. You just gave up on it. And you said, I'll say

23:18.400 --> 23:22.800
this later. This is mine now. You look like a fucking hamster, only a gross hamster with brown

23:22.800 --> 23:30.160
lips. Go home. Okay. So, but spitting. Here's the thing. I don't even understand why someone would,

23:30.160 --> 23:36.400
I, as much as I don't understand dipping and spitting, why would a human being just spit

23:36.400 --> 23:41.040
for no reason? Like what is stopping them from holding their saliva in their mouth?

23:41.040 --> 23:45.440
Just swallow it. Like we're all walking around swallowing it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's set some

23:45.440 --> 23:48.800
ground rules. Cause we're in some pretty gross territory in this question. I don't want to tread.

23:49.840 --> 23:54.960
Don't say that. No, you do it every day. You just don't think about it. Just regulate your own,

23:54.960 --> 24:00.320
just regulate your fluids without like, without showing him that just don't let things that are

24:00.320 --> 24:05.040
in your body out of your body. Can that be a rule? Just like, I don't want to see, I don't get to

24:05.040 --> 24:10.080
watch. And by get, I mean, have, I don't have to watch you pee or make bathroom. Like I don't have

24:10.080 --> 24:14.560
to make you watch you make bathroom or, or you don't have to watch you pee.

24:14.560 --> 24:22.000
It's a privilege not a right. Yeah. I am not forced to watch you make jerksies, but like,

24:22.000 --> 24:28.000
I don't see anything. If you have a fluid in your body, fucking leave it there. Don't spit in front

24:28.000 --> 24:34.400
of me. Don't pee or, or two in front of me. Don't, don't cry in front of me either. I don't even want

24:34.400 --> 24:40.400
to see you sweat. Okay. But hold on guys. I'm going to turn it around. Unless you're rocking the mic.

24:40.400 --> 24:49.520
I want to turn it around. Okay. I want to bring back spittoons. Oh no, even worse. That's not

24:49.520 --> 24:56.480
science's grossest invention. I think is the spittoon. Cause it gives you an outlet, a receptacle.

24:56.480 --> 25:05.520
Yeah. A community hodgepodge of human spit, a hodge, a miasma of, of human fluid that is mixed

25:05.520 --> 25:11.680
together like a broth, like a rolling broth. It would make daring people to drink stuff more

25:11.680 --> 25:17.200
convenient. Yeah. Cause a lot of times you can just go to the spittoon. A lot of times I want

25:17.200 --> 25:22.000
to dare someone to drink something and I don't have anything really good there. And if I try to

25:22.000 --> 25:26.480
do something weird, Pepsi's probably already made a soda based on it. Like there's not a lot of

25:26.480 --> 25:32.320
options anymore. People like so many weird things. Can we, can we, let's, let's build off of this.

25:32.320 --> 25:36.960
Can we make a private spittoon? Like a secret spittoon? If you do absolutely need to spit.

25:37.600 --> 25:41.840
You mean like a mask? Like, like it hangs on your face?

25:41.840 --> 25:45.280
No. Cause I don't, then people would still have to see it. I'm talking about like a flask,

25:45.280 --> 25:48.720
like a secret flask that you spit into very discreetly. Even that's going to be kind of

25:48.720 --> 25:53.440
gross though. I was thinking more like a gas mask where it was like a full face thing.

25:53.440 --> 25:57.280
And so then the receptacle is right below your mouth and no one could see it or you.

25:57.280 --> 26:00.800
That would be pretty good. What about like a, well, you know how we have, you know,

26:00.800 --> 26:07.200
you have a St. Bernard with the barrel of hot cocoa, um, on, around his neck. You could just

26:07.200 --> 26:10.560
have something like that, but it would be a spittoon. Like a cask, like a spit pendant?

26:10.560 --> 26:13.920
Are you saying like a dog that follows you around and you spit on the dog?

26:13.920 --> 26:18.480
Has anybody ever seen a dog? No! What? What? No!

26:19.920 --> 26:25.040
Like my spittle, St. Bernard, spit, spit, spit. That's the saddest dog life.

26:25.040 --> 26:29.200
Your dog looks really sad. All the time. Really sad and moist.

26:29.200 --> 26:31.920
Yeah. I spit on my dog all the time.

26:33.120 --> 26:37.120
Um, it's a living. It's a living though.

26:38.560 --> 26:46.080
It's like you're spitting on your dog. Tell your friend to stop spitting on their dog.

26:46.080 --> 26:49.760
And every time they spit, I want them to imagine a St. Bernard's there,

26:49.760 --> 26:52.880
you know, with the cask and what all. Like they're spitting on him.

26:52.880 --> 26:59.200
Um, just remember Jesus is all around us. So every time you spit, you're spitting on him,

26:59.200 --> 27:00.320
technically. Yep.

27:00.320 --> 27:03.040
And if you believe your grandparents are all around us watching you,

27:03.600 --> 27:06.560
after they pass away, you're spitting on everyone's dead grandparents.

27:06.560 --> 27:11.120
Oh, wouldn't that be dope if you spit and like it just sort of hung in the air and you're like,

27:11.120 --> 27:14.240
what? They'd be like, oh, you spit on grandpa. He's like, you found me.

27:14.240 --> 27:23.200
Darn you kids. I was going to watch the Marine with you.

27:25.040 --> 27:30.320
But now I'm caught and have to go to hell. Um, listen, let's move on.

27:31.440 --> 27:31.760
Yep.

27:31.760 --> 27:36.800
Don't fucking spit. What you do is if your friend spits, you go to where you go and you

27:36.800 --> 27:40.240
pick up his leavings and you rub it on his nose and you say no.

27:40.240 --> 27:46.400
I think it's a justifiable experience. I think it's justifiable to just smack him in the face.

27:46.960 --> 27:52.000
Every time he does, it's just so uncalled for to just spit on the ground wherever you happen to be.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.560
When he does it, you smack him just like every time. I guarantee that will stop so fast.

27:56.560 --> 27:59.760
Push his nose into his leavings. That's the only thing you can do.

28:00.880 --> 28:03.120
No, no, no.

28:03.680 --> 28:05.520
Shake the no-no can at him also.

28:05.520 --> 28:06.080
Yeah.

28:06.080 --> 28:11.440
Um, well, I don't have a good transition for this, but money's out.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.160
Hey, Joe Willans called us.

28:24.160 --> 28:29.920
He wanted us to wish his friend James Bannon a very, very happy birthday.

28:29.920 --> 28:30.160
Hey.

28:31.200 --> 28:31.600
Yeah.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.200
Hey, Jim, James.

28:33.200 --> 28:38.480
I'll go with James. James studied math and English lit at Swarthmore College.

28:38.480 --> 28:39.520
Plays guitar.

28:39.520 --> 28:44.240
It's Big 21, and he's the one who got Joe into our show.

28:44.240 --> 28:46.640
So thanks, James, for spreading the word.

28:46.640 --> 28:50.640
Can we suggest Joe a kickoff drink into this new world that he's entering into?

28:50.640 --> 28:54.000
And Justin, if you say Code Red and Vodka, I am going to quit the show.

28:54.960 --> 28:55.280
Okay.

28:55.280 --> 28:59.760
Well, let me suggest maybe Mountain Dew and a little bit of grenadine and vodka.

28:59.760 --> 29:04.800
Yeah. Okay, what you just described is some sort of home-brewed Code Red.

29:06.480 --> 29:07.360
Your own blend.

29:08.080 --> 29:11.840
You're talking about DIY nerd beverages.

29:12.880 --> 29:15.040
Yeah, DIY, your own blend.

29:15.040 --> 29:19.680
I actually just invented a new drink that I would suggest called the Southern Gentleman.

29:20.560 --> 29:21.440
No, it's delicious.

29:21.440 --> 29:27.520
It's a Bombay Sapphire Gin and a sweet tea and a little bit of lemon.

29:28.160 --> 29:29.040
Oh, I've had one of those.

29:29.040 --> 29:30.480
You mean a Frat House Blackout?

29:32.640 --> 29:34.880
No, it's delicious and it goes down smooth,

29:34.880 --> 29:37.920
and you drink it on your back porch while you appreciate having land.

29:37.920 --> 29:42.400
When do you put mustard and salt and cheese on it and jalapenos?

29:42.400 --> 29:43.360
That's the third one.

29:43.360 --> 29:46.320
And then you pour the drink on a bagel and you just party down.

29:47.040 --> 29:47.680
Yep.

29:47.680 --> 29:48.560
And I puke on you.

29:49.120 --> 29:53.200
By the way, the one time it's permissible to spit is when Travis makes you some food

29:53.200 --> 29:54.560
and feeds it to you.

29:54.560 --> 29:58.640
When you take a bite of Travis's lunch, you will biologically need to spit that out.

29:58.640 --> 30:02.640
I imagine the sandwiches I make are like the sweet embrace of death,

30:02.640 --> 30:05.600
where you're just so happy to go, but you know it's the end.

30:05.600 --> 30:07.520
What's the opposite of a recovery sandwich?

30:09.200 --> 30:10.400
The punishment sandwich.

30:10.400 --> 30:13.680
A de-habilitation sandwich is what Travis crashed.

30:16.320 --> 30:17.280
I feel lonelier.

30:18.480 --> 30:20.080
I feel lonelier from reading this.

30:21.600 --> 30:24.160
This is a backwards concoction I made.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.320
So thank you to Joe.

30:26.320 --> 30:30.960
So if you'd like to wish someone a happy birthday or promote your business or what have you,

30:38.960 --> 30:39.460
What?

30:39.920 --> 30:41.680
Oh yeah, that would go down smooth.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.720
This one was sent in by Brussels Sprout.

30:45.760 --> 30:48.800
Probably not a real Christian name, but we'll roll with it.

30:48.800 --> 30:49.680
Thank you, Brussels Sprout.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.120
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

30:51.120 --> 30:56.400
Here, mycollegefund1988 asks,

30:58.400 --> 31:00.400
can I sneak my cat on a plane?

31:02.400 --> 31:04.320
She is a kitten, about a month old,

31:04.320 --> 31:06.880
and I was thinking of putting her in my pocket while I went through security.

31:06.880 --> 31:10.080
My pocket is loose, and since she'll be on me,

31:10.080 --> 31:13.680
she won't be on my stuff that's being x-rayed.

31:13.680 --> 31:16.240
All I have to do is walk through a metal detector.

31:16.240 --> 31:18.000
Do you think this is possible?

31:19.520 --> 31:20.400
What the fuck?

31:20.400 --> 31:21.520
What the fuck?

31:21.520 --> 31:22.400
What the fuck?

31:23.840 --> 31:25.120
What life are you living?

31:26.000 --> 31:27.520
How much do you love that kitty?

31:29.120 --> 31:31.920
How much do you simultaneously love-hate your cat

31:31.920 --> 31:33.440
that you want it to be with you,

31:33.440 --> 31:36.240
but you also want it in your pocket for x hours?

31:36.240 --> 31:37.040
Yeah.

31:37.040 --> 31:37.680
Oh god.

31:38.480 --> 31:41.680
This is like a baby with a cup full of bleach.

31:41.680 --> 31:43.760
I just want to smack it away from it and be like,

31:43.760 --> 31:45.440
no, you can't have that cat.

31:45.440 --> 31:46.880
Don't you see the Mr. Yuck sticker?

31:47.920 --> 31:48.400
You will die.

31:48.400 --> 31:48.960
Oh god.

31:48.960 --> 31:51.120
Oh, Jesus.

31:51.120 --> 31:52.960
So how can we make this happen?

31:53.680 --> 31:54.240
How can we-

31:54.240 --> 31:55.840
Clearly, it's the cat hat.

31:55.840 --> 31:58.880
It's a big cowboy hat, and the cat sits underneath the hat.

31:59.680 --> 32:00.000
Yeah.

32:00.000 --> 32:00.800
I'm pretty sure you have to take those off.

32:00.800 --> 32:01.360
I like that.

32:02.320 --> 32:03.280
Let's take it off.

32:03.280 --> 32:03.840
As charming as that would be-

32:03.840 --> 32:04.640
No, you tell him it's-

32:04.640 --> 32:06.640
Sir, you have to take off that 10 gallon hat.

32:06.640 --> 32:08.320
Well, first of all, it's illegal.

32:08.320 --> 32:09.280
Second of all, it's ridiculous.

32:09.280 --> 32:10.400
Tell him it's prescription.

32:10.400 --> 32:12.880
And you say, sure thing, madam, and you take it off,

32:12.880 --> 32:15.040
and your cat is standing perfectly on your head.

32:15.040 --> 32:15.540
Oh.

32:15.540 --> 32:17.860
No, the cat's doing that thing where it's holding its arms

32:17.860 --> 32:19.700
and legs up against the sides of the hat,

32:19.700 --> 32:21.220
and keeping itself inside the hat.

32:21.220 --> 32:22.740
And it's like, well, this looks okay.

32:22.740 --> 32:24.580
And you put the hat back on, and that's how the cat-

32:24.580 --> 32:27.540
And it has its own smaller cowboy hat on it.

32:30.180 --> 32:31.300
Yee-haw.

32:31.300 --> 32:33.060
I'm not even helping anymore,

32:33.060 --> 32:35.060
but I'm just making beautiful tableaus.

32:37.300 --> 32:39.060
These tableaus are pretty beautiful.

32:39.060 --> 32:42.660
There is, of course, a pretty obvious problem with this plan

32:42.660 --> 32:44.100
that we're not making.

32:44.100 --> 32:47.300
Problem with this plan that we're not dealing with here,

32:47.300 --> 32:49.220
and that's cats have metal skeletons.

32:50.340 --> 32:52.340
You see a cat jump off of something high,

32:53.060 --> 32:55.380
you don't hear the snapping of bones,

32:55.380 --> 32:57.540
you hear the clanging of metal on metal.

32:59.060 --> 33:01.620
That's how they're able to survive falls from great distances,

33:01.620 --> 33:03.940
is cats have metal skeletons.

33:03.940 --> 33:06.340
You're gonna have to get those bones out of that cat.

33:09.540 --> 33:12.820
Can you put the cat's bones in your checked luggage?

33:12.820 --> 33:13.620
Mm-hmm.

33:13.620 --> 33:15.060
Oh, who are we fucking kidding?

33:15.060 --> 33:16.580
This guy's not gonna get a cat carrier,

33:16.580 --> 33:18.100
but he's gonna spring the checker bag.

33:18.100 --> 33:19.380
No, he's going full carry-on.

33:19.380 --> 33:19.860
But the problem is-

33:19.860 --> 33:20.900
Let me suggest-

33:20.900 --> 33:22.820
It's not the transporting the cat.

33:22.820 --> 33:23.940
He cannot go.

33:23.940 --> 33:28.340
He is flying from fucking Denver to Seattle,

33:28.340 --> 33:29.940
and he needs to have that cat with him

33:29.940 --> 33:30.980
for that three-hour journey.

33:30.980 --> 33:31.300
Yeah.

33:31.300 --> 33:32.580
Okay, I've got it.

33:32.580 --> 33:34.500
Tell the airline it's a service animal.

33:34.500 --> 33:36.020
Okay, how can we do this?

33:36.020 --> 33:36.740
What is this cat doing?

33:36.740 --> 33:38.020
This is my service kitten.

33:38.020 --> 33:42.260
I- I have a severe nuzzle deficiency.

33:42.260 --> 33:46.260
And sometimes I need to get snuggled out mid-flight.

33:46.260 --> 33:48.500
Is anybody on this plane capable of snuggling?

33:50.020 --> 33:51.700
Is there a snuggler on the plane?

33:51.700 --> 33:53.300
This man took the bones out of his cat.

33:53.300 --> 33:55.780
It is no longer capable of anything.

33:56.580 --> 33:57.620
It is a cat bag.

34:01.540 --> 34:04.580
Boy, how- how much is he going to regret-

34:04.580 --> 34:07.540
regret wearing his My Kitty's the Bomb t-shirt?

34:07.540 --> 34:08.340
Oh, no.

34:08.340 --> 34:09.620
Why did you even pick that one?

34:11.460 --> 34:15.220
That's going to make for some awkward conversation with the- with the guy.

34:16.580 --> 34:18.180
And cats are weapons, by the way.

34:18.180 --> 34:18.740
Duh.

34:18.740 --> 34:19.220
Yeah.

34:19.220 --> 34:23.220
I feel like this person isn't really thinking through the end game of this question.

34:23.860 --> 34:24.020
Like-

34:24.020 --> 34:25.380
Oh, you mean a cat funeral?

34:25.380 --> 34:26.820
For your baby kitten?

34:26.820 --> 34:27.940
Because you had it in your pocket?

34:28.980 --> 34:32.100
And its brains exploded when the cabin was pressurized?

34:32.100 --> 34:32.420
Yeah.

34:34.260 --> 34:35.300
Oh, God.

34:35.300 --> 34:36.740
I hate this person.

34:36.740 --> 34:36.980
Like-

34:36.980 --> 34:37.700
I hate him, too.

34:37.700 --> 34:39.700
What if your pilot is allergic to cats?

34:40.260 --> 34:42.340
Didn't think about that one, did you?

34:42.340 --> 34:45.860
What are you going to do when- when mewing starts coming from your pockets?

34:46.500 --> 34:47.220
What are you going to do?

34:47.220 --> 34:47.860
He's going to know.

34:48.420 --> 34:51.860
Although it does make for the cutest sequel to Snakes on a Plane.

34:51.860 --> 34:52.100
Yeah.

34:53.140 --> 34:54.260
Single kitten on a plane?

34:55.140 --> 34:58.660
I gotta get this motherfucking adorable ass kitten off this motherfucking plane.

34:58.660 --> 35:02.020
I need to get this fucking adorable single kitten.

35:02.980 --> 35:03.620
Just the one.

35:03.620 --> 35:06.500
Just the one salt-and-pepper fur.

35:07.860 --> 35:10.340
This sweet, precious tabby pussy.

35:10.980 --> 35:12.420
Get him off the plane.

35:12.420 --> 35:13.380
Open that door.

35:17.380 --> 35:18.980
Ladies and gentlemen, Cobra Starship.

35:20.500 --> 35:21.460
Play us out.

35:21.460 --> 35:25.380
Can you- can you- can you drug-mule this cat?

35:27.380 --> 35:30.340
Are you saying put the cat up your butt?

35:30.340 --> 35:30.900
No.

35:30.900 --> 35:37.860
Can you put the cat in a shampoo bottle in your butt?

35:37.860 --> 35:38.820
Is that what you're saying?

35:38.820 --> 35:43.540
I- it doesn't have to- you guys are not- you guys are not aware of the recent developments

35:43.540 --> 35:45.380
in drug-mule technology.

35:45.380 --> 35:47.460
Oh, okay, put the cat in your urethra.

35:47.460 --> 35:48.580
Yeah, put it right in your wiener.

35:48.580 --> 35:51.140
Oh, oh, oh, it's in my- oh, the picture!

35:52.500 --> 35:53.460
Oh, the picture's in there.

35:54.740 --> 35:58.180
Just do like I do at the buffet and put it in a sandwich bag.

35:59.140 --> 36:00.660
And in your cargo pants.

36:00.660 --> 36:02.100
And put it in your cargo pants.

36:02.100 --> 36:03.780
That's what cargo pants are for.

36:03.780 --> 36:04.740
Is this a tiny kitty?

36:04.740 --> 36:05.780
Can you keep them in your mouth?

36:06.500 --> 36:07.700
Sir, you're being very quiet.

36:11.540 --> 36:13.300
Sir, can I get you anything to drink?

36:13.300 --> 36:13.700
Milk.

36:17.300 --> 36:17.620
Cat formula.

36:17.620 --> 36:18.420
And sardines.

36:20.500 --> 36:21.700
Sardines, if you have them.

36:23.220 --> 36:27.380
What about buying him an extra ticket and then dressing him like a tiny human being?

36:28.180 --> 36:29.380
Ah, I love it.

36:29.380 --> 36:30.420
This is gonna be great.

36:30.420 --> 36:31.700
Especially if it's a Garfield.

36:32.260 --> 36:33.700
Especially if it's a bipedal cat.

36:34.740 --> 36:35.700
With human features.

36:35.700 --> 36:39.140
Oh, and he's wearing a tiny suit and you make him look like a foreigner.

36:39.940 --> 36:43.380
And that's why he doesn't speak any English and you translate for him.

36:43.380 --> 36:43.700
Okay.

36:44.340 --> 36:44.660
Okay.

36:46.580 --> 36:50.100
I think that this person doesn't want to buy an extra ticket

36:50.100 --> 36:53.780
because they could probably just put the goddamn cat in a box and buy it a ticket.

36:53.780 --> 36:54.420
Yeah.

36:54.420 --> 36:54.740
Right?

36:55.300 --> 36:56.580
Isn't that the way these things work?

36:56.580 --> 37:01.060
Cats are- cats are so low maintenance you could just fucking FedEx them to your- to your final

37:01.060 --> 37:01.780
destination.

37:02.500 --> 37:04.580
Just do what the cat wants and let it go.

37:04.580 --> 37:06.980
Just open your front door and let the cat be free.

37:06.980 --> 37:08.500
That's what the cat wants to do.

37:08.500 --> 37:11.780
If he loves you, he will find you at your final destination.

37:11.780 --> 37:13.060
Fucking homeward bound style.

37:13.860 --> 37:14.660
Fuck yes.

37:15.620 --> 37:16.500
That would be way harder.

37:16.500 --> 37:17.540
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

37:17.540 --> 37:19.300
Why are you even flying with the cat?

37:19.860 --> 37:21.300
Just homeward bound it.

37:21.300 --> 37:25.140
It's gonna be- it'll leave the door open, it will homeward bound it to you.

37:25.140 --> 37:28.580
Let it get- And then on your return trip, it'll homeward bound back.

37:28.580 --> 37:33.300
Let him get a real good whiff of your musk and then just let him trace you through the sky.

37:34.420 --> 37:34.740
Yeah.

37:34.740 --> 37:37.060
Just pray to God he doesn't Milo and Otis it.

37:37.060 --> 37:37.620
Oh no.

37:38.500 --> 37:39.460
Oh no.

37:39.460 --> 37:40.020
That's a bad scene.

37:40.020 --> 37:42.260
You really don't want this cat to Marley and me it.

37:45.780 --> 37:47.060
Air Bud would be cool though.

37:48.020 --> 37:49.300
Let your cat play some sports.

37:49.300 --> 37:55.460
Hey, what are a few not incredibly obvious ways of finding out if a girl you like has a boyfriend

37:55.460 --> 37:55.960
or not?

37:56.260 --> 38:01.220
I'm currently in university and don't really know how to bring up that topic without the girl

38:01.220 --> 38:02.820
realizing that I'm into her.

38:02.820 --> 38:04.980
That's from Con Fuzzled in Cincinnati.

38:06.020 --> 38:06.980
You goofster.

38:07.860 --> 38:09.060
Why- I have a theory.

38:10.660 --> 38:10.900
Let's hear it.

38:10.900 --> 38:17.860
That I would like you guys to- to refute or agree with and that is that if the girl has a boyfriend

38:17.860 --> 38:24.180
and she is not into you, she will mention it awkwardly like in the first four sentences.

38:26.980 --> 38:27.540
Am I wrong?

38:27.540 --> 38:29.460
But she'll be like, talk, talk, talk.

38:29.460 --> 38:32.100
Well, I guess I better go meet my boyfriend.

38:32.100 --> 38:33.620
No, no, I don't think that.

38:33.620 --> 38:37.780
Well, it depends on what kind of girl are we talking about?

38:37.780 --> 38:42.740
Because if she's- if she's the kind of person who thinks that everybody is into them,

38:43.780 --> 38:46.500
then first off, you shouldn't be- you shouldn't be pursuing her.

38:46.500 --> 38:48.420
Because that's not an attractive trait.

38:49.620 --> 38:50.100
I don't know.

38:50.100 --> 38:53.300
That seems like it would put like more people off than it would-

38:55.380 --> 38:56.020
I don't know, Trav.

38:56.020 --> 38:56.980
I don't think that's true.

38:57.940 --> 38:59.860
I have a really- I have a really cool move.

38:59.860 --> 39:00.360
Okay.

39:02.100 --> 39:02.740
Ask her out.

39:03.300 --> 39:07.940
Yeah, that's- you gotta- why are you afraid of letting her realize that you're into her?

39:07.940 --> 39:08.340
Like that's-

39:08.340 --> 39:09.860
Can I- can I make a metaphor here?

39:09.860 --> 39:14.740
Like- but that's like rather than asking someone if they're allergic to peanuts,

39:14.740 --> 39:16.740
just shoving some peanuts in their face.

39:16.740 --> 39:18.020
No, it's not like that.

39:18.020 --> 39:19.220
It's like asking them out.

39:19.220 --> 39:21.540
And then think about this move, okay?

39:21.540 --> 39:22.180
You ask her out.

39:22.180 --> 39:24.180
She says, yes, you're on a date, get married, have kids.

39:24.180 --> 39:25.060
It's wonderful.

39:25.060 --> 39:25.620
You ask her out.

39:25.620 --> 39:26.420
She has a boyfriend.

39:27.620 --> 39:28.660
Yeah, later.

39:28.660 --> 39:29.700
No, you ask her out.

39:29.700 --> 39:30.820
She says, I got a boyfriend.

39:30.820 --> 39:33.700
You look her dead in the eye and you say, the question stands.

39:33.700 --> 39:34.260
Oh my god.

39:34.260 --> 39:37.220
Oh, that is kind of badass.

39:37.220 --> 39:38.580
How smooth would that be?

39:39.940 --> 39:41.220
That is pretty awesome.

39:41.220 --> 39:42.660
You won't sell it.

39:42.660 --> 39:43.300
No, no, no.

39:43.300 --> 39:44.420
I'm reading your question.

39:44.420 --> 39:44.820
You're not-

39:44.820 --> 39:46.820
Yeah, it's not going to work for you.

39:46.820 --> 39:48.180
And then she'll be like, okay.

39:48.180 --> 39:49.380
And you'll be like, oh, I can't.

39:49.380 --> 39:50.740
I can't be party to cheating.

39:50.740 --> 39:51.780
And then you walk away.

39:51.780 --> 39:53.380
How's your double power play?

39:54.260 --> 39:59.140
Oh, you just convinced her to sin and then threw the sin back in her face.

39:59.140 --> 39:59.700
That move is going to be so-

39:59.700 --> 40:02.180
You're going to be alone tonight, but it's a moral victory.

40:02.180 --> 40:03.220
Move is going to be so dope.

40:03.220 --> 40:07.380
You're going to need a hype man to like walk behind you like, what, what, what?

40:07.380 --> 40:15.540
Get parts, pick up your face.

40:15.540 --> 40:20.420
Have you guys ever been in a conversation with a member of the opposite sex and they

40:20.420 --> 40:25.540
will work into the conversation that they have a boyfriend or a girlfriend, I guess,

40:25.540 --> 40:31.140
if you were a girl and you know that they're saying that so you won't ask them out, but

40:31.140 --> 40:32.820
you weren't that interested in the first place.

40:32.820 --> 40:33.380
Yeah.

40:33.380 --> 40:34.100
You guys ever had that?

40:34.100 --> 40:34.660
I love that.

40:34.660 --> 40:37.700
But then I get, I get affronted at that point.

40:37.700 --> 40:38.020
It's like-

40:38.020 --> 40:40.020
I wasn't going to, but now I can't.

40:40.980 --> 40:42.100
Well, now I'm just mad.

40:42.660 --> 40:47.060
And then I ask them out, like, I'm like, uh, so do you want to get coffee?

40:47.060 --> 40:49.780
And they're like, I just mentioned I had a boyfriend.

40:49.780 --> 40:50.740
I'm like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:50.740 --> 40:51.140
I get that.

40:51.140 --> 40:51.540
I get that.

40:51.540 --> 40:53.620
So you like a movie or dinner?

40:53.620 --> 40:56.500
Do you know what is fucking horse apples?

40:56.500 --> 41:05.540
Do you know what is fucking horse apples is that we had to deal with that shit.

41:05.540 --> 41:08.260
Like me, probably all the way up through high school.

41:09.540 --> 41:15.380
But now that Facebook's up and it's like, you know who is fucking who and who's kissing

41:15.380 --> 41:17.620
and who's necking who's smooching.

41:17.620 --> 41:20.340
Like there's not a questioning.

41:20.340 --> 41:21.940
It's so unambiguous.

41:21.940 --> 41:24.020
Everybody knows what is up with everybody else's business.

41:24.020 --> 41:27.300
Unless, unless it's complicated.

41:28.340 --> 41:29.940
We've already talked about that before.

41:29.940 --> 41:33.780
That just means that they're, they're, they're still fucking, but they want that drama.

41:33.780 --> 41:34.820
They love that drama.

41:35.860 --> 41:36.100
Yeah.

41:38.100 --> 41:39.860
Everybody knows what everybody else is doing.

41:39.860 --> 41:41.060
This is not a problem anymore.

41:41.060 --> 41:42.420
I think this guy's telling tales.

41:43.620 --> 41:43.860
Okay.

41:43.860 --> 41:46.100
So you think get on Facebook, check her status.

41:46.100 --> 41:46.260
Yeah.

41:46.260 --> 41:47.300
Here's an easy way to do it.

41:47.300 --> 41:51.220
Get on Facebook and check the part where it says whether or not she's dating anybody.

41:51.220 --> 41:54.900
And if it says she doesn't, then you ask her out and she says she is.

41:54.900 --> 41:57.460
And so you should be like, well, you should update your Facebook better.

41:57.460 --> 41:58.900
And you turn and walk away.

41:59.540 --> 42:00.980
And I'm going to throw this out.

42:00.980 --> 42:06.260
If you don't know if she has a boyfriend or not, which is like a pretty serious thing.

42:06.260 --> 42:08.660
You don't know her well enough to say that you like her.

42:09.780 --> 42:11.460
Well, I don't think that's true.

42:11.460 --> 42:12.180
I do.

42:12.180 --> 42:17.220
It only takes a moment.

42:17.220 --> 42:25.620
But I think it's the parlor if he said a girl I'm attracted to, but not a girl that he likes.

42:25.620 --> 42:26.500
Like, he doesn't know.

42:26.500 --> 42:27.780
He's not into her.

42:27.780 --> 42:28.820
He's attracted to her.

42:28.820 --> 42:34.180
This bitch can't get on Facebook and you think that you're going to fix his vocab.

42:34.180 --> 42:35.700
Like, come on, cut him some slack.

42:35.700 --> 42:36.820
He's trying to get his shit together.

42:38.020 --> 42:38.580
Fair enough.

42:40.260 --> 42:42.100
Hey, listen, I'm sorry Confuzzled.

42:42.100 --> 42:42.980
I'm sorry about that.

42:42.980 --> 42:44.420
I'm sorry things got heated in here.

42:45.060 --> 42:46.500
Just get on Facebook.

42:46.500 --> 42:47.540
Tweet at her.

42:47.540 --> 42:50.260
Tweet at her and find out her status, her Twitter status.

42:51.860 --> 42:52.900
Get on Facebook.

42:52.900 --> 42:59.060
Look at every picture of her that's ever been taken and look for fucking common dudes.

42:59.060 --> 43:01.380
Like a dude who, a repeated dude.

43:01.380 --> 43:02.900
Like, oh, that dude's in a lot of pictures.

43:02.900 --> 43:03.780
They're probably-

43:03.780 --> 43:06.020
Which is also my favorite mathematic principle.

43:06.020 --> 43:07.780
Yeah, the lowest common dude.

43:07.780 --> 43:08.820
The repeating dude.

43:08.820 --> 43:09.060
Yeah.

43:10.020 --> 43:14.180
You know, you can also say, hey, my girlfriend and I want to know if you and your boyfriend

43:14.180 --> 43:15.220
want to go on a double date.

43:15.220 --> 43:18.420
And then when she says you don't have a boyfriend, say, I made mine up too.

43:18.420 --> 43:19.220
Let's go out.

43:19.220 --> 43:20.740
We have so much in common.

43:22.500 --> 43:24.260
This is- I'm going to go.

43:24.900 --> 43:29.140
My girlfriend and I want to know if you want to come to a couple's ministry with me and

43:29.140 --> 43:32.260
her because she's real and you and your boyfriend.

43:32.260 --> 43:34.100
Oh, and then it becomes an Adam Sandler movie.

43:35.300 --> 43:37.220
Yeah, then you have to pay somebody.

43:37.220 --> 43:39.220
But you already own a whore, right Travis?

43:39.220 --> 43:39.540
Yep.

43:39.540 --> 43:40.980
What's- hey, perfect.

43:40.980 --> 43:42.820
Well, I'm still paying it off.

43:42.820 --> 43:43.380
Yeah, right.

43:43.380 --> 43:48.580
Yeah, I'm a senior in college and this semester I've nabbed one of the much coveted single

43:48.580 --> 43:49.080
rooms.

43:49.700 --> 43:52.820
Issue is, this is my first time in my life I've ever lived alone.

43:53.460 --> 43:57.140
I'm five days in and I can already feel my mental health slipping away.

43:57.140 --> 44:00.100
Any tips on surviving the lonely times?

44:00.100 --> 44:01.060
That's from Nick.

44:01.060 --> 44:02.100
I've got a great tip.

44:02.900 --> 44:04.980
Go find a roommate before you hang yourself.

44:07.620 --> 44:08.900
I've never tried this.

44:08.900 --> 44:10.900
I don't know how well I would adjust to it.

44:10.900 --> 44:12.180
This is not a joke.

44:12.180 --> 44:19.300
I did it for about three months and it was so miserable that one of my friends moved

44:19.300 --> 44:20.100
in with me.

44:20.820 --> 44:25.220
I did it for about three months and lost my mind to the point where I was just walking

44:25.220 --> 44:28.660
around talking to myself out loud all the time.

44:29.620 --> 44:33.620
Your best bet is gonna be- and like I have some experience with this.

44:33.620 --> 44:38.500
I don't live alone, but like I work at my house and pretty much all my, you know, day

44:38.500 --> 44:39.540
to day is like here.

44:39.540 --> 44:41.220
You know, day to day is like here.

44:42.980 --> 44:46.820
I find that you got to get out as much as humanly possible.

44:46.820 --> 44:48.660
Like go to Starbucks.

44:48.660 --> 44:50.420
Don't sit at home and watch a movie.

44:50.420 --> 44:51.700
Like go to the theater.

44:51.700 --> 44:53.060
Like just be around people.

44:54.340 --> 44:55.700
But my folly.

44:55.700 --> 44:57.300
I mean, we're not reinventing the wheel here.

44:57.300 --> 45:00.260
You ever see old men by themselves and they look happy?

45:00.900 --> 45:02.180
No, they don't.

45:02.180 --> 45:02.900
They're alone.

45:02.900 --> 45:03.940
They're lonely.

45:03.940 --> 45:05.700
Like when you live alone, you get lonely.

45:05.700 --> 45:08.900
That's that's sort of like the operative word there.

45:08.900 --> 45:10.020
Yep. Yeah, right.

45:10.020 --> 45:15.460
I feel that living alone is like one of those like for me it's like going to the pool where

45:15.460 --> 45:19.540
it seems like such a good idea and then you do it and like five minutes in you're like,

45:19.540 --> 45:21.060
oh, yeah, this is boring.

45:21.060 --> 45:24.260
Oh, oh, I don't know why I was so excited about this in the first place.

45:24.260 --> 45:24.980
Quick anecdote.

45:24.980 --> 45:26.900
Have you guys ever gone to the pool by yourself?

45:28.100 --> 45:33.060
It is super hard to do that and not feel like a total pedophile.

45:34.420 --> 45:34.980
Oh, yeah.

45:34.980 --> 45:37.860
I think if you're alone at a pool, I think people are looking at you like, oh, that's

45:37.860 --> 45:39.620
a there's a pedophile confirmed.

45:39.620 --> 45:43.060
You know, I feel the same way about going to magic quest by myself.

45:43.060 --> 45:48.900
Well, yeah, that that probably is a little more sustainable.

45:48.900 --> 45:51.940
I think that's a supportable theory there.

45:51.940 --> 46:01.220
Here's the here's this was my folly is that by going out by leaving your house, a good

46:01.220 --> 46:08.580
substitution for that is not going out into the magical world of Azeroth to go on and

46:08.580 --> 46:10.900
online adventures with your with your e-buddies.

46:12.100 --> 46:18.500
That is not that was not a good substitution, not a good supplement for the real deal.

46:18.500 --> 46:18.740
Right.

46:19.620 --> 46:20.180
So don't do that.

46:20.180 --> 46:20.900
This is key.

46:21.540 --> 46:22.580
Don't do that.

46:22.580 --> 46:25.460
This is so lose yourself in the world of computer games.

46:26.660 --> 46:27.460
You got to leave the house.

46:27.460 --> 46:28.900
You got to take up a hobby.

46:28.900 --> 46:30.660
You got to find a roommate.

46:30.660 --> 46:31.540
Go quick.

46:31.540 --> 46:32.100
Yep.

46:32.100 --> 46:34.740
Quick before the semester is it gets too deep in.

46:34.740 --> 46:35.940
Stop and stop.

46:36.820 --> 46:41.780
What happened to me in that three months I live by myself is I was constantly contacting

46:41.780 --> 46:42.500
everyone I knew.

46:42.500 --> 46:43.700
Be like, do you guys want to come over?

46:43.700 --> 46:44.820
I can come over there.

46:44.820 --> 46:46.900
We go grab some pizza, get a beer, whatever.

46:46.900 --> 46:49.060
And eventually I burned out everyone.

46:49.940 --> 46:50.820
Do you want to come here?

46:50.820 --> 46:52.420
Just come sit with me, please.

46:52.420 --> 46:53.220
Just sit here.

46:53.220 --> 46:57.380
Be another living person in the same 10 feet square as me, please.

46:57.380 --> 46:59.380
Travis, are you trying to hold my hand right now?

46:59.380 --> 47:02.580
When, uh, when you guys are done swimming, you kids want to come by.

47:02.580 --> 47:04.100
I got some like cheese balls.

47:04.100 --> 47:05.300
We could watch a movie or whatever.

47:05.300 --> 47:06.180
See what's on TBS.

47:06.900 --> 47:08.500
Got some code red Mountain Dew.

47:08.500 --> 47:09.780
Just see what happens.

47:09.780 --> 47:10.740
It's a Mountain Dew ingredient.

47:10.740 --> 47:11.380
Just make your own.

47:11.380 --> 47:12.100
It's no big deal.

47:12.100 --> 47:13.140
You know what you should do, actually?

47:14.180 --> 47:14.420
What?

47:14.980 --> 47:16.340
Just get super lonely this year.

47:16.980 --> 47:22.020
Just take it always seem to go that you don't know what you got till it's gone.

47:22.020 --> 47:22.660
Here's the problem.

47:23.780 --> 47:26.660
The only problem is it is your senior year of college and you're supposed to be making

47:26.660 --> 47:28.420
memories and stuff doing all that shit.

47:28.420 --> 47:33.220
But, um, so it's unfortunate that these two stars have aligned in this manner, but you

47:33.220 --> 47:34.340
gotta have a lonely year.

47:35.300 --> 47:41.060
I think we all have a lonely year and that that lonely year is so important to your,

47:41.060 --> 47:43.300
to your formation as a human being, as a man.

47:43.300 --> 47:45.700
Do you know who I bet has a lot of strong memories?

47:45.700 --> 47:46.100
Who's that?

47:46.900 --> 47:49.060
Uh, Tom Hanks character in Castaway.

47:49.060 --> 47:49.620
Yeah, sure.

47:50.900 --> 47:55.300
Tom Hanks character in Castaway knows exactly who Tom Hanks character in Castaway is, even

47:55.300 --> 47:58.340
though we cannot recall his name.

47:58.340 --> 47:59.380
It's Wilson.

47:59.380 --> 48:00.020
Yeah.

48:00.020 --> 48:01.540
That was yes.

48:01.540 --> 48:02.820
Wilson and Wilson Jr.

48:02.820 --> 48:05.380
I think that the two main characters of that movie.

48:08.180 --> 48:11.380
God, that movie would have been so much better if he thought the volleyball was his son.

48:14.100 --> 48:16.580
Is it too early to do a remake of that movie?

48:16.580 --> 48:16.980
Nope.

48:16.980 --> 48:20.100
Where he thinks that his son starred in Jonah Hill.

48:20.100 --> 48:22.820
How does she convince me to come to this movie?

48:22.820 --> 48:23.780
This is terrible.

48:24.740 --> 48:26.740
Oh, get lonely, Nick.

48:26.740 --> 48:27.780
Really live in it.

48:27.780 --> 48:29.060
Just live in that loneliness.

48:29.060 --> 48:29.620
It'll get better.

48:29.620 --> 48:30.100
Wallow.

48:30.100 --> 48:32.100
Just have a lonely year.

48:32.100 --> 48:35.700
Have a lonely year, even though both of my brothers just said they managed the last three

48:35.700 --> 48:36.200
months.

48:37.780 --> 48:39.140
You gotta push yourself.

48:39.140 --> 48:40.980
Push yourself to the brink.

48:40.980 --> 48:43.300
Do as we do, not as we something.

48:43.300 --> 48:43.860
I don't know.

48:43.860 --> 48:45.220
Yeah, something along those lines.

48:46.420 --> 48:46.980
Griffin.

48:46.980 --> 48:47.940
I have a Yahoo for us.

48:47.940 --> 48:51.780
Who better?

48:51.780 --> 48:53.620
This one was sent in by Alex Siegler.

48:53.620 --> 48:55.140
It's by, oh, thank you, Alex.

48:55.140 --> 48:59.700
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Crest, who asks, is it okay for guys to skinny dip together?

49:01.300 --> 49:04.580
My friends and I are about to go swim, and we were curious if it was weird if we all

49:04.580 --> 49:05.460
went skinny dipping.

49:06.980 --> 49:09.460
It's from four weeks ago, so hopefully they found the answer by now.

49:09.460 --> 49:13.700
I'll tell you what's weirder is like having a discussion like, so you guys ready to skinny

49:13.700 --> 49:14.340
dip or what?

49:14.340 --> 49:17.700
And one person going, well, let's ask the internet first.

49:17.700 --> 49:18.200
Yeah.

49:19.060 --> 49:20.100
That's what's not okay.

49:22.420 --> 49:31.060
Okay, if you're a bunch of gay friends and you want to just go feast your eyes on some

49:31.060 --> 49:36.580
man candy and you're young, all fit, virile, I say go for it.

49:36.580 --> 49:37.060
Oh, fuck yeah.

49:37.060 --> 49:38.660
That sounds pretty great.

49:38.660 --> 49:39.700
That's not the question.

49:39.700 --> 49:40.900
Of course that's okay.

49:40.900 --> 49:42.580
What are you even doing on the internet?

49:42.580 --> 49:43.380
Just go for it.

49:43.380 --> 49:44.340
They're gonna leave.

49:44.340 --> 49:45.780
They're all piled into one car.

49:45.780 --> 49:48.100
And it smells amazing.

49:48.100 --> 49:51.540
Like, they're all going to the skinny dip.

49:51.540 --> 49:52.740
What is that smell?

49:52.740 --> 49:57.700
I don't think you pile into the car naked and arrive naked and get in the water naked

49:57.700 --> 50:00.100
and get out of the water naked and get back in the car naked and drive home naked.

50:00.100 --> 50:02.740
You guys want to go skinny driving?

50:02.740 --> 50:08.500
All the world's most tasteful colognes and just that smell melding into like one gay

50:08.500 --> 50:09.220
ambrosia.

50:09.220 --> 50:12.100
Like, yeah, I think you should probably get off Yahoo Answers and go-

50:12.660 --> 50:14.660
Can we say man-brosia?

50:14.660 --> 50:16.500
Man-brosia.

50:16.500 --> 50:24.740
But like, okay, I'm assuming by okay, this writer, this question asker, does not mean

50:24.740 --> 50:32.020
is it cool for me and all my other gay male friends to have a crazy bacchanal.

50:33.060 --> 50:36.500
This question is almost a little offensive because he's asking if it fits into sort of

50:36.500 --> 50:38.740
the heterosexual social norms.

50:38.740 --> 50:39.140
Is it okay-

50:39.140 --> 50:40.740
It doesn't fit into any social norms.

50:40.740 --> 50:45.060
Is it okay for a bunch of heterosexual friends to get naked and get in a lake together?

50:45.060 --> 50:48.420
And the answer is yes, yes, a thousand times yes.

50:48.420 --> 50:51.700
This is my question because I might be missing something here.

50:51.700 --> 50:55.780
I'm under the impression that skinny dipping serves two and only two purposes.

50:56.340 --> 51:00.180
One is nobody has a swimsuit, but we all want to swim.

51:00.180 --> 51:00.420
Yeah.

51:01.140 --> 51:01.860
Right?

51:01.860 --> 51:05.460
Second is we want it to lead to some sexy times.

51:06.020 --> 51:06.420
Is that it?

51:06.420 --> 51:10.260
I mean, this is the thing about- No, I think it has to do with perspective.

51:10.260 --> 51:15.620
I think if you're a woman, then you skinny dip because it's something wild.

51:15.620 --> 51:18.340
Like you're living this Natasha Bedingfield song.

51:18.340 --> 51:20.580
Like you are, you know what I mean?

51:20.580 --> 51:26.260
But for guys, when guys skinny dip, it is so they can see some juggums.

51:26.260 --> 51:26.980
That's right.

51:26.980 --> 51:30.340
Like that's just how guys, that's how the sexes are different.

51:30.340 --> 51:33.700
Like no guy gets in a pool naked with a bunch of his other friends.

51:33.700 --> 51:34.740
Like this is so wild.

51:34.740 --> 51:35.780
I can't believe we're doing this.

51:35.780 --> 51:38.100
Yeah, the balls are out and everything.

51:38.100 --> 51:47.300
And Justin, Travis, there is no freedom more free than just feeling cool, cool lake water

51:48.180 --> 51:51.380
right on your, whatchamacallit, like right on it.

51:51.380 --> 51:52.580
Like no mesh.

51:52.580 --> 51:58.180
I am willing to bet that out of these, what, 13 guys, like they said, hey, we're going to

51:58.180 --> 52:01.140
go swimming and like, well, let's say 12 of them were cool.

52:01.780 --> 52:04.740
And then the other one was like, I don't know that I want my Zagnuts out.

52:04.740 --> 52:04.980
Yeah.

52:04.980 --> 52:06.500
And when I show them off to everybody-

52:06.500 --> 52:08.420
Right on my, right on my mounds.

52:09.380 --> 52:10.660
Check the internet.

52:10.660 --> 52:10.980
Yeah.

52:10.980 --> 52:13.300
Hey, Swedish, does Yahoo have any answers?

52:14.340 --> 52:20.180
Yahoo, the best answer as chosen by voters, it's Yahoo answers user Harg who says,

52:20.820 --> 52:24.740
it would be weird if you have never been skinny dipping with mates at some point in your lifetime.

52:24.740 --> 52:26.500
It's pretty normal life experience.

52:26.500 --> 52:27.140
So there you go.

52:27.140 --> 52:28.020
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

52:28.020 --> 52:33.380
So he's saying if you are a novice at it, if you don't know how to do it right, it could be weird.

52:33.380 --> 52:34.340
I don't know.

52:34.340 --> 52:35.780
I don't think that's what he's saying at all.

52:35.780 --> 52:41.540
I think he's saying if you've never had interest in a nude moonlight swim with your bros with 15

52:41.540 --> 52:45.940
year closest bros, by the way, I don't think it's that many bros because once you get that many bros

52:45.940 --> 52:49.300
agreeing on something, it is like, it's a, it's a lifestyle.

52:49.300 --> 52:52.820
Once you get 15 bros all in a room, like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:52.820 --> 52:56.340
Now you're all living in some kind of weird cult compound thing.

52:56.340 --> 52:57.060
Let's do it.

52:57.060 --> 52:57.380
Yeah.

52:57.380 --> 52:58.020
Don't ever tell.

52:58.660 --> 52:58.820
Yeah.

52:58.820 --> 53:04.420
Then you, it's a decision that you've made and not like just three bros like, oh man,

53:04.420 --> 53:05.620
let's get in the water.

53:05.620 --> 53:06.260
You know what I mean?

53:06.260 --> 53:07.780
I think it's a harmless thing.

53:07.780 --> 53:13.220
I think that you got to, I think you got to get some moonlight and you've got to get some cool,

53:14.260 --> 53:18.900
cool lake water and maybe a duck will swim by and be like, hey duck, I'm naked.

53:20.980 --> 53:21.700
Don't ever tell.

53:21.700 --> 53:22.260
Don't ever tell.

53:22.260 --> 53:22.740
Don't ever tell.

53:22.740 --> 53:23.700
I'll get you, duck.

53:23.700 --> 53:28.020
Duck, I swear if you breathe a word of this, I will find you.

53:28.020 --> 53:29.300
Duck, don't you ever tell.

53:30.580 --> 53:33.300
Don't bite my, it's down there.

53:33.300 --> 53:34.100
Don't bite my thing.

53:34.100 --> 53:35.460
Don't bite my down there zone.

53:36.180 --> 53:39.940
We were on a nice kick for naming our dick after candy bars.

53:39.940 --> 53:40.660
Is there any other?

53:42.980 --> 53:45.300
Don't nibble on my fifth Avenue down there.

53:46.740 --> 53:48.580
Hey baby, are you ready to take five?

53:49.380 --> 53:50.980
Oh, your name is Henry.

53:50.980 --> 53:54.100
You might, I say just, oh, Henry.

53:54.100 --> 53:54.820
Oh my.

53:54.820 --> 53:55.380
Oh, Hank.

53:56.580 --> 53:57.940
Hey, I want to hear Griffin's.

53:57.940 --> 53:58.900
Toblerone.

53:58.900 --> 53:59.140
Yeah.

54:01.540 --> 54:02.820
This is my baby roof.

54:02.820 --> 54:04.580
It looks funky, but it feels fine.

54:05.700 --> 54:07.220
This is my chocolate boner.

54:09.220 --> 54:10.260
This is my Twix.

54:10.260 --> 54:11.060
I've got two of them.

54:11.700 --> 54:12.740
Don't tell, ducks.

54:14.260 --> 54:18.100
You actually get chocolate boners in the adults only section of Honeydukes.

54:18.100 --> 54:19.860
A lot of people don't know that.

54:19.860 --> 54:21.460
It's behind a magical curtain.

54:22.660 --> 54:23.700
We'll take the lot.

54:25.140 --> 54:26.820
Even the chocolate boners.

54:26.820 --> 54:28.740
I don't know if that's.

54:28.740 --> 54:33.220
Is it weird for me and my 12 friends to sit in a circle and eat chocolate boners

54:33.220 --> 54:34.260
or always stare at each other?

54:34.900 --> 54:35.380
That's fine.

54:35.940 --> 54:36.500
Don't worry about it.

54:36.500 --> 54:37.860
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

54:38.980 --> 54:41.220
First quick housekeeping things.

54:41.220 --> 54:42.740
This is my brother, my brother and me.

54:42.740 --> 54:47.220

55:12.820 --> 55:13.620
Thank you, Travis.

55:14.980 --> 55:15.860
That's not real.

55:15.860 --> 55:17.380
We also, you know, we want to do.

55:18.260 --> 55:21.460
I really, really, really want to do like a dating ad for somebody.

55:22.260 --> 55:22.900
So bad.

55:22.900 --> 55:23.860
So, so bad.

55:23.860 --> 55:28.180
Please, please, please get in touch with us so that we can do that on the Jumbotron.

55:28.180 --> 55:28.900
Please.

55:28.900 --> 55:29.620
I need to.

55:29.620 --> 55:30.980
And that's not a corporate thing.

55:30.980 --> 55:35.940
That's a, that's a personal message for $100 and you'll have a girlfriend.

55:37.060 --> 55:37.780
The love of your life.

55:38.340 --> 55:42.420
I really also want to thank John Roderick in the long winters for the use of their theme

55:42.420 --> 55:43.780
song for our show.

55:43.780 --> 55:48.500
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed, which I bought again today.

55:50.340 --> 55:55.460
Thank you so much for all of our Twitter friends that, that tweet about the show with the

55:55.460 --> 55:56.820
NB&BM hashtag.

55:56.820 --> 56:03.940
Thank you to Harley Grant, Little Froggy, Mary Beth, Jeff Bergkamp, everybody on the

56:03.940 --> 56:09.300
Parsipzilla, also Mariko, Joano11, everybody.

56:09.300 --> 56:10.020
Thank you so much.

56:10.020 --> 56:16.020
And a special thank you to Tracy V. Wilson, who Griffin and I met at PAX.

56:18.660 --> 56:23.700
And also there's been a lot of activity on the NB&BM wiki thing.

56:23.700 --> 56:29.540
And I want to appreciate, I want to say I appreciate everybody who's added stuff to

56:29.540 --> 56:31.060
that so new people can reference stuff.

56:31.060 --> 56:32.660
But I want to throw out real quick.

56:32.660 --> 56:38.740
My favorite sentence in the entire thing is I asked people to add some stuff to my profile

56:38.740 --> 56:43.140
and my favorite sentence is, for as long as he can remember, Travis has been played by

56:43.140 --> 56:43.860
Albert Brooks.

56:44.900 --> 56:46.980
And it makes me so incredibly happy.

56:47.620 --> 56:49.380
Thank you to Karen D for getting that going again.

56:49.380 --> 56:54.820
And if you want to hop on there and add to that, we would love that.

56:54.820 --> 56:58.740
How the fuck are we not on Wikipedia proper yet?

56:58.740 --> 57:02.500
Like our wiki is great and I love it, but why are we not on Wikipedia yet?

57:04.180 --> 57:06.820
Does anybody know the owner of Wikipedia?

57:06.820 --> 57:10.100
Yeah, we actually, we had a page once we got deleted.

57:10.100 --> 57:10.740
Did we really?

57:11.860 --> 57:12.580
Yeah.

57:12.580 --> 57:14.180
What a stern webmaster.

57:15.140 --> 57:18.100
Then we had a page on WikiLeaks and then it was like a huge thing.

57:19.860 --> 57:21.460
Yeah, leaked all of our documents.

57:21.460 --> 57:23.380
They revealed what the secret beeped word was.

57:26.660 --> 57:27.300
So thank you.

57:27.300 --> 57:27.940
Keep tweeting.

57:28.500 --> 57:31.220
When you tell people about the show, please include a link to our sampler.

57:31.220 --> 57:33.620
It's bit.ly forward slash it's bim bam.

57:33.620 --> 57:35.540
That's the best way to get people involved.

57:35.540 --> 57:38.340
Uh, Griffin, you know what I need.

57:38.340 --> 57:40.820
It's the final Yahoo answer sent in by Jacob blocker.

57:40.820 --> 57:41.460
Thank you, Jacob.

57:42.580 --> 57:45.140
It's by Yahoo answers user Tom's daughter.

57:46.580 --> 57:52.420
Who asks apart from the well-known book ghost cats, human encounters with

57:52.420 --> 57:54.340
feline spirits by dusty rainbow.

57:54.340 --> 57:57.460
What other evidence is there for the existence of an afterlife for cats?

58:00.900 --> 58:01.940
I'm Justin McElroy.

58:01.940 --> 58:02.820
I'm Travis McElroy.

58:02.820 --> 58:07.140
I'm dusty rainbow, my brother, my brother, me.

58:07.140 --> 58:07.780
He's your dad.

58:08.340 --> 58:09.300
Wear on the lips.

58:13.540 --> 58:14.420
Keep your heart.

58:14.420 --> 58:15.300
Three stacks.

58:15.300 --> 58:16.260
Keep your heart.

58:16.260 --> 58:17.540
Hey, keep your heart.

58:17.540 --> 58:18.420
Three stacks.

58:18.420 --> 58:19.460
Keep your heart.

58:19.460 --> 58:19.780
Man.

58:19.780 --> 58:20.740
These girls are smart.

58:20.740 --> 58:21.460
Three stacks.

58:21.460 --> 58:22.580
These girls are smart.

58:22.580 --> 58:32.980
Play your part, play your part.
