00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.360 --> 00:16.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:16.000 --> 00:30.880
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.880 --> 00:47.120
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me,

00:47.120 --> 00:50.720
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:50.720 --> 00:55.280
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:55.280 --> 00:59.040
We just forced our editor to cut out three minutes of us talking about

00:59.040 --> 01:03.200
Terra Cells before we could start the program. It's an epidemic, folks.

01:09.600 --> 01:14.080
Guys, we've got a brand new watch, and I can't stress enough how legitimate this watch is,

01:14.080 --> 01:20.160
and I'm very excited about it. Yesterday, news went out, DuckTales reboot cast, have you seen it?

01:20.880 --> 01:23.360
Griffin, are you losing your mind about this DuckTales cast?

01:23.360 --> 01:29.840
It's an insane DuckTales cast, but I have a problem with making this a watch, boys. I don't

01:29.840 --> 01:36.640
think the small screen can be a watch. I think a watch, if it was Passenger's Watch, if it was

01:36.640 --> 01:41.040
Star Wars, there's a new Star Wars, that's a big blockbuster watch.

01:41.600 --> 01:47.440
Bobby Moynihan, Danny Putty, Ben Schwartz, David Tennant, are you kidding me?

01:48.320 --> 01:52.800
I think it's PewDie because Danny Putty is the fun new holiday toy.

01:52.800 --> 01:54.880
You put it on the newspaper, and yeah, Danny Putty.

01:57.600 --> 02:03.280
It's hot as hell. Is it a watch, though? Another problem I have with it is it's not here yet.

02:03.280 --> 02:04.240
I can't watch it.

02:05.440 --> 02:09.680
How about we're watching the horizon? We're scoping. This is a scope.

02:09.680 --> 02:15.200
Then it's a scope. If we're doing a watch, then I'm sorry, but it has to be. Trolls is on DVD now,

02:16.240 --> 02:17.760
probably. It might be.

02:19.120 --> 02:21.600
Here's what I want to ask you guys. They put out the cast list, right?

02:21.600 --> 02:22.480
Yeah, okay.

02:22.480 --> 02:27.760
It's pretty, like, they revealed a lot here, but there's still some major characters that

02:27.760 --> 02:32.800
they haven't announced the casting for, and I want to throw it to us to make that decision for them.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.520
Here's the characters that I didn't see on that list.

02:35.520 --> 02:38.720
One, the big one jumped right out to me, Magic of Dispel.

02:38.720 --> 02:42.080
Always trying to get that number one dime so she can cast magic with it.

02:42.080 --> 02:44.720
Two, Gyrogear Loose.

02:44.720 --> 02:48.480
You're just going to, sorry, this isn't a segment where you want to make jokes about

02:48.480 --> 02:52.960
the actors and actresses that we think could fill these roles. You just want to sort of spout

02:52.960 --> 02:56.400
lore and show off how many DuckTales characters you know.

02:56.400 --> 02:59.680
Well, I mean, I do want to talk about, but yes, mostly I wanted to talk about. Also,

02:59.680 --> 03:02.000
I had this really great joke that you just stepped on where I was going to talk about

03:02.000 --> 03:06.400
Gyrogear Loose, or it might be Eurogear Loose, and I wasn't sure how it's pronounced.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.560
It was really good. I've been working on it for weeks.

03:08.560 --> 03:11.280
Oh, God, I'm sorry to step on that one.

03:11.280 --> 03:14.160
That's okay. You know, they'll fix it in post.

03:14.160 --> 03:19.600
Okay, so let's start with Magic of Dispel. Griffin, where are you at?

03:19.600 --> 03:28.880
I mean, Emily Blunt, I know she's busy, but not too busy for DuckTales. If David Tennant

03:28.880 --> 03:33.360
is in the mix, then if Beck Bennett, is Beck Bennett still on SNL?

03:33.360 --> 03:34.880
Uh, yeah.

03:34.880 --> 03:37.760
He's busy too. Get in there.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.440
Ooh, Kate McKinnon.

03:39.440 --> 03:44.960
Okay, yeah, I mean, any SNL, let's just make it an all SNL cast.

03:44.960 --> 03:52.400
Yeah, can I hit you guys with a sick Magic of Dispel, and it's Ms. Jessica Walter.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.480
Oh, shit.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.080
Yeah, from downtown.

03:56.080 --> 03:56.560
Okay.

03:56.560 --> 03:57.760
Shit, that's good, Justin.

03:57.760 --> 03:58.400
It's really good.

03:59.280 --> 04:05.520
Is this gonna, are we gonna get a revival of hot cartoons from my kid age? Are we gonna

04:05.520 --> 04:10.320
get, are we gonna get a tailspin starring Denzel Washington as Baloo?

04:11.680 --> 04:13.120
That would be amazing.

04:13.120 --> 04:17.360
Reprising his character from flight with just replacing Baloo.

04:17.360 --> 04:21.600
Uh-huh. He flies the plane upside down drunk, I think. I didn't see it. I saw the trailer,

04:21.600 --> 04:22.960
and I think he was drunk.

04:22.960 --> 04:26.080
Just screaming, wahoo! I see that. It was amazing.

04:27.120 --> 04:31.920
Here's my question. Here's my question. Here's my question. It's 2016. It will be 2017.

04:31.920 --> 04:33.040
Donald. Donald. That's what you're wondering.

04:33.040 --> 04:38.160
Well, Donald's a big one, but 2017, right, is when this is coming out. It's hitting shores,

04:38.160 --> 04:38.960
2017.

04:39.680 --> 04:43.680
What takes, what's taking him so long? You're just drawing funny pictures.

04:43.680 --> 04:48.880
Well, one, that. But two, what kind of dark, gritty elements do you think they're gonna

04:48.880 --> 04:52.320
put in now that weren't there in our childhood?

04:52.320 --> 04:52.800
Guns.

04:53.600 --> 04:54.320
Okay.

04:54.320 --> 05:00.560
His cane has got a poison tip. It is fatal. That's a new thing.

05:00.560 --> 05:05.200
Oh, I wonder if there'll be whole storylines about income inequality in Duckburg.

05:06.000 --> 05:06.800
Interesting.

05:06.800 --> 05:13.200
We'll raise some troubling, it's a troubling visual. Once you realize he's absolutely one of

05:13.200 --> 05:15.680
the 0.01 percenters.

05:16.960 --> 05:21.920
He probably, the series probably opens with him getting picked for a cabinet position.

05:21.920 --> 05:31.280
And I think the first episode, we have to watch Launchpad McQuacks, or nope, sorry,

05:31.280 --> 05:38.480
Robo-Duck's grizzly surgery that turns him, that replaces all of his fleshy duck parts

05:39.040 --> 05:45.200
with cybernetic stuff. So like the lung, the lungs are gone. The duck lungs are gone.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.840
That weird spiral pee pee, that's gone.

05:47.840 --> 05:50.400
He's gotta carry them all in a backpack now.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.480
It's all his organs they took out.

05:52.480 --> 05:56.800
I would like to pitch, if you're listening to this Disney XD, and I know he's super

05:56.800 --> 06:01.440
busy, listen, you can't find a busier man in show business right now, but Fit and

06:01.440 --> 06:07.040
Crack Show, AKA Gizmo Duck, is Lin-Manuel Miranda. Like that would be amazing casting.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.000
That'd be really good.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.120
Please make that happen.

06:09.120 --> 06:14.320
And he could really sell the duck screams as, cause he's awake during the robo-surgery.

06:15.520 --> 06:18.960
And I don't know why they make us look at this and I don't know why, it's a children's cartoon.

06:18.960 --> 06:26.240
Uh, if I could just put it in my hat here for Donald, cause I feel like, um, my Donald

06:26.240 --> 06:33.200
is so nightmare-inducing as I've tried to like replicate it for our child. It's so bad

06:33.200 --> 06:39.600
that, uh, my wife makes me do it on command just to make fun of me because she's that

06:39.600 --> 06:40.480
much in dis-

06:40.480 --> 06:43.040
Hey, break, break me off a, break me off a piece of that football cream.

06:43.040 --> 06:47.520
You guys gave me like a line from DuckTales 2017 that he-

06:47.520 --> 06:50.880
Oh my God, my God. There's duck guts everywhere.

06:50.880 --> 06:51.120
Yeah.

06:57.120 --> 07:03.840
You sound like, it sounds like a, an interstellar transmission from the cataracts, which is

07:03.840 --> 07:07.840
an alien species that's just sort of, uh, based around violence.

07:10.640 --> 07:15.600
You might also be some kind of like the fly hybrid between Donald Duck and the fish from

07:15.600 --> 07:17.120
Pee-Wee's Playhouse.

07:17.120 --> 07:17.840
Yeah.

07:17.840 --> 07:21.520
Do you think when you're trying to get your Donald, you have to sound like that for like

07:21.520 --> 07:27.040
a hundred hours and then it just like gels, like it just comes to you? Do you think that's

07:27.040 --> 07:27.360
how it works?

07:27.360 --> 07:27.680
I don't know, bud.

07:27.680 --> 07:31.280
No, I think you're born with it. I think either you've got it or you don't.

07:31.840 --> 07:38.080
Yeah. Uh, and you, you do, you do. Congratulations, Justin. You, baby, you got it. You got that

07:38.080 --> 07:39.040
sound I've been looking for.

07:39.040 --> 07:45.120
Would you guys be interested in a new podcast called Let Me Hear Your Donald? And it's just,

07:45.120 --> 07:49.760
you talk to new parents or parents who've been in the game for a while, any parents,

07:49.760 --> 07:54.320
and just like, let me hear your Donald real quick. Let me hear the Donald you're working

07:54.320 --> 07:54.560
with.

07:54.560 --> 07:58.720
I mean, if the last year has taught me anything, it's that just we can do basically anything

07:58.720 --> 08:00.560
up here and people will listen to it.

08:00.560 --> 08:00.800
So.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.160
Yeah. Yeah, do true.

08:02.160 --> 08:03.440
Do you want to hear mine?

08:03.440 --> 08:05.040
Yeah, let's hear your Donald.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.640
Hello, I am Donald Duck.

08:06.640 --> 08:07.760
No, that's not anything.

08:07.760 --> 08:11.760
Now I know, I know what you're thinking. That's not it. But here's what I'm planning.

08:11.760 --> 08:18.640
I'm going to read books about Donald Duck to my child long before she ever sees him

08:18.640 --> 08:20.240
in any kind of moving picture.

08:20.240 --> 08:23.200
And so then when she hears that, that person's doing it wrong.

08:23.200 --> 08:27.440
That's how Donald. So no, no old Disney cartoons, no Kingdom Hearts.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.120
Not till she's like five or six. You know what I mean?

08:31.120 --> 08:37.760
I put myself out there actually. Real quick, can I just hear, I'm going to leave you boys

08:37.760 --> 08:44.960
with Uncle Scrooge in your best Donald and not a joke, but like right now, cold.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.520
Give it your best to try to make that classic.

08:47.520 --> 08:50.400
I've got I've got my expense.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.600
Sure. That'll make it perfect.

08:51.600 --> 08:52.400
Even better.

08:52.400 --> 08:55.440
What a nice timber that will lend to your performance.

08:55.440 --> 08:58.640
OK, I'm going to do my best.

08:58.640 --> 08:59.120
Yeah, OK.

09:00.960 --> 09:03.280
Justin, did you do yours one more time as a reference for me?

09:04.320 --> 09:07.040
This is what Donald is supposed to sound like.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.600
No, no, you do yours right now.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.120
Cold, I'm not stalling for you anymore.

09:11.120 --> 09:12.720
Make the sound of Donald with your mouth.

09:14.160 --> 09:14.720
I can't.

09:14.720 --> 09:15.520
I got nothing.

09:15.520 --> 09:17.600
I'm going to leave you boys with Uncle Scrooge.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.680
No, I think I'm just doing Bobcat Gold

09:21.680 --> 09:24.480
Yeah, Travis, I need you to do it for real and not don't laugh through it.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.280
This is serious.

09:26.560 --> 09:27.520
Don't fuck with Travis.

09:27.520 --> 09:28.080
Stop laughing.

09:28.080 --> 09:29.600
This is a serious moment.

09:29.600 --> 09:32.000
It doesn't help that Travis is looking at me in horror.

09:32.000 --> 09:58.960
I'm going to leave you boys with Uncle Scrooge.

10:02.960 --> 10:30.960
No, I think I'm just doing Bobcat Gold.

10:30.960 --> 10:59.920
No, I think I'm just doing Bobcat Gold.

10:59.920 --> 11:28.880
