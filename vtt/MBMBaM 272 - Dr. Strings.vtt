WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.640
Hey everybody, welcome to my brother, my brother, me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:48.640 --> 00:52.400
My name is Justin McElroy, and I'm your oldest brother of the show.

00:52.960 --> 00:56.640
My name is Travis McElroy, and I'm your middle-est brother of the show.

00:56.640 --> 01:00.720
And I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Boys, it's good to have you here.

01:00.720 --> 01:04.960
I'm excited to have the opportunity to speak to the both of you today.

01:06.320 --> 01:08.640
Thank you, Griffin. I'm glad we could be here for you.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.800
I forgot how we do it.

01:12.800 --> 01:18.240
This ain't how we do it, this isn't how we do it.

01:18.240 --> 01:22.240
Justin, I have great news for you though, and that is that we don't have to stay

01:22.240 --> 01:27.760
in the podcast game anymore because I've discovered a new exciting career opportunity

01:27.760 --> 01:30.160
that I think the three of us can spearhead together.

01:30.160 --> 01:37.120
I've been working on it for the past 48 hours, and I'm already a multi-dollar heir.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.960
And I think that I can grab the two of you and I can bring you up with me,

01:40.960 --> 01:42.080
up the success ladder.

01:42.080 --> 01:44.480
Is it gambling? Because I've been doing that already.

01:45.040 --> 01:47.360
No, God, you're not on that fucking fan duel, are you?

01:47.360 --> 01:48.800
We can talk about it later.

01:48.800 --> 01:52.240
Yeah, we can. Yeah, we're gonna talk about that shit later, Travis.

01:52.240 --> 01:55.680
No, it's not gambling because gambling assumes a risk of failure.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.120
This is a 100% guarantee.

01:57.120 --> 02:00.640
It's a proven system, scientifically proven system.

02:00.640 --> 02:05.440
Boys, I'd like to talk to the two of you about joining me in becoming a beauty-tainer.

02:06.160 --> 02:07.120
Excuse me?

02:07.120 --> 02:08.320
Now, what's a beauty-tainer?

02:08.880 --> 02:16.400
A beauty-tainer is, of course, a secondhand retailer of the cosmetic line

02:16.400 --> 02:18.880
belonging to one Miss Tyra Banks.

02:20.160 --> 02:24.640
She has a new cosmetic line, and it's called Tyra, and she's looking for...

02:25.360 --> 02:29.200
And guys, the hard part is gonna be getting on board,

02:29.200 --> 02:31.840
because the audition process is rigorous.

02:32.480 --> 02:37.440
But if you can get on board, you can join me in selling these Tyra beauty products

02:37.440 --> 02:38.880
to your friends, to your colleagues.

02:39.440 --> 02:43.360
You can have tie-tie parties at your house, and you will.

02:43.360 --> 02:47.200
I already have tie-tie parties, so it's really encouraging for me

02:47.200 --> 02:49.040
that I'm gonna be able to sell merch.

02:49.040 --> 02:51.600
Uh-huh, you're gonna get something out of these tie-tie parties

02:51.600 --> 02:53.360
because they're expensive to put on, aren't they?

02:53.360 --> 02:58.160
Getting salon people in there to give people that tie-tie chop,

02:58.160 --> 03:00.560
and bartenders to make my tie-ties.

03:00.560 --> 03:01.840
Listen, it's gonna be...

03:02.960 --> 03:04.720
I almost said risky, but it's not risky.

03:04.720 --> 03:05.440
It's guaranteed.

03:05.440 --> 03:08.720
I've made $16 in the past 48 hours.

03:08.720 --> 03:09.920
Wow, just like that?

03:09.920 --> 03:11.120
Do you know what that translates to?

03:11.120 --> 03:12.400
Do you know what that translates to?

03:12.400 --> 03:12.960
No.

03:12.960 --> 03:13.840
It's pennies.

03:13.840 --> 03:14.880
Pennies on the hour.

03:14.880 --> 03:16.560
Pennies on the hour, guys.

03:17.440 --> 03:19.520
But do you know how many hours you have in a week?

03:19.520 --> 03:21.280
525,600.

03:21.280 --> 03:22.160
Girl, let me ask you this.

03:22.720 --> 03:24.080
So you're already a beauty tainer,

03:24.080 --> 03:25.840
so you should be able to answer this question.

03:25.840 --> 03:26.480
What is it?

03:26.480 --> 03:31.760
What sets this product apart from all the rest?

03:31.760 --> 03:35.680
It's gonna make your whole gut pop.

03:36.240 --> 03:39.840
Whoa, are popping guts back?

03:40.400 --> 03:40.960
Yeah.

03:40.960 --> 03:43.280
Your gut, it's gonna pop.

03:43.280 --> 03:44.720
And your face is gonna...

03:47.760 --> 03:48.480
And that's good.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.240
Yeah, that's like a new word.

03:50.960 --> 03:52.080
So that's a word that Tyra...

03:52.080 --> 03:54.400
Every week, Tyra sends you a letter in the mail,

03:54.400 --> 03:56.720
and it just has like a new Tyra-ism in it.

03:56.720 --> 03:58.480
And this week, it's like, make that face...

03:59.920 --> 04:01.200
Now, can you give me a spelling?

04:01.200 --> 04:02.400
Just a quick spell check on that,

04:02.400 --> 04:04.320
so I can add it to my dictionary?

04:04.320 --> 04:04.720
Yeah.

04:04.720 --> 04:05.680
My auto correct.

04:06.240 --> 04:07.680
S-W-E-W-P.

04:07.680 --> 04:09.680
S-W-E-W-P.

04:09.680 --> 04:10.960
It's pretty much phonetically...

04:10.960 --> 04:13.280
So it's pronounced S-W-E-W-P.

04:13.280 --> 04:14.160
Yeah, you got it.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.400
Just for yourself, like a regular beauty tainer yourself.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.520
Is there any upfront cost to getting on board?

04:19.520 --> 04:20.720
That's exactly what I was gonna ask.

04:20.720 --> 04:21.600
Thank you, Travis.

04:21.600 --> 04:22.480
$35,000.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.560
$35,000 at very reasonable.

04:24.560 --> 04:26.080
One time fee, one time fee though.

04:26.080 --> 04:29.840
And it's like, you know, the title doesn't go away.

04:29.840 --> 04:32.400
Once you become a grand master chess player,

04:32.400 --> 04:33.600
you're always a grand master for life.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.240
It's a one time only fee per year, right?

04:36.240 --> 04:36.720
Yeah, yeah.

04:36.720 --> 04:37.760
That's what I meant, one time.

04:37.760 --> 04:38.480
Per annum.

04:38.480 --> 04:41.520
Yeah, you only have to pay it once every calendar year.

04:42.480 --> 04:44.320
And if you don't pay it, they actually do come to your house

04:44.320 --> 04:46.480
and they take away all your beauty tainer credentials.

04:46.480 --> 04:49.440
But I feel really, I feel good about myself

04:49.440 --> 04:51.360
for the first time in a long time.

04:51.360 --> 04:53.520
And that might just be because I am completely

04:54.080 --> 04:56.480
just fucking covered in the stuff.

04:56.480 --> 04:59.200
Oh, so you're using, you're high on your own supply.

04:59.760 --> 05:03.520
Yeah, well, I've got $35,000 fucking dollars worth

05:03.520 --> 05:10.640
of creams and salves and there's a sparkle element to it.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.520
And I look fucking incredible.

05:14.720 --> 05:16.400
I feel like a million dollars,

05:16.400 --> 05:20.640
but I feel like actually I probably have about $600 worth

05:21.280 --> 05:23.600
of creams and salves on me at this exact moment.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.280
Anyway, I want to talk to the two of you.

05:25.280 --> 05:26.640
Maybe we can do it after the podcast

05:26.640 --> 05:28.480
because I sense your hesitance.

05:28.480 --> 05:32.960
But I want to turn that hesitance into fucking glamour.

05:32.960 --> 05:35.360
President has a sense.

05:35.360 --> 05:36.320
Prestidigitation.

05:36.320 --> 05:38.000
Like presidents like the Bills.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.800
I want the two of you to become the presidents of America.

05:40.800 --> 05:41.040
Okay.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.880
I don't think that Tyra can help with that.

05:42.880 --> 05:43.680
No, I think she can.

05:43.680 --> 05:44.400
I think this is the first step.

05:44.400 --> 05:45.440
She has a lot of power.

05:45.440 --> 05:48.080
Tyra Banks is an inspiration.

05:48.080 --> 05:51.520
My daughter will say in the speech to her civics class

05:51.520 --> 05:53.600
in 10th grade, Tyra Banks is an inspiration.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.600
She was our nation's first fabulous president.

05:55.600 --> 05:56.240
That is true.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.960
She was our sixth female president.

05:58.960 --> 05:59.600
Six female.

05:59.600 --> 06:03.920
But she was the first one that was like really fucking rocking it.

06:03.920 --> 06:07.360
Did anybody watch Friday's episode of ANTM 2.2?

06:07.360 --> 06:08.800
I'm a little behind.

06:08.800 --> 06:09.600
You're a little behind.

06:09.600 --> 06:10.000
Okay.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.800
Well, she does a whole music video promoting her line of products

06:12.800 --> 06:14.080
and there's the chorus of it.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.440
Can I perform it for you now?

06:15.440 --> 06:17.600
Because we have to perform it every time you hold a party.

06:17.600 --> 06:18.560
Please do.

06:18.560 --> 06:21.760
And by party, I mean enclave.

06:22.720 --> 06:23.920
That's what she says to call them.

06:23.920 --> 06:25.120
Anyway, the song goes,

06:25.120 --> 06:27.280
Work the hallway like a runway.

06:27.280 --> 06:29.200
Work that hallway like a runway.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.240
Excuse me, Ms. Banks.

06:30.960 --> 06:31.840
Excuse me, Ms. Banks.

06:31.840 --> 06:33.920
What do you mean by work that?

06:33.920 --> 06:36.160
What do you mean by work that hallway like a runway?

06:36.160 --> 06:39.200
I, Griffin, I guarantee, let me take you behind the curtain

06:39.200 --> 06:41.440
to where they were writing this hit single.

06:41.440 --> 06:42.000
Yes, please.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.720
I want to reference a runway,

06:44.720 --> 06:48.320
but Ms. Banks, like not everybody has access to a runway.

06:48.320 --> 06:49.920
Well, can anybody find a hallway?

06:49.920 --> 06:50.320
Yes.

06:50.320 --> 06:50.560
Okay.

06:50.560 --> 06:52.720
So we'll just make it like a hallway is like a runway.

06:53.360 --> 06:53.680
What do you mean?

06:53.680 --> 06:55.440
Except it's not because it's like enclosed

06:55.440 --> 06:57.520
and there's nowhere for people to sit and snap pictures.

06:57.520 --> 07:00.880
And that's why you have to make the hallway like a runway.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.320
Come on, Steven.

07:02.320 --> 07:03.840
If you're at a dinner party

07:03.840 --> 07:05.680
and you're waiting on the bathroom

07:05.680 --> 07:08.880
and then just coming down the hall from the bathroom,

07:08.880 --> 07:11.360
you saw the host of the party just working it,

07:11.360 --> 07:13.040
you would think that's insane.

07:13.040 --> 07:13.280
Yep.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.560
Or if you saw like a 16 year old kid

07:16.560 --> 07:18.080
walking down a hallway at school,

07:18.080 --> 07:19.920
just like working it like they were on a runway,

07:20.480 --> 07:22.240
they're going to be shunned.

07:22.240 --> 07:25.280
I just wanted to like warm you guys up to the fact

07:25.280 --> 07:26.480
that whenever we're together

07:26.480 --> 07:30.880
and you see me moving between a narrow chamber between rooms

07:30.880 --> 07:34.080
and I'm just fucking on my grind.

07:35.120 --> 07:37.600
Griffin won't even acknowledge always anymore.

07:37.600 --> 07:40.880
He just calls them shitty runways.

07:40.880 --> 07:41.360
Yeah.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.520
Enclosed runway cages.

07:44.400 --> 07:47.120
One of my best friends is an incredibly cheerful

07:47.120 --> 07:48.320
and positive person.

07:49.040 --> 07:51.120
Like relentlessly so.

07:51.840 --> 07:54.480
I am fairly eh with my outlook on life

07:54.480 --> 07:55.760
and appreciate her disposition.

07:55.760 --> 07:58.160
Although at times it can be very overwhelming.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.920
How can I tell her to tone down the sunny side

07:59.920 --> 08:01.680
without sounding like a total monster?

08:01.680 --> 08:03.040
Overcast in Omaha.

08:03.040 --> 08:03.600
Bad news.

08:03.600 --> 08:04.320
It's too late.

08:05.520 --> 08:07.520
It's like you already sound like a total monster.

08:07.520 --> 08:07.760
Yeah.

08:08.640 --> 08:10.480
His friend, you've come to the wrong place.

08:12.160 --> 08:14.000
I think the reason you have a problem

08:14.000 --> 08:15.360
figuring out how to say it

08:15.920 --> 08:18.800
is because like there is no reason to say,

08:18.800 --> 08:20.080
like play that out.

08:20.080 --> 08:23.120
Like, hey, hey, Debbie, don't be so happy.

08:23.120 --> 08:25.920
Yeah, like it doesn't make sense.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.200
I mean, think about it.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.600
How does it negatively affect you at all?

08:30.880 --> 08:34.480
How cool is your life that you're not just like

08:34.480 --> 08:36.960
feeding off of people like that relentlessly?

08:36.960 --> 08:38.000
You gotta feed off.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.360
Do you not realize that that's,

08:39.360 --> 08:41.440
maybe you don't realize that that's the secret

08:41.440 --> 08:43.280
is you have to be a joy leech

08:43.280 --> 08:48.160
by hanging off of the fatty flesh of your happy friends.

08:48.160 --> 08:51.760
You are not harvesting enough.

08:51.760 --> 08:52.880
That's the problem.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.400
The problem is with you.

08:54.400 --> 08:58.080
You are supposed to come at like the little bird

08:58.080 --> 09:00.480
and peck the joy from between her teeth.

09:00.480 --> 09:01.440
Like the rhino.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.360
And that's good for both of you

09:03.360 --> 09:06.240
because then she gets her teeth cleaned

09:06.240 --> 09:08.720
and you get a little bit of happiness chunks.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.720
Do you know that song Rainbow Connection?

09:10.720 --> 09:16.080
That song is literally about like a virulent proboscis

09:16.080 --> 09:18.320
that you just jam into your happy friends

09:18.320 --> 09:20.080
and you sustain yourself.

09:20.080 --> 09:23.680
Yeah, you are the pilot fish to her shark of joy.

09:23.680 --> 09:26.240
You need to just clean that joy off.

09:26.240 --> 09:27.280
If she has to do her abundance

09:27.280 --> 09:30.880
it's because you're not filling your quota

09:30.880 --> 09:32.880
of just draining it.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.640
But listen, don't change too much

09:34.640 --> 09:36.960
because she's also feeding off your sorrow

09:36.960 --> 09:38.160
and that's important.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.640
If it wasn't for that, she just wouldn't,

09:40.640 --> 09:42.800
she would just be dancing in the street.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.240
I think we've basically just described

09:44.240 --> 09:46.000
the plot of Inside Out, right?

09:46.000 --> 09:49.760
Like that's the happiness and sadness go together.

09:49.760 --> 09:51.280
And we've also described like the truth

09:51.280 --> 09:52.400
about cats and dogs.

09:52.400 --> 09:53.280
There's a lot.

09:53.280 --> 09:54.480
Must love dogs.

09:54.480 --> 09:56.400
Must all dogs go to heaven.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.160
Air Bud one through six.

09:58.880 --> 10:02.560
I just don't see why it's important to you to like-

10:02.560 --> 10:03.200
Unless.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.480
Like you understand.

10:04.480 --> 10:09.760
Unless she's cheerful at like the exact wrong times.

10:09.760 --> 10:10.560
Oh boy.

10:10.560 --> 10:14.240
Like a friend like has just like had their car totaled

10:14.240 --> 10:16.000
or like a loved one passed away

10:16.000 --> 10:18.960
and she's like, awesome, great, totally cool you guys.

10:18.960 --> 10:21.200
You didn't say she's unbalanced.

10:21.200 --> 10:23.680
But they said at times overwhelming.

10:23.680 --> 10:26.800
Yeah, they just watched the harrowing documentary

10:26.800 --> 10:28.400
Dear Zachary and then it's-

10:30.160 --> 10:32.080
Good one TV program.

10:32.080 --> 10:32.880
Classic.

10:32.880 --> 10:33.360
Classic.

10:33.360 --> 10:37.120
I could also see though in like if everybody's like,

10:37.120 --> 10:38.320
oh, do you wanna order a pizza?

10:38.320 --> 10:40.880
And she just is like, it's the greatest thing

10:40.880 --> 10:44.960
where I could see it coming across as very insincere

10:44.960 --> 10:48.480
if she's overly cheerful and excited about everything.

10:48.480 --> 10:49.120
But that's on you.

10:49.120 --> 10:51.600
If a person's being sincere and you think they're being insincere

10:51.600 --> 10:53.040
that is not a them problem.

10:53.040 --> 10:54.000
That is a you problem.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.520
But is that a conversation you'd have?

10:55.520 --> 10:57.120
Or like if you're that excited about everything

10:57.120 --> 10:58.560
then you're that excited about nothing?

10:58.560 --> 10:59.920
Like you have to vary it up into-

10:59.920 --> 11:00.560
Absolutely not.

11:01.120 --> 11:02.880
Why not be senselessly joyful?

11:02.880 --> 11:04.560
Why not just be completely happy about-

11:05.360 --> 11:08.560
We all used to be fucking stoked about pizza.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.360
We all used to get that stoked about pizza

11:11.360 --> 11:12.880
and she has somehow preserved that

11:12.880 --> 11:16.000
and for you to come around and try to snatch that from her hand

11:16.000 --> 11:17.120
is a sin.

11:17.120 --> 11:18.480
It's sinful.

11:18.480 --> 11:20.160
If you say someone's over-

11:20.160 --> 11:22.240
Like my friend is really happy

11:22.240 --> 11:23.920
and sometimes it can be overwhelming.

11:23.920 --> 11:26.160
You sound like Lydia from Beetlejuice.

11:29.920 --> 11:32.000
You have to just lighten up a little bit.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.080
I agree.

11:34.080 --> 11:34.960
I agree too.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.000
How about a Yahoo?

11:36.000 --> 11:36.640
Wait, is that-

11:36.640 --> 11:38.320
Well, I don't wanna be-

11:38.960 --> 11:40.080
Oh man, I don't know.

11:40.080 --> 11:43.760
I don't wanna be like callous or hurt somebody's feelings.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.440
No, you are the way you are.

11:45.440 --> 11:48.080
It's just like I understand that this is not a-

11:49.040 --> 11:50.640
Okay, let me put it to you this way.

11:50.640 --> 11:52.720
If this is genuinely a problem for you,

11:52.720 --> 11:55.680
the onus is on you to distance yourself from this person,

11:55.680 --> 11:57.680
not to try to fucking bring them down.

11:57.680 --> 12:00.240
Or to hang out with them at appropriately cheerful times.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.680
When you're in a good groove,

12:01.680 --> 12:04.160
you got that radiation vibe you're grooving on,

12:04.160 --> 12:05.520
you're gonna call her up,

12:05.520 --> 12:06.720
get out there in the sun,

12:06.720 --> 12:08.960
get some mochas and just have a day.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.560
And if you find yourself in a situation

12:10.560 --> 12:12.560
where she's like super cheerful about something,

12:12.560 --> 12:14.560
try to see it how she sees it

12:14.560 --> 12:15.440
and maybe you're like, you know what?

12:15.440 --> 12:17.200
There is a lot of good in this situation.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.080
People like this are fucking magic.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.440
They're real life magic.

12:23.440 --> 12:24.640
And you've got to surround yourself

12:24.640 --> 12:27.040
with as many of them as you possibly can.

12:27.040 --> 12:30.960
Build yourself a flesh barrier with these happy SOBs.

12:30.960 --> 12:31.600
You need it.

12:32.160 --> 12:32.880
We all need it.

12:32.880 --> 12:33.760
How about a Yahoo?

12:33.760 --> 12:34.480
Yeah.

12:34.480 --> 12:38.080
This Yahoo was sent in by game recognized game,

12:38.080 --> 12:38.800
Rachel Sperling.

12:38.800 --> 12:39.440
Thank you, Rachel.

12:39.440 --> 12:40.720
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

12:40.720 --> 12:41.760
Oh, they're anonymous.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.640
And for good reason, based on this question,

12:44.640 --> 12:46.640
it was posted in education and reference,

12:46.640 --> 12:48.480
higher education, university plus.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.480
Have you guys started university plus yet?

12:52.480 --> 12:55.120
Oh no, I wasn't willing to pay the subscription fee.

12:55.120 --> 12:56.320
Yeah, you gotta pay a subscription fee,

12:56.320 --> 12:57.920
but they let you keep your level and the items.

12:57.920 --> 12:59.520
I haven't found all the collectibles in university.

12:59.520 --> 13:01.360
From the original university.

13:01.360 --> 13:05.600
Anyway, this anonymous answer, Yahoo asker,

13:05.600 --> 13:08.560
let's call him BJ asks.

13:09.440 --> 13:09.840
Nice.

13:09.840 --> 13:11.120
Nice, come on.

13:13.280 --> 13:17.360
BJ asks, do colleges look at Yahoo Answers?

13:19.360 --> 13:23.600
And if they did, I have asked some very personal questions,

13:23.600 --> 13:25.760
such as when I did vape.

13:27.120 --> 13:28.800
Now, I just, there's a lot.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.720
His test scores are out of this world.

13:30.720 --> 13:32.400
Lots of really great extracurricular.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.200
What's this?

13:33.200 --> 13:33.840
Wait a minute.

13:33.840 --> 13:34.960
When did vape?

13:34.960 --> 13:35.840
When he did vape.

13:35.840 --> 13:40.240
Wait, he's also spelled vape with an at sign instead of an a.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.920
Is vape like banned on Yahoo?

13:41.920 --> 13:43.360
Yeah, so that way it can't be.

13:43.360 --> 13:45.120
It's actually pronounced va-ta-pe.

13:46.480 --> 13:48.560
Hand me that va-ta-pe cigarette.

13:49.920 --> 13:54.560
If you can be tracked from your human identity

13:54.560 --> 13:56.800
back to your Yahoo Answers identity,

13:56.800 --> 14:00.560
you have fucked up worse than anybody could fuck up ever.

14:00.560 --> 14:03.200
All right, let me finish reading the additional details.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.480
Personal questions, such as when I did va-ta-pe,

14:06.480 --> 14:09.280
or when I was younger, I asked how to master,

14:09.280 --> 14:12.240
I don't have to finish that word, master.

14:12.240 --> 14:13.200
Pokemon.

14:13.200 --> 14:16.080
Pokemon bait, master Pokemon bait.

14:18.800 --> 14:20.480
I don't have to finish that word, lol.

14:21.440 --> 14:24.320
Well, I have asked some questions like that and such.

14:24.320 --> 14:25.840
Do colleges look at Yahoo Answers?

14:25.840 --> 14:28.240
And if they did, would they not accept me when I'm older,

14:28.240 --> 14:31.040
slash not like me, slash not approve me?

14:31.040 --> 14:34.480
I mean, if they did, they were just questions.

14:34.480 --> 14:37.360
Questions are the keys to your mind's development.

14:37.360 --> 14:40.080
One, whoever has to do that at a college

14:40.080 --> 14:41.840
has the worst job in the world.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.880
Two, I want the answer to be not like you,

14:44.880 --> 14:47.200
but still accept you from the college.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.880
Like, yes, you can come here.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.840
Oh, God, look at you.

14:51.840 --> 14:53.760
This person you've just described, Travis,

14:53.760 --> 14:55.600
who asked the Yahoo Diver,

14:56.720 --> 14:59.840
like I'm imagining somebody just wearing fucking riot gear,

14:59.840 --> 15:02.800
just connected to a fucking like oxygen tank.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.200
I guess it's the logical conclusion

15:05.200 --> 15:08.960
of if like Drew and Rachel and Zoe Kinski went pro.

15:09.680 --> 15:12.160
Yeah, yeah, oh, God, they went fucking white hat.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.200
They're on the right side of the law now,

15:15.840 --> 15:18.960
surfing the deep web for dumb questions.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.120
This is my brother, my brother and me civil war.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.360
This is the sort of thing that like somebody would invent

15:25.360 --> 15:28.880
like an AI program to do data mining into Yahoo Answers

15:28.880 --> 15:30.640
to see if college applicants had ever asked

15:30.640 --> 15:32.960
how to masturbate or how to Vitape.

15:34.080 --> 15:35.840
And then that program that you create

15:35.840 --> 15:38.080
to do that data mining would definitely become sentient

15:38.080 --> 15:39.520
and definitely kill humanity

15:39.520 --> 15:41.680
because it's seen the darkest, darkest side of us.

15:42.480 --> 15:43.600
It's lived through the darkest universe.

15:43.600 --> 15:46.720
I will answer the greatest Yahoo Answers question,

15:46.720 --> 15:49.600
how to protect humanity from itself.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.440
Yeah, by annihilating it.

15:51.440 --> 15:53.600
I think that was Robot Kennedy I just did.

15:53.600 --> 15:54.880
I think it definitely was.

15:54.880 --> 15:55.440
I loved it.

15:55.440 --> 16:01.440
Ask not what you can error, logical fallacy.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.320
I cannot imagine why,

16:12.640 --> 16:14.960
can you even imagine being the person,

16:14.960 --> 16:16.080
not just the person who has to read them,

16:16.080 --> 16:18.640
but the person who has to connect the identities?

16:18.640 --> 16:20.480
Like how would you even?

16:20.480 --> 16:23.200
Oh, sorry, this guy, I'm actually his Yahoo name loaded,

16:23.200 --> 16:27.120
it's actually Steve Jefferson, Huntington High School,

16:27.120 --> 16:29.360
class of 2016.

16:29.360 --> 16:30.080
Okay.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.200
So that's his username.

16:31.200 --> 16:31.840
So that might actually be-

16:31.840 --> 16:32.800
His GPA is on there.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.160
His GPA is on here.

16:34.160 --> 16:34.880
Can I say something?

16:34.880 --> 16:37.040
His SAT and his ACT, wow.

16:37.040 --> 16:38.160
He fucked them both up.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.320
He did a really bad job on both tests.

16:40.320 --> 16:41.600
Yeah, very substandard.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.960
Like really super bad.

16:43.600 --> 16:48.240
All the stuff that we see in like movies and TV shows

16:48.240 --> 16:50.320
where it's like your extracurriculars

16:50.320 --> 16:51.680
and all that stuff,

16:51.680 --> 16:53.200
does that stuff actually matter?

16:53.200 --> 16:57.760
Like I didn't like super do a great job applying to colleges

16:57.760 --> 16:59.360
and got into the University of Oklahoma

16:59.360 --> 17:00.880
because I was a National Merit Scholar.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.480
I never really went through the application process.

17:06.480 --> 17:11.520
Is it that in depth where they like would even care?

17:11.520 --> 17:14.080
Like do they even check like your Facebook profile?

17:14.080 --> 17:15.200
Do they care that much?

17:15.200 --> 17:16.000
Oh, they definitely do.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.240
Just like you got money, you're not dumb, get in here.

17:18.240 --> 17:21.280
Oh no, they definitely do a deep dive.

17:21.280 --> 17:23.040
A hundred percent.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.560
They are getting deep down in there.

17:24.560 --> 17:24.960
You're sure?

17:25.520 --> 17:28.080
Oh my God, yes.

17:28.080 --> 17:31.920
Oh, every single applicant, they do a full blown deep dive.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.760
Oops, looks like you said a racist thing

17:33.760 --> 17:35.840
three and a half years ago, you're out.

17:35.840 --> 17:37.040
Well, then they're like, listen,

17:37.040 --> 17:38.720
there are lots of kids in them colleges.

17:38.720 --> 17:40.880
There must be a pretty loose guy where they're like,

17:40.880 --> 17:43.280
okay, we take off 12 of these boxes.

17:43.280 --> 17:46.160
No, that's why there's no racist kids in college anywhere.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.120
That explains it.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.000
I've been wondering why they-

17:48.000 --> 17:50.160
You say one racist thing and you're out.

17:50.160 --> 17:51.440
Unless you go to RacistU.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.960
Yeah, there you're welcome with open arms.

17:54.960 --> 17:56.400
Open racist arms.

17:56.400 --> 17:57.680
I can't, I-

17:59.440 --> 18:00.400
What if this person's applying-

18:00.400 --> 18:02.320
RacistU is actually my safety school.

18:02.320 --> 18:04.800
What if this person is applying to vape university?

18:07.600 --> 18:09.200
Vapin' and Baitin' university

18:09.200 --> 18:10.880
where they always teach you how to vape and bait

18:10.880 --> 18:13.280
and you've shown a lack of proficiency with those things.

18:13.280 --> 18:14.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:14.000 --> 18:14.800
Or no, no, no.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.440
Or because you got started in the game so young,

18:17.440 --> 18:22.000
though maybe they might hire you to be like a TA

18:22.000 --> 18:22.800
or something like that.

18:24.160 --> 18:27.760
Okay, I think that whether or not a school's gonna do

18:27.760 --> 18:30.960
this deep of a dive depends on the quality of school

18:30.960 --> 18:31.760
you are attending.

18:31.760 --> 18:36.240
For example, I live in Huntington and applied to Marshall

18:36.240 --> 18:38.000
and if you live in Huntington and apply to Marshall,

18:38.000 --> 18:39.200
they're just like, yeah, cool, come on.

18:39.760 --> 18:41.520
They just assumed you were already going there.

18:42.480 --> 18:43.440
Oh man, do you know Greg?

18:44.000 --> 18:44.640
You're in.

18:44.640 --> 18:45.920
Yeah, cool, come on in.

18:45.920 --> 18:48.720
But isn't it kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy

18:48.720 --> 18:51.280
where if you are the sort of person

18:51.280 --> 18:56.400
that is combing Yahoo Answers for data about vaping

18:56.400 --> 19:00.960
and baiting, you are probably not looking at a top tier school?

19:00.960 --> 19:03.360
Is that inaccurate, do you think?

19:03.360 --> 19:05.360
That's hateful, that's hateful, that's hateful.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.440
That's hateful because you know what that means, Justin?

19:07.440 --> 19:08.160
What?

19:08.160 --> 19:10.240
This person's got a fucking curious

19:10.880 --> 19:12.400
and therefore beautiful mind.

19:13.760 --> 19:14.560
I'm not worried about the person-

19:14.560 --> 19:16.000
Have you seen that movie Beautiful Mind

19:16.000 --> 19:17.920
where all he does is vape and bait?

19:17.920 --> 19:20.080
And get on Yahoo Answers and make sure he's doing both

19:20.080 --> 19:21.520
as good as he possibly can.

19:21.520 --> 19:25.040
I also enjoy that this gentleman or lady

19:25.040 --> 19:27.840
is worried enough about this to ask Yahoo Answers

19:27.840 --> 19:29.120
but not so worried about it

19:29.120 --> 19:31.920
that they're going to just delete their Yahoo Answers account.

19:31.920 --> 19:35.120
Like, oh, I might need some of that information again.

19:35.120 --> 19:35.760
It's gonna be harder to index.

19:35.760 --> 19:37.200
Because if they don't get into college,

19:37.200 --> 19:38.720
they need a place to learn things.

19:38.720 --> 19:42.320
My point is, my non-hateful point, Justin, is this.

19:42.320 --> 19:46.640
I'm not worried about the person who gets on Yahoo Answers

19:46.640 --> 19:50.320
to learn how to optimize and streamline their jerking

19:50.320 --> 19:53.520
and their smirking, which is what I call vaping now.

19:54.560 --> 19:55.520
I'm not worried about that person.

19:55.520 --> 19:58.320
I'm worried about the person who does both for the first time

19:58.320 --> 20:00.800
and is like, yeah, this seems about right.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.400
And then they are lazy about it

20:02.400 --> 20:03.600
and they don't hone their craft.

20:03.600 --> 20:06.960
This person has a curious mind, a hungry mind.

20:06.960 --> 20:09.520
And that's exactly the kind of person that I want

20:09.520 --> 20:11.840
attending my new program at Harvard.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.440
Welcome to the club, Steven.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.640
And by club, I mean the school club.

20:16.640 --> 20:17.360
It's just a school.

20:17.360 --> 20:19.040
They said it's called vape and bait.

20:19.040 --> 20:19.920
It's, yeah.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.200
Tyra went to Yale Business School,

20:21.200 --> 20:22.560
took some business classes there.

20:22.560 --> 20:26.400
Yeah, and that's exactly why I've decided to follow her

20:26.400 --> 20:28.960
into the fucking fungible battlefield.

20:29.680 --> 20:32.400
My sister and her husband are a few years younger

20:32.400 --> 20:33.200
than my wife and I.

20:33.200 --> 20:34.480
We're all in our 20s.

20:34.480 --> 20:37.200
Whenever we're together, they complain about how poor they are

20:37.200 --> 20:38.320
at one point or another.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.120
In this neck of the woods, it's called poor-mouthing.

20:41.120 --> 20:42.400
Is that an expression that she's used there?

20:42.400 --> 20:43.360
Is that really a thing?

20:43.360 --> 20:43.860
Yeah.

20:44.720 --> 20:46.960
Sydney's like, Sydney's grandparents used to say it.

20:46.960 --> 20:47.840
She's told me.

20:47.840 --> 20:49.360
It's just like saying you're poor when you're not?

20:50.080 --> 20:51.200
Just saying you're poor.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.040
Like just talking about being poor.

20:53.040 --> 20:54.240
Like poor-mouthing.

20:54.240 --> 20:59.200
Anyway, at the same time, I see them making expensive purchases.

20:59.200 --> 21:02.000
A huge telescope to look at the blood moon eclipse.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.640
An air rifle with the same caliber as a 22 rifle.

21:04.640 --> 21:07.120
I'm gonna, tonight's the night, baby.

21:07.120 --> 21:09.920
We're, tonight's the night, baby, we're gonna kill the moon.

21:09.920 --> 21:10.400
Wait, no, wait.

21:10.400 --> 21:11.440
Now line up the shot.

21:11.440 --> 21:13.280
Tell me where to aim.

21:13.280 --> 21:15.440
A huge telescope to look at the blood moon eclipse.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.680
An air rifle with the same caliber as a 22 rifle.

21:19.120 --> 21:20.240
Silver bullets.

21:20.240 --> 21:21.280
Some shackles.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.400
Wait a minute.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.840
These people are werewolf hunters.

21:24.800 --> 21:27.040
But I know for a fact they make a lot more money.

21:27.040 --> 21:29.440
No, you skipped an important part of the puzzle.

21:29.440 --> 21:29.920
Okay.

21:29.920 --> 21:30.720
Another gift that they got.

21:30.720 --> 21:33.840
The air rifle and they got us really nice gifts for our new baby.

21:33.840 --> 21:36.560
But I know for a fact they make a lot more money than we do

21:36.560 --> 21:39.120
and don't have any right to complain to us.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.520
How do I get them to stop claiming they're poor

21:41.520 --> 21:43.200
when I know they're not?

21:43.200 --> 21:46.480
That's from actually poor in Atchison, Kansas.

21:48.800 --> 21:51.840
Yeah, I mean, I feel like it's just sort of a good rule of thumb

21:51.840 --> 21:55.280
to pretend in social situations with family and friends

21:55.280 --> 21:57.920
like money just does not exist.

21:57.920 --> 22:01.440
Yeah, I feel like that was the, like the thing that

22:01.440 --> 22:02.720
I was kind of raised like,

22:02.720 --> 22:04.400
don't ask someone how much money they make.

22:04.400 --> 22:05.920
Don't talk about like how much money you have.

22:05.920 --> 22:08.640
Do you remember when we used to ask mom and dad like,

22:09.360 --> 22:10.240
are we poor?

22:10.240 --> 22:11.680
Because they didn't like buy us stuff.

22:11.680 --> 22:14.880
Like our like spoiled friends would get their parents

22:14.880 --> 22:15.760
would buy them stuff.

22:15.760 --> 22:17.680
And mom and dad would always like dodge the question.

22:17.680 --> 22:19.920
I'd be like, oh shit, I don't know if we're poor or not.

22:19.920 --> 22:22.880
And now looking back, I see like, of course we weren't poor.

22:22.880 --> 22:24.480
We just weren't fucking spoiled.

22:24.480 --> 22:26.480
Like they didn't just buy us shit constantly.

22:27.680 --> 22:31.120
I worked at one of the many jobs I have worked.

22:31.120 --> 22:34.640
Like a dude on like his first day looked me in the face

22:34.640 --> 22:36.560
and said, how much do you get paid here?

22:37.520 --> 22:40.320
And it was like, oh, go fuck yourself.

22:40.320 --> 22:44.000
Like, I don't want to tell you at all.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.880
Like what possible good could come from me discussing

22:46.880 --> 22:48.320
how much money I make.

22:48.320 --> 22:50.800
I just say, I just tell people what tax bracket I'm in.

22:52.400 --> 22:52.720
Three.

22:53.280 --> 22:54.480
Three, I'm in the third one.

22:55.440 --> 22:56.240
I'm in the third one.

22:56.240 --> 22:57.200
Which one are you?

22:57.200 --> 22:58.880
Oh, I'm in blue.

22:58.880 --> 23:01.200
I really don't think there's like, okay.

23:01.200 --> 23:04.400
The problem with engaging with this issue for you

23:04.400 --> 23:06.880
question asker is like, you cannot,

23:07.840 --> 23:10.720
if you try to challenge them on like the telescope

23:10.720 --> 23:14.160
or the rifle, you're opening up a discussion

23:14.160 --> 23:17.040
that you severely do not want to have.

23:17.040 --> 23:19.280
Like the first time you challenge like,

23:19.280 --> 23:20.560
maybe you aren't poor.

23:20.560 --> 23:23.440
Like that is going to be the rest of your afternoon.

23:23.440 --> 23:23.920
Yeah, sure.

23:23.920 --> 23:25.840
I needed that telescope for my work.

23:27.120 --> 23:28.880
Well, and also what this is, is like-

23:28.880 --> 23:29.760
As a scientist.

23:31.120 --> 23:32.640
As a moon hunter.

23:32.640 --> 23:35.360
This is also like a matter of like everybody's,

23:36.240 --> 23:37.440
it's all relative, right?

23:37.440 --> 23:39.040
So like, maybe they are poor

23:39.040 --> 23:41.440
because they're spending their disposable income

23:41.440 --> 23:45.200
on stuff like telescopes and rifles and shit.

23:45.200 --> 23:46.160
I've got all my money.

23:46.160 --> 23:48.480
I've got my money in telescope futures.

23:49.520 --> 23:51.680
But like, and so like, if you sit there and go,

23:51.680 --> 23:53.120
like you're not poor, they're like, yeah.

23:53.120 --> 23:56.880
Like we can't afford to like fly to Hawaii

23:56.880 --> 23:58.560
and be like, okay, well that doesn't mean you're poor.

23:58.560 --> 24:00.480
But to them, maybe it does.

24:00.480 --> 24:00.720
Yeah, sure.

24:00.720 --> 24:03.440
And so it's such a relative term that trying to argue

24:03.440 --> 24:06.000
with someone whether they are poor or not

24:06.000 --> 24:07.280
is like trying to argue with someone

24:07.280 --> 24:08.640
whether they're happy or not.

24:08.640 --> 24:08.880
Yeah.

24:08.880 --> 24:09.440
You know what I mean?

24:09.440 --> 24:10.960
Maybe they're so egregiously bad with money

24:10.960 --> 24:14.160
that they do not understand the direct correlation

24:14.160 --> 24:17.040
between buying telescopes and being poor.

24:17.040 --> 24:17.360
Like they-

24:17.360 --> 24:19.440
I've gone over the finances a thousand times.

24:19.440 --> 24:22.480
What is this here where 20% of your income

24:22.480 --> 24:23.760
is going to telescopes?

24:23.760 --> 24:25.680
Oh, but that's like, that's not-

24:25.680 --> 24:27.120
That is non-negotiable.

24:27.120 --> 24:28.080
That's in the telescope.

24:28.080 --> 24:29.840
See, we budgeted for telescopes.

24:29.840 --> 24:32.880
Yeah, we actually underspent on telescopes

24:32.880 --> 24:33.920
if you can believe that.

24:33.920 --> 24:35.120
Yeah, we saved it.

24:35.120 --> 24:37.280
Every week they get an email from Mint

24:37.280 --> 24:40.160
or some other financial planner just like,

24:40.160 --> 24:42.720
what the fuck are you guys doing?

24:43.600 --> 24:45.920
Credit with the teller that you have like a hoarding.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.360
It's a weird telescope hoarding.

24:47.360 --> 24:48.560
Hey, just a quick update.

24:48.560 --> 24:51.120
You spent a little bit more than you did last month

24:51.120 --> 24:52.320
on going out to eat.

24:52.320 --> 24:55.040
And also stop buying so many fucking telescopes.

24:55.040 --> 24:55.920
But you say that now.

24:55.920 --> 24:59.520
But when this sister alerts you to the fact

24:59.520 --> 25:01.200
that there's an asteroid heading to Earth

25:01.200 --> 25:03.120
and they reveal that they spent all of their money

25:03.120 --> 25:05.520
on an escape pod, you're gonna be happy.

25:05.520 --> 25:06.000
They're poor.

25:06.560 --> 25:09.360
An escape pod from Earth made of telescopes.

25:11.680 --> 25:12.880
This is not airtight.

25:13.520 --> 25:14.800
It has no propulsion.

25:14.800 --> 25:17.760
There's no propulsion system and we're all gonna die.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.320
But we're broke.

25:20.320 --> 25:21.840
But we're broke, so whatever.

25:21.840 --> 25:23.040
Yeah, we died penniless.

25:23.040 --> 25:23.840
It's good timing.

25:23.840 --> 25:25.600
Justin, Travis, how much money do you guys have?

25:26.480 --> 25:26.800
Right now?

25:26.800 --> 25:27.600
On me right now?

25:27.600 --> 25:30.720
Yeah, like how are you doing financially?

25:30.720 --> 25:33.360
I have 40 Canadian dollars that for the life of me,

25:33.360 --> 25:34.480
I cannot fucking understand.

25:34.480 --> 25:36.000
Bro, I was cleaning out my underwear drawer

25:36.000 --> 25:37.200
because I bought a new chest of drawers.

25:37.200 --> 25:40.240
So you know how Chiboy's doing.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.800
You know that new Drake song?

25:44.080 --> 25:45.920
I check out my new chest of drawers.

25:46.720 --> 25:50.080
What if Drake only wrote songs that sort of obfuscated

25:50.080 --> 25:51.440
how he's doing financially?

25:51.440 --> 25:59.600
Like started from the bottom and now I'm somewhere.

25:59.600 --> 26:02.160
He just writes a song called Comfortable Lifestyle.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.120
It started from the bottom.

26:03.120 --> 26:04.640
I'm not on the bottom anymore.

26:05.920 --> 26:06.720
I got, you know what?

26:06.720 --> 26:07.360
Fuck it.

26:07.360 --> 26:08.800
The song is started from the bottom.

26:08.800 --> 26:09.440
Now we're here.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.120
That could mean anything.

26:12.880 --> 26:15.120
I preferred his follow up song.

26:15.120 --> 26:16.480
And now I'm there.

26:16.480 --> 26:17.120
And I'm there.

26:17.120 --> 26:17.760
And I'm there.

26:17.760 --> 26:18.480
And you're there.

26:19.040 --> 26:20.640
Maybe a little bit higher.

26:20.640 --> 26:21.920
Maybe a little bit lower.

26:21.920 --> 26:22.640
It's hard to say.

26:22.640 --> 26:23.200
It's hard to say.

26:23.200 --> 26:25.920
Any given day, cash flow problems.

26:26.640 --> 26:28.240
We all have cash flow problems.

26:28.880 --> 26:32.480
And he's got that one that's like 1-800 hotline bling.

26:32.480 --> 26:34.160
And that sounds all about how

26:34.160 --> 26:35.840
now he's a little bit lower than he was last week

26:35.840 --> 26:37.760
because he bought so many fucking telescopes.

26:37.760 --> 26:40.240
He loves them because he uses them to look back into Canada.

26:40.240 --> 26:42.240
He misses it so much, but he can't go back.

26:42.240 --> 26:43.280
And he wanted to do that thing.

26:43.280 --> 26:45.520
He wanted to point two telescopes at each other

26:45.520 --> 26:48.160
and look down one telescope into the other telescope

26:48.160 --> 26:49.360
to see if like you can see.

26:49.360 --> 26:51.520
To see what's going on in the universe.

26:51.520 --> 26:52.720
How telescopes work.

26:52.720 --> 26:56.400
My sister and her husband, Drake, keep buying telescopes

26:56.400 --> 26:57.680
and complain about how poor they are.

27:00.560 --> 27:01.440
Should we go to the money zone

27:01.440 --> 27:03.520
so we can get some telescope scratch?

27:03.520 --> 27:04.480
Yeah, absolutely.

27:04.480 --> 27:16.640
I could just turn these scopes.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.240
I don't know why we're so concerned about money

27:18.240 --> 27:20.480
because we're all about to be trillionaires.

27:21.760 --> 27:23.520
We're all about to be chameleonaires

27:23.520 --> 27:26.560
because we've learned how to work that hallway

27:26.560 --> 27:27.840
like it is a runway.

27:27.840 --> 27:31.200
We want to advertise our new beautainment business

27:31.200 --> 27:32.480
with a new website.

27:32.480 --> 27:34.080
Where can I turn for something like that?

27:34.080 --> 27:35.280
I don't know anything about anything.

27:35.280 --> 27:36.000
I'm an idiot.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.840
Yeah, you are a big dumb animal.

27:37.840 --> 27:39.920
But I'd recommend going to Squarespace.

27:44.320 --> 27:46.960
I don't know if you guys are getting those in your regions.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.400
But I see those commercials and I go,

27:48.400 --> 27:50.480
damn, that's a well-made commercial.

Actually, if you want to make a fan site

28:10.160 --> 28:13.440
to the Phil Collins album, No Jacket Required,

you can do that on squarespace.com.

28:15.120 --> 28:16.880
Yeah, and you also don't need to know

28:16.880 --> 28:18.960
anything about the album No Jacket Required.

Nothing is required of you.

28:24.720 --> 28:26.720
Please make a website about No Jacket Required

28:26.720 --> 28:28.560
that is obviously coming from you,

28:28.560 --> 28:30.800
a place of you never having heard the album,

28:30.800 --> 28:32.320
knowing nothing about Phil Collins,

28:32.320 --> 28:34.080
knowing nothing about his line of music.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.640
But I do need a track-by-track breakdown

28:36.640 --> 28:38.080
with the actual track listings.

28:38.080 --> 28:40.160
I want that as my fucking homepage.

28:40.160 --> 28:41.440

Underpants.

28:52.080 --> 28:52.640
Oh, good.

28:54.240 --> 28:56.320
I'm just, I'm trying to keep it fresh

28:56.320 --> 28:57.680
because we've talked about me undies,

28:57.680 --> 28:59.760
we told you that they're the most amazing underpants

28:59.760 --> 29:00.720
on the planet. If you want to keep it fresh,

29:00.720 --> 29:02.160
I recommend putting me undies on.

29:02.720 --> 29:03.440
Me undies.

29:03.440 --> 29:06.480
It's like a fucking refrigerator crisper drawer

29:06.480 --> 29:07.520
for your bits.

29:07.520 --> 29:08.560
Me undies.

29:08.560 --> 29:09.520
Ooh, God, no.

29:09.520 --> 29:10.800
Oh, let's do this, let's do this.

29:10.800 --> 29:13.680
I'll say me undies and then you guys throw in a tagline.

29:13.680 --> 29:14.480
You ready?

29:14.480 --> 29:15.040
Yeah.

29:15.040 --> 29:15.360
Yeah.

29:15.360 --> 29:16.000
Me undies.

29:17.760 --> 29:19.440
Put your dick in the crisper.

29:19.440 --> 29:20.160
Me undies.

29:22.400 --> 29:24.640
They're like hammocks for your ding dong.

29:24.640 --> 29:25.280
There we go.

29:26.640 --> 29:28.240
Well, both of those were for men.

29:28.240 --> 29:28.640
We need-

29:28.640 --> 29:29.440
Okay, let's try one more.

29:29.440 --> 29:31.280
Let's try for women minor products.

29:31.280 --> 29:33.120
Okay, me undies.

29:33.120 --> 29:34.800
Put your vagina in a crisper.

29:37.360 --> 29:37.860
Nice.

29:37.860 --> 29:43.780
If you go to meundies.com slash my brother,

29:43.780 --> 29:46.100
you get 20% off your first order.

29:46.100 --> 29:50.020
And listen, we talk a lot of bullshit on this show,

29:50.020 --> 29:54.340
you guys, a lot of bullshit, but it is not bullshit

29:54.340 --> 29:58.340
when I say me undies are easily my favorite thing

29:58.340 --> 30:00.500
I've ever put on my body.

30:01.220 --> 30:02.900
Yesterday, I bought a new chest of drawers.

30:02.900 --> 30:03.620
Did you guys hear the news?

30:04.420 --> 30:06.180
I heard about that Drake song.

30:06.180 --> 30:08.820
You hear about Griffin's chest of drawers by Drake.

30:08.820 --> 30:13.220
Bought a new chest of drawers and I moved all my stuff over

30:13.220 --> 30:18.900
and I very deliberately put my me undies

30:18.900 --> 30:21.380
at the top of my collection just so when I open it up-

30:21.380 --> 30:22.020
Oh, for sure.

30:22.020 --> 30:24.580
I look like fucking, I look like Robert,

30:24.580 --> 30:25.860
that's probably what Robert Downey Jr.

30:25.860 --> 30:26.420
sounded weird.

30:26.420 --> 30:28.900
Me undies sent me a new product.

30:28.900 --> 30:29.540
What the fuck?

30:30.180 --> 30:33.300
Lounge pants made from me undies material.

30:34.020 --> 30:34.420
Suck it.

30:34.420 --> 30:35.380
I forgot to tell you guys.

30:35.380 --> 30:36.340
Suck it.

30:36.340 --> 30:37.300
Why didn't I get that?

30:37.300 --> 30:38.500
They sent me me undies.

30:38.500 --> 30:39.540
Wear my pants.

30:39.540 --> 30:43.220
They sent to Sydney and I and they are amazing.

30:43.220 --> 30:46.260
Imagine if you could just wear underwear to Kroger.

30:46.260 --> 30:47.700
Now you can, thanks me undies.

30:48.740 --> 30:50.100
I got a personal message here.

30:50.100 --> 30:51.220
Did we do the thing?

30:51.220 --> 30:52.740
Go to meundies.com slash my brother,

30:52.740 --> 30:54.660
get 20% off your first order if you don't love them.

30:54.660 --> 30:56.500
Your first pair is gonna be free, but you're gonna love them.

30:56.500 --> 30:57.700
So shut up.

30:58.420 --> 31:00.420
I got a message, I got a personal message here.

31:00.420 --> 31:03.300
Is it the one for Jackson Cusack?

31:03.300 --> 31:05.060
Yeah, for the Jack sack.

31:05.060 --> 31:08.100
Is it the one from Jason Yu or is it a different one?

31:08.100 --> 31:10.820
Yeah, from the Jayce Yu for the Jack sack.

31:10.820 --> 31:14.580
We often get personal messages that have in jokes in them

31:14.580 --> 31:16.020
between the two people.

31:16.020 --> 31:18.020
I think this one sets the record for like

31:18.740 --> 31:20.820
highest number of in jokes.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.060
This is fucking, this is thought.

31:23.060 --> 31:23.940
Justin read it.

31:23.940 --> 31:26.180
This is thought spaghetti is what this is.

31:26.180 --> 31:27.780
You're today's soft rock.

31:27.780 --> 31:30.020
The Ewok wizard on my skateboard.

31:30.020 --> 31:31.780
The Spider-Man on my Canada day.

31:31.780 --> 31:35.300
Don't let the coke take your blue steel and sex appeal.

31:36.100 --> 31:39.460
Vivi will always be there with polar bears, fishnets,

31:40.020 --> 31:41.940
faux afterwards and fire.

31:42.820 --> 31:44.340
Never stop goofing.

31:44.340 --> 31:45.540
Keep it going.

31:45.540 --> 31:48.420
Now what I really hope is that Jackson listened to that

31:48.420 --> 31:51.780
and was like, what the fuck are you talking about?

31:51.780 --> 31:52.980
Are you having aphasia?

31:52.980 --> 31:53.780
Like that doesn't.

31:54.420 --> 31:56.420
Can I do another one?

31:56.420 --> 32:00.180
That's like real, like Jack sack's gonna get some like

32:00.180 --> 32:02.740
like actual information out of.

32:02.740 --> 32:03.220
Yes.

32:03.220 --> 32:03.860
Okay.

32:03.860 --> 32:04.660
Hey Jack sack.

32:04.660 --> 32:05.860
It's your boy Jason Yu.

32:06.740 --> 32:09.380
Thanks for coming with me on that trip to Boulder,

32:09.380 --> 32:12.260
Colorado three weekends ago.

32:12.260 --> 32:15.700
I had a really good time and I agree with everything

32:15.700 --> 32:20.180
that you said about patriotism.

32:20.180 --> 32:21.940
Thanks for vibing and keeping it tight.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.300
Thanks for vibing and keeping it tight.

32:23.300 --> 32:25.220
If you need me, I'll hit me on my Moby.

32:27.220 --> 32:27.940
And also-

32:27.940 --> 32:30.020
If you need me, I'll be hanging out with the Moby.

32:30.020 --> 32:31.540
And also I love you.

32:31.540 --> 32:32.420
I got a message.

32:32.420 --> 32:34.260
You're a good friend, Jack sack.

32:34.260 --> 32:36.740
From your boy, Jason Yu.

32:36.740 --> 32:39.860
A message for Lauren from Seamus says,

32:39.860 --> 32:42.180
hi banana bread, happy anniversary.

32:42.180 --> 32:43.700
That was very enthusiastic.

32:43.700 --> 32:44.180
Let me try.

32:44.180 --> 32:45.540
Hi banana bread.

32:45.540 --> 32:47.060
Hi banana bread.

32:47.060 --> 32:48.420
Hola banana bread.

32:50.740 --> 32:53.780
Happy anniversary and birthday to my favorite person

32:53.780 --> 32:54.340
in the world.

32:54.340 --> 32:57.620
I can't wait to fly cross country with you to Vancouver

32:57.620 --> 32:59.380
to see MBM live.

32:59.380 --> 33:00.820
Holy shit.

33:02.980 --> 33:04.980
That was in August.

33:05.700 --> 33:08.100
That was two calendar months ago.

33:08.100 --> 33:08.980
I'm so sorry.

33:08.980 --> 33:12.180
You did wait, in fact, to do that.

33:12.180 --> 33:12.900
You're the best.

33:13.620 --> 33:15.380
People, we've warned you before.

33:15.940 --> 33:19.460
Stop, like don't even reference who the president is.

33:22.900 --> 33:24.660
I hope you're getting this at a time

33:24.660 --> 33:26.420
and we're both still alive.

33:26.420 --> 33:29.540
Well, good times or not are had by some or all.

33:31.700 --> 33:34.500
Can you believe that did or didn't happen together

33:34.500 --> 33:36.180
for not forever?

33:36.180 --> 33:39.300
I'm glad I'm glad we were allowed to commune

33:39.300 --> 33:43.540
for one hour under the laws of President Bebeborp,

33:43.540 --> 33:45.860
the robot that controls humanity.

33:45.860 --> 33:47.380
You're the best and I love you.

33:47.380 --> 33:50.660
P.S. Vancouver is dripping with Tim Hortons locations,

33:50.660 --> 33:53.700
so you will not go wanting for a cooler.

33:53.700 --> 33:55.780
Man, that last day we were in Vancouver,

33:55.780 --> 33:57.780
Justin, you had to leave super early in the morning.

33:58.740 --> 34:01.300
But Travis and Teresa and I tried to get in

34:01.300 --> 34:04.980
on this fancy restaurant to get like a fancy brunch.

34:04.980 --> 34:06.340
They like fancy Belgian waffles

34:06.340 --> 34:07.300
and I was very excited about it.

34:07.300 --> 34:09.300
It's called Medina, Vancouverites.

34:09.300 --> 34:10.740
I'm sure you've been there and you love it.

34:10.740 --> 34:12.660
And it's downpouring and there's such a long line

34:12.660 --> 34:13.780
and we were so miserable.

34:13.780 --> 34:15.300
And we're like, fuck it, turn the corner.

34:15.300 --> 34:18.340
Tim Hortons right there caught us up in its loving arms.

34:18.340 --> 34:22.340
I ate it and I had the strength of 10 men all day.

34:23.940 --> 34:24.440
All day.

34:24.440 --> 34:25.560
I'm Dave Holmes.

34:25.560 --> 34:28.200
And if you've been missing my show, International Waters,

34:28.200 --> 34:29.720
then you've been missing this.

34:29.720 --> 34:31.720
If there's one thing I know about owls,

34:31.720 --> 34:33.080
they are wise, two things.

34:33.080 --> 34:35.880
They are wise, they love nightclubs.

34:35.880 --> 34:38.120
They wear tiny graduation motorboards

34:38.120 --> 34:39.800
and they love nightclubs.

34:40.360 --> 34:44.040
They also do the best double takes of all birds of prey.

34:44.040 --> 34:46.200
And if you slow it down, they actually go,

34:46.200 --> 34:47.000
get it out, get it out.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
International Waters, a panel show

34:51.000 --> 34:53.080
where US and UK comedians battle

34:53.080 --> 34:54.760
for pop culture supremacy.

How about a Yahoo?

34:59.320 --> 35:00.680
You know you want this shit.

35:00.680 --> 35:01.960
Yeah, OK, fine.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.480
This Yahoo was sent in by Level 9000 Yajra Drew

35:05.480 --> 35:06.600
at Drew Davenport.

35:06.600 --> 35:07.320
Thank you, Drew.

35:07.320 --> 35:10.440
It's by Yajra Answers user Lele, who asks,

35:12.520 --> 35:14.040
how did you learn how to beatbox?

35:15.640 --> 35:17.320
I'm really trying to learn the basic sounds,

35:17.320 --> 35:19.720
but the only thing I can't do is the inward snare.

35:19.720 --> 35:22.520
Well, I don't think I'm doing it right.

35:22.520 --> 35:25.560
At least, what are some websites or videos to watch?

35:25.560 --> 35:27.320
Justin, Travis, I put the question to you

35:27.960 --> 35:30.120
because I'll tell you, Beauty Taynors,

35:30.120 --> 35:31.800
there is a performance element to it.

35:33.320 --> 35:35.480
I don't think anyone should do the inward snare.

35:36.520 --> 35:37.080
Travis!

35:39.640 --> 35:40.360
Inward.

35:41.080 --> 35:42.120
Oh, God.

35:42.120 --> 35:52.760
I don't even know what that sound is.

35:52.760 --> 35:57.800
Justin does this fun thing whenever he's on set with Biz

35:57.800 --> 36:00.840
where he just eats spaghetti.

36:00.840 --> 36:02.920
And while he has that spaghetti in there,

36:03.640 --> 36:06.360
while he's eating that olive garden to go,

36:06.360 --> 36:09.400
he does it with the pasta in and around his mouth.

36:09.400 --> 36:10.280
It's really fucking incredible.

36:10.280 --> 36:13.400
I just made that sound and it made the side of my tongue buzz.

36:13.400 --> 36:14.360
Really weird.

36:14.360 --> 36:15.320
Yeah, that's really weird.

36:15.320 --> 36:16.840
I can't unfeel it.

36:16.840 --> 36:19.080
Yeah, that's music, baby.

36:19.080 --> 36:21.240
That's the music leaving your body.

36:21.240 --> 36:24.920
That's your tongue orgasming with the pleasure of creating.

36:25.560 --> 36:27.160
How does anyone learn how to beatbox?

36:27.160 --> 36:28.360
Are there beatboxing schools?

36:28.360 --> 36:30.280
Are there beatboxing dojos?

36:31.160 --> 36:32.600
If it's anything, it's a dojo, yes.

36:32.600 --> 36:35.000
I'm pretty sure they just sneeze over and over again

36:35.000 --> 36:36.120
and think, well, that sounds good.

36:36.120 --> 36:38.920
I tried to do that one.

36:38.920 --> 36:40.440
Wait, do that again, Sneezy Steve.

36:40.440 --> 36:41.640
Do that again, sneeze.

36:43.240 --> 36:44.360
Sneeze wouldn't be an expression creative name.

36:44.360 --> 36:47.000
Please, I told you, my beatbox name is Puss Sneeze.

36:47.960 --> 36:49.880
I've told you guys so many times.

36:49.880 --> 36:50.920
Shut up, Drake.

36:50.920 --> 36:51.560
Puss Sneeze?

36:52.280 --> 36:52.920
Puss Sneeze.

36:52.920 --> 36:53.960
There's an apostrophe.

36:53.960 --> 36:55.480
It's like a P'Zone, I think.

36:57.560 --> 37:00.280
Yeah, I think this is probably one of many things

37:00.280 --> 37:01.400
you can learn to do on YouTube.

37:01.400 --> 37:02.440
Things I learned on YouTube.

37:02.440 --> 37:04.840
I fixed my garbage disposal the other day.

37:04.840 --> 37:06.680
Just got out the- While learning to beatbox?

37:06.680 --> 37:07.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:07.480 --> 37:09.160
I had them going on two different devices.

37:09.720 --> 37:11.800
I was like fixing up this hole in the sink.

37:13.960 --> 37:16.040
I guarantee with the sheer amount of shit

37:16.040 --> 37:17.720
that's on YouTube, you could Google,

37:18.360 --> 37:21.560
teach me how to both beatbox

37:21.560 --> 37:24.040
and fix my garbage disposal at the same time

37:24.040 --> 37:25.880
and you would get like 10 hits.

37:25.880 --> 37:28.120
Yeah, from like Expert Village.

37:28.120 --> 37:29.640
Hi, my name is Phillip.

37:29.640 --> 37:32.840
Hi, this is Phillip from Expert Village.

37:32.840 --> 37:36.680
Watch me do.

37:36.680 --> 37:37.400
And we're done.

37:38.120 --> 37:39.720
Now, Griffin, it sounds like you were doing

37:39.720 --> 37:41.640
a combination of beatboxing and scatting.

37:49.480 --> 37:51.480
Which one of- Hey, guys, which one of the three

37:51.480 --> 37:53.480
of us do you think is the best beatboxer?

37:53.480 --> 37:54.680
Probably me.

37:54.680 --> 37:56.280
I think it's Justin, hands down.

37:56.280 --> 37:58.920
I just imagined in my head when I said that.

37:58.920 --> 38:02.440
When I just said that, I imagined in my head

38:02.440 --> 38:08.920
the image of a YouTube, sorry, YouTube clip.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.360
Have you been to JawTube?

38:10.360 --> 38:12.520
Have you been to JawTube yet?

38:12.520 --> 38:16.040
No, the image of a YouTube clip began when I said that.

38:16.040 --> 38:21.480
Like that is the beginning of this slam dunk bit.

38:21.480 --> 38:24.840
Which one of us is the best beatboxer?

38:24.840 --> 38:26.440
That is the question that I posed to you.

38:26.440 --> 38:32.680
Well, I think Justin.

38:32.680 --> 38:35.240
I've never heard you beatbox before that I can remember.

38:35.240 --> 38:37.960
I've never heard any of the three of us beatbox in my life.

38:37.960 --> 38:39.080
I bet it's you.

38:39.080 --> 38:41.160
Including and not limited to myself.

38:41.160 --> 38:42.760
I've never heard myself beatbox.

38:43.320 --> 38:45.480
So this is largely a theoretical discussion.

38:45.480 --> 38:48.520
I can do the in like the bass drum hits,

38:49.320 --> 38:52.280
you know, boom, boom, boom, that kind of thing.

38:52.280 --> 38:56.680
But that's more like a heavy hand knocking on the door.

38:56.680 --> 38:59.080
I could do the record scratch.

39:00.440 --> 39:01.960
But I'd have to warm up first.

39:01.960 --> 39:02.520
Can I try?

39:03.080 --> 39:04.360
Yes, drop it.

39:04.360 --> 39:05.800
I gotta get my lips really, really wet.

39:07.080 --> 39:08.040
All right, here I go.

39:08.040 --> 39:08.680
You got it.

39:08.680 --> 39:20.600
Kevin, are you proud of yourself right now?

39:23.880 --> 39:26.920
Right now we can't even sell ads against this hit bit.

39:26.920 --> 39:28.200
This is on YouTube.

39:28.200 --> 39:29.080
On JawTube.

39:30.200 --> 39:30.520
Hold on.

39:30.520 --> 39:31.240
Wait, let me try again.

39:33.400 --> 39:33.800
Kevin.

39:35.240 --> 39:35.960
Wow.

39:35.960 --> 39:36.840
Kevin, that's funny.

39:36.840 --> 39:39.320
You just you don't have like a Kevin.

39:39.320 --> 39:39.720
Hold on.

39:39.720 --> 39:40.600
I'm still working on it.

39:41.800 --> 39:43.880
You don't remember me, but we used to work together.

39:43.880 --> 39:45.240
I never worked in a funeral home.

39:45.240 --> 39:46.520
There's something I can leave for you, Slick Point.

39:46.520 --> 39:47.000
Hold on.

39:47.000 --> 39:47.480
It's coming.

39:48.760 --> 39:49.560
We're the men in black.

39:49.560 --> 39:51.160
We have a situation and we need your help.

39:52.200 --> 39:54.200
And that's the thing I say every time before I beatbox.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.440
Kevin, are you just watching Men in Black?

39:56.440 --> 39:57.000
What is that?

39:57.000 --> 40:07.880
Anyway, that's just one of the many routines

40:07.880 --> 40:09.880
I picked up on at school.

40:11.080 --> 40:13.560
Then Griffin, I just got to say that was excellent.

40:13.560 --> 40:14.520
Yeah, thank you.

40:14.520 --> 40:15.400
Let me just try one.

40:15.400 --> 40:15.800
Okay.

40:15.800 --> 40:16.520
Okay, cool.

40:16.520 --> 40:17.000
Here we go.

40:17.800 --> 40:20.120
Hi, I'm the baby brand new just out.

40:20.120 --> 40:20.840
Gotta love me.

40:20.840 --> 40:21.400
Come on.

40:21.400 --> 40:22.680
Gotta love me.

40:23.480 --> 40:24.280
No, that's just now.

40:24.280 --> 40:27.640
Justin, I'm the baby brand new just out.

40:27.640 --> 40:28.360
Gotta love me.

40:28.360 --> 40:29.000
Come on.

40:29.000 --> 40:29.720
Gotta love me.

40:29.720 --> 40:33.320
So that just sounds like the baby dinosaur from Dinosaurs.

40:39.480 --> 40:39.960
All right.

40:39.960 --> 40:40.360
That's the lead.

40:40.360 --> 40:41.720
Okay, now I would like to do one here.

40:41.720 --> 40:42.360
Yeah, okay.

40:42.360 --> 40:44.520
But I don't have my computer sound hooked up, Griffin.

40:44.520 --> 40:49.320
So if you could edit in some beatboxing here, that would be great.

40:49.320 --> 40:51.240
Yeah, I'm not going to remember to do that.

40:51.240 --> 40:56.120
Okay, we'll leave a moment of silence here for you to edit it in.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.920
And then let's leave an extra moment of silence just for this episode.

40:59.880 --> 41:03.640
Just like in remembrance of it because it died.

41:03.640 --> 41:05.240
The moment of silence begins now.

41:05.240 --> 41:06.520
Okay, because it died.

41:06.520 --> 41:08.840
No, you gotta be silent.

41:08.840 --> 41:09.080
Okay.

41:09.080 --> 41:20.840
In the arms of the angel, fly away from me.

41:20.840 --> 41:22.440
Oh, I spit on my pop filter.

41:23.400 --> 41:25.800
My dad loves playing the piano.

41:25.800 --> 41:28.280
It's his absolute favorite thing to do and he plays all the time.

41:28.840 --> 41:31.560
Problem is he's so god awful at it.

41:31.560 --> 41:32.520
He's been playing.

41:33.080 --> 41:35.560
Please fix my bad piano dad, brothers.

41:35.560 --> 41:36.600
See, that's all you need to say.

41:37.480 --> 41:38.920
Give him new piano hands.

41:39.880 --> 41:42.600
Please, sweet brothers, give my pop a new piano hands.

41:43.880 --> 41:45.960
Please fix his bad piano.

41:46.840 --> 41:48.600
He's got these stupid piano hands.

41:48.600 --> 41:50.360
He needs smart piano hands.

41:50.360 --> 41:51.240
Bionic dad.

41:51.880 --> 41:55.400
He's been playing ever since I can remember and has never improved.

41:55.400 --> 41:56.600
My mother agrees.

41:56.600 --> 41:58.760
We would say something, but my dad is really sensitive.

42:00.360 --> 42:04.840
Even asking if he could stop playing because I'm trying to take a nap hurts his feelings.

42:04.840 --> 42:05.720
What the fuck?

42:05.720 --> 42:09.880
How can I find a way to get my dad to start playing less often or hint

42:09.880 --> 42:11.480
at this without hurting his feelings?

42:11.480 --> 42:14.360
I'm moving on about three years and I don't know if I can last that long.

42:14.360 --> 42:15.720
Oh my god.

42:15.720 --> 42:17.080
Billy Joel Jr.

42:17.080 --> 42:17.240
No.

42:17.240 --> 42:22.120
No, that's from Bitter Daughter in beautiful British Columbia, Canada.

42:22.120 --> 42:22.600
That's an amazing question.

42:22.600 --> 42:27.080
I love the combination of an overly sensitive and really bad at piano dad.

42:27.080 --> 42:28.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:28.440 --> 42:34.360
Hey dad, you're doing a great job in there, but it's four in the morning.

42:34.360 --> 42:36.520
Do you think you could maybe keep it down a little bit?

42:39.720 --> 42:41.880
Keep on rocking in the free world.

42:42.440 --> 42:42.920
Thank you.

42:42.920 --> 42:50.440
Thank you.

42:50.440 --> 42:57.560
Now kids gather around the old key box because daddy's got a special surprise.

42:57.560 --> 42:58.920
It's Canon MD.

42:58.920 --> 43:02.280
I just figured out how to do Canon MD.

43:02.280 --> 43:02.680
Here it goes.

43:02.680 --> 43:04.760
Squinky dink dink dink dink dink.

43:04.760 --> 43:11.080
Squinkly dinky dinky dinky dinky dinky dinky dinky dinky dinky dinky dinky dinky dinky dinky dinky.

43:11.080 --> 43:14.600
Hey dad, did you hire the DJ for my Quinceanera?

43:14.600 --> 43:16.200
Oh, no need darlin'.

43:16.200 --> 43:23.320
I'm gonna play all the hits today on my old finger guitar here.

43:23.320 --> 43:24.680
Sing along if you know this one.

43:24.680 --> 43:25.800
Play us the song.

43:25.800 --> 43:26.920
You're the piano dad.

43:30.040 --> 43:31.240
Don't you know anything more modern?

43:31.880 --> 43:36.760
Penguins I can do cheerleader. Do you kids like cheerleader?

43:41.280 --> 43:43.280
This is

43:43.640 --> 43:47.560
Basically you're being held as an emotional hostage

43:47.560 --> 43:55.520
And you really we I know I've said this before your dad is set up quite the honeypot for you here an emotional

43:55.760 --> 44:01.120
Emotional honeypot you do need to pack your bags and move away you definitely that's the only solution for you

44:01.120 --> 44:06.800
Your dad has constructed the perfect trap because P playing piano isn't I think it's even like

44:07.600 --> 44:15.040
There's something implicit when you're playing guitar for somebody that is an act of courage because while you're playing guitar

44:15.520 --> 44:18.960
You're almost certainly going to be staring the person dead in the face

44:18.960 --> 44:23.800
That is like a cruel thing you're doing to the person because it forces them to react to your show

44:24.440 --> 44:29.180
Piano I think there's something implicit that where if people don't like it

44:29.180 --> 44:33.580
You don't see it until you turn around. Yeah, sure more of a betrayal

44:34.380 --> 44:37.940
But they were always like almost by definition laughing behind your back

44:37.940 --> 44:44.140
I think you know it's it's pretty late in the year now, and I think something we may have all forgotten

44:45.180 --> 44:51.580
Is that it's 20 griff teen oh my god? It's been six months since we've said those words and here's the plan

44:52.220 --> 44:56.460
One day while your dad's playing piano you're going to say you know it sounds a lot of tune

44:56.460 --> 45:00.540
And he's gonna go what really there's like yeah, I I don't know it's a sound that we need to get a piano tuner in

45:00.540 --> 45:06.540
Here, but here's the thing you and the piano tuner in cahoots the piano tuner comes in and says oh, yeah

45:06.540 --> 45:10.420
This is like dangerously worn wire if you keep playing this it could

45:11.140 --> 45:17.940
Explode or whatever the equivalent of a piano breaking now pianos can explode definitely sure to know because they're under a lot of high

45:18.020 --> 45:20.220
Tension tune them too tight it tears of tears

45:20.220 --> 45:27.380
And he says I can't tune this and I also can't allow you to keep playing it my creed as a piano tuner

45:27.700 --> 45:31.980
Doesn't allow me to leave this dangerous object here. We're going to have to take it away problem

45:31.980 --> 45:38.620
Problem is as soon as he says that dr. Strings pops in it's like I got it. Oh god damn it dr. Strings not again

45:39.060 --> 45:45.980
Dr.. Strings, I'm trying to hold on dr. Strings. Can you come over here? Yeah sure what's this? What's crack-a-lacking dr. Strings listen?

45:45.980 --> 45:50.820
Can you fucking can you fucking lock it down for a fucking second dr. Strings and trying to grift my dad?

45:50.820 --> 45:56.860
I'd love to but you know my jam. I follow around other piano tuners and try to give a better rate

45:57.660 --> 46:00.140
dr. Strings needs to get his be quiet I

46:01.380 --> 46:06.020
Oh, it's the old get rid of the piano from the emotionally sensitive dad scam. I'm into it

46:07.740 --> 46:09.740
$30 into my help is yours

46:09.740 --> 46:14.540
I can't do anything about that their key box, but I can do something about that daddy

46:14.540 --> 46:18.960
What are you saying? Dr. Strings? No, just watch me go dr.

46:18.960 --> 46:25.980
She's huge looking the life out of my father. I'm tuning him. No, you're killing him. Please. You're killing you stop

46:25.980 --> 46:27.980
I'm your daddy now

46:28.700 --> 46:30.700
Please

46:31.780 --> 46:33.780
Let you out of that lamp

46:33.780 --> 46:42.260
Oh fuck doctors who's gonna take this body away. Hey

46:44.340 --> 46:46.900
Dr. Barney, you got a body here. Oh

46:47.500 --> 46:49.300
the old bad

46:49.300 --> 46:57.180
Piano sensitive dad called dr. Strings. I get it. I'm there with you another body. Dr. Strings someday. I'm gonna get here before you

46:57.180 --> 46:59.180
Hey

47:01.620 --> 47:05.300
You need the piano tune I'm trying to pick up some extra cash

47:07.740 --> 47:09.740
That was terrifying

47:10.380 --> 47:17.220
Dr. Strings. I really enjoyed the doctor strings character and killed that guy's dad. Yeah

47:18.060 --> 47:19.740
Yeah, that was rough

47:19.740 --> 47:25.340
That was a bad break for dr. Strings. Um, here's another guy next no read the next

47:25.340 --> 47:27.700
I really like the next one and I want Justin to react to it

47:27.700 --> 47:28.060
Okay

47:28.060 --> 47:36.180
I just knocked my roommate's toothbrushes off the sink and into what can only be described as a hellish hellish garbage. That's a good priorities

47:36.180 --> 47:38.180
Oh my god. No, I have to email the brothers

47:39.340 --> 47:42.580
What can I do no toothbrush cover thing no nothing just

47:43.220 --> 47:48.900
Virgin bristles and to make it work. Does anybody use toothbrush covers? Is that a thing? No god

47:48.900 --> 47:51.980
I'm gonna put a little helmet on him

47:52.620 --> 47:55.380
It seems like that would be a breeding ground for bacteria. Anyway, yeah

47:55.380 --> 48:02.140
Absolutely make it worse moments before I ran the vacuum cleaner over his phone charger and basically shredded that thing like sharp cheddar

48:02.260 --> 48:06.780
Now I find myself in a quandary do I come clean on either of these misdemeanors?

48:06.820 --> 48:11.900
The charger is probably necessary to reimburse or some shit. But how about the toothbrush?

48:12.580 --> 48:14.940
SOS that's from toothbrushless in

48:14.940 --> 48:18.220
Tejas um

48:19.060 --> 48:21.520
You guys remember that season or I think it was real world

48:22.020 --> 48:27.300
Where somebody was acting a fool and so they took that person's toothbrush and they scrubbed the toilet with it

48:27.300 --> 48:33.300
And it's like the only time I've ever seen in a reality show like a producer came in was that hey straight up

48:35.820 --> 48:40.940
You can't use that toothbrush because it got it got pretty it got kind of gnarly

48:40.940 --> 48:47.740
Can you believe that that actually I don't normally intercede here in today's in today's reality show market

48:47.740 --> 48:50.660
They would just like film it like yeah, let's see it. Yeah, let's see

48:51.140 --> 48:56.340
See him put that poop. Let's see him get like all kinds of disease. I want to see him get poopy mouth

48:56.340 --> 48:59.620
They probably edit in some funny sound effects like well, it's time to brush my teeth

49:00.500 --> 49:05.320
Yeah, like a heart. Ah, here's what you do. This is a really easy one. Okay

49:05.320 --> 49:11.680
Right now you have a problem because you have done two bad things. That's not good. That's not great

49:11.680 --> 49:15.680
Here's one bad things an accident to seems definitely a malicious intent

49:15.760 --> 49:22.600
Here's what you need to do. You need to get into your house and mess up everything. You can't overturn the tables up in the middle

49:23.320 --> 49:26.320
Take the flowers out of the pot and throw them on the ground

49:26.320 --> 49:31.520
Blow the piano explode the piano and then do you know his dad and then kill sad and then you know

49:31.520 --> 49:36.600
What you do you go and you get Marmaduke and you get Marmaduke in the house

49:36.920 --> 49:44.120
So when he shows up, you're just like have your hands in your head like Marmaduke. No stop and you get just all the Duke

49:44.120 --> 49:50.200
That's all of that. You also just put the toothbrush back and don't tell him. Yeah, you put the toothbrush back wait

49:50.200 --> 49:57.520
Okay, yes some three. Can I just three inconsistencies? There's no inconsistencies with the Marmaduke. No, I've got three off the top of my lid

49:57.520 --> 50:04.400
Okay, got it. Number one. Okay, how did Marmaduke put the toothbrush back?

50:04.400 --> 50:08.920
I get him knocking it off but for him to put it back that was an insane thing that Travis said that's

50:09.760 --> 50:12.920
Any sense? Okay, number two, okay

50:14.720 --> 50:17.360
How he ran the vacuum cleaner

50:18.700 --> 50:22.400
He thinks these people and I know I know I know I know what he thinks

50:22.400 --> 50:27.760
But like if the roommate was running the vacuum cleaner and Marmaduke was like, hey, I'll put this cord in there

50:28.160 --> 50:34.220
And then he just sucked the cord. Okay. I've well now I've got another fucking inconsistency because Marmaduke definitely didn't speak you

50:35.280 --> 50:39.360
Do you honestly fucking think that if you get home and to find that?

50:39.840 --> 50:46.280
Marmaduke has like up ended your whole existence. You're gonna kill Perot the individual clues. It doesn't make any sense

50:46.280 --> 50:52.800
Justin not right away. It's not right away, but there will it will burn in his brain and two years later

50:52.800 --> 50:58.860
Like hey, do you remember when Marmaduke was in our apartment and like trash? How did he run the vacuum?

50:59.440 --> 51:05.200
And I also at some point shouldn't we get separate bedrooms? This seems weird to me. Well, good night

51:06.800 --> 51:08.800
Number four

51:09.160 --> 51:11.240
Just wrecking shit wasn't Marmaduke's thing

51:11.240 --> 51:15.960
He thought he was people and he was like a silly boy and he would like sit on the couch like look at me

51:15.960 --> 51:20.520
I'm a big silly man. He thought he was people but he wasn't Dennis a fucking menace

51:20.520 --> 51:25.560
He wasn't a Tasmanian devil, you know what it had been better is Beethoven more

51:26.520 --> 51:33.720
Palatable me. I was thinking of Beethoven. You were thinking of Beethoven that whole time. We try again. Okay. Okay. See here's what you do

51:34.640 --> 51:40.920
Right now your problem is you only have two things that are messed up. Uh-huh. Two things. It's intentional

51:40.920 --> 51:47.640
Yeah, two things. It's intentional. But what you're gonna need to do is ruin everything in your house, right like

51:48.520 --> 51:51.780
Flip your TV over. Oh, and then go get Beethoven

51:57.240 --> 51:59.240
I've been poached

52:00.520 --> 52:05.880
Griffin edited out the first one and now there's just this one and my movement has it's gone

52:05.880 --> 52:09.580
I've been choked poached

52:10.320 --> 52:12.320
Travis is gonna register that

52:13.520 --> 52:17.900
Tomorrow on the max foot store you're gonna have and then you get Beethoven t-shirts

52:18.000 --> 52:22.860
It's gonna have Travis's face coming out of it. Try to a bitch on the front page of the Financial Times now Travis

52:22.860 --> 52:26.600
How did you make your billions? Well, it was my uh-oh Beethoven. What'd you do shirts?

52:26.860 --> 52:33.080
So hold on wait, you made license shirts based on the dog movie franchise Beethoven and they didn't know nobody came for it

52:33.080 --> 52:34.760
I don't know

52:34.760 --> 52:41.520
It was weird now that I've seen rumors online that your brother Justin was a these rumors are false and libelous and scandalous

52:41.520 --> 52:43.520
I no longer speak to my brother

52:45.000 --> 52:49.840
We do still do the show you do the show yes, but this is we just never directly address each other

52:49.840 --> 52:52.840
It's right. It's the two of us talking to Griffin. That's you know, it's funny

52:52.840 --> 52:58.080
If you look back over all the episodes Justin and Travis never actually speak to each other. It's true draft

52:59.200 --> 53:01.200
Wait, oh shit

53:01.200 --> 53:07.520
Broke let's it in the in let's end the program. God nothing to make me happier than that. I'm feeling good

53:07.520 --> 53:13.880
I'm sitting the last like episode that the three of us did we were so fucking down in the dumps tired

53:14.160 --> 53:18.440
At the congo from LA pop fest. I this is a 180 degree turn out

53:18.440 --> 53:22.400

53:23.360 --> 53:28.960
Rewarded your patience with that effort with a best of it's just like it was that weekend was fucking insane

53:28.960 --> 53:32.720
And listen, I've seen a lot of people like tweeting and asking about it

53:32.720 --> 53:35.840
Like I know the schedule has been off for like the last two months

53:36.040 --> 53:41.920
Where we've been putting up episodes like Tuesday morning and late Monday night and all that shit, but like we're getting it

53:41.920 --> 53:45.280
It's getting it back together. No. Yeah, it's not gonna be a regular thing

53:45.280 --> 53:49.520
It just is fully August and September were crazy because I feel the same way that like

53:49.960 --> 53:53.760
It's really important to me that podcasts be there like what I'm expecting them, right?

53:53.760 --> 53:58.060
Like I've got my week sort of like laid out for for how far each podcast has to carry me

53:58.060 --> 54:02.000
