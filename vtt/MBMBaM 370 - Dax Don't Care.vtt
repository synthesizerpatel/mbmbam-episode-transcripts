WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.840 --> 00:47.840
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the

00:47.840 --> 00:52.720
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.720 --> 00:56.880
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media, Luminary Griffin McElroy.

00:56.880 --> 01:05.840
Um, I have recently returned from a vacation, um, on which, uh, during which, yes, within which,

01:05.840 --> 01:12.000
I listened to, uh, three different Hercule Poirot novels.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.760
Mmm, now we- he is, of course, everyone's favorite-

01:17.760 --> 01:18.720
Belgian.

01:18.720 --> 01:21.040
Philos- Belgian philosopher.

01:21.040 --> 01:21.280
Uh-huh.

01:21.280 --> 01:26.960
I- I don't want to derail you, Travis, but being deeply into Poirot was sort of my thing.

01:26.960 --> 01:33.120
No, no, no, Justin, I- don't get it twisted. I'm not about to claim that, but I have been

01:33.120 --> 01:38.560
inspired by the Poirot novels and also, uh, Sherlock Holmes stories I've listened to.

01:38.560 --> 01:43.600
I would like to- to bring back a word, um, in its original meaning.

01:43.600 --> 01:43.920
Oh.

01:45.040 --> 01:50.800
Oh, wait, wait, wait, let me hold my breath here just to kind of brace myself for Twitter.

01:50.800 --> 01:51.360
I already said-

01:51.360 --> 01:52.080
Okay, go ahead.

01:52.080 --> 01:53.680
Ejaculated, um-

01:53.680 --> 01:55.760
Let's put it right back, and then let's put it right back in its grave.

01:55.760 --> 02:01.440
They use it a lot in the books to say, like, my God, I ejaculated, and-

02:01.440 --> 02:01.760
Okay.

02:02.880 --> 02:07.200
Um, I- I think that I would like to bring that back, so, like, if I was telling a story and I

02:07.200 --> 02:13.200
said, like, I was walking down the street and I saw my friend, hey, Todd, I ejaculated.

02:13.200 --> 02:13.520
Yeah, so-

02:13.520 --> 02:15.120
Yeah, I love that.

02:15.120 --> 02:21.600
This is not a critic podcast. We've never- we've never been critical of one thing this entire time

02:21.600 --> 02:27.600
except juggling- the juggling arts, and I don't know that we possess the critical faculties

02:27.600 --> 02:34.160
required to sort of dissect the original artist intent, and so if it's like Sherlock Holmes

02:35.600 --> 02:42.480
shouted, get back here with my- with my soup, Dr. Watson, he ejaculated.

02:42.480 --> 02:46.000
How are we to know that he wasn't coming while he was, like,

02:46.000 --> 02:49.120
trying to get his soup back from that squirrely Dr. Watson?

02:49.120 --> 02:52.640
I leaned out the window. I ejaculated. Get back here.

02:52.640 --> 02:58.160
Yeah, maybe it was Sherlock Holmes is just nasty just blasting one out the windows of 221B Baker

02:58.160 --> 02:59.920
Street. Maybe it's to say.

02:59.920 --> 03:04.640
I would like you both to try. Maybe tell a story and try to use it within the story.

03:05.280 --> 03:05.600
Okay.

03:06.320 --> 03:06.640
Okay.

03:08.240 --> 03:09.840
Do you have one, Griffin? You're a starter.

03:09.840 --> 03:17.680
Yeah, sure. Watch this really hot stuff, and then you heard, I ejaculated. I ejaculated.

03:17.680 --> 03:19.040
That's pretty good.

03:19.040 --> 03:22.080
That was really good. Okay, here's my story.

03:22.080 --> 03:25.520
One day, my dumb middle brother tried to make ejaculated a thing.

03:26.480 --> 03:30.560
Several days before that, I was at Margaritaville.

03:30.560 --> 03:34.000
See, this is what I thought- this is what I wanted the introduction to be.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.440
I thought we were going to have a deep Margaritaville exploration.

03:35.440 --> 03:37.440
Work it in naturally. Work it in.

03:37.440 --> 03:38.720
No, I did- I already worked it in.

03:38.720 --> 03:41.840
Just ejaculate it right into the podcast.

03:41.840 --> 03:45.040
Right. My brother tried to make the word ejaculated come back.

03:45.040 --> 03:47.120
Come back. Nice.

03:47.120 --> 03:48.080
It's a comeback.

03:49.920 --> 03:53.760
God. God, we're all dads. We're all adults.

03:53.760 --> 03:58.480
I want to talk about Margaritaville, but I do want to say another weird quirk of language

03:58.480 --> 04:03.360
in Agatha Christie books is that she will often say a minute or two when I have to assume she

04:03.360 --> 04:06.640
means a moment or two because there's a lot of instances of people being like,

04:06.640 --> 04:10.400
so, uh, in any way, Poro, that's how my dad died.

04:10.400 --> 04:14.400
And it said, and Poro pause for a minute or two and then reply.

04:14.400 --> 04:17.760
That would be so fucking crazy to think about Poro just like,

04:17.760 --> 04:19.760
barreling them for two minutes straight.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.640
Just like, uh huh.

04:22.160 --> 04:24.880
So he's the character, not the author.

04:25.680 --> 04:29.760
She also refers to mustaches as individual mustaches.

04:29.760 --> 04:32.080
Like these are my mustaches. They're very luxuriant.

04:32.080 --> 04:37.440
Um, so Justin, how's, how's James?

04:38.080 --> 04:40.800
So I rolled up, this is true.

04:40.800 --> 04:46.720
The exact same back on Myrtle beach, exact same, uh, Margaritaville.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.320
That brought me so much torment.

04:48.320 --> 04:49.920
The pilgrimage.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.400
Got back there.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.960
Good news. It's a little bit more off season.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.200
Little bit rainy.

04:57.200 --> 05:02.640
Still had to wait 35 stone cold minutes to get into JB's place.

05:02.640 --> 05:05.760
You would think I'd get on some sort of preferential treatment list,

05:05.760 --> 05:08.080
but there was no Joe's Crab Shack for me this time.

05:08.080 --> 05:11.760
We went straight there and then just went to the beef jerky store

05:11.760 --> 05:14.000
and the wine store that's right across the street.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.560
Had a wine slushie. It was delicious.

05:16.560 --> 05:19.360
Oh, I was with Justin. I should make that clear.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.800
Travis was with me.

05:20.800 --> 05:24.960
Uh, so we go in, we finally get the thumbs up.

05:24.960 --> 05:27.360
Come on in J-Man, the water's fine.

05:28.080 --> 05:33.280
And here it was more amazing than I, okay.

05:33.280 --> 05:36.000
So when you first walk in, here's what I literally saw

05:36.640 --> 05:40.400
when I first walked into Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville.

05:40.960 --> 05:46.560
A giant, her like tornado cyclonic cloud.

05:46.560 --> 05:50.880
And when I say giant, I mean like 20 feet across,

05:50.880 --> 05:56.800
huge sculpture of a cyclonic cloud with like flip flops

05:56.800 --> 06:00.800
and shark fins emanating from it, spinning wildly.

06:00.800 --> 06:02.080
I'm scared. I'm scared of this.

06:03.520 --> 06:04.240
It's a scary vision.

06:04.240 --> 06:07.280
That does not put me in a chill head space for this restaurant.

06:09.280 --> 06:14.400
As an upended bottle of a giant upended bottle

06:14.400 --> 06:26.240
of a Margaritaville brand tequila dumped into a 15 foot tall blender

06:27.680 --> 06:32.080
while a woman clad all in pink and on stilts

06:32.880 --> 06:37.440
humped the blender as she shouted, I love margaritas.

06:37.440 --> 06:38.160
Whoa.

06:38.160 --> 06:43.920
As the song Margaritaville played and the cyclonic cloud spun and-

06:43.920 --> 06:44.320
Jesus.

06:44.320 --> 06:47.760
There was a fake weather report about a hurricane party

06:47.760 --> 06:49.920
headed from Myrtle Beach that I thought was in poor taste.

06:49.920 --> 06:50.560
Yeah, really poor taste maybe a bit.

06:50.560 --> 06:52.560
But I'm assuming it's pre-programmed.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.680
Was this a real woman or a statue of a woman?

06:55.680 --> 06:56.400
No, it's a real woman.

06:56.400 --> 07:00.160
No, this is a real woman who's doing some balloon animals for the kids.

07:00.720 --> 07:06.000
She took breaks from humping the giant blender to make balloon animals for the kids.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.600
The blender sex acts are for adults only.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.600
Now, Griffin, I texted you a picture of this happening,

07:11.600 --> 07:13.920
so I know that you know I'm not lying about it.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.120
You texted me some pictures?

07:15.120 --> 07:18.240
I don't think that I, I guess, digested them enough.

07:18.240 --> 07:20.400
I guess I didn't really pour over them.

07:21.280 --> 07:23.040
There's a lot visually to-

07:23.040 --> 07:24.880
Wow, heck, you're not joking.

07:25.520 --> 07:25.760
There she is.

07:25.760 --> 07:27.040
Yeah, there's a woman on-

07:27.040 --> 07:29.120
Yeah, it's true.

07:29.120 --> 07:30.960
I'll put that on social media or something.

07:30.960 --> 07:33.040
Kind of took a break off the social media.

07:35.360 --> 07:39.120
Did get a huge drink called a five o'clock somewhere

07:39.120 --> 07:43.760
that tasted like turpentine and raspberries in a blender cup

07:43.760 --> 07:46.560
that I brought home with me to savor the experience.

07:49.840 --> 07:53.120
It was raining so bad after we left the restaurant

07:53.120 --> 07:55.280
that I had to go back into the gift shop

07:55.280 --> 07:58.240
and buy a $27 Margaritaville branded umbrella.

07:59.280 --> 08:00.000
How'd that hold up?

08:00.000 --> 08:00.560
Both.

08:00.560 --> 08:02.000
How'd that protect you from the elements?

08:03.440 --> 08:04.000
It was fine.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.640
Travis and I had to huddle underneath one Margaritaville brand umbrella

08:08.640 --> 08:11.280
as we made our way back to our car to pick up our families.

08:13.200 --> 08:16.080
A lot of weird tunes that weren't necessarily Jay.

08:16.080 --> 08:20.400
You think, you would think it would be all Jimmy Buffett music all the time.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.240
And then a couple of people at our table remarked that like,

08:22.240 --> 08:24.800
hey, they aren't playing Jimmy Buffett music constantly.

08:24.800 --> 08:25.760
Why do you think that is?

08:25.760 --> 08:27.600
And my assumption is that people work there

08:27.600 --> 08:28.800
and they don't want to go insane.

08:30.960 --> 08:34.560
I would assume at the beginning it was all Jay music

08:34.560 --> 08:37.520
and they just went like clinically chill.

08:37.520 --> 08:41.840
Like almost terminally chill would be my fear there.

08:41.840 --> 08:44.720
So there was some Kenny Chesney in the mix.

08:44.720 --> 08:48.960
I think some LaBouche, which was an odd choice.

08:50.320 --> 08:53.200
Anyway, all the food was great.

08:55.280 --> 08:56.960
You paid a premium price for it.

08:58.640 --> 09:02.560
The waiter was chipper and very business-like.

09:02.560 --> 09:05.840
Not very chill, I thought, but that's fine

09:05.840 --> 09:08.160
because your speed is of the essence

09:08.160 --> 09:10.480
when I'm waiting for my five o'clock somewhere

09:10.480 --> 09:11.520
to be delivered to the table.

09:12.800 --> 09:15.760
But it was everything I could have hoped for.

09:16.320 --> 09:19.280
JB didn't come out of the...

09:19.280 --> 09:20.800
That we know of.

09:20.800 --> 09:23.920
Well, he's busy in the kitchen cooking up all the bad food.

09:24.720 --> 09:25.200
He was.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.000
The food was great.

09:26.720 --> 09:27.920
Food was great.

09:27.920 --> 09:32.240
And I'm assuming one of his disguises he was employing

09:32.240 --> 09:34.400
because he likes to watch people really enjoy.

09:34.400 --> 09:38.080
Now, I did find an old man wearing a large hat

09:38.080 --> 09:41.200
that I told my daughter Charlie was Jimmy Buffett,

09:41.200 --> 09:44.080
which she then loudly started pointing at him

09:44.080 --> 09:46.080
and telling everyone at the table who would listen

09:46.080 --> 09:48.960
that there was Jimmy Buffett, that she had found him.

09:48.960 --> 09:51.440
I don't know if he noticed this fun prank

09:51.440 --> 09:53.440
that I played on this elderly gentleman.

09:55.120 --> 10:00.000
I would say that, yes, Margaritaville was a highlight.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.080
We also had another dining experience

10:02.080 --> 10:05.520
at a local eatery known as Pirate's Voyage.

10:06.800 --> 10:07.520
Yes.

10:07.520 --> 10:09.760
And I realized two things.

10:09.760 --> 10:13.920
One, it was an incredible show with stunts, thrills, chills.

10:14.560 --> 10:17.520
And original music by Dolly Parton.

10:17.520 --> 10:18.080
Wait, what?

10:18.960 --> 10:19.680
Yes.

10:19.680 --> 10:20.560
You heard me.

10:20.560 --> 10:24.160
She did the OST for this pirate themed restaurant?

10:24.160 --> 10:24.480
Correct.

10:24.480 --> 10:26.240
It's all Dolly.

10:26.240 --> 10:30.720
There was a spooky scary number

10:30.720 --> 10:33.280
with a giant animatronic Davy Jones

10:33.280 --> 10:34.960
that scared the shit out of my baby.

10:36.960 --> 10:39.840
But most of it she was down with.

10:39.840 --> 10:43.680
But I realized that there is a small infinitesimal chance

10:43.680 --> 10:47.600
that one of the performers at Pirate's Voyage

10:47.600 --> 10:49.520
might listen to My Brother, My Brother, Me.

10:49.520 --> 10:51.280
And if that is true, I wanna say,

10:51.280 --> 10:54.000
if you're listening to this, it was incredible.

10:54.000 --> 10:54.720
Yeah, great job.

10:54.720 --> 10:55.520
It was great.

10:55.520 --> 10:59.360
They bring the food out to you pirate style,

10:59.360 --> 11:00.480
which I didn't know what that meant.

11:00.480 --> 11:01.840
What's that mean, Justin?

11:01.840 --> 11:02.800
So here are some of the items that-

11:02.800 --> 11:05.120
They steal it, they take it back from you by force

11:05.120 --> 11:06.000
as soon as they give it.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.720
I'm reciting the menu from,

11:08.720 --> 11:10.400
like the entirety of the menu from memory.

11:11.600 --> 11:14.080
It started with a Voyager vegetable soup,

11:14.080 --> 11:16.320
which they sell a mix for in the gift shop

11:16.320 --> 11:19.120
if you would like to get some Voyager vegetable soup.

11:19.120 --> 11:22.560
And that was served with a buccaneer bread.

11:23.360 --> 11:23.680
All right.

11:23.680 --> 11:26.480
And the bowl that they had,

11:26.480 --> 11:28.400
they brought you the bowl for soup,

11:28.400 --> 11:31.200
but there was no spoon available.

11:31.200 --> 11:34.000
And my father-in-law didn't,

11:34.000 --> 11:35.600
just like left it in front of him

11:35.600 --> 11:36.400
because he couldn't,

11:36.400 --> 11:38.480
he just didn't know what he was supposed to do.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.000
What they expect you to do is drink it,

11:40.800 --> 11:42.800
like mug like, like a pirate.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.560
But he refused to deign to their wishes.

11:44.560 --> 11:46.800
So he just left his Voyager vegetable soup.

11:47.520 --> 11:50.400
As a gentleman who's played Captain Hook

11:50.400 --> 11:54.320
in several permutations of Peter Pan musicals in Huntington,

11:54.320 --> 11:56.880
I'm very disappointed in Tommy's failure

11:56.880 --> 11:58.080
to commit to the bit here.

11:58.880 --> 12:03.920
They then brought out the half a roasted cackler,

12:03.920 --> 12:06.240
which yes, was chicken.

12:06.240 --> 12:07.520
That is chicken.

12:07.520 --> 12:08.400
That one's chicken.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.400
You're killing me Pirates Voyage.

12:10.960 --> 12:17.520
And there was a captain's BBQ roast,

12:17.520 --> 12:19.040
which is just pulled pork.

12:19.040 --> 12:21.840
Then they brought out the pirate herb-based potato,

12:21.840 --> 12:23.440
which I think was just,

12:23.440 --> 12:24.960
they just put pirate on there.

12:24.960 --> 12:26.800
I couldn't think of a way to say the best one,

12:26.800 --> 12:27.760
Justin, say the best one.

12:27.760 --> 12:30.320
Oh, they brought out a Cabo buttery,

12:30.320 --> 12:31.520
which is what they call corn.

12:34.800 --> 12:35.200
All right.

12:35.760 --> 12:37.280
Well, it sounds like you guys had fun.

12:37.280 --> 12:38.720
Cabo buttery and some apple oh my,

12:38.720 --> 12:42.080
some apple oh my eye pie, the Cabo buttery.

12:42.080 --> 12:44.640
And they brought it out in like secession.

12:44.640 --> 12:48.640
So like first they brought out the potato

12:48.640 --> 12:50.240
and that one was just there.

12:50.240 --> 12:53.200
And then they brought out the chicken like two minutes after.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.800
And I was into the impression that I didn't know

12:54.800 --> 12:56.560
if I was supposed to be keeping pace.

12:56.560 --> 12:58.080
Like if I should be eating the,

12:58.080 --> 13:00.400
like the potato better be gone by the time they get back.

13:01.920 --> 13:03.840
The last thing I wanted to say is as we were leaving,

13:03.840 --> 13:07.120
there was a sign for another Dolly Parton similar thing.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.760
This was like red pirates versus blue pirates.

13:09.760 --> 13:13.120
That was actually the Crimson versus Sapphire crews.

13:13.120 --> 13:15.600
They had to battle each other for supremacy.

13:15.600 --> 13:19.440
As we were leaving, we saw a sign for Dolly Parton's Dixie Stampede,

13:19.440 --> 13:22.160
which is a similar thing, but cowboy themed.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.880
And you have to sit on one side of the restaurant or the other

13:24.880 --> 13:26.560
to root for the north or the south.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.720
I bet that's an awkward hang right now, eh?

13:28.720 --> 13:29.760
Yeah, that's not a good hang.

13:30.400 --> 13:32.960
I might argue that that's never been a good hang.

13:32.960 --> 13:33.840
Yeah, Dolly.

13:35.680 --> 13:37.360
I hope you all, it sounds like you had a lot of fun

13:37.360 --> 13:38.320
on your beach adventure.

13:38.320 --> 13:43.760
I had a lot of fun here down in Austin where my son got pink eye.

13:43.760 --> 13:47.280
And also I got in an on-box style group fight

13:47.280 --> 13:49.760
for two gallons of diesel gasoline.

13:49.760 --> 13:52.320
So we've been having a lot of fun down here in Austin,

13:52.320 --> 13:53.920
fight for gasoline, get pink eye.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.840
I'm sorry about it.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.040
I missed everything, Griffin.

13:57.040 --> 13:58.720
I wasn't able to emotionally support you.

13:58.720 --> 13:59.440
No, it's fine.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.600
I wasn't able to emotionally support you

14:01.600 --> 14:05.040
when you went to these themed restaurants.

14:05.040 --> 14:06.720
I wish I could have been there for you through that.

14:07.520 --> 14:09.600
And of course, though I should have mentioned it before,

14:09.600 --> 14:11.440
we talked about the pirate restaurant we went to.

14:11.440 --> 14:15.040
Our thoughts are with everybody who's affected by the hurricane.

14:15.040 --> 14:19.440
I don't know if anybody listening was affected by that.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.840
I have to assume at least tangentially some people were.

14:21.840 --> 14:23.920
Yeah, absolutely some folks were.

14:23.920 --> 14:26.320
And best of luck.

14:26.320 --> 14:29.680
And we hope you all can, you know, Texas is tough.

14:30.240 --> 14:32.000
And Griffin has taught me that.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.440
Oh, we've been seeing lots of that from certain Texas politicians

14:35.440 --> 14:37.120
like we're going to get that hurricane.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.480
You're not going to get the hurricane.

14:38.480 --> 14:40.480
Like we're going to be cool and stuff.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.440
And we're going to like help each other rebuild

14:43.440 --> 14:44.640
and support each other or whatever.

14:44.640 --> 14:45.840
But you can't fucking kill.

14:45.840 --> 14:48.400
You understand that I can't go buy the biggest gun at Walmart

14:48.400 --> 14:49.520
and shoot the hurricane.

14:49.520 --> 14:50.640
And then the hurricane's like,

14:51.840 --> 14:55.120
like literally every Texas like conservative bill.

14:55.120 --> 14:55.840
You can do it.

14:55.840 --> 14:57.120
Wrestle that hurricane.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.720
Don't mess with Texas hurricane.

14:58.720 --> 15:01.280
You can't, the hurricane's not messing with Texas.

15:01.280 --> 15:03.440
It's just doing what hurricanes do.

15:03.440 --> 15:05.760
You can't go buy a fucking big, big gun

15:05.760 --> 15:07.520
and shoot it into the heart of the hurricane

15:07.520 --> 15:08.560
and the hurricane dissipates.

15:08.560 --> 15:10.800
And you're like, oh, Teddy, Teddy got him.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.640
Did you try, did you try?

15:12.640 --> 15:14.320
No, I didn't really get up to Austin enough

15:14.320 --> 15:16.800
for me to really get at the, you know, the heart of the thing.

15:16.800 --> 15:20.800
The blender at the heart of this, this Jimmy Buffett hurricane.

15:20.800 --> 15:24.800
But they should probably have a different fake news feed

15:24.800 --> 15:29.200
to play during the, the Margarita explosion.

15:29.200 --> 15:32.080
Like it would, I'm assuming that that has probably occurred

15:32.080 --> 15:34.720
to them that like sometimes parts of America

15:34.720 --> 15:36.720
and you know what other countries,

15:36.720 --> 15:39.920
as long as we're talking about it, Jimmy's an international star

15:39.920 --> 15:42.080
are being ravaged by hurricanes.

15:42.080 --> 15:44.880
So maybe the fake hurricane party is not always

15:44.880 --> 15:47.280
so great all the time.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.080
Should we get to the meat of the matter?

15:50.880 --> 15:53.120
I believe that's in order, Griffin.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.120
This is an advice show where we take your questions

15:55.120 --> 15:58.400
and turn them alchemy like into wisdom.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.960
And we're gonna start right now.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.040
I'm ready to go, I ejaculated.

16:03.040 --> 16:03.520
Oh, boy.

16:03.520 --> 16:04.020
Okay.

16:04.020 --> 16:07.220
My best friend in the world moved away a little while ago.

16:07.220 --> 16:09.380
Start over, you said my breast friend, Justin.

16:09.380 --> 16:11.060
We can't, we talked about ejaculation

16:11.060 --> 16:12.180
for the first six minutes of the show.

16:12.180 --> 16:13.140
I didn't.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.820
We stopped in Winston-Salem on the way back.

16:14.820 --> 16:17.460
There was a theme restaurant called Twin Peaks

16:17.460 --> 16:20.020
and I was so excited until I found out

16:20.020 --> 16:21.540
what the Twin Peaks was referencing

16:22.100 --> 16:24.980
and it was not a good scene for me.

16:25.540 --> 16:26.740
It was a restaurant.

16:26.740 --> 16:28.100
Shall we say, oh, okay.

16:29.300 --> 16:30.420
Just gonna dive right into it.

16:30.420 --> 16:31.620
Justin just ejaculated that.

16:31.620 --> 16:32.580
Please say this question.

16:32.580 --> 16:34.020
I just ejaculated that.

16:34.020 --> 16:37.460
My best friend in the world moved away a little while ago.

16:37.460 --> 16:39.940
A few weeks before he left, he offered me his bike

16:40.500 --> 16:42.180
that he said he didn't want anymore

16:42.180 --> 16:44.500
and didn't want to spend time and money moving.

16:45.060 --> 16:47.220
I gladly took the, that's just lazy, by the way,

16:47.220 --> 16:48.180
because you could ride it.

16:48.180 --> 16:49.780
I gladly took the bike.

16:49.780 --> 16:52.020
A few days before his going away party,

16:52.020 --> 16:54.500
his wife asked me to bring the bike back

16:54.500 --> 16:55.380
so they could pack it.

16:56.660 --> 16:58.980
When I asked my friend what the deal was,

16:58.980 --> 17:00.420
I thought he gave me the bike.

17:00.420 --> 17:01.700
He said, don't worry about it

17:01.700 --> 17:04.180
and don't mention it again and I can keep the bike.

17:05.300 --> 17:07.540
The bike wasn't brought up again until recently

17:07.540 --> 17:10.020
after they had already moved halfway across the country

17:10.020 --> 17:11.700
when his wife texted me asking

17:11.700 --> 17:13.460
when I was going to send them the bike.

17:13.460 --> 17:13.940
Come on.

17:14.820 --> 17:16.820
I told them my friend was sending the bike back,

17:16.820 --> 17:19.060
but he keeps insisting I don't.

17:19.060 --> 17:20.740
His wife seems very annoyed

17:20.740 --> 17:22.420
and I have no idea what to do.

17:22.420 --> 17:23.220
Please help.

17:23.220 --> 17:25.140
That's from potential bike thief.

17:25.140 --> 17:25.780
Woof.

17:25.780 --> 17:27.140
How do you send a bike?

17:27.700 --> 17:30.100
You go roll up, you fucking ride it to FedEx

17:30.100 --> 17:33.780
and you're like, do you have a big box for this?

17:33.780 --> 17:36.020
And also I need cab fare for the ride home.

17:36.900 --> 17:37.700
What the fuck?

17:37.700 --> 17:40.660
I'm just gonna force dump this across the country

17:40.660 --> 17:42.580
and lead a revolution of people

17:42.580 --> 17:45.860
who are inspired by my insistence

17:45.860 --> 17:47.780
on pedaling a bike across the nation.

17:47.780 --> 17:50.500
This bike life movement is gonna be so disappointed

17:50.500 --> 17:51.860
also when you get there and you're like,

17:51.860 --> 17:53.780
I'm done because it's not mine.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.060
I have a theory as to what's going on here.

17:57.700 --> 17:58.260
Okay.

17:58.260 --> 18:00.260
Let me know what you guys think.

18:00.260 --> 18:04.660
I think that best friend wants a new bike

18:04.660 --> 18:07.060
and doesn't wanna move the old bike across the country.

18:07.860 --> 18:12.820
But best friend's wife thinks that old bike is still fine,

18:12.820 --> 18:13.140
right?

18:13.140 --> 18:15.140
And doesn't see the need for new bike.

18:15.140 --> 18:19.140
So best friend tells wife loaned it to question asker.

18:19.140 --> 18:19.940
Oh God.

18:21.140 --> 18:23.780
And then the plan was once they had moved me like,

18:23.780 --> 18:26.740
oh, we didn't get it back from question asker.

18:26.740 --> 18:28.420
Ah, beans, you're caught up in that.

18:28.420 --> 18:29.540
Guess I gotta get a new bike.

18:30.260 --> 18:32.820
You're embroiled in something so much bigger

18:32.820 --> 18:34.100
than this bike though.

18:34.100 --> 18:38.340
Cause there's some scandal level deception happening

18:38.340 --> 18:39.380
in this couple.

18:39.380 --> 18:41.700
And what Mr. and Mrs. Agent Smith,

18:41.700 --> 18:44.100
what are they not saying to each other?

18:44.100 --> 18:46.340
Are they gonna get in a big knife fight in the kitchen

18:46.340 --> 18:48.260
when their identities are revealed over this bike?

18:48.260 --> 18:50.980
You've got a tiny little liars scenario here.

18:50.980 --> 18:53.300
You've got a baby liars situation on your head.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.420
Itty bitty liars.

18:54.420 --> 18:58.580
If you are in the middle of two people

18:58.580 --> 19:00.340
and they're telling you to do different things

19:00.900 --> 19:01.940
and one of the people,

19:02.820 --> 19:04.020
if you don't do the thing,

19:05.220 --> 19:06.180
you'll be a thief.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.980
You should probably defer to that one.

19:08.980 --> 19:10.580
That's the one that I would-

19:10.580 --> 19:12.020
If you have two options,

19:12.020 --> 19:15.380
and one of the options is you get a sick cool new Huffy

19:15.380 --> 19:16.900
that you can take behind the Kroger

19:16.900 --> 19:19.220
and go up the big dumpster ramp.

19:19.220 --> 19:20.260
I think that might be,

19:20.260 --> 19:22.260
that's the cool Huffy option.

19:22.260 --> 19:23.380
And I want that one.

19:23.380 --> 19:24.740
Can we make that one work?

19:24.740 --> 19:27.620
Can the Huffy stay in the picture?

19:27.620 --> 19:29.060
Yeah, but the thing is,

19:29.860 --> 19:31.620
whenever you visit your friends,

19:32.420 --> 19:33.460
Dylan and Vicky,

19:35.460 --> 19:36.420
Dylan's gonna be like,

19:36.980 --> 19:37.860
hey bud,

19:37.860 --> 19:39.140
Vicky's gonna be like,

19:39.140 --> 19:39.860
you're a thief,

19:39.860 --> 19:40.340
you're a bike thief.

19:40.340 --> 19:42.180
You're a fucking thief, yeah.

19:42.180 --> 19:44.260
You stole this fucking bike.

19:44.260 --> 19:45.860
Let's talk logistics.

19:45.860 --> 19:46.900
Okay, okay.

19:46.900 --> 19:48.580
The cost of shipping a bike

19:48.580 --> 19:51.700
is twice the price of buying a bike where you are.

19:51.700 --> 19:53.860
This is ship me a bike.

19:53.860 --> 19:54.900
I'm still so-

19:54.900 --> 19:55.620
What?

19:55.620 --> 19:57.380
Nobody's ever shipped anybody a bike.

19:57.380 --> 19:58.740
You can't ship a bike.

19:58.740 --> 20:01.540
It's like shipping a car.

20:01.540 --> 20:02.260
You can't do that.

20:02.260 --> 20:04.740
They gotta put them on the big truck and drive it away.

20:04.740 --> 20:06.020
What if this bike,

20:06.020 --> 20:07.380
I think we're all thinking like,

20:07.380 --> 20:10.020
maybe you bought it at the Toys R Us or the Walmart.

20:10.020 --> 20:13.140
Maybe this bike is like a sick custom job,

20:13.780 --> 20:17.620
like racing with all the accessories.

20:17.620 --> 20:19.540
A West Coast customs Huffy.

20:19.540 --> 20:23.380
Yeah, it's got like streamers

20:23.380 --> 20:27.300
and like whatever the actual adult good version

20:27.300 --> 20:30.100
of like a baseball card in the spokes

20:30.100 --> 20:31.620
and like light up wheels.

20:31.620 --> 20:32.260
It's a credit card.

20:32.260 --> 20:34.980
It's an insurance card in the spokes.

20:36.100 --> 20:37.060
And just the cushion.

20:37.060 --> 20:38.180
Yes, butt cushion.

20:39.140 --> 20:41.540
I think you've already,

20:41.540 --> 20:42.260
question asker,

20:42.260 --> 20:43.060
thank you for listening.

20:43.060 --> 20:44.740
You've already fucked up pretty bad

20:45.620 --> 20:47.540
in not dealing with this before they moved away.

20:47.540 --> 20:49.700
But at this point, let's be honest,

20:51.140 --> 20:52.820
they're living a long distance from you.

20:53.540 --> 20:54.820
You're probably not gonna maintain

20:54.820 --> 20:55.860
that relationship so well.

20:57.380 --> 20:58.980
I think you need to come clean to the wife.

20:58.980 --> 21:01.220
Just throw that little pipe bomb into the relationship.

21:02.900 --> 21:05.700
This is officially your friend's problem to deal with

21:05.700 --> 21:06.820
and not yours.

21:06.820 --> 21:07.700
The good news is,

21:07.700 --> 21:09.540
when you stir up this dookie,

21:10.100 --> 21:12.020
you got a means of exit.

21:13.300 --> 21:13.940
Hey, by the way,

21:14.740 --> 21:16.180
you've been lying to each other about the bike.

21:16.180 --> 21:19.540
See ya, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal.

21:19.540 --> 21:20.420
Don't worry about it.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.900
Maybe, ooh, let me hit you with this.

21:22.900 --> 21:24.100
We should have never taught Griffin,

21:24.100 --> 21:25.300
when we were teaching Griffin to ride a bike,

21:25.300 --> 21:26.100
we should have never taught him

21:26.100 --> 21:28.580
that he had to say pedal every time that he battled.

21:28.580 --> 21:30.740
Although I will give it to you, Griffin.

21:30.740 --> 21:33.300
I do not know how Michael Winslow style

21:33.300 --> 21:35.940
one would replicate sound of bike being pedaled away.

21:36.580 --> 21:39.380
It's like, that's right.

21:39.940 --> 21:44.580
And so maybe there's a lot of cocaine in the bike

21:44.580 --> 21:46.820
that the wife put there.

21:46.820 --> 21:49.300
Okay, okay, yeah.

21:50.260 --> 21:51.460
Everywhere, everywhere.

21:51.460 --> 21:52.660
You fucking go to fill up the tires,

21:52.660 --> 21:54.820
you overfill them, explosion,

21:54.820 --> 21:57.860
a cocaine explosion all over yourself.

21:57.860 --> 21:59.220
You pull off one of the handlebars

21:59.220 --> 22:01.220
when you take a left over that dumpster ramp

22:01.220 --> 22:03.300
behind the Kroger too hard, pops out,

22:03.300 --> 22:05.060
and just like a pixie stick you tore up

22:05.060 --> 22:07.060
and just like cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, cocaine,

22:07.060 --> 22:07.780
all over the place.

22:07.780 --> 22:09.940
What do you mean you gave Dave the bike?

22:09.940 --> 22:11.620
The jewels are in the bike.

22:11.620 --> 22:16.260
And then it's a whimsical cross country bike race.

22:16.260 --> 22:18.100
If the bike is full of cocaine,

22:18.100 --> 22:19.620
the wife is certainly horny

22:19.620 --> 22:21.620
to be taking that across state lines, eh?

22:21.620 --> 22:24.180
Seems like she wants it to ship Justin.

22:24.180 --> 22:25.620
Now it's on question asker.

22:26.260 --> 22:27.300
Oh my God.

22:28.020 --> 22:30.660
So you're saying that wife is using question asker

22:30.660 --> 22:32.660
as a drug mule.

22:32.660 --> 22:34.260
An unwilling, unknowing mule.

22:34.260 --> 22:35.460
I don't know there wasn't cocaine in it

22:35.460 --> 22:36.260
when we gave it to him.

22:37.140 --> 22:38.580
I don't know why you filled it up with cocaine.

22:38.580 --> 22:40.020
I don't know why you better do that.

22:40.020 --> 22:41.860
He said he's doing some mountain biking

22:41.860 --> 22:43.220
and wants some more weight in it

22:43.220 --> 22:44.500
to really grip the road.

22:44.500 --> 22:46.180
I don't know why that weight had to come from

22:46.740 --> 22:48.420
that chunky crystal white stuff,

22:48.420 --> 22:49.460
but here we are.

22:50.340 --> 22:50.980
Here we are.

22:50.980 --> 22:51.700
How about a Yahoo?

22:52.420 --> 22:53.060
Hit me.

22:53.060 --> 22:55.140
Yeah, this one was sent in by Seth Carlson.

22:55.140 --> 22:57.220
Seth Carlson, the delivery man?

22:57.220 --> 22:57.940
Yep.

22:57.940 --> 22:58.500
All right.

22:59.060 --> 23:00.420
Sorry, I got a YouTube ad.

23:01.060 --> 23:02.900
There's a video audio playing.

23:03.620 --> 23:05.700
And it's of Taylor Swift's bad new video.

23:05.700 --> 23:06.820
So let's just destroy that.

23:06.820 --> 23:09.700
Okay, stop all flash plugins.

23:09.700 --> 23:10.420
Siri.

23:10.420 --> 23:11.140
Here's one.

23:11.140 --> 23:11.940
Thank you, Seth.

23:11.940 --> 23:13.060
It's Yahoo Answers user.

23:13.060 --> 23:14.740
Earl the girl asks,

23:16.180 --> 23:19.300
what are the terms of your friendship contract?

23:21.780 --> 23:24.580
No additional details needed or posted.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.300
You got a buddy.

23:27.300 --> 23:28.260
You got a new buddy.

23:28.980 --> 23:30.980
And of course, you can't just go into that shit

23:30.980 --> 23:31.620
willy nilly.

23:31.620 --> 23:33.620
You got to protect yourself and your assets.

23:34.740 --> 23:36.420
What's the terms of your friendship contract?

23:36.420 --> 23:39.300
Hey, Jeremy, you seem nice.

23:39.940 --> 23:41.940
I'd like you to sign some paperwork for me

23:41.940 --> 23:45.060
before we go to the big baseball game.

23:45.060 --> 23:48.020
I need to protect myself and my assets

23:48.020 --> 23:50.900
in case you end up being a real jerk sword.

23:51.700 --> 23:55.220
Okay, I know one of my stipulations would have to be

23:55.860 --> 24:00.660
you have to let me know about two out of every three sick hangs.

24:01.300 --> 24:02.180
It's okay.

24:02.180 --> 24:05.700
It's okay if you want to go hang a couple times without me.

24:05.700 --> 24:07.940
But if I find out three times in a row

24:08.900 --> 24:10.580
there were sick hangs that came up

24:10.580 --> 24:13.220
and I was not informed about it,

24:13.220 --> 24:14.500
we're going to have beef.

24:14.500 --> 24:17.780
I think of a hang has a certain number of involved parties.

24:17.780 --> 24:20.340
Once it gets over three of my buds

24:20.340 --> 24:22.580
who are all also on contract with me.

24:22.580 --> 24:23.080
Yep.

24:24.980 --> 24:28.340
Once that happens, if I do not receive the evite,

24:28.340 --> 24:31.620
then something's broken down in this process.

24:32.420 --> 24:34.260
What are the terms of your friendship contract?

24:34.260 --> 24:37.940
I am allowed to get totally spooked

24:37.940 --> 24:40.260
at a scary movie we went to together

24:40.260 --> 24:43.140
and you can't post about it on Facebook or make fun of me.

24:43.140 --> 24:45.460
Don't you dare goof on me like that.

24:45.460 --> 24:45.960
Right.

24:45.960 --> 24:47.540
You know how I get spooked.

24:47.540 --> 24:51.380
I went and saw Annabelle shit my pants in a theater right there.

24:51.380 --> 24:54.020
Made a real bad soil mess right there in the theater.

24:54.020 --> 24:56.580
Don't you dare get on Twitter about that.

24:56.580 --> 24:57.080
Right.

24:57.700 --> 25:00.660
Because if you do, I'll sue you for $50,000

25:00.660 --> 25:03.860
for breach of contract.

25:04.980 --> 25:07.860
I think rule number one is don't fall in love.

25:09.220 --> 25:10.660
Because that's an issue.

25:10.660 --> 25:12.260
That's a whole different deal with it.

25:12.260 --> 25:12.760
Yeah.

25:14.020 --> 25:14.980
What are the terms?

25:14.980 --> 25:18.100
Now here's Yahoo Answers user weaselmcweasel says-

25:18.900 --> 25:20.500
Untrustworthy.

25:20.500 --> 25:22.260
Well, it's hateful.

25:22.260 --> 25:25.620
Number one, don't touch my Coca-Cola.

25:26.420 --> 25:27.540
Yeah, for sure.

25:27.540 --> 25:32.900
Well, hold on, I would say don't touch without permission.

25:32.900 --> 25:35.060
No, when would I ever give anybody permission

25:35.060 --> 25:36.900
to drink this good brown stuff?

25:37.620 --> 25:40.740
Number two, I have the right to kill anyone that does.

25:40.740 --> 25:44.900
So if you sign this and you touch this good brown drink

25:44.900 --> 25:46.420
and I fucking kill you,

25:48.100 --> 25:49.780
and then I go to court and the judge is like,

25:49.780 --> 25:51.060
ooh, I don't know about this.

25:51.060 --> 25:51.860
You killed him.

25:51.860 --> 25:53.380
And I was like, look at the contract.

25:53.380 --> 25:56.340
I had legal authority to kill him

25:56.340 --> 25:58.660
for touching like sweet Coca-Cola.

25:58.660 --> 26:00.740
What do you think your life is like

26:00.740 --> 26:03.380
when the best thing you have going for you

26:04.100 --> 26:05.300
is some Coca-Cola?

26:07.300 --> 26:09.060
The most important thing in the world to me

26:09.060 --> 26:10.820
that nobody better, not my children.

26:10.820 --> 26:14.500
Not my children or my money, my bank accounts,

26:14.500 --> 26:18.660
my social security number, my stocks and bonds.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.340
You better not lay a finger on my Butterfinger.

26:21.860 --> 26:23.380
Or is that just like accepted?

26:23.380 --> 26:23.940
That's it, that's it.

26:23.940 --> 26:25.380
Because Bart Simpson said it.

26:25.380 --> 26:29.060
When you tear open the package of a Butterfinger,

26:29.060 --> 26:30.980
you are agreeing to a contract

26:30.980 --> 26:32.900
that is printed on every Butterfinger label.

26:32.900 --> 26:34.740
Which is to say, if you touch my Butterfinger,

26:35.940 --> 26:38.420
the one who opens it, if they are not the one who eats it,

26:38.420 --> 26:40.340
you have legal authority to kill that second person.

26:40.340 --> 26:42.820
Just real quick, Weasel McWeasel does have a rule number three.

26:42.820 --> 26:45.220
If you drink my Coke, see rule number two.

26:45.860 --> 26:48.260
This is a little redundant, I feel.

26:48.260 --> 26:51.780
The secret to a good contract is you gotta keep it so tight.

26:51.780 --> 26:54.500
And so saying, number one, don't touch my Coca-Cola.

26:54.500 --> 26:56.260
Two, I have the right to kill anyone that does.

26:56.260 --> 26:58.580
And then having a third rule that's just like,

26:58.580 --> 27:00.900
seriously though, number two is-

27:00.900 --> 27:02.260
Griffin, I can't fault you there.

27:02.260 --> 27:05.060
Because everyone knows that one of the hallmarks of contracts

27:05.060 --> 27:07.220
is how brief and easy to read they are.

27:07.860 --> 27:10.580
So yes, agreed.

27:10.580 --> 27:16.660
What about like, you're my best friend forever sort of clause?

27:18.100 --> 27:20.180
What about if I kill someone,

27:20.180 --> 27:22.660
you have to say I was with you at that time?

27:22.660 --> 27:25.700
That's a little, that's a lot.

27:25.700 --> 27:27.540
What if I like to kill people a lot?

27:27.540 --> 27:28.020
Yeah.

27:28.020 --> 27:28.820
And then it gets like-

27:28.820 --> 27:30.580
Man, you hang out with Jeremy a ton.

27:32.180 --> 27:35.300
One crime committed and covered seems fair.

27:35.300 --> 27:38.980
Like, I feel like most of my friends could do something once.

27:38.980 --> 27:41.140
If it got like a little dextery,

27:41.140 --> 27:43.780
I think I might start to have bigger issues.

27:43.780 --> 27:45.140
I just think I would want,

27:45.700 --> 27:48.180
why are we having friendship contracts, I guess?

27:48.180 --> 27:52.100
Yes, why can't we just be good to each other?

27:52.660 --> 27:53.540
That's a contract.

27:54.420 --> 27:54.820
It is.

27:55.940 --> 27:58.420
We all signed it when we were born.

28:00.100 --> 28:00.820
That's your member?

28:02.660 --> 28:04.500
With your hand, with your little hand.

28:04.500 --> 28:05.140
That's what they do

28:05.140 --> 28:07.140
and they make you stamp your fingerprints down.

28:07.140 --> 28:08.740
It's just, and you look up and it's like,

28:08.740 --> 28:10.980
here's Griffin, 20 pound baby.

28:12.980 --> 28:14.100
Jesus Christ!

28:14.100 --> 28:18.500
The 20 pound baby and he promises to just be cool about it.

28:19.300 --> 28:20.500
Speaking of being cool,

28:20.500 --> 28:22.980
I think it's time for us to take a trip to the money zone.

28:33.700 --> 28:37.220
I want to start off this week by telling everybody about Zip Recruiter.

28:37.220 --> 28:38.420
Are you hiring?

28:38.420 --> 28:39.220
Do you know where to-

28:39.220 --> 28:39.860
Yes.

28:39.860 --> 28:41.060
I'm always hiring.

28:41.060 --> 28:44.020
You never know when I might find someone else I want to enlist.

28:46.020 --> 28:49.620
I'm hiring friends and you can apply at ziprecruiter.com.

28:50.340 --> 28:50.580
Really?

28:50.580 --> 28:55.300
You can post your job to 100 plus job sites with just one click.

28:55.300 --> 28:56.500
I mean, you can't beat that.

28:56.500 --> 28:58.020
It's so much easier.

28:58.020 --> 29:02.020
And get this, 80% of employers who post a job on Zip Recruiter

29:02.020 --> 29:06.660
to get a quality candidate through the site within one day.

29:07.300 --> 29:09.300
You can find out today why Zip Recruiter has been used

29:09.300 --> 29:13.220
by businesses of all sizes to find the most qualified job candidates

29:13.220 --> 29:14.660
with immediate result.

29:14.660 --> 29:16.340
Not immediate, probably.

29:16.340 --> 29:17.620
That would be weird.

29:17.620 --> 29:20.340
If someone replies to your job listing immediately,

29:21.780 --> 29:24.980
they are probably scoping you out.

29:24.980 --> 29:25.380
Absolutely.

29:25.380 --> 29:26.020
I feel like that-

29:26.020 --> 29:27.620
They are casing you.

29:27.620 --> 29:28.340
They're casing you.

29:28.340 --> 29:28.900
That's no good.

29:30.100 --> 29:32.740
But right now our listeners can post jobs on Zip Recruiter for free.

29:32.740 --> 29:33.300
That's right.

29:33.300 --> 29:34.420
You heard me right.

29:34.420 --> 29:35.540
For free.

29:35.540 --> 29:37.540
Just go to ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

29:37.540 --> 29:40.980
That's ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

29:40.980 --> 29:43.140
Try it for free right now.

29:43.140 --> 29:45.060
Ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

29:45.060 --> 29:47.940
If you go to ziprecruiter.com and you just search Griffin McElroy,

29:47.940 --> 29:50.660
very tall friend, you'll find the current opening.

29:50.660 --> 29:52.100
It's unfortunately like times are tight.

29:52.100 --> 29:54.500
And so that's the only one that we are hiring right now.

29:54.500 --> 29:58.180
And of course the contract is like, fuck, like 600, 700 pages long.

29:59.300 --> 30:00.580
How tall, Griffin?

30:00.580 --> 30:01.380
Give parameters.

30:02.420 --> 30:06.740
So what I put down on the listing was as big as my refrigerator.

30:06.740 --> 30:10.100
So I left a little wiggle room there because you don't know how tall my refrigerator is.

30:10.100 --> 30:11.860
But needless to say, it's very large.

30:11.860 --> 30:14.660
I need a very tall friend to help me get the big jug up there.

30:14.660 --> 30:16.580
It's been up there for years.

30:16.580 --> 30:18.180
I don't know how I got the damn thing up there.

30:18.180 --> 30:20.340
Must have thrown it up there like a basketball or something.

30:20.340 --> 30:24.020
But anyway, I do need a very tall friend to come over here and get that jug.

30:24.020 --> 30:27.620
And then if you do, maybe we can go see a movie or something.

30:27.620 --> 30:30.500
Is there a full time position that you're looking for or just like-

30:30.500 --> 30:33.700
I really just need you to get the big jug from on top of my tall fridge.

30:33.700 --> 30:37.140
How often do you need that?

30:37.140 --> 30:38.500
One time.

30:38.500 --> 30:38.980
Just one?

30:38.980 --> 30:40.100
You're not gonna put it back up there?

30:40.100 --> 30:40.820
I mean, I'll be honest.

30:40.820 --> 30:43.300
I got a tall fridge and there's lots of tall shelves up in there.

30:43.300 --> 30:47.620
And there's a lot of old stinky food up there that I just can't get.

30:47.620 --> 30:51.140
And the stink goes down in the cold air.

30:51.140 --> 30:53.860
And so I need somebody to help me because my produce, I just put it in there.

30:53.860 --> 31:01.140
And then it gets the stink of the cream cheese up there and some bread.

31:01.140 --> 31:05.300
What if they want to go see the movie before they get the big jug off your fridge?

31:05.300 --> 31:08.020
Oh, then they'll be fired immediately because that's not what the contract says.

31:08.660 --> 31:09.060
You're right.

31:09.060 --> 31:09.940
Read the fine print.

31:10.820 --> 31:12.020
It's all fine print, baby.

31:12.020 --> 31:14.740
700 pages of like font number four.

31:14.740 --> 31:16.660
Hey, I want to tell you all about Lyft.

31:16.660 --> 31:18.260
That's L-Y-F-T.

31:18.260 --> 31:22.260
Because what they do is you get in their car and they drive you wherever the fuck.

31:22.260 --> 31:24.420
And it's simple formula.

31:24.420 --> 31:25.860
Happy drivers mean happy passengers.

31:25.860 --> 31:30.500
Maybe that's why nine out of ten Lyft rides get a perfect five star rating.

31:30.500 --> 31:34.180
It's the first ride share platform with tipping built right into the app because getting tips

31:34.180 --> 31:37.620
shouldn't depend on your passenger having a crumpled bill in their pocket.

31:37.620 --> 31:41.060
And if you're a driver for them, you just keep 100% of the tips and they add up fast.

31:41.060 --> 31:44.740
Drivers have been paid over $200 million each.

31:44.740 --> 31:48.740
No, drivers have been paid over $200 million since the feature was first introduced.

31:48.740 --> 31:51.380
Man, you have ten little cigarette boats there.

31:51.380 --> 31:53.860
Yeah, I made $200 million driving with Lyft.

31:53.860 --> 31:54.500
It was awesome.

31:55.940 --> 31:59.940
Anyway, you can join the ride sharing company that believes in treating its people better

31:59.940 --> 32:07.060
if you go to lyft.com slash brother today and you can get a $500 new driver bonus.

32:07.060 --> 32:09.700
That's going to get you a little bit closer to that cigarette boat.

32:09.700 --> 32:14.020
That's lyft.com slash brother, lyft.com slash brother, limited times only.

32:14.020 --> 32:14.900
Terms do apply.

32:15.540 --> 32:20.820
Now, when you hear the term cigarette boat, do you, like me, picture the Oscar Mayer

32:20.820 --> 32:23.620
Wienermobile but like cigarette shaped in a boat?

32:23.620 --> 32:31.700
I just picture a big ugly boat where I can go and smoke my Marlboros in peace without

32:31.700 --> 32:39.300
having, you know, all of my coworkers, you know, pulling at my coat, pulling at my pants,

32:39.300 --> 32:40.500
trying to pull my pants down.

32:42.660 --> 32:46.900
Every time I go to the office and I smoke my smokes right there at my desk like I should

32:46.900 --> 32:50.980
be able to do and my coworkers just come up to me and try to rip my pants right off.

32:50.980 --> 32:56.580
So I want to get on my big old nasty barge that I bought for like 30 bucks and then just

32:56.580 --> 32:59.060
smoke it right there in the barge and then just went home.

32:59.060 --> 33:05.540
I always imagine just a boat so filled with cigarettes and the person driving it is like

33:05.540 --> 33:07.380
so happy because they love them.

33:07.380 --> 33:12.180
Yeah, they love the stuff and they're like just sailing around the pier like I can't

33:12.180 --> 33:18.100
believe I have so many but that's dangerous because the weather, you know, you get any

33:18.100 --> 33:18.900
sloshing.

33:18.900 --> 33:22.020
If you get a cigarette wet, that's pretty much it for that cigarette, I feel like.

33:22.580 --> 33:24.500
Do you guys remember Pepsi points?

33:24.500 --> 33:28.740
I always picture like a cigarette boat was a boat you bought with cigarette points.

33:28.740 --> 33:29.220
Oh, yeah.

33:29.220 --> 33:32.660
You smoked enough that you earned a boat with cigarettes.

33:32.660 --> 33:32.900
Yeah.

33:32.900 --> 33:33.620
Camel cash.

33:34.180 --> 33:34.420
Yeah.

33:35.140 --> 33:38.500
I got so many cooch balls with those camel cash dollars.

33:39.460 --> 33:45.460
I got a windbreaker just so I could show people like you can't believe how many I smoked for

33:45.460 --> 33:45.700
this.

33:45.700 --> 33:50.820
I like to get on my boat and show off all the fish my cigarette tricks I do.

33:52.660 --> 33:53.460
Wait, what?

33:53.460 --> 33:56.500
Do the fish do the cigarette tricks or you show the fish the cigarette tricks?

33:56.500 --> 33:59.860
I show the fish the cigarette tricks, you dumb ass.

33:59.860 --> 34:01.140
Why would the fish do it?

34:01.140 --> 34:02.260
They got wet mouths.

34:03.620 --> 34:05.220
The fuck stinks before you talk.

34:05.220 --> 34:05.700
Mr.

34:05.700 --> 34:06.260
Yeah, Mr.

34:06.260 --> 34:09.460
Olympid out there just huffing my Marlboros, just chucking them down.

34:09.460 --> 34:10.340
What are you talking about?

34:10.340 --> 34:10.820
It's a fish.

34:10.820 --> 34:12.420
It's 100% water.

34:12.420 --> 34:13.220
The fish vape?

34:13.220 --> 34:14.900
Now, fish can vape.

34:14.900 --> 34:16.340
Yeah, fish can go digital for sure.

34:16.340 --> 34:18.740
I was within striking distance.

34:18.740 --> 34:22.180
One additional breath of beginning to speak about Mr.

34:22.180 --> 34:22.660
Olympid.

34:22.660 --> 34:27.060
I'm so happy that you took that burden from me.

34:27.060 --> 34:28.500
I feel like we talk about Mr.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.900
Olympid one in five episodes.

34:30.900 --> 34:31.940
Is that true?

34:31.940 --> 34:32.740
We talk about Mr.

34:32.740 --> 34:33.780
Olympid a lot.

34:33.780 --> 34:34.500
Yes, true.

34:34.500 --> 34:36.420
If a dolphin or a whale vape.

34:37.780 --> 34:41.540
And this is a question that you can have as like a party game at home.

34:41.540 --> 34:43.300
Like the minister's cat.

34:44.260 --> 34:51.140
If a whale or a dolphin did vape, would you plug the carb or whatever the fuck into their

34:51.140 --> 34:52.980
mouth or into the blowhole?

34:52.980 --> 34:53.940
Discuss.

34:53.940 --> 34:58.180
No, I think you'd have to mouth in, blowhole out.

34:59.460 --> 35:00.500
That's weird.

35:00.500 --> 35:02.500
But that's how you get the sweet tricks, right?

35:02.500 --> 35:03.780
Like with your blowhole.

35:03.780 --> 35:05.860
But I think that's just not a trick.

35:05.860 --> 35:10.420
I think that's standard vaping protocol for a dolphin or whale or any blowhole equipped

35:10.420 --> 35:12.180
mammal, a platypus, I think has one.

35:12.180 --> 35:14.660
I'm almost certain blowhole is in an inn.

35:14.660 --> 35:16.180
I don't think they can breathe in through the blowhole.

35:16.180 --> 35:18.500
Well, that's what makes it a trick, Travis.

35:18.500 --> 35:19.000
Oh.

35:20.260 --> 35:22.100
Play with me in this space, will you?

35:22.100 --> 35:23.540
For God's sakes.

35:23.540 --> 35:24.980
They do have mouths.

35:24.980 --> 35:26.820
Why do dolphins need blowholes?

35:26.820 --> 35:27.860
Like they have mouths.

35:27.860 --> 35:28.420
It's greedy.

35:29.460 --> 35:30.260
It's greedy.

35:30.260 --> 35:35.140
I mean, I guess I have a poop hole so poop doesn't have to come out of my mouth.

35:35.140 --> 35:38.660
So go to lyft.com slash brother, lyft.com slash brother.

35:38.660 --> 35:40.260
Limited time only, terms do apply.

35:40.260 --> 35:41.300
Hey, tell me about this next time.

35:41.300 --> 35:43.380
Limited time only and we've wasted half of it.

35:43.380 --> 35:43.880
Sorry.

35:45.780 --> 35:48.180
Time's ticking down.

35:48.180 --> 35:53.060
So if you love sibling based humor, which I assume you do because you're listening to

35:53.060 --> 35:59.300
this show, join the brother and sister Emma and Luke as they review every Disney Channel

35:59.300 --> 36:02.260
original movie one month at a time.

36:02.260 --> 36:03.620
That's incredible.

36:03.620 --> 36:08.580
Join us as we completely trash these movies, which are all definite classic works of cinema

36:08.580 --> 36:10.420
and hold special places in our hearts.

36:10.420 --> 36:15.140
Okay, first of all, I don't know how I feel about that because I don't think I could trash

36:16.340 --> 36:18.980
Luck of the Irish, which I loved as a kid.

36:18.980 --> 36:20.340
Yeah, I mean, Zetas will beat us, dude.

36:20.340 --> 36:24.420
Like, you cannot talk shit about these DCOMs.

36:24.980 --> 36:28.740
What's the one where the youngest Lawrence brother cloned himself?

36:29.460 --> 36:30.340
Clone of my own?

36:31.460 --> 36:32.100
Clone Wars.

36:32.100 --> 36:33.140
Clone of my own?

36:33.140 --> 36:38.660
No, there is a one where the tiniest Lawrence cloned himself.

36:38.660 --> 36:39.460
What was it?

36:39.460 --> 36:40.180
Jesus God.

36:40.900 --> 36:43.060
And I think he did a dance with himself.

36:44.580 --> 36:47.140
Clone of my own is like such a good name for that movie.

36:47.140 --> 36:48.740
I can't imagine that's not it.

36:48.740 --> 36:49.460
It wasn't.

36:49.460 --> 36:50.260
I'm on Wikipedia.

36:50.260 --> 36:52.260
Do you hear how fucking frantically I'm typing?

36:52.260 --> 36:53.060
The other me.

36:53.620 --> 36:54.500
The other me.

36:55.300 --> 36:56.100
Yes, of course.

36:56.820 --> 37:01.780

Boy, they kept making it.

37:26.420 --> 37:27.780
I just Googled the list.

37:27.780 --> 37:30.100
I thought I was going to know a lot of the things on this list.

37:30.100 --> 37:31.860
What with Brink and what have you.

37:31.860 --> 37:34.020
But it's a lot of they've been making a lot of stuff.

37:34.020 --> 37:36.500
They made one in 2013 just called Teen Beach Movie.

37:37.940 --> 37:39.380
Couldn't get a title going for that one.

37:39.380 --> 37:41.700
I just went with Teen Beach Movie on that one.

37:41.700 --> 37:43.220
I was excited.

37:43.220 --> 37:48.980
Timothy Amundson, who was great in a bunch of things, but I was most excited when he

37:48.980 --> 37:53.700
responded to my tweets because he was in Luck of the Irish as the evil leprechaun.

37:53.700 --> 37:56.020
And I enjoyed his performance.

37:56.020 --> 37:57.380
I don't think I've ever told him that.

37:57.380 --> 37:58.260
Hey, everybody.

37:58.260 --> 38:02.980
Please don't tell my sort of Twitter friend, Timothy Amundson, that I most enjoyed his

38:02.980 --> 38:04.340
performance in Luck of the Irish.

38:04.340 --> 38:05.220
Thanks, everybody.

38:44.340 --> 38:47.540
Xenon Girl in the 21st Century was an amazing movie.

38:47.540 --> 38:53.460
And the guy who played Protozoa, I ran into him at a cafe in Yellow Springs, Ohio.

38:53.460 --> 38:54.660
You dropped this name, Travis.

38:55.780 --> 38:56.420
I can't remember.

38:56.420 --> 38:58.900
Let me pick up this name for you, Travis.

38:58.900 --> 38:59.780
Protozoa.

38:59.780 --> 39:01.220
And I'll hand it right back to you.

39:01.220 --> 39:02.660
You're such a fucking show off.

39:02.660 --> 39:04.900

39:07.300 --> 39:10.340
I always talk about his best friend, Protozoa.

39:10.900 --> 39:12.500
God, you've changed.

39:12.500 --> 39:14.980
I thought you don't live in LA anymore.

39:14.980 --> 39:15.700
But you've changed.

39:15.700 --> 39:17.380
Always talking about Protozoa.

39:18.340 --> 39:20.820
Once a Hollywood guy, always a Hollywood guy.

39:21.460 --> 39:23.220
God, all these movies are incredible.

39:23.220 --> 39:26.500
Um, hey, I've got a personal message for Rebecca.

39:26.500 --> 39:27.780
And it's from Michael, who says,

39:27.780 --> 39:28.740
Hey, Rebecca.

39:28.740 --> 39:30.420
Hey, hey, you know what?

39:30.420 --> 39:31.220
You know what?

39:32.020 --> 39:32.980
You're great.

39:32.980 --> 39:34.980
You're doing a great job of being a human being.

39:34.980 --> 39:35.940
And I'm the luckiest.

39:35.940 --> 39:41.220
Happy B-day slash secret anniversary slash becoming a mom slash official anniversary.

39:41.220 --> 39:42.980
I can't wait to meet our baby.

39:42.980 --> 39:46.180
Oh, also, I'm in the bathroom and we don't have any toilet paper.

39:46.180 --> 39:46.980
Can you get some?

39:46.980 --> 39:47.540
I'll wait.

39:48.100 --> 39:52.660
Now, they don't have a time, like a preferred time for this message listed here.

39:52.660 --> 39:54.740
But I assume that it's been a while.

39:54.740 --> 39:57.060
And that not only do they have a baby,

39:57.060 --> 40:01.140
but that Michael is just a skeleton in that bathroom still with poop all over his butt bones.

40:03.860 --> 40:05.140
Hey, Londoners.

40:23.540 --> 40:24.980
Get those tickets.

40:24.980 --> 40:27.620
For more information, go to MaximumFun.org

40:27.620 --> 40:30.900
and check out the live shows on the right side of the page.

40:31.540 --> 40:32.820
Go, do it.

40:35.540 --> 40:36.660
Here's another question.

40:37.860 --> 40:38.980
Wow, we only did one.

40:38.980 --> 40:39.300
Yeah.

40:39.300 --> 40:40.340
Okay, here's the second one.

40:40.340 --> 40:42.340
Well, we talked about protozoa for about 40 minutes,

40:42.340 --> 40:45.060
so you're not going to get a lot more content in this one, I think.

40:45.780 --> 40:48.580
I recently moved to a new city and one day after work,

40:48.580 --> 40:51.780
I went through the drive-through at a Dairy Queen I've never visited before.

40:51.780 --> 40:54.500
When I pulled up to the window, I immediately recognized the cashier,

40:54.500 --> 40:56.500
but I didn't know her name or how I knew her.

40:56.500 --> 40:58.340
She also expressed some similar recognition of me.

40:58.340 --> 41:00.420
We talked for a bit and determined we didn't go to a school together

41:00.420 --> 41:01.780
and are not from the same area.

41:01.780 --> 41:03.220
How do I find out who she is?

41:03.220 --> 41:04.180
Is my brain broken?

41:04.180 --> 41:05.460
That's from Lost in Louisville.

41:06.020 --> 41:07.940
How are we supposed to know this?

41:08.660 --> 41:11.140
How are we supposed to possess this information?

41:12.260 --> 41:15.300
Well, I think my suspicion is

41:15.300 --> 41:18.980
that you might be dealing with maybe like a past life scenario

41:18.980 --> 41:24.020
where you two were like BFFs in Egypt or something.

41:24.020 --> 41:29.300
Either that or you kind of look like somebody they knew

41:29.300 --> 41:31.780
and they kind of look like somebody you knew

41:31.780 --> 41:34.580
and memory is shit.

41:34.580 --> 41:38.100
Maybe it was Christmas in New York

41:38.100 --> 41:41.780
and you both tried to buy the same pair of black gloves at Blue Kicks.

41:41.780 --> 41:42.340
Okay.

41:42.340 --> 41:45.540
And then you fell in love, but then you were like,

41:45.540 --> 41:46.580
we can't right now.

41:46.580 --> 41:47.540
It's not a good time.

41:47.540 --> 41:51.700
And so you write down your name and love in the time of cholera

41:52.260 --> 41:53.380
and you send it out there.

41:53.380 --> 41:57.140
And if we find it again, we're going to get back together.

41:57.140 --> 41:58.180
But then you forgot.

41:58.180 --> 42:02.820
You both forgot.

42:02.820 --> 42:04.900
And then she got to work at Dairy Queen.

42:04.900 --> 42:07.220
You move there and you're like, hey, you look familiar.

42:07.220 --> 42:08.420
Is it the Seren did?

42:08.420 --> 42:11.140
No, you said she had a different face.

42:11.140 --> 42:12.740
All right.

42:12.740 --> 42:13.220
See ya.

42:15.220 --> 42:17.780
And this is our movie, 51st Serendipities.

42:19.940 --> 42:22.980
I heard Travis on the way, when Travis stopped at her house

42:22.980 --> 42:23.860
on the way back to his house,

42:23.860 --> 42:27.220
and I heard him determine a route home

42:27.220 --> 42:29.220
based on proximity to Dairy Queen.

42:29.220 --> 42:30.260
Travis, what's up with that?

42:30.260 --> 42:31.780
Hey, Travis, what's going on, bud?

42:31.780 --> 42:33.300
Dairy Queen's my favorite travel food.

42:33.300 --> 42:34.260
I think I've talked about that.

42:34.820 --> 42:36.180
You have not, no.

42:36.180 --> 42:38.180
Oh, well, Dairy Queen's-

42:38.180 --> 42:41.300
Yes, he has because the chicken strips

42:41.300 --> 42:43.460
are so dippable and they're gravy-centric.

42:43.460 --> 42:45.700
And we lambasted him for that choice.

42:45.700 --> 42:46.020
Thank you.

42:46.020 --> 42:46.820
I believe.

42:46.820 --> 42:48.020
Here's the thing.

42:48.020 --> 42:51.060
Dairy Queen's to me are a little bit mythical

42:51.060 --> 42:55.700
because I've never lived in what I would consider

42:55.700 --> 42:57.220
close proximity to one.

42:58.100 --> 43:01.620
And so when I see one, I get excited

43:01.620 --> 43:03.060
because it's not like a McDonald's

43:03.060 --> 43:04.900
where there's one every 10 feet.

43:04.900 --> 43:07.540
A Dairy Queen is like, oh, and like a Sonic.

43:07.540 --> 43:08.900
A Dairy Queen and a Sonic, you see them,

43:08.900 --> 43:12.100
you're like, oh, Dairy Queen, a Sonic,

43:12.100 --> 43:13.060
and you get excited.

43:13.060 --> 43:14.260
At least that's how I am.

43:14.820 --> 43:16.340
So when I'm traveling,

43:16.340 --> 43:18.180
if I'm going out of my way anyways,

43:18.180 --> 43:20.580
I like to plan my route by a Dairy Queen.

43:20.580 --> 43:21.780
There's nothing funny about it.

43:21.780 --> 43:22.900
I'm just a fan.

43:22.900 --> 43:24.420
I can take my coffee mug right now

43:24.420 --> 43:25.780
and open up my office window

43:25.780 --> 43:28.420
and throw it and hit a Dairy Queen down the street.

43:28.420 --> 43:30.100
This is not an exotic treat to me.

43:30.100 --> 43:31.540
And in fact, I don't know how I feel

43:31.540 --> 43:32.180
about the Dairy Queen

43:32.180 --> 43:33.380
because if I'm being honest,

43:33.380 --> 43:34.660
hot eats and cool treats,

43:34.660 --> 43:37.940
it's unfair that you get to do both.

43:37.940 --> 43:40.980
When I went to the country's best yogurt,

43:40.980 --> 43:42.980
there was a reason why we're the country's best yogurt

43:42.980 --> 43:45.460
is because we weren't also making chicken strips.

43:45.460 --> 43:47.860
So as we focused on a discipline, on a craft,

43:47.860 --> 43:50.340
and we mastered it and became the best at it.

43:52.180 --> 43:54.900
Why did they ever become the world's best yogurt, Griffin?

43:55.620 --> 44:01.060
Well, there's this fucking dope spot over in Barcelona.

44:01.060 --> 44:01.940
And like we know,

44:01.940 --> 44:06.020
it's actually required in the TCBY training session.

44:06.020 --> 44:10.420
You watch the video and then you practice.

44:10.420 --> 44:12.420
You gotta get seven ounces on the small.

44:12.420 --> 44:14.180
You gotta get nine ounces on the medium

44:14.180 --> 44:15.460
and 13 on the big.

44:15.460 --> 44:17.060
And then you gotta just practice that

44:17.060 --> 44:18.820
until your hand, it's just muscle memory.

44:18.820 --> 44:20.260
Always seven ounces, always seven ounces.

44:20.260 --> 44:21.460
And then you go to Barcelona

44:22.180 --> 44:24.260
and it's technically gelato there,

44:24.260 --> 44:26.180
but holy shit, you eat it and you're like,

44:26.180 --> 44:27.300
oh yeah, our shit sucks.

44:27.300 --> 44:28.980
Our shit is garbage.

44:28.980 --> 44:32.340
Wait, you study abroad at TCBY University?

44:32.340 --> 44:34.340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for like six months.

44:35.620 --> 44:36.820
It's so you don't get a big head.

44:37.540 --> 44:39.220
Like you start thinking you're cock of the walk,

44:39.220 --> 44:40.660
making the world's best yogurt,

44:40.660 --> 44:42.580
but then you go to Barcelona and it's like,

44:42.580 --> 44:43.460
ah, clearly not.

44:43.460 --> 44:44.660
Oh, I'm nothing, I'm nothing.

44:44.660 --> 44:46.500
I'm nothing, I'm a zilch over here.

44:46.500 --> 44:49.300
You know, Dairy Queen, they have to,

44:50.660 --> 44:51.780
when you get a blizzard,

44:51.780 --> 44:55.540
they have to up in the blizzard in front of you or it's free.

44:56.180 --> 44:57.940
That's a wild thing, huh?

44:57.940 --> 45:00.100
Like I don't know of any other restaurants

45:00.100 --> 45:04.020
that require food-based stunts when the food is ordered.

45:04.020 --> 45:04.820
I can't think of,

45:04.820 --> 45:07.220
it's not like when you go to McDonald's

45:07.220 --> 45:09.460
and they're like, they drop your Big Mac

45:09.460 --> 45:12.820
to show you that it stays together as a sandwich.

45:12.820 --> 45:13.940
Like you never have to,

45:13.940 --> 45:16.020
like they never have to, at Olive Garden,

45:16.020 --> 45:17.860
they don't like take a handful of your spaghetti

45:17.860 --> 45:20.020
and throw it at the wall to show that it sticks

45:20.020 --> 45:21.220
and it's properly cooked.

45:21.220 --> 45:22.500
There's a place here called Piteri's.

45:22.500 --> 45:23.540
It's a good little burger restaurant,

45:23.540 --> 45:24.820
beats the shit out of In-N-Out.

45:24.820 --> 45:25.780
Don't at me.

45:25.780 --> 45:28.180
And what they do is they have to take a drink of your lemonade

45:28.180 --> 45:29.860
and a bite of your burger and a bite of your fries

45:29.860 --> 45:32.100
just to prove to you it's not poison every time.

45:33.140 --> 45:34.340
If they don't, it's free.

45:34.340 --> 45:36.100
If they don't, it's free and it's also poison.

45:36.100 --> 45:36.660
Don't eat it.

45:37.940 --> 45:39.860
How about this Yahoo that was sent in by-

45:39.860 --> 45:40.820
Free poison burgers.

45:41.380 --> 45:43.780
Sent in by, they're so good, I would still fucking do it.

45:45.460 --> 45:47.860
Hold on, I want to hear this Yahoo very bad.

45:47.860 --> 45:50.020
I'm very worried that people have started tweeting

45:50.020 --> 45:53.300
to Timothy Amundsen that Travis didn't enjoy his performance

45:53.860 --> 45:55.060
in Lucky Irish.

45:55.060 --> 45:56.180
No, no, no, I loved it.

45:56.180 --> 45:59.620
I'm concerned that Travis just enjoys all your work

45:59.620 --> 46:02.020
but not your performance in Lucky Irish.

46:02.020 --> 46:02.580
That is my-

46:02.580 --> 46:04.820
You said your shit sucked in that Irish-

46:04.820 --> 46:06.020
No, no, no, I didn't.

46:06.020 --> 46:06.900
I loved it.

46:06.900 --> 46:08.900
That's when I first became a fan.

46:08.900 --> 46:11.220
I just don't want him to know that.

46:12.100 --> 46:12.600
Okay.

46:14.020 --> 46:14.520
Okay.

46:15.380 --> 46:16.180
Jesus.

46:16.180 --> 46:17.780
Okay, so I was about to read this Yahoo,

46:17.780 --> 46:20.820
but I saw one in the suggested questions sidebar

46:20.820 --> 46:23.700
and it says, solve my Harry Potter riddle.

46:23.700 --> 46:28.500
Well, hint, I'm not sure where your loyalty lies.

46:28.500 --> 46:30.740
Keep your chin up to the royal skies.

46:32.260 --> 46:32.820
That's it.

46:32.820 --> 46:33.940
That's all that's in your riddle.

46:33.940 --> 46:35.940
Your riddle sucks so bad.

46:37.220 --> 46:39.460
Your riddle sucks really, really bad.

46:39.460 --> 46:40.260
I mean, I think it's the-

46:40.260 --> 46:41.620
Give it to me one more time.

46:41.620 --> 46:42.020
It's the-

46:42.020 --> 46:42.580
Give it to me one more time.

46:43.780 --> 46:45.460
I'm not sure where your loyalty lies.

46:45.460 --> 46:47.300
Keep your chin up to the royal skies.

46:47.300 --> 46:52.580
It is another one, this user, whose name is not appearing.

46:52.580 --> 46:54.980
Can you solve my Harry Potter based riddle?

46:54.980 --> 46:58.020
And then there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

46:58.020 --> 47:00.500
nine, 10, 11 empty spots.

47:00.500 --> 47:01.460
That's it.

47:01.460 --> 47:02.100
That's all it is.

47:02.100 --> 47:04.900
It's like 11 letters, but you didn't tell me what it is.

47:04.900 --> 47:06.100
Voldemort, is that 11?

47:06.100 --> 47:08.260
I'm going to assume it is, asshole.

47:10.260 --> 47:14.340
All right, anyway, I've lost the original question.

47:14.340 --> 47:15.540
Can we end the show?

47:15.540 --> 47:17.940
No, no.

47:17.940 --> 47:18.900
Is one-

47:18.900 --> 47:20.340
It's been sent in by Aaron Keys.

47:20.340 --> 47:20.820
Thank you, Aaron.

47:20.820 --> 47:22.260
It's Yahoo Answers user anonymous.

47:22.260 --> 47:23.700
It was asked by Voldemort, who says,

47:26.100 --> 47:28.020
I'll get you Harry Potter.

47:28.020 --> 47:30.100
Can you become a celebrity for arguing-

47:30.100 --> 47:33.620
I put mayonnaise on my fries.

47:33.620 --> 47:34.020
All right.

47:34.900 --> 47:37.620
Can you become a celebrity for arguing with a celebrity

47:37.620 --> 47:38.820
on Twitter and winning?

47:41.060 --> 47:42.900
So a lot of motherfuckers seem to think so.

47:42.900 --> 47:45.060
Oh, man.

47:46.260 --> 47:48.980
Well, here's what I think about global warming Whoopi Goldberg,

47:49.540 --> 47:51.300
and then fucking you watch the news that night.

47:51.300 --> 47:52.420
It's like, he got her.

47:53.140 --> 47:53.620
Got her.

47:54.500 --> 47:59.460
Luke James from Des Moines really burned the shit out

47:59.460 --> 48:00.660
of Whoopi today.

48:00.660 --> 48:01.460
Oh, my God.

48:01.460 --> 48:02.660
Y'all got to see this.

48:02.660 --> 48:04.740
He's got a book deal.

48:04.740 --> 48:08.980
He really went to town on Whoopi's just logic here.

48:08.980 --> 48:11.780
Really jumped on all the gaps in the reasoning here

48:11.780 --> 48:13.860
of Whoopi Goldberg from Sister Act.

48:16.260 --> 48:19.700
This is actually what celebrities hope nobody ever finds out,

48:19.700 --> 48:22.820
which is that that's how the mantle passes.

48:22.820 --> 48:25.780
You have to win specifically a Twitter argument.

48:25.780 --> 48:28.420
You can't like find Joaquin Phoenix in real life

48:28.420 --> 48:31.300
and be like, chocolate's better.

48:31.300 --> 48:32.580
And like, that won't work.

48:32.580 --> 48:36.180
But like, if online you start a fight with Joaquin Phoenix

48:36.180 --> 48:39.140
and you win, and that can be hard to prove sometimes,

48:39.140 --> 48:40.580
you got to run it by the judges,

48:40.580 --> 48:44.020
and you win, you get to be in her too.

48:45.220 --> 48:47.780
Oh, you become the celebrity.

48:47.780 --> 48:48.340
Exactly.

48:49.140 --> 48:50.740
And then Joaquin Phoenix is out.

48:50.740 --> 48:53.540
That's what that weird Joaquin Phoenix movie happened

48:53.540 --> 48:55.540
when he got a shit done on his face.

48:56.900 --> 49:00.180
Was he had a break there because he was talking about like,

49:00.180 --> 49:02.340
I think pit bulls are dangerous.

49:02.340 --> 49:05.460
And somebody was like, oh, no, you didn't Joaquin Phoenix.

49:05.460 --> 49:07.540
And then the news was like, did you hear?

49:07.540 --> 49:11.780
Jeff James got Joaquin Phoenix so good,

49:11.780 --> 49:14.900
dunked on him so high, and now he's the her man.

49:16.260 --> 49:18.020
Now he's the her two man star.

49:18.020 --> 49:19.300
He's the Herman.

49:19.300 --> 49:22.660
Do you have to take over the career of the star

49:22.660 --> 49:23.940
that you beat in a Twitter argument?

49:23.940 --> 49:24.980
Absolutely.

49:24.980 --> 49:27.300
Sister L3 is during me, Griffin McElroy.

49:27.300 --> 49:28.660
It's farther than that, Justin.

49:28.660 --> 49:30.260
Actually, it's you swap bodies.

49:30.820 --> 49:31.620
Oh, no.

49:32.580 --> 49:34.660
So if you've ever seen a star and it was like,

49:34.660 --> 49:38.740
why does it seem like Zac Efron jumps back and forth

49:38.740 --> 49:41.380
between making like Nicholas Sparks movies,

49:41.380 --> 49:43.300
but also bad grandpa?

49:43.300 --> 49:44.900
And it's because he's really bad

49:44.900 --> 49:46.900
at arguing with people on Twitter.

49:46.900 --> 49:47.460
Yeah.

49:47.460 --> 49:49.780
So it's just like somebody else takes over his body

49:49.780 --> 49:53.620
and then it's like, I'm making the new beach movie.

49:53.620 --> 49:55.060
And then another person takes over,

49:55.060 --> 49:57.300
like, I'm making a movie where I sail a boat

49:57.300 --> 49:58.340
and my little brother died.

49:58.340 --> 49:59.940
That's because he's always trying to start shit.

49:59.940 --> 50:00.900
He gets on Twitter and he's like,

50:00.900 --> 50:03.540
I don't know why we don't just call Pringles potato chips.

50:03.540 --> 50:06.020
And then somebody's like, I'm famous.

50:06.020 --> 50:07.540
I'm gonna get this fucking guy.

50:08.340 --> 50:09.620
That is a good point, Travis.

50:09.620 --> 50:10.420
Thank you for bringing that up.

50:10.420 --> 50:14.180
If Zac Efron ever tries to start an argument with you

50:14.180 --> 50:15.620
on Twitter, do not engage with him

50:15.620 --> 50:17.860
because he's trying to claw his way back up.

50:17.860 --> 50:23.540
He's starting low and you should be careful of that

50:23.540 --> 50:25.140
because you don't want him to be like,

50:25.140 --> 50:27.380
and now I'm the assistant manager at Borders.

50:27.380 --> 50:29.780
Like, okay, well, that's fine.

50:29.780 --> 50:34.340
And now you have to be Zac Efron, like, in his body.

50:34.340 --> 50:35.140
You understand?

50:35.140 --> 50:36.420
It's very confusing.

50:36.420 --> 50:38.900
Definitely, but that's why John Cusack's

50:38.900 --> 50:40.100
always trying to fight with everybody.

50:40.100 --> 50:42.100
He doesn't wanna be John Cusack anymore.

50:44.020 --> 50:48.420
I don't, there's gotta be some sort of reward

50:48.420 --> 50:50.420
either in this life or Valhalla

50:51.460 --> 50:53.300
that you get for arguing with celebs

50:53.300 --> 50:54.900
because it's literally every,

50:56.660 --> 50:59.140
at Dax Shepard, great day today.

50:59.140 --> 51:00.420
No, it isn't, you fucker.

51:01.060 --> 51:03.940
First and through 100th response,

51:03.940 --> 51:06.740
fuck you, Dax, it's a shitty day.

51:06.740 --> 51:09.620
Got him, now I'm the Dax man.

51:09.620 --> 51:11.780
There's gotta be some reason why people are like,

51:13.140 --> 51:16.820
I've got like, what, five billion minutes on this earth.

51:16.820 --> 51:18.580
I'm gonna spend one of them just dunking

51:18.580 --> 51:20.580
right on Dax Shepard from Punk'd.

51:21.700 --> 51:22.740
What are you guys doing?

51:22.740 --> 51:24.500
Because there's other stuff you could be doing.

51:24.500 --> 51:27.060
You could go out and try and catch a butterfly or something

51:27.060 --> 51:27.780
and then let it go.

51:27.780 --> 51:29.940
And Griffin, that's why it's sad.

51:29.940 --> 51:32.820
They don't want to fight with celebrities,

51:32.820 --> 51:34.340
but they have to.

51:34.340 --> 51:35.460
Go out and catch a butterfly

51:35.460 --> 51:37.060
and tell them it's wrong about climate change.

51:38.740 --> 51:41.060
That's the thing, it's the only way

51:41.060 --> 51:43.460
to thin the celebrity herd, Griffin,

51:43.460 --> 51:46.020
is if you fight with them and it's like,

51:46.020 --> 51:48.740
okay, that's the only way we can cycle through new movies.

51:49.300 --> 51:51.700
How do you think the new Chips movie got made?

51:51.700 --> 51:53.300
Because Dax Shepard fought with someone

51:53.300 --> 51:54.740
about whether or not it was a nice day,

51:54.740 --> 51:58.100
you know, and then Chips gets made.

51:58.100 --> 52:00.020
It's the only way we get movies.

52:00.020 --> 52:01.620
Dax don't care.

52:02.340 --> 52:03.620
I cannot stress this enough.

52:04.260 --> 52:05.940
If you ever get in a fight with Dax Shepard

52:05.940 --> 52:08.100
or enter any celebrity name here,

52:09.140 --> 52:10.020
Dax don't care.

52:10.660 --> 52:12.580
Dax might even reply and Dax ain't gonna care.

52:12.580 --> 52:14.500
That one's just gonna roll right off Dax's back,

52:14.500 --> 52:17.060
his famous happily married back.

52:17.620 --> 52:19.060
It's been sneaking up on me lately

52:19.060 --> 52:20.660
that I think Dax Shepard might be,

52:21.780 --> 52:23.940
and I don't know, I don't know anyone's mental standpoint,

52:23.940 --> 52:27.780
but he's got a pretty good deal going on.

52:27.780 --> 52:29.220
Yeah, he's doing good, it's Dax.

52:29.220 --> 52:31.940
And so if you tweeted him saying,

52:33.300 --> 52:36.980
you know, your thoughts about anything

52:36.980 --> 52:39.380
that Dax Shepard has very strong opinions about,

52:39.380 --> 52:42.180
which based on my only exposure to Dax these days

52:42.180 --> 52:45.220
is those washing machine commercials

52:45.220 --> 52:46.820
he does with Kristen Bell

52:46.820 --> 52:49.140
is just what a good laundry machine is.

52:50.980 --> 52:52.500
He doesn't give a shit.

52:52.500 --> 52:53.860
Nobody gives a shit.

52:53.860 --> 52:56.260
I have people that I know who tweet at celebrities like,

52:56.260 --> 52:58.420
well, here's what I think of that movie you just talked,

52:58.420 --> 52:59.940
he doesn't fucking care.

52:59.940 --> 53:01.060
Nobody, they don't care.

53:01.060 --> 53:02.260
They're not gonna read it and care.

53:02.900 --> 53:05.380
Yeah, the thing that is different

53:05.380 --> 53:07.220
about celebrities versus us,

53:07.220 --> 53:08.580
and everybody's always wondering,

53:08.580 --> 53:09.860
what do they do differently?

53:09.860 --> 53:11.700
Is that they don't fucking give a shit

53:11.700 --> 53:13.220
and they don't read their replies

53:13.220 --> 53:14.340
and they're not saying like,

53:14.340 --> 53:17.060
well, except when they are,

53:17.060 --> 53:18.500
and that gets a little uncomfortable

53:18.500 --> 53:20.180
because sometimes they definitely do.

53:20.180 --> 53:22.180
Sometimes, oh yeah, that's a good caveat.

53:22.180 --> 53:23.940
Sometimes they definitely care.

53:23.940 --> 53:25.460
I've actually been campaigning.

53:25.460 --> 53:27.380
I've been campaigning on this one for a while.

53:27.940 --> 53:29.300
Never tweet anything.

53:29.300 --> 53:30.740
And if someone responds to you,

53:30.740 --> 53:31.700
don't ever respond,

53:31.700 --> 53:33.140
I didn't expect you to read it.

53:33.140 --> 53:34.980
Then why did you tag them in it?

53:35.700 --> 53:37.380
Tagged them right in it.

53:37.380 --> 53:39.540
You don't have to at them if you don't like,

53:40.260 --> 53:41.620
that's like handing me a note

53:41.620 --> 53:42.260
and then being like,

53:42.260 --> 53:43.780
I didn't expect you to read the note.

53:43.780 --> 53:45.140
You handed it to me.

53:45.780 --> 53:47.060
Just keep it in your pocket.

53:47.620 --> 53:50.500
There's a certain level of pseudo celebrity

53:50.500 --> 53:52.180
where you read them all.

53:52.180 --> 53:55.220
And there's, I don't know anybody on this podcast.

53:57.140 --> 53:58.180
Not anymore.

53:58.180 --> 53:59.060
Not anymore, bro.

54:00.180 --> 54:01.940
Yeah, I don't, I try to,

54:02.580 --> 54:04.500
it got to be too much at a certain point.

54:05.620 --> 54:07.460
But I do still dip in there.

54:07.460 --> 54:08.900
And you know, the funny thing about it

54:08.900 --> 54:11.220
is the ones that I seem to notice and remember

54:11.220 --> 54:12.260
are the mean ones.

54:12.260 --> 54:13.300
That's weird, isn't it?

54:13.300 --> 54:14.500
That seems weird to me.

54:14.500 --> 54:16.420
But thank you for all your kind tweets.

54:17.220 --> 54:19.780
Just reading about on Dax Shepard's feed right now.

54:19.780 --> 54:20.580
I'm trying to find it.

54:20.580 --> 54:20.980
What's he into?

54:20.980 --> 54:21.460
What's he up to?

54:21.460 --> 54:22.180
How's he doing?

54:22.180 --> 54:23.460
Let's click over it.

54:23.460 --> 54:24.420
Dax, Dax Shepard.

54:24.420 --> 54:25.860
We cannot have a show where two thirds

54:25.860 --> 54:26.500
of people are reading Dax.

54:26.500 --> 54:27.460
He's at Dax Shepard one.

54:28.100 --> 54:30.260
Couldn't get at Dax Shepard.

54:30.260 --> 54:32.340
Oh, who's holding out?

54:32.340 --> 54:33.140
I'm going to look and see what.

54:33.140 --> 54:35.140
Yeah, find me the original Dax Shepard.

54:35.140 --> 54:36.820
Oh, hasn't tweeted.

54:36.820 --> 54:39.540
Just sitting on it since April 2009.

54:39.540 --> 54:41.060
Dax, talk to them.

54:41.060 --> 54:44.180
And it's, oh, oh, oh.

54:44.180 --> 54:46.980
The description is punked employee of the month

54:46.980 --> 54:49.700
without a paddle, et cetera.

54:49.700 --> 54:50.900
That ain't you.

54:50.900 --> 54:52.500
That is not at Dax Shepard.

54:52.500 --> 54:55.220
Dax, if you want it, it'll just cost you one night

54:55.220 --> 54:56.340
with you, Dax Shepard.

54:56.340 --> 54:56.740
Come on.

54:57.380 --> 54:58.020
Come on.

54:58.020 --> 54:58.420
Come on.

54:58.420 --> 54:59.380
You want this Tweeto?

54:59.380 --> 55:01.300
Come fuck this, Dax, please.

55:02.260 --> 55:03.300
Come punk this butt.

55:04.820 --> 55:05.860
Punk my butt, Dax.

55:06.660 --> 55:08.260
Happy birthday, happy birthday, Kristen Bell.

55:08.260 --> 55:10.340
And like a million tweets of people like, great.

55:10.340 --> 55:11.140
Love this wedding.

55:11.140 --> 55:12.020
Love this marriage.

55:12.820 --> 55:14.340
I don't think he, maybe he does care.

55:14.340 --> 55:14.900
I don't know.

55:14.900 --> 55:15.780
I'm, I can't.

55:15.780 --> 55:17.860
I'm so deep down the Dax hole right now.

55:17.860 --> 55:19.620
It's just, if you're listening to this podcast,

55:19.620 --> 55:20.820
if you're under the power of my voice,

55:21.940 --> 55:23.140
don't tweet at Dax Shepard.

55:24.020 --> 55:24.420
Please.

55:25.460 --> 55:26.900
But do follow him.

55:26.900 --> 55:27.460
Absolutely.

55:27.460 --> 55:29.300
A source of great insight in comedy.

55:29.940 --> 55:32.260
We did talk about without a paddle for a couple minutes

55:32.260 --> 55:34.660
a few years back, and I don't think that any of that

55:34.660 --> 55:37.220
was admissible in Friendship Court.

55:37.220 --> 55:38.180
At least I hope not.

55:38.180 --> 55:39.220
Tough shit, dude.

55:39.220 --> 55:40.660
We burnt like four bridges there.

55:40.660 --> 55:47.620
Dax, Seth, the Scooby Doo one.

55:47.620 --> 55:49.060
So good on Twin Peaks, by the way.

55:49.060 --> 55:50.900
Mr. Lillard, if you're listening.

55:50.900 --> 55:51.860
Everybody's great.

55:51.860 --> 55:52.980
All, you know what?

55:53.700 --> 55:54.740
I'll go on record.

55:54.740 --> 55:57.380
All celebrities except the racist and terrible

55:57.380 --> 55:58.900
problematic ones are great.

55:58.900 --> 55:59.380
There.

55:59.380 --> 55:59.940
I said it.

55:59.940 --> 56:00.580
They're all great.

56:00.580 --> 56:03.140
They all make good work unless they are incredibly

56:03.140 --> 56:05.140
problematic, at which point they are not great.

56:05.140 --> 56:05.460
Not.

56:06.100 --> 56:07.220
Not great at all.

56:07.220 --> 56:08.180
You heard it here.

56:08.180 --> 56:11.140
And sometimes they go from the first group into the second

56:11.140 --> 56:13.220
group, and that's challenging.

56:13.220 --> 56:17.380
If they did, we knew it the whole time, and we retroactively

56:17.380 --> 56:18.740
didn't mean them.

56:18.740 --> 56:21.540
Fucking Tim Allen ejaculates into group two,

56:21.540 --> 56:22.820
and I'm like, mm, called it.

56:30.820 --> 56:31.780
I'm a piece of shit.

56:31.780 --> 56:32.420
Uh-huh.

56:32.420 --> 56:33.460
Called that one.

56:33.460 --> 56:34.180
Gotcha, Tim.

56:34.180 --> 56:38.740
I got Tim on that one.

56:38.740 --> 56:40.180
And then you're like, fuck you, Tim.

56:40.180 --> 56:40.980
He doesn't care.

56:41.540 --> 56:42.340
He don't care.

56:43.300 --> 56:44.020
He doesn't care.

56:44.900 --> 56:47.140
Now, that's a man with a Twitter bio right there,

56:47.140 --> 56:47.940
is Tim Allen.

56:49.300 --> 56:50.180
This is so good.

56:52.740 --> 56:55.140
Tim Allen, his bio says, Santa?

56:55.780 --> 56:56.980
Buzz Lightyear?

56:56.980 --> 56:58.260
The Toolman?

56:58.260 --> 56:59.460
Mike Baxter?

56:59.460 --> 57:01.860
Hey, I'm still that wisecracking kid from the

57:01.860 --> 57:04.500
Midwest looking for answers to life's big questions.

57:05.300 --> 57:05.940
You're Buzz Lightyear.

57:05.940 --> 57:07.540
I'm doing time for selling drugs.

57:07.540 --> 57:08.820
You're Buzz Lightyear.

57:09.780 --> 57:13.140
Your header image is Santa Claus looking lovingly at Buzz

57:13.140 --> 57:13.860
Lightyear.

57:13.860 --> 57:15.860
You are not the wisecracking kid from the Midwest.

57:15.860 --> 57:18.340
You are Santa and Buzz Lightyear, the Toolman,

57:18.340 --> 57:20.580
and whoever the fuck Mike Baxter is.

57:20.580 --> 57:22.980
If you look at Tim Allen's Twitter header,

57:22.980 --> 57:28.020
it is so fuckwild because it's Santa Claus in the middle,

57:28.020 --> 57:29.540
and then Buzz Lightyear to the right,

57:29.540 --> 57:32.660
and then a blank void to the left as if he's leaving room

57:32.660 --> 57:35.060
for another treasured character that he may create in the

57:35.060 --> 57:35.460
future.

57:36.900 --> 57:38.500
The other treasured character is him,

57:38.500 --> 57:41.060
a wisecracking kid from the Midwest just looking for

57:41.060 --> 57:42.900
answers to life's big questions.

57:42.900 --> 57:46.340
My dude, you are looking in all the wrong places because

57:46.340 --> 57:48.820
your shit sucks now, Timothy.

57:48.820 --> 57:50.740
It might have always sucked, but now you're just kind of

57:50.740 --> 57:52.820
being a little bit more public about it,

57:52.820 --> 57:54.340
sliding right into group two.

57:54.340 --> 57:55.220
I knew it.

57:55.220 --> 57:56.100
I knew.

57:56.100 --> 57:57.620
I was the one who knew about Timothy.

57:57.620 --> 58:00.500
He also has a picture of himself as him and him,

58:00.500 --> 58:01.380
and it says Tim and him.

58:02.260 --> 58:03.140
That's on his Twitter.

58:03.140 --> 58:05.860
There's a lot of great things and not so great things

58:05.860 --> 58:06.660
waiting for you.

58:06.660 --> 58:08.260
A lot of bad content, actually.

58:08.260 --> 58:08.580
Hmm.

58:09.140 --> 58:09.940
Try this.

58:09.940 --> 58:10.420
Try this.

58:10.420 --> 58:12.580
If Jimmy is from August 19th, try this.

58:12.580 --> 58:14.980
If Jimmy cracked corn and no one's cares,

58:14.980 --> 58:16.900
why did we sing a song about him?

58:16.900 --> 58:19.700
Looking for answers to the big ones,

58:19.700 --> 58:21.780
the questions, because that's me from the Midwest,

58:21.780 --> 58:23.940
a wisecracking kid, not Buzz Lightyear.

58:23.940 --> 58:26.340
I want to address something on his Twitter feed.

58:26.340 --> 58:28.740
He tweeted a while ago, and a lot of people addressed this.

58:28.740 --> 58:30.420
He tweeted, if we evolve from apes,

58:30.420 --> 58:31.780
why are there still apes?

58:31.780 --> 58:32.420
Okay.

58:32.420 --> 58:35.940
And some people said, that's not serious.

58:35.940 --> 58:37.140
He was joking.

58:37.140 --> 58:40.420
And then he did the next day tweet, comedy ain't pretty,

58:40.420 --> 58:42.260
and to some, not so funny.

58:42.260 --> 58:44.180
And then on the 18th tweeted,

58:44.180 --> 58:47.460
maybe I will do the ape evolved bit at the Gig

58:47.460 --> 58:49.540
and Wonderful Paramount Theater in Illinois.

58:49.540 --> 58:50.420
Now, here's the thing.

58:50.980 --> 58:52.660
One of two things is possible.

58:52.660 --> 58:55.220
Either he sincerely tweeted, if we evolve from apes,

58:55.220 --> 58:56.180
why are there still apes?

58:56.180 --> 58:59.540
Or he thought that was a hilarious joke.

59:00.420 --> 59:04.260
And the second one is more like, oh, his classic,

59:04.260 --> 59:07.140
if we evolve from apes, why are there still apes bit?

59:07.140 --> 59:07.620
Yeah.

59:07.620 --> 59:09.140
Well, that's how he does it.

59:09.140 --> 59:11.380
He's looking for answers to life's big questions.

59:11.380 --> 59:13.780
Questions like, if we evolve from apes,

59:13.780 --> 59:15.300
why there are still apes?

59:15.300 --> 59:17.620
And then a billion people on Twitter are like,

59:17.620 --> 59:19.940
tool man, you're a fucking idiot.

59:19.940 --> 59:22.020
And then he's like, okay, so that's not one of them.

59:23.380 --> 59:25.940
That big question's still out there about the apes.

59:25.940 --> 59:26.820
You know what though?

59:26.820 --> 59:28.420
Apparently people got real rides out of it.

59:28.420 --> 59:29.780
I'm gonna do it at my comedy show.

59:29.780 --> 59:32.020
My bad comedy show that you paid $30 to come see.

59:34.340 --> 59:35.700
Doing stand up, huh Tim?

59:39.540 --> 59:41.540
Gotta see that wisecracking kid from the Midwest

59:41.540 --> 59:43.460
for $30 at Aurora, Illinois.

59:43.460 --> 59:45.700
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

59:45.700 --> 59:47.860
People just fucking shitting their pants, screaming.

59:47.860 --> 59:49.380
Chris, grunt more.

59:49.380 --> 59:50.580
You're not Buzz Lightyear.

59:50.580 --> 59:52.580
You're a wisecracking kid.

59:52.580 --> 59:53.380
Is that Santa?

59:53.380 --> 59:54.340
No.

59:54.340 --> 59:56.740
Santa's on stage with us, it's not Santa.

59:59.540 --> 01:00:00.340
That's not Santa up there.

01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:01.780
That's just a humble wisecracking kid.

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:05.940
Look at him ejaculate up there, hilarious.

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:07.860
Is that Mike Baxter, whoever the fuck that is?

01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:10.580
No, that's just Tim, just Tim.

01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:11.860
I think that's from his wack new show

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:13.460
that we've somehow allowed to continue

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:14.820
for many, many years.

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:17.220
Many years longer than Last Man Standing

01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:18.980
should have been standing.

01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:22.260
If your kid looks at Tim Allen and says,

01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:26.260
is that Santa Claus, things have gone terribly wrong.

01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:28.740
Things have gone desperately wrong for you as a parent.

01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:31.380
Santa Claus is and always will be John Hammond

01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:33.220
from Jurassic Park, Actor Man.

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:36.420
That's gonna do it for us on this episode

01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:38.980
of My Brother, Me, We Hope You've Enjoyed Yourself

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:41.220
and had a good time.

01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:43.300
Is there anything we wanna talk about this week?

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:44.100
Anything going on?

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:46.820
Oh yeah, I need lots and lots of yahoos, please,

01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:49.060
because we are about to do three shows back to back

01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:51.940
this coming weekend in New York, DC, and Boston.

01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:54.100
I think tickets are all sold out on this leg.

01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:58.340
But if you wanna come see us in October, November,

01:00:58.340 --> 01:00:59.860
you can still get tickets, I believe,

01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:01.060
for the Milwaukee show.

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:04.500
I think Minneapolis is done so.

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:06.660
You can find ticket links and everything

01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:10.980
at mackleroyshows.com slash tours, is that right?

01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:13.700
And we have other shows on that thing,

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:17.300
including a new show that me and Rachel are doing.

01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:19.380
Well, it's sort of a revamped version of Rose Buddies

01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:20.820
that should be launching this week,

01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:22.820
which I'm very, very excited about.

01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:23.700
Excellent.

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:26.660
I wanted to make two quick notes

01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:28.020
about those shows this weekend.

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:33.940
Sometimes at those shows, the tickets are released

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:36.500
at a very, very limited number of tickets

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:37.940
are released at the window.

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:40.500
So if you wanted to try for that,

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.020
that may be a possibility.

01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:43.700
There's no guarantees, it may not happen,

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.300
but I know it has happened in the past.

01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:46.340
So just so you know.

01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:51.300
Also, we have traditionally gone out after the shows

01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:53.700
to sign things and what have you.

01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:57.220
I don't think we're gonna be able to do that

01:01:57.220 --> 01:02:00.420
so much anymore after the shows because-

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:02.180
Yeah, not during these tours.

01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:04.100
It's gonna be real tight.

01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:06.420
It's just tough, cause we have shows every day,

01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:09.220
so we kinda have to go back and sleep

01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:10.820
and then drive the next day.

01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:13.940
So we probably won't be hanging out after those,

01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:15.540
which I only mentioned because I don't want people

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:18.020
to wait around thinking that we're gonna be popping out

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:19.780
to sign stuff, and I'm sorry about that.

01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:22.020
But also, we're traveling with families and stuff,

01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:27.020
and it gets really tricky to keep everybody there so late.

01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:31.460
So that is the deal with that, just so y'all know.

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:33.700
I also wanted to let everybody know,

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:36.820
here in Cincinnati at the Noh Theater of Cincinnati,

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:41.780
I am, starting in November, teaching a weekly class

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:44.340
about podcasting called Podcast 101.

01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:47.300
And so even if you're not in Cincinnati,

01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:49.460
and it is already sold out in Cincinnati,

01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:51.700
but we're also going to be videotaping it

01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:56.660
and then sending links to the videos to people who sign up.

01:02:56.660 --> 01:03:01.540
It's $100 for six hour and a half long videos

01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:02.740
about podcasting.

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:05.780
If you're interested in checking out the details,

01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:06.980
and maybe signing up,

01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:11.980
you can go to bit.ly forward slash podcast 101 video

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:15.220
and sign up for it there.

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:17.860
Let's see, what else?

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:19.700
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:20.660
for the use of our theme song,

01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:22.900
It's a Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:24.580
John has been kind enough to let us use that song

01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:26.260
for like six years now,

01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:28.260
and I cannot imagine our show without it.

01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:31.060
So thank you, John and the Long Winters.

01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:32.820
Oh, along with sending in Yahoo's,

01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:33.700
if you're gonna be at the shows,

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:35.300
make sure you send in regular questions.

01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:36.260
Send regular questions too,

01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:40.740
and put in the subject which show you're going to be at,

01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:43.780
so we can sort them easier.

01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:45.380
I don't think I've ever promoted this on here,

01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:50.340
but Justin and I, and Travis pops in a lot too.

01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:51.780
We do videos for Polygon.

01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:53.620
If you go to polygon.com slash YouTube,

01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:55.660
you can check out all of the different videos

01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:56.500
that we do there.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.660
Justin and I have a series called Monster Factory.

01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:00.780
We play Player Unknown's Battlegrounds every Tuesday.

01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:02.340
We live stream it for like a couple hours,

01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:04.660
and Travis usually joins in in a series called Awful Squad.

01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:06.980
You can watch like a bunch of archived videos of that.

01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:09.380
It's a very, very fun little series.

01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:11.660
And that link is also youtube.com slash Polygon,

01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:13.300
not the inverted one that Griffin just said.

01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:14.180
What did I say?

01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:15.700
Polygon.com slash YouTube?

01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:16.540
Yeah.

01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:17.380
Oops, that's not right.

01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:19.420
Yeah, youtube.com slash Polygon.

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:20.940
Yeah, so how about that final?

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:21.860
Wait, I have one more thing.

01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:23.140
I just remembered, quick.

01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:25.540
If you're in Cincinnati or the Cincinnati area,

01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:30.540
my friends and I are organizing a puzzle-themed pub crawl

01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:35.020
where you go from bar to bar and solve puzzles

01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:38.420
and get points and compete and that kind of thing.

01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:40.820
We've got one coming up September 12th.

01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:42.220
If you would like to check out all the details,

01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:45.860
you can go to puzzlecrawl.com and sign up.

01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:48.900
This final one was sent in by Morgan Davey.

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:50.020
Keep it wavy, Morgan Davey.

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:52.860
It's Yahoo Answers user anonymous.

01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:54.000
Timothy Allen asks,

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:59.920
is fidget spinner masculine or feminine in Spanish?

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:03.260
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:04.420
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:06.140
I'm a wisecracking kid who came from the Midwest

01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:08.620
looking for answers to my question for McElroy.

01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:10.860
This has been My Brother, My Brother Made Kiss Your Dad.

01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:12.140
Square on the lips.

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:18.140
Hey girls, do you wanna just say hey I wanna?

01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:18.980
I wanna.

01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:31.100
Maximumfun.org.

01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:34.860
Comedy and culture, artist-owned, listener-supported.

01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:36.260
Going into a bullseye interview,

01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:39.220
I know it's somebody who does amazing work,

01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:40.760
but it's an actual conversation.

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:42.260
I don't know where it's headed.

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:45.780
Absolutely, you're absolutely right.

01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:47.340
You said it actually better than I did,

01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:49.600
so I have to think about what that means.

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:50.440
Hmm.

01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:53.700
Hey, this is the straight talk

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:55.340
that you're gonna get on this show.
