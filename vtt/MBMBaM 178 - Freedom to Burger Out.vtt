WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:49.040
Welcome, my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:50.240 --> 00:55.680
We are here. During the Thanksgiving holiday, we repurposed our program

00:55.680 --> 01:02.720
to serve as basically just a turkey advice show. We work in conjunction with Butterball,

01:02.720 --> 01:07.280
sort of their podcasting arm. Who fired their entire customer service department,

01:07.280 --> 01:11.040
which I thought not only goes against the holiday spirit, it kind of goes against the

01:11.040 --> 01:15.040
whole Butterball ethos. I'll say this, you know, as I was going through the questions,

01:15.040 --> 01:20.240
you know what I wasn't expecting? What? So many questions about fucking the turkey.

01:20.240 --> 01:25.440
Yeah. Yeah, a lot of those are people trying to get like a rise out of trying to like,

01:25.440 --> 01:31.600
goof the goofsters. Yeah, but I would say that 10% of them were really graphically detailed.

01:31.600 --> 01:35.920
Sure. Well, they were like, where do I put it in? And it's like, I don't know. How about the

01:35.920 --> 01:40.560
giant cavity, you stupid idiot? Like you're clearly just fucking with us at this point.

01:40.560 --> 01:46.320
And the turkey. We've since we got laid off from Butterball, we have a lot of turkey advice build

01:46.320 --> 01:50.080
up. Let's go around, introduce ourselves and just say how we cooked our turkeys this year.

01:50.880 --> 01:55.280
My name is Justin McElroy. I'm the oldest brother on this program. This year I went

01:55.280 --> 02:01.440
with a nice sun-dried turkey. It's a little dicey to get the procedure exactly right.

02:01.440 --> 02:04.400
You got to leave it in the sun and then you'll wait.

02:04.400 --> 02:04.960
For how long?

02:05.920 --> 02:07.360
Enough. You'll know.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.080
Until the little thing pops.

02:10.080 --> 02:12.960
Until the little thing pops out. It usually takes about a day.

02:12.960 --> 02:16.160
The belly button. A day is not nearly long enough.

02:16.160 --> 02:18.560
You're not going to want to eat it. That's the other thing.

02:19.200 --> 02:22.640
My name is Travis McElroy. I'm the middle-est brother and I sat on it.

02:23.760 --> 02:24.720
You incubated it.

02:24.720 --> 02:27.200
I incubated it for 16 days.

02:29.280 --> 02:30.640
My name is Griffin McElroy.

02:30.640 --> 02:33.040
Also, that turkey ended up tasting of farts.

02:33.040 --> 02:34.080
Yeah, I bet.

02:34.080 --> 02:36.080
You just really wanted to say farts today.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.280
Farts, farts, farts.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.920
You guys haven't heard because this is our third stab at trying to start the show,

02:39.920 --> 02:43.680
but Travis has tried to incorporate farts into each attempt.

02:43.680 --> 02:48.160
Well, my offer, our intro should just be us farting into the microphones for three minutes.

02:48.160 --> 02:52.000
It's kind of a dry week, so that might impress upon the rest of the episode.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.720
My name is Griffin McElroy and I just tormented a live turkey for like a year.

02:58.080 --> 03:00.320
I built a dungeon, a turkey dungeon.

03:00.960 --> 03:03.760
Then I would go in there every day around noon.

03:04.400 --> 03:07.920
You got to have it be at a regular time so the turkey knows that it's coming.

03:09.120 --> 03:11.920
Then I just terrorized it.

03:11.920 --> 03:19.520
Then eventually it basted in its own terror and that is how you get a good brine on a turkey.

03:19.520 --> 03:23.440
You can really taste the begrudging acceptance that his

03:23.440 --> 03:26.000
turkey wife has probably remarried and moved on with her life.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.800
That really comes through in the meat.

03:28.800 --> 03:35.920
And then I teach him to love me and then I get him to hunt, kill,

03:35.920 --> 03:38.080
and cook other turkeys, Homeland, season four,

03:38.080 --> 03:40.480
catch it on Blu-ray and DVD, get the full collection.

03:42.240 --> 03:43.840
Turkey Claire Danes is great.

03:43.840 --> 03:46.640
She is just all over the place.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.000
Very dynamic performance.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.920
So wait, you're saying that.

03:50.880 --> 03:53.280
I'm saying I recreated Homeland season four

03:53.280 --> 03:55.440
because there's no way they're going to make it there without my help.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.360
Only it's all turkeys.

03:58.160 --> 04:00.400
I found a turkey that looks a lot like Claire Danes.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.480
Found a turkey that looks a lot like Mandy Patinkin.

04:02.480 --> 04:04.160
That was not as hard as you think it would be.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.040
And then I shoot the show in my backyard.

04:07.680 --> 04:11.360
And the turkey is turned against, is weaponized against other turkeys.

04:11.360 --> 04:14.000
He's an Uncle Tom, he's an Uncle Tom turkey.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.320
Can you not like, did you not follow along?

04:16.320 --> 04:18.880
I know, I guess it is kind of a confusing show, but.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.120
When did you find time to eat?

04:22.640 --> 04:23.760
I didn't, I guess.

04:23.760 --> 04:25.840
That's the life of a big Hollywood producer, you know.

04:25.840 --> 04:29.760
So you just blew right past Thanksgiving and the turkeys were spared

04:29.760 --> 04:32.960
because of your involvement in their creative process?

04:32.960 --> 04:35.920
Well, I mean, we got to take them at least to sweeps

04:35.920 --> 04:38.960
and then we'll see if we can get like season five, season six.

04:38.960 --> 04:41.760
This is how this fucking business works, Travis.

04:41.760 --> 04:43.920
Okay, you know, I'm new to it.

04:43.920 --> 04:48.480
I didn't know there was so much starvation involved in turkey eating.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.280
I've been looking at a lot of pictures of turkeys

04:53.280 --> 04:57.840
in the build up to this bit, this classic, sure to be classic bit.

04:57.840 --> 05:02.160
And something occurred to me that distinguishes turkeys

05:02.720 --> 05:09.520
is that they are the only animal that looks delicious in their natural form.

05:09.520 --> 05:11.200
I don't think that's true at all.

05:11.200 --> 05:14.480
Now, if you look at a picture of a turkey, right?

05:14.480 --> 05:17.360
If you just say, I'm going to look at a turkey today

05:17.360 --> 05:21.280
and then you go to like a Google image search and just search for turkey

05:21.280 --> 05:26.560
and tell me if they don't look like they are just flaunting the meat.

05:26.560 --> 05:30.240
I actually think they look like they have ball bag heads

05:30.240 --> 05:32.400
with ball bags underneath their heads

05:32.400 --> 05:35.040
and then their whole body is kind of a ball bag.

05:35.040 --> 05:38.480
Kind of an overlapping series of scrote.

05:38.480 --> 05:42.320
Some of the animals you have to work to imagine how you might eat them.

05:42.320 --> 05:45.680
And I feel like the turkey really has it on display.

05:45.680 --> 05:46.720
Like, check it out.

05:46.720 --> 05:48.160
You know where you're going to eat me.

05:48.160 --> 05:50.400
But its head looks like a penis.

05:51.440 --> 05:54.320
Obviously the head is like clearly labeled not for eating though.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.040
This is what I'm saying.

05:55.040 --> 05:55.840
It's convenient.

05:55.840 --> 05:57.200
It's like a pull tab.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.960
You know, like definitely don't eat this.

05:58.960 --> 06:00.400
It's obvious you don't want to eat this.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.480
And the tail looks like a beautiful fan.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.400
So you don't want to eat that, obvs.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.400
But then the rest of it just looks delicious.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.560
Like it's obviously you want to eat it.

06:08.560 --> 06:09.840
I can't go here with you, Juice.

06:10.400 --> 06:11.760
Oh man, I love turkey.

06:12.480 --> 06:13.760
How about a question?

06:13.760 --> 06:15.440
Yeah, here's a question.

06:15.440 --> 06:16.400
Turkey?

06:16.400 --> 06:17.360
Okay, how about another one?

06:17.360 --> 06:19.200
Now let me rephrase that as a question.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.160
Turkey?

06:20.160 --> 06:20.400
Turkey?

06:20.400 --> 06:20.960
Okay, that's better.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.120
That's a little bit better.

06:23.120 --> 06:24.000
Um, hold on.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.480
I'm just scrolling through all of the turkey questions.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.000
And beating it to some that aren't.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.160
No, I'm not, sir.

06:31.360 --> 06:32.080
Sir.

06:32.080 --> 06:36.800
Gift giving season is here and in an effort to find some sweet deals,

06:36.800 --> 06:39.840
I came across some good quality refurbished electronics.

06:39.840 --> 06:43.360
Is it socially acceptable to give somebody a refurbished item

06:43.360 --> 06:46.800
or would I be committing a social taboo of the highest order?

06:46.800 --> 06:48.000
And that's from Joey.

06:49.680 --> 06:51.280
I'm huge into refurbished.

06:51.280 --> 06:54.320
I think that's great because you're keeping something out of a landfill.

06:54.320 --> 06:57.520
You know, you're not creating more waste.

06:57.520 --> 06:58.720
Captain Planet.

06:58.720 --> 07:01.280
I've been thinking about this question for a bit now.

07:01.280 --> 07:04.400
And, um, as somebody who used to work at GameStop,

07:05.520 --> 07:08.320
I actually am a lot more hesitant about this prospect

07:08.320 --> 07:12.640
because I have some fucking horror stories that would turn your hair white.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.760
About refurbished electronics?

07:15.760 --> 07:17.040
About refurbished electronics.

07:17.040 --> 07:19.440
Do you know, let's play a quick guessing game.

07:19.440 --> 07:24.720
Of all the PlayStation Portables, Sony's classic handheld gaming device

07:24.720 --> 07:27.360
that were turned into our store for trade-in credit,

07:27.360 --> 07:32.160
uh, how many were chock-loaded with the butt-slammin'-est porn

07:33.440 --> 07:35.200
you've ever dreamt of?

07:35.200 --> 07:36.240
Not enough.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.840
Did you say a hundred percent?

07:38.800 --> 07:39.760
Congratulations.

07:39.760 --> 07:43.280
There were certain devices that was just like,

07:43.280 --> 07:45.680
obviously anything with any sort of hard drive

07:45.680 --> 07:47.920
that you can download multimedia content to,

07:48.640 --> 07:50.960
that also had a screen on it,

07:51.760 --> 07:54.720
which people turn it into like the PlayStation butt-slam.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.560
Three thousand, I'm at it.

07:56.560 --> 07:57.840
But, Griffin, so you're concerned,

07:57.840 --> 08:00.800
because when you refurbish it, you also reformat it, right?

08:00.800 --> 08:02.400
You're not handing it back to-

08:02.400 --> 08:06.960
Yeah, but to reformat it, I had to press the button, right,

08:06.960 --> 08:08.960
and scroll to the thing in the menu.

08:08.960 --> 08:10.560
And guess what it always, like,

08:10.560 --> 08:14.080
before I could get to that old user interface,

08:14.080 --> 08:19.520
I saw a fucking butt with a man's like whole head in it, like-

08:19.520 --> 08:22.560
So your concern would be that you would be re-gifting someone

08:22.560 --> 08:24.160
a refurbished game console?

08:24.160 --> 08:26.560
A refurbished device that at some point

08:26.560 --> 08:28.640
someone had used to bait it?

08:28.640 --> 08:30.560
Haunted by the ghost of baiting.

08:30.560 --> 08:35.440
What if the sales associate had not been as diligent as I was?

08:36.320 --> 08:39.040
Guys, like, there was this one time this dude came in,

08:39.040 --> 08:40.720
and he handed in his PlayStation 4,

08:40.720 --> 08:41.680
like, I'd like to trade this in.

08:41.680 --> 08:43.520
I was like, I can't wait to see what's on this shit.

08:43.520 --> 08:47.120
And he actually said, make sure you check out

08:47.120 --> 08:48.160
some of the stuff I got on there.

08:48.160 --> 08:49.520
I think you're really gonna like it.

08:49.520 --> 08:50.720
He actually told me that.

08:50.720 --> 08:55.600
And it was, like, it was just asses for days.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.880
It was gigabytes upon gigabytes of gigabytes.

08:58.880 --> 09:01.600
I wish I could have been in the car with somebody

09:01.600 --> 09:04.960
who had just dropped off a porn-loaded PlayStation,

09:04.960 --> 09:07.360
because they'd be having that discussion in their head, like,

09:07.360 --> 09:09.760
no, I've formatted it, didn't I?

09:09.760 --> 09:12.080
Better point is that they reach over

09:12.080 --> 09:14.320
and they pick up the other PSP they have,

09:14.320 --> 09:15.680
and they're like, wait, wait, wait,

09:15.680 --> 09:16.800
none of my porn's on you.

09:16.800 --> 09:17.920
Oh, no.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.760
This is my Crash Bandicoot one.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.120
Crash Bandicoot one.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.720
I turned in the wrong one.

09:22.720 --> 09:23.680
Damn it.

09:23.680 --> 09:24.520
God damn it.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.240
Travis stepped all over my funny bit.

09:26.240 --> 09:27.200
Sorry, go ahead, Justin.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.960
I'd been waiting to do this funny bit

09:28.960 --> 09:31.520
while you guys talked about your stuff.

09:31.520 --> 09:32.360
Do it.

09:32.360 --> 09:33.200
Travis stepped all over it.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.120
He said, no, I've got a different bit I'm gonna do.

09:35.120 --> 09:36.560
It was very rude.

09:36.560 --> 09:39.360
Can you give me a basic rundown

09:39.360 --> 09:40.960
of what your bit would have been?

09:40.960 --> 09:46.160
You want me to recap my bit for you?

09:46.160 --> 09:49.040
Well, now I feel bad, and I feel like I'll always wonder.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.880
Last time, Justin's bit.

09:50.880 --> 09:51.720
I feel bad, too,

09:51.720 --> 09:54.040
because I feel like I contributed to the bit chomping,

09:54.040 --> 09:58.200
and so I need to know if the guilt is justified,

09:58.200 --> 10:00.560
if your bit was actually any good or not.

10:00.560 --> 10:03.720
Okay, so basically what was gonna happen

10:03.720 --> 10:06.320
was that the guy in the fictional car

10:06.320 --> 10:10.800
was gonna be like, I must've deleted it,

10:10.800 --> 10:13.440
and then he was gonna be like, oh, I'm sure I did,

10:13.440 --> 10:17.080
and then he would slowly have the realization.

10:17.080 --> 10:18.400
You know what the bit was about?

10:18.400 --> 10:20.360
It was about human foibles.

10:21.760 --> 10:25.520
It really would've cast a light, a very human light.

10:25.520 --> 10:27.480
I think that's something everybody can relate to.

10:27.480 --> 10:28.760
Travis is exonerated.

10:28.760 --> 10:30.920
B, I feel like everybody sort of got

10:30.920 --> 10:34.800
where the bit was going from the start of it.

10:34.800 --> 10:35.840
That's the problem, though.

10:35.840 --> 10:38.400
Why do you think we're so chock full of bits

10:38.400 --> 10:41.860
that we can afford to just leapfrog bit to bit

10:41.860 --> 10:44.560
and not just cling to every one for dear life?

10:44.560 --> 10:47.620
This is episode 178 or something.

10:47.620 --> 10:49.080
The listeners are super busy,

10:49.080 --> 10:52.560
and if we can deliver unto them a bit in five seconds,

10:52.560 --> 10:55.720
and then they can fill out the other solid 25 seconds

10:55.720 --> 10:57.800
of material in their own minds

10:57.800 --> 11:01.800
while we swing from vine to vine like joke Tarzan,

11:01.800 --> 11:03.520
I don't think there's any problem with that.

11:03.520 --> 11:04.640
Guys, guys.

11:04.640 --> 11:05.480
Yeah.

11:05.480 --> 11:06.840
Refurbish bits.

11:07.680 --> 11:08.520
Okay.

11:08.520 --> 11:11.640
This is how we keep it going for another 178 episodes.

11:11.640 --> 11:14.400
So let's bring back, we can bring back Torcy.

11:14.400 --> 11:17.120
We can bring back ghosts.

11:17.120 --> 11:18.640
That's always a good refurbish bit.

11:18.640 --> 11:20.420
Yeah, this is shit we already do, Travis.

11:20.420 --> 11:22.880
This isn't like, oh, let's talk about ghosts and horses

11:22.880 --> 11:24.880
a bunch, like that's it, that's our show.

11:24.880 --> 11:25.720
We are doing that.

11:25.720 --> 11:27.520
We've been refurbishing bits.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.360
I see.

11:28.360 --> 11:29.480
At least the dozens of episodes.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.480
What about refurbish Furbies?

11:31.480 --> 11:32.800
Refurbies.

11:32.800 --> 11:33.840
Refurbies?

11:34.800 --> 11:36.080
I don't have a rest of that.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.320
I just think that that's a really funny word.

11:37.320 --> 11:38.840
Do you guys know that Furbies

11:38.840 --> 11:41.960
are still like regularly popping off?

11:41.960 --> 11:45.400
And I feel like Furbies are only distinguished by their,

11:45.400 --> 11:47.240
you remember there was that one Christmas

11:47.240 --> 11:49.160
where forget about it.

11:49.160 --> 11:51.000
Like you had to get it.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.140
If you didn't have a Furby under the tree,

11:53.140 --> 11:55.400
you should leave your parent card.

11:55.400 --> 11:56.920
I got Harrow.

11:58.640 --> 11:59.480
You got Harrow?

11:59.480 --> 12:00.300
Was that?

12:00.300 --> 12:02.920
Harrow was the off-brand Furby

12:02.920 --> 12:06.120
for parents that maybe had kind of a tough year.

12:06.120 --> 12:06.960
That was the tagline.

12:06.960 --> 12:07.800
Hey.

12:10.440 --> 12:11.760
Did you have a tough year?

12:11.760 --> 12:13.080
Because they understand.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.960
No, it's okay.

12:14.960 --> 12:16.760
I'm good enough.

12:16.760 --> 12:18.080
Yay.

12:18.080 --> 12:19.360
This is what Harrow would say.

12:19.360 --> 12:23.640
He would say things like he can't tell the difference.

12:25.240 --> 12:28.560
Really, the other parents are just paying for a brand name.

12:28.560 --> 12:30.440
Listen, I'm a smart boy.

12:30.440 --> 12:31.480
Things like that just to make you like.

12:31.480 --> 12:32.320
I remember that Harrow.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.400
You named him Jim Belushi, didn't you?

12:34.400 --> 12:35.720
I named him Jim Belushi,

12:35.720 --> 12:38.760
and one day he disappeared.

12:38.760 --> 12:41.120
Next thing I know, he's on TV.

12:42.280 --> 12:43.120
He had his own show.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.240
Or agents.

12:45.240 --> 12:46.640
I was, of course, suggesting you named him

12:46.640 --> 12:48.800
after the secondhand Belushi,

12:48.800 --> 12:50.640
but you are instead suggesting

12:50.640 --> 12:53.700
that you were gifted Jim Belushi, the actor,

12:53.700 --> 12:55.200
and you gave him his start.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.140
You have to be careful.

12:56.140 --> 12:57.480
You can't get him wet.

12:57.480 --> 12:59.080
You can't feed him after midnight,

12:59.080 --> 13:00.920
or else he's gonna start his own shitty TV show.

13:00.920 --> 13:03.200
That was definitely, definitely on Harrow's instruction.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.920
For Christ's sake, don't let him near a harmonica.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.360
That'll be your whole day.

13:08.360 --> 13:09.920
How about a Yahoo Griffin?

13:09.920 --> 13:10.740
Okay.

13:10.740 --> 13:11.580
Oh.

13:12.980 --> 13:14.260
Coffee break, okay?

13:14.260 --> 13:16.260
This Yahoo is sent in by Ashley Burgart.

13:16.260 --> 13:17.100
Thanks, Ashley.

13:17.100 --> 13:20.180
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Big C, who asks,

13:20.180 --> 13:21.660
should there be limits set

13:21.660 --> 13:24.860
for how much can be ordered at fast food drive-throughs?

13:26.380 --> 13:28.300
It seems like I am always getting behind some van

13:28.300 --> 13:30.620
that is ordering like 10 combos.

13:30.620 --> 13:32.120
I don't think this should be allowed.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.980
People with huge orders should be denied

13:33.980 --> 13:36.700
drive-through service and made to place orders inside.

13:36.700 --> 13:39.100
It is unfair to those of us using the drive-through

13:39.100 --> 13:41.940
for its intended purpose to get our food quickly.

13:41.940 --> 13:42.860
I see a drive-through

13:42.860 --> 13:45.460
as kind of like a supermarket express lane.

13:45.460 --> 13:46.740
Order limits should be set

13:46.740 --> 13:49.040
for it to keep its lines steady moving.

13:49.980 --> 13:51.760
Sometimes I read questions on this show

13:51.760 --> 13:54.060
just because they make a lot of fucking sense.

13:54.060 --> 13:58.220
Yeah, this guy's got some fucking good ideas.

13:58.220 --> 13:59.940
I don't, okay, I have a problem

13:59.940 --> 14:02.060
with the premise of his question though,

14:02.060 --> 14:07.060
because I don't think anyone is gonna go inside Arby's

14:07.060 --> 14:10.620
because they wanna soak it in.

14:10.620 --> 14:11.460
Oh, you could have just.

14:11.460 --> 14:13.260
I have to prolong this experience.

14:13.260 --> 14:16.060
In this day and age of drive-through convenience,

14:16.060 --> 14:19.420
who eats in the restaurant?

14:20.980 --> 14:23.820
Our local Arby's and Wendy's has a lot of seating in it,

14:23.820 --> 14:26.380
and it is so confusing to me.

14:26.380 --> 14:29.140
The idea that you would say,

14:29.140 --> 14:32.460
I know where I wanna eat, inside Arby's.

14:32.460 --> 14:36.020
I wanna go into Arby's and sit in there.

14:36.020 --> 14:38.140
And listen, you can make the argument and say like,

14:38.140 --> 14:40.860
well, maybe you have time to kill before a flight

14:40.860 --> 14:41.940
or before you have to be somewhere

14:41.940 --> 14:43.260
and you're not from around there.

14:43.260 --> 14:46.060
Okay, great, get the food and go to a park.

14:46.060 --> 14:48.420
Get the food and go literally anywhere else.

14:48.420 --> 14:49.740
Shut your trash.

14:49.740 --> 14:52.220
Go get your food and go to a park.

14:52.220 --> 14:54.920
You'll be the guy eating Arby's in the park?

14:54.920 --> 14:55.900
Yeah.

14:56.900 --> 14:58.000
That's a good look.

14:58.000 --> 14:58.840
A guy at Arby's has that.

14:58.840 --> 15:01.280
Ooh, get your Arby's and go to a Wendy's.

15:01.280 --> 15:06.280
When you go to Arby's, Arby's tagline is,

15:08.040 --> 15:09.840
hey, you got five minutes?

15:09.840 --> 15:11.380
Because you have five minutes

15:11.380 --> 15:13.640
that you need to refill the old food tank

15:13.640 --> 15:14.920
as fast as you possibly can

15:14.920 --> 15:17.240
because you have plans in seven minutes.

15:17.240 --> 15:18.980
Nobody goes to Arby's and is like,

15:18.980 --> 15:21.600
what is the best possible venue

15:21.600 --> 15:23.560
that I can eat this food in?

15:23.560 --> 15:26.720
Can I get seconds on these onion dippers

15:26.720 --> 15:29.200
because I am just enjoying the ambiance.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.840
This is not a classism.

15:30.840 --> 15:32.920
I'm not saying like.

15:32.920 --> 15:35.200
We do seem to hate on Arby's a lot though.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.040
No.

15:36.040 --> 15:37.880
Have you guys noticed how it's always Arby's?

15:37.880 --> 15:39.480
Is Arby's just the funniest?

15:39.480 --> 15:40.960
I think Arby's is a funny name,

15:40.960 --> 15:42.800
but also I'll go to an Arby's

15:42.800 --> 15:44.040
so I don't feel bad about it.

15:44.040 --> 15:48.520
I went to Arby's two days ago to get some grub.

15:48.520 --> 15:49.480
I get it.

15:49.480 --> 15:50.640
Good mood food.

15:50.640 --> 15:51.480
Mighty Minis.

15:51.480 --> 15:52.920
They're delicious and new.

15:52.920 --> 15:53.760
But.

15:53.760 --> 15:55.320
Tell me more.

15:55.320 --> 15:57.320
Okay, so they got two little things

15:57.320 --> 15:59.000
and they're on Hawaiian buns

15:59.000 --> 16:02.680
and they're two little sandwiches with roast beef

16:02.680 --> 16:04.000
and they have crispy onions on them

16:04.000 --> 16:05.220
and then some like a.

16:05.220 --> 16:06.060
Ooh.

16:06.060 --> 16:06.880
I don't know.

16:06.880 --> 16:07.720
It's like a flavor sauce.

16:07.720 --> 16:08.560
I really don't know what the sauce is.

16:08.560 --> 16:09.380
So sort of like Slammers.

16:09.380 --> 16:10.220
Slammers with roast beef.

16:10.220 --> 16:11.380
They're like little Slammers.

16:11.380 --> 16:12.220
Anyway.

16:12.220 --> 16:13.040
But it's like a little.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.040
What kind of meat?

16:14.040 --> 16:14.960
Oh, roast beef.

16:14.960 --> 16:15.780
Roasted beef.

16:15.780 --> 16:16.620
You dumb fucking.

16:16.620 --> 16:18.680
It's really hoping it's gonna be pulled pork

16:18.680 --> 16:21.740
because I associate pulled pork with the Hawaiian rolls.

16:21.740 --> 16:22.580
No, no, no.

16:22.580 --> 16:23.600
It's a roasted beef.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.400
Anyway, I just don't know.

16:25.400 --> 16:26.240
If you have.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.620
The only context I can see is

16:28.620 --> 16:30.860
if you have kids and you're like,

16:30.860 --> 16:33.260
I cannot be in a car with these children anymore.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.260
Like I have to put them in a place

16:35.260 --> 16:37.760
where I can get them out of my field of view.

16:37.760 --> 16:38.600
I get that.

16:38.600 --> 16:39.440
I understand that.

16:39.440 --> 16:40.920
But if you're just by yourself,

16:40.920 --> 16:42.440
you have to know how much you're gonna upset

16:42.440 --> 16:43.800
other people who will see you.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.640
What if I'm driving through the drive-thru

16:45.640 --> 16:47.540
and I am driving past the window

16:47.540 --> 16:49.760
and I see a man doing a Sudoku

16:49.760 --> 16:52.080
and eating a Mighty Mini out of the corner of my eye

16:52.080 --> 16:53.200
and we make eye contact.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.760
That's my entire day.

16:54.760 --> 16:55.600
You know, you're forgetting.

16:55.600 --> 16:56.600
I was thinking about that guy.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.820
You're forgetting.

16:57.820 --> 16:59.460
Some of these places have free wifi.

16:59.460 --> 17:02.080
Whenever I drive past a McDonald's,

17:02.080 --> 17:05.240
it is illuminated by so many MacBook Air screens

17:05.240 --> 17:08.040
of people, you know, getting some files.

17:08.040 --> 17:11.200
You're also forgetting McDonald's birthday parties.

17:11.200 --> 17:12.600
That is true.

17:12.600 --> 17:14.160
You play the game where you put the straw up to your nose

17:14.160 --> 17:16.120
and you try and jump it and drop it in the cup.

17:16.120 --> 17:17.400
You get in the plate place for a little while,

17:17.400 --> 17:19.000
get a good static buildup.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.440
Was it a common thing that the McDonald's birthday parties

17:22.440 --> 17:24.520
making games out of like.

17:24.520 --> 17:25.880
McDonald's shit.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.800
Oh yeah, like Depression era children

17:27.800 --> 17:31.840
at like fashion games out of whatever was available.

17:31.840 --> 17:33.400
There was one where you had to stock,

17:33.400 --> 17:36.000
stack as many Filet-O-Fish boxes on top.

17:36.000 --> 17:36.840
I remember that.

17:36.840 --> 17:37.660
We have video of that.

17:37.660 --> 17:38.500
Sure.

17:38.500 --> 17:40.680
I feel like that might not have been a McDonald's policy.

17:40.680 --> 17:42.080
That might've just been dad being like,

17:42.080 --> 17:43.560
well, this birthday's shitty.

17:43.560 --> 17:45.320
All right, give me those Filet-O-Fish boxes.

17:45.320 --> 17:47.100
Here's the game kids, stack them.

17:47.100 --> 17:47.940
I don't know what you're talking about.

17:47.940 --> 17:50.600
That was the best birthday that I've ever had in my life.

17:52.160 --> 17:56.440
Man, there are some people in Yahoo Answers

17:56.440 --> 18:01.120
that are just fucking furious about this idea.

18:01.120 --> 18:02.480
What do they have to say?

18:03.920 --> 18:07.280
No, lotto's.

18:07.280 --> 18:08.560
This is a free country.

18:08.560 --> 18:10.560
That would be taking away rights.

18:10.560 --> 18:11.400
Oh my God.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.220
What right?

18:12.220 --> 18:13.480
Excuse me, pardon me.

18:13.480 --> 18:15.480
What legal right does that take away?

18:15.480 --> 18:17.220
Is that freedom of expression?

18:17.220 --> 18:19.120
Is that right to bear arms?

18:19.120 --> 18:22.440
Is that right to refuse army quarter?

18:22.440 --> 18:24.440
Freedom to burger out.

18:24.440 --> 18:25.800
That would be taking away rights.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.960
I don't care if you're buying 1000 cheeseburgers.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.560
You don't care?

18:30.560 --> 18:33.040
You don't care if I buy 1000 cheeseburgers?

18:33.040 --> 18:36.120
Let me read the source because the source is social studies.

18:38.640 --> 18:39.940
What's up now?

18:39.940 --> 18:41.280
This person talks a big game,

18:41.280 --> 18:43.680
but I think if they were at Arby's,

18:43.680 --> 18:47.180
they have five and a half minutes to get this shit

18:47.180 --> 18:49.840
from pulling into the drive through

18:49.840 --> 18:52.880
to consuming every last calorie.

18:52.880 --> 18:54.320
And then someone in front of them is like,

18:54.320 --> 18:57.600
hi, I need one, two, three, four, five,

18:57.600 --> 18:59.240
1000 cheeseburgers, please.

18:59.240 --> 19:01.240
And they're like, well, that's going to take us.

19:01.240 --> 19:02.880
It's going to take us a couple of days.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.520
Because we don't sell cheeseburgers.

19:04.520 --> 19:06.120
Person behind was like, well, this isn't ideal,

19:06.120 --> 19:07.840
but I don't want to infringe on this person's rights

19:07.840 --> 19:10.100
because I learned not to in social studies.

19:10.100 --> 19:11.640
Can I just say I have a bigger problem

19:11.640 --> 19:12.740
when I'm in the fast food line

19:12.740 --> 19:14.480
and it is not the size of the order,

19:14.480 --> 19:18.040
but it's the time to take when they order the order.

19:18.040 --> 19:19.640
I got stuck behind a woman at rallies,

19:19.640 --> 19:22.040
which already I wasn't super proud of myself,

19:22.040 --> 19:25.520
but she went through like 10 different items

19:25.520 --> 19:29.240
asking what came on it and like wanting a breakdown

19:29.240 --> 19:31.880
of the ingredient list and like the care

19:31.880 --> 19:32.720
that would be taken creating the thing.

19:32.720 --> 19:33.960
Where was this at?

19:33.960 --> 19:34.880
At the rallies.

19:34.880 --> 19:36.560
Well, rallies is just kind of an off brand.

19:36.560 --> 19:38.400
It's not really one of the big three.

19:38.400 --> 19:39.760
It's not the one you go to.

19:39.760 --> 19:42.240
I imagine that this is probably this person's first time

19:42.240 --> 19:43.080
at a rallies.

19:43.080 --> 19:44.800
Maybe they've even been to a Checkers before

19:44.800 --> 19:46.640
and they don't know about the regional differences.

19:46.640 --> 19:47.680
There are a lot of questions.

19:47.680 --> 19:50.160
Rallies is a fair place to inquire

19:50.160 --> 19:51.200
about those kinds of things.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.920
The hard thing is you might actually create a deficit

19:53.920 --> 19:56.100
by buying a thousand cheeseburgers.

19:56.100 --> 20:01.100
I went to Wendy's, this was three days ago I think,

20:02.160 --> 20:05.460
and I was in line and when I got to the window,

20:05.460 --> 20:09.600
the gentleman told me, we don't have any beef right now.

20:09.600 --> 20:12.920
You have to pull up and wait a few minutes.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.640
I was at Wendy's and they didn't have hamburgers ready.

20:15.640 --> 20:17.520
From my reaction to this gentleman,

20:17.520 --> 20:20.840
you would have thought that I was in Soviet Russia.

20:20.840 --> 20:24.080
I could not believe that here in this great land,

20:24.080 --> 20:26.640
I was being told I had to wait on a hamburger.

20:26.640 --> 20:28.360
I get it if I'm getting chicken strips.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.080
You may not have those handy.

20:30.080 --> 20:31.560
I understand that.

20:31.560 --> 20:35.240
I had a weird fast food experience

20:35.240 --> 20:36.160
that I wanted to touch on.

20:36.160 --> 20:37.640
Can I ask if it was funny at all

20:37.640 --> 20:39.520
before we jump into it with both people?

20:39.520 --> 20:41.240
It was more bewildering.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.800
Well then it may be not right for the show.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.200
But I would like to say it.

20:45.200 --> 20:48.900
I've been trying to work through it.

20:48.900 --> 20:52.560
You can say it, we'll try and find the humor.

20:52.560 --> 20:54.880
Maybe it'll be like a little slice of life type of humor

20:54.880 --> 20:56.360
like they do on Prairie Home Companion.

20:56.360 --> 20:58.720
But I don't want you to just tell a story

20:58.720 --> 20:59.720
because it's really not that kind of podcast.

20:59.720 --> 21:00.960
I can do it really fast.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.960
Put it through your Dave Barry filter, Travis.

21:02.960 --> 21:04.400
Take the slice of life moment

21:04.400 --> 21:06.880
and then tell it as American humorist

21:06.880 --> 21:09.280
and national treasure Dave Barry would tell it.

21:10.640 --> 21:13.720
No, I pulled up to the Wendy's

21:13.720 --> 21:17.160
and there was a dude standing next to the screen

21:17.160 --> 21:20.160
where you order and he like knocked on my window

21:20.160 --> 21:21.000
and I rolled it down.

21:21.000 --> 21:21.820
He's like, what are you going to have?

21:21.820 --> 21:23.600
And then he talked into his headset

21:23.600 --> 21:24.480
and all I could think was,

21:24.480 --> 21:26.600
oh, this is some kind of weird Wendy scam

21:26.600 --> 21:28.840
where he's pretending he's going to take my money.

21:28.840 --> 21:31.720
And he was like, okay, pull up to the window.

21:31.720 --> 21:32.560
And then I got up to the screen.

21:32.560 --> 21:34.400
He was working for bootleg Wendy.

21:34.400 --> 21:36.400
I guess I got to the screen

21:36.400 --> 21:38.240
and realized I'd forgotten to order something.

21:38.240 --> 21:39.980
And I was like, oh, this guy was talking

21:39.980 --> 21:41.880
because the screen is broken.

21:41.880 --> 21:42.720
And I rolled it down.

21:42.720 --> 21:44.240
I was like, hey, could I also get some thing?

21:44.240 --> 21:46.760
And the voice from the screen was like, yeah, sure.

21:46.760 --> 21:49.680
And then I pulled around to the window.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.140
Why was that guy there?

21:52.640 --> 21:54.000
Was he a ghost maybe?

21:54.000 --> 21:55.240
I don't know.

21:55.240 --> 21:56.200
Did you imagine him

21:56.200 --> 21:58.260
and you were actually talking to the screen the whole time?

21:58.260 --> 22:01.300
Maybe it was Wendy's new hollow projector technology

22:01.300 --> 22:03.920
and the man was a hologram like Wolf Blitzer.

22:03.920 --> 22:06.680
Oh, maybe, you know, I didn't ask.

22:06.680 --> 22:08.080
I guess that was my fault really

22:08.080 --> 22:09.480
is I should have gotten up to the first window

22:09.480 --> 22:12.160
and be like, hey, why is that dude there?

22:12.160 --> 22:14.080
Well, you should have thrown like a fist full of coins

22:14.080 --> 22:16.040
at him if they traveled right through his body,

22:16.040 --> 22:17.920
then you're dealing with a...

22:17.920 --> 22:19.960
Well, that's assuming it's soft light technology.

22:19.960 --> 22:21.160
If it's hard light technology,

22:21.160 --> 22:23.000
then they're still gonna strike off of him.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.740
The only way you can know for sure

22:24.740 --> 22:27.120
is that if they look like a famous person,

22:27.120 --> 22:31.480
because you know that if Arby's has a hologram projection

22:31.480 --> 22:34.840
outside taking orders from people,

22:34.840 --> 22:35.680
why wouldn't you,

22:35.680 --> 22:37.760
you gotta make him look like James Dean

22:37.760 --> 22:39.400
or Elvis or something.

22:39.400 --> 22:42.360
Or Dean Stockwell, how good would that be?

22:42.360 --> 22:45.680
Oh my God, if he's putting your order into Ziggy.

22:45.680 --> 22:46.960
Fuck, that would roll.

22:49.840 --> 22:51.120
I don't know, I'm checking the numbers

22:51.120 --> 22:54.600
and it looks like, yeah, 100% probability of diarrhea.

22:57.440 --> 22:59.940
But I tried the new chicken go wrap.

22:59.940 --> 23:01.120
I should have left.

23:01.120 --> 23:03.040
You're gonna hope that your next leap

23:03.040 --> 23:04.680
will be the leap to your bathroom.

23:06.360 --> 23:07.880
Ziggy says you're gonna die

23:07.880 --> 23:10.320
if you eat this combo meal, definitely.

23:10.320 --> 23:11.880
Every day for the next 30 years.

23:11.880 --> 23:14.880
Definitely. Yes, you will, absolutely.

23:14.880 --> 23:17.520
I was just wondering what it takes to become a mayor.

23:17.520 --> 23:21.480
I have no political affiliations or any substantial income,

23:21.480 --> 23:24.160
but I think I would be a good one.

23:24.160 --> 23:25.760
What do you guys think is the best approach

23:25.760 --> 23:27.200
to take to become a mayor?

23:27.200 --> 23:29.440
Nay, a great mayor.

23:29.440 --> 23:32.420
That's from Mayorally Musing in Nebraska.

23:33.960 --> 23:37.960
I've seen a lot of stories lately about unlikely mayors.

23:37.960 --> 23:39.800
Yeah, like the little kid mayor or a dog mayor.

23:39.800 --> 23:41.700
The little kid mayor, the dog mayor.

23:41.700 --> 23:43.160
I think you gotta have an angle.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.520
Like why would you be mayor?

23:44.520 --> 23:47.160
Superhero mayor. Superhero mayor.

23:47.160 --> 23:49.720
Mayor by day, superhero by night.

23:49.720 --> 23:52.080
John Mayer, people love that.

23:52.080 --> 23:53.480
There's a town in New Hampshire,

23:53.480 --> 23:55.680
I think, where a boat is a mayor.

23:55.680 --> 23:57.800
They have a boat mayor. Seems convenient.

23:57.800 --> 23:59.520
It's not like a play on words or anything.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.740
Their mayor is a fucking boat.

24:01.740 --> 24:04.660
They have a boat that has municipal power over the city.

24:04.660 --> 24:06.200
What about a mer-mer?

24:06.200 --> 24:09.260
That's right, a horse that's a mayor.

24:09.260 --> 24:10.840
But here's the thing, you're not a horse.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.200
That's problem one.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.240
Ooh, what about a mirror mayor?

24:14.240 --> 24:15.880
And you have a mirror and it says over,

24:15.880 --> 24:18.480
like, look into the mirror to see the mayor of this town.

24:18.480 --> 24:20.040
It's you. It's you.

24:20.040 --> 24:23.160
It sounds like, it's like that Time Magazine cover.

24:23.160 --> 24:25.020
It sounds like to me that you guys

24:25.020 --> 24:29.280
just wanna think of fun wordplay.

24:29.280 --> 24:31.360
Moore mayor and Jay Moore is the mayor.

24:31.360 --> 24:33.120
What about a mayo mayor?

24:33.120 --> 24:33.960
Uh-huh.

24:33.960 --> 24:35.540
It's a jar of mayonnaise.

24:35.540 --> 24:36.380
Sure.

24:36.380 --> 24:37.840
I don't even know what a mayor does.

24:37.840 --> 24:39.980
Nobody knows what a mayor does

24:39.980 --> 24:41.740
because a mayor doesn't do any.

24:41.740 --> 24:43.440
Oh, I think the soda's too big,

24:43.440 --> 24:47.400
so let's go ahead and cut, no, shut up, no.

24:47.400 --> 24:50.920
Maybe we, I'm passing a law, no more soda.

24:50.920 --> 24:52.840
Like, you can't, you don't,

24:52.840 --> 24:55.440
you have no legislative powers over any of us.

24:55.440 --> 24:58.240
I think the mayor just appears at things, right?

24:58.240 --> 24:59.080
I think it's entirely different.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.640
Yeah, you make appearances.

25:00.640 --> 25:05.640
I think mayor has the fourth estate.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.560
What is the Tom Clancy shit?

25:07.560 --> 25:10.720
Like, he has, he is not judicial, legislative,

25:10.720 --> 25:14.860
or executive, he has powers elected to him,

25:14.860 --> 25:17.960
given to him by the secret parts of the Constitution

25:17.960 --> 25:20.600
that allow him to protect the other three branches

25:20.600 --> 25:23.160
of government using any means necessary.

25:23.160 --> 25:25.240
The fourth, so he's using the fourth freedom.

25:25.240 --> 25:26.600
The fourth freedom is, that's right.

25:26.600 --> 25:27.440
That's what you're talking about.

25:27.440 --> 25:28.760
That's what third echelon has.

25:28.760 --> 25:33.340
Freedom is, freedom of speech, freedom of dance,

25:33.340 --> 25:34.960
freedom of movement.

25:34.960 --> 25:36.280
Freedom to burger out.

25:36.280 --> 25:38.120
Freedom to burger out is the fifth freedom.

25:38.120 --> 25:40.120
The fourth freedom is, you can.

25:40.120 --> 25:40.960
Fourth meal.

25:40.960 --> 25:43.520
You can legally waterboard people if you're the mayor.

25:43.520 --> 25:45.480
I think the main thing mayor does

25:45.480 --> 25:47.760
is probably go places and get free shit.

25:47.760 --> 25:49.280
Like in a small town, I imagine,

25:49.280 --> 25:51.440
that's basically he's cruising up to the deli

25:51.440 --> 25:53.920
and asking him to throw a few extra slices on.

25:53.920 --> 25:56.900
He travels from deli to deli with his giant scissors

25:56.900 --> 25:59.400
that he also uses to cut the ribbon on things.

26:00.520 --> 26:02.000
He shakes hands with.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.440
That's the first, okay, that's,

26:03.440 --> 26:06.160
Travis, you've stumbled on step one unintentionally.

26:06.160 --> 26:08.140
That step one, if you wanna be a mayor,

26:08.140 --> 26:10.640
you have to invest in giant scissors.

26:10.640 --> 26:12.840
No one's gonna take you seriously.

26:12.840 --> 26:16.040
I would also suggest a golden shovel for groundbreakings.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.520
If you have those already,

26:17.520 --> 26:21.320
that was actually, in my failed campaign for mayor,

26:21.320 --> 26:24.120
that was my slogan, my campaign slogan was,

26:24.120 --> 26:25.800
hey, I already have the shovel.

26:25.800 --> 26:28.000
And it was a picture of me holding a shovel.

26:29.520 --> 26:31.640
Explain to me why you deserve our votes.

26:31.640 --> 26:34.840
You can just keep that shovel money right in your pocket.

26:34.840 --> 26:36.400
It also helps, oh, you gotta walk around

26:36.400 --> 26:39.600
with a push broom and say, I'm gonna clean up this town.

26:39.600 --> 26:42.200
Don't do what I did, which was have a poster

26:42.200 --> 26:43.440
with me in the broom and under it just says,

26:43.440 --> 26:44.800
sweep it up.

26:44.800 --> 26:46.040
Say, this is a real broom,

26:46.040 --> 26:48.120
but it was just you holding your palm out flat

26:48.120 --> 26:51.040
and somebody photoshopped a broom on top of it.

26:51.040 --> 26:52.520
But the broom was a clip art broom

26:52.520 --> 26:54.360
and it was way too small.

26:54.360 --> 26:56.840
Then he just switched it out and changed his tagline to,

26:56.840 --> 26:58.400
he knows how to use Photoshop.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.760
He knows what brooms look like.

27:01.760 --> 27:02.680
He knows how to find clip art.

27:02.680 --> 27:05.960
I'm gonna Photoshop all kinds of business into this town.

27:05.960 --> 27:09.840
I just don't, everyone's so upset about Rob Ford

27:09.840 --> 27:12.560
doing all, getting on all of these shenanigans.

27:12.560 --> 27:16.440
And it's like, he's the town clown.

27:18.880 --> 27:21.280
It's not like the president is doing crack.

27:21.280 --> 27:24.200
Nobody knows what this dude does.

27:24.200 --> 27:25.920
Nobody knows what his job is.

27:25.920 --> 27:28.200
Nobody knows where Toronto is.

27:28.200 --> 27:29.180
I think it's up.

27:30.180 --> 27:31.520
Yeah, it's definitely up.

27:31.520 --> 27:33.520
We can't help this person at all.

27:33.520 --> 27:34.660
How do you become a mayor?

27:34.660 --> 27:36.600
It's an elected position, that much I do know.

27:36.600 --> 27:38.280
I think it helps.

27:38.280 --> 27:40.160
You gotta get signatures first.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.000
Signatures?

27:41.000 --> 27:43.840
Yeah, I mean, you need a hundred signatures.

27:43.840 --> 27:46.520
I think in Nebraska,

27:46.520 --> 27:48.500
as long as you're outside of one of the major cities,

27:48.500 --> 27:50.400
I think you probably have a pretty good shot.

27:50.400 --> 27:51.560
Do you have a shovel?

27:51.560 --> 27:54.280
I think it helps if you were a mayor in school

27:55.300 --> 27:57.040
and then you can carry that over

27:57.040 --> 27:59.520
and then maybe get like be an apprentice mayor.

27:59.520 --> 28:00.840
Are you talking about like current mayor?

28:00.840 --> 28:01.760
In student council,

28:01.760 --> 28:04.720
are you talking about you majored in mayor?

28:04.720 --> 28:07.080
I mean, student council preferably,

28:07.080 --> 28:10.160
but you wanna have the practical experience,

28:10.160 --> 28:13.680
you could have a paper that says you're a mayor,

28:13.680 --> 28:17.480
but you wanna have some credits to your name.

28:17.480 --> 28:20.200
Something that says like, I mayored the lunchroom.

28:20.200 --> 28:23.260
I mayored at the library for a while.

28:24.440 --> 28:26.960
I don't think you know what the word means.

28:26.960 --> 28:27.800
I don't think any of us know.

28:27.800 --> 28:29.760
You have to mayor before you can mayor.

28:29.760 --> 28:30.600
You know what I mean?

28:30.600 --> 28:32.040
It's one of those things because they want someone

28:32.040 --> 28:34.120
with experience, but how do you get the job

28:34.120 --> 28:35.480
to get the experience?

28:35.480 --> 28:37.960
Can you shadow the current mayor?

28:37.960 --> 28:39.560
Could you stalk the current mayor?

28:39.560 --> 28:41.100
Oh, fun.

28:41.100 --> 28:42.440
You could become the mayor.

28:42.440 --> 28:43.360
Ooh, okay.

28:43.360 --> 28:45.400
Plastic surgery, become the mayor,

28:45.400 --> 28:48.880
just silently take over like in Dave.

28:48.880 --> 28:50.460
You gotta Dave the mayor.

28:51.560 --> 28:53.400
It's been a long time since I saw Dave,

28:53.400 --> 28:55.000
but I think that's what happens.

28:56.040 --> 28:59.500
There was an 11 year old mayor in Texas.

28:59.500 --> 29:00.920
Yeah, that's how we do.

29:02.240 --> 29:05.240
Our fucking shit is so free.

29:05.240 --> 29:09.640
We will do shit to just make sure everyone knows

29:09.640 --> 29:11.480
how free we are down here.

29:11.480 --> 29:12.520
We got an armadillo mayor.

29:12.520 --> 29:14.320
Fuck you, fuck your rules.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.200
We don't need them.

29:15.200 --> 29:17.400
We're basically a big state full of pirates.

29:18.640 --> 29:23.640
He actually, he was in an unincorporated community

29:23.640 --> 29:28.640
and his one platform was that he was gonna get them

29:29.600 --> 29:33.080
incorporated and the problem was that making them

29:33.080 --> 29:36.420
an incorporated community, there are laws that said

29:36.420 --> 29:37.960
he would have to be 18 years old,

29:37.960 --> 29:39.720
so he would put himself out of a job.

29:39.720 --> 29:42.800
It was sacrificing his own mayorship.

29:42.800 --> 29:45.360
Isn't that a beautiful, beautiful story?

29:45.360 --> 29:47.000
And that got him the job.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.880
That got him the job because he was gonna sacrifice himself.

29:50.880 --> 29:52.680
You think they were just waiting until he turns 18

29:52.680 --> 29:54.880
and then they get him back up in office?

29:55.920 --> 29:58.700
I don't know, this is a long time ago.

30:00.000 --> 30:00.840
There was a movie.

30:00.840 --> 30:02.960
And his name was Barack Obama.

30:02.960 --> 30:05.800
Barack Hussein Obama.

30:05.800 --> 30:06.760
Look at him now.

30:06.760 --> 30:07.600
Look at him now.

30:07.600 --> 30:09.480
And now you know the rest of the story.

30:09.480 --> 30:12.300
That is why Barack Obama has carried Texas

30:12.300 --> 30:14.720
with such a wide margin of votes

30:14.720 --> 30:16.860
in both presidential elections.

30:17.780 --> 30:18.940
And that's why when he retired,

30:18.940 --> 30:23.160
when he is kicked out of office in 2016 or earlier,

30:23.160 --> 30:28.160
God willing, Benghazi, then he's gonna come back to Texas

30:29.200 --> 30:30.520
and he's gonna be the governor here

30:30.520 --> 30:31.560
because we just can't get enough

30:31.560 --> 30:32.840
of that guy's fucking flavor.

30:32.840 --> 30:36.360
We just cannot get enough of his freedoms.

30:36.360 --> 30:37.600
Can you step back?

30:37.600 --> 30:39.720
We love his Obamacare.

30:39.720 --> 30:40.960
They always make jokes on West Wing

30:40.960 --> 30:41.800
that when you're president,

30:41.800 --> 30:43.260
it's like the last job you'll ever have.

30:43.260 --> 30:46.600
Can you be president and then go be governor of somewhere

30:46.600 --> 30:48.400
and then be mayor of somewhere

30:48.400 --> 30:49.840
and then be on city council?

30:49.840 --> 30:51.340
And then work your way back up?

30:52.480 --> 30:55.760
And then you die as the treasurer

30:55.760 --> 30:57.200
of some student council somewhere?

30:57.200 --> 30:58.040
Is that what you're saying?

30:58.040 --> 31:01.360
I'm just saying, what's the life cycle after presidency?

31:01.360 --> 31:02.440
I think you just lamp.

31:02.440 --> 31:05.440
And I think you just talk at schools about abstinence.

31:05.440 --> 31:08.240
You can finally tell everybody what you think of them.

31:08.240 --> 31:09.560
Oh.

31:09.560 --> 31:12.000
God, how loose cannon would I?

31:12.000 --> 31:14.560
I don't understand why presidents, former presidents,

31:14.560 --> 31:16.560
aren't going full loose cannon.

31:16.560 --> 31:19.240
The only thing that keeps me from going full loose cannon

31:19.240 --> 31:23.080
right now in my day to day is the possibility

31:23.080 --> 31:25.560
that here in about seven years,

31:25.560 --> 31:27.240
I'm gonna be the president.

31:27.240 --> 31:30.100
And I cannot have my campaign sullied

31:30.100 --> 31:32.440
by the actions of my youth.

31:32.440 --> 31:35.240
But if I had already been president at this point.

31:35.240 --> 31:37.200
What are they gonna stop you from doing?

31:37.200 --> 31:38.980
You can't take that away from me.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.480
Try to take me off the nickel.

31:40.480 --> 31:41.320
You can't.

31:41.320 --> 31:42.640
Try to put me on the dime.

31:42.640 --> 31:44.000
There's somebody else there.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.120
I'll stand in the background.

31:45.120 --> 31:46.560
I'm not even worried about it.

31:46.560 --> 31:47.400
Loose cannon.

31:48.560 --> 31:50.480
Hey, you gonna spin me?

31:50.480 --> 31:51.540
Don't look at him, look at me.

31:51.540 --> 31:53.040
Don't look at him, look at me.

31:54.760 --> 31:55.780
Look over here.

31:55.780 --> 31:56.920
I'm in the corner.

31:56.920 --> 31:59.120
If you want to check out the spider on the one,

31:59.120 --> 32:00.220
check it out.

32:00.220 --> 32:01.060
There's a pyramid there.

32:01.060 --> 32:01.880
I built that.

32:01.880 --> 32:02.720
Really close in.

32:02.720 --> 32:03.560
Look at it.

32:03.560 --> 32:04.720
The spider's got Justin's face on it.

32:04.720 --> 32:05.840
You don't give a fuck.

32:05.840 --> 32:06.800
Look at the top of the pyramid.

32:06.800 --> 32:07.640
There's an eye there.

32:07.640 --> 32:08.920
It's my eye.

32:08.920 --> 32:10.080
It's always been.

32:10.080 --> 32:10.920
Let's get a money zone.

32:10.920 --> 32:11.760
Let's give you money.

32:11.760 --> 32:16.760
I got a message.

32:22.640 --> 32:24.400
Got a message for Eric,

32:24.400 --> 32:26.160
but that's not the important thing.

32:26.160 --> 32:28.080
The more important thing is that this message

32:28.080 --> 32:31.500
is as near as I can tell from the sheet from Nas.

32:32.560 --> 32:34.680
So Nas in this case is spelled N-A-Z,

32:34.680 --> 32:37.680
which is not the traditionally accepted spelling of Nas,

32:37.680 --> 32:39.680
the rapper, which is N-A-S.

32:39.680 --> 32:40.500
Correct.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.400
Well, you didn't have to tell him that.

32:43.320 --> 32:44.160
I just thought it was important

32:44.160 --> 32:45.160
that people know that it's.

32:45.160 --> 32:47.320
To be friend, he's Nas to the public,

32:47.320 --> 32:48.840
but he's Nas to his friends.

32:48.840 --> 32:49.680
He's not.

32:49.680 --> 32:51.480
Okay, so Nas the rapper writes,

32:51.480 --> 32:53.280
Eric is my very best bud.

32:53.280 --> 32:55.160
He introduced me to my bim bam

32:55.160 --> 32:57.740
and listening to the show together

32:57.740 --> 32:59.400
is one of our favorite things to do.

32:59.400 --> 33:00.480
Happy birthday, friend.

33:00.480 --> 33:02.080
You're the best and I love you.

33:02.080 --> 33:03.760
And I'm definitely the rapper.

33:03.760 --> 33:05.400
I'm definitely the rapper, Nas.

33:05.400 --> 33:09.120
You know, this is an angle on Jumbotron announcements

33:09.120 --> 33:09.960
that we never thought of.

33:09.960 --> 33:12.840
You could assign a celebrity to wish you

33:12.840 --> 33:14.840
a very special greeting.

33:14.840 --> 33:15.680
Think about it.

33:15.680 --> 33:18.480
This message is for Eric and it's from Tom Hanks.

33:18.480 --> 33:20.560
And he says, I never would have gotten into acting

33:20.560 --> 33:22.040
if it weren't for you.

33:22.040 --> 33:23.480
You're the best.

33:23.480 --> 33:25.400
I based my character and big on you.

33:27.080 --> 33:29.160
Because of what happened to you when you were a child.

33:29.160 --> 33:32.080
When you were cursed by a fortune teller machine

33:32.080 --> 33:33.180
and then you fucked some lady

33:33.180 --> 33:34.720
that was like 20 years older than you

33:34.720 --> 33:38.760
and she is technically wanted for statutory.

33:38.760 --> 33:40.160
Life sure is hard.

33:40.160 --> 33:43.040
Love you lots, best bud, Tom Hanks.

33:43.040 --> 33:43.960
Tommy Hanks.

33:43.960 --> 33:46.240
Tommy Salami to his friends.

33:46.240 --> 33:49.360
Please don't tell everyone that my true name

33:49.360 --> 33:50.800
is Tommy Salami and that I changed it

33:50.800 --> 33:52.100
when I moved to Hollywood.

33:53.400 --> 33:55.760
Hollywood sure did change Tommy Salami.

33:56.800 --> 33:58.000
That guy used to be cool.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.480
They accidentally put out a draft

33:59.480 --> 34:02.160
of that new Walt Disney, Mary Poppins movie.

34:02.160 --> 34:04.000
They, the first trailer they sent out

34:04.000 --> 34:05.580
credited him as Tommy Salami

34:05.580 --> 34:09.540
and they had to recall the old celluloid on that bad boy.

34:09.540 --> 34:10.380
Yeah.

34:11.320 --> 34:12.800
Got another message from Michelle.

34:12.800 --> 34:13.920
Who's it from Griffin?

34:13.920 --> 34:16.960
It's from Maureen, Aaron, Mark, Rhea,

34:16.960 --> 34:18.880
Murder and Sweet Baby, her two kids.

34:18.880 --> 34:20.880
Basically the entire cast of Rent.

34:20.880 --> 34:22.040
Okay.

34:22.040 --> 34:23.280
Happy birthday, Michelle.

34:23.280 --> 34:24.160
Okay.

34:24.160 --> 34:26.320
You go ahead, go for it.

34:26.320 --> 34:28.000
Okay, but don't like ask me to read something

34:28.000 --> 34:30.760
and then like chomp it.

34:30.760 --> 34:32.560
A lot of bit chomping this episode.

34:32.560 --> 34:33.900
A lot of chomping this episode.

34:33.900 --> 34:36.760
Happy 30th birthday, fucking goddammit.

34:36.760 --> 34:38.640
Happy 30th birthday, Michelle.

34:38.640 --> 34:40.280
We know how much you love my bim bam

34:40.280 --> 34:43.120
so we joined forces to wish you the best birthday ever.

34:43.120 --> 34:45.040
May it be filled with friends, wine, fleetwood, mac,

34:45.040 --> 34:47.160
dancing, more friends, and kale.

34:47.160 --> 34:48.540
You're the tortilla that covers

34:48.540 --> 34:50.540
our Santa Barbara love burrito.

34:50.540 --> 34:53.260
Let's stay weird and friends forever.

34:53.260 --> 34:54.840
Beautiful.

34:54.840 --> 34:56.080
You really had me tilt kale.

34:56.080 --> 34:57.640
You had me tilt love burrito.

34:57.640 --> 34:59.480
Yuck, yuck, yuck-a-duck.

34:59.480 --> 35:01.520
I gotta wash that memory away

35:01.520 --> 35:03.800
and the only way I can do it is with stack soap.

35:03.800 --> 35:07.040
Stack soap is a beautiful, unconventional product

35:07.040 --> 35:08.740
that is a soap with a divot.

35:08.740 --> 35:10.200
So when you get down to the stupid sliver,

35:10.200 --> 35:11.740
you jam the sliver into the divot

35:11.740 --> 35:13.800
and oh my god, eternal soap.

35:13.800 --> 35:16.440
Do not prematurely slam the divot.

35:16.440 --> 35:17.280
Don't slam the divot before the time.

35:17.280 --> 35:19.440
Because we tried to do that with our stack soap

35:19.440 --> 35:21.780
and Teresa was like, well our soap doesn't fit

35:21.780 --> 35:23.960
but we had not been patient and we had not waited.

35:23.960 --> 35:26.360
Sometimes you get too excited about that momentous time.

35:26.360 --> 35:28.280
We tried to slam the divot.

35:28.280 --> 35:31.520
I've been rocking the same bar for like a year now.

35:31.520 --> 35:33.280
Just keep, I just keep slamming that divot

35:33.280 --> 35:37.520
and like I get so excited to just slam it.

35:37.520 --> 35:38.640
I take it with me everywhere I go.

35:38.640 --> 35:40.660
Camping, spaceship.

35:41.760 --> 35:42.600
Time.

35:42.600 --> 35:43.440
Camping, spaceship.

35:43.440 --> 35:44.440
Time travel.

35:44.440 --> 35:45.940
Can you even imagine if I took this shit

35:45.940 --> 35:47.300
back to colonial days and was like,

35:47.300 --> 35:49.800
check out this stack soap, colonial fucks.

35:49.800 --> 35:51.800
And they were like, oh goodness.

35:51.800 --> 35:53.080
Because that's how they talked.

35:53.080 --> 35:54.640
And then you check your book and it's like,

35:54.640 --> 35:56.840
oh and now I'm gonna blot out the sun with my power

35:56.840 --> 35:59.480
but you didn't because it was just an eclipse.

35:59.480 --> 36:01.480
But you read it wrong so there's not an eclipse.

36:01.480 --> 36:03.240
So they just think you're a liar.

36:03.240 --> 36:05.480
And then they burn you to death and keep your soap.

36:05.480 --> 36:07.480
Burn you to death and keep your peppermint,

36:07.480 --> 36:09.200
jasmine, and unscented soap.

36:09.200 --> 36:11.560
There's three different varieties now.

36:11.560 --> 36:13.960
You can get them on Amazon but go to, do me a favor.

36:13.960 --> 36:16.120
If you're in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Washington, DC,

36:16.120 --> 36:17.960
South New Jersey, Virginia, or Kentucky,

36:17.960 --> 36:20.240
go to Whole Foods, buy them there

36:20.240 --> 36:22.800
so more Whole Foods will carry them.

36:22.800 --> 36:23.720
And just buy that.

36:23.720 --> 36:24.560
Don't buy anything else.

36:24.560 --> 36:25.880
Don't buy anything else

36:25.880 --> 36:27.880
because they know they track everything.

36:29.080 --> 36:31.520
Buy it at Whole Foods, get it as a gift,

36:31.520 --> 36:34.160
and go to stacksoap.com to get more information about it.

36:34.160 --> 36:37.720
Speaking of foods, man,

36:39.360 --> 36:41.920
I got a deep hunger in my belly.

36:41.920 --> 36:46.560
I finished all the Thanksgiving leftovers.

36:46.560 --> 36:49.520
I ate it for like six meals in a row.

36:49.520 --> 36:52.260
I'm like half turkey fat now.

36:52.260 --> 36:55.000
I wish I had something I could put in my bell bell.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.040
Well, I got great news for you, Griffin.

36:58.040 --> 36:59.420
Nature box. Okay.

36:59.420 --> 37:01.060
Nature box.

37:01.060 --> 37:02.620
Have you heard about it?

37:02.620 --> 37:06.340
I've heard of nature and I know like what boxes are.

37:06.340 --> 37:08.140
So I'm imagining just like you put some bushes

37:08.140 --> 37:09.340
and dirt in a box.

37:09.340 --> 37:10.780
Yep.

37:10.780 --> 37:13.020
No, you're so wrong.

37:13.020 --> 37:13.860
Shit.

37:13.860 --> 37:15.300
Do you like bush boxes?

37:16.180 --> 37:20.480
Is that like an old porn vagina?

37:20.480 --> 37:22.180
What are you talking about?

37:22.180 --> 37:26.540
The nature box is a collection of healthy snacks

37:26.540 --> 37:31.100
sent to you every month and they're not bad,

37:31.100 --> 37:33.220
they're delicious, but they are healthy.

37:33.220 --> 37:35.680
We can get like dark cocoa almonds, those are very good.

37:35.680 --> 37:37.740
Salted caramel pretzel pops, delicious.

37:37.740 --> 37:38.580
French toast granola.

37:38.580 --> 37:39.980
Listen, I put it to you this way.

37:39.980 --> 37:41.480
You know when you can go to a vending machine

37:41.480 --> 37:43.100
and you want to eat the healthy option,

37:43.100 --> 37:45.640
so you're like, oh, that nut granola bar thing

37:45.640 --> 37:48.700
that's coated in sugar and it's all like this process

37:48.700 --> 37:51.340
to gross food, but you're trying to trick yourself

37:51.340 --> 37:52.780
into thinking that's the healthy option?

37:52.780 --> 37:53.660
Those are Skittles.

37:53.660 --> 37:55.440
You accidentally bought Skittles.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.360
This is the real option.

37:57.360 --> 37:58.800
This is the thing that's gonna get to you

37:58.800 --> 38:02.260
and you're gonna be amazed by both how delicious it is

38:02.260 --> 38:04.100
and it's good for you.

38:04.100 --> 38:06.780
Like what more do you want than that?

38:06.780 --> 38:08.860
I can't imagine.

38:08.860 --> 38:11.040
And you're gonna be able to,

38:11.040 --> 38:12.820
we're gonna get you a little discount here.

38:12.820 --> 38:13.800
It's no big deal.

38:13.800 --> 38:14.960
Don't tell anybody.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.440
Tell everybody.

38:16.440 --> 38:18.300
But make sure they use this coupon code.

38:18.300 --> 38:19.120
That's the thing.

38:20.780 --> 38:23.620

38:37.300 --> 38:38.120
It's all there.

38:38.120 --> 38:39.460
You want umami?

38:39.460 --> 38:40.940
Ooh, umami, do you?

38:42.740 --> 38:44.460
I don't think that's a thing, but.

38:44.460 --> 38:46.500
Umami, it's yeah, it's the hidden flavor.

38:46.500 --> 38:47.340
It's the fourth.

38:47.340 --> 38:49.120
No, I don't think umami do you.

38:49.120 --> 38:51.260
It's the fourth estate of flavors.

38:51.260 --> 38:53.380
It's the flavor that protects the other flavors

38:53.380 --> 38:55.300
and it can do whatever it needs to to do it,

38:55.300 --> 38:56.980
including waterboarding.

38:56.980 --> 38:58.100
Alton Brown invented it.

38:58.100 --> 38:59.620
Alton Brown invented it.

38:59.620 --> 39:02.200
Cause um, it's just the best.

39:03.180 --> 39:07.780
So naturebox.com, go get it, eat it, live.

39:07.780 --> 39:10.140
Pretty good tagline for them if they need one.

39:11.240 --> 39:14.500
Get it, eat it, live.

39:14.500 --> 39:17.060
Alive.

39:17.060 --> 39:18.020
Hey, I'm Jesse Thorn.

39:18.020 --> 39:19.180
Hey, I'm Jordan Morris.

39:19.180 --> 39:20.100
We're actual friends.

39:20.100 --> 39:22.420
And actual professional broadcasters.

39:22.420 --> 39:23.540
We host Jordan, Jesse Go!

39:23.540 --> 39:25.820
A show about, you know, friendship, being a person.

39:25.820 --> 39:29.020
Yeah, we run the full spectrum from feelings

39:29.020 --> 39:32.340
to some of the most vulgar jokes you can imagine.

39:32.340 --> 39:34.180
And honestly, putting it that way

39:34.180 --> 39:36.760
makes it seem like it's half and a half,

39:36.760 --> 39:38.660
at best 25, 75.

39:38.660 --> 39:41.500
It's definitely mostly vulgarity,

39:41.500 --> 39:44.340
but it's a pleasant, friendly vulgarity

39:44.340 --> 39:47.740
from two guys who went to a reasonably

39:47.740 --> 39:49.980
prestigious UC college.

39:49.980 --> 39:51.360
Why don't you try the show out now?

39:51.360 --> 39:53.060
Grab one with one of your favorite comedians,

39:53.060 --> 39:55.300
like a Rob Corddry or Rob Delaney or whatever.

39:55.300 --> 39:57.660
Or somebody awesome that maybe you haven't heard of yet.

39:57.660 --> 40:01.340
Yeah, go to Maximumfun.org or your favorite podcasting app

40:01.340 --> 40:04.180
and download an episode of Jordan, Jesse Go! now.

40:08.620 --> 40:11.380
Justin, oh my God, introduce Farm Wisdom.

40:11.380 --> 40:16.380
Farm wisdom, farm wisdom.

40:18.220 --> 40:20.860
Grow some corn and watch some porn.

40:20.860 --> 40:21.700
No, why would you?

40:21.700 --> 40:23.460
Nailed it, nailed it.

40:23.460 --> 40:24.300
That's gross.

40:24.300 --> 40:26.940
You really touched on the too hot topic

40:26.940 --> 40:29.780
that farmers are worried about today.

40:29.780 --> 40:31.020
What should they grow,

40:31.020 --> 40:33.420
and then what should they do with their free time?

40:33.420 --> 40:34.360
We got it covered.

40:34.360 --> 40:36.380
Do you guys think there's farmer porn?

40:36.380 --> 40:38.500
Do you think that there's a set of specific things

40:38.500 --> 40:40.740
that only, like a good mulch,

40:40.740 --> 40:43.620
that farmers just can't get it going

40:43.620 --> 40:46.720
unless they experience that in their porn?

40:46.720 --> 40:47.560
Definitely.

40:47.560 --> 40:51.420
You think that farmer porn has to have mulch?

40:51.420 --> 40:52.780
I'm saying that there, that's a-

40:52.780 --> 40:54.700
I think regular porn has to have mulch,

40:54.700 --> 40:55.560
but that's just me.

40:55.560 --> 40:58.400
I'm a man of very exotic tastes.

40:58.400 --> 41:00.440
I think that farmer porn has to incorporate

41:00.440 --> 41:03.140
some sort of element about topsoil erosion,

41:04.660 --> 41:07.940
about the water table.

41:07.940 --> 41:10.340
I think that like, they have to set that up.

41:10.340 --> 41:12.380
Like, you know how some porn has like a fiction to it,

41:12.380 --> 41:13.220
they have to set that up.

41:13.220 --> 41:16.180
Like, hey, I lost my phone when I was over here

41:16.180 --> 41:17.020
for the party.

41:17.020 --> 41:18.180
Come in, cool.

41:18.180 --> 41:20.220
Yeah, hey, can you tell me about the water table

41:20.220 --> 41:21.620
here at your place?

41:21.620 --> 41:23.720
And she's like, oh yeah, it's,

41:23.720 --> 41:26.020
we're looking at a pH balance of about four,

41:26.020 --> 41:27.460
which makes it good for, you know,

41:27.460 --> 41:30.860
more acidic things like peaches.

41:30.860 --> 41:33.660
Wouldn't mind, I'd like to see your peaches.

41:33.660 --> 41:34.940
Yeah, they're great.

41:34.940 --> 41:36.420
We have this new mulch,

41:36.420 --> 41:38.580
and they're growing really nice and plump.

41:38.580 --> 41:40.260
All right, well, thanks, bye.

41:40.260 --> 41:41.100
And then he leaves.

41:41.100 --> 41:41.940
And then he leaves.

41:41.940 --> 41:42.760
And then he leaves.

41:42.760 --> 41:43.600
And then he leaves.

41:43.600 --> 41:44.440
And then he leaves.

41:44.440 --> 41:45.260
And then he leaves.

41:45.260 --> 41:46.100
And then he leaves.

41:46.100 --> 41:46.940
And then he leaves.

41:46.940 --> 41:47.920
And then he's ready.

41:47.920 --> 41:49.820
I bought a book to learn how to raise goats

41:49.820 --> 41:51.980
to make artisan goat cheeses,

41:51.980 --> 41:55.040
and was shocked to find that when baby goats' kids

41:55.040 --> 41:57.820
are delivered breach, they sometimes look dead.

41:57.820 --> 41:58.660
They aren't.

41:58.660 --> 42:01.740
In order to, quote, wake the goats up, end quote,

42:01.740 --> 42:04.280
the farmers must grab the kid by its neck and feet

42:04.280 --> 42:06.740
and swing a big U shape several times

42:06.740 --> 42:09.860
to clear the amniotic fluid out of its nose and lungs.

42:09.860 --> 42:11.020
Gross, right?

42:11.020 --> 42:12.300
That's from Tiffany.

42:12.300 --> 42:13.180
I mean, that's how humans.

42:13.180 --> 42:16.080
They have to do that to human babies, too, I think, right?

42:16.080 --> 42:17.400
How else are they gonna start breathing?

42:17.400 --> 42:19.280
Don't you think that that's like 50-50,

42:19.280 --> 42:20.840
like that's what you have to do,

42:20.840 --> 42:22.840
and also it's probably pretty fun for the farmer?

42:22.840 --> 42:24.720
Probably pretty fun to do it, yeah.

42:24.720 --> 42:26.280
The farmer's like, ooh, breach!

42:26.280 --> 42:28.200
Whip, boop, boom, go dance!

42:28.200 --> 42:31.000
Pretend to do like a quick little Fred Astaire cane wobble.

42:32.000 --> 42:36.760
My father, who is a soybean and corn farmer in Illinois,

42:36.760 --> 42:37.780
told me and my sister,

42:37.780 --> 42:39.440
if you see a dead snake in the road,

42:39.440 --> 42:41.760
in three days you'll have rain.

42:41.760 --> 42:45.080
And if it rains in January, you'll have frost in May.

42:45.080 --> 42:47.000
That's science, it's from Cindy.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.600
It's not science though, Cindy.

42:48.600 --> 42:49.440
Cindy, I hate to break.

42:49.440 --> 42:52.080
The thing is, I feel like you could do correlation science

42:52.080 --> 42:55.580
with like the rain in January, frost in May,

42:55.580 --> 42:57.480
but what connection could a dead snake

42:57.480 --> 42:59.280
possibly have to rain?

42:59.280 --> 43:01.440
If I start killing snakes, can I summon the right,

43:01.440 --> 43:05.260
like what are the rules to this science?

43:05.260 --> 43:07.160
I bet your dad is trying to fib you out on that.

43:07.160 --> 43:08.760
I bet it starts raining two days after,

43:08.760 --> 43:11.760
and he's like, well, if you think about it,

43:11.760 --> 43:14.220
I guess if you count from hours,

43:14.220 --> 43:15.720
it's really three days.

43:15.720 --> 43:17.640
If you count the first day as a day,

43:17.640 --> 43:19.680
you can pretty much justify anytime you see a dead snake,

43:19.680 --> 43:20.680
it's probably three days.

43:20.680 --> 43:22.720
And are we talking about like the first person

43:22.720 --> 43:23.560
that sees a snake?

43:23.560 --> 43:25.200
Like if you see the snake and it starts raining one day,

43:25.200 --> 43:27.280
can you just assume that someone saw that dead snake

43:27.280 --> 43:28.960
two days before you did?

43:28.960 --> 43:30.620
Oh, good question, because if you see it

43:30.620 --> 43:32.540
and then your friend sees it the next day,

43:32.540 --> 43:34.080
who's right and who's wrong?

43:34.080 --> 43:35.920
People will just keep seeing this fucking snake

43:35.920 --> 43:36.960
over and over and over again.

43:36.960 --> 43:38.320
You could have like a perpetual drought.

43:38.320 --> 43:39.140
That's why I should say,

43:39.140 --> 43:41.600
if you see a dead snake in the road and then eat it,

43:41.600 --> 43:43.120
it will rain in three days.

43:43.120 --> 43:45.160
If a snake sees it's raining,

43:45.160 --> 43:47.400
does it call its parents right away?

43:47.400 --> 43:49.720
I'm fine, I'm fine.

43:49.720 --> 43:51.140
Has anyone heard from Jimmy?

43:51.140 --> 43:52.120
It's been like three days.

43:52.120 --> 43:54.200
Oh, fuck, Jimmy, no.

43:54.200 --> 43:55.040
No.

43:56.760 --> 43:59.640
I can't believe we don't have any subway hacks.

43:59.640 --> 44:00.480
I know.

44:00.480 --> 44:02.240
We did get one where someone was worried

44:02.240 --> 44:03.080
that the other way around,

44:03.080 --> 44:05.680
that if you subway hacked the subway artist,

44:05.680 --> 44:07.900
they would not give you enough condiments.

44:07.900 --> 44:11.520
I felt it was a very scary world

44:11.520 --> 44:13.120
in which the subway artist would be able

44:13.120 --> 44:15.000
to revenge himself upon us.

44:15.000 --> 44:15.920
Oh, vindictive.

44:15.920 --> 44:18.360
He knows he got snowed,

44:18.360 --> 44:21.280
so he's gonna try to take away your mustard?

44:21.280 --> 44:23.120
We got a subway hack from somebody claiming

44:23.120 --> 44:25.680
you can get a subway sandwich with every topping,

44:25.680 --> 44:28.360
including all toppings, for around $18.

44:29.680 --> 44:32.360
For some reason, it really upset the artist

44:32.360 --> 44:34.160
to get it on flatbread.

44:34.160 --> 44:35.760
Oh, man, that sucks.

44:35.760 --> 44:40.300
Let me get a turkey, ham, Swiss, pizza sauce,

44:40.300 --> 44:43.120
avocado, chicken, bacon, ranch.

44:43.120 --> 44:44.360
Of course I want it toasted,

44:44.360 --> 44:46.980
and I want it toasted after everything's been put on it.

44:46.980 --> 44:47.820
You can do that,

44:47.820 --> 44:50.800
but you'd legally have to eat it in front of them.

44:50.800 --> 44:52.880
God, now I'm really hungry.

44:52.880 --> 44:55.680
Like the fucking kid in the chocolate cake from Matilda.

44:57.740 --> 44:59.840
People in the subway start cheering you on.

45:00.880 --> 45:03.340
Should you thank a waiter every time they pour you water?

45:03.340 --> 45:04.520
Yes.

45:04.520 --> 45:06.400
Thanking them every time feels weird,

45:06.400 --> 45:08.000
but so does ignoring them.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.360
Thank them every time.

45:09.360 --> 45:10.540
You thank them every time.

45:10.540 --> 45:11.680
That's an easy one.

45:11.680 --> 45:13.000
Let me throw this out.

45:13.000 --> 45:13.840
Okay.

45:13.840 --> 45:16.200
You do a thanking of diminishing returns.

45:16.200 --> 45:17.040
Thanks!

45:17.040 --> 45:18.580
The first time, you're like, oh, thank you.

45:18.580 --> 45:20.040
The second time, you're like, oh, thank you.

45:20.040 --> 45:20.880
Thanks.

45:20.880 --> 45:21.920
The third time, you're like, well, thanks.

45:21.920 --> 45:23.360
And then by the end, you're just like,

45:23.360 --> 45:24.200
fuck you.

45:24.200 --> 45:25.600
Thank you, thank you.

45:25.600 --> 45:26.840
Thank you.

45:26.840 --> 45:27.680
It has to go back to the-

45:27.680 --> 45:28.520
You just look at them and nod.

45:28.520 --> 45:29.920
Goes back to the other side.

45:30.880 --> 45:31.880
God damn it.

45:31.880 --> 45:33.560
Enough, enough.

45:33.560 --> 45:34.800
That's plenty.

45:34.800 --> 45:37.160
I'm peeing like a madman over here.

45:37.160 --> 45:38.360
You guys wanna get a who?

45:38.360 --> 45:39.840
Please.

45:39.840 --> 45:41.520
It's Yahoo was sent in by Ashley Eubank.

45:41.520 --> 45:42.360
Thanks, Ashley.

45:42.360 --> 45:44.540
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jordan, who asks,

45:45.560 --> 45:48.680
why do I look bad in pictures, but good in a mirror?

45:49.840 --> 45:52.280
I look horrible in picture, but good in a mirror.

45:52.280 --> 45:53.600
I heard if you look into a mirror

45:53.600 --> 45:54.900
and then you hold up a small mirror

45:54.900 --> 45:56.660
and look at yourself by projecting the mirror image

45:56.660 --> 45:57.980
onto the small mirror,

45:57.980 --> 45:59.880
that is what you look like to other people, is this true?

45:59.880 --> 46:01.120
What?

46:01.120 --> 46:01.940
Wait, hold on.

46:01.940 --> 46:02.780
It took a weird turn,

46:02.780 --> 46:04.320
because I was about to be like, okay, yeah, I get it.

46:04.320 --> 46:05.440
What?

46:05.440 --> 46:06.280
What?

46:06.280 --> 46:07.120
They have a point,

46:07.120 --> 46:08.920
when you look in your mirror image, right?

46:08.920 --> 46:10.040
They talked about this on Radio Lab.

46:10.040 --> 46:10.880
If you look at the mirror image,

46:10.880 --> 46:11.880
that's not what other people see.

46:11.880 --> 46:15.260
They see the opposite of that.

46:15.260 --> 46:19.000
You are seeing all of your features reflected, but backwards.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.520
How do you look into the mirror

46:20.520 --> 46:23.200
and the other mirror at the same time

46:23.200 --> 46:24.720
with your reflection in it?

46:24.720 --> 46:28.280
You hold up a mirror and your face to the mirror

46:28.280 --> 46:29.720
and you look at your face in the second mirror

46:29.720 --> 46:31.320
that you're holding up to the first mirror.

46:31.320 --> 46:32.640
That's easy peasy.

46:32.640 --> 46:34.400
Wait, so you're looking in mirror A

46:34.400 --> 46:36.480
and seeing the reflection from mirror B

46:36.480 --> 46:38.000
of the reflection in mirror A?

46:38.000 --> 46:39.120
Yeah, this isn't that hard.

46:39.120 --> 46:39.960
I do not understand

46:39.960 --> 46:41.240
why you're having so much trouble with this.

46:41.240 --> 46:44.140
And if a sunbeam hits mirror A,

46:44.140 --> 46:45.960
you will burn your face off.

46:45.960 --> 46:46.800
Okay.

46:46.800 --> 46:48.380
You will lose your eyesight.

46:48.380 --> 46:49.600
But in that circumstance,

46:49.600 --> 46:52.160
if you're looking at A to see B and A,

46:52.160 --> 46:53.100
aren't you not seeing,

46:53.100 --> 46:54.920
you're seeing a double, triple,

46:54.920 --> 46:56.520
wait, the triple reflection.

46:57.560 --> 46:58.800
I'm so confused.

46:58.800 --> 47:00.280
What you have to do is rip your own eyeballs

47:00.280 --> 47:01.120
out of your head.

47:01.120 --> 47:01.960
Okay.

47:01.960 --> 47:02.780
Now, again, you're not-

47:02.780 --> 47:03.620
You didn't say that.

47:03.620 --> 47:04.460
I didn't have all of the details.

47:04.460 --> 47:06.240
You are not gonna get the full picture of it,

47:06.240 --> 47:08.120
because again, you will be missing eyeballs.

47:08.120 --> 47:10.520
And that is a pretty important part of the face.

47:11.600 --> 47:12.800
I think with the mirror,

47:12.800 --> 47:15.360
I think if I were to guess at an actual answer here,

47:15.360 --> 47:18.000
I think the difference between mirror and photographs

47:18.000 --> 47:20.960
is that even if it just takes a moment,

47:20.960 --> 47:22.060
when you're in a mirror,

47:22.060 --> 47:26.720
you can adjust your angles and your facial expression.

47:26.720 --> 47:28.240
So you can kind of see,

47:28.240 --> 47:31.400
you can adjust and tweak the look.

47:31.400 --> 47:32.980
But I think in a camera,

47:32.980 --> 47:34.560
you're just kind of throwing caution to the wind

47:34.560 --> 47:37.880
and hoping that it's a great angle.

47:37.880 --> 47:39.160
I actually, I think it has more

47:39.160 --> 47:40.760
of a psychological factor to it,

47:40.760 --> 47:42.600
where I think you can look in the mirror

47:42.600 --> 47:46.160
and know that that is ever changing.

47:46.160 --> 47:48.160
And maybe you've got a bad hair day that day,

47:48.160 --> 47:50.400
but you're able to subconsciously forgive it

47:50.400 --> 47:52.360
because it looked really good the day before.

47:52.360 --> 47:53.460
But when you look at a picture,

47:53.460 --> 47:55.960
you know that that's locked in time forever.

47:55.960 --> 47:57.460
It's always gonna look like that.

47:57.460 --> 47:58.920
So you're way more judgmental.

47:58.920 --> 47:59.760
Oh my God.

47:59.760 --> 48:01.840
So you're saying like the permanence of a photograph

48:01.840 --> 48:03.940
is what makes it look worse?

48:03.940 --> 48:04.780
Yeah.

48:04.780 --> 48:07.000
This is why Facebook needs an option

48:07.000 --> 48:08.600
where like if you get tagged in something,

48:08.600 --> 48:10.440
you have the option to delete it.

48:10.440 --> 48:12.600
Or just a text only Facebook.

48:13.760 --> 48:15.040
How great would that be?

48:15.040 --> 48:16.940
I guess it would have to be called something else

48:16.940 --> 48:17.800
at that point.

48:17.800 --> 48:21.580
Or you could do like an ASCII interpretation of your face.

48:21.580 --> 48:22.420
You know what I mean?

48:22.420 --> 48:24.720
Like maybe an emoticon that you think looks a lot like you.

48:24.720 --> 48:27.420
For me, like 8D because I'm always got those big eyes.

48:27.420 --> 48:29.220
I always got a big smile on my face.

48:30.220 --> 48:31.060
And people were just like,

48:31.060 --> 48:33.600
no, like when they see an 8D,

48:33.600 --> 48:34.720
then it's me.

48:34.720 --> 48:37.140
And sometimes I'll try to put like an M dash

48:37.140 --> 48:39.460
in the middle of it to like signify my nose,

48:39.460 --> 48:41.520
but now it looks like a dick.

48:41.520 --> 48:42.360
Oops.

48:42.360 --> 48:43.680
Oops, that's not what my face looks like.

48:43.680 --> 48:45.640
I don't think, I hope not.

48:45.640 --> 48:48.000
I don't think you have dick face personally,

48:48.000 --> 48:48.820
but I'm your brother.

48:48.820 --> 48:50.960
I'm blinded by my love for you.

48:50.960 --> 48:52.180
Can I just throw this out?

48:52.180 --> 48:55.320
Facebook sometimes really embarrasses me

48:55.320 --> 48:57.440
because sometimes if I'm yelling at someone

48:57.440 --> 48:58.920
in a post or something,

48:58.920 --> 49:02.300
and I am breaking down reasons why I'm mad at them

49:02.300 --> 49:04.720
and I say option A parentheses,

49:04.720 --> 49:06.200
you know, to like separate that out.

49:06.200 --> 49:08.400
And then I put option B parentheses.

49:08.400 --> 49:10.720
It just instantly turns that into a smiley face

49:10.720 --> 49:13.740
with sunglasses, which really cheapens my argument.

49:13.740 --> 49:14.580
Yeah.

49:16.960 --> 49:18.280
It's like you're saying,

49:18.280 --> 49:23.320
hey, because you ruined my wedding and hey.

49:23.320 --> 49:24.160
And what's up?

49:24.160 --> 49:26.320
And here's something a cool guy would say.

49:26.320 --> 49:31.320
Imagine this in my cool guy voice.

49:33.160 --> 49:34.500
You stole my wife.

49:37.040 --> 49:37.880
Hey.

49:39.080 --> 49:40.620
Question.

49:40.620 --> 49:41.460
Hit me.

49:41.460 --> 49:42.360
No, you do it.

49:42.360 --> 49:43.760
I thought you had one.

49:43.760 --> 49:45.360
Read the one about bladder shy.

49:45.360 --> 49:49.360
I'm, it's gonna be hard because I really have to pee.

49:49.360 --> 49:51.080
I'm extremely bladder shy.

49:51.080 --> 49:53.080
I'm only comfortable going at home.

49:53.080 --> 49:55.520
I can go in public restrooms if no one is in there,

49:55.520 --> 49:57.120
but if anyone is in the bathroom,

49:57.120 --> 49:59.640
I can't even go in the stalls.

49:59.640 --> 50:02.200
This is especially a problem at large public events

50:02.200 --> 50:04.000
like sporting events or concerts.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.400
Is there a way to get over this problem

50:05.400 --> 50:06.720
or at least lessen its effects?

50:06.720 --> 50:09.200
That's from Sam Crossfire Quave.

50:09.200 --> 50:11.400
Let me tell you, I used to have the same problem.

50:11.400 --> 50:12.600
Not so much with the stalls thing.

50:12.600 --> 50:14.140
That's fucking crazy.

50:15.120 --> 50:16.840
But in the urinals, definitely.

50:16.840 --> 50:19.600
If there's other people in there, no thanks.

50:19.600 --> 50:21.560
To the extent that like if I'm going in a urinal

50:21.560 --> 50:23.320
in a restroom where nobody else is,

50:23.320 --> 50:25.400
and then I hear somebody like walk up to the door,

50:25.400 --> 50:27.960
my penis is like, and shuts down.

50:29.680 --> 50:34.040
Powering the energon slow.

50:35.440 --> 50:36.800
My penis is a transformer.

50:37.840 --> 50:42.840
And what got me over this is at some point in my life,

50:43.760 --> 50:47.480
I became, I'll say borderline incontinent.

50:47.480 --> 50:52.480
I have a bladder that is capable of holding

50:56.160 --> 51:01.160
like 15 cubic millimeters of liquid at any given time

51:01.160 --> 51:04.080
and then I have to excuse myself.

51:04.080 --> 51:06.200
I have, as I've talked about on the show,

51:06.200 --> 51:11.200
not ashamed to admit it, IBS that is probably deadly

51:11.200 --> 51:16.200
and it's just when it has to,

51:17.200 --> 51:20.080
it's become such a routine thing now,

51:20.080 --> 51:23.680
me using the potty, that if I don't just get it over with,

51:23.680 --> 51:25.660
it would literally be my entire life.

51:25.660 --> 51:28.720
So that is sort of how I got over my nervous bladder,

51:28.720 --> 51:33.720
is that I have taken away any option from my palate.

51:34.820 --> 51:39.780
It's like, it's my way or the pee your pants way.

51:39.780 --> 51:43.040
Let me throw out option smiley face with sunglasses.

51:43.040 --> 51:43.880
Okay.

51:44.960 --> 51:48.720
Travel around with a duffel bag full of your decorations

51:48.720 --> 51:53.000
from your home bathroom, decorate the stall with your stuff

51:53.000 --> 51:54.200
and it'll make you feel more comfortable.

51:54.200 --> 51:56.460
I love that, you hang up the little cross stitch

51:56.460 --> 51:58.160
that says if you tinkle while you sprinkle,

51:58.160 --> 51:59.840
be a sweetie, write the CD.

51:59.840 --> 52:00.720
Yeah.

52:00.720 --> 52:01.640
Just hang it up.

52:01.640 --> 52:03.920
Don't leave that in there though, please.

52:03.920 --> 52:05.680
No, you have to take it with you.

52:05.680 --> 52:08.240
But there's this, oh, you put the toilet seat cover

52:08.240 --> 52:11.520
from your toilet seat on there, you put your mat around it,

52:11.520 --> 52:13.540
you have your potpourri going,

52:13.540 --> 52:15.840
you have your picture of Neil Diamond,

52:15.840 --> 52:18.780
you have your cross stitch and you just go to town.

52:19.680 --> 52:21.120
Everything in there that you just said,

52:21.120 --> 52:23.280
that whole list all was normal.

52:23.280 --> 52:24.920
I just wanted to give you the peace of mind

52:24.920 --> 52:26.640
that all the things that you have in your pee zone

52:26.640 --> 52:28.240
are totally normal.

52:28.240 --> 52:29.080
Thank you.

52:29.080 --> 52:30.440
Sydney always gives me a hard time

52:30.440 --> 52:33.440
because whenever I go to like a new place,

52:33.440 --> 52:35.920
I usually will go to the bathroom right away.

52:35.920 --> 52:37.720
I love to go pee.

52:37.720 --> 52:39.200
You want to scope the sitch.

52:39.200 --> 52:41.600
Also because I'm really socially awkward

52:41.600 --> 52:44.680
and the bathroom's sort of like my safe place

52:44.680 --> 52:45.800
where I can get away from it all.

52:45.800 --> 52:47.600
It's like a little vacation for people.

52:47.600 --> 52:48.800
And there's no problem with pre-planning.

52:48.800 --> 52:51.120
Like Danny Ocean didn't just walk into the Bellagio

52:51.120 --> 52:52.680
and like grab all the shit and walk out.

52:52.680 --> 52:55.640
Like you got to get some blueprints and stuff.

52:55.640 --> 52:57.760
And sometimes they have like a weird toilet.

52:57.760 --> 52:59.960
I went into a bathroom where the urinal was like

52:59.960 --> 53:03.320
this bucket set up thing that they had turned into a toilet.

53:03.320 --> 53:05.280
Like you want to prep for that.

53:05.280 --> 53:06.780
You want to know that ahead of time.

53:06.780 --> 53:07.780
You don't want to get in there

53:07.780 --> 53:09.840
and suddenly you're throwing off your rhythm

53:09.840 --> 53:11.920
because it's like, well, hold on.

53:11.920 --> 53:13.760
And then you've peed your pants.

53:13.760 --> 53:17.400
This problem is especially bad in the sort of environs

53:17.400 --> 53:19.020
that the question Astrid mentioned,

53:19.020 --> 53:21.800
like stadiums and concert venues.

53:21.800 --> 53:24.920
I feel like they are getting worse

53:24.920 --> 53:29.380
about not distinguishing pee zones from hand washing zones.

53:29.380 --> 53:32.080
In the effort to sort of push everyone cattle-like

53:32.080 --> 53:34.480
through the experience,

53:34.480 --> 53:37.120
it is not uncommon to see urinals that look a lot

53:37.120 --> 53:39.000
like hand washing stations and vice versa.

53:39.000 --> 53:42.560
For kids, you go to like an elementary school,

53:42.560 --> 53:44.440
maybe you're voting or something like that.

53:44.440 --> 53:45.600
You go to the bathroom.

53:45.600 --> 53:49.360
You've just peed in a child's sink is what you did there.

53:49.360 --> 53:51.240
You just peed in a child's sink.

53:51.240 --> 53:53.920
What I hate even more because yes, that is awful.

53:53.920 --> 53:55.800
But what I hate is the bathroom planner

53:55.800 --> 53:58.200
who puts this hand washing sink

53:58.200 --> 54:02.120
like directly like six inches away from a urinal.

54:02.120 --> 54:04.920
So that means if person A is washing his hands

54:04.920 --> 54:07.720
and person B is pissing, it's like, oh, hey.

54:07.720 --> 54:08.560
Well, they do that.

54:08.560 --> 54:09.400
I'll be over there in a second.

54:09.400 --> 54:11.120
They do that intentionally

54:11.120 --> 54:13.600
because that way if someone is having a hard time,

54:13.600 --> 54:16.040
you can give them some words of encouragement.

54:16.040 --> 54:16.880
Like, hey.

54:16.880 --> 54:17.720
I've been where you've been.

54:17.720 --> 54:18.640
I've been where you've been.

54:18.640 --> 54:20.240
I got through it and you will too.

54:20.240 --> 54:21.800
Get that pee out of there.

54:21.800 --> 54:24.640
Get it on out and then come over here and wash your hands.

54:24.640 --> 54:25.980
I'm gonna go back out to the movie,

54:25.980 --> 54:28.440
but first I wanted to tell you, you're my big man.

54:28.440 --> 54:29.280
You're my big, big man.

54:29.280 --> 54:30.100
You're my big man.

54:30.100 --> 54:31.320
You can do this.

54:31.320 --> 54:32.940
Okay, enjoy the Wolverine.

54:34.800 --> 54:37.000
I was peeing in a urinal a couple weeks ago.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.920
Tell me more.

54:38.920 --> 54:40.240
Hold on, this is good.

54:40.240 --> 54:42.400
I was peeing in a urinal in a restaurant a couple days ago

54:42.400 --> 54:45.880
and I watched this gentleman out of the corner of my eye.

54:45.880 --> 54:47.240
I don't think he knew I was in the urinal

54:47.240 --> 54:49.200
because he kind of went out of the toilet stall

54:49.200 --> 54:50.500
and went straight to the sink.

54:50.500 --> 54:52.760
And I watched this gentleman from the corner of my eye

54:52.760 --> 54:56.040
turn on the water, wait a second, and then turn it off.

54:56.040 --> 54:59.840
Fucking that guy is on point.

54:59.840 --> 55:01.480
So if he didn't know you were there,

55:01.480 --> 55:04.760
who was that whole act for?

55:04.760 --> 55:05.800
I don't know.

55:05.800 --> 55:08.440
There are other stalls that had closed doors,

55:08.440 --> 55:10.800
so I'm assuming he thought a little show for them

55:10.800 --> 55:13.040
or maybe someone had been walking in.

55:13.040 --> 55:16.360
I don't know who this production was for.

55:16.360 --> 55:20.000
He didn't activate any sort of hand drying afterwards?

55:20.000 --> 55:23.480
Is it possible that he was going to wash his hands

55:23.480 --> 55:24.360
and he turned on the water

55:24.360 --> 55:26.160
and in the second after he turned on the water,

55:26.160 --> 55:29.840
he just went, ah, no, I'm not kidding, and turned it off.

55:29.840 --> 55:30.760
I'm gonna grab the knob.

55:30.760 --> 55:32.240
Why start now, Wayne?

55:32.240 --> 55:33.440
Why start now?

55:33.440 --> 55:35.680
Maybe, and this is totally reasonable.

55:35.680 --> 55:38.920
Maybe he peed in the toilet stall, right?

55:38.920 --> 55:42.280
And listen, it's entirely possible.

55:42.280 --> 55:43.580
Ladies, you might not know about this.

55:43.580 --> 55:45.360
It's entirely possible for a dude

55:45.360 --> 55:47.760
to do that particular business

55:47.760 --> 55:49.880
without touching his zone at all.

55:49.880 --> 55:53.120
You just, you unzip, you flump, you do it,

55:53.120 --> 55:55.760
you pull the pants forward to retract it

55:55.760 --> 55:57.840
and then you zip up, no contact.

55:57.840 --> 55:59.560
So maybe he got up to the sink, turned on the water.

55:59.560 --> 56:01.520
He was like, wait, did I touch my business?

56:01.520 --> 56:02.880
And then he said, no, I didn't.

56:02.880 --> 56:04.240
I'll just go ahead and turn this right off

56:04.240 --> 56:05.640
because your pants aren't dirty.

56:05.640 --> 56:06.480
You know what I mean?

56:06.480 --> 56:07.300
That's true.

56:07.300 --> 56:08.140
It's just the sin that's dirty.

56:08.140 --> 56:10.800
When you touch your zone, you get sin all over your hands.

56:10.800 --> 56:12.800
You gotta wash that off.

56:12.800 --> 56:14.800
But you've almost certainly encountered

56:14.800 --> 56:17.560
some sort of fixture that has been touched

56:17.560 --> 56:19.680
by someone else with dick on their hands.

56:19.680 --> 56:20.520
No, maybe not.

56:20.520 --> 56:23.200
I mean, it's entirely, like shit's super automated now.

56:23.200 --> 56:24.040
That's true.

56:24.040 --> 56:25.040
I'm saying it's entirely possible

56:25.040 --> 56:26.400
to get in and out of the bathroom

56:26.400 --> 56:28.080
without touching nothing but your pants.

56:28.080 --> 56:30.400
And in those situations, I think it's 100% acceptable

56:30.400 --> 56:35.080
to walk out of the doors and keep making that army sandwich.

56:35.080 --> 56:36.640
What if he's hydrophobic?

56:36.640 --> 56:37.920
He might be hydrophobic, too.

56:37.920 --> 56:39.480
Like he was trying to work up his nerve?

56:39.480 --> 56:41.760
This is his little way of facing his fear

56:41.760 --> 56:45.040
and he's on step six, right?

56:45.040 --> 56:47.580
And step six is just turn on the water, Wayne.

56:47.580 --> 56:50.920
You don't have to use it, but just know that it's there.

56:50.920 --> 56:52.240
If you need it.

56:52.240 --> 56:54.280
But you don't because you didn't touch your dick at all.

56:54.280 --> 56:55.120
You're fine.

56:55.120 --> 56:55.940
Go ahead.

56:55.940 --> 56:56.780
That was step five.

56:56.780 --> 56:58.560
Step five was to learn to pee without touching your dick

56:58.560 --> 56:59.480
because he's also dick-phobic.

56:59.480 --> 57:01.120
It's not that hard.

57:01.120 --> 57:02.640
It's super easy.

57:02.640 --> 57:04.720
98% of the time, I do it.

57:06.000 --> 57:07.000
Is this a weird thing?

57:07.000 --> 57:10.040
I've never talked or said any of this shit out loud before,

57:10.040 --> 57:12.240
but I don't think it's that weird of a thing.

57:13.480 --> 57:14.560
I guess it's a weird thing

57:14.560 --> 57:16.760
because you guys are like stymied right now.

57:17.760 --> 57:19.880
No. No, it makes sense.

57:19.880 --> 57:21.480
I know where you're coming from.

57:21.480 --> 57:22.760
Just on plus.

57:22.760 --> 57:23.600
Okay.

57:23.600 --> 57:24.440
It's so common.

57:24.440 --> 57:27.080
It's so normal that you think it doesn't even bear talking.

57:27.080 --> 57:28.360
I don't even think it bears repeating.

57:28.360 --> 57:33.000
Sometimes you do just pee without touching your stuff.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.840
Sometimes you touch it a lot though.

57:34.840 --> 57:38.600
Sometimes you gotta jostle to get the engine going.

57:38.600 --> 57:39.940
Sometimes like first date town,

57:39.940 --> 57:42.300
you can't keep your hands off of it.

57:42.300 --> 57:46.140
Listen, thank you so much for listening to our program.

57:46.140 --> 57:48.040
We hope you have had a good time.

57:48.040 --> 57:51.200
I wanna thank people who have sent us stuff in the mail.

57:51.200 --> 57:53.200
Real quick, dipping into the mailbag.

57:53.200 --> 57:54.240
We have a P.O. Box.

57:54.240 --> 57:58.740
It's P.O. Box 54, Huntington, West Virginia, 25706.

57:58.740 --> 58:02.000
So I wanna thank Corinna Terbs.

58:02.000 --> 58:06.720
She's a beekeeper who sent us some honey

58:06.720 --> 58:08.920
that had been aged in whiskey barrels.

58:08.920 --> 58:10.260
You have not eaten all of it, have you?

58:10.260 --> 58:11.100
There's still some?

58:11.100 --> 58:12.000
No, I saved some.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.440
I can bring it to Griffin's wedding.

58:13.440 --> 58:17.280
Turkenhillapiary at gmail.com is her email address

58:17.280 --> 58:18.800
and she didn't ask for plug or anything.

58:18.800 --> 58:20.280
I just really, I dug it.

58:20.280 --> 58:22.080
So I wanted to tell you guys where you can get it

58:22.080 --> 58:24.200
because she's thinking about going full-time

58:24.200 --> 58:27.240
in the beekeeping game and I say go for it.

58:27.240 --> 58:32.160
Chris Cucciara, Cucciara, yes.

58:32.160 --> 58:33.000
The Cooch?

58:33.000 --> 58:34.440
Chris Cucciara, the Cooch,

58:35.780 --> 58:39.280
sent us boxes of all the monster cereals,

58:39.280 --> 58:40.340
which is amazing.

58:41.560 --> 58:44.660
Matthew Segal sent us a horse and pony

58:44.660 --> 58:46.320
body language phrase book.

58:46.320 --> 58:51.320
Which is so kind, be able to communicate better for them.

58:52.600 --> 58:55.840
Our buddy Martha sent us some pictures,

58:55.840 --> 58:57.420
some prints that she made.

58:59.560 --> 59:04.480
And Cruz Flores sent us some Halloween candy

59:04.480 --> 59:05.740
and it says at the bottom of his note,

59:05.740 --> 59:08.320
it was dictated but not read, which I really appreciate it.

59:08.320 --> 59:12.840
We also got, by the way, I have misplaced the label,

59:12.840 --> 59:16.520
but who sent it to us.

59:16.520 --> 59:21.360
But we got three dog tags that have emblazoned on them

59:21.360 --> 59:24.440
in case of an emergency blast my cash.

59:24.440 --> 59:25.760
Oh, that's amazing.

59:25.760 --> 59:26.600
This is our franchise.

59:26.600 --> 59:27.560
So awesome.

59:27.560 --> 59:29.280
I'll bring those to you guys too.

59:29.280 --> 59:30.320
You guys are amazing.

59:30.320 --> 59:31.240
Yeah, you're all the best.

59:31.240 --> 59:35.260
Thank you all so much for sending us that neat stuff.

59:36.640 --> 59:39.280
And thank you to folks tweeting about the show

salted caramel pretzel pops, and Italian bistro pretzels.

That's my box.

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:31.540

Sawbones with Justin McElroy and Sidney McElroy.

01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:47.180
Probably my favorite show on the network.

01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:48.020
Larry, let's check it out.

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:48.860
Two things.

01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:50.420
Thanks, John Roderick and the Long Winters

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:52.560
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure.

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:54.220
Off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:56.640
You can find it on Amazon.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:57.580
You can find it anywhere.

01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:59.060
Makes a great Christmas present for them

01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:00.900
who have been a fan in your life or anybody

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:02.960
because it's a really good record.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.300
Also, we're not gonna have an episode next week

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:07.860
because I'm getting mail weed.

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:10.300
Will the week after that be our Candle Nights episode

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:12.100
or are we gonna do the Candle Nights episode

01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:13.500
on like the 23rd?

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:15.300
I don't know.

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:16.780
Let's figure that out when we're not

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:18.580
like actively recording an episode.

01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:20.500
Start sending in your Candle Nights questions.

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:21.380
Candle Nights coming up.

01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:23.020
Make sure that you put in the subject

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:24.380
something about Candle Nights

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:25.660
so that I can separate those out.

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:26.500
Don't swear.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:27.580
Don't swear in your questions

01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:29.100
because we don't swear in the answers.

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:31.120
It's our family-friendly episode every year

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:35.300
that is the hardest to record and to edit.

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:38.900
So yeah, seriously, thank you guys all very much

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:40.900
for your love and support.

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:43.700
I feel like I'm getting married to all of you.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.220
You know what I mean?

01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:46.140
Legally, he is.

01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:47.260
Legally, I am getting married

01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:48.820
to everybody who listens to the show.

01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:49.980
So thank you.

01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:53.720
We're all going to have such a lovely family together.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:55.980
All right, Griffin, I'm ready.

01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:56.820
Finally, Yahoo.

01:01:56.820 --> 01:01:57.660
For the last question.

01:01:57.660 --> 01:01:59.660
Finally, Yahoo was sent in by Sean Moran.

01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:00.480
Thanks, Sean.

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:05.480
For the Yahoo Answers user, Mixi Minix, who asks,

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:08.860
is it possible to get sick from farting a lot

01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:10.060
under your covers at night

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:11.860
and then opening them in the morning?

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:15.500
Oh, Justin McElroy.

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:16.940
Oh, Travis McElroy.

01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:18.020
God, I hope not.

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:20.060
It's been my brother and brother and me.

01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:21.420
Kiss your dad.

01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:22.660
Square on the lips.

01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:30.660
Hey, girls, do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna?

01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:41.780
Maximumfun.org.

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:42.860
Comedy and culture.

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:43.900
Artist-owned.

01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:45.100
Listener-supported.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:47.400
My name is Dave.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:48.300
My name is Graham.

01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:51.720
And we're both the hosts of Stop Podcasting Yourself,

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:54.080
which is a podcast from Canada.

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:57.540
In fact, we've won the best podcast in Canada

01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:00.980
two years in a row at the Canadian Comedy Awards.

01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:01.820
Sounds made up.

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:02.820
It does sound made up.

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:06.660
Even as I was saying it, I'm like, did that really happen?

01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:07.900
Here's the thing.

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:11.580
Stop Podcasting Yourself is a very positive show

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:14.940
about two people who hate absolutely everything.

01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:19.780
But we love you and you listening through all this.

01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:21.660
People have already fast forwarded through this part

01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:22.500
of the program.

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:23.320
Anyway, thanks.

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:24.280
We're Stop Podcasting Yourself,

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:53.940
