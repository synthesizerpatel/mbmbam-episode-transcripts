WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:51.520
I just got so scared, boys. Okay. That's not a joke. What is this energy?

00:51.520 --> 01:02.240
I've never been that. Yeah, that. No, no, no. You don't understand it.

01:05.120 --> 01:13.760
What you make as a group when you all do that is a scary sound. It activates my fight or flight

01:13.760 --> 01:23.520
response. And spoiler alert, my brain and body have never chosen fight. For McElroys, it is a

01:24.240 --> 01:31.280
flight response. Yeah. Slider fart. Hello, everybody. Welcome to My Brother, My Brother,

01:31.280 --> 01:34.800
a media advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:34.800 --> 01:47.200
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy. It's not a competition. It's not. I'm

01:47.200 --> 01:59.680
piss pants terrified. I'm Griffin McElroy. All right. Much like so many years ago,

01:59.680 --> 02:06.800
those Chilean miners emerged. They all love so much. We have returned here to the beautiful

02:08.960 --> 02:14.640
is DC technically a city? Is that the right thing to say? Okay. The city of it's just a

02:14.640 --> 02:20.480
loose conglomeration of humans. I'm hearing a hey, I'm hearing a lot of you yell different

02:20.480 --> 02:26.240
things. And that's buckwild. Let's clamp that down. Taxation without representation. Am I right?

02:26.240 --> 02:35.600
The nerve of these fat cats. Anyway, we are so excited to be here. Last night we did

02:35.600 --> 02:44.240
the adventure zone and other podcasts. And well, the road, the road's tough. The road's hard on

02:44.240 --> 02:51.840
all of us in different ways. This is got at this point. This is our second show, this tour

02:51.840 --> 02:58.720
and the road and we're not as young as we used to be as you used to be. And last time I'm sad,

02:58.720 --> 03:02.800
sad to report we did have an injury. Uh, Trav, do you want to talk about it?

03:05.680 --> 03:11.360
I, after the show, I threw slap bracelets into the audience

03:12.960 --> 03:15.280
and I threw them so hard. I hurt my arm.

03:15.280 --> 03:20.800
We've heard about this injury, the slap bracelet injury that Travis sustained

03:20.800 --> 03:26.000
quite a bit this evening. I watched, it hurts to do everything. I watched six episodes of

03:26.000 --> 03:31.920
succession in my hotel room today. I have heard Travis talk about this injury more than I've heard

03:31.920 --> 03:38.080
Brian Cox call his kids fuck wads. So it's like, it's that it hurts to do like, it hurts to undo

03:38.080 --> 03:45.440
my belt to pee. And you wouldn't help me. Yeah, I know Travis. I asked you to help me pee.

03:45.440 --> 03:49.680
We just wasted a lot of your time. We have horrible bodies. Let's get into the show.

03:49.680 --> 03:53.120
They're all broken and nothing works. Riddle me, Piss Boys.

03:57.600 --> 04:03.440
You're just making it worse. You're just injured. Tis but a warm up. Okay, you don't have to do

04:03.440 --> 04:09.120
this right. I won't do the voice for the actual riddle. Then get to the fucking riddle. But this

04:09.120 --> 04:13.680
is tis but the intro. Now I want to actually hear the riddle now because it will put an end to this

04:13.680 --> 04:20.880
misery. Okay, feed me riddle master. Now this, this riddle I picked solely for the answer. All right.

04:20.880 --> 04:28.240
And I will read it, caps appropriately. Jesus Christ. If I say that I will give you a hundred

04:28.240 --> 04:37.360
thousand dollars tomorrow, when will you get it? I'm going to say never. I'm going to say tomorrow.

04:37.360 --> 04:42.320
Okay. This is, I'm going to read it word for word, caps punctual, and I'll scoot this back a little bit.

04:43.600 --> 04:51.360
Never. Tomorrow never ever comes. It's always today.

04:51.360 --> 05:00.000
So now I understand the heart of this riddle, but if a human being said to me, I'll give you a hundred

05:00.000 --> 05:04.640
thousand dollars tomorrow. And then the next day I said, I would like that a hundred thousand

05:04.640 --> 05:10.640
dollars, please. And they said, ha ha, but tis not tomorrow. It is today. I'm like, fuck you, Dylan.

05:10.640 --> 05:18.640
I'm like, fuck you, Dylan. I'm like, fuck you, Dylan. I'm like, fuck you, Dylan. I'm like, fuck you, Dylan.

05:18.640 --> 05:23.760
I'm like, fuck you, Dylan. I'm like, fuck you, Dylan. I'm like, fuck you, Dylan. I'm like, fuck you, Dylan.

05:23.760 --> 05:28.960
You told me yesterday, so it is now, and you do owe me a hundred thousand dollars.

05:28.960 --> 05:35.120
This is a person that has seen that sign that's in every fine bar, the sign that says free beer

05:35.120 --> 05:42.480
tomorrow. They saw that sign and thought, hmm, what a brain teaser. Yeah. The center of my next

05:42.480 --> 05:51.280
conundrum. Or they went and saw rent and just did not fucking understand kind of the whole thesis.

05:52.640 --> 06:01.520
This riddle was written by a dog. It's never later. No day but today. I fucking told you guys,

06:01.520 --> 06:06.960
didn't I? Told you. How about a question one? Can we do one of them? This is a question.

06:06.960 --> 06:13.600
My dad is a hairy, hairy man. Start the question, Juice.

06:16.480 --> 06:22.320
My dad's a hairy, hairy man. So hairy, it doesn't matter how high the neck on his shirt is. The hair

06:22.320 --> 06:28.480
on his chest always manages to poke out of the top of his shirt. Been there. He has a tiny little

06:28.480 --> 06:34.000
dog, very cute, and he frequently sends pictures of her. The problem is he sends selfies of him

06:34.000 --> 06:39.600
and the dog from a low angle, revealing how shirtless and hairy he is with a very serious

06:39.600 --> 06:44.880
dad face. How do I tell my dad to stop sending me shirtless pics so I can show my friends his cute

06:44.880 --> 06:53.600
dog, but not my hairy dad with no shirt that's from desperate daughter? Are you here? All right.

06:53.600 --> 07:02.480
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your decisiveness. What's a serious dad face?

07:03.440 --> 07:09.680
Okay, Trav, let's break down. We're in an audio medium, and also they are in a pitch black room

07:09.680 --> 07:16.000
that we can't see. We've used our words to weave pictures before. Yeah, that's true. I think it's

07:16.000 --> 07:27.680
kind of like this. Okay. God almighty. One of these phones we got now. Hey, what's the deal with

07:27.680 --> 07:32.880
these phones these days? They've got to have some sort of crop functionality, yes? They have to have

07:32.880 --> 07:39.600
some sort of content aware. That's one hairy daddy. That is feature where it just autofills with more

07:39.600 --> 07:48.960
dog. This is a cute tiny dog with one enormous wild man-shaped lump on its back. That is true.

07:48.960 --> 07:53.040
Like there's a thing that I can turn on that turns my head into a unicorn's head. There's

07:53.040 --> 07:59.120
not something I can hit that instantly puts a shirt on your dad. I think next time your dad's

07:59.120 --> 08:02.960
like, hey, I'm sending you a pic, just turn your phone around and hold it up like, guys, I got a

08:02.960 --> 08:07.600
good dad pic coming in. You guys look first. I want to see what you all think. Or maybe just like cut

08:07.600 --> 08:13.600
a tiny shirt out of construction paper and glue it to your phone. That's right. Get the crop exactly

08:13.600 --> 08:21.840
right. Does your dad know? Were you like, hey, especially a low angle. Yeah. Hey, straight up,

08:21.840 --> 08:31.360
nobody's accidentally taken a low angle selfie. He didn't trip on his skateboard and the shutter

08:31.360 --> 08:39.120
button hit with himself perfectly framed rule of thirds. Like, I don't know why you're seeing this

08:39.120 --> 08:43.440
as a problem. I say you set your dad up with an Instagram and let him make a million dollars.

08:43.440 --> 08:52.160
Right. I've been on the internet and your dad's going to find his audience. I have very little

08:52.160 --> 08:57.040
doubt about that. And the dog's hairy too. And you're not giving a shit about that. Thank you.

08:57.040 --> 09:02.240
Yeah. All animals. Think about it. I'm just saying, no matter how hairy your dad is,

09:02.240 --> 09:09.280
not as hairy as that dog. Get him. Unless. Unless. Oh, no. Dad's got to get a bigger dog.

09:09.840 --> 09:17.360
Solved it for you. Is your dad shirtless? I cannot tell. Can you get a dog that exactly

09:17.360 --> 09:22.800
matches the color of his chest hair? Then it becomes like an I Spy poster.

09:22.800 --> 09:29.760
If there's a dog in there, I swear, cross your eyes. Yeah. That's funny.

09:32.560 --> 09:38.960
Thanks, Larry the Cable Guy. Lord, I apologize for our great...

09:38.960 --> 09:43.760
There's a... Every time I drink wine on stage, and it's a new thing for me,

09:43.760 --> 09:50.240
I'm an adult now and I like the stinky red beverage. But every time I do, bugs are like,

09:50.240 --> 09:55.280
what's up? You doing a show? Can I get in that? And it's very distracting. I'm just going to

09:55.280 --> 09:59.120
drink a bug and not even worry about it. Free protein.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.560
I got a Yahoo. Can I do a Yahoo? Yeah, bud.

10:04.880 --> 10:08.480
So I'm going to send in by Seth Carlson. Thank you, Seth. It's Yahoo Answers user,

10:08.480 --> 10:14.320
Soups, who asks. That's S-O-U-P-S. Not like Superman shorts.

10:14.320 --> 10:19.760
You know what? It never crossed my mind. I assumed it was S-O-U-P-S.

10:19.760 --> 10:25.120
Multiple Soups. Okay. His avatar is the Hamburglar. There's a lot going on with this.

10:25.840 --> 10:32.080
Anyway, Soups asks, could a gorilla become a vampire?

10:32.080 --> 10:47.120
Followed by, are vampires only human or can they be any mammals?

10:49.440 --> 10:52.880
Wow. That actually opens up the door. Humans, bats.

10:55.440 --> 11:00.640
Travis couldn't think of a third mammal, everybody. No, hold on. I'm saying vampires

11:00.640 --> 11:06.800
are already humans and bats. Oh, okay. Please stop yelling mammals or anything.

11:10.240 --> 11:15.040
The better question is, how hungry does a vampire have to be?

11:17.520 --> 11:25.200
Before he's like, oh, fuck. I have to eat something. Why did we come to this place

11:25.200 --> 11:33.840
where there are so many gorillas? I'm going to do it, Vicky. I'm going to eat a gorilla.

11:36.720 --> 11:39.360
It's the most dude-shaped animal.

11:42.800 --> 11:47.760
Maybe it's the thrill at that point. It's like, humans, we're pretty easy.

11:47.760 --> 11:49.600
We're fucking weak. We're weak.

11:49.600 --> 11:53.200
I've seen a lot of vampire movies. Nine out of ten of us are easy to take down.

11:53.200 --> 11:56.080
And I've had a lot of conversation about this. Statistically speaking,

11:56.080 --> 11:59.360
about half of the people would be like, yeah, okay. It's all right.

12:00.640 --> 12:03.520
And a gorilla is like, oh, if that gets you, though.

12:05.600 --> 12:09.520
I kind of now want to see a gorilla fight a Dracula. That would be very good.

12:09.520 --> 12:12.240
I think we've got a little old lady who swallowed a fly situation in our hands,

12:12.240 --> 12:17.440
as we so often do on this show, where the gorillas are going to wipe out a lot of

12:17.440 --> 12:20.720
the vampire population when they try to get froggy and leap.

12:20.720 --> 12:26.080
Yes, but the few that succeed are going to make fucking vampire gorillas.

12:27.760 --> 12:30.880
Hey, what are we going to vampirize to kill the vampire gorillas?

12:30.880 --> 12:34.960
Hey, why stop there? What about a vampirino?

12:34.960 --> 12:36.640
Vampirino is bad news.

12:36.640 --> 12:38.320
They suck it through the horn.

12:39.040 --> 12:39.840
Shit, dog.

12:41.520 --> 12:43.520
They're not going to turn any humans, though,

12:43.520 --> 12:46.240
because there's not going to be a vampire with a hole in its torso.

12:46.960 --> 12:49.600
What about a vampire whale?

12:49.600 --> 12:50.640
Vampire whale?

12:50.640 --> 12:52.000
All that fucking baleen?

12:54.480 --> 12:56.720
Oh, the baleen's just kind of sharp now.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.400
Yeah, I'm just chilling in here like a hammock.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.360
My juices are being drained, but...

13:01.360 --> 13:03.920
There's a lot of vampire krill running around now.

13:03.920 --> 13:07.600
If they do a vampire duckbill platypus, is it just going to gum you to death?

13:07.600 --> 13:09.920
Is it going to be something on you?

13:09.920 --> 13:12.320
Well, it already has poisonous spines on its feet.

13:13.440 --> 13:16.080
Perhaps they just migrate up to its mouth now.

13:16.960 --> 13:17.520
Gross.

13:17.520 --> 13:20.160
Let me walk on you, Dylan.

13:20.160 --> 13:21.360
Let me walk on your back.

13:22.000 --> 13:22.560
Trust me.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.400
How about another question?

13:24.400 --> 13:25.040
Yes, my son.

13:25.840 --> 13:26.340
What?

13:27.200 --> 13:28.080
Twist.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.520
It's a big reveal.

13:29.520 --> 13:30.800
No one saw this coming.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.000
So late in the shit series.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.360
I was wondering if you have any advice on how to ask my friends

13:35.360 --> 13:38.080
if I can massage them in a non-creepy way.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.800
For the last year or so,

13:40.800 --> 13:44.480
I have been watching massage tutorial videos on YouTube to relax before bed.

13:44.480 --> 13:47.600
And I feel like I have gained a lot of knowledge on the subject

13:47.600 --> 13:48.880
and want to practice the skills.

13:51.360 --> 13:54.640
I don't want anyone to think I'm a creep or a weirdo.

13:54.640 --> 13:55.760
No danger of that.

13:56.560 --> 13:59.040
I just think it would be a fun skill to have.

13:59.760 --> 14:00.800
What do I do?

14:00.800 --> 14:02.560
How can I offer this to my friends?

14:02.560 --> 14:06.320
And that's from amateur massage therapist in Silver Spring.

14:06.320 --> 14:06.880
Are you here?

14:08.320 --> 14:09.040
Okay, hello.

14:09.040 --> 14:14.240
Now, it occurs to me, as my older brother is reading this question,

14:14.800 --> 14:17.520
that you've watched a lot of videos

14:18.080 --> 14:23.120
and have done no practical, like, experience at all.

14:23.120 --> 14:26.160
So you've watched and you've kind of moved your hands in the air.

14:27.120 --> 14:30.400
I'm like, that's what I would kind of do on some skin.

14:30.400 --> 14:31.120
That seems right.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.440
It's like practicing a kiss on a teddy bear, isn't it?

14:34.320 --> 14:35.520
Except there's no teddy bear.

14:35.520 --> 14:36.320
You're just kind of...

14:36.320 --> 14:39.600
Yeah, I just mouth in the air.

14:39.600 --> 14:47.440
So, uh, you, I...

14:49.680 --> 14:52.000
The way you're going to have to phrase it is,

14:52.800 --> 14:58.160
can I massage you for the first time ever?

14:58.160 --> 14:59.440
I want to practice my art.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.680
Well, hold on, because that makes it sound like

15:01.680 --> 15:03.040
you have massaged other people,

15:03.040 --> 15:04.880
but you are treating better people.

15:04.880 --> 15:08.000
But you are treating them specifically for the first time.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
You would have to phrase it something wild like,

15:10.000 --> 15:15.440
can I, for the first time, massage and have it be you?

15:17.840 --> 15:21.280
May I offer you my first ever massage?

15:21.280 --> 15:25.040
Wow, we all forgot syntax except for Travis up here for a bit.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.000
But there is also, like,

15:27.360 --> 15:31.440
if any one of my friends started a sentence with,

15:31.440 --> 15:34.160
you know, I've been learning about massage,

15:34.160 --> 15:37.280
they wouldn't finish before I was like, do it.

15:37.280 --> 15:38.000
Do it, go.

15:39.120 --> 15:41.200
Everything is stressful all the time.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.880
I know 800 people.

15:42.880 --> 15:45.760
And if any one of them came up to me and said,

15:46.480 --> 15:47.200
do you want a massage?

15:47.200 --> 15:48.160
I'd say, oh, absolutely.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.120
Thank you so much.

15:49.120 --> 15:52.320
And that's Justin who is rife with social anxiety.

15:52.320 --> 15:54.880
Oh, that's not, I'll take a massage though.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.640
That gets rid of all the anxiety.

15:56.640 --> 15:57.760
I mean, I hurt myself.

15:58.960 --> 15:59.760
Oh, Travis, yeah.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.360
Hey bud, let me see that arm.

16:01.360 --> 16:03.520
Yeah, I hurt myself throwing slap bracelets.

16:03.520 --> 16:04.480
Is it this one?

16:04.480 --> 16:05.840
It's both of them, Griffin.

16:07.760 --> 16:09.040
Here's some quick advice.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.680
One, don't open with,

16:11.680 --> 16:14.480
I'm not asking this in a weird or creepy way,

16:14.480 --> 16:16.800
but that's number one.

16:16.800 --> 16:22.240
Number two, massage is an art and a technique

16:22.240 --> 16:25.040
and perhaps a science if I may be so bold.

16:25.040 --> 16:26.800
I would maybe take a class.

16:26.800 --> 16:29.840
It would be a fun, fun place to start.

16:29.840 --> 16:33.040
Number three, if you're really serious and you say,

16:33.040 --> 16:35.120
hey, I'm an amateur massage therapist

16:35.120 --> 16:35.920
because aren't we all?

16:38.240 --> 16:39.760
I'm an amateur massage therapist.

16:39.760 --> 16:42.800
My first fucking question is show me the table.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.240
If you've got one of those weird tables

16:44.240 --> 16:45.920
and I just looked on Amazon, they're $84.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.360
And you know what that is, Justin?

16:49.360 --> 16:50.000
An investment.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.440
Investment in your future.

16:51.440 --> 16:54.480
You could do all kinds of stuff on a massage table.

16:54.480 --> 16:57.280
Why don't other pieces, fucking chill.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.240
Okay, a list of some things you could do.

17:02.240 --> 17:06.480
Number two, take a nap with a straw to a drink underneath.

17:06.480 --> 17:08.560
Or just take a, hey everybody, we're all talking.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.320
Do you sleep on your side or do you sleep on your back?

17:10.320 --> 17:12.240
I sleep on my fucking front.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.240
I sleep on my front with a hole for the head.

17:14.240 --> 17:15.440
I watch TV.

17:15.440 --> 17:16.640
I watch TV down there.

17:16.640 --> 17:20.080
My TV's on the fucking floor, re-watching Breaking Bad.

17:20.080 --> 17:23.040
I fall asleep gently breathing through my good hole.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.280
If I roll three inches either way, I die.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.440
I am strapped to the bed.

17:27.440 --> 17:29.200
I'm strapped to the bed, yes, it's very safe.

17:29.200 --> 17:32.160
It's the friend I trust.

17:32.160 --> 17:35.040
What if you wake up and your butt looks awesome

17:35.040 --> 17:36.720
and everybody's like, your butt looks so awesome.

17:36.720 --> 17:37.760
And you're like, yeah, I guess just,

17:37.760 --> 17:39.200
you're not supposed to sleep on it.

17:39.200 --> 17:41.360
We weren't supposed to sleep on it this whole time.

17:42.240 --> 17:44.240
So yeah, it looks really cool and good.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.640
Like, I look bigger and it looks good.

17:47.680 --> 17:50.880
Are there not practice dummies?

17:51.920 --> 17:54.560
One could, I know I'm saying it out loud.

17:56.160 --> 17:57.440
No, this is good, Travis.

17:57.440 --> 18:00.080
They're rubbing them and they're like, oh, that's good.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.600
Yes, excellent.

18:01.600 --> 18:02.720
That is the spot.

18:02.720 --> 18:04.000
That is perfect right there.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.360
Whoa, whoa, no, not there.

18:05.360 --> 18:08.240
Oh, oh, I can't move my legs.

18:08.240 --> 18:09.760
I'm peeing forever now.

18:09.760 --> 18:10.720
I'm peeing forever.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.080
I'll never stop peeing.

18:12.080 --> 18:17.040
And then it says, game over on the scoreboard.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.240
Coming to arcades this far.

18:22.240 --> 18:23.840
Massage, massage revolution.

18:24.560 --> 18:25.380
That's good.

18:25.380 --> 18:27.380
Rub rabbits.

18:27.380 --> 18:31.140
I, uh, Griffy, you wanna do another question?

18:31.140 --> 18:31.700
Yeah, sure.

18:31.700 --> 18:33.460
This one was sent in by Emma Kant.

18:34.340 --> 18:34.740
Thank you.

18:34.740 --> 18:36.580
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

18:38.500 --> 18:42.660
So I'm gonna call them Jeremiah asks.

18:43.540 --> 18:45.380
My brain stopped working for a second there.

18:47.060 --> 18:49.940
Am I allowed to buy all the Super Bowl tickets

18:49.940 --> 18:56.660
to have the stadium to myself?

18:56.660 --> 18:59.540
This is Jeremy's big game.

19:00.900 --> 19:02.580
Have fun out there, guys.

19:03.540 --> 19:05.220
Go Broncos, go Jets.

19:05.220 --> 19:05.780
I don't care.

19:05.780 --> 19:08.660
Just have fun for Jeremy.

19:08.660 --> 19:10.260
Make it a good game.

19:10.260 --> 19:13.380
I have to think that this is an air bud situation, right?

19:13.940 --> 19:17.860
Where Jeremiah would roll up, say, here is, I don't know,

19:17.860 --> 19:20.660
$1.8 million or whatever.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.300
Probably considerably more than that.

19:23.300 --> 19:28.660
You think the gross take for the Super Bowl is $1.8 million?

19:28.660 --> 19:31.540
You think buying out the Super Bowl costs less

19:31.540 --> 19:33.860
than buying a commercial on the Super Bowl?

19:33.860 --> 19:39.620
You think if Coke could pay 50,000 dipshits

19:39.620 --> 19:41.060
to stand around in red and white shirts

19:41.060 --> 19:43.380
that spell out Coke they wouldn't in a fucking heartbeat?

19:43.380 --> 19:47.460
You're right, $2 million.

19:47.460 --> 19:49.220
Then I think that there will be a scenario

19:49.220 --> 19:51.300
in which the Super Bowl officials would go,

19:51.300 --> 19:55.460
what, I mean, wait, hold on, let us look.

19:56.500 --> 19:57.700
There's no rule against it.

19:58.260 --> 20:00.260
Yeah, it's your game now.

20:01.220 --> 20:04.660
I have to step in here and break out of the bit a little bit

20:04.660 --> 20:13.460
to say Travis's understanding of all law and order is defined

20:13.460 --> 20:15.220
by the air bud clause.

20:15.220 --> 20:23.220
Specifically, if there's not a rule against it, it's fine.

20:23.220 --> 20:25.620
Yeah, that's how new rules get written.

20:25.620 --> 20:26.420
There has to be that.

20:26.420 --> 20:28.260
To stop people like Travis.

20:28.260 --> 20:31.060
That's air bud six.

20:31.060 --> 20:34.420
It's like, the dog's gonna join this basketball team.

20:34.420 --> 20:35.300
No, they're fucking not.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.580
No rule against it.

20:36.580 --> 20:38.100
Okay, hey, guys, get together.

20:38.100 --> 20:39.620
I don't think dogs should be able to play basketball.

20:39.620 --> 20:41.620
Here, aye, aye, aye, aye.

20:41.620 --> 20:43.220
Yeah, so fuck off.

20:43.220 --> 20:44.180
That's actually-

20:44.180 --> 20:46.820
We used to only have the midnight amendments.

20:46.820 --> 20:49.620
So where we started was come on, be cool, nice.

20:49.620 --> 20:53.540
And then the Travis's of human civilization

20:53.540 --> 20:54.980
started pushing the boundaries.

20:54.980 --> 20:55.780
Well, this is what I'm saying.

20:55.780 --> 20:59.140
Maybe air bud seven is just like air bud on a search

20:59.140 --> 21:01.780
for things he hasn't been legally ruled out of yet.

21:01.780 --> 21:02.580
Yes.

21:02.580 --> 21:03.780
Can I be a doctor?

21:03.780 --> 21:07.380
No, we have a law against, oh shit, I'm gonna be a teacher.

21:07.380 --> 21:09.140
No, we got you there too, you asshole.

21:10.100 --> 21:12.420
We saw you coming a mile away.

21:12.420 --> 21:13.620
Can I be a firefighter?

21:13.620 --> 21:15.220
You can be like a firefighter mascot.

21:15.220 --> 21:16.580
I'm not exactly sure how it works.

21:16.580 --> 21:17.460
Ah, no rule.

21:17.460 --> 21:18.500
Ah, boom.

21:18.500 --> 21:19.940
Spray, spray, spray, spray.

21:19.940 --> 21:21.220
I get to kill again.

21:21.220 --> 21:26.580
Because you can't send a dog to death row.

21:26.580 --> 21:27.940
It's not in the law books.

21:27.940 --> 21:30.180
One of the, you know, you're buying yourself

21:30.180 --> 21:31.860
all the tickets to the Super Bowl and that's great.

21:31.860 --> 21:33.220
But what you've also bought yourself,

21:33.220 --> 21:37.300
is a private concert from Shakira and Jennifer Lopez.

21:37.300 --> 21:38.020
Yes.

21:38.020 --> 21:39.620
Who are doing the halftime show this year.

21:39.620 --> 21:41.620
If we are the arbiters of this news to you.

21:41.620 --> 21:42.100
Yes.

21:42.100 --> 21:44.100
Lucky that Derek is small and humble,

21:44.100 --> 21:46.420
so I don't confuse him with mountains.

21:46.980 --> 21:48.020
What was his name?

21:48.020 --> 21:48.820
Derek.

21:48.820 --> 21:50.740
It didn't fit the meter very well.

21:50.740 --> 21:52.260
Waiting for Derek.

21:52.260 --> 21:53.220
Whoa.

21:53.220 --> 21:54.180
Is that better?

21:54.820 --> 21:56.980
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got.

21:56.980 --> 21:58.980
I'm still Derek from the block.

22:00.340 --> 22:01.860
All the songs will be about Derek.

22:01.860 --> 22:03.300
They would all work for Derek.

22:03.300 --> 22:04.900
I will give you a hundred dollars

22:04.900 --> 22:07.860
if you name another Shakira song and fit Derek into it.

22:08.420 --> 22:08.900
Okay.

22:08.900 --> 22:12.660
I'm mounted not, you know Derek don't lie.

22:12.660 --> 22:13.860
Don't lie to me.

22:13.860 --> 22:15.060
That's the same song.

22:15.060 --> 22:16.900
That's, it's a different, no.

22:16.900 --> 22:17.860
No.

22:17.860 --> 22:18.900
That's the same song.

22:18.900 --> 22:20.020
You know, it's hard to say Trav.

22:20.740 --> 22:23.380
It's definitely a different part of the same song if anything.

22:23.380 --> 22:25.300
Okay, I'll give you $50.

22:25.300 --> 22:26.260
Thank you.

22:26.260 --> 22:27.220
Tomorrow?

22:27.220 --> 22:27.700
Tomorrow.

22:27.700 --> 22:33.860
Tomorrow.

22:33.860 --> 22:37.540
As a child, I, this isn't a question.

22:37.540 --> 22:37.860
Sorry.

22:37.860 --> 22:38.340
Oh.

22:38.340 --> 22:38.740
Should have.

22:39.300 --> 22:43.940
As a child, I stole a toy from a restaurant in Philadelphia.

22:43.940 --> 22:46.180
My mom found out and made me put it back

22:46.180 --> 22:47.940
and apologize to the owner.

22:47.940 --> 22:59.620
And while I was in there, I stole a different toy.

22:59.620 --> 23:03.780
She still doesn't know this was 10 years ago.

23:05.300 --> 23:06.740
It's still haunts me.

23:06.740 --> 23:07.620
Please help.

23:07.620 --> 23:12.900
And that's, that's from Liam who just used their name.

23:12.900 --> 23:16.740
No regard for their own safety.

23:16.740 --> 23:18.020
Liam, are you here?

23:18.020 --> 23:18.500
Yes.

23:22.500 --> 23:26.660
Liam, quick follow up question based on the subject line of the email.

23:26.660 --> 23:30.660
The toy in question, is it a Shrek toy?

23:31.780 --> 23:32.420
Yes.

23:32.420 --> 23:33.380
Liam says yes.

23:33.380 --> 23:34.020
That was a yes.

23:34.020 --> 23:34.820
That was a confirmation.

23:34.820 --> 23:36.660
That's a yes to the Shrek toy.

23:36.660 --> 23:38.180
Was it Donkey?

23:39.380 --> 23:39.940
What?

23:39.940 --> 23:46.180
The first was a Lightning McQueen toy.

23:46.180 --> 23:46.820
Holy shit.

23:46.820 --> 23:48.420
This was terrifyingly recent.

23:48.420 --> 23:53.540
What was, what was the second toy?

23:53.540 --> 23:54.340
Absolute silence.

23:56.980 --> 23:57.940
Was a Shrek action.

23:57.940 --> 24:00.580
So it was, you really trade it up.

24:00.580 --> 24:03.140
So yeah, up to the winning Dreamworks team.

24:03.140 --> 24:10.260
We are really stretching the definition of action with that one, huh?

24:10.260 --> 24:13.860
Watch as he uses his stay away from other people action.

24:15.220 --> 24:16.820
Wants to be left alone action.

24:17.940 --> 24:19.700
I mean, he stomps a dragon.

24:20.580 --> 24:23.700
But on accident, that's all leading up to him being an introvert.

24:23.700 --> 24:25.060
He just wants to be left alone.

24:25.060 --> 24:27.780
And everyone else is forcing social interaction upon him.

24:27.780 --> 24:29.220
And we're supposed to side with them.

24:30.020 --> 24:31.860
You want to just recap all the Shrek movies?

24:31.860 --> 24:35.620
I'm just saying that maybe Shrek just wants to be left alone and that's okay.

24:35.620 --> 24:37.300
Do Shrek Forever After next.

24:40.980 --> 24:41.860
Don't you applaud.

24:41.860 --> 24:44.820
If Shrek is left alone, there's no films for us to enjoy.

24:45.940 --> 24:47.380
You know it and I know it, okay?

24:47.380 --> 24:48.900
I'm sorry Shrek was made uncomfortable.

24:48.900 --> 24:52.900
But in the end, pushing past Shrek's boundaries is very healthy for anyone.

24:52.900 --> 24:54.580
Healthy for the movie industry.

24:54.580 --> 24:56.660
Healthy for Jeffrey Katzenberg's bottom line.

24:57.780 --> 24:58.740
Here's what you do.

24:58.740 --> 25:03.060
You bring your mom into a parlor room and you sit her down and say,

25:03.620 --> 25:07.380
Mother, the great game is finally ended.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.020
As the clock strikes midnight.

25:10.660 --> 25:13.780
And now the 10 year statue of limitations has passed.

25:15.060 --> 25:18.500
I can reveal to you my most perfect crime.

25:18.500 --> 25:19.220
It is a-

25:19.220 --> 25:20.500
My beloved toy.

25:20.500 --> 25:23.060
You remember my most beloved toy, Shrump?

25:23.060 --> 25:26.020
Well, if you remove his mustache.

25:26.020 --> 25:29.620
I did not, I did not.

25:30.980 --> 25:35.380
It is the, it is the green ogre, Shrek.

25:36.420 --> 25:40.900
I did not fashion him together for my straps of burlap and calico as I once promised.

25:40.900 --> 25:44.580
No, it was manufactured and I stole him fair and square, Mother.

25:45.140 --> 25:48.260
While I distracted you with my first crime at the Cracker Barrel,

25:49.300 --> 25:51.700
you paid no attention to the actual heist.

25:51.700 --> 25:55.460
And that is how I got revenge on the man who ruined my father.

25:55.460 --> 25:56.100
Hey.

25:56.100 --> 25:57.220
Ruined my father?

25:57.220 --> 25:57.700
Yeah.

25:57.700 --> 25:58.900
Was it a Cracker Barrel?

25:58.900 --> 26:01.140
Because that seems like the only restaurant where you steal toys.

26:03.540 --> 26:04.180
Wait.

26:04.180 --> 26:05.460
Oh, you actually want to answer.

26:05.460 --> 26:06.500
I'm just, I'm curious.

26:07.940 --> 26:08.980
Now Liam is left.

26:08.980 --> 26:10.260
Liam was so embarrassed.

26:10.260 --> 26:10.740
Wait a minute.

26:10.740 --> 26:11.860
Now he's being chased by the cops!

26:11.860 --> 26:12.820
Where's my fucking wallet?

26:17.060 --> 26:21.460
I mean, here's, here's, uh, I still have a lot of questions.

26:21.460 --> 26:23.540
I feel like 10 years is a good amount of time.

26:23.540 --> 26:31.300
I also feel like once you are post 30, you can casually bring up like a time you got

26:31.300 --> 26:36.500
so high at the University of Michigan campus that you slept under a tree in your gym shorts

26:36.500 --> 26:37.620
in front of your dad.

26:37.620 --> 26:41.300
And it's like, I'm an adult man.

26:41.300 --> 26:42.820
I'm an adult and it happened.

26:42.820 --> 26:44.660
Yeah, but you didn't, you weren't there.

26:44.660 --> 26:46.100
You did not catch me.

26:46.100 --> 26:46.740
Griffin White.

26:46.740 --> 26:48.420
Double jeopardy, baby.

26:48.420 --> 26:49.940
What are you implying there?

26:49.940 --> 26:52.740
Because Liam has told us this happened 10 years ago.

26:52.740 --> 26:58.020
And so what you're saying is at age 20, Liam stole a Shrek toy from a restaurant.

27:02.980 --> 27:04.020
I just had to have it.

27:05.860 --> 27:09.460
Liam, if you still have the toy, you know what you have to do.

27:10.900 --> 27:15.860
You have to go back to the restaurant and fall in love with the owner's child.

27:15.860 --> 27:19.700
What? It's a cute story on Reddit.

27:19.700 --> 27:21.540
Okay, I guess.

27:22.980 --> 27:24.340
Travis ruined my train of thought.

27:24.340 --> 27:25.220
Nevermind, Liam.

27:25.940 --> 27:28.020
Just throw it in the garbage and move on with your life.

27:30.420 --> 27:34.260
I will say the good news, Liam, if you have reached adulthood and the worst thing you've

27:34.260 --> 27:40.340
done so far in your life is take a Shrek toy from a restaurant, you're doing okay.

27:40.340 --> 27:45.140
After stealing a Lightning McQueen, I feel like two steals in one trip is kind of up there.

27:45.140 --> 27:46.580
It only counts as one steal.

27:49.620 --> 27:52.260
They stole a toy from a restaurant.

27:52.260 --> 27:56.900
Hey, Liam, if you walk into a restaurant and you're like, hey, what's up?

27:56.900 --> 27:57.620
I'm a thief.

27:58.580 --> 28:00.100
Sorry, my mom's busted me.

28:00.100 --> 28:02.900
You didn't, but here's your Lightning McQueen back.

28:02.900 --> 28:08.260
If they're not watching you like a fucking hawk after that, like, hey, watch that little

28:08.260 --> 28:12.900
idiot clear the front door because I do not trust his sticky fingers.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.100
That's on them.

28:14.100 --> 28:15.780
They basically gave it to you.

28:15.780 --> 28:19.460
Yeah, maybe they were actually super excited you took the Shrek.

28:19.460 --> 28:21.860
They're like, we've been trying to get rid of that Shrek forever.

28:21.860 --> 28:25.060
We have that sweet honey pot just waiting for someone to steal it.

28:25.060 --> 28:25.540
Thank you.

28:26.100 --> 28:27.700
We hate that green ogre.

28:30.580 --> 28:31.380
For insurance.

28:31.380 --> 28:32.820
Somebody said for insurance.

28:33.780 --> 28:37.220
They insured that Shrek doll for millions of dollars.

28:37.220 --> 28:44.260
Finally, someone fell for it.

28:45.220 --> 28:48.260
This one was hand kissed by Mike Myers.

28:51.380 --> 28:53.540
I have a Yahoo here that was sent in by Max.

28:53.540 --> 28:54.660
Thank you, Max.

28:54.660 --> 28:57.700
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user who I'm going to call.

28:57.700 --> 29:05.940
Paul asks,

29:11.060 --> 29:14.180
Paul, would you want a hallway full of vending machines?

29:14.900 --> 29:18.500
So when guests come over, you can make yourself a nice little profit.

29:18.500 --> 29:27.860
Let's just go straight down the line.

29:27.860 --> 29:28.740
No discussion yet.

29:28.740 --> 29:29.940
Paul, yes or no?

29:29.940 --> 29:31.380
Would I do it?

29:31.380 --> 29:32.740
Would you want it?

29:32.740 --> 29:33.940
Paul, yes or no?

29:33.940 --> 29:36.100
As a guest or as a homeowner?

29:36.100 --> 29:36.980
As a homeowner.

29:39.780 --> 29:40.100
Yeah.

29:40.660 --> 29:41.140
Yes.

29:41.140 --> 29:42.020
Yeah, okay.

29:43.060 --> 29:44.180
I think so.

29:44.180 --> 29:45.140
Here's my argument.

29:45.140 --> 29:51.940
I'm, as Travis has so cavalierly thrown out, can be uncomfortable in some situations,

29:51.940 --> 29:52.900
socially speaking.

29:54.500 --> 29:58.580
If I didn't have to ask somebody for a Diet Coke and I just had to go put fucking a dollar

29:58.580 --> 30:00.340
in the machine, I'd be stoked as hell.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.980
I don't have to ask people for anything.

30:02.980 --> 30:04.820
I can just buy my own Kit Kat.

30:04.820 --> 30:05.940
Fuck yes, I would.

30:05.940 --> 30:06.740
Absolutely.

30:06.740 --> 30:08.020
That's a great host.

30:08.020 --> 30:10.500
They've cut down one uncomfortable interaction.

30:10.500 --> 30:14.340
If there was like a place I could pay to pee, that would be great.

30:14.340 --> 30:14.900
Pee?

30:14.900 --> 30:16.420
That would be ideal for me.

30:16.420 --> 30:16.900
I just-

30:17.540 --> 30:19.220
Because then you feel like you belong there.

30:19.220 --> 30:20.740
I'm supposed to eat this.

30:20.740 --> 30:21.540
I own it.

30:21.540 --> 30:22.100
I own this.

30:22.100 --> 30:23.140
I bought this from you.

30:23.140 --> 30:28.260
This is unprecedented because I've just thought of a way to answer an actual question

30:28.260 --> 30:29.540
with a Yahoo answer.

30:30.100 --> 30:35.700
It's a sort of synthesis we've never done before, but you could put little index cards

30:35.700 --> 30:45.620
in the little spirals that say good for one massage.

30:45.620 --> 30:46.340
Okay.

30:47.780 --> 30:48.340
Okay.

30:49.860 --> 30:50.420
Huh.

30:50.420 --> 30:51.700
Ouroboros.

30:51.700 --> 30:52.820
The snake eats its tail.

30:52.820 --> 30:54.980
Nope, it's a straightforward snake.

30:54.980 --> 30:55.860
It's just a snake.

30:55.860 --> 30:57.220
But I mean what you did just right there.

30:57.220 --> 30:59.060
A snake eats another snake.

30:59.060 --> 30:59.560
Yes.

31:01.220 --> 31:02.420
That could be good.

31:02.420 --> 31:03.460
Oh man.

31:03.460 --> 31:05.220
It depends on what kind of vending machines.

31:05.220 --> 31:05.940
Yes.

31:05.940 --> 31:09.940
We had one vending machine at the high school I went to, Huntington High.

31:09.940 --> 31:10.900
Go Highlanders.

31:10.900 --> 31:15.060
I guess I was never very enthusiastic about your sports when I was there, so I don't know

31:15.060 --> 31:17.460
why I would like 16 years removed.

31:17.460 --> 31:26.340
But anyway, we had a Fruitopia vending machine way past Fruitopia's tragic death.

31:28.100 --> 31:29.540
Where were they getting it?

31:29.540 --> 31:29.940
What?

31:29.940 --> 31:30.660
Where were they getting it?

31:30.660 --> 31:31.620
That's a good question.

31:31.620 --> 31:32.820
It was all the same ones, just leftover.

31:32.820 --> 31:35.460
It may have just been the same Fruitopia.

31:35.460 --> 31:39.300
If memory serves, it was all sold out except for one flavor, and that flavor must have

31:39.300 --> 31:40.660
been fucking bad.

31:42.260 --> 31:47.220
At my middle school, they had a vending machine that only sold cans of guava juice,

31:48.820 --> 31:52.100
which sounds bougie, but they all look like they were made in 1970s.

31:52.100 --> 31:52.340
Yeah.

31:53.060 --> 31:58.420
But if you get one of those vending machines that have like lifesavers up top and Pop-Tarts

31:58.420 --> 32:02.660
at the bottom for some reason, that's the only two things I need.

32:02.660 --> 32:06.740
But that's terrifying when the lifesavers are on top because you know it's dust by

32:06.740 --> 32:08.020
the time it gets to the bottom.

32:08.980 --> 32:13.620
That is a long fall for lifesavers to make and like survive.

32:13.620 --> 32:14.580
Let me hit you with this.

32:15.140 --> 32:17.860
Giant vending machine, nothing but condoms.

32:17.860 --> 32:19.700
What is being messaged there?

32:19.700 --> 32:20.820
That's my question to you.

32:20.820 --> 32:22.740
Why does it have to be giant?

32:24.260 --> 32:27.460
How many varietals are included here?

32:27.460 --> 32:32.580
Because Travis, a small vending machine full of condoms isn't very funny.

32:32.580 --> 32:39.620
I would actually argue that one condom-sized vending machine with one row of condoms.

32:40.740 --> 32:44.020
Or just one condom in it and it costs $500.

32:46.340 --> 32:49.940
I feel like if you have a one condom vending machine, that's being judgmental.

32:49.940 --> 32:51.940
That's like putting it behind a paywall.

32:51.940 --> 32:53.860
You should just be giving those things away.

32:53.860 --> 32:59.860
But if you expand the size to a lot, then it starts to seem like you're an enthusiast

32:59.860 --> 33:01.380
and you just want to offer variety.

33:01.380 --> 33:02.660
Let me throw this out.

33:02.660 --> 33:05.460
500 spots, all sold out except one.

33:06.900 --> 33:08.260
I had a big night last night.

33:08.260 --> 33:09.460
I don't want to talk about it.

33:11.140 --> 33:15.140
I tried to make my house liken up, but it didn't work.

33:15.140 --> 33:24.980
I imagine in that movie,

33:24.980 --> 33:29.380
the old man is just floating by other people's houses with his condom balloons,

33:29.380 --> 33:32.260
just like looking in the windows and like flirting.

33:32.260 --> 33:46.100
And that movie is called You Up.

33:50.100 --> 33:53.860
Someone on Twitter is going to steal that joke and get a million followers.

33:55.140 --> 33:57.300
I don't think that would fit in the tweet, mon frere.

33:57.300 --> 33:59.140
That's a long way around to get to that one.

33:59.140 --> 34:02.740
So now imagine there's a hallway lined with vending machines, right?

34:03.300 --> 34:08.260
So giant vending machine, full of condoms, price for each item, one massage, but

34:11.380 --> 34:12.100
received.

34:14.100 --> 34:15.380
You let me give you a massage.

34:15.380 --> 34:16.180
I give you a condom.

34:16.180 --> 34:16.980
This is bad.

34:16.980 --> 34:18.020
This is actually gone.

34:18.740 --> 34:20.020
Don't do this one.

34:20.020 --> 34:21.620
This one is not a good one.

34:21.620 --> 34:22.500
You know what I'm saying?

34:22.500 --> 34:23.220
And I'm hearing it.

34:23.220 --> 34:24.100
I'm hearing it.

34:24.100 --> 34:25.140
Yeah, absolutely.

34:25.140 --> 34:26.100
It's bad.

34:26.100 --> 34:27.300
Absolutely.

34:27.300 --> 34:28.260
This one's not good.

34:28.260 --> 34:29.060
Don't do that one.

34:29.060 --> 34:37.300
But you do you watch your guests walk through this hallway, judging their choices

34:38.180 --> 34:38.820
as they walk?

34:38.820 --> 34:41.300
Because I imagine a hallway full of vending machines.

34:41.300 --> 34:46.900
I'm imagining some like the shining but with product placement sort of action going on.

34:46.900 --> 34:47.300
Right.

34:47.300 --> 34:50.900
And so they walk past the, you know, the sprite machine.

34:50.900 --> 34:54.100
They walk past the one with the lifesavers and pop tarts.

34:54.100 --> 34:57.140
They walk past one that has like your mixtape in it.

34:57.140 --> 35:00.100
And you're like, oh, you're going to stuff with the mixtape one?

35:00.820 --> 35:01.460
I made that.

35:01.460 --> 35:03.380
These are some hand-drawn zines.

35:03.380 --> 35:05.060
No, I'm going to keep on going.

35:05.060 --> 35:06.500
You're not going to buy my zines.

35:06.500 --> 35:06.820
Okay.

35:07.780 --> 35:10.260
Can you do a question for me, Justin?

35:10.260 --> 35:11.140
I love that, Griffin.

35:11.140 --> 35:12.260
Thank you so much for asking.

35:12.260 --> 35:13.140
That's so sweet of you.

35:14.580 --> 35:18.100
I'm 24 and I want to get into eating cheese.

35:18.100 --> 35:20.580
It felt like he was going to interrupt us, which is why I...

35:21.140 --> 35:21.860
No.

35:21.860 --> 35:25.460
It felt like he was going to interrupt himself, but I was really excited to watch it happen.

35:25.460 --> 35:25.940
Yeah.

35:25.940 --> 35:30.660
So I'm 24 and I want to get into eating cheese so that I don't feel like a social pariah at

35:30.660 --> 35:31.700
fancy dinner parties.

35:33.620 --> 35:35.140
Did you just lean over to fart?

35:35.780 --> 35:36.820
No, he was scared you were going to interrupt yourself.

35:36.820 --> 35:39.220
I'm afraid you're going to like yell at me.

35:39.220 --> 35:42.900
So I don't feel like a social pariah at fancy dinner parties.

35:42.900 --> 35:44.660
I'm not lactose intolerant.

35:44.660 --> 35:46.740
I just don't like how it tastes.

35:46.740 --> 35:46.980
Yes.

35:48.020 --> 35:50.660
I do love pizza, though, because pizza is the perfect food.

35:50.660 --> 35:52.260
Second, only the sandwiches.

35:52.260 --> 35:53.700
That's incorrect, but whatever.

35:53.700 --> 35:57.060
I assume that, at least for me, it will be an acquired taste.

35:57.540 --> 36:00.340
What would be a good type of cheese to start with?

36:00.340 --> 36:01.940
And that's from Cheeseless in the district.

36:01.940 --> 36:05.940
Now, brothers, I am going to have to defer to you on this question.

36:05.940 --> 36:11.140
I'm assuming the first dozen pieces of raw cheese you put in your mouths were foul and

36:11.140 --> 36:13.220
profane as they would...

36:13.220 --> 36:15.780
Please explain the terminology you've just used.

36:16.500 --> 36:16.980
Raw cheese.

36:16.980 --> 36:18.020
We've talked about it before.

36:18.020 --> 36:20.100
I don't fuck with raw cheese.

36:20.100 --> 36:23.140
I only like melted cheese, like on pizza or burgers.

36:23.140 --> 36:25.460
I just don't fuck with raw cheese.

36:25.460 --> 36:26.420
It's so good.

36:26.420 --> 36:26.980
It's not that weird.

36:26.980 --> 36:28.900
Raw cheese is milk.

36:28.900 --> 36:30.260
I just don't fuck with raw cheese.

36:32.820 --> 36:34.420
So you guys will have to talk about how...

36:36.420 --> 36:38.900
Don't do this to me right now, okay?

36:38.900 --> 36:39.780
Trying to do a comedy show.

36:39.780 --> 36:41.700
I don't want to talk about raw cheese and how...

36:41.700 --> 36:44.580
Cheese has been cooked, kind of.

36:44.580 --> 36:45.060
My wife...

36:45.620 --> 36:48.100
It's been stirred enough, I think.

36:48.100 --> 36:51.460
We've been trying to get the kids to broaden their palates, and Sidney said,

36:51.460 --> 36:56.020
you know, you set a really bad example because you rule out whole categories of foods that

36:56.020 --> 36:57.300
you won't even try.

36:57.300 --> 36:58.340
I said, name one.

36:58.340 --> 36:59.380
She said, raw cheese.

36:59.380 --> 37:00.100
I said, name two.

37:00.100 --> 37:01.300
That was a gimme.

37:01.300 --> 37:03.860
And she said, creamy dips.

37:05.220 --> 37:07.140
And it's fair.

37:07.140 --> 37:08.500
I won't eat creamy dips.

37:08.500 --> 37:11.220
And she said, you can't just say you won't eat creamy dips.

37:11.220 --> 37:12.420
You're 38 years old.

37:13.940 --> 37:16.020
I said, let me turn that around on you.

37:16.020 --> 37:17.380
I'm 38 years old.

37:17.380 --> 37:20.020
I can say that I don't like creamy dips.

37:20.020 --> 37:21.380
I'm just not going to do that.

37:22.180 --> 37:25.220
French onion, the soup's great, the dip's whack.

37:25.780 --> 37:27.940
Creamy ranch, ranch, foul.

37:27.940 --> 37:30.100
That's the one that boggles my mind.

37:30.100 --> 37:32.660
Ranch, the second...

37:32.660 --> 37:36.260
I would say it goes like ketchup and mustard tied ranch.

37:36.260 --> 37:38.900
It's like right there of most go-to...

37:38.900 --> 37:40.020
Don't fuck with it.

37:40.020 --> 37:43.220
Don't fuck with ranch, don't fuck with creamy dips, don't fuck with raw cheese.

37:43.220 --> 37:44.740
So, brothers, how did you start?

37:44.740 --> 37:49.140
How did you power through your first 100 nasty bites of raw cheese?

37:49.140 --> 37:52.260
Raw cheese to trick yourself into thinking it was good.

37:52.260 --> 37:54.180
I'll get to how to enjoy it in a second.

37:54.180 --> 38:00.580
If you want to sound continental, more than any other like food there is,

38:01.220 --> 38:06.100
cheese is the easiest thing to bullshit about and sound intelligence

38:06.100 --> 38:12.260
to the point where you can even comment on the consistency of it

38:12.260 --> 38:14.820
and sound smart and go, oh, that's a soft cheese.

38:16.500 --> 38:18.340
A thing anyone could tell.

38:18.340 --> 38:22.180
I mean, like, oh, yes, oh, that's kind of a hard cheese.

38:22.180 --> 38:26.020
I kind of destroyed that with my teeth into a different state

38:26.020 --> 38:27.940
that was easier to swallow, so...

38:29.140 --> 38:31.540
I have a few ketchels that I use for wine

38:31.540 --> 38:32.660
that you could probably steal for cheese.

38:32.660 --> 38:33.220
Okay.

38:33.220 --> 38:34.100
Let me give you one.

38:36.660 --> 38:37.780
Oh, assertive.

38:37.780 --> 38:38.280
Oh!

38:42.580 --> 38:44.980
And then you back it up again, like take another sip

38:44.980 --> 38:47.060
and buy yourself a little bit more time.

38:47.060 --> 38:48.420
That's assertive fruit.

38:48.420 --> 38:50.020
That's an assertive fruit on there.

38:50.020 --> 38:52.980
Oh, is that pepper?

38:52.980 --> 38:53.620
Oh!

38:53.620 --> 38:54.580
I love it to that.

38:54.580 --> 38:54.980
That's good.

38:54.980 --> 38:55.700
Can I try one?

38:55.700 --> 38:56.180
Yeah.

38:56.180 --> 38:58.820
Take a bite of the cheese and go, oh, that's very cheese forward.

39:00.580 --> 39:03.460
That sounds like you're doing a sketch.

39:03.460 --> 39:04.420
I wouldn't do that.

39:04.900 --> 39:06.340
You could also take a bite.

39:06.340 --> 39:07.540
Here's the secret.

39:07.540 --> 39:09.940
Unlike wine, actually exactly like wine,

39:09.940 --> 39:12.740
nobody has any fucking idea what they're talking about.

39:12.740 --> 39:18.180
So, if you pick up any cheese and bite it and go,

39:18.180 --> 39:22.180
oh, that's gone bad, nobody can disprove it.

39:22.180 --> 39:24.980
Start it with, actually, that's bad.

39:25.860 --> 39:27.060
Oh, don't eat this one, guys.

39:27.940 --> 39:29.060
This one's bad.

39:29.060 --> 39:30.020
Don't eat this one, Mary.

39:30.020 --> 39:33.300
That would go well with crackers is another like,

39:33.300 --> 39:35.780
95% of the time, you're cool with that.

39:35.780 --> 39:37.860
I like how you guys have glommed onto the easy part

39:37.860 --> 39:39.460
of this question, which is faking expertise,

39:39.460 --> 39:40.980
which anyone could do at any time.

39:40.980 --> 39:45.300
And not focus on the hard part, which is how to eat fucking rowdy cheese.

39:45.300 --> 39:46.260
What am I supposed to do?

39:46.260 --> 39:47.220
I'm not going to teach them.

39:47.220 --> 39:48.100
I'll tell you how to do it.

39:48.100 --> 39:50.500
Yeah, I'm not going to do close-up magic for you up here

39:50.500 --> 39:51.620
to show you how to pocket it.

39:51.620 --> 39:52.900
I want you to take a bite of the cheese.

39:52.900 --> 39:54.580
This is what I do when I go to the dentist.

39:54.580 --> 39:56.420
Take a bite of the cheese, and then just start counting.

39:56.420 --> 39:58.180
What the fuck's up with your dentist, my bud?

39:59.140 --> 40:00.660
No, no, no, let me get to it.

40:01.220 --> 40:02.100
Take a bite of the cheese.

40:02.100 --> 40:04.740
Your teeth are fucked up, and we're going to have to get in there

40:04.740 --> 40:07.460
like Rambo and save your mouth.

40:07.460 --> 40:11.540
But first, I melted some Brie on some apples.

40:14.580 --> 40:16.420
That wasn't the part I was getting.

40:16.420 --> 40:17.540
That would be nice.

40:17.540 --> 40:18.100
I wouldn't.

40:18.100 --> 40:21.060
Now that you're saying that, that would be pretty cool.

40:21.060 --> 40:22.420
I mean, if they melt it, sure.

40:24.420 --> 40:24.980
That's fine, too.

40:24.980 --> 40:25.780
We're all in agreement.

40:25.780 --> 40:28.820
Take a bite of the cheese, and then start counting ceiling tiles.

40:28.820 --> 40:30.900
That's what I was going to say.

40:30.900 --> 40:31.860
Oh, that was it?

40:31.860 --> 40:32.340
Yes.

40:32.340 --> 40:33.060
Wow.

40:33.060 --> 40:34.580
That's what I do at the dentist.

40:34.580 --> 40:35.860
It wasn't a good bit.

40:35.860 --> 40:39.300
But I was hoping I'd give you time to think of something funny to say.

40:41.300 --> 40:43.140
Now, we've pulled back the curtain too far.

40:43.140 --> 40:43.620
Oh, shit.

40:43.620 --> 40:44.660
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

40:44.660 --> 40:46.660
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

40:49.860 --> 40:51.220
Something in the monitor.

40:51.220 --> 40:52.340
I had something in the monitor.

40:52.340 --> 40:53.060
Probably it's in the monitor.

40:53.060 --> 40:54.020
Dun-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

40:56.020 --> 40:56.980
That's not going to cut it.

40:57.860 --> 40:58.900
Not for DC.

40:58.900 --> 40:59.860
Speed back or something.

40:59.860 --> 41:00.500
Yeah, pump it up.

41:00.500 --> 41:01.220
Here we go.

41:01.220 --> 41:02.740
Dun-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

41:02.740 --> 41:04.260
I want a munch.

41:04.260 --> 41:07.940
I want a munch, squad.

41:07.940 --> 41:15.780
I want to munch, squad.

41:15.780 --> 41:16.980
Welcome to Munch Squad.

41:16.980 --> 41:21.380
It's a podcast within a podcast.

41:23.060 --> 41:25.300
Thank you to Jade for that theme song.

41:25.300 --> 41:30.340
This is a podcast of the podcast highlighting the latest and greatest in brand eating

41:30.340 --> 41:34.340
and quick service restaurant innovation.

41:34.340 --> 41:35.940
Fun-ovation, if you will.

41:35.940 --> 41:36.740
I will.

41:36.740 --> 41:38.900
I have fucking huge news.

41:42.900 --> 41:51.300
Does everybody feel kind of bummed out by how static the level of craveable innovation has been?

41:54.260 --> 41:54.900
Fear not.

41:56.740 --> 42:00.020
If you listen to this show and the answer to that is yes,

42:00.020 --> 42:01.060
you're a madman.

42:03.700 --> 42:06.660
Taco Bell has taken craveable innovation to the next level.

42:06.660 --> 42:08.100
I didn't want it to be them.

42:08.100 --> 42:09.300
It was, though.

42:09.300 --> 42:10.500
Who else would it be?

42:11.060 --> 42:16.340
They're delisting the fucking cooler ranch Locos Doritos taco.

42:16.340 --> 42:18.580
They can fuck off if they're replacing it with-

42:18.580 --> 42:19.780
No, no, no, listen.

42:19.780 --> 42:23.140
Unless it's two Locos Doritos cooler ranch tacos.

42:24.260 --> 42:26.020
Here's the subhead for this.

42:26.660 --> 42:29.780
The company gives fans carefree indulgence.

42:29.780 --> 42:31.940
In this elevated chalupa experience.

42:31.940 --> 42:33.060
Come my friends.

42:33.940 --> 42:38.340
This is a very accurate subhead because if you eat the toasted cheddar chalupa

42:38.340 --> 42:40.180
and someone's like, what are you doing?

42:40.180 --> 42:42.340
Your proper response is, I don't fucking care.

42:42.340 --> 42:42.840
Yes.

42:44.500 --> 42:46.020
I'm literally carefree.

42:46.900 --> 42:49.460
Not about my body, not about my spirit.

42:49.460 --> 42:52.340
I've never thought about carefree in those terms before.

42:52.900 --> 42:55.540
I used to care and now I've given up.

42:55.540 --> 42:56.980
Yeah, I'm free of caring.

42:56.980 --> 43:01.540
That is also the most hedonistic subhead I've ever heard a company put its name.

43:01.540 --> 43:03.540
Indulge in our pleasure.

43:03.540 --> 43:06.740
Eat the cheese and the beef we have supplied.

43:06.740 --> 43:08.420
Live in the moment.

43:08.420 --> 43:11.700
You guys are having a lot of fun with the fucking subhead of this press release.

43:12.660 --> 43:18.980
The beloved Taco Bell chalupa that fans know and love is getting a next level cheesy glow up.

43:20.500 --> 43:23.700
Introducing the toasted cheddar chalupa.

43:23.700 --> 43:29.860
Confirmed for nationwide release September 12th.

43:29.860 --> 43:31.060
Holy shit.

43:31.060 --> 43:31.700
Come on.

43:31.700 --> 43:33.300
We checked with our scientists.

43:33.300 --> 43:34.820
We just checked with ourselves.

43:34.820 --> 43:36.420
We are definitely doing this, folks.

43:37.380 --> 43:37.860
I like that.

43:37.860 --> 43:38.740
That sounds like a threat.

43:38.740 --> 43:39.940
You can't reason with us.

43:39.940 --> 43:40.900
We've confirmed it.

43:41.460 --> 43:44.020
We're way past the point of no return on this one.

43:44.020 --> 43:45.780
Historically, also they tested in one market.

43:45.780 --> 43:51.700
So it's like, well, we killed Buffalo, but at least we didn't get the rest of the country.

43:51.700 --> 43:56.500
The toasted cheddar chalupa presents brilliantly simplistic shell innovation

43:57.140 --> 44:01.780
by baking real aged cheddar cheese onto the shell.

44:02.340 --> 44:05.060
Since the classic chalupa was first introduced in 1999,

44:05.060 --> 44:08.420
Taco Bell has consistently found new ways to create all new chalupa experiences.

44:08.420 --> 44:08.900
Thank God.

44:09.460 --> 44:12.740
Whether it's flavor innovation like the Baja chalupa in 2000,

44:12.740 --> 44:16.100
size innovation with the 2017 launch of the double chalupa.

44:16.820 --> 44:19.620
Is that an innovation, Taco Bell?

44:19.620 --> 44:23.940
That is just, that is just addition.

44:23.940 --> 44:26.900
Or protein innovation with the naked chicken chalupa.

44:28.740 --> 44:34.100
That is, that is not a protein innovation.

44:34.100 --> 44:37.940
It's a fucking whack chicken breast they folded into a taco.

44:37.940 --> 44:38.820
No, I get that.

44:38.820 --> 44:41.380
But that's not like we've invented a new protein.

44:41.380 --> 44:44.420
Yeah, we found some new protein fossilized in amber.

44:44.420 --> 44:46.100
Naked chicken chalupa that same year.

44:46.660 --> 44:49.060
The chalupa experience has no boundaries.

44:49.060 --> 44:49.940
And that is a threat.

44:50.580 --> 44:51.620
That is a threat.

44:51.620 --> 44:53.220
We are not stopping here, folks.

44:53.220 --> 44:56.180
We are nowhere near the fucking Rubicon.

44:56.180 --> 44:59.060
At Taco Bell, here's a quote from Liz Matthews,

44:59.060 --> 45:01.300
chief food innovation officer at Taco Bell Corp.

45:01.300 --> 45:03.940
At Taco Bell, we get excited by the what ifs.

45:05.620 --> 45:06.820
It gets us rock hard.

45:06.820 --> 45:07.780
It gets us rock hard.

45:08.580 --> 45:12.980
But the what ifs we can dream up and bring to life for our fans.

45:12.980 --> 45:15.860
And it is a living, sentient being.

45:15.860 --> 45:20.020
And the toasted cheddar chalupa is an example of just that.

45:20.740 --> 45:22.580
We know cheese makes everything better.

45:24.180 --> 45:25.060
Within limits.

45:25.060 --> 45:29.060
And baking aged cheddar into the shell of an already iconic product

45:29.060 --> 45:32.100
is a game changer for our fans.

45:32.100 --> 45:32.980
Our fans will love.

45:32.980 --> 45:36.820
I don't know what the game is, but I feel we've all lost already.

45:37.380 --> 45:41.620
To be fair, baking cheese onto most games is a game changer.

45:41.620 --> 45:42.420
Sure.

45:42.420 --> 45:44.180
That's a lot harder to play chess, huh?

45:44.180 --> 45:47.780
Hey, I think your copy of Operation is fucked.

45:49.380 --> 45:50.580
If there's one-

45:50.580 --> 45:51.860
This thing's 10 paragraphs long.

45:51.860 --> 45:52.580
Oh, God!

45:52.580 --> 45:53.620
We gotta haul ass.

45:53.620 --> 45:56.180
If there's one sure sign of the latest foodie craze,

45:56.180 --> 45:58.180
it's a line stretching around the block.

45:58.180 --> 45:58.980
That's why Taco-

45:59.940 --> 46:03.060
That has nothing to do with fucking anything, Taco Bell!

46:03.620 --> 46:06.660
Yeah, it would mean something if people were lining up.

46:06.660 --> 46:07.300
Anyways.

46:09.060 --> 46:10.020
Okay, listen, though.

46:11.220 --> 46:13.620
If there's one sure sign of the line stretching around the block,

46:13.620 --> 46:18.020
that's why Taco Bell is giving a few fans the chance to try Taco Bell's latest

46:18.020 --> 46:21.940
craveable innovation before it's even available nationwide.

46:21.940 --> 46:25.380
But because the foodiest hotspots are all the best kept secrets,

46:26.020 --> 46:31.140
fans will have to uncover where the advanced tastings of toasted cheddar

46:31.780 --> 46:33.300
are being served for themselves.

46:34.420 --> 46:35.140
Are they doing-

46:35.140 --> 46:36.980
They're gonna have to hire Nicolas Cage.

46:36.980 --> 46:45.700
The most wild thing about this paragraph,

46:46.260 --> 46:48.180
and I'm sure there's more wild things about the other paragraphs,

46:48.180 --> 46:49.300
but this paragraph specifically,

46:49.860 --> 46:53.300
is that they are basically saying, like,

46:53.300 --> 46:55.060
wouldn't it be weird if we were, like, real food?

46:56.820 --> 46:58.500
It's basically, like, food face.

46:58.500 --> 47:00.340
Like, they're pretending to be food.

47:00.340 --> 47:04.420
It's a perversion of what we understand food to be like.

47:04.420 --> 47:06.820
What if Taco Bell was, like, food?

47:06.820 --> 47:08.420
That you'd buy at a restaurant?

47:08.420 --> 47:09.300
Wouldn't that be wild?

47:09.300 --> 47:13.300
Also, the weird kayfabe of putting out a press release and saying,

47:13.300 --> 47:14.820
but we're not gonna tell you,

47:14.820 --> 47:18.020
as though they haven't published, like, a dissertation.

47:18.020 --> 47:19.460
They haven't published locations, though.

47:19.460 --> 47:19.940
That's what's secret.

47:19.940 --> 47:24.660
Is this the start of a fucking Taco Bell ARG Justin McElroy?

47:25.620 --> 47:27.380
Not, not, uh...

47:27.380 --> 47:27.700
Is this-

47:27.700 --> 47:29.540
You mean an alternate reality gordita?

47:29.540 --> 47:30.340
No, it is not.

47:31.460 --> 47:32.740
Is it I love cheese?

47:33.380 --> 47:36.340
And see, there is an ARG called I love bees that promoted a halo-

47:36.340 --> 47:37.460
Okay, six of you like that.

47:39.060 --> 47:41.700
The toasted cheddar chalupa is not just one of this year's

47:41.700 --> 47:43.540
biggest innovations from Taco Bell,

47:43.540 --> 47:46.820
it's also the largest international release of a menu item from Taco Bell

47:46.820 --> 47:48.980
since the naked chicken chalupa in 2017.

47:48.980 --> 47:50.740
Starting this month and for a limited time,

47:50.740 --> 47:54.980
the menu item will also be available in Aruba, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica,

47:54.980 --> 47:58.580
Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama, and Puerto Rico.

47:58.580 --> 48:00.820
After all, the love of cheese is definitely universal.

48:01.700 --> 48:05.780
Like the classic chalupa, the toasted cheddar chalupa is filled with the option

48:05.780 --> 48:08.980
of seasoned beef, chicken, or steak, and then piled with shredded lettuce.

48:08.980 --> 48:10.420
These are just the ingredients.

48:10.420 --> 48:14.100
What takes the chalupa to foodie-worthy status is all on the outside of the shell.

48:14.100 --> 48:15.460
It's the fucking cheese you melted.

48:15.460 --> 48:18.660
Like yeah, why do these press releases have to tell you six times and then

48:18.660 --> 48:20.020
we melted the cheese?

48:20.020 --> 48:22.740
We put cheese on it and made it real hot.

48:22.740 --> 48:26.980
Taco Bell has taken six month aged sharp cheddar cheese.

48:26.980 --> 48:27.540
Old cheese.

48:29.060 --> 48:29.860
There were six-

48:31.060 --> 48:32.580
I'm glad cheese ain't sentient.

48:32.580 --> 48:37.060
Because that means there'll be six months where the cheese is like,

48:37.060 --> 48:39.380
they must be saving me up for something good.

48:41.380 --> 48:42.100
What is it?

48:42.100 --> 48:42.580
What is it?

48:42.580 --> 48:44.500
William H. Macy's birthday?

48:44.500 --> 48:47.460
Yeah, I'm headed for big things, suckers.

48:48.180 --> 48:49.700
Audios, I'm going to be-

48:49.700 --> 48:50.180
Oh, what?

48:52.820 --> 48:54.100
Outside of a chalupa.

48:54.100 --> 48:54.500
What's up?

48:54.500 --> 48:54.980
What's up?

48:54.980 --> 48:55.780
It's nice to be here.

48:55.780 --> 49:00.100
So you're your new dirty ground beef.

49:00.100 --> 49:00.600
Uh-oh.

49:00.600 --> 49:05.160
Oh, it's toasted on the iconic chalupa shell

49:05.160 --> 49:07.720
to create a crispy blanket of flavor and texture,

49:08.360 --> 49:11.400
unlocking a whole new cheese experience.

49:13.080 --> 49:14.760
That's this week's Munch Squad.

49:14.760 --> 49:15.720
Thank you for indulging me.

49:15.720 --> 49:30.440
Thank you, Munch Squad.

49:30.440 --> 49:31.400
Oh, hello there.

49:31.400 --> 49:35.640
This is Griffin McElroy, the littlest one of the three of them.

49:35.640 --> 49:39.160
And yeah, thanks for listening to this live episode from,

49:39.160 --> 49:42.440
gosh, last September that we did in Washington, DC.

49:42.440 --> 49:43.800
I tried to give you all a heads up,

49:43.800 --> 49:47.800
but Travis and Teresa have just welcomed a new human being

49:47.800 --> 49:48.760
into the planet Earth.

49:48.760 --> 49:50.920
And so things are going to be a little bit up in the air

49:50.920 --> 49:52.440
for a while.

49:53.240 --> 49:55.560
So yeah, get a live one this week, next week,

49:55.560 --> 49:57.640
maybe another live one, maybe a Bro's Better, Bro's Best.

49:57.640 --> 49:58.200
I don't know.

49:58.200 --> 49:58.520
I don't know.

49:58.520 --> 49:59.640
We're figuring it out as we go,

49:59.640 --> 50:01.880
building the plane under our butts as we fly it.

50:02.600 --> 50:04.440
But thank you all so much for sticking with us.

50:04.440 --> 50:08.120
And of course, congratulations to Travis and Teresa.

50:08.120 --> 50:09.960
We're all super, super happy for them.

50:09.960 --> 50:12.520
And we're also super happy that stamps.com has decided

50:12.520 --> 50:15.480
to sponsor us this episode, equally happy, I would say,

50:16.360 --> 50:19.320
because New Year's resolutions, they are difficult to keep.

50:19.320 --> 50:20.360
I'm always saying that.

50:21.000 --> 50:24.840
But here's an easy one that you can do, a resolution, I mean.

50:24.840 --> 50:26.920
You can stop wasting time going to the post office

50:26.920 --> 50:28.840
and use stamps.com instead.

50:28.840 --> 50:31.800
It's super slick, super easy, streamlined,

50:31.800 --> 50:33.400
efficiency business.

50:33.400 --> 50:36.120
It brings all the services of the US Postal Service

50:36.120 --> 50:37.240
right to your computer.

50:37.240 --> 50:38.520

50:38.520 --> 50:40.760
official US Postage 24-7.

50:40.760 --> 50:41.960
And then once your mail is ready,

50:41.960 --> 50:43.480
you just hand it to your mail carrier

50:43.480 --> 50:45.160
or you drop it in your freaking mailbox.

50:45.160 --> 50:46.040
Don't worry about it.

50:46.040 --> 50:47.880
Also, with stamps.com, you get five cents off

50:47.880 --> 50:51.640

51:14.840 --> 51:16.520
Never go to the post office again.

51:16.520 --> 51:17.480
Hey, me undies.

51:17.480 --> 51:20.520
Me undies is also here and they're here for you

51:20.520 --> 51:24.680
and they're also here for your dog or your cat or whatever.

51:24.680 --> 51:27.720
Because hey, they have these new pants things

51:27.720 --> 51:29.480
that are called buddy pants

51:29.480 --> 51:33.720
and they allow you to match whatever you're wearing

51:33.720 --> 51:36.120
to whatever your pet is wearing.

51:36.120 --> 51:40.280
They've got not one, not two, not nine,

51:40.280 --> 51:42.360
but three new Valentine's Day prints

51:43.160 --> 51:45.800
that you can match with your buddy this year.

51:45.800 --> 51:48.440
If you're matching with your BFF, a loved one, whatever,

51:48.440 --> 51:51.720
or your dog, it still counts with me undies.

51:51.720 --> 51:53.560
They also have new loungewear you can wear out and about,

51:53.560 --> 51:55.960
keep your eyes peeled for some cozy new additions.

51:55.960 --> 51:57.480
They got a great offer for our listeners.

52:08.680 --> 52:11.000

52:12.280 --> 52:14.920
Hey, we have a live show coming up in Cincinnati.

52:14.920 --> 52:16.680
You can go to mcroy.family,

52:16.680 --> 52:18.680
see if there's still tickets available for that one,

52:18.680 --> 52:20.120
doing Taz and Mabim Bam,

52:20.120 --> 52:22.040
and we're figuring out what we're gonna be doing

52:22.040 --> 52:23.320
for touring for the rest of the year.

52:23.880 --> 52:25.480
Got the JoCo Cruise coming up in March,

52:25.480 --> 52:26.920
but we're looking into the future

52:26.920 --> 52:30.040
for the Fill Your Life with Laughter and Love Tour 2020.

52:30.040 --> 52:31.800
Looking forward to that.

52:32.360 --> 52:35.000
I believe pre-orders are still open for the Taz board game.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.760
You can go to theadventurezonegame.com.

52:36.760 --> 52:38.760
We've been working on some new content for that

52:38.760 --> 52:40.840
that we're all really excited about.

52:40.840 --> 52:44.200
And Graphic Novel 3 of the Adventure Zone Graphic Novel series

52:44.200 --> 52:45.480
is also available to pre-order.

52:45.480 --> 52:46.760
That one's coming out this summer.

52:46.760 --> 52:48.600
You can go to theadventurezonecomic.com

52:48.600 --> 52:49.720
and check that all out.

52:50.280 --> 52:52.200
I think that that's probably gonna do it.

52:52.200 --> 52:53.560
Again, we'll be back next Monday,

52:53.560 --> 52:55.880
probably with another sort of special episode

52:55.880 --> 52:58.840
to fill the gap while Travis and Teresa are away

52:58.840 --> 53:01.240
enjoying the new human being that they've created.

53:01.800 --> 53:04.200
So yeah, we'll be back next week with something

53:04.200 --> 53:05.560
and we'll talk to you then.

53:05.560 --> 53:07.560
Bye.

53:07.560 --> 53:10.680
Hey gang, Jesse here, the founder of Maximum Fun.

53:10.680 --> 53:14.200
And with me is Stacey Molesky, who is, among other things,

53:14.200 --> 53:16.440
the lady who responds to all of your tweets.

53:16.440 --> 53:19.320
Hi everyone, I also send you newsletters.

53:19.320 --> 53:21.240
So anyway, something really awesome.

53:21.880 --> 53:24.520
You, MaxFun listeners, have given us the chance

53:24.520 --> 53:28.440
to do something really cool on behalf of our entire community

53:28.440 --> 53:30.040
and we wanted to tell you about it.

53:30.040 --> 53:31.960
Last summer, following the MaxFun Drive,

53:31.960 --> 53:35.240
we put all of the enamel pins on sale to $10 and up members.

53:35.240 --> 53:38.920
With proceeds going to the National CASA GAL Association for Children.

53:38.920 --> 53:43.480
Your generous support and enthusiasm raised over $100,000.

53:45.720 --> 53:47.800
Our bookkeeper, Steph, would be quick to tell me

53:47.800 --> 53:53.800
the exact total is $109,025, to be exact.

53:53.800 --> 53:57.400
Your money will go toward parent kids who've experienced abuse or neglect

53:57.400 --> 54:01.000
with court-appointed advocates or guardian ad litem volunteers.

54:01.000 --> 54:05.080
In other words, kids in tough spots will have somebody in their corner.

54:05.080 --> 54:08.360
Knowledgeable grown-ups who are on their team through court dates

54:08.360 --> 54:11.880
and life upheavals and confusing situations, whatever.

54:11.880 --> 54:15.240
The money we raise together is going to help a lot of kids.

54:15.240 --> 54:16.760
Whether you bought pins or not,

54:16.760 --> 54:21.640
you can help us build on that $109,000 foundation.

54:22.280 --> 54:25.800
Make a donation to support National CASA GAL

54:25.800 --> 54:28.840
and help some of our nation's most vulnerable children

54:28.840 --> 54:33.720
at maximumfun.org slash CASA.

54:33.720 --> 54:36.760
That's maximumfun.org slash CASA.

54:36.760 --> 54:38.440
And seriously, thank you.

54:38.440 --> 54:39.480
Our community rules.

54:46.600 --> 54:47.720
There was a question.

54:47.720 --> 54:50.440
There's a question that was sent to us that we're not going to get to.

54:50.440 --> 54:52.920
A lot of people send us jokey jokes and that's fine and everything,

54:52.920 --> 54:55.480
but it doesn't give us a long runway to go off of.

54:55.480 --> 54:58.040
But somebody sent one and that was really, really funny.

54:59.800 --> 55:01.320
So we're not going to do this question,

55:01.320 --> 55:03.880
but I wanted to read it out loud because it cracked us the fuck up.

55:04.760 --> 55:08.040
Jesse in section N, row J, seat one asked...

55:09.720 --> 55:10.280
Crushed it.

55:11.000 --> 55:14.200
Asked, I keep accidentally tricking people into thinking

55:14.200 --> 55:17.640
I know shit about astrology by saying yikes to their sign.

55:20.200 --> 55:22.760
That is a solid ass bit.

55:22.760 --> 55:23.560
A good bit.

55:24.120 --> 55:25.320
It's a quality bit.

55:25.320 --> 55:26.440
Oh, I'm a Gemini.

55:27.400 --> 55:27.800
Yikes.

55:27.800 --> 55:29.000
People are going to steal that.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.760
It's going to be all over DC soon.

55:30.760 --> 55:31.320
Yikes.

55:31.320 --> 55:31.880
All right.

55:31.880 --> 55:32.440
Yikes.

55:32.440 --> 55:33.160
Oh, you're...

55:33.160 --> 55:34.840
Ooh, Taurus.

55:35.720 --> 55:36.120
Yikes.

55:36.120 --> 55:39.240
Let's begin.

55:39.240 --> 55:39.560
Hello.

55:40.120 --> 55:42.120
Everybody seems to have congregated on the stage.

55:42.120 --> 55:42.600
Right, microphone?

55:42.600 --> 55:43.560
That's totally fine.

55:43.560 --> 55:44.040
Let's begin.

55:44.040 --> 55:44.680
Hi, what's your name?

55:45.960 --> 55:46.360
Hello.

55:46.360 --> 55:47.240
Hi, Autumn.

55:47.240 --> 55:47.640
Autumn.

55:48.920 --> 55:50.040
Hi, how's it going?

55:50.040 --> 55:52.280
Yeah, now this is your part.

55:52.280 --> 55:52.920
Okay, okay.

55:53.480 --> 55:55.400
We don't have a question for you.

55:55.400 --> 55:55.640
Right.

55:56.600 --> 56:00.360
My question was, what should I do with all these teeth?

56:00.360 --> 56:01.960
Yeah, yeah.

56:01.960 --> 56:04.600
So we had some follow ups.

56:04.600 --> 56:05.240
I lied.

56:05.240 --> 56:07.000
We do have questions for you.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.080
Where did you get them?

56:11.080 --> 56:12.840
With, I'm sorry, with teeth?

56:13.640 --> 56:13.880
Okay.

56:14.520 --> 56:17.160
Wait, can I get a bit more Autumn in my monitor, please?

56:17.160 --> 56:18.840
Because it sounded like Autumn said teeth.

56:20.200 --> 56:20.440
Okay.

56:21.480 --> 56:23.720
So I was sitting in my sister's car the other day.

56:23.720 --> 56:24.360
Okay.

56:24.360 --> 56:26.600
Not how I expected this to start.

56:26.600 --> 56:27.880
Please, I'm on pins and needles here.

56:27.880 --> 56:30.520
I opened the glove box and holy shit.

56:33.000 --> 56:36.840
So she had this like purple chest in her cup holder.

56:37.400 --> 56:41.560
And so I looked inside it and it had three human teeth in it.

56:42.520 --> 56:43.320
Okay.

56:43.320 --> 56:45.000
That's way more than I expected you to say.

56:45.000 --> 56:45.240
Okay.

56:47.480 --> 56:50.840
So I turned to my sister who's driving the car and I say,

56:50.840 --> 56:52.440
why do you have a bunch of teeth?

56:52.440 --> 56:53.080
Fair.

56:53.080 --> 56:53.320
Yes.

56:53.320 --> 56:57.880
Yes, she said they belong to her children.

56:57.880 --> 57:02.600
She doesn't want to tell her children that the tooth fairy gave them back to her.

57:03.880 --> 57:04.680
Wait, hold up.

57:04.680 --> 57:06.040
That's what she would say?

57:07.880 --> 57:11.000
She's the worst liar fucking ever.

57:11.720 --> 57:17.560
The tooth fairy said your teeth are busted and super brittle.

57:17.560 --> 57:19.880
And she's also keeping them in a cup holder?

57:19.880 --> 57:20.200
Okay.

57:20.200 --> 57:24.200
Does she not know that garbage cans exist?

57:24.200 --> 57:27.880
She said she didn't feel right throwing part of her kid's body out.

57:28.440 --> 57:29.000
No.

57:29.000 --> 57:29.880
No, that's decent.

57:29.880 --> 57:30.440
That's good.

57:30.440 --> 57:31.000
That's fair.

57:31.720 --> 57:31.960
So.

57:33.240 --> 57:37.400
How does this story end with you receiving the teeth, Autumn?

57:38.680 --> 57:40.040
What did you say?

57:40.040 --> 57:41.560
Well, here's what I said.

57:42.600 --> 57:45.480
We were actually listening to a Mabim Bambit on YouTube.

57:45.480 --> 57:47.000
Don't put this on fucking us.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.800
Don't you dare.

57:50.840 --> 57:51.640
We're good.

57:51.640 --> 57:52.600
We're good people.

57:52.600 --> 57:53.320
We're good people.

57:53.320 --> 57:55.480
You're the one who said, yum, yum, give me some of them teeth.

57:57.000 --> 57:57.720
Autumn.

57:57.720 --> 57:58.120
Autumn.

57:59.160 --> 58:03.800
So then, so I said that I was coming to see you live and that you take advice questions

58:03.800 --> 58:04.680
from the audience.

58:04.680 --> 58:06.200
You didn't fucking bring the teeth.

58:06.200 --> 58:08.520
She said I should ask you what to do with the teeth.

58:08.520 --> 58:10.120
But you didn't bring the teeth.

58:10.120 --> 58:10.680
Well, I didn't.

58:10.680 --> 58:11.640
I don't have them with me.

58:11.640 --> 58:12.040
Thank you.

58:13.560 --> 58:14.280
That's correct.

58:14.280 --> 58:17.960
I was about to edit in the sound of, like, a maraca just to freak everybody's fucking

58:17.960 --> 58:18.520
bean at home.

58:19.560 --> 58:21.480
Hey, Autumn, throw them away.

58:21.480 --> 58:22.760
Put them in the garb, bitch.

58:23.480 --> 58:25.000
She doesn't want to do that.

58:25.000 --> 58:25.640
Why not?

58:27.160 --> 58:28.520
Because they're part of her kid's body.

58:28.520 --> 58:29.080
No, they're not.

58:29.080 --> 58:31.880
So is the pee-poo-tooth of the fucking female.

58:31.880 --> 58:33.640
So is hair you cut off.

58:34.840 --> 58:37.480
You don't keep all the hair, do you, Autumn?

58:37.480 --> 58:38.520
Now, wait a minute.

58:38.520 --> 58:39.000
Hold on.

58:39.960 --> 58:42.280
Autumn, we're coming at you pretty aggro right now.

58:42.280 --> 58:43.800
I want to take a step back.

58:43.800 --> 58:49.320
I will acknowledge, I will cede this to you, that teeth are a more precious part of my

58:49.320 --> 58:53.400
body than hair, my fingernails, my poopy.

58:53.400 --> 58:55.240
My hair is the most special part of my body.

58:55.240 --> 58:55.880
Go on.

58:55.880 --> 59:01.240
If I lose a tooth now, I will have the thought of, well, should I do something with this?

59:01.240 --> 59:02.760
I won't do that with anything else.

59:02.760 --> 59:04.760
So there is something to this question.

59:04.760 --> 59:06.680
You wouldn't do that with any other part of your body.

59:08.680 --> 59:13.400
If you lost another part of your body, you would feel more cool chucking it than all

59:13.400 --> 59:13.900
the tooth.

59:14.680 --> 59:16.040
On the scale of loo-

59:16.040 --> 59:17.880
Anyway, Travis, you know what I'm saying.

59:20.440 --> 59:23.880
Uh, throw them away.

59:25.880 --> 59:27.480
I mean, okay.

59:28.760 --> 59:30.680
I don't think she's going to want them back.

59:32.520 --> 59:33.020
Right?

59:33.640 --> 59:36.360
So I did find a place in Baltimore that buys human teeth.

59:36.360 --> 59:36.760
Oh my god.

59:36.760 --> 59:37.160
Now we're talking about-

59:37.160 --> 59:38.600
No, you cannot!

59:38.600 --> 59:39.720
Don't do it!

59:39.720 --> 59:40.840
Yes, do it.

59:40.840 --> 59:45.320
No, because in three years you'll see some people who look a lot like your nieces and

59:45.320 --> 59:46.440
nephews running around.

59:47.320 --> 59:47.880
So, okay.

59:47.880 --> 59:49.160
What does the place in Baltimore do with them?

59:49.960 --> 59:52.040
Uh, it makes them into jewelry.

59:52.040 --> 59:52.360
Yes.

59:52.360 --> 59:53.080
Yes, makes them into-

59:53.080 --> 59:54.360
Oh, I actually know that rule.

59:54.360 --> 59:54.840
Do that.

59:54.840 --> 59:55.560
Hey, wait.

59:55.560 --> 59:57.080
Get that for your sister.

59:57.080 --> 59:57.640
Hey, wait.

59:58.600 --> 01:00:04.520
So there is an actual tooth fairy, but it's a company in Baltimore.

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:05.880
Is that what you're saying to me?

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:13.320
So, Autumn, if I may, what you have done, and listen, I appreciate this because it gave

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:17.160
us something to talk about, but you said, what should I do with these teeth that I already

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:18.360
figured out something to do with?

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:22.840
Well, I actually only called that place after I submitted the question.

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:23.640
Okay, okay, okay.

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:24.360
Okay, fair enough.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:25.800
But, hey, cool.

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:31.640
Don't fucking sell your nieces and nephews teeth to a fucking strange company in Baltimore!

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:32.760
Throw them in the garbage!

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:36.840
No, but you could pay to have them made into jewelry for your sister.

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:39.400
Oh, thanks for this great necklace, Autumn.

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.280
I love it.

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:41.000
This is great.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.760
It is a step up from a plastic cup in a cup holder.

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:48.360
This is perfect for me, a Klingon blood warrior.

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:52.280
Does that help, Autumn?

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.080
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:53.720
Thank you, Autumn.

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:56.600
Big hand, big hand.

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.200
How about, uh-

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.840
What do you have for sale on nasty eBay?

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.600
Which this show has apparently become.

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:06.200
Katelyn row F, seat one.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:09.560
Head on down for the ad, join the queue.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:09.880
Hello.

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:12.040
Hi, um, okay.

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.400
I'm kind of freaking out right now.

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:14.360
You got this?

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.160
You've got this.

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.120
What's your name?

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:17.000
I'm Tara.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:17.800
Hello, Tara.

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:24.680
So, I am selling my weird cursed Photoshop things on eBay, apparently.

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:25.000
Okay.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.040
So, I'm taking-

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.640
Is this a surprise to you?

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:27.800
No.

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:36.280
No, um, so my grandmother keeps asking me about this new digital art class that I'm

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.400
taking in school.

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:37.640
Right.

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.040
It's a considerate thing for your grandma to do.

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:47.880
But, um, what we do in digital art is our teacher lets us do whatever we want in Photoshop.

01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:48.120
Okay.

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:48.840
And we are about-

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:50.520
That's a bad teacher, y'all.

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:51.880
He, like, gives us-

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.720
Are you paying to go to this school?

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:55.160
You could do that at home.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:59.960
He, like, gives us general guidelines, but for example, you had to combine a bunch of

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:05.000
images in a landscape, and I made a giant crab with laser eyes attacking Ocean City.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:05.160
Okay.

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:05.880
Wait, sick.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:05.960
Sick.

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:10.600
Yeah.

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:16.760
But, um, I'm not sure how I tell my grandmother this is a thing that I submitted in class

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:18.440
and that I get graded on.

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:18.760
Okay.

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:23.800
You don't want your grandmother to see your crab monster art.

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:26.360
What if it turns out your grandmother loves it?

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:31.000
I have to say, that's definitely the pure and true and good and nice answer to this

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:31.800
question.

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:38.840
I must say, when I did read your question in our inbox, I did think, uh, how do I explain

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:42.840
to my grandmother that my digital art projects are not something she wants to see would be

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:45.560
a little bit more, how do I say, um-

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:50.120
Yeah, I was talking with my friend after I submitted it, like, oh, they're gonna think

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.160
about it that way.

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:51.720
Yeah.

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:52.200
Yeah.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.000
Yeah.

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.160
You wrote it, right?

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:58.680
You wrote the question with your, like, your physical body.

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:01.720
You know, have you ever done any nasty digital art?

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:02.760
I'm dying up here.

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:03.720
Give us something.

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:05.000
I'm gonna hit you with something, Tara.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.400
Well, it's not a crab, but, like, sexy.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:08.760
Sexual crab.

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:09.240
You know-

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:12.840
I mean, is merging the faces of Hillary Clinton and Markiplier sexy?

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:13.480
Because I did-

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:15.160
I don't-

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:18.200
I'm not here to yuck any yums.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.600
Tara, I'm gonna hit you with something.

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.240
Not literally.

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:21.880
Not literally.

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:23.800
We get mad-

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:27.080
We get so mad at old people for not knowing about everything.

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:33.480
But maybe it's because we get to a point where we stop showing them all the cool shit.

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:38.840
Maybe if we weren't so afraid to expose our old people to cool shit,

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:40.760
I wouldn't have to explain everything to my dad.

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:46.360
Maybe he would just know about dope shit, and I wouldn't have to try to sit him down

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:49.400
and do a PowerPoint about how Steven Universe works.

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:53.160
Like, maybe I could just fucking let him watch it.

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:55.160
We had a powerful moment last tour.

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:56.760
We were in Atlanta.

01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:00.120
I remember we were backstage, and I broke down in tears

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:01.400
because of the moment I was having with dad

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:03.560
where I did all my Fortnite dances in front of him.

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:06.760
Maybe-

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.840
There is a beautiful possibility here, Tara,

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:12.600
that you show your grandmother this crab attacking a thing,

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.920
and your grandmother goes and steps over to the closet and pulls out,

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:20.760
and she has cut out of magazines the same thing from 1942

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.520
and has made the exact same picture,

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:28.840
and then you finally connect with her on a very deep personal level.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:31.560
Or it'll be like Charlie Chaplin holding a beach ball,

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:32.920
and she'll be like, fucking get it.

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:36.520
Did you see this meme I made?

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.480
Yeah, it's great.

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:39.320
Yeah, you got him.

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:40.520
I'm gonna take a wild-

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:43.480
Tara, how well do you know your grandma and your grandma know you?

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:46.520
Well, we live with each other,

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:47.240
so I know her-

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:48.680
Okay, okay, that's pretty good.

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.440
I'm gonna hit you with something.

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:52.440
Again, this is number two.

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:57.160
Your grandma knows you're not painting sunflowers, Tara.

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:58.040
She knows you.

01:04:58.040 --> 01:04:59.720
She knows you're getting weird.

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:01.400
Just let her see your weird art.

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.240
It'll be less weird than she thinks,

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:06.120
as evidenced by us reading your questions.

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:09.320
Yes, it's so much worse for her not knowing.

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:09.960
Oh, Nana.

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:11.560
Nana.

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:12.680
It's a giant crab.

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:13.560
Oh, thank God.

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:15.720
Oh, thank God it's a giant crab.

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:16.520
Tell me everything.

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:19.160
At least I have some point of reference for that.

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:19.560
Yeah.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:20.200
Does that help?

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:21.320
Yes, thank you.

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:21.880
Good, good, excellent.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:22.200
Thank you.

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:27.160
Hello.

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:27.720
Hello.

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:28.200
Hello.

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:28.920
What's up?

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:29.880
Hi, I'm Kyle.

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:30.440
Hi, Kyle.

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:33.800
So, I was at my office.

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:35.720
I worked at a music school.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.600
Lovely place with a lot of classical music everywhere.

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:39.640
Very professional setting.

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:40.280
Yeah, yeah.

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:40.680
And one day my-

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:41.480
I cracked your code.

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:42.760
I know exactly where you're talking.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:45.960
Dang, one day my boss came in and she said,

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.280
are you guys familiar with Beyblades at all?

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.800
That's a bold way to lead into that.

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:54.280
Go on.

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:57.320
Yeah, well, I said, would you like to see some?

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:02.280
You didn't for a second think this is a trap?

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:03.160
Yeah, that's a trap.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:06.120
I thought maybe a raise was involved,

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:08.120
but I had some Beyblades-

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:09.400
How the heck do you know about Beyblades?

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:10.840
Here's $5,000.

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:12.840
Here's $5,000.

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:15.960
You never know, it's the arts.

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:16.840
But we went-

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:20.200
I had a couple Beyblades and an arena in my trunk.

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:23.340
And-

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:26.360
In case of what?

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:26.860
Yeah.

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:29.800
A challenger.

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:33.720
In case you're being mugged by some tufts

01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:34.520
and you'd be like,

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.840
let's settle this on the Beyblade arena.

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.960
Beyblades, let's rip.

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:42.280
Oh, you did stab me.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.360
Why did I unlock my car trunk for you?

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:47.960
I've made this so much easier.

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:49.720
I'm just going to go ahead and get in here.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:51.480
All you've got is a knife?

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:53.400
Well, brrrrrz.

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:54.600
I've got a blade.

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:55.640
Oh, God, I'm bleeding.

01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:56.600
Oh, no, no, no.

01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:58.120
So what happened next?

01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:59.720
Yeah, so I brought him into the office

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:02.120
and I left him there for a while.

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:04.040
And then one day I came back in

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:06.920
and I realized that the arena was still there,

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:08.280
but the Beyblades were not.

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.640
Oh, no.

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:10.140
Don't.

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:13.720
I mean, it's my fault.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:17.560
But I'm just desperate to try and figure out

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:20.680
how to crack the case of my very professional-

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:23.480
You want us from this stage to tell you

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:27.320
who in your office saw your Beyblade?

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:29.960
Did you submit a list of suspects?

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:31.560
Something?

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:32.120
Do you have any clues?

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:34.120
Did you take any kind of detail to counsel

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:35.400
their comings and goings?

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:37.400
I'm ready to use my little gray cells

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:39.000
to solve this problem for you,

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.680
but I need something to go on.

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:42.840
Can I ask you a very sincere question?

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:43.320
Yeah, go ahead.

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:44.200
I want you to answer.

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:44.700
Sure.

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:46.440
When you brought them in,

01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:48.280
they were in your office.

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:48.760
Yes.

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:52.280
And you decided to leave them in your office.

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:53.160
It's true.

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:53.660
Why?

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:56.840
In case of what?

01:07:58.920 --> 01:07:59.640
Can I try?

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:01.240
Were you lazy and just didn't fucking feel

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:02.200
like carrying it back to the car?

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:03.480
Yeah.

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:04.120
Okay, yeah.

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:06.680
Yeah, that's an answer.

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:09.800
I recognize my kind, air fist bump.

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:12.440
Have you noticed other people in your office

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:14.760
seeming especially, I don't know, relaxed?

01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.840
Enjoying their life for the first time in forever?

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:19.320
Travis thinks that this is the therapeutic effect

01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:20.120
of Beyblades.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.160
Honest to God, I know nothing about them.

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:24.600
Motherfucking fuck!

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:31.320
The closest comparison I have is fidget spinners,

01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:33.080
which I find to be very relaxing.

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:33.800
Trapped.

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:36.440
You've got to put more better Beyblades in there

01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:37.480
and set up a camera.

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:38.840
We set a trap.

01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:40.280
Wait, what?

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:41.640
You already tried a trap?

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:43.880
Lead with that!

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:45.560
Lead with the Beyblade trap!

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:46.600
It got complicated.

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:47.880
No, yes!

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:49.000
That's what I want to hear!

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:52.840
There wasn't going to be an easy solution to this.

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:53.800
Certainly, no.

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:55.320
My Rubik's cube went missing

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:58.040
and a couple other things around the office,

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:01.160
and so we left a candy bar on a desk

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:02.680
precariously placed.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:05.000
I didn't know what we thought would happen next,

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:10.760
but surprise, surprise, it too was gone later.

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:12.440
You were just trying to prove to yourself

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:14.360
that things were in fact being stolen?

01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:19.160
And what, becoming sentient and walking away?

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.000
Like Toy Story style?

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:21.720
You never know.

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:22.200
Okay.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.080
No, hey, you do.

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:25.160
You do know.

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:26.200
On this one, you do know.

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:28.440
That was it?

01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:29.800
That was the end of your investigation?

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:31.160
That was your whole trap?

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:32.440
Well, I know I'm here.

01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:33.720
What kind of trap?

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:35.080
That is an offering!

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:39.640
Yeah, if I figured it out, I wouldn't have asked.

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:40.680
That's a shitty trap.

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:42.680
That's like a hunter going out into the woods

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:45.480
and like laying a carrot down and then leaving.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:47.640
Do it again.

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:50.200
Set up a camera and that'll be that.

01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:53.160
Or just go to the middle of the office.

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:54.920
Set your arena down.

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:57.960
Yell something about Beyblade.

01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.240
I've never heard it consumed.

01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:01.640
Sorry, this is the one I don't know about, folks.

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:04.520
So you know it's niche.

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:09.560
And then you just fucking rip it into that good bowl.

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:10.840
And if nobody comes around,

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:13.240
then you won't know who the thief is,

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:15.240
but you will know that they're chicken shit.

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:18.120
Does that help?

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:18.600
Yep.

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:19.320
Okay, great.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:25.640
Feel free.

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:26.120
Hello.

01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:26.840
Hello.

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:27.560
Hey, brothers.

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:28.200
Hi, what's up?

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:29.400
How's your day?

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:29.880
Not much.

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:30.920
Just enjoying a great show.

01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:31.880
Oh, thank you.

01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:32.760
So sweet.

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:34.280
Not enough people say that, Kyle.

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:41.960
I like Kyle's double tape magnitude.

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:44.360
What was your name for yourself?

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:44.760
Kate.

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:45.480
Hi, Kate.

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:46.120
What's your question?

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:49.800
I'm here with my brother who came to see the show

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:51.960
just because I asked him to, which is very sweet.

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:54.600
And we were hanging out before the show

01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:56.520
and we decided to start watching John Wick,

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:57.800
which I've never seen.

01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:58.120
Yes.

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:00.600
We're not so great at timing things,

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:04.040
so we only got to about the halfway point of John Wick.

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:04.840
Okay.

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:07.080
And I was hoping that y'all could help me

01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:09.240
feel like I've accomplished both things tonight,

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:11.560
going to a show and watching John Wick,

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:15.320
if you could explain the rest of the plot of John Wick to me.

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.360
Okay, wait, hold on.

01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:19.960
What was the last thing you saw?

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:22.280
No spoilers.

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:25.160
By the way, this will be a spoiler-free summation

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.720
of the plot of John Wick.

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:30.440
What was the last thing you saw before you like,

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:33.320
I assume, hit stop as you walked out the door?

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:35.720
If you say he shot a Russian,

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:37.560
I will have you removed from the theater.

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:39.160
We need some kind of specifics.

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:43.880
There was some cryptic exchanges happening in a hotel.

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:51.640
That actually narrows it down 20%.

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:55.320
To one of the three movies in the John Wick franchise.

01:11:55.320 --> 01:12:01.640
Okay, so John Wick is a pet enthusiast.

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:05.240
Who loves his car.

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:09.240
He, not so much if the car carries through

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.520
to any feature movies.

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:13.880
He's not a gun enthusiast,

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:17.320
but guns are enthusiastic about him.

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:23.160
And so there's the,

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.520
you saw what happened to the dog.

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:25.560
We don't have to get into that.

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:29.240
That's no, some bad stuff happens to a dog

01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:30.520
and that's unfortunate.

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:30.920
Yes.

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:31.640
That's no good.

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:34.680
But that dog was the fuel for the engine

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:37.720
that was John Wick's angry, angry carnage.

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:38.220
Yes.

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:41.960
And there, okay, we said no spoiler.

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:42.920
May I, just for a moment?

01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:43.480
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:44.600
There's a moment at the end.

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:46.520
You skip to the end though.

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:48.440
Yeah, I know, but it ties back in

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:55.240
where George Carlin shows up in a phone booth

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:58.360
and they travel back in time and save the dog.

01:12:58.360 --> 01:12:59.240
Yeah, so it's good.

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:04.760
Hey, and then that dog ushers in

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:07.880
like an eternity of happiness.

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:08.920
Hey, hey.

01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:11.640
He shoots everybody and gets a new dog.

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:15.560
Yeah, but hold on.

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:18.040
There's no, I mean, he shoots everybody

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.200
and then he gets a new dog.

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:22.840
He goes to the dog store and the person's like,

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:23.720
hey, you want a new dog?

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:24.600
They're a hundred dollars.

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.520
And he's like, bang.

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:30.120
All these dogs are mine now.

01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:32.200
It's a really casual pet store.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.520
He also drives a car real cool.

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:35.960
He drives a car real cool.

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:39.560
He shoots like a billion guys.

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:43.080
He like kills the shit out of three young Greyjoys.

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:45.800
You're just wasting time.

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:50.440
He kills everybody and then he gets a new dog.

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:55.080
Feel free to begin John Wick 2

01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:57.480
because now you're caught up.

01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:01.640
He's not going to be riding on the back of a dragon

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:02.760
on John Wick 2 and you're like,

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:04.360
what the fuck did they not tell me?

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:07.560
To be fair though, in John Wick 2 and 3,

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:08.840
a dog dies at the beginning

01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:10.680
and it gets a new better dog at the end.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.200
Everyone, everyone.

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:15.160
It just keeps escalating to a better and better dog.

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:15.480
Right.

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:17.400
Hey, does that help?

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.960
In the last movie, he teams up with dog the bounty hunter

01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:20.280
and it's.

01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:22.840
Does that help?

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:24.040
Is that good?

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.400
That's all extremely helpful.

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:26.120
Thank you.

01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:26.920
So glad we can help.

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:28.200
You can bring the house lights down now.

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:28.920
Thank you so much.

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:34.840
Hey everybody.

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.440
Thank you so much for coming.

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:37.800
That's a beautiful painting.

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:38.840
Yes, thank you.

01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:40.920
And the darkness is here.

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:43.720
Ah, now it's just me and my brothers.

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:46.520
So yeah, thank you all so much.

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:48.200
These last two nights have been wild.

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:49.080
Y'all are wild.

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:49.960
Y'all are so good.

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:51.320
Thank you all so much for coming here.

01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:58.040
It is wild that we were invited to play here

01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:00.520
at Constitution Hall where, you know,

01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:04.600
actual people have performed major big shows.

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:05.400
Thank you everybody.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:06.440
This has been so cool here.

01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:07.000
Thank you so much.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:07.640
Yes, thank you.

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:11.240
Thank you for having us.

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:14.120
So like, we have to leave very early in the morning

01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:15.000
to head to Pittsburgh.

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:18.200
Okay, all right.

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:19.160
Oh, that's weird.

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:21.240
And like, our families are with us and everything,

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:24.040
so we're not going to be able to hang out after the show.

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:24.680
I'm sorry.

01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:25.720
Travis's family's with him.

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:26.520
I'm just tired.

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:30.360
I have to soak my arms in ice.

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:30.840
Yes.

01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:32.600
So yeah, we're not going to hang out after the show,

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:34.840
but we hope that our time with you now

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:40.600
has felt like a close communion with the good Lord above.

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:46.200
And thank you to Paul for all he does for us.

01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:48.440
Thank you to...

01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:55.240
If you haven't already, check out Paulandstorm.gov.biz.

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:56.360
Anyone will get you there.

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:58.440
.net.xxx.

01:15:58.440 --> 01:15:59.640
Yeah, don't go to that one.

01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:04.680
Wait, who do you think bought up the Paulandstorm.xxx?

01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:05.480
Somebody in the audience would write fucking...

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:08.040
Me? Okay, finish it.

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:17.800
Thank you to Schmanners.

01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:18.680
I see you, Paul.

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:19.320
It's a race.

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:24.280
Thank you to Schmanners, our terrific opener.

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.640
Thank you to our dad.

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:31.240
Thanks to Amanda and just everyone

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:32.520
who made these shows possible.

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:35.480
It's been a real hoot, and I don't say that lightly.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.960
That's only the third time I've heard Griffin say the word hoot.

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:42.040
Thanks to John Roderick in the long winters

01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:42.840
for the use of a theme song

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:44.760
and to departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:48.920
Thank you, Maximum Fun, our podcast home.

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:50.440
Yes, thank you, Maximum Fun.

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:53.720
And I have the final Yahoo here.

01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:56.520
I'm gonna read it now.

01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:57.960
The Wi-Fi isn't working.

01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:01.080
Check Paulandstorm.xxx later and see if I pulled it off.

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:03.800
This one was sent in by Seth Carlson.

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:04.840
Thank you, Seth Carlson.

01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:07.160
It's by an anonymous Yahoo Answers user

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:08.360
who, again, is pop...

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:12.280
Oh, a twofer.

01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:17.480
Asks, how the...

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:19.880
I'm gonna add the cuss words in.

01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:23.480
How the fuck did Atlantis get lost?

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:25.880
It's a fucking continent, not a dime.

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.440
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:33.480

I'm Griffin McElroy.

This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:54.520
