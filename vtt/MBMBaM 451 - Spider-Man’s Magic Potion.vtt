WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:49.040
So we come in with me playing, I can go get Rachel's flute and we can do a pay a piper thing.

00:49.840 --> 00:52.960
If you know how to play it at all. No, I think it's better if he doesn't.

00:53.600 --> 00:56.400
Yeah, this is a good idea, Griffin. This is a great idea.

00:56.400 --> 01:00.000
I don't want to go find Rachel's flute. Oh, come on, that's such a good idea.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.160
I'll play it like this. Okay, do it, go.

01:10.320 --> 01:10.880
There it is.

01:10.880 --> 01:22.960
What is going on?

01:30.960 --> 01:33.760
That's a, she's a, she's a shrill on that one, that flute.

01:34.480 --> 01:39.120
So it's the maximum fun drive is now. Did you already say the thing about paying the piper?

01:39.120 --> 01:41.440
No, I haven't done that.

01:43.200 --> 01:47.520
So this is a show that you pay money for to make it better like it is now.

01:47.520 --> 01:48.640
If you can believe it.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.080
If you could even believe that.

01:50.080 --> 01:52.720
You're probably thinking, how could this get any better?

01:52.720 --> 01:58.080
And so I'm Griffin and there's Justin and Travis. What are we, what the fuck are we doing?

01:58.080 --> 02:02.240
This is the one time a year where we say, we try to put on our good suits

02:02.240 --> 02:07.440
and we stand in front of the church and we ask for money for the, you know, the big operation.

02:07.440 --> 02:08.720
Do you hear that noise?

02:08.720 --> 02:09.360
Yeah.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.440
In the back, that's the piper.

02:11.440 --> 02:12.160
There we go.

02:12.160 --> 02:14.240
And they're playing for you.

02:16.080 --> 02:22.000
I mean, technically speaking, that's Elizabeth Whitland and playing a flute solo.

02:23.520 --> 02:24.640
But, but, India Major.

02:24.640 --> 02:28.800
But really the thing is that it's max fun drive time again, folks.

02:28.800 --> 02:33.520
And that means that it's the piper and it's time to pay for all those great hours of entertainment

02:33.520 --> 02:34.640
that you have enjoyed.

02:34.640 --> 02:38.400
I'm going to begin potting Ms. Whitland down a little bit.

02:38.400 --> 02:38.960
Yeah, go ahead.

02:38.960 --> 02:40.400
Thank you, yes, yes, yes.

02:40.400 --> 02:41.200
Here's the deal.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.040
Real quick, let me lay it out.

02:43.040 --> 02:46.080
So maximumfun.org is a donor supported network.

02:46.080 --> 02:48.320
That means that once a year we come to you and we say, hey,

02:48.320 --> 02:50.800
do you love the shows that are on maximumfun.org?

02:50.800 --> 02:56.320
Maybe consider committing to a monthly donation by going to maximumfun.org forward slash donate.

02:56.320 --> 03:00.080
And when you do, you're going to get some rewards and we'll talk more about this later.

03:00.080 --> 03:05.440
But the one thing I wanted to tell you about is in the rewards starting at the five dollar

03:05.440 --> 03:08.560
and included in every level is the bonus content.

03:08.560 --> 03:13.440
And it's like 100 plus hours at this point because it's not just this year's bonus content.

03:13.440 --> 03:15.600
It's every year's bonus content.

03:15.600 --> 03:21.440
And this year we did commentary for episode three of the My Brother, My Brother and Me TV show.

03:22.400 --> 03:28.640
And our amazing and much funnier than us wives did another episode of My Sister-in-law,

03:28.640 --> 03:30.320
My Sister-in-law and Me.

03:30.320 --> 03:31.040
There's an episode.

03:31.040 --> 03:33.200
Worst title since My Brother, My Brother and Me.

03:33.200 --> 03:33.760
That's right.

03:34.640 --> 03:41.920
And we on Adventure Zone played Game of Honey Heist where I DMed and Griffin and Dad and Justin

03:41.920 --> 03:44.000
are bears trying to steal some honey.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.600
Yes, there's there's a lot of great content and we're going to dive more into what the

03:47.600 --> 03:49.200
drive is all about as we move on.

03:49.200 --> 03:53.360
But but, you know, start getting, you know, start flexing that wallet.

03:53.360 --> 03:53.840
Get it limber.

03:53.840 --> 03:57.440
Yeah, start getting wet for donating.

03:57.440 --> 03:58.000
All right.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.600
Justin, you want to do a question?

03:59.600 --> 04:00.480
I would love that.

04:00.480 --> 04:04.640
Or you want to dig around for a bassoon solo on the Internet for 45 minutes?

04:04.640 --> 04:06.400
Maybe a sousaphone.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.640
What's funny about bassoon solos, Griffin?

04:08.640 --> 04:11.120
I don't understand why I would go after a bassoon solo.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.400
That's not a Piper thing.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.800
Well, nothing was funny about a flute solo.

04:14.800 --> 04:18.880
It would have been funny if you guys had fucking like leaned into it and done.

04:18.880 --> 04:23.120
The problem is we started talking 20 minutes before you started playing.

04:23.120 --> 04:26.960
There was no clear delineation of where this episode started.

04:26.960 --> 04:27.760
Yeah.

04:27.760 --> 04:31.840
Well, I was just trying to find the music and you guys are like, I guess this is a show now.

04:31.840 --> 04:32.800
I guess we're doing a show.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.240
We're all trying to find the music.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.120
In our hearts.

04:35.120 --> 04:36.720
I'm trying to find the music right now.

04:38.720 --> 04:39.840
The absolute mad.

04:39.840 --> 04:41.280
The absolute mad lad.

04:41.280 --> 04:42.720
The fucking mad lad.

04:45.280 --> 04:46.640
This is funnier.

04:46.640 --> 04:48.160
Yeah, that's a funny woodwind right there.

04:50.880 --> 04:51.440
You got me.

04:52.640 --> 04:53.840
Bassoons are weird.

04:53.840 --> 04:55.920
I didn't even know bassoons could do that.

04:55.920 --> 04:59.600
Last week, my coworker and I were discussing pets and I mentioned that I was hoping to

04:59.600 --> 05:03.360
upgrade my beta fish to a bigger tank once I saved enough money to do so.

05:03.360 --> 05:03.920
Pointless.

05:05.360 --> 05:08.960
She then told me not to get a tank since she had one she could give me to me.

05:08.960 --> 05:13.120
Obviously, I happily accepted this since it would be free as opposed to the alternative.

05:13.120 --> 05:13.520
Yes.

05:13.520 --> 05:14.320
Thank you.

05:14.320 --> 05:18.400
Today, she showed up at my house with the tank, all its accessories and the fish that

05:18.400 --> 05:20.160
were apparently still using it as a residence.

05:20.160 --> 05:20.720
Oh, no.

05:22.160 --> 05:24.160
I was never told about these fish.

05:24.160 --> 05:28.480
I can't just add my beta with them since betas are extremely territorial and kill most other

05:28.480 --> 05:29.120
fish.

05:29.120 --> 05:33.840
Do I ask her to take the fish back if she doesn't have a tank to keep them in or am

05:33.840 --> 05:36.720
I stuck with the responsibility of owning fish and never wanted the first place?

05:36.720 --> 05:38.640
That's from Aquatically Challenged in Albertville.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.320
This is a terrible situation you find yourself in.

05:40.320 --> 05:40.960
I'm very sorry.

05:40.960 --> 05:46.400
Also, hey, it was very nice of your coworker to give you a free tank or whatever, I guess,

05:46.960 --> 05:52.960
but it's hard for me to condone any pet owner that's like, oh, you want?

05:52.960 --> 05:53.600
Okay, great.

05:53.600 --> 05:57.200
That's like if I said, oh, you need a new crate for your dog?

05:57.200 --> 05:57.840
Cool.

05:57.840 --> 06:00.240
Here's my crate with my dog in it.

06:00.240 --> 06:01.040
Bye.

06:01.040 --> 06:02.560
This is unprecedented.

06:02.560 --> 06:07.680
I don't think you need to feel bad about confronting this person because this is a wild twist and

06:07.680 --> 06:09.520
turn that they've sent you spiraling down.

06:10.480 --> 06:14.240
The reason I said pointless, I interjected that, is because I already knew betas were

06:14.240 --> 06:15.280
very territorial.

06:15.280 --> 06:17.360
You have to have a beta by itself.

06:17.360 --> 06:22.240
You can't even have, I've heard, you can't even have a mirror next to a beta tank because

06:22.240 --> 06:25.360
it'll exhaust itself to death trying to beat its own ass.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.680
This is something that I've heard that I believe is true.

06:27.680 --> 06:30.560
Hold on, that's true of me too if I'm in front of a mirror.

06:30.560 --> 06:31.200
Right.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.160
He'll try to fight himself.

06:32.160 --> 06:33.200
So I said it was pointless.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.720
I don't think fish care, right?

06:36.720 --> 06:41.600
Like a fish, fish are in bags a lot of the time.

06:41.600 --> 06:45.120
One thing I don't think a fish has ever said is, ugh, this sucks.

06:45.120 --> 06:47.280
Like I think fish are just like, it's fine.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.520
A fish in a bag, I'm like, well, I'm in a bag.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.360
That's the way it goes, I guess.

06:51.360 --> 06:55.360
If you get a bigger tank, the fish isn't like, ah, more room for furniture.

06:55.360 --> 06:55.760
Right.

06:55.760 --> 06:56.480
He doesn't care.

06:57.040 --> 07:00.000
The only reason to get a bigger tank is to put more fish in it, right?

07:00.000 --> 07:05.760
He forgets, the fish forgets the other end of the tank by the time it gets to it.

07:05.760 --> 07:08.960
It gets to, it swims to the other end and it's like, oh, hell yeah, look back there.

07:08.960 --> 07:11.200
A whole other part of the tank I've yet to go to.

07:11.200 --> 07:15.040
When we were growing up, we had a fish tank and our dad put that like a sticky-

07:15.040 --> 07:16.800
I still think this story is apocryphal.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.400
Well, we'll get to that in a second.

07:18.400 --> 07:23.840
But he put this like thing on the back that was like just a picture of like undersea kelp

07:23.840 --> 07:26.960
or whatever, I guess, that you like stuck to the back of the tank

07:26.960 --> 07:30.400
as if the fish was like, oh, now I'm back in the ocean.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.520
Oh, kelp, sick.

07:32.400 --> 07:35.840
But also we kept the fish tank in the back room of our house,

07:35.840 --> 07:38.960
which was, I guess, poorly insulated and not heated.

07:38.960 --> 07:42.480
And one very cold winter, it froze solid.

07:42.480 --> 07:45.760
So dad took it to his office to thaw so he could get new fish.

07:45.760 --> 07:48.720
And when it thawed, dad claims all the fish were fine.

07:49.440 --> 07:51.520
Lies, lies, lies from our dad.

07:51.520 --> 07:55.600
And then he said they started to run and play just like they were young again.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.400
Yeah, sure.

07:56.400 --> 08:00.000
I have two solutions for this that I think are both equally amazing.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.200
And one is to arm the other fish.

08:06.640 --> 08:10.000
Arm the other fish with knife and pipe and gun.

08:11.120 --> 08:11.920
Small ones, obviously.

08:11.920 --> 08:16.240
And maybe, you know, let's see, a candlestick, a revolver.

08:16.880 --> 08:18.560
Poison, if you want to.

08:18.560 --> 08:22.640
And then the beta will not have a weapon, but is a weapon.

08:22.640 --> 08:26.800
So there will be a little bit more equal grounds there, I feel like.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.960
And maybe it'll be like a mutually assured destruction thing

08:28.960 --> 08:30.240
and they'll leave each other alone.

08:31.520 --> 08:35.520
And the other solution is you still have the other original tank,

08:35.520 --> 08:36.480
the original small tank.

08:36.480 --> 08:38.160
So you scoop up the other fish

08:38.160 --> 08:44.080
and you do a little, you know, prince and popper swapper-oo.

08:44.080 --> 08:48.240
And, you know, the ones, these fish that were swimming in this big ass tank

08:48.240 --> 08:53.680
living the high life now have to trade places with your beta.

08:53.680 --> 08:56.960
And then they'll learn a little bit about each other's, you know, shoes

08:56.960 --> 08:59.040
and the walks of life that they have to go on.

08:59.680 --> 09:03.440
And they will just die of natural causes

09:03.440 --> 09:06.240
before they can do anything useful with that information.

09:06.240 --> 09:06.800
Yeah.

09:06.800 --> 09:08.960
Might I recommend maybe you put them in that smaller tank

09:08.960 --> 09:10.640
and then you move that across the room.

09:10.640 --> 09:13.200
Still in the line of sight of the beta,

09:13.200 --> 09:15.280
but far enough away that the beta won't try to attack.

09:15.280 --> 09:18.400
And then every day you move that tank one inch closer

09:18.400 --> 09:21.040
and then maybe in like six years, you jump them in.

09:21.760 --> 09:22.480
Oh.

09:22.480 --> 09:24.720
If my experience with fish is any indicator,

09:24.720 --> 09:30.400
one thing you could try is wait just a little bit,

09:30.400 --> 09:32.800
like a month or so.

09:32.800 --> 09:36.000
And the problem will just sort of like sort itself out.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.280
You don't even need to starve them out.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.760
You can treat them like super good

09:39.760 --> 09:43.680
and really super, really, really super duper hope they don't die

09:43.680 --> 09:46.320
because your daughter doesn't even understand what death is.

09:46.320 --> 09:49.680
You could really wish them to do it to live

09:49.680 --> 09:52.240
and try your best to make them live and they won't.

09:52.240 --> 09:53.600
They'll probably bathe it.

09:53.600 --> 09:56.160
You could also, following up on Griffin's thing,

09:56.160 --> 09:58.160
scoop those other fish into the smaller bowl

09:58.160 --> 10:00.400
and then take it back to work and hand it to your coworker

10:00.400 --> 10:04.080
and say, hey, here's your fucking family members you gave me.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.120
Weirdo.

10:05.120 --> 10:08.960
Here's the animals that you are supposed to be responsible for.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.640
Hey, I've got some baby clothes.

10:13.360 --> 10:14.400
I know you're having a baby.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.240
Do you want some of these old baby clothes?

10:16.240 --> 10:16.800
Okay, cool.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.160
My baby's in it.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.440
Fuck you.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.040
For sale baby shoes, never worn.

10:21.040 --> 10:21.760
Yeah, I'll take them.

10:22.640 --> 10:23.120
What the fuck?

10:23.120 --> 10:24.800
There is a baby in this.

10:24.800 --> 10:25.520
Rubble rubble.

10:27.600 --> 10:28.800
You got me again.

10:28.800 --> 10:29.840
Me again.

10:29.840 --> 10:30.960
Hey, I got a butt plug.

10:32.640 --> 10:34.160
Wait, your butt's on it.

10:34.160 --> 10:35.200
Wait a second.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.040
Hey, asshole.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.400
Can I do a Yahoo?

10:38.400 --> 10:38.720
Yes.

10:38.720 --> 10:39.200
I like that, Griff.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.160
I love that butt.

10:40.160 --> 10:41.360
It was sent in by Brendan.

10:41.360 --> 10:42.000
Thanks, Brendan.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.200
It's from Yahoo Answers user.

10:43.200 --> 10:43.840
They're anonymous.

10:43.840 --> 10:46.800
I'll call him Murphy Asks.

10:48.640 --> 10:52.320
Why are tricycles only designed for little kids?

10:52.320 --> 10:52.720
Yes.

10:53.360 --> 10:57.120
Tricycles are a great invention and they should be used by commuting adults

10:57.120 --> 10:58.800
and in sports too.

10:58.800 --> 11:01.360
I don't understand why they are only designed for children

11:01.360 --> 11:04.480
because the ones I saw in the store are all pink and two feet high.

11:05.520 --> 11:06.400
And for sports.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.760
I didn't even think about that.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.280
Didn't think about sports.

11:10.320 --> 11:11.280
Oh, Boise.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.680
Can you imagine lacrosse with tricycles or football with tricycles?

11:17.680 --> 11:18.480
Loving that.

11:18.480 --> 11:19.040
Loving it all.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.400
Swimming with tricycles.

11:20.400 --> 11:21.360
How would you do the kicks?

11:21.920 --> 11:24.480
You would have a foot glued to the tricycle.

11:24.480 --> 11:25.120
Hell yeah.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.400
Now you're cooking.

11:26.400 --> 11:29.840
You fucking Rube Goldberg machine brain heaven motherfucker.

11:29.840 --> 11:30.320
I love it.

11:30.320 --> 11:30.880
I love it.

11:30.880 --> 11:34.320
There's a Yahoo Answers, Yahoo Answers user named Mark.

11:34.320 --> 11:34.960
Sorry, what?

11:35.760 --> 11:36.800
So tired.

11:36.800 --> 11:39.600
Yes, Yahoo Answers user named Mark who says,

11:39.600 --> 11:42.400
Yeah, this is a be all over Yahoo.

11:45.680 --> 11:49.680
Mark says, they're like scooters with training wheels and safer.

11:52.960 --> 11:54.960
I guess they are though.

11:54.960 --> 11:55.920
That's pretty dope.

11:55.920 --> 12:01.440
So I mean, there are those things that you can kind of like prop your knee up on and

12:01.440 --> 12:02.640
kind of push yourself along on.

12:02.640 --> 12:05.840
Those are, I think that is a three wheeled means of conveyance.

12:05.840 --> 12:07.920
There are some three wheeled means of conveyance.

12:07.920 --> 12:13.040
I don't mean to say that there aren't, but the tricycle, the brand tricycle,

12:13.040 --> 12:15.040
I don't think we're using as adults.

12:15.040 --> 12:17.680
Especially, I would say power wheels for adults.

12:18.560 --> 12:19.760
This is a thing.

12:19.760 --> 12:21.120
That's a four wheeled vehicle.

12:21.120 --> 12:22.160
No, what am I thinking of?

12:22.160 --> 12:23.040
Big wheels.

12:23.040 --> 12:24.800
Big wheels for adults.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.160
That's what I want.

12:26.160 --> 12:28.400
Did they ever make big power wheels?

12:30.560 --> 12:34.240
You know, a vehicle you can get in and drive around, but for adults.

12:34.240 --> 12:40.800
A motorized three wheeled big boy tricycle for big adults like me, but I would do mine

12:40.800 --> 12:42.560
up so it looked like the motorcycle in Akira.

12:42.560 --> 12:47.920
Can you fucking imagine me just like doing a brake slide into the parking lot of the

12:47.920 --> 12:52.800
Target in my sick ass big monster wheel power boy?

12:52.800 --> 12:57.360
Now they do have three wheeled motorcycles, but I've always thought that if I tried

12:57.360 --> 13:03.040
to roll up to like a super cool biker bar in one of those, they would not accept me

13:03.040 --> 13:04.240
as one of their own.

13:04.240 --> 13:05.600
And that's so important.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.120
All we want is acceptance in this life.

13:07.120 --> 13:07.360
Right?

13:07.360 --> 13:11.440
They would let me, listen, they'd let me in and I would be allowed to hang out there,

13:11.440 --> 13:15.120
but I'd never really feel like I was actually part of the gang.

13:15.120 --> 13:19.120
They'd let me in, but when they were planning events or whatever, they would forget to call

13:19.120 --> 13:22.080
me, but if I was there, they'd let me in.

13:22.080 --> 13:22.640
You know what I mean?

13:22.640 --> 13:26.560
But like, I would always be on the outside looking in.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.720
You roll up at those big power wheels.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.320
Now you're a son of anarchy.

13:30.320 --> 13:31.280
Oh, yes I am.

13:31.280 --> 13:32.800
I might be the dad of anarchy.

13:33.840 --> 13:34.480
Is that a bad thing?

13:34.480 --> 13:35.520
Is that a good thing or bad thing?

13:35.520 --> 13:36.320
I did not see the show.

13:36.320 --> 13:38.000
To be a dad of anarchy or a son?

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
It's any family member of anarchy.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.440
I imagine they got up to some pretty nice people and shit.

13:41.440 --> 13:45.040
I would not want to be a family member of anarchy because it would make planning events

13:45.040 --> 13:45.920
really hard.

13:45.920 --> 13:46.480
That's true.

13:46.480 --> 13:48.640
Some of them were bad, but some of them were nice.

13:48.640 --> 13:49.760
Is this sort of the short version?

13:49.760 --> 13:50.720
Whoa, okay.

13:50.720 --> 13:51.200
Whoa.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.760
And I bet that's where a lot of the conflict came from.

13:53.760 --> 13:55.760
Yeah, that is actually, thank you.

13:55.760 --> 13:56.480
Yes, Travis.

13:56.480 --> 13:57.200
Okay.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.760
Did they ever hurt each other with like weapons and stuff?

14:00.880 --> 14:02.240
Like badass fights?

14:02.240 --> 14:03.280
Like was there a part where one was like-

14:03.280 --> 14:07.440
Do you want me to summarize the events of the first seasons of Sons of Anarchy?

14:07.440 --> 14:08.320
No, no.

14:08.320 --> 14:09.280
The whole show, please.

14:09.280 --> 14:10.000
Yeah, the whole show.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.320
And I want to know how many badass weapon fights they did.

14:12.320 --> 14:16.240
So there, they definitely, there was definitely shooting.

14:16.240 --> 14:17.040
Okay.

14:17.040 --> 14:20.560
And I think they probably fought with fists a lot.

14:20.560 --> 14:20.960
What?

14:20.960 --> 14:22.480
Did they use bow and arrows or guns?

14:23.120 --> 14:23.600
Guns.

14:23.600 --> 14:24.240
Yes, guns.

14:24.240 --> 14:24.640
Thank you.

14:24.640 --> 14:25.280
Yes.

14:25.280 --> 14:29.280
And there was a lot of bad looks, you know what I mean?

14:30.240 --> 14:31.920
That can cut the deepest, you know?

14:31.920 --> 14:32.880
Yeah, for sure.

14:32.880 --> 14:34.480
There were some harsh words said.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.920
I thought that bike fights were only supposed to happen with chains.

14:38.480 --> 14:41.440
I guess I'm going off road rash and that's not an accurate,

14:41.440 --> 14:46.800
I guess it's not a historical look at the sort of bike life was road rash.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.960
Can we do another question though?

14:48.960 --> 14:51.920
My boss keeps asking me if I want to buy tickets

14:51.920 --> 14:54.320
to go see his amateur production of My Fair Lady.

14:54.320 --> 14:55.840
How do I decline politely?

14:56.480 --> 14:58.880
He has handed out the flyer to me twice already.

15:01.040 --> 15:03.920
That's from not so fair a lady in Newcastle.

15:04.960 --> 15:05.280
Okay.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.120
Maybe try like when next time your boss does say like,

15:09.120 --> 15:10.640
oh, I've already seen it.

15:10.640 --> 15:11.760
Yeah, thank you.

15:11.760 --> 15:15.360
That would be a great excuse if you could use it for any community

15:15.360 --> 15:16.800
or local theater production.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.400
Just be like, oh, you're doing Godspell?

15:18.400 --> 15:19.760
I seen it already.

15:19.760 --> 15:23.200
I've already seen My Fair Lady at the end.

15:23.200 --> 15:24.960
She does learn to talk good.

15:24.960 --> 15:28.080
I wish I hadn't seen it already.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.280
That was so thoughtless of me

15:29.280 --> 15:31.600
because I read Pygmalion when I was fucking 12.

15:32.160 --> 15:35.600
And I know all the different things in it and all the jokes and stuff.

15:35.600 --> 15:38.480
All she wants is a room somewhere and then she gets it.

15:39.280 --> 15:42.400
No, you see our production is special because it does.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.040
Oh, did you change it and now she doesn't learn to talk good?

15:45.600 --> 15:46.960
No, it's still very much.

15:46.960 --> 15:50.800
Oh yeah, I know that version.

15:50.800 --> 15:52.480
He likes her face or whatever.

15:52.480 --> 15:53.280
Shoot.

15:53.280 --> 15:58.080
I think you could probably just tell them that Justin hates My Fair Lady

15:58.080 --> 16:00.720
and that would be enough to sort of wave it off.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.640
That tells them everything they need to know.

16:02.640 --> 16:05.520
I would love to, but I took a pledge to Justin McElroy

16:05.520 --> 16:07.520
that I wouldn't support My Fair Lady.

16:07.520 --> 16:09.120
Sorry, it stinks on ice.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.360
You hear that, Eliza Doolittle?

16:13.360 --> 16:15.040
Justin's coming for you.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.600
Maybe if someone says, hey, do you want to go see My Fair Lady?

16:17.600 --> 16:20.480
You can say, I can't, I have a fucking cribbage game that day

16:20.480 --> 16:22.400
because I'm 80 years old, apparently.

16:22.400 --> 16:23.680
No, wait, that's right.

16:23.680 --> 16:27.200
I'm not 80 years old, so no, I will not see My Fair Lady.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.920
Or just say, I don't have to go to community theater

16:29.920 --> 16:31.920
because I'm not related to you.

16:31.920 --> 16:33.840
Because I think contractually,

16:33.840 --> 16:36.880
that's the only time you have to go to community theater.

16:36.880 --> 16:38.720
So your boss comes to you and they say,

16:39.600 --> 16:42.400
Philip, I would really appreciate it

16:42.400 --> 16:44.240
if you care to see my production of My Fair Lady

16:44.240 --> 16:47.360
and you look at your boss and go, dad?

16:49.680 --> 16:50.240
What do you mean?

16:51.600 --> 16:54.080
Are you my dad?

16:55.200 --> 16:56.640
No, I don't know why you would think that.

16:56.640 --> 17:01.040
Well, why the fuck else would I go see that old ass whack shit?

17:02.960 --> 17:04.080
Do something good.

17:04.080 --> 17:07.120
Yeah, ask him, ask him, say, I'd love to.

17:07.120 --> 17:08.720
I'd love to get out and consume the arts

17:08.720 --> 17:09.600
and support your work.

17:09.600 --> 17:11.600
Can you guys do a different show, though?

17:11.600 --> 17:12.720
Can you do a different one?

17:12.720 --> 17:13.840
Learn a new one.

17:13.840 --> 17:16.560
Do Seussical, Seussical's fun.

17:16.560 --> 17:18.320
Everyone loves it, it's fun songs.

17:19.120 --> 17:19.680
Bright colors.

17:19.680 --> 17:22.000
I'm not saying I don't support community theater.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.480
I just don't support My Fair Lady.

17:24.480 --> 17:26.880
It's all about a man trying to change a woman.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.160
Fuck My Fair Lady.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.360
Hey, here's one for you.

17:29.360 --> 17:31.680
Starlight Express, they're all on roller skates.

17:31.680 --> 17:32.800
Are you kidding me?

17:32.800 --> 17:33.440
Oh, hell yeah, dude.

17:33.440 --> 17:36.880
A musical about a bunch of people that are a train?

17:36.880 --> 17:38.960
If you want to do a show, that's a show.

17:38.960 --> 17:39.920
Fuck yeah.

17:39.920 --> 17:42.400
Do it in the round, are you kidding me with this?

17:42.400 --> 17:43.840
Do Equus.

17:43.840 --> 17:45.360
I'll go see Equus.

17:45.360 --> 17:46.160
What about your town?

17:46.160 --> 17:47.680
That's the ones about piss.

17:47.680 --> 17:48.180
Yeah.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.200
Have you seen the Piss Show, boss?

17:51.200 --> 17:51.920
Have you seen it?

17:51.920 --> 17:53.040
It's fun.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.000
It's fun.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.280
And it hasn't been done a bajillion times.

17:57.280 --> 17:58.560
Do you know about Muppets?

17:58.560 --> 18:00.000
What if they said fuck?

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Avenue Q, go see it.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.720
You think you know the Founding Fathers, but guess what?

18:04.720 --> 18:06.080
These ones rap.

18:06.080 --> 18:07.120
These ones do rap.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.160
What if they rap?

18:08.160 --> 18:09.520
What if they rap, though?

18:09.520 --> 18:13.840
Go do a good one that nobody hates, like me.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.840
Go see a good theater.

18:16.880 --> 18:19.440
Well, make a good theater.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.120
Make a good theater.

18:21.120 --> 18:23.840
Show up at the theater with your money,

18:23.840 --> 18:28.320
and they say it will cost you $15 to see My Fair Lady.

18:28.320 --> 18:31.360
And you just ask, what else is showing tonight?

18:32.240 --> 18:34.320
I'd like to see my boss in a different musical, please.

18:34.320 --> 18:35.200
I'd love to.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.200
What's playing in the black box?

18:37.200 --> 18:38.480
Can you tell me now?

18:38.480 --> 18:41.040
What's your experimental show?

18:42.080 --> 18:45.040
The Curious Case of the Dog of the Night-Time, perhaps?

18:45.040 --> 18:46.080
I'll make you a deal.

18:46.080 --> 18:47.280
I wanna support you.

18:47.280 --> 18:48.720
I wanna support what you're doing.

18:48.720 --> 18:49.760
So here's what I'm gonna do.

18:50.400 --> 18:53.360
I'm gonna buy a ticket to go see your show,

18:53.360 --> 18:56.160
and then I'm gonna use that ticket to go see Captain Marvel.

18:57.040 --> 18:58.960
You will know that it is in your name,

18:58.960 --> 19:00.400
and I've already supported you,

19:00.400 --> 19:05.200
but I will be going to see the latest from Mr. Marvel

19:05.200 --> 19:09.280
and his incredible inventions.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.440
I've both agreed to support you and Jim Marvel,

19:17.440 --> 19:23.600
and I've just known Jim longer, so I think I'm good.

19:23.600 --> 19:25.440
I wanna see the latest confection

19:25.440 --> 19:29.600
from the Mighty Marvel Power Rangers and all of their folks,

19:29.600 --> 19:30.160
and I will-

19:30.160 --> 19:32.560
I have to find out what happened with Thanos or whatever.

19:32.560 --> 19:39.680
Your dusty, rot-ridden, steamer trunk of a production

19:40.640 --> 19:45.360
sucks so hard and doesn't even have one fucking mutant in it.

19:45.360 --> 19:46.960
I don't say fuck at all.

19:46.960 --> 19:52.240
If you do a R-rated My Fair Lady, maybe I'm in.

19:52.240 --> 19:56.640
You're fucking raiding Spain for spending the fucking planes.

19:57.440 --> 19:58.400
Isn't it?

19:58.400 --> 19:59.360
Isn't it, guys?

19:59.360 --> 20:02.400
Griffin, I didn't know you were into grime.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.040
Oh, man.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.840
Can you guys do Benjamin Button?

20:05.840 --> 20:07.600
Did they make a play of that yet?

20:07.600 --> 20:08.240
Definitely.

20:08.880 --> 20:10.720
Do a play of the Button Man.

20:10.720 --> 20:12.000
Curious Jam of Button Man.

20:12.000 --> 20:12.640
Yeah.

20:12.640 --> 20:13.600
Love it, love it.

20:14.720 --> 20:18.800
Griffin, how would you guys feel about Yahoo?

20:18.800 --> 20:20.400
Because that would go down pretty smooth for me.

20:20.400 --> 20:21.200
Or should we-

20:21.200 --> 20:23.680
I think we should do a Max Fun Drive segment.

20:23.680 --> 20:23.920
Yeah, let's do it.

20:23.920 --> 20:27.280
Yeah, let's talk about our charge here, our cause,

20:27.280 --> 20:28.640
the reason we were put on this Earth.

20:28.640 --> 20:29.600
The reason for the season.

20:29.600 --> 20:30.480
The reason for the season.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.840
It's Max Fun Drive time.

20:33.840 --> 20:34.880
We've been a part of the network now.

20:34.880 --> 20:37.200
This is our eighth Max Fun Drive, I believe, which is-

20:37.200 --> 20:37.760
Oh, boy.

20:38.400 --> 20:39.680
It's really, really wild.

20:39.680 --> 20:43.040
And every year, you all have come out to support us.

20:43.040 --> 20:47.520
And your support has been immeasurable and remarkable

20:47.520 --> 20:49.520
and has changed our lives and allowed us to turn this

20:49.520 --> 20:51.920
into our full-time jobs.

20:51.920 --> 20:54.800
And so when you donate, you get to pick directly

20:54.800 --> 20:56.720
where your money goes to, which shows

20:56.720 --> 20:58.800
you want to support directly.

20:58.800 --> 21:03.120
And so, yeah, it is a very direct way to help out

21:03.120 --> 21:05.040
the people who make things that you like,

21:05.040 --> 21:07.840
whether it's us or whoever else at Max Fun.

21:07.840 --> 21:09.280
We love being a part of the network

21:09.280 --> 21:12.880
and get really excited to tell you about this thing

21:12.880 --> 21:13.840
they do every year.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.200
Also, you should get excited because you can get

21:15.200 --> 21:16.320
some dope shit.

21:16.320 --> 21:19.920
Like, and then you guys jump in and you start talking about-

21:19.920 --> 21:22.000
Well, the number one thing that you get,

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
and listen, there's some material goods you get too,

21:24.000 --> 21:27.120
but I sincerely believe the bonus content is the best.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.880
Like, there's video stuff in there.

21:28.880 --> 21:31.200
There's us, like, riffing on old school,

21:31.200 --> 21:32.480
like, educational films.

21:32.480 --> 21:34.320
God, we made that, like, six years ago now.

21:34.320 --> 21:35.600
We made that so long ago.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.120
I know, and it's still there.

21:37.680 --> 21:39.840
You get bonus episodes of content

21:39.840 --> 21:41.200
you're not gonna hear anywhere else.

21:41.840 --> 21:44.560
We have, last year for the Adventure Zone,

21:44.560 --> 21:47.520
there's us playing four Sherlock Holmeses

21:47.520 --> 21:50.560
and a vampire who is one of the aforementioned

21:50.560 --> 21:52.160
Sherlock Holmeses, I think is the-

21:52.160 --> 21:53.120
Which is real good.

21:53.120 --> 21:55.040
I think one of the silliest things we've ever done.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.160
There's My Brother, My Brother, Me episodes

21:58.160 --> 21:59.440
you're not gonna hear anywhere else.

21:59.440 --> 22:02.080
There's an episode we did where we asked each other

22:02.080 --> 22:02.880
for advice.

22:02.880 --> 22:04.800
There's an episode with Dad.

22:06.240 --> 22:08.480
There's a lot of episodes where we ask each other for advice.

22:08.480 --> 22:09.920
Yeah, it's all in there.

22:10.880 --> 22:14.320
And not just us, you get to hear every show on the network.

22:14.320 --> 22:15.680
It's incredible.

22:15.680 --> 22:18.000
I care about material goods, though, unlike my brother.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.960
So if you go to maximumfund.org forward slash donate

22:20.960 --> 22:22.880
and you can pledge $10 a month,

22:22.880 --> 22:25.200
you are going to get the aforementioned bonus content

22:25.200 --> 22:27.440
and a pin.

22:27.440 --> 22:28.800
You can choose every pin you want,

22:28.800 --> 22:29.840
but if you do the smart thing

22:29.840 --> 22:32.640
and choose the Megan Lencott design pin

22:33.280 --> 22:36.480
that is for our show, it looks like a pizza

22:36.480 --> 22:39.680
that I think has a face in it, but it's ghoulish

22:39.680 --> 22:41.120
and it says Munch Squad on it.

22:41.120 --> 22:41.760
Yeah.

22:41.760 --> 22:42.960
And I think you're really gonna appreciate that.

22:42.960 --> 22:46.880
At $20 a month, there's a beautiful 550-piece

22:46.880 --> 22:51.760
maximum fun puzzle that you can put together or not.

22:51.760 --> 22:55.120
There's a $35 monthly membership level.

22:55.120 --> 22:56.800
And at that level, you're gonna get the poster.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.400
You're gonna get the pin.

22:58.400 --> 22:59.360
You're gonna get the puzzle.

22:59.360 --> 23:00.160
There's no poster.

23:02.800 --> 23:04.640
Let's list some stuff you're not gonna get.

23:04.640 --> 23:05.920
You're not gonna get a poster.

23:05.920 --> 23:07.600
You're not gonna get a new pair of shoes.

23:07.600 --> 23:10.240
You're not gonna get, I don't know.

23:10.240 --> 23:12.640
I was gonna say a hug, but if you see me at a convention

23:12.640 --> 23:14.720
and you say, I'm a donor, I'll give you a hug.

23:14.720 --> 23:16.720
Yeah, you get something that rhymes with hug

23:16.720 --> 23:17.760
and it's mug.

23:17.760 --> 23:18.160
Yeah.

23:18.160 --> 23:19.920
A mug, a monthly membership mug

23:19.920 --> 23:22.000
with the max fun rocket on it.

23:22.000 --> 23:26.000
And we just, that's a good chunk of money,

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
but if you get a lot of entertainment out of it,

23:28.560 --> 23:31.600
we don't force you to donate anything like Netflix does.

23:31.600 --> 23:32.560
I guess it's not really donating at that point.

23:32.560 --> 23:33.600
It's not a donation at that point.

23:33.600 --> 23:34.480
That's just money cost.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.520
It's paying it for a service.

23:35.520 --> 23:38.480
But if our shows mean something to you

23:38.480 --> 23:40.960
and you wanna help us make them,

23:40.960 --> 23:43.280
then go to maximumfund.org forward slash donate

23:43.280 --> 23:45.120
and you can help us do just that.

23:45.120 --> 23:47.680
And I will say, your donations go a long way.

23:47.680 --> 23:50.720
Even if you're like, I can only do $5 a month.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.560
Like really, is that such a big deal?

23:52.560 --> 23:53.360
But here's the thing.

23:53.360 --> 23:57.200
At this point, all of us and, well,

23:57.200 --> 23:59.520
so all of us are full-time podcasters

23:59.520 --> 24:01.120
and our wives do shows with us.

24:01.120 --> 24:02.400
Our dad does shows with us.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.320
Dad was an entertainer, but okay.

24:05.120 --> 24:09.120
Dad was able to retire and now like podcasting

24:09.120 --> 24:12.000
is pretty much the main focus of our family.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.160
And that is because of the years of support

24:14.160 --> 24:15.760
from listeners and donors like you.

24:15.760 --> 24:18.000
And we have a lot more projects

24:18.000 --> 24:19.040
and a lot of things coming up

24:19.040 --> 24:20.640
that we're very excited about.

24:20.640 --> 24:22.240
And we're only able to focus on them

24:22.240 --> 24:24.720
because of support from you.

24:24.720 --> 24:26.320
And the network has grown.

24:26.320 --> 24:28.320
I feel like just in the last like six months,

24:28.320 --> 24:29.920
the number of shows has doubled.

24:29.920 --> 24:30.800
It's blown up right now.

24:31.840 --> 24:33.120
Thank you all so much for your support.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.520
If you're already a member,

24:35.520 --> 24:38.720
if you can try to signal boost it on social media

24:38.720 --> 24:40.480
with the hashtag maxfunddriver,

24:40.480 --> 24:42.720
a link to maximumfund.org slash donate.

24:42.720 --> 24:45.680
Or maybe consider bumping up your donation

24:45.680 --> 24:49.120
if you're listening to more shows on the network

24:49.120 --> 24:50.080
than you did last year.

24:50.080 --> 24:53.120
Also, I mean, make sure that it would be a great thing to do

24:53.120 --> 24:55.760
to make sure that like your card is still working.

24:55.760 --> 24:58.160
And that is just sort of a natural thing

24:58.160 --> 24:59.440
of being a pledge supported network

24:59.440 --> 25:02.000
is we just lose a lot of donors

25:02.000 --> 25:03.920
just from cards expiring and stuff like that.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.800
So there's ways to get involved

25:06.800 --> 25:08.160
no matter where you're at in life.

25:08.160 --> 25:09.760
We should mention, by the way,

25:09.760 --> 25:12.880
those gifts aside from the bonus material,

25:12.880 --> 25:15.920
those gifts are for new and upgrading donors.

25:15.920 --> 25:18.080
So if you're already at, let's say, the $10 level,

25:18.080 --> 25:19.360
you're not gonna get the pin.

25:19.360 --> 25:21.920
But if you update to the $20 level,

25:21.920 --> 25:27.040
then you'll get all the $20 and the $10 and the $5 stuff.

25:27.040 --> 25:28.640
Yeah, all the stuff.

25:28.640 --> 25:29.600
Let's get back to the show.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.200
Maximumfund.org slash donate.

25:31.200 --> 25:32.080
Think about it.

25:32.080 --> 25:35.440
And now did you wanna have me start reading again Yahoo

25:35.440 --> 25:37.360
and then you interrupt it or what's up?

25:37.360 --> 25:39.360
I wasn't-

25:39.360 --> 25:40.560
You gotta understand, man,

25:40.560 --> 25:42.640
you've established a pattern of-

25:42.640 --> 25:43.760
It's hurtful.

25:43.760 --> 25:44.640
Trickery.

25:44.640 --> 25:48.000
The thing is, Justin, you don't protest too much

25:48.000 --> 25:49.440
when you ask for a Yahoo

25:49.440 --> 25:50.240
because you'll say like,

25:50.240 --> 25:52.640
oh, you know what, I would just love a Yahoo.

25:52.640 --> 25:54.640
Oh, Griffin, if only you would do a Yahoo,

25:54.640 --> 25:57.360
that would be the balm on my soul.

25:57.360 --> 25:59.200
Yeah, I'm so wet for Yahoo's, I'm so wet.

25:59.200 --> 26:02.320
And then here's one that was sent in by Brendan.

26:02.320 --> 26:03.520
Thank you, Brendan.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.040
Okay, I do have one,

26:05.040 --> 26:06.960
but I just didn't want it to be this big hostile thing.

26:08.880 --> 26:09.520
All right, well, go ahead.

26:09.520 --> 26:11.280
I'll do Brendan's shit later.

26:11.280 --> 26:13.440
Okay, I mean, I do have one.

26:13.440 --> 26:14.000
Okay.

26:14.000 --> 26:14.800
I just didn't want it to be-

26:17.520 --> 26:18.000
What?

26:18.000 --> 26:19.360
No, it's good, no, it's good.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.920
No, no, no, because now it doesn't feel like a trick.

26:21.920 --> 26:24.400
Now it feels like a natural flow.

26:24.400 --> 26:25.040
It feels like we're in a flow.

26:25.040 --> 26:27.040
Yeah, but if the music doesn't interrupt you-

26:27.040 --> 26:28.080
Okay, so I'll start over.

26:28.080 --> 26:28.560
You know what?

26:28.560 --> 26:29.840
I'll take this one for Griffin.

26:29.840 --> 26:30.880
Would you like to interrupt me?

26:31.440 --> 26:32.800
Yeah, that would be good, actually.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.000
Talk about some dumb shit.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.840
Okay, I wanna take a chance here to tell you guys

26:37.840 --> 26:39.120
how much I love-

26:39.120 --> 26:41.040
I was just gonna say how much I love you.

26:41.040 --> 26:44.720
It just means a lot to me to be able to make this show.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.240
I want a munch, squad.

26:50.240 --> 26:52.080
It does hurt.

26:52.080 --> 26:54.880
I want a munch, squad.

27:01.040 --> 27:03.680
Are y'all down with Guy Fieri yet or what?

27:04.240 --> 27:05.600
I think so.

27:05.600 --> 27:08.160
Down with or down on Guy Fieri?

27:08.160 --> 27:09.520
Down around?

27:09.520 --> 27:11.680
Down by Guy Fieri, because he is-

27:11.680 --> 27:13.920
Now that time it sounded like you said down by him.

27:14.560 --> 27:15.120
I did.

27:15.120 --> 27:17.280
Down by Guy Fieri.

27:17.280 --> 27:22.000
Yeah, just take a left on second and I'm down by Guy Fieri.

27:22.000 --> 27:22.720
You can't miss me.

27:23.280 --> 27:27.440
So good news for everybody on Earth,

27:27.440 --> 27:28.960
especially those in Miami.

27:28.960 --> 27:29.600
Chicken Guy.

27:32.160 --> 27:33.840
Let me say it again, because there's an exclamation point

27:33.840 --> 27:34.160
at the end.

27:34.160 --> 27:36.640
Chicken Guy is a fast-

27:36.640 --> 27:41.280
Chicken Guy.

27:41.280 --> 27:48.000
It's a fast casual chain dedicated to the serving delicious succulent chicken.

27:50.320 --> 27:58.480
Paired with 22 signature sauces meant to please all palates.

27:58.480 --> 28:00.640
Hey, Guy, that's so many sauces.

28:01.600 --> 28:02.880
Okay, here's two different sauces.

28:02.880 --> 28:03.920
One is ranch.

28:03.920 --> 28:04.640
One is ranch.

28:04.640 --> 28:07.760
We threw down some stairs and then went and got it and gave it to you.

28:08.560 --> 28:10.240
That's two different ones.

28:10.240 --> 28:14.320
You can't have 22 or something and call them all signature sauces, right?

28:14.320 --> 28:16.320
You can't put your signature on all these.

28:16.320 --> 28:20.400
Like, if I sign my name 22 different ways, that's not my signature.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.960
Leave a little meat on the bone for the rest of us, Guy.

28:24.160 --> 28:24.720
Literally.

28:24.720 --> 28:28.880
The menu at Chicken Guy features, you guessed it, fucking chicken.

28:28.880 --> 28:30.000
All natural-

28:30.000 --> 28:31.280
Chicken idiot.

28:31.280 --> 28:32.640
How can you even read this?

28:32.640 --> 28:36.880
All natural fresh chicken tenders, hand pounded, perfect.

28:38.480 --> 28:39.280
Nice.

28:39.280 --> 28:39.840
Perfect.

28:40.720 --> 28:41.520
Hand pounded.

28:42.240 --> 28:45.760
Ass slammed, just fucking primo meat.

28:45.760 --> 28:47.600
Fucking shad rack chicken.

28:50.480 --> 28:51.840
Hand pounded to maxi-

28:52.560 --> 28:54.960
Finger blasted, just fucking-

28:54.960 --> 28:56.960
Just reached around to all of us.

28:56.960 --> 28:57.840
Oh, God.

28:57.840 --> 29:04.800
Okay, fresh chicken tenders, hand pounded to maximize crunch.

29:04.800 --> 29:05.760
Oh, golly.

29:06.320 --> 29:11.440
Hey, hand pounded to maximize crunch and paired with a wide selection of delicious sauces.

29:11.440 --> 29:14.560
Hey, PR writer, you just said you got 22.

29:15.280 --> 29:17.040
Like, we know it's a wide selection.

29:17.040 --> 29:20.240
Stop fucking bragging and tell us about hand pounding chicken.

29:20.240 --> 29:23.600
These are brine and fresh lemon juice.

29:24.240 --> 29:25.040
Pickle brine.

29:25.040 --> 29:26.720
Why is it called pickle brine?

29:26.720 --> 29:27.680
You know, we're brining it.

29:27.680 --> 29:28.400
It's brining.

29:28.400 --> 29:34.320
It's brining in fresh lemon juice, pickle brine and buttermilk and infused with-

29:34.320 --> 29:36.080
I don't think you brine and buttermilk, though.

29:36.080 --> 29:38.800
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you don't combine lemon juice and buttermilk.

29:38.800 --> 29:44.800
I'm pretty sure that's not part of the process for your brining and buttermilk infused with

29:44.800 --> 29:50.240
fresh herbs and these tenders deliver on flavor and texture.

29:50.240 --> 29:51.920
We already know they're crunchy.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.840
The menu features the tenders.

29:53.840 --> 29:55.360
Grilled or fried.

29:57.040 --> 30:02.080
I love these chicken tenders, but I want to strip away a lot of the excess and really

30:02.080 --> 30:05.200
just enjoy the flavor of them.

30:05.200 --> 30:09.440
Yeah, I want to see the knuckle marks from where Guy Fieri unleashed his rage with his

30:09.440 --> 30:11.120
bare hands on these fucking things.

30:12.320 --> 30:15.840
I mean, when you say hand pounded, you're insinuating the guy pounded them all, right?

30:15.840 --> 30:16.320
Yeah.

30:16.320 --> 30:17.840
That's what the insinuation is.

30:19.200 --> 30:20.560
You can have them in sandwiches.

30:21.680 --> 30:22.400
Straight up.

30:22.400 --> 30:27.200
Straight up on skewers or in meal-sized salad bowls.

30:27.840 --> 30:32.000
Your choice of signature sauces to enjoy with the chicken as well.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.080
We know, okay?

30:34.080 --> 30:36.160
You have sauce in a lot of it.

30:36.160 --> 30:38.240
We can have whatever we want.

30:38.240 --> 30:38.960
Please.

30:38.960 --> 30:40.320
Just a double check.

30:40.320 --> 30:45.760
You can get on a sandwich, on skewers, or on salad, but there is no just-

30:46.480 --> 30:47.600
Can I just have it?

30:47.600 --> 30:49.360
We can't just give them to you.

30:49.360 --> 30:51.040
Can you just hand me a Tendo?

30:51.040 --> 30:55.520
There's going to be a lot of skewers eaten in Miami.

30:55.520 --> 31:00.240
There's going to be a great deal of skewers just getting accidentally chomped down the gullet.

31:00.240 --> 31:03.200
They're so delicious, they're worried that you'll try to eat your fingers off

31:04.080 --> 31:05.280
if it's touching the chicken.

31:06.240 --> 31:13.280
There are sides, like chicken guy fries with Guy's special fry seasoning.

31:13.280 --> 31:14.720
There's crowd-pleasing mac daddy-

31:14.720 --> 31:15.220
Salt!

31:16.480 --> 31:17.840
It's salt and red stuff.

31:17.840 --> 31:20.880
It's some red stuff I found.

31:20.880 --> 31:23.760
I don't know what the red stuff is, but it hurts everyone's mouth.

31:26.480 --> 31:31.040
I want to retroactively enjoy that they're called meal-sized salad bowls.

31:33.440 --> 31:35.120
Guy Fieri looked at the salad and he's like,

31:35.120 --> 31:36.800
what the fuck is this supposed to be?

31:37.360 --> 31:38.400
It's not a meal?

31:39.440 --> 31:40.720
What are you having for lunch?

31:40.720 --> 31:41.360
This salad.

31:41.360 --> 31:42.160
The fuck you are!

31:42.960 --> 31:44.080
Where's your lunch?

31:44.080 --> 31:45.920
I'm going to punch a hole in this beach ball.

31:45.920 --> 31:48.080
Let's just fill this motherfucker up with salad.

31:48.080 --> 31:48.960
Now that's a meal.

31:50.080 --> 31:50.880
Now give me a minute.

31:50.880 --> 31:53.600
You might hear me slapping my chicken in the back room.

31:53.600 --> 31:55.360
Yeah, I gotta punish it.

31:55.360 --> 31:56.640
It's been a bad chicken.

31:57.200 --> 32:00.640
Chicken Guy offers two delicious Flavortown frozen treats as well.

32:01.600 --> 32:04.560
Guests can satisfy their sweet tooth with the triple double...

32:08.640 --> 32:10.160
Triple double ice cream treat.

32:10.160 --> 32:11.040
That's a six.

32:12.560 --> 32:14.560
With triple chocolate and double mint.

32:14.560 --> 32:18.000
Or the cinnamon apple.

32:21.600 --> 32:26.080
Which isn't as utilitarian as I was hoping from the name.

32:26.080 --> 32:28.400
Anyway, I don't know much about fruit,

32:28.400 --> 32:33.360
so I found this weird, this weird juicy red sweet chicken in the back.

32:33.360 --> 32:37.520
And I rubbed this spicy dust all over it.

32:37.520 --> 32:39.520
And I guess this is dessert.

32:39.520 --> 32:40.400
Is this anything?

32:42.240 --> 32:43.280
We have cinnamon apple.

32:43.280 --> 32:44.720
We have sugar disc.

32:44.720 --> 32:46.000
You're gonna love these.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.360
Hey, hey, Valerie, bad news.

32:49.360 --> 32:50.640
All our onions went bad.

32:51.680 --> 32:53.040
Those are apples, Guy.

32:53.040 --> 32:53.840
Are you kidding me?

32:54.800 --> 32:56.240
These sweet apples are delicious.

32:57.040 --> 33:00.560
I'm gonna put my special fry stuff on them and see what happens.

33:02.160 --> 33:07.440
Fieri, a chef, TV personality, entrepreneur, and New York Times bestselling author.

33:07.440 --> 33:11.840
You know, it's fun to imagine a person that doesn't know who Guy Fieri is,

33:11.840 --> 33:14.400
but did read those first three paragraphs.

33:14.400 --> 33:15.760
Like, who is this?

33:15.760 --> 33:16.640
I am hooked.

33:17.360 --> 33:18.080
I love it.

33:18.080 --> 33:22.160
Once again, creating blends of spices and seasoning.

33:22.160 --> 33:23.120
Oh my God.

33:23.120 --> 33:26.400
He's brought his signature blend of authentic meats,

33:26.400 --> 33:29.680
surprising flavors to Chicken Guy.

33:29.680 --> 33:32.960
Once again, creating blends of spices and seasonings

33:32.960 --> 33:35.600
that keep his fans coming back for more.

33:35.600 --> 33:38.880
I do appreciate that they are honest enough to admit

33:38.880 --> 33:42.080
that it is people that enjoy Guy Fieri and not necessarily his cuisine

33:42.080 --> 33:43.760
that are coming back to lap these things up.

33:44.560 --> 33:47.840
In this new concept, Fieri has taken the chicken tender,

33:47.840 --> 33:52.480
endowed it with a proprietary blend of flavors.

33:52.480 --> 33:54.320
No, I endowed it.

33:54.320 --> 33:55.520
Endowed it?

33:55.520 --> 33:56.480
Bless it.

33:56.480 --> 33:58.480
He is not the Lord.

33:59.280 --> 34:04.880
And Fieri has looked down and blessed the chicken with some pepper, I guess.

34:05.440 --> 34:05.940
Probably.

34:05.940 --> 34:08.820
And then with God as my witness,

34:08.820 --> 34:10.420
the next line of this is,

34:10.420 --> 34:14.020
and provided guests with a myriad of delicious sauce options.

34:15.060 --> 34:17.300
Fucking, if you look at me, Guy,

34:17.940 --> 34:21.540
do you tell me about how many fucking sauces you have?

34:21.540 --> 34:24.500
One more time, I'm gonna peel open your tear ducts

34:24.500 --> 34:30.100
and I'm gonna pour your spicy double triple pickle habanero ranch right down them.

34:30.900 --> 34:35.300
I knew the good people of Miami love the real deal.

34:35.300 --> 34:41.860
Because some of my favorite diners, drive-ins, and dives joints are in the area, says Fieri.

34:41.860 --> 34:44.260
Um, that's a pretty good Guy Fieri.

34:44.900 --> 34:45.460
Thanks.

34:45.460 --> 34:47.380
I do wish he had said,

34:47.380 --> 34:50.740
I like that he felt the need to append joints.

34:50.740 --> 34:53.300
My diners, drive-ins, and dives joints,

34:53.300 --> 34:55.460
you could have just said anyway, Guy.

34:55.460 --> 35:00.340
So I couldn't be more stoked to bring them the chicken guy at Aventura Mall.

35:00.340 --> 35:01.620
Yeah, Aventura's in a mall.

35:01.620 --> 35:02.740
Ah, sick.

35:02.740 --> 35:03.060
Nice.

35:03.060 --> 35:03.700
Cool, bro.

35:03.700 --> 35:08.020
You know, real deal chicken tenders, 20 plus killer sauces.

35:08.020 --> 35:08.980
You motherfucker!

35:09.620 --> 35:10.820
I told you!

35:10.820 --> 35:11.620
I warned you, Guy!

35:11.620 --> 35:13.220
Get those ducts over here, Guy!

35:13.860 --> 35:16.260
20 plus killer sauces and a whole lot of fun.

35:17.300 --> 35:19.300
Welcome to Flavortown, Miami.

35:19.300 --> 35:19.800
All right.

35:20.340 --> 35:22.020
I love, uh, two things.

35:22.740 --> 35:25.140
I love many things in my life, but two things about this,

35:25.140 --> 35:29.780
which is, uh, that he believes that these folks in Miami who love the real deal,

35:29.780 --> 35:32.340
like someone might come visit perhaps and they'll go,

35:32.340 --> 35:34.340
oh yeah, there's this tiny joint over there,

35:34.340 --> 35:36.500
and oh, you can get this amazing sandwich over here.

35:36.500 --> 35:38.180
But if you want the real deal,

35:38.180 --> 35:39.140
the real shit,

35:39.140 --> 35:40.820
you're gonna keep this down.

35:40.820 --> 35:42.500
There's kind of a local secret.

35:42.500 --> 35:46.660
You're gonna head to Chicken Guy's, you know, surprising Meats Authentic.

35:48.100 --> 35:51.540
And we're so glad that Guy came here,

35:51.540 --> 35:56.820
because finally, finally, someone brought some flavor to Miami.

35:56.820 --> 35:58.180
Yeah, it's about time.

35:58.180 --> 36:00.340
Justin, does it mention anywhere in that press release

36:00.340 --> 36:02.660
if they offer any kind of sauces or anything?

36:02.660 --> 36:05.620
In this one, we don't know about sauce count, really.

36:05.620 --> 36:06.580
It's not specific.

36:07.220 --> 36:08.900
That's a glaring omission.

36:08.900 --> 36:10.500
It's a huge problem.

36:10.500 --> 36:14.580
Can we just round robin ranch barbecue honey mustard?

36:15.700 --> 36:17.460
That's only three.

36:17.460 --> 36:21.140
And that's pretty much the standard options, I feel.

36:21.140 --> 36:22.660
What about liquified chicken?

36:23.780 --> 36:25.140
Yeah, it's possible.

36:25.140 --> 36:26.020
It's possible.

36:26.020 --> 36:26.980
I like this chicken.

36:26.980 --> 36:29.860
I just want it to taste more like chicken.

36:29.860 --> 36:31.780
There's one more quote that I did want to share with you.

36:32.420 --> 36:36.900
And it's one of the most American quotes we've ever had on the show.

36:37.620 --> 36:41.620
I absolutely love working with Guy on Chicken Guy,

36:41.620 --> 36:44.740
and I can't wait to open at Aventura Mall,

36:44.740 --> 36:47.860
says Planet Hollywood founder and chairman Robert Earl.

36:47.860 --> 36:50.660
We've found the perfect venture with Chicken Guy,

36:50.660 --> 36:55.140
a proven crowd pleaser based on our first location at Disney Springs.

36:55.860 --> 36:58.660
I can't believe you would do this at Mickey's house.

36:58.660 --> 37:00.340
Let me do this.

37:00.340 --> 37:02.580
You would do this at Mickey's house?

37:02.580 --> 37:03.860
He lives there, dog.

37:03.860 --> 37:06.020
Just inches away from his bed?

37:06.020 --> 37:08.660
That's where Mickey lives and you do it at Mickey's house?

37:08.660 --> 37:10.580
That's where his dog stays.

37:10.580 --> 37:12.180
I think we had a listener at a live show

37:12.180 --> 37:14.660
say he had Guy Fieri feed him a chicken tender

37:14.660 --> 37:16.820
at this grand opening at Disney Springs.

37:16.820 --> 37:18.340
I didn't hear any complaints about the meat

37:18.340 --> 37:22.740
or the bevy of the, you know, the nearly two dozen sauces available.

37:22.740 --> 37:24.100
So maybe this is good chicken.

37:25.220 --> 37:26.900
Listen, I love a Tendo.

37:26.900 --> 37:30.180
Given the chance, I'll eat it.

37:30.180 --> 37:32.020
I know his nasty track record.

37:32.020 --> 37:33.780
I'll still eat his Tendos.

37:33.780 --> 37:34.820
I have a Yahoo here.

37:34.820 --> 37:38.020
This one was sent in by Brendan.

37:38.020 --> 37:38.820
Thanks, Brendan.

37:38.820 --> 37:39.780
You did a good job.

37:40.500 --> 37:41.780
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

37:42.900 --> 37:43.700
Whoa, that's weird.

37:44.340 --> 37:47.380
The box that usually has their name in it loads,

37:47.380 --> 37:49.220
but it doesn't have their name in it.

37:49.220 --> 37:50.180
It has nothing in it.

37:50.180 --> 37:51.780
It says 15% best answers,

37:51.780 --> 37:53.620
so that's actually maybe one of the highest I've seen.

37:53.620 --> 37:56.260
They have 52,365 Yahoo points,

37:56.260 --> 37:57.780
which has earned them the level of seven.

37:58.900 --> 38:01.700
And they've done 11,934 answers.

38:01.700 --> 38:04.020
This person is the chosen one, but I can't see their name.

38:05.140 --> 38:06.100
That's Yahoo for you.

38:06.100 --> 38:07.780
My user has no name.

38:07.780 --> 38:08.740
It might be Neo.

38:08.740 --> 38:10.820
So Neo asks,

38:11.940 --> 38:13.700
if you could create a potion,

38:14.420 --> 38:15.940
what type of potion would it be?

38:17.860 --> 38:19.540
Basically, what would you name it?

38:19.540 --> 38:20.820
And what effect would it have?

38:21.700 --> 38:24.740
That is, perhaps, and we had a lot on here.

38:24.740 --> 38:28.980
The most wide open question I've ever heard on Yahoo Answers.

38:28.980 --> 38:29.460
You know what?

38:29.460 --> 38:33.780
It's almost so general that it makes you worried

38:33.780 --> 38:35.940
you won't be able to do good jokes about it.

38:35.940 --> 38:37.780
It almost gets you to that point.

38:37.780 --> 38:39.940
I would like to make a potion

38:39.940 --> 38:42.500
that makes me think of funny potion jokes.

38:46.900 --> 38:48.180
Okay, Griffin, you picked it.

38:48.180 --> 38:51.460
You start us off with your best potion zinger.

38:52.020 --> 38:53.780
I wish there was a potion I could drink

38:53.780 --> 38:56.180
when I walk onto an airplane

38:56.180 --> 38:58.420
that would guarantee that I wouldn't have to use the bathroom

38:58.420 --> 38:59.780
at all until the plane lands.

38:59.780 --> 39:00.260
That's pretty good.

39:00.260 --> 39:01.460
Actually, no, sorry.

39:01.460 --> 39:03.700
Because then the genie's gonna catch me in a trick

39:03.700 --> 39:06.100
if I say it like that, because the plane's gonna land

39:06.100 --> 39:08.900
and then I'm gonna release myself while we're on the tarmac.

39:08.900 --> 39:10.420
Is it a potion or a genie?

39:11.380 --> 39:12.900
Is that a genie potion?

39:12.900 --> 39:15.220
If you pour water in a genie bottle and you drink it,

39:15.220 --> 39:15.860
what happens?

39:15.860 --> 39:17.860
No, it's a potion, but the potion bottle

39:17.860 --> 39:19.780
also just happens to have a genie in it.

39:19.780 --> 39:20.260
Oh, okay.

39:20.260 --> 39:23.460
So the plane lands and then once we taxi to the gate,

39:23.460 --> 39:25.700
and then get off, and I make it to the toilet,

39:25.700 --> 39:27.780
I sit down on it, then I can go.

39:27.780 --> 39:29.220
But not before that.

39:29.220 --> 39:31.620
I chug it as I'm crossing the threshold of the plane.

39:32.180 --> 39:34.900
And I say chug, I wouldn't want it to be a lot of fluid.

39:34.900 --> 39:35.700
I would want it to be a pretty small-

39:35.700 --> 39:36.660
Like a shot.

39:36.660 --> 39:38.980
Yeah, it was even smaller than that, a little vial.

39:38.980 --> 39:41.300
And I just drink that and then all the pee goes away,

39:41.300 --> 39:43.780
all poo goes away, and then it doesn't come back

39:43.780 --> 39:45.300
until I make it to Tallahassee.

39:46.260 --> 39:49.540
Which is my turn of phrase that I use.

39:50.900 --> 39:51.860
No, that's rude.

39:51.860 --> 39:52.900
I just went to Tallahassee.

39:52.900 --> 39:53.620
It was lovely.

39:53.620 --> 39:56.180
But that's my potion, and it's relevant

39:56.180 --> 39:59.300
because I just flew today and there was stuff.

39:59.300 --> 40:00.260
There was stuff that happened.

40:01.940 --> 40:02.500
Things happen.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.900
That's not a long flight, Ruben.

40:04.900 --> 40:05.380
Things happen.

40:05.380 --> 40:07.140
I know I've talked about this on the show before,

40:07.140 --> 40:09.700
and for some reason I was just like,

40:09.700 --> 40:12.580
on fire today up in the air.

40:12.580 --> 40:16.660
And I swear to God, I swear to God, this is not a joke.

40:17.380 --> 40:20.820
Diagonal from me, an older gentleman

40:20.820 --> 40:23.860
was watching the fucking second Eddie Redmayne movie,

40:23.860 --> 40:26.260
the second The Crimes of Grindelwald.

40:26.260 --> 40:27.380
And why?

40:28.100 --> 40:29.860
What are the freaking odds, man?

40:30.580 --> 40:33.460
Anyway, no pee-plane potion.

40:33.460 --> 40:33.960
Justin?

40:34.820 --> 40:37.300
I would do-

40:40.420 --> 40:41.780
Hold on, you're funny, Ruben.

40:41.780 --> 40:42.180
Okay.

40:42.740 --> 40:43.700
Well, give me a second.

40:43.700 --> 40:44.100
Hold on.

40:44.740 --> 40:45.620
Flight.

40:45.620 --> 40:46.260
Flight.

40:46.260 --> 40:46.660
Flight.

40:46.660 --> 40:51.620
Flight. Now, I do feel like that is maybe a little derivative

40:51.620 --> 40:54.100
of ribbons, because he talked about flying in here.

40:54.100 --> 40:55.620
I talked about flying in mine.

40:56.340 --> 40:57.060
Should we put-

40:57.060 --> 40:59.060
Wait, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

40:59.060 --> 40:59.540
Start over.

40:59.540 --> 41:00.420
Start the-

41:00.420 --> 41:01.220
Okay, okay.

41:01.220 --> 41:01.620
Start the-

41:01.620 --> 41:02.900
Oh, let me restart the clock.

41:02.900 --> 41:03.400
Okay.

41:04.820 --> 41:05.320
Strong.

41:06.740 --> 41:07.240
I see.

41:08.580 --> 41:08.900
Very-

41:08.900 --> 41:09.220
Strong.

41:09.780 --> 41:10.660
Very strong.

41:10.660 --> 41:12.020
Very strong.

41:12.020 --> 41:13.780
With- Let me choose.

41:13.780 --> 41:14.020
Okay.

41:14.020 --> 41:16.420
Very strong with the potion.

41:16.420 --> 41:16.980
Oh, okay.

41:18.500 --> 41:19.620
Thanks to the potion.

41:20.740 --> 41:21.700
So strong.

41:21.700 --> 41:23.780
So, wait, the potion makes you strong?

41:23.780 --> 41:24.820
Yeah, that's-

41:24.820 --> 41:25.320
Potion.

41:26.100 --> 41:27.460
Potion makes Justin strong.

41:27.460 --> 41:28.900
Potion makes Justin strong.

41:28.900 --> 41:30.900
What do you do with that strength once you get it?

41:30.900 --> 41:32.340
Like, what do you need the strong for?

41:34.500 --> 41:35.220
Lifting.

41:36.580 --> 41:38.420
Potion gives Justin strong lifting?

41:38.420 --> 41:39.220
Yeah, good.

41:39.220 --> 41:39.720
Good.

41:40.580 --> 41:41.620
Good at lifting.

41:41.620 --> 41:43.940
Good at lifting. Best at punch.

41:43.940 --> 41:44.440
Yeah.

41:44.980 --> 41:47.140
Okay, potion make Justin good lifter.

41:47.140 --> 41:48.260
Best puncher.

41:48.260 --> 41:50.660
And if there's a heavy push that needs-

41:50.660 --> 41:52.100
Yeah, like a big door.

41:52.100 --> 41:52.340
Yeah.

41:52.340 --> 41:52.980
If to push.

41:54.260 --> 41:54.740
For sure.

41:56.740 --> 41:57.860
Champion of push.

41:57.860 --> 41:59.060
And how long does it last?

42:01.620 --> 42:02.260
Hour.

42:02.260 --> 42:02.900
Hour.

42:02.900 --> 42:04.420
Yeah, you don't want it to be too long.

42:04.420 --> 42:05.460
Big push.

42:06.580 --> 42:07.700
Push champion.

42:07.700 --> 42:08.820
Best at punching.

42:08.820 --> 42:09.300
Yeah.

42:09.300 --> 42:10.340
To lift.

42:10.340 --> 42:10.900
For hour.

42:10.900 --> 42:11.780
For hour.

42:11.780 --> 42:12.740
Strong of potion.

42:12.740 --> 42:13.940
Good job, Justin.

42:13.940 --> 42:14.660
That's a good one.

42:16.020 --> 42:17.940
I would just like a potion that's cherry flavored.

42:18.500 --> 42:19.000
No.

42:19.780 --> 42:20.660
No, I'm not-

42:20.660 --> 42:21.300
No.

42:21.300 --> 42:24.580
No, I'm not gonna let you turn this into a fucking gag, Trav.

42:24.580 --> 42:25.060
Not this time.

42:25.060 --> 42:26.580
It's gonna give you cool powers.

42:27.300 --> 42:28.900
I would like a potion.

42:28.900 --> 42:29.140
Yeah.

42:29.140 --> 42:33.940
And when I drink it, it kind of impairs my judgment a little bit.

42:33.940 --> 42:34.580
Maybe it makes it a little bit relaxed.

42:34.580 --> 42:36.340
You're gonna do another freaking gag.

42:36.340 --> 42:37.940
I don't want the gag, Travis.

42:37.940 --> 42:41.140
I want a big, powerful brother that drink a big potion.

42:41.140 --> 42:42.020
Not powerful.

42:42.020 --> 42:42.660
Powerful is my-

42:42.660 --> 42:43.140
Powerful is Justin's.

42:43.140 --> 42:44.020
Justin gets strong.

42:44.020 --> 42:44.740
Yeah.

42:44.740 --> 42:45.700
I'd like a potion.

42:46.340 --> 42:47.300
Make me fast.

42:48.340 --> 42:48.980
All right.

42:50.020 --> 42:51.060
Now you're cooking.

42:51.060 --> 42:53.700
Now we're fucking talking about it, baby.

42:53.700 --> 42:54.200
And I-

42:54.900 --> 42:56.420
Oh, how fast?

42:56.420 --> 42:57.940
I would run and people would be like,

42:58.500 --> 42:59.000
damn.

42:59.700 --> 43:00.260
Yeah.

43:00.260 --> 43:00.740
Fast.

43:01.380 --> 43:05.380
But I wouldn't like to be so fast that it's like a big deal.

43:05.380 --> 43:06.100
Yeah.

43:06.100 --> 43:08.260
I would just like to be faster.

43:08.980 --> 43:09.700
Yeah.

43:09.700 --> 43:13.060
I feel like this is how it was in the Marvel writers room back in the 60s.

43:13.060 --> 43:15.300
And then Stan Lee was like, okay, start over.

43:15.300 --> 43:15.620
Hold on.

43:15.620 --> 43:16.340
Let's try this again.

43:16.340 --> 43:17.700
What about spiders?

43:17.700 --> 43:19.940
Is there anything there that we could do?

43:19.940 --> 43:20.980
Oh, that's a good point.

43:20.980 --> 43:22.580
Justin's Spider-Man potion is what I want.

43:22.580 --> 43:24.580
I didn't even think about fucking Spider-Man posting.

43:24.580 --> 43:25.060
Yeah.

43:25.060 --> 43:25.380
Sorry, yeah, guys.

43:25.380 --> 43:30.420
So like he did in the comics where he drank the potion that the magic man made in the forest.

43:30.420 --> 43:32.900
And then he was able to turn into a spider.

43:32.900 --> 43:34.340
I would like that potion as well.

43:34.340 --> 43:34.740
I would actually-

43:34.740 --> 43:35.220
You know what?

43:35.220 --> 43:39.060
I'd like 10 of that potion so that I can do it 10 times.

43:39.780 --> 43:40.900
I would like a potion-

43:41.460 --> 43:41.700
Yeah?

43:42.500 --> 43:43.940
That gives me money.

43:45.060 --> 43:50.340
Now, there's actually a Yahoo Answers user here who, well, they said they wanted a potion

43:50.340 --> 43:55.380
that would take me places wherever I go without worrying of needing an airplane, driving a

43:55.380 --> 44:00.420
vehicle, taking a bus, or heck, even riding a bicycle or tricycle to reach a certain destination.

44:01.060 --> 44:03.860
And then also a potion that would make me a millionaire.

44:03.860 --> 44:06.420
A potion that would make you a millionaire, huh?

44:06.420 --> 44:08.020
You would have to shit money.

44:08.020 --> 44:10.100
Yeah, you would have to turn into money in your guts.

44:10.740 --> 44:11.220
And you don't want that.

44:11.220 --> 44:14.500
That's the only thing, maybe piss money, but who wants to piss money?

44:14.500 --> 44:17.780
Oh, what if I drink that potion and the no pee potion?

44:17.780 --> 44:20.820
Oh no, you'd have a bunch of money in your tummy.

44:21.780 --> 44:22.260
Full up.

44:22.820 --> 44:27.060
I would like to have a potion that helps me understand the gastrointestinal process.

44:27.940 --> 44:31.460
I think a potion for many potions.

44:31.460 --> 44:31.780
Uh-huh.

44:31.780 --> 44:36.100
If you drink a potion and it gives you a thousand potions.

44:36.100 --> 44:39.060
But each one of those does the same thing.

44:39.940 --> 44:40.660
Oh, shit.

44:40.660 --> 44:42.660
Well, now you're going to have so many potions, Justin.

44:42.660 --> 44:46.020
You're going to have to drink a potion to have a whole house to keep your potions in.

44:46.020 --> 44:47.140
Enough potion for all.

44:47.700 --> 44:49.140
Oh, Justin, that's lovely.

44:50.180 --> 44:51.940
I'd like to buy the world a potion.

44:51.940 --> 44:52.180
Yeah.

44:54.020 --> 44:57.060
Why didn't they ever- why didn't they name it Coca-Cola?

44:57.060 --> 44:59.300
They could have just called it brown potion.

44:59.300 --> 45:00.980
Man, fuck, that'd be awesome.

45:00.980 --> 45:01.700
It's so good.

45:01.700 --> 45:03.540
Can I have diet brown potion?

45:03.540 --> 45:06.500
Can I have a drink where you just kind of mix all the potions together?

45:07.060 --> 45:08.260
Oh, that's fun.

45:08.260 --> 45:10.020
I can kind of not pee on an airplane.

45:11.220 --> 45:12.820
And also I'm a little strong.

45:12.820 --> 45:20.740
Folks, we come to you once every year and ask you to pay for all the great entertainment

45:20.740 --> 45:21.540
that you've given us.

45:22.740 --> 45:22.740
What?

45:24.500 --> 45:25.700
Yes, dance for us.

45:26.260 --> 45:28.820
No, I mean, we give you entertainment.

45:28.820 --> 45:29.540
God damn.

45:29.540 --> 45:31.220
No, keep going.

45:31.220 --> 45:31.860
Damn.

45:31.860 --> 45:36.660
We do our best over here at the studio and we just wanted to let you know that if you

45:36.660 --> 45:42.260
wanted to leave a few coins in the hat, as it were, as we finished our juggling show

45:42.260 --> 45:44.260
or our magic or street magic.

45:44.260 --> 45:45.860
I was doing a living statue.

45:46.660 --> 45:48.100
Travis is doing a living statue.

45:48.100 --> 45:50.100
We've all got our different talents that we're showing off here.

45:50.100 --> 45:51.940
I'm doing back- I do backflips.

45:51.940 --> 45:53.460
I can stand very still.

45:53.460 --> 46:02.740
It has allowed us to go all over the country and visit all of y'all and one by one, one

46:02.740 --> 46:06.420
by one and come to your house and eat your minestrone out your cupboard when you're

46:06.420 --> 46:07.380
not looking.

46:07.380 --> 46:08.900
And where did that minestrone go?

46:08.900 --> 46:09.460
We ate it.

46:09.460 --> 46:10.820
Thanks to your donations.

46:11.540 --> 46:12.020
Thank you.

46:12.660 --> 46:17.780
And we have always been so moved by your support and it means so much to us.

46:17.780 --> 46:26.820
And it really does help us to keep doing this show and to make the kind of- the thing we

46:26.820 --> 46:30.820
hear from people a lot of the time is I wish that there was more of this kind of stuff

46:30.820 --> 46:36.020
in the world because we try really hard to be nice and make nice stuff that will make

46:36.020 --> 46:41.140
people happy and feel good and not hurt people.

46:41.140 --> 46:46.340
And I think that when you donate to our show, and I think all the Max Fun shows share that

46:46.340 --> 46:51.060
ethos, I feel like when you donate to the network, it's your way of voting that like

46:51.060 --> 46:54.340
that is the kind of thing you would like to see more of.

46:54.980 --> 47:02.340
There's a lot of places that are super well funded with a lot of, I will say, corporate

47:03.140 --> 47:07.780
cash that are making entertainment that isn't really designed to make any one person extremely

47:07.780 --> 47:12.340
happy, just make everybody feel sort of okay.

47:12.340 --> 47:18.260
And it doesn't necessarily have making the world a slightly better place to be at the

47:18.260 --> 47:21.700
top of its priorities list.

47:21.700 --> 47:23.140
And that's really important to us.

47:23.140 --> 47:24.660
I would say the most important thing to us.

47:24.660 --> 47:29.380
And I feel like when you donate to us and the network, then that is your way of voting

47:29.380 --> 47:30.980
for that kind of entertainment.

47:30.980 --> 47:36.980
The gifts are great and we know that they're beautiful and cool to get and the promo material

47:36.980 --> 47:37.220
is great.

47:37.220 --> 47:42.740
But I think that maybe the best reward, I think, as a Max Fun donor is knowing that

47:42.740 --> 47:47.780
I am voting for the kind of entertainment I want to see more of in the world.

47:47.780 --> 47:52.900
And this is the time of year that you can do exactly that over at maximumfun.org forward

47:52.900 --> 47:53.700
slash donate.

47:53.700 --> 48:00.020
I will also say something that has impressed me over and over again and without fail is

48:00.020 --> 48:04.340
the Max Fun community as a whole is amazing.

48:04.340 --> 48:11.460
Like both our listeners and also the other hosts and the Max Fun staff and like everybody

48:11.460 --> 48:14.740
that works, we have a lot of fun all hanging out.

48:14.740 --> 48:19.060
We do meetups and Max Fun Con and all of this kind of stuff.

48:19.060 --> 48:20.660
And it's a blast.

48:20.660 --> 48:24.580
Everybody is very nice and fun and it's great.

48:24.580 --> 48:30.260
And speaking of, coming up on the Tuesday of the second week of Max Fun Drives, there's

48:30.260 --> 48:35.300
going to be meetups maybe everywhere in the world, depending on if you want to set those

48:35.300 --> 48:35.780
up.

48:35.780 --> 48:44.100
But go to maximumfun.org forward slash meetup, I believe, or it's maximumfun.org slash

48:44.100 --> 48:47.700
meetups2019 to see if there's one near you.

48:47.700 --> 48:53.060
We're putting together one here in Cincinnati that I will be visiting if you want to come

48:53.060 --> 48:54.100
and check that out.

48:54.100 --> 49:00.020
So we're going to finish talking about Max Fun Drive now, but go to maximumfun.org forward

49:00.020 --> 49:01.780
slash donate.

49:01.780 --> 49:06.660
You pick the shows you want to support and you get some cool gifts, get the bonus content,

49:06.660 --> 49:10.260
get the pin, get the mug, get whatever you feel comfortable with.

49:10.260 --> 49:14.580
If you can share the drive with your friends on social media, that means a lot.

49:14.580 --> 49:18.100
If you can think about upgrading, if you're already a donor and you've been tuning into

49:18.100 --> 49:20.180
more stuff, you know, just think about it.

49:20.180 --> 49:22.020
But do it now before you before you forget.

49:22.020 --> 49:24.420
It's maximumfun.org slash donate.

49:24.420 --> 49:30.340
And let us know if you want to tweet at us or tweet at McElroy family or just, you know,

49:30.340 --> 49:33.700
whatever tweet that you donated so we can say thank you.

49:33.700 --> 49:37.300
And now it's time for Farm Wisdom.

49:37.300 --> 49:40.340
Farm wisdom.

49:41.220 --> 49:42.180
Farm wisdom.

49:43.140 --> 49:44.980
Ain't no harm around this farm.

49:44.980 --> 49:45.940
Farm wisdom.

49:46.980 --> 49:47.940
Pretty good.

49:47.940 --> 49:51.940
Yeah, I guess it's a very ethical farm you're leading there.

49:51.940 --> 49:57.460
Um, here is some alpaca facts from Adrian.

49:57.460 --> 49:58.660
Thank you, Adrian.

49:58.660 --> 50:05.780
One, when male alpacas get randy, they make a sound called orgling, which sounds exactly

50:05.780 --> 50:07.220
like how you think it does.

50:07.220 --> 50:08.900
I don't, I don't think it, I don't know.

50:08.900 --> 50:12.420
I can't generate in my mind the sound that I think that means.

50:12.420 --> 50:16.900
They also don't ejaculate so much as dribble throughout the whole thing.

50:16.900 --> 50:20.260
So alpaca sex can take up to 45 minutes to finish.

50:20.260 --> 50:23.860
That's 43 minutes longer than anyone's ever had sex.

50:23.860 --> 50:25.860
Yeah, dribble, all dribbling, huh?

50:25.860 --> 50:28.500
That's, uh, I know that we all know that feel, right?

50:29.860 --> 50:30.100
Right?

50:30.660 --> 50:32.340
Here is the sound of orgling.

50:32.340 --> 50:33.380
I've prepared it for you.

50:33.380 --> 50:33.620
Oh, good.

50:38.580 --> 50:42.020
Oh yeah, nothing says let's have sex like that sound.

50:42.020 --> 50:49.220
It only goes on for another minute and 20 seconds.

50:49.220 --> 50:51.220
Oh my god.

50:54.660 --> 50:56.420
Hey, toss that on the soundboard.

50:56.420 --> 50:56.740
Yeah.

50:56.740 --> 51:00.260
Maximumfun.org forward slash donate.

51:01.460 --> 51:04.660
I also really like this fact because Adrian has written,

51:04.660 --> 51:07.860
alpacas have the cutest terms for the things they do.

51:07.860 --> 51:11.620
And I would argue, Adrian, that they are not the alpacas terms.

51:11.620 --> 51:12.500
But probably not.

51:13.140 --> 51:15.860
Justin, quit putting on your fucking-

51:15.860 --> 51:17.780
your horny alpaca soundcloud.

51:17.780 --> 51:18.420
Turn it off.

51:19.460 --> 51:20.500
I can't hear it anymore.

51:20.500 --> 51:20.980
Can you guys still hear it?

51:20.980 --> 51:22.660
Yes, yes, very much.

51:22.660 --> 51:24.580
I will always hear it forever.

51:24.580 --> 51:25.140
Oh, that's fun.

51:25.140 --> 51:27.380
I turned off my monitor so I can't hear it.

51:28.820 --> 51:30.500
But Adrian writes, when alpacas-

51:30.500 --> 51:33.060
when an alpaca sits down and tucks its leg underneath it,

51:33.060 --> 51:34.340
it's called cushing.

51:34.340 --> 51:37.620
When they bounce up and down in the field like Pepe Le Pew,

51:37.620 --> 51:38.580
it's called pronking.

51:38.580 --> 51:41.380
And when alpacas do decide to talk, they-

51:41.380 --> 51:42.180
Pronking.

51:42.180 --> 51:42.980
Pronking.

51:43.780 --> 51:44.820
That sounds like they should-

51:44.820 --> 51:47.780
all of those also sound like sex stuff that they could be doing.

51:47.780 --> 51:48.820
See, I was gonna say,

51:48.820 --> 51:51.540
pronking kind of sounds like a new show from Jamie Kennedy.

51:51.540 --> 51:52.020
Maybe.

51:52.020 --> 51:53.300
Like, oh man, I got pronked.

51:53.300 --> 51:56.420
I got pronked by JK, dang.

51:56.420 --> 51:58.100
I got pronked by that orglar.

51:58.900 --> 51:59.620
Stop, hold on.

52:00.260 --> 52:02.180
Is there still alpaca sex noises happening?

52:02.180 --> 52:03.940
Because I keep hearing stuff in the background.

52:03.940 --> 52:05.460
That doesn't seem possible.

52:05.460 --> 52:06.980
It's not on my end, I will say.

52:06.980 --> 52:10.500
That might just be a ghost in the machine.

52:10.500 --> 52:11.620
Oh shit, okay.

52:13.300 --> 52:15.220
Also, we have more farm wisdom here

52:15.220 --> 52:17.780
because it's the extra farm wisdom

52:17.780 --> 52:18.820
because it's Max Fun Drive.

52:19.540 --> 52:21.060
This is from AJ,

52:21.060 --> 52:23.700
and AJ says that they worked with cows as a teenager

52:23.700 --> 52:26.340
and the most effective way to milk several hundred cows

52:26.340 --> 52:29.540
is by using a giant rotating cow carousel

52:29.540 --> 52:32.260
called the rotolactor.

52:33.300 --> 52:36.020
The cows line themselves up and step on one by one

52:36.020 --> 52:37.780
on a giant rotating platform

52:37.780 --> 52:40.820
and then slowly spin around as they get milked.

52:40.820 --> 52:44.020
And when they're done, they're back at the gate

52:44.020 --> 52:46.660
and they can walk off so the next cow can get on.

52:46.660 --> 52:48.740
But sometimes the cows don't want to get off

52:48.740 --> 52:50.260
because it's super fun.

52:50.260 --> 52:52.020
And the farmer has to give them a little push

52:52.020 --> 52:54.500
to remind them to let another cow have their turn.

52:55.620 --> 52:57.140
That's so great.

52:57.140 --> 52:58.260
That's good, I like that.

52:58.820 --> 53:02.180
I wish it had maybe how public restrooms worked or something.

53:02.180 --> 53:04.020
Oh shit, yeah, that'd be amazing.

53:04.020 --> 53:06.100
That'd be so cool.

53:06.100 --> 53:07.940
Well, I feel smarter and more rural.

53:07.940 --> 53:08.820
Do we have another question?

53:08.820 --> 53:11.700
I feel like a cow on a rotolactor.

53:11.700 --> 53:12.980
That's the thing I'm gonna start saying

53:12.980 --> 53:14.820
when I'm having a really great time.

53:14.820 --> 53:15.700
Here's a question.

53:15.700 --> 53:18.100
I recently purchased my first home, congratulations.

53:18.980 --> 53:20.500
However, it is an antique house

53:20.500 --> 53:23.380
with older toilets and thin walls.

53:23.380 --> 53:25.940
This all adds up to a very, very loud echo

53:25.940 --> 53:27.300
whenever anyone pees.

53:27.300 --> 53:28.660
I'm considering putting up a sign

53:28.660 --> 53:29.780
that says pee however you like.

53:31.140 --> 53:33.620
But if you pee standing up straight into the bowl,

53:33.620 --> 53:34.420
you will be heard.

53:35.380 --> 53:36.100
Thoughts?

53:36.100 --> 53:38.100
That's from a little too loud in Alabama.

53:38.100 --> 53:39.220
Who's still doing this?

53:39.220 --> 53:44.660
I think that you will be heard is oddly threatening.

53:44.660 --> 53:46.100
You will be heard.

53:46.100 --> 53:47.940
We will know that the peeing is happening.

53:49.220 --> 53:51.540
Who still pees straight into the bowl?

53:51.540 --> 53:52.660
Who's still doing this?

53:52.660 --> 53:54.900
Who's blasting off into the water

53:54.900 --> 53:57.940
and not aiming for the side of the porcelain?

53:59.380 --> 54:00.660
No one wants to hear that shit.

54:00.660 --> 54:06.580
I will also say, so we have potty trained BB,

54:06.580 --> 54:09.460
but part of the process was like bring your kid in

54:09.460 --> 54:10.980
so you could potty and make it see,

54:10.980 --> 54:12.020
I guess how rad it is.

54:12.980 --> 54:15.540
So I would sit down to pee and man,

54:15.540 --> 54:16.660
I'm never going back.

54:17.300 --> 54:19.140
Like I love sitting down to pee.

54:19.140 --> 54:20.100
It's so comfortable.

54:20.100 --> 54:21.860
Why wouldn't I give myself?

54:21.860 --> 54:23.540
Hey, you've been working hard.

54:23.540 --> 54:24.500
You work hard.

54:24.500 --> 54:25.780
You play hard.

54:25.780 --> 54:26.580
Sit down to pee.

54:27.220 --> 54:28.340
Travis McElroy.

54:28.340 --> 54:29.380
Take a load off, brother.

54:29.380 --> 54:31.140
Take a load off, Annie.

54:31.140 --> 54:31.940
Sit down to pee.

54:33.060 --> 54:35.620
I feel like sitting down to pee,

54:35.620 --> 54:37.300
I'd lose myself in a book.

54:37.300 --> 54:38.100
Oh yeah.

54:38.100 --> 54:40.260
Sometimes I just fall asleep on there.

54:40.260 --> 54:41.700
Is that so bad though?

54:42.580 --> 54:44.260
Nah, but I got a lot of things to do.

54:44.260 --> 54:45.620
You could do them on the toilet.

54:45.620 --> 54:47.300
Nah, that's just your mind talking, baby.

54:47.300 --> 54:50.340
You gotta sit down on that toilet and let it go

54:50.340 --> 54:52.020
and then dive on into a...

54:52.020 --> 54:53.940
I have a little portable DVD player

54:53.940 --> 54:56.180
I keep in every bathroom in my house

54:56.180 --> 55:01.540
and sometimes I'll sit down to do a number one

55:01.540 --> 55:05.540
and put a film on in the DVD collections

55:05.540 --> 55:07.140
I keep in every bathroom in my house.

55:07.140 --> 55:10.100
Yeah, I've hidden DVD players in bathrooms

55:10.100 --> 55:12.100
all over this country as we've toured.

55:12.100 --> 55:13.540
It's good to have those dead drops.

55:13.540 --> 55:16.900
I remember, yeah, we did a show in Phoenix, I believe,

55:16.900 --> 55:19.380
and I left a dead drop there with a bug's life in it.

55:19.380 --> 55:21.780
So I took a pee and I watched most of a bug's life.

55:21.780 --> 55:23.860
That's why I keep going back to Boston.

55:23.860 --> 55:26.580
I've just been trying to finish the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

55:26.580 --> 55:27.080
Yeah.

55:27.700 --> 55:31.380
I gotta find out what happens to them hobbits in that ring.

55:31.380 --> 55:31.880
Yep.

55:32.340 --> 55:33.540
It all works out in the end.

55:33.540 --> 55:34.340
Spoilies!

55:34.340 --> 55:34.900
Spoilies!

55:35.700 --> 55:36.200
Sorry, bud.

55:37.700 --> 55:38.900
Do they get to Mordor?

55:41.380 --> 55:43.300
Yeah, but it turns out to be a letdown

55:43.860 --> 55:46.500
and it turns out that the real Mordor always the friends of you.

55:48.340 --> 55:51.380
I would just tell people, so what?

55:51.380 --> 55:53.060
Like, yeah, we all pee.

55:53.060 --> 55:53.940
So what?

55:53.940 --> 55:54.740
It doesn't matter.

55:54.740 --> 55:55.940
What's embarrassing about that?

55:55.940 --> 55:56.740
I'm peeing.

55:56.740 --> 55:57.540
I'm loving it.

55:57.540 --> 55:58.500
I'm living life.

55:58.900 --> 56:00.980
I've got a thick, ropey brain of fury.

56:00.980 --> 56:04.420
Like, just let me do my thing.

56:04.420 --> 56:06.980
Well, it's very, very loud.

56:06.980 --> 56:08.420
It's just so loud.

56:08.420 --> 56:11.860
I get that, but also, like, I very, very don't care.

56:11.860 --> 56:13.060
I'm almost four years old.

56:13.060 --> 56:14.100
Like, I'm glad I'm peeing.

56:14.100 --> 56:15.140
I'm glad I'm here to pee.

56:15.140 --> 56:18.740
That makes me so happy that I'm functioning and all is well.

56:18.740 --> 56:19.940
And I'm just peeing.

56:19.940 --> 56:21.860
I'm just peeing, hey, you know what?

56:21.860 --> 56:23.540
Why don't you do something more fun?

56:24.260 --> 56:27.060
Why are you so bored that you're listening to people pee?

56:27.060 --> 56:29.060
Maybe get an audio book or something.

56:29.060 --> 56:30.420
Watch an episode of Frasier.

56:32.180 --> 56:33.940
Go revisit Fringe.

56:33.940 --> 56:34.820
It holds up.

56:35.620 --> 56:36.020
Does it?

56:36.020 --> 56:37.700
I've never made it past the first season.

56:38.500 --> 56:41.140
Yeah, Trav, it's real good.

56:41.140 --> 56:44.820
Sydney's been rewatching it and I've been rewatching the end of episodes.

56:44.820 --> 56:47.220
Sometimes I come in the room and it holds up.

56:47.220 --> 56:50.020
How about you tell your friends, but you say it in a way of like,

56:50.020 --> 56:52.740
when they come back, you're like, hey, that sounded really healthy.

56:53.300 --> 56:53.700
Yeah.

56:53.700 --> 56:54.500
Good for you.

56:54.500 --> 56:55.700
I'm proud of you.

56:55.700 --> 56:57.860
And then when all your friends come over, they're like,

56:57.860 --> 57:00.340
oh, I love peeing at their house.

57:00.340 --> 57:03.140
Like, I get told what a good job I'm doing.

57:03.140 --> 57:05.060
Sometimes when I would take Bibi,

57:05.060 --> 57:08.500
where Bibi would, I would potty and then Bibi would clap for me.

57:08.500 --> 57:11.220
And I never knew how much I wanted that.

57:11.220 --> 57:12.900
You needed that approbation for sure.

57:12.900 --> 57:14.180
Fucking amazing.

57:14.180 --> 57:16.340
I kind of wish my friends would do that for me.

57:16.340 --> 57:16.980
Okay.

57:16.980 --> 57:21.140
If you put up a sign, you're going to make the person very paranoid

57:21.140 --> 57:22.340
about how loud that they piss.

57:22.900 --> 57:24.340
That's not great.

57:24.340 --> 57:27.540
If you don't put up a sign, the person will pee very loud.

57:27.540 --> 57:30.900
It will make a loud noise and other people will hear it.

57:31.540 --> 57:34.980
But speaking from my experience as a 38 years as a human being,

57:34.980 --> 57:36.980
when that person returns downstairs,

57:36.980 --> 57:40.500
none of the gathered humans will take it upon themselves and say,

57:40.500 --> 57:41.780
ha ha, heard you piss.

57:41.780 --> 57:42.420
Yeah.

57:42.420 --> 57:42.920
True.

57:43.540 --> 57:44.020
Not going to happen.

57:44.020 --> 57:47.540
Unless, unless, unless.

57:47.540 --> 57:49.460
Well, if you go out of your way to kind of turn your house

57:49.460 --> 57:54.260
into a sort of piss venue where the natural acoustics have a,

57:54.260 --> 57:57.860
it's like your house becomes the Red Rocks Amphitheater for piss.

57:57.860 --> 57:59.140
This is what I'm saying.

57:59.140 --> 58:00.660
Make it a celebration.

58:00.660 --> 58:02.340
A friend comes in and you're like,

58:02.340 --> 58:04.660
ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage.

58:04.660 --> 58:07.540
Brian, let's see what kind of thick ropey braids he's.

58:08.980 --> 58:10.420
We can't anymore.

58:10.420 --> 58:12.500
Bring into the porcelain stage.

58:12.500 --> 58:15.220
He'll let it rip, right, right.

58:15.220 --> 58:17.940
And then at the end of the year, maybe do like an award ceremony.

58:17.940 --> 58:18.740
Mm hmm.

58:18.740 --> 58:19.220
Love that.

58:19.220 --> 58:19.700
Yeah.

58:19.700 --> 58:20.260
Sure.

58:20.260 --> 58:20.660
I love that.

58:20.660 --> 58:22.100
Call your house yearning town.

58:22.100 --> 58:22.980
No, that's a musical.

58:22.980 --> 58:24.260
Oh, fuck, you're right.

58:24.260 --> 58:27.460
Folks, thank you so much for listening to our program.

58:27.460 --> 58:28.980
We hope you have enjoyed yourself.

58:29.540 --> 58:33.300
We, again, I'm not going to give you the hard press,

58:33.300 --> 58:35.220
but if you can find it in a few minutes,

58:35.220 --> 58:37.620
go to maximumfun.org forward slash donate

58:37.620 --> 58:41.220
and commit to a few bucks every month,

58:41.220 --> 58:44.020
that would really help us out a lot.

58:44.020 --> 58:47.940
And it really means a lot that you all have done that for us

58:47.940 --> 58:48.660
throughout the years.

58:48.660 --> 58:52.340
And if you would make this year the same thing again,

58:52.340 --> 58:53.220
that would just be the top.

58:53.220 --> 58:53.940
That'd be cool.

58:53.940 --> 58:55.860
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

58:55.860 --> 58:57.540
for these for a theme song, It's a Departure,

58:57.540 --> 58:59.060
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

58:59.940 --> 59:01.220
It's a fantastic album.

59:01.220 --> 59:04.260
And we are honored to have it as our theme song.

59:05.780 --> 59:08.900
And yeah, we've talked about maximumfun.org a lot already.

59:08.900 --> 59:10.340
Our website's mcroy.fan.

59:10.340 --> 59:11.460
We got new stuff on there.

59:11.460 --> 59:14.260
We got, I was going to say a new monster factor,

59:14.260 --> 59:15.860
but by the time this episode comes out,

59:15.860 --> 59:16.980
it will actually be quite old.

59:17.780 --> 59:19.940
We do have merch up there, which you can find.

59:19.940 --> 59:24.260
And also you can still get tickets to our San Jose

59:24.260 --> 59:25.380
and Salt Lake City shows.

59:25.380 --> 59:29.140
And we should be announcing more dates soon.

59:29.140 --> 59:30.260
So keep an eye on that.

59:30.260 --> 59:32.500
And on our Twitter account, at mcroyfamily,

59:33.700 --> 59:34.980
and we'll announce it there as well.

59:35.700 --> 59:37.060
Y'all want the final Yahoo?

59:37.620 --> 59:38.820
Yes, yes.

59:38.820 --> 59:41.140
A bunch of people sent this one in, thanks everybody.

59:41.140 --> 59:42.420
It's from Yahoo Answers user.

59:42.420 --> 59:43.780
They're anonymous, so I'm going to call them.

59:45.300 --> 59:50.500
Beppo asks, how many calories are there in soap?

59:53.860 --> 59:54.900
My name is Justin McElroy.

59:54.900 --> 59:56.340
I'm Travis McElroy.

59:56.340 --> 59:57.620
I'm Griffin McElroy.

59:57.620 --> 59:58.820
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

59:58.820 --> 59:59.540
Kiss your dad.

59:59.540 --> 01:00:13.060
Squat on the lips.
