00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.160
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:48.160 --> 00:53.520
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:53.520 --> 00:57.600
I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30 Griffin McElroy.

00:57.600 --> 01:03.360
Listen, I know it's early. It just turned October. It just, oh, tick tick tick,

01:03.360 --> 01:08.560
just rolled over into October, but I know what next year's theme is going to be.

01:08.560 --> 01:11.360
Oh, Jesus Christ. At what point do we...

01:12.240 --> 01:18.480
I haven't collaborated with like even anybody this year, not even one time a little bit.

01:18.480 --> 01:20.800
You've worked with us on several things.

01:20.800 --> 01:25.520
That doesn't fucking count anymore. We are the same thing at this point.

01:25.520 --> 01:30.560
We haven't reached across the boundaries to other people to create new art in you

01:31.760 --> 01:35.040
with the umlaut over it art, and we haven't collaborated.

01:35.040 --> 01:37.120
Let's stop fucking kidding ourselves.

01:37.680 --> 01:38.880
I collaborated once.

01:39.680 --> 01:40.960
With whom? On what?

01:41.520 --> 01:42.560
My friend Jerry.

01:43.440 --> 01:44.080
On what?

01:44.640 --> 01:45.280
Sandwich.

01:46.160 --> 01:49.840
You made a sandwich with your friend Jerry. I do actually remember that.

01:49.840 --> 01:51.280
Yeah, it was a sandwich.

01:51.280 --> 01:53.840
It was a good one. You shared a little piece of it.

01:53.840 --> 01:57.680
You mailed me a little finger of it, and you mailed Justin a finger of it,

01:57.680 --> 01:59.280
and we had a great meal together over it.

01:59.280 --> 02:01.760
Well, I had a piece of bread with some peanut butter on it,

02:01.760 --> 02:04.000
and Jerry had a piece of bread with some jelly on it,

02:04.000 --> 02:06.960
and we kind of high-fived in midair with a piece of bread.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.480
It was good. It was a friendship sandwich.

02:08.480 --> 02:10.640
And we called it a Travis and Jerry sandwich,

02:10.640 --> 02:14.480
and then you can find it at most grocery stores called Uncrustables.

02:15.520 --> 02:22.400
But here's the thing. In the past, our themes have been something that we are telling

02:22.400 --> 02:24.080
everyone in our audience to do, right?

02:24.080 --> 02:27.760
They are general messages of, like, guidance for the year.

02:27.760 --> 02:31.120
I've got something a little different in mind for 2019.

02:31.120 --> 02:34.320
This is very specific for my brother, my brother, and me,

02:34.320 --> 02:36.880
and it's going to change our show forever.

02:36.880 --> 02:37.600
Are you ready?

02:39.440 --> 02:40.320
I guess so.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.720
Like, I have plans, like, later today,

02:42.720 --> 02:45.920
and so I'm not sure I'm in the, like, right space to get my life changed.

02:45.920 --> 02:46.480
Okay.

02:46.480 --> 02:47.040
Can I-

02:47.040 --> 02:48.000
Are you ready?

02:48.000 --> 02:49.200
Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:49.200 --> 02:50.080
Sidebar with juice.

02:50.080 --> 02:51.360
What? Juice?

02:51.360 --> 02:54.000
Yeah. What are we going to do if it's shitty?

02:54.000 --> 02:54.560
The theme?

02:55.200 --> 02:56.880
Yeah, what if we do if it's shitty?

02:56.880 --> 02:59.040
Because you're talking about it like it's so good.

02:59.040 --> 03:02.320
I didn't approve talking about this right now.

03:02.320 --> 03:04.480
Like, this is breaking my heart right now.

03:04.480 --> 03:05.680
I don't know, what am I-

03:06.400 --> 03:07.840
Like, it's so early.

03:07.840 --> 03:08.560
It's so early.

03:08.560 --> 03:09.840
Are you ready?

03:09.840 --> 03:12.560
Okay, 20 equine teen.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.000
This year, we buy a horse.

03:18.080 --> 03:18.800
I love it.

03:18.800 --> 03:22.960
You got to hear the rest of the idea too.

03:22.960 --> 03:26.880
Yes, Ann has a cousin named I love it butt.

03:26.880 --> 03:32.720
We buy the horse, and we set up a 24-7 webcam on the horse

03:32.720 --> 03:36.000
so that people can go and look at the horse whenever they want to.

03:37.120 --> 03:39.760
All right, seven issues.

03:41.440 --> 03:41.920
One.

03:41.920 --> 03:43.040
Wow, seven issues.

03:43.040 --> 03:43.680
Okay, let's go.

03:43.680 --> 03:47.040
Yeah, it took me less than seven seconds to generate them.

03:47.040 --> 03:51.120
So I'm talking about more than one issue per sec.

03:51.120 --> 03:54.160
But if we have a 24-7 webcam up on the horse,

03:55.120 --> 03:58.480
people are going to see how bad we are at taking care of this fucking horse.

03:58.480 --> 03:59.680
Are you kidding me?

03:59.680 --> 04:03.840
We will keep it somewhere where there are people competent to take care of the horse.

04:03.840 --> 04:04.720
That don't matter.

04:04.720 --> 04:05.280
That don't matter.

04:05.280 --> 04:05.680
That don't matter.

04:05.680 --> 04:10.640
People are going to be watching these feeds for little glimpses of our glory

04:10.640 --> 04:12.960
as we walk in and we're like, let's pet the horse.

04:12.960 --> 04:13.680
Let's ride the horse.

04:13.680 --> 04:14.400
Let's love the horse.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.240
Let's nourish the horse with our love.

04:16.240 --> 04:19.440
And then they're not going to see that because I won't and you fucking won't.

04:19.440 --> 04:21.680
And Justin certainly won't.

04:21.680 --> 04:22.320
I might.

04:22.320 --> 04:23.040
I might.

04:23.040 --> 04:23.680
You won't.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.720
You wicked won't.

04:24.720 --> 04:25.680
If it's nearby.

04:27.120 --> 04:30.560
Number two, horses are very, very wildly profoundly expensive.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.880
They say that the day you buy a horse is the happiest day of your life.

04:34.880 --> 04:36.320
And that's it.

04:36.320 --> 04:37.040
That's all they say.

04:37.600 --> 04:41.760
Because it is a happy thing, but it doesn't change the fact that it's profoundly expensive,

04:41.760 --> 04:42.240
Travie.

04:42.240 --> 04:46.480
I don't, I feel like there's a real, I've gotten smarter.

04:47.280 --> 04:50.320
When you're growing up, you think it's funny to joke about everything.

04:50.960 --> 04:51.680
Everything is a joke.

04:53.120 --> 04:56.720
As I've gotten older, I've learned, especially on this show, not everything's funny

04:56.720 --> 04:59.600
because we've joked about things sometimes and they happen.

05:00.160 --> 05:04.640
And sometimes they happen in like, I wanted it to happen.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.000
So it did Matilda way.

05:06.720 --> 05:10.480
And some of them happen in like, we try to make this happen without really thinking about

05:10.480 --> 05:12.320
the repercussions of it way.

05:12.320 --> 05:18.320
And this seems to be one of those situations where I feel like we could, like someone could

05:18.320 --> 05:19.760
just show up with a horse.

05:19.760 --> 05:23.520
That's, that's my worry is that the people will say, well, these guys are never going

05:23.520 --> 05:24.640
to do this on their own.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.320
I'm going to just get them a horse.

05:26.320 --> 05:27.360
Oh, I see.

05:27.360 --> 05:31.200
You said that's your worry, but that was my hoping outcome.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.680
I was hoping that someone would buy a horse.

05:33.680 --> 05:34.180
Yeah.

05:35.680 --> 05:37.840
I want to buy the horse because I want to own it.

05:37.840 --> 05:43.120
I don't want a charity horse because a charity horse says, I don't, I can't have this.

05:43.120 --> 05:48.080
I gotta tell you, Trav, just to get a taste of this, I did just go on Craigslist to search

05:48.080 --> 05:53.280
for horses in your area or in my area or what's up in my area.

05:55.360 --> 05:59.200
There are some busted ass steeds up on this service, Trav.

05:59.200 --> 06:03.360
And I know every horse is a treasure from God's blessings, but oh my God, there are

06:03.360 --> 06:11.200
some steeds on here, Trav, that we would not want to be sort of seen with, let alone the

06:11.840 --> 06:12.960
legal owners of.

06:12.960 --> 06:14.080
There are some busted-

06:14.080 --> 06:16.720
That's what people said about Seabiscuit, Griffin.

06:16.720 --> 06:17.440
No, Trav.

06:18.640 --> 06:24.880
Yeah, Seabiscuit is a tall glass of water compared to some of these busted, gelding,

06:25.520 --> 06:27.600
gentle for the family steeds.

06:27.600 --> 06:28.560
That's what this one says.

06:28.560 --> 06:30.880
Appaloosa gelding gentle for the family.

06:30.880 --> 06:33.920
Not my fucking family, it looks awful.

06:33.920 --> 06:35.120
Oh my God.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.320
How pretty does your horse need to be then, Griffin?

06:39.360 --> 06:40.240
Better than this.

06:40.240 --> 06:41.520
At least better than this.

06:41.520 --> 06:43.920
This is a good sort of metric.

06:43.920 --> 06:49.600
Here is how incapable we are to own a horse.

06:49.600 --> 06:53.520
And I'm gonna just, this is a quiz that I don't know the answer to, but I'm gonna hit

06:53.520 --> 06:54.160
you, Travis.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.080
This is a quarter horse.

06:56.080 --> 06:59.600
It's a listing in my region of Huntington West, Virginia.

06:59.600 --> 07:04.640
This is a nice two-year-old grade quarter horse, standing 13.3 HH.

07:06.720 --> 07:07.200
What's that mean?

07:07.760 --> 07:08.560
Hands high.

07:09.600 --> 07:10.320
Hands high.

07:10.320 --> 07:10.880
Okay, fair.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.640
I think it's horse height.

07:15.520 --> 07:20.400
HH stands for horse height, and it's a special, it's like stone, you know how they say stone

07:20.400 --> 07:21.280
across the pond?

07:22.640 --> 07:26.160
A horse height is just like a new unit for horses' heights.

07:26.720 --> 07:28.560
This is easy go, okay.

07:28.560 --> 07:31.200
Simple to catch, in your pocket kind of horse.

07:35.680 --> 07:37.760
Easy going, stands tied.

07:38.560 --> 07:41.360
Trav, easy going, stands tied.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.120
You can tie it up, it'll just hang out.

07:43.840 --> 07:47.520
Picks up all four hooves and has a nice solid WTC.

07:49.040 --> 07:51.040
Walk, trot, canter.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.160
Oh, that's good.

07:52.160 --> 07:53.680
Okay, I'll give that to you.

07:53.680 --> 07:59.840
Been ponied on several different occasions.

07:59.840 --> 08:03.680
I think it means it got drunk on pony wine.

08:03.680 --> 08:04.880
No silly business to him.

08:05.520 --> 08:09.360
Has never offered to buck, bite, kick, or rear.

08:09.360 --> 08:10.160
Do they offer?

08:10.960 --> 08:17.280
Hi, I don't mind if you'd like to buck or bite or kick or rear.

08:17.840 --> 08:20.400
Can be stalled or turned out on pasture.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.680
Does great either way.

08:21.680 --> 08:23.760
Ready to be started your way.

08:23.760 --> 08:24.880
I love it, right?

08:24.880 --> 08:26.480
I can see this guy going any direction.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.800
He's a nice horse to work with and a pleasure to be around.

08:29.440 --> 08:32.480
Asking 700 OBO.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.080
Or best offer.

08:34.720 --> 08:36.800
$700 is not very much for a horse.

08:36.800 --> 08:38.160
Here's what I want to say though.

08:38.160 --> 08:40.880
On Craigslist, the listing does say $1.

08:41.840 --> 08:43.680
So maybe you're lying.

08:43.680 --> 08:45.840
Maybe you're a liar and I can't really trust anything

08:45.840 --> 08:46.880
you say about your horse.

08:46.880 --> 08:51.120
Now, I found a mini horse slash pony nearby Cincinnati.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.560
A real little Sebastian type.

08:54.560 --> 08:56.560
And it says here, no kick or bite.

08:57.520 --> 09:00.560
So that's $200 over offer.

09:00.560 --> 09:02.320
I do want it to offer it.

09:02.320 --> 09:03.600
Because sometimes I do.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.440
The only time I've ever ridden a horse

09:05.440 --> 09:07.520
is on our old youth minister's farm.

09:07.520 --> 09:10.720
And I was going bareback, no saddle on that bad boy.

09:10.720 --> 09:13.120
And it looked back at me and it said,

09:13.120 --> 09:16.080
hey, I'd like to buck you off and hurt your wiener very badly.

09:16.080 --> 09:19.600
And I said, I would not like that.

09:19.600 --> 09:20.320
Oh, you're doing it.

09:20.320 --> 09:20.880
You did it.

09:20.880 --> 09:21.360
It's done.

09:21.920 --> 09:22.560
It's been done.

09:23.120 --> 09:23.520
Thank you.

09:23.520 --> 09:23.840
Thank you.

09:23.840 --> 09:26.240
Let's learn about Jesus now.

09:26.240 --> 09:27.120
The horse said this?

09:28.160 --> 09:28.400
No.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.440
So yeah, Trav, this is-

09:31.440 --> 09:32.480
I'm going to work on it.

09:32.480 --> 09:33.280
I'm going to work on it.

09:33.280 --> 09:34.240
Yeah, it's a non-starter.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.120
I'm going to work on it.

09:35.120 --> 09:38.320
I'm going to manifest it with my energy

09:38.320 --> 09:39.360
and I'm going to make it happen.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.360
Juice, how about that first question?

09:42.320 --> 09:44.640
Yeah, so this is an advice show.

09:44.640 --> 09:46.800
My advice to you is probably don't buy a horse.

09:46.800 --> 09:50.080
Unless you know what you're doing and you don't.

09:50.080 --> 09:50.480
You don't.

09:50.480 --> 09:52.080
You can learn on the spot.

09:52.080 --> 09:55.600
You don't start driving after you learn to drive.

09:55.600 --> 09:59.280
You can't buy a My First Horse at Burner Horse

09:59.280 --> 10:01.600
and then learn how to not let them die.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.680
What if I got a super old horse?

10:03.680 --> 10:05.040
Nah, it's got you there.

10:05.920 --> 10:09.040
They're harder and they're more racist.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.520
So that's not even the kind of horse vibe

10:11.520 --> 10:12.640
you want around your home.

10:12.640 --> 10:16.400
You want a young, open-minded horse that will offer to bite

10:16.400 --> 10:18.560
but not so much that it gets weird.

10:18.560 --> 10:22.560
Yeah, it'll make it seem like it wants to know

10:22.560 --> 10:24.080
if you want it to bite you

10:24.080 --> 10:26.400
rather than making it clear that it wants to bite you.

10:26.400 --> 10:27.360
I would hate to bite you.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.280
My boyfriend recently revealed to me

10:29.280 --> 10:31.680
that he's allergic to beans and has never eaten them.

10:33.280 --> 10:35.360
I don't know what accent that was that you said

10:35.360 --> 10:36.480
the word beans with.

10:36.480 --> 10:38.240
That's why I always say beans.

10:38.240 --> 10:41.280
I always say beans.

10:41.280 --> 10:42.720
My boyfriend recently revealed to me

10:42.720 --> 10:45.360
he's allergic to beans and has never eaten them.

10:45.360 --> 10:47.760
While researching bean free chili recipes,

10:47.760 --> 10:49.760
he quietly but seriously asked me,

10:49.760 --> 10:51.440
what do beans taste like?

10:53.280 --> 10:55.520
Brothers, I've tried but I don't have the words

10:55.520 --> 10:57.440
that I hope and somewhat fear you do.

10:57.440 --> 11:00.320
How can I describe what a bean tastes like

11:00.320 --> 11:02.400
to someone who's never had them?

11:02.400 --> 11:04.960
And that's from Beanful Thinker in Oregon.

11:04.960 --> 11:09.280
I can tell you mouthfeel.

11:09.280 --> 11:10.960
What's a mouthfeel of a bean?

11:11.920 --> 11:16.000
Mouthfeel of a bean is a little bit like mushed up,

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
like sand, a little dirt in there.

11:21.600 --> 11:22.160
Gritty.

11:22.160 --> 11:23.520
Oh, beans.

11:23.520 --> 11:24.800
Oh, the beans are gritty.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.840
Yeah, I think the best way I could describe

11:27.840 --> 11:31.280
the mouthfeel of a bean is simply to say

11:31.280 --> 11:36.080
never as creamy as you want.

11:36.080 --> 11:38.080
You expect it to be a certain amount of creaminess

11:38.080 --> 11:40.000
but it's not gonna get you there.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.240
And I always want a little pop to my bean

11:42.240 --> 11:43.120
but it more just like.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.400
It gives up, it gives up, it goes to me.

11:46.400 --> 11:49.280
You know how they say small potatoes?

11:49.280 --> 11:52.720
I think a bean is kind of like a small soft potato

11:52.720 --> 11:53.600
in terms of like.

11:53.600 --> 11:56.720
A small soft potato I think is very good.

11:56.720 --> 11:59.440
Yeah, now we are kind of limiting this

11:59.440 --> 12:01.440
because I think we're thinking of your standard

12:02.400 --> 12:04.960
black bean, red bean, kidney bean kind of deal.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.720
But this could also be like green beans.

12:08.400 --> 12:08.960
You're right, Trav.

12:09.760 --> 12:10.720
Let's codify this.

12:10.720 --> 12:14.640
All beans taste the same, save for green beans

12:14.640 --> 12:18.160
which are beans that you eat inside their house

12:18.160 --> 12:22.320
and lima beans which I have been trying to get

12:22.320 --> 12:24.640
the Food and Drug Administration to classify

12:24.640 --> 12:26.800
as poison for my entire life.

12:26.800 --> 12:27.680
Yes.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.600
They are yucky.

12:29.600 --> 12:32.640
I would happily put the Mr. Yuck sticker

12:32.640 --> 12:33.600
on all these lima beans.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.120
They are the fucking worst.

12:35.120 --> 12:40.640
You know, lima beans technically are poison

12:40.640 --> 12:43.600
if you consume enough of them that contain a chemical

12:43.600 --> 12:46.160
that causes your body to create cyanide.

12:46.160 --> 12:46.880
Oh, yeah.

12:46.880 --> 12:48.160
It's like apple seeds.

12:48.160 --> 12:50.080
It's because they're so fucking gross

12:50.080 --> 12:53.040
that your body's like I would actually rather be dead

12:53.040 --> 12:55.440
than continue to eat these yucky, yucky lima beans.

12:55.440 --> 12:59.040
I do not care how much butter you put on them, Derek.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.800
They're still lima beans and they're gross.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.560
I'm gonna go ahead and produce a chemical

13:02.560 --> 13:04.240
to hurt my own body.

13:04.240 --> 13:04.800
Thank you.

13:04.800 --> 13:05.760
Thank you, Derek, for this.

13:07.280 --> 13:08.640
And of course, jelly beans

13:08.640 --> 13:11.760
which tastes like the opposite of beans.

13:12.560 --> 13:15.120
Why haven't they made bean-flavored jelly beans?

13:15.120 --> 13:15.680
Thank you.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.120
I bet you somebody has.

13:17.120 --> 13:20.000
You guys are also very limited in the...

13:20.000 --> 13:22.960
I would suggest to you to get into a bean-based diet

13:22.960 --> 13:25.440
because you would be shocked at how many different

13:25.440 --> 13:27.520
permutations of beans there can be.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.440
Like my famous black bean brownies.

13:32.160 --> 13:34.480
That's gonna give you a whole different appreciation

13:34.480 --> 13:37.920
for beans when you're using beans as the brownie batter.

13:38.720 --> 13:41.120
Another one would be roasting the beans

13:41.120 --> 13:42.720
in very hot temperatures.

13:42.720 --> 13:46.000
Turns into something of a crunchy snack.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.160
Kind of like pop beans.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.200
Kind of like pop beans, bean chips.

13:51.200 --> 13:54.400
Now, Justin, is this good advice for someone

13:54.400 --> 13:55.280
who is definitely allergic?

13:55.280 --> 13:57.360
I sat on my beans and made them bean chips.

13:57.360 --> 13:59.040
I sat on my beans.

13:59.040 --> 14:00.080
I sat on my beans and made them bean chips.

14:00.080 --> 14:01.200
But our question asker...

14:01.840 --> 14:05.040
Okay, very allergic to beans.

14:05.040 --> 14:09.200
I sat on my beans.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.800
But listen, Trav.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.400
I sat on my beans.

14:12.400 --> 14:13.760
He sat right on his beans, dude.

14:13.760 --> 14:14.480
I sat on my beans.

14:14.480 --> 14:17.360
No, I was gonna enjoy these beans

14:17.360 --> 14:21.280
and I sat on them.

14:21.280 --> 14:22.320
This is a good question.

14:22.320 --> 14:26.480
Is your boyfriend allergic through skin contact?

14:26.480 --> 14:28.080
Can your boyfriend touch beans?

14:28.080 --> 14:31.360
Because then maybe if he touches enough beans,

14:31.360 --> 14:33.040
he'll get the feel for the beans

14:33.040 --> 14:35.440
and then he can guess what they taste like from the feel.

14:35.440 --> 14:36.880
Yeah, goosh it up in your hand.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.240
Goosh up a bunch of beans in your hand.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.200
Imagine it's your mouth.

14:40.160 --> 14:42.080
Yeah, with your teeth.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.360
But the teeth are your fingers.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.320
You can't be allergic to beans.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.280
What?

14:48.240 --> 14:50.560
I don't think you could be allergic to beans.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.320
You can't be allergic to anything.

14:52.320 --> 14:56.000
I faked a Windex allergy when I worked at Blockbuster

14:56.000 --> 14:57.200
so I wouldn't have to clean.

14:57.840 --> 15:03.040
And I don't think you could be allergic to beans.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.080
Wait, hold on.

15:04.080 --> 15:07.200
So to connect the two things you just said,

15:07.200 --> 15:09.680
based on the fact that you lied about being allergic

15:09.680 --> 15:10.800
to something once,

15:10.800 --> 15:13.600
you think it is impossible to then be allergic to beans?

15:13.600 --> 15:15.760
No, it is, of course, I'm being silly.

15:15.760 --> 15:17.520
It's because they're in the same family as peanuts.

15:17.520 --> 15:19.120
So of course you can be allergic to beans.

15:19.120 --> 15:21.360
But thank you for finally clarifying for us

15:21.360 --> 15:23.760
when you are and aren't being silly on the show.

15:23.760 --> 15:25.280
I'm just having a lot of fun.

15:25.280 --> 15:27.760
If it sounds like I'm having a hoot and a holler,

15:27.760 --> 15:29.280
just the best darn time of my life,

15:29.280 --> 15:31.440
then I'm probably joking around just having some fun

15:31.440 --> 15:32.240
with the listeners.

15:32.240 --> 15:33.440
The listeners and I get it.

15:33.440 --> 15:34.720
It's kind of a private thing.

15:35.280 --> 15:36.320
How about a Yahoo?

15:36.320 --> 15:36.960
Okay.

15:36.960 --> 15:39.840
This one was sent in by so many fucking people, it's wild.

15:39.840 --> 15:40.640
Thank you, everybody.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.120
It's Yahoo Answers user, Parker.

15:43.120 --> 15:44.240
Parker, who asks,

15:45.440 --> 15:48.480
are goldfish the snack cursed?

15:49.840 --> 15:51.520
On the first day of one of my classes,

15:51.520 --> 15:53.040
I was sat in the very front row

15:53.040 --> 15:56.000
and I had a bag of goldfish open for me to snack on.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.240
When reaching for a pencil, I nudged the bag

15:58.240 --> 16:00.560
and it swept the crunchy fish across the table

16:00.560 --> 16:02.160
and some onto the floor.

16:02.160 --> 16:04.800
Three weeks later, I purchased another bag of goldfish

16:04.800 --> 16:06.560
and while struggling to remove my sweater,

16:06.560 --> 16:08.160
I knocked them to the floor

16:08.160 --> 16:10.720
after only a handful have been eaten.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.200
Suggestions?

16:13.200 --> 16:13.760
Huh.

16:13.760 --> 16:16.960
I have spilled two bags of goldfish crackers.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.960
I'm starting to think these things are all cursed.

16:20.960 --> 16:22.560
I'm starting to think that there was a murder.

16:22.560 --> 16:28.000
Somebody fell into the goldfish crunchitizer

16:28.000 --> 16:29.680
at the goldfish factory

16:29.680 --> 16:31.680
and then their angry ghost is going around

16:31.680 --> 16:33.760
and making all the bags fucking fall over.

16:33.760 --> 16:37.680
They are incredibly spillable snack.

16:37.680 --> 16:40.000
I mean, of the snacks, they're incredibly spillable

16:40.000 --> 16:42.960
because goldfish are one of the very few snacks

16:42.960 --> 16:44.640
and really, you won't be able to think of any of them,

16:45.200 --> 16:47.440
I think, that aren't like Pepperidge Farm-based,

16:47.440 --> 16:49.840
but they're a bag with a flat bottom.

16:49.840 --> 16:52.960
Oh, that's just tempting fate if you think about it.

16:52.960 --> 16:54.640
You set that bag up and you're like,

16:54.640 --> 16:56.800
that's fine, it's flat on the bottom,

16:56.800 --> 16:59.760
but you wouldn't do that with fucking any other bag.

16:59.760 --> 17:01.680
You would not set any other bag up and be like,

17:01.680 --> 17:03.120
hey bag, are you cool?

17:03.120 --> 17:04.800
And expect that bag to be cool.

17:04.800 --> 17:07.360
The goldfish lure you into this false sense of security

17:07.360 --> 17:10.400
like, hey, we know there's a thousand of us

17:10.400 --> 17:12.880
and we're in a bag, but it'll be fine.

17:12.880 --> 17:14.480
Just walk away, it's fine.

17:15.840 --> 17:17.680
Sometimes they come in a milk carton too

17:17.680 --> 17:18.960
and that's just trickery.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.040
That's just roguish trickery

17:21.040 --> 17:23.760
because I'm going to see that on the shelf in the pantry

17:23.760 --> 17:24.320
and I'm going to think,

17:25.200 --> 17:27.120
Dylan left the milk out in the pantry again,

17:27.120 --> 17:29.040
why doesn't he get where this actually goes?

17:30.000 --> 17:32.160
And then I'm so busy yelling at Dylan,

17:32.160 --> 17:34.000
I haven't even realized the mistake that I've made,

17:34.000 --> 17:36.480
which is that they're cheesy crackers and not milk.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.640
Do you think it's the ghost of goldfish?

17:38.640 --> 17:40.560
Interesting, every time you crunch one of them,

17:40.560 --> 17:41.680
a little ghost comes out

17:42.720 --> 17:45.520
and either tries to push over its bag,

17:45.520 --> 17:47.200
but there's just one of them.

17:47.200 --> 17:50.240
So really, I think by the laws of physics,

17:50.240 --> 17:51.840
you have to have eaten half the bag

17:51.840 --> 17:53.920
and then you'll have half a bag worth of goldfish ghosts

17:53.920 --> 17:57.840
who are then capable of knocking over their partners

17:57.840 --> 17:59.840
who are still remaining, still living inside the bag.

18:00.400 --> 18:04.880
There was one day many years ago at Pepperidge Farm

18:04.880 --> 18:09.120
where a well-meaning chef said,

18:09.120 --> 18:12.800
hi, everyone, I've made new cheese crackers

18:12.800 --> 18:14.240
and I'd like everyone to enjoy them.

18:14.240 --> 18:16.880
They're small and I think you're really gonna like them.

18:16.880 --> 18:20.480
And the guy everybody at the office hates,

18:21.040 --> 18:22.160
whose name is Billup.

18:22.960 --> 18:25.120
Billup tries one and he's like,

18:26.000 --> 18:29.280
mm, close, but I think I'd like them more

18:29.280 --> 18:31.200
if they're shaped like an animal.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.520
They're like, huh, what kind?

18:33.520 --> 18:35.360
What kind?

18:35.360 --> 18:40.880
A pet, like a pet that people have, that everybody has.

18:40.880 --> 18:42.960
I wish they were shaped like pets that we have,

18:42.960 --> 18:43.920
the goldfish pets.

18:44.480 --> 18:45.600
Well, why do you wanna eat?

18:45.600 --> 18:46.240
I just don't know.

18:46.240 --> 18:47.360
I just think I'd like it better

18:47.360 --> 18:48.960
if they're shaped like one of my pets

18:48.960 --> 18:50.160
and I could eat a bunch of them

18:50.160 --> 18:51.600
in front of my goldfish that I have,

18:51.600 --> 18:53.200
my real animal goldfish.

18:53.200 --> 18:53.700
Why?

18:55.440 --> 18:58.240
We put them in a tiny prison, give them dirt,

18:59.440 --> 19:01.920
and also watch me eat crackers of you

19:01.920 --> 19:03.600
for your entire life.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.680
I watched a David Blaine magic trick

19:05.680 --> 19:07.680
where he did eat three goldfish

19:07.680 --> 19:09.520
and then he did throw them all up

19:09.520 --> 19:10.640
and everybody at the party,

19:10.640 --> 19:12.480
like Jake Gyllenhaal, freaked the fuck out.

19:12.480 --> 19:14.960
And I saw that and I said, I would like to do that,

19:14.960 --> 19:16.240
but I wanna keep them down.

19:16.240 --> 19:18.800
And I also wanna be made out of cheesy cracker stuff

19:18.800 --> 19:19.840
because that's my shit.

19:20.480 --> 19:22.560
My boyfriend and I recently moved to do a house.

19:22.560 --> 19:23.520
While mowing the lawn,

19:23.520 --> 19:26.320
my boyfriend was apparently enjoying his time in the sun

19:26.320 --> 19:29.280
and decided on a whim to mow the neighbor's front lawn as well.

19:29.280 --> 19:31.760
Well, hmm, we have met our neighbors briefly

19:31.760 --> 19:33.280
and shared neighborly conversation,

19:33.280 --> 19:34.880
but we really don't know each other.

19:34.880 --> 19:37.440
He didn't say anything to them about mowing their lawn

19:37.440 --> 19:39.600
and just thought of it as a nice thing to do.

19:39.600 --> 19:42.000
I'm worried that our neighbors will be confused at best

19:42.000 --> 19:44.080
and worse interpret this as a passive aggressive comment

19:44.080 --> 19:44.880
on their lawn care.

19:44.880 --> 19:47.040
It was, should we knock on the door?

19:47.040 --> 19:48.640
Okay, it doesn't say that.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.480
That's Justin's commentary.

19:50.480 --> 19:53.600
Yeah, should we knock on the door

19:53.600 --> 19:54.640
and explain that we're not weird?

19:54.640 --> 19:55.840
That's from Sybil and Cincy.

19:55.840 --> 19:57.120
Let me explain my comment.

19:57.120 --> 19:59.520
What I'm saying is you looked at their lawn

19:59.520 --> 20:00.240
and said, that's long enough.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.040
Somebody should gut it.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.100
Yeah.

20:04.480 --> 20:10.800
I mean, it's good that your partner Gleeb Glow

20:10.800 --> 20:12.720
from the planet Mars 8.

20:12.720 --> 20:14.080
What is he doing?

20:14.080 --> 20:14.800
What are you doing?

20:14.800 --> 20:16.640
I'd like to mow two lawns.

20:16.640 --> 20:18.000
What are you doing?

20:19.760 --> 20:22.160
The only way I think that you can get away with this

20:22.160 --> 20:24.800
is to have your boyfriend knock on their door

20:24.800 --> 20:28.240
and request $10 for having mowed their lawn

20:28.240 --> 20:30.080
and then they refuse and he goes like,

20:30.080 --> 20:31.680
well, I never or whatever.

20:31.680 --> 20:33.040
And then he walks away

20:33.040 --> 20:34.400
because if someone was just like,

20:34.400 --> 20:36.160
hey, just letting you know I mowed your lawn,

20:36.160 --> 20:39.280
I would assume some kind of intent

20:39.280 --> 20:41.600
that was about judging me or something.

20:41.600 --> 20:42.960
But if they said like, I did it

20:42.960 --> 20:44.160
and now I expect to be paid,

20:44.160 --> 20:46.160
I'd be like, oh, I understand this.

20:46.160 --> 20:47.920
I get what this transaction is.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.200
What would you do if they came home

20:51.200 --> 20:55.200
and you were in the yard, in their yard,

20:55.200 --> 20:58.320
mowing their grass with your machine

20:58.320 --> 21:01.520
at your height of grass that you like it cut

21:01.520 --> 21:02.880
with your dirty machine?

21:04.560 --> 21:05.840
What if they have special seed?

21:06.480 --> 21:07.680
What if they have special grass?

21:08.800 --> 21:09.760
Hey, here's one.

21:10.720 --> 21:12.480
What if they like to cut their grass?

21:12.480 --> 21:12.880
That's it.

21:12.880 --> 21:15.680
What if one of them is Gleeb Glow from Mars 8 also

21:15.680 --> 21:18.720
and they want to mow at least one lawn this month?

21:18.720 --> 21:20.240
They love mowing their lawn

21:20.240 --> 21:21.520
and you stole that from them.

21:21.520 --> 21:24.560
What if it's the last good mow of the year?

21:27.680 --> 21:30.640
And you've been saving up that last glass of lemonade?

21:32.480 --> 21:34.560
You're good mowing shorts.

21:34.560 --> 21:38.080
What if, what if they can't mow the lawn

21:38.800 --> 21:40.560
because their children got shrunk down?

21:40.560 --> 21:41.600
Oh no!

21:41.600 --> 21:43.200
You asshole!

21:43.200 --> 21:46.160
You asshole killed their freaking little kids.

21:46.160 --> 21:47.680
You mowed their little kids.

21:47.680 --> 21:49.360
You mowed all their little, little kids,

21:49.360 --> 21:50.720
their little, little teenage kids

21:50.720 --> 21:52.640
that shrunk down accidentally.

21:52.640 --> 21:54.400
What did you think it was?

21:54.400 --> 21:55.120
A gnoll?

21:55.920 --> 21:57.920
Some sort of chipmunk?

21:57.920 --> 21:59.920
No, that was their children.

21:59.920 --> 22:03.360
How small are the children that they're about chipmunk size

22:03.360 --> 22:04.560
when you're like, nah, this is fine.

22:06.560 --> 22:08.000
The grass is so tall.

22:09.040 --> 22:10.560
They have no chance.

22:10.560 --> 22:12.800
Oh no, I ran over their Legos.

22:12.800 --> 22:14.720
I ran over their oatmeal cream pie.

22:15.280 --> 22:18.400
Hey squad, you know that scene

22:18.400 --> 22:19.840
in Honey I Shrunk the Kids

22:20.720 --> 22:22.560
where they're with the aunt

22:22.560 --> 22:24.560
and they're surviving out in the backyard

22:24.560 --> 22:26.320
and they come across an oatmeal cream pie

22:26.320 --> 22:28.000
and all start having a big snack of it?

22:29.520 --> 22:29.760
Yeah.

22:31.040 --> 22:33.200
Why the fuck was there a whole oatmeal cream pie?

22:34.640 --> 22:37.200
Whole oatmeal cream pie just sitting out in their backyard?

22:37.920 --> 22:39.840
Who is walking around in their backyard

22:39.840 --> 22:41.440
trying to go from point A to point B

22:41.440 --> 22:43.200
with their snack on oatmeal cream pie,

22:43.200 --> 22:46.240
which was normal size to them, a big teenager,

22:46.240 --> 22:48.400
and then they dropped it and they were like,

22:48.400 --> 22:50.800
nah, that's just gonna stay right there on the ground.

22:52.080 --> 22:53.520
It's such a good question.

22:53.520 --> 22:54.880
They're so good.

22:54.880 --> 22:59.280
What kind of dirtbag is like,

22:59.280 --> 23:02.800
that's fucking fine, I love ants and I hate snacks.

23:02.800 --> 23:03.520
Just leave it.

23:03.520 --> 23:05.040
What am I gonna do, pick it up?

23:05.040 --> 23:05.920
Come on.

23:05.920 --> 23:08.000
Come on, with these ants?

23:08.000 --> 23:09.680
With these beautiful manicures?

23:09.680 --> 23:11.120
No way, leave it.

23:11.120 --> 23:12.640
I'm on my way inside.

23:13.200 --> 23:15.280
I'm Matt Brewer and I'm a dirtbag

23:15.280 --> 23:17.600
and I'm gonna leave that exactly where I dropped it.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.000
Who's playing with Legos outside?

23:24.320 --> 23:26.640
You know, at least one of those kids

23:26.640 --> 23:28.320
had to keep using the laser machine

23:28.320 --> 23:30.880
to shrink themselves down and eat big oatmeal cream.

23:30.880 --> 23:32.000
That's the fucking best.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.600
I don't wanna get squashed or mowed down

23:33.600 --> 23:35.600
and I obviously gotta go to school

23:35.600 --> 23:38.240
and I can't be one inch high while I'm doing that shit.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.400
But guys, I gotta tell you,

23:41.600 --> 23:44.080
I do miss the big oatmeal cream pie days.

23:44.080 --> 23:46.000
Do you remember the big oatmeal cream pie times?

23:46.000 --> 23:47.920
We almost got killed by a scorpion or whatever,

23:47.920 --> 23:49.200
but the big oatmeal cream pie

23:49.200 --> 23:51.040
was the best moment of my life, I think.

23:51.040 --> 23:53.440
I did very much enjoy the huge oatmeal cream pie.

23:54.160 --> 23:58.000
It's just, I don't, I don't, okay.

23:58.720 --> 24:00.720
The number one thing that is wild

24:00.720 --> 24:02.720
about the oatmeal cream pie is,

24:02.720 --> 24:04.400
I dropped an oatmeal cream pie outside,

24:04.400 --> 24:06.720
I'm just gonna leave it all well, then it's the breaks.

24:06.720 --> 24:07.280
That's wild.

24:07.920 --> 24:09.280
The other thing that's wild is

24:09.280 --> 24:12.080
that's the first ant that found it.

24:12.080 --> 24:14.160
The ant they befriend is the first ant

24:14.160 --> 24:15.360
to find this fucking thing.

24:15.360 --> 24:16.560
Are you kidding me?

24:16.560 --> 24:20.000
If I leave one chunk of apple,

24:20.000 --> 24:22.640
which is gross compared to an oatmeal cream pie.

24:22.640 --> 24:24.720
It's, oh God, disgusting comparison.

24:24.720 --> 24:26.800
Covered, covered in ants.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.480
Five seconds later, covered in ants.

24:28.480 --> 24:31.120
You tell me this thing isn't getting wrecked by ants?

24:31.120 --> 24:31.600
No way.

24:32.640 --> 24:35.200
I'm leaving this as a plot hole on the IMDB page.

24:35.200 --> 24:36.960
Let's fucking trash this flick.

24:36.960 --> 24:37.280
Yeah.

24:38.400 --> 24:40.160
Hey, how come in honey we shrunk ourselves

24:40.160 --> 24:42.320
where the parents got themselves shrunk down

24:42.320 --> 24:43.760
and the parents find them,

24:43.760 --> 24:46.720
the kids aren't like, I'm gonna grow you back,

24:46.720 --> 24:48.960
but hold up, y'all have got to eat

24:48.960 --> 24:50.720
one of these oatmeal cream pies

24:50.720 --> 24:53.120
and go down the kitchen and give their little parents

24:53.120 --> 24:54.640
a big oatmeal cream pies.

24:54.640 --> 24:56.240
Like, that seems fucked up.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.080
How come by the third movie,

24:58.080 --> 25:01.760
the Zelenskys aren't like fucking super rich?

25:01.760 --> 25:03.520
Cause like Wayne could just like

25:03.520 --> 25:05.920
make an oatmeal cream pie really big

25:05.920 --> 25:07.760
and be like, hey, everybody in town,

25:07.760 --> 25:10.800
you can stay normal size, but come fucking feast

25:10.800 --> 25:12.400
on this oatmeal cream pie.

25:12.400 --> 25:15.840
I've fixed starvation forever.

25:15.840 --> 25:16.400
Yeah.

25:18.640 --> 25:21.040
Anyway, I'd love to eat that oatmeal cream pie.

25:21.040 --> 25:24.240
I want a fucking oatmeal cream pie.

25:24.240 --> 25:27.440
God, fuck that makes me so angry.

25:27.440 --> 25:29.200
I'll never get to have that.

25:29.200 --> 25:30.640
Pay any cards.

25:30.640 --> 25:32.880
I'm gonna make a company called Big Debbie

25:32.880 --> 25:34.560
and it only makes big snacks.

25:34.560 --> 25:36.000
For big boys.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.800
For big boys, for big boys.

25:40.800 --> 25:44.160
Hi, I'm Big Debbie and I'm ready to blast

25:44.160 --> 25:45.600
your big ass hunger.

25:48.160 --> 25:51.120
Oatmeal cream pies the size of a whole fucking pie.

25:51.120 --> 25:52.000
Let's do this.

25:52.640 --> 25:54.080
Open up, motherfucker.

25:56.480 --> 25:59.920
These are my jacked zebra cakes full of protein

25:59.920 --> 26:01.120
for big boys.

26:02.960 --> 26:05.120
And the fucking, the mascot's just a ripped

26:05.120 --> 26:08.320
fucking zebra, just jacked muscles.

26:08.320 --> 26:09.600
Come on, big boys.

26:11.280 --> 26:13.280
Are you gonna eat this star crunch asshole

26:13.280 --> 26:15.920
or you want to drink some unsweetened tea?

26:18.160 --> 26:19.680
It's October, motherfuckers.

26:19.680 --> 26:22.240
Have one of our weird pumpkin shaped things.

26:22.800 --> 26:24.880
This time it's a whole fucking pumpkin

26:24.880 --> 26:26.640
full of protein powder.

26:26.640 --> 26:27.760
Come on, coward.

26:27.760 --> 26:29.200
I'm here to fuck you up.

26:29.200 --> 26:30.720
Did I make it protein?

26:30.720 --> 26:32.880
They've all got fucking protein now.

26:33.440 --> 26:34.000
Hell yeah.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.840
Get swole.

26:35.840 --> 26:37.760
Get swole with me, Big Debbie.

26:37.760 --> 26:40.080
But please continue to patronize my granddaughter,

26:40.640 --> 26:41.360
Little Debbie.

26:42.400 --> 26:45.120
I care about her and I'm so proud of her small business.

26:46.320 --> 26:48.160
Can you imagine being at a business meeting

26:48.160 --> 26:48.960
with Little Debbie?

26:49.680 --> 26:50.880
That'd be wild.

26:50.880 --> 26:51.920
So cute.

26:51.920 --> 26:54.400
I think it'd go a little something like this.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.080
You think if you have a business meeting

26:56.080 --> 26:57.200
at Little Debbie Co.

26:58.400 --> 26:59.360
I love Little Debbie.

26:59.360 --> 27:00.800
I know the family of Little Debbie

27:00.800 --> 27:02.720
is a listener to the show and thank you so much.

27:02.720 --> 27:03.840
I appreciate you.

27:03.840 --> 27:05.600
Because they've sent us some Little Debbie's before.

27:05.600 --> 27:09.120
If you have, they sent me some Little Debbie's for everyone.

27:10.080 --> 27:12.240
If you have a business meeting at Little Debbie,

27:12.800 --> 27:14.640
do you have to serve Little Debbie's

27:14.640 --> 27:15.680
at the business meeting?

27:15.680 --> 27:17.200
Because one, yes.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.560
I will take a meeting at Little Debbie

27:18.560 --> 27:22.320
if those are the conditions of the gathering.

27:22.320 --> 27:25.760
Second, there's some times where maybe it's not appropriate.

27:25.760 --> 27:28.080
Maybe it's not appropriate to have a big plate

27:28.080 --> 27:31.760
full of zebra bars or star crunches

27:31.760 --> 27:34.240
or Christmas tree cakes.

27:34.240 --> 27:36.000
Although those are my fucking shit though.

27:36.000 --> 27:36.480
Oh really?

27:36.480 --> 27:38.400
I love the Swiss cake rolls.

27:38.400 --> 27:39.760
I like the shortcake rolls.

27:39.760 --> 27:41.280
I like my food in a roll form.

27:42.320 --> 27:45.040
This is a fun universe that Justin's invented though

27:45.040 --> 27:48.400
where at the McDonald's corporate headquarters

27:48.400 --> 27:51.840
they're talking about how they've seen just more

27:51.840 --> 27:55.200
and more of their profits be wicked away by Chipotle

27:55.200 --> 27:56.800
and this could be the end of Ronald this year.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.920
And then they come in and they do have a bunch

27:59.920 --> 28:02.080
of their nasty burgers and chicken nuggets

28:02.080 --> 28:07.040
and when they say, I'm worth 30 million dollars

28:07.040 --> 28:10.160
but I guess we do have to eat our dirty chicken balls.

28:13.040 --> 28:17.040
If you have a picnic, you can't just get subs.

28:17.040 --> 28:18.400
That's what I'm saying.

28:18.400 --> 28:20.000
If you have a McDonald's corporate picnic,

28:20.000 --> 28:22.800
you can't just like, you know what I love this time?

28:22.800 --> 28:23.360
Pizza.

28:24.080 --> 28:26.000
No, absolutely not.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.960
Well, this is McDonald's pizza.

28:28.960 --> 28:31.600
Don't tease me with the McPizza, please.

28:32.160 --> 28:33.680
Can we please go to the money zone?

28:33.680 --> 28:34.480
I'm there already.

28:46.480 --> 28:47.600
Look around you.

28:47.600 --> 28:50.800
I have changed the walls in every direction

28:50.800 --> 28:53.600
that you're not looking until finally you spin wildly

28:53.600 --> 28:55.760
and notice that you've been in the money zone for hours.

28:55.760 --> 28:59.600
Our first sponsor this week is Stamps.com.

28:59.600 --> 29:02.160
You can get everything you want on demand.

29:02.160 --> 29:07.120
Podcasts, Little Debbie's, that's if you work there, of course.

29:07.120 --> 29:10.880
I don't think you can get Little Debbie's on demand

29:10.880 --> 29:12.400
if you work at Little Debbie, Justin.

29:12.400 --> 29:15.040
Stop punching me, motherfucker!

29:15.040 --> 29:15.840
Not any Little Debbie.

29:15.840 --> 29:17.200
It comes through pneumatic tubes.

29:18.400 --> 29:21.200
You pull a lever and one blasts out of a pneumatic tube

29:21.200 --> 29:22.880
into your mouth and you take whatever you get

29:22.880 --> 29:24.560
and you love it because they're all great.

29:24.560 --> 29:27.440
Except peanut butter bars, I'm not crazy about that.

29:27.440 --> 29:28.160
Whoa!

29:28.160 --> 29:31.040
You can get postage on demand

29:31.600 --> 29:34.320
and then mail the Little Debbie home to your family,

29:34.320 --> 29:36.320
but that is a violation of company policy

29:36.320 --> 29:38.160
and you will be terminated if caught.

29:38.160 --> 29:41.760
With Stamps.com, you can access all the amazing services

29:41.760 --> 29:45.360
of the post office except for looking at wanted posters

29:45.360 --> 29:46.880
because they don't do that anymore.

29:48.480 --> 29:49.280
And I asked.

29:50.080 --> 29:53.920
You could buy and print official US postage for any letter,

29:53.920 --> 29:57.120
any package using your own computer and printer

29:57.120 --> 29:59.360
and the mail carrier picks it up,

29:59.360 --> 30:01.840
which seems like a feature until you realize

30:01.840 --> 30:04.320
they come to your house every day and it would be wild

30:04.320 --> 30:06.720
if they weren't like, I'll take this.

30:06.720 --> 30:11.040
It's nice, it's a nice feature, but just like mail is nice.

30:11.040 --> 30:14.720
Right now, you can use My Brother, all one word,

30:14.720 --> 30:16.240
for this special offer.

30:16.240 --> 30:18.720
It's a code, My Brother, for this special offer.

30:18.720 --> 30:21.680
It includes up to $55 of free postage,

30:21.680 --> 30:24.960
a digital scale and a four week trial, so don't wait.

30:24.960 --> 30:27.440
Go to Stamps.com before you do anything else,

30:27.440 --> 30:31.040
click on the radio microphone at the top of the homepage

30:31.040 --> 30:33.040
and type My Brother.

30:33.680 --> 30:36.320
That's Stamps.com, click the microphone

30:36.320 --> 30:38.560
and then enter My Brother.

30:38.560 --> 30:42.480
Boy, I just don't ever wanna say enter My Brother.

30:42.480 --> 30:45.360
If I could just avoid that exact phrasing,

30:45.360 --> 30:46.880
it would be great, thank you.

30:47.440 --> 30:50.240
Do you think that right now there is like an executive

30:50.240 --> 30:53.200
from Stamps.com calling little Debbie and like,

30:53.200 --> 30:55.920
hey, could you pay for part of this ad that we did?

30:55.920 --> 30:59.520
Cause a lot of it was about you and you could just kick in

30:59.520 --> 31:02.160
like 20, 30%, that would be great.

31:02.160 --> 31:03.120
That'd be awesome.

31:03.120 --> 31:04.240
Hey, I wanna tell you about Quip.

31:04.240 --> 31:07.120
Quip is great, they make really great toothbrushes.

31:07.120 --> 31:10.240
I recently picked one up a couple months ago

31:10.240 --> 31:12.080
and have been brushing with it and it's so nice.

31:12.080 --> 31:14.400
I really like traveling with it.

31:14.400 --> 31:15.520
I think we've talked about this before,

31:15.520 --> 31:19.440
it's got this like case that you can stick onto your mirror

31:19.440 --> 31:21.360
and you can pop it off at any time.

31:21.360 --> 31:23.360
I thought like because you could stick it on and pop it off,

31:23.360 --> 31:24.800
like it wouldn't stick after a while,

31:24.800 --> 31:26.960
but it just keeps sticking and it's amazing.

31:26.960 --> 31:28.240
But then you can take that case

31:28.240 --> 31:30.240
and just like put the toothbrush inside it

31:30.240 --> 31:31.760
and it's an easy travel case, it's awesome.

31:32.640 --> 31:35.440
Their Sonic Vibrations are designed to be gentle enough

31:35.440 --> 31:38.880
for sensitive gums and Quip toothbrushes run

31:38.880 --> 31:41.200
for three months on one charge.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.120
Also, brush heads are automatically delivered

31:43.120 --> 31:45.520
on a dentist recommended schedule every three months

31:45.520 --> 31:46.880
for just five bucks.

31:46.880 --> 31:48.160
So you can get the brush that is backed

31:48.160 --> 31:50.480
by over 20,000 dental professionals.

31:50.480 --> 31:52.080
Quip starts at just $25.

31:52.080 --> 31:55.680
And if you go to getquip.com slash my brother right now,

31:55.680 --> 31:57.680
you can get your first refill pack for free

31:57.680 --> 31:58.880
with a Quip electric toothbrush.

31:58.880 --> 32:03.680
That's your first refill pack free at G-E-T-Q-U-I-P.com

32:03.680 --> 32:04.800
slash my brother.

32:05.840 --> 32:09.680
I have a Jumbotron and it's from Anna

32:09.680 --> 32:11.840
and it's for Alex Slater.

32:12.640 --> 32:15.520
Sweetest greetings to my best friend ever.

32:15.520 --> 32:18.240
Our traveling shenanigans have evolved from getting lost

32:18.240 --> 32:19.760
on our way to see Star Trek

32:19.760 --> 32:22.240
to unforgettable cross country road trips.

32:22.240 --> 32:24.240
Here's to a lifetime of great stories

32:24.240 --> 32:25.680
and adventures to come.

32:25.680 --> 32:28.960
I'm so proud of the beautiful scarlet haired warrior woman

32:28.960 --> 32:29.840
you will always be.

32:30.400 --> 32:30.880
Love you.

32:31.520 --> 32:32.320
That's nice.

32:33.920 --> 32:35.120
What's wrong Griffin?

32:35.120 --> 32:37.120
I'm just more of a Star Wars guy, I guess.

32:37.120 --> 32:40.000
I hate, I love Star Wars so much

32:40.000 --> 32:41.520
with all of the cool lightsabers.

32:41.520 --> 32:47.920
And you're really one of the architects of that world.

32:47.920 --> 32:49.200
I'm one of the architects, yeah.

32:49.200 --> 32:51.600
So when they jump you in, George says,

32:51.600 --> 32:54.640
he says, no more Star Trek, okay, boy.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.920
And I said, okay, dad.

32:57.920 --> 32:59.200
Justin, you wanna read the next one?

33:01.520 --> 33:03.920
It would be my great honor.

33:03.920 --> 33:11.040
This is a message for Claire or V and Fiona or Janice or Yannis.

33:11.040 --> 33:11.760
Probably Janice.

33:12.320 --> 33:13.120
It's Janice.

33:13.120 --> 33:13.760
Or Janice.

33:14.640 --> 33:16.560
It's from Emily, your DM and best friend.

33:16.560 --> 33:19.360
Thank you both so much for playing D&D with me,

33:20.000 --> 33:21.600
for partying with me in the center

33:21.600 --> 33:24.720
of one of the most niche Venn diagrams ever

33:24.720 --> 33:26.960
and for the incredible friendship we share

33:26.960 --> 33:28.160
that's helped me through the past few

33:28.160 --> 33:30.080
whack tumultuous years of my life.

33:30.080 --> 33:32.320
2015 may be over, oops.

33:32.320 --> 33:34.080
But I'm so glad that the three of us

33:34.080 --> 33:36.960
are still together enjoying the long, long grift.

33:36.960 --> 33:37.680
I love you.

33:37.680 --> 33:41.200
Now, Justin, I'm-

33:41.200 --> 33:42.320
Okay, I understand.

33:43.600 --> 33:45.200
I understand what happened.

33:45.200 --> 33:47.040
We've done bad before,

33:47.040 --> 33:51.840
but I don't think we've done three and a half years bad before.

33:51.840 --> 33:53.200
I understand what happened now.

33:55.200 --> 33:59.760
Welcome everyone to the live wrestling spectacular in Los Angeles.

33:59.760 --> 34:02.320
So far, the world's most boring wrestling podcast

34:02.320 --> 34:04.480
has been destroying the competition.

34:04.480 --> 34:08.240
Isn't there anyone who can save us from this travesty?

34:09.040 --> 34:10.800
Wait, could it be?

34:10.800 --> 34:13.760
It's Tights and Fights, the perfect wrestling podcast.

34:15.040 --> 34:16.960
Tights and Fights is here to save us

34:16.960 --> 34:19.760
from the monotony of boring wrestling podcasts

34:19.760 --> 34:21.360
with hilarious conversations.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.480
Woke trips through the history of wrestling.

34:24.480 --> 34:28.000
And joke about the finer points of people wearing spandex.

34:32.880 --> 34:34.000
What a match!

34:34.000 --> 34:36.880
And the Tights and Fights podcast will be back every week.

34:36.880 --> 34:41.280
Thursdays on MaximumFun.org or wherever you get podcasts.

34:41.280 --> 34:42.960
Please, these hosts have families.

34:53.840 --> 34:54.720
Hey, how about a Yahoo?

34:56.320 --> 34:56.820
Sure.

34:57.600 --> 34:59.520
This one was sent in by Michelle Smith.

34:59.520 --> 35:00.080
Thank you, Michelle.

35:00.080 --> 35:01.600
It's Yahoo Answers user Andrew.

35:01.600 --> 35:05.120
It's Jermaine to what we were talking about earlier.

35:05.120 --> 35:09.440
Andrew asks, which do you like better horses or camels?

35:12.960 --> 35:14.320
Keep in mind while we talk about this

35:14.320 --> 35:16.160
that horses are completely over

35:16.160 --> 35:19.760
and we need something like a new joke, I guess.

35:20.560 --> 35:23.760
Andrew says, the reason why I like camels more than horses

35:23.760 --> 35:25.360
is because if one treats it right,

35:25.360 --> 35:28.400
one is actually safer around a camel than a horse.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.000
Camels are smarter than horses.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.480
It is better than horses at perceiving threats.

35:33.120 --> 35:36.400
The trade-off is that the camel is more powerful animal

35:36.400 --> 35:38.960
and it's bigger and harder to mount to ride

35:38.960 --> 35:41.600
and likes to mess with and try to eat hair.

35:42.400 --> 35:44.960
And it won't be around you if you mistreat it just one time.

35:44.960 --> 35:47.440
And then the camel will be a dangerous animal to be around.

35:47.440 --> 35:49.040
But compared to being kicked by a horse,

35:49.040 --> 35:51.040
it's not that bad of trade-off.

35:51.040 --> 35:53.920
The camel also has a way more efficient stride.

35:55.200 --> 35:55.700
Okay.

35:55.700 --> 35:59.700
Okay, but also camels are harder to sit on?

36:00.900 --> 36:03.380
That depends because I bet you could find a groove

36:03.380 --> 36:06.820
that perfectly matches your grundle.

36:06.820 --> 36:07.940
Do you know what I mean?

36:07.940 --> 36:08.500
Jellybean?

36:10.020 --> 36:11.540
There's a perfect, there's a perfect,

36:11.540 --> 36:12.820
horses are all cookie cutter

36:12.820 --> 36:16.020
except for some of these fucking awful, awful horses

36:16.020 --> 36:18.660
I found on Craigslist, just these little mutants.

36:19.860 --> 36:22.740
But there's probably, you know, no two camels are the same.

36:22.740 --> 36:24.980
And so there's probably one out there

36:24.980 --> 36:29.780
that like if a tailor perfectly measured my googer,

36:30.980 --> 36:33.220
then it could find a camel that perfectly matched

36:33.220 --> 36:35.380
the dimensions of said googer.

36:35.380 --> 36:37.620
Like how a wand chooses the wizard in Harry Potter.

36:37.620 --> 36:38.820
It's exactly like that.

36:38.820 --> 36:43.460
I want to go to Ollivander's Googer Measuring Camel Provider

36:43.460 --> 36:47.220
outfitter and what's wrong, Juice?

36:47.220 --> 36:52.980
They sell cigarettes to kids and horses are beautiful

36:52.980 --> 36:54.820
and there's not any comparison.

36:54.820 --> 36:56.260
They're lucky they have four legs

36:56.260 --> 36:57.860
because otherwise people would never mention them

36:57.860 --> 36:59.860
in same breath as horses.

37:01.540 --> 37:04.180
Well, I guess we know where Justin stands.

37:04.180 --> 37:05.300
Here's two words for you.

37:06.020 --> 37:06.660
Equine.

37:07.780 --> 37:09.860
Here's another word, dromedary.

37:12.340 --> 37:15.220
The second one sounds like a fart of words

37:15.220 --> 37:19.940
and the equine sounds like a loot player

37:20.980 --> 37:23.940
took a unicorn hair and plucked the finest note.

37:23.940 --> 37:26.500
Possible is what equine sounds like.

37:26.500 --> 37:28.820
And I think, yeah, no thanks.

37:29.940 --> 37:31.140
All right, asked and answered.

37:31.140 --> 37:32.100
Next question.

37:32.100 --> 37:32.580
Got them.

37:33.140 --> 37:33.780
We got them.

37:35.860 --> 37:36.900
I have a quick...

37:39.540 --> 37:41.300
I've been wanting to develop a segment

37:41.300 --> 37:42.980
that's sort of like Munch Squad Jr.

37:43.620 --> 37:46.500
Where I don't necessarily do the song

37:46.500 --> 37:47.460
and interrupt the show,

37:47.460 --> 37:49.460
but I just mentioned some headlines.

37:50.820 --> 37:52.180
Some quick headlines.

37:52.180 --> 37:54.660
And I just wanted to mention this quick headline.

37:54.660 --> 37:55.780
This is, so this is...

37:57.620 --> 37:58.500
Munch Squad Jr.

37:59.700 --> 38:00.420
Oh, yeah.

38:02.180 --> 38:02.820
Okay.

38:02.820 --> 38:04.420
So here's, there's a new,

38:04.420 --> 38:07.700
there's a salad chain that's on the cusp of just blowing up.

38:07.700 --> 38:09.940
Can you make a sound effect of you skateboarding up?

38:09.940 --> 38:11.060
Like, I don't know what that sounds like,

38:11.060 --> 38:13.700
but you skateboarding up for Munch Squad Jr.

38:13.700 --> 38:13.940
Okay.

38:19.700 --> 38:20.660
Munch Squad Jr.

38:20.660 --> 38:22.420
Don't skateboard away.

38:22.420 --> 38:23.380
Come back.

38:23.380 --> 38:24.420
Munch Squad Jr.

38:25.380 --> 38:26.820
Oh, no, he left.

38:26.820 --> 38:28.020
Oh, I liked him.

38:29.060 --> 38:29.620
I'm back.

38:30.340 --> 38:31.060
Oh, yeah.

38:31.060 --> 38:32.500
Now you have to do it all in that voice.

38:32.500 --> 38:32.740
Okay.

38:32.740 --> 38:34.340
Now tell me the good, tell me the good news.

38:34.340 --> 38:36.900
I just, it's just one thing I wanted to let you all know.

38:36.900 --> 38:40.100
There's an Oklahoma-based salad chain.

38:40.100 --> 38:41.380
It's blowing up.

38:41.380 --> 38:44.020
They got Robert Lee at the helm, CEO.

38:44.020 --> 38:45.780
Just made a new leadership hire.

38:45.780 --> 38:46.820
It's Todd Madlener.

38:47.780 --> 38:49.540
He's gonna be the veep of operations.

38:49.540 --> 38:52.420
Coming over from Red Robin after 20 years.

38:52.420 --> 38:57.380
And the name of this chain is Cool Greens.

38:59.780 --> 39:02.100
And it's one word and it doesn't sound real,

39:02.100 --> 39:03.540
but it's Cool Greens.

39:03.540 --> 39:04.820
And Todd says,

39:04.820 --> 39:08.260
I am very excited about the opportunity with Cool Greens

39:08.260 --> 39:10.980
and get back into an underserved segment

39:10.980 --> 39:12.420
of fast casual dining.

39:12.420 --> 39:14.820
The salad segment, says Madlener.

39:14.820 --> 39:17.380
There are burger and pizza joints at every corner

39:17.380 --> 39:19.540
while the salad and healthy concepts

39:19.540 --> 39:21.060
are underserved in the US.

39:21.060 --> 39:22.580
I wonder why, Todd.

39:23.380 --> 39:26.660
Cool Greens gives me a chance to get back into the segment

39:26.660 --> 39:29.380
and offer something different to franchisees

39:29.380 --> 39:32.180
looking to diversify their business portfolio

39:32.180 --> 39:35.780
or wanna join the growing, healthy, fast casual segment.

39:35.780 --> 39:40.260
And that restaurant again is called Cool Greens.

39:41.460 --> 39:43.540
Cool, cool, Cool Greens.

39:44.340 --> 39:46.340
I just Cool Greens.

39:46.340 --> 39:47.620
There's no way, bud.

39:48.420 --> 39:53.460
The only way that Greens become cool as a brand

39:54.020 --> 39:56.820
is if you sold salads

39:56.820 --> 40:00.900
that did have tokens for Chuck E Cheese arcade games

40:01.460 --> 40:03.300
scattered like that was the time.

40:03.300 --> 40:05.620
It was croutons and some feta

40:05.620 --> 40:06.900
and a little bit of cranberry

40:06.900 --> 40:09.220
and tokens that you could use to play arcade games

40:09.220 --> 40:10.420
at Davin Buster's.

40:11.300 --> 40:12.500
Here's your salad.

40:12.500 --> 40:17.140
It's got, we've got croutons and we've got raisins

40:17.140 --> 40:20.260
and we've got fresh Prince of Bel-Air trading cards

40:20.260 --> 40:22.340
and they're right in there.

40:23.060 --> 40:24.260
Shredded right up.

40:24.260 --> 40:27.060
We got baby spinach.

40:27.060 --> 40:32.900
We've got little chunks of fresh Granny Smith apple

40:32.900 --> 40:36.020
and little codes for Fortnite skins.

40:36.020 --> 40:38.500
Kids, come on into Cool Greens.

40:38.500 --> 40:41.540
We know where to buy drugs.

40:41.540 --> 40:44.020
Some day, historians will look back on this bit

40:44.020 --> 40:50.020
and note how easily we could summon up things that are cool

40:50.020 --> 40:52.420
and how hard we stumbled and fought

40:52.420 --> 40:54.100
to come up with salad ingredients.

40:54.100 --> 40:59.300
I did hear raisins in there, I think.

40:59.300 --> 41:02.020
Raisins, it's a thing, but it's like not.

41:02.020 --> 41:02.820
You can do raisins, yeah.

41:02.820 --> 41:04.980
If the bit is like salad things,

41:04.980 --> 41:08.020
there is a list of about a hundred different things.

41:08.020 --> 41:09.060
Yeah, sure.

41:09.060 --> 41:10.580
No, don't get me wrong.

41:10.580 --> 41:11.540
No, don't get me wrong.

41:11.540 --> 41:13.700
Raisins is not a salad thing,

41:13.700 --> 41:15.940
but I wouldn't put it in the top 10.

41:17.780 --> 41:20.500
We could have had carrots or cucumbers or tomatoes,

41:20.500 --> 41:22.340
but we went with raisins.

41:22.340 --> 41:25.060
Survey says, oh, didn't make it on the board.

41:25.060 --> 41:32.500
This salad's got scrambled eggs and hot dog slices

41:32.500 --> 41:34.500
and cool pictures of Spider-Man.

41:37.860 --> 41:39.620
How about another question though?

41:39.620 --> 41:40.580
Yeah, I'd love that.

41:41.540 --> 41:42.900
Now I'm looking at all these salads

41:42.900 --> 41:44.580
and getting hungry for salad.

41:45.540 --> 41:47.620
You know how it goes for people like me.

41:48.740 --> 41:50.500
I work at a toy store that sells...

41:50.500 --> 41:52.420
That was a weird way of saying toy store.

41:52.980 --> 41:56.900
I work at a toy store that sells a variety of objects,

41:57.620 --> 42:00.420
including small colorful rocks and gems.

42:00.980 --> 42:04.340
The other day, an older man came up to me

42:04.900 --> 42:06.660
in the store with a panic look in his eyes.

42:06.660 --> 42:09.060
He ran up to me, dropped a giant wad of cash on the table

42:09.060 --> 42:12.820
and said, I have $150, how many rocks can I get?

42:14.100 --> 42:18.500
Due to this totaling out to a substantial amount of rocks,

42:18.500 --> 42:21.220
I had to grab my manager to help with the transaction.

42:21.220 --> 42:22.900
But when I came back, he was gone.

42:23.700 --> 42:26.420
If he comes back, what should I do in this situation?

42:26.420 --> 42:28.180
Why does he need so many rocks?

42:28.180 --> 42:30.260
I'm deeply concerned about the situation, brothers,

42:30.260 --> 42:31.540
and I really need some clarity.

42:33.300 --> 42:35.940
Yeah, that's from ill-fated encounter in Idaho.

42:35.940 --> 42:39.140
And it is for a slingshot fight.

42:40.180 --> 42:43.460
Oh, I was going to say time traveler.

42:44.100 --> 42:45.940
Time traveler does need rocks for the future.

42:45.940 --> 42:46.900
We've run out of rocks.

42:48.100 --> 42:50.180
Mars needs rocks.

42:50.180 --> 42:51.220
Mars needs rocks.

42:51.220 --> 42:53.220
And we did too many slingshot fights.

42:53.220 --> 42:56.340
We ran out, shot them all up, and they got out into space.

42:56.340 --> 42:59.380
And why do you need so many rocks?

42:59.380 --> 43:03.140
$150 worth of rocks is probably a lot of rocks, eh?

43:03.140 --> 43:04.260
A great deal of rocks.

43:04.260 --> 43:06.420
Maybe not like at a toy store.

43:06.420 --> 43:08.820
You could probably get a better sort of rock per dollar

43:08.820 --> 43:12.340
at a Home Depot or like the old quarry.

43:13.060 --> 43:13.540
Fuck that.

43:13.540 --> 43:15.300
At the quarry, you don't even need $150.

43:15.300 --> 43:16.900
Just go and take some rocks, bud.

43:16.900 --> 43:19.620
But those aren't prestige rocks, Griffin.

43:20.340 --> 43:21.700
Those are just dirty rocks.

43:21.700 --> 43:24.340
There has to be something about how prestigious these rocks are.

43:25.140 --> 43:28.340
The only thing I can imagine is this old man was at a party

43:28.340 --> 43:32.260
and said, I bet you all I have $150 worth of rocks.

43:32.260 --> 43:34.740
And they said, no way, Gene.

43:34.740 --> 43:37.300
And then he was like, I'll be right back.

43:37.300 --> 43:39.220
Because he was hoisting his own petard.

43:39.220 --> 43:41.300
You're suggesting he's been maybe turned away

43:41.300 --> 43:43.860
from every other rock store in the county

43:44.580 --> 43:47.140
and found out that they do have rocks at the toy store.

43:47.140 --> 43:48.500
They've blocked him at the quarry.

43:48.500 --> 43:50.260
They've blocked him at the Home Depot.

43:50.260 --> 43:51.220
And this is it for me.

43:51.220 --> 43:53.140
If you can't help me out, nobody can.

43:53.140 --> 43:57.940
The way I understand this question is that the old man

43:57.940 --> 43:59.700
left without buying the rocks.

43:59.700 --> 44:01.700
Is that how you all understand this question

44:01.700 --> 44:02.420
to have happened?

44:03.220 --> 44:03.860
Yes.

44:03.860 --> 44:04.820
That's terrible.

44:05.380 --> 44:06.820
That's a terrible thing.

44:06.820 --> 44:08.500
That's so many rocks.

44:08.500 --> 44:10.420
This person says, how should I handle

44:10.420 --> 44:11.860
this situation in the future?

44:12.580 --> 44:15.060
If this old man comes back, you should throw those rocks at him

44:15.060 --> 44:17.620
and say, hey, jerk wad.

44:17.620 --> 44:20.260
They don't pay me enough to haul these rocks around the store.

44:20.260 --> 44:22.820
I'm not a big buff rock hauling guy.

44:22.820 --> 44:25.300
Well, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

44:25.300 --> 44:25.860
They might be.

44:26.660 --> 44:26.980
OK.

44:27.620 --> 44:29.860
They might be big and jacked and crazy strong.

44:29.860 --> 44:30.900
Like big Debbie.

44:30.900 --> 44:31.860
Oh, my God.

44:31.860 --> 44:37.300
What if the old man's bet was, I bet that that clerk

44:38.020 --> 44:41.860
can carry $150 worth of rocks and gems.

44:42.900 --> 44:44.820
Ah, that old bar bet.

44:44.820 --> 44:47.540
The oldest one in the book.

44:47.540 --> 44:52.820
I bet that person can carry $150 worth of gems and rocks.

44:53.460 --> 44:55.460
The only thing I can assume is that this person,

44:55.460 --> 44:58.420
this old man, needed these rocks for some nefarious purpose.

44:58.420 --> 45:01.860
Otherwise, when you said I have to go get my manager,

45:01.860 --> 45:04.500
then old man must have thought like, ah, the jig is up

45:04.500 --> 45:06.580
and like run out of the store.

45:06.580 --> 45:09.460
Oh, they probably robbed you.

45:09.460 --> 45:10.660
Oh, yeah, right.

45:10.660 --> 45:11.940
OK, they robbed you.

45:11.940 --> 45:13.940
I need to buy $150 worth of rocks.

45:13.940 --> 45:15.780
Can you run a quick calculation?

45:15.780 --> 45:17.060
Oh, you got to talk to your manager?

45:17.060 --> 45:18.420
Yeah, go ahead and head to the back room.

45:18.420 --> 45:19.060
I'll wait.

45:19.700 --> 45:23.780
Smash, grab, loot, loot, loot, steal, steal, steal, take, take,

45:23.780 --> 45:24.900
take, mine, mine, mine.

45:24.900 --> 45:25.380
Bye bye.

45:25.380 --> 45:27.940
What do you think old man Gene took, Griffin?

45:30.340 --> 45:31.700
Hundreds of dollars?

45:31.700 --> 45:32.660
Why are you suggesting?

45:33.620 --> 45:35.060
Because he's aged?

45:36.500 --> 45:39.060
He stole a bunch of checkers sets, Trav.

45:39.060 --> 45:42.340
No, he took cold hard cash, bud.

45:42.340 --> 45:44.340
I was just going to say maybe he took some rocks.

45:44.340 --> 45:45.300
I didn't realize what you were talking about.

45:45.300 --> 45:46.980
He did steal some rocks on the side.

45:46.980 --> 45:49.380
He said, now that I've said that, I know it was a ruse,

45:49.380 --> 45:51.700
but I would actually like some cool rocks.

45:52.660 --> 45:53.700
I do like rocks.

45:53.700 --> 45:55.380
I do like rocks.

45:55.380 --> 45:57.060
My nephew loves rocks.

45:57.060 --> 45:58.820
My nephew loves these things.

45:58.820 --> 46:00.260
So this is going to be a gift for him.

46:00.260 --> 46:05.060
The $1,200 is a gift for me for the drug party

46:05.060 --> 46:05.780
I'm having tonight.

46:07.700 --> 46:09.460
Giant fish tank, maybe.

46:10.020 --> 46:12.500
Maybe he was like, I got to buy a giant fish tank.

46:12.500 --> 46:14.420
And it was, and then like halfway through he's like,

46:14.420 --> 46:16.900
I'll never, I travel too much.

46:16.900 --> 46:18.340
Who's going to feed these fish?

46:18.340 --> 46:20.180
Anyway, I'll just leave these rocks here.

46:20.180 --> 46:21.220
I have other things to do.

46:21.860 --> 46:23.300
I don't know why he'd be panicked though.

46:23.300 --> 46:25.220
If he needed to fill up a giant fish tank.

46:25.220 --> 46:26.340
Unless the fish were.

46:26.340 --> 46:27.460
He had a date coming over.

46:28.020 --> 46:30.980
And the guy that was coming over loved fish.

46:32.180 --> 46:34.980
He was like, oh, my tank, it's a big one.

46:34.980 --> 46:36.260
Let me just put it.

46:36.260 --> 46:38.260
I don't want to get into cubic footage,

46:38.260 --> 46:40.340
but it's a big tank, so.

46:41.620 --> 46:44.500
Or maybe the fish were already in the tank

46:44.500 --> 46:46.420
and before he could put the water in there,

46:46.420 --> 46:48.260
obviously you got to put the rocks in.

46:48.260 --> 46:51.140
So time is of the essence.

46:51.140 --> 46:52.660
And then it took so long, he's like,

46:52.660 --> 46:53.940
well, they're probably dead.

46:53.940 --> 46:54.740
They're dead now.

46:54.740 --> 46:55.300
They're dead now.

46:55.300 --> 46:56.580
I'm going to go home and start again.

46:57.140 --> 46:59.060
There's no way I'll impress that date now.

47:00.180 --> 47:02.420
Unless he likes dead fish.

47:02.420 --> 47:04.500
Unless he likes dead beta fish.

47:05.140 --> 47:06.980
Does he just like the idea of fish?

47:06.980 --> 47:08.820
Does he have to see them swimming around?

47:08.820 --> 47:09.300
We'll see.

47:11.940 --> 47:14.180
Uh, help me brothers.

47:14.180 --> 47:16.980
I really have to have a Tuesday.

47:16.980 --> 47:17.220
What?

47:17.860 --> 47:19.140
Like a number two.

47:19.140 --> 47:20.340
It has to poop.

47:20.340 --> 47:22.740
Oh, I don't know.

47:22.740 --> 47:23.620
You got any other ones?

47:27.860 --> 47:29.140
No, come on, let's do it.

47:29.140 --> 47:30.660
This is like Pee Wee Herman not wanting

47:30.660 --> 47:32.100
to get the snakes out of the pet shop.

47:32.100 --> 47:32.660
Come on, bud.

47:32.660 --> 47:34.260
All right, let's get the snakes out of the pet shop.

47:34.900 --> 47:36.340
But everyone in the office has already

47:36.340 --> 47:37.460
seen me walk across the room,

47:37.460 --> 47:38.180
go into the bathroom,

47:38.180 --> 47:40.020
see the one stall is occupied,

47:40.020 --> 47:42.020
and just walk back to my desk twice.

47:42.020 --> 47:43.780
The walls are closing in on me.

47:43.780 --> 47:46.740
Do I risk my third hurried walk to the lavatory

47:46.740 --> 47:48.980
through the thicket of judgmental glances

47:48.980 --> 47:50.580
from my co-workers?

47:50.580 --> 47:51.860
What's the play?

47:51.860 --> 47:52.420
Gmail.

47:53.380 --> 47:53.860
What?

47:53.860 --> 47:56.100
Okay, what's your other option

47:56.100 --> 47:59.540
other than risking the hurried walk to the lavatory?

47:59.540 --> 48:01.460
Yeah, do you want us to look you in the email

48:01.460 --> 48:02.580
and say poop your pants?

48:02.580 --> 48:04.740
Because we're not going to do it.

48:04.740 --> 48:05.700
It's not going to happen.

48:05.700 --> 48:06.820
Not here, friendo.

48:08.100 --> 48:11.620
I mean, you fucked up by not having a dead drop location.

48:11.620 --> 48:14.340
I always have a fucking dead drop location.

48:14.340 --> 48:15.220
I always do.

48:15.220 --> 48:15.940
Are you kidding me?

48:15.940 --> 48:18.580
I was in the H-E-B and I had to use the restroom

48:18.580 --> 48:20.180
quite badly and I went in the restroom

48:20.180 --> 48:20.980
and somebody was in there.

48:20.980 --> 48:22.180
I waited two minutes.

48:22.180 --> 48:23.380
They were still in there.

48:23.380 --> 48:25.060
And so I knew to just walk outside,

48:25.060 --> 48:26.580
go to the Thai restaurant next door

48:26.580 --> 48:27.700
and blast off in there

48:27.700 --> 48:28.740
and then come back to H-E-B,

48:28.740 --> 48:29.860
get my shopping done.

48:29.860 --> 48:31.460
You got to have a dead drop everywhere.

48:31.460 --> 48:33.220
Are you fucking new?

48:33.220 --> 48:34.740
You got to have a dead drop.

48:37.780 --> 48:40.180
It also helps if you tie some kind of bell

48:40.180 --> 48:41.540
or something to the bathroom door.

48:42.100 --> 48:44.260
So that way you can hear someone come in and out

48:44.260 --> 48:47.940
and then you can wait the appropriate 45 seconds to a minute,

48:47.940 --> 48:49.460
walk over casually like,

48:49.460 --> 48:50.740
might as well check,

48:50.740 --> 48:51.940
see if anyone's in here.

48:51.940 --> 48:52.740
Oh, empty.

48:52.740 --> 48:53.620
I could go.

48:53.620 --> 48:56.660
I can make a real cash kind of thing.

48:56.660 --> 49:00.500
I've had to do this with Rachel,

49:00.500 --> 49:02.580
sometimes I'm with one of you two.

49:02.580 --> 49:05.380
If we've stayed together in a hotel or on tour,

49:05.380 --> 49:06.820
this idea of you're in the bathroom,

49:06.820 --> 49:07.540
maybe taking a shower,

49:07.540 --> 49:08.660
maybe using the bathroom

49:08.660 --> 49:09.860
and I really have to do it.

49:09.860 --> 49:12.660
And then I call out,

49:12.660 --> 49:14.740
I plead to you,

49:14.740 --> 49:17.860
hey, I really, really,

49:17.860 --> 49:19.300
I'm so sorry.

49:19.300 --> 49:20.580
I know that I don't want to be pushy,

49:20.580 --> 49:21.780
but I really need to get up in.

49:22.580 --> 49:25.220
I've never, I don't think done that with a stranger,

49:25.220 --> 49:27.140
but I'm wondering if maybe that's like,

49:27.140 --> 49:28.980
it's a common enough human experience

49:28.980 --> 49:30.180
that if a stranger did it to me,

49:30.180 --> 49:33.620
I would blast off as fast as I could.

49:33.620 --> 49:36.580
Could you just wander in and out

49:36.580 --> 49:37.780
just saying stuff like,

49:38.740 --> 49:39.620
just like,

49:39.620 --> 49:41.460
where are my damn glasses?

49:41.460 --> 49:44.180
Gosh darn it,

49:44.180 --> 49:46.340
I really want to find my glasses.

49:46.340 --> 49:47.140
Man alive.

49:47.140 --> 49:48.100
I can't believe it.

49:48.100 --> 49:48.820
Darn the luck.

49:49.380 --> 49:51.140
And you just keep going in and out like,

49:51.140 --> 49:52.420
and it's like the door's closed.

49:52.420 --> 49:54.580
You can't go in where you think you left the glass.

49:54.580 --> 49:57.620
I am almost positive I left my darn glasses

49:57.620 --> 49:59.460
right in the dank mode.

49:59.460 --> 50:01.700
And I just need to get in there and look around.

50:01.700 --> 50:02.980
I bet they're in there.

50:02.980 --> 50:04.820
And that's why you keep ducking in and out

50:04.820 --> 50:06.740
because you've been looking for your darn glasses.

50:07.460 --> 50:09.380
Oh, and now we have them in your pocket.

50:09.380 --> 50:10.900
So when you finally use the bathroom,

50:10.900 --> 50:12.580
you come out like, found them.

50:12.580 --> 50:13.060
Found them.

50:13.060 --> 50:14.420
But you're going to be walking different.

50:14.420 --> 50:15.300
Everybody's going to know.

50:15.300 --> 50:16.820
That's why I think you should just be like,

50:17.620 --> 50:19.060
I got to blast off my ass

50:19.060 --> 50:21.380
and somebody has been in there the whole time, gang.

50:21.380 --> 50:22.820
And they'll look at you and be like,

50:22.820 --> 50:25.060
I know that feel, partner.

50:25.060 --> 50:26.100
It is pretty universal.

50:26.100 --> 50:26.900
If somebody said like,

50:26.900 --> 50:28.420
hey, the reason I keep checking the bathroom

50:28.420 --> 50:29.380
is because I need to use it

50:29.380 --> 50:30.180
and there's someone in there.

50:30.180 --> 50:31.300
I'd be like, yeah.

50:31.300 --> 50:33.460
Yeah, partner, I know that feel.

50:33.460 --> 50:35.300
We've literally all been there.

50:35.300 --> 50:37.620
Yeah, why are you announcing it?

50:37.620 --> 50:38.260
Like, why are you?

50:38.820 --> 50:39.860
Yeah, that's fine.

50:39.860 --> 50:41.220
We're all just people.

50:41.220 --> 50:42.100
We get it.

50:42.100 --> 50:42.740
We get it.

50:42.740 --> 50:44.580
My face win.

50:44.580 --> 50:45.940
I also have to blast off my ass,

50:45.940 --> 50:47.220
but someone's in the stall.

50:47.220 --> 50:47.460
Shoot.

50:48.260 --> 50:50.580
Is that what the problem is?

50:50.580 --> 50:51.540
Is that what the problem is?

50:51.540 --> 50:51.940
Because it's like,

50:53.140 --> 50:54.580
I was thinking about this on an airplane.

50:55.140 --> 50:56.500
They tell you not to pile up,

50:56.500 --> 50:58.100
not to like line up near the door,

50:58.740 --> 51:00.500
but you can't call dibsies.

51:00.500 --> 51:01.940
And if you stood up and said like,

51:01.940 --> 51:03.060
I need to do this,

51:03.940 --> 51:06.740
someone else in the plane might also say like,

51:06.740 --> 51:07.700
yeah, me too.

51:07.700 --> 51:09.780
And I guess we're just going to have a foot race.

51:09.780 --> 51:10.260
Aren't we?

51:10.260 --> 51:11.780
Because this is how it's going to shake out.

51:12.340 --> 51:15.060
If you announce that you have to use the bathroom,

51:15.060 --> 51:17.220
aren't you running the risk of somebody else being like,

51:17.220 --> 51:19.220
well, yeah, me too.

51:20.020 --> 51:21.460
Now that you mentioned it.

51:21.460 --> 51:21.780
Yeah.

51:21.780 --> 51:23.940
I'd love one right now.

51:23.940 --> 51:25.300
I'd love one.

51:25.300 --> 51:27.540
When we were on the plane this weekend,

51:28.500 --> 51:29.700
I was sitting next to Teresa,

51:29.700 --> 51:31.460
and I went to stand up and she said,

51:31.460 --> 51:34.020
oh, they asked people not to congregate around the door.

51:34.020 --> 51:34.820
And I was like, I know,

51:34.820 --> 51:37.780
but I'm standing up to establish like, I'm next.

51:37.780 --> 51:38.340
Yeah.

51:38.340 --> 51:40.740
You can't put your fucking quarter up

51:40.740 --> 51:43.700
on the airplane bathroom door.

51:44.660 --> 51:46.740
This is a gross way to end the show, maybe.

51:47.540 --> 51:49.140
No, I think it's a powerful way.

51:49.140 --> 51:50.580
No, can we talk about like a smart thing

51:50.580 --> 51:51.540
for like two seconds?

51:53.460 --> 51:53.940
Science.

51:57.140 --> 51:58.180
Munchquad Junior.

51:58.740 --> 51:59.940
Oh, there's another one.

51:59.940 --> 52:01.780
That's the great thing about Munchquad Junior

52:01.780 --> 52:07.540
is you can fit a bunch of them in a given episode.

52:07.540 --> 52:12.260
I just wanted to mention this is, again, fall is here.

52:12.980 --> 52:14.820
And another sign of the times

52:14.820 --> 52:16.420
that I just wanted to point to real quick

52:16.420 --> 52:22.420
is that Dairy Queen has launched their autumnal menu

52:23.780 --> 52:26.020
and the fall blizzards are here, folks.

52:26.660 --> 52:30.180
New this month, Dairy Queen snickerdoodle

52:30.180 --> 52:32.180
cookie dough blizzard treat,

52:32.180 --> 52:34.580
which has, you know, cookies and cinnamon

52:34.580 --> 52:37.780
and sugar and vanilla sauce.

52:37.780 --> 52:40.660
One that I'm not crazy about that kind of actually,

52:40.660 --> 52:44.740
frankly, it bothers me a little bit

52:45.300 --> 52:49.700
is the hot, the Oreo hot cocoa blizzard treat.

52:50.260 --> 52:53.300
A mix of Oreo cookie pieces and rich cocoa fudge

52:53.300 --> 52:55.540
hand blended with creamy vanilla soft serve

52:55.540 --> 52:57.300
that's finished with a whipped topping.

52:57.300 --> 53:04.100
And I just, it says from the quote from Maria Hockenson,

53:04.100 --> 53:07.220
who's the executive veep of marketing over there,

53:07.860 --> 53:09.940
set over at Berkshire Hathaway,

53:09.940 --> 53:11.700
the holding company that owns Dairy Queen.

53:11.700 --> 53:14.500
Yum, yum, who's hungry?

53:14.500 --> 53:18.980
From putting a unique twist on a treat

53:18.980 --> 53:22.660
that blends hot and cold in our Oreo hot cocoa blizzard treat.

53:22.660 --> 53:24.340
But the thing is you didn't,

53:24.340 --> 53:27.620
you didn't, and the thing is that it says hot in there

53:27.620 --> 53:30.020
and you didn't, and you didn't and you're lying.

53:30.020 --> 53:31.540
And that's just really bothers me

53:31.540 --> 53:33.140
because there's nothing hot about it.

53:33.140 --> 53:35.940
It's just, it's just, you just lied.

53:35.940 --> 53:37.460
And it's really bothers me.

53:37.460 --> 53:38.580
That's just cocoa.

53:38.580 --> 53:39.540
Yeah, it's just cocoa.

53:39.540 --> 53:41.060
There's no intervention there.

53:41.700 --> 53:43.300
They've got, intervention's a great word.

53:43.300 --> 53:45.860
They actually do have little sheets of plastic

53:45.860 --> 53:49.540
separating the hot fudge from the,

53:49.540 --> 53:51.460
it's like little pockets that's protected.

53:51.460 --> 53:54.500
They have these insular sort of pockets of hot fudge

53:54.500 --> 53:55.700
and you do need to watch out

53:55.700 --> 53:58.500
because that plastic, oh boy, it's a toxic one.

53:58.500 --> 54:01.700
My brother's one of the great minds of our time, Dairy Queen,

54:01.700 --> 54:04.660
and he's having a lot of fun, but you can have that idea.

54:04.660 --> 54:07.540
It's better than what you posted up, which was lying.

54:07.540 --> 54:09.220
It's nothing, it's nothing.

54:09.220 --> 54:13.380
You can't call a hot cocoa treat just for like fun,

54:13.380 --> 54:16.500
just to lie because it makes you feel strong.

54:16.500 --> 54:17.540
I don't understand,

54:17.540 --> 54:19.380
because you want to be better than Cold Stone.

54:19.380 --> 54:20.660
I don't fucking get it.

54:20.660 --> 54:21.460
It sucks.

54:21.460 --> 54:22.580
It makes me really angry.

54:22.580 --> 54:25.140
Anyway, Dairy Queen, Berkshire Hathaway,

54:25.140 --> 54:26.420
I still love y'all.

54:26.420 --> 54:28.820
Pumpkin Pie Blizzard, you know I'll be in for one of those.

54:28.820 --> 54:33.060
No question, but that's what's happening

54:33.060 --> 54:34.020
for the Fall Wizards.

54:34.980 --> 54:38.340
Folks, thank you so much for enjoying our program.

54:39.860 --> 54:42.900
We hope you had a great time.

54:44.500 --> 54:45.540
I want to personally-

54:45.540 --> 54:47.380
You sound like a normal human, Johnson.

54:47.380 --> 54:49.140
That's how people hope you do.

54:49.140 --> 54:51.060
I would like to ask you, this is the last episode

54:51.060 --> 54:53.060
I'm going to get a chance to ask you to do this,

54:53.060 --> 54:59.060
but if you could please pre-order the Sawbones book

54:59.060 --> 55:01.780
at bit.ly forward slash the Sawbones book.

55:02.580 --> 55:04.660
I wrote it with my wife and it was really hard

55:04.660 --> 55:07.860
and our publisher got sold to another company

55:07.860 --> 55:09.140
right when the book came out.

55:09.140 --> 55:11.140
So we're kind of doing this on our own,

55:11.140 --> 55:12.740
kind of trying to get people to buy it.

55:12.740 --> 55:16.900
So if you would buy it, it would just be the tops.

55:16.900 --> 55:18.180
It would just mean the world to me

55:18.180 --> 55:21.380
if you'd go to bit.ly forward slash the Sawbones book

55:21.380 --> 55:23.140
and pre-order that book.

55:23.140 --> 55:25.540
It comes out tomorrow, October 9th,

55:25.540 --> 55:27.940
or go to your bookstore and buy it there.

55:27.940 --> 55:30.740
That's great too if you want to do that,

55:30.740 --> 55:33.780
but I just really appreciate it and thank you so much.

55:35.220 --> 55:38.820
We have shows coming up in Denver and in Austin.

55:38.820 --> 55:42.020
You can get those tickets at mackereyshows.com slash tours.

55:43.620 --> 55:45.300
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters

55:45.300 --> 55:46.180
for the use of our theme song

55:46.180 --> 55:48.180
instead of partying off the album, putting the days to bed,

55:48.180 --> 55:48.900
which is so good.

55:48.900 --> 55:53.620
And thank you again, John, for playing us in in Seattle.

55:53.620 --> 55:54.260
That was awesome.

55:55.140 --> 55:57.860
And for once, I don't have a million things to plug,

55:57.860 --> 55:58.580
so we're good.

55:58.580 --> 55:59.080
Awesome.

56:00.740 --> 56:02.020
We can thank MaxFun for having us.

Our shit's at mackereyshows.com.

56:14.580 --> 56:15.700
Do you want to wrap it up?

56:15.700 --> 56:16.980
Oh wait, we do have one thing.

56:16.980 --> 56:18.100
We've got a new pin.

56:18.100 --> 56:20.020

56:32.580 --> 56:34.180

56:34.180 --> 56:34.820
so don't sleep.

56:35.940 --> 56:36.740
Here's the final Yahoo.

56:36.740 --> 56:37.860
It was sent in by a few folks.

56:37.860 --> 56:38.820
Thank you, everyone.

56:38.820 --> 56:41.940
It's from Yahoo Answers user Alexandra who asks,

56:41.940 --> 56:45.060
what's a better name for a moth, Timothy or Peter?

56:45.060 --> 56:52.180
I'm Travis McElroy.

56:52.180 --> 56:53.140
I'm Griffin McElroy.

56:53.140 --> 56:54.180
You're my brother, my brother and me.

56:54.180 --> 57:15.380
I'm Griffin McElroy.

Artist owned.

57:19.460 --> 57:20.660
Listener supported.

57:20.660 --> 57:22.980
Are you tired of trying to keep up with the news cycle?

57:22.980 --> 57:25.700
Is bad stuff happening too fast for you to process?

57:25.700 --> 57:27.540
Don't you wish there was an easy way to find out

57:27.540 --> 57:30.180
about only the most important info you need?

57:30.180 --> 57:33.220
Hi, we're Lisa and Emily.

57:34.100 --> 57:36.420
Why don't you try our podcast, Baby Geniuses?

57:36.420 --> 57:38.020
On each episode of our podcast,

57:38.020 --> 57:40.580
we discuss a weird Wikipedia page such as

57:40.580 --> 57:43.300
Flatulence Humor, Clamato, Catalan Witches,

57:43.300 --> 57:45.300
Clippy, the Microsoft Office Helper,

57:45.300 --> 57:47.060
Death during Consensual Sex,

57:47.060 --> 57:48.660
and The Talking Mongoose.

57:49.220 --> 57:51.140
We ask each other stupid questions.

57:51.140 --> 57:57.140
Uh, if you got a packet with like 300 seeds in it,

57:57.140 --> 58:00.500
what kind of plant would you choose the seeds to be?

58:03.700 --> 58:07.300
That felt like you were assigned to ask me a question

58:07.300 --> 58:09.780
and there were certain words you weren't allowed to use.

58:09.780 --> 58:11.700
We talk about Martha Stewart, her pony,

58:11.700 --> 58:13.540
and other celebrity horse news.

58:13.540 --> 58:14.100
