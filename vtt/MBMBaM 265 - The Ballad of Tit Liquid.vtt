00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:46.080
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother My Brother,

00:46.080 --> 00:50.400
a media advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.400
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.400 --> 00:55.040
I'm your baby-est baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:55.040 --> 00:59.120
Start spreading the news.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.400
Oh, that's good, that's good.

01:00.400 --> 01:02.080
I'm leaving today.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.640
This is Travis down in the corner of your screen.

01:06.640 --> 01:10.080
You've probably noticed Justin sounds a little bit different, and he's singing.

01:10.080 --> 01:15.360
Well, Justin has made his way to New York City, the Big Apple.

01:15.360 --> 01:17.360
The Big Snapple, even.

01:17.360 --> 01:18.720
The Big Snapple.

01:18.720 --> 01:20.640
The stars, they're in his eyes.

01:20.640 --> 01:26.080
His dreams are finally coming through, and he's decided to pursue his dreams of stardom.

01:26.080 --> 01:30.880
Of joining the great white way.

01:30.880 --> 01:33.520
He wants to be the whitest person on the white way.

01:33.520 --> 01:35.280
It's up to you.

01:35.280 --> 01:36.240
If anyone can do it.

01:36.240 --> 01:38.400
Justin, Justin, let me stop you right there, it sounds good.

01:38.400 --> 01:41.120
Don't use it all up, use it all up.

01:41.120 --> 01:43.760
I gotta know, have you prepared a tight two?

01:44.880 --> 01:50.880
Yeah, I have a monologue, I have a comedic, and I have-

01:50.880 --> 01:56.080
I'm not asking about your monologues, I wanna know if you've prepared a tight two for me.

01:56.080 --> 02:00.960
If not, turn on your heels, do a plie on your heels, and get the fuck out of here.

02:00.960 --> 02:06.160
I have two contrasting monologues, one is comedic, one is dramatic.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.960
I didn't ask you about your monologues, do you have two?

02:08.960 --> 02:10.720
I wanna hear you sing two notes.

02:11.440 --> 02:13.520
Oh, two notes?

02:13.520 --> 02:20.960
Uh, tight two notes, and I- you bet, you only got two, so blow me.

02:20.960 --> 02:22.160
Okay, okay.

02:24.320 --> 02:26.240
Sarah, me.

02:26.240 --> 02:28.240
There, no, that's it, that was perfect.

02:28.240 --> 02:29.040
Thank you.

02:29.040 --> 02:31.360
Now we can move on to the monologue phase of the audition.

02:31.360 --> 02:34.480
Hold on one second before we move on to the monologue phase of the audition.

02:34.480 --> 02:37.040
Jeffrey, Steven, get out of here, you're done.

02:38.240 --> 02:39.600
You're done, get out of here.

02:39.600 --> 02:40.960
Your twos were too loose.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.600
You got loose twos.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.080
You got loose twos, get the hell out of here.

02:47.200 --> 02:48.640
Michael, get them out of here.

02:49.680 --> 02:52.240
Michael Cerveris, get them out.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.560
I had to get Michael Cerveris to throw them the hell out of here,

02:54.560 --> 02:56.640
right on their ear, right onto the Great White Way,

02:56.640 --> 02:58.960
and it's made out of gravel, so it's gonna hurt their ears.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.200
Huntington, West Virginia's own Michael Cerveris, our favorite son,

03:03.920 --> 03:06.640
our favorite Broadway star, who's also the observer.

03:06.640 --> 03:09.280
He's here, and he's here to give you some encouragement.

03:09.280 --> 03:11.280
Do it for us, Justin.

03:11.280 --> 03:15.360
Mark McVay, I should mention, is also a Huntington beloved.

03:15.360 --> 03:16.480
Yeah, I'm here too.

03:16.480 --> 03:17.680
It's me, Mark McVay, Justin.

03:17.680 --> 03:18.560
Mark McVay.

03:18.560 --> 03:21.200
And I'm your sister, Beth McVay.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.800
Oh boy, and let me just tell you,

03:22.800 --> 03:26.480
you got the tightest two I've experienced ever.

03:26.480 --> 03:29.520
You've been working out to get your two that tight?

03:29.520 --> 03:31.120
Yeah, tight ass twos.

03:31.120 --> 03:32.480
None of this is right.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.720
None of these character voices are correct.

03:34.720 --> 03:37.040
All right, Justin, hit me with those monos, my boy.

03:37.040 --> 03:42.720
Okay, I have prepared three monologues, a comedic, a dramatic, and a...

03:44.880 --> 03:45.840
I love it.

03:45.840 --> 03:46.400
I love it.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.680
I love your voice, I love your style, I love your tight little body.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.680
And a classical monologue.

03:52.640 --> 04:03.920
So my dramatic monologue is from a really super duper serious part

04:04.560 --> 04:06.640
of 10 Things I Hate About You.

04:06.640 --> 04:06.960
Okay.

04:06.960 --> 04:11.520
My comedic monologue is from a sort of a funnier part

04:12.080 --> 04:13.600
in 10 Things I Hate About You.

04:13.600 --> 04:18.720
And my classic monologue is, of course, from 10 Things I Hate About You,

04:18.720 --> 04:20.640
which is based on Tammy of the Shrew.

04:20.640 --> 04:24.080
So I have sort of all the range of...

04:24.080 --> 04:27.200
Perfect, perfect film, perfect trio, perfect triad.

04:27.200 --> 04:30.800
I tell you what though, I only want to hear your favorite of the three

04:30.800 --> 04:32.640
because we've only got an hour.

04:32.640 --> 04:38.560
So this is the scene, of course, when Julia Stiles is talking to-

04:38.560 --> 04:39.120
I love her.

04:39.120 --> 04:39.920
I found her.

04:39.920 --> 04:43.440
I picked her from the briar patch, put her up on that great white way.

04:43.440 --> 04:44.720
I adopted her and I raised her.

04:44.720 --> 04:45.600
She was sick.

04:45.600 --> 04:49.600
She had two broken arms and legs, four broken limbs total,

04:49.600 --> 04:51.360
and I nursed her back to health from my breast.

04:52.480 --> 04:54.960
I've prepared just a short selection from one scene

04:54.960 --> 04:59.760
when Julia Stiles is talking to, as Cat Stratford is talking to Cameron James,

04:59.760 --> 05:03.200
played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, which I would- Breastfed him too.

05:03.200 --> 05:03.680
Go on.

05:03.680 --> 05:04.960
Breastfed him too.

05:04.960 --> 05:05.360
Okay.

05:05.360 --> 05:09.840
I'd just like to jump into the scene from 10 Things I Hate About You right now.

05:09.840 --> 05:13.760
It's a short scene, but hopefully you're going to enjoy it.

05:13.760 --> 05:14.720
Spin it up, baby.

05:14.720 --> 05:15.220
Okay.

05:18.400 --> 05:23.200
Number seven, the way you order at restaurants.

05:23.920 --> 05:27.120
Number eight, your stupid hair.

05:27.120 --> 05:27.840
Yes, of course.

05:27.840 --> 05:28.160
Sorry.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.960
I want to tell you 10 things I loved about that.

05:33.360 --> 05:33.920
Everything.

05:36.880 --> 05:37.520
That's one.

05:39.360 --> 05:43.440
Now, Justin, I got to tell you, you got the perfect look for the part we're casting today,

05:43.440 --> 05:50.400
which is, of course, Jeff-ya on a new musical that we've written together.

05:50.400 --> 05:53.200
Me and Travis have written together called Fiddler on the Ground.

05:54.800 --> 05:57.120
We had a lot of insurance issues.

05:57.120 --> 05:57.840
We did.

05:57.840 --> 06:00.000
He was really super high up there.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.520
Listen, I'm going to be honest with you because I feel like honesty is the most important part

06:03.520 --> 06:05.840
in a director-actor relationship.

06:05.840 --> 06:07.600
We've lost a few Jeff-yas.

06:07.600 --> 06:08.240
They've fallen.

06:08.240 --> 06:11.600
They have done plump fell right the fuck off that roof right onto the-

06:11.600 --> 06:12.720
Why were they on a roof?

06:14.720 --> 06:18.560
Why is there a roof in your sequel, Fiddler on the Ground?

06:18.560 --> 06:20.080
No, that's what I'm saying.

06:21.280 --> 06:22.160
We've adapted.

06:22.160 --> 06:22.880
I'm going to be honest.

06:22.880 --> 06:26.640
It's note for note, word for word, exactly the same, except for all references to roofs

06:26.640 --> 06:31.600
have been struck from the record, and it's a much more terrestrial production.

06:31.600 --> 06:39.200
This is sort of like when they changed Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark to Underwear Man,

06:39.200 --> 06:44.320
the punching genius, so they got rid of all the swinging, and it was just a man in his

06:44.320 --> 06:49.120
underwear, in his long underwear, punching people, and he was great at it.

06:49.120 --> 06:50.000
Exactly.

06:50.000 --> 06:56.480
Now, Justin, real quick, before we give you the part, and I am right on the edge.

06:56.480 --> 06:56.720
Right on the edge.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.240
We got a lot more people to see.

06:58.240 --> 07:02.800
I want to ask you the same question I ask every Jeff-ya in Fiddler on the Roof, and

07:02.800 --> 07:03.600
that is this.

07:03.600 --> 07:04.800
Sorry, Fiddler on the Ground.

07:04.800 --> 07:05.520
He is on the ground.

07:05.520 --> 07:07.920
Fiddler on the Ground, can you shake it?

07:09.520 --> 07:12.720
Yeah, my problem is trying not to break it.

07:12.720 --> 07:15.840
That's my problem is I could shake it, shake it, but then when I try not to break it-

07:15.840 --> 07:19.760
Well, we have had insurance issues, so we do need you to guarantee that you will not

07:19.760 --> 07:20.320
break it.

07:20.320 --> 07:24.640
I have to tell you that it's actually very disappointing, Justin, because all of the

07:24.640 --> 07:30.720
Jeff-yas we've had so far have exhibited proclivity toward breaking it, it being everything.

07:30.720 --> 07:34.080
I do have experience with this sort of Broadway production.

07:35.760 --> 07:41.040
I don't know if you saw, it was a very limited run called Into the Weeds because the trees

07:41.040 --> 07:47.280
kept falling on people, so they got rid of those, and it was just tall grass where people

07:47.280 --> 07:49.200
learn things about fairy tales and life.

07:49.200 --> 07:57.040
We did a production of Who's Afraid of Virginia Puppy because the wolves, we had a really

07:57.040 --> 08:00.000
hard time controlling the wolf on stage.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.440
So we just replaced-

08:01.440 --> 08:08.960
I was in a production called Some Things Goes because we had a lot of problem with some

08:08.960 --> 08:13.840
substance abuse and a lot of pregnancies, and then we had to say, okay, not anything

08:13.840 --> 08:14.560
goes.

08:14.560 --> 08:15.600
Some Things Goes.

08:15.600 --> 08:19.280
Hey, hey, the subtitle, Some Things Goes, hey, hey, keep your dick in your pants.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.600
I produced the Spider-Man musical.

08:23.600 --> 08:27.200
Travis produced the Spider-Man musical, but back in the original days when it was good,

08:27.200 --> 08:29.920
when it was risky, when it was brave, when it was deadly.

08:31.040 --> 08:33.360
When it starred the Flying Walensky brothers.

08:33.360 --> 08:34.880
Oh, that was a thrilling production, I bet.

08:34.880 --> 08:35.920
Is that who that is?

08:35.920 --> 08:37.520
Who are those people?

08:37.520 --> 08:41.120
Listen, I just want to get out of here and I want to say, you got the job, but unfortunately

08:41.120 --> 08:42.160
theater is dead.

08:42.160 --> 08:42.880
Theater is dead.

08:42.880 --> 08:45.280
No, a theater can't be dead.

08:45.840 --> 08:46.880
Just died.

08:46.880 --> 08:47.360
Just died.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.360
Well, it died along with the third Spider-Man.

08:49.360 --> 08:52.320
Oh no, we lost another one?

08:52.320 --> 08:56.080
Well, we lost 16, but after the third one is when we really had to rein it in.

08:56.080 --> 09:02.480
I was in a production called Singing in the Fog because there's a lot of slipping and

09:02.480 --> 09:04.560
a lot of people were falling and that was-

09:04.560 --> 09:05.760
I remember I was there.

09:05.760 --> 09:07.280
I was in the third row.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.960
I got really great seats for opening night.

09:08.960 --> 09:09.760
Couldn't see a thing.

09:10.320 --> 09:10.640
Right.

09:10.640 --> 09:11.680
I loved it.

09:11.680 --> 09:13.040
I loved it though.

09:13.040 --> 09:15.600
It's very conceptual, very sexual.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.680
It was the sexiest production since Some Things Go.

09:17.680 --> 09:19.520
It was very conceptual.

09:19.520 --> 09:20.880
It was conceptual, I would say.

09:22.880 --> 09:24.960
There was also, there was one other I was in.

09:25.520 --> 09:28.240
There had a lot of issues with shootings on stage.

09:28.240 --> 09:31.520
It was Annie Get Your Nerf Crossbow.

09:31.520 --> 09:32.080
Yeah, sure.

09:32.080 --> 09:36.560
And that was not, that was soundly, critically drubbed, I would say.

09:37.280 --> 09:38.560
And Tom Lopat.

09:38.560 --> 09:43.840
Now, I saw one called, it was called Paint Your Wagon, but hey, watch it with the lead

09:43.840 --> 09:44.960
based stuff, partner.

09:44.960 --> 09:45.440
Yeah, sure.

09:45.440 --> 09:46.960
Because they did have a lot of-

09:46.960 --> 09:51.360
Paint Your Wagon bright yellow so we can see it coming so no one gets run over anymore.

09:52.160 --> 09:52.400
Right.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.920
Okay, so I guess we should start the podcast.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.440
This is, as you've certainly gathered-

09:57.440 --> 09:58.000
I saw one.

09:58.880 --> 09:59.520
I saw one.

09:59.520 --> 10:00.160
No, hold on.

10:00.160 --> 10:05.440
I saw one and it was just called Juliet because the catalyst for that whole thing was their

10:05.440 --> 10:06.000
romance.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.440
Just take that out of the equation and it's just nice play about some family stuff.

10:10.480 --> 10:14.720
A lot of parents were complaining about the fan of being too spooky so I mounted the guy

10:14.720 --> 10:16.080
in the sheet in the opera.

10:16.080 --> 10:16.880
Under the sheet, though.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.560
Under the sheet, horribly burned.

10:18.560 --> 10:20.720
Oh my god, head to dick.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.000
Just burned all the way up.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.120
All right, so are we ready to-

10:26.480 --> 10:29.520
Like a tempura eggplant, just completely burned.

10:29.520 --> 10:30.960
That's really bad, okay.

10:30.960 --> 10:34.720
My girlfriend and I are about to embark on a cross-country move, Washington, D.C. to

10:34.720 --> 10:35.440
Seattle.

10:35.440 --> 10:40.320
We're excited about the trip but the prospect of 50 hours in the car is a daunting one.

10:40.320 --> 10:45.120
What are some things we can do while we drive to keep ourselves from going totally bonkers?

10:45.120 --> 10:46.480
That's from trapped in a Toyota.

10:46.480 --> 10:50.640
Now, Travis, I would guess you probably have the most experience of the three of us with

10:50.640 --> 10:52.000
like super long hauls.

10:53.680 --> 11:00.560
Yeah, I mean, real talk, the best thing I can advise is like make yourself stop for

11:00.560 --> 11:01.520
like meals.

11:01.520 --> 11:05.360
Teresa and I got into a bad habit of like kind of going, oh, we'll stop the next place

11:05.360 --> 11:05.920
we see.

11:05.920 --> 11:07.120
Oh, are you really hungry?

11:07.120 --> 11:11.040
And then pretty soon like we'd miss lunch and it'd be like three o'clock and that

11:11.040 --> 11:14.160
just makes you really crabby and makes you like really like, eh.

11:14.160 --> 11:19.920
So like eat at regular times and also at a certain point, I'm the type of person who

11:19.920 --> 11:24.000
always likes to make good time on a drive, but at a certain point if you're driving,

11:24.000 --> 11:28.080
you know, 50 collective hours, schedule in breaks.

11:28.080 --> 11:31.680
Like say like, you know, every two and a half hours we're going to get out and stretch our

11:31.680 --> 11:32.560
legs or something.

11:32.560 --> 11:37.680
Because man, sitting in the car even for like six hours knowing you have like another four

11:37.680 --> 11:42.960
or five hours in the day and then another 40 after that, it can get pretty mind numbing.

11:45.440 --> 11:50.320
I kind of love taking trips like in a plane or in a car, as long as I'm not driving.

11:50.320 --> 11:51.280
Driving is kind of a bummer.

11:51.280 --> 11:54.160
Then like the only thing you can do is listen to podcasts and guess what?

11:54.160 --> 11:55.520
Dummy already doing that.

11:55.520 --> 12:01.120
Um, but if you're not driving, I mean, that is why God made Pokemon like that.

12:01.120 --> 12:06.800
Like I get psyched to get on a plane and like, oh shit, time to fire up, fire up the Game

12:06.800 --> 12:07.280
Boy.

12:07.280 --> 12:10.960
I say Game Boy there is like sort of a catch all for all handheld gaming consoles.

12:10.960 --> 12:11.760
Sure, sure.

12:11.760 --> 12:12.800
Have you heard of Pokemon?

12:12.800 --> 12:15.680
Because it's going to change you on the road.

12:15.680 --> 12:18.560
You think what this person needs is Pokemon.

12:18.560 --> 12:19.920
Yeah, it's hard to know where to start.

12:19.920 --> 12:21.040
I really like X and Y.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.360
Um, no, you got to start old school.

12:23.360 --> 12:25.520
You got to start red and blue.

12:25.520 --> 12:26.240
Well, that's what I'm saying.

12:26.240 --> 12:30.080
I think X and Y did a pretty good job of including maybe the people who haven't played it before.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.960
It's a pretty good entry point, for being honest.

12:32.960 --> 12:38.240
Uh, you, I mean, you probably don't want to, uh, you probably don't want to do this if

12:38.240 --> 12:39.040
you're driving though.

12:39.040 --> 12:43.440
I mean, I, I think that that's kind of a crummy move in a two person long haul.

12:43.440 --> 12:47.360
If one person fires up the Game Boy, I think you take turns, you take turns driving and

12:47.360 --> 12:49.120
then it's like, what move should I use?

12:49.120 --> 12:49.600
Yeah.

12:49.600 --> 12:50.320
What do you want me to use?

12:50.320 --> 12:50.800
Razor Leaf?

12:50.800 --> 12:51.920
No, don't use Razor Leaf.

12:51.920 --> 12:54.320
No, don't use Razor Leaf, you're fighting a Charizard.

12:54.320 --> 12:55.200
Idiot.

12:55.200 --> 12:55.760
Idiot.

12:55.760 --> 12:56.720
Get out of the car.

12:56.720 --> 12:57.920
I'm going alone now.

12:57.920 --> 13:00.960
I knew I should have gone alone this whole, leave the 3DS though.

13:00.960 --> 13:02.160
Leave the 3DS.

13:02.160 --> 13:04.080
Start to set it on the dashboard.

13:04.080 --> 13:04.960
Set it on the dashboard.

13:04.960 --> 13:06.480
We're three badges deep, Debra.

13:06.480 --> 13:07.440
Get the hell out of here.

13:09.600 --> 13:14.560
Uh, I'm assuming if you're going to Seattle, you're basically just driving to see our live

13:14.560 --> 13:15.440
show there.

13:15.440 --> 13:20.320
Uh, bit.ly forward slash n-b-n-b-a-m Seattle, uh, for tickets.

13:20.320 --> 13:22.000
Still plenty of great seats available.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.040
Next week.

13:23.040 --> 13:25.360
That's inadvis- oh my god, don't put it like that.

13:25.360 --> 13:27.040
Hahaha, it's next week, what's up?

13:27.040 --> 13:27.760
God, you suck.

13:28.480 --> 13:30.960
Um, that's not because I'm not looking forward to it.

13:30.960 --> 13:33.360
I think it's going to be off the chain and off the hook.

13:33.360 --> 13:39.920
Um, maybe, maybe, uh, enjoy the scenery as you drive across this great land of ours.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.280
You're going to see a lot of stuff.

13:41.280 --> 13:46.080
A lot of deserts, maybe mountains, maybe Grand Canyon or you could miss the Grand Canyon

13:46.080 --> 13:46.640
like I did.

13:46.640 --> 13:50.320
Or you could stop at every Cracker Barrel you see, even if you're not hungry.

13:50.320 --> 13:54.800
Even if you just stopped at a Cracker Barrel two hours before and buy a licorice candy

13:54.800 --> 13:57.280
in every Cracker Barrel in the United States.

13:57.280 --> 13:58.000
Oh, that's fun.

13:59.040 --> 14:02.240
And then you could maybe get, like, a, um, book on tape.

14:02.240 --> 14:04.720
I recommend the Q continuum.

14:04.720 --> 14:08.880
It was a great one our dad made us listen to a couple times based in the Star Trek universe.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.480
All from the point of view of Q.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.880
Dad seemed to get that from every Cracker Barrel, we stopped at.

14:12.880 --> 14:15.760
Hey, you know, it's where, you know, we haven't listened to in a while.

14:15.760 --> 14:17.840
What's Q up to, I wonder?

14:17.840 --> 14:20.000
Let's check in with our old buddy Q.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.840
The best thing is you get it from one Cracker Barrel.

14:21.840 --> 14:25.200
You can turn it back in at a different Cracker Barrel that you'll stop at two hours later.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.880
Dad was, that was essentially a Q Continuum delivery man.

14:28.880 --> 14:32.960
He was a Q, he was a Q courier.

14:32.960 --> 14:36.880
There was one in Cincinnati, Ohio and they, the people working there were like, why the

14:36.880 --> 14:41.440
hell do we have 415 copies of the Q Continuum audiobook and no other Cracker Barrel in the

14:41.440 --> 14:42.320
country has any.

14:42.320 --> 14:43.520
Well, I'll tell you why.

14:43.520 --> 14:44.320
Mack McElroy.

14:44.320 --> 14:45.520
He had to catch them all.

14:45.520 --> 14:46.400
He caught them all.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.000
He caught every single one of them.

14:48.000 --> 14:54.320
You could, you could spend the entire trip writing an album of parody songs.

14:54.320 --> 14:59.200
Then really like get deep into them and spend so much time on them that you think that they're

14:59.200 --> 15:00.000
really good.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.160
And then when you get to Seattle, just play it for the first person you find and look,

15:04.160 --> 15:06.800
and look them dead in the eye and just say, is this anything?

15:08.640 --> 15:09.600
Is this something?

15:09.600 --> 15:11.840
I haven't, like, is this something?

15:11.840 --> 15:13.920
Are we, it's like, did we make anything?

15:13.920 --> 15:17.200
And maybe, maybe it won't work out this car trip and maybe it won't on the next car trip,

15:17.200 --> 15:19.360
but the third car trip, it'll definitely work out.

15:19.360 --> 15:20.640
That's how Weird Al Yankovic did it.

15:21.920 --> 15:26.160
That song, Biggest Ballets Wind in Minnesota, he wrote that on, on one of his trip, his

15:26.160 --> 15:26.640
third trip.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.320
He was like, wait a minute, I've got it.

15:28.320 --> 15:29.680
You really hone it down by the third trip.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.040
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

15:31.040 --> 15:32.080
And that would be great, Griffin.

15:32.080 --> 15:32.560
Thank you.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.240
This Yahoo was sent in by Colin Bailey.

15:34.240 --> 15:34.880
Thank you, Colin.

15:34.880 --> 15:37.920
It's by Yahoo Answers user Dorian G who asks.

15:37.920 --> 15:38.960
Now, Griffin, are you sure?

15:38.960 --> 15:43.040
Because Colin Bailey does not sound like any of the three people we normally get our Yahoos

15:43.040 --> 15:43.360
from.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.160
No, I know.

15:44.160 --> 15:44.880
I know.

15:44.880 --> 15:46.560
I'm very confused and I'm scared.

15:46.560 --> 15:47.120
This is proof.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.080
I read all the Yahoos.

15:49.440 --> 15:50.320
It's not laziness.

15:50.320 --> 15:51.520
I'm not neglecting everyone.

15:51.520 --> 15:52.720
It's just, they're that good.

15:52.720 --> 15:55.520
Colin Bailey, though, managed to worm his way in here.

15:55.520 --> 15:56.880
Congratulations, Colin.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.640
It's by Yahoo Answers user Dorian G.

15:58.640 --> 15:59.440
I already said that.

15:59.440 --> 16:00.080
A little drunk.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.080
Me too.

16:02.080 --> 16:02.560
Me too.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.360
I'm drinking an Austin Eastiders original.

16:05.360 --> 16:07.680
That's why we don't do evening.

16:07.680 --> 16:11.360
I'm drinking a giant Omagong Abbey Ale, 8.2%.

16:11.360 --> 16:13.920
It's the best they had at the Duane Reade.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.200
You guys are doing great.

16:15.200 --> 16:15.440
Yeah.

16:16.080 --> 16:18.960
I want whiskey, but I couldn't find a liquor store in New York.

16:18.960 --> 16:20.080
There aren't any.

16:20.080 --> 16:20.720
Yeah.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.080
Completely dry city.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.200
Clean living.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.240
Thanks, Bloomberg.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.720
Dorian G asks, handshakes.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.560
Should we just get rid of it?

16:32.320 --> 16:35.680
Maybe there is something to shaking hands when you have to make a deal.

16:35.680 --> 16:39.360
For me, at any rate, shaking hands with a stranger is just awkward.

16:39.360 --> 16:42.480
I especially hate the idea that you have to give an especially firm handshake.

16:42.480 --> 16:43.600
It can be painful.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.120
What's your view of handshakes?

16:45.120 --> 16:45.600
Update.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.160
Anyone else hate shaking hands with people?

16:48.160 --> 16:50.640
We've talked about handshaking like technique a lot.

16:51.280 --> 16:51.680
Yeah.

16:51.680 --> 16:55.200
So I don't want to get into like how to give a good handshake because I don't want to repeat.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.840
But handshakes, should we just get rid of it?

16:59.840 --> 17:00.080
No.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.280
And I'll tell you why, Griffin.

17:01.280 --> 17:04.080
If we're going to do a little point counterpoint here, I'll be pro handshake.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.160
When you meet a new person, right?

17:06.160 --> 17:08.000
You have a conversation with them.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.480
I'm the type of person, I always want to go in for the hug, right?

17:10.480 --> 17:13.440
But you never know how the other person is going to react to that.

17:13.440 --> 17:18.080
But if we abolish handshakes though, then you're seeing it wrong.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.000
Hugging is now the only option.

17:20.000 --> 17:20.640
No, Griffin.

17:20.640 --> 17:24.560
Because you throw that hand out there and then they go, uh, and hug you.

17:24.560 --> 17:25.920
Or they shake your hand.

17:25.920 --> 17:28.160
You've made some kind of physical contact.

17:28.160 --> 17:31.200
You've established like, I enjoy your presence too.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.360
And then the next time you see him, you hug.

17:33.360 --> 17:37.760
But the handshake is like a really great like, I like you before you say I love you.

17:37.760 --> 17:40.480
It's, it's an RSVP to a future hug.

17:40.480 --> 17:41.120
Exactly.

17:42.160 --> 17:42.400
I love this order.

17:42.400 --> 17:45.040
Without that, everybody's just hugging left and right.

17:45.040 --> 17:45.840
First time I met-

17:45.840 --> 17:46.720
Save the hug.

17:46.720 --> 17:49.280
First time I met my father-in-law, shook his hand, firm.

17:49.280 --> 17:51.280
Looked him right in the eye and I said, save the hug.

17:51.840 --> 17:56.560
Next time I flew in, saw me at the airport, dropped my bag, ran in, jumped into his arms,

17:56.560 --> 17:58.080
embraced him for two and a half minutes.

17:59.040 --> 18:03.360
And, and he, we, we left the embrace and he looked at me and he's like, I'm glad you prepared me.

18:03.360 --> 18:04.320
Glad you warned me about that.

18:04.320 --> 18:05.040
I was like, yeah, man.

18:05.840 --> 18:06.960
You got a few months to prepare.

18:06.960 --> 18:07.760
He's like, I needed them.

18:09.360 --> 18:10.480
I was really ready for it.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.640
I did some, I did some CrossFit to get ready for that hug.

18:12.640 --> 18:13.520
I was like, good.

18:13.520 --> 18:14.800
Yeah, I noticed the belts.

18:14.800 --> 18:15.280
For sure.

18:17.040 --> 18:17.280
Sure.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.440
Handshakes, handshakes, should we just get rid of it?

18:21.440 --> 18:22.080
I like that.

18:22.080 --> 18:26.400
You sell your drum set to somebody on Craigslist and it's like, well, bye.

18:27.920 --> 18:28.080
Right.

18:28.080 --> 18:29.760
There's nothing, there's nothing in between.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.040
The void will be filled.

18:31.920 --> 18:32.320
By what?

18:32.320 --> 18:37.520
If you abolish handshakes, it's going to become like you kick each other's feet, right?

18:37.520 --> 18:40.720
Or like you just rub your shoulder blades together.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.640
Something will establish like-

18:42.640 --> 18:45.680
You rub your big bald cone-shaped heads together.

18:45.680 --> 18:46.960
Only applicable to cone heads.

18:48.320 --> 18:50.160
Hashtag only applicable to cone heads.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.760
Hashtag cone heads only, please.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.480
Gotta get some new hashtags going.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.800
We gotta get that heat built back up.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.680
That cone head heat.

19:01.680 --> 19:03.600
I like the idea of doing foot stuff.

19:05.360 --> 19:06.880
That's a great quote.

19:06.880 --> 19:09.280
That's a wonderful pull quote for this episode.

19:09.280 --> 19:11.680
No, I like it because we don't, I don't have any kind of fetish,

19:11.680 --> 19:16.240
but I like the idea of, what's it called in Cat's Cradle?

19:16.880 --> 19:19.360
The Bokonons, they touch their feet together.

19:19.360 --> 19:20.640
Yeah, that's nice.

19:20.640 --> 19:22.080
That always seemed real nice to me.

19:23.040 --> 19:23.840
Yeah, for sure.

19:23.840 --> 19:26.800
We don't do enough, we don't do enough touching of each other's feet.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.640
I'm not saying I want to like kiss them or smell them

19:28.640 --> 19:30.720
or squeeze them together or something like that.

19:30.720 --> 19:33.600
I just touch my foot to your foot.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.120
You know what the nice thing is about that?

19:35.120 --> 19:37.600
When someone shakes your hand and they squeeze too hard,

19:37.600 --> 19:39.040
there's no visible evidence.

19:39.040 --> 19:41.600
There's no one watching going, hey, he squeezed too hard.

19:41.600 --> 19:45.040
But if you're swinging your foot, people can watch and go,

19:45.040 --> 19:46.480
oh, he was trying to dominate with that.

19:46.480 --> 19:47.760
Did you see how hard he swung his foot?

19:47.760 --> 19:49.680
And also, here's the situation.

19:49.680 --> 19:51.520
I come up to you, Travis, we've just met.

19:51.520 --> 19:56.080
I go in for the handshake, but you see my arm extend out just one degree too much

19:56.080 --> 19:58.000
and you think it's a hug and you go in for the hug.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.400
Oh shit, that's the worst moment of both of our lives.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.440
If I come at you foot extended, no confusion at all.

20:04.320 --> 20:05.120
No confusion at all.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.560
Well, but there's awkward hopping.

20:07.280 --> 20:08.160
Yeah, there's awkward hopping,

20:08.160 --> 20:15.600
but you're not going to confuse a Bokonon foot touch, a foot kiss, with a hug.

20:15.600 --> 20:16.640
It's just not going to happen.

20:17.200 --> 20:19.120
Where does this start?

20:19.840 --> 20:21.440
How do you light?

20:22.400 --> 20:25.360
How do you become the one small candle in the darkness

20:25.360 --> 20:29.760
that ignites the inferno of people touching their feet together?

20:29.760 --> 20:30.400
As far as I know-

20:30.400 --> 20:32.320
We're going to have to pay Viners.

20:32.320 --> 20:33.680
Yeah, I don't even think it's Viners.

20:33.680 --> 20:38.560
I think I write one guest post on BuzzFeed and then all of a sudden it's a thing.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.760
Did you know that people who write shit for BuzzFeed,

20:42.400 --> 20:43.520
it doesn't have to be real things.

20:43.520 --> 20:45.520
You can breathe things into existence.

20:45.520 --> 20:52.880
It is a fusion device that you can just think into and things manifest.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.080
It's a will engine.

20:54.080 --> 20:56.000
It's a fucking matter compiler.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.400
You just think into it and it manifests in real life.

20:58.400 --> 21:01.680
I get a job at BuzzFeed tomorrow, I write a post,

21:01.680 --> 21:04.720
things you'll never believe, kiss your feet to other people's feet.

21:04.720 --> 21:05.520
Make your feet kiss.

21:06.080 --> 21:08.320
And then it's the whole craze.

21:08.320 --> 21:10.080
Especially when Justin Wong's doing it.

21:10.080 --> 21:12.160
Give a celebrity endorsement.

21:12.160 --> 21:16.240
You'll never believe how good Kim K and Beyonce touched feet

21:16.240 --> 21:18.640
at the premiere of Paul Blart 3.

21:18.640 --> 21:21.040
Even Steve Buscemi's touching feet.

21:21.040 --> 21:23.360
Yeah, even old Buscemi.

21:23.360 --> 21:25.840
He said he would never touch feet with another foot.

21:25.840 --> 21:26.560
But look at him now.

21:26.560 --> 21:28.640
Yeah, I just, I like it.

21:28.640 --> 21:32.400
And then you got that Buscemi bump.

21:32.400 --> 21:32.880
Feels good.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.720
I'm a guy that a lot of people try to hug.

21:34.720 --> 21:36.160
And then there's no confusion now.

21:36.160 --> 21:37.200
Come here, give me a foot kiss.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.000
You think foot kiss?

21:40.000 --> 21:41.280
That's better than touching feet.

21:41.280 --> 21:42.560
Because if you say in a headline,

21:42.560 --> 21:44.160
Steve Buscemi loves to touch feet,

21:44.160 --> 21:45.520
that guy doesn't need that press.

21:45.520 --> 21:46.640
He's a hero.

21:46.640 --> 21:47.680
He's a good, good actor.

21:48.240 --> 21:51.120
He's a good actor that was also,

21:52.080 --> 21:54.160
when he heard that 9-11 happened,

21:54.160 --> 21:55.760
he didn't rush away from the disaster.

21:55.760 --> 21:59.360
He got his gear and went down to the site and got busy.

21:59.360 --> 22:00.720
Got really heavy all of a sudden.

22:00.720 --> 22:03.440
That sounds like a joke, I'm saying.

22:03.440 --> 22:06.160
Yeah, especially my appreciation level

22:06.160 --> 22:10.960
for fucking national hero, hero actor, Steve Buscemi.

22:10.960 --> 22:12.960
And he did not want any press about it.

22:12.960 --> 22:14.480
He didn't make a big deal about it.

22:14.480 --> 22:16.400
He just did because it was his duty.

22:16.400 --> 22:16.640
Yeah.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.320
A lot of people don't know this.

22:18.320 --> 22:20.240
You've been pronouncing his name wrong your whole life.

22:20.240 --> 22:21.280
It's actually Buccemi.

22:21.280 --> 22:25.760
A lot of people don't miss some things about Steve Buscemi.

22:25.760 --> 22:29.440
Welcome to Buscemi, bros.

22:29.440 --> 22:30.640
No, Buccemi.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.480
Buccemi, bros.

22:32.480 --> 22:33.440
Nope, you're still doing it wrong.

22:33.440 --> 22:33.840
I'm sorry, one more time.

22:33.840 --> 22:37.280
There's a brief, there's a coda in there, a TSL coda.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.240
Buccemi.

22:38.240 --> 22:38.960
You gotta really-

22:38.960 --> 22:39.440
Buccemi.

22:39.440 --> 22:40.160
Yeah, there you go.

22:40.880 --> 22:42.320
Oh, like I started to say a word

22:42.320 --> 22:44.560
and then halfway through changed it to a different word.

22:44.560 --> 22:45.920
Yeah, Buccemi.

22:45.920 --> 22:48.960
And if you gotta swallow the U, Buccemi.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.760
B- I did it too hard.

22:51.760 --> 22:53.200
Sorry, I did it too hard.

22:53.200 --> 22:56.640
By the way, Steve, anytime you wanna come on the podcast,

22:56.640 --> 22:58.000
have your people talk to our people.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.880
We don't have to talk about your heroic work.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.160
We can talk about Tree's Lounge.

23:02.160 --> 23:02.720
I don't care.

23:03.520 --> 23:04.640
We're here, Steve.

23:04.640 --> 23:05.040
We're here.

23:05.680 --> 23:06.800
We've always been here.

23:06.800 --> 23:07.920
I would say hit us up on Twitter,

23:07.920 --> 23:10.080
but there's no way you fucking use Twitter.

23:10.080 --> 23:11.360
You're the coolest dude ever.

23:11.360 --> 23:12.240
Read this next question.

23:13.760 --> 23:16.720
How do I get my friends to play Dungeons and Dragons with me?

23:16.720 --> 23:18.880
I've asked them if they wanted to play D&D before.

23:18.880 --> 23:20.320
I bought the handbook and dice.

23:20.320 --> 23:21.280
They all said yes.

23:21.280 --> 23:22.160
I bought the stuff.

23:22.720 --> 23:25.280
When I tried to arrange a session,

23:25.280 --> 23:27.440
they keep coming up with excuses.

23:27.440 --> 23:28.320
That's from Kieran.

23:28.320 --> 23:29.200
I think it's obvious.

23:30.080 --> 23:31.760
You start a D&D podcast with them?

23:32.320 --> 23:33.920
No, you need to spring it on them.

23:34.800 --> 23:37.120
You don't need to ambush them with good times.

23:37.120 --> 23:40.640
You're saying a full-blown to catch a Dungeon Master?

23:40.640 --> 23:42.160
I'm saying that if you sit there and go,

23:42.160 --> 23:43.440
let's play some D&D and they're like,

23:43.440 --> 23:44.720
oh, well, I can't.

23:44.720 --> 23:49.280
But if you're like, I'm going to throw a five-person party rager at my house.

23:49.280 --> 23:52.240
But if they walk in their house with a bottle of Arbor Mist

23:52.240 --> 23:53.360
and you say, why don't you have a seat?

23:53.920 --> 23:55.280
I want to talk to you about some stuff.

23:56.080 --> 23:58.880
Have you thought about a name for your halfling cleric?

23:58.880 --> 24:01.120
And they're like, I don't know what you're talking about.

24:01.120 --> 24:02.080
I'm just here to party.

24:02.960 --> 24:04.560
You know, a lot of people don't know this,

24:04.560 --> 24:07.920
but the movie The Game is actually about Sean Penn

24:08.800 --> 24:12.080
trying like an elaborate plan to get his brother Michael Douglas

24:12.080 --> 24:13.760
to play D&D with him.

24:13.760 --> 24:15.920
At the end of the movie, there's a deleted scene

24:15.920 --> 24:17.360
where he whispers in his ear like,

24:17.360 --> 24:18.240
you just LARPed.

24:18.800 --> 24:20.080
I just made you LARP.

24:20.080 --> 24:21.120
This whole thing's been LARPing.

24:21.120 --> 24:22.000
And Michael Douglas is like,

24:22.000 --> 24:24.560
oh, shit, if I LARPed, I can definitely play D&D.

24:24.560 --> 24:28.320
If I've crossed that threshold, roll me up a sheet, bruh.

24:29.440 --> 24:31.120
So I had a lot of friends in Cincinnati

24:31.120 --> 24:35.680
who were not necessarily like into the idea at first,

24:35.680 --> 24:39.040
but then when like I got them into character creation,

24:39.040 --> 24:42.320
which is for me the most fun part of D&D,

24:42.320 --> 24:44.880
like then all they wanted to do was play.

24:44.880 --> 24:45.200
You know what I mean?

24:45.200 --> 24:46.080
It's harder now though,

24:46.080 --> 24:47.520
because they don't have that awesome app

24:47.520 --> 24:49.280
that just like makes the shit for you.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.320
Yeah, I do miss that.

24:50.320 --> 24:51.200
I miss that shit.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.200
Like joking aside, like that's how you do it.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.880
That's how we got going.

24:54.880 --> 24:56.080
That's how we got people going.

24:56.080 --> 24:59.600
Like it's, that's the hook for D&D.

24:59.600 --> 25:01.200
As soon as you get somebody to make a character,

25:01.200 --> 25:02.480
that's it, they'll want to play it.

25:02.480 --> 25:04.640
Because they really get invested in that character.

25:04.640 --> 25:05.120
Right.

25:05.120 --> 25:06.800
Oh, I put a lot of thought and time

25:06.800 --> 25:09.040
into like their name and background and shit.

25:09.040 --> 25:11.600
Like I guess maybe you could like make it for them a little bit,

25:11.600 --> 25:13.200
but leave it open for them to change it.

25:13.200 --> 25:14.960
Just be like, hey, I made this thing

25:14.960 --> 25:17.040
because I think it'd be like what you would want to do.

25:18.160 --> 25:19.120
Do you like this?

25:19.120 --> 25:20.960
I drew you a guy.

25:20.960 --> 25:21.680
You could be that guy.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.280
If you wanted to be that guy, you could be anything.

25:23.840 --> 25:26.080
The problem is it can be really intimidating

25:26.080 --> 25:26.960
for first time people

25:26.960 --> 25:29.200
because it seems like there's so much shit to learn.

25:29.760 --> 25:31.120
But really like you say,

25:31.120 --> 25:33.280
I want to do blank and roll a dice.

25:33.280 --> 25:36.080
But like until you actually get them to sit down and do that,

25:36.080 --> 25:38.800
it seems like really intimidating

25:38.800 --> 25:40.960
because of all the chick tracks that tell them

25:40.960 --> 25:41.760
it's of the devil.

25:42.320 --> 25:43.920
I don't think that's what's scaring people off.

25:43.920 --> 25:45.440
That's what's scaring people off.

25:45.440 --> 25:46.880
I think it's that Tom Hanks movie.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.240
It's probably that Tom Hanks movie.

25:48.240 --> 25:49.280
That shit's fucked up.

25:50.240 --> 25:51.760
I'm talking about Captain Phillips.

25:54.640 --> 25:57.120
This is the best way to describe D&D to people.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.360
You remember pretending as a child?

25:59.360 --> 26:02.080
Well, imagine one guy there had the ability to say,

26:02.080 --> 26:02.960
oh, no, you don't.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.120
Hey, you can't pretend that.

26:07.120 --> 26:07.920
Don't pretend that.

26:07.920 --> 26:08.400
How dare you?

26:08.400 --> 26:10.000
Let me check my pretend book.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.880
Oh, sorry, you have to roll a 10 pretend or better.

26:12.880 --> 26:14.640
Can you pretend different?

26:15.280 --> 26:17.040
Can you pretend a different thing?

26:17.040 --> 26:19.040
Can you imagine better?

26:19.040 --> 26:21.280
There's nothing else to pretend in this room.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.640
It's time to move on.

26:22.640 --> 26:23.520
Oh, no, you don't.

26:24.960 --> 26:26.000
Not so fast.

26:26.000 --> 26:26.960
How could you swim that?

26:26.960 --> 26:28.080
You couldn't do that.

26:28.080 --> 26:31.200
I'm going to train Charlie when she's pretending with her friends.

26:31.200 --> 26:33.600
Like if one of them like swings her foam sword and is like,

26:33.600 --> 26:36.320
I blasted you with my laser, my lightsaber.

26:36.320 --> 26:39.360
I don't want to train her and just be like, no, you didn't.

26:39.360 --> 26:40.160
Let me check the book.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.400
Let me check the book real quick.

26:42.400 --> 26:43.040
No, you didn't.

26:43.040 --> 26:43.360
I just checked.

26:43.360 --> 26:45.120
Oh, you're negative one in charisma.

26:45.120 --> 26:46.560
You didn't do shit, Steve.

26:46.560 --> 26:47.600
You didn't convince me anything.

26:48.880 --> 26:49.760
That's not lava.

26:50.640 --> 26:51.520
Look at it.

26:51.520 --> 26:52.800
It's absolutely not lava.

26:52.800 --> 26:53.840
That is definitely carpet.

26:54.400 --> 26:57.120
Listen, if it was lava, yeah, I would be right there with you.

26:57.120 --> 26:57.760
Yeah, absolutely.

26:57.760 --> 26:58.640
It's not lava, though.

26:58.640 --> 26:59.760
Pretend something else, please.

27:00.400 --> 27:01.600
We can pretend it's hardwood.

27:01.600 --> 27:02.240
It's carpet.

27:02.240 --> 27:03.120
Like I could stretch.

27:04.480 --> 27:05.360
I can meet you halfway.

27:05.360 --> 27:16.160
Let's go to Mike's book.

27:16.160 --> 27:18.720
Let's talk about the internet and websites.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.720
I hate it and I wish it never existed.

27:20.720 --> 27:22.720
What if it was easier and better and you liked it?

27:23.680 --> 27:27.520
Like if all the people on it, if I could control and choose each individual person,

27:27.520 --> 27:29.840
I could be like, Mark, yeah, you can be on the internet.

27:29.840 --> 27:33.360
What if you could control like one itty bitty tiny corner of it?

27:33.360 --> 27:35.600
That was all yours that only Griffin could live in.

27:36.720 --> 27:38.160
That just sounds like a book.

27:38.960 --> 27:42.640
But it's a book that other people can look at from all across the world.

27:42.640 --> 27:43.200
AOL.

27:43.920 --> 27:45.760
Okay, what have we done?

27:46.480 --> 27:48.240
Harness the power of keywords.

27:48.240 --> 27:50.400
I was trying to get to Squarespace.

27:50.400 --> 27:51.520
Okay, get there better.

27:51.520 --> 27:53.440
Why do I have to be the guy who says the thing?

27:53.440 --> 27:54.560
You guys say it.

27:54.560 --> 27:55.520
Imagine better.

27:55.520 --> 28:02.720
Imagine if you could make a page, but not just any page, a web page that people can see and click on.

28:02.720 --> 28:07.920
Do you have a mouse you're trying to break in?

28:07.920 --> 28:11.520
Well, if we got something to click on for you, it's called Squarespace.

28:11.520 --> 28:15.920
It's an all-in-one clicking hub where people can click anywhere on it and it takes them to goods

28:15.920 --> 28:18.160
and services and perhaps some entertainment.

28:18.160 --> 28:19.760
This page has everything.

28:19.760 --> 28:20.720
Click anywhere you want.

28:20.720 --> 28:21.600

28:27.200 --> 28:30.720
Click it until you've destroyed your mouse with your clicking.

28:30.720 --> 28:34.080
Click the clicking right out of your mouse, clicker.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.840
Noise making device.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.120
Hey, Mother Clicker.

28:37.120 --> 28:38.480

And it is beautiful.

29:02.800 --> 29:05.760
Some beautiful sites I've seen from the Squarespace engine.

29:05.760 --> 29:06.640
Highly clickable.

29:06.640 --> 29:07.680
Highly clickable.

29:07.680 --> 29:08.720
Highly clickable.

29:08.720 --> 29:09.520
All the clicks.

29:10.480 --> 29:13.680
Now what if you're trying to get a bunch of people to click all at the same time?

29:14.240 --> 29:15.920
Three, two, nope.

29:15.920 --> 29:16.160
Mark.

29:16.160 --> 29:21.520
This episode I feel like has been half me yelling at imaginary people.

29:22.080 --> 29:23.760
Those are my favorite episodes.

29:23.760 --> 29:24.080
Okay.

29:25.760 --> 29:28.400
What if I did want to get a bunch of clicks going at the same time, Travis?

29:28.400 --> 29:31.520
Well, if you want to get a bunch of clicks, let me recommend Basecamp.

29:31.520 --> 29:34.480
A lot of times I feel like clicking something and I don't know where to click.

29:34.480 --> 29:35.840
I don't know what to click.

29:35.840 --> 29:38.960
I just go to Yahoo and just start clicking anything that will have me.

29:38.960 --> 29:40.800
But that's a mistake, Justin.

29:40.800 --> 29:41.760
Any port in a store.

29:41.760 --> 29:42.320
That's me.

29:42.320 --> 29:46.320
You click on Grey's Anatomy Recap and it's like, no, I'm busy.

29:47.760 --> 29:49.600
Don't click me right now, Justin.

29:49.600 --> 29:50.560
I'm busy.

29:50.560 --> 29:54.160
I'll tell you what, Meredith and company are up to in a bit, but I'm busy right now.

29:54.720 --> 29:56.240
I have to check my webmail.

29:57.840 --> 30:03.200
Well, Basecamp is a service that allows you to coordinate with people wherever they are.

30:03.200 --> 30:07.280
That way you can all work towards a common objective, common goal.

30:07.280 --> 30:10.400
No matter what your role is, no matter what your responsibilities are,

30:10.400 --> 30:12.800
it lets you finish the project together easier.

30:12.800 --> 30:15.600
Too often in this world you're working with people that are spread out,

30:15.600 --> 30:18.000
not only throughout the country, but even throughout the world.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.440
But Basecamp runs on the cloud and has secure servers,

30:21.440 --> 30:24.480
and you don't have to mess around with anything that's too confusing.

30:24.480 --> 30:26.960
Because let's face it, I don't know how the cloud works,

30:26.960 --> 30:29.760
but Basecamp makes it easy so you don't have to worry about it.

30:29.760 --> 30:31.840
And because you're a listener of My Brother and My Brother and Me,

30:31.840 --> 30:35.120
you can try Basecamp absolutely free for two months.

30:35.120 --> 30:40.240
And that's plenty of time to get all of your clicks out before you head off to college.

30:40.240 --> 30:42.800
So go to basecamp.com slash my brother.

30:43.840 --> 30:48.960
Also, if you go to that web address, you'll find some custom art

30:49.520 --> 30:53.760
featuring a beloved My Brother and My Brother and Me character

30:53.760 --> 30:56.000
and the little guy from Basecamp.

30:56.000 --> 30:56.720
It's very cute.

30:56.720 --> 30:59.440
It's really, really beautiful and also haunting.

31:00.720 --> 31:07.520
I got a message here for Morgan Harpster, and it's from Chicago, the city that never sins.

31:07.520 --> 31:08.400
For Gibbs.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.040
Oh, I like yours better.

31:12.160 --> 31:14.160
Chicago says to Morgan Harpster,

31:14.880 --> 31:18.400
I know that this year has been crazy and not always in a good way,

31:18.400 --> 31:20.320
but not only is the weather getting nicer,

31:20.320 --> 31:23.520
but you have that great new milk addiction to spend your time on.

31:23.520 --> 31:26.160
You're a great friend and a Better My Bim Bam fan,

31:26.160 --> 31:28.880
and I'm sure hearing the brothers talk about you will make your day.

31:29.840 --> 31:31.680
Boy, that'd be a sad state of affairs, huh?

31:31.680 --> 31:33.440
Hearing us three chumps.

31:33.440 --> 31:35.440
As you sip on room temperature milk.

31:35.440 --> 31:40.080
Just sip on room temperature milk and you hear three chumps just whisper your name into the darkness.

31:40.080 --> 31:42.720
And you feel a shiver of joy for the first time in months.

31:43.280 --> 31:44.160
Do you guys-

31:44.160 --> 31:45.520
Get a hot rod.

31:46.640 --> 31:50.560
Do you guys ever get deep into milk?

31:50.560 --> 31:53.920
You ever go for a glass of milk, maybe you don't have anything else in the fridge,

31:53.920 --> 31:57.360
you have a glass of milk and you remember like, wow, this is good.

31:58.400 --> 32:02.880
No, for me, I get a tall glass of that sweet cow juice

32:02.880 --> 32:05.920
and I sip it down, cool, and then I say, what am I doing?

32:05.920 --> 32:08.160
This is gonna make me shit my brains out later.

32:11.840 --> 32:14.000
I open the fridge and look at the milk and think,

32:14.000 --> 32:17.440
well, surely I didn't buy that in a reasonable amount of time from now.

32:17.440 --> 32:18.960
And I always assume milk is bad.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
God, you think, damn, you should pass Travis.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.240
Why couldn't you have enjoyed this sweet milk?

32:24.240 --> 32:26.880
Yes, why did you forget about milk until this moment?

32:26.880 --> 32:28.160
Got a message here from Matt.

32:28.160 --> 32:30.560
You know what my favorite thing about milk is?

32:30.560 --> 32:34.560
When people call it moo juice and they're trying to be cool.

32:34.560 --> 32:36.720
Like, you're already talking about milk.

32:36.720 --> 32:37.920
You can't be cool.

32:37.920 --> 32:39.760
There's nothing cool to say about milk.

32:39.760 --> 32:41.120
Well, round robin it.

32:41.120 --> 32:42.880
Round robin it, we can find it.

32:42.880 --> 32:45.440
Start with whoever just feels the spirit move them

32:45.440 --> 32:48.080
and we each get one, another name for milk.

32:48.080 --> 32:49.440
Uh, tit liquid.

32:50.320 --> 32:51.120
Okay.

32:51.120 --> 32:53.520
Wait, can I change it to tit squeezens?

32:53.520 --> 32:58.000
No, sorry, that is better, but I'm afraid that you submitted tit liquid.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.320
Hi everybody.

33:00.320 --> 33:04.880
I'm tit liquid running for Republican primary.

33:05.760 --> 33:07.120
My name is tit liquid.

33:07.120 --> 33:10.160
Listen, friends, I've had a lot of great hits over the years.

33:10.160 --> 33:13.920
You remember of you probably singing to your baby at night as they go off to sleep.

33:15.920 --> 33:16.880
I'm tit liquid.

33:16.880 --> 33:18.480
Do you like clicking on things?

33:18.480 --> 33:19.360
Sure, we all do.

33:20.800 --> 33:22.800
Hey, I'm tit liquid.

33:22.800 --> 33:25.840
You know, that RV of yours is looking pretty broken down.

33:25.840 --> 33:29.120
Why don't you bring it on in to tit liquid's RV repair.

33:29.120 --> 33:32.640
Hey baby, I'll tell you what, tit liquid will just sing right in the tailpipe.

33:32.640 --> 33:33.680
That thing be good as new.

33:35.760 --> 33:38.880
When you want molasses based candies, where do you turn to?

33:38.880 --> 33:40.960
Well, you go to your friend tit liquid.

33:40.960 --> 33:45.360
Tit liquid has the best of molasses and sassafras and whorehound based candies

33:45.360 --> 33:46.720
of this side of the Mississippi.

33:46.720 --> 33:47.360
Come on down.

33:47.920 --> 33:48.960
Sorry about everything.

33:48.960 --> 33:57.920
When you need an assassin to take out a loved one, you need absolute confidentiality.

33:57.920 --> 33:58.800
Who do you turn to?

33:58.800 --> 34:00.320
Well, there's one name in the phone book.

34:00.320 --> 34:03.360
If you look under professional assassins, that one name's tit liquid.

34:03.360 --> 34:07.600
Y'all know me by my sinister calling card, which is I put a little piece of whorehound

34:07.600 --> 34:10.720
candy over each of their eyeballs so they can have something to suck on

34:10.720 --> 34:12.080
while they cross the river sticks.

34:12.080 --> 34:13.120
It's me tit liquid.

34:13.120 --> 34:14.000
I'll kill your wife.

34:14.560 --> 34:18.320
Please remember that if you do ask me tit liquid to kill your wife

34:18.320 --> 34:21.840
and you change your mind, I am unstoppable and unreachable.

34:21.840 --> 34:26.800
I am the Japanese bullet trains of assassins.

34:26.800 --> 34:29.760
There is no impediment that you can put in front of me that will keep me

34:29.760 --> 34:30.800
from my dark goals.

34:31.360 --> 34:32.240
I'm tit liquid.

34:33.040 --> 34:34.080
I'm tit liquid.

34:34.080 --> 34:35.120
I'll do it for free.

34:35.120 --> 34:35.520
Come on.

34:36.240 --> 34:38.240
I just need to quiet the darkness within.

34:39.520 --> 34:43.280
Anything to feel at one emotion, no matter how fleeting.

34:44.080 --> 34:44.640
Tit liquid.

34:44.640 --> 34:45.280
This world is beating me down.

34:45.280 --> 34:49.200
The eternal life that tit liquid has suffered is too much for me to bear

34:49.200 --> 34:50.800
without the joy of killing.

34:50.800 --> 34:54.160
I just need stigma to get me through this eternal bleak existence.

34:54.160 --> 34:59.280
As the world's only living vampire, I tit liquid crave death

35:01.040 --> 35:05.680
that I can only visit in all others and I cannot experience the sweet release

35:05.680 --> 35:07.040
of that myself.

35:07.040 --> 35:12.080
So if you want a vampire to kill your wife or maybe just sexually tempt her

35:12.080 --> 35:14.640
in a way that she's become accustomed to from hit series,

35:14.640 --> 35:18.400
such as True Blood and Forever Night, then tit liquid is your man.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.000
Just be careful though.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.520
Down on I-95.

35:21.520 --> 35:22.720
Come on down on I-95.

35:22.720 --> 35:27.120
Only problem is when I turn into a mist or fog or any kind of spectral form.

35:27.120 --> 35:30.800
Well, I'll be damned if I don't drop all my whore around candy right there

35:30.800 --> 35:31.280
on the floor.

35:31.280 --> 35:32.160
Passes right through.

35:34.960 --> 35:37.840
I'm tit liquid and I approve this message.

35:39.200 --> 35:39.760
Got a message.

35:39.760 --> 35:41.120
One more message for Matt.

35:42.000 --> 35:42.320
Yeah.

35:42.320 --> 35:46.080
From Cody and Lee and they say, so I bet you thought you weren't getting

35:46.080 --> 35:46.560
anything.

35:46.560 --> 35:48.880
We weren't going to give you anything for your birthday.

35:48.880 --> 35:49.520
Surprise.

35:50.320 --> 35:54.320
We spent 100 George Washingtons to get these chuckle heads to tell the

35:54.320 --> 35:57.360
literally billions of people listening how awesome you are.

35:57.360 --> 36:01.600
Thanks for introducing us to NBNBAM on that Rushmore trip and enjoy listening

36:01.600 --> 36:02.800
to Justin pronounce.

36:02.800 --> 36:04.080
Oh, I'm going to let Justin do it.

36:07.680 --> 36:08.720
Copacastance.

36:08.720 --> 36:09.200
Nope.

36:09.200 --> 36:09.920
One more time.

36:09.920 --> 36:12.720
Copacastance.

36:13.760 --> 36:14.400
Okay.

36:14.400 --> 36:16.240
Do you mean capacitance?

36:16.240 --> 36:17.200
Copacastance.

36:19.120 --> 36:20.560
Are you still doing your tit liquid?

36:20.560 --> 36:21.200
Okay.

36:21.200 --> 36:22.240
My name is Tit Liquid.

36:22.240 --> 36:26.480
If you and your wife have mastered the art of tango and other forbidden

36:26.480 --> 36:28.560
dances, why not turn to Copacastance?

36:29.120 --> 36:32.480
It's the latest craze from the Middle East and it is just burning up the

36:32.480 --> 36:34.000
dance floors here in Alpaca.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.520
Have you guys tried hummus?

36:35.520 --> 36:37.200
Hi, it's me, Tit Liquid.

36:37.200 --> 36:40.880
The finest purveyor of hummus this side of the Mississippi.

36:40.880 --> 36:43.840
It's just some sort of crazy kind of bean gravy.

36:45.600 --> 36:48.880
As your tzatziki sauce losses its zeek, as your

36:50.400 --> 36:54.400
tandoori tit liquid purveyor of fine exotic sauces.

36:55.040 --> 36:59.360
I can't make tits nor ass of this weird exotic goo, but I'll be damned if I

36:59.360 --> 37:02.000
don't like eating it on my food.

37:02.000 --> 37:07.760
Sometimes when I'm in my weaker moments, I'll dip a hot dog bun right in

37:07.760 --> 37:09.840
there and just eat it clean off.

37:09.840 --> 37:10.720
I don't care.

37:10.720 --> 37:11.360
Tit Liquid.

37:14.640 --> 37:16.560
Can we stop the episode now?

37:18.480 --> 37:21.200
Can this be a 40-minute installment?

37:21.760 --> 37:22.960
About Tit Liquid?

37:24.640 --> 37:26.400
Are your kids having problems with math?

37:26.400 --> 37:26.640
Hi.

37:26.640 --> 37:33.520
I got a 700 on my SATs just in the math section.

37:33.520 --> 37:36.400
Do it okay on the English too, but that's not what this commercial is about.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.520
Hey, it's me, Tit Liquid.

37:43.520 --> 37:45.600
Are you still afraid of dogs?

37:48.560 --> 37:49.680
You see what I can do about that?

37:49.680 --> 37:51.280
I got two real crazy ones here.

37:51.920 --> 37:52.960
Hey, it's Tit Liquid.

37:52.960 --> 37:53.920
I talked to Deborah.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.040
She forgave you.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.720
So we're all cool here.

37:57.280 --> 38:00.080
You guys don't have to be awkward around each other anymore.

38:00.080 --> 38:01.280
Thanks so much.

38:01.280 --> 38:02.080
Try the hummus.

38:03.520 --> 38:07.920
Are you in need of professional looking headshots for your toddler performer

38:07.920 --> 38:10.000
to make her make it on the Great White Way?

38:10.000 --> 38:11.200
Well, turn to Tit Liquid.

38:11.200 --> 38:17.200
I'm the world's leading purveyor of children photography, specifically for performers

38:17.200 --> 38:18.960
trying to make it on the Great White Way.

38:18.960 --> 38:20.240
You want the next Matilda?

38:20.240 --> 38:21.040
You turn to Tit.

38:21.040 --> 38:24.480
I'm also an amateur ghost hunter.

38:25.360 --> 38:28.320
I will do it for free to maintain my amateur status.

38:28.320 --> 38:30.080
I'll tell you what's a bummer, guys.

38:31.040 --> 38:34.160
The name of this episode is obviously going to be Tit Liquid.

38:34.160 --> 38:36.640
And people are going to see that and go, I think I'm going to skip this one.

38:39.280 --> 38:40.800
They're not going to know what we've done.

38:41.360 --> 38:43.840
This beloved, beloved character.

38:43.840 --> 38:44.080
Right.

38:44.080 --> 38:45.360
And then we're going to have Tit Liquid shirts.

38:45.360 --> 38:47.120
Universal spokesman, Tit Liquid.

38:47.120 --> 38:48.640
We're going to have Tit Liquid shirts out there.

38:48.640 --> 38:50.560
And people are going to be like, I don't remember that.

38:50.560 --> 38:53.040
God, I should probably just stop listening to that show.

38:53.040 --> 38:54.800
We got to title it, like, Tit Liquid.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.320
No, but really, listen to this one.

38:57.280 --> 38:58.320
This is an OK one.

38:59.280 --> 39:00.000
This is Biz.

39:00.000 --> 39:00.880
And I'm Teresa.

39:00.880 --> 39:05.280
And we host a show called One Bad Mother, a comedy podcast about parenting.

39:05.280 --> 39:07.280
Not a parenting podcast.

39:07.280 --> 39:08.160
Guess what?

39:08.160 --> 39:09.760
We both just had babies.

39:10.320 --> 39:10.720
Again.

39:12.000 --> 39:17.520
Check out the show enjoyed by breeders and ballers alike on iTunes or maximumfun.org.

39:18.160 --> 39:19.600
Do you guys want a yahoo?

39:19.600 --> 39:21.120
Of course.

39:21.120 --> 39:25.200
This yahoo was sent in by gamerecognizedgame, Rachel Sperling.

39:25.200 --> 39:25.920
Thank you, Rachel.

39:25.920 --> 39:30.720
It's by Nicolina, who asks, how to forget a major spoiler?

39:32.640 --> 39:37.200
I just waited five years of my life just to know who A is.

39:37.760 --> 39:40.400
But no, I had to learn it from Facebook.

39:40.400 --> 39:42.720
And just now I saw a spoiler of Prison Break.

39:43.280 --> 39:44.960
And I'm just at season two.

39:44.960 --> 39:46.320
A major spoiler.

39:46.880 --> 39:48.480
I need to forget it.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.800
I am going crazy.

39:52.080 --> 39:52.560
Clearly.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.800
That is, of course, referencing Pretty Little Liars.

39:57.360 --> 40:02.080
And I only know that because I also got that shit spoiler for me on Facebook, which I appreciate.

40:02.080 --> 40:03.680
I'm never going to watch Pretty Little Liars.

40:03.680 --> 40:08.480
But it's nice to possess information in case there's like a pub quiz or something.

40:08.480 --> 40:09.520
Pretty Little Pub Quiz.

40:10.080 --> 40:14.960
Now, the one thing you have to know about Pretty Little Liars is that there were some

40:14.960 --> 40:21.040
spoilers circulating, but they ended up being fake.

40:21.040 --> 40:21.920
They were BS.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.920
Like, they were like half true.

40:23.920 --> 40:24.960
I know, I know.

40:27.200 --> 40:28.240
So it was kind of a hoax.

40:28.800 --> 40:33.680
So you can keep telling yourself that and see if you're right.

40:33.680 --> 40:38.880
Obviously, Eternal Sunshine and the Spotless Mind, that was a sci-fi movie.

40:38.880 --> 40:39.920
A sci-fi thriller.

40:40.640 --> 40:42.800
I thought it was more of a romantic comedy myself.

40:42.800 --> 40:44.720
Well, how can you forget?

40:44.720 --> 40:49.520
If you see, you're flipping through Facebook and you see Pretty Little Liars, the A has

40:49.520 --> 40:52.000
been crag this whole time.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.040
Ah, no.

40:53.040 --> 40:56.880
If you just look at like eight other things really quickly, will it push it out of your

40:56.880 --> 40:57.120
short term?

40:57.120 --> 40:57.840
This is what I'm saying.

40:57.840 --> 40:58.880
You can't remove it.

40:58.880 --> 41:01.120
So what you have to do is dilute it.

41:01.120 --> 41:07.440
You need to just begin consuming information at a voracious, unsustainable rate.

41:07.440 --> 41:08.000
Yeah.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.880
Pretty Little Liars centric information?

41:10.880 --> 41:12.640
No, no, you got to get away from that.

41:12.640 --> 41:13.200
Get away from it.

41:13.200 --> 41:14.400
I'm saying as far away from that.

41:14.400 --> 41:18.000
Like go pick up a Big John's bathroom reader and just start slamming it.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Just start cramming it like you're-

41:20.000 --> 41:23.840
Almost to a point where like you're not even like taking it in consciously anymore.

41:23.840 --> 41:28.160
Like you've got a test on Big John's bathroom reader in a half hour and you got to cram

41:28.160 --> 41:28.960
it right now.

41:29.760 --> 41:34.080
So that later when someone's like, who is A in Pretty Little Liars?

41:34.080 --> 41:38.960
And you're just like, Abraham Lincoln had 11 toes and you can't even remember because

41:38.960 --> 41:40.560
you have so much static going on.

41:41.840 --> 41:43.360
He did have 11 toes, by the way.

41:43.360 --> 41:44.560
That's why he was so honest.

41:44.560 --> 41:44.960
Is that-

41:45.520 --> 41:47.520
Well, those two don't seem related.

41:48.160 --> 41:50.560
And I know this is one of those things that you're lying about.

41:50.560 --> 41:52.080
But are you lying about this?

41:52.080 --> 41:52.880
No, I'm not.

41:52.880 --> 41:53.440
Are you sure?

41:54.320 --> 41:56.400
I am definitely lying about this.

41:56.400 --> 41:57.520
You are the worst.

41:58.480 --> 41:59.520
You really have me going.

42:00.880 --> 42:02.240
How to forget a major sp-

42:02.240 --> 42:03.760
Like I've heard some-

42:03.760 --> 42:06.960
We've all heard some stuff and it's a bummer for me now.

42:06.960 --> 42:11.360
We're watching Old Seasons Survivor and I feel like I know all the winners.

42:11.360 --> 42:12.560
And I don't even know how.

42:12.560 --> 42:14.640
It's just I think I got it through osmosis.

42:15.280 --> 42:15.600
Yeah.

42:16.160 --> 42:17.040
There's a lot of that.

42:17.040 --> 42:21.360
I call it cultural osmosis because there's lots of movies that I've never seen before.

42:21.360 --> 42:24.240
But I know exactly what happens in that movie.

42:24.960 --> 42:25.600
You know what I mean?

42:25.600 --> 42:31.120
Like I only recently watched Terminator 1 for the first time like two months ago.

42:31.120 --> 42:34.960
But I knew everything that happened in that movie because it's been referenced in everything

42:34.960 --> 42:36.400
and talked about on everything.

42:36.400 --> 42:36.640
I-

42:38.800 --> 42:39.360
What's the-

42:39.360 --> 42:40.640
What's the statute of limit?

42:40.640 --> 42:43.680
Not to turn the question on its ear, but what's the statute of limitations?

42:43.680 --> 42:47.120
Like can I talk about Lost now in an open and honest way?

42:47.120 --> 42:51.440
Well, according to the internet, it's like 35 seconds.

42:52.320 --> 42:53.680
Like Game of Thrones.

42:54.400 --> 42:55.280
Gollum died.

42:55.920 --> 42:56.880
Get it out there quick!

42:56.880 --> 42:57.360
Publish it!

42:57.360 --> 42:57.840
Get it out there!

42:57.840 --> 42:58.960
Get it out there quick!

42:58.960 --> 43:03.840
Every second we spend not writing about how Gollum just died on Game of Thrones is-

43:03.840 --> 43:05.200
We're gonna be last!

43:05.200 --> 43:06.240
We're gonna be last!

43:06.240 --> 43:06.880
Get it up!

43:06.880 --> 43:07.760
Get it up!

43:07.760 --> 43:10.320
But seriously, no Game of Thrones spoilers.

43:10.320 --> 43:12.000
I- I'm- I just started.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.360
I'm on episode two.

43:13.360 --> 43:13.680
Oh.

43:14.240 --> 43:15.440
Don't say anything.

43:15.440 --> 43:16.320
Well, Gandalf?

43:16.320 --> 43:18.080
You know Ga- You know Gandalf?

43:18.080 --> 43:19.680
Yeah, he's my favorite character.

43:19.680 --> 43:20.560
Yeah, guess what?

43:21.120 --> 43:21.440
What?

43:22.640 --> 43:26.800
He's actually a big pile of rocks.

43:28.720 --> 43:31.840
And do you know about Zelda?

43:32.560 --> 43:32.880
Yeah?

43:34.480 --> 43:38.400
She's Gandalf.

43:38.400 --> 43:40.560
Oh, twist!

43:40.560 --> 43:42.720
Are you enjoying the character of Arthax?

43:43.280 --> 43:43.840
The horse?

43:44.400 --> 43:48.320
Well, sorry, he's gonna sink into the Swarm of Sadness as the trio looks on.

43:48.880 --> 43:49.680
What?

43:49.680 --> 43:50.080
Sorry.

43:50.080 --> 43:51.600
But Jedd Stark?

43:52.240 --> 43:52.880
Uh-huh.

43:52.880 --> 43:54.160
He's actually Ned Stark.

43:54.880 --> 43:56.320
He's actually alive.

43:56.320 --> 43:58.560
You've been mishearing his name the entire time.

43:58.560 --> 43:59.200
This whole time.

44:00.240 --> 44:00.880
He's A.

44:00.880 --> 44:02.240
I turned on subtitles.

44:02.240 --> 44:03.200
He's A?

44:03.200 --> 44:04.160
Ned Stark is A.

44:04.160 --> 44:10.320
Okay, the big reveal of season six of Game of Thrones is Game of Thrones is what ties

44:10.320 --> 44:12.160
all other TV shows together.

44:12.160 --> 44:14.240
All other mediums together.

44:14.240 --> 44:17.040
Hi, my name is Zelda, and this is-

44:17.040 --> 44:18.400
This is my friend Tit Lickly.

44:18.400 --> 44:21.200
This is Tit- Hi, I'm Zelda, and this is Bart Simpson.

44:21.200 --> 44:22.240
Cowabunga, dude.

44:22.240 --> 44:23.600
That's right, Dumbledore.

44:25.280 --> 44:26.960
Welcome to my Star Wars.

44:26.960 --> 44:28.240
Come on inside.

44:28.240 --> 44:37.600
We've got a- We've got a real elo and stitch- I'm just saying shit.

44:37.600 --> 44:39.920
Welcome to the Shining Time Station, bitch.

44:42.320 --> 44:43.040
It's on.

44:43.040 --> 44:46.560
Was that the OC meets Cross Shining Time Station?

44:47.200 --> 44:50.160
I'm Ringo Starr and also George Carlin.

44:50.160 --> 44:55.120
No one can decide which of us is more improbable as the conductor of Shining Time Station.

44:55.120 --> 44:59.120
And apparently people live inside the jukebox and we didn't think that'd be scarring for

44:59.120 --> 45:01.520
children, but Travis still has nightmares about it.

45:01.520 --> 45:03.040
No one else is in that jukebox?

45:05.440 --> 45:06.640
Seventeen Candles.

45:07.360 --> 45:08.320
The movie.

45:08.320 --> 45:10.320
The sequel to Sixteen Candles.

45:10.320 --> 45:12.080
Ah, shit, you're right, Trav.

45:12.080 --> 45:13.600
One too many candelinos.

45:14.480 --> 45:15.440
One to grow on.

45:15.440 --> 45:16.800
One to grow on.

45:16.800 --> 45:17.840
It's a sequel.

45:17.840 --> 45:20.080
All your favorite characters are still in it, though.

45:20.080 --> 45:27.120
You know, Hank from Breaking Bad, Malcolm in the Middle.

45:27.840 --> 45:29.040
Malcolm in the Middle's in there.

45:30.800 --> 45:33.920
Before we end the show, I wanted to share something with you guys real quick.

45:35.200 --> 45:40.480
We've been sleep training our daughter, trying to get her to sleep better, and Sydney sent

45:40.480 --> 45:44.480
me a link to a book on Amazon while I've been here in New York trying to make it on the

45:44.480 --> 45:48.640
Great White Way, and it's called The Rabbit Who Wants to Fall Asleep, A New Way of Getting

45:48.640 --> 45:50.640
Children to Sleep, and she said, I ordered it.

45:50.640 --> 45:52.160
It looks really good, and you should read the reviews.

45:52.160 --> 45:53.040
I'm like, yeah, okay.

45:53.040 --> 45:55.200
She's like, no, trust me.

45:55.760 --> 45:56.960
Read all the reviews.

45:57.840 --> 46:03.200
So this is a book about, like, you basically read it, and it's supposed to, like, lull

46:03.200 --> 46:06.560
your child to sleep with its tempo and words and everything.

46:08.480 --> 46:16.720
And there is one one-star review on the book from a Josie who says, in all caps,

46:16.720 --> 46:21.520
it's just something like hypnotism, and hypnotism is just a deep meditation.

46:21.520 --> 46:23.520
That is the title of this review.

46:23.520 --> 46:24.320
Be careful.

46:25.120 --> 46:31.120
It's just something like hypnotism, and hypnotism is just a deep meditation, which is linked

46:31.120 --> 46:34.320
to evil spirits, which is anti-Christ.

46:34.880 --> 46:39.520
Do not put your kids into this Satan's hand, please!

46:39.520 --> 46:40.880
Exclamation point.

46:41.760 --> 46:45.600
That is their review of The Rabbit Who Wants to Fall Asleep, A New Way of Getting Children

46:45.600 --> 46:46.160
to Sleep.

46:46.160 --> 46:54.400
So you're saying this book, when you wield it, you can be like, hippity-hoppity, hippity-hoppity,

46:54.400 --> 46:56.400
watch the rabbit go.

46:56.400 --> 46:57.680
Okay, she's asleep.

46:57.680 --> 46:59.600
Steal and take drugs.

46:59.600 --> 47:00.880
Steal and take drugs.

47:00.880 --> 47:03.440
Cauti baracta onictos.

47:03.440 --> 47:04.640
Play D&D.

47:04.640 --> 47:08.160
All that shit, but also, steal drugs, bring them back to Daddy.

47:09.680 --> 47:11.280
Find out where to get the drugs.

47:11.280 --> 47:13.440
Daddy does not know where to get them no longer.

47:13.440 --> 47:15.920
Agent Baby, I need you to get these drugs.

47:15.920 --> 47:19.440
Activate the Manchurian, baby, to score me some weed.

47:19.440 --> 47:26.160
Uh, folks, we're gonna close up shop, because Justin's hotel on the Great White Way was

47:26.160 --> 47:33.520
built before electricity and broadband signals, apparently, and I think he's completely gone.

47:33.520 --> 47:34.020
Justin?

47:34.560 --> 47:35.060
Test?

47:36.000 --> 47:37.600
Yeah, I mean, I'm completely here.

47:37.600 --> 47:39.200
Fort- Niner, Niner, Niner.

47:40.640 --> 47:41.680
Sewer Shark.

47:41.680 --> 47:43.600
Uh, so we're gonna shut this shit down.

47:43.600 --> 47:44.560
Thank you for listening.

47:44.560 --> 47:46.880
Um, Justin, see, that's the problem, Justin.

47:46.880 --> 47:48.560
I don't know what you do here at the back end.

47:48.560 --> 47:51.360
I usually get out my 3DS and play Pokémon.

47:51.360 --> 47:55.120
Well, I can say that, uh, the big announcement, we've talked about it before, we'll make

47:55.120 --> 47:59.360
sure nobody misses their chance to see us, uh, we're performing at the Los Angeles

47:59.360 --> 48:00.320
Podcast Festival.

48:00.320 --> 48:01.600
Uh, it's our first time there.

48:01.600 --> 48:02.240
We're really excited.

48:02.240 --> 48:05.200
We're doing both My Brother, My Brother and Me and the Adventure Zone.

48:05.200 --> 48:09.760
It'll be the first ever and possibly only live Adventure Zone, depending on how it goes.

48:09.760 --> 48:10.260
Bad!

48:10.260 --> 48:12.720
And if you'd like to watch it, well, it might go bad.

48:12.720 --> 48:14.400
I don't know, but isn't that worth watching?

48:14.400 --> 48:18.640
Um, the best thing is, even if you're not gonna be in Los Angeles, you can watch it

48:18.640 --> 48:20.080
from anywhere in the world.

48:20.080 --> 48:27.840
If you go to LAPodfest.com and click on Live Streaming, you can, for just $20, if you use

48:27.840 --> 48:30.800
the coupon code ZONE or BROTHER, you'll get $5 off.

48:30.800 --> 48:32.320
It'll only cost you $20.

48:32.320 --> 48:36.000
You can watch the whole weekend, and I think it's archived for, like, a month.

48:36.640 --> 48:40.560

48:40.560 --> 48:43.200

48:43.200 --> 48:47.680
Not only does it save you $5, but it supports us as well, and we really appreciate it.

48:47.680 --> 48:48.640
And we really need it.

48:49.520 --> 48:50.240
We need it bad.

48:50.880 --> 48:51.920
Need it bad.

48:51.920 --> 48:55.280
We also have some live shows coming up next calendar week.

48:55.280 --> 49:01.200
We're gonna be in Portland, uh, on Friday we're gonna be in Seattle, on Saturday we're

49:01.200 --> 49:02.960
gonna be in Vancouver on Sunday.

49:02.960 --> 49:04.480
Now Portland, listen up.

49:05.200 --> 49:06.320
This is not a test.

49:06.320 --> 49:12.000
Portland people, if you're listening to this, um, on Thursday, do we know the exact time?

49:12.000 --> 49:13.040
I'm looking right now.

49:13.040 --> 49:13.280
Okay.

49:13.280 --> 49:15.120
I think it's noon Pacific Standard Time.

49:15.120 --> 49:19.040
Well, look that shit up for sure, cause I'm not gonna screw over our people here.

49:19.040 --> 49:23.360
Uh, we're gonna open up a few tickets in, in Portland.

49:23.360 --> 49:27.600
Uh, we're actually gonna open up a few more tickets in Seattle and Vancouver as well.

49:27.600 --> 49:33.360
Um, but Portland has been sold out for months, and if you live there and are bummed, this

49:33.360 --> 49:36.320
will be a chance, this will be a chance to get a ticket.

49:36.320 --> 49:36.720
Uh...

49:36.720 --> 49:37.680
Now here's the thing.

49:37.680 --> 49:39.680
It is noon on Thursday.

49:39.680 --> 49:43.840
We've had some issues before of, like, them going up a couple minutes before, a couple

49:43.840 --> 49:44.400
minutes after.

49:44.400 --> 49:45.600
We don't have any control of it.

49:45.600 --> 49:47.440
So I would say start looking at, like, 11.

49:47.440 --> 49:52.640
And, like, this, this is straight up, like, I, I don't wanna give anybody false hope.

49:52.640 --> 49:56.720
This is, like, golden ticket level, um, availability.

49:56.720 --> 49:58.640
Uh, there, there are not that many.

49:58.640 --> 50:00.400
But, uh, you, you'll have your chance.

50:00.400 --> 50:02.560
It's bit.ly forward slash...

50:02.560 --> 50:04.320
God, it's been so long since we've had tickets.

50:04.320 --> 50:05.200
I don't remember the link.

50:05.200 --> 50:06.960
I think it's NBAA in Portland, isn't it?

50:06.960 --> 50:11.360
Yeah, the link is bit.ly forward slash NBAA in Portland.

50:11.360 --> 50:13.200
Um, so, so look that up.

50:13.760 --> 50:14.880
Are you sure about the time?

50:15.600 --> 50:16.240
Yes.

50:16.240 --> 50:18.240
Thursday, noon Pacific.

50:18.800 --> 50:19.280
Correct.

50:19.280 --> 50:19.760
Go place some tickets.

50:19.760 --> 50:21.840
Start checking minutes before.

50:21.840 --> 50:25.280
If you live in Seattle or Vancouver, there's still tickets available for you, you guys.

50:25.280 --> 50:31.440
Uh, it's bit.ly forward slash NBAA in Seattle and bit.ly forward slash van NBAA in.

50:32.000 --> 50:32.640
Um...

50:32.640 --> 50:36.240
We wanna say thank you to everybody who's been sending us awesome shit through the P.O.

50:36.240 --> 50:36.880
boxes.

50:36.880 --> 50:41.120
We got a box of stuff from Stephanie, uh, who got us each, like, personalized thing.

50:41.120 --> 50:45.440
Griffin got you an awesome, like, Griffin-themed T-shirt that you're gonna dig.

50:45.440 --> 50:46.080
I'll bring that with me to the live show.

50:46.080 --> 50:46.580
Yay!

50:47.280 --> 50:52.160
Justin, some, um, some Margaritaville merchandise.

50:53.280 --> 50:53.840
Uh, it's pretty sweet.

50:53.840 --> 50:54.480
Excellent.

50:54.480 --> 51:00.080
And got me some nail wraps and, uh, a nail, uh, wrap humidor.

51:00.080 --> 51:04.320
Um, along with some other really fun stuff that I'll bring and distribute out to everybody.

51:04.320 --> 51:07.120
Uh, Juice, have we gotten anything in the...

51:07.120 --> 51:12.480
Yeah, I wanted to thank, uh, Zoe Kinski climbing that ladder, sent me some Seafoam candy and

51:12.480 --> 51:15.600
a horse candy dish, which is just beautiful.

51:15.600 --> 51:20.800
And, uh, a company called Amoretti sent some coffee syrups that I've been using to make

51:20.800 --> 51:21.680
cocktails.

51:21.680 --> 51:23.040
Check out P.O. Box here in Austin.

51:23.040 --> 51:24.480
I feel like I'm missing the wave.

51:24.480 --> 51:25.280
You should, man.

51:25.280 --> 51:25.840
It's awesome.

51:25.840 --> 51:26.480
It's Southern.

51:26.480 --> 51:27.440
You can be the Southern HQ.

51:27.440 --> 51:28.480
I like presents.

51:28.480 --> 51:33.120
That way, when presents come for you guys, I can just throw them right in the trash.

51:33.120 --> 51:34.080
Or into your mouth.

51:34.080 --> 51:35.280
If it's Seafoam candy.

51:35.840 --> 51:36.880
Delicious candy.

51:37.840 --> 51:43.920
If you want to send something to the West Coast HQ, uh, you can send it to P.O. Box 341769,

Um, if you want a message in the Money Zone, go to MaximumFun.org slash Jumbotron.

52:02.160 --> 52:06.960
Uh, be aware there's kind of a backup, kind of a queue, as they would say, in the aisles.

52:06.960 --> 52:09.840
Um, but, uh, go there and get a message on the show.

52:09.840 --> 52:12.240
Uh, and go listen to all the other MaxFun shows.

52:12.240 --> 52:13.520
There's new MaxFun shows.

52:13.520 --> 52:16.000
If you've been listening to the network for a while, go check them out.

52:16.000 --> 52:20.080
There's We Got This, starring Hal Lublin and Mark Gagliardi.

52:20.080 --> 52:23.360
Uh, Travis produces a new podcast called Can I Pet Your Dog?

52:23.920 --> 52:25.520
Um, there's, there's a lot of stuff.

52:25.520 --> 52:25.760
And-

52:25.760 --> 52:30.720
And if you're a fan of Lin's, Lin Manuel Miranda, friend of the show, he's on the first episode

52:30.720 --> 52:32.800
of Can I Pet Your Dog, talking about his dog, Toby.

52:32.800 --> 52:33.920
And it's wonderful.

52:33.920 --> 52:35.200
His dog is adorable.

52:35.200 --> 52:41.120
The news just dropped that, uh, our buddy Lin's doing a new, uh, uh, Disney flick.

52:41.120 --> 52:41.600
Yeah.

52:41.600 --> 52:42.240
That's crazy.

52:42.240 --> 52:42.720
Yeah, you know-

52:42.720 --> 52:44.560
And they're recording the Hamilton album.

52:44.560 --> 52:47.040
And Hamilton is basically the greatest show anyone's ever seen.

52:47.040 --> 52:48.640
He's going places and he's the best dude.

52:48.640 --> 52:55.600
But you guys realize we are now going to be one degree away from Dwayne the Rock Johnson.

52:55.600 --> 52:57.360
Dwayne the Rock Johnson.

52:57.360 --> 53:00.400
Listen, Lin, if you're listening, it is your job

53:00.400 --> 53:03.920
to put earbuds into his head and play My Brother, My Brother, Me for him.

53:03.920 --> 53:04.640
It's going to be tough.

53:04.640 --> 53:05.920
He's a big, strong man.

53:05.920 --> 53:08.880
You are going to have to climb him Shadow of the Colossus style.

53:08.880 --> 53:11.520
Guys, guys, I just had the best idea.

53:11.520 --> 53:12.160
Okay.

53:12.160 --> 53:16.800
We need to do an episode specifically-

53:16.800 --> 53:19.120
It'll start out with us like, no, don't take him out.

53:19.120 --> 53:20.320
Dwayne, listen, Dwayne, listen.

53:20.960 --> 53:22.960
Listen, this is a genius idea.

53:23.760 --> 53:27.440
This is a show, an episode of My Brother, My Brother, Me, a full hour,

53:27.440 --> 53:32.960
specifically targeted at Dwayne the Rock Johnson and his illustrious career

53:32.960 --> 53:36.080
and really getting him like deep into the show.

53:36.080 --> 53:36.800
Yeah, don't panic.

53:37.600 --> 53:38.560
Don't panic, Dwayne.

53:38.560 --> 53:39.680
This feels uncomfortable.

53:39.680 --> 53:45.040
The point will be we get Lin to plug him in to his cavernous ears

53:45.680 --> 53:47.440
while he's sleeping on set, right?

53:47.440 --> 53:48.240
Maybe taking a nap.

53:48.240 --> 53:50.720
So maybe we come in soft like, Dwayne.

53:50.720 --> 53:51.920
Dwayne, wake up.

53:52.640 --> 53:53.840
Dwayne, you're fine.

53:53.840 --> 53:55.520
Don't take the headphones off, Dwayne.

53:55.520 --> 53:57.440
We live inside you now.

53:57.440 --> 53:59.040
Dwayne, we interspaced in you.

53:59.040 --> 54:00.720
We got lost because there's a lot.

54:01.520 --> 54:03.360
There's a lot to explore, Dwayne.

54:03.360 --> 54:04.880
We need you to sneeze, Dwayne.

54:05.760 --> 54:07.520
We know you've never sneezed before in your life.

54:07.520 --> 54:08.480
We read it on your Wikipedia page.

54:08.480 --> 54:11.680
But first, first, do you like ghost jokes?

54:13.680 --> 54:15.680
Dwayne, we've made an episode just for you.

54:16.880 --> 54:17.680
This is going to be great.

54:17.680 --> 54:21.440
It's going to be probably our best episode since the Totino's episode ever.

54:22.480 --> 54:24.880
Thanks to John Roderick also in the Longwinter Reviews for a theme song.

54:24.880 --> 54:26.880
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

54:26.880 --> 54:28.160
It's a great album.

54:28.160 --> 54:30.800
I saw somebody got recommended that album on Spotify.

54:30.800 --> 54:32.000
Keep up the good work, Spotify.

54:32.640 --> 54:35.040
You're doing it good, but don't stream it.

54:35.040 --> 54:35.600
Buy the album.

54:36.160 --> 54:37.280
Forget you, Spotify.

54:37.280 --> 54:37.840
Buy the album.

54:38.400 --> 54:40.720

We have lots of like animated shorts and shareable shorts.

54:46.240 --> 54:48.160
I'll probably put Titliquid on there.

54:48.160 --> 54:50.560
It's made me very happy and I'm probably going to turn that into a short.

54:50.560 --> 54:51.440
That's a good IP.

54:51.440 --> 54:52.480
Let's shut her down.

54:53.120 --> 54:53.680
Yeah, we're done.

54:53.680 --> 54:56.560

we were recording the show this week.

55:45.760 --> 55:50.080

56:14.480 --> 56:15.120
the show.

56:15.120 --> 56:16.000

56:35.200 --> 56:36.560
to seize today.

56:36.560 --> 56:38.080
You're a taxpayer, right?

56:38.080 --> 56:39.680
Well, then you've got it coming.
