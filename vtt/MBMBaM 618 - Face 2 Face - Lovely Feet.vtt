00:00.000 --> 00:09.760
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:09.760 --> 00:19.120
Travis claims he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:19.120 --> 00:24.760
Also this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how

00:24.760 --> 00:28.040
cool they are for listening.

00:28.040 --> 00:30.400
What's up, you cool babies?

00:59.040 --> 01:02.040
It's better, it's better with you.

01:02.040 --> 01:08.040
My life, it's better, it's better with you.

01:08.040 --> 01:14.040
This is true, it's better, it's better with you.

01:14.040 --> 01:21.040
My life, it's better with you.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.040
Welcome, my brother, my brother, me to my show for the modern era.

01:23.040 --> 01:33.040
I'm your oldest brother, Dustin McElroy!

01:33.040 --> 01:42.040
And I am Travis the Middle-est.

01:42.040 --> 01:44.040
I don't need it, I already had you.

01:44.040 --> 01:47.040
I already had you in the opener, I don't need it, I'm Griffin.

01:47.040 --> 01:50.040
I don't need it, I already had it.

01:50.040 --> 01:54.040
Mm, yum yum, secondsies.

01:54.040 --> 01:57.040
Second breakfast, yum yum.

01:57.040 --> 02:01.040
I know, I hate to embarrass him, but Alan, is Alan here?

02:01.040 --> 02:03.040
You gotta be more specific than that, it is not-

02:03.040 --> 02:07.040
No, Alan, he was my Uber driver, I told him I'd put him on the list.

02:07.040 --> 02:11.040
He drove me from the airport, Alan.

02:11.040 --> 02:13.040
Alan, my Uber driver, he said he definitely-

02:13.040 --> 02:15.040
You drive for Uber?

02:15.040 --> 02:17.040
Your name is Alan?

02:17.040 --> 02:19.040
No no no, I'm sorry, Lyft.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.040
Alan from Lyft?

02:20.040 --> 02:22.040
That was a confusion.

02:22.040 --> 02:25.040
Can you imagine Alan was sitting there like, oh, but I was Lyft.

02:25.040 --> 02:28.040
Alan, I put him on the list.

02:28.040 --> 02:31.040
Did he say, I'll be sure to make it?

02:31.040 --> 02:33.040
He said, I will definitely try to make it.

02:33.040 --> 02:36.040
Oh, what's that, Justin, your family's not traveling with you this time?

02:36.040 --> 02:37.040
I'll be there, don't worry.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.040
Yeah, I'll be there to support you.

02:38.040 --> 02:39.040
I'll be your family.

02:39.040 --> 02:40.040
Alan.

02:40.040 --> 02:41.040
Oh man, Alan?

02:41.040 --> 02:42.040
He says his own name like a Pokemon.

02:42.040 --> 02:46.040
It might have been Alon, A-L-A-N, Alan.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.040
I mean, any form of that.

02:47.040 --> 02:50.040
Alan, if you drove me in your car.

02:50.040 --> 02:52.040
Alan?

02:52.040 --> 02:54.040
Is there an Alan here?

02:54.040 --> 02:55.040
Alan?

02:55.040 --> 02:58.040
Hey, middle name, middle name Alan.

02:58.040 --> 03:00.040
What's up, Alan?

03:00.040 --> 03:04.040
Hey, a little shaky ride today, please.

03:04.040 --> 03:05.040
Thank you, Alan.

03:05.040 --> 03:08.040
If you could try to not take those turns quite so tight.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.040
Thank you.

03:09.040 --> 03:13.040
Sorry to put you on blast.

03:13.040 --> 03:18.040
I actually did meet a fellow at the Atlanta airport today.

03:18.040 --> 03:20.040
Hey, what's going on?

03:20.040 --> 03:21.040
What?

03:21.040 --> 03:25.040
He did come, and I saw him, and he was like, hey, are you Justin Smacker?

03:25.040 --> 03:26.040
I was like, yes, I am.

03:26.040 --> 03:28.040
We exchanged blood and truths, and he said, I'm going to St. Louis.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.040
I said, me too.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.040
I said, you should go to the show.

03:30.040 --> 03:32.040
He said, yeah, I should.

03:32.040 --> 03:36.040
And before he could say anything else, I said, I'll leave you a free ticket.

03:36.040 --> 03:42.040
And then as I was walking up the stairs, I thought, why did I do that?

03:42.040 --> 03:44.040
I should have made him buy a ticket.

03:44.040 --> 03:45.040
Why did I give him a free ticket?

03:45.040 --> 03:47.040
You took money out of our pockets with that.

03:47.040 --> 03:49.040
Yeah, that was rude of me.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.040
It was rude.

03:50.040 --> 03:51.040
I'm glad you could make it, though.

03:51.040 --> 03:57.040
So this is an advice show.

03:57.040 --> 04:01.040
But this is a last bit, I promise.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.040
This is the last bit for the evening, I promise.

04:03.040 --> 04:04.040
No more bits for the rest of the evening.

04:04.040 --> 04:10.040
Is anybody here in town for what is called Shutterfest that just happened to also realize there's...

04:10.040 --> 04:11.040
Okay.

04:11.040 --> 04:16.040
There's a photography convention happening at our hotel where we live and sleep and eat

04:16.040 --> 04:23.040
and walk through the hallway in our pajama pants like a Bigfoot on a Sunday afternoon.

04:23.040 --> 04:29.040
And the number of times I have just lumbered through a door into like a wedding shoot

04:29.040 --> 04:34.040
or a boudoir session in the middle of a hotel hallway.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.040
The boudoir sessions are wild.

04:36.040 --> 04:38.040
There is a restaurant like 10 feet.

04:38.040 --> 04:41.040
I'm just trying to go eat some buffalo chicken sandwich.

04:41.040 --> 04:43.040
And there's a boudoir shoot.

04:43.040 --> 04:44.040
You have boudoirs.

04:44.040 --> 04:47.040
It's a hotel, buddy, a boudoir.

04:47.040 --> 04:51.040
Before I knew that the thing was going on, when we first got to the hotel,

04:51.040 --> 04:54.040
we came up and we got out of the elevator and I'm pushing a stroller

04:54.040 --> 04:58.040
and I've just gotten off an airplane and I feel like a big piece of crud.

04:58.040 --> 05:01.040
And right as we open the door to like try to squeeze our stroller through,

05:01.040 --> 05:05.040
there just appears to be a goddess just like standing.

05:05.040 --> 05:08.040
And I was like, oh, hi, hey.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.040
And she just goes, oh, you can go.

05:10.040 --> 05:11.040
I was like, okay.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.040
Let me just round you.

05:13.040 --> 05:15.040
Thank you for this blessing on this thing.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.040
Thank you.

05:17.040 --> 05:18.040
Thank you.

05:18.040 --> 05:20.040
What should I do now, man?

05:20.040 --> 05:25.040
Okay, so we asked you, the people of St. Louis, for questions that we could help with.

05:25.040 --> 05:26.040
Holy shit.

05:26.040 --> 05:28.040
Y'all sending a lot of stuff.

05:28.040 --> 05:31.040
This is either like very participatory, which I love,

05:31.040 --> 05:34.040
but you also have a lot of problems.

05:34.040 --> 05:39.040
A lot of socially uncomfortable slash awkward stuff happens in St. Louis, it seems.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.040
Yeah, a lot of people need our...

05:40.040 --> 05:41.040
St. Louis, you need help?

05:41.040 --> 05:43.040
Oh, thank you for asking.

05:43.040 --> 05:47.040
The original name of the film was Meet Me in St. Louis, if it's convenient.

05:47.040 --> 05:50.040
I mean, if you're already going to St. Louis, it would be cool to hook up,

05:50.040 --> 05:51.040
but it's fine if you're busy.

05:51.040 --> 05:54.040
And once you're there, we have some stuff to talk about.

05:54.040 --> 05:57.040
We got to shoot some real shit.

05:57.040 --> 05:59.040
So here, let's get into it.

05:59.040 --> 06:00.040
Okay, please.

06:00.040 --> 06:02.040
Oh, wait a minute.

06:02.040 --> 06:05.040
It occurs to me that we've been off the road for two years,

06:05.040 --> 06:10.040
so I can say now that much like the Chilean miners,

06:10.040 --> 06:15.040
we have reemerged from the depths of the earth

06:15.040 --> 06:18.040
to appear before you here in St. Louis.

06:18.040 --> 06:20.040
Now we can begin the show in earnest.

06:20.040 --> 06:25.040
I celebrated my five-year wedding anniversary in November.

06:25.040 --> 06:26.040
Not Justin.

06:26.040 --> 06:28.040
I didn't.

06:28.040 --> 06:29.040
This is someone here.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.040
Don't cheer for them.

06:31.040 --> 06:33.040
They're not up here.

06:33.040 --> 06:34.040
They're not up here.

06:34.040 --> 06:35.040
Who's that?

06:35.040 --> 06:39.040
This is important to the story because I found the thank you notes

06:39.040 --> 06:44.040
I wrote for my wedding gifts in my garage when I moved earlier this year.

06:44.040 --> 06:52.040
They are all, get this, written, sealed, addressed, and even include postage.

06:52.040 --> 06:56.040
Somehow I just forgot the last step, sending them.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.040
The easiest step, one might say.

06:58.040 --> 07:00.040
The most satisfying one.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.040
What's better than that?

07:01.040 --> 07:04.040
Literally the only step someone else does for you.

07:04.040 --> 07:07.040
You hand them off to a government worker who takes them away

07:07.040 --> 07:08.040
and takes care of them for you.

07:08.040 --> 07:13.040
They took hours to write, and I want to get credit for all of that work,

07:13.040 --> 07:17.040
but I also don't want to remind my judgy family

07:17.040 --> 07:20.040
that they never did get those thank you notes.

07:20.040 --> 07:23.040
I bet they've been talking about it behind my back this whole time.

07:23.040 --> 07:25.040
They have.

07:25.040 --> 07:29.040
Brothers, do I send these old super out-of-date notes anyway,

07:29.040 --> 07:34.040
or should I cut my losses and toss them, hoping no one remembers by now?

07:34.040 --> 07:36.040
Everyone remembers.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.040
Everyone remembers.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.040
They'll never forget.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.040
It's the worst thing that's ever happened.

07:40.040 --> 07:42.040
That's from losing some laurels in Lake St. Louis.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.040
Are you here?

07:43.040 --> 07:45.040
All right.

07:45.040 --> 07:48.040
Now, it is possible that the family has forgotten,

07:48.040 --> 07:51.040
but they've only forgotten on the surface level,

07:51.040 --> 07:54.040
and then deep in their subconscious, when they think about you,

07:54.040 --> 07:56.040
they're like, no, I don't like them.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.040
I don't know why.

07:58.040 --> 08:00.040
And I don't enjoy them.

08:00.040 --> 08:02.040
I'm going to save you a lot of time.

08:02.040 --> 08:04.040
I can actually fix this one pretty easily.

08:04.040 --> 08:05.040
Okay, great.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.040
Get on internet.

08:06.040 --> 08:08.040
Go to the stamp place where you get rubber stamps.

08:08.040 --> 08:10.040
Not stamp stamps, rubber stamps.

08:10.040 --> 08:12.040
That's confusing when it comes to envelopes.

08:12.040 --> 08:14.040
That's why I clarified.

08:14.040 --> 08:18.040
Get a rubber stamp that says Post Office Error,

08:18.040 --> 08:22.040
and then stamp it on every single one.

08:22.040 --> 08:24.040
Just stamp it.

08:24.040 --> 08:25.040
This is doable.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.040
This is doable and practical.

08:26.040 --> 08:27.040
This is foolproof.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.040
One question, though.

08:29.040 --> 08:33.040
What agency will then deliver those for real?

08:33.040 --> 08:35.040
I had not thought about that.

08:35.040 --> 08:36.040
Okay.

08:36.040 --> 08:39.040
And also, Justin, in this rich fiction you've created,

08:39.040 --> 08:42.040
the Post Office is also like, oh, man, we fucked up.

08:42.040 --> 08:44.040
Get the stamp.

08:44.040 --> 08:45.040
Let them know we fucked up.

08:45.040 --> 08:47.040
The whoopsie stamp.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.040
Why not just dip it?

08:48.040 --> 08:53.040
Unless there's a second government agency that just looks over

08:53.040 --> 08:55.040
what the Post Office does and goes, oh, they fucked up again.

08:55.040 --> 08:59.040
I think that's what the Postmaster General does, I'm pretty sure.

08:59.040 --> 09:03.040
I'd love to hear what else you think the Postmaster General does.

09:03.040 --> 09:07.040
Well, when people come to wage war on the Post Office,

09:07.040 --> 09:09.040
he commands the troops.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.040
Also, he's in charge of the court marshals.

09:11.040 --> 09:12.040
Right.

09:12.040 --> 09:16.040
You could also dip it in old coffee and then dry that out

09:16.040 --> 09:19.040
and, like, burn the edges like an old treasure map.

09:19.040 --> 09:21.040
And I don't know what the story is there,

09:21.040 --> 09:22.040
but people will receive it and be like,

09:22.040 --> 09:24.040
look at this busted-ass old mail I got.

09:24.040 --> 09:25.040
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:25.040 --> 09:28.040
But, like, you need a postmark from, like, Borneo or something.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.040
Apparently, get that at the same place you got this number stamp

09:30.040 --> 09:32.040
that says Post Office there.

09:32.040 --> 09:34.040
Just stamp that on there like, oh, they must have sent it to Borneo.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.040
Yeah.

09:35.040 --> 09:36.040
Another Post Office error.

09:36.040 --> 09:37.040
Yeah.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.040
Right.

09:38.040 --> 09:41.040
Thanks for the free mail, hashtag pirates.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.040
Yeah.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.040
I don't know why they would put a hashtag.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.040
A dash would have made more sense.

09:44.040 --> 09:45.040
Well, they're trying to build up their S.E.O.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.040
Right.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.040
Can you just handwrite a little note then that says, like,

09:48.040 --> 09:50.040
sorry, Post Office Greg.

09:50.040 --> 09:52.040
Like, sorry, says Post Office Greg.

09:52.040 --> 09:53.040
I'm sorry.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.040
My fault.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.040
My fault.

09:55.040 --> 09:56.040
Please don't tell the general.

09:56.040 --> 09:59.040
Oh, what about this?

09:59.040 --> 10:01.040
You're going to need to travel a lot for this,

10:01.040 --> 10:03.040
but go to each of their houses individually,

10:03.040 --> 10:06.040
slip it somewhere in the house, and then be like,

10:06.040 --> 10:08.040
you got that letter, right?

10:08.040 --> 10:09.040
And they're like, no, I never got it.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.040
And they're like, are you sure?

10:11.040 --> 10:12.040
Check around.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.040
Maybe under that book.

10:14.040 --> 10:18.040
You are going to go to all of their houses individually?

10:18.040 --> 10:19.040
Yeah.

10:19.040 --> 10:21.040
You're going to invite yourself over for no reason at all?

10:21.040 --> 10:22.040
Yeah.

10:22.040 --> 10:24.040
And then they'll be like, who is this?

10:24.040 --> 10:25.040
I actually don't like you.

10:25.040 --> 10:27.040
I don't remember why.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.040
I'm pretty sure Travis is suggesting a reverse burglary.

10:29.040 --> 10:30.040
Yeah.

10:30.040 --> 10:31.040
Right.

10:31.040 --> 10:34.040
You could also just throw it in the window tied to a brick.

10:34.040 --> 10:37.040
And they'll be like, what the fuck?

10:37.040 --> 10:38.040
Oh, it is the thank you note.

10:38.040 --> 10:40.040
I have been waiting on that.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.040
Just drive by and chuck it into their lawn

10:42.040 --> 10:44.040
or behind some ferns or something.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.040
Really?

10:45.040 --> 10:46.040
Let me help you look for it.

10:46.040 --> 10:47.040
Yeah.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.040
Tear it up a little bit.

10:48.040 --> 10:49.040
Why is that better than what I said?

10:49.040 --> 10:50.040
What?

10:50.040 --> 10:52.040
Because yours is inside the house.

10:52.040 --> 10:53.040
Fair enough.

10:53.040 --> 10:54.040
Fair enough.

10:54.040 --> 10:57.040
You can tear it up a little bit and put it in a dog house.

10:57.040 --> 10:59.040
And then it's a dog's fault.

10:59.040 --> 11:00.040
That's good.

11:00.040 --> 11:03.040
Dogs love that, to eat mail.

11:03.040 --> 11:04.040
It wasn't me, I swear.

11:04.040 --> 11:07.040
Why do you think they attack postal service workers?

11:07.040 --> 11:09.040
Is it because they want access to that delicious mail?

11:09.040 --> 11:11.040
They're the ones waging war on the post office.

11:11.040 --> 11:14.040
The postmaster general fights the dogs.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.040
It's science.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.040
Look it up.

11:16.040 --> 11:18.040
Read a history book.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.040
How about another question?

11:19.040 --> 11:20.040
I would adore that.

11:20.040 --> 11:21.040
Who?

11:21.040 --> 11:22.040
What?

11:22.040 --> 11:23.040
I want it.

11:23.040 --> 11:24.040
I want it so bad.

11:24.040 --> 11:25.040
Okay.

11:25.040 --> 11:26.040
The other day some pals...

11:26.040 --> 11:27.040
Just a t-shirt, huh?

11:27.040 --> 11:28.040
Does she...

11:28.040 --> 11:29.040
Just a t-shirt?

11:29.040 --> 11:32.040
The other day some pals and I were watching TV...

11:32.040 --> 11:37.040
I don't know where you get a suit.

11:37.040 --> 11:38.040
You're in 35!

11:38.040 --> 11:42.040
Is it still the Macy's clearance rack?

11:42.040 --> 11:45.040
I went to Skeffington's in Huntington.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.040
You can just do that.

11:46.040 --> 11:48.040
Did you expect?

11:48.040 --> 11:50.040
You know Skeffington's?

11:50.040 --> 11:53.040
Some Skeffings in the house!

11:53.040 --> 11:54.040
Real Skeffheads!

11:54.040 --> 11:58.040
Their slogan is, when you're too far from being a menswear, come to Skeffington's.

11:58.040 --> 12:02.040
Because those are the two stores that you can do a tuxedo in Huntington.

12:02.040 --> 12:05.040
So I went and when I walked in the door she said,

12:05.040 --> 12:09.040
Are you here to get something for the prom?

12:09.040 --> 12:12.040
Huh.

12:12.040 --> 12:15.040
Am I here to get...

12:15.040 --> 12:19.040
You see me, right?

12:19.040 --> 12:22.040
Am I here to get something for the prom?

12:22.040 --> 12:26.040
No, I'm a 41 year old man.

12:26.040 --> 12:29.040
No, I'm not here to get something for the prom.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.040
So they hooked me up with this.

12:30.040 --> 12:32.040
You look like a million bucks.

12:32.040 --> 12:33.040
Yeah, I asked for tails.

12:33.040 --> 12:34.040
They didn't have them.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.040
Next time maybe.

12:35.040 --> 12:36.040
Okay.

12:36.040 --> 12:39.040
The other day some pals and I were watching TV at my friend's house.

12:39.040 --> 12:42.040
One of my friends left to use the bathroom.

12:42.040 --> 12:46.040
And a minute later I felt someone lean over behind me and whisper,

12:46.040 --> 12:49.040
What are you watching?

12:49.040 --> 12:55.040
Assuming it was a friend, I put them in a one-armed headlock without looking back.

12:55.040 --> 13:05.040
After a moment of dead silence, I looked back to see I was holding my friend's dad by the neck.

13:05.040 --> 13:07.040
I apologize profusely, but I can't...

13:07.040 --> 13:09.040
Why?

13:09.040 --> 13:10.040
But I can't help...

13:10.040 --> 13:11.040
You did the right...

13:11.040 --> 13:12.040
Correct.

13:12.040 --> 13:13.040
But I did...

13:13.040 --> 13:16.040
But I can't help but feel like I have screwed up irreparably.

13:16.040 --> 13:18.040
Brothers, what can I do to repair this relationship?

13:18.040 --> 13:24.040
I go to their house all the time and I want to be able to look in this man's eyes without dying of shame.

13:24.040 --> 13:27.040
That's from Strangling in St. Louis.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.040
Are you...

13:28.040 --> 13:30.040
Are you here?

13:30.040 --> 13:31.040
You did nothing wrong.

13:31.040 --> 13:32.040
Yeah.

13:32.040 --> 13:34.040
Hey, listen, real quick PSA.

13:34.040 --> 13:38.040
If you're sitting behind that person,

13:38.040 --> 13:41.040
keep the whispering to a minimum because apparently they're headlock happy.

13:41.040 --> 13:43.040
Just lean forward and just go,

13:43.040 --> 13:48.040
Werenbergs.

13:48.040 --> 13:49.040
Don't do that.

13:49.040 --> 13:50.040
Don't do that.

13:50.040 --> 13:55.040
I also, and this is not a criticism of the two question askers so far,

13:55.040 --> 13:58.040
if anything, I'm so delighted by it because, you know,

13:58.040 --> 14:01.040
it's been a while since you all have been to a live event.

14:01.040 --> 14:06.040
But the screams of acknowledgement have been so anguished.

14:06.040 --> 14:12.040
Well, it's when you hear your problem said out loud in front of a lot of people.

14:12.040 --> 14:13.040
Yeah, that's a fair point.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.040
What have I done?

14:14.040 --> 14:17.040
I also have not been asked to scream in a large crowd in a while.

14:17.040 --> 14:20.040
I don't know what would come out of me if the moment came.

14:20.040 --> 14:21.040
Okay, we do need to clarify.

14:21.040 --> 14:24.040
We're going to get to the advice in just a second.

14:24.040 --> 14:27.040
What were you watching?

14:27.040 --> 14:28.040
Our Flag Means Death.

14:28.040 --> 14:29.040
Our Flag Means Death.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.040
Excellent choice.

14:30.040 --> 14:33.040
Okay.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.040
Excellent choice.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.040
Been enjoying that lately myself.

14:35.040 --> 14:38.040
That's not relevant.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.040
It's just a good show.

14:40.040 --> 14:49.040
The father of your friend needs to figure out how to look in your eyes without dying of shame.

14:49.040 --> 14:52.040
Because you got him.

14:52.040 --> 14:54.040
You got him so fucking good.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.040
You got him.

14:55.040 --> 14:58.040
He was sneaking up on you trying to get all up in your business.

14:58.040 --> 14:59.040
Got him.

14:59.040 --> 15:00.040
You got him.

15:00.040 --> 15:04.040
That moment of silence that you thought was awkward because you got someone in a headlong

15:04.040 --> 15:07.040
was actually awkward because he was thinking, oh, that got me.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.040
It got me good.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.040
I have been gotten.

15:10.040 --> 15:13.040
That moment of like, I'm going to lean forward and ask them what they're watching.

15:13.040 --> 15:14.040
I don't want to scare them.

15:14.040 --> 15:15.040
I'm going to ask you to quietly grab.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.040
Oh, man, I fucked up.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.040
Is exactly what they were thinking.

15:18.040 --> 15:19.040
I guarantee it.

15:19.040 --> 15:22.040
If anything, you've done him a service because he needs to know that that is not acceptable

15:22.040 --> 15:23.040
under any situation.

15:23.040 --> 15:28.040
To lean close enough to be able to grab someone in a war, that's right here.

15:28.040 --> 15:29.040
Yeah.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.040
That's here.

15:30.040 --> 15:35.040
If you're in the combat zone, you will receive combat.

15:35.040 --> 15:40.040
That only is okay if you're the parrot that lives on my shoulder asking me what I'm watching.

15:40.040 --> 15:43.040
That's the only time that's acceptable, and I'm still going to get that guy in a headlock.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.040
I am so appreciative you came tonight.

15:45.040 --> 15:46.040
I was thinking about pirates.

15:46.040 --> 15:47.040
Yeah, sure.

15:47.040 --> 15:50.040
I'm so appreciative you came tonight and for your patronage.

15:50.040 --> 15:59.040
I would suggest humbly, it may be time to revisit your headlock policy in general.

15:59.040 --> 16:03.040
Just broadly speaking, there is a very different version of this question.

16:03.040 --> 16:08.040
It's like, I just asked my friend what they were watching, and they put me in a headlock.

16:08.040 --> 16:09.040
Is that okay?

16:09.040 --> 16:10.040
Is that normal?

16:10.040 --> 16:15.040
There is a wide gulf, Justin, between, hey, what are you watching over there?

16:15.040 --> 16:17.040
What are you watching?

16:17.040 --> 16:18.040
Yeah, see, I wanted to do it.

16:18.040 --> 16:19.040
You see?

16:19.040 --> 16:21.040
He almost did it.

16:21.040 --> 16:25.040
There is also a different scenario in which you uppercutted your friend's den, and instead,

16:25.040 --> 16:27.040
it was just the one on our headlock.

16:27.040 --> 16:29.040
So, I think you got off easy, and so did he.

16:29.040 --> 16:30.040
Yeah.

16:30.040 --> 16:35.040
Was it a particularly raunchy, erotic scene of Our Flag Means Death that you were like,

16:35.040 --> 16:43.040
kind of like, you got caught watching something that had like a, you know, a breast or...

16:43.040 --> 16:44.040
Have you watched the show?

16:44.040 --> 16:47.040
No.

16:47.040 --> 16:50.040
You're saying it doesn't rock like that?

16:50.040 --> 16:52.040
Not as a rule, no.

16:52.040 --> 16:55.040
It's more subtextual.

16:55.040 --> 16:57.040
Okay, all right.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.040
Well, that's a shame, right?

16:59.040 --> 17:02.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:02.040 --> 17:03.040
What is this?

17:03.040 --> 17:06.040
So, this is my new guy.

17:06.040 --> 17:10.040
In the two-year break, I've been working on this new guy.

17:10.040 --> 17:11.040
Tell me all about him.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.040
I'm obsessed.

17:12.040 --> 17:16.040
Well, you know what he's into, so I don't know what else there is to say about him.

17:16.040 --> 17:18.040
Hey, can we talk to the wizard for a moment?

17:18.040 --> 17:19.040
Sure.

17:19.040 --> 17:21.040
Mighty Throne.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.040
Paul, can I have some white wine components?

17:24.040 --> 17:25.040
Thank you.

17:25.040 --> 17:27.040
And may I have my other can?

17:27.040 --> 17:29.040
Thank you.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.040
Do mine first, Paul.

17:31.040 --> 17:32.040
It's not a race, Paul.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.040
I don't need mine, Paul.

17:33.040 --> 17:37.040
I'm drinking responsibly, like it says right here on the can.

17:37.040 --> 17:40.040
You didn't see him backstage.

17:40.040 --> 17:41.040
Don't applaud for him.

17:41.040 --> 17:43.040
He's an animal.

17:43.040 --> 17:45.040
Thank you, Paul.

17:45.040 --> 17:46.040
Thank you.

17:46.040 --> 17:47.040
No, no, no.

17:47.040 --> 17:50.040
Please, thank you.

17:50.040 --> 17:52.040
Watch what Justin does.

17:52.040 --> 17:54.040
One sec.

17:54.040 --> 17:58.040
Oh, rip that shit.

17:58.040 --> 18:00.040
That is the sound of comedy.

18:00.040 --> 18:05.040
Now, if you've been watching Justin swirl his drink, just know that this is what he's been swirling.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.040
They know.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.040
They know how we do it.

18:07.040 --> 18:10.040
It's to avoid the stratification.

18:10.040 --> 18:12.040
White Claw and Red Wine want to stay.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.040
It's on white.

18:13.040 --> 18:14.040
You just leave the can.

18:14.040 --> 18:15.040
Thank you.

18:15.040 --> 18:16.040
Can I keep the can?

18:16.040 --> 18:17.040
Thank you.

18:17.040 --> 18:19.040
Red Wine and White Claw like to naturally separate.

18:19.040 --> 18:20.040
Yeah.

18:20.040 --> 18:21.040
So he has to keep them.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.040
That's fine because you can float quarks.

18:23.040 --> 18:29.040
Sorry to interrupt, but while we're at a stopping point, because Rachel has long since pressed pause on the recording.

18:29.040 --> 18:31.040
Bradley, are you here?

18:31.040 --> 18:33.040
Make a noise.

18:33.040 --> 18:34.040
Cool.

18:34.040 --> 18:38.040
I totally have your debit card.

18:38.040 --> 18:39.040
Okay, wait.

18:39.040 --> 18:41.040
And you'll have to fight him.

18:41.040 --> 18:42.040
Hey, Bradley.

18:42.040 --> 18:43.040
Wait, wait, stop.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.040
Everyone be quiet.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.040
Everyone be quiet.

18:45.040 --> 18:50.040
Bradley, can you woo again with the knowledge that has been important to you, please?

18:50.040 --> 18:52.040
That's good.

18:52.040 --> 18:53.040
That's right.

18:53.040 --> 19:00.040
Bradley, just for future reference, if you're in an event like this and someone asks you to make a noise, you have no clue what's about to come.

19:00.040 --> 19:02.040
Timber is like, yes.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.040
Yeah.

19:03.040 --> 19:05.040
Because it could be like your card just flipped over.

19:05.040 --> 19:07.040
Let's also be clear how I phrased that.

19:07.040 --> 19:09.040
I didn't say I need to give you your debit card.

19:09.040 --> 19:11.040
I said, I totally have your debit card.

19:11.040 --> 19:12.040
He's bragging, if anything.

19:12.040 --> 19:15.040
I mean, that sounds like the beginning of Blackmail to me.

19:15.040 --> 19:19.040
Seriously though, just come like down to the stage once the show's done and show me some ID.

19:19.040 --> 19:23.040
With your head hung in shame.

19:23.040 --> 19:30.040
Bradley, did you think Paul was going to be like, hey, good news, you won $1,000?

19:30.040 --> 19:32.040
The adoption papers came through.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.040
You're my son.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.040
You're my son now.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.040
I've adopted you.

19:35.040 --> 19:37.040
Paul and Stormin Bradley.

19:37.040 --> 19:39.040
So a lot of people sent this one in.

19:39.040 --> 19:44.040
And I feel especially equipped to try and answer this given the photography convention that I've kind of attended.

19:44.040 --> 19:46.040
Yeah.

19:46.040 --> 19:48.040
So thank you, everybody who sent it in.

19:48.040 --> 19:50.040
It was co-authored.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.040
Oh, it has a name on it.

19:51.040 --> 19:52.040
Tracy Halverson.

19:52.040 --> 19:53.040
Are you here?

19:53.040 --> 19:55.040
Probably not.

19:55.040 --> 19:57.040
Who is a modeling agent.

19:57.040 --> 20:04.040
Okay, so this is going to be a lot of good info because it is how to be a foot model.

20:04.040 --> 20:06.040
Are you all going to be fucking weird about this whole thing?

20:06.040 --> 20:09.040
Because I can stop right now.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.040
We are grown-ups.

20:11.040 --> 20:13.040
They're just feet, people.

20:13.040 --> 20:14.040
Foot modeling.

20:14.040 --> 20:16.040
The type of parts modeling.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.040
An important part of fashion modeling.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.040
It's not parts modeling.

20:19.040 --> 20:20.040
That's not what you said.

20:20.040 --> 20:21.040
A type of parts modeling.

20:21.040 --> 20:22.040
Oh, that can't be it.

20:22.040 --> 20:23.040
Remodel the parts.

20:23.040 --> 20:25.040
Okay, this is the whole sentence.

20:25.040 --> 20:26.040
Foot modeling.

20:26.040 --> 20:27.040
A type of parts modeling.

20:27.040 --> 20:28.040
An important part of fashion modeling.

20:28.040 --> 20:31.040
Period.

20:31.040 --> 20:35.040
Many large designer shoe companies require foot models for their advertisements.

20:35.040 --> 20:36.040
If you have...

20:36.040 --> 20:40.040
One more time, please.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.040
If you have...

20:41.040 --> 20:46.040
That was Urchin.

20:46.040 --> 20:48.040
One more time, please.

20:48.040 --> 20:53.040
If you have lovely feet.

20:53.040 --> 20:54.040
Okay.

20:54.040 --> 20:55.040
Now, I don't want to yuck anyone's.

20:55.040 --> 20:56.040
Young people do have lovely feet.

20:56.040 --> 20:57.040
Sure.

20:57.040 --> 21:00.040
Name them.

21:00.040 --> 21:05.040
I am submitting a formal request to the government that you do not name them.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.040
It's been denied.

21:06.040 --> 21:07.040
I'm sorry.

21:07.040 --> 21:08.040
The postmaster general said no.

21:08.040 --> 21:10.040
He needs to hear this too.

21:10.040 --> 21:12.040
If you have lovely feet, you might...

21:12.040 --> 21:13.040
This sounds like...

21:13.040 --> 21:14.040
I'll get through this sentence.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.040
I swear to God.

21:15.040 --> 21:20.040
But it does sound like the start or maybe the end of a lawyer commercial that's like,

21:20.040 --> 21:24.040
if you have lovely feet, you may be entitled to...

21:24.040 --> 21:27.040
If you have either mesothelioma or lovely feet.

21:27.040 --> 21:28.040
Or lovely feet.

21:28.040 --> 21:29.040
Or both.

21:29.040 --> 21:31.040
They're not mutually exclusive.

21:31.040 --> 21:34.040
My mesothelioma gave me lovely feet.

21:34.040 --> 21:39.040
I wouldn't change a thing.

21:39.040 --> 21:40.040
Worth it.

21:40.040 --> 21:45.040
If you have lovely feet.

21:45.040 --> 21:48.040
If you have lovely feet.

21:48.040 --> 21:55.040
And mesothelioma.

21:55.040 --> 21:58.040
If you have lovely feet.

21:58.040 --> 21:59.040
Come on, man.

21:59.040 --> 22:00.040
You can do it.

22:00.040 --> 22:02.040
Everyone believe hard enough.

22:02.040 --> 22:04.040
I just got to fucking ramp it.

22:04.040 --> 22:08.040
If you have lovely feet, you might be able to make extra money or even an entire career

22:08.040 --> 22:09.040
as a foot model.

22:09.040 --> 22:10.040
Here we go.

22:10.040 --> 22:15.040
Oh, there's a lot of cartoon feet happening on this page now.

22:15.040 --> 22:16.040
Any SpongeBob's?

22:16.040 --> 22:18.040
Yeah, a lot of good ones, SpongeBob's.

22:18.040 --> 22:23.040
Practice using your feet to articulate emotion.

22:23.040 --> 22:24.040
Huh.

22:24.040 --> 22:25.040
Huh.

22:25.040 --> 22:26.040
Sadder.

22:26.040 --> 22:30.040
Many of the most sought after feet models have more than just beautiful feet.

22:30.040 --> 22:32.040
I'm assuming they meant lovely feet.

22:32.040 --> 22:36.040
They know how to use their feet to evoke emotion during a photo or video shoot to help sell

22:36.040 --> 22:37.040
a product.

22:37.040 --> 22:45.040
Your feet may have to look like they've just been tickled or your, or your curled toes

22:45.040 --> 22:48.040
might need to convey excitement.

22:48.040 --> 22:51.040
Practice striking poses with your feet in the mirror and quickly changing between different

22:51.040 --> 22:54.040
foot positions.

22:54.040 --> 22:57.040
On the set of a photo shoot, you want to be able to immediately follow the instructions

22:57.040 --> 22:59.040
you're given about how your feet should look.

22:59.040 --> 23:01.040
Curl your toes in ecstasy.

23:01.040 --> 23:03.040
Holy shit.

23:03.040 --> 23:04.040
That was so fast.

23:04.040 --> 23:07.040
They're the one, smut.

23:07.040 --> 23:08.040
Create a portfolio.

23:08.040 --> 23:14.040
Smile with your foot, smut.

23:14.040 --> 23:16.040
No, that's smankeling.

23:16.040 --> 23:17.040
You're smankeling right now.

23:17.040 --> 23:18.040
No, that's smose.

23:18.040 --> 23:21.040
You're smiling with your toes, smut.

23:21.040 --> 23:23.040
You're smooching your boots right now.

23:23.040 --> 23:25.040
That's not right.

23:25.040 --> 23:31.040
Create a portfolio of your feet.

23:31.040 --> 23:35.040
This will help you to find modeling jobs and have pictures on hand when you need them.

23:35.040 --> 23:39.040
Someone in the audience is trying to cover the fact that they're taking hasty notes right

23:39.040 --> 23:40.040
now.

23:40.040 --> 23:41.040
Yeah, I got that.

23:41.040 --> 23:43.040
I got the portfolio of my feet.

23:43.040 --> 23:47.040
You can keep this portfolio organized online in a website or even on Instagram.

23:47.040 --> 23:49.040
Password protected, if you may.

23:49.040 --> 23:50.040
No.

23:50.040 --> 23:54.040
Include an about me page or a list of your work, history, and modeling.

23:54.040 --> 23:58.040
Make sure you have pictures from different angles and various styles of lighting with,

23:58.040 --> 24:02.040
I'm assuming, different emotions expressed by each individual foot.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.040
Don't confuse those.

24:03.040 --> 24:06.040
Man, I hate to see a sad foot with happy lighting, right?

24:06.040 --> 24:08.040
Because I'm like, what could possibly be happening here?

24:08.040 --> 24:10.040
Look at that lighting.

24:10.040 --> 24:11.040
Get it together, foot.

24:11.040 --> 24:12.040
This one's easy.

24:12.040 --> 24:14.040
Sign with a modeling agency in your area.

24:14.040 --> 24:15.040
Yeah.

24:15.040 --> 24:20.040
In my area, it's Skeffington's, weirdly enough.

24:20.040 --> 24:25.040
You can sign with multiple modeling agencies there, hot feet, to book more jobs when you

24:25.040 --> 24:26.040
are first beginning.

24:26.040 --> 24:30.040
Sometimes there are specific agencies for body part models, like foot models.

24:30.040 --> 24:31.040
Here's the deal.

24:31.040 --> 24:34.040
We only do middle toe and pinky toe.

24:34.040 --> 24:37.040
That's our department.

24:37.040 --> 24:40.040
Any other toes, you go down the street.

24:40.040 --> 24:42.040
Throw up the horns.

24:42.040 --> 24:43.040
No, not like that.

24:43.040 --> 24:44.040
No.

24:44.040 --> 24:45.040
The downtown horns.

24:45.040 --> 24:46.040
Oh, sorry.

24:46.040 --> 24:48.040
You're looking for happy toes?

24:48.040 --> 24:49.040
That's next door.

24:49.040 --> 24:50.040
That's next door.

24:50.040 --> 24:51.040
It's for children.

24:51.040 --> 24:52.040
We only rep adult models.

24:52.040 --> 24:54.040
Tasteful, discreet, adult foot models.

24:54.040 --> 24:57.040
Can you really sign with multiple modeling agencies at the same time?

24:57.040 --> 24:59.040
I don't think that is right.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.040
I don't think it's right.

25:00.040 --> 25:03.040
One gets the right foot, one gets the left foot.

25:03.040 --> 25:07.040
But what if any of us are competing shoots on the same day?

25:07.040 --> 25:09.040
This one's name is Jersey Dave.

25:09.040 --> 25:11.040
He's the bad boy of my feet.

25:11.040 --> 25:14.040
He does a lot of S&M and leather stuff.

25:14.040 --> 25:15.040
And over here, this is Daisy.

25:15.040 --> 25:19.040
She's the good foot.

25:19.040 --> 25:22.040
Sorry, I thought Jersey Dave was a sandwich shop.

25:22.040 --> 25:23.040
Jersey Mike's.

25:23.040 --> 25:24.040
It can be both.

25:24.040 --> 25:25.040
Okay.

25:25.040 --> 25:29.040
Why can't a foot open a sandwich store?

25:29.040 --> 25:30.040
And this is my foot.

25:30.040 --> 25:31.040
It's a sandwich.

25:31.040 --> 25:32.040
What?

25:32.040 --> 25:36.040
Consider moving to a city with a large advertisement market.

25:36.040 --> 25:39.040
It doesn't say or also with a lot of feet, folks.

25:39.040 --> 25:42.040
You'd love to think you could do it all from home.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.040
I get that with the Zoom and everything.

25:44.040 --> 25:47.040
But you really got to go where the money is, where the foot money is.

25:47.040 --> 25:50.040
How is the foot money not on the internet?

25:50.040 --> 25:53.040
How is the foot money not on the internet?

25:53.040 --> 25:54.040
A sentence?

25:54.040 --> 25:57.040
Well, I thought I actually would say, I'm not surprised that I said that in my life.

25:57.040 --> 26:00.040
You've definitely said, I think all of us have said that sentence out loud at some point

26:00.040 --> 26:03.040
with the exact tone of voice that you said it.

26:03.040 --> 26:08.040
This says, for example, Parts Models, located in New York, is one of the largest body parts

26:08.040 --> 26:09.040
modeling agencies in the country.

26:09.040 --> 26:10.040
So wait a second.

26:10.040 --> 26:15.040
Because I feel like that sentence needed a comma in it somewhere.

26:15.040 --> 26:19.040
We got the biggest feet here at Parts Models.

26:19.040 --> 26:23.040
The more you say it, the more it sounds like some Dexter-ass shit, right?

26:23.040 --> 26:25.040
Oh, we model body parts.

26:25.040 --> 26:28.040
You mean like on people, right?

26:28.040 --> 26:30.040
Yeah!

26:30.040 --> 26:33.040
Well, how much you got?

26:33.040 --> 26:36.040
This is where the article really betrays itself.

26:36.040 --> 26:38.040
Accept other types of modeling jobs.

26:38.040 --> 26:41.040
When you're beginning your modeling career, you may want to diversify the types of modeling

26:41.040 --> 26:44.040
positions to seek out your consistent work.

26:44.040 --> 26:49.040
The rest of my body is fucking gross, but my feet...

26:49.040 --> 26:51.040
Oh, my feet.

26:51.040 --> 26:56.040
What's great is in the ad sidebar right next to that was a picture of Buzz Lightyear.

26:56.040 --> 26:58.040
Just kidding, they're very brown.

26:58.040 --> 27:00.040
What are you talking about?

27:00.040 --> 27:02.040
What's going on over on this article?

27:02.040 --> 27:04.040
Mmm.

27:04.040 --> 27:07.040
Determine what type of foot model you want to be.

27:07.040 --> 27:10.040
In all sectors of modeling, you can be either a fashion model or a fit model.

27:10.040 --> 27:13.040
A fit model works directly with designers to make sure that the shoes fit to size and look good.

27:13.040 --> 27:17.040
Fashion models work on advertisements and photo spreads with companies and designers.

27:17.040 --> 27:19.040
That's me.

27:19.040 --> 27:21.040
Oh, no, I pivoted into learning.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.040
Sorry, Justin.

27:23.040 --> 27:25.040
Okay, here, we'll move on to caring for your feet.

27:25.040 --> 27:27.040
Exfoliate that shit.

27:27.040 --> 27:29.040
Yes!

27:29.040 --> 27:31.040
Oh, man, actually just say...

27:31.040 --> 27:33.040
Actually just moisturize that shit.

27:33.040 --> 27:35.040
I'm going to speed through these.

27:35.040 --> 27:37.040
Exercise that shit.

27:37.040 --> 27:39.040
Rub your feet or have them massaged regularly to keep the circulation good.

27:39.040 --> 27:41.040
You should be doing that anyway.

27:41.040 --> 27:43.040
You know, we're comfortable in protective shoes.

27:43.040 --> 27:45.040
As a foot model, your feet are your source of income.

27:45.040 --> 27:51.040
In your daily, everyday life, you want to do everything you can to keep them free of strain or marks?

27:51.040 --> 27:53.040
Yeah, I guess if you kick a rock the wrong way.

27:53.040 --> 27:59.040
But I like to think if you're a foot model, you wouldn't be taking chances like that with a devil-maker attitude.

27:59.040 --> 28:01.040
If you're the bad boy of foot modeling, like me...

28:01.040 --> 28:03.040
Yes!

28:03.040 --> 28:07.040
I want to buy shoes from a foot model where the feet have, like, been through some shit.

28:07.040 --> 28:09.040
Yeah, their character.

28:09.040 --> 28:13.040
They're like cowboy feet that are all fucked up.

28:13.040 --> 28:15.040
Yeah!

28:15.040 --> 28:17.040
Like a horse kicked this foot.

28:17.040 --> 28:19.040
Yeah!

28:19.040 --> 28:21.040
The open range.

28:21.040 --> 28:23.040
A real American foot.

28:23.040 --> 28:25.040
Yeah.

28:25.040 --> 28:29.040
Lost a toe gangrene in the Adidara by my shoes.

28:29.040 --> 28:33.040
The exact ones I was wearing at the time.

28:33.040 --> 28:37.040
Anyway, this segment got a lot grosser and judgier than I thought it would.

28:37.040 --> 28:41.040
And so I'd like to apologize on both accounts.

28:41.040 --> 28:45.040
When my boyfriend and I moved into our current rental, the toilet seats were super cheap.

28:45.040 --> 28:49.040
Plastic seats that allowed us to feel unsupported while on the throne.

28:49.040 --> 28:53.040
What are toilet seats traditionally made out of?

28:53.040 --> 28:55.040
Chrome.

28:55.040 --> 28:59.040
You know, it's just you can have a nice plastic.

28:59.040 --> 29:01.040
You know, a nice, thick, durable plastic.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.040
Or like a marble.

29:03.040 --> 29:05.040
I don't think that.

29:05.040 --> 29:09.040
Just like a circular hibachi table.

29:09.040 --> 29:11.040
Mother of pearl inlay.

29:11.040 --> 29:13.040
Right.

29:13.040 --> 29:17.040
So we purchased two new toilet seats that were a few steps up in quality.

29:17.040 --> 29:19.040
About $25 each.

29:19.040 --> 29:21.040
Ooh la la.

29:21.040 --> 29:23.040
I asked the landlord if she wanted the original seats back.

29:23.040 --> 29:25.040
We have no storage space.

29:25.040 --> 29:27.040
And she said no.

29:27.040 --> 29:29.040
Flash forward to now.

29:29.040 --> 29:31.040
Wait, just real quick.

29:31.040 --> 29:33.040
What else was the landlord?

29:33.040 --> 29:35.040
Do you want to hold on to these?

29:35.040 --> 29:37.040
Yeah, do you need these?

29:37.040 --> 29:39.040
That someone has used.

29:39.040 --> 29:41.040
Flash forward to now.

29:41.040 --> 29:43.040
We are moving in a few months to be closer to work.

29:43.040 --> 29:45.040
My question is this.

29:45.040 --> 29:51.040
Do we have to leave our toilet seats since we trashed the original crappy ha ha seats?

29:51.040 --> 29:53.040
Back in there?

29:53.040 --> 29:55.040
Yeah.

29:55.040 --> 29:57.040
Pause for laughs.

29:57.040 --> 29:59.040
Continue to pause.

29:59.040 --> 30:03.040
What about the toilets since we paid for them and leave the rental seatless?

30:03.040 --> 30:05.040
That's from toilet seat stress in St. Louis.

30:05.040 --> 30:07.040
Scream like you're being tortured?

30:07.040 --> 30:09.040
Oh.

30:09.040 --> 30:15.040
Someone doesn't want friends coming over to use your incredible toilet seats.

30:15.040 --> 30:17.040
I respect it.

30:17.040 --> 30:19.040
I do.

30:19.040 --> 30:21.040
My problem with taking the toilet seats.

30:21.040 --> 30:23.040
Just one.

30:23.040 --> 30:25.040
Main problem with taking the toilet seats.

30:25.040 --> 30:33.040
Is that it presupposes a reality in which you arrive at your new domicile and it has everything your heart could desire.

30:33.040 --> 30:35.040
Except toilet seats.

30:35.040 --> 30:41.040
What are you going to do with your new spare toilet seats?

30:41.040 --> 30:43.040
I think Travis and I can-

30:43.040 --> 30:45.040
Pay it back.

30:45.040 --> 30:47.040
Take those old toilet seats from the new place.

30:47.040 --> 30:51.040
Make them the new toilet seats of the old place.

30:51.040 --> 30:53.040
Wait.

30:53.040 --> 30:55.040
Stop.

30:55.040 --> 30:57.040
Absolutely cheer.

30:57.040 --> 30:59.040
Wait.

30:59.040 --> 31:05.040
Are you saying in your mind's eye that the new toilet seats at the new place are worse than the purchase?

31:05.040 --> 31:07.040
Because $25 is like good.

31:07.040 --> 31:09.040
I don't know toilet seat prices.

31:09.040 --> 31:11.040
Hey, hold on.

31:11.040 --> 31:17.040
Can you do this bit standing up so everybody can see the tuxedo you're wearing so you can talk about fucking toilet seat quality?

31:17.040 --> 31:19.040
And I want everyone-

31:19.040 --> 31:21.040
Hold on.

31:21.040 --> 31:27.040
I want everyone to just sort of think about the sort of putrid-

31:27.040 --> 31:29.040
Your fly is down too by the way.

31:29.040 --> 31:31.040
It's extremely down.

31:31.040 --> 31:33.040
No, fix that.

31:33.040 --> 31:47.040
I want everyone to just sort of think about the rotting corpse of late stage capitalism as Justin speaks about the $25 toilet seat and how they are unsatisfactory.

31:47.040 --> 31:51.040
Have you heard about this bidets?

31:51.040 --> 31:53.040
Now they got bidets.

31:53.040 --> 31:55.040
Thanks for giving it a drink.

31:55.040 --> 31:57.040
I'm just trying to poop over here.

31:57.040 --> 31:59.040
It's pretty good.

31:59.040 --> 32:01.040
This is not the character I thought it was going to be.

32:01.040 --> 32:09.040
Justin, say something about bidets and confused and see if you win them back.

32:09.040 --> 32:17.040
Um, imagine-

32:17.040 --> 32:19.040
Where is anybody even buying these things?

32:19.040 --> 32:21.040
Nice.

32:21.040 --> 32:23.040
Good start.

32:23.040 --> 32:25.040
Where is any-

32:25.040 --> 32:27.040
It's so hot. Do you feel like it's so hot?

32:27.040 --> 32:31.040
Where is anybody even buying these?

32:31.040 --> 32:33.040
Talk about toilet seats?

32:33.040 --> 32:35.040
Probably Home Depot or Lowe's.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.040
Home Depot or Lowe's, one of the two.

32:37.040 --> 32:41.040
Where is- I wanted to leave the new-

32:41.040 --> 32:43.040
The throne.

32:43.040 --> 32:45.040
Some throne this is.

32:45.040 --> 32:47.040
I think he's crying.

32:47.040 --> 32:49.040
I think he is too.

32:49.040 --> 32:51.040
Some-

32:51.040 --> 32:53.040
Airplane food, huh?

32:53.040 --> 32:55.040
Yeah, that's right.

32:55.040 --> 32:57.040
Bring it home.

32:57.040 --> 32:59.040
That's my time. Thanks.

32:59.040 --> 33:09.040
We really didn't give you much to work with when we sent you out there and I am sorry for that.

33:09.040 --> 33:11.040
Come on. I'll be fine.

33:11.040 --> 33:13.040
I just need a little red wine. I'll be fine.

33:13.040 --> 33:25.040
There is no reality in which you can leave the next tenants of this place you have lived in for a while now zero toilet seats.

33:25.040 --> 33:37.040
It runs the risk of starting a change reaction in which when you go to check out a new house or a new apartment people having to with a straight face ask the question, and do the toilet seats come with it?

33:37.040 --> 33:39.040
Do the toilet seats commute?

33:39.040 --> 33:41.040
Are they included?

33:41.040 --> 33:43.040
I think when you-

33:43.040 --> 33:45.040
This is how they get you. Do we have to pay extra for the toilet seats?

33:45.040 --> 33:47.040
I've been around the block.

33:47.040 --> 33:55.040
I think once you make a capital improvement to a rental property you have to accept that as that sunk cost.

33:55.040 --> 33:57.040
That money is gone.

33:57.040 --> 33:59.040
It's like national parks rules.

33:59.040 --> 34:01.040
Leave it better than you found it.

34:01.040 --> 34:03.040
Don't take the toilet seats.

34:03.040 --> 34:05.040
Don't take the toilet seats. You're improving it.

34:05.040 --> 34:11.040
If you had repainted you wouldn't lick the walls clean before you left.

34:11.040 --> 34:15.040
What are you talking about?

34:15.040 --> 34:19.040
I paid for it. I'm going to eat every drop.

34:19.040 --> 34:21.040
It's my legal right.

34:21.040 --> 34:23.040
Is that what Willy Wonka did when he had to vacate the factory?

34:23.040 --> 34:25.040
Hey everybody lick the walls.

34:25.040 --> 34:27.040
This just tastes like paint.

34:27.040 --> 34:29.040
Yeah but keep going please.

34:29.040 --> 34:31.040
That's what he didn't tell Charlie. It's all yours Charlie. All of this.

34:31.040 --> 34:33.040
I'm going to take the fucking toilet seats.

34:33.040 --> 34:37.040
You think I'm just going to leave you the big room where everything is made out of candy?

34:37.040 --> 34:39.040
Do you think that was free Charlie?

34:39.040 --> 34:41.040
I'm taking the Oompa Loompas.

34:41.040 --> 34:43.040
I hope you know how to make candy.

34:43.040 --> 34:45.040
And the boat's a lease.

34:45.040 --> 34:47.040
So...

34:47.040 --> 34:49.040
So...

34:49.040 --> 34:51.040
It's better with you.

34:51.040 --> 34:53.040
It's better with you.

34:53.040 --> 34:55.040
It's better with you.

34:55.040 --> 34:57.040
Hi everybody.

34:57.040 --> 35:01.040
It's me your middle-ist and dare I say Travis brother.

35:01.040 --> 35:03.040
Travis McElroy.

35:03.040 --> 35:09.040
I'm here to tell you a little bit about I was going to say sponsors but maybe even friends this week.

35:09.040 --> 35:13.040
First Bombas. Bombas' mission is simple.

35:13.040 --> 35:19.040
Make the most comfortable clothes ever and match every item sold with an equal item donated.

35:19.040 --> 35:21.040
So when you buy Bombas you're also given to someone in need.

35:21.040 --> 35:27.040
Bombas designs their socks, shirts, and underwears to be the clothes you can't wait to put on every day.

35:27.040 --> 35:31.040
Everything they make is soft, seamless, tagless, and has a cozy feel.

35:31.040 --> 35:33.040
I very much vouch for that.

35:33.040 --> 35:37.040
I am wearing Bombas socks and underpants as we speak.

35:37.040 --> 35:39.040
It's wonderful.

35:39.040 --> 35:45.040
Bombas no-show socks are designed for comfort while being specially engineered to never fall down.

35:45.040 --> 35:49.040
So let your ankles be free to soak up the sunlight my friends.

35:49.040 --> 35:55.040

36:01.040 --> 36:03.040
Bombas dot com slash my brother.

36:03.040 --> 36:05.040
And now we'll talk about Stitch Fix.

36:05.040 --> 36:07.040
Because what's that?

36:07.040 --> 36:11.040
I'm wearing over my Bombas underpants while it's my Stitch Fix clothes.

36:11.040 --> 36:15.040
Of course, whatever your style, now more than ever is the time to rock it.

36:15.040 --> 36:17.040
That is absolutely true.

36:17.040 --> 36:19.040
No truer words.

36:19.040 --> 36:21.040
But maybe you can use just a little nudge to find some new looks.

36:21.040 --> 36:23.040
That's where Stitch Fix can help you out.

36:23.040 --> 36:31.040
I just got sent a Stitch Fix that contained a combination of clothes which I like to think of as a dad at beach wedding.

36:31.040 --> 36:33.040
But like a cool dad, right?

36:33.040 --> 36:37.040
Like a dad who's watched every James Bond movie and actually took some style tips away from it.

36:37.040 --> 36:39.040
That kind of thing, right?

36:39.040 --> 36:41.040
So first, here's how Stitch Fix works.

36:41.040 --> 36:44.040
Take a few minutes to set up your Stitch Fix style profile.

36:44.040 --> 36:50.040
Answer a few questions about what you like to wear, what you don't, and how open you are to trying new styles.

36:50.040 --> 36:55.040
Then Stitch Fix's expert stylist will go to work finding items exclusively for you.

36:55.040 --> 37:00.040
Every piece is hand-picked for you and is unique to your style, size, and in your budget.

37:00.040 --> 37:03.040
And they'll send you five pieces to try on at home.

37:03.040 --> 37:04.040
You only keep what you love.

37:04.040 --> 37:06.040
You send back what you don't.

37:06.040 --> 37:08.040

37:22.040 --> 37:24.040
And finally, Babble.

37:24.040 --> 37:25.040
Right?

37:25.040 --> 37:26.040
What's that?

37:26.040 --> 37:29.040
I'm wearing Barbra's underpants, Stitch Fix pants, and what's that in my mouth?

37:29.040 --> 37:30.040
It's Babble words.

37:30.040 --> 37:31.040
There it is.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.040
Yeah.

37:32.040 --> 37:33.040
Right?

37:33.040 --> 37:38.040
I have a dream of someday when the kids are older, right, being able to go to France and

37:38.040 --> 37:45.040
at the very least talk to people and not have them think that I am just an absolute, you

37:45.040 --> 37:46.040
know, baby.

37:46.040 --> 37:50.040
And so I've been working with Babble to try to learn some French.

37:50.040 --> 37:51.040
And you know what?

37:51.040 --> 37:52.040
It's fun.

37:52.040 --> 37:53.040
It's easy.

37:53.040 --> 37:58.040
And I actually think for once in my life I'm actually retaining some of the language I'm

37:58.040 --> 37:59.040
learning.

37:59.040 --> 38:00.040
Right?

38:00.040 --> 38:03.040
So if you have any, you know, travel plans or maybe you just want to pick up a new language,

38:03.040 --> 38:09.040
whatever it is, Babble is the language learning app that sold more than 10 million subscriptions.

With Babble, you only need 10 minutes to complete a lesson so you can start having real life

38:13.040 --> 38:17.040
conversations in a new language in as little as three weeks.

38:17.040 --> 38:22.040
Other language learning apps use AI for their lesson plans, but Babble lessons were created

38:22.040 --> 38:24.040
by over 150 language experts.

38:24.040 --> 38:28.040

I also want to make sure before we get back to the show, you know about our upcoming tours.

38:47.040 --> 38:51.040
Next week, we're going to be in Salt Lake City, Portland, San Diego for my brother,

38:51.040 --> 38:53.040

38:53.040 --> 38:57.040
Now, I got to warn you that Portland show and the San Diego, my brother, my brother,

39:50.040 --> 39:52.040
And now, back to the show.

39:54.040 --> 39:56.040
Hi, I'm Janet Varney.

39:56.040 --> 40:00.040
And just like you, I survived high school.

40:00.040 --> 40:01.040
And we're not alone.

40:01.040 --> 40:07.040
On my podcast, The JV Club, I invite some of my friends to share the highs and lows

40:07.040 --> 40:10.040
of their teen years, like moments with Aisha Tyler.

40:10.040 --> 40:13.040
But when you're a kid, the stakes are just pretty low.

40:13.040 --> 40:16.040
Go to school, try not to get in trouble, get laid.

40:16.040 --> 40:17.040
Jamila Jamil.

40:17.040 --> 40:23.040
I watched television probably every waking hour during that time when I was shitfaced on medicine.

40:23.040 --> 40:24.040
And Dave Holmes.

40:24.040 --> 40:26.040
We talked and talked, and then everybody left.

40:26.040 --> 40:27.040
It was just us two, and I was like, I love you.

40:27.040 --> 40:32.040
Learn how you too can be a functioning adult after the drama and heartbreak of high school.

40:32.040 --> 40:34.040
Every week on The JV Club with Janet Varney.

40:34.040 --> 40:36.040
Find it on Maximum Fun.

40:36.040 --> 40:38.040
Or wherever you get your podcasts.

40:38.040 --> 40:40.040
This is a judgment-free show.

40:40.040 --> 40:47.040
Hi, I'm Biz, host of One Bad Mother.

40:47.040 --> 40:50.040
Whether you're a parent or just know kids exist in the world,

40:50.040 --> 40:54.040
join us each week as we honestly share what it's like to be a parent.

40:54.040 --> 40:59.040
I signed my stepson up for a camp that is actually in another state.

40:59.040 --> 41:03.040
I feel really stupid, and I don't think we're going to get the money back.

41:03.040 --> 41:06.040
And then he found out that the car manual is a book about cars.

41:06.040 --> 41:08.040
So now he's reading our car manual.

41:08.040 --> 41:13.040
We are excited.

41:13.040 --> 41:16.040
So join us each week as we judge less, laugh more,

41:16.040 --> 41:19.040
and remind you that you are doing a great job.

41:19.040 --> 41:22.040
Download One Bad Mother on MaximumFun.org.

41:22.040 --> 41:39.040
And yes, there will be swears.

41:39.040 --> 41:54.040
And then a different song.

41:54.040 --> 41:56.040
I want to munch.

41:56.040 --> 42:03.040
I want to munch.

42:03.040 --> 42:04.040
Welcome to Munch Squad.

42:04.040 --> 42:08.040
It is a podcast within a podcast.

42:08.040 --> 42:12.040
We're profiling the latest and greatest in brand eating.

42:12.040 --> 42:14.040
And we got a lot of excitement.

42:14.040 --> 42:21.040
I don't know if you guys looked at the calendar, but it's 420, baby.

42:21.040 --> 42:22.040
It's 420.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.040
And I wanted to take a moment with you.

42:24.040 --> 42:25.040
Wait, sorry.

42:25.040 --> 42:28.040
What does 420 have to do with anything?

42:28.040 --> 42:29.040
It's 420.

42:29.040 --> 42:30.040
Yeah.

42:30.040 --> 42:32.040
And I wanted to take a moment with you to tell you about all the great

42:32.040 --> 42:38.040
specials that are happening now in Earth about weed.

42:38.040 --> 42:39.040
Oh.

42:39.040 --> 42:40.040
Yeah, because it's weed day.

42:40.040 --> 42:47.040
Doghouse rolled out stony baloney items in honor of 420.

42:47.040 --> 42:49.040
I swear to God, when you started this bit, I was like,

42:49.040 --> 42:51.040
none of these are going to get me.

42:51.040 --> 42:54.040
And the first one out the gate.

42:54.040 --> 42:56.040
Stony baloney.

42:56.040 --> 42:58.040
Stony baloney items.

42:58.040 --> 43:00.040
They're coming out for 420.

43:00.040 --> 43:08.040
In honor of satisfy your munchies, the absolute worst way with

43:08.040 --> 43:10.040
Doghouse's new stony baloney.

43:10.040 --> 43:11.040
Don't look.

43:11.040 --> 43:12.040
Oh, it's worse.

43:12.040 --> 43:13.040
W-U-R-S-T.

43:13.040 --> 43:15.040
I thought there was like, this shit's terrible.

43:15.040 --> 43:16.040
This shit sucks.

43:16.040 --> 43:17.040
Our joke sucks.

43:17.040 --> 43:18.040
We suck.

43:18.040 --> 43:19.040
Please help us.

43:19.040 --> 43:23.040
In honor of 420, the award-winning gourmet hot dog sausage and burger

43:23.040 --> 43:28.040
concept, just say restaurant, is launching two dope menu items.

43:28.040 --> 43:30.040
I get it.

43:30.040 --> 43:34.040
It'll be available through, wait for it, May 31st.

43:34.040 --> 43:35.040
Yeah, bro.

43:35.040 --> 43:38.040
How about as a strength of your convictions?

43:38.040 --> 43:41.040
That's cocaine day, bro.

43:41.040 --> 43:45.040
These one-of-a-kind creations will turn any case of dry mouth into a

43:45.040 --> 43:47.040
mouthwatering craven.

43:47.040 --> 43:49.040
It doesn't matter what's on.

43:49.040 --> 43:53.040
There is a stony baloney breakfast burrito, which is three, count them,

43:53.040 --> 44:00.040
three sunny side up eggs with a beef patty, beef dog, chili, white American

44:00.040 --> 44:05.040
cheese, cheese sauce, crispy tater tots, onion and spicy mayo in a flour

44:05.040 --> 44:06.040
tortilla.

44:06.040 --> 44:08.040
Don't, ugh, if you're not high, friends.

44:08.040 --> 44:14.040
Does it cost $23?

44:14.040 --> 44:17.040
And does it come with baloney in it?

44:17.040 --> 44:20.040
In addition to the stony baloney menu items, Doghouse is offering its

44:20.040 --> 44:26.040
2022 Mixologist collaboration cocktails.

44:26.040 --> 44:30.040
The best part, for each purchase of the featured cocktails, Doghouse will

44:30.040 --> 44:34.040
donate $1 to its national charity partner, No Kid Hungry.

44:34.040 --> 44:39.040
A strange addition to this particular press release.

44:39.040 --> 44:42.040
Listen, it's not all fun and games.

44:42.040 --> 44:47.040
At Doghouse, we take every opportunity we can to craft unique creations

44:47.040 --> 44:51.040
and 420 munchies were a great inspiration.

44:51.040 --> 44:52.040
Says cool dude.

44:52.040 --> 44:55.040
Says your dad.

44:55.040 --> 44:58.040
Says your dad, Chef Adam Gertler.

44:58.040 --> 45:01.040
We're offering these through May to make sure all our guests get a chance

45:01.040 --> 45:03.040
to try them.

45:03.040 --> 45:06.040
We look forward to hearing what everyone thinks about the items, all

45:06.040 --> 45:08.040
while giving back to a great cause.

45:08.040 --> 45:10.040
Where's the strength of your convictions?

45:10.040 --> 45:14.040
If you're doing one about weed, be more like Chiba Hub, which is a

45:14.040 --> 45:17.040
restaurant about weed that doesn't actually sell weed.

45:17.040 --> 45:18.040
It's so important.

45:18.040 --> 45:20.040
It's weed themed.

45:20.040 --> 45:23.040
Chiba Hut toasted subs.

45:23.040 --> 45:27.040
Chiba Hut is offering plenty of deals to patrons to celebrate weed

45:27.040 --> 45:29.040
enthusiasts' favorite day of the year.

45:29.040 --> 45:31.040
Well, they just said it.

45:31.040 --> 45:34.040
They're offering, yes, Chiba has the strength of its convictions.

45:34.040 --> 45:35.040
That's what I'm saying.

45:35.040 --> 45:36.040
They don't do a wink and a nod.

45:36.040 --> 45:37.040
They're like, you like weed?

45:37.040 --> 45:38.040
We like making money.

45:38.040 --> 45:40.040
Here we go.

45:40.040 --> 45:48.040
They're offering $4.20 food and drink specials, giving out grinders

45:48.040 --> 45:50.040
and over a thousand rad prizes.

45:50.040 --> 45:52.040
Rad prizes, you say?

45:52.040 --> 45:54.040
Rad prizes, like free food for a year.

45:54.040 --> 45:55.040
Tubular.

45:55.040 --> 46:01.040
And a dream Colorado vacation, dude.

46:01.040 --> 46:05.040
It's all part of their 420 promotion with top shelf deals that go on for

46:05.040 --> 46:07.040
the entire month of April.

46:07.040 --> 46:16.040
The food special offers 420 nugs served on a special edition 2022 frisbees.

46:16.040 --> 46:25.040
You guys like this too, right?

46:25.040 --> 46:29.040
They had to be like, hey, do we have any sort of just weed stuff lying

46:29.040 --> 46:30.040
around?

46:30.040 --> 46:33.040
Well, we got a bunch of frisbees from that summer promotion that failed

46:33.040 --> 46:34.040
back in 2003.

46:34.040 --> 46:35.040
Yeah.

46:35.040 --> 46:36.040
Get those.

46:36.040 --> 46:38.040
Waystoys love flinging that fruit.

46:38.040 --> 46:42.040
They can wash down their meal with either a delicious Pabst blue ribbon

46:42.040 --> 46:45.040
draft pour and a side shot of fireball.

46:45.040 --> 46:47.040
That's your day.

46:47.040 --> 46:48.040
That's your day.

46:48.040 --> 46:55.040
A side shot of fireball or two PBRs for the fitting price of 420 as well.

46:55.040 --> 46:59.040
This is another example of how we aren't your basic sub shop.

46:59.040 --> 47:01.040
We have awesome bars within our huts.

47:01.040 --> 47:04.040
We're not a cover for the government.

47:04.040 --> 47:07.040
We've teamed up.

47:07.040 --> 47:11.040
We've teamed up with some great partners this year, like Pabst and

47:11.040 --> 47:12.040
fireball.

47:12.040 --> 47:14.040
No, get out.

47:14.040 --> 47:18.040
In my experience, those two working together rarely leads to a satisfactory

47:18.040 --> 47:20.040
outcome.

47:20.040 --> 47:26.040
To bring our 21 plus crowd some insane drink specials and sweepstakes.

47:26.040 --> 47:28.040
And that's from Mel Bannister.

47:28.040 --> 47:29.040
I don't know if you all know.

47:29.040 --> 47:30.040
Mel, are you here?

47:30.040 --> 47:31.040
Mel.

47:31.040 --> 47:32.040
That's not all.

47:32.040 --> 47:37.040
Each location is offering a special interactive grinder.

47:37.040 --> 47:38.040
What?

47:38.040 --> 47:39.040
What?

47:39.040 --> 47:42.040
Each location is offering a special interactive grinder.

47:42.040 --> 47:48.040
I mean, I interact with most sandwiches that I get my hands on.

47:48.040 --> 47:53.040
It's an interactive grinder to the first hundred people to stop by on April 20th,

47:53.040 --> 48:01.040
which has a QR code that is scannable until July the 10th.

48:01.040 --> 48:02.040
To do what?

48:02.040 --> 48:04.040
To start an ARG?

48:04.040 --> 48:05.040
That can't be right.

48:05.040 --> 48:06.040
Is it?

48:06.040 --> 48:07.040
Is it?

48:07.040 --> 48:08.040
Hey, honey.

48:08.040 --> 48:11.040
What are you going to throw in this wrapper room, Jeebus?

48:11.040 --> 48:13.040
Okay, so that over two months.

48:13.040 --> 48:14.040
I'm getting around to it.

48:14.040 --> 48:15.040
I'm getting around.

48:15.040 --> 48:19.040
I'm going to scan that QR code here in the next three months.

48:19.040 --> 48:21.040
I was envisioning.

48:21.040 --> 48:22.040
I was envisioning.

48:22.040 --> 48:23.040
I didn't know it was on the wrapper.

48:23.040 --> 48:24.040
Both are wild.

48:24.040 --> 48:28.040
I thought I was envisioning somebody like a sandwich artist having to like

48:28.040 --> 48:32.040
draw out the QR code with mustard on each.

48:32.040 --> 48:34.040
This means something.

48:34.040 --> 48:39.040
The grand prize is a vacation to Colorado for one person and a guest

48:39.040 --> 48:41.040
with flights and activities like whitewater rafting,

48:41.040 --> 48:44.040
horseback riding at the Garden of the Gods,

48:44.040 --> 48:47.040
and a cannabis tour included.

48:47.040 --> 48:52.040
Customers will also be getting hooked up with Willie's Reserve rolling papers.

48:52.040 --> 48:55.040
Every store will have its own special events going on,

48:55.040 --> 48:57.040
so be sure to stay plugged into your local Chibas.

48:57.040 --> 49:02.040
You can't just sneak in that you're distributing paraphernalia in there.

49:02.040 --> 49:04.040
Like, yeah, what's up waste-oids?

49:04.040 --> 49:07.040
Do you want to come skateboard with me, a cool adult?

49:07.040 --> 49:11.040
Anyway, we will give you a big fucking bong and like half an ounce.

49:11.040 --> 49:12.040
Is that a lot?

49:12.040 --> 49:13.040
I don't know.

49:13.040 --> 49:16.040
Do you think you have to take the rolling papers?

49:16.040 --> 49:18.040
I just wanted a sandwich, dude.

49:18.040 --> 49:19.040
I'm on my lunch break.

49:19.040 --> 49:20.040
I'm on my lunch break.

49:20.040 --> 49:21.040
Oh, come on, man.

49:21.040 --> 49:22.040
Scan the QR code.

49:22.040 --> 49:23.040
No.

49:23.040 --> 49:24.040
No.

49:24.040 --> 49:26.040
Give me until you have until July.

49:26.040 --> 49:28.040
I'm throwing this away now.

49:28.040 --> 49:29.040
Wait.

49:29.040 --> 49:33.040
So you want me to scan something and then register all my information into it

49:33.040 --> 49:36.040
as you hand me these rolling papers?

49:36.040 --> 49:37.040
Totally cool.

49:37.040 --> 49:42.040
Just put your home address and previous criminal record, dude.

49:42.040 --> 49:44.040
Got any ties?

49:44.040 --> 49:46.040
Any shady groups you should know about?

49:46.040 --> 49:50.040
Go ahead and put your thumb right on the screen, dog.

49:50.040 --> 49:58.040
Del Taco's rolling out new iteration of 20 under $2 value menu and new poppers drinks.

49:58.040 --> 50:03.040
As inflation continues to skyrocket, prices on everything from gas...

50:03.040 --> 50:04.040
Who cares?

50:04.040 --> 50:06.040
Tell me about the weed stuff.

50:06.040 --> 50:09.040
I mean, Del Taco doesn't really need to say,

50:09.040 --> 50:12.040
hey, weed friends, come and get it if you're high.

50:12.040 --> 50:16.040
I think people who are high are like, Del Taco, I'm sold.

50:16.040 --> 50:20.040
How do we get high people in here to eat our cheap tacos?

50:20.040 --> 50:25.040
Guests looking to try the new chicken cheddar rollers are in for an additional treat.

50:25.040 --> 50:30.040
To celebrate the rollout, Del Taco's Del Yeah rewards members

50:30.040 --> 50:40.040
can get five chicken cheddar rollers for $4.20 on Wednesday, April 20th.

50:40.040 --> 50:44.040
And there's three asterisks there, I guess to stand in for eyebrow raising.

50:44.040 --> 50:47.040
Huh? Huh? Huh? Get it?

50:47.040 --> 50:55.040
For one day only on what Del Taco is calling Roller Days with a Z.

50:55.040 --> 50:59.040
Additionally, fans unable to pop into their local Del Taco restaurant

50:59.040 --> 51:07.040
for the one day only deal can access the offer and free delivery through the Del Taco app.

51:07.040 --> 51:14.040
Del Taco's 420 Roller Days with a Z deal is time to coincide

51:14.040 --> 51:19.040
with the unofficial national cannabis holiday.

51:19.040 --> 51:21.040
God almighty.

51:21.040 --> 51:24.040
It's so great because it goes from like, you have over here Chiba Hut,

51:24.040 --> 51:28.040
who is clearly a cop, to this side where it's like your friend

51:28.040 --> 51:31.040
who just bought marijuana for the first time ever is like,

51:31.040 --> 51:34.040
yeah, I've got some of that stuff.

51:34.040 --> 51:37.040
If you want to come over on.

51:37.040 --> 51:42.040
I understand what Del Taco is saying, but I do have to ask,

51:42.040 --> 51:47.040
what would it take to make it the official cannabis holiday?

51:47.040 --> 51:50.040
Are you envisioning a reality where our incredible,

51:50.040 --> 51:55.040
our incredible by Camaro house is join,

51:55.040 --> 52:00.040
join hands for one gleaming moment and say, let's make this baby official?

52:00.040 --> 52:02.040
There's a lot that we don't see eye to eye on.

52:02.040 --> 52:04.040
We can all agree.

52:04.040 --> 52:08.040
Today's the funny weed day, right?

52:08.040 --> 52:10.040
Let the children out from school.

52:10.040 --> 52:14.040
AOC, Lindsey, you're with me, right?

52:14.040 --> 52:16.040
It's the funny weed day.

52:16.040 --> 52:19.040
Have you seen these fucking values at Del Taco?

52:19.040 --> 52:20.040
Make it official.

52:20.040 --> 52:26.040
The first unanimous vote across all of government, city to federal.

52:26.040 --> 52:30.040
It's coincide with the unofficial national cannabis holiday

52:30.040 --> 52:33.040
to fulfill those mass munchy needs.

52:33.040 --> 52:40.040
But whether you wake and bake or don't partake, fuck off.

52:40.040 --> 52:42.040
Like, seriously?

52:42.040 --> 52:44.040
Oh, thanks for letting me know.

52:44.040 --> 52:46.040
I can buy Del Taco even if I'm not high.

52:46.040 --> 52:48.040
What are you talking about?

52:48.040 --> 52:51.040
Del Taco, presumably you write every other press release

52:51.040 --> 52:53.040
for people who don't smoke weed.

52:53.040 --> 52:56.040
Why do you have to include them in this one?

52:56.040 --> 52:58.040
They can enjoy a smoking deal.

52:58.040 --> 53:04.040
But wait, our tour of the nation's 420 deals would not be complete

53:04.040 --> 53:07.040
without DJ Khaled.

53:07.040 --> 53:10.040
DJ Khaled!

53:10.040 --> 53:12.040
Another one, virtual brand.

53:12.040 --> 53:14.040
DJ Khaled's virtual brand.

53:14.040 --> 53:16.040
What's that mean?

53:16.040 --> 53:19.040
It adds plant-based wings.

53:19.040 --> 53:22.040
Sorry, hold on.

53:22.040 --> 53:24.040
Sorry, hold on.

53:24.040 --> 53:27.040
We've talked about his restaurant before, right?

53:27.040 --> 53:29.040
Yes, I thought so.

53:29.040 --> 53:31.040
It says virtual brand, right?

53:31.040 --> 53:33.040
It's a ghost kitchen.

53:33.040 --> 53:36.040
I would like to think that I have something resembling a virtual brand

53:36.040 --> 53:39.040
and I did not know I could just add chicken wings to it.

53:39.040 --> 53:42.040
I am going to say some of the proper nouns from DJ Khaled's restaurant

53:42.040 --> 53:44.040
as if it is the first time I'm saying them,

53:44.040 --> 53:47.040
but I want you to know I'm saying it because they delight me so much.

53:47.040 --> 53:52.040
DJ Khaled's another wing unveils like wings.

53:52.040 --> 53:55.040
New plant-based additions to its U.S. menu

53:55.040 --> 53:59.040
in partnership with Likemeat, a live kindly collective brand.

53:59.040 --> 54:03.040
The unique collaboration marks Likemeat's first ghost kitchen partnership, etc.

54:03.040 --> 54:06.040
Likemeat's juicy and delicious plant-based wings

54:06.040 --> 54:09.040
come smothered in another wing's signature flavors

54:09.040 --> 54:12.040
including U Loyal lemon pepper,

54:12.040 --> 54:13.040
Wow.

54:13.040 --> 54:16.040
honey, honey, hot honey sriracha.

54:16.040 --> 54:19.040
Sorry, did you add the extra honey for effect?

54:19.040 --> 54:23.040
Honey, honey, hot honey sriracha.

54:23.040 --> 54:29.040
And my personal favorite, they don't want you to win Truffalo.

54:29.040 --> 54:38.040
To celebrate the launch, another wing will co-host a pop-up wing dispensary

54:38.040 --> 54:42.040
aptly named Another Wing Dispensary

54:42.040 --> 54:47.040
in partnership with The Flowery in Miami's Wynwood neighborhood on April 20th.

54:47.040 --> 54:48.040
Oh.

54:48.040 --> 54:49.040
Yeah.

54:49.040 --> 54:53.040
Shit, all these are today, it's too late for me to get any of this stuff.

54:53.040 --> 54:55.040
This is DJ Khaled.

54:55.040 --> 54:59.040
This like wings collaboration is an incredible opportunity

54:59.040 --> 55:04.040
for people who don't eat meat to enjoy the incredible flavors of Another Wing.

55:04.040 --> 55:08.040
As you know, I'm very picky about what I eat, and I'll eat these wings.

55:08.040 --> 55:13.040
This collab combines the flavors of Another Wing with the plant power of Likemeat.

55:13.040 --> 55:15.040
Says DJ Khaled, let's win more.

55:15.040 --> 55:17.040
The noted power expert.

55:17.040 --> 55:19.040
Let's win more with Likewings.

55:19.040 --> 55:21.040
Is it like me? Is that the bit?

55:21.040 --> 55:23.040
Because that's not a good name for it.

55:23.040 --> 55:25.040
All the other ones were taken.

55:25.040 --> 55:27.040
We've already gone beyond meat.

55:27.040 --> 55:29.040
What else do we have?

55:29.040 --> 55:30.040
Beyond, beyond meat.

55:30.040 --> 55:32.040
If someone sent me something and I said, is this meat?

55:32.040 --> 55:34.040
And they said, it's like meat.

55:34.040 --> 55:36.040
Okay, I'm good.

55:36.040 --> 55:41.040
Michelle Collette, the head of food service for Likemeat says,

55:41.040 --> 55:44.040
we're flying high with this new partnership

55:44.040 --> 55:49.040
and are beyond excited for Another Wing's fans to try these awesome Likewings

55:49.040 --> 55:52.040
the next time the munchies strike.

55:54.040 --> 55:55.040
It's not fun anymore.

55:55.040 --> 55:57.040
Yeah, weed's not fun anymore.

55:57.040 --> 55:58.040
Weed's not fun anymore.

55:58.040 --> 56:00.040
Let's change it to another day.

56:00.040 --> 56:02.040
Let's make it July 13th or something.

56:02.040 --> 56:05.040
July 11th, just after the QR code runs out.

56:08.040 --> 56:10.040
This is like July 11th.

56:10.040 --> 56:11.040
That's 7-Eleven.

56:11.040 --> 56:12.040
7-Eleven would love that.

56:12.040 --> 56:14.040
Come on in for that.

56:15.040 --> 56:18.040
I don't think that could be the weed day too.

56:18.040 --> 56:19.040
It's fine.

56:19.040 --> 56:20.040
7-Eleven.

56:20.040 --> 56:24.040
You know, I stopped at the fast mart on the way up here

56:24.040 --> 56:30.040
and I got my snacks and my drink and they said 7-Eleven

56:30.040 --> 56:31.040
and I said, no, it's not.

56:31.040 --> 56:32.040
It's fast mart.

56:32.040 --> 56:33.040
That's good.

56:33.040 --> 56:35.040
And the guy gave me nothing.

56:35.040 --> 56:36.040
I thought it was pretty, anyway.

56:36.040 --> 56:37.040
That's good.

56:37.040 --> 56:41.040
This is Likemeat's first flight into the ghost kitchen world

56:41.040 --> 56:43.040
and we're in it to wing it.

56:44.040 --> 56:46.040
That's not a good thing though.

56:46.040 --> 56:52.040
Described as the world's most ambitious restaurant launch.

56:52.040 --> 56:54.040
Holy shit.

56:54.040 --> 57:00.040
Another wing debuted in November 2021 across 150 locations

57:00.040 --> 57:04.040
and three continents at the same time.

57:04.040 --> 57:08.040
So DJ Khaled has plant-based wings with his grape flavors.

57:08.040 --> 57:09.040
That's the story.

57:09.040 --> 57:13.040
That's all of the 420 that's happening out there.

57:13.040 --> 57:17.040
There's probably much, much, much, much more.

57:17.040 --> 57:18.040
No, there's actually not.

57:18.040 --> 57:19.040
Oh, okay.

57:19.040 --> 57:20.040
You found it all.

57:20.040 --> 57:21.040
Yeah.

57:21.040 --> 57:24.040
A lot of people said I would never be able to find all the weed stuff,

57:24.040 --> 57:25.040
but that's everything.

57:25.040 --> 57:26.040
Good job.

57:26.040 --> 57:39.040
I am a law student.

57:39.040 --> 57:43.040
I've been told by multiple attorneys and professors that it's very important

57:43.040 --> 57:49.040
to have lawyer face, i.e. not showing any reaction or emotion.

57:49.040 --> 57:53.040
The problem is I have an extremely emotive face.

57:53.040 --> 57:56.040
It's not a secret that what I'm feeling at any time.

57:56.040 --> 58:00.040
Brothers, how can I develop a lawyer face?

58:00.040 --> 58:03.040
Do you have any tips for practicing non-reactions?

58:03.040 --> 58:05.040
That's from straight faced in St. Louis.

58:05.040 --> 58:07.040
Are you here?

58:07.040 --> 58:08.040
That's perfect.

58:08.040 --> 58:09.040
Nice.

58:09.040 --> 58:10.040
That's a good story.

58:10.040 --> 58:13.040
Appropriate.

58:13.040 --> 58:15.040
Objection.

58:15.040 --> 58:17.040
Even that was a little too just.

58:17.040 --> 58:20.040
Maybe you could just pick one emotion all the time.

58:20.040 --> 58:21.040
Oh, that's great.

58:21.040 --> 58:24.040
I'm super emotive, but it's always confused.

58:24.040 --> 58:25.040
No, wait.

58:25.040 --> 58:26.040
That's a terrible lawyer.

58:26.040 --> 58:29.040
That's the worst lawyer emotion that you can possibly express.

58:29.040 --> 58:33.040
He got hit by a big truck?

58:33.040 --> 58:34.040
Huh?

58:34.040 --> 58:36.040
There's a video of it?

58:36.040 --> 58:39.040
Oh, no.

58:39.040 --> 58:42.040
But my guy's the truck guy.

58:42.040 --> 58:44.040
Oh, no.

58:44.040 --> 58:47.040
Griffin does raise a fun point.

58:47.040 --> 58:49.040
He was drunk?

58:49.040 --> 58:53.040
That's my guy, though.

58:53.040 --> 58:59.040
Maybe your thing could just be the one super emotive lawyer.

58:59.040 --> 59:02.040
You could be the one who's like, oh, man.

59:02.040 --> 59:04.040
Why is it always disappointing?

59:04.040 --> 59:11.040
Your Honor, and I have here the call logs from that evening.

59:11.040 --> 59:15.040
And you just hear from the back of the place, oh, man.

59:15.040 --> 59:17.040
Not the call logs.

59:17.040 --> 59:18.040
Oh, dang it.

59:18.040 --> 59:19.040
Oh, you were right, Doug.

59:19.040 --> 59:20.040
They found it.

59:20.040 --> 59:22.040
They got it.

59:22.040 --> 59:23.040
You were right.

59:23.040 --> 59:26.040
You said they wouldn't have it, and I said they definitely wouldn't.

59:26.040 --> 59:27.040
You were right.

59:27.040 --> 59:28.040
Oh, man.

59:28.040 --> 59:29.040
I know.

59:29.040 --> 59:30.040
You said they'd find it.

59:30.040 --> 59:31.040
I was like, nah, man.

59:31.040 --> 59:32.040
Steve Jobs locks that shit up.

59:32.040 --> 59:37.040
And then you were like, Steve Jobs famously died a long time ago.

59:37.040 --> 59:39.040
And I said, what?

59:39.040 --> 59:40.040
Hey, Vicky, straight up.

59:40.040 --> 59:41.040
I got to give it to you.

59:41.040 --> 59:43.040
You are a good lawyer, for sure.

59:43.040 --> 59:45.040
I wouldn't have found it in a million years.

59:45.040 --> 59:46.040
That's so choice.

59:46.040 --> 59:49.040
At least you didn't find the bloody clothes, though, did you?

59:49.040 --> 59:50.040
Yay!

59:50.040 --> 59:51.040
Sunk!

59:51.040 --> 59:52.040
Ah, damn it.

59:52.040 --> 59:53.040
Oh, man.

59:53.040 --> 59:54.040
Let's call it a tie.

59:54.040 --> 59:56.040
Hey, Judge.

59:56.040 --> 59:58.040
We will take that plea deal now, actually.

59:58.040 --> 01:00:01.040
Yeah, actually, now that we will do it.

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.040
Is it too late to turn state's evidence?

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.040
That's not a thing in this case?

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.040
Okay.

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.040
Damn.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:13.040
I would say that all lawyer commercials are the same, which is usually a big lawyer standing

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:16.040
on top of a truck holding a hammer or some shit.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:19.040
That's just that one lawyer in Austin.

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:23.040
No, but they're always, they're like throwing lightning bolts down.

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.040
Smiting their enemies.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.040
Smiting doctors.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.040
Or like a truck is, there's a lot of trucks.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:31.040
Like a truck is speeding at them and they just hold up a hand and the truck flips over them.

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:35.040
See, in Cincinnati, there's one guy who just is like, how hard I'll fight for you.

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:39.040
And he has boxing gloves and he's punching a punching bag, which I was like, listen,

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:42.040
if things go south and it doesn't look like you're going to win,

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:46.040
we're going to fight our way out.

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:55.040
But if there was a commercial that for a law firm where everyone in it was crying the whole time,

01:00:55.040 --> 01:01:00.040
I would be too curious to go anywhere else for my legal needs.

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:03.040
You know what, I guarantee that if that was your thing, like in court,

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:07.040
if you get any bad news, I'm going to break into huge tears.

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:10.040
You'd watch the judge like, I'm going to have to rule.

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:11.040
Oh, please don't cry.

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:13.040
Oh no.

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.040
You know what, it is it.

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:15.040
It's a tie.

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.040
It's a tie.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.040
I couldn't.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:21.040
There's an attorney in Austin I'm sure I talked about on the show before called David Comey,

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:24.040
the attorney that rocks.

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.040
He's here.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.040
God, I would fucking love it.

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:31.040
If you are here, David Comey, just come backstage and if someone tries to stop you, push them aside

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.040
because you're very big.

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:39.040
But he does look like a Geico caveman and I've seen so many billboards with this gentleman on it

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:44.040
and been like, that's who I would, that's absolutely who I would rock with if accused of a crime.

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:50.040
He may be bad at being a lawyer, but I'm so curious.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.040
That's a good way to hire anyone.

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.040
Yeah, right?

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:54.040
Yeah.

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:55.040
How bad could it be?

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:57.040
He has good billboards.

01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.040
He rocks.

01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.040
I know he rocks.

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:02.040
You can't just say that without proof.

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:04.040
What's up, guys?

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:07.040
Jurisprudence.

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:10.040
How many points do I get for that?

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:12.040
I'll fight anyone in here.

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:15.040
Kick your ass, judge.

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:18.040
You have to do something more distracting than your face.

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:20.040
Huh.

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.040
I don't have a rest of that paragraph.

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.040
Yeah.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.040
Well, you could be the masked lawyer.

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:27.040
Oh shit.

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:31.040
It works for Magic's Greatest Secrets, that guy.

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:34.040
Yeah, we never found out who that dude was.

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:37.040
Or Magic, I mean, there's Masked Singer, that's huge.

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:38.040
Yeah, that works.

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:39.040
That's never turned out bad.

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:44.040
But then everybody who's like, God, here comes the masked lawyer, I know it's Rudy Giuliani.

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:46.040
How does Masked Singer keep the magic alive?

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:49.040
No, they wouldn't hire him if they thought it was Rudy Giuliani.

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:53.040
Well, that's why he wears a mask.

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:56.040
Of course they wouldn't hire Rudy Giuliani to be there.

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:59.040
Didn't you see Borat 2?

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.040
He's a bad person, Travis.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.040
They wouldn't hire him.

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:03.040
He's bad and mean.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.040
You guys are right.

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:05.040
I really blew that one.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.040
Remember the Four Seasons?

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:08.040
Remember?

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.040
Yeah.

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.040
He's like bad.

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.040
Yeah.

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.040
They wouldn't hire him.

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:14.040
And you remember when the evil ran down his face like Zerg?

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:17.040
You know, like Zerg in Fifth Element?

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.040
You guys remember.

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.040
Remember Ghostbusters?

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:21.040
We're going to lose some fans here, guys.

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:25.040
Rudy Giuliani's bad, and that's the end of this episode.

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.040
We'll say it.

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.040
The cheapest.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:30.040
Our dad came out here in a fucking blues jersey,

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:33.040
and that was the cheapest request for applause, I think,

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:36.040
that we've ever done.

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.040
I want to help more people.

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.040
I'm not done.

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.040
I can't stop.

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.040
I'm the mother of three grown sons.

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:43.040
This is a question.

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:45.040
I'm the mother of three grown sons.

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:48.040
People seem to enjoy asking which is my favorite

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:50.040
or even telling me who they think is my favorite.

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:54.040
I don't have a favorite.

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.040
How can I convince people I love all my boys the same?

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.040
A good, good mom?

01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:59.040
Are you here?

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.040
Okay.

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.040
All right.

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:05.040
Loving them all the same is not the same as not having a favorite.

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:06.040
Thank you, Travis.

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:08.040
Travis speaks from experience.

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:11.040
No more to be said.

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.040
I got two kids.

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:15.040
I love them both equally, and they're both my favorite

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.040
at different times.

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.040
Yeah.

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:20.040
I love my kids equally.

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:23.040
I like my kids different.

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:31.040
One of my kids only refers to me as the big baboon.

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:38.040
And folks, I mean, exclusively, in good times and in bad,

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.040
feast and famine.

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:43.040
Even when she wants something from him, which is fun to watch.

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.040
I am the big baboon.

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:46.040
So guess which of my kids I like better?

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:48.040
Yes, it's that one.

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:51.040
I have self-esteem issues.

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:54.040
What part wasn't a joke, but okay?

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:58.040
You can't tell me that in the history with these three grown sons,

01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:01.040
there wasn't a time where two of them were acting like assholes

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:05.040
and one was being totally chill and cool, and you didn't think,

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.040
thank you.

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:12.040
If you like one more than the others, sometimes don't say anything.

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:13.040
Yeah.

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:14.040
All right.

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.040
All right.

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:17.040
I gotcha.

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:19.040
I have a favorite brother.

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:22.040
That's Paul.

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:25.040
He brings me drinks.

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:29.040
Yeah, everybody has, I mean, I don't think you need to love people.

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.040
You can love somebody.

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:32.040
That goes deeper than liking.

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:35.040
I dislike a lot of people I love sometimes.

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.040
You know, it's normal.

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.040
Why are you looking at me?

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:39.040
It's normal.

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.040
I also think, though, anybody who looks at you and goes,

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.040
who's your favorite?

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.040
They're an asshole.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:44.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.040
It's an unsoaked thing.

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.040
We all get it.

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:48.040
Sometimes you look at your kid and you're like, fuck you.

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:50.040
It happens.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.040
The other option that, sorry, unless.

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:53.040
Unless.

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:56.040
You could also, next time you're asked that question, you say,

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:57.040
well, let's take it to the leaderboard.

01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:01.040
And then you have a big leaderboard with points.

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:04.040
I have one of those at home, and I'm like, Henry, I wrote here,

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:07.040
elbowed your dad right in the penis while you were flossing.

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.040
Minus 50 points.

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:11.040
Wait, what kind of flossing?

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:12.040
The dance.

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:17.040
If you could stand up and demonstrate real quick, just like.

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:19.040
We really showed you, Justin.

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:21.040
It was a little frenzy, but I'm really excited.

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:23.040
Will you teach me that later?

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.040
Because my kids keep it.

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.040
I'm going to give you a deal.

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.040
Teach you how to floss.

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:27.040
I'll teach you how to dougie.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.040
Fair?

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.040
That sounds totally fair.

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:30.040
I abstain.

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:32.040
Yeah.

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:36.040
And that's why dad likes him the least.

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:39.040
I remember going up and dad would look at us like, dougie on three.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.040
And I'd be like, wait, I can't, dad, no.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.040
It hasn't been invented yet.

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:45.040
The Cali swag boys are at nursery school.

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:51.040
To step outside the bit, Justin's been talking about dougieing a lot lately.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.040
Seemingly, too.

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:56.040
It's been like a recursive thing where he said, oh, I'll do this thing right.

01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:57.040
Teach me how to dougie.

01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:59.040
And we said, no one talks about that anymore.

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:03.040
And he took that as a challenge to talk about it a lot more.

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:11.040
I feel like he got a promo code from masterclass to learn how to dougie.

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:14.040
Which, you know, we all get promo codes from masterclass all the time.

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:17.040
Right, and that's what you elect to spend yours on.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.040
Do you want someone to ask you?

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:20.040
Is that the problem?

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:22.040
No, I don't want anyone to ask me.

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:30.040
First, they must scale the 7,000 steps of his sacred mountain to find his temple at the top where he awaits.

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:33.040
Waiting for the true pupil.

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:39.040
There you'll find Justin, but wait, it's Tilda Swinton in a Justin outfit.

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:42.040
Didn't expect that, did you?

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:44.040
Oh, shit.

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:45.040
Just pick a favorite son.

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:48.040
Hey, thank you so much for coming to our program.

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:54.040
We appreciate you very much.

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:57.040
I want to say thank you to, gosh, where to start?

01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:02.040
Clint McElroy.

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:06.040
Who's lovely book, Goldie's Guide to Grandchilding, I think May 10th.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:07.040
May 10th.

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.040
Order it.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:10.040
Don't throw it on the stage and piss on it.

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:12.040
I feel real bad about it.

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:13.040
Or pretend to piss on it.

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:14.040
Both equally bad, I think.

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:19.040
Thank you to Paul Sabourin.

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:27.040
Thank you so much to Rachel and Amanda for being here and helping to support us and recording our shows and making sure the trains run on time.

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.040
Thank you.

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:29.040
Thank you to the Stevel Theatre.

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:30.040
Thank you, Stevel Theatre.

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:31.040
Beautiful.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.040
Thank you to my wife, Rachel.

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:37.040
My wife.

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:39.040
For everything.

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:41.040
Thank you to my partner, Teresa.

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:43.040
I'm not going to give you the setup.

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.040
My wife.

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:45.040
My wife.

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:46.040
Okay.

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:51.040
My wife, Teresa, for being here and being supportive and to my kids for being here.

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.040
Justin, anything you want to say?

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:57.040
When I walked through the airport today, I could not wipe the smile from my face.

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.040
Everyone would ask me, Justin, how's it going?

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:03.040
And I'd say, I'm traveling without my kids.

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:06.040
If you want, I could fly.

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:08.040
And so I love you guys.

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:10.040
I hope you're doing good.

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:17.040
Thank you to Montaigne for the use of our theme song, My Life is Better with You.

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.040
Okay.

01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:21.040
Now we need a celebrity impression.

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:22.040
This is the dumb.

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:23.040
How did this?

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.040
Someone here.

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:26.040
The first like three rows.

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:27.040
Yeah.

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:28.040
Just raise your hand if you have a good one.

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:29.040
Okay.

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.040
Yes.

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:31.040
Yeah.

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.040
Right here.

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:33.040
Oh.

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.040
Yeah.

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:35.040
Dearly departed Gilbert Garfrey.

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.040
Go ahead.

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:37.040
Whenever you're ready.

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:38.040
Please tasteful.

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:39.040
He's a little respectful.

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:40.040
Please, Griffin.

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:41.040
He's not dead.

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.040
He is dead.

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:45.040
Yeah, Griffin.

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:48.040
I wish we'd let him do it before we told him.

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:49.040
Griffin, go on.

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:51.040
I'm so sorry, Griffin.

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:55.040
Now this, I will say we've done a lot of live shows.

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:58.040
This is a unique energy to close on.

01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:03.040
Please just one sentence.

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:04.040
Griffin, do anything.

01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:05.040
Griffin, please end the show.

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:06.040
Just end the show.

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:11.040
Just say something like Gilbert Garfrey and we'll talk about it after.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.040
Please.

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:13.040
Please, Griffin.

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.040
Listen, folks.

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:15.040
Shut up.

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:29.040
Because this is a fucking tribute now.

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.040
I feel it too.

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:32.040
Listen, folks.

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:35.040
I made a few mistakes here and there.

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:37.040
Told a joke or two I shouldn't have told.

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.040
But it's me, your friend Iago.

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:41.040
Remember me forever.

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:43.040
My great contribute.

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:44.040
I can't do it.

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:45.040
My name's Justin O'Connor.

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:47.040
My name's Justin McElroy.

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:49.040
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:51.040
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.040
This is my brother, my brother and me.

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.040
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.

01:10:54.040 --> 01:11:09.040
It's better, it's better with you.

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:22.040
It's better, it's better with you.

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:33.040
It's better, it's better with you.
