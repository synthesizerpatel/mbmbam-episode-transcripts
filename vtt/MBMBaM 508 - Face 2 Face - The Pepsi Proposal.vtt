WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.480
Hey, this is Griffin. Real quick, wanted to preface this one by saying it's a live show,

00:48.480 --> 00:54.960
which is strange to listen to these days from the before times from when we performed on the

00:54.960 --> 01:01.840
Joko Cruise, which was just going off my own sort of internal calendar about 400

01:01.840 --> 01:09.040
patrillion-scrillion-minillion-thousand-trillion years ago. So it's actually cut together from

01:09.040 --> 01:13.680
a couple of shows that we did on the Joko Cruise, so it's a bit patchwork and a bit weird,

01:14.640 --> 01:21.280
and you know, we edited out a lot of very extremely local boat-specific humor. But yes,

01:21.280 --> 01:25.520
that is the episode this week. We were not able to record a new one. We will be back with a regular

01:25.520 --> 01:32.640
episode next week. Until then, enjoy this incredibly strange thing to listen to of our

01:33.360 --> 01:42.080
ma-boom-bam goofery aboard the Joko Cruise. I run an after-school fantasy larp for eight to

01:42.080 --> 01:48.640
twelve-year-olds, and I write the story and play all the major NPCs that the characters,

01:48.640 --> 01:53.840
kids' characters encounter. The problem is that I'm not a very intimidating person.

01:53.840 --> 01:56.880
You're gonna need to start over. I missed all of those words.

01:58.240 --> 02:03.120
I run an after-school fantasy larp for eight to twelve-year-olds. I don't know why I almost

02:03.120 --> 02:07.360
turned it into a Barenaked Lady song. I run an after-school fantasy larp for eight to

02:07.360 --> 02:10.560
twelve-year-olds, and I write the story and I play all of the major roles.

02:10.560 --> 02:11.920
Wait, I didn't...

02:11.920 --> 02:17.040
The problem is that I am not a very intimidating person. So even when I try to portray an

02:17.040 --> 02:23.040
appropriately scary villain, the kids tend to always think, quote, we can take them and mob me.

02:23.760 --> 02:26.880
Brothers, how can I strike fear into the hearts of gamer children?

02:27.440 --> 02:37.440
That is from Cora. Cora, are you here? All right, much better. Nailed it. Got it in one.

02:37.440 --> 02:40.800
Much better. Nailed it. Got it in one.

02:43.200 --> 02:50.480
When I was a gamer child, the thing I think I was most afraid of

02:51.920 --> 02:56.720
was having to mow the lawn. Can you dress up as a lawnmower that they would have to use?

02:56.720 --> 03:03.680
Can you dress up as chores? Can you dress up as the idea of reformatting a memory card?

03:03.680 --> 03:09.040
Can you dress up as the concept of your dad really thinks you'd be good at baseball?

03:09.040 --> 03:12.480
So get out there, Tiger. Just whisper in their ear, like,

03:13.520 --> 03:17.520
I took all your V-bucks. When you weren't watching, I took all your what?

03:17.520 --> 03:20.880
V-bucks is the Fortnite money. God, I hate doing this show with old people.

03:23.040 --> 03:26.240
None of them reacted. They loved it. They were scared.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.560
V-bucks? They were scared that their Fortnite money would be...

03:28.560 --> 03:31.280
That sounds like something that happens at Bucky Cheeses.

03:31.280 --> 03:38.480
Now, Justin, I hate to stifle your creativity over there, but as you approach to Whisper This,

03:38.480 --> 03:43.840
they've already thrown a balled-up wad of tinfoil at you, hitting you for 15 points of electricity damage.

03:43.840 --> 03:49.280
Is there a safe way to set kids on fire? Just like...

03:49.280 --> 03:53.760
Oh, safe fire. A safe fire for kids?

03:54.800 --> 03:58.880
Yeah. This one was sent in by Adrian Cowles. Thank you, Adrian.

03:58.880 --> 04:04.080
Adrian, you're not here, are you?

04:04.080 --> 04:08.080
No, that'd be wild. We're in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. That would be fucking bizarre.

04:10.480 --> 04:15.440
So this is an anonymous Yahoo Answers user I'm gonna call. Aquaman asks,

04:17.600 --> 04:22.560
how did the first parents know how to take care of their children?

04:22.560 --> 04:29.840
Fuck, yeah. Yeah, right? Right? Yeah. It must have been weird the first time the baby shit in a diaper,

04:29.840 --> 04:31.520
and you're like, where do we get more diapers?

04:36.320 --> 04:41.120
Sorry, we're all parents up here, and we know this crowd skews younger,

04:41.120 --> 04:46.160
so when the baby is born and come out, it has a diaper.

04:46.160 --> 04:52.480
Yeah. And it's called, it's birth diaper. And you know how just like in movies, right,

04:53.760 --> 05:01.120
baby come out, start screaming. Has diaper. Yes. Person with milk glands just start spraying it out

05:01.120 --> 05:07.520
like super sugar? That must have been weird for... Yeah, like, hey, Doug, I think I'm making food.

05:09.280 --> 05:13.600
I don't want to like freak you out. Hey, are we having a weird party? Yeah, I think I'm making

05:13.600 --> 05:21.680
food right now. Isn't that wild? Let's put it in little U's mouth. Yeah, see if they like other food.

05:21.680 --> 05:24.960
And that must have been frustrating. You're like, hey, put on baby shark. It's like,

05:24.960 --> 05:32.240
what the fuck is baby shark? There is a baby shark over here. Put baby shark on baby? No.

05:32.240 --> 05:36.560
Honey, he wants to play with the baby sharks. I don't know what to tell you. Well, I mean,

05:36.560 --> 05:44.240
I mean, a small me just came out of you. Maybe feed it some of the brontosaurus? Oh, nope. Nope.

05:44.240 --> 05:49.280
Now we gotta wait to next baby. But this is it. Trial and error. We'll get this right sometime,

05:49.280 --> 05:55.280
baby. Baby do bad. We should have done the you milk that's coming. Yes, Travis. At some point,

05:55.280 --> 06:02.240
that baby, that successful baby, started talking. That must have freaked him the fuck out.

06:02.240 --> 06:10.080
What? Oh my God. This weird small you pet is turning into a you. It isn't like right now,

06:10.080 --> 06:17.840
your hamster went, I actually would love a carrot. What? Where's my hamster? It's at school.

06:17.840 --> 06:24.960
What? And now I have to teach you to drive? Where did we get a car? You teach us to drive

06:24.960 --> 06:31.600
a dinosaur. Yeah, obviously. Yeah, obviously. This seems like the type of crowd that would

06:31.600 --> 06:36.720
actually get very angry and send some things on Twitter about how human beings and dinosaurs

06:36.720 --> 06:44.560
didn't exist at the same time. As far as we know, yes. It's a bit and a goof. Let me point towards

06:44.560 --> 06:52.560
the documentary Flintstones. Yes. Griffin, if dinosaurs and human beings didn't exist at the

06:52.560 --> 07:00.720
same time, how do we know about them? How do we know about them? How do they play their records?

07:00.720 --> 07:06.160
Oh yeah. Because? Yours is a Flintstone. Okay. Yes. Justin, how about another question? Yeah,

07:06.160 --> 07:09.840
here it comes. Because we, hey Jews, we could say a lot of Flintstones things up here,

07:09.840 --> 07:12.640
but I think it would be good for us to go to another question. How do they make vitamins?

07:12.640 --> 07:18.320
Yes. Cereal. How do we still have their cereals? Jurassic Park, it would just,

07:18.320 --> 07:22.320
they wouldn't look like dinosaurs, they'd look like big weird monsters because we didn't see them.

07:22.320 --> 07:26.800
Right. With our human eyes. Not like the super accurate Jurassic Park. We're fucking dying up

07:26.800 --> 07:35.680
here, Justin, please. Thank you. We got a Honda Doll Watch. Oh fuck, we didn't ask before, but

07:35.680 --> 07:43.040
who in this room has no idea who we are? Okay. Oh shit. Oh no. Okay, so Honda Doll Watch is a segment

07:43.040 --> 07:49.680
on the show where we find Honda dolls for sale on the electronic bay and see what the story with

07:49.680 --> 07:57.120
those are, because that's wild. This doll is called Melissa Tangible. Holy shit, that's a good name.

07:57.120 --> 08:01.600
It's a fucking good name, actually. Melissa Tangible is what this doll is listed as. Meet

08:01.600 --> 08:08.720
Melissa. Melissa is, they don't say, it doesn't say to the tune of Train. Meet Melissa. Melissa

08:08.720 --> 08:14.480
is what she likes to be called. Oh. Though a tangible doll, she was neither human nor non-human.

08:14.480 --> 08:22.160
Okay, that's everything. That's actually all the things. Everything. Are you actually skipped

08:22.160 --> 08:26.960
over the first part of that sentence? Read that one more time for me. Meet Melissa. Nope. Though

08:26.960 --> 08:34.560
a tangible doll. Like all dolls. No. There are intangible dolls. Travis. Do not step to Justin

08:34.560 --> 08:38.720
on this exact subject. On the electronic bay, sometimes you get a doll, sometimes you get a

08:38.720 --> 08:43.440
picture of a doll, because they're not specific about it being a tangible doll. I would argue

08:43.440 --> 08:49.600
that even there, it's a doll one could conceive. No, it's not. I don't think you know what the

08:49.600 --> 08:57.920
word tangible means. Fuck. That is the actual problem. She is a pure evil, tangible, physical

08:57.920 --> 09:04.400
doll. As a seller, I'd like my customers to know that my house backs up 600 acres of woods.

09:04.400 --> 09:07.280
On the other side of those woods is a medium-sized cemetery.

09:07.280 --> 09:17.040
So, important things for all of us to know. So I assume your house backs up in like a 300...

09:17.040 --> 09:23.280
Incorrect. 600 acre woods, and it's a medium-sized cemetery. So that's the kind of like oaky tannins

09:23.280 --> 09:30.160
you can expect from this. The terrar of this haunted doll is extremely good. I'm sorry to

09:30.160 --> 09:37.840
keep revealing my known ass. How big is an acre? Is 600 acres between your house and a cemetery

09:37.840 --> 09:42.640
a good distance? Well, Winnie the Pooh lived in a... Winnie the Pooh lived in a 100 acre one,

09:42.640 --> 09:47.840
so it's six times better than him. Oh shit. And the Winnie the Pooh cemetery was quite large.

09:49.120 --> 09:55.600
It was every animal ever. Eeyore lived in it, and that's why he was kind of bummed out. I'm sad.

09:55.600 --> 10:03.360
Oh, why? Because... No, because of the spirits. You don't understand. I've never had a night's rest.

10:03.360 --> 10:10.880
This isn't... The wailing. This isn't my tale. That's right. Think of the implications.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.640
I'm a patchwork monstrosity. It's the telltale tale. Yeah.

10:16.640 --> 10:31.760
Don't patronize him. The ghosts come a-runnin' when they hear the spirit box. I do believe

10:31.760 --> 10:36.480
that that is why I have so many negative or evil spirits on my property and in my home.

10:36.480 --> 10:43.280
This spirit, however, really does not have a name. We agreed on Melissa. She seems to like that,

10:43.280 --> 10:48.400
although she is neither female nor male. We have established that she is neither human

10:48.400 --> 10:54.480
nor non-human. I don't think we need any more specifics. This spirit, you must be 18 or over

10:54.480 --> 11:04.400
to purchase. What? Also, this spirit is for the dark arts only or seasoned investigators.

11:04.400 --> 11:13.280
Oh, okay, I'm back in. Okay, yeah. This is my favorite. I bought her at another consignment

11:13.280 --> 11:23.520
shop and she was not a haunted doll. However, she is now. Huh. Yeah, huh. Funny how that works.

11:23.520 --> 11:28.800
Yeah, okay. Jesus Christ. Is this person's house for sale? Because it sounds like maybe

11:28.800 --> 11:36.240
it's a haunted doll factory. Yeah, quick point for you, Fire Torch Findings on eBay. You probably

11:36.240 --> 11:43.440
shouldn't buy more dolls. That's maybe where I would start is your house transmogrifies

11:43.440 --> 11:49.600
regular dolls into bad evil dolls that are neither human nor non-human but are named Melissa.

11:49.600 --> 11:56.480
Hey, why do you think this eBay user bought the doll carcass in the first place? Well,

11:56.480 --> 12:03.120
we have a name for doll carcasses, Trav, and they're dolls. It's just a regular doll. I do

12:03.120 --> 12:09.920
like this backstory, though, of I'm just a doll lover purchaser and now this one's haunted, so

12:09.920 --> 12:15.440
I got to get rid of it. I created a whole eBay account. Yeah, for this one specific one and

12:15.440 --> 12:21.840
according to the listing, the 270 other haunted dolls that they have in there. Sorry about your

12:21.840 --> 12:29.760
luck. What keeps happening? What's the connective tissue? Anyway, that is Haunted Doll Watch.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.920
Hey, how about another question? I'd love that, Griff. Thank you so much.

12:36.640 --> 12:41.040
My boyfriend says bless you after I cough. This makes me feel very uncomfortable.

12:42.240 --> 12:46.480
How can I get him to stop? And that's from Bless You in Boston. My boyfriend says,

12:46.480 --> 12:52.160
is the uncomfortable thing that that is not when we do that or is it what they're actually

12:52.160 --> 12:58.080
saying, do you think? What part is causing the discomfort? Well, can it be both? Because it is

12:58.080 --> 13:05.680
both of the things. Okay, let's try it out. Oh, bless you. What do you say back?

13:06.880 --> 13:14.320
I would say thank you for the blessing. Have you heard the good news? And then I would bow.

13:14.320 --> 13:20.000
Bow like, oh, like that? Yes. Let me try. I'll cough. Okay.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.120
Hack'em, hack'em, hack'em. Bless you. And also with you.

13:26.160 --> 13:30.960
Nice, religious. Do you want to try? Yeah, so, okay.

13:33.680 --> 13:37.040
Bless you. You will never take Jenny from me.

13:37.040 --> 13:44.560
Okay. That's that kind of possession thing. We've got three different good options.

13:44.560 --> 13:48.000
Yeah, he'll definitely stop after one of those. Hold on, let me do it. I'll do it.

13:49.760 --> 13:51.920
Bless you. I wish you'd stop doing that.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.680
Okay, I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now about our relationship.

14:00.240 --> 14:05.680
Oh, hold on. Bring me some popcorn. You always fucking do this, Jerrick.

14:05.680 --> 14:10.240
Jerrick, I want to move back to Portland with my sister.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.680
Wow, a new vibe. Okay, what's next? What happens next?

14:15.680 --> 14:18.320
You know what? You're right. Okay.

14:18.320 --> 14:22.000
I think we can make this work. Honest communication, I'm loving it.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.720
Once I get out of here, we can be together. My character's in prison.

14:29.040 --> 14:34.160
Well, we'll see about that. Three, two, one, blast off.

14:34.160 --> 14:38.480
Oh, no. Wait, what is happening now?

14:38.480 --> 14:41.520
I'm in a rocket ship now. To where?

14:41.520 --> 14:44.880
Portland, Oregon. Well, here's my brother,

14:44.880 --> 14:47.360
Elon Musk. Aw.

14:47.360 --> 14:50.800
Two. He built a rocket ship for me.

14:50.800 --> 14:54.080
Oh, no. It's an old-fashioned breakup rocket ship chase.

14:54.080 --> 14:58.880
Yeah, and it's a steampunk rocket ship, so you know it's cooler, guys.

14:58.880 --> 15:02.160
And what's that? It's Captain Mal Reynolds. Oh, shit.

15:02.160 --> 15:06.720
Anyways, do you want to have sex in front of Captain Mal Reynolds?

15:06.720 --> 15:11.280
Actually, Travis, I stopped playing the part, like, 15 seconds ago.

15:11.280 --> 15:16.640
So now it's just uncomfortable. And so for me, Trav, that's a firm no.

15:16.640 --> 15:20.720
How about Yahoo? Yeah, here is a Yahoo from the Yahoo

15:20.720 --> 15:25.920
Answer Service. This one was sent in by several people,

15:25.920 --> 15:30.720
and it's sort of just like a fun sort of linguistics, like, origin, like,

15:30.720 --> 15:34.720
a smart people thing. For all the smarts on this here boat.

15:34.720 --> 15:39.360
Anybody here smart? Okay, a lot of people sent this in.

15:39.360 --> 15:43.280
It's from Yahoo Answers user Negotiator, who asks...

15:43.280 --> 15:49.280
I like that. What exactly is a gravy train?

15:49.280 --> 15:55.280
Oh, boy. I assume it is. Travis, don't assume.

15:55.280 --> 16:01.120
Okay. Know it. From a book you read

16:01.120 --> 16:05.600
about this subject yesterday. Thank you. You know how

16:05.600 --> 16:09.600
there are trains full of... Yeah. Gasoline.

16:09.600 --> 16:16.000
Yeah. Okay. I see where this is going. You're saying... Are you trying to say

16:16.000 --> 16:19.040
that maybe... How else does gravy get places?

16:19.040 --> 16:23.200
Thank you. Are you saying maybe that cars use

16:23.200 --> 16:26.880
gasoline, like, they call gasoline gravy as, like, slang?

16:26.880 --> 16:30.160
Yeah. Like, gravy is slang for gasoline?

16:30.160 --> 16:35.280
Yes. No. So, somebody has a big gasoline train? Not now.

16:35.280 --> 16:39.280
Not now. I'm saying a hundred years ago. Travis is embarrassed, and he's trying to walk it back.

16:39.280 --> 16:42.880
I have never been embarrassed in my entire life. Have you heard the jokes I

16:42.880 --> 16:46.880
make on this show? I'm saying a hundred years ago, everyone

16:46.880 --> 16:50.480
said, oh, yeah, Henry Ford and his car gravy.

16:50.480 --> 16:55.680
He loves that shit. We're not talking about... And that was before

16:55.680 --> 17:00.560
cars existed. Right. We don't say they're in the gravy

17:00.560 --> 17:03.120
car. They're not driving the gravy Prius and

17:03.120 --> 17:05.840
getting great gravy mileage. No, they just say

17:05.840 --> 17:08.800
horsepower. They say horsepower, which is a fun

17:08.800 --> 17:12.720
another... We're not actually going to talk about smart shit on the stage, Travis.

17:12.720 --> 17:15.760
We're talking about the gravy train. People say it.

17:15.760 --> 17:20.560
Why, Justin? The weird thing is that the gravy train is good.

17:20.560 --> 17:24.480
Yes. That is the surprising thing. Like, that has pulled into town.

17:24.480 --> 17:28.240
I'm feeling pretty good about this gravy train. It's arrived. That does mean at

17:28.240 --> 17:31.520
some point, somebody had something that could be

17:31.520 --> 17:36.720
referred to as the gravy train and said, thank God. Yes, yes, it's here.

17:36.720 --> 17:39.280
My matcha potatoes are getting extremely cold.

17:39.280 --> 17:43.440
Thank goodness the gravy train has arrived. A butler came in going,

17:43.440 --> 17:46.080
chugga-chugga.

17:46.960 --> 17:53.760
Chugga-chugga. Would master like... Okay, hold on. They don't say the gravy

17:53.760 --> 17:58.320
train car. It's a... Every car in the gravy train

17:58.320 --> 18:01.840
is a gravy train. It's a gravy locomotive. A gravy... A gravy

18:01.840 --> 18:05.120
caboose. Everything is gravy, gravy, gravy, gravy. A

18:05.120 --> 18:11.280
gravy sleeper car. Yes. Slosh, slosh, slosh.

18:11.280 --> 18:15.120
Do any of y'all know why it's gravy train when we say that?

18:15.120 --> 18:18.160
No, but really. Just shout it out all at once.

18:18.160 --> 18:23.120
Because there is a gravy boat. So we're all just saying that constantly and

18:23.120 --> 18:26.240
have no idea what it means. I see someone pointing to

18:26.240 --> 18:29.120
someone. Are you pointing at anyone? Are you a train,

18:29.120 --> 18:32.800
sir? I swear to God. Hey, come here. No, no, no.

18:32.800 --> 18:36.720
If this is a joke, I'm gonna be fucking furious.

18:36.720 --> 18:40.000
Okay, everyone be completely silent. I just wanted you to go, okay.

18:40.000 --> 18:46.320
Yell it. Yell. Yell about gravy trains. Oh, fuck off. No, not what your parents told

18:46.320 --> 18:48.960
you. Unless your parents are gravy train

18:48.960 --> 18:52.560
conductors. No, keep going. Keep going. I want to hear.

18:52.560 --> 18:56.400
So it's the wagon that has all the food in it in like a convoy. Hey, don't you all

18:56.400 --> 19:01.840
clap? No, that was good. Like a wagon train.

19:01.840 --> 19:06.000
And there was one wagon that had all the gravy. The wet brown one

19:06.000 --> 19:10.240
that had all the gravy in it. But here's the thing. That person stood up with

19:10.240 --> 19:13.840
confidence and said that made up bullshit.

19:13.840 --> 19:16.960
And you all tried to clap like we all knew that too.

19:16.960 --> 19:20.240
The next time you fucking join us. What's better?

19:20.240 --> 19:24.640
What they said or the idea of a train that every time it turns a corner a

19:24.640 --> 19:27.200
little bit of gravy sloshes out every window.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.320
Which world would you rather live in? And that's where

19:30.320 --> 19:36.160
corn comes from. Hey, how about another Yahoo? Yeah, I'd

19:36.160 --> 19:40.960
love that. Thank you. So, this one's

19:40.960 --> 19:44.960
presented by Adrian Cowes as well. Thank you, Adrian. It's from Yahoo

19:44.960 --> 19:51.520
Answers user Blue Fox Socks who asks

19:51.520 --> 19:56.160
I wish hot salad existed. Anyone else?

19:56.160 --> 20:02.800
Now, hold on. Hey. Calm down. Let's all open our minds. Let's play in the space.

20:02.800 --> 20:07.280
Yeah, let's check it out. I'm seeing some very enthusiastic thumbs up from a

20:07.280 --> 20:12.960
one to two people in the audience. You're now on a list of my own creation.

20:12.960 --> 20:17.280
I'm sorry. You all also know that like warm spinach

20:17.280 --> 20:21.200
salad is a thing. No, that's nothing. It's not hot though.

20:21.200 --> 20:24.160
To be fair. Yeah, we're talking about a salad that you put in your mouth and go

20:24.160 --> 20:28.240
I do like that they started calling it warm

20:28.240 --> 20:31.600
spinach salad because room temperature spinach salad is

20:31.600 --> 20:35.680
pretty nasty. You know, I actually had one of these

20:35.680 --> 20:39.600
I think last night. Did anyone make you? Well, the nice thing about being on a

20:39.600 --> 20:42.480
cruise ship is you can put fucking anything on a salad. Nobody's

20:42.480 --> 20:45.840
gonna say anything to you. So, I got a regular salad and the lady

20:45.840 --> 20:48.160
looked at me with like pride as I walked away like,

20:48.160 --> 20:51.120
dang, Justin really did a good job. Yeah. What a good salad boy. That's a lot of

20:51.120 --> 20:54.240
cookie points. I'm so proud of him and then as soon as I fucking hove out of

20:54.240 --> 20:56.720
view from her eyesight, I handed my bowl to the person

20:56.720 --> 20:59.840
on the counter is like, can you throw some grits on there please?

20:59.840 --> 21:06.240
Some grits Travis. Grits? Grits for dressing.

21:06.240 --> 21:12.880
It's 2020. I'm changing the game. Grits for dressing. This is from a man

21:12.880 --> 21:18.240
who used to put marinara as dressing. That's old news.

21:18.240 --> 21:21.840
Hey Juice. The new shit is grits on dressing.

21:21.840 --> 21:25.360
Rule of thumb, if you can throw something at a wall

21:25.360 --> 21:29.200
and it sticks there, that's not dressing. Hey Griffin.

21:29.200 --> 21:34.160
Pasta salad. That's a salad not a dressing. That's a salad not a dressing but

21:34.160 --> 21:37.760
good try. Wow. What do you think the next peanut butter dressing?

21:37.760 --> 21:42.320
What's next Juice? What's hot for spring 2020?

21:42.320 --> 21:46.640
You'll have to ask the fine chefs here at the New Amsterdam what they plan on

21:46.640 --> 21:50.240
putting at the bar. They didn't offer grits Justin.

21:50.240 --> 21:53.920
They didn't offer grits. Grits wasn't on the list of dresses.

21:53.920 --> 22:00.080
That was Chez Justine. I love you so much. There is no way that they said

22:00.080 --> 22:05.680
ranch, vinaigrette, grits. Here's the food grits. Here's what

22:05.680 --> 22:09.200
you're gonna give. Do you want some porridge on there baby bear?

22:09.200 --> 22:13.680
Someone from the dive in outside was like, you want a hot dog on it?

22:13.680 --> 22:18.960
We'll blend it up real good. You can sip it in.

22:18.960 --> 22:23.280
We'll put the whole thing in the blender. You won't even have to look at it.

22:23.280 --> 22:27.120
Hey, how you doing grits? How low is the bottom of the barrel?

22:27.120 --> 22:32.560
How about just a bowl full of grits with one spinach on top?

22:32.560 --> 22:37.600
Hun, now you're like a big man. Prove them wrong.

22:37.600 --> 22:43.920
Anything can be a salad. Fuck you. Do you want a big bowl of honey?

22:43.920 --> 22:49.440
Winnie the Pooh. Here's what you get with grits as a dressing.

22:49.440 --> 22:56.240
One, judgment. Two, texture. Three, warmth.

22:56.240 --> 23:00.080
Four, it's everything salad isn't and now they're together.

23:00.080 --> 23:04.880
It fixes both. It's both okay because grits and salad.

23:04.880 --> 23:10.080
Hey listen, if you have synaesthesia, please never eat a grit salad. It sounds

23:10.080 --> 23:13.680
like the worst possible sensory experience.

23:13.680 --> 23:18.800
No, it's good. I can imagine. It had lemonade. I dumped the glass in

23:18.800 --> 23:22.960
and someone paid me three dollars to eat it. My wife asked me where the lettuce

23:22.960 --> 23:25.040
was and I had to look at her honestly and say,

23:25.040 --> 23:28.320
I no longer remember if there's lettuce in here.

23:28.320 --> 23:33.600
Justin, did you eat a bowl of grits? I might have made a KFC famous bowl, sort

23:33.600 --> 23:38.240
of sweetened one, accidentally. I could have sworn I did

23:38.240 --> 23:43.520
get some salad stuff on there. Pretty sure about it.

23:43.520 --> 23:46.560
You know it's bad when you're at the salad bar and you have to point at least

23:46.560 --> 23:50.240
four different things to be like, what's that? I'm not that familiar

23:50.240 --> 23:53.840
with, can I have the little round ones? Do you mean chickpeas? Okay, cool. Yeah, yeah,

23:53.840 --> 23:57.760
yeah, absolutely. Give me those Pac-Man pellets. Yeah, give

23:57.760 --> 24:12.800
me that. Sorry, I messed up in that sense. I'm sorry.

24:12.800 --> 24:16.560
I hope everybody's enjoying the show. I sure am.

24:16.560 --> 24:21.360
And I have bad news for you. While you have been so distracted,

24:21.360 --> 24:26.400
if you will reach up and feel an area of your body that normally grows hair

24:26.400 --> 24:30.320
where you would rather there not be hair, I'll know. There it is.

24:30.320 --> 24:34.240
Oh, I don't worry about that. I'm happy to grow hair all over my body, as anyone

24:34.240 --> 24:37.600
who has seen me at the pool will attest. It's kind of a Rip Van Winkle

24:37.600 --> 24:40.640
situation, but sort of like a small one. You don't have like a full

24:40.640 --> 24:44.000
lush white beard, but it's more just like a

24:44.000 --> 24:47.840
general growth. Oh, this is just my peach fuzz.

24:47.840 --> 24:51.600
I have good news for you, though.

24:51.600 --> 25:01.280
There's razors. Harry's is a company that makes a great shaving experience,

25:01.280 --> 25:06.720
quality, durable blades at a fair price, like two bucks per blade, and they've

25:06.720 --> 25:10.960
cut out the middle person manufacturing blades in their German

25:10.960 --> 25:14.320
blade factory, which is a fine thing to do at a German

25:14.320 --> 25:18.720
blade factory, if you ask me. I'm a layman. They've been hunting

25:18.720 --> 25:23.120
precision blades for a century. You want to try a better shave?

25:23.120 --> 25:28.000

25:55.120 --> 25:59.280
you guys think, which, the people who work at

25:59.280 --> 26:01.760
Harry's, what do you think is their favorite

26:01.760 --> 26:07.760
Wesley Snipes movie? Well, I don't know, Trav, what's your joke?

26:07.760 --> 26:12.320
Blade. Probably Bridges of Madison County. It's Blade. I don't think Wesley Snipes

26:12.320 --> 26:17.360
was in that one, was he? Blade. He played actually the bridge.

26:17.360 --> 26:21.520
What do you think is their favorite Jessica Alba movie?

26:21.520 --> 26:24.480
I think it's Honey.

26:24.960 --> 26:31.200
And listen, we all shop online a lot, and finding promo codes to buy

26:31.200 --> 26:35.680
Jessica Alba's complete movie discography. Is that something, is there a

26:35.680 --> 26:39.360
criterion collection of just Jessica Alba movies of like Honey

26:39.360 --> 26:46.080
and Fantastic Four, and the Alba album? Yes, the Albatross.

26:46.080 --> 26:48.640
Do you think she ever got called the Albatross in high school? Anyways, back to

26:48.640 --> 26:52.800
the back to the copy. It is an easy one. No, this is in the

26:52.800 --> 26:57.120
copy. Holy cow. Yeah, and then talk about Jessica Alba a

26:57.120 --> 27:01.440
lot. Here it says some suggestions. Talk about Jessica Alba,

27:01.440 --> 27:05.760
then it says, bullet point, have you ever noticed how Albatross has Alba in it?

27:05.760 --> 27:09.440
Maybe that's something. God, it was even better the second time,

27:09.440 --> 27:13.360
Justin, wasn't it? So I'm losing it over here. I will take

27:13.360 --> 27:17.760
this ad from you by force, please. I'm begging you. Okay, so finding promo

27:17.760 --> 27:21.440
codes that work isn't easy. Said that.

27:21.440 --> 27:25.200
Unless you use Honey, the free browser extension

27:25.200 --> 27:28.720
backed by PayPal that scans the internet for the best promo codes and

27:28.720 --> 27:32.480
automatically adds them to your cart. Just download Honey to your computer,

27:32.480 --> 27:35.600
shop like normal, click the apply coupons button,

27:35.600 --> 27:40.320
and watch the prices drop. It's 100% free, unlike the movie Honey.

27:40.320 --> 27:43.520
I don't know, maybe it's streaming somewhere. Can you check real quick why

27:43.520 --> 27:46.560
I finished this, Justin? Yeah, sure. I don't want to have to pay to rent

27:46.560 --> 27:49.600
Honey. I mean, at that point, I'd just own it, you know what I mean? Because I'll

27:49.600 --> 27:53.440
watch it enough that would justify buying it,

27:53.440 --> 27:57.520
you know what I mean? Because $3.99 to watch it once or like $12.99 to watch

27:57.520 --> 28:00.800
it whenever I want, it's hard to choose. I've got Honey on

28:00.800 --> 28:06.000
layaway at my local movie store that I've been paying

28:06.000 --> 28:08.640
off for. I'm nearly out of the woods on that one.

28:08.640 --> 28:12.480
You could get it. The juice is running is the problem.

28:12.480 --> 28:16.240
It's $4 on YouTube. Move on. Okay.

28:16.240 --> 28:20.560
Honey, the website is 100% free to use and installs in just a few seconds.

28:20.560 --> 28:26.320
So get Honey, the website, for free at joinhoney.com. It's not a website.

28:26.320 --> 28:30.080
It's a browser extension. The browser extension, not the movie.

28:30.080 --> 28:32.960
I just want to make sure people don't think I'm talking about the movie now.

28:32.960 --> 28:38.560
At joinhoney.com slash brother. That's joinhoney.com slash brother.

28:38.560 --> 28:42.320
And that is to use the browser extension Honey, not to be

28:42.320 --> 28:45.520
in the movie Honey. I just want to make sure that's clear because I've talked a

28:45.520 --> 28:48.720
lot about both in the last couple minutes. If you want to

28:48.720 --> 28:53.200
be in the movie Honey, I'm gonna give you a Bitcoin address

28:53.200 --> 28:57.520
that you will send Bitcoins to and then they will figure out the rest. They will

28:57.520 --> 29:01.440
need a very high-res JPEG of your face in a well-lit environment.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.880
Hey, if you enjoy all these great jokes about Honey that we've been doing

29:04.880 --> 29:07.600
and all the other shows on the MaxFun Network have been doing because we

29:07.600 --> 29:12.240
coordinated it. It's Honey Week, baby. Guess what? MaxFun's running a survey to

29:12.240 --> 29:15.520
help figure out which advertisers are a good fit for our audience.

29:15.520 --> 29:18.640
We are still a, you know, primarily an audience-supported

29:18.640 --> 29:22.160
endeavor and that'll always be the case but advertising can be a very helpful

29:22.160 --> 29:25.680
source of income, especially right now. And the results

29:25.680 --> 29:28.960
of the survey will help us talk to some new advertisers and convince them to

29:28.960 --> 29:32.400
give us a shot because Honey's almost certainly going to pull out after this

29:32.400 --> 29:34.560
one. The survey's short, shouldn't take any

29:34.560 --> 29:38.960
more than 10 minutes. But Jessica Alba might come in. Might come in, might swoop in

29:38.960 --> 29:41.840
there. And it's doing us a big favor. This is

29:41.840 --> 29:44.480
a short survey. It shouldn't take any more than 10 minutes and

29:44.480 --> 29:48.400
we sure would appreciate it. Just go to MaximumFun.org

29:48.400 --> 29:54.240
slash ad survey to fill it out and do it now and you find out which Harry

29:54.240 --> 29:58.400
Potter house you belong to also. Yep. You do it. I'm a

29:58.400 --> 30:00.880
Huffleclaw. That is going to do it for this

30:00.880 --> 30:05.200
interruption. This brief interruption. This brief Honey-centric interruption.

30:05.200 --> 30:09.520
Have you guys seen that? I've never seen the movie. Let's head back to the show.

30:09.520 --> 30:15.120
Video games. Video games. Video games. You like them? Maybe you wish you had more

30:15.120 --> 30:18.080
time for them. Maybe you want to know the best ones to play. Maybe you want to know

30:18.080 --> 30:21.600
what happens to Mario when he dies. In that case, you should check out

30:21.600 --> 30:26.080
TripleClick. It's a brand new podcast about video games. A podcast about video

30:26.080 --> 30:28.880
games? But I don't have time for that. Sure you do.

30:28.880 --> 30:32.000
Once a week, kick back as three video game experts give you everything from

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
critical takes on the hottest new releases,

30:34.000 --> 30:37.440
to scoops, interviews, and explanations about how video games work,

30:37.440 --> 30:41.360
to fascinating and sometimes weird stories about the games we love.

30:41.360 --> 30:45.520
TripleClick is hosted by me, Kirk Hamilton. Me, Jason Schreier. And me,

30:45.520 --> 30:49.120
Maddie Myers. You can find TripleClick wherever you get your podcasts and listen

30:49.120 --> 30:52.960
at MaximumFun.org. Bye!

30:52.960 --> 30:57.680
Here's a yahoo that was sent in by Adrienne Cowles. Thank you, Adrienne.

30:57.680 --> 31:00.800
Sometimes if you've never watched our show or listened to it,

31:00.800 --> 31:03.920
if you've watched our- if you've never listened to our show but you watched our

31:03.920 --> 31:07.520
short-lived CSO production, you don't exist. If you're one of the many people who never

31:07.520 --> 31:12.000
watched our TV show. Okay, Adrienne Cowles sent this in. It is

31:12.000 --> 31:15.520
by Blue Fox Socks who asks,

31:15.520 --> 31:21.440
do pizza chefs ever hate their creations?

31:21.600 --> 31:24.960
What an oddly specific question. Say a pizza chef

31:24.960 --> 31:28.960
really hated putting pineapple on pizza. Would they be ashamed of making that

31:28.960 --> 31:32.480
pizza if it was ordered? Would they even have pineapple on the menu?

31:32.480 --> 31:37.040
Or would they suck it up? Well, rarely does a- okay, if we're

31:37.040 --> 31:41.360
talking about like, uh, say, uh, Little Caesars. Yeah.

31:41.360 --> 31:46.880
The pizza chef at Little Caesars does not own Little Caesars. Okay, that's fair,

31:46.880 --> 31:50.400
Travis, but I would argue the pizza chef at Little Caesars hates

31:50.400 --> 31:55.120
every pizza that they're sending out. That's the thing is, you bring up the

31:55.120 --> 31:58.960
idea of like, I had to put a combination of these that I didn't like, as opposed

31:58.960 --> 32:01.280
to just the chef finishing the pizza going,

32:01.280 --> 32:05.360
I fucked that up. Yeah, but I'm stuck on Little Caesars, Travis, because in your

32:05.360 --> 32:07.760
mindscape, I want to undercover boss a Little

32:07.760 --> 32:10.640
Caesars with you, because you imagine there will be at least

32:10.640 --> 32:16.000
one of these franchises where you dip into the back room and see somebody like

32:18.480 --> 32:22.000
I'm going to work hard on this and get sweaty and sell it for

32:22.000 --> 32:28.160
five dollars. I have to believe that of all the Little

32:28.160 --> 32:32.400
Caesars across this great planet of ours, in Little

32:32.400 --> 32:38.240
Caesars in, say, America, Canada, Italy,

32:38.240 --> 32:43.440
that there is one chef who's like, another masterpiece.

32:43.440 --> 32:47.360
This question does... I'm so glad I went to the cordon bleu.

32:47.360 --> 32:51.920
This, uh, this, uh, why did they name the cordon bleu after chicken cordon

32:51.920 --> 32:54.960
bleu? That's confusing. It's confusing as all get out. They

32:54.960 --> 32:58.880
teach you to make other things there. Did you know that? Anyway, everything that

32:58.880 --> 33:02.880
actually comes out of there is, hamburger, cordon bleu, only the chicken

33:02.880 --> 33:05.120
stuck. This question does raise an

33:05.120 --> 33:08.240
interesting sort of moral quandary, and that is to say,

33:08.240 --> 33:14.480
if a chef gets an order for an immoral pizza and they still,

33:14.480 --> 33:17.760
like, I'm saying specifically something with perhaps pineapples

33:17.760 --> 33:20.800
or cheese and pineapple, Canadian bacon,

33:20.800 --> 33:25.040
Canadian bacon, which is ham, we all know that, if they get an order for an

33:25.040 --> 33:28.000
immoral pizza and they make it, they're complicit, right?

33:28.000 --> 33:31.040
They should walk, they should, they carry some of that stain,

33:31.040 --> 33:36.080
perhaps literally. Yes. What if someone says, uh, just hold the cheese,

33:36.080 --> 33:42.480
hold the pepperoni, add sauce and jalapenos, and hold the crust.

33:42.480 --> 33:45.840
So you're envisioning the chef sort of holding all these things.

33:45.840 --> 33:49.440
And it was just a box of sauce and jalapenos.

33:49.440 --> 33:53.680
I would love a five dollar, hot and ready, just come breathe in my face a little

33:53.680 --> 33:56.560
bit. Yeah. What if, what if someone said with

33:56.560 --> 34:00.160
extra arsenic? What the chef would say? Oh, Trav, this is a

34:00.160 --> 34:04.880
good start of a riddle, dude. Yeah, is that murder? Can the cop, the cop

34:04.880 --> 34:07.760
would be like, that's a murder you did, and then you'd be

34:07.760 --> 34:11.680
like, he asked for arsenic, then what?

34:11.680 --> 34:16.000
And he stood on a block of ice. Yes.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.280
While grocery shopping recently, I gave in to temptation and threw a box of

34:19.280 --> 34:24.000
chocolate peanut butter pie Oreos in my cart. What, can you say those words again?

34:24.000 --> 34:27.600
Hey, let the, let the wiki show, I said all those words right on the first try.

34:27.600 --> 34:31.680
Good job. Yes, but they were all, they were all very confusing ideas. A box of

34:31.680 --> 34:34.800
chocolate peanut butter pie Oreos in my cart. Two aisles later,

34:34.800 --> 34:38.640
I shed the rest of my dignity and ripped open the packaging. Then, anytime I was

34:38.640 --> 34:42.880
alone in an aisle, I would pop one in my mouth. I made it to the checkout

34:42.880 --> 34:44.960
line, and when the teenage cashier got to the

34:44.960 --> 34:48.800
open package of Oreos, they exclaimed, wow, you must have been hungry.

34:48.800 --> 34:52.240
Before I could finish paying, they commented. If a human being said those

34:52.240 --> 34:55.920
words to me, I'd melt into a puddle. Yeah. Before I could

34:55.920 --> 34:59.680
finish paying, they then commented that their dad would have never

34:59.680 --> 35:03.040
opened snacks in the store, and I must be a cool dad.

35:03.040 --> 35:07.440
I am a childless 25-year-old man.

35:07.840 --> 35:11.600
How do I atone for my voyeuristic Oreo eating behaviors, or have I been

35:11.600 --> 35:15.200
punished enough? Okay, first of all, it's

35:15.200 --> 35:19.920
exhibitionist Oreo eating behaviors. Yes. You weren't watching other people eat

35:19.920 --> 35:23.280
Oreos, so let's get that. Although, I bet you're

35:23.280 --> 35:26.880
just a few keystrokes away on youtube.com

35:26.880 --> 35:32.080
from enjoying that very specific kink. I would argue that the person who

35:32.080 --> 35:35.600
commented, my dad would never let me do that, you must be a cool dad.

35:35.600 --> 35:39.200
Maybe that moment has nothing to do with you whatsoever. Yeah, I think they were

35:39.200 --> 35:41.360
just wanting to share a little bit about their dad.

35:41.360 --> 35:44.880
Is the boat moving the table, or are we just leaning

35:44.880 --> 35:49.280
hard? Yeah, I'm leaning both. I want every inch of this show. Maybe the rest of that sentence was,

35:49.280 --> 35:54.000
and will you be my dad and watch me eat Oreos?

35:54.000 --> 35:58.400
I am confused by a strange part of this question.

35:58.400 --> 36:05.280
Okay. Of seeing somebody at the store eating Oreos and saying, boy, you must

36:05.280 --> 36:09.760
have been hungry, as if Oreos is something you eat

36:09.760 --> 36:16.560
to satisfy a powerful hunger. Okay, all right, okay,

36:16.560 --> 36:19.360
did you want them to just start gnawing on some

36:19.360 --> 36:22.720
like dry fettuccine? Like, what do you want?

36:22.720 --> 36:26.320
Did you want them to, not specifically targeted at you, I'm sorry, I could pick

36:26.320 --> 36:30.640
anything, but like... Nobody's ever been like,

36:30.640 --> 36:33.680
it's dinner time,

36:33.680 --> 36:38.080
I have a hamburger here, I also, ooh, these Oreos would

36:38.080 --> 36:42.000
fill me right up. Okay, hold on, stop, no, wait, they're at the grocery store,

36:42.000 --> 36:45.840
they don't have a hamburger here. What I, let me frame this better.

36:45.840 --> 36:49.440
If I was this cashier and somebody came through and

36:49.440 --> 36:54.720
had an open thing of Oreos, my response would be,

36:54.720 --> 36:58.160
wow, Oreos sure taste good, huh? It would not be,

36:58.160 --> 37:02.880
boy, those will fill you right up like food does at a meal.

37:02.880 --> 37:06.000
Yeah, but you wouldn't, yeah, you wouldn't say anything.

37:06.000 --> 37:10.160
If you watched someone eat 10 Oreos, you wouldn't assume,

37:10.160 --> 37:15.120
I bet they weren't hungry. That's a wild thing to say though. Because I'm pretty

37:15.120 --> 37:18.640
sure in the question it said, an empty pack of Oreos. You can have a

37:18.640 --> 37:22.000
hunger for lots of things, and sometimes you have a hunger for Oreos.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.400
I'm sure they would have loved to have a nice sit-down meal with some grilled

37:24.400 --> 37:28.320
asparagus. Yeah, and a... Does anybody understand the point I'm

37:28.320 --> 37:32.240
trying to make, or am I? No, I, listen, I understand what you're

37:32.240 --> 37:34.560
saying, but I think what you were ignoring is, I am a

37:34.560 --> 37:37.600
human being in the world, who exists in society,

37:37.600 --> 37:42.400
if I saw anybody eat anything, even if it was asparagus and steak or whatever, I

37:42.400 --> 37:45.440
wouldn't say, you must be hungry, because that person's

37:45.440 --> 37:50.560
a monster. Yeah. Like, walk, okay, tomorrow, everyone in this room,

37:50.560 --> 37:55.440
walk around the Lido Market tomorrow. Hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry. You must be hungry.

37:55.440 --> 38:00.480
Because the answer is always, yeah. Yeah, for sure. And here's a sneak peek,

38:00.480 --> 38:04.160
I'm gonna be hungry again in six hours. Catch me then,

38:04.160 --> 38:07.840
for a new meal called dinner. I'll be there.

38:07.840 --> 38:11.200
I think the better, what they should have said is, oh, someone wants to be

38:11.200 --> 38:15.520
shoplifting. Oh, someone's doing a bit of tummy

38:15.520 --> 38:18.560
smuggling. So you don't sell these Oreos by weight.

38:18.560 --> 38:23.600
Okay, I'll take my business and my Oreos elsewhere.

38:24.240 --> 38:27.760
Hi, I don't think I want to buy these Oreos. I tried 10 of them, and I don't

38:27.760 --> 38:30.960
like them. I thought they were regular, but they

38:30.960 --> 38:34.480
taste like peanut butter. They taste too much, there's too much peanut butter and

38:34.480 --> 38:37.040
too much chocolate. It's just overall too flavorful.

38:37.040 --> 38:41.040
I want my money back. I didn't buy them, my mistake.

38:41.040 --> 38:46.080
Goodbye, you'll never see me again. Oh no, I brought these Oreos from home.

38:46.080 --> 38:50.000
I need to, don't get freaked out if I run as fast as I can

38:50.000 --> 38:53.760
out of the store. It's part of my exercise I do. I left my money in the

38:53.760 --> 38:56.240
car.

38:57.040 --> 39:00.640
Hey, here's a Yahoo that was sent in by approximately

39:00.640 --> 39:05.360
every living human being on the planet. It's asked by an anonymous Yahoo answers

39:05.360 --> 39:15.520
user who I'm going to call Jambus. Jambus asks,

39:15.520 --> 39:18.880
horse funeral supplies?

39:20.080 --> 39:26.000
Where can I buy horse funeral supplies? Big box store.

39:26.000 --> 39:34.320
We did it. America, we did it.

39:34.320 --> 39:37.840
There's only three people that have stood up to leave the room. No,

39:37.840 --> 39:44.480
four. Okay, bye. Still a good job. Catch the rest of it. Yeah, we usually turn the

39:44.480 --> 39:49.600
house lights off so we don't get real-time data. But this is good.

39:49.600 --> 39:54.880
This is theater of the mind. No, Travis, it is not. This is theater of

39:54.880 --> 40:00.640
the watching the analytics as they happen. We can pretend the

40:00.640 --> 40:05.440
balcony is ride or die. It's all full. It's done.

40:05.440 --> 40:10.720
See, a big... To be fair, it's not like the ship was sold out.

40:10.720 --> 40:16.800
Oh, no. Hey, so like a big box store. I should explain it. Yeah. Anyway, a

40:16.800 --> 40:21.200
big box store, but also a big box is like for a

40:21.200 --> 40:25.360
horse's coffin. Yeah. Imagine a horse has died. You didn't

40:25.360 --> 40:29.360
care about it personally. How do I get my co-workers to compliment

40:29.360 --> 40:32.240
me on my leftovers? One of my co-workers often gets

40:32.240 --> 40:34.480
compliments on the leftovers he brings for lunch like,

40:34.480 --> 40:37.840
ooh, that looks good and that smells nice.

40:37.840 --> 40:41.760
Whereas, you know, compliments. You know, compliments. Ooh, food. Whereas, I get

40:41.760 --> 40:44.320
none. I pride myself on being a good cook and

40:44.320 --> 40:47.920
I'd like some validation from my peers. How do I make my famous chili look as

40:47.920 --> 40:50.720
delicious as it tastes? Doesn't sound like it's very famous,

40:50.720 --> 40:54.800
this chili. And it doesn't seem about looks. Who is ever... Like, it's mostly

40:54.800 --> 40:57.520
about smell, right? Smell, yeah. Because no

40:57.520 --> 41:00.560
matter how good it looks, if you're like, oh, that's a good looking dish,

41:00.560 --> 41:04.800
it smells like shit. Yeah, especially chili. All chili more or less looks the

41:04.800 --> 41:08.800
same. I need to huff it to know. That looks like a mistake you made by

41:08.800 --> 41:11.280
blending ingredients together. Oh, a beans mistake.

41:11.280 --> 41:14.640
Let me huff it. That's good. It might also be...

41:14.640 --> 41:17.600
There's a possibility that your co-worker's food is

41:17.600 --> 41:20.880
so bad that the other co-workers are saying,

41:20.880 --> 41:24.320
that looks great. Oh, it's reaction formation. Yeah, you say the opposite of...

41:24.320 --> 41:31.040
Yeah, that makes sense. Oh, good job. Might I suggest a little garnish? Just a little green.

41:31.040 --> 41:34.320
A little bit of green. And thus, receive him king.

41:34.320 --> 41:38.160
Just a little bit of garnish on there can relate. Maybe some

41:38.160 --> 41:43.760
scallions? Or... Like fresh scallions from your office box?

41:43.760 --> 41:47.920
From your desk drawer? If you saw someone pull out

41:47.920 --> 41:51.040
a container of Tupperware chili and taped to it

41:51.040 --> 41:56.960
was a small envelope of scallions, that is something you would comment on.

41:56.960 --> 42:00.400
That person needs you to compliment their chili.

42:00.400 --> 42:03.920
It's extremely important. And they just start narrating

42:03.920 --> 42:08.560
in the moment, like, and I'm just gonna microwave this at three minutes on high.

42:08.560 --> 42:12.240
Oh, a little bit of sour cream on there. Cut up scallions. Voila!

42:12.240 --> 42:17.760
I did it. It doesn't look good. It's chili. Yeah. No one's ever gonna

42:17.760 --> 42:22.080
look at your stinky bean soup and say, hmm, looks good. There's a thousand

42:22.080 --> 42:24.720
recipes for chili. You know what that means? Chili is a food

42:24.720 --> 42:28.400
that you cook by, I don't know, it's just what I had. I put it all in a bowl and

42:28.400 --> 42:31.280
cooked it for a long time and now it's chili, I suppose.

42:31.280 --> 42:34.320
No one's ever gonna say, hmm, looks good. They're gonna say, looks like you had

42:34.320 --> 42:38.480
those ingredients handy. Is it? There is a moment in every chili

42:38.480 --> 42:40.800
cook's life where they said, I think this is chili.

42:40.800 --> 42:44.080
Yeah, I think I did chili. Is it possible that maybe we could glow

42:44.080 --> 42:48.240
up the container that the chili is brought into the building? Maybe it's

42:48.240 --> 42:51.040
just a, maybe it's a sight lines thing, right? You

42:51.040 --> 42:55.920
carry a bowl of chili into a building. Who the fuck are you? What is that? That's

42:55.920 --> 43:01.040
a bowl of chili. Get it out of my sight. A red wagon

43:01.040 --> 43:06.400
full of chili. A radio flyer wagon. Full of chili. Full of chili. How have

43:06.400 --> 43:10.080
you protected the radio flyer? Uh, yeah, good question,

43:10.080 --> 43:13.520
Justin. How have we protected and captured the smell inside of the wagon?

43:13.520 --> 43:17.680
You stupid idiot. No, I'm just saying, I feel like if you

43:17.680 --> 43:20.640
tried to dump a bunch of chili into a wagon, it would fall right out.

43:20.640 --> 43:24.960
All right. Open your mind, Justin. I'm asking you to open your mind. It's thick

43:24.960 --> 43:29.680
chili. It's thick chili and there's no chili. It's solid chili. It's frozen in a

43:29.680 --> 43:32.160
block. There's no chili thick enough to not

43:32.160 --> 43:37.040
slip between the cracks in a red rider wagon. Thank you for asking.

43:37.040 --> 43:40.160
My chili. It's Griffin's problem to solve. You don't have to help him.

43:40.160 --> 43:43.840
It was Griffin's bad idea. You don't have to fix this. But I'm going to shark tank it.

43:43.840 --> 43:49.680
Griffin, how do you keep the chili in the wagon? You're right. I'm sorry.

43:50.400 --> 43:55.360
What if you carry it into the office one handful at a time?

43:55.360 --> 44:01.680
Dump it right on your desk. Leave. Dump more. Next handful. This will take all day.

44:01.680 --> 44:03.840
You will not be paid for your work on this day.

44:03.840 --> 44:10.640
Oh. Maybe if you wrote on the package, Nana's last chili.

44:10.640 --> 44:13.840
But then you kept bringing it in every Friday.

44:13.840 --> 44:16.960
Yeah. To a point where they're like, should we still be having it?

44:16.960 --> 44:20.000
Eventually someone will call you on it and be like, no, no, no. It's a chili

44:20.000 --> 44:22.560
starter.

44:24.880 --> 44:28.240
You call yourself a chef.

44:28.240 --> 44:34.080
This question comes to us from someone here on your team.

44:34.080 --> 44:37.840
The short version is their mom sends them

44:37.840 --> 44:42.000
a lot of things in the mail. So she sends me cutouts from magazines,

44:42.000 --> 44:45.360
old bottles, junk mail from my high school.

44:45.360 --> 44:49.680
I'm 33 and haven't been back to high school since 2006.

44:49.680 --> 44:54.240
That's true of most people. Yeah, it would be weird to go back to your high school.

44:54.240 --> 44:57.280
A lot of people don't go back and they're like, you know what? Let me try math

44:57.280 --> 45:01.120
again. I'm gonna do math again. Unless you're dreaming, that does

45:01.120 --> 45:04.320
happen to me a lot. Sometimes it's even things that she found around the house

45:04.320 --> 45:08.160
that just made her quote, think of me. And she always puts a little

45:08.160 --> 45:13.760
note in the box or letter that says, just look at it and then throw it away.

45:13.760 --> 45:17.200
I've asked her to stop sending me what is essentially trash,

45:17.200 --> 45:20.720
but she won't. Brothers, how do I keep my mom to stop

45:20.720 --> 45:24.800
turning my mailbox into a garbage can? That's from trying to keep it clean.

45:24.800 --> 45:29.200
Kelly, Kelly are you here? Your mom thinks you're garbage.

45:29.200 --> 45:33.200
Your mom is burning you left and right.

45:33.200 --> 45:37.280
I saw this garbage and thought of you.

45:38.480 --> 45:43.680
Go back to high school. It's nice that you do have a permission slip to not

45:43.680 --> 45:46.800
care about something that your parents have sent you is always

45:46.800 --> 45:52.000
a real relief. That would be nice if dad when he texts me like, hey do you remember

45:52.000 --> 45:55.760
Jim Johnson? He died. If the rest of that text was,

45:55.760 --> 45:59.520
and I don't expect you to care about it at all.

45:59.520 --> 46:05.840
Your dentist's uncle died, but it's fine. It's fine. Ignore this. But hey,

46:05.840 --> 46:10.880
it's chill. Keep doing what you're doing. I realized that you had no personal

46:10.880 --> 46:15.440
attachment to it whatsoever. I just needed to use up some minutes I

46:15.440 --> 46:20.080
had on my phone. This is a test and if you've actually

46:20.080 --> 46:23.760
been throwing these things away, I regret to inform you you have been

46:23.760 --> 46:28.000
failing the test catastrophically. She's gonna come to your house and be like

46:28.000 --> 46:32.880
where's the bottle? Oh. Just, she may not even say anything. You will just see her

46:32.880 --> 46:38.240
looking around. No, it is for a scrapbook of some sort.

46:38.240 --> 46:42.480
I would throw it in the trash without opening it because that way there's no

46:42.480 --> 46:45.600
guilt. It's kind of a Schrodinger's trash situation.

46:45.600 --> 46:48.800
Maybe it was good, maybe it was bad. You'll live with the mystery and you

46:48.800 --> 46:53.040
won't live with the trash. Unless. But what if? Unless. Unless.

46:53.040 --> 46:57.520
Unless. Oh is it mine? I said but it and that's nothing.

46:57.520 --> 47:03.040
No, unless it is possible. Does your mom ever send you like just $100 bills

47:03.040 --> 47:05.680
because they don't do Justin's thing. I was going to say

47:05.680 --> 47:09.440
a check. There was a story that we heard in church

47:09.440 --> 47:13.760
literally monthly about someone getting a Bible as a gift for graduation

47:13.760 --> 47:16.560
and then throwing it away and they left a hot check for a hundred dollars in the

47:16.560 --> 47:19.920
Bible. Like literally, monthly we're hearing

47:19.920 --> 47:22.960
this story like don't throw away the Bibles that your dad gets you.

47:22.960 --> 47:25.920
Don't throw away any Bible. It could have a check for a hundred dollars in it.

47:25.920 --> 47:28.960
What's great about that is that literally the pastor is saying

47:28.960 --> 47:34.240
normally it's worthless but maybe there is secret money in it.

47:34.240 --> 47:38.560
Which way you look like a dick. Yeah, I probably look like a real

47:38.560 --> 47:42.400
goober at every hotel that I went to that had a Gideon's in the jar.

47:42.400 --> 47:46.960
The Mormons love Gideon's. You had a very straightforward national

47:46.960 --> 47:50.400
treasure experience. Flip, flip, flip, adventure over.

47:50.400 --> 47:53.760
All that lesson I taught you is look in the Bible

47:53.760 --> 47:57.280
before you throw it away. Hello, I'd like to be moved.

47:57.280 --> 48:01.680
Hotel rooms please. 16 times if possible. I have very

48:01.680 --> 48:08.000
exacting standards. I'll be honest with you, I've used the Bible up.

48:08.000 --> 48:14.560
Hey, this Bible's empty. This Bible empty. Next room. Another one

48:14.560 --> 48:17.520
of these calls.

48:25.760 --> 48:34.160
I want to munch, squad. Boy, I want to munch, squad.

48:34.160 --> 48:36.800
So this is Munch Squad. It's a podcast within the podcast that profiles the

48:36.800 --> 48:40.400
latest and greatest in brand eating. Oh, Juice, you actually just did the Munch

48:40.400 --> 48:46.240
Squad with your wild salad. Hey, welcome to Justin Brand Eats.

48:46.240 --> 48:50.080
Prepare your proposal. Pepsi debuts diamond engagement ring made

48:50.080 --> 48:54.720
with crystal Pepsi. Consumers can enter to win a sustainably made ring via

48:54.720 --> 48:58.800
social media. Oh, thank God. Yeah, thank God this one crystal Pepsi

48:58.800 --> 49:04.160
ring was sustainably made. That should fix everything. Thank you, Pepsi.

49:04.160 --> 49:09.280
You fixed it all. That sweet young girl can retire now.

49:09.280 --> 49:13.280
She put her feet up, go fishing. Yeah. Pepsi fixed everything with its one

49:13.280 --> 49:16.320
sustainable crystal Pepsi diamond. For people about to pop the question,

49:16.320 --> 49:20.640
Pepsi has introduced an unusual new engagement ring. The beverage company

49:20.640 --> 49:24.960
has debuted the Pepsi engagement ring made with one big difference. This

49:24.960 --> 49:30.160
diamond is infused with crystal Pepsi. Fuck off.

49:30.160 --> 49:34.720
Just hear me out, Trav. How do you infuse a diamond with the... Oh, my God.

49:34.720 --> 49:39.120
Let me see your ring. It's got... If you think I'm not going to

49:39.120 --> 49:42.800
detail exactly how this is happening, you're wrong. Okay, let's let him

49:42.800 --> 49:47.440
get through it. Yes, this is my great-grandpa's ring.

49:47.440 --> 49:51.520
The brand is asking fans on Twitter to tweet their most creative, bold, or

49:51.520 --> 49:54.960
bizarre proposal ideas with the brand's social handle and

49:54.960 --> 50:00.800
hashtag's hashtag Pepsi proposal. Okay, so Pepsi worked with a creative

50:00.800 --> 50:04.400
agency that I will not name because they don't get the free publicity

50:04.400 --> 50:08.080
to create the ring. It says here McElroy Brothers industry. Oh, no.

50:08.080 --> 50:12.320
So, according to the brand, the ring was made by boiling down Pepsi's clear

50:12.320 --> 50:17.680
beverage to its most basic carbon form, resulting in a powder. This

50:17.680 --> 50:21.520
powder was then added to the process for creating a lab-grown diamond,

50:21.520 --> 50:25.360
which requires using a small piece of natural diamond that is placed in

50:25.360 --> 50:27.360
the carbon under high-pressure temperature.

50:27.360 --> 50:30.960
Quick aside. They figure out how to make diamonds? Because why are we making this

50:30.960 --> 50:33.920
fucking podcast? I thought only Superman could make

50:33.920 --> 50:36.320
diamonds. We could just go and make diamonds, boys.

50:36.320 --> 50:40.240
Sell them on a cruise ship, I guess. Not everything that can be made by man

50:40.240 --> 50:44.240
no longer has value. You'll see that point. No, listen to podcasts.

50:44.240 --> 50:48.960
Yeah, that's fucking true. So, okay, I could have stopped there and it would

50:48.960 --> 50:51.680
have been pretty terrible, but I thought, wait a minute, you just

50:51.680 --> 50:54.560
gave me the hashtag. So, let me get up on Twitter and see what

50:54.560 --> 50:59.360
we're doing. Let me see what's cooking. So, here's some proposal ideas that

50:59.360 --> 51:03.760
people sent to the brand Pepsi. Fluffy said, up in a hot air balloon, a

51:03.760 --> 51:06.240
daybreak.

51:06.640 --> 51:12.720
Sure, cool. That sounds good. Creative. Julie tweeted this

51:12.720 --> 51:17.280
to Pepsi. I would invite you out for a picnic,

51:17.280 --> 51:22.960
Pepsi, the brand. I'd spread the tablecloth out on the

51:22.960 --> 51:26.880
ground and reach in the picnic basket and pull out a Pepsi

51:26.880 --> 51:31.120
and then set the Pepsi engagement ring next to it and ask the question.

51:31.120 --> 51:35.680
April followed up just moments after, tweeting directly at Pepsi,

51:35.680 --> 51:42.320
I'd love to get engaged to Pepsi. Folks, you're not marrying Pepsi. Wait, hold on,

51:42.320 --> 51:45.600
Justin. Aren't they? You're not. I would get,

51:45.600 --> 51:48.480
Dennis said, I would get down, this is all caps,

51:48.480 --> 51:52.240
I would get down on my knee and propose very loud so she can hear me with my

51:52.240 --> 51:57.600
crystal Pepsi ring. Why? Because she's 300 feet away.

51:57.600 --> 52:03.920
As is legally binding. Yeah. Mikey said, well, I gotta find that love.

52:03.920 --> 52:09.680
Oh, Mikey. Oh, no. Hey, so Mikey's here tonight if anyone's...

52:09.680 --> 52:13.920
I gotta find a love who loves cherry Pepsi as much as me.

52:13.920 --> 52:18.080
Winky face? I don't think so, Mikey. Yeah, it's not a cherry, it's not a cherry

52:18.080 --> 52:20.800
Pepsi diamond. Yeah, and I don't think that winky, that's

52:20.800 --> 52:23.840
a ring pop. Go to the beach with her and hand her,

52:23.840 --> 52:27.600
while on one knee, a cherry Pepsi with this awesome ring

52:27.600 --> 52:30.560
around the straw and say, will you marry me?

52:30.560 --> 52:34.160
Hey, like, it's so weird that you got the soda wrong, Mikey, that I'm going to move

52:34.160 --> 52:36.800
on instantly. Then William burst through the

52:36.800 --> 52:39.040
door. Please permanently bring back Pepsi

52:39.040 --> 52:42.400
holiday spice as an annual tradition or rename it

52:42.400 --> 52:47.520
Pepsi Spice and keep it permanently. And then William departs. How romantic.

52:47.520 --> 52:50.960
William jumps out the window. That, no, that's how he'd propose.

52:50.960 --> 52:56.480
Uh, Liu just... I will! Liu just tweeted a still image of Medea.

52:56.480 --> 53:02.640
So I don't know, I don't know exactly what the plan is, but it's just a single

53:02.640 --> 53:08.000
still image of Medea. It's what I've been waiting for since I was a little child.

53:08.000 --> 53:12.240
Omar says, how would I do it? Hmm, probably like James Bond.

53:12.240 --> 53:17.200
Pull up in an Aston Martin. Act like someone or something is in danger.

53:17.200 --> 53:21.760
Get her into the car and drive to the beach. Then Pepsi responded to

53:21.760 --> 53:28.400
that one and said, hashtag sounds cool to us. What the fuck, Pepsi?

53:28.400 --> 53:32.000
It sounds cool for the person to drive up, pretend like someone's

53:32.000 --> 53:36.880
in danger. You know that great scene in every James Bond movie

53:36.880 --> 53:40.320
where he pulls up in a car, he's like, uh, your dog

53:40.320 --> 53:44.320
has... Imagine it like this. Griffin is my love. Screech!

53:44.320 --> 53:49.360
Someone's gonna die! Oh no, I'll get in the car with you.

53:49.360 --> 53:55.840
Anyways, I love Pepsi. Do you forever? Pepsi sounds cool to us. Kim said, I would

53:55.840 --> 54:00.240
say as I got down on one knee, you're as beautiful as the sound of opening

54:00.240 --> 54:03.440
Pepsi. You're as sweet as the taste of Pepsi,

54:03.440 --> 54:08.080
and I like Pepsi. I want you to know that I have you

54:08.080 --> 54:11.280
forever. Will you be mine forever and ever until

54:11.280 --> 54:16.000
the end of time? Sure, Kim, that sounds nice. Stephen

54:16.000 --> 54:18.640
swoops in.

54:19.200 --> 54:25.280
Traditional on one knee in place of particular interests to myself and my

54:25.280 --> 54:30.080
S.O. Crowds are unnecessary. Photography is

54:30.080 --> 54:33.280
required. And then I'd kill both of you. Yeah, hey

54:33.280 --> 54:37.360
Stephen, that sucks. Like, all of that energy that you just

54:37.360 --> 54:40.800
brought to a single tweet really stinks, and I hope that Pepsi throws this ring

54:40.800 --> 54:44.560
in the trash as a result. I hope that Pepsi passes that tweet

54:44.560 --> 54:48.080
onto the FBI. Yeah, that person should be on a watch list. I hope whoever gets

54:48.080 --> 54:54.240
proposed to with the Pepsi ring says, do you have coke?

54:54.480 --> 54:58.240
That's gonna do it for us here. My brother, my brother, and me,

54:58.240 --> 55:02.400
thank you so much for coming.

55:02.400 --> 55:09.040
Let's see, there's some, oh god, this is crass, but I'm

55:09.040 --> 55:13.280
Travis. There's merch up there. We have the

55:13.280 --> 55:16.400
Adventure Zone graphic novel. We have some

55:16.400 --> 55:20.560
Cruise inspired pins of our faces where we're in

55:20.560 --> 55:26.000
jaunty sailor caps. Yes. We're going to be doing a second

55:26.000 --> 55:30.000
shot. A lot of different things, yeah. We're doing a signing where we'll be

55:30.000 --> 55:32.640
signing the Avengers Zone or whatever the hell you want to bring.

55:32.640 --> 55:35.680
Yeah, look for it in the schedule because we don't know where it is.

55:35.680 --> 55:42.400
I've got a Disney sing-along coming up on Thursday.

55:42.400 --> 55:46.560
Hey, and thank you to everybody, thank you to Jekyll and Cruise for having us.

55:46.560 --> 55:50.080
This is the best week. And thank you to Mike and Joyelle for

55:50.080 --> 55:53.360
their opening. Oh yes, they were so good. Thanks

55:53.360 --> 55:57.040
also to John Rodgick, the long winners for their theme song, It's a Departure,

55:57.040 --> 55:58.960
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

55:58.960 --> 56:02.480
And I know what you're wondering, isn't John Roddick on this boat? Why isn't he

56:02.480 --> 56:05.280
here? He's doing the intro song for another

56:05.280 --> 56:07.200
podcast on the other end of the boat. Yeah.

56:07.200 --> 56:10.880
It's so embarrassing. If you've never heard our show,

56:10.880 --> 56:14.160
we have one ending question that Griffin reads, and it's a final Yahoo,

56:14.160 --> 56:16.800
and it's one that we think about and come back in the next episode and kind

56:16.800 --> 56:20.000
of discuss our thoughts on. Yes, a few people sent this one in. Oh, so this is

56:20.000 --> 56:24.160
fun. We'll get to talk about it in like an hour. Yeah, sure.

56:24.160 --> 56:28.880
A few people sent this one in. It's from Yahoo Answers user Big Frog who asks,

56:28.880 --> 56:35.280
who else thought Alvin, parentheses, Alvin and the Chipmunks,

56:35.280 --> 56:38.240
was an asshole?

56:38.400 --> 56:42.000
My name is Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy. This has been
