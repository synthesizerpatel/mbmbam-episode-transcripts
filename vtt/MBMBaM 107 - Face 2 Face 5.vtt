Hello Maximum Fun Convention. Ladies and gentlemen, it's 10 a.m. on a Sunday, the funny hour. The

00:13.440 --> 00:19.200
best weekend of your life is ending. You got three hours of sleep last night and you have

00:19.200 --> 00:25.740
a double hangover. Who's ready to laugh? Let's chuckle up, people. Let's do this. Chuckle

00:25.740 --> 00:32.440
up and deal. How was everybody's fancy dress party? You're just cheering. We need answers.

00:32.440 --> 00:38.520
Yeah, I need specifics. Everyone shout a detail all at once. Everyone looks so wonderful.

00:38.520 --> 00:49.920
Sexy? Did anybody get any camp strange? If not, it's not too late. We have bathrooms

00:49.920 --> 00:56.160
all over the place. It's a very open show. It's a very permissive environment. Just keep

00:56.160 --> 01:04.480
it down. Unless we stop being funny and then distract away. So we, no intimidation or anything,

01:04.480 --> 01:09.440
but we're the last thing that happens at Max Fun Con. The good news is we haven't seen

01:09.440 --> 01:20.880
anybody who's way funnier than us for the past 48 hours. But one of the things we learned

01:20.880 --> 01:24.920
from watching some of the shows we've seen, like great shows like Riff Tracks, Jordan

01:24.920 --> 01:28.920
Jessica, the stand up show last night, and Susan Lee, everybody married, usually people

01:28.920 --> 01:36.120
like buy me some time. Listen, we have a long show to get through. There's still a notepad

01:36.120 --> 01:41.480
up here that says pussy on it, by the way. Cool, cool. One of the things that we learned

01:41.480 --> 01:47.560
while we were watching some of these other shows is that preparation is so important.

01:47.560 --> 01:54.000
So I realized we should have done some. So I made, in conjunction with the boys, I made

01:54.000 --> 02:00.520
this presentation about some of the things that we should have prepared. By the way,

02:00.520 --> 02:06.400
Max is my brother, my brother and me live, face to face five, the fifth element, which

02:06.400 --> 02:11.760
is laughing. And I'm your little brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your sweet, sweet baby

02:11.760 --> 02:18.240
brother, Griffin McElroy. So presentation. First thing that I should, that we should

02:18.240 --> 02:30.480
have prepared, a PowerPoint. No one uses this at all. And you're tech savvy. Sure, sure.

02:30.480 --> 02:37.040
That's what that means. I got these with the PowerPoint Linda class that I took online.

02:37.040 --> 02:41.480
So that's thing number one, a PowerPoint. Lots of the shows had those, and we should

02:41.480 --> 02:51.400
have done one because it looked great. A second thing, breaks. This is important because this

02:51.400 --> 02:56.240
is a long show, and Jordan and Jesse left for a while. That would have been good. I

02:56.240 --> 02:58.920
had no idea we could do that. Didn't know that was an option. Yeah, did not know that

02:58.920 --> 03:02.480
was an option to do a cinematic entertainment. That's a great idea. Like 10 minutes. You

03:02.480 --> 03:07.120
want to be funny. That would be like sweet, sweet water. If somebody on your podcast,

03:07.120 --> 03:12.080
and unlikely cases, they have irritable bowels. Yeah. Unlikely case if you're on a podcast,

03:12.080 --> 03:17.240
not nobody up here. Yeah. Maybe traveling upsets your little guy. Tell me. It's actually

03:17.240 --> 03:21.660
the it's, it's the, it's the height up here on the mountain here at the fucking throat

03:21.660 --> 03:26.880
of the world. It's the, the air is really, is that the correct term? Throat of the world

03:26.880 --> 03:36.040
high schools, right? These kids are going to school in Game of Thrones. Musical interludes.

03:36.040 --> 03:42.640
This is good because people always like those. And again, it gives the people of an irritable

03:42.640 --> 03:48.120
bowel a chance to, not a lot of time, but. If Jordan and Jesse go didn't go long enough,

03:48.120 --> 03:51.520
Ashcon could have just kept repeating the chorus for like another 20 minutes and they

03:51.520 --> 03:56.960
would have been fine. I have no, we have no such padding. If any of you know any songs,

03:56.960 --> 04:01.440
you want to like hop up and don't do that. Don't do that. It's our, this is our fucking

04:01.440 --> 04:12.300
time. It's our time. Speaking of this being our fucking time, famous guests. Okay. Usually

04:12.300 --> 04:22.960
that's hard because they have to come to the place you're at. We literally could have spun

04:22.960 --> 04:29.120
around three times and gone, you. We could have put honey on our hands and caught three

04:29.120 --> 04:36.000
guests. Now here's the thing. Here's the trick though. Here's the important, important bit

04:36.000 --> 04:45.240
about this. We talked about this one. We just didn't want to share the attention. It's like

04:45.240 --> 04:50.160
to be, let's be honest, the funniest person in a room and for 48 hours you have to watch

04:50.160 --> 04:57.960
other. Thank you, ladies. A little less uproarious next time. Others know that this morning I

04:57.960 --> 05:01.920
might have accidentally when talking to Cameron Esposito referred to myself as the funniest

05:01.920 --> 05:06.640
person in the room. It's one of those things that pops out of your head and immediately

05:06.640 --> 05:11.720
go, Oh, I'm a douche. And then it's at max. You're lucky if you're the funniest person

05:11.720 --> 05:21.840
in your jacket. So we didn't want to share the attention. We also, if we fail so, so

05:21.840 --> 05:27.160
miserably, we don't want to drag anybody else down. Exactly. Speaking of failing miserably,

05:27.160 --> 05:33.840
the last thing we should have prepared is jokes. Many people had jokes written. It was

05:33.840 --> 05:40.060
like a theme. It was a theme of preparing funny things to say. So if it doesn't pan

05:40.060 --> 05:44.280
out like that, we didn't know that was part of the rules. That was not in our packet that

05:44.280 --> 05:53.160
we could prepare jokes ahead of time. So instead we're just going to do what we normally do

05:53.160 --> 06:01.560
and take your queries and turn them alchemy like into wisdom as well as answer some questions

06:01.560 --> 06:09.280
from the horrible, horrible people on the Yahoo Answers service. You guys want a Yahoo

06:09.280 --> 06:14.720
right now? Yeah. Ready? Guys, it's not to you. It's to us. No, but hey, do you want

06:14.720 --> 06:21.040
a Yahoo? This Yahoo was sent in by Steve Lewis. Thank you, Steve. It's by Yahoo Answers user

06:21.040 --> 06:34.400
Bob123. Bob4562003. Cool, cool. 2000 other two guys. Bob and then all those numbers asks,

06:34.400 --> 06:40.900
I often fantasize about my wife transforming into the She-Hulk. Is there any real way to

06:40.900 --> 06:48.520
make this happen? I had a dream about her transforming into the She-Hulk and was wondering

06:48.520 --> 06:54.840
if there is any scientific way to make her really transform into a She-Hulk or a She-Hulk

06:54.840 --> 07:04.440
like creature. It would be amazing to watch her turn green, grow huge muscles and watches

07:04.440 --> 07:13.240
her body burst through her clothes. I will pay any amount. I know a foolproof way to

07:13.240 --> 07:23.000
make that happen. Leave the toilet seat up. That's the kind of caliber of joke you get

07:23.000 --> 07:29.280
here at Maximum Fun Con. We've been prepping for this and I've done that joke three times

07:29.280 --> 07:36.400
and it has not worked any time and yet I persist. I'm like Lawrence of Arabia. I'm really glad

07:36.400 --> 07:42.720
that this gentleman, Bob, asking this question clarifies that money is no object. Yeah. That's

07:42.720 --> 07:47.760
a weird cross-section. How rare is it for somebody to be obscenely rich that money truly

07:47.760 --> 07:53.160
is no object. I'm a billionaire playboy. They also have a creepy She-Hulk finish. I just

07:53.160 --> 07:56.480
like the idea that the only thing that's been holding this back from being scientifically

07:56.480 --> 08:04.800
possible is the cost. Sure. It comes down to you're going to need your wife's consent.

08:04.800 --> 08:10.280
That's number one, guys. Don't try to push this through. It's going to take years of

08:10.280 --> 08:15.840
cross-fit training to really rip and blast. That's a very slow transformation. I think

08:15.840 --> 08:21.300
this guy is very clear about wanting her to go from 90-pound weakling to 200-pound muscle

08:21.300 --> 08:25.080
beast that can tear apart his house. You're also going to have to get her green, which

08:25.080 --> 08:29.680
is I guess paint, I guess is the best way to do that. I would assume so. I've never

08:29.680 --> 08:35.240
performed this act. This is not my... It's great though because once you get her there,

08:35.240 --> 08:42.800
you can act out your She-Hulk fantasies or your Blanca fantasies. Sure. I guess Jolly

08:42.800 --> 08:47.060
Green Giant is a... That's one. You could have her not paint her body green and then

08:47.060 --> 08:52.760
she could just be Lou Ferrigno. I'm sure there's some people who would enjoy that. He's a very

08:52.760 --> 08:59.440
nice man. Yeah. And my wife already doesn't listen. What's that mean? In the show? It's

08:59.440 --> 09:06.040
Lou Ferrigno. Oh no. Oh no. Stupid. All the best jokes you have to tell people why it's

09:06.040 --> 09:12.760
funny. There's a comedy scene. This is a wannabe comedian convention, right? There's your first

09:12.760 --> 09:19.240
lesson. The best punchlines have to be explained. Cross-ditch it somewhere. Did I put vodka

09:19.240 --> 09:24.680
in this? No. I have some actual questions that people have actually asked us. People

09:24.680 --> 09:30.360
who listen to the show, not just randos on Yahoo Answers. Don't you judge me. Oh no.

09:30.360 --> 09:37.520
Griffin's laugh. Who brought the dork? Sorry, everyone. Can someone run to the kitchen just

09:37.520 --> 09:43.280
real quick and get some... Just run to the kitchen real quick. Can anyone take off his

09:43.280 --> 09:51.920
shirt and just... Does anyone have a Swiffer wet jet? Just an old t-shirt. Have you had

09:51.920 --> 09:59.440
a mishap? I'll use the pussy paper. By which I mean the paper that says pussy on it and

09:59.440 --> 10:04.200
not something else. Just blot it up with that. I always imagine that if something goes wrong

10:04.200 --> 10:07.720
with these things, you can say it in that voice and something will happen. It's our

10:07.720 --> 10:12.120
fifth show and this is the first thing that's gone wrong. I think that's okay. Yeah. So

10:12.120 --> 10:19.440
anyway, questions from actual real people. First question. My fiance and I are getting

10:19.440 --> 10:23.680
married on September 1st and we're having a bit of dilemma on our hands. We want a kid's

10:23.680 --> 10:28.420
free wedding, but we don't know how to nicely tell family members to leave their youngsters

10:28.420 --> 10:33.640
at home. We don't want to beat around the bush or be blunt. The last thing we want is...

10:33.640 --> 10:38.600
Okay. The last thing we want... That means contrary thing. The last thing we want is

10:38.600 --> 10:42.840
for a bunch of children to show up because we were too vague. Whether this is accomplished

10:42.840 --> 10:48.920
by indication on our invitations or through another method, I leave it in your hands.

10:48.920 --> 10:52.560
Chris from Burlington. Quick note, I have made it very clear you should leave nothing

10:52.560 --> 10:56.680
in our hands. That's a bad place to leave a thing. Yeah. We have those big clumsy like

10:56.680 --> 11:04.960
linny hands and we'll just pet it to death. Thanks, Demetri. Demetri got that, everyone.

11:04.960 --> 11:12.160
It's from a book, you guys. I thought you guys were nerds. So here's thing one, clown

11:12.160 --> 11:16.680
at the door, I think is going to be... Just put station a clown right there. No kid's

11:16.680 --> 11:19.680
going to come through that threshold. You kidding me? But then you're going to need

11:19.680 --> 11:24.000
an extra storage facility to scare the frightened children. Oh yeah. Like a corral, you mean?

11:24.000 --> 11:32.440
Yeah, yeah. Something the clown can drive them into. Yeah. Yeah. Move along. Move along,

11:32.440 --> 11:42.280
Skyler. That's a kid's name, right, Skyler? Jesus. Jesus. Help us, Jesus. Is it possible,

11:42.280 --> 11:48.000
could you maybe put on the wedding invitation, the normal stuff, Max and Susie are getting

11:48.000 --> 11:51.440
married this Sunday at the church. It's going to be real cool. I hope they have more notice

11:51.440 --> 11:58.520
than this Sunday. Sunday, Sunday, Sunday. Max and Lindsey are going to holy matrimony.

11:58.520 --> 12:02.880
It's pretty last minute, but we don't really like each other all that much. But on the

12:02.880 --> 12:08.040
invitation, can you also include, we'll have fish or chicken if you want that, and it's

12:08.040 --> 12:14.680
going to be real beautiful. And also we both just found out we're sterile. Wait a minute.

12:14.680 --> 12:17.800
And if you bring your kids, it's going to be a constant reminder as you walk down the

12:17.800 --> 12:23.120
aisle. Why would you think they would mention that they're sterile if not for a goof? Right.

12:23.120 --> 12:25.720
So they're mentioning it so that everyone else will feel really bad about bringing their

12:25.720 --> 12:28.160
children. About bringing their children. That's correct. But thank you for joining us at our

12:28.160 --> 12:35.000
day of holy matrimony. Yeah. Right. We're glad you could be here. What is the problem?

12:35.000 --> 12:39.040
What do kids do? Is it they spill pudding? Is that the problem? That's it. We're going

12:39.040 --> 12:42.280
to have a giant pudding fountain at our wedding, and we're really worried about these kids

12:42.280 --> 12:46.120
getting into it. Although I don't think a kid could take the reality of a chocolate

12:46.120 --> 12:49.760
fountain, which is very popular at weddings now. If you say a kid, show a kid like, it's

12:49.760 --> 13:03.840
infinite. Maybe that's it. Just let them melt down at the door. Get some smelling salts.

13:03.840 --> 13:11.520
Would this necessitate the adoption of a flower man? Just like walking down the aisle like,

13:11.520 --> 13:23.000
hey, what's up? Petals. Petals. Or unless you can build a Vicky. Build a small wonder

13:23.000 --> 13:31.880
Vicky to be your flower girl. Topical. We're hitting all the big pop culture hits. Oh man.

13:31.880 --> 13:35.560
Next up, Turner and Hooch. Don't miss those goofs.

13:35.560 --> 13:39.840
Here's a Yahoo answer. It's sent in by Christian Vezina. Thank you, Christian. It's by Yahoo

13:39.840 --> 13:49.320
answers user Ross, who asks, getting my dog medical marijuana. Help. Stick with it. It

13:49.320 --> 13:55.400
starts off kind of sad, but okay. Okay. My dog has a sore and it won't heal. My dog may

13:55.400 --> 14:03.840
have cancer. I looked up dog sores, not healing, and that is a sign of cancer. All right. Still

14:03.840 --> 14:09.680
going. I need to get my dog THC to help fight off the possible cancer and help with the

14:09.680 --> 14:16.160
pain from the sore. I am on probation, so I can't fail my drug test. The weed is strictly

14:16.160 --> 14:22.660
for my dog. It will be her first time. Should I buy swag or some good weed? I don't know

14:22.660 --> 14:27.240
if I should get her super stoned being her first time. And that's from teach the dog

14:27.240 --> 14:32.800
to smoke. Can I take a quick medical timeout before we get too deep into this? I'm just

14:32.800 --> 14:37.320
going to ask my wife, Sydney, do you smoke people with cancer? You smoke weed. Are they

14:37.320 --> 14:46.000
sitting at the party? Are you good? Um, is it because it has cancer fighting agents or

14:46.000 --> 14:54.840
is it to distract from the fact you have cancer? Shit. Really? What? Okay. So the guy is confused

14:54.840 --> 14:59.960
about dogs don't know anything. They don't have to be distracted from the depression.

14:59.960 --> 15:03.840
One day they go to sleep. Nevermind. I'm not gonna talk about, I'm not going to talk about

15:03.840 --> 15:13.120
dogs dying this show. Tune in next week. The thorniness of this situation, uh, is that

15:13.120 --> 15:17.480
first of all, it's, it's totally contrived. You're obviously, you're obviously trying

15:17.480 --> 15:23.160
to get some weed for yourself in a very perplexingly roundabout way. No, I would like to be at that

15:23.160 --> 15:29.680
probation hearing. Listen, it's secondhand. My dog has cancer. You asshole. I was getting

15:29.680 --> 15:34.160
my dog wicked high. Who feels bad now? He doesn't have thumbs. He can't hold the bong

15:34.160 --> 15:41.400
and the hot dogs. That's the problem. That's just it though. The dog, if you can't fail

15:41.400 --> 15:46.000
your drug test, you're going to have to teach the dog how to smoke weed and teach them how

15:46.000 --> 15:51.640
to hold it together. You're going to have to teach the dog to smoke weed in another

15:51.640 --> 15:58.040
room by itself so that you don't get the sweet, sweet wafting. Listen, my nanny can't work

15:58.040 --> 16:04.640
a DVD player. How's my dog supposed to start fear and loving in Las Vegas? I love that.

16:04.640 --> 16:09.640
I love the mental image of like your dog becoming like a shitty college roommate, like hangs

16:09.640 --> 16:12.840
out and smokes weed in his room all day. Like, Hey man, you want some? Like, you know I'm

16:12.840 --> 16:18.200
on probation. If you want to listen to some Incubus, it's going to be real cool. You know

16:18.200 --> 16:23.720
I'm on probation. I can't listen to Incubus. Is that a weed band? Incubus? Is it still

16:23.720 --> 16:31.440
a band? Wow. Not a lot of Incubus fans. Maybe the wrong demographic here. I want to take

16:31.440 --> 16:39.720
everybody inside the joke for a second. I just, I just, I was up here and I decided

16:39.720 --> 16:45.280
to make that joke about fear and loathing in Las Vegas and I had a good 10 or 15 second

16:45.280 --> 16:48.720
panic attack where I was thinking to myself, please don't say the one where Nick Cage

16:48.720 --> 16:51.780
drinks himself to death and please don't say the one where Nick Cage jumps out of an airplane

16:51.780 --> 16:58.120
dressed as Elvis. Please say the right movie that has Vegas in it. So I'm glad it panned

16:58.120 --> 17:04.760
out and if it, if that was wrong, please don't tell me. I'll never realize it. It was right

17:04.760 --> 17:09.840
by the way. It was a good thing. You did a good goof. Thanks. That was the best goof.

17:09.840 --> 17:14.360
It was a BTR goof, but at least I didn't. No, that was like A plus. Why are we drinking

17:14.360 --> 17:23.360
screwdrivers? I mean, I'm very appreciative for the screwdrivers because it gives daddy

17:23.360 --> 17:29.160
his courage, but I already have so much acid in my stomach from the past 48 hours. I think

17:29.160 --> 17:35.520
the thing is we're gonna, we're gonna go mimosas and we didn't have the prep to get it together.

17:35.520 --> 17:43.600
We were too lazy to make mimosas. We got an open stove. Liza Minnelli makes mimosas and

17:43.600 --> 17:47.080
we can't be bothered. She's still out there. And she's fucking lazy? What are you saying

17:47.080 --> 17:50.880
about Liza Minnelli? No, she's a hell of a performer. You should, and you should see

17:50.880 --> 18:01.560
those gams. Fuck you. Listen, day in, day out at the Palms Casino. She's doing a show

18:01.560 --> 18:06.120
there and it is, she does all the hits. She even does a touching tribute to her mom. There's

18:06.120 --> 18:15.280
a hologram of Judy Garland. There's some weird phenomena of laughter happening. It's a big

18:15.280 --> 18:20.920
hologram audience. It makes perfect sense. Guys, real quick, I want to talk about Comedy

18:20.920 --> 18:26.200
Bang Bang. It's a new TV show that starts this Friday at 10, 9 central on IFC. It's a half

18:26.200 --> 18:31.520
hour comedy show hosted by Scott Aukerman, who is hilarious, with guests like Amy Poehler.

18:31.520 --> 18:35.840
This Friday, it's got Zach Galifianakis who discusses what would happen if dogs could talk.

18:35.840 --> 18:42.140
Tune in. Hey, so, uh, uh, uh, we have a question asked from somebody who is here and they can

18:42.140 --> 18:45.040
feel free to raise their hand if they like. We're not. If you're ashamed to be a part

18:45.040 --> 18:50.280
of this, I understand. I don't mind. It's about, it's about butt sores. I don't, I don't know.

18:50.280 --> 18:53.040
I'm sorry. I was going to say, no, it's not about butt sores. I'm sorry. It's about being

18:53.040 --> 18:58.240
on, Griffin had to excuse himself from the podcast for a minute. It's about being on

18:58.240 --> 19:05.380
job hunt. Does anyone want to claim it? Okay. It is you. Okay. Hey, you got it right. Um,

19:05.380 --> 19:09.680
so Lindsay asks, I'm currently on the job hunt and it is the worst. I graduated with

19:09.680 --> 19:13.960
BFA in theater design and technology a few years ago and although I really love it, I

19:13.960 --> 19:17.800
felt the stability of a more traditional job. The only non theater job experience I have

19:17.800 --> 19:22.080
is one of a brief customer service gig. So my resume is pretty sparse. At this point

19:22.080 --> 19:26.580
I'm down for anything more or less. What should I do? That's from Lindsay. Um, do you know

19:26.580 --> 19:31.000
anything about making PowerPoint presentations and booking famous people? I'm making people

19:31.000 --> 19:38.520
not like nervous in front of other people. Yeah. Reminding us to take our pepsi. Yeah.

19:38.520 --> 19:42.320
Slapping drinks out of our hand the night before we perform. You have to be funny in

19:42.320 --> 19:49.400
eight hours. Uh, so when you say theater designs, it's pretty broad. Where was it like lights

19:49.400 --> 19:55.080
costume? Hey guys, I happen to know a little bit about theater. All right. That's, this

19:55.080 --> 20:05.280
should make for great. It happens to be my profession. Lighting. Ah, that sucks. What's

20:05.280 --> 20:10.040
your point? A computer can do that nowadays. Learn, learn to build things. Computers can't

20:10.040 --> 20:18.320
do that yet. Yet. What if she learned to build the computers? What do you know about computers?

20:18.320 --> 20:29.760
I've had a computer thing or like a snake. You're learning about pythons. Well, if you

20:29.760 --> 20:36.080
know pythons, since Jack Hanna would love to have you come on. We actually need a new

20:36.080 --> 20:42.680
Python lady, which isn't a job so much as it's a title. It's very, it's very, it's very

20:42.680 --> 20:49.040
close to a Carney. Um, the Python lady. But, uh, listen, I didn't appreciate how much you

20:49.040 --> 20:54.920
guys laughed at us for not knowing about Python. This is the wrong, but I guess when I did

20:54.920 --> 21:05.800
a Skyrim goof earlier that a Python would probably fucking guys. Tough crowd. This is

21:05.800 --> 21:16.360
awesome. So let me pull it back in. You're the one I turned to to reel it back in. I'll

21:16.360 --> 21:22.440
be the anchor of this team once more. Um, so anything, it's not a theater job. So like

21:22.440 --> 21:27.400
every other job. Yeah. Can you travel back in time and retroactively study a different

21:27.400 --> 21:34.520
profession? I guess it's like literally anything else. I mean, they're probably human beings.

21:34.520 --> 21:39.600
The only thing that human beings, I watched a documentary on Netflix about eyeballs. You

21:39.600 --> 21:47.600
don't see like people, you see the light refracting off of the people. So you are responsible

21:47.600 --> 21:55.280
for all human sight. So like any other thing, any other job depends on lighting. So I guess

21:55.280 --> 22:04.000
just say that to an employer at Arby's. And so Mr. CEO, this ends my presentation on eyeballs.

22:04.000 --> 22:11.880
I will look. It's eyeballs colon. Please hire me. I will look for my first paycheck. Uh,

22:11.880 --> 22:21.200
so have we helped you? Uh, are you rich and famous out? We, we, uh, you can do this. This

22:21.200 --> 22:25.600
is easy. It takes literally nothing. It takes literally no degrees that qualifies to do

22:25.600 --> 22:33.600
this. Um, so that didn't go over well. Yeah. Jesus. You could all do it right now. That's

22:33.600 --> 22:39.160
who wants to trade out. I will tag you in. I would love to just catch like a 20 minute

22:39.160 --> 22:44.040
power nap to be completely honest. Uh, this Yahoo answer was sent in by Krista Whelan.

22:44.040 --> 22:49.120
Thank you Krista. It's by Yahoo answers user Alphonse who asks, would you attend church

22:49.120 --> 22:58.400
more if they served pizza for communion ceremony? Only if it was bagel bites. Yeah. I would

22:58.400 --> 23:01.960
go for the pizza alone. The heck with their dead guy gods and their mythologies. I would

23:01.960 --> 23:07.880
be good just long enough for the pizza and beer. It's a little, was that you or the,

23:07.880 --> 23:13.760
no, no, no. I, you know, you know where my heart is. It's with both Jesus and pizza,

23:13.760 --> 23:17.480
which is why I could be so, so down with this idea. I think this is the kind of reinvention

23:17.480 --> 23:22.040
that the modern church needs. Right. Well then why stop there? If you're going to do

23:22.040 --> 23:28.080
like pizza for the community, why not make like a, instead of the wine, some Josta. Yeah.

23:28.080 --> 23:34.760
Six people know what Josta is. Josta! With Guarana. I think, I think it's, I think it's

23:34.760 --> 23:38.560
definitely time to turn up the heat because all we've had for a while is churches trying

23:38.560 --> 23:42.560
to lure young people in with like, check it out. We got acoustic guitars now. Did you

23:42.560 --> 23:47.360
see? Um, I think we need to make churches as, as. Like what? Like give me some, what

23:47.360 --> 23:51.560
are some innovations? What's going to make it. When I say rad church, what do you think?

23:51.560 --> 23:55.480
Like a right. What if it was a righteous church and we could say righteous both in the Jeezy

23:55.480 --> 24:02.880
way and then like the surfboard way, like first United Methodist righteous church. Give

24:02.880 --> 24:06.440
me some, what's at the righteous church? What can I entertain? You can have like, uh, you

24:06.440 --> 24:13.400
can have bagel bites instead of communion, Josta instead of wine. Um, what? Skyrim. Skyrim.

24:13.400 --> 24:19.400
Sure. You can have kids love. Skyrim in place of what? Like the Bible? Or like it's one

24:19.400 --> 24:23.080
in and one out kind of thing. You can't just add it. You can have a, you can have a water

24:23.080 --> 24:27.560
slide that goes into the basically you want to make a church as though it's run by the

24:27.560 --> 24:41.440
kid from blank check. What if God had a million dollars? What if God were a call kid and he

24:41.440 --> 24:46.120
had a million dollars? What wouldn't he do? No, no, no, no. Oh, it looks like I ran over

24:46.120 --> 24:54.000
God's bike. Here's a million dollars. Thanks, Carla Gugino. Hey, by the way, what if God

24:54.000 --> 24:58.880
had a Carla Gugino? Uh, the movie Blank Check if you haven't seen it has a love affair between

24:58.880 --> 25:07.440
a 10 year old kid and Carla Gugino. It's a pretty messed up movie. Scott, there's a lot

25:07.440 --> 25:12.400
of blank check fans. I'm learning so much about like three people in this audience.

25:12.400 --> 25:21.160
Yeah. Um, so another question here from a, a, a, a listener of ours. I have a friend

25:21.160 --> 25:30.520
who will be getting a puppy soon. She is excited. I would like her friends and family. She would

25:30.520 --> 25:45.960
like her friends and family to attend a puppy shower. We're ready Quetzalcoatl. Come get

25:45.960 --> 25:55.560
us a puppy shower. I'll a baby shower. It's so wicked. Not a baby shower. Yeah. The extent

25:55.560 --> 26:00.600
to which it's not a baby shower. Come on guys, I'm having a taco shower. I'm going to make

26:00.600 --> 26:06.480
a taco and then I'm going to eat it. Come bring me gifts. Guess the flavor. That's right.

26:06.480 --> 26:16.320
It's taco. The best part came with taco showers. Um, so it's a baby shower and they says in

26:16.320 --> 26:23.920
parentheses, gifts are expected. I refuse to participate in this and all puppy themed

26:23.920 --> 26:31.000
events. I anticipate invites to fur further puppy at birthdays, graduations and wedding

26:31.000 --> 26:38.720
parties. Wait, what? We have a hard time pushing through gay marriage, but puppy marriage is

26:38.720 --> 26:49.360
totally cool. As long as it's between a girl puppy and a guy puppy. Um, God damn it. How

26:49.360 --> 26:54.080
can I decline politely? And when she asked, explain my decision without hurting her feelings

26:54.080 --> 26:59.840
or telling her she's crazy. And that's from pup P kicker. Um, that's a little, that's

26:59.840 --> 27:04.840
taking a little too far. It's a little too much. Uh, I kind of feel like if someone gives

27:04.840 --> 27:09.880
you an invitation to a puppy shower, it is actually an invitation to end your relationship

27:09.880 --> 27:16.220
with them to, to, to discontinue your association. Like, Hey, this is your out. Uh, you're not

27:16.220 --> 27:22.360
just explain it to them. Like, no, no, that's dumb. You're a stupid person. What kind of

27:22.360 --> 27:26.280
friend are you? If you don't let them know when they're doing or know the war, you wouldn't

27:26.280 --> 27:30.480
come to my taco shower and you expect me to roll up to your puppy shower. This, this thing

27:30.480 --> 27:33.600
is the worst thing that you're doing and I'm your friend. So I'm going to tell you, that's

27:33.600 --> 27:38.600
really your only two options. Either you discontinue the relationship, which listen, that's where

27:38.600 --> 27:42.800
I'm leaning, but I don't have, you know, I, you know, your friend didn't save me and I'm,

27:42.800 --> 27:46.240
I don't know what it was that is keeping the two of you tied together. It's very easy for

27:46.240 --> 27:51.480
me from my position here at the throat of the world to tell you to end this relationship.

27:51.480 --> 27:56.680
Um, additional details. My friend once saved my life. Yeah, right. Uh, yeah, that makes

27:56.680 --> 28:01.880
it adds up. You either have to, you either have to end the relationship or talk your

28:01.880 --> 28:08.200
friend out of this. It's the worst. You get a puppy and it's like, just go with, like,

28:08.200 --> 28:13.160
just be at my house now. You're a puppy. Can I, can I throw some, some ideas, spaghetti

28:13.160 --> 28:16.880
against the wall and we'll see if it sticks. Yes. There's my idea. Spaghetti out. Just

28:16.880 --> 28:24.400
picture in your mind's eye, uh, a puppy in like a Justin's graduation robe. And I like

28:24.400 --> 28:32.640
tell me that you couldn't, you couldn't get down with that. Okay. All right. I could go

28:32.640 --> 28:38.120
that far, but I think once we get to like puppy gift registries, I think I would probably

28:38.120 --> 28:46.840
have to back out. Puppy funerals. I know I'm not. You were all on board when we're against

28:46.840 --> 28:50.800
the birthday. If we're going to create something, you're all in favor of the funeral, right?

28:50.800 --> 28:54.680
You're right. If we're formal, if we're like, if we're building these codified ceremonies

28:54.680 --> 29:00.480
for puppy events, it will be fucked up not to do funerals for you. I told Griffin that

29:00.480 --> 29:05.160
we couldn't pull it back from ending a question about we're going to try everything about

29:05.160 --> 29:12.880
puppy caskets and how tiny and adorable they would be. Go on. Think about it. And you're

29:12.880 --> 29:19.360
laughing. The casket would have four saddles on it so that four smaller puppies could carry

29:19.360 --> 29:38.640
it. Hey guys. Yeah. I'd like to slow it down for a minute from time to time. Whenever I

29:38.640 --> 29:42.720
decide that the crowd is special enough, I like to create a little something for them.

29:42.720 --> 29:53.520
So I've written, fuck this. Oh, God damn it. So I've written a mad lib. He's written a

29:53.520 --> 29:57.240
sad lib. It's a sad lib. Don't let him ever try to convince you otherwise. I've written

29:57.240 --> 30:03.320
a mad lib. Yeah, actually he wrote a jumble of words and you all made it sad. And everybody

30:03.320 --> 30:09.560
here, they contributed words. And it's because you people are also special to me and I love

30:09.560 --> 30:12.600
you so much. You do a sad lib voice when you're trying to get into it. I'm trying to be as

30:12.600 --> 30:17.000
pathetic as possible so people won't beat me up. Mission accomplished. So I made you

30:17.000 --> 30:20.240
this thing from my heart. Okay, now if you're not that familiar with that show, here's a

30:20.240 --> 30:25.200
few things you should know about this bit. It's not funny. We stopped doing it. We stopped

30:25.200 --> 30:30.080
doing it. You know why? It's not funny. I made it because I care about you all. It's

30:30.080 --> 30:35.600
just that you're so special to me. And I made so many friends this weekend and I feel like

30:35.600 --> 30:41.200
this is a safe place where people can just be themselves and we don't have to be afraid.

30:41.200 --> 30:49.000
And so I decided it's a page and a half long, but it's from my heart. And I'd like you all

30:49.000 --> 30:53.040
to join me on this rollercoaster. I'm on Facebook on my computer while you do this. Okay. Your

30:53.040 --> 30:57.760
girlfriend's gonna write on Facebook about how good it is while I do it. He's gonna live

30:57.760 --> 31:04.320
Facebook my mad lib. I wish I could poke this bit to death. I am. I don't actually want

31:04.320 --> 31:11.260
to be sitting here and be associated. Okay. They don't want to be swept into the glow

31:11.260 --> 31:17.960
because I love you so much. I love you all. I love you all so much. So this is a special

31:17.960 --> 31:28.040
thing that I've written for you, my friends. And so he goes a little something like this

31:28.040 --> 31:33.740
and it's, it's all about Max Fun Con because you guys are so special to me. Each and every

31:33.740 --> 31:46.640
one of you. I am. And it goes a little something like this. Um, and basically how mad live

31:46.640 --> 31:55.760
works. And so if anybody needs to know, we'll talk about it afterwards. I'll tell you all

31:55.760 --> 32:11.080
about it. Um, it was a scrumptious and salty day at Max Fun Con. The tuba had risen and

32:11.080 --> 32:16.440
all the dinosaurs were chirping. Jesse looked down from his library on high and watched

32:16.440 --> 32:22.640
all the cats attending the conference as they began flying one another. He smiled to himself

32:22.640 --> 32:27.400
flyingly. Now I want to take a short break from the narrative here to thank the person

32:27.400 --> 32:34.200
that gave me both of those words. When suddenly David Reese punched into the room, sir, the

32:34.200 --> 32:50.920
bears are fisting the horse. Are you laughing with me or at me? And the unicorn has already

32:50.920 --> 32:58.760
slept. And if we don't exsanguinate the shoehorn soon, then this whole place could push. But

32:58.760 --> 33:05.600
Jim, but Jesse simply macerated and placed his and placed his elbow on David Reese's

33:05.600 --> 33:18.160
spleen. Don't you worry. He traipsed. It's all going according to diving board. And if

33:18.160 --> 33:25.440
anyone would like a copy of that, it'll be available in my book coming out soon. There's

33:25.440 --> 33:35.120
orange juice everywhere. Who did this? I hope it's available in your obituary. He doesn't

33:35.120 --> 33:41.080
mean it. I mean, he doesn't know how to express himself. That's exactly. No, I said exactly

33:41.080 --> 33:49.720
what I'm saying. Hey, do you want to I heard you guys laughing. Please don't do that. Next

33:49.720 --> 33:54.080
time, like when you're here at Max Fun Con 2015 and you're having to hear one of these

33:54.080 --> 33:57.800
again, like you're saying they're going to skip three years because of how terrible that

33:57.800 --> 34:12.720
was. No comedy can grow here anymore. There really is nothing worse than choking at the

34:12.720 --> 34:17.320
throat of the world. Maybe the elevation has something to do with the reason why people

34:17.320 --> 34:21.240
were laughing because the oxygen, they're so oxygen deprived. They can laugh at anything.

34:21.240 --> 34:25.760
These are the same people who thought dead puppies was hysterical. I mean, I worked that

34:25.760 --> 34:32.520
into like a, you know, if I didn't know better, you don't. This Yahoo answer was sent in by

34:32.520 --> 34:38.800
phallic, which isn't spelled the dirty way. I was asked by Yahoo answers user V who asks,

34:38.800 --> 34:53.800
how do you eat a hot pocket? Additional details. I always get burned frowny face. Now the top

34:53.800 --> 35:03.040
answer on this one was let it cool down. Oh, yeah. Much easier. That would be much better

35:03.040 --> 35:09.600
than what I do, but I need the hot pocket right now. I'm so hungry. Uh, Griffin, I have

35:09.600 --> 35:14.680
a method. Oh, good. This is legit. And you guys can cool it with your tears. I don't

35:14.680 --> 35:26.960
need hot pockets. I lean pockets cause I'm an adult. Just the worst. See, it's a, it's

35:26.960 --> 35:31.520
a pro method. You'd buy a corner off and then you buy it another corner. By the way, when

35:31.520 --> 35:34.440
I'm done explaining this, can I get a round of applause? If anybody else imagined here,

35:34.440 --> 35:38.240
this also, you buy two quarters off and then you blow in one and create a steam chair.

35:38.240 --> 35:58.800
Do not celebrate his hot pocket ocarina alone. Can you open face a hot pocket? Is that, I

35:58.800 --> 36:02.600
don't know that there are, maybe you could food process it and then put it in like another

36:02.600 --> 36:11.360
thing. I don't judge him. You don't know him. You laughed at Travis' dumb thing. I know.

36:11.360 --> 36:19.560
I use every part of the hot pocket. The best bits are left on the sleeve after you microwave

36:19.560 --> 36:22.920
and not a lot of people know this. The first step with any hot pocket is you shear the

36:22.920 --> 36:30.040
crust off to get to the filling inside. Sure, sure. You get the hot pocket rind off. I think

36:30.040 --> 36:36.720
the saddest thing that I've done with a hot pocket. Oh God. This will be great. I think

36:36.720 --> 36:41.840
the second saddest thing I've done with a hot pocket is, uh, sometimes I'll decide I'm

36:41.840 --> 36:45.680
going to have a hot pocket and you know what that decision feels like, but then I'll put

36:45.680 --> 36:51.120
it in the oven. I know I'm going to be hungry in 30 minutes. I'm going to take the time

36:51.120 --> 36:55.800
and really make this hot pocket right. That is no joke. The fucking saddest thing I've

36:55.800 --> 37:06.880
ever heard. Cause you could put anything else in that oven. Cause what you're doing is cooking.

37:06.880 --> 37:11.920
That is cooking. That is what cooking is. You got, you have, I do. I put a little, um,

37:11.920 --> 37:19.240
Parmesan on there. You fucking, you fucking chop and screw the hot pocket. No, this is

37:19.240 --> 37:25.800
the second saddest thing I've ever done with a hot pocket. Not the first. I always get

37:25.800 --> 37:34.080
burned. Three people over here knew what that was. How long do you guys cook hot pockets?

37:34.080 --> 37:38.880
Two 15. Two 15? That's what it says on the foil. No, Sydney does two 15. I do one 50.

37:38.880 --> 37:46.000
I like a little al dente. You like a little pink. You like a medium rare. You like your

37:46.000 --> 37:49.280
hot pocket bleeding. Which is good. Cause that's pretty much what they do no matter

37:49.280 --> 37:56.160
what. Al dente of course is French for sloppy. I like that. I like that. That cheese to just

37:56.160 --> 38:00.920
sort of glop out. I don't like it all piping hot. What you're describing is the hot pockets

38:00.920 --> 38:08.200
natural state of being. I'll eat them raw. I don't care. Hey, wait, like, like a hot

38:08.200 --> 38:15.840
pocket you find raw in nature? Yeah. That's how, that's how the devil tempted Eve. Plucked

38:15.840 --> 38:20.120
a hot pocket off the knowledge tree. The tree of the knowledge of yourself. Tree of the

38:20.120 --> 38:24.540
knowledge of how desperately alone all of us are. My wife and I are expecting our first

38:24.540 --> 38:29.000
child soon and we're torn over names if we have a baby boy. I don't remember adding this

38:29.000 --> 38:33.720
question to the list. Well, we both like some names now, but my wife has suggested naming

38:33.720 --> 38:40.320
our child Griffin. She's in love with the name and wants it to be, wants it even more

38:40.320 --> 38:45.040
after listening to some of your fantastic podcasts. My question is, can my baby live

38:45.040 --> 38:51.720
up to the supreme awesomeness that is the name? Signed from Griffin. Sincerely Griffin.

38:51.720 --> 38:59.400
My concern is him falling short of the stratospheric level that MBMB AM's Griffin has set. I guess

38:59.400 --> 39:05.320
Blake Griffin, he's a good basketball man. Uh, Peter Griffin, uh, please advise. That's

39:05.320 --> 39:13.380
from perplexed, almost parent. Do you know how everybody thinks their kids the best?

39:13.380 --> 39:17.320
Do you know how little anticipation you have to have your kids back? I hope he's as good

39:17.320 --> 39:26.160
as that podcaster I like. He could be anything between here and here. Yeah, right. In this

39:26.160 --> 39:35.520
narrow range of kid. I think that this is a availed plea for me to, uh, take this person's

39:35.520 --> 39:43.480
child under my wing to train them. Not like, I thought you meant like for protective services.

39:43.480 --> 39:48.920
Do you mean like, you mean like more of a rumple still skin situation where you show

39:48.920 --> 39:54.160
up? I have not read it. I have not read the story, but you spend some stuff into stuff

39:54.160 --> 39:59.760
and then you take the baby. Wait, what was the end game in rumble still skin? There is

39:59.760 --> 40:03.880
no end game. It actually doesn't. He flies away on a spoon. It was mother goose's final,

40:03.880 --> 40:11.480
uh, her unfinished. She didn't finish before she died. Mother goose died, everybody. How's

40:11.480 --> 40:17.520
your Sunday? Match fun condo was good till the end. I'm saying I could be, I could give

40:17.520 --> 40:22.040
this person artisanal Griffin training. Okay. You make the artisanal Griffin. I can show

40:22.040 --> 40:25.960
not how to make an artisanal Griffin, how to be, how to just, I just love the thick

40:25.960 --> 40:31.560
crust on the Griffin. It's so fresh. Oh, you can really taste the basil in the Griffin.

40:31.560 --> 40:39.160
I can train them in the proper formula of hazelnut, like coffee mate to coffee to get

40:39.160 --> 40:45.200
a fresh brew every morning. That's my only, that's my only fucking skill. Now you all

40:45.200 --> 40:50.200
know the secret. Griffin, what you were describing is raising a child. Like you teach it the

40:50.200 --> 40:53.840
things that you know, so it knows those things. Like, is that what you're saying? Like you

40:53.840 --> 40:58.600
write raising a child. Like how long do you anticipate this process? Day game? I honestly,

40:58.600 --> 41:05.080
I don't know that much shit. So maybe like a week and a half. Guys, I just got the latest

41:05.080 --> 41:11.840
allure magazine and it is entirely dedicated to Snooki's vagina. Not again. It's called

41:11.840 --> 41:18.040
Snooki puss. It's called allure, the Snooki puss fall issue. Why do they keep doing that?

41:18.040 --> 41:24.560
I wish modern magazines would cater to my tastes. Like what? Like old buttons? Oh, with

41:24.560 --> 41:30.800
the alley oop. With the commercial alley oop is Travis McElroy reading things off the internet

41:30.800 --> 41:36.160
page that he has in front of him. Like Justin, would you say that you are more of a kooky

41:36.160 --> 41:42.480
aunt or a cranky uncle? Kooky aunt. In terms of magazine consumption. I'm a hide the kids

41:42.480 --> 41:50.280
uncle. Well, if you go to Penelope popsicle.com, you can get a magazine subscription from the

41:50.280 --> 41:54.500
past for the modern magazine reader. Basically what it is, is say for this month instead

41:54.500 --> 42:01.240
of giving, getting a magazine from June 2012. The Snooki puss issue. The Snooki puss issue.

42:01.240 --> 42:05.920
I hate you for making me say those words. You would get a June issue from some bygone

42:05.920 --> 42:12.520
year in the past. So it's a pretty cool idea. And you just go to Penelope popsicle.com.

42:12.520 --> 42:17.520
And included with each one's mailing is an exciting envelope of ephemera, which I think

42:17.520 --> 42:23.440
is ectoplasm. I'm not 100% sure. It's dead people's hair. So I look forward to that.

42:23.440 --> 42:26.480
They get the dead people and they take a hair from them and they put them in envelopes and

42:26.480 --> 42:32.000
send them out for good. Every month. For omens. And now here's our jingle. Wait, oom bop pa

42:32.000 --> 42:39.240
oom bop, oom bop pa oom bop. Penelope popsicle. New magazines are bullshit. You gotta get

42:39.240 --> 42:45.760
those old magazines. They don't talk about vaginas of Snooki. There's a key change.

42:45.760 --> 42:56.000
Of Snooki. Penelope popsicle.com.

42:56.000 --> 43:00.320
Hi I'm Justin McElroy here for Extreme Restraints. I'm talking to my wife Sydney. Sydney, have

43:00.320 --> 43:04.320
you gotten the distinct impression that things have gotten, you know, a little dull in the

43:04.320 --> 43:09.720
bedroom? Well, I didn't want to say anything. Well, it's okay. I'm saying it for you. Sharing

43:09.720 --> 43:14.880
is caring. Well, now that you mention it. Well, great news. I bought a plug to put in

43:14.880 --> 43:20.440
your butt. I know what you're saying. Where did you get one of that size and contour?

43:20.440 --> 43:28.600
Well, I got one at ExtremeRestraints.com. I use the coupon code MIDDLIST and got a 20%

43:28.600 --> 43:32.920
off of my entire purchase area if you can believe it. How did you know that's just what

43:32.920 --> 43:39.680
I wanted? Well, there's one thing I know. It's how to check a wish list that you hide

43:39.680 --> 43:46.880
in your copy of Fifty Shades of Grey. So go to ExtremeRestraints.com and find things like

43:46.880 --> 43:51.480
a giant tub of lube or a cage for your wiener. You know how you're always saying you'd like

43:51.480 --> 43:55.600
to put my wiener in a cage? Well, I wasn't going to share that with everyone, but yeah.

43:55.600 --> 44:01.520
It's too late. This is the internet and now everyone knows, but I got this cage. Look.

44:01.520 --> 44:05.360
I'll unzip my pants and you can look at it. That's the most beautiful penis cage I've

44:05.360 --> 44:10.880
ever seen. That's what marriage is all about. ExtremeRestraints.com. Thanks, guys. Go to

44:10.880 --> 44:17.000
ExtremeRestraints.com and use the coupon code MIDDLIST to save 20%. There's another bit

44:17.000 --> 44:21.420
we do on this show sometimes, but we stopped doing it because it, again... Not very good.

44:21.420 --> 44:25.080
Not very good. Not a good bit, but lots of people demanded its return. So ladies and

44:25.080 --> 44:31.360
gentlemen... That's not how we intro this bit, though. Hey guys, what day is it? You

44:31.360 --> 44:36.560
didn't answer my fucking question. According to my MacBook, it's Sunday, June 3rd, 2012.

44:36.560 --> 44:43.000
Is it really June already? Where does the time go? This slow march towards death. This

44:43.000 --> 44:48.360
is our first episode. We are releasing this, right? This isn't just a special... Let's

44:48.360 --> 44:54.200
see how it goes. All right. This episode is our first episode in the month of June, so

44:54.200 --> 45:00.440
let's observe a few... I'll call them words of warning for monthly observances for the

45:00.440 --> 45:08.020
month of June from the website BrownieLocks.com. No joke, I should have prepared this one.

45:08.020 --> 45:16.920
Let's see. It is... Oh, God. Celibacy Awareness Month. I don't think anyone's not aware that

45:16.920 --> 45:25.000
they're celibate. I don't think a moment goes by. Okay. Show of hands. Show of hands. No,

45:25.000 --> 45:30.120
don't play. No, please don't. This show is depressing enough already. I'm just kidding.

45:30.120 --> 45:38.160
I think all of you are getting it. Black Music Month. I'm sorry. Black Music Month. Jesus

45:38.160 --> 45:49.080
Christ. It's International Surf Music Month. June is Turkey Lovers Month. It is... I think

45:49.080 --> 45:57.600
Jeff just guessed, if I remember correctly, from the message board. It is Potty Training

45:57.600 --> 46:02.680
Awareness Month. Okay, let's go with that. Okay. Potty Training Awareness Month. That's

46:02.680 --> 46:08.440
the month that you make everybody terribly aware that you are in fact potty trained.

46:08.440 --> 46:11.440
That's where you, when you meet someone on the street, say, oh yeah, I've got like a

46:11.440 --> 46:17.200
wall of grape stickers every time. Don't even worry about it. I make the bad guys go in

46:17.200 --> 46:22.840
the hole. It's not even a big deal. My daddy showed me where my pee pee goes. Oh, my boom

46:22.840 --> 46:29.120
booms? Totally on lockdown. Don't worry about my boomers. They're going down the tubes.

46:29.120 --> 46:35.980
There's a special chair that my daddy showed me where to sit to do my thing. That chair

46:35.980 --> 46:46.000
goes on top of my daddy's toilet. He says it's only for big boys. So how are you enjoying

46:46.000 --> 46:51.960
Max Fun Con? Okay, show of hands. How many of you are potty trained? Who up in this piece

46:51.960 --> 47:01.240
is potty trained? Not a lot. There's like a third of the audience is like, I don't,

47:01.240 --> 47:09.400
I don't know. I'm like, I feel like I'm close enough to master it, but I don't want to lie.

47:09.400 --> 47:15.960
What if there's a test? What if there's a test? Oh, really? Poop in the toilet. Come

47:15.960 --> 47:22.560
on, big boy. Show of proof time. This isn't just a podcast. It's a test of will. Potty

47:22.560 --> 47:29.040
training awareness. Who is not aware that that is an important thing that has to happen?

47:29.040 --> 47:32.400
That's sort of like taking your kid out of the hot car awareness. Like, yeah, you should

47:32.400 --> 47:42.240
do that. Kids are real soft. Guys, you've got to jump in here because I'll talk about

47:42.240 --> 47:49.160
it. What else is there to talk about in potty training awareness? Goof bit run. I'll come

47:49.160 --> 48:02.160
up with something. If you let me dangle here long enough. Potty training. Oh no. I just

48:02.160 --> 48:08.600
got it. Welcome. We can make people aware of the profession of a potty, professional

48:08.600 --> 48:15.600
potty trainer. With a chair and a whip. You got to control the potty stuff now. I'm sorry.

48:15.600 --> 48:21.280
I'm sorry. I tried to back out halfway through. Sometimes British people call shoes trainers.

48:21.280 --> 48:28.040
Is there a joke in that? Let's discuss. Let's sit here for 10 minutes and think about it.

48:28.040 --> 48:32.160
See if we had a movie right now we'd play. Like here's a movie. We're going to go workshop

48:32.160 --> 48:39.960
some potty groups like we should have done this morning, like I said. It's okay. I came

48:39.960 --> 48:47.720
up with one. It's my potty and I'll cry if I want to. Deal with that knowledge that I

48:47.720 --> 48:55.360
said that and you paid a bunch of money to hear me say it. I just did the math and that

48:55.360 --> 49:03.960
joke cost you $10 to hear. For those listening at home, I just gave a big thumbs up. What

49:03.960 --> 49:08.840
did we do? What did we do? Oh, it's your turn. Let's do a regular question. Okay. You like

49:08.840 --> 49:13.800
that flow? Love it. We'll edit that out. You like that flow? Potty training awareness.

49:13.800 --> 49:26.280
Thank you. We're back. Back on top. I like to sit quietly for 10 minutes. Potty training

49:26.280 --> 49:35.760
awareness. Oh my God. My boyfriend and I are engaged and getting married in the fall. The

49:35.760 --> 49:43.080
issue, I hate the word fiance. Something about it sounds pretentious and like when a college

49:43.080 --> 49:48.360
student freshly back from semester abroad in Italy refuses to pronounce bruschetta as

49:48.360 --> 49:54.280
an English word, but insists on saying bruschetta with a Mario accent. You could do better than

49:54.280 --> 50:12.360
that. Let me try again. This is really bad jerking off though. I'm just tapping it. I'm

50:12.360 --> 50:27.960
just swinging it back and forth. Oh, I was misreading the motion. He can't finish if

50:27.960 --> 50:48.720
you're laughing. Potty training awareness. For those of you at home, he's still doing

50:48.720 --> 50:52.040
it. He's making a vigorous jerk off motion with his hands. It's like a figure eight at

50:52.040 --> 51:02.040
this point. It's a wild elliptical jerk. It's a mobile strip of hand job. I really appreciate

51:02.040 --> 51:05.120
that you guys are still laughing at. The reason I'm still doing it is because I know there's

51:05.120 --> 51:15.040
one person in this audience who's like, I don't get it. I'm waiting for it to click.

51:15.040 --> 51:29.800
I know it's ridiculous, but the word fiance is to me what damp, moist, and other pet pee

51:29.800 --> 51:36.240
words are to others. Can you suggest some other words to refer to my boyfriend until

51:36.240 --> 51:45.680
September? Thanks for your help. Words to refer to your fiance. Forever boyfriend. What

51:45.680 --> 51:55.000
about Beyonce? That would make me feel pretty good. This is my Beyonce, Trevor. He liked

51:55.000 --> 52:02.600
it so he put a ring on it. Yeah. What about calling him your maybe husband? Because let's

52:02.600 --> 52:08.560
be honest, you're not there yet. There's a lot of things that can happen. There's a lot

52:08.560 --> 52:13.040
of track left on this. Griffin, tell me everything you know about planning a wedding. Oh fuck,

52:13.040 --> 52:19.280
you got to get flowers, cake. You got to say yes to the dress. You got to say yes to the

52:19.280 --> 52:26.560
dress. You got a cake boss. You got a flower wars. You got a bucks for tux, which is a

52:26.560 --> 52:32.880
new show on TLC. You got a preacher fight. You got a what? Preacher fight at the righteous

52:32.880 --> 52:37.800
church. At righteous church? Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, preacher fight at righteous church.

52:37.800 --> 52:49.560
Two men in the club are tearing it all off. There's flower boy charm school. Okay. You

52:49.560 --> 52:55.120
know there's no such thing as a flower boy, right? Flower man charm school. That was almost

52:55.120 --> 53:00.360
a really nice callback. Um, fuck. I don't like that word either. I don't think. Cause

53:00.360 --> 53:06.840
every time I see it on paper, I read it as finance. It's like fiance, but with a, there's

53:06.840 --> 53:13.560
like an N. I think I get it. That's just not, it didn't really hit me. It doesn't land.

53:13.560 --> 53:18.920
Sometimes two words. They look similar with like one or two letters. Not every joke's

53:18.920 --> 53:21.320
for everybody. There was that one guy who didn't like it when I did the thing with my

53:21.320 --> 53:26.240
hand for so long. That's okay. Nothing to feel ashamed of. Can you just call him by

53:26.240 --> 53:32.640
his name? Yeah. This is my Steve. Do you mean this is my Steve Steve? This is my Steve Steve.

53:32.640 --> 53:37.520
Oh, because you know what the double names is forever. What if, uh, what if he has a

53:37.520 --> 53:41.880
terrible name like Gordon and then you just don't. What's wrong with Gordon? I said it

53:41.880 --> 53:53.240
and I can do it. He's my Gordon Gordon. It instantly makes you sound like an idiot. As

53:53.240 --> 53:57.400
opposed to if it was a double of a normal name. Right. Not most names you can get away

53:57.400 --> 54:02.500
with saying twice if that sounded too weird. Uh, this Yahoo answer, uh, was sent to my

54:02.500 --> 54:09.520
Earl Parsons. Thank you Earl. It's by Yahoo answer user Dr. Terry genius. Who asked, how

54:09.520 --> 54:18.040
do I ask my dad to stop kissing me on the lips?

54:18.040 --> 54:32.160
You guys jumped to a conclusion. You haven't even heard the background. I am 22 years old.

54:32.160 --> 54:35.840
He keeps wanting to kiss me. I don't want to kiss him on the lips anymore. How do I

54:35.840 --> 54:44.680
ask him to stop? Hey, can you just, Dan, can you stop that? Let's wrap. There's only, there's

54:44.680 --> 54:52.040
only one surefire way. And that's to grow a beard. That's, that's why our dad could

54:52.040 --> 54:56.120
kick in that door any minute and come smooth to Justin and I on the mouth and try. What's

54:56.120 --> 55:07.720
it? Travis and not proud of you. I heard what he did. Look to your left. Look to your right.

55:07.720 --> 55:11.600
One of these people has a beard and their parents are apparently not proud of them.

55:11.600 --> 55:19.720
It's like a shame, shame carpet that you wear on your face. Daddy, please. It's like a science

55:19.720 --> 55:26.520
to me. It's just that I could shave. No, no, daddy's allowed. Yeah. This is a daddy freeze.

55:26.520 --> 55:33.640
You could shave that into your beard. No daddies allow. And then go to a job interview. Literally

55:33.640 --> 55:38.400
anywhere on the planet. Hello. I only know about lighting and it says this on my face.

55:38.400 --> 55:47.160
Am I good? Do I have a kind of a job now? Lindsay doesn't have a beard for those of

55:47.160 --> 55:52.640
you at home. And if she did, it would, she would be too tasteful not to carve anything

55:52.640 --> 56:00.160
into it except her basketball jersey number. You have to get a third party involved in

56:00.160 --> 56:04.420
this at this point, right? For if you're 22, you've certainly hinted to your father that

56:04.420 --> 56:07.560
you're not interested. Are you saying it's time for litigation? I'm saying it's time

56:07.560 --> 56:15.440
during a fire. In the final episode of Perry Mason. Uh, Perry Mason was a show about a

56:15.440 --> 56:31.400
joke. Let me try again. Crash Bandicoot. Where's the joke? Just a word that people knew. Surefire

56:31.400 --> 56:40.240
words. Yeah. In this episode of cherry pop tarts. Are we cool? Um, you just ask, right?

56:40.240 --> 56:43.880
It's just as simple as asking. Yeah. And then you bring it up. Unless it's not. Can you

56:43.880 --> 56:49.560
please stop? No, no, no. Unfortunately, I just simply cannot stop doing that. Have you,

56:49.560 --> 56:56.720
have you seen those, those, uh, I love it. I love talking, talking meat, your talk flesh

56:56.720 --> 57:02.320
right here. Oh, I, some of you didn't grow up in West Virginia. That's what we call mouths

57:02.320 --> 57:12.280
in West Virginia. Not yet, but I'm trying to get it going. Um, Oh God. How many more

57:12.280 --> 57:16.960
yahoo's do you have Griffin? I have just the one. Okay. Uh, let me ask this question. I

57:16.960 --> 57:21.800
got a friend of mine on Facebook asks, what is the girl equivalent of a bromance? I had

57:21.800 --> 57:26.880
always figured that girls had the lockdown on hetero BFFs since the beginning of pajama

57:26.880 --> 57:31.840
parties and group bathroom visits and that there really isn't any trendy word for it.

57:31.840 --> 57:37.360
But I don't want to dismiss the question before I asked the smartest guys I know. Oh God damn.

57:37.360 --> 57:43.080
And then I emailed you guys. Yeah, right. They didn't respond to me. Thanks for nothing.

57:43.080 --> 57:55.120
Miss busters. What do you guys, what do you guys think? God damn. Sometimes I read a question.

57:55.120 --> 57:59.480
It's like two out of three of us are going to say something really bad and we're going

57:59.480 --> 58:05.840
to get in trouble. Okay. So I'll go ahead and say my, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, but

58:05.840 --> 58:12.120
I want to say there's no rush. Uh, I'll save it. Okay. May I think they probably just call,

58:12.120 --> 58:18.680
they just could say friends. Women are fucking adults. This is my, this is my friend. Janine.

58:18.680 --> 58:27.040
I like her. We go to the, no, what's the thing that we go to the righteous church together.

58:27.040 --> 58:41.040
We totally shred the Bible and make room for Skyro. This is taking forever. So many pages.

58:41.040 --> 58:46.360
There's nothing. Oh God. I think I, is it possible that just like a bros before hoes.

58:46.360 --> 58:53.440
Don't say that. Rather than O braids before O Hayes. Okay. Thank you. Cause everyone here

58:53.440 --> 59:00.680
is an idiot. I took Maria Bamford's pig Latin class. I know what you're saying. I wouldn't

59:00.680 --> 59:05.160
have yesterday, but now I know. Is it possible that bromance is not a term that anyone actually

59:05.160 --> 59:09.560
like self is self-referential? I don't know. I've never heard it in the wild. Yeah. Like

59:09.560 --> 59:16.200
no one's ever said that this is Jim. We're having a bromance. We are currently engaged

59:16.200 --> 59:21.840
in a bromance. Right. Cause it's a, it's a weird noun. If you could say like we're bro

59:21.840 --> 59:28.960
dating, that would be fine. We're bro talking. I don't want to come in, but he seems nice.

59:28.960 --> 59:33.320
He seems bro nice. He seems bro nice. And he did take me to a bro dinner. So, and then

59:33.320 --> 59:41.000
a Brodio. Can we just, can we just stop using that word? Can people just be friends? Cause

59:41.000 --> 59:45.920
it's 2012. Is that okay? Like, can we just be all ladies? What do you call your friends?

59:45.920 --> 59:52.680
What do you call no friends? You guys have friends? No one here. Jesus. Sisterwise. Sisterwise.

59:52.680 --> 59:59.640
I like that. Now that does mean something else. It seems familiar. That seems familiar.

59:59.640 --> 01:00:05.840
But I, I, yeah, why not? I, wow. That TV show is much different than I thought it was. I

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:11.760
have misunderstood. Sister buddies. It's just, it's just Cody and like four lady buds just

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:16.240
hanging out. Yeah. They live in the same house. They're lady buds. That's what they do. They're

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:20.480
all friends. That's actually what they have to tell the law. That's what they have to

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:24.720
tell Johnny. We're lady buds. Back off. Don't worry about it. Lady buds is actually not

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:29.760
bad. It's kind of close to the hit Jonathan Brandis film lady bugs. Yeah. It's some Jonathan

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:39.920
Brandis fans out here. Oh shit. Jonathan Brandis is here. Oh fuck. Okay. Now people at home

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:46.480
run back the tape and count off the seconds. Jonathan Brandis at 1001. You now know the

01:00:46.480 --> 01:01:02.320
exact speed at which Griffin's brain computates facts. Sequest. Sequest. Oh no. His little

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:14.320
librarian was just toddling through the show. Stop the world. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh no. Is

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:23.440
it almost over? Oh, oh Darwin. Um, DSV. That's the only room on the planet that that works.

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:29.920
Guys, I would be remiss if I did not tell you about Bunk. It is a television show also on

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:36.560
IFC this Friday at 10 30 right after comedy bang bang. It is a game show for improv comics who

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:42.640
perform crude stunts I imagine for inane prizes. It's got categories like whose crotch is hotter,

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:48.320
shame that puppy, give that bitch some arms, and un-stamp the tramp. This ain't your dad's comedy.

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:53.280
That was my own tagline. Do we want to do that thing that we talked about doing?

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:59.840
How much time? We got time? We got a little bit of time. You guys got anywhere to go? You actually do.

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:04.560
Sorry to break it to you. If you haven't checked out yet, please leave the room and go check out

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:09.280
now. We're gonna try to do a thing. Oh god. I'm so terrified. Seriously, this is our fifth live

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:12.640
show. We've never tried to do this thing before. We're gonna take live questions from the audience.

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:20.080
Wait, bro. Now hold on. Please, please wait. We're gonna. It's gotta disclaim some things. Okay.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:29.040
If you bum anybody out, I will savage you. That's my job. Email us if you have those.

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:34.080
We're not good at that shit, but if you have a problem like that, email us. This

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:39.760
probably isn't the best. Let's run through what we've hit so far. Puppy kicking. Keep that in mind.

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:46.080
Justin needs some courage. And I don't know. Just nothing. I don't know. Who's got a question?

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:50.800
And I want a real question. If you try to find our job, we want to split attention.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:57.440
We would have had some professionals up here. Oh my God. I'm so yes. Head on over to the mic and

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:00.880
we'll try to answer your question. We get some humming. Can we get the Jeopardy music from

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:08.400
everyone in the audience? No. Oh Jesus. The power I wield is amazing. Sounds like the Jeopardy

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:16.080
funeral dirge. Please introduce yourself. Hi, I'm Holly. Hi, Holly. Hello, Holly. Holly,

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:20.320
do you understand that no matter what we say, you shouldn't do any of it? I've heard the show.

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:27.760
Okay. How can we help? So we recently got a fourth cat. Okay. Just to round it out.

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:33.440
And people told us it was a mistake. We were like, well, if we have three cats, four cats,

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:38.480
it's not a big deal. And now you want to renege on the cat. Well, the problem is it's not the

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:46.080
fact that she is the fourth cat. She sucks. Yeah. I'm amazed that your logic is 50% of cats suck.

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:50.080
Right. But we had three really good cats. And so we were like, oh, let's get another cat.

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:55.120
Pushed her luck. Yeah. That's the thing. The law of averages beat us, but bit us in the ass.

01:03:55.120 --> 01:04:00.000
And now your cat bites you in the ass. Right. I think she would if given the opportunity.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Right. How long have you had the cat? Uh, maybe like two months now. Now,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:10.160
how close do you live to the railroad? Justin? Wait, he would have meant hobo cat.

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:16.880
This is actually, this is actually a joke that's been made in the house before where

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:22.480
we're going to pack her a little bindle. A little grease paint beard.

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:27.920
Is that Incredible Hulk walking away music? Perfect. What's the cat's name?

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:31.840
It's Margo. Oh man, that even sounds like an asshole.

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:38.960
She's named after Margo Tenenbaum from the Royal Tenenbaums. She kind of sucked too.

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:47.760
You can actually, you can train cats. Right. Like asshole in what way?

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:52.640
She, well, she's, she doesn't really like, she likes me. She doesn't like anybody else in the

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:57.840
house. She tends to sort of like hiss if you come near her. She, um, she poops places. Well,

01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:04.480
all cats poop. You didn't let me finish. She poops places she's not supposed to poop.

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:10.400
On the ceiling? What? How many litter boxes do you have?

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:14.000
Uh, we have to have five cause you have to have one for each cat plus one.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.160
What? Hold on. What? Yeah. No, that's the thing. You have to have one for each cat

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:22.400
plus an extra. For those of you at home, there are way too many people in this audience

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:28.560
nodding knowingly. Oh yeah, sure. She's exactly right. You got to have an extra cat shit box.

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:39.120
What is it? Okay. We're going to need you to firm up your question. Are you asking

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:42.560
how to guilt-free get rid of this cat? Well, I mean, we don't want to like,

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:47.600
you know, we're not going to like take her out, but like, you're not going to hire Tom Barringer.

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:55.520
Not Tom Barringer playing a part of something. Here's the problem. Here's the problem is that

01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:01.920
we can't give her away to people that we know because they know we've talked about the cat.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:10.800
You can't use Craigslist because a Craigslist user will turn them into a hat.

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:14.240
Actually, I don't even think you can get rid of pets on Craigslist. I think you can if you like,

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:19.920
if you're selling a microwave. Yeah. I've got a cat shaped microwave. Yeah. Yeah.

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:22.800
I have a Felix the cat toaster. Sell her as a magical cat.

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:28.480
I don't know any details on that plan. I'll have to workshop it with you later,

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:31.600
but magical cat is the way to go, I think. This cat talked once.

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:38.560
It said, fuck you. I'm not going to lie, this cat sucks. Do you care enough about this cat

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:42.480
that you want to keep it and try to work through these issues? We are cat counselors.

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:48.960
We feel bad because she's not very old. We're thinking maybe she'll chill out,

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:53.440
but then again, I'm tired of cleaning up cat poo. Yeah, and you'll have another 20 years.

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:57.360
My favorite line in the Tim McGraw song Live Like You're Dying is get rid of your cats if

01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:01.760
there are dicks to you. You shouldn't have to live another day with this cat. This is

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:08.320
the symbiotic relationship. It's not an asshole. You give it dry food. It's a pretty simple contract.

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:13.920
The cat's got to do one thing, not be a dick. Not be a dick. And your cat is violating your

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:20.080
sacred trust. I think, oh good, he looks at the audience judging their reactions. I think

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:27.360
you should try to work through it. I think just get a little extra love. You know what? Sometimes

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:35.600
that's a cry for help. Maybe your cat's just hurting inside. Yeah. Maybe it needs a papoose

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:41.920
to ride in. Maybe some- No, you can't picture that? Okay. You can picture a graduating puppy,

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:49.360
but not a cat papoose. Not a cat papoose? You guys are so close. Dr. Pussy's prescription is

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:57.120
some extra- No, but like the cat. My cat, some extra TLC. Let him watch TLC. Let him watch TLC.

01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:03.280
Thank you. Say yes to that. Thank you. That went fucking great. Okay. Who else has one?

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:08.800
All right. Right next to the mic there. You understand the terms of use, right? You understand

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:14.000
if you mess this up, I will savage you. Again, I can't make this clear enough. Go ahead. Don't

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:21.280
blow it. Don't blow it. Everyone's watching. This is being recorded. Hi. Hi. Hello. What you got?

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:31.440
Bring it. Let's dance. Step up. Step up three podcast. What are you into? Do you like to step

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:37.440
up movies? Where did we switch to seduction? I missed the turn. You look like you work out.

01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:47.440
Yay. Do you like the shins? Sorry. What's your question? Okay. What's the question?

01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:52.400
I have a friend. He's kind of a messy guy. It's the same space. Just say it to you.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.280
I'm going to very much assure you that this is not me. He's kind of a chubby guy. He doesn't

01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:05.920
keep great care of himself, but he's very nice. But the issue is that he doesn't seem to wash his

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:13.760
socks ever. So he'll come over to someone's house, take off his shoes, and then it just smells like

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:18.800
all hell broke loose. Okay. What is the nicest way to bring this up to him and tell him to wash his

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:22.880
socks? I'm sorry. What was your, we didn't catch your name? Oh, Patrick Foy. Patrick, you got to

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:32.080
wash his socks. A little trust exercise we used to play back at the commune. Wash socks? What the

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:36.080
fuck are you talking about? I don't know. It petered out at the end. Yeah, it petered out in

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:48.960
the middle. Let me say potty training runs. Come on. Have you considered that it's his shoes

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:53.040
and not the socks? Yeah, that makes a big difference in the context of the question.

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:56.960
He can't wash his shoes. It goes from being lazy to unfortunate. The reason I know it's

01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:02.000
his socks and not his shoes is that he takes off his shoes at the door, but the smell follows him.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:08.400
Okay. All right. Got to cut off his feet. That doesn't fix anything. The feet are still in the

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:24.400
room. What did you help? For those watching at home, I just did something funny. Why the

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:33.120
fuck is your friend taking his shoes off? Do you live in a dojo? He likes to get comfortable,

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:37.040
I guess. I don't know. Then he can buy some fucking comfortable. You can buy some Crocs.

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:43.360
Actually, no, those are porous. He needs to buy some comfortable shoes. No, you need to buy him

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:47.040
some comfy shoes. Yeah. That's a fucking great solution. What about slippers? That would be

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:51.040
great. Say, hey- Those still aren't going to hold the funk in like you want them to. Duct tape

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:59.440
slippers. I haven't flushed that out. Yeah. I would say buy him some slippers. Then when he says,

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:03.760
he can't get mad at you because you will tell him when you give him, your feet smell so bad

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:09.200
and I hate it and here are these slippers I got you. I got them at JCPenney if they don't fit.

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:13.440
Here's a gift receipt. Receipts in the bag. I have the real receipt, but I don't want you to know

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:19.040
how much I spent on them. If you return them, I guess you'll, damn it. Damn it. This plan is flawed.

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:24.880
Give receipts fucking suck. Why did you ask? I'm sorry. You asked about gift receipts, right?

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:28.640
What to do with them? How to get your gift receipt? It's easy. You just got to tell him

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:33.120
first that you got to push the button beforehand. Trust me, I work at Sears. You can't go back.

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:37.040
You have to do it beforehand to print it out with the receipt. Thank you. Next question.

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:44.960
Thank you so much, Patrick. Thanks, Patrick. All right. I think we got time for one more.

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:50.160
Maybe one more. Yeah, we got one right here. The gentleman in the max fun con t-shirt.

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:56.320
Hit me, Jake. I don't understand exactly what we need from you, right?

01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:59.840
I don't know if I understand many things, but okay. You're the one, aren't you?

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:03.600
Okay, go ahead. My name is Jacob.

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:14.560
Jukub, I think? Jukub. Hit me. Hit me. So I got a roommate last year and then when we signed a

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:21.840
year-long lease. Did you have a roommate shower? Okay, so go ahead. That's when you have a shower

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:31.920
with your roommate. Then yes. Let the man finish. He was my friend beforehand and after a year of

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:36.480
it, it's getting a little tenuous and now I'm getting to like two months left on the lease

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:41.600
and I have made secretive plans with another friend to go be roommates with that person.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:47.040
This is very America's Next Top Model. Thank you, ma'am.

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:53.440
I still haven't really told him this. I was planning. I was like,

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:57.840
after Max Fun Con, that's whenever I'll tell him. You'll come home with a new field of self-worth.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:00.560
Absolutely. I don't want to live with you no more.

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.840
I made a whole new network of friends. I don't need you.

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:11.760
This is such a great opportunity, Jukub. You've got to do the midnight move out.

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:14.960
He's got to wake up the next day and it'll be like a scene from Taken.

01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:19.760
The whole room is destroyed and he's looking for clues.

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:25.120
Listen to me, whoever took Jukub. I have a very particular set of skills.

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:28.640
Skills are making me a nightmare. I can make a delicious hot pocket.

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:32.400
He says my feet smell bad, but I don't believe it.

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:36.960
I'm not the best at dishwashing. Do you guys live together?

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.640
Because trust me, he's not going to be broken up about it.

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:50.160
Can you describe without going into too much detail?

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.080
Do like eight words. Whichever is funnier.

01:13:54.080 --> 01:14:00.800
What's he do that's so off-putting? Oh, I just found out he was kind of racist.

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:03.440
So I knew something a little tenuous.

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:09.040
This might be terrible, but I kind of assume a lot of white people,

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:12.160
especially white people whose last names are Thurmond, which is what his last name is.

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:14.240
He is actually a relative of Strom Thurmond.

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:19.600
Now who's racist, Jukub? Against Thurmond.

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:23.840
I always assume they're a little bit racist, but he's just kind of bad about it.

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:26.400
He used to be in such a nice neighborhood until the comments moved in.

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:31.680
He just throws her around a lot. So yeah, we watch NBA basketball and he'll

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:35.520
just say off-putting things, you know, and be like, oh, black people just making...

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:40.400
Oh, he'll reference black people? Oh, look, some black people.

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:43.600
Fuck this guy. Midnight move out.

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:49.040
I think the best thing for you to do is wait till midnight

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:53.120
on the whatever, the end of the month or whatever, and just put all your stuff in a truck.

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:56.720
Be very quiet. And make him wake up to an empty house.

01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:59.200
Is there any way you can do that and also make him help you move?

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:04.160
Like hypnotism tapes while he sleeves or something?

01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:08.720
Say, listen, I got a fucking great plan. Slip and slide through my bedroom.

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:13.280
There's only one thing I need to make this happen. Help me move to apartment on 10th street.

01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:20.160
I think that if he is really, you know, that bad, then part of your job as a parting gift is to have

01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:24.080
a post-mortem on the living. All right, I'm going to be moving out.

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:27.440
Oh, today, by the way. But before I do, let's run through some things.

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:30.080
You got to debrief him. You should know.

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:33.360
I mean, it is an opportunity for growth. It's not really your responsibility.

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:37.760
You've had to deal with the guy for this long. So it couldn't hurt to mention it to him.

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:43.840
I'm like, hey, you're kind of racist. And nobody likes that. So I'm moving.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:47.680
I have another friend. So I hope that helps.

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:49.120
Midnight Nubat is what I'm going with.

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:49.520
All right.

01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:52.720
See, at first I was going to say you got to tell him I had a time, but fuck that guy.

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:53.200
Yeah, fuck out.

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:54.240
He sucks.

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:54.960
Thank you, Jacob.

01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:01.040
Just playing this episode of the podcast. Fuck you, man. You suck. You racist.

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.880
Fuck you fucking racist. Jacob's out.

01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:04.640
I'm going to fucking kill you.

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:05.840
I won't do that.

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.840
Sorry, guys. This is my second screwdriver.

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:11.920
So let's stop the show.

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:13.440
Do you have any more questions?

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:16.240
I think we can, we can, hold on, hold on a second.

01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:18.640
I'll be here with you people. How's it going?

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:22.400
So I learned a lot. I had to open my class.

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:25.920
What's the deal, ladies and dudes?

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:26.400
You can stop.

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:26.880
Okay.

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:30.000
Yeah. So, Justin.

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:34.000
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to start the podcast.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.800
Ladies and gentlemen, this has been my brother, my brother and me.

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:38.160
And if I show up for the modern era.

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:38.880
Why are you so sad?

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:41.440
I'm just sad because everything's ending, you know?

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:42.800
Like this is the last thing that happens.

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:48.320
But we wanted to send you off in style.

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:52.640
As you know, we end every episode with a Yahoo answer.

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:59.040
This is so apropos because we are the final Yahoo answer of Max Funcom.

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.360
Wow, that's deep.

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:04.000
So if anything, this is a tribute to our final answer.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.200
It's a tribute to ourselves.

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:06.720
It's a tribute to everything.

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:07.600
Seriously, thanks.

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:08.320
Should we? Yeah.

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:11.600
Because we're just going to fucking thanks for letting us be here.

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:14.000
Thank you to Jesse and everybody for setting this up.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.640
This is, this is the coolest fucking thing ever.

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:22.320
And like a year and a half ago before we joined,

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:28.560
we went to the dinner on Thursday and I had people try to,

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.560
well, I went to the dinner because I'm prompt

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:32.720
and a good employee of Max Fun.

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:38.560
And I had people try to explain to me what the conference was going to be like.

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:42.080
And for those of you at home that did not attend the conference,

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:46.560
no explanation can do it justice of how amazing it is to be in a place

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:51.040
filled with 200 people that are pretty much exactly like you.

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:51.840
Just best friends.

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:55.120
Yeah, it's amazing and a great environment.

01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:56.880
So if you weren't able to make it out this year

01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:58.240
and you felt bad about it, that's good.

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.400
You should feel bad about it.

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:03.600
It's a weird school of parenting you're going with, but I'm into it.

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:04.640
I feel, I dig it.

01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:10.960
So we thought for our final goodbye to you guys,

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:14.240
we would read several Yahoo Answers.

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:29.760
These final Yahoo Answers were sent in by Vanessa Williams.

01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:32.240
This is orange juice, not pee on my pants.

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:45.120
Why is Bruce Willis bald?

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:57.680
It turns out that guy in Miami who was eating the other guy's face was a conservative.

01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:03.120
No surprise there.

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:04.640
How much does a pyramid cost?

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:14.640
If you're in a car crash with a girl,

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:17.600
is it still okay to ask her to the prom when her legs heal?

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:25.760
My son didn't eat his potato salad.

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:31.440
Is he gay?

01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:34.240
How am I sure that I'm the real mom of my kid?

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:37.840
Think about it.

01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:42.800
Is Kelly Clarkson a virgin?

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:49.440
Does anybody still use this term in everyday conversation?

01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:59.040
Well, now, during sexual intercourse, do you put the balls in?

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:13.040
Is it okay to defrost chicken in a pool?

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:27.760
Still, I feel interest for Indian moms.

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:28.960
I want to talk to them.

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:31.600
Is there anyone to share my exact feelings, please?

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:38.880
Are there dogs in the new Batman movie?

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:43.680
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:44.720
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:45.520
I'm Kevin McElroy.

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:49.200
Remember, remember, let me kiss your dad's small lips.

01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:50.720
James, where are you?

01:20:50.720 --> 01:21:04.160
Come back, everyone.

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:21.440
Thank you very, very much.
