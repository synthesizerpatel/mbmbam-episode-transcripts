00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.080
Hi everybody, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, the advice show for the modern era. I'm

00:48.080 --> 00:52.400
your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.400 --> 00:56.240
I'm your sweet, sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:56.240 --> 00:58.400
Now baby brother, you're sitting next to me.

00:58.400 --> 01:02.240
That's it. We're just sitting next to each other. I'm looking at you. I feel you.

01:02.240 --> 01:06.880
I'm looking at you drink this devastating cocktail I watched you make in the kitchen for yourself.

01:08.880 --> 01:12.640
Justin, that's the grossest thing I've maybe ever seen anybody put into a cup.

01:12.640 --> 01:15.040
It's mainly milk and also coffee.

01:15.040 --> 01:18.720
The sign of a great cocktail is it's mostly milk.

01:18.720 --> 01:23.520
It's mostly milk and coffee and liquor. It's called... How's my bathroom today?

01:25.520 --> 01:28.000
It's called Minority Bathroom Report.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.880
It's called I just downloaded that new Jurassic World game on my iPhone. I really want to get deep.

01:32.880 --> 01:36.560
Here comes a red ball from the precogs. It says you're going to kill your bath.

01:36.560 --> 01:40.560
You're in town for your high school reunion, Griffin, your 10-year reunion.

01:40.560 --> 01:42.080
My 10th, yeah, my decade.

01:42.080 --> 01:44.080
That's the most important one, as we all know.

01:44.080 --> 01:47.520
Here is the question, I think, on everybody's mind.

01:48.320 --> 01:52.160
Were the people there at the reunion impressed enough

01:53.440 --> 01:55.680
by the fact that you had a popular podcast?

01:55.680 --> 01:59.200
Oh, man, let me tell you. No, not really.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.000
Not really.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.800
I mean, what's enough? What would it be? What would be... Are we looking for...

02:02.800 --> 02:06.240
I'm looking for like a Rudy, put you on your shoulder, carry you...

02:06.240 --> 02:09.680
I was not lifted. I was not... I was not carried. I was not heralded.

02:09.680 --> 02:15.440
My buddy, Alex, tried to get the hype going. He tried to get that train a-rollin'.

02:15.440 --> 02:19.840
He was like, this dude had a day named after him last year.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.600
I was like, well, that's not entirely accurate. It was...

02:21.600 --> 02:25.040
Did you buy a round for the bar and say, don't worry, this one's on Totino's?

02:25.040 --> 02:28.240
No, my friend, my old buddy, Derek, bought a round for the bar.

02:28.240 --> 02:31.680
And then he got concerned that not everybody was cashing in on his offer,

02:31.680 --> 02:35.760
which I get. If you go out and say, hey, everyone, this next one's on me.

02:35.760 --> 02:38.400
And then there are people who don't get one on you.

02:39.200 --> 02:43.840
Well, some of those people, the big worry is that they're planning on saving it.

02:43.840 --> 02:47.920
They'll come back to the bar in a few weeks and say, I think I should have a one that Derek...

02:47.920 --> 02:51.360
I believe Derek has an IOU for a one on him.

02:51.360 --> 02:55.280
I feel the exact opposite of how I imagine Derek must have felt.

02:55.280 --> 03:01.280
If I said a round on the bar on me and everyone went, oh, that's all right,

03:01.280 --> 03:05.520
I would be so relieved because I would have gotten them with the gesture, but like...

03:05.520 --> 03:09.200
I'd like to say that when I'm the only one in the bar.

03:09.200 --> 03:12.960
Yeah, but then it's like, ha ha ha ha, and everybody laughs,

03:12.960 --> 03:15.360
but it's just me laughing, and then I get a little sad.

03:15.360 --> 03:15.920
Yeah.

03:15.920 --> 03:17.520
What about this move?

03:17.520 --> 03:22.560
Next one that the next person orders is on me, and then you just watch them fight for your love.

03:22.560 --> 03:26.560
The 11th caller gets a free drink, and here's my phone number.

03:26.560 --> 03:30.240
Everybody just start calling me and friend me on Facebook.

03:30.240 --> 03:36.400
I was hoping for like a 10-year review from you guys of how I've been doing

03:37.280 --> 03:40.240
since 2005 when I graduated high school.

03:40.240 --> 03:41.680
Well, we hit the podcast.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.080
We did the podcast, and that's been really good.

03:44.080 --> 03:45.120
You got married, right?

03:45.120 --> 03:46.400
Right.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.120
I got married.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.840
It doesn't just have to be life events.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.320
Just how has my performance been?

03:52.880 --> 03:53.520
How am I...

03:53.520 --> 03:54.800
What about my physique?

03:54.800 --> 03:55.920
I felt different.

03:55.920 --> 03:57.600
Has my physique changed since 2005?

03:57.600 --> 04:02.880
I felt that around year five, it really started to kind of wane a little bit.

04:02.880 --> 04:04.560
Yeah, he had peaked.

04:04.560 --> 04:07.680
Wait, which element of my persona are you even talking about?

04:07.680 --> 04:08.480
Your performance.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.760
Just like your overall...

04:11.760 --> 04:16.960
I can't lift as much weight over my head.

04:16.960 --> 04:21.600
Your lifting, your health, your vim, your vigor.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.600
All my stats, all my statistics.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.720
I mean, you haven't been getting as many RBIs.

04:26.720 --> 04:28.240
Your fielding is weak.

04:28.240 --> 04:33.600
Dad used to call those ribbies, and I thought it was just like pretty standard.

04:33.600 --> 04:38.720
So I had a few incidents in my mid-20s where I'd be at a bar before watching baseball,

04:38.720 --> 04:41.760
and I would say like, hey, nice RB or something.

04:41.760 --> 04:45.600
It's weird to find out that there was something about sports that you didn't know, Justin.

04:45.600 --> 04:46.400
Yeah, it's weird.

04:46.400 --> 04:50.960
I'm certainly not scoring as many home runs as I once did, or home alone as I call them.

04:52.640 --> 04:56.640
Can I tell you guys in the last decade how many home alone's I've pulled down?

04:57.920 --> 04:58.560
None of them.

04:59.440 --> 05:01.920
This is a comedy advice show where we...

05:02.560 --> 05:04.320
I want you to fucking lay it on me.

05:04.320 --> 05:09.920
I'm not going to get any better if you guys don't tell me what needs improvement.

05:09.920 --> 05:13.280
I want you to beat me into the ground or else I'll never become the world's greatest drummer

05:13.280 --> 05:15.120
or home run getter or whatever I try.

05:15.120 --> 05:17.200
Oh, you want me to whiplash you?

05:17.200 --> 05:18.400
I want you to whiplash me.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.120
No, no, that's not my beat.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.320
That's not my beat, Griffin.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.040
You're not supposed to say mean things about me while I do drums.

05:25.040 --> 05:27.840
You smell like butts, and you're not doing a great job.

05:29.280 --> 05:30.800
Tear my shit apart.

05:31.360 --> 05:32.400
I'm not going to get...

05:32.400 --> 05:36.480
When I'm 38 years old, I don't want to be the same as I am right now,

05:36.480 --> 05:38.480
but that is sort of the direction that you're pushing me.

05:38.480 --> 05:39.360
Good job, Griffin.

05:39.360 --> 05:39.920
Stay the same.

05:39.920 --> 05:41.040
You are a 10 out of 10.

05:41.040 --> 05:41.760
I wouldn't change a thing.

05:41.760 --> 05:42.560
Can I say that though?

05:42.560 --> 05:49.120
Like if you could stay the same, like if you could aim for that in 10 years,

05:50.400 --> 05:52.560
I think you will be far ahead of the curve.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.880
Yeah, I mean, maintaining is...

05:54.880 --> 05:56.480
Like if you could just maintain.

05:57.360 --> 05:58.720
I just want to increase my jump height.

05:58.720 --> 06:02.080
If I'm the same, but I can increase my vertical leap by seven inches.

06:02.080 --> 06:05.040
That's going to be great because you're going to spend the entire reunion

06:05.040 --> 06:08.480
trying to find a reason to jump super high.

06:08.480 --> 06:13.600
Not just to jump super high, but to jump super high in a context in which

06:13.600 --> 06:16.880
people would need to measure the inches and compare them.

06:16.880 --> 06:17.440
And compare it.

06:17.440 --> 06:21.040
See, that's one problem is I didn't jump high last night.

06:21.040 --> 06:25.200
Here's what you need to do right now on the Facebook page of your reunion.

06:25.200 --> 06:30.000
You need to say, in case anybody missed it, I did clock in at six vertical inches.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.320
People are posting pictures already in that Facebook group.

06:32.320 --> 06:35.680
I need to hop in and be like, oh, this was right before I jumped 36 inches.

06:35.680 --> 06:37.200
No, you've got to improve.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.040
You don't want to be 36 inches right now.

06:39.040 --> 06:40.400
You want to have good growth.

06:41.920 --> 06:47.200
How every day post like a three second video of you jumping next to a ruler

06:47.200 --> 06:50.720
and just like every day chart like how much you go up.

06:50.720 --> 06:53.920
Or maybe like there's a day where it's like, oh, that was like a half inch down.

06:53.920 --> 06:54.640
What happened?

06:54.640 --> 06:58.720
And like you ate a big burrito and we can like chart it over the next 10 years.

06:58.720 --> 07:01.200
Then we'll end up being 3650.

07:01.200 --> 07:05.280
You are you are like treacherously close to up worthy territory right now.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.520
This man measured his vertical leap every day for 10 years.

07:09.520 --> 07:11.120
And you won't believe what happens next.

07:11.120 --> 07:11.680
Nothing.

07:11.680 --> 07:12.160
Nothing.

07:12.160 --> 07:14.160
It's the same 36 inches.

07:14.160 --> 07:15.840
That doesn't seem like that's three feet.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.520
That doesn't seem like very.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.160
Is that good?

07:18.160 --> 07:19.120
That would actually be insane.

07:19.120 --> 07:19.840
You can delete.

07:22.480 --> 07:23.360
Stop.

07:23.360 --> 07:28.880
Are you telling me if you could leap three feet straight up on the ground,

07:28.880 --> 07:30.240
you wouldn't be impressed.

07:30.240 --> 07:30.800
OK, hold on.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.480
I want to get some sort of ballpark here.

07:34.400 --> 07:35.520
Oh, my legs.

07:35.520 --> 07:35.760
Stop.

07:35.760 --> 07:36.640
My baby's sleeping.

07:36.640 --> 07:37.680
Don't do this anymore.

07:37.680 --> 07:39.200
Let's read the first question.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.880
We don't need another 259.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.680
OK, it looked like about 18 inches.

07:44.720 --> 07:45.680
I just got to double that.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.000
Should we get into the advice?

07:48.000 --> 07:51.200
Yeah, my birthday is coming up and I'm having a dope party.

07:51.200 --> 07:54.800
Oh, call the cops.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.880
Casually seeing a couple of dudes right now.

07:56.880 --> 08:01.200
And I'm pretty sure they all know of this impending natal anniversary.

08:01.200 --> 08:03.840
But I'm not sure who, if any of them to invite.

08:03.840 --> 08:04.640
What do I do?

08:05.520 --> 08:07.840
Too many suitors in there.

08:07.840 --> 08:12.080
I kind of feel like you would invite none of them because I feel like if you're planning

08:12.080 --> 08:15.680
a party like you already are going to have so much to think about.

08:15.680 --> 08:21.280
You don't want like a new romance to sort of distract you from just sort of enjoying

08:21.280 --> 08:22.960
the party with people you're super comfortable with.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.880
Now, Justin, may I counterpoint?

08:24.880 --> 08:26.960
You invite all of you first.

08:26.960 --> 08:33.280
And now this way, what you've done is you've guaranteed an interesting evening.

08:33.280 --> 08:38.080
Kind of your Flintstones, like you want to go to the bowling league, but you also have

08:38.080 --> 08:39.200
Pebble's birthday.

08:39.200 --> 08:43.680
OK, but Fred didn't do that shit to make it sexy.

08:43.680 --> 08:45.280
Like he didn't try and sex his life out.

08:45.280 --> 08:46.400
How do you know that, Griffin?

08:46.400 --> 08:47.360
That was out of necessity.

08:47.360 --> 08:51.440
His and Barney's relationship had grown a bit stale and they wanted to like have adventurous

08:51.440 --> 08:52.160
friendships.

08:52.160 --> 08:55.600
I want to add a little bit of flavor to this equation.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.240
Hey, Fred, don't you think things are getting a little stale?

08:59.920 --> 09:00.960
Get your dick out.

09:00.960 --> 09:03.360
When was the last time you fought me for the pebbles?

09:03.360 --> 09:04.640
For the fruity pebbles?

09:04.640 --> 09:05.200
Here's the question.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.080
It's weird.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.120
Isn't it weird?

09:07.120 --> 09:08.240
Wait, hold on.

09:08.240 --> 09:11.360
Isn't it weird that Bar- I've never thought of it.

09:11.360 --> 09:15.200
Barney was trying to steal a cereal from Fred named after his daughter.

09:16.320 --> 09:17.920
I'm going to gobble your pebbles.

09:17.920 --> 09:18.480
Stop it.

09:18.480 --> 09:19.280
What are you talking about?

09:19.280 --> 09:20.480
You're going to gobble my pebbles.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.560
I want a spoonful of pebbles.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.160
Get out of here, you fucking weirdo.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.720
I want to take a big bite of Bam Bam.

09:27.440 --> 09:28.400
Yeah, how's that?

09:28.400 --> 09:29.280
How's that feel?

09:29.280 --> 09:30.320
How's that feel to you?

09:30.320 --> 09:31.440
Bam Bam had a cereal.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.600
Things like peanut butter bowl or something.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.520
I'd love to have one night with Wilma.

09:36.320 --> 09:38.080
For one million clams.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.800
One night with Wilma is a lot of-

09:40.800 --> 09:42.800
General Mills made a series called One Night with Wilma.

09:42.800 --> 09:48.400
We made a sex tape with a particularly loquacious Velociraptor.

09:48.400 --> 09:50.400
He watched us and then we recorded it.

09:50.400 --> 09:51.120
It's a living.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.920
He had a pterodactyl make an audio recording.

09:53.920 --> 09:54.720
It's a living.

09:56.080 --> 10:00.320
Do all the fellows, along with knowing about your birthday,

10:00.320 --> 10:04.480
do they know that you're seeing multiple dudes or are you doing this on the DL?

10:04.480 --> 10:07.120
If they were all at the party together, would they be like,

10:07.120 --> 10:09.040
why are you smooching on Steve?

10:09.760 --> 10:13.840
It doesn't matter if they're doing it on the HL or on the DL Hugely.

10:13.840 --> 10:17.200
If it's casual, it doesn't sound like they give a shit.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.400
Like they mean, hey, I'm Bryce.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.360
Hey, I'm Todd.

10:19.360 --> 10:23.600
I'm with Roseanne.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.160
Yeah, me too.

10:24.160 --> 10:25.120
I'm with Roseanne.

10:25.120 --> 10:25.600
Cool.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.360
It's casual.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.320
I watch Roseanne.

10:28.320 --> 10:29.680
Yeah, I also watch Roseanne.

10:29.680 --> 10:30.640
I also watch Roseanne.

10:30.640 --> 10:31.360
You suck.

10:31.360 --> 10:32.000
You suck.

10:32.000 --> 10:32.560
You suck.

10:32.560 --> 10:33.120
You suck.

10:33.120 --> 10:35.040
I also watch Roseanne. You son of a bitch.

10:35.040 --> 10:36.000
That's my thing.

10:36.000 --> 10:36.960
Now we're going to fight.

10:36.960 --> 10:38.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:38.400 --> 10:43.120
What if the party ends with like, listen, me and Bryson got to talking

10:43.120 --> 10:47.440
and we're going to give you a birthday present to remember.

10:47.440 --> 10:49.120
We're all going to watch Roseanne together.

10:50.160 --> 10:54.880
Well, we're going to like just both pleasure you all night long.

10:55.680 --> 10:56.240
Think about that.

10:56.240 --> 11:01.280
Thanks for saving this energy until I was in the room with you.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.120
Yeah, but think about it.

11:03.120 --> 11:03.760
Yeah, no, I'm-

11:03.760 --> 11:07.280
No, I think this is fine playback considering on another podcast we record,

11:07.280 --> 11:10.880
I had to listen to our father two inches from my face.

11:10.880 --> 11:11.360
Yeah.

11:11.360 --> 11:14.560
Fucking R. Kelly dirty talk some plants.

11:14.560 --> 11:15.120
Yeah.

11:15.120 --> 11:16.320
I think this is fair playback.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.560
Adventures on episode 18.

11:18.560 --> 11:21.680
What if they decide, what if they fulfill your fantasy of like they,

11:21.680 --> 11:24.400
one of them dresses like Jacob and one of them dresses like Edward

11:24.400 --> 11:25.920
and they fight over your loves.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.680
A birthday fantasy just for you.

11:27.680 --> 11:30.160
Or one of them dresses like Jacob and the other one dresses like

11:30.160 --> 11:34.160
the other god-like character from Lost and they compete for your soul.

11:34.880 --> 11:38.160
One of them dresses like Jacob Marley and the other one dresses like Scrooge.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.040
Fantasy coming to life.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.680
If you can think of other Jacobs, send us a text.

11:43.680 --> 11:44.800
Text us right now.

11:44.800 --> 11:48.880
Jacob to 414141.

11:48.880 --> 11:51.360
One of you is Jacob Marley, one of you is Ziggy Marley.

11:52.160 --> 11:55.440
And one of you is Dweezil Zappa, but you actually are Dweezil Zappa.

11:56.960 --> 11:58.800
This question is from Dweezil Zappa.

11:58.800 --> 12:01.920
I'm seeing a couple of guys and also Dweezil Zappa.

12:01.920 --> 12:05.600
And it's weird, like Dweezil knows about it, but the other two don't know about Dweezil.

12:06.240 --> 12:09.360
And I've got a sack of flour and a chicken and a wolf.

12:09.360 --> 12:13.360
I need to get all six of them across the river, but I've only got one raft.

12:13.360 --> 12:16.400
And Dweezil Zappa is going to eat all the flour if I leave him alone with it.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.320
But the chicken will eat Dweezil Zappa.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Also Dweezil Zappa won't get on the raft.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.920
So that seems like, that seems like it's just sort of going to screw them over.

12:25.920 --> 12:27.920
Dweezil Zappa just like fool me once.

12:27.920 --> 12:28.160
No.

12:28.160 --> 12:29.040
He won't get on the raft.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.480
I've been hurt on rafts before.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.640
Not falling for another raft scheme.

12:32.640 --> 12:33.760
How about a yahoo?

12:33.760 --> 12:34.000
Yep.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.920
This yahoo is sent in by Zoe Kinski climbing that ladder.

12:38.960 --> 12:44.720
It's by yahoo answers user Christina R93, who asks,

12:46.320 --> 12:51.680
if people are having sex during an earthquake, do they still have to move?

12:53.360 --> 12:56.320
My friends and I were joking around and this question popped up.

12:56.320 --> 12:58.240
There is no wrong or right answer.

12:58.240 --> 12:58.800
There is.

12:58.800 --> 13:02.160
I don't know why you got so zen like about it so quickly.

13:02.960 --> 13:05.520
Just to see what kind of answers there are.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.200
Opinions are greatly encouraged.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.960
Well, opinions are basically probably always.

13:08.960 --> 13:13.200
Opinions as opposed to scientific like study theories.

13:13.920 --> 13:14.400
Yeah.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.800
You got a control group with placebo effect.

13:16.800 --> 13:18.960
You just thought there was an earthquake, but you were fucking.

13:18.960 --> 13:22.400
So let me, this might get a little blue.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.280
This is the picture that they're painting, right?

13:25.280 --> 13:26.320
There's two people.

13:26.320 --> 13:32.000
They begin lovemaking and then an earthquake starts and then they go.

13:32.800 --> 13:33.520
Whew.

13:33.520 --> 13:34.320
Thank God.

13:34.320 --> 13:42.160
And then just relax every muscle simultaneously and let the earth do the work.

13:42.880 --> 13:46.080
That's actually the safest thing to do in the middle of an earthquake.

13:46.080 --> 13:47.280
Just relax all your muscles.

13:47.280 --> 13:56.320
And let go jelly bones and just let your member jiggle and wiggle and rigor,

13:56.320 --> 13:59.920
wriggle and wriggle and wiggle and rigor.

13:59.920 --> 14:03.440
Just let your bed just go to town all on their own.

14:03.440 --> 14:03.840
You know what?

14:03.840 --> 14:05.040
You've had a hard day.

14:05.040 --> 14:06.880
You put in the work down the office.

14:06.880 --> 14:10.640
Now it's time for the earth to make your bits move so that you don't have to.

14:11.360 --> 14:15.760
What if you instantly fetishize it and then it ruins your love life because

14:15.760 --> 14:21.760
it's unpredictable when you'll be able to climax.

14:21.760 --> 14:22.480
All right.

14:22.480 --> 14:25.120
That was holy, holy unpleasant for me.

14:25.120 --> 14:27.440
Your foot has got to get back into the DMZ.

14:27.440 --> 14:30.080
I'm sitting in the fucking splash zone of justice.

14:30.080 --> 14:31.280
You need to move your foot.

14:31.280 --> 14:35.120
I've touched it twice now and I hate, I hate, we started,

14:35.120 --> 14:38.880
I tell people we started doing this podcast because we weren't communicating

14:38.880 --> 14:40.320
with each other enough and I missed you guys.

14:40.320 --> 14:41.840
That's 100% true.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.040
I hate doing this.

14:43.040 --> 14:44.000
It's the same room as you.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.200
It is miserable.

14:45.200 --> 14:48.880
I mean, when Griffin and I started recording, we still recorded from our separate bedrooms.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.600
We were in the same apartment, two rooms apart.

14:51.600 --> 14:56.560
We have to go into some places that require me to be rather free with my own sort of

14:56.560 --> 14:59.200
psyche and sexuality, just like removing all the barriers.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.240
Even as I'm saying that sentence, you're looking at me as I'm saying,

15:05.840 --> 15:07.520
just stare straight ahead.

15:07.520 --> 15:08.400
That would be excellent.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.640
I'm just going to look at this grub hoe ad you had pulled up.

15:10.640 --> 15:12.480
I'm just going to stare a hole through that.

15:12.480 --> 15:18.480
Um, there are people, there are probably people who are tectonic sexual, right?

15:20.320 --> 15:22.720
Do you think after that New Yorker piece came out, they were like,

15:22.720 --> 15:29.920
we have to get up in the Pacific Northwest and get, just stay hard 24 seven,

15:29.920 --> 15:32.560
I guess, just waiting for the big one.

15:32.560 --> 15:33.440
Oh man.

15:33.440 --> 15:37.120
Cause it's going to be, according to that article, it's going to be like three uninterrupted minutes.

15:37.120 --> 15:39.680
That's going to feel so good.

15:39.680 --> 15:41.920
Oh, you guys, this explains why I win.

15:41.920 --> 15:43.680
I went to see San Andreas.

15:43.680 --> 15:46.960
There was like one other person in there who just kept winking at me.

15:47.760 --> 15:48.320
I get it.

15:48.320 --> 15:48.960
That was The Rock.

15:48.960 --> 15:50.000
That was, that was Dwayne.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.600
That was The Rock, the Dwayne Johnson.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.440
Known tectosexual.

15:53.440 --> 15:54.560
He was saying, thanks.

15:54.560 --> 15:55.360
Yeah, I made it.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.640
I made this one for free.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.400
This one was for Dwayne.

15:58.960 --> 16:03.680
What if The Rock did show up at screenings of his movies that he just went from person to person

16:03.680 --> 16:05.440
like, excuse me, excuse me.

16:05.440 --> 16:06.400
It's me, The Rock.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.080
Um, how are you enjoying the picture?

16:09.120 --> 16:11.440
Is there anything I can improve on next time?

16:11.440 --> 16:11.760
Thanks.

16:12.480 --> 16:15.360
Here's a, here's a coupon for Wendy's.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.040
Thanks for taking this brief survey.

16:18.160 --> 16:20.160
I got this coupon the last time I went.

16:20.160 --> 16:21.760
I'm never going to use it.

16:21.760 --> 16:23.120
The Rock is Dave Thomas.

16:23.120 --> 16:23.680
Did you know that?

16:23.680 --> 16:23.920
Yeah.

16:25.040 --> 16:26.320
I read about it on the blogs.

16:26.880 --> 16:27.920
He looks really good.

16:29.040 --> 16:33.600
I recently went to a wedding in which I bought a few gifts off the registry for the soon-to-be

16:33.600 --> 16:34.800
married couple, as you do.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.120
Oh, it's a quick sidebar.

16:37.120 --> 16:42.320
Do you guys ever have a set amount in mind that you want to spend on a gift registry?

16:42.320 --> 16:44.720
And the things that are about that price are already taken.

16:44.720 --> 16:48.640
So you end up buying like five really terrible things just to get to that dollar amount.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.880
I got you some napkins and some napkins.

16:50.880 --> 16:53.680
There's four forks you wanted and these cups.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.360
I got you one piece of the crystalware set.

16:55.360 --> 16:57.120
Hopefully somebody else is going to swoop in there.

16:57.120 --> 16:57.680
I hope it.

16:57.680 --> 17:02.320
Anyway, the issue being here is that within three months they'd already filed for divorce

17:02.320 --> 17:05.200
and were officially divorced shortly thereafter.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.840
Is there a time limit or protocol for returning gifts?

17:07.840 --> 17:08.480
Wait, what?

17:08.480 --> 17:13.040
I don't believe that a marriage doesn't extend beyond six months or possibly should be able

17:13.040 --> 17:16.000
to keep the thousands in cash and gifts they receive.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.400
That's from malevolent matrimony in Milwaukee.

17:18.400 --> 17:21.440
What the fuck are you talking about?

17:23.120 --> 17:25.360
You know that Seinfeld's off the air, right?

17:25.360 --> 17:26.640
You don't have to pitch episodes.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.160
What are you talking about?

17:28.720 --> 17:30.800
Give me my stemware back.

17:30.800 --> 17:31.920
What are you talking about?

17:31.920 --> 17:32.800
I have the answer.

17:32.800 --> 17:35.120
There's no answer required.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.800
This isn't a thing.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.160
I've got the answer, Griffin.

17:38.160 --> 17:39.120
I've got the answer.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.160
Please let me give the answer.

17:40.160 --> 17:40.960
Please.

17:40.960 --> 17:41.520
Yeah, please.

17:41.520 --> 17:42.240
I want it now.

17:42.240 --> 17:46.080
The answer is the same amount of time that the government requires that a couple stay

17:46.080 --> 17:48.000
married in green card cases.

17:49.440 --> 17:51.120
I don't know how long that is, mind you.

17:51.120 --> 17:52.800
Get federal on this.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.240
You don't know how long it is.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.200
But however long.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.520
Somebody do a quick doodle.

17:57.520 --> 18:00.240
As many times as you've watched the film Green Card?

18:00.240 --> 18:05.120
As many times as you spent your life remembering the episodes of Wings in which Helen married

18:05.120 --> 18:09.440
Antonio Scarpacci for his green card and then they eventually got divorced.

18:09.440 --> 18:12.480
But oh, no, he didn't actually turn in the paperwork.

18:12.480 --> 18:16.960
So then she wasn't able to marry Timothy Daly's character whose name was.

18:19.120 --> 18:24.480
You remembered so much about you remembered so much about the Wings story arc, but not

18:24.480 --> 18:26.400
the name of one of the main characters.

18:26.400 --> 18:27.440
What's his name?

18:27.440 --> 18:29.120
I think his name was Pilotson.

18:29.120 --> 18:31.440
Brian was his brother.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.360
I think it was Mark Pilotson.

18:33.360 --> 18:36.080
I remember Roy, I remember Roy.

18:36.080 --> 18:38.640
How do I not remember Tim Daly's character?

18:38.640 --> 18:42.000
Nobody's going to remember this story arc of my brother, my brother and me, because

18:42.000 --> 18:45.680
they're going to stop listening, thinking about remembering and talking about the podcast

18:45.680 --> 18:46.080
after this.

18:46.080 --> 18:46.640
I remember Helen.

18:46.640 --> 18:48.720
Helen had a sister who was Amy Yazbeck.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.160
OK, you guys check back in with me.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.400
Man, I had this whole thing.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.400
Lied about Wings.

18:56.400 --> 19:00.240
No, about Green Card, and I was going to say, like, you always talk about what a big

19:00.240 --> 19:00.640
Def R.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.760
Dude you are and what a big fan of his.

19:03.760 --> 19:05.760
And then I didn't get to say it because you are this stupid.

19:05.760 --> 19:06.160
Oh, but wait.

19:06.160 --> 19:06.720
Oh, but wait.

19:07.600 --> 19:08.480
You just did.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.160
I just got it in, I guess.

19:10.160 --> 19:11.360
If Travis wants to.

19:11.360 --> 19:14.400
Anybody else have any things that they wanted to say during the episode, but like somebody

19:14.400 --> 19:15.920
else cut them off and then just like.

19:17.120 --> 19:20.000
But I'm really enjoying Travis's new bit, shitty Wikipedia.

19:22.320 --> 19:25.360
Tim Daly played, I don't know, whatever, something.

19:25.360 --> 19:26.800
Oh, I'm OK.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.440
Like, I'm staring at Tim D.B. page.

19:29.440 --> 19:31.920
OK, we're done with the episode.

19:31.920 --> 19:35.280
This Yahoo answer that I'm going to read to you now is sent in by Drew Davenport.

19:35.280 --> 19:35.840
Thank you.

19:35.840 --> 19:37.840
Ya Drew Drew at Drew Davenport.

19:37.840 --> 19:39.040
Joe is his name.

19:39.040 --> 19:39.600
Thank you.

19:39.600 --> 19:40.080
Thank you.

19:40.080 --> 19:40.720
Slam dunk.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.320
Three pointer from the half court line.

19:42.960 --> 19:43.760
He's a large man.

19:43.760 --> 19:44.240
All right.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.680
What is at the bottom of my glass?

19:46.400 --> 19:48.720
Can you give me that Sharpie so I can stir this up a little bit?

19:50.720 --> 19:52.880
Is this what it's like for you when, like, nobody else is?

19:52.880 --> 19:54.160
Or is this the you you are?

19:54.160 --> 19:56.160
It's a whole carnival, man.

19:56.160 --> 19:57.280
You're drinking a milk.

19:57.280 --> 20:02.080
You're drinking a tall glass of milk booze and you're still in that beach life.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.160
Oh, he just sucked that.

20:04.160 --> 20:06.240
He just sucked the booze off the Sharpie.

20:06.240 --> 20:10.240
He just put the Sharpie in his mouth and got the five characters from Cheers.

20:10.240 --> 20:16.400
Norm, Cliff, Frazier, Lilith and Rebecca made appearances on Wings, but no characters from

20:16.400 --> 20:22.080
Wings crossed over to any Cheers episodes, though Thomas Hayden Church, who played Lowell,

20:22.080 --> 20:26.640
played an unrelated character on a Cheers episode prior to being cast on Wings.

20:27.280 --> 20:28.880
All of this is getting cut out of the show.

20:28.880 --> 20:31.760
Let me please, please, let's ask another question, please.

20:32.720 --> 20:37.600
This Yahoo Answers is by Yahoo Answer user, Jackie, who asks,

20:37.600 --> 20:39.200
I have only been a massage therapist.

20:39.200 --> 20:39.840
What are you doing?

20:39.840 --> 20:40.720
I'm reading the Yahoo.

20:40.720 --> 20:41.440
Are you drunk?

20:41.440 --> 20:42.160
No, are you?

20:43.520 --> 20:44.000
All right.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.440
Let's get this thing back on track, guys.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.440
This Yahoo Answers by Yahoo Answers user, Jackie, who asks,

20:49.440 --> 20:51.600
Puzzle of the Muscles?

20:51.600 --> 20:52.800
Do you want to read it?

20:52.800 --> 20:53.280
What?

20:53.280 --> 20:54.320
Do you want to read it?

20:54.320 --> 20:55.360
No, I don't want to read it.

20:56.160 --> 20:57.120
Why do you think I want to read it?

20:57.120 --> 20:58.160
Because you tried to.

20:58.160 --> 21:00.480
Well, I just got confused about what we were doing.

21:00.480 --> 21:02.800
I don't usually see them in front of me.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.880
If I see a question, I just read it.

21:04.880 --> 21:05.760
You just let it rip.

21:06.240 --> 21:07.040
Travis.

21:07.040 --> 21:07.600
Yes?

21:08.960 --> 21:10.800
Do you remember the theme song to Wings?

21:10.800 --> 21:16.480
I think it was like, boo-doo-boo, wings, wings, boo-doo-doo-doo, wings, wings, boo-doo-doo-doo,

21:16.480 --> 21:17.680
wings, wings, boo-doo-doo-doo.

21:17.680 --> 21:23.040
Wings, wings, boo-doo-doo-doo, wings, wings, boo-doo-doo-doo-doo, wings, wings, boo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

21:23.040 --> 21:26.880
Brothers, brothers, flying planes, doodly-doodly-do.

21:26.880 --> 21:31.200
I think there's a murder mystery episode this one time.

21:31.200 --> 21:34.240
Tony Shalhoub went on to do the show Monk.

21:35.600 --> 21:38.400
If I remember correctly, I don't have the lyrics in front of me.

21:38.400 --> 21:48.480
Wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings.

21:48.480 --> 21:52.800
Planes going to China, never flew there before, who cares?

21:52.800 --> 21:57.280
Oh, I don't know what to do with these toss-outs, I've scrambled wings.

22:00.960 --> 22:01.840
Okay, sorry.

22:01.840 --> 22:02.480
So.

22:02.480 --> 22:02.800
Sorry.

22:02.800 --> 22:11.440
All right. It actually went... Wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings.

22:11.440 --> 22:13.520
Wings, wings, wings, wings.

22:13.520 --> 22:17.400
Wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings.

22:17.400 --> 22:25.360
Aaaaaah glorious.

22:25.360 --> 22:29.320
So, this Yadru was sent in by,

22:29.320 --> 22:32.680
it was asked by Jackie, who asks,

22:32.680 --> 22:34.700
"'Puzzle of the muscles?'

22:35.600 --> 22:38.080
I have only been a massage therapist for five months

22:38.080 --> 22:39.280
and have been receiving guidance

22:39.280 --> 22:41.200
from the lead therapist at my work.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.080
She says that I should look over the muscles

22:43.080 --> 22:45.080
of the body again to see how they run.

22:45.080 --> 22:47.400
I joked saying that I should just make

22:47.400 --> 22:49.320
a puzzle of the muscles.

22:49.320 --> 22:50.880
Well, she really liked that idea

22:50.880 --> 22:53.000
and now wants to see me make one.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.920
How would I make a puzzle of the muscles?

22:56.920 --> 22:57.740
Thanks.

22:58.720 --> 23:01.360
You're gonna need to collect some muscles.

23:01.360 --> 23:02.200
It's gonna be the tricky part.

23:02.200 --> 23:03.160
That's gonna be number one.

23:03.160 --> 23:06.240
It's gonna be getting your hands on some legal muscles.

23:06.240 --> 23:07.920
Would you do a three-dimensional puzzle

23:07.920 --> 23:11.160
or is it gonna be two-dimensional, just like for babies?

23:11.160 --> 23:14.680
If you're using human muscle mass,

23:14.680 --> 23:16.440
it's gonna be in three dimensions.

23:16.440 --> 23:19.040
Here's the thing, you could do like a foam,

23:19.040 --> 23:24.040
like a human analog, you know, Mythbusters-style thing,

23:24.200 --> 23:27.800
but I feel like the consistency difference

23:27.800 --> 23:32.640
of not actual flesh muscles would,

23:32.640 --> 23:34.840
nobody's coming back to do it a second time.

23:34.840 --> 23:35.840
You know what I mean?

23:37.720 --> 23:40.080
Griff, your read on this is confusing to me.

23:40.080 --> 23:42.760
I don't think this massage therapist guru

23:42.760 --> 23:44.520
was instructing this person to create

23:44.520 --> 23:48.160
a Hannibal-esque sculpture made of human muscles

23:48.160 --> 23:50.280
that could be disassembled and reassembled.

23:50.280 --> 23:52.120
You're now who's misunderstanding.

23:52.120 --> 23:54.820
You're the misunderstand-er, sir,

23:54.820 --> 23:56.320
because it's not gonna be a statue.

23:56.320 --> 23:57.780
It's gotta be interactive.

23:57.780 --> 24:00.880
There's gotta be an interactive sort of gameplay element

24:00.880 --> 24:02.360
to it, because it's a puzzle,

24:02.360 --> 24:04.160
and they want you to solve it.

24:04.160 --> 24:05.620
It needs to be vaguely human,

24:05.620 --> 24:07.600
but you have to work this thing out for yourself.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.480
Maybe there's a word search in there somewhere.

24:09.480 --> 24:12.320
Ooh, a jumble, a jumble of muscles.

24:12.320 --> 24:15.640
A jumble of meat, but there's somewhere in there

24:15.640 --> 24:18.560
is the word that's gonna unlock the triptych.

24:18.560 --> 24:20.200
And Justin, there's a precedent for this.

24:20.200 --> 24:21.880
You went to it, I think.

24:21.880 --> 24:24.120
What was that museum exhibit with all the skin bodies?

24:24.120 --> 24:25.840
It was bodies, yeah.

24:25.840 --> 24:28.120
It's just like that, except interactive for kids.

24:28.120 --> 24:30.340
You were not encouraged to disassemble

24:30.340 --> 24:32.040
and reassemble those, that's ghoul.

24:32.040 --> 24:35.340
Well, not encouraged, but they also slip them a fiver,

24:35.340 --> 24:36.180
and you can do whatever you want.

24:36.180 --> 24:38.400
No, I mean, you were actively discouraged

24:38.400 --> 24:40.920
from disassembling and reassembling the muscles.

24:40.920 --> 24:44.560
There's a big person that stands by each exhibit

24:44.560 --> 24:47.120
to keep people from touching them,

24:47.120 --> 24:50.040
to keep people from reassembling them into,

24:50.040 --> 24:51.880
I don't know, a double man.

24:51.880 --> 24:54.720
And they didn't have any kind of take-home version, or?

24:54.720 --> 24:57.880
Most museums don't actually have a take-home version.

24:57.880 --> 24:59.280
They do, no, but they have,

24:59.280 --> 25:00.540
like you go in the gift shop and it's like,

25:00.540 --> 25:04.520
here's a tiny Mona Lisa, here's a little David.

25:05.560 --> 25:06.880
I mean, they sold Operation,

25:06.880 --> 25:08.000
but I don't think that's the same thing.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.480
Well, it's a Stark.

25:09.480 --> 25:10.320
Thanks.

25:11.240 --> 25:13.000
Let's do a different Yahoo, something with some more meat.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.440
But I made that good joke.

25:14.440 --> 25:17.700
This Yahoo is sent in by Ira Ray.

25:17.700 --> 25:19.780
Are you Ira Ray?

25:19.780 --> 25:21.480
Who wants to know?

25:21.480 --> 25:24.280
Thank you, Ira Ray, it's by Yahoo Answers user.

25:24.280 --> 25:27.880
Mysterious Griffin, but that's with YPH,

25:27.880 --> 25:29.720
so it's not my brand.

25:29.720 --> 25:33.540
Mysterious Griffin asks, homemade, in quotes,

25:33.540 --> 25:37.440
homemade ways to replicate the look of a butt bra?

25:37.440 --> 25:38.280
Wait, what?

25:38.280 --> 25:42.220
I'm not talking about exercise, but about ways to dress.

25:42.220 --> 25:44.000
I've seen butt bras online,

25:44.000 --> 25:45.480
but these are expensive.

25:45.480 --> 25:46.640
Are there any homemade ways

25:46.640 --> 25:49.320
to replicate the look of a butt bra?

25:49.320 --> 25:51.600
Update, I should have been more clear.

25:53.900 --> 25:56.000
I feel like you're pretty explicit.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.640
A butt bra lifts the buttocks.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.620
It does not use padding at all.

26:00.620 --> 26:03.840
I am not interested in padding, just lifting.

26:03.840 --> 26:07.360
I would think padding would be so much easier.

26:07.360 --> 26:08.200
Way easier.

26:08.200 --> 26:09.440
Like way wicked easy.

26:09.440 --> 26:12.040
Trying to like reshape,

26:12.040 --> 26:14.760
like someone making a man-made lake,

26:14.760 --> 26:17.500
trying to reshape the waters of your buttocks

26:17.500 --> 26:21.320
into some sort of fashionable, fashionable visage.

26:21.320 --> 26:24.640
May I be vulnerable for a moment?

26:24.640 --> 26:26.440
I feel like you've been extremely vulnerable

26:26.440 --> 26:27.760
this whole episode.

26:27.760 --> 26:28.940
Thank you, Griffin.

26:28.940 --> 26:30.520
I've seen, you're a raw wound.

26:31.440 --> 26:36.440
How is a butt bra with no padding

26:36.440 --> 26:40.320
that just lifts,

26:40.320 --> 26:45.320
how is it different from like tight underpants?

26:46.040 --> 26:48.560
Because it lifts and separates.

26:48.560 --> 26:53.560
But is it like suspenders attached to underpants?

26:54.640 --> 26:57.320
Like how are you getting the lifting action?

26:57.320 --> 27:00.200
I'm assuming it's like a hammock.

27:00.200 --> 27:02.740
I would imagine it's constructed like a hammock

27:02.740 --> 27:06.880
with like, and it swoops over your shoulders

27:06.880 --> 27:07.960
and around your neck,

27:07.960 --> 27:11.240
sort of like you're hauling,

27:11.240 --> 27:15.740
like a villager hauling water from the well.

27:15.740 --> 27:17.840
It's like that same sort of contraption,

27:17.840 --> 27:19.160
like a leather strap.

27:19.160 --> 27:21.000
A front to back saddlebag.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.360
Right, exactly, exactly.

27:23.360 --> 27:24.880
Well, how do you recreate that without this?

27:24.880 --> 27:25.720
How do you recreate that?

27:25.720 --> 27:27.680
Because they're very,

27:27.680 --> 27:30.800
they're imaginary and they're very expensive.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.640
Maybe a belt wrapped around your neck.

27:33.640 --> 27:34.960
Okay, so I just,

27:34.960 --> 27:36.960
one problem that I've noticed with your plan so far.

27:36.960 --> 27:38.120
Okay.

27:38.120 --> 27:39.680
Is that's not safe.

27:39.680 --> 27:40.500
It's not safe.

27:40.500 --> 27:42.560
Well, it depends on your butt size.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.720
If your butt's very heavy in a fashion

27:44.720 --> 27:46.940
that's gonna make it choking sort of hazard,

27:46.940 --> 27:47.840
you don't wanna do that.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.680
How about a bungee cord with fish hooks on either end?

27:50.680 --> 27:51.520
Oh my God.

27:51.520 --> 27:52.360
And you're gonna get-

27:52.360 --> 27:54.040
Jesus, saw five.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.400
No, I'm just saying like you get down the bottom.

27:56.400 --> 27:59.720
Okay, well maybe instead of fish hooks,

27:59.720 --> 28:01.560
just like a really strong duct tape.

28:01.560 --> 28:03.040
Is that better?

28:03.040 --> 28:05.440
A little bit, but it's still not good.

28:05.440 --> 28:07.320
Can you get little cross,

28:07.320 --> 28:10.520
like a cross beam that goes from your thigh

28:10.520 --> 28:12.840
that just sort of holds your butt up,

28:12.840 --> 28:13.840
but then no through the pants.

28:13.840 --> 28:15.360
It would look like you would have,

28:15.360 --> 28:17.000
like an acute triangle in there.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.840
You're gonna need a flying buttress.

28:18.840 --> 28:22.160
Like a nice curve, hold that butt up.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.000
And pun intended.

28:24.000 --> 28:24.920
Was it?

28:24.920 --> 28:25.800
Yep.

28:25.800 --> 28:26.640
What about a-

28:26.640 --> 28:28.040
I didn't emphasize it enough though.

28:28.040 --> 28:28.960
Can I try it again?

28:28.960 --> 28:30.800
A flying buttress.

28:30.800 --> 28:31.640
Ah!

28:31.640 --> 28:32.480
Oh no.

28:32.480 --> 28:37.480
Um, can you get a sort of page or servant boy

28:38.960 --> 28:40.960
to just sort of hold it up for you

28:40.960 --> 28:45.260
that you walk around sort of like he's carrying your train.

28:45.260 --> 28:46.100
I like that.

28:46.100 --> 28:46.940
Is that-

28:46.940 --> 28:48.560
You're gonna need two,

28:48.560 --> 28:50.700
because what you're gonna need is like a two by four.

28:50.700 --> 28:52.520
I don't think a small boy would be appropriate

28:52.520 --> 28:55.400
because you're getting into some legal issues there.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.240
Yeah.

28:56.240 --> 28:57.200
I think you gotta get an Ewok

28:57.200 --> 28:59.240
because they're exactly the right size.

28:59.240 --> 29:02.080
You just slap your dress over the Ewok in the back

29:02.080 --> 29:04.320
and have the Ewok go around like yub, yub,

29:04.320 --> 29:05.600
just carrying your butt around.

29:05.600 --> 29:07.840
Yep, Jubjub, you know the rules.

29:07.840 --> 29:08.920
I'm trying to twerk over here.

29:08.920 --> 29:10.160
So do the thing you do.

29:10.160 --> 29:12.640
Do the thing you do to make me twerk artificially, Jubjub.

29:12.640 --> 29:14.920
If you paid a, okay,

29:14.920 --> 29:17.880
if you paid an Ewok in walnuts and stuff

29:17.880 --> 29:21.720
to carry your butt around,

29:21.720 --> 29:24.240
is there any chance he makes it through the entire night

29:24.240 --> 29:26.000
without trying to stick his finger in your butt?

29:26.000 --> 29:27.280
Like guarantee he tries to-

29:27.280 --> 29:28.120
What the fuck?

29:28.120 --> 29:28.940
Wait.

29:28.940 --> 29:29.780
I'm just thinking about what I know of Ewoks.

29:29.780 --> 29:30.680
They're mischievous.

29:30.680 --> 29:31.520
Hold on.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.600
That's what you know of Ewoks?

29:33.600 --> 29:35.240
Like when they get a little bit frustrated

29:35.240 --> 29:36.320
because they're not getting enough

29:36.320 --> 29:37.160
like acorns and berries or whatever?

29:37.160 --> 29:38.000
They're from the forest,

29:38.000 --> 29:39.520
they're from the forest moon of Endor.

29:39.520 --> 29:41.080
They eat walnuts and berries

29:41.080 --> 29:44.080
and they love to finger blast you in the background.

29:44.080 --> 29:45.720
Here's the problem though.

29:45.720 --> 29:48.040
Do you give them all the acorns up front?

29:48.040 --> 29:49.080
Do you give them to be in the light?

29:49.080 --> 29:50.360
He blows his way through them.

29:50.360 --> 29:52.560
It depends on what you want.

29:52.560 --> 29:56.760
Because if you want an Ewok to turn you into a meaty puppet,

29:56.760 --> 29:59.480
if you want an Ewok to turn you into a puzzle of muscles,

29:59.480 --> 30:00.840
then you do give them all up front.

30:00.840 --> 30:02.200
And he's like, well, I got paid.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.360
So I can, now this is wicked.

30:04.360 --> 30:05.200
Now this is wicked opportunity.

30:05.200 --> 30:07.520
You gotta give them half up front and half at the end.

30:07.520 --> 30:08.680
Like you're higher to hit man.

30:08.680 --> 30:09.760
Yeah.

30:09.760 --> 30:10.600
Hey Griffin.

30:10.600 --> 30:11.420
Yeah.

30:11.420 --> 30:12.880
Show me those wings again.

30:12.880 --> 30:14.680
Show me those wings.

30:14.680 --> 30:18.760
Don't waste another minute on your flyin'.

30:18.760 --> 30:19.720
Minute on your flyin'.

30:19.720 --> 30:20.840
What was it?

30:20.840 --> 30:25.000
Don't waste another minute on your flyin'.

30:25.000 --> 30:25.840
Flyin'.

30:25.840 --> 30:26.660
Minute on your flyin'.

30:26.660 --> 30:28.240
Minute on your flyin'.

30:28.240 --> 30:29.160
Because it rhymes with cryin'.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.640
One more time.

30:30.640 --> 30:32.480
Don't waste another.

30:32.480 --> 30:36.080
Maybe I hear where the wings are callin'.

30:36.080 --> 30:37.000
Frazier.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.160
Lol all over my face.

30:41.080 --> 30:42.280
Wings.

30:42.280 --> 30:43.120
What was that?

30:43.120 --> 30:43.960
Seinfeld.

30:45.200 --> 30:47.600
I thought it was actually a little bit of Doug.

30:47.600 --> 30:48.440
Wings.

30:48.440 --> 30:51.640
Let's go to the money zone.

30:51.640 --> 30:53.000
And we've earned it.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.060
Yeah.

30:54.060 --> 30:58.540
ما Verp

30:58.540 --> 31:04.680
You've probably already pooped your pants with laughter

31:04.680 --> 31:07.480
at some of these great wings related bits in the show

31:07.480 --> 31:08.720
and you're gonna need some new underwear.

31:08.720 --> 31:12.080
Luckily we've got a hookup just for you.

31:12.080 --> 31:14.720
It's Butt Bras, new sponsorship.

31:14.720 --> 31:15.840
Nah, it's not.

31:15.840 --> 31:17.480
It's MeUndies.com.

31:17.480 --> 31:20.920
It costs less than one of the upper echelon butt bras.

31:20.920 --> 31:23.560
It's about the price of a regular butt bra

31:23.560 --> 31:24.880
that you get in a store.

31:24.880 --> 31:27.200
It is admittedly slightly more expensive

31:27.200 --> 31:28.960
than an entry-level butt bra.

31:28.960 --> 31:32.040
Yeah, it's like a department store butt bra price.

31:32.040 --> 31:34.520
Their tagline is department store butt bra price,

31:34.520 --> 31:37.400
but higher echelon butt bra quality.

31:37.400 --> 31:38.880
Meundies.com is committed to making

31:38.880 --> 31:40.800
the world's most comfortable underwear.

31:40.800 --> 31:43.420
And right now you can get 20% off your first order

31:43.420 --> 31:47.300
when you go to MeUndies, that's M-E-Undies.com,

31:47.300 --> 31:48.720
slash my brother.

31:48.720 --> 31:50.600
And listen, if you don't love them,

31:50.600 --> 31:52.000
your first pair is free.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.320
We all wear them and we all are huge fans

31:55.320 --> 31:58.680
and we've heard from like so many listeners who said,

31:58.680 --> 32:00.040
these are the most comfortable underwear

32:00.040 --> 32:02.280
I've ever worn, you guys, did not steer me wrong.

32:02.280 --> 32:05.260
So you should definitely go get some of those.

32:05.260 --> 32:08.460
So you're wearing great underwear from MeUndies.

32:08.460 --> 32:09.620
Now what's next?

32:09.620 --> 32:10.460
What are you gonna do?

32:10.460 --> 32:13.660
Go to the, I wanna tell you guys about Basecamp.

32:14.900 --> 32:19.900
Basecamp is a project management service software solution.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.960
That's what they call it, the triple S.

32:21.960 --> 32:25.200
And what it does is it helps you wrangle people

32:25.200 --> 32:26.880
that are maybe doing different roles,

32:26.880 --> 32:28.680
that have different responsibilities

32:28.680 --> 32:30.040
and have different objectives,

32:30.040 --> 32:32.400
and lets you get them all under one umbrella

32:32.400 --> 32:33.820
and lead them towards a common goal,

32:33.820 --> 32:36.440
finishing the project, getting it done.

32:36.440 --> 32:37.280
Get it done.

32:37.280 --> 32:41.520
And again, it runs on secure servers up in the cloud.

32:41.520 --> 32:43.480
So you don't have to mess with anything technical.

32:43.480 --> 32:45.400
They do all that for you.

32:45.400 --> 32:47.220
If you're having a hard time just sort of getting,

32:47.220 --> 32:48.900
hey, it's like wrangling ducks.

32:48.900 --> 32:50.480
It's like herding ducks in here.

32:50.480 --> 32:53.840
And it's like being pecked to death by ducks.

32:53.840 --> 32:55.760
I would recommend that you go with Basecamp.

32:55.760 --> 32:57.640
And if you're a listener to My Brother, My Brother and Me,

32:57.640 --> 33:01.200
which you are, then you can try Basecamp for free

33:01.200 --> 33:05.160
for two months at Basecamp.com slash My Brother.

33:05.160 --> 33:07.720
Got a message on the Jumbotron, if you wanna

33:07.720 --> 33:09.000
give a quick message to your business

33:09.000 --> 33:10.400
or something to a friend,

33:10.400 --> 33:12.960
you can go to Maximumfun.org slash Jumbotron.

33:12.960 --> 33:16.240
This is, well, let's say about the Drunk and Ugly.

33:16.240 --> 33:20.780
It's a podcast featuring over 400 episodes

33:20.780 --> 33:23.000
of great storylines, hilarious characters

33:23.000 --> 33:26.360
and more indie RPGs than you can shake a wizard's staff at.

33:26.360 --> 33:29.000
You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll critically succeed

33:29.000 --> 33:30.720
at being entertained.

33:30.720 --> 33:35.040
Come check out the Drunk and Ugly actual play podcast.

33:35.040 --> 33:36.920
Griffin, how can I find this great sounding show

33:36.920 --> 33:38.040
with so many episodes?

33:38.040 --> 33:40.520
All you gotta do is go to their website

33:40.520 --> 33:42.280
at drunkandugly.com or just search

33:42.280 --> 33:43.600
for Drunk and Ugly on iTunes.

33:43.600 --> 33:44.560
You'll find it there.

33:44.560 --> 33:47.440
400 episodes is a lot of episodes.

33:47.440 --> 33:49.440
God, I hope we don't make it to 400.

33:49.440 --> 33:51.220
I will consider a personal failure

33:51.220 --> 33:53.040
if we make 400 episodes of this show.

33:53.040 --> 33:54.920
We also have a message for Anna.

33:54.920 --> 33:55.760
Oh.

33:55.760 --> 33:56.600
Oh.

33:56.600 --> 33:59.240
Go ahead, Drew.

33:59.240 --> 34:00.080
No, go for it.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.980
You have mispronounced the name.

34:02.980 --> 34:06.880
I have, Anna, like the Frozen character.

34:06.880 --> 34:07.960
It's from Liz.

34:07.960 --> 34:10.320
I think the Frozen character's named Anna, isn't it?

34:10.320 --> 34:11.440
I don't know anymore.

34:11.440 --> 34:12.720
I'm all turned around.

34:12.720 --> 34:14.320
Happy birthday, gig keeper.

34:14.320 --> 34:17.280
Here's a poem for you recited by the McElroy brother

34:17.280 --> 34:19.680
that is currently the closest geographically

34:19.680 --> 34:21.560
or emotionally to Angela Lansbury.

34:21.560 --> 34:22.840
That's actually correct.

34:22.840 --> 34:23.840
Love you.

34:23.840 --> 34:26.920
Your present from me is as late as can be.

34:26.920 --> 34:29.440
So I hope you don't think I don't care.

34:29.440 --> 34:32.680
I know that it's late, but I think that you're great

34:32.680 --> 34:35.200
from your sis with the magical hair.

34:35.200 --> 34:36.040
That's lovely.

34:36.040 --> 34:36.860
That's lovely.

34:36.860 --> 34:37.700
For a second, Travis,

34:37.700 --> 34:40.320
I was wondering why you were reading that in that voice

34:40.320 --> 34:44.160
and not in the voice of Angela Lansbury.

34:44.160 --> 34:47.380
And then I realized I was thinking of Maya Angelou.

34:49.960 --> 34:51.880
A lot of people get those two confused.

34:51.880 --> 34:54.000
That's two different people.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.120
The most different. Very different people, yeah.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.480
Both powerful women.

34:58.480 --> 34:59.860
Sexy, strong.

34:59.860 --> 35:04.860
Hi, I'm Julie Sabatier, host of Rendered.

35:05.100 --> 35:08.420
It's a show about making meaning and breaking rules.

35:08.420 --> 35:11.020
We're answering important questions like,

35:11.020 --> 35:13.220
can you build a space suit in your living room?

35:13.220 --> 35:14.980
I went to my brother's place in Beaverton

35:14.980 --> 35:17.380
and he has a swimming pool and I pressurized the suit

35:17.380 --> 35:19.340
and sat down there underwater for about 10 minutes.

35:19.340 --> 35:21.260
The thing that I had built was supporting my life.

35:21.260 --> 35:22.780
That felt really good.

35:22.780 --> 35:25.500
What does it sound like when you play a polka record

35:25.500 --> 35:30.500
through a styrofoam cup?

35:31.780 --> 35:34.100
And what happens when an airport carpet

35:34.100 --> 35:35.940
gains a cult following?

35:35.940 --> 35:39.300
Oh my goodness, the carpet has an Instagram.

35:39.300 --> 35:42.220
Check out Rendered now at MaximumFun.org

35:42.220 --> 35:44.480
or wherever you like to listen to podcasts.

35:46.580 --> 35:48.660
My fiancee and I are in the process

35:48.660 --> 35:50.340
of planning our wedding.

35:50.340 --> 35:52.260
We're pretty in sync with most of the decisions so far,

35:52.260 --> 35:53.620
including trying to get a famous person

35:53.620 --> 35:54.820
to attend the wedding.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.340
However, we have different strategies.

35:56.340 --> 35:57.740
I say we should cast a wide net

35:57.740 --> 35:59.380
by inviting multiple big celebrities

35:59.380 --> 36:01.740
and hope that one is free that day.

36:01.740 --> 36:04.100
He thinks we should only invite one lesser known

36:04.100 --> 36:05.860
but still recognizable celebrity

36:05.860 --> 36:09.140
as they'll be flattered and definitely show it.

36:09.140 --> 36:11.780
Who has the fail-proof plan?

36:11.780 --> 36:14.460
That's from RSV Please Help.

36:14.460 --> 36:17.900
Dear Kevin Sorbo, I'm inviting you to our wedding

36:17.900 --> 36:20.660
and it's important that you know

36:20.660 --> 36:23.660
that you are the only famous person we've invited.

36:23.660 --> 36:26.660
We are putting all of our eggs in the sore basket.

36:26.660 --> 36:28.380
Are you worried that you'll get a response

36:28.380 --> 36:29.540
from Kevin Sorbo who's like,

36:29.540 --> 36:31.140
I was just talking to French Stewart

36:31.140 --> 36:33.100
and he said you invited him too.

36:33.100 --> 36:34.900
What the fuck, Steve?

36:34.900 --> 36:35.860
Or they both show up

36:35.860 --> 36:38.820
and you don't have enough chicken to go around.

36:38.820 --> 36:40.700
I only plan on one of you showing up.

36:40.700 --> 36:42.860
Bro, if Sorbo shows up,

36:42.860 --> 36:45.180
there's not gonna be enough chicken to go around.

36:45.180 --> 36:47.060
That fool will eat all the chicken in the place.

36:47.060 --> 36:49.380
He eats up all the chicken that you got on your shelf.

36:49.380 --> 36:51.580
So just let him introduce himself.

36:51.580 --> 36:54.620
He's Kevin, the chicken boy Sorbo.

36:54.620 --> 36:56.300
He loves chicken.

36:56.300 --> 36:58.780
He won't even be done with your vows.

36:58.780 --> 37:01.260
You'll hear a clatter and a clang in the kitchen.

37:01.260 --> 37:02.100
What is that?

37:02.100 --> 37:02.940
It's Kevin Sorbo eating.

37:02.940 --> 37:05.060
What do you mean this is all the chicken you have?

37:05.060 --> 37:08.500
Chicken boy, we haven't even cooked that shit yet.

37:08.500 --> 37:09.980
Sorbo.

37:09.980 --> 37:12.500
I just imagine those thoughts from Kevin Sorbo

37:12.500 --> 37:15.020
is like, here's my standard contract.

37:15.020 --> 37:18.100
I'll show up two seconds before the vows,

37:18.100 --> 37:19.900
I'll listen to one of you do the vows,

37:19.900 --> 37:21.460
then I'm on that chicken.

37:21.460 --> 37:23.860
I need at least 30 pounds.

37:23.860 --> 37:25.900
The worst part is he eats the bones

37:25.900 --> 37:27.700
and then calls them Sorbo's.

37:27.700 --> 37:28.780
That makes it okay.

37:28.780 --> 37:31.300
And that's crazy is that he somehow,

37:31.300 --> 37:32.700
and nobody's been able to figure this out,

37:32.700 --> 37:35.900
science, religion, nobody's been able to figure this out yet.

37:35.900 --> 37:40.020
He eats the bones and he adds them to his skeleton.

37:40.020 --> 37:42.620
And don't offer that fool any Sorbet.

37:42.620 --> 37:44.420
He will fucking lose his mind.

37:44.420 --> 37:45.700
Yeah, I get it.

37:45.700 --> 37:48.180
He looks like Doomsday at this point.

37:48.180 --> 37:51.340
Chicken bones emitting from his skin,

37:51.340 --> 37:53.300
like some sort of a chitin.

37:55.620 --> 37:58.020
Why is Kevin, here's what I don't get.

37:58.020 --> 37:59.620
Where is he putting it all?

37:59.620 --> 38:02.460
Because I've seen Kevin Sorbo eat five whole chicken bones.

38:02.460 --> 38:04.660
He goes home and he feeds it to his chicks.

38:04.660 --> 38:05.980
Wait, that's weird.

38:05.980 --> 38:07.460
To the baby Sorbo's.

38:07.460 --> 38:11.340
Okay, he creates a pellet in his gullet, right?

38:11.340 --> 38:14.260
It gets mushed up with the rocks that he's eaten earlier.

38:14.260 --> 38:17.020
And then he goes home to the baby Sorbo's.

38:17.020 --> 38:18.980
And mama birds it in.

38:18.980 --> 38:21.420
And mama birds it into his baby Sorbo's.

38:21.420 --> 38:23.660
If you cut one of those,

38:23.660 --> 38:27.020
if you cut one of those eboluses,

38:27.020 --> 38:28.500
like eolus from Hercules,

38:29.820 --> 38:30.820
cut one of those open,

38:30.820 --> 38:33.260
you can tell how old Kevin Sorbo is.

38:33.260 --> 38:35.740
The answer is 615 years old.

38:35.740 --> 38:36.660
It's the bones.

38:36.660 --> 38:37.500
He looks so young.

38:37.500 --> 38:38.980
It's the bones.

38:41.500 --> 38:43.820
I heard when the bird flu was going around in China,

38:43.820 --> 38:45.500
he didn't leave his house for three weeks.

38:45.500 --> 38:46.500
He was terrified.

38:46.500 --> 38:47.540
Yeah.

38:47.540 --> 38:48.860
He started stockpiling.

38:51.100 --> 38:53.620
Why would you want a famous person?

38:53.620 --> 38:56.740
That would be the most uncomfortable thing ever, right?

38:56.740 --> 38:58.500
To have just a stranger at you.

38:58.500 --> 39:00.380
You would be constantly worrying about,

39:00.380 --> 39:03.460
is Kevin Sorbo having a good time?

39:03.460 --> 39:06.300
And you're gonna neglect every other person at that wedding

39:06.300 --> 39:07.500
if Sorbo's there.

39:07.500 --> 39:08.900
You do not need the distraction.

39:08.900 --> 39:09.740
Trust me on this.

39:09.740 --> 39:11.540
There is a better way to go about this,

39:11.540 --> 39:13.940
and that is contact all of your guests and say,

39:13.940 --> 39:16.660
now, we're so glad that you guys are able to make it great.

39:16.660 --> 39:19.900
Do you have any personal connections

39:19.900 --> 39:22.740
to a famous person you could bring with you?

39:22.740 --> 39:23.580
Oh, okay.

39:23.580 --> 39:24.740
If it's Kevin Sorbo.

39:24.740 --> 39:28.740
So that way, like somebody else is responsible for it,

39:28.740 --> 39:29.900
but they're there.

39:29.900 --> 39:33.860
Here, to answer the question concretely,

39:33.860 --> 39:37.540
which we so rarely are able to do,

39:37.540 --> 39:39.940
the one of you that is right

39:39.940 --> 39:43.100
is the one who says that you should cast a wide net,

39:43.100 --> 39:48.100
because we are some of the least famous people

39:48.540 --> 39:51.060
that you will meet,

39:51.060 --> 39:52.900
and we have gotten wedding invitations

39:52.900 --> 39:56.980
that we have not executed on.

39:56.980 --> 40:00.100
So I think that casting a wide net is probably good,

40:00.100 --> 40:02.580
just like hope Cheech Marin is in the neighborhood.

40:02.580 --> 40:04.220
Less famous than us.

40:04.220 --> 40:06.180
Less famous than us is what I'm saying.

40:06.180 --> 40:11.180
And that's not a big circle of people.

40:11.180 --> 40:12.580
No, there's not a lot of people.

40:12.580 --> 40:15.380
It's just us, Cheech Marin, and Kevin Sorbo.

40:16.540 --> 40:18.100
I had a Yahoo. The new Beatles.

40:18.100 --> 40:23.100
Justin can attest to this.

40:24.700 --> 40:25.980
I was sitting here,

40:25.980 --> 40:27.780
and I accidentally clicked the refresh button

40:27.780 --> 40:28.620
on one of my Yahoos.

40:28.620 --> 40:29.460
And that's a shame,

40:29.460 --> 40:31.200
because I lost the name of the person that sent it in.

40:31.200 --> 40:33.860
Not only that, it's been deleted

40:33.860 --> 40:35.060
while we were sitting here.

40:35.060 --> 40:35.880
It's been moderated.

40:35.880 --> 40:37.980
Do you remember the subject? It was John from Durham

40:37.980 --> 40:40.640
was the person who sent it in.

40:40.640 --> 40:42.180
I saw that much.

40:42.180 --> 40:43.880
But I didn't see the actual,

40:45.660 --> 40:48.360
didn't actually see the question.

40:48.360 --> 40:49.500
Shit, birds.

40:49.500 --> 40:50.700
Can't believe this.

40:50.700 --> 40:51.820
I can't, but do you remember the subject?

40:51.820 --> 40:53.060
Oh, oh, oh.

40:53.060 --> 40:58.060
Oh, Griffin is using Google's spider crawlers

41:00.620 --> 41:02.180
to view a cached version.

41:02.180 --> 41:04.380
Wow, you're going deep for this one.

41:04.380 --> 41:06.080
I did it, I recovered the data.

41:06.080 --> 41:07.580
You're out in Silk Road picking this up.

41:07.580 --> 41:09.840
John Durham, a bunch of people actually sent this in.

41:09.840 --> 41:11.860
But the first, as far as I can tell, is John Durham.

41:11.860 --> 41:13.660
There has been, I-

41:13.660 --> 41:15.060
Sorry about using your whole name, by the way,

41:15.060 --> 41:15.900
John Durham.

41:15.900 --> 41:16.740
Yeah, it's okay.

41:16.740 --> 41:18.100
He knows what he was getting into.

41:18.100 --> 41:19.620
I neglect people sometimes,

41:19.620 --> 41:21.560
because I get a lot of multiple submissions

41:21.560 --> 41:22.400
of the same question,

41:22.400 --> 41:24.020
and I just pick one at random.

41:24.020 --> 41:27.220
And last week I did that to poor Rachel Sperling twice,

41:27.220 --> 41:28.980
and I felt so bad about it.

41:28.980 --> 41:30.740
And it was just luck of the draw.

41:30.740 --> 41:31.680
It's just luck of the draw.

41:31.680 --> 41:34.060
Now I'm trying to come up with a more equitable solution,

41:34.060 --> 41:37.340
which is first in gets the name treatment.

41:37.340 --> 41:38.180
Got it.

41:38.180 --> 41:40.280
So John Durham or Dunham, fuck.

41:40.280 --> 41:41.120
Jeff Dunham.

41:41.120 --> 41:42.100
Jeff Dunham sent this one in.

41:42.100 --> 41:44.060
Thanks, I love all your racist puppets.

41:46.260 --> 41:47.180
It's by Yahoo Answers.

41:47.180 --> 41:48.120
Well, I'm not gonna know who did it,

41:48.120 --> 41:49.120
because the question's been deleted.

41:49.120 --> 41:50.860
So you should just be happy that I'm gonna be able

41:50.860 --> 41:52.120
to read the question to you at all.

41:52.120 --> 41:53.420
You selfish prick.

41:54.480 --> 41:55.320
Got him.

41:55.320 --> 42:00.320
My boyfriend, to be, keeps on giving me the head lice.

42:00.640 --> 42:03.220
About two months ago, I found some head lice in my hair.

42:03.220 --> 42:05.780
The morning after someone I'm dating slept at my place.

42:05.780 --> 42:07.280
I did the treatment the same day.

42:07.280 --> 42:09.220
Two weeks later, slept together again.

42:09.220 --> 42:11.660
And I found living lice again.

42:11.660 --> 42:12.820
It happened again yesterday.

42:12.820 --> 42:14.220
Then I got the treatment again.

42:14.220 --> 42:17.900
And today it was, well, that's four lices.

42:17.900 --> 42:19.820
That's four different lice events.

42:19.820 --> 42:21.160
What should I do?

42:21.160 --> 42:23.740
We're not close enough to talk about that.

42:23.740 --> 42:26.300
But I'm pretty sure he's the one giving them to me,

42:26.300 --> 42:27.540
tired of doing treatments

42:27.540 --> 42:29.900
and changing tons of sheets after we're sleeping.

42:29.900 --> 42:32.180
I thought about telling him I got them somehow.

42:32.180 --> 42:35.180
And in a responsible way, I'm telling him,

42:35.180 --> 42:37.180
but I'm afraid he'll be turned off by me.

42:37.180 --> 42:38.780
Please help me, frowny face.

42:38.780 --> 42:39.620
This is-

42:39.620 --> 42:40.460
Turn off by you?

42:40.460 --> 42:41.620
He's the lice guy.

42:41.620 --> 42:43.080
This is a tale as old as time.

42:43.080 --> 42:45.120
We get this question every week,

42:45.120 --> 42:47.280
where people say, I'm sleeping with someone,

42:47.280 --> 42:51.660
but at what point is it time to say, I know you have lice?

42:51.660 --> 42:52.620
You know what I mean?

42:52.620 --> 42:55.140
Like, yes, we will engage in intercourse

42:55.140 --> 42:56.900
and sleep in the same bed together,

42:56.900 --> 42:58.460
but we're not quite at the place

42:58.460 --> 43:02.060
where we're comfortable talking about each other's head lice.

43:02.060 --> 43:04.980
And he's probably very embarrassed about it.

43:04.980 --> 43:06.340
Here's what drives me crazy,

43:06.340 --> 43:07.740
is you've done four of these treatments.

43:07.740 --> 43:11.180
If he does one, he's probably good to go at that.

43:11.180 --> 43:12.980
I don't think he is that embarrassed, Griffin.

43:12.980 --> 43:14.980
I'm saying maybe that's what he thinks

43:14.980 --> 43:16.380
he's bringing to the table.

43:16.380 --> 43:18.500
Listen, I don't have a great personality.

43:18.500 --> 43:20.740
I'm not very rich, but you know what I do have?

43:20.740 --> 43:21.900
Head full of lice.

43:21.900 --> 43:23.900
A billion little fingers to please you.

43:23.900 --> 43:25.340
Oh, God.

43:25.340 --> 43:26.780
We're gonna share this together, baby.

43:26.780 --> 43:28.380
Go, go, my little- You and me and the lice.

43:28.380 --> 43:30.100
My little sexual servant.

43:30.100 --> 43:31.020
Hey, baby.

43:31.020 --> 43:32.740
Oh, I'm going to- My nanobot.

43:32.740 --> 43:34.420
I'm gonna sit down my nanobots

43:34.420 --> 43:36.060
to please your every crevice.

43:36.060 --> 43:37.700
Hey, baby, have you seen Ant-Man?

43:37.700 --> 43:40.420
There's something way worse than that.

43:40.420 --> 43:42.060
Call me Lice Bryce.

43:42.060 --> 43:45.980
Lice Bryce, Ant-Man's shitty brother.

43:45.980 --> 43:47.460
Oh, Lice Bryce.

43:47.460 --> 43:49.900
I only use my powers for sexual pleasure.

43:49.900 --> 43:51.100
Oh, God.

43:51.100 --> 43:54.900
Maybe you're giving it to each other on alternating days.

43:54.900 --> 43:57.140
One of you does the treatment, gives the other one lice,

43:57.140 --> 43:58.580
that one doesn't does the treatment,

43:58.580 --> 44:00.260
then you give him back the same lice.

44:00.260 --> 44:03.140
The lice are just bouncing back and forth between your heads.

44:03.140 --> 44:04.940
Is it weird that what I'm taking away from this question

44:04.940 --> 44:06.540
is how many times you have to sleep together

44:06.540 --> 44:09.860
before you transition from boyfriend-to-be to boyfriends?

44:10.740 --> 44:12.620
Yeah, I think you sound a little judgmental

44:12.620 --> 44:13.460
talking about that.

44:13.460 --> 44:18.140
I've also never described anyone as my girlfriend-to-be.

44:18.140 --> 44:20.780
Well, Trav, I think if somebody gave me lice four times,

44:20.780 --> 44:22.700
I'd probably keep him in the maybe column.

44:22.700 --> 44:24.540
I don't know.

44:24.540 --> 44:26.220
Keep him on the bench for a little while.

44:26.220 --> 44:27.060
I don't know, Mom.

44:27.060 --> 44:27.900
He's great.

44:27.900 --> 44:29.380
I really have a great time with him.

44:29.380 --> 44:31.620
But there is the lice thing.

44:31.620 --> 44:34.380
Bryce can take me to pound town like no other.

44:34.380 --> 44:35.500
There's just one issue.

44:35.500 --> 44:36.460
Mom.

44:36.460 --> 44:38.940
Mom, is he's got little nanobots.

44:40.940 --> 44:42.860
The pound town is out of control.

44:42.860 --> 44:45.500
The nanobots, I could take or leave.

44:45.500 --> 44:47.940
So, honey, are we ready to take this thing

44:47.940 --> 44:49.020
to the next level or what?

44:49.020 --> 44:49.860
That depends.

44:49.860 --> 44:51.420
Did you buy a box of RID?

44:51.420 --> 44:52.860
Because if so, then yes.

44:52.860 --> 44:55.980
But until you treat your sexual army,

44:55.980 --> 44:58.540
I think we're gonna have to keep this in limbo.

44:58.540 --> 44:59.460
My boys?

44:59.460 --> 45:01.780
I'll never, stop trying to change me, woman.

45:03.180 --> 45:04.300
That is true.

45:04.300 --> 45:05.980
You know, that's a bad sign.

45:05.980 --> 45:08.100
If someone can accept you just the way you are,

45:08.100 --> 45:08.940
head lice and all.

45:08.940 --> 45:11.820
It says lice, Bryce, on my personalized license plate

45:11.820 --> 45:14.420
and lice, Bryce, I shall remain.

45:14.420 --> 45:15.740
My license plate.

45:15.740 --> 45:18.780
He didn't call it that because the word is in there.

45:18.780 --> 45:19.780
No, that was too bad.

45:19.780 --> 45:21.140
That was too much.

45:21.140 --> 45:25.140
Standing tall on the wings of my dreams.

45:25.140 --> 45:25.980
That one already had it in it.

45:25.980 --> 45:26.820
That one just works.

45:26.820 --> 45:27.660
It was already in there.

45:27.660 --> 45:28.500
As is.

45:28.500 --> 45:29.780
How's this episode been?

45:31.100 --> 45:33.180
We left a comment card on your table.

45:33.180 --> 45:35.260
If you could fill that out for us, that would be great.

45:35.260 --> 45:38.140
If you see a comment card appearing on your Zune right now

45:38.140 --> 45:41.620
or your iPod, just fill that out for us

45:41.620 --> 45:43.540
and mail it back if you don't mind.

45:43.540 --> 45:44.380
I thought it was pretty good.

45:44.380 --> 45:45.820
We probably have some listeners with lice

45:45.820 --> 45:47.340
that didn't appreciate some of those jokes.

45:47.340 --> 45:49.340
Do you know that I have been sitting here for 20 minutes

45:49.340 --> 45:50.540
trying to remember the fucking theme song

45:50.540 --> 45:51.500
of Who's the Boss?

45:51.500 --> 45:52.900
And I'll even keep coming up with this.

45:52.900 --> 45:53.860
Who's the boss?

45:53.860 --> 45:54.700
Who's the boss?

45:54.700 --> 45:56.140
Baby, who's the boss?

45:56.140 --> 45:58.060
Who's the boss, baby?

45:58.060 --> 46:00.420
And then I would have to do a parody of like what?

46:00.420 --> 46:03.460
You can count on wings.

46:03.460 --> 46:05.500
No matter where you fly.

46:05.500 --> 46:07.100
Oh shit, your baby's sleeping.

46:07.100 --> 46:08.140
Not anymore.

46:08.140 --> 46:10.060
Another baby nap ruined by wings.

46:10.060 --> 46:11.620
What's your earliest memory?

46:11.620 --> 46:14.460
I remember my uncle Griffin singing a parody.

46:15.460 --> 46:18.780
Well, and by parody, I mean he was singing the song

46:18.780 --> 46:22.780
in My Two Dads, but he just worked the word wings in there

46:22.780 --> 46:23.980
because it's a name of another.

46:23.980 --> 46:24.820
Why would he do that?

46:24.820 --> 46:26.220
I don't know.

46:26.220 --> 46:27.620
They have this shitty podcast.

46:27.620 --> 46:29.100
I think it was their last episode.

46:29.100 --> 46:30.460
Do you remember podcasts?

46:30.460 --> 46:31.300
No, I don't.

46:31.300 --> 46:32.420
I don't, I don't.

46:32.420 --> 46:33.700
Patent Trolls shut them all down.

46:33.700 --> 46:35.460
Hand me another electric burger.

46:35.460 --> 46:36.700
I do remember when my-

46:36.700 --> 46:41.700
Because this is the future.

46:41.700 --> 46:44.780
Okay, but in the future, oh wait, how long are we?

46:44.780 --> 46:47.580
Okay, electric burgers, I shall grant you,

46:47.580 --> 46:50.460
but the psychiatrist just has electric burgers right there.

46:50.460 --> 46:52.420
I didn't realize we were at a psychiatrist.

46:52.420 --> 46:54.620
I thought it was just two people stealing the shit

46:54.620 --> 46:56.420
down at the electric burger shack.

46:56.420 --> 46:58.300
I didn't bring you into the psychiatrist portion

46:58.300 --> 46:59.860
of the bit, sorry.

46:59.860 --> 47:01.860
I thought I had explained that.

47:01.860 --> 47:03.380
I was just in my mind's eye.

47:03.380 --> 47:05.180
Wouldn't you call them Cyburgers?

47:05.180 --> 47:06.820
Oh man, that's the point.

47:06.820 --> 47:08.740
No, Cyburgers is the place across the street

47:08.740 --> 47:11.140
that's putting electric burgers out of business.

47:11.140 --> 47:12.780
They just have a much better name.

47:12.780 --> 47:16.300
Yeah, you know, big business is shutting down

47:16.300 --> 47:19.140
mom and pop electric burgers stands all over the country.

47:19.140 --> 47:21.940
This is the plot of Good Burger 2024,

47:21.940 --> 47:26.780
which is the sci-fi post-apocalyptic remake.

47:26.780 --> 47:27.780
Any other ones?

47:27.780 --> 47:29.540
I feel like we haven't done Family Matters,

47:29.540 --> 47:32.020
step by step, wings by wings.

47:32.020 --> 47:34.460
So there's another one, just throw it up on the bonfire.

47:34.460 --> 47:38.540
They're brothers, identical brothers, but they're not.

47:38.540 --> 47:39.700
They walk alike, they talk alike,

47:39.700 --> 47:43.380
snarls even if I like, what a crazy wings.

47:43.380 --> 47:46.260
Well, they happen to predict the bill of wings.

47:46.260 --> 47:49.380
The wings man, the winger boy, even winged wings.

47:49.380 --> 47:54.380
And in my opinionation of wings, wings, wings,

47:54.660 --> 47:57.300
wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings.

47:57.300 --> 47:58.140
Blossom.

47:58.140 --> 48:00.780
Do you guys like my?

48:02.620 --> 48:05.220
Da, da, da, da, da, da, wings.

48:05.220 --> 48:06.060
Let's coach.

48:07.700 --> 48:09.100
I don't think we should do instrumentals anymore.

48:09.100 --> 48:10.140
I think it's harder.

48:10.140 --> 48:10.980
Yeah, you're right.

48:10.980 --> 48:12.100
I don't think it reads as well.

48:12.100 --> 48:16.780
I just went for coach and I actually booted up.

48:16.780 --> 48:20.180
I booted up the joke coach parody with wings in it.

48:20.180 --> 48:22.180
And then it didn't load in.

48:22.180 --> 48:25.700
The music didn't load in until I already opened my mouth.

48:25.700 --> 48:27.260
I keep that in my RAM apparently.

48:27.260 --> 48:30.620
I keep the coach theme just ready to access.

48:30.620 --> 48:32.980
I wish that was a scene in Inside Out.

48:32.980 --> 48:34.660
Always thinking about the coach theme again.

48:34.660 --> 48:35.500
Grab the bobble.

48:35.500 --> 48:36.340
Grab it.

48:36.340 --> 48:37.260
Oh shit, we dropped it.

48:37.260 --> 48:38.100
That's fine.

48:38.100 --> 48:41.060
No one's ever, no one has any reason to need that.

48:41.060 --> 48:43.660
Should we stop doing the show?

48:43.660 --> 48:44.700
Did we start?

48:46.580 --> 48:47.500
Take us to the bridge.

48:47.500 --> 48:49.100
You're just fucking looking at me.

48:49.100 --> 48:50.580
Are you turnt on your milk juice?

48:50.580 --> 48:52.460
No, I'm trying to think of other sitcom themes.

48:52.460 --> 48:54.580
Okay, we're gonna wrap it up.

48:54.580 --> 48:55.740
But first, before we do that,

48:55.740 --> 48:57.380
I wanna say thanks again to MeUndies

48:57.380 --> 48:59.620
who are dedicated to offering the most comfortable underwear

48:59.620 --> 49:00.820
and that it's not a lie.

49:00.820 --> 49:02.700
That's not Hollywood bullshit.

49:02.700 --> 49:03.540
That's real.

49:03.540 --> 49:05.500
If you go to meundies.com slash my brother,

49:05.500 --> 49:06.900
you get 20% off your first order.

49:06.900 --> 49:08.580
You should already be wearing MeUndies now.

49:08.580 --> 49:09.420
Go.

49:10.420 --> 49:14.060
So no one told you planes were gonna fly this way.

49:14.060 --> 49:15.460
We did some twinks.

49:15.460 --> 49:16.660
You did five.

49:16.660 --> 49:18.580
We've got upcoming live shows.

49:18.580 --> 49:19.700
Oh, yeah, I forget.

49:19.700 --> 49:22.180
Yeah, Seattle and Vancouver.

49:22.180 --> 49:23.740
You still have a chance to come see us

49:23.740 --> 49:25.700
at the end of August last weekend.

49:25.700 --> 49:29.540
If you go to bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM van

49:29.540 --> 49:32.300
or bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM, no, sorry.

49:32.300 --> 49:35.500
Bit.ly forward slash van MBMBAM

49:35.500 --> 49:38.780
or bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM Seattle.

49:38.780 --> 49:39.620
And it's not just us.

49:39.620 --> 49:40.460
You can go buy tickets.

49:40.460 --> 49:41.300
Sawbones will be there as well.

49:41.300 --> 49:43.500
It's gonna be a full night of comedy.

49:43.500 --> 49:44.740
And if you play your cards right,

49:44.740 --> 49:46.460
you might even be able to see baby Charlie.

49:46.460 --> 49:47.300
And she's the cutest baby.

49:47.300 --> 49:49.420
Siddy's sister Riley is gonna turn 15

49:49.420 --> 49:50.620
when we're in Vancouver.

49:50.620 --> 49:52.500
It's gonna get crazy in Canada.

49:52.500 --> 49:53.500
She can legally drink.

49:53.500 --> 49:54.340
Legally drink.

49:54.340 --> 49:56.700
She can legally smoke weed.

49:56.700 --> 49:58.820
We've got another live show coming up in September.

49:58.820 --> 50:01.740
We can't give you all the details just yet.

50:01.740 --> 50:02.580
What?

50:02.580 --> 50:03.660
The DLs?

50:03.660 --> 50:04.500
The details.

50:04.500 --> 50:05.340
I'm sorry.

50:05.340 --> 50:06.860
We can't give you all the duck tales just yet,

50:06.860 --> 50:08.100
but it's gonna be awesome.

50:08.100 --> 50:09.500
And if you play your cards right,

50:09.500 --> 50:13.700
no matter where in the country or the world even you are,

50:13.700 --> 50:14.820
you may be able to watch it.

50:14.820 --> 50:15.700
So we're working on that.

50:15.700 --> 50:18.300
We'll let you know once we have everything squared away.

50:18.300 --> 50:22.340
We're gonna have a simultaneous IMAX satellite presentation.

50:22.340 --> 50:23.660
Oh, that makes way more sense.

50:23.660 --> 50:27.140
I thought we'd just have people acting it out in every city.

50:27.140 --> 50:28.740
Wait, what did they say?

50:28.740 --> 50:29.660
Okay, so hold on.

50:29.660 --> 50:30.980
Guys, stick with me here.

50:30.980 --> 50:32.860
And in my opinionation,

50:33.940 --> 50:35.660
wings and a-

50:35.660 --> 50:36.500
I lost it.

50:36.500 --> 50:38.020
Do you guys, that's nothing.

50:38.020 --> 50:39.340
The bit rate isn't high enough.

50:39.340 --> 50:40.740
This doesn't make any sense.

50:41.660 --> 50:43.500
Also, we put out our Totino's episode,

50:43.500 --> 50:45.780
and I hope to God you've already listened to it

50:45.780 --> 50:48.260
before the censors make us take it down

50:48.260 --> 50:49.540
for being too zesty.

50:51.820 --> 50:52.700
Yeah, that was our high,

50:52.700 --> 50:54.980
did you guys know that was our highest episode download,

50:54.980 --> 50:57.060
single episode download day ever?

50:57.060 --> 50:58.420
We got the Totino's bump.

50:58.420 --> 50:59.860
We got that Totino's bump.

50:59.860 --> 51:00.700
Thank you, Totino's.

51:00.700 --> 51:02.580
Thank you to John Roderick and The Long Winters

51:02.580 --> 51:04.060
who used our theme song, It's a Departure,

51:04.060 --> 51:04.980
off the album, Put in the Days,

51:04.980 --> 51:06.020
you bet it's a terrific album

51:06.020 --> 51:07.260
that you should go listen to.

51:07.260 --> 51:08.100
And if you live in Seattle,

51:08.100 --> 51:10.140
you should look up his platform.

51:10.140 --> 51:11.580
He's run for city council.

51:11.580 --> 51:13.020
I think like eighth district.

51:13.020 --> 51:14.940
Go check out his platform

51:14.940 --> 51:17.460
and then maybe think about voting for him in this election.

51:17.460 --> 51:18.420
You should also go check out

51:18.420 --> 51:20.460
all the other amazing Max Fund shows.

51:20.460 --> 51:21.660
They're all incredible.

51:21.660 --> 51:24.140
That's gonna do it for us.

51:24.140 --> 51:26.220
Griffin, do you have a final Yahoo for us

51:26.220 --> 51:27.340
to take us home,

51:27.340 --> 51:30.020
something to talk about over the week

51:30.020 --> 51:31.820
and then we'll answer it next week?

51:31.820 --> 51:33.380
Yes, take this in your craw.

51:33.380 --> 51:35.300
It's from YadruDruDruDavenport.

51:35.300 --> 51:36.140
Thank you, Drew.

51:36.140 --> 51:37.820
It's by YadruAnswersUser.

51:43.380 --> 51:47.580
present ideas for someone who likes pizza, butts,

51:47.580 --> 51:48.420
and goats.

51:48.420 --> 51:52.420
I'm Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy.

51:52.420 --> 51:53.700
I'm Griffin McElroy.

51:53.700 --> 51:55.020
This has been my brother, my brother.

51:55.020 --> 51:57.020
May kiss your dads.

51:57.020 --> 51:57.980
Gware on the lips.

51:57.980 --> 51:59.220
You forget?

51:59.220 --> 52:00.060
Duck wings.

52:00.060 --> 52:01.500
Woo. There it is.

52:01.500 --> 52:20.500

Hello, I'm Taco, the elephant magician.

52:32.700 --> 52:34.420
Did you guys like that?

52:34.420 --> 52:36.500
Did you, the listener, like that?

52:36.500 --> 52:38.340
You were just swept up in a world

52:38.340 --> 52:39.580
of high fantasy and magic

52:39.580 --> 52:42.060
where anything can happen and anything is possible.

52:42.060 --> 52:43.260
Hi, I'm Griffin McElroy,

52:43.260 --> 52:44.860
Dungeon Master for The Adventure Zone,

52:44.860 --> 52:46.700
a new podcast on Maximum Fun

52:46.700 --> 52:48.700
in which magic and mystery intertwine

52:48.700 --> 52:52.460
for a very erotically charged role-playing experience.

52:52.460 --> 52:53.900
You can catch it every other Thursday

52:53.900 --> 52:55.900
here on MaximumFun.org or iTunes.

52:55.900 --> 53:00.900
It's for Dungeons and Dragons, but with family.
