00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.720
Hey everybody, this is me, Griffin McElroy, your youngest brother.

00:48.720 --> 00:51.200
This is me, Travis McElroy, your middle-est brother.

00:51.200 --> 00:57.520
And this is my brother, my brother and me, where we take your advice and we do all kinds

00:57.520 --> 01:03.600
of crazy stuff. There's gonna be a lot of goofs and a lot of pranks, and Justin's not here because

01:03.600 --> 01:09.040
he's on island time. This is gonna be like one of those episodes where everybody's like trapped

01:09.040 --> 01:14.880
in the broom closet, and we're like, but remember that time we rode that roller coaster, and like

01:14.880 --> 01:19.600
then we play a clip from that? It'll be a lot like that, except that we won't be talking between the

01:19.600 --> 01:25.760
clips, and we're not trapped anywhere, and Justin is, I don't know, probably having a margarita.

01:25.760 --> 01:28.880
He's not in the broom closet. He's not even here. It's like we said,

01:28.880 --> 01:32.960
man, remember that time Justin was here and we were able to record? Man,

01:32.960 --> 01:37.600
I wish we were all in a broom closet together. Folks, listen, in this episode, we're gonna

01:37.600 --> 01:42.400
bust out some of our favorite pranks and our favorite spoofs. And also some of our least

01:42.400 --> 01:47.520
favorite in this span was when Sad Lives was created. Oh my God, I haven't gone through my

01:47.520 --> 01:52.560
assigned episodes to pull out the classic bits yet. I feel like this is when we really matured

01:52.560 --> 01:58.000
as a podcast. When we stopped being polite and- Started talking about poop for 10 minutes.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.920
Started just being very rude, which is, I have a problem with that tagline now that I think about

02:03.920 --> 02:09.440
it, because it's like, you can be real and still be polite. Like that my sort of, my realness

02:10.000 --> 02:13.120
is my politeness, I feel like. They should have just said like,

02:13.120 --> 02:19.200
when we stopped being fakey fake bullshit people and started being even more bullshit people,

02:19.200 --> 02:23.120
but in an honest way. Or when we stopped being bullshit

02:23.120 --> 02:26.000
and we started being polite. That's even better.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.040
I would watch that show, The Polite World. Excuse me, Steven, did you eat my peanut butter?

02:31.040 --> 02:34.960
Oh, I did. I'm sorry, I thought it was mine. No, that's fine. Could you just pick some more up

02:34.960 --> 02:38.400
when you're at the store? Yeah, I totally will. Roll credits.

02:38.400 --> 02:42.480
Folks, we're gonna bust out some of our favorite goofs and our favorite pranks in this episode,

02:42.480 --> 02:46.960
and we hope you enjoy them. What is the range of episodes again, Travis?

02:46.960 --> 02:51.760
I believe 72 to 81. Oh, some really great stuff in there. Oh,

02:51.760 --> 02:59.120
man. 77? Forget about it. I forget everything we've ever said before like this mid-May,

03:00.080 --> 03:03.920
and that's not a, that's not a lie. I'm looking forward to hearing these episodes for the first

03:03.920 --> 03:08.640
time. I was really excited to hear Croco Swine in here. Completely forgotten about Croco Swine.

03:08.640 --> 03:12.480
Yeah. Well, spoiler alert, Croco Swine's coming. Folks, we're gonna bust out some of our favorite

03:12.480 --> 03:16.800
suits from our favorite pranks, and here they come, and we'll talk to you here in just a little bit.

03:16.800 --> 03:22.880
I'm sorry, like, can we take a step back here? Why is, why is like every romantic encounter that

03:22.880 --> 03:28.160
this girl has like Robert Redford in Indecent Proposal? Like, why is there be a proposition

03:28.160 --> 03:35.520
like, excuse me? There is $10,000 in my hotel room upstairs. You have to find it.

03:35.520 --> 03:42.800
Associate Reginald has a briefcase with $100,000. I am propositioning you.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.640
What accent is that?

03:44.640 --> 03:47.920
What? Have comic book guy have, uh, Hitchcock.

03:48.480 --> 03:48.980
Okay.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.520
It was really, really scary.

03:53.680 --> 03:55.840
Maybe that's why the guy is intimidated.

03:57.120 --> 03:57.520
Hello.

03:57.520 --> 04:06.160
I am unmarked, much like myself. No needle of tattoo has touched my skin. I am ready to make

04:06.160 --> 04:07.280
love to you.

04:07.280 --> 04:08.320
Oh, Jesus.

04:08.320 --> 04:09.760
I am so upset.

04:09.760 --> 04:12.320
Reginald, open the briefcase.

04:15.760 --> 04:20.560
You will see the bills are in Ugandan currency. They are untraceable.

04:21.280 --> 04:25.360
Oh, $100,000 in gold Cougarans.

04:25.360 --> 04:33.760
This is gold bullion. My associate, Reginald, will take this gold bullion to a deposit box

04:33.760 --> 04:41.520
of your selection. At that point, our brief fleeting lovemaking will commence.

04:41.520 --> 04:43.040
Oh, Jesus. Now I'm just thinking about-

04:43.040 --> 04:44.080
Where are you going?

04:44.640 --> 04:51.520
I'm thinking about being at a bar and then like the Lord of House Harkonnen from Dune like

04:51.520 --> 04:53.280
floating over it.

04:53.280 --> 04:56.400
Good evening. The spice is life.

04:57.440 --> 05:00.080
I have a briefcase of spice.

05:00.080 --> 05:01.360
Oh, Jesus.

05:02.080 --> 05:04.880
Derek, actually at the end there, there was some Borat thrown in.

05:06.720 --> 05:07.520
People seem to like that.

05:09.440 --> 05:17.680
So before we take a trip, I would like to throw out- Justin made the mistake of giving

05:17.680 --> 05:22.240
me time between the time when we were going to record the episode and the time when we

05:22.240 --> 05:26.480
actually did. So I played a game with our listeners and asked them for words that they

05:26.480 --> 05:28.240
would like to hear on the show.

05:28.240 --> 05:28.880
You made a Mad Libs.

05:28.880 --> 05:33.520
And I arranged those words into a short story that I would like Griffin to read now.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.600
Okay, so what I'm looking at is a Mad Lib that-

05:40.080 --> 05:42.480
It's a Mad Lib. Like that's not- Let's not split hairs.

05:43.280 --> 05:48.720
Yes. Sometimes we make bits on the show because I think it'll be funny. And then sometimes

05:48.720 --> 05:53.280
we make bits on the show to antagonize each other. For instance, monthly observances.

05:53.280 --> 05:54.160
I hate that bit.

05:56.240 --> 06:01.440
I think Travis kind of does too. Griffin inflicts it on us every fucking month.

06:01.440 --> 06:05.760
This was actually Justin's punishment for not being ready to record the call when he

06:05.760 --> 06:08.640
was supposed to. So now he has to hear this Mad Lib.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.160
I had something really important come up.

06:11.360 --> 06:13.200
Was it toddlers and tiaras?

06:13.200 --> 06:13.440
Yeah.

06:13.440 --> 06:21.520
Aiden Wood lost her foot in a logging accident and now she'd be able to perform.

06:23.920 --> 06:29.040
This is the epic and moist fable of Bumsey Clumhole and the Marshmallow debacle.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.160
Why am I doing this?

06:32.560 --> 06:33.440
Read away.

06:33.440 --> 06:33.920
Go stop now.

06:33.920 --> 06:37.920
Travis, this is making me hate you and our listeners who sent this shit in.

06:37.920 --> 06:38.880
I knew it.

06:38.880 --> 06:43.600
One fine and scrumptious day, Bumsey was hanging out with his funkalicious friend Batman.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.600
They were runny late for the big race.

06:46.560 --> 06:48.320
The thick freakness.

06:51.360 --> 06:56.160
They'd been watching the clock when suddenly everything got all timey wimey wibbly wobbly.

06:56.160 --> 06:57.280
There's the Doctor Who thing.

06:58.640 --> 07:03.440
So they leapt onto their Pegasus, Celestia Sprinkles, and sprang into action,

07:03.440 --> 07:05.520
only stopping to get a fish taco on the way.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.440
Slow down, yelled Batman.

07:07.440 --> 07:11.120
This is chafing my turgid front butt and giving me lavish thoughts.

07:12.240 --> 07:13.600
Oh, hogwash, yelled Bumsey.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.560
Stop being persnickety.

07:14.560 --> 07:15.440
This is funkalicious.

07:15.440 --> 07:20.080
Incredible, sighed Batman, but sadly the whole thing was a boondoggle.

07:20.080 --> 07:24.880
Bumsey died and Batman was left as the only living boy in New York.

07:25.600 --> 07:30.000
That was the end of it and we will never do that to you again, and I promise you that.

07:30.000 --> 07:39.840
I wrote a book in second grade called Grant Andrews Kid Cop that reads better than that

07:39.840 --> 07:40.640
thing that you made.

07:42.400 --> 07:43.600
Why did you do that to him?

07:44.480 --> 07:48.000
Why is it that you were trying to punish me but Griffin ends up catching the brunt of-

07:48.000 --> 07:49.120
Because it was humiliating.

07:49.120 --> 07:51.040
I said words in there that I would never say.

07:51.040 --> 07:51.840
Funkalicious?

07:52.800 --> 07:56.800
You realize that every word I say is like a precious treasure, right?

07:56.800 --> 08:01.680
And you just tarnished my streak of precious treasures.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.520
This one's actually old.

08:05.520 --> 08:06.880
I've been holding on to this one.

08:06.880 --> 08:10.160
I've had this arrow in my quiver for a long time in the cinema by Jacob Locker.

08:10.880 --> 08:11.520
Thank you, Jacob.

08:11.520 --> 08:13.840
It's by Yahoo Answers user James who asks,

08:14.800 --> 08:18.480
how can I make myself into a human peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

08:18.480 --> 08:24.480
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

08:24.480 --> 08:25.760
I like making messes.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.680
And I want to really do this.

08:31.680 --> 08:37.760
The first thing I want to do is get covered in a peanut butter type of mixture and then

08:37.760 --> 08:44.720
a jelly type of mixture and have like some giant bread made of smaller bread.

08:44.720 --> 08:50.480
And also, when I get the peanut butter mixture and the jelly mixture poured on me,

08:50.480 --> 08:57.040
she I lay on the bread and get it dumped on me or just stand up and have it poured on me.

08:57.040 --> 08:57.760
It's your vote.

08:57.760 --> 09:04.000
And last but not least, how could I make like a maybe runny liquidy peanut butter mix and

09:04.000 --> 09:05.440
running liquid jelly mix?

09:06.320 --> 09:10.400
That guys, that, that was all one one sentence.

09:10.400 --> 09:11.040
Oh, no.

09:11.040 --> 09:16.400
Oh, tell me what you guys think and how could I, how I could make a mess with this stuff.

09:16.400 --> 09:20.320
And I forgot to say that at the end, after I get the mixtures poured on me,

09:20.320 --> 09:25.040
I'm going to get two giant pieces of bread, cover it with regular PB&J,

09:25.040 --> 09:27.920
cover myself up and maybe roll around in it.

09:27.920 --> 09:30.160
Unleash the ideas and the creativeness.

09:30.160 --> 09:31.040
Ha ha ha.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.200
This will be so much fun and feel awesome.

09:34.080 --> 09:37.600
I'm right in thinking that there's an underlying and all the while I'm going to be jerking

09:37.600 --> 09:38.320
it so right.

09:38.320 --> 09:42.400
I'm going to jerk it in this runny liquidy jelly type mixture.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.560
Oh, and BT dubs.

09:44.560 --> 09:46.000
I'm just going to be jerking it.

09:46.560 --> 09:49.600
Danny is just one flag away from that trip to Universal Studios.

09:49.600 --> 09:52.720
He's made it through the gas fountain, made it through the car wash.

09:52.720 --> 09:56.400
Now he's just got to get this one last flag from a giant peanut butter jelly suit.

09:56.400 --> 09:59.520
And oh my God, is he masturbating?

10:00.400 --> 10:04.080
He's so excited about that Casio keyboard.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.600
That Casio keyboard.

10:05.600 --> 10:11.200
He has found the flag, he is using the flag as some sort of jerk it sheath.

10:14.400 --> 10:19.040
I'm Mark Summers and I quit television forever because I am yucked.

10:19.040 --> 10:20.000
I am retired.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.800
I have now have obsessive compulsive disorder.

10:22.800 --> 10:28.960
I know because of this child's lewd act, I am leaving the entertainment business.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.600
And that completes our Mark Summers origin story.

10:31.600 --> 10:37.920
Those flags, those flags are for, those are roller skate vouchers, not jerk it sheaths.

10:39.760 --> 10:42.400
Sir, sir, pardon.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.040
Good day.

10:44.240 --> 10:45.360
You win nothing.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.400
Hey Mark, you want to watch?

10:49.200 --> 10:51.120
Hey Mark, I double dare you.

10:53.680 --> 10:57.280
I would rather them not have a gift than have the gift of guilt,

10:57.280 --> 11:00.400
which is what you're giving them if you get them a present and they didn't get you one.

11:00.400 --> 11:04.720
Um, but there, you always run that risk of like, maybe they didn't think you were going

11:04.720 --> 11:05.760
to get them anything.

11:06.560 --> 11:11.280
And so now it's just this like unspoken, like, well, we didn't get anything for each other.

11:12.240 --> 11:12.720
I don't know.

11:12.720 --> 11:15.680
It's so tough because you don't want to make them feel bad, but at the same time,

11:16.400 --> 11:17.280
maybe you need to break the cycle.

11:17.280 --> 11:19.840
How is it going to make them feel bad if they get a present?

11:19.840 --> 11:20.160
How do you feel?

11:20.160 --> 11:21.440
Because they didn't get you a present.

11:21.440 --> 11:21.840
Fuck that.

11:21.840 --> 11:25.360
They'll be so excited to get a present that they'll just be like, Ooh, present.

11:25.360 --> 11:26.720
Who doesn't like a shiny present?

11:26.720 --> 11:29.440
Just go to, go to stop overthinking it.

11:29.440 --> 11:32.960
Just go to Pier 1 Imports and find one of those wicker basketballs.

11:32.960 --> 11:38.720
Imagine gift to the Magi and the woman's like, I, I sold my hair to get you this watch chain.

11:38.720 --> 11:39.440
He's like, Oh cool.

11:39.440 --> 11:40.560
That'll go great with my watch.

11:42.720 --> 11:43.360
Oh man.

11:43.360 --> 11:44.800
That was very thoughtful of you.

11:45.680 --> 11:47.520
But listen, I'm going to need a new lady.

11:47.520 --> 11:48.080
You're bald.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.600
Hey, I'm just looking at my watch.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.760
It looks like it's time to get a new girlfriend.

11:56.240 --> 11:58.160
Out of the way, Lex Luthor.

11:58.160 --> 12:03.920
Man, that trade-off is not very fair.

12:03.920 --> 12:04.560
Is it?

12:04.560 --> 12:07.040
Hey Vicky, me and Hellraiser split up.

12:10.160 --> 12:10.560
Yeah.

12:10.560 --> 12:12.240
I got a new chain too.

12:12.240 --> 12:12.480
Yeah.

12:12.480 --> 12:14.320
I got a new sweet ass watch chain.

12:14.320 --> 12:16.400
I said, there's, there's the door, Willy Willy.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.360
Thanks for the watch.

12:19.920 --> 12:20.560
Oh man.

12:21.280 --> 12:22.080
What horse shit?

12:22.080 --> 12:22.240
Yeah.

12:22.240 --> 12:22.960
I sold my watch.

12:22.960 --> 12:23.680
What did you do?

12:23.680 --> 12:24.720
Oh, you're bald now.

12:25.280 --> 12:26.080
That's rough.

12:26.080 --> 12:26.240
Yeah.

12:26.240 --> 12:28.160
But his watch isn't going to grow back.

12:28.160 --> 12:28.400
Yeah.

12:31.040 --> 12:31.680
That's true.

12:31.680 --> 12:31.840
Yeah.

12:31.840 --> 12:33.120
Cause he had his watch gland removed.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.520
Do you guys want a Yahoo answer?

12:35.520 --> 12:36.080
Yes.

12:36.080 --> 12:37.120
I have one.

12:37.680 --> 12:39.040
How did Griffin just say cinnamon?

12:39.920 --> 12:43.040
This one was sent in by Justin Russo.

12:43.840 --> 12:45.200
Thank you Justin Russo.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.360
You're a gentleman and a scholar.

12:47.360 --> 12:50.320
It's asked by Yahoo answers user Buck Peters who asks.

12:52.800 --> 12:53.440
Come on now.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.960
That's not a good start.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.160
What a power name.

12:56.960 --> 12:58.320
Buck Peters asks.

12:58.960 --> 12:59.920
Whatever he wants to.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.360
Is it weird to watch porn with nine other dudes with surround sound and order pizza for the event?

13:09.360 --> 13:10.160
Like with sports?

13:12.800 --> 13:15.040
Cause that's what's happening at our bachelor pad right now.

13:15.040 --> 13:16.720
We started off with four guys.

13:16.720 --> 13:19.920
Now the neighbor and his buddies came over and it's nine guys watching porn,

13:19.920 --> 13:21.840
drinking beer and eating pizza.

13:21.840 --> 13:24.880
If my buddy Seth and his two other buddies come over,

13:24.880 --> 13:27.120
that'll bring the tally of this party to 12 dudes.

13:27.840 --> 13:28.800
Oh my Jesus.

13:28.800 --> 13:29.840
There's a question mark.

13:29.840 --> 13:30.720
Like mathematically.

13:30.720 --> 13:31.120
Yeah.

13:31.120 --> 13:31.280
Yeah.

13:31.280 --> 13:31.760
You got it.

13:32.480 --> 13:35.840
Should we invite some girls to balance out a possible sausage fest?

13:37.280 --> 13:38.880
A possible sausage fest?

13:38.880 --> 13:43.520
You can invite girls from now until the end of linear time.

13:43.520 --> 13:46.640
Not one is going to darken the door of that party.

13:46.640 --> 13:47.760
So here's the setup.

13:47.760 --> 13:48.240
There's no-

13:48.240 --> 13:48.800
See you there?

13:48.800 --> 13:50.880
You use so many question marks in this question.

13:50.880 --> 13:53.280
Where question marks didn't need to be like,

13:53.280 --> 13:57.360
yeah, also you're eating pizza with probable sausage on it.

13:57.360 --> 13:58.640
I'm going to go ahead and say that's a sausage.

13:58.640 --> 14:00.640
This is like sausage Woodstock.

14:00.640 --> 14:00.880
Yeah.

14:00.880 --> 14:04.880
Like you've called all the sausage together for nine miles.

14:04.880 --> 14:06.560
And there's probably sausage on the TV too.

14:06.560 --> 14:07.680
Wouldn't you imagine?

14:07.680 --> 14:07.920
Yeah.

14:07.920 --> 14:08.480
Some dude-

14:09.280 --> 14:11.200
Do you know what my biggest problem with this setup is?

14:11.760 --> 14:13.680
The surround sound aspect.

14:13.680 --> 14:14.240
Yeah.

14:14.240 --> 14:14.800
What was that?

14:14.800 --> 14:15.360
Oh yeah.

14:15.360 --> 14:16.880
There's a dick right behind my head.

14:16.880 --> 14:19.120
I feel like there's just a dick on my shoulder.

14:19.120 --> 14:21.120
Is there someone gooshing behind my head?

14:22.880 --> 14:24.640
Philip, are you gooshing?

14:24.640 --> 14:24.960
Yuck.

14:24.960 --> 14:25.920
Oh, don't say that.

14:29.280 --> 14:31.680
How does this become like a regular like,

14:31.680 --> 14:33.680
it's Thursday, poor night again.

14:33.680 --> 14:36.320
Like, what the hell is the matter with-

14:36.320 --> 14:36.960
Don't you call it an event.

14:37.600 --> 14:38.480
Don't you call it an event.

14:38.480 --> 14:39.360
Like with sports.

14:40.160 --> 14:41.280
Only not with sports.

14:41.280 --> 14:45.440
Looks like that penis is winning against the vagina.

14:45.440 --> 14:49.200
He could go all the way.

14:49.200 --> 14:50.160
Surround sound.

14:51.120 --> 14:53.360
Let's look at it through the eyes of the pizza guy

14:53.360 --> 14:55.200
who rolls up and delivers your pizza.

14:55.200 --> 14:55.520
Yeah.

14:55.520 --> 14:58.160
And he swings over the door and he's just like,

14:58.160 --> 14:59.840
um, I'm going to go.

14:59.840 --> 15:00.880
I don't know what this is.

15:00.880 --> 15:02.480
There are porn sounds.

15:02.480 --> 15:05.280
There are porn sounds coming from every corner of your room.

15:06.160 --> 15:08.640
Is this like 9.1?

15:08.640 --> 15:10.160
Jesus, how many speakers are there?

15:10.160 --> 15:12.480
I heard your house gooshing from the Johnsons.

15:12.480 --> 15:15.280
Wait a minute.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.200
Wait one goddamn second.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.680
Can you please never say the phrase

15:19.680 --> 15:21.520
gooshing from the Johnsons again?

15:22.720 --> 15:24.720
I mean, I can't make any promises,

15:24.720 --> 15:25.520
but I'll do what I can.

15:25.520 --> 15:26.640
Psychically unpleasant.

15:29.120 --> 15:29.840
That bad, huh?

15:30.560 --> 15:33.280
I thought maybe it was a, I don't know, evocative.

15:34.240 --> 15:36.480
How about another one from Mr. Justin Russo?

15:36.480 --> 15:38.080
He really knocked it out of the park this week.

15:39.120 --> 15:40.080
Thank you, Justin Russo.

15:40.080 --> 15:44.240
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Vic, Philadelphia Freedom,

15:44.880 --> 15:48.720
who asks, this might be too gross.

15:48.720 --> 15:50.640
Let me know if it is and we'll do something else.

15:50.640 --> 15:52.720
How do you make a scrotum more attractive?

15:54.400 --> 15:55.760
I mean, if you leave it as is,

15:55.760 --> 15:58.080
it looks like a Velcro tennis ball rolled in pet hair.

15:58.960 --> 16:00.800
If you shave it, it looks like an orange

16:00.800 --> 16:02.640
that somebody forgot in the fridge for a year.

16:03.440 --> 16:04.880
How do you make it look any better?

16:04.880 --> 16:06.080
Serious answers only, please.

16:07.040 --> 16:09.680
You can make it look like a kitty with like face paint.

16:09.680 --> 16:10.960
What's the additional infographic?

16:10.960 --> 16:11.920
Additional details.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.120
Will you marry me, cat?

16:14.400 --> 16:16.240
So I don't know, maybe he's using this

16:16.240 --> 16:17.200
as like the worst proposal,

16:17.200 --> 16:19.440
like he was trying to genetically, scientifically

16:19.440 --> 16:22.240
come up with the worst proposal ever imaginable.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.640
Because this would be it.

16:24.640 --> 16:26.160
This is pretty high on the list.

16:27.360 --> 16:28.880
This is actually an easy one to answer.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.400
What you want to do is go up to,

16:30.400 --> 16:34.960
you go up and click layer and then click filter

16:34.960 --> 16:38.400
and then click artistic and then click scrotum.

16:38.400 --> 16:39.280
Uh-huh.

16:39.280 --> 16:45.600
And then click de-speckle, de-vein and uncheck smoothing.

16:46.640 --> 16:52.480
And you're just going to want to save that as a keyboard shape.

16:52.480 --> 16:56.480
To get the TIFF or JPEG file format.

16:59.040 --> 16:59.920
If you have a TIFF,

16:59.920 --> 17:04.640
you're going to want to check in laced hair

17:04.640 --> 17:06.480
and that's going to give you a look

17:06.480 --> 17:12.160
like the pubes are woven into like a dick dicky base.

17:12.160 --> 17:13.280
Yeah, yeah.

17:13.280 --> 17:14.960
It's going to be a really nice look.

17:14.960 --> 17:16.960
I tell you what, I usually just blur it.

17:16.960 --> 17:18.400
Blur, blur, blur, blur, blur.

17:18.400 --> 17:21.280
And then I slap a mosaic filter on it

17:21.280 --> 17:25.520
and then I print that and I use it as a sort of a basis

17:25.520 --> 17:26.720
for my stained glass work.

17:26.720 --> 17:28.240
You know, and we run into this a lot,

17:28.240 --> 17:30.880
but you guys are just so much more computer savvy than me.

17:30.880 --> 17:34.320
I just use paint and just kind of do a spray paint smile on it.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.480
Yeah, which is fine.

17:36.480 --> 17:37.680
That's good, I guess.

17:39.360 --> 17:40.640
I'm still using clip art.

17:40.640 --> 17:44.480
I've been looking into flash to like animate

17:44.480 --> 17:49.040
to just make it look like the left and right gonads

17:49.040 --> 17:51.840
are sort of going up and down as if it were walking down

17:51.840 --> 17:54.880
like a path, like a rose covered path.

17:54.880 --> 17:56.320
So maybe they're not any more attractive,

17:56.320 --> 17:58.080
but they're definitely more active.

17:58.080 --> 18:00.640
Yeah, well, and you can't spell attractive without active,

18:00.640 --> 18:01.840
you know, if you think about it.

18:01.840 --> 18:03.200
It's true, it's so true.

18:03.200 --> 18:05.040
Everybody get fit, just a reminder.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.960
You thought about maybe throwing a third ball in there?

18:10.800 --> 18:12.320
Giving something they haven't seen before.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.880
Just like that classic scene in Total Recall

18:14.880 --> 18:17.680
when that girl says, baby, you made me wish I was dead.

18:20.240 --> 18:21.840
I hate your third ball so much.

18:23.360 --> 18:26.800
Oh man, I don't think that there is a,

18:26.800 --> 18:29.360
I don't know, an equal thing for having three balls.

18:29.360 --> 18:33.600
It made me wish I had six fingers, I don't know.

18:33.600 --> 18:37.440
It made me wish I had left after our second date something.

18:37.440 --> 18:38.560
Can you have them removed?

18:39.840 --> 18:41.200
Can you have them moved?

18:41.760 --> 18:42.000
Yeah, moved.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Can you have them moved to a place in your body

18:44.000 --> 18:45.600
that's a little more discreet?

18:45.600 --> 18:46.800
How about on top?

18:47.440 --> 18:48.000
Stop it.

18:52.560 --> 18:53.920
Is that Gonzo down there?

18:53.920 --> 18:55.120
Is that Gonzo down there?

18:58.640 --> 19:00.080
He looks ridiculous.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.360
Oh, that's so crazy because mine looks like Rolf.

19:05.440 --> 19:08.160
Did you just put the balls up there or the whole thing?

19:08.160 --> 19:08.880
The whole kit and kaboom.

19:08.880 --> 19:11.280
I don't know, is it possible to just turn the whole thing upside down?

19:11.280 --> 19:12.560
That's what I'm wondering.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.080
I don't wanna do that.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.960
Can we turn it sideways?

19:16.960 --> 19:18.400
There's so many options.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.600
Then it looks quizzical.

19:21.760 --> 19:22.240
Interesting.

19:22.240 --> 19:23.120
I don't wanna think these things anymore.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.960
It's like when you were a kid and you cocked your,

19:25.680 --> 19:26.720
sorry for the word choice,

19:26.720 --> 19:30.240
cocked your baseball hat to the side to let people know that you were street.

19:30.240 --> 19:31.520
Oh, you got rally balls.

19:31.520 --> 19:32.020
Yeah.

19:33.040 --> 19:33.920
Come on, Reds.

19:35.680 --> 19:38.160
I turned my dick 35 degrees to the left for you.

19:39.120 --> 19:40.000
Come on, Gomez.

19:40.720 --> 19:41.120
Hit it.

19:42.720 --> 19:46.960
Hey, guys, I'm an avid believer in the philosophy of waiting as long as possible

19:46.960 --> 19:50.800
to wash a pair of jeans for the sake of preserving the color in them.

19:50.800 --> 19:54.960
I will often go a few months without washing them.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.120
The jeans I wear are usually dark in color,

19:57.120 --> 20:00.000
so they do not show food and or coffee stains,

20:00.000 --> 20:03.360
nor do they noticeably smell from a distance.

20:03.360 --> 20:08.720
My main fear of doing this is that those who see me on a day-to-day basis in work

20:08.720 --> 20:13.360
setting will start to notice that I'm re-wearing my jeans every day for weeks on end

20:14.000 --> 20:16.880
or that I am a slob or a hobo.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.320
Is this a weird thing to do?

20:18.960 --> 20:20.400
Are my fears justified?

20:20.400 --> 20:24.480
That's from dirty denim in Detroit.

20:24.480 --> 20:26.240
That was my favorite Bruce Springsteen album.

20:27.280 --> 20:28.480
Hey, hey, buddy.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.280
You're a slob.

20:31.280 --> 20:32.000
No, Travis.

20:32.640 --> 20:33.680
Hey, hey.

20:33.680 --> 20:39.840
No, here's when your qualifiers are, they don't noticeably smell from a distance.

20:39.840 --> 20:40.320
Yeah.

20:40.320 --> 20:44.080
And they're dark, so they don't show coffee or food stains.

20:44.080 --> 20:46.160
Not that they don't have coffee or food stains.

20:46.160 --> 20:46.800
Well, sure.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.640
A man's going to spill coffee on his pants.

20:48.640 --> 20:49.680
That's gravity.

20:49.680 --> 20:52.160
Well, but third is, a few months?

20:52.160 --> 20:56.880
Is he saying that, like, do you think he means he wears them, like, in a month,

20:56.880 --> 20:58.880
three times spread out over a month?

20:58.880 --> 21:00.000
Or he's, like, every day for a month?

21:00.000 --> 21:00.960
No way, man.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.760
I think these are his off-court buddies, and he's wearing them every day.

21:03.760 --> 21:05.440
I mean, if you're going to work in those...

21:06.400 --> 21:08.000
Yeah, he's also wearing them on the court.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.360
They're off- and on-court buddies.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.040
Yeah, they're just his constant buddies.

21:11.040 --> 21:12.240
They're just his constant buddies.

21:12.240 --> 21:12.880
Ever buddies.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.240
They're his Ever Buddies.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.440
There are many ways to preserve...

21:15.440 --> 21:17.360
Have you worn those Ever Buddies jeans?

21:17.360 --> 21:18.000
The new brand?

21:18.000 --> 21:19.680
Yeah.

21:19.680 --> 21:20.160
They're nice.

21:20.160 --> 21:21.280
They have so many pockets.

21:21.840 --> 21:23.760
Your ass looks terrific in those Ever Buddies.

21:23.760 --> 21:28.000
They have little inserts for Glade plug-ins that you can just, like, slide right in there,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.880
and then the smell isn't noticeable from a distance.

21:30.880 --> 21:32.480
They have a Teflon weave.

21:32.480 --> 21:33.360
It's pretty nice.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.760
It really catches the stink and holds it in.

21:35.760 --> 21:37.680
So, man, watch out when you take it off.

21:37.680 --> 21:39.200
There is a visible cloud.

21:41.920 --> 21:45.280
You know, I hear people using those instead of security deposit boxes now.

21:45.280 --> 21:46.960
You just put them in your Ever Buddies and...

21:46.960 --> 21:48.880
This is where I keep my stink and my bouillon.

21:51.680 --> 21:52.560
In my jeans vault.

21:55.680 --> 21:59.040
Why don't you just get, instead of expensive jeans, more jeans?

21:59.040 --> 22:00.960
And get, like, a wider rotation.

22:00.960 --> 22:01.760
Double jeans.

22:02.960 --> 22:04.480
Get them double jeans.

22:04.480 --> 22:05.120
Have you worn...

22:05.840 --> 22:08.800
Have you worn double Ever Buddies?

22:08.800 --> 22:11.520
Have you worn those double-jean Ever Buddies from Gap?

22:12.800 --> 22:14.880
It's basically like an airlock system.

22:14.880 --> 22:16.960
They cost $300,000.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.560
Your dick will suffocate.

22:21.360 --> 22:22.480
They are airtight.

22:23.520 --> 22:26.800
They keep the last remaining sample of smallpox in there.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.640
That's in my Ever Buddies.

22:29.760 --> 22:30.400
My hermetically sealed jeans vault.

22:30.400 --> 22:32.960
More or less, it's like an iron lung from the waist down.

22:34.480 --> 22:38.080
I'm not even sure that we understand the concept of Ever Buddy jeans vaults anymore.

22:39.520 --> 22:41.120
Straight up, I'm going to call you guys out.

22:41.120 --> 22:45.520
So, what is the most random, weirdest thing that you've ever gotten choked up over?

22:48.080 --> 22:53.360
There was a Staples commercial where the dad is at the store and he says,

22:53.360 --> 22:56.560
we have to buy all these supplies and they're for the kids.

22:56.560 --> 22:57.680
And his wife's a teacher.

22:57.680 --> 23:01.040
And she's like, well, the school doesn't have money this year.

23:01.040 --> 23:05.920
And then she sees him at another register later, even though he was upset.

23:05.920 --> 23:08.640
And he's buying some supplies for the class.

23:08.640 --> 23:09.520
Oh, man.

23:09.520 --> 23:12.160
I want you to know, I actually just got choked up.

23:12.160 --> 23:14.720
Just listening to you tell about the story, that's beautiful.

23:14.720 --> 23:17.120
I'm getting worked up again, the Staples commercial.

23:18.560 --> 23:19.520
Any more?

23:19.520 --> 23:22.480
Now that I'm an old man, any Christmas commercials?

23:22.480 --> 23:24.160
Literally, any Christmas commercials.

23:25.760 --> 23:28.000
For me, it's that Zales commercial.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.480
No, it's Kay, Kay Jewelers, where they're in the cabin.

23:31.120 --> 23:35.680
And the girl and the guy are standing there and the lightning strikes.

23:35.680 --> 23:38.080
And he holds her and he's like, don't worry, I'm here.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.560
I'll always be here.

23:40.560 --> 23:41.680
And he gives her the thing.

23:41.680 --> 23:44.000
And I cry because that woman's about to be murdered.

23:45.680 --> 23:47.920
She's about to get murdered in the cabin and all of her friends

23:47.920 --> 23:49.360
and family will never see her again.

23:49.360 --> 23:54.160
I gotta call bullshit because I opened my heart with that Staples commercial revelation

23:54.160 --> 23:55.600
and you went for a gag.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.440
And I had to call Shenanigans on it.

23:57.440 --> 23:59.520
You want to know what commercials I've cried at?

23:59.520 --> 24:00.000
No, I want to-

24:00.000 --> 24:00.880
You want to know mine?

24:00.880 --> 24:02.800
This is an embarrassing deep dark secret.

24:03.440 --> 24:03.940
Okay.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.200
Katy Perry's Firework.

24:07.200 --> 24:07.700
Fuck you.

24:09.120 --> 24:09.600
What?

24:09.600 --> 24:10.960
Wait, hold on.

24:10.960 --> 24:12.800
No more questions today, kids.

24:12.800 --> 24:14.080
Hold on one second, Travis.

24:14.800 --> 24:17.600
Was it because the song played right after you

24:17.600 --> 24:20.080
won the season finale of America's Next Top Model?

24:20.960 --> 24:23.040
No, wait, you weren't on America's Next Top Model.

24:23.760 --> 24:27.040
I was having a particularly rough, sleepy day.

24:27.040 --> 24:30.240
I was at the end of like a hundred hour work week, like I often do.

24:30.240 --> 24:38.320
And I just was singing at the top of my lungs but saying, I'm a firework and it was particularly moving.

24:38.320 --> 24:40.880
And now I wish I would have just kept that one to myself.

24:40.880 --> 24:44.560
I don't know if it's better if you're joking or not.

24:44.560 --> 24:46.800
Like I can't, I can't know.

24:46.800 --> 24:47.920
You can never tell me.

24:48.560 --> 24:51.280
Actually, no, I need you to tell me this is a joke right now.

24:51.280 --> 24:53.040
I need you to tell me you're kidding.

24:53.040 --> 24:58.320
No, I like the picture of a single tear rolling down your paint covered face

24:58.320 --> 25:01.680
and then resting gently in the nestles of your beard.

25:01.680 --> 25:03.760
You are a firework, Travis.

25:03.760 --> 25:05.600
Don't ever let anybody-

25:05.600 --> 25:06.480
That is true.

25:06.480 --> 25:07.920
You are a firework.

25:07.920 --> 25:13.040
I've long thought when Travis McElroy springs to mind, it's with a trail of sparks behind him

25:13.040 --> 25:15.600
because he, God damn it, he's a firework.

25:16.560 --> 25:18.960
You know what the worst part about that is too?

25:18.960 --> 25:20.400
Yeah, I do, Travis.

25:20.400 --> 25:21.920
I know what the worst part is.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.520
I know what the worst part is, Travis.

25:23.520 --> 25:24.160
I do.

25:24.160 --> 25:25.360
I do know the worst part.

25:25.360 --> 25:27.040
It's the part that it is it.

25:27.040 --> 25:29.280
It is the thing that it is.

25:29.280 --> 25:30.320
The fact that it is that.

25:30.320 --> 25:31.520
The thing it is?

25:31.520 --> 25:33.200
The thing it is is the worst thing.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.120
It is the thing and then you do it.

25:36.320 --> 25:38.320
Like you've heard the song, right?

25:39.040 --> 25:41.040
You didn't just cry at the idea of it.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.000
Like you heard the song.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.880
I want you guys to know I'm crying right now.

25:44.880 --> 25:45.600
So I changed it.

25:45.600 --> 25:49.680
That's the last thing I got choked up by you guys being mean.

25:49.680 --> 25:50.640
I like to cry.

25:50.640 --> 25:51.920
Baby, I'm a firework.

25:51.920 --> 25:56.960
How dare you talk to a firework like that?

25:56.960 --> 25:59.440
Do you guys ever just think about sad things

25:59.440 --> 26:00.960
to try and get a good cry out?

26:00.960 --> 26:03.760
I didn't until about 30 seconds ago.

26:03.760 --> 26:06.160
Now I got all the sad things I need to last me forever.

26:08.560 --> 26:10.080
His crying feels so good, I think.

26:11.280 --> 26:12.880
It's like jerking it for your eyes.

26:15.440 --> 26:17.680
Forcing a cry is like jerking it for your emotions.

26:17.680 --> 26:19.040
Well, have you ever heard someone say that

26:19.040 --> 26:22.240
anyone ever, when you hear someone say it's a tear jerker?

26:28.800 --> 26:30.480
You know, there are big problem in Cape Canaveral.

26:31.040 --> 26:33.920
Down in Florida, you'll see them rolling around.

26:33.920 --> 26:36.560
Florida makes me so fucking angry

26:36.560 --> 26:38.480
the way they treat animals down there.

26:38.480 --> 26:40.480
Yeah, they throw alligators in sewers.

26:40.480 --> 26:43.360
They throw feral pigs out in pig bins.

26:43.360 --> 26:45.040
They throw alligators at pigs.

26:46.480 --> 26:47.920
They make pig gators.

26:47.920 --> 26:49.120
They make gator pigs.

26:49.120 --> 26:51.840
They put birds in slingshots and then throw them at pigs.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.520
Crocoswine!

26:55.200 --> 26:57.120
The monster I just invented is Crocoswine.

26:59.120 --> 26:59.520
That's it.

27:00.320 --> 27:01.760
I don't have a joke, I just wanted to-

27:01.760 --> 27:03.760
He's got the teeth of a gator.

27:03.760 --> 27:05.120
The ears of a pig.

27:05.120 --> 27:09.120
He's got tusks and tusks and tusks and back ridges.

27:10.480 --> 27:11.600
Like the crocodile does.

27:11.600 --> 27:12.800
And he loves you.

27:12.800 --> 27:14.400
And he loves you so much.

27:14.400 --> 27:15.280
Give him a kiss.

27:15.280 --> 27:15.760
No, don't.

27:15.760 --> 27:19.360
He's got so many tusks.

27:19.360 --> 27:22.080
Crocoswine, tusks, and ridges.

27:22.080 --> 27:23.520
Don't let him bite your face.

27:24.720 --> 27:27.520
He's got a tail and another tail that's curlier.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.600
That's the one that Grant's wishes if you cut it off.

27:32.480 --> 27:35.040
He will give you bacon and boots.

27:37.360 --> 27:38.480
I'm gonna be honest.

27:38.480 --> 27:40.720
I thought Crocoswine would be much more intimidating,

27:40.720 --> 27:42.160
but he sounds pretty cool.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.080
I wanna hang out with him.

27:44.080 --> 27:46.720
If it weren't for all the tusks, he'd make a great home pet.

27:46.720 --> 27:48.720
If it weren't for all those genie tusks.

27:48.720 --> 27:51.120
He's like the giving tree of feral animals.

27:51.120 --> 27:55.760
He's gonna give you bacon and boots with his meat and his skin.

27:56.640 --> 27:59.040
And he'll make you sweats penicillin, which is nice.

27:59.600 --> 28:03.680
Hey, have you guys checked out my new double crusty double gene

28:03.680 --> 28:06.400
everybody vaults made of Crocoswine skin?

28:06.400 --> 28:08.640
That's a jiblin Crocoswine.

28:08.640 --> 28:15.280
Yeah, they're the ultimate callback pants.

28:15.280 --> 28:20.320
Is it okay to bring reading material into a group restroom?

28:20.880 --> 28:23.680
Is it okay to bring a Kindle into any restroom?

28:24.960 --> 28:26.560
Especially a group one.

28:26.560 --> 28:28.080
That's from bored in the bathroom.

28:28.080 --> 28:28.720
There's so many.

28:28.720 --> 28:29.440
Oh, that's easy.

28:29.440 --> 28:30.240
No and no.

28:30.960 --> 28:33.200
Well, there's so many questions here.

28:33.200 --> 28:40.080
The first being what isn't a group restroom?

28:40.080 --> 28:42.080
God, I would love a private restroom.

28:42.080 --> 28:44.160
This is this is Jeremy's bathroom.

28:44.800 --> 28:46.640
No one can come in here but Jeremy.

28:46.640 --> 28:48.800
You gotta like fingerprint lock to get in.

28:49.360 --> 28:51.120
Man, that would be fucking great though, wouldn't it?

28:51.760 --> 28:52.800
That would be so good.

28:53.360 --> 28:58.000
I would also like to pause it like to go, you know, true to the name

28:58.000 --> 28:59.520
and have an actual group restroom.

29:00.320 --> 29:02.320
And I'm just like, everybody goes in at the same time.

29:02.320 --> 29:03.360
It's like, let's do this.

29:03.360 --> 29:04.400
Well, what are you reading?

29:04.400 --> 29:05.680
They have those, Travis.

29:05.680 --> 29:06.240
They have those.

29:06.240 --> 29:07.120
They're called restroom.

29:07.120 --> 29:08.960
No, I'm saying like, get rid of the walls and everything.

29:08.960 --> 29:09.520
Oh, you're talking.

29:09.520 --> 29:11.200
Okay, you're a kind of open plan.

29:11.200 --> 29:12.640
That's the worst thing I've ever heard.

29:12.640 --> 29:14.240
Like, done by Frank Lloyd Wright, you know?

29:15.040 --> 29:16.080
This is my bathroom falling water.

29:16.080 --> 29:18.000
Frank Lloyd Wright was fucking nasty.

29:18.000 --> 29:18.500
But I'm...

29:20.960 --> 29:22.800
I'm making some falling water over here.

29:24.800 --> 29:25.760
That was a Frank Lloyd Wright joke.

29:25.760 --> 29:27.840
You know, he actually built a house like that.

29:27.840 --> 29:30.400
That was like based on a desert and there were no walls

29:30.400 --> 29:32.880
and nothing separating like the kitchen and bedroom and bathroom.

29:32.880 --> 29:33.280
Yeah.

29:33.280 --> 29:34.720
Like just wherever you were in the house,

29:34.720 --> 29:36.240
you could see every other part of the house.

29:36.240 --> 29:37.040
I think that's gross.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.800
The toilet was right in the middle of the living room

29:38.800 --> 29:40.640
because he was so fucking nasty.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.160
Frank Lloyd Wright, Frank Lloyd Dirty Boy.

29:45.280 --> 29:46.240
Frank Lloyd wrong.

29:46.880 --> 29:49.520
Frank Lloyd Dirty Boy sounds like a pretty good hip hop name.

29:50.560 --> 29:51.760
So like Soulja Boy, tell him.

29:53.040 --> 29:54.640
Frank Lloyd Dirty Boy.

29:56.160 --> 29:57.360
It's got a good cadence to it.

29:58.240 --> 29:59.120
I'm not sure.

29:59.120 --> 30:02.720
It's... I don't think there's a big problem with it.

30:02.720 --> 30:05.760
I think that if you are carrying a mag...

30:05.760 --> 30:06.960
Like let's say a magazine.

30:09.120 --> 30:10.400
If you're carrying a magazine,

30:10.400 --> 30:12.960
I think it's okay to have one in the bathroom.

30:12.960 --> 30:17.440
I don't think it's okay to be spotted carrying one to the bathroom.

30:17.440 --> 30:18.880
Yeah, I think it says too much like,

30:18.880 --> 30:21.280
hey, I'm gonna go settle in for a while.

30:21.280 --> 30:22.160
I'm getting cozy.

30:22.160 --> 30:22.560
Yeah.

30:22.560 --> 30:22.800
Yeah.

30:23.840 --> 30:25.920
If you need me for like the next 20 minutes,

30:25.920 --> 30:26.720
you know where I'll be.

30:26.720 --> 30:28.720
A Kindle, absolutely not.

30:28.720 --> 30:30.560
Because if you drop that between your legs,

30:30.560 --> 30:31.840
it electrifies the water,

30:31.840 --> 30:34.160
and the water might splash up and shock your gooch.

30:34.800 --> 30:35.040
Yeah.

30:36.720 --> 30:37.520
That's science.

30:37.520 --> 30:38.080
Science.

30:38.080 --> 30:43.360
That's scientific dispiration of electricity

30:44.240 --> 30:46.400
immersed in water splashed on gooch.

30:47.120 --> 30:49.200
The reason I would never use a Kindle in the bathroom

30:49.200 --> 30:51.520
is because you're paying a lot of money for that

30:51.520 --> 30:52.800
and for that service,

30:52.800 --> 30:54.960
and then that's always gonna be your poop Kindle.

30:54.960 --> 30:55.360
Yeah.

30:55.360 --> 30:58.400
I like to leave my iPhone 4 outside of the restroom

30:58.400 --> 30:59.600
whenever I use it.

30:59.600 --> 31:00.560
You stay right here.

31:00.560 --> 31:01.680
I'll be right back.

31:01.680 --> 31:03.120
I don't let anybody steal you.

31:03.120 --> 31:04.080
Don't, yeah.

31:04.080 --> 31:04.960
Make sure you scream.

31:05.680 --> 31:07.120
Do not wander off.

31:07.120 --> 31:07.600
I don't know.

31:07.600 --> 31:10.800
I think that it's fine to bring material in,

31:11.600 --> 31:15.120
but how much time are you spending in this bathroom?

31:15.120 --> 31:17.440
I don't do anything in the restroom.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.920
And let's try and keep this as not gross as possible.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.040
When I'm in the restroom,

31:21.040 --> 31:23.520
I'm doing restroom stuff and I'm out.

31:23.520 --> 31:25.280
I don't bring my Game Boy in there.

31:26.560 --> 31:27.520
I don't bring my Game Boy.

31:27.520 --> 31:29.920
I don't have a Big John's Bathroom Buddy

31:29.920 --> 31:31.120
or whatever it's called.

31:31.120 --> 31:32.400
I just get in there, I get it done,

31:32.400 --> 31:34.160
and then I leave and I go do other things.

31:36.480 --> 31:39.120
Justin's laughing because Justin fucking posts up,

31:39.120 --> 31:40.480
like brings the TV in.

31:41.360 --> 31:42.400
Bearcades the door.

31:42.400 --> 31:43.040
Yeah, he's like,

31:43.040 --> 31:44.320
I'm watching Man vs. Food.

31:44.320 --> 31:45.440
I can't leave, middle F.

31:46.720 --> 31:48.320
I'm halfway through this through.

31:48.320 --> 31:49.680
What am I supposed to do?

31:49.680 --> 31:51.840
Man vs. Food would be an ironic choice

31:51.840 --> 31:53.680
because you're always losing into that.

31:54.560 --> 31:56.000
God bless it.

31:56.000 --> 32:00.880
There should be a show called

32:00.880 --> 32:02.720
Seriously, Man vs. Food.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.320
That's just him on the restroom

32:04.320 --> 32:06.480
after he just ate 36 chili dogs.

32:08.480 --> 32:09.680
That's the thing they never tell you

32:09.680 --> 32:11.280
about Man vs. Food.

32:11.280 --> 32:13.840
In the end, the food always escapes the fight.

32:14.400 --> 32:17.360
If I don't bring something into the bathroom,

32:17.360 --> 32:21.360
what I'm saying is I really want to focus

32:21.360 --> 32:22.160
on what I'm doing.

32:22.160 --> 32:22.480
Yeah, you should.

32:22.480 --> 32:23.840
I can focus on the sin.

32:23.840 --> 32:24.340
Yeah.

32:24.340 --> 32:27.060
Yeah, how are you not like buckling down

32:27.060 --> 32:28.580
and just turning it in and get out?

32:28.580 --> 32:30.260
What kind of dirty boys are you?

32:30.260 --> 32:32.420
I like to distract myself from that evil

32:32.420 --> 32:34.100
and you guys like to really like-

32:34.100 --> 32:36.820
I run my bathroom like a fucking pit crew.

32:36.820 --> 32:37.780
I am in and out.

32:37.780 --> 32:38.980
I got a stopwatch going

32:40.420 --> 32:41.220
and I'm out.

32:41.220 --> 32:42.580
What happens down there?

32:43.460 --> 32:48.100
I don't know what kind of situation you have.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.540
It just doesn't happen.

32:50.660 --> 32:52.900
You know, you got to make it happen

32:52.900 --> 32:55.220
and I can't, I can't-

32:55.220 --> 32:59.940
I feel like magazines are the epidurals

32:59.940 --> 33:01.860
of the bowel movement process.

33:01.860 --> 33:04.900
You need to make sure you're dilated comfortably.

33:04.900 --> 33:05.700
Right, exactly.

33:16.740 --> 33:18.420
Real quick, we want to take a break

33:18.420 --> 33:19.700
and talk about some of the sponsors

33:19.700 --> 33:20.740
of this week's episode.

33:20.740 --> 33:22.420
Our favorites, your favorites.

33:22.420 --> 33:23.300
They're back again.

33:23.300 --> 33:24.500
Don't call it a comeback.

33:24.500 --> 33:27.300
Kind of a best of advertisements.

33:27.300 --> 33:28.740
I mean, I would agree with you, Griffin.

33:28.740 --> 33:32.180
Nature Box is everybody's favorite snacking alternative.

33:32.180 --> 33:34.420
I remember when they put Hostess out of business.

33:34.420 --> 33:36.740
They put Cookies out of business.

33:36.740 --> 33:38.500
They put Graham crackers out of business.

33:38.500 --> 33:39.700
They put sugar.

33:39.700 --> 33:40.980
Cookies brand Cookies?

33:40.980 --> 33:43.460
Yeah, everybody now is like, Cookies?

33:43.460 --> 33:43.780
What?

33:44.740 --> 33:46.900
That's because Nature Box Snacks is here

33:46.900 --> 33:49.780
with zero artificial flavors, colors, or sweeteners.

33:49.780 --> 33:50.980
Zero grams trans fat

33:50.980 --> 33:52.980
and no high fructose corn syrup.

33:52.980 --> 33:54.260
So like, Cookie brand Cookies

33:54.260 --> 33:56.900
can keep their fucking corn syrup to themselves.

33:56.900 --> 33:57.540
Oh, they would.

33:57.540 --> 33:59.300
But that business, as you just said,

33:59.300 --> 34:00.340
is no longer in operation.

34:00.340 --> 34:01.940
And now it's just an empty building

34:01.940 --> 34:04.100
full of corn syrup and artificial colors.

34:04.740 --> 34:06.180
If you go to naturebox.com,

34:06.180 --> 34:08.180
you can get some mini Belgian waffles.

34:08.180 --> 34:10.340
You can get some strawberry lemonade fruit stars.

34:10.340 --> 34:12.100
You can get sweet and salty nut medley.

34:12.100 --> 34:13.620
And listen, all that's great.

34:13.620 --> 34:14.900
But they have a snack

34:14.900 --> 34:16.580
that we just got in our box yesterday

34:16.580 --> 34:18.900
that is my favorite snack.

34:18.900 --> 34:19.860
I'm excited.

34:19.860 --> 34:20.420
I'm excited.

34:20.420 --> 34:20.820
What is it?

34:20.820 --> 34:22.900
It's the Asiago cheese crisps.

34:22.900 --> 34:26.580
I could eat five bags of those in one sitting.

34:26.580 --> 34:27.620
They're incredible.

34:27.620 --> 34:28.660
They're like the best.

34:28.660 --> 34:31.140
They actually taste like cheese

34:32.180 --> 34:34.180
and not just like processed cheese powder,

34:34.180 --> 34:35.780
which don't get me wrong, is incredible.

34:35.780 --> 34:37.300
But these taste like cheese.

34:37.300 --> 34:38.900
You could put these out at a party

34:38.900 --> 34:40.020
and people wouldn't be like,

34:40.020 --> 34:41.540
ooh, it's like Cheetos.

34:41.540 --> 34:43.620
No, this is like classy ass shit

34:43.620 --> 34:45.860
and it's delicious and everybody loves it.

34:45.860 --> 34:50.820
So if you eat five bags of Asiago cheese crisps,

34:52.020 --> 34:53.940
is that okay because it's nature box?

34:53.940 --> 34:56.340
Is this a food that is actively healing you?

34:56.340 --> 34:57.780
Yeah, it makes you healthier.

34:57.780 --> 35:00.660
It's like taking underdog's power pill

35:00.660 --> 35:02.100
and you get real buff

35:02.100 --> 35:04.660
for about 30 seconds per cheese crisp.

35:04.660 --> 35:06.260
Did you know those were Xanny bars?

35:06.260 --> 35:07.060
I knew it.

35:07.060 --> 35:08.740
He was popping Xanny bars

35:08.740 --> 35:10.420
and just like whacking out of his butt.

35:10.420 --> 35:11.540
Man, I wanna watch that.

35:11.540 --> 35:12.580
Like, where are they now?

35:13.380 --> 35:15.140
He's dead, he died.

35:15.140 --> 35:16.020
Underdog's dead?

35:16.020 --> 35:18.100
Well, he only lived 15 years anyways.

35:18.100 --> 35:20.020
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

35:20.020 --> 35:21.460

35:28.340 --> 35:29.300

35:29.300 --> 35:32.500
So you've eaten 44 bags of Asiago cheese crisps

35:32.500 --> 35:34.500
in one wonderful afternoon.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.180
One might say the best afternoon of your life.

35:36.180 --> 35:38.100
You've gotten some kind of trophy,

35:38.100 --> 35:39.380
at least a plaque.

35:39.380 --> 35:40.580
Oh, I'll tell you what else you've gotten,

35:40.580 --> 35:41.940
a 14 pack.

35:41.940 --> 35:43.220
You are ripped,

35:43.220 --> 35:46.980
your delts and your trelts and your svelts,

35:46.980 --> 35:50.420
which your svelts is actually my sort of new name

35:50.420 --> 35:52.180
I'm trying to get going for your sphincter.

35:52.180 --> 35:52.500
Okay.

35:53.620 --> 35:54.180
You got a really-

35:54.180 --> 35:55.700
You got that svelte sphincter.

35:55.700 --> 35:59.060
You got a very muscly fibrous svelte

35:59.620 --> 36:01.780
and you're looking so right.

36:01.780 --> 36:02.900
You're gonna need something to put

36:02.900 --> 36:05.060
on that taut, rigid body.

36:05.060 --> 36:06.900
Well, I could just put on some terrible,

36:06.900 --> 36:08.660
terrible underpants that I bought,

36:08.660 --> 36:10.500
like, I don't know, at Target

36:10.500 --> 36:12.500
that wear out after being on my body

36:12.500 --> 36:14.340
for 30 seconds and chafe really bad.

36:14.340 --> 36:14.660
Yeah, sure.

36:14.660 --> 36:15.140
Is that what you mean?

36:15.140 --> 36:15.860
Yeah, that's what I mean.

36:15.860 --> 36:17.300
And then you'll go to your job

36:17.300 --> 36:19.460
as a clown at the circus.

36:20.820 --> 36:22.180
And show my underpants?

36:22.180 --> 36:24.180
Yeah, instead, I want you to go to MeUndies.

36:24.180 --> 36:24.820
Oh, okay.

36:24.820 --> 36:27.300
And MeUndies is gonna get you underwear

36:27.300 --> 36:30.020
that is the world's most comfortable underwear.

36:30.020 --> 36:31.860
Not only the world's most comfortable underwear,

36:31.860 --> 36:34.340
the world's most humpable underwear.

36:34.340 --> 36:35.940
You are, when you wear these,

36:35.940 --> 36:39.220
oh my gosh, you're gonna start giving off a pheromone

36:39.220 --> 36:40.820
that nobody's gonna understand.

36:40.820 --> 36:41.380
It is going to be-

36:41.380 --> 36:44.500
Miles around people will come to hump you.

36:45.060 --> 36:46.260
You'll put these on and it'll be like,

36:46.260 --> 36:51.300
pfft, a giant mushroom cloud comes out of your body

36:51.300 --> 36:52.580
as soon as you put these on,

36:52.580 --> 36:55.060
and then everyone under the effect of that mushroom cloud

36:55.060 --> 36:55.300
is gonna come get a hump.

36:55.300 --> 36:56.660
Do you remember the hit film,

36:56.660 --> 37:00.020
the hit Sandra Bullock film, Love Potion Number Nine?

37:00.020 --> 37:01.140
It'll be like that,

37:01.940 --> 37:04.500
except without the people of your same gender

37:04.500 --> 37:06.500
wanting to kill you for using it.

37:06.500 --> 37:08.740
Do you remember that Sandra Bullock film

37:08.740 --> 37:11.460
where she was living a week out of order

37:11.460 --> 37:13.220
and her husband died during that week?

37:13.220 --> 37:14.020
The Blind Side.

37:15.220 --> 37:17.780
I think it was called The Blind Side.

37:17.780 --> 37:20.740
Anyway, MeUndies is gonna get you all sexed up

37:20.740 --> 37:22.260
with some sexy, sexy underwear.

37:22.260 --> 37:23.300
And it's not just for guys.

37:23.300 --> 37:25.620
They just launched the All of Me Women's Collection,

37:25.620 --> 37:27.460
which is a four-piece line of undies

37:27.460 --> 37:29.620
designed specifically for the female body

37:29.620 --> 37:33.940
and all of its inscrutable, insatial, insatial?

37:33.940 --> 37:34.740
That's a new one.

37:35.940 --> 37:37.060
I'm wearing MeUndies right now

37:37.060 --> 37:38.900
and it is allowing me to generate words

37:38.900 --> 37:40.580
that have never been spoken before.

37:40.580 --> 37:41.300
My mind is open.

37:41.300 --> 37:43.460
I love that MeUndies copy here has indicated

37:43.460 --> 37:45.380
that when it came to making guys underpants,

37:45.380 --> 37:46.260
like they got it.

37:46.260 --> 37:47.860
They got it in one, day one.

37:47.860 --> 37:50.500
They were like, oh, two legs, place for balls,

37:50.500 --> 37:51.780
cover the butt, got it.

37:51.780 --> 37:52.260
And then they're like,

37:52.260 --> 37:53.620
should we start working on women's body?

37:53.620 --> 37:55.380
It's like, oh, that's complex.

37:55.380 --> 37:57.060
We're gonna get our scientists on this.

37:58.020 --> 37:59.060
We've read this a lot now,

37:59.060 --> 38:00.580
but this is the first time this has stuck out to me,

38:00.580 --> 38:02.180
a four-piece line of undies.

38:02.180 --> 38:04.900
Does that say like bra, panties, those are two,

38:04.900 --> 38:06.980
garter, and then-

38:06.980 --> 38:08.260
I think it means different styles.

38:08.260 --> 38:09.300
So you got boy shorts.

38:09.300 --> 38:10.340
You got like bikini cut.

38:10.340 --> 38:12.900
Oh, I thought there was like a belly button sack.

38:13.540 --> 38:15.060
And like knee covers.

38:15.060 --> 38:17.380
Like knee covers for your knees.

38:17.380 --> 38:18.580
That was the complex part.

38:18.580 --> 38:20.340
They understood bra and underwear,

38:20.340 --> 38:21.860
but then they were like, what about knees?

38:21.860 --> 38:23.620
That can be very sexy.

38:23.620 --> 38:24.100
Oh yeah?

38:24.740 --> 38:27.060
Because you can add a little bit of mystique

38:27.060 --> 38:28.020
to your knee-ples.

38:29.620 --> 38:31.860

38:45.460 --> 38:46.740
I really am wearing them now.

38:46.740 --> 38:49.780
Yeah, I wear them like when I'm out of MeUndies,

38:49.780 --> 38:50.740
it's time for laundry.

38:51.380 --> 38:53.380
They are the limitless pill of clothes.

38:53.380 --> 38:55.460
I have a call to action here.

38:55.460 --> 39:00.740
I want the Bim Bam Nation to listen up because-

39:00.740 --> 39:02.580
Is that a douche nation reference?

39:02.580 --> 39:04.660
It was just sort of a radio, generic radio.

39:04.660 --> 39:06.020
But yeah, it can be that if you want.

39:06.820 --> 39:09.460
Sean Sleeps Naked has a new album out

39:09.460 --> 39:10.740
and it's called Voided.

39:11.300 --> 39:13.140
And I'm gonna tell you a little bit about it,

39:13.140 --> 39:14.260
but I want you to go look it up.

39:14.260 --> 39:15.860
I want you to go listen to these tunes.

39:15.860 --> 39:18.180
It's a Louisville-based indie band.

39:18.180 --> 39:20.500
Again, the name, Sean Sleeps Naked.

39:20.500 --> 39:21.380
It's their second album.

39:21.380 --> 39:22.260
It's titled Voided.

39:22.260 --> 39:23.620
That's Sean, let's be clear.

39:23.620 --> 39:25.700
S-H-A-W-N.

39:25.700 --> 39:27.940
Yeah, there's no S-H-A-U-N.

39:27.940 --> 39:29.380
None of that bullshit.

39:29.380 --> 39:30.820
What about S-H-O-N?

39:30.820 --> 39:32.740
S-H-O-N?

39:32.740 --> 39:33.460
S-H-O-N.

39:33.460 --> 39:34.740
It's short for Shonies.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.900
Hi, I'm Shoney Bear.

39:36.900 --> 39:37.300
This is my new album.

39:37.300 --> 39:38.500
So tell us more about this album.

39:38.500 --> 39:38.980
Talk about it.

39:38.980 --> 39:40.340
Oh, I'd rather talk about Shoney Bear.

39:40.340 --> 39:42.020
You got me on a Shoney Bear tilt.

39:43.300 --> 39:44.900
It's a second album from Sean Sleeps Naked.

We also have a message for Robin with a Y.

40:10.500 --> 40:11.300
Why?

40:11.300 --> 40:11.940
Because I...

40:12.820 --> 40:14.980
Robin from The Mask?

40:14.980 --> 40:16.260
Yeah, nailed it.

40:16.260 --> 40:17.780
And it's from Kevin.

40:17.780 --> 40:18.820
Kevin says, congratulations.

40:18.820 --> 40:21.380
Kevin, like smoking from The Mask.

40:22.260 --> 40:24.180
Kevin says, congratulations to my lovely

40:24.180 --> 40:26.340
and talented girlfriend, Robin with a Y

40:26.340 --> 40:30.020
for graduating from the UBC with your nursing degree.

40:30.020 --> 40:31.620
Now get out there and make me proud

40:31.620 --> 40:33.060
by getting a goddamn job

40:33.700 --> 40:35.300
and make the brothers McElroy proud

40:35.300 --> 40:36.580
by getting that cash money.

40:37.460 --> 40:39.060
Let's get that hype train going

40:39.060 --> 40:43.300
by getting the brothers to give a big get hype

40:43.300 --> 40:43.940
on three.

40:44.580 --> 40:46.980
One, two, three, get hype.

40:46.980 --> 40:47.860
Get hype!

40:51.060 --> 40:51.940
This is Hoops.

40:51.940 --> 40:52.740
Hey, Beach Baby.

40:53.860 --> 40:55.060
How are you doing?

40:55.060 --> 40:55.540
Good.

40:55.540 --> 40:57.060
Tell me you're just having some fun in the sun.

40:57.780 --> 40:58.340
That's good to hear.

40:58.340 --> 40:59.620
We're recording the podcast right now.

40:59.620 --> 41:00.420
We're doing the money sound.

41:01.300 --> 41:02.340
Whoa, hold on.

41:02.340 --> 41:03.540
They got a dolphin.

41:03.540 --> 41:05.700
The dolphin I'm riding just went under.

41:05.700 --> 41:06.820
Okay, hold on, it's coming back up.

41:06.820 --> 41:08.580
Okay, now I'm back above.

41:08.580 --> 41:09.780
Is your phone waterproof?

41:09.780 --> 41:10.340
I'm worried about...

41:11.220 --> 41:11.860
They're expensive.

41:13.940 --> 41:14.980
Don't worry about my phone.

41:14.980 --> 41:16.020
It's waterproof.

41:16.020 --> 41:17.620
They give you a special waterproof beach phone.

41:17.620 --> 41:18.980
It's an iPhone 7.

41:18.980 --> 41:19.220
Okay.

41:19.220 --> 41:19.940
When you get to the beach.

41:21.540 --> 41:23.300
Will you, just apropos of nothing,

41:23.300 --> 41:25.540
will you yell get hype for me?

41:26.900 --> 41:28.900
Okay, like yell, yell?

41:28.900 --> 41:29.300
Yeah.

41:29.300 --> 41:29.940
I mean, you're in the middle of the ocean.

41:29.940 --> 41:31.460
I want everyone on the beach to hear it.

41:32.020 --> 41:32.660
Get hype!

41:33.540 --> 41:35.540
I feel like you could have really leaned into it a little bit more.

41:35.540 --> 41:36.100
Let's do a quick...

41:37.700 --> 41:38.740
My baby's asleep.

41:38.740 --> 41:39.300
Oh, I see, I see.

41:39.300 --> 41:40.260
I'm gonna yell, yell.

41:40.980 --> 41:41.700
Vacation checkup.

41:41.700 --> 41:42.500
How are things going?

41:44.580 --> 41:45.700
Well, they're going pretty good.

41:45.700 --> 41:46.420
Just getting that D.

41:47.460 --> 41:48.260
Carving the waves.

41:49.300 --> 41:49.940
On a dolphin?

41:49.940 --> 41:52.580
Yeah, the dolphin and I are shredding waves.

41:52.580 --> 41:57.060
Some other guy tried to snake our toasty, toasty surf.

41:57.060 --> 41:59.940
Some other guy on another dolphin that was bigger than mine

41:59.940 --> 42:01.700
tried to snake my wave.

42:01.700 --> 42:03.940
And I was like, not in this lifetime.

42:03.940 --> 42:06.420
And I took my glasses down like, oh yeah.

42:07.620 --> 42:09.140
Well, it was good checking in with you.

42:09.140 --> 42:10.900
How many boat drinks have you had today?

42:12.100 --> 42:13.620
How many boat drinks have I had today?

42:13.620 --> 42:15.300
I've just been inventing them wholesale.

42:15.300 --> 42:17.460
I came up with one that was just old coffee

42:17.460 --> 42:18.980
and I'm drawing on vodka.

42:18.980 --> 42:19.940
Drawing on vodka.

42:20.660 --> 42:21.940
That sounds just terrible.

42:22.820 --> 42:24.900
I call it the 34-year-old man.

42:24.900 --> 42:26.660
Well, good checking in, good talk.

42:26.660 --> 42:27.860
Have a good time out there.

42:27.860 --> 42:28.660
Stay safe.

42:28.660 --> 42:29.780
And I love you.

42:30.740 --> 42:31.700
I love you too.

42:31.700 --> 42:32.740
Have a great show.

42:32.740 --> 42:33.780
We already did.

42:33.780 --> 42:36.180
Now girlfriend, I've sent you an update on this message.

42:36.180 --> 42:37.220
Oh, shit.

42:37.220 --> 42:40.180
Okay, here's the squeakquel to that message.

42:40.180 --> 42:41.860
Kevin wanted to update this personal message

42:41.860 --> 42:43.140
since Robin has gotten a job now.

42:43.140 --> 42:44.020
Here's the updated message.

42:44.020 --> 42:46.100
Congratulations to my lovely and talented girlfriend,

42:46.100 --> 42:48.820
Robin with a Y for graduating from UBC and getting a job.

42:48.820 --> 42:49.780
All ready.

42:49.780 --> 42:51.380
Now that you'll be making the brothers proud

42:51.380 --> 42:52.660
by getting that cash money,

42:52.660 --> 42:54.340
and then there's $3 signs here,

42:54.340 --> 42:56.420
I'd like to take this opportunity to quit my job

42:56.420 --> 42:58.180
and become a stay-at-home boyfriend.

42:58.180 --> 43:00.260
Also, can you make sure that Griffin reads this?

43:00.260 --> 43:01.220
He's our favorite.

43:01.220 --> 43:02.740
See, I wish we had read this one before

43:02.740 --> 43:05.460
because then we wouldn't had to upset Justin

43:05.460 --> 43:06.660
by calling him during beach day.

43:06.660 --> 43:09.460
Yeah, but now people get to know that we're not lying.

43:09.460 --> 43:11.700
Justin's not actually just sitting at home going,

43:11.700 --> 43:13.540
I don't wanna record.

43:13.540 --> 43:16.580
No, he's humping that surf on a dolphin.

43:16.580 --> 43:17.700
Humping that surf.

43:17.700 --> 43:19.300
Humping that surf, getting that phone.

43:20.500 --> 43:21.540
Let's get back to the episode.

43:21.540 --> 43:22.340
Let's get back to the episode.

43:22.340 --> 43:23.060
Thank you all for listening.

43:23.060 --> 43:25.060
We'll be back to a regular episode next week.

43:25.060 --> 43:26.180
I promise, I hope.

43:27.300 --> 43:30.980
In my head, I have a tiny bookkeeper with a green visor

43:30.980 --> 43:33.140
and one of those receipt machines

43:33.140 --> 43:36.020
that just like the receipts fly into the air comically.

43:36.820 --> 43:40.420
And I have a running tally of exactly how much money

43:40.420 --> 43:41.860
everybody owes me all the time.

43:41.860 --> 43:43.380
And I'm not miserly about it.

43:43.380 --> 43:44.980
I'm not gonna go after those people,

43:44.980 --> 43:49.460
but Travis, you owe me $364.

43:49.460 --> 43:50.500
I believe that.

43:50.500 --> 43:53.460
Justin, you and I are totally even.

43:53.460 --> 43:54.020
Nice.

43:54.020 --> 43:54.820
Which is nice.

43:54.820 --> 43:56.020
Yeah, which is nice.

43:56.020 --> 44:01.300
But I mean, all of my friends, like Stu, Stu owes me 455.

44:01.300 --> 44:03.540
And like I'm never gonna forget about that.

44:03.540 --> 44:04.340
Ever.

44:04.340 --> 44:05.700
Ever, Stu.

44:05.700 --> 44:06.740
That's classic Stu though.

44:07.300 --> 44:09.300
Yeah, God forbid something happens to Stu

44:09.300 --> 44:10.500
and you never see that money.

44:10.500 --> 44:13.780
Oh, I have already lost a lot of funds.

44:13.780 --> 44:15.860
I have unrecoverable funds.

44:15.860 --> 44:17.940
Gaddafi, I drew 20 spot.

44:17.940 --> 44:21.620
Gaddafi, that fool owe me $12, 12 whole dollars.

44:22.260 --> 44:23.140
He was like Griffin.

44:23.140 --> 44:25.460
He sent you a bottle of wine and you're like, no Gaddafi.

44:26.420 --> 44:27.780
Griffin, can I get a scarf?

44:27.780 --> 44:29.220
It's so chilly in Libya.

44:29.220 --> 44:30.980
Give me a $12 scarf.

44:30.980 --> 44:31.540
And you're like.

44:31.540 --> 44:33.780
Well, we were hitting up the bars on 36

44:33.780 --> 44:36.180
and he was like, oh man, I left my wallet at home.

44:36.180 --> 44:38.180
I was like, Gaddafi, I got you.

44:38.180 --> 44:39.060
And I did got him.

44:39.060 --> 44:40.100
And then you know what happened?

44:40.100 --> 44:41.540
He went and got himself killed.

44:41.540 --> 44:43.460
Thanks Gaddafi for nothing.

44:43.460 --> 44:44.100
Yeah.

44:44.100 --> 44:46.100
And all that full drink is buttery nipples.

44:46.660 --> 44:47.380
Yep.

44:47.380 --> 44:49.140
And so, you know, it's going to be a pricey night.

44:50.180 --> 44:53.060
We all think about Criss Angel in the context of Mind Freak.

44:53.060 --> 44:57.780
But what we rarely think about is that Criss Angel is a real person

44:57.780 --> 44:58.420
who has to go-

44:58.420 --> 44:59.940
Who like goes home and makes waffles.

44:59.940 --> 45:03.700
He goes to Whole Foods and he buys kale.

45:03.700 --> 45:06.820
Like this is something, this is a real person that does these things.

45:07.460 --> 45:07.960
Right.

45:08.660 --> 45:11.140
He's not just magicking all the time or maybe he is.

45:11.140 --> 45:13.140
Wouldn't you like to think that he is?

45:13.140 --> 45:14.820
Like even at home and no one's around,

45:14.820 --> 45:19.140
like all of a sudden the coffee's in the glass and he's like, sigh, Mind Freak.

45:19.140 --> 45:19.620
Yeah.

45:19.620 --> 45:27.140
My problem with Mind Freak is that it's unfairly watchable

45:27.140 --> 45:30.420
because it's constantly taunting you with the possibility

45:30.420 --> 45:32.820
that you'll see Criss Angel killed before your eyes.

45:33.700 --> 45:36.420
It's like an irresistible ratings bait.

45:36.420 --> 45:36.660
Yeah.

45:36.660 --> 45:37.700
I think and it's not fair.

45:37.700 --> 45:40.100
And I think they do have to deliver on it eventually.

45:40.100 --> 45:42.500
Yeah. At least an amputation.

45:42.500 --> 45:47.700
Like today I'm going to set myself ablaze while a man shoots a revolver at me.

45:47.700 --> 45:49.780
Like, oh man, clear the Tivo.

45:49.780 --> 45:51.380
Today I'm going to drink lava.

45:51.380 --> 45:51.940
Hey Criss.

45:53.140 --> 45:54.820
Criss, Criss, I wouldn't advise that.

45:55.940 --> 45:57.220
Maybe you should cancel this one.

45:59.140 --> 46:02.180
He, I'm looking at pictures of him right now

46:02.180 --> 46:06.340
and I cannot fucking handle his whole style.

46:06.340 --> 46:07.700
His whole, yeah.

46:07.700 --> 46:09.460
There's a thing on, there's a thing on, okay.

46:09.460 --> 46:13.140
If you go to A&E TV right now, there is an ad for the show

46:13.140 --> 46:15.300
and the tagline of this, like, I think it's a,

46:15.300 --> 46:17.460
maybe a trivia question or an interactive game.

46:18.260 --> 46:21.620
And it, the question is, will you save or kill Criss Angel?

46:21.620 --> 46:23.860
The game is called Kill Criss Angel.

46:23.860 --> 46:24.180
Okay.

46:24.180 --> 46:26.500
Like they know what they're doing with this

46:26.500 --> 46:29.620
and they they're playing off our desire to see him die.

46:29.620 --> 46:33.060
Hey world, if you see Criss Angel, give him a hug.

46:33.060 --> 46:36.580
Just tell him like it's okay and it's going to be all right.

46:36.580 --> 46:39.220
And maybe, you know, he just wants to hang out.

46:39.220 --> 46:40.820
Maybe just buy Criss Angel a beer.

46:40.820 --> 46:42.820
We could save Criss Angel's life today.

46:43.540 --> 46:46.100
I would, I would like to try to reach out to Criss Angel

46:46.100 --> 46:49.300
and say, it's not that there are many people

46:49.300 --> 46:51.060
I'd like to watch die on TV,

46:51.940 --> 46:55.300
but you are the only one that keeps taunting me

46:55.300 --> 46:56.340
with the possibility.

46:56.340 --> 46:58.420
And that's the only reason I'm so hungry for your death.

46:58.420 --> 47:00.340
Like the first season of that show started out

47:00.340 --> 47:01.380
as real magic, right?

47:01.380 --> 47:03.460
And now it's just like fucking bear baiting.

47:03.460 --> 47:06.420
Like it's, it's waiting to watch Criss Angel die.

47:06.420 --> 47:08.820
Did you see the bear baiting episode?

47:08.820 --> 47:11.140
I thought that it was going to gobble him up for sure.

47:12.100 --> 47:14.340
All I hope is that Criss Angel,

47:15.220 --> 47:17.620
when he like does do something like drink lava,

47:18.260 --> 47:21.940
I just hope that his last words are like,

47:21.940 --> 47:22.660
mind free.

47:25.220 --> 47:28.260
And now the mind that is freaked is my own.

47:30.900 --> 47:33.540
You and Paul Giamatti live in your own

47:33.540 --> 47:35.380
like parallel universe together.

47:35.380 --> 47:37.380
And if you want to make amends with him,

47:37.380 --> 47:38.420
you go to his house.

47:38.420 --> 47:40.420
I'm tired of using our show as a platform

47:40.420 --> 47:41.940
to apologize to Paul Giamatti.

47:44.020 --> 47:44.740
You know what Griffin,

47:44.740 --> 47:46.020
buy a fucking personal ad

47:46.020 --> 47:48.260
and say you're sorry to Paul from now on.

47:48.260 --> 47:52.100
Cause I'm tired of using NBNBA as a bully pulpit

47:52.100 --> 47:55.060
to apologize for bullying Paul Giamatti.

47:55.060 --> 47:55.780
It's done.

47:55.780 --> 47:56.100
It's over.

47:56.100 --> 47:58.340
Hey guys, can we cut out cyber bullying

47:58.340 --> 47:59.620
of Paul Giamatti please?

47:59.620 --> 48:00.500
Can I just say one thing though?

48:01.060 --> 48:02.820
Yeah, as long as it's not directly,

48:02.820 --> 48:04.580
direct address to Paul Giamatti.

48:04.580 --> 48:13.060
Paul Giamatti, I would like to issue a statement

48:13.060 --> 48:14.820
to all Paul Giamatti.

48:16.900 --> 48:17.700
I'm so sorry.

48:18.900 --> 48:20.020
I'm so sorry.

48:20.020 --> 48:22.580
Paul Giamatti in Idaho right now.

48:22.580 --> 48:23.460
That's like crying.

48:24.260 --> 48:25.700
Messers Giamatti.

48:25.700 --> 48:27.300
I apologize for my actions.

48:29.460 --> 48:31.380
What if everything was shaped like a penis?

48:31.380 --> 48:34.100
What if everything in the world was shaped like a penis?

48:34.100 --> 48:38.020
Buildings, buses, cars, shoes, fridges, et cetera.

48:38.020 --> 48:39.060
Would women like that?

48:43.060 --> 48:44.660
I have news for this guy.

48:44.660 --> 48:46.500
Maybe you haven't looked at a skyline recently.

48:46.500 --> 48:49.060
Everything is shaped like a penis.

48:49.060 --> 48:50.900
It's a man's world.

48:51.940 --> 48:53.860
Penis has a tiny radio antenna

48:53.860 --> 48:54.900
coming out of the top of it.

48:54.900 --> 48:56.500
So that's, yes.

48:56.500 --> 48:57.000
Right.

48:57.860 --> 48:59.940
I would like to ask you a question.

48:59.940 --> 49:01.380
I would like to-

49:01.380 --> 49:02.820
To pick up all the vibes the ladies-

49:02.820 --> 49:04.500
I would like to hear this guy's question

49:05.060 --> 49:08.660
as if he and his friends often use the phrase,

49:10.180 --> 49:11.780
everything's shaped like a penis.

49:11.780 --> 49:13.140
And then he's like, what if everything was-

49:13.140 --> 49:14.740
What if literally everything?

49:14.740 --> 49:16.580
What if I was reading this question

49:16.580 --> 49:18.020
off a penis-shaped computer?

49:18.020 --> 49:22.740
That's just not the best viewing experience, I feel like.

49:22.740 --> 49:24.820
Also, how would you give directions to anybody?

49:26.020 --> 49:28.580
Just turn left at the penis thing.

49:28.580 --> 49:30.180
I'll meet you by the cock.

49:30.180 --> 49:31.860
Like, I don't know.

49:31.860 --> 49:34.340
I don't know which one, because everything.

49:34.340 --> 49:34.900
You're shaped like a penis.

49:34.900 --> 49:36.180
No, no, the veiny one.

49:36.180 --> 49:36.680
Yeah.

49:37.620 --> 49:40.820
I think my favorite misconception about this

49:40.820 --> 49:42.660
is that women are walking around every day

49:42.660 --> 49:44.660
wishing everything was shaped like a penis.

49:45.380 --> 49:48.660
Man, I sure wish I could see some penis-shaped things today.

49:48.660 --> 49:49.160
Right.

49:49.700 --> 49:52.260
If only this cell phone was shaped like a penis.

49:52.980 --> 49:55.620
But this man wasn't thinking laterally.

49:55.620 --> 49:58.580
Laterally? He wasn't thinking about-

49:58.580 --> 50:00.580
He wasn't thinking across all the different possibilities.

50:00.580 --> 50:02.100
You've got to think about the big picture.

50:02.100 --> 50:03.780
We're talking about literature.

50:04.340 --> 50:06.420
We're talking about trying to read a book,

50:06.420 --> 50:08.100
but the pages are in the shapes of dicks.

50:08.820 --> 50:12.420
So you get like two words, three words, three words, three words,

50:12.420 --> 50:13.700
and then like 10 words.

50:13.700 --> 50:14.900
This is the balls.

50:14.900 --> 50:17.460
What if this was like a fucking Twilight Zone episode

50:17.460 --> 50:19.540
and even the words were shaped like dicks?

50:19.540 --> 50:20.740
Travis, this is every-

50:20.740 --> 50:21.460
Everything!

50:21.460 --> 50:23.220
We would have to invent a new language

50:23.220 --> 50:25.220
where every character was a dick.

50:25.220 --> 50:27.140
So you're saying like the book too

50:27.140 --> 50:29.380
would be shaped like a penis, you mean?

50:29.380 --> 50:30.260
That's what I'm saying.

50:30.260 --> 50:33.060
It would be like eat, pray, love,

50:33.060 --> 50:34.740
hide it when the kids come in the room.

50:34.740 --> 50:36.580
So basically what it is is

50:36.580 --> 50:38.340
this is a guy who has spent his life,

50:38.340 --> 50:39.860
I don't know, killing dicks or something

50:39.860 --> 50:41.460
or just like making fun of dicks

50:41.460 --> 50:43.620
and then he wakes up one day and he's shaped like a dick

50:43.620 --> 50:44.820
and everything's shaped like a dick

50:44.820 --> 50:45.860
and the books are shaped like dicks

50:45.860 --> 50:47.140
and the words are shaped like dicks

50:47.140 --> 50:48.820
and like his breakfast is shaped like dicks

50:48.820 --> 50:50.180
and he's just in the middle of town square

50:50.740 --> 50:54.180
spinning around the dick-shaped town square screaming dicks!

50:54.180 --> 50:56.100
And then a dick-shaped ghost comes up and is like,

50:56.100 --> 50:57.940
shouldn't have killed all those dicks.

50:57.940 --> 50:58.440
What?

50:59.140 --> 51:00.500
What are you talking about?

51:01.060 --> 51:01.860
Killing dicks?

51:03.540 --> 51:07.060
And then it pulls out two vagina-shaped scientists

51:07.060 --> 51:08.100
saying shut it down.

51:08.100 --> 51:08.340
Yeah.

51:11.140 --> 51:16.420
I think that this man's main point is fallacious

51:16.420 --> 51:19.220
and that is that women would like it

51:19.220 --> 51:20.980
because I think that after a while

51:20.980 --> 51:24.900
it wouldn't be like, if every letter in the alphabet

51:24.900 --> 51:25.620
looked like a dick,

51:26.260 --> 51:29.940
then when I got a special woman in the bedroom

51:29.940 --> 51:31.380
and showed her my treasure,

51:31.380 --> 51:34.260
she'd be like, yep, like so.

51:34.260 --> 51:36.820
What if everything was dick-shaped except dicks?

51:36.820 --> 51:37.380
Yeah.

51:37.380 --> 51:41.220
And your dick was shaped like a sitar maybe or another.

51:41.220 --> 51:43.220
Sitars kinda look like dicks a little bit.

51:43.220 --> 51:44.820
What if it was like you could choose it

51:44.820 --> 51:46.900
like, you know, maybe you want it to look like,

51:46.900 --> 51:47.940
you know, a clownfish.

51:47.940 --> 51:48.740
I don't know, it's up to you.

51:49.300 --> 51:49.780
Yeah.

51:49.780 --> 51:50.420
Maybe not.

51:50.420 --> 51:52.100
Wait, are they not supposed to look like clownfish?

51:53.780 --> 51:55.700
I have to go to the doctors.

51:55.700 --> 51:56.740
All the doctors now.

51:56.740 --> 52:00.820
Dr. Maia, my treasure looks like Nemo.

52:03.700 --> 52:05.540
I was thinking if I ever get the death sentence,

52:05.540 --> 52:06.660
what would be my last meal?

52:06.660 --> 52:08.260
I'm wondering what other people would have.

52:08.260 --> 52:09.380
I was thinking a double,

52:10.180 --> 52:12.340
an extra large double bacon cheeseburger meal

52:12.340 --> 52:13.700
supersized from Burger King.

52:13.700 --> 52:15.140
But what to have for dessert?

52:16.340 --> 52:18.580
That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.

52:18.580 --> 52:19.380
Why are you sad?

52:19.380 --> 52:21.460
You know what, the irony is that if you have

52:21.460 --> 52:25.220
a double bacon supersized chunder meal from Burger King,

52:25.220 --> 52:26.420
that will be your last meal.

52:26.420 --> 52:28.340
You're as good as that anyway.

52:28.340 --> 52:30.740
A chunder blender from Burger King.

52:32.660 --> 52:35.860
I prefer to go to Outback and get the chunder from Down Under.

52:37.060 --> 52:38.100
What did you get at Burger King?

52:38.100 --> 52:38.660
A mistake.

52:40.260 --> 52:41.220
But that's okay.

52:41.220 --> 52:43.540
You get one last meal and you can pick from anything.

52:43.540 --> 52:45.300
And right after that, you're gonna be killed.

52:45.300 --> 52:46.180
What do you want?

52:46.180 --> 52:47.140
Some Burger King.

52:47.140 --> 52:47.620
Yeah.

52:47.620 --> 52:49.540
Can you get me some Burger King?

52:49.540 --> 52:52.980
Can you tip down to BK and get me some twists?

52:53.620 --> 52:56.740
The only thing I can think is that that is a play.

52:56.740 --> 52:59.860
You're making a play so that the governor feels so bad for you

52:59.860 --> 53:01.300
that he decides not to kill you

53:01.300 --> 53:02.900
because you're already dead inside.

53:02.900 --> 53:05.460
Can I get some of those crown-shaped chicken tenders?

53:08.100 --> 53:09.940
And the crown so everybody knows I'm,

53:09.940 --> 53:11.620
and so I can sit on my electric throne.

53:14.100 --> 53:15.540
I wanna be the king of dead.

53:15.540 --> 53:18.420
I'm the king of dead town.

53:18.420 --> 53:21.460
I used to be the king of murder and now I will be the king of heaven.

53:22.900 --> 53:26.580
Oh my god, wheels and the rest of the BK Kids Club is here.

53:26.580 --> 53:29.460
They're all here welcoming me in.

53:29.460 --> 53:30.900
Welcome me in.

53:30.900 --> 53:32.420
Fly me to heaven, big kid.

53:35.700 --> 53:40.180
You die looking at the picture of the BK Kids Club like Susan Sarandon.

53:40.180 --> 53:42.580
The last face you see is gonna be a face of love.

53:43.780 --> 53:44.580
I'm sorry.

53:44.580 --> 53:47.220
OMG, my tropical fish are eating it?

53:48.580 --> 53:49.080
What?

53:50.500 --> 53:53.060
Um, I'm so sorry.

53:53.060 --> 53:56.100
Someone jizzed into my aquarium and now my fish are feeding on it.

54:02.100 --> 54:03.140
Don't let me finish.

54:03.140 --> 54:05.700
Will they get pregnant and what type of fish can I expect?

54:06.820 --> 54:08.740
Will they hatch out like tiny mermaid things?

54:08.740 --> 54:15.780
What, what kind of mystery is this?

54:15.780 --> 54:17.860
Let's, yeah, let's sleuth this one out.

54:17.860 --> 54:20.820
There's so many layers.

54:20.820 --> 54:23.300
You know what not to get a girl for her birthday party?

54:23.300 --> 54:23.780
Yeah, no.

54:23.780 --> 54:25.380
Jizzing in her aquarium.

54:25.380 --> 54:26.420
Hey, look what I did.

54:27.220 --> 54:28.180
Happy birthday.

54:28.180 --> 54:29.380
Happy B-day, Cynthia.

54:30.740 --> 54:32.500
That beta has human feet.

54:34.820 --> 54:35.700
Who jizzed in this?

54:35.700 --> 54:38.900
Yes, my beta has a human face like Seaman.

54:38.900 --> 54:39.300
I am upset.

54:39.300 --> 54:43.940
I want to make an open appeal to the gentleman who committed this heinous crime.

54:43.940 --> 54:45.540
Why was that your best option?

54:46.180 --> 54:51.220
And what was the timeline like where someone jizzed in this aquarium, skedaddled,

54:51.220 --> 54:55.220
and she entered the room fast enough to see the fish eating the juice?

54:57.380 --> 54:59.780
Fish will eat anything you put into an aquarium instantly.

54:59.780 --> 55:02.580
So it had to be like, whoop, done, out.

55:02.580 --> 55:04.500
Hey, they're eating it.

55:04.500 --> 55:07.700
Yahoo.

55:07.700 --> 55:10.740
I passed a mysterious stranger coming out of my room.

55:11.700 --> 55:15.620
People say that the American Pie movies aren't having a detriment on our society,

55:15.620 --> 55:18.980
but look, teenagers out there are reenacting these scenes.

55:20.260 --> 55:21.300
Did you guys see that one?

55:21.300 --> 55:22.100
I think it was Banking 3.

55:22.100 --> 55:26.020
Oh, the one where Stiffler ejaculates?

55:26.020 --> 55:28.340
No, it's actually, I popular mis-

55:28.340 --> 55:31.140
It's actually Stiffler's cousin at that point.

55:31.140 --> 55:37.540
So Stiffler's cousin gives his seed, the gift of his seed, to an aquarium.

55:37.540 --> 55:37.780
Yeah.

55:37.780 --> 55:41.780
And then fish eat it, and then it creates horrible sea monsters.

55:41.780 --> 55:46.980
I am so upset, like physically angry at all of this.

55:46.980 --> 55:47.380
Yeah, there's nothing good about this.

55:47.380 --> 55:50.660
Because you're thinking about a fish, thinking about fish with human arms.

55:50.660 --> 55:51.860
No, you know what, Griffin?

55:51.860 --> 55:53.700
And you're thinking about how you'll never be able to hang out with it.

55:53.700 --> 56:02.020
I'm eight steps back, thinking about the prior situation before this girl walked into the room.

56:02.020 --> 56:05.620
Was this gentleman standing there, and he pulled out a chair and stood on top of it?

56:05.620 --> 56:06.340
No, no, no.

56:06.340 --> 56:08.260
I'm sure this thing's been loaded to the ground.

56:08.260 --> 56:14.500
The problem is that maybe, you're just assuming that this person started out

56:14.500 --> 56:19.460
with the intention of, oh, I'm gonna jerk it in this here fish tank.

56:20.820 --> 56:22.820
I think that it was an emergency.

56:22.820 --> 56:24.580
I think he was short on time.

56:24.580 --> 56:24.820
Right.

56:24.820 --> 56:28.100
I think he said, I need to do this somewhere.

56:28.100 --> 56:28.740
Gotta be somewhere.

56:29.380 --> 56:31.460
So you're saying he just didn't have an exit strategy when he started?

56:31.460 --> 56:32.660
Didn't have a plan.

56:32.660 --> 56:36.500
His plan was jerk it, and then that was it.

56:36.500 --> 56:37.460
That's the end of the plan.

56:37.460 --> 56:42.340
It's honestly her fault for hanging that poster of Carla Gugino behind her aquarium,

56:42.340 --> 56:43.060
if you think about it.

56:43.060 --> 56:45.140
Well, were you thinking with that Gugino poster?

56:45.140 --> 56:46.020
How could you?

56:46.020 --> 56:51.060
You can't just put a Gugino up in your room and put a Carla Gugino poster anywhere.

56:51.060 --> 56:53.700
And you put it so close to the aquarium.

56:53.700 --> 56:56.020
You were almost begging for human fish monsters.

56:56.020 --> 56:57.140
Ew, you nasty.

56:57.700 --> 57:01.620
Maybe you need to be more selective of the people and you invite into your house.

57:01.620 --> 57:05.700
If you had a party and you don't know which one of them came in your aquarium.

57:05.700 --> 57:07.380
You know, you have to know.

57:08.900 --> 57:15.300
Line up the usual suspects to who Gugino'd write into my aquarium.

57:15.300 --> 57:19.860
Take a chance.

57:19.860 --> 57:26.660
This Yahoo was sent in by Lisa Holifield.

57:26.660 --> 57:27.380
Thank you, Lisa.

57:27.380 --> 57:32.500
It's by Yahoo Answers user Matt L who asks, cool band names for metal band?

57:34.020 --> 57:39.460
My band has been wanting to do a show for some time now, but we have one small problem.

57:39.460 --> 57:41.140
We can't think of a good band name.

57:41.140 --> 57:45.140
We are a metal death metal band and our songs are original.

57:45.140 --> 57:45.620
Please help.

57:47.220 --> 57:48.260
Mercury.

57:48.260 --> 57:49.940
Travis says Mercury.

57:49.940 --> 57:53.540
Justin, do you have any other Greek gods slash planets that you want to drop on?

57:53.540 --> 57:57.300
I was actually going for a metallic substance.

57:57.300 --> 57:59.060
You clever fuck.

57:59.060 --> 57:59.780
I know, right?

57:59.780 --> 58:00.580
God, that's good.

58:01.460 --> 58:02.340
It's really juicy.

58:02.340 --> 58:03.220
Aluminium.

58:03.220 --> 58:03.700
Yeah.

58:03.700 --> 58:06.740
It's a really, it's a really juicy vein of comedy.

58:06.740 --> 58:11.700
You struck a real nice vein.

58:12.580 --> 58:14.740
You know what helps any joke?

58:14.740 --> 58:19.220
If the person has to have a rudimentary understanding of the chemical table before they

58:20.420 --> 58:21.380
laugh at it.

58:21.380 --> 58:21.620
Yeah.

58:21.620 --> 58:21.860
Yeah.

58:21.860 --> 58:23.940
Which in this day and age, most people do.

58:23.940 --> 58:24.980
I would say breaking bad.

58:26.260 --> 58:28.020
Everybody knows most of the symbols now.

58:28.020 --> 58:28.420
Yeah.

58:28.420 --> 58:28.900
Bull run.

58:29.700 --> 58:31.620
It is not at all called the chemical table.

58:31.620 --> 58:33.060
What the fuck is it called?

58:33.060 --> 58:34.260
Periodical table of elements.

58:34.260 --> 58:34.740
There it is.

58:34.740 --> 58:36.820
You idiot child.

58:38.100 --> 58:40.660
Are you sure it's periodical and not periodic?

58:41.220 --> 58:42.180
It's periodical.

58:42.180 --> 58:44.340
Sometimes it's there, sometimes it's not.

58:44.340 --> 58:46.420
It's a periodical, it's about magazines.

58:46.420 --> 58:48.420
It's a magazine table of magazines.

58:49.540 --> 58:51.380
This is a show for stupids.

58:51.380 --> 58:52.740
Like we're, it's made by-

58:52.740 --> 58:53.860
For and by.

58:53.860 --> 58:55.380
For and by dumbos.

58:57.220 --> 59:01.620
Do you guys want to hear some of the responses that Yahoo has provided?

59:01.620 --> 59:02.260
Yeah, I do.

59:02.260 --> 59:06.740
Yes, I am, says Glass Rose.

59:08.500 --> 59:09.380
Guilty witnesses.

59:10.740 --> 59:11.860
Unfortunate residents.

59:12.420 --> 59:13.220
Holy sins.

59:13.220 --> 59:14.500
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

59:14.500 --> 59:15.780
Unfortunate residents.

59:16.420 --> 59:17.540
I love this apartment.

59:19.140 --> 59:21.380
The roofing is just terrible.

59:23.140 --> 59:24.820
There is blood everywhere.

59:24.820 --> 59:25.140
Yeah.

59:25.140 --> 59:26.180
How unfortunate.

59:26.180 --> 59:27.860
Unfortunate residents.

59:27.860 --> 59:28.340
It's great.

59:28.340 --> 59:30.180
Our neighbors are very noisy.

59:30.180 --> 59:31.780
This is too bad.

59:31.780 --> 59:33.060
Holy sins.

59:33.060 --> 59:33.860
Flesh deep.

59:34.660 --> 59:35.540
Saturnine.

59:35.540 --> 59:36.980
Well, flesh deep?

59:36.980 --> 59:40.340
He's just combining two things that don't mean the same thing.

59:40.340 --> 59:42.660
Also, flesh deep's not that deep, friend.

59:43.220 --> 59:45.300
No, but he's saying that like holy sin.

59:46.340 --> 59:47.380
Two things together.

59:47.380 --> 59:48.660
This is fire.

59:48.660 --> 59:49.540
This is great.

59:49.540 --> 59:50.420
Rainy sun.

59:51.140 --> 59:54.100
Two and a half blank bodies, knives, IDK.

59:55.140 --> 59:55.700
Wait, what?

59:55.700 --> 59:56.420
Two and a half men?

59:57.140 --> 59:58.020
Two and a half men, sure.

59:58.020 --> 59:58.500
Two and a half.

59:58.500 --> 01:00:07.140
I think he's saying you should make your death metal band a parody off two and a half men's name.

01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:10.660
Man, man, man, man, man, man, man.

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:12.580
Uh, like two and a half bodies?

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:15.380
Humanities experiment.

01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:16.020
That's okay.

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:19.860
It's Me Drew has some really good ones.

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:21.940
Oh god, I was hoping that was the name of the band.

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:23.140
Are you there, god?

01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:24.340
It's Me Drew.

01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:25.700
Hey, mom, it's Me Drew.

01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:26.420
Time to rock.

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:26.920
Rock.

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:35.300
Your best bet, I think, for this particular band is to pick a name that is almost the

01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:39.140
name of another metal band so that people will get confused and come see your show.

01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:40.420
Scuttle of mud.

01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:40.660
Yeah.

01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:43.780
Scuttle of mud.

01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:45.300
Did you go see Metallica's?

01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:49.060
It's the plural.

01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:49.780
Metallico.

01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:53.940
I went and saw Spain this weekend.

01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:54.660
They were awesome.

01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:57.860
I want to go see 411.

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:02.020
They're definitely right.

01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:02.820
That is Justin.

01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:03.860
That is not even a...

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:08.900
That is so far from a metal band.

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:11.060
Amber is the color of your blood.

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:16.260
This one was sent in by Michael Cornely.

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:17.060
Thank you, Michael.

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:22.660
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jamie, who asks, my boyfriend is addicted to Skyrim?

01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:26.260
Okay, so yesterday, my BF got Skyrim, a random game.

01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:29.300
First off, Jamie, no.

01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:33.060
It's a fantasy epic from Bethesda.

01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:34.100
Learn something.

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:35.940
And ever since, he's been playing it so much.

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:38.740
Usually, if he gets a game, he would just play it for one or two hours and get bored

01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:41.700
of it, but he's been playing this thing for at least nine hours straight now.

01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:44.340
The only things he would get up from the computer is to go to the bathroom.

01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:47.780
He wouldn't even bother to get food, and I was scared that he would starve, so I ordered

01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:51.380
him some pizza, and then he just ate it by the computer while playing.

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:53.060
When I went to bed, he was still playing.

01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:54.900
When I woke up this morning, he was still playing.

01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:59.300
Usually, he likes sex at least twice a day, but he won't leave the computer even to have

01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:03.380
sex, so since I'm always thinking of him, I gave him a BJ, and the whole time, he was

01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:04.420
still on the computer.

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:05.220
I'm so worried.

01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:07.140
Your boyfriend has the best life.

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:08.340
I'm so worried about him.

01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:09.380
What should I do?

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:15.140
He played this video game so hard that you delivered him pizza and blowjobs.

01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:16.820
What are you talking about?

01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:19.060
You can never retrieve this relationship.

01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:20.100
It's over.

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:24.900
And while getting a blowjob, he was just chanting, Dovahki Dovahkin.

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:26.660
What are you doing?

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:29.060
What are you doing, lady?

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:33.140
Have you not been in a relationship before?

01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:34.500
That's not how you get anything.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:37.220
Here, I got you this pizza.

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:38.020
Please be okay.

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:40.180
I'm so worried about you.

01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:41.460
Please, I got you these blowjobs.

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:42.260
You just have to live.

01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:42.980
Take a chance.

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:46.660
Could I eat an entire bag of pizza rolls without dying?

01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:50.020
My friend says I'll die or something if I eat an entire bag of pizza rolls.

01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:51.220
90 count.

01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:53.140
But I know that it's complete poppycock.

01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:55.620
I'm a 15-year-old girl who's 125 pounds.

01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:56.420
Will I die?

01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:56.900
Doubt it.

01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:57.700
Get sick?

01:02:57.700 --> 01:02:58.260
Probably.

01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:05.220
I have a bigger problem than a 15-year-old girl using the word poppycock.

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:06.340
Yeah, what are you doing?

01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:08.900
So let me do a little quick math here.

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:09.380
OK.

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:12.740
90 pizza roll.

01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:14.980
It totally matters if it's Totino's.

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:17.140
Everyone knows that those roll a little bit smaller.

01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:18.260
Are they super stuffed?

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:18.760
Yeah.

01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:20.900
Are they straight cheesy?

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:21.700
Are they pepperoni?

01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:28.180
Because I don't know that your liver will be able to process all of the fat, the unsaturated,

01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:28.820
saturated fat.

01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:30.020
What if they're triple meat?

01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:31.060
What if it's double meat?

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:34.660
Well, triple would be more.

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:37.460
The third one's more sausage.

01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:40.420
If you're looking at pepperoni, which I think is the only sort of...

01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:40.920
Yeah.

01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:43.220
I mean, that's the only reasonable thing.

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:46.740
In a 15-count bag, you're doing...

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:47.240
No, 90.

01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:48.500
No, no, no.

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:49.620
I'm doing a little math here.

01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:50.120
Oh, OK.

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:57.140
In a 15-count bag, you're looking at 7.5 ounces.

01:03:57.140 --> 01:03:57.640
OK.

01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:58.140
Mm-hmm.

01:03:58.140 --> 01:03:59.380
Well, that's not that many ounces.

01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:01.780
No, that doesn't seem that bad, right?

01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:02.900
Then multiply that by 8.

01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:04.600
6.

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:05.100
6.

01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:06.900
Yeah, 7.5 times 6.

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:08.900
Times 4?

01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:11.940
Times 6 equals 45.

01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:14.020
Times 6 equals 45 ounces.

01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:15.160
That's about...

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:16.500
Divide that by 16.

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:17.060
It's about 12 pounds.

01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:18.020
So you're eating...

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:18.820
We're talking...

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:22.820
OK, well, we're talking about three pounds of pizza rolls, basically.

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:27.860
Man, that's going to be a rough night, huh?

01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:33.460
What kind of day did you have that you need to drown it in pizza rolls?

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:37.460
Pizza in the morning, pizza after school time, pizza never a goddamn again,

01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:41.060
because that one time I ate 90 pizza rolls.

01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:42.420
What I like is if...

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:44.420
Griffin, could you read me the last sentence again?

01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:45.940
Will I die?

01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:46.500
Doubt it.

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:47.300
Get sick?

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:47.800
Probably.

01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:53.060
So she knows that it is a bad idea, that she will at least get sick.

01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:53.700
Well, if...

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:58.180
Sorry, if you were asking yourself the question,

01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:01.700
will this thing kill me, and your answer is doubt it,

01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:05.140
that means there's a shadow of a doubt in your mind that yes, in fact,

01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:07.380
eating nine pounds of pizza...

01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:09.060
You know what, though, Griffin?

01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:12.900
I would say that man could have safely stayed on the surface of the earth

01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:14.660
and just stared at the moon for the rest of his life,

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:17.780
but he was willing to risk it to find out what would happen.

01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:21.460
Yeah, Travis is saying this because Travis's daily diet

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:24.820
is rated by how much the likelihood that it will kill him.

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:25.780
I'm saying...

01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:26.900
Bacon and applesauce?

01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:28.100
Maybe.

01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:30.100
Three pounds of pizza rolls.

01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:33.700
It's going to be gluttony from seven.

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:36.660
You're going to die fat on a table, and Brad Pitt's going to be like,

01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:42.020
oh, gross, I'm so thin and he's so fat.

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:44.820
High school.

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:47.300
Three pounds of pizza rolls.

01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:50.100
Imagine when you do have to go to the hospital,

01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:53.220
the doctor's like, we have a patient here, she's got an overdose of flavor.

01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:53.460
Yeah.

01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:55.620
Got flavor, she's got terminal flavor.

01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:56.820
She's been flavor blasted.

01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:58.420
She's got that Italian zest.

01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:00.900
Oh, I hit her right in all the right places.

01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:05.300
I tell you what's definitely going to happen is your mom is going to get pissed.

01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:07.300
Yeah, because you ate all the fucking pizza rolls.

01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:10.260
We were saving that from pizza roll night.

01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:13.220
She just got that at Sam's Club.

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:18.100
She's got to go all the way back out to the goddamn Sam's.

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:20.260
Why the fuck did I even get the Sam's Club membership?

01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:23.620
I could have just bought you four bags of pizza rolls at the Walmart.

01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:25.620
Nurse, get me the disaster.

01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:27.940
This woman ate the Super Bowl.

01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:32.180
What are the risks of at-home circumcision?

01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:34.820
My girlfriend gets freaked out by my aunt, Peter Wiener.

01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:37.620
I am going to police her and get a circumcision, but I don't have health insurance.

01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:39.860
I will do it tomorrow after school, but I want to know what the risks are.

01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:45.620
He says I will be using alcohol and scissors, but that is so dumb that I can't believe it's true.

01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:50.740
Did he say it's so dumb or did you say it's so dumb?

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:53.060
That was my own editorializing, I apologize.

01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:57.140
Ed note, Ed note, this guy's fucking out of his mind dumb.

01:06:57.140 --> 01:07:00.500
Oh God, I guess the biggest risk is that he doesn't die from it.

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:01.060
Yeah.

01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:02.020
What are the risks?

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:04.260
All of them, all of the risks.

01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:07.700
This is nothing but risks.

01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:09.380
Like the whole thing is a risk.

01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:10.740
It's all risk, no reward.

01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:12.020
What are you doing?

01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:12.820
Don't double down.

01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:14.580
It was okay.

01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:17.860
I took a huge risk so that I could have a mangled penis.

01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:20.980
Yeah, I mean, and here you go, sweetie.

01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:22.900
I got, I care about you so much.

01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:29.300
Every night I'm treating you to a poorly crafted turtleneck sweater, like fraying at the edges.

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:32.980
Well, here's my poorly sculpted member.

01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:40.020
The reward is if he does it right, you have a clean and healthy penis tip.

01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:41.940
No toboggan required.

01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:45.220
Yeah, and that's a great look.

01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:47.620
It's a great, yeah, you can just.

01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:51.380
It makes the, it makes the, it makes the, it makes the, it makes the, it makes the,

01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:55.860
it makes the tip of your penis look like Joe Pesci's head.

01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:56.580
Now I'm alone.

01:07:56.580 --> 01:07:57.700
Yeah, it's just really nice.

01:07:58.340 --> 01:07:59.460
Oh my God.

01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:01.940
After he gets his head burned by the, oh man.

01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:02.580
Yeah, I know.

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:05.620
Fuck, I can think of, oh God, I can think of exactly what you're talking about.

01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:06.020
Now I can't.

01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:07.780
Time for you to meet the wet bandit.

01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:11.300
Oh, it's sticky, is it sticky bandit?

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:14.500
The risks are actually, this may surprise, no risk.

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:18.580
Nothing could possibly go wrong.

01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:21.060
You have actually, yeah, there is actually no,

01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:23.540
there are so many risks you've actually negated the risk.

01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:26.420
The risks all cancel each other out.

01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:29.060
It's like algebra, algebra of dumb.

01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:32.660
It's like that scene in the cartoon where somebody like goes flying off a ledge and

01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:39.140
like bounces past the glass factory and over the tack truck and into like the pillow canal.

01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:40.660
Like that's, that's what's going to happen.

01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:44.260
What you've set yourself up with right now is a sleepwalking olive oil situation.

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:48.340
Just, just baby Huey all the way, you're fine.

01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:52.820
It's like a baby, basically it's a baby's day out of dumb shit to do your penis.

01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:53.860
Oh God.

01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:55.860
It's a penis day out.

01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:56.580
You are going to need-

01:08:56.580 --> 01:09:00.100
Hey, Chris Columbus, you're welcome for all these goddamn residuals that slide you today.

01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:02.420
Chris Columbus, you make me so sad.

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:09.220
You are going to need the sharpest scissors and all of that, all of the grace.

01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:10.980
And the steeliest will.

01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:14.420
Yeah, and steel wool to just get it around.

01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:21.220
What you really can't do is get halfway through and give up.

01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:23.460
This looks like a banker's visor down there.

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:25.860
Surgeon's mask.

01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:26.740
What's going on?

01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:30.500
It's like a blooming onion down there.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.260
That's some, that's some hanging Chad.

01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:34.740
It looks like I got a Pez dispenser.

01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:39.380
I would like to get a follow up on this though.

01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:42.180
Yeah, I'd like to talk to that kid's dad.

01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:44.980
It would just be a Yahoo answer that just read, oh no.

01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:47.700
No, no, no.

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:49.380
There's blood everywhere.

01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:52.660
Hey folks, before we let you go, just a little bit of housekeeping.

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:56.580

Go now, you fools.

01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:12.980
Fly you fools.

01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:16.180
Just a reminder, we are doing an all Totinos episode as a bonus.

01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:19.300
Midweek update about Totinos.

01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:20.740
We're very excited about it.

01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:24.180
If you have Totinos related questions, email us with Totinos in the subject line.

01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:26.580
What is that email address again, Trav?

01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:29.300
I think it's nbmbam at maximumfund.org.

01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:30.900
That is correct, Griffin.

01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:31.940
A swing and a hit.

01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:36.100
We also still have tickets on sale for our Pacific Northwest tour.

01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:37.220
We're going to be in Seattle.

01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:39.540
We're going to be in Portland too, but those tickets are sold out.

01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:44.020
We're going to be in Seattle on the 29th of August and Vancouver on the 30th of August.

01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:52.980
You can go to bit.ly forward slash nbmbam Seattle or bit.ly forward slash v-a-n-m-b-m-b-a-m

01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:53.860
for those tickets.

01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:57.380
And we might have another show to announce.

01:10:57.380 --> 01:10:57.780
Yeah, that's correct.

01:10:57.780 --> 01:10:59.220
That's the year coming up soon.

01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:00.420
So stay tuned for that.

01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:04.100
It will be on the west side of the country.

01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:05.380
But let me say this.

01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:10.740
There's additional news there that even if you're not in the area, you'll still get to watch it.

01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:12.900
So just stay tuned.

01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:13.940
It's very exciting.

01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:16.100
We're going to astrally project our podcast.

01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:17.540
Yeah, we'll basically just be in your brains.

01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:19.140
You'll need to sleep at the time of the show.

01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:20.100
Well, we won't be in your brain.

01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:22.660
We'll be in the crystal meeting place in the stars.

01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:23.620
That's fair.

01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:25.540
If you've got a second, hop on iTunes.

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:28.180
Throw us a rating review if you haven't before.

01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:29.860
Click that subscribe button if you haven't.

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:32.900
And if you have, if you've done all of that, tell your friends to do it.

01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:37.220
If you know people who are lazy and haven't rated and reviewed on iTunes, tell them to do it.

01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:39.060
Go check out our YouTube channel.

01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:40.660
Go listen to the other shows on Maximum Fun.

01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:41.540
There's tons of them.

01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:44.900
We do other stuff like The Adventure Zone and Sawbones and Bunker Buddies.

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:49.300
But then there's other shows we don't do like Judge John Hodgman, Stop Podcasting Yourself,

01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:51.540
Throwing Shade, a lot of really, really terrific shows.

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.780
Go to MaximumFun.org and check them out.

01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:57.780
There's also stuff that we do that's not on the network like Trends Like These,

01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:00.980
a show that Travis does with his buddy Brent, and Things I Bought at Sheets,

01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:05.780
a YouTube program that Justin does where he reviews food with his buddy, Dwight.

01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:09.860
We've got our irons and a lot of fires and there's a lot of fires to go around.

01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:11.540
So go set yourself on fire.

01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:15.300
We also want to say thank you to John Roderick in the long winters for letting us use our theme song,

01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:18.260
It's a Departure, off of the album Putting the Days to Bed.

01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:20.660
You can find that album on iTunes.

01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:22.340
You can probably find it on Amazon.

01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:27.540
You can probably find it at a local record shop.

01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:31.700
Maybe down at the, you can hear it at the Disco Tech.

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:34.820
Is it on Jay-Z's Zune?

01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:36.260
The Jay-Z's like Zune program?

01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:39.860
I forget what it's called, but it's his like, his answer to Zune music.

01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:40.980
It's on his Zune.

01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:44.660
If you can find his Zune, he left it last night at Comic-Con.

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:47.300
If you find Jay-Z's Zune, you can just mail it to us

01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:50.660
or there's an address written on the back in Sharp.

01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:51.700
You can just mail it to Jay-Z.

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:54.260
You know, on the Zune, let's talk about the Zune for a while.

01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:54.660
Okay.

01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:58.180
Because the Zune was great because you could share tracks between Zunes.

01:12:58.740 --> 01:12:59.540
And it wasn't permanent.

01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:01.940
It was either three days or three plays, whatever came first.

01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:04.020
But it was a really smart idea, right?

01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:06.980
Like, hey, here's this album I'm really into.

01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:09.620
It's called Putting the Days to Bed by the Long Winters.

01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:10.980
My name is Jay-Z.

01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:12.980
Would you like to go get a drink with me?

01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:13.300
Maybe go bowling?

01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:14.500
And that's how he got started.

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:16.180
And that's how I got started in the rap game.

01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:18.340
Anyway, thanks for listening.

01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:19.140
We'll be back next week.

01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:19.940
We'll be back next week.

01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:20.580
Don't worry about it.

01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:25.940
This one was sent in by Lisa Holofield.

01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:26.740
Thank you, Lisa.

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:30.340
It's by Yahoo Answers user Florex who asks,

01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:33.540
did anyone else hated Alan Alda in MASH?

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:40.500
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:41.860
I'm Griffin McElroy.

Who's been my brother?

01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:43.540
My brother and me.

01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:44.580
Kiss your dad.

01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:50.660
Square on the lips.

01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:52.420
Keep your heart, three stacks.

01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:53.460
Keep your heart.

01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:55.540
Hey, keep your heart, three stacks.

01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:56.580
Keep your heart.

01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:58.580
Man, these girls are smart, three stacks.

01:13:58.580 --> 01:13:59.700
These girls are smart.

01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:01.140
Play your part.

We're the Flophouse, one of the newest additions

01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:15.780
to the Maximum Fun Podcasting Network.

01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:17.060
I'm Dan McCoy.

01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:18.260
I'm Stuart Wellington.

01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:19.780
And I'm Elliot Kalin.

01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:22.500
What is the Flophouse, you may very well ask?

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.740
We watch a bad movie and then we talk about it.

01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:26.020
A bad movie podcast?

01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:28.580
Isn't that like every fifth podcast on the internet?

01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:30.340
I'd answer that by saying, one, we've

01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:32.260
been doing this show for over seven years,

01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:35.380
long before the entire premise of our show was a cliche.

01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:36.900
And two, shut up.

01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:38.100
Sick burn.

01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:40.820
I'd say that our show is more of a comedy podcast,

01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:43.060
a podcast about words that sound like other words,

01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:47.780
a podcast about me singing long irritating songs like this one,

01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:50.820
a podcast about pitches for a Ziggy comic book movie,

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:52.980
or discussions about sex tarps.

01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:55.860
Yeah, I mean, mostly it's a show about three friends just

01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:58.580
hanging out and talking about ding dongs.

01:14:58.580 --> 01:14:59.620
That's mostly used to.

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:00.500
Wait, what?

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:02.340
