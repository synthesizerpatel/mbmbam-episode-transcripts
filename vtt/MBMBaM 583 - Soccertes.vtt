WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

01:28.860 --> 01:30.860

What's happening? What's the big headlines for technology news today new computers? Yes. Yes new. Yeah

01:39.540 --> 01:45.560
Have you seen computers these days because used to be they took up like a whole football field basement

01:45.560 --> 01:49.180
And now you can hold those dang things in the palm of your hand and eat them

01:49.180 --> 01:56.340
And then there's Sony's got a new cyber glove, but that's not all we're talking about today. We're talking about cyber glove for cyber love

01:56.340 --> 02:02.300
Yeah, it's for jacking. But today we're talking about the biggest news of all and it's freaking

02:02.820 --> 02:04.820
Y'all heard of a little

02:05.180 --> 02:10.340
Website called Facebook that you don't want to see old old pictures. Yeah, it's got Nani

02:10.340 --> 02:14.560
Well that Nani's on it's got Nani and all those old high schoolers that you went to school

02:14.780 --> 02:19.380
Eight of our noni's cuz she keeps getting home. Oh my god. Yeah, step outside the bit for a second

02:19.380 --> 02:22.900
She does get hacked a lot though. She gets hacked all the time. She she

02:24.100 --> 02:25.780
Sorry

02:25.780 --> 02:29.300
Yeah, I mean she's got if any of you are listening, please don't hang on

02:30.020 --> 02:32.820
We know she's got anything left there for you

02:33.420 --> 02:39.180
Statistically speaking most of you have hacked or naughty at least one of you has a I also want to say so I don't get much

02:39.180 --> 02:43.220
tweets about I sound different this week cuz I'm I had a power outage at

02:43.600 --> 02:46.380
My home and I'm here at my wife's clinic

02:46.980 --> 02:50.300
Recording the podcast this was like the old days and he's doing a good old

02:50.300 --> 02:55.460
He's doing a little bit of medicine help for people who come I'm doing a couple band-aids and what have you?

02:55.460 --> 02:56.700
Yeah

02:56.700 --> 03:03.300
So anyway, big tech news exciting thing this Facebook website that are not keeps getting hacked on because she has so much fucking Bitcoin

03:04.340 --> 03:08.100
Is that it's gonna it's not gonna be a Facebook anymore

03:08.700 --> 03:12.540
And because that's been the problem the problem with Facebook is the name. Yeah

03:12.540 --> 03:19.460
Yeah, I know that there's been a lot of sort of reports about how they have fostered an environment that is good for hate speech

03:19.460 --> 03:21.100
but

03:21.100 --> 03:25.940
But that's all gonna be different now cuz it's not gonna be hate speech Facebook anymore

03:25.940 --> 03:30.940
It's gonna be something even cooler and safer and nicer, you know how Google

03:32.100 --> 03:36.100
Their their company motto is like don't be evil. Yeah, don't do bad

03:36.660 --> 03:39.600
Facebook's is like fuck it. Let's get it wet, right?

03:40.780 --> 03:42.860
Whatever it takes is there is their

03:43.580 --> 03:47.680
Yeah, Facebook's Facebook's motto is a rhetorical question. It's just what are you gonna do?

03:47.680 --> 03:54.280
What the Google change there's the company that owns Google and all the various Google paraphernalia

03:55.040 --> 03:57.040
including team google.com

03:57.480 --> 04:00.820
Especially team is me. No teen google.com is me

04:01.000 --> 04:04.800
They changed the alphabet and it'll be tough for Facebook to find something. It sounds as sinister as

04:05.440 --> 04:09.860
Alphabet. Yeah, so what about the Facebook? That's strong

04:10.200 --> 04:15.480
That's right, because then that's definitive right because it's been so wishy-washy like oh, let's check Facebook

04:15.480 --> 04:19.940
You're like which one right? And if you were just like, oh check the Facebook, right?

04:21.280 --> 04:26.800
No, no, okay. We're not changing the name of Facebook. It's very important here that we're clear about this

04:27.640 --> 04:31.320
Facebook will continue to operate in its own special way

04:31.360 --> 04:36.520
okay, that is so good for everybody as Facebook the company that owes Facebook and

04:37.040 --> 04:38.600
oculus and

04:38.600 --> 04:40.120
Instagram and

04:40.120 --> 04:43.880
You know probably 35 different ad companies

04:43.880 --> 04:51.220
Will change its name the parent company. Okay, so then just change it to Facebook senior. Yeah, it's Facebook's dad

04:51.680 --> 04:58.160
Yeah, this Facebook's dad Facebook senior. Mr. Facebook. So that way Facebook can say no, please. Call me Facebook. Mr. Facebook is my father

04:59.000 --> 05:05.040
Good Facebook would be neat because then it's like you don't have to sweat like the ethics of it

05:05.040 --> 05:08.480
It lets you know right there on the tin. Of course, there would have to be some behavioral

05:08.480 --> 05:15.920
Changes there. What am I really it's all branding. What about mr. Zucker's old-time Internet Palace?

05:16.400 --> 05:21.360
Yeah, well, that's got it. Like that's got a real geo cities vibe that I'm into. Yeah

05:21.920 --> 05:28.000
Retro, how about O'Callaghan's authentic Irish pub and Family Fun Center? Oh, I like that kicks ass

05:29.600 --> 05:31.200
Yeah

05:31.200 --> 05:36.140
If you are not gonna think there's anything weird about Facebook if it's suddenly one day

05:36.140 --> 05:42.620
a officially owned by O'Callaghan's our authentic Irish pub and Family Fun Center. Yeah, that's good

05:42.940 --> 05:47.020
They should sell it to Jolly Pirate Donut. Yeah, wait, so

05:47.820 --> 05:49.020
sell

05:49.020 --> 05:49.940
ownership

05:49.940 --> 05:58.300
Sell ownership of Facebook. Yeah, the company to Jolly Pirate Donut and then operate as like Jolly Pirate Donut is

05:58.500 --> 06:03.720
The company that owns Facebook and Instagram Facebook a Jolly Pirate production

06:03.720 --> 06:08.920
Mm-hmm. You'd be like a lot more down with it. And yeah, I mean it'd be cool to work then get

06:10.000 --> 06:14.100
Donut like free doughnuts and it would be nice for Nani to know that on the 12th time

06:14.100 --> 06:16.100
She got hacked the 13th one is free

06:18.480 --> 06:20.640
A baker's dozen hacks. Uh-huh

06:21.480 --> 06:22.960
I

06:22.960 --> 06:24.560
mean

06:24.560 --> 06:26.560
Zucks place could be fun

06:26.560 --> 06:28.360
Zucks place is good

06:28.360 --> 06:32.720
That would be a better name for the plat see I feel like they're gonna find a new name for the company and they're gonna

06:32.720 --> 06:37.080
Be like, well, this is so good. We got to change the website's name to Zucks place a

06:37.560 --> 06:40.160
Place for Zuck to come and hang out and let loose

06:41.040 --> 06:43.040
Maybe fun suckers

06:43.800 --> 06:47.080
Fun suckers fun suckers. Yeah

06:48.800 --> 06:51.040
Yeah, man, what's wrong with that

06:51.040 --> 06:55.640
I'm trying to think of the joke here. There's not a joke

06:59.080 --> 07:01.600
What about Dave and Zuckers while we're at it

07:09.400 --> 07:11.400
Zucky cheese

07:11.400 --> 07:19.360
Uh-huh. That's okay. These are all so good. We'll use that in oculus will become Zucky cheese

07:19.400 --> 07:24.600
Yeah, Facebook will be fun suckers, of course, and Instagram will be Dave and suckers

07:25.720 --> 07:29.080
All all of which are subsidiaries of Zucks place

07:30.880 --> 07:32.880
All which are owned by O'Callaghan's

07:32.880 --> 07:41.040
So you open up Zucks place and it's a it's like an animated gif of a map

07:41.680 --> 07:47.420
Unscrolling and it's like which which of Zucks amazing experiences would you like to dive into today?

07:47.760 --> 07:51.000
It's like oh, do you want to do you want to hack Clint McElroy's mom?

07:52.240 --> 07:54.240
Good news

07:54.560 --> 07:56.560
It's like a Club Penguin minigame

07:56.560 --> 08:05.160
Yeah, that's cool. That's awesome. I want I want all that shit on like let's not just limit it to Facebook and oculus and

08:06.400 --> 08:09.920
Instagram and all that like let's get neopets on there, but they're called

08:10.480 --> 08:13.920
Zucky beasts and there you go and have fun with them

08:15.360 --> 08:17.360
Mother suckers. Yeah

08:18.120 --> 08:21.320
Now you don't what what what would mother suckers be just

08:21.320 --> 08:26.280
the the the neopets thing

08:26.280 --> 08:28.280
Oh cuz they're like a virtual caregiver

08:28.280 --> 08:30.800
Little little mother suckers. Yeah

08:32.120 --> 08:37.160
Hey, can we do a garbage pail kid mark Zuckerberg thing? What would if they bought Facebook?

08:37.160 --> 08:42.460
If Zuck, if O'Callaghan's authentic Irish family fun center bought

08:43.920 --> 08:48.480
Garbage pail kids. Yeah, what would be a fun joke to say about Facebook?

08:48.480 --> 08:53.520
About like what kind of name could you get Zuck into garbage pail kids?

08:53.520 --> 08:57.600
Oh, you're saying like what's like a dirty joke? I don't have it. I don't have like a joke. Wild!

08:57.600 --> 08:59.600
Then that's a wild joke you just did Justin.

08:59.600 --> 09:03.200
Yeah, no, I was hoping you guys would have like a funny joke.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.600
You know sometimes on the show Justin

09:05.600 --> 09:11.200
One of us does like a bump set spike kind of maneuver and what you did is you set the ball in the middle of the

09:11.200 --> 09:14.960
Floor and said wouldn't it be cool if one of you spiked that? Yeah, someone figure

09:14.960 --> 09:18.280
You throw it in a garbage can across the street

09:18.280 --> 09:23.240
You know like someone figure out how to spike that and get a point like a lady in a toilet and said imagine if I had

09:23.240 --> 09:25.520
Spiked that. Yeah, sure. How cool would that be?

09:25.520 --> 09:30.720
It's like if there was no ball and you said imagine if there was a ball in the air and you could spike it. Yeah

09:32.200 --> 09:38.320
This is good times. This is good. This is good. Hey, thank you to Mark Zuckerberg for encouraging us to do that bit

09:39.400 --> 09:41.400
I'm sorry about everything

09:41.400 --> 09:48.400
We'll take your money right now. I don't know why. I'm not sorry. Sorry you fucked up so bad and made things so bad.

09:48.400 --> 09:51.400
Sorry Griffin. Griffin zucked up. It is legally done.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.400
Sorry you zucked up the entire fabric of our society.

09:53.400 --> 10:00.400
Can we stop for a second? I feel like the zuck sounds like fuck thing is so played. Like I'm sure he's got it later.

10:00.400 --> 10:07.400
Should we go the other way and say like Mark Fuckerberg, right? No guys. These are too obvious for us. We have we have

10:07.400 --> 10:15.400
Mark Mark Duckberg. What if he replaced himself with a cartoon duck named Mark Zuckerberg?

10:15.400 --> 10:23.400
And I see his brain inside the duck. Yeah, he's controlling it like alter ego that the new Alanis Morissette show. Uh-huh.

10:23.400 --> 10:28.400
I feel like he's controlling it and it's an animated duck that he controls named Mark Zuckerberg.

10:28.400 --> 10:31.400
I feel like if they do that, they don't even need to change the name of the company.

10:31.400 --> 10:34.400
No, that's gonna do a lot of PR work for them. Yeah.

10:34.400 --> 10:39.400
This is an advice show. I don't know if you've gotten that. We have a special guest this week. It's very exciting.

10:39.400 --> 10:45.400
Yeah, it's later though. Don't worry about it. Right now we're going to help you and we'll do other things too.

10:45.400 --> 10:54.400
But first the help. I recently started a job that at certain points involves driving a big truck that tows an even bigger trailer.

10:54.400 --> 10:59.400
Badass. Let's take a second to just badass. Badass dude.

10:59.400 --> 11:03.400
You know when you see a big truck you're like that's a big truck and then you see the even bigger trailer and you're like whoa.

11:03.400 --> 11:09.400
Shit. Real nice. I'm not the biggest fan of this job. Stupid. So I was planning on-

11:09.400 --> 11:12.400
Wait, hold on. Who's stupid? The question I was gonna ask.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.400
I just think it's stupid. They don't like that job. It'd be like so cool.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.400
Oh, I see. That's a bold stance.

11:16.400 --> 11:21.400
If you smash that truck into anything, it is donezo. Like that's gotta be empowering.

11:21.400 --> 11:25.400
Yeah. So I was planning on only keeping this job until I found a new one.

11:25.400 --> 11:30.400
Unfortunately, my second week on the job, I was towing the trailer on the interstate and the trailer jackknifed on me.

11:30.400 --> 11:34.400
Fuck. The truck rolled twice and landed upside down.

11:34.400 --> 11:37.400
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared.

11:37.400 --> 11:40.400
Nobody, including myself, was hurt.

11:40.400 --> 11:46.400
Okay. But now I feel like I can't quit because I totaled the truck and the trailer.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.400
Oh man. Accurate.

11:48.400 --> 11:52.400
Brothers, should I stick around a little bit longer or should I just piece the hell out?

11:52.400 --> 11:56.400
That's from career confusion at Colorado. That's a sticky wicked.

11:56.400 --> 12:01.400
Yeah, hold on, because I feel like I have a different feeling it seems than my brothers do.

12:01.400 --> 12:08.400
Because Justin, it seems that you are of the mindset that it is now difficult to quit after you jackknife and roll the truck and trailer.

12:08.400 --> 12:12.400
I, on the other hand, think that if you quit, your job will be like, oh thank god they quit.

12:12.400 --> 12:16.400
Yeah, at this point your boss would be like, oh yeah, that makes sense.

12:16.400 --> 12:21.400
I actually didn't even know you still worked here after you rolled the truck and trailer on your second week.

12:21.400 --> 12:26.400
You made a big spectacular exploder on day 14 it says here in your file.

12:26.400 --> 12:29.400
So yeah, it makes sense that you wouldn't want to be this job.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.400
You did what we in the business call a truck whoopsie.

12:31.400 --> 12:38.400
And that usually is a fireable offense and we actually just assumed you had quit already.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.400
What was in the trailer? Was it something funny?

12:40.400 --> 12:41.400
Oh god.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.400
You know, like bouncy balls or like...

12:43.400 --> 12:47.400
Oh boy. Yeah, this is good. This is good. Where are we going next?

12:47.400 --> 12:49.400
Oh, a bunch of like KY jelly.

12:49.400 --> 12:50.400
Yeah.

12:50.400 --> 12:58.400
And it spilled all over and like all the cars started slip sliding around and like porking.

12:58.400 --> 12:59.400
Huh.

12:59.400 --> 13:00.400
Yeah, I think...

13:00.400 --> 13:01.400
You lost it a little bit.

13:01.400 --> 13:14.400
I think you should, if you don't want to drive the big truck anymore because you crashed it pretty much instantly in the grand scheme of things, I feel like that's okay.

13:14.400 --> 13:22.400
I feel like they aren't going to keep you there and say like, no, you have to stay here and do this because...

13:22.400 --> 13:24.400
The only problem is that you...

13:24.400 --> 13:26.400
Well, I guess you needed the job for a little bit longer, right?

13:26.400 --> 13:28.400
You weren't ready to quit then.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.400
Yeah.

13:29.400 --> 13:32.400
You didn't want to quit because I was going to say like that's the moment.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.400
You jackknife it.

13:33.400 --> 13:36.400
Nobody's going to judge you for being like, I'm done.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.400
That's it.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.400
Never again.

13:38.400 --> 13:42.400
It sucks to drive a car this big on the same road.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.400
It's too big of a car.

13:43.400 --> 13:46.400
Can I deliver this in a Jetta maybe?

13:46.400 --> 13:52.400
God's mistake, this giant truck, we went too far as a species.

13:52.400 --> 13:55.400
Time to take it back.

13:55.400 --> 13:56.400
Yeah, you should.

13:56.400 --> 14:10.400
One time I got a job at Petsmart and on my first day of training, halfway through the training session, I got a call letting me know that I was actually supposed to be somewhere to perform a play that they had not told me.

14:10.400 --> 14:14.400
And it was like, you know, a thing that they sent out for, you know, like the touring thing.

14:14.400 --> 14:15.400
The life of an actor.

14:15.400 --> 14:16.400
I know.

14:16.400 --> 14:19.400
So I just like walked out of training and my boss was like, where are you going?

14:19.400 --> 14:21.400
And I was like, sorry, I just got a call.

14:21.400 --> 14:22.400
I gotta be somewhere else.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.400
Be back tomorrow.

14:24.400 --> 14:27.400
And when I came back the next day, they didn't fire me.

14:27.400 --> 14:31.400
So let that and this question be a combined sign to you, the listener.

14:31.400 --> 14:35.400
It's actually a lot harder to get fired from things than you would think.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.400
That's like the end of rent, Trav.

14:38.400 --> 14:39.400
I mean, I guess.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.400
Think about it.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.400
It's basically what rent's about.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.400
Hey, do you all want to talk to the wizard on the cloud?

14:44.400 --> 14:45.400
Call him up real quick.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.400
Yeah.

14:46.400 --> 14:47.400
You know what?

14:47.400 --> 14:48.400
How come he never calls us?

14:48.400 --> 14:49.400
Good point.

14:49.400 --> 14:50.400
Good question.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.400
I mean, because he's the wizard.

14:52.400 --> 14:53.400
All right.

14:53.400 --> 14:54.400
Let's see what the wizard's got for us today.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.400
A stinker.

14:56.400 --> 15:04.400
You know how it's a cool these days not to be like strong sports type, but like what?

15:04.400 --> 15:05.400
Yeah.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.400
Smart type.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.400
Oh, man.

15:07.400 --> 15:10.400
Well, this is going to help us sort of get there.

15:10.400 --> 15:11.400
Yeah.

15:11.400 --> 15:12.400
I'm sorry, buddy.

15:12.400 --> 15:13.400
I just didn't know.

15:13.400 --> 15:14.400
Okay.

15:14.400 --> 15:18.800
This one's going to make you very popular with a lot of people because it is how to

15:18.800 --> 15:20.400
live like Socrates.

15:20.400 --> 15:21.400
Oh.

15:21.400 --> 15:22.400
Yeah.

15:22.400 --> 15:23.400
And here's the thing.

15:23.400 --> 15:27.400
Here's what I'm excited about is that it worked out so good for Socrates.

15:27.400 --> 15:28.400
Yeah.

15:28.400 --> 15:29.400
Everybody loved that guy.

15:29.400 --> 15:34.400
Being Socrates and being like how he is was really great for him.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.400
Yeah.

15:35.400 --> 15:36.400
Yeah.

15:36.400 --> 15:40.400
So let's I mean, let's hop right into it because I think that some of this stuff is just timeless,

15:40.400 --> 15:41.400
right?

15:41.400 --> 15:43.400
So just start by reading some of Plato's dialogues.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.400
Actually, fuck that.

15:44.400 --> 15:45.400
That's so boring.

15:45.400 --> 15:46.400
Skip that part.

15:46.400 --> 15:47.400
No.

15:47.400 --> 15:48.400
That's a bad place to start.

15:48.400 --> 15:49.400
That's a wicked bad place to start.

15:49.400 --> 15:50.400
Where is it?

15:50.400 --> 15:51.400
What about that?

15:51.400 --> 15:53.400
Couldn't you start with the movie?

15:53.400 --> 15:54.400
Oh, yes.

15:54.400 --> 15:55.400
The one that Bill and Ted.

15:55.400 --> 15:58.400
The Keanu Reeves biopic.

15:58.400 --> 15:59.400
Is that right?

15:59.400 --> 16:00.400
No, no, no.

16:00.400 --> 16:06.400
The movie about Socrates with Channing Tatum as Socrates.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.400
Right.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.400
They made like a biopic.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.400
Magic Socrates.

16:09.400 --> 16:10.400
Yeah.

16:10.400 --> 16:14.400
I think it was called Magic Socrates.

16:14.400 --> 16:15.400
I think it was called Socrates.

16:15.400 --> 16:19.400
I love that at the end of the trailer, when he looks at the camera, loads the sunglasses

16:19.400 --> 16:23.400
and he's like, I guess you could say I'm pretty smart.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.400
Yeah.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.400
I like that.

16:25.400 --> 16:28.400
Then he looked down and said nothing platonic about this relationship.

16:28.400 --> 16:29.400
Yeah.

16:29.400 --> 16:30.400
Then he had sex with everybody.

16:30.400 --> 16:31.400
Yeah.

16:31.400 --> 16:32.400
Yeah.

16:32.400 --> 16:33.400
That was a good flick.

16:33.400 --> 16:35.400
I wish I knew more about Socrates.

16:35.400 --> 16:40.400
I wish I knew more about Magic Mike.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.400
So yeah, you got to read Plato's shit.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.400
I guess Plato was like a big Socrates fan.

16:44.400 --> 16:45.400
I'm going to show my hand here.

16:45.400 --> 16:47.400
I don't know fuck all about this dude.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.400
Which one?

16:48.400 --> 16:51.400
I thought about tossing him a quick Google.

16:51.400 --> 16:52.400
Sure, my boy.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.400
Quick Google.

16:53.400 --> 16:57.400
I know that that would throw off the metadata that Google has on me.

16:57.400 --> 17:03.400
Normally, Travis is looking up the voice actors of the show Avatar The Last Airbender and

17:03.400 --> 17:06.400
suddenly he's Googling the teachings of Plato.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.400
Do we need to start worrying about Travis being too smart?

17:09.400 --> 17:10.400
Oh, no, no, no.

17:10.400 --> 17:13.400
He's back to Googling voice actors of different cartoons.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.400
We're all good.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.400
Hey, here's the second one.

17:16.400 --> 17:21.400
This is a good tip for like any sort of thing you're trying to do with your life is don't

17:21.400 --> 17:22.400
change your life immediately.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.400
Do it gradually.

17:23.400 --> 17:29.400
If you do it too fast and you're like, I'm fucking Socrates now, like you're going to

17:29.400 --> 17:30.400
burn out too fast.

17:30.400 --> 17:33.400
You got to really step into it.

17:33.400 --> 17:40.400
Griffin, is there a heading in there of what to do when you want to be kind of contendered

17:40.400 --> 17:46.400
like the Socrates of say, and this is just the top of my head, but like soccer, so you

17:46.400 --> 17:51.400
can be Socrates and you're like the Socrates, you know, like the Socrates of soccer.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.400
Is there any instructions in there?

17:53.400 --> 17:56.400
Because that's kind of what I've always thought of myself as.

17:56.400 --> 17:57.400
The Socrates of soccer?

17:57.400 --> 17:58.400
Yeah.

17:58.400 --> 18:01.400
In that I bet he was also pretty bad at soccer.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.400
Yeah, exactly.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.400
So just start with these plain simple steps.

18:05.400 --> 18:06.400
Okay.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.400
Wear simpler clothes.

18:07.400 --> 18:09.400
That's going to be hard for me.

18:09.400 --> 18:10.400
Yeah, I don't know about that.

18:10.400 --> 18:11.400
I'm kind of a peacock.

18:11.400 --> 18:13.400
Sort of a real clothes peacock.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.400
Eat plainer foods.

18:15.400 --> 18:16.400
That a day I could swing with.

18:16.400 --> 18:17.400
I could hang with that.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.400
Yeah, that's good for advice for anybody.

18:19.400 --> 18:22.400
It'd probably be good for my belly.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.400
And then do not waste your money on material things.

18:24.400 --> 18:25.400
Well, I'm fucked.

18:25.400 --> 18:25.400
That's it.

18:25.400 --> 18:26.400
I'm done.

18:26.400 --> 18:29.400
Well, does that include like food?

18:29.400 --> 18:31.400
Spicy foods, maybe.

18:31.400 --> 18:34.400
Foods that are not just very plain.

18:34.400 --> 18:35.400
Yeah, probably.

18:35.400 --> 18:39.400
So next tip is to follow Socratic principles and ideals.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.400
Again, it's a real snooze fest.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.400
Yeah, that feels like a lot of research involved.

18:43.400 --> 18:44.400
Can't you just tell me?

18:44.400 --> 18:46.400
Yeah, I'll sort of give you the CliffsNotes version of it.

18:46.400 --> 18:49.400
And this is really where the article starts

18:49.400 --> 18:56.400
to maybe show how there are lots of people, especially

18:56.400 --> 18:59.400
on the internet, who follow Socratic principles and ideals

18:59.400 --> 19:02.400
and that nobody likes them.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.400
Oh, OK.

19:03.400 --> 19:06.400
Yeah, so just here's how to argue using the Socratic method.

19:06.400 --> 19:07.400
Question everything.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.400
Cool start.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.400
Do not merely take something at face value

19:11.400 --> 19:13.400
or do something because someone says so,

19:13.400 --> 19:16.400
whether it is one person or 100.

19:16.400 --> 19:21.400
Hey, can you stop fucking being a reply guy

19:21.400 --> 19:25.400
and just like jumping in there whenever anyone says anything

19:25.400 --> 19:28.400
and being an asshole and saying like, are you sure?

19:28.400 --> 19:31.400
But that's what Socrates does it.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.400
That's what Socrates does it.

19:33.400 --> 19:36.400
Yeah, I think health care is a human right.

19:36.400 --> 19:37.400
Is it though?

19:37.400 --> 19:39.400
Thanks, Socrates.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.400
I have to question it.

19:41.400 --> 19:44.400
Like everybody's out here saying it's cool to not die

19:44.400 --> 19:46.400
because you don't have enough money.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.400
But is it though?

19:47.400 --> 19:51.400
It's me, Socrates.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.400
If you truly wish to live like Socrates,

19:53.400 --> 19:56.400
then you need to devote yourself entirely to philosophy

19:56.400 --> 19:58.400
and searching for truth.

19:58.400 --> 19:59.400
Which if you have a-

19:59.400 --> 20:00.400
That person's great too.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.400
That person's really cool.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.400
If you have a WikiHow membership,

20:04.400 --> 20:06.400
you're already halfway there, baby.

20:06.400 --> 20:07.400
You're already there.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.400
Can I just say right now, Socrates right now,

20:09.400 --> 20:13.400
what I've learned basically in the last five minutes,

20:13.400 --> 20:15.400
he seems like the type of person now

20:15.400 --> 20:17.400
who would say like, I don't watch TV

20:17.400 --> 20:21.400
and I wouldn't really want to talk to that person.

20:21.400 --> 20:24.400
Yeah, I mean, back in the day, I get it, right?

20:24.400 --> 20:27.400
If back in the day they're like, oh man,

20:27.400 --> 20:31.400
we got to kill a hundred of our own people every year

20:31.400 --> 20:34.400
or else the sun will devour us.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.400
And it was probably good for Socrates to step in there

20:37.400 --> 20:40.400
and be like, can I maybe suggest

20:40.400 --> 20:44.400
that we don't have to sacrifice our people

20:44.400 --> 20:47.400
because maybe the sun won't swallow us up?

20:47.400 --> 20:50.400
Yeah, it is like, back then we didn't do anything.

20:50.400 --> 20:51.400
Yeah.

20:51.400 --> 20:52.400
So yeah, question all of it.

20:52.400 --> 20:55.400
But now it's like, we got it.

20:55.400 --> 20:56.400
We got it.

20:56.400 --> 20:57.400
You know what?

20:57.400 --> 20:58.400
I'll take it one step further

20:58.400 --> 21:00.400
and say back in Socrates' time,

21:00.400 --> 21:01.400
it was also probably really easy

21:01.400 --> 21:04.400
not to buy material goods or eat spicy foods

21:04.400 --> 21:06.400
because the stuff they had was bunk.

21:06.400 --> 21:07.400
But now Socrates is like,

21:07.400 --> 21:09.400
did you see those fucking sneakers, dude?

21:09.400 --> 21:11.400
I had to buy them.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.400
They were really cool.

21:12.400 --> 21:15.400
And I just heard that this new Indian place

21:15.400 --> 21:16.400
opened up down the street

21:16.400 --> 21:18.400
and I got to check that shit out.

21:18.400 --> 21:21.400
Make sure where you debate with others is in a public area.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.400
I think Twitter counts like that.

21:23.400 --> 21:24.400
Man, there's a lot of people out there

21:24.400 --> 21:26.400
trying to be Socrates.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.400
Never be afraid to voice what you think

21:28.400 --> 21:30.400
or more importantly, the truth.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.400
Hey, it's cool to complete those two things.

21:32.400 --> 21:33.400
Socrates sucks.

21:33.400 --> 21:36.400
Yeah, like Socrates,

21:36.400 --> 21:38.400
I feel like those are different ideas.

21:38.400 --> 21:39.400
The truth is the things that you do.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.400
No, no, no, no.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.400
I think it's important to be Socrates

21:42.400 --> 21:47.400
to know 100% whatever you think is right.

21:47.400 --> 21:48.400
Question everything,

21:48.400 --> 21:51.400
unless it's one of your sweet little thought bubbles.

21:51.400 --> 21:54.400
Question everything except your own thoughts and ideas.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.400
Those, solid.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.400
Those, truth, truth.

21:57.400 --> 21:58.400
Hey, here's a universal.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.400
This is a bad-ass one

21:59.400 --> 22:03.400
and maybe the most attainable one.

22:03.400 --> 22:06.400
And that is number seven, never fear death.

22:06.400 --> 22:09.400
Cool, cool, cool.

22:09.400 --> 22:10.400
Maybe that's oh.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.400
Let me flip this switch.

22:12.400 --> 22:13.400
Boom.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.400
Maybe that's why Twitter reply guys

22:15.400 --> 22:18.400
are so cocksure all the time

22:18.400 --> 22:21.400
is because they don't spend an hour of their day

22:21.400 --> 22:24.400
just thinking about death.

22:24.400 --> 22:27.400
I have wondered how they get so much done.

22:27.400 --> 22:29.400
For other shit.

22:29.400 --> 22:30.400
They don't fear death.

22:30.400 --> 22:33.400
That's daredevil shit.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.400
Socrates was wasting his time

22:35.400 --> 22:37.400
with all the philosophy and stuff.

22:37.400 --> 22:39.400
He should have been defending the innocent

22:39.400 --> 22:40.400
in Hell's Kitchen or whatever.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.400
They didn't have kitchens back then.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.400
One thing I do know about Socrates

22:44.400 --> 22:46.400
is he got sentenced to death

22:46.400 --> 22:48.400
for all of his cool thoughts.

22:48.400 --> 22:54.400
And then the day before he got his just desserts,

22:54.400 --> 22:57.400
he had a bunch of buddies who swung by

22:57.400 --> 22:58.400
and they're like Socrates,

22:58.400 --> 22:59.400
we're going to get you out of here, buddy.

22:59.400 --> 23:01.400
And he was like, nah, they got me.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.400
And then he drank him off and beat it.

23:03.400 --> 23:05.400
His buddies are like, come on, dude, we got to go.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.400
Your brain is so special and you got to help.

23:07.400 --> 23:10.400
Nah, they got me fair and square guys.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.400
I ain't scared.

23:11.400 --> 23:12.400
I ain't scared.

23:12.400 --> 23:13.400
They did a trial fair and square.

23:13.400 --> 23:16.400
Yeah, but the trial was like a hundred

23:16.400 --> 23:18.400
extremely religious people who were like,

23:18.400 --> 23:19.400
no, he stinks.

23:19.400 --> 23:21.400
They got me.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.400
Bye.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.400
And also, I think it's a big assumption

23:24.400 --> 23:27.400
to assume that Socrates wasn't afraid of death

23:27.400 --> 23:28.400
just because he never wrote down like,

23:28.400 --> 23:30.400
fucking death has got me shitting myself, dude.

23:30.400 --> 23:32.400
Yeah, maybe he was just so busy

23:32.400 --> 23:34.400
thinking all of his cool thoughts

23:34.400 --> 23:36.400
that he just didn't even think to buy.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.400
And so he guzzled down that sweet hemlock

23:38.400 --> 23:39.400
and then he was like, wait a minute.

23:39.400 --> 23:43.400
This is, this is what death.

23:43.400 --> 23:46.400
Maybe he sucked so bad his friends handed him hemlock

23:46.400 --> 23:48.400
and were like, hey, this is like a wheatgrass shot.

23:48.400 --> 23:50.400
And he was like, okay,

23:50.400 --> 23:51.400
you guys are going to get me out of here.

23:51.400 --> 23:53.400
Like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you got it.

23:53.400 --> 23:55.400
But take that wheatgrass shot first.

23:55.400 --> 23:56.400
And then they walked out and like, wait,

23:56.400 --> 23:58.400
I thought you guys were going to go help Socrates.

23:58.400 --> 23:59.400
Oh, we tried.

23:59.400 --> 24:00.400
We really tried.

24:00.400 --> 24:01.400
But he said.

24:01.400 --> 24:03.400
Alternatively, his friends were like, dude,

24:03.400 --> 24:04.400
you cannot beef it.

24:04.400 --> 24:05.400
That is going to stink.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.400
And he was like, well, I have to fucking question that.

24:07.400 --> 24:08.400
Damn it.

24:08.400 --> 24:09.400
Damn it.

24:09.400 --> 24:11.400
I wasn't gonna, I didn't want to beef it.

24:11.400 --> 24:12.400
But now.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.400
Now everybody's talking about how bad being dead is.

24:14.400 --> 24:17.400
And I was like, shit, I gotta question it, right?

24:17.400 --> 24:19.400
I'm the great philosopher.

24:19.400 --> 24:20.400
So crazy.

24:20.400 --> 24:21.400
I'm so great.

24:21.400 --> 24:22.400
I'm so great, Tim.

24:22.400 --> 24:23.400
Show humility.

24:23.400 --> 24:24.400
Yeah, that's not.

24:24.400 --> 24:27.400
Those ideas don't really mishmash together.

24:27.400 --> 24:28.400
I don't trust anything you say.

24:28.400 --> 24:29.400
But hey, that's just me.

24:29.400 --> 24:30.400
That's just me.

24:30.400 --> 24:31.400
That's just me.

24:31.400 --> 24:33.400
My thing is that truth is knowable.

24:33.400 --> 24:36.400
And I've got it here in my pocket.

24:36.400 --> 24:37.400
The next one is so boring.

24:37.400 --> 24:38.400
I don't even want to talk about it.

24:38.400 --> 24:41.400
But remember the Socratic paradoxes.

24:41.400 --> 24:42.400
Yeah, obviously.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.400
Stick to your principles even in the face of death

24:44.400 --> 24:47.400
as Socrates did as described in Phaedo.

24:47.400 --> 24:48.400
Phaedo.

24:48.400 --> 24:49.400
Which I suppose is a cool book.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.400
Listen, you all know me.

24:51.400 --> 24:53.400
I'm a pretty cool dude, right?

24:53.400 --> 24:54.400
Very cool.

24:54.400 --> 24:57.400
If I'm facing death, I'm going to do whatever it takes

24:57.400 --> 24:58.400
to get out of there.

24:58.400 --> 24:59.400
You know what I mean?

24:59.400 --> 25:00.400
Sure, sure.

25:00.400 --> 25:01.400
I'll sign anything.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.400
I will say anything.

25:03.400 --> 25:05.400
I'll make fun of anybody.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.400
And then later be like, I didn't.

25:07.400 --> 25:08.400
Nope, not true.

25:08.400 --> 25:09.400
I totally didn't.

25:09.400 --> 25:11.400
But anyways, I'm still eating this hamburger right here

25:11.400 --> 25:14.400
and loving it.

25:14.400 --> 25:16.400
Be sure to know thyself.

25:16.400 --> 25:17.400
That scene.

25:17.400 --> 25:18.400
Of course.

25:18.400 --> 25:21.400
You clearly don't, though, because you're like,

25:21.400 --> 25:25.400
I know myself, but I'd rather know myself as Socrates.

25:25.400 --> 25:28.400
Knowing thyself is a lot easier when no one else

25:28.400 --> 25:29.400
really wants you to know them.

25:29.400 --> 25:30.400
Yes.

25:30.400 --> 25:31.400
So it frees up a lot.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.400
I don't actually want to spend that much time

25:33.400 --> 25:34.400
letting you get to know me,

25:34.400 --> 25:36.400
so you should probably just know yourself.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.400
That's probably a better use of your time.

25:37.400 --> 25:41.400
And meet distinguished or influential people.

25:41.400 --> 25:42.400
Yeah, that's easy enough.

25:42.400 --> 25:43.400
Hey, what's up?

25:43.400 --> 25:44.400
Is this Zach Braff?

25:44.400 --> 25:46.400
Come here, my cool farts.

25:46.400 --> 25:47.400
Zach Braff?

25:47.400 --> 25:48.400
Zach Braff?

25:48.400 --> 25:50.400
You're going to love them.

25:50.400 --> 25:53.400
And finally, remember that truth is the most important thing ever,

25:53.400 --> 25:56.400
and you must do all you can to find it.

25:56.400 --> 26:00.400
That's a cool one, because I don't think about things that way

26:00.400 --> 26:01.400
even a little bit.

26:01.400 --> 26:02.400
No.

26:02.400 --> 26:06.400
Truth, wildly subjective and often incredibly hurtful.

26:06.400 --> 26:10.400
Well, I mean, it's good to not live in fantasy times

26:10.400 --> 26:15.400
where you think that vaccines don't make you jump as good

26:15.400 --> 26:17.400
or whatever.

26:17.400 --> 26:18.400
True.

26:18.400 --> 26:21.400
But there's also so much other cool shit you can do in the world,

26:21.400 --> 26:22.400
like ride a roller coaster.

26:22.400 --> 26:24.400
Or VR experiences.

26:24.400 --> 26:26.400
A virtual reality experience.

26:26.400 --> 26:30.400
Yeah, I can't dedicate all my time to, you know,

26:30.400 --> 26:33.400
cracking open the Shelby Woo mystery files.

26:33.400 --> 26:34.400
You know what I mean?

26:34.400 --> 26:36.400
I got a lot on my plate right now.

26:36.400 --> 26:41.400
Do you think because Socrates didn't eat food with any flavor

26:41.400 --> 26:42.400
and didn't own cool shit,

26:42.400 --> 26:44.400
that's why he wasn't afraid of death?

26:44.400 --> 26:46.400
Because he was like, what am I even doing?

26:46.400 --> 26:47.400
You know what I mean?

26:47.400 --> 26:49.400
I'm filling my time with you, Jags.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.400
I can't wait to get out of here.

26:51.400 --> 26:54.400
One of those stinkers that didn't like it was like,

26:54.400 --> 26:55.400
you've never had spices?

26:55.400 --> 26:56.400
Dude, you've got to try this one.

26:56.400 --> 26:57.400
It's called Himlock.

26:57.400 --> 27:03.400
It's got good umami potential.

27:03.400 --> 27:06.400
And you know Plato was waiting in the wings.

27:06.400 --> 27:07.400
And he was like, Plato?

27:07.400 --> 27:09.400
You know more about flavors than I do.

27:09.400 --> 27:10.400
Is this cool?

27:10.400 --> 27:11.400
And Plato was like, definitely.

27:11.400 --> 27:12.400
Go for it.

27:12.400 --> 27:13.400
Delicious.

27:13.400 --> 27:14.400
It's going to be good.

27:14.400 --> 27:15.400
What'd you say?

27:15.400 --> 27:16.400
Nothing.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.400
I've written a cool book about how cool you are

27:18.400 --> 27:19.400
even though you're dead.

27:19.400 --> 27:23.400
And it's in a holding pattern for obvious reasons.

27:23.400 --> 27:26.400
A lot of publishers interested, just waiting for the finish.

27:26.400 --> 27:31.400
Just waiting for the ending.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.400
We're going to take a quick break right now.

27:33.400 --> 27:36.400
I want to stop doing the hard part of this job

27:36.400 --> 27:38.400
and do the easy part, which is selling,

27:38.400 --> 27:42.400
which is my true passion is products.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.400
So let's do that now.

27:43.400 --> 27:55.400
In a little segment we tend to call the money sound.

27:55.400 --> 27:57.400
Wrap yourself in a dream.

27:57.400 --> 27:58.400
That's right.

27:58.400 --> 28:01.400
I'm telling you about Brooklinen.

28:01.400 --> 28:05.400
And here's what's great is when you say Brooklinen, right?

28:05.400 --> 28:07.400
It kind of sounds like Brooklyn.

28:07.400 --> 28:08.400
You ever notice that?

28:08.400 --> 28:09.400
Yeah.

28:09.400 --> 28:10.400
Hi, I'm Travis McElroy,

28:10.400 --> 28:14.400
spokesperson and best friend of Brooklinen.

28:14.400 --> 28:17.400
They told me that they like me better than anyone else.

28:17.400 --> 28:18.400
Makes sense.

28:18.400 --> 28:20.400
And it's because I sleep on their sheets.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.400
Not by force.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.400
No one's making me do it.

28:23.400 --> 28:25.400
I chose to do it.

28:25.400 --> 28:27.400
That is what you would have to say though.

28:27.400 --> 28:31.400
No, Griffin, I promise you of my own volition and free will,

28:31.400 --> 28:32.400
I sleep on Brooklinen's sheets.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.400
Still things that you would say if being sort of.

28:34.400 --> 28:36.400
No one is here making me.

28:36.400 --> 28:38.400
No one's standing right next to me

28:38.400 --> 28:40.400
telling me what to say with an earpiece

28:40.400 --> 28:44.400
and like some written notes that are scrawled in an angry hand, right?

28:44.400 --> 28:48.400
I am choosing to say of my own experience

28:48.400 --> 28:54.400
how comfortable and life changing Brooklinen can be.

28:54.400 --> 28:57.400
A lot of people think that their sheets don't stink.

28:57.400 --> 28:58.400
Okay.

28:58.400 --> 29:01.400
But maybe yours do and you should check out Brooklinen.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.400
Yeah, that's good.

29:03.400 --> 29:04.400
Hi, I'm Justin McElroy.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.400
Travis, take a back seat.

29:06.400 --> 29:08.400
Juice has got it from here, I think.

29:08.400 --> 29:09.400
Okay.

29:09.400 --> 29:10.400
We got a lot of ads to get through

29:10.400 --> 29:12.400
and honestly, Travis is taking too long.

29:12.400 --> 29:14.400
These are great sheets.

29:14.400 --> 29:17.400
If you don't think so, you don't know fuck all about comfort

29:17.400 --> 29:19.400
and Brooklinen's are great to give as a gift.

29:19.400 --> 29:23.400
Once you experience it, it is a actual mortal sin

29:23.400 --> 29:25.400
to not want to share it with other people you love.

29:25.400 --> 29:26.400
Yeah.

29:26.400 --> 29:30.400
I love every Brooklinen thing I've ever owned

29:30.400 --> 29:32.400
more than my next breath.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.400
I mean, it is the-

29:34.400 --> 29:35.400
More than Zach Braff.

29:35.400 --> 29:38.400
More than Zach Braff, more than Braff Zachary,

29:38.400 --> 29:40.400
more than scrubs.

29:40.400 --> 29:41.400
What?

29:41.400 --> 29:42.400
I'm sorry.

29:42.400 --> 29:43.400
That's just the way I feel.

29:43.400 --> 29:44.400
Go.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.400
There's a gift guide so you can find the perfect present

29:46.400 --> 29:48.400
from Brooklinen at every price point.

29:48.400 --> 29:51.400
You just go to Brooklinen.com, use the promo code MYBROTHER

29:51.400 --> 29:56.400
and you can get $20 off with a minimum purchase of $100.

29:56.400 --> 30:01.400
That's B-R-O-O-K-L-I-N-E-N.com

30:01.400 --> 30:02.400
and enter promo code MYBROTHER.

30:02.400 --> 30:06.400
Brooklinen.com, promo code MYBROTHER.

30:06.400 --> 30:08.400
Justin, now that we're out of the ad,

30:08.400 --> 30:10.400
do you want to take back what you said about scrubs?

30:10.400 --> 30:12.400
Yeah, I actually, they're not paying me anymore

30:12.400 --> 30:13.400
so scrubs is the best.

30:13.400 --> 30:15.400
It's better than new sheets.

30:15.400 --> 30:16.400
Okay, great.

30:16.400 --> 30:17.400
I'm assuming they were asopolis-ing.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.400
Clothes go on your body and make you look cool

30:19.400 --> 30:20.400
and they make you look not like everybody else

30:20.400 --> 30:23.400
who's wearing different clothes.

30:23.400 --> 30:25.400
Your clothes are going to be better than theirs though

30:25.400 --> 30:27.400
because you're getting them from Stitch Fix.

30:27.400 --> 30:29.400
Stitch Fix is the best because you don't have to go

30:29.400 --> 30:31.400
to a building where they are like,

30:31.400 --> 30:32.400
here's a million shirts.

30:32.400 --> 30:34.400
Most of them won't fit you good.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.400
You're like, fuck.

30:35.400 --> 30:38.400
They do a quiz for you, but like a fun quiz

30:38.400 --> 30:39.400
where they're like, what do you like?

30:39.400 --> 30:41.400
What size is everything?

30:41.400 --> 30:42.400
And you tell them and then you get clothes

30:42.400 --> 30:46.400
specifically for your body, your style.

30:46.400 --> 30:50.400
They also have Stitch Fix Freestyle

30:50.400 --> 30:52.400
where you can just pick stuff yourself

30:52.400 --> 30:54.400
from a range of over a thousand brands,

30:54.400 --> 30:57.400
personalized though to your size and fit.

30:57.400 --> 30:58.400
And there's no subscription required.

30:58.400 --> 31:01.400
They offer free shipping, returns and exchanges.

31:01.400 --> 31:02.400
You gotta do it.

31:02.400 --> 31:03.400
You gotta do it.

31:03.400 --> 31:04.400
I got a Stitch Fix box waiting for me downstairs.

31:04.400 --> 31:05.400
I haven't cracked open yet.

31:05.400 --> 31:06.400
Stoked out of my gourd.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.400
So get started today by filling out your style quiz

31:08.400 --> 31:10.400
at stitchfix.com slash my brother.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.400
That's stitchfix.com slash my brother

31:12.400 --> 31:14.400
to try Stitch Fix Freestyle.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.400
Stitchfix.com slash my brother.

31:16.400 --> 31:18.400
Now listen, we're going to talk about Zip Recruiter here

31:18.400 --> 31:23.400
and Zip Recruiter, listen, it's not fun looking for a job.

31:23.400 --> 31:24.400
We've all done it.

31:24.400 --> 31:25.400
And you know what?

31:25.400 --> 31:26.400
I'm going to say it.

31:26.400 --> 31:28.400
It huffs farts, right?

31:28.400 --> 31:29.400
Yeah, big time.

31:29.400 --> 31:31.400
And Zip Recruiter has encouraged us now

31:31.400 --> 31:34.400
to talk about things we'd rather do

31:34.400 --> 31:36.400
instead of looking for a job.

31:36.400 --> 31:39.400
And I would rather.

31:39.400 --> 31:40.400
There he goes.

31:40.400 --> 31:41.400
Get out of its way.

31:41.400 --> 31:46.400
Eat the space needle slowly, one bite at a time

31:46.400 --> 31:49.400
over 10 years, then look for a job.

31:49.400 --> 31:51.400
But now that I've said that, I think eventually

31:51.400 --> 31:53.400
I could probably turn that into money or get arrested.

31:53.400 --> 31:55.400
I don't even know, you know?

31:55.400 --> 31:56.400
Right.

31:56.400 --> 31:57.400
Definitely.

31:57.400 --> 31:59.400
So quick, I'm going to do a really fun game

31:59.400 --> 32:01.400
right here for our listeners.

32:01.400 --> 32:05.400
If you can tell me what this ad is about,

32:05.400 --> 32:07.400
like what the company this ad is for

32:07.400 --> 32:09.400
after the last minute of this show

32:09.400 --> 32:11.400
and it hasn't completely glazed over

32:11.400 --> 32:19.400
and exited your brain, I will send you $2.50.

32:19.400 --> 32:20.400
Because there's no way.

32:20.400 --> 32:24.400
I'm part of the show and I forget what the advertiser is.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.400
It's about how to eat the space needle.

32:26.400 --> 32:27.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:27.400 --> 32:29.400
But like what's the company that gives us-

32:29.400 --> 32:31.400
The ad, the person who wrote the chat.

32:31.400 --> 32:32.400
Oh, right, right, right, right, right.

32:32.400 --> 32:34.400
Well, it's ZipRecruiter.

32:34.400 --> 32:36.400
And you know, it doesn't have to be boring

32:36.400 --> 32:37.400
to look for a job.

32:37.400 --> 32:40.400
They figured out how to make the job process better

32:40.400 --> 32:41.400
and a lot easier.

33:25.400 --> 33:27.400
Well, hello, I'm Renee Colvert.

33:27.400 --> 33:29.400
Hi, I'm Alexis Preston, and we are the hosts

33:29.400 --> 33:30.400
of Can I Pet Your Dog?

33:30.400 --> 33:31.400
And we got breaking news.

33:31.400 --> 33:34.400
We got an expose that all the beans have been spilled

33:34.400 --> 33:37.400
via an Apple podcast review that said,

33:37.400 --> 33:40.400
this show isn't well researched.

33:40.400 --> 33:41.400
Well, yeah, no duh.

33:41.400 --> 33:42.400
Of course, it's not.

33:42.400 --> 33:45.400
Not since the day we started has it been well researched.

33:45.400 --> 33:48.400
Guessing and anthropomorphizing dogs is what we do.

33:48.400 --> 33:50.400
The Can I Pet Your Dog promise

33:50.400 --> 33:53.400
is that we will never do more than 10 seconds of research

33:53.400 --> 33:56.400
before telling you excitedly about any dog we see.

33:56.400 --> 34:00.400
I'm gonna come at you with top 10 enthusiasm, minimal facts.

34:00.400 --> 34:02.400
We're here for a good time, not an educated time.

34:02.400 --> 34:04.400
So if you love dogs and you don't love research,

34:04.400 --> 34:06.400
well, you know what, come on in

34:06.400 --> 34:08.400
to Can I Pet Your Dog podcast every Tuesday

34:08.400 --> 34:10.400
on Maximum Fun Network.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.400
Hey, now that ZipRecruiter's gone,

34:16.400 --> 34:18.400
you remember when we said they told us

34:18.400 --> 34:20.400
we could talk about things we'd rather do than look for a job?

34:20.400 --> 34:21.400
Yeah.

34:21.400 --> 34:23.400
They included four examples.

34:23.400 --> 34:27.400
And the second one is eat dry, salty crackers.

34:27.400 --> 34:28.400
Yeah.

34:28.400 --> 34:29.400
Do they know?

34:29.400 --> 34:32.400
Do they know about you and the stuff you're into?

34:32.400 --> 34:36.400
Do they know about your dry sensibilities?

34:36.400 --> 34:38.400
It's like somebody who's never struggled.

34:38.400 --> 34:40.400
I feel like this was written by someone

34:40.400 --> 34:42.400
who's never had actual challenge in their life.

34:42.400 --> 34:44.400
Because eating dry, salty crackers,

34:44.400 --> 34:47.400
that might not even be a negative.

34:47.400 --> 34:49.400
Yeah, some people like those.

34:49.400 --> 34:51.400
I mean, they also included watching a documentary

34:51.400 --> 34:53.400
about sea slugs, which I would happily do.

34:53.400 --> 34:54.400
They're fascinating creatures.

34:54.400 --> 34:55.400
Yeah.

34:55.400 --> 34:58.400
And it also says to hear about my mother-in-law's bunion surgery,

34:58.400 --> 35:01.400
which like, sorry that I'm concerned about-

35:01.400 --> 35:03.400
Yeah, sorry that I love my mother-in-law so much

35:03.400 --> 35:07.400
and she's in pain and she had surgery?

35:07.400 --> 35:09.400
Yeah.

35:09.400 --> 35:10.400
What?

35:10.400 --> 35:15.400
I said.

35:15.400 --> 35:19.400
Oh, spooky.

35:19.400 --> 35:21.400
I want a Munch Squad.

35:21.400 --> 35:23.400
Squad.

35:23.400 --> 35:26.400
I want to Munch Squad.

35:26.400 --> 35:30.400
Squad.

35:30.400 --> 35:31.400
Welcome to Munch Squad.

35:31.400 --> 35:32.400
It's podcast to the podcast,

35:32.400 --> 35:35.400
profiling the latest and greatest in brand eating.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.400
It is no longer being sunset.

35:37.400 --> 35:40.400
It has been revived for season five.

35:40.400 --> 35:41.400
So I'm so excited to have-

35:41.400 --> 35:42.400
Now on Netflix.

35:42.400 --> 35:44.400
It's been picked up.

35:44.400 --> 35:46.400
It's now streaming.

35:46.400 --> 35:49.400
It wasn't right for broadcast television anymore,

35:49.400 --> 35:53.400
but thanks to all of you who sent in your old hamburger wrappers.

35:53.400 --> 35:54.400
They picked it up.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.400
There's a protest.

35:56.400 --> 35:57.400
On Quibi.

35:57.400 --> 35:59.400
Arby's, I just want to, this is quick,

35:59.400 --> 36:02.400
Arby's is going to launch Boneless Wings

36:02.400 --> 36:04.400
for a limited time this week.

36:04.400 --> 36:05.400
Neat.

36:05.400 --> 36:08.400
They like, they've already got nuggets.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.400
Yeah.

36:09.400 --> 36:10.400
So actually fuck off.

36:10.400 --> 36:11.400
Yeah.

36:11.400 --> 36:12.400
You know what I mean?

36:12.400 --> 36:16.400
Like they've actually, this kind of thing.

36:16.400 --> 36:18.400
Okay.

36:18.400 --> 36:19.400
I think that was it.

36:19.400 --> 36:20.400
Hey boys.

36:20.400 --> 36:21.400
Hello.

36:21.400 --> 36:22.400
Sorry.

36:22.400 --> 36:23.400
I had to take care of Justin.

36:23.400 --> 36:24.400
Two in a row.

36:24.400 --> 36:25.400
Count Donut.

36:25.400 --> 36:28.400
Well, he said.

36:28.400 --> 36:30.400
And also Griffin, a limited window

36:30.400 --> 36:32.400
where are we going to have Count Donut on

36:32.400 --> 36:33.400
and it makes any kind of sense.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.400
Yeah, that's fair.

36:35.400 --> 36:37.400
Oh, it's kind of late breaking.

36:37.400 --> 36:38.400
I've got the paper.

36:38.400 --> 36:42.400
This is late breaking is exactly it.

36:42.400 --> 36:44.400
I'm very frustrated.

36:44.400 --> 36:48.400
And when I'm angry, I don't always sound like myself.

36:48.400 --> 36:50.400
So I'm going to bring the energy down,

36:50.400 --> 36:52.400
but no, I'm holding back the range

36:52.400 --> 36:54.400
with everything in my multi.

36:54.400 --> 36:55.400
Okay.

36:55.400 --> 36:56.400
All right, what's, what's, what's.

36:56.400 --> 36:57.400
I am Count Donut.

36:57.400 --> 36:58.400
Yeah, we, yes.

36:58.400 --> 36:59.400
Wow, we know.

36:59.400 --> 37:00.400
Yeah.

37:00.400 --> 37:02.400
I am called and summoned, if you will,

37:02.400 --> 37:06.400
when Donut News is breaking in this segment.

37:06.400 --> 37:07.400
And last week-

37:07.400 --> 37:09.400
Is the killing of Justin part of that

37:09.400 --> 37:11.400
or is that just for funsies?

37:11.400 --> 37:17.400
I, I inhabit Justin's body and I need it to function.

37:17.400 --> 37:18.400
Huh.

37:18.400 --> 37:19.400
So here's the thing.

37:19.400 --> 37:21.400
That's a new Wrinkle in the Vampire kind of mythology,

37:21.400 --> 37:22.400
isn't it?

37:22.400 --> 37:23.400
Yeah.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.400
Well, it's Justin's intrigue.

37:25.400 --> 37:29.400
Me and, me and Richard Stink share the vessel

37:29.400 --> 37:30.400
when we need to.

37:30.400 --> 37:31.400
Huh.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.400
And we bumped into Richard in here.

37:33.400 --> 37:34.400
It was awkward.

37:34.400 --> 37:37.400
We shared a nice cup of tea.

37:37.400 --> 37:38.400
It was pleasant.

37:38.400 --> 37:39.400
You know, people often ask,

37:39.400 --> 37:41.400
can I just start at the latest episode

37:41.400 --> 37:42.400
of My Brother, My Brother and Me,

37:42.400 --> 37:44.400
and I say like, oh, you'll be so confused

37:44.400 --> 37:46.400
without all the backstory of the different things

37:46.400 --> 37:47.400
that inhabit Justin's body.

37:47.400 --> 37:48.400
But go on.

37:48.400 --> 37:49.400
The mythology.

37:49.400 --> 37:51.400
So, you know, last week I brought you

37:51.400 --> 37:56.400
the incredible story of all the different Halloween donuts.

37:56.400 --> 37:57.400
Yeah, Krispy Scream.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.400
From all, Krispy Scream.

37:59.400 --> 38:01.400
Oh, you scared me with that.

38:01.400 --> 38:02.400
Yeah, I know.

38:02.400 --> 38:03.400
I wasn't even ready for it,

38:03.400 --> 38:04.400
and you scared me.

38:04.400 --> 38:07.400
Well, I was ready to go back into my coffin

38:07.400 --> 38:09.400
and die for another year.

38:09.400 --> 38:11.400
In Justin's body?

38:11.400 --> 38:13.400
No, the spirit is in a coffin.

38:13.400 --> 38:14.400
Yeah.

38:14.400 --> 38:15.400
It comes out.

38:15.400 --> 38:17.400
It's like you don't know fucking anything, Travis.

38:17.400 --> 38:20.400
I'm just trying to catch it up for people at home.

38:20.400 --> 38:23.400
But then someone lays across my desk,

38:23.400 --> 38:25.400
that I have, which is my coffin.

38:25.400 --> 38:26.400
Okay.

38:26.400 --> 38:27.400
The top of my coffin, I call it.

38:27.400 --> 38:28.400
I like that.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.400
Do you like, do you live in like a tiny house?

38:30.400 --> 38:32.400
And you just like, you're very sort of efficient.

38:32.400 --> 38:34.400
Well, it's a coffin, which is a tiny house.

38:34.400 --> 38:35.400
Yes.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.400
Oh, so it's a sort of all-in-one living,

38:37.400 --> 38:39.400
or unliving experience.

38:39.400 --> 38:42.400
If you're trying to ask me if I poop in there,

38:42.400 --> 38:43.400
I'll never tell.

38:43.400 --> 38:44.400
I don't think we were.

38:44.400 --> 38:46.400
Sounds like you do, though.

38:46.400 --> 38:47.400
Like you definitely do.

38:47.400 --> 38:48.400
Okay.

38:48.400 --> 38:51.400
So, this is killing me.

38:51.400 --> 38:52.400
Let me get this off my chest.

38:52.400 --> 38:53.400
Yeah.

38:53.400 --> 38:54.400
Tim Horton.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.400
Do you know this man?

38:55.400 --> 38:56.400
Yeah.

38:56.400 --> 38:57.400
Canadian.

38:57.400 --> 38:58.400
Canadian.

38:58.400 --> 39:00.400
I think he's a hockey player.

39:00.400 --> 39:03.400
They do the name after him.

39:03.400 --> 39:09.400
They put out an announcement on October 19th,

39:09.400 --> 39:12.400
that they have a Halloween sprinkle donut.

39:12.400 --> 39:16.400
And I am so furious at these guys.

39:16.400 --> 39:19.400
This Halloween sprinkle donut.

39:19.400 --> 39:20.400
So festive.

39:20.400 --> 39:21.400
Yes.

39:21.400 --> 39:23.400
It's available October 27th.

39:23.400 --> 39:26.400
Begins October 27th.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.400
This Halloween sprinkle donut.

39:28.400 --> 39:29.400
And you don't like it?

39:29.400 --> 39:30.400
But listen to this.

39:30.400 --> 39:31.400
Listen to this.

39:31.400 --> 39:32.400
Okay.

39:32.400 --> 39:34.400
For your Halloween spirit.

39:34.400 --> 39:39.400
Tim Horton's U.S. restaurants are celebrating Halloween this year

39:39.400 --> 39:42.400
with all treats and no tricks.

39:42.400 --> 39:47.400
I would say it's mean trick to wait until October 27th.

39:47.400 --> 39:52.400
The Halloween sprinkle donut is a classic yeast ring donut

39:52.400 --> 40:01.400
dipped in chocolate fondant and topped with festive orange sprinkles.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.400
Oh my!

40:03.400 --> 40:04.400
Chilling!

40:04.400 --> 40:05.400
Yeah.

40:05.400 --> 40:07.400
What a festive thing you've done.

40:07.400 --> 40:11.400
It's chocolate with orange sprinkles?

40:11.400 --> 40:13.400
That's a little too much for me even.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.400
You're in the spirit now.

40:15.400 --> 40:16.400
Oh boy.

40:16.400 --> 40:19.400
And you say it's available for three whole days.

40:19.400 --> 40:21.400
Oh boy.

40:21.400 --> 40:27.400
Look at the Frankenstein over here really getting into it.

40:27.400 --> 40:33.400
This festive donut will make the perfect sweet to serve Halloween parties

40:33.400 --> 40:41.400
or delicious treat to enjoy while carving pumpkins and making costumes.

40:41.400 --> 40:46.400
This person definitely forgot about Halloween is what they're saying.

40:46.400 --> 40:48.400
They definitely forgot.

40:48.400 --> 40:49.400
Oh yeah.

40:49.400 --> 40:50.400
We've got one.

40:50.400 --> 40:52.400
Wait until you hear about it.

40:52.400 --> 40:56.400
It's available in a week and it's a chocolate donut with orange sprinkles.

40:56.400 --> 40:58.400
We've been working on this one for a while.

40:58.400 --> 40:59.400
Yeah.

40:59.400 --> 41:02.400
The boys at R&D, the D stands for death,

41:02.400 --> 41:05.400
they've really spooked you out with this one.

41:05.400 --> 41:07.400
It's a real crazy scary donut.

41:07.400 --> 41:09.400
You wouldn't believe it.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.400
They definitely forgot, Tim.

41:11.400 --> 41:14.400
Just say, put out an answer that says, oops.

41:14.400 --> 41:17.400
Oops.

41:17.400 --> 41:19.400
We didn't do Halloween this year.

41:19.400 --> 41:22.400
I hope you in these challenging times.

41:22.400 --> 41:25.400
We forgot to do this Halloween donut.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.400
Don't try.

41:27.400 --> 41:28.400
I'm furious.

41:28.400 --> 41:29.400
This is what I want to say.

41:29.400 --> 41:30.400
This is all.

41:30.400 --> 41:32.400
It's a terrible donut.

41:32.400 --> 41:36.400
But the good news is it's not available for very long.

41:36.400 --> 41:39.400
So anyway, I'm back to the beyond.

41:39.400 --> 41:41.400
Goodbye, boys.

41:41.400 --> 41:42.400
I'm not.

41:42.400 --> 41:43.400
Bye.

41:43.400 --> 41:44.400
How does he bring Justin back?

41:44.400 --> 41:46.400
Do you need me?

41:46.400 --> 41:47.400
I don't want to let them.

41:47.400 --> 41:50.400
You know, I don't just do donut stuff.

41:50.400 --> 41:51.400
I have a lot of great.

41:51.400 --> 41:53.400
You guys want to talk about Dune?

41:53.400 --> 41:54.400
It's coming out.

41:54.400 --> 41:56.400
Yeah, tell me your vampire thoughts about Dune.

41:56.400 --> 41:57.400
Yeah.

41:57.400 --> 42:01.400
I wanted to read the book, but who's got the time?

42:01.400 --> 42:03.400
Yeah, maybe you should go.

42:03.400 --> 42:05.400
My joke was good.

42:05.400 --> 42:08.400
It was pretty common mortal, you see.

42:08.400 --> 42:11.400
Oh, I didn't get it at first, but now I definitely do.

42:11.400 --> 42:12.400
Awesome.

42:12.400 --> 42:14.400
That's the kind of comedy I do.

42:14.400 --> 42:15.400
More thinkers.

42:15.400 --> 42:17.400
I've loved your stand up sets.

42:17.400 --> 42:18.400
Oh, OK.

42:18.400 --> 42:20.400
He's gone.

42:20.400 --> 42:21.400
Hey, I'm back.

42:21.400 --> 42:23.400
I'm getting used to it.

42:23.400 --> 42:24.400
You know what?

42:24.400 --> 42:27.400
Weirdly, Socrates, I get it.

42:27.400 --> 42:28.400
Yeah, sure.

42:28.400 --> 42:31.400
It's not too bad, honestly, being basically dead.

42:31.400 --> 42:32.400
It's not bad.

42:32.400 --> 42:33.400
Cool.

42:33.400 --> 42:34.400
Cool thing.

42:34.400 --> 42:35.400
I no longer fear it.

42:35.400 --> 42:36.400
How about another question?

42:36.400 --> 42:37.400
Hey, can I read a question?

42:37.400 --> 42:39.400
I never get to read a question.

42:39.400 --> 42:40.400
Hold on.

42:40.400 --> 42:43.400
Are you ready for this level of responsibility, Griffin?

42:43.400 --> 42:48.400
I mean, I read and make up bullshit questions throughout the show.

42:48.400 --> 42:50.400
Well, that's a little different, isn't it?

42:50.400 --> 42:52.400
Because now you're using real people's real words.

42:52.400 --> 42:53.400
Here it comes.

42:53.400 --> 42:54.400
OK.

42:54.400 --> 42:56.400
My cousin is getting married on Halloween this year.

42:56.400 --> 42:57.400
Small family wedding.

42:57.400 --> 42:58.400
Vaccine required.

42:58.400 --> 42:59.400
All chill.

42:59.400 --> 43:02.400
Thank you for including that because I was ready to judge.

43:02.400 --> 43:04.400
The invitation does not list any dress code,

43:04.400 --> 43:06.400
and I have no idea how much Halloween cheer

43:06.400 --> 43:07.400
I should bring to the event.

43:07.400 --> 43:09.400
The couple is very nerdy into board games,

43:09.400 --> 43:10.400
D&D, video games, et cetera,

43:10.400 --> 43:14.400
but they're not specifically Halloween nerdy.

43:14.400 --> 43:17.400
They chose Halloween because my cousin's birthday is on April Fool's Day,

43:17.400 --> 43:21.400
so they thought it'd be cool if their anniversary was also on a pseudo holiday.

43:21.400 --> 43:24.400
They're even getting married on a classy beach.

43:24.400 --> 43:27.400
Surely I don't just wear a normal dress to a Halloween wedding,

43:27.400 --> 43:30.400
but a costume also has to be out of the question, right?

43:30.400 --> 43:33.400
Can I get away with a fancy witch's hat, a cape, a broom?

43:33.400 --> 43:36.400
From Confounded in California.

43:36.400 --> 43:38.400
This one is tough.

43:38.400 --> 43:41.400
I actually have no, absolutely no idea.

43:41.400 --> 43:46.400
I don't know anything about weddings or Halloween or clothes.

43:46.400 --> 43:48.400
Oh, you know who I could call?

43:48.400 --> 43:49.400
Who?

43:49.400 --> 43:51.400
Mr. Halloween himself.

43:51.400 --> 43:55.400
The king of horror, as I call him.

43:55.400 --> 43:57.400
The king of podcasting horror.

43:57.400 --> 43:59.400
The Duke of Doom.

43:59.400 --> 44:00.400
The Duke of Doom.

44:00.400 --> 44:03.400
The Sultan of scares.

44:03.400 --> 44:05.400
And SWAT.

44:05.400 --> 44:06.400
Five more.

44:06.400 --> 44:08.400
Five more of them, please.

44:08.400 --> 44:09.400
Joseph Fink.

44:09.400 --> 44:11.400
He's one of the Nightfall guys.

44:11.400 --> 44:14.400
They've got a whole writers' room over there, but he's one of them.

44:14.400 --> 44:15.400
Hold on.

44:15.400 --> 44:18.400
I have a yellow book of fellow New York Times bestselling authors.

44:18.400 --> 44:21.400
Let me look at this.

44:21.400 --> 44:24.400
Oh, no, that's Hank Green.

44:24.400 --> 44:27.400
If you can't find him, let's just do Dan Brown.

44:27.400 --> 44:28.400
Dan.

44:28.400 --> 44:29.400
No, no, here he is.

44:29.400 --> 44:30.400
Here he is.

44:30.400 --> 44:31.400
Hold on.

44:31.400 --> 44:32.400
I'll call him.

44:32.400 --> 44:33.400
Beep, boop, beep, boop, boop, boop, beep.

44:33.400 --> 44:36.400
This is Mr. Halloween, the king of horror podcasting.

44:36.400 --> 44:37.400
Oh, hey, Joseph.

44:37.400 --> 44:40.400
Hey, Joseph.

44:40.400 --> 44:42.400
Justin McElroy.

44:42.400 --> 44:46.400
My brothers and I do a different podcast.

44:46.400 --> 44:47.400
My brother, my brother, and me.

44:47.400 --> 44:48.400
I don't know if you've...

44:48.400 --> 44:50.400
We did PodCon together.

44:50.400 --> 44:51.400
We did PodCon.

44:51.400 --> 44:53.400
It's like a not scary...

44:53.400 --> 44:54.400
I know this is for people.

44:54.400 --> 44:55.400
Oh, not sure.

44:55.400 --> 44:56.400
Not scary podcasting also exists.

44:56.400 --> 44:59.400
Yeah, not all podcasts are supposed to be scary ghosty tales.

44:59.400 --> 45:01.400
Ours is for babies.

45:01.400 --> 45:02.400
Yeah.

45:02.400 --> 45:03.400
Exactly.

45:03.400 --> 45:07.400
So you've been kind of the king of horror for years now.

45:07.400 --> 45:08.400
What would you...

45:08.400 --> 45:14.400
We do advice on our show and we had someone ask us what they would wear to a Halloween

45:14.400 --> 45:21.400
wedding and we were curious what would be an appropriately ghoulish ensemble for that

45:21.400 --> 45:22.400
kind of thing.

45:22.400 --> 45:27.400
Yeah, I mean, kind of through the ether, I heard the question and I just want to...

45:27.400 --> 45:31.400
That must be so distracting, you living your daily life, hearing all podcast questions.

45:31.400 --> 45:36.400
Like a real Bruce Almighty, but for podcast bullshit.

45:36.400 --> 45:39.400
I just want to first address pseudo-holiday.

45:39.400 --> 45:40.400
Thank you.

45:40.400 --> 45:41.400
Pseudo-holiday?

45:41.400 --> 45:42.400
Yeah.

45:42.400 --> 45:43.400
Like it's Halloween.

45:43.400 --> 45:44.400
This isn't...

45:44.400 --> 45:52.960
I mean, April Fool's Day I get, but like respect Halloween.

45:52.960 --> 45:57.160
I do understand because as far as I know, not a federal holiday.

45:57.160 --> 46:01.280
You don't get Halloween off from your job.

46:01.280 --> 46:04.000
It's one of the big three.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
It's a huge holiday.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
It's one of the big ones.

46:06.000 --> 46:09.280
I will tell you as a Jew that there are a lot of important holidays you do not get off

46:09.280 --> 46:10.280
from the federal government.

46:10.280 --> 46:11.280
This is fair.

46:11.280 --> 46:12.880
It's an excellent point.

46:12.880 --> 46:18.040
And you know, I said that you don't technically get off work, but nothing gets done on Halloween

46:18.040 --> 46:20.040
in a workplace, right?

46:20.040 --> 46:24.840
Everybody's eating candy and wearing costumes and doing fun games, I assume.

46:24.840 --> 46:25.840
I don't know.

46:25.840 --> 46:31.200
On a day when your sister could turn into a bat and gremlins can mess up all your cassettes,

46:31.200 --> 46:33.160
how are you supposed to get any work done?

46:33.160 --> 46:34.160
It's too scary.

46:34.160 --> 46:35.160
Yeah.

46:35.160 --> 46:36.160
Anything could happen.

46:36.160 --> 46:37.160
Way too scary.

46:37.160 --> 46:39.740
To address the question though, I mean, I feel like you don't actually have to do that.

46:39.740 --> 46:40.740
Don't feel like...

46:40.740 --> 46:41.740
We rarely do.

46:41.740 --> 46:45.440
But if you want to take a swing at it for the novelty, please go ahead.

46:45.440 --> 46:49.880
Well, they found the answer, I think themselves, which is an elegant witch's hat.

46:49.880 --> 46:50.880
Sounds perfect.

46:50.880 --> 46:53.320
I mean, that's perfect for most occasions.

46:53.320 --> 46:54.320
This is true.

46:54.320 --> 46:59.960
What if you go indoors though, what if there's an indoors portion of the wedding, you have

46:59.960 --> 47:02.480
to take it off, then you just have matted witch hat hair.

47:02.480 --> 47:04.920
Well, you have a smaller hat underneath.

47:04.920 --> 47:06.600
Okay, okay.

47:06.600 --> 47:07.600
Or an owl.

47:07.600 --> 47:09.120
There you go.

47:09.120 --> 47:11.040
No one's noticing your hair at that point.

47:11.040 --> 47:12.040
Yeah.

47:12.040 --> 47:13.520
And if they do, they'll blame it on the owl.

47:13.520 --> 47:14.520
Yeah.

47:14.520 --> 47:15.520
Sorry about my hair, guys.

47:15.520 --> 47:18.600
I'm just picturing the national anthem happens and someone has to take off their elegant

47:18.600 --> 47:20.760
witch's hat and hold it in their chest.

47:20.760 --> 47:23.160
You know Disney bounding where people dress...

47:23.160 --> 47:27.720
You're not allowed to wear costumes to the parks, so people will dress up in outfits

47:27.720 --> 47:30.620
inspired by characters that they...

47:30.620 --> 47:32.040
You are reading my mind.

47:32.040 --> 47:38.200
So like for Winnie the Pooh, you would wear like a red t-shirt and like...

47:38.200 --> 47:39.200
And no pants.

47:39.200 --> 47:40.200
No pants.

47:40.200 --> 47:41.200
Sort of like...

47:41.200 --> 47:42.200
It's not a costume, it's just like...

47:42.200 --> 47:43.200
Yeah.

47:43.200 --> 47:47.360
So for this, I think you'd want to do like Halloween bounding, where it's like doffing

47:47.360 --> 47:48.960
your cap to Frankenstein.

47:48.960 --> 47:49.960
You know what I mean?

47:49.960 --> 47:53.640
Like an elegant bolt on your, two elegant bolts on your neck.

47:53.640 --> 47:59.280
Listen, I'm just going to say two words that you could Halloween bound, Sanderson sisters.

47:59.280 --> 48:01.880
Right there, little hocus pocus action.

48:01.880 --> 48:07.760
Those dresses could easily, easily translate to an elegant...

48:07.760 --> 48:11.320
Now it is a beach wedding, so maybe not an elegant ball gown, which is what I was going

48:11.320 --> 48:12.320
to say.

48:12.320 --> 48:13.320
This is what fucks me up.

48:13.320 --> 48:17.960
That's the least terrifying environment, unless you are afraid of sea creatures, as I am,

48:17.960 --> 48:21.960
but I doubt that there's going to be a swimming portion of the wedding, right?

48:21.960 --> 48:25.680
So like, it's not going to be, it's tonally strange.

48:25.680 --> 48:26.680
Yes.

48:26.680 --> 48:33.680
Could you, could you, could you Halloween bound like a mermaid or a shark or a shark

48:33.680 --> 48:34.680
victim?

48:34.680 --> 48:35.680
The creature from the Black Lagoon.

48:35.680 --> 48:36.680
Yes.

48:36.680 --> 48:37.680
There you go.

48:37.680 --> 48:38.680
Good idea.

48:38.680 --> 48:40.240
Something very aquatic.

48:40.240 --> 48:43.880
Maybe just dress as a shell and you're laying on the beach the whole time.

48:43.880 --> 48:47.440
They're like, I can't believe that, you know, Sandy didn't make it.

48:47.440 --> 48:48.440
And then boom, you pop up.

48:48.440 --> 48:49.440
Sorry.

48:49.440 --> 48:50.440
Wait, wait, wait.

48:50.440 --> 48:51.440
Yeah, I know.

48:51.440 --> 48:54.800
Is that because you were thinking beach, so Sandy is the name you got too?

48:54.800 --> 48:55.800
Yeah.

48:55.800 --> 48:56.800
Yeah, it is, Justin.

48:56.800 --> 48:57.800
What's wrong with that?

48:57.800 --> 48:58.800
It is.

48:58.800 --> 48:59.800
Thank you.

48:59.800 --> 49:00.800
Okay.

49:00.800 --> 49:01.800
And then the shell pops up, but it's you.

49:01.800 --> 49:02.800
I could have said Shelly.

49:02.800 --> 49:03.800
Damn it.

49:03.800 --> 49:06.000
If you have a wedding on Halloween, I feel like you have to address that.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
Yes.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
In the invitations.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.960
You've been set up to fail here.

49:09.960 --> 49:14.600
You should have mentioned on that invitations, look, we know what day this is.

49:14.600 --> 49:17.160
Do not show up dressed up like a big Pikachu.

49:17.160 --> 49:18.160
That's fucked up.

49:18.160 --> 49:27.440
I think it, I think it is morally indefensible to have a wedding on a day that is most well

49:27.440 --> 49:33.360
known here in the US as a day that one dresses in costume and to say, I expect you to be

49:33.360 --> 49:35.400
there and not in costume.

49:35.400 --> 49:36.400
Right?

49:36.400 --> 49:38.520
That feel, then why did you do it?

49:38.520 --> 49:43.440
Like unless you just decided to get married two weeks ago, right?

49:43.440 --> 49:46.720
And then otherwise you knew you planned it on Halloween.

49:46.720 --> 49:48.280
Just do it on Thanksgiving or something.

49:48.280 --> 49:49.560
No, it's a weird thing.

49:49.560 --> 49:50.560
Yeah.

49:50.560 --> 49:51.560
That's sort of the premise of the show.

49:51.560 --> 49:52.560
Oh, right.

49:52.560 --> 49:53.560
Here's where I'm at.

49:53.560 --> 49:56.560
It's like, fellows, we've all been married.

49:56.560 --> 49:57.560
Yeah.

49:57.560 --> 49:58.560
It's a day of joy.

49:58.560 --> 50:00.000
It's a, it's a very happy day.

50:00.000 --> 50:05.560
So like, you know, if someone shows up dressed as a giant Pikachu, I'm, I'm fine with that.

50:05.560 --> 50:07.120
That's an expression of joy.

50:07.120 --> 50:11.880
Like what am I going to be upset about someone doing something they love on this joyful day?

50:11.880 --> 50:16.640
Well, I guess the real question, Joseph, is would you let them into the pictures?

50:16.640 --> 50:20.280
That is a fucking actually fantastic question.

50:20.280 --> 50:26.860
My friend Eric came to our wedding and this was during a period where he had, I would

50:26.860 --> 50:32.920
say the most perverted mustache any human being has ever grown on his face.

50:32.920 --> 50:35.920
And this was for, he had this mustache for two months.

50:35.920 --> 50:39.320
So it was not like iconic Eric pervert mustache.

50:39.320 --> 50:45.440
It was like something he grew on a dare and then is in every single one of the like crowd

50:45.440 --> 50:48.400
shots of the wedding photos.

50:48.400 --> 50:53.480
And it's like, it's hard not to, when you look at, oh, there's my nanny and she's, she's

50:53.480 --> 50:54.760
talking to our friends.

50:54.760 --> 50:55.760
That's so, ah fuck.

50:55.760 --> 51:00.680
Look at, look at, look at, there he is trying to, he's going to steal my grandma with that

51:00.680 --> 51:01.680
mustache.

51:01.680 --> 51:06.020
Well, this is especially, this occurs to me now, especially if question asker, you decide

51:06.020 --> 51:10.760
to go with a very topical costume and you're like, get it, I'm from squid game or whatever.

51:10.760 --> 51:15.400
And then like 20 years from now, this person's kids are like looking at the photos and like

51:15.400 --> 51:17.040
this is so beautiful.

51:17.040 --> 51:18.600
Are you, what, what is that?

51:18.600 --> 51:21.080
And you're like, oh, it was from, oh, what was that?

51:21.080 --> 51:25.600
Uh, Joseph, what's your favorite character from your own podcast to cosplay as?

51:25.600 --> 51:26.600
Good question.

51:26.600 --> 51:31.280
Um, I like, uh, Cecil because no one knows what he looks like.

51:31.280 --> 51:35.400
So I am always cosplaying as Cecil at all times.

51:35.400 --> 51:36.960
It's possible that all of us are.

51:36.960 --> 51:37.960
Yeah.

51:37.960 --> 51:38.960
Whoa.

51:38.960 --> 51:39.960
Whoa.

51:39.960 --> 51:40.960
Guys.

51:40.960 --> 51:41.960
I got it.

51:41.960 --> 51:42.960
I got it.

51:42.960 --> 51:43.960
I got it.

51:43.960 --> 51:44.960
All right.

51:44.960 --> 51:48.400
So, uh, Mamoru Chiba, tuxedo mask.

51:48.400 --> 51:50.760
Oh yeah.

51:50.760 --> 51:52.800
Tuxedo mask of sailor moon fame.

51:52.800 --> 51:54.800
You go as tuxedo mask.

51:54.800 --> 51:58.520
You arrive, elegant cape, tuxedo.

51:58.520 --> 51:59.760
Everyone's loving it.

51:59.760 --> 52:00.760
Yes.

52:00.760 --> 52:02.880
White mask in your pocket.

52:02.880 --> 52:06.560
And then you get there and you check the vibe.

52:06.560 --> 52:08.600
You have the rose in the back pocket.

52:08.600 --> 52:17.600
You're ready to dress out if the situation is one where tuxedo mask would be appropriate.

52:17.600 --> 52:23.760
If not, you leave the mask in your pocket and you're just someone in a very elegant

52:23.760 --> 52:24.760
tuxedo.

52:24.760 --> 52:25.760
Right.

52:25.760 --> 52:26.760
Sure.

52:26.760 --> 52:31.600
What I like about that is it addresses my concern, which is the inverse, uh, sort of

52:31.600 --> 52:37.680
fear, which is that you show up in your, you know, Sunday best, but then you show up and

52:37.680 --> 52:41.400
everybody's squid game and Pikachu.

52:41.400 --> 52:44.800
And you're like, shit, I didn't realize we were having fun with this one because it's

52:44.800 --> 52:45.800
a wedding.

52:45.800 --> 52:46.800
Oh, okay.

52:46.800 --> 52:51.000
Wait, this isn't an answer for the question asker, but if you are a wedding thrower and

52:51.000 --> 52:56.240
you're ever in this exact situation, instead of one side for one participant and one side

52:56.240 --> 53:01.880
for the other, you have a side of the audience for costumes and a side of the audience for

53:01.880 --> 53:03.640
squares.

53:03.640 --> 53:05.880
That's good.

53:05.880 --> 53:10.000
And then you get two photographers, one angling from the square side.

53:10.000 --> 53:16.400
Oh, and you, oh, the two participants, you're wearing half costume, half wedding clothes

53:16.400 --> 53:20.160
so that when they take pictures from this side, it's all wedding baby.

53:20.160 --> 53:23.200
And then pictures from this side, all spooky Halloween fun.

53:23.200 --> 53:25.840
Hey Joseph, do you got a new book coming out?

53:25.840 --> 53:26.840
I feel like you helped this person.

53:26.840 --> 53:27.840
You helped this person.

53:27.840 --> 53:30.280
Now, if you got a new book coming out.

53:30.280 --> 53:31.280
It's a good question.

53:31.280 --> 53:32.280
I do.

53:32.280 --> 53:33.280
You often do.

53:33.280 --> 53:34.280
Okay.

53:34.280 --> 53:35.280
Thank you.

53:35.280 --> 53:36.280
Thank you.

53:36.280 --> 53:37.280
Thank you, Joseph.

53:37.280 --> 53:38.280
And thank you for coming on.

53:38.280 --> 53:39.280
So glad.

53:39.280 --> 53:40.280
No way.

53:40.280 --> 53:41.360
I need to know the title of it so that I can sleep tonight.

53:41.360 --> 53:43.160
Yeah, that makes sense.

53:43.160 --> 53:45.680
It's called the Halloween moon, coincidentally.

53:45.680 --> 53:51.160
And it's a middle grade novel about Halloween and the experience of trick or treating.

53:51.160 --> 53:55.880
And then also the experience of when Halloween night never ends and it just keeps going and

53:55.880 --> 54:00.120
going and time gets stuck and you have to save the day because you're stuck in Halloween

54:00.120 --> 54:01.220
forever.

54:01.220 --> 54:02.220
It's out now.

54:02.220 --> 54:03.800
It's a great, great time to read it.

54:03.800 --> 54:08.080
I mean, it's, it's for ages 10 and up, but I think adult fans who like the spooky and

54:08.080 --> 54:10.680
maybe like Welcome to Nightville will really enjoy it too.

54:10.680 --> 54:11.680
Who read the audio book?

54:11.680 --> 54:12.680
I see.

54:12.680 --> 54:18.320
Oh, Kevin R. Free, who plays Kevin on Welcome to Nightville and is just a truly wonderful

54:18.320 --> 54:19.320
performer.

54:19.320 --> 54:20.320
Oh, excellent.

54:20.320 --> 54:21.560
That sounds very good.

54:21.560 --> 54:25.760
Is this a follow up to Mr. Bone Clown's scarifying adventure?

54:25.760 --> 54:28.280
Your last, your last book?

54:28.280 --> 54:30.320
I think of it more as a spiritual sequel.

54:30.320 --> 54:31.320
Yeah.

54:31.320 --> 54:34.040
You're saying there's ghosts in it.

54:34.040 --> 54:40.480
Because the Mr. Bone Clown series, like usually you get his name in the title, so I was confused

54:40.480 --> 54:42.120
about this one.

54:42.120 --> 54:45.840
I really, I felt like stretching myself this time trying something new.

54:45.840 --> 54:49.760
Joseph, are you getting ready to pull them all together with references from one book

54:49.760 --> 54:54.680
appearing in the other series until eventually you, the author, appear in one and like reveal

54:54.680 --> 54:58.680
that it's all been connected and springing forth from your mind?

54:58.680 --> 54:59.680
Yes.

54:59.680 --> 55:02.200
It's a, it's the shared Thinkiverse.

55:02.200 --> 55:10.400
Now I, yeah, Joseph, if you, you, you wrote, if I'm, if I can, let me check my, yeah, this

55:10.400 --> 55:17.160
is 37 Scare Gobblers books for kids and you're finally departing from the Scare Gobblers

55:17.160 --> 55:18.480
series.

55:18.480 --> 55:24.560
Why is this, I guess, why is the Halloween moon available now, not in the Scare Gobblers

55:24.560 --> 55:25.560
franchise?

55:25.560 --> 55:30.200
In answer to your question, I'm just going to tell you my favorite anecdote I ever heard

55:30.200 --> 55:32.480
from the Goosebumps guy.

55:32.480 --> 55:33.880
I was listening to an interview with R.L.

55:33.880 --> 55:39.240
Stein in which he was talking about a fan letter he got after having written, I think,

55:39.240 --> 55:48.320
over 200 books and the fan letter said, I've read all of your books and they're all terrible.

55:48.320 --> 55:50.080
That's commitment to the bit, isn't it?

55:50.080 --> 55:51.080
You think R.L.

55:51.080 --> 55:52.080
Stein's one guy?

55:52.080 --> 55:53.080
Whoa.

55:53.080 --> 55:54.760
Oh, you think he's like a Shakespeare thing?

55:54.760 --> 55:55.760
That Shakespeare wrote them?

55:55.760 --> 55:56.760
Yeah.

55:56.760 --> 55:57.760
Shakespeare wrote.

55:57.760 --> 55:58.760
Shakespeare wrote Goosebumps.

55:58.760 --> 56:02.720
Hey, the Halloween moon is good.

56:02.720 --> 56:04.400
I love all of your books, Joseph.

56:04.400 --> 56:09.900
You know that I, after I read one of your books, I like to tell you that I liked it

56:09.900 --> 56:13.960
and this, I'm sure will be no exception for all of our listeners.

56:13.960 --> 56:14.960
They're going to love it.

56:14.960 --> 56:15.960
You know what I love?

56:15.960 --> 56:20.000
Joseph wrote a book called The First 10 Years with his wife, Meg Bashwiner, and that is

56:20.000 --> 56:21.860
a very good book as well.

56:21.860 --> 56:26.920
It's both of them are calling their relationship independently and how those stories overlap

56:26.920 --> 56:30.200
is very touching and lovely and I love that book too.

56:30.200 --> 56:36.240
So if you read The Halloween Moon and you want something exactly like it, check out

56:36.240 --> 56:37.520
that book as well.

56:37.520 --> 56:38.960
Thank you so much, guys.

56:38.960 --> 56:41.000
And Night Vale, are you guys still doing that?

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
I feel like-

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
Yeah.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.280
We're about to hit our 10 year anniversary.

56:45.280 --> 56:50.240
Yeah, we're in that club where it's like, we very justifiably, if people hear about

56:50.240 --> 56:54.880
either of our podcasts, I think, are you guys still doing that as a completely legitimate

56:54.880 --> 56:57.160
response to my brother, me and Night Vale?

56:57.160 --> 57:02.800
A tweet I get literally weekly, if not daily is, wait, Night Vale is still happening?

57:02.800 --> 57:03.800
It's better than ever.

57:03.800 --> 57:06.200
Now's the best time to hop on board, wouldn't you agree?

57:06.200 --> 57:08.240
What do you tell people if they're like, where do I start?

57:08.240 --> 57:12.240
Because you don't want to go back to, I mean, I guess you have to go back to the beginning.

57:12.240 --> 57:13.240
Do y'all ever do that?

57:13.240 --> 57:17.760
Like, do you ever do like Marvel does and do like a universe reset?

57:17.760 --> 57:21.760
Our argument is always you can start wherever because, yes, it's confusing if you start

57:21.760 --> 57:26.160
at episode 170, but it's also confusing if you start at episode one.

57:26.160 --> 57:27.200
You'll get it eventually.

57:27.200 --> 57:28.320
Just start where you want.

57:28.320 --> 57:34.560
I like to start in the middle and listen out, so like listen to one next and one before

57:34.560 --> 57:40.360
and then keep going like that and then back in until the universe collapses in on itself.

57:40.360 --> 57:41.360
That's cool.

57:41.360 --> 57:42.360
Yeah.

57:42.360 --> 57:43.360
Yeah.

57:43.360 --> 57:46.160
Joseph, this has always been a treat.

57:46.160 --> 57:52.360
Listen to Joseph's work and read Joseph's work and support him because he's a real solid

57:52.360 --> 57:53.360
person.

57:53.360 --> 57:54.360
Joseph, can I tell you something?

57:54.360 --> 57:58.200
I've never told you before and we've known each other for years now, but I didn't want

57:58.200 --> 58:00.200
to miss this opportunity to tell you.

58:00.200 --> 58:05.480
When I started listening to Night Vale for a long, long time, I thought Joseph Fink was

58:05.480 --> 58:10.680
a character that you created to play at the beginning of every episode introducing it.

58:10.680 --> 58:14.440
I did not realize you were a real person for many years.

58:14.440 --> 58:19.720
A lot of people did because we did this fun joking thing where we had multiple people

58:19.720 --> 58:24.440
pretend to be like, hi, I'm Joseph Fink and I just thought it would be a fun way to get

58:24.440 --> 58:30.200
people to listen to the ads and then it turned into people thinking I'm fictional.

58:30.200 --> 58:37.920
Joseph Fink is his SAG name because there already was a Joey Funk, which is his real

58:37.920 --> 58:38.920
name.

58:38.920 --> 58:39.920
Yeah.

58:39.920 --> 58:43.280
And then Joey Funk changed to Bruno Mars, which is very frustrating.

58:43.280 --> 58:46.760
Because you could have just stayed Joey Funk.

58:46.760 --> 58:51.200
And the original Joseph Fink had to change his name to Finkasaurus Rex, but all of his

58:51.200 --> 58:53.160
albums are available on Spotify now.

58:53.160 --> 58:54.760
So yeah, get there.

58:54.760 --> 58:57.920
Hey Joseph, thanks for everything.

58:57.920 --> 58:59.800
Thanks for being here and thanks for the help.

58:59.800 --> 59:01.120
Thank you so much for having me.

59:01.120 --> 59:02.120
This was fun.

59:02.120 --> 59:06.240
Boy, can you take this was fun just one more time, but really put a little bit more emotion

59:06.240 --> 59:07.240
behind it.

59:07.240 --> 59:13.160
I could feel, if you could just give me like one more punch up of that.

59:13.160 --> 59:15.040
Thanks so much for having me.

59:15.040 --> 59:16.040
This was fun.

59:16.040 --> 59:17.040
Much better.

59:17.040 --> 59:18.040
Much better.

59:18.040 --> 59:19.040
Maniacal.

59:19.040 --> 59:28.920
Thank you so much to Joseph Fink, his new book, The Halloween Moon is available now

59:28.920 --> 59:30.160
along with all of his other books.

59:30.160 --> 59:33.880
And if you don't listen to Welcome to Night Vale, you really actually should.

59:33.880 --> 59:35.880
What are you even doing?

59:35.880 --> 59:38.360
It's good and funny and good.

59:38.360 --> 59:41.020
We have an Adventure Zone live show.

It feels like Montaigne made the music video for the three of us to enjoy.

It feels like a DM music video and it's so fucking good.

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.800
It's been stuck in my head all day.

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:32.800

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:51.080

This one was sent in by Alf.

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:13.760
I want you guys to know that sometimes I just start, I say like a phonetic sound and then

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:17.480
just like try to build it in real time.

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:19.800
No one's surprised by that revelation.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:20.800
Oh, okay.

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:21.800
Cool, cool, cool.

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:22.800
Yeah.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:29.080
So you can hear, you can actually hear your loading screen in your brain as you do it.

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.360
So yeah.

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.360
So Alf sent this in.

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:32.360
Thanks, Alf.

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:46.720
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user den, denet, denes, denesquade, which is wild.

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:51.920
It's wild that it like specifically says here to say denesquade.

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.840
So we've all been saying it wrong all these years.

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:55.640
We've all been wrong.

01:03:55.640 --> 01:04:07.480
And denesquade says, denesquade asks, I'm having trouble reading because I'm translating

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.480
it from Sanskrit.

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:09.480
Oh really?

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:10.480
Yeah.

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:15.520
I didn't even know Yahoo allowed you to do Sanskrit.

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:28.000
Denesquade asks, does anyone have tickets for sale for the big New Year's Eve Hoobastank

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
concert?

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:37.720
I'm trying to get out there, but I don't have as much sway as I used to.

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:39.560
Thank you.

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:40.560
