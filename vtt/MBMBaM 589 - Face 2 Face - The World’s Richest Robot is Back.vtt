00:00.000 --> 00:03.020
The McElroy brothers are not experts,

00:04.760 --> 00:08.040
and their advice should never be followed.

00:08.040 --> 00:11.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert,

00:12.240 --> 00:16.200
but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:17.240 --> 00:18.800
Hey, it's my gig, okay?

00:20.720 --> 00:23.000
It's all I have.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.240
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only,

00:28.240 --> 00:31.640
so the babies out there will know how cool they are

00:31.640 --> 00:33.520
for listening.

00:33.520 --> 00:36.720
What's up, you cool baby?

00:36.720 --> 00:41.720
It feels like life, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

00:45.880 --> 00:50.880
My life, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

00:51.920 --> 00:56.920
This is true, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

00:56.920 --> 00:59.920
My life, oh, it's better with you.

01:11.320 --> 01:12.280
Let me tell you something,

01:12.280 --> 01:15.120
if you've never experienced that before,

01:16.000 --> 01:18.720
and then you go two years without it,

01:18.720 --> 01:20.320
oh, it starts to hurt.

01:20.320 --> 01:21.160
Oh, boy.

01:21.160 --> 01:23.320
Oh, boy, it starts to hurt, you start to crave it.

01:23.320 --> 01:25.040
Hello, and welcome, my brother, my brother,

01:25.040 --> 01:27.440
me an advice show for the modern era.

01:32.080 --> 01:34.320
They did have to recast me during the break,

01:34.320 --> 01:39.240
but I'll be playing Justin McElroy, the oldest brother.

01:39.240 --> 01:42.240
Sorry, McElroy, it says here, McElroy.

01:42.240 --> 01:45.160
I'll be playing Travis, big dog.

01:47.160 --> 01:48.000
McElroy.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't think so, folks.

01:56.760 --> 01:59.560
How many more live shows can we pack into 2021

01:59.560 --> 02:01.040
before that dies off?

02:01.960 --> 02:04.040
I just checked, is it?

02:04.040 --> 02:06.760
None, okay, apparently it's just this one.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.280
And I'm Griffin McElroy.

02:10.280 --> 02:15.280
And I also want to say a special thanks

02:19.960 --> 02:23.160
to the old prospector who came and introduced us

02:23.160 --> 02:24.120
at the start of the show.

02:24.120 --> 02:25.880
Thank you, old prospector.

02:25.880 --> 02:30.880
Yeah, that's funny, I guess.

02:32.560 --> 02:34.600
Griff, what's the matter, buddy?

02:34.600 --> 02:35.640
What's wrong, bud?

02:35.640 --> 02:36.720
You should be happy we're back doing live shows.

02:36.720 --> 02:38.080
Yeah, I was back doing shows.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.840
Oh, yeah, I'm stoked, I'm stoked, everyone.

02:42.000 --> 02:42.840
Did something happen?

02:42.840 --> 02:43.680
Yeah, what's up?

02:46.440 --> 02:47.280
Hold on, let me try, let me try again.

02:47.280 --> 02:49.640
This is sincere, can we get a second read?

02:49.640 --> 02:51.640
Yeah, I'll take it, we'll get this in post.

02:51.640 --> 02:52.680
Okay, we'll get it clean.

02:52.680 --> 02:53.960
Can we get it clean, please, everyone?

02:53.960 --> 02:56.640
Hey, what's, what's up?

02:58.800 --> 03:00.560
It's fine, let's just do this, we can do it.

03:00.560 --> 03:03.080
No, hey, this is a labor, Griffin.

03:03.080 --> 03:04.400
Clearly something's up.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.760
Do you need to talk in private?

03:06.760 --> 03:08.080
Yeah.

03:10.280 --> 03:12.280
John Cena whipped your ass?

03:14.400 --> 03:15.920
Sorry, oh, I forgot the mics were on.

03:15.920 --> 03:17.560
I'm so sorry, Griffin.

03:17.560 --> 03:20.600
What, wait, wait, Griffin, is he telling the truth?

03:20.600 --> 03:22.480
Or is this some twisted game of telephone?

03:22.480 --> 03:23.640
Certainly.

03:23.640 --> 03:24.480
No.

03:24.480 --> 03:26.720
TV and films John Cena didn't whip your ass?

03:26.720 --> 03:29.720
Not children's prank show host John Cena.

03:32.240 --> 03:34.200
It's fine, it was this afternoon

03:34.200 --> 03:36.520
and I'm doing much better now.

03:36.520 --> 03:37.440
What happened?

03:38.920 --> 03:39.760
Well.

03:41.880 --> 03:44.520
Tell me the true story about John Cena whipped your ass.

03:44.520 --> 03:45.520
Up and down.

03:47.400 --> 03:48.960
Oh, up and down, you didn't say.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.360
Not side to side?

03:51.360 --> 03:53.560
No, he got me there too, he got me there too.

03:55.760 --> 03:56.600
Poor thing.

03:56.600 --> 04:01.080
It was just like, it really wasn't a big deal,

04:01.080 --> 04:04.720
but it was right after lunch and I was going

04:04.720 --> 04:06.840
to the restroom.

04:06.840 --> 04:09.640
You just finished your Crestless PB&J.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.480
Yeah, and it was just after lunch

04:11.480 --> 04:14.560
and you know, for the bathroom, that's like rush hour.

04:14.560 --> 04:15.680
Yeah.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.920
And so I just like showed up to a bathroom

04:17.920 --> 04:19.600
and there was only one stall open,

04:19.600 --> 04:22.600
but John Cena kind of walked in there at the same time.

04:23.480 --> 04:24.440
Yeah.

04:24.440 --> 04:28.680
And he was like, excuse me, excuse me.

04:30.160 --> 04:32.400
I'm glad you took a second run at that.

04:32.400 --> 04:33.240
Excuse me.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.760
Much more Cena-esque.

04:34.760 --> 04:37.080
No, you guys can joke about this.

04:38.720 --> 04:43.720
But I was like, oh hey, great stuff that you do.

04:43.720 --> 04:45.040
I'll be real quick.

04:46.960 --> 04:50.640
And then he started, like what surprised me

04:50.640 --> 04:52.960
was how quickly he started just yelling.

04:55.640 --> 04:56.920
He was like, I should go first,

04:56.920 --> 04:58.920
I was the one who did wrestling.

04:58.920 --> 05:02.720
And then I was like, I understand that,

05:02.720 --> 05:03.760
but I'm actually here with,

05:03.760 --> 05:07.240
but he already was whipping my ass at that point.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.120
Hey, Griffin, I'm sorry.

05:09.120 --> 05:11.000
Yeah, no, go ahead and ask.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.200
Whatever you want to know.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.840
Did the ass whipping ramp up slowly?

05:14.840 --> 05:16.920
No, it was like, it was so,

05:18.200 --> 05:21.080
everything about this was so fast.

05:22.200 --> 05:25.560
He like, before I knew it,

05:25.560 --> 05:29.400
and I was already like, oh yeah, okay, you can.

05:29.400 --> 05:32.160
And like a few more stalls opened up,

05:32.160 --> 05:35.920
but he was like pretty focused in on that point.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.240
Yeah.

05:37.240 --> 05:39.000
That's kind of his whole thing.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.640
Yeah, no, he has sort of explosive strength.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.800
And then he was like, he was like picking me up

05:46.800 --> 05:49.600
and he was like trying to put me in the sink.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.120
And he was like,

05:51.120 --> 05:52.280
Like head first, like a swirly?

05:52.280 --> 05:54.120
No, like he was sitting me in it.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.280
And then he was like pushing me down

05:56.280 --> 05:59.360
and he was like, I'm gonna make you go in the sink hole.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.360
Yeah.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.840
And you're sure it was John Cena?

06:01.840 --> 06:03.400
It was him, for sure.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.800
You weren't mistaking it with another large man?

06:08.080 --> 06:10.520
We are never going to be invited

06:10.520 --> 06:12.840
to this convention again.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.960
100%.

06:14.960 --> 06:15.800
We've done three.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.520
I know John Cena just stood up in the crowd and walked out.

06:18.520 --> 06:19.680
John, it was a joke.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.760
We've done three events today.

06:21.760 --> 06:24.320
And in every one, the majority of discussion

06:24.320 --> 06:26.200
has been about John Cena.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.040
It's only been able to talk about all day.

06:28.040 --> 06:30.680
Before he whipped my ass inside and out

06:30.680 --> 06:32.160
and tried pushing me down the sink.

06:32.160 --> 06:33.760
Wait, inside and out is new.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.600
And he was yelling.

06:35.600 --> 06:36.680
That's a new interaction.

06:36.680 --> 06:38.120
That's a new piece of information.

06:38.120 --> 06:38.960
Guys, I'm not kidding.

06:38.960 --> 06:39.960
You're running like a hand puppet.

06:39.960 --> 06:43.160
It was like 10 minutes of him trying to push me down

06:43.160 --> 06:44.840
what he kept calling the sink hole.

06:44.840 --> 06:46.560
And I was like, do you mean the drain?

06:46.560 --> 06:48.560
Was he whipping your ass during that?

06:48.560 --> 06:49.400
Was it separate?

06:49.400 --> 06:50.840
We're gonna get a letter.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.160
We're gonna get a letter from someone.

06:52.160 --> 06:53.280
So did he whip your ass

06:53.280 --> 06:54.440
and then try to put you in the sink hole?

06:54.440 --> 06:57.480
Please ask the McElroy brothers not to talk about me anymore.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.160
He should have thought, I mean, it is my fault.

07:00.160 --> 07:02.240
I should have let him go first.

07:02.240 --> 07:03.080
I guess part of it.

07:03.080 --> 07:05.320
Did you try going in the sink hole to defuse it?

07:05.320 --> 07:06.560
I didn't, I did.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.920
God, it took so long.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.600
I started to get uncomfortable for him.

07:09.600 --> 07:13.240
And I was like, I'll try to go in the sink hole.

07:15.040 --> 07:15.880
How did it end?

07:15.880 --> 07:16.880
Where did you leave him?

07:16.880 --> 07:19.480
I ran, I mean, I stayed in the sink

07:19.480 --> 07:20.920
until he left the room.

07:22.240 --> 07:25.680
And then when I was outside, I grabbed a security person.

07:25.680 --> 07:30.280
And I was like, hey, and I pointed at him.

07:30.280 --> 07:32.280
I pointed at him and I was like, he just,

07:32.280 --> 07:34.360
and then he started yelling like again.

07:34.360 --> 07:38.320
And he was like, he kept yelling, I'm invisible today.

07:41.480 --> 07:42.320
Wait, now hold up.

07:42.320 --> 07:43.880
We don't even have time to unpack that.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.040
This is an advice show.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.560
We do advice here.

07:50.920 --> 07:54.200
No, wait, I do have to ask one more question.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.960
Did you try to fight back at all?

07:55.960 --> 07:57.960
Did you try to take a swing at him or anything?

07:57.960 --> 08:00.560
I did a couple of times, but then like,

08:00.560 --> 08:03.440
I kind of got invested in trying to fit in the sink hole.

08:04.440 --> 08:05.560
Would have been a great story.

08:05.560 --> 08:07.240
It was collaborative art at that point.

08:07.240 --> 08:09.320
And Mario makes it look so easy.

08:09.320 --> 08:10.160
I know.

08:12.360 --> 08:13.960
So this is an advice show.

08:13.960 --> 08:17.280
We take your questions and turn them alchemy-like

08:17.280 --> 08:18.120
into wisdom.

08:18.120 --> 08:20.360
And I realize now that I should have begun

08:20.360 --> 08:22.580
because it's never been more appropriate

08:22.580 --> 08:25.440
by saying we're so happy to be re-emerging

08:25.440 --> 08:27.820
with our proud Chilean miners.

08:31.200 --> 08:35.640
We return here to the Emerald City,

08:35.640 --> 08:40.640
Seatown, Jet City, the Queen City until 1982

08:40.760 --> 08:42.440
when they officially changed it to Emerald City.

08:42.440 --> 08:43.280
Wait, no, what?

08:43.280 --> 08:44.720
The Queen City's Cincinnati.

08:44.720 --> 08:45.600
That's right, they changed it.

08:45.600 --> 08:46.840
They were scared.

08:46.840 --> 08:47.680
Yeah, take that.

08:47.680 --> 08:50.480
That Cincinnati was gonna cross the country and-

08:50.480 --> 08:51.760
And beat them up.

08:51.760 --> 08:55.480
Like John Cena beating up Griffin McElroy.

08:55.480 --> 08:57.680
Who, by the way, John's people, if you're listening,

08:57.680 --> 08:59.240
was the one who told that story.

08:59.240 --> 09:00.120
Yeah, not us.

09:00.120 --> 09:00.960
Not us.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.860
It's very easy to confuse our three voices,

09:02.860 --> 09:05.160
but Griffin definitely told the story

09:05.160 --> 09:06.160
about how John Cena-

09:06.160 --> 09:07.120
I told that story.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.160
John wrote it with his actions.

09:10.080 --> 09:13.520
I, Justin McElroy, am still extremely hireable

09:13.520 --> 09:15.360
for any work that you may have.

09:15.360 --> 09:18.360
What the fuck are we hireable for at this point?

09:18.360 --> 09:20.400
I mean, they're making another Trolls, so-

09:20.400 --> 09:21.960
That is true.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.120
That is true.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.920
Hey, weirdly, because I'm sure,

09:27.920 --> 09:29.920
I just want to give you guys a scoop on this.

09:29.920 --> 09:33.220
No one has, let me check with Amanda.

09:33.220 --> 09:34.240
No, okay.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.320
They're playing coy.

09:35.320 --> 09:36.640
They're playing coy on this one.

09:36.640 --> 09:39.760
They haven't reached out yet about that one,

09:39.760 --> 09:44.040
but I'm assuming they'll eventually ask us

09:44.040 --> 09:44.880
to be in the movie.

09:44.880 --> 09:46.560
A much larger part, I have to assume.

09:46.560 --> 09:47.400
I have to assume.

09:47.400 --> 09:50.500
Yeah, a five-headed tall Troll.

09:50.500 --> 09:53.440
That will still not incorporate our dad.

09:53.440 --> 09:54.280
No.

09:54.280 --> 09:56.120
I don't know if you guys know this,

09:56.120 --> 09:58.460
but a lot has changed in the last three years.

09:58.460 --> 09:59.640
In these trying times.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.880
In these trying times, a lot has changed.

10:01.880 --> 10:04.600
I would say that in many ways, I think we've matured.

10:04.600 --> 10:07.580
Like a third of the audience just realized

10:07.580 --> 10:08.920
you were setting up a bit.

10:08.920 --> 10:11.880
The show has become, I would say, much classier.

10:11.880 --> 10:12.720
Oh God.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.120
Okay, that one.

10:14.120 --> 10:14.960
Much more artistic.

10:14.960 --> 10:18.080
Paul, I'm gonna need another White Claw, my man.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.080
And so I'd like to start this show off

10:21.240 --> 10:23.080
with a little high-class segment.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.720
I like to call it Work of Fart.

10:25.720 --> 10:26.560
Just say it.

10:26.560 --> 10:27.400
Yeah.

10:31.400 --> 10:32.760
Kidding aside, thanks, Paul.

10:32.760 --> 10:33.600
Thank you, Paul.

10:34.600 --> 10:35.440
Should we play?

10:35.440 --> 10:36.760
Kidding aside, before we move on,

10:36.760 --> 10:38.680
would it be possible for us to listen

10:38.680 --> 10:41.320
to the Work of Fart jingle in absolute silence

10:41.320 --> 10:42.880
so you guys can appreciate

10:42.880 --> 10:45.880
what a fucking low-grade fart sound?

10:45.880 --> 10:47.200
Okay, wait, let's all be quiet.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.280
Play it again, Paul.

10:49.480 --> 10:52.300
["Work of Fart"]

10:54.880 --> 10:56.240
Okay.

10:56.240 --> 10:59.400
So there are, there's, yeah.

10:59.400 --> 11:02.780
Sounds like a fucking key chain.

11:02.780 --> 11:05.360
It sounds like a key chain you press a button on.

11:05.360 --> 11:09.000
It sounds like a fucking yak back from like 1994.

11:10.240 --> 11:12.620
It was a free use sound effect.

11:12.620 --> 11:13.460
I don't know what to tell you.

11:13.460 --> 11:14.280
We're not gonna spend money on this podcast?

11:14.280 --> 11:17.040
We're not gonna spend money on Work of Fart?

11:17.040 --> 11:19.120
Are you kidding me?

11:19.120 --> 11:22.200
How am I gonna explain that to an accountant of any kind?

11:22.200 --> 11:24.360
Now, I see a charge here for $1.79.

11:24.360 --> 11:25.200
What is that for?

11:25.200 --> 11:26.240
I'm paying for a fart?

11:27.200 --> 11:30.720
It had to be a good fart so my brothers liked a bit.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.280
No, that part, I think that is actually a federal crime

11:33.280 --> 11:35.040
to lie to your accountant, so I don't think.

11:35.040 --> 11:36.780
So here's how it works.

11:37.860 --> 11:39.100
I have some-

11:39.100 --> 11:40.360
Now really listen,

11:40.360 --> 11:42.740
because the rules are pretty complicated.

11:44.520 --> 11:48.620
I have some classics here of different kinds,

11:48.620 --> 11:50.040
and I will list the description

11:50.040 --> 11:51.900
and all my brothers have to do

11:51.900 --> 11:54.600
is give me the title of that classic.

11:54.600 --> 11:58.040
For example, if I sat a genius detective

11:58.040 --> 12:00.060
who uses deductive reasoning

12:00.060 --> 12:02.660
and is also very confident in his penis.

12:03.560 --> 12:04.840
The Sherlock Holmes.

12:04.840 --> 12:05.880
Yeah, exactly.

12:05.880 --> 12:06.960
Thank you, Griffin.

12:06.960 --> 12:10.280
Yeah, I fucking hate how good I am.

12:11.880 --> 12:14.240
Justin, I think you're gonna win this one.

12:14.240 --> 12:15.080
Okay.

12:15.080 --> 12:16.720
You're not, but it's because Griffin,

12:16.720 --> 12:18.680
Griffin and I have kind of the same twisted

12:18.680 --> 12:20.800
Southwark style sense of humor.

12:20.800 --> 12:21.640
Okay.

12:21.640 --> 12:25.760
So this first one, I framed kind of like a trailer

12:25.760 --> 12:26.840
description while I'm here.

12:26.840 --> 12:28.680
Oh, cool.

12:28.680 --> 12:30.940
That ought to fix it.

12:30.940 --> 12:35.940
This orphan waif having been tossed aside

12:38.440 --> 12:43.280
by numerous people is back and ready for action.

12:44.260 --> 12:49.260
He's angry and he wants more revenge.

12:50.220 --> 12:54.660
This has nothing to do with using the bathroom.

12:54.660 --> 12:58.300
Well, what's the word for angry?

12:58.300 --> 13:00.260
Oh, Oliver Pissed?

13:00.260 --> 13:02.580
That's us. There it is.

13:02.580 --> 13:03.500
Tied.

13:04.620 --> 13:05.820
That's a tie point.

13:05.820 --> 13:06.780
That's a tie point.

13:06.780 --> 13:07.620
Are you ready?

13:07.620 --> 13:10.140
Yeah, and don't give us a double hint.

13:10.140 --> 13:11.500
That felt cheap to me.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.340
Yeah.

13:12.340 --> 13:15.340
Humphrey Bogart has to help.

13:15.340 --> 13:16.300
Humphrey Beaufort.

13:16.300 --> 13:17.260
Nope.

13:17.260 --> 13:20.340
I said it wouldn't be that.

13:21.380 --> 13:22.740
God, it's like you've never played

13:22.740 --> 13:24.140
a word of fart before.

13:24.140 --> 13:24.980
Okay, I'm ready.

13:24.980 --> 13:25.800
I'm ready.

13:25.800 --> 13:28.860
Humphrey Bogart has to help his ex-girlfriend

13:28.860 --> 13:30.820
escape a Moroccan city

13:30.820 --> 13:33.340
if only he can stop masturbating.

13:33.340 --> 13:34.180
Casablanca.

13:34.180 --> 13:35.620
Yes!

13:35.620 --> 13:36.460
Wow.

13:38.580 --> 13:40.460
And Travis, may I say,

13:40.460 --> 13:42.900
just to doff my cap to you, sir,

13:42.900 --> 13:44.540
the easy one was Asablanca

13:44.540 --> 13:46.460
and you didn't walk down that route.

13:46.460 --> 13:47.300
Not as good.

13:47.300 --> 13:48.740
Not as good as Casablanca.

13:48.740 --> 13:50.940
Yeah, that's real good.

13:50.940 --> 13:52.600
Yeah, we can all agree.

13:52.600 --> 13:57.600
After being framed for a crime he didn't commit

13:59.400 --> 14:03.100
and sent to a terrible French prison,

14:03.100 --> 14:05.960
Edmond Dantes is back,

14:05.960 --> 14:08.100
posing as a rich gentleman,

14:08.100 --> 14:11.540
attempting to get his revenge on his enemies

14:11.540 --> 14:12.760
by shoving his hand as far as-

14:12.760 --> 14:13.600
Santa Monica Stowe.

14:13.600 --> 14:14.440
Yes!

14:14.440 --> 14:15.280
Wow.

14:21.840 --> 14:22.680
Next!

14:23.880 --> 14:24.860
Next one!

14:24.860 --> 14:25.700
What's the score?

14:25.700 --> 14:27.400
It's two-two, right?

14:27.400 --> 14:28.240
Well, here's the weird,

14:28.240 --> 14:29.320
that was all I had.

14:29.320 --> 14:30.160
Damn it.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.720
You son of a gun!

14:31.720 --> 14:33.200
Come up with another one right now.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.760
Come up with another one fresh.

14:34.760 --> 14:36.080
Just fresh, right off the dome.

14:36.080 --> 14:36.920
Okay, great.

14:38.720 --> 14:43.720
Ariel is dying to join Prince Eric.

14:43.720 --> 14:44.800
The Little Spermaid?

14:44.800 --> 14:47.160
In a land filled with flatulence,

14:47.160 --> 14:48.920
in this I Want song.

14:51.120 --> 14:51.960
Fart of Your World.

14:51.960 --> 14:52.800
Yes!

14:56.040 --> 14:59.240
A rare work of fart victory

14:59.240 --> 15:00.920
for Justin McElroy.

15:00.920 --> 15:02.460
Wow, this is huge, huge.

15:04.120 --> 15:04.960
This is-

15:04.960 --> 15:05.800
It's weird.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.120
That's weird I like this bit now.

15:07.120 --> 15:08.160
That's weird.

15:08.160 --> 15:09.600
This is doubly humiliating

15:09.600 --> 15:13.960
because I didn't have to say The Little Spermaid.

15:13.960 --> 15:16.000
Or Asa Blanca.

15:17.400 --> 15:18.440
Yeah.

15:18.440 --> 15:23.440
I see your true colors shining through.

15:25.080 --> 15:26.440
So as I was saying,

15:26.440 --> 15:27.960
this is an advice show.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.680
And we're gonna help some people right now.

15:32.680 --> 15:33.840
Here we go.

15:33.840 --> 15:37.040
I'm in the middle of creating a delicious bowl of chili.

15:37.040 --> 15:40.080
One of its ingredients being a bottle of lager beer.

15:42.440 --> 15:43.480
Lager beer.

15:43.480 --> 15:44.360
Okay.

15:44.360 --> 15:48.720
I've effed up and forgot to get this ingredient.

15:48.720 --> 15:50.040
But there's good news.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.000
My neighbor is having a birthday celebration

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
which he invited me to stop by for.

15:55.600 --> 15:59.080
In fact, I already did drop by

15:59.080 --> 16:01.360
to drop off a few baked goods as a birthday gift

16:01.360 --> 16:03.480
before returning to my apartment to do chores.

16:03.480 --> 16:06.160
One of which was making this chili that brings us to now.

16:06.160 --> 16:07.440
Would it be weird for me to-

16:07.440 --> 16:08.280
Yep.

16:09.680 --> 16:12.600
Would it be weird for me to go and grab a beer

16:12.600 --> 16:15.640
from this celebration and then walk back to my apartment?

16:15.640 --> 16:19.000
It seems like it would look like a dick move

16:19.000 --> 16:22.440
or at least just weird, but I was invited.

16:22.440 --> 16:26.880
I did provide snacks and I wanna make this chili.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.960
Which honestly, friend, you should have listed first

16:29.960 --> 16:31.640
because that's what's driving you.

16:31.640 --> 16:32.760
What's my move?

16:32.760 --> 16:35.520
That's from Chili Maker in Chapel Hill.

16:35.520 --> 16:38.720
What I love, I think we need to change

16:38.720 --> 16:40.400
the way people ask these questions

16:40.400 --> 16:41.640
because I think it should be like,

16:41.640 --> 16:44.520
is this a higher level weird than normal,

16:44.520 --> 16:45.560
weird human behavior?

16:45.560 --> 16:47.160
Yeah, everybody's a baseline weird.

16:47.160 --> 16:49.720
Our baseline for that's pretty fucked up, gang.

16:49.720 --> 16:53.120
Yeah, because we've all done this, not this thing.

16:53.120 --> 16:53.960
Not this thing.

16:53.960 --> 16:54.800
Yeah.

16:54.800 --> 16:55.640
No, never, this.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.640
But we've done a thing that you've told the story

16:57.640 --> 16:59.680
like three years later and seen the look

16:59.680 --> 17:01.520
on someone else's face and gone,

17:01.520 --> 17:03.320
oh, this isn't as charming as I thought.

17:03.320 --> 17:04.840
I thought this was kind of roguish.

17:04.840 --> 17:08.120
Okay, I think this may be a helpful way of framing it.

17:08.120 --> 17:10.720
If you throw a party and someone comes

17:10.720 --> 17:12.640
and they have a kick-ass time,

17:12.640 --> 17:15.400
but then they leave to go do chores,

17:15.400 --> 17:16.240
and then they come-

17:16.240 --> 17:17.080
Next door.

17:17.080 --> 17:18.960
Next door, and then they come back in

17:18.960 --> 17:23.040
an hour and a half later and they grab a beer

17:23.040 --> 17:24.960
and then they leave with the beer

17:24.960 --> 17:28.440
as if to say, I got thirsty next door,

17:29.680 --> 17:30.640
and then they drink that beer.

17:30.640 --> 17:33.240
You would think, pretty inconsiderate friend.

17:33.240 --> 17:35.880
Does the same hold true if they walk in

17:35.880 --> 17:37.920
and grab a beer and say, don't worry,

17:37.920 --> 17:39.400
this is for my chili.

17:40.920 --> 17:43.840
Is it the same, is it-

17:43.840 --> 17:46.320
What if you say like, I'll be back with some chili soon.

17:46.320 --> 17:47.440
That's one thing.

17:47.440 --> 17:50.240
You gotta return with some, like a sampling of the chili,

17:50.240 --> 17:52.160
but you're not making enough for a party.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.000
No way.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.240
So you're gonna have a small solo cup full of chili.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.000
This is for the after party of just you and me, Derek.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.320
Yeah, a chili fest style sample cup with styrofoam.

18:02.320 --> 18:04.280
I actually think it's the one ingredient

18:04.280 --> 18:06.160
that it is better if you walked in and said,

18:06.160 --> 18:07.120
this is for chili.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.560
Cause if you walked in your neighbor's house

18:08.560 --> 18:09.600
and went through their cupboard

18:09.600 --> 18:12.040
and grabbed like just a bag of dry beans

18:12.040 --> 18:13.800
or like looked through their refrigerator

18:13.800 --> 18:15.840
for a pound of ground beef or something,

18:15.840 --> 18:18.680
you said, sorry, just need this for chili real quick.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.120
But if you grab a beer and said, I need this for chili,

18:21.120 --> 18:24.280
I think there's enough going on that someone will go, okay.

18:24.280 --> 18:25.120
And then only think about-

18:25.120 --> 18:26.360
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

18:26.360 --> 18:28.720
In this circumstance, what you have set up

18:28.720 --> 18:30.280
is the situation where somebody's gonna be like,

18:30.280 --> 18:33.240
hey, where are you going with that beer?

18:33.240 --> 18:35.760
It's like, well, you know, it's a party.

18:35.760 --> 18:37.160
So I'm just getting a beer.

18:37.160 --> 18:39.600
Well, no, the nice thing is because you live next door,

18:39.600 --> 18:41.440
you can go ahead and crack it open right there.

18:41.440 --> 18:45.000
Pretend to drink and make like a glug, glug, glug, glug.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.480
Love that beer flavor.

18:46.480 --> 18:48.320
I'm going to hate to waste this.

18:48.320 --> 18:50.000
I look so fizzy in my nose.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.320
And hate to waste this on chili.

18:52.320 --> 18:53.480
You guys feel me?

18:54.400 --> 18:56.160
I'm gonna go drink this next door

18:56.160 --> 18:57.680
so I can really savor it.

18:57.680 --> 18:58.920
Savor this.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.720
And if you smell chili later,

19:00.720 --> 19:03.440
then I made another drunken oops.

19:03.440 --> 19:07.680
I got so tagged off of this Corona.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.840
Excuse me, I should have picked any other beer.

19:09.840 --> 19:10.680
Yeah.

19:12.920 --> 19:15.400
You know what's funny is I actually,

19:15.400 --> 19:19.840
in my pantry, I do have about half of a six pack of Corona

19:19.840 --> 19:21.640
that I do specifically keep around

19:21.640 --> 19:24.080
for chili-based sort of experiences.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.840
I can't imagine it's for drinking.

19:25.840 --> 19:26.840
No, not anymore.

19:26.840 --> 19:29.360
Not today.

19:29.360 --> 19:30.880
That's a tough break, guys.

19:30.880 --> 19:34.160
Hey, tough break to my friends over at the Corona Foundation.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.320
Does it change it at all?

19:36.320 --> 19:38.160
If someone walks into your party, grabs a beer,

19:38.160 --> 19:39.680
and says, this is for chili, and leaves,

19:39.680 --> 19:41.000
there will still be people at that party

19:41.000 --> 19:42.800
who's like, who's that asshole?

19:42.800 --> 19:43.720
But-

19:43.720 --> 19:45.320
They're probably already doing that though.

19:45.320 --> 19:47.240
To be fair, people love judging people.

19:47.240 --> 19:49.200
Absolutely, but would the same be true

19:49.200 --> 19:53.160
if I walked in shirtless with a cape on

19:53.160 --> 19:56.040
and grabbed a beer and yelled like, this is for chili?

19:56.040 --> 19:58.000
And then laugh, people would be like,

19:58.000 --> 19:59.920
who the fuck was that guy?

20:01.160 --> 20:04.000
Well, grab that and a lamp yelling this is for chili.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.480
These are both going in, baby.

20:06.480 --> 20:07.320
This one's for me.

20:07.320 --> 20:08.440
I'm trying some stuff.

20:08.440 --> 20:09.720
It's been a weird year.

20:09.720 --> 20:12.080
This one's for chili and this one's for dad.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.080
Let's go.

20:14.960 --> 20:17.240
Wait, which one was which in that example?

20:17.240 --> 20:19.080
I'm gonna eat this fucking lamp.

20:19.080 --> 20:19.920
Woo!

20:24.040 --> 20:25.240
You can just do what I do

20:25.240 --> 20:28.720
and just run in, just like, oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.440
And then do it while you're still doing that.

20:30.440 --> 20:32.000
Nobody's gonna stop and question you.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.280
They'll be like, it seemed like an emergency.

20:34.280 --> 20:37.680
Especially if you say like, quick, where's the beer?

20:37.680 --> 20:39.400
I have a beer emergency.

20:40.560 --> 20:41.400
How about another question?

20:41.400 --> 20:42.240
Please.

20:42.240 --> 20:45.840
My sister is getting her nipples tattooed.

20:45.840 --> 20:49.080
You're starting Chicago Bulls.

20:50.960 --> 20:54.280
She has many tattoos already.

20:54.280 --> 20:56.160
And I like to be supportive and encouraging

20:56.160 --> 20:57.520
when she gets new ones.

20:57.520 --> 21:00.360
How do I appropriately compliment her new nipple tats

21:00.360 --> 21:02.760
without being weird?

21:02.760 --> 21:05.480
I already follow her tattoo artists on Instagram.

21:05.480 --> 21:07.520
So I know I'll be seeing at least some

21:07.520 --> 21:10.480
slightly censored version of the artwork.

21:10.480 --> 21:14.200
It should be a good regular day for you, I bet.

21:15.600 --> 21:18.040
That's from Let's Nip It in the Bud.

21:19.360 --> 21:20.200
That's fun.

21:20.200 --> 21:22.840
Well, I thought, so when I picked this question,

21:22.840 --> 21:27.000
I thought we could do a little scene work

21:27.000 --> 21:28.560
because we are- Oh, good.

21:28.560 --> 21:32.440
We're siblings and we all have tattoos and nipples.

21:32.440 --> 21:35.280
And we're famously good at doing characters.

21:35.280 --> 21:38.280
And I thought maybe we could do this like, you know,

21:38.280 --> 21:40.680
and you can pick either one of your brothers

21:40.680 --> 21:43.120
to compliment their nipples if you want to.

21:43.120 --> 21:44.200
And like, just pretend-

21:44.200 --> 21:46.120
Well, the tattoo that has been recently applied-

21:46.120 --> 21:48.760
I mean, yes, obviously, it goes hand in hand.

21:48.760 --> 21:49.640
Yeah, I guess.

21:49.640 --> 21:52.320
It's never happened before in my life.

21:52.320 --> 21:53.160
Oh, really?

21:53.160 --> 21:55.280
Because our friend Barbara has a ham tattooed

21:55.280 --> 21:56.120
on his nipple where the nipple is-

21:56.120 --> 21:59.920
I've seen his ham nipple and it's exquisite.

21:59.920 --> 22:01.680
But I don't think I've ever said word one

22:01.680 --> 22:04.960
about the fact that either of you even have nipples.

22:04.960 --> 22:06.640
Hey, can I say, I've noticed that?

22:06.640 --> 22:08.320
And it's actually weird that you've gone this long

22:08.320 --> 22:09.160
without acknowledging them.

22:09.160 --> 22:10.000
It has been.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.480
Hey guys, you have four nipples between the two of you.

22:13.480 --> 22:17.640
But we won't say between who, you know what?

22:17.640 --> 22:19.880
All right, now, Justin, say something about Griffin's nipples.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.960
I'm remaining completely motionless

22:21.960 --> 22:24.600
in the hopes that my brothers will forget I am here.

22:26.960 --> 22:30.320
Perhaps the podcast will proceed without me

22:30.320 --> 22:32.200
and move on to a different segment

22:32.200 --> 22:34.440
in which I am more comfortable participating.

22:35.640 --> 22:38.000
You guys.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.040
Hoo, guys.

22:40.040 --> 22:44.000
Where to start making jokes about your nipples.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.560
That's our job, baby.

22:47.560 --> 22:50.760
Ah, boy, I love these.

22:50.760 --> 22:55.160
These guys, if you knew them like I knew them.

22:55.160 --> 22:58.280
Woo, these nipples.

23:00.160 --> 23:04.360
You gotta be proud of that.

23:04.360 --> 23:05.760
What's your favorite part?

23:05.760 --> 23:08.920
Oh, don't make him choose.

23:08.920 --> 23:12.240
Gosh, where they look.

23:15.280 --> 23:19.640
This just really shows that you're a Star Wars fan.

23:19.640 --> 23:23.760
When you go to that length for a nipple tattoo.

23:23.760 --> 23:27.640
It's actually a Stewie Griffin in a Darth Vader helmet.

23:27.640 --> 23:28.480
Did you catch that?

23:28.480 --> 23:30.560
I got that, yeah.

23:30.560 --> 23:33.320
How did you integrate the nipple into that exactly?

23:33.320 --> 23:35.400
It's his left and right eyes.

23:37.440 --> 23:40.720
That is a big Stewie Griffin.

23:40.720 --> 23:41.960
That's a real big.

23:41.960 --> 23:42.920
It's a life-size.

23:42.920 --> 23:44.480
That's why I had to go.

23:44.480 --> 23:45.440
Can I be honest?

23:45.440 --> 23:47.400
I said originally I just wanted a Darth Vader,

23:47.400 --> 23:50.480
but because of sort of the wingspan,

23:50.480 --> 23:53.160
it looked a little more sort of.

23:53.160 --> 23:54.520
And a lot of it was just following

23:54.520 --> 23:56.440
the natural contours of his body.

23:56.440 --> 23:57.280
Right, yeah.

23:58.240 --> 23:59.600
And it kind of actually looks

23:59.600 --> 24:03.200
like a very tired, dark Stewie Griffin.

24:04.720 --> 24:08.920
It was free-handed with a lot of it.

24:08.920 --> 24:10.080
Travis actually did it.

24:10.080 --> 24:11.920
I did it, it's so cool.

24:11.920 --> 24:14.040
It was my first one and I really appreciate

24:14.040 --> 24:17.120
the trust you put in me for my first tattoo.

24:17.120 --> 24:18.800
It took a long time.

24:18.800 --> 24:21.480
Yeah, it looks like it took a long time.

24:21.480 --> 24:22.840
It was a labor of love.

24:22.840 --> 24:23.680
It was like that.

24:23.680 --> 24:24.640
I got that vibe.

24:24.640 --> 24:25.480
Yeah, for sure.

24:25.480 --> 24:26.880
So what do you think of my handiwork?

24:26.880 --> 24:29.880
Why is it still me, do you think?

24:29.880 --> 24:30.840
Why am I still the-

24:30.840 --> 24:32.400
Why tattooed?

24:32.400 --> 24:33.600
Griffin got the tattoo.

24:33.600 --> 24:35.040
Yeah, why is it still me?

24:35.040 --> 24:37.560
It feels like other people should have a turn.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.440
Everyone is sort of feeling bad for-

24:39.440 --> 24:40.880
Hey Griffin, what do you think about

24:40.880 --> 24:42.640
what Justin thinks about your nipple tattoo?

24:42.640 --> 24:44.680
Hurts my feelings a lot.

24:44.680 --> 24:45.520
Hurts my feelings a lot.

24:45.520 --> 24:46.720
Justin, do you want to address that?

24:46.720 --> 24:48.240
I think it's important to remember

24:48.240 --> 24:49.440
that none of this happened.

24:49.440 --> 24:50.360
You remember the part where he thought

24:50.360 --> 24:52.600
it was just Darth Vader and not Stewie Griffin?

24:52.600 --> 24:53.720
I did catch that.

24:53.720 --> 24:54.560
We were supposed to have fun.

24:54.560 --> 24:56.440
And then he asked how you integrated it

24:56.440 --> 24:58.280
as if he couldn't see Stewie's eyes.

24:58.280 --> 25:00.160
I was enjoying it at first.

25:00.160 --> 25:01.560
The show, not this bit.

25:01.560 --> 25:03.440
It sounds like you really hurt Griffin's feelings.

25:03.440 --> 25:04.560
Is there anything you want to say?

25:04.560 --> 25:05.400
Say it to me now.

25:05.400 --> 25:08.800
I, you know, people grow.

25:08.800 --> 25:11.720
Yeah, I actually heard that was going to be a problem

25:11.720 --> 25:14.920
for the tattoo, the dimensions.

25:14.920 --> 25:17.760
People change, one sec, one sec.

25:17.760 --> 25:18.680
Let me, let me-

25:18.680 --> 25:19.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:19.520 --> 25:20.360
Think about it.

25:21.760 --> 25:23.600
Let me see them again.

25:23.600 --> 25:24.440
I-

25:40.360 --> 25:42.560
Great jokes, us from last week.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.000
Hey, Griffin here.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.920
And I'm here to tell you about our sponsors this week.

25:45.920 --> 25:48.040
Like for instance, Brooklinen.

25:48.040 --> 25:49.000
I don't know about y'all,

25:49.000 --> 25:51.480
but the holidays done snuck up on me this year.

25:51.480 --> 25:53.440
And I'm like, what am I going to gift everyone?

25:53.440 --> 25:56.680
You know, a bunch of those sticky slime hands?

25:56.680 --> 25:58.520
No, I did that last year, damn it.

25:58.520 --> 26:00.320
Luckily there's Brooklinen,

26:00.320 --> 26:03.440
which has a perfect presence for everyone on your list.

26:03.440 --> 26:04.760
Brooklinen started with bedding.

26:04.760 --> 26:05.680
You know this.

26:05.680 --> 26:07.320
But now they offer all the essentials

26:07.320 --> 26:09.880
to make every corner of your home next level comfy.

26:09.880 --> 26:11.480
They got five-star sheets.

26:11.480 --> 26:13.800
They got dreamy decor.

26:13.800 --> 26:15.760
They got cozy loungewear.

26:15.760 --> 26:17.560
They got a new line of slippers.

26:17.560 --> 26:19.160
They have freaking candles, man.

26:19.160 --> 26:22.400
Everything to turn your house into a cozy little cocoon.

26:22.400 --> 26:25.360
That cozy loungewear is nothing to mess with.

26:25.360 --> 26:26.280
When I slip mine on,

26:26.280 --> 26:28.920
I feel like a luxurious little gentleman

26:28.920 --> 26:33.920
on my way back from the spa that is in my basement.

26:34.680 --> 26:35.760
That didn't make much sense,

26:35.760 --> 26:37.800
but give the gift of comfort this holiday season

26:37.800 --> 26:40.400
and order now to get items on time.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.160

Brooklinen.com, promo code, my brother.

26:56.120 --> 26:58.560
Squarespace was also kind enough to sponsor us this week.

26:58.560 --> 27:01.720
Squarespace is the platform you use to make a website

27:01.720 --> 27:04.240
that will beat every other website's ass

27:04.240 --> 27:05.600
right into the ground.

27:05.600 --> 27:08.000
They have the tools you need to showcase your work,

27:08.000 --> 27:09.640
sell products and services of all kinds,

27:09.640 --> 27:11.640
promote your physical or online business,

27:11.640 --> 27:14.240
and more, and that's for you to fill in

27:14.240 --> 27:16.600
with your filthy mind what that means.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.320

27:33.360 --> 27:37.040

27:37.040 --> 27:39.620
And of course, I cannot forget about Bombas.

27:39.620 --> 27:40.760
Bombas' mission is simple.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.280
They make the most comfortable clothes ever,

27:42.280 --> 27:45.320
and they match every item sold with an equal item donated.

27:45.320 --> 27:47.600
So this holiday, when you gift Bombas to someone

27:47.600 --> 27:50.720
on your list, you're also giving them to someone in need.

27:50.720 --> 27:51.920
It's a give-give.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.540
Bombas designed their socks, shirts, and underwear

27:53.540 --> 27:55.200
to be the clothes you can't wait to put on every day.

27:55.200 --> 27:57.880
Everything's soft and seamless and tagless

27:57.880 --> 28:01.760
and feels good on the body parts that you have.

28:01.760 --> 28:04.440
They're made from super soft materials like merino wool,

28:04.440 --> 28:07.240
Pima cotton, and even cashmere,

28:07.240 --> 28:09.360
which makes them the perfect cozy winter layers.

28:09.360 --> 28:11.520
And they're also cozy gifts for everyone on your list

28:11.520 --> 28:13.180
because they got these festive gift boxes

28:13.180 --> 28:14.840
you don't even need to freaking wrap, man,

28:14.840 --> 28:16.160
because you're already busy enough.

28:16.160 --> 28:17.560
All you gotta do is give them.

28:17.560 --> 28:19.260
So go to Bombas.com slash my brother

28:27.720 --> 28:30.080
Gonna go quick with the announcements very fast.

We have a virtual Candle Nights special

28:31.480 --> 28:33.620
coming up December 18th at 9 p.m. Eastern time.

28:33.620 --> 28:36.960
You can get tickets at bit.ly slash Candle Nights 2021.

28:36.960 --> 28:38.120
It's a virtual show.

28:38.120 --> 28:39.160
It's lots of fun.

28:39.160 --> 28:42.320
All the podcasts did segments for it.

28:42.320 --> 28:44.400
We got lots of friends and family members

28:44.400 --> 28:47.000
who did stuff for it and all the sales for that.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.240
The tickets are $5 with an option to give more.

28:49.240 --> 28:50.880
Go to Benefit Harmony House,

28:50.880 --> 28:52.320
a wonderful organization in Huntington

28:52.320 --> 28:54.840
that goes to support people experiencing homelessness.

28:54.840 --> 28:56.840
We also have the Zone of Adventure and Balance series.

28:56.840 --> 28:59.240
That's all up on the YouTube.com slash the McElroy family

28:59.240 --> 29:01.620
and a bunch of new merch over at McElroymerch.com,

29:01.620 --> 29:04.220
including the pin of the month, which is Steely Van,

29:04.220 --> 29:05.200
sales for which benefit

29:05.200 --> 29:07.920
the Asian Pacific Environmental Network.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.320
There's a My Brother, My Brother,

29:09.320 --> 29:12.320
and the Man Who Ruined My FYP sticker,

29:12.320 --> 29:14.480
referencing Justin's incredible summoning

29:14.480 --> 29:16.040
of the berries and cream.

29:16.040 --> 29:18.160
There's a Zone of Adventure enamel pin.

29:18.160 --> 29:20.280
There's so much stuff at McElroymerch.com.

29:24.040 --> 29:25.200
Hey there, beautiful people.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.760
I'm Trevelle Anderson.

29:26.760 --> 29:27.880
And I'm Jared Hill.

29:27.880 --> 29:30.200
We are the hosts of Fantai,

29:30.200 --> 29:33.720
the show where we have complex and complicado conversations

29:33.720 --> 29:35.360
about the gray areas in our lives,

29:35.360 --> 29:37.960
the things that we really, really love sometimes,

29:37.960 --> 29:41.180
but also have some problematic feelings about.

29:41.180 --> 29:43.640
Yes, we get into it all.

29:43.640 --> 29:45.360
You want to know our thoughts about Nicki Minaj

29:45.360 --> 29:46.520
and all her foolishness?

29:46.520 --> 29:47.360
We got you.

29:47.360 --> 29:49.400
You want to know our thoughts about gentrification,

29:49.400 --> 29:52.080
perhaps some positive question mark,

29:52.080 --> 29:53.560
aspects of gentrification?

29:53.560 --> 29:55.300
We get into that too.

29:55.300 --> 29:57.720
Every single Thursday, you can check us out

29:57.720 --> 30:00.080
at MaximumFun.org.

30:00.080 --> 30:01.720
Listen, you know you want it, honey,

30:01.720 --> 30:03.480
so come on and get it.

30:03.480 --> 30:08.480
Period.

30:08.920 --> 30:09.760
Here's another question.

30:09.760 --> 30:11.080
Yeah, please.

30:11.080 --> 30:13.040
The kid I tutor broke his hand

30:13.040 --> 30:15.680
and wants me to paint his cast for him.

30:15.680 --> 30:17.840
I'm not super artistically gifted,

30:17.840 --> 30:19.920
but I don't want to let him down.

30:19.920 --> 30:21.960
What could I paint on an eighth graders arm

30:21.960 --> 30:23.400
to make him look cool,

30:23.400 --> 30:25.760
but not super difficult to do?

30:25.760 --> 30:28.680
That's from in way over her head in North Texas.

30:28.680 --> 30:31.920
Why did, why did that kid ask you to paint?

30:31.920 --> 30:34.860
Like why, what, maybe they only know one adult.

30:34.860 --> 30:36.960
That's entirely possible.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.280
That's sad, but fair.

30:41.160 --> 30:42.000
Let's see.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.320
I mean, this is a great question for us

30:43.320 --> 30:46.880
because we definitely know what people of that generation

30:46.880 --> 30:49.000
are super into and think is cool.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.640
Eventually they're going to lose interest in Fortnite

30:51.640 --> 30:52.800
and then I'll really be lost.

30:52.800 --> 30:53.840
And that's it, yeah.

30:53.840 --> 30:55.360
Wait, oh.

30:55.360 --> 30:59.840
They seem to like pinatas and Minecraft.

30:59.840 --> 31:00.760
Yeah.

31:00.760 --> 31:02.600
Oh no, I'm hearing some no's.

31:02.600 --> 31:03.440
Okay.

31:03.440 --> 31:06.760
Well, put me in the casket, folks, legends.

31:06.760 --> 31:08.080
I'm done.

31:08.080 --> 31:11.480
Could you, instead of painting something

31:11.480 --> 31:14.680
or doing a picture, do some lettering

31:14.680 --> 31:17.840
to make it look like a Fortnite branded cast?

31:17.840 --> 31:18.760
Oh, that's cool.

31:18.760 --> 31:22.560
People like that brand that, is it Massive?

31:22.560 --> 31:23.460
Is that it?

31:23.460 --> 31:24.720
No, shit.

31:24.720 --> 31:26.840
Supreme is definitely it.

31:28.480 --> 31:30.560
A Supreme cast.

31:30.560 --> 31:32.920
Pretty close though, I think we can all agree.

31:34.040 --> 31:37.900
They practically rhyme, those two very similar words.

31:39.280 --> 31:41.080
Oh, fuck, that was embarrassing.

31:47.080 --> 31:48.200
I want to say something,

31:48.200 --> 31:50.520
but I'm really trying to savor this for a second.

31:50.520 --> 31:51.360
And then-

31:51.360 --> 31:52.840
You used to be the young cool one.

31:52.840 --> 31:54.160
Yeah, you were the young cool one.

31:54.160 --> 31:55.000
Yeah, yeah.

31:55.000 --> 31:55.880
We need a fourth one now.

31:55.880 --> 31:57.440
We need another one who's young.

31:57.440 --> 32:02.440
Dad, dad, what'd you, well, I mean, drugs.

32:07.160 --> 32:11.720
Just write the word drugs on it real big.

32:11.720 --> 32:14.680
You could write, ask me about drugs.

32:14.680 --> 32:15.880
There you go.

32:15.880 --> 32:16.720
Yeah, I know.

32:16.720 --> 32:17.560
But that's a trick question,

32:17.560 --> 32:18.380
because they'll be like, tell me about drugs.

32:18.380 --> 32:19.680
And you'd be like, they're bad.

32:19.680 --> 32:22.060
I have some literature for you.

32:22.060 --> 32:24.200
You fell into my trap, yeah.

32:24.200 --> 32:26.520
I keep them stuffed in my cask.

32:26.520 --> 32:29.560
Sorry I broke your arm, love, John Cena.

32:29.560 --> 32:30.400
That's good.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.040
That's really not his style, though.

32:33.040 --> 32:35.120
I don't want to talk about it again.

32:35.120 --> 32:38.080
I feel like his lawyers might just now be losing interest.

32:39.920 --> 32:42.040
I mean, maybe you could get, like,

32:42.040 --> 32:44.340
maybe it's like, get it branded.

32:44.340 --> 32:46.640
So it says like, hey, sorry about your arm,

32:46.640 --> 32:48.400
but make sure to check out Matrix,

32:48.400 --> 32:51.920
Reloaded, coming soon to H.E.O. Maxx.

32:51.920 --> 32:53.520
That's not the name of the film.

32:53.520 --> 32:57.800
Then what have I been waiting for?

33:01.800 --> 33:02.640
Could you-

33:02.640 --> 33:04.520
Draw a smaller cast.

33:04.520 --> 33:05.360
All right, okay.

33:05.360 --> 33:07.240
0.5% smaller.

33:08.240 --> 33:10.280
So it's just kind of fuzzy at the edges.

33:11.160 --> 33:12.280
I saw- That's dumb.

33:13.120 --> 33:17.160
Did you guys see what they're doing with the Matrix?

33:18.680 --> 33:19.800
What's the new Matrix?

33:19.800 --> 33:21.000
Resurrections. Thank you.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.360
Yeah, you're welcome.

33:22.360 --> 33:26.720
So Paul Sabourin of Paul and Storm fame

33:26.720 --> 33:31.720
and I went to go enjoy Ghostbusters Afterlife yesterday.

33:33.400 --> 33:34.920
In a regular theater, Justin?

33:34.920 --> 33:37.160
No, dipshit.

33:37.160 --> 33:40.920
It was a 4DX experience.

33:40.920 --> 33:44.400
Every time Slimer farted, my butt shook.

33:44.400 --> 33:48.520
Now, Justin, I know for a fact-

33:48.520 --> 33:50.360
Don't spoil the movie.

33:50.360 --> 33:51.620
We talked about this.

33:51.620 --> 33:54.000
Yeah, we talked about how we can't spoil the movie.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.680
And whether some Slimers may or may not appear in the film-

33:57.680 --> 34:00.440
And maybe you may or may not have lost a bet to Paul

34:00.440 --> 34:01.800
regarding that fact.

34:01.800 --> 34:03.720
I may have bet Paul a sum of money

34:03.720 --> 34:05.640
that Slimer would be in the movie.

34:05.640 --> 34:08.640
Without requiring Paul to match said bet.

34:08.640 --> 34:09.560
Yeah.

34:09.560 --> 34:11.480
So the best case scenario was

34:11.480 --> 34:14.160
you left with the same amount of money you began

34:14.160 --> 34:16.560
and got to see Slimer.

34:16.560 --> 34:18.400
Yeah, exactly.

34:18.400 --> 34:20.800
But the beginning of the movie,

34:20.800 --> 34:24.560
they have these, they're like commercials for other movies.

34:24.560 --> 34:26.440
And they did one for-

34:26.440 --> 34:28.760
You've seen this, okay.

34:28.760 --> 34:31.840
They had one for Matrix Resurrections.

34:31.840 --> 34:33.640
Erections, yeah.

34:33.640 --> 34:35.000
And before that-

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
You just said erections.

34:36.000 --> 34:36.840
Thanks, Trev.

34:38.720 --> 34:41.740
I actually think I said erections,

34:41.740 --> 34:44.200
which is now the only way I'm gonna say that word.

34:44.200 --> 34:46.360
Not that I say it a lot.

34:46.360 --> 34:47.200
Erectos.

34:47.200 --> 34:51.360
That gave me erection.

34:51.360 --> 34:54.240
Hello, hello, what's all this then?

34:54.240 --> 34:56.920
This is one of those erections I've heard about.

34:56.920 --> 34:57.760
There you go.

34:57.760 --> 34:58.920
So-

34:58.920 --> 35:00.080
Apples and pears.

35:00.080 --> 35:02.960
We were watching the commercial for the movie,

35:02.960 --> 35:05.560
but before it,

35:05.560 --> 35:08.020
it was, there was an ad that's like,

35:09.520 --> 35:11.480
Denny's has entered the matrix.

35:13.360 --> 35:17.040
And it's like, Denny's has glitch meals.

35:17.040 --> 35:19.720
Featuring your favorite Matrix characters.

35:19.720 --> 35:23.400
And it's like, I guess Matrix isn't cool anymore.

35:23.400 --> 35:25.120
Cause that made me feel pretty old.

35:25.120 --> 35:26.900
Cause I'm kind of excited about our new Matrix,

35:26.900 --> 35:31.200
but if the only brand partner they had on board was Denny's

35:31.200 --> 35:33.840
for this new Matrix flick, for their glitch meals.

35:33.840 --> 35:37.040
I like that their branding was Uh-Oh Meals.

35:37.040 --> 35:38.240
We made you glitch meals.

35:38.240 --> 35:39.480
There's a glitch in the Matrix.

35:39.480 --> 35:41.840
There's no way we'd give you this much bacon.

35:43.480 --> 35:45.820
Is that pancake a square?

35:45.820 --> 35:48.680
Must be a glitch meal.

35:49.860 --> 35:50.940
And then it's cats.

35:50.940 --> 35:52.980
There's black cats in it.

35:52.980 --> 35:54.780
In the, in the commercial?

35:54.780 --> 35:56.240
Or in the pancakes.

35:56.240 --> 35:57.380
It's in the pancakes.

35:57.380 --> 35:58.800
They're shaped like black cats.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.940
And it's like, whoa, I know Kung Fu.

36:00.940 --> 36:03.540
These Matrix jokes aren't landing.

36:03.540 --> 36:04.820
One, not jokes.

36:04.820 --> 36:08.300
Two, I feel like now that it's tied to Denny's,

36:08.300 --> 36:10.540
maybe the shine is kind of off the proverbial apple

36:10.540 --> 36:12.100
a little bit on Matrix.

36:12.100 --> 36:14.140
Maybe Matrix isn't gonna,

36:14.140 --> 36:16.580
against my box office prediction is,

36:16.580 --> 36:20.260
Matrix is not gonna do as well as some people might hope.

36:20.260 --> 36:21.660
Coming soon to HBO Max.

36:21.660 --> 36:22.500
Check it out.

36:22.500 --> 36:24.380
God, this is good shit.

36:24.380 --> 36:25.220
Antlers.

36:25.220 --> 36:27.100
It's like we never missed a day.

36:27.100 --> 36:29.100
Antlers are super cool.

36:29.100 --> 36:30.940
This is a statement of fact.

36:30.940 --> 36:33.500
I would love to start incorporating different antlers

36:33.500 --> 36:35.100
into my outfit rotation.

36:35.100 --> 36:39.420
Problem is, you could guess for a thousand years.

36:39.420 --> 36:40.260
And you would not guess the proper.

36:40.260 --> 36:42.900
You could think the problem is clotheslines.

36:42.900 --> 36:45.100
Problem is leaves blowing in the wind.

36:45.100 --> 36:47.140
Problem is animals need them.

36:47.140 --> 36:49.100
No, problem is I take-

36:49.100 --> 36:50.580
Confused hunters.

36:50.580 --> 36:52.400
Confused city hunters.

36:52.400 --> 36:55.460
Problem, there's deer near my house

36:55.460 --> 36:57.660
because I live in West Virginia on a hill.

36:57.660 --> 37:01.700
And every, literally like every West Virginia guy

37:01.700 --> 37:03.780
of a certain inclination and age,

37:03.780 --> 37:05.660
when he sees them, he's like,

37:05.660 --> 37:08.140
man, I'd love to come back up here with my bow.

37:08.140 --> 37:10.260
And I usually have to ask him like,

37:10.260 --> 37:12.780
do you mean to kill deer at my house?

37:12.780 --> 37:14.260
I'd rather you not.

37:14.260 --> 37:15.100
Thank you.

37:15.100 --> 37:17.100
Also, they're not just carrying their bow with them.

37:17.100 --> 37:17.940
Come on.

37:17.940 --> 37:19.140
Come on, it's in the trunk.

37:19.140 --> 37:21.320
Problem is I take public transit.

37:22.700 --> 37:23.620
I told you.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.940
Anything I wear is at risk of becoming an invitation

37:27.940 --> 37:31.340
for fellow passengers to strike up a conversation with me.

37:31.340 --> 37:33.020
Some risk higher than others.

37:33.020 --> 37:34.500
Yeah, in this case, I would say

37:34.500 --> 37:36.160
it would be their legal rights.

37:37.700 --> 37:41.560
Even if it's just to say, excuse me, are those antlers?

37:41.560 --> 37:43.740
Is there any way I can wear some dope antlers

37:43.740 --> 37:45.940
that doesn't include strangers

37:45.940 --> 37:48.500
butting into my podcast time?

37:48.500 --> 37:50.820
That's from not as horny as I'd like to be.

37:53.740 --> 37:54.900
I mean, no.

37:54.900 --> 37:56.140
Yeah.

37:56.140 --> 37:57.320
But that's not funny.

37:59.700 --> 38:02.780
If someone says like, hey, what's up with those antlers?

38:02.780 --> 38:03.600
You could just read.

38:03.600 --> 38:04.440
You go, what?

38:04.440 --> 38:05.260
What?

38:05.260 --> 38:06.100
Not again!

38:06.100 --> 38:08.120
Just pull the bus brake cord thing

38:08.120 --> 38:09.420
that I don't know if it does.

38:09.420 --> 38:11.020
It's been a while since I've been on a bus,

38:11.020 --> 38:14.780
but I don't think it brings the bus to a crashing halt.

38:14.780 --> 38:16.100
No, if anything, it just kind of-

38:16.100 --> 38:16.940
No, it is.

38:16.940 --> 38:19.460
Every passenger has the right to stop the bus

38:19.460 --> 38:21.580
wherever they want to.

38:21.580 --> 38:22.700
That would add to the bit though.

38:22.700 --> 38:23.540
If you're like, what?

38:23.540 --> 38:24.460
No!

38:24.460 --> 38:25.800
Why isn't this working?

38:27.020 --> 38:28.080
Not again!

38:30.540 --> 38:33.260
I mean, you could have some small tasteful antlers

38:33.260 --> 38:34.800
that maybe they don't notice.

38:34.800 --> 38:36.220
Some fashion antlers.

38:36.220 --> 38:39.340
Well, I just mean perhaps under a hat

38:39.340 --> 38:40.700
and then someone comes on the bus

38:40.700 --> 38:41.900
and you tip your hat to them.

38:41.900 --> 38:43.700
Just for a brief wink of a moment,

38:43.700 --> 38:45.420
they think, excuse me, are those antlers?

38:45.420 --> 38:47.180
No, it must've been my imagination.

38:47.180 --> 38:49.260
And now you've given them a story, my lads.

38:49.260 --> 38:50.100
Yeah.

38:51.180 --> 38:54.440
Oh, you're not gonna believe this story I have for you.

38:54.440 --> 38:56.140
The wildest thing happening today.

38:56.140 --> 38:58.220
I met Mr. Tumnus, I think.

38:58.220 --> 39:03.060
At first I was like, why does that person have

39:03.060 --> 39:06.500
like a wild Dr. Seuss Jamiroquai hat on?

39:06.500 --> 39:07.740
And I was like at first,

39:07.740 --> 39:10.220
like maybe they have antlers under there.

39:10.220 --> 39:12.220
He called himself Mr. Tumbus.

39:12.220 --> 39:15.060
And I thought that was a little on the nose.

39:16.940 --> 39:21.560
I guess like why, if you want to keep it incognito,

39:21.560 --> 39:25.320
there are many accessories that are not antlers

39:25.320 --> 39:26.700
that I would recommend.

39:27.540 --> 39:29.760
Like a flower or a hat.

39:30.960 --> 39:32.640
Those are just two off the top of my head.

39:32.640 --> 39:35.020
I bet I can list as many others given the opportunity.

39:35.020 --> 39:35.860
Give it a shot.

39:35.860 --> 39:37.140
Hot shot.

39:37.140 --> 39:38.300
Regular shirt.

39:38.300 --> 39:43.020
Okay, I wouldn't call a regular shirt an accessory.

39:43.020 --> 39:46.020
It's on your ear, it's wrapped around your arm.

39:46.020 --> 39:48.820
Like a, you know, like a.

39:48.820 --> 39:51.500
That's not a regular shirt then.

39:51.500 --> 39:53.580
It's a regular shirt that you've wrapped around your arm

39:53.580 --> 39:54.580
like Bruce Springsteen.

39:54.580 --> 39:58.260
No, I would say that that inherently makes it irregular.

39:58.260 --> 40:01.020
Regular shirt, weird place.

40:01.020 --> 40:02.900
Name some different places you can put shirts

40:02.900 --> 40:05.100
where people will be like, I don't think so.

40:05.100 --> 40:10.100
Could you, when they say, hey, what's up with those antlers?

40:11.580 --> 40:13.180
You just look up at them and go.

40:13.180 --> 40:18.180
And I'm going to say after that awesome joke

40:23.460 --> 40:27.900
that I don't know what sound a deer makes.

40:28.940 --> 40:32.340
It's also a good way to guarantee no one tries to talk to

40:32.340 --> 40:33.660
you for the rest of the trip.

40:33.660 --> 40:38.660
Yeah, unless they're like a secret crypto zoologist.

40:40.380 --> 40:42.500
They're like, oh shit, actually, all right.

40:42.500 --> 40:45.100
May I sidle on up next?

40:45.100 --> 40:48.100
I never thought I'd meet a goat boy here on my own bus.

40:48.100 --> 40:49.700
Especially one with deer antlers.

40:51.220 --> 40:52.420
What a bold choice.

40:52.420 --> 40:55.820
Traditionally goats have what we like to call horns.

40:55.820 --> 40:56.820
You can wear a shirt that says,

40:56.820 --> 40:58.420
ask me about my pocket watch.

41:00.180 --> 41:01.940
And then when they ask you, you be like,

41:01.940 --> 41:03.020
I don't know, watch.

41:03.020 --> 41:04.180
What are you talking about?

41:04.180 --> 41:05.020
What are you talking about?

41:05.020 --> 41:05.860
They'll be so confused.

41:05.860 --> 41:06.700
They're like, I was going to ask that guy

41:06.700 --> 41:08.500
about his antlers, but nevermind.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.500
He seems like a bit of a pill.

41:10.500 --> 41:13.820
I'd hate for this to be another pocket watch situation.

41:17.020 --> 41:20.420
Our show is funny and good and everyone's lucky to be here.

41:20.420 --> 41:21.620
Okay.

41:21.620 --> 41:23.580
So weird regular thing.

41:23.580 --> 41:25.780
So a regular thing you're doing.

41:25.780 --> 41:28.020
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

41:28.020 --> 41:33.020
Folks, it's a haunt.

41:37.220 --> 41:38.380
This just came across.

41:38.380 --> 41:40.300
Travis, thank you for seeing that.

41:40.300 --> 41:41.700
This just came across my desk.

41:41.700 --> 41:42.980
It's a haunted doll watch.

41:45.340 --> 41:46.180
Sorry.

41:47.940 --> 41:50.940
Honestly, guys, I'm as surprised as you are.

41:50.940 --> 41:53.700
Haunted doll, Khloe Kardashian lookalike.

41:53.700 --> 41:55.180
Wait, sorry, wait, what?

41:55.180 --> 41:56.020
What?

41:56.020 --> 41:57.980
Shh, shh.

41:57.980 --> 42:01.820
Haunted doll, Khloe Kardashian lookalike, succubus entity,

42:01.820 --> 42:04.780
sexual spirit, nympho, nymphomania.

42:05.860 --> 42:06.700
Huh?

42:06.700 --> 42:08.100
Just what it says on the eBay list.

42:08.100 --> 42:09.620
And guys, I don't know what to tell you.

42:09.620 --> 42:12.820
Haunted doll, Khloe Kardashian lookalike, succubus entity,

42:12.820 --> 42:14.860
sexual spirit, nympho, nymphomania.

42:17.020 --> 42:19.100
This doll resembles Khloe Kardashian

42:19.100 --> 42:22.420
and is haunted by the spirit of Khloe, as she calls herself.

42:22.420 --> 42:23.580
What are the odds?

42:23.580 --> 42:24.820
How convenient.

42:24.820 --> 42:28.340
Khloe was a huge fan of reality TV star and spent-

42:28.340 --> 42:29.820
Huge fun?

42:29.820 --> 42:32.500
I'm just reading the listing.

42:32.500 --> 42:35.140
Was a huge fan of reality TV star

42:35.140 --> 42:39.260
and spent thousands on cosmetic procedures to look like her.

42:39.260 --> 42:40.260
You heard it.

42:41.340 --> 42:45.100
Huge fan of reality TV star, period.

42:45.100 --> 42:46.020
And spent-

42:48.380 --> 42:52.420
Was the cosmetic work before or after the dollining?

42:52.420 --> 42:55.740
If I could just read the next sentence-

42:55.740 --> 42:57.060
That's dumb, Griffin,

42:57.060 --> 42:59.660
because there's no way it costs thousands of dollars

42:59.660 --> 43:00.980
to paint a doll.

43:00.980 --> 43:03.500
I just want to say that she died

43:03.500 --> 43:06.260
due to complications arising from plastic surgery.

43:06.260 --> 43:07.100
Yeah.

43:07.100 --> 43:07.940
Oh.

43:09.260 --> 43:11.220
But not really, because it's fake.

43:11.220 --> 43:12.060
Travis.

43:12.060 --> 43:13.660
Her looks helped her become

43:13.660 --> 43:16.180
a successful high-end escort in Las Vegas.

43:17.580 --> 43:20.860
Khloe says it took a long time

43:20.860 --> 43:22.660
to find the right vessel,

43:22.660 --> 43:24.100
but she's happy with her choice

43:24.100 --> 43:27.380
and finally feeling like her true self, a doll.

43:27.380 --> 43:28.700
I guess.

43:28.700 --> 43:30.780
She loves to be the center of attention.

43:32.300 --> 43:34.260
When you give her all of your attention,

43:34.260 --> 43:36.660
she will shower you with affection.

43:36.660 --> 43:37.860
Is that good?

43:37.860 --> 43:40.180
It isn't hard to get along with this spirit.

43:40.180 --> 43:43.860
All she asks is that you are real with her.

43:45.740 --> 43:48.500
Hey, Tony, cut the shit, okay?

43:48.500 --> 43:49.940
Hey, hey.

43:49.940 --> 43:50.980
It's me.

43:50.980 --> 43:52.380
It's Khloe, man.

43:52.380 --> 43:53.740
Be honest.

43:53.740 --> 43:56.700
Oh, when you get her,

43:56.700 --> 43:59.500
don't forget to give her a gift of something girly,

43:59.500 --> 44:01.820
maybe something to do with fashion and beauty.

44:03.540 --> 44:07.540
Doll is 16 inches tall, comes with a stand, smoke-free.

44:08.540 --> 44:09.860
Smoke-free?

44:09.860 --> 44:10.860
Oh, okay.

44:10.860 --> 44:13.500
The household where the doll came from was smoke-free.

44:13.500 --> 44:14.820
You're going to.

44:16.140 --> 44:18.700
As I'm required by eBay's policy on the paranormal

44:18.700 --> 44:21.100
to indicate that eBay forbids the sale of intangible items

44:21.100 --> 44:22.660
in this listing is only for a tangible doll

44:22.660 --> 44:23.500
with no promises for the attached.

44:23.500 --> 44:24.340
Wait, why?

44:24.340 --> 44:25.620
Wait, why?

44:25.620 --> 44:27.780
Why is this shot included?

44:27.780 --> 44:28.900
Shh, shh.

44:28.900 --> 44:30.100
So you can see the ass.

44:32.100 --> 44:33.900
It's for entertainment purposes only.

44:33.900 --> 44:35.660
But no, wait, friends.

44:35.660 --> 44:37.060
I don't just have one doll for you.

44:37.060 --> 44:38.180
I have two dolls for you.

44:38.180 --> 44:39.380
I have another doll.

44:39.380 --> 44:40.580
But wait.

44:40.580 --> 44:42.540
This next doll is named Kim.

44:42.540 --> 44:43.540
Thank you, Khloe.

44:43.540 --> 44:45.580
Thank you for your service.

44:45.580 --> 44:48.140
Oh, fuck no.

44:48.140 --> 44:49.940
Oh, that, that's B.

44:49.940 --> 44:51.340
I'm Khloe's friend.

44:52.580 --> 44:55.500
Haunted doll, spirit vessel, negative entity,

44:55.500 --> 44:56.740
dark presence.

44:57.820 --> 44:59.780
I go everywhere Khloe goes.

44:59.780 --> 45:01.780
I'm Khloe B.

45:01.780 --> 45:03.220
Do you want a kiss?

45:03.220 --> 45:05.020
This is, this is B.

45:05.020 --> 45:06.900
Khloe and I have to be home by 10.

45:06.900 --> 45:08.420
She can't stay.

45:08.420 --> 45:09.420
This is B.

45:09.420 --> 45:10.700
B's vessel is pretty.

45:10.700 --> 45:14.260
An unusual vintage small bisque doll in good condition.

45:14.260 --> 45:15.660
Bisque?

45:15.660 --> 45:16.580
In good, I don't,

45:16.580 --> 45:18.820
I'm not going to decode the doll stuff, Travis.

45:18.820 --> 45:20.380
In good condition for its age.

45:20.380 --> 45:21.980
This doll's full of soup.

45:21.980 --> 45:26.740
But with some signs of age and where to be expected.

45:26.740 --> 45:28.740
B is a dark and confused spirit.

45:28.740 --> 45:31.580
She came to me recently in spirit form only

45:31.580 --> 45:34.140
and was causing much disruption to my electricity.

45:35.460 --> 45:36.780
Hence the lighting.

45:38.220 --> 45:39.460
She's a lost spirit.

45:39.460 --> 45:41.860
And to help her, I found this vessel for her to take over

45:41.860 --> 45:43.140
as these do help spirits,

45:43.140 --> 45:44.940
which cannot pass to the other realm,

45:44.940 --> 45:46.980
to find some form of comfort or grounding.

45:46.980 --> 45:47.820
Yeah.

45:47.820 --> 45:49.340
Why is this the doll you put me in?

45:49.340 --> 45:51.260
I'm sure that spirit is stoked.

45:54.580 --> 45:56.500
I said no pictures.

45:56.500 --> 45:59.940
We have communicated with B via Ouija and dowsing rods.

46:01.340 --> 46:02.780
She was a farmer's wife.

46:02.780 --> 46:04.180
You've been doing what?

46:05.820 --> 46:10.300
She was a farmer's wife and advises that she died of quote,

46:10.300 --> 46:11.140
poison.

46:11.140 --> 46:15.140
Travis, can you confirm there is,

46:15.140 --> 46:17.500
there are quotes on the word poison?

46:17.500 --> 46:18.740
Correct.

46:18.740 --> 46:20.860
When she was 43.

46:20.860 --> 46:22.780
That does sound like the poster is like,

46:22.780 --> 46:25.100
she's obviously lying.

46:25.100 --> 46:29.540
Whilst we have not yet got to the bottom

46:29.540 --> 46:31.580
of how she ingested poison,

46:31.580 --> 46:34.180
we know her death was very unpleasant.

46:34.180 --> 46:35.020
Yay.

46:36.740 --> 46:38.660
Hey, how'd you die B?

46:38.660 --> 46:39.500
Poison.

46:39.500 --> 46:40.340
How?

46:40.340 --> 46:41.180
No.

46:42.540 --> 46:45.700
She says that she is buried quote, in the field.

46:47.340 --> 46:49.420
And that she cannot sleep.

46:49.420 --> 46:51.180
There's much work to be done with B

46:51.180 --> 46:52.940
and many things to be discovered.

46:52.940 --> 46:54.300
We'd like to find her new keeper,

46:54.300 --> 46:55.980
someone who can work with her to find out her story.

46:55.980 --> 46:58.220
She will disrupt electricity

46:58.220 --> 47:00.460
by way of interfering with the picture on the TV.

47:00.460 --> 47:01.820
House spirits love to do this.

47:01.820 --> 47:03.100
That's a different doll.

47:04.020 --> 47:07.460
And bulbs may go in usually quickly in succession,

47:07.460 --> 47:10.380
which we all know if you've been watching.

47:10.380 --> 47:14.340
She has eyes that will follow you around the room

47:14.340 --> 47:16.740
and at times her presence can be quite overwhelming

47:16.740 --> 47:17.780
and chilling.

47:17.780 --> 47:19.700
Enhance.

47:19.700 --> 47:23.120
Why do I see a reflection of myself asleep in her eyes?

47:24.460 --> 47:26.300
Anyway, it says this has all been lies

47:26.300 --> 47:28.300
and it makes him say it's a lie.

47:28.300 --> 47:29.900
How much?

47:29.900 --> 47:31.300
Paul, can you pull up the listing?

47:31.300 --> 47:33.700
I don't have the, I don't know where it's at right now.

47:33.700 --> 47:34.740
It's great.

47:34.740 --> 47:36.340
It just jumped up significantly.

47:36.340 --> 47:37.900
I would wager in the last five minutes.

47:37.900 --> 47:39.820
Great, great British pounds.

47:39.820 --> 47:42.140
Wait, raise your hand if you bit on this dog.

47:42.140 --> 47:43.980
Oh my God, okay.

47:43.980 --> 47:44.820
There are a couple.

47:44.820 --> 47:46.340
Justin posted this listing.

47:47.500 --> 47:49.340
I should, that would be a good grift.

47:49.340 --> 47:50.180
Yeah, right?

47:50.180 --> 47:51.620
I don't know where we're going.

47:51.620 --> 47:52.700
And then they were arrested

47:52.700 --> 47:55.580
on the weirdest insider trading charges ever.

47:55.580 --> 47:57.220
She can be quite rude at times,

47:57.220 --> 48:00.140
sometimes not talk or communicate at all

48:00.140 --> 48:01.460
or just swear.

48:02.980 --> 48:05.580
So she won't talk for you a few days

48:05.580 --> 48:07.460
and then from your weird doll closet,

48:07.460 --> 48:12.460
you'll just hear, shit, bastard.

48:14.140 --> 48:16.900
I'm in the fucking field.

48:16.900 --> 48:19.060
I'm not going to tell you how I was poisoned.

48:19.060 --> 48:20.260
Get off my case.

48:21.340 --> 48:22.940
That's my business.

48:25.940 --> 48:27.660
Refresh it, refresh it, Justin.

48:27.660 --> 48:28.500
We have to get it somebody big.

48:28.500 --> 48:30.100
I can't refresh, I'm not controlling it.

48:30.100 --> 48:30.940
Yay!

48:30.940 --> 48:32.260
Yay!

48:34.460 --> 48:37.100
It's 69, folks, we did it.

48:40.860 --> 48:43.740
Boy, that was a very great doll.

48:45.100 --> 48:45.980
Throughout the pandemic,

48:45.980 --> 48:47.660
I've really been trying to work on my physical fitness.

48:47.660 --> 48:48.660
I'm also an avid golfer.

48:48.660 --> 48:52.220
My fiance said she wanted me to take thirst pics

48:52.220 --> 48:54.260
out on the golf course.

48:54.260 --> 48:57.500
Fellas, how do I take sexy pictures on a golf course?

48:57.500 --> 48:59.140
You've come to the right place.

48:59.140 --> 49:02.100
Put your balls in the hole.

49:03.900 --> 49:05.100
That, I'm going to,

49:07.700 --> 49:11.620
there are like four different angles

49:11.620 --> 49:15.020
on why that was a bad joke.

49:15.020 --> 49:17.420
Which one will you be exploring first, Griffin?

49:20.020 --> 49:24.780
Both the metaphor of that image.

49:24.780 --> 49:25.860
First of all, okay,

49:25.860 --> 49:30.860
if you put your balls in the cup hole,

49:30.980 --> 49:34.180
the hole that you try to get the golf ball in,

49:34.180 --> 49:36.780
it would be hard to see, I think, what you're doing.

49:36.780 --> 49:39.340
Well, it's a look on your face that sells it.

49:39.340 --> 49:40.180
They would just be like,

49:40.180 --> 49:42.460
why is he laying down on the golf course?

49:42.460 --> 49:43.780
But you would have a look on your face.

49:43.780 --> 49:45.500
It's like, what, me worry?

49:45.500 --> 49:46.340
Right.

49:47.340 --> 49:48.580
I'm a bad little boy.

49:48.580 --> 49:49.580
I'm a stinker kind of face.

49:49.580 --> 49:50.780
Yeah, I'm a stinker.

49:50.780 --> 49:52.060
But I also don't know that-

49:52.060 --> 49:53.620
That's a thirst trap, right?

49:53.620 --> 49:54.980
Yeah.

49:54.980 --> 49:56.980
I also don't know if it's like,

49:56.980 --> 49:59.380
even if it was very literal,

49:59.380 --> 50:00.820
especially sexy to say,

50:00.820 --> 50:03.060
I'm going to put my balls in the hole.

50:04.300 --> 50:07.260
Oh my, promise?

50:11.260 --> 50:14.220
You can do the thirst trap and then the sand trap.

50:14.220 --> 50:15.180
Yeah, that's a good one.

50:15.180 --> 50:17.740
Those are two words that sound alike.

50:18.820 --> 50:21.500
So I said, I don't really have a follow up.

50:22.660 --> 50:24.260
I just wanted to say that.

50:24.260 --> 50:25.340
Could you lift a golf-

50:25.340 --> 50:27.460
Can you guys do something?

50:27.460 --> 50:30.860
Can you lift a golf cart over your fucking head?

50:30.860 --> 50:31.700
Yeah.

50:33.020 --> 50:34.380
That's the end of my joke.

50:37.020 --> 50:38.900
Now I'm still going with balls in the hole.

50:38.900 --> 50:39.740
All right.

50:41.900 --> 50:45.100
Could you do a hole in one in a picture?

50:47.340 --> 50:49.700
Is there such a thing as a thirst gif?

50:49.700 --> 50:50.540
Yeah.

50:53.900 --> 50:55.100
Maybe just like a nice,

50:55.100 --> 50:56.900
like if you're playing at like sunset,

50:56.900 --> 50:58.740
just a nice picture you smiling.

51:00.340 --> 51:02.020
Maybe like a knowing smile.

51:02.020 --> 51:04.220
Hey, I got a story to tell you when I get home.

51:04.220 --> 51:06.700
I just got my balls out of the hole.

51:06.700 --> 51:07.540
I want to give credit-

51:07.540 --> 51:08.380
I want to give credit-

51:08.380 --> 51:09.500
Where are my balls then?

51:09.500 --> 51:10.540
I'll never tell.

51:10.540 --> 51:14.500
I'm being forcibly removed from the golf course.

51:14.500 --> 51:16.540
Can you guess why?

51:16.540 --> 51:19.140
That's right, I've done it again.

51:19.140 --> 51:21.580
We have to move cities.

51:25.500 --> 51:26.340
I want to give-

51:26.340 --> 51:28.220
I need you to take me to the emergency room

51:28.220 --> 51:29.620
because I put the balls in the hole,

51:29.620 --> 51:31.700
but someone played through.

51:34.900 --> 51:37.380
I want to give quick credit to this question asker

51:37.380 --> 51:39.500
because they must have thought for so long

51:39.500 --> 51:41.860
before landing on throughout the pandemic,

51:41.860 --> 51:44.540
I've really been trying to work on my physical fitness.

51:44.540 --> 51:46.220
Do you know how many times there was a little like,

51:46.220 --> 51:47.540
I'm fucking cut.

51:47.540 --> 51:52.060
I look fucking good and everybody loves it.

51:52.060 --> 51:54.580
Look at these fucking abs.

51:54.580 --> 51:58.500
Fucking sexy and swollen, everybody loves it.

51:58.500 --> 52:00.100
Help me, sad brothers.

52:03.220 --> 52:04.860
Help me, doe siblings.

52:04.860 --> 52:06.340
What can I do?

52:06.340 --> 52:07.460
They actually wrote here,

52:07.460 --> 52:09.620
and don't say put your balls in the hole.

52:10.540 --> 52:12.820
It's like, don't tell us how to do our job.

52:12.820 --> 52:13.660
Right.

52:14.460 --> 52:17.100
Maybe you could just like pretend to hump the windmill.

52:17.100 --> 52:17.940
That's fun.

52:17.940 --> 52:20.620
Yeah, cause it's definitely a mini golf course.

52:22.300 --> 52:23.900
Wait, there are other ones?

52:24.780 --> 52:27.060
Yeah, they make these boring ass golf courses

52:27.060 --> 52:28.700
where you have to hit the ball wicked hard

52:28.700 --> 52:29.540
before you get to the fun stuff.

52:29.540 --> 52:30.380
Major golf courses.

52:30.380 --> 52:32.020
Major golf, yes.

52:32.020 --> 52:33.100
Macro golf.

52:35.060 --> 52:36.300
This is actually very awkward,

52:36.300 --> 52:38.300
but can I run to the restroom real quick?

52:38.300 --> 52:39.140
You guys got this?

52:39.140 --> 52:40.300
Thank you.

52:40.300 --> 52:42.100
Okay, I mean, there's another question.

52:42.100 --> 52:44.940
Hey, Paul, could I have another beer?

52:44.940 --> 52:48.740
Thank you, audience, for confirming that I can.

52:48.740 --> 52:50.780
Hey, give it up for Paul.

52:55.780 --> 52:57.460
And Paul, can you check on Justin?

52:57.460 --> 52:59.220
He's been in the bathroom for a really long time

52:59.220 --> 53:00.660
and I'm worried about him.

53:00.660 --> 53:03.460
Can we say a big thanks to the Sheridan Grand Seattle?

53:05.460 --> 53:08.420
A beautiful hotel that I love.

53:08.420 --> 53:10.660
I've stayed here for a really long time.

53:10.660 --> 53:13.260
I've stayed here a few times

53:13.260 --> 53:15.380
and I hold it so near and dear in my heart

53:15.380 --> 53:17.180
because it's the only hotel I ever stayed in

53:17.180 --> 53:20.460
that's fucking across the street from a Cheesecake Factory.

53:23.740 --> 53:25.220
Also, very exciting.

53:25.220 --> 53:27.500
Let's give a big cheer for Rachel, our editor.

53:27.500 --> 53:28.340
Yeah.

53:28.340 --> 53:31.980
This is the first time that Rachel has been here

53:31.980 --> 53:33.140
to actually help run the show

53:33.140 --> 53:34.180
so we don't have to worry about it.

53:34.180 --> 53:35.220
And it's huge.

53:35.220 --> 53:36.340
Thank you, Rachel.

53:36.340 --> 53:38.060
And to Amanda and Danielle

53:38.060 --> 53:40.380
and to everybody who's helped us do this show this evening.

53:40.380 --> 53:42.060
And my wife, Rachel.

53:42.060 --> 53:43.340
And my wife, Teresa.

53:43.340 --> 53:47.620
And our kids and our dad and Paul Soborin.

53:47.620 --> 53:49.060
I don't think Justin's ever coming back.

53:49.060 --> 53:50.740
I think that's entirely possible.

54:04.900 --> 54:05.740
Oh, God.

54:05.740 --> 54:07.060
Justin, I mean, Richard.

54:07.060 --> 54:12.060
Richard, no, Richard.

54:17.460 --> 54:18.740
Hi, everybody.

54:18.740 --> 54:20.860
It's a good thing Richard isn't sharing a room

54:20.860 --> 54:22.780
with anyone this week.

54:22.780 --> 54:24.660
Yeah, Richard's flying solo.

54:24.660 --> 54:26.620
Wow, some people smelled it even there

54:26.620 --> 54:27.940
and they wave it away.

54:29.340 --> 54:31.300
They wave a smell away.

54:31.300 --> 54:37.540
It's like a fucking Gallagher show in here.

54:37.540 --> 54:39.660
Oh, my God, I can taste it.

54:39.660 --> 54:40.500
Through the mask.

54:40.500 --> 54:41.860
I'm right next to Richard.

54:41.860 --> 54:44.460
Hey, guys, it's so cool to be here.

54:44.460 --> 54:48.860
They're already starting with the jokes, these cut-ups.

54:48.860 --> 54:50.180
But it's like...

54:50.180 --> 54:51.820
Hey, Richard, was there a point halfway

54:51.820 --> 54:53.540
through spraying yourself 19 times

54:53.540 --> 54:54.860
that you thought, this is too much?

54:54.860 --> 54:58.820
No, there was a point where I thought, this is not enough.

54:58.820 --> 55:00.300
I need 20 more sprays,

55:00.300 --> 55:03.380
but I'm running out of music.

55:03.380 --> 55:05.580
Yeah, so it's so cool to be here with you guys.

55:05.580 --> 55:07.620
You made my beard taste like it, Richard.

55:07.620 --> 55:09.620
I'd like to talk.

55:09.620 --> 55:11.460
When I heard you guys were doing a live show,

55:11.460 --> 55:15.140
I was like, yes.

55:15.140 --> 55:19.180
I got to get there because I love comics.

55:19.180 --> 55:19.900
Yeah.

55:19.900 --> 55:21.220
You do?

55:21.220 --> 55:24.940
Yeah, I'm like a total, total nerd about this stuff, man.

55:24.940 --> 55:25.460
I love it.

55:25.460 --> 55:29.380
Who's your favorite superhero?

55:29.380 --> 55:32.580
Don't make me choose.

55:32.580 --> 55:33.780
You can say, like, five or six.

55:33.780 --> 55:35.620
Just anyone, yeah.

55:35.620 --> 55:39.380
Red...

55:39.380 --> 55:40.300
Villain?

55:40.300 --> 55:41.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:41.740 --> 55:42.940
You guys have him over here?

55:42.940 --> 55:44.380
Your favorite superhero is Red Villain.

55:44.380 --> 55:45.540
Red Falcon.

55:45.540 --> 55:46.060
Falcon.

55:46.060 --> 55:47.740
I misspoke, yeah.

55:47.740 --> 55:48.900
Red Falcon.

55:48.900 --> 55:50.860
I actually don't know if that's the one.

55:50.860 --> 55:53.540
Okay, these guys know they're geeks and nerds.

55:53.540 --> 55:55.540
They love it.

55:55.540 --> 55:57.860
So what I want to do, right, because it's not winter yet,

55:57.860 --> 55:59.860
normally I'm only allowed to come once a season,

55:59.860 --> 56:02.820
which is like, I hope you don't like ratings, you know?

56:02.820 --> 56:04.300
Yeah, man.

56:04.300 --> 56:08.340
I wanted to talk about, like, some superhero fragrances.

56:08.340 --> 56:10.740
Because I don't know if you know this, it's, like, not a joke,

56:10.740 --> 56:13.500
but there's, like, there's a lot of them.

56:13.500 --> 56:15.460
It's, like, a weird number.

56:15.460 --> 56:18.900
If you Google later, not now, but these are, like, all real.

56:18.900 --> 56:19.820
And I love them.

56:19.820 --> 56:22.380
And they've been really good for me.

56:22.380 --> 56:24.140
Fucking compliment machines, man.

56:24.140 --> 56:25.220
Whoa, hey, Richard.

56:25.220 --> 56:26.140
You get out there.

56:26.140 --> 56:29.860
You spray them, people are like, yes.

56:29.860 --> 56:31.180
Here's the first one I got.

56:31.180 --> 56:32.660
I wanted to try on you guys.

56:32.660 --> 56:33.500
No.

56:33.500 --> 56:34.420
Try on us?

56:34.420 --> 56:37.700
Yeah, it's just, like, yeah, this one is...

56:37.700 --> 56:39.620
I do like that it came out of a capsule.

56:39.620 --> 56:40.460
I do actually like that.

56:40.460 --> 56:41.500
That's cool, right?

56:41.500 --> 56:43.500
It's like a gamma rays.

56:43.500 --> 56:44.340
Um...

56:44.340 --> 56:48.220
You're fucking great, Richard.

56:49.460 --> 56:53.180
This first one is for, this first one is Spider-Man.

56:53.180 --> 56:54.700
Sorry?

56:54.700 --> 56:58.060
This first one is Spider-Man.

56:58.060 --> 57:02.460
Uh, this is, it says here, the web king is back

57:02.460 --> 57:04.140
with his great original smell.

57:04.140 --> 57:05.700
Notes of Vetiver Berry.

57:05.700 --> 57:06.700
Can I see it?

57:06.700 --> 57:07.980
The web king?

57:07.980 --> 57:09.180
The web king is back.

57:09.180 --> 57:10.940
Can I read where it says that?

57:10.940 --> 57:13.380
The web king is back with his original smell.

57:13.380 --> 57:14.460
The nose on this.

57:14.460 --> 57:15.980
Can I read where it says that, Richard?

57:15.980 --> 57:17.820
Do you guys know the nose on this one?

57:17.820 --> 57:19.500
Is it Spider-Web?

57:19.500 --> 57:20.940
Spider-Web?

57:21.820 --> 57:23.740
No, it's, the nose, the Korean.

57:23.740 --> 57:25.900
No, you're thinking of notes.

57:25.900 --> 57:26.740
Right.

57:26.740 --> 57:29.100
The nose, like that person who made the smell.

57:29.100 --> 57:31.460
Oh, it's Andrew Garfield.

57:31.460 --> 57:33.020
No, correct.

57:33.020 --> 57:33.860
Wait.

57:34.900 --> 57:35.980
Mixed message.

57:35.980 --> 57:36.820
Grib?

57:36.820 --> 57:37.660
Gribbert?

57:40.820 --> 57:41.740
Gribbert!

57:41.740 --> 57:43.260
Yeah, sorry, sorry.

57:43.260 --> 57:45.420
I was, I just, I love.

57:45.420 --> 57:46.900
The nose on Spider-Man.

57:46.900 --> 57:48.300
Everyone knows, they all know it.

57:48.300 --> 57:49.740
Don't get, don't give it to them.

57:49.740 --> 57:50.740
Oh, yeah.

57:50.740 --> 57:52.060
Hugo.

57:52.060 --> 57:54.180
It's Spider-Man.

57:54.180 --> 57:56.300
He did the scent himself.

57:56.300 --> 57:58.580
I do want to take a close look at that.

57:58.580 --> 58:00.540
Through the mask, he did it.

58:00.540 --> 58:03.100
It's notes, I'll give, I'll do like one small smell.

58:03.100 --> 58:03.940
No!

58:03.940 --> 58:05.100
Because you guys know, all right,

58:05.100 --> 58:06.540
we're going to pass on that.

58:06.540 --> 58:09.140
But this one's Spider-Man, it's like notes of vetiver

58:09.140 --> 58:11.620
and some wood and oak and Spider-Man's the nose

58:11.620 --> 58:14.900
and he loves it and his wife Mary Jane loves it too.

58:14.900 --> 58:16.060
They all love it.

58:16.060 --> 58:17.300
Does it smell like Spider-Man?

58:17.300 --> 58:18.500
I have to smell it.

58:18.500 --> 58:19.820
Can I hold it in my hand?

58:19.820 --> 58:20.820
Yeah, you can just smell it.

58:20.820 --> 58:22.660
Give me quick, just quick thoughts.

58:22.660 --> 58:23.740
Give me quick thoughts on that.

58:23.740 --> 58:26.060
It's just that there's no branding on it.

58:26.060 --> 58:27.500
Sample bottles.

58:27.500 --> 58:31.340
Your TSA, if I can say this here,

58:31.340 --> 58:33.460
I don't know if we're a mixed company,

58:33.460 --> 58:36.140
your TSA won't even let me bring my seven ounce bottle

58:36.140 --> 58:38.100
of Spider-Man cologne.

58:38.100 --> 58:41.300
They take it out, they say, this is too big.

58:41.300 --> 58:42.580
I say, I'll check it.

58:44.300 --> 58:46.460
But I think that doesn't even spot back in my pocket.

58:46.460 --> 58:49.140
They get very like, you know how this does.

58:49.140 --> 58:51.140
Give it a quick smell.

58:51.140 --> 58:53.100
No, it's just a Spider-Man cologne.

58:53.100 --> 58:53.940
That's not bad.

58:53.940 --> 58:56.940
Yeah, it's like got notes of vetiver and almonds.

58:56.940 --> 58:58.060
Did you say notes of venom?

58:58.060 --> 58:59.940
Next up is Superman.

59:01.140 --> 59:03.460
Clark Kent is back, it says here.

59:03.460 --> 59:04.300
Clark Kent is back.

59:04.300 --> 59:05.580
Where was he?

59:05.580 --> 59:06.900
Clark Kent is back from the dead

59:06.900 --> 59:10.540
with a new smell that'll wake up the sexual animal in you.

59:10.540 --> 59:12.140
What?

59:12.140 --> 59:14.460
Why does it say this?

59:14.460 --> 59:18.140
Known sexual animal, Clark Kent.

59:18.140 --> 59:19.820
Clark Kent is back with a new-

59:19.820 --> 59:23.420
Known boner machine, Clark Kent.

59:23.420 --> 59:25.140
Do you guys know the nose on this one?

59:25.140 --> 59:26.300
Is it Clark Kent?

59:26.300 --> 59:28.460
No, it's Paul Lagartier.

59:28.460 --> 59:29.660
You guys don't know this?

59:29.660 --> 59:31.300
Paul Lagartier is the nose on this.

59:31.300 --> 59:33.860
He put in notes of, let me hit, like-

59:33.860 --> 59:35.700
Yeah, spray it right up your nose.

59:36.980 --> 59:38.860
Oh, no!

59:38.860 --> 59:39.900
No, he didn't!

59:39.900 --> 59:41.420
Fresh.

59:41.420 --> 59:43.420
Oh, God, it's bleeding.

59:43.420 --> 59:47.820
It's like, how you doing over there, Richard?

59:47.820 --> 59:49.860
It's like, it's challenging.

59:49.860 --> 59:51.820
It is challenging.

59:51.820 --> 59:52.660
Right?

59:52.660 --> 59:53.620
It's like-

59:53.620 --> 59:55.260
When you do it like that, Richard,

59:55.260 --> 59:57.620
it's like everyone's wearing Superman cologne.

59:57.620 --> 59:59.540
Yeah, where it's like-

59:59.540 --> 01:00:00.540
It's kind of like-

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:01.580
How did he go?

01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:03.740
Well, just like he wanted to.

01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:05.860
It's got almond in it.

01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:07.820
You can tell-

01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:09.740
It sounds like melting brain.

01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:14.460
There's some blood.

01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:16.500
I want to move on to Iron Man.

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:19.860
Wait, just a kind of related question.

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:22.740
When Superman did get killed by Doomsday,

01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:24.820
I think, in that comic series,

01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:26.700
was there a following comic where people were like,

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:28.180
where's fucking Clark?

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:29.500
Has anyone seen Clark lately?

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:30.340
No, they covered it

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:32.980
because Supergirl pretended to be Clark Kent.

01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:34.700
Okay, ask and answer.

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:36.860
Thank you, Travis.

01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:39.060
Can I tell you about Iron Man?

01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:40.380
I'd love to hear about Iron Man.

01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:43.220
This is a robot that everyone's wild about.

01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:46.220
He's a world's-

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:47.060
It says on here,

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:50.300
the world's richest robot is back.

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:52.700
Why is he always back?

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:55.420
It says the world's richest robot is back.

01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:56.260
Yeah.

01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:57.300
And everyone's favorite,

01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:00.580
the nose on this is also Jean-Paul Leclete-Radier.

01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:01.980
I swear to Christ,

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:04.220
you put some new syllables in there.

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:06.300
You put a steak on there, Richard.

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:07.580
This one is like-

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:12.060
I mean, like I smell this and I think money.

01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:13.420
I think robots.

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:14.780
I think rich robots.

01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:16.260
I think Iron Man smells-

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:17.860
Do you want to take a little whiff, Gribber?

01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:19.580
Do you also, yeah.

01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:21.860
Do you also think it smells like the last cologne

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:23.020
that you just sprayed up your nose?

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:24.020
Just get like a little-

01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:25.940
Do you smell the spice though?

01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:28.980
It's like a spicy Iron Man sort of rich robot, right?

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:30.980
It does kind of smell like motor oil, yeah.

01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:32.580
They love this at my church, man.

01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:34.260
They go crazy for it.

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:35.900
Oh yeah, how was your walk?

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:36.740
Stronger than everybody.

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:39.020
I noticed your necklace there.

01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:40.300
Is that a religious symbol?

01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:41.380
I did it for the geeks.

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:42.380
Like they love this.

01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:43.980
It's never ending story.

01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:45.500
What does it say on the back?

01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:49.060
Right, this free with purchase.

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:54.380
Now my man Clint bought this for me on the show floor.

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:55.220
Thanks, Clint.

01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:57.340
Well, you said like I had to leave my crucifix at home.

01:01:57.340 --> 01:01:59.460
Clint, will you grab me a crucifix?

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:01.260
And what your man Clint came back with was-

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:04.540
Was the orange from Little Shop of Monsters.

01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:05.380
What was it?

01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:08.260
Never ending story.

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:09.820
Did you smell that, Gribber?

01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:11.700
Did you spray it on you?

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:14.300
Did he, I didn't see him, guys.

01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:15.260
Did he spray it on him?

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:16.100
Did he love it?

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:16.940
I did.

01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:17.780
What was his reaction?

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:18.620
Do the face.

01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:19.460
It was very non-plus.

01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:21.420
Why is everyone wearing a mask?

01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:23.220
What is happening?

01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:25.300
You can't smell any fragrances.

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:26.380
I'm sorry.

01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:27.660
Richard, sorry, come back.

01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:30.060
What?

01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:32.780
Still?

01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:36.700
What?

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:37.540
Yes.

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:40.740
Oh God.

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:41.940
That's so sad.

01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:44.580
Anyway, there's lots of other great ones.

01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:48.100
I got Black Manta.

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:48.940
Black Manta?

01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:49.980
They made a Black Manta one?

01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:51.860
Green Lantern.

01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:53.740
But anyway, that's all the fragrances I got.

01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:56.580
I feel like the three of us can just bring it home.

01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:57.420
Let's like wrap it up.

01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:58.260
Yeah, for sure.

01:02:58.260 --> 01:02:59.860
Justin's dead white, man.

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:01.580
We don't even need him around.

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:02.980
Yeah, man.

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:05.180
You did drop one on the floor and if it broke open,

01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:08.060
we would really never be invited back

01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:10.180
to Washington State.

01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:11.020
Wait, I have one.

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:12.900
No, no, no, I know that this one,

01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:15.060
it wasn't, because you know what superhero this is?

01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:15.900
What?

01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:16.740
Unbreakable.

01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:19.020
Richard, I know you're the guest here,

01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:22.620
but do you want to take a swing at thanking the audience

01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:23.620
and getting us some more?

01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:25.100
Yeah, man, thanks you.

01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:27.220
Thanks ABBA for the great music.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:28.180
No, well, Richard.

01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:31.940
Thanks to, I haven't listened for a bit, is it?

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:33.340
Yeah, no, no, no, I get that.

01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:35.260
No, it's actually Montaigne now.

01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:36.500
Oh, thanks Montaigne.

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:38.180
This is our first live show with that

01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:40.140
as our righteous theme song.

01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:43.820
Let me think.

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:46.660
Okay, me and Travis thanked most people

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:47.740
while Justin was being pretty killed.

01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:49.140
Did we thank our dad?

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:49.980
Yes.

01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:50.820
Thank you, Clint McElroy.

01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:51.660
Thank you, Clint McElroy.

01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:57.100
Sorry, I heard you goofing on John Cena.

01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:58.140
You want to say anything about him,

01:03:58.140 --> 01:03:59.620
like sorry or anything like that?

01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:01.820
No, not until he says it first.

01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:04.780
Fair, that's cool, yeah.

01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:10.420
Can you, Justin asked me through a mirror

01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:12.420
we use to talk to each other.

01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:14.140
Awesome, fuck yeah.

01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:19.180
We have a mirror we use to talk to each other?

01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:20.500
Definitely.

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:23.420
Everybody knows this, they all know this.

01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:26.300
I've actually heard, Richard, last time we met,

01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:29.380
you had like a really small knapsack

01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:33.060
that I could hear Justin screaming from.

01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:34.300
Was that that?

01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:38.620
Yeah, it's a huge mirror I keep with a small knapsack

01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:41.180
and it's got Justin, we talk to each other

01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:43.340
and it's just, that's all.

01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:45.180
And then he just told me to ask you,

01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:49.220
he said that you had, he'd sent a whip ass

01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:50.860
final Yahoo for us.

01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:51.700
Oh yeah.

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:56.780
From the final Yahoo answer, which is weird to me

01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:58.180
because it doesn't work anymore

01:04:58.180 --> 01:04:59.820
when I try to go to the site.

01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:00.660
Yeah.

01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:01.500
It's still in my RS.

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:02.340
Do you have your login?

01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:03.180
What?

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:04.860
Have you like updated your password for Yahoo?

01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:06.220
I, no, I do.

01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:07.060
That might be it.

01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:08.260
I do through a VPN.

01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:09.300
Oh, good call.

01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:10.140
Yeah.

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:11.500
Yeah, I've just actually left the tab open

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:13.540
for a while now.

01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:17.180
Yeah, I connect through a VPN at Paul Reiser's house.

01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:21.620
Cause I don't want my activity to be monitored.

01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:24.180
So I hack into Paul Reiser's internet

01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:27.300
and then I call my sites through there.

01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:29.380
Wait, so you do it at Paul Reiser's house?

01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:33.100
No, I hack into Paul Reiser's house.

01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:35.460
And let me tell you, he is mad about that.

01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:43.020
Griffin, I'm done with my Paul Reiser story.

01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:44.660
You can finish show.

01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:49.660
Oh, thanks to Jesus Christ, obviously.

01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:53.180
Without his love, none of us would be here.

01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:55.340
Huge big ups to JC.

01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:57.500
My walk with him has never been stronger.

01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:59.380
Please keep me in your heart and prayer.

01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:00.980
Griffin, bring us home.

01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:05.980
This final Yahoo was sent in by R.L. Stein.

01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:18.220
Thank you, Dr. Goosebumps.

01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:22.420
Please, that's just what they call him on the court.

01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:25.540
Thank you, Dr. Goosebumps.

01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:27.540
It's from Yahoo Answers.

01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:30.140
There's nothing I can say that would be as funny

01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:32.340
as anything Richard Stank has done

01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:33.900
since he crossed the threshold of this thing.

01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:36.140
Just being myself, just read the one

01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:36.980
that you have on the screen.

01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:40.220
Sure, this one was, it's a Yahoo Answers user.

01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:59.220
Don Sheena, Don, Don Sheena asks,

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:04.700
do you think there was a point where a manager

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:06.820
or someone said, should it be Gina?

01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:08.140
Cause of the jeans.

01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:10.140
Hurry, the people gotta go home.

01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:13.380
Sure, Don Sheena asks.

01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:16.140
My dad's the light guy, he says he wants to go home.

01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:16.980
Whoa.

01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:19.820
Hey, thank you, man.

01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:22.100
Thank you for the ride over here, dad.

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:22.940
Love you, I'll see you soon.

01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:25.140
Don Sheena, God, we've gone so long.

01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:26.620
Don Sheena asks.

01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:27.460
Yes.

01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:34.420
Don Sheena asks, does, does, fuck.

01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:37.620
Don Sheena asks.

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:40.260
Just read it.

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:45.260
Don Sheena, Don, Don Sheena asks, does,

01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:53.260
does, does muscle milk, does muscle milk make,

01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:58.220
does muscle milk make an invisibility potion flavor?

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:02.980
My name's Richard Stank.

01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:04.220
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:05.180
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:06.420
This has been My Brother, My Brother,

01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:08.940
make it your dad's square on the lips.

01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:10.940
It's better with you.

01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:18.860
My life, it's better, it's better with you.

01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:24.780
My life, it's better, it's better with you.

01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:30.780
Cause it's true, it's better, it's better with you.

01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:35.780
My life, it's better with you.
