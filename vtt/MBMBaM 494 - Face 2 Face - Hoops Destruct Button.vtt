00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:44.720
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna, just say, hey, I wanna.

00:44.720 --> 00:48.320
Hello, everybody, and welcome to my brother made an advice show for the modron era. I'm

00:48.320 --> 00:54.160
your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:54.160 --> 01:00.880
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

01:02.720 --> 01:09.840
Here is a list of the septuagenarians I've seen this week. Donald Fagan, David Crosby,

01:09.840 --> 01:15.440
anyway, here's my kids. Fucking best hype man in the biz.

01:15.440 --> 01:18.480
Hey, I'm gonna get the crowd all hot and ready for you.

01:18.480 --> 01:24.480
I saw Winslow's Steely Dan, that was pretty cool.

01:24.480 --> 01:29.360
I guess you guys aren't reeling in the years. 23 Skadoo.

01:31.840 --> 01:40.160
And here's my kids. Like the Chilean miners, we've reemerged here.

01:41.520 --> 01:46.160
We've been buried deep below the King's theater and now have reemerged here.

01:46.160 --> 01:47.840
That was a weird, why did we do that?

01:47.840 --> 01:53.360
I don't know, but it was beautiful down there. A lot of bodies, a weird amount of bodies.

01:54.960 --> 01:58.320
I found out something interesting today, guys. I have limits.

01:58.320 --> 02:00.480
I think I know what it might be.

02:00.480 --> 02:04.080
It is that I have limits. My passion for,

02:05.600 --> 02:09.760
I don't want to say bad things, but I guess bad things, the lower end of-

02:09.760 --> 02:11.120
Garbage things.

02:11.120 --> 02:13.360
Hurting yourself with questionable cuisine.

02:13.360 --> 02:20.000
The lower end of culture, I think, is well documented. Food culture, specifically cuisine.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.080
We're in Food City, right?

02:26.080 --> 02:28.560
Food City, USA.

02:28.560 --> 02:31.680
Great spots to eat, great spots to dine.

02:31.680 --> 02:34.720
I was like, ooh, I went to this great Italian place up in Harlem.

02:34.720 --> 02:38.320
Oh, that's one of the best ramen I've ever had in my life.

02:38.320 --> 02:41.040
The great wine list, you gotta check it out.

02:41.040 --> 02:42.960
Shrimp company and all the other-

02:42.960 --> 02:44.640
Wait, which one?

02:44.640 --> 02:47.040
Just the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company I went to today.

02:49.600 --> 02:53.360
I don't think I've heard of that one. Justin, can you give me a little bit of background?

02:53.360 --> 02:55.040
We had, it was very cold.

02:56.720 --> 03:01.200
Damn, dude. That's the first thing you got to lay down at Bubba Gump's feet.

03:02.480 --> 03:06.880
The one thing about it is, here's some good reasons to go there. It's very cold,

03:06.880 --> 03:12.320
and it is inside. The one thing you can say for Bubba Gump Shrimp Company is it is indoors.

03:12.320 --> 03:16.960
That's huge. I had two kids with me, and they were, you know, kids.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.040
And it was cold, so we went into Bubba Gump.

03:19.040 --> 03:25.440
Well, we were trying to choose between Bubba Gump Shrimp Company and Hard Rock Cafe, and I said-

03:25.440 --> 03:27.200
Oh, how can you choose?

03:27.200 --> 03:28.800
I know. I said Bubba Gump should be more-

03:28.800 --> 03:30.400
Oh, was Applebee's closed?

03:30.400 --> 03:31.680
Bubba Gump should be-

03:31.680 --> 03:34.160
Oh, there was a weight of the Olive Garden.

03:34.160 --> 03:37.840
The Olive Garden. I said it would be more hilarious, so I went there.

03:38.400 --> 03:42.000
Not realizing that in addition to getting material for my podcast,

03:42.000 --> 03:43.920
I would have to eat the food with my human body.

03:48.160 --> 03:53.200
Here's the thing. I'm not picky. This is law. This is settled law. I'm not a picky-

03:53.200 --> 03:57.600
It was bad, guys. I don't know how to say it, except the food was bad.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.400
The experience, though, was bad.

04:00.400 --> 04:07.200
There was- They have a sign on the table, and you can flip it, right?

04:07.200 --> 04:10.480
And if it's blue, it says, Run Forrest, Run.

04:10.480 --> 04:13.200
And that means the server can just go right on by.

04:13.200 --> 04:17.920
And if you need something, you flip it to red, and it says, Stop Forrest, Stop.

04:17.920 --> 04:23.200
And any server in the place will stop at your table to see what you need, except none of them care.

04:24.720 --> 04:29.040
I can flip that bastard back and forth. No one gave a solitary shit.

04:29.040 --> 04:32.640
Their magic shoes carry them right back to the break room.

04:32.640 --> 04:37.360
Right back. No one actually addressed any of my many needs.

04:38.320 --> 04:42.080
What I did enjoy was the table right next to us.

04:43.200 --> 04:49.120
Sydney kept nudging me, and there's a table of two middle-aged people

04:49.760 --> 04:54.880
sharing what appeared to be a bottle of wine they brought from home.

04:54.880 --> 05:00.000
That's very good.

05:00.880 --> 05:05.600
I'm pretty sure they didn't get it from Bubba Gump because it wasn't in a box.

05:06.560 --> 05:08.880
So it probably wasn't from there.

05:08.880 --> 05:10.640
But I was a little judgy at first.

05:10.640 --> 05:14.160
But then by the end of the meal, I was like, Fuck, I wish I'd drunk a half bottle of wine.

05:15.040 --> 05:18.160
Those people look like they're having the time of their lives.

05:18.160 --> 05:18.400
Right.

05:19.040 --> 05:23.280
We had peel and eat shrimp that we ordered,

05:23.280 --> 05:25.920
and I said, peel and eat shrimp.

05:25.920 --> 05:28.720
And you know what they said? Do you want spicier garlic?

05:29.680 --> 05:32.560
Excuse me? For my peel and eat shrimp?

05:32.560 --> 05:33.840
They brought them to the table.

05:33.840 --> 05:36.880
The tails and the legs and stuff were not there.

05:36.880 --> 05:38.560
The peeling had happened.

05:38.560 --> 05:40.320
So they were just, and eat shrimp.

05:40.320 --> 05:42.560
And eat. And here's the fun thing.

05:42.560 --> 05:44.640
All my job was to eat.

05:44.640 --> 05:54.240
And when I did my job, it tasted like bologna exactly.

05:54.240 --> 05:55.520
So it wasn't hilarious.

05:56.560 --> 06:00.400
I did do, maybe now, tragedy plus time, etc.

06:00.400 --> 06:00.880
Right.

06:00.880 --> 06:03.600
Tragedy plus time and pepsin equals comedy.

06:03.600 --> 06:06.720
Did it never really sink in while you're eating at this restaurant

06:06.720 --> 06:13.280
that you're dining at a themed restaurant named after Tom Hanks' dead friend from that one movie?

06:13.280 --> 06:16.080
When you first walk into this place, and we're not just going to talk about this.

06:16.080 --> 06:16.960
We'll talk about other things.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.800
But when you first walk into this place,

06:18.800 --> 06:24.320
there is a bench with a box of chocolates permanently adhered to it.

06:25.360 --> 06:29.840
And it's been 25 years since this fucking flick came out, guys.

06:30.480 --> 06:31.920
That's surreal.

06:31.920 --> 06:32.400
Yeah.

06:32.400 --> 06:35.440
Like, if I walk in there, I'm like, excuse me?

06:36.160 --> 06:38.160
Can we talk about your art selection?

06:38.160 --> 06:39.440
This is very strange.

06:39.440 --> 06:43.520
There are people of legal voting age who might now, for the first time,

06:43.520 --> 06:47.360
watch Forrest Gump and think, is this a movie based off that restaurant chain?

06:47.360 --> 06:47.600
Yeah.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.520
Based off that bad bologna restaurant?

06:52.400 --> 06:54.160
Hey, what if we do our thing, our usual thing?

06:54.160 --> 06:54.960
Yeah, can we talk about the...

06:54.960 --> 06:55.280
Yeah.

06:55.280 --> 06:55.920
Oh, yeah, why don't we...

06:58.880 --> 07:02.320
I want to start with a Yahoo from the Yahoo Answer Service.

07:05.600 --> 07:08.000
This first one was sent in by Emma Kant.

07:08.000 --> 07:08.800
Thank you, Emma.

07:08.800 --> 07:12.560
It's Yahoo Answers user Viv who asks,

07:14.480 --> 07:20.320
okay, how to quietly eat chips?

07:22.480 --> 07:24.880
I eat lunch in the quiet section of the library.

07:24.880 --> 07:26.960
How do I quietly eat my Lays?

07:26.960 --> 07:27.600
Double brag.

07:29.120 --> 07:30.160
The answer is obvious.

07:30.800 --> 07:31.520
Put it in your mouth.

07:32.080 --> 07:32.800
Close the mouth.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.120
Wait five minutes.

07:35.120 --> 07:36.720
Oh, God.

07:36.720 --> 07:38.880
I'm saying, it's not the pleasant answer.

07:38.880 --> 07:41.200
It's not the answer you choose to do.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.840
But if you're asking me how to quietly consume a chip,

07:43.840 --> 07:45.920
it is to let that bad boy dissolve in there.

07:45.920 --> 07:48.880
And then you just swallow it like a medicine pill.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.480
And then you slurp it on down.

07:50.480 --> 07:51.360
Yeah, man.

07:51.920 --> 07:52.880
Like an oyster.

07:55.760 --> 07:59.520
I would get as many Pringles as I wanted for that serving

07:59.520 --> 08:01.760
and put them all in my mouth at the same time

08:01.760 --> 08:05.200
and then bite them all at once and say, oops.

08:05.200 --> 08:06.720
I farted.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.720
All right.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.720
No one would ever suspect.

08:11.600 --> 08:12.880
Why would he lie about that?

08:12.880 --> 08:14.960
It's a perfect crime.

08:14.960 --> 08:19.040
Unless you have a terrible gastric incident.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.360
They are two sounds that sound very different.

08:22.720 --> 08:23.760
They don't know.

08:23.760 --> 08:26.080
Okay, so in your reality, someone's like,

08:26.080 --> 08:27.280
I've heard you fart before.

08:27.280 --> 08:28.000
That's bullshit.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.680
No, what I'm saying is they might hear you fart and say,

08:31.680 --> 08:33.760
I've heard a human fart before.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.760
I've heard a human fart before.

08:35.760 --> 08:36.640
Nice try, bub.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.800
You sound like a wood chipper.

08:38.800 --> 08:39.520
Are you okay?

08:40.240 --> 08:41.360
I am also-

08:41.360 --> 08:43.040
I'm sorry, did your bowl just crunch?

08:44.720 --> 08:46.000
I am also-

08:46.000 --> 08:48.160
Can you stop popping for a minute?

08:49.040 --> 08:50.160
What have you been eating?

08:50.160 --> 08:51.520
Have you been eating those poppers

08:51.520 --> 08:53.280
you throw at the ground and they snap?

08:53.280 --> 08:56.400
I'm also a robot.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.200
I meant to tell you guys.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.440
And those are my sound of my various gears

09:01.440 --> 09:02.720
cranking and whirring away.

09:02.720 --> 09:03.520
Okay.

09:03.520 --> 09:06.800
Can you sit next to the library grandfather clock

09:06.800 --> 09:08.000
and eat a chip a second?

09:09.200 --> 09:10.000
That's very good.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.080
Chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp.

09:12.080 --> 09:13.920
You're going to have to get really good,

09:13.920 --> 09:17.360
like two tubes of Pringles just kind of alternating

09:17.360 --> 09:18.560
back and forth at double hand motion.

09:18.560 --> 09:20.240
And then when you run out, you have to loudly exclaim,

09:20.240 --> 09:21.120
your clock broke.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.160
Stop making noise.

09:24.160 --> 09:26.880
Now this one would take a little investment

09:26.880 --> 09:28.160
and a little pre-planning.

09:28.160 --> 09:28.640
Okay.

09:28.640 --> 09:30.880
But could you get a book bound

09:30.880 --> 09:33.840
and you write on the cover a book about eating chips

09:34.880 --> 09:36.400
and then you eat behind it.

09:36.400 --> 09:37.760
And someone's going to look over and go,

09:37.760 --> 09:39.920
and go, oh, it's just a really good book.

09:39.920 --> 09:40.400
Oh yeah.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.560
This is an audio book.

09:42.560 --> 09:43.360
That's nothing.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.440
It's like one of those greeting cards that makes noises.

09:47.440 --> 09:47.940
Yeah.

09:48.720 --> 09:51.200
This is an immersive book experience.

09:51.200 --> 09:52.720
And then you, and they're like, what happened?

09:52.720 --> 09:54.880
And you say, I just found the chips in here.

09:54.880 --> 09:56.800
Could you just do it in the bathroom?

09:57.440 --> 09:59.200
Could you just stand up and loudly announce,

09:59.200 --> 10:02.080
I have to go to the bathroom for the other reason.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.960
If I walked into a public restroom

10:04.960 --> 10:07.760
and saw a human being just standing there eating chips,

10:07.760 --> 10:08.960
I would call the police.

10:08.960 --> 10:11.600
No, I went to someone who once walked into a bathroom

10:11.600 --> 10:13.200
and saw someone eating corn on the cob.

10:13.200 --> 10:13.440
Yes.

10:14.080 --> 10:17.840
I think chips would be much less confrontational.

10:18.560 --> 10:19.120
Okay.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.480
This is how that scene would play out.

10:20.480 --> 10:22.160
You walk in, you make eye contact and they go,

10:22.160 --> 10:23.440
I want it to be quiet.

10:23.440 --> 10:30.800
Okay. I'm going to go pee in the periodicals.

10:30.800 --> 10:33.520
I would probably get a little sassy about it

10:33.520 --> 10:35.600
and just assume they're lucky I'm at a library.

10:35.600 --> 10:35.840
Yeah.

10:37.680 --> 10:41.040
My mind went to, I would say like, I'll let you go,

10:41.040 --> 10:43.280
but you got to cut me in on this chips deal.

10:43.280 --> 10:46.000
But I don't think a bathroom's where I want stranger chips.

10:46.000 --> 10:54.320
I fucking love that show, man.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.080
We also take questions from the audience

10:56.080 --> 10:57.360
and we try to help those people.

10:58.000 --> 10:58.960
Here's the first one.

10:59.600 --> 11:02.720
I am a father of a five and a half year old girl

11:02.720 --> 11:05.200
who loves Barbies and especially loves

11:05.200 --> 11:06.720
when I play Barbies with her.

11:06.720 --> 11:08.160
Normally she's very creative

11:08.160 --> 11:10.560
making her own DIY Barbie clothes and furniture,

11:10.560 --> 11:11.920
but a problem arises when it comes

11:11.920 --> 11:13.840
to actually play with the dolls.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.520
The scenarios she puts her Barbies in

11:15.520 --> 11:17.200
are devoid of any conflict.

11:19.520 --> 11:20.560
When I play with her,

11:20.560 --> 11:22.640
I try to instill some sort of small crisis

11:22.640 --> 11:23.680
for the dolls to overcome,

11:24.320 --> 11:28.960
like running late to the airport or fighting a monster.

11:28.960 --> 11:31.040
Every time I try to create some sort of story,

11:31.040 --> 11:33.760
my daughter argues that only good things can happen

11:33.760 --> 11:35.200
and pretty much gives me a script

11:35.200 --> 11:36.960
for what my Barbies are allowed to say and do.

11:37.920 --> 11:40.480
How can I teach my daughter to craft compelling stories

11:42.640 --> 11:44.400
so we can keep playing Barbies together?

11:44.400 --> 11:46.800
That's from Mattel Melodrama in Manhattan.

11:46.800 --> 11:47.440
Are you here?

11:48.640 --> 11:49.120
Hello.

11:53.200 --> 11:59.280
You could just chill and have a cake party, JJ Abrams.

11:59.280 --> 12:00.160
Chill the fuck out.

12:02.000 --> 12:02.500
Nope.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.240
Hard disagree.

12:04.240 --> 12:05.920
When we play with our children,

12:05.920 --> 12:07.200
we are not playing to have fun,

12:07.200 --> 12:08.160
we're playing to teach.

12:09.280 --> 12:12.560
In this day and age of content generation,

12:12.560 --> 12:17.120
multi-transmedia, multi-year streaming deals,

12:17.120 --> 12:19.280
the number one skill you can pass on to your children

12:19.280 --> 12:21.600
is fucking narrative crafting.

12:21.600 --> 12:23.840
Yeah, can't wait for Charlie and BB

12:23.840 --> 12:25.520
to get their shows on see-so too.

12:26.320 --> 12:27.680
Hey everybody, thanks for joining me.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.640
It's another episode of my actual play Barbie podcast.

12:31.920 --> 12:34.960
You gotta teach these kids how to do a story.

12:34.960 --> 12:35.440
Yeah.

12:35.440 --> 12:38.160
Because here's my bet, right?

12:38.160 --> 12:41.680
Your daughter likes when nice things happen to Barbie

12:41.680 --> 12:43.520
because your daughter likes Barbie.

12:43.520 --> 12:48.160
And I get that, but can you explain to her

12:48.160 --> 12:49.760
that that's not going to strengthen

12:49.760 --> 12:51.360
Barbie's will of character?

12:52.240 --> 12:53.680
It's not gonna make her tough.

12:53.680 --> 12:55.040
Here's the thing, yes, that's nice,

12:55.680 --> 12:57.120
but what is she learning?

12:57.120 --> 12:58.560
Is five and a half too young

12:58.560 --> 13:00.400
to learn about the hero's journey?

13:00.400 --> 13:01.680
Yes, thank you.

13:01.680 --> 13:02.160
Thank you.

13:02.160 --> 13:05.760
Listen, yes, Barbie thought she was doing okay,

13:05.760 --> 13:09.360
but she had to lose it all to find out how much she had.

13:09.360 --> 13:12.080
A daddy production.

13:17.920 --> 13:18.880
Barbie has to grow.

13:18.880 --> 13:20.000
Barbie has to learn.

13:20.000 --> 13:20.240
Yes.

13:20.960 --> 13:22.000
Yeah, Barbie's great.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.800
But like, what if Barbie had challenges

13:24.800 --> 13:25.760
that she had to overcome?

13:25.760 --> 13:27.600
And do you care more about Barbie

13:27.600 --> 13:29.680
now that she's succeeded or failed?

13:29.680 --> 13:30.320
I don't know.

13:30.320 --> 13:31.120
Right, maybe-

13:31.120 --> 13:33.360
We're still so early, we're storyboarding.

13:33.360 --> 13:35.120
Maybe Ken loses his job.

13:35.120 --> 13:37.360
Barbie has to take on a second job to cover

13:37.360 --> 13:40.240
and then he finds that he really likes being at home.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.520
And Barbie's not cool with that

13:41.520 --> 13:43.040
because that fucking sucks.

13:43.040 --> 13:43.760
That's interesting.

13:43.760 --> 13:46.000
Right, and then they talk through their problems.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.520
Now their marriage is stronger than ever.

13:47.520 --> 13:48.560
Okay, now I'm getting the-

13:48.560 --> 13:50.240
Okay, I'm on the daughter's side now.

13:50.240 --> 13:50.880
I just flipped.

13:50.880 --> 13:52.640
Yes, thank you.

13:52.640 --> 13:53.360
Welcome.

13:53.360 --> 13:53.920
Welcome to the team.

13:53.920 --> 13:54.960
You don't want to see Ken and Barbie

13:54.960 --> 13:56.400
deal with their marital issues?

13:56.400 --> 13:57.920
See, I had a fix for this,

13:57.920 --> 13:59.600
that I was like, this is a good idea.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.360
I'm going to say this out loud.

14:01.360 --> 14:03.440
And then I was like, no, it's not a good fix.

14:03.440 --> 14:04.560
My fix for it was,

14:04.560 --> 14:07.040
just imagine the drama in your own mind,

14:07.040 --> 14:07.760
which is to say,

14:08.240 --> 14:11.440
Barbie is going to leave Ken one of these days

14:11.440 --> 14:13.040
and doesn't know how to do it.

14:13.600 --> 14:17.440
And just keep that in your play with Ken.

14:17.440 --> 14:18.960
But at that point,

14:18.960 --> 14:21.600
your play is going to be different

14:21.600 --> 14:23.360
and the daughter's going to know why.

14:23.360 --> 14:26.400
Yes, I do that with Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood.

14:26.400 --> 14:27.440
Right, you're just assuming

14:27.440 --> 14:29.680
they're eating the gazelles off screen.

14:29.680 --> 14:31.760
Well, the thing that I'm always wondering is,

14:31.760 --> 14:33.280
what happened to Prince Monday?

14:33.280 --> 14:35.680
And I think about it all the time.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.040
When I'm watching that show,

14:37.040 --> 14:38.960
I believe that there was a bloody coup

14:38.960 --> 14:42.160
in which Prince Tuesday overthrew Prince Monday.

14:42.160 --> 14:42.720
Right.

14:42.720 --> 14:45.680
And I think about it all the time.

14:45.680 --> 14:46.880
I know the problem.

14:46.880 --> 14:48.720
Barbie and Ken can be happy.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.320
They should be happy.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.480
But who's that that just moved in next door?

14:53.040 --> 14:56.160
Third wheel adding some drama into the story.

14:56.160 --> 14:58.400
It's kind of like Stinky Doug or whatever,

14:58.400 --> 14:58.880
you know?

14:58.880 --> 15:03.520
You need your Dupree of your... you mean Dupree.

15:03.520 --> 15:04.320
You need your Dupree.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.160
Oh, this is Scalator has moved in.

15:06.160 --> 15:07.680
Scalator moved in next door.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.200
The property values are dropping.

15:09.200 --> 15:09.840
Now you're at drama.

15:09.840 --> 15:13.280
Is she too young to learn about the Stinky Doug journey?

15:13.280 --> 15:15.440
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Sophie.

15:15.440 --> 15:16.240
Thank you, Sophie.

15:16.240 --> 15:20.400
It's Yahoo answers user Michael, who asks,

15:20.400 --> 15:22.560
we have soft flesh on the outside

15:22.560 --> 15:30.240
and hard bone on the inside.

15:30.240 --> 15:33.120
OK, you've got Justin's attention.

15:33.120 --> 15:34.800
Now reel him in halfway through.

15:36.720 --> 15:39.920
We have soft flesh on the inside and on the outside

15:39.920 --> 15:41.200
and hard bone on the inside.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.000
Stop selling.

15:42.000 --> 15:42.720
Stop selling.

15:42.720 --> 15:43.440
I love it.

15:43.440 --> 15:48.800
Animals like crabs and insects have soft in the inside,

15:48.800 --> 15:49.920
hard on the outside.

15:49.920 --> 15:55.760
How does that work?

15:55.760 --> 15:56.080
Huh?

15:56.800 --> 15:59.040
How do they even move without bones in there?

15:59.040 --> 15:59.920
Right?

15:59.920 --> 16:02.160
Is it just their jelly squishing around until they...

16:02.160 --> 16:04.160
Jelly pushing up against their armor.

16:05.360 --> 16:08.800
Well, this seems like a poor design choice.

16:08.800 --> 16:09.280
Thank you.

16:09.920 --> 16:10.880
If you could trade...

16:11.520 --> 16:13.440
I hate seeing you hold that microphone.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.080
I do not know.

16:14.720 --> 16:18.880
If you could trade feeling the breath of your newborn baby

16:18.880 --> 16:19.840
on the nape of your neck.

16:19.840 --> 16:22.240
If you could trade that for bitchin' armor

16:22.240 --> 16:24.240
that helps you to sever your enemies.

16:24.240 --> 16:24.480
Yes.

16:25.120 --> 16:26.160
Obviously, right?

16:26.160 --> 16:27.040
Yes, obviously.

16:27.040 --> 16:29.440
I mean, listen, we've all dreamed of a mugger

16:29.440 --> 16:31.440
pulling a knife on you, going to stab you on

16:31.440 --> 16:33.280
and shatters against your carapace.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.280
No knives, no knives.

16:35.280 --> 16:36.640
There's no more violence.

16:37.600 --> 16:38.720
We fixed violence.

16:38.720 --> 16:39.600
There's no point.

16:40.320 --> 16:41.680
Everyone's got armor.

16:42.240 --> 16:43.760
Everyone's got exoplating.

16:43.760 --> 16:45.760
There's no point in doing crimes.

16:45.760 --> 16:48.880
Everybody's got claws for hands and exoplating.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.200
There's no crime anymore.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.160
What would be the point?

16:52.160 --> 16:52.880
I mean, there would still be...

16:52.880 --> 16:55.760
You could still embezzle, even if everybody had a carapace.

16:56.480 --> 17:00.400
Are you gonna embezzle if you know your boss has giant exoclaws?

17:00.400 --> 17:02.000
Yes, because in the world you've posited,

17:02.000 --> 17:03.600
he can't get through my armor.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.680
Some people have better claws than other people.

17:05.680 --> 17:07.440
Okay, so now there is some...

17:07.440 --> 17:08.320
There's still disparity.

17:08.320 --> 17:09.520
There's still some violence.

17:09.520 --> 17:10.960
There's still haves and have-nots,

17:10.960 --> 17:14.240
but we don't fix it through crime.

17:14.240 --> 17:15.280
There's no more crime.

17:15.280 --> 17:15.760
Oh, okay.

17:15.760 --> 17:16.720
There's no violent crime.

17:16.720 --> 17:19.200
There's no white collar crime, Travis.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.840
Milk is a controlled substance in this world

17:21.840 --> 17:25.120
because we don't want the imbalance to get too wild.

17:25.120 --> 17:26.880
I love the skull.

17:26.880 --> 17:27.920
The skull's great.

17:27.920 --> 17:29.360
God, I love the skull.

17:29.360 --> 17:30.320
I'm wild about it.

17:30.320 --> 17:31.120
Cool stuff.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.040
Brain helmet and my skin.

17:33.040 --> 17:33.840
Good stuff.

17:33.840 --> 17:38.400
I love how if they cut through the top of my face,

17:39.760 --> 17:44.240
it'll stop because the skull will stop before the brain.

17:44.240 --> 17:45.600
Skull says not so fast.

17:45.600 --> 17:46.720
But wait, here's...

17:46.720 --> 17:48.160
My friend brain is in here.

17:48.160 --> 17:50.240
Let me flip it on you.

17:50.240 --> 17:52.560
If there's a part they can't cut through,

17:52.560 --> 17:54.560
let's put that on the outside.

17:55.120 --> 17:57.680
Then I don't even got to worry about knives no more.

17:57.680 --> 17:58.560
God, come on.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.520
As long as we're doing a note session for God,

18:01.520 --> 18:03.760
I would also say rib cage.

18:03.760 --> 18:04.720
I love that.

18:04.720 --> 18:06.080
Protecting my thing.

18:06.080 --> 18:09.680
Why'd you put holes in there?

18:09.680 --> 18:11.200
This protects everything.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.360
Why would you have holes?

18:13.360 --> 18:15.440
It stops in my tummy area.

18:15.440 --> 18:19.840
And we're talking about vulnerabilities.

18:19.840 --> 18:21.200
You know my brain's in here.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.200
You know that that soup's important.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.480
And we love the skull.

18:24.480 --> 18:25.280
Love the skull.

18:26.400 --> 18:29.600
But can we talk about the two holes you put in the front

18:29.600 --> 18:32.160
with the bullseyes in front of them made of jelly?

18:33.120 --> 18:34.240
Are you sure?

18:34.240 --> 18:38.320
And this thing here, that if it's hit wrong, I die.

18:38.320 --> 18:39.040
I die?

18:39.600 --> 18:42.240
The thing that's literally in front of me all the time.

18:42.240 --> 18:45.680
You put a hoops destruct button on the front of my face?

18:46.240 --> 18:47.360
Are you sure?

18:47.360 --> 18:50.960
And also, as long as we're at it, weak points here, here,

18:50.960 --> 18:53.280
here, here, here, here, here.

18:53.280 --> 18:54.320
Solid bone.

18:54.320 --> 18:55.120
Thank you.

18:55.120 --> 18:58.400
Also, if sugar bad, why it tastes so good.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.120
Yes.

18:59.120 --> 18:59.840
Thank you.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.360
You got to help me help you.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.200
Why does the sugar make our mouth bones fall out?

19:07.200 --> 19:09.760
Yes, and while we're talking about mouth bones,

19:09.760 --> 19:12.000
why I got to floss one solid piece.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.960
One big, one solid chomper.

19:14.960 --> 19:16.240
I love your son.

19:16.240 --> 19:17.600
All his great stuff.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.040
I'm crazy about it.

19:19.040 --> 19:21.760
But the two holes in the front are so bad.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.200
I'm not wild about that.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.160
Not wild about it.

19:24.160 --> 19:27.280
What if I had plating right here that I had to flip up?

19:27.280 --> 19:30.240
Yes, to say cool stuff or eat hot dogs.

19:33.040 --> 19:33.920
Imagine it.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.280
I've improved your creation.

19:35.280 --> 19:37.280
You're very welcome, but I'm your creation.

19:37.280 --> 19:38.880
So you shouldn't feel bad about it.

19:38.880 --> 19:39.380
Yeah.

19:39.380 --> 19:39.880
Yeah.

19:41.460 --> 19:43.460
All right, that's asked and answered.

19:43.460 --> 19:44.580
We solved it again.

19:49.220 --> 19:51.700
How many of our questions could we solve

19:51.700 --> 19:53.620
just by giving God some notes?

19:54.980 --> 19:58.820
Is it an issue that I shop for underwear online while at work?

19:59.540 --> 20:02.580
I do have big, very visible monitor,

20:02.580 --> 20:04.340
and it's not like I'm-

20:04.340 --> 20:06.340
It's not what I thought that sentence was going to-

20:06.340 --> 20:09.540
I have big, very visible underwear.

20:09.540 --> 20:10.900
That's how I like it.

20:10.900 --> 20:12.260
That's my style.

20:12.260 --> 20:13.300
Prominent.

20:13.300 --> 20:16.580
They hang out the top of my pants and form basically a skirt.

20:16.580 --> 20:17.080
It's rad.

20:18.180 --> 20:20.340
I like my underpants billowy.

20:21.140 --> 20:23.780
I do have very big, visible monitor,

20:23.780 --> 20:26.020
and it's not like I'm in an enclosed office.

20:26.020 --> 20:27.860
Should I just wait to order things in general

20:27.860 --> 20:29.940
when I'm on a personal computer?

20:29.940 --> 20:32.980
That's from still not currently using my personal computer.

20:33.940 --> 20:34.900
I would hope not.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.260
This is a live show.

20:36.980 --> 20:37.620
Are you here?

20:38.980 --> 20:39.780
Oh, no.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.300
That was fucking chilling.

20:42.500 --> 20:43.380
They got caught.

20:45.060 --> 20:45.940
They're in jail.

20:46.980 --> 20:50.660
Well, if you ever run into this exact scenario at your job,

20:50.660 --> 20:51.860
I guess we can keep going.

20:52.980 --> 20:54.740
Hey, maybe don't shop for anything

20:54.740 --> 20:57.540
while you're at work on your big, visible monitor.

20:58.580 --> 20:59.220
Okay.

20:59.220 --> 21:02.100
It's been a long time since any of us have had like-

21:02.100 --> 21:02.820
Office jobs.

21:02.820 --> 21:03.860
Office jobs.

21:03.860 --> 21:06.180
It's not 100% of the time work.

21:06.180 --> 21:06.980
Right?

21:06.980 --> 21:07.780
We all know that.

21:07.780 --> 21:09.220
You've got a lot of time to yourself.

21:09.220 --> 21:10.020
You make-

21:10.020 --> 21:10.740
Right.

21:10.740 --> 21:13.140
If you're there for, say, nine hours,

21:13.140 --> 21:14.980
you're doing three hours of work.

21:14.980 --> 21:15.700
Wow.

21:15.700 --> 21:17.940
Fucking employee of the month.

21:17.940 --> 21:19.940
I would say, though, if somebody's like,

21:19.940 --> 21:23.620
Justin, that's not a work time activity.

21:23.620 --> 21:25.700
I'd say, well, I need the underwear to come to work.

21:27.060 --> 21:29.860
If I don't got these, I can't come in, okay?

21:30.500 --> 21:31.300
You don't want that.

21:31.300 --> 21:31.940
I don't want that.

21:31.940 --> 21:32.980
You need them for work.

21:32.980 --> 21:35.780
You don't want me having stuff wicked away from my business?

21:35.780 --> 21:37.620
I got to wick stuff away if I'm going to sit here

21:37.620 --> 21:38.580
and handle the big account.

21:38.580 --> 21:40.100
I need top-notch wicking.

21:40.100 --> 21:43.540
Are you watching YouTube video reviews of cereal?

21:43.540 --> 21:47.380
I got to eat the cereal to get calories for work energy.

21:47.380 --> 21:48.180
Yes.

21:48.180 --> 21:49.380
It's a business expense.

21:49.380 --> 21:50.020
It's a work thing.

21:51.860 --> 21:55.300
You could do what I did when I worked for Tommy Smurl

21:56.020 --> 22:01.060
and wanted to watch a vid

22:01.060 --> 22:03.940
or listen to some Pandora tunes

22:03.940 --> 22:07.220
where I would just get the browser window real small.

22:07.220 --> 22:07.780
Oops.

22:07.780 --> 22:10.100
Like a secret microscope.

22:10.100 --> 22:10.900
Hello, underwear.

22:11.860 --> 22:13.380
You can't see all of it at once.

22:13.380 --> 22:14.180
You got to just look.

22:16.180 --> 22:17.780
So even if somebody was looking at your computer,

22:17.780 --> 22:19.620
they'd be like, that's a fucked up pop-up ad.

22:20.820 --> 22:22.260
I'm getting underwear.

22:23.380 --> 22:24.100
Thanks, Tommy.

22:25.140 --> 22:26.260
He'll never catch me.

22:26.260 --> 22:28.820
I understand that you have a big, visible monitor

22:28.820 --> 22:30.340
and you work in like an open thing,

22:30.340 --> 22:31.940
but could you do something like this

22:31.940 --> 22:36.100
where you have the monitor and you shop like this?

22:36.100 --> 22:37.300
And then when someone comes in, they're like,

22:37.300 --> 22:38.100
what are you doing?

22:38.100 --> 22:40.500
And you're just like, I hurt myself.

22:40.500 --> 22:42.740
This is how I have to look at my computer from now on.

22:42.740 --> 22:45.620
Can you take your computer monitor into the bathroom?

22:45.620 --> 22:48.100
This one also solves a lot of problems.

22:48.100 --> 22:48.340
Yeah.

22:48.340 --> 22:50.340
That's why I spent most of my jobs in the bathroom.

22:50.900 --> 22:51.620
Not this one.

22:51.620 --> 22:52.580
You'll be happy to hear.

22:52.580 --> 22:55.220
I do most of this one in the office, but...

22:55.220 --> 22:57.380
Oh, I'd like to play out a scenario here.

22:57.380 --> 22:58.260
Okay, sure.

22:58.260 --> 23:00.580
Justin, I would like you to play the boss.

23:00.580 --> 23:01.060
Okay.

23:01.060 --> 23:02.980
What kind of a boss am I?

23:02.980 --> 23:06.660
You like to think you're everybody's friend,

23:06.660 --> 23:09.220
but listen, you're still all about the bottom line.

23:09.220 --> 23:10.740
So a boss then?

23:10.740 --> 23:11.240
Yeah.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.020
And you've just walked up to my desk.

23:14.020 --> 23:14.580
Who am I?

23:15.380 --> 23:16.420
Who am I in the scene?

23:16.420 --> 23:18.340
You're kind of the office prankster.

23:18.340 --> 23:19.140
You're the boss.

23:19.140 --> 23:19.860
You're the boss.

23:19.860 --> 23:20.580
You're the boss.

23:20.580 --> 23:21.300
You're the boss.

23:21.300 --> 23:22.820
You're kind of the office prankster,

23:22.820 --> 23:24.980
but you really haven't done a joke in a while.

23:24.980 --> 23:25.220
Okay.

23:25.220 --> 23:26.820
Because you're going through something at home.

23:26.820 --> 23:27.940
Right, sure, sure, sure.

23:27.940 --> 23:30.020
And everyone still thinks of you as the office prankster,

23:30.020 --> 23:32.020
and here, in a couple days, we'll put together...

23:32.020 --> 23:32.820
Okay.

23:32.820 --> 23:33.860
So you've just walked up,

23:33.860 --> 23:36.500
and I'm shopping for underwear on my computer.

23:37.060 --> 23:38.340
Travis.

23:38.340 --> 23:39.380
Oh, no, my name's Derek.

23:42.260 --> 23:43.700
Sorry, that was on me.

23:43.700 --> 23:44.340
Okay.

23:44.340 --> 23:44.820
Continue.

23:46.660 --> 23:49.300
Derek, you're...

23:49.300 --> 23:50.900
Give me all the money in the office.

23:50.900 --> 23:51.700
I've got a katana.

23:54.100 --> 23:54.900
Okay, hold on.

23:55.700 --> 23:56.500
One note.

23:57.860 --> 24:00.100
Was that meant to be a prank, or are you playing that?

24:01.940 --> 24:02.980
Well, it depends.

24:02.980 --> 24:05.380
How rough is this stuff I'm going through at home?

24:08.020 --> 24:09.380
Not quite there.

24:09.380 --> 24:10.180
Okay, it's a prank.

24:10.180 --> 24:10.980
It's a prank, yeah.

24:11.860 --> 24:13.060
Oh, other Derek.

24:13.060 --> 24:14.100
Did I scare you?

24:14.100 --> 24:19.380
You did.

24:19.380 --> 24:21.620
You've been practicing with your katana.

24:21.620 --> 24:23.060
Two years, just for this prank.

24:25.060 --> 24:27.940
I know that it's not good for me to lead with criticism,

24:27.940 --> 24:29.460
so I'm going to try to ease into it.

24:29.460 --> 24:29.700
Okay.

24:30.580 --> 24:32.180
So, Derek, have you seen this...

24:33.540 --> 24:36.020
This new movie, The Joker, everybody's talking about.

24:37.060 --> 24:38.420
Have you seen this, The Joker?

24:38.420 --> 24:39.860
The one with Jared Leto?

24:39.860 --> 24:41.860
I don't get out to see the movies very much.

24:41.860 --> 24:43.940
Shh, they make Peg nauseous.

24:44.820 --> 24:46.740
Anyway, my wife, Peg, that I have.

24:46.740 --> 24:46.900
Yeah.

24:48.020 --> 24:49.460
Oh, you have a wife, Peg?

24:50.020 --> 24:52.420
My wife, Peg, you've met her at the party.

24:52.420 --> 24:53.220
Yes.

24:53.220 --> 24:58.020
Anyway, this computer screen you got going around,

24:58.020 --> 25:01.140
I love how most of it's work, but some of it's underwear.

25:01.700 --> 25:01.940
Yeah.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.860
Well, I guess the cat's out of the bag.

25:06.500 --> 25:08.020
I was shopping for a present for you.

25:08.020 --> 25:09.940
Aww.

25:09.940 --> 25:10.660
Oh, boy.

25:12.100 --> 25:17.140
That's really nice, but if Peg finds underwear

25:17.140 --> 25:19.460
that she doesn't buy me in my drawers,

25:19.460 --> 25:22.100
I think we're going to have a little bit of a problem at home.

25:25.860 --> 25:26.900
Holy shit!

25:26.900 --> 25:27.940
Oh, no, he's dying!

25:28.580 --> 25:30.020
Under, Derek, get over here!

25:30.020 --> 25:32.420
You see me behind him with two knives in his back.

25:32.420 --> 25:33.380
Haha, yes!

25:33.380 --> 25:35.300
No, you took the prank too far!

25:35.300 --> 25:35.940
Gotcha!

25:35.940 --> 25:37.780
That's not a prank, you've killed him!

25:37.780 --> 25:39.780
Blood gush, blood gush, blood gush.

25:40.420 --> 25:43.140
If only we had our hard stuff on the outside!

25:44.420 --> 25:45.860
None of this would have happened.

25:46.980 --> 25:47.700
No, no.

25:47.700 --> 25:49.460
Unseen, I guess.

25:51.940 --> 25:54.580
Here's another Yahoo that was sent in by Debra.

25:57.140 --> 25:58.980
That's a listener of our show!

25:58.980 --> 25:59.700
Yeah, that's fair.

26:01.860 --> 26:05.860
Thank you, Debra, she said in a normal voice.

26:05.860 --> 26:08.500
Rae, if you're listening, your voice is normal, it's fine.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.260
We all have different instruments.

26:13.220 --> 26:13.780
Ma.

26:15.540 --> 26:18.900
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user, Ted, who asks,

26:20.420 --> 26:22.260
Matthew McConaughey fanfiction?

26:27.940 --> 26:29.940
Does anyone know where I can find fanfiction

26:29.940 --> 26:31.140
about Matthew McConaughey?

26:32.100 --> 26:32.900
The internet?

26:32.900 --> 26:33.860
The internet?

26:35.780 --> 26:37.540
It doesn't need to be anything crazy,

26:37.540 --> 26:40.820
just like going about his life and maybe a mystery happens.

26:44.500 --> 26:50.420
Okay, listen, I was prepared to perhaps mock this person.

26:50.420 --> 26:50.740
Right.

26:50.740 --> 26:55.140
As we so often do, but if there was a TV show.

26:55.140 --> 26:55.460
Right.

26:55.460 --> 26:57.940
In which Matthew McConaughey played himself,

26:57.940 --> 27:00.020
just trying to go about his life, making movies,

27:00.020 --> 27:01.540
Fools Gold 2 or whatever.

27:01.540 --> 27:02.260
Right.

27:02.260 --> 27:04.900
And also mysteries just kept popping up

27:04.900 --> 27:07.140
and no one else is going to take care of him except him.

27:07.140 --> 27:07.540
Right.

27:07.540 --> 27:08.900
I would watch the fuck out of that!

27:11.540 --> 27:13.540
That was True Detective, basically.

27:15.620 --> 27:16.020
Dang!

27:18.260 --> 27:19.940
Okay, so here's how we're going to do it.

27:19.940 --> 27:20.180
Okay.

27:21.540 --> 27:22.900
We're going to do one word at a time.

27:22.900 --> 27:23.700
Jesus Christ.

27:24.340 --> 27:26.180
And then it'll be the rest of the show.

27:26.180 --> 27:28.020
Now we're just going to build and see if we can come up

27:28.020 --> 27:29.940
with anything good and if it's bad,

27:29.940 --> 27:33.540
if the story starts to go wrong, we'll jettison it and start again.

27:33.540 --> 27:34.340
I'll start.

27:34.340 --> 27:35.300
Matthew.

27:35.300 --> 27:36.260
Broderick.

27:36.260 --> 27:36.500
Fuck.

27:40.180 --> 27:40.820
That close.

27:43.860 --> 27:44.180
Fuck.

27:44.180 --> 27:45.380
He could still be there.

27:45.380 --> 27:46.580
He could still be there.

27:46.580 --> 27:48.500
There was no prompt in there that said,

27:48.500 --> 27:50.260
and please don't include Matthew Broderick.

27:50.900 --> 27:53.140
McConaughey, Broderick's his middle name.

27:53.140 --> 27:53.700
Nice.

27:53.700 --> 27:54.420
Okay.

27:54.420 --> 27:55.140
Was.

27:55.140 --> 27:56.100
Pulled it from the fire.

27:56.100 --> 27:56.580
Drinking.

27:57.220 --> 27:57.460
A.

27:58.500 --> 27:59.380
Whiskey.

27:59.380 --> 27:59.880
Ooh.

28:01.060 --> 28:01.560
An.

28:06.740 --> 28:07.460
It's you.

28:07.460 --> 28:07.960
Milk.

28:10.420 --> 28:10.920
With.

28:13.860 --> 28:14.360
A.

28:17.700 --> 28:18.200
Tall.

28:19.460 --> 28:20.020
Matthew.

28:24.100 --> 28:24.660
Statue.

28:26.180 --> 28:27.140
It's a statue of Matthew McConaughey.

28:27.140 --> 28:28.980
So far, this story rules.

28:28.980 --> 28:29.540
So good.

28:29.540 --> 28:30.260
I don't think this is working.

28:30.260 --> 28:31.860
Let's get the mystery in there.

28:31.860 --> 28:32.260
Okay.

28:32.260 --> 28:33.460
Let's start again.

28:33.460 --> 28:34.420
No, we'll keep going.

28:34.420 --> 28:35.060
Faster though.

28:35.060 --> 28:35.460
Okay.

28:35.460 --> 28:35.940
Right, right.

28:35.940 --> 28:36.900
We're overthinking it.

28:36.900 --> 28:37.620
Yes, you're right.

28:37.620 --> 28:37.780
Okay.

28:38.500 --> 28:39.220
Gunshots.

28:40.180 --> 28:41.300
Rang out.

28:41.300 --> 28:41.940
In.

28:41.940 --> 28:42.580
The.

28:42.580 --> 28:43.080
Car.

28:47.780 --> 28:48.820
Okay, I messed up.

28:51.060 --> 28:52.660
This is the shortest mystery.

28:53.860 --> 28:54.740
No, play it out.

28:54.740 --> 28:55.240
And.

28:56.980 --> 28:57.480
He.

28:57.480 --> 28:58.920
He instilled.

28:59.880 --> 29:00.680
Hope.

29:00.680 --> 29:01.180
In.

29:01.960 --> 29:03.000
Generation.

29:03.000 --> 29:03.500
Of.

29:03.960 --> 29:04.760
Musicians.

29:08.040 --> 29:08.680
Anyways.

29:12.920 --> 29:13.960
The end.

29:17.640 --> 29:18.760
We've done it again.

29:20.360 --> 29:20.920
Not bad.

29:21.880 --> 29:25.480
We didn't even get to the dog or love interest I had planned.

29:25.480 --> 29:29.080
Do you think mysteries just naturally happened during Matthew McConaughey's day?

29:29.080 --> 29:32.120
In which case, this would not be fan fiction, but non-fiction.

29:32.120 --> 29:33.640
This would just be his diary.

29:33.640 --> 29:34.120
Yes.

29:34.120 --> 29:35.080
The memoir.

29:35.080 --> 29:40.280
I think any mystery that happens in Matthew McConaughey's life ends with,

29:40.280 --> 29:42.520
it was Woody Harrelson that stole my weed.

29:44.680 --> 29:45.320
Oh, that's right.

29:45.320 --> 29:48.040
I left my bongos at Woody Harrelson's house.

29:48.040 --> 29:49.800
Something along those lines.

29:49.800 --> 29:50.280
That's right.

29:50.280 --> 29:52.040
I asked Woody Harrelson to wash my dog.

29:52.040 --> 29:52.540
Right.

29:52.540 --> 29:54.940
Anyway, should we do another question?

29:54.940 --> 29:58.940
My office holds mandatory annual safety meetings, but I skipped this year's meeting

29:58.940 --> 30:01.020
to go to the DC MBMBAM show in September.

30:03.020 --> 30:04.380
HR told me no problem.

30:05.340 --> 30:06.620
Just come to the makeup meeting.

30:07.100 --> 30:09.260
But then they scheduled the makeup meeting for today.

30:12.060 --> 30:14.300
And I missed it to see MBMBAM live again.

30:16.140 --> 30:18.620
In my defense, I bought the tickets way before they scheduled the meetings.

30:18.620 --> 30:19.420
It's less cool.

30:19.420 --> 30:20.300
You should have just left it.

30:20.300 --> 30:22.940
Anyway, I like to do better when you're a rebel.

30:24.140 --> 30:30.140
Can you give me the lowdown on office safety so that I can accomplish both things today?

30:31.340 --> 30:34.140
That's from Super Save and Silver Spring.

30:34.140 --> 30:34.940
Are you here?

30:35.980 --> 30:36.940
Oh, real close.

30:36.940 --> 30:37.440
Hello.

30:39.420 --> 30:41.100
In the splash zone.

30:41.100 --> 30:43.660
Hey, Paulie, can I trouble you for a little bit more wine whenever you get a second?

30:43.660 --> 30:44.700
Little vino.

30:44.700 --> 30:45.260
Thank you, Paul.

30:45.260 --> 30:46.220
Little vino, Paul.

30:46.220 --> 30:46.860
Thank you, by the way.

30:46.860 --> 30:49.100
So, I'm going to ask you a question.

30:49.100 --> 30:50.380
Thank you, bud.

30:50.380 --> 30:55.820
So, first and foremost, you've got to find a comfortable level, angle, height for your chair.

30:55.820 --> 30:57.180
You're going to sit in it every day.

30:57.820 --> 31:00.220
And you're going to think, I'm a little uncomfortable now, but it's fine.

31:00.220 --> 31:01.260
I just got to get to work.

31:01.260 --> 31:03.820
And then you're going to be at that job for 46 years.

31:03.820 --> 31:04.320
Yes.

31:04.780 --> 31:06.380
And it's going to break your insides.

31:06.380 --> 31:06.860
Yeah.

31:06.860 --> 31:08.620
Get a comfortable chair.

31:08.620 --> 31:09.100
Yeah.

31:09.100 --> 31:11.260
Spine will be all twisted up like hollow bread.

31:11.260 --> 31:12.540
It'll be a nightmare.

31:12.540 --> 31:16.700
Next, the printer is super heavy.

31:17.500 --> 31:18.460
Thank you.

31:18.460 --> 31:19.260
Yeah.

31:19.260 --> 31:20.380
So, be careful about that.

31:22.540 --> 31:24.140
That's going to sound like a challenge.

31:24.140 --> 31:26.060
And you're going to think, oh, yeah?

31:26.620 --> 31:27.500
It's not a challenge.

31:27.500 --> 31:28.940
It's a warning and a threat.

31:28.940 --> 31:30.140
Don't try to pick up the printer.

31:30.140 --> 31:31.100
It's really fucking heavy.

31:31.100 --> 31:35.260
This isn't us saying the printer's heavy for most people, but some people.

31:35.260 --> 31:37.100
This is like even Chad can't pick it up.

31:37.100 --> 31:37.900
And he's ripped.

31:37.900 --> 31:38.780
He's really strong.

31:38.780 --> 31:39.900
He works out all the time.

31:39.900 --> 31:41.340
And I saw him try to lift it.

31:41.340 --> 31:43.260
And he went, oh, that's heavy.

31:43.260 --> 31:44.140
That's how heavy the printer is.

31:44.140 --> 31:48.860
You're telling me Chad, who was on the cover of the October issue of Big Guys Monthly, can't

31:48.860 --> 31:50.220
lift it, but you think you can?

31:50.220 --> 31:51.660
The printer's so fucking heavy.

31:52.460 --> 31:53.020
Don't.

31:53.020 --> 31:53.500
Be smart about this.

31:53.500 --> 31:56.300
Also, don't do stair tricks.

31:56.300 --> 31:57.900
I know it's exciting.

31:57.900 --> 31:59.660
You want to do tricks on the stairs.

31:59.660 --> 32:03.500
You want to impress the young guy who just got a job in the mail room and has a sick

32:03.500 --> 32:06.860
scooter and he can do stair tricks, but he's a young guy.

32:06.860 --> 32:09.020
And stair tricks are a young man's game.

32:09.020 --> 32:10.380
Don't impress him that way.

32:10.380 --> 32:12.620
Impress him by like buying him beer or something.

32:12.620 --> 32:13.980
He'll appreciate that.

32:13.980 --> 32:18.540
Don't do stair tricks, especially not if you're carrying the super heavy printer.

32:18.540 --> 32:19.900
Don't touch the fucking printer.

32:19.900 --> 32:22.700
No, but I'm saying if you did, but if you did touch the printer.

32:22.700 --> 32:24.780
No sunglasses at work.

32:25.340 --> 32:26.460
You're indoors.

32:26.460 --> 32:27.420
It's too dark.

32:27.420 --> 32:29.020
You're going to fall down the stairs.

32:30.700 --> 32:34.700
Don't turn off all the lights so it's a quote, even playing field.

32:35.420 --> 32:38.060
No one will be able to see your sunglasses.

32:38.060 --> 32:39.180
It's pointless.

32:40.060 --> 32:43.580
Also, and they probably would be too scared to even cover this in a meeting.

32:43.580 --> 32:45.500
But we're going to talk about emotional safety.

32:46.540 --> 32:49.420
Don't Janice is going to compliment you.

32:50.060 --> 32:50.780
Right?

32:50.780 --> 32:51.660
She is.

32:51.660 --> 32:52.620
She wants something.

32:53.820 --> 32:55.180
Yeah, she is using it.

32:55.180 --> 32:57.980
Don't trust Janice.

32:57.980 --> 33:01.580
Not everybody can use the forklift.

33:01.580 --> 33:01.980
Yes.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.980
They make it look easy.

33:03.980 --> 33:04.620
It's not.

33:05.420 --> 33:05.820
It's cool.

33:05.820 --> 33:06.780
I played Shenmue.

33:06.780 --> 33:07.820
It doesn't matter.

33:07.820 --> 33:09.260
It doesn't work that way.

33:09.260 --> 33:12.460
You will find nary an X button on the entire thing.

33:12.460 --> 33:19.020
Now, if you could, I'm not saying don't do it, but if you could use the forklift to eat with

33:19.020 --> 33:22.860
and film it and put it on YouTube and have it be like a whole viral thing of like,

33:22.860 --> 33:24.940
I ate with a forklift.

33:24.940 --> 33:26.860
Like that is pretty good.

33:26.860 --> 33:28.700
And that might impress the guy in the mail room.

33:28.700 --> 33:28.940
Yeah.

33:28.940 --> 33:30.460
And I know what you're thinking.

33:30.460 --> 33:32.780
Forklift, copier, loophole.

33:32.780 --> 33:34.700
I'm lifting it with a copier, the forklift.

33:34.700 --> 33:35.900
It's not going to work.

33:35.900 --> 33:36.780
It's not going to work.

33:36.780 --> 33:37.660
It's too heavy.

33:37.660 --> 33:41.500
It is a printer and scanner and fax machine.

33:41.500 --> 33:42.300
All in one.

33:42.300 --> 33:43.500
That's heavy.

33:43.500 --> 33:48.140
Don't go in the elephant pen because you think you can beat them in a fight.

33:48.140 --> 33:49.340
This is if you work at a zoo.

33:49.340 --> 33:51.180
Yeah, I'm specific to that.

33:51.180 --> 33:54.060
If you work at a zoo, I could do a lot just off the top of my head.

33:55.020 --> 33:56.060
Lift your knees.

33:59.740 --> 34:01.020
Lift with your knees.

34:01.020 --> 34:02.460
No, I like the first one better.

34:03.260 --> 34:05.340
Hey, come on, Mr. High Stepper.

34:05.340 --> 34:05.980
Get him up there.

34:05.980 --> 34:08.940
And I'll help you to not trip on Lego buildings.

34:08.940 --> 34:09.900
It's true.

34:09.900 --> 34:13.420
That's true if you lift your knees, they're way up off the floor.

34:15.580 --> 34:16.700
Something I was thinking about.

34:22.780 --> 34:23.340
Breaking.

34:24.140 --> 34:25.020
This just came in.

34:25.660 --> 34:26.700
This is breaking news.

34:29.420 --> 34:30.300
This is a breaking.

34:30.300 --> 34:30.780
Shit.

34:31.340 --> 34:32.060
Whoa, yeah.

34:32.060 --> 34:33.580
This is a breaking on a doll watch.

34:33.580 --> 34:34.140
Just came in.

34:35.820 --> 34:37.100
I got a notification.

34:37.100 --> 34:39.260
I love what happens when I'm at a show already.

34:39.260 --> 34:40.460
It's really convenient.

34:40.460 --> 34:43.580
Yeah, it's weird when it just happens, like, at home or while you're sleeping or something.

34:45.180 --> 34:45.740
Yeah, true.

34:47.500 --> 34:50.220
Hey, if it just came in, why are you having to search through your phone?

34:50.220 --> 34:50.940
Does it not serve?

34:50.940 --> 34:52.780
I want to bring up a photo.

34:52.780 --> 34:55.020
We'll cut this part out, but just so y'all can...

34:55.020 --> 34:57.180
Holy fucking shit.

34:57.740 --> 34:58.860
So what's up?

34:58.860 --> 34:59.660
This is a...

35:00.940 --> 35:01.500
Monster.

35:02.140 --> 35:04.540
Protection troll doll.

35:04.540 --> 35:06.540
Mystical forest idol.

35:06.540 --> 35:07.260
Rare.

35:07.260 --> 35:08.060
Haunted.

35:08.060 --> 35:10.140
That's right, a troll haunted doll.

35:10.140 --> 35:11.900
All of our interests are colliding.

35:13.420 --> 35:17.340
Do I need to buy another protection doll to protect me from this doll?

35:19.660 --> 35:20.140
Yes.

35:20.140 --> 35:21.020
Okay, cool.

35:21.020 --> 35:22.460
It's the perfect scam.

35:22.460 --> 35:24.620
This is from Curious Imports.

35:27.980 --> 35:29.820
This is written in the style...

35:29.820 --> 35:30.540
I mean...

35:30.540 --> 35:32.220
It looks like an E.E. Cummings poem.

35:32.220 --> 35:34.300
Yeah, it's structured in a very fun way.

35:34.300 --> 35:36.700
All right.

35:36.700 --> 35:37.580
Protection troll.

35:39.900 --> 35:41.020
By Langston Hughes.

35:44.940 --> 35:47.420
New resin.

35:48.940 --> 35:50.940
Stands for inches high.

35:52.060 --> 35:54.460
Measurement does not include the hair.

35:56.460 --> 35:57.420
Good?

35:57.420 --> 35:58.540
No need to brag.

36:01.100 --> 36:01.900
Oh, don't worry.

36:01.900 --> 36:05.260
Hey, I'm not counting the hair.

36:06.060 --> 36:08.860
This is your personal protection troll.

36:08.860 --> 36:10.380
Then why do they have it?

36:10.380 --> 36:13.020
He will protect you and keep you safe.

36:13.580 --> 36:18.220
While keeping you safe, he will make sure that no one can harm you.

36:18.220 --> 36:19.420
An important component.

36:20.860 --> 36:23.500
You'll agree to keeping you safe.

36:24.220 --> 36:25.260
Give me all your money.

36:26.300 --> 36:27.980
Good luck, Robert.

36:27.980 --> 36:29.500
I have this toy.

36:29.500 --> 36:32.940
No one can make sure that no one can harm you

36:32.940 --> 36:36.540
or come in your life to bring harm.

36:36.540 --> 36:38.300
We all know some people like that.

36:38.300 --> 36:38.860
Janice.

36:40.700 --> 36:43.820
Protects against thieves and criminals.

36:46.140 --> 36:47.660
Cancel your ADT.

36:48.380 --> 36:49.820
You've got this troll.

36:51.580 --> 36:55.420
Keeps your personal possessions safe and you from harm.

36:56.220 --> 36:58.140
We've established that at this point.

36:58.140 --> 37:01.020
I think that this is my bodyguard and it's a troll.

37:01.980 --> 37:06.380
It is said that when you hold him and speak to him, he will listen.

37:07.580 --> 37:08.860
Well, that's nice, isn't it?

37:09.580 --> 37:13.500
I always love a knees, by the way, when I set and start with it is said

37:13.500 --> 37:16.700
as if the person writing it isn't the only one saying it.

37:16.700 --> 37:18.380
I am saying that you can talk to it.

37:18.940 --> 37:19.580
I guess.

37:19.580 --> 37:22.140
And also, what's the other option?

37:22.140 --> 37:24.300
You start talking to the troll and the troll's always goes.

37:25.420 --> 37:26.300
Pulls out his phone.

37:26.300 --> 37:31.100
To keep your troll doll happy, offer him some sunflower seeds.

37:31.820 --> 37:34.780
Okay, I didn't know this was a transactional protection

37:34.780 --> 37:36.620
because now that you sound like you're in the mob.

37:36.620 --> 37:38.300
Yeah, what if I don't give him enough seeds?

37:38.300 --> 37:39.820
Will he let someone harm me?

37:40.460 --> 37:42.220
I'll keep you and your small business safe.

37:42.220 --> 37:42.940
Don't worry about it.

37:42.940 --> 37:45.660
Just slimy some of them sunflower seeds.

37:45.660 --> 37:47.180
Some more seeds.

37:47.180 --> 37:50.060
Oh, your last shipment didn't include the juice.

37:50.060 --> 37:54.780
So offer him some sunflower seeds or a small flower.

37:54.780 --> 37:57.980
Seeds or a small glass of water or wine.

37:59.100 --> 38:02.860
Just sit this next to him and you may notice it gone.

38:03.580 --> 38:05.900
I don't think I will.

38:08.140 --> 38:09.180
Probably not.

38:09.180 --> 38:11.260
Also, I know what will get you better protection

38:11.260 --> 38:13.100
between the water and the wine.

38:13.100 --> 38:16.620
I want this troll drunk and I want him angry.

38:16.620 --> 38:17.820
Now hold on.

38:17.820 --> 38:20.380
I don't know that I want my protector spirit drunk.

38:21.980 --> 38:23.820
No troll, stop the criminal.

38:23.820 --> 38:25.100
What?

38:25.100 --> 38:25.260
Shit.

38:25.260 --> 38:27.740
If you hear movement in the home at night,

38:27.740 --> 38:29.740
that is when trolls become most active.

38:29.740 --> 38:29.980
Okay.

38:29.980 --> 38:32.780
It only means he is making sure everything is safe.

38:32.780 --> 38:32.940
Okay.

38:32.940 --> 38:35.980
Okay, you have now told this person,

38:36.620 --> 38:39.100
one, this troll will keep you safe.

38:39.820 --> 38:42.460
Two, if you hear someone breaking into your home,

38:43.420 --> 38:45.260
it's probably the troll.

38:45.260 --> 38:46.380
That's the sound.

38:46.380 --> 38:47.740
Do not call the police.

38:48.540 --> 38:50.380
That's the sound of safety.

38:50.380 --> 38:51.740
Honey, do you hear something?

38:51.740 --> 38:53.020
Don't worry, darling.

38:53.020 --> 38:54.060
It's the troll.

38:55.100 --> 38:58.620
Go back to sleep and enjoy that diamond necklace you're wearing.

38:58.620 --> 39:00.540
Once you bond to your troll,

39:00.540 --> 39:03.500
his energy will be with you and travel with you.

39:03.500 --> 39:05.420
You do not need to carry him with you.

39:05.420 --> 39:10.140
Okay, so I'm at the double tree Philadelphia.

39:10.140 --> 39:13.100
I hear a glass smash and someone comes in,

39:13.100 --> 39:14.060
starts rooting around.

39:14.060 --> 39:15.580
It's fine, sweetheart.

39:15.580 --> 39:17.020
It's the troll.

39:17.020 --> 39:18.940
That's how you know that it's the troll.

39:18.940 --> 39:22.620
It's the troll. That's how you know that his spirit is still with us.

39:22.620 --> 39:22.860
Yeah.

39:22.860 --> 39:23.340
Oh, and you know,

39:23.340 --> 39:26.220
I probably forgot to leave a bowl of sunflower seeds for him.

39:26.220 --> 39:27.580
He's probably just a hunky boy.

39:29.180 --> 39:31.020
Get this little guy with you while you can.

39:31.900 --> 39:33.420
Very rare and hard to find.

39:34.540 --> 39:37.340
It's a fucking troll doll that you painted black a little bit.

39:37.980 --> 39:39.020
I mean, he's on eBay.

39:39.740 --> 39:40.780
Not that hard.

39:40.780 --> 39:41.020
Yeah.

39:42.700 --> 39:45.500
As all of you that have shopped with us before,

39:45.500 --> 39:46.620
get this while you can.

39:46.620 --> 39:47.740
Our items go fast.

39:47.740 --> 39:48.620
This is what I like.

39:48.620 --> 39:51.500
This is the only time this will be listed on eBay.

39:51.500 --> 39:54.860
When the auction is over, we will not relist this item.

39:55.740 --> 39:56.700
Oh, no.

39:56.700 --> 39:59.020
Wait, isn't that how it always works?

39:59.020 --> 39:59.740
No, no, no.

39:59.740 --> 40:01.660
This person's saying you have one chance to buy it.

40:01.660 --> 40:04.220
If you don't buy him now, he's sticking with me.

40:05.260 --> 40:06.380
I've grown too attached.

40:06.380 --> 40:08.860
Or I have to throw him into a volcano,

40:08.860 --> 40:11.100
which is what the scroll said to do.

40:11.100 --> 40:12.540
By the way, there's a scroll.

40:12.540 --> 40:17.900
It's so important that you read it, but I did lose it.

40:17.900 --> 40:19.100
Where's the part where it's like,

40:19.100 --> 40:21.100
by the way, this is all bullshit.

40:21.100 --> 40:22.220
You're buying garbage.

40:22.220 --> 40:23.500
eBay makes me say this.

40:23.500 --> 40:26.780
As required, all metaphysical items are sold as curios.

40:26.780 --> 40:28.140
No claims are made.

40:28.140 --> 40:33.020
All information based on historic lore and who do slash mystic beliefs.

40:33.580 --> 40:37.260
Anything that may or may not happen is up to the one who uses the item.

40:37.260 --> 40:39.020
Sold for entertainment purposes only.

40:39.020 --> 40:43.100
This is directly followed by all metaphysical,

40:43.100 --> 40:46.220
supernatural and haunted items do not have on off switches.

40:46.220 --> 40:50.140
Some items take some time to work and some work right away.

40:50.140 --> 40:57.260
And then there are some that may not work at all for a person's needs.

40:58.380 --> 41:00.860
You must consider this with purchasing items.

41:00.860 --> 41:07.340
If you do not know how to use or active contact us and we can assist you,

41:07.340 --> 41:09.420
please, for the love that is always holy,

41:09.420 --> 41:13.020
please figure out a way to redirect those calls to my personal cellular phone.

41:14.860 --> 41:16.860
I would do anything to be like, hello?

41:18.140 --> 41:20.220
Yeah, the trolly.

41:21.580 --> 41:26.220
Listen, I was robbed terribly last night and your troll didn't do anything.

41:26.220 --> 41:27.580
Well, let me see.

41:28.700 --> 41:30.060
Let's do some troubleshooting.

41:30.060 --> 41:31.260
Let's do some troubleshooting.

41:31.260 --> 41:33.500
Did you leave out sunflower seeds and wine?

41:34.140 --> 41:34.780
Yeah.

41:34.780 --> 41:36.140
I don't know what to do for you then.

41:36.140 --> 41:38.060
I don't know. Not all of them work for some people.

41:38.060 --> 41:40.220
Did you flip on the on switch?

41:40.220 --> 41:41.100
That was a test.

41:41.100 --> 41:41.980
There is a test.

41:41.980 --> 41:42.620
There isn't one.

41:42.620 --> 41:45.260
Anyway, that's your haunted doll watch for this week.

41:58.220 --> 41:59.580
Hey, everybody, it's Griffin.

41:59.580 --> 42:02.860
Thank you so much for listening to this live episode of My Bim Bam.

42:03.580 --> 42:05.500
Like we have said the past couple weeks,

42:05.500 --> 42:08.060
we are sort of filling in time.

42:08.060 --> 42:10.380
Travis and Teresa just had a baby.

42:10.380 --> 42:13.020
And so we're giving him a little bit of a break.

42:13.020 --> 42:16.700
And we will be back with new non-live, I guess,

42:16.700 --> 42:19.740
dead episodes of My Bim Bam next Monday.

42:19.740 --> 42:22.380
So stick with us till then.

42:22.380 --> 42:25.020
This is the second of our Brooklyn shows.

42:25.020 --> 42:25.980
Actually, it was our first.

42:25.980 --> 42:27.500
The first one we put up was our second one.

42:27.500 --> 42:28.300
It's confusing.

42:29.180 --> 42:30.860
But I hope you're enjoying it.

42:30.860 --> 42:33.260
And got a couple of sponsors to tell you about real quick.

42:33.260 --> 42:35.100
The first one is Audible.

42:35.100 --> 42:39.100
Audible has the books that you listen to, that you hear.

42:39.660 --> 42:42.460
A lot of people eat books with their eyes.

42:42.460 --> 42:44.860
Audible says, what about ears, though?

42:44.860 --> 42:50.860
And no matter what your resolution or goal is this year, 2020, 2020 funny,

42:50.860 --> 42:52.700
why don't you fill your life with laughter and love

42:52.700 --> 42:56.860
with an audio book at Audible to inspire and motivate you?

42:58.460 --> 42:59.420
It's real slick.

42:59.420 --> 43:01.660
And hey, we can help you with that

43:01.660 --> 43:03.980
because we have a challenge for current and new members.

43:03.980 --> 43:06.460
If you finish three audio books by March 3,

43:07.020 --> 43:09.420
you'll get a $20 Amazon credit.

43:09.420 --> 43:10.220
That's it.

43:10.220 --> 43:12.220
Audible will keep track of your progress for you.

43:12.220 --> 43:14.220
Just go listen to some good books,

43:14.220 --> 43:17.340
fill your mind and get stronger and better,

43:17.340 --> 43:19.180
and you're gonna get a $20 Amazon credit.

43:19.180 --> 43:19.980
That's a great deal.

43:20.700 --> 43:22.380
If you're looking for someone to listen to,

43:22.380 --> 43:25.260
what about Medallion Status from John Hodgman?

43:25.260 --> 43:27.260
I'm digging into that one now.

43:27.260 --> 43:35.260
And it's a lot of fun and it's very enriching to me spiritually.

43:36.060 --> 43:37.980
You can choose three titles every month,

43:37.980 --> 43:40.460
one audio book and two exclusive Audible originals

43:40.460 --> 43:42.380
that you can't hear anywhere else.

43:42.380 --> 43:44.620
You can listen on any device, anytime, anywhere,

43:44.620 --> 43:47.420
and keep your library forever, even if you cancel.

43:47.420 --> 43:50.060
So start listening with a 30-day Audible trial.

43:50.060 --> 43:53.260
Choose one audio book and two Audible originals absolutely free.

43:53.260 --> 43:58.220
Visit audible.com slash brother or text brother to 500-500.

43:58.940 --> 44:03.500
That's A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com slash brother for a 30-day trial.

44:03.500 --> 44:04.780
Also, I wanna tell you about Squarespace.

44:04.780 --> 44:07.900
Squarespace, they build the websites.

44:07.900 --> 44:09.820
Technically, I guess you build the websites,

44:09.820 --> 44:13.740
they build the thing you use to build the beautiful websites

44:13.740 --> 44:15.180
that you can use to showcase your work,

44:15.180 --> 44:17.100
sell products and services of all kinds,

44:17.100 --> 44:19.980
or promote your physical or online business,

44:19.980 --> 44:21.180
or whatever the hell, man.

44:21.180 --> 44:22.860
I don't think Squarespace is gonna kick in your door

44:22.860 --> 44:23.820
and be like, wrong.

44:24.620 --> 44:26.380
They got beautiful customizable templates

44:26.380 --> 44:27.900
created by world-class designers.

44:27.900 --> 44:30.620
Everything's optimized for mobile right out of the box.

44:30.620 --> 44:32.300
They have free and secure hosting.

44:32.300 --> 44:34.620
There's nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

44:35.660 --> 44:38.700
It's a good platform, folks.

44:38.700 --> 44:39.660
I don't know what else to say.

44:39.660 --> 44:42.940
We have a couple websites we've made with Squarespace,

44:42.940 --> 44:45.900
and it's really easy, and it all looks really good.

44:45.900 --> 44:49.500
So go to squarespace.com slash my brother for a free trial,

44:49.500 --> 44:52.060
and when you're ready to launch, use the offer code mybrother,

44:52.060 --> 44:54.540
and you're gonna save 10% off your first purchase

44:54.540 --> 44:55.900
of a website or domain.

44:57.100 --> 44:58.300
Just freaking do it.

44:58.300 --> 44:59.740
Thanks again for listening.

44:59.740 --> 45:01.420
Thanks to the King's Theatre for having us

45:01.420 --> 45:03.340
in this show in Brooklyn.

45:03.340 --> 45:04.940
It's an absolutely gorgeous venue,

45:04.940 --> 45:06.620
and we are so fortunate to get to play there.

45:07.500 --> 45:11.180
We are figuring out sort of spring touring schedule,

45:11.180 --> 45:13.180
and we'll have more to announce there soon.

45:13.180 --> 45:14.860
I think there may still be some tickets available

45:14.860 --> 45:18.700
for our upcoming shows in Cincinnati here in February.

45:19.260 --> 45:21.660
You can find tickets to that at mcroy.family,

45:21.660 --> 45:25.980
along with all the other merch and new video stuff,

45:25.980 --> 45:29.340
Monster Factory stuff, besties stuff,

45:29.340 --> 45:32.540
all kinds of new, exciting announcements,

45:32.540 --> 45:33.900
all at mcroy.family.

45:34.780 --> 45:37.660
And yeah, I think that's probably about it.

45:37.660 --> 45:39.340
So here's the rest of the episode.

45:39.340 --> 45:41.340
We'll be back again next Monday with a new episode

45:41.340 --> 45:42.860
of Movin' Bam, so talk to you then.

45:42.860 --> 45:43.360
Bye.

45:45.660 --> 45:47.260
Nearly two decades ago,

45:47.900 --> 45:51.340
Commander Data sacrificed his life.

45:51.340 --> 45:54.780
The Greatest Discovery is also about Star Trek Picard.

45:54.780 --> 45:57.180
Jesse Thorne won't let us stay on the network

45:57.180 --> 45:59.420
unless we do all the Star Trek series,

45:59.420 --> 46:01.500
and so here we are doing a show

46:01.500 --> 46:04.540
about maybe our favorite Star Trek character of all time.

46:04.540 --> 46:08.460
If you're excited to watch the new Star Trek Picard series

46:08.460 --> 46:11.420
and you'd like some veteran Star Trek podcasters

46:11.420 --> 46:14.460
to watch it along with, we're your guys.

46:14.460 --> 46:15.740
Sorry you're stuck with us.

46:16.540 --> 46:17.980
The hell are you doing out here, Picard?

46:18.700 --> 46:19.580
Saving the galaxy?

46:19.580 --> 46:22.220
So subscribe to The Greatest Discovery.

46:22.220 --> 46:24.380
You can find it anywhere you find podcasts.

46:24.380 --> 46:26.220
Or at MaximumFun.org.

46:28.220 --> 46:28.780
Hello.

46:28.780 --> 46:29.340
Hello.

46:29.340 --> 46:29.820
Hey.

46:29.820 --> 46:31.500
Hey, what's your, what's your name?

46:31.500 --> 46:32.220
I'm Charlotte.

46:32.220 --> 46:32.940
Hi, Charlotte.

46:34.540 --> 46:35.580
Okay, thank you.

46:35.580 --> 46:40.060
A couple years ago, my boyfriend's family rescued a pet pig

46:40.060 --> 46:42.940
and I really like her to think that I'm not afraid of her,

46:42.940 --> 46:44.140
even though I am.

46:44.140 --> 46:44.640
Okay.

46:46.060 --> 46:47.900
So she's about 250 pounds.

46:47.900 --> 46:49.020
Holy shit.

46:49.020 --> 46:49.520
What?

46:50.300 --> 46:51.980
You're completely justified.

46:54.300 --> 46:57.340
She's a potbelly pig and she really likes his mom.

46:57.340 --> 46:59.820
She's okay with his family, but we live about an hour

46:59.820 --> 47:02.540
and a half away, so we don't see her very often.

47:03.100 --> 47:05.500
So I haven't really had a chance to like bond with her.

47:05.500 --> 47:05.980
Establish dominance.

47:05.980 --> 47:07.020
She isn't really warm to me.

47:07.020 --> 47:07.520
Right.

47:08.700 --> 47:12.060
I've kind of given up on the dream of like being cuddly with her

47:12.060 --> 47:13.420
and friends with her.

47:13.420 --> 47:13.660
Yeah.

47:13.660 --> 47:16.700
But like to kind of be able to walk past her

47:16.700 --> 47:18.860
without her kind of intimidating me.

47:18.860 --> 47:19.420
Yeah, sure.

47:19.420 --> 47:20.700
You're gonna have to intimidate her.

47:20.700 --> 47:21.500
I'm sorry.

47:21.500 --> 47:22.300
Yeah.

47:22.300 --> 47:24.060
Do you eat bacon as a rule?

47:24.060 --> 47:25.740
I've been a vegetarian for six years.

47:25.740 --> 47:26.460
Damn it!

47:26.460 --> 47:27.340
What's the problem?

47:27.340 --> 47:28.780
That was my whole thing.

47:28.780 --> 47:31.420
What about like vegetable bacon?

47:31.420 --> 47:32.140
Does that exist?

47:32.700 --> 47:33.420
It does.

47:33.420 --> 47:36.940
You want this pig to be intimidated

47:36.940 --> 47:38.540
because she's eating vegetable bacon?

47:38.540 --> 47:39.660
Nothing you said made sense.

47:39.660 --> 47:41.100
Listen, I know I said it out loud.

47:41.100 --> 47:41.600
It's fine.

47:45.420 --> 47:48.620
So just to work on the phrasing of the question,

47:48.620 --> 47:51.820
you want the pig to think that you're not afraid of the pig.

47:51.820 --> 47:52.940
You didn't come to us and say,

47:52.940 --> 47:54.540
how can I stop being afraid of the pig?

47:54.540 --> 47:56.060
Because that's not even an option.

47:57.180 --> 47:58.540
This pig is a monster.

47:58.540 --> 48:00.460
This is a kaiju pig at this point.

48:01.500 --> 48:01.980
Basically.

48:01.980 --> 48:04.300
Have you seen the pig do anything bad or dangerous

48:04.300 --> 48:05.340
to another human being?

48:06.060 --> 48:07.740
Not to me, but occasionally she'll cry.

48:07.740 --> 48:09.100
Well, to me, yes.

48:10.780 --> 48:11.500
Are you okay?

48:11.500 --> 48:12.300
Are you okay, Charlotte?

48:12.300 --> 48:13.420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:13.420 --> 48:16.220
My boyfriend and his family is not afraid of her.

48:16.220 --> 48:18.540
Like if you push past her when you're going past her,

48:18.540 --> 48:20.220
she'll use, she's fine with it.

48:20.220 --> 48:21.740
She just senses my hesitation.

48:25.740 --> 48:27.500
You're putting a lot of thoughts in this pig brain.

48:27.500 --> 48:30.060
Are you sure that the pig senses your hesitation?

48:30.060 --> 48:32.220
Okay, I don't know how to convince the pig

48:32.220 --> 48:33.020
that you're not intimidated,

48:33.020 --> 48:35.980
but I do think I know a way for you to get over this.

48:36.780 --> 48:39.900
You're going to need to get like a two and a half pound pig.

48:40.540 --> 48:42.140
Walk past that confidently.

48:42.140 --> 48:43.260
You've done it.

48:43.260 --> 48:44.140
Good job.

48:44.140 --> 48:46.220
Now, like a five pound pig.

48:46.220 --> 48:46.780
Yes.

48:46.780 --> 48:47.820
Walk past that.

48:47.820 --> 48:49.980
You're going to end up owning a lot of pigs.

48:49.980 --> 48:50.300
Yes.

48:50.940 --> 48:53.340
This is a bit of a commitment.

48:53.340 --> 48:53.580
Yeah.

48:54.380 --> 48:57.260
It's going to be a Mr. Popper of Spenguin situation.

48:57.260 --> 48:58.060
Oh, thanks.

48:58.060 --> 49:01.100
My name is Charlotte, so I think I was always envisioning

49:01.100 --> 49:02.620
having a friend of mine.

49:02.620 --> 49:05.100
There's so many reasons why this pig should love you.

49:05.100 --> 49:07.420
You can just spin a web that says dead meat.

49:08.140 --> 49:08.620
Yeah.

49:08.620 --> 49:09.660
Get in line.

49:09.660 --> 49:12.860
Okay, Charlotte, you have to turn the pig against

49:12.860 --> 49:14.700
your boyfriend and your boyfriend's family.

49:15.340 --> 49:17.340
So next time you go over there,

49:17.340 --> 49:20.700
I want you to stand in front of the pig, face him and say,

49:20.700 --> 49:22.700
no, you won't kill this pig.

49:22.700 --> 49:23.180
That's good.

49:23.180 --> 49:24.460
Not on my watch.

49:24.460 --> 49:25.900
I won't allow it.

49:25.900 --> 49:26.860
It's a good pig.

49:27.500 --> 49:30.060
Charlotte, you could try some stuff that intimidates me.

49:30.060 --> 49:31.980
So maybe bring up sports in conversation.

49:34.700 --> 49:37.980
Bring up sports or different kinds of cars that there are.

49:37.980 --> 49:38.220
Yeah.

49:38.780 --> 49:41.740
And you could bring up those while you're talking to the pig

49:41.740 --> 49:43.980
and the pig will be, if the pig is anything like me,

49:44.940 --> 49:45.980
probably intimidated.

49:45.980 --> 49:48.380
I mean, it'd work on me.

49:48.940 --> 49:49.820
Does it help?

49:49.820 --> 49:51.180
I think it doesn't hurt.

49:51.180 --> 49:51.740
Okay, good.

49:56.620 --> 49:57.340
Let's go over here.

49:57.340 --> 49:57.740
Hello.

49:59.420 --> 49:59.900
Hi.

49:59.900 --> 50:00.140
Hi.

50:00.140 --> 50:01.020
What's your name?

50:01.020 --> 50:01.900
I'm Adrian Cowles.

50:01.900 --> 50:05.900
Hi, Adrian Cowles.

50:05.900 --> 50:07.180
My brother and me legend.

50:08.700 --> 50:09.420
Hi, Adrian.

50:09.420 --> 50:10.140
Extremely wild.

50:10.140 --> 50:11.180
Thank you for your service.

50:12.620 --> 50:13.100
I try.

50:13.100 --> 50:17.420
I know you've read a lot of bad yahoos to bring us some of the good ones.

50:17.420 --> 50:18.780
Thank you for that.

50:18.780 --> 50:19.740
Mostly, yeah.

50:19.740 --> 50:21.500
So I sent in two.

50:21.500 --> 50:21.980
Yeah, which one?

50:21.980 --> 50:23.980
Oh, God, Adrian, that's against the rules.

50:23.980 --> 50:25.020
Go fucking sit down.

50:25.020 --> 50:26.940
No, it's about you.

50:26.940 --> 50:29.420
Of course, the one about you going to the bathroom at work.

50:29.420 --> 50:29.900
Yes.

50:30.860 --> 50:34.380
So I'm a teacher and I'm very, very inefficient.

50:34.380 --> 50:36.540
So thank you.

50:36.540 --> 50:40.060
Actually, I took my first day off of work ever today.

50:40.060 --> 50:41.500
It's my second year to come here.

50:41.500 --> 50:41.980
Shit, nice.

50:41.980 --> 50:46.700
Yeah.

50:46.700 --> 50:47.180
Okay.

50:47.180 --> 50:49.100
We need you more than those kids do.

50:49.100 --> 50:49.820
Yeah, I'll be fine.

50:50.780 --> 50:53.740
So I stay at work really late, like 7, 7.30.

50:53.740 --> 50:55.100
I left at 8.45 the other day.

50:55.100 --> 50:55.740
It's bad.

50:55.740 --> 50:59.100
And it's often just me and the custodial staff.

50:59.100 --> 50:59.420
Right.

50:59.420 --> 51:02.700
And, you know, teacher, you just have to go to the bathroom all day.

51:02.700 --> 51:03.900
That's sort of your day.

51:03.900 --> 51:04.540
Wait, wait.

51:05.740 --> 51:08.060
Finally, a job I can sink my teeth into.

51:08.060 --> 51:12.860
You don't mean, you mean you feel the desire to go to the bathroom all day,

51:12.860 --> 51:15.740
not you just go to the bathroom all day, right?

51:15.740 --> 51:16.220
Yeah.

51:16.220 --> 51:16.700
Okay.

51:16.700 --> 51:18.460
So like, the end of the day hits.

51:18.460 --> 51:19.740
I'm like, I got to go to the bathroom.

51:19.740 --> 51:24.540
So I'll go to the bathroom and sometimes I'll come out and make eye contact with the custodian

51:24.540 --> 51:25.340
about to go.

51:25.340 --> 51:27.100
Like, enjoy my work.

51:27.100 --> 51:27.900
Clean, yes.

51:27.900 --> 51:30.860
Yeah, I'll have fun doing some Zodiac killer.

51:30.860 --> 51:34.460
Have you found her walking out saying, don't worry, I did a very good job.

51:34.460 --> 51:35.660
No, no, no, no.

51:35.660 --> 51:36.860
It doesn't matter, right?

51:36.860 --> 51:38.140
It doesn't matter, right, AJ?

51:38.140 --> 51:43.420
Because if I'm understanding correctly, I know I'm getting ahead, but like, no matter

51:43.420 --> 51:48.140
how good of a job you do in there, if you're the last person they see, you're responsible

51:48.140 --> 51:49.820
for all crime in the bathroom.

51:49.820 --> 51:54.060
Yeah, it's like, do I wait until after they've cleaned it and be like, hey, I'm going to

51:54.060 --> 51:54.860
go to the bathroom.

51:54.860 --> 51:56.540
No, no, no.

51:56.540 --> 51:57.980
Nasty, nasty monster.

51:57.980 --> 51:59.420
I know that's the wrong answer.

51:59.420 --> 52:01.500
I'm just saying that's my quandary.

52:01.500 --> 52:05.500
This is a thing, this happens to me all the time because we tour a lot and we stay in

52:05.500 --> 52:11.260
hotels and every, like, I always seem to time leaving my hotel room with, as the cleaning

52:11.260 --> 52:16.780
staff is right outside my door, and I will look at them and then just put the privacy

52:16.780 --> 52:19.180
police on the handle like, you don't have to worry about it.

52:19.180 --> 52:19.660
Please, please.

52:19.660 --> 52:21.420
I'm so sorry about everything.

52:22.300 --> 52:23.580
I made coffee in there.

52:23.580 --> 52:24.620
I feel terrible.

52:24.620 --> 52:28.540
It is, the situation you described of going after is what I run into at the airport a

52:28.540 --> 52:35.260
lot when I am sprinting towards the restroom as I want to do, and they have the little

52:35.260 --> 52:39.900
sign up like, hold on, you can't go in here, we're doing our work, and I feel so bad in

52:39.900 --> 52:45.340
the opposite arrangement where I'm like, I'm going to, I'm going to wreck it, thank you.

52:48.700 --> 52:51.820
So, there's really not a good order of operations here.

52:52.460 --> 52:56.060
Maybe you could clean the bathroom when you're done, so then when they go in, they're like,

52:56.060 --> 52:59.260
dang, and you're like, thanks, that one's on me.

52:59.900 --> 53:01.260
Could you grade these papers?

53:01.260 --> 53:05.820
It's, ideally you should do that when you do your stuff anyway.

53:05.820 --> 53:07.180
Clean the whole bathroom.

53:07.180 --> 53:09.660
Well, at least maintain your own fortress.

53:11.740 --> 53:14.540
Maybe come out and say, I used the second stall.

53:14.540 --> 53:16.780
I think you'll appreciate my thorough cleaning.

53:18.300 --> 53:18.780
Sign it.

53:21.820 --> 53:25.740
Yeah, if you find out an answer, will you let us know?

53:25.740 --> 53:30.220
Yeah, usually what I do is I'll go into the break room, and if he's in there, I'll just

53:30.220 --> 53:33.180
like walk to the bathroom and pretend that's why I came in and leave.

53:33.180 --> 53:34.620
Yeah, yeah, that's a good one.

53:34.620 --> 53:35.180
Just go home.

53:35.740 --> 53:38.140
I was worried you were going to use the bathroom in the break room.

53:38.140 --> 53:39.900
I was also worried about that.

53:39.900 --> 53:42.140
There's a, there's a ficus in there that I really hate.

53:43.900 --> 53:44.700
Does that help?

53:44.700 --> 53:45.180
Absolutely.

53:45.180 --> 53:46.060
Thank you, Adrian.

53:46.060 --> 53:46.380
Thank you.

53:48.540 --> 53:51.900
Hello, hi, my name is Matt S. Matt Ceriani.

53:51.900 --> 53:52.700
Hi Matt.

53:52.700 --> 53:53.420
Hello.

53:53.420 --> 53:54.460
What is your question?

53:54.460 --> 53:56.540
Well, I also broke the rules and put in multiple.

53:56.540 --> 54:00.780
Jesus, Matt, you had one about a band you might've used to be in.

54:00.780 --> 54:01.980
Oh yes.

54:01.980 --> 54:08.060
Tomorrow I'm playing a show and the band that I was in for two years and I left them

54:08.780 --> 54:12.780
by ghosting them is, is also playing that night.

54:12.780 --> 54:14.540
I'm actually opening for them.

54:21.660 --> 54:23.580
A sumptuous feast.

54:23.580 --> 54:27.740
Now, Matt, I'm so glad that you're at the microphone for this one.

54:28.380 --> 54:31.260
You've got to walk me through the timeline of how that happened

54:31.260 --> 54:35.100
because I'm worried at some point you knowingly agreed to that.

54:37.740 --> 54:41.500
Well, I think I left the band in, oh man.

54:41.500 --> 54:45.180
You ghosted them so fucking hard that you don't know you left the band?

54:45.180 --> 54:47.980
One day you just realized you weren't in it anymore.

54:47.980 --> 54:48.460
Yeah.

54:48.460 --> 54:50.780
No, that's kind of more or less how it happened.

54:50.780 --> 54:54.220
No, July I think was when I decided for myself I wasn't in the band anymore.

54:54.220 --> 54:55.740
That's so recent, Matt.

54:55.740 --> 54:56.460
I know.

54:58.060 --> 55:00.460
I just started playing music on my own.

55:00.460 --> 55:02.140
I knew it was going to happen eventually.

55:02.140 --> 55:03.820
I didn't think it was going to happen this soon.

55:03.820 --> 55:05.900
Wait, are you a solo act?

55:05.900 --> 55:07.420
Yeah, but I have a full band behind me.

55:07.420 --> 55:08.140
Oh, okay.

55:08.140 --> 55:13.020
I thought that you were just going to be there in like the dressing room area with them

55:13.020 --> 55:17.340
and they might even get confused as to why you were not also going on stage with them.

55:17.340 --> 55:21.020
And then they would be like, oh right, Matt doesn't work here anymore.

55:21.820 --> 55:28.060
Matt, is it a situation where they have gotten wildly, profoundly successful?

55:28.060 --> 55:29.100
Is it Coldplay?

55:29.100 --> 55:30.940
Is Coldplay the band that you left last?

55:32.140 --> 55:33.420
Fortunately for me, not.

55:33.420 --> 55:33.740
Okay, good.

55:33.740 --> 55:35.500
Otherwise I'd be even more embarrassed.

55:35.500 --> 55:36.220
Right, right.

55:36.220 --> 55:40.460
And then this would also be like a Machiavellian sort of plot to get revenge on.

55:40.460 --> 55:43.980
How do you feel about the fact that you are opening for them?

55:43.980 --> 55:50.060
I was going to say, Matt, like you left the band and now you're opening for them.

55:50.060 --> 55:52.700
I don't think you have to feel uncomfortable.

55:53.420 --> 55:57.340
Like, it seems like if I'm in that band, I'm like, teach that guy.

55:58.300 --> 55:59.820
I guess he was wrong and we were right.

55:59.820 --> 56:02.300
Hey, Matt, play all their songs.

56:02.300 --> 56:02.860
There we go.

56:09.500 --> 56:10.060
I could.

56:11.180 --> 56:13.180
Make them learn new shit on the spot.

56:13.180 --> 56:18.220
I want them to come out and be like, anyway, you put the lime in the coconut.

56:19.340 --> 56:19.900
Anything?

56:19.900 --> 56:20.620
Is that something?

56:20.620 --> 56:26.620
I'm just going to walk on stage and be like, hey, I'm a insert band's name cover band.

56:26.620 --> 56:28.220
Yeah, that's pretty good.

56:28.220 --> 56:30.460
You could also say that you're still in the band.

56:30.460 --> 56:35.900
You're just way, way, way, way, way, way off tempo.

56:35.900 --> 56:46.060
Well, you're rushing a lot by about 45 minutes.

56:47.180 --> 56:49.740
Just keep saying like, I don't know where the rest of them are.

56:51.500 --> 56:52.940
Maybe they're in the bathroom.

56:52.940 --> 56:53.980
Here's another one.

56:53.980 --> 56:56.540
Just keep getting more air and be like, this is feeling good.

56:56.540 --> 56:57.500
Let's keep rocking.

56:58.060 --> 57:00.780
I'm just going to keep this set going all night long.

57:00.780 --> 57:05.980
When they come in and say, and this is my closing act, and then walk on stage.

57:05.980 --> 57:06.540
Does that help?

57:07.100 --> 57:07.820
Absolutely.

57:07.820 --> 57:08.620
Thank you, Matt.

57:08.620 --> 57:12.060
I feel like we just dragged you for a while, but thank you for saying it helped.

57:14.380 --> 57:14.860
Hello.

57:15.500 --> 57:16.060
Hi.

57:16.060 --> 57:16.700
How's it going?

57:16.700 --> 57:19.420
Hey, is that a McElroy family branded fanny pack?

57:19.420 --> 57:20.620
It sure is.

57:20.620 --> 57:23.340
Wow, are those available at McElroyMerch.com?

57:23.340 --> 57:23.980
All right.

57:23.980 --> 57:28.140
I bet those are so convenient for carrying around, say, dice or snacks.

57:28.140 --> 57:29.740
We've already got their money.

57:29.740 --> 57:30.940
The Pepto-Bismol.

57:30.940 --> 57:31.980
Pepto-Bismol.

57:31.980 --> 57:32.940
Hey, now.

57:32.940 --> 57:35.340
We should have an official sponsorship deal with them.

57:35.340 --> 57:36.460
Does that come with them?

57:38.220 --> 57:39.100
It may as well.

57:39.740 --> 57:40.300
Anyway, hi.

57:40.300 --> 57:41.740
What's your name and question?

57:42.620 --> 57:43.660
Hi, my name is Rachel.

57:43.660 --> 57:44.380
She, her, hers.

57:44.380 --> 57:45.020
Thank you, Rachel.

57:45.580 --> 57:48.620
So I'm a server at a hibachi restaurant.

57:48.620 --> 57:50.540
I've worked there for three and a half years.

57:50.540 --> 57:53.660
And per the yuge, they do the cool onion volcano and things.

57:54.380 --> 57:56.300
A waste of an onion, according to some people.

57:56.300 --> 57:57.980
There are better ways to cook the onion.

57:57.980 --> 57:58.620
Thank you, Travis.

57:58.620 --> 58:00.140
We can't re-litigate this.

58:03.820 --> 58:06.060
I want to do cool tricks, too.

58:06.060 --> 58:06.560
Right.

58:07.180 --> 58:07.900
Please help me.

58:07.900 --> 58:08.940
But you're not a chef.

58:09.580 --> 58:10.380
Absolutely not.

58:10.380 --> 58:12.060
You're a server at the restaurant.

58:12.060 --> 58:12.780
Absolutely.

58:12.780 --> 58:15.020
Have you had training to do these things?

58:15.820 --> 58:18.540
They trained me three days and then I was on my own.

58:18.540 --> 58:19.020
Okay.

58:19.020 --> 58:20.700
Okay, but they didn't train you.

58:20.700 --> 58:21.420
Sorry, yes.

58:21.420 --> 58:22.540
I think you misunderstand.

58:22.540 --> 58:23.020
To flip things.

58:23.020 --> 58:23.740
To flip shit.

58:23.740 --> 58:25.740
They trained you just to flip things.

58:25.740 --> 58:29.260
They trained you to be a server and not spill drinks on people.

58:29.260 --> 58:32.460
Not how to, I don't know, spin a plate on your nose.

58:33.020 --> 58:33.260
Yeah.

58:33.260 --> 58:35.180
Can you go to wherever you took the training and say like,

58:35.180 --> 58:39.260
I'm ready for the master course where you teach me to slide

58:39.260 --> 58:42.380
somebody's wine glass off of a sharp knife onto the table.

58:42.380 --> 58:45.580
I don't know what kind of these tricks look like.

58:46.620 --> 58:48.540
Listen, I say you got to walk before you can run.

58:49.180 --> 58:51.500
You just need to start doing the tricks.

58:51.500 --> 58:53.100
And at first you won't be good at it.

58:53.100 --> 58:53.900
None of us are.

58:53.900 --> 58:55.980
And very quickly you'll lose your job.

58:55.980 --> 58:56.780
That's fine.

58:56.780 --> 58:58.460
But then you'll get another job.

58:59.100 --> 59:01.340
And you'll do a little bit better there.

59:01.340 --> 59:03.180
And you can say, and you don't have to tell them,

59:03.180 --> 59:06.540
you can say one of my pride as a server at this place

59:06.540 --> 59:09.340
is that I never try to do any hibachi tricks.

59:09.340 --> 59:10.940
And that's never been a problem for me.

59:10.940 --> 59:13.660
And I don't expect it to be one at this facility.

59:13.660 --> 59:14.860
Fucking day one.

59:15.500 --> 59:17.740
You're just flipping shrimp into people's mouths,

59:17.740 --> 59:18.620
higgledy-piggledy.

59:18.620 --> 59:20.540
There's lots of other restaurants you could try out.

59:20.540 --> 59:22.460
You could just hand them an empty glass

59:22.460 --> 59:24.060
and you have the pitcher of water.

59:24.060 --> 59:27.340
And you say, now I'm going to stand back as far as I can

59:27.340 --> 59:28.540
and fill that glass.

59:28.540 --> 59:30.540
And then just throw the water up into the air.

59:30.540 --> 59:32.620
Or into your open mouth.

59:32.620 --> 59:35.100
Just holler when you get a powerful thirst going.

59:35.100 --> 59:35.740
Do you do that?

59:35.740 --> 59:38.220
Like, if you're the server at one of those places,

59:38.220 --> 59:39.820
can you be like, oh, you need some ketchup?

59:39.820 --> 59:40.540
No problem.

59:40.540 --> 59:41.740
Just toss it behind your back,

59:41.740 --> 59:42.620
catch it in your front.

59:42.620 --> 59:43.980
Like, add a little pizzazz.

59:43.980 --> 59:46.060
Yeah, you could do some like cocktail stuff, you know?

59:46.060 --> 59:46.860
Exactly.

59:46.860 --> 59:48.460
Some knife throwing into the table.

59:48.460 --> 59:50.780
Now, you just look horrified at that.

59:50.780 --> 59:52.220
This is your idea.

59:53.180 --> 59:55.660
We are not even, yes, ending.

59:55.660 --> 59:56.940
We're just saying, yes.

59:56.940 --> 59:58.460
You know what would be a badass trick?

59:58.460 --> 01:00:00.860
Turn the table all the way up on heat or whatever.

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:02.220
And then walk up and just say,

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:03.820
I hope you all enjoy your food tonight.

01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:08.620
Stone-faced.

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:09.900
Put your hand right on the table.

01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:11.900
Go into the sunken, like, you don't feel it.

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:17.580
I don't feel it.

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:20.700
I do have one thing that usually gets people

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:21.980
that people don't expect.

01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:25.260
So we take the order and we turn it into the chefs.

01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:26.780
We're like, here's the food.

01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:29.260
And then we go take the soups out to the table.

01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:30.780
And it's, they're hot.

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:31.260
Like, they're-

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:31.980
Like soup is.

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:32.780
Yeah, got you.

01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:34.060
Like 98.5% of soup is.

01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:35.180
They are hot.

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:37.420
And people see that they're steaming.

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:39.820
And so it really annoys them that we have to say

01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:40.540
that they're hot.

01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:44.060
So when I hand them out, I take the first two

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:46.460
and I set them to my left and I go,

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:50.860
guys, I just want to let you know the soup is soup or hot.

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:52.380
That's not a trick.

01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:55.500
No.

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:57.740
It's fucking so funny, obviously.

01:00:57.740 --> 01:00:59.660
Listen, that rules.

01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:00.380
Yeah, it's very good.

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:00.860
Don't get me wrong.

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:03.500
But it tripped with me, like if you handed them

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.740
the bowls upside down and flipped it over

01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:07.100
and it was full of soup.

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:08.860
That's an awesome trick.

01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:11.100
Or if you said, you know what else is super hot?

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:17.020
And then you put your hand on the fucking hibachi table.

01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:18.140
Or you hand them that.

01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:20.780
And at the bottom of it is a note that has their name

01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:22.620
and social security number on it.

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:24.460
Because here's the thing.

01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:26.060
I don't know how much you can flip,

01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:28.700
but you can become a mentalist.

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:29.340
And it's-

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:31.260
Listen, it's not the same kind of trick.

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:35.420
But I would say mentalism is like the hibachi of magic.

01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:38.700
Yeah, man, for sure.

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:40.540
Does that help?

01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:41.580
It helps so much.

01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:42.140
Thank you.

01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:42.700
Thank you.

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:44.220
No, thank you.

01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:47.740
Hello.

01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:49.100
Hi.

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:51.100
You can angle that up if you want.

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:51.580
No problem.

01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:52.140
Just point the microphone.

01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:52.940
Yeah, you got it.

01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:54.220
Hi, I'm Jake.

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:55.020
Hi, Jake.

01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:55.660
Jake.

01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:58.700
Short while back, I requested some time off

01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:00.940
and my boss gave it to me even though I didn't have

01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:01.980
vacation time to use.

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:07.180
It was about 5.36 in the morning after a 13-hour shift

01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:08.940
and I was very tired.

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:10.380
And when he went to shake my hand,

01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:12.460
I panicked and I hugged him.

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:14.860
Nice choice.

01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:15.360
Right.

01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:19.660
How do I erase this from his memory?

01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:20.160
Right.

01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:23.740
And how do I overcome my new fear of handshakes?

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:24.240
Yeah.

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:26.700
Yeah, I mean, you can practice that.

01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.780
There's some YouTube tutorials about how to land

01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:30.540
that in particular spacecraft.

01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:36.380
So this is a lot like kind of calling your teacher mommy.

01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:36.880
Yes.

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:41.740
On that note, do you want to hear where it gets worse?

01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:42.240
Yeah.

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.500
You called your boss mommy?

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:46.780
No, I may have accidentally thanked him by saying

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:49.020
thanks for getting me off those days.

01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:49.520
Jake.

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:50.020
OK.

01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:50.520
All right.

01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:56.080
Cool, Jake.

01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:57.600
Cool, Jake.

01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:04.160
Cool, Jake.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.580
I am 100% not lying to you.

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:07.080
I know.

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:09.380
You need to leave here.

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:13.260
You didn't need to clarify that you weren't lying.

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.620
We knew.

01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:15.340
You can tell.

01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:22.700
I had a rather emotional little speech lined up

01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:30.140
about how a hug can be nice with consent

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:32.700
and then maybe it just brought you two closer

01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:34.780
and maybe it was special.

01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:40.300
But then you talked about how you did kind of a jizz joke.

01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:43.420
And now I don't feel like my thing is going

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:47.860
to cut the mustard anymore.

01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:49.580
There was definitely an avenue.

01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:51.340
I was going to ask, did he hug you back?

01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:53.660
Was it a nice moment?

01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:55.620
I do actually need to know this information.

01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:57.420
Yeah, did he hug you back?

01:03:57.420 --> 01:03:59.860
So it was kind of like an awkward side hug at first.

01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:02.220
A Christian side hug, yes.

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:04.180
And then we shook hands over it.

01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:05.980
Oh my god.

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:07.580
Oh no.

01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:08.860
It's the worst possible.

01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:11.620
I would have sooner you'd be stabbed in the flank

01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:12.860
with a switchblade.

01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:16.860
Did you then accidentally pull his arm off?

01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:18.900
And then you yanked out his pants.

01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:19.820
Like, what happened?

01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:22.220
And then your pants fell down.

01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:23.700
Holy shit, Jake.

01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:27.380
God, Jake, you fucked up so bad.

01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:28.140
OK.

01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:29.780
You should have asked us before.

01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:32.460
Or we could have done something.

01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:40.300
So my original question still holds.

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:43.220
Did he hug you back at any point?

01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:45.820
I mean, he put one arm back around my back, too, I guess.

01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:47.860
It was the weirdest kind of like.

01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:50.340
Yeah, it was the weirdest imaginable hug.

01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:52.900
Yes, we've established.

01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:57.060
You might have actually reached a point that weren't going

01:04:57.060 --> 01:05:01.900
to him and saying, I also know how bad that was.

01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:05.780
We are past the point of joking now, Jake.

01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:10.100
I'm worried about you and this other person who

01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:11.500
both of you were in this moment.

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:14.700
I'm filing a complaint with HR, not against you or myself,

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:16.380
but against the moment.

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:18.060
Yeah.

01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:21.620
Like, you should both be mad at fate and what it made you

01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:22.140
both do.

01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:23.580
For bringing you together.

01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:25.020
A lot of people talk about serendipity

01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:26.220
like it's always a good thing.

01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:27.700
Nope.

01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:28.860
Sometimes it gets you.

01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:32.540
Sometimes two human bodies interlock in such a way

01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:35.660
that it butterfly effects out and causes World War III.

01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:36.180
Have you?

01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:37.540
It's not a butterfly effect.

01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:39.580
It got you immediately.

01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:41.100
It was a bee effect.

01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:44.260
You put your hands together on top of a bee and it got you.

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:45.740
So Jacob, where do you work now?

01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:51.700
That's actually the thing is that my job pays too much

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:53.660
to leave, so I'm kind of stuck in this money

01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:56.020
trap and this, you know, nightmare.

01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:59.460
This seems like a question less about human intimacy

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:01.740
and more about power dynamics, which

01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:06.940
is to say you're going to have to be the boss somehow.

01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:09.900
And then you can say, now that I'm the boss,

01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:12.780
what was up with that hug?

01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:13.380
You're fired.

01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:19.540
Jacob, you should apologize for this hug.

01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:20.100
Yes.

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:21.460
It's not for jokes in the past.

01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:22.500
You must apologize.

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:23.140
Unless.

01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:23.660
No.

01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:25.140
Jokes is left around.

01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:27.100
Jokes, get out of here.

01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:27.620
Unless.

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:29.180
Jokes, step off the stage.

01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:31.620
Jokes, come on back up.

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:32.740
Jokes waiting in the wings.

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:33.900
Come on down.

01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:37.860
Can you establish this as like your secret handshake

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:40.580
with the boss?

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:43.700
Would you perhaps have any friends in the office

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:45.940
that you can repeat this with in front of the boss?

01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:48.380
And the boss is like, oh, it turns out it's not weird.

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:49.020
Yeah.

01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:51.740
Jake's just weird.

01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:56.180
Should we do the normal 2019 handshake for millennials

01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:58.340
and hip dads?

01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:02.300
Hey, jokes off the stage.

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:04.460
You can't just hug people.

01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:05.580
Yes, also that, Jake.

01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:07.060
It's 2019.

01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:08.740
You have to apologize.

01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:09.620
It was an accident.

01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:10.260
It happened.

01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:13.180
You must apologize for the hug, Jacob.

01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:15.500
I would agree with Justin already

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:18.780
if it didn't go beyond just hugging someone to invading

01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:21.100
both their space and psyche.

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:24.180
And at this point, their privacy.

01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:28.980
There's 3,000 people here.

01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:31.420
Jake, do you promise you'll apologize for the hug?

01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:31.900
Yeah.

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:32.620
And you are dismissed.

01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:33.220
Thank you.

01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:33.940
Thank you, Jake.

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:37.900
That's it.

01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:39.460
All right, you can lower the house lights.

01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:39.940
Thank you.

01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:43.940
Once Jacob is safely nestled, I don't want him to trip.

01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:48.140
No, that would be the worst thing to ever happen to Jake.

01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:49.300
Jake, get nice and cozy.

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:49.780
We'll wait.

01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:50.300
Yes, thank you.

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:50.780
All right.

01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:52.020
Now, Jake, is it cozy?

01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:52.300
Good.

01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:52.900
All warmed up?

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:53.380
You good?

01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:55.540
Like a nice, warm hug?

01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:57.340
You don't have a microphone anymore, Jake.

01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:58.940
The power's all back here.

01:07:58.940 --> 01:07:59.460
All right.

01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:01.060
If you could go ahead and turn their lights.

01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:01.060
Make Jake disappear.

01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:02.180
Make them go away.

01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:03.300
There are too many of them.

01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:03.620
I can't.

01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:04.140
Goodbye.

01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:04.660
Stop waving.

01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:05.460
You monsters.

01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:07.260
Brigadoon.

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:10.100
Thank you so much for having us here at your beautiful theater.

01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:15.860
And I will also say, your beautiful town.

01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:17.820
Yes, Brooklyn.

01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:19.180
Hell of a town.

01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:22.620
Hey, if you don't have anything going on tomorrow,

01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:25.420
we're coming back.

01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:27.220
We might just sleep in the green room.

01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:27.940
Yeah.

01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:29.420
Doing all the same jokes.

01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:30.700
Jake's going to be here.

01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:31.980
It's going to be fucking lit.

01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:34.740
There's a few of you that aren't so far.

01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:37.500
And it would be cool if all of you did.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:38.940
Thank you.

01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:40.540
If you could just come to that show,

01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:41.180
we'd really appreciate it.

01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:42.460
Or maybe just tell a friend.

01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:43.980
Say, I went last night.

01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:46.140
It was great and not at all awkward.

01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:51.420
We have beautiful posters designed by Carrie Peach

01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:54.820
out in the lobby that are so, so beautiful.

01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:57.340
If you bought one or got any kind of merch on your way out,

01:08:57.340 --> 01:09:01.340
you can grab a sticker for free on your way out.

01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:03.020
They become the monster tour sticker.

01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:05.460
Yes, Paul is texting me this information as we speak.

01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:08.420
He also says not to stick them to anything in the theater.

01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:11.940
So Paul's a cop.

01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:14.260
We also want to say thank you to Sawbones for opening for us.

01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:17.340
Yeah.

01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:18.220
We got a book, too.

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:19.300
It's called The Sawbones Book.

01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:21.340
You buy it on Amazon or maybe in the hallway.

01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:22.500
I don't know.

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:25.260
Also, speaking of books, pre-orders for book three

01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:28.300
of The Adventure Zone, Pebbles to the Metal.

01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:28.780
Yes.

01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:29.740
That is available now.

01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:30.660
You can go to The Adventure.

01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:32.180
Well, the pre-order is available now.

01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:33.580
That was a bad way of phrasing it.

01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:35.580
You can go to theadventurezonecomic.com

01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:36.380
and pre-order it now.

01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:37.860
It will be out in July.

01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:38.780
But why wait?

01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:39.700
Yeah.

01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:41.740
And go to our YouTube channel.

01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:43.580
We announced the new season of Adventure Zone today

01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:44.620
that Travis is running.

01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:48.380
It's very exciting.

01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:51.700
It's a really cool trailer, and you'll like it.

01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:53.380
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:54.380
for the use of a theme song.

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:57.620
It's a departure off the album, Playing the Days to Bed.

01:09:57.620 --> 01:10:01.900
We have a whole trek back down to, like, I don't know.

01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:04.060
We're staying in downtown, and we're doing this show here

01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:05.460
because we're bad at planning.

01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:06.820
So we won't be able to hang out.

01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:08.220
We're very good at planning.

01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:09.260
We designed it this way.

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:11.540
We're staying in a building where they do Tootsie, all right?

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:12.940
We're staying in the middle of the city.

01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:14.300
We're staying in the building.

01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:14.980
This is not a joke.

01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:16.300
We're staying in the building where

01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:18.940
we did the blue carpet premiere of Margaritaville.

01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:21.900
We have to see.

01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:24.780
We have to still chalk outlines of everything.

01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:26.460
Right.

01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:28.460
So we won't be able to hang out of this show.

01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:29.620
But we'll be here tomorrow.

01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:30.100
It's cool.

01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:31.300
Just come see us tomorrow.

01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:33.140
Tomorrow's like the after party of this show.

01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:33.980
Right.

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:37.620
This final Yahoo was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:41.420
Thank you, Adrian, wherever you are.

01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:46.500
It's from Yahoo Answers user Crisp Kringle, who asks,

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:50.100
does Subway have secret bologna?

01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:54.820
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:55.580
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:56.500
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:57.740
It's been my brother, my brother, me,

01:10:57.740 --> 01:10:59.500
kiss your dad's square on the lips.

01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:16.780
Hey, girls, do you want to say, hey, I want to?

01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:18.540
Maximumfun.org.

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:19.940
Comedy and culture.

01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:21.100

Audience-supported.

01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:24.780
Hey, I'm Janet Varney.

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:28.100
And like many of you, some more recent than others,

01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:30.100
I used to be a teenager.

01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:31.740
In fact, just about all of my friends

01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:35.700
were, too, including wonderful women like Alison Brie.

01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:37.820
I'm dead center on the balance beam.

01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:39.500
And this is like a big gym.

01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:42.060
All the kids' parents are there watching.

01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:44.100
I have to stop, like when you have to pee so bad

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:45.060
and you can't even move.

01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:46.460
And then I just go.

01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:51.100
I just pee right in the middle of the high balance beam.

01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:53.660
So join me every week on the JV Club podcast,

01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:56.900
where I speak with complicated, funny, messy humans

01:11:56.900 --> 01:11:58.660
as we reminisce about our adolescences

01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:01.380
and how they led us to becoming who we are.

01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:27.540
Find it every Thursday on Maximum Fun.
