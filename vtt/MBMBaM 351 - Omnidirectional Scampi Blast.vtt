00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:49.040
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:49.760 --> 00:55.360
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:55.360 --> 00:59.360
What are you- why? Are you- why are we doing- why are we making the long pauses happen?

00:59.360 --> 01:02.880
My pause is because I couldn't remember what I said there.

01:02.880 --> 01:06.320
Mine was because I wanted anticipatory ASMR tingles.

01:06.320 --> 01:10.640
All right, my name is- I'm Griffin- I'm the sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy,

01:11.280 --> 01:22.560
and it's time to retire, I guess, my- my honorific. It's time to hang up the fucking- my old- my now

01:22.560 --> 01:29.840
old person hat that an old person wears, no longer 30 under 30 media luminary Griffin McElroy.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.600
Oh, Griffin, I hadn't even thought about this.

01:31.600 --> 01:37.200
The Forbes- the Forbes goon squad came, and they fucking smashed in my door,

01:37.200 --> 01:42.400
crashed all my windows, they knocked over a load-bearing wall, and just came into my fucking

01:42.400 --> 01:47.040
house, and they took my fucking plaque away, and I immediately dried up and aged like the guy at

01:47.040 --> 01:52.960
the end of The Last Crusade so bad. Griffin, what's it like to be in the no man's land, betwixt

01:52.960 --> 02:02.800
30 under 30 and 30 over 30? It's- it's strange to be here. Um, uh, I don't like- like they- I- I-

02:02.800 --> 02:07.120
I'm sorry, Travis, I wanted to play- I want to play with you in this joke, but I'm just thinking

02:07.120 --> 02:12.000
about how bad I miss my very good plaque that I used to have. The Forbes came, and they fucking

02:12.000 --> 02:15.680
took it away from me, and I was like, but wait, don't you want to hear about the latest media

02:15.680 --> 02:20.000
trends? And they were like, you don't know fucking shit, and then they hit me with the plaque twice

02:20.560 --> 02:26.240
in my- on my back, like the- like a folding chair in a wrestling game, and I fell out- I fell to the

02:26.240 --> 02:30.400
ground, and when I fell to the ground, of course both my knees shattered because I'm an old man now,

02:31.120 --> 02:36.880
and so that's where I'm at. I'm actually recording this- actually it's April 15th, I have two- two

02:36.880 --> 02:43.040
sweet days left of sweet 20-something vitality, and I don't know- I don't know what to fucking do with

02:43.040 --> 02:47.040
it. Here's how I spent my last 48 hours of 20-something vitality. I just watched a giraffe

02:47.040 --> 02:52.320
fall out of another giraffe, and people were like so psyched. You don't know about this fucking giraffe?

02:53.520 --> 02:58.080
No, you say that. There's been a non-stop live stream of this giraffe who's about to give birth

02:58.080 --> 03:03.040
for like a month, and it's like, that's how you're spending your day, huh? Okay, but then I did want

03:03.040 --> 03:06.400
to be part of the zeitgeist because I heard this giraffe was finally popping, and I watched a

03:06.400 --> 03:10.880
giraffe fall out of another giraffe with my last few precious moments of 20-something vitality.

03:10.880 --> 03:17.280
I don't know how I feel about that. It's not good. It's just really wet. It's really, really gummy.

03:18.480 --> 03:23.520
I think the good thing about being- to going from your 20s to your 30s is like, when you're at the

03:23.520 --> 03:28.320
end of your 20s, you feel like, oh god, my 20s are over. I'll never be the same. And then when you get

03:28.320 --> 03:33.520
to your 30s, like, oh, these things are just beginning. It's like putting on a fresh pair of

03:33.520 --> 03:41.440
sleep pants. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a really apt comparison, though. Yeah. Can we get

03:41.440 --> 03:45.920
back to privacy issues with giraffes, please? Because that's what I want to do. Everybody's

03:45.920 --> 03:52.080
very upset if anybody hacks their webcam, but we're all fine just like- Scoping at giraffes.

03:52.080 --> 04:00.560
Yeah. It's a very intimate time. Yeah. This is really troubling me. Can you put a GoPro on a

04:00.560 --> 04:07.600
baby giraffe in utero so you get that first person like, whoa, that giraffe water slide kind of effect

04:07.600 --> 04:13.040
going? I just, I really don't want to think about or talk about the giraffe anymore. Okay, that's

04:13.040 --> 04:18.240
fine. I just, boys, I'm struggling a little bit because I look back at 20 year old- You're talking

04:18.240 --> 04:25.520
to your two older brothers. Yeah, I have zero pity. Oh, Griffin. Oh, you're so old. Fuck off.

04:25.520 --> 04:33.120
Yeah. I've had to deal with almost four years of even if I sleep eight hours waking up feeling

04:33.120 --> 04:38.880
like shit and my back hurts if I sit in a chair wrong, Griffin. See, I still have that coming,

04:38.880 --> 04:45.280
though, and I don't want it. I don't want to be achy all the time like you did. I actually have,

04:45.280 --> 04:52.160
can I tell you a new thing? This is my new break. Yeah, break me off a fucking teaser

04:52.160 --> 04:57.120
trailer of what 36 is going to be like for me. No, this is actually a really good life plan.

04:57.680 --> 05:03.360
I've been overweight my whole life, right? And then in my mid 30s, I started to feel some of

05:03.360 --> 05:11.520
those like age rundown kind of feelings. And so I just started to like take up Taekwondo and try

05:11.520 --> 05:18.480
to exercise and eat better and start losing weight. So my new thing is this, don't be fit

05:18.480 --> 05:26.000
when you're young. And if you if you're unhealthy when you're young and then start getting healthy

05:26.000 --> 05:33.200
as you age, you can keep I plan to keep a perfect equilibrium like as my body degrades. Essentially,

05:33.200 --> 05:39.440
I will also train it. You've been training for your whole life on Dagobah with Yoda on your back

05:39.440 --> 05:43.920
and then you've done some Taekwondo to drop the Yoda and all of a sudden you can jump a little

05:43.920 --> 05:49.040
bit higher. And also Dagobah is falling apart and has hair in weird places like to complete

05:49.040 --> 05:54.640
the metaphor. To be fair, Justin, that is what Dagobah is. I've seen the movie. Yeah, it's a lot

05:54.640 --> 06:00.400
like what Dagobah is. All right, well, I'll keep that. I mean, I've probably put on about 20 pounds

06:00.400 --> 06:05.040
since I had a baby. So that's good. That's good to know. I'm fucking cramming that Dagobah.

06:05.600 --> 06:09.920
You just got to put your baby on your back and do some somersaults and swing through the forest.

06:09.920 --> 06:16.480
Baby would fucking love that. Are you kidding me? It's like I'm like a big fun jungle gym ride. God,

06:16.480 --> 06:21.600
30 though. I can't record this podcast right now. I need to go. No, fuck you guys. I need to go get

06:21.600 --> 06:26.080
on my razor scooter for one last time before I have to go throw it into a volcano on Monday.

06:26.720 --> 06:31.200
But to be fair, when you do that, you will end the curse. So yes, we'll all be free.

06:31.200 --> 06:38.240
It's just so sad. I know. While Griffin tries to recuperate, you know what? I got a

06:39.200 --> 06:44.240
Starbucks double shot energy Mexican mocha today because I thought that would be an enjoyable

06:44.240 --> 06:49.040
cheat day beverage for this recording. Is it not? I'm getting some severe tackiness on my palate

06:49.040 --> 06:58.080
that is making elocution a challenge. Well, what's the next steps? There's no and so.

06:58.080 --> 07:02.640
We can pause the recording for 45 minutes for you to do like a flush.

07:04.240 --> 07:10.960
A quick cleanse? Guys, I'm just looking at the box in the corner of my office where all my Yu-Gi-Oh

07:10.960 --> 07:15.440
cards are and I just know I'm going to have to get rid of them on Monday. Well, good news,

07:15.440 --> 07:22.160
girl. Actually, 12 o' one a.m. Central, they just disappear. The forest people are going to come

07:22.160 --> 07:28.240
and take my Yu-Gi-Oh cards and my plaque, my great plaque. Damn it. Why would they need a dummy plaque?

07:28.240 --> 07:37.200
You have 48 hours. I appreciate them recognizing my status as a media mogul, but like you did it

07:37.200 --> 07:43.520
just a couple months before you took my took my whole life away. I just what is there? I mean,

07:43.520 --> 07:47.120
I guess 40 under 40, but I'm going to have to do some like I'm going to have to really change up

07:47.120 --> 07:51.120
my shit like they're not going to do it for Griffin's just really good at media again. No,

07:51.120 --> 07:57.120
I have to like open up an Italian restaurant in Brooklyn that's like fucking epic that people like

07:57.120 --> 08:01.200
can't stop talking about my puttanesca. Griffin, he's transformative. He's transformed his whole

08:01.200 --> 08:05.120
scene. He used to be a good podcast boy and now he invented this puttanesca that's so spicy you

08:05.120 --> 08:10.080
got to try it 40 under 40. He did it, but even that's less prestigious because there's 10 more

08:10.080 --> 08:16.480
fucking people on the list. I don't want to share it with them. So are we about ready for questions?

08:16.480 --> 08:20.720
Are we doing a show or is this just a therapy session? I'm going to be distracted the whole

08:20.720 --> 08:25.360
show, but yeah, let's go ahead and do it. I mean my advice is just going to be like live live while

08:25.360 --> 08:34.080
you can no day, but today get out there. Okay, so here is the first question today. I was leaving

08:34.080 --> 08:39.680
my apartment to get coffee at a nearby coffee shop good place for it and my roommate was leaving

08:39.680 --> 08:44.320
at the same time to go to work. We walked out together, but when we reached the sidewalk, she

08:44.320 --> 08:50.800
said. Have to walk separate and then she walked to the other side of the street and continue to walk

08:50.800 --> 08:55.840
the next three blocks in the same direction to be at the same pace. We've lived together for several

08:55.840 --> 09:00.800
years and I wasn't one of those. It wasn't one of those awkward situations where we said goodbye

09:00.800 --> 09:05.680
only to find out we were walking in the same direction, which is the worst. I told her I

09:05.680 --> 09:12.640
was going to the coffee shop. Am I good? I don't think she's good. I think you're okay. That's from

09:12.640 --> 09:21.760
alone walking the same way in the Bay Area. Okay, I would like to say to your roommate's credit,

09:21.760 --> 09:26.800
you said your roommate is walking to work, right? So this is probably like a routine. This might be

09:26.800 --> 09:33.920
like your roommate walks to work every morning and that's like their time of like mindful walking

09:33.920 --> 09:40.640
meditation of like this is me. I walk at my pace. I'm thinking about myself. I don't want to talk to

09:40.640 --> 09:45.920
another human being. I'm just like zoning in and pumping myself up for the day. You know what I

09:45.920 --> 09:53.120
mean? And so like they just might really need that time. Travis, very charitable, very generous of

09:53.120 --> 09:59.360
spirit of you. Very nice picture you've painted. Very nice picture you've painted. It is buckwild

09:59.360 --> 10:06.160
to think that that information could be absorbed through context and not related directly. Like it

10:06.160 --> 10:12.000
is buckwild to say like I know. Listen, I'm going to veer off. I'm sure they'll assume I'm meditating

10:12.000 --> 10:16.640
on my right. It's like you have heard hoof prints and shouted zebra thinking that this person's like

10:16.640 --> 10:22.240
a fucking like bike messenger who needs to get psyched for the fucking premium rush or whatever.

10:22.240 --> 10:28.640
Like I think it's even if that's the case, like don't be rude. It's rude what you've done here.

10:28.640 --> 10:33.760
I think a little bit, maybe a little rude, maybe just a tad rude. I would like to make a prequel

10:33.760 --> 10:39.600
to Premium Rush called Economy Rush and it's about foot messengers who can't, who don't use bikes

10:39.600 --> 10:46.320
and it takes like eight times as long for your packages to arrive. I would love to watch JGL

10:46.320 --> 10:52.000
just like running a lot and getting like very sweaty in a hot city. And by like the 10th

10:52.000 --> 10:57.840
delivery he's just casually walking. I ordered this six hours ago. You should have paid for the

10:57.840 --> 11:03.760
Premium Rush, dude. You think when he, when JGL finished Premium Rush and he was watching on the

11:03.760 --> 11:09.840
screen and he thought, man, I bet this movie is going to be mentioned by one podcast on two

11:09.840 --> 11:15.360
separate episodes. I think that there's one podcast. 200 episodes apart. Yeah. I think

11:15.360 --> 11:18.560
there's one podcast that's really going to get into this flick. Can I just say though,

11:18.560 --> 11:23.840
it's a good flick. I've never seen it. You've never seen it? No. Good flick. I've

11:23.840 --> 11:28.880
never seen my comedy blind and ignorant. If you can't watch, I've watched JGL on anything.

11:28.880 --> 11:32.880
Anything. I've only seen a clip where he's about to get hit by the car, but then another car hits

11:32.880 --> 11:37.120
that car. And it's, I saw that and I was like, I don't want my Joseph to be imperiled. You know

11:37.120 --> 11:43.200
what I mean? There is, there are, it is rated PG-13 for multiple scenes of Joseph Gordon Leavitt

11:43.200 --> 11:49.200
peril. It's not. Yeah. I couldn't, I'm not interested. No, thank you. No, thanks. Couldn't,

11:49.200 --> 11:54.000
no, I watched looper and the whole time I was like, my Joseph's imperiled. I can't do it. I

11:54.000 --> 11:58.320
fucking can't do it. I know Travis had problems with that movie that I don't want him to start

11:58.320 --> 12:04.080
unpacking again. But my problem with that movie is sometimes people pointed their guns at JGL

12:04.080 --> 12:09.760
with intent to harm. And I just, I don't fuck with that. Are you kidding me? No way. Um,

12:11.200 --> 12:15.440
this is not a cool thing. I think that your roommate, it's not a nice thing of him to do.

12:15.440 --> 12:21.120
It's it's like, I get, I get like, and I'm not saying like, if you are a person who like needs

12:21.120 --> 12:27.680
that time to like recharge or, or, or whatever, or like if I, I get all that, but I also think

12:27.680 --> 12:31.920
that this is also just kind of a rude thing that happens. So well, cause the problem is,

12:31.920 --> 12:36.800
as you guys pointed out, it was not like the roommate had every opportunity to say like,

12:36.800 --> 12:43.600
cool. Um, just so you know, like I have a routine in the morning and I, I kind of need to stick to

12:43.600 --> 12:48.240
what it's going to throw off my whole day. Um, because now what's going to happen is you have

12:48.240 --> 12:55.520
to unpack this when you're both home the next time. Like, Hey, so what was that? Yeah, I know.

12:55.520 --> 13:00.400
Um, how about, so maybe they were checking the geocache. That's another possibility.

13:00.400 --> 13:04.240
Why wouldn't they take you with them on their fucking geocache adventure? Geocaching is more

13:04.240 --> 13:11.360
fun with friends. It is more fun with friends. Um, can I drop this Yahoo on y'all? Yeah. It's

13:11.360 --> 13:19.120
from Aaron keys. Thank you, Aaron. It's Yahoo answers user frosty who asks what sports did

13:19.120 --> 13:26.000
William Shakespeare like? Oh, good one. I have an English project to do and I can't find any answers

13:26.000 --> 13:30.720
to this question. Can someone tell me with a reference site? I feel like if you get on Yahoo

13:30.720 --> 13:35.360
answers for help with a school project, you're basic, like while you're typing in Yahoo answers

13:35.360 --> 13:41.840
dot bills or whatever the fuck you are telling yourself, I'm okay with a D like I'm fine getting

13:41.840 --> 13:54.240
a D on this one. I just need it done. So definitely Quidditch. Okay. If not, I think that was during

13:54.240 --> 13:59.840
wizard times. So definitely Quidditch. Yeah, definitely Quidditch. Maybe chariot racing.

14:01.600 --> 14:05.040
I mean, he definitely, I mean, he's probably here's the thing. I'm not familiar with

14:05.040 --> 14:09.120
all of the works of William Shakespeare. I've seen Romeo and Juliet, the movie obviously with

14:09.120 --> 14:15.920
Leonardo DiCaprio and I like loved it. It was very poignant in that one. And, um, that's it.

14:16.800 --> 14:20.720
I'm actually, I want you to know as someone who worked at a Shakespeare company, I'm trying to

14:20.720 --> 14:26.720
run through my head and think there's a sports one. Yeah. Is there a show? I mean, there's wrestling

14:27.600 --> 14:32.640
in, I think two gentlemen of Verona or two nobles. That's just like, that's just like,

14:32.640 --> 14:38.160
that's just like, that's just like horsing around. It's just horseplay. Let's just, let's just spit

14:38.160 --> 14:45.440
ball falconry, falconry. They had Falcons, they had gloves. Are the Falcons like catching balls and

14:45.440 --> 14:51.840
flying through usually a Frisbee, but they are, they are doing that. That's a tricky needle thread

14:51.840 --> 14:56.720
though. Cause you have to throw that Frisbee in a very particular way so that the, your Falcon

14:56.720 --> 15:03.920
intercepts it, but is not intercepted by the Frisbee. Uh, probably archery, right? That was

15:03.920 --> 15:08.480
probably a sport back then. I mean, that was just around for fucking ever. Archery was just there

15:08.480 --> 15:15.680
day to day back then. Like you had to like in, in, in London or Avon over Stratfordshire or whatever

15:15.680 --> 15:23.200
the fuck. Perfect. I think you like, I think you had to be fucking strapped with a longbow.

15:23.200 --> 15:28.000
Travis, Travis has suggested now, are we talking about football Norte Americano or are we talking

15:28.000 --> 15:34.400
about football? The origins of football, and this is absolutely true. It used to be played between

15:34.400 --> 15:42.160
two towns and the field was the size of the distance between the towns. And so the two towns

15:42.160 --> 15:48.080
would just like challenge each other. And it was everyone from this town versus everyone from this

15:48.080 --> 15:54.640
town. And it was so incredibly violent. People would like routinely die playing, like they'd get

15:54.640 --> 16:00.960
like trampled and beaten to death. Um, but it's been around forever. He was more of a gentle

16:01.600 --> 16:04.160
soul though. I don't know he'd be into that. And again, you didn't really answer my question

16:04.160 --> 16:08.080
for talking about the game with the round ball that you kick around a whole bunch of the game

16:08.080 --> 16:12.480
with the Brown sort of funny shaped ball. Brown funny shaped ball I believe. I believe they use

16:12.480 --> 16:19.360
their hands. This is a lie because as everybody knows, Joe Montana invented football as we know

16:19.360 --> 16:26.000
it today. Joe Montana is eternal. Oh, Joe Montana is an eternal person. They named Montana after him.

16:26.000 --> 16:33.600
Make sure he is still alive. Joe Montana, Joe Montana. Yeah, 60 years old looking

16:35.200 --> 16:40.080
like Joe Montana. So I think William Shakespeare would have been super and like I think he would,

16:40.080 --> 16:44.640
I think he'd be a Cowboys fan. No, I think he'd love the fucking pigskin dude. Like just like-

16:44.640 --> 16:51.280
I think he would pick the most underdog team. Oh, it's the Ravens. What am I even talking about?

16:51.280 --> 16:54.400
He would be a fan of the Ravens. Yeah dude, his fucking classic work,

16:54.400 --> 16:56.800
the Ravens. Exactly Griffin, thank you.

16:58.480 --> 17:03.200
Man, it's not often you get to be wrong about sports and poems in one episode.

17:03.200 --> 17:07.520
No, I'm just saying that fool liked birds. He wrote about birds a lot. And that seems like a

17:07.520 --> 17:11.920
shit, yeah bud. It's based on literary works and I know he didn't fucking write the Ravens.

17:13.120 --> 17:20.560
It was Wordsworth. My favorite, my favorite sonnet of Shakespeare is it goes a little bit like this.

17:22.800 --> 17:30.640
It's like boom, I put it in the hoop, like slam. I heard the crowd screaming out jam. Oh yeah.

17:30.640 --> 17:34.800
I swear I'm telling you the facts because that's how I'd be Horatio.

17:34.800 --> 17:38.240
I was like why does it rhyme? That's nothing. Can you invent Shaq?

17:39.760 --> 17:44.800
I wrote Shaq into exist. So we didn't even talk about basketball and I'd love to explore basketball

17:44.800 --> 17:48.800
real quick because I'm loving the idea of him wearing a fucking tank top. Like shirts and skins,

17:48.800 --> 17:52.960
let's go. I'm wearing a tank top. I'm wearing some like comfortable shorts. Let's get on,

17:52.960 --> 17:58.240
let's settle this on the court. Sometimes I'm so sad that I don't have like millions of dollars

17:58.240 --> 18:04.320
and access to like constant access to a production team because all I want now is just like exactly

18:04.320 --> 18:12.080
totally now modern like Lakers basketball game except instead of Jack it's William Shakespeare

18:12.080 --> 18:16.320
sitting courtside like throwing his hands up in the air and yelling at the rafts and like fucking

18:16.320 --> 18:22.080
throwing stuff onto the court and being ejected. God that's, I just am picturing it's the fucking

18:22.080 --> 18:29.120
funniest shit. Oh I'm a nerd. I bet he, did he have game do you think? Shakespeare? Yeah like

18:29.120 --> 18:32.160
if he played basketball do you think he could like, do you think he would perform well? Like

18:32.160 --> 18:36.800
do you think he's sort of a dog? Like do you think he's sort of a dunks man or like a three points?

18:36.800 --> 18:45.200
He would be great at like athletically I'm sure he was like off the charts right? Yet physically

18:45.200 --> 18:50.720
the man was like hustling. History is unclear on the nature of Shakespeare's trident. It may have

18:50.720 --> 18:55.920
been seven or eight people. Um there's a lot of different theories but anyway uh he was performing

18:55.920 --> 19:01.920
a lot. If you're seven or eight people he's his own basketball team. He was his, hi we're William

19:01.920 --> 19:09.520
Shakespeare and they all run out. Tonight the Harlem Globetrotters square off against the

19:09.520 --> 19:14.400
William Shakespeare. That would be a bloodbath are you kidding me? It would be a bloodbath if I

19:14.400 --> 19:18.960
got in the court with William Shakespeare because back in the what the 1500s like all the people

19:18.960 --> 19:23.440
were just a lot like their bones were much much smaller than our bones but also like everybody

19:23.440 --> 19:29.040
also had the flu a little bit always kind of and so like I think I could, I think I could like,

19:29.040 --> 19:32.720
I think I could really fucking break William Shakespeare's ankles out there.

19:34.240 --> 19:42.480
Not literally, not literally but maybe literally accidentally like I would I would do like a roll

19:42.480 --> 19:46.400
on him that would like be super super sick and everybody would cheer and in that sense I would

19:46.400 --> 19:51.120
break his ankles but I think he may if he overcorrects too much his old 1500s sickly

19:51.120 --> 19:58.320
bones might just be like done done. I've done it to the bard, the good one, the good bard.

19:58.320 --> 20:05.760
That's how I beat bard. That's how I beat shake. Okay all right I'll allow it.

20:07.760 --> 20:14.080
Um so my roommate left town to go see her family for Easter weekend and left me in charge of her

20:14.080 --> 20:19.200
plant. She prides herself on gardening skills but I seriously doubt she's ever taken care of

20:19.200 --> 20:27.440
an indoor plant before. Boom. I watched her yeah this is melt mode. Since I watched her over water

20:27.440 --> 20:34.000
it twice in the two days just before going home and now it's starting to die. I told her to stop

20:34.000 --> 20:39.440
watering it but she wouldn't listen because quote I have a cactus and I don't know how to take care

20:39.440 --> 20:46.640
of real plants. Wow Jesus you okay hold on let's stop you already put them on melt mode you don't

20:46.640 --> 20:54.320
need to keep going now. No I think this is a quote from her friend. No I think this is I think this

20:54.320 --> 20:58.480
is like I have a cactus and don't know how to take care of real plants. I think you're trying to over

20:58.480 --> 21:05.040
melt mode this one and I know. Listen question asker their roommate won't listen to question

21:05.040 --> 21:11.760
asker because question asker says they have a cactus and don't know how to take care of real

21:11.760 --> 21:14.960
plants. But they said that's in quotes and I don't think this person actually said I have a cactus

21:14.960 --> 21:20.240
and don't know how to take care of real plants. I think this is about major melt mode. Roommate okay

21:20.240 --> 21:27.040
when question asker said when QA said to roommate you're over watering it roommate said you have a

21:27.040 --> 21:35.520
cactus and don't know how to take care of real plants. Okay okay now I'm stuck caring for this

21:35.520 --> 21:41.200
stupid dying plant and she's gonna think I'm the one who killed it. She comes back on Wednesday

21:41.200 --> 21:45.760
how do I tell her she was the one who killed the plant without destroying her weirdly inflated and

21:45.760 --> 21:49.920
fragile ego. Please keep name anonymous I've been trying to get her to listen to the show and I don't

21:49.920 --> 21:53.280
want her to recognize the situation. Yeah you don't fucking think she'll pick up on this one.

21:54.800 --> 21:57.600
Listen we have a decent size following at this point but I don't think there's

21:58.320 --> 22:03.440
two pairs of roommates who have this exact situation. Yeah as this was happening she was like

22:03.440 --> 22:08.640
her eyes started to wander over to that dead ass brown plant she left in the corner like wait a

22:08.640 --> 22:15.200
minute Valerie. Do you think do you think that this is like a throw mama from the train situation

22:15.200 --> 22:20.000
where like throw plant out the apartment window. Hold on hold on wait hold on wait time out I have

22:20.000 --> 22:24.240
to call Marc Maron and say that someone on a podcast finally referenced throw mama from the

22:24.240 --> 22:29.760
train. We did it podcasters we did it. I also I know that there's also a uh we did every movie

22:29.760 --> 22:35.440
everybody that's every movie. There's a Hitchcock one too that I can't remember but uh that the

22:35.440 --> 22:39.680
roommate knew exactly what she was doing over watering the plant and then leaving you to take

22:39.680 --> 22:43.920
care of it because she felt burdened by taking care of this plant and no one longer wanted to

22:43.920 --> 22:49.440
have to care for it but she didn't want to be blamed for it. I think there's a way to save the

22:49.440 --> 22:56.400
plant. I'm not much I'm not much of an arboreal fundraiser. No I mean you got to get some of that

22:56.400 --> 23:02.640
water out of it huh if you over watered it. I think your two options are like snake venom you

23:02.640 --> 23:07.280
try to suck the water out of the plant. I don't know what that looks like maybe you uproot it

23:07.280 --> 23:12.560
real quick and you get you get down on those roots and you just like go to fucking town.

23:12.560 --> 23:17.600
Other options you got to dry it out put it in the microwave for maybe like I'm talking about

23:17.600 --> 23:24.080
four seconds at a time just like beep one two three four check it like a well what the fuck

23:24.080 --> 23:29.040
are you doing a pop tart you microwave for like 10 seconds at a time or you toast it in the pop

23:29.040 --> 23:34.160
tart machine. Who has the time Griffin? That's how you get to 30 and you haven't accomplished anything with your

23:34.160 --> 23:42.960
wife. Pivot pivot pivot Travis I just I I just put jokes outside in its special chair.

23:45.120 --> 23:51.520
Okay jokes is outside jokes can't hear you in here the serious room okay. Have you

23:52.560 --> 24:02.640
now are you now or have you ever microwaved a pop tart? Of course not of course not I just know that

24:02.640 --> 24:08.000
on the package that is an option they present. Okay oh what a relief I'm gonna let jokes back

24:08.000 --> 24:14.480
into the room. Come back in jokes. Listen all joking aside no listen listen. Why am I joking around?

24:16.000 --> 24:21.120
Jokes has feelings. Jokes come back in but just stay quiet for one second. It's fine

24:21.120 --> 24:25.840
jokes come on in. It's fine jokes he said it's fine. Now there's a fucking weird atmosphere because

24:25.840 --> 24:30.480
jokes is like thought we were talking about jokes behind its back. No that's not jokes jokes jokes

24:30.480 --> 24:40.080
that's not it. Hey bro grabs. Get bro grabs with jokes. Oh that's soft. That's my favorite after

24:40.080 --> 24:50.000
school movie. I don't think I don't think I don't think you this situation is upsetting me in such a

24:50.000 --> 24:54.560
deep deep way and I don't know why. I think I think I get upset whenever anybody thinks they're hot

24:54.560 --> 24:58.000
shit at anything that they're not hot shit at and then they like make other people try to feel bad

24:58.000 --> 25:01.920
because they're hot shit which is what it sounds like your roommate has tried to do but like

25:03.040 --> 25:08.480
I also feel bad for this sweet plant. It didn't ask for this. It didn't want this. There's nothing

25:08.480 --> 25:12.800
to be done. I mean there's nothing to be done. I mean just try to remind her it's just a plant

25:12.800 --> 25:18.320
and she can just get more. You can go get more. Go get another plant. Yeah go get a better plant.

25:18.320 --> 25:23.920
I'm kind of both like what the thing that I'm taken aback by from this question is I didn't

25:23.920 --> 25:29.520
realize the plant could die in the span of two days. I thought it'd take way longer. No they're

25:29.520 --> 25:34.160
like super fragile. I imagine if you work at like uh there's a florist around the corner from my

25:34.160 --> 25:38.960
house I imagine they're just constantly fucking screaming running around their like office all

25:38.960 --> 25:45.360
day just like oh my god now this one oh this one now oh shit this oh fuck me fuck. Could you not

25:45.360 --> 25:50.480
just go buy an identical plant? It's not like your roommate's gonna get home and be like this

25:50.480 --> 25:54.800
plant's acting completely differently. Yeah. This plant has a completely different personality than

25:54.800 --> 26:02.960
when I left. Unless. I taught this plant how to sit. Unless. Unless. Unless. It's a it's a like a

26:02.960 --> 26:09.200
like a venus fly trap that does have a little bit of personality. If it's a tulip it's a big tulip

26:09.760 --> 26:16.240
and you watered it wrong and it dies fuck it. Go buy or don't buy just get a tulip. Nature has them

26:16.240 --> 26:23.520
ready for you to go. If it's like a venus fly trap though oh that one is gonna be a little you know

26:23.520 --> 26:28.000
what I mean like if I had a venus fly trap and then you replace my venus fly trap and I saw this

26:28.000 --> 26:34.000
new venus fly trap eat a fly or a mosquito or whatever and I saw it do it I'd be like that was

26:34.000 --> 26:40.240
different it moved it has character it animated a little bit differently and so where's where's Tony

26:40.240 --> 26:45.440
my original venus fly trap? The problem is then your roommate should never have watered a venus

26:45.440 --> 26:53.200
fly trap because the only liquid it needs is human blood. Yeah. I've seen little shop. Yeah the joke

26:53.200 --> 26:58.000
of the little shop. Yes thank you. I think that I don't think they get that big Trev. I think it

26:58.000 --> 27:03.680
might be different plants. What? Yeah I think it might be different plants because they don't they

27:03.680 --> 27:08.400
don't usually get that big. You don't think that the little shop plant is based on a venus fly

27:08.400 --> 27:12.880
trap? You don't like think conceptually that that there's a one-in-one connection there? I think it's

27:12.880 --> 27:20.240
based on the um what's a little plumber on the Mario plants. The Mario ones. The Mario ones the

27:20.240 --> 27:24.880
plants that come out of the pipes. Chompums. They look chompers they look exactly like that.

27:26.000 --> 27:33.760
Um it was actually based on a true story of a plant that one time bit off Rick Moranis's pinky

27:33.760 --> 27:40.000
finger and he said I've got a great idea for a movie. Well he didn't his friend who was there

27:40.000 --> 27:46.080
with him was like ah shit Rick we need to go to a hospital. Hey do y'all want to yahoo? Yes.

27:46.880 --> 27:50.960
Yes. Just thinking this one's great because just thinking about biting off Rick Moranis's pinky

27:50.960 --> 27:57.040
finger has me all hungry. Uh sent by Nicholas Potter is from yahoo answers user Sharon S who

27:57.040 --> 28:07.440

that go well with shrimp scampi. I will start because I invented the exercise and I will begin

29:01.520 --> 29:09.280
with revenge. Oh interesting I was gonna say regret. Mmm. No the Travis's. Justin's is right

29:09.280 --> 29:13.600
yes. Okay. Travis's is wrong. You can't you can't be regretful when you're chomping into some of

29:13.600 --> 29:18.560

29:55.040 --> 29:59.760
can't use the information that comes after this but there's this week somebody's gonna have

29:59.760 --> 30:07.280
fucking shrimp scampi. Okay Griffin your turn. Well no I was talking over yours and I know you

30:07.280 --> 30:11.120
said homemade ball pit and now I'm thinking about getting a ball pit and eating this good buttery

30:11.120 --> 30:17.840
shrimp with my friends and wife. Right? I think it would be a messy ball like I don't want other

30:17.840 --> 30:27.120
things getting in the ball pit but at the same time I think it'd be like a fun time. Um oh I have

30:27.120 --> 30:32.800
one. Go ahead Trav. I hate to jump I hate to jump back to me. Yeah you're doing double dutch aren't

30:32.800 --> 30:38.720
you? But what what goes well with shrimp scampi? Staring wistfully into your tank full of salt

30:38.720 --> 30:44.160
water exotic fish while you eat it. Oh just think it like I love these fish so much I wish I could

30:44.160 --> 30:48.400
eat them but I can't so I'm gonna eat things like them while looking at them and could be like it

30:48.400 --> 30:58.240
could be you David. Yeah. How about how about a hot bath? Shrimp scampi in the bath please. Yeah I

30:58.240 --> 31:02.640
don't mind if I do. I might treat myself to that tonight in in real life just get in the bath with

31:02.640 --> 31:10.160
a full-bodied wine and a hame flick and chomp down on these good little buttery boys. What? I just

31:10.160 --> 31:14.640
I just love shrimp scampi and I thought we'd all get like really excited about this question but

31:14.640 --> 31:21.040
I sense your guys hesitance to even like play with me right now. I love Alice I love shrimp scampi

31:21.040 --> 31:26.320
there's no there's no argument about that it's one of my fav foods. Prove it motherfucker. Whoa

31:27.200 --> 31:32.880
it's hard because uh it's hard because my cousin Mike loves shrimp scampi so much that we call him

31:32.880 --> 31:40.720
scampi Mike so I feel like it's weird for me to try I feel like a pretender to the like in the

31:40.720 --> 31:45.840
back of my head all I can think is like well I don't like it as much as Michael does and they're

31:45.840 --> 31:51.520
gonna know. Sounds like nobody does. Can I posit a shrimp scampi? Yeah well let's pause that for a

31:51.520 --> 31:59.200
second. Question? Yeah please. So shrimp scampi implies it is shrimp that has been scampied

31:59.200 --> 32:06.880
correct this is shrimp scampi. Yeah. Is there chicken scampi or steak scampi or fish scampi

32:06.880 --> 32:13.520
or pork scampi? Shit pork scampi's good this is oh shit this is gonna be like beef nugs too

32:14.080 --> 32:17.760
we're like where's all the fucking beef scampi where's the chicken scampi at? I'm just saying

32:17.760 --> 32:25.680
scampi as like as the suffix it implies that like we took shrimp and we scampied it so now

32:25.680 --> 32:32.080
it's shrimp scampi. Yeah dude. Right? God I want to eat some motherfucking shrimp scampi tonight

32:32.080 --> 32:37.760
this is not a joke I'm gonna go grease up those scampi dish like right now and get crazy on them

32:37.760 --> 32:43.040
tonight. I love shrimp scampi I love it because when the chef who first invented shrimp scampi

32:43.040 --> 32:47.680
invented it they were like this dish is so good it needs the most fun name ever scampi.

32:47.680 --> 32:55.360
Um I like chicken scampi is good it's like chicken scampi. It's not is it real?

32:56.480 --> 33:02.880
Chicken scampi is real at the Olive Garden. Oh well then Travis's point was is moot. I mean

33:02.880 --> 33:07.760
I've had chicken scampi at the Olive Garden it's very good. Well shit Olive Garden chomped our

33:07.760 --> 33:11.040
flavor or literally chomped our flavor by Travis. Travis has to leave the podcast for the rest of

33:11.040 --> 33:16.240
the show yeah. Get out of here jokes. That was Travis's retirement was gonna be chicken scampi

33:16.240 --> 33:26.480
inventing it. Um you should um shit we've shit okay hold on Travis. Travis it's all right dude

33:26.480 --> 33:32.560

33:32.560 --> 33:45.680
Travis you're gonna find another one man it's fine.

33:45.680 --> 33:51.360
I won't. Never again. This was the one.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.280
I want a munch. Squad.

34:03.760 --> 34:06.320
I want too much. Squad.

34:08.320 --> 34:13.200
I'm a fucking amazing actor I made myself cry doing that. That's so powerful Travis.

34:13.200 --> 34:19.360
It's fucking it's inside out outside in Sam Scorsese shit thank you. Travis. Yes Justin.

34:19.920 --> 34:28.000
Good news. Do you know how you've been having trouble finding french fries? Uh-huh. Well

34:29.600 --> 34:32.880
the search is over because Taco Bell's got them now. Oh my god.

34:34.320 --> 34:39.520
That's right and they're not just any. You mad geniuses. And they're not just any fries

34:39.520 --> 34:46.960
this time they're nacho fries. What? Um but they can be yo's I mean they're nachos. Thank you.

34:46.960 --> 34:54.560
You get it? Yeah. Um can I do this segment while lying on the floor? No it's that they don't have

34:54.560 --> 35:02.400
now here's the weird thing about nacho fries. Uh I mean there's many weird things about nacho fries

35:02.400 --> 35:08.240
they're seasoned with nacho seasonings right? Are we talking about sorry we need to be like salt?

35:08.240 --> 35:13.680
Are we talking about Mexican seasonings? Are we talking about long potato straws that have been

35:13.680 --> 35:19.520
fried up or is this some fucked up like it's just like strips of tortillas that we're calling fries?

35:20.080 --> 35:23.280
Because I don't fuck with that like I don't fuck with Andy Capp and his whole business.

35:23.840 --> 35:31.120
No they are french fries like they're french fries. Now these were a big thing in Canada.

35:31.120 --> 35:37.200
Canada has like fries. Canada Taco Bell has been kicking it with french fries for a long time.

35:37.200 --> 35:42.400
Um they are off that grind. I mean they're probably still on that grind but now they're

35:42.400 --> 35:48.800
letting that grind come down here. Um but it it is new for this year. Now here's the unusual thing

35:49.520 --> 35:56.160
normally I don't uh I I don't do Munch Squad unless I can have a press release to refer to.

35:56.800 --> 36:04.000
Um I have I have scoured the internet and cannot find any evidence of Taco Bell as a corporation

36:04.000 --> 36:11.280
admitting that they're selling fries. Really? They have signs up so if you go to the location

36:11.280 --> 36:17.280
right they are definitely selling fries and there's like commercials and stuff but as an

36:17.280 --> 36:23.600
organization they're they have like plausible deniability. It's like a home brew like serve

36:23.600 --> 36:30.000
fries if you want Taco Bell individual restaurants if we can call you that but we're not gonna we're

36:30.000 --> 36:37.440
not gonna shine any light on it. It's like that like you guys fry right radio that's not that

36:37.440 --> 36:42.960
anything it's not it's not no Travis that's not anything what you've said it's like pirate radio

36:42.960 --> 36:49.280
but it's fries there's a lot of people covering this phenomenon um Anderson Cooper getting up

36:49.280 --> 36:54.960
in there yeah a lot of people are getting pretty excited about it the headline on um Hello Giggles

36:54.960 --> 37:01.360
is Nacho Bell Taco Bell nacho fries are here and they look absolutely delicious. Now I don't know

37:01.360 --> 37:09.120
what photo of these fries they are referring to but if you can imagine I mean it's basically just

37:10.080 --> 37:16.880
french like a big mess of french fries and nacho cheese and sour cream and diced tomatoes and chives

37:17.600 --> 37:21.920
on top of the french fries and what appears to be ground beef. This looks horrifying.

37:21.920 --> 37:31.200
It's not great it's not great um and I don't know what I know Taco Bell refuses to look at it uh

37:31.200 --> 37:36.240
Taco Bell refuses to talk about it Taco Bell is staying silent. So there's no PR there's no PR

37:36.240 --> 37:42.080
quotes for this much squad. I feel like if you called Taco Bell about this they would say like

37:42.080 --> 37:47.440
wait a minute where did you see that what location and then they would call that specific Taco Bell

37:47.440 --> 37:54.080
and say hey listen I got a very a very important phone call that you're doing something very bad

37:54.640 --> 38:03.200
down there it's hot in uh in uh in Huntington West Virginia you were selling fries at Taco Bell

38:03.200 --> 38:09.280
and they said well yeah you emailed everybody in the company and said I did no such thing

38:09.280 --> 38:20.400
or my name's not Mr. Bell. I tried calling the Taco Bell corporate office but it is Saturday

38:20.400 --> 38:26.320
morning. Can you call Griffin as long as we're on this tip can you call a Taco Bell in your area

38:26.320 --> 38:32.080
you know in Austin and see if they have the nacho fries. Yes but I won't call the one that I've gone

38:32.080 --> 38:38.160
to before and maybe will someday again. Yeah don't do that just call one and see if you can get any

38:38.160 --> 38:53.920
details on it. Hi do you all have those nacho fries? Nacho fries? Yeah um what is it no oh

38:53.920 --> 39:00.240
there's a there's the chips to make some nachos but oh but not fries no that makes sense all right

39:00.240 --> 39:08.720
thank you. You're welcome. Booyah so how fucking deep does this go how deep does this con go did

39:08.720 --> 39:15.840
you hear the hesitance like okay if I were to Taco Bell and someone asked me if I had french fries

39:15.840 --> 39:22.160
the answer would be at the tip of my tongue yeah absolutely not are you kidding me you called Taco

39:22.160 --> 39:28.720
Bell like unless unless the person I just spoke to on the phone is they're like they're like stealth

39:28.720 --> 39:33.680
shit is so locked down that they like I could probably go into that store and get some nacho

39:33.680 --> 39:37.760
fries and they're like okay now that you're here yeah here have some nacho fries but like you could

39:37.760 --> 39:42.000
have they she probably knew that I was recording the conversation and she couldn't give out that

39:42.000 --> 39:46.400
kind of evidence on that that would be like corporate confirmation that was a that was a

39:46.400 --> 39:54.080
that was a like skilled agent. Normally we tell you a lot to tweet at folks but I would like

39:54.080 --> 39:59.360
everybody to tweet at Taco Bell and just ask why they're covering up the nacho fries. Be nice about

39:59.360 --> 40:05.200
it. Be nice about it oh speaking of which Griffin I don't know if you saw this but uh Taco Bell

40:05.200 --> 40:12.240
adjacent congratulations to our friend Dan Riker for winning a wedding at Taco Bell uh that's gonna

40:12.240 --> 40:16.160
be a hoot and a half. It's gonna be a real hootenanny. Make sure you get us an invite.

40:16.160 --> 40:22.960
I think it's time to head to the zone of money did I do that right? Almost not. Can I read can

40:22.960 --> 40:27.760
I read one thing really quick and it's gonna be a little time warp but it's I want to read the

40:27.760 --> 40:32.880
best answer on this shrimp scampi question about what goes well with shrimp scampi because user

40:32.880 --> 40:41.680
red pandas really knocked out of the park when they said shrimp scampi. Some more some more of it.

40:41.680 --> 40:56.800
Nice. All right let's go to the next one. This week my brother my brother and me is sponsored by

40:56.800 --> 41:01.920
Casper. It's an online retailer of premium obsessively engineered mattresses for a fraction

41:01.920 --> 41:07.280
of the price and I can speak to this not just as someone that they're paying to speak to it

41:07.280 --> 41:14.320
but also a customer who is incredibly pleased. We have both a Casper mattress that my wife and I

41:14.320 --> 41:19.440
sleep on every single night and also a Casper mattress in our guest room that our friends

41:19.440 --> 41:25.120
have come over and slept on and always compliment. I this is okay listen I have a really hard time

41:25.120 --> 41:30.560
sounding sincere as evidenced by this commercial but when my wife and I switch from our old mattress

41:30.560 --> 41:38.000
to our Casper mattress no joke noticeable difference in sleep quality like we slept so much better

41:38.000 --> 41:44.320
woke up like more refreshed I mean not now we have a five month old baby but back when we were like

41:44.320 --> 41:51.680
full human beings we slept so good. Yeah we have that sleep we have one too and it's it's it's

41:51.680 --> 41:56.800
really good it's in our guest room and so I really only sleep on it when I have like diarrhea or

41:56.800 --> 42:01.440
something like that and don't want to wake up everybody else um with my like run like every

42:01.440 --> 42:08.880
other night it's not funny kind of funny it's not funny I thought it was kind of funny it's

42:08.880 --> 42:13.280
not funny to have that to have that happen to you anyway Casper mattresses are really comfortable

42:13.280 --> 42:16.640
I'm sorry that I they probably don't want us talking about diarrhea during these advertisements

42:16.640 --> 42:22.640
but like when when life hands you lemons uh did you also know that my bim bam listers can get

42:22.640 --> 42:26.800

bullet points here make sure we hit everything uh the risk return policy made in America diarrhea

42:54.960 --> 43:03.920
yeah all right we're good um tell me now are you ready give it all of it baby I want to talk about

43:03.920 --> 43:12.080
movement or as uh they prefer it to pronounce movement uh it's movement without an n or vowels

43:12.080 --> 43:17.680
I don't know it's mvmt and it actually says to pronounce it movement um so just this once I'll

43:17.680 --> 43:23.040
let it slide uh it was founded on the belief that style shouldn't break the bank they're cool watches

43:23.760 --> 43:29.680
they make a watch and you put it on and you know what time it is you look great you know it's a it's

43:29.680 --> 43:41.280
a uh important to keep track of it because if not you'll be late or early oh shoot you're early

43:41.280 --> 43:47.600
early you need a wrist friend to help you out because you're too fucking early for the party

43:47.600 --> 43:56.160
shoot very or very early I'm very early I'm very early this party fuck fuck I need a wrist friend

43:56.160 --> 44:01.440
for movement there are serious problems with that I had a conference call this week scheduled for

44:01.440 --> 44:08.560
a certain time and I showed up a half hour before it was to begin but the person who was on it with

44:08.560 --> 44:13.840
me uh who's on the conference call uh the person running it gets a text notification someone lines

44:13.840 --> 44:22.560
up to their uh gets onto their line so they hopped on two uh before everybody else and by the time

44:22.560 --> 44:29.280
we could make get through like the apologies and I'm sorry and I I didn't understand and uh

44:29.280 --> 44:35.440
etc etc there was it was just close enough to the meeting that it would have been weird to hang up

44:35.440 --> 44:42.080
and call back later you apologize for 30 minutes just kind of like hung hung on the call no it

44:42.080 --> 44:47.280
just would have been like weird so I ended up just like making conversation turn it into a nice

44:48.320 --> 44:52.720
chat sounds like a good day good work socializing you did well like that could have been a what if

44:52.720 --> 44:58.240
they had been a bad person yeah yeah you both need those good wrist friends for movement

44:58.240 --> 45:02.240
um these movement watches started just 95 bucks at a department store you're looking at like 400

45:02.240 --> 45:08.000
to 500 bucks for a nice watch um I have one I think we all have one and they're really nice

45:08.000 --> 45:14.960
they're um they're they're really slick and um I didn't think I would like the the face of the

45:14.960 --> 45:20.320
watches a little bit bigger than watches I've worn in the past but like I I actually really like it

45:20.320 --> 45:24.400

D&D and for that we are forever grateful love from the nerdiest polycule to ever adventure

47:05.280 --> 47:10.640
uh this is I I'm glad that they clarified they're talking about a D&D thing here and not that why is

47:10.640 --> 47:19.200
is what Alex making such explicit fights yeah is that yeah like the orc stands up and gets out the

47:19.200 --> 47:28.000
axe and also a peepee um I don't know if that means graphically violent or like beautifully

47:28.000 --> 47:32.160
described in a graphic manner that allows me to really picture it in my mind's eye or

47:32.160 --> 47:41.280
or I can't make heads or tails to any of this nerd shit honestly dunked on them dunked on all

47:41.280 --> 47:48.480
four thanks for the money uh we do a Dungeons and Dragons podcast are you sad and confused

47:48.480 --> 47:52.960
about world politics worried about the upcoming inevitable nuclear war or maybe a rat is living

47:52.960 --> 47:57.040
in your house there's a rat living in my house how do you get rid of a rat from a house why not

47:57.040 --> 48:01.200
immerse yourself in a completely fictional imagined podcast for the beef and dairy industries

48:01.200 --> 48:06.240
it works for me the beef and dairy network podcast is the number one podcast for those involved

48:06.240 --> 48:10.880
or just interested in the production of beef animals and dairy herds don't worry it's funnier

48:10.880 --> 48:15.920
than it sounds find us at beefanddairynetwork.com or maximumfund.org or wherever you get your

48:15.920 --> 48:24.400
podcast from oh god there's the rat oh god the other day I went to mcdonald's to claim my free

48:24.400 --> 48:33.600
coffee since I've completed I have a completed coffee fidelity card when I when I go to mcdonald's

48:33.600 --> 48:37.920
it is always at the same time at the drive through so it's always the same girl at the till

48:38.480 --> 48:44.080
however when I came to give her my free coffee coupon she said I could keep the coupon and she

48:44.080 --> 48:51.440
still gave me the free coffee fuck yeah oh this is a good one can I use my coupon given that the girl

48:51.440 --> 48:58.880
knows I've already tried to claim it do I have to go to an out-of-town mcdonald's to claim it

48:59.440 --> 49:05.520
or have I entered an infinite free coffee loophole that's from the most caffeinated munch squad

49:05.520 --> 49:12.800
member in Montreal where apparently they have mcdonald's do not drive any amount of distance

49:12.800 --> 49:21.600
above normal to get a free like 99 cent coffee it it will not it doesn't it doesn't work out

49:21.600 --> 49:28.560
it does not financially speaking as your financial advisor yeah don't do this the amount that you

49:28.560 --> 49:33.920
would spend on gas or as you say in Montreal petrol it doesn't it's not that you may as well

49:33.920 --> 49:40.240
drink the petrol at that point um it's just not it's not it's not cost effective I do really like

49:40.240 --> 49:46.640
this question though because it sounds like you've discovered like a way to tie a string around your

49:46.640 --> 49:51.680
coffee your completed coffee fidelity card and then when you hand it in and they're like about

49:51.680 --> 49:56.080
to like put it in the register you yank the string and it's back out in your hand and you still get

49:56.080 --> 50:00.720
that coffee and nobody's the wiser here's what you're gonna have you're gonna have to do this

50:01.440 --> 50:06.720
you're gonna have to collect a bunch of empty coffee like mcdonald's coffee cups pile them in

50:06.720 --> 50:12.800
pile them in the seat next to you and then like two days later pull out the coupon again at which

50:12.800 --> 50:18.080
point they'll have no choice but to believe you or else where did you get all those empty cups

50:23.520 --> 50:32.400
such an elaborate con elaborate ruse um my first thought when I thought this was uh um well

50:32.400 --> 50:38.160
uh you know that's a very nice thing that she did for you that's very kind but the more I think

50:38.160 --> 50:45.600
about it you have to drink mcdonald's coffee every day it's really the way cafe is fine can we not

50:45.600 --> 50:51.440
with our live in a country with tim hortons everywhere every 10 feet there's a tim in your

50:51.440 --> 50:56.800
car there's a tim hortons there's a tim hortons open your dashboard open your glove compartment

50:56.800 --> 51:01.200
there's a little tim hortons in there are you just going to mcdonald's and getting

51:01.200 --> 51:07.360
a coffee through the drive-thru i mean what i'm that's where i'm struggling with it they're

51:07.360 --> 51:11.360
probably getting i mean something else also right they're probably getting they're probably

51:11.360 --> 51:18.000
getting a mcgriddle or big big griffin thank you because my point here is if you get a food item

51:18.000 --> 51:21.760
the coffee's just a value at the coffee's how they get you in the door and then you're buying

51:21.760 --> 51:26.720
a hash brown and a mcgriddle and a cheese them and that's where you're making they're making

51:26.720 --> 51:32.240
their money right like there the money is to be made it's on the food items the coffee that's a

51:32.240 --> 51:37.520
value add that just gets you in the door so like you keeping that coffee fidelity card guarantees

51:37.520 --> 51:42.880
you coming back to mcdonald's one more time literally so this is win-win for everybody i

51:42.880 --> 51:46.960
would say in this scenario make a point that the opposite of what my brother just said is true

51:46.960 --> 51:53.280
fast food chains make their money on the drinks and travis is a liar maybe here in the us of a

51:53.280 --> 51:59.360
the us of a in canada we do things a little different i'm travis for canada

52:01.280 --> 52:05.360
um i man did y'all ever grown up

52:08.160 --> 52:13.920
i haven't said the funny thing yet dog y'all grown up ever wish you had a fast food friend

52:14.960 --> 52:20.160
i would because it sounds like you've got a genuine fast food friend on your hands and when i

52:20.160 --> 52:25.440
lived in the west virginia building i ate pretty much every dinner at the wendy's and i just thought

52:25.440 --> 52:30.240
it would be so sick if i could just drive up and my wendy's friend was there i was just like

52:31.040 --> 52:35.840
don't worry about it man and i would get my chicken my spicy chicken sandwich and it would

52:35.840 --> 52:41.840
not be a big deal don't worry about it man griffin it's me your fast food friend go get out of here

52:41.840 --> 52:46.320
come on your money's no good here i'm your fast food friend griffin i love this sitcom you're

52:46.320 --> 52:50.480
building when fast food friend gets fired for giving away free chicken sandwiches they wouldn't

52:50.480 --> 52:56.320
know come live with you no no they wouldn't they wouldn't they they they deal out so many chicken

52:56.320 --> 53:00.880
sandwiches there they deal with so many spicy boys that in in this wendy's nobody's gonna notice that

53:00.880 --> 53:06.080
my friend hooked me up with one like no there's a zero percent chance of that also i think everybody

53:06.080 --> 53:10.560
at working at that wendy's everybody working at any fast food place knows like you can have five

53:11.760 --> 53:15.040
what would they drive through buddies that you can hook up and it's not a big deal

53:15.040 --> 53:19.760
there's that's like that's written into the wendy's budget like dave thomas came up with that and was

53:19.760 --> 53:24.080
like just you got five drive-through buddies don't worry about just slide them some chicken sandwiches

53:24.080 --> 53:29.920
and it's not a big deal it's on me dave and he smiles real big what if you overlap with a different

53:29.920 --> 53:35.920
fast food buddy like they they walk over and see another drive-through worker slipping you a free

53:35.920 --> 53:42.080
spicy chicken friend and they're like whoa whoa what's this i thought i was your drive-through

53:42.080 --> 53:48.160
buddy i thought you're double dipping what the fuck griffin i would never do that i would never

53:48.160 --> 53:53.040
cheat on my my my fast food friend there's no way i would do that because i'm not greedy i just want

53:53.040 --> 53:58.080
free spicy chicken sandwiches at my wendy's that i go to and it's not even it's not even about the

53:58.080 --> 54:03.600
money it's just like oh nice thanks you know it's like i'm ah cool it's like having a cool like

54:03.600 --> 54:09.440
confidant i just had an amazing realization that at some point in in human history and probably

54:09.440 --> 54:14.800
at some point every day someone has followed up to a fast food drive-through and said like

54:14.800 --> 54:21.840
hey yo can i speak to dillip please can you uh can you put put my man dillip on on the line please

54:21.840 --> 54:27.920
and that that probably happens right you probably dillip dillip's not here oh okay never mind bye

54:28.560 --> 54:36.720
do you guys when you get your fast food you're at the bill miller's barbecue and you've just

54:36.720 --> 54:43.040
ordered your pulled pork sandwich and you're ready to pull through and go up and this is literally

54:43.040 --> 54:46.960
every time i go and i don't eat that much fast food but it's literally every time it happens i

54:46.960 --> 54:53.840
have this thought i'm starting to leave the sign that tell the big glowing sign that's like here's

54:53.840 --> 54:59.440
here's what kind of days you can have do you want to have a pulled pork day or a po boy day or it's

54:59.440 --> 55:05.920
up to you i always have this moment as i'm pulling away from the sign towards the window of i hope

55:05.920 --> 55:12.880
nobody passes me i hope nobody drives around me and takes my spot in line and gets my food and

55:12.880 --> 55:18.400
then i get the person behind me's food how do they keep track of how do they keep track of it but

55:18.400 --> 55:23.280
also i just worry about because sometimes if somebody like i guess changes their mind in the

55:23.280 --> 55:27.600
bill miller's line which is like unthinkable to me where they just like fuck this i'm out of here

55:27.600 --> 55:31.520
and so they drive and they pass you on the right as they go to leave i have this every time i see

55:31.520 --> 55:35.920
somebody passing me on the right in the drive through i think like food pirates get them they're

55:35.920 --> 55:41.600
just gonna take my food i a hundred a hundred percent of the time i think it's a food pirate

55:41.600 --> 55:47.120
situation i have before been in the drive through ordered my food and then as i was pulling up

55:47.120 --> 55:52.400
realized i don't have my wallet they just dipped and you've just fucked up the whole queue as we

55:52.400 --> 55:57.120
say up here in canada just like really goofed up the whole thing we're supposed to go in and wash

55:57.120 --> 56:02.640
dishes yeah like peewee's big adventure do you think what that happens the next person pulls up

56:02.640 --> 56:05.680
and they're like this isn't your order right and they're like no like would you like to pay for

56:05.680 --> 56:10.160
this one too would you like both orders because now we got this extra one and if you don't buy it

56:10.160 --> 56:16.400
it's just gonna be sitting here all day i would love to hear a story about whether that particular

56:16.400 --> 56:20.800
act of food crime has been perpetrated of somebody just like waiting for you to place your order and

56:20.800 --> 56:27.760
then squeak fucking tokyo drifting 360 spinning gymkhana style getting that car right in front

56:27.760 --> 56:31.600
of your fucking car and you're like hey wait a second and then they get your whopper junior

56:31.600 --> 56:36.240
they like flip you off out of the window like fuck you nerd got your whopper junior and they

56:36.240 --> 56:41.440
drive off and you pull up to the window like sorry is our last whopper junior we're out so fucking

56:41.440 --> 56:47.360
sick closing down now gotta shut down ran out of beef patties justin have you ever considered when

56:47.360 --> 56:52.320
you have forgotten your wallet going back later that afternoon and be like hey sorry about that

56:52.320 --> 56:58.320
forgot my wallet do you still have it you still hold it for me travis by that afternoon like

56:58.320 --> 57:02.320
literally everyone who's ever worked there has already been fired or quit and it's under

57:02.320 --> 57:06.320
this change management twice because of what you did

57:09.520 --> 57:16.000
yeah i think this is also a good situation though i mean you gotta make the lemonade

57:16.000 --> 57:20.400
or you pull up and you're like i don't have my wallet what's your name and they're like mica

57:20.400 --> 57:26.480
you're like mica you ever wanted to be somebody's fast food friend and then maybe this is i don't i

57:26.480 --> 57:30.800
don't have mike i don't have the money but i really really want that sandwich is there any

57:30.800 --> 57:37.200

57:42.320 --> 57:47.680
i don't have money i have jokes i'm a good friend and you're a thumb drive loaded with podcasts

57:48.240 --> 57:55.280
yeah here's my here's my art let me have some of your art it's an exchange it's exchange of ideas

57:55.920 --> 58:02.560
what would happen like what would happen because if i go to them and say like listen i don't have

58:02.560 --> 58:10.160
money but that food is mine oh shit you made it for me you made it for me and like the value

58:10.160 --> 58:17.360
is depreciating as we sit here and talk about this like you're wasting time time lost is uh

58:18.400 --> 58:25.280
edibility lost and you need to give it it's my food and i can't pay for it but you're not going

58:25.280 --> 58:30.640
to do anything with it it's mine and i promise customer loyalty that's what i can offer you

58:30.640 --> 58:36.320
i'll be back i'll be back you know look at my face i'm not lying to you i'll be back here

58:36.320 --> 58:42.160
i'll do an upcharge if that's what it takes all these empty cups in my seat you can trust me this

58:42.160 --> 58:46.000
isn't and again this has nothing to do with money and i don't want to exploit like fucking hard

58:46.000 --> 58:51.440
working fast food workers that's not what this is i it's it's just i just want a fast food friend

58:51.440 --> 58:59.040
like that's it that's it i just want to be buddies with fucking saracen at the alamo freeze and just

58:59.040 --> 59:04.400
like get some free frosties from time to time that's it that's it you are right now as we speak

59:04.400 --> 59:11.440
getting hundreds of tweets about like come come to the jerry queen in milwaukee i'll give you

59:11.440 --> 59:17.680
all the tenders you want i might i might do it i might do it it's not and it has nothing to do

59:17.680 --> 59:21.360
with the money i just want to know what that feels like to have a fast food friend like saracen at

59:21.360 --> 59:29.280
the alamo freeze that doesn't happen to me here in honeyton i made a television program here i

59:29.280 --> 59:36.960
don't give free anything it's ludicrous nobody gives a shit about me nobody in the food industry

59:36.960 --> 59:42.000
i wish i had one place one special place just one friend one place i can go where i know i

59:42.000 --> 59:48.320

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:15.680
the scampi depot and you just pull in scam people scampi planet listen this is stupid listen it's

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:20.800
the end of the podcast and that can only mean one thing shrimp gun and it's a gun they fucking fight

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:25.440
you drive you pay five dollars there's a little slot you drop five dollars in it and then you

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:30.400
drive out to the window and they shoot you with a gun that shoots scampi out of it through your

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:35.120
fucking window and it's the fastest drive-through line ever there's no stopping if you stop you're

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:39.360
removed from the line and you don't get your scampi it's like those trains it's those trains

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:43.760
where you pull the like pull the line it just dumps water into that one container it's like

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:51.600
that but with scampi and in your sunroof i'm talking it's a fucking modified car wash that

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:56.960
you open up all your windows and you pay and if we're doing this much volume i think this is

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:02.640
fifty dollars and you fucking drive through and you just like instead of hot soapy wax it's just

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:08.320
like you end up with a bunch of shrimp in your undercarriage you end up with shrimp fucking

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:14.880
everywhere you're kidding me if you're getting a multi-directional shrimp blast what if you had a

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:21.440
fast food restaurant that was extremely long but extremely narrow so you ordered at one window and

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:27.920
then the theme of the restaurant was gun it so like after after after you order your food they're

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:34.400
like okay and punch it and after you punch it you're you cannot slow down you cannot stop or

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:40.480
you don't get your food you just have to like blaze past the pickup window with your arm outstretched

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:46.560
as fast as humanly possible like that is the it's drag racing plus fast food fastest food fucking
