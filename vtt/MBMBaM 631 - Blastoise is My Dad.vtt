00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:48.500 --> 00:50.500
It's better, it's better with you

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
It's better, it's better with you

01:00.300 --> 01:02.300
It's better, it's better with you

01:11.020 --> 01:16.980
Hello everybody and welcome my brother my brother main advice show for the modular. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

01:16.980 --> 01:22.980
I'm your miller's brother Travis the unstoppable McElroy. I'm Griffin. Whoa, they tried to get me

01:22.980 --> 01:26.740
I'm Griffin McElroy enough about you. I'm Griffin

01:27.380 --> 01:30.540
Mackle but Travis Travis is back. I'm unstoppable

01:30.980 --> 01:34.780
He's unstoppable. They can I'm down. I just want to say and

01:35.700 --> 01:40.100
listen, I mean I yeah, I had coven and it gave me a lot of time to think and

01:40.100 --> 01:45.940
And maybe some of the threads and the tapestry revealed themselves to me. Oh boy

01:45.940 --> 01:49.900
It became pretty obvious to me that this whole coven thing was a conspiracy

01:50.420 --> 01:53.580
Don't look my thing is don't look too close at the loom

01:54.220 --> 01:57.740
So we all make that or the loom looks back. Here's the thing

01:57.740 --> 02:03.220
I don't know if you guys noticed this I got coven shortly after Joe Biden was like, okay pandemics done

02:03.620 --> 02:08.420
Kind of makes it seem like maybe it was all set up to get to me waiting

02:08.420 --> 02:10.260
until

02:10.260 --> 02:14.940
The party don't stop till Travis gets kovat and walk in

02:15.380 --> 02:21.420
More like Jovid because it seems like he set this whole thing up to take me out of the game Jovid

02:21.420 --> 02:26.460
I wonder if anyone's ever said that yeah, and this close to election season

02:26.460 --> 02:32.020
Maybe trying to take this key player that out of the game some red flags and okay

02:32.020 --> 02:38.520
Clack songs for me. Well Travis. Yeah about one month before election season Jovid

02:38.780 --> 02:43.960
Finally came to the culmination of his two and a half year plan to doubt Travis out of the game

02:44.060 --> 02:48.340
And we all saw the numbers shift when Trav when Trav E got it

02:48.820 --> 02:53.740
Or rather I guess when it got Trav E when it got to me, but you know what I fucking beat it Joe

02:53.740 --> 02:59.300
Yeah, I got it Joe we beat I beat it. So Joe Rogan

02:59.300 --> 03:07.100
Oh sucks, but got a lot it sort of buzz about him when he got

03:07.540 --> 03:10.140
Kovat. Yeah, and then think of those numbers

03:10.420 --> 03:17.780
Well, he took off his clothes his clothes revealing his big beautiful body and he did like his secret like

03:18.340 --> 03:20.540
You know Alex Jones spa

03:21.020 --> 03:22.140
sesh

03:22.140 --> 03:26.620
that he did that helped him kind of like hop over it and so

03:26.620 --> 03:30.780
Obviously everything we're about to say is a goof in a bit

03:31.500 --> 03:36.900
But is there anything that you want to share about sort of your recovery period?

03:37.940 --> 03:40.260
That you could go viral for no pun intended

03:41.980 --> 03:43.380
Yeah, just for that

03:43.380 --> 03:49.580
I mean, I know Jovids over and no one else is gonna get it but I'm gonna get it if hypothetically someone did if there were

03:49.580 --> 03:55.020
Some key learnings that you had and this is a joke and a bit. Yeah, I ate a lot of cookies

03:55.020 --> 03:57.020
A good bunch of what kind? Oh

03:57.460 --> 04:00.580
Any kind I could get my hand on really a lot of the soft bake

04:01.140 --> 04:08.100
I had some German style cookies from the Aldi that really helped power me through that vitamin cookie

04:08.460 --> 04:13.100
Interesting knitting but the blanket I made is far too wide far too wide

04:13.740 --> 04:21.020
Which I'm regretting is a scarf. Well, no, it's a blanket for my child. Yeah, but it's too wide. It's a scarf

04:21.020 --> 04:25.140
It's a scar. Oh, wait. We're doing a bit right now about

04:26.460 --> 04:29.740
Travis's Joe Rogan Alex Jones spa techniques to get over kovat

04:29.740 --> 04:33.700
But I do actually want to explore Justin's bit that he's just proposed which is like

04:36.380 --> 04:39.000
Bit is like putting it to struggle. Yeah. Okay

04:39.700 --> 04:44.780
And so wait, so Justin that's all it was is that if I stop making the blanket now, yeah

04:45.300 --> 04:47.300
It's a scarf. Yeah

04:47.820 --> 04:49.820
And if you had started a while back

04:49.820 --> 04:54.140
You know, you would have had a nice little maybe a potholder. Yeah

04:54.860 --> 04:56.460
Coaster. Oh

04:56.460 --> 04:58.760
Trav, I'm sorry. You got

04:59.620 --> 05:00.380
I'm sorry

05:00.380 --> 05:04.940
You got covered but good news is you had plenty of time to watch hocus-pocus, too

05:04.940 --> 05:08.340
And I'm one more like joke is focused to it's part of it

05:09.140 --> 05:11.140
Okay, more like crocus

05:11.980 --> 05:16.740
You watch hocus-pocus to you. How many times I wanted to do a quick count just like how many yeah

05:16.740 --> 05:23.740
How many times you probably are gonna put us to shame. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah a leaderboard trap. I

05:24.620 --> 05:27.340
Watched Josie and the Pussycats for the first time. Ah

05:29.540 --> 05:35.700
And that kind of took up took up a lot of my time I watched I

05:36.860 --> 05:37.980
watched

05:37.980 --> 05:41.940
All of season 12 a taskmaster. Are you gonna tell me single digits?

05:41.940 --> 05:48.200
Well, I guess Justin that depends on if you consider zero a digit. Yeah, it's one

05:48.200 --> 05:54.660
I guess it's that would be now that the definition of zero is a mathematical value between positive and negative values

05:54.660 --> 05:56.660
So I do not think that is a single

05:57.700 --> 05:59.060
single number

05:59.060 --> 06:02.180
But if I had ten you would say that's a digit number

06:04.220 --> 06:09.620
Your shot and you blew actually dead to me stranger Griffin, yeah, what's your count of hocus-pocus, too

06:09.620 --> 06:12.620
I can't believe you'd even ask me something like that

06:13.900 --> 06:16.180
You old dog. What's the number?

06:18.300 --> 06:25.020
Two is the number at the end of the film hocus-pocus, too. You thought and here's what's fucked up. Yeah

06:25.580 --> 06:27.580
It's scary that

06:27.820 --> 06:31.260
in the first movie these three

06:32.940 --> 06:38.320
Sorcerers did a lot of pretty heinous shit mostly two kids and we have a lot of fun

06:38.320 --> 06:39.520
watching

06:39.520 --> 06:45.160
Watching bet fly around on her vacuum or whatever and we love to see Kathy and a Jimmy up there

06:45.160 --> 06:51.120
Just like making us bust up but like they were trained to for sure kill some kids and they kill some kids

06:51.240 --> 06:54.060
Yeah, they definitely they're they're KD Raich

06:55.040 --> 06:57.280
vis-a-vis kids is higher than

06:58.080 --> 07:01.040
Acceptable limits they killed at least two kids

07:01.280 --> 07:07.320
This is what I wanted to speak on and I'm gonna try to not go into hocus-pocus to spoil you too much

07:07.320 --> 07:13.560
But because I know the community's seen it but you know, you never know maybe people scheduling it

07:14.920 --> 07:16.920
these these these

07:17.640 --> 07:19.640
ladies, yeah, really

07:20.000 --> 07:25.640
Stretch of the definition because they don't act very ladylike. No, thank you. Thank you Travis

07:25.640 --> 07:30.400
So, you know half of their story search. All right. Yeah, you know what egg on my face

07:30.400 --> 07:33.000
I think became cultural icons

07:33.000 --> 07:39.240
Right and it to an extent where and they were so I would say this is like they're memetic, you know

07:40.800 --> 07:48.520
The returns of Sanders and sisters and I just I gotta wonder how many times Disney have been like we really wish

07:49.120 --> 07:51.640
We hadn't had them eat kids. Yeah

07:53.080 --> 07:55.080
We went pretty hard on that

07:55.200 --> 08:02.200
Yeah, and the first time you see the Sanders and sisters in this new movie hocus-pocus, too

08:02.200 --> 08:05.640
they are immediately doing a rendition of

08:06.200 --> 08:08.200
the bitch is back, but

08:09.040 --> 08:11.960
It's the witches. Oh shit, which is her back

08:12.560 --> 08:16.920
That's a media the three of them and it's like split-screen like do do do do

08:16.920 --> 08:17.160
Yeah

08:17.160 --> 08:20.920
And I was watching it with about eight people and everybody's kind of like a the same

08:21.040 --> 08:25.280
Sisters got bopping around and I'm kind of thinking myself. They do kill kids. They kill any

08:26.280 --> 08:27.520
Sure

08:27.520 --> 08:32.700
They killed so many kids. We had to kill them and then you put them on enough

08:33.200 --> 08:37.120
Fucking Halloween costumes. Yeah, and all of a sudden it's like well, what's a kid?

08:37.120 --> 08:41.440
I don't I bet you could charge and I'm I don't hold me to the timeline of this

08:41.440 --> 08:45.240
But it seems to me that you could chart like Disney did hocus-pocus

08:46.000 --> 08:49.020
definite 100% kid death and then

08:49.880 --> 08:53.880
Subsequent Disney films, especially the made-for-tv ones. They're like we got a mummy

08:53.880 --> 09:00.000
I think there's a werewolf in there either leprechaun, but zero kid death in them even in like under wraps

09:00.000 --> 09:05.720
The mummy is like pretty chill. Yeah, never kills a kid and it was like they were like we

09:06.040 --> 09:11.840
We went hard on that one and everyone seems to love the ones that killed the kids the most

09:11.840 --> 09:12.280
Yeah

09:12.280 --> 09:17.760
None of the other ones hit as hard as the three ladies who murdered a child in the first five minutes

09:17.760 --> 09:24.620
Everyone's just wild about these these ladies that murder and what scares me is that they can't they can't be killed. So it's like

09:24.960 --> 09:26.960
law of large numbers eventually

09:27.600 --> 09:30.600
Every kid is done. So every child is done

09:30.600 --> 09:37.620
So leave no child left behind out of their cauldron where they will mash them into some sort of hold

09:38.520 --> 09:40.520
anti-aging poultice

09:40.920 --> 09:47.120
Style yeah style and there's nothing we can do about it because they can't die. It's not fair

09:47.120 --> 09:50.680
It's a joke from God on us. Hey Justin

09:50.680 --> 09:56.180
Can you tell me one thing and this is a spoiler, of course, but and everybody jump ahead three seconds. He's Salem in it

09:56.760 --> 09:57.980
Salem

09:57.980 --> 10:04.480
Do you do you mean you don't mean Salem Salem's from oh, you're right, right, right the cat arena the teenager

10:05.080 --> 10:06.840
binks binks

10:06.840 --> 10:09.480
Binks factory binks. I can't believe

10:09.480 --> 10:15.520
Fucking forgot that name you remember his first name. Yes, but you forget his cat

10:15.520 --> 10:20.400
I'm factory being a voice by Jason Marsden played by a different actor in the film

10:21.140 --> 10:25.840
Which I love because they basically said we don't want it to look like Jason Marsden and we don't want it to sound like you

10:25.840 --> 10:34.400
I mean that happened but not since David Prowse and James Earl Jones

10:42.440 --> 10:48.240
I actually don't know. It's inconclusive Travis. Wait, how many times have you seen the film doesn't

10:48.240 --> 10:54.760
I will say this infinitely more than you guys

10:54.760 --> 10:57.880
Okay, did you did you have to cover your eyes through most of it justice?

10:58.920 --> 11:00.440
None of it was very scary

11:00.440 --> 11:08.160
I will I will give you one incredible twist that I did not see coming and this is really gonna freak you out

11:08.640 --> 11:11.120
Sam Richardson is a treasure and a huge

11:11.800 --> 11:13.800
addition to the film so

11:13.800 --> 11:19.200
Twist Sam Richardson is bringing his a-game and is a delight is for every phrase Doug Jones back

11:19.200 --> 11:22.380
It's Billy Butchers Billy Butcherson Billy the zombie

11:23.040 --> 11:27.840
Billy Billy for zombie Billy was always back and hanky-panky

11:27.840 --> 11:43.000
Yeah, it's good, it's uh, yeah, there's probably a lot of reasons why it's immoral to recommend it hocus-pocus, too

11:46.720 --> 11:48.720
Let's uh, this is an advice show

11:49.760 --> 11:55.680
Quick Yeti update. I received four offers of a Yeti cooler since our last recording

11:55.680 --> 12:00.440
I got an expiring soon. Your name came up for a Yeti hopper cooler

12:00.440 --> 12:07.900
Well, I've been chosen for a Yeti hopper into any cooler. Yeah, please verify where to send the newest model yet. Hurry up

12:08.480 --> 12:14.680
Confirm now another Yeti backpack cooler. I've won so many of these things. Yeah, you all would not even believe

12:14.680 --> 12:20.600
So what are you doing with all of yeah, what are you gonna do with it? Yeah, you don't really live I would say a cooler

12:20.600 --> 12:25.120
Lifestyle, you're not usually out in places where you

12:25.880 --> 12:27.880
Don't have access to cold

12:28.320 --> 12:29.640
beverages and in fact

12:29.640 --> 12:35.440
I would go so far as to say Griffin that Justin has arranged a lot of his like decisions to make sure he's never too

12:35.440 --> 12:42.040
Far away from a place where he could put things to become cold. That's a great. Yeah, it's a great question. I've received

12:42.040 --> 12:50.880
I have one according to the spam folder of my email. I've won 30 for Yeti coolers shit. Hey, yeah, it's May

12:51.880 --> 12:57.560
Yeah, but that's how they get you because what they want me to do is pay for shipping. Mm-hmm. I bet on each one

12:57.600 --> 12:58.920
So I'm not gonna do that

12:58.920 --> 13:04.000
I'm gonna wait until it seems like the tide has stemmed of Yeti coolers that I have won and

13:04.320 --> 13:06.880
Then I will say ship them all to me. Oh

13:06.880 --> 13:12.040
Oh in one in bulk. I think our I think cool. I think our nation's

13:14.040 --> 13:18.920
Dwindling beautiful Yeti population is how are you having a tough enough time?

13:19.160 --> 13:26.600
Yeah, we don't need to be killing them and turning their you know, it's a cavity sort of chest cavities into

13:27.560 --> 13:33.000
Beer beer. I got pretty serious. You really brought it down. Go funding didn't expect it to go such a place

13:33.360 --> 13:35.360
This is an advice show

13:35.360 --> 13:36.800
and

13:36.800 --> 13:41.480
I'm so thrilled to be here. We were we missed you last week, and I'm happy to be back. That's all there is to it

13:42.120 --> 13:48.600
Sorry. Yeah, sorry. I got coven San Jose Denver. We're sorry. I felt so terrible. He really did

13:48.600 --> 13:53.800
You really thought I was worried about him. Yeah, we all feel bad. I had to be with my I

13:54.320 --> 13:57.880
Had to be with my family all week. I didn't get to go to the Winchester Mystery House

13:58.520 --> 14:03.200
Which I was really planning to let's just say but we've all suffered. Yeah, we've all suffered

14:03.200 --> 14:09.880
You guys through your own violence by not watching hocus-pocus, too. That's a suffering you've brought on yourself. I'm good

14:09.880 --> 14:14.720
Ah, I'm looking to get some advice on what to do if you're at a super fancy and official art auction

14:14.720 --> 14:17.200
Yes, where people raise little numbered signs to bet on art

14:18.120 --> 14:24.560
Best the best the dream dream the dream. I'd be so paranoid right is that I would actually bid. Yeah

14:24.960 --> 14:26.800
Keep reading Justin

14:26.800 --> 14:33.180
What if you goof up and dress all posh and then you get yourself one of the number bid signs and you place a bid

14:33.180 --> 14:38.960
On purpose that you know, you can't pay but you think somebody will immediately outbid you but nobody does and the gavel is struck

14:38.960 --> 14:40.960
You what it what's the best excuse?

14:41.760 --> 14:48.280
Or way to get out of your poor decision-making. That's from Ben who I have to say an extremely specific email Ben

14:48.280 --> 14:50.280
I'm a little bit nervous, but

14:51.480 --> 14:55.640
Relate I'm saying I think Ben may have may have stumbled into this this scenario

14:55.640 --> 15:02.360
Maybe what I've got what I've got is a very particular set of skills by which I mean a very specific anxiety

15:02.360 --> 15:10.080
which I guarantee is shared by like 90% of the adult population and that is the specific anxiety of going to a

15:10.640 --> 15:18.620
event a place whatever where there is a very specific like set the order and of operations in which to do things and

15:18.960 --> 15:22.320
Feeling like everyone else knows exactly what that is

15:22.560 --> 15:28.840
Except me and the chances that I will get in a wrong line go in a wrong door sit in the wrong seat

15:28.840 --> 15:34.280
whatever and even just gently be corrected by another human adult and

15:34.680 --> 15:38.240
Melting to an Alex Mack puddle of shame is so high

15:38.760 --> 15:44.400
That it has stopped me from going to many a fancy art auction, which I'm definitely invited to all the time

15:44.400 --> 15:48.320
I would say two things one. There's always a chance

15:49.000 --> 15:54.120
That as soon as the auction concludes and you just bought it for a billion dollars or whatever

15:54.120 --> 16:02.520
That then the painting frame is actually a shredder like the like Banksy did that one time and it shreds up the painting

16:02.520 --> 16:04.520
And you'll be like, huh? I

16:04.520 --> 16:07.960
Guess I guess I can't buy that one. It's all torn top now

16:08.600 --> 16:10.600
Got me nice

16:10.600 --> 16:13.840
It up and by the way Banksy had to be in the room didn't he?

16:14.240 --> 16:19.680
Like how did how was everybody's first read as soon as that auction closed and the thing fell down through the shutter?

16:19.680 --> 16:25.880
Everybody wasn't like shut the fucking doors lock it down. Nobody's gone until we find out which one of you is Banksy

16:27.240 --> 16:30.200
Hey, everybody real quick raise your hand if you're Banksy got you

16:32.040 --> 16:34.040
Shouldn't raise my hands

16:34.400 --> 16:41.080
Okay, listen not for show but try something talk to over here. We should do like a cozy mystery where

16:41.080 --> 16:49.080
It's locked in in it right after that and the people in there all the fancy people have to figure out who's Banksy

16:49.720 --> 16:53.760
Box me out of that when it was my idea. Well, you might not Banksy Griffin

16:55.000 --> 17:02.320
Justin and I definitely weren't there. We read a lot of mysteries. Yeah. No, I'm I only read sports magazines

17:03.240 --> 17:07.560
You want to do a cozy sports mystery? We could all work on that together. You know, I'll do that myself

17:07.560 --> 17:13.760
I guess with with dad and my fellow sports fan here. This is I I had a second bit

17:13.760 --> 17:18.400
I had it. I had a part. Oh my thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, which is that um

17:18.920 --> 17:20.920
Y'all know how I feel about

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Banksy shoplifting. Oh

17:23.840 --> 17:26.880
This isn't even this isn't even that right?

17:26.880 --> 17:30.960
It's not like you're taking the painting and leaving without paying for it

17:30.960 --> 17:36.260
If you do accidentally spend a million dollars on the thing and then it doesn't self shred

17:36.260 --> 17:37.220
you

17:37.220 --> 17:39.220
Can just stand up and be like, oh

17:39.580 --> 17:45.540
Whoops and walk out leave. They're not gonna stop legally binding. This is true. Are you Travis you have no

17:46.940 --> 17:53.620
Absolutely, no idea. That's true. That is very true. But the idea of my heart tells me it can't be

17:57.100 --> 18:02.620
Unless you're signing the equivalent of like a liability like waiver when you go into an auction

18:02.620 --> 18:08.100
That's just like if I wave my hand at the wrong time. I definitely have to pay you a million dollars to go to jail

18:08.100 --> 18:10.100
But even that Travis even that

18:10.980 --> 18:15.500
Even that I can still just stand up and leave anytime. That's true

18:15.500 --> 18:22.620
There are so few places in this world that you can't just not oops stand up walk out

18:23.000 --> 18:25.740
Prison is the only one I got big. Oh, this is about it

18:25.740 --> 18:33.340
Um, the um, and a locked room mystery. Those are the two I can think of I just had this moment of like imagine

18:33.340 --> 18:36.620
I could really imagining as fun as it sounds to be in this scenario

18:36.620 --> 18:42.500
I just imagined like showing up at one of these and I got all dressed and just walking in the door and just the

18:42.780 --> 18:44.540
overwhelming like

18:44.540 --> 18:45.820
so

18:45.820 --> 18:47.820
The signs do I go get?

18:47.860 --> 18:53.420
Yes, thank a table over there or they got the chairs or is there a specific sign?

18:53.420 --> 18:56.980
I mean like I wouldn't even make it in this far. I would be gone already

18:56.980 --> 19:02.740
I would think you know what? I like, you know what? I like sometimes I end up at these for like Sydney's functions

19:02.980 --> 19:04.980
Sometimes there's a silent

19:07.100 --> 19:09.620
Love a silent one loved a scope for deals

19:10.500 --> 19:16.520
Someone brought a basket that they thought would fetch a high price and no one's bidding on it. Maybe I scoop in there

19:16.520 --> 19:23.120
Oh, yeah. Yeah, get a look get a get a knife then you get your hover going where it's just like it's value to 250

19:23.120 --> 19:27.780
I put down like eight bucks. No one signed. Yeah, I'm just gonna stand by it. Oh, you're gonna bid on that

19:27.780 --> 19:30.820
I wouldn't if I read you wouldn't this is your name

19:34.980 --> 19:36.980
They don't want to carry that basket of

19:39.340 --> 19:41.500
Fancy wines and golf tees home

19:41.500 --> 19:48.060
Can you imagine the panic that any one of us any any socially anxious person like ourselves?

19:48.060 --> 19:55.620
Would feel sitting in the seat holding the paddle while the like auctioneer person is scanning the room and you're thinking don't blink

19:55.820 --> 20:02.860
Don't flinch. I can't if I make any move this guy's horny for movement. He's gonna be like what you

20:04.020 --> 20:09.020
Velociraptor for sure. I saw episode curious George one time where George

20:09.580 --> 20:13.380
didn't understand the difference between 10 and 100 and

20:14.260 --> 20:16.700
Accident because he's a fucking monkey guys

20:16.700 --> 20:19.940
Yeah, every moment of his life is a miracle

20:21.980 --> 20:24.860
Holds him actually way too accountable if you see

20:25.420 --> 20:28.860
Everyone's like George Warren is like he's a fucking monkey guys

20:29.300 --> 20:32.740
Hold the yellow-hatted man the yellow-hatted man brought him back

20:32.740 --> 20:37.460
There's a Christmas special that basically boils down to the yellow hat man screaming at him

20:37.460 --> 20:43.200
Tell me what you want for Christmas, it's like it's a monkey dog. He wants banana

20:44.620 --> 20:49.060
He wants to go back to the fucking jungle where no one judges him for being curious

20:49.060 --> 20:52.460
But anyway, somebody who can't leave anytime he wants there's George

20:52.460 --> 20:54.780
There's an episode where he doesn't know difference between 10 and 100

20:54.780 --> 21:02.740
He accidentally like spends a hundred dollars at an auction for some mittens and the man in yellow hat is like I'm fucking ruined

21:03.860 --> 21:05.820
2022 and he's like a docent

21:05.820 --> 21:11.660
He doesn't have that kind of case just floating around and so what they have to do is they find

21:12.100 --> 21:17.340
Like a rich old weirdo that then they sell the gloves to for $100

21:17.980 --> 21:23.700
So why so you accidentally buy this painting for let's say

21:24.620 --> 21:27.980
$15,000 and you're like, oh fuck and they'll be like, all right, come on up bring your checkbook

21:28.220 --> 21:35.100
You go up to the microphone and be like actually everyone the auctions still going now. I'm auctioning it

21:35.100 --> 21:37.740
Oh right around we're gonna start at

21:38.500 --> 21:43.260
$15,000, but I'm gonna do a way better job of selling this thing than this fucking chuckle clown

21:44.060 --> 21:48.940
If you are in the middle of the auction and it's like going once can you beg wait timeout timeout?

21:48.940 --> 21:52.520
Come on, and you go over to the person you're bidding against you're like, do you want to split it?

21:52.660 --> 21:55.460
Like I'll give you get it on Mondays and Wednesdays

21:55.460 --> 22:00.860
I'm out you bid $1 over what I said and I'll give you a dollar like well

22:00.860 --> 22:06.460
We'll just call it you have it at my price. I'll give you a dollar over please. Hey, please

22:06.820 --> 22:11.420
Please don't you and I bid as a goof and hey, why are you laughing?

22:11.500 --> 22:18.500
This is my fucking life. I have I work at a bank. I don't have this money man. Come on

22:19.940 --> 22:21.940
Hey, do y'all want to

22:21.940 --> 22:29.320
Approach the wizard. I'd love to Griff. Okay. This one was sent in by Jennifer. Thank you Jennifer the Wizards familiar

22:29.320 --> 22:30.900
Jennifer

22:30.900 --> 22:38.300
And it's a wiki how article called how to become a loving and caring Pokemon trainer with your plush. Yes, wait with your

22:39.020 --> 22:41.020
plush with your plush

22:41.140 --> 22:44.180
your plush your plush Pokemon, I don't think plush is like

22:45.260 --> 22:46.780
some sort of

22:46.780 --> 22:51.340
Like Gen Z slang for a sexual partner or something like that

22:51.660 --> 22:55.420
Because I don't even know how that sentence would make any sense if that is the case

22:55.420 --> 23:01.680
Mm-hmm. So you're a devoted Pokemon fan, right? Yeah, and you want to have a physical part of the game in your life

23:01.680 --> 23:04.420
Yep. Well, this article is gonna show you how with a Pokemon plush

23:05.280 --> 23:06.640
Okay

23:06.640 --> 23:13.480
Step one making it real start out by getting your first or second Pokemon plush. Wait. Yeah, I don't know

23:14.680 --> 23:16.880
Like what is the first?

23:16.880 --> 23:20.880
Oh, maybe you already have your first one and you're like I didn't make that one real enough. Yeah

23:20.880 --> 23:27.200
Oh, I chewed way too much on my first one. It is so it is so heavy with my slobber

23:27.200 --> 23:32.760
There is I have to get a fresh one to start. I can't imbue it with any kind of reality at this point

23:33.360 --> 23:36.800
This will be your companion for the rest of your journey. You should make sure you will love them forever

23:36.800 --> 23:42.000
So choose a plush Pokemon character you like and in the picture here, they have chosen

23:42.520 --> 23:45.120
What I can only describe as an off-brand

23:46.280 --> 23:47.960
noseless Pikachu

23:47.960 --> 23:51.760
So I don't want they don't they don't need that extra the IP loss

23:52.360 --> 23:57.640
This isn't a branded partnership between Pokemon and wiki. Oh, yeah

23:58.600 --> 24:02.760
Nicknames are important because that is what your Pokemon will go by it may be determined by gender

24:02.760 --> 24:07.920
But some Pokemon don't have gender so choose something that fits them best. That's cool. What plush would you guys pick?

24:10.160 --> 24:15.160
Probably I mean mega Rayquaza has the highest stats still of all that's not the right

24:15.160 --> 24:22.200
Oh, come on about you Justin. Okay. Wow. Well Travis you're you are famously the Pokemon expert of the family. So

24:23.200 --> 24:24.240
ghostly

24:24.240 --> 24:26.240
No, it's Evie. I

24:27.160 --> 24:28.800
mean that's so that's

24:28.800 --> 24:33.360
A lot of funnier name in Pokemon. Maybe we can Evie's the best one Evie has so much potential

24:33.560 --> 24:35.200
What will it be? That's up to me?

24:35.200 --> 24:39.400
Whatever I nickname it and Pokemon go and to cure is a dog. Is it a fox?

24:39.400 --> 24:42.280
Oh, do you mean two of the cutest animals on earth fucking dog?

24:42.280 --> 24:44.400
Travis just listen

24:45.160 --> 24:47.880
Listen with your listening ears nicknames are important

24:47.880 --> 24:52.800
I do want to say that I've played quite a few Pokemon games with Henry and he has a delightful way of nicknaming Pokemon

24:52.800 --> 24:58.400
Which is that he wants them to have the strongest sounding name ever and so every Pokemon that we catch we caught one

24:58.760 --> 25:03.760
As it was a legendary Pokemon in his defense, but he did call it king of gods, which felt

25:06.760 --> 25:08.760
Yeah, fuck yeah, dude

25:08.760 --> 25:15.080
The same naming convention is like Godzilla movies and I love that and then make your trainer name

25:15.080 --> 25:19.000
This is what your Pokemon will call you. I have Griffin is fine. Yeah

25:25.160 --> 25:30.240
Making a home find a secret place that pets and siblings can't get to for this will be your Pokemon. So

25:31.800 --> 25:33.800
Don't get in my weed Pokemon

25:33.800 --> 25:39.160
Hey, hey ball picks get out of there. You're not ready for that. There's one place like my rotten kids can't reach

25:39.160 --> 25:43.480
So you got to keep an eye on my sash pal. It's daddy's high up stinky shelf. You don't

25:44.000 --> 25:48.240
No one gets to know get up. We don't talk about stinky shelf

25:48.240 --> 25:49.640
No, no

25:49.640 --> 25:55.400
Get a pillow and a light blanket. The pillow will be the mattress and the blanket will keep them warm

25:55.400 --> 25:58.560
So blanket, I mean, it's a plush doll. Yeah

25:59.200 --> 26:03.120
Yeah, so what you were trying to lay on a pillow? That's not comfortable. It's not how about you?

26:03.120 --> 26:05.120
Just get a very how much you just get a twin bed

26:06.000 --> 26:08.880
Tiny Casper a baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

26:09.080 --> 26:14.000
Tempur-pedic like a little one like a little guy. Maybe you find a Tempur-pedic mattress at the mattress store. Bring a knife

26:14.640 --> 26:19.520
Cut a little corner off of it. And that's all of a sudden. That's that's a bed for your war turtle

26:20.520 --> 26:22.520
and then food

26:23.000 --> 26:30.880
Get some fake food to feed your plush such as clay puffins poke blocks berries and poke puffs or doll food

26:30.880 --> 26:35.640
Did you say did you say clay puffins when you meant to say play coffins? Yeah

26:36.040 --> 26:39.320
Yeah, feed your feed your Snorlax some play coffins

26:40.440 --> 26:42.360
Snorlax

26:42.360 --> 26:44.360
Consume he consumes

26:45.160 --> 26:49.680
And so in his favorite food is he just sticks his huge

26:50.640 --> 26:55.400
powerful arms deep in the ground and rips coffins out of them and then just but the fun ones

26:55.400 --> 27:02.140
Play coffins the fun play coffins the ones with toys and games on the outside of it and he just fucking eats them

27:03.020 --> 27:06.000
Happy Halloween. I do love the

27:07.160 --> 27:12.640
quick just almost instantaneous abandon abandonment of the concept of

27:13.080 --> 27:16.820
Feed it Pokemon food or just doll food, which I don't know what that is

27:17.440 --> 27:23.920
Is that just I'll tell you exactly what that is Griffin. That's the author of the wiki how article realized that you halfway through the sentence

27:23.920 --> 27:31.680
Oh, wait, I just said sibling this person would have to ask their parents to go buy them some clay puffins and some fake bear

27:31.680 --> 27:35.640
You know what anything you got lying around will be fine. Don't ask your parents about this

27:36.160 --> 27:39.240
Don't make a nest out of detritus from your home. This is fine

27:39.240 --> 27:43.040
This is you could just draw write the word food on a piece of paper and hand it to the book

27:43.040 --> 27:48.520
What it'll be fine. Don't worry about it. Yeah, the next step is you can spoon feed it to your plush

27:48.520 --> 27:51.900
That's all it says and that is where that is

27:51.900 --> 27:54.640
I mean, I've taken umbrage with a few of the points of this article so far

27:54.640 --> 27:59.900
But I do think that if Pokemon was real like I pray to Christ every night and make wishes on stars

28:02.880 --> 28:04.880
That that would be my reality

28:05.880 --> 28:07.880
the idea that my

28:09.120 --> 28:12.200
considerable Pokemon collection because I'm not gonna be like

28:12.440 --> 28:16.040
I'm not gonna be like ash Ketchum out there where it's like, how'd I do this week?

28:16.040 --> 28:22.800
Well, I got a Metapod and that's it like I would be out there like grinding it the fuck out trying to fill out

28:22.800 --> 28:24.840
the decks the idea that then like

28:25.440 --> 28:26.880
every night

28:26.880 --> 28:31.640
My friends would be like hey Griffin come out and party with us and be like I can't I have to spoon feed

28:32.680 --> 28:40.080
Every single one of my Pokemon or they'll they will die just because they go in the little balls doesn't mean that their body functions are

28:41.000 --> 28:42.600
Suspended they shit and piss in there

28:42.600 --> 28:48.320
They need to eat and plus guys if I don't spoon for you, mr. Mime specifically he gets

28:49.480 --> 28:55.680
Angry, he gets right here. He waits. He wakes me up standing by the side of my bed just pointing at his mouth

28:55.680 --> 29:02.560
That's holding up a spoon. That's another great point. You're gonna have to spoon feed even the dude shaped Pokemon. Yeah

29:03.760 --> 29:09.360
That looks like just a tiny blonde woman in a red dress. Yeah, the one that's a duty who moves around

29:09.360 --> 29:15.120
Yeah, hit Monchan is just gonna be sitting in front of you and he's gonna try to pick up the fucking spoon with his boxing

29:15.120 --> 29:19.760
Gloves, but he can't and so he's just gonna have to sit there like can you please this is so humiliating

29:20.720 --> 29:24.280
Goroh's brother may champ is there and he's like feed

29:24.880 --> 29:26.880
I'm big go faster

29:27.400 --> 29:29.880
Give you a big hug. Yes. Thank you. May champ

29:31.880 --> 29:37.320
Bonding have fun together go to parks take it every place you can't when you can't wait until you can go back home and have

29:37.320 --> 29:39.600
Some extra fun. Just what?

29:40.520 --> 29:46.000
What do you think that means? I don't want to I don't want to go to take it everywhere

29:46.320 --> 29:48.320
What Pokemon would you least like this?

29:49.320 --> 29:52.320
What Pokemon would I least like the spoon feed? Yeah

29:53.040 --> 29:55.760
Muck mr. My mind's mr. Mime muck

29:56.320 --> 29:59.240
Muck muck and or his terrible

29:59.760 --> 30:05.080
Little brother Grimer one of those two a lowland variant traditional muck. Whatever man

30:05.080 --> 30:09.960
I do the last thing that I need is a living pile of slime in my house bigger than I am

30:09.960 --> 30:15.160
We just I spilled coffee on these carpets that we had put in when we moved into this house in DC

30:15.160 --> 30:18.960
And it that's like there forever and I have to struggle with that every time I look down

30:19.640 --> 30:24.200
At below my desk I see the big brown stain there and it looks like it could be dookie

30:24.200 --> 30:27.120
And I know that like my friends are gonna see my cool office and be like wait a minute

30:27.120 --> 30:33.240
Is that dookie the the idea that I would invite a big slime monster in my house who would do not only destroy my carpets

30:33.240 --> 30:35.840
And get all my stuff all sticky. He would be like

30:37.240 --> 30:44.080
Mike sucks. I don't want any part of that. I was recently made aware of the punk of the Pokemon

30:44.720 --> 30:49.320
Throw. Yeah, who looks like just a large man in a karate gi

30:49.400 --> 30:54.000
Yeah, and the idea of this just like guy looming over me like just

30:54.000 --> 31:00.980
Just opening itself and me having to spoon feed this giant in a human karate gi

31:01.080 --> 31:02.440
Yeah, it's like that

31:02.440 --> 31:05.440
I'd rather have a slime monster in my house

31:05.440 --> 31:10.880
So I'm just like that's a monster in my house that I have to appease as opposed to just a needy roommate

31:10.880 --> 31:13.100
Yeah, it's a man. Justin. Did you have one?

31:14.040 --> 31:19.960
No, I said mr. Mime. I I I don't like mr. Mime. I don't like the way mr. Mime looks. Yeah

31:19.960 --> 31:26.840
I don't like he has anything about his name. He has a title like it like he his name is mister

31:26.840 --> 31:30.940
It implies he has a first name. Yeah, mr. Mr. Jeremy Mime

31:32.800 --> 31:33.760
I

31:33.760 --> 31:39.680
Recently found out about Mimikyu and I don't like that one at all either. Yeah, Travis. Have you seen Mimikyu?

31:39.680 --> 31:44.120
No, maybe a long way. I can I can show you Mimikyu. Hold on. I can't believe it

31:44.120 --> 31:50.440
You guys are sending each other Pokemon JPEGs in the background. This is this legit. This is what you dreamed Griff. Yeah, it's like a

31:50.480 --> 31:53.600
It's like it. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no

31:53.600 --> 32:00.260
I feel like if a little monster killed Pikachu and yeah skin and then wore it. I'm Pikachu now pika me

32:00.880 --> 32:05.120
Have have sleepovers. It's fun and you can invite your friends and socialize probably not obviously

32:05.120 --> 32:07.480
I think we all sleep below my Pokemon shelf tonight

32:08.120 --> 32:11.980
Cool, cool. It's super sturdy. My dad put it in real good

32:11.980 --> 32:18.580
He said we could have the different shelves too because I don't have that many Pokemon yet. Also keep your grades over. Mr.

32:18.580 --> 32:20.580
Mom, I'm bugging with you

32:21.260 --> 32:24.220
Yeah, it doesn't say to keep your grades up but obviously implied

32:25.940 --> 32:29.180
Hey, you gotta stop hanging out with mr. Mime he's a bad influence on you

32:30.500 --> 32:32.500
Don't listen to that asshole

32:34.180 --> 32:36.180
If you don't have enough badges

32:36.300 --> 32:39.460
Pokemon will not listen to the shit that you say and I love that

32:39.460 --> 32:43.100
I think that's a great if you have a Pokemon that's stronger than

32:43.460 --> 32:50.380
You are as a person and you don't have a badge that boat was like get the fuck it use hydro pump fuck off

32:50.860 --> 32:56.340
You're not my dad. I went to college. I went to college blast toys is my dad

32:56.380 --> 33:00.180
You're just you're just Griffin a dude who threw a ball at me

33:00.500 --> 33:03.360
Once and now you get to tell me exactly what to do

33:03.360 --> 33:09.620
And I was pretty drunk on berries at the time which seems unfair. I do not think this is a fair arrangement

33:10.140 --> 33:13.280
Anyway, let me out of the ball. That's how to become a loving

33:13.940 --> 33:16.900
Pokemon loving and caring Pokemon trainer with your plush

33:17.700 --> 33:21.700
Alright, let's uh, let's take a quick break. We'll be right back after this

33:21.700 --> 33:23.700
This

33:32.140 --> 33:36.980
Would anyone like to do very would you like to hear a very professional ad read? Yeah

33:40.260 --> 33:44.140
Hi, my name is Justin McElroy and when I'm out podcasting

33:44.140 --> 33:51.740
I don't have time to build a lot of websites my kids and their friends. They all come to me the tech dad and

33:52.500 --> 33:58.020
I don't have time to build them each a website about the different things that they like like puppet toys or Pringles

33:58.060 --> 34:01.820
So luckily there is for busy dads like me Squarespace

34:01.980 --> 34:03.980
They will make whatever

34:03.980 --> 34:10.580
Website that your kids want you to make in a fast way that it won't look like you did it though because they have world-class

34:10.580 --> 34:16.120
Templates created by the best designers the best people in the game easy

34:16.120 --> 34:21.020
And if you can't figure it out, there's got the the best customer service in the business

34:22.300 --> 34:24.140
24-7

34:24.140 --> 34:26.060
Hey, sorry, just real quick

34:26.060 --> 34:31.700
Can I give you a couple notes as you're going one when you said Ted dad made you sound like you're a robotic dad

34:32.220 --> 34:35.940
We actually love that if you could lean into that a little harder with some good angle

34:35.940 --> 34:41.740
Simpsons also you are kind of making it sound like you tell Squarespace what kind of website your kids run and they'll build

34:42.300 --> 34:44.300
And that is not the service

34:45.340 --> 34:47.660
So that's just a quick note from

34:49.260 --> 34:51.260
Actually, I wish you'd let me finish the copy

34:52.740 --> 34:56.460
Yeah, please but do leaning to the robot dad thing, okay, listen

34:57.180 --> 35:00.980
Travis no more notes. Let me finish. They're just reading what's what's here on the page

35:00.980 --> 35:06.220
Okay, like a lot of cybernetic dads whose hearts have been replaced with oil. I don't have the time to build

35:06.660 --> 35:10.900
Websites for my kids and neither the Squarespace a lot of people get confused about this

35:11.300 --> 35:16.120
This ad is to clarify that the cyber dads are the ones building the sites

35:16.380 --> 35:23.540
The Squarespace is just metaphorically speaking the oil on their lubes and gears and typing ones

35:24.380 --> 35:28.180
so I mean if you're not sold already then

35:28.180 --> 35:31.020
the oil in your heart has gone stayed

35:31.900 --> 35:33.900
because

35:33.900 --> 35:36.080
Like that more tech that stuff

35:37.500 --> 35:42.060

36:49.700 --> 36:53.740

But did you also know that socks underwear and t-shirts are the three most requested clothing items at homeless shelters

37:14.420 --> 37:18.660
That's why Bombas donates one for every item you buy so far Bombas customers
