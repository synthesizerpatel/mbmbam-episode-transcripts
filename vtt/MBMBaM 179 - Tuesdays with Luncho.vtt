00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:50.640
Hello, everyone, and welcome to our Candlelight Eve Eve episode of My Brother, My Brother, Me,

00:50.640 --> 00:54.320
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:54.320 --> 00:56.320
I'm your middle-aged brother, Travis McElroy.

00:56.320 --> 01:02.080
I am your sweet baby Jesus in a manger, even though that's not really Candlelight's canon

01:02.080 --> 01:07.600
McElroy. It's more like sweet baby Stephen in an oversized down comforter.

01:07.600 --> 01:12.400
There probably was a baby named Stephen born on Candlelight's at some point in history.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.320
Speaking of what- And they probably put him in a barn.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.320
What day does Candlelight's fall on this year?

01:18.320 --> 01:21.600
You have to consult the calendar handed out by your local butcher.

01:21.600 --> 01:25.920
You have your butcher's calendar, don't you? Just check your butcher's calendar.

01:26.480 --> 01:27.680
Why would he have his hands on that?

01:28.880 --> 01:31.840
Because he also makes calendars to raise money for his butcher business.

01:31.840 --> 01:34.240
Butcher business doesn't rake it in like it used to.

01:34.240 --> 01:37.680
This feels like a very local occurrence, though.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.400
Do people all go to my butcher to find out what day it is,

01:40.400 --> 01:42.160
or are they just relying on me to break this news out?

01:42.160 --> 01:45.840
Well, he has a website. I mean, goddamn it, Griffin, it's 2013.

01:45.840 --> 01:53.600
Nice, that's a good point. The Candlelight's is an agnostic pan-religious pansexual

01:53.600 --> 01:57.760
celebration of all things personal pan-sized. Hydroponic.

01:59.440 --> 02:07.200
It's automatic. It is much like Greased Lightning in that it is a real pussy wagon,

02:07.200 --> 02:12.080
and it is a holiday for men and women, boys and girls.

02:12.080 --> 02:16.480
You know, we are coming up on it. It is fast approaching. Open up the advent calendar.

02:16.480 --> 02:18.880
Pop this window open. How many days left?

02:18.880 --> 02:19.600
What's back there?

02:21.200 --> 02:22.880
It's Griffin's pinky toe.

02:22.880 --> 02:23.680
It's my pinky toe.

02:26.320 --> 02:30.480
You know how Thanksgiving and Hanukkah were at the same time this year?

02:30.480 --> 02:32.960
It's like the first time that it's happened in like 5,000 years.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
Candlelight's can't do that shit because Candlelight's will like fucking eat the other

02:38.000 --> 02:43.920
holiday and gain its nutrients and power. It's like a parasitic vine, you know,

02:43.920 --> 02:48.000
where it wraps around and then the thing inside dies and then it looks like the whole tree is

02:48.000 --> 02:48.960
like flowering. But don't touch it.

02:50.320 --> 02:54.080
It'll spit poison at you. It'll spit poison at you. What a fun holiday.

02:54.080 --> 03:01.200
I figure Christmas as a holiday has maybe five to six more months before it's just

03:01.200 --> 03:06.560
completely overtaken by Candlelight's. Once our branding train starts going,

03:06.560 --> 03:13.360
and then it'll hit Christmas. Imagine Christmas as a man and then it'll hit him and then,

03:13.360 --> 03:15.360
you know, how his trains hit men.

03:15.360 --> 03:21.360
It's basically Christmas and dreidels and latkes and Kwanzaa songs.

03:21.920 --> 03:26.800
Yeah. So we took the best parts of each holiday, right? Like Kwanzaa songs clearly beat the ever

03:26.800 --> 03:33.920
loving shit out of Christmas songs, out of Hanukkah songs. But Hanukkah has the best breads.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.440
Mm hmm.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.640
But Christmas, you know, we got the trees, you know, those are smelling pretty good.

03:38.640 --> 03:41.680
So we got sights, we got smells, we got sounds, we got flavors, we got touches.

03:41.680 --> 03:42.880
Candlelight's.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.640
Candlelight's. Catch the wave.

03:44.640 --> 03:48.080
And in case anyone was wondering, the Candlelight's, the color scheme is more of,

03:48.080 --> 03:51.440
sort of like the red and green, because that's too, you know, that's been done.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.800
We do like a purple and brown, kind of like peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

03:54.800 --> 03:55.920
Kind of like a PBJ.

03:55.920 --> 04:02.320
Our Candlelight's special episode will be going up on the 23rd, I guess,

04:02.320 --> 04:09.840
and that will be a cuss-free, calling it cussing makes me laugh, cuss-free episode of our show.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.000
No wordy nerds at all.

04:12.560 --> 04:15.680
Appropriate for the whole family, except conceptually.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.960
Conceptually, it'll still be challenging material.

04:20.320 --> 04:22.800
The ideas will be adult. You know what it'll be? It'll be like a,

04:22.800 --> 04:26.000
it'll be like a particularly raunchy episode of Married with Children.

04:26.000 --> 04:26.500
Yeah.

04:27.200 --> 04:31.040
It'll be, there'll be a lot of Christina Applegate in this particular episode.

04:31.040 --> 04:31.540
Yeah.

04:31.540 --> 04:33.840
And I'm doing a lot of suggested things. Maybe there's a car wash.

04:36.560 --> 04:39.040
You won't see any areola, you won't see any areolas or nothing,

04:39.040 --> 04:40.640
but you'll like know that they're there.

04:40.640 --> 04:44.640
She gets acid in her eyes and has to take a chemical shower and lab class.

04:44.640 --> 04:48.320
You'll be, you'll be areola adjacent if you spend the candlelight's with us.

04:48.320 --> 04:51.040
You'll know you're there. You'll know they're there.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.080
You will know they're there.

04:52.080 --> 04:53.520
There will be no doubt about it.

04:53.520 --> 04:56.080
This is an advice show, so let's do it.

04:56.800 --> 05:00.640
Hey brothers, I've been dating a woman for about six months and things are going well.

05:00.640 --> 05:03.920
Problem, her birthday is a week before Christmas,

05:03.920 --> 05:06.560
so in the past it's been lumped in with the holiday.

05:06.560 --> 05:10.960
Any ideas for how to make her birthday special and have it stand out from the holidays?

05:10.960 --> 05:14.400
Right now I'm planning on taking her out to dinner, but not sure what else to do.

05:15.120 --> 05:18.080
And that's thanks timing troubles in Texas.

05:18.720 --> 05:23.280
Can you, can you not just have a birthday party?

05:24.000 --> 05:25.280
It's too close though, right?

05:25.280 --> 05:28.960
Like is your worry that it will accidentally become a Christmas party?

05:28.960 --> 05:32.320
Ha shit, they showed up in sweaters with presents.

05:32.320 --> 05:34.160
No, but like eggnog everywhere.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.840
Christmas is the most wonderful time of the year.

05:35.840 --> 05:38.880
It beats the shit out of any birthday you could ever possibly have, right?

05:38.880 --> 05:40.720
So when you have them that close together,

05:41.600 --> 05:44.960
I think that there's, there's just sort of a natural comparison that goes on there.

05:44.960 --> 05:48.240
And people say, well, it was nice, but, um, you know,

05:48.240 --> 05:50.880
my entire family wasn't there and there wasn't eggnog.

05:51.840 --> 05:55.680
Uh, the other benefit to candlelight's is that you never have this problem.

05:55.680 --> 06:02.560
Candlelight's is so long that about one third to two thirds of the population

06:02.560 --> 06:06.720
has a birthday in or near candlelight's.

06:06.720 --> 06:07.840
It is hard to get away from it.

06:07.840 --> 06:10.400
We cover like four astrological signs.

06:10.400 --> 06:13.840
With most holidays, there's a debate as to when you can start decorating.

06:14.480 --> 06:18.080
For the holiday with candlelight's, the question is when you can stop decorating.

06:18.080 --> 06:19.200
You just can't.

06:19.200 --> 06:22.800
And usually it's just when the support structures in your house begin to bend

06:22.800 --> 06:26.880
and moan under the weight of the trimmings and the deckings.

06:27.760 --> 06:30.000
Maybe you could decorate her like a birthday tree.

06:31.120 --> 06:33.520
Maybe string some birthday garland.

06:34.080 --> 06:36.080
This is kind of a weird sentence.

06:36.640 --> 06:36.880
What?

06:38.000 --> 06:40.800
You're just sort of conflating like a lot of ideas that don't.

06:40.800 --> 06:44.000
No, like you light some, you light the birthday candles and the birthday wreaths.

06:44.720 --> 06:46.480
Um, you sing some birthday carols.

06:46.480 --> 06:47.600
You light the wreaths?

06:47.600 --> 06:49.360
You light the candles and the wreaths.

06:49.360 --> 06:51.120
It's a fucking exciting birthday.

06:51.120 --> 06:54.160
Well, you gotta, you gotta flameproof the wreath.

06:54.160 --> 06:55.440
Is this your first birthday wreath?

06:56.800 --> 06:58.800
Um, you ever birthday wreath before?

06:58.800 --> 07:01.520
God, if somebody's, if this is somebody's first episode of the podcast and you're like,

07:01.520 --> 07:04.240
who are these fucking clowns that don't understand holidays?

07:04.240 --> 07:06.880
It's like we're three aliens that just came to this planet.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.680
I'm like, take me to your Halloween turkey.

07:09.680 --> 07:16.160
I'm, I'm willing to bet, question asker, that if this person has spent their entire life

07:16.160 --> 07:22.240
with their birthday, getting lumped in at the Christmas, you doing any amount to make

07:22.240 --> 07:24.880
them feel special will go such a long way.

07:25.520 --> 07:28.960
Just like completely, you taking them out to a nice dinner and making it all about them

07:29.680 --> 07:34.000
and not, because I bet the lumping is like mostly in like the present department.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.640
It's a birthday and Christmas.

07:36.640 --> 07:38.720
Good luck escaping it though.

07:38.720 --> 07:43.280
Like you can't get away from Christmas because it's everywhere.

07:43.280 --> 07:46.800
You can't pretend that it's not Christmas.

07:46.800 --> 07:51.360
I don't think to avoid lumping it, you have to pretend like Christmas doesn't exist.

07:51.360 --> 07:56.880
You just make it about the person, you know, because I would bet that's the problem is

07:56.880 --> 08:00.720
that it's hard to throw a party because everyone's throwing Christmas parties.

08:00.720 --> 08:06.160
It's hard to, you know, they probably got one gift for Christmas and birthday that probably

08:06.160 --> 08:10.720
the family came in and said, let's celebrate on the 23rd because the whole family will

08:10.720 --> 08:11.280
be in town.

08:11.280 --> 08:14.720
The problem is that it is about, the problem is it's already about a person stretching

08:14.720 --> 08:19.760
back to like already Christmas has exploded beyond its seams all the way back to like

08:19.760 --> 08:20.880
the middle of November.

08:20.880 --> 08:23.600
So the only person that's about it is Juicy Crust.

08:23.600 --> 08:26.480
Well, Juicy Crust has got to be pissed because no one celebrates his birthday.

08:26.480 --> 08:27.680
They just celebrate Christmas.

08:32.080 --> 08:37.520
You know, you could, we picked an arbitrary date for Jesus's birthday and that's bad

08:37.520 --> 08:44.640
luck for you, but what you could do is change your birthday, maybe step off my lord and

08:44.640 --> 08:46.880
savior, let him have his time.

08:46.880 --> 08:48.480
He was there first.

08:48.480 --> 08:53.120
He did get here first and he did have to sleep in a manger.

08:53.120 --> 08:53.840
It kind of sucks.

08:54.880 --> 08:57.280
I feel really bad for anybody in this situation.

08:57.280 --> 09:01.760
I've always secretly felt bad for you two because like my birthday's in April, so you

09:01.760 --> 09:03.040
get like a nice gap there.

09:03.040 --> 09:07.680
It's like a little stop gap of like, man, it sure has been a few months since I got some presents.

09:08.240 --> 09:09.280
And then I get them.

09:09.280 --> 09:11.040
For you guys, it's like, blah, blah, blah, blah.

09:11.040 --> 09:14.000
I mean, my birthday's about two months away from Christmas.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.360
Yeah, but the year, if you look at it, if you look at the year as a whole, like it's

09:17.360 --> 09:19.600
kind of, it's kind of top heavy for you two.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.600
And you don't have a lot to like space you out.

09:21.600 --> 09:25.600
Me, like I'm wandering through the desert and then I reach April, I'm like, oh, present

09:25.600 --> 09:25.840
oasis.

09:25.840 --> 09:26.960
What about Easter, dawg?

09:26.960 --> 09:28.480
You're just getting birthday baskets.

09:28.480 --> 09:32.400
Um, we don't really do that anymore.

09:32.960 --> 09:34.160
Kind of 30.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.120
Kind of like 30.

09:35.120 --> 09:36.400
We're all pretty much 30.

09:37.120 --> 09:38.960
So you guys don't get Easter baskets?

09:38.960 --> 09:40.400
I get Easter baskets.

09:40.400 --> 09:40.960
Do you really?

09:40.960 --> 09:43.200
What did you do to stay in good with that big bunny?

09:43.200 --> 09:45.760
Um, I married someone who still does Easter.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.840
So should I get back in it?

09:47.840 --> 09:52.160
Like you guys, I mean, all three of us are like super into holidays.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.240
I have like done fell off the Easter.

09:54.240 --> 09:56.960
You need to get back into Easter because here's the jam of Easter.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.080
Completely off topic.

09:58.080 --> 10:00.320
But Easter is just a just an excuse.

10:00.320 --> 10:03.520
It's like it's like Halloween for adults for lazy people.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.240
It's like trick or treat for lazy people because you don't have to go door to door.

10:06.240 --> 10:08.400
Someone just hands you a basket full of candy.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.440
Yeah, it says go to town.

10:10.320 --> 10:12.720
I'll take any excuse to eat a whole ham.

10:12.720 --> 10:17.600
I know I'm I'm I say next Easter we we appropriate that one too.

10:17.600 --> 10:18.080
Well, no.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.640
Here's the fucking problem though.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.920
I just talked to all this shit about how it sucks to have your birthday around Christmas.

10:25.920 --> 10:28.240
But my birthday is basically Easter.

10:28.240 --> 10:30.960
So if I start doing Easter, then I'm going to start feeling the redundancy.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.480
I'm gonna have to move my shit to like what?

10:32.480 --> 10:32.980
August?

10:34.240 --> 10:35.280
Move your shit to August.

10:35.280 --> 10:36.640
I that's what I would say.

10:36.640 --> 10:38.000
You run into flag day in August?

10:38.560 --> 10:41.360
Oh, we tear that shit up on flag day, though, in Austin.

10:41.360 --> 10:43.360
Yeah, is that pop off?

10:43.360 --> 10:44.720
It pops.

10:44.720 --> 10:45.280
Right pop.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.400
What's a month that has nothing in it?

10:50.480 --> 10:55.280
I mean, April occasionally you get out of but April Fools is still in April.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.160
This is pretty fun.

10:56.160 --> 11:00.000
I mean, I know maybe veterans memorials.

11:00.000 --> 11:00.880
One of those is in there.

11:01.600 --> 11:02.000
You know what?

11:02.000 --> 11:02.960
Nothing's in August.

11:03.760 --> 11:08.160
I really don't think August has much going on, except it has it has like a labor or a

11:08.160 --> 11:10.800
president's or a veterans or memorials.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.160
Those four are all pretty.

11:13.680 --> 11:16.160
I think they swap places actually secretly every year.

11:16.960 --> 11:20.880
Yeah, it's hard to people have to tell me I don't keep a very good you.

11:20.880 --> 11:21.680
Is there a June?

11:21.680 --> 11:22.400
What's in June?

11:24.400 --> 11:24.960
Arbor Day.

11:24.960 --> 11:25.520
Flag Day.

11:26.000 --> 11:26.640
How about a Yahoo?

11:26.640 --> 11:28.720
Because this bit is getting a little long in the tooth.

11:30.560 --> 11:33.440
This Yahoo was sent in by Elizabeth Scott.

11:33.440 --> 11:34.320
Thank you, Elizabeth.

11:34.320 --> 11:39.280
It's by Yahoo Answers user Celine Lola Pasman, who asks,

11:41.440 --> 11:43.840
Is it normal to hang out with your lunch lady?

11:45.280 --> 11:49.680
Okay, so I want to go to Warped Tour with my lunch lady.

11:49.680 --> 11:50.180
Whoa.

11:50.180 --> 11:54.260
But we're both still debating either or not.

11:54.260 --> 11:55.380
It's illegal.

11:55.380 --> 11:58.340
So is it additional additional details?

11:58.340 --> 12:00.020
She won't go to jail, will she?

12:00.020 --> 12:02.740
Because she listens to some really cool bands and stuff.

12:02.740 --> 12:05.700
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

12:06.740 --> 12:09.780
This is asked by someone named Selena, so I'm going to assume a girl.

12:09.780 --> 12:11.940
Celine Lola Pasman.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.300
Okay, young girl.

12:14.820 --> 12:15.620
Let's put her in.

12:15.620 --> 12:18.420
Let's not jump to let's not jump to conclusion.

12:18.420 --> 12:20.420
Middle school or high school?

12:21.700 --> 12:22.500
Definitely high school.

12:22.500 --> 12:23.940
Benefit of the doubt, high school.

12:23.940 --> 12:27.060
Okay, so let's say 16, 17 year old.

12:27.780 --> 12:28.280
Okay.

12:29.060 --> 12:30.420
Discovering your own body.

12:30.420 --> 12:31.460
Discovered her sexuality.

12:31.460 --> 12:32.260
Go on.

12:32.260 --> 12:33.380
Not in the context of this question.

12:33.380 --> 12:34.980
Just like, that's where she is.

12:34.980 --> 12:36.020
That's where she's at.

12:36.020 --> 12:36.900
That's just where she's at.

12:36.900 --> 12:37.300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:38.260 --> 12:40.500
But her lunch lady, super cool.

12:40.500 --> 12:41.460
Fucking super cool.

12:41.460 --> 12:45.700
Let's skew young on the lunch lady and say like 28, 29.

12:45.700 --> 12:48.660
Graduated from college with like a biochemistry degree,

12:48.660 --> 12:50.260
but then never really did anything with it.

12:50.260 --> 12:50.900
Never really.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.100
She's a lunch lady.

12:52.100 --> 12:52.600
Yeah.

12:52.980 --> 12:54.180
But she's still super cool.

12:54.180 --> 12:56.100
She's really into molecular gastronomy,

12:56.100 --> 12:59.060
but she doesn't really get a lot of time to like practice it at work.

12:59.060 --> 13:01.940
So she just wants to go to fucking warp tour.

13:01.940 --> 13:02.980
She does cool stuff too.

13:02.980 --> 13:05.380
Like she'll chop up the super donuts and like

13:05.380 --> 13:08.180
refry them with an injection of like cayenne pepper or something.

13:08.180 --> 13:09.780
Oh, that sounds delicious.

13:09.780 --> 13:14.180
So we're assuming that Celine is a super cool like 16, 17 year old.

13:14.180 --> 13:16.420
Really mature for her age, old soul.

13:16.420 --> 13:17.620
Yeah, definitely.

13:17.620 --> 13:20.100
There's something going on behind the eyes.

13:20.100 --> 13:23.060
That she's not your regular every day, 16, 17 year old.

13:23.940 --> 13:24.980
I'm going to say it's okay.

13:24.980 --> 13:26.580
I'm going to say I'd watch that movie.

13:28.260 --> 13:29.780
I think it would be a good movie.

13:30.500 --> 13:34.580
It's an unconventional relationship, but it's one that I can certainly celebrate.

13:34.580 --> 13:40.900
I do think though, you got to at some point in this film we've created in this fiction,

13:40.900 --> 13:45.940
I think, and I think our question asker here is going to run into the same thing.

13:45.940 --> 13:48.260
I think society is going to judge.

13:48.260 --> 13:53.060
They're not going to understand like we understand this very special relationship

13:53.060 --> 13:55.060
that we've constructed from whole cloth.

13:55.060 --> 14:00.420
They're not going to see Celine and Lunchy the way that we see them.

14:00.420 --> 14:02.980
Can we give her like, we've given her a fucking life.

14:02.980 --> 14:05.140
We just breathed life into this woman.

14:05.140 --> 14:07.140
Like the fucking hit film AI.

14:07.140 --> 14:08.900
Like we just created this person.

14:08.900 --> 14:10.900
Can we give her a God damn name?

14:10.900 --> 14:11.380
How about this?

14:11.380 --> 14:13.060
I feel like Lunch-a-rella.

14:13.060 --> 14:14.020
Okay, Lunch-o.

14:14.020 --> 14:14.900
How about just Lunch-o?

14:14.900 --> 14:17.140
If we're going to fucking be dicks about it, let's just do Lunch-o.

14:17.140 --> 14:18.420
How about Lunch-o McGee?

14:18.420 --> 14:19.540
All right, great.

14:19.540 --> 14:20.740
Man, really put our backs in that one.

14:20.740 --> 14:24.980
This story would be a lot of a hit film, a little film called The Man Without a Face.

14:24.980 --> 14:25.220
Okay.

14:27.380 --> 14:30.740
People didn't see what was going on between Mel Gibson and that kid.

14:31.540 --> 14:32.020
Let's play a game.

14:32.020 --> 14:34.340
That's because Mel Gibson didn't have a face, if I remember correctly.

14:36.740 --> 14:38.500
Didn't watch that one super close.

14:38.500 --> 14:44.180
No, I think he was just a skull, a talking skull, and the kid hung out with him.

14:44.180 --> 14:47.860
You shouldn't hang out with that talking skull man because I think he's a baby.

14:48.420 --> 14:49.380
What was the problem with him?

14:49.380 --> 14:52.420
So like his face had melted off while he was like helping Hitler or something.

14:52.420 --> 14:56.900
It was actually the first adaptation of Ghost Rider and they got it really wrong.

14:56.900 --> 14:58.580
They messed it up pretty bad.

14:58.580 --> 15:00.660
And the second adaptation of Monkeybone.

15:02.100 --> 15:02.660
Guys.

15:02.660 --> 15:04.900
Monkeybone face, leave that kid alone.

15:04.900 --> 15:06.980
Why can't Skeletor hang out with kids?

15:06.980 --> 15:11.140
Okay, here's some of the headliners at Warped Tour 2014.

15:11.140 --> 15:11.380
Okay.

15:12.420 --> 15:14.100
There's a Stray from the Path.

15:14.100 --> 15:14.820
Don't know who that is.

15:14.820 --> 15:15.860
Hardcore band.

15:15.860 --> 15:16.820
Tear Out the Heart.

15:16.820 --> 15:17.460
Don't know who that is.

15:17.460 --> 15:18.020
Metalcore.

15:18.820 --> 15:20.020
Plague Vendor.

15:20.020 --> 15:20.260
Nope.

15:21.380 --> 15:22.500
Teenage Bottle Rocket.

15:24.260 --> 15:25.140
Mixed Tapes.

15:25.140 --> 15:25.620
Made up.

15:26.900 --> 15:27.860
Skate Shoes.

15:27.860 --> 15:28.820
That's made up.

15:28.820 --> 15:30.260
That one is actually made up.

15:30.260 --> 15:30.580
Okay.

15:31.620 --> 15:33.620
There's the Proto Men, I actually have heard of.

15:33.620 --> 15:34.980
Okay, Proto Men, I know.

15:34.980 --> 15:35.860
Have heard of them.

15:35.860 --> 15:38.180
So one, I guess that'll be a pretty good show.

15:38.180 --> 15:39.300
What do you think Plague Vendors,

15:39.300 --> 15:40.820
what do you think a Plague Vendor show is like?

15:41.380 --> 15:44.020
It's like dudes in those like 17th century bird masks

15:44.020 --> 15:45.380
just vomiting into the crowd.

15:47.140 --> 15:49.860
Plus, here's the weird thing, it's funded by Andy Williams.

15:49.860 --> 15:52.580
So around this time of year, a lot of Christmas tunes.

15:52.580 --> 15:53.220
Interesting.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.420
It's what the audience demands.

15:54.420 --> 15:56.500
And they do it by a big pool of stagnant water.

15:57.860 --> 15:59.540
Everybody get your shots.

16:00.100 --> 16:04.420
No, but seriously, we're offering shots at the foot of the stage.

16:04.420 --> 16:07.220
Herd immunity is down in 2013.

16:08.740 --> 16:10.100
2013.

16:10.100 --> 16:12.180
But no, seriously, it's filthy.

16:12.180 --> 16:14.260
It's fucking really super gross.

16:14.260 --> 16:16.420
Clean your butts or else you'll get prostatitis

16:16.420 --> 16:19.940
like Griffin did at Bonnaroo 2006.

16:19.940 --> 16:20.900
Is Griffin here?

16:20.900 --> 16:21.540
Raise your hand, little buddy.

16:21.540 --> 16:22.260
Is Griffin here?

16:22.260 --> 16:23.060
Raise your hand.

16:23.060 --> 16:24.660
Why don't you stay seated, buddy?

16:27.140 --> 16:28.420
Guys, I just read.

16:28.420 --> 16:29.540
This one goes out to Griffin.

16:29.540 --> 16:32.660
It hurts to sit, it hurts to sit, it hurts to stand.

16:32.660 --> 16:35.780
And get somewhere in between and stay that way.

16:36.900 --> 16:41.140
Squad for your life, Plague Vendor's only hit.

16:43.220 --> 16:45.460
This is absolutely, by the way, one of those situations,

16:45.460 --> 16:46.660
I've kind of recognized them now,

16:46.660 --> 16:48.420
where as soon as the show goes live,

16:48.420 --> 16:51.460
someone will tweet at both us and Plague Vendor

16:51.460 --> 16:54.180
and say these fucking guys, these guys.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.940
They think you care about Griffin's butthole.

16:55.940 --> 16:56.900
Prove you do not.

16:56.900 --> 16:57.700
They might be awesome.

16:57.700 --> 16:59.860
If they have any cure, it's chronic.

16:59.860 --> 17:02.820
One of the guys who answers on this said that

17:02.820 --> 17:05.620
you can't cross state lines with someone.

17:05.620 --> 17:08.100
If they're over 18 and you're under 17,

17:08.100 --> 17:09.620
if you cross state lines with them,

17:09.620 --> 17:11.060
then you break the law.

17:11.700 --> 17:12.660
Is that fucking true?

17:12.660 --> 17:13.460
That can't be true.

17:13.460 --> 17:14.100
That can't be true.

17:14.100 --> 17:16.500
Maybe without parental permission.

17:16.500 --> 17:16.740
Yeah.

17:18.020 --> 17:21.460
But without permission, I feel like it wouldn't be okay

17:21.460 --> 17:23.220
for me to take a kid without permission

17:23.220 --> 17:24.900
so long as I stayed within Ohio.

17:25.460 --> 17:26.180
Yeah, yeah.

17:26.180 --> 17:28.260
He has to cross state lines, we can't do anything.

17:28.260 --> 17:29.620
Ohio's a big state though.

17:29.620 --> 17:32.020
Texas, we have a lot of flexibility there

17:32.020 --> 17:33.780
because I didn't take them with Northern Panhandle.

17:33.780 --> 17:35.300
They will never see their parents again,

17:35.300 --> 17:36.980
but I'm taking them to Warped Tour

17:36.980 --> 17:39.060
so it's totally fine, totally platonic.

17:39.060 --> 17:43.380
It's a super cool Celine-Luncho relationship.

17:43.380 --> 17:45.060
It's more of a mentorship.

17:45.060 --> 17:47.780
I'd watch that movie Tuesdays with Luncho

17:49.060 --> 17:51.300
if it was about Celine wants to go to Warped Tour

17:51.300 --> 17:52.740
but her parents are like, no, you're eight.

17:53.380 --> 17:56.420
And Luncho was like, no, get in my Toyota Corolla.

17:56.420 --> 17:56.980
We're going.

17:56.980 --> 17:59.540
And then it was like a road trip to Warped Tour

18:00.900 --> 18:02.260
but they couldn't cross state lines

18:02.260 --> 18:04.020
so they weren't able to make it to Warped Tour.

18:04.020 --> 18:06.100
So they had to stage their own Warped Tour

18:06.100 --> 18:07.300
at the local amphitheater.

18:09.540 --> 18:10.740
It's like a benefit show.

18:12.740 --> 18:14.180
It's just a big banner up there.

18:14.180 --> 18:18.660
It says like, let's get warped.

18:20.340 --> 18:22.980
The R is backwards, it's adorable.

18:23.540 --> 18:25.220
Hey, I got another question for you guys.

18:25.220 --> 18:25.940
Okay.

18:25.940 --> 18:27.860
I've been in a relationship for six years

18:27.860 --> 18:30.100
but we have never spent a Christmas together.

18:30.100 --> 18:31.540
We started dating in high school

18:31.540 --> 18:33.060
and I've always gone to our respective families

18:33.060 --> 18:34.180
homes for the holiday.

18:34.180 --> 18:36.340
We've continued to do so now that we've graduated.

18:36.340 --> 18:37.940
This has been fine but we really like to start

18:37.940 --> 18:39.780
spending this major holiday together

18:39.780 --> 18:41.540
and are struggling on the how.

18:41.540 --> 18:43.780
We live in Washington, her parents live in California,

18:43.780 --> 18:45.220
a minor in Oregon so splitting time

18:45.220 --> 18:46.980
or the holiday isn't an option.

18:46.980 --> 18:50.420
We aren't ready to have Christmas on our own

18:50.420 --> 18:52.580
so at some point one of us will be the child

18:52.580 --> 18:54.340
that didn't come home for Christmas that year.

18:54.340 --> 18:56.180
To add complications, her dad's birthday happens

18:56.180 --> 18:57.620
to fall on Christmas.

19:00.260 --> 19:01.940
Now that all of you are married,

19:01.940 --> 19:05.220
presumably splitting some holiday time between in-laws,

19:05.220 --> 19:07.700
how have you and your significant, et cetera, et cetera,

19:07.700 --> 19:10.660
candle nights as from stumped in Spokane?

19:12.260 --> 19:13.380
I mean, it's not an issue

19:13.380 --> 19:14.740
because we're all spending Christmas together.

19:15.300 --> 19:16.740
All spending like Christmas day together.

19:18.020 --> 19:21.540
The real answer, you have to get really stupid,

19:21.540 --> 19:25.380
creative and sacrifice, sacrifice.

19:26.740 --> 19:27.540
We don't have to do that

19:27.540 --> 19:31.060
because our family trust is bond and blood and love

19:31.060 --> 19:33.540
and trust and blood, you know what I mean?

19:33.540 --> 19:35.620
We're spending Christmas together in our hearts.

19:36.420 --> 19:38.340
Yeah, in our body because our hearts are in our bodies

19:38.340 --> 19:39.620
and our bodies are all gonna be together

19:39.620 --> 19:41.780
Christmas morning tearing open those packages.

19:41.780 --> 19:42.660
Even though our bodies will be far apart, Griffin,

19:43.380 --> 19:45.140
our souls will still call to each other.

19:46.500 --> 19:47.860
Well, December 25th I just told us

19:47.860 --> 19:48.740
we'll have to call each other

19:48.740 --> 19:50.500
because our voices came from across the room.

19:50.500 --> 19:51.780
Yeah, I'll see your face.

19:51.780 --> 19:53.780
Sometimes more orange rolls.

19:53.780 --> 19:55.300
Good morning, here's your Christmas kiss.

19:55.860 --> 19:57.860
Sometimes people love each other.

19:57.860 --> 19:58.420
I love you.

19:58.420 --> 19:59.380
You have to spend a little time apart.

19:59.380 --> 20:00.740
I can't wait to tell you I love you

20:00.740 --> 20:02.260
face-to-face on Christmas morning.

20:05.780 --> 20:06.660
Good news, you guys.

20:06.660 --> 20:07.540
Can't wait.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.820
I've hired a Travis impersonator

20:11.380 --> 20:13.220
to be there on Christmas with you.

20:13.220 --> 20:15.060
So there'll be two Travis's, that'll be fun.

20:15.060 --> 20:18.900
No, no, no.

20:18.900 --> 20:20.740
It's gonna be the best Christmas ever.

20:20.740 --> 20:24.100
My only wish was that we get all together,

20:24.100 --> 20:28.020
married finally in defiance of logic and God's will

20:28.740 --> 20:32.900
to just be, this goof is running a little long too.

20:33.460 --> 20:35.780
Travis is not gonna be with us on Christmas morning.

20:35.780 --> 20:36.820
This is how you explain it.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.020
No, well, okay, Griffin.

20:39.220 --> 20:40.580
That's what he says.

20:40.580 --> 20:41.860
But I've been watching a lot of ABC.

20:41.860 --> 20:43.700
Oh, what's that present behind?

20:43.700 --> 20:45.620
What's that present behind the desk?

20:45.620 --> 20:49.060
A lot of ABC family in the run-up to Candle Nights.

20:49.060 --> 20:54.260
And if I've learned anything from that series of films.

20:54.260 --> 20:56.660
You watched a movie with Joey Lawrence in it, didn't you?

20:56.660 --> 20:58.260
No, no, I watched an actual,

20:58.260 --> 21:00.020
this is an actual plot of a real movie

21:00.020 --> 21:01.220
called Holiday in Handcuffs

21:01.220 --> 21:03.860
that I only saw about 20 minutes of, but I got it.

21:03.860 --> 21:06.340
Melissa Joan Hart was a disgruntled waitress

21:06.340 --> 21:08.660
who was tired of not having a boyfriend for the holidays.

21:08.660 --> 21:11.140
So she kidnaps Mario Lopez.

21:11.140 --> 21:12.020
Fuck.

21:12.020 --> 21:14.020
Yeah, and takes her to her family home.

21:14.020 --> 21:15.380
Mary Kay Place is her mom.

21:16.820 --> 21:17.940
I didn't recognize the dad,

21:17.940 --> 21:21.700
but he is her prisoner for the holidays.

21:21.700 --> 21:22.660
Does she know him?

21:22.660 --> 21:25.700
Or is this like a fucking like random crime of passion?

21:25.700 --> 21:26.980
It's a random crime.

21:26.980 --> 21:28.100
She kidnaps him.

21:28.100 --> 21:29.700
She has crazy hair.

21:29.700 --> 21:33.060
And it's a very sort of Kathy Bates and Misery vibe.

21:37.060 --> 21:38.580
At the end of the movie though,

21:38.580 --> 21:39.700
Does they fall in love?

21:39.700 --> 21:42.020
Does Mil Lopez go,

21:42.660 --> 21:45.540
oh, I see now that you're a good person and I love you.

21:45.540 --> 21:47.220
Well, no, he doesn't see if she's a good person.

21:47.220 --> 21:48.980
She straightens her whack haircut

21:48.980 --> 21:51.140
and she's all that into him.

21:51.140 --> 21:55.220
He says, I really do love you

21:55.220 --> 21:56.340
and I'm glad that you kidnapped me.

21:56.340 --> 21:57.300
It's a Christmas miracle.

21:57.300 --> 21:58.900
She says, okay, I'm gonna take these handcuffs off

21:58.900 --> 21:59.540
so he can kiss.

21:59.540 --> 22:00.340
And he says, great.

22:00.340 --> 22:01.780
And she takes the handcuffs off

22:01.780 --> 22:03.860
and then he picks up the phone that's sitting next to her

22:03.860 --> 22:05.940
and hits her over the head with it and runs away.

22:05.940 --> 22:06.740
It says, not today.

22:07.380 --> 22:08.580
I'd watch that movie.

22:08.580 --> 22:10.740
I think the biggest fiction about that movie

22:10.740 --> 22:14.500
is that you actually legally cannot kidnap Mario Lopez.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.500
He's just happy to have something to do.

22:18.900 --> 22:19.380
What?

22:19.380 --> 22:20.900
Is there work there?

22:20.900 --> 22:21.700
Or kids?

22:21.700 --> 22:22.340
Are there gonna be kids?

22:22.340 --> 22:24.980
That's just cause he approaches everything as a gig.

22:26.260 --> 22:27.220
Everything.

22:27.220 --> 22:28.020
They got blankets?

22:29.540 --> 22:29.860
I'm in.

22:29.860 --> 22:32.980
My payment is a plate of biscuits and a warm blanket.

22:32.980 --> 22:34.020
Thank you very much.

22:35.460 --> 22:37.700
And then it actually says that in all of his contracts.

22:37.700 --> 22:40.580
If you leave more biscuits and a warm blanket

22:40.580 --> 22:42.500
out at night on Christmas Eve,

22:42.500 --> 22:44.340
Mario Lopez will literally be dead.

22:44.340 --> 22:45.380
You'll walk into the living room

22:45.380 --> 22:48.500
and he's watching a VHS tape of the Greg Louganis movie

22:48.500 --> 22:49.620
that he was in.

22:49.620 --> 22:50.100
Oh, come on.

22:50.100 --> 22:51.060
Why don't you sit down with me?

22:51.060 --> 22:51.860
There's room for two.

22:51.860 --> 22:54.660
It's in French and it's not subtitled.

22:54.660 --> 22:56.900
We're gonna shoot some intros and outros real quick.

22:56.900 --> 22:58.340
I just get this gig nailed.

22:58.980 --> 23:00.180
I brought my own gaffer.

23:00.180 --> 23:00.820
Is that cool?

23:02.500 --> 23:04.020
Well, you have fun on this show, but-

23:04.820 --> 23:05.940
Travis won't be with us.

23:05.940 --> 23:07.460
Travis definitely won't be.

23:07.460 --> 23:11.060
Okay, if you're looking for an excuse,

23:11.060 --> 23:12.580
there's two options here.

23:12.580 --> 23:15.220
If you're looking for an excuse to not have to travel

23:15.220 --> 23:17.460
and just want to spend some quality time

23:17.460 --> 23:18.660
with your significant other-

23:18.660 --> 23:19.540
That's not an option.

23:19.540 --> 23:20.660
That's not what he's asking for.

23:21.780 --> 23:23.460
That's the wisdom of Solomon.

23:23.460 --> 23:24.580
No Christmas!

23:24.580 --> 23:26.740
No, there's an easy answer.

23:27.380 --> 23:28.100
You have a kid.

23:29.300 --> 23:32.180
The kid's gonna get you out of at least two years of travel.

23:32.180 --> 23:37.060
They're not ready to spend Christmas in that fashion.

23:37.060 --> 23:38.740
No, they want to spend it with their families.

23:38.740 --> 23:40.580
It's just, how do they pick now?

23:40.580 --> 23:43.700
Well, what we're doing is alternating years

23:44.420 --> 23:45.700
as to whose place-

23:45.700 --> 23:50.420
So we're spending the 21st, 22nd, 23rd with the McElroys

23:50.420 --> 23:53.220
and then the 24th, 25th, 26th with the Wellmans.

23:53.220 --> 23:55.700
It would be nice if Griffin could have synced that up, but-

23:55.700 --> 23:56.420
Yeah, that would have been pretty nice.

23:56.420 --> 23:59.060
But then next year it'll flip

23:59.060 --> 24:01.940
and we'll be at our house for Christmas.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.620
Yeah, and Rachel and I do something kind of-

24:03.620 --> 24:05.140
This is not something that Justin has to deal with

24:05.140 --> 24:08.500
because all of those family units

24:08.500 --> 24:10.180
are in fairly immediate proximity,

24:10.180 --> 24:13.140
but Rachel and I just do Thanksgiving with her folks

24:13.140 --> 24:15.460
and Christmas with mine,

24:15.460 --> 24:19.300
and usually her folks come in a few days before Christmas

24:19.300 --> 24:20.420
and we'll hang out with them for a bit.

24:21.300 --> 24:24.900
Yeah, my situation has its own set of challenges.

24:26.020 --> 24:27.460
I've spent an hour of every Christmas-

24:27.460 --> 24:29.700
The murderous ghost that lives in the Smurls house.

24:30.420 --> 24:32.420
I spent an hour of every Christmas commuting,

24:32.420 --> 24:37.460
a Christmas day commuting for the past eight years, I think.

24:37.460 --> 24:39.220
That's been like Christmas for me.

24:40.260 --> 24:41.860
And it's hard.

24:41.860 --> 24:44.340
That's its own sort of thing

24:44.340 --> 24:46.580
because you are in town and you are so close.

24:47.140 --> 24:49.060
You always feel like you're disappointing people

24:49.060 --> 24:50.020
no matter where you're at.

24:51.780 --> 24:54.580
And then when you're driving on 52

24:54.580 --> 24:55.940
between Huntington and Ironton,

24:55.940 --> 24:57.460
you're disappointed the most important person

24:57.460 --> 25:00.500
is just yourself constantly every 30 seconds

25:00.500 --> 25:02.900
when you drive past someone who isn't Arby's.

25:02.900 --> 25:05.380
The problem is when it's Christmas day,

25:05.380 --> 25:08.340
there's never a good time to leave on Christmas day.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.540
There's never a point where everyone's like,

25:09.540 --> 25:11.380
I wish that guy would just get out of here.

25:11.380 --> 25:12.820
Has this been magical enough?

25:12.820 --> 25:14.900
Is the magic over, would you guys say?

25:14.900 --> 25:17.220
Our rule generally is you wait for the first person

25:17.220 --> 25:20.340
to fall asleep and then you have a pretty solid out.

25:23.300 --> 25:24.580
Why don't you just do it at your place?

25:24.580 --> 25:26.020
Just do like a super fucking-

25:26.020 --> 25:29.700
You guys would throw the sickest Christmas rager.

25:29.700 --> 25:32.020
You would tear the fucking city apart.

25:32.020 --> 25:35.060
You start at 6 a.m., you pop some eggs,

25:35.060 --> 25:37.780
you just don't stop until the Christmas tree burns down.

25:37.780 --> 25:38.740
That's what I'm saying.

25:38.740 --> 25:40.900
You have the power to cancel your own captivity

25:40.900 --> 25:43.540
in Christmas hell that you find yourself in.

25:43.540 --> 25:45.540
I know, but then it's like even sadder

25:45.540 --> 25:46.900
when you're like by yourself

25:46.900 --> 25:48.740
or just sitting there alone.

25:48.740 --> 25:52.260
No, you invite other people over, I guess.

25:52.260 --> 25:54.740
Justin, I make you this Christmas promise right now forever.

25:54.740 --> 25:55.460
You ready?

25:55.460 --> 25:56.020
Yeah.

25:56.020 --> 25:59.620
I will never pay for a hotel when I'm in Huntington.

25:59.620 --> 26:02.340
I will always, always, always stay at your house.

26:02.340 --> 26:05.620
This is a guarantee from me to you, brother to brother,

26:05.620 --> 26:08.420
I will never, ever not impose.

26:10.340 --> 26:11.300
That's touching, Griffin.

26:11.300 --> 26:13.140
You never have to worry about being alone

26:13.140 --> 26:16.020
when I'm in town just chilling on your couch

26:16.020 --> 26:19.140
eating the snacks that you've bought for me at Kroger's.

26:19.140 --> 26:20.900
Do you still like flip sides that-

26:20.900 --> 26:23.460
I'll eat the fuck out some flip sides.

26:23.460 --> 26:26.340
I've been working on a new technique where I eat one side.

26:26.340 --> 26:27.700
I'll eat like the pretzel side

26:27.700 --> 26:29.460
and then I'll get to that cracker side in a bit.

26:30.100 --> 26:32.580
Great, great, great, great, great, great, great.

26:32.580 --> 26:34.260
I will need two boxes of those.

26:34.260 --> 26:37.700
This is on my, this is on my waiver.

26:37.700 --> 26:38.500
Need it.

26:38.500 --> 26:39.860
Travis, are you staying with us at all

26:39.860 --> 26:41.060
or are you staying just in Ironton?

26:41.940 --> 26:44.020
Are we gonna discuss all of our travel plans, though?

26:44.020 --> 26:45.140
Yeah, why not?

26:45.140 --> 26:46.820
We're gonna do a night in Ironton,

26:46.820 --> 26:48.100
a night in Huntington.

26:49.540 --> 26:51.700
Bed situations get a little bit cramped.

26:51.700 --> 26:53.860
I hope that we don't-

26:53.860 --> 26:55.060
We've got our dog with us, too,

26:55.060 --> 26:56.980
but she'll probably stay at Dad and Carol's.

26:56.980 --> 26:58.900
If we stay together in Ironton,

26:58.900 --> 27:01.460
Rachel and I totally call the Austin Powers room

27:01.460 --> 27:02.740
that has the Austin Powers poster.

27:02.740 --> 27:04.020
Aw, you dick.

27:04.020 --> 27:05.220
Yeah, that one's mine.

27:06.340 --> 27:06.980
I need that.

27:07.860 --> 27:09.140
Let's get some money.

27:09.140 --> 27:22.260
You gotta have your family around, right?

27:22.260 --> 27:24.820
And you're not gonna have any idea what to do with them.

27:24.820 --> 27:25.780
Who knows?

27:25.780 --> 27:27.700
Who has any idea what to do with these people?

27:27.700 --> 27:30.740
They're in your home and you have no options.

27:30.740 --> 27:32.020
Well, we have an option for you.

27:32.020 --> 27:33.540
It's called Hulu Plus.

27:33.540 --> 27:34.820
You know Hulu.com.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.180
Everybody knows Hulu.com.

27:36.180 --> 27:39.380
But Hulu Plus lets you watch thousands

27:39.380 --> 27:41.060
of television programs and movies.

27:41.620 --> 27:43.140
You wanna do something with your family?

27:43.140 --> 27:45.940
How about you binge on Jimmy Kimmel Live

27:45.940 --> 27:47.540
or Sharp, maybe something more timely,

27:47.540 --> 27:48.580
actually, now that I think about it.

27:48.580 --> 27:50.580
Brand of Shark Tank or Scandal.

27:51.780 --> 27:53.220
And you can even get old stuff.

27:53.220 --> 27:54.740
Get some Doctor Who community.

27:55.380 --> 27:55.700
Get it.

27:56.260 --> 27:57.620
Get into it with your family.

27:58.180 --> 27:59.940
There's also original-

27:59.940 --> 28:00.820
There's originals.

28:02.020 --> 28:04.340
Unique shows that Hulu does,

28:04.340 --> 28:05.540
like The Wrong Man's.

28:05.540 --> 28:07.380
There's also a docu-series.

28:07.380 --> 28:09.140
Behind the Mask is the docu-series.

28:09.140 --> 28:10.980
And it takes you inside the world of sports mascots.

28:10.980 --> 28:13.780
Travis, you are dick deep in that show, right?

28:13.780 --> 28:14.500
Mm-hmm.

28:14.500 --> 28:15.140
Can't stop.

28:15.140 --> 28:15.860
Won't stop.

28:15.860 --> 28:17.300
Ad-free movies, stuff for kids.

28:17.300 --> 28:19.060
It's really good for the holidays.

28:19.060 --> 28:20.740
But here's the secret right now.

28:20.740 --> 28:22.820
We can get you through the holidays.

28:22.820 --> 28:24.260
Well, we can get you through Christmas

28:24.260 --> 28:28.660
with a two-week free trial to Hulu Plus.

28:28.660 --> 28:30.740
Normally it costs $7.99 a month.

28:30.740 --> 28:31.620
Let's be honest, it's $8.

28:32.420 --> 28:34.900
But you can get a two-week free trial

28:34.900 --> 28:39.380
using going to huluplus.com slash my brother right now.

28:39.380 --> 28:42.340
Get that free trial, get those TV shows,

28:42.340 --> 28:44.100
and get your family distracted

28:44.100 --> 28:46.500
so you can get out of the house and catch a smoke.

28:48.980 --> 28:50.100
Wait, what?

28:50.100 --> 28:50.740
For once.

28:53.700 --> 28:54.980
I have a call to action.

28:55.540 --> 28:59.140
I have a demand, actually.

28:59.140 --> 29:00.820
I'll just call it a demand.

29:00.820 --> 29:02.980
Check out Watch Out for Fireballs.

29:02.980 --> 29:07.060
Show, it's on iTunes, or you can also catch it on Duck Feed TV.

29:08.100 --> 29:10.180
And while you're at it, you can check out the other shows

29:10.180 --> 29:11.620
on Duck Feed TV.

29:11.620 --> 29:12.340
It's a podcast network.

29:12.340 --> 29:14.020
It's Duck Feed dot TV.

29:14.020 --> 29:14.660
Dot TV.

29:15.780 --> 29:17.220
It's a network, not unlike our own.

29:17.220 --> 29:19.940
Watch Out for Fireballs is a retro games podcast.

29:19.940 --> 29:21.860
It's hosted by Gary Butterfield,

29:22.820 --> 29:24.900
the Secret Service agent from the West Wing,

29:24.900 --> 29:26.740
and Cole Ross.

29:26.740 --> 29:28.260
Friend of the show, Cole Ross.

29:28.260 --> 29:30.180
Thanks, Cole Ross, for being a bud.

29:30.180 --> 29:33.460
Every episode is an in-depth exploration of an older game

29:33.460 --> 29:36.020
where they talk about why it succeeds or fails,

29:36.020 --> 29:39.540
and there's jokes and there's sketches and goofs and spoofs.

29:39.540 --> 29:41.540
And they have a really big back catalog,

29:41.540 --> 29:43.220
so I'm sure there's something in there

29:43.220 --> 29:46.100
that is about a game that you love.

29:46.100 --> 29:46.740
So check it out.

29:46.740 --> 29:48.660
It's great because you can hop in, hop out

29:48.660 --> 29:50.260
with just the episode interest you.

29:50.260 --> 29:52.180
It's an old nostalgic game for you.

29:52.180 --> 29:52.820
Check it out.

29:52.820 --> 29:53.860
Check out Duck Feed, too.

29:53.860 --> 29:56.500
They have a show all about the hit game Dark Souls,

29:56.500 --> 29:59.940
which is really good, and Justin never beat it

29:59.940 --> 30:02.500
because he's got a little boy's penis.

30:02.500 --> 30:04.340
He's got a little, like a baby,

30:04.900 --> 30:08.820
like a little, like a little, little boy's penis.

30:08.820 --> 30:12.500
I got a message for Henry, and it's from Aiden.

30:13.300 --> 30:14.660
And I, Aiden.

30:14.660 --> 30:15.460
Oh, you don't know.

30:16.420 --> 30:18.180
Why are you fucking pretending like you know?

30:18.180 --> 30:21.300
Beyond Two Souls ruined me on Aiden

30:21.300 --> 30:23.380
because that game pronounces it Aiden,

30:23.380 --> 30:24.980
and that's wrong, objectively.

30:24.980 --> 30:26.180
We all know that's wrong.

30:26.180 --> 30:28.180
Super French sensibilities.

30:28.180 --> 30:30.340
Anyway, happy birthday, Sweet Pea.

30:30.340 --> 30:31.460
You're the total package.

30:31.460 --> 30:35.300
Cute butt and a cute heart, XOXO.

30:35.300 --> 30:38.020
I'm willing to bet that Aiden has not seen Henry's heart.

30:38.820 --> 30:40.020
And let me also throw this out.

30:40.020 --> 30:42.420
I've been watching a lot of toddlers and heroes.

30:42.420 --> 30:43.940
That is not the complete package.

30:45.700 --> 30:46.900
What else does Aiden need?

30:47.460 --> 30:48.020
What?

30:48.020 --> 30:49.540
What else does Aiden need?

30:49.540 --> 30:51.620
You got to have poise.

30:51.620 --> 30:52.580
You got to have the talent.

30:52.580 --> 30:54.100
Got to see in their eyes because they

30:54.100 --> 30:55.460
can't be straining in their eyes.

30:55.460 --> 30:56.180
Yeah, right.

30:56.180 --> 30:56.580
Right?

30:56.580 --> 30:57.780
Listen, you can get up there.

30:57.780 --> 30:58.820
You can walk with confidence.

30:58.820 --> 31:01.460
But if your talent game is shit, get off the stage.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.540
Henry, when's the last time you updated your flippers?

31:03.540 --> 31:05.380
Because if you have some out of date flippers,

31:05.380 --> 31:07.380
you'll have like little weird teeth.

31:07.380 --> 31:08.340
Well, then here's the thing.

31:08.340 --> 31:10.980
You could have one of those homemade costumes, splurge,

31:10.980 --> 31:11.780
spend the money.

31:11.780 --> 31:12.580
It's worth it.

31:12.580 --> 31:12.820
It's totally worth it.

31:12.820 --> 31:13.540
You'll see the difference.

31:13.540 --> 31:14.420
You tell the difference.

31:14.420 --> 31:16.900
For God's sake, bring your own hair and makeup person.

31:16.900 --> 31:18.660
Don't trust the pageant organizers

31:18.660 --> 31:20.260
because you know they're getting kickbacks.

31:21.140 --> 31:23.060
And don't just have your mother do it.

31:23.060 --> 31:23.860
Hire someone.

31:23.860 --> 31:25.140
Hire a trainer.

31:25.140 --> 31:27.460
Get them in there every week.

31:27.460 --> 31:30.980
Speaking of splurging, Extreme Restraints

31:30.980 --> 31:32.820
is an adult superstore that you can

31:32.820 --> 31:36.820
go to to find all kinds of things that will make you splurge,

31:36.820 --> 31:38.820
both financially and-

31:38.820 --> 31:40.660
I actually just moved from a medium gauge

31:40.660 --> 31:41.860
to a heavy gauge splurger.

31:43.220 --> 31:45.060
Now, see, I was saying like-

31:45.060 --> 31:45.940
Oh, I got stretched out enough?

31:46.660 --> 31:48.100
Yeah, well, oh, no, no.

31:48.100 --> 31:49.860
When you talk about it like some sort of tool

31:49.860 --> 31:51.860
that you use to widen an orifice,

31:51.860 --> 31:55.540
you're ranging into like Sucian territory.

31:55.540 --> 31:58.980
I would not, could not with a splurge.

31:59.700 --> 32:00.900
But I'm working on it.

32:00.900 --> 32:02.660
But I'm trying, Dan.

32:04.340 --> 32:05.220
It takes time.

32:05.220 --> 32:06.500
It's a fibrous-

32:06.500 --> 32:07.940
It's a fibrous tissue.

32:07.940 --> 32:09.620
It doesn't like to be stretched.

32:11.060 --> 32:14.180
ExtremeRestraints.com is an adult superstore.

32:14.180 --> 32:19.060
You get toys, sexual in nature, books, DVDs.

32:19.060 --> 32:20.900
They've had over a half million customers

32:20.900 --> 32:21.380
and you can be half made in one.

32:21.380 --> 32:24.020
You can get Curious Games of Benjamin Button.

32:24.020 --> 32:24.820
You don't have that.

32:24.820 --> 32:26.180
All kinds of DVDs on there.

32:26.180 --> 32:27.860
Golden Girls complete box set.

32:28.900 --> 32:30.180
That might be somebody's fetish.

32:30.180 --> 32:30.740
I don't know.

32:30.740 --> 32:33.540
What's great is they cut in sex scenes

32:33.540 --> 32:35.780
into all the episodes, which is really nice.

32:35.780 --> 32:36.280
Worth it.

32:36.900 --> 32:37.220
Totally worth it.

32:37.220 --> 32:41.300
You can get a bargain deal at ExtremeRestraints.com.

32:42.420 --> 32:43.780
You can get some, like, what is it?

32:43.780 --> 32:44.900
20% off, I think?

32:45.540 --> 32:47.060
Something crazy like that.

32:47.060 --> 32:49.620
You gotta use the coupon code Sexabunga.

32:49.620 --> 32:51.940
I can't believe how long that one's fucking rolled.

32:51.940 --> 32:52.740
I know.

32:52.740 --> 32:55.380
Sexabunga is still legit.

32:55.380 --> 32:57.220
You can use it at ExtremeRestraints.com.

32:57.220 --> 32:59.060
Save yourself, I guess, 20%.

32:59.060 --> 33:00.020
It's a good amount.

33:00.020 --> 33:00.980
It's a healthy portion.

33:00.980 --> 33:01.540
It's a healthy portion.

33:01.540 --> 33:03.700
20% of you use it this week.

33:03.700 --> 33:06.020
It's 10% every week after this.

33:06.580 --> 33:07.380
So there you go.

33:07.380 --> 33:07.700
There it is.

33:07.700 --> 33:08.740
ExtremeRestraints.com.

33:08.740 --> 33:09.700
Place your orders now.

33:09.700 --> 33:10.980
Maybe you'll get in time for Christmas.

33:10.980 --> 33:13.620
I don't know what their shipping speed is.

33:15.380 --> 33:17.860
They don't indicate whether or not it'll arrive by Christmas.

33:17.860 --> 33:22.340
It'll come by Christmas, and so will you.

33:48.580 --> 33:51.460
But it's a pleasant, friendly vulgarity

33:51.460 --> 33:55.460
from two guys who went to a reasonably prestigious

33:55.460 --> 33:56.260
UC college.

33:57.060 --> 33:58.420
Why don't you try this show out now?

33:58.420 --> 34:00.100
Grab one with one of your favorite comedians,

34:00.100 --> 34:02.340
like Rob Corddry or Rob Delaney or whatever.

34:02.340 --> 34:04.740
Or somebody awesome that maybe you haven't heard of yet.

34:04.740 --> 34:08.420
Yeah, go to MaximumFun.org or your favorite podcasting app

34:08.420 --> 34:18.900
and download an episode of Jordan Jesse Go! now.

34:18.900 --> 34:19.940
I have so many.

34:20.740 --> 34:22.740
Thanks, everybody, who sent in in the Yahoos.

34:23.700 --> 34:26.180
This one, though, was sent in by Christopher Baker.

34:26.180 --> 34:26.820
Thanks, Chris.

34:26.820 --> 34:29.380
It's by Yahoo Answers User X, who asks,

34:32.100 --> 34:33.460
what happened to fashion?

34:33.460 --> 34:36.500
Firstly, if you get offended or butt-hurt by this question,

34:36.500 --> 34:37.220
don't answer.

34:38.180 --> 34:40.020
But my question is an honest one.

34:40.020 --> 34:41.860
What the hell happened to fashion?

34:41.860 --> 34:44.100
I mean, every time I turn on the TV or go out,

34:44.100 --> 34:45.700
people are dressed up awful.

34:45.700 --> 34:48.980
Men are wearing skinny jeans, ugly colored chinos,

34:48.980 --> 34:51.620
tacky V-necks, have the worst hairstyles,

34:51.620 --> 34:53.140
wearing awful-looking flannel shirts,

34:53.140 --> 34:55.060
and stupid-looking snapbacks.

34:55.060 --> 34:58.580
And to make this worse, it seems to be considered as cool and hip.

34:58.580 --> 35:00.020
What the F dash dash dash?

35:00.020 --> 35:02.420
I consider myself to be old-school, I mean, honestly.

35:02.420 --> 35:04.580
Look back at 2003 to 2004.

35:06.020 --> 35:08.420
Fashion was so cool and normal-looking.

35:08.420 --> 35:10.260
No one wore any of the above-listed clothes.

35:10.260 --> 35:14.100
Everyone wore normal-looking jeans, loose cargo pants,

35:14.100 --> 35:17.380
long sleeves, normal-looking baseball caps, et cetera.

35:18.180 --> 35:19.300
What the hell happened?

35:19.300 --> 35:21.460
Every time I go to a store online to find clothes,

35:21.460 --> 35:23.140
I can never find anything that I want.

35:23.140 --> 35:26.100
Every jeans or trousers in stores are skinny jeans.

35:26.100 --> 35:26.900
Just like me.

35:26.900 --> 35:30.820
Every jeans or trousers in stores are skinny jeans, chinos.

35:30.820 --> 35:31.620
Or they have-

35:31.620 --> 35:33.220
Where's the JNCO jeans?

35:33.220 --> 35:35.860
Or they have the, and then there's a hateful word here,

35:36.420 --> 35:38.500
that if I had seen when I was vetting this question,

35:38.500 --> 35:39.460
I wouldn't have read it anywhere,

35:39.460 --> 35:41.460
because I do not appreciate that.

35:41.460 --> 35:43.460
But they said a pejorative term

35:43.460 --> 35:45.620
about the tapered-leg looking effect.

35:47.220 --> 35:50.180
I mean, every men's trouser is now fricking tapered.

35:50.180 --> 35:53.540
I can never find a trouser with the standard leg cut even more.

35:53.540 --> 35:56.260
Even loose, regular jeans are all tapered.

35:56.260 --> 35:59.140
Or when looking for a hat, everything is a snapback.

35:59.140 --> 36:00.980
I hate these goofy-looking hats.

36:00.980 --> 36:03.060
I'm desperately looking for a normal hat,

36:03.060 --> 36:05.620
like these ones worn by Linkin Park in this video.

36:05.620 --> 36:09.220
And then there's a video of a Linkin Park concert.

36:09.220 --> 36:12.740
Two of the men are wearing hats.

36:12.740 --> 36:14.260
Regular hats, you would say?

36:14.260 --> 36:16.660
They're definitely not snapbacks.

36:16.660 --> 36:19.460
Now, it seems that people love to dress up in a bizarre manner,

36:19.460 --> 36:22.500
and even bands like Linkin Park enjoy the hipster trend.

36:22.500 --> 36:23.780
So what the hell happened?

36:23.780 --> 36:26.340
Anyone out there share the same feelings as me?

36:27.380 --> 36:28.180
Fuck.

36:29.860 --> 36:32.260
Even fucking Linkin Park has succumbed

36:32.260 --> 36:34.180
to the siren sound of a snapback hat.

36:34.180 --> 36:35.460
You bastion of fashions.

36:36.900 --> 36:37.540
Where?

36:37.540 --> 36:40.420
Those paragons, those fashionistas.

36:40.420 --> 36:41.460
Those men among men.

36:41.460 --> 36:42.500
Where is this guy shopping?

36:42.500 --> 36:44.900
The shining city on the Linkin Park hill.

36:44.900 --> 36:46.340
Hi, I'm Jesse Thorne.

36:46.340 --> 36:48.100
This week on Put This On,

36:48.100 --> 36:50.740
a whole episode dedicated to Linkin Park.

36:51.780 --> 36:52.820
Thanks for listening.

36:52.820 --> 36:54.980
Thanks for listening.

36:54.980 --> 36:55.860
Where are you going?

36:56.740 --> 36:57.780
Hey, come back.

36:57.780 --> 36:58.660
Oh my Jesus.

37:00.180 --> 37:03.700
Guys, I am fucking one step closer to the edge

37:03.700 --> 37:04.740
and I'm about to break.

37:05.380 --> 37:06.820
What happened to fashion?

37:07.540 --> 37:08.580
Real quick question.

37:08.580 --> 37:12.180
You remember the golden days in 2003-2004?

37:12.180 --> 37:15.860
Is 2003-2004 quote old school?

37:15.860 --> 37:18.580
That's when fashion made sense to him for a little while.

37:19.460 --> 37:21.860
How, okay, okay, fun quiz.

37:21.860 --> 37:24.260
Answer at the same time on three.

37:24.260 --> 37:24.580
Okay.

37:24.580 --> 37:25.700
How old is this dude?

37:26.340 --> 37:28.340
One, two, three.

37:28.980 --> 37:30.260
21.

37:30.260 --> 37:33.140
Okay, a lot of broad spectrum there.

37:33.140 --> 37:33.940
Broad spectrum.

37:34.660 --> 37:38.740
I don't understand where this guy is shopping

37:38.740 --> 37:40.580
or living or existing

37:40.580 --> 37:44.420
where he can't find literally everything in the world.

37:44.420 --> 37:45.060
What's great?

37:45.060 --> 37:47.220
Everything in the world is on sale.

37:47.220 --> 37:48.420
Just go to like,

37:48.420 --> 37:53.540
I bet there's a store called No Snapbacks and Regular Pants.

37:53.540 --> 37:54.100
Notate.com.

37:54.100 --> 37:55.380
Go to fucking TJ Maxx.

37:55.380 --> 37:57.140
Become a Maxinista.

37:57.140 --> 37:59.300
Get those, get those non-tabred jeans.

37:59.300 --> 38:01.620
So I get my non-tabred jeans, friendo.

38:02.500 --> 38:03.300
You're welcome.

38:03.300 --> 38:05.700
There's a little TJ Maxx tip from Trav to you.

38:06.340 --> 38:10.260
Do you guys know that in the UK it's called TK Maxx?

38:10.260 --> 38:11.700
As if we wouldn't notice.

38:11.700 --> 38:12.580
Is it really?

38:12.580 --> 38:13.620
Yeah, it's bizarre.

38:13.620 --> 38:14.340
I saw a commercial.

38:14.340 --> 38:16.020
It was like, it was really one of those,

38:16.660 --> 38:17.620
am I dreaming?

38:17.620 --> 38:21.060
Am I like in that half reality between wake and asleep?

38:21.060 --> 38:22.260
Let me ask you this question,

38:22.260 --> 38:23.700
or rather observation.

38:23.700 --> 38:25.780
I think my favorite thing about this question

38:26.340 --> 38:30.500
is the use of the word desperately in looking for hats

38:30.500 --> 38:34.260
because I can just picture this guy busting into like a Hollister.

38:34.260 --> 38:35.860
Be like, where are the hats?

38:35.860 --> 38:37.940
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, Scott.

38:38.740 --> 38:40.660
You don't understand.

38:40.660 --> 38:44.580
He's just, he's just knocking shelving over.

38:44.580 --> 38:46.660
Snapbacks, snapbacks, snapbacks.

38:46.660 --> 38:48.100
Lincoln Park, how could you?

38:49.460 --> 38:50.820
I thought that everybody shop for hats

38:50.820 --> 38:52.180
in the same way that I shop for hats,

38:52.180 --> 38:54.260
which is that you find the one hat

38:55.140 --> 38:58.580
and maybe in the universe that fits your weird head.

39:00.100 --> 39:03.620
The top of my head is like octagonal, basically.

39:03.620 --> 39:06.100
I've been wearing the same West Virginia Pumpkin Festival hat

39:06.100 --> 39:07.380
for the past like seven years

39:07.380 --> 39:08.500
because it fits my melon.

39:08.500 --> 39:09.380
Because it fits it.

39:10.100 --> 39:12.020
I didn't know that people had a choice in that matter.

39:12.020 --> 39:15.940
Um, there is a lot of agreement in the answers section of this question.

39:15.940 --> 39:19.380
A lot of people are totally on board with this, with this dude.

39:19.380 --> 39:22.740
One person calls him out for his homophobia, which yeah, fuck this guy.

39:22.740 --> 39:25.140
He doesn't deserve anybody's help in the first place

39:25.140 --> 39:26.260
because of his hate speech.

39:26.260 --> 39:29.380
But, um, but he has made some excellent points

39:29.380 --> 39:31.540
about how terrible fashion is nowadays.

39:31.540 --> 39:33.780
What happened to those loose fitting cargoes?

39:33.780 --> 39:37.060
Those loose fitting cargoes that looked so good on everyone

39:37.060 --> 39:38.980
on the last season of Dawson's Creek.

39:38.980 --> 39:41.220
Listen, not only up here, but some people

39:41.220 --> 39:42.900
up here put some pockets down here.

39:42.900 --> 39:44.420
How convenient.

39:44.420 --> 39:46.580
The closest I ever got to matching fashion

39:47.140 --> 39:50.980
is that one time I had a Hawaiian shirt.

39:50.980 --> 39:52.340
I still have it actually.

39:52.340 --> 39:57.300
And my wife informed me that it had once been worn by Pacey on Dawson's Creek.

39:57.300 --> 40:00.420
And that was the closest I got to really being fashionable.

40:01.780 --> 40:05.300
It was five years after the series ended, of course, but still.

40:05.300 --> 40:10.500
Um, I have to read this answer from somebody

40:10.500 --> 40:13.460
who has agreed with this person's assertion

40:15.780 --> 40:18.660
in, I would say, an unorthodox manner.

40:19.700 --> 40:22.980
He, I'm assuming, he or she responded.

40:24.980 --> 40:26.580
It's called cultural collapse.

40:27.860 --> 40:30.740
All cultures eventually collapse all in the same general manner

40:30.740 --> 40:32.020
and for the same general reasons.

40:32.020 --> 40:35.060
Symptoms of impending collapse include basic service jobs

40:35.060 --> 40:38.420
taken over by immigrants, increasing welfare roles,

40:38.420 --> 40:41.860
national defense given to mercenaries because citizens refuse to serve,

40:41.860 --> 40:45.300
debunking of national heroes in admiration of slobs instead,

40:45.300 --> 40:49.620
rejection of the dominant religion, morals, and all standards of excellence.

40:49.620 --> 40:51.940
First noticed in arts and then in all activities.

40:51.940 --> 40:54.100
The trigger for the final collapse is always random

40:54.100 --> 40:56.900
and always something that a healthy society could have handled.

40:56.900 --> 41:01.780
And he links to a website called comingdarkage.blogspot.com.

41:01.780 --> 41:03.700
So I think that this person,

41:05.060 --> 41:07.940
in agreeing with the fact that ginkgo jeans were pretty comfortable

41:07.940 --> 41:10.500
and, man, wouldn't it be great if ginkgo jeans were still around,

41:11.060 --> 41:13.540
may have lost his fucking gourd at some point.

41:13.540 --> 41:16.660
What I'd love to see is the Yahoo Answers question asker

41:16.660 --> 41:19.140
getting to that answer and be like, yeah, so many people are-

41:19.140 --> 41:19.620
Yeah.

41:19.620 --> 41:20.340
Whoa.

41:20.340 --> 41:21.460
Whoa. Hey, buddy.

41:21.460 --> 41:23.700
I was just saying I wanted a snapback hat.

41:24.580 --> 41:26.100
I hit a nerve here.

41:26.100 --> 41:28.980
I think America's doing pretty okay.

41:28.980 --> 41:30.820
Travis, you watched the movie Collapse.

41:30.820 --> 41:34.820
Is this a plot line when he's like, the old dude from that movie is like,

41:34.820 --> 41:36.980
oh, I know exactly what I'm talking about.

41:36.980 --> 41:40.100
Look, here's a graph and the graph says ginkgo jeans on it.

41:40.100 --> 41:41.620
And then it's just a line going down.

41:41.620 --> 41:44.020
So thanks, Obama, I guess.

41:44.020 --> 41:50.180
I enjoy the idea that the supposition that the collapse of society

41:50.180 --> 41:53.220
was not heralded by the existence of Linkin Park,

41:53.220 --> 41:55.540
which I probably could have gotten on board with,

41:55.540 --> 42:00.100
but with Linkin Park switching to snapbacks and hipster wear.

42:00.100 --> 42:01.620
That is the sign that we have-

42:01.620 --> 42:04.420
Well, that's what signaled the fall of Rome,

42:04.420 --> 42:08.900
is they went to wear the skinny fit togas as everybody knew.

42:09.780 --> 42:13.540
Is there any fucking band from that era that has kept it OG?

42:13.540 --> 42:16.820
And by OG, I mean, 2003-2004?

42:16.820 --> 42:19.540
I mean, Harry Connick Jr. has kept it pretty close to the vest.

42:19.540 --> 42:20.980
He's kept it pretty cool.

42:23.700 --> 42:25.940
I think Blink-182 still is-

42:25.940 --> 42:26.900
No, fuck those fools.

42:26.900 --> 42:29.540
Those fools went fucking corpo sellout bullshit.

42:29.540 --> 42:31.940
Is that why they're not invited back to Warped Tour anymore?

42:31.940 --> 42:33.940
I remember when those fucks used to show up at Warped Tour

42:33.940 --> 42:35.460
and they had those thermal shirts

42:35.460 --> 42:37.700
and they cut holes in them for their thumbs to come through.

42:37.700 --> 42:39.060
That was a cool fucking look.

42:39.060 --> 42:41.780
I still do that look, but out of necessity,

42:41.780 --> 42:43.620
because I just have a lot of holes in my shirt.

42:43.620 --> 42:45.060
And you get cold palms.

42:45.060 --> 42:45.380
By the way-

42:45.380 --> 42:46.340
I get the cold palms.

42:46.340 --> 42:48.340
Because I'm sure everyone was wondering,

42:48.340 --> 42:51.380
the last post on thecomingdarkage.blogspot.com

42:51.380 --> 42:54.580
was posted in 2004, so apparently they gave up.

42:54.580 --> 42:56.020
They gave it up.

42:56.020 --> 42:56.340
Fuck.

42:57.060 --> 42:58.740
Maybe they traded in their jinkos and they're like,

42:58.740 --> 43:00.660
no, it's time, this is a young man's game.

43:00.660 --> 43:02.420
Let me just throw this out real quick too.

43:02.420 --> 43:04.020
Abraham Lincoln Park.

43:04.020 --> 43:04.420
Go on.

43:05.540 --> 43:07.140
You just said a thing, it didn't really-

43:07.140 --> 43:09.700
I know, but it popped in my head like five minutes ago

43:09.700 --> 43:12.180
and I knew it wasn't gonna come up organically.

43:12.180 --> 43:13.540
Yeah, well there's a pretty good reason.

43:14.740 --> 43:17.700
That's like, you just wrote a sketch day,

43:17.700 --> 43:19.860
a series of sketches on Saturday Night Live.

43:19.860 --> 43:21.460
You don't take more than that sometimes.

43:21.460 --> 43:22.500
Can I read another Yahoo?

43:23.140 --> 43:23.540
Please.

43:24.500 --> 43:25.540
It's sent in by Steven.

43:25.540 --> 43:26.500
Emrick thanks Steven.

43:26.500 --> 43:27.860
It's by a Yahoo answers user.

43:27.860 --> 43:28.260
What?

43:28.260 --> 43:30.260
And then an emoticon that I don't know how to pronounce.

43:30.260 --> 43:34.740
And what asks, what do you like the most about Yahoo Answers?

43:35.940 --> 43:39.620
For me, for me, it helps me to spend my time.

43:39.620 --> 43:40.420
That was what?

43:40.420 --> 43:41.380
Answering not me.

43:41.380 --> 43:44.020
It helps me to spend my time?

43:44.020 --> 43:44.580
Mm-hmm.

43:45.140 --> 43:46.180
Oh, he's in prison.

43:46.900 --> 43:47.700
It's possible.

43:47.700 --> 43:49.460
What is in solitary confinement

43:49.460 --> 43:51.220
but somehow has gotten his hands on a tablet?

43:51.220 --> 43:54.420
Yahoo Answers is better about leaping to assumptions.

43:54.420 --> 43:54.980
Yeah.

43:54.980 --> 43:56.020
Okay.

43:56.020 --> 43:59.300
It helps him spend his time because he's trapped in a box.

43:59.300 --> 44:00.980
That the government put him in for crime.

44:00.980 --> 44:02.180
That's the government.

44:02.180 --> 44:04.500
He put him in a crime box for a thing he did.

44:07.140 --> 44:09.860
You can leave anytime you want, but there are bars.

44:09.860 --> 44:10.660
They're locked.

44:10.660 --> 44:11.380
And they're locked.

44:11.940 --> 44:15.220
They will meet with you periodically to see if you're cool to go.

44:15.220 --> 44:16.260
Are you cool to go?

44:16.260 --> 44:16.820
Not yet.

44:18.020 --> 44:23.700
Guys, someone answered the best thing about Yahoo is having contacts

44:23.700 --> 44:24.820
and making friends here.

44:24.820 --> 44:26.180
There's some nice people here.

44:26.820 --> 44:27.860
There's some trolls too.

44:27.860 --> 44:28.900
There's some trolls too.

44:32.020 --> 44:36.420
What kind of lasting relationship begins with,

44:36.420 --> 44:39.140
help, my cat's on fire and it's in my butt and I'm drunk.

44:40.500 --> 44:41.220
And I'm 12.

44:41.220 --> 44:42.660
To be fair, that's the time of Teresa.

44:42.660 --> 44:43.620
I'm also 12.

44:45.780 --> 44:48.340
Guys, I like, if you make that joke,

44:48.340 --> 44:50.180
but if someone helped you out of that old dickament,

44:50.180 --> 44:52.980
then I think you would owe them a debt of gratitude

44:52.980 --> 44:53.940
and you would appreciate them.

44:53.940 --> 44:55.140
If someone helped you out of that

44:55.140 --> 44:56.660
and they were able to keep it a secret,

44:56.660 --> 44:58.100
you'd owe them a life debt.

44:58.100 --> 44:59.140
You'd have to follow them around.

44:59.140 --> 45:02.660
Why don't they, it's like a mob thing

45:03.540 --> 45:05.700
where instead of like asking for advice,

45:05.700 --> 45:06.820
you ask for a favor,

45:06.820 --> 45:09.860
but someday Yahoo Answers will contact you

45:10.420 --> 45:12.340
and they'll need you to do them a favor

45:12.340 --> 45:13.380
and you can't say no.

45:13.380 --> 45:14.980
Sort of like pay it backward.

45:14.980 --> 45:16.100
Yeah, pay it backward.

45:18.500 --> 45:20.500
You know, I would be on this,

45:20.500 --> 45:23.620
on board with like goofing about all these people

45:23.620 --> 45:25.380
probably haven't made any long lasting friendships

45:25.380 --> 45:26.180
through Yahoo Answers,

45:26.180 --> 45:28.340
but I watched this Second Life documentary

45:29.060 --> 45:32.500
where like married people like swinging with each other

45:32.500 --> 45:34.900
and like going to conventions in Las Vegas

45:34.900 --> 45:38.740
for like people that they run Second Life businesses with online

45:38.740 --> 45:41.300
and like anything's fucking possible.

45:41.300 --> 45:46.260
There probably is a Yahoo Answers baby out there.

45:48.100 --> 45:49.540
I mean, it's not sad, it's fucking beautiful.

45:49.540 --> 45:51.060
Who are we to cast dispersions?

45:51.860 --> 45:52.660
I just hope it's one of the good ones.

45:52.660 --> 45:53.860
People have given us so much

45:53.860 --> 45:55.060
and we've given them nothing.

45:55.060 --> 45:56.740
We've given them literally nothing.

45:56.740 --> 45:58.980
I'm gonna fucking start a Yahoo Answers account.

45:58.980 --> 46:00.180
That's my New Year's resolution.

46:00.180 --> 46:01.860
I'm starting a Yahoo Answers account.

46:01.860 --> 46:03.140
I'm gonna get active in that community.

46:03.140 --> 46:05.460
I'm gonna fucking do a thousand hours community service.

46:05.460 --> 46:06.580
I'm gonna get my hands dirty.

46:09.860 --> 46:13.380
You know, the catch 22 of the nature of our business

46:13.380 --> 46:16.100
is that if we were to honest to God,

46:16.100 --> 46:17.860
answer and fix all of these,

46:17.860 --> 46:20.180
if we were to be the Yahoo Answers superheroes

46:20.180 --> 46:21.140
that didn't make fun,

46:21.140 --> 46:24.180
but instead answered earnestly and honestly,

46:24.180 --> 46:25.860
we put ourselves out of a job.

46:25.860 --> 46:27.540
Cause you think we could be the change

46:27.540 --> 46:28.500
that we want to see in the world

46:28.500 --> 46:30.020
or in this case that we don't actually want to see.

46:30.020 --> 46:31.140
We rippled through and instead of these,

46:31.140 --> 46:33.540
we were like, yeah, put a pizza crust in your butt.

46:33.540 --> 46:35.220
If we went through and said, oh, okay, you want to wait,

46:35.220 --> 46:36.740
that's how you do it, you do it like this.

46:36.740 --> 46:39.700
Or we would probably tell them not to do that, Travis.

46:39.700 --> 46:41.460
We wouldn't give them detailed instructions

46:41.460 --> 46:42.260
on the best way to put pizza in your butt.

46:42.260 --> 46:44.020
No, no, no, I'm saying that that's an,

46:44.020 --> 46:45.540
give them alternate ways to give back their pizza crust.

46:45.540 --> 46:46.820
How would you even know the best way

46:46.820 --> 46:48.580
to put pizza in your butt, Travis?

46:48.580 --> 46:51.300
Cause you can't go, that's another catch.

46:51.300 --> 46:54.260
Or if you remember, the question wasn't how best to do it.

46:54.260 --> 46:56.340
It was other ways to get back at their parent

46:56.340 --> 46:58.020
without putting pizza crust in their butt.

46:58.020 --> 46:58.900
What I'm saying though,

46:58.900 --> 47:01.140
is we have built another catch 22 in there.

47:01.140 --> 47:03.220
Is that where do you look

47:03.220 --> 47:06.500
for how to best put pizza in your butt, but Yahoo Answers.

47:06.500 --> 47:09.620
It's a fucking time paradox.

47:09.620 --> 47:11.940
You can't get that information from Yahoo Answers

47:11.940 --> 47:14.100
to give it to someone on Yahoo Answers.

47:14.100 --> 47:15.860
This is the thing about Yahoo Answers

47:15.860 --> 47:18.980
that you don't realize until you really get deep into it

47:18.980 --> 47:19.620
and think about it.

47:19.620 --> 47:23.540
And this is what those people over at midnight

47:23.540 --> 47:26.100
will never understand about Yahoo Answers,

47:27.140 --> 47:32.980
is that it is only an appropriate place for questions.

47:32.980 --> 47:34.900
They're either questions that are so weird

47:34.900 --> 47:36.100
Google can't answer them,

47:36.740 --> 47:40.100
or people that are so dumb they can't Google.

47:40.100 --> 47:43.620
So that's the balance the Yahoo Answers strikes.

47:43.620 --> 47:45.540
It's right there in the middle

47:45.540 --> 47:47.700
between the bizarre and the stupid.

47:47.700 --> 47:50.500
It has to be a one in a million problem for there not to be,

47:50.500 --> 47:51.780
because think about this for a second.

47:52.340 --> 47:54.100
If you Google any of these questions,

47:54.100 --> 47:55.460
which I assume you would do

47:55.460 --> 47:57.460
before you put yourself out there to strangers.

47:57.460 --> 47:59.780
If you Google any of these questions

47:59.780 --> 48:02.740
and someone has already asked it on Yahoo Answers,

48:02.740 --> 48:04.580
then the answer you seek will be there.

48:04.580 --> 48:11.300
So QED, you cannot be the first person in the world

48:11.300 --> 48:14.500
to have this problem for it to appear on Yahoo Answers.

48:14.500 --> 48:16.900
That's how unique the situation has to be.

48:16.900 --> 48:19.620
This seems like a great money-making opportunity, doesn't it?

48:19.620 --> 48:22.420
Like if I do that and the top answer is Yahoo Answers,

48:22.420 --> 48:24.420
then I will know that this is knowledge.

48:24.420 --> 48:26.740
This is information that literally doesn't exist in the world.

48:26.740 --> 48:28.740
I can breathe more knowledge into the world,

48:28.740 --> 48:30.260
like Albert fucking Einstein.

48:30.260 --> 48:32.660
And also I can go to godaddy.com

48:32.660 --> 48:35.060
and I can get the domain pizzabutts.org.

48:35.060 --> 48:35.700
Uh-huh.

48:35.700 --> 48:38.260
Or I mean, let's make it more descriptive,

48:38.260 --> 48:39.220
bestpizzabuts.org.

48:39.220 --> 48:40.660
Bestpizzabuts.org.

48:42.100 --> 48:44.020
Don't go to pizzabutts.org.

48:44.020 --> 48:46.260
Their answers are unsatisfactory.

48:46.260 --> 48:47.380
They're gonna try the rest.

48:47.380 --> 48:49.780
Now try the best way to put pizza crust in your mouth.

48:49.780 --> 48:52.420
Our patented technique, you can tell it's patented

48:52.420 --> 48:53.540
because butts is with a Z.

48:55.220 --> 48:56.580
With the spread and bend.

48:57.620 --> 48:59.540
It's funny because I feel about Yahoo Answers

48:59.540 --> 49:02.340
the same way you feel about that one friend you've got

49:02.340 --> 49:04.260
where it's like, you're okay to make fun of him,

49:04.260 --> 49:05.620
but as soon as anyone else does it-

49:05.620 --> 49:06.900
I'll fucking bite your fingers off

49:06.900 --> 49:08.260
so you can't internet anymore.

49:08.260 --> 49:10.260
It's like, listen, I appreciate Yahoo Answers

49:10.260 --> 49:16.340
on a non-ironic deep level that you will never understand.

49:16.340 --> 49:18.100
So thanks so much for listening

49:18.100 --> 49:20.180
to our Yahoo Answers tribute episode

49:20.180 --> 49:21.540
of My Brother, My Brother Me.

49:21.540 --> 49:22.180
My Brother, My Brother Me goes back.

49:22.180 --> 49:23.380
It's a great service.

49:24.100 --> 49:26.820
If Marissa Mayer puts her fucking fingers on it,

49:26.820 --> 49:27.700
is that the Yahoo lady?

49:28.580 --> 49:29.380
I don't know.

49:29.380 --> 49:31.780
I know that I'm serious about Chris Hardwick and Midnight.

49:32.420 --> 49:34.340
They're chomping on flavor and I'm fine with it

49:34.340 --> 49:35.540
because it's great flavor

49:35.540 --> 49:36.980
and I think there's enough flavor for everybody.

49:36.980 --> 49:38.500
There is plenty of flavor.

49:38.500 --> 49:42.260
Get a, so thank you for listening to our program.

49:42.260 --> 49:44.660
Thank you to people who have been tweeting about it

49:44.660 --> 49:51.300
like Church's Wife, Mbittle, Usman, Alex, Two Alexes,

49:51.300 --> 49:55.380
Gaston Tercero, Tercero, yeah, I'm gonna go with Tercero,

49:56.100 --> 50:00.660
Jan Villarosa at Garden, BradyBinitBugs, Emma Elaine,

50:00.660 --> 50:03.780
13 Scarecrows, Sam Houston, Patrick B. Foss,

50:04.420 --> 50:07.380
Josh, Kevin Locke, so many others.

50:07.380 --> 50:09.540
We sure appreciate it.

50:09.540 --> 50:12.980
If you wanna share a link to the show to get people started,

50:12.980 --> 50:16.100
a great option is bit.ly forward slash mbnbam2013.

50:16.100 --> 50:19.540
That's our new sampler for this year.

50:19.540 --> 50:21.700
Guys, how about an apology?

50:22.580 --> 50:23.940
Yeah, quick apology.

50:23.940 --> 50:29.060
Very special apology to our friend and old listener Maureen

50:29.060 --> 50:33.460
who went through the trouble of giving us money

50:33.460 --> 50:37.220
for a MoneyZone spot that we did a pretty bad job with

50:37.220 --> 50:38.660
with all things considered.

50:38.660 --> 50:39.620
We really blew it.

50:39.620 --> 50:40.740
We really blew it.

50:40.740 --> 50:43.060
It was a happy birthday wish to Michelle,

50:43.060 --> 50:45.940
which I guess redo, happy birthday, Michelle.

50:45.940 --> 50:51.700
The offending, I think, portion was that she called her love

50:51.700 --> 50:54.020
burrito and I said that was gross.

50:54.020 --> 50:55.380
And I made fun of kale, which I feel awful about.

50:55.380 --> 50:56.900
And you made fun of kale.

50:56.900 --> 51:02.900
And I think that I wasn't saying that human love

51:02.900 --> 51:06.740
between two people is gross because I just got married.

51:06.740 --> 51:08.020
I'm obviously on that team.

51:08.580 --> 51:09.700
I thought when you said-

51:09.700 --> 51:12.420
I was saying, ooh, cause I was picturing a giant burrito-

51:12.420 --> 51:13.540
That you have sex with.

51:13.540 --> 51:15.300
Family double dare style.

51:15.300 --> 51:16.260
Oh, oh, oh.

51:16.260 --> 51:17.860
I was thinking of a burrito that you have sex with

51:17.860 --> 51:20.900
and immediately the logistics of that entered my mind.

51:20.900 --> 51:23.300
And within a split second, I thought after a month,

51:23.300 --> 51:24.820
that burrito has got to go.

51:25.860 --> 51:27.860
But I could understand how it could come off

51:27.860 --> 51:29.220
as a condemnation.

51:29.220 --> 51:31.380
So we done fucked that bit up.

51:32.260 --> 51:33.860
So apologies to Maureen.

51:33.860 --> 51:35.300
Happy birthday to Michelle.

51:35.300 --> 51:36.740
We'll try to get it together.

51:36.740 --> 51:37.380
I will not-

51:37.380 --> 51:38.420
Michelle, we love you both.

51:38.420 --> 51:39.540
Thank you for supporting the show.

51:39.540 --> 51:40.900
We're sorry that we made you sad.

51:40.900 --> 51:44.180
I will not do songs though, because I'm not a whore.

51:44.180 --> 51:46.660
I'm not a musical whore like Linkin Park.

51:46.660 --> 51:47.780
If you want to take a shot-

51:48.820 --> 51:50.580
If you want to throw your hat in the ring,

51:51.140 --> 51:52.740
if you want to spin the wheel.

51:53.380 --> 51:56.100
Go to maximumfun.org slash Jumbotron

51:56.100 --> 51:57.700
and get something special for somebody

51:57.700 --> 52:00.180
or maybe mess things up.

52:00.180 --> 52:01.700
Maybe we'll just do it really bad.

52:01.700 --> 52:02.420
But then you'll get-

52:03.060 --> 52:04.740
What's rarer than a Money Zone spot?

52:04.740 --> 52:05.700
An apology.

52:05.700 --> 52:06.980
You can't pay for that.

52:06.980 --> 52:08.820
I don't know that we've apologized before,

52:08.820 --> 52:10.340
except maybe to jugglers and furries.

52:11.140 --> 52:12.900
No, we didn't even apologize to jugglers.

52:12.900 --> 52:13.940
We stuck by those guns.

52:14.580 --> 52:16.180
Griffin, do you want to thank John Roderick

52:16.180 --> 52:17.060
and the Long Winters for you-

52:17.060 --> 52:17.700
John Jondrick?

52:18.820 --> 52:20.420
I want to thank John Jondrick and the Jondricks.

52:20.420 --> 52:22.100
I'm Ron Jondrick.

52:22.100 --> 52:24.740
This is my band, Dong Winters.

52:25.300 --> 52:28.420
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

52:28.420 --> 52:29.620
for the use of our theme song,

52:29.620 --> 52:30.820
It's a Departure, off the album,

52:30.820 --> 52:31.780
Putting the Days to Bed.

52:31.780 --> 52:33.700
You know what, Beyoncé just secretly released an album.

52:33.700 --> 52:35.540
If you guys could do that shit,

52:36.180 --> 52:37.460
if you guys could do that shit,

52:37.460 --> 52:39.540
it would be a legit Candlelight's Miracle.

52:39.540 --> 52:41.140
You could release it on our show.

52:41.140 --> 52:42.340
People would tune in,

52:42.340 --> 52:45.060
they'd hear the disclaimer at the beginning,

52:45.060 --> 52:45.540
and what's that?

52:45.540 --> 52:47.620
Just an hour of Long Winters.

52:47.620 --> 52:49.380
Hey, this disclaimer sure is going a while.

52:49.380 --> 52:50.340
And then there's another song,

52:50.340 --> 52:52.180
and another, and another, and another.

52:53.060 --> 52:56.180
We're not saying that it's probably not the broadest way

52:56.180 --> 52:57.780
to distribute your music.

52:57.780 --> 52:59.460
But it does get us out of a week of work.

52:59.460 --> 53:00.260
That's what I'm saying.

53:00.260 --> 53:01.700
It does get us out of a week of work.

53:01.700 --> 53:02.740
That is true.

53:02.740 --> 53:03.540
We do love that.

53:04.340 --> 53:06.580
Oh, and make sure that you check out Hulu Plus

53:06.580 --> 53:08.660
if you haven't, I assume that you already have,

53:08.660 --> 53:09.860
because everybody has.

53:09.860 --> 53:12.580
But if you haven't, you can get it on your Xbox,

53:12.580 --> 53:15.460
your iPad, your Samsung tablet, whatever,

53:15.460 --> 53:18.020
and check out all of their awesome shows

53:18.020 --> 53:20.100
and their original shows.

53:20.100 --> 53:21.700
You get an extended free trial

53:21.700 --> 53:24.500
by going to huluplus.com slash my brother.

53:24.500 --> 53:25.220
All one word.

53:26.500 --> 53:27.700
Check out Almost Human.

53:27.700 --> 53:28.580
I've been jamming on it.

53:28.580 --> 53:29.060
It's really good.

53:29.060 --> 53:30.020
Is it good?

53:30.020 --> 53:30.820
It is.

53:30.820 --> 53:31.460
I was wondering about it.

53:31.460 --> 53:34.340
I turned it on on a whim, and it's really good.

53:34.340 --> 53:34.980
Is it?

53:34.980 --> 53:38.740
So do a pros, cons, comparison

53:38.740 --> 53:40.980
with Almost Human and Little Wonders go.

53:43.220 --> 53:43.700
That's hard.

53:43.700 --> 53:45.380
I can do it with Not Quite Human.

53:45.380 --> 53:46.500
Nope, that's not what I wanted.

53:47.220 --> 53:48.340
It's not what I wanted, is it?

53:48.340 --> 53:49.380
One of the Little Wonders, didn't I?

53:49.380 --> 53:50.980
It's not nearly as erotic.

53:50.980 --> 53:51.380
Okay.

53:51.380 --> 53:52.020
Oh, God.

53:52.580 --> 53:57.220
This final Yahoo answer is sent in by Sam Grub.

53:57.220 --> 54:00.180
Thank you, Sam.

54:00.180 --> 54:01.620
I guess before we go, please send in

54:01.620 --> 54:02.500
Candle Knight's questions.

54:03.060 --> 54:03.380
Oh, yeah.

54:03.380 --> 54:03.780
You didn't ask.

54:04.740 --> 54:06.820
And make sure you listen to it with a loved one

54:06.820 --> 54:09.140
who maybe has never listened to the show before.

54:09.140 --> 54:10.820
That's your Candle Knight's present to us.

54:10.820 --> 54:11.620
It'll be clean.

54:11.620 --> 54:13.780
Please warn them that it's not usually.

54:13.780 --> 54:14.580
All right.

54:14.580 --> 54:15.620
This one is sent in by Sam Grub.

54:15.620 --> 54:16.180
Thanks, Sam.

54:16.180 --> 54:18.580
It's by Yahoo answer user Mandy, who asks,

54:19.940 --> 54:21.380
what are dogs made out of?

54:23.380 --> 54:24.740
I'm Justin McElroy.

54:24.740 --> 54:25.700
I'm Travis McElroy.

54:25.700 --> 54:26.900
I'm Griffin McElroy.

54:26.900 --> 54:27.940
They're my brother, my brother and me.

54:27.940 --> 54:28.900
Kiss your dad.

54:28.900 --> 54:29.940
Square on the lips.

54:47.300 --> 54:49.220
Maximumfun.org.

54:49.220 --> 54:50.260
Comedy and culture.

Artist owned.

54:51.380 --> 54:52.420
Listener supported.

54:53.060 --> 54:53.940
This is Biz.

54:53.940 --> 54:54.820
This is Teresa.

54:54.820 --> 54:57.060
We host a show called One Bad Mother.

54:57.060 --> 54:59.220
We're a comedy podcast about parenting.

54:59.220 --> 55:01.620
Not a parenting podcast.

55:01.620 --> 55:03.940
And for some reason, we seem to be most popular

55:03.940 --> 55:06.260
among single dudes with no kids.

55:06.260 --> 55:07.220
Weird.

55:07.220 --> 55:08.900
The only advice you'll get from us

55:08.900 --> 55:11.940
is when we tell you to stop feeling like a s***

55:11.940 --> 55:12.980
for being a mom.

55:12.980 --> 55:13.700
Or a dad.

55:13.700 --> 55:16.020
Or, you know, a single person with no children.
