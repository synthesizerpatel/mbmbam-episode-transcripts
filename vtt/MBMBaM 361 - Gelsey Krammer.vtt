00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:46.960
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the

00:46.960 --> 00:51.600
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis

00:51.600 --> 00:55.600
McElroy. I almost said youngest brother. What? That's incorrect. You want to trade this time?

00:55.600 --> 01:02.800
I don't know. Let's try it out. Justin, take it from the top. Okay. Hello everybody,

01:02.800 --> 01:07.200
my brother, my brother, and me, advice show. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your

01:07.200 --> 01:17.040
middle brother, Griffin McElroy. I'm your youngest. No, fuck, god damn. Come on, sell it. I'm your

01:17.040 --> 01:23.840
youngest brother, Travis McElroy. That's right, put that fucking diaper on. So this is my brother,

01:23.840 --> 01:28.240
my brother, me, an advice show for the modern era, like I said. I am actually the oldest one,

01:28.240 --> 01:36.160
and the rest of it is confusing. But I've been working on a personalized license plate. I was

01:36.160 --> 01:43.120
on the can earlier today, and I thought, I'm going to see what I could do, what kind of damage I could

01:43.120 --> 01:50.880
do here at the West Virginia WV, because they don't only let you search- Did you say West Virginia WV?

01:50.880 --> 01:57.040
The West Virginia DMV, sorry. They don't only let you search for available plates. They actually

01:57.040 --> 02:02.800
generate the plate so you could kind of see it and visualize it. It's kind of the secret. Once

02:02.800 --> 02:06.560
you type it in, you're already three-fourths of the way there, because that's the secret.

02:06.560 --> 02:10.720
That's how they close the sale. They let you see it, and you're like, well, I can't not do it. Now

02:10.720 --> 02:16.080
they went to all the trouble of generating this image. So the first one I tried, and it was

02:16.080 --> 02:25.280
available, and by that point I was fucking hooked, was Mambo No. 5. Mambo No. 5. No, in this case,

02:25.280 --> 02:30.400
is a shortened version of number. I saw you toot this image, and I thought you had misspelled

02:30.400 --> 02:36.160
MBMBAM really bad, but no, it's Mambo No. 5, like the Lubega song. Yeah, so I was thinking

02:36.160 --> 02:42.240
about that, and thinking about how very good of a license plate that would be. And it is a very

02:42.240 --> 02:48.080
good license plate. Very funny. If I saw that on a... You'd get stoked, right? I would get pretty

02:48.080 --> 02:52.160
stoked, and I'd roll down my window, and I'd make the Grey Poupon joke, and then I'd ask him,

02:52.160 --> 02:57.840
are you just cranking baga 24-sev? And the answer to that would be yes. Well, hold on. If you saw

02:57.840 --> 03:03.440
the license plate Mambo No. 5, what percentage of chance do you think would be in your head that it

03:03.440 --> 03:08.560
might actually be Lubega? Very high. Very, very, very high. And what are the odds that Lubega would

03:08.560 --> 03:12.480
be driving behind you, see that license plate, and then be thrown into a rage that you've stolen his

03:12.480 --> 03:17.360
identity, and then he drives you off the road, and you die? Five percent? I do what everybody's

03:18.080 --> 03:24.640
listening to the program right now. Just take a minute for yourself to imagine Lubega at the DMV

03:24.640 --> 03:28.720
in the state which he lives, explaining to them what he wants his personalized license plate to

03:28.720 --> 03:33.040
be. Because there is like a 30% chance that that actually did happen, so that's very exciting for

03:33.040 --> 03:36.320
me. A lot of good percentages. A lot of good statistical sort of analysis this episode so far.

03:36.320 --> 03:43.600
So after that, I started thinking about like, well, Mambo No. 5 is very funny. What about Scatman?

03:43.600 --> 03:50.640
Is Scatman just one that I could just grab? And the downside of that one to me did appear almost

03:50.640 --> 03:56.640
immediately. I'm going to draw in a diverse crowd with the Scatman license plate. Yeah,

03:56.640 --> 04:01.200
you're casting two wide nets with that one, it feels like. I'm surprised that that one hasn't

04:01.200 --> 04:06.240
been snapped up by like a sort of a reverent proctologist. I'm actually willing to bet, and I

04:06.240 --> 04:11.440
don't know much about the demographics of either, but I'm willing to bet that the one you might not

04:11.440 --> 04:17.360
be referencing might actually be bigger at this point than the one you're actually trying to

04:17.360 --> 04:21.680
reference. Travis is saying, and he's dancing around it, but there are more people who are into

04:21.680 --> 04:29.840
poop sex and poop play than there are people who are into the song Scatman. Or just into Scat in

04:29.840 --> 04:33.920
general. I don't know, like I'm saying, I don't know what the Scat fandom looks like. Travis is

04:33.920 --> 04:38.640
saying we've hit a point where there are more people into poop play than there are people into

04:39.440 --> 04:45.920
this cool way of making music with, you know, syllables and plosives and stuff. Perhaps. I

04:45.920 --> 04:50.080
don't want to, I'm not throwing my hat over the fence on this one, you know what I mean? I'm

04:50.080 --> 04:58.720
saying that. You're not throwing your scat over the fence. Now, I do want to mention that there,

04:58.720 --> 05:04.480
that is for the standard license plate. You can get a patriotic background that has two to six

05:04.480 --> 05:10.720
characters, and there's also a 9-11 never forget background that has two to six characters.

05:10.720 --> 05:13.920
Tough to thread that ironic comedy needle, though, is the problem.

05:13.920 --> 05:18.880
Yeah, it is, that couldn't think of a good 9-11 one except where it said never forget,

05:18.880 --> 05:23.440
I could get the license plate that said okay. So that's just kind of like, you got it, no problem,

05:23.440 --> 05:29.760
10-4. Agreed. I've been sitting here for the last 10 seconds trying to think the answer to this

05:29.760 --> 05:33.760
question. I think you might be able to help me out here as you are an experienced license plate

05:33.760 --> 05:40.160
smith. If you were going to get a license plate that said parrot head, what do you think is the

05:40.160 --> 05:47.120
right shortening of parrot to make it read clearly the first time through? Otherwise, I might see PRT

05:47.120 --> 05:50.960
head and be like, you're part head? Yeah, of course we all are. Dumb license plate,

05:50.960 --> 05:55.280
run them off the road and then you die. Here's what I think I would go with,

05:55.280 --> 05:59.600
Trav, because I was generally thinking about this, PRRT-HEAD.

05:59.600 --> 06:04.400
That's what I thought, too. That's what I was thinking as well, because I thought PROT

06:04.400 --> 06:08.720
looks like Prothead, P-A-R-T, part. Yeah.

06:08.720 --> 06:13.280
It has to be PRRT-HEAD. Are we doing emojis on these things now?

06:13.280 --> 06:17.360
No. Can we get hashtags?

06:17.360 --> 06:20.880
If I could get a hashtag, my momma number five license plate would be off the chain.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.840
I would have already gotten it. If I could get a hashtag in there, because that would-

06:24.960 --> 06:28.640
Jesus Christ, of course, because it stands in for number. I thought you were saying the

06:28.640 --> 06:33.200
license plate would be hashtag momma number five. I am just going to start putting that

06:33.200 --> 06:36.800
randomly on tweets. What are you doing with that license plate? I pulled you over because

06:36.800 --> 06:41.280
you were going 200 miles an hour in a school zone. First of all, what the fuck, but also

06:41.280 --> 06:45.520
like hashtag momma number five. What's it mean? I'm trying to get it trending. That's

06:45.520 --> 06:49.200
not how that works at all. But you're talking about it, aren't you?

06:50.480 --> 06:56.560
Here's the thing. I don't know if this just service isn't big in West Virginia or something.

06:56.560 --> 07:02.640
You can get anything. You can get anything you want. DTF, I could get it now.

07:02.640 --> 07:05.040
Because they don't know. They don't know what that is.

07:05.040 --> 07:11.280
Dougie Love, I could get it now. As someone, Fernon on Twitter suggested me iPhone 95. As

07:11.280 --> 07:15.600
long as I was in that period, I might as well check out the creators of Blue.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.440
What about RKY?

07:17.440 --> 07:20.160
It's just there. I can just get it.

07:20.160 --> 07:22.240
RKY MRTN.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.680
Yeah, that's possible. Hey, I just had a great idea.

07:25.680 --> 07:26.800
I'm just a fan.

07:26.800 --> 07:34.000
Here's a good idea for a public service commercial for teens. It's all these cars and they're

07:34.000 --> 07:39.520
driving way too fast in a city and all their license plates say like hashtag number five,

07:40.080 --> 07:44.720
hashtag squad goals and stuff like that, a bunch of hashtags, but it's real dangerous.

07:44.720 --> 07:50.560
The cars are crashing and stuff. Who's a respectable person these days? Who do people

07:50.560 --> 07:51.280
really look up to?

07:51.280 --> 07:54.160
Alan Alda.

07:54.160 --> 07:58.800
Alan Alda walks from the side of the frame after one of these hashtag cars crashes and

07:58.800 --> 08:04.640
says something like, the things you tweet, Twitter is real life dangerous or something

08:04.640 --> 08:08.480
like that. Just let kids know, you're really putting a message out there and you need to

08:08.480 --> 08:09.360
be smart about it.

08:09.360 --> 08:13.840
You're using hashtags fast and loose. You need to be careful because hashtags can get

08:13.840 --> 08:18.160
away from you and pretty soon your whole tweet is hashtags and you forgot to put an actual

08:18.160 --> 08:18.800
message in there.

08:18.800 --> 08:21.360
That's another thing Alan Alda, I want him to teach me about.

08:21.360 --> 08:24.880
RKY Can you fathom that with a single click,

08:24.880 --> 08:30.160
my license plate could just say cool dude. Like that is just an option.

08:30.160 --> 08:30.480
Travis Well how?

08:30.480 --> 08:32.400
RKY Cool dude.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.360
Travis Well how?

08:33.360 --> 08:34.960
RKY Just cool dude.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.800
Travis You can't have eight letters? I thought it

08:36.800 --> 08:37.440
had to be seven.

08:37.440 --> 08:42.480
RKY No, it's eight characters. Cool dude. You could just say cool dude.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.280
Travis I have no joke. I have before seen a license

08:45.280 --> 08:46.320
plate that said cool dud.

08:46.320 --> 08:49.680
RKY Oh, that's no good.

08:49.680 --> 08:52.640
Travis I'm pretty sure that's not what they were

08:52.640 --> 08:53.440
going for, but that is a cool dude.

08:53.440 --> 08:55.280
RKY That is a word.

08:55.280 --> 08:57.920
Travis One problematic thing with the cool dude

08:57.920 --> 09:06.800
plate though is that C00L dude looks indistinguishable and I'm not fucking going to prison for the

09:06.800 --> 09:10.080
crimes of cool 00L dude. No way.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.920
RKY For the leet cool dude.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.040
Travis No way.

09:13.040 --> 09:18.560
RKY What about king of road? King of fraud? Is

09:18.560 --> 09:19.040
that on there?

09:19.040 --> 09:20.080
Travis King of fraud?

09:20.080 --> 09:21.120
RKY That's literally a peep.

09:21.120 --> 09:21.360
Travis What are you talking about?

09:21.360 --> 09:24.400
RKY Yes, that's what I'm wanting. I'm just a

09:24.400 --> 09:25.920
big fan of the show and I would like that reference.

09:25.920 --> 09:28.000
Travis You could just get it to say frogger. I

09:28.000 --> 09:30.400
could just get frogger on there. I could just get it.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.560
RKY Juice, Justin, let me hit you with this,

09:32.560 --> 09:33.200
Seinfeld.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.200
Travis Hold on.

09:35.200 --> 09:39.040
RKY That might be the best one because

09:39.040 --> 09:40.640
Travis It's available.

09:40.640 --> 09:43.120
RKY There's infinite ways to read it and all

09:43.120 --> 09:47.280
of them are good. One, is that Jerry Seinfeld in that car? I got to find out. I don't know

09:47.280 --> 09:50.560
who that is, but it's not Jerry Seinfeld. Two, I'm

09:50.560 --> 09:52.720
also a fan of this television show.

09:52.720 --> 09:58.080
Travis Justin, look and see if W-V-G-O-V-N-E-R is

09:58.080 --> 09:58.640
available.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.200
Justin W-V-G-O-V-N-E-R.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.080
Travis Yeah, I could just get that.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.600
RKY Just bless Virginia Governor.

10:05.600 --> 10:06.640
Travis This is his car.

10:06.640 --> 10:10.080
RKY Wait a minute. Please get Seinfeld, please. I

10:10.080 --> 10:12.480
don't care. I'll literally pay you how much money it

10:12.480 --> 10:13.920
costs to get Seinfeld on your license plate. It

10:13.920 --> 10:15.920
will be an issue. We'll have to bleep out. We just

10:15.920 --> 10:17.840
won't release this episode because people will be

10:17.840 --> 10:19.360
able to track you down, I think, pretty easily. But

10:19.360 --> 10:20.960
Seinfeld, I think, should be your license plate,

10:20.960 --> 10:21.280
Justin.

10:21.280 --> 10:26.080
Justin Man, Seinfeld's very good.

10:26.080 --> 10:27.520
RKY Ooh, it's a temptation, huh?

10:27.520 --> 10:29.440
Justin God, it's really good. The problem is

10:29.440 --> 10:32.720
they're all so good that I don't know. I feel like

10:32.720 --> 10:35.120
I'll get it and instantly have thought of 30 better

10:35.120 --> 10:37.520
ones, but that's a problem for me.

10:37.520 --> 10:39.520
RKY Man, I had no idea West Virginia was just

10:39.520 --> 10:44.240
fucking Wild Wild West in terms of license plate,

10:44.240 --> 10:45.280
what they'll let you put on it.

10:45.280 --> 10:48.080
Justin Question. When you get a license plate and

10:48.080 --> 10:50.720
then get a different one, does the original one go

10:50.720 --> 10:53.680
back in circulation or is it, like, retired? Because

10:53.680 --> 10:56.960
then, Justin, you could just keep getting different

10:56.960 --> 10:57.280
ones.

10:57.280 --> 10:58.640
Justin Yeah, just cycle it out.

10:58.640 --> 11:01.120
Justin Yeah, like your URL collection you've been

11:01.120 --> 11:02.160
building over the years.

11:02.160 --> 11:05.280
Justin Yeah, man.

11:05.280 --> 11:08.720
RKY Let's ruminate on this. Maybe we circle back.

11:08.720 --> 11:09.920
I think we should start doing advice.

11:09.920 --> 11:13.200
Justin Okay, here's our first question. I got my

11:13.200 --> 11:16.320
nipple pierced and then got a job at a grocery store.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.640
Any suggestions on how to protect tender body parts

11:18.640 --> 11:21.600
when working a physical job? What do I say when

11:21.600 --> 11:24.560
coworkers see me wince and look concerned? That's

11:24.560 --> 11:26.000
from Bashful in Brooklyn.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.080
RKY Can I real quick? I had two closers for this

11:30.080 --> 11:33.120
episode, and this one is Jermaine, and so I'll just

11:33.120 --> 11:35.920
do it now. It was sent in by Seth Carlson, and the

11:35.920 --> 11:38.720
question was simply, what gauge are Dave Navarro's

11:38.720 --> 11:39.600
nipple piercings?

11:39.600 --> 11:44.960
Justin I can really sympathize with this one.

11:44.960 --> 11:47.760
This one I'm really familiar with.

11:47.760 --> 11:50.800
RKY I would love to hear why that's true.

11:50.800 --> 11:54.160
Justin Well, in my preteen years, no, probably

11:54.160 --> 11:58.320
teenage years, our parents secured for me somehow,

11:58.320 --> 12:00.080
it was probably a free promotion sent to the radio

12:00.080 --> 12:01.760
station because that's how we ended up with a lot of

12:01.760 --> 12:07.120
our earthly goods in those days. It was an Anaheim

12:07.120 --> 12:11.600
Mighty Ducks shirt, and the shirt was nylon with an

12:11.600 --> 12:17.200
Anaheim Mighty Ducks patch where your heart would

12:17.200 --> 12:21.120
be, but it's also where my left nipple was, and the

12:21.120 --> 12:25.760
embroidery of that patch caused me basically

12:25.760 --> 12:31.360
infinite nipple distress. So I'm like so on board

12:31.360 --> 12:33.520
with this one. It's a problem.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.480
RKY I remember when our parents also bought,

12:36.480 --> 12:38.320
our parents just like, I guess they didn't give a

12:38.320 --> 12:41.200
shit about our nippular health. We went to the

12:41.200 --> 12:44.560
beach one time, bought us some cheap ass boogie

12:44.560 --> 12:47.840
boards from like Wings or something like that, and

12:47.840 --> 12:53.360
I fucking buffed my chest, I buffed my torso down

12:53.360 --> 12:56.400
to a perfect flat shine. Somebody else could have

12:56.400 --> 12:59.040
used me as a boogie board after what this boogie

12:59.040 --> 13:01.440
Justin Your belly button was like Kyle XY, which is

13:01.440 --> 13:02.960
the only thing I know from Kyle XY.

13:02.960 --> 13:06.320
RKY This was a water sports wet stone, essentially,

13:06.320 --> 13:10.480
for boys, and it just, it sharpened me down, and it

13:10.480 --> 13:12.400
was, and which is great because you know what the

13:12.400 --> 13:14.560
ocean is? A bunch of salt water. Get that in your

13:14.560 --> 13:17.840
your flattened nips areas, and it's just a bad

13:17.840 --> 13:19.200
vacation in general.

13:19.200 --> 13:22.000
KYLE You know the funny thing about Wings and the

13:22.000 --> 13:25.360
bad quality products at America's Wings and Eagles

13:25.360 --> 13:27.440
and all the other beach shops? Now that I'm like a

13:27.440 --> 13:29.200
little more established adult, when I go to the

13:29.200 --> 13:32.400
beach, sometimes I'm willing to pay a little bit

13:32.400 --> 13:34.880
more for a higher quality product, and they simply

13:34.880 --> 13:37.440
don't exist. There's no place that's marketing

13:37.440 --> 13:39.760
itself as like the better upscale.

13:39.760 --> 13:40.880
Wings.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.800
KYLE Once you're on the island and you're living

13:42.800 --> 13:45.920
on island time, these are all you have, and like

13:45.920 --> 13:48.000
it's this weird block in my brain where there's just

13:48.000 --> 13:50.880
no reality. I'm gonna allow myself to like buy a

13:50.880 --> 13:54.000
boogie board on Amazon and remember to do, it feels

13:54.000 --> 13:54.640
wrong somehow.

13:54.640 --> 13:58.880
RKY It's not correct, yeah. So protection of your

13:58.880 --> 14:01.040
tender body parts when working physically. So I

14:01.040 --> 14:06.000
imagine you're carrying a big crate of, you know,

14:06.000 --> 14:08.720
avocados or whatever, and you're using your,

14:08.720 --> 14:11.120
everybody knows that you lift from the nipples, and

14:11.120 --> 14:13.680
so like the box is just there and pressing up

14:13.680 --> 14:18.160
against your region. Is it always tender? These are

14:18.160 --> 14:19.760
things I don't know about nipple piercings, but is

14:19.760 --> 14:22.080
it always tender or does it heal eventually?

14:22.080 --> 14:26.160
KYLE I mean, it's tender by nature, right? Like

14:26.160 --> 14:29.360
not by nature, for sure.

14:29.360 --> 14:31.680
RYON Do you think it would be possible to

14:31.680 --> 14:34.800
convince your bosses and maybe your co-workers that

14:34.800 --> 14:37.760
it is not a nipple piercing, but in fact shrapnel

14:37.760 --> 14:40.720
from an explosion that doctors advised you was

14:40.720 --> 14:42.240
safer to just leave there?

14:42.240 --> 14:47.600
KYLE It just got me. This grenade, oh, I got out

14:47.600 --> 14:50.880
of the way. It just got me. It got me like the least

14:50.880 --> 14:55.440
an explosion could get you. I just got it. If I'd

14:55.440 --> 14:57.680
been just a little bit faster, I would have got

14:57.680 --> 15:00.000
out of the way, but it just barely nicked me right

15:00.000 --> 15:00.240
there.

15:00.240 --> 15:03.360
KYLE I hear you saying, Philip, pick up the

15:03.360 --> 15:06.480
fucking boxes anyway. Get over it. But let me tell

15:06.480 --> 15:10.480
you, this other thing is the reason that the

15:10.480 --> 15:14.400
grenade got me is because I was being a hero in

15:14.400 --> 15:15.840
some way. I don't know.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.840
RYON I was vaguely hero-ing.

15:17.840 --> 15:20.560
KYLE I was being heroic. I don't want to get

15:20.560 --> 15:23.200
into the details. They're almost as painful as

15:23.200 --> 15:27.760
this sort of impromptu nipple piercing, but...

15:27.760 --> 15:29.360
RYON This daily reminder.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.120
KYLE Yeah, of my heroism.

15:31.120 --> 15:34.720
RYON Did you see Kindergarten Cop? Because

15:34.720 --> 15:36.880
more or less, grenade went into Kindergarten. I

15:36.880 --> 15:41.040
threw it out of the room. I thought I was clear.

15:43.680 --> 15:47.120
I was barely in the door frame. Just a little bit.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.960
It was enough to catch it right there.

15:48.960 --> 15:50.800
KYLE Apparently, nerve right there runs right

15:50.800 --> 15:52.240
through my heart. Can't remove it.

15:52.240 --> 15:54.640
RYON Can't remove it. Got a special ring put

15:54.640 --> 15:56.800
in there. Ring powers my super suit. It's a little

15:56.800 --> 15:59.680
bit offset, the ring is, my power ring. It's not

15:59.680 --> 16:01.360
like Iron Man's where it's right in the center.

16:01.360 --> 16:02.480
Mine's a bit offset.

16:02.480 --> 16:05.920
KYLE Long story short, can't stock milk. Metal

16:05.920 --> 16:06.560
will get cold.

16:06.560 --> 16:07.120
RYON Can't stock milk today.

16:07.120 --> 16:07.680
KYLE Sorry.

16:07.680 --> 16:11.120
RYON Sorry. I was a hero, though, so I'm going

16:11.120 --> 16:13.280
to need worker's comp for this one.

16:13.280 --> 16:14.960
KYLE I wanted to convince Blockbuster I was

16:14.960 --> 16:17.520
allergic to Windex so I wouldn't have to do

16:17.520 --> 16:18.560
cleaning at the end of the night.

16:18.560 --> 16:19.600
RYON Jesus, I'm glad you're my brother.

16:19.600 --> 16:22.160
KYLE God, they really let go of a really

16:22.160 --> 16:23.600
cheery employee, Justin.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.400
RYON I'm glad you're my brother, Justin, and

16:26.400 --> 16:28.800
that you're not working against me in some way.

16:28.800 --> 16:31.840
KYLE With stratagems like that, I'm glad

16:31.840 --> 16:35.520
you're on my side and not an opponent of some

16:35.520 --> 16:35.840
sort.

16:35.840 --> 16:37.440
RYON That's got to be a move where you say,

16:37.440 --> 16:39.200
I'm allergic to Windex, and the thought in their

16:39.200 --> 16:41.280
brain has to be like, I don't believe that, but

16:41.280 --> 16:43.200
also why would someone go to the trouble of

16:43.200 --> 16:44.160
lying about that?

16:44.160 --> 16:47.360
KYLE I also convinced them for a year I didn't

16:47.360 --> 16:50.640
know how to vacuum, because it would get to be

16:50.640 --> 16:53.920
1130 and we would be like, time to vacuum, and

16:53.920 --> 16:56.320
I would tell them, I don't know how to vacuum.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.720
And no one was going to take that last half hour

16:58.720 --> 17:00.240
to teach you how to vacuum.

17:00.240 --> 17:02.960
No one's going to Finding Forrester you through

17:03.600 --> 17:04.480
vacuuming.

17:04.480 --> 17:05.840
So it's just going to be like, well, fine, I'll

17:05.840 --> 17:06.720
do it again.

17:06.720 --> 17:09.200
And I don't know, it made for pretty chill

17:09.200 --> 17:09.920
evenings for me.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.040
I restocked the candy.

17:11.600 --> 17:13.120
And let me tell you, that's thirsty work.

17:13.120 --> 17:18.720
KYLE Thirsty for candy?

17:18.720 --> 17:19.440
RYON Yeah, sure.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.200
Y'all want a Yahoo?

17:21.200 --> 17:22.320
KYLE Yes.

17:22.320 --> 17:23.920
RYON This one was also sent in by Seth

17:23.920 --> 17:24.320
Carlson.

17:24.320 --> 17:27.360
Seth Carlson sent in like 800, and a lot of them

17:27.360 --> 17:27.840
are very good.

17:27.840 --> 17:28.400
Thank you, Seth.

17:28.400 --> 17:33.680
So Yahoo Answers user Stephen asks, what is the

17:33.680 --> 17:35.920
third choice in tic-tac-toe?

17:37.120 --> 17:42.080
The game Knots and Crosses, imaginary, made up,

17:42.080 --> 17:44.640
whole cloth, a fabrication.

17:45.360 --> 17:47.760
The game Knots and Crosses is obviously a simple

17:47.760 --> 17:51.440
game involving zero and X, or circle, or O.

17:52.960 --> 17:55.840
The game tic-tac-toe sounds like it ought to have

17:55.840 --> 18:00.960
tics, tacks, and toes, not circle and X.

18:00.960 --> 18:02.160
What's the third symbol?

18:03.040 --> 18:04.960
We've all played this great game.

18:04.960 --> 18:06.080
KYLE Sure.

18:06.080 --> 18:13.680
RYON This game of strategy, and you're not

18:13.680 --> 18:15.600
playing the board, right?

18:15.600 --> 18:19.360
You're not playing the hash.

18:19.360 --> 18:22.160
You're playing the person on the other side of the hash.

18:22.160 --> 18:28.240
But is there an element to tic-tac-toe that we've

18:28.240 --> 18:28.880
never considered?

18:28.880 --> 18:30.320
Which is to say the toe.

18:32.640 --> 18:33.920
It's in the rulebook.

18:33.920 --> 18:36.560
If you really find the tic-tac-toe rulebook and

18:36.560 --> 18:38.720
crack it open, you'll learn about the toe.

18:38.720 --> 18:41.840
And I'm wondering if this is a procedure that we can

18:41.840 --> 18:44.960
bring into the game to maybe make it not so shitty.

18:44.960 --> 18:49.040
I don't know that I've won or lost a game of tic-tac-toe

18:49.040 --> 18:50.720
in the last decade.

18:50.720 --> 18:53.520
And I'm wondering if that's because there's a sort of

18:53.520 --> 18:56.160
a central component missing, which is to say the toe.

18:56.160 --> 18:59.600
KYLE Is it also possible, Griffin, that maybe

18:59.600 --> 19:03.680
what we've lost over time is a hyphen, and originally

19:03.680 --> 19:06.720
we were supposed to be playing with tiny round candies

19:06.720 --> 19:08.240
and severed toes?

19:10.240 --> 19:14.160
RYON Now, how did this get to be the conversation?

19:14.160 --> 19:16.480
KYLE Because it's like tic-tacs.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.320
RYON All right.

19:18.320 --> 19:22.320
All right, now I understand.

19:22.320 --> 19:24.000
It's entirely possible, Travis.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.280
KYLE I mean, or else where do tic-tacs get their

19:27.280 --> 19:27.600
name?

19:27.600 --> 19:28.480
You know what I mean?

19:28.480 --> 19:28.800
You know?

19:28.800 --> 19:31.440
RYON Let's just, Travis, take me on one on one

19:31.440 --> 19:31.760
right now.

19:31.760 --> 19:32.400
We don't need the board.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.480
Just fucking mind palace it with me, okay?

19:34.480 --> 19:36.080
I put an X in the middle.

19:36.080 --> 19:37.040
KYLE Well, fuck.

19:37.040 --> 19:38.960
KYLE It's over.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.000
RYON You've already lost.

19:40.000 --> 19:40.640
KYLE It's done.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.480
I put one in the top left corner.

19:42.480 --> 19:43.760
I put a circle.

19:43.760 --> 19:44.640
Top left corner.

19:44.640 --> 19:45.280
RYON Okay.

19:45.280 --> 19:52.880
KYLE Okay, I put an X, I put an X at the shit.

19:52.880 --> 19:54.000
See, you've countered me.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.440
There's no coming back from that.

19:55.440 --> 19:58.000
RYON Wait, Griffin, I have an idea for what the

19:58.000 --> 19:58.480
toe is.

19:58.480 --> 19:59.520
Okay, let's start over.

19:59.520 --> 19:59.920
Start over.

19:59.920 --> 20:00.400
Wipe the board.

20:00.400 --> 20:00.880
Wipe the board.

20:00.880 --> 20:01.680
KYLE Okay, okay, okay.

20:01.680 --> 20:02.480
Can I still start?

20:02.480 --> 20:02.880
RYON Yeah.

20:02.880 --> 20:05.920
KYLE I put an X in the center.

20:05.920 --> 20:08.480
RYON I put an O in the center.

20:08.480 --> 20:08.800
Toe.

20:08.800 --> 20:11.040
KYLE Now, hold on.

20:11.040 --> 20:11.520
RYON Yeah.

20:11.520 --> 20:13.920
KYLE You're saying the toe is an essential fucking

20:13.920 --> 20:17.760
combo breaker fucking cancel.

20:17.760 --> 20:18.160
It's a move cancel.

20:18.160 --> 20:20.560
RYON One of the additional lost rule is that

20:20.560 --> 20:24.160
once per game you can deploy that uber powerful toe.

20:24.160 --> 20:26.160
KYLE Is it one toe per player?

20:26.160 --> 20:26.800
RYON Yeah.

20:26.800 --> 20:27.760
Each player gets one toe.

20:27.760 --> 20:28.240
KYLE Okay.

20:28.240 --> 20:29.040
Check this out.

20:29.040 --> 20:29.840
Round three.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.600
I put an X over the center.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.680
RYON Fuck.

20:33.680 --> 20:34.640
Okay.

20:34.640 --> 20:39.600
Wait, what if the lost rule is like everybody just doesn't

20:39.600 --> 20:42.480
finish ranking the board and the circle, the middle square is

20:42.480 --> 20:45.360
supposed to be both an X and an O and you just fill in the

20:45.360 --> 20:46.320
outside square.

20:46.320 --> 20:47.920
KYLE Let me hit you with this.

20:47.920 --> 20:48.480
RYON Okay.

20:48.480 --> 20:52.240
KYLE In the case of a draw, both players are killed.

20:52.240 --> 20:53.520
RYON I love this.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.360
Stream team tack toe.

20:55.360 --> 20:57.760
KYLE So Travis, again, that's the only rule.

20:58.480 --> 21:00.080
Let's try this one out, not the cancel one.

21:00.080 --> 21:00.480
RYON Well, hold on.

21:00.480 --> 21:02.880
KYLE If there's a draw, we're both going to be

21:02.880 --> 21:03.600
killed, okay?

21:03.600 --> 21:04.160
I put an X in the center.

21:04.160 --> 21:05.440
RYON Wait, but what happens if I lose?

21:05.440 --> 21:07.120
KYLE I put an X in the center.

21:07.120 --> 21:08.800
You'll be killed and I'll live.

21:08.800 --> 21:09.840
RYON I see.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.000
Bottom left corner.

21:12.000 --> 21:12.960
KYLE Okay.

21:14.240 --> 21:17.360
I put an X at the middle left.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.440
Now really think hard about what you want to do next here,

21:19.440 --> 21:19.760
Trav.

21:19.760 --> 21:23.520
RYON One of us can walk away from this or-

21:23.520 --> 21:24.640
KYLE Middle right.

21:24.640 --> 21:25.360
Middle right.

21:25.360 --> 21:28.000
KYLE Travis, why would you-

21:28.000 --> 21:30.480
RYON If I'm going down, you're coming down with

21:30.480 --> 21:30.880
me, Griffin.

21:30.880 --> 21:31.040
I'm not letting you.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.880
KYLE X bottom right.

21:32.880 --> 21:36.160
RYON Circle top left.

21:36.160 --> 21:38.080
KYLE See, why are you doing this?

21:38.080 --> 21:39.200
Like you don't want one of us to-

21:39.200 --> 21:39.920
RYON I'm taking you down with me now.

21:39.920 --> 21:41.440
KYLE Justin, are you hearing this shit?

21:41.440 --> 21:43.520
RYON A lot of people ask me, Justin,

21:43.520 --> 21:46.640
where's a good place to start with my bim bam?

21:46.640 --> 21:48.720
And I never know what to tell them.

21:48.720 --> 21:51.520
But now I'll at least be able to conclusively say,

21:52.080 --> 21:53.920
not the one where they play audio tape.

21:53.920 --> 21:55.440
KYLE But this is what I'm saying, Justin.

21:55.440 --> 21:55.920
You listen to this-

21:55.920 --> 21:56.800
RYON You're going to play your, Griffin.

21:56.800 --> 21:57.440
Game's not over.

21:57.440 --> 21:58.000
Game's not over.

21:58.000 --> 21:58.640
Game's not over.

21:58.640 --> 22:01.120
KYLE Justin, you're watching this killing game

22:01.120 --> 22:02.960
and you're going to walk away from it with no brothers.

22:02.960 --> 22:04.880
Do you want no brothers or one brother?

22:04.880 --> 22:05.360
Is there some-

22:05.360 --> 22:09.600
Like now I like this element of a third party trying to like,

22:09.600 --> 22:12.240
trying to like make sure to limit damage.

22:12.240 --> 22:15.600
RYON When my quote unquote brothers have decided to

22:16.160 --> 22:21.040
deep six one of the primary means I use to feed my toddler daughter

22:21.040 --> 22:25.280
and keep her in the shop-able fashions that she enjoys.

22:25.280 --> 22:27.680
Like right now I'm kind of unequivocal.

22:27.680 --> 22:28.880
KYLE Bottom middle, Travis.

22:28.880 --> 22:29.520
RYON Fuck!

22:30.160 --> 22:30.960
Thought I had you.

22:30.960 --> 22:32.800
KYLE Nah, dude.

22:32.800 --> 22:33.680
You don't have shit.

22:33.680 --> 22:35.680
RYON I believe top middle is still available.

22:35.680 --> 22:36.400
KYLE No.

22:36.400 --> 22:38.080
RYON Top right.

22:38.080 --> 22:39.600
KYLE Top middle, I win.

22:39.600 --> 22:40.240
It was available.

22:40.240 --> 22:41.280
RYON Whoa, fuck!

22:41.280 --> 22:43.520
KYLE Sorry, Travis.

22:43.520 --> 22:45.760
RYON That does actually make the game a little bit better.

22:45.760 --> 22:46.400
KYLE See?

22:46.400 --> 22:49.440
RYON Why is this awful game allowed?

22:49.440 --> 22:53.600
Why can I not get another Seaman and yet everybody knows Tic Tacs How?

22:53.600 --> 22:54.800
It drives me up a wall.

22:54.800 --> 22:55.840
It's a bad game.

22:55.840 --> 22:58.880
KYLE It's a bad game if you don't have the toe.

22:59.440 --> 23:02.320
And that stands for total death of both people playing.

23:02.320 --> 23:04.400
If in the case of a draw.

23:04.400 --> 23:06.000
RYON I'm going to make one more change.

23:06.000 --> 23:06.800
KYLE Okay.

23:06.800 --> 23:08.560
RYON Right now it's played three by three.

23:08.560 --> 23:09.920
We play ten by ten.

23:09.920 --> 23:10.480
Your move.

23:10.480 --> 23:10.880
Go.

23:10.880 --> 23:11.440
Start it out.

23:11.440 --> 23:12.560
KYLE Okay.

23:12.560 --> 23:15.680
I'm going to go with grid four, two.

23:15.680 --> 23:16.320
RYON Okay.

23:16.320 --> 23:16.960
KYLE Dammit.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.240
KYLE Sunk his battleship.

23:18.240 --> 23:19.040
RYON All right.

23:19.040 --> 23:20.480
Next question.

23:20.480 --> 23:21.120
I'm moving on.

23:21.120 --> 23:23.120
I'm taking the show back from you monsters.

23:23.120 --> 23:25.680
RYON I'm going to keep playing throughout the game though.

23:25.680 --> 23:26.720
KYLE That's fine.

23:26.720 --> 23:27.920
See, that's fun.

23:27.920 --> 23:33.680
If you have to play over a period of time where no one can see the board, I think that maybe

23:33.680 --> 23:34.960
makes it a little more interesting.

23:34.960 --> 23:35.680
And one toe.

23:35.680 --> 23:39.280
RYON To answer the core question, what is the third choice in tic-tac-toe?

23:39.280 --> 23:40.640
The answer is to live.

23:40.640 --> 23:44.480
KYLE Brothers.

23:44.480 --> 23:47.360
RYON This question got deleted, by the way, while we were talking.

23:47.360 --> 23:52.560
KYLE An excellent service.

23:52.560 --> 23:55.520
RYON All right.

23:56.480 --> 23:57.360
Brothers, help me.

23:57.360 --> 24:00.640
I've been talking to this person for three weeks online thinking she was a different

24:00.640 --> 24:01.680
friend of mine.

24:01.680 --> 24:07.040
By the time I found out she and my friend weren't, in fact, the same person, it was

24:07.040 --> 24:08.320
too late to go back on it.

24:09.600 --> 24:14.080
Should I come clean with this person about my mistake, or should I just keep the friendship

24:14.080 --> 24:15.760
going like nothing happened?

24:15.760 --> 24:20.160
I don't even know her name, but we've been talking like we've known each other for years.

24:20.800 --> 24:26.880
That's from Cornered in California, and it's also from my plot synopsis of You've Got Mail

24:26.880 --> 24:33.280
To coming to theaters next fall, it's going to be a love story you'll never forget.

24:33.280 --> 24:34.160
KYLE It's a lot.

24:37.280 --> 24:41.440
Hey, it's hard to make friends to put yourself out there.

24:41.440 --> 24:44.960
You may have accidentally discovered a great way to do just that.

24:45.600 --> 24:51.920
If I could talk to strangers the way I talk to my friends confidently, I would have more

24:51.920 --> 24:59.200
friends, but I'm too nervous to talk to somebody like that, and so I don't have more friends.

24:59.200 --> 25:02.480
But you found a way to do it on a sort of circuitous way.

25:03.600 --> 25:12.080
I think you just say like, hey, by the way, I'm Tony, people call me Tony the Pony, and

25:12.080 --> 25:16.800
I don't actually know who you are, but I feel like we're friends now, so that's great,

25:16.800 --> 25:18.800
that's good, that's just across the board good.

25:18.800 --> 25:23.120
AARON Let's take a moment, and I just want to parse

25:23.120 --> 25:26.640
this just for a second to talk about my favorite element of this question.

25:27.440 --> 25:31.040
You maybe saw like a screen name, thought it was your friend's screen name, but there

25:31.040 --> 25:34.160
was like one letter difference or whatever, but you didn't know that at first, so you're

25:34.160 --> 25:35.120
like, hey, what's up?

25:35.760 --> 25:37.760
I need to tell you, I'm moving.

25:37.760 --> 25:40.320
Oh, I haven't seen you in forever, whatever the conversation was.

25:40.960 --> 25:45.600
And then after three weeks, you texted your actual friend, and they're like, that's not me.

25:45.600 --> 25:48.640
AARON The person in this that I'm most curious

25:48.640 --> 25:55.120
about is this third party person that like you just like contacted out of the blue, and

25:55.120 --> 25:59.520
they know they don't know you, like they didn't think you were their friend, and they were

25:59.520 --> 26:02.160
just like, all right, yeah, I'm game.

26:02.160 --> 26:04.320
AARON That's the great thing about this tool,

26:04.320 --> 26:11.360
though, is that if you deploy it on an unsuspecting party, they are powerless to sort of resist

26:11.360 --> 26:17.840
its thrall, like, oh, you must, I guess we're friends, like, let's just roll with it, I

26:17.840 --> 26:18.400
guess.

26:18.400 --> 26:19.920
You've lowered all my defenses.

26:19.920 --> 26:22.400
GRIFFIN Yeah, I mean, and y'all know my favorite

26:22.400 --> 26:28.800
seafood dish is catfish, and that's what you're dealing with right now, is a catfishing situation.

26:28.800 --> 26:30.080
AARON But this is like a reverse catfish, GRIFFIN.

26:30.080 --> 26:31.920
GRIFFIN It's a light catfish, yeah.

26:31.920 --> 26:34.320
AARON This is like you said to a stranger, I think

26:34.320 --> 26:35.280
you're my friend, Bill.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.560
Like, you basically handed them the rod and reel and hooked the hook in your mouth.

26:40.560 --> 26:45.840
GRIFFIN You don't see that often on the movie or TV

26:45.840 --> 26:49.840
show, catfish, of just like, I think you're my girlfriend?

26:50.560 --> 26:51.840
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

26:51.840 --> 26:52.480
You said yes.

26:52.480 --> 26:53.440
AARON All right.

26:53.440 --> 26:54.560
GRIFFIN Here we go.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.680
What is this service you're using, by the way, where you were online chatting with a

26:59.680 --> 27:02.560
person without knowing their identity?

27:02.560 --> 27:05.840
AARON My hope and prayer to good lord above is AOL

27:05.840 --> 27:06.640
instant messenger.

27:06.640 --> 27:08.400
GRIFFIN That's the only thing I can think.

27:08.400 --> 27:14.240
You ended up in a fucking, like, firefly role playing server, and you're like, oh, you sound

27:14.240 --> 27:15.520
like my friend Denise.

27:15.520 --> 27:20.560
She also likes Wash, so you must be her anyway.

27:20.560 --> 27:23.600
AARON We might also be like, we might be in a

27:23.600 --> 27:27.680
frequency situation where you are instant messaging this person, and they're still back

27:27.680 --> 27:28.640
in 1995.

27:28.640 --> 27:31.200
GRIFFIN Oh, you gotta be careful, your fucking thumb's

27:31.200 --> 27:33.760
gonna disappear, because of something that happened back in 95.

27:33.760 --> 27:37.840
You gotta be so careful when you're chatting in these online role playing

27:37.840 --> 27:42.480
servers, because if you're not careful, you're gonna frequency yourself, and your whole friggin,

27:42.480 --> 27:47.680
like, head's gonna disappear, because of something that happened 20 ding-dang years ago.

27:47.680 --> 27:48.960
You gotta be so careful.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.000
AARON Gotta be so careful.

27:51.200 --> 27:52.560
But think of the good you could do.

27:52.560 --> 27:53.520
GRIFFIN You could do good.

27:53.520 --> 27:54.240
You could do lots of good.

27:54.240 --> 27:54.720
AARON For sure.

27:54.720 --> 27:57.760
AARON But you don't know what it- here's the thing.

27:57.760 --> 28:01.440
You might think you have to do good to do good, but maybe, like, you have to lie to

28:01.440 --> 28:03.200
them to do some good, you know what I mean?

28:03.200 --> 28:06.400
And do get them to quit smoking, because, like, that's always good.

28:06.400 --> 28:06.880
That's a positive.

28:06.880 --> 28:11.040
AARON If you could talk to somebody in 1995, wouldn't

28:11.040 --> 28:15.760
it be dope to tell them, like, listen, you're gonna hear about a movie called Pirates of

28:15.760 --> 28:18.960
the Caribbean, and it's honestly gonna pop off.

28:18.960 --> 28:23.680
So, when you hear about it, just start talking a big game about how dope it's gonna be, and

28:23.680 --> 28:25.360
no one's gonna believe you.

28:25.360 --> 28:27.840
And you're gonna come off sounding, like, so smart.

28:27.840 --> 28:31.440
GRIFFIN So, that's the message that Justin would

28:31.440 --> 28:39.280
send back- just to- in 1995, that's sort of the warning that Justin would prioritize.

28:39.280 --> 28:41.280
He sends it back in time through his magic microwave.

28:41.280 --> 28:47.520
That's the one that he wants to make sure gets out there, get ready for this, will catch

28:47.520 --> 28:48.720
the heat, catch the wave.

28:48.720 --> 28:50.080
AARON I'm sorry, Justin.

28:50.080 --> 28:54.400
I think that's actually very short-sighted, because what I would do is I would say, person

28:54.400 --> 28:58.160
back in 1995, get a hold of young Travis McRoy.

28:58.160 --> 29:01.040
He's very excited about the Pirates of the Caribbean movie.

29:01.040 --> 29:05.280
But let him know that 20 years later, they're still making them, and they're terrible, and

29:05.280 --> 29:09.280
he should not, because in the future, the fact that he saw Pirates of the Caribbean

29:09.280 --> 29:13.840
one in theaters nine times is going to be like an albatross around his neck.

29:13.840 --> 29:18.400
So, tell him not to get excited about Pirates of the Caribbean, or don't discuss it openly

29:18.400 --> 29:19.760
on a podcast several times.

29:19.760 --> 29:23.360
GRIFFIN Yeah, and also, just- hey, 1995 person, just

29:23.360 --> 29:25.520
go ahead and get off the depth train now.

29:25.520 --> 29:28.880
You trust me on this one, you're gonna want to hop that one off before it reaches a certain

29:28.880 --> 29:29.360
station.

29:29.360 --> 29:34.080
Um, you need to get- just get right off that one, and then you send- send it.

29:34.080 --> 29:34.720
Send message.

29:35.280 --> 29:39.520
You know, who would you all talk to through your magic microwave to send back to 1995?

29:39.520 --> 29:41.920
Who would you all want to chat with?

29:41.920 --> 29:45.040
AARON Probably Dad, just to keep up with the frequency

29:45.040 --> 29:46.240
kind of storyline.

29:46.240 --> 29:47.680
GRIFFIN See, ironically-

29:47.680 --> 29:49.360
AARON Dad, Coke Zero's coming.

29:49.360 --> 29:50.880
You're gonna be so excited about it.

29:50.880 --> 29:53.120
GRIFFIN It's the only beverage you'll ever drink.

29:53.120 --> 29:54.480
Enjoy other beverages now.

29:54.480 --> 29:58.800
Fucking keep cracking that crystal clearly Canadian, because fucking, once Coke Zero

29:58.800 --> 30:00.480
comes out, it's the only one you're ever gonna do.

30:00.480 --> 30:01.920
AARON That actually is what I would do.

30:01.920 --> 30:04.640
I would ask Dad to just start hoarding clearly Canadian for me.

30:04.640 --> 30:05.200
GRIFFIN Mm-hmm.

30:05.200 --> 30:07.680
AARON Dad, buy up all the Surge you can find.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.680
Get Josta in bulk.

30:09.680 --> 30:12.240
AARON Surge is back, so that would have been a

30:12.240 --> 30:13.120
little bit of a waste.

30:13.120 --> 30:16.800
Josta though, I would- I would love a nice cold Josta right now.

30:16.800 --> 30:19.440
GRIFFIN I think I would- ironically enough, I think

30:19.440 --> 30:20.720
I'd chat with Dennis Quaid.

30:20.720 --> 30:22.720
AARON Oh, interesting.

30:22.720 --> 30:25.840
GRIFFIN You'd talk to 1995 Dennis Quaid?

30:25.840 --> 30:29.360
AARON Yeah, and I'd be like, there's a good

30:29.360 --> 30:30.880
frequency joke for my podcast.

30:30.880 --> 30:33.200
GRIFFIN Also, check on Randy.

30:33.200 --> 30:33.920
Talk to him more.

30:33.920 --> 30:35.600
AARON Hey, talk to Randy more.

30:35.600 --> 30:38.880
AARON Uh, Frequency had that dope Garth Brooks

30:38.880 --> 30:39.120
song.

30:40.160 --> 30:41.920
When you come back to me again, you remember that one?

30:41.920 --> 30:44.720
GRIFFIN Um, how about Money's Money?

30:44.720 --> 30:46.480
AARON Yeah, that's fine.

30:46.480 --> 30:48.320
We're probably gonna have to pay the rights of somebody after that.

30:48.320 --> 30:50.320
GRIFFIN After- sorry, no?

30:50.320 --> 30:51.680
Discussing the movie Frequency?

30:51.680 --> 30:52.880
You think we're gonna have to pay the rights?

30:53.440 --> 30:54.560
How do you think that works?

30:54.560 --> 31:08.400
AARON Hey, this first ad is about shaving?

31:08.400 --> 31:09.360
GRIFFIN Okay.

31:09.360 --> 31:12.400
AARON What is- what am- what am shaving?

31:12.400 --> 31:12.880
What is this?

31:12.880 --> 31:16.560
GRIFFIN It's when your hair, which we can all agree

31:17.600 --> 31:19.600
is bad.

31:19.600 --> 31:21.440
You want to, like, punish it and send it to

31:21.440 --> 31:23.840
Sink Jail.

31:23.840 --> 31:27.680
And the way that you get it there is you use a very sharp blade, which sounds, like,

31:28.400 --> 31:30.000
really dangerous, but it's not.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.880
Because when Harry's makes it, they know they're shit.

31:32.880 --> 31:35.440
So that's just been my personal experience.

31:35.440 --> 31:36.720
AARON This is not a joke.

31:36.720 --> 31:41.120
Recently I bought what I basically consider a shaving bib.

31:41.120 --> 31:42.080
GRIFFIN Oh.

31:42.080 --> 31:44.640
AARON It's got two suction cups on it that suction

31:44.640 --> 31:50.880
cup to the mirror, and then it clasps around my neck, so that when I trim my beard and shave,

31:50.880 --> 31:53.200
it just all goes down to the jail in the sink.

31:53.200 --> 31:55.360
GRIFFIN It all goes to the bib, and then I can throw

31:55.360 --> 31:58.240
it in the garbage instead of clogging up my sink.

31:58.240 --> 32:02.560
AARON So you attach your face to your bathroom mirror,

32:02.560 --> 32:05.600
you, like, sort of strap yourself into a shaving harness.

32:05.600 --> 32:06.000
GRIFFIN Yeah.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.520
AARON Kind of like in Pacific Rim.

32:07.520 --> 32:09.200
GRIFFIN And then I hope and pray there's not an

32:09.200 --> 32:11.680
emergency, or I will just corrupt myself.

32:11.680 --> 32:13.040
AARON That would be hysterically funny, yeah.

32:13.680 --> 32:18.160
I've been sent so many Harry's trial boxes because of all the different ads we've done

32:18.160 --> 32:19.680
across our different podcasts.

32:19.680 --> 32:23.600
I got essentially Final Fantasy VII Limit Break Omni Slash My Face Clean Off.

32:23.600 --> 32:29.520
GRIFFIN I could deliver a coup de grace to the final

32:29.520 --> 32:33.840
boss of my facial hair with these eight huge, awesome buster swords.

32:33.840 --> 32:36.160
AARON I used to have a buster sword.

32:36.160 --> 32:36.960
Y'all remember that?

32:36.960 --> 32:40.880
Dad got it for me for Christmas, and I used it to cut open a watermelon.

32:40.880 --> 32:43.520
I didn't clean it, and the buster sword got all rusty.

32:43.520 --> 32:45.680
That's what you get for not taking care of your weaponry.

32:45.680 --> 32:52.560
But Harry's is a great shave at a fair price, and they can send you their trial shave set

32:52.560 --> 32:57.040
for free if you go to sign up at harrys.com slash my brother, and you just pay three dollars

32:57.040 --> 32:58.080
for shipping.

32:58.080 --> 33:01.760
And it comes with a weighted ergonomic razor handle, five precision engineered blades with

33:01.760 --> 33:07.440
a lubricating strip and trimmer blade, a rich lathering shave gel, and a travel blade cover.

33:07.440 --> 33:10.320
If you want to get that free trial set, just go to harrys.com slash my brother right now.

33:10.320 --> 33:11.840
That's harrys.com slash my brother.

33:11.840 --> 33:16.160
Our next sponsor this week is Indochino.

33:16.160 --> 33:21.040
They are making it easy to get a perfectly tailored suit at an incredible price.

33:21.040 --> 33:24.960
You choose from hundreds of top quality fabrics and personalize your suit just the way you

33:24.960 --> 33:28.720
want it, whether it's for work, a wedding, or other special occasion.

33:28.720 --> 33:29.520
Here's how it works.

33:31.200 --> 33:34.000
You visit a showroom or you shop online at Indochino.com.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.800
You pick your fabric, you choose your customizations.

33:36.800 --> 33:38.560
Neon is very big.

33:38.560 --> 33:39.760
This is a good question.

33:39.760 --> 33:43.760
If you were going to personalize your suits, what would you do?

33:43.760 --> 33:44.800
Nice try, Travis.

33:44.800 --> 33:50.960
Ten breast pockets, ten interior pockets, two holsters, and a built-in backpack.

33:50.960 --> 33:55.360
I'm ready for the fucking road and whatever it has to throw at me because of my cool suit.

33:55.360 --> 33:57.440
But you forgot Griffin bulletproof lining.

33:58.560 --> 33:59.280
Did I forget it?

34:01.680 --> 34:02.720
Nice try.

34:02.720 --> 34:03.920
What kind of fabric do I want?

34:03.920 --> 34:04.960
Tactical.

34:04.960 --> 34:09.040
Submit your measurements, and then you place an order.

34:09.040 --> 34:10.240
John Wick 2 is so good.

34:11.120 --> 34:13.600
Yeah, John Wick 2, he went to Indochino.

34:14.400 --> 34:14.960
He did.

34:14.960 --> 34:15.840
As far as you know.

34:16.560 --> 34:20.640
And then he went and he said, Justin, who do you want me to kill?

34:20.640 --> 34:24.960
And I said, anybody that's keeping me from getting through these five fucking copy points.

34:26.800 --> 34:27.840
And he was like, are you sure?

34:27.840 --> 34:30.160
Because I think that's your- I said, you heard me, John Wick.

34:30.160 --> 34:32.960
Yeah, who's becoming Batman from LEGO Batman?

34:33.920 --> 34:34.800
Yeah, slowly.

34:34.800 --> 34:35.680
He doesn't talk a lot.

34:35.680 --> 34:37.200
It's hard to model an impression on John Wick.

34:37.200 --> 34:39.040
And then he was like, I need knives.

34:39.040 --> 34:42.160
And you turn him to Harry's and Harry's gave him just the sharpest

34:42.880 --> 34:48.320
ergonomic razor blades that you could use to attack common in a subway car.

34:48.320 --> 34:52.960
And then you place your order and you wait for it to arrive in just a few weeks.

34:53.760 --> 34:55.760
That's the Indochino experience.

34:55.760 --> 34:59.120
You can cobble the comprehension of the experience together.

34:59.120 --> 35:02.960
Hopefully throughout my brother's troenings this week, my listeners,

35:02.960 --> 35:05.440
my listeners, it says, and I'm going to keep with that.

35:05.440 --> 35:13.600
My listeners, the good eggs out there can get any premium Indochino suit for just $379.

35:13.600 --> 35:14.960
That's $379.

35:14.960 --> 35:21.760
Not the baffling alternative at Indochino.com while entering my brother at checkout.

35:21.760 --> 35:27.600

35:33.280 --> 35:38.320
That's Indochino.com promo code my brother for any premium suit.

35:38.320 --> 35:41.440
Just $379 and free shipping.

35:41.440 --> 35:44.240
And folks, listen, I'm being serious now.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.840
If you're going to get into a blade fight with common in a subway car,

35:47.840 --> 35:48.960
you got to go to Harry's.

35:48.960 --> 35:51.840
No, don't fight common, Griffin.

35:51.840 --> 35:53.760
He's been through enough.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.760
I'm not saying you should seek it out.

35:56.320 --> 36:00.640
But if you're on a subway car and you realize that you and common have wronged each other

36:00.640 --> 36:03.280
and that the Hitman society is not going to take you back in

36:04.640 --> 36:09.520
and the blade fights coming at you and there's nothing you can do to stop it,

36:10.080 --> 36:11.600
make sure you go to Harry's and get it.

36:11.600 --> 36:12.320
Here's my worry.

36:12.320 --> 36:15.200
My worry is that they'll get this new suit, Griffin, they'll put it on and be like,

36:15.200 --> 36:16.000
I feel great.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.680
I feel like I could conquer the world or go stab common like Griffin said.

36:19.680 --> 36:21.440
No, I'm not saying go stab common, Jesus Christ.

36:21.440 --> 36:22.960
I would never say anything like that.

36:22.960 --> 36:28.880
But if you're getting into an honorable blade fight with common in an enclosed space,

36:28.880 --> 36:30.320
Justin, did you leave?

36:31.040 --> 36:32.000
No, I'm still here.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.440
This is all great stuff.

36:33.440 --> 36:36.400
I just didn't want to risk, you know, throwing you guys off.

36:36.400 --> 36:39.440
Also, I just want to say a quick thank you to common for listening.

36:39.440 --> 36:40.240
Thank you, common.

36:40.240 --> 36:41.040
Thanks, common.

36:41.040 --> 36:42.720
You're an above average listener.

36:48.160 --> 36:48.660
Stupid.

36:49.680 --> 36:53.120
Here's your personal message for Lauren and Ma-

36:53.120 --> 36:54.480
What if he just went by great?

36:56.880 --> 36:57.440
Whoa.

36:57.440 --> 36:58.800
Oh, I was taking a drink of water.

36:58.800 --> 36:59.840
I almost died.

36:59.840 --> 37:00.340
Okay.

37:01.360 --> 37:02.560
Change his name.

37:02.560 --> 37:04.640
I got a big new announcement to make, everybody.

37:05.760 --> 37:07.040
I'm rare now.

37:07.040 --> 37:08.000
I'm uncommon.

37:08.000 --> 37:08.880
I'm rare.

37:08.880 --> 37:09.380
I'm epic.

37:10.800 --> 37:11.840
My name is epic.

37:12.560 --> 37:13.360
Legendary.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.600
You have to say it like that.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.040
There's 18 R's in it.

37:17.040 --> 37:18.320
It's legendary.

37:18.320 --> 37:19.440
Common, are you glowing?

37:21.760 --> 37:22.720
I am.

37:22.720 --> 37:24.720
My name is pre-order bonus.

37:24.720 --> 37:27.040
Yes, I'm DLC.

37:27.760 --> 37:30.640
I've changed my name to Malfurion Stormrage.

37:30.640 --> 37:32.160
Fuck yeah, that's an awesome name.

37:32.160 --> 37:32.660
Yeah.

37:33.120 --> 37:35.280
Did you hear that new Malfurion Stormrage track?

37:35.280 --> 37:36.880
It is pretty sick.

37:38.960 --> 37:42.080
So this is a personal message and it's for Lauren and Monica.

37:42.080 --> 37:44.960
And it's from Nat, but never Nate, who says,

37:45.760 --> 37:47.840
please keep sending in those Yahoo answers.

37:47.840 --> 37:49.680
Griffin needs your help more than I do.

37:49.680 --> 37:51.920
Y'all are good friends and the idea of a revenge

37:51.920 --> 37:55.040
Jumbotron seems like the perfect candle nights whenever gift.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.600
Always remember Obama's sunset amendments.

37:57.600 --> 38:00.080
Oh, and do me a favor and have a great week.

38:01.120 --> 38:01.840
That is nice.

38:01.840 --> 38:03.440
That is so sweet.

38:03.440 --> 38:08.400
I don't know if the revenge is against me or Nat, but never Nate.

38:08.400 --> 38:09.760
Nat, but never Nate sounds familiar.

38:09.760 --> 38:10.800
Have we had a Jumbotron?

38:10.800 --> 38:11.680
Let me check.

38:11.680 --> 38:12.640
The archive.

38:12.640 --> 38:13.840
We did 326.

38:15.200 --> 38:18.720
It's for Nat, but never Nate and it's from Laura and Monica.

38:19.600 --> 38:21.600
Okay, so kind of a twist.

38:21.600 --> 38:22.640
I knew it, I knew it.

38:22.640 --> 38:23.920
So this is our ARG.

38:24.880 --> 38:26.480
Have you found other plays?

38:26.480 --> 38:28.160
Yeah, this is good.

38:28.160 --> 38:32.640
I mean, every time y'all sort of attack each other like this,

38:32.640 --> 38:34.480
we make like a hundred dollars or something.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.480
So please keep this beef a stewing

38:37.360 --> 38:38.800
and thank you for the sweet message.

38:38.800 --> 38:40.400
Somebody else wanna read this other one?

38:40.400 --> 38:44.320
Yeah, it's from Libby and it's for Adam Gardner.

38:44.880 --> 38:46.960
It says happiest of happy birthdays.

38:46.960 --> 38:50.480
I love you more than the Yule dogs Christmas special

38:50.480 --> 38:51.760
and rainbow sprinkles.

38:51.760 --> 38:54.400
Let's eat a sleeve of birthday cake Oreos,

38:54.400 --> 38:58.240
play some Twilight Struggle and watch Fast Five today.

38:58.240 --> 38:59.040
You the best.

38:59.600 --> 39:02.320
That sounds like such a fucking nice day, honestly.

39:02.320 --> 39:04.480
That's that I'm like jealous by,

39:04.480 --> 39:06.560
and it's not just because yesterday was my cheat day

39:06.560 --> 39:09.280
and I couldn't do that if I wanted to until Saturday,

39:09.280 --> 39:11.680
but it still sounds like a really nice day regardless.

39:11.680 --> 39:13.680
Watching a video now called Yule dogs

39:13.680 --> 39:15.840
and I'm wondering if this is like something

39:15.840 --> 39:19.280
in the earbuds region.

39:19.280 --> 39:22.480
Oh, this is just like some nice piano holiday music

39:22.480 --> 39:25.280
and two dogs sitting down in front of a Christmas tree.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.960
So it's 23 minutes long.

39:26.960 --> 39:30.080
So I'm gonna sort of, I guess pop off for a little bit

39:30.080 --> 39:32.400
and I'll catch you guys on the next podcast.

39:35.600 --> 39:36.560
I'm Hal Loveland.

39:36.560 --> 39:37.440
I'm Danielle Radford.

39:37.440 --> 39:38.480
I am Michael Eagle.

39:38.480 --> 39:40.080
And we are the hosts of tights and fights,

39:40.080 --> 39:41.680
Maximum Fund's newest podcast

39:41.680 --> 39:43.840
dedicated to all things wrestling.

39:43.840 --> 39:45.440
We'll be talking about Sasha Banks,

39:45.440 --> 39:47.680
the women's revolution, Sasha Banks,

39:47.680 --> 39:50.160
the brand split and Sasha Banks' wigs.

39:50.160 --> 39:52.480
And we'll also be talking about wrestler fashion.

39:52.480 --> 39:54.480
Some wrestlers wear too many clothes.

39:54.480 --> 39:56.320
Some wrestlers don't wear enough clothes at all.

39:56.320 --> 39:59.760
And I'll be doing impressions of all your favorite wrestlers.

39:59.760 --> 40:02.640
New episodes, Thursdays on Maximum Fund

40:02.640 --> 40:04.640
or wherever you get your podcasts.

40:04.640 --> 40:06.080
Oh yeah, dig it.

40:06.080 --> 40:20.320
What are the biggest fond do and fond don'ts

40:20.320 --> 40:22.320
of having a cheese party?

40:22.320 --> 40:24.960
That's from Crushing Curds in Kirksville.

40:24.960 --> 40:27.760
And let me just say, you've come to the right place.

40:27.760 --> 40:28.800
Oh, have they?

40:30.320 --> 40:35.040
I'll say the first one is you don't say the word fond don'ts

40:35.040 --> 40:38.720
at any point during the party or you will be asked to leave.

40:38.720 --> 40:39.920
This is serious business.

40:40.880 --> 40:41.840
It's not a time for jokes.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.680
There's a lot of hot cheese being flung around

40:43.680 --> 40:45.760
and you need to keep your fucking wits about you.

40:45.760 --> 40:46.400
This is true.

40:46.400 --> 40:47.440
I think the number one thing,

40:47.440 --> 40:51.040
and this is so often followed by the wayside, is safety.

40:51.040 --> 40:52.160
I think it's the number one.

40:52.160 --> 40:54.160
Are your sticks long enough?

40:54.160 --> 40:57.520
Cause you don't want to get like your sweater sleeves in the cheese

40:57.520 --> 40:59.360
and then you're flinging the cheese around

40:59.360 --> 41:01.360
when you're gesturing telling your story

41:01.360 --> 41:03.680
about something that happened in accounts payable.

41:03.680 --> 41:06.800
So you want to use long enough skewers.

41:08.320 --> 41:09.120
Long skewers.

41:10.720 --> 41:13.280
Don't punch your whole fist into the cheese.

41:13.280 --> 41:16.320
Yeah, that's a rookie first kind of stick.

41:16.320 --> 41:19.360
Don't punch your whole fist in the cheese

41:19.360 --> 41:21.680
and then wandering around asking people if they want a bite.

41:22.720 --> 41:24.480
It's poor form.

41:24.480 --> 41:28.480
But if you do, do make sure you say smack-a-doodle and not bite.

41:28.480 --> 41:30.560
That does make it slightly less gauche.

41:30.560 --> 41:32.240
Here's something that I learned

41:32.240 --> 41:35.280
when I received a fondue pot as a gift.

41:35.280 --> 41:37.360
From me, so be tender.

41:37.360 --> 41:40.640
I'm just saying it was from me and Rachel, so be tender.

41:40.640 --> 41:42.560
No, this is not that fondue pot.

41:42.560 --> 41:43.280
This was my first one.

41:43.280 --> 41:45.840
Oh fuck, why didn't you say you got multiple fondue pots?

41:45.840 --> 41:47.280
Now I feel like a big asshole.

41:47.280 --> 41:49.280
The answer will become clear in a moment.

41:49.920 --> 41:52.080
If you find yourself with a fondue pot

41:52.080 --> 41:55.760
and you don't have special cheese for that,

41:56.560 --> 41:58.960
do not assume that you can just throw quote,

41:58.960 --> 42:01.040
whatever fucking cheese you want in there,

42:01.040 --> 42:02.320
because that is a pretty,

42:02.320 --> 42:05.280
it does solve the problem of having a fondue pot.

42:05.280 --> 42:07.680
Because if you try to throw sprinkle cheese,

42:07.680 --> 42:09.600
sprinkle mozzarella cheese in there,

42:09.600 --> 42:12.400
that's pretty much the end of that sort of fondue experience.

42:12.400 --> 42:14.160
So you're back to having one.

42:14.160 --> 42:14.880
Just the one.

42:14.880 --> 42:17.280
I was at zero, but I had one,

42:17.280 --> 42:20.320
and then I threw a bunch of fucking pizza cheese in there,

42:20.320 --> 42:22.480
and then I was at zero after that.

42:22.480 --> 42:25.040
And then you brought me back up to one for my tally.

42:25.040 --> 42:26.880
God, I'm so glad, I'm so glad I could,

42:26.880 --> 42:27.920
you should have told me that story.

42:27.920 --> 42:29.360
I would have felt better about the gift.

42:29.360 --> 42:30.640
I felt okay about that.

42:30.640 --> 42:31.760
While I was buying it for you,

42:31.760 --> 42:33.760
I was like, I don't know about this one,

42:33.760 --> 42:36.640
but if I had known I was filling a really specific need,

42:38.320 --> 42:41.360
affording you a valuable second chance,

42:41.360 --> 42:42.960
a second lease on life,

42:42.960 --> 42:44.240
I would have felt pretty good about it.

42:45.520 --> 42:48.240
There is a, this is somewhat related,

42:48.240 --> 42:50.160
because fondue can be chocolate too.

42:51.120 --> 42:53.040
I don't know if you've ever had a fondue

42:53.040 --> 42:55.840
can be chocolate too, basically.

42:56.480 --> 43:01.920
And I took my daughter to Golden Corral yesterday

43:01.920 --> 43:03.600
for breakfast, because it was-

43:03.600 --> 43:05.680
Because you were, she did bad in school

43:05.680 --> 43:06.800
and you were punishing her.

43:08.400 --> 43:09.680
It was cheat day, and I thought,

43:09.680 --> 43:11.520
if I'm gonna cheat, I'm gonna fucking cheat.

43:11.520 --> 43:13.760
If I'm gonna cheat, I'm taking my daughter down with me.

43:14.800 --> 43:16.480
In that sense, the Golden Corral

43:16.480 --> 43:18.800
is essentially the game genie of food.

43:18.800 --> 43:23.120
They got all the codes.

43:23.120 --> 43:26.960
Except it's the complete opposite of infinite life.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
It's the prima strategy guide.

43:30.000 --> 43:36.240
They have a chocolate fountain at the Golden Corral,

43:36.240 --> 43:39.520
even, I should mention, at 9.30 in the morning,

43:40.240 --> 43:42.160
which is like, it seems like a lot.

43:42.800 --> 43:45.120
And the, okay.

43:45.120 --> 43:47.360
So when you go to the chocolate fountain,

43:47.360 --> 43:49.680
there are a few different options for you.

43:49.680 --> 43:51.680
You can dunk a strawberry.

43:51.680 --> 43:54.880
You can dunk a small Rice Krispie treat

43:54.880 --> 43:57.040
and you can dunk a marshmallow.

43:57.040 --> 44:01.200
But the chocolate they're using is extremely liquidy, right?

44:01.200 --> 44:02.560
It's just like liquid chocolate.

44:02.560 --> 44:04.560
It's not like it hardens instantly.

44:04.560 --> 44:09.840
So if you put it on, if you do the enrobing process

44:09.840 --> 44:12.640
and then you put it on your plate full of other vittles,

44:12.640 --> 44:15.600
it will turn the entire thing into a chocolate new mess.

44:15.600 --> 44:19.360
So really the only option that Golden Corral has afforded you

44:20.080 --> 44:23.600
is to just stand next to the chocolate fountain

44:24.480 --> 44:27.520
and dunk in a marshmallow and then just eat it there

44:27.520 --> 44:29.920
like some big, terrible animal.

44:29.920 --> 44:32.640
And that's really the only option you have.

44:32.640 --> 44:35.040
Hold on, Justin, because there's always the option to not.

44:35.600 --> 44:36.960
Okay, it's a chocolate fountain.

44:36.960 --> 44:38.880
So that actually is not an option.

44:38.880 --> 44:40.960
But thank you, Travis, for your participation.

44:40.960 --> 44:41.840
Fair enough.

44:41.840 --> 44:47.200
I just think it's very dehumanizing is what I would say.

44:47.200 --> 44:49.200
Would they let you at Golden Corral

44:49.200 --> 44:51.760
just scoop up a bowl of the chocolate fountain

44:51.760 --> 44:54.160
just to take back to the table, maybe for the table,

44:54.160 --> 44:55.920
an order of chocolate for the table?

44:55.920 --> 45:01.280
So your thing is they make an amazing like feet,

45:01.280 --> 45:02.800
like a chocolate fountain,

45:02.800 --> 45:08.480
and you just dunk a bowl in it and take it back to the table

45:08.480 --> 45:10.640
so you can dunk it in chocolate there.

45:10.640 --> 45:12.640
That's not an experience, Travis.

45:12.640 --> 45:14.160
What you described is nothing.

45:14.160 --> 45:15.840
That's not, that's nothing.

45:15.840 --> 45:16.720
That's avarice.

45:17.520 --> 45:20.480
It has nothing to do with the magic of a chocolate fountain.

45:20.480 --> 45:22.560
Do you think there exists a restaurant

45:22.560 --> 45:25.200
where it's just like there are chocolate fountains

45:25.200 --> 45:26.720
at every table and it's just like,

45:26.720 --> 45:28.400
we know exactly what you want.

45:28.400 --> 45:30.080
We know why you came here.

45:30.080 --> 45:32.880
You're describing like maculagula,

45:32.880 --> 45:37.040
like you're describing like an opulent experience

45:37.040 --> 45:38.880
that sounds like a little much.

45:38.880 --> 45:40.880
How about a Yahoo?

45:40.880 --> 45:43.600
Sure, yeah, sounds good.

45:43.600 --> 45:45.440
I have a lot of, I have a lot of them

45:46.160 --> 45:48.000
and I don't know if all of them will,

45:48.000 --> 45:51.600
also all of these pages literally just crashed simultaneously

45:51.600 --> 45:55.120
because of a Shockwave plugin that went sort of sour.

45:55.120 --> 45:56.000
I'm curious.

45:57.200 --> 45:58.720
It's a very curious thing.

45:59.520 --> 46:00.880
Yeah, some of them are just gone.

46:00.880 --> 46:01.760
Okay, fun.

46:01.760 --> 46:02.880
I love this website.

46:02.880 --> 46:04.720
Well, see, you were worried about having too many

46:04.720 --> 46:06.160
so they took care of it for you.

46:06.160 --> 46:06.800
Yeah, thank you.

46:06.800 --> 46:08.480
Here's one, another one from Seth Carlson.

46:08.480 --> 46:10.960
It's Yahoo Answers user Simon asks,

46:10.960 --> 46:15.200
can or is our galaxy just an eye in a giant's face?

46:15.200 --> 46:17.280
Has science proved this wrong?

46:18.080 --> 46:19.200
Wait, what?

46:19.200 --> 46:23.520
Can or is our galaxy just an eye in a giant's face?

46:23.520 --> 46:25.200
Has science proved this wrong?

46:25.200 --> 46:26.000
Cool.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.440
We never left the galaxy.

46:27.440 --> 46:29.840
So the answer to that is of course no.

46:31.440 --> 46:34.080
I like whenever someone writes a question

46:34.080 --> 46:38.400
and they think I can't decide which word

46:38.400 --> 46:40.560
is the right way to start this sentence.

46:40.560 --> 46:41.360
I'll do both.

46:41.360 --> 46:42.800
I'm gonna leave both in for now

46:42.800 --> 46:45.760
and make sure I edit it before I click publish.

46:45.760 --> 46:47.200
No, we don't have to talk about this one.

46:47.200 --> 46:48.400
I just wanted to put that out there.

46:48.400 --> 46:50.480
People think about it if we're just living

46:50.480 --> 46:52.400
in one big spin and eye in a giant's face.

46:52.400 --> 46:54.000
Here's my question, Griffin.

46:54.000 --> 46:54.480
Okay.

46:54.480 --> 46:57.200
What would the difference be if we were or we weren't?

46:57.760 --> 46:59.840
How would that affect your day-to-day life

46:59.840 --> 47:02.560
if tomorrow like Neil deGrasse Tyson was like,

47:02.560 --> 47:04.480
we're all in the giant's eyeball?

47:04.480 --> 47:06.400
Would you be like, well, damn it?

47:06.400 --> 47:06.960
Yeah.

47:06.960 --> 47:10.400
Well, no, I mean, I'm not always thinking about myself, Travis.

47:10.400 --> 47:12.080
I would be thinking about the giant,

47:12.080 --> 47:14.400
like be fucking a little bit empathetic

47:14.400 --> 47:15.520
for once in your life.

47:15.520 --> 47:17.520
Do you think that that would make people care more

47:17.520 --> 47:19.520
about like global warming and pollution

47:19.520 --> 47:22.080
if it was like, this is probably pretty irritating

47:22.080 --> 47:22.720
for like his tear ducts?

47:22.720 --> 47:25.760
Yeah, maybe if the giant introduced themself.

47:25.760 --> 47:31.120
I'd be immediately start getting really anxious

47:31.120 --> 47:34.400
if the giant ever decided to finally go for LASIK,

47:35.040 --> 47:36.400
finally treat himself, you know,

47:36.400 --> 47:37.280
because I don't need that.

47:39.440 --> 47:40.000
Hold on.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.680
If he has a giant's eyeball,

47:41.680 --> 47:44.080
whenever we get into a space shuttle and fly into space,

47:44.080 --> 47:45.840
are we just doing inner space?

47:45.840 --> 47:47.680
We're flying deeper into the giant.

47:47.680 --> 47:48.640
I'm just saying.

47:48.640 --> 47:50.240
Wait, I'm not done talking about this, Griffin.

47:50.240 --> 47:50.800
I am.

47:50.800 --> 47:52.400
Here's another one from Aaron.

47:52.400 --> 47:54.240
Are we just doing Osmosis Jones?

47:54.240 --> 47:56.160
Are we all Osmosis Jones?

47:56.160 --> 47:58.400
Is this all just a Big Meat Dave?

47:58.400 --> 47:59.760
Holy shit.

47:59.760 --> 48:01.440
I didn't sign up for this, God.

48:02.560 --> 48:04.160
Which might be the name of the giant.

48:04.720 --> 48:06.720
Actually, it's pronounced Todd.

48:08.880 --> 48:10.720
Popular misconception.

48:11.280 --> 48:12.480
And so he is the giant.

48:13.200 --> 48:16.800
Fuck, now I'm accidentally lifting gags from the stupids.

48:16.800 --> 48:17.200
Yeah.

48:17.200 --> 48:18.160
How's my day going?

48:18.160 --> 48:19.280
Don't say accidentally,

48:19.280 --> 48:21.440
like you didn't reference the Lloyd

48:21.440 --> 48:24.000
in your license plate tweets.

48:24.000 --> 48:24.960
That's why I'm saying,

48:24.960 --> 48:27.520
like I did reference the Lloyd from the hit film.

48:27.520 --> 48:30.160
Hey y'all, if you haven't watched the stupids before,

48:30.160 --> 48:31.120
don't sleep on it.

48:31.120 --> 48:32.640
Do not sleep on this film.

48:32.640 --> 48:34.560
It is a grand slam.

48:34.560 --> 48:36.240
It's Bug Hall's finest work.

48:36.880 --> 48:37.600
Tom Arnold's.

48:38.240 --> 48:39.360
That is actually true.

48:39.360 --> 48:40.720
How about this one from Aaron Keese?

48:40.720 --> 48:42.160
I've been trying to read for 10 minutes

48:42.160 --> 48:43.760
and it's by Yahoo Answers user.

48:43.760 --> 48:45.120
They're anonymous, but they asked,

48:45.120 --> 48:49.440
would my nickname, Navy Bean, help me get in the Navy?

48:49.440 --> 48:50.160
Yes.

48:50.160 --> 48:51.840
It's a small thing, but details matter.

48:51.840 --> 48:53.360
They say put everything on a resume.

48:53.360 --> 48:54.400
I got this in high school.

48:54.400 --> 48:55.520
I graduated this year.

48:55.520 --> 48:56.880
I don't know why I got this name.

48:56.880 --> 48:58.880
Just because I eat Navy Bean soup,

48:58.880 --> 49:00.160
can I use this to my advantage?

49:00.160 --> 49:01.760
Will it help me become a SEAL?

49:01.760 --> 49:03.440
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

49:03.440 --> 49:06.320
You can't say, I don't know why I got this name.

49:06.320 --> 49:10.160
And then explain it in one, two, three, four, five, six words.

49:10.960 --> 49:12.400
Because I eat Navy Bean soup.

49:13.680 --> 49:15.600
I stepped away from this Yahoo Answers

49:15.600 --> 49:17.200
to ask some friends and then came back

49:17.200 --> 49:18.720
and finished the question.

49:18.720 --> 49:20.560
So says here, you wanna be a general?

49:20.560 --> 49:22.000
Like you wanna start out at a general?

49:22.000 --> 49:22.720
Yeah, that's right.

49:22.720 --> 49:26.320
Did you take like JROTC or like, nope.

49:26.320 --> 49:27.440
Do you even know what we do here?

49:27.440 --> 49:28.560
I don't know, boats and stuff.

49:29.120 --> 49:31.120
Cause we don't have generals in the Navy.

49:31.120 --> 49:32.720
Yeah, what do you think you're doing?

49:32.720 --> 49:34.400
Read the name, read the resume.

49:34.400 --> 49:35.680
Oh, shit.

49:37.040 --> 49:38.560
You're hired, sir.

49:38.560 --> 49:41.200
I like this concept, Griffin, in this question.

49:41.920 --> 49:45.440
And I would like to extend it to other job opportunities.

49:46.240 --> 49:47.200
Okay.

49:47.200 --> 49:48.240
How do you mean?

49:48.240 --> 49:50.560
Like what nickname, like if you,

49:51.440 --> 49:52.800
if you like called yourself like,

49:52.800 --> 49:55.440
like Dr. Good Hands,

49:55.440 --> 49:58.640
would that help you get into like the medical profession?

49:58.640 --> 49:59.600
You know what I mean?

49:59.600 --> 50:00.400
Let me hit you with this.

50:01.440 --> 50:03.440
Famous celebrity movie star walks into the,

50:04.240 --> 50:06.480
to the like army recruiting offices and says here,

50:06.480 --> 50:08.000
you wanna be a general?

50:08.000 --> 50:10.080
So I'll do redo the bit we just did.

50:10.080 --> 50:11.840
I'll take a different take of the scene.

50:11.840 --> 50:12.480
Yeah, that's right.

50:12.480 --> 50:13.920
I wanna be a, what is, son,

50:13.920 --> 50:15.840
what do you know about being in armies?

50:17.280 --> 50:19.920
Do you have any training to be in the armies?

50:19.920 --> 50:22.560
And this famous person is like, no.

50:22.560 --> 50:25.280
And like, well, what do you know?

50:25.280 --> 50:28.000
It says, look at my name and it's Armie Hammer

50:28.000 --> 50:29.920
from the Facebook movie.

50:29.920 --> 50:30.420
Yeah.

50:31.600 --> 50:32.960
I think that's hysterical.

50:35.360 --> 50:35.920
Oh, shit.

50:35.920 --> 50:37.840
I laughed when you said you thought it was hysterical.

50:37.840 --> 50:41.840
So I'm apparently incredibly susceptible to persuasion.

50:42.560 --> 50:43.600
All right, so not that Yahoo.

50:43.600 --> 50:44.480
How about this one?

50:44.480 --> 50:45.440
I forget who was sent in by,

50:45.440 --> 50:46.720
cause this fucking website crashed

50:46.720 --> 50:48.000
because it's a piece of dog shit.

50:48.000 --> 50:48.960
Hold on.

50:48.960 --> 50:51.360
It's from, yeah, Drew Davenport.

50:51.360 --> 50:52.400
Yeah, level 9,000.

50:52.400 --> 50:53.440
This is level, thank you.

50:54.160 --> 50:56.480
It's by Yahoo Answers user fishingforstars

50:56.480 --> 51:00.320
who says, doing a mini play based on an episode of Frasier.

51:00.880 --> 51:02.160
In my theater class in high school,

51:02.160 --> 51:04.240
the upperclassmen became directors of mini plays

51:04.240 --> 51:05.920
that usually have about four to five characters

51:05.920 --> 51:07.520
and the play lasts for seven to 20 minutes.

51:08.160 --> 51:09.760
Lower classmen are the people in the play.

51:09.760 --> 51:11.920
I wanted to take an episode from a TV series.

51:13.440 --> 51:14.080
Sorry, fuck.

51:14.080 --> 51:15.440
I didn't read this sentence.

51:15.440 --> 51:20.080
I wanted to take an episode from a TV series called Frasier.

51:20.080 --> 51:23.760
Do you mean Frasier?

51:23.760 --> 51:25.440
And use the transcript for a play

51:25.440 --> 51:26.800
I would be directing in the fall.

51:26.800 --> 51:29.200
My Coffee with Niles is the name of the episode,

51:30.000 --> 51:31.600
season one, episode 24.

51:31.600 --> 51:32.000
Of course.

51:32.000 --> 51:32.880
Do you think I would be-

51:32.880 --> 51:34.800
That's gotta be a season finale, right?

51:34.800 --> 51:35.280
Gotta be.

51:35.280 --> 51:36.160
It's up there, I think.

51:36.960 --> 51:40.000
Do you think I would be allowed to take the transcript

51:40.000 --> 51:44.480
and use it while still giving credit to the writers slash show slash act?

51:46.000 --> 51:47.920
Based on what you know so far,

51:47.920 --> 51:50.400
do you think I could do that?

51:50.400 --> 51:55.600
So, I think, and I'm no legal expert,

51:56.320 --> 51:58.880
but I think this is where fair use comes in

51:58.880 --> 52:00.400
and you can do it,

52:00.400 --> 52:02.800
but you can't use any of the settings.

52:03.360 --> 52:05.840
So you gotta have the episode like take place on the moon

52:05.840 --> 52:08.960
or like in hell, something like that.

52:08.960 --> 52:11.120
But then all the dialogue can be exactly the same.

52:12.080 --> 52:13.760
So let's walk into this play.

52:13.760 --> 52:15.280
You hear that boom, boom, boom, boom.

52:15.280 --> 52:19.680
Hey, baby, I hear the blues are calling, toss salad and ham and cold cereal.

52:19.680 --> 52:20.080
Yeah.

52:20.080 --> 52:21.200
Change the food.

52:21.200 --> 52:21.440
Yeah.

52:21.920 --> 52:24.720
Hey, baby, I hear the blues are calling, ice cream.

52:27.840 --> 52:31.840
And then it starts, that song ends, and it starts.

52:31.840 --> 52:32.640
And here comes-

52:34.160 --> 52:35.040
Frials and Nazer.

52:35.760 --> 52:36.720
Frials and Nazer.

52:36.720 --> 52:42.960
Those are the tags you use on Tumblr to find, they're big in the fandom.

52:45.360 --> 52:50.320
Frials says, you know, I'm trying to get coffee with my brother,

52:50.320 --> 52:51.760
but where's a good place to do it?

52:51.760 --> 52:53.280
Cause we don't live in Seattle.

52:53.280 --> 52:54.240
He has to say that.

52:54.880 --> 52:56.720
There's gonna be some lines that are gonna have to be changed.

52:56.720 --> 52:58.880
Anything where like, in almost every line,

52:58.880 --> 52:59.760
they're gonna have to say like,

52:59.760 --> 53:02.560
I'm not a psychiatrist on the radio in Seattle.

53:02.560 --> 53:05.120
We live in a universe in which the radios never existed.

53:05.120 --> 53:06.560
What are you talking about?

53:06.560 --> 53:07.280
Yeah, yeah.

53:09.040 --> 53:11.440
The dad in this one is very congenial.

53:12.400 --> 53:13.920
He has two dogs.

53:13.920 --> 53:18.400
And Frazier had to move in with him because of problems Frazier was,

53:18.400 --> 53:20.400
or sorry, Nazer was having.

53:20.400 --> 53:21.200
Yeah.

53:21.200 --> 53:23.040
And Frials loves his wife very much.

53:23.040 --> 53:24.880
Can't stand their housekeeper.

53:24.880 --> 53:25.200
Yes.

53:27.040 --> 53:30.160
Let's see, they live on the moon or maybe in hell.

53:30.160 --> 53:31.120
Do you wanna stick with that?

53:31.120 --> 53:36.400
Yeah, here's the thing about my coffee with Frials though.

53:36.400 --> 53:37.040
Yeah.

53:37.040 --> 53:39.440
Is that this is a bottle episode.

53:40.000 --> 53:40.480
Oh shit.

53:40.480 --> 53:46.880
That is just Frials and Nazer talking to each other

53:47.600 --> 53:49.600
for the entire 22 minutes.

53:49.600 --> 53:52.480
Ah, good old fashioned Frazier two-hander.

53:52.480 --> 53:56.480
Can you imagine the world in which you're like,

53:57.440 --> 53:59.440
you're in the writers room on Frazier

53:59.440 --> 54:03.040
and somebody has the courage to stand up and say-

54:03.040 --> 54:04.320
The audacity even.

54:04.320 --> 54:07.440
This world we've created is too rich.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.360
There's too much going on on the periphery.

54:11.360 --> 54:15.120
What we have to do is take a laser-like focus

54:15.120 --> 54:18.080
on these two people that are basically the same person

54:18.640 --> 54:21.840
if you think about it and just talk.

54:21.840 --> 54:23.280
What are they doing?

54:23.280 --> 54:25.520
What's going on in their heads, right?

54:26.320 --> 54:27.600
What's going on for them?

54:27.600 --> 54:31.920
Yeah, but I think this is gonna adapt to the stage really well.

54:31.920 --> 54:34.800
And to be honest, in this version of Nazer,

54:35.600 --> 54:37.360
because it does take place in hell,

54:37.360 --> 54:40.000
they're pretty much all gonna be bottle episodes.

54:40.000 --> 54:40.560
Yes.

54:40.560 --> 54:42.000
If you think about it.

54:42.000 --> 54:43.280
Ooh, and it's the same.

54:43.280 --> 54:46.400
Okay, every episode is basically the same

54:46.400 --> 54:49.280
and you can see behind their eyes that they know it.

54:49.280 --> 54:50.960
And it's like, is this a rerun?

54:50.960 --> 54:52.720
And they're like, no, this is episode six.

54:52.720 --> 54:56.160
And it's just like, because they're trapped in a bottle,

54:56.160 --> 54:58.640
and it's just like, because they're trapped in an endless loop,

54:58.640 --> 55:00.240
like that's their torment.

55:00.240 --> 55:02.880
But like, they do act it differently every time,

55:02.880 --> 55:03.760
even though the dialogue is the same.

55:03.760 --> 55:05.360
It's so good, yeah.

55:05.360 --> 55:07.520
And now, one sort of lingering question

55:07.520 --> 55:10.000
is when you do distribute out the program

55:10.000 --> 55:12.640
to all of the school kids in the audience,

55:12.640 --> 55:15.360
do you credit yourself as Gelsy Cramer?

55:17.200 --> 55:19.200
God, that is an unfortunate name.

55:19.200 --> 55:20.480
It's a not great name.

55:20.480 --> 55:21.760
Yeah, I'll be the first one to admit it.

55:21.760 --> 55:23.280
Gelsy Cramer is a tough sort of...

55:23.280 --> 55:25.520
It's challenging.

55:25.520 --> 55:27.200
It's a challenging thing to go by.

55:27.200 --> 55:28.080
That's Common's new name.

55:28.720 --> 55:31.280
I bet he mispronounced it in a few auditions

55:31.280 --> 55:32.800
and then immediately had to follow up with,

55:32.800 --> 55:34.000
well, that's my time.

55:34.000 --> 55:35.120
Thanks, everybody.

55:35.120 --> 55:36.240
That's how we got the part.

55:36.240 --> 55:38.080
People saw how self-deprecating it could be.

55:38.080 --> 55:40.800
Hello, my name is Gelsy Cramer.

55:40.800 --> 55:43.280
And okay, you know what?

55:43.280 --> 55:45.520
I got another thing.

55:45.520 --> 55:48.480
So anyway, I guess I won't be playing Spiderman.

55:49.200 --> 55:50.080
Is that how you say it?

55:50.080 --> 55:50.960
Am I saying it right?

55:50.960 --> 55:51.680
Spiderman?

55:51.680 --> 56:00.160
I would love to play the role of Petra Parker in Spiderman.

56:00.160 --> 56:02.480
But unfortunately, I've said Gelsy Cramer

56:02.480 --> 56:05.280
and I don't think we're going to move forward.

56:05.280 --> 56:07.200
I'm so terribly embarrassed.

56:07.200 --> 56:09.360
There's scrambled eggs all over my face.

56:09.360 --> 56:10.800
Stop right there.

56:12.800 --> 56:13.360
You're in.

56:15.040 --> 56:16.000
Get off this stage.

56:16.000 --> 56:16.800
Come here, Cramer.

56:16.800 --> 56:17.520
Give me a hug.

56:17.520 --> 56:18.000
You're in.

56:18.560 --> 56:20.320
I'm about to make you a star, Cramer.

56:20.320 --> 56:24.720
Why do we talk about Frasier so fucking much?

56:24.720 --> 56:30.720
I've seen this show eight times.

56:30.720 --> 56:32.000
I don't get it.

56:33.120 --> 56:36.000
I don't understand why we talk about Frasier so much.

56:36.800 --> 56:37.840
I don't get it.

56:38.400 --> 56:40.240
Oh no, you pulled back the curtain

56:40.240 --> 56:42.560
and now we're going to fade away to oblivion.

56:42.560 --> 56:46.320
By all the metrics, this show is supposed to be excellent.

56:46.320 --> 56:49.200
I don't understand why we talk about Frasier so much.

56:49.200 --> 56:50.320
We're not talking shit.

56:51.040 --> 56:54.080
Maybe that's a better way to sum up our show.

56:54.080 --> 56:56.160
It's an advice show where they talk about Frasier

56:56.160 --> 56:57.360
way too fucking much.

56:59.760 --> 57:01.040
I just don't understand.

57:01.040 --> 57:02.320
I mean, I just don't get it.

57:02.320 --> 57:03.440
We talk about it constantly.

57:03.440 --> 57:06.560
I've seen nothing Frasier.

57:06.560 --> 57:08.400
Do you guys remember when he fell off the stage

57:08.400 --> 57:09.360
in that viral video?

57:10.800 --> 57:12.800
That's why we talk about it so much.

57:15.200 --> 57:16.720
He seemed to take it very well

57:16.720 --> 57:19.360
and he seemed to have a good sense of humor about it.

57:19.360 --> 57:20.320
Jesus Christ.

57:20.320 --> 57:21.920
Hey, let's stop the podcast.

57:21.920 --> 57:23.200
Yeah, this has been our podcast,

57:23.200 --> 57:24.160
my brother, my brother and me.

57:25.680 --> 57:27.600
Super quick, I'm going to be in Philadelphia

57:27.600 --> 57:29.040
doing a Sawbones show

57:30.320 --> 57:34.720
and I hope that you will come out and join me for that.

57:34.720 --> 57:37.120
It is going to be at the Trocadero Theater

57:37.120 --> 57:39.840
and it is July 16th at 2 p.m.

57:39.840 --> 57:41.600
So an early show, all ages.

57:41.600 --> 57:43.920
Tickets are 22 to 24 bucks

57:43.920 --> 57:48.880
and you can get those at bit.ly forward slash Sawbones Philly.

57:48.880 --> 57:50.560
I hope you will come out and see the show

57:50.560 --> 57:52.400
because it should be really fun

57:52.400 --> 57:53.680
and there's a few tickets available

57:53.680 --> 57:55.440
and I would love it if you would hop on those

57:55.440 --> 57:57.040
and just come say hey.

57:57.040 --> 57:58.160
And shortly thereafter,

57:58.160 --> 58:01.280
we will be doing our my brother, my brother and me live show

58:01.280 --> 58:04.080
and Adventure Zone live show at San Diego Comic Con.

58:04.960 --> 58:06.080
We will see you there.

58:06.080 --> 58:07.120
If you're going to be at the show,

58:07.120 --> 58:08.960
be sure to send questions in for my brother,

58:08.960 --> 58:09.760
my brother and me.

58:11.040 --> 58:13.440
Yeah, we're also going to, I believe Saturday,

58:13.440 --> 58:16.720
we're going to be at the first second booth

58:17.440 --> 58:19.280
promoting our upcoming graphic novel.

58:19.280 --> 58:21.360
We'll let you know the times and stuff so you can stop by.

58:23.120 --> 58:26.320
Yeah, we're excited to be at San Diego Comic Con

58:26.320 --> 58:27.200
and see everybody there.

58:28.160 --> 58:29.760
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

58:29.760 --> 58:30.720
for the use of our theme song,

58:30.720 --> 58:33.280
It's a Departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

58:33.280 --> 58:35.040
It's a really, really good album

58:35.040 --> 58:38.880
and I think you should just go listen to it right now.

58:38.880 --> 58:40.400
Like don't worry about what the final yahoo is,

58:40.400 --> 58:41.280
just like go get it.

58:41.280 --> 58:42.960

58:58.960 --> 59:02.400
Ooh, speaking of video stuff, at this year's E3,

59:02.400 --> 59:08.000
I joined Justin and Griffin on a floor tour at E3.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.720
We just had some fun goofing around as brothers.

59:10.720 --> 59:14.160
You can find that on the Polygon YouTube channel

59:14.160 --> 59:15.040

59:16.400 --> 59:17.200

59:18.000 --> 59:18.640
Yeah.

59:18.640 --> 59:19.520
Here's the final yahoo.

59:19.520 --> 59:21.120
It was sent in by Seth Carlson, crushed it.

59:21.120 --> 59:21.840
Thank you, Seth.

59:21.840 --> 59:25.120
Yahoo Answers user Atlas asks,

59:27.200 --> 59:31.600
is Elon Musk basically adult Jimmy Neutron?

59:35.040 --> 59:36.640
My name is Justin McElroy.

I'm Travis McElroy.

59:38.800 --> 59:40.080
This has been my brother, my brother, me.

59:40.080 --> 59:40.880
Kiss your dad.

59:40.880 --> 59:45.280
Square on the lips.

Listener supported.

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.720
What the is an interview?

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.400
I mean, I do not know.

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:11.840
That was Oscar-winning filmmaker Errol Morris.

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:14.960
I'm Jesse Thorne, host of NPR's Bullseye.

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:17.120
Allow me to introduce The Turnaround,

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:20.400
a new podcast series produced by Maximumfun.org

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:23.280
and presented with the Columbia Journalism Review.

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:26.720
Join me as I sit down with some of our greatest living interviewers
