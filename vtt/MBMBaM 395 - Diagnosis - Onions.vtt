00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:44.400
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna? Just say, hey I wanna. Just say, hey I wanna.

00:44.400 --> 00:47.360
Hello everybody and welcome, my brother, my brother, me, and advice from the modern era.

00:47.360 --> 00:51.040
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your miller's brother, Travis McElroy.

00:51.040 --> 00:54.320
Oh god, this is so loud. And I, should I not?

00:54.960 --> 00:59.040
Just bring it down. I don't have to do mine, like people know who I am and the heat that I bring,

00:59.040 --> 01:01.680
but I am the- Just do it, just like bring it down.

01:01.680 --> 01:07.680
I'm the sweet baby, Griffin. I wanna talk about, I had a kid.

01:08.320 --> 01:09.920
What? I wanna talk about that.

01:10.560 --> 01:14.720
I wanna talk about that for a second. Well, but see, I also had an important

01:14.720 --> 01:18.480
life event happen, I went on a cruise, and now I wanna talk about that.

01:18.480 --> 01:21.200
Well that's funny, because I had one I wanted to talk about.

01:21.200 --> 01:29.840
I started going to basketball camp, I don't have anything.

01:29.840 --> 01:33.440
I started going to basketball camp, and I didn't though, but that's a lie,

01:33.440 --> 01:37.200
but I just wanted to have one. I think I could be the impartial sort of third

01:37.200 --> 01:39.680
party here trying to decide of what's gonna be the better intro.

01:39.680 --> 01:44.960
Justin having another beautiful, beautiful child, or Travis having a second child,

01:44.960 --> 01:49.200
so to speak, that is the boat. The sea, his love of the ocean.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.600
Yeah, it's his second child. Let me think about this.

01:51.600 --> 01:55.440
Let me consider possibilities. Jokes for Justin's.

01:55.440 --> 01:59.120
Very sleepy, we probably got a lot of doo-doo humor,

01:59.760 --> 02:04.320
although I will say we could probably get some doo-doo humor out of the boat one too.

02:04.320 --> 02:10.000
I, this kid is just shitting all the time. Listen, guys-

02:10.000 --> 02:13.120
Now to be fair, after my time on the boat, I was also shitting all the time.

02:13.120 --> 02:16.880
Yeah, and Justin, I'm gonna have to stop you, because I haven't made a call yet.

02:16.880 --> 02:20.720
I got a way that it's, if we're talking doo-doo humor versus doo-doo humor,

02:21.280 --> 02:24.000
it sounds like I gotta figure out which one's gonna be the richest vein,

02:24.000 --> 02:28.400
and I'm leaning towards boat. I'm leaning towards a boat over child.

02:28.960 --> 02:32.960
What I love about that is that I don't have to talk.

02:32.960 --> 02:33.680
Yes.

02:33.680 --> 02:39.520
The onus is removed from me to have a great bit about fatherhood,

02:39.520 --> 02:44.160
which honestly, the mind, here's one that dads won't say.

02:44.160 --> 02:48.400
Say, honey, if you're listening to this in the future, Cooper,

02:48.400 --> 02:51.120
daddy's gonna brag on you a little bit, and you're probably gonna be embarrassed,

02:51.120 --> 02:53.600
so skip ahead a few minutes. Are you done listening?

02:53.600 --> 02:55.520
Okay, good. What have I done?

02:55.520 --> 02:55.840
Yeah.

02:55.840 --> 02:59.440
I've made such a massive error in judgment.

02:59.440 --> 02:59.760
There's two.

02:59.760 --> 03:04.000
I already had a child, so I had that life experience.

03:04.000 --> 03:04.240
Yeah.

03:04.960 --> 03:09.280
I don't know why I thought, what was I trying to prove?

03:09.280 --> 03:10.080
You ticked that box, Justin.

03:10.080 --> 03:11.600
I don't know who I was trying to prove something.

03:11.600 --> 03:12.480
Why did you go back?

03:12.480 --> 03:14.640
Yeah, the box was done ticked.

03:14.640 --> 03:16.400
I guess I wanted one in reserve.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.200
You know, a burner, kid, just in case.

03:19.200 --> 03:19.760
Jesus.

03:20.320 --> 03:25.200
I don't know why I thought I could do this again.

03:25.200 --> 03:26.400
I'm an old man.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.160
You know, that's so funny you mentioned that, Justin.

03:28.160 --> 03:30.880
I felt the same way whenever I'd go back to the buffet

03:30.880 --> 03:33.440
and get a second plate of food, and it's like, what am I even doing?

03:33.440 --> 03:34.560
Oh, on the boat?

03:34.560 --> 03:36.080
Yeah, why did I go back?

03:36.080 --> 03:37.680
I've already eaten enough food, you know?

03:37.680 --> 03:40.080
And then you're finished like, oh, why did I do that?

03:40.080 --> 03:41.600
I love the boat humor.

03:41.600 --> 03:49.200
At basketball camp, Dr. Jeremy Dunks, who's the camp counselor,

03:50.480 --> 03:52.720
taught us all jumping.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.040
I think it's boats.

03:55.040 --> 03:56.000
I think it's boats.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.360
I think it might be boats.

03:57.360 --> 03:58.240
Boats, yes.

03:58.240 --> 04:01.040
So Captain Travis, how-

04:01.040 --> 04:02.880
It's actually Commodore.

04:02.880 --> 04:04.400
Commodore, Travis, how were the high seas?

04:04.400 --> 04:08.960
It's actually Commodore, Ron Jemen, Jay Meriwether, gentlemen, privateer.

04:08.960 --> 04:10.320
That's nothing.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.400
I'm just going to call you Captain Trav.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.000
The J stands for Joshua now.

04:15.040 --> 04:19.760
How was the waves and the whales and all the fish and-

04:19.760 --> 04:22.400
The ship was a rockin' and a rollin'.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.600
Can I sleep?

04:23.600 --> 04:28.400
For this part, I did have a long con kind of cookup

04:28.400 --> 04:32.400
where I was going to tell my wife, oh, we got a long sesh today,

04:32.400 --> 04:34.640
recording for two hours, trying to get one in the can

04:34.640 --> 04:37.040
and then take a nap on the floor of my office.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.760
That was kind of one scam I was sort of thinking about running.

04:39.760 --> 04:41.520
Well, Justin, I'm going to give you a ticket

04:41.520 --> 04:43.760
and it's for 90 seconds of sleepy time

04:43.760 --> 04:46.160
and something tells me you're going to use each and every one of them.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.200
So you go ahead and do that

04:47.200 --> 04:50.080
and Travis is going to tell me all of his fun boat adventures.

04:50.720 --> 04:53.440
Can he guarantee before you give him that permission slip

04:53.440 --> 04:55.760
that something funny did happen on the boat?

04:55.760 --> 04:57.120
Several funny things happened.

04:57.120 --> 04:57.920
Thank you for asking.

04:57.920 --> 05:00.000
Okay, now is this just going to be you bragging

05:00.000 --> 05:02.560
about how you met all the hot stars?

05:02.560 --> 05:02.880
Yes.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.840
Well, then I'm not interested in that anymore.

05:05.840 --> 05:07.600
No, but it'll be interesting though also.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.360
Well, no, you're just going to drop a bunch of names

05:09.360 --> 05:11.200
and now I'm wondering if maybe me and Justin

05:11.200 --> 05:13.280
should overrule you and go to basketball camp.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.880
Well, let me try this one on for size

05:14.880 --> 05:16.640
and this will give you a kind of a taste of my stories.

05:16.640 --> 05:18.000
Do I still get the nap with the basketball camp?

05:18.000 --> 05:19.200
Yes, Justin, absolutely.

05:19.200 --> 05:19.360
Okay.

05:20.880 --> 05:23.520
The first day I was having a conversation with Wil Wheaton.

05:23.520 --> 05:25.920
Okay, see, and you were fucking four seconds in.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.120
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.560
Well, you made me a promise.

05:28.560 --> 05:31.280
On the first day I was having a conversation with someone.

05:31.840 --> 05:32.880
But I know who it is.

05:32.880 --> 05:33.920
You already said-

05:33.920 --> 05:35.600
Someone from Star Trek.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.760
Someone from Star Trek and Big Bang Theory

05:37.760 --> 05:40.880
and Tabletop on YouTube and Keegan Sundry.

05:40.880 --> 05:43.200
And we're just casually on the ground

05:43.200 --> 05:46.400
and this person just casually gestures towards the water

05:46.400 --> 05:47.840
and goes, there's a whale.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.920
And it was very bizarre

05:49.920 --> 05:52.400
and not a moment you expect to ever have in your life.

05:52.400 --> 05:53.920
Just randomly having a conversation

05:54.480 --> 05:55.760
and then like there's a whale

05:55.760 --> 05:57.840
and swimming with the whale with some dolphins

05:57.840 --> 05:59.920
and it was fucking magical.

05:59.920 --> 06:02.000
And this person turned to this whale

06:02.640 --> 06:04.800
and did this bokkan and said, live long and prosper.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.000
But I can't say who it is.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.360
Can't say who it is.

06:07.360 --> 06:10.160
Cannot say who it was.

06:10.160 --> 06:10.720
That's funny.

06:10.720 --> 06:13.360
When I was at basketball camp,

06:14.560 --> 06:17.520
my bunkmate was Wharf.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.960
So it sounds like we all had our own

06:20.960 --> 06:22.560
little sort of great experiences there.

06:22.560 --> 06:23.680
We all had our own fun.

06:23.680 --> 06:25.600
There was also a day where we walked into

06:25.600 --> 06:27.280
one of the lounge areas

06:27.280 --> 06:29.120
and the crew, having a bit of fun,

06:30.000 --> 06:32.640
had made a bunch of towel animals in the area

06:32.640 --> 06:35.520
but it was all the monkeys that hang from coat hangers.

06:35.520 --> 06:39.200
And I don't think it was a lovely gesture.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.000
I love that they did it.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.280
I'm not complaining about that.

06:41.280 --> 06:44.000
But I don't know if they were trying to be unsettling

06:44.000 --> 06:45.440
but it definitely was.

06:46.160 --> 06:49.040
If Travis was worried that his cruise chat

06:49.040 --> 06:51.440
would be alienating to many of our listeners,

06:51.440 --> 06:54.320
I'm glad that he has graduated to complaining

06:54.320 --> 06:56.480
about the available towel animals.

06:57.360 --> 06:59.280
Anyways, the JoCo Cruise was great

06:59.280 --> 07:03.200
and JoCo Cruise 2019 is already available for booking.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.040
So we'll get on that.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.640
They Might Be Giants is gonna be there

07:06.640 --> 07:08.480
and I'm not even being paid to plug

07:08.480 --> 07:09.520
and it's not even guaranteed

07:09.520 --> 07:11.040
that I'll be on it again next year.

07:11.040 --> 07:13.360
I'm just a big fan of it and it was really great.

07:13.360 --> 07:14.880
And you should go do it.

07:14.880 --> 07:16.640
Based on the story you're telling

07:16.640 --> 07:20.560
of how you yelled at a bunch of whales with someone.

07:20.560 --> 07:21.120
With someone.

07:21.120 --> 07:22.480
We didn't yell at the whales.

07:22.480 --> 07:23.760
We gestured towards them.

07:24.800 --> 07:27.280
I think I know how Bill Beaton operates

07:27.280 --> 07:29.840
and you two were definitely just yelling obscenities

07:29.840 --> 07:30.880
at the whales.

07:30.880 --> 07:32.480
Justin, what about the birth?

07:32.480 --> 07:42.480
Was Worf there?

07:42.480 --> 07:44.240
Yes, carve the flesh.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.720
Retrieve the new child.

07:48.080 --> 07:48.640
Fight me.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.960
Fight your way out of the woman child.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.400
Get the baby a battle.

07:56.000 --> 07:56.400
Should we do-

07:56.400 --> 07:57.200
Carve his way out.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.160
Let's do questions.

07:58.880 --> 07:59.440
Yeah.

07:59.440 --> 08:00.480
Oh, hell yeah.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.320
Yeah, I got a question.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.200
What did I do?

08:03.200 --> 08:05.200
Yeah, should we mention the fact

08:05.200 --> 08:07.680
that Justin is operating on no hours of sleep

08:07.680 --> 08:09.040
and that is why we are getting

08:09.040 --> 08:11.120
this sort of fatalistic version?

08:11.120 --> 08:12.720
The last one slept.

08:12.720 --> 08:13.360
Yeah.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.560
For sure.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.960
But now that last one, Justin is old enough to be like,

08:16.960 --> 08:18.160
hey, what's up everybody?

08:18.160 --> 08:19.840
I don't wanna sleep anymore.

08:19.840 --> 08:22.000
And you also have a new one that doesn't wanna sleep.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.440
No, the new one is, the old one's like very chill

08:25.440 --> 08:27.760
and sleeping through the night in her own bed.

08:27.760 --> 08:28.320
It's amazing.

08:28.320 --> 08:29.680
She's a gift and a treasure

08:29.680 --> 08:30.960
and I didn't appreciate her enough.

08:32.560 --> 08:36.960
This new one just shits and then it yells about it

08:37.600 --> 08:41.120
and when my last baby, Charlie, cried,

08:41.120 --> 08:42.800
it was so pitiful.

08:42.800 --> 08:45.760
It was like, oh man, I gotta do something.

08:45.760 --> 08:48.000
When Cooper cries, it sounds like she's praying

08:48.000 --> 08:50.800
to an elder god for the strength to kill us.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.240
Just like, please give me the strength

08:52.240 --> 08:53.360
to smite these idiots.

08:53.360 --> 08:54.080
Yeah, sounds like-

08:54.080 --> 08:54.720
Hell yeah.

08:54.720 --> 08:56.000
Suck the kids.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.440
Sounds like maybe she's succeeding.

08:57.440 --> 09:04.160
Yes, well, slowly, not that slowly, but I teach some great English.

09:04.160 --> 09:05.680
Can we start with the third question here?

09:05.680 --> 09:07.520
Cause I can't wait to get to it.

09:07.520 --> 09:08.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.480
No, that's why I put it as third.

09:10.480 --> 09:11.200
Cause here's the thing.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.960
Can I pull back the curtain a little bit here

09:12.960 --> 09:14.080
on episode 395?

09:14.720 --> 09:18.800
On every week, I pick out six questions

09:18.800 --> 09:21.840
knowing we only ever get to three.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.640
I don't know why I continue to do six,

09:24.640 --> 09:27.200
but I guarantee if I just drop three on you two,

09:27.200 --> 09:28.480
you'd be like, wait, what?

09:28.480 --> 09:29.120
Where's the other?

09:29.760 --> 09:31.840
And so like, my third question is,

09:31.840 --> 09:33.680
oh, that's the club banger that's like-

09:33.680 --> 09:35.840
I know, but we need to get Justin hyphy

09:35.840 --> 09:38.560
and I feel like this question's gonna be the one that does it.

09:38.560 --> 09:39.680
I'm a consummate professional.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.680
When we start recording, I'm gonna be on.

09:41.680 --> 09:43.440
There's no more complaining about-

09:43.440 --> 09:46.080
Justin, we've been recording for the last 10 minutes.

09:46.080 --> 09:46.720
Yeah, for a while.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.320
Well then, here it comes.

09:48.320 --> 09:49.600
Pull up your baseball gloves,

09:49.600 --> 09:51.440
cause I got a hot pitch coming in.

09:53.840 --> 09:54.340
Perfect.

09:54.340 --> 09:56.820
My husband's name is Tim Allen.

09:57.540 --> 09:59.060
Yes, like the actor.

09:59.060 --> 10:02.100
Most of the time when we place a pickup order of some kind,

10:02.100 --> 10:02.900
we use his name.

10:03.940 --> 10:06.100
However, almost every time we go to the store

10:06.100 --> 10:06.820
to pick up the item,

10:06.820 --> 10:08.180
the cashier generally says,

10:08.180 --> 10:09.540
oh, like the tool man, right?

10:11.060 --> 10:12.500
Do you guys get that all the time?

10:12.500 --> 10:15.220
Do they do that in 2017-18?

10:15.220 --> 10:16.420
Oh, fuck my life.

10:17.140 --> 10:19.620
To which end up responding kindly?

10:19.620 --> 10:21.060
Yes, yes we do.

10:21.060 --> 10:23.380
Is there a better way to respond to these cashiers

10:23.380 --> 10:24.580
who always think they're the first one

10:24.580 --> 10:26.260
to make the joke about Tim Allen?

10:26.260 --> 10:28.420
How do I tell them to stuff it?

10:28.420 --> 10:29.780
I've already heard that one.

10:29.780 --> 10:31.620
Without being overly rude.

10:31.620 --> 10:33.860
That's from over it in Ohio.

10:33.860 --> 10:35.700
I think the best way is just to say like,

10:36.420 --> 10:36.980
wait, who?

10:38.020 --> 10:39.700
And make them explain it.

10:39.700 --> 10:41.540
Make them explain who Tim Allen is.

10:41.540 --> 10:44.260
Make them do a bullet point by bullet point

10:44.260 --> 10:47.060
plot recap of the entirety of Home Improvement.

10:47.060 --> 10:47.860
What, wait, what?

10:47.860 --> 10:49.620
His neighbors behind a fence

10:49.620 --> 10:50.980
and then different objects.

10:50.980 --> 10:53.060
You know, what is this show?

10:53.060 --> 10:54.100
Why don't you see his face?

10:54.100 --> 10:54.900
I don't understand.

10:54.900 --> 10:55.860
What's going on?

10:55.860 --> 10:58.740
And then the thing he was building just like explodes

10:58.740 --> 11:00.340
and he dies, I assume?

11:00.340 --> 11:01.700
No, he doesn't die.

11:01.700 --> 11:03.460
But they keep letting him make things?

11:03.460 --> 11:03.940
What?

11:03.940 --> 11:04.980
What are you talking about?

11:06.340 --> 11:08.820
Tell me more about the clown man, Al Borland.

11:10.660 --> 11:12.420
I want to dial into the clown man.

11:13.780 --> 11:15.540
In the future, when you see them again,

11:15.540 --> 11:17.220
ask them for updates.

11:17.220 --> 11:18.500
Ask how things are going.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.420
Tell me about the new Home Improvement.

11:20.420 --> 11:23.060
Tell me about the new Home Improvement that there is.

11:23.620 --> 11:25.700
And then when there is no more new Home Improvement,

11:25.700 --> 11:27.380
make them create new Home Improvement.

11:27.380 --> 11:27.940
There it is.

11:28.980 --> 11:31.540
What do you think they did after the finale

11:31.540 --> 11:32.980
and then just keep going from there?

11:32.980 --> 11:36.260
Speculative fan fiction and also my chilis to go.

11:36.260 --> 11:37.140
Thank you.

11:37.140 --> 11:38.100
I need both.

11:38.100 --> 11:39.860
And maybe your parents should have thought about this

11:39.860 --> 11:42.340
before they fucking tried to steal Tim Allen's identity.

11:43.460 --> 11:44.180
Thank you, Griffin.

11:44.740 --> 11:45.620
Just saying.

11:45.620 --> 11:48.900
Anytime a parent names a child the same thing

11:48.900 --> 11:50.500
as another person in the world,

11:51.060 --> 11:52.820
it is identity theft.

11:52.820 --> 11:55.060
And we gotta just, we gotta,

11:55.060 --> 11:57.300
nobody's talking about this in the media,

11:58.100 --> 12:00.980
the mainstream media, the lamestream media.

12:02.900 --> 12:07.620
Okay, so Home Improvement started in 1991, right?

12:08.180 --> 12:09.300
It's 2018.

12:10.180 --> 12:12.420
So it's very possible.

12:12.420 --> 12:14.980
I mean, the question doesn't say how old the husband is,

12:14.980 --> 12:19.140
but if it's, it could be if the husband is what,

12:19.940 --> 12:21.620
20, no, I'm not doing math correctly.

12:21.620 --> 12:23.060
How old would this person be?

12:23.060 --> 12:24.100
Yeah, 27, right?

12:24.100 --> 12:24.580
69.

12:25.860 --> 12:27.220
69, nice.

12:27.220 --> 12:29.860
But if they're 27 or younger,

12:31.220 --> 12:33.300
then it's very possible, yes,

12:33.300 --> 12:36.820
like the tool man is the correct answer to that question.

12:37.860 --> 12:40.020
I was named for the tool man.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.940
Yes, I was named for the tool man.

12:41.940 --> 12:44.900
I was named in honor of the tool man, my godfather.

12:44.900 --> 12:47.220
Could you say that, yes, that's me,

12:48.020 --> 12:49.460
Tim Allen from television.

12:51.780 --> 12:55.300
It's been a weird few years, but I am Tim Allen now.

12:55.300 --> 12:56.980
It's me, Tim Allen from Michigan.

12:58.020 --> 12:59.780
I have been passed on the mantle.

12:59.780 --> 13:02.500
I killed the last Tim Allen, and now I am Tim Allen.

13:03.860 --> 13:06.180
And I look like him, no matter what I do,

13:06.180 --> 13:09.700
I wake up every morning looking exactly like him, Tim Allen.

13:09.700 --> 13:12.820
Why does Buzz sound so different in Toy Story 4?

13:12.820 --> 13:13.700
Oh, you didn't hear.

13:13.700 --> 13:15.620
The Tim Allen was murdered.

13:16.900 --> 13:18.020
There's a new Tim Allen now.

13:18.020 --> 13:19.380
Now there is a new tool man.

13:20.180 --> 13:21.460
His name is Tim Allen.

13:23.220 --> 13:25.220
He also hates the Al Borland clown.

13:27.300 --> 13:29.140
Of course we're on the fourth Al Borland.

13:29.140 --> 13:30.100
It's worth noting.

13:32.340 --> 13:34.180
Should we mention that Tim Allen sucks?

13:34.740 --> 13:36.900
We haven't really talked about that yet.

13:36.900 --> 13:40.500
Well, I feel like we make jokes about people who are stinkers,

13:40.500 --> 13:41.460
and then people are like,

13:41.460 --> 13:43.540
hey, did you know that this person's a stinker?

13:43.540 --> 13:45.700
And the answer to that is yes.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.580
That's why we're punching up at Tim Allen.

13:48.580 --> 13:50.660
Yeah, so we can make jokes about him

13:50.660 --> 13:53.380
as long as we include a disclaimer that he sucks shit.

13:54.740 --> 13:56.260
You always go super hard.

13:56.900 --> 13:58.260
Travis, correct me if I'm wrong,

13:58.260 --> 13:59.460
but do you feel like,

13:59.460 --> 14:02.820
I'm not saying that Tim Allen sucks or doesn't suck, he does,

14:02.820 --> 14:04.980
but don't you feel like Griffin goes kind of like

14:04.980 --> 14:07.620
an incommensurate level of hard at Tim Allen

14:07.620 --> 14:09.140
whenever Tim Allen comes up?

14:09.140 --> 14:10.500
It feels very personal.

14:10.500 --> 14:15.140
No, I get that because I think Tim Allen was,

14:15.700 --> 14:18.900
as we all know, a huge hero of Griffin's for a long time,

14:18.900 --> 14:21.540
and then when it was revealed that Tim Allen sucked,

14:21.540 --> 14:24.340
I think it really hit Griffin in a pretty hard way.

14:24.340 --> 14:27.060
I think for Griffin, it is a good person.

14:27.060 --> 14:28.180
I mean, you knew me.

14:28.180 --> 14:29.620
I was going down the street.

14:29.620 --> 14:30.740
I was going to Blockbuster,

14:30.740 --> 14:35.300
and I would say, let me Brent Joe versus the Volcano.

14:35.860 --> 14:38.500
Let me get my, yeah, he was in that one, wasn't he?

14:38.500 --> 14:39.620
Or was that Tom Hanks?

14:39.620 --> 14:44.740
That was Tom Hanks, who rules for now, currently rules.

14:46.420 --> 14:49.380
I was talking about Jungle 2 Jungle,

14:49.380 --> 14:53.300
the Santa Claus, Santa Claus 1, 2, 3, all of them,

14:53.300 --> 14:57.860
and I had my t-shirt that says Tim Allen does it.

14:57.860 --> 14:58.660
Tim Allen's good.

14:58.660 --> 14:59.700
Tim Allen is good.

14:59.700 --> 15:10.980
And then he comes out and he calls me a snowflake

15:10.980 --> 15:15.700
and said that I personally got his bad show canceled,

15:15.700 --> 15:18.580
and I don't know how to respond to that

15:18.580 --> 15:23.220
except to go on my podcast and say, well, Tim Allen is not good.

15:23.220 --> 15:27.140
And in fact, he might suck shit.

15:27.140 --> 15:31.060
So what if I couch it like that?

15:31.060 --> 15:32.820
And he might suck shit?

15:32.820 --> 15:34.180
Tim, no, I'll say this.

15:34.180 --> 15:35.460
Tim Allen is not good.

15:37.380 --> 15:38.500
He may suck shit.

15:39.620 --> 15:40.980
He's in a quantum state.

15:42.980 --> 15:45.860
He could be sucking shit or he could not be sucking shit,

15:45.860 --> 15:48.660
and until we observe him, we will not know.

15:48.660 --> 15:51.860
What I love about that is that that is not a very PC thing to say,

15:51.860 --> 15:54.180
and so I think the man himself, the tool man,

15:54.180 --> 15:56.100
the former tool man would appreciate it.

15:56.100 --> 15:58.980
So did you know that the name of the Home Improvement theme

15:58.980 --> 16:05.300
is Iron John's Rock and not just the theme of Home Improvement?

16:05.300 --> 16:06.020
Fuck, Travis.

16:06.020 --> 16:06.740
Pure Michigan.

16:08.340 --> 16:09.860
Why did they name the theme?

16:10.820 --> 16:14.340
And for the life of me, I've been sitting here Googling furiously.

16:14.340 --> 16:16.820
I can't find out if it was called Iron John's Rock

16:16.820 --> 16:18.980
and then they used it for Home Improvement

16:18.980 --> 16:21.380
or if someone wrote the theme song to Home Improvement

16:21.380 --> 16:23.860
and said I'm also going to give it a title.

16:23.860 --> 16:28.100
Yeah, well, I've just written my 30-second long macadam opus.

16:28.100 --> 16:29.940
It's a shame no one's ever going to hear it.

16:29.940 --> 16:32.020
Who listens to 30-second songs anyway?

16:33.300 --> 16:37.300
I have a Yahoo here and this one sent me down a real deep oubliette

16:37.860 --> 16:41.460
and so I wanted to invite you guys down in the oubliette with me.

16:42.900 --> 16:48.980
It was sent in by Adrian Cowles and it's Yahoo Answers user Johnny who asked,

16:48.980 --> 16:54.900
in a real-life situation, can firefighter really pee on a small fire to get it out?

16:55.620 --> 16:58.980
And then, because game shows, you can't believe.

17:00.020 --> 17:00.500
Wait.

17:00.500 --> 17:04.580
I saw this and I was like, what the fuck is this person talking about?

17:04.580 --> 17:06.980
This is, this is nonsense.

17:07.540 --> 17:09.220
And then I kept going down the submissions

17:09.220 --> 17:11.780
and I found one that was sent in by the delivery man Seth Carlson.

17:12.980 --> 17:16.980
It's from Yahoo Answers user Johnny who asks again,

17:16.980 --> 17:21.860
family feud question, name something a firefighter do to put out small fire.

17:21.860 --> 17:25.860
That was question, the answer was pee, how is that possible?

17:27.060 --> 17:33.380
So it seems like on the feud, there was this, there was a thing, a category

17:33.380 --> 17:39.780
about things firefighters do to put out fires.

17:39.780 --> 17:43.860
And that's probably, Steve probably got to, what can a firefighter do to,

17:43.860 --> 17:49.140
what can a firefighter do to, and then one of the, you know,

17:49.140 --> 17:57.220
goblins that goes on that show just screams like, piss, Steve, like waiting for, piss, Steve, piss.

17:57.220 --> 18:00.340
Steve, they can piss on it.

18:00.340 --> 18:02.900
I want to say piss on TV, Steve, piss.

18:02.900 --> 18:06.420
And then he points to the board and it probably said something like wee-wee water.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.380
They can fart on it real hard, Steve.

18:09.380 --> 18:09.940
You fart on it?

18:09.940 --> 18:12.020
No, I'm sorry, that would actually make the fire bigger.

18:12.020 --> 18:14.180
The fire has sex with it.

18:14.180 --> 18:14.980
The fire?

18:14.980 --> 18:17.620
What is wrong with everyone on this show?

18:17.620 --> 18:18.580
Making whoopee.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.860
They can make whoopee with the fire, Steve.

18:24.900 --> 18:26.340
Let's see, 56%.

18:27.380 --> 18:29.940
So it pops up on the board and it says like asparagus.

18:29.940 --> 18:31.620
Pops up on the board.

18:31.620 --> 18:34.100
And it says like asparagus juice, human.

18:34.100 --> 18:37.460
Asparagus juice.

18:37.460 --> 18:41.300
And then it shows up there and is the right answer.

18:41.300 --> 18:45.860
And I'm wondering if that's based, I never saw Backdraft.

18:45.860 --> 18:51.620
I never saw Fireproof, the Kirk Cameron sort of religious vehicle.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.740
And I'm wondering if there's a scene in either,

18:54.740 --> 19:00.020
how did this sort of get injected into the public eye, the public consciousness?

19:00.020 --> 19:02.580
That if there was a very small fire, when you're a firefighter, you don't just-

19:02.580 --> 19:03.140
How small?

19:03.940 --> 19:04.980
Like a match?

19:04.980 --> 19:09.460
Yeah, I mean, if you're a firefighter and you see a small fire,

19:09.460 --> 19:11.780
I think you know that that can turn into a big fire

19:11.780 --> 19:14.180
and that can be a big, dangerous situation.

19:14.180 --> 19:17.300
And so you see a small one, you go out to a fancy restaurant,

19:17.300 --> 19:19.060
and there's a bunch of lit candles all over the place.

19:19.060 --> 19:20.900
And you're like, ugh, God, not again.

19:22.260 --> 19:23.860
Wee-wee water, does it happen then?

19:23.860 --> 19:24.660
Probably not.

19:24.660 --> 19:26.580
Here's the thing, you're looking at two different,

19:26.580 --> 19:29.700
two different questions really, Griffin, because can it, right?

19:29.700 --> 19:33.140
So there has to be a window of size of fire

19:33.860 --> 19:36.500
where it's too big to stamp out,

19:36.500 --> 19:40.100
but small enough that you think a bladder full

19:40.100 --> 19:42.100
could accomplish the task.

19:42.100 --> 19:44.180
And I do think you could find that window.

19:44.180 --> 19:46.340
But I think the other side of the question is,

19:46.340 --> 19:49.300
is there a flap of sorts?

19:49.300 --> 19:52.820
Is there some kind of mechanism in the fire person suit

19:52.820 --> 19:54.820
that would even allow for such a thing?

19:55.700 --> 19:56.980
Yeah, that's a great question, Travis.

19:56.980 --> 19:58.420
Thank you, thank you, Travis.

19:58.420 --> 20:00.260
I hadn't even considered that part of it.

20:01.860 --> 20:03.220
But the answer is yes.

20:03.220 --> 20:06.260
There's a little fireproof flap, kind of like how

20:06.260 --> 20:09.140
old-timey kids had it on the back of their pajamas.

20:09.140 --> 20:10.500
Hey, was that for shitting?

20:11.220 --> 20:12.020
Yes.

20:12.020 --> 20:13.620
Yeah, it was for shitting.

20:13.620 --> 20:15.460
What else would that be for, Griffin?

20:15.460 --> 20:16.820
Like, cute.

20:16.820 --> 20:17.780
Tattooing?

20:17.780 --> 20:18.900
No, like cute.

20:18.900 --> 20:23.700
Like, uh-oh, my hiner, they would say, in old-timey terms.

20:24.340 --> 20:27.540
So is it possible that this is not the most efficient way?

20:27.540 --> 20:29.300
I mean, I can't envision a situation where it's like,

20:29.300 --> 20:32.980
oh no, my hiner is not the most efficient way.

20:32.980 --> 20:37.700
Um, extinguisher tank is empty, the hose got all tangled up,

20:37.700 --> 20:42.340
and there's a, there's still a small fire remaining.

20:43.220 --> 20:45.540
Oh, I know how to do water with my body.

20:45.540 --> 20:46.500
I'll cry on it.

20:46.500 --> 20:49.060
And then somebody's like, no, no, no, there's a better way.

20:50.420 --> 20:53.220
I think that there's a third question here.

20:54.100 --> 20:57.380
If, if, if, do you think that this is a,

20:57.380 --> 21:01.620
like, leave your badge and, like, fire axe on my desk,

21:01.620 --> 21:04.740
your loose cannon, um, you know,

21:04.740 --> 21:06.420
we can't have you on the force.

21:06.420 --> 21:08.340
Because of your, because of your loose cannon.

21:08.340 --> 21:11.140
Yeah, so, get out of here.

21:11.140 --> 21:12.660
But then, like, later in the day,

21:12.660 --> 21:15.460
they're in a fire and all of their extinguishers are empty,

21:15.460 --> 21:18.260
and they're like, if only they were here,

21:18.260 --> 21:20.580
and that person then just pees all over everything

21:20.580 --> 21:21.860
and saves the day.

21:21.860 --> 21:24.420
If only that pervert was still here.

21:24.420 --> 21:27.540
Here's the thing, maybe the firefighters want to piss

21:27.540 --> 21:30.900
on the fire, because they, they probably hate this hot stuff,

21:30.900 --> 21:32.180
hot stuff so much.

21:32.900 --> 21:35.780
They hate this hot air, which is all fire is.

21:35.780 --> 21:37.940
It's air that got too hot and burned it up.

21:38.660 --> 21:43.140
And they hate it so much that I think they probably do try

21:43.140 --> 21:45.540
as much as they can to put out the fire,

21:45.540 --> 21:46.820
except for one last bit.

21:47.860 --> 21:49.700
Especially the brave firefighters who go out

21:49.700 --> 21:51.540
into, like, the wildfire situations.

21:52.100 --> 21:54.340
And, and they, you know, they finally contain it,

21:54.340 --> 21:55.540
and it takes, like, two weeks,

21:55.540 --> 21:57.860
and it's a costly, like, horrible, horrible thing.

21:57.860 --> 21:59.620
I think at that point, if I was a firefighter

21:59.620 --> 22:01.940
and I found the last little bit of fire

22:01.940 --> 22:03.540
from this big wildfire, I'd be like,

22:03.540 --> 22:05.940
all right, motherfucker, time to put you down.

22:05.940 --> 22:08.580
And then, and I'm not making jokes,

22:08.580 --> 22:10.020
it's a horrible thing, but, like,

22:10.020 --> 22:12.420
I think I would be very, very angry at the fire.

22:12.420 --> 22:13.060
And I think I'd want to put it out.

22:13.060 --> 22:15.220
What if the fire was, what if it was so hot,

22:15.220 --> 22:18.340
they'll go from, like, it boiled the pee back up,

22:18.340 --> 22:18.900
so it's like the fire's fighting back.

22:18.900 --> 22:20.180
Come on, Travis.

22:20.180 --> 22:23.060
No, that, so you think it's more of a finishing move.

22:24.580 --> 22:26.660
Would it make it better if you took this small little bit

22:26.660 --> 22:29.620
of fire that was left, and you put it in the toilet,

22:29.620 --> 22:30.420
and then-

22:30.420 --> 22:31.700
And then you peed on it?

22:31.700 --> 22:32.500
Yeah.

22:32.500 --> 22:33.700
Yeah, I think that would be better.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.380
I think that there should be a rule

22:35.380 --> 22:38.340
in the Fire Person Code of Conduct that's just, like,

22:38.340 --> 22:42.580
you can do this if you need, if you also need to pee.

22:42.580 --> 22:44.020
Like, don't do it just cause.

22:44.820 --> 22:46.740
Don't do it just to showboat.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.340
How would you do it if you didn't need to pee?

22:48.980 --> 22:49.620
Well, it's-

22:49.620 --> 22:51.860
Just stand there and pound a bottle of water,

22:51.860 --> 22:53.140
like, hold on.

22:53.140 --> 22:55.300
Listen, we're getting into the honor system at this point,

22:55.300 --> 22:56.980
yes, but I think, like-

22:56.980 --> 22:59.300
This is taboo, but you just squeeze it real hard.

23:01.300 --> 23:02.020
This is taboo.

23:02.020 --> 23:03.300
This is podcast taboo.

23:03.300 --> 23:07.460
They won't talk about this on, you know, WTF

23:07.460 --> 23:10.420
or Comedy Bang Bang, but you just squeeze it real hard.

23:11.940 --> 23:14.820
Maybe it's like they make all the firefighters

23:14.820 --> 23:18.180
go to the bathroom before the alarm starts,

23:18.180 --> 23:20.820
and they're like, okay, everybody go to the bathroom now,

23:21.460 --> 23:23.380
cause once we get there, there's not gonna be a bathroom.

23:23.380 --> 23:26.260
Oh God, Travis, you just gave me a wave of anxiety.

23:26.260 --> 23:28.420
My whole life is based around like knowing

23:28.420 --> 23:29.780
that I'll be able to go to a place

23:29.780 --> 23:31.380
and not have to worry about the bathroom there

23:31.380 --> 23:32.340
and like timing it out.

23:32.900 --> 23:35.300
If I had a job that was like a bell rung

23:35.300 --> 23:37.780
and I had 45 seconds to put on essentially,

23:38.660 --> 23:40.660
you know, plate mail armor

23:40.660 --> 23:42.660
and then rush to the place I was going to,

23:42.660 --> 23:46.100
if I didn't have a chance to do my thing,

23:46.100 --> 23:48.020
oh my God, no.

23:48.020 --> 23:50.900
This is not the job for me for so many reasons.

23:50.900 --> 23:53.620
I bet that happened with, you mentioned plate mail.

23:53.620 --> 23:56.420
I bet there's a lot, like about half the time

23:56.420 --> 23:59.220
after your squire got you all dressed up as a knight,

23:59.220 --> 24:00.180
I bet you were like, oh.

24:00.180 --> 24:00.980
Oh man.

24:00.980 --> 24:02.500
Especially when you're jousting,

24:02.500 --> 24:04.820
you get hit while you're jousting, you're like, oh man.

24:04.820 --> 24:05.300
There it goes.

24:05.300 --> 24:06.900
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Tamerlane.

24:06.900 --> 24:07.460
Unstrap me.

24:08.260 --> 24:09.140
How about another question?

24:09.140 --> 24:10.500
Cause we've talked about piss.

24:10.500 --> 24:12.020
We can't do piss again for about 13 more.

24:12.020 --> 24:14.340
We talked about poop at the beginning too, so.

24:14.340 --> 24:16.580
Oh man, can we do the Tim Allen one again?

24:16.580 --> 24:23.140
Wait, did you just sample Iron John's rock?

24:24.260 --> 24:26.420
Yeah, no, I owe it a thousand dollars.

24:26.420 --> 24:27.860
Sorry, Iron John.

24:27.860 --> 24:29.460
I owe you a bunch of money now.

24:29.460 --> 24:31.460
The person who wrote the song isn't named John.

24:31.460 --> 24:33.220
I also want to make that very clear.

24:34.500 --> 24:35.700
Well then what's the point?

24:35.700 --> 24:37.460
I have no fucking clue.

24:37.460 --> 24:38.420
Why did they call it that?

24:38.420 --> 24:40.820
Why didn't they call it the Tim the Tool Man's tune?

24:40.820 --> 24:42.820
The Ballad of No.

24:42.820 --> 24:43.860
Toolin' Around.

24:43.860 --> 24:45.860
Toolin' Around would be a great name for a song.

24:45.860 --> 24:47.860
You think it would be a great name for a song.

24:48.740 --> 24:50.820
I work in a small office of about 10 people.

24:52.020 --> 24:53.460
My boss is always walking around,

24:54.260 --> 24:55.700
commenting on everyone's lunches.

24:56.340 --> 24:58.340
Like, wow, what's that?

24:58.340 --> 24:59.220
PB&J?

24:59.220 --> 25:00.260
Nice, classic.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.660
Let me get a closer look at that.

25:02.660 --> 25:02.980
Nice.

25:04.500 --> 25:06.740
He will swing by your desk if you get subway

25:06.740 --> 25:08.100
and ask you about every ingredient.

25:08.100 --> 25:10.100
Like, did you get onions on that thing?

25:10.100 --> 25:10.820
Wow, nice.

25:12.900 --> 25:14.820
I appreciate how positive he is about it though.

25:14.820 --> 25:15.460
Yeah.

25:15.460 --> 25:17.380
I know this sounds like a minor inconvenience,

25:17.380 --> 25:20.420
but it's so awkward and embarrassing and weird.

25:20.420 --> 25:22.500
And it's a harsh encroachment of my

25:22.500 --> 25:24.100
only 20 minutes I get to myself.

25:24.660 --> 25:26.660
Any advice is appreciated, Cool Brothers.

25:26.660 --> 25:28.580
That's from Just Trying to Eat in Manhattan.

25:30.020 --> 25:31.140
This is horrible.

25:31.140 --> 25:31.780
That's rough.

25:31.780 --> 25:34.580
This is so hard to answer because I also, on some level,

25:34.580 --> 25:37.860
really kind of sympathize with the boss.

25:38.660 --> 25:43.140
Because it's like, clearly this boss is not great at small talk.

25:43.140 --> 25:45.220
When your small talk includes,

25:45.220 --> 25:46.980
did you get onions on that?

25:46.980 --> 25:47.460
Nice.

25:48.180 --> 25:51.140
Like, you're not, you're bunting right there.

25:51.140 --> 25:52.180
That's small talk bunting.

25:52.180 --> 25:52.740
Right.

25:52.740 --> 25:53.780
And I get that.

25:53.780 --> 25:54.340
I do that all the time.

25:54.340 --> 25:55.780
He didn't have anything to add about onions.

25:55.780 --> 25:58.180
He didn't have any great observations about onions.

25:58.180 --> 25:58.980
Yeah.

25:58.980 --> 26:01.940
You're gonna need to start bringing in a little pup tent

26:01.940 --> 26:04.180
to work that you crack open.

26:05.140 --> 26:07.860
And then that's your little Christopher Robin hidey hole.

26:07.860 --> 26:09.060
And nobody's allowed to go in there

26:09.060 --> 26:10.100
when you're eating your lunch.

26:10.660 --> 26:12.180
Don't come in with a lunch tent.

26:12.180 --> 26:14.820
You're not allowed in the lunch tent.

26:14.820 --> 26:15.940
This is where I do lunch.

26:15.940 --> 26:17.220
If that's too big a burden,

26:17.220 --> 26:19.700
maybe just cover yourself up with a big blanket while you eat.

26:20.660 --> 26:22.580
Or go hide in the bathroom

26:22.580 --> 26:25.780
and have a sandwich on the toilet or something.

26:25.780 --> 26:30.660
Because this fills me with so much dread.

26:31.380 --> 26:33.540
Like, this is such a precious time in my life.

26:33.540 --> 26:36.980
And the last thing I need is spectators for the Onion Show.

26:37.540 --> 26:38.420
It's so bad.

26:38.420 --> 26:42.820
Yeah, it's also a lot of pressure to then have to explain

26:42.820 --> 26:44.900
the ingredients you got on your Subway sandwich.

26:44.900 --> 26:47.060
A thing that you hope never gets asked.

26:47.060 --> 26:47.860
Please don't ask me.

26:47.860 --> 26:49.700
Because I don't have a good answer

26:49.700 --> 26:52.020
for why I said yes, tomatoes.

26:52.020 --> 26:52.900
I just wanted them.

26:53.620 --> 26:56.180
Yeah, sometimes I'll get green peppers and sometimes I won't.

26:56.180 --> 26:56.500
Yeah.

26:56.500 --> 26:59.060
And I don't want to have to delve deep into why.

26:59.060 --> 27:00.180
It's just like,

27:00.180 --> 27:02.900
I think you're not gonna get out of the situation unless you hide.

27:02.900 --> 27:04.340
And if you don't want to hide during your lunchtime,

27:04.340 --> 27:05.380
because it's our God-given right,

27:05.380 --> 27:08.500
according to the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence,

27:08.500 --> 27:11.220
then I think you got to limit the number of ingredients

27:11.220 --> 27:12.260
in the lunch that you eat.

27:12.260 --> 27:17.140
And maybe you just eat one very big apple for lunch every day.

27:17.140 --> 27:18.820
And then they will come by still and be like,

27:18.820 --> 27:20.260
oh, big, big apple, huh?

27:21.380 --> 27:23.620
That's New York, bye, nice, bye.

27:23.620 --> 27:24.820
And then it's like four seconds.

27:24.820 --> 27:26.260
And then they're back out of your life.

27:26.980 --> 27:30.420
Can I offer a slightly more aggressive option?

27:31.140 --> 27:31.860
Sure.

27:31.860 --> 27:35.540
A big clock on your desk, timer that you set to however long

27:35.540 --> 27:36.740
your lunchtime is,

27:36.740 --> 27:38.820
and when your boss comes over to start talking to you,

27:38.820 --> 27:41.220
you stop it, turn and talk to them,

27:41.940 --> 27:43.380
engage with them in their talk,

27:43.380 --> 27:45.460
and then turn back and start it again.

27:45.460 --> 27:48.900
Me talking to you about my precious onions is work.

27:48.900 --> 27:49.940
That's work time.

27:49.940 --> 27:50.820
That's work time.

27:51.460 --> 27:52.020
Are you done?

27:53.140 --> 27:54.660
Because I'm on onion time now.

27:54.660 --> 27:56.340
I'm on, I will get back to onion time,

27:56.340 --> 27:57.860
but this is work time if we're talking.

27:57.860 --> 28:00.900
You're my boss, you're not my friend, Charles.

28:00.900 --> 28:02.580
And make the clock say that.

28:03.380 --> 28:05.540
You're my boss, not my friend, Charles.

28:06.420 --> 28:08.420
I will talk to you about my onions,

28:08.420 --> 28:10.580
but it's time theft, and you're the thief.

28:11.460 --> 28:12.900
Goodbye, Charles, and click.

28:17.780 --> 28:20.180
I think that if your boss is talking to you,

28:20.180 --> 28:22.500
you legally should not,

28:22.500 --> 28:25.220
it cannot be counted as your lunch break.

28:25.220 --> 28:28.180
Because like, what else are you breaking from

28:28.180 --> 28:29.620
other than the people you work with?

28:29.620 --> 28:32.660
Right, even if your boss was, in real life,

28:32.660 --> 28:35.220
your best friend, not now.

28:36.260 --> 28:38.020
Not now, it's onion time.

28:38.020 --> 28:41.940
I think he says, you get onions on that?

28:41.940 --> 28:42.420
Nice.

28:42.420 --> 28:43.780
And you say, no, I didn't.

28:43.780 --> 28:45.460
Even though there's onions clearly hanging out

28:45.460 --> 28:47.940
the side of it, because you got so many onions.

28:47.940 --> 28:50.180
You got so many fucking onions on your sandwich,

28:50.180 --> 28:52.020
it can't even contain all the onions.

28:52.020 --> 28:54.020
Maybe you just get two pieces of bread

28:54.020 --> 28:55.860
and like 80 onions in it, and they're like,

28:55.860 --> 28:56.660
oh, onions, huh?

28:56.660 --> 28:57.620
Like whole onions.

28:57.620 --> 28:58.260
Whole onions.

28:58.260 --> 29:00.020
They say, oh, a bunch of whole onions, huh?

29:00.020 --> 29:00.660
Just like Shrek.

29:00.660 --> 29:02.260
And you say, no, I didn't.

29:02.260 --> 29:03.700
Get the fuck out of here, Charles.

29:04.980 --> 29:08.180
Now, we obviously do not support people asking

29:08.180 --> 29:09.380
about your sandwich while you're trying

29:09.380 --> 29:10.340
to have your lunch break.

29:10.340 --> 29:11.700
That's been made clear.

29:11.700 --> 29:14.180
But is there an amount of onions

29:14.180 --> 29:16.100
where you have to just accept

29:16.100 --> 29:16.900
that people are gonna-

29:17.860 --> 29:20.340
It's out of concern instead of interest.

29:20.340 --> 29:21.700
Oh man, too many onions.

29:21.700 --> 29:22.260
Not nice.

29:24.260 --> 29:26.180
It's like you've given up your right

29:26.180 --> 29:29.300
to not be grilled about your, thank you,

29:29.300 --> 29:32.980
about your onions, because there's just so many

29:32.980 --> 29:34.740
that you're inviting it at that point.

29:34.740 --> 29:36.260
It would almost be like a little,

29:36.260 --> 29:39.140
like you're obviously wanting someone to ask.

29:39.140 --> 29:40.420
It's a cry for help.

29:40.420 --> 29:42.020
You're wanting someone to ask you about

29:42.020 --> 29:44.260
how many onions you want to slice to onions.

29:44.260 --> 29:44.500
Right.

29:44.500 --> 29:45.300
Thank you.

29:45.300 --> 29:48.020
I think it's you and your cubicle mate,

29:48.900 --> 29:51.620
Parson, Parson Brown, and the two of you

29:51.620 --> 29:53.460
are eating your big onion sandwiches

29:53.460 --> 29:55.060
and laughing and talking about how great

29:55.060 --> 29:56.340
the onions are today.

29:56.340 --> 29:58.900
So sweet, so crisp, so bitter, so many.

29:58.900 --> 30:01.620
And then your boss comes by and is like,

30:01.620 --> 30:02.740
hey, you guys having an onion?

30:02.740 --> 30:05.380
And you both turn to Charles at the same time.

30:05.380 --> 30:06.660
You're like, Charles, not now.

30:07.540 --> 30:08.740
We're talking about our onions.

30:09.380 --> 30:11.060
I'll talk to you later when I'm done talking

30:11.060 --> 30:12.820
to my friend, Parson, about the onions.

30:12.820 --> 30:14.660
But now you're interrupting and being rude.

30:15.220 --> 30:16.740
And then you do that every day

30:17.300 --> 30:19.380
and you're gonna get very sick

30:19.380 --> 30:21.060
from all the onions.

30:21.060 --> 30:23.060
Yeah, but it'll be worth it.

30:23.060 --> 30:23.860
It's a good episode.

30:23.860 --> 30:25.460
This is the spec script of the office

30:25.460 --> 30:26.260
we're writing right now.

30:27.700 --> 30:29.060
Oh, Jim's at it again.

30:29.620 --> 30:30.500
Jim's at it again.

30:30.500 --> 30:31.380
Dwight's like, what's with the onions?

30:31.380 --> 30:32.900
He's like, I don't know what you're talking about, Dwight.

30:32.900 --> 30:34.260
And Dwight just starts crying.

30:34.260 --> 30:35.460
He says, these aren't onions.

30:35.460 --> 30:36.980
And then he gets onion poisoning.

30:36.980 --> 30:37.620
And dies.

30:38.820 --> 30:40.180
But then he comes back as a ghost

30:40.180 --> 30:41.540
and haunts Dwight.

30:41.540 --> 30:42.980
Happy Halloween.

30:42.980 --> 30:45.140
And he didn't die because the staff

30:45.140 --> 30:46.900
at Chicago Med was there.

30:46.900 --> 30:48.580
That's right, crossover episode.

30:49.540 --> 30:52.020
And he just keeps looking into his snow globe.

30:52.020 --> 30:54.420
Yeah, and that one's in it too.

30:54.420 --> 30:56.020
Crisis on an onion.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.100
Then old Dick Van Dyke shows up at the office

30:58.100 --> 31:01.060
and he's like, my diagnosis is murder.

31:01.860 --> 31:02.660
You know, it's funny.

31:03.460 --> 31:05.780
If he did show up once, it's like,

31:05.780 --> 31:07.540
my diagnosis is murder.

31:08.260 --> 31:11.060
They would say, well, thank you for that.

31:11.060 --> 31:12.340
That's very vindicating.

31:13.300 --> 31:15.220
Could you maybe solve a crime now?

31:19.220 --> 31:19.540
And then you die.

31:19.540 --> 31:20.340
Murder.

31:20.340 --> 31:23.060
Yeah, there's a knife and the whole bit.

31:23.060 --> 31:24.980
We definitely know the diagnosis

31:24.980 --> 31:26.900
of this case is murder.

31:26.900 --> 31:28.580
Could you do something to advance

31:28.580 --> 31:31.220
the resolution of the murder?

31:31.220 --> 31:33.700
And then Viola Davis walks on screen

31:33.700 --> 31:35.700
where there's already about 14 characters

31:35.700 --> 31:37.220
at this point and just says,

31:37.220 --> 31:39.860
how to get away with onions.

31:42.100 --> 31:43.540
And then she leaves with all the onions

31:43.540 --> 31:44.740
because nobody noticed.

31:44.740 --> 31:45.380
And who's that?

31:45.380 --> 31:46.980
It's J.D. and Turk.

31:46.980 --> 31:48.580
And they are up to their old tricks

31:48.580 --> 31:53.140
and scrubbing onions.

31:53.140 --> 31:55.300
I'm having a lot of fun with you boys today.

32:00.180 --> 32:02.580
OK, I guess it's time to go to the money zone.

32:03.540 --> 32:04.020
Let's go.

32:15.220 --> 32:16.820
I want to tell you all about Blue Apron.

32:16.820 --> 32:19.140
Boy, if you like onions, there's one

32:19.140 --> 32:20.340
and basically all of them.

32:20.340 --> 32:22.420
And that's good because onions are good

32:22.420 --> 32:24.340
and these recipes are good.

32:24.340 --> 32:26.980
All all the stuff comes to you

32:26.980 --> 32:29.700
in pre-portioned ingredients that are fresh

32:29.700 --> 32:31.140
and step by step recipes

32:31.140 --> 32:32.100
that come right to your door.

32:32.100 --> 32:33.460
They tell you what to do with the onions,

32:33.460 --> 32:36.100
how to touch them, and they can all be cooked

32:36.100 --> 32:37.140
in under 45 minutes.

32:37.140 --> 32:39.460
The menu features 12 new recipes each week

32:39.460 --> 32:40.900
based on what's in season.

32:40.900 --> 32:42.180
Onions are always in season

32:42.180 --> 32:44.340
and is designed by Blue Apron's

32:44.340 --> 32:45.540
in-house culinary team

32:45.540 --> 32:47.380
with incredible ingredients

32:47.380 --> 32:48.420
and chef-designed recipes

32:48.420 --> 32:49.780
like strip steaks with potatoes

32:49.780 --> 32:51.220
and spicy maple collard greens.

32:51.220 --> 32:52.260
Blue Apron lets you see

32:52.260 --> 32:53.780
what the power of food can do.

32:54.740 --> 32:55.780
Harness it.

32:55.780 --> 32:57.060
Harness this power.

32:57.060 --> 32:58.260
Blue Apron is treating my brother,

32:58.260 --> 32:59.140
my brother and me listeners

32:59.140 --> 33:00.660

33:10.660 --> 33:12.340
Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

33:13.060 --> 33:14.260
I would like to tell you

33:14.260 --> 33:15.940
about Bowl and Branch.

33:17.460 --> 33:20.420
I love sheets and I'm not afraid.

33:20.420 --> 33:21.060
Who knows it?

33:22.900 --> 33:24.820
Did you know that every day

33:24.820 --> 33:27.060
you spend 14 hours in sheets?

33:29.300 --> 33:30.580
That sounds about right for me, actually.

33:30.580 --> 33:31.620
That's not true for Justin, yeah.

33:33.220 --> 33:34.340
So anyway, sheets are great.

33:34.340 --> 33:35.540
Well, if you're out of the time

33:35.540 --> 33:37.700
I spend at Sheets the gas station

33:37.700 --> 33:39.300
and Sheets the sheets,

33:39.300 --> 33:40.020
it's probably pretty close.

33:40.020 --> 33:42.100
Justin spends about two hours sleeping

33:42.100 --> 33:43.540
and then 12 hours crying

33:43.540 --> 33:44.660
in a Sheets bathroom.

33:46.660 --> 33:47.780
Bow and Branch sheets are crafted

33:47.780 --> 33:49.540
with 100% organic cotton.

33:49.540 --> 33:51.140
They look great and they feel amazing.

33:51.140 --> 33:53.300

33:57.140 --> 33:58.340
you know, the retail markups

33:59.220 --> 34:00.420
because you pay a lot of like

34:00.420 --> 34:03.540
brick and mortar store like operation costs

34:03.540 --> 34:04.580
when you buy the store.

35:19.220 --> 35:20.580
they have it all figured out.

35:20.580 --> 35:23.460
And I wanna be there with them.

35:24.020 --> 35:26.020
I would just, any answers they have

35:26.020 --> 35:28.020
if they have some answers for me.

35:28.020 --> 35:30.100
I'm feeling a little lost right now.

35:30.100 --> 35:31.300
I have a personal message here.

35:31.300 --> 35:31.620
This one's-

35:31.620 --> 35:34.420
How do it hate Hi, Hungry, I'm Dad?

35:34.420 --> 35:35.300
How do it sleep?

35:35.860 --> 35:37.700
Don't know, don't know.

35:37.700 --> 35:38.900
I got a message here for Jack

35:38.900 --> 35:40.260
and it's from Dad.

35:40.980 --> 35:42.500
Daddy says to Jack,

35:42.500 --> 35:44.340
Jack, this is your father reminding you

35:44.340 --> 35:45.780
not to sweat the small things.

35:45.780 --> 35:46.820
You're perfect as you are

35:46.820 --> 35:48.820
and have made your mother and I very proud.

35:48.820 --> 35:50.260
I love you more than a bushel,

35:50.260 --> 35:52.020
a peck, a barrel and a heap.

35:52.020 --> 35:54.980
I love you enough to kiss you square on the lips.

35:54.980 --> 35:57.460
This is the best dad then, huh?

35:57.460 --> 35:58.260
This is so sweet.

35:58.260 --> 36:00.020
Yeah, way better than Justin.

36:00.020 --> 36:01.220
Best dad sounds like best dad

36:01.220 --> 36:02.260
and maybe best Jack

36:02.260 --> 36:04.820
and Jack don't sweat the small stuff.

36:04.820 --> 36:07.620
Yeah, don't get small sweaty things, you know?

36:07.620 --> 36:09.220
Listen to your dad.

36:09.220 --> 36:11.460
Don't let your small things get sweaty

36:11.460 --> 36:13.460
and don't even sweat the big stuff.

36:13.460 --> 36:15.860
Now, the medium stuff,

36:15.860 --> 36:17.540
you gotta keep a fucking eye.

36:17.540 --> 36:19.940
Keep your head on a swivel for the medium stuff, Jack,

36:19.940 --> 36:21.620
because that's where they get you.

36:21.620 --> 36:23.540
That's where they get you.

36:23.540 --> 36:24.740
Mostly the middle.

36:24.740 --> 36:25.620
One more.

36:25.620 --> 36:30.660
This is for Kelly and it's from Kelly.

36:31.460 --> 36:33.860
Whoa, from Kelly to Justin.

36:33.860 --> 36:36.020
Kelly, happy birthday, Kelly.

36:36.020 --> 36:36.900
Although, Kelly,

36:36.900 --> 36:39.460
you know how the brothers McElroy are, Kelly,

36:39.460 --> 36:42.900
and this message is probably being read in June, Kelly.

36:42.900 --> 36:45.380
In that case, happy mom-iversary, Kelly,

36:45.380 --> 36:47.220
and happy third birthday, McDermott.

36:47.780 --> 36:50.020
And if it's any other time of the year, Kelly,

36:50.020 --> 36:51.140
well, great job.

36:52.180 --> 36:56.500
Now, to be fair, we didn't get that in June,

36:56.500 --> 36:59.380
but it does say as close to January 4th as possible.

37:00.020 --> 37:00.580
All right.

37:00.580 --> 37:02.180
Yeah, we did about as bad a job.

37:02.180 --> 37:04.900
Happy Olympic closing ceremonies, Kelly.

37:05.700 --> 37:06.820
You've done it.

37:06.820 --> 37:08.340
You did great up there.

37:08.340 --> 37:09.780
Could have done better.

37:09.780 --> 37:10.740
Could have been worse.

37:10.740 --> 37:12.020
Could have been worse.

37:12.020 --> 37:13.140
You did great up there.

37:14.420 --> 37:15.940
You extinguished the Olympic torch.

37:15.940 --> 37:17.380
We are all so proud.

37:17.380 --> 37:19.460
You extinguished the Olympic torch with your mind.

37:19.460 --> 37:21.380
Which was cool, but no one asked you to do that.

37:24.500 --> 37:26.660
Judge John Hodgman ruled in my favor.

37:26.660 --> 37:29.140
Judge John Hodgman ruled in my friend's favor.

37:29.140 --> 37:32.100
Judge John Hodgman ruled in my favor.

37:32.100 --> 37:33.540
I'm Judge John Hodgman.

37:33.540 --> 37:36.340
You're hearing the voices of real litigants, real people,

37:36.340 --> 37:38.980
who have submitted disputes to my internet court

37:38.980 --> 37:40.660
at the Judge John Hodgman podcast.

37:40.660 --> 37:41.860
I hear their cases.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.060
I ask them questions.

37:43.060 --> 37:44.020
They're good ones.

37:44.020 --> 37:46.020
And then I tell them who's right and who's wrong.

37:46.500 --> 37:48.580
Thanks to Judge John Hodgman's ruling,

37:48.580 --> 37:50.260
my dad has been forced to retire,

37:50.260 --> 37:52.740
one of the worst dad jokes of all time.

37:52.740 --> 37:55.780
Instead of cutting his own hair with a flowbee,

37:55.780 --> 37:58.660
my husband has his hair cut professionally.

37:58.660 --> 38:00.580
I have to join a community theater group.

38:00.580 --> 38:03.220
And my wife has stopped bringing home wild animals

38:03.220 --> 38:06.580
It's the Judge John Hodgman podcast.

38:06.580 --> 38:09.380
Find it every Wednesday at MaximumFun.org

38:09.380 --> 38:11.140
or wherever you download podcasts.

38:13.460 --> 38:14.900
Thanks, Judge John Hodgman.

38:18.180 --> 38:20.660
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Nathan Smith.

38:20.660 --> 38:21.300
Thank you, Nathan.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.740
It's Yahoo Answers user.

38:22.740 --> 38:25.700
Sorry, something's gone wrong, but it was sent in by Jason.

38:25.700 --> 38:28.020
Jason Jith, who asks,

38:30.020 --> 38:31.380
how do I play a video game?

38:31.380 --> 38:33.300
I never played a video game in my life before.

38:33.300 --> 38:34.740
What video game should I get?

38:34.740 --> 38:36.980
There was like thousands of video games at the stores

38:36.980 --> 38:38.500
with lots of colorful pictures.

38:39.060 --> 38:40.340
Also, I think the store person said,

38:40.340 --> 38:41.380
I need to have a console.

38:41.380 --> 38:41.860
What is that?

38:41.860 --> 38:44.020
PS3, PS4, Xbox, Nintendo?

38:44.020 --> 38:44.980
What is that?

38:45.940 --> 38:47.140
No, that's the upsell.

38:47.140 --> 38:48.340
You don't need a console.

38:48.340 --> 38:49.060
You do not need it.

38:49.060 --> 38:49.540
Yeah.

38:49.540 --> 38:50.420
You do not need it.

38:50.420 --> 38:51.540
That's how they get you.

38:51.540 --> 38:52.980
Do you own a Discman?

38:52.980 --> 38:53.480
Yeah.

38:54.340 --> 38:56.740
I got good news, vis-a-vis Kirby.

38:56.740 --> 38:57.300
He's here.

38:57.300 --> 38:57.940
You're gonna need,

38:57.940 --> 38:59.860
you are gonna need the adapter though.

38:59.860 --> 39:03.940
Yes, the Kirby adapter.

39:03.940 --> 39:06.580
It goes on your mouth and it lets you suck stuff in

39:07.540 --> 39:11.620
to turn into a fire or a laser.

39:12.740 --> 39:14.260
There's so many games though.

39:14.260 --> 39:15.620
And where do you even start?

39:15.620 --> 39:18.260
Never played a game and you want to start being gaming.

39:20.580 --> 39:21.460
I mean, what kind of,

39:21.460 --> 39:22.740
let's start from the basics.

39:23.620 --> 39:25.140
Getting your head in the right place.

39:25.140 --> 39:27.620
So for me, I think it's important to take a beat

39:27.620 --> 39:31.220
and plug in your game into whatever disc player you got.

39:31.780 --> 39:33.140
And then you need to take a second

39:33.860 --> 39:35.540
and just remember, none of it's real.

39:36.420 --> 39:36.980
It's not.

39:36.980 --> 39:38.020
That is so important.

39:38.020 --> 39:40.660
Because you do, you play Kirby and you think like,

39:40.660 --> 39:42.900
am I gonna get stomped by the monsters?

39:42.900 --> 39:45.940
Is the big tree gonna throw apples at me until I die?

39:45.940 --> 39:47.780
That almost never happens.

39:47.780 --> 39:48.580
It almost never happens.

39:48.580 --> 39:50.980
And you're fighting the big tree and it's yelling at you

39:50.980 --> 39:52.580
and throwing the big apples at you.

39:52.580 --> 39:55.940
And you could, if you're not a gamer,

39:55.940 --> 39:59.860
you might think I'm going to die when the pink man dies

39:59.860 --> 40:01.940
because of all the apples that got thrown right at me

40:01.940 --> 40:02.900
that hit me.

40:02.900 --> 40:05.300
And now I'm too scared to continue gaming.

40:05.300 --> 40:07.300
And it's really important for me to tell you

40:07.300 --> 40:09.060
that most of the games, if you die in them,

40:09.060 --> 40:10.100
you won't die in real life.

40:10.100 --> 40:10.900
Most of them.

40:10.900 --> 40:14.340
And I will say this is something that they won't tell you.

40:14.340 --> 40:16.740
But you could, if you used to read Nintendo Power,

40:16.740 --> 40:19.060
this is like on the last page of every Nintendo Power,

40:19.060 --> 40:21.140
a list of games that you actually,

40:21.140 --> 40:23.460
the only way to win is to turn off the game

40:23.460 --> 40:24.660
and never play it again.

40:24.660 --> 40:26.340
Like you'd be in one of those fights where like,

40:26.340 --> 40:28.820
there's no way I can beat this boss.

40:28.820 --> 40:32.340
Well, the trick is you turn it off and that kills the boss.

40:33.700 --> 40:36.020
Yeah, it only exists while you're playing.

40:36.020 --> 40:38.900
Sometimes you gotta move your controller

40:40.340 --> 40:41.540
over to the second port.

40:42.180 --> 40:44.500
That's something that will work in some games.

40:44.500 --> 40:45.860
Yeah, I do that with every game now,

40:45.860 --> 40:48.260
just to make sure that I'm not being tricked in some way.

40:48.260 --> 40:49.860
Another thing to keep in mind

40:49.860 --> 40:51.780
is if you have a bad time with the game

40:51.780 --> 40:53.540
and say you're playing Kirby's Dream Land,

40:53.540 --> 40:55.220
even though it's called Kirby's Dream Land,

40:55.220 --> 40:56.180
Kirby didn't make it.

40:56.980 --> 40:58.260
Kirby didn't make the game.

40:58.260 --> 40:59.540
He's the star of the game.

40:59.540 --> 41:00.820
And so they called it Kirby's Dream Land.

41:00.820 --> 41:02.580
And I know that's confusing because like,

41:03.460 --> 41:05.540
when you go to the movies and you go see like,

41:05.540 --> 41:07.700
I wanna see George Lucas' Star Wars,

41:07.700 --> 41:10.260
you know right there what it says on the tin who made it.

41:11.620 --> 41:13.380
That's not how it works in games sometimes.

41:13.380 --> 41:16.580
Sometimes it'll be called like Super Mario's Odyssey.

41:17.140 --> 41:19.300
But it's not, he didn't, Jesus Christ,

41:19.300 --> 41:20.660
how are you not getting this?

41:21.140 --> 41:22.100
He didn't make it.

41:22.100 --> 41:23.380
He didn't make it.

41:23.380 --> 41:24.260
Someone made it.

41:24.260 --> 41:25.860
Like one or two people made it.

41:25.860 --> 41:27.300
When you get angry at the game

41:27.300 --> 41:29.060
because you died from too many apples,

41:29.620 --> 41:31.620
stop writing angry letters to Kirby.

41:31.620 --> 41:33.460
He didn't, it's not him.

41:33.460 --> 41:34.420
He didn't do it.

41:34.420 --> 41:35.300
He didn't make it.

41:35.300 --> 41:36.580
Jack Kirby made it.

41:36.580 --> 41:37.940
Jack Kirby made it by himself.

41:38.500 --> 41:44.580
Another joke about video games is trade-ins.

41:44.580 --> 41:48.660
If you, the problem with getting into video games

41:48.660 --> 41:53.140
is if you don't already have video games to trade in

41:53.140 --> 41:54.420
towards a brand new video game,

41:54.980 --> 41:58.020
you really, there's no way to get into the systems.

41:58.020 --> 41:59.300
You can't get into the system.

41:59.300 --> 42:00.740
So you're kind of locked out.

42:00.740 --> 42:05.140
You could inherit games and that's pretty much it.

42:05.140 --> 42:08.900
Can I ask you boys, I'm not a professional gamer.

42:08.900 --> 42:11.300
I have a question for you two boys.

42:11.300 --> 42:12.900
I think you're professional gamers.

42:12.900 --> 42:14.900
I haven't checked in in a while.

42:15.700 --> 42:18.340
Is there, did they ever make a matching power glove

42:18.340 --> 42:19.300
so you could have two?

42:20.660 --> 42:22.820
And so you can really fondle the pong.

42:23.540 --> 42:27.220
Yeah, cause if I just have the power glove on one hand,

42:27.220 --> 42:28.820
doesn't my other hand get cold?

42:29.780 --> 42:31.540
Yeah, but that's the game of your life.

42:32.500 --> 42:33.780
Just cold hand?

42:33.780 --> 42:36.020
Something also is you're gonna start getting frustrated

42:36.020 --> 42:39.700
that you can't figure out how to kiss in every video game.

42:40.340 --> 42:41.780
Cause a lot of games are pretty open

42:41.780 --> 42:45.540
with what the kissing button is, the Sims, other ones.

42:45.540 --> 42:46.820
But a lot of the time you'll be like,

42:46.820 --> 42:49.220
I don't think there's a way to, just keep trying.

42:49.860 --> 42:51.700
You're gonna, you're gonna figure it out.

42:52.980 --> 42:55.700
Mario is missing is you have to press X and Y

42:55.700 --> 42:57.620
at the same time and then Luigi.

42:57.620 --> 42:58.820
Wait, shit, really?

42:58.820 --> 42:59.860
Is Mario missing?

42:59.860 --> 43:01.700
Griffin, you can't drop that on me.

43:01.700 --> 43:01.940
Yeah.

43:01.940 --> 43:03.060
What if I need to talk to him?

43:03.060 --> 43:04.340
Well, that was the last Mario game.

43:04.340 --> 43:07.220
Cause he was not, well, he was found, his body was.

43:07.220 --> 43:08.500
But while you're playing that one,

43:08.500 --> 43:10.020
you're gonna want to kiss and you're not gonna figure out

43:10.020 --> 43:11.380
how to just hit X and Y together.

43:11.380 --> 43:13.460
If you get online, online is a great resource

43:13.460 --> 43:14.980
for knowledge for so many things.

43:14.980 --> 43:18.820
And a lot of times people, online, you know,

43:18.820 --> 43:20.820
web content users will tell you

43:20.820 --> 43:23.540
what buttons to press to do, to kiss.

43:24.740 --> 43:27.540
Another thing that if you're just getting into gaming now

43:27.540 --> 43:30.020
that I think, no one talks about,

43:30.020 --> 43:31.460
but I'll tell you right now,

43:31.460 --> 43:34.420
you'll find yourself playing Sonic T Hedgehog

43:34.420 --> 43:39.780
and you'll be like, I'm feeling an erotic interest in this,

43:39.780 --> 43:43.700
but the game images aren't giving me what I need.

43:43.700 --> 43:48.100
Is there somewhere where I might find these images?

43:48.100 --> 43:49.380
And the answer is no.

43:50.980 --> 43:54.180
No, unfortunately that just, no one's gotten into that yet.

43:54.180 --> 43:56.260
You're the only one that feels that way.

43:57.460 --> 43:58.980
And I'm sorry I have to break that to you.

43:59.700 --> 44:00.900
Yeah, it's rough.

44:00.900 --> 44:04.180
A lot of people go looking for horny Sonic T Hedgehog images

44:04.180 --> 44:05.860
after they're done playing Sonic Hedgehog,

44:05.860 --> 44:08.340
but there's not, I'm so sorry.

44:08.980 --> 44:10.100
There isn't any.

44:10.100 --> 44:11.780
There isn't any and we haven't figured out

44:11.780 --> 44:12.660
how to make them yet.

44:12.660 --> 44:14.100
So stop asking.

44:14.100 --> 44:14.900
So stop asking.

44:14.900 --> 44:16.740
Elon Musk was working on it for a while

44:16.740 --> 44:18.260
and then he got distracted by space.

44:19.620 --> 44:21.380
But hopefully he'll get back into it

44:21.380 --> 44:24.340
because he was, Elon Musk is really into

44:24.340 --> 44:26.660
erotic Sonic T Hedgehog imagery.

44:26.660 --> 44:28.420
Oh, and Travis, can you give me that one clean

44:28.420 --> 44:30.340
so that when we're taking to court

44:30.340 --> 44:32.820
they have like exactly the sound bite that they need.

44:32.820 --> 44:34.260
All right, Justin, just be quiet for a sec.

44:34.260 --> 44:36.340
Here, I'm gonna put in a click right here

44:36.340 --> 44:37.140
just so we have it clean.

44:37.140 --> 44:39.780
Go ahead and say that thing you just said again, Travis, legally.

44:39.780 --> 44:45.140
Elon Musk is very into erotic Sonic T Hedgehog imagery.

44:45.140 --> 44:47.220
Okay, I said okay a little tight there,

44:47.220 --> 44:48.260
but I think we can cut it out.

44:48.260 --> 44:49.620
Yeah, we can clean that up.

44:49.620 --> 44:50.340
We'll cut it down.

44:51.940 --> 44:53.700
I wanna read another question.

44:53.700 --> 44:54.980
Well, I just also wanted to say,

44:54.980 --> 44:56.580
get the Xbox that plays all the games.

44:56.580 --> 44:56.980
Go ahead.

44:58.180 --> 45:00.820
I teach seventh grade English language arts

45:00.820 --> 45:01.940
at a local middle school.

45:01.940 --> 45:03.540
There has been a dead roach on the inside

45:03.540 --> 45:05.060
of one of the lights for an entire year.

45:05.060 --> 45:05.460
Nasty.

45:05.460 --> 45:07.300
I haven't moved it because one,

45:07.300 --> 45:09.460
I wouldn't know how to put the light cover back on

45:09.460 --> 45:11.780
and two, I never thought anyone would notice.

45:11.780 --> 45:13.860
Nobody knows how to put the light cover back on.

45:13.860 --> 45:15.780
You have to take it off and that's how you learn.

45:16.340 --> 45:17.300
None of us know.

45:17.300 --> 45:19.220
Okay, I do like that this question,

45:19.220 --> 45:22.100
that also struck me that the question I was concerned wasn't,

45:22.100 --> 45:23.540
I don't know how to take the cover off.

45:24.820 --> 45:25.700
Obvious, got it.

45:26.260 --> 45:27.860
But then what do I do?

45:29.300 --> 45:31.060
That is a much worse scenario.

45:31.060 --> 45:33.700
In their defense, it is much worse to call facilities

45:33.700 --> 45:38.580
and be like, we've got a light fixture on the ground over here.

45:38.580 --> 45:39.940
Vandals.

45:39.940 --> 45:41.620
Vandals have unscrewed.

45:43.460 --> 45:46.260
Anyway, that all changed when my fifth period class

45:46.260 --> 45:47.940
decided to personify the roach

45:47.940 --> 45:50.180
as our deceased class pet named Tommy.

45:50.900 --> 45:53.300
I played along with it because it seemed like silly harmless fun.

45:53.300 --> 45:55.860
However, my students now have a funeral plan

45:55.860 --> 45:57.780
for Tommy the roach on Friday of this week.

45:57.780 --> 46:00.340
One student wrote a eulogy and several of them requested

46:00.340 --> 46:02.020
that I wear black out of respect.

46:02.020 --> 46:04.020
I'm concerned about wasting class time,

46:04.020 --> 46:06.100
but I don't want to stifle my students creativity.

46:06.100 --> 46:08.740
Please help.

46:08.740 --> 46:10.980
This is Creative Cockroach Conundrum in Texas.

46:10.980 --> 46:15.220
Here, if you wanted to like live in the bit,

46:15.220 --> 46:19.300
but also try to get things back on track

46:19.300 --> 46:21.700
so you learn about, I don't know,

46:21.700 --> 46:23.140
which countries are named what.

46:24.180 --> 46:25.460
Oh, it's language arts.

46:25.460 --> 46:27.940
Okay, well that's, yeah, they have English language names.

46:27.940 --> 46:28.440
Sure.

46:29.540 --> 46:30.500
You could say that like,

46:30.500 --> 46:32.500
since they didn't know the roach when it was alive,

46:32.500 --> 46:35.620
they don't really know what sort of like faith background

46:35.620 --> 46:37.700
the roach had and they don't know,

46:37.700 --> 46:39.300
you don't know like what kind of service

46:39.300 --> 46:40.740
the roach would have wanted.

46:40.740 --> 46:43.700
Like that could be how he wanted to sort of like

46:45.060 --> 46:50.420
spend his after days is there in the light fixture

46:50.420 --> 46:54.020
without a bunch of Judeo-Christian nonsense,

46:54.020 --> 46:56.740
sort of like helping shepherd him across the river Styx.

46:56.740 --> 46:58.900
Now you could, if you did want to make it educational,

46:58.900 --> 47:00.100
you're going to need a conveyor belt.

47:00.820 --> 47:02.420
You're going to need a small toilet

47:02.420 --> 47:03.940
and you're going to have the conveyor belt

47:03.940 --> 47:05.140
going into the toilet

47:05.140 --> 47:07.380
and you're going to put Tommy on one end of it,

47:07.380 --> 47:10.820
Tommy's desiccated corpse and desiccated.

47:10.820 --> 47:11.780
It's been both things.

47:11.780 --> 47:15.060
And you put it on there and you let the conveyor belt go

47:15.060 --> 47:18.420
and you say like, oh, the conveyor belt's going,

47:19.060 --> 47:20.900
better tell me what a preposition is.

47:20.900 --> 47:22.100
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

47:22.100 --> 47:24.340
And get them to answer some high pressure.

47:24.340 --> 47:28.500
Because one thing the roach doesn't want for its last rites

47:28.500 --> 47:31.700
is to go in a toilet like some sort of common fish.

47:31.700 --> 47:34.180
Here's the thing, when you're worried about it being educational,

47:34.180 --> 47:36.500
I think what you really need to do is look around the room,

47:36.500 --> 47:40.340
look every child in the eyes and decide in your own mind,

47:41.220 --> 47:43.700
are any of these kids going to be funeral directors?

47:44.580 --> 47:49.780
Because if so, what you're doing is incredibly educational.

47:49.780 --> 47:54.660
Do you have one particularly spooky student?

47:54.660 --> 47:56.020
You know the type I'm talking about

47:56.020 --> 47:58.500
and I'm not telling you to put your kids in a box.

47:58.500 --> 47:59.380
I'm just saying.

47:59.380 --> 48:02.020
We're also not saying every funeral director is spooky.

48:02.020 --> 48:04.420
I'm saying that absolutely.

48:04.420 --> 48:06.260
You have one student that comes to class

48:06.260 --> 48:08.420
in a big top hat and a big dirty dark frock.

48:08.420 --> 48:10.180
Not every funeral director is spooky.

48:10.980 --> 48:12.580
Some of them just needed some fast cash.

48:14.100 --> 48:14.980
People get in binds.

48:15.540 --> 48:18.660
In a hot, high stakes world of directing funerals,

48:19.380 --> 48:21.620
how do you need a director for a funeral?

48:21.620 --> 48:24.500
It's not a fucking James Cameron flick.

48:24.500 --> 48:27.060
It's like, here's the box, go do the weeping and all.

48:27.060 --> 48:29.060
Not for mine, buddy.

48:29.060 --> 48:31.540
Mine pyrotechnics, light shows.

48:31.540 --> 48:32.740
Where do we put the flowers?

48:32.740 --> 48:36.020
We better hire somebody to tell us where the flowers.

48:36.020 --> 48:38.580
Hey, my grandpa's up there.

48:38.580 --> 48:42.180
Can you tell me, am I supposed to do sad?

48:44.180 --> 48:46.500
If you're in the funeral biz or your family is

48:46.500 --> 48:47.940
and you're about to start tweeting at us,

48:47.940 --> 48:49.780
just please only direct those at Griffin

48:49.780 --> 48:51.860
because I do not need the existential crisis

48:51.860 --> 48:54.660
when I'm trying to just hang on for dear life.

48:54.660 --> 48:57.940
So please just direct those funeral related tweets at Ditto.

48:57.940 --> 48:59.940
No, funeral directors are a good job

48:59.940 --> 49:03.460
and people who do it are valuable and Tim Allen sucks shit.

49:03.460 --> 49:05.460
Let's just do all the disclaimers at the end of the show.

49:06.900 --> 49:09.460
M. Night Shyamalan is my favorite funeral director

49:09.460 --> 49:11.460
because you walk out to the casket

49:11.460 --> 49:13.860
and you look at him and go, wait, I'm in there, twist.

49:13.860 --> 49:17.300
Yeah, it's me in there and he's me and I'm him.

49:17.300 --> 49:17.800
Uh-oh.

49:18.740 --> 49:19.620
Twist.

49:19.620 --> 49:20.500
There's the twist.

49:21.460 --> 49:23.700
Man, students will do fucking anything

49:23.700 --> 49:26.980
to get out of reading a book for even like a minute, huh?

49:26.980 --> 49:27.480
Uh-huh.

49:29.620 --> 49:32.740
We can twist this and have fun with it for as long as we want,

49:32.740 --> 49:37.380
but this is a lot like when we were doing Spanish class

49:37.380 --> 49:40.660
in high school and we knew our teacher really liked Finding Nemo

49:40.660 --> 49:42.660
and so we just swore up and down like,

49:42.660 --> 49:45.060
I feel like just watching Finding Nemo

49:45.060 --> 49:48.900
with the Spanish subtitles on is the best way for me to absorb this.

49:48.900 --> 49:50.900
So just go ahead and put that one on again

49:50.900 --> 49:54.260
and that right there is good teaching.

49:54.260 --> 49:56.740
I had a teacher named Mr. Sheets in middle school

49:56.740 --> 50:04.100
and he taught us algebra and Mr. Sheets also loved the Civil War.

50:04.100 --> 50:05.700
He was like a Civil War reenactor.

50:06.660 --> 50:10.100
So when we would like want to throw things off the rails,

50:10.100 --> 50:12.820
we would just ask him a question about the Civil War

50:12.820 --> 50:16.820
and in the moment, I felt very like smarmy about it.

50:16.820 --> 50:18.740
Like, oh, we got him.

50:18.740 --> 50:20.260
But then looking back on it,

50:20.260 --> 50:23.140
I realized I learned a lot about the Civil War in that class.

50:23.140 --> 50:24.500
So he kind of got me.

50:24.500 --> 50:26.900
He kind of still did get me.

50:26.900 --> 50:29.780
I wonder if more classes would be more effective

50:29.780 --> 50:32.820
if teachers like use this sort of strategy.

50:32.820 --> 50:36.100
Like on paper, you're the math teacher,

50:36.100 --> 50:38.980
but secretly, you know, it's all about geometry.

50:38.980 --> 50:40.740
So you feel like you're pulling one over on him

50:40.740 --> 50:43.140
whenever you're hearing about geometry,

50:43.140 --> 50:44.900
but really that was the plan all along.

50:45.620 --> 50:48.660
I mean, it's a failure, I think, of the class.

50:48.660 --> 50:53.540
If I go to lit class and I learn about biology, that's cool.

50:53.540 --> 50:56.100
But it's not really what I signed up for.

50:56.100 --> 50:57.700
It's not the credit that I think.

50:57.700 --> 51:01.140
I'm gonna show up to, you know, lit two in college

51:01.140 --> 51:02.900
and be like, all right, time to talk about Dickens.

51:02.900 --> 51:04.020
And he'll be like, I don't know what that is,

51:04.020 --> 51:05.540
but I can tell you what a...

51:05.540 --> 51:07.380
Well, the teachers would need a system

51:07.380 --> 51:09.380
where all the subjects would still be covered.

51:09.380 --> 51:12.580
The secret subjects would cover all the bases.

51:12.580 --> 51:13.700
It's just one to the left.

51:14.580 --> 51:16.660
Yeah, there you go. Thank you. Yes, exactly.

51:18.500 --> 51:19.220
This might be weird,

51:19.220 --> 51:21.460
but as long as we're talking about West Virginia teachers,

51:21.460 --> 51:24.020
we should mention that all the schools in West Virginia

51:24.020 --> 51:26.340
are closed because all the teachers at public schools

51:26.340 --> 51:29.620
are on strike because they got fucked

51:29.620 --> 51:31.780
by the state legislature.

51:32.900 --> 51:36.020
And you should go support them however you can.

51:37.220 --> 51:40.180
They're trying to get a 5% pay raise

51:40.180 --> 51:42.340
instead of the shitty 2% pay raise,

51:42.340 --> 51:45.060
which doesn't cover rising cost of insurance,

51:45.060 --> 51:46.900
which used to be covered.

51:46.900 --> 51:48.660
The tripling cost of insurance.

51:48.660 --> 51:49.160
Right.

51:49.160 --> 51:50.900
It's absolutely madness.

51:50.900 --> 51:52.340
There was a state resource

51:52.340 --> 51:55.380
to pay for public educators' insurance

51:55.380 --> 51:56.500
that is no longer funded,

51:56.500 --> 51:58.340
which is something that they are also fighting for.

51:58.340 --> 52:00.260
So we're very proud of them.

52:00.260 --> 52:02.180
Literally every teacher in all 55 counties

52:02.180 --> 52:04.740
are fighting back to try and get these things.

52:04.740 --> 52:05.940
And schools have been closed for,

52:05.940 --> 52:08.100
I think this is the fourth day today of the strike.

52:08.100 --> 52:09.860
I believe so.

52:09.860 --> 52:11.460
Technically work stoppage, technically.

52:11.460 --> 52:12.580
Work stoppage, yes.

52:12.580 --> 52:13.380
I don't know what the difference is.

52:13.380 --> 52:14.740
There's a whole thing.

52:14.740 --> 52:15.380
It's a whole thing.

52:16.340 --> 52:17.620
Yeah, I figured we should mention that

52:17.620 --> 52:18.900
because we made jokes here,

52:18.900 --> 52:20.420
but we had good teachers growing up

52:20.420 --> 52:24.820
and they deserve to be compensated and taken care of.

52:24.820 --> 52:27.620
And Reese Witherspoon tweeted about this work stoppage.

52:27.620 --> 52:28.100
I heard.

52:28.100 --> 52:29.300
That's what I heard.

52:29.300 --> 52:30.020
We got Reese on our side.

52:30.020 --> 52:32.660
Reese Witherspoon teaches in West Virginia?

52:32.660 --> 52:33.780
No, no, she just tweeted.

52:34.340 --> 52:35.460
Speaking of the end of the show,

52:36.580 --> 52:37.460
this is it.

52:37.460 --> 52:38.500
You've reached it.

52:38.500 --> 52:39.140
We've done it.

52:39.860 --> 52:41.220
We've beaten the odds.

52:41.220 --> 52:42.180
I've beaten the odds.

52:42.180 --> 52:43.140
I guess Travis too.

52:43.140 --> 52:44.180
Hey, Trav, do you have like,

52:44.180 --> 52:45.860
I meant to ask you much earlier.

52:45.860 --> 52:48.340
Do you have like wobbly legs

52:48.340 --> 52:51.060
you're adjusting back to land life?

52:51.060 --> 52:52.420
Not wobbly legs so much

52:52.420 --> 52:53.380
as I'll just be sitting there

52:53.380 --> 52:55.380
and suddenly feel like I'm falling over.

52:55.380 --> 52:56.820
Oh, that's the pits.

52:56.820 --> 52:57.700
It's great.

52:57.700 --> 52:58.900
I'm loving it.

52:58.900 --> 53:00.260
It's kind of exciting, I guess.

53:00.260 --> 53:00.980
In all seriousness,

53:00.980 --> 53:02.180
really was an absolute blast.

53:02.180 --> 53:03.540
I want to say thank you again

53:03.540 --> 53:06.420
to Joko Cruz for having me and my wife

53:06.420 --> 53:08.020

They might be, Giants is gonna be on it.

53:19.220 --> 53:20.660
It's leaving from, I believe,

53:20.660 --> 53:22.660
the East Coast, Florida this year.

53:23.780 --> 53:25.380
Yeah, they're doing the Caribbean this year.

53:25.380 --> 53:25.880
What?

53:26.420 --> 53:27.940
They're doing the Caribbean next year.

53:27.940 --> 53:30.340
Yeah, it's gonna be super fun.

53:30.340 --> 53:30.980
Go check it out.

53:32.340 --> 53:33.700

53:50.340 --> 53:51.460
Where's that at, scrubs?

53:51.460 --> 53:52.660
It's in Austin, Texas.

53:53.780 --> 53:54.500
Hello there.

53:55.140 --> 53:56.100
I want to thank John Roderick

53:56.100 --> 53:57.060

53:58.260 --> 53:59.300
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

53:59.300 --> 54:01.060
It's a fantastic album

54:01.060 --> 54:02.900
and you're just gonna love the shit out of it.

54:02.900 --> 54:04.420

54:21.060 --> 54:22.100
Here comes that final.

54:22.100 --> 54:23.780
It was sent in by Merritt Palmer.

54:23.780 --> 54:24.420
Thank you, Merritt.

54:24.420 --> 54:26.020
It's Yahoo Answers user.

54:26.020 --> 54:27.540
They're anonymous and for good reason

54:27.540 --> 54:29.220
because their perverse question is,

54:31.060 --> 54:33.140
where can I find scented candles

54:33.140 --> 54:35.220
that smell like new Band-Aids?

54:38.340 --> 54:39.540
My name is Justin McElroy.

54:39.540 --> 54:40.660
I'm Travis McElroy.

54:40.660 --> 54:42.180
I'm Griffin McElroy.

54:42.180 --> 54:43.460
This has been my brother, my brother, me.

54:43.460 --> 54:44.100
Kiss your dad.

54:44.100 --> 55:10.660
Square on the lips.

55:14.100 --> 55:19.220
Only one podcast is brave enough to call bullshit.

55:19.220 --> 55:20.260
Who Shot Ya?

55:22.980 --> 55:25.220
The podcast that dares to say

55:25.220 --> 55:28.580
that white dude's opinions aren't the only opinions.

55:28.580 --> 55:30.580
If you have a movie pass,

55:30.580 --> 55:33.380
like get a ticket to it to support Taraji,

55:33.380 --> 55:34.180
then go home.

55:34.180 --> 55:37.700
Ant-Man seems so unnecessary at this point.

55:37.700 --> 55:41.060
Ant-Man is like a ketchup packet too many.

55:41.060 --> 55:42.340
Who Shot Ya?

55:42.340 --> 55:43.860
With Ricky Carmona.

55:43.860 --> 55:45.620
I wanted to see Wolverine kick ass

55:45.620 --> 55:47.380
and eat some popcorn and have a good time.

55:47.380 --> 55:48.980
Alonzo Duralde.

55:48.980 --> 55:50.100
Is this Andy Richter?

55:52.900 --> 55:54.420
And April Wolf.

55:54.420 --> 55:57.060
I love wild things because I get to see Kevin Bacon's dick.

55:58.020 --> 55:59.060
Who Shot Ya?

55:59.060 --> 56:01.300
Listen every Friday on Maximum Fun

56:01.300 --> 56:16.100
or wherever you get your podcasts.
