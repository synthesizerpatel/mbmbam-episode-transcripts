00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:49.200
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:49.200 --> 00:53.760
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:54.320 --> 00:57.920
Happy hump day, weirdos. I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:57.920 --> 01:00.080
Okay. It's Wednesday.

01:00.080 --> 01:04.000
Oh, okay. But, I mean, not when people are listening to this. So, we got an email

01:05.200 --> 01:13.120
to the My Brother, My Brother, Me email from Lydia, and Lydia shared with us a list of 200

01:13.120 --> 01:21.200
questions for conversation starters from ConversationStartersWorld.com, and the list

01:21.200 --> 01:27.200
is titled Questions to Ask a Guy. And the beginning of the description says,

01:27.200 --> 01:31.920
here's a great set of questions to ask a guy to get him talking. They are designed to get

01:31.920 --> 01:37.360
an interesting conversation started, but still keep it relatively casual. And folks,

01:37.360 --> 01:41.280
these questions are fucking bonkers. Well, this is good, Travis, because

01:42.320 --> 01:45.760
we're just three guys being dudes in this show. I know, right?

01:45.760 --> 01:51.200
And so, what a better way to get us going, get our sort of talk rocks off,

01:51.200 --> 01:56.000
than to just sort of get some convo starties. And you know what? This represents the beginning

01:56.000 --> 01:58.400
of a conversation, doesn't it? Right. And also, at this point,

01:58.400 --> 02:01.760
if we're looking to keep the conversation going, we've been going almost 450 episodes,

02:01.760 --> 02:05.600
we're starting to run out of things to talk about. So, let me ask you this, question number three,

02:06.160 --> 02:09.600
and remember, these are questions designed to keep the conversation going,

02:09.600 --> 02:13.280
but keep it relatively casual. For big guys.

02:13.280 --> 02:16.320
Yeah. Question number three, you wake up suddenly in the middle of the night,

02:16.320 --> 02:18.720
what would be the scariest sound you hear after waking up?

02:19.280 --> 02:23.040
Oh, man. When I'm trying to get to know guys, when I'm trying to like, you know,

02:23.040 --> 02:27.120
I've joined a football club and I want to get to know the other guys, this is always a good one.

02:27.120 --> 02:31.600
We like to bandy this one about. Hey, Theo. Hey, bud. What's the late

02:31.600 --> 02:39.680
night terror for you? What's the dark beating heart of the yawning void inside your soul, Theo?

02:39.680 --> 02:44.080
Hey, dude, pass me a Sprite and tell me about your greatest fears.

02:44.080 --> 02:49.520
I enjoy question 18. Which historical figure wasn't as amazing as most people think they were?

02:50.240 --> 02:52.800
Hey, you want to dunk on Ben Franklin with me, Doug?

02:52.800 --> 02:55.280
Come on, Buzz. Let's get Abe. It's time.

02:57.280 --> 03:00.480
This is the one that I would like us to actually spend some time answering,

03:00.480 --> 03:06.080
because this is the one that I think, if you asked a guy to keep the conversation going,

03:06.080 --> 03:13.120
this would go totally normal. Question 19, you are in charge of making insects a popular food item.

03:13.120 --> 03:17.360
You have one billion US dollars to achieve your goal. How do you do it?

03:17.360 --> 03:21.360
Oh, my God. That's actually one of the best conversations I've ever heard in my entire life.

03:21.360 --> 03:26.880
Yeah, I walk up to a guy and say this. So it's like, hey, so glad you agreed

03:26.880 --> 03:30.160
to come on this blind date with me. Also, you're in charge of making

03:30.160 --> 03:35.040
insects a popular food item, and you have one US billion dollars to achieve your goal.

03:35.040 --> 03:38.240
How do you do it? Well, I'll tell you,

03:38.800 --> 03:42.160
billion bucks buys a lot of marshmallows you can hide bugs inside.

03:42.160 --> 03:44.720
Oh, that's good. So that's step one,

03:44.720 --> 03:48.480
and I could probably pay some people to get stuffing.

03:48.480 --> 03:53.920
Let me be clear, to make bugs a popular food item, you would hide them in marshmallows,

03:53.920 --> 03:56.240
and then after like a year of people eating marshmallows, be like,

03:56.240 --> 03:59.200
hey, did you like those marshmallows? There were bugs in them.

03:59.200 --> 04:03.840
Listen, if things as they are today in 2019 have taught me anything,

04:03.840 --> 04:10.560
it's that if you have a billion dollars, you cannot disperse it to people who need it much,

04:10.560 --> 04:14.560
much more than you. You have to spend it on space rockets.

04:14.560 --> 04:17.360
You have to spend it on bug marshmallows.

04:17.360 --> 04:19.360
Bug marshmallows. So yeah, Trav,

04:19.360 --> 04:21.840
I think I'm leaning in the right direction on this one.

04:21.840 --> 04:25.520
Okay. I'd rebrand everything.

04:25.520 --> 04:30.400
I would make it illegal to say roach. I would make it illegal to say moth.

04:30.400 --> 04:36.240
I would make it illegal to say mosquito. They would be replaced with Fritos 2.

04:36.240 --> 04:38.880
Okay. New nachos.

04:40.880 --> 04:44.320
Two. Guy Fieri presents moths.

04:44.320 --> 04:48.560
Guy Fieri's Turbo Moths.

04:48.560 --> 04:53.040
This is a different plan to bring on celebrities to endorse.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.760
I enjoyed that one too, though. I would spend a billion dollars-

04:55.760 --> 04:58.720
Guy Fieri's Dangerously Cheesy Moths.

04:58.720 --> 05:01.680
Yeah. Pizza-licious roaches.

05:03.760 --> 05:06.480
Hugh Grant's Pizza-licious roaches.

05:06.480 --> 05:09.200
Hey, it's me, Margot Robbie. Eat a cricket.

05:09.200 --> 05:13.520
Oh, I do. I love them.

05:13.520 --> 05:19.600
I had to spend a billion dollars hiring crop dusters to fly over bugs and drop.

05:19.600 --> 05:22.480
Just get them. Yeah, put some salt on them or something.

05:23.600 --> 05:26.480
Make them taste better. And then you're like, they're delicious now.

05:28.560 --> 05:33.520
Maybe some kind of viral challenge. Spend a billion dollars getting them.

05:33.520 --> 05:36.880
I didn't even think about that. Get them eating bugs for a challenge.

05:36.880 --> 05:40.160
The bug eating, the snowpiercer challenge.

05:40.160 --> 05:43.120
Gotta get a Netflix sort of movie about it first.

05:43.120 --> 05:48.160
So we get Sandra Bullock back for Bird Box 2. This one's called Bug Box.

05:48.160 --> 05:55.360
And instead of using the Bird Box as a cudgel to beat the monsters, didn't see it.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.240
But people loved it and started to meme it pretty hard.

05:58.240 --> 06:01.280
So in this one, it's a box full of bugs, but she opens it up and she's like,

06:01.280 --> 06:05.120
oh, actually these look delicious. Are these covered in pizza dust?

06:05.120 --> 06:08.240
And Guy Fieri pokes out and he's like, yeah. And then the monster gets him,

06:08.240 --> 06:10.720
but she eats them and now Bob's your uncle.

06:10.720 --> 06:12.640
Teen's gotta eat this for their Snapchat story.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.040
I got a way to force everybody to eat bugs.

06:15.040 --> 06:15.760
All right.

06:15.760 --> 06:21.040
Just wait. Just wait. Well, it'll happen.

06:21.600 --> 06:24.400
We're gonna get there. There's no need to rush.

06:24.400 --> 06:27.280
We're all gonna be eating bugs here before too long.

06:27.280 --> 06:30.400
Let's not rush it. Let's just enjoy bread while we got it.

06:30.400 --> 06:36.640
Justin with that extremely specific Alex Jones sort of stuff that he's dropping.

06:36.640 --> 06:41.760
And you know what? That's fine. It's dense protein and fuck bugs.

06:41.760 --> 06:43.520
Yeah. That's good bugs.

06:43.520 --> 06:49.840
And also people all over the world that just aren't right here are eating them already.

06:49.840 --> 06:54.240
Yeah. They're like, pass the bugs over here.

06:54.240 --> 06:57.680
They're afraid that we're gonna find out about bugs.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.280
How good bugs are.

06:59.280 --> 07:00.160
Yeah.

07:00.160 --> 07:02.000
And good for you. God.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.680
And if you watch Shark Tank, half of things are bugs now.

07:05.680 --> 07:09.120
If you watch Shark Tank, half of all food products do have bugs in them.

07:10.640 --> 07:11.600
Yeah. Bugs is good.

07:11.600 --> 07:14.080
I feel like I've talked about this on the show more than once,

07:14.080 --> 07:16.880
but I see the Hakuna Matata scene where they ate the big fat grubs.

07:16.880 --> 07:20.560
And I've always found that scene incredibly inexplicably appetizing.

07:20.560 --> 07:25.200
I want to eat the grubby bug that has the juice that comes out of it because I want to know.

07:25.200 --> 07:28.400
They eat them like it's a women's sampler.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.680
And it looks so good.

07:29.680 --> 07:32.400
When he sucks the big one down.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.080
When he sucks that big one.

07:34.080 --> 07:37.600
He sucks that big one down and it looks so just like plump and rising.

07:37.600 --> 07:39.920
It's just like, I want to know maybe.

07:39.920 --> 07:44.320
We often struggle with how to pitch our podcast to people.

07:44.320 --> 07:50.720
I think from now on, it would be easiest to say it's the sort of show

07:50.720 --> 07:54.880
where my brother Griffin has had more than one opportunity

07:54.880 --> 07:58.800
to talk about how delicious he thinks the bugs in Lion King look.

07:58.800 --> 08:01.440
Yep. So it's that kind of program.

08:01.440 --> 08:07.280
Well, in my defense, they give you, I believe, yelling energy in the Lion King video game.

08:07.280 --> 08:07.760
Correct.

08:07.760 --> 08:09.840
So I feel a sort of attachment or health.

08:09.840 --> 08:11.520
It's either health or yelling energy.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.960
And second of all, if they start to get on my case about that,

08:14.960 --> 08:17.520
good thing that scene has a little message

08:17.520 --> 08:20.560
that will help me get through the strife that that will cause.

08:21.760 --> 08:22.640
What is that message?

08:23.360 --> 08:24.400
You know what it is.

08:24.400 --> 08:29.680
It's trademark, but it rhymes with hakuda mabada.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.080
It doesn't actually.

08:32.880 --> 08:33.920
It kind of does.

08:33.920 --> 08:34.320
Okay.

08:36.000 --> 08:36.720
Raccoona.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.280
Chabata.

08:41.280 --> 08:41.840
Chabata.

08:42.880 --> 08:46.000
Raccoona chabata.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.680
Draguna chubaca.

08:50.560 --> 08:53.760
Fetsuna frittata.

08:53.760 --> 08:57.120
Dragoon chubaca is my favorite character in Kingdom Hearts 3.

08:57.120 --> 09:00.000
Kingdom Hearts 3 is out, and I'd love to talk about it.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.520
We can't keep dipping in.

09:01.520 --> 09:02.400
We can't keep dipping in.

09:02.400 --> 09:06.480
I've been told I'm not allowed to, but boy, Siri wants to get in.

09:08.400 --> 09:12.000
Siri just thinks I said to it, Kingdom Hearts 3 is out, and I love it.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.760
Oh man, I hope Google and Siri and all that shit aren't listening

09:17.760 --> 09:19.920
because I just fucked my whole thing.

09:19.920 --> 09:22.800
My whole internet ad thing is ruined.

09:22.800 --> 09:28.160
Tim Cook, while sitting on his Sora, Riku, Kairi bedspread,

09:28.160 --> 09:32.080
just got a notification on his computer, and he's like, ah, good.

09:32.080 --> 09:32.720
We got him.

09:32.720 --> 09:33.440
We got him.

09:33.440 --> 09:38.320
Hey, don't fucking give me a link to that great Reply All episode

09:38.320 --> 09:40.720
about how those things aren't listening to us.

09:40.720 --> 09:42.080
Please, please.

09:42.080 --> 09:42.720
I heard it.

09:42.720 --> 09:43.200
It's great.

09:43.200 --> 09:43.520
I get it.

09:43.520 --> 09:44.320
It was just a joke.

09:44.320 --> 09:44.880
Damn.

09:44.880 --> 09:46.240
God, it was just a joke.

09:46.240 --> 09:47.920
Yeah, you really looked eastward there.

09:47.920 --> 09:48.960
Hey, let's do show.

09:49.760 --> 09:50.960
Let's do show.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.960
It's an advice show.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.840
Recently, my best friend's parents, who I am not that close to-

09:55.840 --> 09:57.040
Fuck you, Marjorie.

09:57.040 --> 09:57.360
Boom.

09:58.080 --> 09:58.800
Boom.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.640
You thought we were friends, but we ain't.

10:00.640 --> 10:02.800
Doug, Marjorie, eat my ass.

10:02.800 --> 10:03.600
What's up?

10:03.600 --> 10:05.840
No, I will not give you a ride to the airport.

10:05.840 --> 10:07.040
Fuck off.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.160
Let me finish, please.

10:08.160 --> 10:08.800
Sorry.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.680
Invited me over for a dinner of pizza and chicken wings

10:12.320 --> 10:14.240
before I would be house-sitting for them.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.120
Please, everybody, it's hard enough for you to read.

10:17.120 --> 10:20.160
Stop wording things in the weirdest possible way.

10:20.160 --> 10:22.640
I will have a dinner of pizza and chicken wings.

10:23.520 --> 10:26.960
Present to me, Krogan, a dinner of pizza

10:27.520 --> 10:28.720
before I would be house-

10:28.720 --> 10:31.120
Okay, a dinner of pizza and chicken wings

10:31.120 --> 10:33.120
before I would be house-sitting for them.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.920
Partway through the meal, my friend's mom said,

10:35.920 --> 10:39.040
oh, hang on, fished a fork out of the drawer

10:39.040 --> 10:42.880
and handed it to me and said, for the wings.

10:42.880 --> 10:43.440
This is fake.

10:44.240 --> 10:46.080
Fake question duped again.

10:46.080 --> 10:46.880
Duped again.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.800
You almost got one by the McElroy boys,

10:48.800 --> 10:52.000
but we weren't born, I was born during the day,

10:52.000 --> 10:54.320
but not during, but not yesterday.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.120
So next question.

10:55.120 --> 10:55.600
Is this a fake?

10:55.600 --> 10:56.160
Next question.

10:57.120 --> 10:57.840
This is a fake?

10:57.840 --> 10:59.360
Scoop this one in the garbage can, yeah.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.240
Wait, why are you so sure?

11:02.240 --> 11:03.440
Scoop it right in the garbage can.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.360
This person doesn't exist, no way.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.480
Fork winger, no way.

11:07.200 --> 11:07.920
Out the window at this point.

11:07.920 --> 11:09.520
Debra fork winger, get out of here.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.000
Dump this one in the front yard.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.400
Let it fertilize the roses, no way.

11:15.680 --> 11:17.520
A wing forker, stop it.

11:17.520 --> 11:19.280
Not wanting to be rude, I took it,

11:19.280 --> 11:21.440
but not understanding how she wanted me to use it

11:21.440 --> 11:23.200
and seeing as no one else was using one,

11:23.200 --> 11:26.000
I sort of awkwardly placed it on my napkin.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.400
For the rest of the meal, I became increasingly paranoid.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.240
She was noticing me not using the fork.

11:31.280 --> 11:34.640
And then I was being very rude by not doing so,

11:34.640 --> 11:36.160
despite me being completely bewildered

11:36.160 --> 11:38.000
as to how to use a fork for a chicken wing.

11:38.640 --> 11:40.320
Brothers, why did she give me the fork?

11:41.040 --> 11:43.520
Is there some new fork technique I did not get told about?

11:44.080 --> 11:45.200
They've done it.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.480
They've cracked it.

11:46.480 --> 11:48.960
What should I have done in this situation

11:48.960 --> 11:50.640
to avoid offending my hosts?

11:50.640 --> 11:53.680
That's fork faux pas in California.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.440
There's a few possibilities here,

11:55.440 --> 11:58.320
and I'm gonna give you one from my files,

11:58.320 --> 12:00.240
from the J files we call them.

12:01.120 --> 12:06.640
When I am eating the flats,

12:07.680 --> 12:09.600
not the drums, but the flaties.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.440
When I'm eating the flaties,

12:11.440 --> 12:15.680
sometimes I'll get a little bit,

12:15.680 --> 12:18.960
there'll be a little bit of that succulent chicken

12:18.960 --> 12:22.160
in between the two bones that make up the flat.

12:22.160 --> 12:24.800
Which is rude of the chicken to hide its meat in there.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.360
Hide that delicious meat for yourself.

12:28.320 --> 12:31.040
So sometimes I'll stick my tongue in there

12:31.920 --> 12:33.360
like that to jam it out.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.400
So the reason why I'm saying this

12:36.400 --> 12:39.280
is that I'm just realizing it at the moment

12:39.280 --> 12:42.160
that that visual palette that I would be presenting there

12:42.160 --> 12:44.400
would be challenging at best.

12:44.400 --> 12:47.200
Especially since you are not that close to it.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.920
So they have not seen this display before now.

12:49.920 --> 12:52.640
It's possible that it's just an inbuilt genetic thing

12:52.640 --> 12:54.800
that some rowdy folks do.

12:56.240 --> 12:57.920
If you maybe pulled this stunt,

12:58.480 --> 13:00.480
I think that maybe they observed it.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.320
Maybe if they observed the stunt,

13:02.320 --> 13:03.520
they might say like,

13:03.520 --> 13:06.880
actually we're gonna go ahead and get you a fork.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.000
Cause we can't,

13:08.640 --> 13:10.000
cause it's Sunday,

13:10.000 --> 13:11.280
we just got back from church

13:11.280 --> 13:13.200
and you're doing wing-a-lingus over here.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.360
Kind of wing-us.

13:21.120 --> 13:22.560
Was it a special like tiny,

13:22.560 --> 13:25.840
like a shrimp fork for wings?

13:26.560 --> 13:27.600
Now that could be useful.

13:27.600 --> 13:28.880
I would love that.

13:28.880 --> 13:30.560
I would hope they would mention it's a shrimp fork

13:30.560 --> 13:32.160
if it was a fucking shrimp fork.

13:32.160 --> 13:32.800
Wowzers.

13:32.800 --> 13:33.040
Yeah.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.120
I mean, you probably had some ragged action on your eating

13:35.120 --> 13:37.680
and the fact that she didn't offer it to anybody else

13:37.680 --> 13:38.800
means that you did the worst job

13:38.800 --> 13:40.320
of eating the wings at the table.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.320
And you can't take that personally,

13:42.320 --> 13:43.760
but there's lots of YouTube tutorials

13:43.760 --> 13:45.120
about how to do it good.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.720
And don't be ashamed to ask for help.

13:47.920 --> 13:48.720
Maybe it was just-

13:48.720 --> 13:49.600
The big game coming,

13:49.600 --> 13:51.040
oh shit, this is gonna be after the big game.

13:51.040 --> 13:52.640
Well, you'll catch it 2020 probably.

13:52.640 --> 13:53.200
Yeah.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.120
Or maybe you'll watch a re-watch,

13:55.120 --> 13:57.920
like maybe you like videotaped the big game.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.000
Hopefully by then football will have been outlawed.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.680
Hopefully, fingers crossed.

14:01.680 --> 14:04.480
Now it's possible that maybe this is just a matter

14:04.480 --> 14:06.240
of like the parents,

14:06.240 --> 14:10.080
they love each other and they love your friend,

14:10.080 --> 14:11.680
but they're not sure on you yet.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.120
So if parents or friends,

14:13.120 --> 14:16.160
if family members got wing stains on the table,

14:16.160 --> 14:17.440
they can forgive that.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.480
But if you wing stain the tablecloth,

14:21.040 --> 14:24.800
they might like then not trust you to then house it

14:24.800 --> 14:26.800
and they have to cancel their vacation.

14:26.800 --> 14:30.480
So this might just be like a defense mechanism

14:30.480 --> 14:33.680
so that you don't ruin their trip to like,

14:34.240 --> 14:36.640
I don't know, to Barbados or wherever they're going.

14:36.640 --> 14:37.520
Where are they going?

14:37.520 --> 14:39.680
Why didn't you include that in the question?

14:39.680 --> 14:40.960
This is important data that I need to know.

14:40.960 --> 14:41.920
No, it's not.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.440
Are you the only one who potentially

14:43.440 --> 14:46.000
did not get bone full wings?

14:46.000 --> 14:48.240
And in fact would find your wings to be bone less.

14:49.600 --> 14:50.800
And so by eating those with your hands,

14:50.800 --> 14:51.840
you're a wild animal.

14:51.840 --> 14:52.880
Wait, why is that, Griffin?

14:52.880 --> 14:54.400
That seems like a double standard.

14:54.400 --> 14:55.760
I've made it easier to eat

14:55.760 --> 14:58.080
and therefore now I have to introduce utensils?

14:59.040 --> 15:00.240
Yeah, yeah.

15:00.240 --> 15:02.480
Hey folks, folks aren't out there eating.

15:02.480 --> 15:02.960
Wow, huh?

15:02.960 --> 15:04.480
This is a double standard though.

15:04.480 --> 15:06.480
I will eat a wing wing with my hands.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.600
And you know, using Justin's technique,

15:09.600 --> 15:11.520
sometimes my tongue and my heart.

15:13.920 --> 15:15.280
But in a chicken tender,

15:15.280 --> 15:16.720
you know I'm gonna hand that one.

15:16.720 --> 15:19.200
That one's getting handed and dippid and mouthed.

15:19.840 --> 15:23.920
But a buffalo, a boneless guy, a buffalo wing,

15:23.920 --> 15:25.680
if you eat that with your hands,

15:25.680 --> 15:27.120
you're a dog in the street.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.360
It's just a small tender or,

15:32.400 --> 15:35.120
you know, the bone full wings flop of your cousin.

15:35.120 --> 15:36.800
Why can't I eat that with my hands?

15:36.800 --> 15:40.560
Mm, what about like popcorn chicken?

15:40.560 --> 15:42.000
Popcorn chicken's hand, of course.

15:42.000 --> 15:42.960
If you eat that with a fork,

15:42.960 --> 15:44.400
you're out of your gourd, man.

15:44.400 --> 15:47.680
Right, so why is it just the boneless wing

15:48.240 --> 15:50.000
with the whole game done changed?

15:50.000 --> 15:52.480
Yeah, well we helped them enough.

15:52.480 --> 15:53.600
How about a yahoo?

15:53.600 --> 15:54.720
Okay, I love that, Griffin.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.080
This one was sent in by Sid Ross.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.360
Sid sent a bunch of great ones in.

15:57.360 --> 15:57.840
Thank you, Sid.

15:57.840 --> 15:59.360
It's an anonymous yahoo answers user

15:59.360 --> 16:02.640
who I'm gonna call the Quaker Oats guy.

16:02.640 --> 16:05.200
Looking at him, he looks regal, regal beagle.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.120
Cool, Quaker Oats guy asks.

16:07.120 --> 16:09.920
Is there an ad for Quaker Oats on your desktop right now?

16:09.920 --> 16:11.200
Like on the screen, or?

16:11.200 --> 16:12.400
No, it's just my desktop background

16:12.400 --> 16:13.440
is an ad for Quaker Oats.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.080
I just love them.

16:14.080 --> 16:14.960
I love these guys.

16:16.560 --> 16:17.920
So Quaker Oats guy asks,

16:18.880 --> 16:21.040
and this is like, this is almost a riddle me piss.

16:22.160 --> 16:24.080
It's 1246 a.m.

16:25.120 --> 16:30.480
Is it too early slash late in the day to make tortellini?

16:30.480 --> 16:31.120
I gotta know.

16:31.120 --> 16:36.480
It's 1246 a.m.

16:36.480 --> 16:38.000
And to answer this one,

16:38.000 --> 16:43.120
we really have to look at the whole sort of clock

16:43.120 --> 16:46.480
using 1246 as like the fulcrum of it

16:46.480 --> 16:49.200
and try to figure out is it,

16:50.480 --> 16:54.160
it's almost certainly too early for pasta time.

16:54.160 --> 16:58.480
But yeah, no one's making pasta at least,

16:58.480 --> 17:01.200
you wake up at 630 at the earliest

17:01.200 --> 17:02.640
and maybe start chowing down on pasta,

17:02.640 --> 17:05.200
that seems weird, but you've made it now.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.840
Six hours in advance, it's gonna be not great.

17:07.840 --> 17:09.520
I think it's definitely too early in the day

17:09.520 --> 17:10.400
to have tortellini,

17:10.400 --> 17:12.800
but I guess it's, again, a question of perspective.

17:13.680 --> 17:18.160
Tortellini, what kind of stuffing

17:18.160 --> 17:20.320
are we talking about with this tortellini?

17:20.320 --> 17:25.760
Because it seems like if you got maybe egg

17:25.760 --> 17:29.040
or maybe bacon,

17:29.760 --> 17:33.840
you might have yourself a kind of a breakfast tortellini.

17:33.840 --> 17:36.800
Now, Justin, I would argue that the stuffing

17:36.800 --> 17:38.400
does not change the fact

17:38.400 --> 17:41.360
that this would still be about six hours

17:41.360 --> 17:43.920
before you could justifiably have breakfast.

17:43.920 --> 17:47.200
Yep, I mean, Saturday Night Live just ended.

17:48.240 --> 17:51.760
I'm real horny, gotta work this off

17:51.760 --> 17:54.000
by making my own tortellini

17:54.000 --> 17:55.680
and stuffing it with breakfast.

17:55.680 --> 17:57.200
Wait, are you making it from scratch?

17:57.200 --> 17:59.200
I assume this is like a frozen scenario,

17:59.200 --> 18:00.960
perhaps a refrigerated scenario.

18:01.520 --> 18:03.760
You're like cranking out the dough and everything?

18:05.520 --> 18:06.160
What time was it?

18:06.800 --> 18:09.760
1246 a.m., I'm horny as hell.

18:10.400 --> 18:13.280
SNL just ended, had me a good belly laugh at that one.

18:14.080 --> 18:16.160
And I need a way to work out these jimmies.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.720
Well, now, I don't know how long it takes

18:18.720 --> 18:20.000
to make tortellini from scratch.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.560
1246 might be the right time to start

18:22.560 --> 18:24.320
if you wanna have it for lunch the next day.

18:24.320 --> 18:25.440
It doesn't take a lot.

18:25.440 --> 18:28.720
Any pastas are very quick, they come together quick.

18:28.720 --> 18:30.000
You put them in the machine.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.760
No, you're making it from scratch, my man.

18:31.760 --> 18:33.760
From scratch, you come together quick,

18:33.760 --> 18:34.240
you put it in the machine.

18:34.240 --> 18:35.200
You don't know.

18:35.200 --> 18:36.640
You start to get the ingredients,

18:36.640 --> 18:40.560
you put it in the machine, you fold it into shapes,

18:40.560 --> 18:43.120
you wrap it around stuffing, you crimp.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.280
And now it's 6.30 a.m.

18:45.280 --> 18:48.560
If you're on the way, you get the deep fat fryer going,

18:50.080 --> 18:51.600
and then throw it all in the trash

18:51.600 --> 18:52.640
and go to Olive Garden

18:52.640 --> 18:54.400
because you don't know how to make it.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.000
Tortellini certainly seems like maybe

18:58.000 --> 18:59.680
one of the more challenging pastas

18:59.680 --> 19:01.760
to try to make from scratch yourself.

19:01.760 --> 19:07.600
Anything full, it's gonna be tough.

19:07.600 --> 19:10.000
But it's fun because if you get bored of eating it,

19:10.000 --> 19:13.360
you can pick them up and use them as little rings.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.480
I used to do that when I was a kid.

19:14.480 --> 19:16.400
I'd have little tortellini rings

19:16.400 --> 19:18.160
and everyone thought it was really cute.

19:18.160 --> 19:20.320
Oh shit, this is a trick question.

19:20.320 --> 19:20.800
Oh.

19:20.800 --> 19:21.680
Okay.

19:21.680 --> 19:25.680
This person works a shift where they go into work

19:26.560 --> 19:30.400
like 4 a.m. to noon,

19:31.440 --> 19:36.640
and so 12 for them is like their breakfast.

19:36.640 --> 19:38.800
They're having, that's brunch.

19:38.800 --> 19:41.520
Yeah, and the other possibility here-

19:41.520 --> 19:42.720
Postability, please.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.960
The other possibility here, thank you Travis,

19:44.960 --> 19:45.920
my brilliant brother,

19:46.880 --> 19:49.520
is that once you reach a certain age,

19:49.520 --> 19:50.640
you can do whatever the fuck you want,

19:50.640 --> 19:52.000
whenever the fuck you want to.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.240
So you can do this,

19:54.240 --> 19:55.360
but you need some sort of,

19:56.080 --> 19:57.840
all you have to do to justify this,

19:57.840 --> 19:59.520
the only person you have to justify this to

19:59.520 --> 20:01.760
is you, yourself,

20:01.760 --> 20:03.600
and the Holy Spirit that dwells within you.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.280
Because that's the end of the day,

20:05.280 --> 20:07.360
you just gotta be able to fall asleep after this

20:07.360 --> 20:11.440
at 2.15 a.m. after you've made and consumed the tortellini.

20:11.440 --> 20:12.640
If you just treat it like,

20:13.280 --> 20:14.800
okay, so I had dinner,

20:14.800 --> 20:16.880
and then SNL started up,

20:16.880 --> 20:17.920
but during commercial break,

20:17.920 --> 20:20.480
I jetted on down to Taco Bell for fourth meal,

20:20.480 --> 20:21.360
and as everybody knows,

20:21.360 --> 20:24.240
the traditional fifth meal is a homemade pasta

20:24.240 --> 20:25.040
that you made yourself.

20:25.040 --> 20:27.200
It's half a serving of tortellini.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.520
You don't need a full serving, come on.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.560
We're not getting silly here.

20:31.760 --> 20:34.160
This is, can I say, Griffin, to your point?

20:34.160 --> 20:34.720
Thank you.

20:34.720 --> 20:38.000
You reach a certain age where you can eat

20:38.000 --> 20:40.480
and do whatever you want whenever you want,

20:40.480 --> 20:42.880
but your body begins to reject it

20:42.880 --> 20:46.320
in a way that I feel is like inverse and unfair.

20:46.320 --> 20:47.440
Yeah.

20:47.440 --> 20:48.560
When I'm a child,

20:48.560 --> 20:51.360
I could have eaten ice cream every meal,

20:51.360 --> 20:52.720
three to four meals in a day,

20:52.720 --> 20:54.080
but I was not allowed to.

20:54.080 --> 20:55.360
But now at 35,

20:55.360 --> 20:58.640
if I do that in one day, I'll die.

20:58.640 --> 21:00.640
Yeah, when I was a kid,

21:00.640 --> 21:03.200
I would pack three packs of Gushers for my lunch,

21:03.200 --> 21:04.640
and Dad would see that and say,

21:04.640 --> 21:05.200
no, you don't.

21:05.760 --> 21:07.760
And now that I'm an adult,

21:07.760 --> 21:09.280
it's like my body is my dad.

21:12.960 --> 21:14.480
My favorite John Mayer song.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.320
Is that what dad bod means?

21:20.320 --> 21:22.400
As long as you live under my skin,

21:22.400 --> 21:24.080
you'll obey my rules.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.360
Hey, young man.

21:25.360 --> 21:26.160
It's kind of like,

21:26.160 --> 21:28.240
it's kind of like Krang, Griffin.

21:28.240 --> 21:30.320
The brain that lives in your belly

21:30.320 --> 21:32.640
pilots the entire operation.

21:32.640 --> 21:33.680
That's kind of what you're feeling.

21:33.680 --> 21:36.160
Yes, but it would be like if the rest of Krang was like,

21:36.160 --> 21:37.920
I think I'd like pizza tonight.

21:37.920 --> 21:38.640
And Krang was like,

21:38.640 --> 21:40.800
we'll be up all night with Hi-Bang.

21:41.360 --> 21:43.840
You don't think that that shell

21:43.840 --> 21:46.880
that Krang rode around in did want pizza?

21:46.880 --> 21:47.840
That thing looked,

21:47.840 --> 21:49.840
nothing has ever looked like it wanted pizza

21:49.840 --> 21:51.120
more than Krang's body.

21:52.560 --> 21:55.680
That shell suit is maybe the saddest character

21:55.680 --> 21:58.640
in all of television ever.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.560
He didn't ever get to do anything he wanted.

22:00.560 --> 22:01.440
He wanted to hang out with,

22:01.440 --> 22:03.440
maybe he liked the turtles.

22:03.440 --> 22:07.280
He liked their flips and their pizza.

22:07.280 --> 22:08.880
And he had to fight against them.

22:08.880 --> 22:09.680
That's sad.

22:09.680 --> 22:11.600
Did those cowards ever put Krang in a movie?

22:11.600 --> 22:13.440
I'm gonna say no,

22:13.440 --> 22:14.400
because he would have looked,

22:14.400 --> 22:15.600
if you're talking live action,

22:15.600 --> 22:17.040
he would have looked like a shaved scrotum.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.320
And I think I'd remember that.

22:18.320 --> 22:20.400
Yeah, like tummy nuts.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.160
Here's a quick update.

22:22.800 --> 22:23.520
Quick update.

22:23.520 --> 22:27.760
He appears in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2

22:27.760 --> 22:31.200
and he is voiced by Brad Garrett.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.000
The perfect person.

22:37.760 --> 22:40.240
One person I hope would play Krang.

22:40.240 --> 22:43.360
And Ray Romano does the body's voice.

22:43.360 --> 22:46.320
Ah, you're a traitor.

22:46.320 --> 22:50.080
Traitor, traitor.

22:50.080 --> 22:52.240
I have had this problem for a long time

22:52.240 --> 22:53.600
and I can't get it to end.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.920
People ask me for directions constantly.

22:55.920 --> 22:57.200
I'm not over exaggerating.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.480
No matter where I am or what I'm doing,

22:58.480 --> 22:59.920
some stranger will do their best to flag me

22:59.920 --> 23:01.440
and ask for directions.

23:01.440 --> 23:03.920
I've had a mother pull over to the side of the road,

23:03.920 --> 23:04.800
children in the car,

23:04.800 --> 23:06.400
window rolled down to ask me for help.

23:06.960 --> 23:08.960
I've, why?

23:08.960 --> 23:11.280
Okay, I've had people basically run me down

23:11.280 --> 23:12.880
in the pouring rain for directions.

23:12.880 --> 23:15.040
I've tried wearing noise canceling headphones.

23:15.040 --> 23:16.800
I even tried walking with less confidence,

23:16.800 --> 23:18.080
but none of it helps.

23:18.080 --> 23:19.280
I've been told by my friends

23:19.280 --> 23:21.360
that my resting face looks pissed off.

23:21.360 --> 23:23.520
So why does every person in the world

23:23.520 --> 23:25.520
want to ask you where the bathroom is?

23:25.520 --> 23:27.040
How do I make this stop?

23:27.040 --> 23:28.080
Is it impossible?

23:28.080 --> 23:28.880
Help.

23:28.880 --> 23:30.400
Sincerely, the Minotaur.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.840
No, sorry, I misread it.

23:35.840 --> 23:37.360
For Ava in Lake Forest.

23:37.360 --> 23:39.840
Yeah, I used to think,

23:40.720 --> 23:42.960
so I kind of get where this person's coming from

23:42.960 --> 23:44.160
because I used to think

23:44.160 --> 23:47.920
that I had some sort of weird power

23:47.920 --> 23:51.120
that in public people would just want me

23:52.000 --> 23:55.680
to take their phone or camera and take their picture.

23:55.680 --> 23:56.400
Like we would be,

23:56.400 --> 23:58.880
I remember one time we were walking around in Central Park

23:58.880 --> 24:01.920
and like I got stopped like five different times

24:01.920 --> 24:03.440
so that some couple,

24:03.440 --> 24:04.160
they would like hand me their phone

24:04.160 --> 24:05.760
and be like, can you take a picture of us?

24:05.760 --> 24:06.960
And it happened to me so much

24:06.960 --> 24:09.360
I started to think that there was some sort of weird

24:10.560 --> 24:13.680
like Truman Show shit going on.

24:15.360 --> 24:15.860
Normally.

24:17.440 --> 24:18.880
And then what happened, Griffin?

24:19.760 --> 24:22.560
Well, and then my boat smashed through the wall

24:23.520 --> 24:24.960
and who was back there?

24:24.960 --> 24:25.920
My real wife.

24:27.440 --> 24:28.160
Brad Garrett.

24:29.680 --> 24:31.360
Brad Garrett, my real wife.

24:32.240 --> 24:34.560
Now normally I would chastise this person

24:34.560 --> 24:38.560
because I feel like people coming up to you,

24:39.200 --> 24:40.800
I don't know, where I'm at in my life,

24:40.800 --> 24:41.920
this isn't for everybody,

24:41.920 --> 24:44.480
but like it feels like a mitzvah, right?

24:44.480 --> 24:47.680
It feels like you have this opportunity to help people

24:47.680 --> 24:50.480
and that's like a sort of blessing.

24:50.480 --> 24:52.800
You should be happy that you can help somebody.

24:53.920 --> 24:59.200
One of like the only areas in which I cannot accept

24:59.200 --> 25:01.600
it is in fact giving directions.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.680
I couldn't give anyone directions.

25:03.680 --> 25:06.400
People ask me directions to my home

25:06.400 --> 25:08.400
who are coming to like deliver something

25:08.400 --> 25:09.680
and I can't help them.

25:09.680 --> 25:10.960
I don't know what to tell them.

25:10.960 --> 25:14.080
Like just the phone took that from me.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.160
I don't have that anymore, okay?

25:16.160 --> 25:17.040
The phone took that.

25:17.040 --> 25:18.320
I don't know what anything is.

25:18.320 --> 25:20.240
And you should have a phone too and I know you do.

25:21.600 --> 25:22.560
This is a fun test.

25:23.200 --> 25:28.240
I don't know what the street that feeds into my street is called.

25:29.840 --> 25:32.560
I don't know what the street that goes into my street is called.

25:32.560 --> 25:33.440
I don't know what that is.

25:33.440 --> 25:35.280
I don't know what its name is, which isn't great.

25:35.280 --> 25:37.040
I don't think I do either.

25:37.040 --> 25:37.360
That's not great, boys.

25:37.360 --> 25:38.800
If someone asks me for directions,

25:40.160 --> 25:42.480
if they're not starting from my house,

25:42.480 --> 25:44.160
I don't know what to tell them.

25:44.160 --> 25:46.080
Like, okay, first come to my house

25:46.080 --> 25:48.800
and now I can tell you how to get to the store from there.

25:48.800 --> 25:49.760
I get this a lot.

25:49.760 --> 25:52.800
I think maybe it's because I've worked so many retail jobs,

25:52.800 --> 25:55.520
but I give off a vibe whenever I'm in a store,

25:55.520 --> 25:58.240
I think that I know where stuff is in the store.

25:58.240 --> 26:01.200
I get asked that like if I'm at Home Depot or Kroger

26:01.200 --> 26:04.240
or whatever, people will stop me and ask me specifically

26:04.240 --> 26:05.760
if I know where things are.

26:05.760 --> 26:07.120
You look like a shop boy.

26:07.120 --> 26:08.000
I do.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.720
I do look like, you know, I wear a lot of polos.

26:10.720 --> 26:11.840
So I get it.

26:11.840 --> 26:13.360
I get polos and khakis.

26:13.360 --> 26:14.960
Everyone knows that's my go-to look.

26:14.960 --> 26:16.880
This is why I wear tank tops, guys.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.800
People are only gonna ask you directions to one thing

26:20.800 --> 26:22.320
and that's the bar.

26:24.080 --> 26:25.040
Or a gun show.

26:25.040 --> 26:25.760
Or a gun show.

26:25.760 --> 26:26.720
Or a party.

26:26.720 --> 26:29.120
A gun show would be, yeah.

26:29.120 --> 26:32.080
No, it's not a real gun show, Juice.

26:32.080 --> 26:33.200
Talking about my big arms.

26:33.200 --> 26:34.640
Yeah, because your big arms.

26:34.640 --> 26:35.440
Okay.

26:35.440 --> 26:36.160
Yeah, it was good.

26:38.560 --> 26:41.040
Hold on, I'm writing a note to myself about the good joke

26:41.040 --> 26:41.520
you did.

26:41.520 --> 26:42.480
It was a good joke.

26:42.480 --> 26:43.280
Who needs guns?

26:43.280 --> 26:48.080
I have these big arms and then I would cock my bicep

26:48.080 --> 26:49.440
like it was like a gun.

26:50.960 --> 26:52.240
You would like break your arm?

26:52.800 --> 26:56.160
Yeah, I bend it 90 degrees, but then I bend it right back.

26:56.160 --> 26:59.440
And then what comes out of my elbow?

26:59.440 --> 27:00.240
A little cannon.

27:03.120 --> 27:04.720
A lead a battle angel too.

27:04.720 --> 27:06.160
Griffin is him.

27:06.160 --> 27:09.200
Hey, what's going on with that fucking clip?

27:09.200 --> 27:10.240
Yo, Robert.

27:10.240 --> 27:10.960
Hey, Robert.

27:11.760 --> 27:15.520
Hey, I've been seeing commercials and it kind of looks

27:15.520 --> 27:17.920
like those, you know, there's like we turn the Simpsons

27:17.920 --> 27:19.920
into real people and this is what it looks like.

27:20.560 --> 27:22.640
It's kind of like that and I don't think that movie

27:22.640 --> 27:24.240
should be allowed to come out.

27:24.240 --> 27:27.120
No one asked me about it and I just am not sure that

27:27.120 --> 27:28.720
it should come out because I've been seeing a lot of

27:28.720 --> 27:30.160
pictures from it, Rob.

27:30.160 --> 27:32.400
And I'm just not sure, but I don't know.

27:33.280 --> 27:34.800
Well, there goes that sponsorship.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.440
Let's try with the other ones, I guess.

27:48.720 --> 27:50.800
I just hopped on Rotten Tomatoes to see if the

27:50.800 --> 27:52.000
Alita was getting scores yet.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.160
There's a movie coming out called What Men Want.

27:54.160 --> 27:55.680
With Taraji P. Henson.

27:55.680 --> 27:57.360
Yeah, that looks cool.

27:57.360 --> 27:59.360
I wonder how many of these great questions it's going

27:59.360 --> 28:00.240
to have in it.

28:00.240 --> 28:01.840
How many of these great icebreakers.

28:02.720 --> 28:03.600
Probably a lot.

28:04.400 --> 28:06.400
If you could design a tree house, what would it look

28:06.400 --> 28:07.360
like, that kind of thing.

28:08.640 --> 28:10.240
You know what would be in my tree house?

28:10.240 --> 28:10.720
Go for it.

28:10.720 --> 28:11.120
What's that?

28:11.760 --> 28:13.360
A Casper mattress.

28:14.160 --> 28:14.400
Okay.

28:15.280 --> 28:17.120
And listen, I know you're saying, Travis, how would

28:17.120 --> 28:18.720
you get a mattress of a tree?

28:18.720 --> 28:21.920
It would be easy because one, I'd have a really cool

28:21.920 --> 28:22.720
pulley system.

28:22.720 --> 28:24.560
It would be very Swiss Family Robinson.

28:24.560 --> 28:27.200
But also, they come in boxes and then you cut them

28:27.200 --> 28:30.800
open and it goes, and becomes a full size mattress

28:30.800 --> 28:34.400
like the raft in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.

28:35.600 --> 28:36.800
So that's cool.

28:36.800 --> 28:37.360
Very cool.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.600
Also, they're incredibly comfortable.

28:39.600 --> 28:41.680
I notice whenever we tour or travel or whatever and

28:41.680 --> 28:44.000
I sleep on a mattress that isn't my Casper mattress,

28:44.640 --> 28:47.840
I legitimately notice a decrease in the quality of

28:47.840 --> 28:48.320
my sleep.

28:49.120 --> 28:51.200
And they have free shipping and returns in the US

28:51.200 --> 28:54.400
and Canada and no hassle returns.

28:54.400 --> 28:59.040
So you can be sure of your purchase with Casper's 100

28:59.040 --> 29:01.520
night risk free sleep on it trial.

29:02.080 --> 29:03.840
So you can sleep on it for 100 nights and then on

29:03.840 --> 29:06.080
like night 100 be like, no, you know what?

29:06.080 --> 29:06.880
Forget this.

29:06.880 --> 29:07.760
And you can send it back.

29:07.760 --> 29:08.480
No hassle.

29:08.480 --> 29:09.280
But don't do it.

29:09.280 --> 29:09.920
That's messed up.

29:09.920 --> 29:10.720
Don't do it.

29:10.720 --> 29:11.360
No, don't do it.

29:11.360 --> 29:11.920
Don't do this.

29:12.720 --> 29:15.120

one of these bad boys.

29:33.520 --> 29:39.520
Yeah, when talking about a 400% increase at least

29:39.520 --> 29:42.240

before it got to you.

29:51.200 --> 29:53.280
Hey, Federal Communications Commission.

29:53.840 --> 29:55.200
That's a Travis macro guarantee.

29:55.200 --> 29:56.000
It's not legally binding.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.360
Federal Communications Commission.

29:57.360 --> 29:58.400
You're listening to this one now.

29:58.400 --> 29:58.880
What's up?

29:59.440 --> 30:00.080
It's a goose.

30:01.600 --> 30:02.240
You know what?

30:02.880 --> 30:06.640
If the SEC fined us for you guaranteeing 400% increase

30:06.640 --> 30:10.160
in wet dreams, I would wear that fine like a badge of honor.

30:12.720 --> 30:13.440
Stitch Fix.

30:13.440 --> 30:15.120
I'm not going to lie about Stitch Fix.

30:15.120 --> 30:16.480
I'm only going to say true things.

30:16.480 --> 30:21.200
But every single article of clothing I've ever received

30:21.200 --> 30:24.160
from them has a retail price of $15,000.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.920
And I don't know how they're selling it to me for

30:27.920 --> 30:29.360
they all cost seven cents.

30:29.920 --> 30:31.040
And it seems to me.

30:31.040 --> 30:31.520
Oh, Justin.

30:31.520 --> 30:32.160
Oh, Justin.

30:32.160 --> 30:33.440
This one feels bad.

30:33.440 --> 30:34.720
No, it's not true.

30:34.720 --> 30:35.200
Hold on.

30:37.440 --> 30:40.720
If you would like to start filling out your wardrobe,

30:40.720 --> 30:43.520
but you're bad at picking out clothes, I get it.

30:43.520 --> 30:45.680
I've known a lot of people like that.

30:45.680 --> 30:46.800
People like that.

30:46.800 --> 30:54.080
But you don't have to live like a sloppy boy or girl

30:54.080 --> 30:58.960
or non-gender binary adhering individual any longer.

30:58.960 --> 31:01.440
No, you can turn to Stitch Fix.

31:02.080 --> 31:03.680
You're going to give them your measurements,

31:03.680 --> 31:06.080
can tell them a little bit about some of the environments

31:06.080 --> 31:08.240
you find yourself in your day to day,

31:08.240 --> 31:10.400
and then they're going to get you some looks.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.400
And you're going to tell them what you think about those looks.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.000
Keep only the ones that you like.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.480
And those are the only ones that you are going to be paying for.

31:16.480 --> 31:19.680
And then your stylist, your personal stylist,

31:19.680 --> 31:22.480
is going to get feedback about what you like and don't like.

31:22.480 --> 31:25.200
In that next box, it's going to be even better.

31:25.200 --> 31:27.760
And so on and so forth.

31:27.760 --> 31:29.520
The ones you don't like, by the way,

31:29.520 --> 31:31.520
you can exchange and return those.

31:31.520 --> 31:32.720
It's always free.

31:32.720 --> 31:34.720
There's no shipping fee.

31:34.720 --> 31:38.480
And there's the styling fee, the fee for your own personal stylist.

31:38.480 --> 31:39.760
It's only 20 bucks.

31:39.760 --> 31:42.720
And that gets applied towards anything you keep from your shipment.

31:42.720 --> 31:45.200
So like, no worries.

31:45.200 --> 31:48.160
Get started now at stitchfix.com slash my brother,

31:48.160 --> 31:50.800

31:51.520 --> 31:53.040

31:53.600 --> 31:58.640
That's stitchfix.com slash my brother to get started today.

31:58.640 --> 32:03.280
Stitchfix.com slash my brother.

32:03.280 --> 32:04.560
Can we just do a quick stitch check?

32:05.200 --> 32:08.080
My pants stitch, my shirt stitch.

32:08.080 --> 32:13.040
My pants are stitch and my over sweater is stitch.

32:13.040 --> 32:16.960
My jeans are stitch and my shirt says

32:16.960 --> 32:18.720
Hills is where the toys are.

32:18.720 --> 32:19.920
Didn't get it from stitch.

32:20.480 --> 32:21.680
Oh wait, can we go back?

32:21.680 --> 32:24.800
My pants are stitch and my tiny blue alien is stitch.

32:25.520 --> 32:26.240
Great, Trav.

32:26.240 --> 32:27.520
That's just good.

32:27.520 --> 32:27.920
Thank you.

32:27.920 --> 32:28.800
That's just good.

32:29.360 --> 32:29.840
Okay.

32:29.840 --> 32:31.440
I'm glad we went back to pick that up.

32:31.440 --> 32:33.360
I would have felt terrible for days.

32:33.360 --> 32:34.960
Moving on.

32:35.760 --> 32:37.680
Not all heroes wear capes.

32:37.680 --> 32:40.400
Some heroes watch war movies and then review them.

32:42.160 --> 32:44.320
Friendly Fire is a war movie podcast

32:44.320 --> 32:47.120
for people who don't necessarily like war movies,

32:47.120 --> 32:50.400
although it does not exclude people who love war movies.

32:50.400 --> 32:52.400
I'll have you know that I am wearing a cape.

32:52.400 --> 32:54.960
My cape is just made of sound deadening material

32:54.960 --> 32:56.720
from an audio recording studio.

32:58.320 --> 32:59.520
It's a really great show.

33:00.080 --> 33:01.520
John's daughter doesn't like it

33:01.520 --> 33:03.840
because we sometimes say swear words on it,

33:03.840 --> 33:06.960
but almost everybody else that has ever listened to it

33:06.960 --> 33:08.640
has enjoyed the program.

33:08.640 --> 33:10.960
Download and subscribe to Friendly Fire

33:10.960 --> 33:12.800
wherever you get your podcasts.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.960
To the victor, go the spoiler alerts.

33:18.400 --> 33:19.280
Y'all want a yahoo?

33:19.280 --> 33:19.520
No.

33:27.200 --> 33:28.880
I want a munch.

33:28.880 --> 33:29.360
Squad.

33:32.080 --> 33:33.840
I want too munch.

33:33.840 --> 33:35.040
Squad.

33:35.040 --> 33:36.880
Took it into a minor key.

33:36.880 --> 33:37.200
Yeah.

33:39.760 --> 33:41.600
The big game's coming up, folks.

33:41.600 --> 33:42.640
And I am-

33:42.640 --> 33:43.520
It was yesterday.

33:44.320 --> 33:45.440
Coming up next year.

33:46.240 --> 33:47.760
Super Bowl 34.

33:47.760 --> 33:50.560
Just 364 days away.

33:50.560 --> 33:53.200
Almost certainly we're not at 34, are we?

33:53.200 --> 33:54.000
54.

33:54.000 --> 33:58.480
Super Bowl 54 coming up real quick.

33:58.480 --> 34:01.120
I can't wait to watch it to see who's in it.

34:01.120 --> 34:03.520
Bojangles is cashing in on-

34:03.520 --> 34:06.640
We can't say super-

34:06.640 --> 34:08.400
Have you all ever known anyone

34:10.400 --> 34:13.280
so terrified to say anything

34:13.280 --> 34:14.960
as people are to say the Super Bowl?

34:14.960 --> 34:16.480
I know I'm just saying it,

34:16.480 --> 34:18.480
but what happens?

34:18.480 --> 34:19.760
It must be real bad, huh?

34:19.760 --> 34:21.840
They must be really aggressive about that

34:21.840 --> 34:23.680
because people work really hard not to say it.

34:24.320 --> 34:26.240
I think probably not us though.

34:27.280 --> 34:28.880
I think we're probably fine.

34:28.880 --> 34:30.640
I think the Super Bowl-

34:30.640 --> 34:31.840
Yeah, I said it.

34:31.840 --> 34:33.680
What about Super Bowl?

34:34.640 --> 34:35.920
Send out an email that says,

34:35.920 --> 34:37.920
hey, also the big game now.

34:37.920 --> 34:40.160
You can't say that one anymore.

34:40.160 --> 34:42.560
Now you have to call it the Sipper Bowl from now on.

34:43.280 --> 34:44.320
The football party.

34:44.320 --> 34:45.440
Call it that or nothing.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.920
So Bojangles just added-

34:47.920 --> 34:48.960
Competitive hugging.

34:49.520 --> 34:52.400
Bojangles adds an MVP to his lineup

34:52.400 --> 34:55.040
just in time for the Super Bowl.

34:55.040 --> 34:57.120
I added it, not Bojangles.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.320
Come after me, lawyers.

34:59.360 --> 35:00.960
The caption on this photo,

35:00.960 --> 35:02.720
which is the biggest pile of chicken

35:02.720 --> 35:04.080
I've ever seen in my entire life,

35:05.120 --> 35:08.240
says, Bojangles, encourage you.

35:13.760 --> 35:14.880
The name is plural.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.160
The entity is singular.

35:16.160 --> 35:19.120
And so it says, Bojangles, encourage you

35:19.120 --> 35:20.960
to call ahead to pre-order

35:20.960 --> 35:23.120
your 50 piece Chicken Supremes

35:23.120 --> 35:25.120
or Homestyle Tender Platter

35:25.120 --> 35:27.680
or Call of Duty Black Ops 5.

35:27.680 --> 35:28.800
Pre-order anything you want

35:28.800 --> 35:29.920
when you call Bojangles.

35:29.920 --> 35:31.760
We don't give a shit.

35:31.760 --> 35:34.080
All great teams update their playbook

35:34.080 --> 35:35.360
before the big game.

35:36.160 --> 35:40.560
All the teams update their playbook

35:40.560 --> 35:41.760
before the big game.

35:42.400 --> 35:45.040
That's why Bojangles is adding a new play

35:45.040 --> 35:48.240
just in time for this Sunday's showdown.

35:49.040 --> 35:52.160
A 50 piece Chicken Supremes platter

35:52.160 --> 35:54.400
available for $49.99.

35:54.960 --> 35:56.080
Do that math.

35:56.080 --> 35:56.640
It's a buck.

35:57.440 --> 35:58.400
A tender.

35:58.400 --> 35:59.360
A buck a clock.

35:59.360 --> 36:00.240
A buck a clock.

36:00.240 --> 36:01.680
This Sunday at participating.

36:01.680 --> 36:02.880
Holy fuck.

36:02.880 --> 36:03.680
A buck a clock.

36:03.680 --> 36:04.800
A buck a clock.

36:04.800 --> 36:06.480
It's this Sunday at participating Bojangles.

36:06.480 --> 36:07.280
Check your luck.

36:08.320 --> 36:08.800
Fuck a buck.

36:08.800 --> 36:09.520
A buck a clock.

36:11.040 --> 36:12.960
Packed with your choice of our popular

36:12.960 --> 36:15.120
perfectly seasoned Chicken Supreme

36:15.120 --> 36:18.480
or our mild flavorful Homestyle Tenders.

36:18.480 --> 36:19.680
Hey, y'all, I don't know if you got

36:19.680 --> 36:20.720
Bojangles around you.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.480
One of those is spicy and fuck me

36:22.480 --> 36:24.400
if I can ever remember which one it is.

36:25.440 --> 36:27.280
There's a 50 piece platter.

36:27.280 --> 36:29.760
It also comes with 12 delectable sauces.

36:30.640 --> 36:31.520
Get your dip on.

36:32.400 --> 36:33.200
Woof.

36:33.200 --> 36:34.160
Oh, man.

36:34.160 --> 36:36.560
Get your dip on with our classic ranch

36:36.560 --> 36:38.000
tangy barbecue.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.800
Zesty Bo's special sauce gross.

36:40.800 --> 36:43.840
And of course, that irresistible Bojangles

36:43.840 --> 36:44.640
honey mustard.

36:45.360 --> 36:46.240
Any good coach.

36:47.040 --> 36:49.760
Bojangles is making a lot of assumptions

36:49.760 --> 36:51.600
about its knowledge of sports.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.120
Any good coach knows it's important

36:53.120 --> 36:54.560
to get your play in early

36:55.120 --> 36:56.400
and you can do the same.

36:56.400 --> 36:57.440
What?

36:57.440 --> 36:58.240
Hey, you heard me.

36:58.240 --> 36:58.720
Start.

36:58.720 --> 36:59.200
Go.

36:59.200 --> 37:00.640
Go, go, go.

37:00.640 --> 37:02.160
All right, guys, first down.

37:02.160 --> 37:03.280
Let's go for that field goal.

37:04.560 --> 37:06.000
First down, better punt it.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.680
Get that play in early, though.

37:07.680 --> 37:08.400
Don't twist it.

37:08.400 --> 37:09.280
Never expect it.

37:09.280 --> 37:11.040
You can call your local Bojangles today

37:11.040 --> 37:12.880
to pre-order your platter for Sunday.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.160
You may be mad at me for telling you this

37:16.720 --> 37:17.520
after the Super Bowl,

37:17.520 --> 37:18.800
but I'm doing it for your own good.

37:18.800 --> 37:19.760
I always assume with these,

37:19.760 --> 37:21.360
there's some small percentage of the audience

37:21.360 --> 37:21.920
that will say,

37:21.920 --> 37:23.680
hmm, buck a clock, huh?

37:23.680 --> 37:24.640
Don't mind if I do.

37:24.640 --> 37:25.680
So I've just saved you from that.

37:25.680 --> 37:26.640
You're welcome.

37:26.640 --> 37:28.000
Patrick say,

37:28.000 --> 37:30.320
quote, a Bojangles 50 piece platter

37:30.320 --> 37:32.480
will always win your game day gatherings.

37:33.360 --> 37:35.360
Most valuable platter award

37:36.240 --> 37:38.720
says Randy Poindexter,

37:39.280 --> 37:41.200
senior vice president of marketing

37:41.200 --> 37:41.760
for Bojangles.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.200
No, no.

37:43.200 --> 37:45.200
Hey, whatever, all the platters

37:45.200 --> 37:47.920
and Bojangles,

37:47.920 --> 37:49.200
you win most valuable platter.

37:49.200 --> 37:51.360
But wait, I bake brownies myself.

37:51.360 --> 37:52.080
That doesn't matter.

37:52.800 --> 37:53.280
Bojangles.

37:53.280 --> 37:54.800
I spent 50 bucks on this,

37:54.800 --> 37:56.080
a buck a clock.

37:56.080 --> 37:57.120
It's most valuable.

37:57.120 --> 37:59.040
This is a $50 retail price.

37:59.040 --> 38:00.400
I can take this out on the street

38:00.400 --> 38:02.480
and wholesale it for $75.

38:02.480 --> 38:03.760
Easy, no problem.

38:03.760 --> 38:05.520
Our Supremes and Homestyle Tenders

38:05.520 --> 38:06.320
are so delicious,

38:06.880 --> 38:09.200
you might even need to bring along

38:09.200 --> 38:10.800
a second platter for your group

38:11.360 --> 38:12.640
of monsters.

38:13.360 --> 38:15.040
It doesn't say of monsters,

38:15.040 --> 38:16.560
but hey, I don't care

38:16.560 --> 38:17.760
how many people are gathered

38:17.760 --> 38:18.640
in the Lord's name.

38:18.640 --> 38:20.160
And by the Lord, I mean the Super Bowl.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.680
They shouldn't eat more than 50 chickens

38:23.680 --> 38:25.440
and- Yeah.

38:25.440 --> 38:27.040
This is my best friend.

38:27.040 --> 38:27.680
I hope you don't mind

38:27.680 --> 38:28.720
I brought him to the game.

38:28.720 --> 38:30.160
He's a kiddie pool full

38:30.160 --> 38:31.600
of hydrochloric acid.

38:34.320 --> 38:36.160
I brought this chipper shredder.

38:36.160 --> 38:36.660
I don't know.

38:37.760 --> 38:38.720
So if you don't mind,

38:38.720 --> 38:40.160
I'm just going to karate kick

38:40.160 --> 38:41.440
the leg of this table off

38:41.440 --> 38:42.480
and then just let everything

38:42.480 --> 38:43.360
slurp down into it.

38:43.360 --> 38:44.320
This is my uncle.

38:44.320 --> 38:44.960
He's a hole.

38:47.680 --> 38:48.560
So just to check,

38:48.560 --> 38:50.160
you didn't buy two of these platters,

38:50.160 --> 38:50.400
right?

38:50.400 --> 38:52.000
Because hole uncle wants to-

38:52.000 --> 38:52.800
Yeah, okay.

38:52.800 --> 38:53.920
He's got to grub down too.

38:58.720 --> 39:00.000
Get creative with your chicken

39:00.000 --> 39:01.680
Supremes or homestyle tenders.

39:01.680 --> 39:03.920
Check out Bojangles tailgate hacks

39:03.920 --> 39:05.200
to learn how you can use

39:05.200 --> 39:06.960
Bojangles menu items

39:06.960 --> 39:08.320
as a base for creating

39:08.320 --> 39:11.120
your own craveable game day recipes.

39:11.120 --> 39:12.800
So here is what Bojangles

39:12.800 --> 39:14.000
is presumed to tell you.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.400
You can take the things

39:16.400 --> 39:18.480
that we made and make them

39:20.000 --> 39:21.920
good for game day time.

39:21.920 --> 39:23.680
Wait, what are they suggesting?

39:24.560 --> 39:26.640
They're suggesting tailgate hacks, Griffin.

39:26.640 --> 39:28.320
Justin, that doesn't mean anything to me.

39:29.120 --> 39:31.600
That sounds like some sort of

39:31.600 --> 39:33.680
cybermancer is trying to gain access

39:33.680 --> 39:36.000
to my station wagon through the rear.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.080
So here's the thing that's troubling.

39:39.280 --> 39:40.880
The press release says

39:40.880 --> 39:42.080
that you can check out

39:42.080 --> 39:43.840
the Bojangles tailgate hacks,

39:44.480 --> 39:46.720
but that information is not available

39:46.720 --> 39:50.000
anywhere on the internet.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.880
I am currently very challenged

39:52.880 --> 39:58.640
by this Bojangles tailgate hack thing

39:58.640 --> 40:00.880
because they do say that it is...

40:01.600 --> 40:02.560
Okay, okay.

40:02.560 --> 40:03.520
Okay, there's a Facebook page.

40:03.520 --> 40:04.320
Did you find the Facebook page?

40:04.320 --> 40:05.600
Yeah, I found the Facebook page.

40:05.600 --> 40:10.160
I got some YouTube's here

40:10.160 --> 40:11.120
from the Bo channel.

40:13.680 --> 40:14.480
Let's see.

40:14.480 --> 40:15.680
Or some guacamole.

40:16.800 --> 40:18.080
I'm going to tell you this one.

40:18.080 --> 40:20.000
It's buffalo chicken crescent ring.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.080
Okay, so the person's made a huge

40:22.800 --> 40:27.200
sort of sunburst out of croissant wedges.

40:27.200 --> 40:29.680
Okay, it's like a flower shape.

40:29.680 --> 40:31.920
And then they take a bunch of chicken

40:31.920 --> 40:33.280
off of three chicken breasts.

40:33.280 --> 40:35.200
Okay, then they dump in a bunch

40:35.200 --> 40:36.960
of hot sauce into them.

40:36.960 --> 40:38.000
I bet they're going to stir them.

40:38.000 --> 40:38.720
Yep, yep.

40:38.720 --> 40:39.760
They're stirring it, folks.

40:39.760 --> 40:40.720
They're stirring it up.

40:42.400 --> 40:43.760
An entire brick of cream cheese.

40:44.400 --> 40:45.920
One container of Bojangles ranch.

40:45.920 --> 40:47.200
No, sorry.

40:47.200 --> 40:49.760
Two containers of Bojangles ranch sauce.

40:49.760 --> 40:51.040
They combined those and...

40:51.040 --> 40:52.000
No, don't mix them together.

40:52.640 --> 40:54.720
No, they're mixing them together.

40:56.320 --> 40:57.360
Oh, Christ.

40:57.360 --> 40:58.960
Now they've made a ring of it

40:58.960 --> 41:00.880
and it's inside the croissant.

41:00.880 --> 41:03.280
And now they've topped it with cheese.

41:03.280 --> 41:04.000
How could you?

41:04.640 --> 41:06.080
And now they're folding up the edges

41:06.080 --> 41:06.560
to make a big...

41:06.560 --> 41:07.280
Wait, slow down.

41:07.280 --> 41:08.160
I'm writing this down.

41:08.160 --> 41:10.880
A big stinky ring of chicken

41:10.880 --> 41:12.880
and they've got more ranch for dipping

41:13.520 --> 41:15.120
because fuck you.

41:15.120 --> 41:22.080
This video came out November 17th, 2018

41:22.080 --> 41:25.440
on the Bojangles official channel

41:26.480 --> 41:29.520
and I am the 88th person to ever see it.

41:29.520 --> 41:30.720
Oh, no.

41:30.720 --> 41:32.640
How is this possible?

41:32.640 --> 41:33.840
Oh, no.

41:33.840 --> 41:34.960
How is it possible

41:34.960 --> 41:38.240
that there are only 88 views of this video?

41:38.240 --> 41:40.480
More than 88 people made it.

41:40.480 --> 41:41.600
I'm looking at a different one

41:41.600 --> 41:43.920
where they've made a sort of bruschetta

41:43.920 --> 41:46.480
out of Bojangles potato rounds.

41:47.760 --> 41:48.880
And this one's got...

41:48.880 --> 41:51.280
It came out same date, 78 views on this one.

41:51.280 --> 41:53.360
Hashtag Saturday, hashtag food hack.

41:53.360 --> 41:54.720
These are so good.

41:54.720 --> 41:56.240
Hashtag football, hashtag tailgate

41:56.240 --> 41:58.960
with hashtag Bojangles, hashtag potato rounds.

41:58.960 --> 41:59.600
Yes, please.

41:59.600 --> 42:01.680
Hashtag the first empty dish at the tailgate.

42:01.680 --> 42:03.280
We are your tailgate HQ.

42:03.280 --> 42:05.040
Hashtag long live the tailgate.

42:05.040 --> 42:06.080
Go get you some.

42:07.120 --> 42:09.360
Do they really need the hashtag

42:09.360 --> 42:11.360
potato rounds there?

42:11.360 --> 42:15.200
As though if I wanted to find something about potatoes,

42:15.200 --> 42:18.000
I couldn't simply search the word potatoes

42:18.640 --> 42:21.920
and that would probably bring up everything about potatoes.

42:21.920 --> 42:24.880
Let's all silently find this Facebook video.

42:25.520 --> 42:28.240
I have not posted on Facebook since the birth of my son.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.560
I'm gonna go ahead and share this now.

42:31.760 --> 42:33.120
I've just shared it now

42:33.120 --> 42:34.800
and I will let you all know in real time

42:34.800 --> 42:36.720
how much social media attraction I get

42:36.720 --> 42:38.000
with this video on my timeline.

42:38.000 --> 42:38.880
I want...

42:38.880 --> 42:40.560
Can I push this a little further, Griffin?

42:40.560 --> 42:41.360
Yeah.

42:41.360 --> 42:42.880
I want everyone to share it.

42:42.880 --> 42:47.840
I want everyone to go to the Bojangles page

42:47.840 --> 42:48.880
and we're gonna make...

42:48.880 --> 42:50.160
Yeah, you can find it easy.

42:50.160 --> 42:52.160
Just search hashtag potato.

42:52.880 --> 42:57.120
Everybody, I've shared it on my timeline.

42:57.120 --> 43:00.720
Everybody should go find this fucking vid and share it

43:00.720 --> 43:02.800
and just start commenting on it.

43:02.800 --> 43:05.280
We'll be responding to questions throughout the week.

43:05.840 --> 43:07.200
We'll be doing an AMA.

43:07.200 --> 43:09.200
We'll be doing an AMA.

43:09.200 --> 43:11.280
We own the comments on this bitch now.

43:11.280 --> 43:12.080
These are ours.

43:14.160 --> 43:14.720
Loving this.

43:17.360 --> 43:19.520
I just commented loving this one.

43:19.520 --> 43:21.920
So that's the comments from me, Griffin.

43:21.920 --> 43:22.800
If you want to comment...

43:23.360 --> 43:24.320
Yeah, let me get on yours.

43:25.040 --> 43:27.280
You can just reply to my comment

43:27.280 --> 43:31.680
that we did on the potato post.

43:33.280 --> 43:34.000
People are gonna...

43:34.000 --> 43:35.200
I don't know.

43:35.200 --> 43:38.080
Okay, my football guys love this one.

43:38.080 --> 43:38.800
Oh, that's great.

43:39.360 --> 43:42.080
Man, this video is gonna be viral all of a sudden.

43:42.080 --> 43:44.640
And I feel pretty good that if you're the person that made it,

43:44.640 --> 43:46.480
you're gonna have a kick-ass week because of it.

43:46.480 --> 43:49.200
You're gonna think that you finally had an impact.

43:50.560 --> 43:51.440
I mean, you did.

43:51.440 --> 43:51.840
You did.

43:51.840 --> 43:52.320
You did.

43:52.320 --> 43:53.360
This ain't artificial.

43:53.360 --> 43:54.080
You did it.

43:54.080 --> 43:56.160
Okay, should I do a Yahoo?

43:56.160 --> 43:56.400
Yeah.

43:56.400 --> 43:57.600
Or is there more?

43:57.600 --> 43:58.560
I mean, I had...

43:58.560 --> 44:00.960
There's other things, but I feel like we've spent too much time

44:00.960 --> 44:02.240
on the Munch Squad already.

44:02.240 --> 44:06.160
Okay, so we'll just move on.

44:07.360 --> 44:09.360
I got one here that was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

44:09.360 --> 44:10.400
Thank you so much, Adrian.

44:10.400 --> 44:13.200
It's a Yahoo Answers user, Window, who asks,

44:14.240 --> 44:17.440
is it rude to look at other people's shopping

44:17.440 --> 44:18.480
at the supermarket?

44:19.040 --> 44:20.480
Wait, have we talked about this before?

44:21.280 --> 44:23.600
Sorry, I was distracted because I'm sharing the link

44:23.600 --> 44:26.800
to the potato thing on my Twitter,

44:26.800 --> 44:29.120
but with no comments whatsoever.

44:29.120 --> 44:29.920
It's gotta be Facebook.

44:29.920 --> 44:30.400
It's gotta be Facebook.

44:30.400 --> 44:31.040
I want it to be...

44:31.040 --> 44:31.520
It's gotta be Facebook.

44:31.520 --> 44:34.080
Well, I'm sharing the link to the Facebook page.

44:34.080 --> 44:38.000
Okay, it'll be fully five days before this episode comes out.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.160
Yeah, that's a long time to wait for content.

44:42.800 --> 44:44.160
But hey, bud, it's your Twitter.

44:45.120 --> 44:45.680
Thank you.

44:46.800 --> 44:48.560
So is it rude to look at other people's shopping

44:48.560 --> 44:49.760
in the supermarket?

44:49.760 --> 44:51.440
I love looking at other people's shopping

44:51.440 --> 44:54.080
in the supermarket, but I hate when they look at mine.

44:54.080 --> 44:57.200
But everybody's looking all day, all the time, right?

44:57.760 --> 44:58.160
Yes.

44:58.720 --> 44:58.960
Yes.

44:58.960 --> 45:01.520
Yes, when I roll past, my favorite thing to do

45:01.520 --> 45:03.920
is to try to like Sherlock a thing and be like,

45:03.920 --> 45:06.560
oh, they're gonna make, I don't know, barbecue

45:06.560 --> 45:09.040
or they have diarrhea or whatever.

45:09.040 --> 45:10.720
If you walk past and you look at their cart

45:10.720 --> 45:13.680
and you're like, oh, they're, I don't know,

45:13.680 --> 45:15.680
planning a big weekend with a college friend

45:15.680 --> 45:17.520
that they haven't seen in a decade.

45:17.520 --> 45:19.760
Yeah, the Mario Party mini game version of this

45:19.760 --> 45:25.120
is at CVS when you see me and I've got special order

45:25.120 --> 45:27.920
sort of these big boxes of Imodium.

45:27.920 --> 45:29.760
And so you see me walk up and you know sort of

45:29.760 --> 45:30.960
what my whole story is.

45:30.960 --> 45:33.280
But at the grocery store, I mostly try to just try

45:33.280 --> 45:36.160
to play a game of just like, are you being a healthy boy?

45:36.160 --> 45:37.680
Because that's really all I can get.

45:37.680 --> 45:39.520
I don't like to snoop in there a lot,

45:39.520 --> 45:42.720
but I can tell like, I can tell, I can tell.

45:42.720 --> 45:44.560
If I see a lot of stuff from the produce section,

45:44.560 --> 45:46.400
I'm like, you're just bragging now.

45:46.400 --> 45:50.160
My worry is always that when I buy something

45:50.160 --> 45:53.440
with toilet paper, the people who see it

45:53.440 --> 45:56.960
are gonna assume that whatever it is makes me poop.

45:56.960 --> 45:58.080
Yeah.

45:58.080 --> 46:02.320
Like if I buy a symphony bar and toilet paper,

46:02.320 --> 46:04.800
I was assuming they were gonna think the symphony bar.

46:04.800 --> 46:06.240
You know what's heartbreaking?

46:06.240 --> 46:07.360
We've definitely talked about this before.

46:07.360 --> 46:08.240
That's what I was gonna say.

46:08.240 --> 46:09.920
This is the, I don't wanna have another

46:09.920 --> 46:11.600
Hakuna Matata Bugs moment,

46:11.600 --> 46:13.680
but Justin is definitely talking about his fear

46:13.680 --> 46:15.840
of buying stuff with toilet paper for the fear

46:15.840 --> 46:18.240
that it would make people think that whatever he was buying

46:18.240 --> 46:19.840
would make him shit.

46:19.840 --> 46:21.760
Well, that's why I like to buy all that stuff,

46:21.760 --> 46:24.240
the sort of unspeakable stuff in one lump sum.

46:24.240 --> 46:27.280
So I'll get toilet paper and, you know, Jimmy Caps.

46:27.280 --> 46:30.480
And then you don't know what kind of fucking day I'm having.

46:31.360 --> 46:34.720
I hate the feeling of buying 18 rolls of toilet paper

46:35.760 --> 46:37.040
like when I'm at the store,

46:38.320 --> 46:41.920
but there's not a quicker emotional flip I go through

46:41.920 --> 46:44.560
than buying 18 rolls of toilet paper at the store

46:44.560 --> 46:46.080
and feeling like a bad person

46:46.080 --> 46:50.080
to seeing 18 rolls of toilet paper in my hall closet

46:50.080 --> 46:51.760
and I feel bulletproof.

46:51.760 --> 46:53.200
Nothing could touch me then.

46:53.200 --> 46:56.000
Look at all this fucking toilet paper I have.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.920
I'm good for whatever happens.

46:57.920 --> 46:59.920
I'm so loaded, I'll never have to think

46:59.920 --> 47:03.760
about toilet paper again, ever, ever, ever, never again.

47:04.480 --> 47:07.360
That explains why you keep calling your closet

47:07.360 --> 47:09.440
the panic room and it's just full

47:09.440 --> 47:10.880
top to bottom of toilet paper.

47:11.440 --> 47:14.000
So I'll tell you what I like seeing

47:14.720 --> 47:18.880
is just a lot of one thing in somebody's cart,

47:18.880 --> 47:22.080
just like chock full of Activia.

47:22.080 --> 47:24.800
And it's like, good for you.

47:25.840 --> 47:28.160
Whenever I see something like that where someone's like,

47:28.160 --> 47:31.600
they got the ingredients to say make pancakes,

47:31.600 --> 47:34.480
but times 50 where I'm like,

47:34.480 --> 47:37.280
you are doing a charity fundraiser for something

47:37.280 --> 47:38.400
and I support you.

47:38.400 --> 47:40.720
And what never crosses my mind is

47:40.720 --> 47:42.720
that person fucking loves pancakes.

47:42.720 --> 47:44.640
Loves them, has to have Activia.

47:44.640 --> 47:47.040
I noticed the thing that I think the thing I've seen the most

47:47.040 --> 47:49.200
in this situation is party pizzas.

47:49.200 --> 47:52.000
You see college kids and they've got like 50 party pizzas

47:52.000 --> 47:53.600
in there and they've got a look on their face

47:53.600 --> 47:55.440
like they're about to pull the heist of the century.

47:57.280 --> 47:59.040
Nobody can tell me how to live anymore, dad.

47:59.920 --> 48:02.720
99 cents for a whole pizza?

48:03.920 --> 48:05.840
I'm a savvy shopper now.

48:05.840 --> 48:08.640
Their dad bod hasn't fully sort of formed yet.

48:08.640 --> 48:09.360
Sure.

48:09.360 --> 48:10.800
Hasn't really gestated.

48:10.800 --> 48:13.040
There is a perfect three years where you have the money

48:13.040 --> 48:16.480
to buy party pizza and the physical ability to do so.

48:17.120 --> 48:17.620
Yes.

48:18.320 --> 48:20.080
This is why they make carts so big

48:20.080 --> 48:22.640
and so fucking see-through is so that everybody

48:22.640 --> 48:23.760
can scope out each other.

48:23.760 --> 48:27.360
Everybody can clock each other's sort of needs

48:27.360 --> 48:30.480
without being like super, super obvious about it.

48:30.480 --> 48:32.720
It's really good people watching.

48:32.720 --> 48:35.360
Let me give you a number one Travis shopping hack.

48:35.360 --> 48:37.200
This is why every time you just grab,

48:38.000 --> 48:40.320
like you're going to grab some like pickled onions.

48:40.320 --> 48:42.000
You're just going to grab something, right?

48:42.000 --> 48:43.040
Three or four of them.

48:43.040 --> 48:44.720
But you're going to hand it back to the cashier

48:44.720 --> 48:45.360
when you get up there and say,

48:45.360 --> 48:46.160
oh, I changed my mind.

48:46.160 --> 48:47.360
I don't want these pickled onions.

48:47.360 --> 48:49.440
And that's going to keep the looky loos.

48:49.440 --> 48:50.080
I see.

48:50.080 --> 48:52.560
I'm guessing about what's going on in there.

48:52.560 --> 48:54.720
Like, oh, he's pickled onions.

48:54.720 --> 48:55.440
What's he doing?

48:55.440 --> 48:57.680
Oh, those weren't my pickled onions.

48:57.680 --> 48:57.920
See, I like-

48:57.920 --> 48:59.120
I was like decoy.

48:59.120 --> 49:00.720
I like to go and get some-

49:00.720 --> 49:02.800
Also, it makes more work for the people

49:02.800 --> 49:04.320
who work at the grocery store.

49:04.320 --> 49:05.840
I bet they appreciate it.

49:05.840 --> 49:07.440
I like to swing by the butcher,

49:07.440 --> 49:09.440
get some of that good sort of parchment

49:10.000 --> 49:12.640
and line my cart with it.

49:12.640 --> 49:12.960
That's fun.

49:12.960 --> 49:14.240
Because what I do, that's for,

49:14.240 --> 49:15.760
now you can't see inside.

49:15.760 --> 49:16.720
This is my stuff.

49:17.520 --> 49:19.200
And you can also draw on it.

49:19.200 --> 49:21.200
You can draw on it, which is fun.

49:21.200 --> 49:21.520
For the kids.

49:21.520 --> 49:22.560
Well, and for me.

49:22.560 --> 49:24.400
I like to put a hole in the bottom

49:24.400 --> 49:26.400
of my shopping cart for trash

49:26.400 --> 49:28.640
and claws and bones.

49:28.640 --> 49:31.600
So as I'm eating my way through the-

49:31.600 --> 49:32.640
Oh, Justin.

49:33.840 --> 49:34.480
What's up?

49:34.480 --> 49:34.960
They don't-

49:34.960 --> 49:35.680
There's no way-

49:35.680 --> 49:38.080
Man, we've talked a lot about shoplifting

49:38.080 --> 49:40.480
or lifting, as the lifting community calls it.

49:41.440 --> 49:42.560
But we've never really talked

49:42.560 --> 49:43.920
about food lifting before.

49:44.720 --> 49:45.040
There's-

49:45.920 --> 49:47.760
I've already used it up.

49:47.760 --> 49:49.760
You can't get this out of me.

49:49.760 --> 49:51.120
That's good stuff.

49:51.120 --> 49:51.920
You can pull the watch out of-

49:51.920 --> 49:52.960
Well, they can.

49:52.960 --> 49:54.960
You can pull the watch out of my pocket,

49:54.960 --> 49:57.600
but you can't pull the Activia

49:57.600 --> 49:59.600
out of my GI tract.

49:59.600 --> 50:00.560
Cause it's already doing,

50:00.560 --> 50:02.000
it's great work in there.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.040
Hey, I'm going to give,

50:03.760 --> 50:05.760
I don't know, Kroger or Meyer

50:05.760 --> 50:07.280
or whoever's listening,

50:07.280 --> 50:09.600
a million billion dollar idea.

50:10.320 --> 50:13.280
Put little like self checkout

50:13.280 --> 50:14.320
throughout the store.

50:15.280 --> 50:16.640
So then as I'm walking, I'm like,

50:16.640 --> 50:18.640
I want to tear into these Cheez-Its right now.

50:19.200 --> 50:21.920
I can just scan it and pop the fiber in

50:21.920 --> 50:23.280
and then just start eating them.

50:23.280 --> 50:23.680
Boom.

50:23.680 --> 50:24.720
My receipt, look out.

50:25.680 --> 50:26.800
Or to just, you know,

50:26.800 --> 50:28.880
let's add back into the economy, Travis.

50:28.880 --> 50:31.360
We can have like a patience associate

50:31.360 --> 50:33.920
who goes around and if they see you sort of,

50:34.480 --> 50:36.800
you know, slavering over your own cart,

50:36.800 --> 50:38.080
they see you and like,

50:38.080 --> 50:41.120
can't wait to crack into that dry tortellini, huh?

50:41.120 --> 50:41.920
I feel you.

50:41.920 --> 50:43.600
You want me to beep that out for you?

50:43.600 --> 50:44.800
And then I can beep it out

50:44.800 --> 50:46.240
and then you can have yourself a time.

50:46.240 --> 50:47.840
And we'll have private booths

50:47.840 --> 50:49.120
for you to do this work in.

50:49.760 --> 50:51.440
Yes, oh, I like that.

50:51.440 --> 50:52.560
Oh, and you set me up

50:52.560 --> 50:54.080
with like a little camp stove

50:54.080 --> 50:55.120
and a pot of water

50:55.120 --> 50:57.040
and I can have that tortellini right now.

50:58.240 --> 51:00.000
You get me a Bic lighter and a can of Coke,

51:00.000 --> 51:01.440
I'll tortellini those up for you.

51:04.880 --> 51:10.160
My local Kroger has a program

51:10.160 --> 51:13.360
where you can have old cookies

51:14.000 --> 51:15.360
sitting out on the deli counter.

51:15.360 --> 51:18.560
There's a container of yesterday's cookies

51:18.560 --> 51:20.960
that is free, you know, for the kids.

51:21.920 --> 51:26.000
And I talked to this outreach program

51:26.000 --> 51:29.600
up to my four-year-old daughter, Charlie, a lot.

51:29.600 --> 51:31.760
And because it was the first time

51:31.760 --> 51:34.080
we had a Kona Kroger, I think.

51:34.080 --> 51:35.520
And I said, they got this thing,

51:35.520 --> 51:37.040
they used to have this thing as a kid

51:37.040 --> 51:38.480
where they would have like free cookies.

51:39.040 --> 51:43.360
So I rolled back to the counter of the deli

51:43.360 --> 51:46.560
and there's no container of cookies.

51:47.600 --> 51:52.480
And everyone working at the counter

51:53.360 --> 51:56.320
is like 20 feet away from the counter.

51:56.880 --> 52:00.320
So I started standing there

52:00.320 --> 52:03.920
with like a casual kind of talking to my daughter

52:03.920 --> 52:06.480
about, huh, I guess there's no cookies, sweetheart.

52:06.480 --> 52:09.040
I thought, but I realized this wasn't loud enough

52:09.040 --> 52:10.800
to get the attention of anybody.

52:10.800 --> 52:12.800
So then I started talking louder.

52:16.800 --> 52:20.800
Well, sweetie, I guess they don't have any free cookies.

52:21.840 --> 52:24.880
I'm sorry, I guess they don't have any this time.

52:25.680 --> 52:31.680
And then the person working the counter

52:31.680 --> 52:33.520
20 feet away looks up at me,

52:34.080 --> 52:37.120
takes off their gloves and start walking up.

52:37.120 --> 52:39.280
And I'm like, oh no, oh no, oh no.

52:39.280 --> 52:41.120
Oh no, oh no, I don't want,

52:41.120 --> 52:42.880
this is too involved, oh no.

52:42.880 --> 52:44.720
And they said, what do you need?

52:44.720 --> 52:46.160
And I said, free cookies.

52:52.720 --> 52:56.400
And they looked at me completely blank,

52:56.400 --> 53:01.360
like, of course you'd like some free cookies.

53:01.360 --> 53:03.120
Sir, this is a store.

53:05.360 --> 53:08.480
Everything is purchased here.

53:08.480 --> 53:10.800
I cut, I cut pigs.

53:10.800 --> 53:12.240
What are you talking about?

53:13.520 --> 53:14.720
I'm the pig cutter.

53:16.480 --> 53:19.040
I have no jurisdiction over cookie prices.

53:20.240 --> 53:22.480
So, okay, for future reference,

53:22.480 --> 53:23.760
if you do go to Croaker,

53:23.760 --> 53:26.400
the free cookies are at the bakery counter.

53:26.400 --> 53:32.240
That's where you're going to want to go for that.

53:32.240 --> 53:37.120
You don't want to go to the place where they cut the meat.

53:37.120 --> 53:39.360
And ask for free cookies

53:39.360 --> 53:42.400
because you will be an embarrassment to your child.

53:43.600 --> 53:44.640
And your brothers.

53:46.240 --> 53:49.600
And the audience of people, I'm assuming, at this point.

53:49.600 --> 53:52.400
So I guess this is my roundabout way of saying

53:52.400 --> 53:56.000
I'm super sorry to Croaker and everybody.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.600
And I'm just really sorry.

53:58.240 --> 54:00.080
I've just realized that, oh no,

54:00.080 --> 54:02.640
this has become too involved could also be

54:02.640 --> 54:05.600
like the McElroy motto on our crest of arms.

54:05.600 --> 54:08.480
Folks, thanks for hanging out with us.

54:08.480 --> 54:10.320
We sure appreciated our time with you.

54:10.320 --> 54:11.680
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

54:12.880 --> 54:16.720
We are, yes, we have one last chance to you

54:17.280 --> 54:22.800
to pitch our shows in Birmingham, Alabama,

54:22.800 --> 54:26.080
and New Orleans, Louisiana.

54:26.640 --> 54:29.840
These are going to be happening this week

54:29.840 --> 54:31.600
as you listen to this.

54:31.600 --> 54:36.400
On February the 7th, we're going to be in Birmingham, Alabama

54:37.120 --> 54:38.240
at the Alabama Theater.

54:38.720 --> 54:42.480
And on the 9th, we're going to be doing the Adventure Zone

54:42.480 --> 54:44.320
at the Orpheum in New Orleans.

54:44.320 --> 54:45.920
The 10th, we're going to be doing

54:45.920 --> 54:48.800
My Brother, My Brother and Me in New Orleans.

54:48.800 --> 54:50.720
Both of those My Brother, My Brother and Me shows

54:50.720 --> 54:54.160
will have Sawbones and Schmanners opening up for them.

54:54.960 --> 54:56.080
So it's a huge value.

54:57.120 --> 54:59.200
Come see them, come see us.

54:59.200 --> 55:02.080
Also, go ahead and start sending in your questions

55:02.080 --> 55:03.440
for those of you haven't already.

55:03.440 --> 55:06.800
Make sure to put New Orleans or Birmingham

55:06.800 --> 55:08.000
in the subject line.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.840
And I'm just going to go ahead and tell you

55:09.840 --> 55:11.680
to send in those yahoos too.

55:11.680 --> 55:12.480
Am I right, Griffin?

55:12.480 --> 55:14.160
Yes, please, please, please.

55:14.160 --> 55:16.960
If you go to McElroy.family and click tours,

55:16.960 --> 55:19.200
you can get tickets for those shows.

55:19.200 --> 55:20.560
I think they're going to be very fun

55:21.120 --> 55:23.280
and we would love to see you there.

55:23.280 --> 55:24.320
So please come out for those.

55:25.120 --> 55:28.480
While you're at it, just poke around McElroy.family

55:28.480 --> 55:30.400
and also find links to our merch

55:30.400 --> 55:32.880
and to our other projects, including video stuff

55:32.880 --> 55:34.880
like episodes of Monster Factory.

55:34.880 --> 55:38.160
There should be a new one up by the time you hear this.

55:38.160 --> 55:40.160
So go check that out.

55:40.160 --> 55:41.920
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

55:41.920 --> 55:42.800
for the use of our theme song.

55:42.800 --> 55:44.000
It's a departure off the album,

55:44.000 --> 55:47.200
Putting the Days to Bed, which is a bop.

55:47.200 --> 55:48.880
And also thank you to Maximum Fun

55:48.880 --> 55:50.000

55:54.640 --> 55:56.720
Very exciting, all at MaximumFun.org.

55:56.720 --> 55:57.920
And do y'all want that final?

55:57.920 --> 55:58.560
You know I do.

55:58.560 --> 55:58.960
Yes.

55:59.520 --> 56:01.840
This final Yahoo was sent in by Sid Ross.

56:01.840 --> 56:02.800
Thank you, Sid.

56:02.800 --> 56:04.560
It is an anonymous Yahoo answers user

56:04.560 --> 56:06.880
who I'm going to call Preston.

56:06.880 --> 56:07.360
Asks...

56:12.240 --> 56:14.560
Can 38 year olds listen to Slipknot?

56:16.960 --> 56:18.720
My name is Justin McElroy.

56:18.720 --> 56:20.240
I'm Travis McElroy.
