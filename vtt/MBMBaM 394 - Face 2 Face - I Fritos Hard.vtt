WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:49.920
Uh, hello, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:49.920 --> 01:02.080
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

01:08.560 --> 01:12.480
And I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

01:12.480 --> 01:27.840
You know, folks, here we are. It's the end of a tour. The end of our four-day tour.

01:30.000 --> 01:37.920
And we are not as young as we once were. Time works. Yeah, and this tour has been

01:37.920 --> 01:43.920
plagued with completely unavoidable injuries. Was anybody at the Minneapolis show last night?

01:45.200 --> 01:51.360
I don't tell what happened, but I suffered a very brave injury.

01:52.800 --> 01:56.240
On top of Griffin's unavoidable injury. Brave, heroic.

01:57.120 --> 02:04.960
Griffin fell backwards in his chair. It's really the only injury you can sustain in our format.

02:04.960 --> 02:10.320
We don't have a lot of pyrotechnics. It made the local newspaper headlines that said,

02:10.320 --> 02:18.480
hero boy has good fall. Yeah, hero boy saved show with brat fall. I had the unavoidable injury of

02:19.360 --> 02:23.120
one of the hosts of Hello from the Magic Tavern, Adol Raffaei.

02:24.720 --> 02:28.960
You know how sometimes you unavoidably arm wrestle someone seven times?

02:28.960 --> 02:34.560
Because you unavoidably drink. Because you unavoidably drank bourbon.

02:36.640 --> 02:40.880
And then you wake up and you're old and your shoulders and your arms hurt.

02:40.880 --> 02:45.760
And then the next day, different parts of your body hurt. That's what old age is,

02:45.760 --> 02:54.720
by the way, young people. I have sustained a 48-hour spectrum of injuries from arm wrestling,

02:54.720 --> 03:00.880
some of which took 36 hours to develop. And I have a fever right now.

03:05.440 --> 03:14.560
I had a fever so bad last night that I started trying to figure out who would be Justin tonight.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.720
That's how bad this fever was. And I know, listen,

03:16.720 --> 03:20.160
you're all listening to this right now and you're like, money back, please.

03:20.160 --> 03:28.240
And I get that. But no, no, there's no refunds. We need that body for like,

03:28.240 --> 03:32.240
we need that money for operations, apparently to our old, old bodies.

03:32.240 --> 03:40.080
Here's the thing. We woke up this morning real early and then we got on a train.

03:41.760 --> 03:46.080
Not just any train, the Empire Builder. The Empire Builder.

03:46.080 --> 03:50.880
It's a line that goes from Chicago to Seattle. We took it just on the brief leg,

03:50.880 --> 03:56.960
the two brief leg from Minneapolis to Milwaukee, which was only six hours.

03:56.960 --> 04:01.920
And I don't think there's anything that six hours were at the end of it.

04:01.920 --> 04:07.760
I think, oh man, I can't believe it's over. But that's the way I felt after this train today.

04:07.760 --> 04:10.240
I couldn't believe that I had to get off the train.

04:10.240 --> 04:11.280
It healed my back.

04:11.280 --> 04:11.600
Yeah.

04:11.600 --> 04:17.200
Yeah. It made me not have drunkenly arm wrestled Adil Rafai. It was amazing.

04:17.760 --> 04:19.280
Justin still does have a fever.

04:20.560 --> 04:29.760
Uh oh, but I'm feeling good now. I was feeling a little rough 45 seconds ago back there.

04:29.760 --> 04:33.920
But then I came out and I got some me, I opened up a tall,

04:34.480 --> 04:38.640
cool glass of Milwaukee energy and now you've fed it into me.

04:38.640 --> 04:41.840
And I so appreciate that.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.760
And just so you know, and I don't,

04:43.760 --> 04:48.880
I don't like to throw my power behind things lightly, but ride more trains.

04:50.240 --> 04:50.720
Yeah.

04:50.720 --> 04:55.120
They're great. I want them to have a resurgence that I can take a train like to the grocery store.

04:55.840 --> 05:01.200
Even their announcements are like a hundred times better than airplane announcements.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.800
Can you have the, can we,

05:02.800 --> 05:05.200
Hold on. I'll see if it'll work.

05:05.200 --> 05:08.560
I don't know if we got permission from, there was a gentleman named Will.

05:08.560 --> 05:13.040
Who kept doing announcements that were the best shit I'd ever heard in my entire life.

05:13.040 --> 05:14.240
And I looked forward to them.

05:14.240 --> 05:19.280
Cause he wasn't doing the usual like Southwest airlines, Austin powers impression.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.560
All right, let's see if we can see me hear this.

05:22.560 --> 05:23.520
Okay. I'll do my best.

05:25.040 --> 05:27.360
Ice cold beer.

05:28.320 --> 05:30.800
It is now being served in the cafe bar.

05:30.800 --> 05:35.840
So come on down, grab that sweet treat, that tasty snack, that cool beverage.

05:35.840 --> 05:40.400
And don't forget that delicious cup of coffee always.

05:57.360 --> 05:59.920
As well, I had, and you know what?

05:59.920 --> 06:02.880
I didn't need those things, but you know, I had to get down there to see that guy

06:03.520 --> 06:05.600
and he was as delightful as you would hope he would be.

06:05.600 --> 06:06.560
It was amazing.

06:06.560 --> 06:07.120
Thank you, Will.

06:07.120 --> 06:08.080
Thank you, trains.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.200
Thank you, choo choo train.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.360
Should we do our thing where we do the questions?

06:15.360 --> 06:18.400
So we got an advice show, as you've certainly guessed by now.

06:18.400 --> 06:19.520
We're going to take an intermission.

06:20.160 --> 06:25.600
So, I mean, not right now, but we will be taking intermission, intermission.

06:25.600 --> 06:28.880
Like we're going to be taking several intermissions throughout the night.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.680
Justin will be asleep during the whole intermission.

06:31.680 --> 06:32.320
Just straight up.

06:32.320 --> 06:37.520
But when we got an eight minute diarrhea intermission, I'll let you know.

06:37.520 --> 06:40.000
But when we come back, when we come back from intermission,

06:40.000 --> 06:41.440
we're going to do audience questions.

06:42.480 --> 06:46.160
So we want you to be thinking about those now, prepping and stealing yourself

06:47.040 --> 06:50.080
for when you stand up and there's lights up and you're like,

06:50.080 --> 06:52.400
oh shit, there's a lot of people here.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.680
And you have to talk in front of them.

06:53.680 --> 06:54.240
Please.

06:54.240 --> 06:58.080
I have a coworker who immediately after crossing the doorway of the bathroom

06:58.080 --> 07:00.160
starts unbuckling and unzipping his pants.

07:00.160 --> 07:05.360
And as he walks to the urinal, he doesn't seem to have a medical condition

07:05.360 --> 07:07.360
or even have to go with any urgency.

07:07.360 --> 07:12.160
My question to you brothers is how close to the toilet do you need to be

07:12.160 --> 07:13.520
in order to start getting ready?

07:15.600 --> 07:16.640
It's a good who's that?

07:16.640 --> 07:17.200
Who's that by?

07:18.080 --> 07:18.720
No name.

07:18.720 --> 07:19.440
Are you here?

07:21.040 --> 07:22.240
Holy shit.

07:23.760 --> 07:25.360
Are you nine feet tall?

07:25.360 --> 07:30.000
Oh, I don't know if that came from the balcony or if they're nine feet tall.

07:31.520 --> 07:33.600
It's a good question because if you think about it,

07:34.800 --> 07:38.240
the if you're not close enough and Nina was the name,

07:38.240 --> 07:40.080
I don't know why I didn't close enough in Nina.

07:40.080 --> 07:46.080
OK, so the weird thing is, if you think about it, you if you start that

07:46.080 --> 07:50.000
literally the second before you cross the threshold of the bathroom,

07:50.000 --> 07:50.720
it's a crime.

07:51.600 --> 07:54.320
And then you get across through the threshold

07:54.320 --> 07:55.760
and it's not a crime anymore.

07:55.760 --> 07:57.120
So what do we do?

07:57.120 --> 07:58.640
What do we even do in here?

07:58.640 --> 08:01.200
So I feel like from a legality perspective,

08:01.200 --> 08:02.960
you're fine once you cross the threshold.

08:02.960 --> 08:03.600
Holy shit.

08:03.600 --> 08:08.160
I've never thought about it before, but there I can't think of any other

08:08.160 --> 08:12.720
one, maybe a bedroom, a room that's like it's OK if you do it in here.

08:12.720 --> 08:13.680
It's not a crime.

08:13.680 --> 08:14.880
Nude zone.

08:14.880 --> 08:17.920
Yeah, like just that idea of like we have designated

08:17.920 --> 08:21.120
that there's something in this paint that protects your nudity.

08:21.120 --> 08:21.920
It's lead.

08:21.920 --> 08:25.760
So so Jesus can't see you and Superman.

08:25.760 --> 08:28.400
Jesus and Superman can't see what happens in the bathroom.

08:29.680 --> 08:32.000
I would be I wouldn't I wouldn't do this,

08:32.000 --> 08:34.480
not from a question of decency, but just of like.

08:35.680 --> 08:37.440
Like my pants falling down.

08:37.440 --> 08:39.120
I mean, that's funny once.

08:39.120 --> 08:43.360
Yeah, or not if you get in the bathroom and you're just like,

08:43.360 --> 08:46.240
well, like it's kind of you walk to the urinal with your pants around

08:46.240 --> 08:47.920
your ankles like you're a toddler.

08:47.920 --> 08:48.640
That's what I'm saying.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.160
It's maybe funny once.

08:50.160 --> 08:53.840
Once if you're if you're that person and what they mentioned,

08:53.840 --> 08:55.440
I don't think they have a medical condition.

08:55.440 --> 08:57.600
What medical condition would necessitate?

08:59.040 --> 09:03.840
I need constant breeze on my zone.

09:03.840 --> 09:10.160
You know, the problem here is that we have lost something in the world

09:10.160 --> 09:12.640
and specifically in this human decency.

09:14.000 --> 09:14.880
No, but yes.

09:16.400 --> 09:19.680
Bathroom attendance because it was their job.

09:19.680 --> 09:20.800
What are they going to do?

09:20.800 --> 09:21.440
It was their job.

09:22.880 --> 09:26.800
No, you're suggesting it was a bathroom attendance job to let you know

09:27.840 --> 09:28.640
and begin.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.440
Consummate your toilet.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.440
Yes, right this way, sir.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.480
No, not yet.

09:38.480 --> 09:39.280
I saw it.

09:41.600 --> 09:42.160
Go right ahead.

09:43.840 --> 09:47.200
When we dad and I flew in together and we

09:47.200 --> 09:49.680
we and boy are his arms tired.

09:53.520 --> 09:58.080
No, no, even I'm going to say no to that one.

09:58.080 --> 10:02.880
No, we flew in through Atlanta and boy are his arms.

10:11.280 --> 10:15.600
So our our airplane landed in Atlanta before leaving for another.

10:15.600 --> 10:20.720
Third damn it stop and they had a bathroom attendant in there

10:20.720 --> 10:22.160
and we were waiting in line.

10:22.160 --> 10:24.640
You're going to I wish I had like a diagram,

10:24.640 --> 10:29.120
but we were waiting in line for the toilet stalls

10:29.120 --> 10:31.360
and there was a lot of urinals in front of us

10:31.360 --> 10:33.680
and then there was a line of urinals to the right

10:33.680 --> 10:35.200
that would have been out of sight for us

10:35.760 --> 10:39.040
and there was a bathroom attendant standing right in front of dad and I

10:39.040 --> 10:43.840
and he was going urinals and then pointed at the ones that were open to our right.

10:43.840 --> 10:50.560
And then again urinals right here and then he said urinals right over here, fellas.

10:51.440 --> 10:53.360
There's several urinals open right here.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.960
Fellas urinals right here like five times

10:56.960 --> 10:59.760
and eventually I have to look at this man dead in the eye and say, I'm going to poop.

11:02.240 --> 11:05.360
Like I know. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

11:05.360 --> 11:09.040
Thank you. I'm going to you should have just walked over and pooped in the urinal.

11:09.040 --> 11:13.040
You're the boss. When in Atlanta. You're the expert, I guess.

11:13.840 --> 11:17.520
Yeah, it's your bathroom man. If you if you want to attend to that,

11:17.520 --> 11:19.040
I guess that's your prerogative.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.080
How about a Yahoo.

11:25.680 --> 11:28.080
This Yahoo was actually sent in by a lot of people.

11:28.080 --> 11:32.400
Thank you everybody who sent this one and it's by Yahoo Answers user Amber who asks,

11:32.400 --> 11:38.400
What did Christian Grey say in the clean TV version of the movie Fifty Shades of Grey?

11:40.400 --> 11:45.200
He said, I don't make love. I blank hard.

11:46.160 --> 11:50.560
What word did he say there in the clean version of the movie suitable for TV?

11:54.000 --> 11:59.520
I cannot but I cannot believe TBS would put in the elbow grip

11:59.520 --> 12:08.240
required to get this cut going. Yeah, I get hard. I am. I am hard.

12:08.240 --> 12:13.600
No. See, I don't think that would work either. I don't have. What is it? I don't make love.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.160
I don't make love. I don't make love. I hump.

12:17.680 --> 12:21.920
I don't make love. I hump. You don't understand what censorship is.

12:21.920 --> 12:27.040
I feel like I don't make love. I love hard. I think you can. I don't know.

12:27.040 --> 12:31.600
I love hard. I think you can. I think you can allude to having.

12:31.600 --> 12:34.480
I think it's just like the F word that they're having a problem with.

12:34.480 --> 12:36.400
Did I just? I think it's fuck.

12:38.640 --> 12:42.320
Sorry, we're all grown ups here. Unlike TBS. It's going to be a ribald show.

12:42.320 --> 12:47.280
Yeah. Um, I, I don't make love. I.

12:47.280 --> 12:56.640
I. They edit it in a hand. That digital hand appears.

12:56.640 --> 12:58.800
I don't make love. I, you know.

13:02.640 --> 13:06.160
They use that digital hand so much during the movie.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.760
So many times. It covers.

13:07.760 --> 13:12.480
This is my secret room and here we're going to shh and do shh.

13:12.480 --> 13:17.920
During the sex scenes, they edited in like eight of them just all angled at different.

13:21.360 --> 13:25.200
That would be so good. Nobody wants to look at the black sensor bars anymore.

13:25.200 --> 13:28.000
They just want to see like a guy up there just like,

13:31.360 --> 13:36.720
and he's like watching as he keeps up with it. Like, Oh God, why are they moving so much?

13:36.720 --> 13:41.680
I think they should just have digital parents fingers come in in front of the screen.

13:41.680 --> 13:44.880
Just like four fingers cover what you say.

13:44.880 --> 13:49.120
But digital guy who's blocking the whole screen would be great.

13:49.120 --> 13:57.200
Cause he's watching and he's like, whoa, no way.

13:57.200 --> 14:00.640
Oh, your parents would be watching too. They wanted to watch an erotic film.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.560
They're not going to miss out on some of the erotic scenes.

14:02.560 --> 14:05.920
Yeah. It's there for that. No parent has put on an erotic film and be like,

14:05.920 --> 14:10.880
Oh no, I keep saying erotic film. No parents put on an erotic film period.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.320
You're all welcome to sleep well.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.800
What if they just leaned into the censorship and it was like,

14:16.800 --> 14:18.960
I don't make love. I study hard.

14:21.200 --> 14:24.240
And you should do here's a pencil and a candle.

14:24.240 --> 14:27.920
I pray hard. So extra hard and loud.

14:27.920 --> 14:31.440
Sign my pray contract. This is 50 shades of pray.

14:33.760 --> 14:36.480
Now they're missing a money-making opportunity.

14:36.480 --> 14:43.120
I don't make love. I Fritos. What Christian?

14:43.120 --> 14:47.680
You got my Fritos jeans. Put your Fritos on the floor.

14:48.240 --> 14:52.240
I'm going to spray Doritos all over your Pringles.

14:55.840 --> 14:59.600
Are you ready to get flavor blasted? Are you ready to get flavor blasted?

14:59.600 --> 15:08.800
And then you just feel like a bag of Doritos covering the sex scenes.

15:18.480 --> 15:23.280
And a lot of movies with sex scenes that go on TBS or USA characters.

15:23.280 --> 15:27.120
Welcome. What they do is they just zoom and like

15:27.120 --> 15:33.040
tight crop on the non-sexual parts of the sex that's happening.

15:33.040 --> 15:39.920
And I feel like for this movie, it would, it's just like a tiny frame.

15:39.920 --> 15:45.360
Or just like a slow band like a photo frame background, just like his dog.

15:49.280 --> 15:52.400
Just crops. If you cut all the sex scenes out of 50 Shades of Grey,

15:52.400 --> 16:02.000
it's basically a short film about a very rich businessman that does not go to work.

16:02.000 --> 16:07.600
I haven't seen the second one. 50 Shades Harder. 50 Shades Harder.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.440
50 Shades Danker. Is that the one?

16:10.160 --> 16:12.400
And that one, he just goes to work the whole time.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.920
We were talking about a question we were thinking about doing that we decided not to do.

16:17.920 --> 16:22.800
But during the discussion of that, Travis introduced the phrase into the world,

16:22.800 --> 16:26.320
50 Shades of Grey SMR, and we're not going to do anything with that.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.720
It's just that I wanted to. Yeah, thank you very much.

16:28.720 --> 16:34.000
Yeah, I'm so I was so proud of it. You know how like you hatch a baby bird

16:34.000 --> 16:35.520
and then someone's like, I'm going to kill that.

16:35.520 --> 16:39.680
You know, like, oh, I wish you would. I wish you would just stay.

16:39.680 --> 16:41.680
That's how I felt. Stay in the world.

16:42.240 --> 16:46.000
I wish you wouldn't kill my baby bird, but I get it. It's not funny.

16:46.000 --> 16:51.040
I went to Penn Station before seeing Thor Ragnarok with one of my friends.

16:51.040 --> 16:53.520
No spoilers. While at Penn Station,

16:53.520 --> 16:56.240
my friend began to make sex sounds and faces while eating a sandwich.

16:56.240 --> 17:01.280
This is a raunchy Randy affair. All the questions are sexually themed.

17:01.280 --> 17:03.280
Sorry, we should have warned you ahead of time.

17:04.080 --> 17:06.560
This is a very sexual. Because as we started to get sick

17:06.560 --> 17:13.600
and beaten up, get horny. We're severely broken people.

17:13.600 --> 17:17.200
I think I've got a fever. Yeah, you do.

17:18.720 --> 17:22.960
When asked why he was doing this, he looked at me dead in the eyes and said,

17:22.960 --> 17:27.200
it's just that good. He's a very enthusiastic person,

17:27.200 --> 17:31.280
but this behavior takes that to a new level. Can I remain friends with him?

17:31.280 --> 17:33.440
Should I just never go to Penn Station with him again?

17:33.440 --> 17:35.520
Help me, brothers. Are you here?

17:36.960 --> 17:39.040
Is your friend here? And if you are here,

17:39.040 --> 17:44.240
please just a yes noise. Just a regular yes.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.960
Would be fine? Okay.

17:48.400 --> 17:54.160
Is it possible your friend had never had a sandwich before?

17:55.600 --> 17:59.360
Because here's the thing. This is nothing against sandwich chains,

18:00.320 --> 18:04.560
but to have a sandwich is like, my God. Yeah, it's not possible.

18:04.560 --> 18:09.600
That's like legend. You can have a sandwich orgasm

18:09.600 --> 18:16.000
and still be demure about it. Just like when Harry met Sally,

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
but you eat it and you're like, and then that's it.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.680
I'm going to finish this sandwich. It's not all yelling and yelling.

18:23.680 --> 18:26.480
That seemed to be more upsetting if she was trying to cloak it.

18:26.480 --> 18:36.960
I'll actually have another table. If you could move me away from that woman,

18:37.520 --> 18:41.040
that would be great. Do you remember off the top of your head,

18:41.040 --> 18:44.800
which Penn Station offering it was, what sandwich it was your friend enjoyed?

18:45.840 --> 18:49.040
The club sandwich? It wasn't even hot.

18:49.040 --> 18:52.640
It wasn't even hot. It was a cold club sandwich.

18:52.640 --> 18:57.200
There's not even like a good or bad with that. It's just the bread and the cheese and the meat.

18:57.200 --> 19:03.040
When I lived in LA, if this is a story about a good sandwich you ate one time,

19:03.040 --> 19:05.040
I'll walk off the stage. No, no, no, no, no.

19:05.600 --> 19:11.200
It's when we lived in Culver City, there was university housing next to us.

19:11.200 --> 19:18.480
And every Sunday for six months, we could hear someone make loud sex noises.

19:18.480 --> 19:25.520
Yeah. And here's the thing, it was every Sunday from three to four.

19:28.400 --> 19:32.560
And the thing was, there was no peak or valley to it.

19:33.600 --> 19:41.520
It was three o'clock to three oh oh oh one for an hour.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.520
And I bring this up because much like that,

19:45.520 --> 19:50.240
your friend was trying to prove something about how much they were enjoying the sandwich.

19:50.240 --> 19:53.920
Like, we get it. Or how loud an orgasm they can have.

19:54.560 --> 19:58.640
Both of which are kind of meaningless accomplishments, I feel like.

19:58.640 --> 20:02.080
Did it continue throughout the day? Did he see Thor Ragnarok and like,

20:02.080 --> 20:05.680
Oh, the fights! I love when Thor does this.

20:08.480 --> 20:12.480
You get a free popcorn refill at such a great value!

20:12.480 --> 20:18.400
Extra butter!

20:18.400 --> 20:21.440
I've never sounded like that having sex ever.

20:26.240 --> 20:27.040
Uh, how about a different...

20:31.760 --> 20:34.240
What? What?

20:36.800 --> 20:37.300
What?

20:38.560 --> 20:39.760
I mean, I know what it is.

20:39.760 --> 20:43.440
This just came in. This one just came in so hot.

20:43.440 --> 20:44.960
I didn't even know I was going to do it.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.560
So I found it on my iPad.

20:46.560 --> 20:48.320
How did it get on your iPad?

20:49.280 --> 20:50.800
It was on here and I forgot about it.

20:50.800 --> 20:54.160
And then it popped up while I was looking for something else on a doll watch.

20:58.560 --> 21:03.440
This is kind of a different one because usually we have a tapestry of a narrative.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.080
And this is a much shorter kind of thing.

21:06.080 --> 21:12.320
But I just wanted to highlight a user on eBay that posted a lot of haunted dolls.

21:13.280 --> 21:17.760
They're regular Indiana Jones of haunted dolls with all of their discoveries.

21:17.760 --> 21:18.960
Her name's Punkin' Leah.

21:19.840 --> 21:20.720
One again?

21:20.720 --> 21:21.680
Punkin' Leah.

21:21.680 --> 21:24.640
And she does short stories.

21:26.560 --> 21:28.240
Wait, the user is Punkin' Leah.

21:28.240 --> 21:28.800
Punkin' Leah.

21:28.800 --> 21:30.960
The doll doesn't write short stories.

21:30.960 --> 21:31.460
No.

21:31.840 --> 21:34.560
Oh man, that would have been a good homework hack.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.160
Here we go.

21:37.120 --> 21:37.840
Here's the first one.

21:37.840 --> 21:39.440
Haunted doll possessed by demonic entity.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.320
This doll is so chilling.

21:42.320 --> 21:43.680
She screams at random times.

21:43.680 --> 21:44.800
Nights are favorable.

21:44.800 --> 21:48.400
Has been caught turning her head on her own and my pets will even not go near.

21:50.000 --> 21:50.880
End of listing.

21:51.760 --> 21:53.280
Oh, that's it?

21:53.280 --> 21:54.320
That's the listing.

21:55.360 --> 21:55.920
New doll.

21:56.960 --> 21:58.640
This doll scares the shit out of me.

22:01.440 --> 22:04.000
It always moves on its own, which is terrifying.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.080
And we've even heard laughs in the middle of the night.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.280
I thought I could handle it.

22:07.280 --> 22:08.720
This is the next level haunted.

22:08.720 --> 22:09.600
I need it gone.

22:11.120 --> 22:11.920
End of listing.

22:12.640 --> 22:14.000
Price to move.

22:14.000 --> 22:14.480
I didn't even know.

22:14.480 --> 22:15.040
Wait, how much?

22:15.040 --> 22:15.440
How much?

22:15.440 --> 22:16.080
Go back to that one.

22:16.080 --> 22:16.580
How much?

22:17.360 --> 22:17.760
$18.

22:19.760 --> 22:20.800
I need it gone.

22:20.800 --> 22:22.960
I didn't even know you could cuss on eBay.

22:24.240 --> 22:24.800
New doll.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.280
Don't let the sweet face fool you.

22:27.280 --> 22:29.200
I've had many haunted items throughout the years,

22:29.200 --> 22:31.840
but never one that completely moved in front of me

22:31.840 --> 22:35.280
and bald daylight literally scared the shit out of me.

22:35.280 --> 22:35.920
End of listing.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.560
This sweet petite little thing is evil to the core.

22:43.600 --> 22:46.560
I've woke up now numerous times with her in my bed.

22:46.560 --> 22:50.560
I have removed it from my house in hopes of preventing this from happening again.

22:50.560 --> 22:51.760
I want her gone.

22:51.760 --> 22:54.080
Any offer is considered.

22:54.080 --> 22:54.560
$25.

22:57.280 --> 22:58.960
Don't let the cute face fool you.

22:58.960 --> 23:00.720
This possessed doll is terrifying.

23:00.720 --> 23:02.080
She likes to disappear.

23:02.080 --> 23:03.600
She don't like to stay where you put her.

23:03.600 --> 23:05.120
And she even giggles at night.

23:05.120 --> 23:07.120
I'm ready for her to disappear forever.

23:08.960 --> 23:10.400
She scares the hell out of me.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.280
Please beware.

23:11.840 --> 23:12.640
End of listing.

23:12.640 --> 23:15.920
I do like that there's a sliding scale of this one scares the shit out of me.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.160
This one just scares the hell out of me.

23:18.160 --> 23:19.360
It's not as bad.

23:19.360 --> 23:23.600
These are all from the same person and they were all posted within an hour of each other.

23:23.600 --> 23:25.520
Hey, hey, Leah.

23:25.520 --> 23:26.960
How are things at your house?

23:26.960 --> 23:30.080
It seems like you've got kind of a wild house right now.

23:30.080 --> 23:33.440
Hey, Leah, why not one bulk sale?

23:33.440 --> 23:38.320
Listen, hey, do you want some scary as shit dolls at a low, low price?

23:38.320 --> 23:40.720
Have I got a group deal for you?

23:40.720 --> 23:42.800
I want all these bastards gone.

23:42.800 --> 23:44.240
Here's my question.

23:44.240 --> 23:46.640
Usually when you do a haunted doll watch, it's like,

23:46.640 --> 23:49.360
they will watch over you when you sleep and they go,

23:49.360 --> 23:50.320
healing power.

23:50.320 --> 23:53.440
Who is scanning through eBay like,

23:53.440 --> 23:55.520
where's the scariest part?

23:55.520 --> 23:58.720
Where's the scariest fucking asshole I can buy?

23:59.760 --> 24:01.200
I mean, they're all pretty scary to me, but.

24:02.240 --> 24:02.720
I don't know.

24:02.720 --> 24:04.880
It's scary at first, but then if you get one that's like,

24:05.840 --> 24:06.400
I got you.

24:06.400 --> 24:08.080
I have calming energies.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.760
That would actually be right now.

24:10.640 --> 24:11.520
Kind of nice.

24:11.520 --> 24:11.760
All right.

24:11.760 --> 24:13.120
Griffin, did you ever Yahoo?

24:13.120 --> 24:13.920
I did.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.440
And it is sent by level 9,000.

24:15.440 --> 24:15.600
Yeah.

24:15.600 --> 24:17.200
Drew Drew at Drew Davenport.

24:20.320 --> 24:22.560
It's Yajuru answers user.

24:22.560 --> 24:23.040
Sorry.

24:23.040 --> 24:25.200
Sorry, something has gone wrong.

24:27.200 --> 24:32.320
We're trying to reload the page and see if the data will appear on my laptop.

24:33.760 --> 24:35.200
It has not appeared on the lap.

24:36.960 --> 24:38.240
Cause I'm going to call this one.

24:38.880 --> 24:40.160
Annabelle Randy.

24:41.920 --> 24:43.120
Randibell asks.

24:45.440 --> 24:48.960
If someone came up with the idea of a meat drink,

24:48.960 --> 24:50.320
would you drink it?

24:51.600 --> 24:54.880
It seems as if people will try anything these days.

24:56.640 --> 24:58.080
What I want to order.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.840
You did come up with the idea of a meat drink.

24:59.840 --> 25:03.200
What if someone came up with, oh, wait, I just did.

25:03.200 --> 25:03.920
Oh no.

25:03.920 --> 25:05.600
I just came up with the idea of a meat drink.

25:05.600 --> 25:08.400
We've made drink out of everything.

25:08.400 --> 25:08.900
Yeah.

25:09.440 --> 25:10.240
Vegetables.

25:10.240 --> 25:10.740
Yes.

25:11.200 --> 25:11.920
Fruits.

25:11.920 --> 25:12.420
Yes.

25:12.960 --> 25:13.520
Grains.

25:13.520 --> 25:14.020
Yes.

25:14.800 --> 25:15.520
Orbits.

25:15.520 --> 25:16.020
Orbits.

25:16.020 --> 25:16.520
Orbits.

25:16.520 --> 25:17.020
Orbits.

25:17.020 --> 25:17.520
Orbits.

25:17.520 --> 25:18.020
Orbits.

25:18.020 --> 25:19.020
Orbits.

25:19.020 --> 25:19.520
Orbits.

25:19.520 --> 25:20.720
The fifth element.

25:22.000 --> 25:22.500
Zima.

25:22.500 --> 25:23.000
Zima.

25:23.000 --> 25:23.500
Zima.

25:23.500 --> 25:24.400
The sixth element.

25:25.680 --> 25:29.200
But now meat, you got to cloak it pretty good.

25:29.200 --> 25:33.120
I think like V8 won't even, doesn't have the courage to put vegetable in it.

25:33.120 --> 25:34.640
They're going to shorten it.

25:34.640 --> 25:38.720
If they could just call that drink vegetables lots, no one would like it.

25:38.720 --> 25:40.320
But you do have, they put an eight.

25:40.320 --> 25:41.520
So it's a finite number.

25:41.520 --> 25:43.680
Like, yes, there are vegetables and there's a limited number.

25:43.680 --> 25:44.800
I'm drinking eight.

25:44.800 --> 25:47.600
No veggies though, but so you got to hide the meat.

25:47.600 --> 25:53.120
So what I think you should do is it should just say on the bottle Pepsi, but then in

25:53.120 --> 26:00.480
really small letters below that it says meat and it doesn't have a lot of meat.

26:00.480 --> 26:04.640
It could just be one little, when you start production, it could just be one tiny little

26:04.640 --> 26:06.560
boba tea bubble of meat.

26:06.560 --> 26:07.060
Yeah.

26:07.060 --> 26:09.760
And you could be drinking your Pepsi unaware and just like,

26:09.760 --> 26:15.840
Okay, a lot of you just went, oh, how often do you drink your Pepsi and think, I wonder what's in this.

26:15.840 --> 26:22.080
So what I'm saying is you do that and then gradually over the weeks and months, you add

26:22.080 --> 26:28.000
a little more meat into it and you make the font bigger on meat.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.760
So eventually it just says meat.

26:31.760 --> 26:36.240
And then at the bottom, like printed on the bottom, it says like a Pepsi Coke bottle.

26:36.240 --> 26:40.880
And then at the bottom, like printed on the bottom, it says like a Pepsi Coke product.

26:40.880 --> 26:43.760
And it's pretty much all meat at that point.

26:43.760 --> 26:46.480
Just a big cylinder of meat in a drink.

26:46.480 --> 26:53.680
This is great because I feel like the biggest roadblock of any new culinary idea is just

26:53.680 --> 26:56.480
getting people over their hangups.

26:58.080 --> 26:58.800
No?

26:58.800 --> 27:02.800
Yeah, just do you have a solution for it or?

27:02.800 --> 27:04.160
I don't know.

27:04.160 --> 27:08.480
Maybe tell them they've been drinking meat all along and something else.

27:08.480 --> 27:09.480
Wouldn't be right.

27:09.480 --> 27:11.280
I don't know meat, but like, what do you think is an orange juice?

27:11.280 --> 27:12.280
Oh shit, you're right.

27:12.280 --> 27:13.280
Oh shit, you're right.

27:13.280 --> 27:14.280
I guess there's meat in it.

27:14.280 --> 27:15.480
Orange juice is just like fruit meat.

27:15.480 --> 27:17.680
I possess no critical thinking skills.

27:17.680 --> 27:20.000
So yeah, I guess orange juice is meat.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.960
You just got to get like a Kardashian and be like, I love meat drink.

27:22.960 --> 27:25.960
I love meat drink, by which I mean Sunny Delight.

27:25.960 --> 27:26.960
Paul's got my meat drink.

27:26.960 --> 27:27.960
Hold on.

27:27.960 --> 27:32.600
Thanks, Paul.

27:32.600 --> 27:34.320
It's just coffee.

27:34.320 --> 27:39.720
Hey, with booze, uh, broth, oops.

27:39.720 --> 27:40.720
Oh, man.

27:40.720 --> 27:41.720
Shit!

27:41.720 --> 27:42.720
I just thought.

27:42.720 --> 27:43.720
Shit!

27:43.720 --> 27:44.720
Damn it.

27:44.720 --> 27:45.720
It is like a meat.

27:45.720 --> 27:46.720
Damn it.

27:46.720 --> 27:50.600
You've been drinking it this whole time.

27:50.600 --> 27:53.200
Well, hopefully you have not been drinking bra.

27:53.200 --> 27:57.960
Hope we don't have an audience of octogenarians that have just been nursing broth this whole

27:57.960 --> 27:58.960
time.

27:58.960 --> 27:59.960
My God.

27:59.960 --> 28:03.560
Damn it, it was right in front of us the whole time.

28:03.560 --> 28:04.560
Damn it, broth.

28:04.560 --> 28:05.560
God damn.

28:05.560 --> 28:07.600
I got, uh, another question.

28:07.600 --> 28:08.600
Okay.

28:08.600 --> 28:09.600
All right.

28:09.600 --> 28:13.600
I'm an illustrator pursuing my art degree at an art school.

28:13.600 --> 28:16.880
We get it.

28:16.880 --> 28:22.080
In the area and noticed something troubling during my time at art school.

28:22.080 --> 28:26.060
We have to take figure drawing classes, you know, where you draw naked people for hours

28:26.060 --> 28:27.680
in basically the dark.

28:27.680 --> 28:29.520
It's a great way to learn about the human body.

28:29.520 --> 28:35.680
But whenever we have male models, many of my class rates, classmates refuse to draw

28:35.680 --> 28:38.520
the Pippis.

28:38.520 --> 28:42.760
How do you advise and encourage my fellow students to stop being cowards and draw that

28:42.760 --> 28:45.640
dang dick already?

28:45.640 --> 28:52.120
See, like we said, very sexual show.

28:52.120 --> 28:53.800
Wait, wait, wait.

28:53.800 --> 28:54.800
Are you here?

28:54.800 --> 28:55.800
Yeah.

28:55.800 --> 28:56.800
Very close.

28:56.800 --> 29:04.440
When you say refuse, like refuse, is it like they just drove and someone loudly announces

29:04.440 --> 29:12.280
I'm going to stop at the day and there's nothing you could say to, isn't this homework?

29:12.280 --> 29:16.440
You can't, the dog ate the penis part of my drawing.

29:16.440 --> 29:25.860
When you turn it in, does the teacher return it with like a circle and an X like, you came

29:25.860 --> 29:27.280
so close.

29:27.280 --> 29:29.640
Your art was wrong.

29:29.640 --> 29:36.840
I am into this idea of just drawing all of it, including that nasty thing.

29:36.840 --> 29:41.080
And then you just grab at the penis part of the art and you tear it away.

29:41.080 --> 29:47.360
And then you could say like, got caught in the subway doors again.

29:47.360 --> 29:56.520
If you were the person who was modeling for this and after the class you were like, I'm

29:56.520 --> 29:59.200
going to go look at some of the art.

29:59.200 --> 30:04.560
And then you looked at all the art and no one drew your dick.

30:04.560 --> 30:12.240
You might have a second or two where you're like, why did I have to have my dick?

30:12.240 --> 30:19.120
I mean, if you aren't going to, it's kind of a tree falls in the forest kind of thing

30:19.120 --> 30:20.120
of like.

30:20.120 --> 30:23.560
If a tree falls in the forest and nobody saw the tree stick.

30:23.560 --> 30:28.360
If nobody, if you don't want to draw my dick, I don't want you to draw my dick, I'm fine.

30:28.360 --> 30:36.220
If you're modeling and no one draws your dick, you pretty much just had your dick out basically.

30:36.220 --> 30:40.120
Maybe like a nice bikini brief down there to make people feel more comfortable.

30:40.120 --> 30:41.120
That's worse, I feel like.

30:41.120 --> 30:42.120
It's worse, isn't it?

30:42.120 --> 30:48.000
Here's what you do then, you have the model wears underpants.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Maybe me on these.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.400
And this is beautiful, beautiful by the way.

30:51.400 --> 30:52.400
Yeah.

30:52.400 --> 30:53.400
This whole process is beautiful.

30:53.400 --> 30:56.960
I don't want to stigmatize nude art drawings.

30:56.960 --> 30:57.960
Nude art is great.

30:57.960 --> 30:59.520
They're wearing their underpants, right?

30:59.520 --> 31:01.540
And then whoever wants to draw that can.

31:01.540 --> 31:03.440
And then they leave and anyone who doesn't want to.

31:03.440 --> 31:04.920
And then the real fun begins.

31:04.920 --> 31:10.880
And then someone else comes in and they're wearing a bodysuit except for a cutout around

31:10.880 --> 31:13.680
their penis.

31:13.680 --> 31:18.800
And then anyone who wants to draw the penis can finish the drawing.

31:18.800 --> 31:27.600
Alternatively, we take the art drawn by your coward classmates who are afraid of this beautiful-

31:27.600 --> 31:29.320
Afraid of the human body.

31:29.320 --> 31:38.680
And we just fill in the space by going online on literally any game that involves drawing

31:38.680 --> 31:45.720
at all, any sort of universe, literally anything where anybody is allowed to draw anything

31:45.720 --> 31:47.320
in an online environment.

31:47.320 --> 31:53.080
And we take the ocean of dicks from those and we copy and paste.

31:53.080 --> 31:58.960
What if you maybe sort of adjusted the pose of the life model so their pose was sort of

31:58.960 --> 31:59.960
like, huh?

31:59.960 --> 32:00.960
Undeniable.

32:00.960 --> 32:05.680
Like pointing two fingers with the finger guns pointing at their penis.

32:05.680 --> 32:10.760
Because then if you draw that and don't draw what they're pointing to, that is bad art.

32:10.760 --> 32:14.520
We're about five minutes in, by the way, and that's the first time one of us said the word

32:14.520 --> 32:17.520
penis.

32:17.520 --> 32:18.520
Fair enough.

32:18.520 --> 32:20.560
We're children.

32:20.560 --> 32:24.400
I am right now picturing a television show.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.120
Not how I thought that was going to-

32:26.120 --> 32:33.560
No, maybe a YouTube series of somebody in like a green screen bodysuit except for a

32:33.560 --> 32:35.360
cutout around the penis.

32:35.360 --> 32:36.360
Oh, no, no, no, no.

32:36.360 --> 32:37.360
No, I wouldn't watch that.

32:37.360 --> 32:41.240
And then it's just the adventures of a penis hanging out in different places.

32:41.240 --> 32:42.240
Yeah.

32:42.240 --> 32:43.240
And listen, I know.

32:43.240 --> 32:44.240
No, you don't.

32:44.240 --> 32:45.240
I don't think-

32:45.240 --> 32:46.800
But I'm a child and I think it's funny as shit.

32:46.800 --> 32:47.800
All right.

32:47.800 --> 32:51.720
But that place would have to be the bathroom or the bedroom, the two places that-

32:51.720 --> 32:55.000
The two places you could shoot something like that.

32:55.000 --> 33:00.680
Maybe come up with like, draw your art and then get like copies of your drawing in sticker

33:00.680 --> 33:01.680
form.

33:01.680 --> 33:05.560
And then you can just walk around and like add it to everyone's drawing and be like,

33:05.560 --> 33:06.560
you're welcome.

33:06.560 --> 33:07.560
Collabo.

33:07.560 --> 33:08.560
Yeah.

33:08.560 --> 33:09.560
You can borrow my penis that I drew.

33:09.560 --> 33:11.040
I worked really hard on it.

33:11.040 --> 33:15.080
Maybe you should draw just the penis next time.

33:15.080 --> 33:17.360
How about this, everyone?

33:17.360 --> 33:19.360
We have another Yahoo.

33:19.360 --> 33:25.120
I feel exhausted by the tone of the episode.

33:25.120 --> 33:27.400
This one was also sent in by level 9,000 Yadru Dru.

33:27.400 --> 33:30.400
Dru Davenport, thank you, Dru.

33:30.400 --> 33:39.160
It's from Yadru Answers user, Jonathan Santana, who asks, is it possible to build a toy with

33:39.160 --> 33:50.800
fake muscles, skin, veins, bones, organs, et cetera?

33:50.800 --> 34:02.400
I want to have a toy Smurf with fake muscles, veins, skin, bones, organs, et cetera.

34:02.400 --> 34:03.400
You know.

34:03.400 --> 34:07.280
Sorry, I read that wrong.

34:07.280 --> 34:11.480
I want to have a toy Smurf with fake muscles, veins, skin, bones, organs, et cetera.

34:11.480 --> 34:13.640
You know.

34:13.640 --> 34:14.640
I don't.

34:14.640 --> 34:18.880
So, where can I possibly order to get one and what would be an estimate on how much

34:18.880 --> 34:19.880
it would cost?

34:19.880 --> 34:24.160
Yes, I want it to be realistic, not fake looking.

34:24.160 --> 34:29.320
This person wants to get into some Gargamel play, and I appreciate that, and I celebrate

34:29.320 --> 34:30.320
them.

34:30.320 --> 34:31.920
What does Gargamel play entail?

34:31.920 --> 34:34.560
He asks, terrified.

34:34.560 --> 34:38.040
It's just like, welcome to another Gargamel play video.

34:38.040 --> 34:44.080
I'm going to squish some more of those delicious Smurfs with my sexy red boots, and then you

34:44.080 --> 34:47.080
just squish them for money on a webcam.

34:47.080 --> 34:48.080
But just Smurfs?

34:48.080 --> 34:51.080
How did we turn this one?

34:51.080 --> 34:52.080
Okay.

34:52.080 --> 34:53.080
Okay.

34:53.080 --> 34:54.080
Hold on.

34:54.080 --> 35:01.040
To that point, Griffin, if somebody says, I want a toy with muscles, skin, bones, and

35:01.040 --> 35:10.360
organs, they're either going to crush it in a movie that they're making at home, like

35:10.360 --> 35:17.680
autopsy it, that's worse, fuck it or eat it.

35:17.680 --> 35:20.440
You just kind of slid that in there, I noticed.

35:20.440 --> 35:22.880
I noticed you just kind of slid that in there.

35:22.880 --> 35:26.000
No, I stand by it.

35:26.000 --> 35:34.240
It's just, I'm so tired of talking about- I should make it clear, I know we're talking

35:34.240 --> 35:36.000
about a lot of dirty stuff.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.560
If y'all try to get up to those audience lengths and ask those dirty questions, I'll

35:39.560 --> 35:40.560
disappear.

35:40.560 --> 35:43.560
It's kind of an act one, act two thing, okay?

35:43.560 --> 35:44.560
Oh, shit.

35:44.560 --> 35:49.640
Do you think they want to make a fake crime scene and maybe they want to play Smurf Pro

35:49.640 --> 35:50.640
and they want to have-

35:50.640 --> 35:51.640
Somebody Smurf this guy.

35:51.640 --> 35:52.640
Somebody Smurf this fucking dude.

35:52.640 --> 35:53.640
His Smurf and Smurf guts are everywhere.

35:53.640 --> 35:54.640
I'm going to Smurf.

35:54.640 --> 36:03.640
Yahoo Answers user Drake Bijou answered, check in stores.

36:03.640 --> 36:07.840
And that's the best answer.

36:07.840 --> 36:13.000
Please, please, please, please go to your local Toys R Us or KB Toys.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.920
Hey, I'm looking for a-

36:14.920 --> 36:16.360
So let me know if you have this.

36:16.360 --> 36:20.080
I know holidays are around, inventory limited, I get it.

36:20.080 --> 36:21.720
And I should have been more proactive with this.

36:21.720 --> 36:26.560
I'm looking for a Smurf with real muscles, veins, skin, bones, organs, et cetera.

36:26.560 --> 36:27.560
Real skin?

36:27.560 --> 36:28.560
Yes.

36:28.560 --> 36:30.440
You heard me.

36:30.440 --> 36:31.440
And I know-

36:31.440 --> 36:32.720
The customer is always right.

36:32.720 --> 36:34.880
I could just go on Amazon, but you know what?

36:34.880 --> 36:38.720
I support local shops.

36:38.720 --> 36:39.720
Like Toys R Us.

36:39.720 --> 36:42.200
Mom and pop shops.

36:42.200 --> 36:46.640
Mom and pop Smurf body shops.

36:46.640 --> 36:47.640
Buy your Smurf.

36:47.640 --> 36:48.640
God bless.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.680
Can you imagine if you went into a Toys R Us and said that to an employee, like, we don't

36:50.680 --> 36:54.040
have it, but-

36:54.040 --> 36:55.040
I know a guy.

36:55.040 --> 36:58.320
I know a guy who can get the Smurf.

36:58.320 --> 37:02.040
He's the grossest person ever.

37:02.040 --> 37:05.600
That's kind of his thing is he's really gross, but he'll have what you need.

37:05.600 --> 37:09.400
I really should have kept my head on a swivel with this question because I should have known

37:09.400 --> 37:12.920
there's only really one use for a Smurf with real organs.

37:12.920 --> 37:13.920
Yeah.

37:13.920 --> 37:14.920
What's that?

37:14.920 --> 37:15.920
I'm sorry, everybody.

37:15.920 --> 37:16.920
What's that?

37:16.920 --> 37:17.920
Perfect.

37:17.920 --> 37:18.920
It's probably smudged in there.

37:18.920 --> 37:19.920
Zach's already eaten.

37:19.920 --> 37:22.080
I feel like I've disappointed myself.

37:22.080 --> 37:24.080
That's all right.

37:24.080 --> 37:27.400
Daddy, can I listen to your podcast?

37:27.400 --> 37:28.400
No.

37:28.400 --> 37:29.400
No.

37:29.400 --> 37:30.400
Not this one.

37:30.400 --> 37:31.400
No.

37:31.400 --> 37:32.400
Daddy wishes he didn't listen to his podcast.

37:32.400 --> 37:39.880
I don't see why the next generation should.

37:39.880 --> 37:46.360
Hey, everybody.

37:46.360 --> 37:47.360
This is Griffin.

37:47.360 --> 37:52.440
Thank you so much for listening to our live episode from Jesus, like last November that

37:52.440 --> 37:54.200
we recorded in Milwaukee.

37:54.200 --> 37:57.680
I think at this point we've put up all of the shows from our Midwest tour.

37:57.680 --> 38:04.440
We had such a great time, and thank you Midwestern territory for welcoming us with wide open

38:04.440 --> 38:05.560
arms.

38:05.560 --> 38:12.700
Sorry that we were turning the favor by turning in an inexplicably randy episode.

38:12.700 --> 38:17.340
We're putting up a live show because Justin and Sydney just had a baby, and we are very

38:17.340 --> 38:18.760
happy and very excited.

38:18.760 --> 38:24.640
I'm going to be traveling this weekend to Huntington to go meet her, and yeah, we're

38:24.640 --> 38:28.160
really excited, and so Justin's taking a little bit of time off.

38:28.160 --> 38:31.360
We got this live episode for you, and we hope that you enjoy it.

38:31.360 --> 38:34.500
I'm here right now to tell you about our advertisers this week.

38:34.500 --> 38:37.080
Our first one is Squarespace.

38:37.080 --> 38:38.240
Squarespace is great.

38:38.240 --> 38:42.600
We used it to make McElroyShows.com, and I used it to make GriffinMcElroy.com.

40:32.080 --> 40:34.800
I also want to tell you all about Casper.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.720
We are supported in part by Casper this week.

40:36.720 --> 40:40.840
It's a sleep brand that continues to revolutionize its line of products to create an exceptionally

40:40.840 --> 40:43.680
comfortable sleep experience one night at a time.

40:43.680 --> 40:47.400
They offer affordable prices because Casper cuts out the middleman and sells directly

40:47.400 --> 40:48.920
to the consumer.

40:48.920 --> 40:50.160
We have a Casper mattress.

40:50.160 --> 40:56.000
We all do, actually, that we all sleep on, and I got one in the guest room that I sleep

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
on, and it's so comfy.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.960
I sleep on it only occasionally, and I've talked about my reasons for doing so, and

41:02.960 --> 41:06.760
I'm not going to get into it again, but they are gastrointestinal in nature, and I don't

41:06.760 --> 41:10.480
think Casper loves it when I bring that up, but it's a very, very comfortable bed regardless

41:10.480 --> 41:11.880
of why you sleep on it.

41:11.880 --> 41:16.760
Casper brand mattresses combine multiple supportive memory foams for a quality sleep surface

41:16.760 --> 41:20.280
with the right amount of sink and the right amount of ounce.

41:20.280 --> 41:24.960
You can be sure of your purchase with Casper's 100-night risk-free sleep on it trial.

41:24.960 --> 41:30.360
You can also get $50 towards selected mattresses by visiting Casper.com slash MYBROTHER and

41:30.360 --> 41:32.880
using the promo code MYBROTHER at checkout.

41:32.880 --> 41:36.360
Terms and conditions, they do apply on that one.

41:36.360 --> 41:37.720
Got a few Jumbotrons here.

41:37.720 --> 41:43.480
This first one is to tell you all about Megan and RJ's quest to ruin classic literature

41:43.480 --> 41:49.100
one book at a time on the podcast Oh No Lit Class, which is a very good name for a podcast.

41:49.100 --> 41:52.800
You can listen to it at ohnolitclass.com or wherever you get your podcasts.

41:52.800 --> 41:57.560
Oh No Lit Class is a comedy literature podcast hosted by two bitter English grads here to

41:57.560 --> 42:02.640
tell you all the weird and sexy things you never knew about the books you had to read

42:02.640 --> 42:03.640
in school.

42:03.640 --> 42:07.920
They're a fun, foul-mouthed, rather they are, we're also pretty fun and foul-mouthed,

42:07.920 --> 42:12.480
but they're a fun, foul-mouthed spark notes for your ears, mixing plot summaries, author

42:12.480 --> 42:19.240
bios, and trivia with filthy jokes, bad impressions, and worse singing.

42:19.240 --> 42:23.920
Learn what book was written as a petty act of spite, how the author of The Scarlet Letter

42:23.920 --> 42:27.360
got stuck shoveling poop, huh?

42:27.360 --> 42:30.720
And why Dracula absolutely deserves to be kink-shamed.

42:30.720 --> 42:32.080
I don't know if I agree with that.

42:32.080 --> 42:33.080
I don't own that.

42:33.080 --> 42:36.440
Sometimes we just read the things that people write in the letters, although I do want to

42:36.440 --> 42:37.440
know more.

42:37.440 --> 42:41.920
Okay, anyway, that's Oh No Lit Class, ohnolitclass.com or wherever you get your podcasts.

42:41.920 --> 42:48.280
I have a message here for Chelsea, and it's from Rob the Best, and Rob wrote that, so

42:48.280 --> 42:50.240
keep that in mind as I read this message.

42:50.240 --> 42:52.360
Hey Chelsea, you are such a great friend.

42:52.360 --> 42:56.700
It is such a blast playing board games, world building, and spending hours theory crafting

42:56.700 --> 42:58.440
Dark Souls lore together.

42:58.440 --> 43:00.560
That's absolutely my jam.

43:00.560 --> 43:04.720
Previously you paid the brothers to say that I was the best, and now I am paying them to

43:04.720 --> 43:06.880
officially make you the coolest.

43:06.880 --> 43:09.080
Seriously brothers, she is the coolest.

43:09.080 --> 43:11.400
Here's to more Gundyr goofs.

43:11.400 --> 43:14.280
There's nothing funny about Champion Gundyr.

43:14.280 --> 43:19.560
You know, they've been through a lot, and they're a real pain in the ass for a boss.

43:19.560 --> 43:22.720
Boy, I hope everybody listening to this is playing Dark Souls 3.

43:22.720 --> 43:24.600
Anyway, congratulations Chelsea.

43:24.600 --> 43:26.300
You are now officially the coolest.

43:26.300 --> 43:27.300
Got another message here.

43:27.300 --> 43:30.360
This one's for Bill, and it's from Gretchen and Casey, who say, Bill!

43:30.360 --> 43:32.400
We're so excited that you're moving to Portland.

43:32.400 --> 43:35.640
We're really looking forward to spending more, I don't know why I made that sound sarcastic.

43:35.640 --> 43:40.160
We're really looking forward to spending more time with you in old ways.

43:40.160 --> 43:41.800
Metal Gear?

43:41.800 --> 43:43.280
Metal Gear?

43:43.280 --> 43:45.920
And new, McElroy show listening parties?

43:45.920 --> 43:46.920
Combine those two.

43:46.920 --> 43:49.840
Ain't no, ain't no law against that.

43:49.840 --> 43:54.200
May Mansionland West continue to grow in numbers and radness.

43:54.200 --> 43:56.880
Love, Casey, and Gretchen.

43:56.880 --> 44:00.000
Congratulations, Metal Gear?

44:00.000 --> 44:02.320
Metal Gear?

44:02.320 --> 44:03.320
Metal Gear?

44:03.320 --> 44:07.560
Hey, thanks for listening to the show, and thank you for tweeting about the show.

44:07.560 --> 44:10.320
And thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's

44:10.320 --> 44:12.160
a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

44:12.160 --> 44:13.640
Thanks for the Maximum Fun Network.

44:13.640 --> 44:18.080
Well, thanks to them, but thanks for them, God and Jesus.

44:18.080 --> 44:19.340
So many great shows on the network.

44:19.340 --> 44:22.600
Just go to MaximumFun.org, and you're just gonna love what you hear.

44:22.600 --> 44:24.360
I'm gonna hop off here now.

44:24.360 --> 44:29.360
I think we'll probably have a new episode next, I mean, we'll have an episode next week,

44:29.360 --> 44:32.760
but I think Justin will be back and ready to record.

44:32.760 --> 44:36.240
So we will be around to knock out a new episode for you.

44:36.240 --> 44:38.200
And I hope you'll stay tuned for that one.

44:38.200 --> 44:41.200
So I'll talk to you next week, and goodbye.

44:41.200 --> 44:42.760
Hey, this is Griffin McElroy.

44:42.760 --> 44:44.280
Hi, this is Rachel McElroy.

44:44.280 --> 44:46.720
And we've got a new podcast on Maximum Fun called Wonderful.

44:46.720 --> 44:47.720
Wonderful.

44:47.720 --> 44:50.480
It's an enthusiast podcast where we talk about things that we're excited about and things

44:50.480 --> 44:51.760
that you're excited about.

44:51.760 --> 44:53.320
Things like overalls.

44:53.320 --> 44:55.480
24-hour Sudafed.

44:55.480 --> 44:56.840
The grand prize game.

44:56.840 --> 44:59.400
The fact that wombats use their butts to kill predators.

44:59.400 --> 45:01.380
The soundtrack to the movie Dick Tracy.

45:01.380 --> 45:03.760
The beach potion we call Bud Lightline.

45:03.760 --> 45:07.040
All these things and more every Wednesday, and we'll also talk about things that you're

45:07.040 --> 45:08.040
excited about.

45:08.040 --> 45:10.400
You can find us on MaximumFun.org or iTunes or wherever.

45:10.400 --> 45:11.800
I don't know, just search Wonderful.

45:11.800 --> 45:12.800
Google it.

45:12.800 --> 45:13.800
You'll probably get there.

45:13.800 --> 45:21.480
Travis is exhausted right now and probably will be for the remainder of the show.

45:21.480 --> 45:25.280
You know how you're like, oh, when I go to a rock show and it takes them forever to come

45:25.280 --> 45:27.120
on stage, they're probably like partying.

45:27.120 --> 45:34.040
No, I had to use the bathroom, but it was upstairs, and we pressed for the elevator

45:34.040 --> 45:38.120
and it was taking a while and I thought, I'll just run up eight stairs.

45:38.120 --> 45:43.980
Eight flights of stairs, not eight huge one-story high stairs.

45:43.980 --> 45:47.120
And I made it four floors.

45:47.120 --> 45:50.840
And we had already called the elevator, so the elevator came down and we were like, don't

45:50.840 --> 45:51.840
worry about it.

45:51.840 --> 45:52.840
He's running up the stairs.

45:52.840 --> 45:55.200
So they're like, okay, fine, and then he ran back down.

45:55.200 --> 45:58.720
And I came slow, ran, thank you so much for that.

45:58.720 --> 46:00.440
I hobbled back down the stairs.

46:00.440 --> 46:02.720
I was like, what was I thinking?

46:02.720 --> 46:05.340
And then we had to call the elevator again.

46:05.340 --> 46:08.600
And when we say call the elevator, there's a literal person who's running.

46:08.600 --> 46:09.600
There's Maya.

46:09.600 --> 46:10.600
And they know our shame.

46:10.600 --> 46:11.600
Yes.

46:11.600 --> 46:12.600
Maya's running.

46:12.600 --> 46:16.920
So we're going to start doing some auditions.

46:16.920 --> 46:18.920
Okay.

46:18.920 --> 46:22.440
All right.

46:22.440 --> 46:46.840
We're going to turn this, we're going to turn things over to, oh my gosh, it's never happened.

46:46.840 --> 47:03.760
Hey everybody, welcome to Munch Squad.

47:03.760 --> 47:06.320
It's a podcast inside a podcast.

47:06.320 --> 47:08.600
What a delight.

47:08.600 --> 47:12.720
Now, Griffin, why did you IP theft our brother?

47:12.720 --> 47:17.720
I IP thefted our brother because in the two hours preceding the show, Justin was unconscious

47:17.720 --> 47:20.040
for an hour and a half of it.

47:20.040 --> 47:25.480
And I thought I would sort of help you out with a Munch Squad.

47:25.480 --> 47:31.480
There's one pair of footprints tracked through an Arby's is where you carried me.

47:31.480 --> 47:33.960
Here where you stepped on all the roast beef.

47:33.960 --> 47:38.860
That was because there are horny people on the internet and my child.

47:38.860 --> 47:39.860
We can't say the word.

47:39.860 --> 47:46.240
All right, banned words for the half two of the show, horny, boner, any variation of pep

47:46.240 --> 47:49.640
is peep is beeper.

47:49.640 --> 47:52.360
Beeper is even off limits.

47:52.360 --> 48:00.040
So Taco Bell's done something returning Munch Squad favorite Taco Bell.

48:00.040 --> 48:09.280
Well this is a, they're sort of, they're broadening the horizons of what Munch Squad can be.

48:09.280 --> 48:19.440
It's a collabo project with food favorite Forever 21.

48:19.440 --> 48:24.560
Press release, Taco Bell and Forever 21 are making wardrobes a whole lot saucier this

48:24.560 --> 48:25.560
fall.

48:25.560 --> 48:26.560
Oh no.

48:26.560 --> 48:27.560
Excellent.

48:27.560 --> 48:28.560
Excellent.

48:28.560 --> 48:34.760
Taco Bell and Forever 21 will come together this October, this is an older one, this October

48:34.760 --> 48:40.160
to celebrate personal style and self-expression ahead of the launch of Taco Bell's first fashion

48:40.160 --> 48:43.600
collection collaboration.

48:43.600 --> 48:46.280
These two like-minded brands.

48:46.280 --> 48:47.280
What?

48:47.280 --> 48:48.280
Accurate.

48:48.280 --> 48:49.280
Accurate.

48:49.280 --> 48:50.280
Together.

48:50.280 --> 48:51.280
Together.

48:51.280 --> 48:53.840
We both want to sell stuff.

48:53.840 --> 49:01.480
Together at the intersection of culture and innovation.

49:01.480 --> 49:02.480
Our joining.

49:02.480 --> 49:03.680
Welcome to our Ted Talk.

49:03.680 --> 49:08.000
Our joining forces to make fall wardrobes a whole lot saucier.

49:08.000 --> 49:13.520
While they're at it, they'll help fans keep the heat up and the fun on in more ways than

49:13.520 --> 49:15.320
one.

49:15.320 --> 49:22.640
Unless these clothes are lined with hot sauce, there is only the one way that clothes keep

49:22.640 --> 49:24.400
you warm.

49:24.400 --> 49:33.840
By capturing the content that personifies, quote, forever Taco Bell, you literally just

49:33.840 --> 49:40.200
described college.

49:40.200 --> 49:43.920
The essence of the preview event, fans can actively take part in the ultimate fashion

49:43.920 --> 49:47.320
afterparty.

49:47.320 --> 49:53.600
Here's some quotes from Marissa Thalberg, chief marketing officer at Taco Bell Corp,

49:53.600 --> 49:55.960
who has almost certainly been on the show before.

49:55.960 --> 49:56.960
Certainly.

49:56.960 --> 50:01.880
We often think of Taco Bell as the fast fashion of food.

50:01.880 --> 50:04.360
What?

50:04.360 --> 50:06.160
What could that possibly mean?

50:06.160 --> 50:11.800
You don't even think of Taco Bell as the fast food of food.

50:11.800 --> 50:16.760
We often think of Taco Bell as the fast fashion of food, given how we continuously introduce

50:16.760 --> 50:21.040
innovative, limited edition products that everyone can enjoy.

50:21.040 --> 50:24.000
So when it came to- Assuming they don't have IBS.

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
Yeah.

50:25.000 --> 50:29.160
So when it came time for our first ever retail collaboration, we knew our partner had to

50:29.160 --> 50:31.960
be the leader in actual fast fashion.

50:31.960 --> 50:32.960
Is that something?

50:32.960 --> 50:36.240
Is that something?

50:36.240 --> 50:40.000
We've seen our fans get individually creative in expressing their love for Taco Bell through

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
fashion.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.120
No, you haven't.

50:42.120 --> 50:49.960
You've seen sweatpants and more sweatpants.

50:49.960 --> 50:53.560
And we believe this collection with Forever 21 is going to be everything they could expect

50:53.560 --> 51:00.640
from us in extending the Taco Bell lifestyle, sad, to fashion, original, affordable, creative,

51:00.640 --> 51:03.120
a little quirky, and definitely fun.

51:03.120 --> 51:04.120
So fun.

51:04.120 --> 51:05.600
Can I jump back a little bit?

51:05.600 --> 51:11.920
I love that they say, we often think of Taco Bell as something like, okay, you can think

51:11.920 --> 51:16.280
about your own thing in whatever way you want, unless you can say other people think about

51:16.280 --> 51:17.280
it.

51:17.280 --> 51:18.280
It ain't true.

51:18.280 --> 51:24.080
I'm going to read this next quote from Linda Chang, Forever 21 Vice President of Merchandising,

51:24.080 --> 51:29.800
who says in her first sentence, we are excited about this partnership with Taco Bell.

51:29.800 --> 51:33.800
This is what you got in the fashion industry, right Linda?

51:33.800 --> 51:36.640
It's maybe a bit of a one-sided relationship.

51:36.640 --> 51:40.520
Forever 21, hell yeah, fast food fashion.

51:40.520 --> 51:42.720
That's nothing, but we're here for it.

51:42.720 --> 51:43.720
Yeah, it's fine.

51:43.720 --> 51:47.080
Like I said, we're just trying to beat Amazon.

51:47.080 --> 51:52.880
Food like fashion is driven by trends and culture, I guess.

51:52.880 --> 51:57.000
Merging fashion and food in this collection gives our customers a new way to experience

51:57.000 --> 51:59.440
both our brands.

51:59.440 --> 52:03.520
When was the last time food was driven by trends?

52:03.520 --> 52:09.080
The only time that food, Taco Bell, and fashion have combined is when you get meat on your

52:09.080 --> 52:11.640
pants from your Taco Bell accident.

52:11.640 --> 52:16.580
That said, I am excited to hear there's a way I can experience the Taco Bell brand without

52:16.580 --> 52:18.000
ingesting it.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.840
I'm excited I'm going to do that other avenue.

52:20.840 --> 52:24.320
Because you want to support them, but God, not through my mouth.

52:24.320 --> 52:29.880
Yeah, this is the one human body I have.

52:29.880 --> 52:33.520
I assume that their combination of sauce and clothing is sauce on clothing.

52:33.520 --> 52:35.880
No, it's clothing that looks like sauce.

52:35.880 --> 52:38.880
It's very fun and very Spencer's Gifts.

52:38.880 --> 52:41.880
Why not Spencer's Gifts?

52:41.880 --> 52:43.680
Look in the deep dark truth of Merit Taco Bell.

52:43.680 --> 52:46.320
All right, so we want to get to audience questions now?

52:46.320 --> 52:47.320
Audience questions.

52:47.320 --> 52:48.320
What?

52:48.320 --> 52:49.320
I want to munch.

52:49.320 --> 52:50.320
I want to munch.

52:50.320 --> 53:10.320
You know I was going to take care of you, Milwaukee.

53:10.320 --> 53:14.320
Infermed or no, you will munch.

53:14.320 --> 53:17.320
We will munch together.

53:17.320 --> 53:23.560
This comes to us direct from Miami, is the date line on this particular release.

53:23.560 --> 53:31.800
Burger King restaurants uniquely use fire to flame grill the Whopper sandwich.

53:31.800 --> 53:38.520
Also known as America's favorite burger register mark.

53:38.520 --> 53:43.800
Getting fired might not be fun, but at Burger King restaurants, getting fired like the

53:43.800 --> 53:47.320
flame grill Whopper sandwich is always a good thing.

53:47.320 --> 53:53.360
We're going to burn you so bad with our hot grills.

53:53.360 --> 53:55.640
We're going someplace with this.

53:55.640 --> 54:01.360
This is why Burger King restaurants will give a free Whopper sandwich to anyone who's been

54:01.360 --> 54:06.960
fired.

54:06.960 --> 54:10.200
But there's a hook.

54:10.200 --> 54:14.920
You must publicly confess to getting canned on LinkedIn.

54:14.920 --> 54:15.920
That's right.

54:15.920 --> 54:16.920
What?

54:16.920 --> 54:17.920
Own your fire.

54:17.920 --> 54:18.920
No.

54:18.920 --> 54:19.920
It says that.

54:19.920 --> 54:20.920
Own your fire?

54:20.920 --> 54:23.200
Own your fire, peasant.

54:23.200 --> 54:25.040
Do you want a free burger?

54:25.040 --> 54:27.040
Enjoy your free burger.

54:27.040 --> 54:29.040
Ruin your career.

54:29.040 --> 54:31.040
Unemployed person.

54:31.040 --> 54:32.040
For $1.99.

54:32.040 --> 54:36.300
So here's what you do.

54:36.300 --> 54:43.020
With your life, the one that you have, you remember you have the one life, right?

54:43.020 --> 54:48.000
With your life, you go to LinkedIn and post the following public message admitting you

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
got fired.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
No.

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
There's specific wording.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
Quote.

54:52.000 --> 54:58.160
Imagine seeing this out of context like, okay, three years in PR at Triple Point, and then

54:58.160 --> 55:00.760
right below that it says, I got fired.

55:00.760 --> 55:02.320
I want a free Whopper.

55:02.320 --> 55:06.680
Hashtag Whopper severance.

55:06.680 --> 55:16.080
Wow, I can't believe the founder of Google is applying for a job here.

55:16.080 --> 55:17.080
Seems overqualified.

55:17.080 --> 55:18.760
Let's check that LinkedIn.

55:18.760 --> 55:20.400
Absolutely not.

55:20.400 --> 55:21.400
Absolutely not.

55:21.400 --> 55:23.440
Before Google, they begged for a burger.

55:23.440 --> 55:28.920
If you post that, you're going to receive a personalized link to get registered and

55:28.920 --> 55:33.960
receive a Whopper severance package in the mail, which comes with a...

55:33.960 --> 55:36.600
So here's the fucking thing, gang.

55:36.600 --> 55:41.320
You lose your job and you got some time on your hands, and what you're going to do is

55:41.320 --> 55:45.640
post about getting fired on LinkedIn because you want a free hamburger, and then Burger

55:45.640 --> 55:51.620
King sends you a link to register for a thing where eventually they'll mail you a card for

55:51.620 --> 55:57.600
a free hamburger that you will get the mail and be like, what the fuck is this?

55:57.600 --> 56:01.560
I've been gainfully employed for three years.

56:01.560 --> 56:03.000
Smash cut.

56:03.000 --> 56:06.360
Door open slowly onto suburban home.

56:06.360 --> 56:08.160
It has been said.

56:08.160 --> 56:10.760
Let Travis finish his smash cut.

56:10.760 --> 56:11.760
Smash cut.

56:11.760 --> 56:12.760
Honey, how was work?

56:12.760 --> 56:18.000
Well, I've got bad news and I've got good news.

56:18.000 --> 56:21.440
Bad news is I got fired.

56:21.440 --> 56:22.440
We've lost everything.

56:22.440 --> 56:29.720
We've lost our benefits and you know how we just bought the house.

56:29.720 --> 56:32.120
But good news.

56:32.120 --> 56:36.000
I've got dinner covered in six months.

56:36.000 --> 56:37.480
For one of us.

56:37.480 --> 56:40.680
For me, not our three triplets.

56:40.680 --> 56:41.680
It has been said.

56:41.680 --> 56:43.560
It's a very sad story.

56:43.560 --> 56:49.620
It has been said that when one door closes, another one opens.

56:49.620 --> 56:53.960
This promotion is here by the providence of God.

56:53.960 --> 56:59.240
That's my favorite end of It's a Wonderful Life.

56:59.240 --> 57:02.960
You've lost everything, George, but I brought you this coupon.

57:02.960 --> 57:08.680
In this case, it's a door to a delicious flame grilled whopper sandwich.

57:08.680 --> 57:09.680
That's cool.

57:09.680 --> 57:10.720
It's a tiny door.

57:10.720 --> 57:13.480
It's a little door to a whopper sandwich.

57:13.480 --> 57:14.480
So anyway, that's the thing.

57:14.480 --> 57:16.720
Travis, do you have a munch squad?

57:16.720 --> 57:18.880
Well, I wrote a sad lib.

57:18.880 --> 57:19.880
No, he didn't.

57:19.880 --> 57:20.880
He did.

57:20.880 --> 57:21.880
He did.

57:21.880 --> 57:22.880
He did not.

57:22.880 --> 57:23.880
I did not.

57:23.880 --> 57:24.880
I did not.

57:24.880 --> 57:27.000
Because even I don't enjoy them anymore.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
Okay.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Justin, I want to put out a formal apology.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
I'm sorry.

57:31.000 --> 57:32.000
I stepped to the throne.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
I should have known.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
No, no, no, no, no.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
It's all good.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
All right.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
Let's get lower lights on us and all the lights on them.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
All the lights that you have.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.000
Because it's our show.

57:39.000 --> 57:40.000
Oh my God.

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
Whoa.

57:41.000 --> 57:45.840
So we're going to ask your name and your question and then we're going to ask your name and

57:45.840 --> 57:46.840
your question.

57:46.840 --> 57:51.360
The only thing we can decide, we can do the most help on, we'll dig a little bit deeper

57:51.360 --> 57:52.560
into that one.

57:52.560 --> 57:55.400
It doesn't mean you lost if you don't get picked.

57:55.400 --> 57:57.400
It actually in many ways means you won.

57:57.400 --> 57:58.400
Yeah.

57:58.400 --> 58:01.560
You get to sit down, which is always a win.

58:01.560 --> 58:02.560
What is your name?

58:02.560 --> 58:03.560
Anna.

58:03.560 --> 58:04.560
Hi, Anna.

58:04.560 --> 58:05.560
What is your question?

58:05.560 --> 58:08.520
So when I first started dating my partner, he did this goof and I didn't listen to your

58:08.520 --> 58:12.360
podcast and I was really confused why he knew so much about farm life.

58:12.360 --> 58:18.580
Then during a recent Rose better best episode, I realized that farm wisdom wasn't an original

58:18.580 --> 58:24.400
goof of his, which did, he is here, but he does want me to say that he never actually

58:24.400 --> 58:25.760
claimed it was his own goof.

58:25.760 --> 58:31.240
He was just really cute and I didn't want to like ruin what we had going on and we're

58:31.240 --> 58:55.240
married now and I want to know what we should name our dog, and your name and question.

58:55.240 --> 58:56.240
My name is Lane.

58:56.240 --> 59:03.040
I'm not sure I can top that, but just talk about some shit for a while and then twist

59:03.040 --> 59:05.360
it at the very end.

59:05.360 --> 59:06.440
Lane just speak from the heart.

59:06.440 --> 59:09.160
It's not a competition.

59:09.160 --> 59:16.240
I work in a tea shop and we have free samples, a lot of free samples right at the front and

59:16.240 --> 59:19.200
I'm not always right there to like hand them out to people.

59:19.200 --> 59:24.760
So when people come up and try it, I try and casually walk towards them and tell them about

59:24.760 --> 59:27.320
what we have there and they run.

59:27.320 --> 59:28.320
Okay.

59:28.320 --> 59:34.440
They just like once, one out of every a hundred will stay, but most of them just like bolts

59:34.440 --> 59:36.440
like, Oh, just try it by.

59:36.440 --> 59:37.440
Yeah.

59:37.440 --> 59:42.040
Just came in to score some free tea and then how do I, how do I get people to stick around

59:42.040 --> 59:43.040
for your ear?

59:43.040 --> 59:48.180
Now listen, I think yours was very funny.

59:48.180 --> 59:52.040
One word answer, name it goat.

59:52.040 --> 59:54.200
A dog named goat is a very good name.

59:54.200 --> 59:55.280
It's a good name for a dog.

59:55.280 --> 59:56.280
I hope that helps.

59:56.280 --> 59:57.280
Anyway.

59:57.280 --> 59:58.280
Is it a good name for a dog?

59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.040
It's a great name for a dog.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:02.320
Goat is a fucking kick ass name for a dog.

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:07.880
This is my dog, goat.

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:10.840
And then when people ask you why you say it stands for greatest of all time.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:13.360
Can you, can you wait, wait, wait, go back to the mic.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.360
I'm not done.

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:21.080
This is, can you name it something like, and I apologize, but bear with me like dookie

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:30.720
butt and, and, and your house is going to have to burn down a little bit, but that's

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:34.360
less great, but dog saves you.

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:37.680
Newspaper has to write it up and that's awesome.

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:41.040
It's going to be in the headline.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.160
Okay.

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:48.280
So when you go to the people, do you sneak up behind them like a tea vampire and whisper

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:52.680
in their ear, like, do you like what you're tasting?

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:54.720
Like Vlad the Infuser.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:01:01.040
Are you, are you, don't, you only encourage him.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.840
It was a good one.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:09.120
Some, you're detecting some nice tannins, that one's got real good tannins.

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:10.120
What are you buying?

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.120
What are you brewing?

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:16.320
Got a lot of good teas on sale stranger.

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:23.320
When you, when you walk towards them, are you carrying like eight cups of tea?

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:24.320
Like slosh, slosh, slosh.

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.320
Come here.

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.320
Oh no, wait.

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:27.320
This is a good question.

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:32.920
Are you walking towards them or are you running towards them?

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:33.920
Usually walking.

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:37.000
Are you ever holding two knives?

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.240
To be fair, I think one knife would do it.

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.240
One knife would do it.

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.240
All right.

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:47.520
So I'm, I'm thinking about if I, if I walk into this store and tea is like one of those

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:54.320
things where you want to feel like you get it, but unless you are like a student of it,

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:57.480
you probably also understand that you have no fucking idea what you're talking.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.480
Like I enjoy tea.

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.200
I don't know fucking anything about tea.

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:03.320
So if I see somebody coming over to me and be like, let me explain to you about tea.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:11.240
I will be like, I can't, I got to go, but, but if you walk over and you say, Ooh, I see

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:15.440
you've chosen the best tea in the store.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.920
All of a sudden I'm like, Hey, I am a tea genius.

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:22.520
Oh, can I take it one step further?

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:23.520
Yeah.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.800
You have to wait outside.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:26.160
You can't come from the back.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:30.720
You have to come in from the outside and then like, like you are also a customer.

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:35.500
Be so impressed at this other customer in the wild because nothing would make me feel

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:42.600
better than someone who has no ulterior motive telling me I picked a good tea.

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:45.560
The problem is that you're sneaking up from behind them.

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:50.240
So the, what I'm going to need you to do is to hide behind the counter.

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:56.800
And then as they're getting the tea, I want you to just slowly sort of etch up.

01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:01.040
You've always been having tea, Mr. Torrance.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.040
Did that help?

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:03.040
Yes, actually.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.040
Oh, fantastic.

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:10.040
I'm realizing, I'm realizing right now that maybe our second person didn't make it down.

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.040
Hey, what's up?

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.040
What's your name?

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.040
Uh, Red.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.040
Red.

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.040
Hi Red.

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.040
What is your question?

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:18.320
Red hates Linguini or loves it.

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:21.520
My partner in crime is obsessed with the movie Ratatouille.

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:22.520
Okay.

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:23.520
Hell yes.

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:26.800
And will not stop talking about the movie Ratatouille.

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:30.340
And I'm starting to believe that she likes Ratatouille more than me.

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:34.440
How can I get her attention back from the dirty rat people?

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:43.040
That is the most fuckwild thing to be jealous of, I feel like.

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.040
All right.

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:47.480
And your question, your name and question.

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:48.480
I'm Adrian.

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:49.480
Hi Adrian.

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:53.800
And this has been something that's been plaguing me for about two years now.

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:58.640
About two years ago, I realized on my iPhone, there was a downloaded version of Who Let

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:04.600
the Dogs Out, but it was a karaoke version.

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:08.480
I didn't download it and my only, the only other person who shares my iTunes account,

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:11.240
my mom also has no idea how the hell it got there.

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:12.240
She says.

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:13.240
Yeah.

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:20.800
She doesn't know the password still, so I know it wasn't, um, and caveat, I can't get

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:21.800
it off my iPhone.

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:22.800
Wait.

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:28.400
I've, I've now transferred it to two different iPhones throughout the two years and it won't

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:29.400
go away.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:30.400
Delete it.

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.400
No.

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:32.400
I've deleted it.

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:33.400
It won't.

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:34.400
It's the mask.

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:35.400
All right.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:36.400
Okay.

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:40.840
Wait, wait, wait, because I don't know which one we're going to do, but I do want to say

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:41.840
this.

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:42.840
Have you taken it to like a genius bar?

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:43.840
I'm like.

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:44.840
No, no.

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:45.840
Stop.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:46.840
You've killed it.

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:48.560
Uh, I think.

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:51.880
I do have the audio evidence if you need to hear it as well.

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:53.600
Oh yeah.

01:04:53.600 --> 01:05:00.520
I mean, obviously, uh, I feel like ratatouille is not going to hurt you.

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:03.640
You need to get on board with ratatouille, share the love with, share the love with your

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:04.640
partner.

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:08.200
It's a wonderful cartoon mouse and all it wants to do is cook and a kitchen and make

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.200
a kitchen.

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:10.200
And the music is amazing.

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:11.200
Music's amazing.

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:15.720
And it's a beautiful film about the triumph of the rat spirit, the voice acting, the

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:16.720
animation.

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:17.720
It's a wonderful film.

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:18.720
Everything's great about it.

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:19.720
You have nothing to be afraid of.

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:24.520
Unless, no, there's no unless you're super good.

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:25.520
I promise.

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:26.520
All right.

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:27.520
Thank you.

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:28.520
Thank you.

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:29.520
Right.

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:30.520
Here it is.

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:31.520
Yes, please.

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:32.520
Bump that shit.

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:33.520
Full volume.

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:34.520
That just sounds like the song.

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:35.520
Everyone be quiet.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.520
Be quiet.

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:52.040
Now we're just listening to who let the dogs out.

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:53.040
It sounds like that.

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:54.040
It's actually us.

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:55.040
It's actually me and Travis doing it.

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:56.040
Someone shouted.

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:57.040
Who let the dogs out?

01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.040
Who?

01:05:58.040 --> 01:05:59.040
Who?

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.040
Who?

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.040
Who?

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.040
Who?

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.040
Who?

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:04.040
Who?

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:05.040
Who?

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:06.040
Who?

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.040
Who?

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.040
Who?

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.040
Who?

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:10.040
Okay.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:11.040
Okay.

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:12.040
It's a fucking fun tune, though.

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:13.040
Listen.

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:14.040
All right.

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:15.040
Listen.

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.040
Can I?

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:17.040
No.

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.040
I'm sorry, Griffin.

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.040
I'm sorry.

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.040
We can all shit on who let the dogs out.

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:21.400
But we all love it.

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:25.840
You have got on your phone basically a party starter.

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:31.560
Any awkward situation that you're in, if you just slowly start turning up the volume and

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:36.080
people are like, is that the fucking Baja men?

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:38.320
I have to ask a question.

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:39.400
If you don't want to answer it, it's fine.

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:42.280
But do you like to party?

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:43.280
Do you like to party?

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:44.280
Hard.

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:45.280
Okay.

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:53.680
Then you said that the two people who have access to your iTunes account is your mom

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:57.080
and you, Adrian.

01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:02.760
And there's a third person that has access to it, and it might be drunk Adrian because

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:14.000
Adrian not only downloaded it, she flipped a special switch that she knows about can

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
never delete.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:20.320
Do not let sober Adrian delete permanent passcode.

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:23.120
I mean, you know the culprit now, but there is it's beyond.

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:24.760
She's a way better hacker.

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.620
There's just nothing you can do about it.

01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:27.620
Does that help?

01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:28.620
Yeah.

01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:29.620
Great.

01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:30.620
Fantastic.

01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:31.620
Thank you very much.

01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:32.620
Okay.

01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:33.620
One last question.

01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:34.620
No.

01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:35.620
We've already got you picked.

01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:36.620
Yes.

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:37.620
You've got it.

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:38.620
Hello.

01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:39.620
My name is Morgan.

01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:40.620
Hi, Morgan.

01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:41.960
What is your question, Morgan?

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:50.020
So back in June, my sister went on her honeymoon with her now husband to Las Vegas.

01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:54.880
She comes back and she hands me a key chain with my name on it and a picture frame from

01:07:54.880 --> 01:08:00.480
Las Vegas of like all the cool shit and a picture of her and her husband.

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:03.200
And I told her like, oh man, thanks.

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:04.200
This is great.

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:12.320
But I'm kind of feel bad because I'm actually lying to her, so how can I, how can I layer

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:17.400
down easy that this was actually the worst gift I've ever received?

01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:18.400
Okay.

01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:19.400
That's savage, Morgan.

01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:23.320
Morgan, it sounds like you maybe don't even want an advice.

01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:28.520
You just wanted the most public way to drag your sister.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:29.520
I'm sorry.

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:30.520
We've been missing.

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:31.520
Jorgen.

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.520
I have no idea what this is.

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:33.520
Great.

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:34.520
Now you've dragged us.

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:39.000
We're getting more and more popular by the day.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Okay.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Thank you.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
And what is your name?

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
My name is Eli.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Hi, Eli.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
What is your question?

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
So I'm transgender.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.120
I identify as a trans man and I've only been using the men's.

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:50.120
Thank you.

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:51.120
All right.

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:58.440
And I've only been using the men's room for about three years and the only thing I know

01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:02.320
about using the men's room is that we're supposed to make a like super aggressive,

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:03.320
no eye contact.

01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:04.320
Yeah.

01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:05.320
Yeah.

01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:06.320
Yeah.

01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:07.320
I like the way you phrase.

01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:20.800
I was like, and so I'm just wondering if there's anything else that I don't know I'm supposed

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:30.320
to be doing in the men's room.

01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:31.320
Morgan, thank you so much.

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:35.400
Morgan, I think just only buy your sister airport gifts because I think that's the level

01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:36.400
you all are on right now.

01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:40.880
Also, put it away until your sister and her husband come over.

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:41.880
That's how adults do it.

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:44.360
How do you display a key chain?

01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:45.360
Okay.

01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:46.360
Good point.

01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:47.360
Does that?

01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.360
Thank you, Morgan.

01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:49.360
Thank you.

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:51.240
Thank you.

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:55.360
Some things you need to do in the bathroom, run water and make it sound like you're washing

01:09:55.360 --> 01:10:00.360
your hands.

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:07.400
Jesus.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:11.680
One thing I like to do is not wash my hands and then as I'm leaving, say, I never touched

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:12.680
it.

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:17.640
He literally did this because I did this today at dinner.

01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:19.640
He said, I didn't touch it and left.

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:21.440
I didn't touch it.

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:22.440
Why should I wash my hands?

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:23.440
I didn't touch it.

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:24.440
It was really cool.

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:27.080
Oh, this works a lot.

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:34.800
Wash your hands, look up in the mirror and just go, and then walk out the door.

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:39.920
That will always play because even if you're a complete stranger to the person next to

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:44.480
you, they'll just think, yeah.

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:50.200
One of the big good ones that they never tell you about in any of the books is you should

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:54.560
try to start unbuttoning your pants as you walk through the door.

01:10:54.560 --> 01:11:01.360
So that way you're getting ready.

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:02.360
Did we help?

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:03.360
Does that help?

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:04.360
Definitely.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:05.360
Yes.

And honest to God, we've been in a lot of theater and they're all really, really great.

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:28.400
This one has a free Golden Tee golf machine upstairs, which we are fucking terrible at.

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:34.960

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.520
Kind of.

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:51.520

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:02.360
Yes.

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:03.360
Because we have early fucking flights.

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:06.920
Because Justin has a fever, Griffin fell over, and I arm wrestled too much.

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:09.480

Thank you.

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:33.660
I'm Jesse. I'm Jordan. And we've been doing Jordan Jesse Go! for almost ten years now.

01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:38.020
And it's not gotten any easier to describe. So we asked our fans to do it for us.

01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:44.140
Jordan Jesse Go! is a weekly conversation with two best pals, two hilarious friends,

01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:49.180
the hilarious smart kids, talking about hilarious stuff that happens to them, mostly really stupid

01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:54.860
stuff, awkward anecdotes, insane tangents, heartfelt stuff. It's like being thrown in

01:14:54.860 --> 01:14:59.200
the middle of a hilarious conversation between you and your best pal. It's a show that makes

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:03.520
me laugh every week, which is pretty rare and wonderful. It might be the best thing on the

01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:07.960
internet. One of the funniest things you will hear. And it's the best part of my week. And

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:13.400
has kept me company for the past seven years through all sorts of life. I love those guys.

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:18.720
That's Jordan Jesse Go! the comedy podcast that's been named Best of iTunes. Every

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:25.900
