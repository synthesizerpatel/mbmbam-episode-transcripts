00:00.000 --> 00:03.300
Hi folks, I'm your middle-est brother Travis McRoy.

00:03.300 --> 00:05.400
I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McRoy.

00:05.400 --> 00:07.440
This is weird and I don't like this.

00:07.440 --> 00:08.560
It's weird, right?

00:08.560 --> 00:09.400
Yeah.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.420
It's like when you, it's like a flat tire.

00:11.420 --> 00:13.560
You can feel that something's just off

00:13.560 --> 00:15.000
and it's that Justin's not here.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.480
He's on a boat, he's on a cruise.

00:18.480 --> 00:21.160
He said we weren't allowed to go.

00:21.160 --> 00:22.160
Yeah, that was weird.

00:22.160 --> 00:23.000
It was weird.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.240
He said that only one of us could be at the ocean.

00:25.240 --> 00:28.040
He said it was something about maritime law.

00:28.040 --> 00:29.160
Yeah, well it's kind of like that

00:29.160 --> 00:31.160
Kiefer Sutherland show Designated Survivor

00:31.160 --> 00:33.760
and that if there is, God forbid,

00:33.760 --> 00:36.800
but if there is a, you know,

00:36.800 --> 00:41.440
that movie with the Poseidon adventure sort of situation,

00:41.440 --> 00:43.600
well you and I can carry the torch

00:43.600 --> 00:45.480
if there is a Poseidon adventure situation.

00:45.480 --> 00:46.720
Just quick sidetrack.

00:46.720 --> 00:49.360
I think it would be great if on Designated Survivor

00:49.360 --> 00:54.360
every like season ender and then season starter

00:54.800 --> 00:56.120
was like at the end of the season,

00:56.120 --> 00:58.520
it was like good news Kiefer,

00:58.520 --> 00:59.920
we found a new president.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.560
You don't have to be president anymore.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.400
And then something happens

01:03.400 --> 01:05.760
that he has to be president again every year.

01:05.760 --> 01:06.600
Okay.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.400
And hopefully it goes like 12 seasons.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.640
Yeah, so like the Secretary of Agriculture

01:10.640 --> 01:14.120
like flies back from an extended trip in Dubai

01:14.120 --> 01:16.520
and is like, what's up motherfucker?

01:16.520 --> 01:17.360
I'm back.

01:17.360 --> 01:18.800
Bet you thought I was in the room

01:18.800 --> 01:21.480
when the big boom happened, but no, no, no.

01:21.480 --> 01:23.720
Anyway, give me that president badge.

01:23.720 --> 01:25.160
And he's like, oh, thank goodness.

01:25.160 --> 01:27.040
I didn't want to be president.

01:27.040 --> 01:29.880
But then he falls in a toilet and dies.

01:29.880 --> 01:30.880
Anyways, so.

01:30.880 --> 01:32.720
Anyway, so that's Travis and my spec script

01:32.720 --> 01:35.680
for Designated Survivor season two premiere.

01:35.680 --> 01:36.520
Very excited about it.

01:36.520 --> 01:37.800
So Justin's not here.

01:37.800 --> 01:41.960
So in lieu of his being,

01:41.960 --> 01:43.920
we are putting up the Candle Nights episode

01:43.920 --> 01:47.040
from last year, which we recorded as part of the TV show.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.640
If you have watched our TV show, which you should,

01:49.640 --> 01:51.680
I think it's pretty fun.

01:51.680 --> 01:53.560
You'll recognize some of the stuff

01:53.560 --> 01:55.120
because it is what we filmed.

01:55.120 --> 01:56.240
It was our last day of filming.

01:56.240 --> 01:58.160
We're all extremely tired.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.640
I think it's fair to say, very emotional.

02:01.880 --> 02:03.200
And so yeah.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.800
Something to keep in mind.

02:04.800 --> 02:06.280
One, it's a live show.

02:06.280 --> 02:10.960
Two, we're recording it in the auditorium at City Hall.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.760
So it's not like we were, you know,

02:12.760 --> 02:14.600
it's not a state of the art recording.

02:14.600 --> 02:15.440
The audio's not good.

02:15.440 --> 02:16.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:16.280 --> 02:17.120
The audio, it's listenable

02:17.120 --> 02:18.040
and you can hear what we're saying,

02:18.040 --> 02:21.200
but that auditorium was invented,

02:21.200 --> 02:24.640
it was built before amplified sound was invented.

02:24.640 --> 02:27.000
And so there's a bit of a trade-off

02:27.000 --> 02:28.600
and I apologize for that,

02:28.600 --> 02:30.520
but I think it's a really fun episode

02:30.520 --> 02:33.000
and I think you'll like it regardless.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.720
Some other thing, I just edited the episode

02:35.720 --> 02:37.040
and Travis, unfortunately,

02:37.040 --> 02:40.400
I did cut the celebrity miracle bit

02:40.400 --> 02:42.800
because that part was un-listenable

02:42.800 --> 02:43.640
because you couldn't hear it at all,

02:43.640 --> 02:44.480
which is a bummer.

02:44.480 --> 02:46.160
And that's also, that's for the TV show.

02:46.160 --> 02:47.560
That's fine, I understand.

02:47.560 --> 02:49.360
Travis got a surprise celebrity guest

02:49.360 --> 02:51.240
and it's on a TV show,

02:51.240 --> 02:55.000
but unfortunately just like it's not listenable at all.

02:56.080 --> 02:57.960
And what else?

02:57.960 --> 03:00.160
I think that's all the sort of caveats.

03:00.160 --> 03:01.920
We're gonna start out with our dad just hamming it up.

03:01.920 --> 03:02.820
What else is new?

03:03.720 --> 03:05.480
But yeah, we realized this is weird

03:05.480 --> 03:09.560
that we are publishing one of our holiday specials

03:09.560 --> 03:12.520
that we recorded in a non-holiday September

03:12.520 --> 03:15.200
and publishing in a definitely non-holiday March,

03:15.200 --> 03:16.680
but that's just how we do things.

03:16.680 --> 03:19.600
I mean, it's the traditional candle lights in March.

03:19.600 --> 03:20.440
You know what I mean?

03:20.440 --> 03:21.480
Yeah.

03:21.480 --> 03:23.600
So yeah, thanks for listening.

03:23.600 --> 03:24.440
Enjoy the episode.

03:24.440 --> 03:27.200
We'll be back in a bit for the Midi-Zone, so see you soon.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.040
Christmas.

03:32.640 --> 03:34.920
Yeah, it's bad enough.

03:34.920 --> 03:38.000
They got the Sheets thing, they got the Schmanners thing,

03:38.000 --> 03:40.400
they got the Sawbones thing, they got the Buffering thing.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.240
Apparently no room for the Adventure Zone,

03:42.240 --> 03:43.780
but that's okay.

03:43.780 --> 03:44.940
No, no, no.

03:45.840 --> 03:48.280
Thank you for acting like you know what that is.

03:48.280 --> 03:52.120
Hi, I'm Clint McElroy.

03:52.120 --> 03:56.240
I am, some of the people up here

03:56.240 --> 03:58.400
that you have seen on this stage this evening

03:58.400 --> 04:03.400
are my fault so far, so I take full credit there.

04:03.880 --> 04:07.900
But I serve a very important duty tonight.

04:09.000 --> 04:09.840
For what?

04:12.480 --> 04:15.160
Are you laughing because I said duty?

04:15.160 --> 04:16.000
Yeah.

04:17.560 --> 04:20.960
This is a prime bim-bam crowd.

04:24.120 --> 04:27.800
No, seriously though, I'm here for a very important purpose.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.740
The producers and the director and the crew told me

04:30.740 --> 04:33.540
that if I shoehorned myself into this TV show one more time,

04:33.540 --> 04:37.860
I'd qualify for an Emmy, so here I am.

04:37.860 --> 04:41.220
No, but seriously, on a serious note,

04:41.220 --> 04:43.440
Candle Nights is important to all of us,

04:43.440 --> 04:45.600
and I think you'd probably agree with me

04:45.600 --> 04:47.480
if you weren't all hammered.

04:47.480 --> 04:50.840
But a very important component

04:50.840 --> 04:52.620
of every Candle Nights observation

04:52.620 --> 04:56.280
is our Candle Nights carolers.

04:56.280 --> 04:57.800
Here's the problem.

04:57.800 --> 04:59.160
We've run a little over,

04:59.160 --> 05:03.040
and they have to do a tree lighting in Guyandot

05:03.040 --> 05:04.880
in just a few minutes.

05:04.880 --> 05:07.900
So, and those three people came from Australia.

05:07.900 --> 05:09.520
I'll tell you the Guyandot joke later.

05:09.520 --> 05:10.880
That's why nobody laughed at it.

05:10.880 --> 05:14.080
But they prepared all these songs,

05:14.080 --> 05:15.920
there's just not enough time.

05:15.920 --> 05:19.640
So, they're going to do a very unique rendition

05:19.640 --> 05:22.240
of four different Christmas songs.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.500
Ladies and gentlemen, enjoy tonight

05:24.500 --> 05:28.480
and welcome our Candle Light, Candle Night,

05:28.480 --> 05:31.200
knew I was gonna do that, carolers!
