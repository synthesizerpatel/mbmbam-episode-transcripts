00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:48.960
Hello everybody, welcome, my brother, my brother and me, Super Bowl Watch 2015. I'm your oldest

00:48.960 --> 00:56.080
brother, Justin McElroy. Bum bum bum, bum bum bum. I'm Travis McElroy. And I'm Papa John's Manning.

00:56.080 --> 01:05.520
That's he's fused with. He has become one. He has been absorbed by the pizza chain known as Papa

01:05.520 --> 01:11.680
John's, and he is one with them. All is right with the world. I'm Papa John's Manning. You know,

01:11.680 --> 01:16.560
a lot of people say they only want Super Bowl's coming up next Sunday before our next episode

01:16.560 --> 01:23.840
comes out. So we just wanted to open the door a little bit for the sports enthusiasts to finally

01:23.840 --> 01:34.640
find a place where we can really talk ball. And puck? Well, big game is coming up

01:34.640 --> 01:39.760
Sunday. A lot of people say they only watch it for the ads. You know what I watch it for? What?

01:40.640 --> 01:48.400
The cheerleaders. Hello. It's a sport, Griffin. They don't even have those anymore. That's my

01:48.400 --> 01:55.520
engine. When was the last time you watched a football game and saw cheerleaders? They don't,

01:55.520 --> 01:59.200
I don't think they have them anymore. The last one I watched was that Patriots game where they

01:59.200 --> 02:07.600
had deflated the cheerleaders. They didn't perform as well. Just sort of warbling around on the

02:07.600 --> 02:12.240
sidelines. Didn't really get anybody, especially psych, but that did not stop the Patriots from

02:12.240 --> 02:17.840
coming away with a big decisive victory over the Indiana Colts. It did make me wonder what they

02:17.840 --> 02:21.360
thought the end game of that would be. Like maybe if we a little bit, a little bit of the blood out

02:21.360 --> 02:25.440
of our cheerleaders, they'll be better. I don't know. I'm really looking forward to the big game.

02:26.080 --> 02:29.600
Are you looking for the big game? Who's in it this year? A lot of people are still wondering.

02:32.000 --> 02:37.520
Well, we have to wait and see who shows up. Well, I think that's part of it. Cause you default if

02:37.520 --> 02:42.080
you don't get there in time and with traffic these days. Oh my God. Where is that movie?

02:42.720 --> 02:47.520
What about trying to get to the Super Bowl? Yeah. Like they all oversleep in new

02:47.520 --> 02:51.920
England and they have to like get to Denver or wherever they're doing the Super Bowl this year.

02:51.920 --> 02:56.400
But then they forget Kevin at home. Yeah. Oh my God. We forgot Tom Brady.

02:56.400 --> 02:59.200
And it just shows him like in his underwear sliding around the house.

03:00.560 --> 03:06.880
That's his aftershave bit. Him and Giselle have to fight off Joe Pesci. None of this is good so far.

03:06.880 --> 03:12.800
This is all very bad. You said everything we've done ever is funny. And the streak ends today.

03:12.800 --> 03:19.280
Why won't people sit next to me on the bus?

03:20.720 --> 03:26.480
Every morning on my way to work, I'm one of the first to get on the bus. As the bus fills up,

03:26.480 --> 03:31.760
I end up being the last person sitting alone. People will often opt to stand before sitting

03:31.760 --> 03:38.080
next to me. I'm very quiet, fairly well dressed, average looking guy who showers every morning.

03:38.080 --> 03:42.720
Help me brothers. Am I just being paranoid or is there a method to being the cool guy on the bus?

03:42.720 --> 03:46.480
Everyone wants to sit next to you. That's from potentially creepy bus guy in Seattle.

03:46.480 --> 03:52.320
I totally get this and I know what it is. Oh, okay. Well, good. Just sort of putting your

03:52.320 --> 03:57.040
foot down, huh? But just sort of putting the Travis stamp on this one. Claiming it for your own.

03:57.040 --> 04:03.040
You want it too bad. That might be it. Yeah. I mean, I've been that dude where it's that

04:03.040 --> 04:06.160
idea of like- Do you do that thing where you like raise your eyebrows and pat the seat like?

04:08.640 --> 04:12.080
Well, it's like somebody starts to walk up and you kind of like subconsciously like

04:12.080 --> 04:16.800
adjust yourself, like preparing to make a new friend. And it's like, I want to look the most

04:16.800 --> 04:21.040
normal now. And it's like, Oh, what's that guy wiggling about? I don't want to sit next to the

04:21.040 --> 04:29.440
wiggly dude. Are you maybe whenever anybody walks by, you maybe go seats taken. Just like a nervous

04:29.440 --> 04:38.400
tick. Yeah. Can't sit here. If you forgot to mention that bit, that is some primo, primo

04:38.400 --> 04:44.000
background that we definitely, definitely needed. I honestly, I think that a part of it is in this

04:44.000 --> 04:52.000
day and age being a perfectly normal, like average looking dude is for some reason become like a huge

04:52.000 --> 04:55.760
red flag. Well, yeah, because those are the hate crimers. Those are the people who like fuck up

04:55.760 --> 05:01.520
the worst. It's never our profiling has been flipped on its ear because the people who want

05:01.520 --> 05:06.720
to do heinous shit know they're going to get away with it if they put on some fucking H&M.

05:06.720 --> 05:12.320
Like I've watched so much CSI and shit, and it's always like the normal looking dude. That's like

05:12.320 --> 05:17.760
the serial killer. It's never the big bearded tattooed biker guy. He's the guy who volunteers

05:17.760 --> 05:21.840
his time on the weekends at like the big brother's big sister's house, you know, whatever. And it's

05:21.840 --> 05:27.600
like, okay, he's actually a good guy who just lives his life every day. And he's just made some

05:27.600 --> 05:32.960
interesting like, you know, outfit choices today. It's the normal looking dude who puts people in

05:32.960 --> 05:40.320
freezers. Are people just too polite? Like for me, if I'm on a bus or like an airport shuttle,

05:40.320 --> 05:48.480
maybe, you know, from one terminal to the next, if there's an open seat and the only one is like

05:48.480 --> 05:54.320
next to people, I will probably stand. I will probably go ahead and stand. I don't want to be

05:54.320 --> 06:00.800
the guy that ruined somebody's day by touching them, cramming in next to them. You don't want

06:00.800 --> 06:07.840
to make that human connection, that most blissful human experience of sweet, soft human touch.

06:07.840 --> 06:12.000
I'm also, if it's like the last seat, I'm also very nervous that somewhere on there,

06:12.000 --> 06:16.240
there's a pregnant woman that I just haven't spotted and somebody-

06:16.240 --> 06:17.600
And you'll accidentally sit on her?

06:18.560 --> 06:24.560
No, like she's standing. People are looking at me like, look at, look at, look at-

06:24.560 --> 06:30.240
Justin's not suggesting that, honey, I shrunk you and you're pregnant is a thing.

06:30.240 --> 06:31.360
No, I'm saying-

06:31.360 --> 06:32.560
She could also be invisible.

06:33.360 --> 06:36.960
Yeah, invisible pregnant women on buses are getting to be a pretty serious issue.

06:36.960 --> 06:38.240
Hey, Obama.

06:38.240 --> 06:42.480
And the third trimester, ladies just turn invisible. I don't get it.

06:43.120 --> 06:47.120
It's a one in a hundred kind of chance, but as a side effect of pregnancy, invisibility-

06:47.120 --> 06:49.520
Sorry, a one in a hundred?

06:49.520 --> 06:53.520
Yep. It's becoming more and more prevalent as we put GMOs into more stuff.

06:53.520 --> 06:56.960
Ugh, GMOs turning all our pregnant women invisible. Cut it out, GMOs.

06:56.960 --> 07:01.360
GMO, you've done it again.

07:02.560 --> 07:04.880
Smooched another tiny, invisible pregnant woman.

07:06.240 --> 07:09.840
Is GMO the tiny alien from the Flintstones?

07:09.840 --> 07:10.720
Yes, I have-

07:10.720 --> 07:15.280
Hey, GMO, I've come to turn all your pregnant women invisible.

07:15.280 --> 07:15.780
GMO!

07:18.080 --> 07:20.240
Can I ask why this is bothering you?

07:20.240 --> 07:25.040
Wilma, why are you, why are you invisible, Wilma? What haven't you told me?

07:25.040 --> 07:30.240
Well, Fred, this is what I sound like on the cartoon, I think.

07:30.880 --> 07:34.880
I'm pregnant, I didn't know how to tell you, but now that I'm invisible, I guess you guessed it.

07:36.640 --> 07:42.080
Can I ask why this is a problem for you? Why this is bothering you that you're not-

07:42.080 --> 07:44.800
I mean, I get it. I love that sweet, blissful,

07:46.240 --> 07:50.080
celestial human interaction of a soft thigh-to-thigh touch.

07:50.080 --> 07:55.600
I'm real into that through the jeans stuff, but that might not be everybody's cup of tea.

07:56.720 --> 08:00.240
It seems like it wouldn't bother Justin if people didn't sit next to you on a bus.

08:00.240 --> 08:02.720
That actually seems like it would be kind of a superpower for you.

08:03.920 --> 08:07.760
I bet it's like this, Gervin. I bet it's like the first time it happened, he was like,

08:07.760 --> 08:11.040
ah, awesome, great, see it all to myself. The second time he was like,

08:11.040 --> 08:15.600
what are the odds? Twice in a row. And then by like the 32nd time, he was like,

08:15.600 --> 08:18.320
do I smell? Like, what is the thing? What's going on?

08:18.320 --> 08:23.040
This is honestly more of a concern to me on like a plane.

08:23.040 --> 08:29.760
I used to fly a lot more before we had the kiddo, and I can remember very clearly being like

08:29.760 --> 08:35.280
in the middle seat of a plane and not having anyone on the left.

08:35.280 --> 08:39.600
And the plane, they're doing that thing where it's like, I don't see any more people coming on.

08:39.600 --> 08:43.280
Oh my God. And I'm already like planning how I'm gonna stretch out.

08:43.280 --> 08:46.960
Like how quick I'm gonna get that armrest up and put my bag underneath there

08:46.960 --> 08:52.160
and put my Diet Mountain Dew inside the thing and take his SkyMall and keep that one.

08:52.160 --> 08:55.520
Build a friend out of magazines and sit in the chair next to you,

08:56.160 --> 09:00.000
turn to him and say, oh my God, are you watching this movie? Maze Runner's amazing.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.320
Tell him that my wife is in the bathroom and or pregnant and invisible

09:04.320 --> 09:07.280
and go ahead and just leave her meal there. And or made of magazines.

09:09.600 --> 09:14.800
And I've got all these great plans. And then just Johnny come latest,

09:14.800 --> 09:18.800
then just strolling up the aisle. Oh, I think this is, yeah, I bet it is.

09:18.800 --> 09:22.880
I bet that is your seat there. Go ahead. And it's always,

09:22.880 --> 09:29.040
the only thing worse than that, the stinkiest salad in the entire Aeropuerto.

09:29.040 --> 09:33.120
Like the stinkiest. He went to every restaurant, smelled the salads.

09:33.120 --> 09:36.320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Too fresh. Too fresh smelling.

09:36.320 --> 09:37.520
Do you have any with garbage?

09:38.800 --> 09:41.600
Do you have any from like a week ago that you forgot to refrigerate?

09:41.600 --> 09:46.640
Do you have any from a week ago that have Vienna sausages toasted into croutons?

09:46.640 --> 09:48.960
Could you put that on here? That would be great.

09:51.120 --> 09:56.080
The worst moment to me on a plane is when you walk on and someone is like sitting in your seat.

09:56.080 --> 10:00.800
And like that, that confrontation to me is like a Sisyphusian level of like,

10:02.160 --> 10:08.320
hey, you see I'm actually. So, and there's like a line of people waiting to sit down behind you.

10:08.320 --> 10:12.640
I don't know why that moment makes me so awkward, but it like, cause it's my seat.

10:12.640 --> 10:16.080
I fucking paid for it. It's not like I'm trying to steal it from him.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.800
And, but like the three times I've had to do that in my life,

10:18.800 --> 10:23.040
the person responded like I was taking the cherriest seat.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.320
What did you want me to do?

10:24.320 --> 10:25.840
Why can't I just steal it?

10:28.560 --> 10:32.160
Not to turn this into Seinfeld, the podcast, but the other thing about airplane.

10:32.160 --> 10:33.680
Oh Jesus Christ.

10:33.680 --> 10:38.560
When you have to put your bag, like 10 rolls back because it's the only one.

10:38.560 --> 10:40.320
And then there are people still getting on the plane.

10:40.320 --> 10:43.360
So you have to be that guy who's like fighting against the tide.

10:43.360 --> 10:46.800
Like, yes, this is what we're doing now. Crowd surf me back to my seat.

10:46.800 --> 10:49.040
You get a lot of that through the jeans interaction.

10:50.480 --> 10:51.600
Yeah. We're not talking about it.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.600
Can we actually do just a quick PSA?

10:53.600 --> 10:55.200
Cause I feel like this is a hot topic right now.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.600
And I feel like we need to maybe make our opinion clear on it.

10:59.760 --> 11:03.360
I feel like the hot topic right now that everybody's talking about is like,

11:03.360 --> 11:05.760
dude, dude, spread, spreading their legs.

11:05.760 --> 11:08.080
Just sort of get man. Is that what it is?

11:09.120 --> 11:11.680
Is that the, is that the scientific term is manspread?

11:11.680 --> 11:12.320
That's correct.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.400
Let's talk about manspread.

11:14.400 --> 11:15.600
Keep it together.

11:15.600 --> 11:16.800
Keep them closed.

11:16.800 --> 11:20.880
I just got back from Pac South, San Antonio, where I covered several panels

11:20.880 --> 11:24.640
where I was sitting in the middle of like a row between two dudes

11:24.640 --> 11:29.680
that I just wanted to bust out like a courtesy protractor and like shove it between their junk

11:29.680 --> 11:31.920
and just showed them how bad they were fucking up.

11:31.920 --> 11:37.120
Just show them. I would do, I would have two protractors, one for my own ruined,

11:37.920 --> 11:45.200
flattened peniness and their, their, their giant greater than sign that they had going on

11:45.200 --> 11:48.400
in their pants and just show them how bad they were fucking up.

11:48.400 --> 11:52.880
Just like do a quick measurement of how much percentile of my own cushion

11:53.440 --> 11:57.200
they were occupying with their, with their, their meat.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.720
I, Oh God.

11:58.720 --> 12:03.360
If somebody does that, you just have to cross your legs so that your foot is resting on their leg.

12:03.360 --> 12:05.920
And if they look at you, just eyeball them real hard.

12:05.920 --> 12:09.120
I sat next to one who was like doing it so heinously that I couldn't,

12:09.120 --> 12:11.280
I had like my laptop in my lap cause I was like taking notes.

12:11.280 --> 12:12.160
I was covering the panel.

12:12.160 --> 12:16.720
I had one dude that was like so heinous about it that I had to like sit off the corner of my chair

12:16.720 --> 12:18.000
and it was like an hour long.

12:18.000 --> 12:18.960
It was like really uncomfortable.

12:18.960 --> 12:22.320
So after a while I just like fucking like cuddled with this guy.

12:22.320 --> 12:24.080
Just like fucking like, nope.

12:24.080 --> 12:28.640
Okay. I guess I have to fight for my right to like be here right now.

12:28.640 --> 12:31.840
And I know that's not an equitable solution for everybody, especially when it's shorts weather,

12:31.840 --> 12:36.800
but just like, Oh guys, just be constantly vigilant and alert about how you're,

12:38.080 --> 12:40.000
how you're, how you're sort of occupying stuff.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.800
If the person next to you is employee man spread,

12:42.800 --> 12:46.640
it just start rubbing their jeans and ask them if they have a mint or some gum.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.040
And then after they say no, keep asking.

12:49.840 --> 12:54.800
If their jeans pocket has a mint in it and that pocket is on your cushion,

12:54.800 --> 12:56.160
that it's your mint.

12:56.160 --> 12:56.800
It's your shit.

12:56.800 --> 12:57.920
Check the constitution.

12:57.920 --> 12:59.600
Manifest destiny, baby.

12:59.600 --> 13:00.400
Give me that mint.

13:00.400 --> 13:01.520
Manifest destiny.

13:01.520 --> 13:02.240
Give me that pocket.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.520
Manifest destiny.

13:03.520 --> 13:04.800
Oh, that was it.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.920
I think manifest is actually better, Travis.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.200
How about a Yahoo answer?

13:09.760 --> 13:11.200
I wish I'd said mine first.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.160
How about a Yahoo?

13:12.160 --> 13:13.440
We'll fix it in post.

13:13.440 --> 13:15.360
How about, that's not how post works.

13:15.360 --> 13:16.160
How about a Yahoo?

13:18.080 --> 13:18.480
Yeah.

13:18.480 --> 13:20.080
Can you put one in in post?

13:20.080 --> 13:20.320
Yeah.

13:20.320 --> 13:21.760
I'll put this Yahoo in, in post.

13:21.760 --> 13:22.240
All right guys.

13:22.240 --> 13:23.360
So that was a great question.

13:23.360 --> 13:24.960
Justin, time to move on to the next one.

13:25.600 --> 13:26.880
This Yahoo was sent in by-

13:26.880 --> 13:28.800
You just put some jokes in there?

13:28.800 --> 13:31.360
By a game recognized game, Rachel Sperling.

13:31.360 --> 13:31.600
Thank you.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.040
It's by Yahoo answers user, Rob.

13:34.320 --> 13:39.040
Who asks, which celebrity would you like, sorry.

13:39.040 --> 13:41.680
Which celebrity would you like to stroke your hair

13:41.680 --> 13:42.560
if you were dying?

13:43.280 --> 13:45.920
You are lying on your, you are lying on your death bed

13:45.920 --> 13:48.000
and are about to merge with the infinite.

13:48.720 --> 13:52.000
You can summon any celebrity, living or dead,

13:52.000 --> 13:54.880
to stoke you hair as you fade away.

13:54.880 --> 13:57.200
Who would it be? Harvey Fierstein.

13:57.200 --> 13:57.760
Oh, sorry.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.040
That's not in there, but just like,

13:59.040 --> 14:00.640
I just got so excited about my answer,

14:00.640 --> 14:02.160
but of course it'd be Harvey Fierstein.

14:03.360 --> 14:06.480
Griffin, Griffin, you're dying.

14:08.240 --> 14:11.840
Going to be with Jesus, gonna be with Jesus soon.

14:12.640 --> 14:17.120
Against all odds, Harvey Fierstein has outlived you.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.600
I'll carry on your legacy.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.280
I'll tell the tales of your bravery.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.520
Oh wait, Griffin, I'm dying too.

14:25.520 --> 14:28.160
Can you stroke my hair, Griffin?

14:28.160 --> 14:29.440
We'll do like a yin yang of stroking.

14:29.440 --> 14:33.040
We'll do a hair stroking dying 69, Griffin.

14:34.400 --> 14:38.160
You actually sound like the female frog woman

14:38.160 --> 14:39.680
from Rocko's Modern Life.

14:40.400 --> 14:43.120
Thank you for jumping in the path of that bullet for me.

14:43.120 --> 14:45.760
That muggers assailant was coming for me

14:45.760 --> 14:46.880
and you saved my life.

14:46.880 --> 14:48.240
You're a hero, Griffin.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.160
Oh fuck, that would be good.

14:50.160 --> 14:52.080
You're the greatest man I've ever met.

14:52.080 --> 14:53.040
I'll never forget you.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.720
It'll be good for several reasons.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.720
One, I bet he's very tender in that situation,

14:56.720 --> 14:59.040
but he has a good bedside manner

14:59.040 --> 15:00.640
when somebody's shuffling off.

15:00.640 --> 15:01.840
That's why I can hear him say,

15:01.840 --> 15:03.120
it's okay, it's gonna be okay.

15:03.760 --> 15:06.000
You're gonna be a piece.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.320
It's hard to say shh in a Harvey Fierstein voice.

15:08.320 --> 15:11.520
Sheesh, sheesh, sheesh.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.680
She just sounds like a malfunctioning robot.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.760
Also, I feel like after a few minutes of it,

15:19.760 --> 15:20.960
I would just sort of be ready

15:20.960 --> 15:24.560
to just not hear it anymore,

15:24.560 --> 15:26.080
to just be like anywhere else,

15:26.720 --> 15:28.640
including the infinite that I'm about to merge with.

15:29.200 --> 15:31.280
I think Tommy Lee Jones would shame me

15:31.280 --> 15:32.480
into coming back to life.

15:32.480 --> 15:33.600
Oh shit.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.640
What do you think you're doing?

15:34.640 --> 15:38.160
You're trying to fall asleep, to die.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.480
You're ready to die now?

15:40.480 --> 15:41.440
Come back to life, coward.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.160
I should have known that this question

15:44.160 --> 15:45.840
was going to surface the fact

15:45.840 --> 15:48.160
that we're fucking bad at impressions.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.080
I don't know what you're talking about.

15:50.080 --> 15:51.040
We are nailing these.

15:51.040 --> 15:54.800
Now what if Tim Curry was there stroking your hair?

15:54.800 --> 15:55.300
Griffin.

15:57.680 --> 16:00.880
The impression all three of us can do, slam dunk.

16:00.880 --> 16:03.120
Griffin, I brought you a fresh cheese pizza.

16:07.920 --> 16:09.440
It's full of adrenaline.

16:10.960 --> 16:13.040
I'll shove it straight in your heart, Griffin.

16:13.040 --> 16:20.720
See you met my faithful Saint Peter.

16:20.720 --> 16:21.600
All that would be good.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.720
I bet I would do Channing Tatum

16:24.720 --> 16:26.800
just because I'd like to hang out with him.

16:27.360 --> 16:28.960
The one thing that we're not addressing here

16:28.960 --> 16:31.200
is it's great to meet these awesome celebrities,

16:31.200 --> 16:32.480
but who's going to be the best one

16:32.480 --> 16:33.680
at stroking your hair?

16:33.680 --> 16:34.480
You know what I mean?

16:34.480 --> 16:35.760
Because I think Channing Tatum

16:35.760 --> 16:38.000
is going to end up being pretty lazy about it.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.920
Yeah, and he would do a bro laugh.

16:40.560 --> 16:42.960
Yeah, and that's not going to make you feel comfortable.

16:42.960 --> 16:43.600
I want to be soothed.

16:43.600 --> 16:44.000
How about this?

16:44.000 --> 16:44.960
Let me hit you guys with this.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.720
Dolly fucking Parton.

16:46.720 --> 16:48.640
Oh, that's a good one.

16:48.640 --> 16:49.680
That's very good.

16:49.680 --> 16:50.560
I would do that today.

16:51.120 --> 16:52.560
I would do that today.

16:52.560 --> 16:53.520
I would die today

16:53.520 --> 16:55.600
if I could get Dolly Parton to stroke my hair

16:55.600 --> 16:57.360
while I go, while I shuffle.

16:57.360 --> 16:59.840
Can I say somebody who I think would be surprisingly good

16:59.840 --> 17:01.040
would be Jon Favreau?

17:01.680 --> 17:02.720
I feel like Jon Favreau.

17:02.720 --> 17:03.280
You know what?

17:03.280 --> 17:04.800
Yeah, because he makes it special.

17:05.440 --> 17:06.000
He does.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.760
You know, he makes everything a little fun.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.640
You watch Zathura and you think like,

17:10.640 --> 17:13.360
this is going to be like a dumb space Jumanji

17:13.360 --> 17:16.160
rip off some Dax Shepard action.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.760
But then you know what happens there at the end?

17:17.760 --> 17:19.360
They make it kind of special, don't they?

17:20.000 --> 17:21.280
They do make it special.

17:21.280 --> 17:22.400
What do you guys think about this?

17:23.200 --> 17:24.000
Ving Rhames.

17:25.600 --> 17:26.080
Damn.

17:26.080 --> 17:27.200
Ving Rhames.

17:29.440 --> 17:32.000
Yeah, probably surprisingly tender.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.680
I mean, he's no Michael Clark Duncan

17:33.680 --> 17:34.880
who would have been a fantastic-

17:34.880 --> 17:37.280
Well, this says you can summon any celebrity living or dead.

17:37.280 --> 17:38.080
So, oh my God.

17:38.080 --> 17:38.720
How could that?

17:38.720 --> 17:39.360
Okay, that's-

17:39.360 --> 17:40.160
Okay, Jesus.

17:40.160 --> 17:40.880
Game over.

17:40.880 --> 17:41.360
Well, no.

17:41.920 --> 17:43.040
I'm going to summon Jesus.

17:43.040 --> 17:43.680
Yeah, of course.

17:43.680 --> 17:44.080
Jesus.

17:44.080 --> 17:44.640
Hey, what's up?

17:44.640 --> 17:45.200
Where am I?

17:45.200 --> 17:46.080
You're in a hospital.

17:46.080 --> 17:46.720
I'm dying.

17:46.720 --> 17:47.120
Cool.

17:47.120 --> 17:47.920
So did you need anything?

17:47.920 --> 17:48.160
Yeah.

17:48.160 --> 17:48.960
Can I get in heaven?

17:48.960 --> 17:49.440
I guess.

17:49.440 --> 17:49.760
Sure.

17:49.760 --> 17:50.400
Cool, boob.

17:50.960 --> 17:51.440
Perfect.

17:51.440 --> 17:51.760
Perfect.

17:51.760 --> 17:53.920
Oh, I should have asked him to keep me from dying.

17:54.480 --> 17:54.960
Too late.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.920
No, Michael Clark Duncan would be so sick

17:57.920 --> 17:58.720
because he could be like,

17:58.720 --> 18:00.080
it's pretty dope up there.

18:01.040 --> 18:02.480
You're going to really dig it.

18:02.480 --> 18:03.680
Now let me stroke your hair.

18:03.680 --> 18:04.960
I don't got any, but-

18:04.960 --> 18:08.000
Let me open my mouth and eat your disease.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.240
That's he, I told you this so many times

18:10.240 --> 18:11.760
that that was not a documentary.

18:13.760 --> 18:14.240
You know what?

18:14.240 --> 18:15.520
I'm going to go back on what I said

18:15.520 --> 18:17.120
and I'm just going to stick with the cool factor

18:17.120 --> 18:18.160
and go with John Stamos.

18:18.960 --> 18:19.360
Okay.

18:19.360 --> 18:20.720
You think John Stamos would be good?

18:20.720 --> 18:21.680
What if he tried to turn it

18:21.680 --> 18:23.280
into a fucking yogurt commercial though?

18:24.640 --> 18:25.760
I'm counting on that.

18:26.560 --> 18:27.040
You know what?

18:28.160 --> 18:28.560
You know what?

18:28.560 --> 18:30.400
The last thing I'd want in my mouth is

18:30.400 --> 18:33.360
some oikos, blueberry animals.

18:33.360 --> 18:36.320
You know, dying is a regular part of life.

18:36.320 --> 18:38.000
And speaking of regular,

18:38.000 --> 18:39.840
just a little bit of yogurt every day

18:39.840 --> 18:41.440
will help keep you that way.

18:41.440 --> 18:41.840
I just-

18:41.840 --> 18:42.560
Goodbye.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.000
Goodbye, sweet prince.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.400
I just needed a kidney transplant,

18:46.400 --> 18:47.360
but I couldn't find-

18:47.360 --> 18:48.320
Actually I'm compatible.

18:48.320 --> 18:49.200
I'm John Stamos.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.080
I can give you a kidney.

18:50.080 --> 18:50.880
Just one question though.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.240
What's your favorite yogurt?

18:52.240 --> 18:53.280
Jibany.

18:53.280 --> 18:54.400
Bye motherfucker.

18:55.840 --> 18:56.240
Wrong.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.640
Say hi to Satan for me.

18:58.640 --> 19:01.280
Is John Stamos a universal kidney donor?

19:01.920 --> 19:02.640
I'm a universal-

19:02.640 --> 19:03.600
My kidneys are perfect.

19:03.600 --> 19:04.880
I'm John fucking Stamos.

19:04.880 --> 19:05.920
Just one question.

19:05.920 --> 19:07.680
What kind of yogurt do you like to party with?

19:07.680 --> 19:08.480
Go-gurt.

19:08.480 --> 19:09.120
Go-gurt?

19:09.120 --> 19:10.320
Yeah, I'm seven.

19:10.320 --> 19:10.820
Bye.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.080
You're going to Chobani hell.

19:15.600 --> 19:18.240
Saint Peter appeared to you to whisk you away

19:18.240 --> 19:19.920
and he was like, have mercy.

19:27.440 --> 19:28.000
God, I just-

19:28.960 --> 19:30.320
I think I honestly,

19:30.320 --> 19:31.680
I would be happy with any celebrity.

19:31.680 --> 19:33.520
Beggars can't really be choosers.

19:33.520 --> 19:34.240
Wallace Shawn.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.320
Wallace Shawn would be really good.

19:36.320 --> 19:37.520
Oh my God, guys.

19:37.520 --> 19:38.320
Owen Wilson.

19:39.680 --> 19:40.160
Why him?

19:40.160 --> 19:40.880
So soothing.

19:42.400 --> 19:44.800
Yeah, you're gonna die.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.080
Hold on, wait, let me try again.

19:46.080 --> 19:47.360
Yeah, you're gonna-

19:47.360 --> 19:48.640
It's gonna be real cool.

19:48.640 --> 19:49.280
You're just gonna die-

19:49.280 --> 19:50.560
You sound like Dr. Evil.

19:50.560 --> 19:52.240
Yeah, you're just gonna die and stuff.

19:53.120 --> 19:53.620
Yeah.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.760
And I don't know, it's gonna be okay

19:57.760 --> 19:58.800
because you know-

20:00.800 --> 20:01.840
What is that?

20:01.840 --> 20:03.200
What is that?

20:04.080 --> 20:05.680
Everybody knows you're about to die,

20:05.680 --> 20:08.400
but what my book reaches poses is maybe you didn't.

20:08.400 --> 20:09.360
Oh man, what a great-

20:09.360 --> 20:11.120
I like that when Griffin does an impression

20:12.880 --> 20:14.000
of Owen Wilson,

20:14.000 --> 20:17.040
he ages him 40 years for some reason.

20:17.040 --> 20:18.320
You're gonna die, you know?

20:20.240 --> 20:21.760
Brothers, I have a birthday coming up

20:21.760 --> 20:23.760
and every year I'm plagued by the sheer number

20:23.760 --> 20:25.520
of happy birthday wishes I get.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.640
They range from close friends and family

20:28.640 --> 20:30.240
to basically total randos.

20:30.240 --> 20:31.920
I have no idea how to respond.

20:31.920 --> 20:33.520
Do I simply like every status?

20:33.520 --> 20:35.040
Oh, so like a Facebook thing.

20:35.040 --> 20:35.680
Yeah, yeah.

20:35.680 --> 20:38.480
Do I respond to everyone with a heartfelt paragraph?

20:38.480 --> 20:40.560
Is it rude to only respond to some?

20:40.560 --> 20:42.320
Do I completely ignore all of them?

20:42.320 --> 20:43.440
Am I good?

20:43.440 --> 20:45.280
That's from No Clue in North Carolina.

20:45.280 --> 20:45.920
You know what I like?

20:45.920 --> 20:46.720
You know what move I like?

20:47.760 --> 20:48.800
Thanks, you too.

20:48.800 --> 20:50.080
But Griffin, it's not their birthday.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.800
Yeah, that's the fucking bit.

20:52.800 --> 20:54.560
But that seems like it would be confusing to them

20:54.560 --> 20:56.000
because they would say like, me too.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.120
What could he mean by that?

20:57.120 --> 21:00.960
I think that you only highlight the best ones.

21:00.960 --> 21:01.920
You only think the best ones.

21:01.920 --> 21:03.200
And then people understand

21:03.200 --> 21:04.960
that like everything in life is a competition.

21:04.960 --> 21:06.720
And if they didn't get that thanks,

21:06.720 --> 21:08.400
then maybe they should have put

21:08.400 --> 21:09.520
a little bit more effort into it.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.840
And I think that because I put a lot of fucking effort.

21:11.840 --> 21:14.400
I, oh man, I holler for that thank you.

21:14.400 --> 21:15.360
You know what I mean?

21:15.360 --> 21:17.760
I disagree, Griffin, because I live a life

21:17.760 --> 21:19.920
of a social contract that I understand

21:19.920 --> 21:21.280
I'm putting the least amount of effort

21:21.280 --> 21:23.440
and just putting happy birthday exclamation point.

21:23.440 --> 21:26.240
Maybe I capitalize H and B, maybe.

21:26.240 --> 21:28.080
And I know that they don't have to respond.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.000
But they know that I knew it was their birthday.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.320
And I know that they knew that I knew it was their birthday.

21:32.320 --> 21:33.280
And we're done.

21:33.280 --> 21:36.400
I get on YouTube and I find,

21:38.000 --> 21:40.800
I search like happy birthday, Douglas,

21:40.800 --> 21:44.080
or if it's Douglas's birthday.

21:44.080 --> 21:47.600
And I Google, I YouTube search that.

21:47.600 --> 21:50.400
And I find videos of like parents singing

21:50.400 --> 21:52.320
to their kids happy birthday, Douglas.

21:52.320 --> 21:53.360
And put that on their wall.

21:53.360 --> 21:55.520
That's especially good for your orphan friends.

21:55.520 --> 21:58.000
Yeah, I like to make it special, you know?

21:58.000 --> 22:00.320
See, I sometimes will just have Teresa log in

22:00.320 --> 22:02.000
and wish someone a happy birthday for me.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.520
But I don't let her fancy it up.

22:03.520 --> 22:05.680
Happy birthday, exclamation point, done.

22:07.200 --> 22:08.720
I've actually stopped doing this

22:09.520 --> 22:10.720
because I live in constant fear

22:10.720 --> 22:12.160
that people are changing their birthdays

22:12.160 --> 22:13.520
on Facebook all the time.

22:13.520 --> 22:15.040
Just like try and catch you in a trap

22:15.040 --> 22:16.320
because I used to do that.

22:16.320 --> 22:18.480
And I feel fucking terrible about it now.

22:18.480 --> 22:20.480
But that used to be my jam in college.

22:20.480 --> 22:22.720
Like when Facebook was still in its infancy

22:22.720 --> 22:25.200
and I would change my birthday to like today

22:25.200 --> 22:28.320
and just like wait and see like the closest person

22:28.320 --> 22:30.560
who would write on my wall wishing me happy birthday.

22:30.560 --> 22:32.720
Just to see like, I guess you don't love me at all, huh?

22:33.440 --> 22:35.680
We all have those wild college stories.

22:39.840 --> 22:42.720
I do, listen, I do get, I was going to make fun

22:42.720 --> 22:44.480
of this question asker a little bit

22:44.480 --> 22:46.400
and say like, oh, first world problem.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.240
But I actually, I really totally get it.

22:48.240 --> 22:50.880
The more I think about it, you try to stay on top of it.

22:50.880 --> 22:52.720
And like the first couple hours of the day,

22:52.720 --> 22:54.000
you know, you're really good.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.760
Like thanks man, or like, you know,

22:55.760 --> 22:57.280
at least liking everyone.

22:57.280 --> 22:59.120
But then like, as you go about your day

22:59.120 --> 23:01.600
and get caught up doing stuff, you lose it.

23:01.600 --> 23:03.600
And then pretty soon it's like two days later

23:03.600 --> 23:04.880
and you're like, do I go back through

23:05.440 --> 23:07.040
and say thank you to everyone now?

23:07.040 --> 23:08.640
Or will that just seem hollow?

23:08.640 --> 23:08.960
Yeah.

23:08.960 --> 23:10.640
Or like, I get it.

23:10.640 --> 23:11.520
Let me propose.

23:11.520 --> 23:12.960
Just like a general post.

23:12.960 --> 23:15.440
Like I'm overwhelmed by all the birthday wishes.

23:15.440 --> 23:16.560
Thank you so much.

23:16.560 --> 23:19.280
Wish I could like them all, but I'm like out there.

23:19.280 --> 23:20.880
That would take like 45 seconds.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.640
I'm like trying to live my life.

23:22.640 --> 23:25.440
I'm living my life every damn day to the fullest.

23:25.440 --> 23:28.160
Until Wallashawn strokes my hair till I die.

23:28.160 --> 23:29.360
Strokes me to death.

23:29.360 --> 23:30.560
Let me hit you all with this.

23:32.960 --> 23:35.040
Wallashawn strokes me to death.

23:35.040 --> 23:38.080
This is like sort of, I guess, a catch-all for any sort of-

23:38.080 --> 23:39.840
Wait, sidebar.

23:39.840 --> 23:41.200
Quick Wallashawn sidebar.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.240
All right.

23:42.240 --> 23:44.080
Sydney just read the book.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.040
Yeah, Rachel did too.

23:45.760 --> 23:46.720
Princess Bride.

23:46.720 --> 23:49.680
She told me the best story about Wallashawn

23:49.680 --> 23:52.800
that apparently he had it in his head

23:52.800 --> 23:56.720
that what they really wanted was Danny DeVito for the part.

23:56.720 --> 23:59.120
But they couldn't get DeVito, so they got Wallashawn.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.960
Carl Ryder denies this, but Wallashawn was convinced about it.

24:02.960 --> 24:07.120
And he said that about half of the time they were filming,

24:07.120 --> 24:09.920
he was really distracted because he kept thinking in his head

24:09.920 --> 24:12.640
about how Danny DeVito would have done it better

24:12.640 --> 24:14.800
and how he could do it more like Danny DeVito.

24:14.800 --> 24:16.480
Can you imagine being haunted by the specter?

24:16.480 --> 24:17.840
Yeah, that's my every day.

24:17.840 --> 24:20.560
It's like, look over your shoulder, it's DeVito.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.480
He's always there waiting for you to trip up.

24:22.480 --> 24:23.920
Oh, just in the corner of your eye,

24:23.920 --> 24:25.760
but if you look directly at him, he disappears.

24:25.760 --> 24:26.720
And you're like, what was that?

24:27.520 --> 24:28.720
Nothing, nothing, Wallace.

24:28.720 --> 24:29.760
Just go on.

24:29.760 --> 24:30.800
Let's start at the top.

24:30.800 --> 24:32.080
It's Mr. Steel your role.

24:32.080 --> 24:35.360
He's right there waiting, waiting to jump into the scene.

24:35.360 --> 24:37.520
DeVito, the original Babadook.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.520
This is sort of, I guess, a catch-all

24:41.520 --> 24:43.840
for any sort of social media quandary.

24:43.840 --> 24:49.200
And that is that none of this garbage matters at all.

24:50.400 --> 24:53.360
Is that, am I the only one on that page

24:53.360 --> 24:54.960
where like nobody gives a fuck?

24:54.960 --> 24:58.880
They were forgetting that they were doing it letter by letter.

24:58.880 --> 25:02.000
Like by the time they wrote the Y and exclamation point

25:02.000 --> 25:04.560
in Happy Birthday, it was gone, what?

25:05.440 --> 25:08.480
And even if it's like, we'll take it to the extreme, right?

25:08.480 --> 25:10.560
Say it's your like your triple grandma

25:10.560 --> 25:12.640
and she's like, she grandmas real hard

25:12.640 --> 25:15.040
and she spends like three hours

25:15.040 --> 25:17.040
artisanally crafting a Facebook post

25:17.040 --> 25:18.800
and then just sort of like F5s it

25:18.800 --> 25:20.240
waiting for that like to pop up.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.680
And it doesn't, she will be upset about it

25:25.680 --> 25:27.920
for like 12 minutes.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.680
And then that's that moment.

25:30.880 --> 25:33.600
And then that moment is gone.

25:33.600 --> 25:34.640
It's in the past.

25:34.640 --> 25:37.280
And it's not even like an especially savory moment.

25:38.080 --> 25:39.200
Here's the thing.

25:39.200 --> 25:42.000
The problem is that it's taken over

25:42.000 --> 25:44.800
what used to be like, oh, it's my best friend's birthday.

25:44.800 --> 25:46.480
I'm gonna send them a card.

25:46.480 --> 25:48.320
And now it's like, oh, it's my best friend's birthday.

25:48.320 --> 25:51.040
I'm going to do the minimal amount of effort

25:51.040 --> 25:52.320
to wish them Happy Birthday.

25:52.320 --> 25:53.680
The card thing is also debatable

25:53.680 --> 25:54.560
because then you're extending,

25:54.560 --> 25:57.840
you're prolonging that moment, that magic moment

25:57.840 --> 26:00.960
for, I don't know, like an hour or two.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.120
But then nobody's gonna remember that fucking card.

26:03.120 --> 26:03.520
You know what I mean?

26:05.280 --> 26:06.240
I get what you're saying.

26:06.240 --> 26:09.120
It's just like anything you've ever done

26:09.120 --> 26:10.240
all the time you've ever spent

26:10.240 --> 26:12.000
like tweeting great shit on Twitter

26:12.000 --> 26:15.360
unless you like got a comedy writing gig

26:15.360 --> 26:16.800
off of how good your tweets are,

26:16.800 --> 26:18.720
which like six people have done.

26:18.720 --> 26:20.080
Like none of that shit matters.

26:20.080 --> 26:22.480
Or you got three episodes of a sitcom

26:23.840 --> 26:26.160
like the Shit My Dad Says guy.

26:26.160 --> 26:28.400
Like none of that, none of it matters.

26:28.400 --> 26:28.720
None of it matters.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.000
If it is your best friend's birthday,

26:30.000 --> 26:32.160
if it's someone that you would want to like

26:32.800 --> 26:34.960
wish you a Happy Birthday, give them a call.

26:34.960 --> 26:37.760
It's like 40 seconds, a minute most

26:37.760 --> 26:40.960
and just say like, hey, I'm willing to speak to you

26:40.960 --> 26:42.320
as one human being to another

26:42.320 --> 26:44.400
without written word getting in the way.

26:44.400 --> 26:45.280
I love you very much.

26:45.280 --> 26:46.080
Happy Birthday.

26:46.080 --> 26:48.720
I'm not like upset that we're fielding questions

26:48.720 --> 26:50.800
about social media aptitude.

26:50.800 --> 26:51.600
I'm not.

26:51.600 --> 26:52.560
I just don't want you,

26:52.560 --> 26:56.080
I don't want anybody to like waste a precious moment

26:56.080 --> 26:59.200
of this, you know, spin around this crazy,

26:59.760 --> 27:01.200
this third rock from the sun,

27:02.000 --> 27:04.480
fucking stressing about their favorites.

27:04.480 --> 27:05.040
You know what I mean?

27:05.040 --> 27:05.680
It's an excellent point

27:05.680 --> 27:08.160
because at this point it's your birthday.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.160
The last thing any of these people

27:10.160 --> 27:12.480
who care about you enough to like

27:12.480 --> 27:14.640
at least say Happy Birthday to you,

27:14.640 --> 27:16.960
they're not doing it to stress you out

27:16.960 --> 27:19.040
worrying about who you're going to respond to.

27:19.760 --> 27:21.360
Like, and if they are,

27:21.360 --> 27:23.600
then you don't need to respond to them in the first place.

27:24.240 --> 27:25.920
So like either they love you enough

27:25.920 --> 27:27.520
that they don't, that they're doing it

27:27.520 --> 27:29.680
because they just wanted to wish you Happy Birthday

27:29.680 --> 27:32.000
or they're doing it so that you will acknowledge

27:32.000 --> 27:34.400
that they're awesome people who wish you Happy Birthday.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.400
Either way, you don't have to worry about it.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.960
Just power down your Asus,

27:39.760 --> 27:40.800
shut it down,

27:40.800 --> 27:41.840
close your clients,

27:42.400 --> 27:43.840
go out there, eat a nice meal,

27:44.800 --> 27:47.760
go just take a dip in a beautiful crystal clear spring.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.840
And then quietly die.

27:49.840 --> 27:51.840
And quietly die while Wallace Shawn

27:51.840 --> 27:53.200
just kisses you on the neck.

27:55.440 --> 27:59.040
I just died in Wallace Shawn's arms tonight.

28:00.240 --> 28:02.720
I added some syllables back there.

28:02.720 --> 28:03.920
Yeah.

28:03.920 --> 28:05.120
Okay, money time.

28:05.120 --> 28:05.600
Here we go.

28:15.600 --> 28:17.200
Do you guys think 2015 is the year

28:17.200 --> 28:19.680
that we fucking just get off Twitter altogether?

28:19.680 --> 28:20.480
Do you think it's the year that we just-

28:20.480 --> 28:21.760
The three of us?

28:21.760 --> 28:23.280
The three of us can be the captains

28:23.280 --> 28:26.560
of the fucking Exodus space freighter.

28:26.560 --> 28:27.920
I love Twitter.

28:27.920 --> 28:30.640
If fucking 2014 didn't drive me off of Twitter,

28:30.640 --> 28:32.560
I don't know what's going to do, honestly.

28:32.560 --> 28:34.160
2014, we were all under assault.

28:34.160 --> 28:35.200
We were all under attack so much.

28:35.200 --> 28:37.360
We had enemies at the gates at every gate.

28:37.360 --> 28:38.960
There were like 30 gates and there were enemies

28:38.960 --> 28:39.520
at all of them.

28:39.520 --> 28:41.440
We didn't have time to play in the Exodus.

28:41.440 --> 28:42.480
This is the year.

28:42.480 --> 28:43.680
Two of every animal.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.280
Let's fucking do it, guys.

28:45.280 --> 28:46.800
Come on, get on my freighter.

28:46.800 --> 28:48.000
Come on, we're going to LO.

28:48.960 --> 28:50.640
They're all going to LO together.

28:50.640 --> 28:51.520
We're gonna be safe.

28:51.520 --> 28:52.560
Get in my car, we're going to LO.

28:53.760 --> 28:55.840
Have you ever wanted to build an iPhone app?

28:55.840 --> 28:56.720
To replace Twitter?

28:57.440 --> 29:00.720
Do you ever want to make an Instagram or Snapchat

29:00.720 --> 29:03.600
like that but better to replace Twitter?

29:03.600 --> 29:05.600
Do you want to learn Swift by Apple?

29:05.600 --> 29:06.560
We got good news.

29:07.360 --> 29:11.600
One month iOS is an easy way to learn iOS development

29:11.600 --> 29:12.560
using Swift.

29:12.560 --> 29:15.520
So one month, if you are not already acquainted,

29:16.240 --> 29:17.440
is a 30-day program.

29:17.440 --> 29:19.760
You give it 30 minutes a day for 30 days.

29:19.760 --> 29:25.040
And it is going to teach you a real life skill.

29:25.040 --> 29:28.000
One month HTML is a thing that I've been doing

29:28.000 --> 29:30.720
and I found it really, really helpful.

29:30.720 --> 29:34.880
One month Rails to help you make your first web app.

29:35.680 --> 29:38.480
Think how much time you learn on the internet

29:38.480 --> 29:40.160
learning shit that doesn't matter

29:40.160 --> 29:41.840
and doesn't help you at all.

29:41.840 --> 29:44.000
You're talking about like all the 100% of it?

29:44.000 --> 29:44.480
Yeah.

29:44.480 --> 29:46.080
Except for the time that you spend on one month?

29:46.720 --> 29:47.760
Yes, exactly.

29:47.760 --> 29:49.680
Here's something you can waste your time on the internet.

29:49.680 --> 29:50.960
That's not a waste.

29:50.960 --> 29:51.760
It's good for you.

29:53.040 --> 29:53.840
It's good for you.

29:53.840 --> 29:55.840
It's just like this is my new 2015 thing.

29:55.840 --> 29:58.080
We're all fucking bad at the internet.

29:58.080 --> 30:00.480
We all click on shit that we know is gonna make us angry

30:00.480 --> 30:02.240
because dumb people wrote it to make you angry

30:02.240 --> 30:03.680
to click on it to get money.

30:03.680 --> 30:04.400
It's fucking...

30:04.400 --> 30:05.440
It's time to leave.

30:06.320 --> 30:06.960
We're off.

30:06.960 --> 30:08.000
We're done with the internet.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.960
Download this podcast and then cancel your account

30:10.960 --> 30:13.360
and then re-open your account in a week

30:13.360 --> 30:14.880
to download this podcast again.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.160
The only thing you should be doing-

30:16.160 --> 30:17.040
Rinse and repeat.

30:17.040 --> 30:18.640
Unless it's an Adventure Zone week,

30:18.640 --> 30:19.440
then grab that.

30:19.440 --> 30:19.840
Grab that also.

30:19.840 --> 30:24.240
And maybe Bunker Buddies if you're looking for it.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.920
What days can you turn off the internet?

30:25.920 --> 30:27.680
What days can you have your internet disconnected?

30:27.680 --> 30:28.320
The weekends.

30:28.320 --> 30:28.880
You shouldn't be spending-

30:28.880 --> 30:29.360
I think Friday.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.360
We spend every Sunday on the internet

30:31.360 --> 30:32.800
recording this goddamn show.

30:32.800 --> 30:35.280
And it's like, it makes me cry inside.

30:35.280 --> 30:35.680
That's the thing.

30:35.680 --> 30:37.440
When Wallace Shawn's stroking my hair in the deathbed,

30:37.440 --> 30:39.600
you'd be like, do you have any regrets?

30:39.600 --> 30:40.800
That was fucking awesome.

30:41.600 --> 30:42.960
That was fucking awesome.

30:42.960 --> 30:43.760
That was great.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.360
Guys, I've never tried that before.

30:45.360 --> 30:49.280
That was a one take Wallace Shawn fucking slam dunk hoop shot.

30:49.280 --> 30:50.800
Wallace Shawn no go.

30:50.800 --> 30:52.240
Do you have any regrets?

30:52.240 --> 30:52.880
And I'll be like-

30:52.880 --> 30:54.640
You should edit, edit in,

30:54.640 --> 30:56.160
edit out all the ones you did before that.

30:56.160 --> 30:56.560
And then-

30:56.560 --> 30:57.600
No, don't say that.

30:58.400 --> 30:59.200
Don't say that.

30:59.200 --> 31:00.320
That was my first try at it.

31:00.320 --> 31:01.120
Edit that in.

31:01.120 --> 31:02.480
God damn it, Justin.

31:03.200 --> 31:04.640
I'll let you saying that out.

31:04.640 --> 31:05.600
Now who's the victor?

31:06.880 --> 31:08.960
I am the king of content.

31:08.960 --> 31:11.600
Ah, but Griffin, if you edit out him saying that,

31:11.600 --> 31:13.360
it will be a paradox.

31:13.360 --> 31:13.760
Okay.

31:13.760 --> 31:16.400
This is going to be a 45 second long episode of

31:16.400 --> 31:17.680
Wallace Shawn strokes my hair.

31:17.680 --> 31:19.200
What are you, you got any regrets?

31:19.200 --> 31:20.000
That's not as good.

31:20.000 --> 31:20.960
Oh, you tried to begin.

31:20.960 --> 31:21.680
Shut up.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.240
And I'll say-

31:22.240 --> 31:22.880
I'm greedy.

31:22.880 --> 31:23.380
Yeah.

31:24.480 --> 31:27.280
A lot of wasted Sunday hours I could have spent in church.

31:27.280 --> 31:28.480
Anyway, what are we talking about?

31:28.480 --> 31:29.040
One month.

31:29.760 --> 31:31.920
One month.com slash my brother.

31:31.920 --> 31:36.720
You're going to be able to save 25% off of your first class.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.000
That's a one time discount.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.360
25% and you can get a real life skill.

31:41.360 --> 31:44.160
It's broken down into 30 minutes a day for one month

31:44.160 --> 31:46.720
and you can get a something really useful

31:46.720 --> 31:48.480
and make some good use of your internet time.

31:48.480 --> 31:51.680
One month.com slash my brother.

31:51.680 --> 31:53.520
When you're spending your time not on the internet,

31:53.520 --> 31:54.640
just sort of wasting away,

31:56.160 --> 31:57.920
you're going to go on some adventures out there.

31:57.920 --> 32:00.080
2015, year of cons, year of adventures.

32:01.600 --> 32:02.800
And while you're on adventures,

32:02.800 --> 32:06.160
you're going to need some snacks in your gunny sack,

32:06.160 --> 32:07.600
in your adventure bag.

32:07.600 --> 32:08.960
And what can you stuff in there?

32:08.960 --> 32:11.760
Why, I have a suggestion, some nature box.

32:11.760 --> 32:14.720
While you're out in nature, just like smelling a tree,

32:14.720 --> 32:16.240
smelling some bark,

32:16.240 --> 32:18.640
I want you to reach in your bag and you're going to pull out

32:18.640 --> 32:21.440
over a hundred nutritionist approved snacks.

32:21.440 --> 32:22.960
Nature box has something for everyone.

32:22.960 --> 32:26.240
It's got no artificial flavors, no colors, no sweeteners.

32:26.240 --> 32:27.760
No, it got zero grams.

32:27.760 --> 32:28.880
Hold on.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.240
It does have colors.

32:30.240 --> 32:31.680
It doesn't have artificial colors.

32:31.680 --> 32:34.160
No, it can't be perceived by the dumb cones

32:34.160 --> 32:35.600
in your human eyes.

32:35.600 --> 32:38.080
Only locusts can see nature box snacks.

32:39.520 --> 32:41.680
They don't have GMOs, but they are invisible.

32:41.680 --> 32:42.640
It's fucked up.

32:42.640 --> 32:44.480
Anyway, they don't got trans fats.

32:44.480 --> 32:45.840
They don't got high fructose corn syrup.

32:45.840 --> 32:46.800
They don't got tweets.

32:48.400 --> 32:51.040
Anyway, you can get all kinds of great stuff.

32:51.040 --> 32:52.880
They got sriracha roasted cashews.

32:52.880 --> 32:54.880
They got pistachio power clusters.

32:54.880 --> 32:56.400
Those are going to make you more powerful.

32:57.200 --> 32:58.640
They got big island pineapple.

32:58.640 --> 33:01.600
That's going to help you appreciate the beaches

33:01.600 --> 33:03.120
that you're exploring, that you're backpacking

33:03.120 --> 33:04.240
through Sicily.

33:04.240 --> 33:05.360
It's going to be great.

33:05.360 --> 33:07.440
You have the chance to try nature box for free

33:07.440 --> 33:09.680
with a trial box of five of their most popular snacks.

33:09.680 --> 33:10.400
Free snacks.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.400
Five of them, five bags of free snacks.

33:12.400 --> 33:13.600
You're going to get them for free

33:13.600 --> 33:15.280
because they're free snacks.

33:15.280 --> 33:18.400
What do we have to do to get you into some free snacks today?

33:19.200 --> 33:20.480
We're going to shrink your body down

33:20.480 --> 33:22.080
and we're going to put you in a bag of nature box

33:22.080 --> 33:25.120
and you're just going to have like a cocoa yum-yums

33:25.120 --> 33:26.320
ball pit experience.

33:26.320 --> 33:27.440
But what's that over there?

33:27.440 --> 33:29.680
It's a guy in a tiny exoskeleton.

33:29.680 --> 33:31.360
He's going to fight with you, but that's okay

33:31.360 --> 33:33.360
because you're going to break through the glass on his mask

33:33.360 --> 33:36.240
and then I think Martin Shorts stomach acid

33:36.240 --> 33:37.280
is going to eat away at him.

33:37.280 --> 33:38.880
I thought you said his name was Martin Shorts.

33:40.800 --> 33:42.640
Martin Shorts, the comedian.

33:42.640 --> 33:44.320
Can we all agree that Martin Shorts would be

33:45.120 --> 33:46.880
the worst deathbed buddy?

33:48.560 --> 33:50.000
He would not take it seriously.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
He would make it all about him.

33:53.120 --> 33:54.960
This is my death.

33:54.960 --> 33:57.280
Can you not be like goofing right now?

33:58.320 --> 33:59.120
Oh yeah.

33:59.120 --> 33:59.600
Oh yeah.

34:01.200 --> 34:04.480
It's your impression of the Hollywood guy.

34:04.480 --> 34:05.360
Fuck, what's his name?

34:05.920 --> 34:06.960
Jiminy Glick?

34:06.960 --> 34:07.440
Yeah.

34:07.440 --> 34:08.880
And I don't think it's an impression of him.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.160
I think he just like made him.

34:10.160 --> 34:13.280
Yeah, I don't think he's basing that on a real Jiminy Glick.

34:13.280 --> 34:14.640
Jiminy Glick, great.

34:14.640 --> 34:16.400
I wanted that to be my last.

34:16.400 --> 34:17.120
You know what, Travis?

34:17.120 --> 34:19.440
You say that, but we all know a Jiminy Glick, don't we?

34:19.440 --> 34:20.320
Look at yourself.

34:20.320 --> 34:21.200
Are you the Jiminy?

34:21.200 --> 34:23.840
If you look around the table and you don't see the Jiminy Glick,

34:23.840 --> 34:25.200
you are the Jiminy Glick.

34:25.200 --> 34:26.800
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

34:26.800 --> 34:28.960
We're going to get you those free snacks.

34:28.960 --> 34:29.760
You're going to eat them.

34:29.760 --> 34:31.440
You're going to be a happier, better person.

34:32.400 --> 34:35.280
Chelsea Care, I got a message for you from Adam Ford.

34:36.160 --> 34:40.320
And he says, what better time a year than candle lights

34:40.320 --> 34:44.240
to take revenge upon your GIF for a birthday Jumbotron message.

34:45.120 --> 34:47.840
I can suggest maybe a better time would be January 25th.

34:47.840 --> 34:51.840
And maybe January 25th is literally one calendar month after.

34:54.480 --> 34:56.320
That's what makes it a surprise.

34:56.320 --> 34:57.440
There's no Vengeance Day yet.

34:57.440 --> 34:59.520
So here's some dirt on Chelsea.

34:59.520 --> 35:00.240
Oh, shit.

35:00.240 --> 35:01.600
She's her godmother.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.520
No, no, Katie Lang.

35:03.520 --> 35:07.360
For my money, Katie Lang doing hallelujah is the best version of it.

35:07.360 --> 35:08.720
Sorry to Rebus Wainwright.

35:08.720 --> 35:10.960
Sorry to Jeff.

35:11.840 --> 35:14.880
Sorry to Shrek for Shrek's version of hallelujah.

35:14.880 --> 35:19.440
It's Shrek sings in Shrek.

35:19.440 --> 35:21.200
Chelsea is extremely good looking.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.480
Whoa, Justin.

35:22.480 --> 35:24.400
Loves border collies more than horses.

35:25.200 --> 35:26.880
Happy candle lights, Chelsea.

35:26.880 --> 35:29.040
I'm sorry that that was a month ago.

35:29.040 --> 35:30.320
It doesn't say that, but I'm saying.

35:30.320 --> 35:32.320
No, what it says is you're a butt.

35:33.520 --> 35:34.080
Oh, man.

35:34.800 --> 35:35.760
Got her, Adam.

35:35.760 --> 35:37.440
That was a zinger.

35:37.440 --> 35:40.880
Way to really nail her to the wall there, Adam.

35:40.880 --> 35:41.760
You really showed her.

35:41.760 --> 35:46.720
Do you think it's embarrassing that Katie Lang is her godmother?

35:46.720 --> 35:47.840
Because I think that's awesome.

35:47.840 --> 35:48.960
Well, he just says it's dirt.

35:48.960 --> 35:54.560
So it's like, if we need to, you know, get a private investigation going,

35:54.560 --> 35:55.600
there are the facts.

35:55.600 --> 35:59.680
We just needed a little leverage against Katie Lang.

36:01.120 --> 36:04.480
Finally, we can put our plan in place.

36:05.040 --> 36:08.640
So happy birthday, Chelsea.

36:08.640 --> 36:09.840
Nope, not birthday.

36:09.840 --> 36:13.360
Okay, you just saw the word birthday in there, and you just sort of let it roll.

36:14.000 --> 36:14.560
You know what?

36:14.560 --> 36:16.960
It's been so long, it may be her birthday bar now.

36:16.960 --> 36:18.400
It's impossible to know.

36:18.400 --> 36:19.280
Happy Arbor Day.

36:19.280 --> 36:21.360
Who knows when this fucking thing's going up?

36:21.360 --> 36:23.040
Happy Vengeance Day, Chelsea.

36:23.040 --> 36:25.840
People don't know we record these episodes months in advance.

36:26.960 --> 36:30.880
I got a message for Dave, and the message is from Casey and Matt.

36:31.600 --> 36:32.960
Casey and Matt.

36:32.960 --> 36:34.480
Oh, guys, I'm sorry.

36:34.480 --> 36:35.040
And JoJo.

36:35.920 --> 36:36.480
Come on.

36:36.480 --> 36:40.560
You think Casey has never gotten that before?

36:40.560 --> 36:43.120
I really wanted to sing that song, but then I couldn't remember it.

36:43.120 --> 36:44.880
Oh, do you mean, tell me it's real.

36:45.680 --> 36:48.320
This feeling all my life.

36:48.320 --> 36:48.880
There it is.

36:48.880 --> 36:50.000
See, a lot of people go for that.

36:50.880 --> 36:53.600
Tell Me It's Real is obviously the superior Casey and JoJo song.

36:54.720 --> 36:57.680
Listen, we could spend the rest of the episode talking about the Casey.

36:57.680 --> 37:01.360
We all have strong opinions about the Casey and JoJo oeuvre.

37:01.360 --> 37:06.960
Let me crack open the Casey and JoJo omnibus, and I will go through their b-sides.

37:06.960 --> 37:09.040
The Casey and JoJo nomicon?

37:09.040 --> 37:09.840
Can I just?

37:10.560 --> 37:14.720
Dave, Merry Christmas and congrats on your pro ability to manufacture a child.

37:14.720 --> 37:18.160
You're always hard to shop for, so we thought the best gift would be to pay the McElroy family

37:18.160 --> 37:21.680
to confess that your gigantic new baby is way better than theirs.

37:21.680 --> 37:22.080
What?

37:22.080 --> 37:23.040
Oh, no.

37:23.040 --> 37:24.160
Oh, no, son.

37:24.160 --> 37:25.120
Incorrect.

37:25.120 --> 37:25.760
Wrong O.

37:26.480 --> 37:27.040
You can't force me to say that.

37:27.040 --> 37:28.960
Baby Charlie is bringing it hot.

37:28.960 --> 37:31.120
Now, when they say better than theirs,

37:31.120 --> 37:38.800
does that intimate that Charlie is all of ours in a weird three brothers and a baby situation?

37:39.360 --> 37:40.560
Yeah, maybe.

37:40.560 --> 37:43.200
I'm pretty sure Justin has the main claim.

37:43.200 --> 37:44.480
Soul claim, yeah.

37:44.480 --> 37:45.360
Another question.

37:45.360 --> 37:47.680
Did Dave make a baby from spare parts?

37:49.040 --> 37:51.120
Dave, congratulations on Small Wondering.

37:51.680 --> 37:54.160
Everyone said you couldn't do it, and then you did do it.

37:57.280 --> 37:58.880
Small Wonder was the name of the show, right?

37:58.880 --> 38:01.200
Yeah, Small One, yeah.

38:01.200 --> 38:01.920
Yeah, right.

38:01.920 --> 38:03.360
Well, in America, that's what it was.

38:07.600 --> 38:15.760
In Europe, and I believe most of West Asia, it was called Blossom.

38:15.760 --> 38:16.800
Metric Wonder.

38:16.800 --> 38:17.040
Okay.

38:18.240 --> 38:22.880
In Japan, it was called My Daughter, the Secret, which is odd.

38:22.880 --> 38:24.640
It's an odd bit of translation.

38:24.640 --> 38:26.320
Happy birthday, Dave.

38:26.320 --> 38:28.000
Well, you didn't even finish reading the message.

38:28.000 --> 38:32.800
Okay, maybe we could set our babies up a la Swan Princess style.

38:32.800 --> 38:34.160
JK, unless you guys are into that.

38:34.160 --> 38:34.960
Merry Christmas.

38:34.960 --> 38:35.440
Love you.

38:35.440 --> 38:36.320
Okay, guys.

38:36.320 --> 38:37.440
Listen, here's a serious...

38:38.160 --> 38:41.440
We gotta stop mentioning the date that you think this will happen,

38:41.440 --> 38:42.640
because it will not happen then.

38:43.440 --> 38:45.040
You have to stop putting holidays in these places.

38:45.040 --> 38:46.160
It's nice, though, in like...

38:47.360 --> 38:47.680
I don't know.

38:47.680 --> 38:52.000
It's a nice little rainbow connection that both of these people fucked up at the same time.

38:52.000 --> 38:58.240
Like maybe somewhere underneath that big bright moon, somebody else is fucking up,

38:58.240 --> 39:00.960
in addition to me, vis-a-vis timing.

39:00.960 --> 39:02.000
Happy birthday, Dave.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.680
Happy, I don't know, Super Bowl Sunday to Chelsea.

39:07.360 --> 39:10.800
We love all of you, but we have important pressing business.

39:10.800 --> 39:11.680
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

39:11.680 --> 39:12.320
Oh, no.

39:13.920 --> 39:15.040
It's Haunted Doll Watch.

39:15.040 --> 39:18.640
Live from my brother, my brother, and me, Haunted Doll Watch, our new hit feature

39:18.640 --> 39:20.740
feature that everybody is crazy about,

39:20.740 --> 39:23.160
where I look for the latest and greatest

39:23.160 --> 39:26.960
in haunted dolls on the eBay service.

39:26.960 --> 39:29.480
Today we've got a really hot one coming in,

39:29.480 --> 39:34.360
and I mean that literally haunted, spirited, paranormal,

39:34.360 --> 39:38.160
scary, burn doll spirit Alicia Creepy.

39:38.160 --> 39:39.520
That is the listing.

39:39.520 --> 39:41.240
Let me go ahead and link my brothers there

39:41.240 --> 39:43.200
so you can find it if you're playing along at home.

39:43.200 --> 39:46.000
You can certainly just Google that on eBay.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.960
Jesus Christ. Oh my God.

39:48.960 --> 39:52.080
So this is a horrifically burned, naked baby doll,

39:52.080 --> 39:54.720
which I mention only because the story

39:54.720 --> 39:58.040
that I'm about to tell is going to seem bat shit.

39:58.040 --> 39:58.880
Here we go.

39:58.880 --> 40:03.040
Burned doll Alicia found at the remains of a house fire

40:03.040 --> 40:06.340
in 1997 in New York on Christmas Eve.

40:06.340 --> 40:08.600
The items were put out on the curb,

40:08.600 --> 40:10.240
and she was rescued by a native.

40:10.240 --> 40:11.160
Oh, I got it.

40:11.160 --> 40:12.320
Oh, I got the doll.

40:12.320 --> 40:13.640
Oh, that was cool.

40:13.640 --> 40:14.480
I saved her.

40:14.480 --> 40:16.840
I hope this shit's not haunted.

40:16.840 --> 40:19.120
The gentleman who brought her to me

40:19.120 --> 40:22.680
said his wife who rescued her, okay, which, okay, got it.

40:22.680 --> 40:24.240
I'm getting some mixed details here.

40:24.240 --> 40:25.480
Yeah, mixed details here.

40:25.480 --> 40:27.360
Kept her in her craft room.

40:27.360 --> 40:28.840
Burn the craft room.

40:28.840 --> 40:33.360
Listen, kept her in her craft room and would talk to her

40:33.360 --> 40:35.780
as if she could understand her every word.

40:35.780 --> 40:37.920
She was happiest when she was with the doll.

40:37.920 --> 40:40.560
I mean. Look at that fucking doll

40:40.560 --> 40:43.800
and tell me that that is not 100% cockamamie bullshit.

40:43.800 --> 40:45.400
No, I feel like you get me.

40:45.400 --> 40:47.680
You make me feel so understood,

40:47.680 --> 40:50.400
creepy, creepy, creepy burned ass doll

40:50.400 --> 40:52.400
with it looks like muscular tissue

40:52.400 --> 40:53.240
underneath your burned eyes.

40:53.240 --> 40:55.080
I'm just here to help you.

40:55.080 --> 40:56.440
I'm Harvey Fierstein.

40:56.440 --> 40:59.840
I've inhabited this burned, burned ass doll.

40:59.840 --> 41:03.640
No, the doll was apparently inhabited

41:03.640 --> 41:05.620
by a girl who was in the fire.

41:05.620 --> 41:06.460
Oh, great.

41:06.460 --> 41:07.560
Here is the next sentence.

41:07.560 --> 41:10.160
He never said anything about the doll

41:10.160 --> 41:12.120
because his wife knew the girl

41:12.120 --> 41:14.520
and was despondent about the fire.

41:15.400 --> 41:20.120
Okay, so he brings his wife home a burned doll.

41:20.120 --> 41:22.160
Hey honey. From a trash pile.

41:22.160 --> 41:25.440
I got you this garbage ass burned ass doll.

41:25.440 --> 41:27.080
Maybe haunted.

41:27.080 --> 41:28.220
Do you want to talk to it?

41:28.220 --> 41:30.120
Maybe put it in your craft room.

41:30.120 --> 41:32.000
You were just saying how you wanted more,

41:32.000 --> 41:35.060
you wanted more ruined shitty garbage.

41:36.160 --> 41:37.680
His wife recently passed.

41:37.680 --> 41:41.080
So Alicia needs a new home.

41:41.080 --> 41:44.200
Her unique traits are a cold chill

41:44.200 --> 41:46.040
in the area surrounding her.

41:46.040 --> 41:48.400
There may be more if you're accepted by her.

41:48.400 --> 41:52.560
I'm selling her for Mr. Beck, the owner of the doll.

41:52.560 --> 41:55.320
Wait, I want to break down that last thing.

41:55.320 --> 41:57.600
If you're accepted by her, like if she's like,

41:57.600 --> 41:58.880
yeah, you're cool, we can hang.

41:58.880 --> 41:59.720
You're cool.

41:59.720 --> 42:02.840
Now let me just sort of demonstrate some more

42:02.840 --> 42:04.400
of my ghost powers.

42:04.400 --> 42:05.680
Did you want that table to float?

42:05.680 --> 42:07.080
Cause now it's floating.

42:07.080 --> 42:08.040
Are you chilling?

42:08.040 --> 42:11.960
There are six pictures of this doll on the eBay.

42:11.960 --> 42:14.000
Sorry, eight pictures of the doll.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.720
In case you didn't get it from the first one,

42:15.720 --> 42:17.280
where it's a horrifically burned mess.

42:17.280 --> 42:19.880
And if you look closely at the pictures of the doll,

42:19.880 --> 42:23.720
you'll notice that she's sitting in a tiny lawn chair.

42:23.720 --> 42:25.160
Really festive.

42:25.160 --> 42:26.000
Well, that's it.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.160
She wasn't burning a fire.

42:27.160 --> 42:28.440
She got too much sun.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.840
There are two bids already on this.

42:31.840 --> 42:33.880
You want to get in there soon.

42:33.880 --> 42:35.760
Current bid is $29.

42:35.760 --> 42:39.360
So make sure you pick up Alicia creepy spirit,

42:39.360 --> 42:40.760
burn all scary paranormal.

42:40.760 --> 42:44.160
It is upsetting to me that the current bid is $29

42:44.160 --> 42:45.920
and the shipping is 23.

42:45.920 --> 42:48.600
It's upsetting to me that there is more than one bid.

42:48.600 --> 42:50.600
There's a bidding war for haunted spirit,

42:50.600 --> 42:53.200
paranormal, scary burn, doll spirit, Alicia creepy.

42:53.200 --> 42:56.840
Everybody fucking hop in to my vessel.

42:58.080 --> 42:59.080
Away we go.

42:59.080 --> 42:59.920
Bye internet.

42:59.920 --> 43:01.440
Bye internet forever.

43:03.320 --> 43:04.160
Hi everybody.

43:04.160 --> 43:05.360
I'm Justin McElroy.

43:05.360 --> 43:06.920
And I'm Dr. Sydney McElroy.

43:06.920 --> 43:09.520
Every Tuesday we bring you saw bones,

43:09.520 --> 43:12.400
a marital tour of misguided medicine,

43:12.400 --> 43:15.760
a show about all the dumb, weird, terrible ways

43:15.760 --> 43:17.720
that we've tried to fix each other over the years.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.880
You know, some light summer listening.

43:19.880 --> 43:21.880
Maybe you want to hear about yogurt enemas

43:21.880 --> 43:24.520
or why we tried to eat mummies for a while

43:24.520 --> 43:28.040
or why drinking cholera diarrhea sounded like a good idea.

43:28.040 --> 43:31.280
That and so much more is waiting for you every Tuesday

43:31.280 --> 43:34.200
right here on the maximum fun network

43:34.200 --> 43:38.240
with saw bones, a marital tour of misguided medicine.

43:40.720 --> 43:42.360
Y'all want a yahoo?

43:42.360 --> 43:43.400
Yes.

43:43.400 --> 43:48.000
This yahoo was sent in by Eric Lawrenson.

43:48.000 --> 43:48.840
Thank you Eric.

43:48.840 --> 43:51.600
It's by yahoo answers user Christina who asks,

43:51.600 --> 43:54.400
I've always wondered this.

43:54.400 --> 43:55.960
That's in all caps.

43:55.960 --> 43:58.360
When you send out a text message

43:58.360 --> 44:02.840
and before the other person receives the message,

44:02.840 --> 44:05.080
where does it go?

44:05.080 --> 44:07.200
It has always been picking at my brain.

44:10.520 --> 44:12.320
It goes to space, right?

44:12.320 --> 44:13.160
Goes to space.

44:13.160 --> 44:15.240
It goes to the stash.

44:15.240 --> 44:17.840
That's my Sean Connery in dragon heart.

44:18.680 --> 44:19.800
Okay.

44:19.800 --> 44:21.960
And we'll start in the stars boys

44:21.960 --> 44:23.880
while your text messages go.

44:23.880 --> 44:25.240
Lots of really great impressions.

44:25.240 --> 44:27.800
A lot of really a material.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.480
I mean, first it goes across.

44:30.480 --> 44:33.600
I feel like a ticker on president Obama's desk.

44:33.600 --> 44:34.480
He clears it.

44:34.480 --> 44:37.080
He clears it for, I mean, he checks it.

44:37.080 --> 44:38.160
He miss spells words

44:38.160 --> 44:39.840
that you had actually spelled correctly.

44:39.840 --> 44:41.400
Cause he's a little scamp.

44:42.520 --> 44:43.520
Most people don't know this.

44:43.520 --> 44:44.960
Obama is spell check.

44:44.960 --> 44:46.040
He is the spell check.

44:46.040 --> 44:47.000
He is clippy.

44:47.000 --> 44:50.400
He takes your sex and he makes them sexier.

44:52.840 --> 44:53.680
He adds a lot.

44:53.680 --> 44:55.360
I'm surprised he didn't address that and say union.

44:55.360 --> 44:59.320
Like if you're wondering why I did not get more done

44:59.320 --> 45:01.880
in my tenure in office,

45:01.880 --> 45:04.880
cause I had to read all of your text messages.

45:04.880 --> 45:07.520
I had to juice up your sexts.

45:07.520 --> 45:10.200
A lot of really good impressions.

45:10.200 --> 45:12.560
You know when all of you moms out there

45:12.560 --> 45:17.520
send one single thought in like seven text messages,

45:17.520 --> 45:20.480
just word after word after word.

45:20.480 --> 45:21.720
I had to read all those.

45:23.480 --> 45:24.960
President Obama.

45:24.960 --> 45:27.480
I always imagine that text messages and phone calls

45:27.480 --> 45:29.960
are a lot like that scene in Willy Wonka.

45:29.960 --> 45:30.800
Thank you.

45:30.800 --> 45:31.880
I was literally just about to say that.

45:31.880 --> 45:34.640
That is my entire understanding of broadcast information,

45:34.640 --> 45:37.080
wireless internet, everything is that.

45:37.080 --> 45:39.760
It goes up in the sky and just kind of sits there.

45:39.760 --> 45:43.760
Turns into a little boy until you download it.

45:43.760 --> 45:46.120
You send a text, it turns into a boy.

45:46.120 --> 45:48.720
It disintegrates that boy.

45:48.720 --> 45:50.240
It sends him flying.

45:50.240 --> 45:53.040
The little boy appears on your friend's cell phone

45:53.040 --> 45:54.720
and then it's like, what up?

45:54.720 --> 45:56.440
Cause that's what you texted.

45:56.440 --> 45:58.520
And then they stretch him.

45:58.520 --> 45:59.640
Hey, you up?

46:01.000 --> 46:01.840
Hey, you up? Please let me

46:01.840 --> 46:02.680
out of your phone.

46:02.680 --> 46:03.520
It's me, Mike TV.

46:03.520 --> 46:04.360
Hey, you up?

46:10.520 --> 46:12.200
Hey, did you watch Arrow last night?

46:12.200 --> 46:13.040
From dad.

46:15.800 --> 46:18.320
Every time you text message, you kill a boy for a little bit

46:18.320 --> 46:21.000
but then he comes back to life, but little and data.

46:22.240 --> 46:24.880
That's why fucking AT&T and Verizon and all them shits,

46:24.880 --> 46:27.120
they gotta put caps on stuff.

46:27.120 --> 46:27.960
Stop killing.

46:27.960 --> 46:30.280
You went over your killing little boy limit this month

46:30.280 --> 46:31.800
and that was gonna be an extra $10.

46:31.800 --> 46:33.840
Killing's not the right word.

46:33.840 --> 46:37.640
You temporarily killing via dissolution.

46:37.640 --> 46:38.880
You dis-exist him.

46:38.880 --> 46:39.720
Yeah.

46:39.720 --> 46:40.560
That's a word.

46:40.560 --> 46:42.080
But then you re-exist him to be like.

46:44.120 --> 46:46.440
Is that why my phone memory is always so full?

46:46.440 --> 46:48.160
Cause it's just full of little boys.

46:48.160 --> 46:49.480
Uh-huh.

46:49.480 --> 46:51.480
Ah, I needed to delete some of those.

46:51.480 --> 46:52.480
You really do.

46:52.480 --> 46:56.360
Um, what, does anybody actually know?

46:56.360 --> 47:01.360
I feel like whenever like Jeff AT&T invented text messages,

47:01.440 --> 47:06.120
whenever Steven, Michael Stevens, SMS invented text messages

47:07.040 --> 47:08.760
and he like sent the first one

47:08.760 --> 47:10.200
and it showed up on somebody else's phone,

47:10.200 --> 47:12.640
he was probably like, whoa.

47:12.640 --> 47:14.520
And it said, what have God wrong?

47:14.520 --> 47:15.360
How did that happen?

47:15.360 --> 47:16.200
With the smiley face.

47:16.200 --> 47:17.520
How did that even happen?

47:17.520 --> 47:18.760
It must be Ghost Rider.

47:18.760 --> 47:21.040
And then for years, everybody thought it was Ghost Rider

47:21.040 --> 47:24.960
when the truth is that they got it, is Ghost Rider.

47:24.960 --> 47:27.480
You know when people like hold their phones up to windows

47:27.480 --> 47:29.840
or something to try to get like better service

47:29.840 --> 47:31.120
and everybody's like, what are you doing?

47:31.120 --> 47:31.960
That doesn't work.

47:31.960 --> 47:32.800
You don't know that.

47:32.800 --> 47:33.640
You don't know.

47:33.640 --> 47:34.460
You're showing. You don't know shit about phones.

47:34.460 --> 47:35.640
You're holding your phone up to the window

47:35.640 --> 47:37.160
and Ghost Rider's like floating around like,

47:37.160 --> 47:42.160
let's see, is this supposed to go to 2323 apartment B?

47:42.760 --> 47:44.680
Where is the interest?

47:44.680 --> 47:45.520
Oh, nevermind.

47:45.520 --> 47:46.340
There it is.

47:46.340 --> 47:47.180
Zoop.

47:47.180 --> 47:48.020
What up?

47:48.020 --> 47:48.840
I got a question here.

47:48.840 --> 47:49.680
Hi brothers.

47:49.680 --> 47:50.520
I don't know what to do about.

47:50.520 --> 47:51.360
I'm guessing.

47:51.360 --> 47:52.280
So I got to answer it now.

47:52.280 --> 47:53.120
Hi brothers.

47:53.120 --> 47:54.100
I don't know what to do about invitations

47:54.100 --> 47:55.880
to my Super Bowl party.

47:55.880 --> 47:58.120
Our friend group has a couple in it

47:58.120 --> 48:00.240
who recently split up due to one member

48:00.240 --> 48:02.240
of the couple finding someone new.

48:02.240 --> 48:04.840
I already stupidly told both members

48:04.840 --> 48:07.200
about the Super Bowl get together.

48:07.200 --> 48:09.780
One person says she will not attend

48:09.780 --> 48:11.980
if her ex's new significant other is there.

48:11.980 --> 48:13.320
Problem solved.

48:13.320 --> 48:14.800
Yeah, I haven't yet sent an email.

48:14.800 --> 48:17.520
How do I delicately make sure that everyone who is there

48:17.520 --> 48:19.600
will not explode in a horrible rage fight?

48:19.600 --> 48:22.360
That's from super befuddled for the Super Bowl.

48:22.360 --> 48:23.480
Let's make this quick.

48:23.480 --> 48:24.540
Like the actual practical.

48:24.540 --> 48:27.080
We can goo for, you know, talk about how

48:27.080 --> 48:29.600
we'll make them like fight or like play a football game

48:29.600 --> 48:31.040
outside in the winter camp.

48:31.040 --> 48:32.040
We'll do that dumb shit later,

48:32.040 --> 48:33.980
but I feel like we've addressed this before

48:33.980 --> 48:36.280
where that's not your goddamn problem.

48:36.280 --> 48:37.120
Nope.

48:37.120 --> 48:37.940
Super isn't your problem.

48:37.940 --> 48:38.780
Invite them both.

48:38.780 --> 48:39.600
They can show up if they want.

48:39.600 --> 48:41.440
They can be fucking adults if they want.

48:41.440 --> 48:43.960
The only beef you have to worry about is in the cheese dip.

48:43.960 --> 48:44.900
Yep.

48:44.900 --> 48:46.080
Don't put beef in your cheese dip.

48:46.080 --> 48:47.160
That seems awfully excessive.

48:47.160 --> 48:48.200
Oh no, it sounds really good.

48:48.200 --> 48:50.240
Like if you did like sausage in there, ooh.

48:50.240 --> 48:51.280
Speaking of beef,

48:51.280 --> 48:52.440
remind me to circle back around

48:52.440 --> 48:53.880
after this question about beef nugs.

48:53.880 --> 48:54.960
Remind me to circle back around

48:54.960 --> 48:56.480
and yell at everybody who listens to our show

48:56.480 --> 48:57.320
about fucking beef nugs.

48:57.320 --> 48:58.140
Hey, you know what?

48:58.140 --> 48:58.980
We answered the question.

48:58.980 --> 48:59.800
Question answered.

48:59.800 --> 49:00.640
Okay, question answered.

49:00.640 --> 49:01.480
Just invited.

49:01.480 --> 49:02.300
Okay, beef nugs.

49:02.300 --> 49:03.140
Beef nugs.

49:03.140 --> 49:04.480
Things that aren't beef nugs.

49:04.480 --> 49:05.480
Meatballs.

49:05.480 --> 49:06.320
Meatballs.

49:06.320 --> 49:07.820
Yeah, it's just like a chicken nugget.

49:07.820 --> 49:08.660
No, it's not.

49:08.660 --> 49:10.240
It's just a little sphere of beef.

49:10.240 --> 49:11.360
That's not a beef nugget.

49:11.360 --> 49:15.360
Yeah, what about Jack Link's beef jerky beef nuggets?

49:15.360 --> 49:16.400
Oh, do you mean that shit

49:16.400 --> 49:19.960
I literally said while we were recording?

49:19.960 --> 49:22.840
You literally heard me say that's not a beef nug?

49:22.840 --> 49:24.000
What about steak?

49:24.000 --> 49:25.900
What about little chunks of steak?

49:25.900 --> 49:26.960
No, not a beef nug.

49:26.960 --> 49:28.080
What about steak fingers?

49:28.080 --> 49:32.780
You literally just said finger, not nugget.

49:33.600 --> 49:35.080
You all are fucking killing.

49:35.080 --> 49:35.920
I love you.

49:35.920 --> 49:36.920
Thank you for the support.

49:36.920 --> 49:38.480
Thank you for donating to Maximum Fun.

49:38.480 --> 49:39.400
You really help us.

49:39.400 --> 49:40.240
I don't know if you can tell,

49:40.240 --> 49:41.280
I'm recording with a new mud guard.

49:41.280 --> 49:42.400
I just bought a new mic set up.

49:42.400 --> 49:46.000
You're gonna enjoy a lot of my just fat sound pipes

49:46.000 --> 49:48.280
next week, things that aren't beef nugs.

49:48.280 --> 49:50.460
Everything, they don't exist.

49:50.460 --> 49:53.160
Somebody actually made a video of them making beef nuggets.

49:53.160 --> 49:54.560
They are the only person on earth

49:54.560 --> 49:58.320
who has cracked that fucking Dan Brown beefy da Vinci code.

49:58.320 --> 50:01.320
Everybody else stop telling me meatballs are beef nuggets.

50:01.320 --> 50:03.680
Oh God, Elizabeth Gilbert, you too.

50:03.680 --> 50:05.980
You're like the smartest person ever.

50:05.980 --> 50:08.480
I told her that I thought it was acceptable.

50:08.480 --> 50:09.800
Yeah, cause you fucking buckled

50:09.800 --> 50:11.840
under the weight of her massive brain.

50:11.840 --> 50:13.640
Star power and her charisma.

50:13.640 --> 50:14.480
I did.

50:14.480 --> 50:15.800
You're fucking killing me everybody.

50:15.800 --> 50:17.760
Stop telling me steak fingers are beef nuggets.

50:17.760 --> 50:19.440
Use your goddamn brain for a second.

50:19.440 --> 50:21.520
And quit doing it like we're the idiots.

50:21.520 --> 50:23.760
You're like, oh guys, fucking meatballs,

50:23.760 --> 50:26.680
fucking steak nuggets from Jack Links.

50:26.680 --> 50:28.320
You don't think we thought about that?

50:28.320 --> 50:29.160
You don't think we-

50:29.160 --> 50:31.720
The steak fingers are what kill me.

50:31.720 --> 50:34.240
If someone held up a chicken tender in front of you

50:34.240 --> 50:35.680
and said, this is a chicken nugget,

50:35.680 --> 50:37.680
you would punch them in their fucking snot locker.

50:37.680 --> 50:40.400
But first, you'd embarrassingly slap the chicken finger

50:40.400 --> 50:42.500
out of their hand and then slap them.

50:43.600 --> 50:45.720
I did have like three or four people actually saying like,

50:45.720 --> 50:48.720
well, actually in Ethiopian cuisine, that, okay, fine.

50:48.720 --> 50:50.100
How, but how would I know that?

50:50.100 --> 50:51.600
How would I know that?

50:51.600 --> 50:52.560
You have no way of knowing that.

50:52.560 --> 50:53.800
I have no way of knowing that.

50:53.800 --> 50:56.040
I will say the person who made the video

50:56.040 --> 50:58.680
of them like crafting steak, steak nuggets.

50:58.680 --> 50:59.780
And they like did it.

50:59.780 --> 51:02.520
They like ground that meat up to the consistency

51:02.520 --> 51:03.960
that like whatever the consistency,

51:03.960 --> 51:07.200
whatever the pasty consistency of chicken nugget meat is.

51:07.200 --> 51:08.040
They crushed that.

51:08.040 --> 51:11.080
They crushed the, whatever it is with the brining.

51:11.080 --> 51:11.920
What is it called?

51:11.920 --> 51:12.760
Dredging.

51:12.760 --> 51:13.880
Dredge shit, fried that shit up.

51:13.880 --> 51:15.660
Looked like a chicken nugget.

51:15.660 --> 51:16.960
That person's doing the Lord's work.

51:16.960 --> 51:18.920
Actually looked kind of dope.

51:18.920 --> 51:21.620
I might actually be into that, yes.

51:21.620 --> 51:23.240
Everybody else just sort of, I guess,

51:23.240 --> 51:24.900
think before you like do anything.

51:24.900 --> 51:28.360
Cause you're alive and your actions affect other people.

51:28.360 --> 51:30.400
You've caused me so much distress.

51:30.400 --> 51:33.380
I regret bringing up beef nuggets in the first place

51:33.380 --> 51:37.240
cause it's shaved years off my life, the anger.

51:37.240 --> 51:39.220
Oh, I don't know when it's going to go away either.

51:39.220 --> 51:41.060
Cause it's still very hot in my heart.

51:41.060 --> 51:42.020
We love you very much.

51:42.020 --> 51:45.880
We love you so much, but just fucking think for a second.

51:45.880 --> 51:47.120
For a second.

51:47.120 --> 51:49.460
Make some beef nuggets for your Super Bowl party.

51:49.460 --> 51:51.300
That's my new command.

51:51.300 --> 51:55.200
This is your Hail Mary to atone for the sin, so much sin.

51:55.200 --> 51:56.880
Oh my God, so much sin.

51:56.880 --> 51:58.840
Just make some beef nuggets, send me pictures.

51:58.840 --> 52:00.000
Give me a flavor review.

52:00.000 --> 52:00.880
Let me know how it turned out.

52:00.880 --> 52:02.800
But be careful, it's hot grease.

52:02.800 --> 52:04.880
Get a parent, get an adult to help you.

52:04.880 --> 52:05.720
Get an adult to help.

52:05.720 --> 52:06.880
Don't try and make this without an adult.

52:06.880 --> 52:07.720
You'll hurt yourself.

52:07.720 --> 52:09.560
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast,

52:09.560 --> 52:11.120
my brother, my brother and me.

52:11.120 --> 52:13.760
Sorry that it was a little bit angry,

52:13.760 --> 52:15.140
I guess towards you in there.

52:15.140 --> 52:16.880
You just don't know what it's like to be us.

52:16.880 --> 52:18.060
I'm trying to keep it a hundred.

52:18.060 --> 52:19.280
I'm trying to like be legit.

52:19.280 --> 52:21.120
And I don't want to disguise my feelings.

52:21.120 --> 52:22.280
I want to be the real me.

52:22.280 --> 52:24.260
And the real me is so fucking mad.

52:26.160 --> 52:28.080
But we do have a present for you.

52:28.080 --> 52:29.800
A lot of you Chicago folks were upset

52:29.800 --> 52:32.960
because you didn't get tickets to the show

52:32.960 --> 52:35.200
we're doing there on April 5th.

52:35.200 --> 52:38.440
But we've got great news for you.

52:38.440 --> 52:41.400
We are moving the whole,

52:41.400 --> 52:44.080
we're picking up the show wholesale

52:44.080 --> 52:48.120
and moving it to the Athenium Theater in Chicago.

52:48.120 --> 52:53.120
And it will seat roughly 650 more of you or so.

52:54.380 --> 52:57.840
So if you're in Chicago and don't ever,

52:57.840 --> 53:00.040
and if you don't come to the show,

53:00.040 --> 53:02.000
you can never complain about us not coming there again.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.920
We have room for literally every person who's ever listened.

53:04.920 --> 53:06.880
If you already have tickets, do not worry.

53:06.880 --> 53:08.800
They carry over, so you're already set.

53:08.800 --> 53:09.800
You don't have to worry about it.

53:09.800 --> 53:11.760
If you don't have tickets,

53:11.760 --> 53:13.780
they go on sale the 27th at noon.

53:13.780 --> 53:16.840
So when this comes out on Monday, they come out Tuesday.

53:16.840 --> 53:19.360
Noon, noon, your time Chicago, noon central.

53:19.360 --> 53:21.800
And while there are lots more tickets available,

53:21.800 --> 53:22.620
don't sit on it

53:22.620 --> 53:24.960
because we're not going to do any other shows there.

53:24.960 --> 53:27.640
And ever, this is it.

53:27.640 --> 53:28.840
We're shutting it down.

53:28.840 --> 53:29.840
This is our last one.

53:29.840 --> 53:31.280
Farewell the Chicago tour.

53:31.280 --> 53:32.780
It is assigned seating.

53:32.780 --> 53:34.600
Unlike a lot of our shows, it's assigned seats.

53:34.600 --> 53:39.440
So you'll want to get there early and to buy your tickets

53:39.440 --> 53:41.800
so you can make sure you get your whole party together.

53:41.800 --> 53:44.440
Like we said, if you already got tickets, good news.

53:44.440 --> 53:45.540
You are set.

53:45.540 --> 53:47.440
You got the primo seats.

53:47.440 --> 53:48.680
And this is not an exaggeration.

53:48.680 --> 53:51.180
The first show sold out in like seven minutes.

53:51.180 --> 53:54.380
So this is a thing where when we say don't sit on it,

53:54.380 --> 53:56.760
we mean like don't wait.

53:56.760 --> 53:58.720
It might seem like we're big timing you here.

53:58.720 --> 54:00.400
We seriously would not.

54:00.400 --> 54:02.480
We're just like, we really want everybody

54:02.480 --> 54:03.720
to be able to tell who wants to come.

54:03.720 --> 54:05.840
We were super, like it's obviously great

54:05.840 --> 54:07.520
when our shows sell out.

54:07.520 --> 54:12.160
Like my heart swells up with pride and happiness.

54:12.160 --> 54:13.320
But like when it happens that fast,

54:13.320 --> 54:14.280
man, I feel super shitty.

54:14.280 --> 54:16.320
Cause I know there's a lot of people who didn't get in.

54:16.320 --> 54:18.960
So good luck.

54:18.960 --> 54:21.880
May the fortune be ever in your favor, Hunger Games.

54:21.880 --> 54:23.480
Also, there are still tickets available

54:23.480 --> 54:24.720
for the Milwaukee show too.

54:24.720 --> 54:25.960
So if you're in Milwaukee

54:25.960 --> 54:27.840
and haven't gotten tickets for that, it's-

54:27.840 --> 54:29.920
Not a ton, it's like 70% sold out.

54:29.920 --> 54:31.620
So don't, if you've been holding off,

54:31.620 --> 54:33.080
like I wouldn't wait much longer.

54:33.080 --> 54:37.240
Bit.ly forward slash mill, M-B-M-B-A-M.

54:40.560 --> 54:42.400
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters

54:42.400 --> 54:43.360
for the use of our theme song.

54:43.360 --> 54:46.680
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

54:48.000 --> 54:48.880
Lovely album.

54:48.880 --> 54:51.880
It's a good one to just sort of, as the seasons change,

54:51.880 --> 54:56.200
to just sort of welcome spring into your heart.

54:56.200 --> 54:58.720
It's January, but that's like spring in Texas.

54:58.720 --> 55:01.080
Anyway, just listen to it and it'll make you feel good.

55:01.080 --> 55:02.280
Cause the music's good.

55:02.280 --> 55:03.200
And we still need questions

55:03.200 --> 55:05.400
for our LA and San Francisco shows.

55:05.400 --> 55:06.960
So if you're going to be at their shows

55:06.960 --> 55:08.040
and want to hear your questions,

55:08.040 --> 55:09.740
make sure that you put in the subject line,

55:09.740 --> 55:12.480
either LA show or SF show.

55:12.480 --> 55:14.000
And if you're coming to the LA show,

55:14.000 --> 55:15.240
we're going to have lots of merch.

55:15.240 --> 55:16.320
When we were here in June,

55:16.320 --> 55:19.020
there was a little bit of a mix up and we didn't have merch.

55:19.020 --> 55:21.100
Don't worry, we've got lots of merch at this show.

55:21.100 --> 55:23.280
So look forward to that.

55:23.280 --> 55:25.080
And if you're not going to be at the LA show,

55:25.080 --> 55:28.600
all of that merch is available at maxfundstore.com,

55:28.600 --> 55:29.560
except for the posters.

55:29.560 --> 55:31.980
Those are, the blue posters are only available

55:31.980 --> 55:33.120
at the live shows.

55:34.040 --> 55:36.160
You can follow us on Twitter, but don't,

55:36.160 --> 55:37.680
none of it matters.

55:37.680 --> 55:39.080
And YouTube, that's all right.

55:39.080 --> 55:41.120
That's like good content, I guess.

55:41.120 --> 55:44.280
Go to youtube.com slash N-B-N-B-A-M, right?

55:44.280 --> 55:45.120
Yes.

55:45.120 --> 55:45.960
And that's where you can find

55:45.960 --> 55:47.960
all kinds of great video content.

55:47.960 --> 55:50.560
We got a new short that Tyler Crowley did for us

55:50.560 --> 55:53.320
about Scott Jenkins and Tip of the Dragon Penis.

55:53.320 --> 55:54.520
It's pretty goddamn good.

55:54.520 --> 55:56.600
It's pretty much my favorite one so far.

55:56.600 --> 55:58.820
I still like Shitty Iron Man the best.

55:58.820 --> 56:00.880
We're on iTunes, go right and review us there.

56:00.880 --> 56:03.040
We have P.O. Boxes if you want to send us stuff.

56:03.040 --> 56:06.880
It's P.O. Box 34, Honey to West Virginia, 2576 for me.

56:06.880 --> 56:11.880
Or P.O. Box 34, 1769, Los Angeles, California, 90034

56:13.160 --> 56:14.280

56:15.300 --> 56:17.040
Go listen to the other Max Fun Shows too.

56:17.040 --> 56:19.720
We all have other shows if you like listening

56:19.720 --> 56:20.560
to our voices.

56:20.560 --> 56:22.120
We got Saw Bones, that's Justin Sidney's

56:26.040 --> 56:26.980
about the apocalypse.

56:26.980 --> 56:28.080
We do the Adventure Zone.

56:28.080 --> 56:29.280
We'll have a new episode of the Adventure Zone

56:29.280 --> 56:30.760
this Thursday, that's one that the three of us do

56:30.760 --> 56:32.040
with our dad when we play D&D.

56:32.040 --> 56:33.480
There's other shows though that are on the network

56:33.480 --> 56:35.800

56:48.160 --> 56:49.400
Did you mention Flop House?

56:49.400 --> 56:50.240
The Flop House.

56:50.240 --> 56:51.080
Because that's like my favorite podcast right now.

56:51.080 --> 56:52.760
It's really, really good.

56:52.760 --> 56:57.760
Also, the Max Fun Family is kick starting a video project

56:57.760 --> 57:01.800
called Brian and Lindsey Will Totally Eat That

57:02.800 --> 57:06.240
where Brian and Lindsey eat things and review them.

57:06.240 --> 57:07.640
And it's very funny.

57:07.640 --> 57:08.680
Check out the kick starter.

57:08.680 --> 57:10.680
You can watch sort of the pitch video for that

57:10.680 --> 57:12.120
and throw some money their way

57:12.120 --> 57:14.360
if you wanna make that video exist in the world.

57:14.360 --> 57:16.120
And if you go to Maximumfun.gov,

57:16.120 --> 57:20.400
you can find the Vor podcast, Big Gulp that Griffin hosts.

57:20.400 --> 57:22.680
That's not where Big Gulp is.

57:22.680 --> 57:25.960
Big Gulp is, I couldn't lock down the.gov.

57:25.960 --> 57:27.120
