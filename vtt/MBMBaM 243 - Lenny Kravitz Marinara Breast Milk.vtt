00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:44.400
It's a new craze, and good girls, do you want it? Just say, hey, I wanna. Just say, hey, I wanna.

00:44.400 --> 00:47.920
Hello, everybody. Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, a mean advice show for the

00:47.920 --> 00:54.000
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy, and it's time to pay the piper.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.320
I'm the middle-est brother, Travis McElroy, and I agree with the statement about the piper.

00:58.320 --> 01:03.680
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy, and look at how sticky my hands are. Gonna put them

01:03.680 --> 01:08.160
right in your pockets and get all that sweet change out. We're the sticky bandits of podcasts.

01:09.680 --> 01:16.320
It's a max fun drive. That means a long episode, some of which is begging,

01:17.120 --> 01:21.600
but a lot of it is comedy still. Well, comedy. I used air quotes.

01:21.600 --> 01:28.400
I don't like to think of it as begging as much as I like to think of it as self-serving

01:29.200 --> 01:34.720
suggestion in the fiduciary sense. I mean, is it begging when the waiter

01:34.720 --> 01:37.600
brings the check to the table, Justin? I don't think so.

01:37.600 --> 01:44.160
It's comedy check. It's time to pay the comedy check,

01:44.160 --> 01:47.680
and you all said you would split it, but then Debra had the comedy salad,

01:47.680 --> 01:52.080
but Steven had the comedy T-bone, so do you split the comedy evenly? It's hard to say.

01:53.520 --> 01:58.480
Do you tip on the comedy tax? Who knows? Listen to my brother and my brother and me.

01:58.480 --> 02:04.320
It's like going to a very expensive comedy dinner with you and a million to two million of your

02:04.320 --> 02:09.600
closest friends, and you all said you would split the check except some people died in the dash,

02:09.600 --> 02:14.960
and you just gotta assume everybody else died in the dash, and you are picking up their part of the

02:14.960 --> 02:17.680
tab. And by really fancy dinner,

02:17.680 --> 02:24.720
you mean like a ponderoso once a month. Yeah, and by millions, I meant significantly

02:24.720 --> 02:30.320
not that. And it's fun because every year we talk about like what we need the money for,

02:30.320 --> 02:34.080
and we always say like, you know, kind of general stuff like make the show better,

02:34.080 --> 02:40.000
and we have a very specific need this year. Yeah, I'm buying pizza right now as we speak.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.160
Two very specific needs. For my wife and baby, and they're like, are the donors? Payment method?

02:46.160 --> 02:53.200
Credit card? Nope. No dice there. Checking account? No, don't have it. Donors? Question mark?

02:53.200 --> 03:00.960
Donors, can you supply us with this sweet Italian podcast fuel that we call pizza?

03:02.720 --> 03:08.160
The other reason that we discussed before we started was that we need to hire a team of

03:08.160 --> 03:15.280
lawyers. Okay, we need flavor defense because everybody, everybody is constantly coming for

03:15.280 --> 03:19.920
our flavor. And we tried to mail our flavor to ourselves and then not open the envelope so that

03:19.920 --> 03:24.640
we could prove that in court. That doesn't hold up in court. Didn't hold up. Does not work. The

03:25.920 --> 03:31.680
Yahoo answers, those were funny. You know who else thought so? Everybody. Every fucking person.

03:32.240 --> 03:35.120
Everybody. And everybody else is doing sad libs now.

03:35.120 --> 03:39.280
Well, that one, that particular zeitgeist hasn't-

03:39.280 --> 03:45.120
I saw it on Comedy Bang Bang. It was on Nerdist. It was on Midnight. Everybody's doing sad libs.

03:45.120 --> 03:46.960
Hoda was busting them out.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.960
Hoda's doing some sad libs.

03:48.960 --> 03:55.360
And then today we see this, like all of a sudden Vice and NPR in the past two days

03:55.360 --> 03:57.360
have both gotten on haunted dolls.

03:58.560 --> 04:00.640
I feel like I've heard about that somewhere before.

04:00.640 --> 04:07.520
Yeah, I know. And people send us these links gleefully like, guess it's catching on,

04:07.520 --> 04:13.200
and I see those links and I think, fuck. That's now a thing we can't do anymore because now it's

04:13.200 --> 04:13.600
a thing.

04:14.480 --> 04:15.520
You see those links as-

04:15.520 --> 04:18.640
You know we're not getting a cut of that? We don't get a slice of that.

04:19.200 --> 04:22.480
You see those links as negative food in your baby's tummy.

04:22.480 --> 04:28.400
Are they stealing from us? No. Is it just that we've holistically, as a culture,

04:28.400 --> 04:33.040
like, the time has come for haunted dolls to be widely known and we just like,

04:33.600 --> 04:35.680
it was so amazing that we couldn't keep it to ourselves.

04:36.560 --> 04:40.560
Does Terry Gross listen to my brother and my brother and me? She's chomping our flavor 24-7.

04:40.560 --> 04:43.520
Occam's Razor. Occam's Razor.

04:43.520 --> 04:48.880
Occam's Razor is that Terry Gross, TG, is chomping our Flav 24-7,

04:48.880 --> 04:53.760
and we need a team of flavor defense lawyers to get her into jail.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.640
We need to get the firm of Flav and Flav.

04:56.640 --> 04:59.520
Yeah, to protect our Flav.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.480
I want her breathing stale air in a jail cell.

05:05.520 --> 05:07.120
No more fresh air for you, TG.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.280
So it's Maximum Fun Drive every year we-

05:11.280 --> 05:13.600
What is that? Can you explain what that means to people who haven't-

05:13.600 --> 05:17.680
I'm about to if you can just wait, Chris Farley voice.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.520
Every year. Okay, let me back up.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.280
You have forgotten what we do.

05:23.280 --> 05:28.080
We're part of the Maximum Fun Network, which is a network of beloved podcasts.

05:28.080 --> 05:30.800
Us, Jordan and Jesse, go stop podcasting yourself.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.880
New additions like Baby Geniuses.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.040
The Flophouse.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.880
Flophouse. You know, so many others.

05:37.920 --> 05:40.560
We're part of this podcast network, and every year, once a year,

05:40.560 --> 05:42.080
we come to you, the listeners, and say,

05:42.080 --> 05:47.680
hey, can we have some support for the stuff that we're doing, right?

05:48.480 --> 05:49.520
That makes sense so far.

05:49.520 --> 05:52.160
And then that's basically it.

05:52.160 --> 05:53.760
If you've been enjoying the shows,

05:55.360 --> 05:57.840
you know, we ask that you maybe give a little bit,

05:57.840 --> 05:59.920
a monthly donation to help support the network,

06:00.400 --> 06:03.600
and in return, you're going to get a ton of really great stuff.

06:04.400 --> 06:05.920
We'll be telling you about this later.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.680
We'll tell you about all the cool stuff you can get.

06:07.680 --> 06:12.400
There's a lot of cool stuff, and we will tell you how to donate.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.880
It's maximumfun.org slash donate, spoiler alert.

06:14.880 --> 06:16.880
But we'll be breaking in later to tell you about that.

06:16.880 --> 06:20.960
For now, though, let's get on with the show.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.240
Hey, I'm inspired, Griffin.

06:24.240 --> 06:25.360
I'm inspired.

06:25.360 --> 06:26.880
Let's start with the Yahoo this time.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.000
Whoa!

06:28.000 --> 06:29.760
I know, right?

06:29.760 --> 06:30.640
Whoa!

06:30.640 --> 06:32.080
Is it opposite day?

06:32.720 --> 06:34.480
Let's start with the Yahoo this time.

06:34.480 --> 06:35.360
This is fun.

06:35.360 --> 06:36.800
This is fun precedented.

06:36.800 --> 06:39.440
Also, you don't have the email open, do you?

06:39.440 --> 06:42.400
I'm trying to finish ordering the pizza.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.160
You're fucking going on a pizza adventure.

06:44.160 --> 06:44.640
No way.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.080
I'm going to sit here obstinately.

06:46.080 --> 06:50.560
Let me zest my baby for a second while you do your dumbass show.

06:50.560 --> 06:53.280
You zest your baby on your own goddamn time.

06:53.280 --> 06:53.760
Yeah, it is.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.160
That's my favorite Dr. Spock book, by the way.

06:56.160 --> 06:57.760
It's post 5 p.m.

06:57.760 --> 06:59.440
I am on my own goddamn time.

06:59.440 --> 07:01.280
I'm trying to feed my baby.

07:01.280 --> 07:04.480
Can you please just repeat a delicious pizza?

07:04.480 --> 07:06.640
I'm trying to get my baby delicious.

07:07.520 --> 07:10.320
Listen, we're trying to get this baby flavor blasted in here,

07:10.320 --> 07:12.000
and Griffin's copying your swag.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.800
Do you know how much focus it takes to be on the Pizza Hut website

07:14.800 --> 07:16.720
and order a full baby bottle of marinara?

07:19.760 --> 07:23.200
Justin, I thought that you guys were breastfeeding marinara sauce.

07:27.520 --> 07:30.960
So it's genetically, it just didn't pan out for us.

07:30.960 --> 07:31.840
How about a Yahoo?

07:32.480 --> 07:35.600
Can I tell you the best part about the pizza hut.com experience?

07:35.600 --> 07:38.800
At the end of the ordering process, step number three is,

07:40.160 --> 07:44.480
do you want this order as soon as possible, or do you want this on a future time?

07:44.480 --> 07:46.560
Like, hi, I'm getting pizza.

07:46.560 --> 07:51.280
I am anticipating that in three hours time, I will be a hungy boy.

07:51.280 --> 07:55.360
That's not, that's like, that is so crazy to think that anyone,

07:55.360 --> 07:58.400
you order pizza when you have nothing left to lose.

07:58.400 --> 08:02.560
Like, it's so crazy to me that anyone would like get out in front of this.

08:02.560 --> 08:02.880
Here in a few hours, I'm gonna order pizza.

08:02.880 --> 08:05.600
Can you do it three days time and say like,

08:05.600 --> 08:08.880
bring me a pizza on Thursday when I'm least expecting it.

08:08.880 --> 08:11.440
All right, Griffin, give me, I have the questions now, by the way.

08:11.440 --> 08:14.880
The pizza has been ordered, our national tragedy has been averted.

08:14.880 --> 08:15.120
Okay.

08:15.920 --> 08:16.720
Hit me.

08:16.720 --> 08:18.960
This Yahoo was sent in by Ashley Shannon.

08:18.960 --> 08:19.520
Thank you, Ashley.

08:19.520 --> 08:22.320
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Shades, who asks,

08:23.600 --> 08:26.240
Wendy's drive-through service time, too fast.

08:27.760 --> 08:31.360
Weirdly timed, considering our previous conversation.

08:31.920 --> 08:36.000
Is it possible for a drive-through service to be too fast?

08:36.000 --> 08:38.960
I went to a Wendy's restaurant and had forgotten,

08:38.960 --> 08:41.280
because I haven't been in about one and a half years.

08:41.840 --> 08:46.320
How do you go that long without some sweet Wendy's in your mouth?

08:46.320 --> 08:48.640
How fast the drive-through service is?

08:48.640 --> 08:52.400
Is it odd that as soon as you get to the pickup window,

08:52.400 --> 08:56.560
your meal is ready so fast that you don't have to stop,

08:57.120 --> 08:59.520
step on the brake, just fucking chuck it in.

08:59.520 --> 08:59.840
What?

09:00.720 --> 09:05.840
Give me a crispy chicken hand grenade right in the window,

09:05.840 --> 09:06.960
right in the driver's side.

09:06.960 --> 09:09.840
And on top of this, the cashier at the first window

09:09.840 --> 09:13.040
oddly knew what denomination of money I was going to give her

09:13.040 --> 09:16.720
and had the exact change ready when I got to the window.

09:16.720 --> 09:17.440
Wait, okay.

09:17.440 --> 09:19.360
It's spinning out of control.

09:19.360 --> 09:20.320
This is ridiculous.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.280
Is it weird that I go to a prescient?

09:23.920 --> 09:25.760
We go to a precog Wendy's.

09:26.960 --> 09:31.520
They have three red-headed teenage girls in tanks,

09:31.520 --> 09:35.600
and they just, every few minutes or so, their eyes pop open.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.120
He's going to want the nugs.

09:37.120 --> 09:38.240
He's going to get the nugs.

09:38.240 --> 09:39.760
Spicy chicken deluxe.

09:41.840 --> 09:43.920
And then every so often, one of the three will be like,

09:43.920 --> 09:45.840
it's probably a junior bacon cheeseburger.

09:45.840 --> 09:46.560
It's like, no.

09:46.560 --> 09:48.800
No, no, delete that.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.200
Looks like we've got a Hyundai Elantra,

09:51.200 --> 09:53.040
pulling around 2003 Hyundai Elantra,

09:53.040 --> 09:56.800
and here comes a little brown ball down the machine.

09:56.800 --> 09:57.120
Okay.

09:57.920 --> 09:59.040
He wants diarrhea.

10:00.640 --> 10:02.080
Surprise, that's every brown ball.

10:02.080 --> 10:03.760
That's all of them.

10:03.760 --> 10:04.320
I get it.

10:04.320 --> 10:07.520
Like, it not only freaks me out because of witchcraft,

10:07.520 --> 10:13.040
obviously, it sort of shatters the illusion

10:13.840 --> 10:18.320
that this food is being, at the very least,

10:18.320 --> 10:20.080
resuscitated to order.

10:20.800 --> 10:21.360
You know what I mean?

10:21.360 --> 10:23.600
Like, I am under, I am not expecting-

10:23.600 --> 10:27.280
Somebody gets the petals out on your junior bacon cheeseburger.

10:27.280 --> 10:28.080
Like, clear.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.680
No, no, hold on.

10:29.680 --> 10:32.320
Do you guys expect that the person working at Wendy's,

10:32.320 --> 10:33.680
like, when a burger's ordered, you're like,

10:33.680 --> 10:34.320
you know what?

10:34.320 --> 10:36.640
I know what I was taught at Wendy's U.

10:36.640 --> 10:38.640
I'm going to reinvent the burger on this one.

10:38.640 --> 10:40.880
I'm going to need a solid 20 to 30 minutes.

10:40.880 --> 10:42.400
No, but let's split the difference.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.800
I also don't think there's any char grilling going on.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.560
What if the meat is the bun?

10:46.560 --> 10:48.320
You're crazy, Randall.

10:48.320 --> 10:50.800
Well, that's how, I mean, that's been like KFC

10:50.800 --> 10:53.280
and Taco Bell's basic MMO.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.200
Just let crazy Randall do whatever.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.400
Yeah, crazy Randall like,

10:56.400 --> 10:58.880
oh god, a bunch of taco, but shell's all cheese

10:58.880 --> 11:01.520
and the meat's all cheese and it's cheesy all through.

11:01.520 --> 11:03.840
It came to me in a flavor dream.

11:03.840 --> 11:06.400
Don't make, you can't cook anything with KFC

11:06.400 --> 11:07.200
with a hole in it,

11:07.200 --> 11:09.200
because Randall will try to stuff a potato in there.

11:09.200 --> 11:09.680
Yep.

11:09.680 --> 11:10.180
Yep.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.400
I don't want,

11:12.400 --> 11:14.960
I'm not pretending that there is an artisanal,

11:15.680 --> 11:17.840
like, level of craftsmanship going on,

11:17.840 --> 11:21.360
but when it's instantaneous, it just,

11:21.360 --> 11:23.600
I can't, I can't get over that.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.560
It's too fast.

11:24.560 --> 11:25.760
The food is too fast.

11:25.760 --> 11:27.040
Do you think it's not so much,

11:27.040 --> 11:28.720
it's not about the food quality for me.

11:28.720 --> 11:31.680
I just don't like the idea that I'm not unoriginal.

11:31.680 --> 11:34.240
Like, I kind of like them to have to make it special for me.

11:34.240 --> 11:35.040
Well, that's what it is.

11:35.040 --> 11:36.640
Is it kind of the thing where it's like,

11:36.640 --> 11:37.840
no like sentence,

11:37.840 --> 11:40.560
no combination of words has ever not been said

11:40.560 --> 11:41.360
and they said like,

11:41.360 --> 11:44.320
we've said so much that there's no new way to say anything.

11:44.320 --> 11:47.040
Like, everyone's ordered everything from this Wendy's

11:47.040 --> 11:49.200
and that's how they even know like the change.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.720
It's like, okay, it was 13.81.

11:50.720 --> 11:51.840
He's gonna give me a 20.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.160
Like, I've just got a drawer set out

11:54.160 --> 11:57.680
with like $6.19 to hand back to him.

11:57.680 --> 12:00.000
Lenny Kravitz marinara breast milk.

12:01.520 --> 12:02.160
That's been said.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.120
That was in-

12:03.120 --> 12:04.000
No, that's garbage.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.200
That was fucking it.

12:05.200 --> 12:09.760
That was the first time he birthed that concept into being.

12:09.760 --> 12:12.160
The bigger concern is how furious is the food?

12:15.280 --> 12:18.240
That would have been a good thing to say 17 minutes ago.

12:18.240 --> 12:19.360
Griffin, did you edit that in

12:19.360 --> 12:20.960
to the first time you said it was too fast?

12:21.520 --> 12:23.440
Yeah, and what I'll do is I'll also take

12:23.440 --> 12:25.440
Lenny Kravitz marinara breast milk

12:25.440 --> 12:27.440
and make that be the first thing anybody hears

12:27.440 --> 12:28.640
when they turn on the episode.

12:28.640 --> 12:29.280
Okay.

12:29.280 --> 12:30.240
I'm gonna actually edit that

12:30.240 --> 12:32.400
into the beginning of every episode we've ever done.

12:32.400 --> 12:35.120
All 243 episodes all gonna kick off.

12:35.120 --> 12:35.680
It's gonna be-

12:35.680 --> 12:39.440
The Lenny Kravitz breast milk reverberated back through time.

12:39.440 --> 12:42.480
Yeah, preceding Bob Balls opening monologue.

12:42.480 --> 12:44.880
We're gonna have a Lenny Kravitz marinara breast milk

12:44.880 --> 12:47.440
just as like a teaser of things to come.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.040
And now the singularity has occurred

12:49.040 --> 12:50.000
and now we can move on.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.240
I got a question.

12:52.240 --> 12:54.960
My friends and I have developed a bit of an unofficial rotation

12:54.960 --> 12:58.640
for hosting dinner get togethers. They're always a blast.

12:58.640 --> 13:02.080
My friends are all great hosts and awesome guests

13:02.080 --> 13:04.640
and never show up without some food or booze in tow.

13:05.200 --> 13:09.040
It worked out perfectly until one couple invited everyone over

13:09.040 --> 13:10.880
and sent out the message that rather than contributing

13:10.880 --> 13:12.640
any alcohol or food, everyone who attends

13:12.640 --> 13:14.560
should just pay them 15 bucks a piece.

13:14.560 --> 13:14.960
What the fuck?

13:14.960 --> 13:16.160
They would take care of all the drinks

13:16.160 --> 13:17.520
and food stuffs themselves.

13:17.520 --> 13:20.160
I think this is some ghoulish shit.

13:20.160 --> 13:21.120
If I wanted to conduct-

13:21.120 --> 13:23.600
Or some goulash shit if they have goulash.

13:23.600 --> 13:26.960
I think these are the high quality ghoulish

13:26.960 --> 13:28.160
you're paying for, Derek.

13:28.160 --> 13:31.680
That would be $30, please.

13:31.680 --> 13:32.320
Yeah, bad news.

13:32.320 --> 13:33.520
Just by listening to that goof,

13:33.520 --> 13:34.960
you don't have to give us another quarter.

13:35.600 --> 13:38.080
If I wanted to conduct a business transaction

13:38.080 --> 13:40.720
for my dinner, I'd go to a restaurant.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.200
Something just skews me out about forking over cash

13:43.200 --> 13:45.120
to my friends for the meal they prepared.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.320
Am I crazy?

13:47.200 --> 13:49.600
That's from neurotic guests in the Midwest.

13:49.600 --> 13:50.720
Of course you're not crazy.

13:50.720 --> 13:54.000
Your friend is charging you tickets to enter their home.

13:55.760 --> 13:57.840
Yeah, this is just across the board terrible.

13:59.280 --> 14:01.280
This is a pot fuck is what it is.

14:01.280 --> 14:02.960
You're getting screwed over.

14:04.240 --> 14:04.880
It sucks.

14:04.880 --> 14:09.440
It's terrible because it is literally taking the idea

14:09.440 --> 14:11.440
of a potluck party, which I adore.

14:13.840 --> 14:16.080
It is maybe my number one sign of adulthood.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.920
It is my favorite thing.

14:17.920 --> 14:20.800
It's like, ooh, I wonder what Garrett's going to bring.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.040
Oh, last time he brought some kimchi.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.560
It was very exotic and exciting.

14:24.560 --> 14:26.240
I can't wait to see what he brings in this.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.640
That is my favorite thing because it's not only

14:30.640 --> 14:33.360
you get to eat a bunch of really great food most of the time.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.960
It's that you get to cook and you get to prepare.

14:36.960 --> 14:42.080
And it's such a way of showing that you care about people.

14:42.080 --> 14:46.560
And I don't know, it's such a wonderful,

14:46.560 --> 14:49.680
warm friendship feeling to have all this food

14:49.680 --> 14:51.680
that everybody's prepared for each other.

14:51.680 --> 14:56.000
And this is literally the goddamn diametric opposite of that.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.320
Okay, all right, counterpoint.

15:00.160 --> 15:05.040
One counterpoint is what if you're a picky eater

15:05.040 --> 15:08.320
and your friends always make a bunch of just mayonnaise-y shit?

15:08.320 --> 15:11.120
Just like they're mayonnaise boys through and through

15:11.120 --> 15:12.800
and they put mayonnaise in everything.

15:12.800 --> 15:15.120
And like different variations of salads.

15:15.120 --> 15:16.800
Like what if you just hate the things they make

15:16.800 --> 15:17.920
and you're like, you know what?

15:17.920 --> 15:19.680
I'm hosting this at my house.

15:19.680 --> 15:22.960
I'm gonna, I'm gonna not have,

15:22.960 --> 15:25.520
I'm not gonna eat some mayonnaise today.

15:25.520 --> 15:26.560
Not today.

15:26.560 --> 15:28.080
No mayonnaise soup for me today.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.760
No mayo, no mayo.

15:29.760 --> 15:33.120
Joshua, that will be $15.

15:33.120 --> 15:35.120
And I will take that mayonnaise soup you brought

15:35.120 --> 15:37.040
because I guess you didn't read the email close enough

15:37.040 --> 15:38.800
and I'm gonna dump it right down the sink.

15:38.800 --> 15:40.320
Oh, you don't have $15?

15:40.320 --> 15:41.280
You can go home.

15:41.280 --> 15:41.760
You can go right now.

15:41.760 --> 15:44.320
They also may have just not wanted to like coordinate.

15:44.320 --> 15:47.040
Like kimchi's great, but then there's that one party

15:47.040 --> 15:48.640
where everybody brought kimchi.

15:48.640 --> 15:49.760
It's like, do we have enough?

15:50.720 --> 15:53.120
Is there other kinds of kimchi that people should bring?

15:53.120 --> 15:54.320
Or, or.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.640
But Justin, I would say that the social contract then

15:56.640 --> 15:59.360
is like if you are just inviting people over

15:59.360 --> 16:00.720
to eat dinner at your house,

16:01.280 --> 16:03.760
you're volunteering to cook dinner for everyone.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.440
Like, I don't think you get to say like,

16:05.440 --> 16:07.760
hey, I wanna have everyone over and cook for you guys

16:07.760 --> 16:09.360
and also charge you for it.

16:09.360 --> 16:10.800
Like, no, hold on.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.880
Either you invite everyone to bring a dish

16:12.880 --> 16:14.640
or you're cooking for everybody.

16:14.640 --> 16:18.240
Like you don't get to charge people admission to your house.

16:18.240 --> 16:19.680
What if the thing they wanna get

16:19.680 --> 16:22.320
is really bodacious and expensive?

16:22.320 --> 16:26.080
Like ancient grain fed chicken nuggets.

16:26.080 --> 16:27.520
Now I would say that if that's the thing,

16:27.520 --> 16:29.680
if you're like, hey, we wanna host a luau.

16:29.680 --> 16:31.520
Do you guys wanna like go in on a pig?

16:31.520 --> 16:33.520
A suckling pig and also where do you buy those

16:33.520 --> 16:34.400
and how do you cook them?

16:34.400 --> 16:35.920
Then that's a thing.

16:35.920 --> 16:36.960
That's a deal.

16:36.960 --> 16:38.240
If it's like Thanksgiving

16:38.240 --> 16:39.920
and you're all going in on the turkey,

16:39.920 --> 16:41.120
yeah, that makes sense.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.160
But just the idea of like,

16:42.160 --> 16:43.520
we're all gonna have everyone over

16:43.520 --> 16:44.800
and we made a pasta dish,

16:44.800 --> 16:47.360
that'll be 15 goddamn American dollars, please.

16:47.360 --> 16:48.960
Well, then the other problem with that

16:48.960 --> 16:53.120
is you've just entered like a value equation

16:53.120 --> 16:54.320
into the food that you made.

16:54.320 --> 16:56.160
Oh, it should be like you get to pay

16:56.160 --> 16:58.160
how much you think the dinner was worth.

16:58.160 --> 16:59.760
Or $7.

16:59.760 --> 17:00.960
That's great, Daniel.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.320
Thank you so much.

17:02.320 --> 17:03.600
Here's an idea.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.840
Instead of $15 for this pasta dish

17:05.840 --> 17:08.000
that you've cooked up for them at your house,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.400
you can have them pay $99

17:10.400 --> 17:12.480
and then for the next six weeks,

17:12.480 --> 17:13.520
they can come to your house

17:13.520 --> 17:15.520
and have as much pasta and soda

17:15.520 --> 17:18.160
for themselves and a friend as they want.

17:18.160 --> 17:19.200
That sounds like a terrific deal.

17:19.200 --> 17:22.160
Because if you're gonna open a goddamn Olive Garden,

17:22.160 --> 17:23.600
then fucking do it right.

17:24.320 --> 17:25.280
No, you're not crazy.

17:25.280 --> 17:27.040
That was not a cool thing for them to do.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.280
If they wanna volunteer to cook everything,

17:29.280 --> 17:30.000
that's the deal.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.120
Like I've had lots of friends

17:31.120 --> 17:34.080
where it's like we all took turns hosting dinner parties,

17:34.640 --> 17:35.760
as opposed to a potluck,

17:35.760 --> 17:37.680
like we're gonna do a full on dinner party

17:37.680 --> 17:39.120
and invite our friends over.

17:39.120 --> 17:39.600
Cool.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.840
That's a totally adult awesome thing to do.

17:41.840 --> 17:43.840
But the adult awesome part of that is saying,

17:43.840 --> 17:46.880
I've got to a point where I can provide for my friends.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.600
Like not like I've got to a point

17:49.600 --> 17:51.200
where I can charge you for friendship.

17:52.320 --> 17:54.560
Who are these goddamn monsters

17:54.560 --> 17:57.120
who have not only ruined the very idea

17:57.120 --> 17:58.960
of a potluck forever for everybody,

17:59.840 --> 18:02.720
but also want to spend their entire evening

18:02.720 --> 18:04.400
fucking managing their accounts?

18:04.400 --> 18:07.840
Who are collecting money from friends for anything

18:07.840 --> 18:08.800
is the worst.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.800
So you only do it for big, big, big shit,

18:10.800 --> 18:12.880
like group vacations and shit,

18:12.880 --> 18:16.240
not for fucking fettuccine Alfredo.

18:17.280 --> 18:18.320
Yeah, that's a horrible thing.

18:18.320 --> 18:19.440
I could see the worst.

18:19.440 --> 18:22.400
I could see where maybe they had a really misguided thought

18:22.400 --> 18:24.400
of like, we're gonna save everyone the trouble

18:24.400 --> 18:26.720
of coming up with something to cook and cooking it.

18:26.720 --> 18:28.560
And we'll take it off their hands

18:28.560 --> 18:29.680
and cut out the middleman,

18:30.320 --> 18:32.720
except that like that ruins the fun.

18:32.720 --> 18:33.440
That's like saying,

18:33.440 --> 18:34.720
I'm gonna have a birthday party,

18:34.720 --> 18:35.680
but we're not gonna have cake

18:35.680 --> 18:37.200
because I don't want you all to be so exhausted

18:37.200 --> 18:38.640
after eating all that cake.

18:38.640 --> 18:40.080
Like, oh, you've missed the point.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.480
I'm livid now.

18:45.360 --> 18:47.760
I haven't been to a dinner party I think ever.

18:48.640 --> 18:49.200
What?

18:49.200 --> 18:49.440
What?

18:49.440 --> 18:50.560
I don't think I have.

18:50.560 --> 18:52.240
I can't believe that's true.

18:52.240 --> 18:53.520
You're an American adult.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.640
Huntington's not really built for that kind of thing.

18:56.640 --> 18:58.560
You need to throw one too sweet, sir.

18:59.600 --> 19:00.000
Who?

19:00.000 --> 19:00.480
Who?

19:00.480 --> 19:01.280
With who?

19:01.280 --> 19:01.680
I don't know.

19:01.680 --> 19:02.640
You know people.

19:02.640 --> 19:04.480
Do you not have friends, Justin?

19:04.480 --> 19:06.160
Hey, time out from the podcast real quick.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.800
Hey, a quick T.O. for a fucking

19:08.800 --> 19:10.320
St. Elmo's fire intervention

19:10.320 --> 19:11.760
with our oldest brother.

19:11.760 --> 19:12.320
What's going on?

19:12.320 --> 19:13.200
I have a baby.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.720
That's my best friend.

19:14.720 --> 19:15.280
No, well.

19:18.080 --> 19:19.840
Like, that's all I have anymore.

19:19.840 --> 19:20.800
I just have a baby.

19:21.520 --> 19:22.400
I don't have friends.

19:23.760 --> 19:24.720
What are you talking about?

19:24.720 --> 19:26.480
What happens at a dinner party?

19:26.480 --> 19:27.120
What am I-

19:27.120 --> 19:29.120
Hey, hey guys, quick question.

19:29.120 --> 19:29.840
What am love?

19:29.840 --> 19:30.800
What am love?

19:30.800 --> 19:31.840
Do you guys want to know why you're out here?

19:31.840 --> 19:32.400
Why?

19:32.400 --> 19:32.800
Yes.

19:32.800 --> 19:33.280
Wow.

19:33.280 --> 19:34.320
Really burning through them.

19:34.320 --> 19:34.960
All right.

19:34.960 --> 19:38.320
This Yahoo was sent in by Nathaniel Claxton.

19:38.320 --> 19:40.160
That's a fucking super sick name.

19:40.160 --> 19:40.800
Thank you, Nathaniel.

19:40.800 --> 19:41.200
That's awesome.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.920
It's by Yahoo Answers user Diamond, who asks,

19:45.760 --> 19:48.560
I think I am in love with my guardian angel.

19:48.560 --> 19:48.800
Oh.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.080
Interpret it any way you'd like.

19:52.080 --> 19:52.720
I will.

19:52.720 --> 19:53.200
Thank you.

19:53.200 --> 19:53.920
I don't need your permission.

19:53.920 --> 19:55.440
Thank you for giving me that option.

19:56.240 --> 19:58.080
But I've always believed that every person

19:58.080 --> 19:59.440
has a guardian angel.

19:59.440 --> 20:00.880
If you would like to disagree,

20:00.880 --> 20:03.280
that's fine too, but these are just my opinions.

20:03.280 --> 20:05.360
I'll mention a few things about my angel.

20:05.360 --> 20:06.800
His name is Eric.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.000
Well, hold on.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.320
Hold on, Diamond.

20:10.880 --> 20:13.520
I don't want to poke holes too early in your argument.

20:15.200 --> 20:17.040
This is my angel, Eric Estrada.

20:17.680 --> 20:20.240
He often appears to me with messy brown hair,

20:20.240 --> 20:23.280
deep brown eyes, very tall, and a toned body.

20:23.280 --> 20:24.240
Oh, Eric.

20:24.240 --> 20:27.280
He says he's just my neighbor, but I know the truth.

20:27.280 --> 20:28.400
Of course he looks good.

20:28.400 --> 20:29.360
He's an angel.

20:29.360 --> 20:30.800
Have you seen Michael?

20:30.800 --> 20:32.560
Because that movie starred John Travolta.

20:33.440 --> 20:36.000
He has saved me from danger numerous times.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.760
I can't tell which of this is you

20:37.760 --> 20:38.960
and which of this is the person.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.240
Did the person mention Michael?

20:40.960 --> 20:41.760
No, I did.

20:41.760 --> 20:44.480
He has saved me from danger numerous times.

20:44.480 --> 20:46.960
Again, this is still me talking about John Travolta.

20:50.800 --> 20:51.520
He has saved me.

20:51.520 --> 20:54.880
Eric has saved this question asker from danger numerous times.

20:54.880 --> 20:56.800
And I can be a very clumsy person.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.640
I was in an accident just over four years ago.

20:58.640 --> 21:00.320
I apparently passed out for 20 minutes

21:00.320 --> 21:02.400
and I came out without a scratch or any kind of pain.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.960
My truck rolled over six times and it was completely totaled.

21:04.960 --> 21:06.800
I came out without a scratch.

21:06.800 --> 21:10.240
Another incident happened when I was with a friend of mine.

21:10.240 --> 21:11.360
He was driving us on the highway

21:11.360 --> 21:12.320
and we were in the far left lane.

21:12.320 --> 21:14.400
A transporter truck almost collided into us

21:14.400 --> 21:16.320
but swerved into the other side of the road.

21:16.320 --> 21:18.880
There would have been a split second left until he hit us.

21:18.880 --> 21:21.520
I almost died as an infant when my mother was giving birth to me.

21:21.520 --> 21:24.560
I was also almost involved in a plane crash in 2010

21:24.560 --> 21:26.160
right before my car accident.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.920
He tells me that he's always there for me when I'm alone

21:27.920 --> 21:31.040
and I feel a strong protective and loving force whenever he's near.

21:31.040 --> 21:31.680
Oh no.

21:31.680 --> 21:34.240
I always feel arms wrapped around me when I sleep.

21:34.240 --> 21:37.600
Sometimes we even travel together in my dreams.

21:37.600 --> 21:40.320
He takes me to different countries that I've never been to

21:40.320 --> 21:42.720
because I have always wanted to travel the world.

21:42.720 --> 21:43.120
Oh no.

21:43.840 --> 21:45.920
I was planning on writing a book about him

21:45.920 --> 21:47.680
so that everyone can know how wonderful he is.

21:47.680 --> 21:50.240
There is a part of me though that can't help but love him

21:50.240 --> 21:51.360
on a romantic level.

21:51.360 --> 21:52.560
I want to know what your thoughts on this are.

21:52.560 --> 21:55.440
Eric always says to keep that part to myself.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.040
He's watching out for me always.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.280
I want to know what your opinions on angels are

21:59.280 --> 22:01.120
even if you do not believe in them.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.080
Thank you, Diamond.

22:02.080 --> 22:03.680
Is the argument with guardian angels

22:03.680 --> 22:05.600
that when something bad does happen,

22:05.600 --> 22:07.280
it's like, well, it could have been way worse.

22:08.640 --> 22:11.280
They should have gotten there a little earlier, you mean?

22:11.280 --> 22:13.200
Well, it's just like, I stubbed my toe

22:13.200 --> 22:14.240
and it's like, thanks, guardian angel.

22:14.240 --> 22:16.240
And the guardian angel's like, if I hadn't been here,

22:16.240 --> 22:18.240
the chair would have fallen over and broken your neck.

22:18.240 --> 22:19.600
And it's like, what?

22:19.600 --> 22:21.360
That's a lazy guardian angeling.

22:21.360 --> 22:24.560
You're suggesting that every injury anybody has ever suffered

22:24.560 --> 22:27.200
is a lessened version.

22:27.840 --> 22:29.200
That just doesn't make any sense.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.920
Well, otherwise, it's the guardian angel going,

22:31.920 --> 22:34.560
oh, sorry, I was looking over there.

22:34.560 --> 22:35.840
I didn't see the chair.

22:35.840 --> 22:37.120
That one's on me, you guys.

22:37.120 --> 22:39.200
I was watching angels in the outfield again

22:39.200 --> 22:41.760
and I, okay, so the car thing, right.

22:41.760 --> 22:44.400
If the angel was there and he was like the only one

22:44.400 --> 22:46.400
that helped protect you in a car wreck,

22:46.400 --> 22:49.040
why couldn't the angel have come like a minute earlier

22:49.040 --> 22:50.800
and just been like, hey, slow down?

22:50.800 --> 22:52.000
Yeah, hey, look out.

22:53.040 --> 22:53.680
Slow down and look out.

22:53.680 --> 22:56.720
Because he talks to you other times, apparently.

22:56.720 --> 22:58.480
Why was he so mum and things like that?

22:58.480 --> 22:59.840
Why wasn't he like, you should merge?

23:00.400 --> 23:01.200
Well, okay.

23:01.200 --> 23:04.400
And when you're a baby, like, can I just say something?

23:04.400 --> 23:06.480
There are many things about this question

23:06.480 --> 23:08.160
that I find upsetting.

23:08.800 --> 23:15.840
Number one among them is that an angel was there

23:15.840 --> 23:19.040
in the delivery room when your mom was giving birth to you

23:19.040 --> 23:22.720
and he was like, hey, mama, this one's for me.

23:22.720 --> 23:27.120
Dibs, dibs.

23:27.120 --> 23:29.120
And sometimes he spoons you.

23:29.760 --> 23:31.440
Hey, everybody, Michael.

23:31.440 --> 23:34.080
Nicholas Cage from City of Angels, listen up.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.040
Dibs.

23:35.040 --> 23:36.160
Dibs wasn't mine.

23:36.720 --> 23:37.920
I'm gonna spoon him.

23:37.920 --> 23:38.800
I'm gonna play a long game with this one.

23:38.800 --> 23:41.920
I don't want no strings to tie me down, you know what I mean?

23:41.920 --> 23:43.360
I'm not a one woman angel.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.880
Christopher Lloyd, not from angels in the outfield,

23:46.880 --> 23:48.160
just the real Christopher Lloyd.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.840
Just in general, back off.

23:49.840 --> 23:51.280
Keep your hands, this one's mine.

23:51.280 --> 23:52.080
It's mine.

23:52.080 --> 23:54.960
Listen, we're ignoring the obvious truth

23:55.680 --> 24:00.720
and that is if you go to Ponderosa Steakhouse

24:02.080 --> 24:06.000
and you go there every day for every day of your life,

24:06.000 --> 24:08.320
you're not gonna get the same service every time

24:08.320 --> 24:10.000
because there's gonna be some variability

24:10.000 --> 24:13.280
in the skill of the Ponderosa waiters.

24:13.280 --> 24:14.160
They're waiting on you.

24:14.160 --> 24:16.720
I don't know why I picked this very specific example,

24:18.080 --> 24:18.560
but I got some.

24:18.560 --> 24:20.400
Especially since I'm not sure Ponderosa has waiters,

24:20.400 --> 24:21.040
but go on.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.240
I got the rosa on the brain.

24:24.160 --> 24:26.640
We are ignoring the fact.

24:26.640 --> 24:27.920
Not every person.

24:28.480 --> 24:30.880
If every person in the world had the same job,

24:30.880 --> 24:34.400
there would be a very large range of skill.

24:34.400 --> 24:36.960
There would be a variety of talent at that job.

24:36.960 --> 24:39.680
What I'm saying is that some angels are probably shitty.

24:40.240 --> 24:42.800
So you're saying we're looking like a goof has gotten Eric

24:42.800 --> 24:44.560
and Derek situation and it's like,

24:44.560 --> 24:47.840
Eric is a good guardian angel and save you from a car crash.

24:47.840 --> 24:51.280
Derek is a bad guardian angel unless you get kidnapped.

24:51.280 --> 24:55.360
Eric, I think maybe sleeps in maybe

24:55.360 --> 24:58.080
and he misses some stuff from time to time.

24:59.200 --> 25:02.400
But he does, I would say an average job,

25:02.400 --> 25:04.240
but God damn is he toned.

25:04.800 --> 25:05.920
Holy shit.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.360
When he lacks in dependability,

25:07.360 --> 25:10.000
he more than makes up in fuckability.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.440
I'm just gonna assume that this woman

25:11.440 --> 25:13.680
never watched City of Angels with Nicolas Cage

25:13.680 --> 25:19.040
because that put me off of angel romance pretty much Kaiser permanently.

25:21.440 --> 25:24.240
It's basically the worst ending to any movie ever.

25:25.280 --> 25:26.560
I don't know if you watched that.

25:26.560 --> 25:29.120
I'm assuming you probably would watch this film.

25:29.120 --> 25:33.520
There aren't a lot of cinematic bomb bonds

25:33.520 --> 25:35.360
that came to your particular tastes.

25:36.640 --> 25:38.880
It's pretty much just Michael and City of Angels.

25:38.880 --> 25:41.200
But can you imagine if she just found out about it?

25:41.200 --> 25:42.400
Like, wait, what?

25:42.400 --> 25:43.920
Say that again.

25:43.920 --> 25:44.560
Gotta go.

25:44.560 --> 25:46.800
And then there's just like a Deborah-shaped hole in the wall.

25:47.360 --> 25:48.320
If you watch the end of that movie, you're like-

25:48.320 --> 25:49.280
Diamond, please.

25:49.280 --> 25:50.000
Diamond, yes.

25:50.880 --> 25:52.240
Well, that's confusing.

25:52.240 --> 25:53.040
That's what I need.

25:54.960 --> 25:55.760
I can't imagine.

25:55.760 --> 25:56.960
Can we all agree, though,

25:56.960 --> 25:59.760
that we would read this woman's book so hard?

25:59.760 --> 26:00.880
Oh my God, yes.

26:00.880 --> 26:01.120
Yeah.

26:01.120 --> 26:02.080
The accentuation.

26:02.080 --> 26:02.640
So hard.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.680
If she changes the angels.

26:05.680 --> 26:07.600
We'd read passages out loud,

26:07.600 --> 26:09.120
but don't say that too loud

26:09.120 --> 26:12.080
because Terry Gross will hear and she'll come for your flavor.

26:12.080 --> 26:15.040
Oh, you're reading passages from an angel book.

26:15.040 --> 26:15.920
That sounds great.

26:15.920 --> 26:18.080
Tonight on Fresh Air, angel books.

26:18.080 --> 26:18.880
Let's blow it out.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.040
Let's do this.

26:21.040 --> 26:22.400
This week on Fresh Air,

26:24.080 --> 26:25.840
angels in the sky with diamond

26:25.840 --> 26:26.800
or something like that.

26:28.240 --> 26:30.640
Griffin hasn't thought of the title of the thing yet,

26:30.640 --> 26:32.560
but I've been Terry Gross.

26:32.560 --> 26:35.040
And I just, I don't know what the fuck-

26:35.040 --> 26:37.600
This has been the shortest Fresh Air episode ever.

26:37.600 --> 26:39.760
What if, like, as we're recording this,

26:39.760 --> 26:41.360
she's doing an episode like,

26:41.360 --> 26:43.360
people have been chomping our flavor.

26:43.360 --> 26:44.160
What's up with that?

26:44.800 --> 26:46.160
Let's talk about that right now.

26:46.960 --> 26:48.240
Hold on, let me listen into the bug

26:48.240 --> 26:49.840
that I've got planted in Griffin's room.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.840
Something about Wendy's precogs.

26:53.840 --> 26:54.960
Is there something with that?

26:54.960 --> 26:55.840
Can we do something?

26:55.840 --> 26:57.360
My producer's shaking his head no.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.600
No, but I'm going to go for it anyway.

26:59.600 --> 27:00.880
That's Fresh Air.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.000
That's how we do.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.160
Can we say fuckability on the public?

27:04.160 --> 27:06.160
Nope, we can't say fuckability.

27:06.160 --> 27:08.960
Lenny Kravitz marinara breast milk.

27:09.520 --> 27:10.480
Let's take a break.

27:10.480 --> 27:12.240
This comedy has been too rip-roaring.

27:12.800 --> 27:15.200
Yeah, it's just too funny.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.480
Is this too funny?

27:16.480 --> 27:17.680
If I had one note,

27:17.680 --> 27:19.600
I guess it would be that it's too funny.

27:20.240 --> 27:20.480
Yeah.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.840
Justin, let me ask you a question.

27:24.560 --> 27:25.120
Hit me, bud.

27:25.120 --> 27:27.440
Say I want to become a new dude.

27:27.440 --> 27:29.520
Maybe I've been a fan for a long time

27:30.080 --> 27:35.120
and the past couple of Max Fun drives have passed me by

27:35.120 --> 27:38.480
and I haven't had a job or maybe times have been tight.

27:38.480 --> 27:40.560
Maybe I just feel a little stingy that day,

27:40.560 --> 27:43.200
but this year, this year I'm ready.

27:43.760 --> 27:44.400
Yeah.

27:44.400 --> 27:46.240
But I got one question for you.

27:46.240 --> 27:48.000
What is the one question that you have?

27:48.000 --> 27:49.120
And it better be one.

27:49.120 --> 27:50.880
No, don't do add-ons.

27:50.880 --> 27:51.840
What's in it for me?

27:52.560 --> 27:54.080
What's in it for big daddy?

27:54.720 --> 27:56.080
Well, big daddy.

27:56.080 --> 27:57.200
I can't with that.

27:57.840 --> 27:59.680
Well, big daddy donor.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.320
Good news, big daddy.

28:02.320 --> 28:05.200
We have a ton of great gifts for you

28:05.200 --> 28:10.160
if you want to get into donating to the Maximum Fun Network.

28:10.160 --> 28:12.880

And remember that this money goes to so many great shows

28:16.240 --> 28:19.600

28:19.600 --> 28:21.680
But here are gift-wise, here's what you could get.

At $5 a month, you're going to get exclusive bonus content.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.400

28:28.400 --> 28:31.520

28:31.520 --> 28:34.800

28:37.440 --> 28:38.960
I'm assuming you do, you're here.

28:38.960 --> 28:43.680
You're going to get a live show that we recorded in San Francisco in February.

28:43.680 --> 28:44.560
Awesome.

28:44.560 --> 28:45.920
You're going to get a-

28:45.920 --> 28:47.360
Go ahead and tell people what it is.

28:47.360 --> 28:49.120
Yeah, just come on out and say it.

28:49.120 --> 28:57.840
You're going to get the only extant non-Deep Web episode of Big Gulp

28:58.560 --> 29:01.360
recorded live at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery,

29:01.360 --> 29:05.120
which is apropos, because let's pray to God that it stays buried.

29:05.120 --> 29:09.280
And the one and only episode of Big Gulp, you're going to get that.

29:09.280 --> 29:10.720
You're also going to get the-

29:11.920 --> 29:17.120
Our friend Lin Manuel Miranda did a version-

29:17.120 --> 29:21.120
He wrote the lyrics to Ghost Horse that we sang.

29:21.120 --> 29:23.040
Well, it's actually a parody of a song from Guys and Girls,

29:23.040 --> 29:25.520
but he wrote the song called Ghost Horse,

29:25.520 --> 29:32.320
and he sent us, when he first pitched it to us, a demo MP3 of that song

29:32.320 --> 29:34.160
with him singing all three parts.

29:34.160 --> 29:36.720
So that is actually in there for donors.

29:36.720 --> 29:37.920
He said it was cool if we include it.

29:37.920 --> 29:42.720
So he's got a hot new show called Hamilton that Paul McCartney went to

29:42.720 --> 29:45.280
and Bill Clinton went to, but before that,

29:45.280 --> 29:48.560
he wrote the lyrics to a song called Ghost Horse for us to sing.

29:48.560 --> 29:50.240
So you can hear his original demo.

29:51.440 --> 29:53.520
That's just the My Brother, My Brother, and Me stuff.

29:53.520 --> 29:55.280
That's just the My Brother, My Brother, and Me stuff.

29:55.280 --> 29:56.800
There's a- If you like The Adventure Zone,

29:56.800 --> 30:02.080
there's a prequel episode before the storyline that you can hear.

30:02.080 --> 30:04.400
I'm actually super high on prequel right now.

30:07.680 --> 30:08.800
That's just $5 a month.

30:08.800 --> 30:12.080
If you pledge $5 a month, you're going to get a boatload of stuff.

30:12.080 --> 30:13.120
That's just our stuff.

30:13.120 --> 30:16.880
There's more stuff from Sawbones and Bunker Buddies and so much more.

30:16.880 --> 30:18.960
There's a ton of crap in there for $5 a month.

30:18.960 --> 30:22.320
$10 a month, you're going to get a Drive exclusive tote bag.

30:22.320 --> 30:25.360
How are you going to carry around all your bonus episodes?

30:25.360 --> 30:28.720
Probably on an iPod or some kind of mechanical device, right?

30:30.000 --> 30:31.520
I mean, that's funny.

30:31.520 --> 30:33.040
But it's bits and bytes.

30:33.040 --> 30:34.640
Yeah, it's all bits and bytes.

30:34.640 --> 30:37.760
You can jam those into a bag, carry them around for it.

30:37.760 --> 30:40.400
My tote bag is too full of bits and bytes.

30:40.400 --> 30:41.520
It's hurting my shoulder.

30:42.400 --> 30:45.120
For $20 a month, you're going to get an in-flight power pack.

30:45.120 --> 30:45.760
This is awesome.

30:46.480 --> 30:49.040
A mobile device charger, collapsible water bottle,

30:49.040 --> 30:53.200
antibacterial wipes, and Pilotwings all or most.

30:53.200 --> 30:54.240
Wait, what?

30:54.240 --> 30:54.960
No, hold on.

30:55.520 --> 30:59.760
Do you mean the plastic awesome Pilotwings or the classic...

31:01.360 --> 31:02.800
I don't mean a copy of Pilotwings.

31:02.800 --> 31:05.280
I mean, you're going to get plastic Max Fun branded Pilotwings.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.000
Are you sure?

31:06.000 --> 31:06.720
You can pin on your shirt.

31:06.720 --> 31:08.960
Are we 100% sure?

31:08.960 --> 31:11.040
Because I would love to, as an adult now,

31:11.040 --> 31:15.440
I really think that I could be better at landing that goddamn hang glider.

31:15.440 --> 31:18.080
Yes, I'm positive it's not a copy of the game Pilotwings,

31:18.080 --> 31:19.360
but it's still excellent.

31:20.240 --> 31:24.480
$35 a month, you get a pair of rocket engraved shot glasses.

31:25.520 --> 31:28.560
Do you get all the previous levels?

31:28.560 --> 31:29.600
That is correct, kid.

31:29.600 --> 31:30.320
All stacks.

31:30.960 --> 31:31.760
All stacks.

31:31.760 --> 31:32.080
Wow.

31:32.720 --> 31:33.280
Wow.

31:33.280 --> 31:36.640
Yeah, so at 35, you're getting the rocket engraved shot glasses,

31:36.640 --> 31:39.200
the in-flight power pack, the drive exclusive tote bag,

31:39.200 --> 31:40.960
and the exclusive bonus content.

31:40.960 --> 31:42.880
Like, that's an amazing deal.

31:42.880 --> 31:43.920
And just think about it.

31:43.920 --> 31:48.480
Like, for $5 and $10, that's like one or two beers out of the bar a month.

31:48.480 --> 31:51.760
Just like skip one or two beers, and that's going to cover it.

31:51.760 --> 31:55.280
$20, that's like one meal out a month.

31:55.280 --> 31:55.840
You know what I mean?

31:55.840 --> 31:58.880
Like, $35, that's one meal out with someone else a month.

31:58.880 --> 31:59.520
Like, the-

31:59.520 --> 32:06.000
$18,000, that is one novelty fish tank,

32:06.000 --> 32:08.480
large enough to store a small shark.

32:08.480 --> 32:08.880
Exactly.

32:08.880 --> 32:09.840
By a month.

32:09.840 --> 32:13.600
One of those a month, you are hardly even going to miss that money.

32:13.600 --> 32:15.120
$18,000, $18,000.

32:15.120 --> 32:15.920
We don't charge.

32:15.920 --> 32:17.760
We don't charge for the show.

32:17.760 --> 32:18.480
We keep it free.

32:19.040 --> 32:21.920
But if you feel like you've gotten something out of it,

32:21.920 --> 32:23.840
and you'd like to support us and make more,

32:24.560 --> 32:26.000
gosh, that would just mean the world to us.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.280
If you would go to maximumfund.org forward slash donate,

32:30.480 --> 32:31.440
you'll feel good.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.520
You'll feel good when you listen.

32:33.520 --> 32:36.080
You'll think, hey, I'm helping make this happen.

32:36.080 --> 32:38.080
And if it's something that you want to do,

32:38.080 --> 32:40.480
and it feels like the time to do it, do it right now.

32:40.480 --> 32:41.840
Do it while you listen to the episode.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.760
If you're driving, pull over to the side of the road.

32:43.760 --> 32:45.280
Well, don't tell people to do that.

32:45.840 --> 32:47.280
If you're driving, wait until you-

32:47.280 --> 32:50.160
I'll give you permission to wait until you get where you're going before you-

32:50.160 --> 32:53.040
But don't wait too long, because this kind of stuff will fly out of your head.

32:53.040 --> 32:55.760
Take care of it as soon as you're ready to do it.

32:55.760 --> 32:57.680
And people are going to be like, I'm in really-

32:57.680 --> 33:01.120
you're going to start to hear people talking about specifically Big Gulp,

33:02.240 --> 33:03.840
and you do not want to miss out on that.

33:03.840 --> 33:09.040
So go to maximumfund.org forward slash donate and get a ton of great stuff.

33:09.040 --> 33:11.200
And if you do, tweet at us so we can thank you.

33:11.200 --> 33:11.680
Yeah.

33:11.680 --> 33:12.960
How about a question, Justin?

33:12.960 --> 33:15.840
Yes, a question is something I'd love to provide you with, Griffin.

33:17.360 --> 33:21.520
I get asked to take people's picture a lot, but I always feel awkward doing so.

33:22.080 --> 33:25.280
I don't do selfies or deal with phone cameras or any cameras at all.

33:26.720 --> 33:28.880
I get worried that their picture will suck,

33:28.880 --> 33:30.400
and they might ask me to take another one.

33:31.680 --> 33:33.600
Or just look at the picture silently.

33:34.400 --> 33:34.900
Huh.

33:35.520 --> 33:36.020
Interesting.

33:37.040 --> 33:38.880
See what you did here, the framing.

33:38.880 --> 33:42.800
I see what an unconventional take on capturing the human form.

33:43.680 --> 33:46.640
When I say I'm bad at taking pictures, no one believes me.

33:46.640 --> 33:49.920
I try to avoid these awkward moments, but it seems to be unavoidable.

33:49.920 --> 33:53.920
I tried to toss responsibility to someone else around me, but it rarely works.

33:53.920 --> 33:56.800
What do I do to avoid these awkward situations?

33:56.800 --> 33:59.200
You should stop hanging around the Statue of Liberty.

34:01.280 --> 34:03.120
Just like with your hands in your pocket, like,

34:03.120 --> 34:06.800
well, I wonder if anybody needs a little assistance.

34:06.800 --> 34:07.840
I'm happy to help.

34:07.840 --> 34:11.120
How often does this kind of thing come up?

34:11.840 --> 34:13.200
Okay, so can I say something?

34:13.200 --> 34:13.600
Yeah.

34:13.600 --> 34:18.400
And you're gonna think I'm lying, but Rachel can attest to this.

34:18.400 --> 34:23.600
Anytime we are out at a place that is even a little bit touristy,

34:23.600 --> 34:25.360
I always get asked to take people's pictures.

34:25.360 --> 34:30.480
Now, not a problem for me, because I'm fucking tight at it, basically.

34:31.200 --> 34:32.640
But then this would be my question, Griffin.

34:32.640 --> 34:35.600
Should this person try to avoid these situations

34:35.600 --> 34:38.480
or just get better at taking pictures?

34:38.480 --> 34:42.320
It's literally a one-step process of getting better at taking pictures,

34:42.320 --> 34:44.160
because cameras do fucking everything now.

34:44.160 --> 34:46.880
They automatically do everything that you need them to do.

34:46.880 --> 34:52.160
You just have to put the human beings that you are capturing in the box

34:52.160 --> 34:55.360
so that they occupy two-thirds of the space of the box.

34:56.720 --> 34:58.800
And now you're a master photographer.

35:00.240 --> 35:03.920
Take the human beings, point the box at them,

35:03.920 --> 35:07.600
get them in that box so that they occupy two-thirds of the box.

35:08.800 --> 35:11.280
Sixty-six point six repeating percent of the space.

35:11.280 --> 35:15.360
Now, I know you're wondering, which two-thirds of them should I do?

35:15.360 --> 35:18.720
The part with the face on it, and then you want to get the head...

35:19.360 --> 35:22.880
You want the extra third to be above them.

35:22.880 --> 35:25.680
But what if they have good features they want to get?

35:25.680 --> 35:27.200
What if they have a really juicy butt?

35:27.760 --> 35:29.360
Well, then you gotta do a caricature.

35:29.360 --> 35:35.040
Can you take a picture of me?

35:35.040 --> 35:38.480
No, but what I can do is draw you a whimsical drawing

35:38.480 --> 35:39.920
showing your giant bottom.

35:41.520 --> 35:43.680
Do you want to be on a surfboard, maybe graduating?

35:44.960 --> 35:47.200
I went to New Orleans with a group of my friends,

35:47.200 --> 35:50.960
and we had somebody take a picture of all of us at a bar,

35:50.960 --> 35:52.480
and they took a picture of my camera,

35:52.480 --> 35:55.120
and handed me the camera pretty tight, right?

35:55.120 --> 35:57.520
And literally, we were the bottom half,

35:57.520 --> 35:59.600
and then the sky was the top half.

35:59.600 --> 36:00.960
Hey, fucking...

36:00.960 --> 36:02.320
Mark from Ork!

36:02.320 --> 36:03.760
I don't have antennae!

36:08.160 --> 36:09.680
You're not looking at the sky saying,

36:09.680 --> 36:10.960
man, I wish we had this at home.

36:12.240 --> 36:13.600
You know that part.

36:13.600 --> 36:14.720
You know what that looks like.

36:14.720 --> 36:17.040
Here's what you do to diffuse it next time somebody asks you

36:17.040 --> 36:18.160
to take their picture, say,

36:18.160 --> 36:21.040
I can't do that for you, but I would love to paint you.

36:23.200 --> 36:24.720
I have a studio nearby.

36:24.720 --> 36:26.080
Okay, Joseph, let me pitch this.

36:26.080 --> 36:28.640
Ask me to take your picture.

36:28.640 --> 36:30.080
Should I ask you to take my picture?

36:30.080 --> 36:32.400
No, and then just walk away.

36:33.360 --> 36:35.440
And then just escape into the world,

36:35.440 --> 36:38.480
or just say, I wish I could, but I'm unstuck in time,

36:38.480 --> 36:39.360
and then walk away.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.200
Sorry, hologram.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.440
I guess that'll work for a lot of shit, huh?

36:43.440 --> 36:44.720
Sorry, guardian angel.

36:48.320 --> 36:49.200
You could see me?

36:51.600 --> 36:54.240
I bet the two thirds thing is the part that's messing him up.

36:54.240 --> 36:56.640
He just keeps getting closer and closer

36:56.640 --> 36:59.120
till he's basically pressing the lens against their face.

36:59.120 --> 37:00.080
Like, is this right?

37:00.720 --> 37:02.880
Am I, am I photographing?

37:02.880 --> 37:04.000
Is this photo?

37:04.000 --> 37:06.320
You could also say, I'm afraid that you might be a ghost,

37:06.320 --> 37:07.840
and I would kill you if I took your picture.

37:07.840 --> 37:09.920
Ooh, that's how it works?

37:09.920 --> 37:10.960
That is how it happens.

37:11.920 --> 37:12.960
Oh, just say something like,

37:12.960 --> 37:15.200
oh, I've fallen for this before, and walk away.

37:15.760 --> 37:18.400
It's just him going like, oh, he's probably got a good reason.

37:18.400 --> 37:21.040
There are so many dumb things you could do,

37:21.040 --> 37:22.240
as we've established,

37:22.240 --> 37:25.280
or you could make it so their human frames

37:26.000 --> 37:29.920
occupy 66% of the box on the camera,

37:29.920 --> 37:33.440
and then press the button that activates the camera.

37:33.440 --> 37:35.120
It's the easiest.

37:35.120 --> 37:37.200
It's so, it's the easiest thing.

37:37.200 --> 37:38.080
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

37:38.640 --> 37:39.280
Please.

37:39.280 --> 37:41.200
This Yahoo was actually sent in by a ton of people

37:41.840 --> 37:43.360
over the course of the past couple weeks,

37:43.360 --> 37:45.520
and I thought that we should talk about it now.

37:45.520 --> 37:46.640
Thank you to everybody who sent it in.

37:46.640 --> 37:49.040
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Max, who asks,

37:49.040 --> 37:52.160
can you describe your face expression

37:52.160 --> 37:53.520
while eating and drinking?

37:54.320 --> 37:56.240
I am doing a research now.

37:56.240 --> 37:57.280
Oh, is that it?

37:57.280 --> 37:57.760
That was it?

37:57.760 --> 37:58.400
One more time, please.

37:58.400 --> 37:59.520
One more time, from the top.

37:59.520 --> 38:01.520
Can you describe your face expression

38:01.520 --> 38:02.800
while eating and drinking?

38:03.680 --> 38:05.120
I am doing a research now?

38:05.680 --> 38:06.560
And there's a question mark.

38:06.560 --> 38:09.280
I don't know if they're maybe kibitzing

38:09.280 --> 38:10.720
on when they'll do the research,

38:11.680 --> 38:13.440
if this could be considered research,

38:13.440 --> 38:15.520
if they're the people doing the research.

38:15.520 --> 38:17.840
Or if they're participating in the research.

38:17.840 --> 38:19.200
There's a lot of variables.

38:19.200 --> 38:21.760
Think about it, though, because when you eat,

38:21.760 --> 38:24.560
everybody, think about your face when you eat,

38:24.560 --> 38:25.520
because I think about it,

38:25.520 --> 38:28.160
and I think that I make like a yummy face,

38:28.160 --> 38:32.160
and I, it's a smile, because I'm happy to be eating.

38:32.160 --> 38:34.320
But I don't know for sure, because I never-

38:34.320 --> 38:37.760
I know that mine, because I've practiced

38:37.760 --> 38:40.000
in front of a mirror and been told a couple of times,

38:40.000 --> 38:43.600
brow furrowed, very focused, almost angry,

38:43.600 --> 38:48.160
defensive, very focused, like in the middle distance,

38:48.160 --> 38:51.120
stare, just trying to get it over with

38:51.120 --> 38:52.320
as quickly as possible.

38:52.960 --> 38:54.480
Do you hate eating food, Travis?

38:54.480 --> 38:57.120
No, I love it so much that I'm afraid I'll be interrupted.

38:57.840 --> 38:59.840
That's my biggest concern, is that someone

38:59.840 --> 39:02.240
may try to talk to me or engage me

39:02.240 --> 39:05.120
in some kind of interaction while I'm putting

39:05.120 --> 39:07.040
the best stuff in my mouth.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.480
If I'm eating a really good burger,

39:10.480 --> 39:12.400
I wish everyone else was dead too.

39:12.400 --> 39:14.560
I wish everyone else was dead for that minute.

39:14.560 --> 39:18.240
A minute, that minute, Travis.

39:18.240 --> 39:20.720
For that minute, I'm not asking for the world.

39:20.720 --> 39:22.320
You are asking for the whole-

39:22.320 --> 39:24.560
Consume my burger quickly, you just leave me alone

39:24.560 --> 39:25.840
for the brief amount of time.

39:25.840 --> 39:26.800
Don't sit there and say like,

39:26.800 --> 39:28.640
oh, you look like someone's about to take your food away.

39:28.640 --> 39:30.880
Yes, yes, I'm afraid of that.

39:30.880 --> 39:32.240
Please just let me enjoy this.

39:32.240 --> 39:34.400
Has anyone ever, has anyone,

39:34.400 --> 39:37.680
I'm gonna fucking diagnose you right now, Travis.

39:37.680 --> 39:41.440
Because I feel like your relationship with food

39:41.440 --> 39:44.000
has been a running goof on this show.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.600
And I wanna get to the bottom of it.

39:45.600 --> 39:48.560
Has anybody actually ever, while you were sucking down

39:48.560 --> 39:51.760
some baby back ribs, ever walked up to you,

39:51.760 --> 39:55.440
obtained the ribs, and removed them from your grasp?

39:55.440 --> 39:57.120
No, I tell you, the real thing, Griffin,

39:57.120 --> 40:00.480
the real truth is that I am very verbose.

40:00.480 --> 40:02.640
I like to talk a lot, especially when I'm having

40:02.640 --> 40:03.920
a meal with friends.

40:03.920 --> 40:06.640
And what I end up doing is talking so much

40:06.640 --> 40:09.280
that I fail to actually consume my food.

40:09.280 --> 40:10.640
So I've gotten really good-

40:10.640 --> 40:12.080
That's patently untrue.

40:12.080 --> 40:14.960
I've never seen, I've eaten hundreds of meals with you

40:14.960 --> 40:16.000
and I've never seen that happen.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.200
Well, not with you guys.

40:17.920 --> 40:18.800
Oh, okay.

40:18.800 --> 40:20.480
I'm saying with like people I like

40:20.480 --> 40:21.680
and don't talk to all the time.

40:22.240 --> 40:23.200
Sure, right.

40:23.200 --> 40:26.160
I'm saying you, as soon as food is presented to you,

40:26.160 --> 40:29.040
you unhinge your jaw and place your head over the plate

40:29.040 --> 40:30.960
like some sort of fucking moray eel.

40:31.920 --> 40:34.000
But like, when you put gas in your car,

40:34.000 --> 40:36.160
you're never thinking like, I wish I could savor this more.

40:36.160 --> 40:38.000
You're trying to get the gas in your car quickly

40:38.000 --> 40:39.280
so you can go on about your day.

40:39.280 --> 40:41.360
I thought you loved eating so much.

40:41.360 --> 40:44.640
I do, I want it to go quickly and beautifully

40:44.640 --> 40:46.080
and wonderfully and done.

40:46.640 --> 40:50.800
You're like an Olympic ice skater, right?

40:50.800 --> 40:51.120
Yes.

40:51.120 --> 40:51.760
You want it to be perfect.

40:51.760 --> 40:53.360
In so many ways.

40:53.360 --> 40:54.960
You're like, you want it to be perfect,

40:54.960 --> 40:56.400
but you also need it to like,

40:56.400 --> 40:58.480
you don't want to draw it out any longer than you have to

40:58.480 --> 40:59.840
because your legs are going to give out.

40:59.840 --> 41:01.680
Exactly, you've nailed it.

41:02.800 --> 41:04.960
It's like the most beautiful symphony would really like

41:04.960 --> 41:07.680
lose its luster on like the 16th hour, wouldn't it?

41:07.680 --> 41:09.760
But I think everybody has though,

41:09.760 --> 41:12.640
like gotten their food taken away at a restaurant

41:12.640 --> 41:13.440
when you weren't done.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.640
Maybe you go to the B room and you come back and you're like,

41:16.640 --> 41:22.080
oh, and there's nothing in that moment more delicious on earth

41:22.080 --> 41:27.120
than those like seven chips and half a pickle

41:27.120 --> 41:31.520
and like one bite of the calzone.

41:31.520 --> 41:34.240
Have you ever had the moment where they come for your food

41:34.240 --> 41:36.240
and then you're like, oh wait, I'm not done.

41:36.240 --> 41:38.400
And you speak before you think and realize

41:38.400 --> 41:41.200
that the only thing on the plate are like three chips

41:41.200 --> 41:42.640
and a half a pickle.

41:42.640 --> 41:44.800
And they're like trying to take you like, I don't know what.

41:44.800 --> 41:47.680
And then they kind of look at you and you're like, no, it's fine.

41:48.800 --> 41:51.280
What's worse that or just like, hold on one second.

41:53.680 --> 41:55.600
Yeah, we're done now.

41:55.600 --> 41:56.800
What if they could put that,

41:56.800 --> 42:00.560
they could fucking time lock that and put it on the menu.

42:00.560 --> 42:05.280
Like for $35, we will give you the last seven chips

42:05.280 --> 42:07.840
and a pickle that we took from somebody

42:07.840 --> 42:09.120
that they didn't get to eat.

42:09.120 --> 42:10.640
And it will be so much more delicious.

42:13.280 --> 42:17.680
But you secretly order it from someone else at the table.

42:17.680 --> 42:20.160
So they like look away for a second

42:20.160 --> 42:23.200
and then they look back at you and you're eating six chips

42:23.200 --> 42:24.320
and there's nothing in front of them.

42:24.320 --> 42:25.760
And they're like, oh, Jeremy, no.

42:26.800 --> 42:28.880
Jeremy, tell me you didn't do this to me.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.240
You did this to me again.

42:30.880 --> 42:32.640
Why do we keep coming here?

42:32.640 --> 42:35.360
That's my ketchup mess I made on the plate.

42:37.200 --> 42:37.920
Jeremy, no.

42:38.720 --> 42:40.720
Can we, I'm into this idea now.

42:40.720 --> 42:43.360
I'm getting super deep into this idea of like,

42:44.000 --> 42:50.320
going to fucking the most notoriously slow TGI Fridays in town.

42:50.320 --> 42:52.480
They take a while to get your food out to you.

42:52.480 --> 42:55.680
Going there, ordering a big plate of baby back ribs,

42:55.680 --> 42:58.640
some fries and a dish, a side dish.

42:58.640 --> 42:59.680
I don't know what they have there.

43:00.640 --> 43:01.520
Never been.

43:01.520 --> 43:05.600
And waiting for 40 minutes for my food to get there

43:05.600 --> 43:08.080
and then they bring it to the table, put it down.

43:08.720 --> 43:11.920
I stand up, put $40 on the table,

43:11.920 --> 43:15.520
walk out and leave and drive home and I guess jerk off

43:15.520 --> 43:18.480
because it would be the most incredible tantric experience

43:18.480 --> 43:19.440
of my entire life.

43:21.360 --> 43:23.920
You're laughing, Travis, because you could never do that.

43:25.200 --> 43:29.920
I will give you $10,000 if you can ever go to TGI Fridays,

43:29.920 --> 43:33.200
order a plate of delicious, sweaty baby back ribs

43:33.200 --> 43:35.120
and then stand up as soon as they get there and walk out.

43:35.120 --> 43:38.480
Griffin, you are so correct because sometimes

43:38.480 --> 43:42.160
just the very thought of maybe I might go out to eat later

43:42.160 --> 43:45.520
makes me so happy in a way that most normal people

43:45.520 --> 43:46.720
will never experience.

43:47.280 --> 43:50.080
The idea of having someone bring food to me

43:50.080 --> 43:53.520
that I did nothing to earn is very exciting.

43:53.520 --> 43:56.000
Is it kind of wonderful being like a food goblin?

43:56.000 --> 43:56.880
It is.

43:56.880 --> 43:58.080
It's so freeing.

43:58.080 --> 44:00.080
If you can let go of all the mores

44:00.080 --> 44:01.920
and everything holding you back about what you think

44:01.920 --> 44:03.520
is appropriate about how to eat,

44:03.520 --> 44:05.360
your life becomes so much better.

44:05.360 --> 44:06.800
I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy,

44:06.800 --> 44:08.400
but I guess there is some satisfaction

44:08.400 --> 44:09.360
to be derived from it.

44:09.360 --> 44:11.680
I just feel like you're a prisoner of your own creation.

44:11.680 --> 44:12.800
No, I'm free.

44:12.800 --> 44:14.720
You're the one trapped in a food prison.

44:14.720 --> 44:15.840
Look in your own life.

44:15.840 --> 44:18.320
Don't just sit there and judge my way of life.

44:18.320 --> 44:21.120
Walk a mile in my food filled shoes.

44:21.120 --> 44:22.880
Why is there food in there?

44:22.880 --> 44:25.360
I eat so quickly it falls down.

44:25.360 --> 44:27.120
Sometimes I eat so quickly it falls down into my shoes.

44:27.120 --> 44:29.760
Why are there Twizzlers in your Pumas, heavyweights?

44:31.360 --> 44:33.680
If someone told you you had to make shoes out of food,

44:33.680 --> 44:34.960
what food would it be, girl?

44:34.960 --> 44:35.840
God damn it.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.360
I would say probably ciabatta.

44:37.360 --> 44:39.280
A firm bread or a jerky.

44:39.280 --> 44:42.160
Some kind of firm bread with jerky laces.

44:42.800 --> 44:44.560
I get one of those big bolognese

44:44.560 --> 44:45.680
that they haven't cut up yet.

44:46.640 --> 44:49.360
I see in meat stores, but you never buy them

44:49.360 --> 44:50.480
because like what am I going to do with that?

44:50.480 --> 44:52.560
But Justin, what about the coyotes?

44:52.560 --> 44:54.320
I'm a bartender slash server

44:54.320 --> 44:56.080
and I work with a lot of awesome people.

44:56.080 --> 44:58.400
If I happen to bring friends or family

44:58.400 --> 45:00.000
and eat my bar when I'm not working,

45:00.000 --> 45:01.760
I of course want to generously tip my friends

45:01.760 --> 45:03.600
slash coworker that waited on us,

45:03.600 --> 45:05.360
but it always feels awkward.

45:05.360 --> 45:07.600
Similarly, if I have a drink after my shift

45:07.600 --> 45:09.280
and want to tip the bartender,

45:09.280 --> 45:12.160
he or she is uncomfortable about me tipping them as well.

45:12.160 --> 45:13.760
I've even fallen in the trap of being weird

45:13.760 --> 45:14.960
about my friends tipping me.

45:15.520 --> 45:17.280
How do I navigate this situation?

45:17.280 --> 45:19.120
Do I only tip them a customary 20%?

45:20.480 --> 45:22.720
Am I required to tip them more because we're friends?

45:23.920 --> 45:25.760
What do I say when they say,

45:25.760 --> 45:27.040
oh, you don't have to tip me.

45:27.840 --> 45:30.720
Help, that's from tiptoeing in Ann Arbor.

45:30.720 --> 45:35.600
God, if only the Japanese style.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.600
This is probably why Japan was like,

45:40.320 --> 45:41.040
let's flip it.

45:42.400 --> 45:43.760
Why don't we flip that switch?

45:43.760 --> 45:46.560
Because we work together and this is crazy.

45:47.120 --> 45:48.320
Flip the switch, guys.

45:48.320 --> 45:49.040
No more tips.

45:50.080 --> 45:52.880
This is one of the rare times when I'm forced to,

45:52.880 --> 45:54.160
I have no idea.

45:54.160 --> 45:56.400
Yeah, I don't even know where to start.

45:56.400 --> 45:58.160
Wait, you're saying that literally everything

45:58.160 --> 46:00.640
we've ever advised people on-

46:00.640 --> 46:01.600
You had some ideas.

46:01.600 --> 46:02.960
You had a lot of ideas.

46:02.960 --> 46:04.880
I at least, in those scenarios,

46:04.880 --> 46:07.440
had some kind of gut reaction that I followed

46:07.440 --> 46:09.600
and I was like, yeah, this is what I would do.

46:09.600 --> 46:13.360
I listened to you read the question

46:13.360 --> 46:14.400
and in my brain was going,

46:15.440 --> 46:18.080
because just the idea of handing someone,

46:18.080 --> 46:21.040
because my immediate reaction is just this idea of,

46:21.040 --> 46:23.040
well, you know what goes into it.

46:23.040 --> 46:25.200
You know what the process is.

46:25.200 --> 46:27.120
You know what deserves a tip, what doesn't.

46:27.120 --> 46:29.280
You know what they're actually doing

46:29.280 --> 46:30.480
that would earn them money.

46:31.040 --> 46:33.200
And so you should be the best judge of it.

46:33.200 --> 46:36.000
So then if you're left going, I still don't know.

46:36.720 --> 46:37.920
Well, then where, I don't know.

46:38.720 --> 46:40.960
Yes, if they say not to tip them, don't tip them.

46:41.920 --> 46:42.800
Yes.

46:42.800 --> 46:47.120
What if when you start a job at a new restaurant,

46:47.840 --> 46:50.880
you have to give every other person

46:50.880 --> 46:53.200
working in that restaurant $10.

46:53.200 --> 46:55.680
It'll be a pretty big lump sum right up front.

46:55.680 --> 46:57.440
And then when you wait on each other,

46:57.440 --> 46:59.440
you just hand that $10 back and forth.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.720
And it's like a friendship 10 spot.

47:02.720 --> 47:04.400
And you just pass that back and forth.

47:04.400 --> 47:06.080
And then when you quit the job,

47:06.720 --> 47:09.280
because you tooted in the kitchen,

47:09.280 --> 47:10.400
I've never worked in a restaurant in my life.

47:10.400 --> 47:11.920
You can never return.

47:11.920 --> 47:15.840
I don't know how anything works in my office.

47:16.960 --> 47:20.000
Then you cash out.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.040
No, that doesn't make sense.

47:21.760 --> 47:23.120
I was close to something though, wasn't I?

47:23.120 --> 47:23.920
I was really close to something.

47:23.920 --> 47:25.360
You were teetering on the edge.

47:25.360 --> 47:28.480
When I was a young man back in high school,

47:28.480 --> 47:30.880
I worked at the Blockbuster Video, rest in peace.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.880
I thought that what everybody should do,

47:34.880 --> 47:37.200
I thought people would come in

47:37.200 --> 47:39.520
and I would get rid of their late fees or something.

47:39.520 --> 47:41.520
And I thought, what we should do

47:41.520 --> 47:43.360
is just have a system of hookups.

47:43.360 --> 47:46.960
It's like, you come to Blockbuster and I'll hook you up.

47:46.960 --> 47:48.800
And then when I come to TGI Fridays,

47:48.800 --> 47:50.960
you hook me up, maybe some free mod sticks

47:50.960 --> 47:52.480
or I don't have to tip you.

47:52.480 --> 47:55.120
And I thought that I basically invented bartering

47:55.120 --> 47:57.360
is what I had done, but I hadn't really realized that.

47:57.360 --> 47:59.200
I thought this was a great system.

47:59.200 --> 48:02.800
And somehow my stupid teenager brain,

48:02.800 --> 48:04.720
the system had been put into place.

48:05.280 --> 48:09.920
So I just started giving everybody who I knew the hookup

48:09.920 --> 48:12.320
and just kind of assuming it would karmically come back

48:12.320 --> 48:13.760
to me, pay it forward.

48:13.760 --> 48:17.280
That kind of thing would be revisited

48:17.280 --> 48:19.120
the next time I went to their place of business

48:19.120 --> 48:20.960
and never ever happened.

48:20.960 --> 48:21.920
And I got fired.

48:21.920 --> 48:23.840
Isn't that such an awkward moment

48:23.840 --> 48:25.360
when either someone comes to visit you

48:25.360 --> 48:27.600
at your place of work or you go to visit someone

48:27.600 --> 48:30.880
and it's unclear as if there's an expected,

48:30.880 --> 48:32.960
like if someone's like, oh yeah, come eat at my restaurant.

48:32.960 --> 48:34.560
And then you get there and you're like, wait, is this?

48:35.200 --> 48:36.640
Are they gonna hook, is this a deal?

48:36.640 --> 48:37.600
Are they inviting me here?

48:37.600 --> 48:39.760
And then I'm gonna get a discount, should I ask?

48:39.760 --> 48:42.240
I just wanna point out karmically speaking,

48:42.960 --> 48:45.200
God killed the Blockbuster Video.

48:45.200 --> 48:47.760
Wasn't God that killed the Blockbuster Video,

48:47.760 --> 48:50.480
it was man killed the Blockbuster Video.

48:50.480 --> 48:52.320
No, man couldn't kill Blockbuster Video.

48:52.320 --> 48:54.160
Their fucking business was perfect.

48:54.880 --> 48:57.360
God looked at that and saw pride and said,

48:57.360 --> 48:59.200
you hurt my baby boy, Justin,

48:59.760 --> 49:02.160
and just sort of destroyed the whole thing.

49:02.160 --> 49:04.720
Oh, I thought you were saying God saw the pride in Justin

49:04.720 --> 49:06.880
trying to rework the structure of humanity.

49:06.880 --> 49:12.160
No, he saw Justin fucking giving freely to his fellow man

49:12.160 --> 49:14.560
and Blockbuster Video saying, no, this will not do.

49:14.560 --> 49:15.760
You are fired.

49:15.760 --> 49:20.000
Or Uncle Sam heard that I had figured out the solution

49:20.000 --> 49:22.560
to like ending capitalism.

49:22.560 --> 49:24.720
And they're like, no, this is terrible.

49:24.720 --> 49:26.880
Everybody close down Blockbuster and fit Netflix.

49:28.160 --> 49:29.520
It's time to release Netflix.

49:29.520 --> 49:32.080
But sir, we agreed that would be 2021.

49:32.080 --> 49:35.040
Nah, this kid in West Virginia has cracked the code.

49:35.040 --> 49:38.240
And they were tripped out because then I went to Best Buy

49:38.240 --> 49:40.640
and I started selling people Netflix subscriptions.

49:40.640 --> 49:42.480
Like, wait a minute, he's onto us again.

49:42.480 --> 49:45.520
Justin, you should really go to Burning Man sometime.

49:45.520 --> 49:47.360
I think you'd really get a kick out of it.

49:47.360 --> 49:48.640
Yeah, you think?

49:48.640 --> 49:49.280
What do you make?

49:49.280 --> 49:51.840
Do you make something that you can barter with at Burning Man?

49:51.840 --> 49:52.880
Kelty Grammers?

49:52.880 --> 49:53.520
Yeah.

49:53.520 --> 49:55.280
Well, those probably wouldn't hold up so much

49:55.280 --> 49:57.360
in the 115 degree sun.

49:57.920 --> 49:58.640
Dick jokes?

49:59.600 --> 50:02.240
I don't think those are gonna satisfy.

50:02.240 --> 50:04.960
I wish I could go to Burning Man, but just bring money

50:04.960 --> 50:07.520
and just be the only person there that's allowed to use it.

50:07.520 --> 50:08.960
Because I think that would be,

50:08.960 --> 50:11.280
I think secretly people would really get a kick out of it

50:11.280 --> 50:13.360
because they can like leave Burning Man

50:13.360 --> 50:14.960
and be able to spend it on shit.

50:16.960 --> 50:18.880
And also like, I wouldn't have to worry

50:18.880 --> 50:22.160
about how bad my fish hook earrings are.

50:22.160 --> 50:27.680
Oh God, I just did the potluck thing, didn't I?

50:27.680 --> 50:30.800
I just did the $15 potluck thing.

50:30.800 --> 50:32.640
And I swear I would never become that type of man.

50:32.640 --> 50:35.040
Just like that, Griffin ruined Burning Man.

50:35.040 --> 50:38.480
One episode to kill Burning Man, to unseat Burning Man.

50:38.480 --> 50:40.480
Like 45 seconds of one episode.

50:40.480 --> 50:42.320
Five seconds of one episode to unseat Burning Man.

50:42.320 --> 50:42.800
Well, you know what?

50:42.800 --> 50:45.280
If it's that easy to kill, then it didn't deserve to live.

50:45.280 --> 50:47.600
What if Burning Man like went on long enough

50:47.600 --> 50:49.360
that at first I was like, well,

50:50.960 --> 50:52.960
I could just trade you these three hacky sacks

50:53.600 --> 50:55.600
for like one of those Afghans.

50:55.600 --> 50:58.080
And you're like, that's, I don't know why I need the Afghan

50:58.080 --> 50:59.680
at Burning Man, but okay, let's go for it.

50:59.680 --> 51:01.200
It gets cold in the desert at night.

51:02.160 --> 51:04.560
And then, and then like, it went on.

51:04.560 --> 51:05.280
You're like, you know what?

51:05.280 --> 51:08.880
These hacky sacks are really easy to carry around.

51:08.880 --> 51:11.840
Um, maybe I should just say like, we could use these

51:11.840 --> 51:14.400
to represent like, if I have five hacky sacks,

51:14.960 --> 51:17.520
then that means that like, it's worth one blanket.

51:17.520 --> 51:20.640
It's easier just to keep track of how many things

51:20.640 --> 51:22.080
that we've made or sold.

51:22.080 --> 51:25.280
And then, oh fuck, 48 hours later,

51:25.280 --> 51:26.560
the whole thing has collapsed.

51:26.560 --> 51:27.920
There's a McDonald's there.

51:28.480 --> 51:30.000
They've got the whole, there's, there's-

51:30.000 --> 51:31.760
I'd like a sausage biscuit.

51:31.760 --> 51:34.000
Okay, that's gotta be two and a half hacky sacks.

51:34.800 --> 51:37.040
I gotta cut another hacky sack open.

51:37.040 --> 51:39.680
What are you people even doing with these half hacky sacks?

51:41.120 --> 51:43.600
Minimum hacky sack wage isn't even enough

51:43.600 --> 51:45.760
to buy our own McDonald's hacky sack food.

51:45.760 --> 51:47.200
This is, this is bullshit.

51:48.000 --> 51:49.440
Can I go to Burning Man?

51:49.440 --> 51:50.560
As long as we're talking about Burning Man

51:50.560 --> 51:53.680
for some goddamn reason, can I go to Burning Man

51:53.680 --> 51:57.600
with like, a fucking Yu-Gi-Oh sticker,

51:57.600 --> 52:01.040
one Yu-Gi-Oh sticker, and challenge myself

52:01.040 --> 52:04.400
to trade up to a goddamn Toyota Tundra?

52:04.400 --> 52:06.320
Drive somebody else's Toyota Tundra

52:06.320 --> 52:07.840
away from Burning Man

52:07.840 --> 52:09.760
through a system of Yankee swaps.

52:09.760 --> 52:12.240
That should be like in the least amount of moves,

52:12.240 --> 52:13.920
like kind of like game show.

52:13.920 --> 52:14.720
I would watch that.

52:14.720 --> 52:17.040
It's like, I can get from Yu-Gi-Oh sticker

52:17.040 --> 52:19.520
to Toyota Tundra in five moves.

52:19.520 --> 52:21.120
Guys, I got big news for you.

52:21.120 --> 52:21.600
What's that?

52:21.600 --> 52:32.140
Farm wisdom, farm wisdom, grow some peas with Warren G, farm wisdom.

52:32.140 --> 52:33.140
With what?

52:33.140 --> 52:34.140
With Warren G?

52:34.140 --> 52:36.020
Grow some peas with Warren G, farm wisdom.

52:36.020 --> 52:38.020
That's what I thought, you said okay.

52:38.020 --> 52:41.660
Have you been to Warren G's farm?

52:41.660 --> 52:43.020
The G Ranch?

52:43.020 --> 52:44.860
The G Ranch?

52:44.860 --> 52:46.460
The Circle G?

52:46.460 --> 52:51.260
His potato harvest came in really well this year because I think he's really been...

52:51.260 --> 52:58.620
Regulating the fertilizer, fuck me.

52:58.620 --> 53:00.140
Farm wisdom, here it goes.

53:00.140 --> 53:06.460
If you add a new chicken to a brood of chickens, they'll turn on it as an outsider and peck

53:06.460 --> 53:09.020
it to injury or death.

53:09.020 --> 53:15.180
To avoid this, simply wait until all the chickens are asleep and put the new chicken in the

53:15.180 --> 53:17.380
coop alongside them.

53:17.380 --> 53:21.220
When they wake up, they'll assume that everyone around them are their friends and get on fine

53:21.220 --> 53:22.220
line.

53:22.220 --> 53:23.380
Even the new chicken is fooled by this.

53:23.380 --> 53:26.140
I was with this until that last part.

53:26.140 --> 53:30.780
The new chicken's like, yeah this seems right, nothing weird about this.

53:30.780 --> 53:35.540
There's like 18 of me here and I don't know what that means, but are we cool?

53:35.540 --> 53:36.540
We're cool.

53:36.540 --> 53:41.300
Hey Steve, Fred, Ginger, you, Andy, how long have you been here?

53:41.300 --> 53:43.060
I don't know, I feel like forever?

53:43.060 --> 53:44.060
Yeah that seems right.

53:44.060 --> 53:45.060
Let's be friends.

53:45.060 --> 53:47.380
I also feel like I've been here forever.

53:47.380 --> 53:48.380
That's weird.

53:48.380 --> 53:49.380
Yeah?

53:49.380 --> 53:50.380
That sounds about good.

53:50.380 --> 53:51.860
You guys aren't going to like peck me to death, are you?

53:51.860 --> 53:54.700
Like no, as far as we know, we've known you for years.

53:54.700 --> 53:56.700
I understand you guys are joking right now.

53:56.700 --> 54:00.260
What is the value of chickens having a sense of time?

54:00.260 --> 54:03.900
Like that seems like the last thing you want those poor bees to have, right?

54:03.900 --> 54:09.780
I've been sitting here for what feels like a very great amount, like a great, a great

54:09.780 --> 54:10.780
span.

54:10.780 --> 54:11.780
Why can't they just sit and chill?

54:11.780 --> 54:12.780
Oh hello.

54:12.780 --> 54:13.780
Oh hello.

54:13.780 --> 54:16.020
Have you been here the whole time?

54:16.020 --> 54:19.720
For me Justin, it's not a sense of time, it's just more I'm disturbed by the lack

54:19.720 --> 54:21.100
of memory.

54:21.100 --> 54:26.820
Just the idea of like, a chicken goes to sleep, it wakes up somewhere else and it's like yeah,

54:26.820 --> 54:27.820
yeah this is it.

54:27.820 --> 54:28.820
This is right.

54:28.820 --> 54:29.820
Yeah that sounds about right.

54:29.820 --> 54:30.820
I wish that human beings had this.

54:30.820 --> 54:33.660
I feel like it would help out with mine and a lot of other people's social anxieties if

54:33.660 --> 54:36.740
I went to sleep next to my beautiful wife and I woke up.

54:36.740 --> 54:37.740
Who's that sitting in the chair?

54:37.740 --> 54:38.740
What's up?

54:38.740 --> 54:39.740
I'm Mark.

54:39.740 --> 54:40.740
Hi Mark.

54:40.740 --> 54:42.640
I guess.

54:42.640 --> 54:43.640
Are we like buds?

54:43.640 --> 54:44.640
Like yeah, I guess so.

54:44.640 --> 54:45.640
I just woke up here too.

54:45.640 --> 54:46.640
All right, cool.

54:46.640 --> 54:47.640
Do you want to go get-

54:47.640 --> 54:48.640
We've been friends forever?

54:48.640 --> 54:49.640
Is that what you're saying?

54:49.640 --> 54:50.640
Do you want some brunch?

54:50.640 --> 54:51.640
Is this a Saw movie?

54:51.640 --> 54:52.640
Are we on Saw now?

54:52.640 --> 54:53.640
Is this Saw?

54:53.640 --> 54:54.640
No.

54:54.640 --> 54:55.640
That thought wouldn't even like enter my mind.

54:55.640 --> 54:56.780
I woke up next to Mark.

54:56.780 --> 54:58.500
He must be pretty tight.

54:58.500 --> 54:59.980
You must have gone to sleep next to Mark.

54:59.980 --> 55:02.140
It's the only thing that makes sense.

55:02.140 --> 55:05.740
They say farm chickens have no memory.

55:05.740 --> 55:08.180
I guess their lives are much like mine, you know?

55:08.180 --> 55:11.620
In the little classic castle.

55:11.620 --> 55:13.780
Is a surprise every time.

55:13.780 --> 55:16.460
Wait, no Andy DeFranco fans here?

55:16.460 --> 55:18.820
No Andy DeFranco fans?

55:18.820 --> 55:22.100
Just a couple Warren G. heads.

55:22.100 --> 55:26.300
Hey Justin, I have another question for you.

55:26.300 --> 55:27.300
Hit me.

55:27.300 --> 55:32.380
Say I've been a Max Fund donor before.

55:32.380 --> 55:39.260
Say in the past I've been maybe a five or a 10 or a $20 a month or $35 a month donor.

55:39.260 --> 55:43.500
And every year it just seems like the Max Fund content is getting better and better

55:43.500 --> 55:44.500
and better.

55:44.500 --> 55:45.500
Maybe I've had a raise.

55:45.500 --> 55:48.300
Maybe it's just been a really good year for me.

55:48.300 --> 55:50.620
And I just wish I could give more.

55:50.620 --> 55:52.340
Is there a solution?

55:52.340 --> 55:53.340
Yeah there is.

55:53.340 --> 55:54.540
You just do it.

55:54.540 --> 55:57.540
You go up in there and you pledge that you're going to increase your gift.

55:57.540 --> 56:02.420
And if you increase your gift, let's say right now you're doing $5 a month and you're like,

56:02.420 --> 56:03.420
you know what?

56:03.420 --> 56:04.580
I'm going to get in there with $10 a month.

56:04.580 --> 56:09.020
You do that, you're going to get the gift associated with that higher level.

56:09.020 --> 56:10.020
Really?

56:10.020 --> 56:12.620
You're going to go in at 10, you're going to get your tote bag.

56:12.620 --> 56:16.200
You decide I'm going to up it to 20, you will get that in-flight power pack with the mobile

56:16.200 --> 56:20.580
device charger, collapsible water bottle, antibacterial wipes and pilot wings with Max

56:20.580 --> 56:22.260
Fund logos on them.

56:22.260 --> 56:25.580
Now say it's been a really good year.

56:25.580 --> 56:28.820
Like I just made partner at the firm.

56:28.820 --> 56:29.860
Are there higher level?

56:29.860 --> 56:35.540
If I really want to throw my money around like a big shot, are there higher levels?

56:35.540 --> 56:39.620
If you pledge $100 a month, you're going to get membership in the inner circle.

56:39.620 --> 56:45.740
That's a monthly culture club where Max Fund hosts pick something that they love and is

56:45.740 --> 56:50.220
really like something very special to them that they want to share with people and you

56:50.220 --> 56:52.860
get it in the mail like every month.

56:52.860 --> 56:56.140
You get it delivered to you because you're part of the inner circle.

56:56.140 --> 56:57.140
That's really cool.

56:57.140 --> 56:59.060
That's at $100 a month.

56:59.060 --> 57:06.180
For $200 a month, you get free registration to Max Fund Con 2016.

57:06.180 --> 57:07.180
Who's going to be there?

57:07.180 --> 57:08.180
It doesn't matter.

57:08.180 --> 57:09.300
You're going for free.

57:09.300 --> 57:10.300
And that's $200.

57:10.300 --> 57:16.020
You get the registration, the inner circle, the rocket engraved shot glasses, the in-flight

57:16.020 --> 57:20.980
power pack and the drive exclusive towback and all of the exclusive content.

57:20.980 --> 57:21.980
That's huge.

57:21.980 --> 57:23.420
So I think that's pretty huge.

57:23.420 --> 57:28.200
Also Justin, at $200 a month, Justin will come to your house and dance for you.

57:28.200 --> 57:29.280
Every day.

57:29.280 --> 57:30.600
Not every day.

57:30.600 --> 57:31.720
Just once.

57:31.720 --> 57:33.680
He'll pay for his own travel.

57:33.680 --> 57:36.060
He will get there and he will perform a dance, any style.

57:36.060 --> 57:38.320
It doesn't have to be seductive, but you'll probably want it to be.

57:38.320 --> 57:41.560
I can guarantee you he'll commit to it.

57:41.560 --> 57:44.740
This won't be like a half ass like, oh, let me do your dance.

57:44.740 --> 57:45.740
He's going to be up there.

57:45.740 --> 57:49.260
He's going to be moving and you're going to say, oh my God, I finally see what it means

57:49.260 --> 57:50.260
to dance.

57:50.260 --> 57:51.260
This is poetry.

57:51.260 --> 57:53.260
He's not going to be crying while he does the Macarena.

57:53.260 --> 57:54.260
No.

57:54.260 --> 57:55.260
Because that would ruin it.

57:55.260 --> 57:56.260
No.

57:56.260 --> 57:57.260
That would ruin the Macarena.

57:57.260 --> 57:59.260
I'm just reading this small print here and everything I just said was a lie.

57:59.260 --> 58:00.580
Justin will come dance for you.

58:00.580 --> 58:05.860
If you want to donate some cash, you can go to maximumfund.org slash donate.

58:05.860 --> 58:07.860
Maybe you started listening to some more shows.

58:07.860 --> 58:09.580
I know we added a ton of new shows.

58:09.580 --> 58:10.580
You know what we added this year?

58:10.580 --> 58:13.460
Let's say you're already a Brother My Brother fan, you know what we added this year?

58:13.460 --> 58:17.360
We added a show called Bunker Buddies that Travis does with his friend Andy.

58:17.360 --> 58:20.460
And we added a show called The Adventure Zone that we do with our dad.

58:20.460 --> 58:24.340
And we've continued to do amazing shows like Sawbones with Justin and Sidney.

58:24.340 --> 58:25.340
Thanks.

58:25.340 --> 58:27.720
But I'm saying like we've got new shows.

58:27.720 --> 58:29.900
There's maybe more things that you're listening to now.

58:29.900 --> 58:33.860
So maybe you want to kick in a few bucks to make that like, hey, I'll tell you what else.

58:33.860 --> 58:34.860
I'll tell you what else.

58:34.860 --> 58:35.860
What's that?

58:35.860 --> 58:38.700
You're gonna get more money than our dad doesn't get any of your money.

58:38.700 --> 58:39.700
That's true.

58:39.700 --> 58:43.420
We will leave him on the streets where we found him.

58:43.420 --> 58:45.980
Don't you want our daddy to have some money?

58:45.980 --> 58:48.780
And here's the thing that a lot of people miss about this.

58:48.780 --> 58:51.900
You are giving money to help maximumfund.org.

58:51.900 --> 58:54.220
You're supporting an amazing network of shows.

58:54.220 --> 59:00.120
But when you make your donation, you say what shows you love on the network.

59:00.120 --> 59:02.000
You say the shows that you listen to.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.780
Your money is going to those shows.

59:04.780 --> 59:08.420
You're directly supporting the people that create these programs.

59:08.420 --> 59:11.100
You're not only supporting a great network.

59:11.100 --> 59:15.500
Part of your money goes to all the great work Max Fund does and looking for new hosts and

59:15.500 --> 59:18.780
making the shows and doing all the great Max Fund stuff.

59:18.780 --> 59:22.220
But you're literally supporting the shows that you love so much.

59:22.220 --> 59:23.660
And it seriously means the world to us.

59:23.660 --> 59:29.880
And also, Adventure Zone would not exist without these donations because it has allowed us

59:29.880 --> 59:33.020
to spend more time working on podcasts.

59:33.020 --> 59:35.060
The money has allowed us to spend more time working on podcasts.

59:35.060 --> 59:36.660
The Adventure Zone wouldn't exist.

59:36.660 --> 59:38.140
Bunker Buddies wouldn't exist.

59:38.140 --> 59:39.940
We've been able to do live shows.

59:39.940 --> 59:42.700
We've been able to front the money for live shows, travel and stuff.

59:42.700 --> 59:47.940
I was able to move to Los Angeles specifically to try to develop more and more stuff for

59:47.940 --> 59:51.140
my brother, my brother, me and our other amazing shows.

59:51.140 --> 59:54.980
And not only that, let me also say this because we've been talking about money a lot.

59:54.980 --> 59:59.380
It means a lot to us to work for a listener-supported network.

59:59.380 --> 01:00:00.380
It's really great.

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:04.380
I talk to a lot of people who create a lot of content for a lot of different things.

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:09.980
And knowing that our listeners are also supporting our network and knowing that what we do means

01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:12.780
something to you guys means a lot to us.

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:17.420
And it's really amazing to be a part of this organization and be a part of you guys because

01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:18.420
that's the thing.

01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:20.580
When you become a donor, you become a part of Max Fund.

01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:22.220
And we're all in this together.

01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:26.280
We also have challenge donors who are current members who will pledge a small amount of

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.680
money for each new and upgrading member.

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:33.420
So even if you're coming in at the bottom level, you're coming in at $5 a month, first

01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:37.780
of all, there's nothing insignificant about that that's huge and awesome and we appreciate

01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:38.780
it.

01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:41.960
But it's also going to kick in a lot of money because there's a bunch of challenge donors

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:48.200
who are going to kick in a lot of money for every single new and upgrading member we have.

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:54.420
So really think about it because your donation is essentially doubled, if not tripled or

01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:55.420
quintupled.

01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:56.420
I don't know the math.

01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:57.420
I'm bad at it.

01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:02.220
I understand that financially it may not be possible for you to donate.

01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:03.680
That's totally fine.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:08.420
What we would ask though is if you can't donate, share that link around.

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:09.820
Tell other people to donate.

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:15.860
Maximumfund.org slash donate and say, hey, I can't do this well-heeled buddies, but maybe

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:18.780
you could throw these cats a few bucks.

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:21.140
Maximumfund.org forward slash donate.

01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:23.260
We love you just the same no matter what.

01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:24.260
You're still our buds.

01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:28.020
Do you guys want to know Yahoo?

01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:32.460
This Yahoo was sent in by Level9000, YaDruDruid, Drew Davenport.

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:33.460
Thank you, Drew.

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:37.740
I feel like maybe Shaman, we should go back to Shaman because it's a lot of Drew.

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:42.140
I think YaDruDruidDrew, it's too much.

01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:43.700
Should we call it just Yahoo?

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:44.700
We'll figure it out.

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:45.700
Yeah.

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:46.700
It's by YaDruAnswersUser.

01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:51.980
We'll run it through the boys in R and D. Blondies who ask, am I the only one annoyed

01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:55.180
about this at the fabric store?

01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:58.220
It's not that I'm really annoyed by it, but it happens every time.

01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:00.220
I'm already a little mea culpa.

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:01.220
Don't back off.

01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:02.220
Stick with this.

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:08.180
I'm not really annoyed by it, or that it happens at a fabric store.

01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:10.780
It's not that I'm annoyed by it, but it happens every time, and I'm curious to see if others

01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:11.940
have the same experience.

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:13.260
I go to the fabric store.

01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:14.260
Been going my whole life.

01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:15.260
Yep.

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:17.300
I'm a lifer.

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:23.300
I pick up my material, and once I go to have the gal cut my yardage, they ask me every

01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:27.640
time at every store, so whatcha makin'?

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:28.640
I kid you not.

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:31.300
This has happened each and every time I've visited the fabric shop.

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:38.140
Now I'm not a snoot and kindly say I'm making my Halloween costume, or I'm sewing doll clothes.

01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:40.540
Or I'm dressing as a doll for Halloween.

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:43.180
Or I'm making curtains for my new place.

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:44.180
But in all honesty-

01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:46.260
So people can't see me playing with my dolls.

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:52.660
But in all honesty, is it any of their goddamn fucking business what I'm using the fabric

01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:53.660
for?

01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:55.420
How much editorializing was there there, Griffin?

01:02:55.420 --> 01:03:01.660
They said damn business, but put that Griffin McElroy filthy mouth twist on it.

01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:02.660
Think about it.

01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:07.480
Again, I've never not told them why I'm buying the material, but why is it every single time?

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:15.660
If I was sewing a quilt to wrap my dead cat up in, you know?

01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:16.660
Why should they care?

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:20.300
Then you just say, I'm making a quilt.

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:21.300
Just leave it at that.

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:22.780
Why are you making a quilt though?

01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:23.780
For what specific purpose?

01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:27.200
For my dead cat, you insensitive bastards.

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:32.220
Even my newlywed husband, his first time at a fabric shop, walked out saying, why is it

01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:33.900
their business what you're making?

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:38.700
I laughed and said, sweetie, this happens every fucking time.

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:39.700
Welcome to the club.

01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:42.260
Anyways, am I the only one that experiences this?

01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:45.080
I love fabric stores, love the employees.

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:49.980
But why is it their fucking business to ask what you're making?

01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:55.820
Let me say, from working at CSE, I did buy a lot of fabric for like sets and stuff.

01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:56.820
This is true.

01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:58.700
You get asked a lot.

01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:04.100
And for me, it was always a little bit awkward because I would get to say things like, I'm

01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:09.280
going to make a blood splattered sheet, or like I'm making a fake wall.

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:13.460
And they'd always look at me like, oh, okay.

01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:15.140
But it's just doll clothes.

01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:17.800
Doll clothes and quilts for dead cats.

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.780
Next time you come in, can you just say doll clothes?

01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:22.100
It's a lot less psychically upsetting for us.

01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:25.540
We like routine here at the Michaels.

01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:30.140
Our hobby, our number one hobby here at the Hobby Lobby is just hearing you talk about

01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:32.300
the beautiful clothes you're making for your beautiful doll.

01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:36.940
In defense of the employees of these fabric stores, it's not like there's like a, it's

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:40.900
not a fast paced, high energy kind of store.

01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:41.900
You know what I mean?

01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:45.700
Their, their excitement comes from hearing the projects that you will be working.

01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:48.540
How much time is it taking out of your day?

01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:51.700
What kind of inconvenience is it to say like, I'm making doll clothes.

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:52.700
Okay.

01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:53.700
Great.

01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:54.700
Thank you for sharing with me.

01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:55.700
Just making conversation.

01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:56.700
You know what they can make in there?

01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:57.700
Nothing.

01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:58.780
They can make conversation.

01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:01.620
Please let them live vicariously through your creation.

01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:05.780
How come every time I go to the barber, they ask me how I want my hair cut?

01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:07.800
Is it any of their damn business?

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:14.300
We need to revisit this idea of the people who work at the Hobby Lobby, not being allowed

01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:19.300
to make things in the Hobby Lobby, but just because I think about that, that would pass

01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:20.300
without inspection.

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:23.820
But the opposite of an employee discount is the employee ban.

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:29.420
I grabbed that in my dragnet, Justin, because I'm imagining now all I can think about is

01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:34.380
the back room, the employee lounge at the Hobby Lobby, just people taking those like

01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:40.420
styrofoam balls and just seeing what kind of crazy shit they can get up to back there.

01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:42.820
We're doing a random locker check.

01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:46.620
Turn out any needles, pens, styrofoam balls.

01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:49.100
It's like a dystopian future back there.

01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:54.920
They can't, what you're missing, they can't create anything with their hands because they

01:05:54.920 --> 01:06:00.660
assume that they got, no matter what you have, like, okay, no matter what the physical object

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:07.500
is that you are creating, right, anything, they probably have the stuff for it at Michael's.

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:12.580
So any object, if someone sees you creating things, they have to check you when you go

01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:16.340
in and when you go out to make sure you don't have any other physical objects.

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:19.500
Because if you did, if they're like, well, what's this wallet?

01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:20.500
This is really nice.

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:24.020
Like, yeah, I bet you made it while you were here at Michael's.

01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:25.020
We have everything.

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:27.620
Is that why all the employees at Michael's work in their underwear?

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:28.620
Right.

01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:33.900
If you've ever wondered why they are naked with an apron, that is why.

01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:39.060
And have wires coming out of their head connected to the central processing unit to prevent

01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:40.060
thought crime.

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:41.820
That's the thing.

01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:47.700
You can't even create things with thoughts because they were inspired by like the macrame.

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:48.700
What are you making?

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:49.700
Doll clothes.

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:50.700
Oh, that gives me an idea.

01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:51.700
No, no, no.

01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:54.820
I mean, I mean, thank you very much.

01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:55.820
Have a great day.

01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:57.920
Thank you for shopping at Michael's.

01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:02.980
The only thing you're allowed to make at Hobby Lobby is babies because you don't have a

01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:03.980
choice.

01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:05.980
Because I got to have new employees.

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:08.940
Now, Justin, are you okay?

01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:14.260
Are you theorizing that they like sign an agreement to very like gulag totalitarian

01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:15.260
thing?

01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:16.260
Or?

01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:17.260
Not like goulash.

01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:18.260
Sorry.

01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:19.260
Is it a psychological torture?

01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:22.740
Wait, I just want to say, Griffin, that was a really, really funny joke.

01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:25.260
I'm glad you stopped Travis for it.

01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:28.900
That's what he deserved, and that joke deserved, and I love you for that.

01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:29.900
Thank you.

01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:31.020
I love you, too.

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:35.560
Or is it a psychological thing where they've just been told so many times that they cannot

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:40.020
create that they just believe it so intrinsically at this point.

01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:42.020
There's someone who's like, why don't you sew something?

01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:43.260
And they're like, I couldn't.

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:44.260
I couldn't.

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:45.260
I can't.

01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:46.260
Please leave.

01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:47.940
Just take your fabric and get out.

01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:49.500
Don't stir the pot.

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:53.960
Travis, most gorillas have been in captivity for so long.

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:57.020
They think that freedom is something they dreamed.

01:07:57.020 --> 01:08:02.580
That's a line from one of my favorite movies, Instinct, with Cuba Gooding Jr.

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:05.900
And it's something that I think applies really well to this situation.

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:14.020
Is it possibly a security protocol for in case they are using the fabric to make a dirty

01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:15.020
bomb?

01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:19.120
You're making a felty bomb.

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:20.120
We can tell.

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:21.980
It's a felty bomb.

01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:26.380
Or like, I don't know, a murder robe, a ceremonial murder robe.

01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:30.660
And you have to tell them, or else it's entrapment, what you're making.

01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:31.660
Sorry, what?

01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:32.780
You think entrapment works?

01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:37.740
If Michael's employee asks you what you're using the fabric for, and you are intending

01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:42.680
to make a dirty, felty bomb, you have to tell them, or else it's entrapment.

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:43.680
Know your rights, people.

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:46.500
If you don't know your rights, you're not going to be able to protect yourself out there.

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:47.500
What's that?

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:48.500
I'm playing Taps.

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:51.500
Oh, is it for the podcast?

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:54.700
No, not for the podcast.

01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:57.660
For a funeral for a friend.

01:08:57.660 --> 01:08:58.660
One last bit.

01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:02.780
One last time around the old corral, because everybody has fucking chompous flavor.

01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:06.900
We're going to try it out one last time, then it's fucking done.

01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:09.500
And don't ever ask about it again, because everybody ruined it.

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:14.740
And when you told people about it, when you told your Terry Gross about this great bit

01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:20.860
you heard on a podcast, Jerry Gross, I'm speaking to you, nephew of Terry Gross, when you told

01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:21.860
Terry about-

01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:22.860
I'm Scary Gross!

01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:32.340
Scary Gross is actually a really tight name for whoever takes Elvira's place.

01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:34.060
Just kidding, Elvira will live forever.

01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:38.740
This doll, it's Haunted Doll Watch, by the way.

01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:42.880
If you are so saddened by the death of Haunted Doll Watch, first of all, Haunted Dolls can't

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:43.880
really die.

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:47.340
Second of all, there's a Haunted Doll Watch bit in the Movin' Bam Bonus episode, so get

01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:49.340
at it.

01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:54.340
Classic Haunted Doll Katie Frieda.

01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:57.060
Extremely active, very rare spirit.

01:09:57.060 --> 01:10:02.220
Very rare spirit's weird to me, it seems like those are just one apiece, I believe.

01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:03.220
But anyway.

01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:06.180
Are you talking about like if you find them in the pack of Pokemon cards?

01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:10.860
No, I think you're saying like Travis McElroy is of course a very rare Travis McElroy.

01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:13.740
Oh, like you're only going to find one Travis McElroy.

01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:16.180
Like why are there multi-pack spirits?

01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:17.180
Anyway.

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:19.460
I got a hollow foil spirit.

01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:22.260
This doll has been a part of my spirit family for nearly a decade.

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:25.420
Can I say something about Haunted Doll Watch?

01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:26.420
Okay.

01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:27.420
What I'm going to miss the most.

01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:33.300
What I'm going to miss the most about Haunted Doll Watch is a lot of people ask me like

01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:35.140
where do you find this stuff, Justin?

01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:38.140
Like where are you getting this material from?

01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:41.980
Literally, I've never prepared for Haunted Doll Watch.

01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:47.400
As I've been sitting here, I type eBay.com and then I type Haunted Doll and I literally

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.860
read the first one and it's always the best.

01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:55.100
You type H-A-U into Google and it auto fills.

01:10:55.100 --> 01:11:00.800
It's such a rich vein, it was so easy, but now it's too, but it was too easy, you know?

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:05.160
You know how James Dean was too good at acting so God killed him?

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:06.160
It's like that.

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:07.160
That's exactly what happened.

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:10.500
So anyway, this doll is a needy and demanding spirit.

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:11.500
What's the doll's name?

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:15.860
Uh, this is Frida slash Katie and I'll explain that in a second.

01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:18.860
And now I feel there are a few that can deal with this special girl.

01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:24.020
By the way, I'm looking at the reader on her haunted energy and it's up to danger, so yeah.

01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:25.020
Uh oh.

01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:29.340
Justin, I hate to ask, I'm afraid to ask, could you share the link?

01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:37.820
Uh, yes, I can set you all up with the link to see Katie Frida or you could just Google

01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:42.740
and the first fucking thing you see when you search haunted doll, that's the one that you

01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:43.740
get.

01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:48.980
So anyway, uh, Katie and Frida, people sell haunted dolls on eBay, I'm sure you know that

01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:55.140
if you fucking read Vice or listen to Fresh Air or whatever, but uh, we profile some of

01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:56.140
those dolls.

01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:57.820
We're talking about Katie and Frida.

01:11:57.820 --> 01:11:59.900
Katie had a difficult and short life.

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:01.460
She was born and unloved.

01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:03.900
This abuse created a split in Katie's mind.

01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:07.700
She created another self to withstand the torture and abuse.

01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:11.580
This girl's name is Frida and is Katie's other self personality.

01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:18.060
Now I hear all you reaching for your fucking buy it now buttons after reading that shit,

01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:23.580
but I do have to warn you, this costs $150 to bring this into your life.

01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:27.780
Katie Frida passed away at six years old from neglect, abuse, and malnutrition.

01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:31.100
She died in the darkness at night and was very cold.

01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:33.480
Uh, excuse me?

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:35.460
Are you selling this?

01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:36.460
This is for sale?

01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:41.860
Are you, what kind of advertising are you doing with me right now?

01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:44.860
Frida has turned doorknobs on both bedroom doors.

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:47.540
Katie has shown me events through dream state that left me in tears.

01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:51.940
Okay, so it's sort of a double whammy, sort of all the shit that dolls can do, which is

01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:56.180
turning doorknobs spookily and also going on dream adventure.

01:12:56.180 --> 01:12:59.660
What if you're on a fucking dream adventure with your goddamn guardian angel and Katie

01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:00.660
rolls up?

01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:01.660
Hey, get out of here, Katie.

01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:03.380
This is my spooning.

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:09.320
Here is my favorite line, it goes through like all this stuff and it's honestly too

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:16.180
brutal to read on a quote unquote comedy show, but the last line is, I want to ensure Katie

01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:17.880
is in the best home possible.

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:21.500
Just like, fuck you, Frida, I don't care where Frida ends up.

01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:27.300
Frida can fuck off, but no, Katie is cool, $150 if you don't mind.

01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:29.460
Please be at least $25 to purchase.

01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:30.460
And rent a car.

01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:32.420
That's not the first time we've seen that warning.

01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:33.460
Some people aren't like-

01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:37.860
A 22 year old doesn't have the emotional maturity to deal with a Katie and or Frida.

01:13:37.860 --> 01:13:43.700
Guys, can I like, this listing is fucking great if you're not looking at it already.

01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:48.100
There are two pictures from the six or seven that are available here that look like they

01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:50.580
are snaps of Bigfoot.

01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:54.400
Like Katie or Frida was just like running across the room and they just like managed

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:55.820
to snap a pic of her.

01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:57.580
They're absolutely miserable pictures.

01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:02.060
I love the one with the scanner because it looks like Katie is saying, you ain't scanning

01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:03.980
me, are you?

01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:09.580
Let's talk about this ghost dollometer because I think it's some racist bullshit.

01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:15.540
Because this is the scanner, this is the metric that the ghost doll scanner, the ghost dollometer

01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:16.540
uses.

01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:21.420
There's safe, caution, and danger.

01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:26.140
So if there's a ghost in the doll, there's gonna be a ghost in the doll, there's a ghost

01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:29.300
in like half of the dolls that there are in the world.

01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:31.460
There's no setting on there to be like-

01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:32.460
But it's cool.

01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:35.580
There is a ghost in this, but they're totally cool.

01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:38.260
They also don't mention their return policy.

01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:39.980
No, no return policy.

01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:43.460
Hey listen, I bought that Katie Frida doll.

01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:48.300
It's like 75% Frida and I was expecting a 50-50 split.

01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:54.940
If you go to this listing for no other reason, make sure to stop by and see the picture of

01:14:54.940 --> 01:15:00.340
what appears to be Frida slash Katie, I'm assuming Frida, staring into a mirror while

01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:03.660
standing over a painting of the Virgin Mary.

01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:05.260
What is that look?

01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:06.260
What is happening?

01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:08.140
I don't see the Virgin Mary in this picture.

01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:09.140
Oh no.

01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:10.140
Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.

01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:11.140
The Haunted Dolls.

01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:13.860
Griffin was a haunted doll the whole time.

01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:20.940
Is it possible that the resurgence in Haunted Doll, and by resurgence I mean-

01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:21.940
Surgence.

01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:22.940
Pre-surgence.

01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:23.940
Pre-most surgence.

01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:34.220
Of Haunted Dolls in the media's eye, ever watchful eye, is going to lead to one person

01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:39.340
who buys these dolls up for the sole purpose of destroying them and making our world a

01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:41.220
safer and better place.

01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:42.220
Possible.

01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:43.540
I hope that that's what happens.

01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:50.860
I mean more likely though is we are fucking kicked right back to Beanie Baby fever mid-90s.

01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:52.900
People are gobbling these things up like crazy.

01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:59.220
They're spending way too much just assuming that they're going to get the investment back

01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:00.220
at some point.

01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:01.220
Not even thinking about-

01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:03.100
They even got the Haunted Dolls that come in the McDonald's Kids Meals.

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:04.100
You know what I mean?

01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:05.100
Right.

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:06.100
They're collecting all the Haunted Dolls.

01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:09.900
Clearing out the college funds just to buy Stephanie slash Gordo or whatever the Haunted

01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:11.100
Doll is.

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:12.180
That's what I think.

01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:19.380
My hope is that once the smoke clears on Haunted Dolls, we can swoop back in there.

01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:21.980
It'll be retro at that point or something.

01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:24.140
We'll be doing it ironically, I think.

01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:26.660
That's the only hope for more Haunted Dolls.

01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:27.660
That's what I think is the future.

01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:32.540
At that point, Katie slash Frito will be 36 years old and she'll be like, I just would

01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:33.540
like to get a job.

01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:37.140
She's like the mayor of Portland or something.

01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:38.140
You guys want a yahoo?

01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:39.140
Yes.

01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:40.140
Yes.

01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:44.420
This yahoo was sent in by Dan Green who asks, nope, he didn't ask it, fucked that right

01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:45.420
up, didn't I?

01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:51.120
It's by yahoo answers user Rishi who asks, how can I fight well against a guy I took

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:53.140
under my wing?

01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:55.740
To put it simply, I need help badly.

01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:59.540
I practice Jeet Kune Do, a self-defense martial art.

01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:04.160
I've been going for nearly seven years and I've come a long way since then.

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:05.940
I'm now the best teen in my class.

01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:07.580
I'm 15 by the way.

01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:11.580
Who at eight is like, I'm gonna get into Jeet Kune Do.

01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:15.420
However, a year ago, another guy the same age as me started learning and I basically

01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:18.980
taught him and he was learning the ropes, nothing bad about that.

01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:23.460
But when it came to sparring, I gave him all my killer secrets to fighting well.

01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:27.840
As we became good friends, we sparred more together, now he uses all my tactics that

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:31.620
I taught and develops it and now he's better than me by far.

01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:37.060
I get completely whitewashed and he masters all the special traps I learn in an instant

01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:40.660
whilst I can barely do them with three weeks of solid practice.

01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:44.020
It's also frustrating as now my confidence has dropped because of this and my mind goes

01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:45.260
blank whenever I spar.

01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:49.340
I can't think of any tactics to use and he just keeps getting better and better by the

01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:50.340
day.

01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:52.980
Can you guys give any advice to me on how I can get my ferocity back?

01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:54.540
All help is useful, thank you.

01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:56.940
This is so classic.

01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:58.220
It's a person of his own creation.

01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:01.100
It's so obvious what's going on.

01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:03.760
He is the chosen one, right?

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:07.740
It's a classic storyline, the person who's worked really hard like trying to become the

01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:13.640
chosen one and then somebody just like ghosts in and it's like, but he gets everything instantly.

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:15.420
He's not working for it, right?

01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:17.140
And I'm supposed to train him?

01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:19.420
I should have been the chosen one.

01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:21.100
He's the last, last dragon.

01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:22.100
Yes.

01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:23.740
And he took the globe from you.

01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:24.740
Yes.

01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:26.580
So I think you should kill him.

01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:27.580
Whoa.

01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:28.580
Whoa.

01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:30.100
Now I know it seems extreme.

01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:33.140
Yeah, like the most extreme thing you can do in any given situation.

01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:36.500
But that's the only way that she's going to be able to become the chosen one.

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:37.620
Or he.

01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:41.440
It's definitely a guy just based on their avatar.

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:43.020
How can you tell from the avatar?

01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:45.300
Are they like spraying on some acts or something?

01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:51.700
I think we have like a, um, how can you give me, do me a favor, you two go try to get in

01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:56.340
a fight with a mirror and when you can't do it because they block your blows with their

01:18:56.340 --> 01:18:57.340
own blows.

01:18:57.340 --> 01:18:58.340
Yes.

01:18:58.340 --> 01:19:01.300
But Griffin in this scenario, the mirror is kicking his ass.

01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:02.300
Well yeah.

01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:03.300
Cause it's a bet.

01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:04.300
It's a haunted mirror.

01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:05.300
Oh.

01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:12.180
The, what they did, uh, taskmaster, you know, on Spider-Man unlimited that cartoon taskmaster

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:17.100
is a character that like learns your fighting style immediately as he watches you fight

01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:21.460
and you like, nobody can beat him in a fight cause they like, he knows all your moves.

01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:24.460
He, he watches you fight, right?

01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:28.600
And then as he's watching you do the moves, he flips it on you and does the moves back

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:30.260
on you and better.

01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:34.940
So what I'm saying is he's basically the, the Terry Gross of fighting guys.

01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:35.940
Okay.

01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:38.900
But listen, here's how they beat him, right?

01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:42.380
Spider-Man switched costumes with somebody else.

01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:48.860
Spider-Man dressed up like, uh, Iron Fist and then they did each other's combat moves.

01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:50.460
So he didn't know where it was coming from.

01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:54.780
So wait, was there a moment when Iron Fist saw like Peter Parker like straight up and

01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:55.780
was like, oh great.

01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:56.780
Saw his dick and everything.

01:19:56.780 --> 01:19:57.780
He took his pants off.

01:19:57.780 --> 01:20:00.320
No, they all, they all know.

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:02.700
They live with Aunt Meg so they all like know the story.

01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:03.700
Oh, I gotcha.

01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:04.700
Yeah.

01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:05.700
I haven't.

01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:08.220
So what you're saying, Justin, is the classic, like if, if he knows what you're going to

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:11.420
do next, do the last thing he would expect.

01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:16.220
And if, and if like, if your normal move is that you go like high, high, low chop, right?

01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:21.980
Just like stroke his shoulder, quarter circle punch, then maybe like, you know, like this

01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:25.460
time like go and he won't know what to make of it.

01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:28.540
And then you punch him in the gut, but he is going to know what to make of that.

01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:32.540
You in the middle, you will go and he's already going to know what the fuck you're doing.

01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:34.500
You have to get outside of your own head.

01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:36.300
How's this for a suggestion?

01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:39.260
Get out there to spar and he's like, let's go.

01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:40.260
Let's go, Sensei.

01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:41.780
And he's saying that tauntingly.

01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:42.780
Ooh, what a jerk.

01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:43.780
I hate that.

01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:44.980
And then he, but then you're like, oh, hold on.

01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:45.980
I got to piss.

01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:50.300
And you go to the bathroom and then while you're in the bathroom, do a whip it and then

01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:53.260
go back out there and you're real fucked up.

01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:56.580
You're going to be real fucked up and he's, you're not going to be inside your own head.

01:20:56.580 --> 01:20:58.500
So he's not going to be allowed in there.

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:01.380
He's going to be like, all right, time to do the thing that I did that you taught me.

01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:03.180
And you're like, how about this new thing?

01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:04.180
And you hit him.

01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:06.020
And you sit down and take him out.

01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:09.660
And you hit him with the backside of your bicep and he's like, that wasn't effective,

01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:13.860
but I didn't see it coming.

01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:15.100
Are you okay?

01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:16.100
You're like really wavering.

01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:18.500
You're kind of wobbling on your feet.

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:22.580
It's like drunken master shit, but whip it.

01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:23.580
Whip it, Master.

01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:24.580
You're 15.

01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:28.460
You can't buy alcohol, but you can probably get some whip it somewhere.

01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:29.820
Somebody you know has whip it.

01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:33.120
Folks, that's going to do it for us on our podcast.

time to go listen to the other shows.

I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's

I feel like we don't thank them enough, even though we do every episode.

01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:50.180
Every single.

01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:51.880
We should be thanking them three to four times an episode.

01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:52.880
You're right, Travis.

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:53.880

Y'all want a Final Yahoo?

This Final Yahoo was sent in by Dave Page.

01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:13.300
Thank you, Dave.

01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:22.180
It's by Yahoo Answers user Antoine Grady, who asks, is it just me, or has Britney Spears

01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:24.820
been replaced as one of pop music's top stars?

01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:28.460
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:29.460
I'm Travis McElroy.

It's been my brother, my brother.

01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:53.860
May you kiss your dad's square on the lips.

01:23:53.860 --> 01:24:05.780
Did you guys like that?

01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:07.860
Did you, the listener, like that?

01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:11.860
You were just swept up in a world of high fantasy and magic where anything can happen

01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:13.020
and anything is possible.

01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:17.500
