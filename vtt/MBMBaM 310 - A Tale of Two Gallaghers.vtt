00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:43.920
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna, just say, hey, I wanna.

00:43.920 --> 00:47.120
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother Amin, and Vice show for the modern era.

00:47.120 --> 00:50.880
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:50.880 --> 00:57.680
I'm that sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. And America's battling back for her birthday.

00:57.680 --> 01:03.520
And that's right, America's birthday is here, and America, we're coming back.

01:04.240 --> 01:08.640
But we're coming back because a lot of other people are soon to be dropping the ball right now,

01:08.640 --> 01:12.320
and America's just gonna sneak in there and reclaim his glory by default.

01:13.440 --> 01:16.160
I'm looking around at the world today, I'm seeing a lot of nations just kind of

01:16.160 --> 01:18.960
screwing the pooch. But we're back.

01:18.960 --> 01:23.360
Basically, America's like moving up the education standards list because

01:23.360 --> 01:26.000
suddenly every other country forgot how to read.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.840
Which is one way to do it. It's one way to climb that old ladder in it.

01:29.840 --> 01:33.200
You don't have to be the fastest, you just have to run the longest.

01:33.200 --> 01:33.520
Right.

01:33.520 --> 01:41.040
For her birthday. So America's back, and I just couldn't be happier to be from this great thumb

01:41.040 --> 01:44.800
on earth. It's a kind of thumb shape. You ever try to draw America?

01:44.800 --> 01:46.000
Man, it's so hard.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.520
Hard, it's really hard.

01:47.520 --> 01:51.040
Let me ask you this, Justin. What did you get America for her birthday?

01:51.040 --> 01:56.400
Uh, I got America was, um, Amazon Echoes.

01:56.400 --> 01:56.720
Nice.

01:57.520 --> 01:58.000
Nice.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.120
I got, um...

01:59.120 --> 02:06.320
I put it in Kansas because I wanted it to be, like, sorta central.

02:06.320 --> 02:11.520
In the middle of it, yeah. And that way everyone can use it. You just, hey everybody,

02:11.520 --> 02:15.200
real quick, stop the podcast, stop whatever you're doing, just yell at Kansas real quick.

02:15.200 --> 02:19.920
Just be like, how do you convert 90 degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius?

02:19.920 --> 02:23.520
Or, play Dave Matthews Band! Do you hear me, Kansas?

02:26.080 --> 02:32.400
I forgot it was America's birthday again, and so I just went into the sheets and I got,

02:32.400 --> 02:36.640
like, a teddy bear, and there's a little compartment, and it's belly for jelly beans.

02:36.640 --> 02:36.880
Nice.

02:36.880 --> 02:37.600
So, I bet.

02:37.600 --> 02:43.760
I got America a Million XL t-shirt that says,

02:43.760 --> 02:47.600
I'm with Stupid, and then there's arrows pointing in all directions.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.560
Oh, that's great. Sort of a global burn.

02:50.560 --> 02:54.800
Yeah. You know, it's important when you get a present for someone that you don't get the

02:54.800 --> 02:57.360
present you want. You get the present they want.

02:58.000 --> 02:58.640
Too true, Travis, too true.

02:58.640 --> 03:04.320
And I felt like I wouldn't wear that giant ass t-shirt, but maybe America would, you know?

03:05.200 --> 03:06.960
Plus it was on sale.

03:06.960 --> 03:09.760
You'd be crushed to death under the shirt, I think, Travis.

03:09.760 --> 03:12.080
It's so large. It's got a thick weave.

03:12.640 --> 03:16.400
A thick weave to cover this beautiful nation of ours. Which, let's be honest,

03:16.400 --> 03:21.120
I don't want to be a prude, but this nation's been too nude, too furious, for too long.

03:21.840 --> 03:22.080
Yeah.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.320
It's got bumps and humps and lumps everywhere.

03:25.600 --> 03:29.680
Here's a fun fact. Here's a quick fun fact. Since we're talking about America,

03:29.680 --> 03:31.680
it's this beautiful lady's birthday.

03:33.280 --> 03:38.640
The center of the U.S. is the actual, like, geographical center of it, right?

03:38.640 --> 03:43.040
It's in this place called Lebanon, Kansas, or two miles northwest, I guess.

03:43.040 --> 03:46.080
So this is not the incredible fact I wanted to tell you.

03:46.080 --> 03:50.400
There's a very tiny chapel there. Like, really, really small.

03:50.400 --> 03:53.280
Like, four pews. Small, right?

03:54.080 --> 03:58.560
There's a chapel there, but there's a little note that's set on this page I'm reading about.

03:58.560 --> 04:04.480
It says, the U.S. geographic center chapel was destroyed by a speeding vehicle

04:04.480 --> 04:09.840
missing the turn at the T intersection at the end of K-191 Highway on June 1st, 2008.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.600
It's since been replaced by a new chapel.

04:11.600 --> 04:17.280
I want nothing more. I'll tell you what, America, when my birthday comes around,

04:17.280 --> 04:20.320
I want to hear the story that leads to this.

04:20.320 --> 04:23.920
Like, guys, guys, I'm blazed.

04:23.920 --> 04:29.360
We're going to go drive through the center of America and just plow through that tiny church.

04:29.360 --> 04:29.920
Yeah.

04:29.920 --> 04:31.200
Come on, don't be an idiot.

04:31.200 --> 04:34.640
Well, here's the thing. They didn't say who was driving that car.

04:34.640 --> 04:37.360
The answer is Joe Biden. Let me walk it back for you.

04:37.360 --> 04:46.160
Joseph Gordon Biden, the vice principal of America, he had this amazing idea.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.440
And he called me up and he told me about it.

04:47.440 --> 04:49.040
And let me relay the idea.

04:49.040 --> 04:53.280
The plan, because now it's more of a plan because it's him taking action.

04:53.280 --> 04:56.320
Step one, just get rid of that old chapel, he said.

04:56.320 --> 04:58.080
We got to get rid of that old chapel.

04:58.080 --> 05:00.400
He'd been listening to American Gods.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.960
I'm going to drive my stang through it, he said.

05:02.960 --> 05:04.720
And I was like, fuck, yeah, Joey.

05:04.720 --> 05:07.280
And so he drove his stang right through it and destroyed it.

05:07.280 --> 05:09.360
And then he called up Barack Obama.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.720
I'm sorry, Barack Hussein Obama.

05:10.720 --> 05:11.680
It's important a lot of people forget.

05:13.040 --> 05:15.360
And said, here's my idea.

05:15.360 --> 05:20.640
There's a new plot of real estate that just opened up centrally located, Barry.

05:21.920 --> 05:26.240
And from this position, the new White House in the center of America,

05:26.240 --> 05:28.560
you'll be able to get to wherever you need to go.

05:28.560 --> 05:31.120
Like the easiest you could possibly do it.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.800
Unless where you need to go is D.C.

05:34.800 --> 05:37.360
At which point being in D.C. would probably have been easy.

05:37.360 --> 05:38.480
It'd probably be a little bit better.

05:38.480 --> 05:41.040
But D.C. is so far on the East Coast.

05:41.040 --> 05:45.520
It's like if you need to get to like Montana, it's going to take forever.

05:49.200 --> 05:52.720
So we're just not going to mention the fact that

05:53.360 --> 05:56.400
Griffin called Joe Biden the vice principal of America, right?

05:58.240 --> 05:58.960
That's what he is.

05:58.960 --> 06:02.400
Like you think about the typical sort of school structure, right?

06:02.400 --> 06:05.040
The principal all about big picture ideas,

06:05.040 --> 06:06.960
all about sort of like leading the school,

06:06.960 --> 06:10.640
guiding them, giving them a hope, something to aspire to.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.960
The vice principal, that's the ass kicker, isn't it?

06:12.960 --> 06:14.160
That's the disciplinarian.

06:16.720 --> 06:19.920
I was thinking that you either have your hard-nosed principal

06:19.920 --> 06:23.440
that no one gets along with and you're kind of soft and friendly vice principal,

06:23.440 --> 06:25.200
or you have like your bad-ass vice principal.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.640
But the thing is, my question is this, Griffin.

06:28.640 --> 06:33.360
Do you think that they discuss that like when a new vice principal gets hired

06:33.360 --> 06:35.520
and the principal is like, listen, I'm the bad-ass.

06:36.160 --> 06:36.560
No, no, no.

06:36.560 --> 06:40.640
It was definitely like Barack Hussein Obama like walked into Joey's garage

06:40.640 --> 06:42.560
and was like, listen, we need to figure this out.

06:42.560 --> 06:46.640
And then like he wheeled himself out from underneath the stang that he was kitting up.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.920
And he was like, I'll do it.

06:48.640 --> 06:49.140
I'll do it.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.720
You sound like Dominic Toretto there for a second.

06:52.720 --> 06:54.800
Oh, he is basically, yeah.

06:54.800 --> 06:59.760
Yeah, anyway, happy birthday, you big beautiful lady.

07:00.960 --> 07:03.920
Did we release this on the 4th of July?

07:03.920 --> 07:04.720
Probably not.

07:05.600 --> 07:09.120
This one's probably going to go up on the 5th unless one of you boys wants to edit it.

07:09.120 --> 07:10.560
No, not really.

07:11.840 --> 07:12.480
You know what, guys?

07:12.480 --> 07:17.280
We've been sort of slacking on questions per episode or QPE.

07:17.280 --> 07:20.080
Well, we're like seven and a half minutes into this one already.

07:20.080 --> 07:21.920
So I think this one's shaping up to be another-

07:21.920 --> 07:23.280
It's better than Ray Donovan.

07:23.280 --> 07:26.800
Ray Donovan, we were like 15 minutes in before we answered a question.

07:26.800 --> 07:27.280
That's true.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.680
But with that, I want to up our QPE this episode.

07:29.680 --> 07:30.320
Let's get right into it.

07:30.320 --> 07:32.240
One note about Ray Donovan, if I may.

07:33.040 --> 07:33.600
Please stop.

07:34.240 --> 07:35.840
Okay, you go ahead first.

07:35.840 --> 07:36.960
And then I have a second note.

07:36.960 --> 07:38.000
Maybe they're the same note.

07:38.000 --> 07:38.880
Please go ahead, Griffin.

07:38.880 --> 07:44.080
I was watching Unreal, terrific show on my Lifetime app,

07:44.080 --> 07:47.120
which I'm probably not going to use for anything else.

07:47.120 --> 07:48.560
Thank you, Lifetime.

07:48.560 --> 07:51.840
And they apparently are sort of the same sort of family as Showtime.

07:51.840 --> 07:54.320
So I did see a trailer for Ray Donovan.

07:54.320 --> 07:57.600
And upon seeing it, I just kind of went, huh.

07:59.760 --> 08:00.720
So that's what he is.

08:01.600 --> 08:02.960
So that's the thing.

08:02.960 --> 08:08.080
Very few toilets, much more punching celebrities and things.

08:08.080 --> 08:09.440
So, wonderful.

08:09.440 --> 08:11.920
We specifically asked on that episode,

08:11.920 --> 08:15.360
please don't send us Ray Donovan related links and materials.

08:15.360 --> 08:19.920
And do you know how many motherfucking Ray Donovan pictures

08:19.920 --> 08:23.840
any time a Ray Donovan has hoved into everyone's field of vision,

08:23.840 --> 08:25.680
they have submitted it to the Facebook group.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.200
Please, no more.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.960
I'm not going to approve your Ray Donovan.

08:28.960 --> 08:29.840
And you know what?

08:29.840 --> 08:31.680
Stop submitting the mac and cheese thing.

08:31.680 --> 08:32.720
I did that last week.

08:32.720 --> 08:33.760
Okay, now we're done.

08:33.760 --> 08:36.000
Now, QPE up.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.360
This is an advice show.

08:37.360 --> 08:39.360
We turn your advice, Alchemy like it,

08:39.360 --> 08:41.360
and questions Alchemy like into wisdom.

08:41.360 --> 08:42.160
So here we go.

08:42.880 --> 08:45.840
Hey brothers, my friend brought me a leg of lamb

08:45.840 --> 08:49.440
she found in a supermarket dumpster as a house gift

08:49.440 --> 08:51.120
when she came to stay for a couple of days.

08:51.920 --> 08:54.000
She didn't mention it came from a dumpster

08:54.640 --> 08:56.560
until I cooked it and served it.

08:56.560 --> 08:57.280
Is this okay?

08:58.320 --> 08:59.440
Thanks, Joe.

08:59.440 --> 09:02.400
All right, let's just keep that QPE up.

09:02.400 --> 09:03.920
No, this is terrible, Joe.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.440
Your friendship is dissolved.

09:05.440 --> 09:06.560
I dissolve it.

09:06.560 --> 09:08.000
This is legally binding.

09:08.000 --> 09:08.800
It's over.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.080
I want to address something here

09:10.080 --> 09:12.960
because there is a movement in the world

09:12.960 --> 09:16.720
where grocery stores and the sell by date and all that shit,

09:16.720 --> 09:18.400
they get rid of perfectly good food.

09:18.400 --> 09:19.920
And like, this is no joke

09:19.920 --> 09:22.480
that there's a huge food waste in America.

09:22.480 --> 09:29.680
That said, the issue here is that she did not fucking tell you.

09:29.680 --> 09:32.240
She was like that woman who murders her husband

09:32.240 --> 09:35.440
and then serves it to the detectives, you know?

09:36.400 --> 09:37.520
That's what's going on here.

09:37.520 --> 09:39.200
She knew she had committed a crime

09:39.200 --> 09:41.920
and she waited till you consume the evidence to tell you.

09:41.920 --> 09:43.040
Yeah, yes.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.760
Yes, if she had mentioned it afterwards,

09:45.760 --> 09:48.400
she knows she committed a crime.

09:48.400 --> 09:51.040
The thing is, from my bigger hang up,

09:51.040 --> 09:54.400
is a leg of lamb is not a thing I would eat out of a dumpster.

09:54.400 --> 09:59.840
If somebody throws a carrot into a compost heap

09:59.840 --> 10:02.400
and it's there for less than five minutes

10:02.400 --> 10:04.080
and then somebody fishes it out of there,

10:04.080 --> 10:05.600
gives it a good old scrub down

10:05.600 --> 10:08.160
and then chops it up and makes like a little stew for me,

10:08.160 --> 10:09.920
I ain't mad at you.

10:09.920 --> 10:11.600
A leg of lamb is like,

10:11.600 --> 10:19.280
there's so many ways that that protein could be compromised by the dumpster gas.

10:19.280 --> 10:19.520
Yeah.

10:20.880 --> 10:24.080
And also, if your friend wasn't up front with you,

10:24.080 --> 10:27.040
you also can't trust your friend when asked the question,

10:27.040 --> 10:30.000
how long was it in the dumpster before you got it?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.520
Your friend is going to lie.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.680
Yeah, don't get it mistaken.

10:33.680 --> 10:38.240
You could no longer trust this friend for anything ever again.

10:38.240 --> 10:41.600
Did you lock the apartment door before we left?

10:41.600 --> 10:42.480
Oh yeah, totally.

10:42.480 --> 10:43.840
Okay, so then you didn't.

10:43.840 --> 10:46.800
Then you basically just confessed that you didn't do that.

10:46.800 --> 10:49.120
Hey, you paid for this bag of Skittles we're both eating right now.

10:49.120 --> 10:49.920
Oh yeah, for sure.

10:49.920 --> 10:52.400
So you shoplifted it from Sheets.

10:52.400 --> 10:52.720
Great.

10:52.720 --> 10:53.760
Oh, wonderful.

10:53.760 --> 10:54.880
No, but this is great, Griffin.

10:54.880 --> 10:57.040
It's like, one of them always tells the truth,

10:57.040 --> 10:58.320
one of them always tells the lie.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.560
Now, if you look at your friend and you ask them a question,

11:00.560 --> 11:03.840
they say you always know that the answer is the opposite of what they said.

11:03.840 --> 11:07.520
Yeah, I don't want anybody to conscript me

11:07.520 --> 11:12.000
into their efforts on anything via secret food.

11:14.160 --> 11:15.360
You know what would make me mad?

11:15.360 --> 11:19.680
If someone made a meal for me and I ate it and then they're like,

11:19.680 --> 11:22.480
you would never guess this, but that was vegetarian.

11:23.280 --> 11:26.240
And I'm sitting there with a full belly and then I'd be like,

11:26.880 --> 11:28.320
okay, you would never guess this,

11:28.320 --> 11:32.480
but now I have to go find some meat so I could have had dinner.

11:32.480 --> 11:35.520
Oh, you're on that B-I-I-N-G-O plan,

11:35.520 --> 11:37.680
that bingo plan from The Biggest Loser.

11:37.680 --> 11:38.880
The boy on The Biggest Loser,

11:38.880 --> 11:41.280
whose parents were trying to get him to drop a few LBs,

11:41.280 --> 11:44.080
so they made a little veggie puree and hid it in his meatloaf.

11:44.080 --> 11:44.880
And they're like, did you like that?

11:44.880 --> 11:46.000
He was like, yeah, it was real yummy.

11:46.000 --> 11:46.960
Thanks, mom.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.800
She was like, there's cauliflower in that.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.080
And he just goes silent and says,

11:50.880 --> 11:52.400
don't you ever fucking do that to me.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.960
Like, this boy's demeanor changed.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.560
And in this moment, he was not bingo.

11:56.560 --> 11:58.960
He was like, Mark, something like-

11:58.960 --> 11:59.600
Sounds different.

11:59.600 --> 12:03.440
Don't you ever fucking do that to me again.

12:04.720 --> 12:05.200
I agree.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.840
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

12:07.840 --> 12:09.120
Absolutely, Griffin.

12:09.120 --> 12:10.240
Absolutely, I do.

12:10.880 --> 12:13.040
This one was sent in by Rachel Rosen.

12:13.040 --> 12:15.120
Game recognized that game for me real quick.

12:15.120 --> 12:15.680
Thank you, Rachel.

12:15.680 --> 12:17.760
It's by Yahoo Answers user JJ, who asks,

12:20.480 --> 12:22.880
I see orbs when I play my guitar.

12:24.720 --> 12:24.960
What?

12:24.960 --> 12:27.440
Today, I saw something strange

12:27.440 --> 12:29.680
while watching a recording of myself playing my guitar.

12:29.680 --> 12:32.240
I recorded the video in slow-mo on my phone

12:32.240 --> 12:33.840
to see the strings vibrate.

12:33.840 --> 12:34.720
It's really cool.

12:34.720 --> 12:35.200
Cool.

12:35.200 --> 12:38.880
But I noticed a small white orb pop into frame

12:38.880 --> 12:40.320
directly on my fretboard.

12:40.320 --> 12:41.600
Started from the 15th fret

12:41.600 --> 12:43.600
and traveled down the neck to the fifth fret.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.040
It moved fast as hell too.

12:45.040 --> 12:47.120
It reminded me of a shooting star the way it moved.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.560
Then it hovered for a second

12:48.560 --> 12:50.240
and then at a much slower pace

12:50.240 --> 12:52.640
floated around the strings in a spiraling motion.

12:52.640 --> 12:53.680
Was it just dust?

12:53.680 --> 12:55.280
A spirit who wants to jam?

12:55.280 --> 12:58.160
I'd love to hear some theories on it.

12:58.160 --> 13:00.560
Oh, is that your first time seeing the spirit of music?

13:01.120 --> 13:01.600
Yeah.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.280
You know that's a literal thing, right?

13:03.280 --> 13:06.080
Like there's a reason why Santana does what he does.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.160
He can't help himself.

13:08.160 --> 13:09.040
He can't help himself.

13:09.040 --> 13:10.560
The spirit is moving him.

13:10.560 --> 13:13.440
I mean, I love the idea of it as a spirit who wants to jam.

13:13.440 --> 13:14.720
And it's like you watch that video

13:14.720 --> 13:20.000
and you transcribe the orb's movements to like tabulature.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.760
And then you're like, all right, let's try this out.

13:21.760 --> 13:24.080
Today is gonna be the day that the...

13:24.080 --> 13:26.720
Ah, it's Wonderwall, fucking orb.

13:26.720 --> 13:29.360
The trick is it's always Wonderwall.

13:29.360 --> 13:31.280
Oh, it is always, yeah.

13:31.280 --> 13:33.680
That's the only song the spirit of music is ever like.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.960
The spirit of music has a very outdated taste in music,

13:36.960 --> 13:38.080
which is very ironic.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.400
My favorite running joke to do

13:40.400 --> 13:42.880
is whenever I'm in a car and Oasis is playing

13:42.880 --> 13:45.360
and it's either Wonderwall or Don't Look Back in Anger

13:45.360 --> 13:46.560
because despite the fact that they're like

13:46.560 --> 13:49.440
apparently the most popular British band since the Beatles,

13:49.440 --> 13:51.520
like that's all the two songs they did.

13:51.520 --> 13:54.160
I just pretend like, oh, who is this?

13:54.160 --> 13:55.200
I like this.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.320
I like this kind spirit thing.

13:58.320 --> 13:59.680
What do you call this?

14:00.480 --> 14:02.400
You gotta be careful with the spirit of music

14:02.400 --> 14:04.960
because if I know anything from lore,

14:04.960 --> 14:07.200
it's that those spirits,

14:07.200 --> 14:10.560
they got no respect for human physical limitations.

14:10.560 --> 14:11.360
Sure.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.280
And they will make you play the strings too fast

14:13.280 --> 14:15.280
till your fingers bleed or dance too hard

14:15.280 --> 14:18.000
till your toes fall off or something.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.760
And they'll make you play Wonderwall

14:19.760 --> 14:21.680
and they'll make you play Wonderwall

14:21.680 --> 14:24.160
until your skin is just shredded

14:24.160 --> 14:26.080
like you shredded those sick notes.

14:26.080 --> 14:27.440
That's what happened to Pete Townsend.

14:27.440 --> 14:28.400
He was bedeviled.

14:29.120 --> 14:31.120
He was bedeviled every time he got on that stage.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.800
I got blisters on my fingers.

14:32.800 --> 14:34.240
Damn you, cruel spirit.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.120
Please kill me.

14:35.680 --> 14:36.160
Please.

14:36.160 --> 14:37.280
I'm bedeviled.

14:37.280 --> 14:38.880
You think, but you gotta be good.

14:38.880 --> 14:41.840
You gotta be like careful with that

14:41.840 --> 14:45.680
because if you do wrong by the spirit of music,

14:45.680 --> 14:50.400
if you were to say, I can't play this right now,

14:50.400 --> 14:52.720
my fingers are falling off, then I leave you.

14:52.720 --> 14:54.400
You know, it abandoned you

14:54.400 --> 14:56.400
and forced you to create the music on your own.

14:56.400 --> 14:59.040
Just like it happened to the Oasis brothers.

14:59.040 --> 15:03.040
And Chinese democracy took that long because slash and axle.

15:03.040 --> 15:05.280
And it still wasn't very good

15:05.280 --> 15:08.000
because they couldn't really find that spirit again, could they?

15:08.720 --> 15:10.480
They tried to fake it by like just,

15:11.040 --> 15:12.240
those weren't notes.

15:12.240 --> 15:14.160
Half of Chinese democracy is not music

15:14.160 --> 15:15.600
because they couldn't do that.

15:15.600 --> 15:16.400
So they had to fill it.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.640
That's why there's so many Chris Tucker skits

15:19.360 --> 15:20.720
on Chinese democracy

15:20.720 --> 15:22.160
because they didn't have enough songs.

15:23.200 --> 15:26.480
If you slow down, like put it in like 4,000 frames a second,

15:26.480 --> 15:28.080
slow, slow, slow-mo,

15:28.080 --> 15:31.840
that video of 10 minutes of Axl Rose during a live concert

15:31.840 --> 15:33.360
asking for some reggae,

15:34.160 --> 15:36.320
you can actually see like the spirit of music

15:36.320 --> 15:37.840
like fly into his mouth

15:37.840 --> 15:39.840
and then it shines bright in his belly.

15:39.840 --> 15:42.880
And then he just like in an ejaculatory scream,

15:42.880 --> 15:44.720
just give us some reggae.

15:49.600 --> 15:52.320
You know when they're working so hard on that album

15:52.320 --> 15:53.760
and it took so long,

15:53.760 --> 15:55.280
I kept telling them,

15:55.280 --> 15:59.680
guys, let's say you have half an album written and done,

15:59.680 --> 16:02.720
just play them half as fast.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.320
Play them like slower

16:04.320 --> 16:06.000
and then you've got a full record, done.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.440
Or just play them again.

16:07.440 --> 16:10.240
But this time like do it with like British accents.

16:10.240 --> 16:12.560
With a bit more reggae.

16:12.560 --> 16:13.680
Here's the lineup.

16:13.680 --> 16:15.440
Track one, Chinese democracy.

16:15.440 --> 16:18.480
Track two, just playing around a Chris Tucker skit.

16:19.120 --> 16:21.840
Track three, Chinese democracy.

16:21.840 --> 16:23.280
Reggae mix.

16:23.280 --> 16:24.000
Reloaded.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.120
Reggaeton mix.

16:25.120 --> 16:26.400
Reloaded with reggae.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.320
Do you guys think we're gonna inevitably end up

16:30.320 --> 16:31.200
like the Gallaghers?

16:32.720 --> 16:34.080
Gallagher one and Gallagher two.

16:34.080 --> 16:37.520
Because I don't know if you follow those bros,

16:37.520 --> 16:40.560
but somebody, one of them retweeted like the other week

16:40.560 --> 16:42.800
like fuck Noel for real.

16:43.440 --> 16:45.680
Fuck this dude, I hate his guts.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.840
It's like you guys made Wonder Ball together,

16:47.840 --> 16:48.480
that's kind of weird.

16:49.360 --> 16:51.760
Oh, he was saying that about his own brother?

16:51.760 --> 16:52.260
Yeah.

16:53.360 --> 16:56.000
And I'm worried like something's gonna happen.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.640
That white beautiful orb of comedy is gonna leave us

16:59.280 --> 17:02.240
and then it's just gonna be like Travis can eat my butthole.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.600
I don't think so, Griffin,

17:05.600 --> 17:08.720
because I don't think the Gallaghers were actual brothers.

17:08.720 --> 17:13.680
Interesting, clones then, huh?

17:13.680 --> 17:16.240
Yeah, or maybe just bound together by a dark secret.

17:17.440 --> 17:19.200
Okay, they killed the third one.

17:19.200 --> 17:20.320
Yeah, something like that.

17:20.320 --> 17:21.920
Okay, yeah, that's possible.

17:23.120 --> 17:24.640
They buried him in an oasis.

17:25.680 --> 17:28.880
Isn't it weird how Noel and Joel Gallagher,

17:28.880 --> 17:31.760
the oasis brothers hate each other?

17:31.760 --> 17:34.560
And then Gallagher one and Gallagher two

17:34.560 --> 17:38.080
are brothers that also have like huge beef.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.400
It's like, that's weird, right?

17:40.400 --> 17:42.240
What is it with Gallagher brothers?

17:42.240 --> 17:43.440
I don't know.

17:43.440 --> 17:44.320
It's really weird.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.240
Who were the second Gallagher brothers?

17:46.240 --> 17:47.920
Gallagher one and Gallagher two.

17:47.920 --> 17:49.040
Gallagher one and Gallagher two?

17:50.800 --> 17:54.080
Yeah, the watermelon-based comedians.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.240
Griffin, you know that this is not a joke

17:56.240 --> 17:58.240
and that there are in fact two Gallaghers, right?

17:59.520 --> 18:02.160
No, this is a joke from the comedy podcast

18:02.160 --> 18:03.360
My Brother and My Brother and Me

18:03.360 --> 18:05.840
that us three are gonna host until we hate each other.

18:05.840 --> 18:09.040
No, this is 1000% real.

18:09.040 --> 18:10.160
There's a new Gallagher.

18:12.160 --> 18:14.400
Gallagher one, okay, I'll pay you the picture.

18:14.400 --> 18:17.920
Gallagher one was seeing huge success smashing things.

18:17.920 --> 18:21.200
His brother, in envy and perhaps wanting

18:21.200 --> 18:23.120
to get his piece of the watermelon pie,

18:24.160 --> 18:26.560
started touring as Gallagher two.

18:26.560 --> 18:32.240
Oh my God, this is like the real life prestige.

18:32.240 --> 18:33.680
This is the prestige two.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.200
How do you know which one you're getting

18:35.200 --> 18:36.960
when he says I love you to you?

18:38.080 --> 18:40.560
How do you even know which fucking Gallagher it is?

18:40.560 --> 18:43.600
Exactly, that was the exact problem.

18:44.880 --> 18:48.480
The only thing that Gallagher asked Gallagher two,

18:49.280 --> 18:51.600
his brother Gallagher, Ron Gallagher,

18:52.320 --> 18:56.320
the only thing he asked him was to please don't do Sledge-O-Matic.

18:58.640 --> 19:00.800
The siren call was too strong.

19:00.800 --> 19:04.560
He got the, he already bought that big hammer.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.840
Oh God, I want that scene in the movie where like,

19:07.840 --> 19:09.280
he's like of course I won't do Sledge-O-Matic,

19:09.280 --> 19:11.520
but it like pans out and you could see the Sledge-O-Matic

19:11.520 --> 19:13.280
leaning against the wall behind the door

19:13.280 --> 19:16.960
and like we know that he's gonna do Sledge-O-Matic.

19:16.960 --> 19:19.760
This is gonna end with one of them getting hanged

19:19.760 --> 19:21.600
and you, but you don't know which one

19:21.600 --> 19:23.040
and right before he does it,

19:23.040 --> 19:25.280
like a watermelon like falls out of his pocket

19:25.280 --> 19:27.040
and rolls down the gallows stairs

19:27.040 --> 19:31.040
and he just goes like, whammo, dead.

19:31.760 --> 19:34.240
The classic, classic Gallagher phrase.

19:34.240 --> 19:39.040
And then the other one fucking kills Batman.

19:40.080 --> 19:42.800
Here's a question, I work at a startup

19:42.800 --> 19:45.360
where one of the perks is a laundry service.

19:45.360 --> 19:46.960
Once a week we can bring in a bag of laundry

19:46.960 --> 19:48.640
for wash and fold, fuck.

19:49.360 --> 19:51.120
I'm going on parental leave soon

19:51.120 --> 19:53.120
and I have lightheartedly announced my intention

19:53.120 --> 19:55.840
to drop by during my leave to drop off,

19:55.840 --> 19:56.960
pick up my laundry.

19:57.520 --> 20:00.640
Here's the problem, everyone keeps acting like I'm joking.

20:00.640 --> 20:06.400
I feel like if I ask outright,

20:06.400 --> 20:08.640
I'm putting them in a position where they can't say no,

20:08.640 --> 20:09.840
even if it's not okay.

20:10.720 --> 20:13.920
Am I taking a work perk too far?

20:13.920 --> 20:15.520
Is there a way to clear this up

20:15.520 --> 20:18.560
without putting someone in an awkward position?

20:18.560 --> 20:20.720
And that's from Laundry Leecher.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.200
My God, there's such an easy way.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.040
What is it, Griff?

20:26.160 --> 20:28.160
Don't do this thing.

20:28.880 --> 20:29.280
Wrong.

20:29.280 --> 20:30.960
I know I'm not technically on the clock,

20:30.960 --> 20:33.280
I'm taking kind of a three year sabbatical

20:33.280 --> 20:34.800
to kind of find myself.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.480
Anyway, here's my dirty jeans.

20:38.400 --> 20:38.900
Unless.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.840
Oh, this is gonna be a tricky needle

20:41.840 --> 20:44.240
and a tricky unless needle to thread, Travis,

20:44.240 --> 20:45.280
but unless.

20:46.080 --> 20:49.120
Here's the thing, is this perk a replacement

20:49.120 --> 20:51.520
for like a normal benefit or pay?

20:51.520 --> 20:52.880
I'm so funny.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.000
No, hear me out.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.720
If the startup was like, listen, we're new,

20:56.720 --> 20:59.200
we can't afford to pay you guys the salary

20:59.200 --> 21:00.800
that a bigger company would,

21:00.800 --> 21:05.120
but we have connections with this wash and fold place.

21:05.120 --> 21:08.000
We got a deal through there so we can kind of balance out.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.640
It's a cool hip perk of working with us, right?

21:10.640 --> 21:13.280
So if that was guaranteed like once a week,

21:13.280 --> 21:14.400
this is part of your thing

21:14.400 --> 21:18.560
and you're taking paid leave, I think it's included.

21:19.120 --> 21:21.440
I think it's a pretty shitty perk.

21:21.440 --> 21:25.840
If you can't use it when you're on parental leave

21:25.840 --> 21:27.600
and need it more than you've ever needed it

21:27.600 --> 21:28.800
in your entire life,

21:29.440 --> 21:32.800
I think that you should definitely do this thing

21:32.800 --> 21:35.920
because you are going to need that very, very badly

21:35.920 --> 21:38.480
and I think that you are well within your rights.

21:38.480 --> 21:41.920
This is a thing nice, like good people worry about

21:41.920 --> 21:44.160
that like normal people don't.

21:44.160 --> 21:45.840
Normal people would just roll up and like,

21:45.840 --> 21:47.200
yeah, I just needed to check some mail

21:47.200 --> 21:49.920
and happen to have some laundry with me, here you go.

21:49.920 --> 21:51.680
Like the fact that you're worried about it

21:51.680 --> 21:53.360
means you're probably not that bad a person,

21:53.360 --> 21:55.040
but you should still totally do it.

21:55.040 --> 21:56.800
No pun intended, there is a wrinkle here

21:56.800 --> 21:58.000
that we are not considering.

21:59.120 --> 22:02.880
I can't imagine a scenario where I would want

22:02.880 --> 22:04.800
all of the people that I work with

22:04.800 --> 22:08.800
in my professional day-to-day to see what I do

22:08.800 --> 22:11.680
to all my clothes, do you know what I'm saying?

22:11.680 --> 22:12.560
I don't think you have to walk in

22:12.560 --> 22:16.480
and hold each piece up for them and just drop a bag off.

22:16.480 --> 22:17.840
You walk in with the hamper

22:17.840 --> 22:21.040
and like if you walk too close to somebody's desk

22:21.040 --> 22:22.560
and you got some gym clothes in there,

22:23.200 --> 22:25.680
I wouldn't, that's not, do you know,

22:25.680 --> 22:29.280
I'm embarrassed of my dirty clothes.

22:29.920 --> 22:33.280
You are definitely, if you do use this work perk,

22:33.280 --> 22:35.200
you are definitely gonna be like

22:36.400 --> 22:40.320
the deep web equivalent of a laundry load.

22:40.320 --> 22:42.480
You are going to need like a dark load,

22:42.480 --> 22:45.920
a silk road for your silk clothing

22:45.920 --> 22:48.160
and all other clothing that are just,

22:48.160 --> 22:52.000
the circumstances of which are just a little too dark

22:52.000 --> 22:54.320
to bring to the company laundry service.

22:54.320 --> 22:58.320
You need a Ray Donovan to smuggle your clothes in

22:58.320 --> 23:00.080
and he'll fucking wash them for you.

23:00.720 --> 23:02.080
He won't fold, he doesn't fold,

23:02.080 --> 23:03.920
you'll get him back, there'll be a big wrinkly mess.

23:03.920 --> 23:04.960
He doesn't do bleach

23:04.960 --> 23:06.800
because he's worried about his own clothes.

23:06.800 --> 23:09.120
He's worried about getting bleach on his fancy suits,

23:09.680 --> 23:14.160
which is weird, but yeah, that's just Ray.

23:14.160 --> 23:18.560
Ray, could you, could you bring your clothes in

23:19.280 --> 23:21.920
and kind of covertly distribute them

23:21.920 --> 23:26.560
amongst your coworkers bags of laundry

23:26.560 --> 23:28.320
so no one would know you're doing it?

23:28.320 --> 23:31.440
What is this dystopian workplace

23:31.440 --> 23:33.360
where everybody just has all their stinky,

23:33.360 --> 23:34.720
dirty clothes all over?

23:34.720 --> 23:36.320
Wait, I got it, this is great.

23:37.120 --> 23:40.240
Bring a load of laundry in and say,

23:40.240 --> 23:42.160
hey guys, I just want to stop by and say,

23:42.160 --> 23:44.880
hi, I'm on my way to do my own laundry.

23:44.880 --> 23:47.200
I'm really tired and stuff, but I'm just gonna,

23:47.840 --> 23:48.720
you know, I'm not working,

23:48.720 --> 23:51.520
so I would just feel terrible to use the company service

23:51.520 --> 23:54.800
and then forget, wink, and leave it there.

23:54.800 --> 23:55.760
And what are they gonna do?

23:55.760 --> 23:56.880
Are they gonna call you and say,

23:56.880 --> 23:58.240
come get your dirty laundry?

23:58.240 --> 23:59.680
Are they gonna just like do it?

23:59.680 --> 24:02.400
They'll just do it and you should connect so grateful

24:02.400 --> 24:04.480
every time you do that for the next six weeks or so.

24:04.480 --> 24:06.000
Oh, here's the problem, Justin.

24:06.800 --> 24:07.280
If I'm-

24:07.280 --> 24:08.560
Oh wait, there's a problem with that?

24:08.560 --> 24:09.680
It's really good.

24:09.680 --> 24:11.200
If I'm reading this correctly,

24:11.200 --> 24:14.720
unless they like deliver it to your home,

24:14.720 --> 24:17.120
the problem is not in the dropping off laundry.

24:17.120 --> 24:19.600
I think you can do that without drawing too much attention.

24:19.600 --> 24:22.800
It's the picking back up your clean stuff

24:22.800 --> 24:25.600
that really is gonna make you seem like a monster.

24:26.400 --> 24:30.800
Like I literally came in just to get my clean laundry.

24:30.800 --> 24:32.000
Bye, everybody.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.600
Unless you make a big deal out of it.

24:33.600 --> 24:35.600
Just like bury your face in that hamper

24:35.600 --> 24:39.280
and just go like, oh man, they did a great job this.

24:39.280 --> 24:40.960
Everybody come sniff these.

24:40.960 --> 24:41.760
Wonderful.

24:41.760 --> 24:42.880
Anyway, bye.

24:42.880 --> 24:45.920
This makes the difficulty of caring for an infant

24:45.920 --> 24:47.120
almost bearable.

24:47.120 --> 24:48.160
Bye, everybody.

24:48.160 --> 24:48.960
Bye, everyone.

24:50.400 --> 24:52.560
Is that the shitty part that like you took your leave

24:52.560 --> 24:53.600
to care for your baby

24:53.600 --> 24:56.000
and now you're taking time away from your newborn

24:56.000 --> 24:58.320
to drop off your shitty, dirty clothes?

24:58.320 --> 25:02.160
Well, even if I knew this,

25:03.280 --> 25:05.280
if one, I worked in an office

25:05.920 --> 25:10.160
and two, I just got started at a place like this.

25:10.160 --> 25:13.040
Even if I knew this was a thing,

25:14.960 --> 25:17.120
if you think about like actually trying that

25:17.120 --> 25:18.080
for the first time,

25:18.080 --> 25:20.000
I am fairly certain I would never actually

25:20.000 --> 25:21.280
be able to go through with it

25:21.280 --> 25:24.160
because I don't think I would be able to ask enough questions

25:24.800 --> 25:26.000
to figure out what the,

25:26.000 --> 25:29.200
I would be so terrified of doing it wrong.

25:29.200 --> 25:30.960
Like I would show up with a laundry basket

25:30.960 --> 25:32.160
and everybody laugh at me like,

25:32.160 --> 25:33.760
no, you drop it off at this place

25:33.760 --> 25:36.000
or no, you can't put those clothes in there

25:36.000 --> 25:37.600
or no, you gotta sort your clothes first.

25:37.600 --> 25:40.480
I would probably just be so paranoid

25:40.480 --> 25:43.200
about messing it up that I would end up doing myself.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.360
And that's the McElroy way.

25:46.720 --> 25:48.720
Don't try doing anything

25:48.720 --> 25:51.120
because you'll probably get it wrong.

25:51.120 --> 25:51.920
The first time.

25:51.920 --> 25:52.800
The first time.

25:54.160 --> 25:56.240
So how am I supposed to dip this sushi in?

25:56.240 --> 25:58.400
Ah, fuck it, I'll just never eat sushi then.

25:58.400 --> 25:59.680
Burgers forever.

25:59.680 --> 26:01.040
Burgers, I guess, forever then.

26:01.600 --> 26:06.480
I mean, I feel like I'm on fairly firm ground there

26:06.480 --> 26:10.560
considering that like our dad once like ate the edamame

26:10.560 --> 26:12.400
and ate all the shell

26:12.400 --> 26:14.320
and everyone asked him where the shell in,

26:14.320 --> 26:15.920
something in New York and everybody,

26:15.920 --> 26:19.120
this is a few years ago before edamame was like in vogue,

26:19.120 --> 26:22.240
I guess, and everyone asked him where the shells were

26:22.240 --> 26:24.160
and he laughed because he had eaten them.

26:24.160 --> 26:26.560
So it's like, I don't feel like I'm completely,

26:26.560 --> 26:29.120
I don't feel like my suspicion

26:29.680 --> 26:31.600
that someone of my genetic material

26:31.600 --> 26:34.800
would get many things wrong very badly,

26:34.800 --> 26:36.720
comically wrong the first time I tried them

26:36.720 --> 26:39.520
is like out of, out of pocket.

26:39.520 --> 26:39.920
Yeah.

26:39.920 --> 26:42.000
You know, they added something to the menu

26:42.000 --> 26:43.760
where they actually do cook the shells around it now

26:43.760 --> 26:44.480
at that restaurant

26:44.480 --> 26:45.360
and you're supposed to eat the whole thing

26:45.360 --> 26:46.560
and they call it Edadaddy.

26:48.960 --> 26:49.680
All right.

26:49.680 --> 26:50.880
Do you guys want a yahoo or should we?

26:51.520 --> 26:52.000
Yes.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.360
Let's do a yahoo.

26:53.360 --> 26:53.860
Yeah.

26:54.560 --> 26:58.000
This yahoo was sent in by level 9,000 YajruDruJru

26:58.000 --> 26:58.400
driving board.

26:58.400 --> 26:58.960
Thank you, Drew.

26:58.960 --> 27:02.240
It's by Yajru Answers user Cain who asks,

27:02.240 --> 27:05.520
who else can't stand fake OutKast fans?

27:07.280 --> 27:10.000
The ones that just put Andre 3000 and say,

27:10.000 --> 27:11.120
oh, he's creative.

27:11.120 --> 27:13.280
Have y'all actually listened to OutKast albums?

27:13.280 --> 27:15.760
Andre 3000 is kind of like Kendrick Lamar,

27:15.760 --> 27:17.440
observant and introspective.

27:17.440 --> 27:20.160
He talks a lot about what was wrong with urban America,

27:20.160 --> 27:22.320
intricate rhyming and unique musically.

27:22.880 --> 27:26.800
BS, ATE Aliens is the best OutKast album?

27:28.800 --> 27:29.520
That's accurate.

27:29.520 --> 27:30.160
That's sure.

27:30.160 --> 27:32.800
I mean, I'm more of a speaker box love below fan.

27:32.800 --> 27:34.960
Although it was that really technically an OutKast album

27:34.960 --> 27:36.560
because they were kind of divide and conquer.

27:36.560 --> 27:38.800
That was like an OutKast collaboration at that point.

27:38.800 --> 27:44.000
Anyway, yeah, I mean, they bug me when they don't get

27:44.000 --> 27:45.120
the artistry that go into it,

27:45.120 --> 27:51.440
but I am more annoyed by fake OutKast fans.

27:51.440 --> 27:52.080
Do you get it?

27:52.080 --> 27:52.880
Do you know what I mean?

27:52.880 --> 27:56.240
Yeah, but it just seems like this person is presenting

27:56.240 --> 28:00.560
an argument of like OutKast wasn't just good,

28:00.560 --> 28:03.360
they were really good and expecting to get

28:03.360 --> 28:05.600
some kind of argument back from people.

28:06.160 --> 28:08.080
No, I don't think you understand what I'm saying.

28:08.720 --> 28:15.040
I'm talking about reploid, replicant OutKast fans.

28:15.040 --> 28:18.080
Genetically engineered OutKast fans.

28:18.080 --> 28:23.840
People who are just like, hello, I enjoy Sanconia.

28:23.840 --> 28:27.040
Yeah, I do like Sanconia though.

28:27.040 --> 28:29.440
Well, and that's what makes you real.

28:29.440 --> 28:31.920
But like if I cut your hand open, it's gonna be red.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.520
It's not gonna be blue or something.

28:33.520 --> 28:36.720
Well, I actually bleed OutKast.

28:36.720 --> 28:38.320
Wait, or does that make me real or fake?

28:38.320 --> 28:43.520
Hold on, do you build the fake OutKast fans

28:43.520 --> 28:47.680
so that they know too much about OutKast?

28:47.680 --> 28:49.440
Like, are they like a Stepford wives thing

28:49.440 --> 28:52.560
where it's like it's too perfect and they know too much?

28:52.560 --> 28:56.160
Or is it an imperfect duplicate of an OutKast fan?

28:56.880 --> 28:59.920
Maybe we're talking about fake OutKast fans.

28:59.920 --> 29:02.400
Sorry, let me try the fake OutKast fans.

29:03.840 --> 29:10.800
Okay, so you're saying that when I had my OutKast tribute group.

29:13.200 --> 29:14.800
Or we could also be talking about-

29:14.800 --> 29:15.760
Get OutKast too.

29:16.800 --> 29:18.480
My OutKast tribute group OutKast too,

29:18.480 --> 29:22.400
our fans are the people that this person had an issue with.

29:22.400 --> 29:24.880
It could be a cover band, it could just be again.

29:24.880 --> 29:27.280
Hello, I am Andre 3000.

29:27.920 --> 29:29.840
Hello, my name is big boy.

29:30.640 --> 29:32.400
Sometimes my arm has been back.

29:33.280 --> 29:40.880
What if it's people who are fans of the podcast fake OutKast

29:40.880 --> 29:45.360
that's all about like punk and then it's all about all the like prank shows,

29:45.360 --> 29:49.120
the fake OutKast, the fans of that show, maybe they hate-

29:49.120 --> 29:50.480
Now what shows are they gonna be talking about?

29:50.480 --> 29:53.200
Cause Jamie Kennedy Experience, dead, punked, dead.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.680
Although I hear rumblings of a punk too.

29:57.200 --> 29:59.920
Well, here's the problem with punk too, they can't do Sledge-O-Matic.

30:00.560 --> 30:01.520
Yeah, that's a good point.

30:04.800 --> 30:06.080
Which is a good prank.

30:06.080 --> 30:07.760
I mean, let's be honest, it's a pretty good punk.

30:07.760 --> 30:09.840
Oh, I'm sorry, was that your watermelon?

30:12.160 --> 30:16.640
Maybe they have a problem with OutKast fans

30:16.640 --> 30:21.040
that have been printed on a two-dimensional cardboard stand up.

30:21.040 --> 30:24.080
So when they go to greet them and discuss OutKast

30:24.080 --> 30:28.400
and they outstretch their hand to do the traditional OutKast secret handshake,

30:28.400 --> 30:31.920
they just bump up into flat cardboard and they think,

30:31.920 --> 30:34.400
ah, I've been tricked again by a fake OutKast fan.

30:34.400 --> 30:37.120
Maybe they have problems with the bootleg merchandise

30:37.120 --> 30:42.080
where they want only OutKast branded fans to fan themselves with.

30:42.080 --> 30:47.200
And they're buying like, it's spelled like O-W-T-C-A-S-T.

30:47.200 --> 30:49.520
And they're like, wait, is this really an OutKast fan?

30:49.520 --> 30:51.760
It's like, yeah, yeah, sure, $2.99.

30:51.760 --> 30:54.960
And then they get it home and it falls apart the first time they try to use that.

30:56.880 --> 31:02.800
I saw Reploid OutKast back in like 2004.

31:03.440 --> 31:04.880
Man, they were excellent.

31:06.240 --> 31:07.360
What was your favorite song?

31:08.400 --> 31:09.760
Probably Bombs Over Baghdad.

31:09.760 --> 31:17.200
When they were like, I can move an elephant and silverback orangutans,

31:17.200 --> 31:18.640
you can't stop a train.

31:19.760 --> 31:21.520
And a lot of people didn't like the cadence.

31:21.520 --> 31:25.520
Like, I think the flow might be better in the original B.O.B.

31:26.640 --> 31:28.480
But who wants something don't come in the paper,

31:28.480 --> 31:29.920
it'll be there when I lean there.

31:30.480 --> 31:35.280
I think there's a certain hauntingness to that that I really enjoyed.

31:35.280 --> 31:37.840
Also, at one point Andre 3000 opened up his mouth

31:37.840 --> 31:40.400
and sparks shot into the audience for 15 minutes.

31:41.680 --> 31:43.200
Now that's my design.

31:43.200 --> 31:45.760
That's actually part of the pyrotechnics of the show.

31:45.760 --> 31:49.920
It was the bridge of the song, the power music, electric revive.

31:49.920 --> 31:54.320
Just the two of them were like just barfing sparks and it was amazing.

31:54.320 --> 31:57.680
That's, Griffin, I know that you were painting a goof portrait.

31:57.680 --> 31:59.840
That sounds like it would be so fucking cool.

31:59.840 --> 32:00.880
No, it'd be the best thing ever.

32:02.560 --> 32:04.640
10 years since the last OutKast studio album.

32:04.640 --> 32:04.800
Jesus.

32:04.800 --> 32:05.600
Did you believe that shit?

32:05.600 --> 32:06.880
10 years this summer.

32:06.880 --> 32:09.760
August 22nd, 2006 is Idlewild.

32:09.760 --> 32:14.560
I think Big and Andre are probably like locked in combat with the Reploids.

32:16.080 --> 32:16.960
That's the problem.

32:16.960 --> 32:19.200
They've been trying to eliminate the...

32:20.320 --> 32:20.880
Okay.

32:20.880 --> 32:24.000
The Reploids did Idlewild, the movie.

32:24.000 --> 32:28.320
TV networks out there, they're willing to make me a show about...

32:29.120 --> 32:31.680
It'll be basically like supernatural,

32:31.680 --> 32:36.080
except it'll be the OutKast friends going around

32:36.080 --> 32:40.800
and destroying clones and replicants and fake OutKast.

32:40.800 --> 32:46.240
And just trying to find time to like write a new, like construct a new album.

32:46.800 --> 32:47.920
That'll be like a running gag.

32:47.920 --> 32:49.520
People are like, so how's the new album going?

32:49.520 --> 32:50.480
Are you fucking kidding me?

32:50.480 --> 32:51.360
Are you kidding me, dude?

32:51.360 --> 32:55.600
If we take like one day off, do you know how fucked you all would be?

32:55.600 --> 33:00.640
There would be a scene in this where real Big Boy, real Andre,

33:01.760 --> 33:05.120
they're fighting a Reploid duo and they take out Big Boy,

33:05.120 --> 33:09.600
but then Replicant Andre grabs real Andre and they spin around on the ground

33:09.600 --> 33:12.320
and they stand up and Andre 3000 is like,

33:12.320 --> 33:14.160
all right, Big Boy, we've been through a lot.

33:14.160 --> 33:14.960
You know it's me.

33:14.960 --> 33:16.800
Let's just do some rhymes together.

33:16.800 --> 33:18.720
And then the other one would be like,

33:18.720 --> 33:21.440
no, it is me, Andre 3000.

33:21.440 --> 33:22.400
Look at my hat.

33:23.200 --> 33:24.080
Look at my hat.

33:24.080 --> 33:24.960
You know the truth.

33:24.960 --> 33:28.320
Hey, shake it.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.200
Shake it like a Polaroid.

33:31.200 --> 33:32.880
You are, you have killed me.

33:32.880 --> 33:35.360
Good choice, Big Boy.

33:35.360 --> 33:37.040
The second season is better.

33:37.040 --> 33:40.800
The first season of the show, they do a lot of like martial arts

33:40.800 --> 33:43.040
and every time they attack, they're like, hey, yeah.

33:43.040 --> 33:44.880
And it's like, all right guys, we did it.

33:44.880 --> 33:46.560
Like once or twice would be fine.

33:46.560 --> 33:48.720
You've done it 115 times in season one.

33:48.720 --> 33:49.760
Every episode.

33:49.760 --> 33:50.720
They're swarming us.

33:50.720 --> 33:52.400
We can't stop them, Big Boy.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.440
We have to make the call.

33:54.480 --> 33:56.320
Release the bombs over Baghdad.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.840
Andre like jumps a hundred feet in the air

33:59.840 --> 34:02.800
and then like takes out five Replicant Big Boys.

34:02.800 --> 34:03.520
Up there.

34:03.520 --> 34:05.360
And then he lands on the ground and Big Boy just goes,

34:05.360 --> 34:06.560
I like the way you move.

34:11.440 --> 34:12.880
Let's go to the money zone.

34:24.400 --> 34:28.560
I'm hungry, but that's not a problem for me

34:28.560 --> 34:33.680
because I have a fridge that has just been restocked

34:34.400 --> 34:36.160
full of the freshest ingredients,

34:36.160 --> 34:38.960
some of which I cannot even receive in my area

34:38.960 --> 34:41.600
and recipes on how to turn these perfectly proportioned

34:41.600 --> 34:44.960
ingredients into delicious meals for my family.

34:44.960 --> 34:45.760
And guess what?

34:45.760 --> 34:48.880
All these meals cost less than 10 bucks per meal.

34:48.880 --> 34:49.760
God say the brand name.

34:49.760 --> 34:50.800
Please, God say the brand.

34:51.520 --> 34:53.040
Blue Apron.

34:53.040 --> 34:55.680
Man, you really left me in suspense there.

34:55.680 --> 35:00.320
I dropped you in media revs into that particular advertisement.

35:00.320 --> 35:01.920
I don't know where you guys,

35:01.920 --> 35:03.920
I don't know what loop you guys are on right now.

35:03.920 --> 35:08.800
Last night I made fried chicken with a kale slaw

35:08.800 --> 35:13.680
and sweet potato wedges and hot honey.

35:13.680 --> 35:16.160
That was fucking insanely good.

35:16.160 --> 35:17.120
So, so good.

35:17.120 --> 35:18.720
Blue Apron kicks ass.

35:18.720 --> 35:19.440
We all do it.

35:19.440 --> 35:21.120
Like I don't get it for free.

35:21.120 --> 35:22.320
Like I pay for it.

35:22.320 --> 35:25.040
Like it's not one of those like advertisers are sending us.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.200
Like I pay for it because it's fucking exceptional.

35:27.200 --> 35:27.840
Changed my life.

35:27.840 --> 35:30.720
I know how to cook now because of this thing.

35:30.720 --> 35:31.760
It's so good.

35:34.080 --> 35:36.160
If you want to try it and you really, really should.

35:36.720 --> 35:39.040
Here's just a couple of meals available in June.

35:39.040 --> 35:41.520
Creamy shrimp fettuccine with salted green beans and spinach.

35:41.520 --> 35:42.320
Yes, please.

35:42.320 --> 35:45.440
Sweet chili chicken with Tinkerbell peppers, green beans, jasmine rice.

35:45.440 --> 35:48.400
You know, what's cool is if you have certain things you don't eat,

35:48.400 --> 35:50.080
they can do vegetarian meals.

35:50.080 --> 35:52.400
They can do not fish.

35:52.400 --> 35:57.120
If you're not a fish person, they can, you're crazy, by the way.

35:57.120 --> 35:59.760
They're really talented musicians and great pop songwriters.

35:59.760 --> 36:02.960
No, don't spread that bullshit around.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.320
They are not good at all.

36:05.840 --> 36:06.320
Fuck you.

36:06.320 --> 36:07.120
They got some really good parts.

36:07.120 --> 36:07.920
No, they don't.

36:07.920 --> 36:08.880
You're wrong.

36:08.880 --> 36:09.760
No, you're wrong.

36:11.200 --> 36:13.280
I'm saying like, I prefer the studio stuff.

36:13.280 --> 36:16.320
It does get a little noodley for me on like the live records,

36:16.320 --> 36:18.080
but like they have really, I mean,

36:18.080 --> 36:20.480
Treyus Nation has really solid pop construction

36:20.480 --> 36:23.200
when that's the sort of milieu he's working in.

36:23.920 --> 36:24.880
I think it's dump.

36:25.520 --> 36:28.880
And also like, well, that's a really great fucking attitude.

36:28.880 --> 36:32.640
This is supposed to be a show for people to like feel good about.

36:32.640 --> 36:34.560
And there are, I guarantee there's people who are like,

36:34.560 --> 36:35.600
oh, well, fuck you very much.

36:35.600 --> 36:36.240
I should be clear.

36:36.240 --> 36:38.720
I've heard one fish song in my entire life.

36:38.720 --> 36:42.560
Hey everybody, if you're a fish fan, tweet at Travis right now

36:42.560 --> 36:45.120
and all week about your favorite fish songs

36:45.120 --> 36:47.280
until he's a fucking convert by the end of the week.

36:47.840 --> 36:49.680
Okay, I've only heard one song.

36:49.680 --> 36:50.480
Yeah, let me know.

36:50.480 --> 36:52.000
Let me know what's good.

36:52.960 --> 36:54.720
No, don't let him know.

36:54.720 --> 36:59.200
Open up the fucking whole prison cell block and flood him.

36:59.200 --> 37:00.560
I summon the fish fans.

37:01.360 --> 37:03.280
All of my non-fish fans out there,

37:03.280 --> 37:04.800
I need you guys to do the same thing,

37:04.800 --> 37:06.160
but the Justin and Griffin.

37:06.160 --> 37:09.040
No, but we weren't being dingleberries about fish.

37:09.040 --> 37:10.320
Yeah, Travis, this is punishment.

37:10.320 --> 37:11.520
We haven't earned it.

37:11.520 --> 37:12.560
That's not punishment.

37:12.560 --> 37:14.480
It's having his fucking eyes open.

37:15.920 --> 37:17.920
Check out, oh, and you should read Nathan Raven's book

37:17.920 --> 37:19.920
about fish fans and ICP fans called,

37:19.920 --> 37:21.040
You Don't Know Me But You Don't Like Me.

37:21.040 --> 37:22.880
It's really, really, that'll change your life too.

37:22.880 --> 37:24.320
Anyway, check out this week's menu

37:24.320 --> 37:26.080
and get your first three meals for free

37:26.080 --> 37:28.320
with free shipping by going to blueapron.com

37:28.320 --> 37:30.000

37:30.000 --> 37:32.240
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

37:32.240 --> 37:34.640
Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

37:34.640 --> 37:36.480
Can I talk to you about Sheetz?

37:36.480 --> 37:37.360
Please do.

37:37.360 --> 37:40.000
Justin, Justin, do you know anything about Sheetz?

37:40.560 --> 37:44.640
Yeah, it's a sort of a restaurant gas station hybrid

37:44.640 --> 37:48.400
in I guess the Midwest and Northeast.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.000
Northeast may have been more Wawa, I guess,

37:50.000 --> 37:51.840
but yeah, that's Sheetz.

37:51.840 --> 37:55.040
Did you know it can also be a thing that you put on a bed?

37:55.040 --> 37:55.760
True story.

37:56.560 --> 37:57.280
Tell me more.

37:57.280 --> 37:58.320
Well, here's the thing.

37:58.320 --> 38:00.320
If you just slept on your regular bed

38:00.320 --> 38:01.760
without anything on it,

38:01.760 --> 38:05.280
you get your nasty body stuff all over the bed.

38:05.280 --> 38:06.080
And then what are you gonna do?

38:06.080 --> 38:07.440
Buy a new mattress every time?

38:07.440 --> 38:09.440
No, I'm starting at square one here

38:09.440 --> 38:12.160
to explain that Bowling Branch is an amazing company.

38:12.160 --> 38:16.480
So what you do is you put a thin layer of fabric

38:16.480 --> 38:18.640
over your bed that could be washed and replaced

38:18.640 --> 38:20.640
so that you don't have to get a new bed

38:20.640 --> 38:24.320
every time like you drool or sweat or whatever.

38:24.320 --> 38:28.400
And so Bowling Branch is the next evolution of Sheetz.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.000
They don't care about thread count.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.480
They care about quality material.

38:32.480 --> 38:33.680
Thread count is a myth.

38:34.320 --> 38:35.600
Dry land is not a myth.

38:36.400 --> 38:38.480
Neither is quality sheets from Bowling Branch.

38:38.480 --> 38:42.160
They use high quality cotton to make you great sheets.

38:42.160 --> 38:44.160
And because they don't have overhead

38:44.160 --> 38:45.840
like some of the big stores,

38:45.840 --> 38:47.600
they're able to keep their prices down

38:47.600 --> 38:51.440
and get you amazing product at a very reasonable price.

38:51.440 --> 38:54.400
So you can check it out online at BowlingBranch.com.

38:54.400 --> 38:57.600
It's B-O-L-L and Branch.com.

38:58.160 --> 39:00.880
They'll let you try the sheets for 30 nights risk-free.

39:01.680 --> 39:02.720
And it's not just sheets.

39:02.720 --> 39:04.720
I keep saying sheets, but it's towels, blankets,

39:04.720 --> 39:06.400
duvet covers, everything.

39:17.040 --> 39:18.800

39:18.800 --> 39:20.320
Sleep on a dream.

39:20.320 --> 39:22.960
That's not their thing, but it is now.

39:22.960 --> 39:24.400
It's pretty good.

39:24.400 --> 39:27.520
I got a message, your personal message for Robert.

39:27.520 --> 39:31.040
And it's from Laura or Laura or Lara who says,

39:31.680 --> 39:33.920
happy 420, darling Robert.

39:33.920 --> 39:36.560
My dearest Robert, it is time to blaze.

39:36.560 --> 39:41.200
We march for the front lines tomorrow, General Lee says.

39:41.200 --> 39:43.200
I shall await your correspondence.

39:43.200 --> 39:46.800
Please roll this letter up and smoke a fat Dubinsky with it.

39:48.800 --> 39:51.120
Chief my love correspondence, Robert.

39:51.120 --> 39:53.760
Chief it up right.

39:53.760 --> 39:56.880
Roll it only the way we used to roll it.

39:56.880 --> 39:59.680
My dankest love, Laura.

39:59.680 --> 40:02.720
Happy 420, darling Robert.

40:02.720 --> 40:05.680
Happy 420, darling Robert.

40:05.680 --> 40:08.560
The first four years have been rough, I can't lie.

40:08.560 --> 40:11.040
But here's to the next 20 being smooth sailing.

40:11.040 --> 40:12.880
I'm sorry this message is late.

40:12.880 --> 40:17.200
There's so much to love in these like four sentences

40:17.200 --> 40:19.440
or three sentences, holy shit.

40:20.320 --> 40:22.720
First of all, you're basically saying 24 years

40:22.720 --> 40:24.480
and then that's it, which is great.

40:25.200 --> 40:26.720
You wish them a happy 420,

40:26.720 --> 40:29.760
which is like really specific timing.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.440
I'm hoping you managed to like work it out

40:31.440 --> 40:33.680
so that this message was played directly at 420.

40:33.680 --> 40:34.960
Chief it up, blaze it.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.880
And then you apologize for the message being late.

40:37.600 --> 40:40.400
Which honestly all Jumbotron messages should conclude with.

40:41.680 --> 40:45.600
It should be like the sorry so sloppy of Jumbotron messages.

40:48.080 --> 40:50.960
Great message, let's see if this next one can compete.

40:50.960 --> 40:55.360
It's for everyone and it's from Sparkles.

40:55.360 --> 40:59.040
And the message is be cool like Blair.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.760
And the preferred timeframe for this message is

41:01.760 --> 41:03.600
whenever I love and trust you.

41:05.120 --> 41:07.520
Yes, this is another very good Jumbotron message.

41:07.520 --> 41:10.080
You'll know the right moment.

41:10.080 --> 41:11.600
Which Blair are we talking about?

41:13.680 --> 41:15.840
Blair Walder from Gossip Girl maybe?

41:15.840 --> 41:16.800
That's probably it.

41:16.800 --> 41:18.960
No, I think this is probably a real Blair

41:18.960 --> 41:22.000
that a person named Sparkles, maybe that's a pseudonym,

41:23.280 --> 41:26.800
just wants everyone to know their friend Blair is really cool.

41:26.800 --> 41:28.640
And I don't know anything about Blair.

41:28.640 --> 41:30.400
I mean, except for the fact that it's a cool name.

41:30.400 --> 41:32.960
So I'll aspire to be at least as cool as the name is.

41:33.840 --> 41:35.920
Do you know there's a WikiHow article

41:35.920 --> 41:38.400
called how to behave like Blair Waldorf

41:38.400 --> 41:39.920
and it has eight steps to it?

41:39.920 --> 41:43.760
Like WikiHow, I think you don't fall outside the lines.

41:43.760 --> 41:46.000
I don't think that that's what your service

41:46.000 --> 41:47.680
is supposed to be used for.

41:47.680 --> 41:50.800
I think you're probably getting a bit big for your breaches.

41:50.800 --> 41:55.120
You know at the moment of Yahoo Answers passing

41:56.080 --> 41:57.360
there will be a quickening.

41:57.360 --> 42:01.920
Right, when somebody, when Marissa Mayer

42:03.360 --> 42:05.040
fucking beheads Yahoo Answers,

42:05.600 --> 42:06.800
which is the only way to kill it,

42:07.360 --> 42:09.040
there will be a quickening

42:09.040 --> 42:12.240
and WikiHow will receive the quickening.

42:14.640 --> 42:15.920
If there's gotta be a bidding war,

42:15.920 --> 42:18.400
if there's a bidding war for like the Yahoo.

42:18.400 --> 42:19.200
I will kickstart it.

42:19.840 --> 42:23.040
This will be the thing we use our one token

42:23.040 --> 42:27.280
of like Kickstarter support from listeners.

42:27.280 --> 42:29.280
We'll go to Roman Mars and we'll pick up our token

42:29.920 --> 42:31.920
so we can put it into the machine

42:31.920 --> 42:33.680
to get something crowdfunded.

42:33.680 --> 42:34.180
Yes.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.240
So everyone be cool like Blair, I guess.

42:38.240 --> 42:38.740
Yeah.

42:39.360 --> 42:40.400
Hey, James.

42:40.400 --> 42:41.440
Hey, Nick.

42:41.440 --> 42:42.800
Where are we right now?

42:42.800 --> 42:44.160
You're in the minority corner.

42:44.160 --> 42:45.600
Haven't you been here before?

42:45.600 --> 42:46.160
You know what?

42:46.160 --> 42:47.200
I think I have.

42:47.200 --> 42:48.560
Cause you're a woman.

42:48.560 --> 42:50.000
And you're a gay man.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.360
And we're both black.

42:53.360 --> 42:54.960
And now that we're here in the minority corner,

42:54.960 --> 42:56.160
what should we talk about?

42:56.160 --> 42:59.360
How about race, gender, and sexuality?

42:59.360 --> 43:01.440
Ooh, and we can gossip about celebrities

43:01.440 --> 43:03.120
and I can quiz you on pop culture.

43:03.120 --> 43:04.720
Ooh, and we can have guests.

43:04.720 --> 43:07.280
We're gonna learn, laugh, and play.

43:07.280 --> 43:09.920
You know, that sounds a lot like Blue's Clues.

43:09.920 --> 43:12.480
Only it's more black, gay.

43:13.040 --> 43:14.400
And ladylike.

43:14.400 --> 43:15.920
Minority corner with a K.

43:15.920 --> 43:17.040
Check us out.

43:17.040 --> 43:20.800
Cause the C was taken.

43:20.800 --> 43:21.600
Hey, read a question.

43:22.160 --> 43:25.120
My landlord recently had a fence erected around my house,

43:25.120 --> 43:26.960
including a gate that stands between my front door

43:26.960 --> 43:28.080
and the sidewalk.

43:28.080 --> 43:30.080
He lives on the block and really seems to enjoy

43:30.080 --> 43:32.560
making eye contact while walking up to my house

43:32.560 --> 43:34.960
and closing the gate every time I failed to do so.

43:34.960 --> 43:38.080
Oh, I've never spoke to the guy.

43:38.080 --> 43:40.560
So it feels like a pretty weird power play to me.

43:40.560 --> 43:42.480
Should I just hold my breath till I move away

43:42.480 --> 43:43.920
or is it time to escalate?

43:44.960 --> 43:45.520
So wait.

43:45.520 --> 43:47.280
It's open in Iowa City.

43:47.280 --> 43:49.360
Is this a situation where the landlord also lives

43:49.360 --> 43:50.560
in this building?

43:50.560 --> 43:51.760
It doesn't sound like it.

43:51.760 --> 43:52.160
No.

43:52.160 --> 43:53.040
Oh, he lives on the block.

43:53.040 --> 43:55.360
So he like literally walks down to your street,

43:55.360 --> 43:57.280
makes eye contact, shuts the gate.

43:57.280 --> 43:59.760
Why the fuck do you care if the gate is shut or not?

44:01.360 --> 44:03.520
I mean, I get, okay, well, let me ask you this, Griffin.

44:04.160 --> 44:07.920
If you paid money to put a gate up and the gate was open,

44:07.920 --> 44:09.760
wouldn't you think, well, why the fuck did I do that?

44:09.760 --> 44:11.200
Right, but a gate, like it sounds like anybody

44:11.200 --> 44:12.080
can just open the gate.

44:12.080 --> 44:13.760
What are you protecting it from, cougars?

44:13.760 --> 44:16.560
Are you the only person who lives in the house?

44:20.000 --> 44:21.120
This is very odd.

44:21.120 --> 44:22.480
This is very strange.

44:24.240 --> 44:25.680
Wait, wait, wait.

44:26.240 --> 44:29.120
Do you think that when the landlord is closing the gate,

44:29.120 --> 44:31.280
he's thinking, I don't want you to get out.

44:33.280 --> 44:34.480
I don't know how gates work.

44:34.480 --> 44:36.720
I need to keep you safe, my precious tenant.

44:39.920 --> 44:42.080
It's a really weird power play in that

44:42.080 --> 44:44.000
it doesn't assert any power.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.520
It's just a weird thing to do.

44:46.800 --> 44:47.920
He's not looking out for you

44:47.920 --> 44:50.480
unless you do literally live in cougar town.

44:51.360 --> 44:53.840
Although I think even a lot of cougars

44:53.840 --> 44:54.960
could probably figure out a way.

44:55.680 --> 44:57.360
I mean, they could just World War Z it

44:57.360 --> 45:00.480
and run at the gate until they form a cougar based stairwell.

45:01.200 --> 45:02.240
You know what I mean?

45:02.240 --> 45:05.520
But like, this is the weird thing about living in proximity

45:06.160 --> 45:08.720
to people who like own a thing is

45:08.720 --> 45:11.040
people get really weird hangups.

45:11.040 --> 45:14.320
Like I used to get weird notes on this one place I lived at

45:14.320 --> 45:19.840
where the woman who was sort of like living in the building

45:19.840 --> 45:20.800
in a discounted rate

45:20.800 --> 45:22.960
because she was sort of keeping an eye on it

45:22.960 --> 45:25.040
and so would get like very overzealous.

45:25.040 --> 45:26.560
So I'd get these weird notes like,

45:28.480 --> 45:32.720
when you bring your Christmas tree back downstairs,

45:32.720 --> 45:34.560
please make sure to shake all the dead needles off

45:34.560 --> 45:35.120
before you do it.

45:35.120 --> 45:37.360
And she would put it up there in like August

45:37.360 --> 45:39.760
to like really make sure that we were thinking about it

45:39.760 --> 45:40.640
for a very long time

45:40.640 --> 45:41.680
or she put notes like,

45:41.680 --> 45:44.720
please stop stealing all my laundry soap

45:44.720 --> 45:45.680
and please buy your own.

45:45.680 --> 45:46.560
You know, weird stuff.

45:46.560 --> 45:47.680
Weird hangups like that.

45:50.560 --> 45:52.320
When I lived in the West Virginia building

45:53.200 --> 45:54.080
and I was, you know,

45:55.360 --> 45:57.840
I don't wanna dad turn off the podcast

45:57.840 --> 46:01.600
but I was, you know, hitting that Skywalker OG.

46:01.600 --> 46:02.240
You know what I mean?

46:02.240 --> 46:03.280
I don't.

46:03.280 --> 46:04.720
Having some of that purple Urkel.

46:04.720 --> 46:06.000
You know what I'm talking about?

46:06.000 --> 46:06.400
I don't.

46:06.400 --> 46:11.840
So I did not realize until the day that we all moved out

46:11.840 --> 46:16.160
that our landlord literally lived a floor directly above us.

46:17.120 --> 46:18.000
Oh my.

46:18.000 --> 46:21.520
And they must have been like super chill about it

46:22.240 --> 46:24.080
because we never received a knock on the door.

46:24.880 --> 46:27.120
That is so much worse of a thing to do

46:27.120 --> 46:29.040
than leaving your gate open.

46:29.040 --> 46:30.560
Unless again, you do live in Cougar Town.

46:31.840 --> 46:33.360
Why are landlords,

46:33.360 --> 46:35.200
why are some landlords horrible

46:35.200 --> 46:39.280
and some just love it when you party?

46:39.280 --> 46:43.120
I had a landlord who was a very nice woman

46:44.400 --> 46:45.680
and we lived in this apartment

46:45.680 --> 46:47.520
for like five years in Cincinnati

46:47.520 --> 46:49.280
who would routinely come over

46:49.280 --> 46:50.560
just to like check in

46:50.560 --> 46:52.720
and seemingly just to judge

46:52.720 --> 46:55.520
where we would put our furniture in the house.

46:56.160 --> 46:57.360
That's not how I do it.

46:57.360 --> 47:01.040
Yeah, or like how we were caring for like our backyard

47:01.600 --> 47:04.720
or what kind of deck chairs we had.

47:04.720 --> 47:09.760
She was very judgmental in like a familial way.

47:09.760 --> 47:10.800
Not like in a mean way,

47:10.800 --> 47:14.560
but like you would expect your mom to check up on you.

47:14.560 --> 47:15.920
It was very weird.

47:15.920 --> 47:18.320
And I always wanted to just look at her and be like,

47:18.320 --> 47:19.520
hey, I appreciate you.

47:19.520 --> 47:21.120
And like, I give you money.

47:21.120 --> 47:22.400
Please don't come over.

47:24.400 --> 47:25.760
Please don't where you are.

47:25.760 --> 47:27.600
Here's a weird part about this question to me

47:27.600 --> 47:28.800
is that when they say that

47:29.600 --> 47:31.680
he really seems to enjoy making eye contact

47:31.680 --> 47:32.880
while walking up to my house

47:32.880 --> 47:35.200
and closing the gate every time I feel to do so.

47:35.200 --> 47:37.600
That's weird that they're doing that.

47:37.600 --> 47:39.840
But like, what are you doing

47:40.640 --> 47:42.240
that you are in a position

47:42.880 --> 47:45.360
to make eye contact with the landlord

47:45.360 --> 47:47.600
when they walk up your side?

47:47.600 --> 47:49.840
Like, are you just like leaving the gate open

47:49.840 --> 47:51.840
and then standing outside in your truth

47:51.840 --> 47:53.840
and just waiting for them to come by

47:53.840 --> 47:54.800
so you can make eye contact with them?

47:54.800 --> 47:56.240
Another possibility.

47:56.240 --> 47:56.960
That's possible.

47:59.520 --> 48:00.640
I guess this is just an endorsement.

48:00.640 --> 48:01.440
If you live in Huntington,

48:01.440 --> 48:03.120
looking for a place to live, West Virginia is great.

48:03.120 --> 48:04.240
West Virginia building is great.

48:04.960 --> 48:06.880
They are just like, they're down with whatever.

48:06.880 --> 48:08.560
Landlord will just like walk in and be like,

48:08.560 --> 48:10.320
it smells like that good good in here.

48:10.320 --> 48:11.280
Anyway, have fun, boys.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.440
And Rio Grande is like right downstairs.

48:13.440 --> 48:15.040
Rio Grande is right downstairs,

48:15.040 --> 48:17.200
which is like conducive to the good good.

48:17.200 --> 48:19.920
And I think backyard is like right across the street, right?

48:19.920 --> 48:20.960
Oh, yeah.

48:20.960 --> 48:22.480
Yeah, and you got a,

48:22.480 --> 48:23.600
there's a frozen yogurt,

48:23.600 --> 48:25.440
tropical moon place right across the street.

48:25.440 --> 48:27.360
Walking distance to the movie theater.

48:27.360 --> 48:29.360
Yeah, there's two derelict movie theaters

48:29.360 --> 48:31.200
that you can just go walk and throw rocks at.

48:31.200 --> 48:31.840
It's awesome.

48:33.120 --> 48:34.400
Things about she's co-creator,

48:34.400 --> 48:35.360
Dwight Slappy lives there.

48:35.360 --> 48:36.320
You can go hang out with him.

48:36.320 --> 48:37.840
It's got a lot going for it.

48:37.840 --> 48:39.120
It's got so much going for it.

48:39.120 --> 48:40.800
So how about a Yahoo?

48:40.800 --> 48:41.600
I'd love that, Griffin.

48:41.600 --> 48:43.040
This one is sent in by Aaron Keys.

48:43.040 --> 48:43.600
Thank you, Aaron.

48:43.600 --> 48:48.960
It's by Yahoo Answers user Usman, who asks,

48:50.080 --> 48:51.840
teaching internet, my uncle.

48:54.080 --> 48:54.880
Hello, all.

48:54.880 --> 48:56.640
Well, first, my English is not good,

48:56.640 --> 48:58.000
but hope you can understand.

48:58.000 --> 48:58.880
That's fine.

48:58.880 --> 48:59.360
We'll get it.

48:59.360 --> 49:02.960
Okay, my uncle wants to learn internet from me.

49:02.960 --> 49:05.280
I'm using the internet since 2010,

49:05.280 --> 49:08.720
and I have much knowledge about internet downloading

49:08.720 --> 49:10.400
and searching, almost everything.

49:10.400 --> 49:11.760
But I'm confused.

49:11.760 --> 49:13.840
How can I teach him internet?

49:13.840 --> 49:18.480
So I need your suggestion from where should I need to start?

49:18.480 --> 49:19.840
How can I teach him internet?

49:19.840 --> 49:20.400
Thanks.

49:21.120 --> 49:22.800
I don't want to make it sound like we're laughing

49:22.800 --> 49:26.080
at this person's message,

49:26.080 --> 49:30.160
or the syntax of the message.

49:30.720 --> 49:32.640
No, I guarantee that sounds better

49:32.640 --> 49:35.280
than if I tried to write a message and say Spanish.

49:35.280 --> 49:35.920
Yes, sure.

49:37.840 --> 49:39.040
I'm laughing about like,

49:39.040 --> 49:43.280
how do you really sit an old man down?

49:43.280 --> 49:46.560
How do you sit your old uncle down and start?

49:47.280 --> 49:50.000
Where do you start with the internet?

49:50.000 --> 49:52.320
You have a clean slate experience

49:52.320 --> 49:54.000
where the first thing you show them

49:54.000 --> 49:57.600
will be the jumping off point for internet for them.

49:57.600 --> 49:59.520
Because it's going to be like you sit them down

49:59.520 --> 50:00.160
and they're like,

50:00.160 --> 50:02.960
where do I put in the internet floppy disk?

50:02.960 --> 50:04.640
And it's like, oh, Jesus.

50:04.640 --> 50:05.120
Oh, my God.

50:05.120 --> 50:07.920
I saved all my punch cards.

50:07.920 --> 50:09.920
So we're literally at ground zero.

50:09.920 --> 50:10.420
Okay.

50:14.480 --> 50:16.080
How do you teach someone the internet?

50:16.800 --> 50:20.400
Now, how do I save the internet when I'm done with it?

50:20.400 --> 50:21.760
No, oh, Jesus.

50:21.760 --> 50:23.920
But think of the power you have with like,

50:23.920 --> 50:26.160
you have this lump of clay in front of you

50:26.160 --> 50:28.560
and you can mold in their mind

50:28.560 --> 50:30.720
their concept of the internet.

50:30.720 --> 50:34.480
You could just take them to like three pictures of a cat

50:34.480 --> 50:36.640
and a recipe for fried chicken

50:36.640 --> 50:39.360
and say, and that's the internet.

50:39.360 --> 50:39.840
That's it.

50:39.840 --> 50:42.960
That's what all the fuss has been about.

50:42.960 --> 50:44.160
That's all there is so far.

50:44.160 --> 50:46.640
We're still waiting for people to put some more on there.

50:46.640 --> 50:49.440
But so far, we're pretty happy with the start of it.

50:49.440 --> 50:52.400
Anyways, no need for you to ever get on this again.

50:53.440 --> 50:54.720
I imagine on the first day,

50:54.720 --> 50:57.600
your pawpaw sits down at the computer

50:57.600 --> 50:59.040
and you just laugh like, ha!

50:59.040 --> 51:00.400
Yeah, you think you're ready for that?

51:01.040 --> 51:02.240
No, no, stand up.

51:02.240 --> 51:05.120
And then you throw a notepad and a pen and start there.

51:05.120 --> 51:07.280
Start putting searches into that first

51:07.280 --> 51:10.320
and then you'll be ready to ride the snake at some point.

51:10.320 --> 51:10.800
Not now.

51:10.800 --> 51:15.920
Yeah, I enjoy, actually, I'm coming back from a different place

51:15.920 --> 51:17.360
because there is, we're laughing at this,

51:17.360 --> 51:21.040
but there's certain knowledge that we possess about the internet

51:21.040 --> 51:23.920
that goes beyond like, how do I find information?

51:23.920 --> 51:25.040
How do I Google?

51:25.040 --> 51:26.000
What is an email?

51:26.000 --> 51:26.720
How do I say?

51:26.720 --> 51:29.760
There's stuff that you need to know about sort of the landscape.

51:29.760 --> 51:34.240
And I think really the only way to educate an old, old man about all that

51:34.240 --> 51:38.080
is to just throw them into that deep Tumblr,

51:38.080 --> 51:40.160
into a deep old Tumblr

51:40.160 --> 51:42.800
and let them kind of dig their way out from there.

51:42.800 --> 51:45.680
I'm talking about literally restraining them to a chair

51:45.680 --> 51:49.280
and say like, you can only stand up and leave this room and use the potty

51:49.280 --> 51:52.080
once you've found your way out of this like,

51:52.880 --> 51:59.040
SpongeBob SquarePants rule 34 Tumblr collection.

51:59.040 --> 52:00.080
Have fun, grandpa.

52:00.080 --> 52:02.880
Thanks for fighting in the Korean War for me,

52:02.880 --> 52:05.920
but you need to get the hell out of escape from Tumblr, I call it.

52:07.840 --> 52:10.560
That's a good way to get that going, I think.

52:10.560 --> 52:15.920
You heroically piloted a helicopter to evacuate Vietnam War vets

52:15.920 --> 52:17.120
and that was a great thing you did.

52:17.120 --> 52:20.480
Now it's time to see if you can escape from a different place,

52:20.480 --> 52:22.880
which is to say that deep Tumblr.

52:23.920 --> 52:24.480
Wait, hold on.

52:25.520 --> 52:31.040
I really enjoy that you piloted a helicopter to evacuate Vietnam War vets.

52:31.040 --> 52:33.120
Like someone's fighting in the Vietnam War,

52:33.120 --> 52:34.960
they're like, help, stop, I'm a veteran.

52:34.960 --> 52:35.920
Like, yeah, I know.

52:35.920 --> 52:38.480
That's what they did back in the Vietnam War.

52:38.480 --> 52:40.880
Okay, you know what I'm saying.

52:40.880 --> 52:44.000
And to be fair, he didn't say evacuated Vietnam War vets from Vietnam.

52:44.000 --> 52:44.240
Yeah.

52:44.240 --> 52:45.520
Could have been somewhere else.

52:45.520 --> 52:48.400
Could have been a building full of Vietnam War vets that caught on fire.

52:48.400 --> 52:51.840
I also didn't say in 2008.

52:55.360 --> 52:55.760
I think that's a good way to-

52:55.760 --> 52:58.960
You evacuated all those Vietnam War vets even as they asked you to stop

52:58.960 --> 53:00.560
because they were just in their houses.

53:00.560 --> 53:02.080
Please, I'm fine here.

53:02.080 --> 53:02.480
What if-

53:02.480 --> 53:03.040
Thank you.

53:03.040 --> 53:13.520
What if my thing though, they're at like an AARP party or whatever

53:13.520 --> 53:16.720
and they're talking to their cohorts and their cohorts is like,

53:16.720 --> 53:21.120
my grandson got me a Blackberry and I've been using it to be on the internet.

53:21.120 --> 53:23.520
And then this Tumblr grandpa would just be like,

53:23.520 --> 53:31.360
oh, let me show you this high res JPEG that I found of Patrick the starfish is hard cock.

53:31.360 --> 53:34.000
And everyone's like, what are you doing?

53:34.000 --> 53:36.080
And he's like, no, this is internet.

53:36.080 --> 53:36.800
My grandson-

53:36.800 --> 53:37.600
This is all it is.

53:37.600 --> 53:43.520
My grandson locked me in a shower, an unused basement shower

53:43.520 --> 53:47.360
and wouldn't let me leave until I sort of discovered what internet was.

53:47.360 --> 53:48.800
And this is it, it's the starfish is hard cock.

53:48.800 --> 53:49.600
And I'm better for it.

53:49.600 --> 53:51.280
Yeah, I know a lot of stuff now.

53:51.280 --> 53:56.720
Can you imagine being like 86 and your grandson's showing you the weirdest shit

53:56.720 --> 54:01.120
he can find on the internet and you stumble across what happens to you

54:01.120 --> 54:03.520
what has always been your thing.

54:03.520 --> 54:08.480
And you didn't know about it till you were 86 and you found it on like Reddit

54:08.480 --> 54:12.480
and you're like, oh, I've wasted so much time.

54:12.480 --> 54:14.720
On your deathbed, just like flipping through the Blackberry,

54:14.720 --> 54:17.920
your grandson just got you and you end up on that deep Tumblr

54:17.920 --> 54:19.840
and it's like, here's my Tumblr blog.

54:19.840 --> 54:22.800
And it's all just the art of Squidward and he's got six dicks.

54:22.800 --> 54:24.320
And you're like, that's it.

54:26.640 --> 54:27.760
That's my gem.

54:27.760 --> 54:33.040
That's my fetish I found.

54:33.040 --> 54:37.360
I found, fly me to heaven, Squidward's six cocks.

54:39.120 --> 54:40.160
You're squiggins.

54:42.400 --> 54:50.000
Using this new technology, the only way we can solve this murder

54:50.000 --> 54:53.600
is to use your grandpa as a spirit medium.

54:53.600 --> 54:56.880
Using this crystal orb, we'll be able to see the last thing

54:56.880 --> 54:59.200
he saw with his eyes before his...

54:59.200 --> 55:03.040
Oh my God, is this Squidward from the cartoon SpongeBob SquarePants?

55:04.240 --> 55:05.120
Does he have six?

55:05.120 --> 55:06.960
Does he have six hard cocks?

55:08.160 --> 55:10.800
Can I get a count on these hard cocks?

55:11.360 --> 55:12.960
One, two, three, four, five.

55:12.960 --> 55:13.680
Oh, there's another.

55:13.680 --> 55:14.400
Yeah, six.

55:14.400 --> 55:14.900
What?

55:16.080 --> 55:18.000
Oh no, now this is my thing too.

55:18.720 --> 55:20.320
Oh no, it's like the ring.

55:20.320 --> 55:21.040
It's like the ring.

55:21.040 --> 55:22.000
Oh, Jesus.

55:22.000 --> 55:27.200
It's Squidward's climbing out of the ball.

55:27.200 --> 55:28.800
You know, there are six of you.

55:28.800 --> 55:29.840
Oh God, no.

55:31.440 --> 55:35.040
But you can't, if you're the one who did it though,

55:35.040 --> 55:37.920
you cannot let your family discover what you have done.

55:37.920 --> 55:38.240
Oh no.

55:38.240 --> 55:40.800
So it's gonna be very awkward when your grandpa dies

55:40.800 --> 55:43.040
and the first thing you do is grab his phone

55:43.040 --> 55:44.080
and throw it in the toilet.

55:45.920 --> 55:48.080
Listen, this is all very sad,

55:48.080 --> 55:50.880
but right now I need to throw grandpa's phone in the toilet.

55:50.880 --> 55:54.240
It's like, this goes beyond a history purge.

55:54.240 --> 55:57.520
If there's a chance that a single one of these bits or bytes

55:57.520 --> 55:58.960
remains in the cookie cache.

55:59.920 --> 56:01.520
Did anyone teach you about the cloud?

56:01.520 --> 56:02.800
Please, you have to tell me.

56:02.800 --> 56:04.400
Did anyone teach you about the cloud?

56:04.960 --> 56:08.320
Your grandpa, like he requested,

56:08.320 --> 56:11.360
will now have his ashes scattered at sea.

56:11.360 --> 56:13.680
I'm just gonna chuck his blackberry in there too,

56:13.680 --> 56:14.960
just so he's-

56:14.960 --> 56:15.840
Just to be safe.

56:15.840 --> 56:19.920
Just to be safe, so he can have it in Davy Jones' locker.

56:19.920 --> 56:24.160
Hey, Stevie, I found all these printed off things

56:24.160 --> 56:25.680
in your grandfather's room.

56:25.680 --> 56:27.520
He printed stuff off.

56:27.520 --> 56:28.480
Damn it, old man.

56:29.280 --> 56:29.680
Damn it.

56:30.640 --> 56:32.000
One step ahead of me.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.880
I know he just died, but I don't think I love him anymore.

56:37.120 --> 56:40.240
He flew helicopters in NOM for you, I think.

56:40.240 --> 56:40.960
For somebody.

56:42.400 --> 56:46.240
But look at all these pictures of Squidward's rock hard six days.

56:47.440 --> 56:48.880
That's my dad.

56:48.880 --> 56:50.240
That's my dad did that.

56:50.240 --> 56:51.120
It was my dad.

56:51.120 --> 56:52.560
I don't have a dad anymore.

56:52.560 --> 56:53.120
That's weird.

56:53.120 --> 56:55.120
He's dead to me in so many ways now.

56:56.720 --> 56:58.000
Yeah, I just kind of appeared.

56:58.720 --> 57:01.120
I just kind of like showed up one day as a baby.

57:01.120 --> 57:02.880
No dad, no dad involved.

57:02.880 --> 57:03.520
No dad at all.

57:03.520 --> 57:04.400
That's crazy.

57:04.400 --> 57:05.200
I don't have a dad.

57:07.200 --> 57:08.560
That's gonna do it for us.

57:08.560 --> 57:10.000
Was that too provocative?

57:10.000 --> 57:14.320
I get tweets pretty regularly from people who are like,

57:14.320 --> 57:16.800
I was on the bus and my headphones came on jacked

57:16.800 --> 57:18.960
and then Griffin yelled something about Squidward

57:18.960 --> 57:23.200
from SpongeBob SquarePants' six hard, hard ding dongs.

57:24.640 --> 57:27.200
And now I got fired from the bus because I was driving it.

57:28.560 --> 57:30.080
I think it's fine.

57:30.080 --> 57:30.320
Okay.

57:30.320 --> 57:33.840
I think if you're, I think late in the podcast,

57:34.640 --> 57:37.040
things are usually gonna get the most ribald then.

57:37.040 --> 57:37.440
I also think-

57:37.440 --> 57:38.400
I think you probably know that by now.

57:38.400 --> 57:40.400
I also think people will find it really adorable

57:40.400 --> 57:43.040
that when we tried to come up with the most upsetting thing

57:43.040 --> 57:44.480
one might find on the internet,

57:44.480 --> 57:48.160
the best we could do was like SpongeBob erotica.

57:48.160 --> 57:49.280
And they probably said they're going,

57:49.280 --> 57:52.880
well, that's not, let me send you guys some links.

57:52.880 --> 57:54.560
Please don't send us those links.

57:54.560 --> 57:55.920
Please don't take my innocence away.

57:55.920 --> 57:57.680
Travis, you don't know how internet works.

57:57.680 --> 57:59.520
Cause now we are going to get those links.

58:03.120 --> 58:04.160
So we're done.

58:04.160 --> 58:04.960
We're done.

58:04.960 --> 58:05.840
With the podcast.

58:05.840 --> 58:06.800
I hope you liked it.

58:07.600 --> 58:08.720
We made it for you.

58:08.720 --> 58:10.240
So that's, I mean, that's the hope.

58:11.600 --> 58:14.000
And I wanted to say a quick thank you.

58:14.000 --> 58:18.560
We received a bunch of things in the old PO box

58:19.760 --> 58:23.760
that I mean, like I had to fill the trunk of my car

58:24.800 --> 58:26.720
with gifts.

58:26.720 --> 58:28.240
Hey, bring some of those to Boston, please.

58:29.280 --> 58:30.080
Okay.

58:30.080 --> 58:33.600
No, when you guys come here later on this year,

58:33.600 --> 58:34.560
you can take them with you though.

58:34.560 --> 58:35.120
Yeah, okay.

58:35.120 --> 58:36.400
I'm saving it in a closet.

58:36.400 --> 58:41.520
Erica, it makes her own candles

58:41.520 --> 58:48.720
and she made themed candles for our shows,

58:48.720 --> 58:49.920
which is really cool.

58:49.920 --> 58:52.480
She calls them, this is a cute, fandals.

58:54.880 --> 58:56.480
What's the big gulp one smell like?

58:57.760 --> 58:58.160
Okay.

58:58.160 --> 59:03.680
That's not one of them, but she has a shop on Etsy

59:03.680 --> 59:04.640
called Wick Habit.

59:04.640 --> 59:08.000
And you can check out some of her candles there.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.440
All the ones she sent us smell great.

59:09.440 --> 59:10.080
I'm saving them.

59:10.080 --> 59:13.360
There's a rose buddies one that smells exactly like roses.

59:14.160 --> 59:15.040
It's very uncanny.

59:15.840 --> 59:17.680
But thanks to her.

59:17.680 --> 59:22.960
Thank you to Matthew for sending me some Jimmy Buffett shoes

59:22.960 --> 59:26.800
and thanks to Lynn for filming Jimmy Buffett saying hi to me.

59:27.600 --> 59:30.080
That was very kind of him

59:30.080 --> 59:32.480
and it made my father-in-law proud of me

59:32.480 --> 59:33.680
for the first time in my life.

59:34.240 --> 59:37.520
And also congratulations by the way,

59:37.520 --> 59:40.080
because we won't record again till after this has happened.

59:40.080 --> 59:44.240
Congratulations to Lynn on wrapping up his tenure in Hamilton.

59:44.240 --> 59:46.240
His last performance is July 9th.

59:46.240 --> 59:50.160
So congrats to him and what an accomplishment.

59:50.160 --> 59:52.400
And also Blair sent us Dad Magazine,

59:52.400 --> 59:55.280
which she edited and is a book called Dad Magazine.

59:55.280 --> 59:56.560
So that's pretty great.

59:56.560 --> 59:56.880
Thanks.

59:56.880 --> 59:59.200
I want to say congratulations to you, Justin,

59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.360
on your 10 year wedding anniversary, which is today.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:01.840
Yeah.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:02.480
The day we're recording the podcast.

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:03.600
Thank you so much.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.160
Congratulations dude.

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:04.800
Thank you so much.

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:06.160
July 1st, it's been 10 years.

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:07.440
It's crazy.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.800
I also want to say we're very, very excited.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.000
We've got a guestbook coming up.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:10.960
Yeah.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.920
And it's been a while since the guestbook.

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.680
So just to remind you, we're going to have guests on.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.720
You're going to submit questions specifically for that guest to answer.

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:20.800
That guest is going to be Patrick Rothfuss,

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:23.280
who is one of my favorite authors,

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:24.880
if not my favorite author,

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.400
author of the Kingkiller Chronicles.

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:28.000
And that's going to be,

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.440
we're recording just a few days after this episode.

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.920
So if you've got questions for Patrick Rothfuss.

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:36.240
Advice questions.

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.880
Remember, like you need advice from him.

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:39.120
Yeah.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:41.200
Not just like trivia questions or something.

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.160
The next book's coming out.

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:43.600
Please don't fucking ask that.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.360
It's not cool.

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:46.240
Ask about advice.

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:50.320
But yeah, send those in and make sure to put in the subject line

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.080
something like, you know, for Patrick Rothfuss.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:53.600
And speaking of-

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:54.640
Make sure, oh, sorry.

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:55.040
Go ahead, Jeff.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.440
Well, we also have our Boston show coming up.

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.240
And so we're going to need questions for that.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:04.320
So make sure you put Boston live show in the subject line for those.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:09.840
And just want to remind you to send your favorite fish tracks to

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:12.240
at Travis McElroy on Twitter.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:13.360
Definitely.

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:15.280
Maybe we want to start with something from like Billy Breeze,

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:16.720
something real accessible like that.

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:19.120
But, you know, it's up to you all, whatever you think.

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:22.640
And Travis will review each track and let you know what he thinks about it.

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:23.200
Yeah.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:23.700
And-

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.640
We're all very excited to hear his book report.

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:27.680
Two things real quick.

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.120
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.640
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure.

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:31.840
Off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:33.280
Fucking fantastic album.

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:35.360
If you're going on a summer road trip, driving down to the beach,

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.160
put that album on.

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:36.720
Good times.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.040
Also, I can't remember if I mentioned this last week,

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.040
but I just opened up a PO box here in Austin.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000
It is PO box 66639, Austin, Texas 78766.

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.160
Yeah.

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:50.480
Just want to put that into the ecosystem.

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:50.880
Are we done?

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:54.080
I want to say check out all the other Amazing Maximum Fun shows.

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:55.760
There's lots of new ones to check out.

01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:00.000
But I would like to take a second to specifically push two shows.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.160
One, the show that I do with my wife, Schmaners,

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.520
that I am a big fan of.

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:06.640
The episode we did on pregnancy is one of my favorite things

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.600
I've ever recorded.

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.760
And just every week, I'm more and more impressed

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:12.000
with how wonderful my wife is at podcasting.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.240
And also, the recent episode of Still Buffering,

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:18.880
where they had Lin Manuel Miranda on to talk about

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:21.440
like how to do theater in high school and as a teen

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:22.640
and community theater.

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:23.520
And it was wonderful.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.160
They talked a lot about memories that I remember from growing up

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.680
in Huntington with the Smurls.

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:29.840
Lin talked about his years.

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.280
It's really wonderful.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:31.680
It's super good.

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:32.320
I highly recommend it.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.280
There are other shows on the Maximum Fun Network

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:36.480
that we are not a part of, though.

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.640
Like Getting Curious and Judge John Hodgman

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.640
and Jordan Jesse Goh and Stop Podcasting Yourself

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:41.520
and Throwing Shade.

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:43.360
Tons of great shows.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.800
You can find them all at MaximumFun.org.

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:47.600
You can find all the podcasts that we do at McElroyShows.com.

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:49.840
We've been doing this post questions bit

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.040
for like 14 minutes now.

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:52.560
Let's kill it.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.680
Let's put it.

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:54.560
Let's put it to bed.

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:56.400
Hit me, Griffin.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.640
Got a final Yahoo is sent in by Aaron Keys again.

01:02:58.640 --> 01:02:59.360
Thank you, Aaron Keys.

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:00.320
You deserve a nickname.

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:01.600
Just haven't come up with one yet.

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:02.480
We'll workshop it.

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:03.440
The Keys Master.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
I think you described you said keister once.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.480
And yes, I think Aaron tweeted that.

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:09.680
That was not good.

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:10.400
I know that.

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.640
That's why I've continued to try to come up.

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:13.920
I think Keys Master.

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.280
So I'm sticking with right now.

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:16.720
It's terrible.

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:17.440
OK, here we go.

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.360
Joe S. asks,

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:23.600
Does Seattle have culture, class, cuisine, opera,

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.840
all the stuff I see in Frasier?

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:32.880
Why are you Justin McElroy?

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:33.840
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:35.040
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.000
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:50.080
Kiss your dad square on the lips.
