00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:44.640
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna, just say, hey, I wanna.

00:44.640 --> 00:49.200
Hello, everybody, and welcome to Brother Mean Advice Show for the modern era. I'm your oldest

00:49.200 --> 00:53.680
brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy, and I'm your sweet baby

00:53.680 --> 00:57.280
brother, Griffin McElroy. This is the best idea we've ever had. This is a bad idea.

00:57.280 --> 01:00.160
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

01:00.160 --> 01:01.520
It's Trolls Watch.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.280
Trolls Watch. It dies cast.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.200
Nope. Stop. You guys have to put your fucking backs into this bit, or else it won't work.

01:09.200 --> 01:12.160
Griffin, did you not hear me say, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep?

01:12.160 --> 01:18.960
That was mostly for Justin. This is solid gold we've got on our hands, all over our hands. It's

01:18.960 --> 01:22.800
molten gold on our hands like Johnny Tremaine, and we've gotta respect it.

01:22.800 --> 01:28.480
Let's be legit here. It's a two-hander. Well, who are the two stars in this? Is it some B-movie

01:28.480 --> 01:34.720
watch show? No, fuck you. It's Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake starring in this movie. That's

01:34.720 --> 01:39.840
fucking roll gold right there. That's good stuff. Hell yeah, dude. That's Hollywood gold.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.880
Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake. So you know there's gonna be some singing up in this?

01:43.440 --> 01:47.200
You know there's gonna be at least three to four songs in this movie, Trolls.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.840
At least on average 3.5 songs.

01:49.840 --> 01:54.160
Justin, engage us in the Trolls watch. Get in on the bit.

01:54.160 --> 01:58.080
I'm trying to get in on the bit. You guys are leaving such little room for me to just like,

01:58.080 --> 02:02.960
get deep. What are you most excited about the Trolls movie, Justin? Go.

02:02.960 --> 02:06.800
It eventually ends. Well, okay, hold on.

02:06.800 --> 02:11.280
No spoilers, but I heard it's finite. Trolls are back.

02:11.280 --> 02:16.320
I heard Dreamworks had developed a sort of procedurally generated movie technology,

02:16.320 --> 02:22.560
so you can turn on the Trolls movie and it just goes forever because the movie's making itself

02:22.560 --> 02:28.720
as it goes and you kind of follow the Trolls along from their life and then to their death

02:28.720 --> 02:30.960
and then it moves on to new Trolls.

02:30.960 --> 02:35.360
Let me talk about some of the other adaptations of Trolls that Trolls has to follow in the

02:35.360 --> 02:44.480
footsteps of. One such example is a reskinned game that was originally called Dudes with Attitude

02:44.480 --> 02:48.560
that was modified into a game called Trolls on Treasure Island.

02:48.560 --> 02:52.480
Instead of just reading this Wikipedia page about Trolls things that there have been,

02:52.480 --> 02:58.640
Justin, I want to, this thing's just not, this whole vehicle's just not gonna fucking work.

02:58.640 --> 03:04.720
If you personally aren't excited about Trolls, so I want you to tell me about what your favorite

03:04.720 --> 03:13.520
Trolls thing is about Trolls. Mike Mitchell co-directed this film with a person named Walt

03:13.520 --> 03:19.520
Dorn. That means Mike Mitchell was looking at the scope of this project in the alpha stages

03:19.520 --> 03:27.440
and he said, this is too much for one man. I cannot steer this ship by myself.

03:28.240 --> 03:29.040
Justin.

03:29.040 --> 03:29.840
Yup.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.160
Tyler McElroy.

03:32.160 --> 03:32.480
Yes.

03:33.680 --> 03:38.240
What the fuck? I'm not fucking around anymore. Now I'm getting mad.

03:38.240 --> 03:45.040
Mm-mm. What the fuck do you love about Trolls? Not the movie, the whole brand.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.560
The very concept.

03:46.560 --> 03:51.120
The concept of the Trolls, Justin. And I swear to God, if you tell me one more fact about the

03:51.120 --> 03:54.880
Trolls movie that you're just gonna make fun of out of hand before the Trolls movie's out,

03:54.880 --> 04:00.160
I'll quit the podcast. So the stakes are high. What do you love about Trolls?

04:01.120 --> 04:04.320
I like the, I bet they all have-

04:04.320 --> 04:06.720
Please use love. Please use love. Please use love.

04:06.720 --> 04:08.080
Okay.

04:08.080 --> 04:11.760
Please love Justin. You know the tagline, please love Trolls.

04:12.800 --> 04:22.560
I think that I love something about them that they all have their own sort of quirks. You think

04:22.560 --> 04:28.160
that they just all be the same. You like that they're bespoke individuals, but each one has a

04:28.160 --> 04:36.400
soul and an individual set of likes, dislikes, and allergies that make them a unique creature

04:36.400 --> 04:37.680
in the world.

04:37.680 --> 04:41.680
Now, Justin, I hate the papu now that you're finally actually showing some love for the

04:41.680 --> 04:46.480
Trolls. It's a pretty big jump to jump straight to them having souls. I don't know if I'm

04:46.480 --> 04:50.640
comfortable with that. Listen, I love Trolls as much as the next guy.

04:50.640 --> 04:52.640
I love Trolls so much.

04:52.640 --> 04:55.120
But I don't know if Trolls go to heaven, you know?

04:56.160 --> 05:01.120
I'm going to start hitting you, Travis. This is a quiz that's just invented to

05:01.120 --> 05:09.600
build anticipation for Trolls, the movie of Trolls. I'm just going to start naming characters

05:09.600 --> 05:12.400
and you're going to tell me if they're real or fake.

05:12.400 --> 05:15.520
Why does Travis get to do it? I want to do the Trolls quiz.

05:15.520 --> 05:24.560
Oh, well, alternate. We'll alternate and I'll give Griffin stars and he has to tell me if

05:24.560 --> 05:29.360
they're real and I'll give Travis Trolls and you guys have to keep your own score.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.680
Good. Travis. Yes.

05:31.680 --> 05:33.360
Doogie. Real.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.200
Fake. Fuck.

05:36.320 --> 05:38.560
Flincher. Real.

05:38.560 --> 05:39.600
Fake. Okay.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.960
Gorge the Unkillable. Fake.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.640
Now that one's real. That one is real.

05:45.600 --> 05:49.280
And in the movie it's played by Alfred Molina.

05:49.280 --> 05:51.120
DJ Suki. Real.

05:51.760 --> 05:53.600
Yes. Okay, that is a real one.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.120
Griffin. Are you ready?

05:56.000 --> 05:57.840
I'm pivoting. Okay.

05:57.840 --> 06:00.000
I'm pivoting. Steve Buscemi.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.320
Steve Buscemi is a real man in the world, yes.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.920
No, is he in the movie or not?

06:03.920 --> 06:04.960
Is Steve Buscemi in this fucking movie?

06:04.960 --> 06:06.400
I don't know if I'm supposed to know if he's in the movie.

06:06.400 --> 06:09.280
Is it not enough that I know that Steve Buscemi is extant?

06:09.280 --> 06:09.680
Real.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.160
Real. He's a real man.

06:12.160 --> 06:18.080
But I'm saying like, give me, let me know if he's in this fucking movie.

06:18.080 --> 06:20.560
I mean, here's the confusion point.

06:20.560 --> 06:24.240
Steve Buscemi is just 200 Trolls wrapped up in a trench coat.

06:24.240 --> 06:28.320
Yeah, do you mean is Steve Buscemi the actor playing a character in the movie

06:28.320 --> 06:31.600
or does Steve Buscemi as a character appear in the movie?

06:31.600 --> 06:34.080
Is there someone playing Steve Buscemi?

06:34.080 --> 06:36.240
Is Steve Buscemi playing Steve Buscemi?

06:36.240 --> 06:38.320
No, you've taken too many tries at this sentence, Travis.

06:38.320 --> 06:39.600
You just gotta bail on it.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.080
I'm out.

06:40.080 --> 06:42.720
I don't know if Steve Buscemi, I don't know if Steve,

06:42.720 --> 06:46.000
sorry, I gotta do the correct Italian pronunciation.

06:46.000 --> 06:52.160
I don't know if Steve Buscemi is in Trolls, but I do know that Trolls is him.

06:52.800 --> 06:53.120
Yep.

06:53.120 --> 06:56.400
Okay, what about Ron Funches?

06:57.200 --> 06:58.800
That's not a real, that's not a real man.

07:02.320 --> 07:06.320
We played Overwatch with Ron Funches.

07:06.320 --> 07:09.440
We played Overwatch with Ron Funches and he's in this fucking movie.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.880
So I'm excited about Ron Funches' participation.

07:12.880 --> 07:16.960
As am I about the, the fucking cast of this movie is amazing.

07:16.960 --> 07:20.480
Russell Brand, James Corden, Gwen Stefani.

07:20.480 --> 07:21.200
Real, real, real.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.280
I've seen her on The Voice, I know she's real.

07:23.280 --> 07:28.480
Christine Baranski, John Cleese taking the very real risk

07:28.480 --> 07:30.160
that this will be his last film.

07:30.160 --> 07:34.480
Jeffrey Tambor, like they're so, Anna Kendrick, they're so, like this,

07:34.480 --> 07:37.280
this thing's a galaxy of stars.

07:37.280 --> 07:41.600
The night sky is dark because all the stars are in Trolls.

07:41.600 --> 07:45.520
And that's why I'm so fucking rock hard for it, Trolls.

07:45.520 --> 07:48.400
I am fucking rod hard.

07:48.400 --> 07:51.680
November 4th, I know what you boys are doing on your birthdays

07:51.680 --> 07:54.800
and that's getting a fucking, just a Trolls load.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.160
I'm gonna do my hair up.

07:56.160 --> 07:57.440
I'm gonna cosplay.

07:57.440 --> 07:59.680
I'm gonna put a little jam in my belly button.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.600
You're gonna remove your genitals completely.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.440
I'm gonna remove my genitals.

08:03.440 --> 08:06.000
I'm gonna really define my butt crack.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.040
The movie, this, the movie has cinematography by Yong Duk Joon,

08:11.040 --> 08:12.160
according to Wikipedia.

08:12.160 --> 08:14.160
So Yong Duk Joon, I have one question.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.320
Where are these fucking Trolls, my dude?

08:16.320 --> 08:17.680
Don't hold out on me.

08:17.680 --> 08:18.640
You've been to their home.

08:18.640 --> 08:19.280
You've filmed them.

08:19.280 --> 08:20.400
Where are the Trolls, Yong?

08:21.040 --> 08:23.920
Where do you think the Trolls are where they live?

08:23.920 --> 08:25.040
Where do you think it is?

08:25.040 --> 08:25.760
Yong knows.

08:25.760 --> 08:27.520
I don't have to envision this.

08:27.520 --> 08:29.760
I don't have to imagineer this.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.120
Yong knows.

08:31.120 --> 08:32.320
He's cinematographer.

08:32.320 --> 08:33.760
But he'll never tell.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.200
He'll never tell.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.720
I bet it's like Nicaragua.

08:36.720 --> 08:39.280
I bet he fell in love with a Troll woman there.

08:39.280 --> 08:42.320
I bet he married a Troll woman.

08:42.320 --> 08:45.760
But he couldn't bring the Troll back to America.

08:45.760 --> 08:48.160
He couldn't bring the Troll back to America because of laws.

08:48.160 --> 08:52.560
So instead, Steve Buschimi had to smuggle that,

08:52.560 --> 08:55.120
his Troll wife out of Nicaragua.

08:55.120 --> 08:57.920
He made his Troll wife Steve Buschimi's heart.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.520
I love this movie that we've written Trolls 2.

09:01.520 --> 09:02.560
Hit me up, DreamWorks.

09:02.560 --> 09:04.000
We got the sequel already.

09:05.840 --> 09:08.720
It's gonna be a multimedia piece with animation,

09:08.720 --> 09:10.400
but with real life Buschimi.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.480
Like Osmosis Jones was.

09:14.480 --> 09:16.240
One of those.

09:16.240 --> 09:17.600
There's a Troll skateboarder,

09:17.600 --> 09:19.200
and it's played by Ricky Dillon.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.240
He's a YouTube star.

09:20.960 --> 09:21.440
Nice.

09:22.720 --> 09:24.320
Should we do advice?

09:24.320 --> 09:26.080
Hold on, I wanna watch the Trolls trailer.

09:26.080 --> 09:28.960
I'll give you minute by minute reactions.

09:28.960 --> 09:32.000
Yeah, but Trolls is coming November 4th.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.800
November 4th, 2016 to a theater near you.

09:36.160 --> 09:36.800
See you there.

09:37.680 --> 09:38.320
We'll see you there.

09:38.320 --> 09:40.400
We'll be in every theater simultaneously.

09:40.400 --> 09:43.200
We've paid for a hologram of us to be in the front row,

09:43.200 --> 09:45.280
just like losing it.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.720
Losing our fucking minds.

09:48.800 --> 09:49.520
Should be good though.

09:49.520 --> 09:50.160
I mean, it has-

09:50.160 --> 09:51.680
Please read a question.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.360
I trust Ron Funches.

09:55.360 --> 09:56.720
It seems like it'll be a fun-

09:56.720 --> 09:58.480
Yeah, Ron Funches is my co-pilot.

09:58.480 --> 09:58.960
You know what I mean?

09:58.960 --> 10:01.360
That's what it says on all my shirts.

10:01.360 --> 10:01.920
Crap.

10:01.920 --> 10:03.520
I work in an office,

10:03.520 --> 10:06.800
and one of my coworkers has a habit that drives me crazy.

10:07.520 --> 10:09.360
Every time she walks by the open door of my office,

10:09.360 --> 10:10.640
which happens several times per day,

10:10.640 --> 10:12.640
she apparently feels the need to peer in,

10:12.640 --> 10:13.920
just get a good look at me,

10:13.920 --> 10:15.440
before I continue on her way.

10:17.280 --> 10:19.440
She only lingers there for about two seconds,

10:19.440 --> 10:20.800
never says anything,

10:20.800 --> 10:23.120
but it makes me very uncomfortable.

10:23.120 --> 10:23.840
Yeah, dog.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.760
Is there anything I can say or do to make it clear

10:25.760 --> 10:27.840
that this is weirding me out without being mean?

10:27.840 --> 10:29.440
That's from a self-conscious intern.

10:30.320 --> 10:33.040
The one piece of information we have failed to receive

10:33.040 --> 10:34.240
in this question is,

10:34.240 --> 10:38.160
what look is on her face when she does this?

10:38.160 --> 10:39.680
Is this a look of like,

10:39.680 --> 10:42.160
is she perplexed by your presence?

10:42.720 --> 10:45.520
Does she look like she's memorizing every detail?

10:45.520 --> 10:48.560
Is she amused by you being there working?

10:48.560 --> 10:50.880
Like, what is, or is she just like,

10:50.880 --> 10:53.360
oh, huh, he's still here.

10:53.360 --> 10:56.560
And then going on, huh, still here, huh?

10:56.560 --> 10:58.640
It's just, I just think some people

10:58.640 --> 11:00.720
it's just being a nosy, rosy Perez.

11:00.720 --> 11:01.200
Just a nosy Parker.

11:01.200 --> 11:04.480
Like some people, there's just nothing you can do about it.

11:04.480 --> 11:06.640
Like, they're not checking you out.

11:06.640 --> 11:08.160
They're not checking you out,

11:08.160 --> 11:10.400
and they're not making eyes at you.

11:10.400 --> 11:14.960
They just gotta scope out the scene of the whole office.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.840
Is it possible that at one point

11:17.840 --> 11:20.080
you did something very cool in there?

11:21.120 --> 11:22.800
Did you at one point do something like,

11:24.320 --> 11:26.720
so choice, like some sort of, I don't know,

11:26.720 --> 11:28.000
what would that be like?

11:28.000 --> 11:31.760
Oh damn, I walked by Mark's office and I looked in the door

11:31.760 --> 11:34.800
and he was doing a fucking 900 right there.

11:34.800 --> 11:36.160
It was amazing.

11:36.160 --> 11:39.760
He went off the desk 900 in the air.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.200
He boneless Christ aired it.

11:41.200 --> 11:46.320
He ordered a 12 of boneless Jesus with Buffalo sauce.

11:49.040 --> 11:51.120
It was the tightest shit I ever did see.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.080
And never again.

11:52.080 --> 11:52.880
Get a nose grind.

11:53.840 --> 11:57.360
He did like astral projection and I could see another Mark.

11:57.360 --> 11:58.880
There was the Mark you and I know,

11:58.880 --> 12:01.600
and then there was Mark sort of like spewing it,

12:01.600 --> 12:03.200
and he was just like floating.

12:03.200 --> 12:06.160
I walked by and dreamed a dream of infinite Mark

12:06.160 --> 12:10.000
and I could see Mark as far as my mind would allow.

12:10.000 --> 12:15.600
And ever since that day, I've just craved that high again.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.920
And Mark has withheld it from me.

12:17.920 --> 12:19.920
But one day I shall catch.

12:19.920 --> 12:21.520
Yeah, here's a question.

12:21.520 --> 12:23.920
Does your coworker like lower their sun glasses

12:23.920 --> 12:25.200
and go like, oh yeah.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.440
I mean, maybe every time this happens

12:29.440 --> 12:31.520
you can just look at them and go, how am I doing?

12:31.520 --> 12:34.480
And like, or like, what do you think?

12:34.480 --> 12:36.160
And maybe just see where they're at.

12:36.160 --> 12:38.000
Maybe they're just waiting for you to engage with.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.240
Maybe, ooh, maybe this person really wants to be your friend

12:42.240 --> 12:43.920
or like make some kind of connection with you,

12:43.920 --> 12:47.280
but they have no, like they don't know how to instigate.

12:47.280 --> 12:49.440
And they're like, if I just kind of like make my,

12:49.440 --> 12:50.800
if I put myself out there,

12:51.360 --> 12:53.600
they'll take the other half a step towards me,

12:53.600 --> 12:56.240
metaphorically speaking, and they'll engage with me.

12:56.240 --> 12:57.600
And then we can become friends.

12:57.600 --> 13:00.000
Hmm.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.440
Or they're gonna kill you.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.040
Or they're planning to kill you.

13:03.680 --> 13:04.800
It's one of those two.

13:06.560 --> 13:07.600
What's their job?

13:07.600 --> 13:10.160
Hey, have you ever clarified what this person's job is?

13:10.160 --> 13:10.880
Maybe they're insecure.

13:10.880 --> 13:12.000
Do they even work there?

13:12.000 --> 13:12.960
Are they insecurity?

13:13.760 --> 13:15.920
Maybe they're just like being very thorough,

13:15.920 --> 13:18.720
making sure there's no threats around you.

13:18.720 --> 13:20.400
You know, you can, if you're a ninja,

13:20.400 --> 13:21.520
you can be a potted plant,

13:21.520 --> 13:23.840
like pretend to be a potted plant very well.

13:23.840 --> 13:26.480
The army has all kinds of tech that they know about

13:26.480 --> 13:29.200
where they, you can like hide on a brick wall or whatever.

13:29.200 --> 13:29.520
Camouflage.

13:29.520 --> 13:30.320
That's a good point.

13:30.320 --> 13:33.520
Yeah, like they're just checking out to make sure you're safe.

13:33.520 --> 13:34.720
You're welcome, by the way.

13:34.720 --> 13:35.600
I mean, not that you've ever been there before.

13:35.600 --> 13:38.000
Maybe they were standing around the water cooler

13:38.000 --> 13:39.040
and they heard someone go,

13:39.040 --> 13:40.800
you know, I think I'm gonna kill Mark later.

13:41.360 --> 13:42.640
And they were like, what?

13:43.360 --> 13:45.840
Not today and not tomorrow.

13:45.840 --> 13:48.000
But at some point when he least expects it,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.240
I will be there like a grim specter

13:50.240 --> 13:51.760
waiting to gobble up his soul.

13:51.760 --> 13:54.160
I hope no one is looking when it happens

13:54.160 --> 13:56.560
because they'll be the only ones able to stop me.

13:56.560 --> 13:58.800
I think I know what the situation is.

13:58.800 --> 13:59.280
Uh-oh.

13:59.840 --> 14:03.040
I think we have a little man situation on our hands.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.880
The Wayans Brothers vehicle.

14:05.840 --> 14:06.160
Okay.

14:06.160 --> 14:07.840
Because in that movie,

14:09.200 --> 14:11.440
in that horrible movie.

14:11.440 --> 14:12.880
In that horror movie.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.680
I'm gonna use the Wikipedia description.

14:17.680 --> 14:20.320
Calvin Babyface Sims, Marlon Wayans,

14:20.320 --> 14:21.840
is a very short convict.

14:21.840 --> 14:24.960
Did a jewel heist and hid the gem somewhere.

14:24.960 --> 14:27.760
That, anyway, the whole thing resulted in him

14:27.760 --> 14:31.040
having to pretend to be a baby and Jesus.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.000
Problematic.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.360
Problematic to the max.

14:35.360 --> 14:38.160
But I think what happened here, jewel heist happened.

14:38.160 --> 14:42.960
She had to stash the gemstones in your office somewhere.

14:42.960 --> 14:45.840
And so she always comes in and she's never found a window

14:45.840 --> 14:46.720
because you're always in there.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.200
You're a workaholic and a dunkaholic.

14:49.200 --> 14:50.320
And you're always in there.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.000
Working and dunking.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.320
And she always pokes in and she's like,

14:54.320 --> 14:55.520
are my gemstones still?

14:55.520 --> 14:57.360
Fuck, Mark's still in here.

14:57.360 --> 15:01.120
Mark, I've had to work at this job for like seven months now

15:01.120 --> 15:02.720
and I'm getting really good at it.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.720
But I need to get in there and get my gemstones.

15:04.720 --> 15:07.280
Is it possible it's a big situation?

15:07.280 --> 15:08.480
And she's been made big.

15:08.480 --> 15:09.040
Oh, fuck.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.560
She's been made big.

15:10.560 --> 15:13.120
And she thinks that there might be a Zoltar machine

15:13.120 --> 15:15.520
in somebody's office, but she's not sure who's.

15:15.520 --> 15:16.160
So she-

15:16.160 --> 15:18.480
Are you an intern at a Zoltar machine?

15:18.480 --> 15:21.040
Are you an intern at a Zoltar repair place?

15:21.600 --> 15:23.040
Are you yourself Zoltar?

15:23.040 --> 15:24.080
Okay, wait.

15:24.080 --> 15:24.960
Oh wait, hold on.

15:24.960 --> 15:26.320
If you're Zoltar, you have to tell us.

15:26.320 --> 15:27.680
Are you Zoltar?

15:27.680 --> 15:30.240
Because if you're Zoltar and your office is a box

15:30.800 --> 15:32.400
that is in the hallway,

15:32.400 --> 15:36.400
you can't be surprised when this person who has been bigged

15:36.400 --> 15:37.600
looks at you every day

15:37.600 --> 15:39.680
because they're thinking about the decisions they've made

15:39.680 --> 15:40.640
and if they're ready to go back

15:40.640 --> 15:43.600
or if their work on this plane of bigness is done.

15:44.400 --> 15:45.600
That is how the movie works.

15:45.600 --> 15:48.400
He couldn't go back to small until his work was complete.

15:49.760 --> 15:50.560
I'm sorry.

15:50.560 --> 15:53.200
I can't shrink you again, Tom Hanks.

15:53.200 --> 15:56.480
You haven't completed the task I presented you with.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.320
Why haven't I shrunk?

15:59.120 --> 16:04.080
So we've considered the little man possibilities

16:04.080 --> 16:05.520
and the big possibilities.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.600
Is there an average person movie?

16:09.760 --> 16:11.200
Maybe it's a meet Dave scenario.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.640
I was thinking meet Dave.

16:12.640 --> 16:14.880
Why is that my average size?

16:14.880 --> 16:17.520
Because that's about tiny people in a normal sized body.

16:18.240 --> 16:19.200
Okay, wait.

16:19.200 --> 16:19.680
Nope.

16:19.680 --> 16:20.080
Got it.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.680
It's not a meet Dave scenario.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.600
It's a Dave scenario, okay?

16:23.600 --> 16:24.000
Okay.

16:25.440 --> 16:26.400
The sequel to Dave.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.520
You've met Dave.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.000
No, no, no.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
It's the one where Kevin Kline is an impersonator.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.840
That's just called Dave still.

16:31.840 --> 16:32.640
No, I know, Justin.

16:32.640 --> 16:33.520
I know it's a different movie,

16:33.520 --> 16:35.360
but it's still definitely in the Dave-a-verse.

16:36.960 --> 16:40.000
Okay, so this person is an impersonator

16:40.000 --> 16:42.160
of the original person that walked by your office

16:42.160 --> 16:44.640
who's currently in a coma in a secret bunker.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.360
Under the building, the very first day,

16:48.720 --> 16:52.240
the day before she was emerged in the coma,

16:52.240 --> 16:54.880
she did take a long look at your office,

16:54.880 --> 16:58.160
but just like happenstance, like she just happened to do it.

16:58.160 --> 17:01.120
But the imposter who is now in her place saw her do it

17:01.120 --> 17:02.320
and believes that that's an important part

17:02.320 --> 17:03.680
of her everyday ritual.

17:03.680 --> 17:06.560
So it is not that the person has anything to gain.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.400
They're just trying to complete this illusion.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.400
So nobody, for the good of the country,

17:10.400 --> 17:12.880
that nobody suspects that that is not actually Susan.

17:12.880 --> 17:16.480
It might also be a Matrix scenario

17:16.480 --> 17:19.440
where every time you see Susan stop and look,

17:19.440 --> 17:21.680
that's actually a weird deja vu moment

17:21.680 --> 17:23.760
where something has changed within the Matrix.

17:23.760 --> 17:25.200
I would suggest checking windows

17:25.200 --> 17:26.720
to see if they've become bricked up.

17:27.680 --> 17:32.080
Maybe the stairs have elongated is, I don't know.

17:32.080 --> 17:34.720
Is there like a guy in sunglasses nearby?

17:34.720 --> 17:36.560
Because if so, do not trust that guy.

17:37.280 --> 17:38.880
I haven't seen the Matrix in a while.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.080
What else happened to that movie?

17:40.080 --> 17:41.360
How about a Yahoo?

17:41.360 --> 17:42.160
Yeah.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.160
This one was sent in by level 9000 Yajuru Drew.

17:44.160 --> 17:44.960
Drew Davenport, thank you.

17:44.960 --> 17:48.080
Drew, it's by Yajuru Answers User, question mark?

17:48.080 --> 17:51.520
Only it's not like the question mark that auto fills in

17:51.520 --> 17:52.800
when it's like an anonymous user.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.720
Like they pick their name and their name is question mark.

17:54.720 --> 17:55.120
Great job.

17:55.760 --> 17:56.720
Like the word, wait, hold on.

17:56.720 --> 17:57.600
The words, question mark?

17:57.600 --> 17:58.800
No, it's the symbol.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.080
The Unicode symbol.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.840
Anyway, question mark asks,

18:03.200 --> 18:06.880
where exactly is the F word in Now You See Me Too?

18:07.760 --> 18:09.120
Okay, yes.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.120
Like time code?

18:11.120 --> 18:14.960
I mean, we don't have to get hidden in the background.

18:14.960 --> 18:16.560
Yeah, I don't think we need to get that specific.

18:16.560 --> 18:18.320
Well, I mean, if it's got that PG-13 rating,

18:18.320 --> 18:18.960
which I think it does,

18:18.960 --> 18:20.960
because this is a fucking magical family heist

18:20.960 --> 18:22.080
that the family can enjoy.

18:23.680 --> 18:25.680
And they want to just make sure the kids

18:26.480 --> 18:31.600
go get some more goobers during the F word scene.

18:32.240 --> 18:35.040
Oh, so this is like a run P kind of scenario

18:35.040 --> 18:38.240
where we need to know like exactly when the F word comes.

18:38.240 --> 18:42.160
So you're gonna be like, go get more butter on the popcorn

18:42.160 --> 18:44.720
in five, four, three.

18:44.720 --> 18:46.720
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

18:46.720 --> 18:49.200
And then you hear Woody Harrelson like, well, fuck.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.120
And it's like, no, you weren't fast enough.

18:51.120 --> 18:51.840
I told you to run.

18:51.840 --> 18:52.800
God damn it.

18:53.520 --> 18:54.960
You fucking idiot kid.

18:55.920 --> 18:57.840
I've always thought that this was to be the hardest part

18:57.840 --> 19:00.240
of making a PG-13 movie

19:00.240 --> 19:03.280
of like really sitting down like with the screenwriter

19:03.280 --> 19:04.640
and the director and the stars

19:04.640 --> 19:07.280
and like very judiciously deciding

19:07.280 --> 19:08.640
where you're gonna put the fuck.

19:08.640 --> 19:11.040
Yeah, Woody Harrelson opens up the script for Now You See Me Too

19:11.040 --> 19:13.200
and he's like, well, most of this is garbage.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.440
And then he waits a bit and he says,

19:15.440 --> 19:17.040
oh, but I get the fuck word?

19:17.040 --> 19:18.160
Oh, hell yeah.

19:18.160 --> 19:19.440
Yeah, fuck yeah.

19:19.440 --> 19:20.480
If I'm the one that gets it,

19:20.480 --> 19:22.560
I thought you were gonna give it to Jesse Eisenberg,

19:22.560 --> 19:25.120
but you gave it to me and I think I earned it.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.960
It's my first F word in a movie.

19:26.960 --> 19:28.640
I'm really excited to do it.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.200
You're not giving it to little Franco, are you?

19:31.200 --> 19:33.680
You're not giving it to the small Franco, are you?

19:34.720 --> 19:36.560
Don't give it to little Franco.

19:36.560 --> 19:40.480
Don't give it to, I don't know who else is in my damn movie.

19:41.840 --> 19:44.000
Is the Ruffalo Buffalo in this movie?

19:44.000 --> 19:45.840
Don't give it to the Ruffalo Buffalo.

19:45.840 --> 19:48.160
I don't think Ruffalo Buffalo made it this time.

19:48.960 --> 19:51.680
I don't think he made the cut in Now You See Me Too.

19:51.680 --> 19:54.720
He's too busy being that Hulk there in that other movie.

19:54.720 --> 19:56.160
Can the Hulk be in our movie?

19:56.160 --> 19:56.960
That'd be pretty good.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.040
Is it too late to put, we can't put-

19:59.040 --> 20:00.560
We can put the Ruffalo Buffalo in,

20:00.560 --> 20:02.400
but he actually has a clause in his contract

20:02.400 --> 20:05.200
that demands he gets the F word in every movie he's in.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.840
Can we say it simultaneously?

20:07.840 --> 20:09.200
Might be like we look at each other

20:09.200 --> 20:12.160
and in some kind of dramatic moment we both go, oh fuck.

20:12.160 --> 20:14.240
Probably my favorite scene in Now You See Me Too

20:14.240 --> 20:16.640
where Ruffalo Buffalo and William Harrison look at each other

20:16.640 --> 20:19.920
at the same time and just go, fuck.

20:19.920 --> 20:22.320
And neither one of them wants to be the first one to end it.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.320
So it actually goes for like four minutes.

20:24.320 --> 20:30.000
It's like, if you had a five minute fuck in your movie,

20:30.000 --> 20:33.440
does that still count as one fuck towards the rating?

20:33.440 --> 20:38.960
Yeah. If your movie is just someone saying the word fuck

20:38.960 --> 20:41.840
for two hours, but just one, then does it?

20:41.840 --> 20:43.040
Yeah, I don't know if that counts.

20:43.040 --> 20:47.040
With one boob out, just one boob out and saying fuck.

20:47.040 --> 20:49.360
And like, that's PG-13, they got me.

20:49.360 --> 20:51.200
Maybe it's not to send your kids out.

20:51.200 --> 20:54.880
Maybe the easier thing is to just wait for the moment

20:54.880 --> 20:58.800
and you kind of like do like they do on TV,

20:58.800 --> 21:00.720
but very loud in the theater.

21:00.720 --> 21:02.400
So just like when the moment comes,

21:02.400 --> 21:06.000
you're just like, chother clucker.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Hey, he's a lover.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.440
He said chother clucker.

21:09.440 --> 21:10.240
So you're fine.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.320
Nothing's bad in this film.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.000
Look at me.

21:14.000 --> 21:14.480
Look at me.

21:14.480 --> 21:15.280
Don't look at the screen.

21:16.080 --> 21:17.200
We've danced around it though.

21:17.200 --> 21:21.680
I am genuinely curious what, where in Now You See Me Too,

21:21.680 --> 21:24.960
Now You Can See Me Too, does the-

21:24.960 --> 21:26.000
Now You Have Seen Me.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.080
Now You Can't See Me Too.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.040
John Cena story.

21:29.040 --> 21:32.400
I think it's the one moment when Jesse Eisenberg

21:33.120 --> 21:35.600
blows the card trick and he's like, is this your card?

21:35.600 --> 21:37.680
And they're like, no, it was actually like the queen of spade.

21:37.680 --> 21:38.320
And he goes, fuck.

21:39.440 --> 21:42.400
That's the one moment it happens in the first five minutes of the movie.

21:42.400 --> 21:47.360
Why are you concerned about your child learning the fuck word,

21:47.360 --> 21:52.080
but not concerned about them learning how to steal with magic?

21:52.080 --> 21:53.600
That's not who you want your-

21:53.600 --> 21:59.360
But just when you're going down to enjoy an EL fudge and you open the package

21:59.360 --> 22:00.240
and what comes out?

22:00.240 --> 22:00.800
Doves.

22:01.360 --> 22:01.600
What?

22:02.320 --> 22:03.600
My child stole the-

22:03.600 --> 22:05.360
Delicious chocolate filled doves.

22:05.360 --> 22:08.080
My child stole the EL fudge with magic.

22:08.720 --> 22:11.280
You open up an EL fudge and all the chocolate crème inside.

22:11.280 --> 22:12.640
Listen guys, we're R rated.

22:12.640 --> 22:13.840
You could say EL fuck.

22:14.560 --> 22:15.040
It's okay.

22:17.280 --> 22:18.560
We have an explicit tag.

22:18.560 --> 22:19.040
It's okay.

22:20.480 --> 22:22.320
Hey, I do want to point out though.

22:22.320 --> 22:22.880
Please.

22:22.880 --> 22:28.400
We have really taken a lot of trips to the cinema in this episode, huh?

22:29.360 --> 22:31.680
It's a very cinema heavy episode.

22:31.680 --> 22:36.080
That's the thing about when you see or get excited about a movie like Trolls.

22:36.080 --> 22:39.360
It just kind of sets you on fire for the whole craft.

22:39.360 --> 22:42.000
Where does the F word come in Trolls?

22:42.000 --> 22:42.960
Right at the top.

22:42.960 --> 22:44.400
At the end, after the credits-

22:44.400 --> 22:45.760
We're fucking Trolls.

22:46.320 --> 22:48.720
At the end, after the credits, Spider-Man drops down.

22:48.720 --> 22:54.320
He's like, fuck.

22:54.320 --> 22:56.000
What's up with these fucking Trolls?

22:57.680 --> 22:58.480
The movie starts.

22:58.480 --> 22:59.280
The movie opens up.

22:59.280 --> 23:00.240
Spider-Man away.

23:00.240 --> 23:05.600
The movie opens up and it's just a white room and real Justin Timberlake just walks towards

23:05.600 --> 23:07.120
the camera and it takes him a while to get there.

23:07.120 --> 23:10.560
And finally, when he's occupying the whole of the frame, he just leans in close and he

23:10.560 --> 23:12.560
just goes, fuck you.

23:12.560 --> 23:13.520
And the movie starts.

23:17.280 --> 23:18.000
Did you see Trolls?

23:18.000 --> 23:20.320
Yeah, Justin signed on to do the movie.

23:20.320 --> 23:20.720
It's amazing.

23:20.720 --> 23:23.200
He does have this one thing.

23:26.160 --> 23:27.920
Alfred Hitchcock comes out.

23:28.720 --> 23:32.720
The story of Trolls is a long story.

23:32.720 --> 23:34.160
Good evening, fuckers.

23:38.160 --> 23:39.680
The lion at the beginning.

23:39.680 --> 23:49.520
You know, Morgan Freeman is in Now You See Me 2.

23:49.520 --> 23:51.360
Have we ever gotten an F word out of that guy?

23:51.360 --> 23:54.240
Because I bet it's really good.

23:54.240 --> 23:57.920
I bet he says it and it changes the way everybody else says it for the rest of time.

23:59.200 --> 24:02.000
Fucking penguins, am I right?

24:02.000 --> 24:03.440
What's their fucking deal?

24:03.440 --> 24:06.160
Look at these black and white fuckers.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.560
Look at this waddling motherfucker over here.

24:08.560 --> 24:11.840
Look at this fucker just eating a fucking fish.

24:13.040 --> 24:13.920
What's his fucking deal?

24:13.920 --> 24:15.520
What's his fucking deal?

24:16.560 --> 24:19.280
What's the fucking deal with penguins?

24:19.280 --> 24:23.280
I gotta tell you about a motherfucker named Andy Dufresne.

24:26.320 --> 24:28.960
And that's what gave Shawshank Redemption its R rating.

24:28.960 --> 24:30.080
No, it was PG-13.

24:30.080 --> 24:31.680
He got the only F word.

24:31.680 --> 24:34.240
Get busy living or get busy dying.

24:34.240 --> 24:34.740
Fuck!

24:34.740 --> 24:38.980
What if he's bad at saying it?

24:38.980 --> 24:41.140
And that's why he's never said it in a movie.

24:41.140 --> 24:44.820
So he's like, I want to tell you about Andy fucking Dufresne.

24:46.820 --> 24:48.980
Can we get another read on that, Mr. Freeman?

24:48.980 --> 24:50.420
Yeah, yeah, here it comes.

24:50.420 --> 24:52.420
I'd like to fuck tell you about-

24:52.420 --> 24:54.900
You put it in a really weird spot that time.

24:56.180 --> 24:57.620
You guys ready for a trash story?

24:58.180 --> 24:59.140
Oh, shit.

24:59.780 --> 25:01.300
My dad was a garbage-

25:01.300 --> 25:03.460
Wait, Griffin's gotta do the trash story jingle.

25:03.460 --> 25:07.460
Trash story, teach me to find myself.

25:09.460 --> 25:12.820
My dad was a garbage man in my hometown of about 2,000 people.

25:12.820 --> 25:16.980
There were a number of exciting finds and obligatory porn slash sex toys.

25:16.980 --> 25:20.660
But the coolest thing he ever found was this unmarked VHS tape.

25:20.660 --> 25:24.580
It was entirely filled with footage of purported UFOs and commentary

25:24.580 --> 25:28.580
from what appears to be some kind of NASA slash military organization.

25:28.580 --> 25:33.780
He said he didn't remember whose house he picked it up from, but I'm sure he did.

25:33.780 --> 25:35.780
Don't know what happened to the tape,

25:35.780 --> 25:40.020
and I'm almost completely sure that the CAIA took it from our movie shelf,

25:40.020 --> 25:40.900
and that's from Cole.

25:42.260 --> 25:43.940
That was a horrible rescue talk,

25:45.620 --> 25:51.380
because there's a lot of VHS ghosts out there.

25:52.020 --> 25:53.620
Like you do not, you absolutely-

25:53.620 --> 25:54.980
I would say any unmarked-

25:54.980 --> 25:57.860
In fact, even marked tapes, that's how they get you.

25:57.860 --> 26:01.700
You throw in a Black Diamond Disney classic Beauty and the Beast,

26:01.700 --> 26:05.540
like here we go, time to get ensorcelled by a story of transformative love.

26:06.100 --> 26:08.420
But no, there's a dang ghost in there,

26:08.420 --> 26:10.820
and it crawls out of your screen, strangles your dad.

26:10.820 --> 26:13.380
Sometimes you get a ghost, sometimes you get a fart touch,

26:13.380 --> 26:14.500
and you can never be sure.

26:15.620 --> 26:17.380
I know I'm actually not sure which one's better.

26:19.620 --> 26:21.540
You know there's a sequel to The Ring coming out?

26:22.580 --> 26:23.380
Yeah.

26:23.380 --> 26:27.220
I wonder how much of a plot point find of VCRs it's gonna be.

26:27.220 --> 26:28.980
Do you think it's gonna be a plot point?

26:28.980 --> 26:32.100
Like, oh, this is very spooky tape.

26:32.100 --> 26:33.140
Just hold on a second.

26:33.700 --> 26:34.260
I bet.

26:34.260 --> 26:35.940
I'm gonna go out to the storage room.

26:35.940 --> 26:38.180
There's one scene where they played on the VHS,

26:38.180 --> 26:39.460
and then they played on the Blu-ray,

26:39.460 --> 26:41.700
and they compare the quality of The Ring footage.

26:41.700 --> 26:42.660
I'm like, this is way better.

26:42.660 --> 26:44.580
You can really see all the differences.

26:44.580 --> 26:46.100
I'm gonna die in like seven minutes.

26:46.100 --> 26:46.660
This is great.

26:47.300 --> 26:48.020
This is great.

26:48.020 --> 26:48.500
I love this.

26:48.500 --> 26:49.940
And in the Blu-ray version,

26:49.940 --> 26:51.860
you can see the cords and stuff on the ground

26:51.860 --> 26:53.460
that you couldn't normally see otherwise.

26:53.460 --> 26:56.020
Yes, it's unformative.

27:00.020 --> 27:00.420
You know what?

27:00.420 --> 27:01.700
It's not actually that scary.

27:01.700 --> 27:03.220
Now that I see it, this is death.

27:03.220 --> 27:04.420
It's actually not that bad.

27:04.420 --> 27:05.940
I don't think I'm actually gonna die.

27:05.940 --> 27:08.900
Yeah, I just watched The Ring video on Netflix.

27:08.900 --> 27:09.540
It was great.

27:09.540 --> 27:11.060
I just picked it up whenever I wanted to.

27:11.060 --> 27:12.740
I was able to watch the whole thing in one day.

27:12.740 --> 27:13.460
It was amazing.

27:13.460 --> 27:15.700
So I tried to watch it with the director's commentary,

27:15.700 --> 27:17.860
but the whole time the director's just like,

27:17.860 --> 27:19.140
it's pretty spooky, isn't it?

27:20.180 --> 27:23.060
This is a spooky scene here coming out with a little girl.

27:23.060 --> 27:23.620
Hold on.

27:23.620 --> 27:25.380
Wait, this is a spooky one.

27:25.380 --> 27:27.780
Oh no, look at her.

27:27.780 --> 27:28.900
You might not believe this.

27:28.900 --> 27:30.580
It took that little girl a few minutes

27:30.580 --> 27:31.700
to climb out of that well.

27:31.700 --> 27:33.300
So we just jumped ahead a little bit.

27:34.500 --> 27:36.900
She's gonna come up and throttle the life out of you,

27:36.900 --> 27:37.780
though, look out.

27:37.780 --> 27:38.580
Here he comes.

27:38.580 --> 27:40.260
You see that spooky wafting tree?

27:40.260 --> 27:41.300
You're not gonna believe this,

27:41.300 --> 27:43.860
but that was actually my Uncle Doug.

27:43.860 --> 27:45.220
He wanted to be in a movie

27:45.220 --> 27:46.980
and he loaned me the money to make the movie.

27:46.980 --> 27:47.940
And I said, you can be in a movie.

27:47.940 --> 27:48.900
Oh, you're dead.

27:48.900 --> 27:52.980
Oh no, you died before I finished my little speech.

27:52.980 --> 27:54.900
I'm gonna keep going if that's okay, Silly.

27:54.900 --> 27:56.900
This is flies on a corpse.

27:58.260 --> 27:58.980
Pretty spooky.

27:58.980 --> 28:02.020
I think it's supposed to represent how life continues

28:02.020 --> 28:03.460
and everything's okay.

28:03.460 --> 28:05.620
You know, sometimes things happen,

28:05.620 --> 28:07.060
but then you gotta look on the bright side

28:07.060 --> 28:08.020
and you make flies.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.700
People never finish this movie

28:09.700 --> 28:11.380
if you watch all the way to the end.

28:11.380 --> 28:13.060
At the end, Spider-Man comes down.

28:13.060 --> 28:14.420
He's just like, fuck.

28:15.540 --> 28:18.660
That was actually why this did not get a wider distribution.

28:18.660 --> 28:20.180
I didn't have the rights for that character.

28:20.980 --> 28:22.260
All right, let's get the money, sir.

28:33.060 --> 28:34.980
I would like to tell you a true story.

28:34.980 --> 28:35.300
Please.

28:36.100 --> 28:38.420
As Teresa and I moved across the country,

28:38.420 --> 28:40.740
we had to look through our possessions

28:40.740 --> 28:42.500
and make a lot of tough choices

28:42.500 --> 28:44.580
as to what was going to go into a storage unit

28:44.580 --> 28:46.500
and be locked away from us for a month.

28:46.500 --> 28:49.220
And what we absolutely positively needed

28:49.860 --> 28:51.860
in Huntington with us for the month of September.

28:52.580 --> 28:54.100
And I could tell you,

28:54.980 --> 28:56.340
one of the things on the shortlist

28:56.340 --> 28:57.700
that was never in doubt

28:57.700 --> 28:59.620
is our set of Bull and Branch sheets.

28:59.620 --> 29:01.300
This is no exaggeration.

29:01.300 --> 29:03.780
We had that shit shipped to Justin

29:03.780 --> 29:05.860
so that it got here ahead of us

29:05.860 --> 29:08.820
so that we could use them as soon as we got here.

29:08.820 --> 29:11.060
Because we don't want to sleep on any other sheets

29:11.060 --> 29:12.340
except Bull and Branch.

29:12.340 --> 29:14.420
We are sponsored this week by Bull and Branch.

29:14.420 --> 29:16.740
Bull and Branch is, they probably make

29:16.740 --> 29:19.460
the most comfortable sheets I've ever slept on.

29:19.460 --> 29:21.700
Maybe when I was like three,

29:21.700 --> 29:24.980
I might've slept on some smurf sheets

29:24.980 --> 29:25.940
that were really great.

29:26.660 --> 29:29.620
But I think Bull and Branch probably tops the list.

29:29.620 --> 29:31.620
Tell me about their product, Travis.

29:32.180 --> 29:32.900
Well, here's the thing.

29:32.900 --> 29:34.900
You know, Griffin, sometimes you go to the store

29:34.900 --> 29:35.700
and you're looking at sheets

29:35.700 --> 29:37.860
and they're so worried about thread count.

29:37.860 --> 29:39.620
Thread count is not as important

29:39.620 --> 29:42.500
as the materials that you put into it.

29:42.500 --> 29:44.660
And, you know, they keep their prices down

29:44.660 --> 29:46.820
because they don't have those like brick and mortar stores

29:46.820 --> 29:47.860
you go to.

29:47.860 --> 29:50.260
So you're going to get like an amazing deal

29:50.260 --> 29:52.900
on the best sheets you've ever slept on.

29:52.900 --> 29:55.060
And you can try it risk-free for 30 nights.

29:55.060 --> 29:56.100
And if you don't love it,

29:56.100 --> 29:57.860
you can send them back for a refund.

29:57.860 --> 29:59.060
But you're going to love it.

29:59.060 --> 29:59.620
They're great.

29:59.620 --> 30:01.060
You have nothing to lose.

30:01.060 --> 30:02.340
And they don't just do sheets.

30:02.340 --> 30:03.540
They do towels.

30:03.540 --> 30:05.060
They do duvets.

30:05.060 --> 30:06.340
They do all kinds of stuff.

30:06.340 --> 30:09.060
We've been using their towels for the last couple of nights.

30:09.060 --> 30:10.820
And one, they're huge,

30:10.820 --> 30:12.660
which is always a good thing in a bath towel.

30:12.660 --> 30:14.500
And two, they're super fluffy and comfortable.

30:14.500 --> 30:15.540
It makes me feel like I'm staying

30:15.540 --> 30:16.980
at the classiest hotel in town.

30:17.940 --> 30:19.060
And if you want to check it out,

30:19.060 --> 30:20.660
you should go to bollandbranch.com.

30:20.660 --> 30:23.860
That's B-O-L-L-N-branch.com.

30:23.860 --> 30:26.020
And they're offering our listeners $50 off

30:26.020 --> 30:27.380
their first set of sheets.

30:27.380 --> 30:29.140
Just go to bollandbranch.com

30:29.140 --> 30:31.940
and use the promo code MYBROTHER, all one word,

30:31.940 --> 30:34.900
and you'll get $50 off your first set of sheets.

30:34.900 --> 30:35.220
Do it.

30:35.220 --> 30:36.020
You'll love it.

30:36.020 --> 30:39.060
Promo code MYBROTHER, all one word, bollandbranch.com.

30:39.060 --> 30:39.540
Go check it out.

30:39.540 --> 30:40.900
I want to tell you about Blue Apron

30:40.900 --> 30:43.300
because I fucking love Blue Apron very, very much.

30:43.300 --> 30:45.860
I'm going to be sad traveling.

30:45.860 --> 30:48.020
And I'll be hanging out with my family for a month

30:48.020 --> 30:49.140
or whatever, and that'll be cool.

30:49.140 --> 30:53.780
But I'll miss Blue Apron because I'm leaving it behind.

30:53.780 --> 30:54.820
Good news, Griffin.

30:54.820 --> 30:56.820
We're going to have Blue Apron at my house.

30:56.820 --> 30:58.100
So come on over.

30:58.100 --> 30:59.140
The cooking's fine.

30:59.140 --> 31:00.900
It's only enough for two portions.

31:00.900 --> 31:02.020
Well, my wife won't eat.

31:03.300 --> 31:04.980
That seems like a bad arrangement to me.

31:04.980 --> 31:05.540
I won't eat.

31:06.260 --> 31:07.700
That seems like a better arrangement to me.

31:07.700 --> 31:10.980
So what Blue Apron does is they'll both just watch you eat.

31:10.980 --> 31:11.460
That sounds great.

31:11.460 --> 31:13.620
And you'll eat a portion fit for a game.

31:13.620 --> 31:14.100
Yay.

31:15.060 --> 31:16.580
So for less than $10 a meal, Blue Apron

31:16.580 --> 31:19.140
delivers seasonal recipes along with pre-portioned ingredients

31:19.140 --> 31:22.260
to make delicious home-cooked meals right

31:22.260 --> 31:23.780
in your very own kitchen.

31:23.780 --> 31:25.060
And it teaches you how to cook.

31:25.060 --> 31:26.740
And you get to make really, really tasty stuff

31:26.740 --> 31:29.380
like paprika-spiced shrimp and cheddar grits

31:29.380 --> 31:32.580
with tomato and sweet corn, spicy hoisin chicken stir fry

31:32.580 --> 31:36.100
with baby bok choy and sesame ginger cucumber salad, eggplant

31:36.100 --> 31:39.700
and chickpea, I don't even know what this word is,

31:39.700 --> 31:46.500
tagine with islander pepper, tomato, and couscous.

31:46.500 --> 31:49.460
So many great, great meals that are so tasty.

31:49.460 --> 31:50.580
I love Blue Apron.

31:50.580 --> 31:53.860
It's kind of changed the way that I eat food.

31:53.860 --> 31:57.620
And it has taught me to cook basically starting from nothing.

31:58.420 --> 32:01.060
And this is, I mean, I guess is another pretty good anecdote.

32:01.060 --> 32:02.020
I'm traveling for a month.

32:02.020 --> 32:04.580
And it's super easy to just pop in and pop out

32:04.580 --> 32:07.700
and cancel the boxes where you're traveling.

32:07.700 --> 32:09.700
And they really don't make a big deal out of it.

32:09.700 --> 32:11.620
It's really easy to get what you want.

32:11.620 --> 32:14.580
And they have different menus for different dietary preferences

32:14.580 --> 32:15.700
and all kinds of good stuff.

32:15.700 --> 32:17.380
So you can get your first three meals for free

32:17.380 --> 32:19.620
with free shipping if you go to blueapron.com

32:19.620 --> 32:20.420
slash my brother.

32:20.420 --> 32:23.460
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

32:23.460 --> 32:25.460
Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

32:25.460 --> 32:29.780
I have two new slogans for both that I've thought up.

32:29.780 --> 32:30.420
OK, great.

32:30.420 --> 32:31.540
OK, you ready?

32:31.540 --> 32:34.820
Bowling branch, holy sheet.

32:34.820 --> 32:36.500
OK, so they have holes in them?

32:36.500 --> 32:37.220
Yeah, that's the first problem.

32:37.220 --> 32:38.980
Well, maybe like holy sheet.

32:38.980 --> 32:39.780
These are great.

32:41.060 --> 32:44.420
And then Blue Apron, just eat it.

32:46.660 --> 32:47.700
Well, you also cook it.

32:47.700 --> 32:48.580
You have to cook it.

32:49.300 --> 32:50.260
Just eat it.

32:50.260 --> 32:50.580
OK.

32:50.580 --> 32:52.020
Because it's both.

32:52.020 --> 32:53.220
OK, get this.

32:53.220 --> 32:56.100
It's both playing off of Nike TMTM.

32:56.100 --> 32:58.900
And also off of the hit Weird Al parody.

32:58.900 --> 32:59.620
Yeah.

32:59.620 --> 32:59.860
Yeah.

32:59.860 --> 33:00.180
Eat it.

33:00.180 --> 33:00.500
Eat it.

33:00.500 --> 33:02.660
Eat it.

33:02.660 --> 33:05.620
And then you can get Weird Al or John

33:05.620 --> 33:08.900
Nike to come in and be your spokesman, Blue Apron,

33:09.460 --> 33:11.140
or them working together.

33:11.140 --> 33:15.140
Travis, I'm glad that you are so invested in our product.

33:15.140 --> 33:17.540
But we really just brought you on here for the tagline stuff.

33:17.540 --> 33:19.780
So if you do actually suggest who

33:19.780 --> 33:21.700
we bring on to market anything from now on,

33:22.340 --> 33:23.860
that may be the end of our arrangement.

33:24.660 --> 33:25.620
I understand.

33:25.620 --> 33:28.340
I'm just so excited to finally get to use my advertising degree.

33:29.460 --> 33:30.100
Thank you.

33:30.100 --> 33:30.660
Thank you so much.

33:30.660 --> 33:32.100
I'm Gregory Blue Apron.

33:32.100 --> 33:33.860
And I need you to leave my office right now.

33:34.580 --> 33:35.620
OK, thank you very much.

33:36.260 --> 33:37.940
I'll let myself just through the door here.

33:38.580 --> 33:39.300
Through the water.

33:39.300 --> 33:40.180
Through the water slide.

33:40.900 --> 33:43.700
Oh, the one that's marked for bad boys?

33:43.700 --> 33:44.420
Yeah, the bad boys slide.

33:44.420 --> 33:48.260
We actually bought the Blake check kids house as our home.

33:48.260 --> 33:51.700
Yeah, so anyway, I have the door for good boys,

33:51.700 --> 33:52.900
but bad boys get wet.

33:52.900 --> 33:53.380
So.

33:53.380 --> 33:54.260
OK, tone low.

33:54.260 --> 33:55.140
No need to shove me.

33:55.140 --> 33:56.020
OK, I'm going.

33:56.020 --> 33:56.500
OK, thank you.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.420
How did you know it was me as Gregory Blue Apron

33:58.420 --> 34:00.820
this whole time?

34:00.820 --> 34:02.020
I knew it was you the whole time.

34:02.020 --> 34:03.940
So look, just trying to take over the Blake.

34:03.940 --> 34:05.300
OK, I'm going down the water slide now.

34:06.340 --> 34:06.840
Bye.

34:08.660 --> 34:13.140
I have a personal message here to read on our program.

34:13.140 --> 34:17.060
And this one comes to us from Ian and Andrew.

34:18.340 --> 34:20.340
And it is for Becca Mason.

34:20.980 --> 34:22.660
And it says, Dr. Reebs.

34:23.220 --> 34:24.900
OK, it's not a good start.

34:24.900 --> 34:26.500
It's not Becca's name.

34:26.500 --> 34:28.740
Congratulations on finishing college.

34:28.740 --> 34:29.860
Only took a decade.

34:30.420 --> 34:32.420
Sorry we couldn't be there to watch it,

34:32.420 --> 34:34.500
but we're all so proud.

34:35.140 --> 34:36.180
Nanu Nanu.

34:37.700 --> 34:38.660
Timely.

34:38.660 --> 34:40.180
Ian and Andrew.

34:40.180 --> 34:40.660
It's forever.

34:40.660 --> 34:42.660
They just started watching Work at Monday.

34:42.660 --> 34:44.260
Alf, Ian and Andrew.

34:45.700 --> 34:49.060
Harry and the Hendersons, the TV show, Ian and Andrew.

34:49.060 --> 34:50.420
Well, you know how Alf would always,

34:50.420 --> 34:52.340
his catchphrase was just he would shout his own name.

34:53.140 --> 34:54.660
I love cats, Alf.

34:54.660 --> 34:55.160
Alf.

34:56.980 --> 35:00.260
He would also quote himself and it doesn't matter.

35:00.260 --> 35:00.980
Congratulations.

35:00.980 --> 35:01.700
It's a bad joke.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.380
Congratulations, Dr. Reebs.

35:03.940 --> 35:04.980
We're very proud of you.

35:05.780 --> 35:07.460
It's a lot of schooling to ingest,

35:07.460 --> 35:09.060
but you've really done it now.

35:09.060 --> 35:11.940
And now no more teachers, no more books or dirty looks.

35:12.500 --> 35:14.180
Time to fucking party.

35:14.180 --> 35:15.620
I want to read the other one too.

35:15.620 --> 35:16.020
OK.

35:16.020 --> 35:16.900
If I could.

35:17.860 --> 35:20.260
It's for Zane and it's from Radja.

35:21.060 --> 35:22.100
And it says this.

35:22.100 --> 35:24.740
Hey, Zane, look behind the couch.

35:26.420 --> 35:28.820
OK, now I suggest that we take this

35:28.820 --> 35:30.820
and do a couple of different readings of it.

35:30.820 --> 35:32.660
Justin, could you give me like?

35:32.660 --> 35:34.340
Yeah, let me try one.

35:34.340 --> 35:35.060
Let me try one.

35:35.060 --> 35:35.560
OK.

35:36.020 --> 35:38.420
Hey, Zane, look behind the couch.

35:38.980 --> 35:41.140
And it's like there's a mummy back.

35:41.140 --> 35:42.100
I think I saw a mummy.

35:42.100 --> 35:42.580
Oh, OK.

35:42.580 --> 35:43.860
Can I try one here?

35:43.860 --> 35:44.360
OK.

35:45.380 --> 35:47.860
Hey, Zane, look behind the couch.

35:48.900 --> 35:51.140
Now, I changed the punctuation a little bit.

35:51.140 --> 35:52.260
I changed the punctuation a little bit there,

35:52.260 --> 35:54.180
but I wanted to add some urgency to it.

35:54.740 --> 35:57.700
As though, like, every time Zane turns around,

35:57.700 --> 35:59.540
the thing behind the couch ducks down

35:59.540 --> 36:00.980
and Zane's like, there's nothing there.

36:00.980 --> 36:02.100
I told you, Radja.

36:02.100 --> 36:03.060
Like, every time.

36:03.060 --> 36:04.500
Sorry, I know I'm going out of order here,

36:04.500 --> 36:06.100
but I would like to just try one more real quick.

36:06.740 --> 36:07.240
OK.

36:07.860 --> 36:10.420
Hey, Zane, look behind the couch.

36:10.420 --> 36:11.540
So that was like Borat.

36:12.740 --> 36:13.700
Nanu nanu.

36:14.420 --> 36:16.740
Nanu nanu, my Zane.

36:17.460 --> 36:18.820
Kind of a Borat thing.

36:18.820 --> 36:19.860
So he did a Borat.

36:19.860 --> 36:23.460
On that one was kind of a Borat voice.

36:24.740 --> 36:26.420
I would love to hear Morgan Freeman

36:26.420 --> 36:29.380
do a Borat joke sometime.

36:29.380 --> 36:29.860
And one of his-

36:29.860 --> 36:35.460
While dancing the dance from Napoleon died in one of his movies.

36:35.460 --> 36:38.100
One thing that I wanted to mention here,

36:38.100 --> 36:41.940
it did say as close to September 3rd as possible.

36:41.940 --> 36:43.620
So let's hope it's not a puppy.

36:46.420 --> 36:48.420
Or a clown that you paid by the hour.

36:48.420 --> 36:50.580
Yeah, because that's going to be expensive and dead.

36:51.780 --> 36:52.660
I'm Jesse Thorne,

36:52.660 --> 36:54.740
and I'm curious about Jonathan Van Ness

36:54.740 --> 36:56.420
and his show, Getting Curious.

36:56.420 --> 36:58.820
What were you most excited to learn something about?

36:58.820 --> 37:00.980
I was really excited about the Romanoffs.

37:00.980 --> 37:02.020
I was really excited-

37:02.020 --> 37:03.380
Why were you so excited about the Romanoffs?

37:03.380 --> 37:04.340
Because I've been obsessed-

37:04.340 --> 37:06.260
thanks for listening to the episode, I'm just kidding.

37:06.260 --> 37:08.900
Because I've been obsessed with them since I was 11

37:08.900 --> 37:10.100
from the movie Anastasia.

37:10.660 --> 37:12.020
Jonathan, what's a baby brain?

37:12.900 --> 37:14.740
It's a brain that's finally ready to explore.

37:15.380 --> 37:17.860
Getting Curious, a show for your baby brain.

37:17.860 --> 37:19.460
Download it wherever you get podcasts.

37:20.900 --> 37:22.660
Tonight, we were at a very nice bar.

37:22.660 --> 37:24.580
And at that bar, we met some very kind people

37:25.140 --> 37:26.660
who we suspect paid our bill.

37:27.220 --> 37:28.740
We're not sure if it was them.

37:28.740 --> 37:29.780
Should we thank them anyway?

37:30.420 --> 37:32.100
What do we do about this mystery bar tab?

37:33.060 --> 37:34.260
What is appropriate to tip?

37:34.980 --> 37:37.300
Do we tip the people who we suspect paid our tab?

37:38.260 --> 37:42.420
What do we tip the bartenders who we do not suspect paid our tab?

37:43.060 --> 37:44.580
That's from Helpless.

37:44.580 --> 37:45.380
I'm Seattle.

37:45.380 --> 37:49.060
I'm not sure they meant that, but let's go with that.

37:49.060 --> 37:51.220
Because I think this is maybe written to us

37:51.220 --> 37:54.900
after a night of, maybe on the night of the bar tab.

37:54.900 --> 37:56.740
But it sounds from the tenor of the email

37:56.740 --> 37:59.380
like it was a considerable night of drinking as well.

37:59.380 --> 38:00.820
Now, I do want to make clear here

38:00.820 --> 38:04.740
because they did not include in the text, like in the body,

38:04.740 --> 38:07.620
but in the subject line that it was their birthday.

38:07.620 --> 38:09.780
It was like after a birthday night out

38:09.780 --> 38:11.380
or something was the subject line.

38:11.380 --> 38:14.180
So they met these people at the bar on their birthday,

38:14.180 --> 38:16.740
their birthday and not just like a random night out at a bar.

38:18.020 --> 38:21.060
Then yeah, they probably paid your birthday tab.

38:21.060 --> 38:21.780
I don't-

38:21.780 --> 38:24.180
Did you just walk out of the bar and think,

38:24.180 --> 38:26.980
I bet they paid our tab because that's so weird.

38:26.980 --> 38:27.940
No one stopped us.

38:27.940 --> 38:28.980
I guess someone paid our tab.

38:28.980 --> 38:30.020
I guess someone paid it.

38:30.020 --> 38:33.540
Well, the bouncer said, have a good night.

38:33.540 --> 38:34.580
I guess we were square.

38:36.500 --> 38:38.820
Okay, I've been in this position before though

38:38.820 --> 38:40.260
where someone was like, oh, you're all set.

38:40.260 --> 38:41.140
You're good to go.

38:41.140 --> 38:43.460
And like, you don't want to question it too much

38:43.460 --> 38:46.980
because like you don't want to like spoil the managing.

38:46.980 --> 38:47.220
Sure.

38:47.220 --> 38:48.020
But at the same time,

38:48.020 --> 38:51.540
like if these like random new friends paid your bar tab,

38:51.540 --> 38:52.500
you want to say thank you.

38:52.500 --> 38:53.860
But if you want like picture,

38:53.860 --> 38:56.100
hey, I just want to say thank you for paying our tab.

38:56.100 --> 38:57.140
We, what?

38:57.140 --> 39:01.220
We, we didn't like that.

39:01.220 --> 39:02.900
I cannot, especially if you're drunk,

39:02.900 --> 39:06.900
I cannot imagine a more awkward like bar interaction

39:06.900 --> 39:08.420
than thanking someone for that.

39:08.420 --> 39:08.740
See, I think-

39:08.740 --> 39:09.780
Well, there's probably worse.

39:09.780 --> 39:11.460
I think you should definitely get to like

39:11.460 --> 39:13.380
the bottom of this situation.

39:13.380 --> 39:14.820
Like you need to know.

39:14.820 --> 39:16.020
It's important that you know.

39:16.020 --> 39:18.660
Otherwise you owe them a life debt.

39:18.660 --> 39:19.620
But some people though,

39:20.500 --> 39:23.940
some people just love lording that shit over you.

39:23.940 --> 39:25.060
Like for some people,

39:25.060 --> 39:28.340
like it is worth the price of paying your bar tab

39:28.340 --> 39:31.380
if they get to sort of immerse you

39:31.380 --> 39:33.620
in a pool of your own confusion.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.900
Oh, is this like one of those like internet,

39:36.900 --> 39:38.740
you know, things that you see on Facebook

39:38.740 --> 39:40.420
where it's like the young couple

39:40.420 --> 39:42.180
and the older couple pays for their meal

39:42.180 --> 39:43.700
and leaves them like a note

39:43.700 --> 39:45.780
that's like when we were a young couple,

39:45.780 --> 39:47.380
we also ate a hamburger

39:47.380 --> 39:48.740
and somebody paid for our hamburger.

39:48.740 --> 39:50.740
So now, so now you are like,

39:50.740 --> 39:54.180
you are burdened with this generosity burden.

39:54.180 --> 39:55.780
Now you have to go to a bar

39:55.780 --> 39:58.180
and meet a rando stranger on their birthday.

39:58.180 --> 39:58.500
I think it's-

39:58.500 --> 40:00.580
And if you don't in seven weeks,

40:00.580 --> 40:01.940
really bad stuff will happen.

40:01.940 --> 40:04.180
Yeah, then the VHS tape explodes

40:04.180 --> 40:05.700
and you, the girl comes out.

40:06.340 --> 40:09.140
I think it's more like just they want to confuse you

40:09.140 --> 40:10.900
and shroud you in mystery

40:10.900 --> 40:13.540
and just know that that torment is worth it.

40:13.540 --> 40:15.700
Dad kind of did me dirty like this yesterday

40:15.700 --> 40:18.100
because we all left Max Fun Con East yesterday

40:18.100 --> 40:19.780
and Rachel and I had like three hours to kill

40:19.780 --> 40:20.660
before our flight.

40:20.660 --> 40:22.500
And so we went to this outlet mall

40:23.140 --> 40:25.380
and dad texted us as we were on our way

40:25.380 --> 40:27.780
back to the airport from the outlet mall.

40:27.780 --> 40:28.820
And he was like,

40:28.820 --> 40:30.820
did Rachel find anything at the outlet mall?

40:30.820 --> 40:32.340
And I was like, what the fuck?

40:33.140 --> 40:33.780
What the fuck?

40:33.780 --> 40:35.620
Like, how do you, how would you know that?

40:35.620 --> 40:37.380
Like, why are you, how would you know that?

40:37.380 --> 40:38.340
Were you at the outlet mall

40:38.340 --> 40:39.860
just like creeping on you, you didn't say?

40:39.860 --> 40:43.940
Turns out that he used Travis's phone

40:43.940 --> 40:46.420
because we have the like find my friend feature

40:46.420 --> 40:47.860
turned on for each other

40:47.860 --> 40:50.580
and just kind of scoped my scene out through the phone

40:51.700 --> 40:53.460
and then like just let me know

40:53.460 --> 40:55.700
that he knew exactly where I was at that moment.

40:55.700 --> 40:58.740
And I said, well, that's not creepy at all.

40:58.740 --> 41:00.500
And really, I'm just bringing this up

41:00.500 --> 41:02.500
because boys, we need to have a talk about

41:03.220 --> 41:07.060
why, when is right to use the feature

41:07.060 --> 41:09.540
of tracking the fucking geolocational position

41:09.540 --> 41:10.260
of my brothers.

41:10.260 --> 41:12.260
I use, Griffin, I used it to know

41:12.260 --> 41:14.420
that Justin in the eight hour drive up

41:14.420 --> 41:15.940
stopped at two different sheets.

41:17.460 --> 41:19.380
That's what I used it for.

41:19.380 --> 41:23.060
That tells me that there was a sort of ongoing surveillance

41:23.060 --> 41:24.260
of Justin's whereabouts happening.

41:24.260 --> 41:26.100
Yeah, you can't set a notification,

41:26.100 --> 41:28.180
like alert me when he stops at a sheet.

41:29.380 --> 41:30.340
Hey phone?

41:30.340 --> 41:31.060
Siri.

41:31.060 --> 41:32.100
Siri, please let me know

41:32.100 --> 41:33.860
anytime Justin checks out a sheet.

41:33.860 --> 41:36.420
That would require like more or less constant marketing.

41:36.420 --> 41:38.420
Like, did you have a lab in the back seat?

41:40.020 --> 41:42.420
I had the boys down in the lab working on it.

41:43.460 --> 41:45.860
This is only to be used if I end up

41:45.860 --> 41:47.540
in somebody's cellar somewhere.

41:48.260 --> 41:50.340
Not if you're just fucking bored

41:50.340 --> 41:52.900
and you wanna see if I'm at J.Crew, okay?

41:54.580 --> 41:56.500
I'll fucking remove, if it happens again,

41:56.500 --> 41:57.780
I'll remove it from my phone

41:57.780 --> 41:59.700
because this is a huge invasion of privacy.

41:59.700 --> 42:02.420
I was at J.Crew and I was buying some slacks for the show.

42:02.420 --> 42:04.420
I was buying my show slacks there, there.

42:04.420 --> 42:07.380
It actually popped up as a notification actually

42:07.380 --> 42:08.900
that you were buying show slacks.

42:08.900 --> 42:10.900
It's strangely specific.

42:10.900 --> 42:12.740
It let me know that Justin was getting

42:12.740 --> 42:16.340
a double chocolate bar and a cheer wine

42:16.340 --> 42:18.180
and that Griffin was buying show slacks.

42:19.300 --> 42:20.740
I hate every second of this.

42:21.620 --> 42:23.380
Please don't creep on my loc.

42:23.380 --> 42:26.580
I have had the actual thought before.

42:27.780 --> 42:29.140
Another night at home, huh guys?

42:29.140 --> 42:30.660
You guys should really get out there more.

42:30.660 --> 42:31.780
I'm gonna text them and tell them

42:31.780 --> 42:33.220
they should go out somewhere

42:33.220 --> 42:35.940
because I'm tracking you.

42:35.940 --> 42:37.700
I'm just curious how you're doing sometimes.

42:38.660 --> 42:39.220
How are you doing?

42:39.220 --> 42:39.860
What are you up to?

42:40.660 --> 42:42.420
Actually, I'm feeding my phone through.

42:43.380 --> 42:45.700
I've got a backup secret phone.

42:45.700 --> 42:49.140
I've got a shadow proxy that's bouncing off in Belarus.

42:49.140 --> 42:50.580
Griffin's in Belarus, cool.

42:51.460 --> 42:52.820
Belarus again, huh Griffin?

42:52.820 --> 42:55.460
Wow, you sure get over there a lot.

42:55.460 --> 42:56.500
Do you guys wanna Yahoo?

42:56.500 --> 42:57.060
Yes, please.

42:57.060 --> 42:57.460
Yes.

42:57.460 --> 43:00.900
I just wanna send him by Morgan Davey.

43:00.900 --> 43:03.380
Keep it wavy, Morgan Davey.

43:03.380 --> 43:03.940
It's pretty good.

43:04.580 --> 43:06.180
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

43:06.180 --> 43:07.140
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

43:07.140 --> 43:08.100
I'm gonna call them.

43:09.940 --> 43:11.780
Burger Man asks,

43:13.860 --> 43:15.620
what is the meaning of the,

43:16.180 --> 43:17.540
oh man, sorry.

43:17.540 --> 43:21.940
What is the meaning of The Gambler by Kenny Rogers?

43:22.820 --> 43:23.940
God, man, you tell me.

43:23.940 --> 43:26.500
I heard the song on the way home from dinner last night.

43:26.500 --> 43:29.060
We all argued on what the song was really written about.

43:29.060 --> 43:30.740
I would like to know your views.

43:30.740 --> 43:33.060
I personally think it's about women.

43:33.060 --> 43:35.300
My son believes it's about poker.

43:35.300 --> 43:37.540
My wife says it's about life.

43:37.540 --> 43:39.140
My son is very literal.

43:39.140 --> 43:41.140
My wife says it's about life.

43:41.140 --> 43:42.740
I can find anyone on the web

43:42.740 --> 43:45.380
where people have debated this topic, okay?

43:45.380 --> 43:47.220
Little known fact, it's about origami.

43:47.220 --> 43:49.940
Maybe y'all can help me, thanks CB.

43:49.940 --> 43:53.460
So I guess this is by Charles Bradshaw.

43:55.540 --> 43:56.980
What do you guys think it's about?

43:56.980 --> 43:59.220
Well, here's the thing.

43:59.220 --> 44:01.220
A lot of people read too much into this.

44:01.220 --> 44:03.460
I think I'm gonna go with The Sun

44:03.460 --> 44:05.940
and I think it's just like a song

44:05.940 --> 44:08.420
all about high level poker strategies.

44:08.420 --> 44:10.020
Well, I tell you, here's the thing.

44:10.020 --> 44:11.860
I think you're right on one level,

44:11.860 --> 44:14.180
but on another level, it's also about a song

44:14.180 --> 44:16.180
where someone dies in the middle of the song.

44:17.860 --> 44:20.500
And very often that portion of the song

44:20.500 --> 44:22.180
is kind of glazed over,

44:22.180 --> 44:24.580
but there's a death in the middle of this song

44:24.580 --> 44:26.660
that everyone sings all the time.

44:26.660 --> 44:28.740
Okay, here's what happens to the gambler.

44:28.740 --> 44:31.140
If you're looking for the little story of the gambler,

44:31.140 --> 44:32.500
there's two men on a train.

44:32.500 --> 44:34.260
One man looks at the other man and says,

44:34.260 --> 44:36.820
hey, you're looking pretty rough and run down.

44:36.820 --> 44:38.100
Like you don't look great.

44:38.100 --> 44:41.140
But if you give me some whiskey,

44:41.860 --> 44:43.940
I will give you the answers

44:43.940 --> 44:45.860
that will help turn this around for you.

44:45.860 --> 44:48.100
And he's like, okay, here's some whiskey.

44:48.100 --> 44:50.900
So he drinks some whiskey and he says,

44:51.460 --> 44:53.220
play poker well.

44:53.220 --> 44:58.020
Well, every hand can win, every hand can lose.

44:58.020 --> 44:59.540
And the best that you can hope for

44:59.540 --> 45:00.900
is to die in your sleep.

45:00.900 --> 45:04.820
And then as if like, and he's like winks

45:04.820 --> 45:06.260
and then he dies in his sleep.

45:06.260 --> 45:10.660
He's like, I know it was the most object lesson

45:10.660 --> 45:12.900
any teacher has ever taught.

45:12.900 --> 45:15.700
Watch, the best you can go for is dying in your sleep.

45:15.700 --> 45:18.580
Like this, watch me do it.

45:18.580 --> 45:20.180
Allow me to demonstrate.

45:20.180 --> 45:22.500
And then there's a sequel called The Gambler 2,

45:22.500 --> 45:24.820
which is like, can I get some help in here?

45:24.820 --> 45:27.460
There's a dead old man in this drink.

45:27.460 --> 45:28.660
There's a dead old man here.

45:29.380 --> 45:31.060
I gave him the wrong bottle.

45:31.060 --> 45:31.700
So let me give you-

45:31.700 --> 45:34.900
I forgot I had this pin cleaner with me.

45:34.900 --> 45:36.900
So let me get this straight, tough guy.

45:36.900 --> 45:38.420
You're sitting there with the man.

45:38.420 --> 45:41.220
The last thing he ever does is drink from a bottle

45:41.220 --> 45:44.100
you gave him and then he just dies.

45:44.100 --> 45:45.220
Just like that.

45:45.220 --> 45:47.300
Right after he says you should die in your sleep,

45:47.300 --> 45:48.500
he dies in his sleep.

45:48.500 --> 45:50.660
You really expect us to believe that?

45:50.660 --> 45:51.220
You're going to jail.

45:51.220 --> 45:53.860
Listen, you gotta believe me, it was a beautiful moment.

45:53.860 --> 45:56.420
And he told me that you got no one to hold them

45:56.420 --> 45:57.700
and no one to fold them.

45:57.700 --> 46:00.420
And I think he was talking about more than poker.

46:01.140 --> 46:02.100
And then he died.

46:02.100 --> 46:03.540
And then he died in his sleep.

46:04.260 --> 46:06.260
But I still had to get to Philadelphia.

46:06.260 --> 46:09.060
So we sat on that train for a while longer.

46:09.060 --> 46:12.020
Because you can't just like stop a train at a hospital.

46:12.020 --> 46:15.540
How asleep does an old man have to be

46:15.540 --> 46:18.100
if he drifts off mid metaphor?

46:18.100 --> 46:19.860
And it's just like, I'm gonna-

46:19.860 --> 46:22.980
Like how long are you in that car before you're like,

46:22.980 --> 46:24.820
I'm going to check this stranger's pulse.

46:25.380 --> 46:27.300
This has got, like, this has got-

46:27.300 --> 46:29.220
Excuse me, is there more?

46:29.940 --> 46:31.380
I gave you a taste of my whiskey.

46:31.380 --> 46:34.100
Excuse me, is there more to your advice?

46:34.100 --> 46:36.340
The best that I could hope for is die in my sleep.

46:36.340 --> 46:38.020
Fuck you, old man.

46:38.020 --> 46:40.100
What about like, you know, being happy

46:40.100 --> 46:41.700
and like making friends and shit?

46:41.700 --> 46:44.420
The old man like wake back up and be like,

46:44.420 --> 46:46.100
just kidding, follow your dreams.

46:46.100 --> 46:48.260
One more thing, just one more thing.

46:48.260 --> 46:49.460
Sorry, I almost forgot.

46:49.460 --> 46:51.140
What I meant, when I said die in your sleep,

46:51.140 --> 46:53.460
what I meant was wake up and have a great breakfast

46:53.460 --> 46:54.820
and maybe face a new day.

46:54.820 --> 46:57.780
And one other thing, try to keep your money

46:57.780 --> 47:02.180
in low risk mutual funds for, you know, as long-

47:02.180 --> 47:02.900
And leave them in there

47:02.900 --> 47:04.660
because you're just gonna get hit with interest.

47:04.660 --> 47:06.500
But also do die in your sleep.

47:06.500 --> 47:06.820
Bye.

47:07.940 --> 47:09.540
Tell your friends and family you love them

47:09.540 --> 47:10.740
as often as you can.

47:10.740 --> 47:12.420
And just remember like, you know,

47:12.420 --> 47:13.780
every day is an opportunity.

47:13.780 --> 47:16.900
And also like, die in your sleep, fuck us.

47:16.900 --> 47:17.400
Yes.

47:19.140 --> 47:20.420
Listen, all of this is-

47:20.420 --> 47:21.940
Hey, old man, are you okay?

47:23.300 --> 47:25.540
Hey, I know you were talking about I seem rundown.

47:25.540 --> 47:26.820
I'm now worried about you.

47:26.820 --> 47:27.620
Are you all right?

47:28.260 --> 47:30.500
Because all you want is my booze and to die.

47:30.500 --> 47:31.300
Are you okay?

47:31.300 --> 47:32.100
Listen, are you cool?

47:32.100 --> 47:32.600
Yeah.

47:32.900 --> 47:36.180
Listen, son, I can see you're having a rough time.

47:36.180 --> 47:37.940
I've got things all figured out.

47:37.940 --> 47:39.140
Let me see if I can help.

47:41.060 --> 47:44.500
Do poker good or do poker bad.

47:44.500 --> 47:47.140
Either way, die in your sleep.

47:47.140 --> 47:47.640
Bye.

47:48.500 --> 47:49.140
Okay, bye.

47:50.580 --> 47:52.500
You can have whatever is in my bags.

47:53.060 --> 47:53.560
Bye.

47:54.500 --> 47:55.700
My life is your life now.

47:55.700 --> 47:57.220
What is that taste of your whiskey?

47:57.220 --> 47:59.380
Did this old man just up in the bottle?

47:59.380 --> 48:01.780
I'm gonna kill myself with whiskey now.

48:01.780 --> 48:02.180
Good night.

48:02.180 --> 48:02.820
Okay, bye.

48:02.820 --> 48:05.700
Or the whiskey was poisoned.

48:05.700 --> 48:08.340
This song is a song about killing a gambler.

48:10.900 --> 48:14.340
And then I realized that I was the greatest gambler

48:14.340 --> 48:16.180
because the old greatest gambler died

48:16.180 --> 48:18.100
and now I was the best gambler.

48:20.020 --> 48:21.860
Then I felt the quickening

48:21.860 --> 48:24.100
and his gambling skill jumped into me

48:24.100 --> 48:26.260
because this is the way that gambler works.

48:26.260 --> 48:27.940
No one will ever admit it.

48:29.940 --> 48:32.100
I'm wearing all his rings

48:32.100 --> 48:33.780
and I stole his identity.

48:34.500 --> 48:35.460
I couldn't make that fit.

48:36.660 --> 48:40.100
This has been the plot to Now You See Me 3.

48:40.100 --> 48:45.300
Fuck, fuck.

48:45.300 --> 48:48.500
Listen, all of this happens in the song The Gambler

48:49.140 --> 48:54.180
but it's all really lessons about being good at poker

48:54.180 --> 48:55.780
because not a lot of people know this

48:56.500 --> 48:59.060
but most of Kenny Rogers songs

48:59.780 --> 49:03.620
are just kind of walkthroughs for various games.

49:04.580 --> 49:07.060
So he has that one called Ocarina of Time

49:07.060 --> 49:07.540
and it's like,

49:07.540 --> 49:11.460
gotta go to Kakariko Village and race against Dom Peh.

49:12.100 --> 49:15.540
Get yourself the hook shot to get in the Forest Temple.

49:16.420 --> 49:20.260
Don't ever keep a knight on the side of the board.

49:20.260 --> 49:23.940
They're much better pieces when they're active in the center.

49:25.060 --> 49:28.580
That's actually, I was watching the World Series of Poker once

49:28.580 --> 49:29.940
and Phil Mickelson was down

49:29.940 --> 49:31.780
and everybody's like, whoa, what's he gonna do?

49:31.780 --> 49:33.620
Like, he's clearly beat

49:33.620 --> 49:36.500
and they'd already gone all in, turned the cards over

49:36.500 --> 49:38.900
and he died in his sleep and won automatically.

49:40.260 --> 49:42.580
I'm like, and everybody was blown away

49:42.580 --> 49:44.180
because they'd never seen that maneuver before

49:44.180 --> 49:45.860
and then they checked his lock event

49:45.860 --> 49:47.780
and he was just listening to The Gambler on repeat

49:47.780 --> 49:49.460
and they're like, holy shit, he's a genius.

49:49.460 --> 49:50.500
That's sort of a weird through line

49:50.500 --> 49:51.780
through all of Mr. Rogers songs.

49:51.780 --> 49:56.900
It's like, scoop up the fish, go to Jabu Jabu, die in your sleep.

49:56.900 --> 50:00.340
Wait, why do I, I was just about to get the spiritual stone of water.

50:00.340 --> 50:02.420
This is a prostrat run through.

50:02.420 --> 50:06.660
If you're trying to get a hundred percent, also you gotta die in your sleep.

50:06.660 --> 50:08.340
Wait, hold on, I just can't.

50:08.340 --> 50:10.260
When you knocked the painting over

50:10.260 --> 50:13.220
to the other people in 13 Dead End Drive,

50:13.220 --> 50:16.580
then you go to sleep and you die and then everybody died.

50:18.180 --> 50:22.180
And Nathan and his brother, they're searching for the treasure.

50:22.180 --> 50:25.460
You gotta jump on the cliff and then you die in your sleep.

50:25.460 --> 50:26.260
Wait, hold on.

50:26.260 --> 50:30.100
Level up Chie Sadonaka until she learns bufu.

50:30.100 --> 50:32.900
Use it in boss fights, die in your sleep.

50:38.500 --> 50:40.820
That's just when he gets stuck in the game.

50:42.100 --> 50:43.780
I don't know what to do next.

50:43.780 --> 50:44.900
It's gotta be a glitch.

50:45.860 --> 50:47.300
Maybe die in your sleep.

50:51.540 --> 50:54.740
I mean, you will have finished the game in a very literal sense.

50:55.780 --> 50:58.420
You only made it to level two of Crash Bandicoot.

50:58.420 --> 50:59.940
What are you talking about?

50:59.940 --> 51:03.620
Yeah, but like sometimes the big giant thing rolls against you

51:03.620 --> 51:06.580
and the best thing you can hope for is to die in your sleep.

51:06.580 --> 51:09.780
Other people have beat Crash Bandicoot, Kenny Rogers.

51:09.780 --> 51:11.940
Sometimes the guru's gonna get ya,

51:11.940 --> 51:14.900
but you check the mailbox earlier and then die in your sleep.

51:14.900 --> 51:17.140
You made it 30 seconds so far.

51:18.980 --> 51:20.820
You go west and then you go north.

51:22.820 --> 51:26.660
Use key on door and if that doesn't work, you die in your sleep.

51:26.660 --> 51:28.820
Make the note, come on, we just started Zork.

51:28.820 --> 51:32.100
Make the bricks line up and make them disappear.

51:32.100 --> 51:34.100
Oops, you got a stack going.

51:34.100 --> 51:35.060
Die in your sleep.

51:39.620 --> 51:41.620
This has been our show, My Brother, My Brother, Me.

51:41.620 --> 51:48.020
We hope you've enjoyed yourself for this very cinema heavy episode,

51:48.020 --> 51:51.780
kind of a cinema theme, cinnabon of an episode.

51:52.420 --> 51:57.540
We wanted to mention we are doing a fundraiser

51:57.540 --> 52:02.340
that has been so wonderfully successful for another show,

52:03.620 --> 52:04.420
The Adventure Zone.

52:04.420 --> 52:05.780
We're not actually doing it.

52:05.780 --> 52:08.260
We gave our blessing to this wonderful project.

52:08.260 --> 52:09.620
It's called The Adventure Zine.

52:10.260 --> 52:12.660
If you go to theadventurezine.com,

52:12.660 --> 52:17.060
you can pre-order an art book that has so many incredible artists.

52:17.620 --> 52:19.860
These artists and the organizers of this project

52:19.860 --> 52:24.820
through their generosity have raised over $90,000 for this project.

52:24.820 --> 52:26.420
Jesus, that's insane.

52:26.420 --> 52:29.220
It's 306% of the goal.

52:29.220 --> 52:35.540
All the profits from the book are gonna go to the Facing Hunger Food Bank,

52:35.540 --> 52:39.940
which is a food bank here in the Huntington, West Virginia tri-state area.

52:40.660 --> 52:44.020
So we're hugely excited about this project.

52:44.020 --> 52:46.260
Again, it's not our baby.

52:46.260 --> 52:51.140
We've put a laughable amount of work into making this successful,

52:51.140 --> 52:54.900
but a lot of really good hardworking people are doing just that.

52:54.900 --> 52:56.180
We're extremely appreciative.

52:56.180 --> 52:59.860
So theadventurezine.com, go pre-order that.

52:59.860 --> 53:03.220
I'm not actually sure how long the campaign goes.

53:03.220 --> 53:05.860
Do you guys have any idea how long they're gonna be accepting?

53:05.860 --> 53:08.740
No, but just assume it ends tomorrow and go do it now.

53:08.740 --> 53:09.460
What are you waiting on?

53:10.500 --> 53:14.740
They've been kind of slowly leaking out some of the previews of the art.

53:14.740 --> 53:15.380
It's fucking great.

53:15.380 --> 53:16.420
It's gonna be stunning.

53:17.220 --> 53:18.020
A couple of things.

53:18.020 --> 53:20.580
I wanna say, as long as we're talking about people putting in a lot of hard work

53:20.580 --> 53:21.380
to make something awesome,

53:21.380 --> 53:24.580
we just got back from Max Funke East,

53:24.580 --> 53:26.580
and it was incredible.

53:26.580 --> 53:27.780
Not only was it a great time,

53:28.740 --> 53:30.660
all the attendees were wonderful.

53:30.660 --> 53:32.020
We did an Adventure Zone,

53:32.020 --> 53:33.860
and a bunch of people showed up in cosplay,

53:33.860 --> 53:37.140
and it was very wonderful and warmed our tiny black hearts.

53:37.140 --> 53:41.140
We're gonna be publishing that Adventure Zone this winter sometime,

53:41.140 --> 53:42.820
once Travis and I have the babies,

53:42.820 --> 53:44.820
and are gonna take some time off from...

53:44.820 --> 53:46.180
We need to figure out, by the way, boys,

53:46.180 --> 53:47.860
what we're doing with my bim-bam during that period.

53:48.660 --> 53:51.540
Unless we start gonna crank them out, but I don't know.

53:51.540 --> 53:52.660
I mean, last time we...

53:52.660 --> 53:53.780
Please let us know.

53:53.780 --> 53:57.220
Last time we had a parental leave was just when you left,

53:57.220 --> 53:59.460
and that's when we fucking launched Adventure Zone.

53:59.460 --> 54:00.340
Can you believe that shit?

54:00.340 --> 54:01.700
Who knows what's coming out now?

54:01.700 --> 54:04.900
Yeah, who knows what podcast we're gonna start while Travis and I are gone.

54:04.900 --> 54:05.940
That's how we do it.

54:05.940 --> 54:08.660
We have babies, and we take some time off,

54:08.660 --> 54:09.620
and during that time off,

54:09.620 --> 54:14.020
we give ourselves a lot more obligations for when we come back.

54:14.020 --> 54:16.180
I think we should just do a full episode of Smart Stuff.

54:16.180 --> 54:17.300
I think that's what we should release.

54:17.300 --> 54:19.780
That would be so good, but that's just you and Roman.

54:20.340 --> 54:21.220
Yeah, just me and Roman.

54:21.220 --> 54:22.740
That way you guys could do your own thing,

54:22.740 --> 54:25.300
and Roman and I, Roman, if you're listening to this,

54:25.300 --> 54:28.020
get at me, Justin at teengoogle.com.

54:28.020 --> 54:31.460
You also know how to DM me and shit, but let's do this, Roman.

54:32.740 --> 54:35.220
Speaking of more obligation, we also, this week,

54:35.220 --> 54:38.020
are going to start working, like really working,

54:38.020 --> 54:42.740
full boiler into the My Brother, My Brother and Me TV show.

54:42.740 --> 54:43.220
Yes.

54:43.220 --> 54:46.660
So we will try to remain on a regular release schedule, but if we-

54:46.660 --> 54:47.860
No, we will.

54:47.860 --> 54:52.020
We are working with somebody who's going to help us edit

54:52.020 --> 54:53.460
and get the podcast up.

54:53.460 --> 54:56.500
The, I think the result for you, the end result for you, the user,

54:56.500 --> 54:58.420
I think the Bim Bams are probably going to go up

54:58.420 --> 55:01.860
a little bit later on Mondays than you're used to.

55:01.860 --> 55:03.060
Probably not Monday mornings,

55:03.700 --> 55:06.900
probably closer to like Monday afternoon, maybe even evening,

55:07.460 --> 55:12.180
depending on like how crazy things are for us that any given day,

55:12.180 --> 55:13.940
but that'll just be for a few weeks

55:14.500 --> 55:16.100
and then things will calm down again.

55:16.100 --> 55:18.340
But yeah, just bear with us.

55:18.340 --> 55:20.740
We are so fucking excited to make this TV show.

55:20.740 --> 55:23.940
Like it has gotten to a point where like,

55:24.660 --> 55:27.140
I was so scared to make a TV show

55:27.140 --> 55:30.260
because we never do like on camera stuff ever.

55:30.260 --> 55:32.420
And all of that has just been replaced with excitement

55:32.420 --> 55:37.380
because the ideas for the show are just like so good, y'all.

55:37.380 --> 55:38.900
It's going to be so, so good.

55:39.540 --> 55:41.220
And if you keep an eye on like our Twitter

55:41.220 --> 55:42.340
and the Facebook group and stuff,

55:42.340 --> 55:43.540
we'll post some pictures from the set.

55:43.540 --> 55:44.820
Do you know CISO now?

55:44.820 --> 55:45.700
That's where it's going to be.

55:45.700 --> 55:50.660
CISO is like a TV comedy subscription service from NBC.

55:50.660 --> 55:52.580
With a bunch of like original programs.

55:52.580 --> 55:54.420
There's also like stuff like Saturday Night Live

55:54.420 --> 55:55.620
and Kids in the Hall is all on there.

55:55.620 --> 55:57.780
But there's original shows that people are putting together.

55:57.780 --> 56:00.180
You got to watch Take My Wife on CISO.

56:00.180 --> 56:03.140
It's Cameron Esposito and Rhea Butcher's show.

56:03.140 --> 56:04.660
It's fucking phenomenal.

56:04.660 --> 56:06.580
So like go get on it now and watch that

56:06.580 --> 56:09.380
and then watch our show when it comes out early next year.

56:10.740 --> 56:11.860
So one last thing.

56:11.860 --> 56:13.140
We're doing a Candle Night show.

56:13.140 --> 56:14.820
In case you missed the announcement last week,

56:14.820 --> 56:16.180
tickets are currently on sale.

56:16.180 --> 56:20.100
As of yesterday, there were like a hundred left or something.

56:20.820 --> 56:22.020
So don't wait.

56:22.020 --> 56:24.180
September 30th in Huntington, West Virginia.

56:24.180 --> 56:26.580
And we're going to be filming maybe not the whole thing,

56:26.580 --> 56:29.860
but like clips and bits for the TV show.

56:29.860 --> 56:30.900
So it's going to be-

56:30.900 --> 56:31.700
Some of our best poofs.

56:31.700 --> 56:35.460
Some of our best poofs and goofs and all the bloofs.

56:35.460 --> 56:36.740
It's going to be great.

56:36.740 --> 56:39.300
So it's going to be an extra special Candle Night special.

56:39.300 --> 56:39.800
Yeah.

56:40.660 --> 56:42.500
September 30th in Huntington.

56:42.500 --> 56:48.020
In Huntington, you can go to CandleNights2016.bpt,

56:48.020 --> 56:51.460
brown paper tickets, bpt.me.

56:51.460 --> 56:52.180
Get the tickets now.

56:52.180 --> 56:53.220
Come down, hang out with us.

56:53.220 --> 56:54.420
And it's not just my brother and my brother and me.

56:54.420 --> 56:55.780
It's going to be my brother and my brother and me,

56:55.780 --> 56:58.260
Sawbones, Schmaners, and still Buff Rags.

56:58.260 --> 56:58.980
So- The whole set.

56:58.980 --> 57:01.380
It's going to be really huge for 20 bucks.

57:01.380 --> 57:04.180
It's actually 21 because $1 from every sale

57:04.180 --> 57:07.300
is going to Branch's domestic violence shelter

57:07.300 --> 57:08.580
here in Huntington.

57:08.580 --> 57:10.100
So you're buying a ticket and you're

57:10.100 --> 57:10.980
doing a little bit of good.

57:10.980 --> 57:13.140
You can come down to the show and hang out with us.

57:13.140 --> 57:13.860
All right.

57:13.860 --> 57:15.300
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

57:15.300 --> 57:16.660
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure.

57:16.660 --> 57:18.020
Off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

57:18.020 --> 57:19.460
Thanks to Maximum Fun for having us.

57:19.460 --> 57:21.140

Final Yahoo.

57:29.300 --> 57:33.540
This one was sent in by Seymour Funk.

57:33.540 --> 57:35.300
And I don't know if that's a real name or not, gang.

57:36.260 --> 57:38.100
But I want it to be so badly.

57:38.100 --> 57:41.300
There's a fun progressive ad at the top of the screen with flow

57:41.300 --> 57:43.620
and she's poking her head in like, hey, what's up?

57:43.620 --> 57:44.420
OK.

57:44.420 --> 57:45.220
All right.

57:45.220 --> 57:47.700
It's from Yahoo Answers user, Beemore, who asks,

57:50.260 --> 57:51.380
is it soup weather yet?

57:54.900 --> 57:56.180
And he was just a McElroy.

57:56.180 --> 57:57.140
I'm Travis McElroy.

57:57.140 --> 57:57.940
I'm Griffin McElroy.

57:57.940 --> 57:59.220
This has been my brother, my brother.

57:59.220 --> 58:00.660
I mean, kiss your dad's square on the lips.

58:00.660 --> 58:19.380
Hey, girls, do you want to say, hey, I want to?

58:19.380 --> 58:21.300
