WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.360 --> 00:16.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:16.000 --> 00:30.880
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.880 --> 00:37.440
We're now gonna be around, if you got no place to go when you're feeling down.

00:39.360 --> 00:45.760
If you're all alone, when the pretty birds are calling. Could it really be? Could it be a week

00:45.760 --> 00:53.680
has passed already? You've lived, laughed, loved, learned, loomed for seven days, and now you are

00:53.680 --> 01:01.040
back for all our loving embrace. We did a bit of eating, did a bit of praying, and did some loving.

01:01.040 --> 01:07.120
Yeah. Now a week has passed, the Earth has spun on its axis seven times. You have a new set of

01:07.120 --> 01:12.880
problems. New problems. And a new set of skin cells. New skin cells. You shed the old ones,

01:12.880 --> 01:19.520
now it's time to shed the chains, time to shed the yoke of your burdens, and put that shit right on

01:19.520 --> 01:25.840
us, Annie. It's funny because your skin cells today have never heard of my brother, my brother,

01:25.840 --> 01:31.520
me. You're a whole new person. Every time you listen to In My Boom Bam, it's your skin's first

01:31.520 --> 01:38.880
time. Yeah, your skin, your new skin, may not like it. If so, are bad. Yeah, it's like the,

01:38.880 --> 01:44.720
how the new Doctor Who doesn't like black people. Exactly. Yeah, have you not seen it? It's a really

01:44.720 --> 01:50.640
super racist. It got real weird. It's a weird direction they're taking. He actually just goes

01:50.640 --> 01:55.920
back in time to stop like equal rights and everything. It's really weird. It's pretty

01:55.920 --> 02:01.680
inappropriate actually. Yeah, but God, compelling. It's so good. The writing's so good. The writing,

02:01.680 --> 02:08.640
you can't. I like his albino companion. Yeah. He's the widest bird on the board. Crikey.

02:10.240 --> 02:13.280
Crikey? That's what they say, right, Doctor Who? Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's what they say.

02:13.280 --> 02:19.440
And shag. So let's help some people. This is, of course, My Brother, My Brother and Me. It's an

02:19.440 --> 02:26.960
advice show for the modern era and now wisdom. Ian from Gmail writes, he says, my brother wants

02:26.960 --> 02:34.880
to name his first born child Anakin. Stop. No, no, you can't stop because Ian feels compelled to tell

02:34.880 --> 02:40.640
us after the Star Wars character. Thank you, Ian. Thank you so much. Oh, not Anakin Jones,

02:40.640 --> 02:44.960
the political leader. It may surprise you to learn that I'm the type of person who's never

02:44.960 --> 02:51.040
seen a Star Wars movie before. Is that the one about the missile defense system in the 1970s?

02:51.040 --> 02:57.280
Yeah, correct. Is it a documentary? While I'm mildly amused by this, I fear it could wind up

02:57.280 --> 03:03.200
in the same vein as having the middle name Danger. What should I do to convince him otherwise? Or

03:03.200 --> 03:10.800
should he learn from his own mistakes? Yeah. Yeah. Hey, he's not he's not the one who has to. It's

03:11.920 --> 03:16.560
your brother. Well, live and learn. I regret your brother will never look back 18 years from now

03:16.560 --> 03:22.080
and be like, man, that was a bad move. Really? Should I never name that kid Anakin? I regret

03:22.080 --> 03:26.960
that. He's not going to know that my kids been beaten to death. Yeah, he's not going to be the

03:26.960 --> 03:32.960
one that hangs himself in his closet when he's 10 years old. Yeah, that that's not a good name.

03:32.960 --> 03:36.880
You could maybe use this as an opportunity to turn him on to my brother. My brother and me

03:37.680 --> 03:44.320
hit podcast and we could just sort of tell him like, don't do that. Maybe Luke go with Luke.

03:45.440 --> 03:52.000
It's a fine normal person name. Yeah. Jar Jar Binks. The problem with Anakin and Jar Jar Binks

03:52.000 --> 03:58.480
is that you are saying there is no room for equivocation. Like it is named after the character

03:58.480 --> 04:03.520
in Star Wars. It's not maybe I had a friend a couple of years ago and she said, my first daughter,

04:03.520 --> 04:08.240
I'm going to name Hermione. It's like, no, you don't at all want to do that. You never

04:09.040 --> 04:15.280
want to name your kid anything that's that recognizably nerdy. Like, this is my son, Kal-El.

04:15.280 --> 04:21.040
Sorry, Nicholas Cage. But you just want to keep that to yourself. Have that be a personal thing

04:21.040 --> 04:27.120
in your heart that you don't saddle on your poor unborn fetus. Maybe Anakin could be like a nickname

04:27.120 --> 04:33.680
and and now and you can call that to yourself. No, still not that maybe a middle name.

04:34.720 --> 04:41.280
Why don't you name your son Lightsaber? How about Podracer? This is my son X-Wing.

04:41.280 --> 04:43.600
Hi, have you met my boy Wizard? He's wizard.

04:46.400 --> 04:51.200
Oh my God, you guys, I cannot believe we didn't talk about this already.

04:51.200 --> 04:59.120
Why don't you name your son David Hasselhoff? Whoa, there it is. We got the official seal

04:59.120 --> 05:05.680
of approval from Mr. David Hasselhoff on Twitter. I think I want to go ahead and say we're his

05:05.680 --> 05:13.760
official source for life advice, but it's really recent. We haven't been guiding every step he's

05:13.760 --> 05:18.640
made. We're working hard now. There are probably a few bad decisions that we could have steered

05:18.640 --> 05:23.520
him away from, like the whole the whole drunken eating a burger on the floor with his shirt on.

05:23.520 --> 05:27.840
I do that. I do that. I ain't judging him. Yeah, but you don't do that on video on the

05:27.840 --> 05:33.360
internet. Have you ever tried to convince a drunk person to not eat a hamburger?

05:35.520 --> 05:39.520
I don't care how good our show is. It's not gonna happen. Hey, don't eat that.

05:39.520 --> 05:43.360
It's like convincing Doctor Who not to hate black people. Exactly.

05:43.360 --> 05:51.280
But all joking aside, I know he's a fan of the show. I mean, why else? Why else would he be

05:51.280 --> 05:57.760
following us? I know he's a fan of the show. And so, David, just thank you for God damn it. Thank

05:57.760 --> 06:03.680
you for everything. Thank you for your performances on the television programs that you've been on.

06:03.680 --> 06:08.080
Thank you for Knight Rider. Thank you for bringing down the Berlin Wall single handedly. That's

06:08.080 --> 06:12.720
probably the most important contribution that you've done. I was talking to some friends and

06:12.720 --> 06:17.760
the first thing I did when I found out was contact everyone I've ever known in my life and say,

06:17.760 --> 06:22.880
hey, look at this thing I've done. But I finally put it in context of why it was so amazing. And

06:22.880 --> 06:27.840
I said, if I had a time machine and I could go back in time five years and tell five years

06:27.840 --> 06:32.480
younger Travis that in five years he was going to do something that David Hasselhoff not only listened

06:32.480 --> 06:37.360
to, but enjoyed, there is no way I would ever believe that. It's just the greatest thing that's

06:37.360 --> 06:41.680
ever happened to me. And I've done some pretty awesome things in my life. Just to reiterate,

06:41.680 --> 06:46.400
he definitely, definitely listens. Definitely 100% chance that he listens.

06:48.000 --> 06:53.920
The forecast is 100% chance of my brother, my brother, me precipitation in David Hasselhoff's

06:53.920 --> 06:57.920
ear holes. Definitely, definitely no room for equivocation there. So thanks, Hoff.

06:57.920 --> 07:02.560
What was that show where he played a car, where he transformed into a car?

07:02.560 --> 07:03.520
That would be-

07:05.200 --> 07:06.240
Fight Rider.

07:06.240 --> 07:07.680
Knight Rider.

07:07.680 --> 07:08.240
Knight Rider.

07:08.240 --> 07:09.280
Knight Rider?

07:09.280 --> 07:13.760
Only he was the driver of the car. It was Mr. Feeny that was the one that transformed into the

07:13.760 --> 07:14.160
car.

07:14.160 --> 07:18.560
Mr. Feeny was like a friend of his and he transformed into a car when things got

07:18.560 --> 07:20.160
hot. When he was eating hot food.

07:20.160 --> 07:25.680
Mr. Feeny was a friend of his and then was killed by a car and his soul inhabited the car.

07:25.680 --> 07:27.200
Got eaten by the car.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.840
Yeah, that was that. It's a great show. Check it out.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.200
No, you're thinking of the movie Click.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.720
The Hoff is a tremendous performance in that.

07:36.720 --> 07:36.960
Yeah.

07:36.960 --> 07:38.320
In the future.

07:38.320 --> 07:43.360
So Lucas writes us, again, Hoff, thank you because you're definitely listening.

07:43.360 --> 07:46.720
So I just started college and my roommates are friends of mine from high school.

07:46.720 --> 07:50.480
My problem is I realized I'm almost nothing like them.

07:51.840 --> 07:55.680
I'm even kind of wondering how I became friends with them in the first place.

07:55.680 --> 07:57.920
They think things I like are stupid.

07:57.920 --> 08:03.200
They don't understand my positions and opinions on things and often call things I like gay.

08:03.200 --> 08:06.240
They often play it off by saying they're just messing around, but it's so often that I'm

08:06.240 --> 08:07.120
really getting sick of it.

08:07.680 --> 08:11.120
What do I do? Lucas, they sound terrible, dude.

08:11.120 --> 08:13.520
They sound like the worst.

08:13.520 --> 08:17.440
This is an object lesson in the difference between high school friends and college friends.

08:18.640 --> 08:23.200
Now that you have grown up a little bit and realized that you don't have anything in common

08:23.200 --> 08:28.000
with these people, that's a common problem in that transition.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.440
It's time to get out of that friendship.

08:31.440 --> 08:36.400
Yeah, we can we I mean, maybe this stuff, Lucas slice is just gay.

08:37.920 --> 08:41.120
Maybe dude reads like comic books and gay shit like that.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.160
Like, yeah.

08:42.160 --> 08:44.640
Maybe you do it a bunch of gay shit, Lucas.

08:44.640 --> 08:46.320
You read anime.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.920
You read anime, Lucas.

08:48.800 --> 08:52.960
Maybe like just put put away your childish things.

08:52.960 --> 08:53.920
Go hit up the gym.

08:55.120 --> 08:57.200
Just go hit up the gym with your boys.

08:57.200 --> 09:00.160
Like maybe maybe you're the one with the problem, not them.

09:00.160 --> 09:04.720
Um, maybe you should stop hanging full size posters of yourself having sex with men.

09:04.720 --> 09:04.960
Yeah.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.120
Well, this is art.

09:07.120 --> 09:08.320
And in other people's room.

09:09.360 --> 09:10.880
This is an intervention.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.240
Put down the Twilight books.

09:12.880 --> 09:13.600
Get out there.

09:13.600 --> 09:14.320
Meet some ladies.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.960
Now the guy, Lucas, these guys sound like a nightmare.

09:16.960 --> 09:19.680
Yeah, you will find other people that you like.

09:19.680 --> 09:23.920
And even if you like, even if you have to walk the world alone, like that guy in

09:23.920 --> 09:28.720
Kung Fu, like you don't have to deal with people calling things you like gay.

09:28.720 --> 09:30.480
Nobody has the right to do that.

09:30.480 --> 09:35.360
Now, the other side of that coin, though, is if they're your roommates, you've probably

09:35.360 --> 09:38.000
signed a lease or have a dorm with them.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.360
So what you want to do is avoid them as much as possible.

09:41.360 --> 09:42.160
Like, no joke.

09:43.120 --> 09:46.640
Just because they're your roommates, you don't have to hang out with them.

09:46.640 --> 09:50.400
Find some new friends and just try to see them as little as possible.

09:50.400 --> 09:51.280
You're in college, right?

09:51.840 --> 09:54.480
Dude, there's no sense in you getting bullied anymore.

09:54.480 --> 09:55.600
It's not happening.

09:55.600 --> 10:01.760
You, right, go hang out with other people, sleep in your room, just muscle through it.

10:01.760 --> 10:04.000
But don't deal with these pricks.

10:04.000 --> 10:04.560
They sound like they suck.

10:04.560 --> 10:08.720
The only reason that you became friends with them in the first place is because high school

10:08.720 --> 10:09.440
is like prison.

10:11.040 --> 10:15.280
If you don't get into a group, you'll get stabbed on the playground or whatever.

10:15.280 --> 10:15.520
Yeah.

10:15.520 --> 10:18.560
The next time they said they're just playing it off, just tell them fuck off.

10:18.560 --> 10:19.280
You know what I mean?

10:19.280 --> 10:20.400
Yeah, yeah.

10:20.400 --> 10:21.840
You don't need their explanations.

10:21.840 --> 10:23.920
Just tell them to get the fuck out.

10:23.920 --> 10:24.400
You know what?

10:24.400 --> 10:26.400
Go back to those prison rules.

10:26.400 --> 10:27.200
Shiv one.

10:27.200 --> 10:27.440
Yeah.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.360
Yeah, see who's gay now.

10:30.480 --> 10:30.960
You know what?

10:33.280 --> 10:36.160
Shiv him and then have sex with the Shiv wood and say, yeah, you're right.

10:36.160 --> 10:36.720
This is gay.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.240
This is pretty gay what I'm doing to you right now.

10:38.240 --> 10:39.280
You're pretty fucking gay.

10:39.280 --> 10:40.640
And you're also dead.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.280
And you're dead.

10:41.840 --> 10:42.800
How's your dead corpse?

10:42.800 --> 10:43.760
I'm in jail now.

10:43.760 --> 10:46.000
And ironically, I'm in prison for that.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.920
Or I'm making the best friends of my entire life.

10:47.920 --> 10:50.400
I'm making the best friends for having such a good time.

10:50.400 --> 10:54.480
Me and tiny love are going to fucking kill you.

10:54.480 --> 10:55.200
Hey, hey.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.320
Tiny love and I are getting out.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.320
I have a Yahoo answer question.

11:00.320 --> 11:01.760
It was sent in by Dilbob.

11:01.760 --> 11:02.640
Thank you, Dilbob.

11:04.160 --> 11:07.440
It's from Yahoo answers user Desmond Hume.

11:07.440 --> 11:08.160
Oh, how nice.

11:08.720 --> 11:13.520
So as you can imagine, a Yahoo answer question named after the philosopher and lost character

11:13.520 --> 11:18.240
Desmond Hume is going to be very, very well thought out.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.800
And why are my ears never dirty?

11:23.920 --> 11:26.640
I'm 17 and my ears are never dirty.

11:26.640 --> 11:27.920
I never have to clean them.

11:27.920 --> 11:28.880
I try.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.000
Nothing comes out.

11:30.000 --> 11:30.500
Why?

11:32.720 --> 11:34.400
Worst superpower ever.

11:35.680 --> 11:39.680
That was actually the first answer is you have a supernatural power where your ears never get

11:39.680 --> 11:40.000
dirty.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.120
Rare, but extravagant.

11:41.120 --> 11:41.440
Lucky.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.880
I like that he clarifies that he's 17.

11:44.880 --> 11:45.360
Yeah.

11:45.360 --> 11:47.600
Well, I mean, that's part of puberty, right?

11:47.600 --> 11:52.800
Your ears really don't start producing that man wax until, you know, 2021.

11:52.800 --> 11:53.300
Yeah.

11:54.080 --> 11:56.320
Market a product called man wax.

11:56.320 --> 12:00.640
Are you telling me that in the year 2021, my ears are going to start producing man wax?

12:00.640 --> 12:01.140
Yeah.

12:02.640 --> 12:03.360
Everybody.

12:03.360 --> 12:07.520
That's when we're going to have the dyslexic apocalypse and just the wax is just going

12:07.520 --> 12:08.720
to be flowing.

12:08.720 --> 12:09.220
Yeah.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.680
At the same time, though, I know what he's talking about.

12:13.680 --> 12:19.200
Like there are those days where you just get a Q-tip up in there and you try and, you know,

12:19.200 --> 12:21.840
get some relief and then nothing happens.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.640
And that's a heartbreaking experience.

12:24.640 --> 12:29.120
I picture him like standing at the bathroom sink, just gripping the counter and staring

12:29.120 --> 12:33.360
at himself in the mirror and saying, today's the day and slowly bringing a Q-tip up to

12:33.360 --> 12:34.560
his ear and then nothing.

12:34.560 --> 12:35.520
Like maybe that's a thing.

12:35.520 --> 12:41.680
Like maybe that's like pubes used to be for young dudes and I guess periods used to be

12:41.680 --> 12:42.560
for young ladies.

12:42.560 --> 12:45.280
Like all my friends have got their wax already.

12:46.000 --> 12:46.720
Yeah.

12:46.720 --> 12:48.080
When will I get the wax?

12:48.080 --> 12:49.600
When will I get the wax?

12:49.600 --> 12:53.200
Oh, youngling, the waxing happens when you're most ready.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.520
We do not choose the time of all waxing.

12:55.520 --> 12:59.040
I can't show my face at school anymore until I get some wax.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.880
Everyone knows how clean my ears are.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.040
The guys say, the guys say there's Jimmy clean ears.

13:05.600 --> 13:08.960
When we're in the locker room, they're all poking fun in my ears.

13:08.960 --> 13:12.720
They're all in homeroom just picking away at their sweet lax ears.

13:12.720 --> 13:14.640
I'm just sitting there looking like a jackass.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.160
Like a chump.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.000
Oh, I can't get any wax.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.640
I got all mine out already this morning.

13:20.640 --> 13:21.600
I save them in a jar.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.400
I'll show you someday.

13:22.400 --> 13:23.120
I'll bring it in.

13:23.120 --> 13:23.680
I promise.

13:23.680 --> 13:26.960
Dear mama, dear mama, when will I get the wax?

13:27.600 --> 13:29.040
Soon, my baby.

13:29.040 --> 13:29.920
Soon.

13:29.920 --> 13:31.680
You know, you should never use Q-tips.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.600
Don't give me that shit.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.960
You're poking your brain.

13:34.960 --> 13:37.760
I'll use anything that has a long line.

13:37.760 --> 13:39.280
You should rinse your ear.

13:39.280 --> 13:42.000
You should rinse your ears every day with warm water.

13:42.720 --> 13:47.760
Is it troubling that my left ear when I use the Q-tip, it immediately makes me cough.

13:50.560 --> 13:51.440
That's a problem.

13:51.440 --> 13:53.280
Yeah, that's a definite problem.

13:53.280 --> 13:55.120
I think you've got an impaction of some sort.

13:55.120 --> 13:55.360
Great.

13:57.680 --> 14:01.120
I've just started this wonderful relationship with an amazing girl I met through Dungeons

14:01.120 --> 14:02.320
and Dragons tabletop.

14:02.320 --> 14:04.000
Don't ever let her go.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.280
The problem is I've never been in a serious relationship before.

14:07.280 --> 14:11.040
I don't know when or how to display the appropriate signs of affection.

14:11.040 --> 14:13.840
Hugging, kissing, holding hands, please help.

14:13.840 --> 14:14.800
Et cetera.

14:14.800 --> 14:15.440
Et cetera.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.680
Please help as soon as possible.

14:19.200 --> 14:20.720
Dating and dragons, Gmail.

14:20.720 --> 14:22.000
Okay, first off, yes.

14:22.960 --> 14:26.240
Secondly, it sounds like you got the basics down.

14:27.840 --> 14:29.280
It goes hug, kiss, hold a hand.

14:30.240 --> 14:31.600
Hug, hug me.

14:31.600 --> 14:32.480
Et cetera.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.240
All right, let's be delicate here.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.040
Okay.

14:37.040 --> 14:41.920
Because this sounds like for a serious relationship, it sounds like you need some advice.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.280
All right, let's get serious.

14:43.280 --> 14:49.840
Here's what's tricky about this dating and dragons is it differs for every relationship.

14:50.720 --> 14:54.800
Or sometimes you've got to have that slow crawl to the top where you start with holding

14:54.800 --> 15:05.680
hands and then awkward hug and then a kiss and then a little bit of hanky panky, which

15:05.680 --> 15:09.600
is the scientific term for it, and then full on hanky panky.

15:11.360 --> 15:17.360
Some relationships, some relationships you just got to jump right into the hanky panky

15:17.360 --> 15:19.280
and then work your way backwards from there.

15:19.280 --> 15:22.240
Like relationships with prostitutes, like pretty woman, did you see?

15:23.920 --> 15:31.920
Yeah, hand holding is a good sort of all purpose thing, but it says to the world like, hey,

15:31.920 --> 15:35.680
hey, we are dating and this is my property.

15:35.680 --> 15:44.000
You should also announce loudly several intervals, my property eyes off and in all seriousness,

15:44.000 --> 15:46.880
don't display affection at the game.

15:47.760 --> 15:53.680
Your friends will kill your girlfriend off and then you'll have this awkward situation

15:53.680 --> 15:55.680
where, you know, do you leave the game?

15:56.720 --> 16:00.400
Here's what you're going to want to do when you're sitting on the couch and it's a romantic

16:00.400 --> 16:05.440
time, a loving time, if you will, you're going to make eye contact and then you're

16:05.440 --> 16:06.800
going to roll a perception check.

16:09.920 --> 16:14.400
Travis, I know I do what I can.

16:14.400 --> 16:15.520
It's the little things.

16:15.520 --> 16:22.960
It's it's, you know, affection doesn't have to be in the in the physical ways that

16:22.960 --> 16:25.680
everybody thinks it's whatever feels right for you.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.920
It's it's mainly about showing that you're considerate.

16:27.920 --> 16:32.560
So, you know, if you know she's had a hard day, you make dinner.

16:32.560 --> 16:37.040
If she forgot to get her retainer, you go get it for her.

16:37.760 --> 16:41.440
If she needs help hanging up her cloak, that's another thing you could do.

16:42.320 --> 16:43.920
Maybe polishing her bo staff.

16:45.120 --> 16:48.560
You guys are making jokes, but I think that there's an angle to this question we haven't

16:48.560 --> 16:54.400
considered yet, which is girls that play Dungeons and Dragons are fucking freaks, yo.

16:54.400 --> 16:58.160
Freak? Crazy, crazy, yo.

16:58.160 --> 17:00.480
Lady in the streets, but a freak in the bed.

17:00.480 --> 17:02.560
She may ask, what?

17:02.560 --> 17:03.060
What?

17:03.920 --> 17:09.680
Lady in the caverns, but a freak in the bed roll.

17:11.840 --> 17:18.720
I'm saying I'm saying she's probably so shy, but see in her secret heart of hearts.

17:19.440 --> 17:21.280
She ain't wearing anything underneath that cloak.

17:21.280 --> 17:24.000
She, she is ready.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.080
You need to storm her castle.

17:28.080 --> 17:30.880
A Chastity Belt's got a rip top on it, you know what's up.

17:32.160 --> 17:33.920
Breakaway Chastity Belt, more like.

17:35.200 --> 17:41.920
All right, let's get five more Dungeons and Dragons theme sexual innuendos in.

17:41.920 --> 17:42.880
I'm actually cached.

17:42.880 --> 17:43.600
Are you tapped out?

17:43.600 --> 17:44.480
I'm all out.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.520
That was it, yeah.

17:46.400 --> 17:50.320
Dear brothers, what is the best way to pick up what?

17:50.320 --> 17:51.840
Wait, hold on before we move on.

17:51.840 --> 17:54.720
Did, do we fully answer dating and dragons question?

17:54.720 --> 17:56.480
It's about what you feel comfortable with.

17:56.480 --> 18:01.600
And here's the thing, as far as moving to new levels of signs of affection.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.600
You gotta have enough experience first.

18:03.600 --> 18:10.160
If you wait to be a hundred percent sure that it's time, you will always be waiting.

18:10.160 --> 18:16.400
Sometimes you just got to sack up and, you know, move forward and initiative.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.160
She's a girl that plays Dungeons and Dragons.

18:18.160 --> 18:19.120
She's, she's ready.

18:19.120 --> 18:20.720
Yeah, she's DTP.

18:20.720 --> 18:21.440
She's down to party.

18:22.880 --> 18:25.920
Dear brothers, what is the best way to pick up ladies at a library?

18:26.480 --> 18:33.200
I'm a college student as opposed to a homeless man.

18:33.200 --> 18:38.640
I just, I take my showers at the library bathroom sink.

18:38.640 --> 18:42.800
And I've been thinking about homeless dude.

18:42.800 --> 18:45.600
And I think you have a couple of options.

18:45.600 --> 18:51.200
Um, you could follow her around, follow a lady around, uh, and as she picks up books,

18:51.200 --> 18:52.720
just go, yeah, I read that one.

18:53.920 --> 18:54.560
That one's great.

18:54.560 --> 18:55.680
He dies in the end.

18:56.640 --> 18:58.080
I mean, you don't even have to have read the books.

18:58.800 --> 19:01.520
I mean, you probably won't have read these books.

19:01.520 --> 19:05.760
So don't, don't follow up with, with any questions she might ask about the book.

19:05.760 --> 19:09.840
Just, you know, say every single, I mean, every single book that she picks up, tell

19:09.840 --> 19:10.640
her that you've read it.

19:10.640 --> 19:16.320
Um, also books are heavy, which is something you have to keep in mind, which offers up

19:16.320 --> 19:17.120
a couple of options.

19:17.120 --> 19:21.840
One, you just carry around a bunch of really heavy books and it makes you look so, so strong

19:21.840 --> 19:22.400
and smart.

19:23.760 --> 19:26.000
Or you could offer to carry her books for her.

19:26.720 --> 19:34.400
What I, what my jam used to be, my, my, my old game was, uh, I'd go to the library and,

19:34.400 --> 19:43.920
uh, I'd look in the section of the library where, where all the books are about home

19:43.920 --> 19:45.360
remedies for penis reduction.

19:45.920 --> 19:50.640
And then just, just stand there with your hands on your hips and just keep saying nothing.

19:50.640 --> 19:52.240
There's nothing that works.

19:52.240 --> 19:54.320
What's the Dewey Decimal Code for that section?

19:54.320 --> 19:55.040
Do you remember that?

19:56.800 --> 19:57.440
B-I-G.

19:59.120 --> 19:59.600
Hey, good.

20:00.480 --> 20:02.240
I don't know the Dewey Decimal System.

20:02.240 --> 20:05.840
Who knows the fucking Dewey Decimal System?

20:05.840 --> 20:07.040
Big penis time.

20:07.040 --> 20:07.680
I don't know.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.040
What is the Dewey Decimal System?

20:09.040 --> 20:09.680
How does that work?

20:10.480 --> 20:14.560
In case you're thinking of sending in a question about the Dewey Decimal System and asking

20:14.560 --> 20:16.720
our advice, we're not going to be able to help you out on that.

20:16.720 --> 20:18.640
This is not the place to come.

20:18.640 --> 20:19.440
I've been-

20:19.440 --> 20:21.840
If you want Library of Congress, I got that.

20:21.840 --> 20:24.960
Yeah, he's got that on lockdown, on LOC down.

20:26.800 --> 20:29.120
I've been considering learning to play the guitar.

20:29.120 --> 20:33.200
My stepdad has a guitar and would be able to teach me, but I'm not sure if I'd be willing

20:33.200 --> 20:34.800
to stick with the lessons and practice.

20:35.360 --> 20:38.400
Is it worth it how to learn to play the guitar for casual playing?

20:39.040 --> 20:40.320
Joey from Gmail.

20:40.320 --> 20:42.240
Joe, yes.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.440
Absolutely.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.360
Absolutely.

20:46.480 --> 20:54.240
Get on that now and get ready for the, let's say, wave of female attention.

20:54.240 --> 20:56.240
The deluge of trim.

20:56.240 --> 20:59.920
No, sir, no.

20:59.920 --> 21:00.720
We talked about it.

21:00.720 --> 21:01.840
No dice.

21:01.840 --> 21:02.560
No.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.880
Up to your neck in trim.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.560
No, we talked about this at the meeting.

21:07.280 --> 21:08.240
We covered this.

21:08.240 --> 21:09.920
Yeah, we went over this.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.520
Yeah, playing guitar is great.

21:14.000 --> 21:19.920
I think probably Griffin and I could both be described as hobbyist guitar players.

21:19.920 --> 21:23.120
It's nice to have something that you just do for you and you're not-

21:23.120 --> 21:26.160
You're not, you know, trying to make a living at.

21:26.160 --> 21:28.640
It's just a great way to impress your grandmother.

21:28.640 --> 21:29.760
You think it's a hobby for me?

21:30.480 --> 21:31.520
Oh, is it your life?

21:32.320 --> 21:35.920
I mean, I would say I'm in the business of strumming.

21:35.920 --> 21:36.720
Yeah.

21:36.720 --> 21:38.240
Strumming for trim.

21:38.240 --> 21:39.040
No.

21:39.040 --> 21:41.120
No, no, no.

21:42.640 --> 21:44.000
I think it's a great idea.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.600
I don't think the guitar is as hard to play as some people make it out to be.

21:47.600 --> 21:48.640
It's nice.

21:48.640 --> 21:52.560
I mean, if you play other instruments, especially, it's pretty easy to play.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.160
It's particularly easy to learn.

21:55.440 --> 22:00.720
I went from piano to guitar and I mean, all the basics, you know, chords and stuff.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.160
That all transfers over.

22:02.160 --> 22:07.600
The good thing about the guitar is you can really be to a point where you can play a song

22:08.320 --> 22:09.760
in your first day.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.280
And that's really rewarding.

22:11.280 --> 22:17.920
Like once you're there to already have that sort of instant gratification and, you know,

22:17.920 --> 22:22.480
from there, you can, it's not tough to stick with it because it is.

22:22.480 --> 22:24.160
I mean, I enjoy it a lot.

22:24.160 --> 22:31.760
And again, as Griffin, I'm sure we'll point out a couple more times, is great for wooing women,

22:32.960 --> 22:34.880
ladies or dudes, if that's a thing.

22:34.880 --> 22:41.360
As the non guitar playing McElroy, my only advice in this situation is when you do start

22:41.360 --> 22:45.920
to learn and you do learn to play the guitar, choose your moments to play it carefully.

22:45.920 --> 22:47.040
Here's a great moment too.

22:47.040 --> 22:47.920
Sit on the quad.

22:48.480 --> 22:48.720
Yeah.

22:48.720 --> 22:54.320
A great moment is never don't be that douchebag who like goes to a party and sees a guitar

22:54.320 --> 22:55.520
and is like, oh, I got this.

23:00.560 --> 23:03.200
Joey, just ask yourself, do you want to end up like Travis?

23:03.200 --> 23:05.440
Because if not, pick it up.

23:05.440 --> 23:07.520
Because that's the only thing that separates us from him.

23:07.520 --> 23:08.240
But look out.

23:08.240 --> 23:08.720
That is true.

23:09.280 --> 23:12.800
Can I also recommend maybe considering other instruments as well?

23:12.800 --> 23:13.840
The piano is great.

23:13.840 --> 23:15.120
The sousaphone.

23:15.120 --> 23:19.440
The piano is great, but it's hard to get that Triem because like you can only play it when

23:19.440 --> 23:21.360
there is a piano nearby.

23:21.360 --> 23:23.600
A guitar is like a portable.

23:23.600 --> 23:25.120
It's like a Triem gun.

23:25.120 --> 23:28.240
A guitar is basically a portable piano is what we're saying.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.520
Or a keytar.

23:29.520 --> 23:30.480
A keytar.

23:30.480 --> 23:31.280
Yeah.

23:31.280 --> 23:32.240
No, what?

23:32.240 --> 23:32.960
No.

23:32.960 --> 23:34.640
No, that would be a terrible choice.

23:34.640 --> 23:35.840
I'm trying to bring it back.

23:35.840 --> 23:38.960
Why isn't anyone getting on board with the keytar revolution?

23:38.960 --> 23:42.080
The important thing about the guitar and Griffin did touch on it.

23:42.080 --> 23:43.520
We just can't hammer him enough.

23:43.520 --> 23:46.080
The proper time to play your guitar publicly is never.

23:46.880 --> 23:47.840
Never play it.

23:47.840 --> 23:54.560
You play it at home to get good and then once a month you rack up the courage to go play

23:54.560 --> 23:55.600
an open mic night.

23:55.600 --> 24:00.240
And that's when you get the attention because that's an appropriate acceptable venue for

24:00.240 --> 24:00.720
you to do that.

24:00.720 --> 24:02.240
They expect you to do that.

24:02.240 --> 24:03.600
When they say, where's your guitar?

24:04.160 --> 24:07.200
You have to look at them confused and say, oh, I was under the impression that I should

24:07.200 --> 24:08.640
never play my guitar publicly.

24:10.160 --> 24:11.600
Unless you're really, really good.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.040
Or physically attractive.

24:13.040 --> 24:13.840
No, not even then.

24:13.840 --> 24:14.560
Sounds good.

24:15.120 --> 24:15.600
Yeah.

24:15.600 --> 24:17.200
Nobody wants to hear it at the party.

24:17.200 --> 24:18.080
Trust me.

24:18.080 --> 24:21.280
Unless everybody's drinking and there's a campfire, maybe.

24:21.280 --> 24:25.760
And even then it's going to be like, there'll be three guys who kind of know how to play

24:25.760 --> 24:28.160
and you'll see them like get the jitters with their hands.

24:28.160 --> 24:32.320
Like they just want to get their hands on it and just drop sweet home.

24:32.320 --> 24:34.640
They just want to drop sweet home so hard.

24:34.640 --> 24:38.480
And the formula that you should always keep in mind is for every one person that appreciates

24:38.480 --> 24:42.000
you playing, there are 10 people that wish you were dead.

24:42.000 --> 24:42.160
Yeah.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.560
Is that a trade off you're willing to make?

24:44.560 --> 24:46.160
It depends on who the one person is.

24:46.160 --> 24:49.920
Another important thing that you have to keep in mind when you start playing guitar is what

24:49.920 --> 24:55.200
songs you're going to choose to learn first that are going to be like your go to songs.

24:55.200 --> 25:00.640
Because Joey, you are going to be tempted to just get on that Damien Rice train and

25:00.640 --> 25:02.080
ride it to Trium Town.

25:02.080 --> 25:03.600
But you can't do it.

25:03.600 --> 25:04.800
You can't do it, Joey.

25:04.800 --> 25:05.600
You should do.

25:05.600 --> 25:08.400
You've got to do it a couple of times a month, but no more.

25:09.520 --> 25:11.680
How would you avoid being in a wedding?

25:13.600 --> 25:19.520
A friend of ours is about to propose to his awful girlfriend.

25:20.160 --> 25:21.360
No one likes her.

25:21.360 --> 25:22.800
I suspect he doesn't.

25:22.800 --> 25:27.920
And she is rude and a supreme girly girl.

25:27.920 --> 25:32.320
The women in our group of friends are worried this girl is going to ask us to be her bridesmaids.

25:32.320 --> 25:36.560
We're sure our husband's boyfriends will be groomsmen, and we suspect she doesn't have

25:36.560 --> 25:37.440
other friends.

25:37.440 --> 25:42.080
This means dress shopping, wearing the dress she picks out, and a nightmare bachelorette

25:42.080 --> 25:42.560
party.

25:42.560 --> 25:45.440
So how would you avoid it?

25:45.440 --> 25:46.080
Thanks.

25:46.080 --> 25:48.000
Signed, I'm so not your friend.

25:49.280 --> 25:49.920
Gmail.

25:49.920 --> 25:51.040
OK, all right.

25:52.800 --> 25:55.440
This is going to be hard for you.

25:55.440 --> 25:56.480
I'm so not your friend.

25:56.480 --> 26:04.240
And but sometimes when things are really important to us, we got we have to make sacrifices.

26:04.240 --> 26:10.880
And so you're going to have to sacrifice your friendship with this guy and not go to

26:10.880 --> 26:11.680
his wedding.

26:11.680 --> 26:16.560
Yeah, you've got to come up with something better than the wedding that enlist in the

26:16.560 --> 26:19.120
army and enlist in the army, anything.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.720
But because here's the thing, like.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.800
He's basically dead now.

26:24.800 --> 26:25.920
Like, he's dead now.

26:25.920 --> 26:30.480
You don't have him as a friend anymore because he married like the worst person and you don't

26:30.480 --> 26:31.600
want to spend time with her.

26:32.160 --> 26:34.560
So he's he's not around anymore.

26:35.120 --> 26:35.680
He's gone.

26:36.400 --> 26:39.040
Get used to saying, hey, do you guys remember James?

26:40.000 --> 26:41.200
Whatever happened to James?

26:41.200 --> 26:41.680
What do you mean?

26:41.680 --> 26:42.400
I was at his wedding.

26:42.400 --> 26:43.280
Oh, I was not.

26:43.280 --> 26:44.160
I was not there.

26:44.160 --> 26:45.200
Was it a lovely time?

26:45.200 --> 26:47.840
No, it was awful because his girlfriend is a terrible person.

26:47.840 --> 26:48.560
Oh, great.

26:48.560 --> 26:49.920
I'm glad I didn't go.

26:49.920 --> 26:50.800
I'm sorry he died.

26:50.800 --> 26:51.520
What do you mean?

26:51.520 --> 26:52.240
I don't understand.

26:53.360 --> 26:54.000
Counterpoint.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.360
Uh oh.

26:55.360 --> 26:56.880
Let's go to the fucking wedding.

26:56.880 --> 26:57.840
Go to the wedding.

26:57.840 --> 26:59.520
It's like one day out of your life.

26:59.520 --> 27:00.240
No, but it's not.

27:00.240 --> 27:01.040
No, it's not.

27:01.040 --> 27:02.800
It's not he has to participate.

27:02.800 --> 27:03.680
She has to participate.

27:03.680 --> 27:04.560
She has to participate.

27:04.560 --> 27:07.760
OK, but how do you avoid being in a wedding, not going to a wedding?

27:07.760 --> 27:10.960
Everybody can go to a wedding being in the wedding.

27:10.960 --> 27:11.280
Maybe.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
No, you should be in the wedding and then sabotage the fuck out of it.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.200
Sabotage.

27:17.200 --> 27:17.440
What?

27:18.240 --> 27:19.200
Yes, I love it.

27:19.760 --> 27:21.600
Yes, we're going to tear this wedding apart.

27:21.600 --> 27:25.040
You guys are writing a Jennifer Lopez movie and you don't even realize it.

27:26.000 --> 27:26.720
Yes, I do.

27:26.720 --> 27:27.120
You can't.

27:27.120 --> 27:29.200
I've been working on it for two years.

27:29.200 --> 27:31.680
You can't be faking that every time.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.840
They're like, hey, we're going dress shopping.

27:33.840 --> 27:34.560
Oh, I can't.

27:34.560 --> 27:36.080
Someone died.

27:36.080 --> 27:36.800
I have to go.

27:36.800 --> 27:39.840
I have to go see their body or hey.

27:39.840 --> 27:40.640
Don't fake it.

27:40.640 --> 27:41.040
Go on.

27:42.320 --> 27:43.520
Bachelorette party tonight.

27:43.520 --> 27:46.400
I can't that someone else is dead now.

27:46.400 --> 27:50.880
No, well, you know, you once you have the one excuse for not going to the wedding,

27:50.880 --> 27:53.840
I'm pretty sure they won't keep asking you to go dress shopping.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.560
And so I expect someone to be dead on your wedding day.

27:57.280 --> 27:58.560
That's I'm allergic to love.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.880
I think you make me too happy to be in your wedding.

28:02.880 --> 28:03.760
I can't do it.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.760
I think you should be supportive of your friend.

28:05.760 --> 28:11.360
And I think that maybe you should get to know this this girlfriend slash future wife.

28:12.480 --> 28:16.480
What if she was like, what if she's had a hard life and that's why she's so hard,

28:16.480 --> 28:18.160
a hard exterior inside.

28:18.160 --> 28:20.480
She's like a tootsie roll pop right inside.

28:20.480 --> 28:24.080
She's just breaking that shell, break through the candy shell.

28:25.280 --> 28:28.320
Yeah, I mean, realistically, you should just suck it up.

28:28.320 --> 28:29.680
It's not it'll suck.

28:29.680 --> 28:35.760
But, you know, sometimes as you get older, I think bad experiences are just as valuable

28:35.760 --> 28:38.160
as good experiences, as long as they stick with you.

28:38.160 --> 28:41.520
Because, you know, realistically, it might suck that day, but the next day it'll be funny

28:41.520 --> 28:44.560
and you'll be glad that you still preserve that friendship.

28:44.560 --> 28:47.280
And this relationship will probably self-destruct.

28:47.280 --> 28:50.480
So, you know, say that to her on the wedding day.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.000
Yeah, don't do that.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.920
Yahoo Answers, every Yahoo answer.

28:53.920 --> 28:54.800
Can I drop it?

28:54.800 --> 28:57.440
I was about to ask you personally to drop that.

28:57.440 --> 28:59.200
Chris Depew sent this one in.

28:59.920 --> 29:00.960
Thank you, Chris Depew.

29:01.760 --> 29:05.840
It's from Yahoo Answers user Prashant Kapra.

29:06.640 --> 29:08.960
Wait, hold on.

29:08.960 --> 29:11.040
My whole day is about this person's name now.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.880
Could you please read it one more time?

29:12.880 --> 29:14.800
Prashant Kapra.

29:14.800 --> 29:16.800
Kapra.

29:16.800 --> 29:18.320
Please spell the first name.

29:18.320 --> 29:23.280
P-R-A-S-H-A-N-T K-H-A-P-R-E.

29:23.840 --> 29:26.480
Prashant, I love it.

29:26.480 --> 29:27.600
That's incredible.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.520
Any future question we get about baby names?

29:30.240 --> 29:32.800
Prashant Kapra.

29:33.680 --> 29:36.560
Prashant, or I would also accept Ka-Fredrick.

29:38.480 --> 29:43.040
Okay, if you do name your baby this, make sure they don't get on the internet and ask questions

29:43.040 --> 29:48.640
like, how many months dose baby girl and baby boy takes for delivery?

29:52.080 --> 29:57.360
Generally, on an average, how many months or weeks dose baby boy takes for delivery

29:57.360 --> 29:59.520
and how many dose baby girl takes?

29:59.520 --> 30:02.000
And dose it differ country continent wise?

30:03.760 --> 30:05.680
Whoa, Prashant.

30:05.680 --> 30:07.680
Are those additional details?

30:07.680 --> 30:13.600
Are those months, weeks counted from first day of last menses or from the ovulation?

30:14.880 --> 30:21.360
This person is wildly vacillating between being a scientist and being a stupid person.

30:22.720 --> 30:23.040
Right?

30:23.040 --> 30:27.120
It's like she's cobbled together knowledge from pamphlets she's read.

30:27.120 --> 30:30.160
Yeah, she's just saying things that she's heard like a child.

30:30.160 --> 30:30.960
She's like a child.

30:31.600 --> 30:33.760
Or he, I don't know, Prashant?

30:33.760 --> 30:34.320
Prashant is...

30:34.320 --> 30:37.440
I can't get too mad at Prashant though.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.280
I think it's a lady.

30:39.280 --> 30:39.680
I don't know.

30:39.680 --> 30:44.480
To answer your question, Prashant, what happens is, so there's a gestation period and then

30:44.480 --> 30:50.880
the fetus crawls into the mother's pouch and finishes its development and then is born

30:50.880 --> 30:52.720
with a full knowledge of the world.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.880
But that's not what this question is asking.

30:54.880 --> 30:57.760
Let's break out the flow chart and figure this out.

30:57.760 --> 31:04.240
In America, in North America, the continent of North America, it takes a baby boy 40 weeks

31:04.240 --> 31:05.680
to develop, right?

31:05.680 --> 31:12.080
A baby girl takes around 36, 37 weeks because women develop faster than men.

31:12.080 --> 31:12.720
That's science.

31:14.320 --> 31:19.680
In south of the equator, we'll say South America, it's a little bit faster.

31:19.680 --> 31:23.680
It's about 25 weeks for boys and about 20 weeks for girls.

31:25.040 --> 31:25.760
Antarctica...

31:25.760 --> 31:27.280
That's because of all the coke.

31:27.280 --> 31:31.600
Yeah, Antarctica, it's like, fuck, like a few days.

31:32.400 --> 31:33.040
Oh, really?

31:33.040 --> 31:33.680
Yeah, yeah.

31:35.360 --> 31:38.000
For boys, girls is pretty much instantaneous.

31:40.080 --> 31:44.080
I'm not going to lie, it's rough on the women's bodies down there in Antarctica.

31:44.960 --> 31:46.480
And also on the men's psyche.

31:48.000 --> 31:48.500
Whoa.

31:49.200 --> 31:49.680
Oh, no.

31:52.320 --> 31:53.120
And baby.

31:54.640 --> 31:56.240
You want to do another Yahoo Answer question?

31:56.240 --> 31:59.040
I feel like we didn't get that much traction on the last one.

31:59.040 --> 31:59.680
Yeah, do it.

32:01.200 --> 32:04.640
This Yahoo Answers question was sent in by Chris DePew.

32:05.920 --> 32:06.240
It's...

32:06.240 --> 32:07.680
Wow, he's crushing it.

32:07.680 --> 32:11.600
It's from xxerikaxxcute.

32:12.480 --> 32:15.040
Okay, so it's a man, a 50-year-old man.

32:16.000 --> 32:20.880
Who asks, how to be sexy when you're in eighth grade.

32:22.720 --> 32:23.360
Whoa.

32:23.360 --> 32:26.560
I want to be sexy and I need a man, anyone.

32:26.560 --> 32:27.060
Anyone.

32:29.840 --> 32:34.880
I think a more appropriate question is, how can I not be sexy when I'm in eighth grade, right?

32:35.680 --> 32:38.960
How can I stop finding eighth graders sexy?

32:39.680 --> 32:41.120
I am so bothered right now.

32:41.920 --> 32:43.040
Oh, Jesus.

32:43.040 --> 32:50.240
Just get into Mommy's Cosmos, the magazine, not the beverage, although either one, right?

32:50.240 --> 32:54.160
Yeah, what's up? And just dress like any girl that you see in the book.

32:54.720 --> 32:55.920
Yeah, any girl.

32:55.920 --> 32:56.420
God.

32:57.440 --> 33:01.440
And when you show more skin, that makes men happier.

33:01.440 --> 33:04.400
It makes them think you're nice, I guess.

33:04.400 --> 33:07.360
And make sure to tell everyone that you will accept anyone.

33:08.000 --> 33:08.560
Any man.

33:08.560 --> 33:09.520
Anyone.

33:09.520 --> 33:10.240
On the internet.

33:10.240 --> 33:14.640
Just make sure on the internet you say you will accept any man and you need a man in your eighth

33:14.640 --> 33:14.960
grade.

33:14.960 --> 33:20.720
There's nothing men love more than the sweet smell of desperation.

33:20.720 --> 33:22.320
Preteen desperation.

33:22.320 --> 33:23.040
Someone who's-

33:23.040 --> 33:24.880
I'm afraid of dying alone.

33:24.880 --> 33:27.280
Beaten down by life before they've had a chance to live.

33:27.280 --> 33:28.000
That's what I like.

33:28.880 --> 33:29.380
Yum.

33:30.320 --> 33:32.960
I mean, I understand like it gets hard sometimes.

33:32.960 --> 33:36.000
I mean, the Wiggles got canceled.

33:36.960 --> 33:38.160
I mean, what are you supposed to do now?

33:38.160 --> 33:38.960
What are you supposed to watch?

33:38.960 --> 33:42.560
Justin Bieber's dating that one, that one, that bitch.

33:43.280 --> 33:44.400
I'm not looking for Mr.

33:44.400 --> 33:44.720
White.

33:44.720 --> 33:46.720
I'm looking for Captain Feathersword.

33:50.480 --> 33:53.280
Literally that actor, if he could holler at me.

33:56.960 --> 33:59.600
I'm afraid like Chris Hansen's gonna kick in my door pretty soon.

33:59.600 --> 34:00.880
Yeah, at any moment.

34:00.880 --> 34:07.360
I got a question from Mary via Gmail.

34:07.360 --> 34:10.480
She says, I'm a student at Dartmouth College.

34:10.480 --> 34:13.040
Our official mascot is the big green.

34:13.040 --> 34:17.680
With your bountiful wit and charm, might you be able to devise a mascot that is at least

34:17.680 --> 34:20.720
slightly more domineering than a color swatch?

34:21.280 --> 34:23.440
Mary, I've been thinking about this a lot.

34:24.320 --> 34:34.320
And what I would like to suggest is that you get a mascot who is named after a notable

34:35.040 --> 34:36.240
graduate of Dartmouth.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.160
That sounds logical enough, right?

34:41.280 --> 34:42.320
Let me suggest this.

34:42.320 --> 34:45.680
What about the fightin' Rachel Dratches?

34:48.880 --> 34:54.560
Okay, so just to clear this up, you did some pre-pro for this question, correct?

34:54.560 --> 34:57.760
A little touch of pre-pro.

34:59.040 --> 35:05.440
Might I suggest the fightin' Allison Fennellys, best known for her work as Ellen on Pete and

35:05.440 --> 35:06.160
Pete.

35:06.160 --> 35:08.880
Please tell me that's the full mascot name.

35:08.880 --> 35:10.560
That is the full mascot.

35:10.560 --> 35:18.480
And people be like, all right, let's go fightin' Allison Fennellys, best known for her work

35:18.480 --> 35:20.960
as Ellen on Pete and Pete.

35:21.760 --> 35:26.800
See, I like to think of what the costume for the mascot's gonna be, and I really like the

35:26.800 --> 35:27.840
fightin' racists.

35:28.640 --> 35:30.080
The fightin' racists?

35:30.080 --> 35:30.240
Yeah.

35:30.240 --> 35:33.120
Oh, they look, they dress like Doctor Who?

35:33.120 --> 35:33.360
Yeah.

35:34.400 --> 35:40.000
They show up in a TARDIS and then just come out and hate black people.

35:40.000 --> 35:45.600
What struck me when I read this question, the idea that landed in my mind instantly,

35:45.600 --> 35:47.840
how about the Dartmouth fancy lads?

35:48.640 --> 35:50.160
Oh, just like little gentlemen?

35:50.160 --> 35:56.800
Just like a little foppish gentleman with like a sailor's scarf and a beret and very

35:56.800 --> 35:59.360
short shorts with knee-high stockings.

35:59.360 --> 36:01.040
And maybe a little bit of makeup.

36:01.040 --> 36:03.040
Maybe just a little makeup on his face.

36:05.120 --> 36:05.920
I love it.

36:05.920 --> 36:10.880
What about the fightin' Chandra Rimes as screenwriter, director, and producer for Grey's

36:10.880 --> 36:11.680
Anatomy?

36:11.680 --> 36:13.600
Yeah, Chandra, that's a good one too.

36:13.600 --> 36:14.480
Chandra Rimes.

36:14.480 --> 36:18.000
Her costume could just be a woman having sex with television and destroying it.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.200
Just fucking it up for everybody.

36:23.200 --> 36:24.160
Oh, shit.

36:24.160 --> 36:24.880
Oh, God.

36:24.880 --> 36:27.120
What about the battling Aisha Tylers?

36:27.920 --> 36:32.480
See, now I've got a Wikipedia Dartmouth College so I can get in on all the fun that you're

36:32.480 --> 36:33.200
having right now.

36:33.200 --> 36:33.920
I've used them up.

36:33.920 --> 36:34.880
I'm sorry, it's cached.

36:34.880 --> 36:35.360
Oh, no.

36:35.360 --> 36:40.160
I don't know where she went to college, but the fightin' Angela Lansbury's, I think

36:40.160 --> 36:44.320
it's just really intimidating and at the same time just a beautiful symbol.

36:44.320 --> 36:47.520
I have to imagine that she went to college somewhere European.

36:48.240 --> 36:52.960
Yeah, something like University or something.

36:52.960 --> 36:53.920
Something fancy.

36:54.800 --> 36:56.720
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

36:56.720 --> 37:02.240
But before we move on to that, I did want to tell you that you've been listening to

37:02.240 --> 37:02.560
My Brother.

37:02.560 --> 37:05.360
My Brother and Me, it's an advice show for the modern era.

37:06.480 --> 37:11.040
If you want to ask us a question, you can do so on mbnbam.com.

37:11.040 --> 37:12.880
All the different methods are there.

37:13.520 --> 37:16.320
You can also buy our app, the My Brother.

37:16.320 --> 37:17.760
My Brother and Me app experience.

37:19.440 --> 37:25.920
Get it on iTunes and methods to ask us questions are there.

37:25.920 --> 37:33.120
If you want to buy clothing for My Brother, My Brother and Me, there are some very few

37:36.400 --> 37:38.400
t-shirts still in the store.

37:39.040 --> 37:41.680
We are going to be restocking very soon.

37:43.120 --> 37:46.160
The mediums on the logo shirt are sold out.

37:46.800 --> 37:49.280
The larges on the logo shirt are sold out.

37:51.040 --> 37:53.440
I mean, there are times or it's tight times over there.

37:53.440 --> 37:56.160
So if you want something, go over there and get it.

37:57.520 --> 38:03.600
The Hey Jeffrey shirt, we probably won't be doing another version of the logo shirt.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.680
We will probably do it in a different color.

38:06.240 --> 38:10.880
So if you got any requests, we've got a Facebook thread up that you can go weigh in on.

38:10.880 --> 38:14.400
And you should join the My Brother, My Brother and Me appreciation group too.

38:15.040 --> 38:17.280
Because it's a group of really nice people.

38:20.080 --> 38:20.960
What else am I forgetting?

38:20.960 --> 38:21.840
Thanks again to the Hoff.

38:21.840 --> 38:23.440
Thank you so much Hoff.

38:24.080 --> 38:24.800
Thanks Hoff.

38:26.080 --> 38:28.400
Thanks to everybody who's been holding parties.

38:29.600 --> 38:30.640
Yes, yes.

38:30.640 --> 38:33.840
We didn't, I don't think I got an invite to the latest MondLock.

38:33.840 --> 38:38.000
But I'm sure that the MondLock party is still rolling, as is the Nugent.

38:39.840 --> 38:43.760
My favorite stories we've gotten are the people who have accidental listening parties.

38:43.760 --> 38:46.960
Just because I like the image of the moment of like looking around and going, wait,

38:47.520 --> 38:49.440
I have like 10 people here listening.

38:49.440 --> 38:50.880
This is a party.

38:50.880 --> 38:51.920
Oh my goodness.

38:52.960 --> 39:04.800
The, yeah, we have an alpha and, no, we have a prime and a beta listening fan club.

39:04.800 --> 39:09.120
So if you want to be Trace, if you want to be the triple,

39:10.480 --> 39:13.200
get in touch with us and let us know who's going to be at the party.

39:14.400 --> 39:19.200
We will record something for you, a personal greeting for your party.

39:19.200 --> 39:22.880
The only thing you have to do is take some pictures.

39:22.880 --> 39:29.280
We had a newcomer from, in the form of Michael Sinodis that had a listening party last week.

39:29.280 --> 39:31.520
I don't know if this is going to be a perpetual thing though.

39:31.520 --> 39:34.960
He's got to prove himself if he wants that, if he wants that Delta status.

39:35.840 --> 39:36.160
Yeah.

39:36.160 --> 39:37.280
Or no, he would be triple.

39:37.280 --> 39:38.640
I mean, he got in there.

39:38.640 --> 39:38.880
Yeah.

39:39.600 --> 39:39.840
Yeah.

39:41.440 --> 39:45.280
So thank you again, as always, like we can't thank you enough.

39:45.280 --> 39:48.960
Thank you for rating the show on iTunes and reviewing the show on iTunes.

39:48.960 --> 39:52.480
And telling your friends about it and everything.

39:53.120 --> 39:54.240
It means a lot to us.

39:54.240 --> 39:58.960
I want to thank, let's see, let's do some shout outs.

39:58.960 --> 40:04.400
Modest Madison, always turning out the recommendations.

40:05.200 --> 40:05.920
Thank you.

40:05.920 --> 40:08.960
Thank you, Stackmasters.

40:10.480 --> 40:10.960
Yeah.

40:10.960 --> 40:18.960
And oh, thank you, J.D. Short, who reminded me last night that we had to do the show.

40:19.680 --> 40:23.200
I was in a drunken fugue state after watching the Red Sluice Playoffs.

40:23.200 --> 40:26.560
And I had forgotten completely to get the question list together.

40:26.560 --> 40:28.320
And he reminded me to record the show.

40:28.320 --> 40:29.440
So thank you.

40:29.440 --> 40:30.800
Thank you, J.D. Short.

40:30.800 --> 40:36.400
Also, our buddy Brentle Floss spied somebody at New York Comic Con walking around with

40:36.400 --> 40:37.760
an NBNB AM shirt.

40:37.760 --> 40:38.320
Oh, really?

40:38.960 --> 40:39.200
Yes.

40:39.200 --> 40:40.400
That's awesome.

40:40.400 --> 40:40.800
Yeah.

40:40.800 --> 40:43.360
And there's a guy right behind him in a surgical mask.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.440
It's a pretty great picture.

40:45.440 --> 40:47.520
If that was you, holler.

40:48.720 --> 40:49.680
Let us know.

40:49.680 --> 40:51.280
We'll be your friend forever.

40:51.280 --> 40:51.920
Okay.

40:51.920 --> 40:55.040
Griffin, give us the final question.

40:55.040 --> 40:58.960
That question we'll ponder and think on for the remainder of the week.

40:59.760 --> 41:00.000
Okay.

41:00.000 --> 41:09.280
This question was sent in by this week's Platinum Question Submitter, Submissioner, Submariner.

41:09.280 --> 41:10.080
Chris DePew.

41:10.640 --> 41:11.760
Wow, hat trick.

41:11.760 --> 41:13.520
Hat trick from the CDP.

41:14.640 --> 41:17.280
It's from Yahoo Answers user, Sarebear, who asks,

41:18.240 --> 41:19.840
my goldfish are very quiet?

41:25.600 --> 41:26.880
Justin McElroy.

41:26.880 --> 41:28.080
I'm Travis McElroy.

41:28.080 --> 41:29.120
I'm Griffin McElroy.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.200
He's been my brother and my brother.

41:31.200 --> 41:33.520
May he kiss your dad square on the lips.

41:33.520 --> 41:40.320
Pack up your bags, get out of town.

41:41.440 --> 41:46.000
You had a good run, but it's all over now.

41:47.120 --> 41:51.760
Toss all of it in, pack up by tonight.

41:51.760 --> 42:06.960
Toss all of your woes in that black Samsonite.
