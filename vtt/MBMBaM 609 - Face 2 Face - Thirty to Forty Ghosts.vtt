WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.360
The McElroy brothers are not experts.

00:03.360 --> 00:08.560
It's been a while, right?

00:08.560 --> 00:13.680
I don't memorize this shit.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.800
And their advice should never be followed.

00:16.800 --> 00:22.680
Oh, Travis claims he's a sexpert.

00:22.680 --> 00:25.800
But if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:25.800 --> 00:31.600
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:31.600 --> 00:35.280
will know how cool they are for listening.

00:35.280 --> 00:38.800
What's up, you cool baby?

00:38.800 --> 00:59.800
Because my life, it's better, it's better with you.

00:59.800 --> 01:12.280
My life, it's better with you.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.680
Hi, everyone.

01:13.680 --> 01:18.400
Welcome to my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

01:18.400 --> 01:27.000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin Ignatius McElroy.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.720
I'm your middle brother, Travis Jedediah McElroy.

01:34.720 --> 01:35.720
No jokes this time, guys.

01:35.720 --> 01:38.600
It's just me, Griffin.

01:38.600 --> 01:41.760
Yeah, I'm so yeah.

01:41.760 --> 01:47.480
Griffin's lackadaisical approach to his introduction mirrors, I would say, his lackadaisical approach

01:47.480 --> 01:48.480
to his garments.

01:48.480 --> 01:49.480
Yeah.

01:49.480 --> 01:54.880
We did talk about it like before, before anybody packed or anything.

01:54.880 --> 01:55.880
Yeah.

01:55.880 --> 01:57.360
I went to Skeffington's.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.920
Yeah, Justin got himself a tuxedo.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.560
I rented a tuxedo.

02:02.560 --> 02:08.280
I packed three different jacket, tie, and shirt combinations.

02:08.280 --> 02:11.120
That must be fun to travel with.

02:11.120 --> 02:13.920
No, but they're worth it, Griffin.

02:13.920 --> 02:14.920
They're worth it.

02:14.920 --> 02:15.920
You're worth it.

02:15.920 --> 02:16.920
You back there.

02:16.920 --> 02:17.920
Hey.

02:17.920 --> 02:21.640
Yeah, my suitcase weighs 55 pounds, no lie.

02:21.640 --> 02:25.000
Matt, poor Matt, had a flat tire on the interstate.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.320
You owe it to Matt to dress up.

02:27.320 --> 02:32.000
I mean, I bought this special shirt.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
You didn't rent it.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
But this is you guys.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.760
I can't move my body to the- Yeah, that is true.

02:36.760 --> 02:39.080
I can't give a sudden hug.

02:39.080 --> 02:41.480
Okay, let's get started.

02:41.480 --> 02:43.560
This is an advice show.

02:43.560 --> 02:49.120
We take your questions and turn them alchemy-like into wisdom after two years of hiatus.

02:49.120 --> 02:55.040
We have emerged like the Chilean miners back from underneath the ground to you.

02:55.040 --> 02:59.240
And I don't want you to waste any more time in answering these questions.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.240
So here we go.

03:00.240 --> 03:01.240
Now wait before we start.

03:01.240 --> 03:02.240
Okay.

03:02.240 --> 03:05.720
In the spirit of Fancy Takes Flight, I thought that maybe we could elevate the show a little

03:05.720 --> 03:10.040
bit because it's been a little bit puerile lately, a little bit juvenile.

03:10.040 --> 03:15.360
So I thought it would be nice if we maybe elevated things with a little work of fort.

03:15.360 --> 03:16.360
Yeah.

03:16.360 --> 03:24.840
I hope you like bits.

03:24.840 --> 03:28.400
This one is all film related, classic films.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.400
Okay.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.840
A group of teens- God, I wish I didn't get so competitive about

03:32.840 --> 03:33.840
this.

03:33.840 --> 03:36.000
But just- Hey, don't shout it out because you will probably-

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Yeah, don't shout it out.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Law of large numbers.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
You'll probably get it before us.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Okay.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Don't shout it out.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Also, they're not that clever.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
So many of you will get it.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Hey.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Okay.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
I've been working on these for three days.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Okay.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Okay.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.440
A group of teens spends the day in detention.

03:50.440 --> 03:54.680
Each of them comes from a different social group, but they end up bonding over the fact

03:54.680 --> 03:56.680
that they all have boners.

03:56.680 --> 03:58.680
The Breakfast Chub.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.000
You didn't ding, ding, ding.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.960
Ding, ding, ding.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.760
It was clearly The Breakfast Chub.

04:03.760 --> 04:04.760
Okay.

04:04.760 --> 04:05.760
That's a tie.

04:05.760 --> 04:06.900
No, I'm sorry, Justin.

04:06.900 --> 04:07.900
You did not ring in.

04:07.900 --> 04:08.900
Okay.

04:08.900 --> 04:09.900
You're right.

04:09.900 --> 04:10.900
No, you're right.

04:10.900 --> 04:11.900
It's fine.

04:11.900 --> 04:12.900
It's fine.

04:12.900 --> 04:13.900
It's fine.

04:13.900 --> 04:14.900
It's fine.

04:14.900 --> 04:15.900
It's the Breakfast Chub.

04:15.900 --> 04:16.900
It doesn't.

04:16.900 --> 04:17.900
It doesn't.

04:17.900 --> 04:18.900
Couldn't matter less.

04:18.900 --> 04:23.480
A rebellious patient at a mental institution stands up to tight-fisted nerds, Ratched,

04:23.480 --> 04:25.720
when she tries to stop them from taking dumps.

04:25.720 --> 04:27.220
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

04:27.220 --> 04:28.600
One flew over the doo-doo's nest?

04:28.600 --> 04:29.600
I'll accept it.

04:29.600 --> 04:30.600
Yes.

04:30.600 --> 04:33.920
Well, we also would have accepted one flew over the poo-poo's nest.

04:33.920 --> 04:36.600
Either way works, I guess, or doesn't work.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.240
One more.

04:38.240 --> 04:39.240
One more?

04:39.240 --> 04:40.240
One more.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.240
One more.

04:41.240 --> 04:44.600
In this classic black and white film, a reporter tries to understand a rich and powerful man's

04:44.600 --> 04:47.760
mysterious last words, I need to take a crap.

04:47.760 --> 04:50.840
Turns out it was the name of his sled.

04:50.840 --> 04:55.040
I mean- I mean, I know that- I know the film you're referencing, but there's nothing-

04:55.040 --> 04:56.040
I can't imagine.

04:56.040 --> 04:57.040
I mean, okay.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.040
Ding, ding, ding.

04:58.040 --> 04:59.040
Yeah.

04:59.040 --> 05:02.280
It's Citizen Kane, but the sled was called Rosebutt?

05:02.280 --> 05:03.280
No.

05:03.280 --> 05:04.280
Justin?

05:04.280 --> 05:05.280
Sit, sit, sit.

05:05.280 --> 05:06.280
I got nothing.

05:06.280 --> 05:10.280
The answer we were looking for was Shitizen Kane.

05:10.280 --> 05:13.520
Damn it!

05:13.520 --> 05:16.320
Motherfucker!

05:16.320 --> 05:19.320
That one- that sucks for me and you.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.320
Yeah.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.320
Yeah.

05:21.320 --> 05:22.320
I can't believe you didn't get it.

05:22.320 --> 05:23.320
That was right there.

05:23.320 --> 05:24.320
Did you all know?

05:24.320 --> 05:25.320
Shitizen.

05:25.320 --> 05:26.320
Yeah, they- of course they knew.

05:26.320 --> 05:27.320
There's a billion of them.

05:27.320 --> 05:28.320
Yeah.

05:28.320 --> 05:29.320
Now, that wasn't everybody, though.

05:29.320 --> 05:31.720
I would say that was only about 10% of the audience, and you're all terrible, too.

05:31.720 --> 05:34.200
Okay, now we're going to help people.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.160
I recently got my first job.

05:36.160 --> 05:40.000
These are all from your region, by the way, so blame yourselves.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.320
Take a look in the mirror.

05:41.320 --> 05:43.360
This is what you are.

05:43.360 --> 05:46.440
I recently got my first job since the beginning of the pandemic.

05:46.440 --> 05:50.440
It's wonderful, but I've come across a lunchtime predicament.

05:50.440 --> 05:53.840
I'm a messy eater, and I always stain my shirts.

05:53.840 --> 05:59.320
When I was quarantining, I would simply remove my shirt for meals.

05:59.320 --> 06:01.160
This worked well then, but obviously I can't-

06:01.160 --> 06:03.200
Except for the tummy stains.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.200
Yeah.

06:04.200 --> 06:06.440
Obviously, I can't continue this.

06:06.440 --> 06:07.440
What should I do?

06:07.440 --> 06:09.580
That's from running out of clean shirts.

06:09.580 --> 06:10.580
Are you here?

06:10.580 --> 06:11.580
Oh, why?

06:11.580 --> 06:14.400
Yeah, I wouldn't fess up to that either.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.960
I did think about this when we got that one in.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.680
You want us to say this in front of people?

06:19.680 --> 06:21.080
You want us to read this one, huh?

06:21.080 --> 06:22.080
Okay.

06:22.080 --> 06:25.720
Yeah, because my gut tells me, eat better.

06:25.720 --> 06:26.720
Just eat differently.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.480
Do a better job.

06:28.480 --> 06:30.200
That's clearly not on the table.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.160
Slower, perhaps?

06:32.160 --> 06:34.680
Or at least drier food.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.640
Eat dry food that won't stain.

06:36.640 --> 06:39.460
You don't deserve wet food.

06:39.460 --> 06:43.720
Wet food is for careful boys.

06:43.720 --> 06:44.880
Meal choice is huge.

06:44.880 --> 06:47.660
If you don't want to improve your technique, which who has the time?

06:47.660 --> 06:48.660
Meal choice is huge.

06:48.660 --> 06:53.920
Do you open up your cupboard and there's just a wall of SpaghettiOs?

06:53.920 --> 06:55.080
You today, I believe.

06:55.080 --> 06:57.800
Oh no, it's Wednesday, rib day.

06:57.800 --> 06:58.800
Rib day.

06:58.800 --> 07:02.920
Today I'm having red wine rib gravy, delicious.

07:02.920 --> 07:05.880
And of course, soup with no spoon.

07:05.880 --> 07:12.080
Do you know that it's, you did have the pandemic times and you could have worked, you know,

07:12.080 --> 07:15.200
they say if you come out of this pandemic and you haven't learned to stop eating without

07:15.200 --> 07:17.720
spilling all over yourself, what have you done?

07:17.720 --> 07:21.600
This is your opportunity to learn to work and eat better and I think that the window

07:21.600 --> 07:22.600
has closed.

07:22.600 --> 07:26.600
I mean, there's also lunch smock right there, lunch raincoat.

07:26.600 --> 07:31.280
Get a branded lunch smock available at macroemerch.com.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.240
It says, I'm a fucking mess on it.

07:33.240 --> 07:34.240
I'm a wreck.

07:34.240 --> 07:35.240
I'm a disaster.

07:35.240 --> 07:37.840
I don't know how to eat food good.

07:37.840 --> 07:41.480
That's two hard words to say right back to food good.

07:41.480 --> 07:43.360
I can do it very easily now, of course.

07:43.360 --> 07:44.360
Yeah.

07:44.360 --> 07:45.360
Cause you're focused.

07:45.360 --> 07:46.360
You're dialed in.

07:46.360 --> 07:47.360
With a run up to it.

07:47.360 --> 07:48.360
Yeah.

07:48.360 --> 07:49.360
With a little bit of practice.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.360
Sure.

07:50.360 --> 07:53.440
Can you have two, can you just wear two of the same shirt to work?

07:53.440 --> 07:54.800
Post lunch, whip it off.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.600
You got a clean one right underneath.

07:56.600 --> 07:59.960
Oh, but you could, then you could keep the nasty shirt at your desk.

07:59.960 --> 08:00.960
This is my lunch shirt.

08:00.960 --> 08:01.960
Do not smell.

08:01.960 --> 08:02.960
Oh, there you go.

08:02.960 --> 08:03.960
Do not smell the lunch shirt.

08:03.960 --> 08:04.960
Do not smell.

08:04.960 --> 08:07.080
Do not smell this shirt.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.640
Do not open the baggie with shirt in it.

08:09.640 --> 08:12.480
You could also, if you have your own office, you could lock the door and take your shirt

08:12.480 --> 08:13.480
off to eat.

08:13.480 --> 08:17.120
But oh God, you gotta check that the door is locked.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.520
It's a great conversation starter.

08:18.520 --> 08:22.080
But then you get, here's, here's my problem with shirtless eating.

08:22.080 --> 08:23.700
Well, hold on, sorry.

08:23.700 --> 08:29.640
My first of 312 problems with shirtless eating is that you eat the spaghetti-o's.

08:29.640 --> 08:34.200
You do get the wet red stuff on your tummy and then you put the shirt back on, it's still

08:34.200 --> 08:35.920
going to get the wet red stuff on the shirt.

08:35.920 --> 08:42.120
I've seen you have a towel, you have a lunch towel, a classic office lunch towel.

08:42.120 --> 08:46.720
It's weird how if you, as an adult, and I've done this a few times, if you, if you take

08:46.720 --> 08:51.160
the napkin and you stuff it into your shirt, people make fun of you.

08:51.160 --> 08:52.880
And it's like, I'm trying to be elegant.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.140
This is for you.

08:54.140 --> 08:55.140
This is for you.

08:55.140 --> 08:56.680
I want you to enjoy a clean shirt.

08:56.680 --> 08:58.240
I don't have to see my dirty shirt.

08:58.240 --> 08:59.240
You do.

08:59.240 --> 09:00.240
Oh, what about this?

09:00.240 --> 09:05.160
Stained cape, right, and then at lunch, flipped that bad boy around and now it's on the front.

09:05.160 --> 09:06.160
Oh.

09:06.160 --> 09:07.160
Yeah.

09:07.160 --> 09:08.160
That's good.

09:08.160 --> 09:11.240
And then, after lunch, stained cape.

09:11.240 --> 09:14.240
Can you just, wait, can you just, save a step, turn your shirt backwards?

09:14.240 --> 09:15.240
There you go.

09:15.240 --> 09:16.440
After you stained the front of it.

09:16.440 --> 09:18.920
And then when someone's like, you have a stain on the back of your shirt, I'm like, someone

09:18.920 --> 09:20.920
must have been eating messy behind me.

09:20.920 --> 09:21.920
Oh no.

09:21.920 --> 09:22.920
Oh man.

09:22.920 --> 09:25.320
Why do I sit in front of messy people all the time?

09:25.320 --> 09:26.920
Oh, I bet it was Doug.

09:26.920 --> 09:31.280
I would never stain my shirt, but Doug, the person who's in the job above me would.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.280
Yeah.

09:32.280 --> 09:36.320
Dougie Meatballs, who works in the upper cubicle.

09:36.320 --> 09:40.960
I recently turned 21 and I am learning that every time I consume an alcoholic beverage

09:40.960 --> 09:45.240
or engage in the devil's lettuce, I am overcome with-

09:45.240 --> 09:46.240
Iceberg.

09:46.240 --> 09:51.920
And I am profound and insatiable vegetable lust.

09:51.920 --> 09:57.160
I'm talking, I take three sips of a gin and tonic and I am on the floor of my kitchen

09:57.160 --> 09:59.400
eating whole carrots from the bag.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.400
Okay.

10:00.400 --> 10:05.640
No timeout real quick, for future reference question asker, vegetable lust might be confused

10:05.640 --> 10:06.640
for something else.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.760
Not how I would have froze it.

10:08.760 --> 10:09.760
Yeah.

10:09.760 --> 10:16.160
No tomato, leafy, green, or tasty plant of any kind is safe from my monstrous desire.

10:16.160 --> 10:17.840
Why the fuck does this happen?

10:17.840 --> 10:18.840
What do I do?

10:18.840 --> 10:23.240
How do I mitigate this hog wild behavior with the fact that I drink with friends who are

10:23.240 --> 10:27.440
not immediately overcome with my same veggie related needs?

10:27.440 --> 10:29.160
That's from the veggie vagabond.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.160
Are you here?

10:30.160 --> 10:31.160
Hey.

10:31.160 --> 10:32.160
You're very close.

10:32.160 --> 10:33.160
Okay.

10:33.160 --> 10:34.160
Hello.

10:34.160 --> 10:39.440
You're not normally this close when we do these, but we're going to roll with it.

10:39.440 --> 10:43.720
Are you asking us how to stop eating vegetables?

10:43.720 --> 10:46.240
Because you've come to the right place.

10:46.240 --> 10:47.240
Yeah.

10:47.240 --> 10:48.240
Yeah.

10:48.240 --> 10:54.000
And just to sum up, your problem is whenever I get drunk or high, I make healthy choices.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.320
You're not.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.200
What do I do to stop this?

10:57.200 --> 10:59.280
You have, you have a superpower.

10:59.280 --> 11:01.200
You don't have anything that needs fixed.

11:01.200 --> 11:06.340
Like do you know, do you know that when you get high, you can eat loose pepperonis out

11:06.340 --> 11:07.340
of a bag.

11:07.340 --> 11:13.040
Have you been eating your child's leftover Halloween candy in April?

11:13.040 --> 11:16.640
Have you heard of a Cadbury mini eggs in the freezer?

11:16.640 --> 11:19.080
Like that's what they're there for.

11:19.080 --> 11:24.800
You could hear your wife say, this box of Girl Scout cookies was full yesterday.

11:24.800 --> 11:27.240
And you go, oh, Lily, the dog.

11:27.240 --> 11:29.000
There's not a three.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.520
You don't have a problem.

11:31.520 --> 11:37.800
This is a great habit unless, unless your like vegetable budget is through the roof.

11:37.800 --> 11:38.960
That's the only thing.

11:38.960 --> 11:39.960
That's true.

11:39.960 --> 11:43.440
You know, in this country, we don't subsidize produce as much as we should, and we don't

11:43.440 --> 11:49.520
have the sort of fresh local, because they're not shelf stable.

11:49.520 --> 11:50.520
We got it.

11:50.520 --> 11:51.880
There's food deserts.

11:51.880 --> 11:52.880
It's a whole thing.

11:52.880 --> 11:56.000
You thought they'd keep clapping when you said food deserts, huh?

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Seaspiracy.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Look it up.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
No.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Read a book.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Read a book.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.120
It would irritate me if I ate all my good roasting broccoli.

12:05.120 --> 12:09.520
And then the next, the next day I wanted to eat some roasted broccoli and I didn't have

12:09.520 --> 12:10.520
it.

12:10.520 --> 12:11.520
I'm like, ah, hi Justin.

12:11.520 --> 12:12.520
You got me again.

12:12.520 --> 12:15.680
I said, hi, hi Justin ain't going to roast that broccoli.

12:15.680 --> 12:18.040
Hi Justin is eating it right off the stock.

12:18.040 --> 12:23.240
And now sober Justin has to order crinkle fries from Arby's because I don't have another

12:23.240 --> 12:26.140
side dish.

12:26.140 --> 12:27.840
This is a gift that keeps on giving.

12:27.840 --> 12:28.960
There's no bad part of it.

12:28.960 --> 12:29.960
I'm trying.

12:29.960 --> 12:33.080
It's a weird twist on Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

12:33.080 --> 12:36.080
If Dr. Jekyll is like, I got to get rid of Mr. Hyde.

12:36.080 --> 12:41.440
He paid my taxes on time and called my mom on her birthday.

12:41.440 --> 12:44.080
Ah, curse you Hyde.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.320
Is there such a thing as too much fiber?

12:46.320 --> 12:47.320
Oh yeah.

12:47.320 --> 12:48.320
Oh yeah.

12:48.320 --> 12:49.320
Oh yeah.

12:49.320 --> 12:53.840
I think it probably gives away the fact that I'm not getting enough fiber that I have to

12:53.840 --> 12:54.840
ask that.

12:54.840 --> 12:59.400
I've never even come close to that threshold.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.760
What if you, what if, okay.

13:01.760 --> 13:06.440
What if they just really don't like vegetables?

13:06.440 --> 13:07.720
Now think on it.

13:07.720 --> 13:11.320
You get a craving, but you don't like them, but your body wants them.

13:11.320 --> 13:12.320
Do you like vegetables?

13:12.320 --> 13:13.320
Sorry, hold on.

13:13.320 --> 13:14.320
This is ridiculous.

13:14.320 --> 13:15.320
Do you like vegetables?

13:15.320 --> 13:16.320
Yeah.

13:16.320 --> 13:17.320
Yeah.

13:17.320 --> 13:18.320
Okay.

13:18.320 --> 13:19.320
They do like vegetables.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.960
I mean, one time when I was on shrooms, I ate a whole pizza, uh, but that was because

13:21.960 --> 13:25.160
it made my mouth taste like a party.

13:25.160 --> 13:30.840
Sure, sure.

13:30.840 --> 13:34.160
That's because it was a time pizza and it was starting to slip through the cracks of

13:34.160 --> 13:35.160
the universe.

13:35.160 --> 13:36.160
You get it.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.160
You get it.

13:37.160 --> 13:38.160
You get it.

13:38.160 --> 13:39.160
Every pepperoni had Don Knot's face on it.

13:39.160 --> 13:40.160
You understand.

13:40.160 --> 13:41.600
That's all of it.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.640
And the pizza was taunting me.

13:43.640 --> 13:44.640
Okay.

13:44.640 --> 13:46.420
Well, have you bragged enough?

13:46.420 --> 13:47.420
May we move on?

13:47.420 --> 13:50.260
No, I, well, here's what I can picture, right?

13:50.260 --> 13:53.360
You're getting drunk and high with friends and you're like, oh, you know what I could

13:53.360 --> 13:54.360
really go for?

13:54.360 --> 13:55.360
And they're like, oh, a hamburger.

13:55.360 --> 13:59.880
And you're like, some broccoli rabe and they're like, get the fuck out.

13:59.880 --> 14:06.160
I can see where that might be socially uncomfortable, but like, bring it with you, bring it with

14:06.160 --> 14:07.720
you, have it in your pocket.

14:07.720 --> 14:09.520
Just have loose carrots in your pocket.

14:09.520 --> 14:13.800
I cannot think of a worse thing to do to a high friend.

14:13.800 --> 14:17.040
Then you're sitting there and you're talking to them and you just slowly sneak a little

14:17.040 --> 14:18.040
baby carrot.

14:18.040 --> 14:19.040
Oh yeah.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.040
Crunch, crunch, crunch.

14:20.040 --> 14:21.040
Yeah.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.040
What?

14:22.040 --> 14:23.040
And also.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.040
Are those Cheetos?

14:24.040 --> 14:27.780
Well, their nature is Cheetos.

14:27.780 --> 14:32.760
And the disappointment they'll feel when they cash the bong and they're like, anybody else

14:32.760 --> 14:34.520
holding any good green stuff?

14:34.520 --> 14:38.160
And you're like, oh yeah.

14:38.160 --> 14:39.220
Brutabaga.

14:39.220 --> 14:40.220
What color is rutabaga?

14:40.220 --> 14:41.220
I genuinely.

14:41.220 --> 14:42.220
It's kale.

14:42.220 --> 14:43.220
Rutabaga's gotta be red, right?

14:43.220 --> 14:44.220
You know what's weird?

14:44.220 --> 14:46.600
I now have a real serious craving for vegetables.

14:46.600 --> 14:47.600
Yeah?

14:47.600 --> 14:48.600
Yeah.

14:48.600 --> 14:49.600
I'd love to eat.

14:49.600 --> 14:50.600
No, not, no.

14:50.600 --> 14:51.600
No.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.600
No.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.600
You got me good.

14:53.600 --> 14:54.600
I can't get that drunk during a show.

14:54.600 --> 14:55.600
Come on.

14:55.600 --> 15:00.040
My girlfriend and I have been living in our apartment for about two years now.

15:00.040 --> 15:03.280
And our upstairs neighbor is quite obviously a gamer.

15:03.280 --> 15:04.280
Hashtag.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.600
He has, you say, I think you have to say it before.

15:06.600 --> 15:07.600
No, gamer hashtag.

15:07.600 --> 15:08.600
Okay.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.080
He's a very nice guy.

15:10.080 --> 15:13.960
Welcomed us when we moved in and everything, but he has always been very loud when he plays

15:13.960 --> 15:17.640
games with his friends, stomping on the ground, shouting, et cetera.

15:17.640 --> 15:18.640
Standard gamer.

15:18.640 --> 15:19.640
However.

15:19.640 --> 15:20.640
Just regular old gamer stuff.

15:20.640 --> 15:21.640
Classic gamer stuff.

15:21.640 --> 15:22.640
However.

15:22.640 --> 15:23.640
Textbook.

15:23.640 --> 15:24.640
That's not the issue.

15:24.640 --> 15:30.800
A month or two ago, we noticed he hasn't been loudly gaming anymore.

15:30.800 --> 15:31.800
That's right.

15:31.800 --> 15:32.800
You guessed it.

15:32.800 --> 15:38.080
He died controller in hand, just like he always dreams.

15:38.080 --> 15:40.240
How he would have wanted to go.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.040
Him and Master Chief, Thelma and Louise.

15:43.040 --> 15:46.640
The loving embrace of Fortnite.

15:46.640 --> 15:53.460
We actually got kind of used to his noise.

15:53.460 --> 15:57.020
It was just sort of comforting and funny to hear someone else around.

15:57.020 --> 15:59.560
And now it just feels too quiet.

15:59.560 --> 16:05.000
My question is, how do I approach my neighbor and ask him to go back to his noisy gaming

16:05.000 --> 16:07.360
for our normalcy without sounding like a freak?

16:07.360 --> 16:10.480
Just from a little too quiet, are you here?

16:10.480 --> 16:11.480
What?

16:11.480 --> 16:14.120
How did that happen?

16:14.120 --> 16:16.840
You're right behind the other person that was here too.

16:16.840 --> 16:17.840
Hello.

16:17.840 --> 16:18.840
Okay.

16:18.840 --> 16:23.200
Do we have some sort of promotion where if you sit in the first three rows, we answer

16:23.200 --> 16:24.200
your...

16:24.200 --> 16:25.200
Okay, anyway.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.880
Maybe they had a falling out with their gaming group.

16:27.880 --> 16:28.880
With their Fortnite squad.

16:28.880 --> 16:32.240
Oh, you got to patch things up.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.280
You have to patch it up rom-com style.

16:34.280 --> 16:38.000
Oh, this game has another patch, and this time it's friendship.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Yeah.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.160
Patching up your relationship.

16:40.160 --> 16:46.360
You need to do sort of a parent trap, but for gamers, gamer trap, and you like lure

16:46.360 --> 16:52.720
them into like a raid, maybe like one of the hard ones, and you're like, I need help, and

16:52.720 --> 16:54.160
then they all do it together.

16:54.160 --> 16:55.160
Yeah, man.

16:55.160 --> 16:58.640
That all sounds like definitely real gamer opportunities.

16:58.640 --> 17:00.440
Yeah, it's like gamers stuff.

17:00.440 --> 17:01.440
You guys get it.

17:01.440 --> 17:02.440
Sure.

17:02.440 --> 17:04.360
I've become a books person myself.

17:04.360 --> 17:06.160
Maybe they've become a books person.

17:06.160 --> 17:07.160
There've been a lot of...

17:07.160 --> 17:14.920
Listen, there've been a lot of good books lately.

17:14.920 --> 17:18.360
Everyone's always talking about how good books are right now.

17:18.360 --> 17:22.320
Well, it's just like book graphics keep getting better and better.

17:22.320 --> 17:23.320
Right?

17:23.320 --> 17:24.320
That's true.

17:24.320 --> 17:26.040
You need to go up there and just take all their books away.

17:26.040 --> 17:27.040
Because if they...

17:27.040 --> 17:28.040
Oh, yeah.

17:28.040 --> 17:29.040
And burn them.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.040
Wait.

17:30.040 --> 17:31.040
No.

17:31.040 --> 17:32.040
What?

17:32.040 --> 17:33.040
What?

17:33.040 --> 17:34.040
No.

17:34.040 --> 17:35.040
On to DVDs.

17:35.040 --> 17:36.040
Yeah.

17:36.040 --> 17:37.040
Is what he was going to say.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.040
And then melt those in a fire.

17:39.040 --> 17:40.040
No.

17:40.040 --> 17:41.040
No.

17:41.040 --> 17:42.040
Damn it.

17:42.040 --> 17:45.720
Maybe they're just waiting for a new game that's really fun, and maybe you could make

17:45.720 --> 17:46.720
that game.

17:46.720 --> 17:47.720
Ooh.

17:47.720 --> 17:48.720
Yeah.

17:48.720 --> 17:50.720
Maybe you base it on them.

17:50.720 --> 17:51.720
Yeah.

17:51.720 --> 17:52.720
And something you know about them.

17:52.720 --> 17:57.200
Maybe you make it out of like a cardboard box that you cut some holes in, and then it

17:57.200 --> 18:02.840
comes with a little ball, and they have to get the ball into the holes from far away

18:02.840 --> 18:03.840
or something.

18:03.840 --> 18:04.840
It sounds good.

18:04.840 --> 18:05.840
Oh, the look on his face.

18:05.840 --> 18:06.840
Oh, the delight.

18:06.840 --> 18:07.840
Thank you.

18:07.840 --> 18:10.640
I ran out of games.

18:10.640 --> 18:15.240
And you can hang over his shoulder the whole time like, this is Sergeant Bloodmash.

18:15.240 --> 18:17.880
Yes, we need you to get the enemy base.

18:17.880 --> 18:21.640
They're in the hole number four with the blue circle around it.

18:21.640 --> 18:22.640
Yeah.

18:22.640 --> 18:23.640
Kill streak.

18:23.640 --> 18:24.640
Achievement points.

18:24.640 --> 18:34.760
Uh-oh, here comes a babe, but you got to have DLC for it.

18:34.760 --> 18:36.600
It's the second box they have to pay $5.

18:36.600 --> 18:37.600
Oh, yeah.

18:37.600 --> 18:38.600
The babe box.

18:38.600 --> 18:45.320
The babe box you get for winning the box war.

18:45.320 --> 18:48.160
I think the three of us are the only ones who like this bit.

18:48.160 --> 18:52.960
You don't, but you don't have a second box, so you have to make an announcement like,

18:52.960 --> 18:59.840
we're so sorry to let down our mini fans, we do have to delay box two, the babe box.

18:59.840 --> 19:01.840
We just want to take all the time to make the decision.

19:01.840 --> 19:04.600
But good news, it's going to be babe box 3D when it's done.

19:04.600 --> 19:05.600
Hey, wait a minute.

19:05.600 --> 19:07.360
This ball is too big to fit through this hole.

19:07.360 --> 19:09.560
They rushed this through QA, man.

19:09.560 --> 19:11.080
This is bullshit.

19:11.080 --> 19:12.560
This box only has three flaps.

19:12.560 --> 19:13.560
What the fuck?

19:13.560 --> 19:16.920
The third flap, we're finishing the fourth one.

19:16.920 --> 19:17.920
It's art.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.280
You wouldn't get it.

19:19.280 --> 19:20.280
That's part of the experience.

19:20.280 --> 19:21.280
It's supposed to be challenging.

19:21.280 --> 19:37.760
It's weird.

19:37.760 --> 19:41.760
Before we start Haunted Dawn Lunch, I do need Paul to bring me another White Claw.

19:41.760 --> 19:44.160
Thank you, Paul.

19:44.160 --> 19:46.160
Let's see this beauty.

19:46.160 --> 19:49.840
Meet our first contestant, Justina.

19:49.840 --> 20:00.720
Justina, what you see is in a purple outfit with some rainbow sleeves and some face paint,

20:00.720 --> 20:04.120
which you'll find out comes by Honest.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.120
You're purchasing the doll pictured above.

20:06.120 --> 20:10.760
Are those two fingers holding her around the waist, or is that some sort of weird?

20:10.760 --> 20:11.760
Oh, boy.

20:11.760 --> 20:12.760
Oh, God.

20:12.760 --> 20:13.760
Holy shit.

20:13.760 --> 20:14.760
That sucks.

20:14.760 --> 20:16.120
I didn't even notice that.

20:16.120 --> 20:17.120
That sucks.

20:17.120 --> 20:20.720
It looks like E.T.'s trying to make a few bucks.

20:20.720 --> 20:27.160
It sucks.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.160
Meet Justina.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.640
Justina was in her late teens.

20:29.640 --> 20:30.800
Hold her like this.

20:30.800 --> 20:33.200
Do not use more than two fingers.

20:33.200 --> 20:34.560
Holy shit.

20:34.560 --> 20:35.560
Meet Justina.

20:35.560 --> 20:41.880
Normally, I should leave out the ones where they have the description of their deaths,

20:41.880 --> 20:46.880
but I have two that I do include that, because you'll see.

20:46.880 --> 20:47.880
Meet Justina.

20:47.880 --> 20:53.400
Justina was in her late 20s, working at a full-service laundromat.

20:53.400 --> 20:57.240
In her off time, she was a face painter for children's birthday parties.

20:57.240 --> 20:58.320
Not a very good one, it looks like.

20:58.320 --> 21:01.680
She was getting high on her own supply.

21:01.680 --> 21:06.840
She was happy, but always anxious to see what was in store for her.

21:06.840 --> 21:09.800
Did she break something in this picture?

21:09.800 --> 21:13.760
Is that a bulb of garlic on the bottom?

21:13.760 --> 21:16.800
It looks like prop bread.

21:16.800 --> 21:22.320
One day, while at work, a very strange and potent smell came on fast.

21:22.320 --> 21:26.360
It caused her and her coworkers to go unconscious.

21:26.360 --> 21:30.840
Around 10 minutes later, it had built up in the building, causing an explosion.

21:30.840 --> 21:36.240
Justina likes to watch soap operas and loves Slim Jims.

21:36.240 --> 21:43.520
That's the way it's written.

21:43.520 --> 21:47.680
The other people who worked there didn't get dolls.

21:47.680 --> 21:49.080
It caused an explosion.

21:49.080 --> 21:52.720
Justina likes to watch soap operas and loves Slim Jims.

21:52.720 --> 21:53.720
Do you?

21:53.720 --> 21:58.680
Okay, that may seem unrelated, but trust me, you'll see.

21:58.680 --> 22:01.880
Does she love them from an aesthetic point of view?

22:01.880 --> 22:04.880
It doesn't look like she has the apparatus.

22:04.880 --> 22:07.560
I eat the Slim Jims, Griffin.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.560
How?

22:08.560 --> 22:09.840
With my mouth.

22:09.840 --> 22:13.240
She communicates with dowsing rods, pendulum, and balloon lights.

22:13.240 --> 22:14.240
What?

22:14.240 --> 22:15.240
I don't know.

22:15.240 --> 22:22.200
Please do not adopt her if you have ill intentions, like trying to get free face paint.

22:22.200 --> 22:23.200
Please act-

22:23.200 --> 22:24.200
Wake up.

22:24.200 --> 22:25.200
Do a Spider-Man to me.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.200
Please act-

22:26.200 --> 22:29.600
No, I said send me a suit Spider-Man.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.960
Please ask questions before purchasing.

22:31.960 --> 22:34.080
I don't think you have that kind of time.

22:34.080 --> 22:39.560
Oh yeah, don't even act like she's not 12 inches tall.

22:39.560 --> 22:41.080
I have the proof.

22:41.080 --> 22:46.120
Also, if you need any loose sequins, I have a couple bags of them.

22:46.120 --> 22:50.560
I am selling a doll, not an experience.

22:50.560 --> 22:55.800
I am not responsible for any experience you may or may not have.

22:55.800 --> 22:57.680
That's a fun way of putting that.

22:57.680 --> 23:04.080
Please realize by adopting Justina, you are potentially inviting a spirit into your home.

23:04.080 --> 23:07.760
They are not toys and should only be handled by adults.

23:07.760 --> 23:10.800
Like this.

23:10.800 --> 23:13.160
With their two glowing fingers.

23:13.160 --> 23:18.440
That's a great 180 from like, I'm selling a doll, it's not a toy.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.880
Light a white candle to welcome her spirit.

23:20.880 --> 23:23.080
You will receive the doll pictured above.

23:23.080 --> 23:24.640
Anything else is a bonus.

23:24.640 --> 23:25.640
What?

23:25.640 --> 23:26.640
Whoa, I don't want-

23:26.640 --> 23:31.800
No, I see what kind of bric-a-brac you're working with.

23:31.800 --> 23:32.980
I'm good.

23:32.980 --> 23:36.000
I ask only adults purchase my dolls.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.200
I don't accept cancellations or issue refunds.

23:38.200 --> 23:40.840
I can't imagine why not.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.880
So that is Justina.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.520
Thanks for coming to the show, Justina.

23:44.520 --> 23:45.760
What a pleasure it was to have you.

23:45.760 --> 23:46.760
Happy to be here.

23:46.760 --> 23:51.600
Hey, can I just tell you all, I don't want to over-hype it, but you're going to love

23:51.600 --> 24:00.840
my new boy, Little Spitz.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.840
Let's meet Little Spitz.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.880
Oh yeah.

24:05.880 --> 24:08.160
That's Little Spitz, baby.

24:08.160 --> 24:12.120
Only $150?

24:12.120 --> 24:15.920
I'm going to watch this shit go up in real time.

24:15.920 --> 24:16.920
Little Spitz.

24:16.920 --> 24:19.920
Hey, what's up, guys?

24:19.920 --> 24:23.760
I'm Little Spitz, isn't I?

24:23.760 --> 24:29.120
Hey, they're starting to have some fun over here on Metaphysical eBay, okay?

24:29.120 --> 24:33.520
Little Spitz was a kid who wanted to be a rapper when he grew up.

24:33.520 --> 24:35.760
No, he did not.

24:35.760 --> 24:36.760
Yeah, he did.

24:36.760 --> 24:39.120
He was a doll his spirit in, idiot.

24:39.120 --> 24:44.040
He listened to all the classic rappers all the time, like Tupac and Eminem.

24:44.040 --> 24:48.840
He wrote his own raps.

24:48.840 --> 24:54.160
He made his own arms.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.520
He wrote his own raps.

24:55.520 --> 24:57.000
He made his own arms.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
And he would hang out.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.440
What can't Little Spitz do except clap?

25:01.440 --> 25:06.400
He wrote his own raps and would hang out with older kids who thought he was cool because

25:06.400 --> 25:08.160
he rapped.

25:08.160 --> 25:09.640
We've all been there.

25:09.640 --> 25:13.880
This ultimately got him killed as he was-

25:13.880 --> 25:18.800
Didn't see that coming, did you?

25:18.800 --> 25:23.240
Got him killed as he was with his group of friends and they decided to sneak out and

25:23.240 --> 25:27.520
go to a real rap battle.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.760
Are these three separate pictures?

25:29.760 --> 25:32.560
All posed like to give you a full idea.

25:32.560 --> 25:35.640
They thought it would be like 8 Mile.

25:35.640 --> 25:37.480
That's not me editorializing, that's what it says.

25:37.480 --> 25:39.440
They thought it would be like 8 Mile.

25:39.440 --> 25:43.220
While they were there on the edges of the crowd though, a car rolled up and a window

25:43.220 --> 25:47.800
rolled down.

25:47.800 --> 25:48.800
What are you saying?

25:48.800 --> 25:49.800
No, keep going.

25:49.800 --> 25:52.440
Hey y'all, an eight-year-old rap prodigy lost his life.

25:52.440 --> 25:59.360
If you could have a little decorum.

25:59.360 --> 26:02.760
While they were there on the edges of the crowd though, a car rolled up and a window

26:02.760 --> 26:08.880
rolled down, a barrel of a gun came out the window, and someone from the car yelled, Joy

26:08.880 --> 26:11.880
Road, bitches.

26:11.880 --> 26:13.440
Joy Road?

26:13.440 --> 26:20.840
Joy Road, bitches, and sprayed the crowd, presumably with bullets.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.720
With Axe Body spray.

26:22.720 --> 26:27.880
Lil Spitz was among the first hit with the bullets, not even understanding what happened.

26:27.880 --> 26:32.620
Now he is in this vessel, looking for someone cool and laid back.

26:32.620 --> 26:34.960
He said, that's me.

26:34.960 --> 26:39.640
Also someone who listens to rap music, or will at least play it for him.

26:39.640 --> 26:41.480
That's Lil Spitz.

26:41.480 --> 26:44.600
God almighty.

26:44.600 --> 26:50.440
This is our last item up on Metaphysical eBay, and we are branching out a little bit.

26:50.440 --> 26:51.440
Oh.

26:51.440 --> 26:52.440
All right.

26:52.440 --> 26:54.720
Tell me more, I've been in the market for one of these bad boys.

26:54.720 --> 27:01.640
Well this is a high-ranking Illuminati Freemason Cobra Ring Silver Antique Vintage Metaphysical.

27:01.640 --> 27:03.960
Wait, how is it metaphysical?

27:03.960 --> 27:08.600
Well, it's it because you're going to accept this ring into your life and experience wealth,

27:08.600 --> 27:11.120
comfort, power, influence, and all the very best things in life.

27:11.120 --> 27:13.560
Romance, love, comfort, and so much more.

27:13.560 --> 27:15.100
You truly can't have it all.

27:15.100 --> 27:17.020
That's why items like this exist.

27:17.020 --> 27:18.800
What's on either side of the snake?

27:18.800 --> 27:23.320
Well, Travis, being offered is a very rare, very powerful Freemasons ring that comes directly

27:23.320 --> 27:25.420
from the highest ranks of the Illuminati.

27:25.420 --> 27:29.960
Those who are the real heavy hitters, the real power holders of the Freemasons, those

27:29.960 --> 27:33.360
who make up half of the sacred inner circle of the New World Order.

27:33.360 --> 27:34.360
Okay.

27:34.360 --> 27:35.360
So Trav, let me tell you.

27:35.360 --> 27:36.960
Oh, and it's adjustable, which is nice.

27:36.960 --> 27:37.960
That is nice.

27:37.960 --> 27:41.080
You would think that they would have them fitted, but no.

27:41.080 --> 27:42.080
Who has the time?

27:42.080 --> 27:43.760
Also nice to see that they're hollow in the back.

27:43.760 --> 27:44.760
So you can store stuff.

27:44.760 --> 27:47.120
From the very moment you touch this piece, you'll realize you've purchased something

27:47.120 --> 27:51.160
truly extraordinary that will forever reverberate incredible power into your life.

27:51.160 --> 27:56.560
The aggressive power of this amazing ring has been created with forces of magic and

27:56.560 --> 28:00.800
other worldly technology, not only to, but a few of the most powerfully connected men

28:00.800 --> 28:01.800
on earth.

28:01.800 --> 28:05.520
If only Little Spitz had been wearing this ring when that drive-by happened.

28:05.520 --> 28:07.640
He would be protected.

28:07.640 --> 28:09.840
And other world technology couldn't make it fit?

28:09.840 --> 28:14.120
Fascinating sidebar, you may not know this, most do not, but the government of the United

28:14.120 --> 28:18.120
States possesses a memory copying technology, a medical device of sorts.

28:18.120 --> 28:19.520
Of sorts?

28:19.520 --> 28:23.360
Which is held at an underground nuclear metropolis in Roswell, New Mexico, long before it became

28:23.360 --> 28:24.360
Area 51.

28:24.360 --> 28:25.360
Sure.

28:25.360 --> 28:28.760
This process is parts of the brain that never dies, but rather simply shuts off when one

28:28.760 --> 28:29.760
dies.

28:29.760 --> 28:30.760
Yeah.

28:30.760 --> 28:33.920
This unusual technology turns it back on like a light switch and then siphons those memories,

28:33.920 --> 28:37.160
creating a memory archive for that particular individual.

28:37.160 --> 28:40.080
This wipes the memories of the brain so that no matter what medical, technological, or

28:40.080 --> 28:43.520
metaphysical advancements may arise in the future, nobody will ever be able to access

28:43.520 --> 28:46.200
the secret information within their memories except for them.

28:46.200 --> 28:51.120
This has been encoded within the memory archives of its Illuminati masters, the three men that

28:51.120 --> 28:56.320
make up half of the sacred inner circle of the New World Order at the time of its creation.

28:56.320 --> 28:57.320
Okay.

28:57.320 --> 28:59.680
That was an interesting sidebar.

28:59.680 --> 29:02.680
Yeah.

29:02.680 --> 29:07.080
This goes on for literally two pages.

29:07.080 --> 29:08.200
Yeah.

29:08.200 --> 29:11.440
There are no rituals or binding spells needed once your talisman arrives.

29:11.440 --> 29:12.440
Cool.

29:12.440 --> 29:14.200
This is completely ready for use.

29:14.200 --> 29:17.720
All that's needed is you accept this small magical offering into your life to keep it

29:17.720 --> 29:18.720
with you as much as possible.

29:18.720 --> 29:20.680
I mean, within reason.

29:20.680 --> 29:24.960
That's how I felt when my first daughter was born too, it's nice.

29:24.960 --> 29:29.320
You will have the know-how to anyone or anything that stands in your way of wealth and success.

29:29.320 --> 29:31.320
No level of magic will be able to hold you back in life.

29:31.320 --> 29:32.320
I mean, yeah.

29:32.320 --> 29:35.960
And it's 100% guaranteed satisfaction and fast delivery.

29:35.960 --> 29:36.960
So that's huge.

29:36.960 --> 29:39.920
You don't need to wait for this and it's available for just $80.

29:39.920 --> 29:40.920
Just $80, really?

29:40.920 --> 29:42.800
That's half the price of little spits.

29:42.800 --> 29:48.720
I mean- Imagine if you had both little spits and the Illuminati ring.

29:48.720 --> 29:49.720
Yes.

29:49.720 --> 29:51.720
An unkillable rap god.

29:51.720 --> 29:54.200
Hey, we are going to go use the bathroom.

29:54.200 --> 29:56.480
You should use the bathroom and we'll be right back with more jokes.

29:56.480 --> 29:57.480
We love you very much.

29:57.480 --> 29:58.480
Bye.

29:58.480 --> 29:59.480
Bye.

29:59.480 --> 30:00.480
Hello, my friends.

30:00.480 --> 30:03.480
I hope you're enjoying the episode.

30:03.480 --> 30:19.680
I don't know which one they decided to run, but I bet it was one of the good ones.

30:19.680 --> 30:20.680
Not that one.

30:20.680 --> 30:21.680
You know, it was kind of a dud.

30:21.680 --> 30:22.680
You probably heard a lot of people talking about it.

30:22.680 --> 30:23.680
I'm just kidding.

30:23.680 --> 30:24.680
They're all sevens because we're professionals.

30:24.680 --> 30:33.600
I want to tell you for a second, I want to talk to you about Imperfect Foods.

30:33.600 --> 30:38.600
You know, food waste is a big problem and we could all be doing a little bit more, but

30:38.600 --> 30:43.240
what if you could do more about the food waste problem and also help yourself too, my friends?

30:43.240 --> 30:47.880
That is what I like to call profitable altruism, which is a phrase I just invented, but I think

30:47.880 --> 30:50.120
it's really going somewhere.

30:50.120 --> 30:55.120
Imperfect Foods is the best route I can think of to do that.

30:55.120 --> 30:56.940
You can also save time in your grocery shopping.

30:56.940 --> 31:00.880
You can eat more fresh and delicious food and you're helping the planet.

31:00.880 --> 31:02.240
It's a slam dunk.

31:02.240 --> 31:06.560
It's a grocery delivery service that offers a whole line of sustainable groceries that

31:06.560 --> 31:10.040
embrace the natural imperfections in food.

31:10.040 --> 31:12.520
You know, we're all a little imperfect by definition.

31:12.520 --> 31:13.520
We're human beings.

31:13.520 --> 31:17.120
Don't you want that same value in your produce?

31:17.120 --> 31:18.320
This is fresh.

31:18.320 --> 31:19.320
It's delicious.

31:19.320 --> 31:23.040
It's just not exactly the perfect fit for the store shelves, but it may be the perfect

31:23.040 --> 31:28.640
fit for your home and Imperfect delivers weekly by neighborhood, which is a unique model.

31:28.640 --> 31:32.180
It produces 25 to 75% fewer emissions.

31:32.180 --> 31:34.040
Could this get any better for you or the planet?

31:34.040 --> 31:35.320
I think not.

31:35.320 --> 31:41.760
Imperfect Foods got me hooked into some really cool produce that I can't even get in my area.

31:41.760 --> 31:45.400
Things that are not available around here and some products I haven't heard of before,

31:45.400 --> 31:48.400
that have become absolute staples in my house.

31:48.400 --> 31:49.800
Try the croissant toast.

31:49.800 --> 31:54.200
Cannot recommend it enough if you want one easy slam dunk.

31:54.200 --> 31:58.420
Right now, Imperfect Foods is offering our listeners 20% off your first four orders when

31:58.420 --> 32:01.920
you go to ImperfectFoods.com and use promo code MYBROTHER.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.600
Again, 20% off your first four orders.

32:04.600 --> 32:07.240
That's up to an $80 value at ImperfectFoods.com.

32:07.240 --> 32:12.520
Offer code when you use the promo code MYBROTHER.

32:12.520 --> 32:17.240
And the movement at ImperfectFoods.com and use code MYBROTHER.

32:17.240 --> 32:22.640
While you're enjoying all your Imperfect Foods, you're going to be looking for some new hobbies.

32:22.640 --> 32:23.640
You have so much free time here.

32:23.640 --> 32:25.040
I don't go to the grocery store anymore.

32:25.040 --> 32:27.520
Why not try picking up a new language?

32:27.520 --> 32:36.000
I have been learning Japanese recently because someday I'd like to go to Tokyo Disneyland.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.840
There's other reasons, obviously, but I'm sorry.

32:39.840 --> 32:41.600
I am who I am.

32:41.600 --> 32:46.440
Babbel has 15-minute lessons that make it the perfect way to learn a new language on

32:46.440 --> 32:47.440
the go.

32:47.440 --> 32:54.000
With Babbel, you can choose from 14 different languages, Spanish, French, Italian, German,

32:54.000 --> 32:56.920
plus they have this speech recognition technology.

32:56.920 --> 32:59.280
It makes it easier to improve your pronunciation.

32:59.280 --> 33:06.400
It's a really, really fun, easy, accessible, effective way of learning a new language.

33:06.400 --> 33:13.600
Right now, save up to 60% off your subscription when you go to babbel.com slash my brother.

33:13.600 --> 33:20.400
That's B-A-B-B-E-L.com slash my brother for up to 60% off your subscription.

33:20.400 --> 33:23.000
Babbel, language for life.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
Quick bit of housekeeping.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
Thanks, by the way.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Thanks, obviously.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.960
Thank you for listening.

33:27.960 --> 33:33.320
Thanks to everybody who joined and upgraded during the Max Fun Drive.

33:33.320 --> 33:39.040
Just a reminder, we are in the midst of the Fancy Takes Flight Tour to celebrate 20 Rendez

33:39.040 --> 33:40.040
Vu.

33:40.040 --> 33:46.440
Tickets for all the shows are on sale now at bit.ly forward slash McElroy Tours, M-C-E-L-R-O-Y

33:46.440 --> 33:47.960
Tours.

33:47.960 --> 33:54.660
There's a virtual Adventure Zone next week on May 20th at 9pm ET.

33:54.660 --> 33:56.160
The game is Dread.

33:56.160 --> 33:57.960
It's going to be wild.

33:57.960 --> 34:02.700
Tickets are 10 bucks and the VOD, that's video on demand, is available for two weeks

34:02.700 --> 34:04.160
after the show.

34:04.160 --> 34:08.520
You want to see us live, in person, well, then you're going to head out to Boston on

34:08.520 --> 34:11.040
June 17th to see Taz.

34:11.040 --> 34:15.800
We're also in Boston June 18th with MBMBAM.

34:15.800 --> 34:20.840
And then on the 19th, we are in Mashantucket at the Foxwoods Casino June 19th with my brother.

34:20.840 --> 34:21.840
My brother and me.

34:21.840 --> 34:25.640
We're also coming to Salt Lake, Portland, San Diego, Washington, Detroit, Cincinnati.

34:25.640 --> 34:31.400
Now, mask and proof of full vaccination or negative COVID test within 72 hours of event

34:31.400 --> 34:33.040
start are required.

34:33.040 --> 34:37.600
Hey, our dad also has a book coming out this week or now.

34:37.600 --> 34:40.520
I mean, it's out on Tuesday, May 10th.

34:40.520 --> 34:48.040
So if you would like to have a great children's book to share with a kid in your life or just

34:48.040 --> 34:50.640
by yourself, you just want to enjoy it.

34:50.640 --> 34:54.760
It's called Goldie's Guide to Grandchilding and it is available in bookstores.

34:54.760 --> 34:58.600
We're going to be doing some appearances with dad throughout this great nation of ours.

34:58.600 --> 35:01.880
Go to Linktree slash Goldie's Guide.

35:01.880 --> 35:10.760
That's L-I-N-K-T-R dot E-E slash G-O-L-D-I-E-S guide to check in on that.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.440
Oh, this is fun.

35:12.440 --> 35:16.080
I don't want to spoil the surprise, but we are in a podcast with Batman.

35:16.080 --> 35:17.800
It's us and Batman fighting crime together.

35:17.800 --> 35:19.920
It's called Batman Unburied.

35:19.920 --> 35:26.120
It's a new podcast that drops new episodes Tuesday and it's exclusively for free on Spotify.

35:26.120 --> 35:31.880
It's made by Spotify, Warner Brothers and D.C. and is a thrilling take on the Caped

35:31.880 --> 35:32.880
Crusader.

35:32.880 --> 35:38.880
And we are in there with him, fighting alongside of him, basically.

35:38.880 --> 35:39.880
We have new merch too.

35:39.880 --> 35:42.600
You can check it all out at McElroy Merch dot com.

35:42.600 --> 35:47.240
And 10 percent of all merch proceeds this month are going to go to Naral.

35:47.240 --> 35:52.860
That is a group that fights for access to abortion care, birth control, paid parental

35:52.860 --> 35:55.880
leave and protections from pregnancy discrimination.

35:55.880 --> 35:57.360
That's all at McElroy Merch dot com.

35:57.360 --> 36:00.920
And do I have to do a celebrity impression now?

36:00.920 --> 36:04.720
OK, let's see if you can guess this one.

36:04.720 --> 36:08.440
I've been working on it.

36:08.440 --> 36:09.440
What?

36:09.440 --> 36:14.640
What's the deal with hummus?

36:14.640 --> 36:22.740
It's just mushed up beans and spices.

36:22.740 --> 36:26.420
Thank you so much to everyone who participated in this year's Max Fun Drive.

36:26.420 --> 36:30.560
If you're a member who wants to purchase additional patches, our annual shop is now

36:30.560 --> 36:31.560
live.

36:31.560 --> 36:35.000
The proceeds for this year's sale will be going to Trans Lifeline.

36:35.000 --> 36:39.560
Anytime is a good time to donate to Trans Lifeline, but this year it feels particularly

36:39.560 --> 36:41.080
important.

36:41.080 --> 36:45.760
Trans Lifeline is a non-profit for the trans community by the trans community.

36:45.760 --> 36:49.640
We're grateful that with your support, we'll be able to help Trans Lifeline connect trans

36:49.640 --> 36:53.920
folks to the support and resources they need to survive and thrive.

36:53.920 --> 36:57.420
The sale will run until Friday, May 20th.

36:57.420 --> 37:02.120
Folks at the $10 monthly level and above will have access to all of the patches from the

37:02.120 --> 37:03.200
drive.

37:03.200 --> 37:08.140
We also have a special network patch starring Nutsy that all members can purchase.

37:08.140 --> 37:12.900
For more information on Trans Lifeline, visit translifeline.org.

37:12.900 --> 37:19.920
And for more information on the patches, head to maximumfun.org slash patch sale.

37:19.920 --> 37:27.800
Hey, this is Alden Ford and Mujan Zofagari, and we are here with all the other creators

37:27.800 --> 37:28.800
of Mission to Zix.

37:28.800 --> 37:29.800
Hello.

37:29.800 --> 37:30.800
Hey.

37:30.800 --> 37:31.800
You're not going to say our names too?

37:31.800 --> 37:32.800
No, no.

37:32.800 --> 37:33.800
It's a short promo.

37:33.800 --> 37:34.800
Yeah.

37:34.800 --> 37:38.700
Now with the end of our fifth and final season just a few weeks away, we want to say thank

37:38.700 --> 37:43.640
you to Maximum Fun and to every single one of you who has listened to and supported Mission

37:43.640 --> 37:44.720
to Zix.

37:44.720 --> 37:45.720
Thank you.

37:45.720 --> 37:50.180
And if you haven't checked it out, well, Mission to Zix is an improvised space opera with blockbuster

37:50.180 --> 37:55.120
quality sound design, a score performed by an actual 60-piece orchestra, and hilarious

37:55.120 --> 37:57.180
guest comedians on every episode.

37:57.180 --> 38:02.620
And as our final episodes air, now is the perfect time to jump on board.

38:02.620 --> 38:12.500
It's Mission to Zix, Z-Y-X-X on Maximum Fun.

38:12.500 --> 38:19.460
How can I interest you gentlemen in a wager?

38:19.460 --> 38:20.460
Yes.

38:20.460 --> 38:24.900
It's time to play minion quotes.

38:24.900 --> 38:27.620
Yeah.

38:27.620 --> 38:31.100
But this time with a twist.

38:31.100 --> 38:36.740
So if you've never played this game, here are the rules.

38:36.740 --> 38:42.980
I Justin McElroy am going to read to you an inspirational or hilarious quote.

38:42.980 --> 38:49.700
That quote is attached in the memetic image that has been shared on Facebook by your aunt

38:49.700 --> 38:53.060
and it is connected to a cartoon character.

38:53.060 --> 38:55.940
That cartoon character will have to be guessed by my other two brothers if they guess it

38:55.940 --> 38:56.940
correctly.

38:56.940 --> 39:02.500
I will have to post this image, apropos of nothing, on my Facebook page.

39:02.500 --> 39:05.540
Now what makes this more interesting tonight is we are passing it around.

39:05.540 --> 39:09.720
We have each selected one quote so the stakes are higher than ever because all three of

39:09.720 --> 39:12.460
us are participating in the game.

39:12.460 --> 39:18.820
Oh, also I just realized in a second, another twist, I've been locked out of my Facebook

39:18.820 --> 39:22.500
for the past like three weeks because of like, I don't know, because I haven't logged in

39:22.500 --> 39:25.540
long enough and they're worried about it and I was like, oh cool, I don't ever have to

39:25.540 --> 39:26.900
go on Facebook again.

39:26.900 --> 39:30.620
So if I lose, I have to figure that out.

39:30.620 --> 39:31.620
Your brand reemerges.

39:31.620 --> 39:32.620
Yes.

39:32.620 --> 39:33.620
Okay.

39:33.620 --> 39:34.620
Okay.

39:34.620 --> 39:35.620
Are you ready to play minion quotes?

39:35.620 --> 39:36.620
I'm so fucking ready.

39:36.620 --> 39:37.620
Oh, mine.

39:37.620 --> 39:38.620
Okay, great.

39:38.620 --> 39:39.620
Oh, Travis is first.

39:39.620 --> 39:40.620
I thought you said I'm first.

39:40.620 --> 39:41.620
Travis is first.

39:41.620 --> 39:42.620
Travis is first.

39:42.620 --> 39:43.620
Okay.

39:43.620 --> 39:44.620
Okay.

39:44.620 --> 39:45.620
I'm not looking at your phone.

39:45.620 --> 39:51.620
The quote is, I don't care how difficult 2019 has been, but the fact we woke up every day

39:51.620 --> 39:58.420
means that God isn't finished with us, which I think is supposed to be inspirational, but

39:58.420 --> 40:00.900
could also be horrifyingly threatening.

40:00.900 --> 40:01.900
Yeah.

40:01.900 --> 40:08.100
Knowing what happens in 2020, it does sound like God is threatening us from a distance.

40:08.100 --> 40:14.460
The religious ones are tough because usually it is not who you would think of as being

40:14.460 --> 40:17.140
a particularly religious cartoon character.

40:17.140 --> 40:21.780
And I would argue the highest stakes ones to pick as the picker, yes.

40:21.780 --> 40:22.780
Yeah.

40:22.780 --> 40:23.780
Oh, wow.

40:23.780 --> 40:24.780
I really want to get this right.

40:24.780 --> 40:25.780
Yeah.

40:25.780 --> 40:28.580
I live life on the edge.

40:28.580 --> 40:29.580
Can I have a hint?

40:29.580 --> 40:30.580
No.

40:30.580 --> 40:31.580
Maybe just one hint?

40:31.580 --> 40:32.580
Oh, okay.

40:32.580 --> 40:34.620
It's a cartoon character.

40:34.620 --> 40:37.620
Damn it.

40:37.620 --> 40:40.500
It's a cartoon character.

40:40.500 --> 40:43.500
Can I ask a question, yes or no, and you have to answer honestly?

40:43.500 --> 40:46.540
Oh, you can ask the question and we'll see.

40:46.540 --> 40:49.340
Is it a Looney Tune?

40:49.340 --> 40:50.340
That's a big swash.

40:50.340 --> 40:51.340
Tweety Bird.

40:51.340 --> 40:52.340
I'm saying Tweety Bird.

40:52.340 --> 40:53.340
Tweety Bird, Tweety Bird.

40:53.340 --> 40:54.340
I'm going to say Bugs Bunny.

40:54.340 --> 40:55.340
It's a classic.

40:55.340 --> 40:56.340
I'm sorry.

40:56.340 --> 41:09.220
Paul, if we could swap it, it is Moana.

41:09.220 --> 41:12.740
I should have considered the coconut.

41:12.740 --> 41:13.740
That was my bad.

41:13.740 --> 41:20.340
What, you know how Moana has a close and personal relationship with the Christian deity?

41:20.340 --> 41:22.780
You know how famously that's what the movie is about?

41:22.780 --> 41:23.780
Okay, now wait.

41:23.780 --> 41:24.780
Now hold on.

41:24.780 --> 41:25.780
Now I'm mad.

41:25.780 --> 41:27.300
She literally meets a god of a different religion.

41:27.300 --> 41:28.780
Like she meets a god.

41:28.780 --> 41:29.780
Correct.

41:29.780 --> 41:30.780
Correct.

41:30.780 --> 41:31.780
A Demi-God, but still.

41:31.780 --> 41:34.420
Well, I mean then, Te Fiti?

41:34.420 --> 41:35.420
It's a huge part of the movie.

41:35.420 --> 41:40.260
Yeah, and she's interacting with religious figures outside of the Christian experience.

41:40.260 --> 41:41.260
Yeah.

41:41.260 --> 41:46.460
Yeah, but our God's not done with her.

41:46.460 --> 41:50.980
Our God, the one true God, Father of Abraham.

41:50.980 --> 41:55.460
Hey, do you ever have a moment where you're like, oh, all the Southern Baptist isn't out

41:55.460 --> 41:56.460
yet?

41:56.460 --> 41:57.460
Oh no.

41:57.460 --> 41:58.460
The Lamb of Judea.

41:58.460 --> 41:59.460
Okay.

41:59.460 --> 42:02.100
Could beat the shit out of the Rock's Mouth.

42:02.100 --> 42:05.700
All right, Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.

42:05.700 --> 42:08.540
Okay, this is Justin's minion quote.

42:08.540 --> 42:09.540
Okay.

42:09.540 --> 42:11.940
Paul, it would be easier if you just put the quote on the screen.

42:11.940 --> 42:13.220
I can just read off of that.

42:13.220 --> 42:17.620
Remember how when you were little, you could just rip off your diaper and run around naked

42:17.620 --> 42:20.180
and everyone thought it was so cute and funny.

42:20.180 --> 42:22.740
Anyway, I need bail money.

42:22.740 --> 42:25.820
Fuck, that's funny.

42:25.820 --> 42:27.260
God.

42:27.260 --> 42:32.740
So I am going to, because it occurs to me that I slightly cheated.

42:32.740 --> 42:37.300
So I am going to tell you, it is not a cartoon character.

42:37.300 --> 42:38.300
Oh.

42:38.300 --> 42:45.900
But it is a children's character, not a cartoon character.

42:45.900 --> 42:48.660
Is it Moana again?

42:48.660 --> 42:51.820
Now Bud, Bud, that's a cartoon, remember?

42:51.820 --> 42:52.820
We just saw it.

42:52.820 --> 42:56.660
I want to say Blippi, but I know you wouldn't do that to us.

42:56.660 --> 43:05.300
I don't think boomers know who Blippi is and this has big boomer energy.

43:05.300 --> 43:06.460
Is it children's?

43:06.460 --> 43:11.420
A children's character for children's, but not a cartoon.

43:11.420 --> 43:12.420
Family character.

43:12.420 --> 43:13.420
Everybody can enjoy this character.

43:13.420 --> 43:14.420
God, I've said too much.

43:14.420 --> 43:15.420
Okay.

43:15.420 --> 43:16.420
I'm going to shut up.

43:16.420 --> 43:17.420
Can I ask one yes or no question?

43:17.420 --> 43:19.980
I've already given you all the clues you need, Mr. Policeman.

43:19.980 --> 43:21.260
Is it a human character?

43:21.260 --> 43:26.300
Also, we referenced that Snowman movie a lot for three people who haven't seen it.

43:26.300 --> 43:28.820
I barely seen the poster.

43:28.820 --> 43:29.820
Is it a human character?

43:29.820 --> 43:32.320
I mean, it's an interesting question.

43:32.320 --> 43:34.460
That you'll answer now.

43:34.460 --> 43:36.900
Come on, it won't be funny if nobody gets it.

43:36.900 --> 43:42.900
Yeah, but of the people on this stage, I think I have the least appropriate tribute.

43:42.900 --> 43:46.220
The least appropriate sacrifice is I am the only one who's had to do this.

43:46.220 --> 43:48.260
No, it's not a human character.

43:48.260 --> 43:49.260
Yes.

43:49.260 --> 43:50.260
Okay.

43:50.260 --> 43:51.260
That's tough.

43:51.260 --> 43:55.520
Do you have a guess, Travis?

43:55.520 --> 43:57.780
I'm going to say Paddington.

43:57.780 --> 43:58.780
You really need?

43:58.780 --> 43:59.780
Okay, Paddington.

43:59.780 --> 44:00.780
Interesting.

44:00.780 --> 44:04.020
It's not fucking Paddington.

44:04.020 --> 44:09.460
I'm trying to think of the other deep wells that we usually draw from, and by we, I mean

44:09.460 --> 44:12.500
boomers who put up memes on Facebook.

44:12.500 --> 44:13.500
Think really hard.

44:13.500 --> 44:14.980
I think you can do it.

44:14.980 --> 44:15.980
Really?

44:15.980 --> 44:20.740
A live action non-human that boomers would know.

44:20.740 --> 44:21.740
Is it Kermit?

44:21.740 --> 44:22.740
Yes!

44:22.740 --> 44:47.340
I knew you could do it.

44:47.340 --> 44:51.180
Now Justin, do you want to wait?

44:51.180 --> 44:52.980
Do you want to wait until Griffin's?

44:52.980 --> 44:55.180
No, we're going to sit right here, everyone.

44:55.180 --> 45:01.940
I'm just going to put it on my Facebook right now, because it's not fun unless I do it right

45:01.940 --> 45:02.940
now.

45:02.940 --> 45:05.140
And I will then immediately comment on it.

45:05.140 --> 45:09.580
Oh no, my Facebook's locked!

45:09.580 --> 45:11.140
Do you want to load mine up while Justin?

45:11.140 --> 45:13.500
Oh, you got that hair trigger.

45:13.500 --> 45:15.380
He already had the image loaded.

45:15.380 --> 45:16.380
Okay.

45:16.380 --> 45:19.940
Hold on, I want to put a link to Sydney's website on here.

45:19.940 --> 45:22.540
Yeah, I'm sure she'll love that.

45:22.540 --> 45:25.500
Oh, he's doing it.

45:25.500 --> 45:29.580
Okay, here is my minion quote.

45:29.580 --> 45:30.580
Oh boy.

45:30.580 --> 45:32.220
Hold on, devil.

45:32.220 --> 45:34.900
Not today, or any other day.

45:34.900 --> 45:37.540
Feeling blessed and covered under the blood of Jesus.

45:37.540 --> 45:41.780
Like, share, and type, amen.

45:41.780 --> 45:42.820
Wow.

45:42.820 --> 45:47.140
Now this is your first time playing, right?

45:47.140 --> 45:48.140
Yes.

45:48.140 --> 45:54.060
I also, in full disclosure, I don't know where you find these, but I was looking around for

45:54.060 --> 46:01.680
minion quotes, and I found one on the MBMBAM reddit that somebody posted on there.

46:01.680 --> 46:03.700
So thank you for doing that hard work.

46:03.700 --> 46:07.580
So same question, is this a cartoon character?

46:07.580 --> 46:09.580
This is a cartoon character.

46:09.580 --> 46:11.420
Is it a Looney Tune?

46:11.420 --> 46:14.740
That's such, that's so- You, I gave you-

46:14.740 --> 46:17.420
It's not a Looney- You see this, right?

46:17.420 --> 46:18.420
It's a cartoon character.

46:18.420 --> 46:19.420
You see this.

46:19.420 --> 46:21.940
You're right, you should be able to get your revenge.

46:21.940 --> 46:24.500
It is a cartoon character, it is not a Looney Tune.

46:24.500 --> 46:27.340
I will not give you anything else.

46:27.340 --> 46:28.340
Bart Simpson.

46:28.340 --> 46:29.340
No.

46:29.340 --> 46:34.540
Oh, he gave us nothing there, that was a cold, dead stare from Griffin.

46:34.540 --> 46:36.120
Okay, Justin.

46:36.120 --> 46:38.300
Not a Simpson character.

46:38.300 --> 46:39.300
It's not a Ralphie.

46:39.300 --> 46:41.420
Okay, let me hear your guesses.

46:41.420 --> 46:44.420
Not, what?

46:44.420 --> 46:50.300
Alvin, from Alvin and the Chipmunks.

46:50.300 --> 46:51.300
No.

46:51.300 --> 46:57.060
I do want the audience to keep yelling, though, because I honestly haven't-

46:57.060 --> 47:01.940
Scooby-Doo I heard, which will be a wild- No, I haven't heard it.

47:01.940 --> 47:05.300
Shrek, just reveal it.

47:05.300 --> 47:07.500
It's fucking Fred Flintstone.

47:07.500 --> 47:22.060
Now, Devril, pretty sure that the Flintstones universe is like wicked BC, like super duper

47:22.060 --> 47:25.380
duper BC.

47:25.380 --> 47:27.740
Back in the time when man and dinosaur lived together.

47:27.740 --> 47:28.740
Really, Amanda?

47:28.740 --> 47:30.500
Amanda's already commented on my Facebook page.

47:30.500 --> 47:32.860
Don't you have work to do, Amanda?

47:32.860 --> 47:33.860
You're getting a raise.

47:33.860 --> 47:37.020
Anticipating our needs.

47:37.020 --> 47:38.020
So that's MinionQuotes.

47:38.020 --> 47:39.020
Oh, boy.

47:39.020 --> 47:43.100
All right.

47:43.100 --> 47:48.460
So we asked you all to send in questions that we could answer live, and we have some people

47:48.460 --> 47:49.460
picked out.

47:49.460 --> 47:51.020
Where's the microphone at?

47:51.020 --> 47:55.020
I was in the bathroom during the soundcheck, so I don't actually know.

47:55.020 --> 47:58.300
So we're going to call down two at a time- Can we get the house lights up just like 20%?

47:58.300 --> 48:02.460
Can we go back to the part where Griffin said he was in the bathroom for both soundchecks?

48:02.460 --> 48:05.380
Because I feel like that you didn't let it sink in.

48:05.380 --> 48:06.380
Where is it?

48:06.380 --> 48:07.380
It's right there.

48:07.380 --> 48:08.380
It's right there.

48:08.380 --> 48:09.380
I'm playing Where's Waldo with this microphone.

48:09.380 --> 48:10.380
Okay.

48:10.380 --> 48:11.380
Yes.

48:11.380 --> 48:12.380
Hello.

48:12.380 --> 48:13.380
Hello.

48:13.380 --> 48:14.380
Hello and welcome.

48:14.380 --> 48:15.380
Hi.

48:15.380 --> 48:16.380
Hi.

48:16.380 --> 48:17.380
I'm Taylor.

48:17.380 --> 48:18.380
Hi, Taylor.

48:18.380 --> 48:19.380
Hi, Taylor.

48:19.380 --> 48:27.300
Taylor, your question- I can't believe we picked this one.

48:27.300 --> 48:28.820
Taylor asked, who are you?

48:28.820 --> 48:37.980
I'm just here because I bought the tickets.

48:37.980 --> 48:44.500
So I guess we were actually, we read this backstage and we thought, I wonder how it's

48:44.500 --> 48:45.500
going.

48:45.500 --> 48:46.500
Yeah.

48:46.500 --> 48:50.060
So we wanted to ask you, Taylor, what do you think so far?

48:50.060 --> 48:51.540
And really give us the real shit.

48:51.540 --> 48:53.100
Please be honest with us, Taylor.

48:53.100 --> 48:54.660
Like what do you think so far?

48:54.660 --> 48:56.140
I think it's pretty good so far.

48:56.140 --> 48:57.140
Yeah.

48:57.140 --> 48:59.140
I think it's pretty good so far.

48:59.140 --> 49:01.420
Now, Taylor, I have a follow-up question.

49:01.420 --> 49:06.020
When you say, I'm just here because I bought the tickets on accident?

49:06.020 --> 49:09.220
No, my sibling's actually here with me.

49:09.220 --> 49:10.220
Oh, okay.

49:10.220 --> 49:11.660
What's your sibling's name?

49:11.660 --> 49:12.660
Rhiannon.

49:12.660 --> 49:13.660
Hi, Rhiannon.

49:13.660 --> 49:14.660
Hello.

49:14.660 --> 49:15.660
And Rhiannon knows who we are, right?

49:15.660 --> 49:16.660
Yes.

49:16.660 --> 49:17.660
Oh, okay.

49:17.660 --> 49:18.660
It's a very early birthday present for them.

49:18.660 --> 49:19.660
Oh, happy early birthday.

49:19.660 --> 49:20.660
Okay.

49:20.660 --> 49:21.660
Now, have you picked a favorite yet?

49:21.660 --> 49:22.660
Oh, good question.

49:22.660 --> 49:27.660
Well, I'm a little biased because I'm on Tumblr a lot, so I see Griffin's face a lot, so.

49:27.660 --> 49:28.660
Oh, my God.

49:28.660 --> 49:36.180
I will be feasting off the memory of you hesitating to remember his name for a week.

49:36.180 --> 49:37.180
Yeah, that was decadent.

49:37.180 --> 49:39.780
But you did pull it, Taylor, so don't feel bad.

49:39.780 --> 49:40.780
Yay.

49:40.780 --> 49:41.780
You did pull it.

49:41.780 --> 49:42.780
Yeah, you did pull it.

49:42.780 --> 49:43.780
Garf-ball.

49:43.780 --> 49:44.780
What is it?

49:44.780 --> 49:45.780
Garf-ball.

49:45.780 --> 49:46.780
Garf-ball.

49:46.780 --> 49:47.780
That's a Garfield...

49:47.780 --> 49:48.780
Dresses Garf-ball?

49:48.780 --> 49:49.780
Garf-ball.

49:49.780 --> 49:56.020
That's a completely unnecessary self-own, but which of my many incredible memes that have

49:56.020 --> 49:57.020
made it onto Tumblr?

49:57.020 --> 50:01.500
The main one I see is, like, you holding a blank piece of paper, and people edit.

50:01.500 --> 50:02.500
Oh, edit.

50:02.500 --> 50:06.380
I think my favorite one is somebody saying, I'm too afraid to...

50:06.380 --> 50:08.580
I don't know who the McElroy brothers are, and I'm too afraid to ask with your face.

50:08.580 --> 50:09.580
Did you make that one?

50:09.580 --> 50:10.580
Or...

50:10.580 --> 50:11.580
Wait, no, Taylor wasn't afraid.

50:11.580 --> 50:12.580
Yeah.

50:12.580 --> 50:13.580
Taylor asked.

50:13.580 --> 50:14.580
I saw that one.

50:14.580 --> 50:15.580
I did not make it.

50:15.580 --> 50:16.580
You did ask who we are.

50:16.580 --> 50:17.580
Yeah.

50:17.580 --> 50:18.580
And that's what's...

50:18.580 --> 50:19.580
That's all that's important.

50:19.580 --> 50:21.220
We're like brothers, and we do, like, advice.

50:21.220 --> 50:22.220
That's the show, basically.

50:22.220 --> 50:23.220
Yeah.

50:23.220 --> 50:24.220
And we do, like, strong.

50:24.220 --> 50:25.220
Skits.

50:25.220 --> 50:26.220
We're strong.

50:26.220 --> 50:31.320
Yeah, we're strong and capable fellows.

50:31.320 --> 50:33.340
We're strong and we have normal digestive systems.

50:33.340 --> 50:34.340
Those are the two things.

50:34.340 --> 50:37.440
That's exactly what I got from everything you guys have said so far.

50:37.440 --> 50:38.440
You're getting that.

50:38.440 --> 50:39.440
Okay, perfect.

50:39.440 --> 50:42.300
We eat bananas totally normal.

50:42.300 --> 50:43.940
And...

50:43.940 --> 50:48.940
Um, well, we, Taylor, we've embarrassed you now.

50:49.340 --> 50:50.900
Thank you so much for being a good sport.

50:50.900 --> 50:51.740
Thanks for coming.

50:51.740 --> 50:52.580
I hope you're having fun.

50:52.580 --> 50:53.420
Yeah.

50:53.420 --> 50:54.240
Yeah.

50:54.240 --> 50:55.080
Yeah.

50:55.080 --> 50:55.920
Yeah.

50:55.920 --> 50:56.740
Yeah.

50:56.740 --> 50:57.580
Yeah.

50:57.580 --> 50:58.420
Hi.

50:58.420 --> 50:59.240
Hi.

50:59.240 --> 51:00.080
Who, who are you?

51:00.080 --> 51:00.920
We've called so many names.

51:00.920 --> 51:01.760
Okay.

51:01.760 --> 51:02.580
I'm Lauren.

51:02.580 --> 51:03.420
Hi, Lauren.

51:03.420 --> 51:04.260
Hi, Lauren.

51:04.260 --> 51:07.420
You asked us, uh, failed my driver's test today.

51:07.420 --> 51:10.020
How could I impress the examiner next time?

51:10.020 --> 51:10.860
Yeah.

51:10.860 --> 51:12.380
How bad'd you fail?

51:12.380 --> 51:14.180
I drove on the wrong side of the road.

51:14.180 --> 51:15.020
I mean-

51:15.020 --> 51:15.860
Whoa!

51:15.860 --> 51:17.540
Hey, Lauren.

51:17.540 --> 51:19.620
Very British.

51:19.620 --> 51:20.460
Very British, Lauren.

51:20.460 --> 51:21.460
I know the first impressive thing

51:21.460 --> 51:23.620
you could do next time, Lauren.

51:24.580 --> 51:27.340
For like a long time?

51:27.340 --> 51:28.740
No.

51:28.740 --> 51:32.660
Well, Griffin, how long do you think it needs to happen

51:32.660 --> 51:33.500
before it's a no?

51:33.500 --> 51:36.020
Hey, hey, Lauren, uh, can you replicate

51:36.020 --> 51:38.700
what they said to you in exact replica?

51:38.700 --> 51:40.060
Like tone of voice, too.

51:40.060 --> 51:40.900
Yeah.

51:40.900 --> 51:43.180
Um, she waited until I was done with my test

51:43.180 --> 51:44.700
and then she was like, unfortunately,

51:44.700 --> 51:45.900
you drove on the wrong side of the road,

51:45.900 --> 51:47.300
which is an automatic fail.

51:47.300 --> 51:48.120
Damn.

51:48.120 --> 51:48.960
Whoa!

51:48.960 --> 51:49.800
She made you keep going?

51:49.800 --> 51:51.140
Yeah, she should have said something

51:51.140 --> 51:51.980
when you ran over like 80 people.

51:51.980 --> 51:52.820
When you were doing it,

51:52.820 --> 51:55.420
when she was just like, hell yeah, fuck, let's go.

51:55.420 --> 51:57.500
Yes, yes, this is how I do it.

51:57.500 --> 51:58.380
Yes, go!

51:58.380 --> 52:00.260
I'm feeling something for the first time.

52:00.260 --> 52:01.080
This is li-

52:01.080 --> 52:01.920
This is living.

52:01.920 --> 52:02.860
I'm alive.

52:02.860 --> 52:04.180
Hold my hand, Lauren.

52:04.180 --> 52:05.900
Lauren, are you feeling this?

52:05.900 --> 52:10.380
Um, the word that I feel like

52:10.380 --> 52:13.180
made us select this question was,

52:13.180 --> 52:15.940
how could I impress the examiner next time?

52:15.940 --> 52:20.460
And I'm not sure you understand

52:20.460 --> 52:23.220
what the examiner is looking for.

52:23.220 --> 52:27.580
It's not America's Got Talent driving edition.

52:27.580 --> 52:29.380
You already tried stunting,

52:29.380 --> 52:31.420
so let's mark that one off.

52:32.340 --> 52:33.180
Next.

52:33.180 --> 52:35.140
Oh, super cool car.

52:35.140 --> 52:37.520
They can't flunk you for knowing all the words

52:37.520 --> 52:39.320
to Barenaked Ladies one week.

52:39.320 --> 52:42.440
They can't, they legally can't flunk you

52:42.440 --> 52:45.560
if you sing the fast part from Hook by Blues Traveler.

52:45.560 --> 52:46.400
Yeah.

52:47.400 --> 52:48.240
On loop.

52:50.680 --> 52:51.520
Was that it?

52:51.520 --> 52:53.600
Was it just driving the wrong lane that they didn't?

52:53.600 --> 52:54.440
Cause that's an easy fix.

52:54.440 --> 52:56.080
Is that not enough?

52:56.080 --> 52:58.580
No, I'm saying you just don't do that next time

52:58.580 --> 53:00.260
and you should be good.

53:00.260 --> 53:01.260
Or were there other rules?

53:01.260 --> 53:04.760
Cause we're real like gear heads.

53:04.760 --> 53:05.760
Oh, you know what?

53:05.760 --> 53:08.040
Everybody does parallel parking on their test.

53:08.040 --> 53:09.640
Do some perpendicular parking.

53:09.640 --> 53:11.280
Yes.

53:11.280 --> 53:13.320
That'll blow them away.

53:13.320 --> 53:15.400
I'm doing concentric parking.

53:17.080 --> 53:19.180
My parallel parking actually went really well,

53:19.180 --> 53:21.640
but that's not good enough apparently.

53:21.640 --> 53:22.480
Yeah.

53:24.720 --> 53:25.560
Now, Lauren, you could-

53:25.560 --> 53:27.040
I think it sucks because like,

53:28.000 --> 53:29.400
they shouldn't fail you cause like,

53:29.400 --> 53:31.400
what are the odds that you'll do that again?

53:31.400 --> 53:32.800
Yeah.

53:32.800 --> 53:34.560
And also the fact that you did that

53:34.560 --> 53:36.240
and they knew you'd failed and they're like,

53:36.240 --> 53:38.520
and you still have to parallel park.

53:38.520 --> 53:40.280
Yeah, that sucks actually.

53:40.280 --> 53:41.640
They should've let you go home.

53:41.640 --> 53:44.760
Did they keep writing stuff down on the paper?

53:44.760 --> 53:47.040
Cause that's a wild part of the grift.

53:47.040 --> 53:48.520
Yeah, did you see them?

53:48.520 --> 53:51.880
Did you see them casually put the clipboard on the floor?

53:51.880 --> 53:53.480
I needed that.

53:53.480 --> 53:54.980
I won't be needing this.

53:56.860 --> 53:59.040
No, but there are just like some random scribbles

53:59.040 --> 53:59.880
on the paper.

53:59.880 --> 54:00.880
So I think she was trying to like,

54:00.880 --> 54:02.240
make me think I had some hope.

54:02.240 --> 54:03.640
Yeah.

54:03.640 --> 54:05.840
How long do you have to wait before you can take it again?

54:05.840 --> 54:06.800
A week.

54:06.800 --> 54:07.640
One week.

54:07.640 --> 54:08.480
That is not very long.

54:08.480 --> 54:11.200
It's been one week since I failed my test.

54:11.200 --> 54:13.160
Drove on the wrong side of the road.

54:14.600 --> 54:17.480
If, when you go back, you have the same tester,

54:17.480 --> 54:18.440
spend the whole time,

54:18.440 --> 54:20.040
anytime you're on the right side of the road,

54:20.040 --> 54:22.040
say like, I don't know if you noticed.

54:24.040 --> 54:26.800
Many people would choose that side of the road,

54:26.800 --> 54:27.840
but not me.

54:27.840 --> 54:29.520
An obvious mistake.

54:29.520 --> 54:30.360
Clearly.

54:30.360 --> 54:33.960
I'm not zooming into the front of the other cars.

54:33.960 --> 54:37.520
Notice how me and the other driver pass by each other

54:37.520 --> 54:39.480
without incident.

54:39.480 --> 54:41.240
You're welcome.

54:41.240 --> 54:43.560
Does that help?

54:43.560 --> 54:44.520
I think.

54:44.520 --> 54:45.640
You're going to do it next time.

54:45.640 --> 54:46.640
Yeah, you got it.

54:46.640 --> 54:48.280
We believe in Lauren, right?

54:48.280 --> 54:49.120
Thank you.

54:54.440 --> 54:56.400
Hey, my name is Ellie.

54:56.400 --> 54:57.240
Hi Ellie.

54:57.240 --> 54:58.680
Griffin, you're really putting yourself through a lot

54:58.680 --> 55:00.640
of struggle to not burp right there.

55:00.640 --> 55:02.320
Sorry.

55:02.320 --> 55:04.120
Contortions.

55:04.120 --> 55:04.960
Hello Ellie.

55:04.960 --> 55:06.440
Hi.

55:06.440 --> 55:07.280
How you doing?

55:07.280 --> 55:08.120
Good.

55:08.120 --> 55:08.960
I'm doing great.

55:08.960 --> 55:09.800
Thank you for asking.

55:09.800 --> 55:10.640
Yeah.

55:10.640 --> 55:12.320
You asked, I work at a haunted cave

55:12.320 --> 55:14.480
that is said to have 30 to 40 ghosts,

55:14.480 --> 55:16.720
but I haven't had a ghost experience yet.

55:16.720 --> 55:18.160
How do I trigger one?

55:19.120 --> 55:20.480
Yeah.

55:20.480 --> 55:23.280
I work at the Wabasha street caves in St. Paul.

55:23.280 --> 55:24.120
Yes.

55:26.480 --> 55:30.960
There's fans and every tour guide has had like things move.

55:30.960 --> 55:33.880
They've seen people, they've heard bands.

55:33.880 --> 55:34.720
Definitely.

55:34.720 --> 55:35.560
They've heard what?

55:35.560 --> 55:36.400
Bands.

55:36.400 --> 55:37.960
We have big bands that play and-

55:37.960 --> 55:38.800
Ghost bands?

55:38.800 --> 55:40.960
Wait, big bands or big bands?

55:42.040 --> 55:43.200
Like big names or-

55:43.200 --> 55:45.120
Like Glenn Miller orchestra style big bands

55:45.120 --> 55:45.960
or just like large bands?

55:45.960 --> 55:49.560
Like Cab Calloway, like Benny Goodman and stuff.

55:49.560 --> 55:50.400
Wait, hold on.

55:50.400 --> 55:51.840
Wait, shut.

55:51.840 --> 55:52.680
Wait.

55:52.680 --> 55:54.400
Your caves are pulling Cab Calloway?

55:54.400 --> 55:56.160
Yeah, that's a huge ghost git.

55:56.160 --> 55:57.000
Apparently.

55:57.840 --> 56:00.440
Can I say if I was going to have a ghost experience,

56:00.440 --> 56:01.400
if it was totally legit,

56:01.400 --> 56:04.200
I would also experience a Cab Calloway concert.

56:04.200 --> 56:05.040
Yeah.

56:05.040 --> 56:07.360
Apparently John Dillinger is also around sometimes.

56:07.360 --> 56:08.200
Wow.

56:08.200 --> 56:09.040
Okay.

56:09.040 --> 56:09.880
Wow.

56:09.880 --> 56:11.400
Well, he's not busy haunting other places.

56:11.400 --> 56:13.360
What's so dope about your caves

56:13.360 --> 56:15.840
that makes every ghost wanna be there?

56:15.840 --> 56:17.960
Three people were murdered there.

56:17.960 --> 56:20.280
Well, then there should be three ghosts.

56:20.280 --> 56:21.720
Yes.

56:21.720 --> 56:24.200
Ellie, these other sightings

56:24.200 --> 56:25.680
that the other tour guides have had,

56:25.680 --> 56:28.120
are these things that they've told you in confidence

56:28.120 --> 56:29.280
or are these things that they say

56:29.280 --> 56:31.760
when they're giving tours of the caves?

56:31.760 --> 56:34.800
So both, and they have pictures to prove it.

56:34.800 --> 56:35.640
What?

56:36.640 --> 56:39.720
Like not just orbs, like actual pictures of-

56:39.720 --> 56:41.440
We've got a fucking scoop.

56:41.440 --> 56:42.600
Hold on, wait.

56:42.600 --> 56:45.480
Not just orbs.

56:45.480 --> 56:47.840
As if someone came to me and was like,

56:47.840 --> 56:49.360
yeah, I work at this cave.

56:49.360 --> 56:51.520
Check out this fucking orb I saw.

56:51.520 --> 56:54.120
I'd be like, just an orb?

56:55.880 --> 56:56.720
Yeah.

56:56.720 --> 56:57.960
So you're saying they have a picture

56:57.960 --> 56:59.920
of like them in Cab Calloway.

57:01.320 --> 57:06.320
Hey, Ellie, like if your coworkers have pictures of ghosts,

57:06.320 --> 57:08.800
that should be all you're sort of thinking

57:08.800 --> 57:10.280
and talking about.

57:10.280 --> 57:12.280
Like in your life, your questions should be like,

57:12.280 --> 57:15.120
my fucking coworkers have pictures of ghosts.

57:15.120 --> 57:15.960
What do I do with that?

57:15.960 --> 57:19.360
And not just fucking bullshit orbs.

57:21.080 --> 57:23.480
Real human-shaped ghosts.

57:23.480 --> 57:25.960
Juicy three-dimensional ghosts.

57:25.960 --> 57:27.280
Like we have one of an old lady

57:27.280 --> 57:29.320
walking through a table.

57:29.320 --> 57:30.800
What?

57:30.800 --> 57:35.160
Ellie, why are you here and not like at CNN?

57:35.160 --> 57:37.960
I don't know.

57:37.960 --> 57:39.480
Is this what's happening in the world

57:39.480 --> 57:41.040
when people are like, I don't know if there are ghosts.

57:41.040 --> 57:43.560
It's because the people who have pictures are like,

57:43.560 --> 57:46.480
I'm not gonna do anything with these.

57:46.480 --> 57:48.480
What am I gonna do, show these to people?

57:49.680 --> 57:50.720
Yeah, I guess so.

57:50.720 --> 57:52.120
I don't know.

57:52.120 --> 57:54.720
We have not even glanced across the surface

57:54.720 --> 57:55.560
of your question.

57:55.560 --> 57:56.400
So you go to the caves

57:56.400 --> 57:59.480
and you loudly announce, well, I finished all my business.

57:59.480 --> 58:01.680
I wish there was more business to finish.

58:01.680 --> 58:03.000
Yeah.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.080
I wish there was somebody else with business

58:05.080 --> 58:07.760
they had not finished on this earth

58:07.760 --> 58:10.680
that I could assist with that particular issue.

58:10.680 --> 58:12.280
Cause all my business is finished.

58:12.280 --> 58:16.720
Hey, you also, you have the benefit Ellie,

58:16.720 --> 58:18.880
of apparently there is a ghost there

58:18.880 --> 58:23.880
who is well known for call and response songs.

58:24.200 --> 58:25.880
You can walk into the cave and just go,

58:25.880 --> 58:27.560
hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

58:30.320 --> 58:33.280
There's also, there could just be a echo.

58:34.920 --> 58:36.760
Dammit, you're right.

58:36.760 --> 58:38.360
Oh, I could try that I guess.

58:38.360 --> 58:39.880
Does the cave got wifi?

58:39.880 --> 58:40.720
Yes.

58:40.720 --> 58:41.560
Really?

58:43.240 --> 58:45.960
Yes, we had electricity installed into it

58:45.960 --> 58:47.600
like in the 1990s.

58:47.600 --> 58:49.480
Wow, that was your mistake.

58:49.480 --> 58:50.800
The ghosts wouldn't like that.

58:50.800 --> 58:52.640
They don't like change is what we've heard, but.

58:52.640 --> 58:54.000
Can you roll. From who?

58:54.000 --> 58:55.360
They don't know how cool it is.

58:55.360 --> 58:57.600
You got to get to this cave.

58:57.600 --> 58:59.560
If the ghosts say they don't like change

58:59.560 --> 59:02.680
is cause they don't know how cool shit is outside the cave.

59:02.680 --> 59:04.840
Like we've got a lot of stuff going on.

59:04.840 --> 59:06.600
I think you could roll up into the cave

59:06.600 --> 59:09.680
and plug into cave wifi on your computer

59:09.680 --> 59:12.320
and just turn on Netflix and just kind of wait

59:12.320 --> 59:15.720
and be like, anybody want to watch some new drama?

59:15.720 --> 59:17.280
Now, wait a minute, hold on.

59:17.280 --> 59:20.120
We don't know how wifi and ghosts interact.

59:20.120 --> 59:21.960
Maybe they're all fucking flipped out

59:21.960 --> 59:23.720
cause they're experiencing the wifi.

59:23.720 --> 59:25.440
Like when you switch it on

59:25.440 --> 59:28.480
the ghost experience all of the internet at once.

59:29.480 --> 59:30.800
A ghost in the machine if you will.

59:30.800 --> 59:32.600
A ghost in the machine if you like.

59:33.640 --> 59:36.600
You got to get the wifi out of there.

59:36.600 --> 59:38.160
Yeah. Step one, Ellie,

59:38.160 --> 59:40.560
go in there tonight under cover of darkness,

59:40.560 --> 59:43.200
remove that wifi single-handedly,

59:43.200 --> 59:46.240
get a bucket, scoop up that wifi and carry it out.

59:46.240 --> 59:48.120
I don't know how wifi works.

59:49.520 --> 59:50.720
Does that, does that help?

59:50.720 --> 59:51.560
It helps.

59:51.560 --> 59:52.400
It does, it does.

59:52.400 --> 59:53.240
Yeah, I thought it helped.

59:53.240 --> 59:54.560
Yeah, thank you so much, Ellie.

59:54.560 --> 59:55.400
Yeah.

59:55.400 --> 59:56.240
Thank you so much, Ellie.

59:56.240 --> 59:57.080
Thank you so much, Ellie.

59:57.080 --> 59:57.920
Thank you so much, Ellie.

59:57.920 --> 59:58.760
Thank you so much, Ellie.

59:58.760 --> 59:59.720
Y'all look so great.

59:59.720 --> 01:00:02.240
I have to say, I should have thought a long time ago

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:05.400
to tell people to dress nice and fun at our shows.

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.160
What were we facing?

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.440
Hey, what's up?

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:09.560
Hey, my name's Jake.

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:10.400
Hi, Jake.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:11.280
Hey, Jake.

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:12.480
Are you sure it's not Jacob?

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.720
Cause that's what you put in the email.

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:17.400
It is catfish, catfish.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.240
It is Jacob.

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.400
I was trying to be playfully short with the name.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:21.240
Okay.

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:22.080
All right.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:23.880
I think we won't tolerate here as fun.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:30.200
Jacob, you were talking about a pancake eating challenge

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.320
and I want to know all about it.

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.560
Yeah, this one, we didn't know if it was fun or not,

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:37.200
but we did need more details, so go on.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.040
All right.

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:40.320
An hour north of here is the best place on earth,

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:43.520
Merlin's Family Restaurant, Princeton, Minnesota.

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:44.360
They got a big stack.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.720
Everyone knows that, yeah.

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:46.560
Yeah.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.080
Not as hot as that cave was.

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.960
No, not.

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:52.040
Didn't you think you were going to get cave levels of

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:52.880
reactions, right?

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:53.720
I kind of did.

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:54.560
Yeah.

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.640
I got to say, if I'm going to go to one of those places,

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:59.600
I'm pretty intrigued by this big stack of pancakes.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.400
How big?

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:04.960
Approximately five inches by 18 inches across.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:05.800
Whoa.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:06.640
Holy shit.

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:07.520
Jesus Christ.

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:10.000
A real chode of pancakes.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.520
That's...

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:12.360
In order of pancakes is one pancake.

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:15.320
That's a hundred square inches of pancake.

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:16.800
If my math is correct.

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:17.640
Yes.

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.000
Well, I guess cubic.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.240
Well, I got to run the diameter.

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:22.720
Hey, somebody figure that out for me.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:23.560
How much pancake is there?

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:24.400
So what is...

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.240
Pie.

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.080
What's the pancake?

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:26.920
No, it's not pie.

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.200
It's pancakes.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.440
God almighty.

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:31.960
So the stack being five inches, but there's four.

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.720
It's comprised of four pancakes.

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:34.560
Uh-huh.

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:35.400
Wow.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:36.240
And when you eat them, when you eat them, you get...

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.080
Sure, yeah.

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:37.920
Yeah.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:41.640
That's the way I traditionally interact with pancakes.

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:43.960
When you eat them, you get a shirt and your picture

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:44.960
on the wall of fame.

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.640
If you lose, you got to take a picture.

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:48.920
I'm put on the wall of shame as well.

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:50.560
So either way you get a picture up on the wall.

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:51.680
Yeah, it's pretty sick.

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:55.000
Is it a time challenge or just like take your time

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.800
if you can eat them at all?

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:57.640
It's great.

01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:58.600
That's the trick.

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:01.240
You can stay for hours and fill yourself.

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:04.400
Oh, they don't know I know this hack.

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:05.800
Okay, go on.

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.440
Pancake restaurants hate this hack.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:08.280
Yeah.

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:12.080
And when you finish it, you still have to pay for it?

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:13.480
No, no, actually you get it for free,

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:14.800
but it's like $10 anyway.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.240
It's just pancake.

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.080
Wow.

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:17.920
Yeah, sure.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:19.360
Any dressings on them?

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:20.840
Any syrups or fruit?

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:21.680
Butters?

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:24.760
One could go nuts, but I don't like syrup or butter.

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:29.280
Anything you add to that is just more content.

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:30.760
So what's your question?

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:33.280
My question is, so every time I go there,

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:34.800
I'm gotten very good at this challenge.

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.680
I'm on the wall of fame six times.

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:37.520
Whoa.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:38.360
Fuck yeah, Jacob.

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:43.400
My brother and my brother and me, heroes only.

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:44.240
Yeah.

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:45.280
Heroes only here tonight.

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.360
And whether that be just to,

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:48.960
for the party trick of the morning

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:51.880
or to update to get more updated photo on the wall.

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:53.280
Yeah, sure.

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:54.600
So when they keep swapping out,

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.200
they don't add additional jakes?

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:57.240
No, it rotates through.

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.880
My ones from freshman year are gone.

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:02.240
Oh, you want them to stack it

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:05.160
so that you can have a flip book of you experiencing.

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.120
Exactly.

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:08.520
But in my training, I've found I can now eat.

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:10.400
Your training?

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.440
Yeah, Griffin, you don't go

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.800
and do a pancake big stack challenge cold.

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:17.040
You don't want Jacob to eat pancakes at home.

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.400
Come on.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.640
Clearly Jacob loves pancakes.

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:22.320
He does pancake challenges.

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:25.040
You would deny Jacob home game pancakes?

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:25.880
Okay, fine.

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:28.320
What if the first time you ate them was at this restaurant?

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:29.560
Like what is this?

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.400
Where can I find these in the wild?

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:32.720
Hey, what's, excuse me.

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.080
My crepes are fucking so thick.

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:36.400
Take them back.

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:39.680
These are the weirdest fucking waffles I've ever had.

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:42.360
Your toast is flying around.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:43.440
So.

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:46.760
My Doritos are stale and flavorless.

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:51.320
Sorry, Jacob, what's your question?

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:54.600
So now that I've trained to eat two big stacks,

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:56.160
this will be accomplished.

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:58.600
Am I good if I bring my own photo

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.840
to be presumably put above the wall of fame?

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.800
Fuck yes.

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.640
What?

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.960
Yes.

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:07.760
I'm glad we wasted so much time during the actual question

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.680
because the answer is yes, obviously.

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:10.760
Obviously you have to bring your own.

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:12.920
What are you thinking, boudoir?

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:13.760
I don't.

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:16.880
Champion belt, I assume.

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:21.880
I will say that if I had just finished two heapin' helpins.

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:25.520
That's 10 inches by 18 inches of pancake.

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:28.840
Then the last thing I'm going to want to do afterwards

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:31.120
is a fucking photo shoot.

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:35.240
This is tour manager Paul.

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.640
Right here, I put up a slide that said

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:40.640
this is 1,272.35 cubic inches of pancakes.

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:41.480
Can I say-

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:42.640
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:44.280
Paul, Paul, I love you.

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.200
You're a dear friend.

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.480
That can't be right.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:50.560
I will say, I will say, no timer.

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:51.840
They're not watching the bathrooms.

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:52.680
That's it.

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:53.520
Oh, what?

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:54.360
They let you poop.

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:55.200
So you can poop whenever you want.

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:56.040
Okay.

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.800
Jake, let me say, I just want to say,

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:00.320
thank you for representing what I think

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:03.320
is maybe human beings' most enduring quality,

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:05.120
which is once we've accomplished something,

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:07.000
say one big stack,

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.400
we must continue to challenge ourselves

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:10.840
even if others do not.

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:11.680
Yes.

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:15.000
You finished the big stack six times.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.160
You went on the wall six times

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:20.520
and you said there has to be more in life than this.

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.640
You're going to finish two stacks and weep

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:24.840
because there are no more stacks to conquer.

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:26.160
But good news, Jake.

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:28.840
I'm here to tell you three stacks.

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:32.240
No, do two stacks and do send us a picture of that, Jake.

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.080
I got to see it.

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:34.760
Does that help?

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:35.600
Yes, it does.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.760
The encouragement will help me join my brothers in syrup.

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:38.600
Thank you.

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:39.440
Yes.

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:44.440
Give me five.

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:48.600
Hello.

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:49.440
Hello.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.360
Hi, brothers.

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:53.200
Hi. Hi.

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:55.400
For a second there, I thought the mic wasn't working.

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:56.240
You got this.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.080
You got this.

01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:58.360
No, I was just scared.

01:05:58.360 --> 01:05:59.200
I'm Andy.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.040
Say them.

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:00.880
Hi, Andy.

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:01.720
Andy, you're great.

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:02.560
I'm glad you're here.

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:03.400
Yeah, we got this.

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:04.240
Relax.

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:05.080
You asked-

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:05.920
Breathe through it.

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:10.920
You're as powerful as someone who just finished two big stacks.

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:15.520
I don't know that powerful is the adjective

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:16.360
I would use to describe you.

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:18.760
You're as sleepy as someone who just finished two big stacks.

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:20.400
You're ready to hibernate through the winter.

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:23.760
Andy asked, how do I enforce my workplace's

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:25.760
no touching the dinosaurs rule

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:27.880
while still letting people know that I'm cool

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:30.200
and I would also like to touch the dinosaur.

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:36.360
So give me a little context here, Andy.

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:38.240
I work at a dentist's office.

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.960
Yeah.

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:41.560
Yeah, just a really cool shoe store, actually.

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:42.400
Yeah.

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:43.240
No.

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:45.240
No, I work at a science attraction

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:49.360
where we do have real original fossil dinosaurs displayed.

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:50.200
Wow.

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.040
And it's very cool.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:51.960
You get to be very close.

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:55.080
It feels you're immersed in the science.

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:58.360
And also the barriers are like exactly

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:00.000
sort of at toddler forehead height.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.760
And that's kind of it.

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:04.000
And there are a lot of children and adults

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.080
who really, really want to touch the dinosaurs.

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:07.880
Sure.

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:08.680
Yeah.

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:10.160
I would like to touch the dinosaurs.

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:11.560
I would like to touch the dinosaurs.

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.200
I would like my finger grease to destroy

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.840
a dinosaur bone over time.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:15.960
Yeah.

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:17.000
I mean, listen.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.120
If time and Earth couldn't do it,

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:22.280
what are my Dorito fingers going to do that's so bad?

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:23.400
Yeah.

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:26.000
If they can't hang, don't pull them out

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.320
if you don't want me to touch them.

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:29.560
So Andy, what's the problem?

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:32.640
Well, the problem is that I really, really

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:33.800
want to touch the dinosaur.

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:34.600
All the time.

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:37.760
Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy,

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:41.600
have you touched the dinosaurs?

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:44.840
Because I noticed earlier you said a science attraction

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:47.280
and not the name of the business because there

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:49.520
would be a revelation you've touched the dinosaurs.

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:51.000
Yeah.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:51.840
Yeah.

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:53.160
No, Andy.

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:54.880
Andy, have you touched the dinosaurs?

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:57.640
Not even an accidental like, whoa.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:00.120
The more we talk, the less Andy has to admit their crime.

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.200
OK, moving on.

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:11.200
Andy refuses to incriminate themselves.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.480
Andy takes the fifth.

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:14.160
But how do you let them know it's

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:17.120
a normal and natural impulse in life

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:18.440
to want to touch the dinosaurs?

01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:21.280
They're not perverted in any way.

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:24.600
I really want to be like supportive but firm, you know?

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.080
Yeah.

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:26.840
And as dads, I would hope he would like help.

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:30.800
OK, you're going to want to do a heavy sigh and then I get it.

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:32.600
I get it.

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.720
That is the number of times I've said

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:37.640
to my five-year-old who is a carbon copy of myself

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:40.680
when it comes to impulse control, I get it.

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:42.160
Hey, buddy, I get it.

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:42.720
I get it.

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:45.160
I also sometimes want to see what sound a thing makes

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:46.520
when I throw it at the wall.

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:47.320
I get it.

01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:52.440
So on brand.

01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:56.040
Can you, Andy, can I suggest this?

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:59.920
Could you have one dinosaur bone that's kind of bad?

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:00.440
Yeah.

01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:02.080
And it's like a burner.

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:03.360
Yeah, an extra one.

01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:04.640
We got three legs.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.360
And listen, you want to touch the dinosaur, I get it.

01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:07.600
Hold on, let me open my locker.

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.840
I got one back there for you that you

01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:11.680
can touch all you want, no big deal.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.720
Can you memorize the speech that Sam Neill gives

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:16.120
at the beginning of Jurassic Park

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:18.880
where he scares the boy very badly with a velociraptor claw

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:22.320
and just deliver that whenever a child wants to touch the bone?

01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:26.600
Or really runs afoul of any kind of rule?

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:30.440
Excuse me, did you just drop that litter on the ground?

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:31.800
Let me tell you a little bit about velociraptor.

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.440
Well, that's not how the velociraptor gets you.

01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:34.040
Here, come here.

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:36.560
I'm going to scratch your tummy with this.

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:38.960
Andy, could you sell dinosaur bone touching gloves

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:40.080
for $5 a pop?

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.120
Ooh.

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.560
On the side.

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:43.080
How?

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:43.960
That little private.

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:46.360
This would not be an official piece of merchandise.

01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:49.120
This would be, yes, you would produce them from your jacket.

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:51.880
How straight is the security here?

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:55.320
Could you charge people to touch the bones

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:58.080
when no one's looking?

01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:59.400
Probably for a little bit.

01:09:59.400 --> 01:09:59.900
Yeah.

01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:00.400
OK.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.960
Maybe not all the time.

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:04.600
Does that help, Andy?

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:05.240
It does help.

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:05.720
Thank you.

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:06.200
Thank you.

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:06.680
Thank you.

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:07.160
Thank you.

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:08.920
Thank you.

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:09.440
OK.

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:10.560
And thank you.

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:11.160
And thank you.

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.680
Make them go away, please.

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:14.040
I'm so intimidated.

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:14.560
Thank you.

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:15.120
Goodbye.

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:15.600
Yes.

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:16.880
Make us more.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:17.920
Make them less.

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:19.240
Yes.

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:22.840
Hey, you all have been outrageously fun.

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:23.640
Thank you so much.

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.440
Yes, thank you all.

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:29.160
We have done so much stupid bullshit tonight.

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:31.000
And you all have been there for all of it.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.040
And I really, really appreciate it.

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:32.680
Even Taylor.

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:34.520
And Taylor didn't know what was happening.

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:36.760
Yeah, even Taylor was into it.

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:37.920
But you all have buoyed us.

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:41.560
You lift me up so I can climb on mountains.

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:43.640
Thank you.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.360
We want to say thank you to you.

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:48.600
Thank you to the beautiful Orpheum Theater.

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:50.560
It feels like we tricked our way into here,

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:51.880
which we kind of did.

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:54.360
Sorry you guys didn't get to see Jim Gaffigan tonight.

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:55.880
I know you were expecting it.

01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:56.800
So sorry.

01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:01.160
We want to say thank you to Paul for helping us run the show.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.200
Thank you to Amanda.

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:05.880
And thank you to Rachel for helping to run the show

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:07.880
and doing the recordings and all of that stuff.

01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:09.480
Thank you to our dad, Clint.

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:12.000
Thank you, Clint.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.280
Buy his book.

01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:17.680
Thank you to our families for supporting us here.

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:20.240
And let me see, anything else?

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:22.320
Thanks to Montaigne for these four theme songs.

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:25.360
My life is better with you.

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:27.040
Sidney McElroy is not with us.

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:28.480
Dr. Sidney McElroy is not with us.

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:34.120
But I really appreciate her just being her, I guess.

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:38.200
Now, we don't do a final Yahoo anymore, as you know.

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:40.580
And it's brought a really fun energy

01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:43.560
because we get to ask you, our beloved listeners,

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:45.680
what celebrity impression you'd love to hear

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:47.720
a Griffin McElroy attempt.

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:50.600
OK, so on upcoming episodes, you can look forward

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:54.520
to Nicolas Cage and Gilbert Godfrey.

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:57.840
So what celebrity impression would you like to hear?

01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:58.720
First five rows.

01:11:58.720 --> 01:11:59.520
Oh, wait, hold on.

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:03.800
First five rows, so it doesn't just become.

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:05.300
Oh, do you have a walk-in, Griff?

01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:06.040
A walk-in?

01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:06.600
Yeah.

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:07.520
Yeah, I guess.

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:17.120
Uh, uh, what kind of shit?

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:23.880
I like, I like to eat the, I like to eat the spaghetti.

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:25.240
That sucks shit.

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:26.400
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.880
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.640
I don't deserve to say my name.

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:32.080
It's remember, remember, remember me.

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.720
Gives your dad's square on the lips.

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:40.200
I'm just bringing it in, everyone.

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:43.680
It's better with you.

01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:49.160
My life, ah, it's better, it's better with you.

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:50.160
It's better with you.

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:55.640
My life, ah, it's better, it's better with you.

01:12:55.640 --> 01:13:01.620
Because it's true, ah, it's better, it's better with you.

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:10.600
