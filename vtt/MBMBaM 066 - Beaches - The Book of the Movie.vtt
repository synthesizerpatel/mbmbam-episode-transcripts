00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:16.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:16.000 --> 00:30.880
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.880 --> 00:51.760
Times are tough. I mean, you take a look at the stock ticker on the wall and you'll see

00:51.760 --> 00:57.520
times are tough economically. We're going into a national economic disaster, but here,

00:57.520 --> 01:03.600
like a beam of light, is your Shirley Temple of the modern economic depression. My brother,

01:03.600 --> 01:10.160
my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era. I am your co-brother and sunshine on a

01:10.160 --> 01:17.200
cloudy day, Justin McElroy. I am Travis McElroy and your animal crackers in your soup. I'm the

01:17.200 --> 01:22.800
Skittles in your pocket, Griffin McElroy. Guys, my blue chip stocks done turned red.

01:22.800 --> 01:28.880
Yep. I don't, I am insolvent over here. A lot of red ink. Don't know what to do. I've been attacked

01:28.880 --> 01:36.640
by the bulls and the bears. Yeah. And the, and the pistons and the oilers. Are they still around?

01:37.200 --> 01:44.320
Oilers? Yeah, sure. Okay, cool. Texans now, right? I just don't, I just, I made a lot of bad

01:44.320 --> 01:50.080
investments and I don't. Tell me, give me, give me the number one investment that you regret above

01:50.080 --> 01:55.520
all the others. I mean, a lot of bad investments litter that path to financial ruin. But what would

01:55.520 --> 02:03.680
you say your number one worst investment was? Books. Why did you think like books? Like what,

02:04.320 --> 02:12.400
what do you mean? I thought. Put it all on borders. I, I put a lot on borders, but mostly just the

02:12.400 --> 02:20.000
medium of books is what I invested it in. So like the idea of books. Stock symbol B O K S, which

02:20.000 --> 02:25.520
looks like box, but you, you know what it means. I, I thought, you know, I thought TV and movies,

02:25.520 --> 02:33.760
I thought this was just a passing fad. It was, it was a poor choice and I wasn't counting on the

02:33.760 --> 02:39.760
illiteracy epidemic that's ravaging our world. You couldn't have known. How could I have known?

02:39.760 --> 02:46.000
How could you have known? Let's, uh, what I think we should do is to sort of make sure that nothing

02:46.000 --> 02:52.800
that bad ever happens to anyone again. We should answer questions on our advice show and in doing

02:52.800 --> 02:59.120
so help them to avoid calamity. What do you think? And maybe convince them to, you know,

02:59.120 --> 03:04.560
buy a book or two. Hey, maybe pick up a book while you're out today. Maybe buy a bookstore. I don't

03:04.560 --> 03:12.400
know a lot of money into it. I don't know where you would do that since there aren't any bookstores

03:12.400 --> 03:22.320
left and most libraries are pretty shitty. Um, but, but maybe a yard sale. Most libraries today

03:22.320 --> 03:28.480
are basically just a bunch of DVDs, like a bunch of bad DVDs that they bought from blockbusters that

03:28.480 --> 03:35.440
were closing. It's like just a bunch of copies of like Canadian bacon and UHF on VHS. I'm sorry,

03:35.440 --> 03:43.360
did you say bad movies? No, I mean like easy to obtain movies from Amazon, way cheap to get UHF.

03:43.360 --> 03:49.200
Like way cheap. Yeah. And your library, that's all your library has anymore. Is UHF and Canadian

03:49.200 --> 03:55.600
bacon and strange. She's out, she's out of control. Love potion number nine. Yeah, exactly. Is UHF in

03:55.600 --> 04:00.880
the biography section? Cause that is basically the story of weird Al. It's a true life story.

04:01.680 --> 04:09.200
Um, Hey, my software year, I asked out a girl as you can guess, she said no. Okay. What? Why would

04:09.200 --> 04:16.400
I guess that? I know nothing about you. She, I guess like is the, is the assumption that I,

04:16.400 --> 04:21.360
since I'm writing to you and I listened to your show, she said no. She said, yes, things are great.

04:21.360 --> 04:27.200
Don't know why I wrote you. How can I stop being so happy all the time and in love? She also said,

04:27.200 --> 04:31.440
I really like you, but I'm not looking for a boyfriend right now, but we are going into our

04:31.440 --> 04:38.000
senior year and she's still the only girl I really like. So my questions are these when she said that

04:38.000 --> 04:42.800
she really likes me, but doesn't want a boyfriend. Was that just her telling me that she doesn't like

04:42.800 --> 04:50.800
me at all? Let's start here. Yes. Yes. And do you have any advice on how to get over a girl?

04:50.800 --> 04:54.720
Because this is just starting to get sad on my part. Any help is appreciated brothers. That's

04:54.720 --> 05:00.800
from infatuated in Florida. The line I, I really like you, but I'm not looking for a boyfriend

05:00.800 --> 05:06.720
slash girlfriend right now is like textbook high school, letting them down easy. Everybody is

05:06.720 --> 05:11.600
always looking for a boyfriend and girlfriend. Just wait till you get in college and you get

05:11.600 --> 05:15.760
that line. And then like a week later, that person is dating someone like that'll happen

05:15.760 --> 05:20.800
three or four times. And eventually you get the message. I'm cool. I'm cool being lonely. Um,

05:21.440 --> 05:26.720
I don't actually want my counterpart on this earth. I don't want my soul to join with another's.

05:26.720 --> 05:30.240
I'm looking to wander like that dude on Kung Fu, just kind of going,

05:30.240 --> 05:36.400
going around doing stuff by myself, mostly by myself. Yeah. Uh, yeah. I mean,

05:37.680 --> 05:44.320
yes, she's not, she's just not that into you. Now, how do you get over her? That's the question.

05:44.320 --> 05:50.320
My, my recipe, my, my tincture, my, my pulses for this sort of thing is time.

05:51.920 --> 06:01.920
And imagine her, um, on the bathroom, making a bathroom. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Why?

06:01.920 --> 06:09.200
Why would you do that? Well, if he imagines her making bathroom, then it will ruin the, uh,

06:09.200 --> 06:14.960
construct of fantasy that he has built for her. It'll tear down the statue of sexiness. Right now

06:14.960 --> 06:20.320
he's put it up on a sexy pedestal and he needs to put her on a porcelain pedestal. Exactly. He needs

06:20.320 --> 06:27.200
to put her on a porta potty. Literally set her on top of a porta potty. Right. Um, if you imagine

06:27.200 --> 06:35.200
her in the bathroom, that helps unless you're dirty. If you start to feel an inkling and inkling

06:35.200 --> 06:40.640
you back out of that fantasy as fast as you can. An inkle of it, of a tingle. You bounce from that

06:40.640 --> 06:44.800
thought. Bounce from it. Slam it in reverse and you run back out of there. I need you to tie a

06:44.800 --> 06:52.800
rope around your waist and leave, leave the slack with a trusted friend as you dip in. If I pull

06:52.800 --> 07:01.360
twice, you get me out of that shit. This is Inception 2. This is Inception 2 poopy spelunking

07:01.360 --> 07:07.040
and I'm going down in this incepted fantasy. And listen, if I yank on this, you pull back.

07:07.040 --> 07:13.600
I don't care how much I protest. And if I yank on this, you kill me. You kill me. Um, here's the

07:13.600 --> 07:18.080
thing though, cause you said time and I think that's absolutely true, but here's what most

07:18.080 --> 07:23.200
people fail to take into consideration with time. So this was his sophomore year. This is his senior

07:23.200 --> 07:28.880
year. So let's say a year, year and a half since then, uh, going on two years. Time doesn't work if

07:28.880 --> 07:34.160
you're still thinking about it two years later. It has to be, I've made the decision to let this go.

07:34.720 --> 07:40.320
Now time will help. Not, it's been two years. Why can't I let this go? You need a catalyst

07:40.320 --> 07:45.360
to kick that kind of thing off, right? You can't just like, so you need, you need, you need an

07:45.360 --> 07:53.120
event to kick off that decision. And I think that because you live in Florida, that there's a lot of

07:53.120 --> 08:01.200
options open to you, like a, like a weekend trip to Miami, you want me to drown yourself and fly

08:01.200 --> 08:06.640
honeys because that's all, pretty much all they have. If Will Smith is to be believed and his,

08:06.640 --> 08:12.160
his word is, has always been unimpeachable and serial killers. Yeah. Serial killers.

08:12.880 --> 08:17.200
Is there a serial killer down there? Dexter's there, but he kills serial killers, so you're

08:17.200 --> 08:22.080
probably fine. So it's probably per capita better for serial killers because he's really cleaning

08:22.080 --> 08:29.040
it, cleaning up the streets down there. We've got to get down to me and me. I know it's popping off

08:29.600 --> 08:34.240
and, uh, every day, I think as long as you're not serial killing, it's dope. I think serial

08:34.240 --> 08:36.800
killers are probably starting spreading the word now that you shouldn't go down there.

08:37.680 --> 08:42.400
There's a dark passenger, a vigilante, if you will. Hey, my brother, my brother and me in a few weeks,

08:42.400 --> 08:46.480
I'll be returning to school and I'm going to start training as a resident assistant.

08:46.480 --> 08:54.560
Do you have any advice for me? Important in Ithaca. Did any of us live in on campus housing?

08:54.560 --> 09:00.320
I did. You lived in a dorm? Yes, I did for two years. So you're the only one I think who got

09:00.320 --> 09:08.320
into shenanigans, uh, on a, on a school. So what, what bad, what, what bad things did you do that

09:08.320 --> 09:13.920
they can stop other people from doing? Oh God, really? Um, well, I don't know if it's bad,

09:13.920 --> 09:18.560
but my favorite thing we did is we had this one kid, um, that we just terrorized and,

09:18.560 --> 09:23.040
but in a friendly way. Well, so like he would, well, he would leave town and we would convert

09:23.040 --> 09:29.360
his bed into a castle or, uh, he left town and we converted his bed into a time machine.

09:30.400 --> 09:34.320
These pranks actually sound like awesome things that you're doing for him. Yeah. Well, but yes,

09:34.320 --> 09:41.120
it basically consisted of taking his room apart with a drill and rebuilding it in, in our chosen

09:41.120 --> 09:48.800
image. Um, and so basically like, what is your tip here? If you hear people using drills. If you

09:48.800 --> 09:54.320
see them making a time machine, then cut, cut that out. Yeah. Well, I guess it's the question

09:54.320 --> 10:01.120
how to be a better RA or how to be a better light RA. What's the, yeah. I mean, do you want to be

10:01.120 --> 10:08.400
cool? Are you cool, man? Are you cool with drugs? Are you cool with partying and, and like,

10:08.400 --> 10:13.280
kiss like kissing after hours? You need to make some decisions about what kind of parent you're

10:13.280 --> 10:18.640
going to be. Do you want to be firm? Do you want to be nice daddy that they come to when they need

10:18.640 --> 10:25.280
something? Do you want to run the place, um, with a totalitarian fist? Like that's what I,

10:25.280 --> 10:29.680
that's what I'm feeling. That's what I'd be. I think the best RA is the one where like,

10:29.680 --> 10:34.480
you can't see their subtle influence. Like if they know that you're controlling them,

10:34.480 --> 10:39.360
then you've gone too far. I think you need to be there, but pretty much fade in the background.

10:39.360 --> 10:44.400
You're not going to be friends with these people. I'm talking about, I would be like a Stalin-esque

10:44.400 --> 10:52.640
figure. Like no, no pasta, no pasta in the dorms. You lock the doors at 11. If they show up at 1101,

10:52.640 --> 10:59.920
they're sleeping in the elevator lobby. Yeah. I love that. Like psychological sort of aggressive,

10:59.920 --> 11:04.880
psychological. Oh, there you go. Assign half of your dorm to be guards and have to be prisoners

11:05.440 --> 11:14.080
and then just see how that goes. I'm not sure that the faculty of this institution would smile on

11:14.080 --> 11:20.400
that. Basically become a warden of the floor. You're talking about, you're talking about mind

11:20.400 --> 11:26.240
freaking an entire floor of students. Yes. I'm not sure that's legal. That's not a legal thing to do.

11:26.240 --> 11:32.160
Yeah. The number one thing that you have to do to sort of keep,

11:34.880 --> 11:42.560
let's call it stability or just maybe just sort of control is you've got to pick out the cool hand

11:42.560 --> 11:50.880
Luke on the floor day one. Who is going to be the one? The Andy Dufresne. Who is your Andy Dufresne

11:50.880 --> 12:01.920
that's going to try to rally the other prisoners? You have to be the Strother Martin for this floor,

12:02.880 --> 12:07.360
the captain for this floor. And then beat him in a golden eye tournament. And then beat him in a

12:07.360 --> 12:11.760
golden eye tournament so they know, it's like shooting a guy in the dorms. You got to out

12:11.760 --> 12:20.720
sack him on the quad. Is that a competitive? Can you win at sack? I mean, if other people

12:20.720 --> 12:27.520
are watching and you can, you can because if they see you, you lose. But if you could secretly hack

12:27.520 --> 12:34.160
well for long enough, then, uh, that's the only way to win. And even that is, you can see your,

12:34.160 --> 12:39.440
Jesus can see you. Jesus. Jesus always knows when you're playing hacky sack. And he's always,

12:40.720 --> 12:46.000
I want to hit you with this idea. I bet if they had been around and they may very well have been,

12:46.000 --> 12:50.080
if they had been around in biblical times, Jesus and the disciples would have had,

12:50.080 --> 12:53.680
Oh my God. Are you kidding? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Fully right sandals.

12:54.960 --> 13:00.080
Like drink this wine. It is my bud. Play with this hacky sack. It is awesome.

13:03.600 --> 13:08.400
That's in the Gnostic gospels. Judas dropped the sack. Get out of here. Judas.

13:08.400 --> 13:12.320
Get out of here. Judas. I'll teach you. Will you? Do you still have my rusted root CDs?

13:12.320 --> 13:19.360
We're trying to, we're trying to feel something over here. See, I would submit that like,

13:19.360 --> 13:26.240
I think hack technology could have existed. It's a fucking bag filled with beans. Exactly.

13:26.240 --> 13:32.640
Space age. Like they could put like bag of sand, a sandbag basically, right? Like just, just

13:32.640 --> 13:37.600
problem with sand is that it's going to dampen the kinetic output of your limbs. You really,

13:37.600 --> 13:42.400
you really got to get beans in there cause beans, uh, they give, they give you. For all we know, Jesus

13:42.400 --> 13:48.160
was hanging out playing cornhole. Now I, okay. That's possible. I guess like that. I mean, again,

13:48.160 --> 13:55.200
that technology, he was a carpenter. Yeah. Today. So Jesus invented cornhole. Today, Joshua, I will

13:55.200 --> 14:02.160
take you out back and teach you how to make a sweet cornhole bowl. You have to paint it with

14:02.160 --> 14:10.560
your favorite NFL team logo. My name is Jesus and I talk like my favorite team is the saints.

14:12.080 --> 14:16.320
Bask in it. My name is Jesus and I talk like a text to speech converter.

14:20.640 --> 14:26.880
I have a Yahoo that I think we should explore. Hit me. This one was sent in by Adam Jorgensen

14:26.880 --> 14:32.720
or perhaps Jorgensen. Thank you, Adam. That last name. Uh, it's by Yahoo answers user,

14:32.720 --> 14:40.400
big heart who asks how many different types of sex is there? These are about to get real blue

14:40.400 --> 14:48.400
on this show. So this is a dad alert. Dad's click it off moms. You can stay. Um, I mean,

14:48.400 --> 14:52.880
like breakup sex, makeup, sex, angry sex. I need a roof over my head sex or my personal favorite.

14:52.880 --> 14:57.440
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We just watched. I need to try that sex. I need a roof over my

14:57.440 --> 15:02.800
head. Like homeless person sex. I just wonder how many you can think of. I think it means like,

15:02.800 --> 15:10.000
I need a place to stay tonight. I'll fuck you. I'll give you this. I'll give you this. I have

15:10.000 --> 15:15.440
this for you. I need a ride to the airport sex. I need a ride to the airport. Sex is good sex.

15:15.440 --> 15:24.320
That's a good one. Um, I ran out of toothpaste sex, a cup of sugar sex, surf and turf sex,

15:25.920 --> 15:33.680
time travel sex, the technology for that. Well, of course it wouldn't exist in the modern day,

15:33.680 --> 15:37.760
but like that time travel sex is when you go back in time and tell someone like,

15:38.400 --> 15:42.560
if we don't do this, if we don't do this scientists of my day, et cetera, et cetera.

15:42.560 --> 15:48.160
Yeah. Fill in the blank. Yeah. Right. Hurry down doomsday. That's that sort of thing.

15:48.720 --> 15:52.880
That's a fine type of sex. That's how you, that's and then you birth yourself. You give birth to

15:52.880 --> 15:59.040
yourself. You're your own dad. That's that paradox sex. There's, um, pretending to be someone's

15:59.040 --> 16:06.000
guardian angel sex. That's a great one. Can you, can you expound? Can we explore that? Yeah. What's

16:06.000 --> 16:11.920
the line there you give them? Um, I'm doing this for your own good. Yeah. I gotta save you. There's

16:11.920 --> 16:17.440
an earthquake that's about to happen. I gotta, I gotta nail you down. There's a lot of manipulation

16:17.440 --> 16:22.160
in your guy's sex. I wish it would be more consensual because a lot of this is like putting

16:22.160 --> 16:27.280
pressure on someone of a sort of universal scale and I'm not sure that's even romantically. I mean,

16:27.280 --> 16:33.200
there's all kinds of like there's forthright sex. There's, there's straightforward, no fool in sex.

16:33.840 --> 16:40.240
There's thank you so much for the lasagna sex, which is different than all the other,

16:40.240 --> 16:47.520
um, positive gratitude, sexual encounters. Um, lasagna, you really give it that special

16:47.520 --> 16:51.840
something because it's multi-layered. It takes so long to make. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's commitment.

16:53.920 --> 17:02.560
Uh-oh sex. Birthday sex. R. Kelly knows all about that. R. Kelly knows about birthday sex. He has a

17:02.560 --> 17:06.880
song called birthday sex. Oh, does he? We could have a segment on the show where I just talked

17:06.880 --> 17:10.560
about R. Kelly song titles and how great they are. Like, like pussy cry.

17:14.080 --> 17:20.400
There's, um, I think my house is haunted sex. Okay. Spectral sex. I don't feel safe. I don't

17:20.400 --> 17:26.640
feel safe in my own home. So you want to bone down? Uh-huh. To scare the ghosts away. Oh,

17:26.640 --> 17:32.960
that's right because they can't look at this, at the sex happening. Uh-huh. Right. Um, I think

17:32.960 --> 17:38.400
my bread is broken, but I'm not sure. Sex. Yeah. Let's find out. Let's find out. Let's find out sex.

17:39.280 --> 17:46.160
Hey. The acoustic sex. Text the acoustic. Test my new soundproofing sex. Sex unplugged.

17:48.880 --> 17:55.440
Did you guys hear Tracy chat last night? She was amazing. She did a fast car and I was like,

17:55.440 --> 18:03.680
slow down. Um, I want to lose it. There's a, there's a, I'm pretending you're Tracy Chapman.

18:06.320 --> 18:10.800
Is it all sex pretending on your Tracy Chapman sex? Yeah. Technically all sex is pretending

18:10.800 --> 18:17.760
you're Tracy Chapman sex, but other persons, Tracy Chapman or pretending yourself are Tracy Chapman.

18:17.760 --> 18:27.600
Yeah. Exactly. Or pretending that you are Tracy Chapman making love with Tracy Chapman. That is a

18:27.600 --> 18:33.600
crazy, crazy afternoon. I'm going to look up a really quick, a JPEG of Tracy Chapman. Okay.

18:34.240 --> 18:39.680
Just not weird or anything, but let's just like. Do you, do you need to be able to like focus on

18:39.680 --> 18:42.960
her face when you're saying these things about her? Yeah, I can't make these goofs unless. Yeah,

18:42.960 --> 18:48.800
that's a good looking lady. She kind of looks like, um, kind of looks like, uh, I'm not actually

18:48.800 --> 18:55.120
looking at a picture right now. Let's, let's all take a break and look at a picture. Everybody,

18:55.120 --> 19:00.640
let's take a second to contemplate Tracy Chapman. This is our, um, this is our new segment called

19:00.640 --> 19:07.600
look at a picture of Tracy Chapman. Guys, this is great, but I need to go have looking at pictures

19:07.600 --> 19:13.040
of Tracy Chapman sex. Okay. Now how is that different from pretending your partner is Tracy

19:13.040 --> 19:19.920
Chapman sex? Well, it's more active. It's more of a, it's more of a, this is, this is the gun,

19:19.920 --> 19:27.200
the starting gun that kickstarted my heart. Uh, and now I got, I just have to go high sex.

19:28.320 --> 19:33.040
Got to, and of course I'm going to think about Tracy Chapman during the act because I'm. You're

19:33.040 --> 19:37.840
saying it normally converts from one to the other. I'm saying there's a smooth transition.

19:39.200 --> 19:42.480
Not all Tracy Chapman sex is let's all look at a picture of Tracy Chapman sex,

19:42.480 --> 19:49.360
but all the other one other way around. So not all squares or rectangles that guy. Oh yeah.

19:49.360 --> 19:53.120
Right. But all rectangles do want to make you have sex while thinking about Tracy Chapman.

19:53.120 --> 19:58.960
Okay. Great. If you were to make a Venn diagram where Tracy Chapman was on one side of it and

19:58.960 --> 20:04.400
sex is on the other, it would be very close together. It would look like a match.

20:04.400 --> 20:09.120
Almost overlapping except for Tracy Chapman herself. She would be on the outside.

20:09.120 --> 20:16.400
She is, she is of course asexual. She's in charge. She is in charge. She runs this show.

20:17.520 --> 20:24.640
Hey Phillip, uh, why is there not Evian in my, my trailer specifically says that, uh, that I,

20:24.640 --> 20:30.480
that I need that need that thing. One of these days we're going to do a bit where we make references

20:30.480 --> 20:37.440
to, um, a relevant figure in the media. And I think that'll probably be when the show ends.

20:37.440 --> 20:42.160
Well, you know why? Do you know why? At least for myself, I don't first, I don't know that many new

20:42.160 --> 20:49.760
people that are around too. I'm not sure that I know enough about the new people to say things.

20:49.760 --> 20:54.480
If I say things about Tracy Chapman, you, no one knows enough about Tracy Chapman to call me on

20:54.480 --> 21:02.080
it. Yeah. Hey, I feel like people who know me see me as a character rather than a real person.

21:02.960 --> 21:08.480
It might be due to the fact that I'm very outspoken wear big hipster glasses or the

21:08.480 --> 21:13.520
fact that I'm a funny girl. I feel like when I talk to many of my acquaintances,

21:13.520 --> 21:18.800
they want me to perform for them or something. Anyway, how can I get people to see me as a normal

21:18.800 --> 21:24.480
person and not just a character? Should I just become more of an asshole and be less outgoing?

21:25.040 --> 21:29.280
Should I dress differently? Help me brothers. That's from normal and NYC.

21:29.920 --> 21:36.480
I think people treat you the way you allow them to treat you. Does that make any sense?

21:36.480 --> 21:42.800
Yeah. So like if, if you've spent all of your time playing into the perception that you are

21:42.800 --> 21:49.600
or this funny performer for them, like if that's the niche that you like worked into the group,

21:49.600 --> 21:54.240
if you're like, Hey, I'm the funny one. And you embrace that and wanted to be, you know,

21:54.240 --> 22:00.000
welcomed into the group as that person. It's your job now to change that perception. If you want to,

22:01.360 --> 22:04.560
the only thing you can do really is be yourself. And if they like that person,

22:05.280 --> 22:09.200
then you're, you're going to keep hanging out. If they don't, you're going to be,

22:09.200 --> 22:12.640
you're going to be emailing us again in three months saying, how do I meet people? No one likes

22:12.640 --> 22:17.680
me. I used to be funny and outgoing and now I'm quiet. Yeah. I don't, I don't think the answer is

22:17.680 --> 22:22.640
like radically changing to the opposite end of the spectrum. Cause now go, why are you being an

22:22.640 --> 22:27.280
asshole? And then you'd still be a character. You'd just be, you'd just be sad girl with glasses.

22:27.280 --> 22:33.440
Right. The sad one. And I'd be willing to bet that without any background or further details. So this

22:33.440 --> 22:40.080
is a young person question. This is like either in college or fresh out of college, still figuring

22:40.080 --> 22:46.000
out who you are and like a solidifying personality. Yeah. Because so much, as you get older, so much

22:46.000 --> 22:51.280
of your, so much of this question is answered by your actions. I mean, it has less to do with

22:51.280 --> 22:58.640
the sort of personality box that you've built for yourself and more about the actual things that you

22:58.640 --> 23:05.520
do in your day to day life as things get, you know, as these relationships progress.

23:07.680 --> 23:10.480
Is there anything really wrong with being a character though?

23:14.000 --> 23:19.440
There are so many good characters out there. It depends on if it's sustainable. Like if you're

23:19.440 --> 23:23.760
the guy that drinks till five o'clock in the morning, every morning, and then goes to work

23:23.760 --> 23:29.600
at seven and you're this wild, crazy partier guy, that's not sustainable forever. That's

23:29.600 --> 23:35.760
you. You miss, you misunderstand. I mean, an actual literal character from a literary work

23:35.760 --> 23:43.760
or movie or a book. You mean, you mean today I'm holding Caulfield. I, that is precisely what I

23:43.760 --> 23:49.280
mean. Like what kind of literary character do you, I mean, like, like a Dorian Gray, like a Dorian

23:49.280 --> 23:53.840
Gray. That's a little, I'm not sure that her friends would get that ref though. Um, also

23:53.840 --> 24:00.400
shooting that painting. I got that literary reference. It was the one with the painting in it.

24:00.400 --> 24:06.320
Um, I mean like, uh, um, a character from third rock from the sun.

24:09.680 --> 24:12.240
So you're saying she should embody

24:12.240 --> 24:20.320
a character played by say John Lithgow. I'm the matrix. I'm the, I'm, I'm the matrix guy.

24:21.040 --> 24:25.600
Now the matrix guy was not, the matrix is not a character. You do realize that of course.

24:25.600 --> 24:27.920
Right. Right. You mean that you mean, um,

24:29.360 --> 24:34.800
I'm Harry Potter and the goblet of fire. I'm the goblet of fire. It is a pleasure to meet you.

24:34.800 --> 24:43.120
Hippogriff. I'm casting a spell now. Hippogriff. Um, I mean, it could be a lady character. It could

24:43.120 --> 24:51.680
be, uh, could be, uh, eat, pray, love. Who eat, pray, love. It could be eat, pray, love. Hi,

24:51.680 --> 24:59.120
I'm eat, pray, love. Do you want to go to India with me? This spaghetti is delicious. How I can

24:59.120 --> 25:06.320
do any, if you name any literary character such as anything from eat, pray, love to the goblet of

25:06.320 --> 25:13.920
fire. Okay. I will, I will impersonate. Mystic pizza. Mystic pizza. Oh, there's some spooky

25:13.920 --> 25:20.640
pepperoni. Pass the insight. Okay. Okay. Um, the sisterhood of the traveling pants. Hey,

25:20.640 --> 25:28.160
come back here. Hey, hey, hey, I'm all skin and undies down there. Come on back. I don't know how

25:28.160 --> 25:33.680
we can, how she can use this. She can't just walk around without pants and say, hi, I'm sisterhood

25:33.680 --> 25:39.040
of the traveling pants because then I got any other, you got any other characters for me or

25:39.040 --> 25:44.960
I'm all mine are empowered female groups. Divine secrets of the sisterhood, fried green tomatoes.

25:44.960 --> 25:49.840
This is all I got. These are crunchy yet sour. I just learned about growing up.

25:49.840 --> 26:02.880
Um, beaches, what beaches and or moon struck, uh, beaches, uh, moon struck. I have not seen,

26:04.000 --> 26:13.600
uh, beaches, uh, uh, women, you throw wings. That's all I know. That was not good. I'm not sure.

26:13.600 --> 26:19.920
Beaches trivia. Okay. Was beaches a book though? I have a literary mind. I thought you were all

26:19.920 --> 26:25.760
into books. Now you have a stake in them. Um, it proves me beaches was a book. I have to believe

26:25.760 --> 26:31.600
that there is a book adaptation of the film beaches and I have to believe that I have won

26:31.600 --> 26:37.520
all the book prices that books can win best book based on beaches.

26:37.520 --> 26:47.520
And now the 1997 best book award goes to beaches. The book of the movie with Bette Midler.

26:49.520 --> 26:54.320
You can only read it once because once you get to the end, your tears have soaked the book through

26:54.320 --> 26:59.120
just throw it away. Buy a new beaches book, buy two beaches book. I need your money.

26:59.920 --> 27:02.320
Mark Twain. Come on up here and accept this award.

27:02.320 --> 27:06.000
I'm glad he came out of retirement to write a beach is the book of the movie with Bette Midler.

27:06.880 --> 27:07.840
Also called beaches.

27:08.400 --> 27:16.240
Also called beaches. So I guess maybe act more like Mark Twain that that your friends won't see that

27:16.240 --> 27:22.000
coming yet. You know, don't, don't sweat it too much. Here's what I would tell you. Don't start

27:22.000 --> 27:27.440
second guessing who you've been for, because it can feel like that, because it can feel like that.

27:27.440 --> 27:32.560
Sometimes like, oh, this is a front. This is a character, but everybody has a little bit of that

27:32.560 --> 27:37.040
because your true self, you say for the times when it's just you.

27:37.040 --> 27:44.080
I think, yeah, I think everybody, especially in like college after college period goes through

27:44.080 --> 27:49.680
that. Is this the real me or am I just being the me? My friends want me to be that you're getting

27:49.680 --> 27:57.200
too deep here. Just be you be happy. Yeah. Eat, pray, love, eat, pray, love, pray, love, go to India,

27:57.200 --> 28:02.160
India. Is that where they go? Yeah. And eat, pray, love three of them. Eat, pray and love.

28:02.160 --> 28:07.200
I'll go to India together. It's like sex in the city, but there's a lot more eating. Well,

28:07.200 --> 28:30.240
do you know where we're going to go? Uh, tell me the money. So, uh, and first of all, we have some

28:30.240 --> 28:38.640
wedding well wishes to Jake, Aaron, and Lottie Young from Tom and Simon, who wanted us to know

28:38.640 --> 28:43.600
that they have two cats, Belle and Bowie, one of whom is presumably named after the musical star

28:43.600 --> 28:53.680
of Jake's favorite movie, Labyrinth, Belle and Sebastian. Okay. What? The Belle and Sebastian

28:53.680 --> 29:00.880
you're saying was in Labyrinth? Yeah. Right. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. You

29:00.880 --> 29:05.600
have said the dumbest thing that has ever been. I believe that's true. They're going to get divorced

29:05.600 --> 29:14.960
now. Bummer. Oh no. Good job. Oh man. Thanks for your money. You soon to be divorced lonely hearts.

29:14.960 --> 29:21.840
You give us money and we will give you lies in exchange. Yeah. Also, we want to wish a super

29:21.840 --> 29:28.480
happy birthday to Anthony Edwards, presumably not that Anthony Edwards from ER. Uh, that's from

29:28.480 --> 29:34.800
Melanie Lovelock, which is a great last name. Can we explore the possibility that she is wishing a

29:34.800 --> 29:40.160
TV show character a happy 36th birthday? All right. We got to get into this, this thing again.

29:40.160 --> 29:47.120
Anthony Edwards is a real guy, okay? Not a character. God damn it. God damn it. You did it

29:47.120 --> 29:56.080
again. I'm Dr. Anthony Edwards. I'm Dr. George Clooney. Do you need some medicine? I have it.

29:56.080 --> 30:02.560
So it's, it's Anthony's 36th birthday. Uh, a great run on the ER and many more birthdays

30:03.120 --> 30:12.640
to come. Uh, we also have Bloody Fantastical. Um, that is a new dark fantasy slash horror podcast

30:12.640 --> 30:21.520
that's got violence and teeth and sex and fantasy. Plus there's English, an English guy with a set of

30:21.520 --> 30:27.440
pipes that will quote, I've been paid to read this, melt your socks right off. I cannot attest

30:27.440 --> 30:33.920
to that personally. Uh, my, I do not wear socks. I'm more of a Senex type of guy or maybe like a

30:33.920 --> 30:40.240
slipper in the home. But, um, I would like to think that my socks would burn, not melt unless

30:40.240 --> 30:47.200
they're plastic socks. What was that? Senex? Senex? Senex, they're, they're sandal shoes.

30:48.080 --> 30:53.600
Bottoms of them are sandals. The tops are just, I don't know. I think they're like hippie shirts

30:53.600 --> 30:58.160
that they cut up real thin and then sew them together into shoes. They're like, how can the

30:58.160 --> 31:05.200
bottoms be sandals? Like without the sandals, but without the top part, it's just the sole of a shoe.

31:05.200 --> 31:10.320
You're talking about water socks right now. No, you're wearing aqua shoes around your house. Do

31:10.320 --> 31:14.880
you wear these out of the house? What? Yeah, they're like the socks. They're like socks you

31:14.880 --> 31:20.640
can wear outdoors. Socks are socks you can wear outdoors. Everything you're saying is bad.

31:22.240 --> 31:30.240
They look great. It's a real beachy feel. Check out bloody fantastical.com or subscribe on iTunes.

31:30.240 --> 31:36.080
I can't do a jingle. I'm too fucking angry about you wearing beach shoes outside of your house at

31:36.080 --> 31:42.480
not beach. You don't live on the beach, Todd. That's your beach name. I love, I love that beachy

31:42.480 --> 31:48.240
feel. You have hookah shell, anklets, bracelets, and a necklace. Five, hey, five different hookah

31:48.240 --> 31:52.480
shells. If hacking is good enough for our Lord and savior, I can wear hemp sandal shoes.

31:52.480 --> 31:59.040
Think about it. Let me get my key box. Just think about what you said. Send me on my way.

31:59.040 --> 32:02.080
Have we reached the new segment where we just do rusted root impressions?

32:08.080 --> 32:15.920
That's all I got. Now, Griffin, you have, rather than permanently stop doing jingles forever-

32:15.920 --> 32:20.000
I came very close to just smashing my guitar and never doing jingles.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.200
Last week. To just smashing my guitar and never doing jingles again.

32:24.400 --> 32:29.680
But Griffin has agreed to continue to do jingles, but only for corporate companies.

32:29.680 --> 32:33.680
He's sold out. Instead of human beings. I am not-

32:33.680 --> 32:37.600
Because he realized it's ridiculous for human beings to have jingles. That's what he said.

32:39.040 --> 32:44.240
I'm Michael. Michael's got the best hair in town. Everybody knows it's Michael.

32:44.240 --> 32:48.960
Like that doesn't happen. I can't do that anymore.

32:48.960 --> 32:53.520
So this week, Griffin's gonna do the jingle for bloodyfantastical.com.

32:55.120 --> 32:59.600
All right. You say you're done with vampire romance.

33:01.440 --> 33:10.160
I'm not so sure. Because you haven't heard Bloody Fantastical. It's love and vampirism

33:10.160 --> 33:18.240
is pure. We're talking about dark fantasy and horror. We're talking about violence and teeth

33:18.240 --> 33:24.720
and sex. It's got a bonus English gentleman who himself might be a vampire. No wait,

33:24.720 --> 33:28.800
he just has bad teeth. Oh shit, that was kind of racist.

33:28.800 --> 33:38.240
You paid your money and then I said a racist thing about you.

33:38.240 --> 33:44.560
Bloodyfantastical.com. I'm sorry about the racist thing.

33:44.560 --> 33:48.560
I am about to go to my junior year of college. My summer job has not paid well.

33:49.120 --> 33:53.840
I'm heavily considering selling marijuana when I get back to school to make some extra cheddar.

33:53.840 --> 33:59.360
Is this a bad idea? I am also a heavy marijuana smoker myself.

33:59.360 --> 34:03.600
Great, great. How's this business plan come along so far?

34:03.600 --> 34:07.280
So far your business does not sound good. I want to open up a bakery,

34:07.280 --> 34:10.480
but I'm pretty much going to eat all of the bread myself.

34:10.480 --> 34:12.960
Love brownies. So I'm just, that's the situation.

34:13.840 --> 34:16.640
Listen, you know, you know who they don't let run the tricks factory?

34:16.640 --> 34:22.160
Tricks rabbit. Yeah, he'll, he'll chop them all down.

34:25.680 --> 34:33.600
All the best business plan, Google, Google was founded when Dr. Google was super pot high.

34:33.600 --> 34:36.160
Really, really, really pot high. He was like, oh, I got an idea.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.920
The thing about it though, the reason that didn't work out is he loved to eat Googles.

34:41.920 --> 34:48.960
He was addicted to Googles and he was addicted to searching.

34:49.840 --> 34:54.400
But, but see, that was a good thing because that searching was on an inexhaustible product.

34:54.960 --> 35:02.960
I just don't see how you make the line between like, I'm going to go smoke some marijuana

35:03.520 --> 35:06.880
and I'm not going to smoke that, that I'm going to sell to people.

35:06.880 --> 35:09.440
I'm going to just smoke it. I mean, here's the thing.

35:09.440 --> 35:13.600
I hate, I hate to be a stick in the mud, but of course it's not a good idea, dude.

35:13.600 --> 35:16.080
It's, it's illegal. It's like pretty illegal.

35:16.080 --> 35:17.920
It's like a pretty illegal thing that you can do.

35:17.920 --> 35:22.560
Not the most illegal place. You pretty much get caught doing that.

35:22.560 --> 35:24.800
You're out of college. You got the game.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.320
Maybe he's good at football. You don't know.

35:28.320 --> 35:29.920
All right. That's fair. Hold on.

35:29.920 --> 35:32.400
You're allowed to, you're allowed to just sell weed.

35:32.400 --> 35:40.960
You can do it. It is a fucking lawless old west style debauchery got to get down on sports.

35:41.520 --> 35:47.360
You got to get up. You just get the pigskin, kick it through the upright

35:48.720 --> 35:50.400
fork. You know, the big fork at the end.

35:50.400 --> 35:51.040
Yeah, sure.

35:51.040 --> 35:52.320
The score, kick it through that.

35:52.320 --> 35:52.560
Yeah.

35:52.560 --> 35:57.600
Get, kick it through the score fork and get some girls full, full bacchanal.

35:57.600 --> 36:01.440
Um, I, you know, we can't tell you to sell weed.

36:01.440 --> 36:05.440
Obviously we have a lot riding on this program.

36:05.440 --> 36:09.920
We can't go back to prison, but we can't tell you to smoke, to sell weed.

36:09.920 --> 36:13.200
We can't tell you the best way to sell weed,

36:13.840 --> 36:20.720
which is definitely by hiding it in those Mighty Max play sets and selling them on eBay.

36:20.720 --> 36:21.600
Okay.

36:21.600 --> 36:25.520
You just sneak, there's so many secret chambers in that Mighty Max play set.

36:25.520 --> 36:28.480
You just sneak a little bit of conge in there and then.

36:28.480 --> 36:31.360
No, don't do it at all.

36:32.000 --> 36:32.480
Yeah, don't.

36:32.480 --> 36:35.600
How do you hint, how do you hint that in the eBay listing though?

36:35.600 --> 36:37.920
Say he's got quite a yard.

36:37.920 --> 36:41.280
Mighty Max has got quite the lawn in here.

36:41.280 --> 36:44.240
He's got a real, a real forest.

36:44.240 --> 36:45.120
Filled with pot.

36:46.080 --> 36:46.640
Oh no.

36:46.640 --> 36:50.800
This Mighty Max is mighty green.

36:51.840 --> 36:52.560
Green.

36:52.560 --> 36:59.840
This is, this is his dankest adventure yet.

36:59.840 --> 37:02.640
Fighting his nemesis, the sticky icky.

37:02.640 --> 37:02.960
Yeah.

37:05.120 --> 37:10.480
Um, I, you, I, I, I know that selling weed, I can't pass it.

37:10.480 --> 37:13.040
Apparently someone's doing it cause everybody's got weed.

37:13.040 --> 37:18.400
Well, I imagine it's gotta be like a, it's, it's like most things that are illegal.

37:18.400 --> 37:19.120
A quick buck.

37:19.760 --> 37:20.080
Yeah.

37:20.080 --> 37:23.280
Like, but it's still such a bad idea.

37:23.280 --> 37:28.080
Cause the consequences I think outweigh the, like, I've made some extra cheddar.

37:29.040 --> 37:31.680
But also I went to prison for a little while.

37:31.680 --> 37:34.240
What you need to define as a chemistry teacher who cook for you.

37:34.240 --> 37:34.480
Exactly.

37:34.480 --> 37:35.680
Or I guess in this case, like a.

37:36.480 --> 37:37.280
Botanist.

37:37.280 --> 37:39.680
A botanist who will grow for you.

37:39.680 --> 37:42.400
A down on his luck botanist, which I'm pretty sure is all of them.

37:42.400 --> 37:44.320
Pretty much all botanists everywhere.

37:44.320 --> 37:47.760
Um, you, you, you're not thinking of the long game, sir.

37:47.760 --> 37:50.880
Mr. Form spring because you're going to need.

37:51.840 --> 37:54.000
You're going to need a new identity.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.080
You're going to need a drug dealer identity.

37:56.080 --> 37:57.280
Have you even thought about that?

37:57.280 --> 37:58.800
What's your drug dealer name is going to be?

37:58.800 --> 38:01.920
Who's the, who's the best drug dealer name that you guys know in real life

38:02.800 --> 38:03.600
of the drug dealers?

38:03.600 --> 38:05.840
You guys know what's, what's the best, what's the best name?

38:06.640 --> 38:07.120
Dr.

38:07.120 --> 38:07.440
Shoot.

38:08.560 --> 38:09.200
That's not real.

38:09.200 --> 38:10.480
Nobody fucks around with Dr.

38:10.480 --> 38:13.440
Shoot for obvious reasons.

38:13.440 --> 38:14.640
Travis, your turn.

38:14.640 --> 38:15.920
General Stabenstein.

38:15.920 --> 38:16.160
Yeah.

38:16.160 --> 38:19.600
I only know one drug dealer in Huntington.

38:19.600 --> 38:20.720
His name is Nike.

38:20.720 --> 38:21.360
That's all I got.

38:21.360 --> 38:22.560
That's really good.

38:22.560 --> 38:24.240
That's pretty good, right?

38:24.240 --> 38:25.600
Cause it's already branded.

38:25.600 --> 38:26.960
Like you don't even have to advertise.

38:26.960 --> 38:28.400
You got the advertisements covered.

38:29.680 --> 38:31.600
This is my drug dealer, vitamin water.

38:31.600 --> 38:31.920
Yeah.

38:33.040 --> 38:36.560
You got to find some way to command respect so that people don't knock you over

38:36.560 --> 38:39.680
and take all your, take all your jazz cigarettes from you.

38:41.120 --> 38:45.920
Cause what I know about heavy marijuana smokers is those guys are fighters.

38:45.920 --> 38:47.440
Just spry and limber.

38:48.320 --> 38:50.880
You can't smoke it if you're selling it.

38:50.880 --> 38:51.600
You can't.

38:51.600 --> 38:53.200
You absolutely can't.

38:53.920 --> 38:57.680
You've got to make, and hey, you know, this is a great opportunity.

38:57.680 --> 38:59.680
You're about to make a bad life choice.

38:59.680 --> 39:02.800
Why not counterbalance it with a good life choice?

39:02.800 --> 39:07.200
I guarantee that if you stop smoking for a while so that you could sell it,

39:07.840 --> 39:09.440
it would take care of the second one.

39:10.080 --> 39:14.480
You'd be like, oh wait, now that I've cleared this haze, this is a bad idea.

39:14.480 --> 39:16.640
No, I think it's fine.

39:16.640 --> 39:19.440
Just don't, don't smoke it.

39:20.560 --> 39:24.560
Maybe you could do a similar idea that's quite legal.

39:24.560 --> 39:28.400
And since you obviously know a bunch of other marijuana smokers,

39:28.400 --> 39:31.600
start a door to door hostess cupcake business.

39:31.600 --> 39:35.440
You're talking about a food delivery service for high people?

39:35.440 --> 39:35.760
Yeah.

39:35.760 --> 39:38.080
You just, you just bring munchies to them.

39:38.080 --> 39:38.480
Yeah.

39:38.480 --> 39:39.600
You guys need Starburst?

39:40.720 --> 39:41.040
I don't know.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.160
You could drive them places.

39:42.160 --> 39:44.320
That would be fun, pot chauffeur.

39:44.320 --> 39:48.800
Oh, you could sit next to them in class and movies when they start freaking out

39:48.800 --> 39:51.040
and you just like pat their knee and say, it's going to be cool.

39:51.040 --> 39:54.160
Carry a cool damp rag with you everywhere you go.

39:54.160 --> 39:55.120
Shh, shh, shh.

39:55.120 --> 39:58.640
All right, do you mean when they freak out on hallucinogenic marijuana?

39:58.640 --> 39:59.920
Is that what you're saying?

39:59.920 --> 40:02.400
Or when they start breathing heavily and they're like, I can't breathe,

40:02.400 --> 40:03.440
my throat's closing up.

40:03.440 --> 40:04.400
And you're like, no, it's not.

40:04.400 --> 40:04.720
You're fine.

40:04.720 --> 40:05.200
You're fine.

40:05.200 --> 40:06.640
This is just a SpongeBob movie.

40:06.640 --> 40:07.120
Don't worry.

40:07.120 --> 40:09.200
Because that is what you would be watching.

40:09.200 --> 40:09.700
Mm-hmm.

40:10.480 --> 40:11.760
Don't sell marijuana.

40:11.760 --> 40:12.240
Don't do it.

40:12.240 --> 40:13.200
You're in college.

40:14.080 --> 40:14.640
But if you do-

40:14.640 --> 40:16.160
Just finish college.

40:16.160 --> 40:17.520
And then sell marijuana.

40:17.520 --> 40:18.400
Once you get your business degree-

40:18.400 --> 40:19.520
You don't have to sell marijuana.

40:19.520 --> 40:21.200
You're going to have a college degree.

40:21.200 --> 40:21.700
Yeah.

40:22.640 --> 40:23.680
Times are tough, Justin.

40:23.680 --> 40:27.040
It kind of, but it negates the purpose of having a college degree

40:27.040 --> 40:31.040
if you also have to list on your application that you have been arrested

40:31.040 --> 40:32.480
for felony charges.

40:32.480 --> 40:34.240
Can I suggest that you do that?

40:34.240 --> 40:37.280
Just stop going to college.

40:37.280 --> 40:39.360
Because you're already in the highest paying career

40:39.360 --> 40:40.720
you're going to be able to net.

40:40.720 --> 40:42.160
Just go with this lifestyle.

40:42.720 --> 40:45.440
You just flipped a 180 sentence to sentence.

40:46.000 --> 40:46.880
Write it dirty.

40:46.880 --> 40:47.760
That's all I'm saying.

40:47.760 --> 40:48.260
Get-

40:49.120 --> 40:50.960
Listen, regulators, mount up.

40:51.520 --> 40:52.160
Don't listen.

40:52.160 --> 40:52.720
Hear me out.

40:53.760 --> 40:54.400
Hear me out.

40:54.400 --> 40:55.120
I'm hearing.

40:55.600 --> 40:56.320
Go full criminal.

40:58.320 --> 41:00.560
You're saying like, super criminal.

41:00.560 --> 41:01.040
I-

41:01.040 --> 41:02.720
What do you mean, super criminal?

41:02.720 --> 41:04.320
Super criminal.

41:04.320 --> 41:06.320
Why stop at marijuana?

41:06.320 --> 41:08.240
Go get some fucking sweet code book.

41:09.200 --> 41:10.400
Rob a bank.

41:10.400 --> 41:11.440
Stab a dude.

41:11.440 --> 41:12.880
It's time to break bad.

41:12.880 --> 41:21.280
Listen, the thing that is upsetting us about the idea of you selling drugs

41:21.280 --> 41:22.720
is you have so much to lose.

41:23.360 --> 41:26.720
You've got to get to rock bottom and then-

41:26.720 --> 41:27.680
Climb your way back up.

41:27.680 --> 41:28.880
You'll be unstoppable.

41:28.880 --> 41:36.720
The time has come for you to quit college and like, break really bad.

41:37.600 --> 41:40.400
Do you know why they brought down Nancy Botlin from Weeds?

41:40.400 --> 41:42.000
Because she got family to worry about.

41:42.000 --> 41:42.880
She didn't have that family.

41:42.880 --> 41:45.760
She'd still be on the streets selling.

41:46.640 --> 41:47.140
Yeah.

41:48.160 --> 41:53.040
Well, I stopped watching Weeds a few seasons back, but I'm assuming that that's what happens.

41:54.400 --> 41:56.800
God damn, I want to go have some marijuana.

41:56.800 --> 42:00.080
This question got me in the mood.

42:00.800 --> 42:02.640
Hey, who do I talk to about marijuana?

42:03.520 --> 42:05.040
Where do you get it anymore?

42:05.040 --> 42:06.160
It's legal now, right?

42:06.160 --> 42:07.360
It's pretty much everywhere.

42:07.360 --> 42:08.160
More or less.

42:08.160 --> 42:09.280
Why don't you sell salvia?

42:09.280 --> 42:10.640
Isn't salvia legal?

42:10.640 --> 42:11.600
Fuck, don't sell salvia.

42:11.600 --> 42:14.880
No, that would be doing people a public service because nothing will make you want to never

42:14.880 --> 42:16.320
do drugs again like salvia.

42:17.040 --> 42:17.540
Yeah.

42:18.240 --> 42:18.960
Oh, that's great.

42:18.960 --> 42:22.880
I just had tea with the devil and he told me he was going to kill me if I ever did this again.

42:22.880 --> 42:24.560
Yeah, the devil is going to give me a prostate exam,

42:24.560 --> 42:26.720
so I think I'm going to go lay down in a room for a year.

42:27.520 --> 42:28.240
Okay, cool.

42:28.800 --> 42:29.600
Bye.

42:29.600 --> 42:30.080
Good experience.

42:30.080 --> 42:30.960
Bye, everyone.

42:30.960 --> 42:31.600
Good night.

42:31.600 --> 42:33.040
Hey, great Halloween, everyone.

42:33.680 --> 42:37.280
Time to make a new set of friends because you all saw me cry and pee myself.

42:38.880 --> 42:40.560
I guess I'm not a character anymore.

42:40.560 --> 42:42.960
Now I'm that guy who pees himself.

42:42.960 --> 42:46.160
And rocks in the corner while the devil touches his butthole.

42:46.160 --> 42:47.040
Hey, how about a yahoo?

42:47.840 --> 42:48.880
Yeah, I'm ready.

42:49.520 --> 42:53.280
Okay, this yahoo is sent in by Mike Burnsteel.

42:53.280 --> 42:54.800
Thank you, Mike.

42:54.800 --> 42:56.160
It's a pretty cool name.

42:56.160 --> 42:56.400
Huh?

42:57.120 --> 42:57.840
Pretty cool name.

42:57.840 --> 42:59.200
Yeah, yeah.

42:59.200 --> 42:59.600
I like it.

42:59.600 --> 43:01.760
You know what, now that you mention it, it is a pretty cool name.

43:01.760 --> 43:05.120
It's by yahoo answers user PDFGhost who says,

43:07.520 --> 43:10.960
what are some good ways to look cool at the urinal?

43:14.400 --> 43:17.120
I'm trying to seem cool at work when I'm at the urinal.

43:17.120 --> 43:20.000
Lately, while I'm peeing, I've been putting my hands in my pockets.

43:20.000 --> 43:23.280
I've thought about resting my elbow on the wall and putting my head against my hand,

43:23.280 --> 43:26.560
just kind of chilling, acting like it's not even a big deal and I'm peeing.

43:26.560 --> 43:27.600
NBD.

43:27.600 --> 43:28.960
Any other ideas?

43:29.680 --> 43:31.600
It's not like I'm trying to hook up with any dudes.

43:31.600 --> 43:34.880
I just want people to think, man, that's a chill dude.

43:34.880 --> 43:36.160
And everyone has to go to the bathroom.

43:36.160 --> 43:38.080
So that's where you see the widest variety of people.

43:40.640 --> 43:43.280
Bring your office chair with you and just kind of recline.

43:43.280 --> 43:45.040
Oh, God, yes.

43:45.040 --> 43:48.640
Just roll in there like, what's up, chilling, chill dude.

43:48.640 --> 43:51.680
Oh, and go to the tiny kid's urinal.

43:51.680 --> 43:54.160
And you know, just like lean back in your chair and hit it.

43:54.160 --> 43:54.880
It looks huge.

43:54.880 --> 43:56.960
Can you have a Mai Tai in your hand?

43:56.960 --> 44:00.000
I don't know how cool your office is, but if you can have a Mai Tai in your hand while

44:00.000 --> 44:04.960
you pee from your chair into a child's urinal while your boss watches you.

44:06.480 --> 44:09.760
If you can do it hands-free and put both hands up and it just says,

44:09.760 --> 44:11.840
what the fuck, it's summer, chill dude.

44:12.480 --> 44:13.600
And maybe like hang ten.

44:13.600 --> 44:16.080
And then you're just like, ah.

44:16.080 --> 44:21.280
If you can do some wall push-ups while you're doing it, like get that, get diesel.

44:21.840 --> 44:22.480
Get pumped.

44:22.480 --> 44:25.280
Is it too complicated to do a touchdown dance?

44:26.880 --> 44:29.200
As you're, like when you're done or what?

44:29.200 --> 44:30.640
No, like as you're doing it.

44:31.920 --> 44:32.240
Yeah.

44:33.600 --> 44:37.040
I mean, it seems like a premature celebration because you don't know how long it's going to go.

44:37.040 --> 44:38.800
Or if you're going to go that dribble.

44:38.800 --> 44:39.920
If you do a bad job of it.

44:39.920 --> 44:42.800
Um, can you plank?

44:45.680 --> 44:49.840
Oh, you could if you had those like wall divider things and you just laid across them.

44:49.840 --> 44:54.160
And you tucked your wormy in one of the toilets while you aimed down.

44:54.160 --> 44:56.000
While you peed straight down.

44:57.360 --> 44:59.280
But if there are other people in that bathroom.

44:59.280 --> 45:01.440
I mean, if there are other people at the other urinals that you're planking on,

45:01.440 --> 45:02.480
that's going to be a scene.

45:02.480 --> 45:04.560
That's going to be a whole ordeal.

45:05.520 --> 45:07.360
And what if they got one of those big pee troughs?

45:07.360 --> 45:10.240
I think there's laying in the trough.

45:10.240 --> 45:11.040
That would be perfect.

45:11.600 --> 45:12.480
I've seen some people.

45:12.480 --> 45:16.080
I've seen some people at a Cubs game that just go to sleep in that trough.

45:16.080 --> 45:17.040
Daddy, is he planking?

45:17.040 --> 45:18.000
Like, no, son.

45:19.040 --> 45:19.440
No, son.

45:19.440 --> 45:20.160
He's half dead.

45:21.520 --> 45:22.160
That's JB.

45:22.160 --> 45:24.000
You gotta pee around him.

45:27.040 --> 45:30.720
Although, although if you would look cool, peeing on another guy is cool.

45:35.040 --> 45:35.760
Who's the boss?

45:36.320 --> 45:36.880
Who's the boss?

45:36.880 --> 45:38.960
Oh, wait, you are the boss of this company.

45:38.960 --> 45:40.720
I'll go clean out my desk.

45:42.240 --> 45:42.960
Sorry about your desk.

45:42.960 --> 45:44.960
Maybe just move your desk into the bathroom.

45:46.320 --> 45:46.800
Yeah.

45:46.800 --> 45:47.840
Don't pee in a urinal.

45:49.040 --> 45:51.360
Take Dominion back over your urination.

45:51.360 --> 45:53.360
Just pee in the middle of a conversation.

45:55.440 --> 45:56.240
Pee in your pants.

45:56.240 --> 45:57.040
I better go watch this.

45:57.040 --> 45:58.800
Hey, Bradley, can you hold on for just one second?

46:00.000 --> 46:00.640
Okay, go on.

46:00.640 --> 46:04.800
Can you pee in your pants and then put your pants in the urinal while everybody's watching?

46:04.800 --> 46:07.440
And wash them in there like a little washing machine?

46:07.440 --> 46:08.160
I'll get this later.

46:08.160 --> 46:08.960
Or just leave them behind.

46:08.960 --> 46:10.480
Yeah, I'll pick it up at five.

46:10.480 --> 46:11.040
Hey, Jerry.

46:11.920 --> 46:12.960
How are things in accounts?

46:14.800 --> 46:20.000
When Bradley Cooper took the Limitless Pill, do you think he came up with the coolest way to ever use the urinal?

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Can you just do what he does in that movie?

46:22.000 --> 46:23.040
So you've seen the movie, right?

46:23.840 --> 46:26.160
Have not seen it, but does he use a urinal at one point?

46:26.160 --> 46:28.240
He uses all the urinals.

46:28.240 --> 46:29.680
All of them at once.

46:30.560 --> 46:34.560
Limitless Pill gives you five dicks that are very, very cool.

46:34.560 --> 46:36.000
Very accurate each one.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.960
You know how human beings only use 20% of their dicks?

46:40.960 --> 46:44.480
Bradley Cooper uses 100% of his five dicks.

46:44.480 --> 46:46.800
He does 500% all the time.

46:46.800 --> 46:48.080
That's what Limitless is all about.

46:50.400 --> 46:51.280
Is that what it's about?

46:52.320 --> 46:55.600
To be fair, if that's what it was about, it would have been a way better movie.

46:56.560 --> 46:57.680
Just a ring of dicks.

46:58.640 --> 47:00.000
A never ending ring of dicks.

47:01.360 --> 47:02.400
Like a Cthulhu.

47:02.400 --> 47:05.680
It's a very Cthulhu-esque situation.

47:09.040 --> 47:10.720
So I guess those are some cool things you can do.

47:10.720 --> 47:11.360
Can you flex?

47:11.920 --> 47:13.440
Can you thumb wrestle the guy next to you?

47:13.440 --> 47:14.800
There's so many options.

47:14.800 --> 47:16.400
Can you thumb wrestle yourself?

47:17.520 --> 47:19.360
You can scream at the top of your lungs.

47:20.000 --> 47:20.880
Scream not again.

47:21.680 --> 47:22.960
Or I finally got it.

47:24.320 --> 47:27.040
Can you open up a window and pee out the window?

47:27.840 --> 47:31.040
And put your arms up in a manner that says I don't fucking care, man.

47:31.040 --> 47:32.080
I think that part's good.

47:32.080 --> 47:34.160
I think that part is non-negotiable.

47:34.160 --> 47:34.640
You gotta put your pants-

47:34.640 --> 47:36.400
It's gotta be like, fuck it.

47:36.400 --> 47:37.520
Just pee in.

47:37.520 --> 47:41.920
And I do love dropping pants and underwear.

47:41.920 --> 47:42.560
Hey, by the way-

47:42.560 --> 47:43.920
Oh, be a girl.

47:43.920 --> 47:46.320
I think it's a pretty dope way to win at the urinal.

47:46.320 --> 47:48.080
If you're a girl, I think this day is yours.

47:48.800 --> 47:49.920
Hey Dave, check this out.

47:49.920 --> 47:50.560
High five.

47:50.560 --> 47:51.040
I got it.

47:51.760 --> 47:56.640
You go to the stall and you sit down to pee, but you leave the stall door open.

47:59.680 --> 48:00.640
Oh, occupy.

48:00.640 --> 48:02.560
Oh, no, don't worry.

48:02.560 --> 48:03.280
What are you looking at?

48:03.280 --> 48:04.240
Hey, we're all dudes.

48:04.240 --> 48:05.920
Hey, all dudes here.

48:05.920 --> 48:08.960
I'm just taking a break, taking a relaxer while I go.

48:09.600 --> 48:10.400
This one's for me.

48:11.840 --> 48:13.280
This Tucker's for me.

48:14.080 --> 48:16.400
Does anybody have an O Magazine I can peruse?

48:18.480 --> 48:21.120
Got some good housekeeping in here if you guys want to read.

48:21.120 --> 48:21.760
Oh, you can't read.

48:21.760 --> 48:23.280
You're standing up, dummies.

48:23.280 --> 48:24.720
You still use urinals?

48:24.720 --> 48:25.360
What a joke.

48:26.080 --> 48:27.120
I love this luxury.

48:27.120 --> 48:31.200
Like many of your fans, I'm seeking a little advice about the ladies,

48:31.200 --> 48:33.520
specifically coworker type ladies.

48:33.520 --> 48:36.000
I'm really into this girl and I'm pretty sure she's into me,

48:36.000 --> 48:40.320
but a lot of friends have told me that I shouldn't try dating coworkers.

48:40.880 --> 48:45.520
Do you guys have any advice you could give me, bewildered in Brooklyn?

48:46.160 --> 48:46.880
What is your job?

48:46.880 --> 48:48.320
I'm so angry at this person.

48:49.040 --> 48:49.520
Why?

48:49.520 --> 48:50.960
You gotta give us some deets, yo.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.680
It depends on where you work.

48:53.680 --> 48:54.400
If you work at a blockbuster-

48:54.400 --> 48:54.960
Right, that's key.

48:54.960 --> 48:59.280
If you work at a blockbuster video, then you should be fucking like the world is ending,

48:59.280 --> 49:00.800
because it is for blockbuster video.

49:02.400 --> 49:03.120
If you guys are-

49:03.120 --> 49:05.120
At least your financial solvency is ending.

49:05.120 --> 49:08.560
If your lawyer partners, if your partner's at a lawyer firm,

49:08.560 --> 49:11.920
you probably shouldn't fuck because then you'd have to divorce the firm

49:11.920 --> 49:13.040
if something bad happened.

49:13.760 --> 49:15.120
Then where would your clients go?

49:15.120 --> 49:17.920
I know you and I are both lawyer partners,

49:19.120 --> 49:20.720
but I really think this is going somewhere.

49:20.720 --> 49:27.200
This fall on NBC, Lawyer Partners, they like Law and each other, and they kiss.

49:28.640 --> 49:29.120
Watch it.

49:29.120 --> 49:30.240
And Tom Cavanagh's in it.

49:30.240 --> 49:31.440
It's got Tom Cavanagh.

49:31.440 --> 49:32.160
Of course he is.

49:34.240 --> 49:35.440
I think you ask her out.

49:36.960 --> 49:39.040
We know nothing about this girl.

49:39.040 --> 49:39.360
She could be-

49:39.360 --> 49:39.920
I know.

49:39.920 --> 49:41.040
She could be poison.

49:42.560 --> 49:43.920
Like literal poison?

49:43.920 --> 49:45.760
Like her skin is toxic?

49:45.760 --> 49:52.800
I'm saying that she has a big butt and a smile as I'm saying it's going to be a bad scene for you.

49:52.800 --> 49:53.280
Probably.

49:53.280 --> 49:54.400
I don't know.

49:55.520 --> 49:56.160
It depends.

49:56.160 --> 49:59.920
Okay, let's, there's so many factors here.

49:59.920 --> 50:04.320
But let's say if this is a non-disposable job, by which I mean, it's a job-

50:04.320 --> 50:05.440
Like a career.

50:05.440 --> 50:07.200
A career, thank you, Travis, yes.

50:07.200 --> 50:13.520
If it's your career, I don't think intra-career dating is such a great idea,

50:13.520 --> 50:16.000
but here's the thing though.

50:16.560 --> 50:20.400
Here's the thing, and this is where maybe I'm out on my own here.

50:21.360 --> 50:30.000
If she is that special somebody, if she's your special one, then you move heaven and earth.

50:30.000 --> 50:31.520
You quit your lawyer job.

50:31.520 --> 50:33.360
You get a new lawyer partner.

50:33.360 --> 50:36.880
If she's that special somebody, but you need to make sure,

50:36.880 --> 50:42.320
I think you need to get to know her as well as you can in the office situation.

50:42.320 --> 50:44.880
You can date in the office.

50:44.880 --> 50:47.520
I think you got to quit your lawyer job for this girl.

50:47.520 --> 50:53.040
You got to open up a bowling alley in your hometown and just chase her down.

50:53.040 --> 50:54.640
This fall, Tom Cavanagh.

50:54.640 --> 50:57.360
Catch it, NBC, late night, eight o'clock, Sundays.

50:57.360 --> 50:57.840
Catch it.

50:57.840 --> 50:58.480
Please catch it.

50:59.840 --> 51:00.560
And buy a book.

51:00.560 --> 51:01.040
Please catch it.

51:01.040 --> 51:01.600
Buy the book.

51:01.600 --> 51:02.880
For the love of God.

51:02.880 --> 51:03.680
Buy the book.

51:03.680 --> 51:05.120
This is Ed, the book.

51:06.560 --> 51:08.800
I wrote a novelization of the TV show.

51:08.800 --> 51:13.440
I wrote a novelization of a show that was kind of okay that got canceled a decade ago.

51:13.440 --> 51:13.920
Please buy it.

51:13.920 --> 51:16.560
And also Michael Ian Black was in it, so you should check it out.

51:16.560 --> 51:20.480
Michael Ian Black isn't in the book per se, but his name is.

51:21.680 --> 51:23.520
Just over and over again.

51:23.520 --> 51:24.720
It's the title of every chapter.

51:24.720 --> 51:25.360
Please buy it.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.320
Hey, anybody smell that?

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
I smell another Pulitzer from Mark Twain.

51:34.800 --> 51:37.680
Coming this fall from Mark Twain, Ed, the book.

51:37.680 --> 51:38.880
Ed, the book.

51:38.880 --> 51:42.640
You love Beaches, the book, the movie, the book, the movie, Beaches, the book.

51:43.520 --> 51:47.120
Remember when you loved the book of the movie, Beaches, by Mark Twain?

51:48.080 --> 51:49.680
Get ready to experience magic again.

51:50.240 --> 51:54.320
When he takes, takes to the page with his quill.

51:54.320 --> 51:55.760
Puts it in the paper.

51:57.200 --> 52:00.160
Foo Fighters, come on up, because you won best theme song for a book.

52:02.480 --> 52:03.440
Every time you open it.

52:03.440 --> 52:08.080
I'm in the sky tonight.

52:08.080 --> 52:10.640
I, I think that you can take co-workers.

52:12.560 --> 52:15.520
But I think Justin is right and it has to be worth it.

52:15.520 --> 52:18.400
It can't be like, oh, you know, we kind of click a little bit, I guess.

52:18.400 --> 52:19.760
And I think I could boner.

52:19.760 --> 52:27.200
So you could get a lot of the information that you need by going to like business lunch.

52:27.200 --> 52:29.040
Like, do you want to go to business lunch today?

52:29.040 --> 52:32.080
And, you know, that's your talk.

52:32.080 --> 52:33.520
You pick things up.

52:33.520 --> 52:36.720
There's nothing sexually threatening about taking a girl to Chili's.

52:38.080 --> 52:39.760
She will be none the wiser.

52:39.760 --> 52:43.920
Especially if she's in like a pantsuit and you're in a suit.

52:45.040 --> 52:47.840
Clearly we're out of place here, the TGI Fridays.

52:47.840 --> 52:51.520
I have a negative boner right now.

52:51.520 --> 52:52.480
My boner went in.

52:53.440 --> 52:56.800
That, that it'll be the situation where the server will say,

52:56.800 --> 52:58.480
how are these checks being split up?

52:58.480 --> 53:00.640
And you just laugh and laugh and laugh.

53:00.640 --> 53:01.920
Because of course you're going Dutch.

53:01.920 --> 53:02.320
Look at you.

53:02.320 --> 53:03.120
You're in business suits.

53:03.120 --> 53:04.640
She's wearing a pantsuit.

53:04.640 --> 53:05.200
She doesn't want you to pay for shit.

53:05.200 --> 53:07.520
I've got a briefcase here at TGI Fridays.

53:09.040 --> 53:14.080
I'm going to put my styrofoam container of steakums into my briefcase.

53:14.080 --> 53:16.800
I spilled chimmy rito sauce on these documents.

53:18.400 --> 53:20.400
Well, we're going to lose that big case.

53:20.400 --> 53:22.400
We're going to lose our big client.

53:22.400 --> 53:27.120
He will be put to death in the electric chair because of my sloppy eating.

53:28.160 --> 53:29.040
But she was right.

53:29.040 --> 53:30.480
The guac was worth it.

53:30.480 --> 53:32.160
I'd kill for it.

53:32.160 --> 53:33.040
And now we're in love.

53:35.680 --> 53:37.280
That is how I met your mother.

53:37.280 --> 53:39.200
The end of the show.

53:39.200 --> 53:40.320
Season eight, the end.

53:41.360 --> 53:42.640
Oh, Christ.

53:42.640 --> 53:46.400
Man, I want some marijuana and some chimmy ritos right now.

53:46.400 --> 53:48.160
This show is just filming with our issues.

53:48.720 --> 53:51.120
I'm not even sure chimmy ritos is real.

53:51.120 --> 53:51.920
Why do I hate it up?

53:51.920 --> 53:52.320
Sure they are.

53:52.320 --> 53:54.000
That's chimmy chonga doritos.

53:55.520 --> 53:56.640
It's a mashup.

53:56.640 --> 53:57.120
It's a food.

53:57.120 --> 53:58.880
Chimmy chonga blasted doritos.

53:58.880 --> 54:00.880
It's a food portmanteau.

54:00.880 --> 54:03.040
And also, Tom Cavanagh is there.

54:03.040 --> 54:05.680
Also, Tom Cavanagh is there in the sequel to Ed, the book.

54:06.640 --> 54:08.640
Ed closes down the bowling alley, opens up chilies.

54:12.480 --> 54:13.600
Do you guys know what day it is?

54:15.280 --> 54:16.160
Oh, shit.

54:16.160 --> 54:17.120
Oh, shit.

54:18.320 --> 54:21.680
It's going to be a long episode, but we got to do it because people have to be aware of

54:21.680 --> 54:23.120
the things that happen in August.

54:23.120 --> 54:24.240
What day is it, Griffin?

54:25.600 --> 54:26.560
What day is it?

54:26.560 --> 54:28.160
There's actually a list of days.

54:28.160 --> 54:28.880
It's a-

54:28.880 --> 54:29.840
No, I don't want-

54:29.840 --> 54:31.280
Lighthouse day.

54:31.280 --> 54:32.640
It's an assistant's dog day.

54:33.600 --> 54:35.840
Particularly preposterous packaging day.

54:35.840 --> 54:37.440
Oh, how whimsical.

54:37.440 --> 54:38.240
Oh, golly.

54:38.240 --> 54:40.480
How whimsical.

54:40.480 --> 54:45.200
That is actually the most foppish day of the year, so let's take a moment to celebrate that.

54:45.200 --> 54:48.960
Every month, Griffin chooses an awareness.

54:48.960 --> 54:51.520
Justin acts like he hates it, but I think he loves-

54:52.480 --> 54:53.760
Secretly, he loves it.

54:53.760 --> 54:56.480
So what, Griffin, have you pre-selected one, I hope, this month?

54:56.480 --> 54:58.080
I have, I have, I have.

54:58.080 --> 55:04.320
I mean, there's plenty of good options, like motorsports awareness month and celery, fennel,

55:04.320 --> 55:05.680
and cactus month.

55:05.680 --> 55:11.440
That's a lot of things for a month to have in it, but I think that what we need to go with-

55:11.440 --> 55:13.840
You're saying fennel should have its own month?

55:13.840 --> 55:16.800
I'm saying fennel, celery, and cactus should each have their own months and not be-

55:17.520 --> 55:19.280
I just don't know how cactus fits in there.

55:19.280 --> 55:20.240
It's kind of an odd manner.

55:20.240 --> 55:22.160
Yeah, I can eat celery and fennel.

55:22.160 --> 55:25.280
I won't like it, but I definitely can't eat cactus.

55:25.280 --> 55:26.320
I can just drink it.

55:26.320 --> 55:27.600
It is.

55:28.560 --> 55:30.080
Get ready for kindergarten month.

55:31.360 --> 55:38.320
We have a lot of pre-pre-pre-preteen listeners that I think we need to take care of their needs.

55:38.320 --> 55:43.120
Dear my brother, my brother, and me, I'm going to be a junior in kindergarten and I need some

55:43.120 --> 55:44.000
more cheddar.

55:44.000 --> 55:45.200
Can I sell marijuana?

55:48.080 --> 55:54.000
Get ready for kindergarten by finding a bodacious strain of marijuana that will take everyone to

55:54.000 --> 55:54.800
Hightown.

55:54.800 --> 55:55.200
Radical.

55:55.200 --> 55:57.840
Oh, this glue stick purple is delicious.

56:00.000 --> 56:01.520
Glue stick hookup?

56:01.520 --> 56:03.040
You want to go over there to Short Darrell?

56:07.120 --> 56:08.160
My brother, my brother, and me.

56:08.160 --> 56:11.520
What can we tell these kids to get them ready for-

56:11.520 --> 56:13.680
Because it's not just kindergarten, it's school.

56:13.680 --> 56:15.840
We're getting them ready for the idea of school.

56:17.600 --> 56:20.560
Hey, shit's about to get really bad for like 13 years.

56:20.560 --> 56:24.400
Get ready to not do all those things you wanted to do whenever you wanted to do them ever again

56:24.400 --> 56:25.120
for 13 years.

56:26.160 --> 56:27.120
You like cartoons?

56:27.120 --> 56:28.080
You're never going to see those again.

56:30.720 --> 56:32.560
The kids at school are going to know if your tan's fake.

56:34.880 --> 56:36.240
Don't let mommy spray tan you.

56:38.240 --> 56:39.120
Good color.

56:39.120 --> 56:39.680
Good base.

56:40.480 --> 56:42.800
You gotta get a good base before you go to kindergarten.

56:42.800 --> 56:43.280
That's so important.

56:43.280 --> 56:44.240
Gotta get a good base.

56:44.240 --> 56:46.240
You gotta get a beach's lunchbox.

56:46.960 --> 56:48.880
Something relevant for the kids.

56:49.760 --> 56:51.600
I don't even know what the- no joke.

56:51.600 --> 56:54.240
I don't even know what an appropriate lunchbox would be anymore.

56:55.280 --> 56:56.240
Do they do lunchboxes?

56:56.240 --> 56:58.720
Ah, fuck, they might not even do lunchboxes.

56:58.720 --> 57:00.560
They just all roll up with Clif Bars.

57:02.160 --> 57:03.840
Clif Bars and Mel Jeans.

57:07.840 --> 57:10.160
To be fair, I went to kindergarten in the OC, so-

57:10.160 --> 57:10.660
Yeah.

57:12.480 --> 57:15.040
Hey, teach, this water fountain fucking sucks.

57:15.040 --> 57:15.540
Sucks.

57:15.540 --> 57:16.960
Can I get a Brita in this bitch?

57:16.960 --> 57:17.760
Is he then filtered?

57:18.880 --> 57:20.560
I need it bubbly, bitch.

57:20.560 --> 57:22.000
Bubbly, bitch.

57:22.000 --> 57:22.960
Filter this.

57:22.960 --> 57:23.760
Filter this shit.

57:24.640 --> 57:25.200
I'm leaving.

57:26.080 --> 57:27.600
Where can my security guard sit?

57:29.280 --> 57:29.780
What?

57:30.320 --> 57:36.640
Do- okay, I really do feel like maybe the most important tip is find out if people still have

57:36.640 --> 57:37.360
lunchboxes.

57:38.400 --> 57:43.200
Because god damn, can you imagine being the one guy to roll up and like throw in the Explorer?

57:43.200 --> 57:43.700
Love it.

57:44.240 --> 57:45.760
I got my lunch in here.

57:45.760 --> 57:47.600
That could- that's going to be your whole identity.

57:47.600 --> 57:48.960
Because you can like throw it away and be like,

57:48.960 --> 57:51.440
Oh, it's an ironic lunchbox. That's how I'm meeting you guys.

57:51.440 --> 57:52.320
It's a joke.

57:52.320 --> 57:55.520
I'm one of those hipster kindergartners you read about.

57:55.520 --> 57:57.040
Oh, they have to exist, right?

57:58.160 --> 57:59.440
On their fixie tricycles?

57:59.440 --> 58:00.720
Like, yeah.

58:04.080 --> 58:05.520
It's a fixie big wheel.

58:05.520 --> 58:06.240
Don't worry about it.

58:08.320 --> 58:10.000
Are these free range animal crackers?

58:10.800 --> 58:11.600
Gotta know.

58:11.600 --> 58:12.400
If these have been caged-

58:12.400 --> 58:14.240
I'm ironically eating animals.

58:16.400 --> 58:17.040
How droll.

58:17.040 --> 58:19.840
I don't even like Dunk Roos.

58:19.840 --> 58:21.120
I don't even like Dunk Roos.

58:21.120 --> 58:22.080
Oh, look at me.

58:22.080 --> 58:23.200
I'm part of the proletariat.

58:27.440 --> 58:28.480
So delicious, get it?

58:29.680 --> 58:30.880
Where's my Clif Bar?

58:33.360 --> 58:36.000
Oh man, I really am so disconnected from-

58:37.040 --> 58:40.080
We gotta have some- we gotta have some fucking kids, you guys.

58:40.640 --> 58:44.960
Do ki- somebody just like us- one of us needs to have kids like a scout.

58:44.960 --> 58:45.200
Yeah.

58:45.200 --> 58:46.560
Just so we know what's going on.

58:46.560 --> 58:50.000
So we can- like, we got our fingers in pretty much every demographic,

58:51.600 --> 58:53.600
but we don't have our fingers in any kids.

58:56.560 --> 58:57.680
Get ready for kindergarten.

58:58.320 --> 59:00.560
Don't let adults put their fingers in you.

59:00.560 --> 59:01.200
That's bad.

59:01.200 --> 59:02.080
That's not how it works.

59:02.080 --> 59:02.800
That's bad.

59:02.800 --> 59:04.560
It's a bad, bad look.

59:04.560 --> 59:08.240
I think that my problem in trying to answer this question is that I picture

59:08.880 --> 59:11.600
kids as just like tiny adults.

59:11.600 --> 59:14.240
Like, that they're into the exact same stuff that adults are into.

59:14.240 --> 59:15.840
That's why we're not parents.

59:15.840 --> 59:18.320
Because we're all- we all operate under that illusion.

59:18.320 --> 59:20.240
Like, if we ever had kids, we'd be like,

59:20.240 --> 59:22.000
hey, there's a new Grindhouse movie coming out.

59:22.000 --> 59:22.800
Oh, you're three.

59:23.440 --> 59:24.640
Ah, shit.

59:25.200 --> 59:27.040
Oh, you've got to try this seasonal ale.

59:27.040 --> 59:28.320
Ah, you're three.

59:28.320 --> 59:28.960
Ah, bummer.

59:28.960 --> 59:30.000
You can't do this.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.280
You want some more bacon?

59:31.280 --> 59:32.160
Ah, you're one.

59:32.160 --> 59:32.720
You're one.

59:32.720 --> 59:33.600
Don't have teeth yet.

59:33.600 --> 59:34.800
Can't nom this bacon yet.

59:35.840 --> 59:38.240
Oh man, that is so weird to think about.

59:38.240 --> 59:40.400
There are humans on this planet that can't eat bacon.

59:40.960 --> 59:43.280
Like, little people, just like you and I.

59:43.280 --> 59:46.960
Little people and also Jewish people also can't.

59:46.960 --> 59:47.920
I don't think that's true.

59:48.480 --> 59:49.200
It's not kosher.

59:49.200 --> 59:52.640
Pretty much, I think everyone other than Americans.

59:52.640 --> 59:52.880
Yeah.

59:52.880 --> 59:53.680
And Canadians.

59:55.120 --> 59:56.960
Canadians are eating thin ham, though.

59:56.960 --> 59:58.000
Don't let them fucking fool you.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.040
Yeah, that's fair.

59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.480
Nice try, Canada.

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:02.160
Canada, your music and comedy is great.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.360
Your bacon sucks.

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.240
Your bacon is fucking really bad.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:10.320
I had some smoked bacon yesterday at the Blind Pig in Louisville, Kentucky.

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:12.080
Boy, that was- boy, that was good.

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:13.520
I had bacon ice cream.

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.480
Try some bacon ice cream.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.720
I had big chunks of caramelized bacon in it.

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.080
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:19.680
We really got off topic there.

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:23.440
Yeah, that was a pretty- that was a pretty dramatic shift.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:23.920
But you know what?

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:24.720
Topic, Anton.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:28.160
When I was four going on five, nobody gave me any fucking pearls.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.280
Just tough it out, kid.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.640
That's how you get to be like us.

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:32.320
Tough it out, pussy.

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:33.600
My brother, my brother, me.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.080
There it is.

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.080
So this is My Brother, My Brother, Me.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:36.800
It's our show.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.240
Thank you for listening to it so much.

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:41.200
Thank you once again for joining us for this hour.

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:44.480
I need a podcast where three people, three grown adults, yell at kids.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:46.480
We got that for you.

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.040
Yeah, we got one of those right here.

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:54.640
We really appreciate everybody talking about our show on Twitter.

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:59.120
Of course, Austin and Mariko is there getting it- getting it done.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:04.480
DuckLips513, CocaineLols.

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:10.400
Oh, oh, oh, we also have to give like a huge thank you to Casey Green.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:23.200
You can find his stuff at CaseyGreen.com.com and he- he wore a MBMBAM t-shirt in the Boston Globe.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:24.640
On a piece about-

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:25.120
In a picture.

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:27.840
On a piece about webcomic writers living in Boston.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:32.160
And I want to take a moment to thank- we have- I don't know that we've ever thanked the webcomic

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.760
community, but holy shit.

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:37.840
They come out in swarms to talk about-

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:38.160
Yeah.

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.200
We're talking about- we're talking about big-name players like Emily Terrible.

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:42.640
Talking about-

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:43.040
I love her.

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.040
Talking about boxer, hockey, Darwin.

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:48.960
Talking about all- all the good- all the good comics.

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:50.000
So thank you guys so much.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.280
If you ever want to make comics of us, let us know.

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:53.840
We'll pose.

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:54.960
We'll pose-

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:55.440
Pose for you.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:56.080
Pose for them.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.440
Pose- pose nude.

01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.080
Yeah.

01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:58.240
Yeah.

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:00.000
We want to make naked comics.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:00.400
Sell them.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:01.360
We'll be super nude.

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:02.320
How nude do you want it?

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.400
It's a sliding scale.

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:05.600
Pose as nude as you want.

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:09.840
You better give me Minotaur legs, though.

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:11.040
Minotaur legs are no deal.

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:13.760
mbnbam.com is our website.

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:16.480
At mbnbam is our Twitter.

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:17.920
Use the mbnbam hashtag.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:22.240
Congratulations to our buddy, Brett O'Floss, for crossing 10,000 followers.

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:31.680
Guys.

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:32.080
And uh-

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:32.880
What?

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:33.440
Holy shit.

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:35.920
What? Jesse Thorne had a baby.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:36.640
Jesse and Teresa.

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:37.920
Oh my god.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.360
Congratulations, you guys.

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:42.320
It is the most adorable human being I've ever seen.

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.640
Can't eat bacon quite yet.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:45.440
It'll get there, though.

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:46.880
Yep.

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:47.440
Simon Thorne.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:48.800
So welcome to the world, little guy.

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:49.600
Thank you-

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.960
Simon Travis Thorne.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:51.200
Yeah.

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.200
I can only assume.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.520
Simon mbnbam Thorne.

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:58.560
Welcome to the world, little buddy.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:02.240
Thank you to John Rogers Longwinners for our awesome theme song.

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.680
Go buy that record.

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.200
It's putting the days to bed.

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.480
It's the name of the record, the theme song.

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:08.000
It's putting days to bed.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:08.480
Just listen to it.

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:09.280
Name of the record.

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:10.480
Just go buy it and listen to it.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:12.480
Spotify it.

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:13.120
Is that a verb?

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.840
Yeah, you can Spotify things now.

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.360
Verbs are created instantly now.

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:18.240
You don't have to wait on those.

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:18.740
Okay.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.360
And that's everything.

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:22.400
Thank you guys so much.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.600
Make sure you come back next week and we'll do it again.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:29.200
If you wouldn't mind, just like tell someone that you care about.

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:30.240
Maybe burn them a CD.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:37.440
Maybe burn them a CD or put it on a floppy disk and put it in their a drive for floppies.

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.800
So that's where floppies go.

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:44.640
I have a Yahoo that I'd like to consider over the next week.

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:45.140
Okay.

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:46.180
All right.

01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:47.040
Something to grow on.

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:47.840
We'll answer next week.

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:48.640
Something to grow on.

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:49.600
Something to think about.

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.640
You're already, you skipped to the thinking.

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:57.600
This one was sent in by Louie Dog.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:58.640
Thank you Louie Dog.

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:01.280
It's by a Yahoo answers user, Tom12.

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.320
It's kind of a long one.

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:05.840
Who asks, can pregnant women go swimming?

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:09.520
Is it possible for pregnant women to go swimming without unintentionally drowning the baby?

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:13.040
How far, how can the baby breathe if the vagina is underwater?

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:16.320
Should the mother keep her vagina above the water so the baby can breathe through it?

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.120
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:21.920
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:22.960
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.200
This has been my brother and my brother and me.

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:25.920
It's your dad.

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:28.880
It's going to be right on the lips.
