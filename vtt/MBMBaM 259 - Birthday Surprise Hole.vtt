WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:45.360
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna? Just say, hey I wanna. Just say, hey I wanna.

00:45.360 --> 00:48.080
Hey everybody, welcome to My Brother and Me, an invite show for the modern era. I'm

00:48.080 --> 00:51.280
your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

00:52.480 --> 00:56.480
It's me, the sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. I am so sorry that I was late

00:56.480 --> 01:01.120
recording the podcast. Like 20 minutes late. 40 minutes combined between me and Travis.

01:01.120 --> 01:04.640
Yeah, wasted. That's 40 minutes of our life we won't get back. What could we have done with

01:04.640 --> 01:10.400
that 40 minutes? Knowing you, you were probably like watching old episodes of Sister Sister on

01:10.400 --> 01:14.800
Hulu or something. I'll have you know I was eating cold fried chicken over my kitchen sink like a

01:14.800 --> 01:24.000
monster. And I was watching old episodes of Sister Sister on HBO Go. I was taking a cold shower.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.840
Uh, that's my new thing. If you haven't tried it, I would highly recommend it. Very bracing,

01:29.840 --> 01:34.720
very good for the heart, the creativity. I do that as well. It's also very good for

01:34.720 --> 01:38.560
your skin and for your smell. When do you start that Trav? Uh, I started about uh,

01:38.560 --> 01:44.160
about eight months ago. Yeah, do you only take cold showers? Well what I do is I start off warm

01:44.720 --> 01:48.880
and then turn the temperature down. Ah, you do that James Bond shower. Do that James Bond

01:48.880 --> 01:52.720
shower. That's correct Griffin. Are you trying to get rid of some hard-ons? You two just got chronic

01:52.720 --> 02:00.880
hard-ons for China squash? I do, but it's not connected. It's actually, I think an old wives

02:00.880 --> 02:07.600
tale that taking the cold shower increases one's sexual potency. No, it can't and it won't. It

02:07.600 --> 02:13.680
gives you better boners because it freezes them in place. And it freezes the blood in there?

02:13.680 --> 02:20.080
It freezes the blood in your boner-sickle. This is the worst introduction we've ever done.

02:20.080 --> 02:24.960
Because we're just talking about frozen boners. This was your idea Griffin. You were curious

02:24.960 --> 02:29.360
about the cold shower lifestyle that Travis and I are living. And I'm here to tell you,

02:30.880 --> 02:35.280
almost every day you switch it to cold. I get in it like lukewarm and then I just go full cold

02:35.280 --> 02:40.800
shower the whole time. Uh, it feels, at first it feels like you're gonna die. I'm dying. But then

02:40.800 --> 02:46.960
it's like I'm alive. You come through a hole. You live in that pain. You just exist in it. And then

02:46.960 --> 02:53.600
you can't feel it anymore. Um, but how do the ghosts talk to you? Sorry, what? How do you,

02:53.600 --> 02:58.960
oh sorry, not talk, but how do the ghosts get messages to you? Oh, without the steamy mirror.

02:58.960 --> 03:02.720
I got you. The mirror gets steamy from the hot shower and then the ghost is like,

03:02.720 --> 03:09.200
hey Griffin, have a good day. Love your grandpa. Love your, sorry, it's not denoting who it's from.

03:09.200 --> 03:12.480
Love your grandpa. It's like, by the way, we're out of salsa. Can you pick some up?

03:12.480 --> 03:18.080
Love your wife, Rachel. I want you to do two things for me today. I need you to run to HEB.

03:18.080 --> 03:22.080
I need you to get some salsa, preferably of the mild variety. And also go love your grandpa.

03:23.920 --> 03:32.240
Boo, it's me, your wife. I can't believe your wife was grandpa ghost catfishing you the whole time.

03:32.240 --> 03:39.600
You misunderstand. She just wants me to love my grandpa. Okay. And also to go get some salsa

03:39.600 --> 03:44.400
because we are plum out. Are you completely out or do you have like the dregs at the bottom,

03:44.400 --> 03:49.280
but nobody really wants the dregs because there's like one tomato chunk in there.

03:49.280 --> 03:52.400
No, it's not. I'm not worried about the tomato chunks. I'm worried about the

03:52.400 --> 03:58.560
Tostito residuals. There's one sad chip in there that's just been marooned from his flock.

03:58.560 --> 04:04.160
Here's the other thing about salsa. Yeah. But seriously, I do want to say one other thing

04:04.160 --> 04:12.000
about salsa. Don't you guys hate it when you see a jar of flavored salsa, like some sort of exotic

04:12.000 --> 04:17.600
salsa, like maybe a mango habanero salsa and you think, oh my God, that's going to be great.

04:17.600 --> 04:22.080
And you eat it and you're like, well, that was good. But now I've condemned myself to this salsa

04:22.720 --> 04:27.440
for, you just want, your buds want just like normal salsa. That's only a party salsa, Justin,

04:27.440 --> 04:31.680
because you're basically tasking your group of friends to take on the beast with you.

04:31.680 --> 04:38.640
Yeah. I don't want to go this alone. Yeah, sure. It's a Sunday, you just got out of church and

04:38.640 --> 04:43.600
you're just looking for a sensible dip. And all that you've got is a sweet salsa. And that's

04:44.160 --> 04:49.120
on Saturday night and it's party time. That's what you want. Let me hit you guys with this.

04:49.120 --> 04:52.960
As long as we're talking about salsa, one last sort of salsa avenue I want to take us down.

04:52.960 --> 04:58.960
Hop in your row boats through the lovely avenues of Salsa Venice, where the alleyways are just

04:58.960 --> 05:04.800
salsa, salsa Greeks. And we're going to go on this salsa trip together. How about this salsa idea

05:04.800 --> 05:10.480
that I've just come up with? Individual salsa packets, like ketchup packets, but it's just a

05:10.480 --> 05:14.160
little bit of salsa in there. And then you can have whatever kind of fun flavors you want in there.

05:14.960 --> 05:19.520
Are you talking like a little ramekin size or just like literally like a little pouch?

05:19.520 --> 05:24.480
A little pouch. I think they have those. They're at Taco Bell and you can take as many as you want.

05:24.480 --> 05:28.720
Oh, that's salsa in there, idiot? Well, I mean, it's more like taco sauce.

05:28.720 --> 05:30.960
Yeah, it's more like taco sauce. That's a totally different thing.

05:30.960 --> 05:34.400
I'm drinking a tall glass of salsa right here. I mean, it's actually more like water.

05:36.320 --> 05:38.880
You can't just call things salsa. You can't just call things other things.

05:40.560 --> 05:45.200
This is an original idea. You've made me so upset and we haven't even started the show.

05:45.200 --> 05:50.400
I used to think that the thing about, you always think fresh salsa, you're going to make it homemade,

05:50.400 --> 05:54.160
right? You're going to put it in the bullet. I have never thought this. I've never thought

05:54.160 --> 05:59.600
that once in my adult life. You're going to think it's going to be so good, get it homemade, and then you just make salsa at home.

05:59.600 --> 06:04.560
It just tastes like garbage. It's like a slurry of shitty vegetables and like,

06:04.560 --> 06:08.240
oh, this is from my garden. Really? Because it tastes like trash. It's almost like there

06:08.960 --> 06:13.520
should be a professional version of it you could pay money for that somebody who knows better than

06:13.520 --> 06:20.160
you made. Yeah. I recreate other things in my home. Right. I have brought other things into my

06:20.160 --> 06:26.720
home that I've tasted in the outside world that I've enjoyed. Today I tried two, this is not a joke,

06:26.720 --> 06:30.720
I tried two different preparations of candied bacon because I'm trying to find the one that works

06:30.720 --> 06:36.080
best for me and my family. I am here to tell you the results are private.

06:39.040 --> 06:42.960
Well, you're still trying to get funding. You don't want to release the results too quickly,

06:42.960 --> 06:46.080
or else no one's going to pay. Hey guys, as we're talking about salsa, did I ever tell you about

06:46.080 --> 06:56.400
the time that I was in my high school TV news class? I say news, but it was really just fun

06:56.400 --> 07:03.280
vids for kids. I tried to make a cooking show using the condiment station at Huntington High

07:03.280 --> 07:09.520
School. There's one episode where I did try to make salsa using packets of hot sauce and

07:09.520 --> 07:16.720
banana peppers and tomatoes and lettuce. I didn't have a whole lot going on. I didn't have a lot

07:16.720 --> 07:25.680
to work with. Can I tell you that I failed and what I created is unspeakable. Now you have IBS.

07:25.680 --> 07:32.000
When I was in my TV production class in high school, I was not well liked at all. Everyone

07:32.000 --> 07:37.280
thought nobody liked me in my TV production class, which was not a rarity in high school,

07:37.280 --> 07:40.560
but it was really pronounced in the TV production class, which is somewhere I thought I would fit

07:40.560 --> 07:49.440
in pretty well. The whole class was run by just jackbooted hillbilly thugs. One day I looked in

07:49.440 --> 07:55.280
the TV monitor and I saw that they had trained a camera on me and written at the bottom of the TV

07:55.280 --> 08:01.440
monitor, Justin is a homosexual. I was upset not to be called a homosexual. That's fine. That's

08:01.440 --> 08:08.400
their prerogative. At the bottom, I didn't know how to make words come up on the screen. I didn't

08:08.400 --> 08:15.120
even know that was something we could do in class. I was upset about that because I thought that my

08:15.120 --> 08:18.880
superiority intellectually would carry me, but I didn't even have that to hold over them anymore

08:18.880 --> 08:24.160
because they had all these advanced video toaster techniques that I was not privy to.

08:24.160 --> 08:35.200
Do they actually use those words or was it more colorful? That's the weird thing about it. If one

08:35.200 --> 08:44.320
was making a nature documentary. On the sexuality spectrum, Justin lands closer to the homosexual

08:44.320 --> 08:47.760
side of things. Observe him in his natural habitat, which is getting bullied in high school.

08:49.680 --> 08:52.880
Do you guys just want to wrap this whole time? We've gone like nine minutes now without doing

08:52.880 --> 08:56.880
a classroom. Yeah, let's keep going. What did that remind you guys of? High school?

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
I did a hard-hitting expose in my high school TV media class about why the third lunch period

09:04.000 --> 09:10.800
always ran out of turkey clubs. When I was doing it, I fucking felt like I was cracking this case

09:10.800 --> 09:16.320
wide open. Then the lunch lady informed me that it was because they were very popular,

09:16.320 --> 09:21.840
so everybody ate them during the first two lunch periods. After that, she always held a turkey

09:21.840 --> 09:27.840
club for me that I could eat. She would hide it under the table and then give it to me during

09:27.840 --> 09:33.680
third lunch period. I appreciate that. Thank you very much. I did a hard-hitting expose. One day,

09:33.680 --> 09:37.600
we all got pedometers in high school and then whoever racked up the highest count over the

09:37.600 --> 09:42.240
course of a week got a bike. There were some kids that would just sit in class and shake their

09:42.240 --> 09:46.480
pedometers to get that number going. I did a hard-hitting expose on pedometer shaking,

09:46.480 --> 09:54.000
but it did devolve into just a bunch of jerk-off gags, like a bunch of jerk-off gags.

09:54.560 --> 10:02.160
One day, when I was in media production in middle school, we had a weekly news program for all of

10:02.160 --> 10:07.360
Comac. I think it was WCMS was the name of the show because it was Comac Middle School and it

10:07.360 --> 10:18.720
was the show. I used to do top 10 lists as a comedy segment on WCMS. I don't know if you guys

10:18.720 --> 10:26.320
have heard about these top 10 lists, but they were ahead of the curve. Maybe I wasn't targeting my

10:26.320 --> 10:36.560
audience very well. Maybe it was a little too adult, too grown up. I was fired from doing top

10:36.560 --> 10:41.920
10 lists because they told me that they didn't want to do them anymore. The next week, I'm

10:41.920 --> 10:51.840
sitting in class watching WCMS and what do I see? John Fraley on the screen doing a top 10 list,

10:51.840 --> 10:58.720
stealing my bit I stole from David Letterman and just doing it like, here are some. They were like,

10:58.720 --> 11:02.240
it was all fart gags. There was no nuance, nothing.

11:02.240 --> 11:06.880
Now, Griffin, did you get to do KidsMag or was that just Justin and I?

11:07.440 --> 11:10.480
No, I didn't get to do it. I was not invited on the air. I think they knew that

11:12.000 --> 11:13.680
my material was a little bit too raw.

11:14.320 --> 11:20.080
KidsMag was a local kids news program that was shown, I think, Saturday mornings,

11:20.080 --> 11:26.320
Sunday mornings on WWK. It's great because I'm really glad that there's filmed evidence of what

11:26.320 --> 11:33.840
giant, giant. Holy shit, what a dingus you are. Oh God, man. A Minkus, I would say. I was a solid

11:33.840 --> 11:41.040
Minkus. You were Minkus Khan. They had to pay Travis for his life rights to Minkus.

11:41.680 --> 11:45.760
They didn't want a lawsuit on their hands, so they actually paid him a nominal fee to be able

11:45.760 --> 11:49.600
to use the character Minkus in Boy Meets World. I just picture Mom and Dad looking at me while

11:49.600 --> 11:54.480
I was watching Boy Meets World and they were like, he's pretty close, but we could get closer.

11:54.480 --> 11:59.120
And then they took a picture of Minkus and said, give us these glasses and this haircut

11:59.120 --> 12:03.280
and whatever shirts you can find that kind of look like this, and then put them on the air.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.040
Let's do our thing.

12:07.040 --> 12:09.200
No, absolutely not. I refuse.

12:09.200 --> 12:14.240
I spent like a half hour looking up Yahoo's, by which I mean going through our Gmail and

12:14.240 --> 12:18.960
picking my favorite Yahoo's. And I don't want that work to be for naught. I already had 20 minutes

12:18.960 --> 12:23.440
wasted for me today. Use them next week. They'll keep. I feel like people are gonna get angry if

12:23.440 --> 12:30.960
we don't do advice. I'm showing, not telling. I'm showing through my life experience how to live.

12:31.920 --> 12:36.720
Okay, so what have we said so far that's been actionable? Take cold showers,

12:37.280 --> 12:45.120
individually wrapped salsa packets. But do be a Minkus, Travis, because you were a happy kid.

12:45.120 --> 12:50.800
You know my one regret, Griffin? I didn't embrace it. I was a very smart kid. I was

12:50.800 --> 12:56.400
in the advanced programs, but I wanted to be cool. And I was so worried about that,

12:56.400 --> 13:03.920
that I didn't just like go on to be a very rich doctor or a lawyer or engineer or scientist.

13:03.920 --> 13:07.200
Isn't it funny how like, I don't think I was a smart kid. I think I was really,

13:07.200 --> 13:12.240
really good at taking tests. And like, whenever I talk about like now that I'm an adult,

13:12.240 --> 13:16.320
and I talk about being in the tag classes and the talented and gifted classes, and I brag,

13:16.320 --> 13:22.480
I'm bragging. But really, I know in my heart of hearts that I just really was psyched to like

13:22.480 --> 13:29.520
twice a week play Island of the Zoombinis. Yeah. Do a math blaster? Do some math blaster. And I

13:29.520 --> 13:33.280
did great at math blaster. Again, I do not think I was especially smart. I think I was just like

13:33.280 --> 13:39.520
dope at video games. And I didn't, I refused. I was, I was defiant against learning anything

13:39.520 --> 13:42.800
from the Island of the Zoombinis. They were trying to teach me problem solving skills,

13:42.800 --> 13:47.520
trying to teach me logic, reasoning, morals. And I said, thank you Zoombinis for the lessons,

13:47.520 --> 13:51.280
but I will ignore those. I'm just trying to get a high score because I'm a number one, 100% gamer.

13:51.280 --> 13:57.600
I remember we built a toothpick bridges. We did some Coke can like balancing scale.

13:57.600 --> 14:01.920
I built a toothpick version of Jeff Bridges and he was my boyfriend for a while.

14:03.600 --> 14:09.040
Here's the thing. When I described the tag class to people, people often don't believe me that I

14:09.040 --> 14:13.600
got into it because of how especially smart I was because when I described, well, we would lay in

14:13.600 --> 14:19.520
like a pillow thing and read. And the kids hear it. Yeah. And then we would, we would play math

14:19.520 --> 14:25.200
blaster and people were like, and this was for especially smart kids. I think the more I think

14:25.200 --> 14:29.760
about tag, the tag classes we're in, did we explain that means talented and gifted? Yeah.

14:29.760 --> 14:35.120
Tag. That's what that stands for. Not smart, not smart. Listen to the words. Not smart,

14:35.120 --> 14:41.360
talented and gifted euphemism and euphemism. I think, I think really that where I think about

14:41.360 --> 14:46.880
it, it was more of like a, a wedgie quarantine. Like these kids, these kids are not going to

14:46.880 --> 14:51.760
survive. They are not going to live to middle school and we can't lose another one. We have to

14:51.760 --> 14:56.400
cordon them off to keep them from the rest of the kids just so they are not nuclear wedgie.

14:56.400 --> 15:01.200
Yeah. I was going to talented and gifted classes. It was like Tuesday and Thursday. And on Wednesday,

15:01.200 --> 15:07.680
I was going to speech therapy. So really just like I was leaving class three out of five days

15:07.680 --> 15:12.400
of the week to go be weird. Who's that kid? I don't know. He comes around sometimes. I think

15:12.400 --> 15:17.280
he's a ghost. I think he's a minkus. Should we bully him? Let's get to it tomorrow. Oops.

15:17.280 --> 15:24.320
There's your mistake. You gotta catch him on Monday and Friday. I gotta set it. Promise me

15:24.320 --> 15:28.560
you'll remember this time guys. You have to remember this time we'll bully. I would, I would,

15:28.560 --> 15:33.840
they would try to bully me and I'd be like, hold please sirs before you try to bully me a riddle.

15:33.840 --> 15:39.680
You have one sheep, one sack of grain and one wolf and only two rafts to get them. Oh, oh,

15:39.680 --> 15:44.400
nope. You're bullying me. It's happening. I'm being bullied right now. Didn't even want to take a

15:44.400 --> 15:48.240
crack at it, huh? But then by fifth grade we were all on safety patrol and that's where you

15:48.240 --> 15:54.400
wield the true power. Right. Everybody respects that. A safety gun.

15:54.400 --> 16:01.440
It's just for looks. I got fired. I got fired from safety patrol. Did you? I was a loose cannon.

16:01.440 --> 16:08.080
What did you do? I got too many temerits. I mouthed off the teachers. What the, what? Yeah. No you

16:08.080 --> 16:14.800
didn't. I did. I was late to like a shit. It was like my third temerit and I was late to get out

16:14.800 --> 16:19.040
to the corner and the teacher was like, you were late. And I was like, I don't think I was. And that

16:19.040 --> 16:24.960
was my third temerit. And I got kicked off. I had to turn in my badge and sash. I really liked the

16:24.960 --> 16:28.960
flag part of safety patrol. That's where you help people cross the street. Did every school have

16:28.960 --> 16:33.440
safety patrol and fire patrol? I don't know. I don't know if they did or not. I'm just going

16:33.440 --> 16:37.920
to assume that they did. And I had a big flag that I would use to help kids cross the street,

16:37.920 --> 16:44.640
but really it was a bo staff like Donatello had in the teenage turtles. And I would, I would

16:44.640 --> 16:49.280
flail it around and do all kinds of stick and stick like stunts with it. And I realized now as

16:49.280 --> 16:54.960
a 28 year old man that maybe I just wanted to be in flag core, but I also wanted a badge and they

16:54.960 --> 16:59.360
don't give you those in flag core. I know there's no badges. I also think that now most of that

16:59.360 --> 17:03.760
safety stuff is done by adults because somebody realized that what they were doing was putting

17:03.760 --> 17:10.400
the lives of children into the hands of children and then sending the children with sashes to stand

17:10.400 --> 17:15.600
in the middle of the street. Yeah. Yeah. Can you imagine like the, like their children,

17:15.600 --> 17:20.880
like they're still chill that you're giving the children, the power to stop cars. Like,

17:20.880 --> 17:27.440
what are you doing? All right. Stephen, you got this, right? Like you can barely tie your shoes,

17:27.440 --> 17:33.680
but you can like decide when is it safe, right? Okay. Have fun. I remembered the one time that

17:33.680 --> 17:41.280
this girl walked around my flag. What? She didn't respect, she didn't respect the staff

17:41.280 --> 17:46.720
or the badge. She just walked around and I tried to stop her and I couldn't. And that's when I

17:46.720 --> 17:52.320
realized that authority is meaningless. It's all an illusion, Justin. It's all an illusion. You can

17:52.320 --> 17:55.920
build your own bridges. You know, she taught me a powerful lesson that day. Your own Jeff Bridges

17:55.920 --> 18:02.000
to be your boyfriend. So you guys are on safety patrol and fire patrol. Do you guys remember in

18:02.000 --> 18:07.360
safety patrol there being a rush on the really good flag staff? Oh yeah. I remember we had some

18:07.360 --> 18:12.000
that were like kind of crummy and threadbare. They were like frayed on the end too. Yeah. Yeah. And

18:12.000 --> 18:15.200
I was always afraid to get those cause I thought I'd break it accidentally. And that's a big

18:15.200 --> 18:20.640
demerit there. Was it bamboo? It was bamboo. Yeah. It was like bamboo staffs that they attach flags

18:20.640 --> 18:26.080
to. With a blade on the end, a crude bronze blade. I will, I will also say, I want to say it was

18:26.080 --> 18:32.880
Ms. Wilson was the head teacher of safety patrol. To her credit, even though I was kicked off of

18:32.880 --> 18:39.760
safety patrol, I was still allowed to attend the yearly event at Camden park celebrating all the

18:39.760 --> 18:46.960
safety patrol. I was just shows up, but beard all grizzled, fucking Hawaiian shirt, half unbuttoned,

18:46.960 --> 18:52.880
like a ring of cocaine still around. Hey, you guys still patrolling? You know, I still got it.

18:52.880 --> 18:57.680
I could patrol right now. No problem. Down at Camden park and all the other safety patrol

18:57.680 --> 19:02.080
kids were rounded up and I was left as like the rogue guy. Cause they were like, he's not

19:02.080 --> 19:06.960
in safety patrol. He didn't even have a sash, but I still had all the wherewithal. Yeah. I fucking,

19:06.960 --> 19:11.360
I saved all of them. Swimming through the log flume, like popping up, slitting a dude's throat.

19:12.800 --> 19:17.040
Or safely escorting him through traffic. Yeah. That's another thing. One of those two things.

19:17.040 --> 19:21.680
Their whole plan hinged on running through traffic and the, luckily there was one man

19:21.680 --> 19:28.640
there able to stop him. I was captain of the fire patrol one year. Got. Whoa. Yeah. I got a lot of

19:28.640 --> 19:39.280
puts. I was talking about, uh, uh, getting fired from the patrol and, uh, it reminded me of one of

19:39.280 --> 19:44.560
the two times I've ever been fired at a job. One of course was cause I stole a copy of fight club

19:44.560 --> 19:50.080
and got fired from blockbuster. Among other things, among other things, show girls, the VHS tape.

19:50.080 --> 19:54.320
No, it didn't. I had Tommy read, uh, while we were on vacation, he taped that off at HBO for me. I

19:54.320 --> 19:57.360
didn't need to get that. You had that. God, this is the second time that we've had to do this

19:57.360 --> 20:03.360
intervention on the show before it had a blockbuster video box. I found your stash. I got a better,

20:03.360 --> 20:09.760
I got a better copy later, but that was like, I didn't need it. Um, so I got fired from,

20:09.760 --> 20:14.480
did you guys know I got fired at the pub? I used to be, I, you know how I'm always telling jokes

20:14.480 --> 20:22.720
and doing like jicanery and stuff. Well, well, uh, that job, that, that proclivity for entertainment

20:22.720 --> 20:30.160
got, um, it got me a job at the pub, uh, and family fun center as a weekly, uh, weeknight DJ

20:30.160 --> 20:34.160
on Fridays and Saturday nights. I'd be the one up there spinning CDs and playing everybody's hits

20:34.160 --> 20:40.880
from the fifties, sixties, seventies, and today. Um, and I, uh, they constantly wanted me to add

20:40.880 --> 20:45.200
new stunts, new like tricks and stunts to my repertoire while people were trying to eat some

20:45.200 --> 20:52.640
fucking pizza. Yeah. Devil, devil sticks. Yeah. Yeah. The guy named Chad that I replaced,

20:52.640 --> 20:58.560
he later came back. He got a job at circusy. He like was so, he, he had like a way with it. I

20:58.560 --> 21:03.760
don't know how he was able to do it, but I think he turned it up really loud and sometimes he would

21:03.760 --> 21:12.640
light some, um, he would light the table on fire. That was like a cool trick. I got demoted from

21:12.640 --> 21:18.000
that position. They like called me in. They're like, would you consider doing some extra stunts?

21:18.000 --> 21:24.080
Like maybe trying to get people to do the YMCA or maybe bring in a suit and do a blues brothers

21:25.120 --> 21:29.360
performance with somebody else. And I said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not, not, not, not, not,

21:29.360 --> 21:35.520
not. What a crazy thing to ask. What a, what a crazy thing that you were working in the arcade.

21:35.520 --> 21:41.920
You were like ticket exchange. No, I got demoted to that, to that. You were, you were front room.

21:41.920 --> 21:47.040
You were at the big show. I was in the big show. And then I had to watch the big show while I

21:47.040 --> 21:53.040
fucking unjammed a token out of the, the, uh, sunset writers machine. Sure. They moved you

21:53.760 --> 21:58.640
from the place where you did not belong to the place where you absolutely belonged.

21:58.640 --> 22:02.880
Because maybe I just love that job for you because one time me and Alex White rolled up,

22:02.880 --> 22:07.440
we're like, Hey, we're going to beat this Sega underwater shooter game. And it would,

22:07.440 --> 22:11.040
otherwise it would cost you $130 in quarters to do that. And you're like, let me show you

22:11.040 --> 22:14.560
a special switch. And you show a special switch when you played it all day long. It was the best

22:14.560 --> 22:21.920
day of my life. So still dirty that day. No, still, still. Sorry, Rachel. Um, yeah,

22:21.920 --> 22:26.800
I liked working back in the arcade. That was a good gig. Did you ever steal shit? What?

22:26.800 --> 22:31.840
Did you ever steal shit? What am I going to steal? I'm going to jeopardize my job so I can

22:31.840 --> 22:36.720
take home 30 wacky wall gummy crawlers. Like really one of those pencil toppers. Let me say

22:36.720 --> 22:43.120
this. You work at an establishment, uh, where you sell things that you like and you steal from it.

22:43.120 --> 22:46.320
And it's great because now you have the things that you like, right? The, the arcade, there's

22:46.320 --> 22:52.480
not a lot of stuff that you like there. Unless you steal like a, like a, an arcade game. Well,

22:52.480 --> 22:56.160
yes. If you can see, if you can get the sunset writers into your car, then it was never the pubs

22:56.160 --> 23:02.080
to begin with. It was just waiting for you. Right. Um, but what I'm saying is it's less about what

23:02.080 --> 23:07.600
you like and more about like sort of the, you steal the fog machine, right? You steal the disco

23:07.600 --> 23:15.200
ball. That's 30,000 tickets. That's so like the, the, the fiscal sense that that makes, right? Like

23:15.200 --> 23:19.360
you know, you're stealing a 30,000 ticket item. I'm not saying you steal a bunch of tootsie rolls

23:19.360 --> 23:24.880
for five tickets a pop. I'm saying you steal the bike for 200,000 tickets. Right. And you know that

23:24.880 --> 23:29.360
like there's no way anybody would ever get that thing. And so like the, I don't know. I would

23:29.360 --> 23:33.040
think I would find that just deeply, deeply rewarding, but that stuff was always there.

23:33.040 --> 23:38.000
That's like, that's like why I couldn't steal the bike. The bike was like part of the decoration.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.760
I think it had a fucking chips logo on it. Like if you move the bike, the paint underneath was

23:43.760 --> 23:50.400
a different color. Absolutely. Like you couldn't take the bike. Everybody would notice that.

23:50.400 --> 23:55.120
Did you work at Tilt too? Or am I dreaming now? Nah, nah, nah. I didn't work at Tilt. I applied to Tilt but

23:55.120 --> 24:00.480
didn't make that. But you know what? Considering sort of financially what became of Arcade specifically

24:00.480 --> 24:06.000
Tilt, which is now a Primitives store at the mall. That was probably- Did you know I live around the

24:06.000 --> 24:09.760
corner from a Primitives? I could spit on a Primitives. I could open up my window right

24:09.760 --> 24:13.440
now and spit on a Primitives. I wouldn't think Austin would be like a hotspot for Primitives.

24:13.440 --> 24:19.200
Wait, what is Primitives? They sell a lot of things made of cow hide. For us, it's like,

24:19.200 --> 24:24.240
I don't know, sort of a fake pioneer. Like if all the pioneers had like unlimited- Oh,

24:24.240 --> 24:29.280
interesting. So a bunch of like corn husk dolls and- That kind of thing. Maybe some whisk brooms.

24:29.280 --> 24:35.280
See for our Primitives, it sells just a lot of things made out of cow hide. A lot of reclaimed

24:35.280 --> 24:42.080
wood. A lot of like things that you would see in a wealthier person that maybe lives up in the

24:42.080 --> 24:46.400
hills but they still want to like keep it real so they have like a few wooden Native Americans.

24:46.400 --> 24:50.960
Oh, see. So like here in Los Angeles, it would be like old film reels and like really vintage

24:50.960 --> 24:57.840
cocaine. Yeah, exactly. That's hard too because it sticks together and you just get big rocks of it.

24:57.840 --> 25:01.760
I mean, yeah, at that point, it's more of a showpiece than a practical thing unless,

25:01.760 --> 25:04.960
you know, you get really late at night and all the other cocaine has run out and then you're like,

25:04.960 --> 25:11.040
well, and that's when you like crack open your canter of cocaine. You dig through your fridge

25:11.040 --> 25:14.560
and you're like, there's gotta be some cocaine here somewhere. And then you just cut away the

25:14.560 --> 25:18.560
moldy part of the cocaine and it's still good. It's still good, man. Still that booger sugar

25:18.560 --> 25:24.000
still gonna get you feeling so right. Get in the pool. Hey, get in the pool.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.680
Do you guys ever do cocaine? No.

25:27.520 --> 25:32.240
No. I don't think that's like a crazy question. Someone out there is doing cocaine.

25:32.240 --> 25:36.640
Yeah. Hey, hey, someone's gotta be doing it, right? We're talking about it. Someone's gotta

25:36.640 --> 25:40.880
be doing it. Somebody's gonna win. I remember in college fighting out their girlfriend of mine had

25:40.880 --> 25:47.680
done cocaine at her senior prom. Nice. It rapid, it like drastically changed my opinion of her

25:47.680 --> 25:53.520
like in a split second where I went, oh. And like the, I was 21 at the time and the thought

25:53.520 --> 25:58.880
that flashed in my head was, I think she's too hardcore for me because she had done cocaine once.

25:58.880 --> 26:07.200
I was a babe. I have been places, I have lived places where cocaine was enjoyed irresponsibly.

26:07.200 --> 26:15.280
Right. Basically every night. And one time me and my roommate took a Blockbuster DVD back

26:15.280 --> 26:21.360
for one of said enjoyers. Just doing them a quickie favor and we ran it to the Blockbuster

26:21.360 --> 26:24.880
and when the guy opened it up to make sure the disc was in there, a very small bag of cocaine

26:24.880 --> 26:29.920
fell out. Let me grab that. To my roommate's credit, to my roommate's credit, it was like a

26:29.920 --> 26:39.360
like a three card Monty dealer. Like that level of subtlety. He just like put his hand on the,

26:39.360 --> 26:43.760
put his hand like, no late fees. But like when he sat down there was some cocaine underneath it.

26:45.760 --> 26:48.960
My friends Nick and Rusty, who were the guys hanging out in college,

26:49.760 --> 26:54.960
they took me under their wing and they did a lot of cocaine. Maybe not cocaine,

26:54.960 --> 26:59.760
but definitely a lot of weed. I remember very clearly. Well those two aren't analogous at all.

26:59.760 --> 27:04.720
No, I know. But I needed a way into talking about Nick and Rusty because the fun thing about hanging

27:04.720 --> 27:08.480
out those cats is I literally hang out with them every single day. It was like the first place I

27:08.480 --> 27:12.800
hung out that wasn't my parents. You know what I mean? Like I would be there constantly after school

27:12.800 --> 27:20.720
and they smoked weed every single day and I never did. But it was a very weird position to be in

27:20.720 --> 27:27.600
because every day was the same routine of like, well let's go rent Jekyll and Hyde together again

27:27.600 --> 27:32.800
from Blockbuster and get some of those pepperoni pan pizzas from the Super America. And I would

27:32.800 --> 27:38.240
like, this is a good day for you guys? Like you're enjoying, you're having a fun day today? I was

27:38.240 --> 27:47.600
more of like a weed mascot, I think. But then I began to question like, am I maybe, I'm not high,

27:47.600 --> 27:54.080
but they do have me around every time. And every time they also eat pepperoni pizza from the Super

27:54.080 --> 28:00.560
America and also rent Jekyll and Hyde together again. So maybe am I part of the essential weed?

28:00.560 --> 28:02.800
Like am I the Doritos of people?

28:02.800 --> 28:05.520
You're the Doritos of dudes.

28:05.520 --> 28:09.520
I mean, that's the only way they can, maybe they only liked me when they were high? I don't know

28:09.520 --> 28:10.080
exactly what role I was playing there.

28:10.080 --> 28:13.680
No, no, no, no, Justin. Everybody likes pepperoni pizza all the time.

28:13.680 --> 28:14.320
Right, sure.

28:14.320 --> 28:16.080
You just like it more when you're high.

28:16.720 --> 28:18.720
It heightened the experience of hanging out with me.

28:18.720 --> 28:22.240
You could really get every sense of the Justin McElroy when you're high.

28:22.240 --> 28:30.720
We actually, oh, I actually helped to fund a drug dealing operation. They wanted to get

28:30.720 --> 28:34.960
into selling weed. This was at Rusty, it was a friend of his whose name escapes me,

28:34.960 --> 28:36.640
but he wanted to get into selling weed.

28:36.640 --> 28:37.600
Hooba Stank, his name is Hooba Stank.

28:37.600 --> 28:39.680
His name was Hooba Stank.

28:39.680 --> 28:43.040
Hooba J Stank.

28:43.040 --> 28:49.360
I gave him some money on the promise that my investment of money would be returned to me

28:49.360 --> 28:54.240
because he would purchase weed and then sell it to me and then give me back more money

28:54.240 --> 28:55.280
than I had given him.

28:55.280 --> 29:02.400
Are you just now realizing the repercussions for your actions, Heisenberg?

29:02.400 --> 29:05.040
We're way past the, what's it called?

29:05.040 --> 29:06.480
Statute of Limitations.

29:06.480 --> 29:09.760
Statute of Limitations on this. And I'm joking, it's a podcast.

29:12.480 --> 29:13.440
But the-

29:13.440 --> 29:15.760
Dude, you get the money back. Don't leave me on pins and needles.

29:15.760 --> 29:19.360
What? Yeah, I made like $10, so worth it.

29:19.360 --> 29:22.480
So what you're saying is selling drugs, good way to go.

29:22.480 --> 29:25.760
Pays off. Well, no, not selling drugs. I never saw the product.

29:25.760 --> 29:30.320
Just being a venture capitalist in the drug world.

29:30.320 --> 29:30.640
Yes.

29:30.640 --> 29:36.960
You weren't Heisenberg, you were Gus Fring. You were in charge of the whole thing.

29:38.080 --> 29:42.720
And at the top of the ladder, Justin Kingpin McElroy.

29:42.720 --> 29:47.680
Yeah, can I ask what your name, your cool drug guy name was?

29:47.680 --> 29:51.200
I didn't have a drug guy name, but we did have a name for our corporation.

29:51.200 --> 29:52.800
It was called Balls Out United.

29:52.800 --> 29:53.760
Come on.

29:53.760 --> 29:55.040
I was in college, what do you want from me?

29:55.040 --> 29:58.720
So you really were in business with Hubert J. Stankington.

30:01.360 --> 30:04.560
It was easy money. Here's what I will say about selling drugs.

30:04.560 --> 30:08.400
No, here's what I will say about funding drug sales. It's easy money.

30:08.400 --> 30:12.480
10 of them. It's easy 10 money units.

30:12.480 --> 30:15.920
You know, people say like every time you buy drugs, you're also helping to fund terrorism

30:15.920 --> 30:16.720
because of their whole thing.

30:16.720 --> 30:23.200
But keep in mind that by buying drugs, you might just be helping me to buy that one last

30:24.080 --> 30:28.160
Marvel Legends action figure I needed to complete the robot

30:28.160 --> 30:30.640
that had like one piece of his body in each package.

30:31.680 --> 30:32.400
Remember that?

30:32.400 --> 30:36.880
Yeah, I do. I'm sorry. I'm just like, I guess I'm like disappointed in you.

30:37.840 --> 30:39.520
Well, I mean, I'm kind of disappointed too because I can

30:39.520 --> 30:44.800
retrospect that's pretty heavy, but at the time it seemed like a very accessible way.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.000
Can I ask how much you put in?

30:47.600 --> 30:51.280
Yeah, like $75, I think.

30:53.120 --> 30:54.560
It was not a major investment.

30:54.560 --> 30:58.480
Were you, wait, were you the sole investor or did you have like a 10% stake?

30:58.480 --> 31:00.560
Yeah, I was the money man.

31:00.560 --> 31:08.800
Okay, let me put it this way. If you're trying to bust this guy and your plan was follow the money.

31:08.800 --> 31:14.080
But this is just in quarters. Does he work at an arcade? What the fuck?

31:14.080 --> 31:18.000
Yeah. Why are there pub pizza family fund center tokens in here?

31:18.640 --> 31:20.480
If you follow the money, it would have led to me.

31:20.480 --> 31:22.880
You would have thought that I was the kingpin of this organization.

31:22.880 --> 31:28.560
It would have been just like two Polaroids on a cork board with just like one line between us.

31:28.560 --> 31:36.400
Justin, can I say how much money I would pay for a just interrogation video of 19 year old Justin

31:36.400 --> 31:41.440
McElroy with like two cops with like a bright light shining in his face. It's all I want.

31:41.440 --> 31:42.880
With his frosted tips.

31:46.400 --> 31:49.920
Sorry, I've been waiting for an opportunity to talk to you about your frosted tips.

31:49.920 --> 31:53.920
They would have dropped a bag of weed on the table and said,

31:53.920 --> 31:56.640
so does this look familiar? And I could look dead in the eye and say,

31:56.640 --> 32:00.640
I do not know what that is. And then they said,

32:00.640 --> 32:04.800
this is $75 worth of weed because it's 1936.

32:06.240 --> 32:13.360
What if they could have literally put like construction paper leaves of marijuana

32:13.360 --> 32:17.840
in a pile on the table and they would said, does this look familiar? And I would have

32:17.840 --> 32:21.040
not literally not known if they were messing with me or not.

32:21.040 --> 32:24.960
Is this what weed is? I have no idea. I'm just the money man.

32:24.960 --> 32:36.080
Speaking of money.

32:36.080 --> 32:38.400
We deserve money for not doing advice.

32:38.400 --> 32:42.800
Yep. Yeah. Oh, absolutely. We get, we get our money no matter what.

32:44.080 --> 32:45.920
We need to buy and sell weed.

32:46.560 --> 32:50.720
Yeah. My brother, my brother, me is supported in part by harrys.com,

32:50.720 --> 32:55.120
which offers high quality shave better for your face and better for your wallet.

32:55.120 --> 32:58.560
I'm a huge fan of Harry's products that make great razors.

32:58.560 --> 33:03.440
I love their aftershave. They have an aftershave lotion that I adore.

33:03.440 --> 33:06.320
I love their beforeshave. The pre-shave.

33:06.320 --> 33:08.960
I love the during shave lotion that you're doing with your left hand

33:08.960 --> 33:10.880
while you're shaving with your right. Yeah.

33:10.880 --> 33:15.200
It's next level shave maneuvers. You don't want to do this if it's your first time shaving.

33:15.200 --> 33:17.440
It's like you're patching, it's like you're patching drywall.

33:17.440 --> 33:18.720
Yeah. The wall is your face.

33:18.720 --> 33:21.840
I like the intra-shave lotion, which is between two shaves.

33:21.840 --> 33:24.720
When you think I really should shave, you just need to calm down a little bit

33:24.720 --> 33:26.320
and not shave. That's a great lotion.

33:26.320 --> 33:28.080
I like the anti-shave lotion.

33:28.080 --> 33:31.120
And you put it on your face and it's like the Santa Claus movie.

33:31.120 --> 33:32.320
Hair just grows right back.

33:32.320 --> 33:36.480
Speaking of, hey listeners who join me on Periscope, thank you so much.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.800
I'm just going to go ahead and cover this one outright.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.960
People will keep asking, how did I grow my beard?

33:41.600 --> 33:42.480
Just didn't shave it.

33:43.360 --> 33:44.080
Don't shave it.

33:44.080 --> 33:45.680
Just stop shaving.

33:45.680 --> 33:49.440
But you do want to shave and Harry's is going to help you do that with a $15 starter set

33:49.440 --> 33:52.960
that includes a razor foaming shave gel or shave cream

33:52.960 --> 33:56.560
and three razor blades plus free shipping.

33:56.560 --> 33:59.680
$15, that's a great deal, but we're going to make it even better.

33:59.680 --> 34:04.480
If you go to harrys.com and use the coupon code, my brother,

34:04.480 --> 34:08.960
use the code, my brother, all one word, you can save $5 off that starter set.

34:08.960 --> 34:12.960
And too often a lot of shave stuff is always marketed like directly towards men,

34:12.960 --> 34:13.760
which is a mistake.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.680
I think that Harry's is good for everybody.

34:15.680 --> 34:17.120
Anybody will like using Harry's.

34:17.120 --> 34:22.960
It's an excellent quality razor where you get really reasonably priced blades.

34:22.960 --> 34:23.840
Teresa uses it.

34:23.840 --> 34:24.400
She loves it.

34:25.360 --> 34:29.760
So that code again, my brother, go to harrys.com, use coupon code, my brother,

34:29.760 --> 34:32.720
and save $5 off of that starter set.

34:32.720 --> 34:34.080
Travis, who's our next sponsor?

34:34.080 --> 34:37.040
Oh, that would be a little company called Squarespace.

34:37.680 --> 34:39.360
Squarespace is a gigantic company.

34:39.360 --> 34:39.920
They're immediate.

34:39.920 --> 34:41.600
Griffin, I was doing, it was ironic.

34:41.600 --> 34:44.080
My brother, my brother and me is brought to you in part by Squarespace,

34:44.080 --> 34:45.840
the all-in-one website platform.

34:45.840 --> 34:48.320
At this point, is there anybody who like,

34:48.320 --> 34:51.200
what's the Venn diagram of people who listen to podcasts,

34:51.200 --> 34:53.040
but don't know what Squarespace is?

34:53.040 --> 34:56.720
I mean, there's only one website on the internet that doesn't use Squarespace,

34:56.720 --> 35:00.800
and it's the Space Jam website that's still in operation after all these years.

35:00.800 --> 35:02.400
Can you please just fucking talk about Squarespace?

35:02.400 --> 35:04.560
Yeah, Squarespace sites look professionally designed,

35:04.560 --> 35:07.600
regardless of your skill level, with no coding required.

35:07.600 --> 35:11.520
You can start your free trial site today with no credit card,

35:11.520 --> 35:13.200
at Squarespace.com.

35:13.200 --> 35:15.200
Use the offer code, MYBROTHER, all one word,

35:15.200 --> 35:17.760
and you'll get 10% off your first purchase.

35:17.760 --> 35:19.840
Squarespace, build it beautiful.

35:19.840 --> 35:22.080
You know, I used Squarespace to design this week.

35:22.080 --> 35:25.760
Actually, I used Squarespace to make a website for things I bought at Sheets,

35:25.760 --> 35:30.080
which you can find at Sheets with a Z, show.com.

35:30.720 --> 35:35.440
And I designed that with Squarespace, and it doesn't look very, very good,

35:35.440 --> 35:36.800
but it looks okay.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.640
It looks better than it deserves.

35:38.640 --> 35:40.960
It looks better than it deserves, and I only spent an hour on it.

35:40.960 --> 35:43.760
Like, if I spent a little bit more time, I could make it look really good.

35:43.760 --> 35:49.120
But, like, Squarespace, they really make it easy for you to make a website.

35:49.120 --> 35:55.040
And that was, don't use Sheets show.com as, like, your meter

35:55.040 --> 35:58.080
for how all Squarespace sites should look.

35:58.080 --> 36:01.040
But I did that very quickly, which is a compliment to Squarespace.

36:01.040 --> 36:04.800
So go to Squarespace.com and use the coupon code, MYBROTHER, all one word.

36:04.800 --> 36:08.960
I got my things I bought at Sheets shirt in today, or yesterday.

36:08.960 --> 36:10.160
Pics or it didn't happen.

36:10.160 --> 36:12.560
I mean, I got it in, and it's a nice shirt, and it looks nice,

36:12.560 --> 36:13.280
and I like the design.

36:13.280 --> 36:16.160
It has a very bad smell, and I don't know what the reason is for that,

36:16.160 --> 36:17.440
but I'm excited to wash it and wear it.

36:17.440 --> 36:19.520
Each shirt is scented like a Sheets.

36:20.640 --> 36:21.520
Sheets smells great.

36:21.520 --> 36:22.160
Don't be an idiot.

36:22.160 --> 36:24.240
I got a message for Susan, and it's from Grant.

36:24.800 --> 36:25.760
Message is this.

36:25.760 --> 36:26.640
It reads thusly.

36:26.640 --> 36:28.480
Dear Susan, happy anniversary.

36:28.480 --> 36:30.400
Wherever the brothers decide it should happen,

36:31.120 --> 36:34.640
I'd like to take this opportunity to pay the McElroy's to say nice things about you.

36:34.640 --> 36:38.960
For example, they could compliment you on your blossoming video game skills,

36:38.960 --> 36:41.600
your girls show prowess,

36:41.600 --> 36:46.400
or promise you they'd never lose you in a department store.

36:46.400 --> 36:47.120
Allons-y.

36:51.120 --> 36:53.760
I want to compliment you on your blossoming video game skills,

36:53.760 --> 36:58.560
but that feels like a weird like, girl, you'll be a woman soon.

36:59.680 --> 37:00.800
It's the word blossoming.

37:01.440 --> 37:02.240
Yeah.

37:02.240 --> 37:03.440
Blossoming creeps me out.

37:04.000 --> 37:04.720
Burgeoning.

37:04.720 --> 37:07.840
Your burgeoning video game skills, your development, nope.

37:07.840 --> 37:08.340
Nope.

37:08.640 --> 37:09.140
Nope.

37:09.680 --> 37:10.240
Wrong.

37:10.240 --> 37:11.120
You're flowering.

37:11.120 --> 37:11.680
No.

37:11.680 --> 37:12.240
No, can't.

37:12.800 --> 37:14.000
You won't.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.640
Your cycle.

37:18.800 --> 37:20.240
Happy anniversary, Susan.

37:20.240 --> 37:21.600
Travis, tell me about this next message.

37:21.600 --> 37:22.800
Can I read a message?

37:22.800 --> 37:23.360
Yes.

37:23.360 --> 37:26.960
This message is for Tyler, and it's from Snugglebeard.

37:26.960 --> 37:28.640
Snugglebeard says to Tyler,

37:28.640 --> 37:31.280
since we have to check Facebook to learn our anniversary,

37:31.280 --> 37:35.280
I figured our favorite brotherly trio's timely method of message delivery

37:35.280 --> 37:36.880
wouldn't be too problematic.

37:36.880 --> 37:39.520
I love you, my paycheck in a jock strap.

37:39.520 --> 37:40.880
Wait, let me try that again.

37:40.880 --> 37:43.360
I love you, my paycheck in a jock strap.

37:43.360 --> 37:46.320
I can't wait until all the jokes about you leaving me

37:46.320 --> 37:48.240
because I'm too old come true.

37:48.240 --> 37:50.240
Now, please take your dishes to the sink.

37:50.240 --> 37:51.440
Ooh, Tyler, that's no joke.

37:51.440 --> 37:52.800
Oh, Tyler busted.

37:53.520 --> 37:55.120
Tyler, you leave those dishes out,

37:55.120 --> 37:57.520
you're going to get dried Captain Crunch on the side of the bowl.

37:57.520 --> 37:58.320
That's never coming off.

37:58.320 --> 38:00.960
Also, Snugglebeard's not even asking you to put them in the dishwasher.

38:00.960 --> 38:01.920
Take them to the sink.

38:01.920 --> 38:02.880
Just take them to the sink.

38:02.880 --> 38:03.760
That's nothing.

38:03.760 --> 38:04.720
That's purgatory.

38:04.720 --> 38:06.080
That's dishes purgatory.

38:06.080 --> 38:08.480
Happy anniversary, you two.

38:09.360 --> 38:11.280
Hey, you like t-shirts, right?

38:11.920 --> 38:12.880
How about a mug?

38:13.680 --> 38:15.760
Are your walls looking a little bare?

38:16.560 --> 38:21.120
Visit MaxFunStore.com and cover all of these bases and more.

38:21.120 --> 38:24.240
We just added some amazing new shirts and posters.

38:30.160 --> 38:32.000
MaxFunStore.com

38:32.000 --> 38:39.840
Speaking of dishes, I made that candied bacon on a cookie sheet.

38:39.840 --> 38:43.120
I made it on a rack, on a cookie cooling rack,

38:43.120 --> 38:44.960
on top of a drying sheet to let the grease drip off

38:44.960 --> 38:46.800
and let the canning process take place.

38:46.800 --> 38:50.960
And I stupidly put the dish into the,

38:50.960 --> 38:52.640
put the pan into the sink when I was done,

38:52.640 --> 38:53.680
ran cool water on it.

38:54.240 --> 38:57.760
Fucking instantly, instantly knew,

38:57.760 --> 38:59.040
well, I'm throwing this out.

38:59.040 --> 39:00.240
This is going to the trash.

39:00.240 --> 39:01.920
I need to buy a new cookie sheet today.

39:01.920 --> 39:04.000
It's completely gone, completely destroyed.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.200
We'll never get it off.

39:05.200 --> 39:06.800
It was a big grease.

39:07.760 --> 39:08.240
It was great.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.120
No, it's not just grease.

39:09.120 --> 39:10.880
Grease I could work with, but the candy.

39:11.760 --> 39:14.720
The candy mixed with the grease crystallized

39:14.720 --> 39:16.240
and it was just seized onto it.

39:16.240 --> 39:16.880
It's never coming off.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.240
Justin, I want to get into this candy.

39:18.800 --> 39:22.720
Were you doing a brown sugar or a praline thing?

39:22.720 --> 39:24.080
Oh, this isn't going to be funny.

39:24.080 --> 39:25.120
No, this is a serious-

39:25.120 --> 39:26.240
I just want it to be funny.

39:26.240 --> 39:27.440
No, but it does, it does, it does.

39:27.440 --> 39:29.200
It's like in iTunes, whenever you click

39:29.200 --> 39:31.280
like my brother, my brother, me, it shows up

39:31.280 --> 39:34.080
under the comedy tab, not under the like cooking.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.480
Well, it could be 96% comedy.

39:36.480 --> 39:37.120
No, it can't.

39:37.120 --> 39:38.400
Just real brother talk.

39:38.400 --> 39:39.040
I can't.

39:39.040 --> 39:40.400
We've done, no, it can't.

39:40.400 --> 39:41.680
This won't even be real brother talk.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.120
I just need to know if it was Fraley-

39:43.120 --> 39:45.520
No, listen, listen, listen, listen.

39:45.520 --> 39:46.320
I'm not going to care.

39:46.880 --> 39:47.520
We can talk about it.

39:47.520 --> 39:48.080
We can talk about this.

39:48.080 --> 39:49.520
I'm just not going to care very much about it.

39:49.520 --> 39:50.560
Is this in the show?

39:50.560 --> 39:51.360
I can't tell if this is in the show.

39:51.360 --> 39:52.000
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

39:52.000 --> 39:52.800
All of this is in the show.

39:53.440 --> 39:54.560
Listen, hey, hey.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.080
This is our Outback Steakhouse episode.

39:56.080 --> 39:57.760
No fucking rules, just right.

39:57.760 --> 39:59.600
I'm not going to care talking about candy bacon.

39:59.600 --> 40:00.640
The people listening aren't going to care,

40:00.640 --> 40:01.360
and they're certainly not going to laugh at it.

40:01.360 --> 40:02.400
Why don't you care?

40:02.400 --> 40:04.720
Like when you care if you made it and you enjoyed it?

40:04.720 --> 40:04.960
Yeah, but I can get on-

40:04.960 --> 40:06.720
Or if you made it for you, if someone gave it to you

40:06.720 --> 40:07.520
as a present.

40:07.520 --> 40:09.760
Okay, but I'm not going, I'm going to get on all recipes

40:09.760 --> 40:10.560
and look up the right way to do it.

40:10.560 --> 40:12.000
No, here's what I'm telling you.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.680
You can't just say a bunch of horse shit

40:13.680 --> 40:15.120
and expect to get away with it.

40:15.120 --> 40:16.960
The thing I'm telling you about candy bacon

40:16.960 --> 40:19.120
is that literally 80% of the recipes

40:19.120 --> 40:20.640
you read on the internet about candy bacon

40:20.640 --> 40:22.400
are a fucking lie.

40:22.400 --> 40:25.120
They will make something that is utterly inedible

40:25.120 --> 40:26.480
that you cannot consume.

40:26.480 --> 40:27.520
It's garbage.

40:27.520 --> 40:31.120
I got a recipe from a judge on Chopped,

40:31.120 --> 40:33.920
and I tried her candy bacon, and it was a nightmare.

40:33.920 --> 40:34.240
Which one?

40:34.240 --> 40:35.440
It was inedible.

40:35.440 --> 40:35.920
Which judge?

40:35.920 --> 40:37.280
Alex, Alex.

40:37.280 --> 40:38.480
See, she knows what she's talking about.

40:38.480 --> 40:40.080
I would actually trust her more than I would trust you.

40:40.080 --> 40:40.320
Yeah.

40:40.320 --> 40:41.680
I'm not just about cooking about anything.

40:41.680 --> 40:43.280
No, but Justin's the man on the street.

40:43.280 --> 40:44.640
He's been in the shit.

40:44.640 --> 40:45.120
I'm in the trenches with you.

40:45.120 --> 40:48.880
He isn't the general directing it from his ivory tower.

40:48.880 --> 40:49.200
Justin-

40:49.200 --> 40:50.240
Just in the trenches.

40:50.240 --> 40:51.440
I love you, Justin.

40:51.440 --> 40:53.920
You're my brother, and you've helped me grow and mature

40:53.920 --> 40:55.680
and become the man I am today.

40:55.680 --> 41:01.520
And I will take a peer-reviewed candied bacon recipe

41:01.520 --> 41:04.160
off of the internet that has been peer-reviewed.

41:04.160 --> 41:06.000
I will get on LexisNexis,

41:06.000 --> 41:09.760
and I will find peer-reviewed with thousands of ratings

41:09.760 --> 41:11.680
of people saying, yum, yum, good bacon.

41:11.680 --> 41:14.320
Do you know what all the comments on every recipe

41:14.320 --> 41:16.080
of good bacon recipes are?

41:16.080 --> 41:19.920
Are there people saying, this recipe is horseshit.

41:19.920 --> 41:21.200
Here's how I do it.

41:21.200 --> 41:22.720
And then there's a reply to that that's like,

41:22.720 --> 41:23.520
that will never work.

41:23.520 --> 41:24.640
That'll set your house on fire.

41:24.640 --> 41:25.760
Here's a real recipe for candied bacon.

41:25.760 --> 41:27.040
But there's gotta be one.

41:27.040 --> 41:28.720
You are a wonderful man,

41:28.720 --> 41:31.280
but you're not the computer that wore tennis shoes.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.280
That's why I'm saying I was conducting research

41:33.280 --> 41:34.640
this morning, Griffin.

41:34.640 --> 41:36.640
If you'd listen for a second-

41:37.200 --> 41:39.280
I still wouldn't find the conversation exciting.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.440
So is it praline, or is it just like brown sugar?

41:43.440 --> 41:45.120
Just like brown sugar on top.

41:45.680 --> 41:47.920
And then I put it on a cookie rack, bake it in a foil.

41:47.920 --> 41:49.120
So you could do perfect bacon.

41:49.120 --> 41:51.360
Now Griffin, you know how to make perfect bacon, right?

41:51.360 --> 41:52.560
You make perfect bacon.

41:52.560 --> 41:53.520
There's a foolproof 100%.

41:53.520 --> 41:55.200
There's the bacon method.

41:55.200 --> 41:57.440
Start it in a cold oven, set it at 400,

41:57.440 --> 41:59.360
and wait about 15 minutes until it's done,

41:59.360 --> 42:00.400
and it'll be perfect.

42:00.400 --> 42:01.200
That's perfect bacon.

42:01.200 --> 42:04.960
I like a little cracked black pepper and cumin on it.

42:04.960 --> 42:10.320
Welcome to my house.

42:10.320 --> 42:12.160
Griffin's just playing Hearthstone now.

42:13.360 --> 42:13.920
Why not?

42:13.920 --> 42:15.760
Hey, no rules just right.

42:15.760 --> 42:16.720
Why can't I play Hearthstone?

42:16.720 --> 42:17.600
If we're not gonna do advice,

42:17.600 --> 42:18.640
if we're not gonna do the thing,

42:19.760 --> 42:21.040
now it's our Hearthstone cast.

42:21.040 --> 42:23.200
I've been really enjoying playing the priest class lately,

42:23.200 --> 42:25.280
because there's a lot of card control cards,

42:25.280 --> 42:27.680
and I like to play those and really stump my enemies.

42:28.320 --> 42:29.600
Well, I'll just talk about Hearthstone

42:29.600 --> 42:30.800
if that's what you want to talk about.

42:30.800 --> 42:32.080
I mean, Paladin's a good way to go,

42:32.080 --> 42:35.600
because then you have a lot of damage cards and healing cards.

42:35.600 --> 42:36.100
Listen.

42:36.560 --> 42:37.280
I'm listening.

42:38.320 --> 42:39.120
I don't have anything.

42:39.120 --> 42:40.640
I just didn't want to talk about bacon anymore.

42:41.680 --> 42:42.480
That's the first.

42:42.480 --> 42:43.600
Nobody's ever said that.

42:43.600 --> 42:44.800
Bacon has been ruined for me, okay?

42:44.800 --> 42:46.800
I live in Austin, and so it's like, it's in everything.

42:46.800 --> 42:50.160
It did get kind of, bacon did get kind of ruined.

42:50.160 --> 42:51.600
It's not even the, it's not the food.

42:51.600 --> 42:52.480
It's not the eating it.

42:52.480 --> 42:55.200
I don't, I still get psyched if I'm like at a hotel.

42:55.200 --> 42:57.200
I like like shitty bacon kind of this way.

42:57.200 --> 42:59.600
I like like swag weed that like snickle frits,

42:59.600 --> 43:00.640
because you can smoke a lot of it.

43:00.640 --> 43:01.360
You know what I mean?

43:01.360 --> 43:03.760
And like, I like shitty, flat, floppy, shitty bacon.

43:03.760 --> 43:05.360
Because it's the fun of smoking weed

43:05.360 --> 43:06.640
that really appeals to you.

43:06.640 --> 43:07.760
Yeah, but, but-

43:07.760 --> 43:09.520
Oh no, I'm high already?

43:09.520 --> 43:09.920
I like-

43:09.920 --> 43:11.920
I just started smoking this weed.

43:11.920 --> 43:12.420
No!

43:13.040 --> 43:13.360
I like-

43:13.360 --> 43:14.880
I'm so enjoying it.

43:14.880 --> 43:18.320
I like flat, flat hotel nightmare bacon.

43:19.120 --> 43:20.480
I still get excited about that, but like,

43:20.480 --> 43:24.160
like eating a vegetable and like you've opened up a fold of it

43:24.160 --> 43:27.440
and where you expected to find the life-giving seeds inside.

43:27.440 --> 43:29.120
There's like a bacon chutney.

43:29.120 --> 43:30.320
Like, I just can't get excited about that.

43:30.320 --> 43:32.160
But for me, it's not the eating of the bacon that's ruined it.

43:32.160 --> 43:35.840
It is the fact that bacon has become comedy.

43:35.840 --> 43:40.000
Like there, it is, it is its own sort of comedy food group

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
where it's just like, is this joke not working for you?

43:42.000 --> 43:43.040
Just say something about bacon.

43:45.040 --> 43:46.160
It's, it's like not-

43:47.200 --> 43:48.560
It's not, bacon's not a punch line.

43:48.560 --> 43:52.240
No, it's thin pig that you fried up.

43:52.240 --> 43:55.920
It's not a, it's not a, some sort of clever play on words.

43:56.640 --> 44:00.320
We just, I think everybody in the nation got so excited

44:00.320 --> 44:03.280
that for once we found something that could unite us

44:03.280 --> 44:04.160
instead of divide us.

44:04.160 --> 44:06.400
Like, I think that was the thing that's like,

44:06.400 --> 44:09.360
we're such a divided country anymore, politically speaking

44:10.080 --> 44:12.720
and ideologically, religiously, I could go on,

44:12.720 --> 44:15.280
that we finally found one thing where we all were like,

44:15.280 --> 44:17.440
you know what, let's just put everything aside

44:17.440 --> 44:18.800
and just enjoy bacon first.

44:18.800 --> 44:21.840
And it was also like bad for you, but not like cigarettes,

44:21.840 --> 44:22.880
you know, not like-

44:22.880 --> 44:23.200
Right.

44:23.200 --> 44:25.440
And it was like, we're gonna be naughty

44:25.440 --> 44:26.880
and have some bacon today.

44:26.880 --> 44:28.720
How's it, I don't wanna talk about bacon anymore.

44:28.720 --> 44:29.840
How's your guys' summer?

44:31.280 --> 44:33.200
I haven't done shit yet.

44:33.200 --> 44:34.320
Okay, moving on to Justin.

44:37.520 --> 44:38.560
Fourth of July, you know?

44:39.920 --> 44:40.800
Okay, so that-

44:40.800 --> 44:42.960
Well, I wanted, Teresa and I wanna do some kind

44:42.960 --> 44:45.520
of vacation thing, but it's hard because like,

44:45.520 --> 44:48.320
one, it's not like we have the summers off from school.

44:48.880 --> 44:51.360
It's not that much different from any other month.

44:51.360 --> 44:53.520
And now that I am a professional podcaster,

44:54.080 --> 44:57.600
i.e. unemployed, it's not really like I have a job

44:57.600 --> 44:59.200
to take a vacation from.

44:59.200 --> 45:02.240
So it's really just spending money at that point.

45:02.240 --> 45:04.400
TV has led me to believe that La La Land

45:04.400 --> 45:06.720
is like a vacation 24 hours a day.

45:06.720 --> 45:08.880
I will say that there is like,

45:09.440 --> 45:11.120
if you've ever been on Atlas Obscura,

45:11.120 --> 45:12.880
which is really awesome and I highly recommend it,

45:12.880 --> 45:17.120
the website, there is like a thousand cool places

45:17.120 --> 45:20.560
to go in Los Angeles that cost nothing,

45:20.560 --> 45:23.360
that are like, here's a weird little adventure day.

45:23.360 --> 45:25.920
But that doesn't really feel like a vacation.

45:25.920 --> 45:28.640
That feels like, I just don't wanna be home for three hours.

45:29.680 --> 45:31.040
And so like, I don't know.

45:31.040 --> 45:33.040
I'm thinking about going to Disneyland, you guys.

45:33.040 --> 45:35.840
I'm 31 years old, haven't been to Disneyland yet.

45:35.840 --> 45:36.720
You have been to Disneyland.

45:36.720 --> 45:37.920
No, I've been to Disney World.

45:37.920 --> 45:39.440
I've been to Disney World, Griffin.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Yeah, I've always wondered about Disneyland.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
I feel like it would be just different enough

45:44.000 --> 45:46.320
from Walt Disney World that I would kind of get messed up.

45:46.320 --> 45:46.720
Yeah.

45:46.720 --> 45:48.640
Like it would kind of be hard to,

45:48.640 --> 45:49.520
like I would keep feeling

45:49.520 --> 45:51.280
like I was in a dissociative state or something.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.320
I've been thinking about taking a Swaycation

45:54.320 --> 45:56.080
and let me know if this isn't funny.

45:56.080 --> 46:00.960
But it's, I'm gonna go like get lunch with my friend Sway.

46:01.520 --> 46:04.960
You know that I met Sway once when I was in college and-

46:04.960 --> 46:06.320
Yeah, you never let us forget it.

46:06.320 --> 46:08.000
We had lunch, I had lunch with Sway

46:08.000 --> 46:10.560
and then the next day I had lunch with John Roberts.

46:10.560 --> 46:12.320
Pretty much the best two days.

46:13.760 --> 46:15.280
It goes in order, those two days

46:15.280 --> 46:17.040
and then the best day ever that I mentioned earlier

46:17.040 --> 46:18.400
in the show that I can't remember what I said.

46:19.600 --> 46:20.800
Listen, I've had a pretty good life.

46:21.360 --> 46:26.000
I like going out with Sway,

46:26.000 --> 46:27.520
like different events and stuff like that.

46:27.520 --> 46:27.840
Yeah.

46:27.840 --> 46:29.440
But the one thing I don't like about it

46:29.440 --> 46:34.160
is that he always expects you to reserve a spot with the hang.

46:34.160 --> 46:37.520
He sounds like those really annoying RSVS's,

46:37.520 --> 46:39.680
the respondez-vous Sway.

46:39.680 --> 46:43.840
Yeah, and he makes you fill those out

46:43.840 --> 46:45.920
and return them to him before you can get a good hang.

46:45.920 --> 46:53.280
And then when you're on a cruise ship and it capsizes

46:53.280 --> 46:55.840
and then you and he are the only two survivors

46:55.840 --> 46:59.920
and you swim through the sunken channels

46:59.920 --> 47:02.080
and hallways of the ship to make it to the radio room

47:02.080 --> 47:05.440
to put out a save our Sway dispatch.

47:05.440 --> 47:11.520
And then he always talks about that 90s R&B,

47:11.520 --> 47:15.600
two man on 90s R&B group that he was in right before

47:15.600 --> 47:18.080
they made it huge and then they changed the name

47:19.120 --> 47:22.000
from Kid and Sway to Kid and Play

47:22.000 --> 47:24.400
and then it was like and they just cut him out of the-

47:24.400 --> 47:25.120
Cut him out of the whole thing.

47:25.120 --> 47:28.080
What are the odds that 90% of our listeners

47:28.080 --> 47:30.240
have no idea who you're talking about?

47:30.240 --> 47:31.200
Oh, 100%.

47:31.200 --> 47:31.840
Okay, great.

47:31.840 --> 47:33.680
No, sorry, 100% of our listeners

47:33.680 --> 47:34.720
know exactly who we're talking about.

47:34.720 --> 47:35.440
He's fucking Sway.

47:37.120 --> 47:38.240
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

47:38.240 --> 47:38.480
What?

47:39.360 --> 47:40.400
What do you mean?

47:40.400 --> 47:40.960
A what who?

47:41.680 --> 47:42.160
A what?

47:43.120 --> 47:44.720
I'm worried people are listening to this going like,

47:44.720 --> 47:46.000
are they just going to change the whole show?

47:46.000 --> 47:48.320
Is this- I can't stress this enough.

47:48.320 --> 47:50.640
This isn't us being lazy.

47:50.640 --> 47:53.120
This isn't us like not doing the pre-pro work.

47:53.120 --> 47:55.440
I'm looking at an email full of questions just right.

47:55.440 --> 47:56.240
Ooh, juicy, juicy questions.

47:56.240 --> 47:57.040
Extra questions.

47:57.040 --> 47:57.440
There's actually-

47:57.440 --> 47:57.680
Extra questions.

47:57.680 --> 47:59.440
I had eight questions as we can sort of say.

47:59.440 --> 48:02.640
I have like nine Yahoo's and we've got them all together

48:02.640 --> 48:05.280
and then at some point we just made this unconscious decision

48:05.280 --> 48:06.880
just to neglect them.

48:06.880 --> 48:09.840
If we don't go the full hour, like-

48:09.840 --> 48:10.160
Right.

48:10.160 --> 48:12.240
Do you remember that time we went to see the Reds game

48:12.240 --> 48:13.520
and it started raining

48:13.520 --> 48:15.840
and everybody else cleared out of the stadium

48:15.840 --> 48:17.040
and we're standing in the hallways

48:17.040 --> 48:18.160
waiting for the rain to blow over

48:18.160 --> 48:18.800
and we were like,

48:18.800 --> 48:20.320
we're going to stay in our seats the whole time

48:20.320 --> 48:21.280
and be cool dudes

48:21.280 --> 48:23.680
and then lightning struck a flagpole

48:23.680 --> 48:25.600
on the opposite side of the ballpark

48:25.600 --> 48:28.560
at which point after sitting in the rain for an hour

48:28.560 --> 48:30.640
then we got up and went and stood in the hallways

48:30.640 --> 48:31.520
with everyone else.

48:31.520 --> 48:31.840
Do you want to be back?

48:31.840 --> 48:32.400
And we left.

48:32.400 --> 48:33.840
We left because we were wet

48:33.840 --> 48:35.200
and then the rain stopped

48:35.200 --> 48:36.800
and everybody else got to enjoy the game.

48:36.800 --> 48:38.240
I think we also stopped at skyline

48:38.240 --> 48:40.720
because we also wanted to shit ourselves on the way home.

48:40.720 --> 48:41.680
We definitely-

48:42.240 --> 48:44.080
One of the best things about going to a Reds game-

48:44.080 --> 48:46.240
So we live three hours away from Cincinnati

48:46.240 --> 48:48.960
in Huntington is three hours away from Cincinnati.

48:48.960 --> 48:51.360
So it would be a day trip, right?

48:51.360 --> 48:51.920
So we would-

48:52.480 --> 48:54.080
So dad would say,

48:54.080 --> 48:55.520
hey boys, let's go.

48:55.520 --> 48:56.480
Sometimes mom would come too

48:56.480 --> 48:58.880
but I remember it being a few times

48:58.880 --> 49:00.880
it was just like the four of us

49:00.880 --> 49:02.960
and it would be like, let's make a day of it.

49:02.960 --> 49:03.840
Go see a Reds game.

49:03.840 --> 49:05.520
So we'd drive up in the morning.

49:05.520 --> 49:06.800
We'd get there, you know

49:06.800 --> 49:08.400
we'd get the mini Reds bat

49:08.400 --> 49:09.760
and we'd watch the game.

49:09.760 --> 49:12.400
Justin would fill out an application for a credit card.

49:12.400 --> 49:14.160
That almost always happened.

49:14.160 --> 49:15.200
I did do that once.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.760
Started myself on a road to financial ruin

49:17.760 --> 49:18.880
that I'm still trying to escape from.

49:18.880 --> 49:22.080
I was 16 years old

49:22.080 --> 49:24.640
and I got one to get a free Reds baseball cap.

49:24.640 --> 49:27.120
Hi Justin, they sell those.

49:27.120 --> 49:29.440
Hi dad, you had to co-sign.

49:29.440 --> 49:31.360
Like, fuck everybody.

49:31.360 --> 49:33.280
So that was a great thing.

49:33.280 --> 49:35.120
And then as we would leave the stadium

49:35.120 --> 49:37.520
and I had my like, I can't wait to get a credit card.

49:37.520 --> 49:38.480
I wonder what that's like.

49:39.200 --> 49:42.080
As we're leaving, still on that credit card high

49:43.040 --> 49:45.360
we would always stop at Skyline Chili

49:45.360 --> 49:47.600
and then have a three hour drive home.

49:47.600 --> 49:49.680
It was just like a fart rocket.

49:49.680 --> 49:54.960
It was like, do you want to sous vide yourself in farts?

49:54.960 --> 49:59.280
Do you want to fart a ceviche here in our Toyota Corolla?

49:59.280 --> 50:00.400
Like, let's just do it.

50:00.400 --> 50:02.240
We would get out and we would open the door

50:02.240 --> 50:04.080
so we got home and the outside of the car

50:04.080 --> 50:06.560
would just be like unpainted, tarnished metal.

50:11.200 --> 50:12.720
The Reds game was right.

50:12.720 --> 50:14.320
God, baseball games are so expensive

50:14.320 --> 50:15.920
because you got to get the tickets.

50:15.920 --> 50:17.920
You got to get the kids the souvenirs.

50:17.920 --> 50:21.200
You have to have the seats of the car reupholstered

50:21.200 --> 50:21.840
and then barn.

50:23.920 --> 50:24.640
Oh, farts.

50:25.440 --> 50:26.960
Yeah, that's what the joke is

50:26.960 --> 50:28.560
because the chili would make you fart.

50:28.560 --> 50:29.520
That's what I was saying.

50:29.520 --> 50:29.920
Let's see.

50:29.920 --> 50:31.520
We talked about safety patrol.

50:31.520 --> 50:32.960
We talked about cold showers.

50:32.960 --> 50:33.680
What else is on your list Griffin?

50:33.680 --> 50:35.280
I did get a credit card.

50:35.280 --> 50:37.360
Travis, thank you for reminding me.

50:37.360 --> 50:39.040
The first credit card I ever got

50:39.040 --> 50:42.320
was at a fucking Reds game for a baseball cap.

50:42.320 --> 50:43.120
What was the limit?

50:43.120 --> 50:44.240
Do you remember the credit limit on that?

50:44.240 --> 50:45.440
$16,000.

50:45.440 --> 50:47.680
Okay, at first, no, no bullshit.

50:48.560 --> 50:50.320
At first it was 500.

50:51.200 --> 50:51.920
Okay.

50:51.920 --> 50:52.800
That's good for a kid.

50:52.800 --> 50:55.200
I'd let my 16 year old have a $500 credit card.

50:55.200 --> 50:58.800
And then I got a letter that it had been extended to $6,000.

51:01.920 --> 51:02.720
And I never-

51:02.720 --> 51:06.000
And this is why we had the credit collapse everybody.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.200
Yeah, because of Justin.

51:07.200 --> 51:11.200
$6,000 credit cards to 16 year olds.

51:11.200 --> 51:11.760
That's right.

51:11.760 --> 51:14.240
That is higher than my current credit card limit.

51:14.240 --> 51:15.280
That's insane.

51:15.280 --> 51:15.760
You know what?

51:15.760 --> 51:17.600
I can't get a credit card now.

51:18.560 --> 51:19.680
Because of Justin.

51:19.680 --> 51:21.600
Because of how bad Justin goofed up.

51:23.040 --> 51:24.480
$6,000.

51:24.480 --> 51:25.280
What?

51:25.280 --> 51:25.780
$6,000?

51:26.720 --> 51:29.440
You might as well have had a blank check at that point.

51:29.440 --> 51:30.720
That is the movie blank check.

51:31.440 --> 51:33.440
It's red card.

51:33.440 --> 51:34.640
That's insanity.

51:34.640 --> 51:35.360
$6,000.

51:37.360 --> 51:38.160
But you know what?

51:38.160 --> 51:43.440
To be fair, I used that credit card to pay my tuition at Marshall

51:43.440 --> 51:44.560
and I used it to buy books.

51:45.840 --> 51:48.400
Which is what I told Linda at Universal Credit.

51:48.400 --> 51:50.560
You knew when I got that debt consolidation loan.

51:51.920 --> 51:52.880
What's up?

51:52.880 --> 51:57.440
Actually, I used it to buy an electric guitar and lots of Taco Bell.

51:57.440 --> 51:59.840
And tons and tons and tons of hero clicks.

52:01.680 --> 52:02.480
Put it on the card.

52:02.480 --> 52:03.840
I'll never have to pay this back.

52:03.840 --> 52:05.120
That's adult Justin's problem.

52:05.120 --> 52:06.640
I am adult Justin.

52:06.640 --> 52:09.360
Thank you for your waste.

52:09.360 --> 52:11.520
I got a call from a-

52:13.360 --> 52:16.240
There's a lot of bad information out there about credit cards.

52:16.240 --> 52:18.880
I got it in my head.

52:18.880 --> 52:22.480
Okay, so I saw one of those commercials for one of those like,

52:22.480 --> 52:23.680
we'll take care of your debt.

52:23.680 --> 52:24.160
No problem.

52:24.160 --> 52:26.800
We'll talk to the creditors so you don't have to.

52:26.800 --> 52:28.960
And I was like, well, that sounds like really great.

52:28.960 --> 52:32.000
And they're like, we'll get you your thing for pennies on the dollar.

52:32.000 --> 52:35.120
And I looked it up.

52:35.120 --> 52:35.760
I googled it.

52:35.760 --> 52:37.280
I was like, what do these companies do?

52:37.280 --> 52:39.520
Because that seems kind of crazy.

52:39.520 --> 52:44.160
And what I basically said is what they tell you is just to basically stop paying.

52:44.160 --> 52:48.560
And then eventually the credit company will get so desperate

52:48.560 --> 52:50.880
that they'll sell the loan to somebody else

52:50.880 --> 52:54.480
and they'll search you out for like less money, right?

52:54.480 --> 52:56.800
Because they just want to get it off the books at that point.

52:56.800 --> 52:57.920
So they'll sell your debt.

52:57.920 --> 53:01.360
And then that person who's a real dick is going to come for you hard,

53:01.360 --> 53:02.560
but for less money.

53:02.560 --> 53:05.040
And I read that and I thought, well, that's what they do.

53:05.040 --> 53:06.880
I could do that right now.

53:06.880 --> 53:08.400
So I just stopped paying it.

53:10.560 --> 53:14.080
In the first fiscally responsible decision I ever made,

53:14.080 --> 53:17.920
I cut out the middleman and just stopped paying my credit card.

53:17.920 --> 53:19.600
Because I realized I was never going to pay it down.

53:19.600 --> 53:20.800
So I'm just going to stop paying it.

53:20.800 --> 53:23.760
It sounds like you also attempted to cut out the upper man.

53:23.760 --> 53:25.520
I cut out the upper man.

53:25.520 --> 53:27.840
Just you, the lower man.

53:27.840 --> 53:30.720
Leaving only me, the lower man, to deal with this.

53:30.720 --> 53:31.840
And I didn't do anything.

53:31.840 --> 53:34.000
And for months it worked fine.

53:34.000 --> 53:34.560
Yeah.

53:34.560 --> 53:37.680
And then I got a very angry call from a gentleman

53:37.680 --> 53:39.680
who wanted some money right then.

53:39.680 --> 53:41.200
But that was for your drugs thing.

53:41.200 --> 53:42.000
That was a different thing.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.520
That was actually, yeah.

53:43.520 --> 53:46.000
He was collecting taxes on Balls Out United.

53:46.000 --> 53:46.800
And then we had an extensive-

53:46.800 --> 53:49.840
Balls Out United, listen to the words that you said.

53:49.840 --> 53:50.880
I can't.

53:50.880 --> 53:53.200
I'm trying to be honest here on our podcast.

53:53.200 --> 53:56.480
I could have gussied it up and maybe made it a cool name.

53:56.480 --> 53:57.520
Speaking of-

53:57.520 --> 53:58.480
Cool Dudes Inc.

53:59.120 --> 54:02.720
Speaking of gussying up and also your Balls Out United phase,

54:02.720 --> 54:04.720
I want to talk to you about those frosted tips.

54:05.280 --> 54:06.240
As long as we're just like-

54:06.240 --> 54:07.120
As long as this is just-

54:07.120 --> 54:08.240
I don't have enough time.

54:08.240 --> 54:12.000
I think as long as we've been doing the Justin McElroy

54:12.000 --> 54:14.160
revelation hour, let's just go ahead

54:14.160 --> 54:15.680
and dive deep into those frosted tips.

54:15.680 --> 54:17.280
I'm going to speak for Justin here.

54:17.840 --> 54:20.640
The frosted tips were a mistake, Griffin.

54:20.640 --> 54:22.400
Because you see, his girlfriend at the time

54:22.400 --> 54:23.440
is getting highlights.

54:23.440 --> 54:25.680
He was there at the salon with her.

54:25.680 --> 54:26.240
What's that?

54:26.240 --> 54:30.160
They had a little bit of leftover, you know, frosting dye.

54:30.160 --> 54:32.000
And he said, well, I can't remember-

54:32.000 --> 54:33.600
Oh my god.

54:33.600 --> 54:36.560
Did someone ask you or did you volunteer?

54:36.560 --> 54:37.840
It's been lost to time.

54:37.840 --> 54:38.560
Been lost to time.

54:38.560 --> 54:39.680
No one will ever know.

54:39.680 --> 54:42.800
Okay, so he volunteered that he wanted-

54:42.800 --> 54:44.880
He was like, oh, give me some tips.

54:44.880 --> 54:47.360
Like Justin Timberlake.

54:47.360 --> 54:49.040
And they're like, you want to get a little bit more-

54:49.040 --> 54:51.440
Hey, hey, my name's also Justin.

54:52.240 --> 54:53.680
This sounds good to me.

54:53.680 --> 54:56.080
And then so what they did was they put,

54:56.640 --> 55:00.800
I would say like 26 very defined points

55:00.800 --> 55:02.240
of frosted color in his hair.

55:03.200 --> 55:04.720
If I remember correctly.

55:04.720 --> 55:06.560
It looked very good.

55:08.880 --> 55:12.320
Do you know that I had a phase before the frosted tips phase

55:12.320 --> 55:14.720
where, you know, the, oh my god.

55:14.720 --> 55:15.920
I can't believe I'm gonna say this.

55:15.920 --> 55:17.760
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

55:18.320 --> 55:20.160
Oh god, this is a rough one.

55:20.160 --> 55:20.800
Okay, hold on.

55:23.520 --> 55:27.440
Rougher than you getting couple's frosted tips?

55:27.440 --> 55:30.160
That's worse than I ever could have imagined.

55:30.160 --> 55:31.760
It's rougher than that.

55:31.760 --> 55:36.320
You know those cans of hairspray that you use around Halloween

55:36.880 --> 55:40.080
to color your hair a certain color just as a goof?

55:40.080 --> 55:40.640
Yeah.

55:40.640 --> 55:44.400
I had a period for about two weeks in high school

55:44.400 --> 55:48.960
where I was spraying some of that blonde spray

55:49.600 --> 55:53.120
into my hair to give myself a different look,

55:53.120 --> 55:54.720
a different blonder look.

55:54.720 --> 55:57.920
It fucked my hair up so bad

55:57.920 --> 56:00.560
because it is not meant to be a daily application.

56:01.360 --> 56:02.880
He used it how much?

56:02.880 --> 56:04.640
Get him to the doctor.

56:04.640 --> 56:06.800
Yeah, go to the hair doctor right now.

56:06.800 --> 56:08.480
Justin, Justin.

56:08.480 --> 56:10.320
Griffin.

56:10.320 --> 56:13.920
Last year, you had a beautiful baby girl.

56:13.920 --> 56:16.080
You and Sydney had a beautiful baby girl, Charlie.

56:16.080 --> 56:17.760
She's a wonderful child.

56:17.760 --> 56:18.480
I'm a fan.

56:18.480 --> 56:19.680
It's, I am too.

56:19.680 --> 56:21.440
I like her new stuff and her old stuff.

56:21.440 --> 56:22.240
The whole catalog.

56:22.800 --> 56:26.800
It is a miracle that you were able to produce her

56:27.440 --> 56:30.000
that this ritual that you just described

56:30.640 --> 56:34.240
did not burn and salt your dick completely clean off.

56:36.880 --> 56:37.680
Thank you, Griffin.

56:37.680 --> 56:38.880
I was pretty excited.

56:38.880 --> 56:39.920
I'm excited for you.

56:39.920 --> 56:42.960
Now that I know this, that's a miracle child.

56:42.960 --> 56:44.240
Oh, what a miracle baby.

56:44.240 --> 56:47.360
I'm going to try and canonize her for sainthood

56:47.360 --> 56:48.800
because she should not exist.

56:48.800 --> 56:50.240
And Justin, can you tell me,

56:50.240 --> 56:53.440
did you do all of these hair shenanigans

56:53.440 --> 56:55.280
before or after the credit card?

56:55.840 --> 56:58.960
I'm just trying to develop a timeline of times

56:58.960 --> 57:00.000
I could have stopped you.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.840
Yeah, Travis, I see where you're getting at.

57:01.840 --> 57:05.920
I think that once I did have a net worth

57:05.920 --> 57:08.640
of roughly six thousand dollars,

57:08.640 --> 57:10.720
I felt like I had to live up to that lifestyle.

57:10.720 --> 57:11.600
You know what I mean?

57:11.600 --> 57:13.520
I couldn't just roll into the hottest clubs

57:13.520 --> 57:17.360
with my brown, boring, plain Jane hair.

57:17.360 --> 57:20.720
I had to go in with a three dollar can of costume shop

57:20.720 --> 57:24.480
blonde spray on my locks.

57:24.480 --> 57:26.480
The money really changed you.

57:26.480 --> 57:28.800
This has been a rough episode for you, Justin.

57:29.520 --> 57:31.280
I mean, I didn't come out of it looking great

57:31.280 --> 57:32.400
if that's what you're getting at.

57:32.400 --> 57:33.840
Maybe you should get some blonde tips.

57:33.840 --> 57:37.680
Well, Travis, I've kind of been down that road.

57:37.680 --> 57:39.360
Have you ever thought about shaving your head

57:39.360 --> 57:41.840
into like some kind of a monk's tonsure?

57:41.840 --> 57:45.040
God, yes, yes, yes, Justin, Justin,

57:45.040 --> 57:48.160
you have lived such a wonderful, wonderful life.

57:48.160 --> 57:52.320
I did do that, but that was for a show.

57:52.320 --> 57:53.920
And that was actually laziness

57:53.920 --> 57:56.480
because I couldn't commit to putting a skull cap on every night.

57:56.480 --> 57:58.960
I was Friar Lawrence and Romeo and Juliet

57:58.960 --> 58:01.440
and I had to get, I shaved a tonsure in there.

58:01.440 --> 58:04.880
And then the worst part was that I,

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
if you shave a tonsure into your head,

58:08.000 --> 58:10.240
the hair is never gonna catch up.

58:10.240 --> 58:11.440
It doesn't work that way.

58:11.440 --> 58:13.440
You'll always end up with a donut.

58:13.440 --> 58:15.440
Yeah, exactly, like a perma donut.

58:15.440 --> 58:18.000
So I was like, well, I've gotta shave it off.

58:18.000 --> 58:21.200
And let me tell you, bald Justin is a look.

58:22.480 --> 58:24.160
The best way I can describe it is

58:24.880 --> 58:30.240
if Uncle Fester and Pugsley had a baby, that was me.

58:30.240 --> 58:33.520
I had like the fat stubby Pugsley body,

58:33.520 --> 58:35.840
but the Uncle Fester head.

58:35.840 --> 58:37.920
Uncle Pugster was Justin.

58:37.920 --> 58:39.360
Uncle Pugster was me.

58:40.000 --> 58:41.360
Oh man.

58:41.360 --> 58:44.000
Did you guys have anything you wanna like get off your chest?

58:44.000 --> 58:45.920
I haven't done anything even,

58:47.520 --> 58:49.680
the tamest thing that you've said so far

58:49.680 --> 58:51.040
is worse than my worst thing.

58:51.760 --> 58:54.320
I think I had a rat tail when I was like seven.

58:54.320 --> 58:55.520
But that's fine, you're seven.

58:55.520 --> 58:55.680
I was seven.

58:55.680 --> 58:57.440
You can do anything when you're seven.

58:57.440 --> 58:58.880
I did all this for you guys.

58:58.880 --> 59:01.440
I fjorded the path for you

59:02.240 --> 59:05.440
so you wouldn't have to make these same mistakes.

59:05.440 --> 59:08.560
Oh, I will also say this towards my minkusing.

59:08.560 --> 59:12.320
For high school, my junior homecoming,

59:13.200 --> 59:16.480
I wanted to have my hair like Sean from Boy Meets World.

59:17.040 --> 59:19.760
So I parted it down the middle, grew it out.

59:19.760 --> 59:21.120
Mission accomplished, by the way.

59:21.120 --> 59:22.800
Did not look like Sean from Boy Meets World.

59:22.800 --> 59:27.360
But I did wear a leather jacket to homecoming

59:27.360 --> 59:30.160
and in all of my pictures.

59:30.800 --> 59:31.760
God, that's good.

59:31.760 --> 59:32.800
Yeah, that's really good.

59:32.800 --> 59:34.080
That was a solid moment.

59:34.080 --> 59:35.920
I think I still have that somewhere.

59:35.920 --> 59:37.600
I, when I was in high school,

59:38.880 --> 59:40.560
my girlfriend went to get highlights.

59:40.560 --> 59:42.240
So I said, let me just get some of that extra goo

59:42.240 --> 59:43.600
and put it right up in my stuff

59:43.600 --> 59:45.280
and then we'll get matching hair color.

59:46.160 --> 59:48.960
Oh, I got confused.

59:48.960 --> 59:50.800
I didn't think you licensed that one.

59:51.840 --> 59:54.960
I think you repurposed that from my life story.

59:54.960 --> 59:56.160
I have another embarrassing one.

59:56.160 --> 59:58.640
I'll just trot this out real quick.

59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.640
As long as we're just like leaving it all in the court.

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:03.680
When I was in my freshman year of college,

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:06.160
the same girlfriend who I got frosted tips with,

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:08.800
I wanted to surprise her for her birthday.

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.000
And I, oh boy.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.480
And I wanted to do something

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.800
that she had talked about for a long time,

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:19.440
but I thought just never had the courage to do.

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:21.840
I am terrified right now.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:25.520
I'm legitimately moving away from my computer and microphone.

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.120
Don't move it, just hang there with me.

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.320
Okay, I'm just gonna commit.

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:33.680
I'm just gonna go for it.

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:35.680
So I've made her put on a blindfold

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:41.760
and I drove her to Davidson's Music,

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:46.880
which was a combination CD store and piercing place.

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.320
And I brought her in the front door,

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:51.040
removed the blindfold and said,

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:53.680
this is my girlfriend

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.400
and she would like to get her belly button pierced please.

01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:00.400
Because she had talked about it for so long.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:03.840
She left a girlfriend shaped dust cloud

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:06.320
as she vacated the premises.

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:09.280
That is the craziest thing I've ever.

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:12.800
That is, that is no, no, no.

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.880
That's something a serial killer does.

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:19.120
I thought it was a grand gesture.

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.800
Okay, appropriately enough,

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:22.160
you were doing it to a high school girl,

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.320
which is what a serial killer would also,

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:26.160
that's all they intend to tell you.

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.080
If you had said, this is my girlfriend,

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:29.280
I'm going to murder her.

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:30.480
I'm not kidding.

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.000
Everything about the blindfold,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.640
the dual purpose establishment where you took her,

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.480
the surprise piercing,

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:38.880
all of these things combined are a serial killer.

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.240
If it wasn't you telling me this,

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.800
I would be calling the fucking police right now.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:47.040
That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:50.080
Happy birthday, here's a hole.

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:51.360
I'm going to put a hole in you.

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:52.880
Happy birthday, I'm going to put a hole.

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:55.920
This stranger CD, this used CD salesman

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:56.960
is going to put a hole in you

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.720
like there's a hole in all his CDs.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:01.040
While I look at this hooting the blowfish album,

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.200
I consider whether or not to buy a second copy.

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:07.200
I, she had talked about it for a while.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:10.400
So I just thought that she wanted it done.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.880
Put by a stranger and on a surprise date and time.

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.440
Put by a stranger and on a surprise date and time.

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:18.240
We're not together.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:22.960
Didn't work out.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.240
Can we end the episode now?

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:26.560
Yes.

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:27.360
Yeah, sure.

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.200
I can't think of a better,

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:31.360
more uplifting way for me to walk away

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.280
from the flaming wreckage of my life.

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:34.320
So that's in digital.

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.760
I mean, this is digitally archived now.

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:35.920
Yeah.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:36.720
This is in the cloud.

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:37.200
This is in a library.

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.800
I can't get any of these memories back.

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.720
Listen, next week advice, I promise.

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.560
This is a Griffin McElroy D&T.

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.760
Yeah, well, we had advice.

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:47.280
It's just reverse advice this time.

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.040
Just don't do anything that we've talked about

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.080
the second half of this program.

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:51.440
You will be aces.

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:53.360
I mean, don't do anything we've talked about

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:55.120
for the last 259 episodes.

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:56.560
Right, but still.

01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.080
Okay, we really need to start the episode now.

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:00.640
Here we go.

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:00.880
All right.

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:02.240
All right.

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.440
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:04.560
A lot of people have been asking,

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:07.520
speaking of when we're going to start,

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:10.240
the Totino's thing, 100% true.

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:11.120
We're doing that.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.160
That's a real thing.

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.560
Hashtag NBNBAM Totino's.

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:17.040
We have gotten so many awesome already.

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.760
I would say at least 35 usable questions

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:21.760
for the Totino's episode.

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:24.080
It's very exciting.

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:27.360
We've gotten hundreds of Totino's flavored Yahoos,

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.760
which I'm very, very excited to dig into.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.360
What date is that episode going to be on again?

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:34.000
It's going to be July 22nd, I believe.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:34.400
Awesome.

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:35.760
And that's a bonus, by the way.

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:38.480
Like we're not, this is not like the new direction

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:41.920
of my brother and me is like sponsored episode.

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:44.080
No, we'll put that up in the middle of the week,

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:46.080
or is it going to go up also on Monday?

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:48.400
It goes up on Wednesday.

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:49.440
What else do you want to talk about?

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:51.920
The Midwest or the Pacific Northwest shows?

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:52.240
Yes.

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:55.200
Well, we've got three shows coming up,

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:57.280
but we've got two with tickets still available.

01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:00.960
We're doing shows August 28th, 29th, 30th.

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:02.720
On the 29th, we're going to be in Seattle.

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:05.760
On the 30th, we're going to be in Vancouver.

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:07.680
Tickets are still available for both of those.

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:08.960
On the 28th, we're going to be in Portland,

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.320
but that one's sold out.

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:14.240
If you go to bit.ly forward slash M-B-M-B-A-M Seattle

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:18.480
and bit.ly forward slash V-A-N-M-B-M-B-A-M,

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:19.600
you can find those tickets.

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:20.640
It's assigned seating.

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:24.080
So the longer you wait, the less good your seats will be.

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:27.360
And they're selling, they're selling.

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:29.520
There are a lot of seats that are gone.

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:31.120
There are still plenty of good seats available

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:34.960
and make sure you don't, which sounds like a line,

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:35.520
but really isn't.

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.280
Yeah, I would not be surprised if they're sold out before.

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:39.520
But don't wait much longer.

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:40.720
Yeah.

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:41.440
I hope.

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:42.560
God, I hope so.

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:46.080
And if you are going to be attending those shows,

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.240
go ahead and start sending us questions now.

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:50.320
Make sure you put either Portland, Seattle,

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:51.760
or Vancouver in the subject line,

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:53.280
depending on which one you're going to be at.

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:59.040
And just, we'll also probably do live audience questions.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.280
Or maybe no advice at all.

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:03.520
Maybe we'll just talk about our jobs

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.360
and the horrible, horrible things we did

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:06.800
for our high school girlfriend.

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:07.520
Yes.

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:09.120
I want to thank John Roderick and the Longwinters

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:09.920
for the use of our theme song.

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:12.000
It's a departure off the album, Pointing the Days to Bed.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:12.720
It's a great album.

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:15.600
I've been listening to my old mixtapes

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:17.440
from when I had my college radio show

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:20.000
and there's a lot of Longwinters on there.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.480
So it's a good music option for any time of life.

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:25.840
Well put.

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:29.760
We've also made some updates and some changes

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:32.400
to our YouTube page so that it's a little bit easier

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:37.840
to navigate if you go to youtube.com slash mbmbam.

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:39.760
We have lots of animated shorts.

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:42.160
We have a couple of live show clips.

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:42.960
So go check it out.

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:45.440
Go listen to all the other amazing Max Fon podcasts.

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:49.200
There's far too many to mention, but they're all incredible.

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.240
I highly recommend them.

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:52.240
Go check out Things I Bought at Sheets,

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.640
Justin's hit YouTube video series.

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:56.880
And go listen to trends like these.

01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:00.400
That's a new show that Travis does with his buddy Brent.

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:03.760
They talk about internet trends and important buzzwords.

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:05.360
And it's really great.

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:06.480
Go check that out.

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:07.280
Go check that out.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.920
Instead of a Yahoo, a final Yahoo,

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.280
that certainly wouldn't be appropriate,

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.720
I'm trying to think of something embarrassing about me

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:15.440
that I can tell.

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:16.800
I really am having a hard time placing.

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:17.920
You know what I wish we could find?

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:20.000
It's one of the Boy Detective recordings.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.680
Oh my god, Justin and I were in a band called Boy Detective.

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:24.800
And it was the greatest band ever.

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:26.240
See, I'm not even embarrassed about that.

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:27.520
I just haven't done one yet.

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:31.840
And my life can't be completely devoid of embarrassing moments.

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:35.200
When I was in high school, we had to do lip syncs

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:41.200
and my song that I chose to lip sync was Sweet Home Alabama.

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:44.080
And I wore a flannel shirt and had a hobo bend

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:44.880
all over my shoulder.

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:48.000
And I just spent the entire song walking back and forth

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.240
on the stage, mouthing the lyrics.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:53.440
And with my thumb out, I just walked back and forth,

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:56.000
mouthing the entire, like lip syncing the entirety

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.280
of Sweet Home Alabama.

01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.360
I mean, Griffin and I also did Walk the Dinosaur

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:00.240
where he played the dinosaur.

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.120
But that was adorable.

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:02.160
He was fucking adorable.

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:03.600
And we won second place too.

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:05.360
So like, yeah.

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:07.200
I don't think anything bad has happened.

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:10.160
When I was in seventh grade, our final project

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:12.320
for English class was we had to write a book.

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:16.720
And I did write my own sort of like Tales

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:19.760
from the Mos Eisley Cantina sort of extended universe

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:21.600
Pokemon story that I had to read aloud

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:23.440
in front of the entire class.

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:26.720
And then later that day, Jack Hoover speared me into the mud

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:37.520
and ruined my only copy of the transcript.

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.360
I knew there was something Pokemon related,

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:42.240
but I forgot that I had penned my own sort of masterpiece.

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:45.440
We're all disasters.

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:46.960
I'm okay now.

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:48.640
Because now I get paid to write about Pokemon.

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:49.360
Fuck the haters.

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:56.160
Fuck the haters, and kiss your dad's square in the lips.

01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:11.360

that we've tried to fix each other over the years.

You know, some light summer listening.

Maybe you want to hear about yogurt enemas,

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:39.520
or why we tried to eat mummies for a while,

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:43.040
or why drinking cholera diarrhea sounded like a good idea.
