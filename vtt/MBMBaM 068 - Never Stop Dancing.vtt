00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:51.600
The trees are beginning to change color. The days are getting shorter. Ridiculously

00:51.600 --> 00:56.720
attractive eighth grade science teachers are getting ready. They're laying their traps,

00:56.720 --> 01:02.960
and that can only mean one thing. School is back in session, almost, for some people.

01:02.960 --> 01:06.160
A young man's fancy has turned to homework.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.880
That's right, exactly. School's back.

01:08.880 --> 01:09.840
And bonus.

01:09.840 --> 01:12.560
And bonus. Homework and awkward bonus.

01:12.560 --> 01:13.600
So sexy.

01:13.600 --> 01:17.440
This is my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern era. Today we're going

01:17.440 --> 01:22.240
back to school. I am your brother cum laude, Justin McElroy.

01:22.240 --> 01:26.640
I am your class clown, Travis McElroy.

01:26.640 --> 01:28.880
And I am the valedictorian.

01:32.960 --> 01:36.160
You don't get my name. You get a fart sound.

01:36.160 --> 01:39.600
So today we're talking back to school, everything school related,

01:40.480 --> 01:46.080
comprehensive back to school guide for the youngsters out there, and the young at heart.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.320
Just something to help you readjust to your class schedule.

01:50.320 --> 01:53.840
And the people, maybe the people taking adult learning classes.

01:53.840 --> 01:56.320
Maybe you're at the annex. You're at the annex.

01:56.320 --> 02:02.720
Griffin, how did you feel back as a youngster when school would come back in session?

02:02.720 --> 02:07.680
I just had a conversation about this. I got really excited when it was back to school time.

02:07.680 --> 02:08.880
You don't, me too.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.960
I fucking love school supplies so much.

02:12.320 --> 02:15.280
I get excited when I walk through the stationery aisle,

02:15.280 --> 02:19.840
when come August, walk through the stationery aisle of the HEB, and I'm like,

02:19.840 --> 02:21.760
oh, got to get some Lisa Franks.

02:21.760 --> 02:25.360
I was straight up packing my backpack like three weeks prior to school.

02:25.360 --> 02:26.560
I was the biggest nerd.

02:26.560 --> 02:27.760
Yeah. Picking my outfits.

02:27.760 --> 02:31.600
For me, it wasn't about the institution. I didn't care about like getting wiser.

02:32.560 --> 02:34.160
I just cared about like,

02:34.160 --> 02:34.960
see and be seen.

02:35.680 --> 02:37.680
Yeah. What fashions are going to be in my classes.

02:37.680 --> 02:42.560
And also what, whether kids were going to like my zip off khaki shorts.

02:42.560 --> 02:46.160
And you know, it's funny that it stops like three days into school.

02:46.160 --> 02:50.480
Like, yeah, got to get back. And then like, you're there for 15 minutes and you're like,

02:50.480 --> 02:51.600
oh wait, this sucks.

02:51.600 --> 02:55.600
Oh, it's the same shitty people in all my classes who all kind of don't like me

02:55.600 --> 02:57.600
because of my fucking khaki zip offs.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.360
That's why there was always that excitement when like,

02:59.360 --> 03:01.920
you're in the middle of fourth grade or something and there's a new kid.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.320
And you're like, what the, this could be anything.

03:04.320 --> 03:06.400
This isn't that dude I've known forever.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.960
And he's just like a little different.

03:08.960 --> 03:10.160
And then he's boring.

03:10.160 --> 03:13.120
I did like it though when people would reinvent themselves over the summer.

03:13.120 --> 03:13.360
Yeah.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.160
You'd come back and they'd come back and they have a French accent.

03:16.160 --> 03:17.200
Yeah. Whole new tip.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.840
But let's, let's get to the questions.

03:19.840 --> 03:23.360
Let's see if we can help you with their own back to school conundrums.

03:23.920 --> 03:26.480
I will soon be a freshman in high school.

03:26.480 --> 03:30.000
Almost all my siblings have gone to the school I'm about to attend.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.440
And they've all taken the athletic route without any significant academic achievements.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.640
On the contrary, I have chosen to be in marching band

03:38.640 --> 03:43.440
and I'd rather read a good book or play video games than play a sport.

03:43.440 --> 03:46.720
How can I deal with the complaints and negative comments from my family

03:46.720 --> 03:49.680
and students who knew my family's legacy?

03:49.680 --> 03:52.560
That's from lethargic in Illinois.

03:52.560 --> 03:58.160
So when you say that no academic achievements, your siblings are just like soup stupid.

03:58.160 --> 03:59.520
Like really, really dumb.

04:00.960 --> 04:03.760
I have a dumb family, but I am trying to reinvent myself.

04:03.760 --> 04:06.320
Hey, listen, hey, you know what?

04:06.320 --> 04:07.680
You're about to go into high school.

04:07.680 --> 04:11.360
Well, let me help you out with some advice that makes him counterintuitive.

04:13.280 --> 04:14.320
Just do some sports.

04:14.960 --> 04:15.760
Girls love it.

04:15.760 --> 04:18.480
You know, you gotta do some sports.

04:18.480 --> 04:19.360
Gotta get fit.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.840
Gotta look amazing.

04:21.840 --> 04:23.760
You're gonna get super toned.

04:23.760 --> 04:28.240
You're gonna, and listen, video games, good book, great books, whatever.

04:28.240 --> 04:29.360
You can have someone read them to you.

04:29.360 --> 04:32.400
You do that in the privacy of your own home in the dark where no one can see.

04:32.400 --> 04:36.080
You'll probably have enough time to read when you're old and married.

04:36.080 --> 04:42.000
There's not a video game alive that can help you blast your pecs and core and your arms.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.640
You can't tone those arms while playing Mario Kart.

04:44.640 --> 04:45.280
God knows.

04:46.240 --> 04:48.480
Get sinewy, get fit, get muscly.

04:50.160 --> 04:54.080
My primary advice to you would be cut it off before it's too late.

04:54.080 --> 04:54.800
Stop reading.

04:54.800 --> 04:55.840
Stop playing video games.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.920
Get in the sport.

04:57.920 --> 05:02.000
Get strong and get dumb like the rest of your sports star family.

05:02.960 --> 05:05.360
Just start headbutting your brothers.

05:05.360 --> 05:06.480
Yeah, you've got it in you.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.400
Why are you denying your gift?

05:08.400 --> 05:10.400
The sports magic is in you.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.440
I can hear you.

05:11.440 --> 05:14.080
You are from a lineage of sports stars.

05:14.640 --> 05:15.920
What about shit like track?

05:15.920 --> 05:17.520
You don't even have to be big.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.600
You could just run and jump like an MVP.

05:20.240 --> 05:20.880
Come on.

05:21.840 --> 05:22.480
Get fit.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.680
Do you know why you don't like sports?

05:25.680 --> 05:26.800
Because you're not fit.

05:26.800 --> 05:27.440
Because you're not fit.

05:27.440 --> 05:30.480
You're one of those like 90 pound weaklings and you need to send away

05:30.480 --> 05:33.680
for that kit on the back of the boys life that's gonna make you big.

05:33.680 --> 05:36.480
Hey, did you use whey and protein?

05:36.480 --> 05:37.600
Do you use protein whey?

05:38.320 --> 05:39.520
Slurp down some smoothies.

05:39.520 --> 05:41.280
Justin, give him some smoothie tips.

05:43.360 --> 05:44.880
Try some fruit in there.

05:44.880 --> 05:49.280
Put some fruit in that smoothie, you goofster.

05:49.280 --> 05:50.320
You're gonna get healthy.

05:50.320 --> 05:55.440
You're gonna get so fit and look so good and feel good about yourself.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.840
And your family will finally love you and accept you.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.440
Like Sephiroth already accepts you.

06:01.440 --> 06:04.880
That's how it's going.

06:04.880 --> 06:08.160
Charles Dickens and Kurt Vonnegut think you're the pits.

06:08.160 --> 06:08.720
Move on.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.800
Now it's time to get that Peyton Manning seal of approval.

06:12.800 --> 06:16.720
Get fit, get right, get dumb, and get ladies.

06:16.720 --> 06:18.160
Step one, get dumb.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.680
Step two, get big.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.360
Step three, get ladies.

06:21.360 --> 06:22.480
Get the ladies.

06:22.480 --> 06:22.960
I want you to get so big.

06:22.960 --> 06:24.160
Now listen, now listen.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.880
This glory will be short-lived.

06:26.880 --> 06:27.120
Yeah.

06:28.240 --> 06:29.200
I can't.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.880
This is really also important.

06:30.880 --> 06:33.440
You are gonna really regret this.

06:33.440 --> 06:37.920
Oh, then you get into college and it's like, oh, you're failing all your classes.

06:37.920 --> 06:41.520
And we don't want you on the football team because they are much bigger than you are.

06:41.520 --> 06:46.960
You got a pretty good grade in running, but you can't major in that anymore.

06:46.960 --> 06:47.200
Yeah.

06:47.920 --> 06:49.040
It's not 1930s.

06:49.040 --> 06:53.120
And if all else fails, I guess you could compete in like debate.

06:53.920 --> 06:54.960
That sounds competitive.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.800
Your family could get behind, right?

06:56.800 --> 06:57.440
Oh, that's-

06:57.440 --> 07:00.000
Boxing is a kind of debate, right?

07:00.800 --> 07:01.680
Fist debate?

07:01.680 --> 07:03.040
Like a gentleman's debate.

07:04.480 --> 07:06.080
Yeah, do that Lincoln Douglas shit.

07:06.080 --> 07:08.560
And you're like pounding the pulpit and screaming.

07:08.560 --> 07:09.760
That stuff's awesome.

07:09.760 --> 07:10.960
But he's gonna break his arm.

07:10.960 --> 07:11.600
He's gonna break his-

07:11.600 --> 07:13.200
Oh, yeah, because he's made of glass.

07:15.440 --> 07:18.240
For baseball season, when it comes around.

07:18.800 --> 07:24.080
Yeah, maybe get fit with one season and then with the other season, read.

07:24.080 --> 07:24.800
Like don't do-

07:24.800 --> 07:26.960
Oh, what if he was the biggest-

07:26.960 --> 07:29.600
The folly, because I go with a two-sports schedule.

07:29.600 --> 07:35.600
I like to keep my baseball in the summertime when it's summertime hot,

07:35.600 --> 07:38.880
and then football in the fall-winter season.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.080
Let me throw this out there, though.

07:40.720 --> 07:44.160
What if he became the biggest, bulkiest, fittest debater?

07:44.880 --> 07:45.360
Yeah.

07:45.360 --> 07:50.400
And he was just a huge Hulk of a man standing behind the tiniest pulpit.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.280
That would be cool.

07:51.280 --> 07:54.400
I would say maybe get fit, but don't do sports, maybe.

07:54.400 --> 07:55.840
Maybe your family will love you then.

07:55.840 --> 07:56.880
It's hard to say.

07:56.880 --> 07:57.760
Don't be that fucking-

07:57.760 --> 07:58.720
No, fuck that.

07:58.720 --> 08:03.440
Listen, I'm having a hard enough time out here as it is in the wastelands.

08:04.560 --> 08:08.880
I don't need fucking good-looking dudes trying to take over

08:09.840 --> 08:14.800
this very small corner of the earth that I've managed to fight off.

08:14.800 --> 08:16.240
Carve out that little niche for yourself.

08:16.240 --> 08:17.120
I carved out a little niche.

08:17.120 --> 08:19.920
I don't need any sexy good bodies like, oh, me sports?

08:19.920 --> 08:21.040
No, how droll.

08:21.040 --> 08:21.540
I like-

08:22.720 --> 08:23.840
I could be, of course.

08:23.840 --> 08:26.480
Oh, yeah, but I'm in a band now, so.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.000
I could be the greatest sports-

08:28.640 --> 08:30.960
I pretty much just keep it the hacky sack.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.080
Pretty much just hack.

08:32.080 --> 08:34.880
Just light sacking during my lunch hours.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.680
Hey, I'll be a sophomore in high school in a few days.

08:37.680 --> 08:41.760
And while I got good grades my freshman year, I didn't do a whole lot of extracurriculars.

08:42.320 --> 08:43.840
Like, seriously, I did jack shit.

08:44.720 --> 08:47.200
What are some extracurriculars that you three would recommend?

08:47.200 --> 08:50.720
Preferably something that would look good on a college application,

08:50.720 --> 08:52.800
but all suggestions are welcome.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.880
Austin, North Carolina.

08:54.880 --> 08:55.360
Did you guys-

08:55.360 --> 08:58.880
When you guys were growing up in high school,

08:58.880 --> 09:02.000
did it seem like kids got into extracurricular activities

09:02.000 --> 09:04.320
and you had no idea how that happened?

09:04.320 --> 09:06.400
Like, how you even started doing that?

09:06.400 --> 09:06.960
I had it-

09:06.960 --> 09:08.800
Where did that train depart from?

09:08.800 --> 09:11.520
Because I don't know how you got on board with these.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.600
Like, people are running around doing things

09:13.600 --> 09:16.000
and being in clubs that I had no way of knowing.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
Well, my problem was, like, this idea of looks good on a college application.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.120
Like, that blew my mind.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.560
We're like, why are you doing that?

09:22.560 --> 09:24.240
So it looks good on college application.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.240
I'd be like, they don't give two shits.

09:26.240 --> 09:30.720
In my mind, chest team and skull and bones

09:30.720 --> 09:34.720
are like the same sort of level of shadowiness.

09:34.720 --> 09:37.440
Like, I had no idea how-

09:37.440 --> 09:38.960
You just stand in the hallway and yell,

09:38.960 --> 09:40.240
I want to be chest team!

09:40.240 --> 09:42.400
And then someone comes and they grab you

09:42.400 --> 09:43.680
and they pull you into a dark room

09:43.680 --> 09:44.880
and they put a hood over your head

09:44.880 --> 09:46.560
and then the next day you're on chest team.

09:46.560 --> 09:48.880
And you go through a blood ritual to become a mathlete.

09:48.880 --> 09:52.560
I guess you have to be able to read.

09:52.560 --> 09:53.440
Step one.

09:53.440 --> 09:54.880
Step one, be able to read.

09:54.880 --> 09:57.840
I just knew how to get into the pictures for the yearbook.

09:57.840 --> 09:59.120
Like, I wasn't in the clubs,

09:59.120 --> 10:01.600
but on picture day, every time every club was called,

10:01.600 --> 10:03.040
I was like, oh, that's me!

10:03.040 --> 10:04.720
I'm in there.

10:04.720 --> 10:07.920
That's good to find clubs that look good,

10:07.920 --> 10:09.280
but are not really real.

10:09.280 --> 10:13.200
Like, we had one called, like, scroll and quill

10:13.200 --> 10:14.800
or something like that when I was in high school,

10:14.800 --> 10:16.480
just for people who did media classes.

10:16.480 --> 10:17.200
It's like, I'm fine.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.040
People who love parchment.

10:19.040 --> 10:19.600
Yeah.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.280
My favorite was getting in the picture

10:21.280 --> 10:22.560
for, like, the Latin club

10:22.560 --> 10:24.560
and the Latin teacher was looking at me going,

10:24.560 --> 10:28.880
um, I don't remember you in any classes ever.

10:28.880 --> 10:30.480
I don't believe you were extant.

10:31.280 --> 10:34.480
You could do student council.

10:35.040 --> 10:36.000
I don't even know what they do.

10:38.160 --> 10:39.280
By extracurriculars,

10:39.280 --> 10:43.120
do they mean school-sanctioned extracurricular activities

10:43.120 --> 10:46.720
or can this just be, like, off-court activities

10:46.720 --> 10:47.920
when you're not in school time?

10:47.920 --> 10:48.640
So, like,

10:48.640 --> 10:49.360
Ooh, I don't know.

10:49.360 --> 10:50.320
Like, 4-H?

10:50.320 --> 10:52.320
Yeah, like fucking boxcar racing.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.880
Like, oh, I thought you were going even further.

10:54.880 --> 10:57.440
Like, my extracurricular is, like, crime fighting.

10:58.080 --> 10:58.640
Yeah, sure.

10:59.280 --> 11:01.520
I think you should, I think you should find,

11:01.520 --> 11:02.800
make up an extracurricular activity

11:02.800 --> 11:04.480
that is not school-sanctioned

11:04.480 --> 11:05.440
because then it's like,

11:05.440 --> 11:08.240
it shows you have stick-to-it-iveness

11:08.240 --> 11:09.840
and you have innovation.

11:09.840 --> 11:10.320
Clever.

11:10.880 --> 11:11.440
Yes.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.800
Clever, clever, clever.

11:12.800 --> 11:13.520
Clever-itis.

11:13.520 --> 11:14.800
Clever-itis.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.680
Maybe you start a camp that cleans up trash

11:17.680 --> 11:18.640
in the neighborhood.

11:18.640 --> 11:19.440
Ooh.

11:19.440 --> 11:20.240
That's good.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.600
Have you considered LARPing?

11:22.160 --> 11:22.960
Maybe LARPing.

11:22.960 --> 11:23.520
Did you even,

11:24.640 --> 11:26.720
did you even consider LARPing?

11:27.360 --> 11:30.000
How does LARPing look good on a college,

11:30.000 --> 11:32.960
unless you're going for a fine arts degree,

11:32.960 --> 11:35.280
how does LARPing look good on a college application?

11:36.720 --> 11:37.920
If they don't think it's cool,

11:37.920 --> 11:39.200
they won't know what it is.

11:39.200 --> 11:40.080
Ooh.

11:40.080 --> 11:40.720
That's a good point.

11:40.720 --> 11:41.520
You might confuse them.

11:41.520 --> 11:42.480
Intimidated.

11:42.480 --> 11:43.120
Ooh, boy.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.840
If you don't know that LARP stands for live-action roleplay,

11:45.840 --> 11:47.440
it kind of sounds like it could be like

11:47.440 --> 11:48.960
a sophisticated activity.

11:48.960 --> 11:50.320
Like it sounds like something,

11:50.320 --> 11:51.840
it sounds like something you do with students.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.920
It sounds like you're farting with your eyes.

11:53.920 --> 11:54.720
Falcon butt.

11:54.720 --> 11:56.560
No, if you said you were a LARPist.

11:57.120 --> 11:57.440
Yeah.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.360
Well, don't say that.

11:59.360 --> 11:59.600
Oh.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.600
He's a convicted LARPist.

12:03.280 --> 12:06.960
He got convicted on three counts of LARP.

12:08.480 --> 12:11.200
It was a fair trial and an impartial judge.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.160
It was a pretty cool case.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.800
There's no such thing as an impartial judge or jury

12:14.800 --> 12:16.160
in a case involving LARP.

12:16.160 --> 12:17.360
There just isn't.

12:17.360 --> 12:18.480
Everybody has a bias.

12:19.280 --> 12:19.920
That's true.

12:19.920 --> 12:20.400
That's true.

12:21.040 --> 12:24.160
Are you guys ready for your first back to school trivia point

12:24.160 --> 12:26.160
from the movie Back to School with Rodney Dangerfield?

12:26.160 --> 12:26.960
Fucking Jesus.

12:26.960 --> 12:27.840
Yeah, sure.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.760
In the original script,

12:29.760 --> 12:32.320
Rodney Dangerfield's character was poor,

12:32.320 --> 12:35.200
but Harold Ramis suggested that it be changed to make him rich.

12:37.120 --> 12:39.840
Pretty much changing the entire movie to a different movie.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.960
Pretty much the whole film got flipped on its ear that day,

12:42.960 --> 12:44.560
that fateful day.

12:44.560 --> 12:46.480
Listen, he's poor and he can't do shit

12:46.480 --> 12:47.520
because he wants to go back to school,

12:47.520 --> 12:48.080
but he can't.

12:48.080 --> 12:48.800
That's the movie.

12:49.840 --> 12:50.880
That's pretty interesting.

12:50.880 --> 12:51.920
Let me throw this out.

12:51.920 --> 12:54.560
He has unlimited resources and he's able to do whatever he wants.

12:54.560 --> 12:55.600
Infinite money,

12:55.600 --> 12:58.000
but he still kind of wants to get an education.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.600
So just so I'm clear,

12:59.600 --> 13:04.000
you want to make a movie about an adult man who is poor

13:04.000 --> 13:05.360
because he didn't go to college?

13:06.000 --> 13:07.280
Like, that's not a plot.

13:07.280 --> 13:11.280
That's not a plot. That's my AutoZone.

13:15.680 --> 13:16.560
Jesus.

13:16.560 --> 13:17.600
No, those guys are great.

13:18.480 --> 13:20.560
Let's do a Yahoo Answer question.

13:22.560 --> 13:26.640
This one was sent in by Pandapocalypse.

13:27.280 --> 13:28.400
Thanks, you.

13:28.400 --> 13:34.480
It's by Yahoo Answers user I'mAllYours who asks,

13:34.480 --> 13:39.280
what are the best places for sex in college?

13:40.880 --> 13:43.440
Just curious because sometimes it's hard to find a good place.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.120
I try to do it in my dorm sometimes,

13:45.120 --> 13:46.880
but it's not easy because I would never want to do it

13:46.880 --> 13:47.600
in front of my roommate.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.360
That would look horrible on my part.

13:49.360 --> 13:52.000
So please, what places did you have sex while you were in college?

13:52.000 --> 13:52.400
Thanks.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.160
There's only one place to do it.

13:56.160 --> 13:57.120
Yeah, in your bed.

13:58.560 --> 13:59.520
Dean's couch.

13:59.520 --> 14:03.680
Sorry, Dean, asshole.

14:03.680 --> 14:06.160
McElroy!

14:06.160 --> 14:10.080
I just had some sex on your couch, Dean.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.320
Hey, big man.

14:12.320 --> 14:16.320
I just had sex on your couch, Dean, asshole.

14:16.320 --> 14:18.080
Don't sit on the middle cushion anymore.

14:18.080 --> 14:19.440
That one's mine.

14:19.440 --> 14:23.120
Hey, I'm cleaning that with my own human musk, Dean.

14:24.800 --> 14:27.360
Unhuman musk is the name of my college jam band.

14:27.360 --> 14:31.280
See those wavy lines coming off it?

14:31.280 --> 14:32.560
That's my sex steak.

14:35.360 --> 14:36.640
I hate you, Dean.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.400
I hate you so much, Dean.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.160
Why wouldn't you let me into your college?

14:43.040 --> 14:44.240
I'm not a student here.

14:47.280 --> 14:49.440
This is a conundrum.

14:49.440 --> 14:50.880
This is a real pickle.

14:52.640 --> 14:55.360
You ask your roommate to hop into the common room

14:55.360 --> 14:56.480
and play some GoldenEye for a while.

14:56.480 --> 14:59.120
Well, sometimes fucking roommates suck dick,

14:59.120 --> 15:00.640
and sometimes they'll just kick in the door

15:00.640 --> 15:02.640
and be like, sup, fucking?

15:02.640 --> 15:03.520
Like, yeah, I am.

15:04.160 --> 15:06.400
You can clearly, clearly see that I'm doing that.

15:08.800 --> 15:11.600
At my school, we had two libraries,

15:11.600 --> 15:12.960
because one closed.

15:12.960 --> 15:14.160
And one was for fucking.

15:15.040 --> 15:18.000
So the closed one was pretty much just for fucking,

15:18.000 --> 15:20.160
and old books that nobody read anymore.

15:20.160 --> 15:21.680
That's the haunted one, though, right?

15:22.640 --> 15:23.600
The stacks?

15:23.600 --> 15:24.320
The stacks, yeah.

15:24.320 --> 15:26.800
Every college has a stacks I've learned.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.120
Really?

15:27.120 --> 15:28.560
And that's a good place to do it

15:28.560 --> 15:31.760
if you're not worried about spectral observers.

15:33.120 --> 15:36.960
There's one place they love, is old book stacks.

15:36.960 --> 15:38.960
Why every episode, it's just either

15:38.960 --> 15:40.320
we're talking about killing horses

15:40.320 --> 15:41.920
or we're talking about horny ghosts.

15:41.920 --> 15:42.420
Yep.

15:43.280 --> 15:45.200
Now, someday we're going to combine those two,

15:45.200 --> 15:47.040
and we're going to have a sixth.

15:47.040 --> 15:49.760
It's going to be a TV series that lasts for six seasons.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.480
It's going to start Mandy Patinkin as the voice.

15:52.480 --> 15:55.040
As the horny ghost horse whisperer.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.400
Horny ghost whisperer.

15:56.400 --> 15:57.680
The horny ghost horse whisperer.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.600
First of all, true love waits, so don't do it.

16:03.600 --> 16:05.440
Because the last thing you need in college

16:06.000 --> 16:08.640
is like AIDS and stuff.

16:08.640 --> 16:12.800
But I think that your parents' house,

16:13.680 --> 16:14.720
when you're babysitting,

16:14.720 --> 16:15.680
when you're house sitting it.

16:16.320 --> 16:19.040
Okay, that's a pretty specific situation.

16:19.040 --> 16:21.920
When you're, can you go to a hotel?

16:21.920 --> 16:25.520
Do you have those kinds of fungible assets required?

16:26.160 --> 16:27.200
They're in college.

16:27.200 --> 16:27.520
Yeah.

16:28.160 --> 16:31.520
Yeah, but you can find like a motel eight for like 35 bucks.

16:31.520 --> 16:34.320
And is it worth 35 bucks for you to get your dick wet?

16:34.320 --> 16:36.880
They're not in high school, they're in college.

16:36.880 --> 16:38.720
This person's on Yahoo Answers,

16:38.720 --> 16:40.480
they're not a fucking idiot.

16:40.480 --> 16:43.200
Like, I need to have sex, what am hotel?

16:43.200 --> 16:44.640
Like, they know hotels.

16:44.640 --> 16:46.320
If they want to have sex at a hotel, they just know.

16:46.320 --> 16:47.920
Listen, but they asked for suggestions.

16:47.920 --> 16:51.360
But if they're dating this person and burning on the reg,

16:51.360 --> 16:53.600
they're not going to pay $35 a night.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.680
Be like, are we getting lucky tonight?

16:55.680 --> 16:56.960
Should I make a reservation?

16:56.960 --> 16:57.760
You know what, you guys?

16:57.760 --> 17:00.000
I'm hearing a lot of talk and not a lot of answers

17:00.000 --> 17:00.880
from the two of you.

17:02.480 --> 17:03.920
I say get over this hangover

17:03.920 --> 17:05.920
by not wanting to do it in front of your roommate.

17:06.880 --> 17:07.840
I can deal with it.

17:07.840 --> 17:09.760
Yeah, give him a show until he leaves.

17:09.760 --> 17:11.040
Call his bluff.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.040
Do you guys know how many people are on the Earth right now?

17:13.760 --> 17:14.880
Seven billion.

17:14.880 --> 17:19.040
Where on the Earth can you fuck that nobody can see you?

17:19.040 --> 17:20.960
Oh, everyone can see you all the time.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.480
Everyone is looking at you.

17:22.480 --> 17:23.360
Yeah, think about that.

17:23.360 --> 17:26.880
At any given point, there's some satellite taking a picture of you

17:26.880 --> 17:29.520
for Yahoo Maps or Google Maps fucking.

17:30.240 --> 17:31.440
Oh, Yahoo Maps?

17:31.440 --> 17:32.480
Yeah, I made that up.

17:32.480 --> 17:34.240
Have you guys been to Yahoo Maps?

17:34.240 --> 17:37.440
It's like Google Maps, except everybody is sort of a crowdsource engine

17:37.440 --> 17:39.440
that people can just give you directions to shit.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.160
I need to get to Dairy Queen.

17:43.040 --> 17:44.880
By the way, don't have a one-night stand

17:44.880 --> 17:46.080
with somebody you're in a class with.

17:46.080 --> 17:51.600
That's a real good way to turn math 101 into avoiding eye contact.

17:51.600 --> 17:52.320
104.

17:52.320 --> 17:54.800
Don't have one-night stands at all.

17:54.800 --> 17:55.600
Yeah, don't do that.

17:56.320 --> 17:58.480
I think it's a mistake.

17:58.480 --> 18:00.800
If you want to turn college into something shady and boring.

18:03.120 --> 18:06.960
Do you want to turn college into just a series of pregnancy scares

18:06.960 --> 18:09.040
and STD tests?

18:10.320 --> 18:11.280
Yeah, what?

18:11.280 --> 18:13.600
Listen, a ship in a harbor is safe.

18:13.600 --> 18:16.240
A dick in a vagina is not.

18:16.240 --> 18:17.440
No, it's not.

18:17.440 --> 18:18.960
Don't say those two words, Travis.

18:18.960 --> 18:19.680
Don't, Travis.

18:19.680 --> 18:20.880
Don't say that word.

18:20.880 --> 18:23.280
It's okay when Griffin says it, but when you say it,

18:23.280 --> 18:24.960
you make something dirty and terrible.

18:24.960 --> 18:27.120
A dick in a vagina.

18:28.480 --> 18:29.520
You say it more wrong.

18:29.520 --> 18:30.560
You say it wrong like that.

18:30.560 --> 18:34.800
You say it like a British dock hand in the mid-1800s.

18:34.800 --> 18:35.760
It's horrifying.

18:35.760 --> 18:36.640
Like a vagina.

18:36.640 --> 18:38.320
A hoi dick.

18:38.320 --> 18:41.520
You stress the I in a way that is unpleasant to me.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.120
So how am I supposed to say it?

18:43.120 --> 18:43.680
Vagina.

18:44.400 --> 18:44.960
Vagina.

18:45.760 --> 18:47.280
Travis, god damn.

18:49.520 --> 18:50.160
Hey, can we...

18:51.200 --> 18:51.600
Can you...

18:52.880 --> 18:53.760
And this is just...

18:53.760 --> 18:56.000
I'm still coming up with ideas where you can have sex

18:56.000 --> 18:57.360
because we didn't give this person anything.

18:57.360 --> 19:01.120
I think that can you rent some scuba gear

19:01.120 --> 19:02.400
and then like go in a river?

19:03.440 --> 19:05.360
I don't think you need scuba gear for a river.

19:05.920 --> 19:08.000
So you know, but you would need to get under the water

19:08.000 --> 19:10.960
because then nobody could see you under the waves.

19:11.520 --> 19:12.720
It wouldn't have to be a river.

19:12.720 --> 19:13.680
Do you know what I'm saying?

19:13.680 --> 19:16.240
They have scuba classes at college.

19:16.960 --> 19:18.880
Both of you take a scuba class,

19:18.880 --> 19:20.480
go down to the bottom of the pool,

19:20.480 --> 19:21.680
get that wetsuit off,

19:22.400 --> 19:23.440
take some sort of...

19:24.880 --> 19:27.760
You will need some something down there.

19:28.720 --> 19:29.600
I think you know what I mean.

19:29.600 --> 19:30.400
Like a harpoon?

19:31.040 --> 19:31.840
No, like a...

19:32.880 --> 19:36.080
It's not gonna be pleasurable.

19:36.080 --> 19:36.800
Oh, okay.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.800
This is utilitarian fucking.

19:38.800 --> 19:41.040
Like you're gonna need something.

19:41.040 --> 19:43.040
You make me so angry sometimes

19:43.040 --> 19:45.040
because now all I'm gonna be thinking about

19:45.040 --> 19:46.640
for the rest of the show is whaler sex.

19:48.960 --> 19:50.400
Thar she blows.

19:50.400 --> 19:50.720
Yeah.

19:50.720 --> 19:51.120
Does she?

19:51.840 --> 19:52.880
I heard she did.

19:52.880 --> 19:54.400
I'm gonna ask her out this weekend.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.240
So I hope that that helps you.

19:59.440 --> 20:00.320
I hope it doesn't.

20:01.120 --> 20:02.400
It's really rough out there.

20:03.360 --> 20:04.800
It's hard to find any place to have sex.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.720
That's why people are buying houses so rapidly.

20:07.520 --> 20:08.800
It's the only place you can do it anymore.

20:08.800 --> 20:14.000
Can you get a timeshare with your friends,

20:14.000 --> 20:14.960
your collegiate friends,

20:14.960 --> 20:15.520
and you can be like,

20:15.520 --> 20:16.400
where are you going?

20:16.400 --> 20:17.840
I'm going to the lake house.

20:17.840 --> 20:18.560
That is honestly,

20:18.560 --> 20:22.480
I think that is the reason why people are required

20:22.480 --> 20:24.080
to live in the dorms the first year,

20:24.080 --> 20:24.880
like their freshman year.

20:24.880 --> 20:25.200
And be like,

20:25.200 --> 20:27.360
hey, let's make it really hard for them

20:27.360 --> 20:29.680
so we make sure they all get apartments

20:29.680 --> 20:30.720
their sophomore year.

20:31.520 --> 20:32.080
And then they bow down.

20:32.080 --> 20:34.160
It does make it really hard for them though,

20:34.160 --> 20:35.920
because you're throwing a bunch of people

20:35.920 --> 20:38.560
who have never lived with another person before

20:38.560 --> 20:43.200
into a big sexy miasma of sweet,

20:43.200 --> 20:45.360
sweet opposite sex to people.

20:46.080 --> 20:48.000
Like how am I supposed?

20:48.000 --> 20:50.720
I don't possess the tools required to handle that.

20:50.720 --> 20:52.080
I'm a grown ass man now.

20:52.080 --> 20:53.280
And if you asked me to do that,

20:53.280 --> 20:54.480
I don't think I could.

20:54.480 --> 20:56.000
I think I would just like run through the hallway

20:56.000 --> 20:58.560
screaming like so many choices,

20:59.520 --> 21:00.720
partners everywhere,

21:01.920 --> 21:03.120
potential sexual partners.

21:03.120 --> 21:03.620
Yeah.

21:05.120 --> 21:05.600
Hey Griff,

21:05.600 --> 21:06.560
if you're still single in a year,

21:06.560 --> 21:07.760
that might be a possibility.

21:07.760 --> 21:10.080
Maybe a back to school situation.

21:10.080 --> 21:12.000
Yeah, that'd be a pretty sad reason to go back to school.

21:13.120 --> 21:16.720
I will be teaching a couple of intro level college art classes

21:16.720 --> 21:19.200
beginning the day this episode goes online.

21:20.560 --> 21:22.640
Aside from telling me what to teach,

21:22.640 --> 21:24.560
because I'm pretty much going to be winging it

21:24.560 --> 21:25.920
for the next 16 weeks,

21:25.920 --> 21:27.040
do you have any advice for me

21:27.040 --> 21:29.280
as far as how to present myself to the class?

21:29.280 --> 21:30.320
More importantly,

21:30.320 --> 21:32.880
how can I drop some impressive knowledge on these kids,

21:32.880 --> 21:34.240
i.e. keep my job,

21:34.240 --> 21:35.680
while also portraying myself

21:35.680 --> 21:38.640
as unpredictably volatile caricature of a teacher,

21:38.640 --> 21:39.600
entertaining myself,

21:40.240 --> 21:42.080
winging it in Ohio.

21:42.880 --> 21:46.640
Does he mean like a fucking Mr. Holland?

21:46.640 --> 21:50.640
Is he talking about like being a teacher from a movie?

21:50.640 --> 21:52.480
Is that what he means by a volatile caricature of a teacher?

21:52.480 --> 21:54.800
Yeah, I believe he's talking about something like

21:56.000 --> 21:58.560
a character you might see on the show Community.

21:59.360 --> 22:00.960
Where they're a little wacky and crazy.

22:02.880 --> 22:04.880
I see volatile and I think straight up,

22:04.880 --> 22:06.160
trunchable.

22:06.160 --> 22:06.960
Oh, yeah.

22:06.960 --> 22:08.400
I get to make them eat the cake.

22:08.960 --> 22:11.840
Yeah, like, yeah, like throwing the Chokey.

22:11.840 --> 22:13.040
This is what I'm talking about.

22:13.680 --> 22:16.400
I think that if you throw somebody in the Chokey,

22:17.200 --> 22:18.400
the day one,

22:18.400 --> 22:20.000
and you make him eat the cake day two,

22:21.040 --> 22:22.320
for the rest of the semester,

22:22.320 --> 22:23.760
you can pretty much do what you want.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.200
They're not going to shake those images.

22:25.200 --> 22:27.280
You can just skip work a bunch of days.

22:27.280 --> 22:28.000
They're not going to tell.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.160
They're just sit there in the classroom quietly.

22:30.160 --> 22:32.560
By the way, still looking for a place to have sex?

22:32.560 --> 22:33.280
Chokey.

22:33.280 --> 22:34.080
The Chokey.

22:34.080 --> 22:35.440
It's a little pointy in there.

22:36.320 --> 22:39.840
It won't be the best doing it situation you've ever had,

22:39.840 --> 22:41.600
but you'll get the job done.

22:42.160 --> 22:42.660
Yeah.

22:43.360 --> 22:44.640
Just keep Matilda out of there.

22:44.640 --> 22:47.760
I think he definitely needs to wear a tweed jacket,

22:47.760 --> 22:50.480
but maybe a loose tie so they know you're there for fun.

22:52.480 --> 22:54.720
Sunglasses and Bermuda shorts.

22:55.760 --> 22:57.040
Like in summer school.

22:57.040 --> 22:59.120
Griffin, did you say you might be a little bi?

22:59.120 --> 23:01.440
A little high, but that maybe also.

23:01.440 --> 23:04.800
By the way, what?

23:06.560 --> 23:09.120
Did you guys ever have like a really cool college teacher?

23:10.480 --> 23:11.680
Yeah, yeah.

23:11.680 --> 23:12.240
Sure.

23:12.240 --> 23:12.480
Who?

23:12.480 --> 23:13.280
Sure.

23:13.280 --> 23:15.520
This is a discussion thing, and you tell me about that.

23:15.520 --> 23:16.080
Why would you?

23:16.080 --> 23:16.640
Like, do you want?

23:17.520 --> 23:18.080
Do you want to know?

23:18.080 --> 23:19.120
We went to different colleges.

23:19.120 --> 23:20.160
Like, do you want names?

23:20.160 --> 23:21.120
Do you want office numbers?

23:21.920 --> 23:23.040
Tell me, what made him cool?

23:24.000 --> 23:25.040
Okay, I will tell you this.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.800
Most of the teachers that I had growing up,

23:26.800 --> 23:30.240
I, you can tell the teachers that don't know their shit.

23:31.120 --> 23:34.320
The ones to me that I always ended up liking and respected

23:34.320 --> 23:38.720
had never, like, never let you forget that they knew, like,

23:38.720 --> 23:41.200
infinitely more about the subject than you did.

23:41.200 --> 23:45.040
So I think if you keep that dangling over their heads at all times,

23:45.040 --> 23:47.520
maybe ask them questions that they'd have no way of knowing

23:47.520 --> 23:49.360
and then answering like they're a dumbass.

23:49.360 --> 23:50.800
What is art?

23:50.800 --> 23:52.320
Wrong.

23:52.320 --> 23:53.680
Drop that shit on them one day.

23:53.680 --> 23:54.400
Incorrect.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.960
Incorrect. I had one teacher and he taught

23:57.680 --> 24:00.080
one of the political history classes I took,

24:00.640 --> 24:03.520
and he had assigned, like, all these books,

24:04.240 --> 24:07.200
like, 12 books for reading throughout the course of the semester.

24:07.200 --> 24:10.480
And one day in class, it was this huge, like, 75-person class.

24:10.480 --> 24:12.640
He goes, did anybody do the reading for today?

24:13.200 --> 24:17.360
And nobody raised their hands, and he flipped shit.

24:17.920 --> 24:21.840
Like, just started screaming nonsense and, like, pounding his desk

24:21.840 --> 24:24.720
and just got up and walked out without any explanation.

24:24.720 --> 24:26.080
Whose fault is that, Travis?

24:26.080 --> 24:28.800
Well, and then the TA just looked at everyone and went,

24:28.800 --> 24:31.840
um, well, I guess that's class for today.

24:31.840 --> 24:35.680
And after that, I fucking did the reading every single time.

24:35.680 --> 24:37.040
Yeah, that's how you got to do it.

24:37.040 --> 24:37.840
That's what I'm saying.

24:37.840 --> 24:39.120
That's what teaching is.

24:39.120 --> 24:41.760
Chokey day one, eat the cake day two,

24:41.760 --> 24:43.040
and then no one gets out of line.

24:43.040 --> 24:44.080
And then you can be cool.

24:44.080 --> 24:45.200
They'll just know.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.640
They have to know your loco.

24:47.280 --> 24:47.920
That's a problem.

24:47.920 --> 24:48.400
That's the thing.

24:48.400 --> 24:49.680
You're never going to be their friend.

24:49.680 --> 24:52.960
Guys, I hate this, this discussion that we're in.

24:52.960 --> 24:56.160
I don't think I, you got to inspire these kids.

24:56.160 --> 24:58.960
You got to, you got to, you got to put the art in them.

24:59.840 --> 25:01.200
Can you put the art in them?

25:01.200 --> 25:03.840
I want you to, like, day one, like, when they come in,

25:03.840 --> 25:05.120
just have a little lump of clay.

25:05.760 --> 25:06.640
Sing at all their desks.

25:06.640 --> 25:09.200
And that's good because you can be like, create.

25:09.920 --> 25:11.440
And then they'll start making art.

25:11.440 --> 25:13.280
And then give them butterfly kisses.

25:13.280 --> 25:16.000
And then when they're done with their art, making art,

25:16.000 --> 25:18.880
you go around and you tell all of them how, what a good job they did.

25:18.880 --> 25:22.640
And you go to the front of class and you say, you know, I had to do this.

25:22.640 --> 25:25.040
And then you'd be like, because you guys are clay.

25:25.040 --> 25:28.240
I'm going to shape you into better people, better artists.

25:28.240 --> 25:30.000
And you just walk out of the room.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.840
Griffin, can I amend that just real quick?

25:32.800 --> 25:34.320
Except for one student.

25:36.000 --> 25:36.720
Just the one guy.

25:36.720 --> 25:40.160
One student just walk over and throw their fist onto their thing.

25:40.160 --> 25:40.880
Yeah.

25:40.880 --> 25:42.720
What is this shitty bullshit?

25:43.600 --> 25:44.720
This is vulgar.

25:45.600 --> 25:46.320
Get it out.

25:46.320 --> 25:48.400
This offends my senses.

25:48.400 --> 25:48.720
Or.

25:48.720 --> 25:50.240
I will remove one of you each day.

25:50.240 --> 25:50.800
What if.

25:51.600 --> 25:52.720
Survivor class.

25:53.760 --> 25:58.000
What if you flip it and you tell everyone that they did an okay job.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.360
But then one kid who also did an okay job.

26:01.360 --> 26:04.000
You just fucking lift him up to the heavens.

26:04.000 --> 26:04.480
Yeah.

26:04.480 --> 26:07.600
And then tell them at the end of the semester, like, just so you know,

26:07.600 --> 26:09.440
I was bullshitting you this whole time.

26:09.440 --> 26:12.080
Everyone, look at what Bradley made.

26:12.080 --> 26:15.120
It could be like Jamie Foxx in that cello movie.

26:15.120 --> 26:15.360
Yeah.

26:15.360 --> 26:16.320
With Iron Man in it.

26:17.280 --> 26:17.680
Yeah.

26:17.680 --> 26:19.040
That movie sounds awesome.

26:19.040 --> 26:19.520
Yeah.

26:20.560 --> 26:21.680
Pretty good flick.

26:21.680 --> 26:25.120
Are you guys ready for another back to school trivia bit?

26:25.120 --> 26:25.680
No.

26:25.680 --> 26:26.160
Okay, great.

26:26.160 --> 26:26.960
Here it is.

26:26.960 --> 26:30.880
One of the last shots in the opening montage is of Rodney Dangerfield golfing.

26:30.880 --> 26:34.320
This was taken directly from his first film, Caddyshack.

26:34.320 --> 26:36.400
I didn't know you could do that.

26:36.400 --> 26:38.160
I didn't know you could just borrow scenes.

26:38.160 --> 26:39.840
I didn't know you could just borrow scenes.

26:39.840 --> 26:43.680
Yeah, I didn't know you could be like, hey, we're about three seconds short on this montage.

26:43.680 --> 26:45.840
Has he been in any golfing movies?

26:45.840 --> 26:46.320
Lift it.

26:46.320 --> 26:47.120
Is that cool?

26:47.120 --> 26:52.080
We need just a quick three second clip.

26:52.080 --> 26:54.160
We're doing post-pro right now.

26:54.160 --> 26:58.880
We need a three second clip of Rodney as a cartoon dog.

26:59.520 --> 27:02.400
Can we just borrow that from you?

27:02.400 --> 27:06.560
You know, this Jamie Foxx, Robert Downey Jr. vehicle is pretty good.

27:06.560 --> 27:08.400
Do you have any clips of Rodney?

27:08.400 --> 27:13.840
Do you have any clips of Robert like shooting blasts out of his hands or flying around with

27:13.840 --> 27:15.520
rockets coming out of his feet or anything?

27:15.520 --> 27:21.200
He's teaching him how to achieve his cello dream, but we also need him in a sweet robot

27:21.200 --> 27:24.800
suit just for like a three second behind the back over the shoulder.

27:25.440 --> 27:29.040
If he could be talking to Gwyneth Paltrow like that, even better.

27:29.040 --> 27:33.040
It's common when actors, they do actually have to do that a lot when actors die during

27:33.040 --> 27:34.720
filming because they have to lift.

27:34.720 --> 27:40.640
Like, have you guys ever wondered, hold on, hold on, I can do this.

27:41.920 --> 27:46.400
Have you guys ever wondered why there's that one scene in Dark Knight when the Joker kisses

27:46.400 --> 27:47.600
cowboy Jake Gyllenhaal?

27:48.400 --> 27:49.120
That's why.

27:49.120 --> 27:50.320
I always wondered that.

27:50.320 --> 27:53.360
And then he was jousting for a bit, which I always thought was weird.

27:54.560 --> 27:54.800
Yeah.

27:55.520 --> 27:57.520
Oh, I miss him so much.

27:57.520 --> 27:58.720
I miss him every day.

28:00.480 --> 28:02.000
I was just thinking about what a better movie.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.440
I should call Michelle Phillips.

28:03.440 --> 28:07.920
That cello man movie would have been so much better if he'd been like, and now you're

28:07.920 --> 28:09.760
a cellist and you achieved your dream.

28:09.760 --> 28:10.260
Woosh!

28:12.080 --> 28:15.280
General's got it in their mouth, sir!

28:15.280 --> 28:17.280
Like, that would be so awesome.

28:17.280 --> 28:21.920
And then he solves the mystery with a few clues because he's also Sherlock Holmes.

28:22.720 --> 28:27.120
Hey, I'm entering my final read, fifth year of college.

28:27.120 --> 28:27.680
Hey, listen.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.480
Hey, listen, I did it too, buddy.

28:30.480 --> 28:31.520
Don't feel bad.

28:31.520 --> 28:35.440
I've had an amazing four years and I want to make this year the best.

28:36.080 --> 28:37.600
It's a victory lap, I wouldn't it be?

28:37.600 --> 28:37.920
Yeah.

28:37.920 --> 28:40.800
Hey, any fun ideas that you guys did in your final year?

28:40.800 --> 28:43.600
Or have you heard of any new college crazy happenings?

28:43.600 --> 28:46.560
I'm sick of beer pong and the same theme party ideas.

28:46.560 --> 28:49.760
What is it something that will push this year over the top?

28:51.280 --> 28:52.000
Graduating.

28:52.800 --> 28:53.440
Graduating.

28:54.960 --> 28:57.920
That'll really take this year over the edge.

28:57.920 --> 28:58.560
Finish.

28:58.560 --> 29:01.680
I heard that college kids nowadays, what they're doing in their final year

29:02.480 --> 29:06.400
is that they are just spending it in quiet contemplation.

29:07.760 --> 29:11.680
Thinking about their future careers and maybe some goals and dreams they may have.

29:11.680 --> 29:12.880
Got a long road ahead of you.

29:12.880 --> 29:14.240
Got a long road behind you.

29:14.240 --> 29:15.280
You've already done so much.

29:15.280 --> 29:17.920
Why don't you just consider the leaves?

29:17.920 --> 29:19.120
You're sick of beer pong.

29:19.120 --> 29:22.240
Maybe it's time to get sick of studying for final exams.

29:23.200 --> 29:24.240
Maybe something like that.

29:24.240 --> 29:31.440
I attended, we would throw an annual beach party in someone's apartment

29:31.440 --> 29:34.640
where we would fill it with sand and then have a kiddie pool

29:34.640 --> 29:36.800
and then everybody wore beach wear.

29:36.800 --> 29:37.760
That was fun.

29:37.760 --> 29:40.960
Justin, this sounds fucking, that sounds like a fucking ordeal.

29:40.960 --> 29:42.240
How did you get the sand out?

29:42.800 --> 29:43.920
What vacuums?

29:43.920 --> 29:50.000
And it was, he decided that he was going to lose his security deposit real early on.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.280
Early in his tenure.

29:51.280 --> 29:55.200
Wait, was this the same apartment that you used to play that game

29:55.200 --> 29:58.560
where everybody would go in the bathroom and you'd cut open a bunch of fireworks

29:58.560 --> 30:01.120
and dump them in the sink and then light it

30:01.120 --> 30:03.520
and then see who could stay in the room the longest?

30:03.520 --> 30:04.560
Yeah, we did that game.

30:04.560 --> 30:06.080
Man, you were fucking dumb.

30:06.080 --> 30:07.600
Man, you were really dumb.

30:07.600 --> 30:12.080
We did the game where we would put our initials in lighter fluid on the carpet

30:12.080 --> 30:12.720
and then light it.

30:12.720 --> 30:14.880
It's not a game, not a game.

30:15.600 --> 30:16.960
Well, you can certainly lose it.

30:16.960 --> 30:17.440
That's fair.

30:17.440 --> 30:21.360
Yeah, you know what I did in my senior year is I arranged all my classes

30:21.360 --> 30:23.600
so that I had nothing on Fridays.

30:23.600 --> 30:26.320
So I had three-day weekends every week.

30:26.320 --> 30:27.040
That's nice.

30:27.040 --> 30:28.480
Yeah, it was pretty sweet.

30:28.480 --> 30:32.080
And then that meant Friday was an all-day drinking day.

30:33.040 --> 30:34.320
Batman Friday.

30:34.320 --> 30:38.640
Yeah, you got, you got, let's see, Bloody Marys in the morning,

30:39.200 --> 30:42.560
mimosas at noon, and then beer at five.

30:42.560 --> 30:43.680
I love a mimosa.

30:43.680 --> 30:45.520
That's how you're gonna, that's how you're gonna put, yeah.

30:45.520 --> 30:46.880
Man, I could go for a fucking mimosa.

30:46.880 --> 30:47.440
I know, right?

30:49.120 --> 30:50.720
That is how you're gonna push this year over the top,

30:50.720 --> 30:53.120
is if you find your physical limits.

30:53.120 --> 30:53.620
Yeah.

30:54.560 --> 30:55.360
Oh, wow.

30:55.360 --> 30:58.160
Yeah, like pushers, you need to know what you're capable of

30:58.160 --> 30:59.680
before you get into the real world.

30:59.680 --> 31:00.080
Yeah.

31:00.080 --> 31:03.520
Now, do you mean things like, you know, mental effort?

31:03.520 --> 31:04.880
Like you push yourself in-

31:04.880 --> 31:06.080
No, I meant drinking.

31:06.080 --> 31:06.640
Oh, okay.

31:06.640 --> 31:08.480
I was also gonna say eating challenges.

31:09.600 --> 31:12.480
Hey, life is just one big eating challenge if you think about it.

31:12.480 --> 31:13.040
Mm-hmm.

31:13.040 --> 31:13.840
Can I make a note?

31:13.840 --> 31:16.320
Uh, after I said that about the sand,

31:16.880 --> 31:19.600
I can't remember if that's something we talked about doing or actually did.

31:19.600 --> 31:22.080
Justin, the logistics of that is really rough.

31:22.080 --> 31:25.200
If you went to college with me and we did that, that was cool.

31:25.200 --> 31:27.120
If I didn't do that, just keep it to yourself, okay?

31:27.120 --> 31:29.840
You have so many things that you did that were wonderful

31:30.720 --> 31:32.960
with that group, with that crew you used to roll.

31:32.960 --> 31:33.840
I feel like we could do-

31:33.840 --> 31:37.280
Like that time that Travis gave Brandon McCoy a concussion.

31:37.280 --> 31:38.960
Which I still feel bad about.

31:38.960 --> 31:40.880
You should, we were playing a game.

31:40.880 --> 31:43.040
This is another, this is another game.

31:43.040 --> 31:45.600
And in this game, one person would wear a motorcycle helmet.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.120
But technically it was a scooter helmet.

31:47.120 --> 31:47.840
Uh-huh.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.920
Because he bought it to ride in his scooter.

31:49.920 --> 31:52.400
And we would put the helmet on and then the,

31:52.400 --> 31:56.320
and then another party would hit that person in the head with a bowling pin.

31:56.320 --> 31:56.800
Uh-huh.

31:56.800 --> 31:57.200
The basher.

31:57.200 --> 31:58.080
Now hold on.

31:58.080 --> 31:58.800
Yeah.

31:58.800 --> 31:59.280
What?

31:59.280 --> 31:59.440
Yeah.

31:59.440 --> 32:00.640
The basher was the name of that position.

32:00.640 --> 32:01.440
The basher.

32:01.440 --> 32:02.080
Yeah.

32:02.080 --> 32:04.800
So the basher would hit that person and then they would switch.

32:04.800 --> 32:08.080
So like you didn't want to hit them too hard because they were gonna hit you.

32:08.080 --> 32:09.520
So Travis was hanging out.

32:09.520 --> 32:11.680
It was his first time as a young man, probably still in high school.

32:11.680 --> 32:17.440
And we said, hey, why don't you take a swing with Brandon, who's a sweet kid we all hung out with.

32:17.440 --> 32:19.760
He's even sweeter now.

32:19.760 --> 32:25.760
He's even sweeter now because Travis did like a kind of whirlwind, over the shoulder windmill.

32:25.760 --> 32:26.800
A haymaker, I believe.

32:26.800 --> 32:28.400
A haymaker, if you will.

32:28.400 --> 32:30.000
And just drilled him.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.080
Dropped him like a sack of stupid bricks.

32:32.640 --> 32:37.200
Now to be fair, this was a time in my life where I was just like coming into my own physically

32:37.200 --> 32:39.120
and I had no grasp of my own strength.

32:39.120 --> 32:43.440
Don't try to play it off like it's your first day under the yellow sun and you're just like,

32:43.440 --> 32:46.480
oh shit, my powers are awakened.

32:46.480 --> 32:47.680
Like you just drilled him.

32:47.680 --> 32:48.400
I brained him.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.680
I brained him real good.

32:49.680 --> 32:51.840
You had like half of Mike's heart eliminated.

32:52.960 --> 32:56.560
Oh God, I can feel Mike coursing through my veins.

32:57.760 --> 32:58.160
Help me.

32:58.800 --> 32:59.760
So he got a concussion.

32:59.760 --> 33:00.480
It's no big deal.

33:01.040 --> 33:02.160
He's fine now.

33:02.160 --> 33:03.120
He's fine now, I guess.

33:03.120 --> 33:04.560
I don't know, I haven't heard from him in a while.

33:05.120 --> 33:07.200
Since that night actually, he just kind of wandered off.

33:07.200 --> 33:12.240
I like the story where you took Jason's iguana and you went out and you bought a lobster and

33:12.240 --> 33:15.600
you had the lobster and the iguana fight and said you would eat the loser.

33:16.160 --> 33:16.960
Yeah, that's true.

33:16.960 --> 33:17.680
That's true, too.

33:18.400 --> 33:19.680
Yeah, this is college.

33:19.680 --> 33:20.480
This is what you should.

33:20.480 --> 33:21.600
That's another thing you gotta do.

33:21.600 --> 33:26.000
You gotta find a dumb, dumb group of friends and just do as much dumb shit as you possibly

33:26.000 --> 33:28.080
can so you can tell stories about it later.

33:28.080 --> 33:29.520
Yes, that's exactly it.

33:29.520 --> 33:30.000
You know what?

33:30.000 --> 33:32.960
I want to tell a story about how I need some money.

33:33.760 --> 33:35.600
Man, my fungibles are low.

33:35.600 --> 33:36.560
Low.

33:36.560 --> 33:36.800
Yeah.

33:36.800 --> 33:37.760
That's how my fun ends.

33:38.960 --> 33:40.960
Travis, will you take us to the money then?

33:51.200 --> 33:51.520
Yes.

33:55.440 --> 33:58.320
Listeners Sam and Gaby would like to wish their friend Nick...

33:58.320 --> 33:59.200
Ah, damn it.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.720
Pronunciation, people.

34:00.720 --> 34:01.440
What do you guys think?

34:02.320 --> 34:02.880
CRL?

34:02.880 --> 34:03.440
CRL!

34:03.440 --> 34:06.880
Nick CRL a very happy birthday.

34:06.880 --> 34:08.480
His birthday is August 28th.

34:09.280 --> 34:14.880
He loves pug dogs and they want to wish him happy birthday and they miss him so much.

34:16.400 --> 34:17.600
Well, they're going to miss him.

34:17.600 --> 34:18.480
They're going to miss him.

34:19.040 --> 34:23.440
He hasn't left yet, but presumably he's not there with them while they're reading this

34:23.440 --> 34:24.720
so maybe they miss him right this second.

34:24.720 --> 34:27.280
Also, hey, listen.

34:27.280 --> 34:33.360
This is going out from Liz and we need to talk to our buddy Emil.

34:33.360 --> 34:38.320
He's a fan, which is good, but pretty much we're the only thing in his life that's working

34:38.320 --> 34:39.040
out right now.

34:39.040 --> 34:40.800
Shit is rough for Emil.

34:40.800 --> 34:45.600
Yeah, he got his house broken into, got a hard drive stolen, and like all his recordings

34:45.600 --> 34:47.120
and musics were on there.

34:47.120 --> 34:48.080
Ah, damn it.

34:48.080 --> 34:48.320
Yeah.

34:48.320 --> 34:49.120
I know.

34:49.120 --> 34:50.800
He went through a bad breakup.

34:50.800 --> 34:52.880
Because he found out his girlfriend broke into his house.

34:53.440 --> 34:54.240
Yeah, hey.

34:54.240 --> 34:54.960
Hey, lady.

34:54.960 --> 34:57.040
That's out of bounds.

34:57.040 --> 35:01.200
The receipt for this message got cut off.

35:01.200 --> 35:08.640
So what it says here is the dude is S.A., which presumably he's sad, but we want to

35:08.640 --> 35:09.360
turn it around.

35:10.320 --> 35:11.760
The dude isn't sad.

35:11.760 --> 35:13.600
The dude was sad yesterday.

35:14.160 --> 35:17.040
Today, we and the dude are turning it around.

35:17.840 --> 35:21.680
The dude is savage.

35:22.400 --> 35:22.900
What?

35:22.900 --> 35:25.380
Turn it around, Emil.

35:25.380 --> 35:26.820
You're savage.

35:26.820 --> 35:31.060
There was a roll of thunder coming from somebody's microphones when you said that.

35:31.060 --> 35:31.940
Yeah, it was from mine.

35:31.940 --> 35:32.660
Wasn't it amazing?

35:32.660 --> 35:34.100
It was fucking powerful, man.

35:34.100 --> 35:34.600
Yeah.

35:34.600 --> 35:35.940
I hope that picks up.

35:35.940 --> 35:37.860
Can the dude also be savory?

35:37.860 --> 35:38.180
Yes.

35:38.180 --> 35:39.220
The dude is savory.

35:39.780 --> 35:42.340
This dude is real good.

35:42.340 --> 35:44.180
But he's not sated.

35:44.180 --> 35:45.780
He's not going to turn it around.

35:45.780 --> 35:47.780
He's not satisfied, all right?

35:47.780 --> 35:49.140
He's not sad anymore.

35:49.780 --> 35:51.060
He's not sappy.

35:51.060 --> 35:51.780
He's savage.

35:51.780 --> 35:53.300
Oh my god, the dude is a sasquatch.

35:55.300 --> 35:56.420
Sasquatch.

35:56.420 --> 35:59.140
Can we get sasquatch going as an adjective for something that's working out?

36:00.340 --> 36:01.380
That dude is squatch.

36:02.020 --> 36:03.540
He's so squatch.

36:03.540 --> 36:04.660
He's so squatch right now.

36:04.660 --> 36:05.460
So squatch.

36:05.460 --> 36:09.380
Did you see he just went and went to the big debate and he squatched it?

36:09.380 --> 36:10.580
He squatched the whole thing.

36:10.580 --> 36:11.460
He's so massive.

36:12.100 --> 36:14.580
To Nick, happy birthday.

36:14.580 --> 36:16.580
To Emil, stay savage.

36:16.580 --> 36:17.300
Get savage.

36:18.900 --> 36:20.100
Randy Savage.

36:20.100 --> 36:20.660
Turn it around.

36:20.660 --> 36:22.820
I miss you, Randy Savage.

36:22.820 --> 36:24.660
You know, I also miss Yahoo Answers.

36:24.660 --> 36:26.260
Here's one I found.

36:26.260 --> 36:28.820
It's by Yahoo Answers user Quester, who asks,

36:30.020 --> 36:34.020
when grind dancing and a boy gets a boner, are you supposed to continue?

36:35.300 --> 36:37.140
This is sort of back to school themed, right?

36:37.140 --> 36:37.540
Like you-

36:38.420 --> 36:39.860
Oh, if it's like a homecoming dance.

36:39.860 --> 36:40.420
Yeah, yeah.

36:40.420 --> 36:41.940
This is really the only time that you're-

36:43.140 --> 36:45.620
If you've ever been to a club or party or a high school dance

36:47.220 --> 36:50.340
and seen people dancing with their pelvises together,

36:50.340 --> 36:52.180
then you've just witnessed grinding.

36:53.780 --> 36:54.660
Deal with it.

36:55.300 --> 36:59.540
Sometimes you or someone you know has already been grounded.

37:02.660 --> 37:03.780
Someone got thrown-

37:03.780 --> 37:05.780
Do you know where your pelvis is at?

37:05.780 --> 37:10.420
I threw you into the pestle and the mortar and I done ground you.

37:10.420 --> 37:16.340
Sometimes referred to as freaking or freak dancing or winding.

37:16.340 --> 37:19.940
No, no, not, not that one.

37:19.940 --> 37:23.380
It's most commonly associated with hip hop and house music.

37:24.660 --> 37:27.460
Or how most kids do it at my school.

37:27.460 --> 37:29.700
The boy is in the back and the girl is in the front

37:29.700 --> 37:31.780
and they make figure eight movements.

37:33.060 --> 37:33.560
What?

37:34.260 --> 37:34.760
Wow.

37:35.780 --> 37:37.060
That's really complicated.

37:37.060 --> 37:38.740
It's really focused.

37:38.740 --> 37:40.580
Do you go to that fame school?

37:40.580 --> 37:42.900
I said left, Debbie, left.

37:42.900 --> 37:44.100
Jesus Christ.

37:44.100 --> 37:46.660
I am in the league of extraordinary freakers.

37:47.780 --> 37:49.380
I do a figure 16.

37:49.380 --> 37:50.740
Ooh, amazing.

37:50.740 --> 37:51.220
Yeah.

37:51.220 --> 37:54.500
It's basically four, just two figure eights stacked in the end.

37:54.500 --> 37:54.980
I'm sorry.

37:54.980 --> 37:56.260
What is the question?

37:56.260 --> 37:56.500
Yeah.

37:56.500 --> 37:59.540
When grind dancing and a boy gets a boner,

37:59.540 --> 38:00.740
are you supposed to continue?

38:01.380 --> 38:02.260
No, you've won.

38:02.980 --> 38:03.940
That's the end of the game.

38:04.900 --> 38:06.260
That's a pretty good game.

38:06.260 --> 38:07.620
Boner achieved.

38:07.620 --> 38:08.120
Yeah.

38:08.420 --> 38:10.100
You point at his boner and you laugh.

38:10.100 --> 38:10.900
Then you run away.

38:12.180 --> 38:13.700
There's only three stages.

38:13.700 --> 38:16.260
Soft, hard, ground off.

38:16.260 --> 38:16.500
Yeah.

38:17.140 --> 38:19.220
If you keep going, the next thing that happens is

38:19.220 --> 38:20.820
you're going to grind that sucker off.

38:20.820 --> 38:21.220
Yeah.

38:21.220 --> 38:21.860
Into powder.

38:22.420 --> 38:23.860
You mean like broken off?

38:23.860 --> 38:24.420
Like gone?

38:25.140 --> 38:25.460
Yeah.

38:25.460 --> 38:26.740
Like grind it off.

38:26.740 --> 38:28.180
Just be like a nubbin down there.

38:28.180 --> 38:28.820
I gotta-

38:28.820 --> 38:29.380
Stop!

38:29.380 --> 38:29.860
Stop!

38:29.860 --> 38:30.740
Please stop!

38:30.740 --> 38:31.460
Oh god!

38:31.460 --> 38:33.060
Why are you still going?

38:33.060 --> 38:35.380
Why do you have a cheese grater in there?

38:35.380 --> 38:35.700
On there.

38:35.700 --> 38:36.580
I just have a-

38:36.580 --> 38:38.580
You left me with a nubby acorn.

38:39.140 --> 38:40.420
Oh, the sequins!

38:40.420 --> 38:41.460
The sequins hurt so much!

38:41.460 --> 38:43.780
Oh god, the sequins are abrasive!

38:43.780 --> 38:44.340
Why?

38:44.340 --> 38:46.340
Why is this Maxwell song so long?

38:48.180 --> 38:50.260
If only we could stop of our own volition.

38:52.100 --> 38:52.980
Once you get going, man-

38:52.980 --> 38:56.020
You know what figure eight means is infinity.

38:56.020 --> 38:56.580
Think about it.

38:56.580 --> 38:59.300
The mobius strip of grinding is killing my penis.

39:01.060 --> 39:03.780
It's like a snake eating its own boner.

39:05.620 --> 39:07.620
Of course you're supposed to continue.

39:08.900 --> 39:09.620
That's the point.

39:09.620 --> 39:10.820
Why would you do that thing

39:10.820 --> 39:13.380
if that wasn't the intended purpose of it?

39:13.380 --> 39:15.140
I feel like that scene would play out like this.

39:15.140 --> 39:17.060
Grind dancing, grind dancing, grind-

39:17.060 --> 39:17.860
Oh my.

39:17.860 --> 39:21.780
It seems that by pressing my pelvis against your pelvis,

39:21.780 --> 39:25.380
it's caused some sort of physical arousal to occur.

39:25.380 --> 39:25.700
I can't help but notice-

39:25.700 --> 39:26.900
How unexpected.

39:28.980 --> 39:32.660
I don't understand why a lady is asking this question

39:32.660 --> 39:33.380
and not a dude.

39:33.380 --> 39:33.940
Like, what?

39:34.980 --> 39:35.460
It's a such-

39:35.460 --> 39:37.620
Should I make her stop grind dancing on me?

39:38.580 --> 39:39.940
I don't deserve how good it feels.

39:39.940 --> 39:41.780
No, I mean like-

39:41.780 --> 39:42.420
I'm ashamed.

39:43.060 --> 39:46.340
That is a thing that every man in his time has to deal with.

39:46.900 --> 39:47.140
Nope.

39:48.020 --> 39:48.420
You're wrong.

39:48.420 --> 39:49.220
Fuck you.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.460
You wear it proudly.

39:52.420 --> 39:56.420
But everybody gets boners when they dance like this,

39:56.420 --> 39:57.620
in this manner.

39:57.620 --> 39:58.260
Maybe you didn't-

39:58.260 --> 39:59.620
I was thinking in the 1950s-

39:59.620 --> 40:02.740
I don't think I've ever not got a boner when I danced.

40:02.740 --> 40:04.580
Yeah, especially if you get a figure eight.

40:04.580 --> 40:06.580
A nice smooth figure eight going, it's guaranteed.

40:06.580 --> 40:07.780
That's by myself even.

40:07.780 --> 40:08.900
Yeah.

40:08.900 --> 40:11.140
If I catch me in a mirror, I'm like, wow.

40:11.140 --> 40:11.620
What are you-

40:11.620 --> 40:13.060
It's like young Swayze in there.

40:13.620 --> 40:14.900
Come on out to play, stud.

40:14.900 --> 40:16.020
But it's me in the mirror.

40:18.100 --> 40:19.220
I get so confused.

40:19.220 --> 40:22.980
I'm like a parrot just tapping on my pecs in there.

40:22.980 --> 40:24.580
Like, hey, hey, good looking.

40:25.140 --> 40:25.940
That kind of thing.

40:25.940 --> 40:28.260
That little, you know, that little chestnut.

40:28.260 --> 40:30.420
And then do you stop dancing or do you keep dancing?

40:30.420 --> 40:31.460
I never stopped dancing.

40:31.460 --> 40:31.940
Oh, that's right.

40:31.940 --> 40:36.580
I never stopped dancing.

40:36.580 --> 40:39.380
I don't know what about my autobiography title.

40:39.380 --> 40:44.180
Never Stop Dancing would lead you to believe that I would at any point stop dancing.

40:45.460 --> 40:47.460
You can't cry and dance at the same time.

40:49.060 --> 40:50.020
Yeah, you can.

40:50.020 --> 40:51.700
Yeah, you sure can.

40:51.700 --> 40:54.740
And that is the answer to what is art.

40:56.900 --> 40:57.620
I'm a girl.

40:58.420 --> 41:00.020
I'm getting ready to go off to college.

41:00.020 --> 41:00.980
I'm very excited.

41:01.540 --> 41:03.940
One thing that worries me is that I've never been kissed.

41:03.940 --> 41:06.580
Is this something I should have experienced by now?

41:06.580 --> 41:09.860
And will my complete lack of experience scare all the guys away?

41:09.860 --> 41:10.340
That's from Lucy.

41:10.340 --> 41:13.780
Oh, no, that's like the best thing.

41:13.780 --> 41:16.180
Yeah, that's like, that's great.

41:16.900 --> 41:18.020
You're going to be okay.

41:18.980 --> 41:21.380
College is high school.

41:21.380 --> 41:25.220
I don't think is organically built to do a lot of kissing.

41:25.220 --> 41:27.700
I think people get some kissing done in there.

41:28.180 --> 41:33.140
But I think that college is even a more flexible environment for for kissing.

41:33.140 --> 41:35.140
To have to facilitate that.

41:36.020 --> 41:38.420
Lucy, can I can I share something with you?

41:38.420 --> 41:42.900
I'm going to tell you a guy's secret and Justin Griffin, feel free to to deny this.

41:44.180 --> 41:50.820
When a guy meets a girl that he's interested in, he immediately worries about how he compares

41:50.820 --> 41:54.260
to every guy that she's been with before in every respect.

41:55.060 --> 41:58.020
And if you were straight up like, nope, you're the you're the first one.

41:59.060 --> 42:01.780
That guy has got it on easy street.

42:01.780 --> 42:03.460
I'm not worried about the guy in this situation.

42:03.460 --> 42:08.580
I'm worried about I'm worried about dear, dear little Lucy here because she she's just

42:08.580 --> 42:17.380
going to get you high school is good for just getting the shit beat out of you in every

42:17.380 --> 42:17.860
way.

42:17.860 --> 42:23.540
What imaginable not like physically, maybe, but like emotionally, spiritually, like you

42:23.540 --> 42:29.060
are supposed to get fucking hurt in high school, supposed to get destroyed, build up those

42:29.060 --> 42:36.420
love walls, and I'm worried about you in college, I finding a finding the wrong one, the wrong

42:36.420 --> 42:37.060
person.

42:37.060 --> 42:42.820
And that's so late in the game to like get hurt like that to get to get roughed up, you

42:42.820 --> 42:43.320
know.

42:44.420 --> 42:46.020
You got to be careful is what I'm saying.

42:46.020 --> 42:49.780
You got to make sure you can't you can't give your your kiss flower.

42:49.780 --> 42:50.280
Yes.

42:50.280 --> 42:52.740
To the first Johnny come lately.

42:52.740 --> 42:54.580
And you certainly can't call it that.

42:54.580 --> 42:55.080
No.

42:55.940 --> 42:56.440
Please.

42:56.440 --> 42:58.340
Did that not did you not like that?

42:58.340 --> 42:59.060
Did you not like that?

42:59.780 --> 43:00.580
Kiss flower?

43:00.580 --> 43:02.980
No, I think that's pretty much the grossest thing.

43:02.980 --> 43:07.700
I think that's a good way to keep away all of the crappy dudes and be like, I'm sorry,

43:07.700 --> 43:09.220
I can't give you my kiss flower.

43:09.220 --> 43:12.020
I don't want some shifty Lothario to come.

43:13.780 --> 43:15.860
Oh, God, hey, this is getting worse.

43:15.860 --> 43:16.360
Uh huh.

43:17.060 --> 43:23.220
You when you're in high school, you know, the thing about the populations is when you're

43:23.220 --> 43:29.060
here, as you get into progressively larger populations of humans, the chances that you're

43:29.060 --> 43:34.260
going to meet somebody who you really, really click with continues to increase.

43:35.060 --> 43:37.700
So elementary school, no chance.

43:37.700 --> 43:41.700
No one's ever fallen in love in elementary school, middle school, middle school.

43:41.700 --> 43:42.500
No, never happened.

43:42.500 --> 43:44.180
Why don't you go watch the time traveler's wife?

43:46.180 --> 43:47.220
High school.

43:47.220 --> 43:48.660
I would rather do that.

43:48.660 --> 43:49.220
High school.

43:50.100 --> 43:50.900
Yes, maybe.

43:50.900 --> 43:53.620
But like when you get to college, the population is so wide.

43:53.620 --> 43:57.380
You're going to meet a lot of guys that are like, just just your sword.

43:57.380 --> 43:58.980
And it's not going to be a big deal.

43:58.980 --> 43:59.940
You know, you kiss once.

43:59.940 --> 44:01.300
It's like, OK, this problem is over.

44:01.860 --> 44:02.820
But it's behind you.

44:02.820 --> 44:05.860
Just don't, you know, don't make yourself sick worrying about this is.

44:05.860 --> 44:09.380
This is what I'm worried about, though, is that in college I met so many women who are

44:09.380 --> 44:13.940
just like me, except for one thing, and that was that they were fucking terrible, except

44:13.940 --> 44:17.540
for the one thing is that they were fucking terrible people like, oh, you're just you

44:17.540 --> 44:20.500
like all the things I like and we have such similar life experiences.

44:20.500 --> 44:21.940
Except you're kind of a bitch.

44:21.940 --> 44:23.380
Like, you kind of suck.

44:23.380 --> 44:25.860
I kind of don't like being around you.

44:25.860 --> 44:28.900
But this is but Griffin, that's the human dance.

44:28.900 --> 44:29.700
It's the experience.

44:29.700 --> 44:30.340
What about this?

44:30.340 --> 44:35.700
What Lucy needs is a jaded, bitchy best friend who is older than her.

44:35.700 --> 44:39.540
Yeah, that's going to straight up when Lucy meets a guy, bitchy best friend is like, I

44:39.540 --> 44:39.940
don't know.

44:39.940 --> 44:40.500
I'd watch out.

44:40.500 --> 44:41.780
He seems like a real douche to me.

44:42.580 --> 44:43.940
Like so my guy.

44:43.940 --> 44:45.780
Yeah, friend who's going to like watch your back.

44:45.780 --> 44:46.820
So sassy.

44:46.820 --> 44:47.380
I like that.

44:47.380 --> 44:50.980
Because you're going to lose, he's going to fall, you're going to fall so hard for the

44:50.980 --> 44:54.100
first time that you that you meet that takes your kiss flower.

44:54.100 --> 44:58.020
And like, you just you got to make sure that he's a good guy.

44:58.020 --> 44:59.700
You got to make sure he's a nice guy.

44:59.700 --> 45:01.620
And don't rush in anything you're not comfortable with.

45:01.620 --> 45:06.020
Please, Lucy, in in in your excitement over this growing up way too fast.

45:06.020 --> 45:07.860
Just tell just promises you'll be careful.

45:07.860 --> 45:08.580
You'll be cool.

45:09.140 --> 45:13.540
You're not a freak is the most important part because everybody everybody's going it's an

45:13.540 --> 45:18.180
even terrifying playing field going to college because it's there's nobody knows what they're

45:18.180 --> 45:18.740
doing there.

45:18.740 --> 45:22.980
So when I went into when I went into my freshman year in college, I'd never done the butt.

45:22.980 --> 45:23.780
So exactly.

45:24.340 --> 45:26.900
The butt is the latest dance craze.

45:28.020 --> 45:31.860
Just I never there are very few dances that Justin's not proficient at.

45:31.860 --> 45:33.380
And the butt was one of them.

45:33.940 --> 45:36.100
Now that number has dropped to zero.

45:36.100 --> 45:37.460
Except when new ones are invented.

45:38.100 --> 45:39.060
I'm doing the butt right now.

45:40.180 --> 45:41.540
I'm doing the ducky.

45:41.540 --> 45:46.740
Oh, man, Travis, if you get a moment after the call, can you teach me how to dougie?

45:46.740 --> 45:47.860
Um, I'll see.

45:47.860 --> 45:48.740
I got some flashcards.

45:48.740 --> 45:51.220
I could loan you till I'm able to be there.

45:51.220 --> 45:52.020
That would be great.

45:52.020 --> 45:55.380
I need something that's sort of like your baby can read.

45:56.340 --> 45:57.700
But your baby can dougie.

45:57.700 --> 46:05.780
OK, people seem to really like it last week when I when I bleeped out a swear word and

46:05.780 --> 46:06.900
they all wanted to know what it was.

46:06.900 --> 46:11.860
So I think this week I'm going to bleep out because it was really too gross to say.

46:12.980 --> 46:14.580
So I'm I'm sorry, everybody.

46:15.300 --> 46:17.540
But did you just say it again or for saying?

46:21.060 --> 46:22.260
It's going to be a good long beep.

46:23.220 --> 46:27.300
Hey, and don't ask me what the word don't tweet at me and text me and ask the word is

46:27.300 --> 46:29.140
because it's a secret for my brother's.

46:32.100 --> 46:33.860
Will you bleep it out if we say it?

46:33.860 --> 46:36.820
Um, maybe let's find out.

46:36.820 --> 46:37.940
Yeah, I think I did.

46:37.940 --> 46:40.900
OK, so here's another catty.

46:40.900 --> 46:42.180
Uh, fuck shit.

46:42.180 --> 46:42.580
Hold on.

46:43.140 --> 46:43.940
You fucked up.

46:44.740 --> 46:46.260
Here's another outtakes.

46:46.260 --> 46:46.760
Fuck!

46:47.540 --> 46:49.540
So here's another back to school tidbit.

46:50.100 --> 46:54.100
Um, there's a scene where Derek distracts the opposing team's divers.

46:54.100 --> 46:58.340
Um, it's not included when it's shown on TV because the actions he takes would have

46:58.340 --> 47:00.260
gotten him arrested in real life.

47:00.260 --> 47:02.420
I feel that that's a funny bit of editing.

47:02.420 --> 47:06.500
If you went through every fucking 80s movie and said, oh, no, in real life, that would

47:06.500 --> 47:08.500
get them in some serious trouble.

47:08.500 --> 47:12.100
Like every 80s movie on TV would be like 20 minutes long.

47:12.100 --> 47:15.780
Yeah, um, that gave us a real doggy doodoo with the lawn.

47:15.780 --> 47:18.260
Wait a minute, you can't put a horse in that bedroom.

47:18.260 --> 47:19.300
Get out of here.

47:19.300 --> 47:20.740
Hear it right out, mister.

47:21.780 --> 47:27.540
Did you guys know that in the film Billy Madison during the academic decathlon when Billy pulls

47:27.540 --> 47:32.260
his shoe out of the liquid liquid nitrogen after freezing it, it's a right shoe, but

47:32.260 --> 47:37.460
he's still wearing his right shoe, little continuity air tucked away in Billy Madison.

47:37.460 --> 47:39.860
So now we switch from trivia to goofs.

47:39.860 --> 47:43.540
These are this is our podcast, Top Goofs Movies.

47:45.540 --> 47:50.020
Guys, the suntan lotion smiley face on Billy's chest at the beginning of the film changes

47:50.020 --> 47:51.620
drastically between shots.

47:53.220 --> 47:54.020
Say what?

47:54.020 --> 47:55.620
Who's watching Billy Madison?

47:55.620 --> 47:58.980
Say what, who's watching Billy Madison going, whoa, whoa, whoa.

47:59.620 --> 48:01.780
The frown was bigger than the eyes before.

48:02.660 --> 48:04.020
I am that person.

48:05.300 --> 48:06.660
You're not reading these, are you?

48:06.660 --> 48:08.180
You know these from heart.

48:08.180 --> 48:10.660
Listen up, Director Tamra Davis.

48:10.660 --> 48:15.620
You need to do better because that smiley face tan lotion is changes.

48:15.620 --> 48:20.660
It changed drastically from moment to moment through the course of that one scene.

48:20.660 --> 48:24.740
Or like his the belly cream is like a frowny face or what?

48:24.740 --> 48:25.700
What's the deal?

48:25.700 --> 48:31.700
Guys, I'd like to read you a user review of the movie Billy Madison, if I could.

48:35.220 --> 48:39.780
This is one of those lucky cases where the opening sequence of a movie gives you an excellent

48:39.780 --> 48:41.060
idea of what you're in for.

48:41.860 --> 48:46.180
If you do not enjoy Billy's sunblock song or the bit with the penguin, then you must

48:46.180 --> 48:49.300
turn off the movie and stop being such a nag about it.

48:49.300 --> 48:53.380
But for those of us who happen to enjoy movies that are silly and stupid, this is one of

48:53.380 --> 48:54.420
the best ones out there.

48:55.380 --> 48:56.420
Seven stars.

48:59.460 --> 49:00.420
Is that a thing?

49:01.460 --> 49:01.960
Yep.

49:02.580 --> 49:05.060
34 out of 49 people found that review useful.

49:05.060 --> 49:06.020
I'm going to use that.

49:08.020 --> 49:09.300
I want to use that information.

49:09.300 --> 49:11.300
That's going straight into my thesis.

49:13.300 --> 49:15.860
This review may contain spoilers.

49:15.860 --> 49:17.460
This review may contain spoilers.

49:19.860 --> 49:20.980
Makes it through school.

49:23.700 --> 49:24.180
That's it.

49:26.260 --> 49:32.500
So when Harry and Sally enter the diner in 1977, the credit card sticker on the door

49:32.500 --> 49:33.540
reads MasterCard.

49:33.540 --> 49:37.460
But at the time, the company was known as MasterCharge and the current name was only

49:37.460 --> 49:38.660
adopted in 1979.

49:39.860 --> 49:41.620
Just something for you guys to think about.

49:41.620 --> 49:42.120
Awesome.

49:43.460 --> 49:44.900
That's not really a back to school movie.

49:44.900 --> 49:46.580
Kangaroo Jack.

49:47.540 --> 49:48.040
Search.

49:49.940 --> 49:50.440
Trivia.

49:51.540 --> 49:56.340
Jerry O'Connell made the worst decision of his life and was in this movie with Anthony

49:56.340 --> 49:56.840
Anderson.

49:58.180 --> 50:01.460
You say that, but you don't say that when he gets those $16 residual checks.

50:03.380 --> 50:04.740
Thanks, Jack.

50:04.740 --> 50:06.020
I can eat this week.

50:07.540 --> 50:09.460
He calls it his kangaroo smackers.

50:09.460 --> 50:16.900
Oh, Jerry O'Connell, I wish I could slide you to another universe where you were still

50:16.900 --> 50:17.400
doing it.

50:18.340 --> 50:20.820
I just want some more episodes of My Secret Identity.

50:20.820 --> 50:22.020
Is that possible?

50:22.660 --> 50:24.340
God, he's been in a lot of stuff, huh?

50:24.340 --> 50:24.900
He sure has.

50:24.900 --> 50:25.940
You can't keep him down.

50:26.660 --> 50:27.860
Seen him in Piranha 3D.

50:27.860 --> 50:28.420
He was great.

50:29.140 --> 50:29.780
Hey, Griffin.

50:29.780 --> 50:32.260
I think he wrote this Yahoo answer that was sent in.

50:32.260 --> 50:32.580
Okay.

50:32.580 --> 50:33.940
Also by Pandapocalypse.

50:34.580 --> 50:37.620
A rare double from Pandapocalypse.

50:37.620 --> 50:38.100
Thank you.

50:38.100 --> 50:40.660
It's by Yahoo Answers user Christian Vaughn, who asks,

50:41.540 --> 50:45.700
A girl in my science class took my hand and put it on her breast?

50:48.100 --> 50:49.140
I don't know her that well.

50:49.140 --> 50:50.660
And does this mean something?

50:50.660 --> 50:53.460
BTW, I can't find a good category for this one.

50:54.020 --> 50:54.580
Oh, shit.

50:54.580 --> 50:55.940
He put it in women's health.

50:58.180 --> 50:59.060
She wanted a check.

51:00.020 --> 51:03.460
Hey, could you look for lumps for me real quick in the middle of science class?

51:03.460 --> 51:04.340
This is science.

51:04.340 --> 51:05.060
Palpate me.

51:05.060 --> 51:05.540
I need it.

51:06.100 --> 51:06.820
I might bleep that one out too.

51:06.820 --> 51:08.180
Kids are the worst, aren't they?

51:08.180 --> 51:08.420
Yeah.

51:08.980 --> 51:10.340
This didn't happen to me.

51:10.340 --> 51:12.660
I can't tell if this means something.

51:12.660 --> 51:14.980
Fucking of course it means something.

51:14.980 --> 51:16.820
How could it not mean something?

51:16.820 --> 51:19.140
Griffin, but I'm going to tell you a little bit deeper.

51:19.140 --> 51:24.180
What if he's asking, like, does it mean something in like a Da Vinci code kind of way?

51:24.900 --> 51:26.420
Does it have a bigger meaning in the-

51:26.420 --> 51:29.060
Yeah, like what's she telling me about myself?

51:29.620 --> 51:33.620
I think it means that Jesus had a son.

51:34.260 --> 51:35.060
That's what Da Vinci-

51:35.060 --> 51:37.940
The codex has been cracked.

51:37.940 --> 51:38.820
You've done it, Griffin.

51:40.020 --> 51:42.020
I mean, like, it means something in the most-

51:42.820 --> 51:45.620
It means she wanted you to put your fucking hand on her breasts.

51:45.620 --> 51:47.220
Like, yeah, it meant that thing.

51:48.820 --> 51:50.900
It means that she's into you and she wants you to-

51:50.900 --> 51:51.780
Why are you fucking-

51:51.780 --> 51:54.740
You're on the internet right now and you're fucking typing in a question

51:54.740 --> 51:58.900
when you could just be squeezing a bosom over and over again all day long.

52:00.340 --> 52:04.020
This girl in my science class put my hand on her breasts and she said,

52:04.020 --> 52:05.620
yeah, yeah, get in there.

52:05.620 --> 52:06.660
Get right in there.

52:06.660 --> 52:10.660
I want to be inside this kid's head where he's going, huh.

52:10.660 --> 52:11.940
I want to be inside his hand.

52:11.940 --> 52:13.460
I feel like this is indicative of something.

52:13.460 --> 52:14.260
I don't understand.

52:14.260 --> 52:15.780
She's just playing me hot and cold.

52:16.980 --> 52:22.420
She's like touching your wiener and you're like, I don't know.

52:22.420 --> 52:23.620
What does it all mean?

52:23.620 --> 52:24.180
What is this-

52:24.180 --> 52:27.300
Griffin, can you cut out the part where I said I wish I was inside the hand

52:27.300 --> 52:29.060
of the kid squeezing the high school girl's boob?

52:29.060 --> 52:32.660
No, no.

52:32.660 --> 52:34.100
But I will turn the volume up.

52:36.340 --> 52:36.820
Wait a minute.

52:36.820 --> 52:39.620
That's the opposite thing of the thing that I needed.

52:39.620 --> 52:42.340
When you heard that audio get pretty bad back there,

52:42.340 --> 52:46.740
that was that because I had to blast Justin.

52:46.740 --> 52:51.380
I want to say I'm not sure about the mental state of this girl

52:51.380 --> 52:54.500
when she needs a hand on her boobs so bad she just reaches out,

52:54.500 --> 52:58.660
grabs her wrist in the middle of fucking science class and just plants the hand.

52:58.660 --> 52:59.700
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

52:59.700 --> 53:01.140
Was this fucking science class?

53:01.140 --> 53:01.620
Because it makes-

53:01.620 --> 53:02.740
Oh, that explains everything.

53:03.380 --> 53:04.100
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

53:04.100 --> 53:08.740
So you're going to get some blood down in those parts, like engorging it.

53:10.900 --> 53:15.540
It's going to hit your pleasure nerves in your pleasure cortex.

53:15.540 --> 53:17.540
It's going to fire all your synapses.

53:18.100 --> 53:19.140
Is there a worse word?

53:19.140 --> 53:19.860
Than engorged?

53:19.860 --> 53:21.060
Engorged.

53:21.060 --> 53:21.940
I don't think so.

53:21.940 --> 53:23.460
What if I said engorged?

53:23.460 --> 53:29.140
Oh, God.

53:29.140 --> 53:30.660
How do I know if a girl likes me?

53:30.660 --> 53:34.900
Guys, I think something might be wrong with my ass.

53:34.900 --> 53:36.180
If you have one, there's something wrong.

53:36.180 --> 53:37.140
My ass is missing.

53:40.580 --> 53:42.100
It's a crime of the century.

53:42.100 --> 53:43.700
That pink panther got in there.

53:45.300 --> 53:46.260
What a rascal.

53:46.820 --> 53:47.700
What a rascal.

53:47.700 --> 53:48.820
Get out of there, you thief.

53:49.620 --> 53:51.460
Trix Rabbit got bored trying to get Trix.

53:51.460 --> 53:55.940
He stole my-

53:55.940 --> 53:58.020
Oh, I'm definitely going to miss one of them.

53:58.020 --> 53:58.260
Yep.

53:59.220 --> 54:00.500
I'm not catching all these-

54:00.500 --> 54:02.740
You gotta catch them all.

54:04.500 --> 54:06.980
That was actually the plot of my favorite Atari game.

54:06.980 --> 54:07.540
Catch all my-

54:07.540 --> 54:10.900
They would fall from above and you'd have a peach basket.

54:14.340 --> 54:14.900
Hey, listen.

54:14.900 --> 54:18.980
My wife is completing her teaching credentials for the state of California,

54:18.980 --> 54:21.460
and will begin teaching the second grade next week.

54:21.460 --> 54:23.540
It's her first time in the classroom of her own,

54:23.540 --> 54:25.060
and since we're both big fans of the show,

54:25.060 --> 54:29.060
I wonder if you have some excellent advice for her to make a good first impression on her students

54:29.060 --> 54:30.260
and kick the year off right.

54:30.260 --> 54:30.980
That's from Root.

54:31.540 --> 54:32.100
Kick a kid.

54:32.820 --> 54:33.940
Kick a kid right in the-

54:34.660 --> 54:35.780
Right into the chokey.

54:35.780 --> 54:36.020
Yeah.

54:36.820 --> 54:37.780
Then make him eat the cake.

54:37.780 --> 54:38.580
That's day two.

54:39.780 --> 54:41.940
I feel like that should be on every syllabus.

54:41.940 --> 54:43.780
Day one, I'm going to put one of you in the chokey.

54:43.780 --> 54:44.900
Don't let it be you.

54:44.900 --> 54:47.540
Day two, one of you is going to eat the whole cake.

54:47.540 --> 54:51.220
Can you hammer throw a child out the window for eating two M&Ms?

54:52.420 --> 54:53.220
Fire braids.

54:53.220 --> 54:53.940
Fire braids.

54:53.940 --> 54:54.580
Fire pigtails.

54:55.380 --> 54:58.980
God, there is one person out there who has not seen the hit film Matilda-

54:58.980 --> 55:00.740
What the fuck are they talking about?

55:01.380 --> 55:02.420
What are they on?

55:02.420 --> 55:05.460
But I love that in your mind, everyone else's scene is going,

55:05.460 --> 55:06.580
oh yeah, okay.

55:06.580 --> 55:08.580
That is just the fucking best movie.

55:08.580 --> 55:11.380
Any movie with Rusty Root's Send Me On My Way in the soundtrack

55:11.380 --> 55:12.820
is pretty much going to be a surefire hit.

55:12.820 --> 55:13.540
Really, Griffith?

55:13.540 --> 55:18.180
Because that also includes George of the Jungle with Brendan Fraser.

55:18.180 --> 55:21.300
That was Dr. Fraser's best work, if you ask me my opinion.

55:23.220 --> 55:25.860
Does he have an honorary letters degree from somewhere?

55:27.620 --> 55:31.140
I listened to that song last night during a night of rabble rousing

55:31.140 --> 55:36.900
and there is not anything better in music than the breakdown at the end of that song

55:36.900 --> 55:38.980
where the Rusty Root guy's like,

55:38.980 --> 55:44.100
like just fucking losing it.

55:44.100 --> 55:45.220
Sounds like a hippie ghost.

55:51.700 --> 55:54.900
Let's see, she's going to begin teaching the second grade.

55:55.780 --> 56:00.580
What did I like for my second grade to me is like the last one before it gets tough.

56:00.580 --> 56:01.140
Oh, shit gets rough.

56:01.140 --> 56:03.220
When you get third grade, you're going to get multiplication,

56:03.220 --> 56:07.060
division, and cursive if they're still breaking it down the way they used to.

56:07.060 --> 56:09.140
They're not doing cursive anymore.

56:09.140 --> 56:09.860
What?

56:09.860 --> 56:11.060
Yeah, they've stopped doing cursive.

56:11.620 --> 56:12.420
No, fuck you.

56:12.420 --> 56:13.140
Are you kidding?

56:13.140 --> 56:13.700
Shut up.

56:13.700 --> 56:14.580
Oh, I swear to God.

56:14.580 --> 56:16.420
You can't just stop doing cursive.

56:16.420 --> 56:19.140
You can't because all you got to do is teach a kid how to fucking sign his name.

56:20.020 --> 56:22.580
And then that's all that's all the letters that they're going to need to know.

56:22.580 --> 56:24.260
When do you use cursive except to like sign your-

56:24.260 --> 56:24.980
No joke, guys.

56:24.980 --> 56:26.580
When was the last time you wrote in cursive?

56:26.580 --> 56:28.580
Don't you have to use cursive when you write a check?

56:29.300 --> 56:30.500
That's no.

56:30.500 --> 56:30.980
What?

56:30.980 --> 56:32.500
No, that's what I've been doing.

56:32.500 --> 56:33.780
My bad, my bad.

56:33.780 --> 56:34.580
You don't do that.

56:34.580 --> 56:35.380
What the fuck?

56:35.380 --> 56:38.900
That's why it takes me forever to pay off my debts.

56:40.020 --> 56:41.860
Are you shitting me right now?

56:41.860 --> 56:42.820
Can we pause the sh-

56:42.820 --> 56:44.020
I thought that was the thing.

56:44.020 --> 56:45.060
I felt like that was the thing.

56:45.060 --> 56:48.660
Like you had to write the amount in cursive or something.

56:48.660 --> 56:50.100
Root, I'm very sorry.

56:50.100 --> 56:52.260
We cannot offer your wife any more practical advice

56:52.260 --> 56:54.740
because the rest of the episode is about this.

56:54.740 --> 56:55.620
What the fuck, Travis?

56:55.620 --> 56:57.780
What the fuck are you talking about?

56:57.780 --> 56:58.980
Clearly, I'm wrong.

56:58.980 --> 57:00.420
Clearly, I accept it.

57:00.420 --> 57:01.220
No, no, no, no, no.

57:01.220 --> 57:02.260
We're going to incept this.

57:02.260 --> 57:06.100
We're going to incept this. When did you start thinking

57:06.100 --> 57:07.620
the whole thing needed to be in cursive?

57:07.620 --> 57:10.340
I believe it was in fifth grade when we played the Game of Life.

57:10.340 --> 57:11.540
Or maybe it was sixth grade.

57:11.540 --> 57:13.140
Game of Life at Comac.

57:13.140 --> 57:15.620
And we got checkbooks and we had to fill out checks.

57:15.620 --> 57:18.580
And I believe I was told it had to be in cursive to count.

57:18.580 --> 57:19.940
And maybe that was just for the game,

57:19.940 --> 57:22.180
but that carried through the rest of my life.

57:22.180 --> 57:23.140
So you can do an-

57:23.140 --> 57:24.260
I'm actually, I flipped it.

57:24.260 --> 57:26.660
I'm a little jealous right now because if you asked me,

57:27.300 --> 57:28.260
I could maybe do,

57:28.260 --> 57:31.780
I'm going to say like 15 lowercase letters in cursive

57:31.780 --> 57:33.940
and like, no joke, eight uppercase.

57:33.940 --> 57:36.180
I can do the whole alphabet without thinking.

57:36.180 --> 57:37.060
Fuck off, man.

57:37.060 --> 57:38.420
That's so crazy to me.

57:38.420 --> 57:38.920
Like-

57:38.920 --> 57:41.140
Now, sometimes I have problems with the S's

57:41.140 --> 57:43.380
because that shit gets really tricky.

57:43.380 --> 57:45.940
How come the lowercase letters are so much easier than the-

57:45.940 --> 57:47.620
Like the lowercase letters seem pretty reasonable.

57:47.620 --> 57:51.300
Like an N is just like an M and an M is like an M with extra hump.

57:51.300 --> 57:52.500
Like I get all that.

57:52.500 --> 57:56.340
But once you get to uppercase, it's like when you make a Q,

57:56.340 --> 57:59.460
when you make a Q, you have to draw a tiny maze.

57:59.460 --> 58:00.020
Like-

58:00.020 --> 58:02.580
My favorite is things like it's a T

58:02.580 --> 58:04.500
and then you put a line through it and it's an F.

58:04.500 --> 58:07.380
Like those two letters are so far apart in the alphabet.

58:07.380 --> 58:09.300
And so it's like, oh, I can just make this an F

58:09.300 --> 58:10.260
and put a line on it.

58:11.060 --> 58:12.900
If you told me that you would kill my cat

58:12.900 --> 58:15.540
if I couldn't draw an uppercase cursive Z,

58:15.540 --> 58:16.980
I would just start digging a little hole.

58:18.900 --> 58:19.940
Because this is not going to happen.

58:21.300 --> 58:22.980
I'm fortunate enough to have a G in my name,

58:22.980 --> 58:24.740
which is a real tricky character.

58:24.740 --> 58:26.580
It's got like eight loops in it.

58:26.580 --> 58:27.620
It's got like a bunch of loops.

58:27.620 --> 58:29.380
And like, I sometimes I'll bust that out of parties

58:29.380 --> 58:33.540
because most people, they have erased the uppercase G from their mind

58:33.540 --> 58:35.940
so that they can remember lyrics to a rusted root song.

58:36.660 --> 58:38.100
Travis, can you do me a favor?

58:38.100 --> 58:42.660
Can you, without looking, write a cursive alphabet and scan it?

58:42.660 --> 58:44.820
Can you do that and put it up on the forums

58:44.820 --> 58:45.860
so people can see your talent?

58:45.860 --> 58:46.260
When you say-

58:46.260 --> 58:46.740
Because I don't believe you.

58:46.740 --> 58:47.700
When you say without looking,

58:47.700 --> 58:49.540
you mean like without looking on the internet?

58:49.540 --> 58:50.100
Without doing any research.

58:50.100 --> 58:51.620
Without looking at the paper.

58:51.620 --> 58:53.380
Yeah, without doing any research right now,

58:53.380 --> 58:55.300
and now, not like right this second,

58:55.300 --> 58:56.820
but as soon as the show's over, do that.

58:56.820 --> 58:58.340
Like write the whole cursive alphabet out.

58:58.340 --> 58:59.300
Yes, I will do this.

58:59.300 --> 59:01.220
And then scan it or something.

59:01.220 --> 59:02.260
I will do that.

59:02.260 --> 59:05.460
Put it up on maximumfun.org forums.

59:05.460 --> 59:06.100
I will do that.

59:06.100 --> 59:07.060
Blow everyone's minds.

59:07.060 --> 59:08.420
Jesus, Travis, you're killing me.

59:08.420 --> 59:10.180
Let's put this thing in park.

59:10.900 --> 59:13.140
Okay, I want to hear Griffin's last question.

59:13.140 --> 59:15.540
I'm kind of freaked out right now, but I do want to hear it.

59:16.260 --> 59:17.700
This has been my brother and brother and brother and me.

59:18.260 --> 59:23.220
As you heard, we live at maximumfun.org.

59:23.220 --> 59:24.820

59:30.500 --> 59:31.380

59:31.380 --> 59:34.820

59:35.940 --> 59:38.500

59:42.020 --> 59:43.940
There's Judge John Hodgman.

59:43.940 --> 59:45.860
There's our buddy, stop podcasting yourself.

59:46.820 --> 59:48.180

59:48.180 --> 59:50.580
We're on Twitter, if you like that.

59:50.580 --> 59:51.300
That's your jam.

59:51.300 --> 59:56.900
We're at M-B-A-M is our Twitter name.

59:57.700 --> 01:00:00.740
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:02.340
for the use of their song.

01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:04.660
It's a departure as our theme song

01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:07.620
from the album Putting the Days to Bed,

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:10.020
which I just assume that everybody's buy at this point

01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:11.700
because it's like the best album.

01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:12.500
Well, here's what you do.

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:15.780
You buy it, you listen to it, you delete it, you buy it again.

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:17.860
Yeah, just keep that cycle going.

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:20.340
You got to refresh because the MP3s, they get dusty.

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:22.820
They get dusty after about a week or so.

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:23.860
They'll start to wear out.

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:27.460
Hey, so we want to thank people who,

01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:28.980
we love it when people tweet about the show.

01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:31.300
They include the M-B-M-B-A-M hashtag

01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:33.620
to use the Twitter part launch.

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:37.940
Thanks to Jam Cully, Silly Will, Ham Doctors as always,

01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:40.900
Granny Danny, Dan Napolitano.

01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:44.420
Dan Napolitano.

01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:45.860
Yeah, I nailed it first time out.

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:46.980
Sure, why not?

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:52.980
Rory, Michelle, Doughty Game, James Gowdy,

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:56.740
everybody that has talked about us.

01:00:58.260 --> 01:00:59.620
We really do appreciate it.

01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:02.500
Nick, Leith, Nick Reith.

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:02.900
Sorry.

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:07.060
My favorite Twitter user is Mr. Face is my favorite.

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:10.100
I wish you wouldn't say these things to me.

01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:11.300
Sorry.

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:12.180
Wish you wouldn't do that.

01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:16.100
So just tweet about, you know, our show with some quotes

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:19.140
or do like some people do and just tweet

01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:21.860
about random things that are happening in their life.

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:23.700
Like when our buddy Mason, your face got stuck

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:26.820
in an elevator decided to keep us updated on that.

01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:27.780
I'm glad they got out.

01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:29.060
I appreciated that drama.

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.420
Pretty touch and go there for a while.

01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:33.220
It was pretty good.

01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:36.900
But also you should leave the M-B-A-M hashtag search up

01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:40.180
in your Twitter client of choice because it gets crazy.

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:41.140
It gets pretty wild.

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:42.180
Yeah.

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:44.340
Guys, thank you so much.

01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:45.540
Yeah, thank you as always.

01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:46.260
You guys are the best.

01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:48.180
Share it with a friend if you can.

01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:51.460
If you get a moment, just like show them our sampler.

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:53.220
Just get on YouTube and search M-B-A-M.

01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:54.900
It's like the first thing that comes up and just like

01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:56.580
show them that and maybe they'll like it.

01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:58.500
Maybe it'll be something you can talk about with them.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.500
And if you want to get a personal message

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:01.860
or a business message on this show,

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:07.540
make sure you go to maximumfund.org slash Jumbotron and check that out.

01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:08.500
And just get up on it.

01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:09.940
Thank you so much.

01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:11.220
All right.

01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:11.540
Hit it.

01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:13.140
Griffin.

01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:16.260
This final back to school Yahoo question was sent in by Jacob Locker.

01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:16.900
Thank you, Jacob.

01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:20.500
It's by Yahoo Answers user Vlad T who asks,

01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:24.420
will a horse poop out a wallet

01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:26.740
or will it get stuck somewhere in its digestive system?

01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:30.900
I'm Justin back in school.

01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:32.020
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:32.900
The horse is in school.

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:34.260
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:35.700
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:36.340
Kiss your dad.

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:37.140
I swear on the...

01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:42.100
Keep your heart.

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:42.900
Three stacks.

01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:43.940
Keep your heart.

01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:45.220
Hey, keep your heart.

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:46.100
Three stacks.

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:47.140
Keep your heart.

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:48.420
Man, these girls are smart.

01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:49.060
Three stacks.

01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:50.260
These girls are smart.

01:02:50.260 --> 01:03:08.820
Keep your heart, play your part.
