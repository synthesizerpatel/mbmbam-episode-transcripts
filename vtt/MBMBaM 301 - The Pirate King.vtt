00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:47.920
Hello everybody, welcome to One Brother, My Brother, and the Advice Show for the modern era.

00:47.920 --> 00:53.600
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, the real Travis McElroy.

00:53.600 --> 00:58.240
I'm your sweet, sweet baby brother, sweet-ass baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:58.240 --> 01:03.120
Now, I have never had any doubts about the validity of your identity, Travis.

01:03.120 --> 01:07.360
What did you feel the need to clarify that you were the real Travis McElroy?

01:07.360 --> 01:17.520
Well, Justin, I am a grade-A, stamped, approved, real, 100% American, verified by Twitter,

01:18.080 --> 01:24.000
Travis McElroy. My life has really turned a corner. I got that blue checkmark.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.160
Twitter has verified me. Everything's changed. Everything's changed.

01:30.160 --> 01:35.040
So, from the way I understand it, you literally woke up and it was like any other day.

01:35.840 --> 01:40.320
It was like any other day. Maybe you could tell me there's like a sweet smell in the air,

01:40.320 --> 01:43.520
the sweet smell of honeysuckles, and you're like, something's changed.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.120
The sun was a little brighter.

01:45.120 --> 01:45.760
Well, that's just the warming.

01:45.760 --> 01:49.120
The birds were a little just better.

01:49.120 --> 01:49.360
Okay.

01:49.360 --> 01:56.320
Okay. I think it's funny because there's been a big social media push recently.

01:56.320 --> 01:59.760
Travis, do you know any of the ringleaders of that who are trying to get you verified?

02:01.360 --> 02:03.680
The ringleaders at Change.org petition?

02:03.680 --> 02:08.480
That was Anna Giles. That was a huge part of it, I assume.

02:09.120 --> 02:14.880
But I also think it was just like my friends Kanye and Kim.

02:15.440 --> 02:18.560
A different Kanye and Kim. Not the famous ones.

02:18.560 --> 02:23.280
Kanye Mendelsohn, your friend that works at Twitter.

02:23.280 --> 02:25.040
Yeah. And he was pushing really hard.

02:25.680 --> 02:29.760
Dave helped me out. Just not a specific Dave, mind you.

02:29.760 --> 02:32.080
Just like the general idea of Dave.

02:32.080 --> 02:36.800
Yeah. I do just want to point out Twitter. Your verification process, it sounds really cool.

02:36.800 --> 02:39.840
Considering that it needed no feedback from Travis whatsoever.

02:39.840 --> 02:42.880
You're just like, yeah, that thug seems real. Click. Flipped it on.

02:42.880 --> 02:46.320
He's real. I know. This is what they do. They go around in a circle.

02:46.320 --> 02:50.160
They say, you know Travis? And somebody says, oh, I know Travis. He's real as hell.

02:50.160 --> 02:53.840
And I don't want to bite the hand that feeds me here because I'm very excited to be verified.

02:53.840 --> 02:59.760
But I didn't receive an email or a notification or even like a tweet from Twitter.

02:59.760 --> 03:02.880
What would be the utility of telling you that you're Travis McElroy?

03:02.880 --> 03:08.800
I guess that's true. But like, I only found it out because somebody who like follows all

03:08.800 --> 03:12.720
verified accounts was like, congratulations on your verification. I was like, oh, what?

03:12.720 --> 03:18.240
Cool. Cool. Awesome. I had a huge, like, I was going to throw a party. I was going to make a

03:18.240 --> 03:22.160
banner. I was going to do a big champagne toast. And that was all taken away from me because I

03:22.160 --> 03:27.760
didn't get any forward knowledge of it. By the official Wendy's Twitter account.

03:27.760 --> 03:32.880
It was like, what's up Travis? Welcome to the club. Welcome to the squad. Free Wendy's for life.

03:32.880 --> 03:37.600
The confidence that I've gained alone, not to mention like the immense amount

03:37.600 --> 03:42.400
of power and benefits that come from being verified, but the confidence alone has been

03:42.400 --> 03:48.720
a game changer. You become a sort of vessel for the hopes and dreams of people.

03:49.200 --> 03:54.880
Yeah. You are the orphan Annie of us. You are like, the sun will come out tomorrow

03:54.880 --> 03:59.760
because I have a blue check mark. I'm like a folk hero of Twitter because they're like,

03:59.760 --> 04:04.960
he's not one of the rich ones. He's not a tastemaker. He's not a powerful person.

04:04.960 --> 04:10.000
And yet he is still verified. How did he get there? Is he a journalist? Does he work for

04:10.000 --> 04:15.200
some big company? No. He talks into a microphone seven days a week because he's a dummy.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.840
Travis is an inspiring reminder that literally

04:19.680 --> 04:27.120
anybody. Any old jag. Anyone. Anybody. Any fool. Anybody with like two brain cells to rub together

04:28.080 --> 04:32.160
can get verified. Now Travis, you give me the confidence I need to pursue my

04:32.160 --> 04:38.240
I live stream. Now that I've seen you accomplish yours with ease, you're going to see me accomplish

04:38.240 --> 04:44.000
my life stream, which is to destroy Twitter from the inside out to eat away at it from inside.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.240
Like a, like a disease. We have a lot of people who work at the trades listening to this podcast

04:48.240 --> 04:53.440
right now. What can we expect from Travis's new checkmark to Twitter account? What can we expect?

04:53.440 --> 05:00.080
Maybe like more, um, like brand evangelism, some, some advertorials for like craft macaroni and

05:00.080 --> 05:04.240
cheese. I've already been talking about Kroger. I've been talking about Nylabone. They're,

05:04.240 --> 05:08.480
they're followers of mine. I'm not going to take my foot off the gas as far as weird,

05:08.480 --> 05:13.840
funny tweets at 1159 just before I fall asleep will go. You're going to see like three,

05:13.840 --> 05:18.560
four times what I've already been doing. Nylabone is launching a men's fashion line

05:18.560 --> 05:22.480
and they're having a hard time getting that ball rolling down the old Hill.

05:22.480 --> 05:28.640
But here comes Travis and he's wearing a Nylabone Dickie, which is their sort of their flagship

05:28.640 --> 05:33.280
product. Um, and he looks fucking great. And you, you don't know whether or not to trust this,

05:33.280 --> 05:38.000
this Nylabone, um, shill, but then you look at that blue checkmark and everything's okay.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.520
So Travis, do you think when you tweeted serious question,

05:42.160 --> 05:46.320
shouldn't it be games of throne? You think people at Twitter were like, yes,

05:46.320 --> 05:51.760
we've done a great job on that one. This is a taste like a good work here.

05:52.320 --> 05:55.920
This is a, this has been Travis's tweet review. Let's just actually do it. Justin,

05:55.920 --> 06:00.720
if you and I want to do a comprehensive audit real quick, um, just see what, uh,

06:00.720 --> 06:05.040
verified Travis is up to. I know I've, I've been a little bit on fire for the last couple of days.

06:05.040 --> 06:09.840
So you go right ahead. I'm pretty proud of some. A lot of tweets about Gallivant on ABC. Lots of,

06:09.840 --> 06:15.040
wow, lots of, wow, lots of, wow, lots of, wow, lots of tweets about Gallivant, Travis.

06:15.920 --> 06:20.880
You're one shot shop. It's a little bit up in the air Griffin and I, uh, I'm unpaid,

06:20.880 --> 06:26.880
a huge proponent of Gallivant. I want people to watch it. I want people to go on Twitter,

06:26.880 --> 06:31.280
tweet at ABC and say, Hey, more Gallivant, please. Thank you very much.

06:31.280 --> 06:36.640
I do appreciate you, uh, tweeting with Ashley Burgess and Anthony Carboni about how great

06:36.640 --> 06:41.040
monster factory is. I'm trying to get that word out. I want to use my power and influence to build

06:41.040 --> 06:46.240
up my tiny, tiny brother's careers. You know what I mean? Do you feel an impetus, Travis? Now that

06:46.240 --> 06:51.280
you're the real Travis McElroy, do you think that that may be as a point of meditation for you,

06:52.000 --> 06:57.360
that like you always have to be bringing it real, 100% no games.

06:57.360 --> 07:01.120
You know, it's actually the opposite, Justin. Cause I remember being in college and trying

07:01.120 --> 07:05.920
to figure out who I was and I was like, what, what are the things I like versus the things

07:05.920 --> 07:10.800
I think I like? Cause other people like it. And now Twitter has basically said, you are you don't

07:10.800 --> 07:17.120
worry about it anymore. So now they've kind of let me off the chain because I know now I am

07:17.120 --> 07:22.240
Travis McElroy. I have self-actualized you. Yes. I am the most Travis McElroy I could be.

07:22.240 --> 07:28.000
Everything I'm doing is right. I never, in fact, I should be doing more of what I'm already doing.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.120
There's, um, I want to dive into just a subject that's important to me real fast, if I can. I know

07:33.120 --> 07:36.800
this has been a very Travis centric intro, but I'd like to talk just more broadly about the whole

07:36.800 --> 07:42.240
sort of McElroy universe. Um, you tweeted on April 29th post verification, I'm assuming. Um,

07:42.240 --> 07:46.320
there's no subject I am more afraid to talk about on Twitter than at Scott Bakula. His fans can be

07:46.320 --> 07:53.120
very intimidating. And then you got a response, um, from, and I don't think we should say her,

07:53.120 --> 07:57.920
her, her handle. Cause I don't want to say she has known in the community. She, this,

07:57.920 --> 08:02.320
this user said, that's because they are more intelligent than you. Uh, which you retweeted,

08:02.320 --> 08:07.680
which like, I guess is fine. Um, and I looked and I realized that I had this person blocked.

08:07.680 --> 08:11.920
And I realized this because I've tweeted about Scott Bakula before and this person has come down

08:11.920 --> 08:18.880
on me like a flock, like a murder of crows. It's amazing. It's amazing. If you, if you mentioned

08:18.880 --> 08:25.040
Scott Bakula, this person will respond. Is it a bot? Is it a bot? This, this fucking Scott Bakula

08:25.040 --> 08:32.560
Kingsguard? No, because they drop in out of nowhere and they will put you on blast and it's

08:32.560 --> 08:37.840
been like a specific blast. Like even if you're like Scott Bakula is the most amazing actor on

08:37.840 --> 08:41.760
the planet. I love him so much. They'll come back like, fuck you. You have no idea what you're

08:41.760 --> 08:46.560
talking about. You're like, cool, cool, cool. This is like highly targeted. No, it is like,

08:47.120 --> 08:52.640
no, it is highly targeted. I know that it's real because when I tweeted that thing about

08:52.640 --> 08:57.840
being intimidated by the fans, a bunch of people responded, don't listen to blank. They are the

08:57.840 --> 09:04.000
worst. Even we in the community don't like them. So like, this is just an outlier, rogue Scott

09:04.000 --> 09:09.040
Bakula fan. Don't track this person down and tweet at them, by the way. I do not want them to change

09:09.040 --> 09:13.280
this game. I love this game. I'm sad. I blocked them. I'm going to unblock them right now,

09:13.280 --> 09:18.720
honestly. Yeah. That's why I retweeted it. Cause I actually, I respect the avarice. I respect the

09:18.720 --> 09:26.640
community. Can the three of us adopt the highway, so to speak, and each pick a celeb and then just

09:26.640 --> 09:31.600
follow, like add a column on tweet deck. Anytime fucking anybody talks about them,

09:31.600 --> 09:36.880
we swoop in like Batman, like, hey moron. And just like give it to them raw.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.440
I think somebody said we're idiot. Like somebody said, why won't you go on, they tweeted at Scott

09:43.440 --> 09:47.120
to say, why won't you go on the show? Still, please don't do that again. Thanks. Thank you,

09:47.120 --> 09:51.600
please. Had a lot of that. Had a lot of that after the last episode. Thanks gang. Love your

09:51.600 --> 09:57.120
fervor, but let's bottle that one, that particular channel of it up. We have channels and we've got

09:57.120 --> 10:02.640
people to contact. Thank you very much. None of them will work, mind you. Someone swooped on them

10:02.640 --> 10:07.600
and said, it's because they're idiot man children. It's like, whoa, he just came out of nowhere.

10:08.560 --> 10:13.520
All right. Let's pick them. Let's pick them. Let's do a quick draft for our adopt the highway

10:13.520 --> 10:17.440
project. This is tough. I know it's really tough. It can't be somebody. It can't be like fucking

10:17.440 --> 10:22.480
Brad Pitt. Cause that's your, that's your, that's your whole life. And it can't be anybody. I was

10:22.480 --> 10:26.000
gonna say like a David Tennant, but I feel like there's too busy too big. Are you kidding me on

10:26.000 --> 10:29.840
the fucking internet? That's where David Tennant, David Tennant basically lives on the internet.

10:29.840 --> 10:35.040
He's basically like that movie transcendence. Should we pick other Huntingtonians? Should we

10:35.040 --> 10:40.080
do this for like Brad Dora for Michael Surfer? It's like where we get, if somebody tweets,

10:40.080 --> 10:49.120
we can defend them. Like how dare you? Um, I like that. I like locking down the H H town game. I've

10:49.120 --> 10:53.600
met Michael service and I would feel weird. Like, cause if I ever see him again, he'll be like,

10:53.600 --> 10:58.160
Oh, you're my weird Twitter Kings guard. And I'll have to be like, yeah, that's that's me. I'm

10:58.160 --> 11:02.560
sorry. It seemed like you, I thought you liked it and wanted it. I've got mine. I've got mine. Okay.

11:02.560 --> 11:09.840
Hit it. Carry OS. Oh yeah. I think you're going to have a little bit of competition on that

11:09.840 --> 11:13.920
for if you want to be the person that leaps to his defense, but I feel pretty confident. I'm a

11:13.920 --> 11:21.120
big fan. Yeah. Yes. I feel like you say the name, people know the name. He's got name recognition,

11:21.120 --> 11:26.800
but I don't feel like there's already like a lot. I, okay. I would have some competition,

11:26.800 --> 11:31.280
but I think I could nudge my way to the front. Thanks to a little blue check mark.

11:33.040 --> 11:39.120
Why is this verified person so defensive of me? Yeah. That's what I'm saying, Justin. I'm getting

11:39.120 --> 11:45.280
through every filter on the planet. All right, Travis, I haven't until now, but I am to see if

11:45.280 --> 11:49.600
you actually follow through this. I am going to start following you just to see if you actually

11:49.600 --> 11:54.000
make good on this. I'm glad that I finally earned your follow. Okay. Listen, this is an advice.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.760
Hold on. You don't want to know who I picked. Yeah. Who do you pick, Griffin? I'm putting up

11:57.760 --> 12:02.560
my tweet announcement of who I picked right now, but I've decided to just go ahead and do Scott

12:02.560 --> 12:12.160
Bakula because here's the thing. This mean, mean, mean woman is doing a poor job. She's got a fucking

12:12.160 --> 12:16.000
itchy trigger finger. I feel like this is more indicative of her wanting to say mean things to

12:16.000 --> 12:21.760
people on the internet and Scott Bakula is just like the vehicle, the hearty Tostito chip that

12:21.760 --> 12:28.480
carries her hate salsa. I don't, I don't play that shit. He needs a better, he needs a better class

12:28.480 --> 12:35.440
of defender. You know what I mean? Yeah, I think that that's an excellent choice. Okay,

12:35.440 --> 12:39.440
this is an advice show. Justin, you're not going to pick one? You're just going to skirt the whole

12:39.440 --> 12:45.120
discussion? I don't want to commit myself to it because then I don't want people tweeting about

12:45.120 --> 12:51.840
me saying like, Hey, your boy Peter Stormare is under fire again. Maybe you need to like get in

12:51.840 --> 12:56.000
there and help, help take him down. Well, I think you just threw your hat over the fence. I think

12:56.000 --> 13:03.600
you just, here's the three. Okay, listen, listen, I'm just going to say this real quick. There is

13:03.600 --> 13:10.080
an at Brad Dourif Twitter account. It has three tweets. They're from 2009 and 2010 respectively.

13:10.960 --> 13:16.000
These are the tweets I gave Mr. Dorf's rep the info Twitter balls in his court. Now next week,

13:16.000 --> 13:20.320
Mr. Dorf is still not using this Twitter account. Sad music. I thought he has publicist would use

13:20.320 --> 13:26.320
it for updates someday. Third tweet looks around, takes a broom, sweeps out dusting cobwebs.

13:26.320 --> 13:29.280
This place feels a little empty. Only one person could make this place.

13:32.880 --> 13:40.800
It's so good. It's so good. He set up a little like Brad Dorf, a exoskeleton,

13:40.800 --> 13:51.760
and they're just waiting for him to hop inside and take control. Oh man. Okay. I literally just

13:51.760 --> 13:55.520
added a Scott back to the column on tweet deck and I'm going to be watching it during the show

13:55.520 --> 14:00.720
just for any fucking anybody who steps because here's the thing. I feel like we need this is

14:00.720 --> 14:04.880
volume two now, right? We need new segments and I feel like we should endeavor everything that

14:04.880 --> 14:10.000
we do. Every question that we do, we just like, we, we, we try to make a segment out of it and

14:10.000 --> 14:15.040
maybe a new segment is like Baccala defense force. I'm, I'm tweeting right now about my love of

14:15.040 --> 14:18.720
carryaways. All right. Well, let's maybe let's, we should all close Twitter and do some advice.

14:19.360 --> 14:24.000
Yeah. I think that that sounds good to me. I'll pick somebody at Peter storm air seems good.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.360
Like, but I don't think Peter streamer needs me. You know what I mean? Not like Scott,

14:27.360 --> 14:32.640
not like Scott. Baccala needs me. Has to have me, has to all Griffin. I must have him while taking

14:32.640 --> 14:38.000
a small road trip to Chicago with my girlfriend. We pulled off into a rest stop to switch off

14:38.000 --> 14:43.040
driving while there. I decided to buy a bottle of water from a vending machine. To my surprise,

14:43.040 --> 14:47.280
there was a cold bottle of water in the bottom of the vending machine. Just sitting there.

14:48.320 --> 14:51.760
I took the water, but now that I have it, I'm afraid it could be poisoned.

14:52.480 --> 14:57.520
Should I trust this mysterious bottle of water from a dirty old Indiana rest stop or throw it

14:57.520 --> 15:03.760
out the goddamn window? That's from water weary water. I cannot imagine that they are still

15:03.760 --> 15:10.720
waiting on an answer to this question. Yeah. Travis sent this email 14 hours ago. So, um,

15:12.240 --> 15:16.240
okay. What would you guys do in this, in this scenario? I don't think I'd drink it.

15:17.520 --> 15:24.880
Oh, I don't know. I think I would. I think that if I was like, oh, I'm going to pay a dollar 75

15:24.880 --> 15:32.640
or whatever for the sunny and then there in the trays, the dishonest would be like, oh, swoop.

15:32.640 --> 15:41.200
Um, I feel like, I feel like a true adulthood or maybe it's not even an adulthood, but like you,

15:41.200 --> 15:47.920
you reach a point in your life of financial stability where the 0.0001% chance that you'll

15:47.920 --> 15:53.520
drink something that will kill you no longer becomes worth saving a dollar. Yeah, but like

15:53.520 --> 15:59.360
that doesn't like, okay. It just doesn't make sense to me that if you're going to go through

15:59.360 --> 16:06.080
the trouble of poisoning something, why would you set a honey pot by which like the person probably

16:06.080 --> 16:11.760
would be inclined not to drink it? You know what I mean? Like if you wanted to put a poison bottle

16:11.760 --> 16:17.600
of water somewhere, it seems like you would put it in a, a refrigerator at like a speedway or

16:17.600 --> 16:23.280
something, something that people would actually like drink. Not like you're not, why are you just

16:23.280 --> 16:29.040
trying to poison people? You're thinking too much about like the physical poisoning.

16:29.040 --> 16:35.440
What about like a curse or? Yeah, the curse is what I was thinking of also. Yeah, something

16:35.440 --> 16:41.920
more along the lines of like, they have not physically altered the makeup of this Dasani at

16:41.920 --> 16:48.640
all, except if you're the one who takes it, maybe you'll be thirsty forever. Well, we are all going

16:48.640 --> 16:54.880
to be thirsty for like, that's, I hope. No, I mean like no amount of liquid, no amount of beverage

16:54.880 --> 16:59.600
could. Unslakeable. Yeah, unslakeable, thank you. That would be the name of the movie,

16:59.600 --> 17:04.480
Unslakeable. Unslakeable. I'm glad that we've pivoted away from poisoning advice,

17:04.480 --> 17:09.120
which is what we were, oh boys, we were really dangerously teetering on the edge of becoming

17:09.760 --> 17:16.080
a poison. Let me tell you how I'd kill a stranger at a speedway. How to get away with cursing water.

17:16.640 --> 17:22.640
I bet if you could market cursed water, it would sell really fucking well. I don't know why you

17:22.640 --> 17:28.480
would curse. Okay, the thing about a curse is that in order for it to work, there has to be

17:29.200 --> 17:31.520
a sort of like- A sacrifice.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.760
Like an irony behind- Oh, I see.

17:36.320 --> 17:39.920
You have to, there's a re, okay, if you take a bottle of water out of the vending machine that's

17:39.920 --> 17:42.960
already in the vending machine and you don't pay your money, you're just like doing what's best

17:42.960 --> 17:46.880
for the environment. You're not throwing that in a landfill. Why should you be punished for that?

17:46.880 --> 17:55.680
You know what I mean? Like if there was a table and on it said like, for service dogs only,

17:55.680 --> 17:59.600
and you went over and just like drained it, right? Then I could see where you would be

17:59.600 --> 18:04.720
punished for that karmically. Yes. And you'd wake up being a service dog the next day.

18:04.720 --> 18:07.840
You'd wake up as a service dog, Shaggy, D.A.

18:07.840 --> 18:13.440
And then like the evil wizard would show up and say, I said it was for service dogs only.

18:13.440 --> 18:18.800
And then Tim Allen's like, Tim Allen's like, when the fuck am I going to learn my lesson?

18:18.800 --> 18:25.200
When am I going to learn my lesson? I've got to dial it in. I know I'm going to eat this cursed

18:25.200 --> 18:29.920
milk and cookies. Ah, shit. Santa Claus four, dog to Santa, kick flip.

18:30.640 --> 18:33.680
Santa paw, wait, that's already a thing. Santa paws two.

18:33.680 --> 18:38.400
It's like that time when he's, you know how the first one starts with Santa dying

18:38.400 --> 18:41.360
and Tim Allen stealing his clothes out of Chili?

18:41.360 --> 18:45.360
And then he's like, oh, I like these boots. And it's like, oh, God, I think I'll take these for

18:45.360 --> 18:52.240
myself. I didn't think that the scene of Tim Allen stripping Santa's corpse needed to last for 10

18:52.240 --> 18:57.840
minutes. Yeah, but it was like bold. And two of those minutes were just a close up on his

18:58.480 --> 19:03.760
slowly engorging hog. Yeah, it's his wild hog.

19:05.120 --> 19:10.320
It starts off- The long, long scene of him digging a shallow grave in his backyard as he

19:10.320 --> 19:15.040
laughed covered in blood was, I didn't think it was appropriate for a kid's movie, but no one

19:15.040 --> 19:19.520
mentioned it in any of their critiques. And his hog just fluctuated between different

19:19.520 --> 19:21.920
states of firmness. As he laughed.

19:21.920 --> 19:24.160
As he laughed. It was like, ha, ha, ha.

19:24.160 --> 19:27.520
But then he got really chubby and grew a big beard.

19:28.800 --> 19:33.200
And then we all had raging hogs. I think your problem was going to drink water anyway.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.840
What's water going to do? Nothing. Yeah, that's it. If I'm going to try and poison

19:35.840 --> 19:39.840
a fool with a vending machine honey pot, you know I'm going to put some fruitopia down there

19:39.840 --> 19:43.520
and not some water. Because even if you walk up to that machine expecting to-

19:43.520 --> 19:47.040
Even if you walk up to that machine expecting to get some water and you see a free fruitopia

19:47.040 --> 19:51.120
waiting for you, my plans have just shifted in a wonderful new direction.

19:51.760 --> 19:55.280
Like that HEB water you like so much, Griffin. What if they put that down there?

19:55.280 --> 19:58.880
I've recently learned that it's being discontinued and I really don't want to fucking get into it

19:58.880 --> 20:00.400
right now. Okay, sorry.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.600
Do you guys want a Yahoo? I'd like that. Thank you.

20:03.600 --> 20:07.520
This Yahoo was sent in by Aaron Keys. By the way, is there anything in that question

20:07.520 --> 20:10.720
that we could turn into a new segment? Maybe like Travis's Curses or...

20:11.920 --> 20:16.480
No. Aaron Keys sent this in. Thank you, Aaron. It's by Yahoo Answers user Darius who asks,

20:18.320 --> 20:24.240
I want to be an explosive dunker, but I'm skinny and can do a basic two-hand dunk.

20:24.240 --> 20:34.560
I'm 6'6 already and 16. I want to be able to catch oops, which is I believe a shorthand for

20:34.560 --> 20:39.520
or hoops jams. I think it's short for Alex Oops.

20:41.360 --> 20:44.960
That would be a great basketball name. You know how basketball players when they get super,

20:44.960 --> 20:49.120
super famous, they can change their name to cool sounding shit like Larry Bird?

20:49.760 --> 20:51.760
You think that was really his name? Because he flies like a bird.

20:51.760 --> 20:54.080
Because he flies like a bird when he puts those dunks in the rim.

20:56.640 --> 21:01.120
Explosive dunks, a little on the skinny side. I don't think that matters so much.

21:01.120 --> 21:04.720
You got the 6'6. But he's got the height. You got the height is going to be good.

21:08.560 --> 21:12.640
How can you learn to catch oops? Because I've always thought of that as being like sort of

21:13.280 --> 21:22.640
bred into a child. What you need is you need a oops partner who is both taller and better at

21:22.640 --> 21:30.720
basketball than you. Yeah, I guess that's a good point, Travis. A good oops is like a

21:30.720 --> 21:36.880
contract of trust between two people. And ideally what you want is for them to already

21:36.880 --> 21:44.240
be making the shot and you're just barely touching the ball and then you take all the credit.

21:44.880 --> 21:48.480
I was the scorekeeper. You received a trophy for that, didn't you?

21:48.480 --> 21:50.320
A trophy for that and everything. Yeah.

21:51.040 --> 21:55.040
And so what did you learn from your time watching the people on the paint?

21:55.040 --> 22:00.000
If I dunk every day, then I only know how I dunk. As the scorekeeper, the scorekeeper might

22:00.000 --> 22:04.480
arguably be the best basketball player on the whole court because they have to watch like a hawk and

22:04.480 --> 22:09.040
see every dunk that everybody does. That's why I try to tell people that I was the best one out

22:09.040 --> 22:14.480
there. And you spent 10,000 hours as the scorekeeper, right? So you became like a basketball

22:14.480 --> 22:20.800
expert. Sort of a basketball expert. You know, I got so into that groove. I tried to join the

22:20.800 --> 22:28.480
wrestling team as a manager and it was me. And at the time to sign up for it, it was me and

22:28.480 --> 22:35.360
seven girls. And one of the girls said that that job was only for girls and that I could

22:35.360 --> 22:37.760
join the wrestling team. Wow. Sexism is alive in America.

22:37.760 --> 22:39.520
I know, right? Finally.

22:39.520 --> 22:41.840
This fucking fox catcher too.

22:42.560 --> 22:48.880
Yeah. I was told that because of my gender, I was not going to fill that role. And I was like,

22:48.880 --> 22:54.640
I get it. For too long, men have suffered under the thumb of the matriarchy.

22:54.640 --> 22:58.720
Right. So when people talk about like the glass ceiling, for example,

22:58.720 --> 23:03.520
and they say it's something that affects women in my head, I usually amend that to say just

23:03.520 --> 23:09.040
women and Justin. Also, Willy Wonka shattered the glass ceiling with the Wonka Vader. I saw it.

23:09.040 --> 23:10.080
Sorry, ladies. Sorry.

23:10.080 --> 23:11.760
He destroyed sexism forever.

23:11.760 --> 23:19.360
He destroyed sexism forever. He and Charlie. I don't know why naming another white man as his

23:19.360 --> 23:24.880
successor shattered the glass ceiling, but I saw it in all of its technicolor glory.

23:24.880 --> 23:27.040
I think he just replaced the glass ceiling with a glass elevator,

23:27.040 --> 23:31.360
which is basically a little glass prison, which is arguably much, much worse. Explosive dunks.

23:32.640 --> 23:36.400
Oh, guys. I had some bad old chili last night. Explosive dunks.

23:37.440 --> 23:42.480
Oh, it's all raw down there. I think it's not about your size. It's about, it's not about,

23:43.440 --> 23:47.680
it's not about the player and the pain. It's about the heart in the player.

23:47.680 --> 23:52.560
You're on some Michael's Secret stuff shit right now. I want to give this person practical

23:52.560 --> 23:58.480
explosive dunk advice. An explosive dunk, I think you would define going from zero on the floor,

23:59.280 --> 24:06.000
you don't even have the basketball in your hands, to up in the fucking paint hoop from how fast you

24:06.000 --> 24:11.280
can get up there and how scary you can be while you do it. It's an intimidation game, the explosive

24:11.280 --> 24:13.920
dunks. I'm sick of this- But I think it's all a mental game,

24:13.920 --> 24:18.800
Griffin. That's what I'm saying. You have to yell something out while you dunk. And

24:18.800 --> 24:22.960
the first couple of times, maybe the first hundred times, you're going to yell something

24:22.960 --> 24:29.600
and then the dunk won't happen and you'll look really foolish. But on the 100th and one time,

24:29.600 --> 24:35.520
when you yell like, dunkums, and you do it and you nail it, everyone's going to be like, damn.

24:35.520 --> 24:37.520
Damn dunkums, dude. Damn, Daniel.

24:37.520 --> 24:41.360
See, I'm not interested in yelling something when I'm on the court going for a sick dunk.

24:41.360 --> 24:48.880
When I go for a nasty dunk, what I want to be remembered for by my fellow players,

24:48.880 --> 24:53.520
I don't want to be remembered for my dunking ability. I want to be remembered for my kind

24:53.520 --> 24:59.920
and generous heart. So before I go for a dunk, I normally say something quietly so that only my

24:59.920 --> 25:07.520
fellow players can hear me, but in a conciliatory considerate thing to say before a dunk. So if I'm

25:07.520 --> 25:17.120
going up off the paint, elevator, magic man, go for two, the sickest two, I look at another player

25:17.120 --> 25:24.480
and I'll say something like, next time it'll be you, and then I'll go for it. Or like, nothing

25:24.480 --> 25:30.000
personal, and then I'll take it down there. Or like, you know what I mean? You have a lovely

25:30.000 --> 25:35.520
family. Yeah, exactly, exactly. Hey, your shoes are untied. But only if their shoes,

25:35.520 --> 25:42.160
I can't say this enough, are untied. Because it's not a prank, okay? I'll salute your shorts here.

25:42.160 --> 25:46.400
Yeah. We're trying to play basketball, gentlemen. What if you, every time you dunk,

25:47.520 --> 25:54.720
apologize to everybody on the team? Because I think if I ever joined a basketball outfit

25:56.080 --> 26:03.360
and I saw one of my co-dunkers get a dunk instead of me, I'd be like, I wish I was the one getting

26:03.360 --> 26:07.600
up in the paint and dunking. So like, what if every time you dunked you'd be like, I know you

26:07.600 --> 26:12.640
guys wish this was you, but it's me this time, and next time maybe the next time it'll be you.

26:12.640 --> 26:18.000
You know what I found helps with that, Griffin? If I'm running up to take it downtown, like if I'm

26:18.000 --> 26:25.040
about to nasty dunk, as I'm passing one of my fellow players, I'll say like, boost me, boost

26:25.040 --> 26:31.520
me, boost me! So they'll get a hand on me and kind of like help lift me. So when I do the dunk,

26:31.520 --> 26:35.360
they're not clear. In their head, they kind of feel like, I don't know if he would have made it

26:35.920 --> 26:41.760
by himself. I would have. Yeah. But you know, I feel like that gets them involved. You know,

26:41.760 --> 26:47.600
it's like fun for them. Michael Jordan did that to keep his relationship good with Larry Bird,

26:47.600 --> 26:53.040
because Larry Bird's a very jealous man. Holy shit. And like every dunk that anybody gets,

26:53.040 --> 26:57.280
even in the games he doesn't play, he can't even watch basketball on TV anymore because he sees

26:57.280 --> 27:00.640
all these dunks happening. He's like, that should have been mine. And it's like, you don't even play

27:00.640 --> 27:08.240
for the Charlotte Hornets. You could also act as though you're acting on, you could shout them out

27:08.240 --> 27:12.800
as you're going for the dunk. So sort of like, as you're going up in the air, you're just like,

27:12.800 --> 27:17.680
Vladi Divac taught me how to do this! Yeah. And then Vladi Divac's like, hell yeah. Thank you.

27:17.680 --> 27:23.040
Thank you for the credit. Thank you. I think every time you dunk, because I've never done it,

27:23.040 --> 27:26.400
and I imagine it's like the hardest, it's the hardest thing in the world, right? Dunking,

27:26.400 --> 27:29.280
it's the hardest, it's the hardest feat in sports. A lot of people say pitch in a perfect game. Why

27:29.280 --> 27:33.600
don't you get bonus points for dunking? Exactly. Yeah. It's worth a paltry amount of points,

27:33.600 --> 27:37.920
but it's the thing everybody goes to the shit for the shit. I think you should get points for

27:37.920 --> 27:42.400
fighting and hockey too, but that's a whole nother kettle of fish. I think every time you dunk,

27:42.400 --> 27:47.680
you should be able to give an Oscar-style acceptance speech immediately afterwards.

27:47.680 --> 27:52.000
Like immediately just pause the game for like, it doesn't have to be very long, like 20 seconds.

27:52.000 --> 27:59.120
And just be like, for this dunk, I just want to say huge ups to the Space Jam soundtrack. Spent a

27:59.120 --> 28:06.720
lot of hard days in the old asphalt jungle learning the ropes to the songs from R. Kelly.

28:06.720 --> 28:09.600
And oh, it's over, right? Back into the regulation time. I think the problem with that-

28:09.600 --> 28:13.040
Larry, I know you're watching. This one's- Larry, I know you're watching. Just fucking

28:13.040 --> 28:18.320
cool it, dude. Stop calling my house at night. Stop with the tweets. Travis is getting exhausted.

28:18.320 --> 28:24.640
I think the problem with that rule, they used to have that. You guys are too young to remember.

28:24.640 --> 28:29.520
They used to have that. But the problem is you have players who started telling very interesting

28:29.520 --> 28:35.280
stories in 20-second chunks. So at the end of it, they'd be like, and if you want to hear how this

28:35.280 --> 28:39.760
one wraps up, if you want to hear how it got out of this grape, then you'll just have to let me

28:39.760 --> 28:44.000
dunk again. And they had a big problem with players like, everybody back, back, back, back, back, back.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.760
I gotta hear this. I gotta hear this. Larry Bird, get up. I gotta know what happened to that chicken.

28:48.400 --> 28:54.480
Yeah. So where did the car end up? I think that when you dunk, not only should your team

28:54.480 --> 28:58.160
get two points, the other team should lose two points. Oh, that's really good.

28:58.880 --> 29:02.880
Because really, that's what a dunk signifies. Like, I am dunking on you.

29:03.520 --> 29:07.920
What if- Like, not like I shot a basket and made it. Like, this dunk is to embarrass you.

29:07.920 --> 29:15.360
Yeah. What if dunking was like the golden snitch of basketball, and the first team that does it

29:15.360 --> 29:24.000
gets 150 points. And the game's over. And the game's immediately over. And to sort of make it

29:24.000 --> 29:29.280
a little bit harder to do, we're gonna raise that hoop up like 10 more feet, huh? Let's get that hoop-

29:29.280 --> 29:32.800
And then everybody has to lift you up, and everybody's dunking together.

29:32.800 --> 29:37.600
That's what I'm saying, bro. I'm talking about full-blown cheerleader pyramid to get- I bet,

29:37.600 --> 29:42.560
but see, then you start getting folks like, I mean, Dikembe Mutombo doesn't need as many folks

29:42.560 --> 29:47.520
helping him up. You know what I mean? And so like, Yao Ming is finally like, you know, he's not the

29:47.520 --> 29:51.280
best shooter in the league, but I mean, he's gonna, he's the fucking Harry Potter of snitch dunking.

29:51.280 --> 29:57.360
If you want to instantly improve basketball, start playing the game with a water balloon

29:57.360 --> 30:01.840
shaped like a basketball, because what is that gonna lead to? No dribbles. Thank you.

30:01.840 --> 30:04.960
Yeah. Soft passes. Absolutely. One dunk,

30:04.960 --> 30:06.400
and the game's over. Yeah.

30:06.400 --> 30:09.600
And it's like such an explosive finish. That's it. That's the end of the game.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.080
What if it's a Gatorade balloon, and then it's two birds, one stone?

30:12.640 --> 30:13.680
Yeah. Exactly.

30:13.680 --> 30:15.680
You just put the coach right under the basket when you dunk.

30:15.680 --> 30:19.120
Both the coaches have to stand under their baskets, too. That's key.

30:19.120 --> 30:22.240
That's fun. And maybe we could, maybe it could be like a fundraiser.

30:23.200 --> 30:28.960
Or a fundraiser. Oh, it's gonna be that for sure. There's a dog park near my work,

30:28.960 --> 30:33.280
and sometimes I go there to eat lunch. I don't even ask to pet the puppies. I just sit on a

30:33.280 --> 30:38.000
bench and eat a sandwich and watch the dogs play, and then I leave when I'm done. I feel like this

30:38.000 --> 30:42.800
is totally normal, or at least not creepy behavior, but the other day a dude got all up in my face

30:42.800 --> 30:47.600
about it. He said if I didn't have a dog with me, I shouldn't be there. I got flustered and left,

30:47.600 --> 30:51.840
but now I can't help but wonder, was he the asshole, or am I unknowingly creeping out the

30:51.840 --> 30:59.520
puppies? That's from Puppy Peepin Improvo. He is the asshole. No puppy. No, no, no.

30:59.520 --> 31:02.800
The person yelling at him. Oh, okay, good, good, good, good.

31:02.800 --> 31:07.760
Real quick sidebar. Anthony on Twitter tweeted that Scott Bakula's decent at best,

31:07.760 --> 31:13.680
and I responded, don't be a moron. First one down. I'm fucking trembling right now. I feel high.

31:13.680 --> 31:19.760
17 minutes, no one's tweeted about carryaways. Okay. We'll get them. We'll get them. We'll

31:19.760 --> 31:23.760
bring them in. I still haven't picked one. Yeah, it's fun, man. I'm like, who the fuck? I'm like

31:23.760 --> 31:30.080
fucking hopped up right now. I'm feeling punchy. I did a Google search for the nicest celebrities

31:30.080 --> 31:34.560
because I want to be worth it. Yeah, sure. I want to be-

31:34.560 --> 31:37.680
Justin, can I pitch one for you? Yeah, sure.

31:37.680 --> 31:42.480
Steve Buscemi. Yeah, is he active on Twitter though? It seems like he would have better

31:42.480 --> 31:46.000
things to do. But no, that's going to be a rough one because I feel like Steve Buscemi falls into

31:46.000 --> 31:49.840
this weird category of just everybody feels like, oh, it's okay to make fun of how he looks. Oh,

31:49.840 --> 31:55.040
Steve Buscemi. It's totally fine to make fun of how he looks. That's okay. That's cool. We can

31:55.040 --> 32:01.040
meme that. That's easy. Guess what? When you make fun of Steve Funny, see, even I'm in it.

32:01.040 --> 32:06.640
I'm too deep in. When you make fun of Steve Buscemi's appearance, that's not a meme. That's a

32:06.640 --> 32:13.120
meme. Just think about what you say. Just think about how your words would affect him.

32:14.640 --> 32:19.520
What about Keanu Reeves? How is that- See, I think that would be a busy job for you,

32:19.520 --> 32:24.720
but I think he needs the most defending. It seems like he might need some help.

32:24.720 --> 32:29.920
I think he'd really appreciate it above all else, but in a really chill way. Thank you.

32:29.920 --> 32:34.800
Oh, he's a chill bro. I didn't expect that. I can't believe this has happened to you,

32:34.800 --> 32:38.960
and I want to apologize. I don't even own a dog. I'm not a part of that community. I want to

32:38.960 --> 32:43.280
apologize on behalf of them because it's not a crime to look at some dogs. It's not like you're

32:43.280 --> 32:52.320
posted outside of where the babies chill out after they get out. The baby park where they can go out

32:52.320 --> 32:56.000
and just poop and run around all day. And do whatever. It's not like that. It's not like

32:56.000 --> 32:59.040
you're scoping out somebody's kids. You know what I mean? You're just looking at some dogs,

32:59.040 --> 33:02.800
and dogs are there to be looked at. That's just it. That's just it. Especially if you're not

33:02.800 --> 33:07.040
bothering anyone, and you're not doing shit. It would be one thing if you were walking around

33:07.040 --> 33:10.880
the park being like, oh, is that your dog? Nice, nice. How you doing? That's creepy.

33:10.880 --> 33:15.040
But if you're just sitting on a bench outside the fence eating your sandwich-

33:15.040 --> 33:20.000
Now wait, but wait. You've just said it. What's on that sandwich? What's on that sandwich?

33:21.280 --> 33:25.600
Be honest with yourself. If you're eating a sandwich full of things that dogs would just

33:25.600 --> 33:36.400
go fucking crazy for, like bagging the strips. A BSLT. A BSLT. Then you know what you're doing.

33:36.400 --> 33:40.880
You know you just go to that dog park just to see who you can get riled up. And maybe you should

33:40.880 --> 33:46.400
leave. Are you riling up the puppies? Are you sitting there whispering through the fence?

33:47.360 --> 33:54.320
I heard Princess Tickle saying some bullshit about you, and you're trying to get a kerfuffle

33:54.320 --> 34:00.160
going on in the dog park. Are you a dog park dirt stirrer? Well, maybe don't do that. But if you're

34:00.160 --> 34:05.200
just going to calmly sit there, maybe do a little candy crush on your phone, eat a sandwich, and in

34:05.200 --> 34:09.760
between candy crush levels, scope out the puppies, I don't see anything wrong with that.

34:11.680 --> 34:15.600
I just remembered another person's joke, which I'd like to say on the podcast,

34:15.600 --> 34:20.160
which was from the hit website, Steve Don't Eat It, which is maybe my favorite website.

34:20.160 --> 34:25.040
And Steve Don't Eat It once reviewed bagging strips, which they ate,

34:25.040 --> 34:28.800
and said that it tasted like the smoky puke of a thousand maniacs.

34:33.760 --> 34:37.360
I don't think there's anything wrong to look at a dog. I really don't think there's anything wrong

34:37.360 --> 34:42.320
to look at a dog. Are they saying that you're some sort of pervert for looking at a dog? If

34:42.320 --> 34:46.080
that's the case, I've seen every Air Bud movie. Does that make me a pervert? Yeah, it does.

34:46.080 --> 34:50.240
It definitely, definitely does. It definitely, definitely does.

34:52.080 --> 34:54.560
I have a few names I want to float by you guys. Okay.

34:54.560 --> 34:59.600
Just like celebs that have been rattling around my head, okay? Tom Cavanagh.

34:59.600 --> 35:02.640
Ooh. That's a good pick, right?

35:02.640 --> 35:09.840
I'm a big fan. I'm a big fan of Tom, but I feel like Tom is like... I feel like there's a chance

35:09.840 --> 35:13.760
to... I don't want to be somebody who I think I'll meet, you know what I mean?

35:13.760 --> 35:16.160
Exactly. I feel like there's a chance I can meet Tom Cavanagh.

35:16.160 --> 35:18.240
Cavanagh can really hold his own too, you know what I mean?

35:18.240 --> 35:22.240
Yeah, Tom Cavanagh doesn't really need to. I've listened to Mike and Tom Eat Snacks,

35:22.240 --> 35:23.920
and I feel like he's a podcaster. That's another thing. I don't think

35:23.920 --> 35:25.680
we should do a podcaster because that's fucking weird.

35:25.680 --> 35:29.280
Let me hit you with this. I'm pretty into this one. I'm kind of...

35:29.280 --> 35:32.080
This one's been rattling around. What about Joshua Jackson?

35:32.960 --> 35:35.920
Now, that's someone I could really sink my teeth into.

35:37.680 --> 35:41.600
Now, Joshua Jackson I could get... Joshy, as I call it, I could get into.

35:41.600 --> 35:44.320
I'm currently deciding between... It's going to be one of these two.

35:44.320 --> 35:46.880
Either Joshua Jackson or Stephen Amell.

35:47.520 --> 35:47.760
Who?

35:48.960 --> 35:50.000
Stephen Amell.

35:50.640 --> 35:51.760
See, I don't...

35:51.760 --> 35:52.400
The arrow.

35:53.920 --> 35:57.280
Now, see, that's going to be busy for you because now he's all up in the WWE.

35:57.280 --> 36:01.120
Yeah, and I feel like he's a little bit too new on the scene,

36:01.120 --> 36:03.680
where I feel like a Joshua Jackson, you're going to get people...

36:03.680 --> 36:09.200
For example, I see this guy on Twitter talking about how Cary Elwes is so good

36:09.200 --> 36:13.440
in Princess Bride and the worst piece of shit in everything else.

36:13.440 --> 36:15.360
Oh, boy. Did you treat him yet?

36:15.360 --> 36:16.480
Yes, I did.

36:16.480 --> 36:17.200
What'd you say?

36:17.200 --> 36:19.920
I feel like I could have been meaner. I think I just said...

36:20.720 --> 36:25.200
Because he also said, I talked to Cary Elwes and he said he died after Princess Bride,

36:25.200 --> 36:27.520
so he's sorry, but it's hard to act as a rotting corpse.

36:28.080 --> 36:32.800
And I responded, he's alive and well and an amazing actor, thank you very much.

36:32.800 --> 36:34.400
I think I probably could have been meaner.

36:34.400 --> 36:41.120
I don't feel like anybody would say anything negative about Joshua Jackson.

36:41.120 --> 36:42.000
And that's why when they do-

36:42.000 --> 36:42.640
And that's why when they do-

36:42.640 --> 36:43.680
You don't think you get a lot of like,

36:44.560 --> 36:47.840
keep swimming in Dawson's Creek and stay out of such and such.

36:47.840 --> 36:49.120
You don't think you'd get that kind of thing.

36:49.120 --> 36:52.960
Okay, but here's the question, and this is really actually very important.

36:52.960 --> 37:01.120
Do I keep a Twitter handle search for Joshua Jackson, of course, as Vancity Jaxx,

37:01.120 --> 37:06.240
or do I keep a Joshua Jackson cowards column?

37:06.240 --> 37:08.720
You're gonna have to do both. I've got both going right now.

37:08.720 --> 37:11.440
Okay, that's good.

37:11.440 --> 37:15.680
I've got an at Cary Elwes and I have just Cary Elwes sub-tweeting.

37:16.880 --> 37:19.280
I'm ready to jump down anyone's throats.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.680
Travis also has the Cary Elves with a V,

37:21.680 --> 37:23.840
just like if people misspell it and they're trying to talk shit.

37:23.840 --> 37:30.480
And C-A-R-R-Y Elwes and C-A-R, it's basically-

37:30.480 --> 37:31.040
It's a lot.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.400
I've had to get a second screen.

37:33.440 --> 37:36.480
I do want to say, Justin, Joshua Jackson,

37:36.480 --> 37:38.640
I don't think people are gonna say a lot of mean things about him.

37:38.640 --> 37:40.640
And that's exactly why you need to defend him,

37:40.640 --> 37:44.400
is because when they do say a mean thing about him, I don't think that he'll be-

37:45.200 --> 37:46.960
I just wanna be active in this pursuit.

37:46.960 --> 37:50.560
I don't want to be a hollow thing like everything else in my life, I'll lose interest.

37:50.560 --> 37:56.880
Can we acknowledge the fact that we have been recording now for about 40 minutes-ish?

37:56.880 --> 38:00.480
And in that time, in a 40-minute window in the universe,

38:00.480 --> 38:05.520
people have said mean shit about Cary Elwes and Scott Vagala.

38:05.520 --> 38:08.960
I didn't expect that kind of turnaround on this goof.

38:08.960 --> 38:10.800
That like, nope, yup, yup, yup, there were-

38:10.800 --> 38:13.760
Travis, unfortunately, I'm gonna have to take away your verified check mark,

38:13.760 --> 38:15.760
because apparently you don't know fuck all about Twitter.

38:16.400 --> 38:16.640
Yeah.

38:16.640 --> 38:22.160
I was thinking like maybe once a day, somebody would say something mean about Cary Elwes.

38:22.160 --> 38:23.840
I don't know that I've got the time.

38:25.040 --> 38:25.840
Oh, I got it.

38:26.560 --> 38:27.360
Pierce Brosnan.

38:28.080 --> 38:28.880
Solid.

38:28.880 --> 38:29.680
Don't even-

38:29.680 --> 38:30.800
Boom goes the dynamite.

38:30.800 --> 38:33.520
Don't even say anything about Pierce Brosnan on Twitter.

38:33.520 --> 38:34.640
I will come for you.

38:35.280 --> 38:36.000
Get pierced.

38:37.280 --> 38:41.200
I like that, because I think that Pierce Brosnan seems tough,

38:41.200 --> 38:43.760
but I think that he's probably a very sensitive soul,

38:43.760 --> 38:47.920
that if you say like, yeah, go sit in your invisible car, dumbass,

38:47.920 --> 38:49.760
like he probably cries a little bit.

38:50.400 --> 38:50.800
Yeah.

38:50.800 --> 38:52.960
And he should, that's mean, people shouldn't say that.

38:54.560 --> 38:58.960
I'm gonna spend more time standing up for Pierce Brosnan.

38:59.520 --> 39:01.440
Not gonna follow him, it seems like.

39:01.440 --> 39:04.960
Oh fuck no, there's no way on earth I'm following Scott Vagala.

39:04.960 --> 39:06.320
It's new in CIS.

39:06.320 --> 39:08.720
Fucking no way, are you kidding me?

39:08.720 --> 39:10.240
That's too close to the heat.

39:10.240 --> 39:11.600
I don't follow Cary Elwes.

39:11.600 --> 39:14.560
Hey, quit saying my name rhymes with Dracula.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.720
Scott, I fucking get it, okay, dawg?

39:16.720 --> 39:18.480
Let's go to the money zone, please God.

39:18.480 --> 39:19.440
Yeah, here we go.

39:19.440 --> 39:32.240
I'm almost done, let me, you guys go ahead and start.

39:32.240 --> 39:34.720
I just gotta get my Pierce Brosnan column like up and ready.

39:34.720 --> 39:37.040
Yeah, yeah, start the dragnet.

39:37.040 --> 39:38.960
I'm gonna start talking about me undies,

39:38.960 --> 39:40.640
the best underwear that you can wear.

39:40.640 --> 39:42.480
Whether you're wearing a suit, whether you're wearing sweats,

39:42.480 --> 39:44.720
you spend 24 hours a day in your underwear.

39:44.720 --> 39:46.800
The underwear that you wear down there all the time

39:46.800 --> 39:49.120
against your most precious materials,

39:49.120 --> 39:50.400
it's probably pretty boring.

39:50.400 --> 39:53.280
Me undies wants to fix that, they wanna make it exciting.

39:53.280 --> 39:55.840
They wanna liven up your downtown situation,

39:55.840 --> 39:58.400
like a Mardi Gras or like Carnival.

39:59.200 --> 40:03.520
All these underwear is made out of sustainably sourced modal,

40:03.520 --> 40:05.840
and that's a fabric that's twice as soft as cotton.

40:05.840 --> 40:09.120
Gang, I have like seven or eight pairs of me undies now,

40:09.120 --> 40:12.000
and it's like, I get excited to wear them.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.480
And pretty soon I'll have replaced my whole collection

40:14.480 --> 40:17.360
with me undies, and then it's just gonna be a nonstop,

40:17.360 --> 40:19.360
just like cool breeze festival down there.

40:19.360 --> 40:22.000
I'll tell you what, the me undies has become my metric

40:22.000 --> 40:24.480
for when it's time to like do laundry,

40:24.480 --> 40:26.960
because it's like, oh, on my last pair of clean me undies,

40:26.960 --> 40:28.160
it's laundry day today.

40:28.160 --> 40:30.480
Yeah, me undies is dedicated to providing

40:30.480 --> 40:31.840
the world's most comfortable underwear.

40:31.840 --> 40:34.320
In this pursuit, I would say that they have already succeeded.

40:34.320 --> 40:36.400
If you don't love your first pair, they're free.

40:36.400 --> 40:38.160
No questions asked, here, have your money back.

40:38.160 --> 40:39.280
Here, have your money back.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.480
There's dozens of styles and limited edition prints

40:42.480 --> 40:44.240
to help you make a statement with your underwear.

40:44.240 --> 40:45.760

40:45.760 --> 40:47.360
and you can save up to $8 a pair

40:47.360 --> 40:49.040

That's meundies.com slash my brother

40:56.080 --> 40:57.760

40:57.760 --> 41:01.120

41:01.120 --> 41:04.080
It feels so good, they have cool designs all the time.

41:04.080 --> 41:07.280
You get matching underwear for you and a loved one.

41:07.280 --> 41:09.200
Travis and I wear matching underwear almost every day.

41:09.200 --> 41:10.240
We text each other in the morning,

41:10.240 --> 41:11.600
like, which one are you going with?

41:11.600 --> 41:15.680
And Travis is like, the one with the different boom boxes

41:15.680 --> 41:16.640
on it, and I'm like, hell yeah, son.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.400
I sent him a picture of my bear dick,

41:18.400 --> 41:20.000
and then I sent him a picture of my dick

41:20.000 --> 41:22.560
with the me undies on, but like,

41:22.560 --> 41:24.160
if you flip back and forth between them real quick,

41:24.160 --> 41:25.600
it looks like a magic trick.

41:25.600 --> 41:27.120
Yeah, it looks like a magic eye painting.

41:28.880 --> 41:31.840
I'd like to take a moment, if you guys are quite finished,

41:31.840 --> 41:33.120
to talk about Bowling Branch.

41:34.240 --> 41:36.080
We have been sleeping on Bowling Branch sheets

41:36.080 --> 41:37.680
here at our house for a couple months now,

41:37.680 --> 41:40.000
and I can't sleep without them.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.400
If I go out of town, I just lie awake,

41:42.400 --> 41:45.440
staring at the ceiling, just praying for daylight.

41:46.640 --> 41:49.840
And that's the way I've been ruined by Bowling Branch.

41:49.840 --> 41:52.880
They'll let you try these sheets for 30 nights,

41:52.880 --> 41:56.240
and I promise you, you're gonna need just one.

41:56.240 --> 41:57.520
And if you don't love them, you can send them back.

41:57.520 --> 41:58.240
You have nothing to lose.

41:58.240 --> 41:59.360
It gets even better, though.

42:13.680 --> 42:17.840
and they are super comfortable sheets.

42:17.840 --> 42:19.200
They're sheeps, also.

42:19.200 --> 42:21.760
They'll sell you sheeps, but I wouldn't recommend it.

42:21.760 --> 42:22.960

42:49.600 --> 42:52.240
I would also like to tell you a little bit

42:52.240 --> 42:55.920
about Smash Fiction, the podcast.

42:55.920 --> 42:57.920
You should listen, you should subscribe.

42:57.920 --> 42:58.960
Here's why.

42:58.960 --> 43:01.120
The Power Rangers vs. Godzilla.

43:01.120 --> 43:02.880
Gandalf vs. Dumbledore.

43:02.880 --> 43:04.720
Batman vs. Dr. Doom.

43:04.720 --> 43:06.400
The Smash Fiction podcast settles

43:06.400 --> 43:08.240
the most important issues of the day.

43:08.240 --> 43:10.080
Who would win if different fictional characters

43:10.080 --> 43:12.480
clashed in battle of strengths or wits?

43:12.480 --> 43:15.040
Smash Fiction is a debate-style comedy podcast

43:15.040 --> 43:17.120
in which a rotating cast of nerds battle

43:17.120 --> 43:18.960
on behalf of their chosen characters

43:18.960 --> 43:21.840
and a single impartial judge decides who wins.

43:23.040 --> 43:25.760
I think that that sounds pretty damn good.

43:25.760 --> 43:27.200
Who would win in a fight?

43:27.200 --> 43:30.720
Pierce Brosnan, Carrie Elwes, or Scott Bakula?

43:30.720 --> 43:32.240
Scott Bakula.

43:32.240 --> 43:34.080
I actually think it would be Pierce Brosnan.

43:34.080 --> 43:36.000
I started listening to this podcast

43:36.000 --> 43:40.320
and my first thought was, wow, this guy has a great voice.

43:40.320 --> 43:42.160
And then I thought, man, I'm learning a lot

43:42.160 --> 43:43.840
about architecture and design.

43:43.840 --> 43:45.360
And then I realized I had been listening

43:45.360 --> 43:47.360
to 99% Invisible and that was on me.

43:47.360 --> 43:48.880
That's my fault. You goofed up.

43:48.880 --> 43:50.800
I goofed up. You blew it.

43:50.800 --> 43:51.840
I blew it, okay?

43:54.160 --> 43:55.680
I just wanna get that off my chest.

43:55.680 --> 43:56.640
I have another message here.

43:56.640 --> 43:58.960
This one's for M Huff and it's from,

43:58.960 --> 44:01.120
oh, a bunch of stuff.

44:01.120 --> 44:04.880
It's from Weed Mom, Fish Ass Lover,

44:04.880 --> 44:07.040
Cat Hustler, and One Lunch Man.

44:08.320 --> 44:09.600
And this Motley...

44:09.600 --> 44:11.760
My fish ass lover.

44:13.520 --> 44:14.020
Nope.

44:15.040 --> 44:16.160
This Motley Crue says,

44:16.160 --> 44:18.480
happy birthday to our favorite whiskey dad.

44:18.480 --> 44:19.920
We are so delighted to be friends

44:19.920 --> 44:22.720
with a wonderful owlficionado like you,

44:22.720 --> 44:26.160
even if you can't help it with all these gosh darn,

44:26.960 --> 44:28.640
a little rude language in here,

44:28.640 --> 44:30.240
ridiculous eggs.

44:30.240 --> 44:32.880
Whether it's yelling about treats

44:32.880 --> 44:34.960
or thirsting hard over ruinous elves,

44:34.960 --> 44:36.480
you're our problematic fave

44:36.480 --> 44:38.000
and we wouldn't have it any other way.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.120
Here's to many more years

44:39.120 --> 44:40.720
of nestling in the garbage together

44:40.720 --> 44:42.880
and wallowing in our filthy...

44:42.880 --> 44:44.800
Hey, let's look up that word

44:44.800 --> 44:45.760
before we just say it.

44:45.760 --> 44:48.160
I think it's a beast, bro.

44:48.160 --> 44:50.480
Occasionally shortened to fujopan

44:50.480 --> 44:51.600
or just a fujo,

44:51.600 --> 44:52.720
this word is a slang term

44:52.720 --> 44:55.920
for an extremely bad quality manga scanslation.

44:55.920 --> 44:58.800
And now I gotta fucking Google that one.

45:00.800 --> 45:02.800
The art of turning a manga from one language

45:02.800 --> 45:03.680
into a different language

45:03.680 --> 45:04.880
includes translation of the story

45:04.880 --> 45:06.080
and editing of the actual artwork.

45:06.080 --> 45:07.440
Scanslations are done by fans

45:07.440 --> 45:08.560
for the whole fan community.

45:09.440 --> 45:10.240
This seems okay.

45:10.240 --> 45:11.440
Go ahead and say it, Griffin.

45:11.440 --> 45:13.600
Wallowing in our filthy fujo ways.

45:13.600 --> 45:14.320
If I just said,

45:14.320 --> 45:16.400
like that's the most work I've ever done

45:16.400 --> 45:18.080
to make sure something's not racist.

45:18.080 --> 45:20.080
So please like, if I...

45:20.080 --> 45:21.920
So the next time we say something racist,

45:21.920 --> 45:23.280
please remember this

45:23.280 --> 45:25.280
and just like give us credit for this.

45:25.280 --> 45:27.840
But this may have been racist, whatever.

45:30.240 --> 45:31.680
Their birthday is Saturday,

45:32.880 --> 45:33.840
September 6th.

45:33.840 --> 45:36.080
So they wanted this message around then.

45:36.080 --> 45:37.360
So like this message so far,

45:37.360 --> 45:40.160
I would say it's been just a complete catastrophe.

45:40.160 --> 45:41.360
Just a complete fiasco

45:41.360 --> 45:42.960
from fucking start to finish.

45:42.960 --> 45:44.080
I'm sorry, Imhoff.

45:44.080 --> 45:45.680
Imhoff, we did our best.

45:45.680 --> 45:46.960
We literally did as...

45:46.960 --> 45:47.920
That's the most effort

45:47.920 --> 45:49.600
I've ever done on this podcast before.

45:49.600 --> 45:51.200
Happy birthday, whiskey dad.

45:52.080 --> 45:54.240
And just good luck.

45:54.240 --> 45:54.960
Good luck to me.

45:54.960 --> 45:56.960
I'm gonna need my own fucking Scott Bakula defender

45:56.960 --> 46:26.320
after this episode goes up.

46:26.320 --> 46:27.280
Yeah, I got one here.

46:28.320 --> 46:30.720
And this one was sent in by

46:31.760 --> 46:33.520
Love 9000, Yajra, Drew, Drew Davenport.

46:33.520 --> 46:33.920
Thank you, Drew.

46:33.920 --> 46:36.160
It's by Yajra Answers user, The Hooded One.

46:38.160 --> 46:40.000
Who says, I've got a secret.

46:41.600 --> 46:43.120
The Hooded One says,

46:44.000 --> 46:47.360
where can you find lots of gold?

46:48.320 --> 46:49.760
I'm a man in my late 30s.

46:49.760 --> 46:51.120
I wanna have a lot of treasure?

46:51.680 --> 46:55.360
Gold, jewels, rubies, diamonds.

46:55.360 --> 46:56.480
Where can I find this?

46:57.280 --> 47:04.000
I wanna have my own Steve Zahn Sahara quest.

47:04.000 --> 47:07.360
I wanna have my own national treasure book of secrets.

47:07.360 --> 47:09.680
I wanna have my own The Mummy 2.

47:09.680 --> 47:11.440
The Mummy gets back in there.

47:12.080 --> 47:13.920
The Mummy 2, still mummying.

47:14.480 --> 47:16.480
The Mummy 2, too many mummies.

47:17.200 --> 47:18.560
This is a good question.

47:19.360 --> 47:20.800
And I'll tell you why.

47:20.800 --> 47:22.960
Cause where is treasure kept?

47:24.240 --> 47:25.120
In a treasure chest.

47:25.120 --> 47:25.440
Okay.

47:26.160 --> 47:26.400
Okay.

47:26.960 --> 47:30.400
So like, it's really a chicken and the egg thing.

47:30.400 --> 47:32.400
Because if you buy the chest first,

47:32.400 --> 47:34.160
and then you get some gold,

47:34.720 --> 47:37.440
just like a regular amount of gold that you would get,

47:37.440 --> 47:38.640
and then you dump in the chest,

47:38.640 --> 47:40.240
I bet it looks ridiculous, right?

47:41.120 --> 47:43.520
It has to be at least three quarters full

47:43.520 --> 47:47.280
for it to even merit having a chest full of treasure.

47:47.280 --> 47:49.120
How much treasure do you have to get

47:49.120 --> 47:50.400
before you sit there and be like,

47:50.400 --> 47:52.000
I need to get a chest for that.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.120
I need to get a chest for this,

47:53.120 --> 47:56.400
cause that problem is like before that moment,

47:57.200 --> 47:58.080
what do you just have?

47:58.080 --> 48:00.480
Like a Kroger bag full of gold?

48:00.480 --> 48:02.880
You've got a reusable shopping bag of gold.

48:03.840 --> 48:06.560
Do you think you start with a very, very small chest?

48:08.240 --> 48:11.120
A big chest is mostly full of balled up socks,

48:11.120 --> 48:13.760
but then there's some gold on top of it.

48:13.760 --> 48:15.920
They never dig deep in movies

48:15.920 --> 48:17.280
where treasure chests are unearthed

48:17.280 --> 48:19.680
to see this just like USA Today's

48:19.680 --> 48:21.120
that have been crumpled up to add volume.

48:21.120 --> 48:23.760
We found old black beard pirate Carruthers

48:23.760 --> 48:25.360
secret chest of goodies.

48:25.360 --> 48:27.120
Ah, sick, look at all these gold nugs.

48:27.120 --> 48:28.800
This is, ah, there's mostly socks in here.

48:28.800 --> 48:29.360
Here's a note.

48:29.360 --> 48:30.720
Yarr, gotcha.

48:30.720 --> 48:32.400
Gotcha, suckers.

48:32.400 --> 48:33.840
Please don't take the socks.

48:33.840 --> 48:34.640
I need those.

48:34.640 --> 48:35.840
I need these socks.

48:37.280 --> 48:41.680
You know, the reason they have to have real food

48:41.680 --> 48:44.960
in commercials is that Chunky was trying to sell

48:44.960 --> 48:46.480
this new soup with lots of vegetables,

48:46.480 --> 48:48.400
but the vegetables kept sinking to the bottom.

48:48.400 --> 48:50.160
So they filled the bowl with marbles

48:50.160 --> 48:52.480
and then dumped the soup on top of it

48:52.480 --> 48:54.080
to make it look more veggie.

48:54.080 --> 48:55.840
That would be, that would be chunky.

48:56.480 --> 48:57.840
Yeah, it was very chunky.

48:57.840 --> 48:59.840
That actually sounds mad chunky.

48:59.840 --> 49:02.160
And exceedingly crunchy, I would say.

49:02.160 --> 49:04.080
I learned that at 99% Invisible, by the way,

49:04.080 --> 49:05.120
so kiss here.

49:05.120 --> 49:07.440
Well, but so then did somebody eat the marbles?

49:08.240 --> 49:09.360
Somebody, no, Travis,

49:09.360 --> 49:11.680
they didn't put marbles in the fucking cans.

49:11.680 --> 49:13.760
You couldn't go down, but then why would,

49:13.760 --> 49:16.080
but you posed it as though they did that

49:16.080 --> 49:17.520
and then there was some executive like,

49:17.520 --> 49:20.640
hey, hey, hey, from now on, real food in the bowls.

49:20.640 --> 49:22.320
No, it's crazier than that.

49:22.320 --> 49:26.240
The federal government somehow unearthed their secret,

49:26.240 --> 49:30.000
like what kind of deep throat marble mouth nonsense

49:30.000 --> 49:32.720
is like, somebody's like, listen, you need to dig deeper.

49:32.720 --> 49:33.840
Dig below the vegetables.

49:33.840 --> 49:35.360
Dig below the carrots.

49:35.360 --> 49:37.600
To see if they're, get an x-ray camera

49:37.600 --> 49:39.280
and run it over the commercial

49:39.280 --> 49:41.120
and see if you spy any marbles.

49:41.920 --> 49:44.000
You gotta jump into the screen like Poltergeist.

49:44.960 --> 49:46.560
I've always felt that like,

49:46.560 --> 49:47.760
this question makes me think of

49:47.760 --> 49:49.440
how much video games lied to me

49:49.440 --> 49:52.080
about how this scenario works as an adult

49:52.080 --> 49:54.560
of like walking around and like smashing a pot

49:54.560 --> 49:57.040
or like opening a box and finding money.

49:57.040 --> 49:57.440
No repeats in there, yeah.

49:57.440 --> 49:59.680
And how much better the world would be if that happened,

49:59.680 --> 50:02.240
except that like there's somebody on the other end of that.

50:03.360 --> 50:06.320
Yeah, let me hit you guys with this scenario.

50:07.200 --> 50:09.840
You take a baseball bat and a slingshot

50:09.840 --> 50:13.520
for the jugs and vases that they have up on shelves

50:13.520 --> 50:14.800
that you can't reach normally

50:14.800 --> 50:16.400
and you wanna blast them like that.

50:17.120 --> 50:19.760
I think if you took those two pieces of gear

50:19.760 --> 50:20.880
and basically were allowed,

50:20.880 --> 50:23.680
you were given 10 minutes to just supermarket sweep

50:23.680 --> 50:25.920
fucking guys' grocery games, the whole space.

50:26.480 --> 50:30.560
If you do that shit up in Glenn Beck's house,

50:31.840 --> 50:35.040
cause you know, if there's one motherfucker on this earth

50:35.040 --> 50:38.720
that wants to leave behind a legacy of a pirate hoard,

50:38.720 --> 50:40.960
is that fool that's like, sell me your gold.

50:40.960 --> 50:42.000
I'm good for it.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.520
Why do you need all that gold, Glenn Beck?

50:43.520 --> 50:44.720
I'll tell you why.

50:44.720 --> 50:48.160
Cause you wanna be the new pirate king.

50:48.160 --> 50:49.360
That's what's up.

50:49.360 --> 50:52.160
If you go up in his house and you do smash open a jug,

50:52.160 --> 50:53.600
he's like, oh no, you found it.

50:53.600 --> 50:55.520
Like a hundred golden coins comes out.

50:58.160 --> 51:00.240
I'm saying when that dude dies

51:00.240 --> 51:04.000
or just retires from television and radio,

51:05.120 --> 51:06.080
he's gonna be like,

51:06.080 --> 51:10.000
I know I've been kind of an abrasive figure, but-

51:10.000 --> 51:11.360
Somewhat polarizing.

51:11.360 --> 51:15.120
But anyway, I'm about to kick off my own rat race.

51:15.120 --> 51:15.840
And then he drops a full blown-

51:15.840 --> 51:17.600
In my house with bats.

51:17.600 --> 51:18.400
A full blown-

51:18.400 --> 51:20.160
I hate all my stuff so much.

51:20.160 --> 51:21.680
You know it's not in his house.

51:21.680 --> 51:24.640
His house will include the first piece of the map.

51:24.640 --> 51:25.360
You know what I mean?

51:25.920 --> 51:28.720
Yeah, you're gonna need to look behind a portrait of him.

51:28.720 --> 51:30.400
Fuck that, no, oh my God, you guys.

51:30.960 --> 51:33.280
Look at every chalkboard doodle he's ever done

51:33.280 --> 51:34.240
on his crazy show.

51:35.040 --> 51:36.960
And if you look up in the top left corner,

51:36.960 --> 51:39.360
there's a little bit of the map every time.

51:39.360 --> 51:40.800
Every time.

51:40.800 --> 51:43.440
It's all so obvious now.

51:43.440 --> 51:45.760
It's all been waiting there for you.

51:45.760 --> 51:47.600
Pirate King backyards.

51:47.600 --> 51:49.920
Me, Obama's a Muslim.

51:49.920 --> 51:50.880
Yarrr.

51:50.880 --> 51:52.560
Yarrr.

51:52.560 --> 51:53.920
You crack open the chest and it's like,

51:53.920 --> 51:55.280
fuck yeah, it's full of gold coins.

51:55.280 --> 51:56.720
You dig in a little bit deeper.

51:56.720 --> 51:58.720
And it's full of also some socks

51:58.720 --> 51:59.680
and a note that says,

52:00.480 --> 52:02.320
everyone forgets about the Hussein

52:02.320 --> 52:03.760
in the middle of Barack Obama's name,

52:03.760 --> 52:05.280
but I think it's important.

52:05.280 --> 52:06.640
Anyway, congratulations.

52:06.640 --> 52:10.240
Enjoy these $150 and socks.

52:10.960 --> 52:12.480
I feel like the video would talk about

52:12.480 --> 52:13.680
how it's all leading you

52:13.680 --> 52:15.200
to the greatest treasure imaginable

52:15.200 --> 52:16.960
when you open the last chest.

52:16.960 --> 52:19.200
It's just a note that has the word freedom

52:19.200 --> 52:20.400
written in block letters.

52:20.400 --> 52:22.080
It's like, ah fuck.

52:22.080 --> 52:23.040
He's right though.

52:23.040 --> 52:23.920
Is he right?

52:23.920 --> 52:24.640
He's not right.

52:24.640 --> 52:25.840
No, he's not right.

52:25.840 --> 52:27.200
What if you open the chest

52:27.200 --> 52:28.800
and it had a million dollars in it

52:28.800 --> 52:30.400
or like a lot of money in it,

52:30.400 --> 52:31.520
but all in pennies?

52:33.200 --> 52:34.720
So like it was really full,

52:34.720 --> 52:37.920
but like it's pennies.

52:38.720 --> 52:39.680
Yeah, for sure, Travis.

52:39.680 --> 52:41.440
What if Sahara ended

52:41.440 --> 52:44.480
and Steve Zahn and McConaughey

52:44.480 --> 52:46.240
and I forget who else was in that picture,

52:46.800 --> 52:49.440
finds, I think maybe a Beck and Sale,

52:49.440 --> 52:51.360
finds the old sunken plane full of treasure

52:51.360 --> 52:52.400
and it's like, fuck yeah, guys,

52:52.400 --> 52:54.560
we won, we beat all the pirates and we did it.

52:54.560 --> 52:55.600
And they crack it open

52:55.600 --> 52:58.480
and it's 700,000 pounds of pennies.

52:58.480 --> 53:01.040
It's like, well, let's just go home

53:01.040 --> 53:02.240
because like we're in the desert.

53:03.440 --> 53:04.320
Nevermind.

53:04.320 --> 53:06.000
I'm not carrying this out.

53:06.000 --> 53:07.280
The amount of money it would cost

53:07.280 --> 53:08.640
to get these pennies from one place

53:08.640 --> 53:09.520
to the other would cost more

53:09.520 --> 53:10.400
than the pennies themselves.

53:10.400 --> 53:11.760
You got us again, Glenn Beck.

53:12.720 --> 53:14.320
Damn you, Pirate King.

53:15.680 --> 53:16.640
Classic Glenn.

53:16.640 --> 53:17.840
Do you think there's a piece of the map

53:17.840 --> 53:18.800
in Glenn Beck's body?

53:19.520 --> 53:20.020
Yeah.

53:20.800 --> 53:23.040
Like the blue lady from Fifth Element?

53:23.600 --> 53:25.440
Like a Horcrux kind of thing?

53:25.440 --> 53:29.520
I was imagining more like Cheech Marin

53:29.520 --> 53:32.000
in I think Once Upon a Time in Mexico.

53:32.000 --> 53:33.440
You pop out that eye,

53:33.440 --> 53:34.320
that fake eye.

53:34.320 --> 53:35.280
What is that back there?

53:35.840 --> 53:37.520
It could also be the tattooed

53:39.600 --> 53:40.640
top of the dude's head.

53:40.640 --> 53:41.840
Holy shit.

53:42.400 --> 53:43.520
Oh, don't say it.

53:43.520 --> 53:44.240
Oh, what is it?

53:45.600 --> 53:46.880
Oh, Cutthroat Island.

53:46.880 --> 53:47.680
Oh, whew.

53:47.680 --> 53:49.920
It could also be tattooed

53:49.920 --> 53:51.840
all over his body like Blindspot.

53:52.720 --> 53:53.760
You always see Glenn Beck.

53:53.760 --> 53:55.440
He's got a tightly buttoned up shirt

53:55.440 --> 53:56.720
and his pants are always on.

53:56.720 --> 53:58.480
You never see Glenn Beck without his pants on.

53:59.040 --> 54:01.360
And apparently I'm the only person

54:01.360 --> 54:02.480
that is weird too.

54:02.480 --> 54:03.840
Because if you took those pants off,

54:03.840 --> 54:05.440
Blindspot treasure map.

54:05.440 --> 54:06.720
I've never seen Blindspot

54:06.720 --> 54:08.160
except when John Hodgeman was on it.

54:09.360 --> 54:10.960
But I think it's about one

54:10.960 --> 54:12.240
with a treasure map on her body.

54:13.600 --> 54:14.560
Something like that.

54:14.560 --> 54:16.240
Which is also like Prison Break, right?

54:17.280 --> 54:19.520
Oh God, all these shows are connected.

54:19.520 --> 54:21.600
The last shot of the first episode

54:21.600 --> 54:23.840
of Prison Break is a young man,

54:23.840 --> 54:25.280
I believe Wentworth Miller,

54:25.280 --> 54:26.480
taking off his shirt to reveal

54:26.480 --> 54:27.520
that he has tattooed a map

54:27.520 --> 54:28.400
of the prison on himself.

54:28.400 --> 54:29.120
And that's why I said,

54:29.120 --> 54:30.560
well, I won't be watching this.

54:30.560 --> 54:31.040
Thank you.

54:31.040 --> 54:32.160
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

54:32.160 --> 54:33.920
Thanks for having me.

54:33.920 --> 54:35.280
This has been a lot of fun,

54:35.280 --> 54:36.560
but I think I'm gonna go ahead

54:36.560 --> 54:37.520
and hop off here

54:37.520 --> 54:39.040
before this train really gets moving.

54:39.040 --> 54:40.960
I think I can still walk back to the station.

54:40.960 --> 54:42.960
I would love if that scene happened

54:42.960 --> 54:44.160
and you revealed the map

54:44.160 --> 54:46.080
and one of the other prisoners was like,

54:46.080 --> 54:47.280
fuck, do you think the problem was

54:47.280 --> 54:49.680
we didn't know how to get around the place?

54:49.680 --> 54:51.280
Like we know where those rooms are.

54:51.280 --> 54:52.880
We've been in here for 20 years.

54:54.080 --> 54:55.600
They give this to you in a brochure

54:55.600 --> 54:56.400
when you come in.

54:56.400 --> 54:58.000
Are you fucking kidding me?

54:58.000 --> 54:59.120
It's on the wall.

54:59.120 --> 55:00.400
Do you think they refer to that

55:00.400 --> 55:02.000
frequently during the escape attempt?

55:02.000 --> 55:03.920
Like, hey, I'm lost.

55:03.920 --> 55:05.200
Whitworth, take off your shirts.

55:05.200 --> 55:06.240
I can stare at your belly.

55:08.560 --> 55:10.800
Remind me where the broom closet is.

55:10.800 --> 55:12.480
So we're behind your nipples right now,

55:12.480 --> 55:12.880
I guess.

55:12.880 --> 55:14.000
Or what are your nipples?

55:14.000 --> 55:15.760
And we gotta get to your other nipple.

55:15.760 --> 55:17.280
We just have to get to this hole.

55:17.280 --> 55:18.400
That's my belly button.

55:18.400 --> 55:20.880
Fuck, that was what the whole plan hinged around.

55:20.880 --> 55:21.920
That's our escape hole.

55:22.480 --> 55:24.000
Into your tum-tum, damn it.

55:25.200 --> 55:26.560
I think we took a left here

55:27.520 --> 55:28.960
and then we took a right

55:28.960 --> 55:30.320
at this art Chrome drawing

55:30.320 --> 55:32.000
that says keep on trucking.

55:32.000 --> 55:35.040
No, actually, that one was on there before.

55:35.040 --> 55:36.960
That's not actually part of the map.

55:36.960 --> 55:38.560
I should have clarified.

55:38.560 --> 55:40.080
I kind of worked around that.

55:40.080 --> 55:40.720
Just real quick.

55:40.720 --> 55:42.320
I think we're probably winding down.

55:44.400 --> 55:46.080
It seems like we're on sort of

55:46.080 --> 55:48.400
the slow sunsetting of Yahoo Answers.

55:49.840 --> 55:51.200
If it were up to me, we'd do it forever.

55:51.200 --> 55:53.360
But I feel like Yahoo Answers is like,

55:53.360 --> 55:54.480
you're going to wake up one morning

55:54.480 --> 55:56.400
and it's just as quickly as Travis was verified,

55:56.400 --> 55:58.080
Yahoo Answers is just going to be obliterated.

55:58.080 --> 55:59.920
So I want to celebrate the good times

55:59.920 --> 56:00.720
while we still have them.

56:00.720 --> 56:03.280
And Brooks Oglesby sent in this Yahoo.

56:03.280 --> 56:04.960
It was asked by an anonymous user,

56:04.960 --> 56:07.120
which kind of defeats the point of it.

56:08.320 --> 56:10.000
But this anonymous user says,

56:11.200 --> 56:12.640
I'm sorry for trolling?

56:13.600 --> 56:14.880
And then confesses,

56:14.880 --> 56:17.440
I posted the diarrhea questions online.

56:17.440 --> 56:19.760
And I realize now, it might've annoyed some people.

56:19.760 --> 56:20.800
I won't do it anymore.

56:20.800 --> 56:21.680
I'm really sorry.

56:24.720 --> 56:25.600
That's the thing.

56:25.600 --> 56:28.320
We talk, I mean, that's the thing.

56:28.320 --> 56:30.560
Like we harp on people for saying some stuff

56:30.560 --> 56:31.680
on Yahoo Answers.

56:31.680 --> 56:35.920
And I feel like when somebody is a bigger person

56:35.920 --> 56:37.200
and tries to get back on our good graces

56:37.200 --> 56:39.760
and like accepts and acknowledges what they've done,

56:39.760 --> 56:42.800
I feel like maybe we should recognize that as well.

56:45.600 --> 56:46.400
You're right, Griffin.

56:46.400 --> 56:49.360
Not enough people make amends sort of online, you know?

56:49.920 --> 56:51.840
I just don't want to paint everybody on Yahoo Answers

56:51.840 --> 56:54.160
with the same big dumb brush.

56:54.160 --> 56:55.840
I posted the diarrhea questions on,

56:55.840 --> 56:56.800
like they're owning it.

56:56.800 --> 56:57.360
They own it.

56:57.360 --> 57:01.760
Is the diarrhea questions capitalized like the white,

57:01.760 --> 57:03.680
like is it like-

57:03.680 --> 57:05.920
Like the Panama, like the Panama papers?

57:05.920 --> 57:06.160
Yeah.

57:06.160 --> 57:06.880
Because she tapes?

57:07.600 --> 57:07.920
Yeah.

57:07.920 --> 57:09.360
Is this a thing that everyone,

57:09.360 --> 57:12.080
like when you say the diarrhea questions,

57:12.080 --> 57:13.440
you don't have to say like which ones

57:13.440 --> 57:14.640
because it's not some,

57:14.640 --> 57:16.000
it's the diarrhea questions.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.440
It's the diarrhea questions.

57:18.800 --> 57:19.920
I'm really sorry though.

57:19.920 --> 57:23.920
Listen, if this person's listening, I pardon you.

57:24.640 --> 57:25.440
You're pardoned.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.640
I feel like the three of us would be the ones to do that.

57:28.640 --> 57:30.800
I feel like we would have the legal ability

57:30.800 --> 57:32.560
to pardon people on Yahoo Answers.

57:33.920 --> 57:38.640
I hope that we get a fucking email from Marissa or Melissa,

57:38.640 --> 57:40.160
the owner of Yahoo,

57:40.160 --> 57:42.160
just like giving us like a one week heads up.

57:42.160 --> 57:44.560
Like, hey boys, I know how important this product is to you.

57:44.560 --> 57:46.320
Just wanted to give you a one week head up

57:46.320 --> 57:48.720
to like record all your Yahoo's videos.

57:48.720 --> 57:51.520
Record all your Yahoo's for stockpile them.

57:51.520 --> 57:53.920
Like take shelter and stockpile your shit.

57:53.920 --> 57:55.440
Screenshot the shit out of it

57:55.440 --> 57:57.760
and then build a house out of those screenshots.

57:57.760 --> 57:59.840
I kind of feel like our regulars

57:59.840 --> 58:01.760
need to start like field stripping,

58:01.760 --> 58:03.360
like conserving them.

58:03.360 --> 58:04.800
You know, like they need to start,

58:04.800 --> 58:06.640
like have a bunker full of Yahoo's.

58:06.640 --> 58:07.920
Just pickled Yahoo's, yeah.

58:08.640 --> 58:10.400
Yeah, they can keep stored.

58:11.040 --> 58:16.240
Listen folks, that's gonna do it for us on our podcast.

58:16.240 --> 58:18.240
My brother, my brother and me, this one.

58:18.240 --> 58:19.600
The one you're listening to.

58:19.600 --> 58:21.120
The 301.

58:21.760 --> 58:22.320
301.

58:23.280 --> 58:24.640
Thanks for listening.

58:25.440 --> 58:28.880
We have a lot of fun stuff coming up.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.720
We have a couple live shows that we can't announce yet,

58:32.720 --> 58:33.760
but they're soon.

58:34.320 --> 58:35.120
When are we gonna announce them?

58:35.120 --> 58:35.680
Like next week?

58:36.240 --> 58:37.920
I think next week.

58:37.920 --> 58:39.200
That sounds about right.

58:40.320 --> 58:41.200
Yeah.

58:41.200 --> 58:42.320
That's not a subtle hint.

58:42.320 --> 58:43.440
We're not going to Canada.

58:44.240 --> 58:44.720
Sorry.

58:44.720 --> 58:45.760
Yeah, yeah, no.

58:45.760 --> 58:47.840
I mean, we can say where we're going, right?

58:47.840 --> 58:48.320
No.

58:48.320 --> 58:49.040
But it's good.

58:49.040 --> 58:50.080
You're gonna love it.

58:50.080 --> 58:53.920
We can't say where we're Chicago.

58:53.920 --> 58:54.880
We're not doing Chicago, sorry.

58:54.880 --> 58:55.920
We're not going Chicago.

58:56.880 --> 58:57.760
No, we're not going there.

59:00.160 --> 59:02.960
But we're gonna announce, it'll be two cities, big shows.

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:06.240
Okay.

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.520
You can't be burning through them

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:08.080
like you did last week.

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:08.880
You're right, you're right, you're right.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:10.160
This is like a finite thing.

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:11.440
Aaron Keys sent this one.

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.000
Thanks, Aaron.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.440
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:14.080
They're anonymous,

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.920
but they did ask this important query.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.360
Can I still vape when I have walking pneumonia?

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.440
Gotta have my vape.

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:27.360
My name's Justin McElroy.

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:28.560
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.760
I'm Griffith McElroy.

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.960
He's been my brother, my brother and me.

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:31.760
Kiss your dad.

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:42.000
Square on the lips.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.920
Maximumfun.org.

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:52.960

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.080
Artist owned.

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:55.200
Listener supported.

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:57.680
The three of you went to a cave of a big red dragon

01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:01.360
and is standing over a hoard of precious golden rubies.

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.600
And he says, what do you do adventures?

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:04.800
I'm a dragon man.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:05.680
I cast fire on him.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.560
It's very good.

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:08.480
I address the red dragon to say,

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.560
us, we're the hosts of the Adventure Zone,

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.760
a podcast about family playing Dungeons and Dragons.

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:14.880
Very good synergy.

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:15.680
Commit to the bit.

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.280
I roll to charm new listeners.

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:22.160
It is very effective against all odds.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.120
Everybody, we're the McElroys.

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:24.160
We host the Adventure Zones,

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.160
a podcast where we play Dungeons and Dragons together.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.520
It's a comedy podcast.

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:28.880
We don't take the rules too seriously

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:29.920
because there's a lot of them

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:31.280
and we did not take the time to learn them.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.000
Maybe listen to us.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.640
We come out every other Thursday on the Maximum Fun Network.

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:37.360
You can find us on iTunes or on Maximumfun.org.

01:02:37.360 --> 01:03:03.920
I think this promo is a critical hit.
