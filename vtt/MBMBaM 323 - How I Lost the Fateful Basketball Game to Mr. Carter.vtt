00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:46.960
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother and my brother made an advice show for the

00:46.960 --> 00:51.360
modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-aged brother Travis

00:51.360 --> 00:56.240
McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy, don't you know? We did it America.

00:56.240 --> 01:02.000
Yeah, we did it everybody. Yeah, I don't know that this is necessarily good intro fodder,

01:02.000 --> 01:08.160
like obviously I'm happy that we did a television show, and to be back home with all of my

01:09.040 --> 01:15.760
novelty coffee mugs and my wife and stuff, but all we really did was work for three weeks.

01:16.640 --> 01:23.760
What? How are people doing it out there day to day? We get so many emails from people and it's

01:23.760 --> 01:28.640
like life is really hard for me right now. Thank you all for being such a shining light in that

01:29.600 --> 01:35.760
hard time and they always find those emails very confusing because it's like no, life is very easy.

01:35.760 --> 01:41.520
It's very easy and good. You do like an hour of work and then people listen to it and it's good

01:41.520 --> 01:46.320
and you're good baby. And it's good, like you do one hour of work, like that's almost a break

01:46.320 --> 01:54.640
from the leisure, you know? But like this thing we did with the TV show, working every day is

01:54.640 --> 02:01.760
honestly, it's taken a genuine toll on me sort of physio spiritually.

02:01.760 --> 02:07.360
Yeah, the other day I came out of the HQ where we were filming and I was walking down the street

02:07.360 --> 02:11.760
and this construction worker who was like just covered in dirt and dust and he'd been

02:11.760 --> 02:17.840
jackhammering all day. He looked at me and he said, you poor soul, do you need to sit down

02:17.840 --> 02:21.360
for a second? Do you need to take a break? And I said, thank you so much. And he said,

02:21.360 --> 02:24.320
I don't need this water as much as you do. And he gave me his water.

02:24.880 --> 02:26.160
That was cool of him.

02:26.160 --> 02:32.480
Yeah, I think he just recognized how hard I had been working and I really appreciated it.

02:33.520 --> 02:40.960
I heard the song Five O'Clock Somewhere and I never understood why all the excitement.

02:40.960 --> 02:47.280
And then I finally got it. But get this gang, sometimes we weren't done by five.

02:47.280 --> 02:52.480
Which is crazy. We would say it's five o'clock somewhere, but it would be in a mournful tone

02:52.480 --> 02:57.920
because it was 10 where we were and we still had to work. And we did six episodes of this

02:57.920 --> 03:04.880
television show and it took three weeks and I almost died. Hey, Frasier, how'd you do it?

03:04.880 --> 03:11.440
Cause you did a billion episodes, Kelsey. You did a billion episodes Kelsey and as far as I can tell,

03:11.440 --> 03:13.680
you're okay. You're fine.

03:13.680 --> 03:20.720
I cannot begin to convey to the audience listening how often during this process

03:20.720 --> 03:22.480
we talked about Frasier.

03:22.480 --> 03:26.240
Well, because it's unthinkable, Travis, what Kelsey accomplished.

03:26.240 --> 03:36.160
Well, I will say this. In our defense, Kelsey had a bunch of people helping him make up the jokes

03:36.160 --> 03:42.400
and the three of us just had only about four or five other people to help us create the jokes.

03:42.400 --> 03:46.640
Each one of them was worth three people. So that's 12 to 15.

03:46.640 --> 03:46.960
Easily.

03:46.960 --> 03:52.880
But here's what you don't know. Not a lot of people know this. The writing staff on Frasier, 123 people.

03:52.880 --> 03:59.520
That's amazing. There was a year there where Will Smith legally was in every movie.

04:00.400 --> 04:03.040
And he was also writing for Frasier.

04:03.040 --> 04:08.800
He's writing for Frasier and also he put out a Big Willy style or Wilinium. How did you do that, bud?

04:09.440 --> 04:14.000
I would love to see the pictures of Will Smith on set for Independence Day. And in one hand,

04:14.000 --> 04:19.120
he's got a pen writing Big Willy style. And in his left hand, he's got a pen writing Frasier

04:19.120 --> 04:26.000
because he's ambidextrous and can write a hit musical album and a great script about how

04:26.000 --> 04:31.920
like Niles is super in love with Daphne, like at the same time.

04:31.920 --> 04:34.400
Making fun of a certain type of wine.

04:34.400 --> 04:38.320
What you didn't know about Will Smith is that in every movie he is in,

04:38.880 --> 04:47.600
there is always a comfortable king size bed just directly off frame that he lays down in and goes

04:47.600 --> 04:52.640
hard to sleep between every take. So it's literally like, you know the difference between you and me?

04:52.640 --> 04:58.240
I make this look good. Just falls down and it's just like full Huey Dewey Louie.

05:00.240 --> 05:01.520
Snoring like a swan.

05:01.520 --> 05:05.040
A feather raising up and down over his mouth as he snores.

05:05.040 --> 05:05.840
Yes, absolutely.

05:05.840 --> 05:13.040
The hard thing is getting him into the nightgown because it often covers his microphone.

05:13.040 --> 05:19.040
Well, he's got a Rawls and Gromit-esque machine that basically cut door open.

05:19.040 --> 05:25.760
He falls through hands, hands, clothes, shirt, nightshirt, cap, and then feather over lips.

05:25.760 --> 05:30.000
He breathes. It goes up and down. And then it's like, OK, well, we're back.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.120
Bed springs him back up. He goes through his costume and now he's suddenly just fully dressed

05:35.120 --> 05:39.360
for it. And now he's back to making Hancock. You know what I mean? That's his day.

05:39.360 --> 05:46.800
My initial revelation upon making a TV show for three weeks was that I needed to be nicer to

05:46.800 --> 05:54.160
everybody who had made a TV show before because it's so hard. But I think maybe what I mean is

05:54.160 --> 06:00.480
anybody who has a job to work. Like if you do a job every day, like my blessings to you,

06:00.480 --> 06:06.080
Effendi, because that is a very difficult gig you got going. And by which I mean any job.

06:06.080 --> 06:08.400
Any jobs that require

06:08.400 --> 06:17.440
consistent amounts of work. Do you think when a new Hollywood it girl or boy is like starting to

06:17.440 --> 06:22.480
come up, they have a like when Chris Pratt did Guardians of the Galaxy and it was like, well,

06:22.480 --> 06:25.840
he's in everything now. Do you think he had a moment after Guardians where he was like,

06:27.040 --> 06:32.080
oh, God, like he saw it sort of like a tall wave about to crash down on him?

06:32.080 --> 06:37.520
Like, oh, Jesus, God, no, I got too much heat. I'm too buzzy. I got too much heat. I gotta go.

06:37.520 --> 06:39.120
I gotta go.

06:39.120 --> 06:43.280
It's like when a spaceship like re-enters the atmosphere. You know what I mean? Like

06:43.280 --> 06:46.480
you start picking up speed towards the earth and like those just

06:46.480 --> 06:50.000
flame waves start emanating from in front of Chris Pratt's face.

06:51.200 --> 06:54.000
He was doing like 10 movies. And then he was also in Jurassic World,

06:54.000 --> 06:57.120
which is like the biggest movie ever. And then when he did Jurassic World, they're like,

06:57.120 --> 06:59.920
you know, dog, we're going to make eight more of these, right? And you're in all of them.

06:59.920 --> 07:06.080
He's like, oh, Jesus, God, Jesus, what I do. How about let's get into stuff. Thank you.

07:06.080 --> 07:09.120
If you work a full time job, hats off to you.

07:09.120 --> 07:14.240
I also want to say I love you, brother, so much. But I'm also really glad we're all in

07:14.240 --> 07:15.280
different rooms now.

07:15.280 --> 07:20.320
Oh, man. Yeah, I had to watch you guys eat so many meals. And that's my least favorite of the things.

07:20.320 --> 07:25.280
I love so many things about you. But watching your faces while we record podcasts is not one

07:25.280 --> 07:25.680
of them.

07:25.680 --> 07:27.760
It really stinks.

07:27.760 --> 07:33.360
I really feel like I've reunited with my two best podcast buddies after they were replaced

07:33.360 --> 07:35.280
by pod people for three weeks.

07:35.280 --> 07:38.640
Fantasy Justin and Fantasy Griffin are two of my favorite people in the world.

07:38.640 --> 07:42.720
Yeah, my favorite thing about fantasy microphone Travis and Justin is that they don't need to

07:42.720 --> 07:49.840
eat. They just sort of subsist on like making internet jokes. And so they don't they don't

07:49.840 --> 07:54.080
have to eat food. And I don't have to hear or see that happen. It's a real it's really

07:54.080 --> 07:54.960
delightful.

07:54.960 --> 07:58.880
People ask us, how do you guys keep such good relationships? I'm not that close to my brother

07:58.880 --> 08:07.360
and sister. The answer, if I take my headphones off, they disappear.

08:07.360 --> 08:08.320
Here's our first question.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.040
Yeah.

08:09.040 --> 08:13.920
I haven't seen one of my best friends in two years. She lives in Texas. I live in New York.

08:13.920 --> 08:17.840
In a month, she'll be visiting D.C. and I'm going down to see her. But we'll be staying

08:17.840 --> 08:22.960
with a different friend who lives in D.C. How do I tell the D.C. friend I'm staying

08:22.960 --> 08:27.760
with that I want to spend time with my friend from Texas without my D.C. friend getting

08:27.760 --> 08:31.680
offended? Or is this a non-issue? I don't want her to feel like I'm visiting D.C. just

08:31.680 --> 08:34.000
to see my Texas friend. I'm excited to see both.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.400
That's from Troubled in Brooklyn.

08:37.040 --> 08:43.920
This is like so pertinent because like while we were in Huntington, goofing aside, like

08:43.920 --> 08:47.840
we were doing 12 hour days every day and I didn't have a lot of time to like get out

08:47.840 --> 08:53.120
and see folks. And that's not like it's not a burden to get out and see my friends. But

08:53.120 --> 08:57.920
it was it was it was tricky like trying to figure out the schedule on how to do that.

08:58.720 --> 09:03.360
But also, I mean, I also come in town to hang out with my family. And so it's it's hard to

09:03.360 --> 09:07.440
like say, OK, I'm going to take some time away from hanging with this group of people

09:07.440 --> 09:10.240
who I don't get to see very often to hang out with this group of people who I never

09:10.240 --> 09:15.520
get to see. It's a this is a this is a really tricky, tricky thing, especially if you're

09:15.520 --> 09:18.800
the type of person who like all of your friends have moved away or you moved away from all

09:18.800 --> 09:22.640
your friends. It can be it can be really difficult.

09:22.640 --> 09:28.800
I my question would be with these two friends get along because there's always the option

09:28.800 --> 09:33.760
of like making it an all inclusive thing. And rather than like looking at your friends

09:33.760 --> 09:38.160
you're staying with and saying like, OK, well, I'll see you again in six hours. Like

09:38.160 --> 09:41.760
say, hey, my friend and I are going to the museum. Do you want to go?

09:41.760 --> 09:45.600
But that that can be so bad if they're not if they are not friends in the way that

09:46.240 --> 09:50.160
you and the other person are friends. Like it's it's going to be weird because you're

09:50.160 --> 09:55.520
going to want to like if I wanted to hang out with like one of my old Huntington friends

09:56.560 --> 10:01.680
while I was staying with like one of my Chicago friends, like I and I saw my Huntington friend

10:01.680 --> 10:04.640
and I didn't you know, I haven't seen them in a while. And when I catch up, we would

10:04.640 --> 10:08.640
probably talk about a bunch of shit that the Chicago friend wouldn't get and vice versa.

10:08.640 --> 10:13.440
Not not that like we have a secret language, secret friendship language. But but you know

10:13.440 --> 10:18.080
what I mean? Like that can also be that can also be very you can really ostracize one

10:18.080 --> 10:24.400
of the people if you if you do it like that. Yeah, but the difference between like Airbnb

10:24.400 --> 10:29.680
with someone and staying with a friend is that you hang out with them. So like if your friend

10:29.680 --> 10:34.800
is letting you stay in their home and then you basically just like only see them in the morning

10:34.800 --> 10:40.480
before you go out to do other things and only see them at night when you come home and go to sleep,

10:40.480 --> 10:43.280
like that's not you're kind of taking advantage of it, you know?

10:43.280 --> 10:49.520
I tell me if I'm wrong, brothers, because I and I know that we are not a good sample size because

10:49.520 --> 10:57.680
we are alike in many ways. But for me, my assumption is no one has ever had someone stay

10:57.680 --> 11:04.480
with them from out of town. And not at least some point thought, man, I hope they plan some things

11:04.480 --> 11:10.240
to do. Yeah, this is exactly right. Yeah, like absolutely right. Nobody can handle the pressure

11:10.240 --> 11:16.320
of like trying to make sure that you're having a good time constantly. Like that would be I don't

11:16.320 --> 11:21.440
think anybody actually wants that. Not only that, depending on the length of your stay, you're

11:21.440 --> 11:27.280
probably going to hit a point where they will want some some alone time. I am so not offended

11:27.280 --> 11:30.720
by this. Like when I have friends who come in and stay with us while they're in Austin, like

11:31.360 --> 11:36.080
I'm I'm happy to put them up and then I get to hang out with them at our house, which is my

11:36.080 --> 11:42.800
favorite place to hang out because it's where all my novelty coffee mugs is. But I don't I don't get

11:42.800 --> 11:48.400
offended when they want to go and do other stuff, especially if it's stuff I don't want to do, like

11:48.400 --> 11:53.840
hang out with your dumb friend. Yeah, I would say that the key is to find the balance of like, it

11:53.840 --> 11:58.400
can't be the first day you get there. It can't be like if you get in Friday night, you spend all day

11:58.400 --> 12:08.720
with friend number two, but like number two. But that like, you know, you find a good balance and

12:08.720 --> 12:12.720
you make sure you're not shortchanging one friend to hang out with the other, especially if they've

12:12.720 --> 12:18.400
opened their home up to you. Yeah, but yeah, I agree. It's always okay to find a little bit of

12:18.400 --> 12:26.160
time. One other side note, you're going from New York to D.C. That's three hours. That's about 45

12:26.160 --> 12:32.080
minutes. Deepest Congo. It's not like a once in a lifetime. Yeah. Eat, pray, love style journey

12:32.080 --> 12:37.360
to India together. Like you're going to you're taking a train. You're like, you can come back

12:37.360 --> 12:44.320
tomorrow. The train costs four dollars. Like it's unacceptable. You're fine. Just go back later if

12:44.320 --> 12:49.120
their butter. How about I like I do like that you and your friend from Texas are doing like a

12:49.120 --> 12:53.680
Centralia, Pennsylvania thing. Yeah, I'm like neither one of you wants to travel to New York

12:53.680 --> 12:59.760
or Texas, but you'll meet in the middle in D.C. I think that's fun. How about this Yahoo? It's

13:00.400 --> 13:06.160
from sending by Dan Green. Thank you, Dan. It's by Yahoo answers user human animal. It's posted

13:06.160 --> 13:13.840
in pregnancy and parenting, newborn and baby, which is not accurate. But they said, what do bees

13:13.840 --> 13:22.480
use honey for? Is it their food? That's it. No further additional details. And before I go any

13:22.480 --> 13:26.800
further into like the really entertaining part of this, just curious if you guys have any sort

13:26.800 --> 13:33.920
of initial thoughts on what bees are doing with that good sticky stuff in there. Yes, it's food

13:33.920 --> 13:40.480
for their babies, I believe. They get the just like, let's let's let's sort of just like lay out

13:41.040 --> 13:46.320
sort of how planet earth stuff. So there's the queen bee and she's like, go get me that pollen

13:46.320 --> 13:51.840
sun. And so they go out and they do get her that pollen sun. Well, it would actually be pollen

13:51.840 --> 13:57.600
daughter, because I believe only worker bees are all female. No one. That's no one. So anyway,

13:58.160 --> 14:03.040
maybe worker bees are male. And then the fighter bees are female. Really knows how that works. So

14:03.040 --> 14:08.880
let's not big bad beetleborgs are all male, right? No, I think there was I think there was a woman

14:08.880 --> 14:16.480
one. Shit. Shit. So anyway, bees have, I guess, mad hair on their thorax. And they just sort of

14:16.480 --> 14:22.080
rub up in the pollen, bring that home. The pollen somehow, hmm, this is where this is where things

14:22.080 --> 14:26.000
get a little bit crazy, because no one is quite sure what happens in the hive. They put it into

14:26.000 --> 14:33.280
like oak barrels, I think. Yeah, like an agent. And they choose a perfection. Yeah, they go out. And

14:33.280 --> 14:38.800
if I remember from the movie bugs life, they come back. And they go through basically what equates

14:38.800 --> 14:44.160
to a carwash that then like scrubs the pond off of them and turns it into honey, if I remember

14:44.160 --> 14:48.640
correctly, based on what I remember from a bee movie, they get the pollen, they bring it back,

14:49.280 --> 14:54.880
they tell some really funny jokes, and then they fuck a human woman. If I remember correctly,

14:54.880 --> 15:02.160
if I remember correct, so the honey, once they have the honey, do they eat the pollen? Or do

15:02.160 --> 15:08.400
they eat the honey? Is the honey just sort of a Griffin flower? Do you eat bread? This is an

15:08.400 --> 15:12.640
excellent point. But like, does that mean every time we crack open one of those big places,

15:12.640 --> 15:17.840
we are essentially smashing in their home and being like, hello? Oh, what is this bee food? You

15:17.840 --> 15:22.000
need this to live? Delightful. I'll have all of it. Scrape, scrape, scrape. We're all having a lot

15:22.000 --> 15:28.240
of fun here, but it's their dookie, right? Like honey is bee dookie? It could be. Another thing

15:28.240 --> 15:37.760
I'm worried about. I feel like this is the most like rote line of comedic thinking that maybe

15:37.760 --> 15:42.720
exists at this point, but in this particular instance, I think it's worth talking about. I

15:42.720 --> 15:49.840
want to know who the discoverer of honey was, right? Like this joke is played, like the first

15:49.840 --> 15:55.200
person to suck a cow's teeth was like, this is good. I'll have this. This is called milk. That's

15:55.200 --> 16:03.040
play, but it really is quite insane that somebody was like, what is this? Bugs live in here?

16:03.040 --> 16:10.640
Bugs that have needles on them full of poison, and also there's a million of them. I'm going to eat

16:10.640 --> 16:16.560
whatever I find in there. Hello. I can't exactly what happened, Griffin. Somebody saw a hungry old

16:16.560 --> 16:23.120
bear getting himself a smackerel of honey. That's what happened. Look at that sticky mess on that

16:23.120 --> 16:28.720
bear's maw. That looks delicious. I want to get myself a smackerel of honey. So they grab the bear

16:28.720 --> 16:34.320
and they pin it to the ground. They lick the honey up the face. Exactly. The bear was like,

16:34.320 --> 16:39.600
what are you doing? No, please stop. It would be very scary if you were the bear.

16:41.120 --> 16:46.880
I'm just going to read some answers now. Yahoo Answers user anonymous says, yes,

16:46.880 --> 16:53.040
honey is their food. Okay. One person suggests that they use honey to lure humans in to remove

16:53.040 --> 16:57.600
it from their hive by cutting that part of the hive off, and then they put it in a bucket and

16:57.600 --> 17:07.520
sell it in town. I think they're suggesting that bees work together with humans to like,

17:07.520 --> 17:14.000
oh, I hate this part of the hive. I want it to get removed. Let's create a literal honey pot scenario

17:14.000 --> 17:18.800
where a person comes in and helps us break apart the parts of our hive that we don't want anymore.

17:18.800 --> 17:25.760
Can you imagine if an insect was like that aware of humans to that level? Like if an ant was like,

17:25.760 --> 17:30.800
you know what? I hate this old anthill we've got. Let's go attack that picnic so people will come

17:30.800 --> 17:36.720
over and destroy it and then we can build a new one. So I mean, going down here though,

17:37.280 --> 17:42.160
someone says nectar from flowers is food for bees. They make honey. They don't use it for food.

17:42.160 --> 17:46.880
They don't use it for food. Honey is made from pollen and nectar for winter. As we can food for

17:46.880 --> 17:52.080
the winter, they prefer fresh food like we do. So which one is it? No, I don't think anybody

17:52.080 --> 17:56.640
knows what honey is. I don't think anybody knows what honey is all about, but we're eating it every

17:56.640 --> 18:04.880
day. The best answer I can find is the worst. It's the pits. Oh no. Bees fly around. Okay.

18:05.520 --> 18:10.480
And then they gobble up the honey. Okay. Right. But they store it. They gobble up the nectar,

18:10.480 --> 18:16.000
right? Yeah. And they store it in a special tummy just for nectar. Good. That's fine. Then

18:16.000 --> 18:22.720
when we get back to the hive, they barf it up. Yes. But it's wet. So other bees flap their wings

18:22.720 --> 18:29.760
to dry it until it's delicious honey. Damn bees, that's a lot of work. Wait,

18:29.760 --> 18:34.960
where's the wax come from then? Where's the wax come from? Another unanswered question. And why

18:34.960 --> 18:40.720
do they need all this fucking wax and honey? How are they flavoring it? How are they flavoring it?

18:40.720 --> 18:47.520
How do they make it honey flavor? Bees, thank you. Thank you, bees. Because you make shit that you

18:47.520 --> 18:54.320
don't need and probably don't even want. But I want it very much, bees. Thank you. This is excellent

18:54.320 --> 18:58.960
work you're doing. With all this wax and honey in there, I bet it's real sexy in a beehive.

18:59.520 --> 19:05.120
Yeah. Spiders make silk, right? But they need that shit to make their webs and shit. That's fine.

19:05.120 --> 19:09.360
Bees are making wax. Bees are making honey. I don't even think they know what they're doing.

19:09.360 --> 19:13.040
I don't think we spent enough time talking about how sexy it is in the beehive, Griffin. Can we

19:13.040 --> 19:18.560
go back to just talking about like super sexy erotic- Oh, just tight fucking wet sticky quarters.

19:19.120 --> 19:24.560
Just a bunch of- I mean, there's only one person getting laid, right? And that's the queen, right?

19:24.560 --> 19:33.840
I think that's it. And she makes the larvae. What? No, they give royal jelly to one of the larvae

19:33.840 --> 19:39.280
and it eats it and it becomes the queen. It's a mega vitamin that gives it super

19:39.280 --> 19:44.720
powers and it turns into the queen. Or you could put it on your face. That's another option.

19:45.680 --> 19:52.160
Boy, I bet that is unoffensive to bees. Yeah. I'd rather you did it, Hooman.

19:54.320 --> 19:59.440
Bees have it rough, but also they nasty. Bees are quite nasty just barfing on each

19:59.440 --> 20:06.400
other and fucking nonstop and like shitting out stuff that I love. I love your shit, bees.

20:06.400 --> 20:10.000
And I'm sorry that you're like disappearing or whatever. Actually, is that even a thing?

20:10.000 --> 20:14.080
I don't hear about that so much anymore. I guess we solved it. Oh, they're back.

20:14.080 --> 20:17.840
Oh, they're back. Good. We solved it. What did we do? Can we do that for the other animals?

20:20.480 --> 20:24.480
I think we just asked the bees, like, where'd they go? Did they see anybody else there that

20:24.480 --> 20:29.680
we should get? Oh, did they go? They went somewhere to hide for a bit,

20:29.680 --> 20:32.640
but then they came back and we're like, no, we're good. Stop freaking out.

20:32.640 --> 20:38.800
Everybody chill. Hey humans, it's fine. We had to go to our home planet to defend it.

20:38.800 --> 20:42.480
We had to do, we did a quick sort of workplace retreat to like,

20:42.480 --> 20:48.240
determine what we're doing vis-a-vis honey and wax. Cause we hate the stuff. We hate this stuff.

20:48.240 --> 20:52.000
Hey, why are we making all this stuff? I don't know. Didn't, I thought you said,

20:52.000 --> 20:55.760
Noah, I thought you said we were supposed to make, wait, hold on. Does anyone know why

20:55.760 --> 20:59.920
we're making this stuff? Yeah. Steve, do you know why we're making honey?

20:59.920 --> 21:05.040
I hate all this sticky stuff. Recently, a new employee joined my workplace

21:05.040 --> 21:09.760
when another coworker described something as tasting like pineapple. The new employee

21:09.760 --> 21:13.360
claimed he didn't know what that meant as he had never tasted pineapple before.

21:13.360 --> 21:20.320
How does this happen to adults? His explanation was that he had no pineapple

21:20.320 --> 21:23.920
available where he grew up, but he is from central Illinois.

21:23.920 --> 21:28.800
Eat a fruit salad, motherfucker. The Midwest is not exactly the forefront

21:28.800 --> 21:33.680
of tropical cuisine, but pineapple is literally everywhere in American cuisine.

21:33.680 --> 21:36.560
Further, he admitted he has never tried a peach or a pear.

21:39.360 --> 21:44.560
Amazingly, he has tried and likes papayas. So it's not just fruits that begin with the letter P.

21:45.280 --> 21:49.600
It also, it also is not that he doesn't like how they taste as he's never,

21:50.160 --> 21:55.680
honestly, truly never tried them. Is there a tactful way to convince him to give these foods

21:55.680 --> 22:01.280
a chance? Other advice for helping him develop a basic flavor literacy in classic American fruits?

22:01.280 --> 22:04.960
And that's from fruit salad fan in Winston-Salem. How does this happen?

22:04.960 --> 22:08.240
How does this happen? That's so many different types of fruits you haven't eaten.

22:09.280 --> 22:12.560
Do you think that maybe it's the kind of thing where like this person

22:12.560 --> 22:18.240
has actually had these fruits before and just like had no idea that that's what a pineapple is?

22:20.000 --> 22:24.640
I mean, you're saying he ate a pineapple but didn't know it was a pineapple?

22:24.640 --> 22:30.880
Oh, I'm saying like that he's had a fruit salad, that he's like had some like Hawaiian style pizza

22:30.880 --> 22:35.840
and just never registered. Because here's the thing. I, after, let's say that this person is

22:35.840 --> 22:42.320
30 years old. In 30 years of living in America, the odds that a pineapple has not accidentally

22:42.320 --> 22:46.720
made its way into this person's gob- Has it infiltrated?

22:46.720 --> 22:47.120
Right? Yeah.

22:48.080 --> 22:50.560
Like the person has had it. Yeah.

22:50.560 --> 22:55.760
Yeah. My, I'm more offended by this person treating an object as exotic,

22:55.760 --> 22:59.600
which you can get on a pizza at Papa John's. Yes.

22:59.600 --> 23:04.240
Like how, how dare you? It's not fucking 1658

23:04.240 --> 23:08.480
and you just learned about this like mythical fruit from the new world.

23:09.040 --> 23:14.240
Yeah. And that's exactly the line of thing. Like, oh, we don't have pineapples in Illinois.

23:14.240 --> 23:18.560
You mean the state where Chicago is? They wicked do have them there.

23:18.560 --> 23:22.640
Not just that. They do have them there. The state where grocery stores are.

23:22.640 --> 23:26.960
Like pineapples are pretty much available year round in any grocery store.

23:26.960 --> 23:33.280
You're right. My point was fallacious that they would only have pineapples in Chicago

23:33.280 --> 23:38.320
and not in the rest of it. Yeah. You probably could get some in like Aurora, I would imagine.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.920
And a peach and a pear. My dude, that's so many fruits.

23:43.920 --> 23:46.080
That's so many good fruits. A pear especially.

23:46.080 --> 23:49.200
That pear is less and less exotic as you go down. Even a peach,

23:49.200 --> 23:52.400
you could say, well, it's not the right temperature.

23:52.400 --> 23:58.400
A pear is just a mellow, just smooth apple. That's all a pear is.

23:58.400 --> 24:04.080
It's a mellow, flunky, smooth apple. It's a chill sort of apple with a fucked up shape.

24:04.080 --> 24:08.560
What it is basically for a pear is it's basically a jazz apple.

24:08.560 --> 24:10.000
Yeah. If you think about it,

24:10.000 --> 24:14.400
a pear is just an apple that's smoothed out and it's not going to have a bunch of bite,

24:14.400 --> 24:17.680
a little softer chew. I could go for a bear right now.

24:17.680 --> 24:20.240
A peach is just a sassy fucking plum, isn't it?

24:20.880 --> 24:23.200
Yeah. That's what I've always said.

24:23.200 --> 24:27.360
Let me bite into this plum. The color is so bright and vibrant and it's a little bit tart.

24:27.360 --> 24:30.960
Yeah, that's right. Watch out. I got a pit. Don't chip a tooth.

24:31.680 --> 24:36.480
I don't understand how you see an object we call a pineapple.

24:36.480 --> 24:42.480
You see someone slice it in half with a machete and then you are not immediately thinking,

24:42.480 --> 24:44.480
I have got to savor what's inside of that.

24:46.880 --> 24:49.600
I've got to eat that most appetizing inner meat.

24:52.080 --> 24:57.040
If I were you, I would just set down a plate in front of this person with one slice of pineapple,

24:57.040 --> 25:00.880
one slice of peach, one slice of pear, and just stare at them and say,

25:00.880 --> 25:02.320
eat it. Eat it.

25:02.320 --> 25:08.320
And don't walk away until they do because you will never rest knowing that there's a human

25:08.320 --> 25:14.960
being walking the face of this earth who has on purpose not ever had these fruits.

25:14.960 --> 25:19.440
This is all you will think about from now until time immemorial if you don't resolve.

25:19.440 --> 25:23.280
Maybe they were handed a whole pineapple and they thought, well,

25:23.280 --> 25:27.680
what am I supposed to do with this? There's no way. It's impossible.

25:27.680 --> 25:32.080
Look at the spines, the leaves. How do people eat these things?

25:32.080 --> 25:35.040
I'm throwing this in the trash. Is that possible?

25:35.040 --> 25:44.400
Now, I'm thinking, boys, and I'm real worried that I have a similar gap in my food education.

25:45.280 --> 25:47.920
I'm worried. I'm thinking. I don't think I do.

25:47.920 --> 25:54.240
This thing mentioned papayas. We had a sick Roshana party last night and somebody brought

25:54.240 --> 25:57.280
papayas and I didn't eat one. And now I'm thinking about it.

25:57.280 --> 26:00.480
Like, did I not eat one because I'm somehow afraid of papayas?

26:00.480 --> 26:02.320
Because I don't think I've ever had one of those.

26:02.320 --> 26:06.560
I don't think that's as, that's not as crazy, I don't think, as pineapple peach pear.

26:06.560 --> 26:12.720
But it's definitely not. Okay, here's, I'll tell you.

26:12.720 --> 26:18.080
This is my general rule. If it is a fruit that the average person

26:18.080 --> 26:24.240
standing in a supermarket would look at and be unable to identify just from seeing it

26:24.240 --> 26:30.320
out and about in the world on TV and movies and such, then it is okay if you haven't tried it.

26:30.320 --> 26:34.080
If you see that little yellow motherfucker that's all spiny and bumpy and you're like,

26:34.080 --> 26:36.720
I don't know what this is, that's perfectly fine.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.920
If you look at a pear and you're like, oh, what is this?

26:40.560 --> 26:43.040
What is this? Oh, what? Huh?

26:43.040 --> 26:48.480
Like, that's not okay. If you have to Google how to eat it,

26:48.480 --> 26:51.680
then I don't think it's an issue if you have not tried it.

26:51.680 --> 26:55.680
But like, was this person watching SpongeBob SquarePants and he's like,

26:55.680 --> 26:57.520
what's this house made out of? I don't understand.

26:57.520 --> 27:00.560
What a fanciful cartoon. What a wonderful fantasy world

27:00.560 --> 27:03.440
that they've whipped up for us. What a spiny grass house

27:03.440 --> 27:06.400
you've made for yourself, living sponge. That's a fun fake fruit.

27:06.400 --> 27:10.000
What a wonderful imagination you have, Nickelodeon. What will they think of next?

27:11.760 --> 27:17.440
I just don't, I don't, I don't understand how we get,

27:17.440 --> 27:20.640
I don't understand how we get there. Pineapples is good as fuck.

27:20.640 --> 27:24.160
Pineapples is the best fruit. That's the other thing,

27:24.160 --> 27:28.080
is that if I'm gonna eat like a big luscious chunk of fruit,

27:28.080 --> 27:30.640
I always want it to be a pineapple. I always want it to be a pineapple.

27:31.360 --> 27:34.560
Of course. Obviously. Obviously, of course.

27:34.560 --> 27:49.680
Clearly. This week's first sponsor is Club W.

27:50.720 --> 27:52.640
Maybe you'd like to get deeper into wine,

27:52.640 --> 27:55.280
but you don't know where to start. And I cannot think of a better way

27:55.280 --> 27:58.000
of doing it than Club W. You don't need to know about wine

27:58.000 --> 28:01.280
to get the most out of this service. You're gonna log onto their website.

28:01.280 --> 28:07.440
You're gonna take a survey that explores your sort of taste preferences,

28:07.440 --> 28:10.960
not what kind of wines you like, but what sort of flavors you like.

28:10.960 --> 28:15.120

28:15.120 --> 28:19.200

and for our listeners, yes. If you order four or more bottles of wine,

28:36.960 --> 28:39.600
Club W is gonna pay for shipping. Hell yes.

28:40.400 --> 28:41.360
Hell- What?

28:41.360 --> 28:43.280
Yes. That's gotta be a misprint.

28:43.840 --> 28:45.520
No, you're right. Let me check it again.

28:45.520 --> 28:48.640
Yep, no. Club W will pay for shipping on orders of four bottles.

28:48.640 --> 28:50.080
It says it right there. That's wild.

28:50.080 --> 28:53.360
It's right there in front of me. Four bottles of wine is heavy.

28:53.360 --> 28:55.840
That's like, that's a lot to ship. Thank you, Club W.

28:55.840 --> 28:57.440
That's very generous. They're at least 100 pounds.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.600
Thank you. We don't deserve you, Club W.

29:00.560 --> 29:05.360

and get $20 off your first order right now. That's clubw.com slash my brother.

29:11.200 --> 29:13.840
I want to tell y'all about- Oh, oh, nope. You can't.

29:14.960 --> 29:17.120
I'm going to. Okay, fine.

29:17.120 --> 29:20.960
I want to tell y'all and all y'all about MeUndies.

29:20.960 --> 29:25.200
MeUndies is underwear. And you wear it and it feels amazing.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.640
Underwear, Griffin.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.680
Under- Where is it? Where is it under?

29:31.680 --> 29:32.560
Jesus, please, no.

29:33.440 --> 29:34.800
Is it under there?

29:34.800 --> 29:37.600
Oh, man. Please. Please.

29:37.600 --> 29:38.880
Please, Griffin.

29:38.880 --> 29:41.520
Um, so here's the deal. You wear underwear every day.

29:41.520 --> 29:44.160
At least most of us do. Time to try something better.

29:44.160 --> 29:47.280
MeUndies has created the world's most comfortable underwear.

29:47.280 --> 29:50.240
It's a blend of fabric that is three times softer than cotton.

29:50.240 --> 29:59.040
I cannot stress enough how important it is that you swaddle your junk in stuff that feels very good.

29:59.040 --> 30:02.320
And then it's one of those investments that you don't think about being important,

30:02.320 --> 30:06.960
but then you do it and you're like, this is the most important thing I've ever done.

30:06.960 --> 30:12.160
Because it's like you're- You know how like there's some doctors or chiropractors that say like,

30:12.160 --> 30:17.440
your spine is the center of everything and if you have any health problems, it just comes back to your back being dumb.

30:17.440 --> 30:23.040
I think the underwear stuff is the same thing. Like, oh man, I had a really hard day at work.

30:23.040 --> 30:32.480
Well, you wouldn't have if you had this awesome modal fabric just like, just hugging your stuff.

30:32.480 --> 30:35.280
So anyway, get your stuff hugged.

30:35.280 --> 30:40.480
For a limited time, MeUndies is offering 20% off your first order at MeUndies.com slash My Brother.

30:40.480 --> 30:44.800
If you don't love your first pair, it's free, but that's even a ridiculous thing to say.

30:44.800 --> 30:49.280
Just go to MeUndies.com slash My Brother, get 20% off your first order.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.680
Okay.

30:51.680 --> 30:53.280
Sure.

30:53.280 --> 30:57.840
I was talking to the audience, not so much to you guys, but I appreciate that you were dialed in there.

30:57.840 --> 31:01.200
I've got a question, I've got a message for Steven.

31:01.200 --> 31:07.840
It's from Erica, parentheses, boo boo kitty, and it says the F word.

31:07.840 --> 31:10.640
Say it Travis.

31:10.640 --> 31:12.640
Boo boo kitty fuck.

31:12.640 --> 31:15.600
Hi boo, happy birthday.

31:15.600 --> 31:17.360
Time to gross out the internet.

31:17.360 --> 31:21.120
You're my boo tea-licious boo bear and boo berry pie.

31:21.120 --> 31:24.800
You are my husband and best friend and I'm thankful for that every day.

31:24.800 --> 31:28.400
P.S. I love Griffin, Justin, and Travis equally.

31:28.400 --> 31:31.280
I also love Travis even more equally.

31:31.280 --> 31:33.760
And that message is for April 22nd.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.600
Oh my God.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.280
That's a rough one.

31:37.280 --> 31:40.880
That was six months ago.

31:40.880 --> 31:43.440
That's rough.

31:43.440 --> 31:45.360
We couldn't be worse on this one.

31:45.360 --> 31:46.480
We really wang this one.

31:46.480 --> 31:47.360
So anyway.

31:47.360 --> 31:53.280
We are actually just chronologically as far away from that day as we could on either side.

31:53.280 --> 31:55.360
Yes, it's rough stuff.

31:55.360 --> 32:02.640
That was, I think your instincts were right Erica, a pretty gross message.

32:02.640 --> 32:05.840
I'm very happy for the love that you have with Steven.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.120
For me, for Travis.

32:07.120 --> 32:11.840
And also me and Justin and Travis, but also Travis more equally.

32:11.840 --> 32:14.800
And happy birthday Steven.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.080
Soon.

32:16.080 --> 32:16.640
Soon.

32:16.640 --> 32:18.880
Happy birthday, it's coming up.

32:18.880 --> 32:25.200
I have a message here and it's from Elise and it's to Alex who says,

32:25.200 --> 32:29.200
I'm not sure when this message will air, but instead of getting all uptight,

32:29.200 --> 32:32.880
I think we should lean into it and change your birthday to the day the brothers read this.

32:32.880 --> 32:36.320
May 28th was getting old and it was time for a birthday makeover.

32:36.320 --> 32:40.800
Also, I thought you might like hearing, I love you little lek on your favorite podcast

32:40.800 --> 32:43.360
from your favorite brother, which I think is Justin.

32:43.360 --> 32:44.400
Anyway, happy 29th.

32:44.400 --> 32:45.920
I love you little lek.

32:45.920 --> 32:47.760
Anyway, happy 29th birthday lek.

32:47.760 --> 32:50.880
Love Elise and cats.

32:50.880 --> 32:56.160
So this one, I mean the birthday, May 28th, obviously we wang that a bit.

32:56.160 --> 32:59.760
The date that this message was aimed at was March 8th.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.120
Holy shit.

33:01.120 --> 33:03.680
That's five months from now.

33:03.680 --> 33:05.520
We did great.

33:05.520 --> 33:06.480
We did great.

33:06.480 --> 33:09.040
What happened to the, I feel like we've gotten a little bit better.

33:09.600 --> 33:13.040
This week we really just really wanged it and donged it.

33:13.040 --> 33:16.160
We really just wanged it all over the place.

33:16.160 --> 33:20.960
It was like the Jumbotron is our weekly time to feel bad about ourselves.

33:20.960 --> 33:24.320
And like, you don't get that feeling like you let people down enough.

33:24.320 --> 33:27.440
We have it scheduled into our show to make ourselves feel that way.

33:28.080 --> 33:30.480
So thank you for keeping us humble.

33:30.480 --> 33:32.240
The great questions of your life.

33:32.240 --> 33:34.560
The great questions of your life.

33:34.560 --> 33:36.240
Should you put ketchup on a hot dog?

33:36.240 --> 33:38.000
Should you put ketchup on a hot dog?

33:38.000 --> 33:40.480
Toilet paper over or under?

33:40.480 --> 33:41.600
Toilet paper.

33:41.600 --> 33:43.760
Star Wars or Star Trek?

33:43.760 --> 33:45.120
Star Wars or Star Trek?

33:45.120 --> 33:46.160
Fear not, my friends.

33:46.720 --> 33:49.600
Mark and Hal always reach the definitive answer.

33:49.600 --> 33:55.440
Simply listen to We Got This with Mark and Hal every Tuesday at 9 p.m. Pacific on Maximum Fun.

33:55.440 --> 33:56.560
We got this.

33:56.560 --> 33:58.960
Your better self is right around the corner.

33:58.960 --> 33:59.680
Namaste.

34:00.320 --> 34:02.880
I got a Yahoo here and it's from Brooks Oglesby.

34:02.880 --> 34:03.360
Thank you, Brooks.

34:03.360 --> 34:04.560
This is by Yahoo Answers user.

34:04.560 --> 34:05.680
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

34:05.680 --> 34:06.800
I'm going to call them.

34:10.080 --> 34:11.280
Leguizamo asks,

34:13.200 --> 34:18.400
what's a good Shaq-themed cocktail to mix for my New Year's Eve party tonight?

34:20.160 --> 34:24.800
What's a good Shaq-themed cocktail to mix for my New Year's Eve party tonight?

34:27.920 --> 34:30.960
What is a good Shaq-themed cocktail though?

34:30.960 --> 34:33.440
What's just like a good...

34:33.440 --> 34:34.320
Here's my...

34:34.320 --> 34:35.680
I have a suggestion.

34:35.680 --> 34:36.880
Oh, I've got one.

34:36.880 --> 34:38.480
Okay, I'll do mine first.

34:38.480 --> 34:40.320
Okay, just don't steal mine.

34:40.320 --> 34:48.320
You just put whatever liquid in a very, very, very, very big wide glass.

34:49.200 --> 34:53.200
And then I think the glass, you have to, before anybody can drink it,

34:53.200 --> 34:59.360
you knock the whole glass over and it falls down and it spills because it's clumsy and goofy

34:59.360 --> 35:01.120
and everybody has a really good laugh.

35:01.120 --> 35:02.960
But you never actually drink the fluid inside.

35:02.960 --> 35:06.080
You just spill it because it has like a funny tumble.

35:07.920 --> 35:09.200
Strawberry Shaq-ery.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.000
Maybe a Sazer Shaq.

35:14.320 --> 35:15.440
So these are just...

35:15.440 --> 35:20.240
Griffin, maybe instead of the super big glass, you go super tiny glass.

35:20.240 --> 35:27.920
So then you feel like how Shaq must feel when you have to interact with our everyday human objects.

35:27.920 --> 35:30.560
Every time, I mean, that's essentially what a shot is, right?

35:30.560 --> 35:34.000
When you take a shot out of a shot glass, that's how Shaq drinks every liquid.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.720
But before you drink it, you have to look at it

35:36.720 --> 35:38.800
and just wonder why the world isn't made for you.

35:39.600 --> 35:42.000
Do you think Shaq and Andre ever met up?

35:43.360 --> 35:45.920
Do you think Shaq and Andre the Giant ever met up and were like,

35:47.360 --> 35:50.000
oh, it's nice to meet, this is really nice to meet you.

35:50.560 --> 35:52.320
I am also very big.

35:52.320 --> 35:54.160
Yeah, I bet that they pout around a little bit.

35:54.160 --> 35:56.320
I don't know what the age difference is there.

35:56.320 --> 35:59.200
They would try to walk into a room at the same time and break the doorframe.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.800
Oh, that's really good and fun.

36:01.440 --> 36:02.720
That's always so fun.

36:02.720 --> 36:05.040
And they'd like laugh and laugh and laugh.

36:05.040 --> 36:07.200
All right, you guys repurposed other beverages

36:07.200 --> 36:09.120
and just sort of squeezed the name Shaq into it.

36:09.120 --> 36:11.760
I want an original beverage that we can mix up

36:11.760 --> 36:14.000
and then send to Shaq on Twitter and maybe he'll retweet it

36:14.000 --> 36:17.280
because he's got like 11 billion followers and people love his stuff.

36:18.560 --> 36:19.200
Okay, Griffin.

36:20.640 --> 36:21.760
I love Shaq.

36:21.760 --> 36:24.800
People are still crazy about this guy.

36:24.800 --> 36:26.320
That's what they should be.

36:26.320 --> 36:29.600
He seems like a wonderful giant human being.

36:29.600 --> 36:29.840
Yes.

36:31.040 --> 36:33.280
Griffin, if I were to make a drink called,

36:33.280 --> 36:34.800
and I want you to spin this off the dome,

36:34.800 --> 36:35.840
I don't want you to overthink it.

36:35.840 --> 36:37.040
Hell yeah, dude.

36:37.040 --> 36:41.280
I'm kind of a mixologist, so just let him have it.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.360
If I were gonna make a drink called the Kazam, what would I put in it?

36:45.920 --> 36:49.200
First off, you start off with some nice champagne,

36:49.200 --> 36:52.720
a Brut, something clear, bubbly and fun.

36:52.720 --> 36:56.640
And you fill a big, big, big, big, big mug with it, okay?

36:56.640 --> 36:58.240
Are you with me so far?

36:58.240 --> 37:00.400
And then what you're gonna do

37:00.400 --> 37:03.520
is you're gonna throw a bunch of hamburgers into the cup

37:04.160 --> 37:06.240
and it's gonna displace most of the fluid,

37:06.240 --> 37:08.400
but you gotta throw them from way up high,

37:08.400 --> 37:10.240
recreating the famous scene in Kazam

37:10.240 --> 37:12.640
where the boy who gets the genie powers

37:12.640 --> 37:14.800
wishes for a fast food rain shower.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.200
Hey boy, your wishes suck!

37:17.200 --> 37:19.200
Your wishes suck, Kazam boy!

37:20.400 --> 37:22.000
How did you do it that bad?

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
I want a credit card with infinite money on it

37:24.000 --> 37:25.920
so I can go buy fast food whenever I want.

37:25.920 --> 37:27.520
Nope, didn't have that thought, did you?

37:27.520 --> 37:31.040
No, the thought that you had was I want to litter the whole city

37:31.040 --> 37:32.720
with French fries and burgers.

37:33.680 --> 37:36.080
Because who doesn't want to eat that off the ground?

37:37.200 --> 37:41.520
And also, Public Works is gonna have a really, really bad month

37:41.520 --> 37:43.200
trying to get all that stuff up.

37:43.200 --> 37:46.000
And I also want to say that it's just a great example

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
of how little we're doing to educate our children

37:48.000 --> 37:49.840
on proper wish making

37:49.840 --> 37:53.920
because this little motherfucker wishes for fast food to the sky.

37:54.560 --> 37:57.760
Don't use idioms in your wishes, folks,

37:57.760 --> 37:59.600
because they will be taken littery,

37:59.600 --> 38:02.160
and you'll, like if you said, I want a million bucks,

38:02.160 --> 38:03.760
you're gonna end up with a million deers.

38:03.760 --> 38:04.800
You know what I mean?

38:04.800 --> 38:07.440
What do you think would go in a Kazam cocktail?

38:08.480 --> 38:08.960
I'm so glad you asked that.

38:08.960 --> 38:10.080
You drink it out of a lamp.

38:10.640 --> 38:11.520
Justin, are you okay?

38:11.520 --> 38:12.800
You sound like you're dying.

38:12.800 --> 38:15.760
I got choked up, but listen, you drink it out of a lamp.

38:16.720 --> 38:17.680
Oh wait, I've got it.

38:17.680 --> 38:20.640
You put, just fill a lamp with Goldschlager

38:21.600 --> 38:24.240
because it's got the swirly like gold sparkles in there.

38:25.280 --> 38:26.320
Oh, oh my God.

38:27.680 --> 38:28.960
I know what you would do.

38:31.120 --> 38:34.160
I think this is a, you know how they make story cocktails?

38:34.160 --> 38:37.040
And these are cocktails that sort of evolve over time

38:38.480 --> 38:42.480
and they evolve over time to like recreate the story of a film.

38:43.280 --> 38:44.560
Do you guys know what I'm talking about?

38:44.560 --> 38:47.920
No, so this one would start off and it would be,

38:47.920 --> 38:50.000
you know, I think Travis's instincts are right.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.840
You put some Goldschlager in a lamp

38:51.840 --> 38:53.760
and you just drink that straight out of it.

38:53.760 --> 38:57.280
But then a bartender comes by to change the drink,

38:57.280 --> 39:01.520
add more to the drink to further recreate the events of the movie Kazam.

39:01.520 --> 39:02.400
And you know what he does?

39:02.400 --> 39:04.240
He fills that lamp up with gin.

39:07.760 --> 39:10.640
And then he pours it onto a boom box, ruining the boom box.

39:12.240 --> 39:13.680
Well, that's not really,

39:13.680 --> 39:15.040
I mean, well, what he would need to do is-

39:15.040 --> 39:16.160
If that does happen in the movie,

39:16.160 --> 39:17.920
he transfers from a lamp to a boom box.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.200
Griffin, I'm not making this up whole plot.

39:19.200 --> 39:20.560
No, no, no, no, no, I know that.

39:20.560 --> 39:22.320
I'm saying it wouldn't ruin the boom box.

39:22.320 --> 39:25.120
We'd somehow need a boom box that when alcohol is poured on it,

39:25.120 --> 39:26.720
really, really good music comes out.

39:27.920 --> 39:33.440
What if you had to throw ice into the drink from the free throw line

39:33.440 --> 39:34.560
and then you always missed?

39:35.840 --> 39:36.960
Justin's got a good point here.

39:36.960 --> 39:39.040
We're focusing a lot on Kazam based stuff

39:39.040 --> 39:42.320
and I don't even think that's what Mr. O'Neill is like mostly known for.

39:42.320 --> 39:46.080
I do want to know, Justin, that was a sports pool there.

39:46.080 --> 39:47.600
You're not known for those.

39:47.600 --> 39:50.720
Did you just Google like funny things to know about Shaq?

39:51.360 --> 39:53.120
No, I don't know a lot about-

39:53.120 --> 39:55.120
That's one that just has sort of stuck in the crawl.

39:55.120 --> 39:56.960
I think because when I love something,

39:56.960 --> 40:00.000
I need to know its weakness should I ever need to destroy it.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.400
And I love Shaq so much that I need to know

40:02.400 --> 40:06.400
should I ever encounter him, where he's vulnerable so I can-

40:06.400 --> 40:09.440
Hi, welcome to the My Brother, My Brother, Me Boss Strategy Guide here.

40:09.440 --> 40:12.640
We're talking about fighting Shaq.

40:12.640 --> 40:14.400
The one thing to know if you ever fight,

40:14.400 --> 40:17.600
like you're gonna need to get past the free throw line

40:17.600 --> 40:19.040
because he won't be able to get you there.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.680
Yeah, so if I ever need to bring down Shaq, that's how I do it.

40:23.680 --> 40:25.600
I just bring up that little thing

40:25.600 --> 40:26.960
and I bet no one's ever done it before.

40:28.000 --> 40:28.960
Well, hold on, Justin.

40:29.840 --> 40:31.920
Aaron Carter did beat Shaq.

40:31.920 --> 40:33.200
Yeah, that's a good point.

40:33.200 --> 40:35.200
That's another good weakness to bring up.

40:35.200 --> 40:38.720
Hey, Shaq, great commentating today.

40:38.720 --> 40:41.040
Remember when Aaron Carter beat you?

40:41.040 --> 40:44.000
At basketball, the whole song about how we did it.

40:45.280 --> 40:45.840
That's weird.

40:45.840 --> 40:47.680
Hey, Shaq, can you break down for me

40:47.680 --> 40:49.840
sort of what happened on the court out there?

40:49.840 --> 40:52.400
I mean, obviously I've heard Aaron's version,

40:52.400 --> 40:58.960
but I feel like it probably inflates Mr. Carter's talent on the court in song.

40:58.960 --> 41:02.160
I would love to hear from your giant perspective

41:02.160 --> 41:05.440
what happened out there and how you lost so bad to a small boy.

41:06.080 --> 41:07.360
Oh, well, thank you for asking.

41:07.360 --> 41:09.040
It's 100% accurate.

41:09.040 --> 41:10.560
That's exactly how it happens.

41:10.560 --> 41:12.560
I've never been more embarrassed in my life.

41:13.280 --> 41:15.680
I would just like to say to Aaron Carter,

41:15.680 --> 41:17.360
how could you, how could you do this?

41:17.360 --> 41:20.160
We promised that we would keep the incident between us

41:20.160 --> 41:22.960
and then you wrote a hit song about it

41:22.960 --> 41:24.320
and I'll never forgive you.

41:24.320 --> 41:26.640
A hit docu-song.

41:26.640 --> 41:30.800
Does Shaquille O'Neal have a song called

41:30.800 --> 41:34.320
How I Lost to Aaron Carter, the companion piece?

41:34.320 --> 41:37.920
How I Embarrassed Myself While Playing Against Aaron Carter.

41:37.920 --> 41:41.040
And it's like, all right, listen, I had the flu.

41:41.040 --> 41:42.800
I wasn't feeling good, how about you?

41:43.520 --> 41:45.520
My shoe was untied, I was really bummed.

41:46.240 --> 41:51.040
I'm 100 feet tall, I hit my head on the moon and I fell over.

41:51.040 --> 41:54.080
I feel like it's more of like an eight minute long dirge

41:54.080 --> 41:56.080
that he co-wrote with Leonard Cohen.

41:56.640 --> 42:00.720
It's like, if Tower of Song was about basketball,

42:00.720 --> 42:04.640
like that is the song that I think that is like, he.

42:05.440 --> 42:08.800
I knew it was time to get out of the basketball game.

42:09.840 --> 42:13.600
Little Aaron Carter really put me to b-ball shame.

42:13.600 --> 42:15.520
Like over and over again for eight minutes.

42:15.520 --> 42:18.240
Yeah, it had to be, I think it was probably

42:18.240 --> 42:21.440
a much closer game than Mr. Carter.

42:21.440 --> 42:23.440
You don't get a final tally, do you?

42:23.440 --> 42:24.480
You don't, no.

42:25.280 --> 42:26.560
I mean, Mr. Carter wants you to think

42:26.560 --> 42:29.040
that he obliterated Shaquille O'Neal.

42:29.040 --> 42:31.520
I just can't believe it, I just can't believe it's true.

42:31.520 --> 42:35.040
I think there was probably a series of circumstances

42:35.040 --> 42:39.040
that led to Shaquille O'Neal being at a handicap.

42:39.040 --> 42:41.440
Maybe in the room, the room had to be very low.

42:41.440 --> 42:43.520
I imagine it was probably not a regulation size

42:44.720 --> 42:46.640
basketball set up.

42:46.640 --> 42:48.480
And I think, I'll go ahead and say it,

42:48.480 --> 42:50.480
the ball was a bit deflated, wasn't it?

42:50.480 --> 42:52.320
So like Shaquille's usual dribbling techniques

42:52.320 --> 42:53.440
would leave him fumbling.

42:54.080 --> 42:56.720
And how do we even know it was the Shaquille O'Neal?

42:56.720 --> 42:58.560
This might've been a completely different Shaquille O'Neal.

42:58.560 --> 43:00.240
It could've been a different Shaquille O'Neal.

43:00.240 --> 43:01.200
Found at the supermarket.

43:01.200 --> 43:04.160
I'm saying, what proof does Aaron Carter have

43:04.880 --> 43:06.720
that it was the Shaquille O'Neal?

43:07.520 --> 43:08.000
Damn it.

43:08.640 --> 43:08.880
Yeah.

43:09.920 --> 43:11.360
And also he had flubber.

43:13.040 --> 43:14.160
He probably had flubber.

43:14.800 --> 43:16.240
A lot of people don't know that.

43:17.760 --> 43:21.200
Shaquille O'Neal released five albums.

43:21.840 --> 43:23.680
Shaquille O'Neal has five musical albums.

43:24.640 --> 43:26.480
Shaquille O'Neal has four musical albums.

43:26.480 --> 43:28.960
The fifth one went unreleased.

43:28.960 --> 43:29.460
No.

43:30.560 --> 43:32.400
Shaquille O'Neal wrote an album called

43:32.400 --> 43:35.120
Shaquille O'Neal Presents His Super Friends Vol. 1.

43:36.240 --> 43:38.160
It was completed in 2001,

43:38.160 --> 43:41.360
intended to be the NBA superstar's fifth solo album.

43:41.360 --> 43:45.600
Producers include Rick Rock and Dr. Dre.

43:45.600 --> 43:49.040
It was slated to come out September 11th, 2001,

43:49.040 --> 43:52.320
but then it got pushed back to October 9th of the same year.

43:52.320 --> 43:54.880
After much delay, the album was abandoned completely

43:54.880 --> 43:56.000
and never released.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.960
We have to break into the Disney vault and get it out.

43:58.960 --> 43:59.460
I need it.

44:00.160 --> 44:02.400
One thing that's messed up about the words

44:02.400 --> 44:03.360
in How I Beat-

44:03.360 --> 44:05.680
That's How I Beat Shaq by Aaron Carter.

44:05.680 --> 44:07.760
I want to just fast forward to the moment

44:08.640 --> 44:12.560
when the game really climaxed.

44:12.560 --> 44:13.760
Announcers were shocked.

44:13.760 --> 44:15.200
Couldn't believe it was real.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.080
I can't believe a kid just stuffed O'Neal.

44:18.960 --> 44:21.280
One more second was all that remained.

44:21.920 --> 44:22.960
I put the ball up.

44:22.960 --> 44:25.120
I put him in shame.

44:25.120 --> 44:27.440
I must admit that sounds real crazy,

44:27.920 --> 44:29.040
but the ball went in,

44:29.920 --> 44:31.600
then he cried like a baby.

44:31.600 --> 44:33.600
I don't think that's necessary.

44:33.600 --> 44:35.760
Now you're just dragging Mr. O'Neal,

44:35.760 --> 44:37.120
and it's unnecessary.

44:37.120 --> 44:40.320
Also, it's okay if a grown man cries

44:40.320 --> 44:42.320
when he's beat by a 10-year-old at basketball.

44:42.320 --> 44:44.720
Aaron cried like a baby.

44:44.720 --> 44:46.560
That's so diminutive and judgmental.

44:46.560 --> 44:47.440
There's just no-

44:47.440 --> 44:50.720
First of all, Aaron, there's no fucking world

44:50.720 --> 44:52.240
in which you pull this off again.

44:52.240 --> 44:55.600
The series of crazy events that happened,

44:55.600 --> 44:58.880
there was like a solar flare and a deflated ball

44:58.880 --> 45:01.040
and Shaq had mono.

45:01.040 --> 45:02.960
Like, there's no way you could do this again.

45:02.960 --> 45:04.080
Not in a million, million years.

45:04.080 --> 45:05.280
Not in a million years.

45:05.280 --> 45:07.600
I hope you enjoyed that one time you beat Shaq.

45:09.040 --> 45:10.960
Hey, real quick.

45:11.600 --> 45:14.800
Shaquille O'Neal presents his Super Friends Volume 1.

45:14.800 --> 45:16.400
Just like to talk about some of the collaborators

45:16.400 --> 45:17.360
on this tracklist.

45:17.360 --> 45:21.760
Dr. Dre, Nate Dogg, Boys 2 Men, Twista,

45:21.760 --> 45:24.400
George Clinton, Snoop Dogg, The Roots,

45:25.200 --> 45:26.880
Ludacris, Black Star.

45:28.640 --> 45:31.600
This album could be the best album ever made.

45:31.600 --> 45:32.400
How do I get-

45:32.400 --> 45:32.960
You have to find it.

45:32.960 --> 45:35.040
I have to find Shaquille O'Neal presents

45:35.040 --> 45:36.560
his Super Friends Volume 1.

45:37.200 --> 45:39.600
Do you think every day Shaquille O'Neal opens the vault

45:39.600 --> 45:40.960
behind the picture,

45:40.960 --> 45:42.480
like behind the painting in his house,

45:42.480 --> 45:45.040
and he looks at the album and he's like,

45:45.040 --> 45:46.320
no, not yet.

45:46.320 --> 45:47.280
It's not ready yet.

45:47.280 --> 45:48.160
No one's ready for that.

45:48.160 --> 45:50.720
Mr. O'Neal, drop that shit on us.

45:50.720 --> 45:52.480
We are so ready.

45:53.520 --> 45:54.960
What if you're not though, Griffin?

45:54.960 --> 45:56.400
What if you fucking think you're ready,

45:56.400 --> 45:58.160
but then you hear it and your face melts

45:58.160 --> 46:00.080
like the guy in, you know,

46:00.880 --> 46:02.640
the arc, Raiders of the Lost Ark.

46:04.640 --> 46:05.200
I'm just saying.

46:06.240 --> 46:08.320
There's a world in which How I Beat Shaq

46:08.320 --> 46:10.640
is a really dark remake of the toy

46:10.640 --> 46:11.920
starring Richard Pryor.

46:12.480 --> 46:17.200
What if Aaron Carter's father paid Shaq

46:17.200 --> 46:19.360
an exorbitant amount of money

46:19.360 --> 46:21.440
to force him to lose at basketball

46:21.440 --> 46:22.320
to Aaron Carter?

46:24.320 --> 46:26.880
What if that is how it shook out, right?

46:26.880 --> 46:28.800
So the optics on it are not great

46:28.800 --> 46:31.520
for any of the parties involved, I'll consent,

46:31.520 --> 46:33.920
but what if that's how this played out?

46:33.920 --> 46:37.760
Like it was basically like a huge birthday present

46:37.760 --> 46:38.880
for Aaron Carter,

46:38.880 --> 46:41.200
and it was kind of a conspiracy theory.

46:41.200 --> 46:42.640
Like there's been a lot of coverup,

46:42.640 --> 46:44.160
but maybe that's how it shook out.

46:44.960 --> 46:45.840
Holy shit.

46:45.840 --> 46:47.680
That's, I mean, that is what happened.

46:47.680 --> 46:49.120
I don't think that's an alternate world.

46:49.120 --> 46:50.720
I think that is the subtext to that song.

46:50.720 --> 46:52.160
Has to be, has to be.

46:52.160 --> 46:53.760
Also, just one more thing I want to say

46:53.760 --> 46:55.040
before we move on from this topic.

46:55.040 --> 46:57.040
Oh no, I also have more things to say about this topic.

46:57.040 --> 46:58.480
We are not even close to moving on.

46:59.040 --> 47:00.160
Where's my rematch?

47:00.720 --> 47:03.760
Okay, I want this rematch.

47:03.760 --> 47:06.720
Aaron Carter should be in the prime of his life.

47:06.720 --> 47:09.120
He's gotta be what, 45 now, something?

47:09.120 --> 47:09.600
I don't know.

47:10.320 --> 47:12.800
Seems like this would be the time

47:12.800 --> 47:14.560
for him to compete against Shaq.

47:14.560 --> 47:16.320
Oh God, he's only 28 years old.

47:16.320 --> 47:17.760
What in the living fuck?

47:17.760 --> 47:20.640
Okay, so Aaron Carter, 28 years old,

47:20.640 --> 47:21.680
should be in his prime.

47:23.360 --> 47:25.200
Let's see, he's gonna be in DC

47:25.200 --> 47:27.120
at the Howard Theater, October 20th.

47:27.120 --> 47:27.920
Let's get it on.

47:28.480 --> 47:29.520
Shaq, get by there.

47:29.520 --> 47:31.280
Let's get this rematch going.

47:31.280 --> 47:35.040
Yes, I'll Google a nearby basketball zone

47:35.040 --> 47:37.040
and we will get this fucking thing going.

47:37.040 --> 47:38.560
Also, just want to bring up the track

47:38.560 --> 47:41.440
on Shaq Presents the Super Friends Volume One

47:42.160 --> 47:43.600
with Dr. Dre is called

47:43.600 --> 47:48.560
I Will Have My Revenge on the Blonde Child.

47:48.560 --> 47:49.840
And that's the opener.

47:49.840 --> 47:51.040
That's the first song is

47:51.040 --> 47:53.440
I Will Have My Revenge on the Blonde Child.

47:53.440 --> 47:56.560
So it looks like he's got one here with Will.i.am

47:56.560 --> 47:57.200
and it's called

47:57.200 --> 47:58.960
I Will Drink the Blonde Child's Blood

47:58.960 --> 48:00.640
Like Basketball Milk.

48:00.640 --> 48:02.560
That seems like a wild track.

48:03.280 --> 48:05.600
Little known fact, the reason that it was never released,

48:05.600 --> 48:08.640
Aaron Carter actually paid to buy the album

48:08.640 --> 48:11.360
so that it would never be heard by human ears.

48:11.360 --> 48:15.840
And that, my friends, is how he, in fact, did beat Shaq.

48:15.840 --> 48:17.440
He's been keeping it quiet.

48:17.440 --> 48:20.400
There's a song here with George Clinton and Snoop Dogg

48:20.400 --> 48:21.040
that's called

48:21.040 --> 48:22.480
On the Day of the Fateful Game

48:22.480 --> 48:24.320
I Had a Big and Powerful Sickness.

48:27.920 --> 48:29.360
I'm actually looking at this track list

48:29.360 --> 48:32.080
and every song on this album is sort of an explanation

48:32.080 --> 48:34.480
for why he lost the basketball game to Aaron Carter.

48:35.040 --> 48:36.240
By the way, I was just kidding.

48:36.240 --> 48:38.480
The song that he does with George Clinton and Snoop Dogg

48:38.480 --> 48:39.840
is Atomic Dog.

48:39.840 --> 48:41.840
Mr. O'Neil, one question.

48:42.480 --> 48:44.000
I don't think you can just do that.

48:45.280 --> 48:46.960
I like that Atomic Dogg song.

48:46.960 --> 48:48.240
I would like it on my album.

48:48.240 --> 48:50.080
Well, we already did it.

48:50.640 --> 48:51.120
Did it.

48:51.680 --> 48:53.760
I know, but I'm putting an album together

48:53.760 --> 48:55.920
and I would really, really like that song on it.

48:56.480 --> 48:58.480
Yeah, on my album this time.

48:58.480 --> 49:01.040
But me do, but I'll do it.

49:01.040 --> 49:02.080
But I'll do it.

49:02.080 --> 49:03.920
I'll be Snoop Dogg this time.

49:03.920 --> 49:05.440
Thank you so much for listening to our

49:07.840 --> 49:09.280
Shaq and Aaron Carter beef cast.

49:09.280 --> 49:10.640
My brother, my brother, and me.

49:10.640 --> 49:12.400
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

49:12.400 --> 49:14.560
Unless you're Shaq, in which case I can imagine.

49:15.120 --> 49:17.120
This was a troubling episode.

49:17.120 --> 49:17.920
Or Aaron Carter.

49:17.920 --> 49:20.480
I feel like both of them didn't get out of it, okay?

49:20.480 --> 49:21.600
Yeah, sorry, it's kind of a short one.

49:21.600 --> 49:23.680
Travis has to leave to start a new life

49:23.680 --> 49:25.840
in the Queen City, Cincinnati.

49:27.120 --> 49:31.120
Safe travels, Travis, and good luck on your journey.

49:31.120 --> 49:31.840
Thank you, brother.

49:32.480 --> 49:33.040
Bon chance.

49:33.840 --> 49:36.560
I hope you've brought much smoked meat

49:36.560 --> 49:38.000
to sustain you on your voyage.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.560
I have, I must go out and interview guides

49:40.560 --> 49:45.680
to lead me from this western Virginia county.

49:45.680 --> 49:47.120
Oh, you just take the double A up.

49:47.120 --> 49:47.920
It's not that hard.

49:47.920 --> 49:48.400
Oh, really?

49:48.400 --> 49:49.920
Yeah, it's gonna be easy.

49:49.920 --> 49:53.920
Okay, I was gonna take 52 and then disconnect with the 104-73.

49:53.920 --> 49:55.440
The double A takes like 15 minutes longer,

49:55.440 --> 49:57.520
but it's way prettier, like way more scenic.

49:57.520 --> 49:58.240
Oh, yeah?

49:58.240 --> 50:00.800
Yeah, but there's like no fast food, there's nothing.

50:00.800 --> 50:03.680
Yeah, gas up before, because like there's like nothing on it.

50:03.680 --> 50:07.760
Anyway, anyway, thank you, Travis,

50:07.760 --> 50:10.240
a sincere thank you to you all.

50:10.240 --> 50:13.280
First off, everybody who came out to Candle Nights,

50:13.280 --> 50:14.720
thank you, a huge thank you to you,

50:14.720 --> 50:16.880

50:16.880 --> 50:20.560
like just for us raising a bunch of money

50:20.560 --> 50:22.800
for Recovery Point and Addiction Recovery Center

50:22.800 --> 50:24.080
here in Huntington.

50:24.080 --> 50:26.720
So thank you so much for doing that

50:26.720 --> 50:28.960

50:28.960 --> 50:31.600
and making the trip to Huntington and everything.

50:32.400 --> 50:34.240
Everybody seemed to have a good time, so thank you.

50:34.240 --> 50:37.280
So, yeah, we are done with the TV show.

50:37.280 --> 50:39.680
I think this episode's also going up on Tuesday

50:40.480 --> 50:42.160
because we're recording it very, very late,

50:42.720 --> 50:45.280
but I promise we're gonna get back on a regular schedule

50:46.400 --> 50:48.640
and things are looking up.

50:48.640 --> 50:50.320
I feel like we open up this podcast

50:50.320 --> 50:52.320
by complaining about doing the TV show.

50:52.320 --> 50:54.000
Really, we're just complaining about doing work.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.480
I think the TV show, I mean, I don't think,

50:56.480 --> 50:58.560
I know the TV show's gonna be great,

50:58.560 --> 51:00.560
and I really think you all are gonna love it,

51:01.760 --> 51:03.440
and I'm really excited for you to watch it.

51:03.440 --> 51:05.200

51:05.200 --> 51:08.080

51:08.080 --> 51:10.080
but I wanna thank everybody who helped out with it,

51:10.640 --> 51:12.880
not helped out, the people who actually made the TV show.

51:13.520 --> 51:15.440
Yeah, who let us be in the show.

51:15.440 --> 51:17.360
Who let us be in your television show you made.

51:17.360 --> 51:19.360

51:22.320 --> 51:23.440
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

It's a really great album.

51:24.320 --> 51:26.240
You should go get it if you don't have it already.

And it's not gotten any easier to describe.

52:54.560 --> 52:57.040
So we asked our fans to do it for us.

52:57.040 --> 53:01.440
Jordan Jesse Go is a weekly conversation with two best pals.

53:01.440 --> 53:02.720
Two hilarious friends.

53:02.720 --> 53:04.400
The hilarious smart kids.

53:04.400 --> 53:06.560
Talking about hilarious stuff that happens to them.

53:06.560 --> 53:08.320
Mostly really stupid stuff.

53:08.320 --> 53:12.400
Awkward and it goes insane tangents, heartfelt stuff.

53:12.400 --> 53:15.280
It's like being thrown in the middle of a hilarious conversation

53:15.280 --> 53:17.040
between you and your best pal.

53:17.040 --> 53:18.720
It's a show that makes me laugh every week,

53:18.720 --> 53:20.640
which is pretty rare and wonderful.

53:20.640 --> 53:22.640
