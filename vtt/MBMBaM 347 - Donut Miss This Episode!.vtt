00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
Hi folks, this is Griffin McElroy, your baby brother.

00:02.640 --> 00:04.960
And this is Travis McElroy, your middlest brother.

00:04.960 --> 00:08.840
And what you're about to hear is the first episode

00:08.840 --> 00:10.180
of the Max Fun Drive 2017,

00:10.180 --> 00:12.800
Welcome to the Slam and Come On and Jam and all that.

00:12.800 --> 00:14.240
Justin's not here by the way.

00:15.400 --> 00:16.920
Cause he got slammed and jammed.

00:16.920 --> 00:17.760
Yeah.

00:17.760 --> 00:19.120
He literally got turned into a basketball

00:19.120 --> 00:20.200
and he got dunked through a hoop

00:20.200 --> 00:22.880
and he fell into a cartoon alternate universe

00:22.880 --> 00:23.840
and he got put through a hoop

00:23.840 --> 00:26.080
and like he needs surgery and stuff now.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.560
It's very sad, but you know what?

00:28.560 --> 00:31.600
It's the risk you take when you play with the Monstars.

00:31.600 --> 00:32.440
You know what I mean?

00:32.440 --> 00:33.280
Yeah.

00:33.280 --> 00:36.560
In the game of jams, you win or you die.

00:36.560 --> 00:37.400
Exactly.

00:37.400 --> 00:38.280
Well, Justin lost and lived.

00:38.280 --> 00:40.960
But anyway, that's all beside the point.

00:40.960 --> 00:42.200
What you need to know about this episode,

00:42.200 --> 00:44.680
one, we recorded it in Portland hours

00:44.680 --> 00:46.360
before our Portland live show,

00:46.360 --> 00:48.960
which by the way, hey Portland, what's up?

00:48.960 --> 00:50.320
Thanks for coming out on Saturday.

00:50.320 --> 00:53.160
We had a good time and a good night with you.

00:53.160 --> 00:54.960
That live episode, we are probably gonna save

00:54.960 --> 00:56.240
until after the Max Fun Drive,

00:56.240 --> 01:00.240
but it was super fucking fun and very weird and really long.

01:00.240 --> 01:02.000
It was like our longest live show ever.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.120
So it was a blast.

01:03.120 --> 01:04.720
The other thing you should probably know

01:04.720 --> 01:09.080
about this episode, what's a good way to put this?

01:09.080 --> 01:13.200
Okay, so we recorded it in a hotel room altogether

01:13.200 --> 01:18.200
using a new setup and there's some minor audio issues.

01:20.480 --> 01:22.280
Travis sounds like he's maybe recording

01:22.280 --> 01:23.760
from a well or something.

01:23.760 --> 01:25.960
You can listen, don't let Griffin oversell it.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.760
You can totally understand everything I say

01:27.760 --> 01:28.880
and you can hear me.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.760
It just sounds like Griffin and Justin

01:30.760 --> 01:33.320
made me record in the hallway

01:33.320 --> 01:35.760
while they were in the hotel room.

01:35.760 --> 01:37.720
Travis got put in the boo-boo box.

01:37.720 --> 01:39.640
Anyway, that's not great.

01:39.640 --> 01:42.040
And also there's a little bit of static interference

01:42.040 --> 01:43.040
that pops up every now and then.

01:43.040 --> 01:45.960
It's not like super loud or anything like that,

01:45.960 --> 01:47.560
but it's kind of annoying.

01:47.560 --> 01:49.960
We're recording this because it's Max Fun Drive

01:49.960 --> 01:51.840
and the last thing we want you to think

01:51.840 --> 01:54.280
is that we just kind of shit some stuff out.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.840
We recorded like a dozen podcasts last week

01:56.840 --> 01:58.800
and we actually have a lot more to record this week too

01:58.800 --> 02:01.720
and so this was sort of like the only way

02:01.720 --> 02:03.480
we could do this one and we just didn't realize

02:03.480 --> 02:06.120
that it wasn't up to our normal standards

02:06.120 --> 02:07.720
and that is regrettable considering

02:07.720 --> 02:09.400
it's the first week of the Max Fun Drive

02:09.400 --> 02:13.080
and we hope it doesn't reflect poorly on us

02:13.080 --> 02:14.360
or like what we think of the drive

02:14.360 --> 02:17.960
or you, the listeners, for supporting us

02:17.960 --> 02:21.360
because this episode aside, we really do spend your money

02:21.360 --> 02:25.520
to improve the show technically.

02:25.520 --> 02:29.600
So yes, we are sorry for the somewhat poor quality

02:29.600 --> 02:30.800
of the audio of this episode.

02:30.800 --> 02:34.000
But that said, I will say there were some moments of this

02:34.000 --> 02:35.880
where I was laughing my head off

02:35.880 --> 02:38.040
because like we're so very rarely,

02:38.040 --> 02:39.520
just as a little teaser,

02:39.520 --> 02:43.040
we do finally nail down our pitch for Austin Powers 4.

02:43.040 --> 02:46.440
Yes, there's very exciting, very important stuff

02:46.440 --> 02:47.440
to the canon of the podcast.

02:47.440 --> 02:50.720
So first off, thank you all for listening.

02:50.720 --> 02:54.600
Thank you all for being members of the Max Fun Network.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.960
We're gonna talk a lot about that in the actual episode

02:56.960 --> 02:59.000
but it really does mean a lot

02:59.000 --> 03:02.400
that you all would support us and help us to grow

03:02.400 --> 03:04.080
and like do stuff like travel to Portland

03:04.080 --> 03:07.440
and do a fun live show there and do all this stuff.

03:07.440 --> 03:08.920
We really appreciate you very, very much.

03:08.920 --> 03:12.360
The other thing, as sort of a mea culpa,

03:12.360 --> 03:15.120
sort of an apology for the less than awesome

03:15.120 --> 03:16.400
audio quality of this episode,

03:16.400 --> 03:18.720
we're gonna be putting out another thing

03:18.720 --> 03:20.600
this probably later this week, don't you think?

03:20.600 --> 03:21.440
Yeah, definitely.

03:21.440 --> 03:24.080
Maybe Thursday or Friday, somewhere in there.

03:24.080 --> 03:27.120
That we also recorded while we were in Portland

03:27.120 --> 03:29.000
and we can't give away,

03:29.000 --> 03:29.960
I don't wanna give away too much

03:29.960 --> 03:31.200
about this thing that we recorded.

03:31.200 --> 03:34.720
It could turn out to be the pilot of the next serial

03:34.720 --> 03:36.600
is what I'll say that. This is true, yeah.

03:36.600 --> 03:38.200
I'll also say we recorded this episode

03:38.200 --> 03:40.000
that you're about to hear before the live show.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.880
We recorded this other thing after the live show

03:42.880 --> 03:45.140
and let's just say there was a unique,

03:46.060 --> 03:49.840
wink, wink, wink, energy in the space.

03:49.840 --> 03:50.680
Wink, wink, wink.

03:50.680 --> 03:54.160
So that will be up later this week.

03:54.160 --> 03:55.560
But in the meantime,

03:55.560 --> 03:58.440
like brace yourselves for a little bit of audio issues,

03:58.440 --> 04:01.280
but like an episode that I'm actually really proud of

04:01.280 --> 04:02.480
and I would have been really sad

04:02.480 --> 04:04.160
if we had had to dump it. I know.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.960
So I'm very glad that you can,

04:05.960 --> 04:08.240
listen, still totally listenable.

04:08.240 --> 04:09.640
So don't let this turn you off.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.440
Portland is just an audio wormhole

04:11.440 --> 04:12.840
because the live show, the only live show

04:12.840 --> 04:14.920
we've never published got up in Portland too.

04:14.920 --> 04:17.520
There's just, I love Portland, man,

04:17.520 --> 04:19.120
love getting to the port city.

04:19.120 --> 04:22.280
There's audio demons and gremlins all over.

04:22.280 --> 04:24.440
Sasquatches, audio sasquatches.

04:24.440 --> 04:27.360
White noise just all over, just trying to creep on you.

04:27.360 --> 04:32.360
Anyway, that's it for this apology press conference.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.520
Any questions?

04:33.520 --> 04:35.520
Maximumfun.org forward slash donate

04:35.520 --> 04:37.600
if you wanna just get it out of the way now.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.280
Okay, yes, and then you're legally allowed

04:39.280 --> 04:42.920
to skip all the Max Fun Drive spots in this episode.

04:42.920 --> 04:45.220
Okay, let's get right to it.

04:45.220 --> 04:47.880
The McElroy brothers are not experts

04:47.880 --> 04:50.760
and their advice should never be followed.

04:50.760 --> 04:53.120
Travis insists he's a sexpert,

04:53.120 --> 04:56.520
but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

04:56.520 --> 04:58.860
Also, this show isn't for kids,

04:58.860 --> 05:01.240
which I mentioned only so the babies out there

05:01.240 --> 05:03.560
will know how cool they are for listening.

05:03.560 --> 05:04.760
What's up, you cool baby?

05:04.760 --> 05:18.760
It's familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar, it's a new craze.

05:18.760 --> 05:26.760
And good girls, do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna, just say, hey, I wanna.

05:26.760 --> 05:33.160
Hello, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me and the Advice Show for the modern era.

05:33.160 --> 05:36.280
I'm your oldest brother, Justin, Tyler McElroy.

05:36.280 --> 05:39.200
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis, Tyler McElroy.

05:39.200 --> 05:42.600
I'm your sweet baby brother, Tyler, Tyler, Tyler.

05:42.600 --> 05:48.760
You'll pay for the whole Tyler, but you'll only use the edge.

05:48.760 --> 05:50.200
Did you send out questions, Travis?

05:50.200 --> 05:51.720
I did, why?

05:51.720 --> 05:55.600
This is first, foremost, welcome to Max Fun Drive.

05:55.600 --> 05:58.080
Hell yeah, you did it, and we decided to do something

05:58.080 --> 05:59.880
real fucking special for you this time,

05:59.880 --> 06:02.840
which is to say we just ate a bunch of Voodoo donuts

06:02.840 --> 06:05.360
and I'm just fucking feeling it so hard, dude.

06:05.360 --> 06:09.080
Yeah, this is the donut, what's a good, catchy, zingy?

06:09.080 --> 06:11.200
Donut, skip this episode.

06:11.200 --> 06:12.400
No, that's not a good.

06:12.400 --> 06:13.400
It's really good.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.400
Donuts for donuts.

06:14.400 --> 06:17.200
No, the donutagon, the donutahedron.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.200
Donutahedron.

06:18.200 --> 06:22.520
Like, we had spaghetti again, and I feel like this is the follow-up,

06:22.520 --> 06:23.520
because we're jacked on.

06:23.520 --> 06:24.520
We're fucking jacked on donuts.

06:24.520 --> 06:25.520
Jacked on donuts.

06:25.520 --> 06:26.520
Sugar.

06:26.520 --> 06:29.280
We're in Portland, we're doing our Portland live show,

06:29.280 --> 06:30.640
and you know, we're all in the same room,

06:30.640 --> 06:33.080
so we thought, let's just make a very special episode.

06:33.080 --> 06:35.120
This is a chill, can you take a picture of this chill-ass sesh?

06:35.120 --> 06:37.160
I mean, not during the podcast, but probably during.

06:37.160 --> 06:40.400
Yeah, maybe not during, but Travis has this hooked up to the lav mics,

06:40.400 --> 06:43.760
which is weird, because I need that fucking totem of comedy in front of me.

06:43.760 --> 06:46.160
Yeah, it just feels like we're talking to each other, but I hate it.

06:46.160 --> 06:48.920
I need that big metal comedy dong in front of me

06:48.920 --> 06:50.800
that I can just sort of shout into.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.160
So it's weird, like I'm just looking at you and talking and like,

06:53.160 --> 06:54.160
is this being recorded?

06:54.160 --> 06:56.280
And I look down at this dumb old doohickey on my chest,

06:56.280 --> 06:58.480
and I'm like, oh yeah, this is good.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.720
So wait, so you say you sent questions.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.720
I did, episode 347.

07:02.720 --> 07:05.880
I literally titled it 347, Max Fun Drive week one,

07:05.880 --> 07:07.200
recorded live in Portland.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.680
Oh, you sent it like a grip ago.

07:08.680 --> 07:10.600
Dude, you sent it on March 16th.

07:10.600 --> 07:11.600
That was two days ago.

07:11.600 --> 07:12.760
Yeah, that was before St. Patrick's Day.

07:12.760 --> 07:14.640
I was prepared.

07:14.640 --> 07:16.480
So let's first start off with this.

07:16.480 --> 07:17.560
Let's first start off with this.

07:17.560 --> 07:19.920
Let's start off with this.

07:19.920 --> 07:21.400
Justin's pointing at me, so it's a vote.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.400
I want to start off with this.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.600
Well, hold on, mine was...

07:23.600 --> 07:25.320
No, I both, I want to start off.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.880
Oh, okay.

07:26.880 --> 07:27.880
I don't have anything.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.360
Okay, I got on an elevator last night

07:30.360 --> 07:33.320
when I got here to Portland at 12.45 a.m.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.480
with a St. Patrick's Day celebrant

07:37.880 --> 07:41.600
who smelled so much like two people's yards

07:41.600 --> 07:44.360
that it made me not want to be in the elevator with him.

07:45.240 --> 07:47.440
And so Portland just goes hard.

07:47.440 --> 07:48.280
I didn't know.

07:48.280 --> 07:49.600
Yeah, I didn't know y'all went hard.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.640
You don't see that on the Portlandia comedy show.

07:51.640 --> 07:54.840
You don't see people going fucking deep in the paint

07:54.840 --> 07:57.160
to celebrate St. Patrick's great sacrifice.

07:57.160 --> 07:59.880
I'll balance that out by saying I went to Rose and Thistle,

07:59.880 --> 08:01.800
local favorite, Rose and Thistle,

08:01.800 --> 08:04.200
had a nice, pleasant corned beef and cabbage,

08:04.200 --> 08:06.320
and again, it was very chill, and I left.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.280
Now, granted, this was five o'clock,

08:08.280 --> 08:11.000
so I don't think we'd hit peak celebration time.

08:11.000 --> 08:11.840
Yeah.

08:11.840 --> 08:12.680
But speaking of celebration-

08:12.680 --> 08:13.800
Hey, let's celebrate.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.440
What I wanted to start off with is

08:15.440 --> 08:16.680
it's week one of Max Fun Drive,

08:16.680 --> 08:18.640
and we're gonna tell you all about it as we go through.

08:18.640 --> 08:22.520
But right now, maximumfun.org forward slash donate.

08:22.520 --> 08:23.360
You know what?

08:23.360 --> 08:25.040
Listen, there's gonna be two weeks

08:25.040 --> 08:27.080
of people giving you really good reasons

08:27.080 --> 08:28.200
why you should donate.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.680
Why not just do it now?

08:29.680 --> 08:30.800
And it's like, I'm done.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.360
Yeah, I agree.

08:32.360 --> 08:33.200
And get that all out of the way.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.040
And you know what?

08:34.040 --> 08:34.880
Skip those parts.

08:34.880 --> 08:36.240
Yeah, then you're legally allowed to fast forward

08:36.240 --> 08:37.080
through the parts of this show

08:37.080 --> 08:38.040
that you don't wanna listen to.

08:38.040 --> 08:39.840
So if you have been waiting for the perfect time

08:39.840 --> 08:41.600
to become a Max Fun donor, it's now.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.080
It's the my brother, my brother, me fast pass.

08:44.080 --> 08:46.000
Go ahead and fast and donate now.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.400
But listen, if you try to fast forward

08:47.400 --> 08:48.600
and you didn't donate, we'll know

08:48.600 --> 08:49.680
and we'll shock your finger.

08:49.680 --> 08:51.000
Yeah.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.600
I have been waiting to reveal this to you

08:53.600 --> 08:55.760
until we were all recording.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.800
Last night, I arrived in the evening

08:58.800 --> 09:01.720
a few hours after my brother Travis did.

09:01.720 --> 09:03.520
And I called him to say what,

09:03.520 --> 09:04.360
you know what I'm about to say.

09:04.360 --> 09:05.200
Yes, it is.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.520
I called him and I said, where are you at?

09:06.520 --> 09:07.440
He said, I'm in the hotel.

09:07.440 --> 09:08.280
I'm right above you.

09:08.280 --> 09:11.040
So I would go up to his room.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.640
He said, I just, and then when I called,

09:13.640 --> 09:15.040
he said, I just got dessert, come on up.

09:15.040 --> 09:15.880
I was like, okay, cool.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.680
I go up, my little brother Travis

09:17.680 --> 09:22.680
has ordered three discrete desserts for himself.

09:24.280 --> 09:25.120
Oh, that's no.

09:25.120 --> 09:27.760
That's no knowledge of my presence.

09:27.760 --> 09:30.240
Travis has ordered three discrete desserts.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.920
When I asked him, when I inquired,

09:31.920 --> 09:34.880
what would possess him to get three discrete desserts?

09:34.880 --> 09:37.560
He told me I was bored.

09:37.560 --> 09:40.640
So that is not, I don't think that that.

09:40.640 --> 09:42.560
I wanted to, yeah, okay, listen.

09:42.560 --> 09:43.600
What were the three desserts?

09:43.600 --> 09:44.440
First off, let me hit the show.

09:44.440 --> 09:45.280
Thank you.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.360
First it was, I believe it was a peanut chocolate bomb

09:47.360 --> 09:49.640
with salted caramel.

09:49.640 --> 09:53.040
And then there was a like vanilla ice cream

09:53.040 --> 09:54.880
and chocolate brownie number.

09:54.880 --> 09:57.440
And a set of three creme brulees,

09:57.440 --> 10:00.080
or as I like to call them, creme delays.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.080
Why?

10:02.080 --> 10:03.760
Because I used to make a delay hill.

10:03.760 --> 10:05.040
Okay, yeah, sure.

10:05.040 --> 10:05.880
Love that guy.

10:05.880 --> 10:07.400
And so I had three creme delays.

10:07.400 --> 10:08.240
And.

10:08.240 --> 10:13.240
You know he's fucked up and said it that way once.

10:13.720 --> 10:17.120
And Mr. Hill, will you have the creme delay?

10:17.120 --> 10:18.640
I mean, shit.

10:18.640 --> 10:19.480
Shit.

10:19.480 --> 10:22.680
And I had not intended to eat all three of them.

10:22.680 --> 10:26.280
I just wanted to sample what life in Portland hotels was like.

10:26.280 --> 10:27.120
Yeah.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.560
This is a good hotel though.

10:28.560 --> 10:31.320
I'm enjoying this hotel, the Hotel Eastland

10:31.320 --> 10:32.160
is where we're staying.

10:32.160 --> 10:33.000
Well, yeah, people won't hear this.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.040
They'll have to run out of it.

10:34.040 --> 10:36.880
Right, Hotel Eastland, room 205 at 305.

10:36.880 --> 10:38.680
Better luck next time, murderers.

10:39.920 --> 10:41.520
You'll never murder us this time.

10:41.520 --> 10:43.120
You'll catch us on the next go round.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.920
This is gonna be really sad if we do get murdered.

10:44.920 --> 10:48.280
Portland, this is released posthumously.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.040
Should we get going?

10:51.040 --> 10:51.880
Yeah, let's go.

10:51.880 --> 10:52.880
I'm gonna tell you about the Max Fun Drive

10:52.880 --> 10:53.720
and the cool stuff you can earn.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.120
Just go donate, you'll get cool stuff.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.080
We really need it and appreciate it.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.120
MaxFunFun.org forward slash donate.

10:59.120 --> 10:59.960
Donate.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.520
I'm a busboy at a popular chain restaurant

11:01.520 --> 11:02.880
and I need some advice.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.520
I frequently work long shifts

11:04.520 --> 11:05.800
that begin early in the morning

11:05.800 --> 11:08.160
and end in the late afternoon with no break.

11:08.160 --> 11:09.920
And I have a tendency to skimp on breakfast.

11:09.920 --> 11:10.760
So bad.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.280
Tim Ferriss says you need 30 grams of protein

11:12.280 --> 11:13.760
within 30 minutes of waking up.

11:13.760 --> 11:14.600
Who says this?

11:14.600 --> 11:17.400
Tim Ferriss for our work week for our body.

11:17.400 --> 11:18.240
Oh, I don't know who that is.

11:18.240 --> 11:19.360
It's a slow carb diet.

11:19.360 --> 11:20.400
Slow carb?

11:20.400 --> 11:21.240
Slow carb?

11:21.240 --> 11:23.560
Yeah, it's like low carb.

11:23.560 --> 11:27.000
It's like low carb minus cheese and dairy plus beans.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.640
So beans at every meal.

11:28.640 --> 11:29.480
So you go to the Cheesecake Factory

11:29.480 --> 11:30.960
and you just really take your time.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.040
No, you don't.

11:32.040 --> 11:32.880
No, what?

11:32.880 --> 11:33.720
You're not listening to me.

11:33.720 --> 11:35.480
Travis, should we turn the air conditioner off, you think?

11:35.480 --> 11:36.320
I'm worried it's gonna get big.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.000
No, listen, I want people to know

11:38.000 --> 11:39.600
what it feels like to be in a hotel room.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.320
Okay, well, we're nice and cool.

11:41.320 --> 11:42.160
No, I've been doing it.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.240
That's why I was so hyped about donuts.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.240
Actually, why, I'm kinda surprised

11:46.240 --> 11:47.840
you didn't drop this bomb.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.840
We'll get back to this question in a second.

11:49.840 --> 11:52.160
I've been doing the slow carb diet,

11:52.160 --> 11:55.880
so I've only been eating no sugar, nothing white,

11:55.880 --> 12:00.880
no milk, no dairy, no sugar, no fruit, no...

12:00.880 --> 12:01.840
Well, this is a bad diet.

12:01.840 --> 12:04.200
If it's like, don't fruit it up, dude.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.160
Now, do you think your ancestors

12:06.160 --> 12:08.040
had easy accessibility to fruit?

12:08.040 --> 12:10.600
Yeah, they just looked up in a tree

12:10.600 --> 12:11.600
and they're like, let's eat those.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.200
There's some red stuff up here, that's weird.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.920
Fruit toast is sugar, it's sugar, guys.

12:14.920 --> 12:15.960
Hey, guys, it's sugar.

12:15.960 --> 12:18.840
So wait, you're telling me that you have the inside scoop

12:18.840 --> 12:19.960
that fruit is bad for you?

12:19.960 --> 12:21.400
Fruit's bad, you heard it here first.

12:21.400 --> 12:22.680
Fruit is sugar.

12:22.680 --> 12:25.160
You're dropping on me, you're dropping on me.

12:25.160 --> 12:27.120
Hold up, we'll get back to the question in a second.

12:27.120 --> 12:29.080
Fruit is bad for you.

12:29.080 --> 12:30.480
Signed, Justin Mackerel.

12:30.480 --> 12:33.160
No, if I was a person of a healthy weight,

12:33.160 --> 12:35.440
fruit in moderation would be good for me.

12:35.440 --> 12:36.280
I'm not.

12:36.280 --> 12:37.120
But once you get overweight,

12:37.120 --> 12:37.960
you're not allowed to have fruit anymore?

12:37.960 --> 12:39.160
Because now fruit is bad for you?

12:39.160 --> 12:41.080
No, because it's just sugar, guys.

12:41.080 --> 12:43.680
It's high, okay, Travis, where does sugar come from?

12:44.960 --> 12:46.080
No, tell me, this is not a joke.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.480
Bees. Bees, okay, bad.

12:48.480 --> 12:49.320
Space.

12:49.320 --> 12:50.160
Where does sugar come from, Travis?

12:50.160 --> 12:52.120
Not space, you know where does sugar come from?

12:52.120 --> 12:53.920
It comes from cane, Justin.

12:53.920 --> 12:57.920
Which is a plant that grows from being ground.

12:57.920 --> 13:02.240
So why is it that if you eat a bunch of that plant,

13:02.240 --> 13:04.520
that's a bad thing you should avoid for diet,

13:04.520 --> 13:08.560
but if you eat one that looks like runts, then it's fine.

13:08.560 --> 13:10.880
Well, runts is a great, you've complicated this

13:10.880 --> 13:12.240
by bringing runts into the equation

13:12.240 --> 13:14.360
because I look at these little guys and I'm like,

13:14.360 --> 13:15.600
is it fruit or no?

13:15.600 --> 13:19.480
Because it sure as hell looks like it.

13:19.480 --> 13:21.280
They should make candy shaped like vegetables.

13:21.280 --> 13:23.560
I have to eat 30 grams of protein

13:23.560 --> 13:25.040
within 30 minutes of waking.

13:25.040 --> 13:25.880
Or you will die.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.040
With beans.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.280
It's like that Jason Statham movie.

13:29.280 --> 13:32.040
Every morning I wake up and eat four scrambled eggs

13:32.040 --> 13:34.480
and a bunch of lentils and black beans

13:34.480 --> 13:37.840
and vegetables sometimes within 30 minutes of waking.

13:37.840 --> 13:39.520
Sydney says, and I quote,

13:39.520 --> 13:41.920
that is not a smell I ever want to wake up to again.

13:41.920 --> 13:44.200
I have no choice, that's why I have to eat it.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.280
And I don't want to be blue here,

13:45.280 --> 13:48.160
so let's be delicate.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.960
But how's your 9 a.m. constitutional?

13:50.960 --> 13:52.520
How's your beamers?

13:52.520 --> 13:54.440
Not applicable.

13:54.440 --> 13:56.720
But anyway, on the seventh day.

13:56.720 --> 13:58.680
You just put the questions down.

13:58.680 --> 14:01.680
There's no, Justin just made the decision of,

14:01.680 --> 14:03.200
well, I'm not going back to this.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.120
No, I'm going back to it.

14:04.120 --> 14:06.200
I just want to say that one of the things

14:06.200 --> 14:08.200
is on the seventh day on Saturday.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.040
Justin rests.

14:10.840 --> 14:12.440
That day is Justin, Justin.

14:12.440 --> 14:15.240
Pretty much, because I have to eat like a garbage person.

14:15.240 --> 14:16.080
What?

14:16.080 --> 14:16.920
No, this is a bad diet.

14:16.920 --> 14:19.240
So that's why I was so excited

14:19.240 --> 14:20.880
and why at six a.m. this morning,

14:20.880 --> 14:22.480
when Griffin woke up and used the bathroom,

14:22.480 --> 14:24.920
I was sitting in my bed with a laptop on my lap

14:24.920 --> 14:26.120
and Griffin said, what are you doing?

14:26.120 --> 14:28.360
I said, I'm looking at donuts.

14:28.360 --> 14:30.960
Because I was planning to eat my donuts

14:30.960 --> 14:32.400
like a garbage person.

14:32.400 --> 14:36.800
This is a, did you consult a physician or a teacher?

14:36.800 --> 14:40.000
Yeah, I got one that I know pretty well.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.600
Okay, all right.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.320
Can we, you want to get back to the question?

14:43.320 --> 14:44.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:44.160 --> 14:47.160
Okay, so where were we?

14:47.160 --> 14:48.000
Good, you guys are good.

14:48.000 --> 14:48.960
Bus boy to popular chain restaurant.

14:48.960 --> 14:51.000
Bus boy to popular chain restaurant needs my advice.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.040
Work long shifts that begin early in the morning

14:53.040 --> 14:54.360
and late in the afternoon with no break

14:54.360 --> 14:56.080
and I have a tendency to skimp on breakfast.

14:56.080 --> 14:58.440
About a week ago, I was five-ish hours into a shift

14:58.440 --> 15:01.160
after having eaten nothing but banana in the morning

15:01.160 --> 15:02.920
and I was getting to the hunger level

15:02.920 --> 15:04.360
where I started to feel sick.

15:04.360 --> 15:05.440
Seeing no other options,

15:05.440 --> 15:09.800
I took an untouched plate of biscuits back into the kitchen

15:09.800 --> 15:11.360
and had a couple bites.

15:11.360 --> 15:15.240
It took me to join this and quickly went back to work.

15:15.240 --> 15:16.760
When I got home, I recounted the dark deed

15:16.760 --> 15:17.760
I had committed to my friends

15:17.760 --> 15:19.480
and they said, not only is it not gross

15:19.480 --> 15:21.080
to eat a stranger's unwanted food,

15:21.080 --> 15:23.440
but they encouraged me to do it all the time

15:23.440 --> 15:25.640
and with foods that are tastier than the biscuits.

15:25.640 --> 15:27.460
Not applicable, but fine.

15:27.460 --> 15:30.520
I love my friends, but I have seen them eat off the ground

15:30.520 --> 15:32.060
and out of the trash.

15:32.060 --> 15:33.920
So I don't really trust their judgment here.

15:33.920 --> 15:35.000
My friends are raccoons.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.280
How am I for doing what I did?

15:37.280 --> 15:39.160
Should I throw away all caution and dignity in the wind

15:39.160 --> 15:41.320
and eat a Rando's mac and cheese?

15:41.320 --> 15:43.440
That's from Damiao.

15:43.440 --> 15:45.240
The thing is, is this is fine

15:45.240 --> 15:48.440
right up until the point where you are observant.

15:48.440 --> 15:49.280
Yes.

15:49.280 --> 15:51.480
It's like, yeah, okay, you ate a bite off that thing, cool.

15:51.480 --> 15:53.800
Now picture that, but your boss is there?

15:53.800 --> 15:54.680
Or is this fine?

15:54.680 --> 15:59.320
Or I'm so on the side of just eat the fucking food.

15:59.320 --> 16:00.980
Don't throw good food in a garbage can.

16:00.980 --> 16:01.820
That's so wasteful.

16:01.820 --> 16:03.120
We're a huge waste in this country.

16:03.120 --> 16:05.080
But if I go to Bob Evans

16:05.080 --> 16:07.160
and those were my biscuits that I bought and paid for

16:07.160 --> 16:09.740
and then I leave and I'm like, oh, I left my coat.

16:09.740 --> 16:10.840
I gotta go get my coat back.

16:10.840 --> 16:15.840
And I walk back in and I see you eating my fucking biscuits.

16:15.920 --> 16:17.400
I would shout, I would point at you

16:17.400 --> 16:20.520
and I would shout, thief, thief, thief.

16:20.520 --> 16:22.560
Oh, this should be like in ride sharing

16:22.560 --> 16:24.960
where it's like, if you share a lift with someone

16:24.960 --> 16:26.080
you split the cost.

16:26.080 --> 16:27.360
You can have those biscuits,

16:27.360 --> 16:29.040
but half of those biscuits are going on your bill now.

16:29.040 --> 16:31.320
Holy shit, Travis.

16:31.320 --> 16:32.160
Okay.

16:32.160 --> 16:33.280
Biscuit app.

16:33.280 --> 16:36.080
Biscuit, B-S-K-T is the app.

16:36.080 --> 16:36.920
And here's the app.

16:36.920 --> 16:38.240
Biscuit does not have a K in it.

16:38.240 --> 16:40.360
It does now, it's so cool.

16:40.360 --> 16:41.760
We're shortening it to biscuit.

16:41.760 --> 16:43.160
Shortening, shortening it.

16:43.160 --> 16:44.000
There's something there.

16:44.000 --> 16:44.820
There's something there.

16:44.820 --> 16:45.660
There's something there.

16:45.660 --> 16:46.480
We'll get to it.

16:46.480 --> 16:48.840
You push the button on biscuit.

16:48.840 --> 16:49.680
Biscuit.

16:49.680 --> 16:50.520
When you say I have.

16:50.520 --> 16:51.880
It shows you the nearest uneaten biscuit.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.120
No, it's the inverse.

16:53.120 --> 16:54.440
It's both.

16:54.440 --> 16:55.860
There's two sides of it.

16:55.860 --> 16:58.280
So if you have a bunch of unfinished touch food

16:58.280 --> 16:59.520
and it's like, oh God, I feel terrible

16:59.520 --> 17:01.120
about throwing this away.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.200
Press the biscuit.

17:02.200 --> 17:03.840
You load up biscuit and you load it and say,

17:03.840 --> 17:05.160
I got some grub here.

17:05.160 --> 17:08.080
And you put a little flag or something

17:08.080 --> 17:09.240
so they don't get rid of it.

17:09.240 --> 17:10.520
And then if you're hungry

17:10.520 --> 17:11.920
and you don't want to pay for the food,

17:11.920 --> 17:12.760
you press the button.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.200
It's like, where's some food around here?

17:14.200 --> 17:15.320
And it connects.

17:15.320 --> 17:16.160
It's connected.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.480
But then you have to go to the Bob Evans

17:17.480 --> 17:19.600
and be like, sir, table for one?

17:19.600 --> 17:21.480
It's like, no, don't worry about me.

17:21.480 --> 17:24.400
I was led to believe there were some loose

17:24.400 --> 17:25.240
rogue biscuits.

17:25.240 --> 17:26.060
Listen, listen, listen.

17:26.060 --> 17:29.120
I'm operating outside of your traditional restaurant norms.

17:29.120 --> 17:30.520
Don't worry about me.

17:32.100 --> 17:33.080
Don't even think about me.

17:33.080 --> 17:35.080
I don't mind sharing a table.

17:35.080 --> 17:39.360
I've worked a couple of different breakfast restaurants before

17:39.360 --> 17:40.760
and a couple of different iterations.

17:40.760 --> 17:44.240
And I have stolen food before it's made it

17:44.240 --> 17:45.880
to someone's plate.

17:45.880 --> 17:46.720
What?

17:46.720 --> 17:50.800
Like, I worked at a hotel breakfast restaurant place

17:50.800 --> 17:53.760
where they just had like a bunch of like Danishes

17:53.760 --> 17:54.600
and I would just eat them.

17:54.600 --> 17:55.880
Like they were just there.

17:55.880 --> 17:57.600
But this is not made to order.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.440
No, no, no, no.

17:58.440 --> 17:59.280
These are just Danish.

17:59.280 --> 18:00.880
No, but I definitely worked at the Olive Garden

18:00.880 --> 18:02.200
and I definitely a few times was like,

18:02.200 --> 18:04.040
ooh, future mini calamari on this plate.

18:04.040 --> 18:07.160
Don't wanna, and then just snap.

18:07.160 --> 18:09.040
That's called the angel's share.

18:09.040 --> 18:11.400
The angel's share of calamari.

18:11.400 --> 18:14.040
We talk a lot about our former jobs.

18:14.040 --> 18:16.560
And this is a question that maybe a legal law person

18:16.560 --> 18:17.680
could answer for us.

18:17.680 --> 18:21.600
But is it possible to get after fired in some way?

18:21.600 --> 18:22.440
Post-fired, yeah.

18:22.440 --> 18:24.600
Post-fired, because we're sort of braggadocious

18:24.600 --> 18:26.920
about our little Robin Hood-esque acts.

18:26.920 --> 18:29.240
I actually think I'm beyond statute of limitations.

18:29.240 --> 18:30.080
Oh, defo.

18:30.080 --> 18:30.900
Yeah, fine.

18:30.900 --> 18:34.000
When I quit that breakfast restaurant hotel place,

18:34.000 --> 18:36.720
I just took two boxes of frozen Danishes with me.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.160
That was my severance.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.360
That was my breakfast severance.

18:39.360 --> 18:44.360
They, the best thing about working at the Olive Garden

18:45.040 --> 18:48.280
is every few weeks, well, not every few weeks,

18:48.280 --> 18:51.440
cause it wouldn't have had to be every few days.

18:51.440 --> 18:54.400
They serve chicken tenders for kids at the Olive Garden,

18:54.400 --> 18:56.780
but they come frozen, right?

18:56.780 --> 19:01.780
And some of the tenders would break or into smaller pieces.

19:01.780 --> 19:05.660
So after you distributed all the tenders,

19:05.660 --> 19:08.580
you would be left with, at the bottom of the bag,

19:08.580 --> 19:10.300
just some unservable nugs.

19:10.300 --> 19:11.140
Some chicken leave-ins.

19:11.140 --> 19:13.980
Because we didn't have nuggets, we had tenders.

19:13.980 --> 19:16.380
So the best day of all of our lives

19:16.380 --> 19:19.260
is we would just dump all those into the fryer,

19:19.260 --> 19:20.340
and that was like nudge day.

19:20.340 --> 19:21.180
Ah, damn.

19:21.180 --> 19:22.000
At Olive Garden.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.140
And you bring them out and everybody's like,

19:23.140 --> 19:24.760
guys, nudge day, nudge day.

19:24.760 --> 19:25.600
Guys, nudge day, nudge day.

19:25.600 --> 19:26.420
Guys, nudge day, nudge day.

19:26.420 --> 19:29.740
When I worked at the coffee shop that was also a restaurant,

19:29.740 --> 19:32.620
you could have like one meal while you were working.

19:32.620 --> 19:35.140
But the benefit was you made the meal yourself,

19:35.140 --> 19:36.620
so you could just go off menu and be like,

19:36.620 --> 19:39.860
yeah, I had a sandwich stuffed with french fries and stuff.

19:39.860 --> 19:41.940
And you would just put whatever you wanted to into your meal

19:41.940 --> 19:43.860
and you'd just end up with like a plate piled with food

19:43.860 --> 19:44.700
that was free.

19:44.700 --> 19:46.300
There's that nasty air conditioner again.

19:46.300 --> 19:48.220
When I was at Travis, turn the air conditioner off.

19:48.220 --> 19:50.220
Please turn the air, oh, you can't, you're strapped in.

19:50.220 --> 19:53.320
Wait, this is a fun little folk game we've got now.

19:53.320 --> 19:54.420
It's like the Maypole.

19:54.420 --> 19:55.740
Can Travis get to the air conditioner?

19:55.740 --> 19:57.180
I can just unhook the lav.

19:57.180 --> 19:58.020
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

19:58.020 --> 19:58.840
Nope, don't you dare.

19:58.840 --> 19:59.680
Don't you dare unplug from-

19:59.680 --> 20:00.780
I'm gonna pull my Zoom off the thing.

20:00.780 --> 20:01.620
Come on, don't pull it off.

20:01.620 --> 20:02.440
I'm gonna try it.

20:02.440 --> 20:03.280
Do it, Travis.

20:03.280 --> 20:04.120
It's right there.

20:04.120 --> 20:04.960
You're right there.

20:04.960 --> 20:05.780
Yeah, it's right there, just turn the fan off.

20:05.780 --> 20:06.620
God, this is like gravity.

20:06.620 --> 20:07.460
There we go.

20:07.460 --> 20:08.460
I've done it.

20:08.460 --> 20:11.340
When I was at, oh God.

20:11.340 --> 20:12.300
When I was at Target-

20:12.300 --> 20:14.260
They sweep in the hallway?

20:14.260 --> 20:16.300
I was at Target the night before

20:16.300 --> 20:18.540
we went on the JoCo cruise.

20:18.540 --> 20:21.860
And as I'm at Target and I'm taking Charlie up

20:21.860 --> 20:25.340
to get a juice, we don't let her have juice a lot

20:25.340 --> 20:26.620
because it's made of fruit

20:26.620 --> 20:28.060
and we all know how that is for you.

20:28.060 --> 20:28.900
Yeah.

20:28.900 --> 20:30.580
And as I was going up to the juice,

20:30.580 --> 20:34.380
I saw a lady who worked at Target

20:34.380 --> 20:37.580
eating a single hot dog on a plate

20:37.580 --> 20:39.180
because I think that was the Target meal

20:39.180 --> 20:41.980
and she was just flipping through pictures of her baby

20:41.980 --> 20:43.300
while she ate a hot dog.

20:43.300 --> 20:44.120
That's nice.

20:44.120 --> 20:44.960
And I was like, that's nice.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.180
That seems really nice.

20:46.180 --> 20:48.380
And then later she checked me out and I was like,

20:48.380 --> 20:49.220
I didn't want to-

20:49.220 --> 20:51.620
She was like, hey, good looking, what you got cooking?

20:51.620 --> 20:52.440
I didn't want to mention it.

20:52.440 --> 20:53.280
That's gotta be jelly

20:53.280 --> 20:54.180
because jam don't shake like that.

20:54.180 --> 20:56.380
I saw you eating a hot dog and I wanted to say like,

20:56.380 --> 20:58.900
hey, did you like your hot dog?

20:58.900 --> 20:59.740
Was that a good hot dog?

20:59.740 --> 21:01.020
But I feel like there's some-

21:01.020 --> 21:04.240
Wait, you wouldn't say that to any other human being ever.

21:04.240 --> 21:05.080
So why would you do that to the person at Target?

21:05.080 --> 21:07.340
But I knew that she had just enjoyed a hot dog.

21:07.340 --> 21:08.300
Yeah.

21:08.300 --> 21:09.420
What's better, Dustin,

21:09.420 --> 21:11.900
her eating a hot dog and flipping pictures of her baby

21:11.900 --> 21:14.460
or her holding her baby and flipping pictures of hot dogs?

21:14.460 --> 21:19.020
Okay, we've solved this one.

21:19.020 --> 21:20.160
Yeah, how about a Yahoo?

21:20.160 --> 21:21.000
Yeah.

21:21.000 --> 21:21.820
This one was sent in by Drew Campbell.

21:21.820 --> 21:22.660
Thank you, Drew.

21:22.660 --> 21:23.480
It's Yahoo Answers user.

21:23.480 --> 21:25.900
Sorry, something's gone wrong, but we'll call him.

21:25.900 --> 21:26.740
Jerm.

21:26.740 --> 21:27.580
Jerm.

21:27.580 --> 21:29.780
I just realized I could stand like Seth Rometelli does.

21:29.780 --> 21:32.340
Oh yeah, you got that Seth Rowe style.

21:32.340 --> 21:33.500
This one was asked by Jerms.

21:33.500 --> 21:34.340
All right, that's over with.

21:34.340 --> 21:36.460
Well, that was fun.

21:36.460 --> 21:37.300
Time to sit back down.

21:37.300 --> 21:40.980
Jerms asks, do you like people generally

21:40.980 --> 21:42.580
or would you rather kick some butt?

21:42.580 --> 21:59.380
It's in the new Predator movie, that's the first scene, one Predator says to another one, hey, do you like people generally or do you want to kick some butt?

21:59.380 --> 22:01.860
I mean, I think this is something that the big beefcake,

22:01.860 --> 22:05.020
the big beefcakes say to each other, like, I just don't like people.

22:05.020 --> 22:06.220
I'd rather kick some butt.

22:06.220 --> 22:07.700
I just don't like people generally.

22:07.700 --> 22:08.540
Generally speaking.

22:08.540 --> 22:09.380
Generally speaking.

22:09.380 --> 22:12.740
Show me 10 people, I will dislike at least six of them.

22:12.740 --> 22:14.940
And the other four, I'll kick their butts.

22:14.940 --> 22:15.780
Or, wait.

22:15.780 --> 22:18.460
Do you like people generally or would you rather kick some butt?

22:18.460 --> 22:19.420
This is a tough one, isn't it?

22:19.420 --> 22:29.060
Cause like, in today, in today, in today, I look around and I'm like, I'm not, I want to stay, I want to stay positive, right?

22:29.060 --> 22:31.540
And like, accept everybody, all walks of life.

22:31.540 --> 22:36.260
But I also see like more and more people that I think like, I don't like you generally,

22:36.260 --> 22:39.140
and I think I'd rather kick your butt, and I don't advocate violence.

22:39.140 --> 22:41.140
I don't think the two are mutually exclusive.

22:41.140 --> 22:45.580
I like people generally, and I would also like to kick some butt.

22:45.580 --> 22:46.420
Justin, I'm sorry.

22:46.420 --> 22:51.620
I wish that were true, but I would like to cite a great media precedent for this.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.660
It's the hit film, Street Fighter.

22:53.660 --> 22:54.100
Yeah.

22:54.100 --> 23:00.460
And when they're making Blanca, if I remember correctly, they make him 51% good,

23:00.460 --> 23:02.900
so he doesn't just go around murdering everyone all the time.

23:02.900 --> 23:03.420
Okay.

23:03.420 --> 23:05.860
So that's the question is, do you like people 51%?

23:05.860 --> 23:10.420
So did you recently watch Street Fighter and just think like, boy, I got to think of a way to reference this in the podcast?

23:10.420 --> 23:13.380
No, Griffin, I haven't seen it since it first aired in theaters.

23:13.380 --> 23:15.940
That moment just always really stuck with me.

23:15.940 --> 23:21.660
There's one really sick line in Street Fighter's movie when Bison is talking to Chun-Li, I think it is,

23:21.660 --> 23:29.780
and he says, the day that M. Bison destroyed your village was the most important day of your life.

23:29.780 --> 23:33.100
To me, it was Tuesday.

23:33.100 --> 23:34.860
It's so rad.

23:34.860 --> 23:36.300
It's like a sick line.

23:36.300 --> 23:37.060
It's a good way to say it.

23:37.060 --> 23:40.780
Did they bring in one, they brought in Shane Black to write, listen, Shane, it's me.

23:40.780 --> 23:41.900
Shane, write this one line.

23:41.900 --> 23:43.700
Write one line about the movie.

23:43.700 --> 23:48.220
I really liked the line where M. Bison's talking to, I think it was Ryu, and he says,

23:48.220 --> 23:54.940
I don't like people generally, I'd rather kick some butt.

23:54.940 --> 23:56.700
Does this mean, does this, okay.

23:56.700 --> 23:58.540
It sounds like Shredder.

23:58.540 --> 23:59.660
It sounds like Master Shredder.

23:59.660 --> 24:00.340
Yeah.

24:00.340 --> 24:01.540
I don't like people.

24:01.540 --> 24:04.740
I don't like turtles generally, I'd rather kick some butt.

24:04.740 --> 24:09.540
I mean, I've met some nice one, definitely, that I have liked, but like on the whole.

24:09.540 --> 24:13.740
Charlie, by the way, this question's from nine years ago.

24:13.740 --> 24:20.780
This was before fucking George W. Bush was president, and people were really,

24:20.780 --> 24:24.020
and he was on his way out, and people were really thinking about kicking some butt.

24:24.020 --> 24:28.140
Charlie says, I like some people, but some people are just a lost cause,

24:28.140 --> 24:31.860
and me thinks that a kick in the butt would not cure them.

24:31.860 --> 24:33.380
Need something much more effective.

24:33.380 --> 24:36.100
Hmm, let me think what we should do.

24:36.100 --> 24:36.620
Charlie.

24:36.620 --> 24:37.340
Kill them, Charlie.

24:37.340 --> 24:38.700
Are you talking about murder, Charlie?

24:38.700 --> 24:44.820
DA Charlie, do you think murder, and also, I think if you ever type the word me thinks,

24:44.820 --> 24:46.780
your computer should explode.

24:46.780 --> 24:49.860
Well, you should have just written me thinks and like Clippy Pops.

24:49.860 --> 24:53.180
I was like, you might be one of the people people dislike generally.

24:53.180 --> 24:53.740
Bye.

24:53.740 --> 24:55.020
We, hi there.

24:55.020 --> 24:58.340
It seems like you're making things worse for everybody.

24:58.340 --> 25:02.060
Do you want to shape up or shape out?

25:02.060 --> 25:03.580
Okay, I have another question here.

25:03.580 --> 25:04.940
No, no, Justin.

25:04.940 --> 25:06.100
Oh, no.

25:06.100 --> 25:08.220
No, it's time.

25:08.220 --> 25:11.300
It's time for our first Max Fun Drive break.

25:11.300 --> 25:12.700
It's our first Max Fun Drive break.

25:12.700 --> 25:13.900
Take a break now.

25:13.900 --> 25:15.100
Pledge gifts this year.

25:15.100 --> 25:16.100
Well, let's talk about the Max Fun Drive.

25:16.100 --> 25:18.220
So we're on this, I'm going to give you the short version.

25:18.220 --> 25:19.620
We're on a network called Maximum Fun.

25:19.620 --> 25:21.620
They make a lot of great podcasts.

25:21.620 --> 25:22.900
Been here for seven years.

25:22.900 --> 25:24.380
Been here for seven years.

25:24.380 --> 25:25.260
That's wild, man.

25:25.260 --> 25:25.860
I can't believe that.

25:25.860 --> 25:26.780
They never get rid of us.

25:26.780 --> 25:32.980
And this is a network funded by you, the listeners.

25:32.980 --> 25:34.620
And that's how we pay the bills around here.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.660
We also do advertisements, which you hear on the show,

25:36.660 --> 25:39.300
but those are, those pale in comparison

25:39.300 --> 25:43.180
to what we get from donations from viewers like you.

25:43.180 --> 25:44.180
This would not run.

25:44.180 --> 25:45.580
And the James L. Knight Foundation.

25:45.580 --> 25:47.380
This would not run on advertising alone.

25:47.380 --> 25:49.540
We need you to support us.

25:49.540 --> 25:52.420
And so at once a year, we come to you and say, hat in hand,

25:52.420 --> 25:54.300
and say, hey, if you like the stuff you're listening to

25:54.300 --> 25:57.500
on the network, please, could you pay a little bit for it?

25:57.500 --> 25:58.700
What does that look like?

25:58.700 --> 26:01.500
Well, we're talking about you pledging a certain amount

26:01.500 --> 26:04.660
that you can afford to pay every month.

26:04.660 --> 26:07.900
If you pledge just $5, you are going

26:07.900 --> 26:10.740
to get exclusive bonus content.

26:10.740 --> 26:13.020
And I'll be honest, at this point,

26:13.020 --> 26:16.060
it is a lot of bonus content.

26:16.060 --> 26:17.860
I mean, it's seven years of my brother, my brother,

26:17.860 --> 26:18.900
and me bonus content.

26:18.900 --> 26:20.820
Three of Adventure Zone.

26:20.820 --> 26:22.060
There's videos.

26:22.060 --> 26:26.100
There's an exclusive clip from our CISO show

26:26.100 --> 26:27.420
that you can't find anywhere else.

26:27.420 --> 26:27.980
There is?

26:27.980 --> 26:28.900
Yeah, I set that up.

26:28.900 --> 26:31.100
It's like an exclusive clip from the CISO show.

26:31.100 --> 26:36.260
It's Chiccarelli before the teens.

26:36.260 --> 26:38.540
Oh, fuck me, that's good stuff.

26:38.540 --> 26:40.220
And you get all that, plus episodes

26:40.220 --> 26:41.460
of all the other shows.

26:41.460 --> 26:43.380
Every show on the network does a bonus episode.

26:43.380 --> 26:45.140
There's tons of great stuff.

26:45.140 --> 26:47.500
Sidney and I, for our show Sawbones this year,

26:47.500 --> 26:50.300
did just an hour about goop.

26:50.300 --> 26:52.100
Just talked about goop for an hour.

26:52.100 --> 26:52.940
The Gwyneth Paltrow thing?

26:52.940 --> 26:53.420
Yes.

26:53.420 --> 26:54.740
Oh, man.

26:54.740 --> 26:56.020
That sounds like a required list.

26:56.020 --> 26:57.900
Well, let's write it down then.

26:57.900 --> 27:00.500
My brother, my brother, and me, we did Your Three Dads,

27:00.500 --> 27:01.780
an episode about us being dad.

27:01.780 --> 27:03.060
OK, no, just full transparency.

27:03.060 --> 27:04.780
Did you see the art that I made for Your Three Dads,

27:04.780 --> 27:05.180
by the way?

27:05.180 --> 27:05.660
No.

27:05.660 --> 27:08.100
It's really very good stuff.

27:08.100 --> 27:10.100
Full transparency, it's the worst of the bonus

27:10.100 --> 27:11.060
content of this year.

27:11.060 --> 27:12.100
Oh, it's so bad.

27:12.100 --> 27:16.220
It was a pit for us to pour sort of our fatherly exhaustion

27:16.220 --> 27:20.700
into just a big cup full of our very tired brew.

27:20.700 --> 27:21.620
A lot of gadgets.

27:21.620 --> 27:24.900
For Rose Buddies, we talked to The Bachelorette Canada.

27:24.900 --> 27:27.900
Jasmine Lorimer did an interview with her about life

27:27.900 --> 27:29.180
after being The Bachelorette.

27:29.180 --> 27:30.740
That was really, really fun.

27:30.740 --> 27:34.620
For Schmanners, we watched and reviewed

27:34.620 --> 27:36.860
series five of Great British Bake Off.

27:36.860 --> 27:37.580
Oh, nice.

27:37.580 --> 27:38.500
Ooh, nice.

27:38.500 --> 27:39.260
Trends like these.

27:39.260 --> 27:40.060
The whole series?

27:40.060 --> 27:40.980
What a bargain.

27:40.980 --> 27:45.220
We talked about the trends from 1900 to 1920.

27:45.220 --> 27:48.060
If times are tight, we fucking totally, totally get it.

27:48.060 --> 27:50.140
And really, we don't.

27:50.140 --> 27:52.340
There are people who are like, I can only do $5 a month.

27:52.340 --> 27:53.100
That's awesome.

27:53.100 --> 27:56.780
Just the fact that you would support us in that way

27:56.780 --> 27:58.660
is incredible.

27:58.660 --> 28:01.940
And we don't care how much you give.

28:01.940 --> 28:05.380
It's just I was a supporter of the network

28:05.380 --> 28:07.300
before we were on the network.

28:07.300 --> 28:12.420
And it was just because I was a big JJ Go fan.

28:12.420 --> 28:14.700
And I just wanted to be a supporter of this thing

28:14.700 --> 28:15.500
that I really liked.

28:15.500 --> 28:16.460
And it felt really good.

28:16.460 --> 28:19.300
And so if you listen to our shows

28:19.300 --> 28:20.820
and you want to feel some ownership

28:20.820 --> 28:23.380
over this really cool thing that we've all made together,

28:23.380 --> 28:24.620
then this is the way to do it.

28:24.620 --> 28:25.500
Just a couple others.

28:25.500 --> 28:26.660
And we'll talk about more later.

28:26.660 --> 28:28.180
But if you can pledge $10, you're

28:28.180 --> 28:30.620
going to get a drive-exclusive enamel pin

28:30.620 --> 28:32.340
designed by Megan Lencott.

28:32.340 --> 28:35.060
If you've ever seen the, I think it was a calendar,

28:35.060 --> 28:38.220
but designs of all the Max Fun Shows as cats.

28:38.220 --> 28:39.060
This is this.

28:39.060 --> 28:41.660
And last year was the bandanas with the individual designs

28:41.660 --> 28:42.140
on them.

28:42.140 --> 28:42.640
Yeah.

28:42.640 --> 28:44.220
This year, we've got cool pins.

28:44.220 --> 28:44.740
For $20.

28:44.740 --> 28:46.820
For Mip and Bam, it's a snake that says Zag on them.

28:46.820 --> 28:47.620
It's really good.

28:47.620 --> 28:48.660
It's fucking sweet.

28:48.660 --> 28:50.660
There's a Keep in Touch kit at $20.

28:50.660 --> 28:54.100
You get the other stuff, plus custom note cards and envelopes

28:54.100 --> 28:57.420
and a four-color rocket pin, a rocket stamp,

28:57.420 --> 29:01.300
a rocket-shaped candle that smells like sharpened pencil,

29:01.300 --> 29:03.620
friendship, and a little bit of wax because it's a candle.

29:03.620 --> 29:04.420
Those are $20.

29:04.420 --> 29:07.100
And if you're already a donor, first off, thank you.

29:07.100 --> 29:08.900
Secondly, you can get these gifts

29:08.900 --> 29:10.700
if you just upgrade to the next level.

29:10.700 --> 29:12.900
So if you're a $5 member right now, upgraded $10,

29:12.900 --> 29:13.700
you're going to get.

29:13.700 --> 29:16.180
And if you become a $20 donor, you

29:16.180 --> 29:18.220
get the gifts at $10 and $5.

29:18.220 --> 29:19.660
And it all stacks up.

29:19.660 --> 29:23.020
But also, our goal for this time, for this go-ground,

29:23.020 --> 29:24.580
is 10,000, which I'd say is.

29:24.580 --> 29:26.100
New donors, not dollars.

29:26.100 --> 29:27.900
Yeah, 10,000 new and upgrading donors.

29:27.900 --> 29:30.500
I shit $10,000.

29:30.500 --> 29:32.060
And it's a pretty ambitious goal,

29:32.060 --> 29:34.940
but we more or less hit it last year.

29:34.940 --> 29:37.700
Last year, we were like 9,800.

29:37.700 --> 29:38.540
Let's do it.

29:38.540 --> 29:40.060
So let's do it.

29:40.060 --> 29:41.820
There's a bunch of new shows on the network,

29:41.820 --> 29:43.980
and I'm optimistic we can get the Rosebuddies.

29:43.980 --> 29:45.180
This is Rosebuddies' first year.

29:45.180 --> 29:49.100
And we do a lot of shows, and we get a lot of people who ask us,

29:49.100 --> 29:50.740
how do you guys do so much stuff?

29:50.740 --> 29:53.620
The answer to that is, we are able to make a career out

29:53.620 --> 29:57.180
of it because of the donations we get from the next one.

29:57.180 --> 30:00.860
Your money also goes straight to the shows

30:00.860 --> 30:02.020
that you listen to.

30:02.020 --> 30:03.340
Yeah, you choose the shows you listen

30:03.340 --> 30:04.300
to, what you want to support.

30:04.300 --> 30:05.620
Right, and a portion goes to MaxFun,

30:05.620 --> 30:07.860
and the rest of it is just split up among those shows.

30:07.860 --> 30:09.580
So you're directly supporting shows

30:09.580 --> 30:11.340
by saying you listen to them.

30:11.340 --> 30:13.580
We'll talk more about this in a bit, but for right now,

30:13.580 --> 30:17.220
go to MaximumFun.org and click Donate.

30:17.220 --> 30:20.220
That's MaximumFun.org.

30:20.220 --> 30:22.420
And click on Donate, choose the membership level

30:22.420 --> 30:24.260
that's right for you, give them your credit card

30:24.260 --> 30:26.780
and other basic information, and just like that,

30:26.780 --> 30:27.660
you'll be a member.

30:27.660 --> 30:30.420
But if you become a new and upgrading donor,

30:30.420 --> 30:33.100
new or upgrading donor, make sure to let us know.

30:33.100 --> 30:36.060
Tweet at us, put it in our Facebook group, something,

30:36.060 --> 30:37.780
so we can say thank you.

30:37.780 --> 30:38.660
And get involved.

30:38.660 --> 30:39.140
There's going to be this.

30:39.140 --> 30:40.940
Jesus, Travis, that sounds like a lot of work.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.500
Travis will certainly say thank you.

30:42.500 --> 30:45.220
Yeah, one of our many underlings will do it.

30:45.220 --> 30:46.500
We'll make our babies do it.

30:46.500 --> 30:50.100
I'm going to have my social media manager.

30:50.100 --> 30:51.980
Also, there's going to be MaxFun Meetup Days,

30:51.980 --> 30:54.100
and special events, and live events.

30:54.100 --> 30:54.980
There's a ton of stuff.

30:54.980 --> 30:55.940
Support stuff you love.

30:55.940 --> 31:01.580
OK, another question here from, well, I'll tell you in a second.

31:01.580 --> 31:02.820
Yeah, we'll get there.

31:02.820 --> 31:03.300
We'll get there.

31:03.300 --> 31:03.940
Don't rush me.

31:03.940 --> 31:05.900
I've never been very social at work

31:05.900 --> 31:07.620
outside my immediate team members.

31:07.620 --> 31:09.060
Today, while walking down the hall,

31:09.060 --> 31:13.420
two guys pointed me out with an audible, hey, it's that guy.

31:13.420 --> 31:15.100
I have never spoken to either of these men

31:15.100 --> 31:16.940
outside a courtesy nod in passing,

31:16.940 --> 31:18.380
and do not even know their names.

31:18.380 --> 31:19.860
How should I take this address?

31:19.860 --> 31:20.900
Oh, man.

31:20.900 --> 31:25.300
What could have labeled me as that guy, and how can I own it?

31:25.300 --> 31:28.100
And that's from that guy in that office.

31:28.100 --> 31:28.860
Something bad.

31:28.860 --> 31:29.700
It's not good, right?

31:29.700 --> 31:31.500
I think we can all agree this is not good.

31:31.500 --> 31:32.340
It's not good.

31:32.340 --> 31:34.100
This is something that would really eat at me.

31:34.100 --> 31:35.340
If I was just walking down the street,

31:35.340 --> 31:37.980
and somebody just randomly went, hey, hey, it's that guy,

31:37.980 --> 31:40.380
and kept going, I'd be like, what do you mean?

31:40.380 --> 31:41.140
What?

31:41.140 --> 31:41.700
What do you mean?

31:41.700 --> 31:42.340
What are you saying?

31:42.340 --> 31:45.700
And I think that would live with me for 20 years.

31:45.700 --> 31:48.140
I got to ask, and this is a tough question,

31:48.140 --> 31:50.060
and you may not be ready to answer right now.

31:50.060 --> 31:51.260
And if you're not, that's fine.

31:51.260 --> 31:53.700
And if the answer is yes, then no judgment.

31:53.700 --> 31:56.420
But are you Numa Numa?

31:56.420 --> 31:57.780
Are you the Numa Numa guy?

31:57.780 --> 32:00.460
Hey, are you the Numa Numa guy?

32:00.460 --> 32:02.580
Is there a way to search for yourself to make sure you're not

32:02.580 --> 32:04.180
a meme?

32:04.180 --> 32:04.820
I'm going to search.

32:04.820 --> 32:07.100
That's the thing, these days, everybody

32:07.100 --> 32:08.580
can be everybody's memes.

32:08.580 --> 32:10.820
I mean, somewhere there's a meme for every human being.

32:10.820 --> 32:12.860
The snake ate its own tail.

32:12.860 --> 32:15.820
Drew Scanlan, a guy I know, a giant bomb.

32:15.820 --> 32:18.340
Oh my god, he's the biggest meme in the universe.

32:18.340 --> 32:21.020
Have you seen the guy blinking?

32:21.020 --> 32:22.060
That's Drew Scanlan.

32:22.060 --> 32:22.780
He works at Giant Bomb.

32:22.780 --> 32:24.380
It's from one of the Giant Bomb videos.

32:24.380 --> 32:27.300
And it was like, oh no, memes are happening to real people

32:27.300 --> 32:27.820
now.

32:27.820 --> 32:28.940
They're not just made up people.

32:28.940 --> 32:30.020
Real people are being memed.

32:30.020 --> 32:31.660
Everybody's being memed all the time.

32:31.660 --> 32:32.140
Be careful.

32:32.140 --> 32:34.100
Maybe you're a meme, and you don't even know it yet.

32:34.100 --> 32:35.500
And the thing is, when you become a meme,

32:35.500 --> 32:36.580
you can't take that back.

32:36.580 --> 32:38.460
You can't un-meme yourself.

32:38.460 --> 32:40.180
Maybe they were just saying it randomly.

32:40.180 --> 32:43.100
You know, like, just being weird.

32:43.100 --> 32:44.860
Sometimes people just do weird stuff.

32:44.860 --> 32:45.380
Yeah.

32:45.380 --> 32:46.940
You know that one scene in Austin Powers?

32:46.940 --> 32:47.300
Uh-huh.

32:47.300 --> 32:48.380
It's early in the movie.

32:48.380 --> 32:50.380
And Austin's like, there you are.

32:50.380 --> 32:51.860
And you can do that better.

32:51.860 --> 32:53.340
There you are.

32:53.340 --> 32:54.780
You can do that way better.

32:54.780 --> 32:55.940
That's what I'm saying.

32:55.940 --> 32:57.460
There you are.

32:57.460 --> 32:58.260
There you are.

32:58.260 --> 32:59.060
Yeah, baby.

32:59.060 --> 32:59.860
You're doing this like.

32:59.860 --> 33:02.060
I mean, it's hard to do, like, three words at the same time.

33:02.060 --> 33:03.060
Hello, there you are.

33:03.060 --> 33:05.060
It sounds a lot like Austin Powers.

33:05.060 --> 33:07.220
It's me, Austin Powers, isn't it?

33:07.220 --> 33:08.220
There you are.

33:08.220 --> 33:13.460
Oh, Jim, and he's, me mojo's gone all wanky.

33:13.460 --> 33:14.980
Let me finish my point.

33:14.980 --> 33:18.620
So Austin's like, there you are.

33:18.620 --> 33:20.060
Like, that's better.

33:20.060 --> 33:21.740
And the woman's like, do I know you?

33:21.740 --> 33:24.220
And he's like, no, but that's where you are.

33:24.220 --> 33:25.780
You're there.

33:25.780 --> 33:26.300
And, um.

33:26.300 --> 33:28.460
Fuck, that's funny.

33:28.460 --> 33:31.140
So the thing I wanted to make, the point I was trying

33:31.140 --> 33:33.100
to make with that is, don't you think

33:33.100 --> 33:36.020
we should make another Austin Powers movie?

33:36.020 --> 33:36.820
OK, listen.

33:36.820 --> 33:38.540
We're finally all in a room together.

33:38.540 --> 33:39.460
We've got some time on our hands.

33:39.460 --> 33:40.980
Yeah, I'm shutting my computer.

33:40.980 --> 33:43.020
We're going to pitch Austin Powers 4 right now.

33:43.020 --> 33:45.580
This is our backdoor pilot for Austin Powers 4.

33:45.580 --> 33:46.060
OK.

33:46.060 --> 33:46.980
We've got to get back to basics.

33:46.980 --> 33:48.340
It's got to be Son of Austin Powers.

33:48.340 --> 33:48.940
It's got to have a son.

33:48.940 --> 33:49.340
Got to have a son.

33:49.340 --> 33:49.740
Got to have a son.

33:49.740 --> 33:50.340
Got to have a son.

33:50.340 --> 33:50.820
Yeah.

33:50.820 --> 33:52.100
Who's the son of Austin Powers?

33:52.100 --> 33:52.740
He's a teen.

33:52.740 --> 33:53.340
Justin Bieber.

33:53.340 --> 33:53.900
Eddie Redmayne.

33:53.900 --> 33:54.220
No.

33:54.220 --> 33:54.580
No.

33:54.580 --> 33:55.260
No.

33:55.260 --> 33:55.940
Ooh.

33:55.940 --> 33:57.540
Yeah, you jumped on my Eddie Redmayne.

33:57.540 --> 33:58.900
Eddie Redmayne is very good.

33:58.900 --> 34:00.420
OK, we've got to do Time Travel, right?

34:00.420 --> 34:03.500
It's Austin Powers' son from the future, he just had a baby.

34:03.500 --> 34:04.300
We're not Time Traveling.

34:04.300 --> 34:04.540
No.

34:04.540 --> 34:05.100
He's got a son.

34:05.100 --> 34:05.580
He's dealing with a son.

34:05.580 --> 34:07.900
Time Traveled in every one of them, Justin.

34:07.900 --> 34:08.460
Not in this one.

34:08.460 --> 34:10.220
I know, but not this one.

34:10.220 --> 34:12.900
This one's called Austin Powers Back Number Two Basics.

34:12.900 --> 34:14.660
I want to keep it real.

34:14.660 --> 34:15.500
It's Mike Myers Day.

34:15.500 --> 34:18.460
He's a 70-year-old man, and he had a son.

34:18.460 --> 34:19.780
And maybe he's a grandpa.

34:19.780 --> 34:20.700
Maybe his son's about to have a son.

34:20.700 --> 34:21.860
Michael Caine is back in it.

34:21.860 --> 34:22.540
Michael Caine's back in it.

34:22.540 --> 34:23.780
Michael Caine's dead as disco.

34:23.780 --> 34:25.500
There's no way in this world Austin Powers.

34:25.500 --> 34:26.540
Wait, hold on.

34:26.540 --> 34:27.740
Don't just spring that on me.

34:27.740 --> 34:29.700
Michael Caine's not actually dead, right?

34:29.700 --> 34:31.460
What Justin is saying is Michael Caine is alive now,

34:31.460 --> 34:33.740
but there's no way he outlives the next Austin Powers.

34:33.740 --> 34:35.180
Austin Powers is 70.

34:35.180 --> 34:37.220
Then we Jedi ghost him in it.

34:37.220 --> 34:39.420
We definitely need a Michael Caine Jedi ghost scene.

34:39.420 --> 34:39.700
Now.

34:39.700 --> 34:41.060
Record it today.

34:41.060 --> 34:43.660
Right now, there's a movie executive at,

34:43.660 --> 34:45.420
who owns these rights?

34:45.420 --> 34:45.940
Paramount.

34:45.940 --> 34:46.460
Paramount.

34:46.460 --> 34:47.820
There's a movie executive at Paramount,

34:47.820 --> 34:50.300
hearing this right now, and saying to himself,

34:50.300 --> 34:51.500
oh, this is going to be great.

34:51.500 --> 34:52.580
What we're going to do?

34:52.580 --> 34:56.340
We're going to CGI Mike Myers to make him play his own son.

34:56.340 --> 34:56.840
No.

34:56.840 --> 34:57.340
No.

34:57.340 --> 34:58.060
No, listen to me.

34:58.060 --> 34:58.780
That's wrong.

34:58.780 --> 35:00.020
Don't chase that.

35:00.020 --> 35:00.580
It's real.

35:00.580 --> 35:01.620
It's Eddie Redmayne.

35:01.620 --> 35:04.260
As his son, and he's at school, or-

35:04.260 --> 35:04.980
Is he training?

35:04.980 --> 35:05.740
Maybe he's training.

35:05.740 --> 35:09.540
Maybe he's a DJ, and he's not in the spy life.

35:09.540 --> 35:10.620
But for some reason-

35:10.620 --> 35:11.100
Oh, fuck.

35:11.100 --> 35:13.940
Oh, Austin Powers has been kidnapped.

35:13.940 --> 35:15.740
Austin Powers has been ki- OK.

35:15.740 --> 35:16.780
Austin Powers.

35:16.780 --> 35:17.540
OK.

35:17.540 --> 35:21.180
Dr. Evil set a trap 30 years ago for Austin Powers,

35:21.180 --> 35:23.220
and it's a trap just for Austin Powers.

35:23.220 --> 35:26.380
And the thing is, they stole Felicity Shagwell,

35:26.380 --> 35:29.020
and locked her in a trap that only Austin can access.

35:29.020 --> 35:32.020
Except, Austin's been captured by another villain that's

35:32.020 --> 35:35.180
competing with Dr. Evil, OK?

35:35.180 --> 35:37.660
Austin Powers Jr. has enough of- they

35:37.660 --> 35:40.900
theorize- the Basel Exposition theorizes

35:40.900 --> 35:46.900
that Austin Powers Jr. will have enough of Austin's DNA,

35:46.900 --> 35:50.620
or genetic material, to break into the facility

35:50.620 --> 35:53.300
that only Austin could access, because it's DNA,

35:53.300 --> 35:54.740
to rescue Felicity Shagwell.

35:54.740 --> 35:58.220
And the two of them will rescue Austin Powers together.

35:58.220 --> 36:01.460
And she's got to like, you know, your dad's not as bad as.

36:01.460 --> 36:02.260
Yeah.

36:02.260 --> 36:03.980
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

36:03.980 --> 36:05.140
Here's what I like about this.

36:05.140 --> 36:06.020
No humor.

36:06.020 --> 36:06.820
No jokes.

36:06.820 --> 36:07.620
No jokes.

36:07.620 --> 36:08.420
No jokes.

36:08.420 --> 36:10.020
This is a very dark, gritty reboot.

36:10.020 --> 36:10.740
The competing-

36:10.740 --> 36:11.740
No, it's not dark and gritty, guys.

36:11.740 --> 36:12.700
I want to get this made.

36:12.700 --> 36:15.220
I'm tired of us pitching a bunch of fart ideas

36:15.220 --> 36:16.180
that don't get made.

36:16.180 --> 36:17.740
And we always get gritty reboots.

36:17.740 --> 36:18.420
Gritty this, gritty this.

36:18.420 --> 36:19.500
I want to make Austin Powers 4.

36:19.500 --> 36:20.420
It's not a gritty reboot.

36:20.420 --> 36:22.500
It's just like a really in-depth, like, deep dive

36:22.500 --> 36:23.860
into, like, family and stuff like that.

36:23.860 --> 36:25.660
And let me take it one step further.

36:25.660 --> 36:28.540
The competing villain, that's Scott Evil.

36:28.540 --> 36:31.140
This Scott Evil is now turning like he's got his whole-

36:31.140 --> 36:34.180
Austin Powers colon generations.

36:34.180 --> 36:34.980
Yeah.

36:34.980 --> 36:35.780
Yeah.

36:35.780 --> 36:36.980
This is so good.

36:36.980 --> 36:38.420
Like father, like son.

36:38.420 --> 36:42.180
You'll never guess who helps Felicity and Austin Powers

36:42.180 --> 36:45.100
Jr. rescue Austin from Scott Evil.

36:45.100 --> 36:46.340
You'll never guess who helps.

36:46.340 --> 36:47.140
Is it Dr. Evil?

36:47.140 --> 36:48.180
It's Dr. Evil, Travis.

36:48.180 --> 36:48.980
Dr. Evil.

36:48.980 --> 36:52.180
That's who helps to get back on top.

36:52.180 --> 36:53.180
This is really good.

36:53.180 --> 36:57.740
Austin Powers colon sins of the father.

36:57.740 --> 36:58.620
This is good.

36:58.620 --> 37:01.740
Eddie Raimond is such a fucking good poll for Austin Powers.

37:01.740 --> 37:03.460
I wish it wasn't a British person.

37:03.460 --> 37:04.980
But I think that Eddie's probably-

37:04.980 --> 37:05.780
Well, I mean-

37:05.780 --> 37:07.460
I would also like to find an opportunity.

37:07.460 --> 37:09.900
Ooh, maybe number two's had a son.

37:09.900 --> 37:12.500
And it's number three, number four, number eight.

37:12.500 --> 37:13.780
And just like that, we've lost it.

37:13.780 --> 37:14.660
Played by Shia LaBeouf.

37:14.660 --> 37:15.460
Just like that.

37:15.460 --> 37:15.980
Oh, OK.

37:15.980 --> 37:16.780
We're back.

37:16.780 --> 37:17.580
Yep.

37:17.580 --> 37:18.780
I thought I'd get you in there.

37:18.780 --> 37:21.340
Shia LaBeouf movie son.

37:21.340 --> 37:24.100
I have the perfect person to play Austin.

37:24.100 --> 37:25.300
Now, Eddie Redmayne is not bad.

37:25.300 --> 37:26.100
To play Austin?

37:26.100 --> 37:27.380
I think I have a pretty good idea.

37:27.380 --> 37:29.980
Yeah, I think America knows the favorite person.

37:29.980 --> 37:32.260
You're fairly confident you can get Mike?

37:32.260 --> 37:33.060
Yes.

37:33.060 --> 37:33.860
Yeah, I think so.

37:33.860 --> 37:35.060
You think you can get Mike?

37:35.060 --> 37:38.980
I feel like if you could get Mike, he would have been-

37:38.980 --> 37:40.460
we would have had this film already, right?

37:40.460 --> 37:43.340
Mike Myers has a second cell phone like a drug dealer

37:43.340 --> 37:46.180
because he does not want to be on his real phone making

37:46.180 --> 37:48.220
a call and missed the one from Paramount

37:48.220 --> 37:49.620
asking him to be Mike Myers.

37:49.620 --> 37:53.420
Can I hit you guys with this for Austin Powers Jr.?

37:53.420 --> 37:54.220
Uh-huh.

37:54.220 --> 37:55.580
Adam Devine from Workaholics.

37:55.580 --> 37:56.380
Oh, my god.

37:56.380 --> 37:57.180
OK.

37:57.180 --> 37:57.980
Think about it.

37:57.980 --> 38:00.020
That's really, really, really, really it.

38:00.020 --> 38:00.820
That's it.

38:00.820 --> 38:01.620
That's it.

38:01.620 --> 38:02.420
Perfect.

38:02.420 --> 38:03.220
Justin, let me edit this.

38:03.220 --> 38:04.660
First off, the guy's fucking hysterical.

38:04.660 --> 38:06.420
He makes you laugh all the time.

38:06.420 --> 38:08.660
So we don't need to write jokes in our movie.

38:08.660 --> 38:09.940
You'll just be funny.

38:09.940 --> 38:11.540
Can I throw a little bit of spaghetti at the wall?

38:11.540 --> 38:12.660
A little bit of comedy spaghetti.

38:12.660 --> 38:13.660
You guys tell me what you think.

38:13.660 --> 38:14.460
Yeah.

38:14.460 --> 38:17.700
We do a small crossover scene with the master of disguise

38:17.700 --> 38:18.900
as played by Dana Carp.

38:18.900 --> 38:19.700
OK.

38:19.700 --> 38:21.100
So you're getting a little deep into that.

38:21.100 --> 38:24.260
Because I want, I think if there's a scene,

38:24.260 --> 38:25.220
OK, maybe this is it.

38:25.220 --> 38:28.060
Because I just want a tiny, tiny scene of like Austin

38:28.060 --> 38:29.940
in the prison where he's been captured

38:29.940 --> 38:32.420
and the guy in the cell next to him is Dana Carvey.

38:32.420 --> 38:34.100
But something for the fans.

38:34.100 --> 38:36.540
Something where it's like, oh, they're back together.

38:36.540 --> 38:37.340
We're not worthy.

38:37.340 --> 38:38.500
Yeah, we're not worthy.

38:38.500 --> 38:40.060
I love that.

38:40.060 --> 38:42.100
Oh, and maybe there's a thing where someone says literally,

38:42.100 --> 38:42.900
we're not worthy.

38:42.900 --> 38:43.700
He's a big fan.

38:43.700 --> 38:47.940
Can I suggest one other name for Austin Powers?

38:47.940 --> 38:52.420
What about Kristen Schaal as Austin Powers, Jr.?

38:52.420 --> 38:55.940
Austin is, could go either way as a name.

38:55.940 --> 38:56.740
He had a daughter.

38:56.740 --> 38:58.180
She's not in the life.

38:58.180 --> 38:59.820
But now she is.

38:59.820 --> 39:02.540
Austin Powers, Jr. is Kristen Schaal.

39:02.540 --> 39:03.500
I'm just saying that's another option.

39:03.500 --> 39:04.860
That would be fucking really good, too.

39:04.860 --> 39:06.940
I would also like to have Kate McKinnon in there somewhere,

39:06.940 --> 39:08.820
just because I've been trying to find a project to work with

39:08.820 --> 39:09.140
her on.

39:09.140 --> 39:10.740
Yeah, I'd love to work with her.

39:10.740 --> 39:13.420
You know she's going to be Miss Frizzle in the new.

39:13.420 --> 39:14.220
I do know that.

39:14.220 --> 39:15.020
What?

39:15.020 --> 39:15.820
I do know that.

39:15.820 --> 39:16.620
OK.

39:16.620 --> 39:18.020
Were we recording a podcast?

39:18.020 --> 39:19.220
Yeah, I think that's about enough.

39:19.220 --> 39:20.220
I forgot what we were doing.

39:20.220 --> 39:24.820
So anyway, in closing, give us some money to do this.

39:24.820 --> 39:26.220
I think we were doing a question, weren't we?

39:26.220 --> 39:27.020
Yeah.

39:27.020 --> 39:28.220
How could it be that guy?

39:28.220 --> 39:29.020
No, we got it.

39:29.020 --> 39:29.820
We did it.

39:29.820 --> 39:30.620
OK.

39:30.620 --> 39:31.620
That's how you beat that guy.

39:31.620 --> 39:33.420
You're the guy who got Austin Powers, Jr. made.

39:33.420 --> 39:34.820
Austin Powers, Jr. off the ground.

39:34.820 --> 39:36.020
Why don't you read another one?

39:36.020 --> 39:37.020
OK.

39:37.020 --> 39:38.520
I'm also finally doing Austin Powers,

39:38.520 --> 39:41.720
4 instead of like an HBO series, rather than just doing,

39:41.720 --> 39:43.820
I think there's too much to be told in one movie.

39:43.820 --> 39:45.020
I think we can make it a series.

39:45.020 --> 39:45.820
I'm just saying.

39:45.820 --> 39:47.220
It would be nice if it was a series,

39:47.220 --> 39:52.820
because then otherwise my three-pack Blu-ray collector's

39:52.820 --> 39:56.420
Criterion edition of Austin Powers would,

39:56.420 --> 40:00.220
like it won't feel so shameful if it's a TV series next to that.

40:00.220 --> 40:02.620
If this is a fourth movie, what, am I going to buy a new box?

40:02.620 --> 40:03.620
It just doesn't make sense.

40:03.620 --> 40:04.620
You get duct taped on.

40:04.620 --> 40:07.820
I was doing some chores with my girlfriend at her apartment

40:07.820 --> 40:10.520
the other day and noticed something peculiar.

40:10.520 --> 40:12.820
While she was washing dishes, she

40:12.820 --> 40:15.420
would scrub them with a sponge, shake them off,

40:15.420 --> 40:17.520
and set them out to dry.

40:17.520 --> 40:20.320
Wait, what?

40:20.320 --> 40:22.320
She would scrub them with a sponge.

40:22.320 --> 40:23.020
Yes.

40:23.020 --> 40:24.420
Shake them off.

40:24.420 --> 40:25.020
Yeah.

40:25.020 --> 40:28.520
And then set them out to dry.

40:28.520 --> 40:31.920
She does not rinse her dishes.

40:31.920 --> 40:33.920
I love this woman more than anything,

40:33.920 --> 40:36.220
and I don't know how to lovingly say that she

40:36.220 --> 40:38.820
isn't finishing her dish job.

40:38.820 --> 40:42.120
We plan on moving in together later this year,

40:42.120 --> 40:44.620
and I can't imagine eating off soapy dishes

40:44.620 --> 40:46.420
for the rest of our lives.

40:46.420 --> 40:48.420
Please help.

40:48.420 --> 40:51.020
Well, let me, that's from Sudsy near Seattle.

40:51.020 --> 40:53.320
Let me say this first off.

40:53.320 --> 40:58.520
That's obviously utterly baffling human behavior.

40:58.520 --> 41:01.720
But one thing we should understand going into this

41:01.720 --> 41:03.920
is that, I don't know if this question answer is a man

41:03.920 --> 41:06.920
or a woman or a non-binary person,

41:06.920 --> 41:08.820
it doesn't really matter.

41:08.820 --> 41:11.920
Telling your partner they don't wash the dishes good

41:11.920 --> 41:13.820
is never going to be good optics.

41:13.820 --> 41:15.420
It's just never going to be.

41:15.420 --> 41:19.520
Do you want to wash the dishes by yourself forever?

41:19.520 --> 41:21.720
Because this is a good way.

41:21.720 --> 41:23.120
Oh, shit.

41:23.120 --> 41:24.420
It's a honey pot.

41:24.420 --> 41:27.720
This is a honey pot.

41:27.720 --> 41:30.420
I've been working for the last nine years with my wife

41:30.420 --> 41:34.420
to get her to just not make me fill the dishwasher anymore.

41:34.420 --> 41:35.520
But I'm like, I don't know.

41:35.520 --> 41:37.220
Honey bowls comes with.

41:37.220 --> 41:37.820
I can't even.

41:37.820 --> 41:38.720
She's like, just do it better.

41:38.720 --> 41:39.720
I'm like, damn it.

41:39.720 --> 41:40.620
I'll get you next time.

41:40.620 --> 41:41.220
I'll treat you.

41:41.220 --> 41:43.420
I'll get you next time, Gadget.

41:43.420 --> 41:47.020
My wife still doesn't do it right.

41:47.020 --> 41:48.920
And there's a right way to do it.

41:48.920 --> 41:51.620
Oh, I don't do it right.

41:51.620 --> 41:55.120
Theresa can fit every dish and cup and plate

41:55.120 --> 41:57.920
and everything we own in one load of dishwasher.

41:57.920 --> 42:01.120
And I put four bowls in, and somehow it's overcrowded.

42:01.120 --> 42:03.920
We got this fucking Martha Stewart square dishware.

42:03.920 --> 42:06.720
And it's just like, it's interlocking.

42:06.720 --> 42:09.520
It's like fucking tetrominoes and that shit.

42:09.520 --> 42:13.320
This, she's like actually making it worse in a way.

42:13.320 --> 42:15.820
Because the food particles, the food particulate,

42:15.820 --> 42:17.620
if you will, is still there.

42:17.620 --> 42:19.020
It's still present.

42:19.020 --> 42:21.620
And now there's soap in the mix.

42:21.620 --> 42:24.420
But you guys are missing the worst element of this.

42:24.420 --> 42:26.420
Your nasty ass sponge.

42:26.420 --> 42:28.320
The sponge is fucking gross.

42:28.320 --> 42:29.820
What's wrong with your sponge?

42:29.820 --> 42:32.620
Well, it touches every bit of everything on the plate, right?

42:32.620 --> 42:36.820
And then sits still wet, still with shit in it,

42:36.820 --> 42:38.920
just like out in the open air.

42:38.920 --> 42:42.320
And then you scrub it again, unless every time,

42:42.320 --> 42:44.020
unless you do have a dishwasher,

42:44.020 --> 42:46.420
but you only use it to wash your sponge

42:46.420 --> 42:48.020
between washing dishes.

42:48.020 --> 42:48.620
The nightmare.

42:48.620 --> 42:50.320
You have to buy a new sponge every time.

42:50.320 --> 42:52.920
You need one.

42:52.920 --> 42:57.720
Now, I don't, this is funny that we're talking about this.

42:57.720 --> 43:00.320
Speaking of like different dish procedure,

43:00.320 --> 43:01.920
I tend to hand wash dishes more.

43:01.920 --> 43:02.620
We have a dishwasher.

43:02.620 --> 43:03.920
I tend to hand wash dishes usually

43:03.920 --> 43:06.720
because it's like, now I don't have to worry about it.

43:06.720 --> 43:10.220
I just wash it real quick and then put it up.

43:10.220 --> 43:14.320
But I lay it out and I don't ever dry it.

43:14.320 --> 43:16.820
And I mentioned this to,

43:16.820 --> 43:19.020
I went and got my hair cut by my man, Sonny,

43:19.020 --> 43:22.020
my dude at MasterCuts, who I've discussed before.

43:22.020 --> 43:24.120
And he said, oh, I told him this.

43:24.120 --> 43:25.320
We were discussing dishes for some reason.

43:25.320 --> 43:25.720
I told him this.

43:25.720 --> 43:29.220
He said, oh, buddy, nobody dries their dishes.

43:29.220 --> 43:30.420
It's on TV.

43:30.420 --> 43:32.420
If you're on TV, you dry your dishes.

43:32.420 --> 43:33.620
Nobody dries their dishes, buddy.

43:33.620 --> 43:34.620
Who's got time for that?

43:34.620 --> 43:37.420
I think we all realize that like, the sun dries it

43:37.420 --> 43:39.320
or whatever, if you just like put it somewhere from now.

43:39.320 --> 43:41.020
But when he said that about like,

43:41.020 --> 43:42.320
it's something they do on TV.

43:42.320 --> 43:42.620
Yeah.

43:42.620 --> 43:46.320
I started thinking like, no, wait a minute.

43:46.320 --> 43:48.620
If you watch Dawson's Creek anytime,

43:48.620 --> 43:50.120
or, and sometimes the OC,

43:50.120 --> 43:51.620
but anytime in Dawson's Creek the OC.

43:51.620 --> 43:54.120
Nobody does any chores on the OC ever.

43:54.120 --> 43:57.120
Anytime the mother character on either of the shows

43:57.120 --> 44:00.120
is having a conversation, she is chopping vegetables,

44:00.120 --> 44:02.620
like constantly chopping vegetables.

44:02.620 --> 44:04.820
And maybe drying dishes is like that.

44:04.820 --> 44:06.720
It's like, it's weird to just stand in the kitchen

44:06.720 --> 44:08.620
and have a conversation to like,

44:08.620 --> 44:10.920
we're inventing this idea of drying your dishes.

44:10.920 --> 44:13.620
So like, there's some movement in the blocking,

44:13.620 --> 44:16.820
but it's just a media creation of drying dishes.

44:16.820 --> 44:19.420
Because we all know if we're sitting and looking at each other,

44:19.420 --> 44:20.920
dead in the eye, in the dead of night,

44:20.920 --> 44:22.320
we look at each other, wake up out of dead sleep,

44:22.320 --> 44:23.520
we look at the other person and say,

44:23.520 --> 44:24.620
they dry on their own, don't they?

44:24.620 --> 44:25.120
They do.

44:25.120 --> 44:25.520
Yeah.

44:25.520 --> 44:26.520
They do. It's called evaporation.

44:26.520 --> 44:28.020
Time dries all plates.

44:28.020 --> 44:29.220
As, as-

44:29.220 --> 44:31.320
You guys dry, are you guys drying dishes out there?

44:31.320 --> 44:31.620
No.

44:31.620 --> 44:34.020
The only thing I dry, I do dry one thing.

44:34.020 --> 44:35.220
It's pots and pans.

44:35.220 --> 44:36.820
I'll dry pots because they're metal.

44:36.820 --> 44:40.220
And like, and I've seen like, sheet pans go rusty

44:40.220 --> 44:42.620
from like, a little bit of moisture caught in like,

44:42.620 --> 44:44.020
a fold of something, you know, and like-

44:44.020 --> 44:46.420
See, I got that space age material, dude.

44:46.420 --> 44:49.820
I got that fucking hydrophobic alloy.

44:49.820 --> 44:50.920
So I'm not worried about that.

44:50.920 --> 44:53.620
Also, the problem with pots and pans is they're so big and clunky

44:53.620 --> 44:56.920
that like, it's hard to find a good place to just stack.

44:56.920 --> 44:58.220
Anyways, we're getting off topic here.

44:58.220 --> 45:00.320
How can we help this person?

45:00.320 --> 45:02.120
What should they do? They can't say anything, right?

45:02.120 --> 45:03.220
They just have to rinse?

45:03.220 --> 45:05.420
You gotta rewash at like, at 3 a.m. wake up

45:05.420 --> 45:07.920
and like, do the fucking like, cobbler's elf shit.

45:07.920 --> 45:09.720
You could do a thing.

45:09.720 --> 45:11.220
Okay, you could do this move.

45:11.220 --> 45:13.920
Honey, I just read the darndest thing.

45:13.920 --> 45:17.120
Do you know that there are people that rinse their dishes,

45:17.120 --> 45:18.520
you know, after they scrub them?

45:18.520 --> 45:22.620
I read in Popular Scientific American that-

45:22.620 --> 45:24.020
Wash things that's never happened.

45:24.020 --> 45:26.220
That's just Neil deGrasse Tyson is what you just described.

45:26.220 --> 45:28.220
Rinses.

45:28.220 --> 45:30.520
That rinsing your dishes is actually,

45:30.520 --> 45:31.920
like, I don't like to rinse them either,

45:31.920 --> 45:33.520
but apparently it's actually better.

45:33.520 --> 45:36.520
It makes you smarter like Mozart.

45:36.520 --> 45:38.320
You know Mozart rinses dishes?

45:38.320 --> 45:39.220
You know, yeah.

45:39.220 --> 45:41.320
Pretty weird.

45:41.320 --> 45:42.120
Can I read a Yahoo?

45:42.120 --> 45:42.720
Yeah, please.

45:42.720 --> 45:44.420
Or should we talk more about the Maximum Fun Drive?

45:44.420 --> 45:45.820
No, read another Yahoo.

45:45.820 --> 45:48.820
This Yahoo was sent in by Rachel Rose in Game Recognized Game.

45:48.820 --> 45:50.220
Thank you, Rachel.

45:50.220 --> 45:53.020
Yahoo answers user, well, this one's just anonymous,

45:53.020 --> 45:57.720
so I'm gonna call him, Reince, asks,

45:57.720 --> 46:02.020
do celebrities have to go to school?

46:02.020 --> 46:03.320
Do celebrities have to go to school?

46:03.320 --> 46:05.520
Well, no, I know they bring in like the fucking Olsen twins.

46:05.520 --> 46:07.020
They're like, we'll bring school to you,

46:07.020 --> 46:09.220
and they bring in a tutor or whatever.

46:09.220 --> 46:13.320
I have a friend who is in Billboard Dad with the Olsen twins

46:13.320 --> 46:16.520
and said that they had to like share like a tutor for a day,

46:16.520 --> 46:18.520
and it's like, I bet that's not,

46:18.520 --> 46:20.520
okay, I want to be very careful with my language here

46:20.520 --> 46:23.020
because I'm not saying celebrities are dumb

46:23.020 --> 46:24.020
or anything like that.

46:24.020 --> 46:28.520
Obviously, Mayim Bialik is like a super genius,

46:28.520 --> 46:32.020
but I have to think the school they bring to you

46:32.020 --> 46:35.220
on the set of Billboard Dad isn't very good.

46:35.220 --> 46:36.420
Well, here's the thing, Griffin.

46:36.420 --> 46:39.820
Counterpoint, counterpoint, why would it need to be?

46:39.820 --> 46:40.920
What do you go to school for?

46:40.920 --> 46:42.120
What do you go to college for?

46:42.120 --> 46:43.120
To get a job on Billboard Dad.

46:43.120 --> 46:44.420
To get a job, to get a career.

46:44.420 --> 46:46.220
Yeah. Yeah.

46:46.220 --> 46:49.320
Listen, if you've made it to starring in Billboard Dad,

46:49.320 --> 46:51.020
what career are you worried about getting?

46:51.020 --> 46:53.620
If you think about it, a lot of people will say like,

46:53.620 --> 46:55.620
if you're gonna try to be in entertainment,

46:55.620 --> 46:59.120
don't have a plan B because it's so hard

46:59.120 --> 47:01.420
to make it in entertainment that if you have a plan B,

47:01.420 --> 47:02.620
that's what you're gonna fall back on.

47:02.620 --> 47:04.220
So maybe if you're already in Billboard Dad,

47:04.220 --> 47:07.520
like learning how to think is admitting weakness.

47:07.520 --> 47:10.820
If you learn how to think and what like science is

47:10.820 --> 47:13.220
and numbers and stuff, you're saying to yourself,

47:13.220 --> 47:15.720
I might not always be riding this gravy train.

47:15.720 --> 47:18.320
So maybe you shouldn't, maybe it's like,

47:18.320 --> 47:19.520
you're setting yourself up for failure

47:19.520 --> 47:20.360
in the entertainment industry.

47:20.360 --> 47:21.420
And I like that in your world, Justin,

47:21.420 --> 47:23.420
the person who's worried about not always riding

47:23.420 --> 47:25.420
this gravy train is the child actor

47:25.420 --> 47:27.220
and not who's ever in control of stuff.

47:27.220 --> 47:29.420
It's just like, I don't want them to learn about reading.

47:29.420 --> 47:32.820
Like the image I keep coming back to is

47:32.820 --> 47:35.220
you're on the set of Billboard Dad and the tutor comes

47:35.220 --> 47:37.420
and goes to the Olsen twins and says,

47:37.420 --> 47:39.720
what is this shape with the six sides of it?

47:39.720 --> 47:44.720
And Mary Kate says, well, that there is a rhombus.

47:45.020 --> 47:48.220
And the teacher says, no, it's not a rhombus, try again.

47:48.220 --> 47:52.520
And Mary Kate says, I'm Michelle fucking Tanner.

47:52.520 --> 47:54.520
It's a rhombus.

47:54.520 --> 47:57.020
It is a rhombus.

47:57.020 --> 48:00.120
Do you think, okay, look at the basic point though.

48:00.120 --> 48:03.020
Do you think that in the day-to-day life

48:03.020 --> 48:05.620
of the Olsen twins, if one of them misidentified

48:05.620 --> 48:08.420
a basic shape, anybody's gonna fucking correct them?

48:08.420 --> 48:09.420
Yeah. How rude.

48:09.420 --> 48:10.220
No way.

48:12.120 --> 48:13.520
On the set of Home Alone 2,

48:13.520 --> 48:14.920
nobody's gonna go to Macaulay Culkin and be like,

48:14.920 --> 48:17.220
what's 60 times four?

48:17.220 --> 48:19.120
And he's like- It's 240.

48:19.120 --> 48:21.020
Yeah, okay. I know it.

48:21.020 --> 48:22.620
Mr. Math Blaster over there.

48:24.420 --> 48:25.720
But the question is this, like-

48:25.720 --> 48:27.520
I think he asked that and Macaulay Culkin

48:27.520 --> 48:30.220
just throws a wad of $100 bills into his fucking open-

48:30.220 --> 48:31.820
What's 60 times four?

48:31.820 --> 48:33.820
He threw a wad of $100 bills into my mouth.

48:33.820 --> 48:35.220
What the fuck?

48:35.220 --> 48:36.720
Like if you're Elijah Wood, right?

48:36.720 --> 48:39.020
And you're filming North and someone's like,

48:39.020 --> 48:41.320
hey, tell me about this like battle from Civil War.

48:41.320 --> 48:43.520
You're like, no, I'm starring in North.

48:43.520 --> 48:46.220
Bye. Bye, I'm in North.

48:46.220 --> 48:47.920
Bye, Macaulay.

48:47.920 --> 48:49.320
Hey Macaulay, I'd like to,

48:49.320 --> 48:50.720
you did the required reading, right?

48:50.720 --> 48:52.420
You read 1984 and he's just like,

48:52.420 --> 48:54.220
I'm playing Sonic the Hedgehog,

48:54.220 --> 48:56.420
Sonic and Knuckles with Michael Jackson right now.

48:56.420 --> 48:58.620
We're eating Pizza Hut and playing Sonic.

48:58.620 --> 49:00.820
Can you please fucking get out of my hand?

49:00.820 --> 49:03.120
I gotta go dangle Elijah Wood out of a tree house.

49:03.120 --> 49:06.620
That was a documentary, that movie.

49:06.620 --> 49:09.120
You do, like, you could make the argument

49:09.120 --> 49:10.820
that if you are famous,

49:10.820 --> 49:12.720
and that's at last, right?

49:12.720 --> 49:14.320
Like there's so few people for whom

49:14.320 --> 49:16.420
they can consistently keep that up their whole lives, right?

49:16.420 --> 49:17.920
So you can make the argument that if they make you

49:17.920 --> 49:20.020
go to school when you're famous as a child,

49:20.020 --> 49:21.520
you're like missing dope shit

49:21.520 --> 49:22.920
you could be doing everywhere.

49:22.920 --> 49:24.720
You could be like going to parties.

49:24.720 --> 49:26.020
I'm not saying, I don't want to be,

49:26.020 --> 49:29.120
I know celebrity, I know education's important.

49:29.120 --> 49:31.220
I know that these people work hard to teach these kids.

49:31.220 --> 49:33.220
I'm just saying, I don't know how you teach

49:33.220 --> 49:36.120
what is essentially a god.

49:36.120 --> 49:37.120
That's the thing is I'm not saying

49:37.120 --> 49:38.120
all celebrities are dumb.

49:38.120 --> 49:40.020
I'm saying if I were a child celebrity,

49:40.020 --> 49:41.720
you couldn't get me to read.

49:41.720 --> 49:42.820
You could not get me to learn.

49:42.820 --> 49:45.720
I would hire eight people to read scripts to me.

49:45.720 --> 49:48.420
Well, okay, but like normal kids

49:48.420 --> 49:50.320
don't have to learn about like

49:50.320 --> 49:52.320
how to retain as many points as possible

49:52.320 --> 49:54.820
on the back end of the international distribution rights,

49:54.820 --> 49:56.320
which like the old students have to,

49:56.320 --> 49:58.320
it's just a different, it's a different education,

49:58.320 --> 49:59.220
it's a different intelligence.

49:59.220 --> 50:00.520
They're getting the street smarts.

50:00.520 --> 50:04.120
They get, but like if the street is

50:04.120 --> 50:06.620
Hollywood Boulevard smarts.

50:06.620 --> 50:09.120
I bet you Mara Wilson paid a lot of attention

50:09.120 --> 50:11.820
and like really liked learning from her teachers.

50:11.820 --> 50:13.620
Well, Mara Wilson is in fact a genius.

50:13.620 --> 50:14.520
Yeah, I know, I know.

50:14.520 --> 50:16.120
If I was a genius, I could probably be

50:16.120 --> 50:17.720
like a child actor and smart too.

50:17.720 --> 50:19.020
Yeah, I don't want to paint with too broad a brush

50:19.020 --> 50:19.820
is what I'm saying.

50:19.820 --> 50:20.820
But I'm saying back in time, okay,

50:20.820 --> 50:23.120
let's travel back to the 1700s, right?

50:23.120 --> 50:25.320
You were apprenticed to a printmaker.

50:25.320 --> 50:26.720
There weren't people there like, okay,

50:26.720 --> 50:29.420
but also we need you to learn about baking and shit.

50:29.420 --> 50:30.120
That's what I'm saying.

50:30.120 --> 50:32.120
You had the one job and you were happy with it.

50:32.120 --> 50:34.420
If you're a child star, you have apprenticed.

50:34.420 --> 50:36.620
You have your job, your career path is set.

50:36.620 --> 50:40.320
It's like romance education is a modern contrivance.

50:40.320 --> 50:41.720
Like you don't need to know all this stuff.

50:41.720 --> 50:43.820
We're breaking down some shit on this episode.

50:43.820 --> 50:46.820
Why can't we go back to a day where if someone's like,

50:46.820 --> 50:47.820
can you balance your checkbook?

50:47.820 --> 50:50.120
And you're like, no, I was in Star Trek.

50:50.120 --> 50:53.520
Like, yeah, obviously my job is being in Star Trek.

50:53.520 --> 50:55.220
Your job is to balance my checkbook.

50:55.220 --> 50:56.020
Everybody wins.

50:56.020 --> 50:57.520
I'm a job creator.

50:57.520 --> 50:59.320
That's the problem with the economy now.

50:59.320 --> 51:03.020
Too many people getting into other, like I do my own taxes.

51:03.020 --> 51:04.520
No, you shouldn't do your,

51:04.520 --> 51:06.120
you should pay someone else to do your taxes

51:06.120 --> 51:07.520
because that's their job.

51:07.520 --> 51:08.920
They also need money.

51:08.920 --> 51:10.520
Why are you taking money away from people

51:10.520 --> 51:12.020
who know how to do your taxes?

51:12.020 --> 51:14.520
Yeah, learning too much is just hurting the economy.

51:14.520 --> 51:16.220
This is true.

51:16.220 --> 51:17.220
We're saying some stuff.

51:17.220 --> 51:18.220
We're getting there.

51:18.220 --> 51:20.220
We're saying some stuff on this one.

51:20.220 --> 51:22.520
You know another way of getting close to the truth

51:22.520 --> 51:25.820
and that's to donate to the Maximum Fun Drive.

51:25.820 --> 51:27.720
The Maximum Fun Drive is going on right now.

51:27.720 --> 51:29.620
If you go to MaximumFun.org,

51:29.620 --> 51:32.420
click that donate button and just help us out for five,

51:32.420 --> 51:34.120
just five bucks a month.

51:34.120 --> 51:38.520
You're going to get oodles upon oodles of noodles.

51:38.520 --> 51:42.820
You're going to get noodles delivered directly to you.

51:42.820 --> 51:43.620
Still hot.

51:43.620 --> 51:44.620
How do they do it?

51:44.620 --> 51:49.520
At a $10, oh, we didn't touch on this one, 35 bucks.

51:49.520 --> 51:50.020
Yes.

51:50.020 --> 51:51.020
You can spare 35 bucks.

51:51.020 --> 51:52.120
I know that's a chunk of change,

51:52.120 --> 51:53.220
but maybe you can spare.

51:53.220 --> 51:55.920
Maybe you listen to like a lot of shows.

51:55.920 --> 51:59.520
We hear from people a lot where they were listening to two shows

51:59.520 --> 52:00.820
and then within the last year,

52:00.820 --> 52:04.020
they picked up Still Buffering and Rose Buddies and Schmanders

52:04.020 --> 52:05.720
and they think I'm going to listen to a lot more shows.

52:05.720 --> 52:07.220
I should up my donation.

52:07.220 --> 52:10.120
If you can get to 35 bucks a month,

52:10.120 --> 52:12.520
you're going to get the stuff we already talked about,

52:12.520 --> 52:16.220
the bonus content, the enamel pin, the keep in touch kit.

52:16.220 --> 52:20.920
You're also going to need a pair of rocket engraved beer mugs,

52:20.920 --> 52:24.720
which that's going to make your frosty bruise go down real nice.

52:24.720 --> 52:25.020
Yeah.

52:25.020 --> 52:25.620
If you can say-

52:25.620 --> 52:27.920
Time to blast off to adventure in drinking.

52:27.920 --> 52:29.220
You can put anything there.

52:29.220 --> 52:30.920
You don't got to be alcoholic.

52:30.920 --> 52:33.620
You could have a root beer float in those mugs.

52:33.620 --> 52:34.120
Yeah.

52:34.120 --> 52:35.420
Or treat yourself.

52:35.420 --> 52:38.320
This is the way, these drives are the way that like,

52:38.320 --> 52:40.220
like we don't like asking for money,

52:40.220 --> 52:41.820
but we do like the idea.

52:41.820 --> 52:42.520
Well, Travis does.

52:42.520 --> 52:42.820
I do.

52:42.820 --> 52:45.220
I wasn't going to say it, but I love asking for money.

52:45.220 --> 52:48.120
We don't, we don't, broadly speaking, like asking for money,

52:48.120 --> 52:51.220
but we do, the thing that I really like,

52:51.220 --> 52:54.020
the reason I don't feel bad about the Max Fund Drive is that

52:54.020 --> 52:59.020
I really do believe it's worth paying for the stuff that you like.

52:59.020 --> 53:04.120
And we are in the way that media has sort of diversified.

53:04.120 --> 53:07.220
You can find stuff that's much more niche than you used to be able to,

53:07.220 --> 53:11.120
but you have to, you have to be the one to support that stuff

53:11.120 --> 53:13.520
and you have to be the one who says I like this.

53:13.520 --> 53:16.620
I want more of it because there isn't that broad,

53:16.620 --> 53:19.320
you know, media buy, you know,

53:19.320 --> 53:23.120
like Gillette isn't buying a bunch of ads to keep their shows running.

53:23.120 --> 53:26.420
Like we rely on the people who like the stuff to pay for it.

53:26.420 --> 53:28.920
And I, we really do, it really does mean a lot.

53:28.920 --> 53:32.320
When it comes down to it, we don't miss episodes.

53:32.320 --> 53:34.920
Like we work as hard as we can to not miss episodes

53:34.920 --> 53:36.820
because we know that there are people out there supporting us

53:36.820 --> 53:41.020
who, who love the things that we made and look forward to it every week.

53:41.020 --> 53:44.320
And they're supporting us and like, it means a lot to us.

53:44.320 --> 53:47.520
And so like, it's, it's a job for us.

53:47.520 --> 53:49.220
It's also a passion for us.

53:49.220 --> 53:50.020
We work really hard.

53:50.020 --> 53:52.820
Well, I, I think I only really work really hard on Adventure Zone,

53:52.820 --> 53:55.120
but the other ones I do work some on.

53:55.120 --> 53:58.020
Well, we work hard to write the scripts for my brother, my brother and me.

53:58.020 --> 53:58.820
Yeah, sure.

53:58.820 --> 54:00.720
That's hours and hours every day.

54:00.720 --> 54:01.820
And to pay the writers.

54:01.820 --> 54:02.120
Yeah.

54:02.120 --> 54:02.820
And to pay the writers.

54:02.820 --> 54:03.920
To pay for certain ain't cheap.

54:03.920 --> 54:04.320
Yeah.

54:04.320 --> 54:06.720
And so I think what's, I think what's important,

54:06.720 --> 54:10.020
I think what's really, sorry, I'm going to take this one again.

54:10.020 --> 54:11.120
This is like, this is confusing.

54:11.120 --> 54:15.320
Hey, Jerry, what were you thinking with this fucking line, dude?

54:15.320 --> 54:18.220
Like, how am I, like Jerry Seinfeld, like Jerry,

54:18.220 --> 54:21.020
Mr. Jerry Seinfeld, when you wrote this line for our script, like,

54:21.020 --> 54:23.420
what, how did you think I was going to deliver this?

54:23.420 --> 54:24.820
Fucking, just amateur.

54:24.820 --> 54:25.720
You're fired, Jerry.

54:25.720 --> 54:27.820
You're fired, Jerry Seinfeld.

54:27.820 --> 54:31.820
We have more money than you now because of the Maximum Fun family.

54:31.820 --> 54:37.020
We have a, I think part of the reason our show has, has been,

54:37.020 --> 54:40.620
and we as people have been successful is that our listeners know

54:40.620 --> 54:43.620
that we aren't going to speak a bunch of bullshit to them.

54:43.620 --> 54:45.320
That we tell them the truth.

54:45.320 --> 54:46.820
I lied about Jerry Seinfeld.

54:46.820 --> 54:48.220
So here's the truth.

54:48.220 --> 54:51.320
If you listen to our shows and you like it and you don't pay money

54:51.320 --> 54:53.820
and you could pay money, you're stealing it.

54:53.820 --> 54:57.720
And you're a thief and you should go to prison forever.

54:57.720 --> 54:59.020
I don't think that's too much to ask.

54:59.020 --> 55:00.020
I don't think that's too much to ask.

55:00.020 --> 55:02.820
Actually, if you do this and you know you have the money

55:02.820 --> 55:06.320
and you don't give it to us and you could and you want to but don't,

55:06.320 --> 55:09.220
I think just go surrender yourself to a jail right now.

55:09.220 --> 55:12.020
And also listen, we're working on the honor system here,

55:12.020 --> 55:15.820
but it's kind of a reverse honor system where if you have a friend

55:15.820 --> 55:19.320
that you know to donate $5 a month and they listen to our shows

55:19.320 --> 55:22.320
and they don't donate $5, you need to take that friend to jail.

55:22.320 --> 55:23.820
Yeah, you need to send that friend to jail.

55:23.820 --> 55:27.920
If you know in your heart you could ask Ken Jeong to donate $100 a month

55:27.920 --> 55:32.420
to Maximum Fun and you don't do it, you're kind of stealing from us in a way.

55:32.420 --> 55:35.320
Yeah, so both of you should go to, who goes to jail and now?

55:35.320 --> 55:37.820
Both of them go to jail. It's a prisoner's dilemma. Is that it?

55:37.820 --> 55:39.120
That's not how it works at all.

55:39.120 --> 55:41.520
If you don't go to jail, your friend has to go to jail for five years,

55:41.520 --> 55:43.520
but if you both go to jail, it's two and a half years.

55:43.520 --> 55:47.320
Don't actually, don't, hey, everybody, before we get off on a bunch of fun stuff.

55:47.320 --> 55:48.720
Please don't tweet at anybody.

55:48.720 --> 55:49.620
Don't tweet at Ken Jeong.

55:49.620 --> 55:53.020
This is a personal journey between you and your wallet and your jail.

55:53.020 --> 55:56.120
But if you do have a friend who is listening and is stealing it,

55:56.120 --> 55:58.020
you do owe it to rat them out.

55:58.020 --> 55:58.420
Yes.

55:58.420 --> 56:02.220
By which I mean, tell them to donate because we really appreciate you.

56:02.220 --> 56:06.620
Maximumfun.org and then just click donate.

56:06.620 --> 56:10.320
There's a wide range of levels from $5 all the way up to $200.

56:10.320 --> 56:12.320
I don't know what you get at $200.

56:12.320 --> 56:16.420
Oh, you get free registration to Max Fun Con 2018.

56:16.420 --> 56:17.620
So that's like, hey, hell yeah.

56:17.620 --> 56:18.120
Hell yeah.

56:18.120 --> 56:18.720
So that's great.

56:18.720 --> 56:21.620
And for $100, and you also, remember, all of them stack.

56:21.620 --> 56:23.220
So at $200, you get everything before it.

56:23.220 --> 56:27.120
At $100, you're in the Inner Circle Culture Club

56:27.120 --> 56:30.820
where every month you get something sent to you that the hosts

56:30.820 --> 56:33.120
or people that work at Max Fun have chosen for you.

56:33.120 --> 56:36.020
We got called up to do that for February for Rose Buddies.

56:36.020 --> 56:38.620
And we were like, oh, how about this Al Jarreau album

56:38.620 --> 56:39.620
that me and Rachel like?

56:39.620 --> 56:42.320
And then he died like that day.

56:42.320 --> 56:45.820
So I'm just saying we need to be really very careful.

56:45.820 --> 56:46.320
That's great.

56:46.320 --> 56:49.820
Anyway, the Culture Club is really fun, but it's also very cursed.

56:49.820 --> 56:52.220
I actually really like this time of year

56:52.220 --> 56:56.620
because I get to see everybody sort of saying like,

56:56.620 --> 57:00.020
hey, it means a lot to see so many people say, hey, what you do

57:00.020 --> 57:00.820
means something to me.

57:00.820 --> 57:03.020
And I'm going to show it by kicking you a few bucks.

57:03.020 --> 57:04.120
It really means the world.

57:04.120 --> 57:08.520
And even if you can just find it in your heart

57:08.520 --> 57:11.920
to give us $5 a month, it really does help keep the lights on

57:11.920 --> 57:13.720
and supports a whole network of people

57:13.720 --> 57:17.020
that are handling a lot of shit so we don't have to.

57:17.020 --> 57:20.120
And we really appreciate you doing that.

57:20.120 --> 57:25.120

57:25.120 --> 57:28.120
I was getting my Munch Squad on at McDonald's breakfast

57:28.120 --> 57:29.120
after work.

57:29.120 --> 57:31.720
When I sat down for my feast, a guy walked in the door,

57:31.720 --> 57:34.120
looked at me, and said, idiot can't even

57:34.120 --> 57:35.220
make his own pancakes.

57:35.220 --> 57:35.920
How pathetic.

57:35.920 --> 57:39.020
Don't laugh at that.

57:39.020 --> 57:42.920
I mean, it's a power play.

57:42.920 --> 57:50.120
Simpson was eating breakfast at McDonald's.

57:50.120 --> 57:52.620
And then they sat down to eat.

57:52.620 --> 57:55.320
A guy walked in the door, looked at them,

57:55.320 --> 57:57.620
and said, idiot can't make his own pancakes.

57:57.620 --> 57:58.520
How pathetic.

57:58.520 --> 58:00.620
And then walked back out.

58:00.620 --> 58:01.820
What is this?

58:01.820 --> 58:04.320
What?

58:04.320 --> 58:05.620
What is this?

58:05.620 --> 58:09.620
What is this fucking mysterious assassin?

58:09.620 --> 58:10.920
I tried to enjoy my meal.

58:10.920 --> 58:13.520
But all I could taste were dejection and tears.

58:13.520 --> 58:14.920
How could I track this guy down?

58:14.920 --> 58:18.120
Explain how restaurants work.

58:18.120 --> 58:19.920
Project the image of a man who definitely

58:19.920 --> 58:21.920
understands the process of making pancakes

58:21.920 --> 58:23.420
to every stranger I encounter.

58:23.420 --> 58:26.820
And that's from Hobbs.

58:26.820 --> 58:28.020
Here's the thing.

58:28.020 --> 58:31.420
This thing this person did was wrong,

58:31.420 --> 58:34.720
but also, I think, very funny, maybe, also.

58:34.720 --> 58:37.220
Because the alternative is you walk into a pizza

58:37.220 --> 58:39.020
and you're like, all these fucking idiots

58:39.020 --> 58:40.620
don't know how to make their own pizza.

58:40.620 --> 58:43.120
Bye.

58:43.120 --> 58:44.520
Very funny.

58:44.520 --> 58:47.220
I think a nicer, there's a nicer way of doing this.

58:47.220 --> 58:49.220
Here's the nicer, amazing way of doing this.

58:49.220 --> 58:50.620
Walk into McDonald's, see someone

58:50.620 --> 58:52.720
eating a stack of pancakes, hand them

58:52.720 --> 58:55.220
a recipe for pancakes, and then walk out the door.

58:55.220 --> 58:56.620
That's a sweet way of doing it.

58:56.620 --> 58:57.620
You're right, Justin.

58:57.620 --> 58:58.820
This is the na-bim-bam way of doing it.

58:58.820 --> 58:59.420
That's a nice way of doing it.

58:59.420 --> 59:01.320
You walk in and you hand them a recipe for pancakes.

59:01.320 --> 59:02.120
Still hilarious.

59:02.120 --> 59:03.520
And you say, for next time.

59:03.520 --> 59:05.220
For next time, try this.

59:05.220 --> 59:05.920
Go for it.

59:05.920 --> 59:06.720
And it's fun.

59:06.720 --> 59:07.620
Hey, it's fun.

59:07.620 --> 59:08.520
I want to be.

59:08.520 --> 59:09.920
If you do it wrong, they're crepes.

59:09.920 --> 59:10.520
It's fine.

59:10.520 --> 59:13.320
I want to be in the head of the person who's

59:13.320 --> 59:15.420
walking by McDonald's, sees someone

59:15.420 --> 59:17.420
eating a stack of flapjacks, and is like,

59:17.420 --> 59:19.420
I got to go in there and say something.

59:19.420 --> 59:20.220
I got to get them.

59:20.220 --> 59:22.620
Fucking double parts.

59:22.620 --> 59:25.020
Just falls up on the lot of McDonald's,

59:25.020 --> 59:29.820
and rolls out, Victoria, just go around the block.

59:29.820 --> 59:31.620
I'm just going to be a sec.

59:31.620 --> 59:32.820
Oh, but you grabbed me a biscuit.

59:32.820 --> 59:33.720
No, you don't understand.

59:33.720 --> 59:34.220
You don't get it.

59:34.220 --> 59:34.820
You don't get it.

59:34.820 --> 59:36.320
I'm not getting anything in there.

59:36.320 --> 59:38.720
No, I think they went in wanting to buy something,

59:38.720 --> 59:41.820
and then they just had to put this thing up front.

59:41.820 --> 59:43.720
They have pancakes here.

59:43.720 --> 59:45.220
You can do this at home.

59:45.220 --> 59:46.420
OK, but what could?

59:46.420 --> 59:49.620
OK, pancakes, I think, are very easy to make at home.

59:49.620 --> 59:50.720
And I think they probably are.

59:50.720 --> 59:52.320
I've never had restaurant pancakes.

59:52.320 --> 59:54.020
Deceptively difficult, Justin.

59:54.020 --> 59:56.320
Well, it's hitting the right pan temperature.

59:56.320 --> 59:57.020
Come on.

59:57.020 --> 59:59.220
None of the things that McDonald's will worry about,

59:59.220 --> 01:00:01.020
in any way, shape, or form, when they're perfecting it.

01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:02.020
When they're defrosting.

01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:03.020
When they're defrosting.

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:06.620
Now, it is undeniable that McDonald's

01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:11.820
does have dark, arcane breakfast treats that know.

01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:14.420
Like, you tell me how they make that McGriddle.

01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:16.420
Tell me how to make a McGriddle right now.

01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:18.820
With the biscuit, with the syrup nugs.

01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:22.220
They have these magical crystals of syrup that somehow, like.

01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:24.220
A wizard gave them, like a syrup wizard.

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:26.020
A Canadian syrup wizard.

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:27.420
A maple witch.

01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:29.620
That's why it was such a big deal when they did breakfast

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:32.120
all day, because they're burning through the non-renewable

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:34.620
resource of syrup crystals so fast.

01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:35.820
You've run out of syrup crystals.

01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:37.220
We're running low on syrup crystals.

01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:38.020
We're running low.

01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:38.820
Call the maple witch.

01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:44.120
Listen, I know we try to keep it nice on this show.

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.520
We try to be mean.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.220
This is maybe the funniest thing I've ever read.

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:50.020
I'm really trying so hard not to get entertained.

01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:51.220
It's not funny that you got bullied.

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:53.020
And it's not funny that this person's an ass.

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:56.220
What's funny is the idea of walking into a restaurant just

01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:59.520
all pre-angry that people here are eating things that they

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:01.220
could just as easily make at home.

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:05.020
It's just so good.

01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:06.820
It's so good, though.

01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:08.220
Oh, man.

01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:09.820
Do they walk into auto body shops?

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:12.020
And they're like, change your own oil, idiots.

01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:13.820
Idiot doesn't even know how to change it.

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:16.620
Idiot doesn't even know how to do a triple bypass.

01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:18.920
Dumb.

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:20.920
Wow, it's just very mean, but very funny.

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.520
And I don't think it's even that mean.

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:23.520
It's real life trolling.

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:24.720
It's exactly what it is.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:25.220
Yeah.

01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:26.220
Well, then I'm not.

01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:26.920
Now you've ruined it.

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.020
Now I'm not for it anymore.

01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:28.920
I don't know.

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:30.420
It's just, it's just.

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:32.720
If this happened to me, it would make my fucking week.

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:33.220
Oh, really?

01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:34.120
It would ruin my life.

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.220
I would be really bummed out.

01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:36.320
If someone did this to you?

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:37.520
If I went to McDonald's and somebody

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.620
put me on blast for eating pancakes at McDonald's,

01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:40.720
I think I'd feel probably pretty bad.

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.320
Well, let's start with the big problems.

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.720
One, you're eating in the McDonald's.

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:45.920
Which we've talked about.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:48.120
We've talked about, like, yeah, there's

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:50.520
some problems about eating inside the fast food establishment.

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:51.320
There's probably.

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:53.120
Fast food restaurants are, by definition,

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.120
a gun that shoots burgers at you.

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.720
So for you to go inside the gun to retrieve the burgers

01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:01.720
from the dragon's hoard is.

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:03.420
Would this affect you less if you were, like,

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:04.720
at an IHOP, Griffin?

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:07.620
Or, like, some place, like a fancy, IHOP's not fancy.

01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:08.420
I'm trying to think.

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:10.620
I can't think if there's not, like, if you went to, like.

01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:14.120
If a stranger yelled at me about the food I was eating,

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:15.120
I don't give a fuck.

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:19.520
I don't care if I'm at the Jiro dreams of sushi restaurant.

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:21.120
Somebody kicks in the door and is, like,

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.320
can't make your own sushi.

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:25.520
I'm, like, oh, my dinner's ruined.

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:26.720
Wait, hold on.

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.920
If you were at the fanciest sushi place.

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:30.520
Jiro dreams of sushi.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:32.320
And somebody just walked in and was, like, idiot.

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:33.920
Can't make his own sushi.

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:36.120
Your first reaction would be, like, he's right.

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:39.120
No, my first reaction would be, oh, no.

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.520
A stranger yelled at me.

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:44.120
How are you not getting that?

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:46.520
I don't want a stranger to yell at me for any situation

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:48.920
in any circumstance whatsoever.

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:50.720
I would like to read the question before.

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:53.520
It's just a perfect.

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.520
I think that this question asks that this probably really

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.320
happened in their real life.

01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:59.520
But it's a great TV show episode.

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:00.020
OK.

01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:01.520
A little while ago, I was messaged

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:03.120
by someone on a gaming website that they

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:05.820
lived in the same area as me and were interested in getting

01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:07.820
together to play a local game of Rock Band

01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:10.120
to try and beat the four hour long endless set

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.020
list of all songs in the game.

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:13.020
I agreed.

01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:15.620
And after we settled on a time to meet up and do this,

01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:17.520
I drove to the address he gave me.

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.920
After sending my location in case

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.720
this was an attempt to lure me into a saw like trap,

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:25.920
I rang the doorbell only to discover that it was even worse.

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.720
And the guy who invited me was a high school sophomore

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.720
less than half my age.

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:33.320
To make things more awkward, his mom

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:36.320
was also there doing weekend cleaning and vacuuming

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:37.120
the house.

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:40.320
I stayed and played the entire four hour session.

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.520
Well, yeah.

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:45.020
But nobody who was there in that house

01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:47.520
acknowledged how awkward and weird this was.

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:49.920
And when it ended, I quickly gathered my things

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:51.920
and got away as quickly as I could.

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.720
Could I have done anything to make

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:55.520
this situation less awkward?

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:58.420
As a man in his 30s, am I just too old

01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:00.620
to be meeting up to play video games with strangers

01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:01.420
from the internet?

01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:03.720
And that's from Rock Band Regrets in the Pacific

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:04.920
Northwest.

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:06.720
Rush more.

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.320
Rush more.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:09.320
It's a rush more.

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.120
We got a real life rush more.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:12.120
It's a real life rush more.

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:15.020
You got the opportunity to mold young minds.

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:17.520
And it's just like, you're just like paradiddle, paradiddle,

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.320
like hitting those drums and playing along

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.520
to the Killers or whatever the fuck's in Rock Band.

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:24.320
And then you just look at them, you're like, boom, da, da, da.

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:25.320
So you dating?

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:27.120
Do, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:29.120
You know what the best character in this story is?

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:29.920
It's the mom.

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:30.520
Yeah.

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:33.220
The mom who's just cleaning and is like, what's going on?

01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:34.020
What's going on?

01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:34.820
OK.

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:35.820
Well, have fun.

01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:37.620
Does the goosh, does the goosh, does the goosh.

01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:39.320
Have you ever wanted to be a ward?

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.020
If you ever wanted to be somebody's ward,

01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:42.020
you could be my ward.

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:43.120
Does the goosh, does the goosh.

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.120
Honey, are you going to be that man's ward?

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:45.820
OK.

01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:46.620
That's fine.

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:47.420
Just have fun.

01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:48.620
Oh, you're playing Rush?

01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:49.820
That seems fun.

01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:51.120
OK, bye.

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.420
A worse thing has happened to me than this.

01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:55.020
Oops.

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:57.420
I used to work at a newspaper called The Iron Twin Tribune.

01:04:57.420 --> 01:04:58.820
And we had this feature called The Dart.

01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:00.220
And the way The Dart worked is you

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:03.220
would throw a dart at Lawrence County, where we covered.

01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:04.720
And you would throw a dart at Lawrence.

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.120
And he would try to get out of the way of it.

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:07.020
Hey, stop it.

01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:07.820
Stop it.

01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:09.220
Oh, my face.

01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:10.720
Throw a dart at a map of Lawrence County.

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:14.220
And you would go to where The Dart landed and find news there.

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:18.220
Lawrence County does not have the density

01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:19.420
to support this concept.

01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:21.520
But we did The Dart every week.

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:22.920
And I went to this location.

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.220
It was the job everybody hated.

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:26.720
And we would all fight each other to not have to do it.

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:27.720
And I went to The Dart.

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:31.720
And I walked around this block for about a half hour

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:35.320
before I finally found two teens sitting on their stoop.

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:37.620
And they're the only humans I'd encountered.

01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:39.620
So I said, like, well, you guys obviously

01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:40.720
you guys got any news?

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:41.420
What are you guys doing?

01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:42.420
What's the scoop?

01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:45.020
They were like, well, no, we're not doing anything.

01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:46.220
I was like, um.

01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:47.120
Could you do something?

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:48.220
What are you about to do?

01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:50.420
And they're like, well, we're going to play DDR.

01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:54.020
And I was like, OK, can I come with you?

01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:54.820
Justin.

01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:55.620
Justin.

01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:56.920
Justin Tyler.

01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:58.620
No, I want you to know the feeling

01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:00.620
that I'm feeling right now is pride.

01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:01.420
It's surprise.

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:02.220
It's pride.

01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:04.820
I'm feeling pride that Justin approached human beings

01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:06.620
and then invited himself along with them.

01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:07.620
It's part of being a reporter.

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:09.220
It's why I quit, because I was so bad at it.

01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:10.620
And I was like, are your parents here?

01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:12.020
And they're like, yeah, no problem.

01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:14.420
And I went to their dad, I think.

01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:16.420
I was like, I gave him the whole spiel.

01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:18.420
I was like, I'm just going to watch them play DDR

01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:20.820
and take a couple of pictures and then write about it.

01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:24.620
And he's like, OK.

01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:25.920
Did you pitch a headline?

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:28.220
Did you have a headline to this frickin' news?

01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:31.120
Two boys step right.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:34.620
Local teens play DDR as obese man watches

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:37.220
from fucking Star Wars sheets.

01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:38.920
So I went up and sat on their bunk bed

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:41.420
and took pictures of these teens playing DDR.

01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:44.820
And like, no one knew when it had been enough.

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:45.620
Like, I did.

01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:47.220
I kept waiting for the story.

01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:48.020
We got it.

01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:49.520
Right, I kept waiting for something like.

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:52.420
I would have known.

01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:55.120
Had you invited me along as a sort of assistant,

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:58.420
I would have been able to tell you this is enough.

01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:00.620
I kept waiting for something newsworthy to happen.

01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:05.220
Oh, I did play DDR and it made North Korea change their ways.

01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:07.820
I did one on a corner where there

01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:09.920
was a sign answer for Pizza Hut and a sign

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:12.120
answer for Domino's on opposite corners.

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:14.320
See, that's an American This American Life episode.

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.320
Yeah, that was amazing.

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:16.320
Called the Pizza Wars.

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:20.620
I got an Ohio Associated Press Award for that one.

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:21.520
Fuck yeah, dude.

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:22.520
Yeah, man.

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:26.720
I was a prize-winning business reporter back in the day.

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:29.120
One last time, thank you so much for listening.

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:31.020
Thank you for all the years of listening.

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:33.320
Thank you to people who have donated in the past.

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:35.120
And please, if you're not donating now

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:36.420
or you could donate a little bit more,

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:38.720
we ask you to just go to MaximumFun.org

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:42.120
and click that Donate button and let's just get it rolling.

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:44.620
And then from now on, when you listen to Max Fun shows,

01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:46.520
you could say, hey, I helped make that.

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:48.420
I was part of that and I helped make that.

01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:50.420
And it would really mean a lot to us.

01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:53.620
So if you could take the time to do that, $5, $10, $20 a month.

01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:55.720
Yeah, even if you can get in at $5, $5 gets you

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:56.820
all the bonus content.

01:07:56.820 --> 01:08:00.220
And it means that you are a member

01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:01.920
and you support what we do here.

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:06.020
And we appreciate it so much because of you.

01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:09.520
We are able to grow and do more stuff

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.720
and take time off from our jobs to go make dumb TV shows

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:17.520
or to fly to Portland and go do live shows there.

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.520
Or donate it to Fushigi Patronage.

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:20.320
One of those two.

01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:21.620
One of those two things.

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:23.920
One of those two equally responsible.

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:25.520
I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:27.220
for using this theme song into Departure off the album,

01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:28.420
Putting the Days to Bed.

01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:31.620
Good dude, good band, good tunes, man.

01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:32.320
Good times.

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:33.120
Good brews.

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.320
Good brews, good tunes.

01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:34.920
Good waves.

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:37.020
Good dude.

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:39.520
And yeah, thanks to Maximum Fun for having us.

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:41.220
Go check out all the other shows this week.

01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:42.020
That's a fun thing to do.

01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:44.220
If you haven't listened to any other Max Fun shows,

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:46.420
go try one out this week during Max Fun Drive

01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:48.820
because everybody's doing their best stuff,

01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:51.420
putting their best foot forward.

01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:54.420
Yeah, and be sure to check out the Still Buffering bonus

01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:55.120
episode.

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.520
They did My Sister, My Sister, and Me.

01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:58.920
So for their bonus episode, they're

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:02.120
taking advice and doing the bim bam thing.

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:03.120
So that's really fun.

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.420
If you're not listening to that show, you should.

01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:05.820
Yeah, it's awesome.

01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:06.720
You want that final?

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:07.520
Yeah.

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:10.420
I also just want to say, thank you.

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:11.120
Yeah, thank you.

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:13.020
Max Fun Drive is my favorite time of the year

01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:16.220
because it really, not only is it fun and exciting

01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:17.920
and we do a lot of bonus stuff and there's

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:20.020
a lot of events and everything, but it also

01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:22.620
is a two-week period where I get to remember,

01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:27.520
like be reminded that we wouldn't be where we are.

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:30.220
We wouldn't have a TV show if it wasn't for support.

01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:33.120
We wouldn't have the opportunities that we've had

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:37.320
and have come down to being on Max Fun, listeners like you,

01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:38.320
and support.

01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:40.220
And it just means the world to me.

01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:41.520
And it shows me up every time.

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:44.220
Every Max Fun Drive, I just feel so lucky

01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:45.320
to be part of this network.

01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:47.820
So thank you.

01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:49.020
Here comes that final.

01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:51.120
And it was sent in by Amelia Berger.

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:51.920
Thank you, Amelia.

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:56.720
It's by Yahoo Answers user Help Me Find My Son, who asks,

01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:00.120
is watching Air Bud on a portable DVD player in my car

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.820
too intimate for a first date?

01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:05.820
My name is Joseph McElroy.

01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:06.920
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:07.820
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:10.720
And my brother, my brother and me kiss your dad square

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:11.320
on the lips.

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:16.320
Hey, girls, do you want to say, hey, I want to?
