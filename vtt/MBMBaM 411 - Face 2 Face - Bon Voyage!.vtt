00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.960
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the

00:48.960 --> 01:04.080
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin Tyler McElroy. And I'm your sweet baby brother

01:04.080 --> 01:14.800
in 30 Under 30 Media Luminary, Griffin Andrew McElroy. Justin's fucking kick flip over the

01:14.800 --> 01:19.200
monitor there in the middle is the most righteous thing I've ever seen on a stage. Do you want to

01:19.200 --> 01:25.920
hear something really sad? Yeah, I did it for the vine. Man, I still do a lot of stuff for the vine,

01:25.920 --> 01:32.720
but it doesn't seem to be ending up on the platform. Yeah, not yet. I'm doing stuff all

01:32.720 --> 01:36.480
the time where I think in my head after I do it like, certainly that's gonna be on the line.

01:37.440 --> 01:41.920
That's that was for the vine. They didn't they didn't send their folks that day to capture your

01:41.920 --> 01:55.040
sick stunt. Oh, boy. Hi, everybody. A lot of you said hi at the same time, which I which I

01:55.040 --> 02:00.160
appreciated. We're very happy to be here in San Francisco. And we're very happy to be doing a

02:00.160 --> 02:07.120
show show didn't almost it almost didn't happen. Yeah, because earlier today, we were so hungry.

02:07.120 --> 02:12.640
Yeah, that we almost killed each other. We almost broke up. We almost broke up with us broke up. It

02:12.640 --> 02:17.360
was almost the wedge. You don't know this, because you only think about it in like a, you know,

02:17.360 --> 02:21.920
relationship. But if family gets together, sometimes they're like, I'm so hungry that I'm

02:21.920 --> 02:28.160
angry at all of you. You want to break up. Here's how here's how hungry we were. And by we I mean

02:28.160 --> 02:35.680
Griffin. We went back, we got some publicity photos taken of us for the first time in eight years

02:35.680 --> 02:42.560
never happened before finally getting serious about this podcasting thing. It might just be a

02:42.560 --> 02:46.960
thing. And if from now on, if you see a publicity photo of us, you can say to your friend, Hey,

02:46.960 --> 02:50.240
I know I'm always telling you this whenever I see a publicity photo of the McElroy's,

02:50.240 --> 02:55.840
but that was taken in San Francisco. And you can also say and I know we're back. One of them was

02:55.840 --> 03:00.720
very hungry. One of them was super hungry. Here's how hungry we got back from taking the photos and

03:00.720 --> 03:07.200
and Griffin says, hand to God direct quote, Oh, hell yeah, there's a bird King right there.

03:08.720 --> 03:19.040
All right, Griffin, I, I was also very sleepy. All of my moodlets were in the red. And so my plan

03:19.040 --> 03:28.560
was to slam some BK feel like big shit. Go sleep, which is like my that's like my best my favorite

03:28.560 --> 03:33.840
state of being is drifting off to sleep. Like, I wonder if I'm gonna have diarrhea when I wake up.

03:34.800 --> 03:39.760
That's not a bit for this show. Griffin's not doing it for the vine right now. He told us when

03:39.760 --> 03:45.440
we went to eat lunch at a lovely Indian place called Punjab. I think it was Indian and Pakistani

03:45.440 --> 03:50.480
food is delicious. It's fucking great. So good. Griffin told us while we're eating lunch like I

03:50.480 --> 03:54.160
it wasn't that I want to Burger King. I just love feeling sick and taking a nap.

03:54.160 --> 04:00.000
It was also great as we're I will back away from the mic for this moment. But as we were walking

04:00.000 --> 04:06.080
to the restaurant, I said, Hmm, seems like some of us are hangry and Griffin went. Yeah. Yeah,

04:06.080 --> 04:15.840
I yelled. I did yell. At that point, I was so angry. That my family didn't want to eat a Burger

04:15.840 --> 04:23.360
King. He was mad at us. So mad. He sat down at the table when we finally got to the restaurant.

04:23.360 --> 04:28.000
And he just kept saying like, This doesn't feel like real life. This feels like a dream.

04:28.640 --> 04:32.880
And I told him I live in West Virginia, right? There's seven different places I can eat.

04:32.880 --> 04:39.280
There's a Burger King and six Bojangles. And like, I'm not gonna eat at one of the places I

04:39.280 --> 04:44.400
can eat at home. The Bojangles are organized around the Burger King like they're protecting

04:44.400 --> 04:49.920
it. When the Bojangles open in Huntington, they became Knights of the Round. Thank you.

04:49.920 --> 04:54.320
When the Bojangles opened in Huntington, they had to put up a road sign outside like to direct

04:54.320 --> 04:59.600
traffic for Bojangles. This is the line for Bojangles. The Bojangles line took up this

04:59.600 --> 05:04.320
entire lane of traffic. Can we tell one other anecdote? We're gonna get into the questions,

05:04.320 --> 05:10.800
I promise. But can you? It's about the airport. They were at the airport. I don't want to brag.

05:11.680 --> 05:17.920
But he's going to. When I travel, I fly Delta. And when I fly Delta, I hang out in the Delta

05:17.920 --> 05:23.680
Sky Club. It's not a big deal. And I overheard the best thing I've ever heard someone say

05:24.400 --> 05:30.080
twice from the same person. The first thing they said was, I'm sorry to interrupt. I couldn't help

05:30.080 --> 05:38.720
but overhearing you talking about chili. I love chili. And that made me so happy that I immediately

05:38.720 --> 05:44.240
dropped everything. I think I looked at dad and said, shut up, shut up. And then about three

05:44.240 --> 05:49.200
minutes later. Dad's very used to that. Yeah. And then about three minutes later, same person said,

05:49.920 --> 05:57.840
well, I'd have to say that my favorite bean is... And at that point, I couldn't hear the rest of it

05:57.840 --> 06:03.440
because my brain exploded. And I was just so happy. It's like, whoa, you're really putting me

06:03.440 --> 06:10.880
on the spot here. My favorite bean. You know, it pushed. Was it one of us 30 years older time

06:10.880 --> 06:15.680
traveling and recording an episode of My Brother, My Brother and Me? That's the only explanation.

06:15.680 --> 06:20.160
I just love the idea of here's a person butting into a conversation that they were not a part of

06:20.160 --> 06:28.160
and then thinking, you know what these people want to hear about? My bean thoughts. Quick poll.

06:28.160 --> 06:38.720
It's black beans, right? Okay. The best beans. I prefer a red bean. I defer to the beanologist who

06:38.720 --> 06:43.520
is Justin McElroy. Oh God. Now people can see that we've got some unpleasant aesthetic overlap.

06:43.520 --> 06:47.200
I tried to keep the jacket on as long as I could. It's a little toasty.

06:49.600 --> 06:52.880
It does pretty much naturally sum up our summer aesthetics,

06:52.880 --> 06:55.840
which is you have the tropical shirt, I have a Hawaiian shirt and Griffin dresses like it's

06:55.840 --> 07:03.040
winter. Also at the Delta Sky Club, I got to listen to my brother explain to a very nice lady

07:03.040 --> 07:09.600
who was working there why he had a pin of himself on his lapel. She actually asked,

07:10.320 --> 07:14.480
where did you get that done? Because my nephew would love that. I'm going to get a pin of him

07:15.120 --> 07:20.240
for himself. And at first I thought, oh, this is good to put it in context. And then I thought,

07:20.240 --> 07:26.000
no, actually it sounds worse to say, I thought people liked me enough to want to buy it.

07:27.200 --> 07:31.520
So it's not like a vanity thing I did for just me. I thought people would want enough to want

07:31.520 --> 07:37.840
to buy it. And also I got one and I'm wearing it now. You see this little face, check it up here.

07:40.240 --> 07:45.760
I also think she did say, same face. Like, cause I made the face. She was like,

07:45.760 --> 07:51.600
is that the same face as the pin? Yeah. How about we do the shit?

07:53.280 --> 07:57.680
This is an advice show as you've almost certainly guessed. And here's our first question. How do I

07:57.680 --> 08:02.000
get my friend to stop going through all my cabinets every time he comes to my house?

08:04.640 --> 08:10.720
Is that seriously it? That's it. How do I get my, no context necessary.

08:12.400 --> 08:19.120
Are you here? You're very close. Okay. Let me help. Your friend is here.

08:19.120 --> 08:26.800
Oh, shit. Hold on. All right. So here's the thing. Your friend,

08:26.800 --> 08:29.280
whether they'll admit to it or not. Can I get a name real quick?

08:31.360 --> 08:34.880
This is going to be deeply uncomfortable. We are going to pretend like you're not here or else we

08:34.880 --> 08:40.400
can't get it going. Or the whole show unravels. I'm going to look up here and I hope you don't

08:40.400 --> 08:45.360
mind that, but I'm going to be at sort of balcony level with my eyesight. Oh yeah.

08:45.360 --> 08:51.840
What's real quick. What's your, what's your name? I just heard Barfi because they blended in the

08:51.840 --> 08:59.440
air in a. Okay. What's your name? Murphy and Tom. Okay. So Murphy, pretend your friend,

08:59.440 --> 09:04.560
let's call him Greg. Greg is going through the cabinets. Here's what he's looking for. He's

09:04.560 --> 09:09.920
looking for granny's treat drawer. Every granny's got one. Let me hear you real quick. Does your

09:09.920 --> 09:15.840
granny have a treat drawer, everybody? Yes. Yes. It's got the fruit roll-ups. It's got the ring

09:15.840 --> 09:19.920
pops. Whenever the grandkids come over, she wants to score some quick points. She pulls open this

09:19.920 --> 09:24.160
special drawer and there's pixie six, pixie six, pixie six. Oh, that's great. Cause there's a bowl

09:24.160 --> 09:28.480
of like bowl of fruit on the counter. So the parents are like, ah, fruit. Great. And then

09:28.480 --> 09:34.640
they leave and granny's like, no, no. Let's party idiots. Granny fucking heavyweights it.

09:34.640 --> 09:40.640
She pulls off the banister off the stairs. It's full of some, I can't think of a type of candy

09:40.640 --> 09:47.280
guys. Her shoe laces are candy laces. I heard a wallpaper is candy dots. Nobody likes those.

09:48.720 --> 09:53.760
There's so much work for so little payoff with a candy dot and you're getting at least 5% paper.

09:53.760 --> 09:58.720
Your friend is looking for granny's treat drawer. So, but granny moves it sometimes because the

09:58.720 --> 10:04.400
parents will get, the rents, if you'll allow, will get wise. So granny moves it. So your friend

10:04.400 --> 10:08.240
is going through all your cabinets, looking for your treat drawer. And you know, you've got one

10:08.240 --> 10:13.760
if you're a grandmother. I can't, it's fairly dark out there. I can't tell. And I wouldn't want

10:13.760 --> 10:20.880
to make it. How many grandmothers do we have here tonight? Granny's in the house. Oh, so your friend

10:22.160 --> 10:27.840
your friend is looking for that cookie crisp. Is your friend opening these cabinets in like a

10:27.840 --> 10:35.680
fevered way or just very slowly like, hmm. Deeply hungry every time. Is your friend a raccoon? Once

10:35.680 --> 10:43.120
again, assuming I can't see them. Half raccoon. Interesting. I've seen some pictures of that on

10:43.120 --> 10:54.000
the internet. Daddy like. Usually they're dating Sonic. Yes. You got to leave your treats in an

10:54.000 --> 11:00.400
easily accessible place. Take the box of cookie crisp, or if they're looking for weed, whatever

11:00.400 --> 11:06.400
it is, leave it on the counter. Usually one of those leads to the other one. Yeah, there's

11:06.400 --> 11:11.280
inextricably tied. Leave your treats on the counter. And then he's not gonna have to root

11:11.280 --> 11:16.720
through. He'll just say, oh, your weed. It's right here. Oh, your cookie crisp is right. Oh,

11:16.720 --> 11:24.640
you put the weed in the cookie crisp. Let me suggest I'm a parent now and I have a 19 month

11:24.640 --> 11:34.160
old daughter who just. We all have kids. She doesn't understand boundaries. So we had to put

11:34.160 --> 11:41.440
child locks on everything and child locks are great because don't let the name fool you.

11:41.440 --> 11:46.240
They confound everyone. Yeah, it's great. It's great appetite control too, because sometimes

11:46.240 --> 11:52.320
I'll want a loose fistful of cookie crisp at three 30 p.m. On a Wednesday and I'll walk up to

11:52.320 --> 11:58.400
the drawer and pull it and get a chunk and I'll be like, fuck it. It's not. Hey, Griffin, would you

11:58.400 --> 12:06.480
be so kind as to treat me to a Yahoo? I would love to. Yes. I know. Did you guys see when we

12:06.480 --> 12:13.760
were driving to the photo shoot today? Yahoo HQ. We passed it and they were like, thank you for

12:13.760 --> 12:21.120
being the only people who use our website. There's probably employees here. Oh, shit. Shit.

12:22.720 --> 12:27.600
Well, now we can't fucking ask because we spoiled the the waters of polling. But

12:27.600 --> 12:35.120
we'll just got it. Who here isn't an employee of Yahoo? Jesus. So subtract that.

12:36.800 --> 12:41.680
All right. This one was sent in by Grin Velesty. Thank you, Grin. It's Yahoo Answers user

12:41.680 --> 12:49.760
Brandy who asks, are you allowed to put baby on board sticker when driving motorcycle in California?

12:53.760 --> 12:58.720
Obviously, obviously you are not allowed to put baby and motorcycle in Cali.

12:58.720 --> 13:01.040
But I thought it would be funny if I put fascists.

13:04.560 --> 13:08.240
But I thought it would be funny if I put a sticker on the back of my black

13:08.240 --> 13:15.040
hellite vest. I am wearing that say baby on board. It is a it's a little giggly joke.

13:22.480 --> 13:27.760
Oh, okay. But I think but I think it would make me more visible and safer while having some quick

13:27.760 --> 13:32.640
laugh. On top of that, ever since I put the sticker, no. Okay, so you already pulled the

13:32.640 --> 13:39.280
trigger on this one. No one no one is tailgating me on my street bike. I'm not sure what the

13:39.280 --> 13:44.880
psychology behind it, but people seem to be more careful around me. They are keeping distance.

13:44.880 --> 13:50.320
People that wants to pass over me will make a lot of room to switch to my lane. You can't.

13:51.520 --> 13:57.920
It minimize people that are having road rage as well. And then and then

13:57.920 --> 14:01.760
and then baby on board. End of sentence.

14:09.440 --> 14:16.560
So is this illegal to put this last thing I want is some random out you. I have so much.

14:17.680 --> 14:22.720
Last thing I want is some random law that people can find a loop to do something crazy.

14:22.720 --> 14:32.320
Easy. You can't. You can't say that you don't understand the psychology

14:33.200 --> 14:39.920
of why people might be more cautious. Even if there's a 1% chance there's a baby on your

14:39.920 --> 14:48.080
motorcycle. Yeah, for me, even if the Vegas odds trend heavily towards there's not a baby on that

14:48.080 --> 14:56.400
moving object. If I if I see a motorcyclist, which is the proper term with a baby on board sticker

14:56.400 --> 15:01.520
on the back of their jacket, I'm going to assume two things are possible. One is a person with a

15:01.520 --> 15:08.480
baby stuffed into their jacket or two. It's a person with nothing left to lose. Either way,

15:08.480 --> 15:15.520
I'm going to give them their space. The I would have also gone three three babies in a coat.

15:15.520 --> 15:21.840
Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Yes, thank you. I do like that this question asker make sure to

15:21.840 --> 15:27.120
denote that you can't put a baby on a motorcycle in California. Thank you. Are there states? Oh,

15:27.120 --> 15:32.560
for sure. For sure. For sure. For sure. For sure. Wait, hold on. I'm sorry. I didn't.

15:32.560 --> 15:38.800
If there's a sidecar, I get it. God, that I would be willing to bet dollars to

15:38.800 --> 15:43.520
donuts. There are states where you don't even need one of those. There's some wild state laws

15:43.520 --> 15:48.880
out there, man. In fucking like in fucking Florida, you can like shoot a whale from a moving

15:48.880 --> 15:55.680
helicopter. There's a law somewhere that's like, go for it. We got lots of babies.

15:58.960 --> 16:08.640
I think that this could be applicable in lots of arenas. If you have a shirt that just says

16:08.640 --> 16:13.920
baby on board, I think you're going to avoid a lot of conflict because you're going to buy

16:13.920 --> 16:20.320
yourself an extra half second where the person's like, is there? I don't see a baby on board,

16:20.320 --> 16:27.120
but I guess it could be in a satchel. Just let them have their fun. You know, it's just a little

16:27.120 --> 16:35.200
giggle. It's just a giggle joke. Just one giggly joke. Could you think if you were the person

16:35.200 --> 16:44.560
behind that wheel? I would think they had a motorcycle basket with a baby. Yeah. On the

16:44.560 --> 16:53.760
front side of it. That's fun to think about. I love my imagination. You all are so lucky to even

16:53.760 --> 17:01.920
be exposed to it. To even get a ray of light from my beautiful imagination sun shining down on you.

17:01.920 --> 17:14.160
Damn. Why are we not giving all motorcyclists a little room? You've seen what they are working

17:14.160 --> 17:20.800
with. Why are you up on them? It will not pan out well for them. Give them all a little bit of space.

17:20.800 --> 17:29.200
I actually think one of you. And that one goes for non-motor cycle. How about what if we just

17:29.200 --> 17:35.120
all don't crash? That's like a coin. Bicycles, motorcycles, penny-farthing bicycles. Yes.

17:36.880 --> 17:40.240
That's the one with the big wheel and the little wheel. Oh, Travis, this is San Francisco. They

17:40.240 --> 17:45.280
know what a penny-farthing bicycle is. That's why I didn't get a laugh because everyone's like,

17:45.280 --> 17:55.840
yes. Yes. Yes. And unicycles. I'm moving back home to Australia tomorrow after a year studying in New

17:55.840 --> 18:02.000
York. I have promised a lot of people that I'll stay in touch with them. I know that I almost

18:02.000 --> 18:09.760
certainly won't do this. And honesty is so important. How soon until I can let them down?

18:12.160 --> 18:19.520
Should I tell them that actually I lied when saying goodbye? That's from Sam. Sam, are you here?

18:19.520 --> 18:28.560
Nice. Okay, I heard a few people cheering with Sam. That could be Sam and Sam's friends,

18:28.560 --> 18:37.920
in which case, bad news. Enjoy these final moments with Sam. Drinking the Sam. You've

18:37.920 --> 18:42.480
only got so much left. Justin, I would like you to say to me, let's keep in touch and I will

18:42.480 --> 18:51.200
demonstrate how Sam should have handled this situation. Okay. Hey, let's keep in touch.

18:51.200 --> 18:58.400
The old mouth full of peanut butter gag. The old Mr. Ed. I love it. Well, that way,

18:58.400 --> 19:01.920
three years later, when they realized, I haven't heard from Sam in a while, like, wait, did he say

19:01.920 --> 19:09.120
yes? By definition, you don't have to worry about this. Here's what is so charming to me,

19:09.120 --> 19:14.320
and perhaps this speaks to the Australian sensibility. I don't know a lot of your people,

19:14.320 --> 19:21.920
but I do want to know, I think it's so rad that you have a notch of caring that is caring what

19:21.920 --> 19:27.360
they think about me, not caring to see whether they live or die. That is just, you are right

19:27.360 --> 19:33.360
there and you have a setting for that, which I think is so lovely. If it were me, I'd just be

19:33.360 --> 19:45.120
like, yeah, okay, bye. All right. Sounds good. Dead to me. They are as dust. You gave too

19:45.120 --> 19:50.080
concrete of a response, Sam. Next time, you got to be more mysterious with the other people.

19:50.080 --> 20:01.600
Just look up and say, shh, it is in the wind. Bon voyage. It is important that you be on a boat.

20:01.600 --> 20:08.160
That is pulling out. I have gathered you all here for an announcement. It is in the wind.

20:08.160 --> 20:14.960
Bon voyage. All of your friends gathered. The size of the boat doesn't matter, but I recommend

20:14.960 --> 20:19.920
bigger the better. Bigger the better. Yeah, that's true. Gather everyone you've met that you've told

20:19.920 --> 20:26.640
you to keep in contact and say, friends, I have sad news. I know we have promised to keep in touch,

20:26.640 --> 20:36.480
but I am Sam. It is in the wind. Bon voyage. Then maybe do that thing where you put one foot up on

20:36.480 --> 20:41.200
the prow of the ship as you look out over the ocean. Then they think, who knows where Sam's

20:41.200 --> 20:47.200
going to end up? You could say, haven't you seen Before Sunrise? It's way more romantic. If we

20:47.200 --> 20:54.720
don't make any firm plans, if we get back together. Here's the thing, Sam, here's the problem. You are

20:54.720 --> 20:58.640
the one leaving, right? When they say keep in touch, what they're saying is you keep in touch

20:58.640 --> 21:03.200
with me. How about when they say keep in touch, you say, you touch me, and then you leave.

21:03.920 --> 21:10.640
I got a lot of people who want Sam to touch them. Nothing else beyond you touch me. In that tone of

21:10.640 --> 21:15.440
voice, like I was speaking to my family when they turned me down for Burger King, around that,

21:15.440 --> 21:21.360
sort of like, you touch me, and then you leave. Then you're gone. Have you considered a monthly

21:21.360 --> 21:29.920
newsletter? The Samsung Times. About your new products that you're putting out. How about a

21:29.920 --> 21:39.760
Yahoo? Yep. Here's one we got from a few folks. It's from Yahoo Answers user, Bunny W. We are on

21:39.760 --> 21:46.480
a streak of two Yahoos with usernames I can read, which is a new high score. It's because you're in

21:46.480 --> 21:51.600
San Francisco. We're so close. I'm getting the direct feed. He just ran over and handed,

21:51.600 --> 21:55.680
oh, hot off the presses. I'm connected to Yahoo through Bluetooth right now.

21:58.080 --> 22:07.200
Bunny says, how do I breed my carpet python? A vet recommended we bred our carpet python.

22:07.200 --> 22:12.400
Any advice? Update. I have a female carpet python, and our vet recommended we bred her.

22:12.400 --> 22:24.880
Carpet python sounds like a euphemism that I can't parse. Yeah. Sounds like what you'd

22:24.880 --> 22:36.960
call like a couch's dick. Hey, did you check out the carpet python on that couch? Yeah. Yeah,

22:36.960 --> 22:43.040
dude. Yeah, man. Gnarly stuff. Wayfair does got just what I need.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.760
There is no place- Talk about love scenes.

22:51.760 --> 23:07.120
I submit there is no place that you could put a dick on a couch where it would continue to

23:07.120 --> 23:13.520
be a functional couch, right? Where would it even go? Where would it go? Don't tell me between

23:13.520 --> 23:18.880
the cushions because that's the mouth. That's the mouth of the couch. If you're wild about

23:18.880 --> 23:26.000
couch dick, I'm not here to yuck any yums, but I just like to sit down. So you just slap

23:26.000 --> 23:34.080
the two snakes together is what I understand. Well, you got to get them hard first. Yeah.

23:34.800 --> 23:38.560
You get them hard and horny. Like thunder sticks at a football game.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.520
You give one of them the old boo-boo-zela.

23:43.520 --> 23:48.960
And then you turn it into a poodle. And then it's hard as hell and ready to

23:49.840 --> 23:56.080
and then you just slap those two snakes together. Come hell or high water. And they put on some

23:56.080 --> 24:01.280
sexy snake music. White snake. Thank you. And you just slap them together.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.640
Also could have gone with poison. Sorry, everybody.

24:08.640 --> 24:17.920
Here's the thing. There is a percentage of this room of people who have in the last two minutes

24:17.920 --> 24:22.720
thought about what it would look like for two snakes to have sex. Is it front to front? Is it

24:22.720 --> 24:28.000
front to back? Is it curled into a pretzel? We do not know. Is there a position that doesn't look

24:28.000 --> 24:34.080
like one snake killing the other? Because I can't think of it. Is a caduceus just some rad snake

24:34.080 --> 24:39.920
69-ing? They're wrapped around a snake dildo and they're and they're losing it. They're loving it.

24:39.920 --> 24:47.200
The Ouroboros. The Ouroboros is definitely snake 69. The symbol from the never-ending storybook.

24:47.200 --> 24:51.600
And was potentially what I was thinking of when I said the wrong thing and fucked up.

24:53.680 --> 24:59.840
Here's the thing that bothers me. It still worked, Griffin. Huh? It would still work. It's fine. I

24:59.840 --> 25:04.400
just did the sex toy thing with the staff. It worked fine. Don't beat yourself up. I have seen a lot of

25:04.400 --> 25:13.840
snakes in my life. I don't want to brag. I cannot imagine a quality a snake would have that would

25:13.840 --> 25:21.280
cause me to think that's like a carpet. Because the only thing I can think is a furry snake. Yeah.

25:22.080 --> 25:26.080
Nope. We've got those already. They're called ferrets. Thanks, snakes.

25:26.080 --> 25:31.600
You're a ferret now. We're all full up here, snakes. Wait, hold on. Is that what they're talking about?

25:31.600 --> 25:38.400
Yeah, it's, yeah. I'm looking at it now. Yeah, they're talking about ferrets. That's slang. That's ferret owner slang.

25:38.400 --> 25:43.840
Are they big? Are they small? What's the story with carpet snakes? We could have googled this, I guess.

25:43.840 --> 25:48.960
They're pretty big. No, I did. All right. They're pretty big. Any videos of people slapping them together?

25:48.960 --> 25:58.080
Oh, they got Net Nanny at this venue. They won't let me. But you googled slapping two snakes together.

26:07.040 --> 26:14.320
Hey, baby of your list. I'm so sorry for everything. I googled carpet snakes sex.

26:14.320 --> 26:32.080
Google, in 0.46 seconds, provided me with 10,500,000 results. In less than half a second, Google was like,

26:32.080 --> 26:45.840
Carpet snakes sex, huh? There's videos. There's pictures. There's helpful tips. There's websites. There's a website called ReptileSex.co.uk.

26:47.840 --> 26:57.840
Hey, hold on. There's an urban dictionary for carpet python. Click it. Okay. Griffin is now going to read the urban dictionary definition for carpet python.

26:57.840 --> 27:05.520
Oh, no, I'm not. It's horrible. He's going to read it, and whether or not he says it out loud or not, you can kind of...

27:05.520 --> 27:14.880
No, no, no, no. Don't you look either. Please. No, don't. Please. I love you too much. Please, no.

27:14.880 --> 27:20.080
Oh, okay. If you're listening later. Oh, my God. Look, it's me from the future. I'm coming out on stage.

27:20.080 --> 27:28.080
Hey, listen. Make sure you delete the part where you talk about the urban dictionary. It goes so bad for everybody.

27:30.080 --> 27:36.080
One more question. Yeah. We're going to do an intermission, but we didn't mention this at the top.

27:36.080 --> 27:40.080
We're going to do an intermission here in a little bit, and when we come back, we're going to do your questions.

27:40.080 --> 27:50.080
Go ahead and email us at, what is it? Live at bim-bam.com. During intermission, go buy pins of our face and a misprinted poster.

27:50.080 --> 27:56.080
Oh, Travis, I'm sure. Yeah, by the way, there will be W's for sale that you can just glue on there. They'll be $18.

27:56.080 --> 28:04.080
We need to explain it because this place is called the Warfield. It's beautiful. It's lovely. Thank you to the Warfield.

28:04.080 --> 28:14.080
It may be the situation that Paul, our beloved tour manager's computer, autocorrected that to another word.

28:14.080 --> 28:20.080
That other word could be an orange cat who gets up to no good sometimes.

28:20.080 --> 28:26.080
Here's the thing. Let me tell you right now. The Warfield loves Mondays, hates lasagna.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.080
True. It's a different thing.

28:28.080 --> 28:36.080
This will be Paul's last show with us. If you would all join me in saying goodbye, Paul.

28:36.080 --> 28:38.080
Goodbye, Paul. Bon voyage.

28:38.080 --> 28:42.080
Paul, can you come out real quick? Just a quick bow. Thanks for all the hard work, Paul.

28:42.080 --> 28:44.080
Paul's last show.

28:46.080 --> 28:50.080
Go ahead and settle up now. There's your five bucks.

28:50.080 --> 28:52.080
Yeah, we do need change.

28:52.080 --> 28:56.080
Change from that. Thank you, Paul. Perfect. Thank you, Paul.

28:56.080 --> 28:58.080
Paul Seborn, everybody.

28:58.080 --> 29:02.080
Paul Seborn. He'll never work in this town again.

29:02.080 --> 29:06.080
If any of you out there would like to be Paul, make sure you drop us a line.

29:06.080 --> 29:08.080
We'll be holding Paul auditions tomorrow.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.080
We'll be holding Paul auditions.

29:10.080 --> 29:16.080
Can we do one more? I think we can solve this one really quickly.

29:16.080 --> 29:18.080
Sure, sure.

29:18.080 --> 29:22.080
I've been playing Dance Dance Revolution competitively for more than 15 years.

29:22.080 --> 29:24.080
Fuck yes.

29:24.080 --> 29:28.080
The newest version is only available near me at an arcade slash sports bar establishment.

29:28.080 --> 29:30.080
Dave and Buster's.

29:30.080 --> 29:32.080
Does it say that?

29:32.080 --> 29:34.080
In parentheses it says Dave and Buster's.

29:34.080 --> 29:36.080
Just say fucking Dave and Buster's.

29:36.080 --> 29:38.080
It's the little mom and pop local joint.

29:38.080 --> 29:42.080
It's owned by my friends Dave and Buster.

29:42.080 --> 29:46.080
So often there will be drunk dude bros who mock me while I'm playing.

29:46.080 --> 29:50.080
Or will jump around on the other pad while I'm trying to focus on the game.

29:50.080 --> 30:00.080
How do I deal with these jerks who are distracting and taunting me when I'm just trying to get some exercise and improve my scores?

30:00.080 --> 30:06.080
That's from Distracted Dancer in... Daily City?

30:06.080 --> 30:10.080
Are you here?

30:10.080 --> 30:16.080
Why the fuck are you all sitting so close?

30:16.080 --> 30:24.080
Here's the thing Justin, until we made the joke about the mom and pop thing, I never thought maybe these dude bros are Dave Jr. and Buster Jr.

30:24.080 --> 30:26.080
Shit.

30:26.080 --> 30:28.080
This is my dad's place.

30:28.080 --> 30:32.080
This is my dad's place. They said I could hassle whoever I want.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.080
And I chose you.

30:34.080 --> 30:36.080
What are they doing there?

30:36.080 --> 30:42.080
What are the dude bros doing that they think they're so cool and high and mighty and above DDR but they're still at Dave and Buster's?

30:42.080 --> 30:44.080
Sure.

30:44.080 --> 30:46.080
They're also here?

30:46.080 --> 30:48.080
Yeah.

30:48.080 --> 30:52.080
It's like opening your eyes when you pray and you see someone else opening their eyes and you're like, gotcha.

30:52.080 --> 30:54.080
It's like, no idiot.

30:54.080 --> 30:56.080
You're opening your eyes too.

30:56.080 --> 31:00.080
You didn't accidentally go to Dave and Buster's because you read about the food on Yelp.

31:00.080 --> 31:04.080
And you got there like, oh it turns out they have video games here too.

31:04.080 --> 31:08.080
I love sweet potatoes and I love when they're made into fries.

31:08.080 --> 31:10.080
Don't mind if I do.

31:10.080 --> 31:12.080
Here's what you do, you go to every fucking golden tea machine in that place.

31:12.080 --> 31:14.080
The jock games.

31:14.080 --> 31:16.080
The jock games.

31:16.080 --> 31:18.080
Like golden tea golf.

31:18.080 --> 31:20.080
Go to all the golden tea, go to all the hunting games.

31:20.080 --> 31:22.080
You get a jar of jelly.

31:22.080 --> 31:26.080
You put the jelly on the golden tea roller ball.

31:26.080 --> 31:28.080
Oh, dude.

31:28.080 --> 31:32.080
I'm going to top my best score in golden tea.

31:32.080 --> 31:34.080
Oh no.

31:34.080 --> 31:36.080
I got jelly all over my ding-dang hair.

31:36.080 --> 31:40.080
What's great about that one is if they still touch it, you take a picture of it, put it on Facebook.

31:40.080 --> 31:44.080
And you say, look at these perverts touching the jelly ball.

31:44.080 --> 31:48.080
Upload that to nastyboys.tumblr.com.

31:48.080 --> 31:52.080
Also, they're not going to be able to get the traction they need for all their great chickens.

31:52.080 --> 31:54.080
They go to roll and it sticks.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.080
Oh no, the ball rolls backwards.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.080
And they're like, look at these amateurs.

31:58.080 --> 32:00.080
And then you make fun of them.

32:00.080 --> 32:02.080
They're not going to have any reason to want to stick around to Dave and Buster's.

32:02.080 --> 32:04.080
Hey, let's go guys.

32:04.080 --> 32:06.080
All the machines here have jelly on them.

32:06.080 --> 32:08.080
Let's scram, T-birds.

32:08.080 --> 32:10.080
And they walk out snapping.

32:10.080 --> 32:12.080
Let's go, guys.

32:12.080 --> 32:14.080
This place is the pits.

32:18.080 --> 32:20.080
All right, folks, that's going to do it for us.

32:20.080 --> 32:22.080
We will be back with you. Email us your questions.

32:22.080 --> 32:24.080
And we will help you through all of it.

32:24.080 --> 32:26.080
We love you. Buy some things. Get some pee done.

32:26.080 --> 32:28.080
And we will see you in a few minutes.

32:28.080 --> 32:40.080
We love you.

32:40.080 --> 32:42.080
Hey everybody, it's Griffin and Travis.

32:42.080 --> 32:44.080
Justin's not here because he fell in a big toilet.

32:44.080 --> 32:46.080
But we're going to tell you all about our sponsors this week.

32:46.080 --> 32:48.080
No bullshit. No guff.

32:48.080 --> 32:50.080
And don't worry about Justin.

32:50.080 --> 32:52.080
He's fine. He's just in the toilet.

32:52.080 --> 32:54.080
Yeah, he said he texted us.

32:54.080 --> 32:56.080
He said, I fell in the toilet. Please send 911.

32:56.080 --> 32:58.080
And he said, are you serious, dog?

32:58.080 --> 33:00.080
And he said, never mind. It's totally cool in here.

33:00.080 --> 33:02.080
So I guess he found some friends.

33:02.080 --> 33:04.080
Sort of a whole labyrinth situation.

33:04.080 --> 33:06.080
But damn it, Travis, I said no bullshit.

33:06.080 --> 33:08.080
No guff.

33:08.080 --> 33:10.080
Okay, sorry. Go on.

33:10.080 --> 33:12.080
Tell me about Squarespace as quickly as you possibly can

33:12.080 --> 33:14.080
while being respectful of the fact that Squarespace paid us to talk about them.

33:14.080 --> 33:16.080
Okay, here's the thing.

33:16.080 --> 33:18.080
I love Squarespace very much.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.080
In this day and age, everybody's got...

33:20.080 --> 33:22.080
Well, why didn't you marry it?

33:22.080 --> 33:24.080
I have.

33:24.080 --> 33:26.080
Well, I was kind of building up to it,

33:26.080 --> 33:28.080
but the word is out.

33:28.080 --> 33:30.080
Yeah, congratulations, I guess.

33:30.080 --> 33:32.080
Thank you very much.

33:32.080 --> 33:34.080
I made a website on Squarespace,

33:34.080 --> 33:36.080
which is what I consider marriage.

33:36.080 --> 33:38.080
Oh, okay.

33:38.080 --> 33:40.080
And it's called McRoyShows.com,

33:40.080 --> 33:42.080
and it was incredibly easy to make.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.080
Squarespace is so intuitive,

33:44.080 --> 33:46.080
and you don't have to know anything about coding.

33:46.080 --> 33:48.080
You don't have to know anything about making a website.

33:48.080 --> 33:50.080
You just go to Squarespace.

33:50.080 --> 33:52.080
You're like, I want to do this,

33:52.080 --> 33:54.080
and it's really easy, it's super great.

33:54.080 --> 33:56.080
They have beautiful templates,

33:56.080 --> 33:58.080
and they have powerful e-commerce functionality,

33:58.080 --> 34:00.080
so you can sell things on your website.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.080
It's free and secure hosting,

34:02.080 --> 34:04.080
and there's nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

34:04.080 --> 34:06.080
So how do I get this dang thing?

34:06.080 --> 34:08.080
Well, you head to squarespace.com slash mybrother

34:08.080 --> 34:10.080
for a free trial,

34:10.080 --> 34:12.080
and when you're ready to launch, you use the offer code

34:12.080 --> 34:14.080
mybrother, all one word,

34:14.080 --> 34:16.080
to save 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain.

34:16.080 --> 34:18.080
That's squarespace.com slash mybrother

34:18.080 --> 34:20.080
and then enter the code

34:20.080 --> 34:22.080
mybrother, all one word, mybrother.

34:22.080 --> 34:24.080
Travis mentioned McElroy Shows.

34:24.080 --> 34:26.080
Quick plug, go to McElroyShows.com slash tours.

34:26.080 --> 34:28.080
Travis has updated it with a bunch of stuff.

34:28.080 --> 34:30.080
All of our upcoming announced shows

34:30.080 --> 34:32.080
from Bim Bam and Taz,

34:32.080 --> 34:34.080
including some Bim Bam shows in Orlando and Atlanta

34:34.080 --> 34:36.080
coming up later this summer.

34:36.080 --> 34:38.080
We got links to the book tour that we're doing

34:38.080 --> 34:40.080
for the Taz graphic novel in July.

34:40.080 --> 34:42.080
I think there's still some tickets available.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.080
It'll be fun. It'll be like a Q&A

34:44.080 --> 34:46.080
and a little reading of parts of the book,

34:46.080 --> 34:48.080
and your ticket covers the price of a graphic novel.

34:48.080 --> 34:50.080
And then, Travis, you got tickets for,

34:50.080 --> 34:52.080
oh, we're also doing some book signing events

34:52.080 --> 34:54.080
that just got added there. You can find it, all that.

34:54.080 --> 34:56.080
And, Travis, you have tickets for

34:56.080 --> 34:58.080
the next CUS that's coming up very soon, right?

34:58.080 --> 35:00.080
Yes, so this Sunday,

35:00.080 --> 35:02.080
Sunday the 24th, June 24th,

35:02.080 --> 35:04.080
at 8pm, we're doing another

35:04.080 --> 35:06.080
Cincinnati Underground Society Show,

35:06.080 --> 35:08.080
which is my Secret Society

35:08.080 --> 35:10.080
style comedy show.

35:10.080 --> 35:12.080
I've brought in five amazing surprise

35:12.080 --> 35:14.080
guests that I cannot tell you now, but I can

35:14.080 --> 35:16.080
tell you they're some of my favorite people in the world.

35:16.080 --> 35:18.080
It's going to be a hell of a good time.

35:18.080 --> 35:20.080
$15. It's a comedy show,

35:20.080 --> 35:22.080
but it's got a whole

35:22.080 --> 35:24.080
Secret Society veneer.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.080
It's really fun. It's one of my favorite

35:26.080 --> 35:28.080
things I get to do now, and

35:28.080 --> 35:30.080
I want you to come and have a great time

35:30.080 --> 35:32.080
in Cincinnati, Ohio, June 24th,

35:32.080 --> 35:34.080
8pm. You can find that on

35:34.080 --> 35:36.080
McRoyShows.com, or you can go to

35:36.080 --> 35:38.080
bit.ly

35:38.080 --> 35:40.080
slash CUS June

35:40.080 --> 35:42.080
2018. Bit.ly

35:42.080 --> 35:44.080
slash CUS June

35:44.080 --> 35:46.080
2018. I want to tell you about

35:46.080 --> 35:48.080
Stamps.com. Stamps.com is the

35:48.080 --> 35:50.080
best, because these days you can

35:50.080 --> 35:52.080
get pretty much anything on demand, like our

35:52.080 --> 35:54.080
podcast, which you listen to whenever

35:54.080 --> 35:56.080
you want, whenever it's convenient for you,

35:56.080 --> 35:58.080
or whenever we make unreasonable demands

35:58.080 --> 36:00.080
of you. But

36:00.080 --> 36:02.080
Stamps.com can do the same thing for

36:02.080 --> 36:04.080
you, but for Stamps. You don't have to

36:04.080 --> 36:06.080
take a trip to the post office to mail your letters

36:06.080 --> 36:08.080
and your packages. You can get your postage

36:08.080 --> 36:10.080
on demand with Stamps.com.

36:10.080 --> 36:12.080
Ah, Stamps. I was

36:12.080 --> 36:14.080
misreading it the whole time. With Stamps.com

36:14.080 --> 36:16.080
you can access all the amazing services

36:16.080 --> 36:18.080
of the post office right from your desk 24-7.

36:18.080 --> 36:20.080
You can buy and print official U.S. postage

36:20.080 --> 36:22.080
for any letter, any package, using your own

36:22.080 --> 36:24.080
computer and printer. This is very

36:24.080 --> 36:26.080
convenient for me. Me and Rachel recently

36:26.080 --> 36:28.080
moved. Now we're a bit further away from the

36:28.080 --> 36:30.080
post office that we use.

36:30.080 --> 36:32.080
And now I can just do all this shit at home from my

36:32.080 --> 36:34.080
desk and not have to go to the scary outside

36:34.080 --> 36:36.080
my house. Right now you can use

36:36.080 --> 36:38.080
MyBrother, the code MyBrother, for this special

36:38.080 --> 36:40.080
offer. It includes up to $55 free

36:40.080 --> 36:42.080
postage, a digital scale, and a 4-week

36:42.080 --> 36:44.080
trial. Don't wait! Go to Stamps.com

36:44.080 --> 36:46.080
before you do anything else. Click on the radio

36:46.080 --> 36:48.080
microphone at the top of the home page and type in

36:48.080 --> 36:50.080
MyBrother, all one word. That's Stamps.com

36:50.080 --> 36:52.080
Enter MyBrother. Travis,

36:52.080 --> 36:54.080
this Jumbotron. What's the fuckin' deal?

36:54.080 --> 36:56.080
Well, Griffin,

36:56.080 --> 36:58.080
thank you for asking. This is for

36:58.080 --> 37:00.080
Craig from

37:00.080 --> 37:02.080
Mike, if you can

37:02.080 --> 37:04.080
believe it. I don't...

37:04.080 --> 37:06.080
It's out of this world. And Mike says

37:06.080 --> 37:08.080
to Craig,

37:08.080 --> 37:10.080
I know there's nothing you want more in life

37:10.080 --> 37:12.080
than the McRoy's congratulating you on getting married.

37:12.080 --> 37:14.080
So I bought a Jumbotron so they can

37:14.080 --> 37:16.080
tell you how happy they are for you.

37:16.080 --> 37:18.080
Congratulations, Craig!

37:18.080 --> 37:20.080
We're so happy you found someone as great

37:20.080 --> 37:22.080
as Sosi to spend your

37:22.080 --> 37:24.080
life with. We hope you have

37:24.080 --> 37:26.080
a great wedding day and a great

37:26.080 --> 37:28.080
weekend in Boulder. I do love,

37:28.080 --> 37:30.080
I noticed here, that what Mike has

37:30.080 --> 37:32.080
done switched from

37:32.080 --> 37:34.080
I to we

37:34.080 --> 37:36.080
to make it seem like we,

37:36.080 --> 37:38.080
the McRoy brothers, are saying this.

37:38.080 --> 37:40.080
That's bullshit,

37:40.080 --> 37:42.080
Craig. Don't fall for it. Mike wrote

37:42.080 --> 37:44.080
that. I was just reading it.

37:44.080 --> 37:46.080
This is a trick. I mean, I am...

37:46.080 --> 37:48.080
It's a trick. I am

37:48.080 --> 37:50.080
psyched out of my mind, though.

37:50.080 --> 37:52.080
Fuckin' losing it. And I hope

37:52.080 --> 37:54.080
you have a great wedding day. And has anybody

37:54.080 --> 37:56.080
ever had a bad weekend in Boulder?

37:56.080 --> 37:58.080
Probably. Yeah,

37:58.080 --> 38:00.080
probably. It's the city and people going through

38:00.080 --> 38:02.080
a lot of stuff everywhere. I got a message here for

38:02.080 --> 38:04.080
John and it's from Mark who says, Thanks for

38:04.080 --> 38:06.080
being such a great friend. I'm sad that you are going

38:06.080 --> 38:08.080
to be moving away or have already moved.

38:08.080 --> 38:10.080
I had to write this message way before a date was

38:10.080 --> 38:12.080
set. I either miss you or I'm going to miss

38:12.080 --> 38:14.080
you. Who knows what's already happened by the time

38:14.080 --> 38:16.080
you hear this. Happy birthday wherever you

38:16.080 --> 38:18.080
are, whether you're in Phoenix, Milwaukee,

38:18.080 --> 38:20.080
or anywhere else.

38:20.080 --> 38:22.080
This is one of the more abstract messages

38:22.080 --> 38:24.080
that we've ever had on the show, which

38:24.080 --> 38:26.080
is sort of the nature of the Jumbotron.

38:26.080 --> 38:28.080
It's applicable,

38:28.080 --> 38:30.080
I guess, to all

38:30.080 --> 38:32.080
Johns, wherever you are, whatever your

38:32.080 --> 38:34.080
heart is telling you tonight,

38:34.080 --> 38:36.080
if you feel your heart telling you something, why don't

38:36.080 --> 38:38.080
you come on down and talk to us

38:38.080 --> 38:40.080
about Jesus. That one

38:40.080 --> 38:42.080
got a little twisted up

38:42.080 --> 38:44.080
a little bit. Hey, what's

38:44.080 --> 38:46.080
up with this last Jumbotron? Yeah,

38:46.080 --> 38:48.080
we got one last one here. I'm going to shoot

38:48.080 --> 38:50.080
straight from the hip with this one. Say it's from

38:50.080 --> 38:52.080
Shelby to Jordan.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.080
Happy birthday, JoJo.

38:54.080 --> 38:56.080
Thank you for being the best

38:56.080 --> 38:58.080
husband, D&D partner,

38:58.080 --> 39:00.080
and all around hard worker boy.

39:00.080 --> 39:02.080
It's been amazing to watch you grow

39:02.080 --> 39:04.080
into the person you are today. You

39:04.080 --> 39:06.080
are my inspiration.

39:06.080 --> 39:08.080
I love you the

39:08.080 --> 39:10.080
mostest. I love

39:10.080 --> 39:12.080
this one. It doesn't make us say a bunch of bullshit.

39:12.080 --> 39:14.080
Doesn't hijack our

39:14.080 --> 39:16.080
brains, mouths, and voices. It's just

39:16.080 --> 39:18.080
a message about a sweet love.

39:18.080 --> 39:20.080
A good, sweet love.

39:20.080 --> 39:22.080
Yeah, this isn't like a funny like,

39:22.080 --> 39:24.080
I'm going to make Griffin say doody noodles

39:24.080 --> 39:26.080
with his mouth or whatever. This is

39:26.080 --> 39:28.080
just like, hey, JoJo.

39:28.080 --> 39:30.080
You're great. Just

39:30.080 --> 39:32.080
stand and deliver that good,

39:32.080 --> 39:34.080
sweet, sweet love.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.080
That's it for the

39:36.080 --> 39:38.080
Jumbotrons. We're going to get back to the

39:38.080 --> 39:40.080
rest of the episode. If you're in San Francisco,

39:40.080 --> 39:42.080
hope you had a good time, and we'll be back

39:42.080 --> 39:44.080
with another regular episode next Monday.

39:44.080 --> 39:46.080
We'll see you then.

39:46.080 --> 39:48.080
Don't forget to check out macroshows.com

39:48.080 --> 39:50.080
slash tours. Yes,

39:50.080 --> 39:52.080
do it. Then we'll see you

39:52.080 --> 39:58.080
then. Bye.

40:22.080 --> 40:24.080
Okay, so

40:24.080 --> 40:26.080
I guess let's just get

40:26.080 --> 40:54.080
I'm having some interference.

40:54.080 --> 41:10.080
Time.

41:10.080 --> 41:12.080
He's got it.

41:12.080 --> 41:20.080
That sound I've been looking for.

41:20.080 --> 41:22.080
Still going.

41:22.080 --> 41:32.080
I want a much.

41:32.080 --> 41:34.080
Welcome to Munch Squad.

41:34.080 --> 41:38.080
I was

41:38.080 --> 41:40.080
within a podcast.

41:40.080 --> 41:42.080
Let me finish. It's a podcast

41:42.080 --> 41:44.080
within a podcast about

41:44.080 --> 41:46.080
ladies grace in quick service restaurant

41:46.080 --> 41:48.080
innovations. My name is Justin

41:48.080 --> 41:50.080
McElroy, and I'll be your host this week.

41:50.080 --> 41:52.080
It's the first

41:52.080 --> 41:54.080
time that the audience interaction part

41:54.080 --> 42:02.080
of that has hurt my ears.

42:02.080 --> 42:06.080
It's not pleasant.

42:06.080 --> 42:10.080
Paul, that was a generous pour.

42:10.080 --> 42:12.080
Whenever you get, if you find some Diet Coke

42:12.080 --> 42:14.080
back there, you go ahead on

42:14.080 --> 42:16.080
and just hit me with that because we're going to need to

42:16.080 --> 42:18.080
slow things on down.

42:18.080 --> 42:20.080
We're going to make it to the end of the show.

42:20.080 --> 42:24.080
Munch Squad.

42:24.080 --> 42:26.080
Don't let

42:26.080 --> 42:28.080
bad potholes ruin

42:28.080 --> 42:30.080
good pizza.

42:30.080 --> 42:32.080
Domino's

42:32.080 --> 42:34.080
starts paving for

42:34.080 --> 42:36.080
pizza.

42:36.080 --> 42:38.080
Can I ask you a question right at the

42:38.080 --> 42:40.080
beginning of the premise? Yes.

42:40.080 --> 42:42.080
Go ahead.

42:42.080 --> 42:44.080
Have potholes ruined good

42:44.080 --> 42:46.080
pizza before this?

42:46.080 --> 42:48.080
Yeah, you fucking idiot.

42:48.080 --> 42:50.080
They were

42:50.080 --> 42:52.080
one of the

42:52.080 --> 42:54.080
main weapons

42:54.080 --> 42:56.080
that he used in his fight.

42:56.080 --> 42:58.080
I need everyone to

42:58.080 --> 43:00.080
spiritually brace themselves. It'll

43:00.080 --> 43:02.080
help if you've seen Handmaid's Tale, I think.

43:02.080 --> 43:04.080
I haven't

43:04.080 --> 43:06.080
seen it, but I'm assuming.

43:06.080 --> 43:08.080
It's about this.

43:08.080 --> 43:10.080
The largest

43:10.080 --> 43:12.080
pizza company in the world

43:12.080 --> 43:14.080
based on global retail

43:14.080 --> 43:16.080
sales, which seems like a good metric

43:16.080 --> 43:18.080
for that. No need to

43:18.080 --> 43:20.080
specify. Really? Is saving

43:20.080 --> 43:22.080
pizza one pothole

43:22.080 --> 43:24.080
at a time.

43:24.080 --> 43:26.080
Cracks, bumps, potholes,

43:26.080 --> 43:28.080
and other road conditions

43:28.080 --> 43:30.080
can put good pizzas at risk after

43:30.080 --> 43:32.080
they leave the store.

43:32.080 --> 43:34.080
Now Domino's is helping

43:34.080 --> 43:36.080
to smooth the ride home for our

43:36.080 --> 43:38.080
freshly made pizzas.

43:38.080 --> 43:40.080
Starting today, Domino's is

43:40.080 --> 43:42.080
asking customers to nominate their town

43:42.080 --> 43:44.080
for pothole repairs at pavingforpizza.com.

43:48.080 --> 43:50.080
Are they filling these

43:50.080 --> 43:52.080
things in with cheese bread

43:52.080 --> 43:54.080
sauce, pepperonis?

43:54.080 --> 43:56.080
No. As much as it may feel like cement

43:56.080 --> 43:58.080
once it's entered your body, no.

43:58.080 --> 44:00.080
They're using actual cement.

44:00.080 --> 44:02.080

44:02.080 --> 44:04.080
Weiner, president of Domino's

44:04.080 --> 44:06.080
USA. They got

44:06.080 --> 44:08.080
Russell for this one.

44:08.080 --> 44:10.080
The president of Domino's.

44:10.080 --> 44:12.080
Have you ever hit a pothole

44:12.080 --> 44:14.080
and instantly cringed?

44:14.080 --> 44:16.080
We know that feeling is

44:16.080 --> 44:18.080
heightened when you're bringing home a

44:18.080 --> 44:20.080
carry out order from your local Domino's

44:20.080 --> 44:22.080
store. I got my

44:22.080 --> 44:24.080
kid in the back seat, but I'm way more concerned

44:24.080 --> 44:26.080
about the 12 inch

44:26.080 --> 44:28.080
sausage. I have

44:28.080 --> 44:30.080
an automatic thing on my

44:30.080 --> 44:32.080
passenger seat where if the passenger is sitting there

44:32.080 --> 44:34.080
it reminds you to buckle their seatbelt.

44:34.080 --> 44:36.080
And a few weeks ago I bought enough

44:36.080 --> 44:38.080
pizza that it activated that.

44:38.080 --> 44:40.080
And in

44:40.080 --> 44:42.080
my car's defense

44:42.080 --> 44:44.080
I paid a lot for that

44:44.080 --> 44:46.080
pizza. I probably should buckle it in.

44:46.080 --> 44:48.080
Fair enough.

44:48.080 --> 44:50.080
Fair enough, car.

44:50.080 --> 44:52.080
We don't want to lose any

44:52.080 --> 44:54.080
great tasting pizza to a pothole

44:54.080 --> 44:56.080
ruining a wonderful meal.

44:56.080 --> 44:58.080
Said Russell Weiner, president

44:58.080 --> 45:00.080
of Domino's USA.

45:00.080 --> 45:02.080
How bad does a pothole have to fuck

45:02.080 --> 45:04.080
up your pizza that you throw it away?

45:04.080 --> 45:06.080
You hit the pothole, the pizza

45:06.080 --> 45:08.080
flips end over end

45:08.080 --> 45:10.080
because you live in Roger Rabbit.

45:10.080 --> 45:12.080
But okay, it might affect the pizza aesthetically

45:12.080 --> 45:14.080
but you can still

45:14.080 --> 45:16.080
consume it. Daniel Tiger says that

45:16.080 --> 45:18.080
even if it's mushy it still tastes good.

45:18.080 --> 45:20.080
Right. Domino's cares too

45:20.080 --> 45:22.080
much about its customers and pizza

45:22.080 --> 45:24.080
to let that happen. That is not true.

45:28.080 --> 45:30.080
If they care about me

45:30.080 --> 45:32.080
they have a funny way of showing

45:32.080 --> 45:34.080
it.

45:34.080 --> 45:36.080
Domino's has already worked alongside

45:36.080 --> 45:38.080
four municipalities to help prepare roads.

45:38.080 --> 45:40.080
Jesus Christ!

45:40.080 --> 45:42.080
Those include Bartonville, Texas

45:42.080 --> 45:44.080
Milford, Delaware, Athens, Georgia,

45:44.080 --> 45:46.080
and Burbank, California.

45:46.080 --> 45:48.080
Customers

45:48.080 --> 45:50.080
interested in nominating their town

45:50.080 --> 45:52.080
for a paving grant from Domino's

45:56.080 --> 45:58.080
can enter the zip code at pavingforpizza.com

45:58.080 --> 46:00.080
If their

46:00.080 --> 46:02.080
town is selected their customer will be

46:02.080 --> 46:04.080
notified and the city will receive funds

46:04.080 --> 46:06.080
to help prepare roads so pizzas

46:06.080 --> 46:08.080
can make it home safely.

46:08.080 --> 46:10.080
Customers

46:10.080 --> 46:12.080
can celebrate smooth roads

46:12.080 --> 46:14.080
with Domino's carryout special

46:14.080 --> 46:16.080
featuring large three topping pizzas

46:16.080 --> 46:18.080
for $7. Okay.

46:18.080 --> 46:20.080
It's 2018

46:20.080 --> 46:22.080
and

46:22.080 --> 46:24.080
this is where we're at. Yeah.

46:24.080 --> 46:26.080
Our infrastructure

46:26.080 --> 46:28.080
relies on Domino's.

46:28.080 --> 46:30.080
You know how

46:30.080 --> 46:32.080
like the

46:32.080 --> 46:34.080
final season of Lost

46:34.080 --> 46:36.080
took some

46:36.080 --> 46:38.080
weird twists and turns

46:38.080 --> 46:40.080
and that happened on a lot of shows like

46:40.080 --> 46:42.080
Felicity.

46:42.080 --> 46:44.080
Original

46:44.080 --> 46:46.080
probably only

46:46.080 --> 46:48.080
just kind of racist

46:48.080 --> 46:50.080
Roseanne.

46:50.080 --> 46:52.080
Weird twists and turns.

46:52.080 --> 46:54.080
I feel like here

46:54.080 --> 46:56.080
in the final season of Capitalism

46:56.080 --> 46:58.080
we're getting some like weird

46:58.080 --> 47:00.080
like whoa.

47:04.080 --> 47:06.080
Yeah. Like you all know that

47:06.080 --> 47:08.080
like there's a point at which Domino's is

47:08.080 --> 47:10.080
like we fixed all the

47:10.080 --> 47:12.080
roads we should probably govern.

47:12.080 --> 47:14.080
Yeah. Don't you

47:14.080 --> 47:16.080
think that we did a better job than your

47:16.080 --> 47:18.080
city. Do you want to just be a

47:18.080 --> 47:20.080
Domino's city.

47:20.080 --> 47:22.080
So you have to decide whether

47:22.080 --> 47:24.080
or not you want to vote Republican or

47:24.080 --> 47:26.080
pizza crap.

47:26.080 --> 47:28.080
And Taco Bell is like we

47:28.080 --> 47:30.080
could open up a traffic court if you

47:30.080 --> 47:32.080
guys want that. Would that

47:32.080 --> 47:34.080
be cool.

47:34.080 --> 47:36.080
The wheels are just way off

47:36.080 --> 47:38.080
the thing at this point. The thing is that

47:38.080 --> 47:40.080
the wheels are off but they're

47:40.080 --> 47:42.080
not because they fixed the bottles.

47:42.080 --> 47:44.080
Thank you Travis. Okay so

47:44.080 --> 47:46.080
we are going to.

47:48.080 --> 47:50.080
Thank you Paul.

47:50.080 --> 47:52.080
Thank you.

47:52.080 --> 47:54.080
Thank you. Paul you've saved

47:54.080 --> 47:56.080
the show. You're back on.

47:56.080 --> 47:58.080
Yay. Welcome back Paul Saborin.

48:00.080 --> 48:02.080
All right. You saved the rec center.

48:02.080 --> 48:04.080
Yeah that's good Paul. That's real good.

48:04.080 --> 48:06.080
Can we get some house lights up

48:06.080 --> 48:08.080
because I have no fucking clue where the

48:08.080 --> 48:10.080
microphone is in the audience.

48:10.080 --> 48:12.080
If you would like to give us your pronouns

48:12.080 --> 48:14.080
we would of course welcome that. Do not goof

48:14.080 --> 48:16.080
about it though because you will be ejected from the theater.

48:16.080 --> 48:18.080
Sarah. The

48:18.080 --> 48:20.080
sentence that Sarah sent us was

48:20.080 --> 48:22.080
to say the least

48:22.080 --> 48:24.080
tantalizing.

48:24.080 --> 48:26.080
Sarah asked how do I

48:26.080 --> 48:28.080
get my friends to stop using their

48:28.080 --> 48:30.080
dog's dick to promote their furniture

48:30.080 --> 48:32.080
line.

48:32.080 --> 48:34.080
And all I can

48:34.080 --> 48:36.080
say is go off. Yes.

48:36.080 --> 48:38.080
Sarah

48:38.080 --> 48:40.080
has stepped 30 feet away from the microphone

48:40.080 --> 48:42.080
recoiling. She did not

48:42.080 --> 48:44.080
think this was going to make it. I did not.

48:44.080 --> 48:46.080
And yet here we all are

48:46.080 --> 48:48.080
Sarah. You did walk down to the

48:48.080 --> 48:50.080
microphone Sarah. Kind of a fun

48:50.080 --> 48:52.080
cautionary tale for everyone.

48:52.080 --> 48:54.080
My friend volunteered

48:54.080 --> 48:56.080
to come for me and I wish I had let

48:56.080 --> 48:58.080
her do that. Oh my god so much happened in

48:58.080 --> 49:00.080
the span of just a few seconds. Yeah and it's also

49:00.080 --> 49:02.080
worth noting that we called three people

49:02.080 --> 49:04.080
a few minutes ago and only two have come down.

49:04.080 --> 49:06.080
So one of those people is like actually fuck

49:06.080 --> 49:08.080
that.

49:08.080 --> 49:10.080
No way. They're sitting on the stairs.

49:10.080 --> 49:12.080
Sarah.

49:12.080 --> 49:14.080
Dog dick furniture

49:14.080 --> 49:16.080
line. Curious how that's germane

49:16.080 --> 49:18.080
even a little bit. Is it tied in? Is it a

49:18.080 --> 49:20.080
celebrity endorsement?

49:20.080 --> 49:22.080
A famous dog Taco Bell dog.

49:22.080 --> 49:24.080
Spud's McKenzie showing his dick.

49:24.080 --> 49:26.080
So I

49:26.080 --> 49:28.080
have some friends of some friends who

49:28.080 --> 49:30.080
have a furniture store

49:30.080 --> 49:32.080
and they constantly

49:32.080 --> 49:34.080
promote their furniture with their two

49:34.080 --> 49:36.080
dogs that are very cute

49:36.080 --> 49:38.080
on Instagram. Yes. OK.

49:38.080 --> 49:40.080
And they always

49:40.080 --> 49:42.080
like zoom in on their

49:42.080 --> 49:44.080
dogs dick. They do

49:44.080 --> 49:46.080
or you do?

49:46.080 --> 49:48.080
So

49:48.080 --> 49:50.080
as you're scrolling it's like five pictures.

49:50.080 --> 49:52.080
Oh cute dogs. Oh it's closer.

49:52.080 --> 49:54.080
Cute furniture. Oh there's a

49:54.080 --> 49:56.080
dog's dick and they highlight it

49:56.080 --> 49:58.080
by using the lipstick emoji.

49:58.080 --> 50:00.080
No.

50:00.080 --> 50:02.080
No.

50:02.080 --> 50:04.080
So it's not on accident.

50:04.080 --> 50:06.080
It's not. It's very

50:06.080 --> 50:08.080
on purpose. Well maybe they're

50:08.080 --> 50:10.080
showing that their couches are

50:10.080 --> 50:12.080
lipstick proof.

50:12.080 --> 50:14.080
No it's probably

50:14.080 --> 50:16.080
the dick.

50:16.080 --> 50:18.080
Why? Well why? Did you ever

50:18.080 --> 50:20.080
ask? Hey Sarah why? Sarah why though?

50:20.080 --> 50:22.080
Well no. No.

50:22.080 --> 50:24.080
I don't know. I need to

50:24.080 --> 50:26.080
communicate to them that this is

50:26.080 --> 50:28.080
horrifying and haunts my dreams. Yeah

50:28.080 --> 50:30.080
haunts the dreams but what's the name of

50:30.080 --> 50:32.080
the store? No. No. No.

50:32.080 --> 50:34.080
No.

50:34.080 --> 50:36.080
They would hate it if they got any advertising

50:36.080 --> 50:38.080
for their thing that didn't involve

50:38.080 --> 50:40.080
a dog penis

50:40.080 --> 50:42.080
in it. They use a lipstick

50:42.080 --> 50:44.080
emoji so they might like it. It's

50:44.080 --> 50:46.080
Fresh Kills there in Brooklyn. Okay.

50:46.080 --> 50:48.080
Okay. So.

50:48.080 --> 50:50.080
We'll edit that out.

50:50.080 --> 50:52.080
Here's the thing I'll say. It's working.

50:52.080 --> 50:54.080
Yeah you're talking about it on our

50:54.080 --> 50:56.080
podcast right now. You can't stop thinking

50:56.080 --> 50:58.080
about these dog dicks on the

50:58.080 --> 51:00.080
Shays Lounge. Here's the thing

51:00.080 --> 51:02.080
Sarah. What you are in right now is a circumstance.

51:02.080 --> 51:04.080
You can't say to them like

51:04.080 --> 51:06.080
hey your dog's

51:06.080 --> 51:08.080
penis is present in there. Because they're

51:08.080 --> 51:10.080
going to say yeah.

51:10.080 --> 51:12.080
There's nothing wrong with it

51:12.080 --> 51:14.080
I guess. But it's the

51:14.080 --> 51:16.080
it's the

51:16.080 --> 51:18.080
We don't. We're

51:18.080 --> 51:20.080
not here to mutt shame.

51:20.080 --> 51:22.080
Yeah. Jeez.

51:22.080 --> 51:24.080
Come on it's something.

51:24.080 --> 51:26.080
Come on. I'm not safe

51:26.080 --> 51:28.080
anywhere at this table. I'm doing my

51:28.080 --> 51:30.080
best up here. She probably made a very

51:30.080 --> 51:32.080
strong drink.

51:32.080 --> 51:34.080
How do I.

51:34.080 --> 51:36.080
Dog got it.

51:36.080 --> 51:38.080
How do you convince them not to

51:38.080 --> 51:40.080
do it. Here's

51:40.080 --> 51:42.080
the Schrodinger's box of this situation.

51:42.080 --> 51:44.080
If you had gone

51:44.080 --> 51:46.080
to them and talked to them about this

51:46.080 --> 51:48.080
they may have changed it. The fact

51:48.080 --> 51:50.080
that you've come on this podcast now and

51:50.080 --> 51:52.080
made it observed

51:52.080 --> 51:54.080
and promoted

51:54.080 --> 51:56.080
their brand on our show

51:56.080 --> 51:58.080
means they will never change it.

51:58.080 --> 52:00.080
It's working.

52:00.080 --> 52:02.080
The hard truth of the matter. Let me offer

52:02.080 --> 52:04.080
an option. If you

52:04.080 --> 52:06.080
If you

52:06.080 --> 52:08.080
tried to like pull them

52:08.080 --> 52:10.080
away from it I think that they will resist

52:10.080 --> 52:12.080
so you have to push them towards them like

52:12.080 --> 52:14.080
I think it's great the way you're using your

52:14.080 --> 52:16.080
dog's boner to promote the furniture

52:16.080 --> 52:18.080
and they'll be like what.

52:18.080 --> 52:20.080
Yeah I think it's great. I think dog boners really

52:20.080 --> 52:22.080
sell chairs and make them

52:22.080 --> 52:24.080
uncomfortable with how into it you are.

52:28.080 --> 52:30.080
If that doesn't work nothing will.

52:30.080 --> 52:32.080
Does that help Sarah.

52:32.080 --> 52:34.080
Does that help.

52:34.080 --> 52:36.080
Okay fair enough.

52:36.080 --> 52:38.080
Hey what's up. Hi I'm

52:38.080 --> 52:40.080
Manny. Hi Manny. I use she her

52:40.080 --> 52:42.080
pronouns. Hi Manny.

52:42.080 --> 52:44.080
Your question.

52:44.080 --> 52:46.080
Oh man.

52:46.080 --> 52:48.080
How do I

52:48.080 --> 52:50.080
convince children that I'm not a time

52:50.080 --> 52:52.080
traveler.

52:52.080 --> 52:54.080
Curious.

52:54.080 --> 52:56.080
Curious about this one.

52:56.080 --> 52:58.080
So I work at a living

52:58.080 --> 53:00.080
history museum.

53:00.080 --> 53:02.080
So

53:02.080 --> 53:04.080
so my

53:04.080 --> 53:06.080
job is to dress up like I'm in the

53:06.080 --> 53:08.080
1920s and then people come

53:08.080 --> 53:10.080
to the park and I teach them about

53:10.080 --> 53:12.080
what it was like to live in my hometown in the 1920s.

53:12.080 --> 53:14.080
But

53:14.080 --> 53:16.080
like at least once

53:16.080 --> 53:18.080
a week children will come up

53:18.080 --> 53:20.080
to me and try to explain to me

53:20.080 --> 53:22.080
modern technologies.

53:22.080 --> 53:24.080
Yes. Yes.

53:24.080 --> 53:26.080
So. Yes.

53:26.080 --> 53:28.080
So I'll get kids that

53:28.080 --> 53:30.080
come up to me and are like

53:30.080 --> 53:32.080
do you know what rap music is.

53:34.080 --> 53:36.080
Okay.

53:36.080 --> 53:38.080
But why would you want to stop.

53:38.080 --> 53:40.080
Yeah Manny I have to say if

53:40.080 --> 53:42.080
I could get young people to explain shit

53:42.080 --> 53:44.080
to me I would pay any fucking price.

53:44.080 --> 53:46.080
Yeah rules.

53:46.080 --> 53:48.080
If one of them is like

53:48.080 --> 53:50.080
if one of them is like hey

53:50.080 --> 53:52.080
let me explain Snapchat I'll fucking put on

53:52.080 --> 53:54.080
a handlebar mustache whatever the fuck

53:54.080 --> 53:56.080
I'll put in a monocle if you'll explain

53:56.080 --> 53:58.080
to me how Instagram works.

53:58.080 --> 54:00.080
It would be funny at first and then be like

54:00.080 --> 54:02.080
this is what a fence is.

54:02.080 --> 54:04.080
No but yes.

54:04.080 --> 54:06.080
Manny fuck this rule

54:06.080 --> 54:08.080
so bad. Here's the thing

54:08.080 --> 54:10.080
all you have to do is keep going what?

54:10.080 --> 54:12.080
This is a great

54:12.080 --> 54:14.080
do you walk all the way back to electricity

54:14.080 --> 54:16.080
like make it like. How deep does

54:16.080 --> 54:18.080
the LARP go. Do you have to

54:18.080 --> 54:20.080
they'll go back they'll say do you know

54:20.080 --> 54:22.080
they'll hold up their cell phone they'll say

54:22.080 --> 54:24.080
do you know what this is. Okay but do you

54:24.080 --> 54:26.080
have to play along as part of the job.

54:26.080 --> 54:28.080
Yes. Awesome.

54:28.080 --> 54:30.080
I have to

54:30.080 --> 54:32.080
I have to be historically accurate that's

54:32.080 --> 54:34.080
part of my job.

54:34.080 --> 54:36.080
Can we just

54:36.080 --> 54:38.080
if you're uncomfortable with

54:38.080 --> 54:40.080
this please say so I just want to

54:40.080 --> 54:42.080
know what this looks like with my eyes

54:42.080 --> 54:44.080
if I like make believe

54:44.080 --> 54:46.080
I'm a teen.

54:46.080 --> 54:48.080
Yeah can you like Manny can you like take a second and get into

54:48.080 --> 54:50.080
character.

54:50.080 --> 54:52.080
If you're uncomfortable seriously it is not a big deal.

54:52.080 --> 54:54.080
If you don't want to just say now it's fine.

54:54.080 --> 54:56.080
This

54:56.080 --> 54:58.080
this is an iPad.

54:58.080 --> 55:00.080
No no no no Manny has to agree to

55:00.080 --> 55:02.080
it. Yes. Okay.

55:04.080 --> 55:06.080
Well

55:06.080 --> 55:08.080
let Griffin let Griffin interact.

55:08.080 --> 55:10.080
This is

55:10.080 --> 55:12.080
you ever seen one of these it's called a fortnight.

55:12.080 --> 55:14.080
That's a fidget

55:14.080 --> 55:16.080
spinner. You ever seen one of these before.

55:16.080 --> 55:18.080
I don't know what that is. What

55:18.080 --> 55:20.080
is that. Okay let me

55:20.080 --> 55:22.080
I don't know. I want to hear Griffin. Griffin

55:22.080 --> 55:24.080
open this.

55:24.080 --> 55:26.080
There's a problem. I'm 31. I don't really know.

55:26.080 --> 55:28.080
Travis you pretend

55:28.080 --> 55:30.080
to be a teen and explain it to me so I can

55:30.080 --> 55:32.080
then continue. Oh shit.

55:32.080 --> 55:34.080
I don't know what a fortnight is.

55:34.080 --> 55:36.080
It's two weeks.

55:42.080 --> 55:44.080
Do you play a specific character

55:44.080 --> 55:46.080
from history or are you just kind of an

55:46.080 --> 55:48.080
extra from the 1920s. I'm an extra

55:48.080 --> 55:50.080
from the 90s. Okay. Okay. Can I try

55:50.080 --> 55:52.080
it. Griffin display your computer to me.

55:52.080 --> 55:54.080
Okay. Yeah this is a laptop

55:54.080 --> 55:56.080
that's

55:58.080 --> 56:00.080
sucked so bad.

56:02.080 --> 56:04.080
There is no amount of

56:04.080 --> 56:06.080
editing I can do to that to make it

56:06.080 --> 56:08.080
good for a podcast.

56:10.080 --> 56:12.080
The only thing you can realistically do

56:12.080 --> 56:14.080
is steal it and sell it to

56:14.080 --> 56:16.080
1920s scientists.

56:16.080 --> 56:18.080
Like that's what you would do. Oh fascinating.

56:18.080 --> 56:20.080
Next time they come back everyone

56:20.080 --> 56:22.080
has cell phones.

56:22.080 --> 56:24.080
You changed everything.

56:24.080 --> 56:26.080
You polluted the timeline.

56:28.080 --> 56:30.080
Oh my god.

56:30.080 --> 56:32.080
Can this park

56:32.080 --> 56:34.080
hire time cops

56:34.080 --> 56:36.080
to like bust people

56:36.080 --> 56:38.080
who are upsetting the

56:38.080 --> 56:40.080
flow of history. There are multiple

56:40.080 --> 56:42.080
eras in the park and we're not allowed

56:42.080 --> 56:44.080
to go into other eras in our

56:44.080 --> 56:46.080
future costumes. It's called time warping

56:46.080 --> 56:48.080
and it's against the law in the park.

56:48.080 --> 56:50.080
Yes.

56:56.080 --> 56:58.080
This is the greatest day of my life.

56:58.080 --> 57:00.080
Is there a sign present

57:00.080 --> 57:02.080
in the break room that says no

57:02.080 --> 57:04.080
time warping on it.

57:04.080 --> 57:06.080
No but they drill it into you during

57:06.080 --> 57:08.080
training. Fuck that's awesome. When you watch

57:08.080 --> 57:10.080
Rocky Horror Picture Show are you just like no

57:10.080 --> 57:12.080
no no.

57:12.080 --> 57:14.080
I don't see any of you idiots jump to the left

57:14.080 --> 57:16.080
or step to the right. You're done.

57:22.080 --> 57:24.080
Do you watch Westworld like yeah

57:24.080 --> 57:26.080
that's right. That's exactly

57:26.080 --> 57:28.080
it. Next time the kid shows you and talks about

57:28.080 --> 57:30.080
a different era have them take you there.

57:30.080 --> 57:32.080
Oh shit.

57:34.080 --> 57:36.080
Ziggy Piggy.

57:36.080 --> 57:40.080
Nuked food.

57:42.080 --> 57:44.080
That's the only two things I can remember from

57:44.080 --> 57:46.080
Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.

57:46.080 --> 57:48.080
Party on dudes.

57:48.080 --> 57:50.080
Yeah they said that. So great.

57:50.080 --> 57:52.080
Does that.

57:52.080 --> 57:54.080
I'm just so fucking jealous of your cool

57:54.080 --> 57:56.080
job in life.

57:56.080 --> 57:58.080
What's the park called. Can we get there

57:58.080 --> 58:00.080
in like a day. It's in Canada.

58:00.080 --> 58:02.080
So no.

58:02.080 --> 58:04.080
We're not allowed back there

58:04.080 --> 58:06.080
anymore.

58:06.080 --> 58:08.080
Yeah we did our best. Anyway

58:08.080 --> 58:10.080
thanks Manny. Hope that helps. Thank you. Thanks so much.

58:10.080 --> 58:12.080
I don't know if we helped at all.

58:14.080 --> 58:16.080
So there are two people

58:16.080 --> 58:18.080
we've called who have decided. No no no.

58:18.080 --> 58:20.080
Okay. Hey hey. Hey hello hello hello.

58:20.080 --> 58:22.080
Hi what's what's your

58:22.080 --> 58:24.080
I almost said which one are you.

58:24.080 --> 58:26.080
What's your name.

58:26.080 --> 58:28.080
Hi Liz. Okay Liz do you

58:28.080 --> 58:30.080
want to call the next person so they can start moving.

58:30.080 --> 58:32.080
Not you Liz.

58:32.080 --> 58:34.080
Oh I was confused by the construction

58:34.080 --> 58:36.080
of that sentence. Liz pick a person at random.

58:36.080 --> 58:38.080
Caesar row

58:38.080 --> 58:40.080
FF seat eight.

58:40.080 --> 58:42.080
Yeah seat eight.

58:42.080 --> 58:44.080
So come on down there

58:44.080 --> 58:46.080
and we're going to talk to Liz for a second.

58:46.080 --> 58:48.080
Liz

58:48.080 --> 58:50.080
asked. Oh it's another

58:50.080 --> 58:52.080
one of these.

58:52.080 --> 58:54.080
I work in a time travel park.

58:54.080 --> 58:56.080
No.

58:56.080 --> 58:58.080
No the other one.

58:58.080 --> 59:00.080
My friend's dick will

59:00.080 --> 59:02.080
be on TV. Should I look.

59:10.080 --> 59:12.080
It's tough. Go on.

59:12.080 --> 59:14.080
It's tough go on.

59:14.080 --> 59:16.080
Yeah he doesn't know that I

59:16.080 --> 59:18.080
know that it's going to be on TV.

59:18.080 --> 59:20.080
Does he know that it's going to be on TV.

59:20.080 --> 59:22.080
Yes.

59:22.080 --> 59:24.080
Was he the Teen Wolf guy

59:24.080 --> 59:26.080
and it was an accident this whole time.

59:26.080 --> 59:28.080
You all know the Teen Wolf has a dick in it.

59:28.080 --> 59:30.080
Guess not. End of joke.

59:30.080 --> 59:32.080
So explain everything.

59:32.080 --> 59:34.080
He's an actor.

59:34.080 --> 59:36.080
Cool. And I want to support

59:36.080 --> 59:38.080
him and he was cast in a

59:38.080 --> 59:40.080
premium cable show.

59:40.080 --> 59:42.080
Oh yeah.

59:42.080 --> 59:44.080
I assume by the way there

59:44.080 --> 59:46.080
aren't many other TV

59:46.080 --> 59:48.080
dick opportunities except on.

59:48.080 --> 59:50.080
This is the weirdest

59:50.080 --> 59:52.080
episode of CSI New York I've ever

59:52.080 --> 59:54.080
seen. He was cast in an ABC

59:54.080 --> 59:56.080
family show.

59:56.080 --> 59:58.080
But he hasn't told

59:58.080 --> 01:00:00.080
anybody except for my friend who told me

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:02.080
when she was drunk that he was going to

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:04.080
do full frontal

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.080
and he's just been working out

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:08.080
and being like I'm preparing for a role.

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.080
Working out

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.080
what exactly.

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.080
Well I want to

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.080
support him but I

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.080
but do I?

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.080
No you want to

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:22.080
I don't think there's any question about

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:24.080
looking because you should

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.080
enjoy you should enjoy the work

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.080
and not stigmatize the

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:30.080
work. But there's more

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.080
questions that come after that

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:34.080
answer.

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:36.080
I feel like a lot of

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.080
college students have probably pondered

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.080
this when their friend was in a production of

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:42.080
Hair.

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:44.080
I feel like Equus

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:46.080
or

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.080
but of course if the question is

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.080
should I look at Daniel Radcliffe's dick the answer

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.080
is yeah. That's Harry Potter

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:54.080
my friend.

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.080
You ain't gonna see that again.

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.080
I actually think

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:00.080
not to take a question

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.080
and make it too real but I actually think

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.080
that you watching and saying like hey you did a great job

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.080
and not making it a big deal.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.080
Oh yeah don't say anything about his penis

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.080
you do that already.

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.080
This is a comedy podcast you didn't

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:14.080
Travis maybe thinks you thought

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:16.080
that we needed to tell you to

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:18.080
not say no.

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:20.080
Very good acting and a nice hug.

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:22.080
That's not

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.080
expected or appreciated.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.080
You coming out of it in any

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:28.080
kind of like awkward way where it's

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:30.080
like well what do I say just saying like oh

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.080
it was great it was a great job like

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:34.080
normalizing that

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:36.080
I think will go a long way for your friend who was

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:38.080
probably a little bit nervous about doing it.

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:40.080
Absolutely.

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.080
I think being supportive is good

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:44.080
absolutely do

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.080
it and maybe we get more

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.080
hogs on TV.

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:50.080
We do need more thank you Griffin

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.080
yes.

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.080
We're going to need a lot of hogs to

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:56.080
correct that imbalance over the years but I think

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.080
we can do it.

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.080
More hogs by the end of 2019.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:02.080
This is why we got to make season 2 of My Brother

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:04.080
My Brother Invade.

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.080
But yeah I

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:14.080
think watch it your friends going to be on

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.080
TV it's not like it's a secret thing.

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.080
Watch it and tell them

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:20.080
they did a great job. So Westworld or Game of Thrones?

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:22.080
You don't have to say.

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:24.080
I was going to say Chuck

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:26.080
that's not a show anymore is it?

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:28.080
Chuck?

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:30.080
It popped into my head

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.080
because of that one

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:34.080
weird scene. Is it Sabrina the Teenage Witch

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.080
or West Wing?

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.080
Does

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:44.080
that help? Yeah

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:46.080
I'm going to look at it.

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:56.080
That was very

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:58.080
good. Cesar are you down here?

01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.080
I think we're good we got two more people

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.080
Hey what's up?

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:04.080
Hi. What's your name? Carly.

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:06.080
Carly yes I may have forgotten that we called

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:08.080
two people down and I got very scared but what's up?

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:10.080
It's okay.

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.080
Your question?

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.080
It's a precautionary tale.

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:16.080
Not handing your sister

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:18.080
your phone and saying send whatever.

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:20.080
Oh no.

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:22.080
Do you still want to go through with it because if the answer is no.

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:24.080
It's okay.

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:26.080
She's

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:28.080
furious so it's hilarious.

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:30.080
Guys

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.080
you are about to get the fucking

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:34.080
Rosetta Stone to understand

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:36.080
everything that we've been talking about

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.080
for the past minute. Carly's question

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.080
what's your sister's name?

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:42.080
Kayla. Kayla? Yep.

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:44.080
Kayla's question for Carly

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:46.080
was

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:48.080
I've never listened to your guys

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:50.080
show before so I don't understand

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.080
a lot of your references. Can you guys

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:54.080
summarize your show for me?

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:04.080
The sad thing Carly is there haven't

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.080
been that many in jokes

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.080
in this one. They've all

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:10.080
just kind of been regular jokes

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:12.080
you didn't like.

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:14.080
And that's

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:16.080
fine. That's totally

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:18.080
fine.

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:20.080
I do appreciate that you heard jokes that you

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.080
didn't get and thought surely

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:24.080
there's something more to this.

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.080
No it's

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:28.080
been good. Thank you.

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:30.080
That's so cool. Thank you Carly.

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:32.080
That means a lot. Do you like horses?

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:34.080
Do I like horses?

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.080
This is

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.080
dope. Like we never get

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:40.080
we never focus test.

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.080
This is dope. You like horses?

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:46.080
Now do you think it would be funny if

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.080
three people were super into

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.080
them?

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:52.080
It was deeply ironic

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:54.080
and everybody kind of knew it.

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:56.080
Still know it looks like.

01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:58.080
How do you feel about ghosts?

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.080
Ghosts are great.

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.080
Yeah.

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:04.080
Not anymore unfortunately.

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.080
Is this

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:08.080
whole thing a facade? This is a real breakfast

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:10.080
at Tiffany's situation right now Carly.

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:12.080
I like Dungeons and Dragons.

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.080
Hey.

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:16.080
Are you coming tomorrow?

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.080
I am coming tomorrow.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.080
Okay. Because Kayla had

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:22.080
tickets for both and I said sure.

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.080
Carly you could have stopped there.

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:32.080
So we're brothers.

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:34.080
Yeah. That's cool.

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:36.080
We do.

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.080
That's not real. That's not real. We used to tell people

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:40.080
it was a comedy advice show and

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:42.080
then we had someone who was opening for us

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:44.080
say that they were disappointed that we didn't

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:46.080
give more advice about how to do comedy

01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:48.080
better.

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:50.080
So we don't say comedy advice show anymore.

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.080
Then we start saying it's a bad advice

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:54.080
show and that's

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:56.080
I mean that just sounds bad.

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:58.080
That sounds I mean it sounds like Dr.

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:02.080
Oz but.

01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:08.080
Are we forgetting anything?

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.080
And West Virginia right?

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.080
Yeah. West by God Virginia.

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:14.080
Carly does that help?

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.080
It does and congratulations

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:18.080
on Fallout 76.

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:20.080
Thank you very much.

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:24.080
We asked Todd

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.080
very nicely.

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:28.080
I appreciate

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.080
everybody in the line to ask

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:32.080
a question is giving the person in front of them a good

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:34.080
45 feet.

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.080
Do you want.

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:38.080
Yes. I think this is this

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.080
will probably be our last question. Caesar hello.

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.080
Hi. Your fucking

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:44.080
question. My dog.

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:46.080
What should

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:48.080
my wife's first cuss words

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:50.080
be.

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:54.080
Yes.

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:56.080
We're waiting.

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.080
So

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:00.080
we just got married last week.

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:02.080
Congratulations.

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:04.080
Your wife

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:06.080
is your wife here.

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:08.080
Is your wife here. Yes she's up there.

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:10.080
Hello.

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.080
Everybody in the balcony at the same time.

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:14.080
And now of course as tradition states

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.080
once you are married you're finally allowed to curse.

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.080
And she has never cursed before. Yes you are.

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.080
Can you come down also.

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.080
I know it's an imposition.

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:26.080
It's going to be weird if we don't talk to you too.

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.080
If you don't want to it's fine.

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.080
It's completely fine. It's your choice.

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:32.080
We'll talk to Caesar for a second let you think about it.

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:34.080
What if you just

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.080
from your seat yelled out a cuss word right now

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:38.080
and completely negated.

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.080
That'll be the end of it but we have

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:42.080
some time to get there.

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:44.080
How does something like that

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.080
even fucking happen Caesar.

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:48.080
So as she

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.080
told me. Wait hold on.

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:52.080
Are you talking about this. Yeah.

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:54.080
No she's good.

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:56.080
Can I get a thumbs up confirmation

01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:58.080
from. Yeah we're good.

01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:00.080
Doesn't want to talk about it herself

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.080
for sure. All right.

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:04.080
So. So.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:06.080
Just didn't know any. Bible school.

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:08.080
Oh.

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:10.080
Told her

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:12.080
Bible school teacher told her had a friend

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:14.080
that she said that they once cursed

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:16.080
and that when they sat down on the toilet

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:18.080
a rat bit them. Yeah.

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.080
No no no don't get it no don't get it twisted.

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:22.080
That's why they're called curse words.

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:26.080
And.

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.080
She just never did it and then it was kind of

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.080
just stuck. Holy

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:32.080
shit. That's

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:34.080
we're going to curse a lot I feel like during this one but

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:36.080
not out of like a joke like

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.080
we can curse but because

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.080
everything that has been said so far

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:42.080
is the most buck wild.

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.080
I know what I said earlier I don't want you to yell

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.080
it out here for the show because that's selfish of

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.080
us. I do like if everyone closed

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:50.080
their eyes maybe we turn the lights down

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:52.080
and just from the darkness we just heard

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:54.080
Piss. Yeah we did a little

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.080
little piss in the graveyard

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:58.080
game real quick.

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.080
Does your wife

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:02.080
use other. Sorry her name

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:04.080
Lizzie.

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:06.080
Still Lizzie use

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:08.080
other. I'm sorry Paul made this

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:10.080
drink so strong. I'm just

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:12.080
fucking barely hanging on.

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:14.080
Does Lizzie use

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:16.080
substitute curse words like

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:18.080
during it like Laura during

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:20.080
it.

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.080
Not really. No Lizzie

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.080
is trying to hammer a nail into the wall. She

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:26.080
fucks up hits her thumb. What

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:28.080
sound does she produce.

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.080
She kind of just I think would yell

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.080
and collapse.

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:34.080
Jesus how are you shot. So she's never

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.080
cursed and she's got glass thumb.

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.080
Great.

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.080
And she would just like I said

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:42.080
just yell.

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:44.080
Does Lizzie want

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:46.080
a curse. I think

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:48.080
so. Yeah not here. He doesn't

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:50.080
have to be here.

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:52.080
OK.

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.080
OK OK. We have

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:04.080
a few minutes. We have to wait

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.080
this Travis says piss. I think

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:08.080
bastard could be good.

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.080
What

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:12.080
about this all

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:14.080
beans.

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:16.080
I think I don't think this is

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:18.080
up to us to decide. Lizzie it's your first

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.080
cuss. Can we turn it. Would you like the lights

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:22.080
down with that. Let's get

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.080
yeah. We turn out

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.080
literally. We take the house lights out

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:28.080
so I want. I told Caesar

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:30.080
this would be a wedding present for him.

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:32.080
My first curse word.

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:34.080
OK Lizzie so what I'm going to ask you

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:36.080
for is five seconds of

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:38.080
silence. I want

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:40.080
all to be completely silent

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:42.080
and then we'll hear a curse word from

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.080
somebody. No. And it'll be

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:46.080
Lizzie. I mean it's going to be safe from somebody

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:48.080
and somebody else from the audience is going to yell it.

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:50.080
Nobody else. You will be ejected from

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:52.080
the theater. This is the most important thing to ever happen on this podcast.

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:54.080
We all get to

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.080
experience it together.

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:58.080
So Lizzie I'll ask you for a few seconds of

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.080
silence and then just drop it on us.

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:02.080
Go ahead.

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:22.080
