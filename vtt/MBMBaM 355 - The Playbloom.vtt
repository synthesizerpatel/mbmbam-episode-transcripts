00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.280
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

00:47.280 --> 00:51.040
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:51.040 --> 00:56.800
I'm your middle-ist brother, Travis McElroy. Well, I guess that makes me your sweet baby

00:56.800 --> 01:04.400
brother. We were supposed to talk about Eurovision this morning, and then I realized I didn't have

01:04.400 --> 01:13.040
anything funny to say about it, except Sweden was robbed by Portugal. It was an actual robbery

01:13.760 --> 01:19.920
perpetrated on the world stage. Yeah, the Swedish song about premature ejaculation is amazing,

01:19.920 --> 01:24.160
and should have won. It was called I Can't Go On. I don't think they were talking about

01:24.160 --> 01:29.680
that nut. He's talking about that it makes him want to take off all his clothes,

01:29.680 --> 01:33.440
and that the person he's singing to is so beautiful that he can't go on,

01:33.440 --> 01:37.920
and he's got to keep it together. I'm saying Eurovision has a vetting process

01:38.560 --> 01:44.800
to make sure that nut songs don't get through. Griffin, I'm sorry. This is not a joke I am

01:44.800 --> 01:49.840
making. The Sweden song is about premature ejaculation and trying to hold back.

01:49.840 --> 01:56.560
You guys are talking about that, and it reminded me of a much more important fact is that I watched

01:56.560 --> 02:04.080
Fifty Shades of Grey last night. Talking about that nut, though.

02:04.080 --> 02:10.640
Sydney and I had a good post-Eurovision drunk going, and we decided to keep up the fun.

02:10.640 --> 02:13.920
To catch the zeitgeist. Fifty Shades of Grey,

02:13.920 --> 02:20.960
The Orig, because two, Fifty Shades Darker, just came out on iTunes, but we didn't watch that one.

02:20.960 --> 02:29.040
We watched Fifty Shades of Grey. Hey, everybody, that shit is buck wild.

02:29.040 --> 02:34.880
How did we let that happen? Is that where things got away from us? I worry.

02:35.680 --> 02:41.840
Here's the most important fact about Fifty Shades. When I brought it up to Sydney,

02:41.840 --> 02:48.960
because it is ludicrous, she said, oh, well, that's from the book. So here's what it is.

02:49.520 --> 02:54.640
He has a room called the playroom, right? Christian Grey.

02:54.640 --> 02:59.520
Well, it sounds fun. And that's where he keeps Cherry and Flory

02:59.520 --> 03:03.920
and Clocky. And Harnessy and Buttpluggy.

03:05.520 --> 03:09.840
She says, is that where you keep your Xbox? Hey, will you play me a cartoon?

03:09.840 --> 03:12.640
All right, Buttpluggy. You're the boss.

03:12.640 --> 03:16.560
Is that where you keep your Xbox? And he says, no, but I thought it'd be rad if he was like,

03:16.560 --> 03:21.440
well, yes, but also sexy. Yeah, but I don't have a lot of space.

03:22.320 --> 03:28.240
I don't have many of the newest games. I have Madden 11.

03:28.240 --> 03:34.480
When he goes in there and he says to her, you're going to be my sex person.

03:34.480 --> 03:42.320
And you're my submissive and you're my sex person. She has to like get on the ground on all fours

03:42.320 --> 03:45.600
with like a blindfold or something. And Flory's like, what's up?

03:46.720 --> 03:51.920
She's all naked. And that's like, and you just wait for me.

03:51.920 --> 04:00.160
And then when he comes in, this man is wearing sex jeans.

04:00.160 --> 04:09.280
And what I'm saying to you is that he has discrete jeans for sex that are ripped.

04:09.280 --> 04:14.640
So he's not wearing the sex jeans at the beginning of the scene.

04:14.640 --> 04:21.680
He leaves the room and comes back in wearing sex jeans that he does not remove.

04:21.680 --> 04:30.240
He just wears the sex jeans the entire time he is in the playroom

04:30.240 --> 04:33.680
with Buttpluggy and the Xbox and everything.

04:33.680 --> 04:36.400
Actually, I just saw a Skype notification that you've sent me a link.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.640
And I think this might be one that I don't want to.

04:38.640 --> 04:41.040
No, I wouldn't have to click on it.

04:41.040 --> 04:44.320
Yeah, it's just, if you get a visual of him, it's just like,

04:44.320 --> 04:49.760
it looks like Incredible Hulk post transformation with like torn sex jeans.

04:49.760 --> 04:52.160
That this gentleman wears all the time.

04:52.160 --> 04:54.640
A quick diversion to express.

04:54.640 --> 04:58.240
And now I'm gonna fall into the gap if you know what I'm saying.

04:58.240 --> 05:03.520
Yeah, if there's a, if you, he never takes the sex jeans off.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.440
He just wears the sex jeans all the time.

05:05.440 --> 05:07.600
Is he a never nude?

05:07.600 --> 05:10.400
Apparently he's a never nude is what he's talking about.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.880
God, that would be such a fucking twist.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.920
If in Shades of Grey he's like, but I'm, I just want you to know,

05:15.920 --> 05:18.480
I want to do all kinds of sex stuff with you.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.640
I'm not comfortable being naked though.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.720
And I will have to turn the lights off.

05:22.720 --> 05:29.680
I just want to rub my wormy up against this carpenter cut denim is my whole thing.

05:29.680 --> 05:30.960
These sweet jinkos.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.760
Sign this, sign this contract.

05:33.760 --> 05:34.320
I'm going to wait.

05:34.320 --> 05:37.440
And then the line A, A1A sort of the first,

05:37.440 --> 05:40.720
the preamble is basically about how these jeans never coming off.

05:40.720 --> 05:43.040
These jeans are mine and I need them.

05:43.040 --> 05:46.160
And the sex contract is written out on my jeans.

05:46.160 --> 05:50.240
You get prescription jeans and I need these for everything.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.840
It's pretty good.

05:53.840 --> 05:54.720
It's pretty great.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.280
All of the movie is excellent.

05:57.280 --> 05:58.880
Can I ask you a question?

05:59.440 --> 06:00.240
Anything.

06:00.240 --> 06:01.120
Ask me anything.

06:01.120 --> 06:01.920
AMA.

06:01.920 --> 06:04.000
I watched all of Fifty Shades of Grey drug.

06:04.000 --> 06:04.500
AMA.

06:05.360 --> 06:05.860
Did it.

06:06.640 --> 06:07.760
How horny did you get?

06:08.320 --> 06:08.820
Yeah.

06:11.920 --> 06:13.440
Did I mention the jeans?

06:13.440 --> 06:14.720
No, you did mention the jeans,

06:14.720 --> 06:17.040
but you don't have to be childish about it.

06:17.040 --> 06:18.400
It's an adult movie for adults.

06:18.400 --> 06:21.440
And obviously I'm, we're all over 30 now.

06:21.440 --> 06:25.520
And so we can talk about stuff like your chubs, like your chubby.

06:25.520 --> 06:26.880
We hear every, we hear it.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.880
My brother, my brother and me, we are sex positive.

06:29.840 --> 06:32.240
We have many listeners who are in, you know,

06:32.240 --> 06:36.800
the SM S and M, uh, Dom, you know, sub scene.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.240
That's totally cool, Justin.

06:38.240 --> 06:40.560
So however many boners you got,

06:40.560 --> 06:41.200
Chubs.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.040
Did it get no kink shaming?

06:43.040 --> 06:45.440
There's gene shaming happening here.

06:45.440 --> 06:49.760
What I'm saying is I'm sex positive and Christian Grey is,

06:49.760 --> 06:51.600
is nudity negative.

06:51.600 --> 06:55.520
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

06:56.560 --> 06:57.520
Can't go jeans.

06:58.320 --> 06:59.040
All right.

06:59.040 --> 06:59.760
Very good.

06:59.760 --> 07:00.720
K and KO.

07:00.720 --> 07:01.760
You gotta get them.

07:01.760 --> 07:02.480
You gotta get them.

07:02.480 --> 07:06.160
You can keep a fucking Game Boy Advance SP in there.

07:06.160 --> 07:11.360
And also six plugs for a butt in there to have fun with.

07:11.360 --> 07:12.320
Not your butt though.

07:12.320 --> 07:13.840
Your jeans staying on.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.520
The jeans are staying on.

07:15.520 --> 07:19.360
But you can keep a full bag of jerky in those jeans.

07:19.360 --> 07:20.800
Justin, were there openings?

07:20.800 --> 07:22.240
You said the jeans were ripped.

07:22.240 --> 07:25.600
Were there openings in the jeans that allowed him to engage?

07:25.600 --> 07:29.440
Or was this like, oh, I was going to buy, uh,

07:29.440 --> 07:33.520
like a extreme restraints, uh, cage for my penis,

07:33.520 --> 07:37.120
but I forgot to order it in time and it won't be here till Thursday.

07:37.120 --> 07:40.560
So I'm going to do the next best thing and put them in a denim prison.

07:40.560 --> 07:46.240
No, no, he scooches them down below his penis.

07:46.240 --> 07:49.280
Like he's peeing in the trough at a minor league baseball game.

07:49.840 --> 07:54.480
Like he, he just, he just scooches them down to do it.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.720
To do the thing, to do the darn thing.

07:56.720 --> 08:01.600
A lot of avoiding the subject of the sort of chubby inquisition.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.440
There's no arousal.

08:03.440 --> 08:04.320
It's negative arousal.

08:04.320 --> 08:06.640
Everyone in the movie is very attractive, right?

08:06.640 --> 08:09.360
The jeans kill every bit of eroticism.

08:09.360 --> 08:14.480
Because like, all I can feel for Puerto Cota Johnson is, um, uh, uh,

08:14.480 --> 08:19.600
you know, the, the, she, she has to be with a man in jeans.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.240
Always.

08:20.240 --> 08:21.680
Yeah, Justin, hold on.

08:21.680 --> 08:22.560
Oh, Justin.

08:22.560 --> 08:23.680
Now you've made me wonder.

08:24.320 --> 08:27.280
I assume there's more than one sex scene in Fifty Shades of Grey.

08:27.840 --> 08:31.120
Did the jeans reappear every time?

08:31.920 --> 08:34.640
Is he like, wait, if we're going to do it, I'll be right back.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.800
It's not a single scene, Travis.

08:36.800 --> 08:40.640
What I'm saying to you is there's a couple scenes in this playroom area

08:40.640 --> 08:45.840
where the, like, the, the supposedly taboo things happen.

08:45.840 --> 08:49.600
And, um, it, it, he's always in the jeans.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.360
And every, every time he's in the jeans.

08:52.480 --> 08:57.840
Maybe you saw a, were you watching this on the stars at 7 PM

08:57.840 --> 09:01.520
and maybe these jeans were CGI'd in so that like they could,

09:01.520 --> 09:03.760
they could show it on stars or-

09:03.760 --> 09:07.200
Did he stub his toe and, and yell, oh, we's a lover!

09:07.200 --> 09:08.800
Cause that's a pretty good-

09:08.800 --> 09:10.880
A bit where he comes around a corner weird

09:10.880 --> 09:12.400
and he kind of jukes real fast

09:12.400 --> 09:16.160
and the jeans take like a half second to catch up with his pubis.

09:17.520 --> 09:21.120
Was there much jeans lag on the stars channel you were watching this on?

09:21.120 --> 09:23.200
They were not animated cartoon jeans.

09:23.760 --> 09:26.240
Um, there is a, she reveals to him,

09:26.240 --> 09:31.760
but before he gets into his, his dark proclivities,

09:31.760 --> 09:34.560
he reveals, she reveals to him that she's a virgin.

09:34.560 --> 09:38.080
And his reaction to that is to scoop her up

09:38.080 --> 09:39.440
and she says, what are you doing?

09:39.440 --> 09:43.840
And he says, I quote, I'm rectifying the situation.

09:43.840 --> 09:44.340
Yay-o!

09:45.200 --> 09:48.960
So when you talk about, when you talk about how many chubbies,

09:48.960 --> 09:50.720
that's why it's negative.

09:50.720 --> 09:53.440
Ding-dong, shoot, man, fuck.

09:53.440 --> 09:54.320
It's rough.

09:55.200 --> 09:58.560
Also in pro- like she's supposed to be,

09:58.560 --> 10:04.960
uh, you know, completely, uh, um, uh, ignorant of this world, right?

10:04.960 --> 10:05.460
Yeah.

10:05.460 --> 10:08.720
He buys her a computer and she, he says,

10:08.720 --> 10:10.960
I hope you use this to do some research.

10:10.960 --> 10:11.200
Okay.

10:11.200 --> 10:13.280
And she texts him and says, what should I search?

10:14.080 --> 10:16.720
He says, try submissive.

10:16.720 --> 10:21.280
And it's like, okay, I know she's ignorant of S&M,

10:21.280 --> 10:23.760
but she's ignorant of like Google?

10:23.760 --> 10:26.880
Like, is he going to give her like a Boolean walkthrough right now

10:26.880 --> 10:29.760
of like how to get information about S&M?

10:29.760 --> 10:31.120
It seems unlikely.

10:31.120 --> 10:32.560
Justin, having-

10:32.560 --> 10:34.000
She also, wait, I need to finish this.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.600
I need to finish this one point before I move on.

10:36.560 --> 10:41.120
They take her ignorance of the S&M lifestyle to its absolute extreme

10:41.120 --> 10:43.360
because when they're going through the sex contract

10:43.360 --> 10:46.480
and she's eliminating genital clamps from the contract

10:46.480 --> 10:50.480
as something that like is good for her, she asks him,

10:50.480 --> 10:53.840
this is a direct quote, what's a butt plug?

10:53.840 --> 10:55.920
And I wanted to sit down with her at that point

10:55.920 --> 10:58.800
and just walk into the movie Purple Rose of Cairo style

10:58.800 --> 11:01.760
and be like, hey Dakota, hey Dakota,

11:01.760 --> 11:04.160
what do you think a butt plug could be?

11:04.160 --> 11:06.560
Also, this is what, 2015?

11:06.560 --> 11:09.600
You have not contextually picked up in the world

11:09.600 --> 11:12.240
the concept of butt, like I don't care.

11:12.240 --> 11:12.960
I'm not butt plug experienced.

11:12.960 --> 11:15.120
Travis, you can go into fucking caveman times

11:15.120 --> 11:16.880
and if it's called a butt plug,

11:18.080 --> 11:20.880
probably we are going to figure it out.

11:20.880 --> 11:24.080
It's a special type of cup that you use for tea.

11:24.080 --> 11:27.920
No, it's a silly little guy and it gets in there

11:27.920 --> 11:29.600
and it holds it all up or in or what.

11:29.600 --> 11:30.960
I'm not sure what the function is

11:30.960 --> 11:33.920
but I bet it feels fucking great.

11:33.920 --> 11:38.400
Damn, now I'm all rock hard talking about all this junk.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.040
I'm kind of in disbelief of how long we've been talking

11:41.040 --> 11:45.040
about Fifty Shades of Grey in May 14th, 2017 AD,

11:45.040 --> 11:46.880
the year of our Lord Christ Jesus.

11:46.880 --> 11:51.840
I just, I feel bad for, I feel very bad for people

11:51.840 --> 11:55.920
who, for whom SM is a fetish for them

11:55.920 --> 11:59.440
because if this is the world's touchstone for your thing.

11:59.440 --> 12:00.280
It's not good.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.800
That's not, it's probably, we probably should,

12:02.800 --> 12:05.520
yeah, it is a negative, I think, in terms of awareness.

12:05.520 --> 12:09.280
It's probably how I feel every time I go to a Superman movie

12:09.280 --> 12:12.480
and I'm like, yeah, this time they'll get it right.

12:12.480 --> 12:15.440
And I always walk out like, no, I'm not into Superman.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.920
I don't know why I was here, I'm embarrassed.

12:17.920 --> 12:20.240
It's as if somebody went and saw Space Jam

12:20.240 --> 12:21.840
and then went to a basketball game

12:21.840 --> 12:24.240
and then was disappointed that nobody was stretching

12:24.240 --> 12:26.720
their arms across half of the court to dunk it

12:27.520 --> 12:33.680
while a bunch of big colorful monsters hurt the Bugs Bunny.

12:33.680 --> 12:36.080
Okay, here's a quick, I have not read this

12:36.080 --> 12:38.240
but here's a headline from Cosmopolitan.

12:38.240 --> 12:40.400
In case you wanted to know what Christian Grey

12:40.400 --> 12:42.160
really calls his sex genes.

12:42.160 --> 12:45.440
Well, what's he call, don't fucking tell me now.

12:46.320 --> 12:47.440
Are you guys ready?

12:47.440 --> 12:47.840
Yes.

12:50.080 --> 12:50.880
This is from the book.

12:52.160 --> 12:54.960
In my closet, I strip off all my clothes

12:55.680 --> 12:59.280
and from a drawer pull out my favorite jeans.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.120
My DJs.

13:02.160 --> 13:03.040
Dom jeans.

13:05.280 --> 13:06.800
Happy Mother's Day, everybody.

13:06.800 --> 13:11.760
Go out, get to fucking J.Crew, get to Express

13:11.760 --> 13:13.360
and go pick up a new pair of Dom jeans.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.040
You're gonna love these things.

13:15.040 --> 13:17.360
Is it possible, is it possible?

13:17.360 --> 13:20.560
Is it just possible that we're having this conversation

13:20.560 --> 13:23.120
and we're gonna get like 5,000 emails that are like,

13:23.120 --> 13:24.240
yeah, Dom jeans.

13:24.240 --> 13:25.520
Yeah, I don't care.

13:26.160 --> 13:28.160
I don't, I'll take, I will take that

13:28.800 --> 13:29.840
because you know what?

13:29.840 --> 13:31.600
Just because it's a part of S&M culture,

13:31.600 --> 13:33.760
if it is, I can't be, if it is,

13:34.800 --> 13:37.360
the cultures can grow and evolve by definition.

13:37.360 --> 13:41.600
I, an outsider will help you pass this S&M culture.

13:41.600 --> 13:42.960
You cannot have Dom jeans.

13:43.760 --> 13:45.600
One, it sounds like mom jeans.

13:45.600 --> 13:46.960
It sounds exactly like mom jeans.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.360
Exactly like mom jeans, Dom jeans.

13:49.360 --> 13:51.520
I slip them on and fasten all the buttons

13:51.520 --> 13:53.040
except the top one.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.760
From the same drawer, I retrieve the new riding crop

13:55.760 --> 13:57.280
and a gray waffle robe.

13:57.280 --> 13:59.280
As I leave, I grab a few condoms

13:59.280 --> 14:01.040
and stuff them into my pocket.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.360
Here goes, showtime, Gray.

14:03.360 --> 14:06.160
Cowboy hat, cowboy hat, yes or no?

14:06.160 --> 14:09.120
Can't decide in the end, decide next time.

14:10.000 --> 14:10.800
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

14:10.800 --> 14:14.320
Is it possible that he needs the jeans

14:14.320 --> 14:16.320
to put condoms in?

14:16.320 --> 14:19.680
Like he doesn't, he doesn't want to walk in the room

14:19.680 --> 14:21.200
with a handful of condoms

14:21.200 --> 14:22.560
because apparently he needs a few.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.880
He needs several, yeah, he's extremely safe.

14:24.880 --> 14:26.960
He just has it, what's in here?

14:26.960 --> 14:33.360
Oh, my condoms and some bazooka Joe and some chapstick.

14:33.360 --> 14:34.640
And 83 cents.

14:35.360 --> 14:37.920
Yeah, I'm looking, I just found the page

14:37.920 --> 14:39.840
you were on, Justin, in this book.

14:39.840 --> 14:41.520
I got the e-book on my Kindle now.

14:41.520 --> 14:43.680
I'm looking through it and let me just catch up

14:43.680 --> 14:45.760
to call my Dom jeans, put condoms in the pockets.

14:46.560 --> 14:47.760
I don't call them my Dom jeans

14:47.760 --> 14:52.560
because I'm a dominant in the sexual Congress.

14:52.560 --> 14:55.120
I actually call them that because I got them

14:55.120 --> 14:57.360
from my friend, late great actor

14:57.360 --> 14:59.200
and television producer, Dom Deluise.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.920
That's funny that Dom Deluise would get him sex,

15:01.920 --> 15:03.360
like pants for sex in it.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.040
We've now spent a quarter of this episode

15:05.040 --> 15:06.560
talking about 50 Shades of Gray

15:06.560 --> 15:10.640
and if we do any more, I think that,

15:10.640 --> 15:13.280
I think I might just like call this one like episode

15:13.280 --> 15:17.760
like 152 or something, drop it in sort of in media res.

15:19.200 --> 15:22.320
And so it will be like more sort of chronologically appropriate.

15:22.960 --> 15:24.080
Have you guys seen this dress?

15:24.080 --> 15:25.840
Is it blue and black or white and gold?

15:25.840 --> 15:27.600
I'm so super confused.

15:28.880 --> 15:31.120
Okay, so anyway, we'll do a question now

15:31.120 --> 15:33.360
because apparently I'm not allowed to talk about

15:33.360 --> 15:34.800
50 Shades of Gray anymore.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.840
Is there never a moment when he comes out in the jeans,

15:37.840 --> 15:38.880
there has to be at least one,

15:38.880 --> 15:40.480
he's probably had multiple partners,

15:40.480 --> 15:42.160
at least one partner probably to be like,

15:42.160 --> 15:46.960
oh yeah, Christian, what's the,

15:48.640 --> 15:49.920
what's with the jeans?

15:50.640 --> 15:52.480
What's the deal with the jeans?

15:53.600 --> 15:55.280
What he does is he takes a woman

15:55.280 --> 15:56.560
and they sign the contract

15:56.560 --> 16:00.000
and then they live in his house in a special room for this.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.920
And she asked him like,

16:01.920 --> 16:03.920
how many women have you had like this?

16:03.920 --> 16:06.320
And he says 15, which seems high,

16:06.320 --> 16:07.840
but maybe they're not getting scared off

16:07.840 --> 16:09.200
by like the whips and stuff.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.840
Maybe it's just like, I can't with the jeans.

16:11.840 --> 16:12.560
I have to go.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.760
Is there a line in the contracts that says like,

16:15.760 --> 16:17.520
I will not ask about the jeans.

16:18.320 --> 16:20.400
Promise not to mention the jeans out loud.

16:21.360 --> 16:23.440
The fact that it passes without comment, by the way,

16:23.440 --> 16:25.520
is the most ludicrous thing in the entire film.

16:25.520 --> 16:26.800
She comments about everything.

16:26.800 --> 16:27.920
She doesn't know what butt plugs are.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.480
He walks in with jeans and she's just like, uh-huh.

16:30.480 --> 16:31.520
That seems right.

16:31.520 --> 16:32.240
Hey, showtime.

16:32.240 --> 16:35.440
Uh, J-Man, one more, one more, one more question.

16:35.440 --> 16:36.400
Oh my god.

16:36.400 --> 16:37.680
This has always eaten me up

16:37.680 --> 16:40.160
and now Justin could possibly answer this for me.

16:41.280 --> 16:47.280
Is the idea of 50 Shades of Anything referenced in the book?

16:47.280 --> 16:48.960
What is the title based on?

16:49.920 --> 16:54.160
Travis, at one point he says, you can't love me.

16:54.960 --> 16:56.880
And she says, why?

16:57.600 --> 17:01.360
And he says, he stares into a window very dramatically

17:01.360 --> 17:05.040
and says, because I'm 50 shades of fucked up.

17:05.760 --> 17:09.120
And that is where the title of the book comes from.

17:09.120 --> 17:11.920
But the name of the book isn't 50 Shades of Fucked Up,

17:11.920 --> 17:14.080
which would be a way better title.

17:14.080 --> 17:17.520
That would be because you could feel when,

17:17.520 --> 17:19.360
apparently the book is, I have not read the book.

17:19.360 --> 17:22.160
Apparently the writing leaves something to be desired.

17:22.160 --> 17:24.560
But you can feel with your entire being

17:24.560 --> 17:26.640
when they have lifted a line directly from the book

17:26.640 --> 17:29.120
because it sounds like that it is written.

17:29.120 --> 17:31.760
Like the line, the first there,

17:31.760 --> 17:34.080
I think it's the masquerade scene

17:34.080 --> 17:36.480
when they sort of go away from the party

17:36.480 --> 17:38.000
and find a little bedroom.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.480
And he says, I'm gonna rump me a good one.

17:41.120 --> 17:43.280
And she laughs.

17:44.400 --> 17:49.360
That's page 169, which is funny, which is also kind of funny.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.600
The weirdest part about the movie is

17:51.600 --> 17:53.600
he only calls it porking.

17:53.600 --> 17:57.920
So every time it's like, why are you so dark and disturbed?

17:57.920 --> 18:00.000
Because I like to spank while I pork.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.040
And it's like weird.

18:01.760 --> 18:03.280
That's a weird way of putting it.

18:03.280 --> 18:04.560
So here's an actual question.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.800
I'm sorry about all the 50 Shades talk.

18:06.800 --> 18:09.040
But if you want me to watch 50 Shades 2 and talk about it.

18:09.040 --> 18:10.080
Nope.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.160
We're gonna have to do some kind of go fund me

18:12.160 --> 18:13.120
to make that happen.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.040
Maybe donate some money to charity

18:15.040 --> 18:17.600
in order to make Justin watch 50 Shades.

18:17.600 --> 18:20.000
Or maybe to make him not watch 50 Shades 2

18:20.000 --> 18:21.520
so we never have to talk about it again.

18:22.240 --> 18:23.680
I thought it was weird how in the movie

18:23.680 --> 18:27.360
every time he achieves climax, he yells toasty.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.600
Like the guy from Mortal Kombat.

18:29.600 --> 18:32.560
There's like a lot of like, it pulls from,

18:32.560 --> 18:34.720
it's kind of like Scott Pilgrim.

18:34.720 --> 18:35.920
Like he just pulls from all these different,

18:35.920 --> 18:39.600
like there's so many like references to old video games.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.200
It was originally Michael Cero,

18:41.200 --> 18:43.040
which is why they wrote the jeans in.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.640
Cause that was a request.

18:44.640 --> 18:44.880
Okay.

18:45.520 --> 18:47.920
I've been trying to clear out the back of my closet

18:47.920 --> 18:50.400
and I ran into an issue trying to deal with,

18:50.400 --> 18:58.400
well, I have these five very large posters of Orlando Bloom.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.440
One Pirates of the Caribbean,

18:59.440 --> 19:01.520
two Lord of the Rings and two Elizabeth Towns.

19:03.200 --> 19:07.040
Two fucking 24 by 68,

19:07.040 --> 19:10.560
like rip these off the side of a fucking theater

19:10.560 --> 19:12.480
Elizabeth Town promos.

19:14.160 --> 19:17.280
I've had a crush on Orlando Bloom since I was a teenager.

19:17.280 --> 19:20.960
Many years ago, I had a dedicated wall of Orlando posters

19:20.960 --> 19:22.400
and when I moved into my own apartment,

19:22.400 --> 19:23.280
they all came with me,

19:24.240 --> 19:25.680
but only two went up on the wall.

19:26.320 --> 19:27.760
Tasteful restraint.

19:27.760 --> 19:30.240
I know I can't make space for the rest,

19:30.240 --> 19:32.320
but I feel terrible about throwing them out.

19:32.320 --> 19:34.080
Should I ask my friends if they want them?

19:34.080 --> 19:34.560
They don't.

19:35.120 --> 19:36.080
Or sell them?

19:36.080 --> 19:37.040
Good luck.

19:37.040 --> 19:39.280
And that's from Closet Cleaning Canadian.

19:39.920 --> 19:41.760
Man, that's a humdinger.

19:41.760 --> 19:44.080
Thank you so much for bringing this to our attention.

19:44.080 --> 19:47.120
You've chosen wisely.

19:47.120 --> 19:50.560
You can't throw them out.

19:52.240 --> 19:53.200
His spirit is in them.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.640
His spirit, a little bit of it.

19:54.640 --> 19:55.440
Like he'll know.

19:55.440 --> 19:57.040
I feel like every time,

19:57.040 --> 19:57.920
and it doesn't happen often,

19:57.920 --> 20:00.960
but anytime folks throw away the I'm a Bim Bam poster,

20:00.960 --> 20:02.720
especially if we've signed it,

20:02.720 --> 20:06.320
we've put a piece of our essence in them.

20:06.320 --> 20:07.440
And so when you throw them away,

20:07.440 --> 20:10.000
it's like I trip and fall over

20:10.000 --> 20:12.240
and I'm like, oh man, it happened, didn't it?

20:12.240 --> 20:15.680
I'd love to do, I'd love to be there when Con Marie

20:17.280 --> 20:18.560
digs into this apartment like,

20:18.560 --> 20:20.160
I want you to touch each of these objects

20:20.160 --> 20:21.280
and tell me if they spark joy.

20:21.920 --> 20:23.120
And if not, we'll throw them away.

20:23.120 --> 20:23.600
Let me check.

20:24.240 --> 20:27.520
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

20:27.520 --> 20:28.640
They all spark joy.

20:28.640 --> 20:29.440
What else you got?

20:30.160 --> 20:33.680
Okay, if you have one, you're an Orlando Bloom fan.

20:33.680 --> 20:34.000
Fun.

20:35.040 --> 20:38.160
If you have three, it's a shrine.

20:38.960 --> 20:41.520
Like it becomes a shrine to Orlando Bloom

20:41.520 --> 20:44.240
and that has some powerful symbology.

20:44.240 --> 20:47.120
I'm not sure you wanna necessarily hit your wagon.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.960
Well, you leave him offerings

20:48.960 --> 20:53.920
of some of Bloom's favorite stuff, bows and arrows.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.600
Yeah, I'm sure he got really into that.

20:55.600 --> 20:58.800
Pictures of his friends from Lord of the Rings,

20:58.800 --> 21:01.360
like the actors, I think they're all still really good buds.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.160
He likes those.

21:02.720 --> 21:05.120
What you do is when you have friends come over,

21:05.120 --> 21:07.520
you say, if we're gonna be friends,

21:07.520 --> 21:09.200
you need to know something about me.

21:09.200 --> 21:10.880
Welcome to my play, Bloom.

21:10.880 --> 21:12.480
And then you open the door

21:12.480 --> 21:14.720
and it's just coded in your posters.

21:15.680 --> 21:17.520
This is something you need to know about me.

21:17.520 --> 21:19.200
50 posters of Orlando Bloom.

21:21.360 --> 21:22.560
Your friends are confused and you're like,

21:22.560 --> 21:23.840
what do your Elven eyes see?

21:23.840 --> 21:25.040
Come on, say it.

21:25.040 --> 21:25.840
You know the truth.

21:26.400 --> 21:27.120
These are my genes.

21:27.840 --> 21:30.400
You know what people are really into these days, fellas?

21:32.000 --> 21:34.400
Very specific museums.

21:35.360 --> 21:35.680
Okay.

21:36.480 --> 21:38.160
Somebody will like rent a storefront

21:38.160 --> 21:40.560
and like, this is my I Love Lucy museum now

21:40.560 --> 21:43.600
or this is like my Bazooka Joe gum museum

21:43.600 --> 21:46.240
or this is my Space Jam museum.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.880
Maybe you want to open up an Orlando Bloom museum

21:48.880 --> 21:52.720
because if you could start making money off of it,

21:54.640 --> 21:57.840
you can turn around to everybody who ever gave you shit

21:57.840 --> 22:01.920
about having five full-sized Orlando Bloom posters

22:01.920 --> 22:04.720
and the Big Head posters

22:04.720 --> 22:06.720
or a full-sized Orlando Bloom on your wall

22:06.720 --> 22:09.360
because now you're making money off Orlando Bloom,

22:09.360 --> 22:11.520
just like everyone else in Orlando Bloom's life.

22:12.160 --> 22:12.560
Okay.

22:12.560 --> 22:13.440
They're all taking advantage.

22:13.440 --> 22:14.400
I'm glad we've gotten to this.

22:14.400 --> 22:17.120
We're all taking advantage of Orlando Bloom all the time.

22:19.040 --> 22:22.560
If this person is willing, please get in contact with us

22:22.560 --> 22:24.880
because I will literally set you up

22:24.880 --> 22:26.880
and pay for a post office box

22:26.880 --> 22:30.160
where everybody with spare Orlando Bloom stuff

22:30.160 --> 22:31.600
can mail it to you

22:31.600 --> 22:34.160
and we can really trick this shit out.

22:34.160 --> 22:35.840
Like really get it going

22:35.840 --> 22:37.360
and make a room in your house

22:37.360 --> 22:41.120
that is a, you probably get a different tax classification

22:41.840 --> 22:44.880
for this one room that is the Orlando Bloom museum

22:44.880 --> 22:45.520
or the Bloom museum.

22:45.520 --> 22:46.400
Or church.

22:47.440 --> 22:49.120
Church, hey.

22:49.120 --> 22:52.320
We've all reached a dark and tough time in our lives

22:52.320 --> 22:54.080
where we did a little prayer to Orlando Bloom

22:54.080 --> 22:55.680
just to see if he could do anything to help out.

22:55.680 --> 22:57.280
Troy is in Troy.

22:58.160 --> 22:59.200
Yeah, got it.

23:00.400 --> 23:01.280
Got a fourth one.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.320
Hey, do you guys want to know who?

23:02.960 --> 23:03.680
Yep.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.600
Now I'm just psyching about Troy.

23:05.600 --> 23:06.640
Eric Bana?

23:06.640 --> 23:08.000
Fuck yeah, dude.

23:08.000 --> 23:08.800
Here's a Yahoo.

23:08.800 --> 23:09.300
Brad Pitt?

23:10.080 --> 23:10.580
Was he?

23:11.360 --> 23:13.920
Yeah, he plays the Achilles.

23:13.920 --> 23:15.120
He's one of the Troy boys.

23:15.680 --> 23:16.560
I have a good one.

23:16.560 --> 23:17.440
That's what they call them.

23:17.440 --> 23:19.040
I have a good one here, but it's not loading.

23:19.040 --> 23:21.440
I'm wondering if my cookies are fucked up.

23:22.160 --> 23:22.720
There we go.

23:23.520 --> 23:26.240
This one was sent in by Zoe Kinski, riding high.

23:26.240 --> 23:27.760
Yes, thank you Zoe Kinski.

23:27.760 --> 23:30.800
It's from Yahoo Answers user anonymous.

23:31.360 --> 23:33.600
It's actually from Jorlando Doom.

23:33.600 --> 23:36.720
Jorlando Doom sent this one, asked this.

23:36.720 --> 23:37.760
Jorlando Doom asks,

23:39.680 --> 23:40.720
oh, the page crashed.

23:40.720 --> 23:41.520
What does that even mean?

23:41.520 --> 23:42.400
How does a page crash?

23:42.400 --> 23:43.360
It's the internet.

23:43.360 --> 23:44.400
I didn't download it.

23:45.120 --> 23:46.880
Yahoo is closing down around you, Griffin.

23:46.880 --> 23:48.000
You have to get out.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.760
You're joking, but that is going to happen one day

23:49.760 --> 23:51.120
and y'all never see me again.

23:52.480 --> 23:53.680
Jorlando Doom asks,

23:54.320 --> 23:56.720
God, fuck this website.

23:56.720 --> 23:57.280
Seriously.

23:57.280 --> 23:57.780
Okay.

23:59.680 --> 24:01.120
Jorlando Doom asks,

24:01.120 --> 24:05.680
why does the New Year's ball drop instead of go up?

24:07.360 --> 24:09.600
This question really fucked me up when I saw it.

24:11.360 --> 24:13.520
Why does the New Year's ball drop instead of go up?

24:13.520 --> 24:16.000
And then there's the only other text here is update.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.200
Tradition, yes.

24:17.760 --> 24:19.920
Dropping balls, good answer.

24:19.920 --> 24:22.480
Update two, about the gravity response.

24:22.480 --> 24:24.240
No shit, Sherlock.

24:24.240 --> 24:26.400
So I'm not going to go too deep into the other answers

24:26.400 --> 24:27.040
that people gave,

24:27.040 --> 24:28.400
but I think somebody just said like,

24:28.400 --> 24:30.240
oh, a ball can't go up.

24:30.240 --> 24:32.880
Ball go down because of the Earth pull.

24:32.880 --> 24:33.920
Do you mean gravity?

24:35.440 --> 24:39.440
So the obvious answer here is that

24:41.040 --> 24:42.640
they couldn't get it down.

24:42.640 --> 24:45.840
Like if you raised it and that was like the thing,

24:45.840 --> 24:50.240
that's cool, except now that ball is just up there now.

24:50.240 --> 24:53.280
So you can't bring it down, you know?

24:53.280 --> 24:55.760
You can't get it because you raised it.

24:55.760 --> 24:58.400
It's not like a flag where if the ball touches the ground,

24:58.400 --> 25:00.240
the year stops or whatever.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.680
Yes, but the symbolism of like the year is here,

25:03.680 --> 25:04.960
time to raise the ball.

25:05.600 --> 25:08.400
At some point, you're going to have the reverse symbolism of,

25:08.400 --> 25:10.480
well, bring it back down, I guess.

25:10.480 --> 25:11.280
But that's how we do it.

25:11.280 --> 25:12.080
That's how we do it now.

25:12.080 --> 25:13.760
It's like, count it down.

25:13.760 --> 25:15.120
Three, two, one.

25:15.120 --> 25:17.600
Let's lower this year into the toilet,

25:17.600 --> 25:19.600
which is like where it belongs.

25:20.880 --> 25:22.240
I want to triumphant.

25:22.240 --> 25:23.280
I want to count up.

25:23.280 --> 25:24.800
This year, I want to see the ball go up

25:24.800 --> 25:27.600
and I want it to be one, two, three, four, five, six,

25:27.600 --> 25:29.200
seven, eight, nine, ten.

25:29.200 --> 25:31.040
And the ball's at the top and everyone's like,

25:31.040 --> 25:33.200
fuck yeah, look at that thing up there.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.120
Everybody can see it better now because it's higher.

25:35.840 --> 25:36.640
Go with me.

25:36.640 --> 25:38.560
I think a third option.

25:38.560 --> 25:42.080
Third option, we build two mechanical hands

25:42.640 --> 25:44.720
and we make it like a tether ball

25:44.720 --> 25:46.320
and they bat the ball around

25:46.320 --> 25:49.120
and when it's all fully wrapped around the pole,

25:49.680 --> 25:50.400
happy new year.

25:51.120 --> 25:55.120
But it is a billions of Wawrowski's crystals.

25:55.120 --> 25:56.160
And those will not hold up to-

25:56.160 --> 25:58.400
We'll make the hands crystal too, Griffin.

25:58.400 --> 26:01.200
I don't know what you want from me, all right?

26:01.200 --> 26:04.640
You can't make an omelet without breaking a few crystals.

26:04.640 --> 26:07.120
I want to shower Times Square

26:07.120 --> 26:09.040
and razor sharp Swarovski crystals

26:09.600 --> 26:11.360
to take it from the year ball.

26:12.400 --> 26:14.160
Listen, thin that crowd a little bit.

26:14.160 --> 26:15.120
It couldn't hurt, Griffin.

26:15.120 --> 26:16.320
There's too many people there.

26:16.320 --> 26:17.360
Not enough bathrooms.

26:17.360 --> 26:18.560
They're not allowed to drink.

26:18.560 --> 26:19.520
There's no food there.

26:19.520 --> 26:22.480
I've often thought that standing in Times Square

26:22.480 --> 26:25.600
for new year's must be the absolute pits.

26:25.600 --> 26:26.640
Full blown.

26:26.640 --> 26:28.480
I think the crystal hand should be controlled

26:28.480 --> 26:30.800
by Ryan Seacrest with a virtual reality helmet.

26:30.800 --> 26:31.520
Oh, yes.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.400
That would be very futuristic.

26:34.400 --> 26:35.280
That'd be very today.

26:35.280 --> 26:37.600
You would never see that on Dick Clark's show.

26:37.600 --> 26:39.120
That's how Ryan makes it his own.

26:40.080 --> 26:42.080
Where's that year ball right now, though?

26:43.120 --> 26:43.600
What do you think?

26:43.600 --> 26:44.000
It's sitting there.

26:44.640 --> 26:46.000
It's just sitting somewhere, huh?

26:46.720 --> 26:49.120
No, I'm saying like I think it's still on top of that building.

26:49.680 --> 26:50.640
Oh, shit.

26:50.640 --> 26:52.400
I mean, first of all,

26:52.400 --> 26:54.160
a heist opportunity of the century.

26:54.160 --> 26:57.760
I'm saying if you have the year ball, you got the power.

26:58.240 --> 27:00.160
And so we steal the year ball,

27:00.160 --> 27:04.080
and it's up to us how this one goes.

27:04.560 --> 27:07.040
Maybe that's what the good year blimp is all about.

27:07.040 --> 27:10.800
It's a band of blimp based thieves trying to get the year ball

27:10.800 --> 27:13.200
so that they can just improve it.

27:13.520 --> 27:15.760
What if we just take this whole shit, right?

27:15.760 --> 27:16.720
We turn it on its ear.

27:16.720 --> 27:18.560
And what we do is the ball,

27:19.760 --> 27:22.560
it raises up, right, at the beginning of the year,

27:22.560 --> 27:27.280
and then we continuously lower it when bad shit happens.

27:27.280 --> 27:30.880
And when it hits the bottom, it's time for a new year,

27:30.880 --> 27:34.480
no matter what fucking day it is, month it is, whatever.

27:34.480 --> 27:38.320
Like, well, we've used up all the goodness of the year,

27:38.320 --> 27:39.920
so time to reset.

27:39.920 --> 27:41.600
And then that's right there.

27:41.600 --> 27:43.760
That's new year, June 7th, whatever.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.120
Fucking new year, we're done.

27:45.120 --> 27:46.400
It's 2018 now.

27:46.400 --> 27:51.120
June 7th is such a fucking wildly inaccurate,

27:51.120 --> 27:53.440
like, you don't realize, Trav,

27:53.440 --> 27:55.120
if we started doing this last year,

27:55.120 --> 28:00.480
it would currently be like January 3rd, 3041,

28:00.480 --> 28:04.800
and then tomorrow would be January 1st, 3042.

28:04.800 --> 28:07.600
It would just be like, history teachers would be like,

28:07.600 --> 28:11.920
so there's this weird span of like 650 years

28:11.920 --> 28:15.600
that really took place over the course of like, well, four.

28:15.600 --> 28:18.400
And it got pretty buckwild there for a second.

28:18.400 --> 28:21.760
But anyway, yeah, that's when everybody was like 750 years old.

28:21.760 --> 28:22.720
You remember?

28:22.720 --> 28:23.760
It was really fun.

28:23.760 --> 28:25.040
It was like a fun way to do it.

28:26.800 --> 28:29.280
We were talking about Ryan Seacrest a little bit.

28:29.280 --> 28:29.680
Yes.

28:29.680 --> 28:31.360
I wanted to share a quick vignette.

28:33.040 --> 28:34.640
First, congratulations to Ryan.

28:34.640 --> 28:37.680
He's the new co-host with Kelly Ripa.

28:37.680 --> 28:38.160
So it's-

28:38.160 --> 28:39.440
Oh, permanently?

28:39.440 --> 28:40.800
Yeah, he's like the new-

28:40.800 --> 28:42.240
Yeah, he's the new guy.

28:42.240 --> 28:44.640
And they had to keep mum about it for a long time.

28:44.640 --> 28:48.560
And she had this joke where she said, in my house,

28:49.280 --> 28:50.880
we call it keeping a Seacrest,

28:51.440 --> 28:54.240
because they had to not tell anybody about it.

28:54.240 --> 28:56.160
And I just wanted to pass that on to everybody

28:56.160 --> 29:00.000
in case in your day-to-day life for, well, for the rest of it.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.240
If you want to call secrets Seacrests,

29:02.960 --> 29:04.480
I would very much approve of that.

29:04.480 --> 29:05.840
And it's something I'm going to try to implement.

29:06.400 --> 29:08.400
And I just wanted to share that with everybody

29:08.400 --> 29:10.000
that they're called Seacrests now.

29:10.800 --> 29:12.640
It's going to be tough to implement, but I'm going to do-

29:12.640 --> 29:13.280
I mean, you know me.

29:13.280 --> 29:14.960
It doesn't trip off the tongue.

29:14.960 --> 29:16.720
If you guys want to try it, it doesn't-

29:16.720 --> 29:19.520
It stumbles off the tongue, but Kelly leads and I follow.

29:20.560 --> 29:21.360
Kelly says, jump.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.120
I say, how high, Kelly Ripa?

29:23.120 --> 29:24.480
And she tells me how high to jump.

29:25.280 --> 29:26.160
Here's another question.

29:26.160 --> 29:27.920
My housemate keeps opening the fridge door

29:27.920 --> 29:31.440
and fraudulently claiming, balls, we're out of milk.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.040
He then pauses and says, ah, just joking.

29:35.920 --> 29:37.840
How do I explain to him what jokes are?

29:37.840 --> 29:39.760
That's from George from the internet.

29:39.760 --> 29:43.840
You know the one. We're out of milk.

29:44.800 --> 29:45.300
Get it?

29:46.240 --> 29:50.080
I mean, it's the exclamation balls that gives us

29:50.080 --> 29:53.920
a particularly like nutty sort of wild boys

29:54.480 --> 29:59.760
pecan flavor that I really would like an early 2000s,

29:59.760 --> 30:03.360
like some 41 sort of barf vibe that I just

30:03.360 --> 30:06.000
am like really grooving on right now.

30:06.000 --> 30:11.680
Just sort of, just sort of some, just a fucking really,

30:11.680 --> 30:12.720
really, really good.

30:14.640 --> 30:16.400
I mean, that's the, that made me laugh.

30:16.400 --> 30:17.040
I'll be honest.

30:17.040 --> 30:18.960
Yeah, it did make me laugh too.

30:18.960 --> 30:22.560
You want to put on a joke clinic, but the summoning,

30:22.560 --> 30:26.400
the conjuring of balls from the depths is like,

30:26.400 --> 30:29.280
that makes me chuckle, I think, a little bit.

30:29.280 --> 30:31.520
Yeah, because they weren't out of-

30:31.520 --> 30:33.280
Did you, Griffin, did you hear the part

30:33.280 --> 30:34.640
where they weren't out of milk?

30:34.640 --> 30:36.160
Did you hear that part of the joke?

30:37.200 --> 30:38.800
No, that's classic comedy.

30:38.800 --> 30:42.640
I was more tickled by this sort of ska curse word, balls.

30:46.960 --> 30:49.280
I guess I'm just lost in this whole thing.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.920
So there is milk?

30:52.800 --> 30:54.800
No, no, no, no, no.

30:54.800 --> 30:55.520
Oh, there is milk.

30:55.520 --> 30:56.000
Oh, there is.

30:59.200 --> 31:00.400
Now I get it.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.720
Balls, balls, dude.

31:02.720 --> 31:04.880
Balls, I got tricked.

31:04.880 --> 31:08.000
For a second, I thought that there was no milk present,

31:08.960 --> 31:09.920
and I panicked.

31:09.920 --> 31:10.800
I panicked.

31:10.800 --> 31:15.280
Honest to God, I felt my blood go cold

31:15.280 --> 31:18.480
because I was like, what do I put on my Frosted Flakes later?

31:18.480 --> 31:23.760
And I was thinking about having a mac and cheese for dinner,

31:23.760 --> 31:24.560
but not now.

31:25.440 --> 31:25.920
Not now.

31:26.960 --> 31:28.960
But then, Justin, here's the beauty of this,

31:28.960 --> 31:31.440
was not only is it fucking hilarious,

31:31.440 --> 31:37.200
but the relief I felt when I realized there is milk.

31:39.360 --> 31:41.760
I don't think that this person has thought about,

31:41.760 --> 31:44.320
one of these days, they're going to open that old fridge

31:44.320 --> 31:46.800
and there really isn't going to be milk.

31:46.800 --> 31:49.840
And they can tell whoever they want at that point.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.160
No one is going to believe it.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.560
They're going to go to the store to buy milk,

31:54.560 --> 31:57.280
and the milk butcher is going to say,

31:58.240 --> 32:00.800
no, I'm pretty sure you have milk.

32:00.800 --> 32:02.800
Nice try, but go home.

32:02.800 --> 32:04.160
The milk got your number,

32:04.160 --> 32:06.080
which is funny because you're at a butcher shop.

32:06.880 --> 32:07.360
Right.

32:07.360 --> 32:10.480
The milk butcher being the one who destroys the cows

32:10.480 --> 32:12.800
to get the sweet nectar within.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.400
There's got to be an easier way.

32:16.320 --> 32:17.120
There has to be.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.680
When you go to a really nice resort,

32:19.680 --> 32:22.240
sometimes they'll crack the cow right there in front of you,

32:22.240 --> 32:23.760
just put a straw in it,

32:23.760 --> 32:26.960
and you can just enjoy it there in your chair

32:26.960 --> 32:28.080
as you watch the waves roll in.

32:28.080 --> 32:28.880
It's amazing.

32:28.880 --> 32:29.520
Balls, dude.

32:29.520 --> 32:31.680
Can you imagine if that's how it was?

32:32.400 --> 32:32.900
Fuck.

32:33.680 --> 32:34.560
Balls, man.

32:34.560 --> 32:35.040
Balls.

32:35.040 --> 32:35.760
That's some...

32:35.760 --> 32:36.560
Oh, God.

32:36.560 --> 32:39.040
It's just like I'm there on the couch

32:39.600 --> 32:41.200
watching Viva La Bam again.

32:41.200 --> 32:42.480
Fuck yeah, dude.

32:42.480 --> 32:42.880
Balls.

32:42.880 --> 32:43.680
I'm loving it.

32:44.720 --> 32:46.000
Just saying it, man.

32:46.960 --> 32:48.160
Every once in a while,

32:48.160 --> 32:51.600
I check to see if there's going to be another jackass movie,

32:51.600 --> 32:55.200
and it always leads me down some paths of despair.

32:55.200 --> 32:59.280
It just gets worse every time I duck my head back in

32:59.280 --> 33:02.400
to see how progress is coming on Jackass 4.

33:02.400 --> 33:03.920
It gets worse and worse and worse.

33:03.920 --> 33:04.800
And at this point,

33:04.800 --> 33:06.640
I think I'm going to stop checking

33:06.640 --> 33:08.400
to see if Jackass 4 is going to happen,

33:08.400 --> 33:10.160
because I always end up very depressed.

33:10.160 --> 33:12.160
Probably better ways for time to be used.

33:13.440 --> 33:14.880
And money and everything.

33:14.880 --> 33:17.200
Hey, here's a quickie sent by Rachel Rosen.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.520
Game recognized game, Rachel Rosen.

33:19.520 --> 33:19.840
Thank you.

33:19.840 --> 33:22.080
It's Yahoo Answers user Ben who says,

33:22.080 --> 33:24.880
has there ever been a circular banana?

33:24.880 --> 33:28.560
Like, you know, how some bananas are more curly than others.

33:28.560 --> 33:31.600
Has one ever curled right around into a circle?

33:31.600 --> 33:32.400
I mean, probably.

33:33.600 --> 33:34.560
All right.

33:34.560 --> 33:36.160
Travis fruit science expert.

33:36.160 --> 33:37.840
I mean, I'm just saying that if you're talking about

33:37.840 --> 33:40.320
across the great expanse of time

33:40.320 --> 33:44.480
since like the evolution of the modern nanner,

33:44.480 --> 33:47.760
has there been a nanner that has grown into itself?

33:47.760 --> 33:48.720
I mean, probably.

33:49.760 --> 33:52.080
If you had a completely circular banana

33:52.080 --> 33:53.040
that went all the way around,

33:53.040 --> 33:58.000
you could feed everyone with it forever.

33:58.000 --> 33:58.720
Think about that.

33:58.720 --> 33:59.760
Hold up, what?

34:00.560 --> 34:01.680
It's an infinite banana.

34:01.680 --> 34:02.160
Nobody.

34:02.160 --> 34:04.080
There's no beginning and no end to the banana.

34:04.080 --> 34:06.000
So no matter how many bites you took out of it,

34:06.800 --> 34:08.240
it's still all there.

34:08.240 --> 34:09.920
Well, I see what you're saying.

34:09.920 --> 34:12.560
If I may, one step further, in order for that to happen,

34:12.560 --> 34:15.280
the banana would have to twist back in on itself

34:15.280 --> 34:16.480
like a Mobius nanner.

34:17.040 --> 34:18.400
Now, if you had a Mobius nanner,

34:18.400 --> 34:21.360
you could also have people walk on that banana

34:21.360 --> 34:23.200
and walk forever.

34:23.200 --> 34:24.400
And get real confused.

34:24.400 --> 34:25.760
Yeah, and while they're eating it.

34:25.760 --> 34:30.960
Justin, you came to my house in March

34:30.960 --> 34:32.400
and you brought your lovely family

34:32.400 --> 34:33.520
and we all had a fun time.

34:33.520 --> 34:37.680
And it wasn't just your lovely family you brought,

34:37.680 --> 34:42.960
you also brought a literal bucket of donuts

34:42.960 --> 34:44.160
from Voodoo Donuts.

34:44.160 --> 34:45.200
A big bucket.

34:45.200 --> 34:45.760
Big, big.

34:45.760 --> 34:46.960
It's not a little bucket.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.640
A 10 gallon bucket.

34:48.640 --> 34:51.840
A 10 gallon bucket, and they had donuts in them

34:51.840 --> 34:54.080
and I watched you eat a food that is a circle.

34:54.080 --> 34:56.800
So I know you understand that not all circular foods

34:56.800 --> 35:00.320
contain infinite food matter.

35:00.320 --> 35:03.200
Yeah, but bananas traditionally have a beginning and an end,

35:03.200 --> 35:03.520
right?

35:03.520 --> 35:04.960
Every banana that you've ever seen

35:04.960 --> 35:05.760
has a beginning and an end.

35:05.760 --> 35:07.280
You're talking about terminal bananas.

35:07.920 --> 35:09.600
You can either bite the beginning of the banana

35:09.600 --> 35:13.040
or the bottom of the banana if you're a goofball.

35:13.040 --> 35:14.960
I don't even know anybody that eats bananas that way

35:14.960 --> 35:15.760
except maybe monkeys.

35:15.760 --> 35:16.320
No, that's wrong.

35:16.320 --> 35:20.720
But if you have a banana that goes all the way around

35:20.720 --> 35:22.880
and I said, it just keeps going,

35:22.880 --> 35:24.320
so you could bite the top of it.

35:24.320 --> 35:25.120
There is no top.

35:25.120 --> 35:25.840
You could bite the bottom.

35:25.840 --> 35:27.040
There is no bottom.

35:27.040 --> 35:31.440
So since it is an infinite banana without beginning or end,

35:32.080 --> 35:35.680
then theoretically speaking, quantum, et cetera,

35:35.680 --> 35:36.400
et cetera, et cetera.

35:36.400 --> 35:37.360
Quantum, dude.

35:37.360 --> 35:40.560
Much like lobsters, if we didn't harvest bananas,

35:40.560 --> 35:42.880
they would just keep growing like that.

35:42.880 --> 35:44.880
Like lobsters are immortal.

35:44.880 --> 35:46.320
Everybody knows that.

35:46.320 --> 35:46.560
Yeah.

35:46.560 --> 35:50.080
Do you think bananas are immortal if we don't chop them?

35:50.080 --> 35:51.840
Man, am I right?

35:51.840 --> 35:53.440
Humans, won't we fuck up?

35:54.400 --> 35:57.600
Anyways, I want perfectly round bananas that I can...

35:57.600 --> 35:58.480
Because here's the thing.

35:59.680 --> 36:03.920
I'm going to the park to play with my friends in the grass

36:05.120 --> 36:07.680
and just sort of connect with nature

36:07.680 --> 36:09.280
and I take an apple with me.

36:09.920 --> 36:11.920
I drop the apple and of course,

36:11.920 --> 36:13.920
I'm like running in the grass because I'm having a great time

36:13.920 --> 36:16.320
and I kick the apple and it goes so far away

36:16.320 --> 36:18.000
because I just had to hold the apple in my hands.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.600
What the fuck else am I going to do with it?

36:19.600 --> 36:20.640
It's a big apple.

36:20.640 --> 36:21.920
It's a big gala apple.

36:23.040 --> 36:24.080
A banana ring.

36:24.880 --> 36:27.520
I could wear that as a tiara.

36:27.520 --> 36:31.280
I could wear that as a cool bracelet or a belt

36:31.280 --> 36:32.480
if it's fucking big enough.

36:32.480 --> 36:34.240
Like Travis said, we eat these bananas

36:34.240 --> 36:35.840
before we really give them a fair shot.

36:36.560 --> 36:41.120
So I wear this banana circlet and it's not going to fall off

36:41.120 --> 36:43.120
because I'm wearing it and it looks cool.

36:43.120 --> 36:46.400
It looks yellow and cool and banana.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.640
Not only that, Griffin, you get to the park with your friends

36:48.640 --> 36:50.960
and it's like, hey, let's play some Ultimate Frisbee

36:50.960 --> 36:52.240
like we've been talking about all week.

36:52.240 --> 36:55.280
Oh no, Steve forgot the fucking frisbee.

36:55.920 --> 36:56.560
Nanner time.

36:57.360 --> 36:58.080
Throw it.

36:58.080 --> 36:59.520
And I would be kind of passive aggressive.

36:59.520 --> 37:01.200
I would throw it so Steve would miss

37:01.200 --> 37:02.640
and so he'd look like a fucking nerd.

37:04.320 --> 37:06.080
This is the dumbest our show has ever been

37:06.080 --> 37:07.840
and I'm stopping it to go to the Money Zone.

37:07.840 --> 37:14.720
How would you even peel it if it's all over?

37:21.760 --> 37:23.040
You got a great wardrobe.

37:23.040 --> 37:23.760
You look good.

37:23.760 --> 37:27.120
You got your perfect jeans with the holes for sex.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.240
You got your banana crown.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.800
What about the things not everybody gets to see?

37:30.800 --> 37:31.200
That's right.

37:31.200 --> 37:34.400
You've been buying those store-bought underwear five packs

37:34.400 --> 37:37.920
that are basically like trash on your genitals.

37:37.920 --> 37:39.520
So congratulations.

37:39.520 --> 37:42.080
It's time to level up your genitals to me undies.

37:42.080 --> 37:44.400

37:44.400 --> 37:47.120

37:49.040 --> 37:52.320
which is a fabric three times softer than cotton.

37:52.320 --> 37:55.200
They come in a ton of different bold shades

37:55.200 --> 37:56.880
and adventurous patterns.

38:19.280 --> 38:22.080
And what do you wear over your me undies?

38:22.080 --> 38:23.440
Your blue apron.

38:23.440 --> 38:25.440
Blue apron is a micromodal fabric

38:25.440 --> 38:28.880
that protects you from all food splattering on your genitals.

38:28.880 --> 38:34.480
Food spills and splashes and knife bounces.

38:34.480 --> 38:37.520
It is an invincible fabric that will stop eight bullets.

38:38.080 --> 38:41.520
It is the golden fleece, except it's blue.

38:41.520 --> 38:42.560
It's also an apron.

38:42.560 --> 38:43.840
No, it's a food box.

38:43.840 --> 38:46.560
It's a food box full of ingredients that they send to you

38:46.560 --> 38:48.880
and then you, I guess, get the ingredient.

38:48.880 --> 38:51.120
It says right here you get the ingredients super hot

38:51.680 --> 38:54.560
and make them touch and then they turn into sauces

38:54.560 --> 38:56.800
and cooked meals and stuff.

38:56.800 --> 38:58.640
And then you taste them and they're really good.

38:58.640 --> 39:01.200
It's less than $10 per person per meal

39:01.200 --> 39:03.440
and they deliver seasonal recipes

39:03.440 --> 39:04.880
along with pre-portioned ingredients

39:04.880 --> 39:06.880
that you can use to put them together

39:06.880 --> 39:07.920
and make them touch and hot

39:07.920 --> 39:10.000
and then they turn into delicious home cooked meals.

39:10.560 --> 39:13.360
And you can choose from a variety of recipes

39:13.360 --> 39:14.960
based on what your diet is

39:14.960 --> 39:17.200
and there's new ones all the time so you don't get bored.

39:17.200 --> 39:19.520
Some of them include beef teriyaki stir fry

39:19.520 --> 39:21.520
with sugar snap peas and lime rice,

39:21.520 --> 39:22.720
baked spinach and egg flatbread

39:22.720 --> 39:24.240
with sauteed asparagus and lemon aioli,

39:24.240 --> 39:25.760
three cheese baby broccoli stromboli

39:25.760 --> 39:27.920

39:27.920 --> 39:28.720
They're all really good.

and use the computer faster,

39:40.640 --> 39:42.400
move stuff with your mind like Lucy.

39:43.760 --> 39:45.840
We got some Jumbotrons.

39:47.200 --> 39:49.280
This one is for Teagan

39:50.160 --> 39:55.440
and it's from Sarah who specifies not that Teagan and Sarah.

39:55.440 --> 39:57.920
Which, how do you know what Teagan and Sarah

39:57.920 --> 39:58.640
I was thinking of?

39:59.200 --> 40:01.040
Yeah, I wasn't thinking of the band.

40:01.040 --> 40:02.240
I might've been thinking of you.

40:02.240 --> 40:02.960
You don't know.

40:02.960 --> 40:05.520
I was thinking of you and now I feel weird

40:05.520 --> 40:07.920
because now I think maybe you are the band.

40:07.920 --> 40:09.280
I'm so confused.

40:10.880 --> 40:13.600
Okay, anyways, Teagan says,

40:13.600 --> 40:15.760
no, Sarah says to Teagan,

40:15.760 --> 40:18.400
I'm so happy to spend our four year anniversary

40:18.400 --> 40:20.560
slash Christmas 2016

40:20.560 --> 40:22.240
slash our May birthday

40:22.240 --> 40:24.080
slash our five year anniversary

40:24.080 --> 40:26.640
slash Christmas 2017 with you.

40:26.640 --> 40:27.760
Nice.

40:27.760 --> 40:29.680
You are so amazing and brave

40:29.680 --> 40:32.000
for transitioning into the woman you are.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.840
Brothers, you good, good boys

40:33.840 --> 40:36.000
make us laugh ourselves silly.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Please tell my girlfriend to stop being

40:38.000 --> 40:40.240
so silly and cute and amazing.

40:40.240 --> 40:41.840
I can't handle it.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.760
That was for either May or December.

40:44.800 --> 40:45.920
Teagan, cut it out.

40:45.920 --> 40:47.520
Teagan, fucking stop it.

40:47.520 --> 40:49.920
Yeah, what are you trying to prove?

40:50.560 --> 40:51.040
I get it.

40:51.040 --> 40:51.440
You're cute.

40:51.440 --> 40:51.920
You're amazing.

40:51.920 --> 40:53.040
You're amazing, all right?

40:53.040 --> 40:56.160
Teagan, yes, you're very brave and awesome and radical.

40:56.160 --> 40:57.200
But Sarah's sick of it.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.200
Sarah's sick of your shit.

40:59.200 --> 41:00.160
Your adorable shit.

41:01.040 --> 41:02.400
Be normal like us.

41:03.120 --> 41:04.160
We're not cute at all.

41:05.120 --> 41:06.640
Lower yourselves to Arvar.

41:08.800 --> 41:11.120
I have a message for my hobbit boyfriend, Dave.

41:11.680 --> 41:15.680
And it's from your goblin boyfriend, Alex.

41:15.680 --> 41:17.760
Oops, this isn't the adventure zone.

41:17.760 --> 41:19.760
Anyway, happy 12 year anniversary.

41:19.760 --> 41:21.840
Whoa, congratulations, Dave and Alex.

41:21.840 --> 41:23.840
If teenage us knew we'd stay together

41:23.840 --> 41:27.360
and still be enjoying D&D, sports, anime, and Pokemon,

41:27.360 --> 41:30.160
well, I think they'd be kind of horrified, actually.

41:30.160 --> 41:33.200
But adult me couldn't be happier to be living my life with you,

41:33.200 --> 41:35.440
you wonderful weirdo and sweet cinnamon roll.

41:35.440 --> 41:36.400
I love you.

41:36.400 --> 41:37.520
Aw, that's adorable.

41:37.520 --> 41:39.920
Man, two adorable messages.

41:39.920 --> 41:40.880
Very nice.

41:40.880 --> 41:42.240
I feel very fortunate.

41:42.240 --> 41:49.120
So, happy anniversary to Dave.

41:49.120 --> 41:53.040
To Dave and Alex.

41:53.040 --> 41:54.000
Takes two to tango.

41:55.600 --> 41:56.640
I wish we'd known.

41:56.640 --> 41:57.360
That's awesome, y'all.

41:57.360 --> 42:02.240
I wish we'd known things were gonna get so fucking charming

42:02.240 --> 42:03.200
here in the mind zone.

42:03.200 --> 42:04.960
And then maybe we wouldn't have spent 20 minutes

42:04.960 --> 42:06.480
talking about Dom jeans.

42:07.520 --> 42:08.640
Like I think it detracted,

42:08.640 --> 42:11.040
like this could have been our 500 days of summer episode,

42:11.040 --> 42:14.400
but instead it's sort of a weird like grind house style.

42:14.400 --> 42:17.200
Like it starts out like really raunchy and raw

42:17.200 --> 42:20.480
and a lot of talking about blue jean friction against a wiener

42:20.480 --> 42:23.680
and then it does get like really, really, really cute.

42:23.680 --> 42:25.360
Who knows what the third act will contain?

42:25.360 --> 42:26.160
Let's find out.

42:28.960 --> 42:29.920
I'm Hal Loveland.

42:29.920 --> 42:30.800
I'm Danielle Radford.

42:30.800 --> 42:31.840
I am Michael Eagle.

42:31.840 --> 42:33.440
And we are the hosts of Tights and Fights,

42:33.440 --> 42:37.200
Maximum Fund's newest podcast dedicated to all things wrestling.

42:37.200 --> 42:38.800
We'll be talking about Sasha Banks,

42:38.800 --> 42:41.040
the women's revolution, Sasha Banks,

42:41.040 --> 42:43.520
the brand split and Sasha Banks' wigs.

42:43.520 --> 42:45.840
And we'll also be talking about wrestler fashion.

42:45.840 --> 42:47.840
Some wrestlers wear too many clothes.

42:47.840 --> 42:49.680
Some wrestlers don't wear enough clothes at all.

42:49.680 --> 42:53.120
And I'll be doing impressions of all your favorite wrestlers.

42:53.120 --> 42:56.000
New episodes Thursdays on Maximum Fund

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
or wherever you get your podcasts.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.440
Oh yeah, dig it.

43:10.160 --> 43:11.360
Here is a question.

43:11.360 --> 43:13.440
I'm a regular at a local thought.

43:13.440 --> 43:16.960
Oh, okay, okay.

43:20.480 --> 43:21.920
How did you do this bad?

43:23.920 --> 43:24.800
I'm so sorry.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.360
Oh, we've done it.

43:29.680 --> 43:30.640
Say it good.

43:30.640 --> 43:30.960
Say it.

43:30.960 --> 43:31.680
Say it good.

43:32.720 --> 43:34.960
Prove that you can to me and yourself.

43:35.760 --> 43:36.880
Okay, here we go.

43:39.840 --> 43:42.080
I'm a regular at a local Thai restaurant.

43:42.080 --> 43:43.440
Okay, now that we know,

43:43.440 --> 43:44.960
now that the prestige has been revealed,

43:45.840 --> 43:46.960
you gotta understand,

43:46.960 --> 43:49.200
Justin knows about Thai,

43:49.840 --> 43:54.240
but he also reads one letter at a time sometimes.

43:54.240 --> 43:56.880
He just like runs through a sentence a letter at a time

43:56.880 --> 43:59.200
and just kind of explores the words

43:59.200 --> 44:00.800
at the same time as you hear them.

44:00.800 --> 44:02.320
It's really a fun way to do it.

44:02.320 --> 44:04.320
Whenever you all are ready for the throne,

44:04.320 --> 44:05.360
if you wanna come at the king,

44:06.160 --> 44:06.960
come take it.

44:06.960 --> 44:08.720
Come take this throne from me.

44:08.720 --> 44:10.560
It's not a throne, it's a job.

44:10.560 --> 44:11.840
And we all have different jobs.

44:11.840 --> 44:12.960
Justin, it's pronounced drone.

44:14.240 --> 44:14.480
Okay.

44:20.080 --> 44:21.600
I'm a regular at a local restaurant.

44:23.040 --> 44:25.600
What's the sort of genre of restaurant?

44:25.600 --> 44:28.640
Thai, it's a type of Asian cuisine, Thai.

44:29.840 --> 44:31.840
Whenever I overhear another patron

44:31.840 --> 44:34.000
ask the wait staff for recommendations,

44:34.000 --> 44:35.920
I fight the urge to rush over to their table.

44:35.920 --> 44:36.960
You know what I'm gonna do?

44:36.960 --> 44:37.600
Actually right now,

44:38.240 --> 44:40.640
and I think this is a big moment for our show

44:40.640 --> 44:42.080
and for me as a human being,

44:42.080 --> 44:43.680
I have to increase the text size.

44:43.680 --> 44:44.800
I think that that's the problem.

44:44.800 --> 44:45.920
Jesus God.

44:45.920 --> 44:46.960
The text isn't big enough.

44:46.960 --> 44:48.160
What were you at before?

44:48.160 --> 44:49.280
Like 12?

44:49.280 --> 44:50.880
And now you're bumping up to 14?

44:50.880 --> 44:52.960
Just like regular and then I'm-

44:52.960 --> 44:54.080
Do you need to get some readers?

44:55.520 --> 44:56.480
Maybe I need some readers.

44:56.480 --> 44:56.880
Oh, you know what?

44:56.880 --> 44:57.520
This is nice.

44:57.520 --> 44:58.080
I did it too.

44:58.080 --> 44:59.200
This is nice.

44:59.200 --> 44:59.840
It's nice, right?

44:59.840 --> 45:00.800
It's a lot easier to read.

45:00.800 --> 45:03.280
I should have been doing this a long time ago.

45:04.640 --> 45:07.920
So I'm a regular at a local Thai restaurant.

45:07.920 --> 45:09.520
Whenever I overhear another patron

45:09.520 --> 45:11.200
ask the wait staff for recommendations,

45:11.200 --> 45:13.200
I fight the urge to rush over to their table

45:13.200 --> 45:15.280
and provide them with my favorites.

45:15.280 --> 45:17.040
Should I continue to resist this urge

45:17.040 --> 45:18.640
or should I tell them what's good?

45:18.640 --> 45:20.480
That's from The Red Curry is Delicious

45:20.480 --> 45:21.520
in Cleveland, Ohio.

45:22.320 --> 45:23.680
Yeah, you should keep fighting this one.

45:23.680 --> 45:24.480
Yeah.

45:24.480 --> 45:25.520
I think on this one,

45:25.520 --> 45:27.120
that's a battle worth fighting.

45:27.120 --> 45:29.040
Yeah, so this is a hill you gotta die on,

45:29.040 --> 45:30.560
I think maybe even a little bit.

45:30.560 --> 45:34.160
To continue to not do this thing is the most you can-

45:35.200 --> 45:35.680
I can't-

45:36.720 --> 45:38.480
I can maybe count the number of times

45:38.480 --> 45:41.360
where I have wanted this service on one finger,

45:41.360 --> 45:43.200
and it was when I was in another country

45:43.200 --> 45:45.440
where I didn't speak the language even a little bit.

45:45.440 --> 45:47.200
Well, could I have used a little bit of help

45:47.920 --> 45:48.960
from a stranger friend?

45:49.760 --> 45:51.520
Otherwise, I think I'm good.

45:51.520 --> 45:54.400
I think I'm good here, I think.

45:54.400 --> 45:55.440
Especially since,

45:55.440 --> 45:57.440
and I don't mean to point out the obvious here,

45:57.440 --> 46:01.120
they are talking to an employee of that restaurant

46:01.120 --> 46:02.400
when they ask the question.

46:03.120 --> 46:03.440
Right.

46:04.160 --> 46:06.960
And it's their job to answer that question.

46:06.960 --> 46:08.480
So I think it might be covered.

46:08.480 --> 46:11.440
So I think that resisting that impulse is good.

46:11.440 --> 46:13.280
Now, that said, what you should do

46:13.760 --> 46:15.920
is when the wait staff makes a recommendation,

46:15.920 --> 46:18.400
just chuckle to yourself and shake your head no.

46:18.400 --> 46:19.200
Like,

46:19.200 --> 46:23.360
all right, that's totally cool.

46:23.360 --> 46:24.160
There's nothing wrong with it.

46:24.160 --> 46:26.000
And then, it's important you follow that up

46:26.000 --> 46:27.760
with when you get your red curry,

46:27.760 --> 46:29.360
you eat it and you're just like,

46:29.360 --> 46:34.240
oh, balls, I'm loving it.

46:34.240 --> 46:38.400
I'm loving it, yummy, yum, yum, yum, red curry.

46:38.400 --> 46:39.920
I'll have what I'm having.

46:43.680 --> 46:46.720
I feel like I feel when I have sex sometimes

46:46.720 --> 46:48.960
at the end of it, you know what it's called.

46:48.960 --> 46:49.440
I don't.

46:50.320 --> 46:51.360
At the end of the meal,

46:51.360 --> 46:53.120
save one spoonful of your red curry

46:53.120 --> 46:54.480
as you're walking out the door,

46:54.480 --> 46:56.240
slip the spoon into the person's mouth

46:56.240 --> 46:57.360
and whisper in their ear,

46:57.360 --> 46:59.520
you fucked up, and then walk out.

46:59.520 --> 47:00.800
While they're talking.

47:00.800 --> 47:01.680
So it's just like, yeah,

47:01.680 --> 47:03.280
so Jeremy walks out of the break room

47:03.280 --> 47:06.080
and I'm like, I fucked up.

47:06.080 --> 47:07.680
That was amazing.

47:07.680 --> 47:08.400
What have I done?

47:08.960 --> 47:10.480
Got these stupid noodles, fuck.

47:11.120 --> 47:12.480
And they just hand him a piece of paper

47:12.480 --> 47:14.160
with a black spot on it and they'll know.

47:14.800 --> 47:15.440
They'll know.

47:15.440 --> 47:17.520
It's with a bloody handprint.

47:17.520 --> 47:19.200
They know, but it's not blood.

47:19.200 --> 47:20.320
It's red curry.

47:21.120 --> 47:22.480
I should have got what he said.

47:22.480 --> 47:25.120
He said he came when he ate this.

47:26.400 --> 47:27.920
It made him feel like sex time.

47:28.480 --> 47:29.600
That's what he said.

47:29.600 --> 47:30.560
That's what he said.

47:30.560 --> 47:33.200
How are your pad thai?

47:33.200 --> 47:33.920
It was pretty good.

47:33.920 --> 47:36.240
I definitely didn't cum like that dude,

47:36.800 --> 47:39.120
which is like, shoot.

47:39.680 --> 47:40.480
I mean, don't get me wrong.

47:40.480 --> 47:41.440
I gotta go, but it's lunch.

47:41.440 --> 47:42.160
I gotta go back to work.

47:42.160 --> 47:45.840
I can't go back to work with creamy Dom jeans,

47:45.840 --> 47:48.720
but shoot, it sounds like it was a revelation.

47:48.720 --> 47:49.120
Damn it.

47:50.240 --> 47:50.560
Damn.

47:51.200 --> 47:53.040
Wish she'd said something before.

47:54.240 --> 47:55.840
Is there any, let me ask you boys this.

47:55.840 --> 47:57.680
Is there, you've made your feelings clear

47:57.680 --> 48:00.320
about receiving the service in a restaurant.

48:00.320 --> 48:03.920
I think the problem, and stop me if I'm out of line,

48:03.920 --> 48:07.520
but I think the problem with doing this in a restaurant

48:07.520 --> 48:09.200
is that, and it's odd if you think about it,

48:09.200 --> 48:12.320
but when we have tables at a place,

48:12.320 --> 48:16.880
we all feel like that's our sort of island.

48:16.880 --> 48:18.960
That's our, like the other tables aren't there

48:18.960 --> 48:20.480
and we're all pretending that there aren't tables,

48:20.480 --> 48:22.400
but like, this is our territory.

48:22.400 --> 48:23.600
Like we've staked this out.

48:23.600 --> 48:25.120
You don't do that at Best Buy.

48:25.120 --> 48:27.520
If someone crosses your path when you're looking at TVs

48:27.520 --> 48:29.040
to also look at TVs,

48:29.040 --> 48:31.360
you don't get like weirdly territorial about it.

48:31.360 --> 48:32.560
It's just as the restaurant,

48:32.560 --> 48:35.120
you feel like you're renting that space for that moment,

48:35.120 --> 48:37.360
which is why I don't approve of community tables,

48:37.360 --> 48:37.840
by the way.

48:37.840 --> 48:38.720
Thank you.

48:38.720 --> 48:40.160
Thank you very much.

48:40.160 --> 48:40.640
No, thanks.

48:41.200 --> 48:41.920
But here's my question.

48:41.920 --> 48:46.240
Is there a business in which you would appreciate this service?

48:46.240 --> 48:49.040
Is there a business in which you would want someone

48:49.040 --> 48:53.120
to just kind of swoop in and drop some some records?

48:53.120 --> 48:55.920
You know, J-Man, to that point, no joke,

48:55.920 --> 48:58.000
if it was a counter service thing,

48:58.000 --> 49:01.120
because Teresa and I, when we went to Scotland,

49:01.120 --> 49:03.760
once again, different country, not quite the same.

49:03.760 --> 49:06.800
We do speak the language, but standing at the counter,

49:06.800 --> 49:10.640
first day there, wasn't sure like what to do,

49:10.640 --> 49:12.720
what social customs were different.

49:13.280 --> 49:16.640
Very nice, slightly older than us couple,

49:16.640 --> 49:18.320
kind of saw our hesitation was like,

49:18.320 --> 49:19.280
is this your first time here?

49:19.280 --> 49:19.760
And we're like, yeah.

49:19.760 --> 49:21.520
I'm like, all right, here's what you need to do.

49:21.520 --> 49:24.000
And they walked us through like where to go to order

49:24.000 --> 49:25.920
and like what drinks we should try.

49:25.920 --> 49:27.040
And that was very helpful.

49:27.040 --> 49:28.720
So counter service?

49:28.720 --> 49:30.640
Don't ever walk up to somebody's table.

49:30.640 --> 49:31.840
I think you are right.

49:31.840 --> 49:33.920
But if you see someone standing on a counter going,

49:33.920 --> 49:35.360
I just don't know what to get.

49:35.360 --> 49:37.360
I think then you can make the reckon.

49:37.360 --> 49:38.000
Keep walking.

49:39.360 --> 49:43.040
Yeah, it only happened to me once.

49:43.040 --> 49:46.080
It was also an older couple when we were in Tokyo.

49:46.080 --> 49:50.400
We were in this like huge food mall that was like underground.

49:51.120 --> 49:52.400
I'm making it sound like it was a cave.

49:52.400 --> 49:55.040
It was just like in the basement of like a shopping mall

49:55.040 --> 49:55.600
or whatever.

49:55.600 --> 49:57.360
And there were like a billion food options and this older

49:57.360 --> 49:58.800
couple was like, you want this?

49:58.800 --> 50:00.160
And we were like, all right.

50:00.160 --> 50:02.080
And we did want this very much.

50:02.080 --> 50:04.480
And they talked about how much it made them come over and over

50:04.480 --> 50:07.360
and over and over and over and over and over again.

50:07.360 --> 50:11.280
I went to this new Brazilian steakhouse that got in Charleston

50:11.280 --> 50:13.520
and I've never been to a restaurant like that before.

50:13.520 --> 50:16.800
And there were definitely some like I didn't,

50:16.800 --> 50:18.560
it was terrifying because I didn't,

50:18.560 --> 50:23.680
the person gave me a list of meat and then left and didn't

50:23.680 --> 50:26.800
come back to tell me what, ask what meat I wanted.

50:26.800 --> 50:27.600
Irresponsible.

50:28.320 --> 50:31.440
And I waited and waited and waited and just sort of like

50:31.440 --> 50:35.280
looked sadly as people were getting meat and we weren't.

50:35.280 --> 50:38.960
And it turned out there was this like device.

50:38.960 --> 50:42.240
There was a device on the table that indicated whether or not

50:42.240 --> 50:43.120
we were ready for meat.

50:43.680 --> 50:46.080
And that information was not relayed to me, by the way,

50:46.080 --> 50:49.440
which seems to me the biggest faux pas you could make in this

50:49.440 --> 50:53.360
venue because like, that's how I get it.

50:53.360 --> 50:54.400
Why didn't you tell me that?

50:54.960 --> 51:00.320
Every time I go somewhere new, I am terrified that I will

51:00.320 --> 51:04.720
misunderstand a fundamental process that exists in that place.

51:04.720 --> 51:06.720
Like I'll sit down at a table and it's like, no, no,

51:06.720 --> 51:09.360
you order from the bar or I'll go to the bar and they're like,

51:09.360 --> 51:11.760
we have servers, just go sit down at the table.

51:11.760 --> 51:15.040
So I would say in that circumstance, having like,

51:15.040 --> 51:18.000
if you see somebody like milling around and doing that thing

51:18.000 --> 51:21.680
that we humans do when we're really feeling dumb of that,

51:21.680 --> 51:24.640
like kind of body posture.

51:24.640 --> 51:26.320
I think in that circumstance, if you want to be like,

51:26.320 --> 51:29.440
oh yeah, you just sit down and come right to the table and

51:29.440 --> 51:31.760
you just flip it over so that it's green on top and then

51:31.760 --> 51:32.800
they know you want meat.

51:32.800 --> 51:34.400
I think that's totally cool.

51:34.400 --> 51:37.920
And in fact, when people do that for me, I feel like they're

51:37.920 --> 51:40.400
angels sent from God.

51:40.400 --> 51:43.200
And that's Roma Downey just like, Travis, you feel very

51:43.200 --> 51:44.000
stupid in this moment.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.040
I'm like, I do, Roma Downey.

51:45.040 --> 51:45.920
Thank you very much.

51:45.920 --> 51:48.960
And she's like, oh, you just put your money, you pay right

51:48.960 --> 51:49.600
up there at the front.

51:49.600 --> 51:51.040
I'm like, oh, Roma Downey, thanks so much.

51:51.040 --> 51:51.840
Good Roma.

51:51.840 --> 51:52.400
Hey, thanks.

51:52.400 --> 51:53.200
It's a good Roma.

51:53.200 --> 51:53.840
Killer Roma.

51:53.840 --> 51:56.640
Well, what I do when I do assets is I just mumble a lot.

51:56.640 --> 51:59.680
This Yahoo was sent in by Zoe Kinski, riding high.

51:59.680 --> 51:59.920
Thank you.

51:59.920 --> 52:01.920
Climbing that ladder and riding high on it.

52:01.920 --> 52:02.720
Thank you, Zoe Kinski.

52:02.720 --> 52:04.240
It's Yahoo Answers user.

52:04.240 --> 52:08.240
Victoria Sparta, who asks, need help ASAP?

52:09.120 --> 52:12.080
My rear end is glued to my office chair due to a

52:12.080 --> 52:12.960
super glue prank.

52:13.760 --> 52:14.260
Yes.

52:15.200 --> 52:15.600
Yes.

52:15.600 --> 52:16.240
Not.

52:16.240 --> 52:17.040
Yes.

52:17.040 --> 52:18.720
Justin, how could you?

52:18.720 --> 52:19.520
I didn't.

52:19.520 --> 52:19.920
Yes.

52:19.920 --> 52:20.880
It didn't happen.

52:20.880 --> 52:21.520
Give me this.

52:21.520 --> 52:22.640
Let me read to you.

52:22.640 --> 52:24.960
And you're going to feel like a real jag.

52:25.520 --> 52:26.080
Didn't happen.

52:26.640 --> 52:30.240
A real judge advocate general for your doubting, because the

52:30.240 --> 52:32.800
extra details I think are going to satisfy you.

52:33.840 --> 52:37.040
Yes, my butt right now glued to the office chair.

52:37.040 --> 52:41.840
My fiance and I have a prank war going on right now.

52:41.840 --> 52:42.720
He got me good.

52:42.720 --> 52:43.360
I admit it.

52:43.360 --> 52:44.640
But I will get him back.

52:44.640 --> 52:49.200
So with the exception of nail polish remover, don't have any.

52:49.200 --> 52:51.520
What could unstick my skin from this chair?

52:51.520 --> 52:53.520
He coded the whole dang seat.

52:53.520 --> 52:54.160
Plus help.

52:54.720 --> 52:57.120
I'm honestly stuck to this chair right now.

52:57.120 --> 52:59.280
1100 exclamation points.

52:59.280 --> 53:00.000
Griffin.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.280
Wait, wait, wait.

53:02.080 --> 53:02.580
Skin?

53:03.920 --> 53:07.440
Travis, that is located in update six.

53:07.440 --> 53:08.880
The six codex.

53:08.880 --> 53:10.080
So I'll get there.

53:10.080 --> 53:10.640
Please help.

53:10.640 --> 53:12.480
I'm honestly stuck to this chair right now.

53:12.480 --> 53:14.720
Justin, you fucking doubting Thomas.

53:15.600 --> 53:17.120
I know this is the wrong section.

53:17.120 --> 53:21.120
This is in social science gender studies, but I know this

53:21.120 --> 53:22.480
section is active right now.

53:22.480 --> 53:23.520
Thus why I put it here.

53:23.520 --> 53:25.360
Because this is kind of a real time issue.

53:25.920 --> 53:26.400
Update.

53:26.400 --> 53:27.360
I wish I was kidding.

53:27.360 --> 53:29.440
He put super glue on my chair.

53:29.440 --> 53:30.080
Update two.

53:30.080 --> 53:31.760
We have a prank war going on.

53:31.760 --> 53:33.280
Thus, this is the current result.

53:33.280 --> 53:33.920
Update three.

53:33.920 --> 53:34.400
All right.

53:34.400 --> 53:36.560
I know y'all are used to weird questions from some people who

53:36.560 --> 53:37.600
are just bored and messing around.

53:37.600 --> 53:40.320
But sadly, this is not one of those questions, Justin.

53:40.320 --> 53:41.360
You piece of shit.

53:41.360 --> 53:43.680
This is no trolling or anything, Justin asshole.

53:43.680 --> 53:45.920
So my rear end is stuck to the chair.

53:45.920 --> 53:48.560
Update four, when I say office chair, I meant my home office

53:48.560 --> 53:48.800
chair.

53:48.800 --> 53:50.240
It's only me and him at the house.

53:50.240 --> 53:53.120
He's laughing his head off and refusing to help me.

53:53.120 --> 53:53.680
Update five.

53:54.240 --> 53:55.760
Let's just say I'm wearing a skirt.

53:56.800 --> 53:59.040
Hints answering I think why the skin is on the chair.

53:59.040 --> 53:59.680
Update six.

53:59.680 --> 54:01.520
Oh, I found my pocket knife on the desk.

54:01.520 --> 54:03.280
I hate to ruin a chair, but it looks like I have to cut the

54:03.280 --> 54:05.280
chair fabric in order to be able to get up and soak in the

54:05.280 --> 54:06.560
tub till the rest comes off.

54:06.560 --> 54:07.680
Man, this sucks.

54:08.560 --> 54:09.200
Balls.

54:09.840 --> 54:11.360
My skin's stuck to the chair.

54:11.360 --> 54:13.520
My fiance got me great.

54:13.520 --> 54:17.520
Now, but but I if you want you Travis, if what you have to

54:17.520 --> 54:19.520
say is not going to help this person out of this fucking

54:19.520 --> 54:20.640
horrible situation.

54:20.640 --> 54:22.000
I literally don't want to hear it.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.840
No, I actually don't want to hear it.

54:23.840 --> 54:25.920
I guess I just have two questions, they help me

54:25.920 --> 54:31.040
understand so that I can CSI the issue to figure out the

54:31.040 --> 54:32.000
solution.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.360
And that is question number one.

54:35.040 --> 54:38.480
I understand that this person says they're wearing a skirt.

54:38.480 --> 54:41.680
How much super glue was put onto this seat?

54:41.680 --> 54:43.920
Soaked through.

54:43.920 --> 54:44.720
Soaked all the way through.

54:45.520 --> 54:46.240
Second question.

54:46.800 --> 54:50.080
How I guess this is the most important question that I have.

54:50.640 --> 54:57.200
How quickly between application of super glue to seat and you

54:57.200 --> 54:57.920
sitting down.

54:58.560 --> 55:01.440
Did your fiance apply that super?

55:01.440 --> 55:03.840
Was it like they saw you going to sit down and we're like?

55:04.880 --> 55:06.880
Oh, that's true because it gets tacky real quick.

55:06.880 --> 55:07.380
Yeah.

55:08.160 --> 55:10.160
I mean, this whole thing's pretty tacky.

55:10.160 --> 55:12.240
This is a prank war they're embroiled in.

55:12.240 --> 55:15.280
They obviously know how to do this type of stuff.

55:15.280 --> 55:18.720
And Travis, that was a minute and a half where you could have

55:18.720 --> 55:21.920
said something to help this person out of time losses.

55:22.560 --> 55:25.360
But loss like this person is going to lose a lot of but

55:25.360 --> 55:26.880
matter at this point.

55:26.880 --> 55:28.560
Griffin, I don't think they are.

55:32.960 --> 55:34.720
I don't think this happened.

55:34.720 --> 55:35.600
I'm sorry.

55:35.600 --> 55:39.840
I'm so sorry, but there's six fucking updates.

55:39.840 --> 55:42.960
This couple loves each other so much and they definitely have

55:42.960 --> 55:45.680
a YouTube channel where they just sort of get each like they

55:45.680 --> 55:49.360
fucking just fucking get each other all the time.

55:49.360 --> 55:50.720
And this is the latest one.

55:50.720 --> 55:52.880
And I don't understand why you won't help this person out

55:52.880 --> 55:55.120
because it can be fun and flirty.

55:55.120 --> 55:56.640
This is my 50 shades.

55:57.360 --> 55:58.960
Your 50 shades is pranks.

55:58.960 --> 56:00.480
50 shades of pranks.

56:00.480 --> 56:01.200
I got you.

56:01.760 --> 56:02.800
I got you this time.

56:02.800 --> 56:07.440
I put a bucket of water up on the door sill and you open it

56:07.440 --> 56:08.640
up and you got splashed.

56:08.640 --> 56:11.440
Oh, yes.

56:14.640 --> 56:18.320
I put that you put the fucking sugar on your grapefruit to

56:18.320 --> 56:20.720
eat it for breakfast, but it was all salt.

56:26.080 --> 56:27.200
There's no milk.

56:27.200 --> 56:28.000
Wait, there is.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.240
Thank you so much for listening to our show.

56:36.240 --> 56:40.320
I want to play more in this space, though, closing the door

56:40.320 --> 56:41.520
to the playroom.

56:41.520 --> 56:43.840
Unfortunately, I'm going to stay in the playroom.

56:43.840 --> 56:45.520
We're going to be in two different rooms for the end of

56:45.520 --> 56:48.560
this fucking trap you in there with jokes.

56:48.560 --> 56:50.480
I'm going to go.

56:50.480 --> 56:53.200
I'm going to leave the area.

56:53.200 --> 56:54.560
I'm in the fucking playroom now.

57:02.400 --> 57:05.120
This is a thematically consistent episode, which I

57:05.120 --> 57:05.920
always really enjoy.

57:05.920 --> 57:06.640
I love this.

57:07.760 --> 57:10.960
And thank you for listening to our program to the second

57:10.960 --> 57:14.080
straight episode where Griffin is absent for the ending of it,

57:14.800 --> 57:16.160
which is unusual.

57:17.040 --> 57:18.400
But thank you for listening.

57:18.400 --> 57:20.800
Thank you to sorry.

57:20.800 --> 57:23.200
John Rodgers, the long winners for the use of theme song.

57:23.200 --> 57:26.000
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

57:27.280 --> 57:28.160
Trav, were you going to say something?

57:28.160 --> 57:30.560
I was going to say thank you to our friends at Cirque du Soleil

57:30.560 --> 57:34.400
for acting as the go between the mediators between Griffin

57:34.400 --> 57:37.760
and Criss Angel so that Griffin could get his being back.

57:38.320 --> 57:40.560
I told a lot of really great jokes in the playroom when you

57:40.560 --> 57:41.200
guys weren't there.

57:41.200 --> 57:41.920
It's a shame.

57:41.920 --> 57:44.000
I should have brought my Mike jokes got to hear him.

57:44.000 --> 57:44.880
That's the important thing.

57:45.920 --> 57:48.800
If if you all can think of a collaboration we could do with

57:48.800 --> 57:51.120
Cirque, because I think they would love to work with us and

57:51.120 --> 57:52.560
we'd love to work with them.

57:52.560 --> 57:53.920
Are you talking about the Criss Angel?

57:53.920 --> 57:54.800
The Criss Angel tweet.

57:54.800 --> 57:56.800
I do want to say on the subject that I've had a lot of people

57:57.440 --> 58:00.160
when they saw that Cirque du Soleil really signal boosted

58:00.160 --> 58:01.760
sort of my whole drama.

58:01.760 --> 58:04.080
I did just want to say every night when I go to sleep, I just

58:04.080 --> 58:08.240
see one big eye and there's not really a traditional pupil in

58:08.240 --> 58:08.480
there.

58:08.480 --> 58:10.640
It's just sort of like a big like black hole.

58:10.640 --> 58:14.160
And I guess that is I like, I guess it is Criss and he's in

58:14.160 --> 58:15.040
there or whatever.

58:15.840 --> 58:16.080

58:38.720 --> 58:40.080

58:51.440 --> 58:53.760
And yeah, I always think that's a lot.

58:53.760 --> 58:55.840
Always lots of yachts a lot.

58:55.840 --> 58:58.080

59:09.680 --> 59:09.920
All right.

59:09.920 --> 59:12.960
I'll use that as a search term and I'll search Balboa and

59:12.960 --> 59:22.160
submissive and see what I turn up Balboa on Friday and

59:22.160 --> 59:23.680
Saturday night at 10 p.m.

59:23.680 --> 59:26.000
So Friday will be.

59:26.000 --> 59:26.480
Oh, my God.

59:27.200 --> 59:31.200
I believe the first one is Adventure Zone.

59:31.200 --> 59:34.080
Taz always first, because it makes me very scared to do that

59:34.080 --> 59:34.320
one.

59:34.320 --> 59:34.640
Yeah.

59:34.640 --> 59:38.640
So Taz on Friday, my bim bam on Saturday, 10 p.m.

59:38.640 --> 59:39.520
at the Balboa.

59:42.240 --> 59:45.600
Trav, are you going to make can you make links for tickets?

59:45.600 --> 59:46.400
Sure will.

59:47.360 --> 59:48.160
Call the shot.

59:48.160 --> 59:48.960
Call the shot now.

59:49.760 --> 59:55.360
We'll say Taz SDCC and MBMBAM.

59:55.360 --> 01:00:02.480
So bit.ly forward slash Taz SDCC and bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.240
SDCC all lowercase.

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:08.640
Now, those tickets will go on sale if and if you you know,

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:09.920
we're not joking when we say this.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.440
Tickets for our shows tend to sell out really quickly and we

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:16.800
want everybody to be able to come on sales for both shows.

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:21.120
We'll start at noon Pacific on Wednesday, May 17th.

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.400
That's three p.m.

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.440
Eastern Standard Time.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:26.560
Or is it EDT yet?

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.360
No one quite knows.

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:28.880
No one can keep those straight.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:34.320
But either way, it's it's noon Pacific, three p.m.

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:37.280
Eastern, Wednesday, May 17th.

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:45.840
And those links again, Travis, are bit.ly forward slash Taz SDCC

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:51.200
and bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM SDCC.

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:54.160
Okay, it's gonna be fun as fuck.

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.360
Spider-Man's gonna be there.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:57.360
We invited him.

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.440
We hope to get him out there.

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:03.280
We're gonna have the trailer for Star Wars, episode four.

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.760
We're gonna have that out.

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.200
You'll be able to check that.

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:09.360
If you know a famous person that's gonna be there, ask if

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.040
they'll come to our show, please.

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:18.400
What if we got that super old man that they let in all the

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.600
comic movies for some reason who does the one line and he

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.080
showed up and he said like something like he could walk on

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.240
and he could be like a PA and like we wouldn't even make a

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.520
big deal out of it.

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.320
That'd be amazing.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.360
What's his deal?

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:29.840
Like what?

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:32.160
It's always like I think he's somebody's dad.

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.840
I think he's Joss Whedon's dad or something.

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:34.640
There he is again.

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:36.400
There he is again.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.600
This time he's a janitor.

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.280
You never know where you're gonna stay.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:42.640
I'm always it's hard for me to enjoy those movies anymore

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.480
because like I just don't pay attention to the plot because

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:47.120
I'm fucking just scouring the background looking for that

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.400
like old guy.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:51.200
You know Griffin I actually read that they don't like cast

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.480
him or schedule that or anything.

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:54.560
He just keeps showing up and then when they go back for the

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:57.040
edits it's like fuck there he is again.

01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:57.760
Get it again.

01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:59.200
That's sweet though.

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.520
That's sweet though that they let him like be a part of it.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:06.240
Anyway come to those shows.

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:08.800
Please get tickets when they go on sale so you don't miss out.

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.480
We would love to see everybody there.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:14.880
I know there's a lot of things competing for your time there

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.200
but hopefully like I don't know 10 p.m.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.960
So there's probably it's probably not open anymore.

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:20.160
You can't go see Spider-Man.

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.520
So might as well come see him at our show.

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:24.480
Our show's at 10 p.m.?

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:24.880
Yeah.

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:25.680
Magic hour.

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:30.320
Shit during STCC Griffin goes till like fucking four or five

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:30.640
in the morning.

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:32.160
Some people just don't sleep.

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:34.960
That's midnight for me.

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:37.760
My time zone and how I do things.

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:39.360
It will be a very sleepy set.

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:40.640
Nah it's gonna be a party set.

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:41.200
No it's not.

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.400
It's gonna be weird.

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.440
It'll just get weirder.

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.440
So come out and see those shows.

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:47.440
And Griffin do you have a final Yahoo voice?

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:47.920
