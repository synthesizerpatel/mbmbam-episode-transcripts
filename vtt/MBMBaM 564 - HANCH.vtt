WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.740 --> 00:50.020
It's better it's better with you

00:53.940 --> 00:56.020
It's better it's better with you

01:00.260 --> 01:02.260
Better it's better

01:10.260 --> 01:16.140
Hello everybody welcome to my brother my brother and me vice show for the modular. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

01:16.140 --> 01:20.660
I'm your middle is brother big dog woof woof. I got please

01:21.540 --> 01:26.140
Travis McElroy, and I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy

01:26.140 --> 01:30.380
So this is a segment we like to do every episode where we ask Travis has repeat

01:31.060 --> 01:38.420
My penis is fine. This is it's my scrotum that I'm doing this we do it. Hey, hey boys we doing this

01:38.740 --> 01:42.380
Yes, the thing it's a it's a great. It's a fan favorite bit. Yeah

01:42.380 --> 01:46.740
It's great, and we can only do it. I mean God willing in the creek don't rise

01:47.500 --> 01:50.740
We can only do it one more time. Yeah, got myself a vasectomy

01:51.380 --> 01:55.740
Yeah, and just you know I'm not so plugged into so she but juice

01:55.740 --> 02:01.460
What was the response like when you talked at length about your sort wow actually so funny? You said that very good

02:02.220 --> 02:06.780
Positive yeah good and positive there were people like I don't want to hear about this dude's hog

02:06.780 --> 02:09.380
I want to hear him joke about fast-food franchise

02:09.380 --> 02:14.340
Well Griffin the vasectomy doesn't focus on the hog primarily it focuses more on

02:15.020 --> 02:18.060
The the beans as it were focuses on the buns

02:18.740 --> 02:24.900
Focuses on the meatballs. I like to think of it all is the hog. Oh, okay, okay?

02:25.020 --> 02:31.380
It's a holistic hog time down there, and I'm here's the thing travel. I'm your brother

02:31.380 --> 02:34.500
I love you, and I'm very concerned about your well-being. I'm excited about your

02:34.500 --> 02:40.580
your your your impotence and all that jazz, but even I don't feel that way doesn't even even I

02:41.300 --> 02:44.140
Even I kind of don't want to hear about it

02:44.140 --> 02:46.140
I'm you're not supporting me in this time

02:46.220 --> 02:52.980
When I need when I need you the most Griffin that I've ever needed you in my entire life to just say yes to the dress

02:53.220 --> 02:56.180
You're saying no, and yeah

02:56.660 --> 03:01.940
Yeah, can I ask so I've had it so Trav if if I can walk

03:01.940 --> 03:08.820
I'm in like a supportive place with you. Thank you. How did it? How did it go? How did the whole thing go mostly went fine?

03:09.620 --> 03:13.940
There was one weird thing. I don't know how you dealt with this Justin

03:14.220 --> 03:21.340
Yeah, the doctor just kept saying wow what a radical scrote, and yeah, yeah, that was a

03:22.220 --> 03:25.780
Flattering I guess but like I kind of wanted him to focus up

03:25.780 --> 03:32.420
Hey, it was the use. It's the use of the word radical that makes me think that maybe this was not a licensed medical

03:32.740 --> 03:36.020
Professional and maybe some sort of surf surf, dude

03:36.140 --> 03:41.420
Well sometimes you would just walk under his breath like that's just such a cool sack

03:41.780 --> 03:45.660
You know what I mean and like that was yeah nice, but like I

03:46.660 --> 03:50.100
Expected it to be a little less and for lack of a better word clinical

03:50.500 --> 03:54.300
Yeah, I I've listened to you talk about this for a few minutes now

03:54.300 --> 03:56.600
I wanted to give you a little bit of rope, but it seems like

03:57.900 --> 03:59.900
You're lying, and that's fine

04:00.060 --> 04:06.220
No, there's humor to be found in that but I am gonna go ahead and assume from your lies from the fact that you've cooked

04:06.220 --> 04:10.300
Up a fabricated thing did it the whole thing wasn't very funny. No no

04:11.180 --> 04:16.140
It wasn't very funny, and I feel like maybe you were going in hoping it would be a gut-buster

04:16.180 --> 04:18.180
and maybe it was just sort of a

04:18.460 --> 04:22.660
You know an overall success and fun for everybody, okay?

04:22.660 --> 04:30.260
I'll be honest now it was uh it was not bad the only part that really like hurt hurt was honestly

04:30.940 --> 04:38.100
He like balls. Yeah, well now he's taped he taped my penis up out of the way, so we can get in the way

04:38.100 --> 04:40.100
Get out of there

04:42.020 --> 04:44.020
When he took the tape

04:45.540 --> 04:50.980
For me and when he took the tape off it pulled off it pulled off a lot of chest hair, and that really

04:50.980 --> 04:52.980
Wasn't a problem for me at all

05:02.260 --> 05:07.180
Fuck it's all good stuff. It's all good stuff. Just fun regular conversation now

05:07.180 --> 05:10.980
I brothers I do find that I've spent the last 48 hours

05:11.820 --> 05:16.540
Thinking more about my own genitals than I did in all of my teen years put together

05:16.540 --> 05:21.580
Hey same same for me, but for you because you keep telling us about him

05:21.580 --> 05:28.460
You keep a dad keeps asking dad every four hours wants to check in on how my downstairs is doing. He's a caring father

05:30.180 --> 05:33.020
But he keeps saying how's your radical scrote, and I don't know

05:34.820 --> 05:36.980
When I check in I say how are you feeling

05:36.980 --> 05:43.640
But I don't say tell me about the tell me about the incision site on your delicate bathing suit area

05:43.640 --> 05:46.540
Because I love you, but that's your private place

05:46.900 --> 05:51.500
That's your private sound and here's the thing is he said mine was the least delicate. He's ever seen

05:51.500 --> 05:54.520
He said it was like toughened leather trying to get through there, man

05:54.980 --> 05:59.940
You got a cool juice you kept saying he didn't do that with me. Did you guys have the same guy?

06:00.780 --> 06:06.880
There's only one guy in the tri-state area who like gets it just one regular normal guy

06:06.880 --> 06:14.160
Okay, he travels the world kind of a reverse Johnny Appleseed really yeah, hey

06:14.160 --> 06:18.640
What was that? Well just a little soundbite of on the wings of love. Yeah, that's why

06:19.160 --> 06:23.900
Comcast is trying to call me. They'll never read me down. Is that special ringtone Justin?

06:23.900 --> 06:28.160
They said were you using your data to hear things about your brother's testicles?

06:29.000 --> 06:35.200
Cuz we're monitoring the whole thing. The doctor kept calling him besticles. He said these are the besticles

06:35.200 --> 06:38.640
And I was all right, and that was interesting to me. All right

06:38.640 --> 06:45.080
So it wasn't funny. I'm sorry to hear. He asked if he could do a charcoal drawing and frame it and hang it up

06:45.080 --> 06:48.120
Yeah, his personal home. Yeah, that was nice

06:49.120 --> 06:53.120
I'm starting to think he didn't even get a vasectomy. No

06:53.640 --> 06:59.860
No, no. No, I'm sure I'm sure he did, but I just don't think any funny happened and he was disappointed

06:59.860 --> 07:05.540
Griffin I can send you a picture. Griffin I'll send you a picture to prove it. No, we don't need to do that

07:05.540 --> 07:09.740
This is a kind of jackass style. This isn't like one of those jackasses

07:09.740 --> 07:16.700
That would be weird if now like jackass started up again, but it was just like oh man. Yeah, I got an actual like

07:17.580 --> 07:24.520
Prostate exam and it wasn't funny. But here here's my test results. And yeah, they are they are getting older

07:24.520 --> 07:30.280
They are welcome to make a run at it for sure, but they should definitely check in and see what's going on on YouTube

07:30.840 --> 07:35.440
Before they make any grand. Yeah. Yes that jackasses back in the mix because things are

07:36.720 --> 07:42.440
Yeah a lot out there. Yeah, there's a guy on tick tock who's like in this tick tock over the next year

07:42.440 --> 07:46.120
I'm gonna eat my entire house and it's like Johnny and the gang

07:46.560 --> 07:53.400
How are you supposed to beat that? He's gonna eat a whole house in a year. I treated this guy's over here eating houses

07:53.400 --> 07:57.800
He's giving it away for free. I think jackass should come back and just do unboxing videos

07:57.800 --> 08:02.080
But every time they open the box inside, it's just steve-o's genitals

08:02.880 --> 08:06.960
And play every time and it's still attached. Don't get me wrong still attached. Yeah

08:08.840 --> 08:14.440
Yeah, but he's been under the table for the whole time I love funny. All right, this guy's still got it

08:14.440 --> 08:18.480
So this is an advice show. So we'll only have to do this one more time. But when I get mine, I'm gonna be

08:19.000 --> 08:21.980
Like a very coquettish about it

08:21.980 --> 08:26.820
You're not even good. You're not even behind a fan. You're not even gonna know

08:28.220 --> 08:30.940
This is an advice show. I need a second

08:30.940 --> 08:37.180
I'd started heating up a pot of water to make macaroni for Teresa when the kids got home and they haven't left yet

08:37.180 --> 08:42.020
So now there's just a hot pot of water on the stove. I gotta go stop that heat one second. All right

08:43.580 --> 08:45.580
I mean

08:45.580 --> 08:51.140
Keep recording. That's a great. Yeah, that's a great thing to let people know that Travis did

08:51.660 --> 08:56.220
Hey, as long as we're doing chores, I'm do can I get permission from you on something juice?

08:56.380 --> 08:56.860
Yeah

08:56.860 --> 09:03.020
Here's a bad smell coming up through the drain on the floor of my laundry room and smells like an elephant died in my house

09:03.020 --> 09:04.380
Somewhere and I can't find it

09:04.380 --> 09:10.120
So I got the door to my office open out to the outside and getting a little sound of the city

09:10.120 --> 09:14.820
Do you think that's okay? Do you get that in the mix? Yeah, it's fine to get the sound of the city in the mix

09:14.820 --> 09:21.300
Welcome back Trav. We never stopped the show. Oh great. Great. Great. That's good content. I love that's good content

09:21.300 --> 09:23.300
Yeah, that's some content

09:25.220 --> 09:29.540
Okay, so you're back Griffin that's fine get a little sound of the city, okay

09:30.500 --> 09:35.740
And I'm sorry about the smell that's tough as when your house just get to smell

09:35.740 --> 09:44.080
It's a bad one. My dishwasher got a bad smell. Oh man, and then I was like, well you clean you clean for a living

09:44.640 --> 09:51.120
It cleans you and it's like, you know to be like the dishwasher washed the dish who washed the dishwasher

09:51.160 --> 09:53.160
That's great turned out it me

09:55.000 --> 09:57.360
And if you wait too long to clean those things

09:57.960 --> 10:01.680
Some bad things happen. Yeah won't forget can't forget. She can't forget

10:02.520 --> 10:04.520
So this is my show

10:04.520 --> 10:11.280
Um Travis you have places a question from Cora in here. Well, I think that this is important

10:11.280 --> 10:15.320
You know what? I mean? Like I we don't normally treat these as like regular

10:16.000 --> 10:18.480
Listener questions usually that's only because they're not

10:19.040 --> 10:25.360
Well, but this was sent from Nathan and I saw and I instantly thought like this is important. This is this is

10:26.360 --> 10:34.440
perhaps an important cultural touchstone that we could answer and fix and make the world a little bit better and it's rare that we

10:34.440 --> 10:36.440
Have that opportunity

10:36.480 --> 10:38.960
It just seems like a we're gonna cuss a lot

10:39.720 --> 10:42.200
Doing it is it here's a question

10:42.920 --> 10:45.960
Is it for fuck's sake or?

10:47.200 --> 10:49.200
for fuck's sake

10:50.160 --> 10:53.160
It's for a work email so it has to sound professional

10:55.320 --> 11:01.400
It's neither of the ways that they have written it here because they've written it F U C K S no

11:01.400 --> 11:06.600
Apostrophe it is obsessed. It's possessive. The sake is possessive of

11:07.200 --> 11:14.080
Fuck of the f-word. Yeah, and then we move on because it's just it just feels like we're gonna get like really fucking like

11:14.580 --> 11:17.240
Nasty, here's what I think needs to happen Griffin

11:17.240 --> 11:22.040
I think each of us needs to say fuck ten times in a row until the world cuz no the word

11:22.560 --> 11:29.640
Loses meaning right and then we can just discuss it. No, cuz it's done. We're not we're not a whole

11:29.640 --> 11:35.000
George Carlin and we've also said that word so many times and it's fine to say it in the heat of the moment

11:35.360 --> 11:38.480
Fun, but to do it to do it like this

11:39.760 --> 11:41.760
It sucks. It sucks

11:42.320 --> 11:48.200
My my three-year-old daughter threw a chapstick in my eye and it landed right in the eye

11:48.640 --> 11:50.180
Was the chapstick open?

11:50.180 --> 11:55.220
Did you get any chance to open because I was trying to take it from her because she jishes it up the whole way

11:55.220 --> 11:55.680
Oh, yeah

11:55.680 --> 12:01.520
So it's just two inches of chapstick sticking out and it drives me crazy like a dog. Yeah, she's like, okay

12:01.520 --> 12:09.320
Sure, no problem Chuck and then throws it at my head and goes right my eye and I said fuck and then Charlie said

12:09.320 --> 12:13.800
Don't say bad words. I said this is the exact opportunity to say fuck cuz a kid

12:14.920 --> 12:22.160
Not now then when yeah, if not this then why that's weird coming from Charlie who I believe just per capita

12:22.380 --> 12:24.480
Has cursed more in her life than I have

12:24.480 --> 12:28.560
Mm-hmm. So I don't understand where she gets off judging you Justin

12:28.560 --> 12:31.960
I think you're doing fine, but the question that I'm left with Justin is

12:32.520 --> 12:36.600
Was there chapstick on your eyeball? Yeah, was it lip smackers?

12:37.400 --> 12:39.400
Mentholated what are we dealing with?

12:39.520 --> 12:43.960
It was a coconut. It was like a coconut cream pie or something like that

12:45.000 --> 12:48.040
Hey, all right your I feel moisturized afterwards

12:48.040 --> 12:52.960
Uh, no, it was unpleasant. I mean there were tears in it. So yes, I guess it was

12:55.480 --> 12:56.920
Okay, here's a different one

12:56.920 --> 12:57.480
Hello brothers

12:57.480 --> 13:00.440
My partner and I are currently in the middle of making a lovely

13:00.760 --> 13:05.720
Chicken casserole for dinner and we hit a snag the recipe calls for cornflakes for that crunchy touch

13:05.920 --> 13:09.800
But we're plumb out at the moment. However, we do have for rusted flakes

13:10.160 --> 13:14.520
Do I go for that sweet with this chicken bacon rice casserole?

13:14.520 --> 13:19.120
Or do you know any way I can get the frosted off my flakes without them getting soggy?

13:19.480 --> 13:25.760
That's some casserole in without cornflakes. This is your moment Justin. Yes, Justin shine shine, baby

13:25.760 --> 13:30.560
Okay, here is my suggestion to you and I think this is powerful

13:31.080 --> 13:36.000
It's a powerful cooking concept because you guys know I love to mess around in the kitchen. Oh, yeah

13:36.520 --> 13:42.280
Crime scene kitchen. I'll watch it. No problem. I'll watch anything with Joel McHale and kitchen

13:42.280 --> 13:48.240
A mystery. So here's what I'm gonna say. There's a little bit of sugar in everything. Okay?

13:48.680 --> 13:52.140
Okay, is that fair to say she put cornflakes on?

13:52.960 --> 13:56.920
Your casserole you have introduced some sugar from the malt

13:58.120 --> 14:02.400
Flavoring in the cornflake and in the you know in the process of making cornflakes, of course

14:03.600 --> 14:08.680
wh Kellogg introduced sugar that his brother was unwilling to

14:08.680 --> 14:11.800
Introduce because he was a health nut. So

14:12.480 --> 14:15.080
You got sugar in there. Is this fair? Mm-hmm. Yeah

14:15.920 --> 14:20.840
But if you have frosted flakes, oh, you've added more sugar. Okay, that's not bad

14:21.360 --> 14:24.540
All you got to do is you got to grab the other sliders

14:27.440 --> 14:34.920
Jack them up to meet sugar. There's not a there's not too much sugar. There's not enough cumin. Yeah

14:34.920 --> 14:40.120
Yeah, it's not enough paprika you put it all in there you jack up all the flavors

14:41.320 --> 14:48.300
Balanced and it's intense. It's like that. It's like that book and TV show this like salt sugar yummy sweet

14:48.480 --> 14:52.760
Yeah, and then you got the four flavors you have the four flavors of salt

14:53.320 --> 14:57.280
Salt is salty sugar is has that sugary taste to it

14:57.280 --> 15:05.160
Yummy is most of the other stuff and then sweet is like everything that's sweet, but isn't sugar like honey

15:06.360 --> 15:09.000
That that will be my suggestion is yes

15:09.000 --> 15:15.360
You can introduce the frosted flakes, but some flavors have got to come meet the sugar to play with it

15:15.360 --> 15:20.200
Yeah, or else the sugar will be standing out on stage with his pants down around his fucking ankles

15:20.200 --> 15:26.000
Yeah, you know you got to have the other flavors meet it meet it midway. That is my suggestion

15:26.000 --> 15:29.480
What do you are? What would you all really do in this don't do any jokes?

15:34.040 --> 15:37.240
Put joke out of room and just tell me what would you do?

15:37.480 --> 15:44.660
What would you do the truth is Justin when I find myself in this place where it's like recipe calls for some kind of

15:45.480 --> 15:46.920
crunchy

15:46.920 --> 15:53.000
Breaded thing. This is where I start doing that pantry deep dive because there's almost always

15:53.000 --> 15:54.960
some

15:54.960 --> 16:00.960
Cheez-its in there right you gotta have some crunchums. Yeah, I got a four-year-old and a two-year-old

16:01.600 --> 16:03.600
Basically, there's some

16:03.920 --> 16:11.280
Cheez-its somewhere somewhere and cheez-its make an excellent addition the other day. It was making some meatballs

16:11.920 --> 16:16.600
Yeah, and I didn't have breadcrumbs crunched up cheez-its. This is the secret ingredient

16:16.600 --> 16:20.880
I it just like mama used to make boom. Yeah, I

16:20.880 --> 16:22.880
I would say

16:23.000 --> 16:29.520
That a good thing that you could the one thing that you could do. Uh-huh

16:30.080 --> 16:31.800
is

16:31.800 --> 16:33.000
is

16:33.000 --> 16:36.160
She chili cheese Cheetos

16:36.840 --> 16:40.640
Chilly cheese. Sorry, chili cheese Cheetos cheesy cheesy chili

16:41.360 --> 16:46.200
Fritos those. Yeah, those things are fucking great, man. I

16:46.200 --> 16:53.120
Had he knows I had a talkies. No, not one not those just chili cheese Fritos

16:53.120 --> 16:57.680
I had a bowl of chili the other night for dinner and we didn't have any regular Fritos to put in it

16:57.680 --> 17:02.920
So I put chili cheese Fritos in it and it and they canceled out and they disappeared

17:02.920 --> 17:07.200
My bowl was empty when I'm out. It was crazy. Yeah, I didn't know that it worked like that

17:07.200 --> 17:14.240
You know what? Why stop at the Frosted Flakes start replay? Let's see. You got chicken bacon rice, right?

17:14.240 --> 17:18.440
You're gonna add in rice krispies in place of the rice, you know what you can keep the bacon

17:18.440 --> 17:25.560
But I'm gonna want you to make it like maple like candied bacon. Yeah, and for the chicken egg egg is like chicken

17:26.080 --> 17:31.040
Yeah, but beginning of it. Yeah, make a meringue right like do that, right?

17:31.040 --> 17:31.960
This is what we're talking

17:31.960 --> 17:37.520
We're gonna make us a sweet because here's the thing you have cinnamon rolls for breakfast and everybody accepts that right?

17:37.520 --> 17:42.040
But if I want a sugary sweet dinner, everybody like turns their nose up at it, right?

17:42.040 --> 17:45.600
Yeah, I want a sugary sweet casserole for dinner

17:46.440 --> 17:54.480
Throw up everyone. It's 2021 big dog run. I'm making a sweet casserole get in or get out of the way

17:55.000 --> 17:56.680
Yeah

17:56.680 --> 17:59.600
So don't get out of the way. I'm gonna hit you with my car

18:00.080 --> 18:01.600
Yeah

18:01.600 --> 18:03.840
And I'm gonna back up and do it again

18:03.840 --> 18:12.520
Because you got in my way on my way to a sugary sweet casserole dinner and I'll fucking kill you

18:13.080 --> 18:18.520
You with this car you try to say he can't have sweet dinner. Okay. I'll kill you with all right

18:19.040 --> 18:22.160
Yes, we get it and I'll bankrupt your family

18:22.880 --> 18:26.960
Just just because you said don't put don't eat a caramel apple with that chicken

18:26.960 --> 18:31.840
Popeye and I'll try your family stationery store that's been in your family for 200 years

18:31.840 --> 18:38.360
I'll think I'll murder you and I'll fuck you and then I'll buy it and I'll turn it into a store

18:38.360 --> 18:41.200
The only so sweet casseroles. Yeah

18:42.520 --> 18:47.640
Get him. Oh, they're in the car. Oh, they got on board. Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't shit is embarrassing

18:47.640 --> 18:52.040
Hey, do you wanna do you want some wisdom of the crowd? Yeah, please

18:52.040 --> 18:57.720
I saw I saw a bunch of people on Twitter suggest wisdom of the cloud, which I like quite a bit. Oh

18:58.520 --> 18:59.920
I

18:59.920 --> 19:03.080
Maybe maybe that's a good name for it. But you know, I'm in no hurry to

19:03.880 --> 19:06.240
You know solidify this segment

19:07.240 --> 19:10.280
Maybe we should just call it wiki how or wiki. Why not?

19:10.840 --> 19:12.840
Because you wiki how?

19:13.000 --> 19:18.200
Yow wiki out because this is another one of those Dylan sent this in sticky

19:19.080 --> 19:21.080
sticky wiki

19:21.400 --> 19:26.760
Sticky. Oh, I thought you were saying stick you were describing Dylan as sticky Dylan

19:26.760 --> 19:32.720
Sticky but listen, this is sticky Dylan and the article is how to be cat-like and

19:34.200 --> 19:37.240
Whether you need to learn to act like a cat for an acting role

19:37.960 --> 19:41.840
Which is a very limited a very narrow window

19:41.840 --> 19:47.720
I would say I believe there's literally one show that that applies to or if you're gonna be like cat woman

19:47.720 --> 19:50.120
But even she doesn't I don't think like cleaner

19:50.840 --> 19:54.160
Butthole or anything like that, but or you just admire feline behavior

19:54.160 --> 19:58.080
There's several ways you can imitate cats each cat's different, but many of them share different behaviors

19:58.080 --> 20:02.440
Unlike dogs cats can be equally finicky and standoffish as they are affectionate and cuddly

20:03.240 --> 20:09.080
Alright, how are you dogs? Have like dogs have deep inner lives. I won't stand for this

20:09.480 --> 20:14.600
Okay, so doing method one doing cat activities sleep a lot and take cat naps

20:15.040 --> 20:19.760
Yep, do yoga to stretch do yoga to stretch your muscles out so far you are describing

20:19.760 --> 20:27.520
People stuff. Yeah, nice try though clean yours clean yourself often at least okay at least once a day

20:27.920 --> 20:29.920
Yep

20:31.840 --> 20:35.560
Spend time playing outside like a cat or also

20:36.480 --> 20:40.720
Like a person my cat doesn't go outside. Yep

20:40.960 --> 20:47.820
That's also another thing communicating like a cat use body language to communicate your feelings instead of simply your words like people do it

20:47.820 --> 20:54.700
Experiment with the tone of your voice now. We're talking now. We're getting into it. Yeah, I could definitely hiss more

20:54.700 --> 21:01.060
I've been thinking about this lately like the amount of hissing I do is not nearly as high as it could be

21:01.220 --> 21:01.740
Yeah

21:01.740 --> 21:05.660
If you want to be able to talk there's a sub point if you want to be able to talk with cats

21:05.820 --> 21:12.000
Mimic their meows and sounds the best you can listen to how they talk and mimic them, huh? Are we talking now?

21:12.740 --> 21:14.740
Are we talking now?

21:14.740 --> 21:17.620
This took a strong turn. I would say

21:18.700 --> 21:23.740
Talking an upbeat tone when you're happy and content and incorporate a growl into your voice when you're mad

21:24.380 --> 21:27.660
I've never tried that before. I'm gonna try that before me try. I

21:28.460 --> 21:30.860
loved this jet ski I

21:32.940 --> 21:38.340
Hate this jet ski. Yeah, I think I've talked like that. I think I've have you guys heard me talk like that before

21:38.340 --> 21:41.580
Well, I've never I've never heard you hate a jet ski before

21:41.580 --> 21:43.580
You're

21:44.620 --> 21:52.340
Hey, this one's appropriate I have a signature scent so juice you didn't even know that you're gone that kitty cat life in a major way

21:52.980 --> 21:54.980
Yeah with my signature scent

21:55.620 --> 21:57.620
It sent directly

21:58.020 --> 22:04.460
But I mean come in between signature sense right now, but this is the time to talk. No. No, I imagine we'll need that

22:04.460 --> 22:10.140
I'm all friend to interesting interesting response

22:13.500 --> 22:18.160
Lot of people said I I don't want it to ever happen again loved it loved

22:19.220 --> 22:21.300
Loved it. Never again. Hey Justin

22:21.300 --> 22:26.900
Welcome so much to a very exclusive club that I like to call what it's like making jokes when you're Travis

22:27.100 --> 22:33.460
Hello, come on in. Come on in one person. Yeah. No. Oh, it's too late. Look at that. You're already in here

22:33.460 --> 22:38.220
Oh my god, it was built around me. You've constructed it around my prison. I'd trade that for

22:39.140 --> 22:40.460
fucking

22:40.460 --> 22:43.300
Seven years later eat a banana again, idiot

22:44.580 --> 22:49.660
So, um, I went back and treated myself to the video of you eating the banana and Griffin

22:49.660 --> 22:53.820
I do I do want to point out one thing. Yes that the crunch is extremely loud

22:53.820 --> 22:54.060
Yeah

22:54.060 --> 22:59.640
It's pretty loud in the chance that you want to repel someone make a point to cook with garlic and onions or handle other foul smelling

22:59.640 --> 23:05.120
Materials and don't wash them off. That's cool. Well on the other hand cats are not cooking with garlic and onions

23:05.260 --> 23:08.820
No, but they do I guess put a bad stink on them to scare bad cats away

23:08.820 --> 23:14.500
But regardless guess what else you're gonna do you're gonna scare good cats away with your bad smell. Yeah

23:15.020 --> 23:20.020
Hey, this one's wild now. We're getting into it. Now. We're getting into actionable cat

23:20.860 --> 23:22.860
activities cats

23:22.860 --> 23:29.740
Blink slowly to show you like someone reels. It says here real fucking slow make

23:30.380 --> 23:36.500
Your make your eyelids make a noise when they goosh against the bottom. Eyelid make it

23:36.940 --> 23:41.500
Make a make those eyelids clap baby, and then they will know. Oh wow

23:41.500 --> 23:45.820
Is something wrong with your eyes or do you like me a whole lot new?

23:45.820 --> 23:53.060
TikTok challenge film yourself doing this with your significant other and see how they react to it because I think they're gonna really love it

23:53.060 --> 23:55.580
Yeah, they're gonna definitely give the you're into them

23:56.060 --> 23:59.580
Yeah, well it does say here some people may not recognize this behavior

23:59.580 --> 24:05.540
And it may look more like glaring considering consider batting your eyes slowly instead to be less intimidating

24:06.140 --> 24:07.820
That's not anything

24:07.820 --> 24:09.820
Swat someone who's irritating you

24:09.820 --> 24:17.180
Swat someone who is irritating you to warn them okay hit him. Yeah, this one just says hit him a warning

24:17.180 --> 24:22.620
Swat doesn't have to be hard Travis just and sharp enough to get someone's attention, but hey, what was that?

24:22.620 --> 24:26.780
I punched you not very hard though. Yep. That's your words

24:27.260 --> 24:32.220
If a cat if a real fight does break out cats will bite and scratch their opponents just be cautious and consider the

24:32.220 --> 24:36.540
Consequences of using these methods in a real fight with someone hey this escalated pretty fucking quickly

24:36.540 --> 24:43.340
I would say wikiHow and I would say I would say someone who follows this and then accidentally

24:44.220 --> 24:47.580
You know beats the shit out of somebody and goes to court and the judge is like

24:48.140 --> 24:50.540
What are you doing? Why are you blinking so slow at me?

24:50.620 --> 24:53.980
You'd be like no wikiHow told me that this is how I was supposed to work people off

24:53.980 --> 24:58.900
You know how I have a bad smell that was supposed to do the job, but fucking Derek kept coming around

24:59.420 --> 25:04.300
So it's hard because you're so deep at that point. You're already kitty cat at that point

25:04.300 --> 25:08.220
Yeah, you're gonna have to read a wikiHow about how to act like a human. Yep

25:08.780 --> 25:12.740
Okay, so here's behaving like a cat around other people stay alert and aware of your surroundings

25:12.740 --> 25:17.000
Yeah, yeah reacting erratically and jumping at things that startle you is another way. You can imitate cats

25:17.260 --> 25:22.900
That's sure be shy around people. You don't know but warm and welcoming once you've met. Yeah

25:23.980 --> 25:30.260
Just sort of standard operating procedure or ignore people then request attention when you want it so

25:30.260 --> 25:37.300
Now it's just being shitty human. Now it's just being shitty about cats. Yeah, basically anywhere in this article

25:37.300 --> 25:39.380
Does it say bury your poop in some sand?

25:40.260 --> 25:42.260
No, it says bring people presents

25:42.740 --> 25:44.180
well

25:44.180 --> 25:48.260
You can consider uh cats also hunt and leave their kill to provide food to their owners

25:48.340 --> 25:52.740
You can take care of the people you like by feeding them such as cooking them full meals or sharing part of your lunch

25:52.740 --> 25:59.800
Okay, now I am pot committed at this point. I am going to kill a bird and give it to my wife

26:00.360 --> 26:04.700
Because that's what I need to do in addition to gently head butting and nuzzling the people I like

26:04.880 --> 26:09.520
Hmm. I think at this point once you're gently head butting and nuzzling people you like while blinking at them slowly

26:09.520 --> 26:13.620
You've passed the point of denying the fact that yeah, I am pretending to be a cat

26:14.200 --> 26:16.200
Last one is be mischievous. Oh

26:16.200 --> 26:22.120
Oh too late, yeah, that's good make little messes by knocking things off counters

26:22.360 --> 26:28.280
Sit on people when they're trying to work on something or be nosy. He's gotten so straight like you have just

26:29.680 --> 26:32.640
Absolutely overshot your goals. I feel like this. Yeah

26:32.640 --> 26:35.200
This is the last thing wiki how leaves you with this be obnoxious

26:35.200 --> 26:41.520
If someone asks you to stop don't respect their space and don't dial back the cat mimicking don't talk no matter what?

26:41.520 --> 26:47.160
Because if you dial back the cat mimicking, what are you doing? Yeah, you know what I mean? Like what are you even doing?

26:47.160 --> 26:53.040
You're never gonna get cast at that point. You know what I mean? You never because you are this is for the role. Don't forget

26:54.040 --> 27:00.320
You got to be scramble shanks. You need to be scramble shanks. You were born for this. You're born for this role

27:00.320 --> 27:03.920
Here's some questions. I have a cat collar that I made myself and sometimes I wear it

27:03.920 --> 27:08.680
Is that too cat-like? Not at all. You could even go to the extreme and get a real cat collar

27:08.680 --> 27:15.280
Just make sure you can get it off now. Hold on though, because I would argue it is not very cat-like in that

27:16.000 --> 27:22.160
Cats are not out there making collars for themselves. Yeah, if we're going by like the letter of terminology

27:22.920 --> 27:26.120
I think that is very human pretending to be cat-like

27:26.680 --> 27:29.160
But I sure I have owned several cats in my life

27:29.160 --> 27:35.800
Not a single one of them was like begging me for a collar if anything quite the opposite and this is this is maybe the toughest

27:35.800 --> 27:40.280
One how do I know when to stop acting like a cat and begin acting like a human people keep calling me weird

27:40.280 --> 27:45.840
My cousin says that taking naps is for toddlers. Well, that's not true. Hey, that's wrong. Yeah, that's incorrect

27:45.840 --> 27:49.080
I'm 37. Let me tell you taking naps is for winters my man

27:49.080 --> 27:55.800
If I get to take a nap it is to me the sweetest it's it that is truly good for me like happy hour

27:55.800 --> 28:00.200
You know, let's not let's not our let's not focus on that. Let's focus on

28:00.200 --> 28:06.280
Yes, you've been undercover for so long. Yeah. Yeah that you will cross a threshold where

28:07.320 --> 28:13.080
It's no it's more normal for you to be a kitty cat than a human and at that point like you can't

28:13.480 --> 28:18.520
There's an event horizon that once you cross it. You're a cat now

28:18.760 --> 28:22.840
Do you know what I mean? And not a not a person and you would need to find a wiki

28:22.840 --> 28:26.680
How article that would need to reverse the spell and that I don't think they have that one

28:26.680 --> 28:31.480
I'll tell you here's the number one problem. I have with the suzuki how article nowhere in here

28:31.480 --> 28:36.600
Like it should be probably near the beginning is like sit your family and friends down

28:37.080 --> 28:39.080
Tell them you've made a big choice

28:39.640 --> 28:45.720
And you're going to start acting like a cat right because otherwise it seems like throughout here

28:45.800 --> 28:47.800
There's just kind of a growing

28:48.280 --> 28:50.280
underlying concern

28:50.280 --> 28:56.440
From people around you as it's like has he been cursed by a wizard? You need it. You need a clean break, right?

28:56.440 --> 28:58.840
Where it's like tomorrow. I'm cat, right?

28:59.640 --> 29:03.080
Right, so that way tomorrow. I'm cat tomorrow on

29:03.560 --> 29:08.520
I'm cat so that way everyone's on the same page and they're not worried that you're cursed

29:09.000 --> 29:13.320
Right because if I saw I'm thinking we're in a shaggy dog situation, right?

29:13.320 --> 29:18.120
I'm seeing griffin act more and more like a cat. I think oh, he's ignored his family

29:18.120 --> 29:22.600
And he's learning a lesson somewhere out there. There's a cat with griffin in it

29:22.600 --> 29:29.160
And here is a cat in griffin and right learning a lot like a lesson about I don't know how to not sit on

29:29.160 --> 29:35.160
People's laptops or whatever, right and I need to rescue griffin and bring him back to his family

29:35.720 --> 29:37.720
And maybe stop a wizard

29:37.880 --> 29:43.240
You know, so you all remember that kid in your class that whenever the teacher was giving you an assignment

29:43.240 --> 29:46.040
They would like raise their hand and ask a question that they knew the answer to

29:46.040 --> 29:54.360
Just to like get on their radar like oh and miss trambles. Is this do you want mla citation on this?

29:54.360 --> 29:59.880
Oh, yes, derrick, of course. Thank you. Yes, please use mla citation. Thank you, derrick

30:00.440 --> 30:08.120
That's what the energy that this uh, this person asks. I own a cat. Do you think observing him will help me fuck off?

30:08.760 --> 30:13.560
Come on, fuck off. Well, who's gonna be like no, no, it's not looking at a cat

30:13.560 --> 30:19.960
No, no, it's not looking at a cat and studying how it moves and then trying to act like that will not help you

30:20.040 --> 30:23.160
Act like a cat after seeing how it moves. Come on grow up

30:24.120 --> 30:26.120
You're not bringing anything to this

30:26.200 --> 30:28.200
Would you guys like being cats?

30:28.280 --> 30:29.880
um

30:29.880 --> 30:44.040
Depends like a lot of work. I actually think I actually I don't I actually don't care. Let's get the money sound

30:45.080 --> 30:51.000
Stamp it that's what I like to do whenever I have a package that I need to send I stamp it

30:52.520 --> 30:54.520
Now I know what things can you lick

30:55.560 --> 30:57.000
That is fine

30:57.000 --> 31:01.480
The number one stamps, okay, but you don't want to have to go to the stamp store

31:01.800 --> 31:07.160
To get to get these beautiful licking opportunities. No, you could do it right from the comfort of your own home

31:07.560 --> 31:12.200
I don't even know if you lick these bad boys. You don't from stamps.com. What print? No

31:13.080 --> 31:15.080
It prints but you gotta adhere

Yeah stitch fix comes with clothes that you can lick if you want to I wouldn't recommend it

32:58.140 --> 33:03.980
But there's nothing stopping you because what are you gonna do ray bradberry and you guys seem to laugh at that last time

33:04.060 --> 33:07.340
Oh, i'm going to lick all the clothes griffin. Thank you so much for asking

33:07.340 --> 33:13.340
I don't know why he does that that dude's fucking weird ray bradberry get out of here. Oh, he passed

33:13.740 --> 33:16.140
He did pass away almost 10 years. I know i'm a ghost

dirty ghost

33:18.620 --> 33:20.620

33:20.620 --> 33:26.060
You have a personal stylist who is going to say like hey you like this shirt you like these pants?

Because you went through you picked out some stuff that you like you said this is my style

33:30.300 --> 33:35.500
This is my size and this is my budget and then that personal stylist send those pieces to you at home

33:35.500 --> 33:38.460
You try them on if you like them you keep them

33:38.860 --> 33:41.820

33:41.980 --> 33:48.300
You don't pay for it and citrix has free shipping easy returns and exchanges and a prepaid return envelope is included

Okay, I forgot about this

35:21.500 --> 35:23.500
I want a much

35:25.660 --> 35:27.660
I want too much

35:31.340 --> 35:37.660
Welcome to much fun podcast within a podcast profiling the latest and greatest in brand eating

35:37.660 --> 35:42.540
Uh, a couple of people sent this one in. Um, uh, so thank you do

35:43.100 --> 35:45.100
I know stephen and emily

35:45.100 --> 35:49.260
Um for sending sending that along. I very much appreciate it. Um

35:50.540 --> 35:56.620
Yeah, so heinz in canada if you're in canada and you're in heinz there's this new promotion called the heinz

35:57.480 --> 36:00.320
Bottleneck, um, this is only a canadian promotion

36:00.860 --> 36:01.740
Okay, okay

36:01.740 --> 36:09.340
I am shuddering with heinz when heinz gets in the scene heinz gets so fucking nasty. They make their presence

36:09.420 --> 36:10.140
Yeah

36:10.140 --> 36:17.100
Sometimes they skin and shear it so I can't wait to see what they've done now being stuck and exhausting and never-ending traffic

36:17.340 --> 36:19.100
Heinz is a

36:19.100 --> 36:24.060
Really amazing brand by the way. I've been watching foods that build america. Do you ever see this one?

36:24.620 --> 36:28.780
got campbell scott narrating it as these very intense stories of like

36:28.780 --> 36:34.700
Like the dominoes brothers versus the pizza hut brothers with like and it's got reenactments

36:34.860 --> 36:37.180
Oh, I love like if you enjoy munch squad

36:37.260 --> 36:40.780
I just want to give you the hardest possible plug for this show which is like

36:41.420 --> 36:44.860
We have to make the crust thicker the people in new england hate it. It's like

36:45.660 --> 36:47.660
Uh, it's amazing amazing stuff

36:48.300 --> 36:53.340
Uh anyway, but this is about heinz through a partnership with ways and burger king

36:54.540 --> 36:57.100
Heinz will be identifying those stuck in traffic

36:57.100 --> 37:04.700
Driving at the same speed as it's slow pouring ketchup, which is zero point zero four five

37:05.260 --> 37:11.580
kilometers per hour and satisfying their taste buds with heinz ketchup and impossible whopper from burger king

37:11.660 --> 37:14.780
Let's say that say that one that last one again

37:15.100 --> 37:19.580
They're going to be satisfying their taste buds with heinz ketchup and an impossible whopper from burger king

37:19.580 --> 37:26.860
80% of canadians say they will travel in 2021 and I would love to chill with that remaining 20 real quick

37:27.660 --> 37:32.860
No, no, no, I have my year mapped out and I will be a saying but

37:33.740 --> 37:37.100
Uh, but most won't across international borders

37:37.740 --> 37:42.540
Summer traffic is expected to be worse than usual this year, which is why heinz is turning traffic

37:43.100 --> 37:44.140
into

37:44.140 --> 37:46.140
a good thing

37:46.620 --> 37:47.740
So wait

37:47.740 --> 37:51.100
The idea is if you're in traffic and you're moving slowly

37:52.540 --> 37:54.540
Heinz has a way to identify that

37:55.500 --> 37:58.140
from june 3rd to july 4th

37:58.620 --> 38:03.340
Those stuck in traffic who are driving as slow as heinz ketchup

38:03.980 --> 38:07.980
Will be served traffic activated ads in the ways app

38:08.060 --> 38:15.820
What and select slow moving canadians will be provided with this tasty summer combo of heinz ketchup?

38:15.820 --> 38:23.180
Okay, what the fuck and an impossible whopper for burger king how this is going to this is going to

38:23.880 --> 38:29.580
Destroy the canadian infrastructure as we know it because if people know this

38:30.380 --> 38:32.380
people are going to start

38:33.160 --> 38:36.540
collaborating like you're driving slow and then it's like

38:37.420 --> 38:40.780
You'll be driving slow, but not slow enough as ketchup

38:40.780 --> 38:45.020
Up and you'll you know what I mean? And then it's like guys slow it down just a little bit

38:45.260 --> 38:47.260
We almost got the ketchup guys

38:48.460 --> 38:50.460
It the they have a mock-up

38:51.660 --> 38:53.660
Of what this would look like

38:53.660 --> 38:57.500
And it's just a car with you know, and the ways app is there

38:58.220 --> 39:03.260
And it just says at the top we are giving you free ketchup for driving as slow as ketchup

39:04.060 --> 39:05.980
Which I guess is how it'll

39:05.980 --> 39:08.540
Really go surprisingly. This is a quote

39:08.540 --> 39:14.560
So surprisingly many people don't know that heinz pours out of our glass bottle at

39:15.760 --> 39:19.120
0.045 kilometers per hour. That's a surprise to this

39:19.600 --> 39:21.040
You don't know that

39:21.040 --> 39:23.040
A lot of people don't know that

39:23.120 --> 39:24.400
Oh

39:24.400 --> 39:26.800
With more canadians potentially on the road this summer

39:27.200 --> 39:33.600
Whether within their own cities or for weekend getaways traffic is going to be a pain point that we all need to get used to again

39:33.600 --> 39:38.720
We want to help our fans see that going slow isn't always a bad thing

39:39.360 --> 39:45.680
And reward them with the delicious iconically slow pouring heinz ketchup for those terrible traffic jams

39:46.640 --> 39:52.240
Huh says daniel gotlib associate director of brand building and innovation at craft heinz canada

39:53.040 --> 39:57.120
These are the same maniacs by the way that made pumpkin spice craft dinner

39:57.120 --> 40:01.280
So I think this whole company needs to reevaluate what's going on up there up north

40:01.280 --> 40:03.280
Uh, okay. So there are two

40:03.680 --> 40:08.080
Very strong feelings. I need to finish the quote. Okay, please we are thrilled

40:08.800 --> 40:10.800
Thrilled to team up with ways

40:11.360 --> 40:18.320
And also burger king to bring canadians and the meal synonymous with summer and after sitting in weekend traffic

40:18.720 --> 40:23.680
We know there's nothing more satisfying than a delicious burger with heinz ketchup

40:24.320 --> 40:26.320
Now, why is it an impossible?

40:26.960 --> 40:29.680
Whopper question. I don't know that

40:29.680 --> 40:33.200
That's so here are the two overwhelming feelings i'm having one

40:33.600 --> 40:38.480
Okay is very much like you know people talk about has technology gone too far

40:39.120 --> 40:41.040
and the idea that

40:41.040 --> 40:46.960
My phone can communicate the information not just of like where I am or what's happening

40:46.960 --> 40:50.640
I'm used to that but also that i'm going as slow as ketchup

40:51.040 --> 40:56.480
And someone like hey travis is going as slow as ketchup send him that ad that feels like too much but more than that

40:56.480 --> 40:58.880
Mm-hmm. It sounds like

40:59.520 --> 41:01.440
Kraft Heinz canada

41:01.440 --> 41:08.400
Has put a lot of work and capital into this and i'm not a hundred percent sure that they've thought about

41:08.720 --> 41:10.720
the return on investment

41:10.880 --> 41:12.400
of this

41:12.400 --> 41:16.480
This is what I actually think is I think this is my theory on it, right?

41:17.280 --> 41:22.320
I think that hides was like guys. We have a really fucking good idea

41:22.320 --> 41:26.800
Yeah, but if we tell you you have to promise not to cut us out of it

41:27.600 --> 41:30.320
Because we are not essential to it at all

41:30.960 --> 41:35.520
But please it's such a good idea, but you got to promise not to steal it and kick us out of it

41:35.600 --> 41:38.000
Just do it together. Okay, because it's really good

41:39.280 --> 41:44.960
Yeah, I guess the speed of ketchup thing is kind of the hook on the hole. Yeah, but so they

41:46.000 --> 41:48.480
They needed the iconography of ketchup they needed

41:48.480 --> 41:52.720
I wish someone had just been you win with ketchup

41:53.120 --> 41:57.600
Because that's what they've said that every time it's like you win ketchup and I guess a burger if you want that

41:57.600 --> 41:59.280
But you win ketchup

41:59.280 --> 42:05.120
Just go to the drive-thru at canadian burger and they'll give you ketchup, which is already free at burger king

42:05.120 --> 42:11.840
I don't pay just open your pocket and goosh it to the top baby. You don't pay extra for the ketchup packets

42:11.840 --> 42:18.480
It's not there's no deal being made here. Well, that's how that's why it's so hard for the heinz company right now

42:18.560 --> 42:24.000
Think about it. Travis. They've set up an expectation that their shit's always free and you don't it has no value

42:24.240 --> 42:24.800
They should do it

42:24.800 --> 42:28.240
The other this should be a punishment if you get clocked going as slow as ketchup

42:28.400 --> 42:34.880
From now on you have to pay when you go to burger king and you want ketchup now, it's incentive to not have traffic jams

42:35.520 --> 42:37.840
can we just like I just like

42:38.560 --> 42:40.560
heinz canada

42:40.560 --> 42:42.060
is

42:42.060 --> 42:45.120
Absolutely unhinged. Yeah, I just want to go we're just gonna go

42:45.440 --> 42:48.640
You know what? I got a couple more that I just found for the past. Is that okay?

42:48.720 --> 42:56.400
Well, you guys take me on a journey after searching through decades worth of old posts on forgotten blogs and scouring old tweets and forums

42:56.800 --> 43:00.480
Heinz is releasing three news. This is from march 15th

43:01.280 --> 43:05.840
Releasing three new sauce creations inspired by canadians heinz tart shop

43:06.640 --> 43:07.680
Wow

43:07.680 --> 43:09.040
wasabioli

43:09.040 --> 43:10.720
and hansch

43:10.720 --> 43:12.720
hansch

43:13.280 --> 43:15.280
Say all that shit

43:16.720 --> 43:22.020
I'm gonna say it one more time heinz. Tart. Chip tart. Chip was wasabioli

43:23.360 --> 43:25.700
And hansch hansch hansch

43:28.160 --> 43:30.160
Hanch bothers me

43:30.800 --> 43:35.120
Hanz hanz. This is my new boyfriend hanz. This is hanz

43:35.120 --> 43:38.340
Hanz this is my other boyfriend wasabioli

43:39.280 --> 43:45.200
I can't eat. There's too much hansch on hansch is your new daddy. I'll put it in slack. You guys want to see I got

43:45.920 --> 43:47.920
hansch

43:51.040 --> 43:56.480
We're over here having a good time with hansch while like my boy clowning over here tart

43:56.480 --> 44:01.760
Chip is also pretty deep in the set tart. Chip is a mixture. Okay

44:01.760 --> 44:05.360
Hey tart. Chip is a mix of tartar sauce and heinz ketchup

44:05.920 --> 44:11.940
Was shared in a decade old late night tweet by condiment mastermind arianne from toronto

44:12.800 --> 44:20.720
Emma from toronto turned an online wedding forum to remove wasabi and garlic aioli stain on her mother's vintage dress

44:21.420 --> 44:28.560
Unknowingly releasing the recipe for wasabioli right four years ago while looking to subreddit to spice up his pizza order

44:28.960 --> 44:30.960
deep from vancouver

44:30.960 --> 44:36.740
Suspectingly shared hansch, okay, which is a combination of hot sauce and ranch. Okay, but here's the thing

44:37.140 --> 44:38.740
Okay, I

44:38.740 --> 44:42.900
Love a portmanteau, but if you look at tartar. Yeah, look at tartar right?

44:43.060 --> 44:47.700
It's the tar of tartar sauce and the chop of ketchup you look at wasabioli

44:47.780 --> 44:52.260
Oh, yeah, that that's a lot of wasabi in there and some oli in there. There's a lot

44:52.340 --> 44:55.460
There's only like one letter cut off of each hansch

44:55.460 --> 45:02.420
They took the h off of hot sauce maconte and the rest is all ranch

45:02.900 --> 45:07.780
Yeah, it's not it's not fair ranch is most of the sauce i'd bet too in hand

45:07.780 --> 45:12.900
Yeah, and you wouldn't you would look at that. I'm like i'm gonna guess ranch and hands

45:15.140 --> 45:21.060
It's ham ranch, I could be anything I don't know it could be hoisin ranch

45:21.060 --> 45:23.300
It's

45:23.300 --> 45:27.060
I hate it. You you can shit all over them and they're big ideas

45:27.140 --> 45:30.020
But I would love to hear how you would mash these two bad boys up

45:31.860 --> 45:34.420
Hot hot hot hot

45:36.500 --> 45:38.980
Here's the ad I got ad for this when this happened

45:40.100 --> 45:42.740
millions of people post online every day

45:44.100 --> 45:46.180
And some of them post about sauce

45:46.180 --> 45:50.820
But little do they know heinz ketchup is watching

45:52.020 --> 45:55.620
We dug deep across the entire internet to find your old posts

45:56.660 --> 45:58.900
And we turned them into condiments

45:59.920 --> 46:04.500
Introducing three new sauces sourced from the most random corners of the internet

46:05.220 --> 46:07.220
heinz crowd-sourced

46:07.540 --> 46:12.900
Hatch from the 12th post in an archived sub thread of people arguing about pizza

46:12.900 --> 46:18.820
Quasabioli discovered on the advice page of a wedding fashion forum

46:19.780 --> 46:23.940
And tartar posted on social media over 10 years ago

46:24.740 --> 46:29.380
Then we shared the sauces with the actual people who unintentionally created them

46:30.180 --> 46:32.180
Now you can try them too

46:32.660 --> 46:36.020
Careful what you post big ketchup is watching

46:36.820 --> 46:40.600
Like what is what are you trying to establish about your brand?

46:40.600 --> 46:42.200
Yeah

46:42.200 --> 46:46.600
They're clocking your shit 24 7 because yet just a couple months later

46:46.680 --> 46:52.920
You revealed to me that they're watching the speed at which i'm driving and offering me free plant hamburgers in exchange

46:53.880 --> 46:55.080
Yeah

46:55.080 --> 46:57.080
I love this company

46:57.080 --> 47:00.680
They're good. They're they this is one of those rare cases. We're like, yeah

47:00.760 --> 47:05.400
Go ahead and invade this shit out of my privacy you have I will give you access

47:05.400 --> 47:10.920
I trust I will give you access to my my children's birth certificates if you keep cranking out the hits like this

47:11.560 --> 47:12.920
hansch

47:12.920 --> 47:19.480
They need to change their name from heinz to hansch today. And if they this is the new company what is called hansch

47:21.560 --> 47:22.600
Their their uh

47:22.600 --> 47:29.480
Their last one that they did was they asked people to draw ketchup and then they turned what they drew into custom ketchup bottles

47:29.480 --> 47:36.840
I'm telling you can't heinz canada's is is all over it. They've got things. Okay, I think i'd go with

47:37.560 --> 47:39.080
hot saunch

47:39.080 --> 47:41.080
Oh hot

47:41.960 --> 47:43.960
Yes, that would explain your lack of

47:44.100 --> 47:48.120
Contributions i've been working really hard to think about it. Let me give you a twist on that travis

47:48.120 --> 47:50.520
I'm gonna just twist it a little bit hansch. Okay

47:51.080 --> 47:53.480
Did they pay the people that they stole these ideas from?

47:54.040 --> 47:55.480
Definitely not

47:55.480 --> 48:01.160
100 now they pay they get they made their dreams a reality that's a payment right this payment greater than money if you think about

48:01.160 --> 48:03.240
It I wish nerf would come out and be like

48:03.880 --> 48:08.520
As we all know nerf bullets leave the guns at 95 miles an hour

48:09.000 --> 48:13.480
So get out there and if we see that you're driving 95 miles an hour, baby

48:13.560 --> 48:17.640
We're gonna send you some nerf and then just see how how long it takes

48:17.640 --> 48:25.480
Um, how about another question, how would that be would you guys like that? Yeah, please

48:26.200 --> 48:27.400
Sounds good

48:27.400 --> 48:29.960
I was recently invited to my friend's surprise birthday party

48:29.960 --> 48:33.480
Okay, the only caveat is that the party files falls on my birthday

48:33.800 --> 48:39.800
I also found his actual birthday is a few days before the surprise party is I really want to celebrate my friend's birthday

48:39.800 --> 48:41.800
But I also don't want to miss my own birthday

48:41.960 --> 48:45.480
I'm afraid to say anything to them for fear of taking the celebration away from my friend

48:45.480 --> 48:48.360
And should I just lay low and ignore my own birthday?

48:49.000 --> 48:52.920
Almost no one at this thing would know it was my birthday too. So it may be possible

48:53.400 --> 48:58.280
That's from befuddled birthday boy in chicago and that that seems like a surface level question

48:58.360 --> 49:04.920
But as I kept trying to form sentences to curtly respond to it, I actually wasn't coming up with a lot

49:05.480 --> 49:09.640
It's actually kind of challenging. I I tell you the one thing hearing you say it out loud

49:09.800 --> 49:13.240
One of the things that jumped out at me was uh the word almost

49:13.240 --> 49:18.600
Because what that implies is this is not a perfect secret because if you went to this party there is a chance

49:19.240 --> 49:21.240
That someone would say hey

49:21.800 --> 49:23.800
Isn't it your birthday, too?

49:23.960 --> 49:25.320
Oh

49:25.320 --> 49:26.840
Yeah

49:26.840 --> 49:31.960
Oh, man, okay, you're gonna need a collaborator. That's what i'm saying. This is why i'm saying it

49:31.960 --> 49:35.240
This is why it's so tough because someone could very well be like wait

49:36.520 --> 49:42.200
Is it your birthday and that's going to be an absolute mood? Yeah now that's because oh now you made it about you

49:42.200 --> 49:45.880
You need a co-conspirator though who is going to be in this room

49:46.440 --> 49:52.680
Who can look out the window and when they see you coming not the birthday party, you know person who's having the party

49:52.920 --> 49:54.840
They say oh, oh here they come here

49:54.840 --> 49:59.080
They come and then everybody hides and turns the lights off and then the door opens and it's you

49:59.640 --> 50:01.640
And everyone hops out and says surprise

50:01.800 --> 50:08.760
Oh, it's just michael or whatever your name is and then you'll be like, yeah, it's it is my birthday

50:08.760 --> 50:16.840
Okay, and now and now it's their fucking problem because now they're gonna have to take your birthday party away from you

50:17.320 --> 50:19.240
They just gave it to you

50:19.240 --> 50:24.200
They've just christened it your birthday party and now they are going to have to explain to you

50:24.920 --> 50:31.880
I'm, so sorry. We're actually celebrating another person's birthday who it's not really their birthdays three days before and not yours

50:31.880 --> 50:38.760
Fuck you get out of here. Yeah. Sorry. I yeah, I the thing is is i'm assuming you're an adult

50:39.320 --> 50:42.520
Um, and that this isn't like at least 18 or older

50:43.240 --> 50:47.560
And I would say that point birthday has much more become like an excuse to do something

50:48.440 --> 50:55.080
Incorrect, not that age at 25 25. Okay, if you are 25 or older and you're asking this question

50:55.320 --> 50:57.320
I think you just dropped the knowledge because

50:57.320 --> 51:02.200
The fact of matter is and i'm sorry to be the one to reveal this it will not change

51:02.840 --> 51:06.760
The event at all, right except that people will say happy birthday to you

51:06.760 --> 51:10.360
And that's really all you want at that point. Probably no one's going to bring gifts

51:10.760 --> 51:12.760
Yeah, but if you say it beforehand

51:13.240 --> 51:16.520
People are going to wonder why you're saying it like why are you saying?

51:16.520 --> 51:19.320
Oh, well that to go back to griffin saying you do need a plant

51:19.640 --> 51:25.720
You need to tell somebody who's going to tell the organizers like did you know that's also michael if that is your name?

51:25.720 --> 51:30.680
It's also michael's birthday, right? I'm sorry to get that stuck in everyone. So yeah, you've done it not michael

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
But now that's folded in

51:33.240 --> 51:37.080
You can't do it. Oh, let's be clear. You can't be like you can't oh derek

51:37.240 --> 51:43.400
If the other person's name is derek is having a birthday party. Oh, it's my birthday, too. Yeah. No, that's oh

51:44.760 --> 51:49.960
I can't do that, but you could have steven if the other person's name is steven say

51:49.960 --> 51:56.440
Hey, oh derek's having assuming it's derek is having a party. Well, it's michael assuming it's michael's birthday, too

51:56.600 --> 51:58.760
Right. Let's just make it one big thing

51:59.320 --> 52:02.920
Right now that's all fine. That's all fine and dandy

52:03.080 --> 52:07.160
But if susan just assuming you have a friend named susan finds out that you told

52:07.640 --> 52:13.080
Dare or you told steven wait, don't let's just not let's just drop the names. Okay if a

52:13.080 --> 52:19.240
A finds out that b told c to tell d that it was their birthday because of e

52:20.120 --> 52:21.560
then

52:21.560 --> 52:22.840
uh

52:22.840 --> 52:24.280
I'm lost. Um this

52:24.280 --> 52:30.040
No matter what the situation's going to end with nobody ever throwing a birthday present for any birthday party for anybody else in this group

52:30.120 --> 52:35.400
Ever again, so just be careful because birthday parties are great. Uh, I love all the cake and games

52:36.040 --> 52:37.560
Cakes and games are great

52:37.560 --> 52:43.240
Yeah, but what you don't want to do is get there and then someone finds out your birthday and they hastily like scroll your name

52:43.720 --> 52:46.600
Onto the cake. Yeah, I try to fill it. Yeah, they put a post it

52:47.160 --> 52:51.960
Under the sign. Happy birthday to derek and michael, huh?

52:52.760 --> 52:55.880
Well, that was either moment too if you're gonna reveal it on your own

52:56.680 --> 52:58.440
and me

52:58.440 --> 53:03.260
And also me why didn't you remember as you're holding up your driver's license?

53:03.260 --> 53:08.460
For real though and also even more because it's today

53:09.260 --> 53:13.900
Three days ago and I put it on facebook that today was my birthday and none of you fuckers

53:15.580 --> 53:17.580
Am anymore

53:18.780 --> 53:20.540

53:21.500 --> 53:24.220

53:24.700 --> 53:29.340
The status of his zone did not get a response until this morning from travis said doing good

53:29.340 --> 53:35.820
I think and dad just responded now two hours later good good period good period you think you pissed it

Rebuild this bridge because it's tearing our family apart. Should I send him a picture or no?

53:47.740 --> 53:49.740

53:49.740 --> 53:54.540
