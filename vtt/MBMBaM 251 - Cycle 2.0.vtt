00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.120
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool...

00:46.080 --> 00:51.520
Hello everybody, and welcome to cycle 2.0 of my brother, my brother, and me.

00:52.320 --> 00:55.360
I'm Justin McElroy, an oldest brother.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.040
I'm Travis McElroy, and I'm your middle-est brother.

00:59.600 --> 01:02.240
I'm Chaz McElroy, your baby.

01:02.240 --> 01:06.560
We had to rebrand Griffin. We're trying to pull in a different demographic.

01:06.560 --> 01:14.000
It's cycle 2.0. 250 episodes was season one, and now this is cycle 2.0 of my brother,

01:14.000 --> 01:18.400
my brother, and me. A new chapter begins today.

01:18.400 --> 01:21.680
Justin, it's actually now it's Powerade Presents My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

01:21.680 --> 01:25.680
Sorry, you're right. I forgot. Powerade Presents My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

01:25.680 --> 01:31.280
cycle 2.0, and boys are in the house, but that's been the situation for a while.

01:31.280 --> 01:33.280
Travis, what are some of the big changes, you think,

01:33.280 --> 01:36.080
coming in cycle 2.0 of my brother, my brother, and me?

01:36.080 --> 01:38.000
Well, we added a talking dog.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.400
We should point out, I am the talking dog, Chaz.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.520
A talking dog named Chaz McElroy.

01:41.520 --> 01:44.480
We had to really rebrand Griffin a lot.

01:44.480 --> 01:48.880
Listen, we sat the focus group down for 250 hours.

01:49.760 --> 01:53.440
They were in our house for six weeks. It was miserable.

01:53.440 --> 01:58.560
They ate all of my Doritos, and they said, the only feedback they gave us was,

01:58.560 --> 02:04.160
A, you need a long-lasting, refreshing corporate sponsorship,

02:04.160 --> 02:08.560
and Travis immediately was like, Powerade, and he called up his people at Powerade,

02:08.560 --> 02:11.280
and then they were like, of course we're on board.

02:11.280 --> 02:15.280
One thing we're going to need, though, is it too late to introduce a talking dog?

02:15.280 --> 02:17.760
And also, we're not crazy about the youngest one,

02:17.760 --> 02:19.600
and then we said, two birds, one stone.

02:19.600 --> 02:23.040
I got elective dog surgery on my whole body.

02:23.040 --> 02:28.800
They basically cut my whole body off and replaced it with where there were human parts.

02:28.800 --> 02:31.040
They took each human part, replaced it with the dog part,

02:31.040 --> 02:33.520
and then I was like, okay, I'm Griffin the dog,

02:33.520 --> 02:36.240
and then the focus group was like, oh, we've made a terrible mistake.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.720
Is it too late to reverse the surgery?

02:38.720 --> 02:41.920
Also, are we married to the name Griffin?

02:41.920 --> 02:46.880
And I said, I guess not, but yes, on the reversing the surgery thing.

02:46.880 --> 02:47.280
I'm a dog for life.

02:47.280 --> 02:48.960
They'd already thrown away his body.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.760
You can do a full body replacement once,

02:51.760 --> 02:54.320
but any more than that, and you're just playing God.

02:54.320 --> 02:58.400
Anyway, long story short, I can't stop eating my own asshole.

03:00.960 --> 03:01.920
I have promises.

03:01.920 --> 03:05.920
I want to make promises to the audience in cycle 2.0 of My Brother, My Brother, Me.

03:05.920 --> 03:09.520
One, the stunts are going to get wetter.

03:09.520 --> 03:12.400
Two, the challenges are going to get bigger and wilder.

03:12.400 --> 03:17.360
Three, four new judges that will be revealed as the season progresses.

03:17.360 --> 03:19.440
Oh, man, these are going to be some juicy stunts.

03:19.440 --> 03:22.160
These aren't going to be the wettest stunts yet.

03:22.160 --> 03:26.000
Like really wild, wild challenges, wet stunts.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.080
Look at this way.

03:28.080 --> 03:31.120
Listening to it from home, stunts are going to be so wet,

03:31.120 --> 03:32.240
you're going to have moist ears.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.120
You're going to have the moistest ears.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.480
We talked to the focus group and they were like,

03:36.480 --> 03:38.560
you got to drop the quiz section from the show.

03:38.560 --> 03:40.080
You got to drop the quiz segment.

03:40.080 --> 03:42.240
It's where all of your viewers tune out.

03:42.240 --> 03:43.600
And so we're dropping those.

03:43.600 --> 03:48.560
It's all stunts now, all challenge games and all trust activities.

03:50.320 --> 03:53.680
We're going to do a lot of team building exercises in cycle 2.0.

03:53.680 --> 03:55.120
Going to take me to a low ropes course.

03:55.120 --> 03:58.480
I am going to have trouble with it because of my new short, short dog legs.

03:59.040 --> 04:02.240
We actually are doing this episode, Griffin's blindfolded

04:02.240 --> 04:05.680
and Justin's giving him directions to get around the jokes.

04:05.680 --> 04:08.560
So that's, it's just the kind of thing we're bringing.

04:08.560 --> 04:11.040
But really, really, really though, really though?

04:11.040 --> 04:12.640
Isn't that how it's always been?

04:12.640 --> 04:13.600
Basically, yeah.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.440
Listen, let's get to the advice.

04:15.440 --> 04:20.000
That's one of the things in cycle 2.0 is enough of this kind of thing.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.320
But it's going to be just so you're prepared, advice, stunt,

04:24.320 --> 04:28.800
then two advices, then two stunts and so on until we've gone for an hour.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.080
Physical challenge.

04:30.080 --> 04:33.840
Right, well, that's only if Travis lies.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.760
If Travis ever lies, we have to do a physical challenge.

04:36.960 --> 04:40.000
It's going to be very confusing for 250 episodes,

04:40.000 --> 04:42.960
but then by 501, we're going to be on some new shit.

04:42.960 --> 04:44.480
Maybe I'll get my man body back.

04:44.480 --> 04:48.400
I also just, I real quick wanted to say happy birthday to my wife, Teresa.

04:48.400 --> 04:52.320
And I will miss her very much since the producers cut her from the show.

04:52.320 --> 04:54.240
Yeah, she's out now.

04:54.240 --> 04:55.520
But I loved her.

04:55.520 --> 04:58.640
I loved her with the time we had and happy birthday.

04:58.640 --> 05:00.320
Maybe you'll get maybe you'll get remarried.

05:00.320 --> 05:02.160
This is maybe that'll be part of the reboot.

05:02.160 --> 05:03.040
That will be a twist.

05:03.760 --> 05:06.960
No, she's already started dating George Lopez on his show.

05:06.960 --> 05:08.640
Well, she's dating him on the pilot.

05:08.640 --> 05:09.040
We'll see.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.320
Yeah, that's true.

05:10.320 --> 05:10.800
You're right.

05:11.600 --> 05:18.160
Listen, normally we forget about these bits much like yourself as soon as we record them.

05:18.160 --> 05:24.160
But today, if the youngest member of our show is referred to as anything other than Chaz,

05:24.160 --> 05:30.480
I will immediately disconnect the call and we'll just have to reschedule another time

05:30.480 --> 05:32.160
where we're more in the zone.

05:32.160 --> 05:36.080
And by this episode, you mean for the next five years?

05:36.080 --> 05:36.720
Well, right.

05:36.720 --> 05:38.880
For the next 250 episodes, whichever comes first.

05:40.080 --> 05:42.320
Okay, Travis, Chaz, are you ready?

05:42.320 --> 05:42.560
Yes.

05:43.920 --> 05:46.560
Ever since I was a kid, I was told how well I clean up.

05:46.560 --> 05:50.720
Whenever I put on something nice like a suit or a dress shirt and style my hair,

05:50.720 --> 05:53.520
I get told by people I clean up really well.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.120
I always found this offensive.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.120
Do I look like a pilot dump before that?

05:57.120 --> 05:59.040
Not sure if I should take it as a compliment or an insult.

05:59.040 --> 06:01.760
That's from moderately offended in Ohio.

06:02.720 --> 06:04.960
Find better things to get upset about.

06:04.960 --> 06:05.840
Next question.

06:05.840 --> 06:07.760
That's a new thing in cycle 2.0.

06:07.760 --> 06:10.400
We're gonna do 800 questions per episode.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.880
Yeah, we're just gonna say that to basically everybody.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.160
There's another side to this situation.

06:16.160 --> 06:18.800
My friend Jeremy Dubin dresses nice every day.

06:18.800 --> 06:23.920
Like dress shirt, tie, like a dapper vest every day.

06:23.920 --> 06:25.120
Yeah, you're bragging now.

06:25.120 --> 06:30.000
Well, so when he wears a t-shirt and jeans, everybody grows concerned and is like,

06:30.000 --> 06:30.560
are you okay?

06:31.600 --> 06:32.480
Are you feeling sick?

06:32.480 --> 06:33.760
Are you not feeling well?

06:33.760 --> 06:36.000
So it goes the other way too, where it's like,

06:36.000 --> 06:40.240
oh, I guess you clean down really poorly.

06:40.240 --> 06:46.880
Travis has just described my Twilight Zone hell where me wearing cargo shorts

06:46.880 --> 06:50.480
and a Tybee Island, it's five o'clock somewhere t-shirt

06:50.480 --> 06:54.800
invites more conversation than I do on a day-to-day life.

06:54.800 --> 06:58.160
I, when I possessed a human man body,

06:59.360 --> 07:06.320
I had a very different problem where I would dress like a pilot dump all the time.

07:07.040 --> 07:10.960
Except when one of my friends decided to get married and put me out

07:10.960 --> 07:16.720
and I would put on a suit and I would look like a large,

07:16.720 --> 07:22.960
very sophisticated ventriloquist dummy because there's no suits that fit my body

07:22.960 --> 07:25.440
that don't make me look like a sick boy.

07:25.440 --> 07:29.040
Now, this is not a problem I have to deal with anymore, fortunately.

07:29.040 --> 07:29.840
Thank goodness.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.120
One of many benefits.

07:31.680 --> 07:32.560
Of dog body.

07:32.560 --> 07:33.680
Of dog body, yeah.

07:34.320 --> 07:38.320
I don't think it's an insult, but it's definitely a commentary.

07:38.320 --> 07:44.080
I think that maybe, what do you normally wear?

07:44.080 --> 07:50.240
Is this a way of saying you normally maybe strive for a higher level like this all the time?

07:50.240 --> 07:54.720
Or do you think it's just people, usually you only see this in movies

07:54.720 --> 07:57.360
when someone shaves off a big, bratty beard.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.280
Right, or takes off their glasses.

07:59.280 --> 08:02.240
And Rachel Lee Cook was always under those glasses.

08:03.040 --> 08:05.360
They were always, she was always under those glasses.

08:05.360 --> 08:08.160
And it's your fault for not having imagination.

08:08.160 --> 08:10.000
And also she looked really great with the glasses.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.360
What the fuck's wrong with you?

08:12.240 --> 08:13.680
Freddie Prinze Jr.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.520
Get it together, FPJ.

08:16.880 --> 08:20.000
I think that, you know, it's just a pleasantry.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.040
They're just acknowledging that you're wearing a clothing that is one, like,

08:26.080 --> 08:28.320
formal notch higher than what you normally wear.

08:28.320 --> 08:30.800
They're just like acknowledging it because otherwise,

08:30.800 --> 08:34.320
think about like if you just wore a tux and in your head you're like,

08:34.320 --> 08:39.040
dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun, like everybody who wears a tux at any point,

08:39.760 --> 08:41.280
singing the James Bond theme song to themselves,

08:42.000 --> 08:45.040
and no one paid, noticed it, that would be terrible.

08:45.040 --> 08:45.760
That would be a bummer.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.040
That would be a real bummer.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.640
I think they're just like, it's just a pleasantry.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.880
Like, hey, I'm noticing you're wearing something.

08:51.840 --> 08:56.560
But it is said in a very diminutive, you clean up real well.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.000
It's like an old-timey pleasantry.

09:00.000 --> 09:00.960
It's just like a-

09:00.960 --> 09:04.240
Back in the old times when everyone was dicks, right?

09:04.240 --> 09:04.560
Yeah.

09:04.560 --> 09:05.840
It's time for us to move on.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.920
You're 110%, that's what I want now.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.840
Normally you're 100%, I would say.

09:11.840 --> 09:15.440
Now you've added an extra 10 on top of that because you're wearing a cummerbund.

09:15.440 --> 09:18.400
Have you guys noticed that people of a generation before us,

09:18.400 --> 09:21.600
and maybe even like two generations before us technically,

09:21.600 --> 09:29.600
like, tend to keep the formality like one to two notches higher constantly?

09:29.600 --> 09:30.240
Like-

09:30.240 --> 09:32.080
Even in speech or in clothes?

09:32.080 --> 09:39.920
Like in clothes, I very regularly see like old dudes doing yard work in khakis.

09:39.920 --> 09:46.400
And they like look like they are like uncomfortable in the khakis like to relax.

09:46.400 --> 09:48.720
Like, boy, I'm really letting it all hang out.

09:48.720 --> 09:51.520
I mean khakis and a tucked in polo shirt.

09:51.520 --> 09:57.040
I've been working on this pejorative slang term for people in generations older than mine.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.560
And I just want to bounce it off you guys.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.800
And then I'm going to take it to the focus group and see what they think about it.

10:00.800 --> 10:08.080
But how do you feel about calling people of our daddy or our grandma's generation shirt tuckers?

10:08.080 --> 10:10.480
Because they're the only people left that are still, you know,

10:10.480 --> 10:12.240
practicing that particular behavior.

10:12.240 --> 10:15.840
I like that, Griffin, because it's got a lot of fun consonant sounds in it.

10:15.840 --> 10:16.640
Right, and it's-

10:16.640 --> 10:18.240
Oh, he's a real shirt tucker.

10:18.240 --> 10:18.960
You know what I mean?

10:18.960 --> 10:19.440
There's no-

10:19.440 --> 10:20.480
There are two reasons.

10:20.480 --> 10:23.680
The only reason you would tuck your shirt in is you're really proud of your belt.

10:23.680 --> 10:25.040
And you want people to see that.

10:25.040 --> 10:25.920
But otherwise you're just-

10:25.920 --> 10:29.440
Or you're on mad TV and you're doing an impression of a shirt tucker.

10:29.440 --> 10:30.560
Like a shirt tucker character.

10:30.560 --> 10:30.960
Exactly.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.000
Right, exactly.

10:32.000 --> 10:37.040
Otherwise, it's just your shirt's touching your pubis at that point.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.000
And I don't want to think of it.

10:38.000 --> 10:38.880
You're making me think-

10:38.880 --> 10:42.240
Every time I see anybody with their shirt tucked in, I just look at them and I go, ugh.

10:42.240 --> 10:43.680
Because I think about what's going on in there.

10:43.680 --> 10:44.480
You're basically-

10:44.480 --> 10:48.160
It's just basically just a grift to convince people your shirt doesn't have a bottom to it.

10:48.160 --> 10:48.560
Yeah.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.240
Like, we know it does.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.720
Like, you're raising the question, does my shirt end?

10:52.720 --> 10:53.520
I don't know.

10:53.520 --> 10:54.400
You'll never know.

10:54.400 --> 10:55.520
Maybe it's a nice shirt.

10:55.520 --> 10:56.640
Maybe it goes all the way to my ankle.

10:56.640 --> 10:57.040
Right, that's another-

10:57.040 --> 10:58.320
I'm not wearing footies.

10:58.320 --> 10:59.600
It's a onesie, right?

10:59.600 --> 11:01.280
It's a button-down onesie.

11:01.280 --> 11:02.880
I'm gonna start asking people.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.800
You know, their shirt's tucked in.

11:04.800 --> 11:07.120
They say, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

11:07.120 --> 11:07.840
Is that a onesie?

11:07.840 --> 11:09.120
Does that go all the way down?

11:09.120 --> 11:10.400
Go all the way down.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.400
Well, can I see your leg cuffs?

11:12.400 --> 11:14.880
Take off your pants to prove that's not a onesie.

11:14.880 --> 11:15.520
Shirt tucker.

11:15.520 --> 11:19.520
Off air, I want to talk to you guys about the possibility of me starting to wear a jumpsuit

11:19.520 --> 11:20.240
as like a look.

11:20.800 --> 11:23.680
I don't see why that's a conversation that can't take place on the show, Travis.

11:23.680 --> 11:24.720
Is that a thing I should do?

11:24.720 --> 11:26.080
Should we take it to the focus group?

11:26.080 --> 11:26.800
Oh, yes.

11:26.800 --> 11:31.760
Like, I think a jumpsuit with embroidered lightning on it.

11:31.760 --> 11:32.640
You know what I mean?

11:32.640 --> 11:35.280
And I mean the word lightning, not a picture of lightning.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.520
Or the word lightning made out of lightning.

11:37.520 --> 11:38.960
Oh, man, we got that.

11:38.960 --> 11:39.520
We got some sanity.

11:39.520 --> 11:42.640
Little presumptuous, though, that you think that you could come up with your own nickname

11:42.640 --> 11:44.880
and the focus group would be down with it because, like, I don't know.

11:44.880 --> 11:45.760
If I had my druthers-

11:45.760 --> 11:46.720
And yeah, I'm not complaining.

11:46.720 --> 11:49.760
I feel like it's gonna be really great for the show, but God, I wish I was a man, boy

11:50.320 --> 11:51.920
person, human person still.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.200
Well, but Griffin, when we signed the Rich and Famous contract-

11:55.200 --> 11:57.040
What did you call me?

11:57.040 --> 11:58.080
I'm sorry, Chaz.

11:59.440 --> 12:00.720
And there goes the call.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.040
Well, the call's been disconnected.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.040
At this point, I've disconnected the call.

12:06.240 --> 12:08.480
So you're probably hearing different things from my brothers.

12:08.480 --> 12:09.360
I'm calling them back now.

12:11.600 --> 12:12.560
And we're back.

12:12.560 --> 12:13.520
And we're back.

12:13.520 --> 12:14.240
Okay, we're back.

12:14.880 --> 12:17.280
Let's not do that again, guys, because I think it's gonna be disorienting.

12:17.280 --> 12:18.800
Whatever the listener just heard.

12:18.800 --> 12:19.920
Yeah, are we back?

12:19.920 --> 12:21.040
Is everybody still recording?

12:21.040 --> 12:22.320
I don't want the episode.

12:22.320 --> 12:22.880
Okay, good.

12:23.440 --> 12:24.160
How about a Yahoo?

12:24.160 --> 12:25.360
Hit me, Chaz.

12:26.720 --> 12:30.640
This Yahoo was sent in by Ira Ray.

12:31.280 --> 12:33.120
Are you Ira Ray?

12:33.120 --> 12:34.000
Who wants to know?

12:34.000 --> 12:34.640
Thank you, Ira Ray.

12:34.640 --> 12:36.320
It's by Yahoo Answers User.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.640
In Cycle 2.0, we sang the whole song.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.200
Oh, God, we don't have the rights for that.

12:42.080 --> 12:49.040
Tulip Blushie asks, I need a good intro for a spelling bee speech.

12:49.040 --> 12:53.920
I am running a spelling bee, and I would like a catchy intro to start off my speech.

12:53.920 --> 12:54.960
Any suggestions?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.960
Y'all ready to start spell?

13:00.960 --> 13:01.680
No, fuck.

13:01.680 --> 13:02.160
It's hard.

13:02.160 --> 13:03.920
I see why they came to us with this.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.920
Because I thought I was just gonna be able to shit one out, but it's tricky.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.360
Get on up and spell.

13:10.240 --> 13:12.880
Well, that's not really the start of the speech.

13:12.880 --> 13:14.160
Spelling you later.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.520
The more I think about it, if it's the speech...

13:15.520 --> 13:16.720
Sorry, what is the speech?

13:16.720 --> 13:18.560
What is the speech?

13:18.560 --> 13:22.720
It's how before a spelling bee, somebody gets up there to get everybody fucking hyped.

13:24.480 --> 13:27.840
Okay, first thing, I think you gotta start off saying the word combatants.

13:28.640 --> 13:30.000
Welcome, combatants.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.880
Combatants, today you find yourselves in the battle dome.

13:34.880 --> 13:35.680
And you would...

13:36.400 --> 13:38.320
Sorry, it would have to take place in a battle dome.

13:38.320 --> 13:42.000
Oh, yeah, you gotta drop a chain link cage over them.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.280
Yeah, that's the part.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.880
Okay, so let me start over.

13:44.880 --> 13:45.920
Okay.

13:45.920 --> 13:46.480
Combatants.

13:47.280 --> 13:47.920
Solid.

13:47.920 --> 13:50.560
Combatants of Lamar Middle School.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.120
Thank you all for coming.

13:53.120 --> 13:56.800
Parents, thank you for supporting your children in this endeavor.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.080
Just try your hardest out there.

14:00.080 --> 14:05.840
And remember, even if you get kicked off, we've got some Capri Sun pouches

14:05.840 --> 14:09.280
waiting for you offstage to refresh yourselves.

14:09.280 --> 14:13.200
Remember, we're only gonna be able to send three students to the state bee.

14:13.200 --> 14:16.240
All that being said, drop the cage!

14:16.240 --> 14:21.600
And then the cage would drop, and maybe one or two students would get caught underneath it.

14:21.600 --> 14:25.200
And that's just like, that's the rules of the game, baby.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.960
Like, you gotta keep your wits about you in the bee.

14:26.960 --> 14:31.760
Okay, but if you're gonna do that move, I think that Lamar Middle School is gonna have to bring in

14:31.760 --> 14:36.960
a ringer, maybe somebody who's won some cage match spelling bees before.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.080
I see, I see.

14:38.080 --> 14:40.880
Maybe he's like four or five years older than these other kids.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.240
Maybe he's 19 years older.

14:42.240 --> 14:43.360
He's 19 years older.

14:43.360 --> 14:48.480
Yeah, and he's ripped, and he's bald, and like, covered in ash.

14:48.480 --> 14:52.000
And he's got tattoos made out of blood all over his body.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.400
They just spell out F-U-C-K-Y-O-U.

14:54.400 --> 14:58.480
Right, and his teeth are made of steel, rusted steel.

14:58.480 --> 15:02.080
He's got a bolt through his forehead.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.520
I think, wait, hold on, okay?

15:05.520 --> 15:06.720
I'm picturing it.

15:06.720 --> 15:11.520
And he's got sharp bone spurs sticking out of his back.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.920
And he's kind of like a wasteland monstrosity.

15:13.920 --> 15:17.360
And he wants everybody to know, I'm in charge of this spelling bee.

15:18.080 --> 15:21.120
I think in order to get a weapon, you should have to spell it.

15:21.120 --> 15:25.920
Like if you spell K-A-T-A-N-A, like a katana drops from the ceiling.

15:26.480 --> 15:27.280
Oh, that's great.

15:28.240 --> 15:28.960
Wouldn't that be good?

15:28.960 --> 15:29.680
Oh, too late.

15:29.680 --> 15:33.600
You've been chewed to death by the wasteland spelling monster.

15:33.600 --> 15:37.440
You've been stabbed to death because unfortunately, psi is super easy to spell.

15:37.440 --> 15:38.560
It's just three letters.

15:38.560 --> 15:39.520
You should have thought of that.

15:39.520 --> 15:44.960
Michael, your word is mercy.

15:44.960 --> 15:45.760
I'm sorry.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.200
I don't know the meaning of the word.

15:47.200 --> 15:48.720
Oh, would you like the definition?

15:48.720 --> 15:49.120
Yes, please.

15:49.120 --> 15:49.920
That would be great.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.040
Use it in a sentence.

15:51.040 --> 15:51.840
Use it in a sentence.

15:51.840 --> 15:52.800
No mercy for you.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.000
I'm the wasteland killer.

15:56.720 --> 16:00.240
I have long kicked around the idea of like,

16:00.960 --> 16:05.040
wouldn't it be fun to do a My Brother, My Brother, Me game jam

16:05.040 --> 16:08.160
where for 48 hours, people make video games.

16:08.160 --> 16:12.000
You know, little games based on ideas, concepts, images,

16:12.640 --> 16:14.320
words from My Brother, My Brother, Me.

16:15.280 --> 16:16.560
I've always thought that would be a good idea.

16:16.560 --> 16:21.200
Now I feel like it has to happen so I can fucking play spelling bee battledome.

16:21.200 --> 16:24.400
Like, this sounds like a really good game.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.600
Sounds like a really good game.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.480
Can I add a twist?

16:27.200 --> 16:29.520
Yeah, yeah, of course.

16:29.520 --> 16:31.520
I love adding twists to things.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.280
That's what Chaz is all about.

16:33.840 --> 16:36.080
Chaz is all about putting lemon wedges in his drinks.

16:36.080 --> 16:42.720
CycleTube has wetter stunts, bigger challenges, wilder twists.

16:43.440 --> 16:44.640
Here's a wild twist.

16:44.640 --> 16:49.920
All of the children have to hold an actual bee.

16:50.640 --> 16:54.000
And if they let it go because it stings them

16:54.000 --> 16:58.480
or crush it to death because it stings them, the kid's getting stung.

16:58.480 --> 17:03.440
But if the bee is released or destroyed, the child is out of the bee.

17:03.440 --> 17:07.440
Oh, and all of the contestants have to have bee allergies.

17:08.240 --> 17:11.520
Well, no, I mean, that would be a significant strength, right?

17:11.520 --> 17:13.440
So Terrence gets up to the mic, right?

17:13.440 --> 17:14.800
And he's like, what's my word?

17:14.800 --> 17:16.320
And the word is Appalachian.

17:16.320 --> 17:20.320
And he's like, cool, let me think about it for like 15 minutes.

17:20.320 --> 17:21.840
And the other kids are being stung.

17:21.840 --> 17:24.080
But fucking Terrence, not allergic.

17:24.080 --> 17:25.520
And his dad-

17:25.520 --> 17:28.720
He's just holding his bee by the wing like some sort of zen master.

17:28.720 --> 17:32.240
His dad, who won the battledome spelling bee in 1995,

17:32.240 --> 17:36.320
knew what was coming and surgically altered the nerves in his hands.

17:36.320 --> 17:38.880
So he can't feel a goddamn thing down there.

17:38.880 --> 17:42.000
He'll never know the touch of another person.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.520
But he's going to win that bee.

17:43.520 --> 17:49.360
Terrence, it seems your right arm is rotting off from poison,

17:49.360 --> 17:50.800
from the toxins of the bee.

17:50.800 --> 17:51.200
Oh, sorry.

17:51.200 --> 17:55.200
They're super nano bees that have all kinds of nano poisons and stuff.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.840
They're like the size of a medium sized dove.

17:57.840 --> 17:58.640
You know what I would do?

17:58.640 --> 18:02.880
I would be like, I would be the real hard ass kid.

18:02.880 --> 18:05.120
I would just swallow it instantly.

18:05.120 --> 18:06.640
Like that bee's not going anywhere.

18:06.640 --> 18:08.640
And they're like, but the bee's probably dead now.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.480
And it's like, you'll have to cut me open to find out.

18:10.480 --> 18:10.880
That sounds-

18:10.880 --> 18:13.120
And then get cut open by the wasteland monster.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.600
Well, no, he's a pacifist.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.040
He's just really good at spelling.

18:17.040 --> 18:18.560
And he's super allergic to bees.

18:18.560 --> 18:19.520
That's his one weakness.

18:19.520 --> 18:21.200
It's an intimidation game.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.840
He's just trying to make the kids mess up at spelling.

18:23.840 --> 18:24.880
It's like a haunted house.

18:24.880 --> 18:30.080
Like listen, the wasteland monster cannot touch you and you cannot touch the wasteland monster.

18:30.080 --> 18:32.000
Because if you do, oh my God.

18:33.360 --> 18:34.000
Wow.

18:34.000 --> 18:34.960
Oh wow, it's bad.

18:34.960 --> 18:37.040
We're not responsible for your safety.

18:37.040 --> 18:39.280
So I think if you just get up and that's the intro.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.240
Word for word, everything we just said.

18:42.240 --> 18:43.680
Spell, spell real good.

18:43.680 --> 18:44.320
Watch the cage.

18:44.880 --> 18:46.320
Don't touch the wasteland monster.

18:46.320 --> 18:46.880
Oh my God.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.640
That last part is the most important part.

18:48.640 --> 18:50.000
I cannot stress this enough.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.160
If the cage falls on you, you might be okay.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.640
If you touch the wasteland monster, that's it.

18:54.640 --> 18:57.520
Just remember, if the cage falls on you, that's merciful.

18:59.520 --> 19:00.480
It's a good way to go.

19:01.040 --> 19:04.400
And if it goes past the two-hour time limit, we electrify the cage.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.440
So yeah, for sure.

19:05.440 --> 19:09.040
We got to, because we have to be out of the gymnasium by three.

19:09.040 --> 19:11.360
Yeah, they're having a PTA meeting.

19:11.360 --> 19:14.000
And we have to put the mats down.

19:15.120 --> 19:16.960
You guys, we got to be out of here by three.

19:16.960 --> 19:20.720
Also, the wasteland monster has a night shift at the 7-Eleven.

19:20.720 --> 19:21.920
He's got to get to.

19:21.920 --> 19:25.680
Also, if you get one of your arms lopped off, go ahead and tap out

19:25.680 --> 19:27.840
because you're not going to be able to enjoy that Capri Sun

19:27.840 --> 19:29.360
if you lose both of your arms.

19:29.360 --> 19:30.000
That's true.

19:30.000 --> 19:30.160
Right.

19:30.160 --> 19:30.880
You need one.

19:30.880 --> 19:34.880
You need one to apply pressure to the pouch and the other to apply the straw.

19:35.760 --> 19:36.320
Exactly.

19:37.040 --> 19:39.520
What do we got planned for our listeners?

19:40.240 --> 19:40.480
What?

19:42.160 --> 19:42.960
Very wet stunt.

19:42.960 --> 19:45.200
Oh, for our first super wet stunt?

19:45.200 --> 19:45.760
Yeah.

19:45.760 --> 19:46.000
Okay.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.360
For our first super wet stunt.

19:47.360 --> 19:48.160
I got a cup of water here.

19:48.160 --> 19:52.240
I can pour it on my dog penis.

19:52.240 --> 19:53.360
Who doesn't love that?

19:55.440 --> 19:58.240
I could get really crazy and sexual with this Powerade bottle.

19:59.760 --> 20:01.600
Well, that's what they're paying for.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.000
Okay.

20:02.000 --> 20:02.240
Right.

20:02.240 --> 20:03.360
Here's the first stunt.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.440
It's a crowd participation stunt.

20:05.440 --> 20:05.680
Okay.

20:06.240 --> 20:12.560
Right now, right this second, grab the nearest cup, fill it with the nearest liquid,

20:12.560 --> 20:16.240
take a picture of yourself drinking it, and tweet it to MBMBAM.

20:16.240 --> 20:17.120
Well, no, because it could be-

20:17.120 --> 20:18.160
And we'll retweet them.

20:18.160 --> 20:20.720
And then it's just like, that's like the first stunt.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.520
It's like a big prank.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.280
And you get bonus points if it's Powerade.

20:24.560 --> 20:24.800
Yeah.

20:25.360 --> 20:28.400
If the Powerade label is prominent, that would be excellent.

20:28.400 --> 20:29.360
Let's just edit it.

20:29.360 --> 20:30.160
Edit this.

20:30.160 --> 20:31.040
Here we go.

20:31.040 --> 20:32.400
Here's your first stunt.

20:32.400 --> 20:33.840
Go buy and drink some Powerade.

20:35.360 --> 20:36.000
They're gonna love that.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.680
Don't drink the first liquid that's close to you,

20:37.680 --> 20:40.000
because if you're doing laundry right now, you're dead.

20:40.000 --> 20:40.800
And that's on us.

20:41.840 --> 20:42.080
Yeah.

20:42.080 --> 20:42.640
I want Powerade-

20:42.640 --> 20:44.320
Just tweet a picture of yourself drinking Powerade.

20:44.320 --> 20:47.600
Use the MBMBAM hashtag so we know.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.520
And the hashtag Powerade hashtag.

20:51.200 --> 20:54.080
Hashtag the Thirst Annihilator.

20:54.720 --> 20:57.600
Hashtag Power Boys, which is special.

20:57.600 --> 20:59.760
It's how they track like our efficacy.

21:01.040 --> 21:03.680
Power Boys with three Z's, and each one of those that happens,

21:03.680 --> 21:04.960
we get like 15 bucks.

21:04.960 --> 21:05.600
So yeah.

21:05.600 --> 21:06.880
I met Jackie Chan.

21:06.880 --> 21:07.920
He's super awesome.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.160
What?

21:10.160 --> 21:13.200
My brother was doing a commercial in Hong Kong when he was like five,

21:13.200 --> 21:15.120
and he was the most stubborn child you can imagine.

21:15.120 --> 21:19.680
However, Jackie Chan won him over every day by bringing him a little toy.

21:19.680 --> 21:20.880
Do not worry.

21:20.880 --> 21:24.160
Jackie Chan is just as cool and kindhearted as you imagine him being.

21:24.160 --> 21:26.320
Tim, not a question, Tim.

21:26.320 --> 21:28.080
But I certainly do appreciate-

21:28.080 --> 21:28.640
Holy shit.

21:28.640 --> 21:29.920
Your email.

21:29.920 --> 21:30.800
Can you every-

21:30.800 --> 21:31.280
Okay.

21:31.280 --> 21:33.120
Jackie Chan won him over every day.

21:33.120 --> 21:34.640
That means multiple days.

21:34.640 --> 21:39.120
Jackie Chan fucking stopped by KB kids toy store.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.920
And was like, gotta get something for Jeremy.

21:41.920 --> 21:44.320
That's what Jackie Chan sounds like.

21:44.320 --> 21:45.040
You nailed it.

21:45.760 --> 21:47.440
What do you think Jeremy would like?

21:47.440 --> 21:48.960
Maybe a super soaker.

21:48.960 --> 21:52.080
And then by the end of the week, seven super soakers,

21:52.080 --> 21:54.880
all signed by Jackie Chan, which makes them more powerful.

21:56.160 --> 22:00.640
Did the kid have blank slate disease that like he forgot the day before

22:00.640 --> 22:02.160
Jackie Chan had won him over?

22:02.160 --> 22:04.720
Or was he just like, well, you got today, Chan.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.320
What are you going to bring today?

22:06.320 --> 22:08.720
Did Jackie Chan have blank slate disease?

22:08.720 --> 22:10.560
I have got to win over this little kid.

22:10.560 --> 22:13.040
Dude, he's a tough nut to crack.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.120
Wait, man, you already got six super soakers.

22:15.680 --> 22:17.200
And now you're signing them all of them?

22:17.200 --> 22:17.840
Wait a minute.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.240
What a goose I am.

22:21.280 --> 22:23.520
Anyway, here's some back flip.

22:26.160 --> 22:28.000
Do you guys remember that time in Philadelphia?

22:28.000 --> 22:28.320
Yeah.

22:29.120 --> 22:29.360
Okay.

22:34.640 --> 22:36.080
I can't- after I said that,

22:36.080 --> 22:38.080
I feel like we probably told that story on the show before.

22:38.080 --> 22:38.720
Probably.

22:38.720 --> 22:39.600
Anyway.

22:39.600 --> 22:43.760
We saw a guy in the streets of Philadelphia who came up to our family and said,

22:43.760 --> 22:46.320
I do something the whole family can enjoy, backflips.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.480
And we were down.

22:48.480 --> 22:49.520
And he was right.

22:49.520 --> 22:50.640
I did enjoy it very much.

22:50.640 --> 22:51.680
It was awesome.

22:51.680 --> 22:55.600
I want you at home, if you're listening to this in your car or your office,

22:55.600 --> 22:58.320
I want you to take a second, think about the relationships in your life.

22:58.320 --> 23:03.760
Jackie Chan every day bought a toy to win over

23:04.800 --> 23:07.440
just some kid that he was shooting a commercial with.

23:07.440 --> 23:09.040
Are you bringing that level?

23:09.040 --> 23:14.160
Are you bringing Jackie Chan levels of consideration and intensity to the relationships

23:14.160 --> 23:16.960
that really matter to you in your day-to-day life?

23:16.960 --> 23:21.440
Don't let yourself be outpaced by Jackie Chan.

23:21.440 --> 23:24.480
Well, but you don't have a choice because he's very, very fast.

23:24.480 --> 23:27.600
He's laps ahead of you at this point, but you can try to catch up.

23:27.600 --> 23:32.560
WW- well, WWJCD.

23:32.560 --> 23:34.400
That's not particular- that is not different.

23:35.040 --> 23:35.360
Whoa.

23:36.000 --> 23:36.480
Whoa.

23:36.480 --> 23:37.120
Hold on.

23:37.120 --> 23:37.600
Hold the-

23:37.600 --> 23:40.160
Hold the phone.

23:40.160 --> 23:42.400
I mean, I don't- I think it was just WWJD.

23:42.400 --> 23:44.000
I don't think they were that formal with it.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.200
But still, I mean, either way, no matter which way you slice it.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.520
Jackie Chan is Jesus.

23:49.520 --> 23:51.280
Well, I'm not saying that.

23:51.280 --> 23:52.000
Oh.

23:52.000 --> 23:52.400
I'm just saying-

23:52.400 --> 23:53.040
I am.

23:53.040 --> 23:53.920
I- you know what?

23:53.920 --> 23:54.640
I am.

23:54.640 --> 23:57.920
I'm ready to finally go out on a limb and just be honest here and say-

23:57.920 --> 24:01.120
So are you saying- are you- so would you extend this to everybody?

24:01.120 --> 24:02.000
Is that like saying,

24:02.000 --> 24:05.840
Oh, this is- this is my friend, American roots rocker at Jesus Christ melon camp.

24:05.840 --> 24:06.640
Is that what you're saying?

24:06.640 --> 24:10.640
Which is- this is my friend, JC Chazee, who is also Jackie Chan.

24:12.880 --> 24:16.720
A good friend and classmate just started a new campus job as brand ambassador.

24:17.280 --> 24:19.120
Sorry, that was a hard word to say.

24:19.120 --> 24:20.080
Brand ambassador.

24:20.080 --> 24:21.760
Brand brand ambassador.

24:21.760 --> 24:26.480
My good friend and classmate just started a new campus job as a brand ambassador for a local

24:26.480 --> 24:26.880
company.

24:27.680 --> 24:31.840
We all went to the info session, but she's the only one who got super excited about it.

24:31.840 --> 24:36.880
Now all she ever talks about is this company and this job and she blows off school and

24:36.880 --> 24:38.480
friends for it constantly.

24:38.480 --> 24:42.320
How can I delicately tell her that she's driving everybody fucking crazy?

24:42.320 --> 24:47.040
This is from board of brands in Boise and the fact that you did not tell us the brand.

24:47.040 --> 24:47.920
What the fuck?

24:47.920 --> 24:48.800
Or what a brand ambassador is.

24:48.800 --> 24:50.400
DQ'd this emailed.

24:51.520 --> 24:52.320
I- I-

24:52.320 --> 24:52.800
It's DQ.

24:52.800 --> 24:53.520
It's Dairy Queen.

24:55.600 --> 24:56.640
Hot Eats Cool Treats.

24:56.640 --> 24:58.480
That's this person's tease.

24:58.480 --> 25:02.480
I- I mean, if the brand is Powerade, I get it.

25:02.480 --> 25:03.760
They're a wonderful company.

25:04.560 --> 25:06.240
They treat their workers with respect.

25:06.960 --> 25:07.600
I'm told.

25:08.480 --> 25:13.280
I think a brand ambassador- a brand ambassador is like the person that like, you know, is

25:13.280 --> 25:18.000
wearing like an embroidered, you know, like a polo shirt and they come up and they're

25:18.000 --> 25:24.160
like, hey, can I tell you about AT&T or like, hey, would you guys like to try some of this

25:24.160 --> 25:29.520
Jamba Juice or whatever and like, they just kind of walk around and like, bring the marketing

25:29.520 --> 25:30.320
to you, right?

25:30.320 --> 25:36.160
Do they legally have to, like, identify themselves or is it just like you're saying it's somebody

25:36.160 --> 25:38.480
on the train and they're like, Jamba Juice.

25:38.480 --> 25:39.040
Heard of it.

25:39.760 --> 25:40.480
Catch the wave.

25:41.520 --> 25:45.920
Oh, are you saying like maybe it's an underco- or what they do is they do like buzz marketing

25:45.920 --> 25:49.600
where they go into like a bar and they're like, I've heard really good things about

25:49.600 --> 25:50.800
Sierra Nevada, right?

25:50.800 --> 25:51.760
Yeah, if that's the thing-

25:51.760 --> 25:53.360
I've wanted to try that for a while.

25:53.360 --> 25:58.880
If that's the- the- the- what's going on, then I have been a brand ambassador for Gold

25:58.880 --> 26:02.880
Bond dryness powder since I was born.

26:02.880 --> 26:03.760
Well, not since I was born, but-

26:03.760 --> 26:05.680
Alright, listen, this conversation's going great.

26:05.680 --> 26:10.160
Want to hear more about how much you miss your Aunt Terry, but I have got to take a

26:10.160 --> 26:10.960
GV break.

26:11.520 --> 26:12.640
Excuse me, everybody.

26:12.640 --> 26:16.800
And if you try this stuff, it is out of this world.

26:16.800 --> 26:19.600
You just stand up at the table and that's it, you're full on.

26:20.240 --> 26:21.200
Hey, where's your shitter?

26:21.200 --> 26:22.400
I need to go puff.

26:22.400 --> 26:23.680
What are you talking about?

26:26.880 --> 26:30.080
I scoot it over a- I scoot it over a turlet seat and I do a puff so it makes it look like

26:30.080 --> 26:31.040
a genie's coming out.

26:35.600 --> 26:36.800
You want to give her a try?

26:36.800 --> 26:38.400
Take her for a test spin.

26:38.400 --> 26:38.960
Take her for a try.

26:38.960 --> 26:43.040
I've got a special- here, listen, I've got a- listen, I've got a reusable applicator

26:43.040 --> 26:45.120
that I can just pop on there for you.

26:45.120 --> 26:48.160
Just make sure that you wash it off in the sink.

26:48.160 --> 26:51.280
Don't get any water in the powder because it'll compromise it.

26:51.280 --> 26:55.440
My Gold Bond Medicated Powder has two trays that you can open.

26:55.440 --> 27:00.240
One's a big one and it says for me, and then there's a little one that says for them.

27:00.240 --> 27:01.440
It's like for guests.

27:01.440 --> 27:03.360
It's like guest Gold Bond Medicated Powder.

27:03.360 --> 27:07.280
And the bartender just stares at you and he's like, oh my God, a talking dog.

27:09.600 --> 27:10.960
I don't believe it.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.920
This night has gotten pretty rough.

27:13.920 --> 27:15.600
And then you're like, ah, good one.

27:15.600 --> 27:16.080
Got it.

27:16.080 --> 27:20.320
Yeah, I guess maybe an email.

27:23.280 --> 27:25.600
Maybe some kind of well-worded note.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.760
Yeah, this doesn't seem like a mouth conversation to me.

27:29.600 --> 27:32.160
No, because what if she's deep into this brand?

27:32.160 --> 27:32.960
What if it's like-

27:32.960 --> 27:35.600
We have to pick a brand because this conversation is too confusing.

27:35.600 --> 27:36.480
Okay, pick a brand.

27:39.520 --> 27:40.400
Emerald Nuts.

27:40.400 --> 27:40.880
Emerald Nuts?

27:40.880 --> 27:42.320
Emerald Nuts, right?

27:42.320 --> 27:44.240
Oh, that seems likely.

27:44.240 --> 27:45.680
She's nuts about nuts, right?

27:45.680 --> 27:46.960
She's losing it.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.160
I think you got to go to her.

27:48.160 --> 27:52.320
But if you're like, hey, you need to fucking cut it out with all the Emerald Nuts shit.

27:52.320 --> 27:53.040
We're over it.

27:53.040 --> 27:55.360
And she's like, but have you guys tried it yet?

27:55.360 --> 27:59.920
And I think it's just a circuitous, maddening cycle.

27:59.920 --> 28:05.360
But instead, you leave an anonymous note that's like, we've heard enough about the nuts.

28:05.360 --> 28:06.240
Fucking drop it.

28:06.800 --> 28:09.680
Then I think you got some traction.

28:11.200 --> 28:12.720
Maybe a blackmailer.

28:12.720 --> 28:20.560
Or could you start wearing paraphernalia from a competing brand?

28:20.560 --> 28:26.160
So you show up in a Diamond Nuts t-shirt and then she looks at you and she's like,

28:26.160 --> 28:29.520
well, I was about to tell you about Emerald Nuts, but apparently you-

28:29.520 --> 28:31.040
Sorry, I'm affiliated.

28:31.600 --> 28:32.320
Yeah, I'm already...

28:33.200 --> 28:34.480
Yeah, I gave it the office.

28:35.040 --> 28:36.880
I already have my nut brand.

28:37.920 --> 28:38.960
I'm dyed in the wool.

28:38.960 --> 28:39.760
Diamond for life.

28:40.320 --> 28:41.920
Is there really a brand called Diamond Nuts?

28:41.920 --> 28:43.920
And also there's one called Emerald Nuts.

28:43.920 --> 28:46.640
Yeah, wait, yeah.

28:46.640 --> 28:49.600
No, I think you're having a dream right now, but you're awake.

28:51.440 --> 28:55.360
No, Diamond of California.

28:55.360 --> 28:58.240
They're the ones that have the little packages of nuts that you find in the cooking site.

28:58.240 --> 28:59.440
And then Emerald welled up?

28:59.440 --> 29:00.880
What's a good name for a company?

29:00.880 --> 29:02.320
How about Diamond Nuts?

29:02.320 --> 29:03.680
Now they already did that one.

29:03.680 --> 29:04.560
Who got there first?

29:05.920 --> 29:07.440
Planters was the OG, but-

29:07.440 --> 29:09.200
Well, I mean, that's not a stone though.

29:09.200 --> 29:12.000
Well, George Washington Carver probably had his own brand.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.880
When he first popped one of those bad boys in his mouth, he was like, here we go.

29:14.880 --> 29:15.520
He called them Ruby Nuts.

29:16.320 --> 29:17.680
These are my Ruby Nuts.

29:17.680 --> 29:19.920
I can't believe I'm the first person to nosh on these nuts.

29:19.920 --> 29:20.960
These are amazing.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.560
I'm George Washington Carver.

29:22.560 --> 29:24.320
I invented eating a peanut.

29:26.080 --> 29:28.480
Everyone assumed they were poisonous until this point.

29:28.480 --> 29:30.400
And also the stoplight.

29:30.400 --> 29:31.040
Fuck all y'all.

29:32.880 --> 29:34.160
Should we go to the Money Zone?

29:34.160 --> 29:36.720
I mean, this whole fucking show is the Money Zone now, so-

29:36.720 --> 29:40.080
Yeah, it's just a brand heavy cycle 2.0.

29:40.080 --> 29:41.360
Let's take a Powerade break.

29:41.360 --> 29:43.600
Or we don't talk about Powerade for a minute.

29:43.600 --> 29:43.840
Yeah.

29:44.880 --> 29:46.800
That's what we mean by Powerade break.

29:46.800 --> 29:47.600
A power pause.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.120
But just know that we're still thinking about it.

29:51.120 --> 29:52.720
Yeah, we're still gonna be thinking about it.

29:52.720 --> 29:55.760
Oh yeah, we're still gonna be sipping it in the background.

29:55.760 --> 30:08.320
If you need something to-

30:08.320 --> 30:10.000
What's the reverse of wash down?

30:10.000 --> 30:10.480
Dry up?

30:13.280 --> 30:16.400
If you need something to dry up before you wash down Powerade,

30:16.400 --> 30:18.640
make sure you reach for Nature Box Snacks.

30:18.640 --> 30:24.000
This is a snack subscription service with wholesome stuff you can feel good about.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.520
No colors, no sweeteners, no trans fats, no high fructose corn syrup.

30:27.520 --> 30:31.600
Trust me, you're getting plenty of all those from Powerade.

30:32.640 --> 30:35.120
They have some new snacks to tell you about.

30:35.120 --> 30:37.600
I am going to add these to my list right away because they sound amazing.

30:37.600 --> 30:38.800
Mini Belgian waffles.

30:38.800 --> 30:39.040
Goddamn.

30:39.040 --> 30:39.520
What?

30:39.520 --> 30:44.000
Drawberry lemonade fruit stars and sweet and salty nut medley.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.760
Oh my god, the first movement of the sweet and salty nut medley.

30:47.760 --> 30:49.360
Will bring a tear to your eye.

30:49.360 --> 30:49.920
Spring.

30:49.920 --> 30:50.960
I think it's called Spring.

30:50.960 --> 30:51.280
I think it's called Spring.

30:51.280 --> 30:51.840
Interpose.

30:51.840 --> 30:56.400
If you want to try Nature Box and you should, if you haven't,

30:56.400 --> 30:58.720
you should go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

30:58.720 --> 31:02.080
You can get a free trial of some of their favorite snacks.

31:02.080 --> 31:04.160
If you have not done this yet, what do you wait?

31:04.160 --> 31:04.880
It's free.

31:05.680 --> 31:07.280
Just go get the free snacks.

31:07.280 --> 31:10.240
Maybe they were awaiting the arrival of mini Belgian waffles.

31:10.240 --> 31:12.960
I don't know if those are going to be in the trial box.

31:12.960 --> 31:14.720
I can't make any promises.

31:14.720 --> 31:18.000
It is impossible to say, but maybe, I don't know,

31:18.000 --> 31:21.200
maybe they were just waiting for something to make their mouth water.

31:21.200 --> 31:23.760
And the very idea of there being little Belgium waffles

31:23.760 --> 31:27.840
that don't have any fructose in them is just, that's enough.

31:27.840 --> 31:28.640
Look all through them.

31:28.640 --> 31:29.600
Tear them apart.

31:29.600 --> 31:30.640
Look in every inch of them.

31:30.640 --> 31:32.560
You won't find a single bit of fructose in there.

31:32.560 --> 31:34.960
That address again is naturebox.com slash my brother.

31:34.960 --> 31:37.440
Go get some of those free snacks.

31:37.440 --> 31:41.520
Now in Powerade's electric lightning blue fructose stew,

31:41.520 --> 31:44.320
you're going to find a shit gaggle of fructose.

31:44.320 --> 31:45.360
Holy shit.

31:45.360 --> 31:49.040
It's like 98% fructose, 2% blue food coloring.

31:49.040 --> 31:52.160
I also want to tell you about Harry's.com or other sponsor this week.

31:52.880 --> 31:55.680
Harry's is going to offer you a better shave.

31:55.680 --> 31:57.520
You may think you like shaving now.

31:57.520 --> 31:58.720
If you're not a Harry's customer,

31:58.720 --> 32:01.200
you don't have any fucking idea what you're talking about.

32:01.760 --> 32:04.720
Harry's razors give you a high quality shave that's better for your face,

32:04.720 --> 32:06.640
but also your wallet.

32:06.640 --> 32:09.280
You can get a starter set for 15 bucks.

32:09.280 --> 32:12.720
That includes a razor, foaming shave gel or shave cream.

32:12.720 --> 32:14.080
I recommend the shave cream personally.

32:14.080 --> 32:14.720
That's just me.

32:14.720 --> 32:20.560
And three razor blades plus free shipping for $15.

32:20.560 --> 32:20.800
What?

32:21.600 --> 32:22.240
Yeah, I know.

32:22.240 --> 32:23.040
That's so good.

32:23.040 --> 32:25.440
What if I were to tell you I only have $10?

32:25.440 --> 32:27.520
That's all the money I have in this world.

32:27.520 --> 32:28.320
Good news, Chaz.

32:28.320 --> 32:32.480
If you go to Harry's.com, you can get $5 off the starter set

32:32.480 --> 32:34.400
with a code mybrother.

32:34.400 --> 32:35.280
That's all one word.

32:37.840 --> 32:38.480
Sorry, Jeff.

32:38.480 --> 32:41.440
I was going to say it's good for men and women.

32:41.440 --> 32:45.840
My former wife, now George Lopez's girlfriend, loves it.

32:45.840 --> 32:47.760
So like, you should try it out.

32:48.800 --> 32:49.360
I'm done.

32:49.360 --> 32:55.200
I'm tired of fishing my razor blades out of Powerade's laser blast razor slash,

32:55.200 --> 33:00.800
which is a red drink that is like drinking a child's volcano science fair project.

33:01.600 --> 33:03.680
But with razors inside of it.

33:03.680 --> 33:06.640
I'm going to switch to this new service today.

33:06.640 --> 33:10.000
Harry's.com, get $5 off the starter set with code mybrother.

33:10.000 --> 33:10.960
That's all one word.

33:10.960 --> 33:13.200
Start shaving better today.

33:13.920 --> 33:16.400
I also think, just Harry's, if you're listening,

33:16.400 --> 33:18.800
maybe there's something there where you could do like,

33:18.800 --> 33:22.240
start shaving and start saving or something like that.

33:22.240 --> 33:22.880
I don't know.

33:22.880 --> 33:23.840
We'll workshop it.

33:23.840 --> 33:24.960
We'll figure it out for you.

33:24.960 --> 33:25.680
Don't worry.

33:25.680 --> 33:27.360
That's one of the services we offer here.

33:27.360 --> 33:31.120
I have a message blast for Jonathan and Colleen,

33:31.120 --> 33:33.600
the Northwest Embassy Ambassadors.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.880
Official titles.

33:36.880 --> 33:40.880
These people are apparently the presidents of the Northwest.

33:40.880 --> 33:43.600
The message is from Kristen and the Sally's.

33:44.480 --> 33:45.040
Sally's.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.920
This one's really tripping me up.

33:47.920 --> 33:49.840
These dog eyes of mine just can't read.

33:51.840 --> 33:53.920
The message is, here it comes.

33:54.560 --> 33:56.000
Lashley birthday haiku.

33:56.640 --> 33:58.320
Your birthdays have come.

33:58.320 --> 34:00.560
Your 20s almost over.

34:00.560 --> 34:01.760
Glad we can share them.

34:02.960 --> 34:04.240
Is that our first haiku?

34:04.240 --> 34:04.960
Is that our first?

34:04.960 --> 34:08.080
There's no, what is it?

34:08.080 --> 34:09.920
There's no season words in here.

34:10.480 --> 34:12.880
If you're gonna put in, if you're gonna do a haiku,

34:12.880 --> 34:15.120
I would have wanted a spring season word.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.960
A supple, throw that in there maybe.

34:18.160 --> 34:21.040
A brook, put that in there and then it would have been a proper.

34:21.040 --> 34:22.400
But I see you just haven't,

34:22.400 --> 34:25.440
you've chosen not to do this haiku in the Japanese style.

34:25.440 --> 34:26.400
And I get it.

34:27.520 --> 34:28.240
That's fine.

34:28.240 --> 34:28.640
I get it.

34:28.640 --> 34:29.280
It's fine.

34:29.280 --> 34:30.080
You're trying something new.

34:30.080 --> 34:33.200
This is sort of a transcontinental fusion.

34:33.200 --> 34:34.400
And I'm into it.

34:34.400 --> 34:36.960
I'm really into transcontinental fusion right now.

34:36.960 --> 34:39.120
Anyway, happy birthday, Jonathan and Colleen.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.000
Congratulations.

34:40.640 --> 34:41.600
Do we have another one?

34:42.320 --> 34:42.560
No.

34:43.200 --> 34:44.240
But we do.

34:44.240 --> 34:45.120
We do.

34:45.120 --> 34:45.680
Oh man.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.800
It's over here behind the couch, Justin.

34:48.800 --> 34:50.400
I was saving it for you.

34:50.400 --> 34:51.280
Fantastic.

34:51.280 --> 34:54.000
This is a message for Kate from Christian.

34:54.800 --> 34:56.800
Christian says, happy two year anniversary.

34:56.800 --> 34:59.040
Although we can't go on the amazing race,

34:59.040 --> 35:01.120
I'm still excited to travel the world with you

35:01.120 --> 35:03.520
and have even more incredible adventures together.

35:03.520 --> 35:04.960
We make a great team.

35:04.960 --> 35:06.400
Thank you for your support

35:06.400 --> 35:08.000
and all the effort you put into

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
making this long distance thing work.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.120
Also, I will beat you at Dominion someday.

35:13.120 --> 35:14.320
Love, Christian.

35:14.320 --> 35:15.200
How sweet.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.320
This is a sweet message.

35:17.200 --> 35:20.320
Dominion's a hard game to pick up.

35:20.320 --> 35:21.520
Is it a game?

35:21.520 --> 35:22.320
Yeah, it's a board game.

35:22.320 --> 35:23.280
Speaking of games,

35:23.280 --> 35:24.640
should we talk about the amazing race

35:24.640 --> 35:26.320
just real quick for like 15 minutes?

35:27.520 --> 35:28.480
Sure, go ahead.

35:28.480 --> 35:30.160
I've never watched an episode, but go for it.

35:30.160 --> 35:31.360
Here's what's up this season.

35:31.360 --> 35:35.200
They took six teams, all dating couples or married.

35:35.200 --> 35:36.560
All couples, pre-existing.

35:36.560 --> 35:39.360
Other six teams, they done matched them up.

35:39.360 --> 35:41.360
They said, you and you, you're in love now

35:41.360 --> 35:42.480
and you're gonna travel the world

35:42.480 --> 35:46.560
and you're gonna compete in wacky wet stunts and challenges

35:46.560 --> 35:47.680
and it's gonna be amazing

35:47.680 --> 35:49.360
and all of you are gonna fall in love.

35:49.360 --> 35:51.200
And at every pit stop feels like,

35:51.200 --> 35:52.720
so did y'all fall in love yet?

35:52.720 --> 35:55.760
And they're still like, no, stop asking.

35:55.760 --> 35:56.880
How much of a bummer is that?

35:56.880 --> 35:59.040
Or you just had to like stack up a bunch of watermelons

35:59.040 --> 36:00.080
and it took you six hours

36:00.080 --> 36:02.320
and you're really sweaty and really fucking frustrated.

36:02.320 --> 36:04.960
But when you get to the pit stop, you barely eked it out.

36:04.960 --> 36:06.560
Skinning your teeth, made it to the pit stop

36:06.560 --> 36:08.400
and feels like, so did you two kiss?

36:09.200 --> 36:10.240
No, we haven't kissed.

36:10.800 --> 36:11.680
We've been busy.

36:12.240 --> 36:16.000
We had to solve a goddamn word search

36:16.000 --> 36:18.880
in the size of a city for you, you twisted fuck.

36:22.400 --> 36:24.400
Somebody send this to amazing race.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.000
And please let me be on the amazing race.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.520
Holy shit, I'll do anything.

36:27.520 --> 36:28.800
I don't care who you part.

36:28.800 --> 36:30.800
Can we do a three man team on the amazing race?

36:30.800 --> 36:31.440
Is that fair?

36:31.440 --> 36:32.240
Is that allowed?

36:32.240 --> 36:33.520
Is that in the rules?

36:33.520 --> 36:37.200
We would not make it out of the parking lot.

36:37.200 --> 36:38.640
They did one season.

36:38.640 --> 36:39.760
Not the worst.

36:39.760 --> 36:41.760
Did you guys hear they canceled the amazing race

36:41.760 --> 36:43.280
because those three guys got killed?

36:43.280 --> 36:44.560
Here's the weird thing.

36:44.560 --> 36:48.080
They were on their way to set to shoot the first episode.

36:48.080 --> 36:49.280
They're probably the worst.

36:49.840 --> 36:52.000
One tried to grab the wheel from the other one

36:52.000 --> 36:53.920
and then the third one made a fart noise

36:53.920 --> 36:55.040
and they all laughed so hard

36:55.040 --> 36:57.040
because they thought it was so fucking funny.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.320
And then one of them said boners

36:58.320 --> 36:59.760
and that really sent him in stitches.

36:59.760 --> 37:01.760
And then they drove into a ravine.

37:01.760 --> 37:03.840
But they were dead before they even crashed.

37:03.840 --> 37:05.600
That's probably from laughing too hard.

37:06.480 --> 37:09.120
They were all eating like they're all sharing a churro

37:09.120 --> 37:11.120
and there might have been some like cinnamon dust

37:11.120 --> 37:13.280
go down their throats and they choked to death on it.

37:13.280 --> 37:15.200
Here's the other thing about their car

37:15.200 --> 37:18.480
was littered with Powerade containers.

37:18.480 --> 37:19.920
Here's the weirdest thing.

37:19.920 --> 37:22.720
They let the youngest one drive and he's a dog.

37:24.320 --> 37:24.880
That's the thing.

37:24.880 --> 37:26.480
That's our that's our hook.

37:26.480 --> 37:28.800
We pretend Griffin, sorry, what?

37:28.800 --> 37:29.520
No, that's me.

37:34.160 --> 37:35.440
I'm Cameron Esposito.

37:35.440 --> 37:36.480
I'm Rhea Butcher.

37:36.480 --> 37:37.680
I am Ricky Carmona.

37:37.680 --> 37:40.080
And we are the cast members, what?

37:40.080 --> 37:44.240
I don't know, podcastiness of Wham Bam Pow.

37:44.240 --> 37:47.120
That's an action sci-fi movie podcast

37:47.120 --> 37:50.080
you can find on maximumfun.org or on iTunes.

37:50.080 --> 37:51.280
And what do we do?

37:51.280 --> 37:52.880
News reviews and things you can use.

37:52.880 --> 37:54.000
Tons of things you can use.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.440
We break it down so it can forever be broken.

37:57.440 --> 37:58.720
Hilarious jokes.

37:58.720 --> 38:00.320
Plus, sometimes there's a dog in the studio.

38:00.320 --> 38:01.600
Sometimes there's a dog here.

38:01.600 --> 38:04.240
We'll see you in your earbuds.

38:11.920 --> 38:13.040
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

38:13.040 --> 38:14.160
Yeah, of course.

38:14.160 --> 38:14.400
Yes.

38:15.120 --> 38:17.200
This Yahoo was sent in by Tom Harriman.

38:17.200 --> 38:17.920
Thank you, Tom.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.520
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

38:19.520 --> 38:23.040
Oh my god, something's gone wrong.

38:26.800 --> 38:27.360
Rushus.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.800
Rushus Primstein.

38:31.360 --> 38:33.520
Rushus Primstein asks,

38:34.960 --> 38:37.920
what is your favorite wizard swear?

38:37.920 --> 38:46.800
What is your favorite wizard swear?

38:50.320 --> 38:53.360
Is there any context to the question, Griffin?

38:53.360 --> 38:54.480
Of course not.

38:58.080 --> 39:00.960
Oh, I think I really like fuck.

39:00.960 --> 39:06.240
Oh, fuck, my spell fucked up.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.800
My fucking wand is broken.

39:10.800 --> 39:12.640
Oh, my fucking wand again.

39:12.640 --> 39:14.240
Where's my fucking cauldron?

39:16.160 --> 39:18.240
Fucking Snape's right in my ass.

39:18.240 --> 39:20.080
Fucking Snape's on my dick.

39:20.080 --> 39:20.480
God.

39:23.680 --> 39:25.440
Merlin's beard.

39:25.440 --> 39:26.880
Fuck, it's hot in here.

39:26.880 --> 39:30.960
Why do y'all have to wear these fucking robes?

39:30.960 --> 39:33.040
Merlin's fucking beard.

39:34.880 --> 39:36.320
Fucking hate this whole castle.

39:37.520 --> 39:42.320
Hey, Jimmy, can you fucking stop extinguishing the lights with your fucking smell?

39:42.320 --> 39:43.040
It sucks.

39:43.760 --> 39:44.560
We're in a castle.

39:44.560 --> 39:45.920
It's fucking dark.

39:45.920 --> 39:48.160
It's fucking dark all the time.

39:48.160 --> 39:49.200
Come on.

39:49.200 --> 39:51.440
Oh, fucking dragon farts.

39:51.440 --> 39:59.120
Get your fucking rat out of my bedroom.

39:59.120 --> 40:01.360
Zippity zappity fuckity doo.

40:03.360 --> 40:05.600
Why are wands so fucking thin?

40:05.600 --> 40:07.360
I break them every week.

40:07.360 --> 40:09.280
I hate this fucking job.

40:09.280 --> 40:10.960
No, I don't want a fucking butterbeer.

40:10.960 --> 40:12.720
Can I just get a Miller Highlight?

40:12.720 --> 40:13.360
Fuck.

40:13.360 --> 40:14.400
Jesus Christ.

40:17.440 --> 40:19.040
No, the candy's alive.

40:19.040 --> 40:20.800
I bought a fucking chocolate frog.

40:20.800 --> 40:22.320
I bought a frog.

40:22.320 --> 40:25.120
It's inside me moving the fuck around.

40:25.680 --> 40:28.560
All the pictures fucking move, it's creeping me the fuck out.

40:30.640 --> 40:32.160
I just want to go home.

40:32.160 --> 40:34.640
I ate a jelly bean and it was period.

40:34.640 --> 40:37.200
I'm fucking out of Wizard Town.

40:37.200 --> 40:39.760
I'm a guy now and I work at SitGo.

40:39.760 --> 40:43.120
You have tried seven fucking times to levitate yourself.

40:44.240 --> 40:48.640
Just get a fucking ladder and go up there and get the soda.

40:48.640 --> 40:51.920
It's Wingardium fucking Leviosa, all right?

40:51.920 --> 40:53.920
How many fucking times do I-

40:53.920 --> 40:54.960
Muggle fucker.

40:56.560 --> 40:57.600
What are you fucking me?

40:57.600 --> 40:58.960
We don't even have ladders.

40:59.600 --> 41:01.440
I hate this fucking castle.

41:01.440 --> 41:04.160
Buy a ladder that costs 15 fucking dollars.

41:06.240 --> 41:10.480
Generate one out of pure wishes or whatever the fuck you idiots do.

41:10.480 --> 41:12.720
This ladder goes in six directions.

41:12.720 --> 41:13.920
I don't- I want up.

41:13.920 --> 41:15.440
Why the fuck would I want that?

41:15.440 --> 41:16.800
The staircases move.

41:16.800 --> 41:19.680
Well, that's poor fucking planning, isn't it?

41:19.680 --> 41:20.240
Isn't it?

41:20.240 --> 41:23.360
I could get on a staircase to somewhere and end up fucking somewhere else.

41:23.360 --> 41:27.680
What do you mean there's a giant dog upstairs guarding a fucking like trap door?

41:27.680 --> 41:29.680
I'm just trying to find the bathroom.

41:29.680 --> 41:30.720
I hate this place.

41:30.720 --> 41:34.240
I don't want to owl fucking next to my bed all night long.

41:34.240 --> 41:36.320
There's shit all over my nightstand.

41:36.320 --> 41:37.600
Are you gonna clean this up?

41:37.600 --> 41:39.600
He just fucking stares at me.

41:39.600 --> 41:42.640
There's a fucking wizarding war going on?

41:42.640 --> 41:44.800
I'm gonna go get my fucking GED.

41:44.800 --> 41:46.080
This is ridiculous.

41:46.080 --> 41:46.720
Yes.

41:46.720 --> 41:47.760
Quick question.

41:47.760 --> 41:50.560
Nobody mentioned this to my fucking parents.

41:50.560 --> 41:57.040
When you put me on a train and ship me off here, there's a fucking every day my life would be under threat.

41:57.040 --> 41:58.160
I don't know magic.

41:58.800 --> 42:01.040
I'm just trying to learn some fucking potions.

42:01.040 --> 42:01.920
I don't know magic.

42:01.920 --> 42:05.040
How about for the first three years, you give me a gun?

42:07.040 --> 42:12.320
You give me a fucking gun so I can shoot the bad wizards when they're not looking.

42:12.320 --> 42:13.360
How about that?

42:13.360 --> 42:15.680
Because apparently you cannot protect me.

42:15.680 --> 42:19.360
Half the people at this fucking school are evil and you don't know it.

42:20.320 --> 42:20.720
What's that?

42:20.720 --> 42:23.520
You guys don't don't play football either?

42:23.520 --> 42:27.120
How am I supposed to ball 24-7 on the Quidditch court?

42:27.120 --> 42:27.440
Fuck.

42:27.440 --> 42:29.840
Oh, everything here wants to kill me.

42:29.840 --> 42:34.640
There's like giant plants that want to kill me and like if I fall off my fucking broomstick,

42:34.640 --> 42:37.200
I'm dead and people are fucking cursing me.

42:37.200 --> 42:37.920
Okay, great.

42:37.920 --> 42:40.080
In high school, I might get bullied.

42:40.080 --> 42:41.360
Hate this place.

42:41.360 --> 42:42.480
Hate this fucking school.

42:42.480 --> 42:48.640
It's more like dog narts.

42:48.640 --> 42:50.720
Nailed it.

42:52.240 --> 42:52.720
Solid.

42:53.680 --> 42:54.640
I have a question here.

42:54.640 --> 42:59.600
I work in a cafe where customers frequently linger 30 to 40 minutes after we've closed.

42:59.600 --> 43:03.680
I frequently find myself sweeping and mopping around them while they point it.

43:03.680 --> 43:07.920
I thought that said moping at first and that is also yes.

43:07.920 --> 43:14.720
And also that I find myself sweeping and mopping around them while they plainly ignore me and

43:14.720 --> 43:15.680
keep chatting.

43:15.680 --> 43:19.600
My boss does not allow us to directly tell them to leave.

43:19.600 --> 43:22.640
What are some good passive aggressive ways to give them the boot?

43:22.640 --> 43:24.560
And that's from I just want to fucking go home.

43:24.560 --> 43:24.880
P.S.

43:24.880 --> 43:26.880
The song Closing Time is not on our storage playlist.

43:26.880 --> 43:29.200
That was literally on the tip of my tongue.

43:29.200 --> 43:29.440
Shit.

43:30.240 --> 43:31.040
Here's what you do.

43:31.920 --> 43:32.880
Sing Closing Time.

43:32.880 --> 43:34.640
Do just an acoustic cover right there on the spot.

43:34.640 --> 43:38.720
An acoustic cover of Closing Time you walk right up to and you say, hey, hey guys.

43:38.720 --> 43:40.960
Where are the cool parties this weekend?

43:40.960 --> 43:45.920
And then just keep asking them about cool parties this weekend until they decide to

43:45.920 --> 43:46.800
leave because that no one wants to hang out.

43:46.800 --> 43:48.160
What do you guys watch on Hulu?

43:48.720 --> 43:51.200
Hey, have you guys watched anything on Hulu lately?

43:52.800 --> 43:54.080
Tell me about what you're watching.

43:54.080 --> 43:55.040
What are you watching?

43:55.040 --> 43:55.360
Huh?

43:55.360 --> 43:58.240
You checked out that what that Galavant?

43:58.240 --> 43:59.040
That's a good one.

43:59.040 --> 44:00.960
Hey, have you guys seen Arrow?

44:00.960 --> 44:03.840
Hey, who wants to talk about Arrow?

44:05.200 --> 44:09.520
Hey, I go up to them and just keep at look.

44:09.520 --> 44:10.960
You get to introduce it like this.

44:10.960 --> 44:13.200
Hey guys, we're starting to close up.

44:13.200 --> 44:15.360
Just wondering if you needed anything, right?

44:15.360 --> 44:19.600
And then you're going to ask them if they need anything like once every minute.

44:20.560 --> 44:21.760
Just keep walking by going.

44:21.760 --> 44:22.720
You guys still good?

44:22.720 --> 44:23.520
Do you need anything?

44:23.520 --> 44:24.560
OK, great.

44:24.560 --> 44:26.720
The real answer is just to unplug the router.

44:27.760 --> 44:28.080
Right?

44:28.080 --> 44:31.120
10 PM rolls around, unplug the fucking router.

44:31.120 --> 44:34.720
And they turn into ash and blow out the front door.

44:34.720 --> 44:35.680
Whoosh, there they go.

44:37.440 --> 44:42.720
Or you could say at 10.01, put up a sign that says at 10.01,

44:42.720 --> 44:46.720
I will be loudly reciting some of my favorite bits from the Big Bang Theory

44:46.720 --> 44:48.160
in the middle of the room.

44:48.160 --> 44:49.360
And then 10.01 rolls around.

44:49.360 --> 44:51.600
You go out the first time and just like, hey, everybody, Bazinga.

44:51.600 --> 44:52.240
It's great to see you.

44:53.120 --> 44:54.880
And then Sheldon says.

44:54.880 --> 44:56.000
Then Sheldon's like.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.520
And oh, and here's what you have to know about it.

44:57.520 --> 44:59.040
Oh, so they like live together.

44:59.040 --> 44:59.520
They're roommates.

44:59.520 --> 45:00.560
Have you guys seen the show?

45:00.560 --> 45:04.080
OK, so imagine it's two kind of awkward dudes, right?

45:04.080 --> 45:04.880
I like math.

45:04.880 --> 45:06.000
I prefer science.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.280
Bazinga, Bazinga, Bazinga, and Bazinga to you.

45:11.040 --> 45:11.600
Are you wearing a flash costume?

45:11.600 --> 45:12.640
Have you heard the good news?

45:13.520 --> 45:15.120
Are you wearing a flash costume?

45:15.120 --> 45:16.640
Yes, I do it every episode.

45:16.640 --> 45:18.720
If only I could math love.

45:21.760 --> 45:25.440
If only love was something I could calculate with my science calculator.

45:25.440 --> 45:27.920
Bazinga.

45:27.920 --> 45:28.960
Bazinga, my brother.

45:30.080 --> 45:35.520
Where did you find the DVD for a poorly translated Big Bang Theory?

45:35.520 --> 45:37.600
And Bazinga is the plural of Bazinga.

45:38.160 --> 45:38.960
Everybody knows that.

45:38.960 --> 45:39.440
No, I'm sorry.

45:39.440 --> 45:40.800
It is a murder of Bazinga.

45:42.240 --> 45:42.800
I wish.

45:42.800 --> 45:44.240
Oh, God, if only.

45:44.240 --> 45:45.040
If only.

45:45.040 --> 45:46.720
Shonda Rhimes wrote that episode.

45:46.720 --> 45:49.680
Shonda Rhimes wrote the bomb episode of Big Bang Theory.

45:49.680 --> 45:50.240
Just kidding.

45:50.240 --> 45:51.040
They're all bombs.

45:51.040 --> 45:51.840
Y'all want to Yahoo?

45:52.640 --> 45:52.880
Yeah.

45:53.520 --> 45:54.560
Drop the bomb, Chaz.

45:54.560 --> 45:59.360
This Yajuru was sent in by Level 9000 Yajuru Shaman Drew Davenport.

45:59.360 --> 45:59.920
Thank you, Drew.

45:59.920 --> 46:03.600
It's by Yajuru Answers user, Blaze, who asks.

46:05.040 --> 46:08.160
My name is Blaze Props.

46:09.600 --> 46:11.680
I'm 15 and a male.

46:12.720 --> 46:18.480
I wanted to know if anyone knew of a better, more professional name for Blaze.

46:20.640 --> 46:23.360
I've gone through my entire life with people asking me,

46:23.360 --> 46:24.800
what's wrong with my parents?

46:24.800 --> 46:26.320
Or are your parents potheads?

46:26.320 --> 46:27.760
Or do you smoke weed?

46:27.760 --> 46:28.800
Of course I smoke weed.

46:28.800 --> 46:31.360
I mean, my name is fucking Blaze, LMAO.

46:32.560 --> 46:32.880
What?

46:34.400 --> 46:36.640
Blaze literally don't understand the question.

46:36.640 --> 46:39.760
He's looking for a better, more professional name.

46:39.760 --> 46:40.640
He's rebranding.

46:41.520 --> 46:42.320
Maybe Blaz?

46:42.880 --> 46:44.000
I don't know.

46:44.000 --> 46:44.880
That's nothing.

46:44.880 --> 46:45.840
How about Blazze?

46:46.880 --> 46:48.560
That doesn't seem professional, though, does it?

46:48.560 --> 46:50.160
It seems like you're not going to take this job very seriously.

46:50.160 --> 46:52.080
Yeah, it definitely seems like he doesn't care.

46:52.080 --> 46:57.600
So he's 15 and he's looking for a more professional, like,

46:57.600 --> 46:59.120
like nom de plume, I guess.

47:00.000 --> 47:03.520
I think he's looking for, like, a mutated version of his name.

47:03.520 --> 47:06.640
Kind of like how, like, Charles can turn into Chuck,

47:06.640 --> 47:09.120
even though those only have, like, two goddamn letters in common.

47:09.920 --> 47:12.320
I'm looking for Bill.

47:12.320 --> 47:13.600
He could go by Blade.

47:14.560 --> 47:18.960
Well, I don't think that's going to be much better.

47:18.960 --> 47:22.240
Nobody's going to ask if your parents smoke weed if your name's Blade.

47:22.240 --> 47:24.000
They might ask if you kill vampires.

47:24.560 --> 47:26.960
And then you're like, yeah, of course I kill vampires.

47:26.960 --> 47:30.240
My name's Blade, L-L-O-M-O, whatever he said.

47:31.280 --> 47:32.800
L-F-O, that's right, Travis.

47:32.800 --> 47:35.120
What if he said, my name is Blazer?

47:35.120 --> 47:37.520
And then that seems more powerful to me.

47:37.520 --> 47:40.480
And it's like an active verb, you know?

47:40.480 --> 47:44.080
Yeah, and that could mean, like, he is one who blazes.

47:44.080 --> 47:47.280
Or he's wearing a professional-looking sport jacket.

47:47.280 --> 47:48.080
Exactly.

47:48.080 --> 47:49.440
That's exactly what I'm saying.

47:49.440 --> 47:50.480
My name is Blazer.

47:50.480 --> 47:51.680
This is my dog.

47:51.680 --> 47:52.320
Necktie.

47:52.320 --> 47:54.000
I brought him into this job interview.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.200
I'm 15 years old.

47:55.200 --> 47:55.600
What's that?

47:55.600 --> 47:57.200
I can't work yet.

47:57.200 --> 47:57.920
Ah, shit.

47:57.920 --> 47:58.400
What's that?

47:58.400 --> 47:59.280
I need to leave?

47:59.280 --> 47:59.680
Okay.

47:59.680 --> 48:01.040
Thank you very much for your time.

48:01.040 --> 48:04.880
No matter what, if doing a comedy podcast has taught me anything,

48:05.520 --> 48:09.440
no matter what your last name is, people will find a way to tie it to weed.

48:11.120 --> 48:13.120
Look at poor Humphrey Bogart.

48:13.120 --> 48:16.720
He thought he could make it through life that way, but nope, every single time.

48:16.720 --> 48:18.400
Hi, I'm Humphrey Bogart.

48:18.400 --> 48:21.600
Ah, well, make sure you pass it when I'm around.

48:21.600 --> 48:23.600
Or look at those poor Doobie brothers.

48:23.600 --> 48:25.440
No, look at the poor Doobie brothers.

48:25.440 --> 48:30.720
Can I just say, I do not think that's a problem that Humphrey Bogart, Humphrey Bogart?

48:30.720 --> 48:32.320
Humphrey Bogart suffers from.

48:32.880 --> 48:35.680
I, I, well, not anymore.

48:35.680 --> 48:40.000
But can you imagine how bad of a weed sharer you have to be

48:40.000 --> 48:43.840
for people to name the act of not sharing weed after you?

48:43.840 --> 48:47.600
Well, Humphrey Bogart was notoriously bad at sharing.

48:47.600 --> 48:49.360
Apparently, just weed though.

48:49.360 --> 48:51.360
Anything else, he'd give me the shirt off his back

48:51.360 --> 48:54.000
unless he had some weed in the pocket of his shirt,

48:54.000 --> 48:56.960
in which case he would keep it on and smoke all of it in front of you.

48:56.960 --> 48:59.840
Is there an opposite of Bogart?

48:59.840 --> 49:02.480
Which means somebody that is constantly giving out free weed,

49:02.480 --> 49:05.520
and if not, I would like to nominate my old roommate, Eric.

49:07.600 --> 49:10.400
Wait, so you would say like, thank you for Eric-ing that weed?

49:11.440 --> 49:13.280
It doesn't roll off the tongue, really.

49:13.280 --> 49:14.720
Bro, you really Eric-ed me.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.200
But that's a good thing.

49:17.200 --> 49:18.080
It doesn't, I know.

49:18.640 --> 49:19.600
It's a celebration.

49:19.600 --> 49:20.080
I'm saying, I'm...

49:20.880 --> 49:22.320
What if they, okay, okay.

49:22.320 --> 49:24.960
Maybe Eric-ing is you force, you force them to, hey.

49:24.960 --> 49:25.760
No, no, no, no.

49:25.760 --> 49:26.560
Come on, you Eric-ed me.

49:26.560 --> 49:28.320
I got a drug test tomorrow.

49:28.320 --> 49:30.560
No, Eric, Eric would never do that.

49:30.560 --> 49:32.880
He would just, it was always there if you needed it.

49:32.880 --> 49:34.320
I'm not saying it sounds the best.

49:34.320 --> 49:36.480
I'm saying we could definitely find better words for it.

49:36.480 --> 49:39.040
But this, I mean, the shoe fits.

49:39.040 --> 49:43.600
What about broguard?

49:43.600 --> 49:46.160
Well, that might get confusing when someone has to, I'm sorry.

49:46.800 --> 49:48.720
Did you say I was broguarding it or broguarding it?

49:48.720 --> 49:49.440
Broguarding it.

49:50.960 --> 49:52.960
I think you could figure that out from context clues.

49:52.960 --> 49:55.040
Look in your heart.

49:55.040 --> 49:55.760
What do you think?

49:55.760 --> 49:56.720
How do you feel you're doing?

50:00.560 --> 50:03.760
Hey, thanks everybody for listening to our comedy podcast,

50:04.320 --> 50:05.840
My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

50:05.840 --> 50:12.720
Uh, right now, before we do any of our other, uh, let me horseshit, uh, we want to remind you that

50:12.720 --> 50:15.360
we're going to be coming to the Pacific Northwest and we want to see you there.

50:15.360 --> 50:16.400
We're doing a show in Portland.

50:16.400 --> 50:17.120
That's sold out.

50:17.120 --> 50:21.920
But if you're near Portland, you can come to our show in Seattle, which is just a,

50:21.920 --> 50:23.040
it's just a short drive away.

50:23.040 --> 50:24.400
We're making the drive.

50:24.400 --> 50:25.520
I don't see why you can't.

50:25.520 --> 50:30.000
That's mb, bit.ly forward slash mb mb am Seattle.

50:30.000 --> 50:35.280
We're also going to, uh, the night after that, which will be August 30th, the 29th,

50:35.280 --> 50:37.920
the 29th on Saturday is, uh, Seattle.

50:37.920 --> 50:41.680
That's actually the Saturday night of PAX, if prime, if you're going to be around for that,

50:41.680 --> 50:43.520
uh, you should come to our show.

50:43.520 --> 50:46.960
Uh, and also the night after that, August 30th, we're going to be in Vancouver.

50:46.960 --> 50:52.080
That's bit.ly van mb mb am to buy tickets.

50:52.080 --> 50:54.640
It's our first international show.

50:54.640 --> 50:56.720
It's going to get crazy.

50:56.720 --> 50:58.720
We're going to exchange money.

50:58.720 --> 51:00.880
We're going to show our passports.

51:00.880 --> 51:02.160
It's going to be wild.

51:02.160 --> 51:04.080
My baby's never left the nation before.

51:04.080 --> 51:06.000
So it'll be our first time in a foreign land.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.600
Hopefully they let her.

51:07.600 --> 51:07.920
Yeah.

51:07.920 --> 51:12.400
The focus group is like, y'all got to get out of America and test the international

51:12.400 --> 51:13.520
waters out there.

51:13.520 --> 51:18.800
And I said, okay, but it has to be walking distance back to America.

51:18.800 --> 51:25.040
One thing that I would say is that the seating for, uh, the Seattle and Vancouver shows are

51:25.040 --> 51:26.160
reserved seating.

51:26.160 --> 51:31.680
But right now, if you act fast, you can reserve a box at the Vancouver show.

51:31.680 --> 51:36.160
How cool would you be if you had like a formal box?

51:36.160 --> 51:38.880
And listen, if you're in a box, I'm going to be playing to the boxes.

51:38.880 --> 51:40.000
You don't need to worry about that.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.360
You're going to be my dog pound.

51:41.360 --> 51:44.720
I want to be, I'm going to be a lot of material just for the boxes.

51:45.920 --> 51:47.200
A lot of three pointers.

51:47.200 --> 51:47.920
A lot of three pointers.

51:47.920 --> 51:51.200
We'll wear hats with stuff on top of the hats that only you'll be able to see.

51:52.160 --> 51:53.440
A lot of deep buckets.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.720
I want to just take a second to thank nature box.

51:58.720 --> 52:03.040

52:11.760 --> 52:15.040
Also want to thank John Roderick and the long winters for these for our theme song.

52:15.040 --> 52:17.840
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

52:17.840 --> 52:18.640
Super good album.

52:19.200 --> 52:20.880
Perfect album for summertime fun.

52:20.880 --> 52:24.320
If you're going out on a boat on a body of water, you're going to need this album to

52:24.320 --> 52:24.880

The stunts are a little too wet.

54:38.080 --> 54:40.080
And God, we God damn it.

54:40.080 --> 54:43.440
