00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:50.880
Hello everyone, and welcome to the event you've waited for all year long.

00:50.880 --> 00:55.680
The season finale of My Brother, My Brother and Me is here.

00:55.680 --> 01:01.840
I'm both of your dads. I've been both your dads this whole time.

01:03.280 --> 01:05.600
Griffin reveals an embarrassing secret.

01:05.600 --> 01:09.600
It's not embarrassing. I'm so proud of you two. I love you so much. Every week,

01:09.600 --> 01:13.280
you come out here and you do your best, and I love you so much, and I'm your dad.

01:13.280 --> 01:16.080
Wait, so then who's the guy that's been claiming to be our dad?

01:16.080 --> 01:16.960
He's your grandpa.

01:19.440 --> 01:21.680
Who will live? Who will die?

01:21.680 --> 01:27.520
We all, I mean, we're all just sitting down. We all live. Who will be sick?

01:28.160 --> 01:29.280
Um, Travis.

01:29.280 --> 01:30.960
Who will get sleepy?

01:30.960 --> 01:33.200
I would bet Travis. I know this about-

01:33.200 --> 01:35.600
Who will suffer from ennui?

01:35.600 --> 01:38.000
I know this about you two because I'm your proud dad,

01:38.000 --> 01:40.320
and Travis gets sick more than you, Justin.

01:40.320 --> 01:41.040
That is true.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.160
My dad is younger than I am.

01:44.160 --> 01:45.280
Yeah, it's one of those Terminators.

01:45.280 --> 01:52.320
Reality bends around on itself, and the advice show for the Modron era.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.240
I can't believe people are going to have to wait all

01:55.520 --> 01:59.120
summer long for these answers to be revealed.

01:59.120 --> 02:04.160
To be fair, we'll do our reruns during the summer, do a couple of summer specials.

02:04.160 --> 02:04.800
Yeah, we gots to get it up.

02:04.800 --> 02:08.960
Little bitches and me got a bunch of bullshit about ghosts and horses and shit,

02:08.960 --> 02:10.400
and it's like, I've heard this one before.

02:10.400 --> 02:14.160
We gots to get our episode count up to a hundo so we can get Cindy.

02:14.160 --> 02:15.360
That's true.

02:15.360 --> 02:20.240
We can do a couple episodes over the summer where the few of us go to work at a beach resort,

02:22.800 --> 02:25.200
so it's a little bit out of the normal setting,

02:25.200 --> 02:29.200
but then one of us ends up falling in love with the resort owner's daughter,

02:29.200 --> 02:32.800
and then hilarity ensues because she thinks that we're just a preppy,

02:32.800 --> 02:34.880
but we think that she's really stuck up.

02:34.880 --> 02:38.480
I think in my fiction here, it's become that all three of us are in love with her at once.

02:39.680 --> 02:43.520
The good news is that although my brother and my brother and me is going away for the summer,

02:43.520 --> 02:45.920
it will be replaced by a mid-season replacement.

02:45.920 --> 02:48.560
It's a reality dating show called My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

02:49.760 --> 02:50.880
How does that one work?

02:51.520 --> 02:53.920
Now, that is a very different program.

02:53.920 --> 02:56.000
I think you're all still really going to enjoy it.

02:58.240 --> 03:01.680
There's a lot of scintillation and a lot of-

03:01.680 --> 03:02.240
Ventilation.

03:02.240 --> 03:04.320
Just ventilation and nausea.

03:04.320 --> 03:09.680
It's been perforated to allow the smoke that we generate,

03:09.680 --> 03:13.520
just our sexy smoke that we generate during the dating show portion of the show.

03:14.240 --> 03:17.200
Got to let that out or else it's a real health hazard.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.000
We should introduce ourselves.

03:20.880 --> 03:22.320
My name is Justin McElroy.

03:22.320 --> 03:25.200
I will be mid-season replaced by Yolo Swaggins,

03:25.760 --> 03:28.720
but for now, I'm Justin McElroy.

03:28.720 --> 03:33.040
I'm Travis McElroy, and I plan on staying on as executive producer.

03:33.840 --> 03:37.920
I'm Griffin McElroy, and yeah, I don't have shit to do.

03:37.920 --> 03:40.080
I really don't have shit to do this summer.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.280
This summer's starting to look like a bummer.

03:43.280 --> 03:46.160
Okay, let's get into the advice actually because I'm ready.

03:46.160 --> 03:46.960
My body's ready.

03:48.080 --> 03:53.200
What is the statute of limitations on apologizing for a dumb offense given to a friend?

03:53.760 --> 03:56.000
I dated a friend's ex a couple years ago.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.280
I had her permission.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.800
She seemed happy for us.

03:58.800 --> 04:03.120
Unfortunately, the relationship was a train wreck and it ended badly.

04:03.760 --> 04:05.680
Oh, sorry, I handled it badly.

04:05.680 --> 04:10.320
Uh, she and this guy are still good friends, and she is still one of my besties,

04:10.320 --> 04:13.040
but I feel like I've never made amends for what an idiot I was.

04:14.640 --> 04:19.200
Would it be super weird to apologize to her for it now,

04:20.080 --> 04:23.280
or should I just let sleeping dogs lie?

04:23.280 --> 04:24.400
That's from Monster Engine.

04:25.200 --> 04:28.480
Jeez, I think it's, I think you done fucked up.

04:28.480 --> 04:33.440
I don't, I think that that is the kind of thing that you just, apologies?

04:33.440 --> 04:36.800
No, wait, but here's my con- I'm confused.

04:38.080 --> 04:43.440
I'm confused because it sounds like you want to apologize for your, to your friend

04:44.720 --> 04:48.560
because your relationship with somebody else went badly.

04:48.560 --> 04:52.080
No, no, they want to apologize for their friend for dating their ex.

04:52.080 --> 04:55.120
No, her, her friend was totally cool with her dating her.

04:55.120 --> 04:55.920
She had her permission.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.520
Yeah, sure she was.

04:57.520 --> 05:02.080
Well, I think the problem is that the relationship didn't end so hot,

05:02.080 --> 05:03.600
and it may have put strain on them.

05:05.520 --> 05:08.800
By and large, I usually think apologizing is a good thing.

05:08.800 --> 05:13.040
I mean, it may be awkward for you, but I think people appreciate it because,

05:13.040 --> 05:15.680
I mean, worst case, one of two scenarios will happen.

05:15.680 --> 05:19.440
Either A, they've been harboring resentment this entire time,

05:19.440 --> 05:21.920
and they'll be relieved to finally get that off their chest,

05:21.920 --> 05:25.280
or they won't think it's a big deal and you'll be relieved

05:25.280 --> 05:28.560
because you'll find out that they didn't care as much as you thought they did.

05:28.560 --> 05:31.520
And either way, it's, it's, I think that's a W for you.

05:31.520 --> 05:34.160
But if they burn your house down,

05:35.840 --> 05:38.560
and then they're like, sorry, bro, that was out of line.

05:39.200 --> 05:42.160
Is that really gonna, is that really gonna patch things up?

05:42.160 --> 05:44.400
Is that really gonna, gonna suit you?

05:44.400 --> 05:47.760
Do you mean metaphorically, or do you mean like by apologizing to your friend,

05:47.760 --> 05:50.080
you'll make them burn your house down?

05:50.080 --> 05:52.320
I'm saying there are certain offenses.

05:53.520 --> 05:57.520
And burning their house down is tantamount to dating their ex.

05:57.520 --> 05:59.760
Now, Griffin, am I, am I correct in my assumption

05:59.760 --> 06:02.480
that if a friend of yours burned your house down,

06:02.480 --> 06:04.640
you would prefer they just look at you and say,

06:05.440 --> 06:08.080
guess, guess these things, these things happen, eh?

06:08.080 --> 06:10.480
How about this, actions speak louder than words.

06:10.480 --> 06:12.320
I don't want to hear, I'm sorry, I want to see it.

06:12.320 --> 06:13.600
I want you to build me a new house,

06:13.600 --> 06:16.800
or I want you to go, go buy me a key lime pie or something.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.120
Do something sweet for me.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.400
Build me a new ex-boyfriend.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.320
Build him, build him for me.

06:22.320 --> 06:23.840
Better, faster, stronger.

06:23.840 --> 06:27.120
Maybe it'll be like when they built robot stuff on.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.000
Yeah, we have the technology.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.960
Man, that was fucked up, that plot line.

06:33.840 --> 06:37.920
He breathed life into an inanimate object.

06:37.920 --> 06:40.160
Urkel like played God.

06:40.160 --> 06:43.920
That's like some Isaac Asimov, like ethical shit,

06:43.920 --> 06:45.200
and he just ignored all of it.

06:45.200 --> 06:48.080
His science was irresponsible, is what I'm saying.

06:48.080 --> 06:51.280
He was so obsessed with whether or not he could,

06:51.280 --> 06:57.520
he didn't stop to think, did I do that?

06:57.520 --> 07:00.240
I have a suggestion, Monster Engine,

07:00.240 --> 07:06.160
and it's that three words, I think, in vino veritas.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.240
You're saying get this, Travis, this is terrible.

07:08.240 --> 07:09.680
No, no, no, no.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.920
I'm saying share a bottle of wine with your friend

07:11.920 --> 07:14.160
in a hangout and let it like come up.

07:14.160 --> 07:17.840
That's like, well, that way it's not like out of the blue

07:17.840 --> 07:19.920
or anything like you're hanging out and you could do like,

07:19.920 --> 07:21.520
you know, by the way, and you'll feel

07:21.520 --> 07:22.480
a little bit more comfortable,

07:22.480 --> 07:23.760
they'll feel a little bit more comfortable.

07:23.760 --> 07:25.600
You guys can have a good cry about it and get it over with.

07:25.600 --> 07:30.160
No, no, no, no, no, because there is a high probability

07:30.160 --> 07:35.120
that this particular operation will go sideways

07:35.120 --> 07:37.920
and you're going to need all of your faculties

07:37.920 --> 07:39.280
if you're gonna get out of that one.

07:39.280 --> 07:39.600
Exactly.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.320
You could do the like dump your cup into the potted plant

07:42.320 --> 07:43.360
while she's drinking.

07:43.360 --> 07:44.880
Yeah, you take the sips.

07:44.880 --> 07:47.840
I'm saying there's also the punch restraints in your brain.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.360
Those get loosened up.

07:49.360 --> 07:53.840
Envino punchitas is the alternate,

07:53.840 --> 07:55.600
the flip side of that Latin coin.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.240
Yeah, that's fair.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.160
That was also my favorite Jason Statham movie.

07:58.880 --> 08:00.480
God, I would watch that movie.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.640
I'm gonna need a bottle of wine

08:02.640 --> 08:04.720
if I'm gonna get us out of this one.

08:04.720 --> 08:07.840
My punch receptors, my punch blockers,

08:07.840 --> 08:09.680
they are engaged by the government.

08:09.680 --> 08:11.600
Well, why doesn't he just break us out of here?

08:11.600 --> 08:13.600
Can't you see this man is sober?

08:13.600 --> 08:14.560
He's sober.

08:14.560 --> 08:15.520
He has a church house.

08:15.520 --> 08:16.640
He needs booze.

08:16.640 --> 08:17.680
Give me those apples.

08:17.680 --> 08:20.640
We're gonna put them in this water for like two months.

08:21.520 --> 08:22.560
Just hold out.

08:22.560 --> 08:23.600
I got this.

08:23.600 --> 08:24.640
Is that Windex?

08:24.640 --> 08:25.200
Crikey.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.360
We're getting out of here.

08:30.800 --> 08:31.440
Shit, sorry.

08:32.320 --> 08:34.800
I apologize for everything that's happened.

08:34.800 --> 08:36.880
Griffin, you have a Yahoo answer.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.480
I only got a few this week.

08:38.480 --> 08:39.280
I'm gonna be honest.

08:39.280 --> 08:40.640
I appreciate the people who sent them in.

08:40.640 --> 08:41.680
Thank you so much.

08:41.680 --> 08:43.360
I had to dip in the back catalog though.

08:44.240 --> 08:46.160
My boy Ira Ray, nowhere to be seen.

08:46.160 --> 08:46.880
Jacob Locker.

08:46.880 --> 08:48.000
Jacob Locker might be dead.

08:49.680 --> 08:51.760
Has anyone checked his Jacob Locker?

08:51.760 --> 08:52.640
Has anyone checked?

08:52.640 --> 08:54.880
He might be inside of his Jacob Locker.

08:55.680 --> 08:56.800
Or he keeps his thoughts.

08:57.600 --> 08:59.520
This Yahoo was sent in by Mary Turner.

08:59.520 --> 09:00.560
Thanks, Mary.

09:00.560 --> 09:02.960
It's by Yahoo Answers user Juliette, who asks,

09:04.720 --> 09:09.360
a boy at school got dacked, pants pulled down today at school.

09:09.360 --> 09:10.320
Was he still sad?

09:12.640 --> 09:15.600
A boy today at school got dacked, pants pulled down

09:15.600 --> 09:19.360
in front of everyone and he was crying and it's the guy I like.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.720
He was crying, then he stopped.

09:22.720 --> 09:24.800
Then he was crying again, but then he stopped.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.280
And when school finished, I said to him,

09:27.280 --> 09:28.400
I hope you feel better.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.320
I have sort of gone through the same thing.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.040
I've heard that boys are stronger than girls

09:33.040 --> 09:34.160
with these kind of things,

09:34.720 --> 09:36.880
but would he still be sad on the inside?

09:39.200 --> 09:41.440
I've never heard dacked before.

09:41.440 --> 09:41.940
No.

09:41.940 --> 09:42.440
Oh.

09:44.900 --> 09:46.180
You know, I got dacked once.

09:46.180 --> 09:47.300
I'm still sad about it.

09:48.020 --> 09:50.820
Being a kid is the absolute pits, man.

09:50.820 --> 09:52.100
They are savages.

09:52.900 --> 09:54.420
If that happened in the adult world,

09:54.420 --> 09:57.460
that would be the flashpoint of a major trial.

09:57.460 --> 09:57.940
Exactly.

09:57.940 --> 09:59.700
It would be everybody's going to court.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.860
It happens in a life of a kid.

10:01.860 --> 10:03.060
That's Tuesday.

10:03.060 --> 10:04.740
I have some kid that's fucked up.

10:04.740 --> 10:05.940
I've never heard a phrase like that,

10:05.940 --> 10:07.460
but that's really messed up.

10:07.460 --> 10:11.700
The only bullying I ever received was it was a rainy day.

10:11.700 --> 10:15.460
I was in sixth grade and outside of school,

10:15.460 --> 10:18.900
this fucking kid I had never met before,

10:18.900 --> 10:20.340
a man I had never met,

10:21.140 --> 10:24.020
fucking ran up to me and spear tackled me into the mud

10:24.020 --> 10:26.180
and just got up, laughed, walked away.

10:26.180 --> 10:28.500
Never fucking talked to that dude ever.

10:28.500 --> 10:29.060
I don't even know-

10:29.060 --> 10:31.140
It actually turned out to be Griffin from the future.

10:31.140 --> 10:32.900
It may have been me from the future.

10:32.900 --> 10:35.460
He was stopping an assassin's bullet from killing him.

10:36.580 --> 10:37.380
Oh, man.

10:37.380 --> 10:39.380
But I remember that fucking kid.

10:39.380 --> 10:42.260
That was when I was a young man.

10:42.260 --> 10:44.500
I had been playing on a playground

10:44.500 --> 10:45.860
while our parents were doing something else.

10:46.660 --> 10:47.540
I was young.

10:47.540 --> 10:48.420
I was probably like eight.

10:49.380 --> 10:50.820
And at the end of the hangout,

10:50.820 --> 10:57.540
right before our parents came to get us,

10:58.100 --> 11:01.860
this kid who I had like barely spoken to the entire time

11:02.500 --> 11:05.700
punches me in the stomach and says,

11:05.700 --> 11:07.620
I've been wanting to do that all night,

11:07.620 --> 11:10.980
which is like awesome because it wasn't just bullying.

11:10.980 --> 11:12.980
It was like, oh, that's me.

11:12.980 --> 11:14.180
That's my steez, apparently.

11:14.180 --> 11:15.940
That's the vibe I'm putting out

11:15.940 --> 11:18.660
is that I make people secretly want to punch me

11:18.660 --> 11:22.980
until their punch blockers can't take it anymore.

11:22.980 --> 11:25.380
Isn't it nice to be wanted though, Justin?

11:25.380 --> 11:29.300
Isn't it nice to be the object of somebody's affection?

11:30.340 --> 11:32.100
Somebody else was looking across the playground

11:32.100 --> 11:33.460
and saw that kid punch you and said,

11:33.460 --> 11:34.980
I can't believe I missed my shot.

11:34.980 --> 11:36.900
Yeah, I was going to punch him.

11:36.900 --> 11:38.500
I'm going to think about that one.

11:38.500 --> 11:40.340
Hey, do you mind if I just still punch?

11:40.340 --> 11:41.060
Yeah, go ahead.

11:41.060 --> 11:42.180
To answer your question.

11:42.180 --> 11:44.100
Yes, he's still sad and he always will be.

11:44.660 --> 11:45.460
Forever.

11:45.460 --> 11:47.540
I'm still talking about this time a kid punched me.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.180
I'm 32.

11:48.180 --> 11:48.680
Exactly.

11:51.380 --> 11:57.140
But to have that happen to somebody that you're crushing on.

11:57.140 --> 11:58.180
Oh, man.

11:58.900 --> 11:59.860
What a bum.

11:59.860 --> 12:03.140
Like, what a bummer to like,

12:03.140 --> 12:06.420
if you're lusting after Dennis Quaid

12:06.420 --> 12:07.700
and you see him on the street like,

12:07.700 --> 12:10.660
oh my God, Dennis Quaid, this whole time, my whole life.

12:10.660 --> 12:13.300
I've loved you ever since I saw you in inner space.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.540
And just, I've waited for this magic moment

12:15.540 --> 12:17.540
and then someone runs up and pulls his pants down.

12:18.100 --> 12:20.100
You're like, I'm done.

12:20.100 --> 12:20.500
I'm out.

12:20.500 --> 12:21.220
Unless.

12:21.220 --> 12:22.100
Unless.

12:22.100 --> 12:22.740
Unless.

12:22.740 --> 12:24.260
The downstairs is real good.

12:24.260 --> 12:25.620
No, even that.

12:25.620 --> 12:29.060
Even that, because like, even when it's a prime pony,

12:29.860 --> 12:31.780
seeing it without-

12:31.780 --> 12:33.060
Oh, in that context?

12:33.060 --> 12:34.180
Seeing it without preparation,

12:34.180 --> 12:37.220
seeing it because someone else made it come out

12:37.940 --> 12:40.500
is like the worst that it could possibly happen.

12:41.620 --> 12:43.300
There's only one response for the kid

12:43.300 --> 12:45.780
and that has been docked in this situation

12:45.780 --> 12:47.380
is to raise his arms and scream,

12:47.380 --> 12:48.580
are you not entertained?

12:50.580 --> 12:51.460
You know that Gryffin that?

12:51.460 --> 12:53.380
It's funny you use that specific example

12:53.380 --> 12:57.540
because that happened to me when I was crushing on Randy Quaid.

12:57.540 --> 13:00.580
But the person that pulled his pants down was Randy Quaid.

13:00.580 --> 13:05.060
Yeah, so he said dingus time

13:05.060 --> 13:06.500
and then he pulled his pants down.

13:07.300 --> 13:10.020
He said, get a look at this, J. Edgar Hoover.

13:10.020 --> 13:12.500
And then he said, now we have to flee this hotel room quick.

13:13.300 --> 13:14.740
Quick, let's get out of here, Justin.

13:15.380 --> 13:16.260
And then you two fucked?

13:17.860 --> 13:19.060
Well, no, we made love.

13:20.420 --> 13:22.500
I'm pretty sure he doesn't make love.

13:22.500 --> 13:23.860
He makes plans.

13:23.860 --> 13:26.580
He makes plans to fuck and then he executes them.

13:26.580 --> 13:30.580
He executes on his strategy to make love.

13:31.620 --> 13:33.700
This poor kid is never gonna recover from this

13:33.700 --> 13:35.860
and you should probably move on to another sexual conquest.

13:35.860 --> 13:36.660
He's ruined.

13:36.660 --> 13:37.140
I'm sorry.

13:38.740 --> 13:40.100
He's permanently spoiled.

13:40.100 --> 13:41.220
But it was nice of you to say,

13:42.100 --> 13:46.340
that's a weird thing to offer somebody condolences for though.

13:46.340 --> 13:47.540
Hey, same thing.

13:47.540 --> 13:48.580
Sorry for your loss.

13:48.580 --> 13:49.700
Similar thing happened to me.

13:50.420 --> 13:52.260
Oh God, no, my pants weren't pulled down.

13:52.260 --> 13:53.220
Jesus Christ, no.

13:53.220 --> 13:55.620
I would never, listen to me.

13:55.620 --> 13:56.740
I would never recover.

13:59.220 --> 14:00.980
That's in a way that gives him permission

14:00.980 --> 14:04.500
because if he can recover, it makes him feel strong.

14:04.500 --> 14:05.940
He's not going to recover though.

14:05.940 --> 14:08.020
It's like, if you recover from getting your head cut off,

14:08.020 --> 14:09.460
you're gonna be so much stronger for it.

14:09.460 --> 14:12.260
What if this is like his superhero origin?

14:12.260 --> 14:15.220
What possible power could he have gleaned from this?

14:15.220 --> 14:16.260
The belter.

14:16.260 --> 14:18.820
Okay, so it's just like a man who wears a belt

14:18.820 --> 14:19.780
and suspenders at the same time.

14:19.780 --> 14:21.220
He wears like eight belts.

14:21.220 --> 14:23.700
Okay, and he has his weapons.

14:23.700 --> 14:25.380
He can remove one as a weapon.

14:25.380 --> 14:27.380
Ultimate irony though, the belts are so heavy

14:27.380 --> 14:28.580
that they pull his pants down.

14:29.300 --> 14:30.180
That's his weakness.

14:30.180 --> 14:32.900
If he removes more than one belt at a time,

14:32.900 --> 14:35.060
it's not enough to hold up the sheer weight of belts.

14:35.700 --> 14:38.100
We're gonna need three belts to bring this guy down.

14:38.100 --> 14:38.980
Please, the belter.

14:38.980 --> 14:41.540
I can't do that again.

14:42.260 --> 14:43.860
You know, I'm thinking about it.

14:44.980 --> 14:48.580
I think I saw a lot of people get pantsed or dacked,

14:49.700 --> 14:50.580
you know, at middle school.

14:50.580 --> 14:52.340
Please, Griffin, I'm trying to stay relevant.

14:52.340 --> 14:53.860
Please, can you stick with that?

14:53.860 --> 14:57.460
I saw tons of people get dac attacked in middle school

14:58.180 --> 15:03.060
and maybe even early high school and like church camp.

15:03.060 --> 15:05.540
And every time I saw people dac somebody,

15:06.260 --> 15:08.260
they always just pulled down their pants

15:08.260 --> 15:09.460
and not their underpants.

15:09.460 --> 15:11.380
And that seems like a kindness to me.

15:11.380 --> 15:15.460
Is there like an unwritten code that like,

15:16.020 --> 15:18.740
if you are going to dac somebody, grab light?

15:20.340 --> 15:22.900
Don't like grab two big old handfuls

15:22.900 --> 15:24.580
because you're gonna get boxers too.

15:24.580 --> 15:25.460
And if you do that,

15:25.460 --> 15:28.900
then maybe it's a defense mechanism for the attacker

15:28.900 --> 15:31.140
because they don't want to do a sex crime accidentally.

15:32.580 --> 15:36.900
That is actually in one of the appendices

15:36.900 --> 15:38.180
of the Geneva Convention.

15:39.300 --> 15:42.260
It is a war crime of middle school

15:42.260 --> 15:44.580
to pull someone's pants and underwear down.

15:44.580 --> 15:46.340
You can't be tried for that.

15:46.340 --> 15:47.620
Hey, let me ask you guys another question.

15:47.620 --> 15:48.120
Okay.

15:48.820 --> 15:50.820
I'm having a little bit of a moral dilemma.

15:50.820 --> 15:53.620
A few months ago, due to an ongoing conflict

15:53.620 --> 15:55.140
with a roommate, I had to evict her

15:56.020 --> 15:57.700
because we live in an area where it's difficult

15:57.700 --> 15:58.820
to find affordable housing.

15:58.820 --> 16:01.140
My other roommates and I allowed her cat to stay

16:01.140 --> 16:02.980
in the apartment until she could find a place

16:02.980 --> 16:04.580
where she can have the cat.

16:04.580 --> 16:07.220
Well, she just signed a lease on an apartment

16:07.220 --> 16:08.420
where she cannot have her cat

16:08.980 --> 16:10.900
and has more or less abandoned him.

16:10.900 --> 16:13.140
The worst part is the cat's owner keeps coming over

16:13.140 --> 16:15.620
to the apartment to visit her cat,

16:15.620 --> 16:17.860
which entails her hanging out in my roommate's room

16:17.860 --> 16:19.540
while she ignores the cat.

16:19.540 --> 16:21.380
She's not even paying for the cost of foods

16:21.380 --> 16:22.420
and other needs.

16:22.420 --> 16:24.100
So after my novella of a backstory,

16:24.100 --> 16:24.980
here's my question.

16:24.980 --> 16:26.660
Can I just give the cat away?

16:27.300 --> 16:29.540
Can I just start looking for a new home

16:29.540 --> 16:32.100
for this, for the most part, abandoned cat?

16:32.100 --> 16:33.700
Or do I need to give this person time

16:33.700 --> 16:34.580
to do something about it?

16:34.580 --> 16:36.980
It's been two months and no effort has been made

16:36.980 --> 16:38.500
to find a different situation for it.

16:38.500 --> 16:41.060
That's from feline frustration in Frisco.

16:42.740 --> 16:44.740
Jesus Christ.

16:44.740 --> 16:50.420
You made a tactical error, and now you have to live with it.

16:50.420 --> 16:53.220
When you do something like that, like evict somebody,

16:53.780 --> 16:55.540
you are cutting them out of your life.

16:55.540 --> 16:57.380
They knew that by leaving that cat there,

16:57.380 --> 16:58.500
they were leaving a foothold.

16:58.500 --> 16:59.060
Mm-hmm.

16:59.060 --> 17:02.100
You have to commit to cutting people out of your life.

17:02.100 --> 17:05.940
They literally might as well have just literally

17:05.940 --> 17:07.140
wedged the cat in the door,

17:07.940 --> 17:10.500
literally put the cat in between the door and doorframe.

17:10.500 --> 17:11.460
Oh, goodness.

17:12.260 --> 17:13.300
I don't know what to say.

17:13.300 --> 17:16.180
I don't think you can give someone's cat away

17:16.180 --> 17:17.300
without being the bad guy.

17:17.940 --> 17:20.340
Yeah, Justin, I think that's probably true.

17:21.780 --> 17:25.780
I don't think you're allowed to release custody

17:25.780 --> 17:28.020
of somebody else's cat to someone else.

17:28.820 --> 17:31.860
But what is the other option?

17:31.860 --> 17:35.700
I feel like there's a definite ultimatum in the water.

17:35.700 --> 17:37.620
Mr. Boots is my cat now.

17:37.620 --> 17:38.340
That's it.

17:38.340 --> 17:39.700
He is mine.

17:39.700 --> 17:43.780
Give that sweet little pussy bear sweet nuzzles and cuddles

17:43.780 --> 17:45.220
for the rest of its life.

17:45.220 --> 17:46.980
That's the other solution.

17:48.020 --> 17:49.540
I guess, but then it's like-

17:49.540 --> 17:52.100
But you don't want to pay for the life of this thing.

17:52.100 --> 17:54.020
It wasn't your choice to take on the responsibility of it.

17:54.020 --> 17:55.140
Here's what you do.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.300
Pick up that sweet little pussy bear,

17:57.300 --> 18:00.100
roll him into a little ball, and lay down on the couch,

18:00.100 --> 18:02.260
and give him little nuzzles on his button nose.

18:02.260 --> 18:03.780
You fucking dolt.

18:03.780 --> 18:04.260
That's what you do.

18:04.260 --> 18:06.820
Okay, well, Griffin, what about the custody battle

18:06.820 --> 18:08.980
like a year from now when the roommate gets a place

18:08.980 --> 18:12.100
that allows cats and she wants her cat back?

18:12.100 --> 18:12.660
Well, then-

18:12.660 --> 18:14.260
Kramer versus Kramer, baby.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.060
Kramer versus Kramer.

18:15.060 --> 18:17.940
Put that sweet little pussy bear in between the two of you,

18:17.940 --> 18:20.500
and whichever one he goes to is the owner.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.940
By the way, you've got sardines in your pockets.

18:23.940 --> 18:26.100
He's gonna come to you if you put sardines in your pockets.

18:26.100 --> 18:27.380
That's a little tip from me to you.

18:28.100 --> 18:30.980
I feel like you are within your right to call your ex-roommate

18:30.980 --> 18:34.660
and say, hey, I either need you to pay for the food and stuff,

18:34.660 --> 18:37.140
and then I'm happy to keep the cat here

18:37.140 --> 18:39.700
until Yuri will find a place that allows cats.

18:39.700 --> 18:40.980
No, that's not happening.

18:40.980 --> 18:42.740
She signed a lease on a new place.

18:42.740 --> 18:45.060
She is not going to retain custody of this cat.

18:45.620 --> 18:47.540
Okay, well, then say either pay for it,

18:47.540 --> 18:49.540
or I'm going to give her away.

18:51.140 --> 18:53.220
Why can't she just have a secret cat?

18:53.220 --> 18:53.700
Cats are-

18:55.140 --> 18:57.220
I frequently forget that I have a cat

18:57.220 --> 18:59.700
because he's fucking ghost all the time.

18:59.700 --> 19:02.340
Oh, you're saying like just let her out in the world?

19:02.980 --> 19:05.540
Or no, I mean like, no, Jesus.

19:05.540 --> 19:07.540
The cat will come back, there's lots of outdoor cats.

19:07.540 --> 19:09.620
Don't say that, that's not like putting a baby on the curb.

19:09.620 --> 19:11.380
I'm saying like, you let the cat out,

19:11.380 --> 19:13.780
cat roams the city, comes back to you whenever it wants.

19:13.780 --> 19:16.820
Yeah, he just roams San Francisco and he's fine.

19:16.820 --> 19:20.100
And you think he'll be the only cat out there?

19:20.100 --> 19:22.420
He'll just be a lone cat in San Francisco

19:22.420 --> 19:24.580
because all the other animals are inside where it's safe?

19:24.580 --> 19:26.900
Hey, Dale, I had a great day today.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.740
I took the trolley down to the pier

19:28.740 --> 19:31.540
and just walked it with some of my friends

19:31.540 --> 19:35.700
and I got picked up by a seagull.

19:35.700 --> 19:36.500
It was great.

19:36.500 --> 19:37.300
It was pretty good.

19:38.820 --> 19:40.820
This is a bad, this is a bad scene, man.

19:41.780 --> 19:42.340
The trick is-

19:42.340 --> 19:42.820
I don't know.

19:42.820 --> 19:44.260
I know this isn't much use to you now,

19:44.260 --> 19:47.140
but the trick is to not let yourself get in these kinds of situations.

19:49.140 --> 19:51.140
Write a note to yourself in the future saying,

19:51.140 --> 19:52.260
hey, remember that time?

19:52.820 --> 19:54.100
I don't think she has to do that.

19:54.100 --> 19:57.780
She has a living four-leg room around all the time.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.780
I have renamed him Burden.

19:59.780 --> 20:02.260
Come here, Burden.

20:02.260 --> 20:03.460
Is it really that expensive?

20:03.460 --> 20:06.580
Like, once the cat has gotten that first round of shots

20:06.580 --> 20:09.700
and vaccinations and fixing, like, is it really that-

20:09.700 --> 20:11.060
You're paying for his food, right?

20:11.060 --> 20:12.020
It's really not that-

20:12.020 --> 20:13.140
I mean, we're talking about like-

20:13.140 --> 20:13.940
A couple bucks a day.

20:15.060 --> 20:16.260
I mean, if that-

20:16.260 --> 20:18.660
No, I buy that premium shit though for my sweet pussy beer.

20:19.860 --> 20:22.340
Do you buy like wet food or dry food?

20:22.980 --> 20:23.700
I mix it up.

20:23.700 --> 20:26.740
I mix it because his constitution is weaker in the morning

20:26.740 --> 20:27.860
so he doesn't really have-

20:27.860 --> 20:30.340
He doesn't do saliva very well,

20:31.460 --> 20:33.460
so like I'll give it to him wet in the morning

20:33.460 --> 20:35.700
and then later in the day I'll let him have it dry.

20:35.700 --> 20:37.700
What, his saliva game is bad?

20:37.700 --> 20:39.300
This- He has dry mouth.

20:39.300 --> 20:40.180
He's a heavy drinker.

20:40.180 --> 20:41.060
I see.

20:41.060 --> 20:43.940
A good friend of mine from grad school just signed a 15th monthly-

20:43.940 --> 20:45.060
Guys, I have to talk.

20:45.060 --> 20:46.820
Can I talk to you guys for a second?

20:46.820 --> 20:48.580
From me to the listeners,

20:49.220 --> 20:52.340
you guys have got to start condensing these backstories.

20:52.340 --> 20:57.460
I can't keep reading these novellas every time that you want our help.

20:57.460 --> 20:59.380
Just get it down to brass tacks.

20:59.380 --> 21:01.860
And I want to tell you what, I edited both of these down.

21:02.420 --> 21:04.660
Listen, it's like when you leave this much,

21:04.660 --> 21:07.060
you're just leaving weaknesses we can exploit.

21:07.060 --> 21:10.580
We will do anything to keep from answering a question.

21:10.580 --> 21:13.700
So you have to leave us as little rope as possible

21:13.700 --> 21:14.980
or we will hang you with it.

21:15.620 --> 21:18.100
You have to put it to us concrete and direct.

21:19.060 --> 21:19.560
Here we go.

21:20.740 --> 21:22.180
A good friend of mine from grad school

21:22.180 --> 21:23.940
just signed a 15th month lease on a new apartment

21:23.940 --> 21:25.060
with his girlfriend of five years.

21:25.060 --> 21:29.540
They're about to get a cat, and on all appearances, they're very happy.

21:29.540 --> 21:30.340
Here's the problem.

21:30.340 --> 21:34.820
My friend's girlfriend, let's call him George, and let's call her Wanda.

21:34.820 --> 21:37.780
She, Wanda, told my girlfriend a secret.

21:38.340 --> 21:40.980
The secret is Wanda has cheated on George twice

21:40.980 --> 21:42.740
and she's tempted to do it again.

21:42.740 --> 21:44.580
But Wanda swore to my girlfriend a secrecy.

21:44.580 --> 21:46.500
Of course, my girlfriend told me,

21:46.500 --> 21:49.700
so now I know that Wanda is habitually unfaithful to George,

21:49.700 --> 21:52.260
and he's probably gearing up to propose to her the next week or two.

21:52.260 --> 21:53.780
If I tell him it'll ruin our friendship-

21:53.780 --> 21:54.280
Next week.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.140
Next year or two, not week.

21:56.140 --> 21:59.740
Next year or two, that's not gearing up to propose.

22:01.740 --> 22:04.940
I just gotta build my confidence for 18 months.

22:05.660 --> 22:09.660
If I tell him it'll ruin our friendship with Wanda because we ratted her out,

22:09.660 --> 22:13.100
and part of me thinks maybe they could work it out in the long run.

22:13.100 --> 22:16.780
Heck, for all I know, maybe George has cheated on Wanda too,

22:16.780 --> 22:18.780
although I have absolutely no evidence of that.

22:18.780 --> 22:22.860
Help me, brothers, should I tell George maybe in some anonymous way?

22:22.860 --> 22:25.180
If Wanda told my girlfriend, maybe she told others.

22:25.180 --> 22:26.460
I don't want to stir up shit.

22:26.460 --> 22:29.420
But what if they get a divorce years in the future when I could have prevented it?

22:29.420 --> 22:30.780
That's from Ify and Ithaca.

22:30.780 --> 22:33.020
This is a sexy little nut.

22:33.020 --> 22:35.580
This is like closer to the movie in question.

22:36.140 --> 22:37.180
Let me say this, though.

22:37.180 --> 22:39.900
You're worried about ruining your friendship with Wanda,

22:39.900 --> 22:42.540
which I think is naive because you should be worried

22:42.540 --> 22:44.700
about ruining your friendship with both of them.

22:45.580 --> 22:46.220
Yeah, you're gonna-

22:46.220 --> 22:48.300
I don't think anybody gets out of this one alive.

22:48.300 --> 22:48.620
Yeah.

22:48.620 --> 22:49.100
It's really-

22:49.100 --> 22:51.180
George isn't gonna go, hey, thanks, buddy.

22:51.180 --> 22:54.460
I- like, even though you helped him out, it's kill the messenger.

22:54.460 --> 22:59.020
Like, nobody likes the person that gives this kind of information.

22:59.020 --> 23:02.060
You gotta- you gotta pick- pick who's important to you.

23:02.060 --> 23:07.740
Who do you want- who do you want to take with you into the finale is the- is the question.

23:07.740 --> 23:10.700
Because if I were a- I don't know.

23:10.700 --> 23:13.580
If I were in your shoes, I think I'd probably go for Jorge.

23:13.580 --> 23:15.420
He seems like he's the one getting put-

23:15.420 --> 23:16.060
I know.

23:16.060 --> 23:18.220
Okay, listen, I gotta be serious with you.

23:18.220 --> 23:20.700
Everybody likes to have secrets, these little juicy-

23:20.700 --> 23:21.900
This is sexy for me to read this.

23:21.900 --> 23:25.820
Juicy tidbits, and everybody likes to have these secrets in their head.

23:26.380 --> 23:30.300
You cannot act on this.

23:30.300 --> 23:30.860
Nope.

23:30.860 --> 23:35.020
You cannot act on- here's the one move you have, okay?

23:35.020 --> 23:36.780
You have a single move.

23:38.220 --> 23:41.100
The single move is- nope, can't do that.

23:41.100 --> 23:44.860
I was gonna say you talk to Wanda about the cheating and tell her that she should tell George,

23:44.860 --> 23:49.180
but then Wanda knows that your friend told you that Wanda told your friend about the cheating,

23:49.180 --> 23:51.260
and then your friend told you about Wanda's secret.

23:51.260 --> 23:51.740
She'll fucking-

23:51.740 --> 23:52.860
So you can't do that.

23:52.860 --> 23:53.660
You don't have that move.

23:53.660 --> 23:56.540
She will riposte, she will turn that shit right back on you,

23:56.540 --> 23:59.820
she will fucking Cersei your ass, and you will be donezo.

23:59.820 --> 24:01.420
Your relationship will end.

24:01.420 --> 24:03.820
You'll find out that you've been cheated on.

24:03.820 --> 24:05.500
That's how she'll twist it on you.

24:05.500 --> 24:08.220
Because you're- you're dealing with a whoa man-eater.

24:08.220 --> 24:09.260
Watch out, here she comes.

24:09.820 --> 24:11.420
You can't do anything.

24:11.420 --> 24:14.940
I think the best advice is that you need to take like three steps back

24:14.940 --> 24:16.620
from your friendship with both of them.

24:17.420 --> 24:18.620
You know too much.

24:18.620 --> 24:19.580
Travis.

24:19.580 --> 24:23.100
But you're- but George is gonna need someone.

24:23.100 --> 24:23.820
When he realizes-

24:23.820 --> 24:24.540
But here's the problem-

24:24.540 --> 24:26.380
When these infidelities are- when they serve-

24:26.380 --> 24:27.580
Wait, does George look her?

24:27.580 --> 24:28.460
Is George sexy?

24:28.460 --> 24:29.660
Oh, good question.

24:29.660 --> 24:30.940
Oh, I like this.

24:30.940 --> 24:31.980
What about that?

24:31.980 --> 24:32.780
You twist that.

24:32.780 --> 24:35.500
Maybe turn it into a little opportunity for you.

24:36.540 --> 24:37.820
I don't- I don't understand.

24:37.820 --> 24:39.660
Do you mean help George get his sexy right?

24:40.300 --> 24:40.620
And then-

24:40.620 --> 24:45.180
Be like, George, you're- you're the patsy in this relationship.

24:45.180 --> 24:46.940
Come with- come be with me.

24:46.940 --> 24:48.140
Let me take care of you.

24:48.140 --> 24:48.860
But- right now.

24:48.860 --> 24:50.620
Let me- let me- let you love me.

24:50.620 --> 24:51.020
Let me love you.

24:51.020 --> 24:54.620
You're assuming a sexual attraction between George and our question asker.

24:54.620 --> 24:55.580
This is what I'm saying.

24:55.580 --> 24:56.540
You can't feel that right now?

24:56.540 --> 24:59.180
This is that closer shit that I'm talking about.

24:59.180 --> 25:01.820
This is gonna be so decadently sexy.

25:02.700 --> 25:06.700
But here's- here's where I think that you need- you need to get away safely.

25:06.700 --> 25:10.620
Because picture this, every time from now into eternity,

25:10.620 --> 25:14.540
when the four of you or even just like you and George and Wanda go out to a bar

25:14.540 --> 25:17.980
and you see Wanda talking to any other guy ever,

25:19.260 --> 25:21.820
you're gonna just get the strongest douche.

25:21.820 --> 25:23.100
Your stomach's gonna clench up.

25:23.100 --> 25:24.620
Just butt out though, then.

25:24.620 --> 25:25.100
If you don't-

25:25.100 --> 25:25.820
That's what I'm saying.

25:25.820 --> 25:26.460
So back out.

25:26.460 --> 25:27.500
You know too much.

25:27.500 --> 25:30.700
I mean, you can still hang out with them, but when you observe shit like that,

25:30.700 --> 25:31.820
just maybe George knows.

25:31.820 --> 25:34.060
Maybe it's a part- maybe they got an open thing.

25:34.060 --> 25:35.580
A secret open relationship.

25:37.260 --> 25:38.060
It's none of your bi-

25:38.060 --> 25:39.100
It's not sexier.

25:39.100 --> 25:43.660
This is the- first off, let me thank you guys for bringing us into this sexual web.

25:43.660 --> 25:44.220
Fuck.

25:44.220 --> 25:46.540
I- it's either- it's one of two things.

25:46.540 --> 25:51.900
It's either incredibly crushingly sad or just real sexy,

25:51.900 --> 25:56.300
and I'm gonna pretend it's the latter because I need some jail material.

25:58.860 --> 25:59.980
There's not a move here.

25:59.980 --> 26:01.420
I mean, you don't have a move.

26:01.420 --> 26:02.140
You don't.

26:02.140 --> 26:05.660
I thought about that one move about talking to Wanda, but you can't do that.

26:05.660 --> 26:08.940
I mean, the- and here's the thing about it is that like-

26:08.940 --> 26:12.540
You're going to have to actively work to convince yourself that it's none of your business.

26:13.260 --> 26:16.940
It's like a decision you're going to have to make and stick to actively.

26:16.940 --> 26:18.700
You're not actually helping anybody.

26:18.700 --> 26:20.300
I mean, that's the thing, right?

26:20.300 --> 26:27.740
Like, if George knows he's been getting cuckolded, then that- that makes him feel bad about himself.

26:28.380 --> 26:32.220
You don't actually win anything by George knowing the truth.

26:32.220 --> 26:35.740
I mean, sure, maybe he can get himself out of the relationship, but maybe

26:35.740 --> 26:39.820
she still really loves George. I mean, maybe they're a great fit.

26:39.820 --> 26:47.100
And like, you are making the decision that that infidelity is the most important thing

26:47.100 --> 26:48.380
about that relationship.

26:48.380 --> 26:51.340
And I don't think that that, you know, like, I don't- I don't know.

26:51.340 --> 26:55.420
Maybe there's other things that are more important to George, but you are making the decision to

26:55.420 --> 27:01.260
introduce a distrust in this relationship that may not be there right now and

27:01.260 --> 27:08.060
very possibly will never be removed. I really don't think it's- it's- it's your pl- besides

27:08.060 --> 27:13.900
the obvious, like, self-preservation instinct, I just don't think it's your place to step in here.

27:13.900 --> 27:17.020
Let me- let me give you the suggestion of something you can do.

27:17.020 --> 27:21.660
It's innocuous, but effective, and that is to leave a note on their front door that just says,

27:21.660 --> 27:22.160
I know.

27:24.940 --> 27:27.500
That is actually a move I'd recommend to anybody.

27:27.500 --> 27:32.780
That is actually a move I'd recommend to anybody in almost any scenario.

27:32.780 --> 27:35.500
Because it's- it's not going to put you on blast.

27:36.220 --> 27:40.060
If he- if George- if George sees it, he'll be like, oh, weird.

27:40.060 --> 27:41.740
And if Wanda sees it, she'll be like-

27:42.780 --> 27:46.780
Or George will feel guilty for everything he's ever done ever.

27:46.780 --> 27:50.300
No, I'm sorry. If George finds it much like any man finding it,

27:50.300 --> 27:53.180
he will assume someone has found that folder in his computer.

27:53.180 --> 27:59.740
God damn it, I thought I had it- I had it hidden in a deep, deep, archived note or whatever.

27:59.740 --> 28:00.860
Let's stop talking about this-

28:00.860 --> 28:03.100
But I titled it, Please Do Not Look.

28:03.100 --> 28:06.860
Let's stop talking about this question, because it's starting to go to a sad place,

28:06.860 --> 28:08.620
and instead talk about our new business.

28:09.180 --> 28:13.180
Where we go to people's houses and leave notes on their front door that say, I know.

28:13.180 --> 28:15.580
Because that's a fucking life-changing experience.

28:15.580 --> 28:17.100
That's like- that's like The Game.

28:17.660 --> 28:20.220
It's like that movie, The Game, because, like, you got some shit.

28:20.220 --> 28:23.580
Even if you're, like, a good upstanding citizen, you got some shit

28:23.580 --> 28:26.380
that you need to come face to face with, you need to come to terms with.

28:26.380 --> 28:30.940
And you can either go to, you know, 10 therapy sessions,

28:30.940 --> 28:34.460
or you can get a note on your front door that says, I know, and just all of a sudden be-

28:35.020 --> 28:39.340
Come face to face with the fact that your kingdom is about to come toppling down on top of you.

28:39.340 --> 28:43.340
Then make it actionable and put, like, I know, and you have three months.

28:44.060 --> 28:48.380
Well, that seems- I wouldn't make it more threatening than I know.

28:48.380 --> 28:51.660
But what it says is, it's like, hey, you have three months to turn it all around.

28:51.660 --> 28:56.380
Or it says, in three months, you're going to die because I put a voodoo curse on you.

28:56.940 --> 28:58.540
That's not what I know means.

28:58.540 --> 29:00.300
And I mean, I know I put a voodoo curse on you.

29:00.300 --> 29:02.300
And then on the back, it says, thinner.

29:02.300 --> 29:05.580
And then under that, it says, like, the movie and book, Thinner, by Stephen King.

29:07.420 --> 29:09.900
And thinner is printed there, the whole book.

29:09.900 --> 29:14.540
And yeah, I'm sorry, the note is left as a bookmark in a copy of the book, Thinner.

29:14.540 --> 29:18.460
What if we did a remake of Closer, and it was called Closer and Thinner?

29:18.460 --> 29:22.780
And it was just the four people, and they were just fucking each other like they were

29:22.780 --> 29:25.420
caught in a fucking sexy food processor.

29:26.220 --> 29:29.660
And also, they were just perpetually getting skinnier until dead.

29:30.300 --> 29:31.180
I'd watch it.

29:31.180 --> 29:31.900
I would watch it, too.

29:31.900 --> 29:32.860
I would watch that, though.

29:32.860 --> 29:34.940
Poor Natalie Portman would not last very long.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.780
Not that I'm saying Julia Roberts is fat.

29:37.340 --> 29:39.580
I'm just cutting off the emails right here.

29:39.580 --> 29:41.180
We're not interested in them, guys.

29:41.180 --> 29:44.620
We don't care who you think is thinner, between Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts.

29:44.620 --> 29:45.820
Clearly Natalie Portman, no.

29:45.820 --> 29:46.780
Want to go to the Money Town?

29:46.780 --> 29:47.420
Yeah, absolutely.

29:57.980 --> 29:59.340
Griffin, who's first on the docket?

30:00.460 --> 30:08.140
First on the docket, first in the catalog, is a website called hugepop.com, who asks

30:08.140 --> 30:11.980
our listeners to visit hugepop.com, where you'll-

30:11.980 --> 30:14.860
Not hugepoop.com, which is what I first typed in.

30:15.500 --> 30:16.940
Why would you do that, though?

30:16.940 --> 30:18.220
It was an accident.

30:18.220 --> 30:19.660
It wasn't an accident.

30:19.660 --> 30:24.220
At hugepop.com, you'll find strange, funny, and unsettling stories written and read to

30:24.220 --> 30:25.740
you by me, Adam Drent.

30:26.380 --> 30:30.220
You can read them, stream them, or download them and listen to them on your mobile device.

30:30.220 --> 30:35.180
There is also a series of comedy audio sketches called One Man's World, and you can download

30:35.180 --> 30:39.740
or stream three hip-hop albums by the mispronouncer, who is also me, Adam Drent.

30:39.740 --> 30:40.700
Everything is free.

30:41.580 --> 30:42.300
That's all you need.

30:42.300 --> 30:42.380
I like that.

30:42.380 --> 30:43.980
You should have led with that last thing.

30:45.100 --> 30:46.460
Yeah, everything is free.

30:46.460 --> 30:48.140
Now, give me a moment of your time.

30:49.260 --> 30:53.740
You could be going there right now to Huge Pop and getting something funny while you're

30:53.740 --> 30:55.260
listening to our show.

30:55.260 --> 30:58.300
You could be reading something, too, and just really expanding your horizons.

30:58.300 --> 31:01.740
I've been thinking about getting into listening to hip-hop, because I saw Kanye West perform

31:01.740 --> 31:04.940
yesterday on SNL, and it wasn't in any way terrifying.

31:04.940 --> 31:07.500
That's how I feel about that Macklemore character.

31:08.060 --> 31:08.940
He seems nice.

31:08.940 --> 31:15.020
Kanye West's performance on SNL last night compared to Macklemore makes Macklemore seem

31:15.020 --> 31:16.700
like my sweet little pussy bear.

31:18.460 --> 31:24.860
Kanye West last night, he is the angriest of all the people who are in the 1%.

31:24.860 --> 31:26.780
I think he is angriest at the 1%.

31:26.780 --> 31:30.460
I worry that there is some self-loathing there, some heavy self-loathing.

31:30.460 --> 31:33.740
I like that hook, though, on New Slaves.

31:35.740 --> 31:36.220
Woof.

31:36.220 --> 31:42.700
Man, that's a sentence that like 200 years ago would have meant some pretty bogus shit.

31:42.700 --> 31:49.020
If you would like to be handcuffed, though, boy, do we have a great option for you.

31:49.980 --> 31:51.420
It's ExtremeRestraints.com.

31:52.620 --> 31:53.500
Just tell me about it.

31:54.060 --> 31:56.860
Come on, I'm on pins and needles.

31:56.860 --> 31:58.540
Oh, you want ExtremeRestraints.

31:58.540 --> 31:59.340
Yeah, thank you.

31:59.340 --> 32:00.060
There it is.

32:00.060 --> 32:00.940
Okay, great.

32:00.940 --> 32:04.460
ExtremeRestraints.com is an adult superstore.

32:04.460 --> 32:07.740
I'm at the edge of my seat, and also there's a dildo glued to it.

32:10.460 --> 32:12.220
They would probably weld it.

32:12.220 --> 32:13.900
It's all high quality stuff.

32:13.900 --> 32:15.500
That's gonna fit OSHA standards.

32:15.500 --> 32:18.060
Yeah, you don't want that dildo coming off inside your butt.

32:18.060 --> 32:18.780
Or do you?

32:18.780 --> 32:19.340
You do.

32:20.940 --> 32:21.660
You did.

32:22.380 --> 32:23.340
Oh, you did.

32:24.460 --> 32:29.580
Guys, if you have not been to ExtremeRestraints.com,

32:29.580 --> 32:32.540
I have something awesome for you.

32:32.540 --> 32:35.980
There is a first time buyer special right now

32:35.980 --> 32:39.900
where you can get a ton of sex toys for 99 cents or $2.

32:42.300 --> 32:48.060
A small mini massager, some anal pleasure beads, Thai anal beads they are,

32:48.860 --> 32:49.820
bondage tape.

32:50.860 --> 32:52.300
No, I know what you're asking yourself.

32:52.300 --> 32:58.460
Can I just use marbles and can I use scotch tape and can I just use a regular massager

32:58.460 --> 33:00.380
to replace these three things?

33:01.340 --> 33:06.220
I'm not sure that I want to go the extreme bargain route

33:06.220 --> 33:08.460
with something I'm gonna put into my pussy.

33:08.460 --> 33:09.020
Yeah.

33:09.020 --> 33:14.620
But I do think that these are a great introduction to sexual play.

33:14.620 --> 33:16.780
Have you guys ever seen that show Sexy MacGyver?

33:17.340 --> 33:19.420
Don't try to make your sex toys at home.

33:19.420 --> 33:20.780
Don't be like Griffin.

33:21.820 --> 33:23.420
I'm a professional though.

33:24.700 --> 33:28.220
I've been sweeting my own sex toys for a long time now.

33:28.220 --> 33:30.540
Once you do 10,000 hours, you're an expert.

33:30.540 --> 33:31.340
Exactly.

33:31.340 --> 33:35.260
And once you shove 10,000 marbles in your butt, then you're dead.

33:35.260 --> 33:35.820
You died.

33:35.820 --> 33:36.460
He went for it.

33:36.460 --> 33:37.740
He went for the record.

33:37.740 --> 33:38.300
I did.

33:38.300 --> 33:40.060
I shot for the stars.

33:40.060 --> 33:43.340
You know that scene in Nick of Time where John Malkovich

33:43.340 --> 33:46.540
puts together a gun out of plastic stuff that he smuggled in

33:47.580 --> 33:51.100
and how I might be misremembering both leading characters

33:51.100 --> 33:52.940
and plot points of Nick of Time?

33:53.660 --> 33:54.540
Extremely strange.

33:54.540 --> 33:55.740
Griffin's like that with sex toys.

33:55.740 --> 33:58.140
Yeah, I make little guns and I shoot them up my butt.

33:59.820 --> 34:00.780
It's the ultimate pleasure.

34:01.580 --> 34:04.060
You don't have to do that though because the savings are very real.

34:04.060 --> 34:05.100
With the coupon code...

34:06.060 --> 34:09.820
If I shot a pistol up my butthole, do you think I could...

34:09.820 --> 34:10.380
What's the coupon code?

34:10.380 --> 34:11.660
Do you think I could survive?

34:11.660 --> 34:12.060
Let's talk about something else.

34:12.060 --> 34:14.540
You'd have to stand very straight and open your mouth really wide.

34:14.540 --> 34:15.260
This is important.

34:15.260 --> 34:16.620
Yeah, would I live through that?

34:17.180 --> 34:17.680
Yeah.

34:18.540 --> 34:19.820
The bullets would come out of your mouth.

34:19.820 --> 34:20.860
I don't think I would.

34:20.860 --> 34:22.380
I don't think I'd come out of that one okay.

34:23.660 --> 34:24.860
I don't think so.

34:24.860 --> 34:25.660
Let's not find out.

34:25.660 --> 34:29.180
Let's instead go to ExtremeShades.com and use the coupon code...

34:29.180 --> 34:30.220
Swordfish.

34:30.220 --> 34:30.860
Swordfish.

34:30.860 --> 34:31.500
It's unbelievable.

34:31.500 --> 34:33.020
And you're gonna save 20% though.

34:34.220 --> 34:36.780
So please don't hack that or anything

34:36.780 --> 34:38.620
because that seems to be a problem for people.

34:38.620 --> 34:39.660
They can't help themselves.

34:39.660 --> 34:40.460
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

34:41.580 --> 34:42.080
Please.

34:42.620 --> 34:44.780
It's the only other one I have so let's make it count.

34:45.900 --> 34:47.020
It's sent in by Emily Wall.

34:47.020 --> 34:47.500
Thanks Emily.

34:47.500 --> 34:51.100
It's by Yahoo Answers user Lunar Cure who asks...

34:51.100 --> 34:53.900
Farmers have seen some awesome secrets of nature.

34:53.900 --> 34:55.180
Tell us some, please.

34:58.220 --> 35:01.660
Like sunflowers, bee dances, etc.

35:03.180 --> 35:04.700
I'm sorry, what was that second one?

35:04.700 --> 35:05.660
Bee dances.

35:11.660 --> 35:16.620
Somewhere a farmer just smiles knowingly and slowly shakes his head.

35:17.420 --> 35:18.940
These secrets go to my grave.

35:18.940 --> 35:21.820
These secrets go to my grave, kids.

35:23.180 --> 35:29.100
I went to a murder mystery a few weeks ago at a castle in Ohio.

35:29.100 --> 35:29.980
True story.

35:29.980 --> 35:31.660
Not a goof setup.

35:31.660 --> 35:32.540
Not a goof yet.

35:32.540 --> 35:33.420
We're not at the goof.

35:33.420 --> 35:34.380
There is no goof here.

35:34.380 --> 35:35.660
There's just truth.

35:35.660 --> 35:41.100
And while I was there, there was a man dressed up like some sort of battle monk

35:41.100 --> 35:43.340
and he had a wife who was a nun

35:43.340 --> 35:51.260
and they performed for us a dance that they learned from the owls behind their house

35:51.820 --> 35:54.220
to the tune of Thriller.

35:55.820 --> 35:57.420
I have a video on my phone.

35:57.420 --> 36:00.140
If you ever catch me in real life, you say,

36:00.140 --> 36:04.940
Justin, I gotta see that owl dance and I will hook you up.

36:04.940 --> 36:05.440
Why?

36:06.300 --> 36:08.540
Where the owl's like, all right, from the top.

36:09.580 --> 36:10.220
I don't want to see...

36:10.220 --> 36:11.660
You've been working on this for a while.

36:11.660 --> 36:13.500
I want to see some snap.

36:13.500 --> 36:14.460
Don't make it lazy.

36:14.460 --> 36:15.500
One, two, three, four.

36:17.740 --> 36:18.460
Jazz feathers.

36:20.380 --> 36:21.420
Bee dances are apparently a real...

36:21.420 --> 36:22.380
They don't have hands.

36:22.380 --> 36:22.620
Sure.

36:22.620 --> 36:23.260
Thank you, Travis.

36:23.260 --> 36:24.940
I think bee dances are a real thing.

36:24.940 --> 36:30.140
It's called a waggle dance, which describes literally every dance I'm also capable of doing.

36:33.820 --> 36:37.980
Yahoo answer once responded, flowers are plant genitalia.

36:37.980 --> 36:44.060
Uh, secret exposed, secret revealed.

36:45.020 --> 36:46.460
Farmers probably know some shit though.

36:46.460 --> 36:48.700
They probably know some fucking earth wisdom.

36:48.700 --> 36:51.260
They're probably, well, not these days.

36:51.260 --> 36:58.060
These days, farmers just flip the switch on the machine that yanks the milk out of the cow's tits.

36:58.060 --> 37:02.540
Do you think, do you think that farmers still know how high the sycamore grows?

37:03.180 --> 37:04.140
I don't think, no.

37:05.420 --> 37:06.620
No, I think the only...

37:06.620 --> 37:08.380
Why does the grinning bobcat grin?

37:08.380 --> 37:10.620
They don't care about why the bad bobcat grins.

37:10.620 --> 37:12.060
They just want to shower him in chemicals.

37:12.060 --> 37:12.780
You know, I think...

37:12.780 --> 37:14.460
Can we paint it with all the colors of the mountain?

37:15.100 --> 37:17.980
Listen, Douglas, I think your farm is great.

37:17.980 --> 37:21.980
I do think that if you did not have that giant sycamore in the middle of it,

37:21.980 --> 37:23.420
just to see how tall it'll grow.

37:24.060 --> 37:25.340
What if I cut it down?

37:25.340 --> 37:26.140
I'll never know.

37:27.660 --> 37:29.260
You won't live to see it.

37:29.260 --> 37:30.220
No one will.

37:30.220 --> 37:32.140
My children's children will.

37:32.140 --> 37:34.940
Their children's children are going to turn it into magazines.

37:34.940 --> 37:36.780
Man, that bobcat sure seems to like it though.

37:37.660 --> 37:39.740
That bobcat seems pleased his punch.

37:39.740 --> 37:40.700
How did he do that?

37:40.700 --> 37:41.420
I don't know.

37:41.420 --> 37:42.220
He's just that way.

37:42.860 --> 37:43.740
That's just how he is.

37:44.700 --> 37:45.500
Call him Henry.

37:47.740 --> 37:48.940
Everything is shale colored.

37:48.940 --> 37:50.940
Yeah, dog, it's mountain colors, idiot.

37:52.540 --> 37:53.740
Paint it with the color of the mountain.

37:53.740 --> 37:54.380
That's what I do.

37:55.660 --> 38:01.340
Apparently, sunflowers fucking rotate to follow the sun across the sky.

38:03.180 --> 38:03.420
Yeah.

38:03.420 --> 38:04.780
It's called heliotropism.

38:04.780 --> 38:05.500
Didn't know this.

38:05.500 --> 38:08.220
I just learned about heliotropism from Yahoo Answers.

38:08.220 --> 38:08.780
Is it real?

38:09.500 --> 38:12.860
I don't want you to learn from Yahoo Answers ever.

38:12.860 --> 38:14.060
This is the singularity.

38:14.060 --> 38:14.540
Everybody out.

38:14.540 --> 38:16.540
I don't want to learn anything from Yahoo Answers either,

38:16.540 --> 38:18.380
but if it happens, then I'm willing to accept it

38:18.380 --> 38:20.460
because I love knowledge and I love drinking it up.

38:20.460 --> 38:22.620
And apparently, heliotropism is the thing.

38:22.620 --> 38:25.820
Apparently, Wikipedia is telling me all about waggle dances now.

38:25.820 --> 38:28.300
I'm going down a fucking rabbit hole right now.

38:28.300 --> 38:30.700
Griffin to knowledge is like a sunflower to the sun.

38:30.700 --> 38:34.300
Griffin just tilts his genitalia.

38:34.300 --> 38:36.300
I tilt my plant genitalia towards it.

38:38.460 --> 38:40.620
One of the Yahoo Answers responded, carrots.

38:43.180 --> 38:44.140
Indeed.

38:44.140 --> 38:44.860
Revealed.

38:45.900 --> 38:47.580
I bet you guys, cows know.

38:47.580 --> 38:50.220
I bet you cows also know some shit,

38:50.220 --> 38:55.420
but mostly farmers know some shit about earth and the way things work

38:56.380 --> 38:57.580
that they're not telling us.

38:58.860 --> 39:00.780
About good dirt and bad dirt.

39:00.780 --> 39:02.780
I bet that's something they know a lot about.

39:02.780 --> 39:04.780
You know what's funny is they know a lot about farming,

39:04.780 --> 39:07.980
but they've never seen like a tall building or like a car.

39:07.980 --> 39:08.700
Yeah, right.

39:08.700 --> 39:10.220
They would be horrified.

39:10.220 --> 39:11.500
It would be very scary.

39:11.500 --> 39:15.420
But I bet they know all about what happened in Benghazi.

39:16.860 --> 39:18.380
I bet they know the truth about Benghazi.

39:18.380 --> 39:22.140
If you want to fucking suss that out, put a farmer on the stand.

39:22.140 --> 39:23.900
There's two things farmers know about.

39:24.540 --> 39:27.260
Like agricultural shit and foreign affairs.

39:27.260 --> 39:28.620
And Benghazi specifically.

39:28.620 --> 39:33.340
I've been trying to get into gardening.

39:33.340 --> 39:35.980
Sydney and I have been trying to plan some stuff.

39:35.980 --> 39:38.940
And speaking of secrets that farmers know,

39:39.500 --> 39:43.340
one of those secrets that I don't know that I'm betting farmers do

39:43.340 --> 39:48.780
is basically not knowing what plants will emerge from the ground

39:48.780 --> 39:51.260
and which I will have to retrieve from there.

39:51.260 --> 39:54.460
I literally had to ask Sydney about basically every plant.

39:54.460 --> 40:00.300
Like will the pepper be in the ground or will it be above the ground?

40:00.300 --> 40:03.340
And I bet that's a secret that farmers have on a lot pretty much.

40:03.340 --> 40:07.820
Yeah, I bet that that's pretty important to just their general survival

40:07.820 --> 40:13.500
and their fiscal stability is just knowing sort of like where the carrots are at any given time.

40:13.500 --> 40:14.940
I can never remember.

40:14.940 --> 40:16.540
Ah shit, I did it wrong again.

40:16.540 --> 40:17.340
I dug up.

40:17.340 --> 40:19.660
Is it a carrot tree?

40:19.660 --> 40:20.380
Fuck.

40:20.380 --> 40:21.260
I can't remember.

40:21.260 --> 40:22.300
I did it bad.

40:22.300 --> 40:23.820
I'm the worst farmer.

40:23.820 --> 40:27.420
I don't know any of the secrets of Mother Earth's beautiful womb

40:28.220 --> 40:30.300
that I grow my carrot children inside.

40:30.300 --> 40:32.300
I should never cut down that signal.

40:32.300 --> 40:36.060
One of my neighbor farmers told me that if you feed a cow rocks,

40:36.620 --> 40:41.900
then he'll poop out whole watermelons that you can sell at the country fair.

40:42.700 --> 40:44.380
But they just killed them.

40:44.380 --> 40:44.940
They died.

40:45.580 --> 40:46.540
They're tricky farmers.

40:46.540 --> 40:48.140
That's the secret about farm wisdom.

40:49.500 --> 40:52.780
They're either telling you something that will enrich your life,

40:52.780 --> 40:57.660
like heliotropism and bee dances, or they'll give you a little riddle.

40:59.500 --> 41:00.460
They'll play a trick on you.

41:00.460 --> 41:01.820
They're like bridge trolls.

41:01.820 --> 41:03.660
They're actually descended from bridge trolls.

41:03.660 --> 41:04.220
They are.

41:04.220 --> 41:06.060
All farmers are descended from bridge trolls.

41:06.060 --> 41:07.100
They only speak in riddles.

41:07.980 --> 41:09.180
There's another secret for you.

41:10.140 --> 41:12.220
You know that poem God Made a Farmer?

41:13.420 --> 41:14.380
It's not true.

41:14.380 --> 41:15.260
God made a bridge troll.

41:15.900 --> 41:19.500
And then they just sort of naturally fell into another vacation.

41:19.500 --> 41:23.100
They defied his teachings and they left the bridges.

41:23.100 --> 41:24.700
And so they were cast out of Eden.

41:25.820 --> 41:27.260
That's Genesis 1-1, baby.

41:28.060 --> 41:28.540
Read a book.

41:28.540 --> 41:29.420
Read a book.

41:29.420 --> 41:31.100
Specifically the Bible.

41:31.100 --> 41:33.180
Specifically our new version of the Bible.

41:34.540 --> 41:36.460
The Bradley's Grimm presents the Bible.

41:37.900 --> 41:41.180
I want to ask a real question and help someone to undo the damage.

41:41.180 --> 41:43.100
If you know farm wisdom, will you email-

41:43.100 --> 41:44.700
If you live on a farm, first of all,

41:44.700 --> 41:47.260
that's dope that you're listening to a podcast on a farm.

41:47.260 --> 41:49.660
Second of all, email us some farm wisdom

41:49.660 --> 41:52.380
because I'm genuinely interested in farm wisdom now.

41:52.380 --> 41:53.100
And a picture.

41:53.100 --> 41:54.620
Can I have a picture of a cow, please?

41:55.340 --> 41:56.700
Send us a telegram or something.

41:56.700 --> 41:57.500
I mean, they're farmers.

41:57.500 --> 41:58.460
They don't have internet.

41:58.460 --> 42:02.220
They're getting this podcast delivered on a jump drive.

42:02.220 --> 42:05.260
The milkman swings by every day.

42:05.260 --> 42:08.380
I'm not sure why they would need a milkman because they live on a farm.

42:08.380 --> 42:09.260
He's picking up.

42:09.260 --> 42:10.060
He's picking up.

42:10.060 --> 42:11.340
Oh, I see what I see.

42:11.340 --> 42:11.820
I get you.

42:12.700 --> 42:13.660
I see what I did.

42:13.660 --> 42:15.100
They got to get it from somewhere, I guess.

42:15.100 --> 42:16.940
Yeah, cow tits.

42:18.620 --> 42:23.340
Recently, during the exam period at university, I grew an exam beard.

42:23.340 --> 42:27.900
Recently, though, I noticed it's been drawing some nice attention from a few girls.

42:27.900 --> 42:29.500
So it seems to be working for me.

42:30.700 --> 42:35.180
This would be a problem if not for the fact that it's itchy as all fucking hell.

42:35.820 --> 42:39.980
So do I keep the beard as well as the attention, which has been quite nice,

42:40.780 --> 42:43.820
and suffer the discomfort or do I get rid of it?

42:43.820 --> 42:46.540
That's from Beard and Loathing in St. Andrews.

42:46.540 --> 42:53.260
Well, I think at least one of us on this call is qualified to answer this question.

42:53.260 --> 42:55.980
Okay, I'm going to rock everyone's world for a minute.

42:55.980 --> 43:00.780
Before we do that, though, can we talk about is an exam beard?

43:01.740 --> 43:06.700
Is that just like when people like do a thing and so they feel like they have to have some

43:06.700 --> 43:07.980
sort of physical changes?

43:07.980 --> 43:09.660
No, I totally get it.

43:09.660 --> 43:12.620
I totally get it because it happens to me too when I'm installing a show.

43:12.620 --> 43:19.100
And it's like you just get so caught up in the old rat race that you stop taking care

43:19.100 --> 43:19.980
of your physical self.

43:19.980 --> 43:23.100
It's not like he's squirreled away at TI-83 in there, right?

43:23.100 --> 43:25.660
It's not like it's not for cheating.

43:25.660 --> 43:26.940
He doesn't keep notes in there.

43:26.940 --> 43:28.700
Secret notes inside of his...

43:28.700 --> 43:30.540
I whisper the answers into my beard.

43:31.340 --> 43:32.220
I shake them out.

43:32.220 --> 43:33.900
It echoes endlessly.

43:35.740 --> 43:39.500
No, I think exam beard just means that he stopped like bathing and stuff for like...

43:39.500 --> 43:40.220
He gave it up.

43:40.220 --> 43:43.740
I bet he's got a pretty crazy exam bush too.

43:45.820 --> 43:49.340
My exam fingernails have gotten a lot of attention from the ladies.

43:50.940 --> 43:54.380
Travis, tell me, what's it like to have a beard?

43:54.380 --> 43:55.820
It's pretty great, Justin.

43:57.660 --> 43:59.900
People often touch it for no reason.

44:02.540 --> 44:04.780
And the ladies do love it.

44:04.780 --> 44:07.100
We're in an era where it's coming right on back.

44:07.100 --> 44:09.180
It's very manly and the people like it.

44:09.180 --> 44:12.860
And let me tell you how to keep it from being itchy is I'll fucking get out.

44:12.860 --> 44:15.020
Wildman Beard Conditioning Oil.

44:16.060 --> 44:17.180
Wildman is the brand.

44:17.180 --> 44:17.980
Okay.

44:17.980 --> 44:19.340
But there have to be other...

44:20.140 --> 44:20.860
I know you're probably...

44:20.860 --> 44:22.860
You can do normal conditioner.

44:23.660 --> 44:24.620
There's beard wash.

44:24.620 --> 44:27.580
Grow it out real long so it gets soft and then trim it back.

44:27.580 --> 44:28.080
Honey.

44:29.340 --> 44:29.840
Pure...

44:29.840 --> 44:30.380
Yes, sweetie?

44:30.380 --> 44:30.880
Pure...

44:30.880 --> 44:32.220
No, I'm saying pure honey.

44:32.220 --> 44:32.720
Okay.

44:33.580 --> 44:36.620
Massage a little bit of honey into your beard and it's great.

44:36.620 --> 44:38.220
You could do a beer wash.

44:38.220 --> 44:40.540
It's going to be sticky and you're going to hate it.

44:40.540 --> 44:41.900
But you know who's not going to hate it?

44:42.540 --> 44:43.340
Bees.

44:43.340 --> 44:44.380
Bees are going to love it.

44:45.420 --> 44:49.260
I've got an exam beard of bees that's gotten a lot of attention from the ladies.

44:49.260 --> 44:49.980
If you want to make a...

44:49.980 --> 44:50.940
I like your beard.

44:50.940 --> 44:52.140
I like the gnats in it.

44:52.140 --> 44:55.500
If you really want to watch a bee dance.

44:55.500 --> 44:57.580
If you really want to see a bee fucking twerk it,

44:58.300 --> 45:02.300
rub a little honey in that beard of yours and they will get so hyphy so quick.

45:02.300 --> 45:07.340
They'll just shake in front of you like, let me up into your beard.

45:08.220 --> 45:09.660
Why are you grinding on me?

45:09.660 --> 45:13.180
Luckily, I got this protected beard to protect me from your stinger.

45:13.980 --> 45:15.100
Protecting us both.

45:15.100 --> 45:17.100
So if that comes out, you're done.

45:19.900 --> 45:22.700
What if you saw someone with a giant beard in the middle of the exam,

45:22.700 --> 45:25.660
just stand up and throw their arms in the sky and just say,

45:25.660 --> 45:26.540
Bees!

45:27.820 --> 45:29.340
And the exam's over.

45:29.340 --> 45:31.420
Because bees just fly out of his beard.

45:31.420 --> 45:35.740
That's actually in the college law where everyone then gets a bee.

45:39.340 --> 45:40.620
That's your best option.

45:44.140 --> 45:45.900
And it's too hard for you.

45:45.900 --> 45:47.900
You say, well, I got to get out of this one.

45:47.900 --> 45:49.340
Bees!

45:49.340 --> 45:50.220
Bees!

45:52.220 --> 45:52.780
Oh, man.

45:52.780 --> 45:57.740
And then the professor just slowly puts down the pen he's been writing his dissertation with

45:57.740 --> 45:59.980
and walks out of the room and gives everybody a bee.

45:59.980 --> 46:01.580
And everybody gets a bee.

46:01.580 --> 46:03.500
Man, this is a pretty cool college, this guy goes.

46:03.500 --> 46:06.540
And then everyone turns and thanks you because they didn't have the courage to do it.

46:07.740 --> 46:10.540
They couldn't grow an exam beard to lodge bees in.

46:11.500 --> 46:12.220
That's how we got-

46:12.220 --> 46:12.700
That's the thing.

46:12.700 --> 46:13.820
You can't just say bees.

46:13.820 --> 46:15.180
You got to go like the full mile.

46:15.740 --> 46:16.780
That's farmer wisdom.

46:16.780 --> 46:17.420
I learned that from a farmer.

46:17.420 --> 46:18.220
That's what I'm saying.

46:18.220 --> 46:22.700
This is applicable, potent farm wisdom that I could be using in my everyday life.

46:23.340 --> 46:25.180
How do we know so much farm wisdom?

46:25.180 --> 46:26.780
We're from West Virginia.

46:26.780 --> 46:30.300
We got it by Appalachian Osmosis.

46:30.300 --> 46:35.900
Well, see that actually the original rule comes from whenever a farmer had to pay the

46:35.900 --> 46:37.820
bank to keep their land.

46:37.820 --> 46:41.260
If they grew a beard and yelled bees, the bank had to back off.

46:41.260 --> 46:46.140
Do bees actually come in in this scenario or is it just like the threat of bees is so-

46:46.140 --> 46:48.780
It's kind of like when you call like I have the power, you know?

46:48.780 --> 46:52.060
It's like that kind of thing where you're just summoning the courage of the bee.

46:52.060 --> 46:52.860
When I see a man with a big-

46:52.860 --> 46:55.020
The problem is you never know.

46:55.020 --> 46:55.420
Right.

46:55.420 --> 46:59.900
You look at someone and he says bees or maybe he just whispers and points at the beard.

46:59.900 --> 47:00.380
Bees.

47:01.740 --> 47:03.100
Are you going to call this bluff?

47:03.100 --> 47:10.300
Are there bees in the beard or are we to believe because of his crazy facial hair that he possesses

47:10.300 --> 47:11.660
bee channeling abilities?

47:12.620 --> 47:13.980
Little column A, little column B.

47:15.020 --> 47:17.660
It's all about the mystique and it's about really committing to the bit.

47:17.660 --> 47:18.380
That's the thing.

47:19.500 --> 47:22.060
Maybe just one bee pops out and says, I know others.

47:22.060 --> 47:29.660
And then you should actually, if you're going to sell this, I think you cannot appear in

47:29.660 --> 47:33.340
class for weeks before because it has to-

47:33.340 --> 47:34.940
They have to think you're dead.

47:34.940 --> 47:39.260
You have to fake your own death and come back with a bee that can emit bees.

47:39.260 --> 47:41.980
Or sorry, a bee that has a beard.

47:41.980 --> 47:42.480
Wait.

47:43.340 --> 47:44.220
Hey guys, what's up?

47:46.620 --> 47:47.740
Just tried something new.

47:48.780 --> 47:50.140
That's Paul and Greg.

47:50.140 --> 47:51.180
You're not fooling us.

47:51.180 --> 47:53.500
I know it's a little spotty in some places, but I'm a fucking bee.

47:54.060 --> 47:54.620
What are you going to do?

47:54.620 --> 47:55.260
It'll fill out.

47:55.260 --> 47:55.820
It'll fill out.

47:55.820 --> 47:56.540
Just keep growing.

47:57.340 --> 47:58.460
Are we getting that statement?

48:01.420 --> 48:03.100
Travis, are you going to shave your beard for your wedding?

48:03.820 --> 48:05.740
No, my fiance would kill me.

48:05.740 --> 48:06.780
I guess that's true.

48:06.780 --> 48:09.660
The only reason I have the beard is because Teresa insists.

48:09.660 --> 48:11.900
And the only reason he has a fiance is because he has a beard.

48:11.900 --> 48:12.460
That's true.

48:12.460 --> 48:14.780
It's a one in one thing, one in one out.

48:14.780 --> 48:18.540
Teresa has been living under the threat of bee attacks for two years.

48:18.540 --> 48:22.460
Travis, that must be a fucking Trump card.

48:22.460 --> 48:25.980
And you're like, will you please clean the pans?

48:25.980 --> 48:28.220
And she's like, it's your turn to clean the pans.

48:28.220 --> 48:32.940
And then you point to your beard and you say, I hate to play this card again, but

48:34.060 --> 48:35.420
you want me to just try to get stung?

48:35.980 --> 48:37.100
And then she says no.

48:37.100 --> 48:39.500
That would explain why the last time we all had dinner together,

48:39.500 --> 48:41.820
she was tapping in Morse code on the table.

48:41.820 --> 48:45.660
Please, oh God, please, his beard is filled with bees.

48:45.660 --> 48:46.300
Please help me escape.

48:46.300 --> 48:46.940
It all sucks.

48:46.940 --> 48:48.060
Give me safe harbor.

48:48.060 --> 48:52.940
It also explains why I couldn't hear anything anyone was saying the entire time

48:52.940 --> 48:53.980
because of the buzzing.

48:56.780 --> 48:59.340
Travis probably had an iPod in there that would just fake it.

49:04.220 --> 49:07.660
Where am I going to find an hour long MP3 of bees?

49:07.660 --> 49:18.620
I can, I will Google hour long bee MP3 and, nope.

49:21.420 --> 49:24.460
So that aren't my show, my brother, my brother, me.

49:24.460 --> 49:27.660
We sure hope you've had as much fun listening to it as we have had making it.

49:27.660 --> 49:30.140
I can get an MP3 of bees in the trap by Nicki Minaj.

49:31.420 --> 49:32.220
I'll listen to that.

49:32.220 --> 49:37.500
Thank you to people tweeting about the show using the MBMBAM hashtag.

49:37.500 --> 49:44.380
We've got Turk Rules, Kane, Taylor Wilson, Nicole, Mary Erickson, Mike Susek, Kim Belushi,

49:44.380 --> 49:50.940
Be Root, David Pemberton, Jen and Public, Scotty Moe, Richard E. Flanagan, Sam Bersanti,

49:50.940 --> 49:54.460
Jeff Grubb, Christy Admiral, Justin Sullivan.

49:54.460 --> 49:58.780
Thank you so much to everybody sharing the program.

49:58.780 --> 50:02.140
If you tweet about us, why not include our sampler?

50:02.140 --> 50:05.340
It's bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM 2013.

50:05.340 --> 50:10.780
That's our brand new one just for you to help add people to the ever-growing

50:10.780 --> 50:12.220
my brother, my brother, me family.

50:12.220 --> 50:14.220
And two things real quick.

50:14.220 --> 50:16.780

50:33.660 --> 50:36.540
I just want to make a plea real quick.

50:36.540 --> 50:38.300
Two pleas, actually.

51:08.860 --> 51:10.220
I remember the second thing.

51:10.220 --> 51:15.340

51:15.340 --> 51:21.420
did or if you want to give a shout out to a loved one, just go to maximumfun.org forward

51:21.420 --> 51:24.300
slash Jumbotron and then get you all set up there.

51:24.300 --> 51:28.540
It's $100 for a personal message and $200 for a business message.

51:29.580 --> 51:31.660
So help support the show and we'll help support you.

I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's

51:35.660 --> 51:38.540
a Departure, which is on the album Putting the Days to Bed.

51:40.860 --> 51:43.500
