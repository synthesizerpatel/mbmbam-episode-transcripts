WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:49.520
I also request Mbem Bambly Reunion. I'll do anything to avoid that name.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.680
Oh, look at that. It's Uncle Stewart. Hi, Stu. Hey, it's good to be here. You gonna play some

00:57.680 --> 01:03.440
baggos? Why are you doing this hilarious joke? What are baggos, Uncle Stewart? What are baggos,

01:03.440 --> 01:09.760
you know? Is this a show? We're in it. You might call a cornhole. Oh man, Uncle Stu,

01:09.760 --> 01:17.280
I don't know about that. Yeah, that's not good. It won't be a good joke. Have a bud lime. That

01:17.280 --> 01:23.840
does sound like little Stewie. I'm his brother, Brewer. Guys, wait. Instead of Mbem Bambly Reunion,

01:23.840 --> 01:32.880
we could do Mbem Bamb Family Guy, and then like, oh yes, I'm Stewie. Hi, it's me, Brian.

01:34.640 --> 01:44.960
I am the one they call Cragmire. I will kill you, Stu. Hi, welcome to my brother, my brother,

01:44.960 --> 01:52.080
me Family Guy Reunion. What's your favorite Family Guy? We're bringing back all our favorite.

01:52.080 --> 01:56.880
We're gonna bring, okay, since Max Fund Drive, we're gonna bring, I don't know where to start.

01:56.880 --> 02:00.880
I'm so excited. My name is Justin McElroy. I'm your oldest brother. Let's start there.

02:00.880 --> 02:06.800
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy. I'm, oh my God, I'm Stewie, quote unquote, Griffin.

02:07.760 --> 02:11.440
No, wait, the Stewie should be, I'm Griffin McElroy, the baby brother. And the baby on the

02:11.440 --> 02:17.360
show is, although the baby on the show is also named Stewie. It's maxfundrive, maximumfund.org.

02:17.360 --> 02:28.080
Go donate some money. Oh, not convinced? Check this impression out. Hey, it's me, Lois. I love

02:28.080 --> 02:34.880
you, Peena. I'm the one known as Meg. Please donate to maximumfund.org. Can you not try?

02:37.200 --> 02:44.480
Let me try. I'm Mila Kunis. That's actually pretty good, I thought. It's everybody's favorite joke

02:44.480 --> 02:52.960
from Family Guy. Mine's the one where he fights the chicken. Hey, this sucks. Should we start over?

02:54.000 --> 02:58.880
No. What? Are you kidding me? This has all been hilarious. You're gonna leave this gold on the

02:58.880 --> 03:02.640
cutting room floor? Yeah. You're gonna leave the part where you said we should cut it on the

03:02.640 --> 03:07.520
cutting room floor? How did we even get here? How did we even get to this point? Well, let's pull

03:07.520 --> 03:12.800
back the curtain and talk about the evolution of a bit. This is Goofbusters 2, right? So we wanted

03:12.800 --> 03:17.840
to bring back our old bits, but we didn't have that many funny bits to start with, and we kind

03:17.840 --> 03:22.960
of burned them all last week. So we thought, hey, we should bring back some of our beloved characters

03:23.680 --> 03:28.480
and Travis insisted on calling it a Mabim family reunion. And I said, I would rather die.

03:29.040 --> 03:35.680
And then we started talking. The Family Guy. And then off mic, we had a good, maybe, what do you

03:35.680 --> 03:40.160
think, guys? Like 45 minutes discussion on how important Family Guy was to us in our lives?

03:40.160 --> 03:45.680
Yep. Yeah. How it changed everything, changed the game. And then when we came back from break,

03:45.680 --> 03:51.440
or like not doing the show, Griffin wasn't earnest in his love for Family Guy anymore.

03:51.440 --> 03:56.960
Now it's all about jokey, jokey, ha ha. Some snidely whiplash stuff he's throwing out at

03:56.960 --> 04:06.080
Seth Farlin. Seth McFarlane. I don't know what to say. I guess I'm more of an anime guy now.

04:06.080 --> 04:12.640
Let's talk about the Max Fun Drive, which is a pledge drive for money that we haven't earned

04:12.640 --> 04:17.600
yet. We're going to get there. I knew Justin was going to say that. So I tried, I don't know if

04:17.600 --> 04:22.800
this is good yet. We'll get there though. You know what? We'll get good. Polish this, turd.

04:23.360 --> 04:27.760
That should be the slogan of this show, shouldn't it? It'll get good. Hang in there. You know,

04:27.760 --> 04:31.840
so often you just see the funny parts of a show. You don't see the parts where they're trying to

04:31.840 --> 04:36.400
make it funny. They're trying to will it into comedy. Anyway, it's Max Fun Drive time. This

04:36.400 --> 04:41.200
is the last week, your final chance to get on board, by which I mean you can, you could donate

04:41.200 --> 04:45.440
to the Max Fun community anytime you want. But this is the time where we want you to do it.

04:45.440 --> 04:51.600
And what we want, this is our way or the highway. We're the presidents of this podcast listening

04:51.600 --> 04:58.880
experience. Anyway, what we do here is we're a donor supported network at Max Fun. We are part

04:58.880 --> 05:04.960
of a family of podcasts. Something like what? There's like 24 to a couple dozen podcasts on

05:04.960 --> 05:09.040
the Max Fun network. They're all great. They're all free. You can go to MaxFun.org to listen to

05:09.040 --> 05:13.920
them. But if you like what we do and you want to support us just based on like past episodes,

05:13.920 --> 05:19.280
maybe not this one, then you know, think about kicking in a few bucks a month. You can go to

05:19.280 --> 05:24.640
MaxFun.org slash donate and find out all the pledge gifts that you can get for donating just

05:24.640 --> 05:30.400
by joining in at the $5 a month lowest level that there is. You can get exclusive episodes of our

05:30.400 --> 05:33.840
podcasts and every other podcast on the network. That means extra episodes of Sawbones, extra

05:33.840 --> 05:38.800
episodes of the Adventure Zone, extra episodes of Schmaners and Bunker Buddies. So yeah, we're

05:38.800 --> 05:42.000
going to be talking about it all throughout the show, but let's just get into a question.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.960
Griffin, did you say that $5 a month was the lowest level?

05:45.520 --> 05:46.080
Yeah.

05:46.080 --> 05:49.280
Like Lois Griffin tied it back.

05:49.280 --> 05:53.440
That's good. No, it's very organic.

05:54.240 --> 05:55.120
It's natural.

05:58.080 --> 06:00.800
We've really fallen into a quagmire fairly early.

06:00.800 --> 06:05.040
Fuck off. Read a question. I hate this show. I hate being a part of this show and as soon

06:05.040 --> 06:06.160
as the fun drive is over-

06:06.160 --> 06:07.920
You're sounding pretty stewy, Griffin.

06:08.560 --> 06:10.160
That doesn't even fucking mean anything.

06:10.160 --> 06:17.680
I can't wait until this pleasure drive is over so I can quit this fucking podcast of good

06:17.680 --> 06:18.160
conscience.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.000
Family guy, wouldn't it be funny?

06:30.080 --> 06:31.280
That's fucking good, Griffin.

06:31.280 --> 06:39.600
Guess what city our first question is from? Cleveland.

06:43.200 --> 06:43.760
It's not, though.

06:43.760 --> 06:45.280
Guys, the Skype call dropped off.

06:48.480 --> 06:50.960
I can't hear you laughing. The Skype call dropped off.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.600
And it looks like it's actually from Seattle.

06:55.520 --> 06:57.440
Can we do Frazier instead, please?

06:57.440 --> 06:58.960
Run it back, run it back, run it back.

06:58.960 --> 07:02.800
It's my friend, family, Frazier for union.

07:02.800 --> 07:06.560
Rewind the podcast to the beginning and then it'll be about Frazier this time.

07:07.120 --> 07:07.600
Listener.

07:08.800 --> 07:11.280
Choose your own shitty adventure. Both adventures are going to be

07:11.280 --> 07:13.440
completely devoid of comedic value.

07:13.440 --> 07:16.800
But if you listen to them at the same time, maybe they'll sync up.

07:16.800 --> 07:19.440
I'm a pedestrian in a very populated city.

07:19.440 --> 07:23.840
Fairly not very populated. This isn't fucking Fern Gully. Read good, read better.

07:23.840 --> 07:29.120
We need to earn this. We need to holler for these dollars because right now we are mumbling for them.

07:29.120 --> 07:32.480
We're mumbling for these jumblings and we need to holler for these dollars.

07:32.480 --> 07:33.440
All right. Got it.

07:33.440 --> 07:39.600
I'm a pedestrian in a fairly populated city and I recently encountered a new phenomenon.

07:39.600 --> 07:40.560
It's fairies.

07:41.520 --> 07:46.560
It's fairies everywhere. It's crazy. Tim Curry's a bat. It's bonkers.

07:46.560 --> 07:50.400
When cars are waiting to pull into garages or parking lots,

07:50.400 --> 07:54.400
I like to wait and gesture to let them by since it's faster and safer for general traffic.

07:54.960 --> 07:57.440
Recently, however, cars have been honking at me

07:57.440 --> 08:01.440
and angrily waving their hands to get me to cross my section of sidewalk.

08:02.480 --> 08:05.040
That's from Nancy Sinatra in Seattle.

08:05.040 --> 08:05.360
Whoa.

08:05.360 --> 08:05.760
Not so much a-

08:05.760 --> 08:07.120
Big hit, first off.

08:07.120 --> 08:07.440
Yeah.

08:09.280 --> 08:13.680
Not so much a question in the traditional sense.

08:13.680 --> 08:14.960
Yeah, not really.

08:14.960 --> 08:17.120
Travis, did you edit out the question part of that question?

08:17.120 --> 08:18.640
I don't think so.

08:18.640 --> 08:21.360
I think there's just an implied, what should I do?

08:21.360 --> 08:23.840
I mean, this is the same phenomenon of like you're walking down a hallway

08:23.840 --> 08:26.240
and another person's walking towards you and you go left and they go left

08:26.240 --> 08:27.200
and you go right and they go right,

08:27.200 --> 08:31.680
except if the other person weighed like one and a half metric tons

08:31.680 --> 08:36.320
and was made of steel and combustible fluid and-

08:36.320 --> 08:37.920
Have you ever did that with Robocop?

08:38.640 --> 08:39.200
Yeah.

08:39.200 --> 08:43.200
I think the problem here is that cars are equipped with a horn and humans are not.

08:44.320 --> 08:45.520
That is, yeah.

08:45.520 --> 08:49.360
Well, I mean, but I take away from this that we need human horns.

08:49.360 --> 08:52.880
Don't even get me started on fucking my whole great job theory again,

08:52.880 --> 08:54.160
but I would argue that humans are-

08:54.160 --> 08:55.280
Goofbusters, it's back.

08:55.840 --> 08:56.240
It's back.

08:56.240 --> 08:57.440
There's one friend of the family.

08:58.560 --> 09:01.840
I would argue that humans are actually equipped with an infinite number of horns,

09:01.840 --> 09:04.560
which is to say our brains and our voices and stuff.

09:05.120 --> 09:05.440
Right.

09:05.440 --> 09:06.160
You know what I mean?

09:06.160 --> 09:07.840
Well, so there must have more than one.

09:07.840 --> 09:11.040
When somebody honks at you to like cross the sidewalk quicker.

09:11.040 --> 09:12.880
Okay, I would go, no, you go.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.600
And if I yell loud enough, then it's kind of like a car horn.

09:16.560 --> 09:18.400
I feel like the car should have the right of way.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.680
They're big and I'm little.

09:21.680 --> 09:23.360
Well, no, pedestrians almost always have the right of way,

09:23.360 --> 09:24.800
but I totally feel what you're saying, Travis.

09:25.680 --> 09:27.840
I think an easier law to sort of comprehend,

09:27.840 --> 09:31.360
a more universal law would be the heavier thing gets to go first.

09:31.360 --> 09:36.720
Because if we go at the same time, they are having a lot of damage to me.

09:36.720 --> 09:38.640
I am not doing a lot of damage to them.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.760
I'm at a much higher risk.

09:41.760 --> 09:43.600
Whichever thing could kick the other thing's ass.

09:44.560 --> 09:45.040
You win.

09:45.040 --> 09:45.600
Like you win.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.840
If you're in a big old fucking Ford truck,

09:47.840 --> 09:51.920
fucking Hemi engine, big old chrome tires and-

09:51.920 --> 09:54.000
With like the truck nuts hanging off the back.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.760
Oh, it's fucking too big.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.520
Like custom made truck nuts,

09:57.520 --> 10:03.120
because the ones they sold at AutoZone weren't big and fucking nutty enough for you.

10:03.120 --> 10:05.840
You need your own fucking custom made huge old-

10:05.840 --> 10:09.040
Maybe you got two on the back, two on the front, and two on each side.

10:09.040 --> 10:13.440
Oh, you got a basically a little, like a Ben Hur chariot of truck nuts.

10:13.440 --> 10:15.200
You just octo nutting everywhere you go.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.600
Just octoing all over the spot.

10:17.600 --> 10:18.880
I forgot what we were talking about,

10:18.880 --> 10:21.840
because I started getting boned up for his cool old truck.

10:22.720 --> 10:25.360
I had a driver's ed teacher I've talked about before.

10:25.920 --> 10:28.800
He was the dude that showed us Mr. Holland's Opus,

10:28.800 --> 10:30.640
because he kind of looked like Richard Dreyfuss.

10:30.640 --> 10:36.480
What, that was his metric for educational content?

10:36.480 --> 10:37.440
Yeah, he said like,

10:37.440 --> 10:40.720
you have to check, like this is what this dude is so great at teaching.

10:40.720 --> 10:42.000
You say, you have to check this out.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.200
I look just like this fool.

10:43.760 --> 10:44.080
Did he?

10:44.080 --> 10:45.440
And he didn't fast forward to that part.

10:45.440 --> 10:46.960
He's like, yeah, you won't appreciate it.

10:46.960 --> 10:48.000
Let's just watch the whole film.

10:49.360 --> 10:51.360
Which is pretty great, like pretty cool.

10:51.360 --> 10:56.240
But he, the driver's ed lesson that I remember most from that class,

10:56.240 --> 11:00.960
is he said, you pull up to a four-way intersection,

11:00.960 --> 11:06.880
and you and a semi truck get to the intersection at roughly the same time.

11:06.880 --> 11:10.000
And that truck is on your left who has the right-of-way.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.440
And I started to think about it.

11:11.440 --> 11:13.120
He said, you thought too long.

11:13.120 --> 11:14.080
It's a semi truck.

11:15.120 --> 11:19.440
If you go and he hits you, you die and his day is ruined.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.120
You go ahead and let him go.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.400
And I was like, yeah, that's true.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.960
Just like always let the big thing go ahead.

11:24.960 --> 11:27.680
I don't like that that implies that he would only be haunted

11:27.680 --> 11:29.520
by causing your death for one day.

11:30.160 --> 11:31.680
The next day he'd wake up and be like,

11:31.680 --> 11:33.280
you know what, I'm not worried about it anymore.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.680
Truck drivers are, they're an immoral lot.

11:35.680 --> 11:38.240
I mean, most of them.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.280
And I don't want to cast this person

11:39.280 --> 11:42.960
because I'm sure we have a bunch of fucking highwaymen.

11:42.960 --> 11:45.840
Our trucker listeners, there's got to be some out there, right?

11:46.640 --> 11:47.680
That should be our new thing.

11:47.680 --> 11:49.360
Like let's get into that life.

11:49.360 --> 11:52.480
They're long hauling across this great country of ours.

11:52.480 --> 11:56.240
A bunch of highwaymen and women listening to this show.

11:56.240 --> 11:58.400
I don't want to throw shade on them,

11:58.400 --> 12:01.040
but most of them are in a sort of hitcher situation.

12:01.040 --> 12:02.880
I mean, most of them are.

12:02.880 --> 12:05.360
Yeah, because you're just constantly crossing the straight lines.

12:05.360 --> 12:07.760
You're in international waters basically all the time.

12:07.760 --> 12:12.720
Anyway, we just didn't do this at all

12:12.720 --> 12:15.280
because this person does try to give cars the right way,

12:15.280 --> 12:16.960
but cars are like fighting back.

12:16.960 --> 12:19.280
Maybe they're thinking they're getting catfished.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.160
So the car's like, no, I've been in this insurance scam before.

12:22.160 --> 12:25.760
You tell me to go, I go, you go out, I hit you.

12:25.760 --> 12:29.280
Oops-a-daisy, you just made $35,000 off of me.

12:29.280 --> 12:30.400
I'm not doing it.

12:30.400 --> 12:33.280
I love that the cars jump to anger.

12:33.280 --> 12:35.440
Like, I tried to let you go and you didn't do it.

12:35.440 --> 12:36.320
And now I hate you.

12:37.040 --> 12:38.480
That's so funny to me.

12:38.480 --> 12:40.640
Instead of just that play, like, no, I insist, you go.

12:40.640 --> 12:43.120
Yeah, but you have to have, but think about it.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.200
Like if you're inside a car,

12:45.200 --> 12:48.400
you do have to have a somewhat like heightened response

12:48.400 --> 12:51.280
because otherwise it's like, what is that guy doing?

12:51.280 --> 12:53.200
Is he talking to someone on his Bluetooth?

12:53.200 --> 12:54.240
I don't understand.

12:55.360 --> 12:58.240
This is why you just need a series of like Wile E. Coyote signs

12:58.240 --> 13:00.480
that are like, I insist that you go, please.

13:00.480 --> 13:01.840
I'm letting you go.

13:01.840 --> 13:05.600
Let's bust a goof in this Yahoo.

13:05.600 --> 13:06.080
Okay.

13:06.080 --> 13:07.760
And it was-

13:07.760 --> 13:09.040
Just bust a goof.

13:09.040 --> 13:09.760
It was sent in.

13:10.880 --> 13:11.600
It was sent in.

13:11.600 --> 13:12.160
You got it.

13:12.160 --> 13:13.360
Okay, it was sent in.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.520
You want it, baby.

13:15.520 --> 13:16.720
Just bust a goof.

13:16.720 --> 13:17.520
Okay, now go.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.240
On a mission, guys like this.

13:23.440 --> 13:25.760
Thank you, Marina Baker, who sent this in.

13:26.480 --> 13:29.760
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Monica is the best.

13:30.480 --> 13:31.200
Nice.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.800
Nice.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.240
Monica is the best.

13:34.240 --> 13:37.200
I feel like, a quick sidebar about Monica.

13:37.200 --> 13:40.000
I feel like she maybe is dealing

13:40.000 --> 13:42.160
with some inaccuracy issues.

13:42.160 --> 13:45.680
Like she has to reinforce her bestness everywhere even

13:45.680 --> 13:48.720
and including like her Yahoo Answers profile.

13:50.240 --> 13:52.000
Oh, her answer game is strong though

13:52.000 --> 13:53.280
because her question is this.

13:53.280 --> 13:56.320
How do you politely refuse to let someone ride your horse?

13:57.760 --> 13:59.920
Let's tap into that horse vein, brothers.

13:59.920 --> 14:03.520
Well, we got to take that long ass data needle

14:03.520 --> 14:05.760
from the matrix, lie back in our cool ass recliners

14:05.760 --> 14:07.440
and have Samuel Fishburne.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.280
That's not his name, but let's have him jack us in.

14:11.280 --> 14:12.080
We're in.

14:12.080 --> 14:14.080
All the horses are-

14:14.080 --> 14:15.280
Come with me, Joey Pants.

14:15.280 --> 14:16.480
Let's ride this horse together.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.440
There is no horse.

14:18.480 --> 14:19.680
Whoa, that's sad.

14:19.680 --> 14:21.200
No, there's millions of horses.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.680
Wait, so there's either no horse or too many horses.

14:23.680 --> 14:25.760
This is the scene where there's like fucking

14:25.760 --> 14:28.960
an infinite library of like gun racks comes flying at us

14:28.960 --> 14:30.160
but they're all full of horses.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.600
And these horses are freaking the fuck out.

14:31.600 --> 14:32.800
Can you even imagine?

14:32.800 --> 14:33.600
Imagine the noise.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.440
Everybody stop and imagine the noise.

14:35.440 --> 14:36.800
Now imagine the smell.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.200
Bring in the noise, bring in the smell.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.760
How do you politely refuse to let someone ride your horse?

14:45.760 --> 14:47.440
You blame it on the aura, baby.

14:47.440 --> 14:48.160
I have a friend-

14:48.160 --> 14:51.280
Wait, hold on, Travis.

14:51.280 --> 14:52.400
Sit on that.

14:52.400 --> 14:53.920
Say it as soon as Griffin's done

14:53.920 --> 14:55.760
because I don't want that to get passed by.

14:55.760 --> 14:56.400
It's amazing.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.400
Griffin, finish the question.

14:58.400 --> 15:01.360
I have a quote unquote friend from school

15:01.360 --> 15:02.960
who is extremely full of herself

15:02.960 --> 15:04.720
and thinks she is a wonderful rider.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.560
She took lessons for a month, fell off on the second week

15:08.560 --> 15:11.920
and is generally a bloody awful rider.

15:11.920 --> 15:14.880
She claims, sorry, a bloody awful rider.

15:15.760 --> 15:18.720
She claims to know everything and do everything

15:18.720 --> 15:20.960
and has asked to ride my horse.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.520
How do I politely refuse to let her ride?

15:23.520 --> 15:25.520
I don't want to make an enemies

15:25.520 --> 15:28.640
and I've let other more responsible friends ride

15:28.640 --> 15:29.840
with me lunging them.

15:29.840 --> 15:31.360
No idea what the fuck that means.

15:31.360 --> 15:32.400
Update, edit.

15:32.960 --> 15:35.200
It's not even so much that she doesn't know how to ride

15:35.200 --> 15:36.560
that she is so irresponsible

15:36.560 --> 15:38.320
and does not treat the horse as well.

15:38.320 --> 15:41.200
She blames everything on them, flops and hits

15:41.200 --> 15:42.480
and is not trustworthy.

15:43.280 --> 15:44.720
You gotta blame it on the aura, baby.

15:44.720 --> 15:45.840
Okay, so there's the aura line

15:45.840 --> 15:47.360
that we're all waiting for on pins and needles.

15:47.360 --> 15:48.720
And what does that mean, Travis?

15:48.720 --> 15:53.360
Well, you say like Mr. Floppington spoke to me in a dream

15:53.360 --> 15:57.840
and said that his energy and your energy were mixed well.

15:57.840 --> 15:59.840
I'm sorry, I just can't do this to him.

15:59.840 --> 16:00.960
He's like a son to me.

16:02.080 --> 16:07.120
The moon is in a waxing phase and Mr. Butterballs.

16:07.680 --> 16:08.720
No, that's a terrible-

16:08.720 --> 16:09.440
Mr. Truck Nuts.

16:10.880 --> 16:11.360
Holy shit.

16:11.360 --> 16:11.920
I'm just Truck Nuts.

16:13.680 --> 16:15.440
He went to medical school for seven years.

16:15.440 --> 16:17.200
Please use his correct honorific.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.440
I'm sorry, you have lupus.

16:21.440 --> 16:21.840
Damn it.

16:21.840 --> 16:26.880
Oh, it's kind of better now though.

16:27.680 --> 16:29.760
Do you think that the word honorific

16:29.760 --> 16:32.000
was created by the first person to get one?

16:32.560 --> 16:34.960
Like the first person to put doctor at the front of their name

16:34.960 --> 16:36.800
like this is really good.

16:36.800 --> 16:37.280
You know what?

16:38.320 --> 16:39.760
It's honorific.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.200
I'm so proud of me.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.760
What a great job I did at being the first doctor.

16:47.600 --> 16:48.480
I'm hippogrates.

16:48.480 --> 16:53.600
Wait until halfway on and then push them off.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.440
And be like, I guess today's not your day.

16:56.400 --> 16:57.840
But don't let them know that you did.

16:57.840 --> 17:00.160
Ooh, you train the horse to do that thing

17:00.160 --> 17:03.440
where you usually see it with people being a jerk in a car.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.800
But as the person is about to get on,

17:04.800 --> 17:08.080
the horse takes one step forward and just keeps doing that

17:08.080 --> 17:09.840
until the person gets frustrated and gives up.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.440
That's another good thing.

17:11.440 --> 17:17.200
Yeah, anything you can do to sort of put the social blame on the horse

17:17.200 --> 17:20.320
and not you is gonna be good.

17:20.320 --> 17:21.920
It's just gonna be, how do you tell your horse

17:21.920 --> 17:25.040
to only do that to this horrible person and not to say you?

17:25.680 --> 17:27.040
You gotta blame it on the aura.

17:27.040 --> 17:30.240
Okay, that doesn't, horses don't understand what an aura is.

17:30.240 --> 17:31.680
Well, fuck you they don't.

17:31.680 --> 17:32.480
Yeah, you're right.

17:32.480 --> 17:35.360
I said it and then I immediately knew I was wrong.

17:35.360 --> 17:36.160
I got it.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.160
I got it.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.800
Oh boy, I know where this is going immediately.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.000
Wait a minute.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.080
Let me put some jam up in it.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.400
Just put some jelly on your horse.

17:46.400 --> 17:49.280
No, hold on, because you definitely said in.

17:51.120 --> 17:52.560
And I don't think Dr. Tratton.

17:52.560 --> 17:54.000
Like in the saddle area.

17:54.000 --> 17:54.960
Oh, okay, okay.

17:54.960 --> 17:59.280
Right, so yeah, you just put some jelly on a horse's saddle

18:00.960 --> 18:05.360
and on like, you know, they call it a saddle Narbon.

18:05.360 --> 18:07.200
It's the front thing that's on the front of the saddle.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.440
Is that really what it's called?

18:09.440 --> 18:10.720
Yeah, it's a saddle Narbon.

18:11.520 --> 18:12.480
Narbon or Narbon?

18:13.200 --> 18:15.360
It depends on what area you're in of the country.

18:15.360 --> 18:18.240
Yeah, it's a regional thing like soda pop or Coca-Cola.

18:18.240 --> 18:19.440
Or proboscis.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.120
Or proboscis or proboscis.

18:21.120 --> 18:24.000
It's different strokes for different horses.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.840
And you put some jelly on that

18:25.840 --> 18:27.680
and just put some jelly on the saddle.

18:27.680 --> 18:30.480
And then when the person goes to hop up on your horse,

18:30.480 --> 18:31.600
they're gonna put one hand on that

18:31.600 --> 18:33.280
and think the horse has some secretions

18:33.280 --> 18:35.200
that need to be dealt with emergently.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.600
Saddle word, secretions.

18:39.120 --> 18:40.480
His saddle is bleeding.

18:40.480 --> 18:42.240
It's oozing exclusively from the saddle.

18:42.240 --> 18:43.840
See, I wanna actually backpedal a little bit.

18:43.840 --> 18:45.600
And I do wanna talk about the possibility

18:45.600 --> 18:47.280
of putting some jam up in it.

18:47.280 --> 18:50.800
I'm talking about creating some sort of equine Jaffa cake

18:52.000 --> 18:55.360
situation because that is going to make the horse very sick.

18:55.360 --> 18:56.800
And that horse is just not gonna feel like

18:56.800 --> 18:57.920
riding that particular day.

18:57.920 --> 18:59.120
So every time that, you know,

18:59.680 --> 19:01.760
Marcy comes over and is like, let me get up on that.

19:01.760 --> 19:02.480
You're like, yeah, sure.

19:02.480 --> 19:03.520
Let me just take them in the stable.

19:03.520 --> 19:04.320
It's oats time.

19:04.320 --> 19:05.040
It's oats o'clock.

19:05.040 --> 19:07.600
But then it's actually, it's fucking like jam o'clock.

19:08.720 --> 19:10.880
What about an elaborate like ocean to like,

19:10.880 --> 19:14.080
you bring Marcy to just like an empty stable

19:14.080 --> 19:14.960
and you're like, what?

19:14.960 --> 19:18.560
Oh no, someone's stolen Dr. Truck nuts.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.360
And then you put what they do find,

19:21.360 --> 19:24.880
he's got jelly on him when you find him.

19:24.880 --> 19:26.240
Okay, it sounds like you kinda-

19:26.240 --> 19:28.160
We have plans on plans on plans.

19:29.200 --> 19:32.480
What if you try to put so much jelly into your horse,

19:32.480 --> 19:34.080
but instead of making it really sick,

19:34.080 --> 19:35.440
he just fucking loves it.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.600
And then you're left with like one of the most terrifying

19:37.600 --> 19:38.560
things in nature,

19:38.560 --> 19:42.320
which is a horse addicted to a bobble

19:42.320 --> 19:43.520
from the world of man.

19:43.520 --> 19:46.160
What if the fucking jam makes him super fast?

19:46.160 --> 19:47.440
Yeah, it makes him so fast,

19:47.440 --> 19:49.760
but he's like, bring me the gelatinous ambrosia.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.240
Somebody put jelly on the sea biscuit

19:52.240 --> 19:53.600
and now he's super fast.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.600
We all have an ethical responsibility

19:57.600 --> 20:01.600
to make sure that horses don't get too comfortable

20:01.600 --> 20:02.400
in the man world.

20:03.040 --> 20:04.480
Cause once they do like they're,

20:05.440 --> 20:07.280
it's kind of like a Skynet situation, right?

20:07.280 --> 20:08.720
Like in our studies with AI,

20:08.720 --> 20:12.000
frankly, Google, you're toeing a fucking fine line.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.680
You're on thin ice with your go bot.

20:14.560 --> 20:16.880
I'm worried that we could get that with a horse though.

20:16.880 --> 20:19.120
Like really easily, it would just tip over

20:19.120 --> 20:21.840
and then like, that's it, we're all horses now.

20:21.840 --> 20:22.960
I'm like, I'm sorry,

20:22.960 --> 20:26.160
but you have already just described Orb.

20:26.160 --> 20:27.440
Basically that's all.

20:27.440 --> 20:28.480
Yeah, that's not true.

20:28.480 --> 20:30.960
Orb got too interested in the things of man

20:30.960 --> 20:33.200
and can no longer return to the equestral plane.

20:34.080 --> 20:36.160
That's right, somebody wins the triple crown.

20:36.160 --> 20:38.480
And by somebody, I mean a horse.

20:40.080 --> 20:42.080
And they immediately, immediately like,

20:42.080 --> 20:44.080
congratulations, you got three trophies.

20:44.080 --> 20:44.880
Blam!

20:44.880 --> 20:46.000
Like you can't, you can't.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.040
You're too big, too strong.

20:47.040 --> 20:48.080
You must be destroyed.

20:50.480 --> 20:52.640
Too big, too strong, too beloved.

20:52.640 --> 20:53.360
Are you kidding me?

20:53.360 --> 20:55.680
Fucking American Pharaoh like walks down

20:55.680 --> 20:58.640
that victory lane with a wreath around its neck

20:58.640 --> 21:00.400
and just like everybody's just handing it

21:00.400 --> 21:02.160
big fucking fistfuls of jam.

21:02.800 --> 21:03.920
Like that's it.

21:03.920 --> 21:04.400
That's it.

21:04.960 --> 21:05.360
That's it.

21:05.360 --> 21:08.960
He's gonna evolve into like rapidash

21:08.960 --> 21:09.760
and then that's it.

21:09.760 --> 21:10.320
We're done.

21:10.880 --> 21:13.040
I bet your horses are very petty.

21:13.040 --> 21:15.280
By which I mean, I bet if you win a big horse race-

21:15.280 --> 21:17.280
Justin, you said pretty wrong.

21:17.280 --> 21:17.920
Oh, sorry.

21:19.040 --> 21:21.040
No, I literally mean petty.

21:21.040 --> 21:23.680
I bet like if a horse wins a huge race,

21:23.680 --> 21:26.160
like the Kentucky one,

21:26.160 --> 21:27.760
then they spend the rest of the day

21:28.320 --> 21:29.680
following their jockey around

21:29.680 --> 21:30.880
waiting to hear him say,

21:30.880 --> 21:32.000
hey, I won.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.360
Cause then it's like, did you?

21:33.360 --> 21:35.680
Did you win?

21:35.680 --> 21:38.640
Cause I remember running very fast,

21:38.640 --> 21:41.120
faster than all the other horses in a circle.

21:41.120 --> 21:43.360
And I remember you fucking chilling

21:43.360 --> 21:45.920
and flipping through your iPod Nano

21:45.920 --> 21:48.800
looking for a Jodeci track you haven't heard in a while.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.640
We could figure this thing out right now

21:50.640 --> 21:52.480
if you just want to do a quick foot race.

21:52.480 --> 21:53.360
Let's get to the bottom of this,

21:53.360 --> 21:54.720
which is a quick friendly foot race.

21:54.720 --> 21:55.360
What do you say?

21:55.360 --> 21:56.640
Do you know, side note,

21:56.640 --> 21:58.240
I just found this out the other day,

21:58.240 --> 21:59.440
when a horse studs,

21:59.440 --> 22:01.920
like when there's like a champion racehorse dude

22:01.920 --> 22:03.520
and he goes to a farm to stud,

22:04.160 --> 22:09.280
it can be like $75,000 for like one mating.

22:09.280 --> 22:10.160
For one nut.

22:10.880 --> 22:11.760
For one nut.

22:11.760 --> 22:12.800
What if the nut don't take?

22:13.600 --> 22:16.240
Well, for Dr. Truck nuts, it always takes.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.080
That's no problemo for me, my man.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.040
Let's just leave it at that.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.040
How do you think he got his name?

22:24.160 --> 22:26.080
I mean, you got to imagine, Travis,

22:26.080 --> 22:28.080
like you're talking about

22:28.080 --> 22:30.080
they are paying for one night

22:30.080 --> 22:32.560
with the world's best horse.

22:34.400 --> 22:35.280
That's like,

22:35.280 --> 22:36.800
that seems like actually 75k

22:36.800 --> 22:38.880
actually seems like pretty low.

22:38.880 --> 22:40.480
Like yeah, you're getting that good seed,

22:40.480 --> 22:41.040
whatever.

22:41.040 --> 22:44.400
You're going to get that good coat.

22:47.280 --> 22:49.680
We're bleeding a little bit into farm wisdom here.

22:49.680 --> 22:53.360
But we're also like talking about like one night

22:53.360 --> 22:56.880
with the best, biggest, most badass,

22:56.880 --> 22:58.960
most perfect, most like popular,

22:58.960 --> 23:01.200
most famous, most successful horse.

23:01.840 --> 23:02.800
I think there are plenty of people

23:02.800 --> 23:04.640
that would pay 75 large

23:04.640 --> 23:07.200
to bone down with like, what?

23:07.200 --> 23:08.880
Like Clooney?

23:08.880 --> 23:10.320
That's actually 75 Gs.

23:10.320 --> 23:11.680
That's like nothing.

23:11.680 --> 23:13.200
Like Robert Redford paid,

23:13.200 --> 23:15.520
offered Woody Harrelson a milo.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.040
To sleep with Woody Harrelson.

23:17.040 --> 23:18.720
To sleep with Woody Harrelson.

23:18.720 --> 23:19.360
In real life.

23:19.920 --> 23:20.560
Then they were like,

23:21.440 --> 23:22.640
we should make a film together.

23:24.160 --> 23:25.600
Or they were like, and cut.

23:26.160 --> 23:26.960
And then Redford was like,

23:26.960 --> 23:29.520
so what do you think?

23:29.520 --> 23:31.440
Oh man, I thought that was just play acting.

23:31.440 --> 23:33.600
I thought that we were just doing a play acting thing.

23:33.600 --> 23:37.040
No, I want to squish that.

23:38.640 --> 23:38.880
Robert.

23:38.880 --> 23:39.760
Justin.

23:39.760 --> 23:40.240
Yeah.

23:40.240 --> 23:41.840
Would you give me a farm wisdom theme song, please?

23:41.840 --> 23:43.280
I have something I'd like to share with the folks.

23:43.280 --> 23:44.000
Oh, I have one too.

23:44.720 --> 23:45.760
Okay, we'll do both.

23:45.760 --> 23:47.120
Farm wisdom.

23:47.920 --> 23:48.960
Farm wisdom.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.520
Plant some seeds to grow some weeds.

23:51.520 --> 23:52.400
Farm wisdom.

23:53.200 --> 23:53.760
I liked it.

23:53.760 --> 23:58.000
But when horses are like being prepared for mating,

23:58.000 --> 24:01.200
they bring out like a prepper dude horse

24:01.200 --> 24:03.680
and they like put his wiener in a bag

24:03.680 --> 24:05.440
and tie it up to his stomach

24:05.440 --> 24:08.560
and let him get the female like all raring to go

24:08.560 --> 24:10.400
with like all the foreplay and stuff.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.240
And then they bring the stud horse in.

24:12.240 --> 24:14.640
They've covered his hooves with silken gloves

24:14.640 --> 24:17.120
so he does not damage the female horse.

24:17.120 --> 24:18.960
He comes in at the last minute,

24:18.960 --> 24:20.560
does the thing and then leaves.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.560
So he just comes in for the last part

24:22.560 --> 24:24.720
and someone paid $75,000 for that.

24:25.280 --> 24:26.720
That was a gross farm wisdom.

24:26.720 --> 24:30.560
We try to foster like sort of an environment of,

24:31.360 --> 24:36.800
you know, learning and just growth, I guess.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.240
And to me, Travis, that felt like

24:38.240 --> 24:39.840
you were just kind of click baiting,

24:39.840 --> 24:40.640
like just kind of getting some salacious-

24:40.640 --> 24:42.160
The idea of a dude horse's wiener

24:42.160 --> 24:43.600
being strapped down to his tummy

24:43.600 --> 24:44.880
is that interesting, Griffin?

24:45.440 --> 24:47.280
I think, no, I think you were mostly going

24:47.280 --> 24:49.280
for that like raw sex SEO.

24:50.480 --> 24:51.440
I mean, sometimes.

24:51.440 --> 24:52.240
It's Max Fun Drive.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.680
We talk about horse wieners.

24:53.680 --> 24:55.120
I have another farm wisdom here

24:55.120 --> 24:57.120
and this one is not yucky.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.640
Let's just call it what it is.

24:58.640 --> 25:00.160
I found Travis's interesting.

25:01.120 --> 25:02.800
Where did the first horse come from, Travis?

25:03.360 --> 25:06.960
He's just like, I think he's just like at the farm.

25:06.960 --> 25:09.200
Is it the same horse every time?

25:09.200 --> 25:11.440
Like, does he have like one horse

25:11.440 --> 25:13.360
like that's just romance-centric?

25:14.240 --> 25:16.240
What they do is they get him all charged up

25:16.240 --> 25:18.640
with the mare horse and then they take him

25:18.640 --> 25:23.120
to like some like not famous race horse,

25:23.120 --> 25:24.960
mare horse, and let him go to town there

25:24.960 --> 25:26.960
so that he doesn't get all upset

25:26.960 --> 25:29.760
and go crazy on everybody.

25:29.760 --> 25:31.760
How does that interaction work?

25:31.760 --> 25:34.080
Like, listen, Dr. Trust Nuts,

25:34.080 --> 25:36.640
you gots to trust me on this one.

25:38.160 --> 25:38.880
No, are you sure?

25:39.520 --> 25:41.040
I'm having like a lot of fun in it.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.560
No, trust me, trust me.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.800
Dr. Trust Nuts, that's your new name.

25:45.920 --> 25:46.960
Listen, Dr. Trust Nuts,

25:46.960 --> 25:48.720
I need you to be Dr. Trust Nuts right now.

25:51.520 --> 25:54.320
I'm gonna, bro, bro, bro, have I ever let you down?

25:54.320 --> 25:56.240
I'm gonna fucking hollow you out, son.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.080
That's what they should make him race.

26:02.640 --> 26:05.040
Like they should try to clock a time on him then.

26:05.040 --> 26:07.600
I bet he'd be like performing really very well.

26:10.240 --> 26:12.320
I know in college whenever I had a big audition,

26:12.320 --> 26:14.480
I would always wait to pee until afterwards.

26:14.480 --> 26:16.400
So it's probably the same thing.

26:16.400 --> 26:19.040
Just have some sort of barn intern

26:20.320 --> 26:22.000
standing right behind a finish line

26:22.000 --> 26:24.720
with a glossy JPEG of a horse vagina.

26:25.360 --> 26:25.680
Come on.

26:28.640 --> 26:30.640
I have another one here and it's not horse related.

26:31.360 --> 26:32.320
Are llamas horses?

26:32.320 --> 26:34.000
Has anyone ever gotten to the bottom of this?

26:34.000 --> 26:34.960
Space horses.

26:34.960 --> 26:35.360
All right.

26:36.800 --> 26:39.040
Here's some farm wisdom sent in by Tom Harriman.

26:39.040 --> 26:39.600
Thank you, Tom.

26:40.480 --> 26:42.640
If you want to protect your livestock

26:42.640 --> 26:44.960
such as sheep and goats against predators,

26:44.960 --> 26:46.960
add a llama to the herd.

26:46.960 --> 26:49.360
The llama will act as a guard for the animals

26:49.360 --> 26:52.000
going so far as to fight off attacks by coyotes,

26:52.000 --> 26:53.600
wolves, and dogs.

26:53.600 --> 26:54.480
If you go this route,

26:54.480 --> 26:56.160
it's important that you only get one llama

26:56.160 --> 26:58.880
because you want it to bond with the herd it's protecting.

26:58.880 --> 27:00.400
It's true if you get two llamas in there,

27:00.400 --> 27:02.480
they're just gonna talk to each other.

27:02.480 --> 27:04.560
It's like me at a party with like one other person I know.

27:04.560 --> 27:06.160
I'm not making new friends at that party.

27:07.520 --> 27:09.920
I love this idea because I've actually seen this happen.

27:09.920 --> 27:12.800
Not this exact thing, but very similar thing in practice

27:12.800 --> 27:15.760
because Buttercup, my dog, hates pigeons.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.680
The other day I was walking around a park

27:17.680 --> 27:20.000
where there were pigeons and swans mixed together.

27:20.000 --> 27:20.320
Yeah.

27:20.320 --> 27:21.600
Or maybe it was geese.

27:21.600 --> 27:22.560
It was geese.

27:22.560 --> 27:23.920
Geese and pigeons mixed together.

27:24.480 --> 27:26.400
And she started to chase a pigeon

27:26.400 --> 27:28.560
and then saw a giant goose and she was like,

27:28.560 --> 27:30.960
oh shit, it's the pigeon's mom.

27:30.960 --> 27:32.880
And she immediately hid behind my legs.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.200
Yeah, animals are like wicked dumb

27:35.200 --> 27:36.800
and if they see a bunch of animals together,

27:36.800 --> 27:37.760
they will assume anything.

27:37.760 --> 27:40.400
Like if there was a bunch of rats

27:40.400 --> 27:41.840
fighting over a bag of Doritos,

27:41.840 --> 27:43.600
an animal might look at that and be like,

27:43.600 --> 27:47.200
how come that one rat is orange and plasticky

27:47.200 --> 27:48.400
and it says Doritos on him?

27:49.600 --> 27:50.560
Well, he's Doritos rat.

27:50.560 --> 27:51.920
Get that shit up on BuzzFeed.

27:53.040 --> 27:57.840
But if you see a bunch of sheep and add a llama to it,

27:57.840 --> 27:59.520
I mean, they're both wool producing creatures.

27:59.520 --> 28:00.480
It's not that much of a stretch.

28:00.480 --> 28:03.680
It's just this one sheep is like super duper duper fucked up.

28:03.680 --> 28:04.640
I don't wanna mess with that.

28:05.200 --> 28:07.040
I don't know what that one sheep's capable of.

28:07.040 --> 28:08.960
Don't you think that's messed up for the llama though?

28:08.960 --> 28:10.560
It's like an ugly duckling situation.

28:10.560 --> 28:12.000
We're like, why am I so big?

28:12.000 --> 28:14.160
I mean, they're probably like down as fuck

28:14.160 --> 28:15.200
because they're like super tall

28:15.200 --> 28:16.240
and they probably feel like in charge

28:16.240 --> 28:17.920
and they could have any one of those sheep that they want.

28:20.320 --> 28:21.440
If you stud out a llama,

28:21.440 --> 28:23.360
it's important to do it with a sheep

28:23.360 --> 28:24.480
because then you get double wool.

28:26.320 --> 28:27.920
And like a medium sized llama.

28:28.480 --> 28:28.800
Yeah.

28:29.840 --> 28:32.400
I wouldn't it be a bummer to be a llama

28:32.400 --> 28:34.240
and they're like, hey, we got a new home for you

28:34.240 --> 28:36.640
and they pull up and you just see a bunch of sheep

28:36.640 --> 28:38.480
and you're like, I know what this is.

28:38.480 --> 28:40.000
I don't know anybody here.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.400
Okay, I see what we're doing.

28:42.400 --> 28:44.400
Okay, all right, I get it.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.360
Okay, yep.

28:47.360 --> 28:48.560
Give me the over under.

28:49.760 --> 28:51.520
I'm trying to wrap my mind around this farm wisdom

28:51.520 --> 28:52.720
that Tom Harriman sent in.

28:52.720 --> 28:53.280
Thank you, Tom.

28:54.080 --> 28:56.640
Because I'm trying to like, what's the over under?

28:58.240 --> 29:00.000
Let's put them both in a ring.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.920
Coyote V. Llama.

29:01.920 --> 29:06.800
Llama has reach, I suppose, spit.

29:06.800 --> 29:11.200
If you want to take it to fucking Pokemon attack levels,

29:11.200 --> 29:13.760
you can spit in the coyote's eyes, maybe.

29:13.760 --> 29:16.480
It seems that would require a lot of accuracy.

29:17.520 --> 29:20.160
I don't think that's a llama's strongest statistic.

29:20.160 --> 29:24.160
I'm pretty sure a llama can leap all four feet off the ground.

29:25.440 --> 29:26.720
They are very prancy.

29:26.720 --> 29:27.760
What are you basing that on?

29:28.880 --> 29:29.280
Nothing.

29:29.920 --> 29:30.480
Okay.

29:30.480 --> 29:32.880
There was that one Spike Lee commercial

29:32.880 --> 29:35.040
when he was staring at a bunch of jumping llamas

29:35.040 --> 29:37.040
and he was like, it's gotta be the shoes.

29:37.040 --> 29:39.200
And the llamas are like, we don't wear shoes.

29:42.080 --> 29:44.320
Mostly I'm basing it on picturing a llama

29:44.320 --> 29:46.560
jumping up and down on a coyote.

29:46.560 --> 29:48.240
Okay, but a coyote can jump.

29:48.240 --> 29:50.000
I do want to just get that out there.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.480
They have feet and like leg strength and shit.

29:52.480 --> 29:54.160
But which one do you think could jump better?

29:54.880 --> 29:55.920
Let me ask you a question, Travis.

29:55.920 --> 29:59.440
What would be your least favorite place to be bitten by a coyote?

29:59.440 --> 30:00.400
On the balls.

30:00.400 --> 30:01.200
Don't say the hog.

30:02.240 --> 30:02.960
Well, too late.

30:02.960 --> 30:04.800
Wait, the butt?

30:04.800 --> 30:06.160
I'll let it to make it sound like I said,

30:06.160 --> 30:08.720
don't say the hog before you mentioned the crass thing.

30:08.720 --> 30:09.200
The butt.

30:10.320 --> 30:11.280
Really, your butt?

30:11.280 --> 30:13.680
If a coyote bit me directly on the butthole.

30:13.680 --> 30:14.080
Okay.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.640
I would absolutely much prefer that I got bitten on the butt

30:16.640 --> 30:18.160
than pretty much anywhere else.

30:18.160 --> 30:19.920
Yeah, because you got a lot of butt.

30:19.920 --> 30:22.000
Yeah, I could like that, let that go.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.840
Travis is the bony butt boy though.

30:23.840 --> 30:26.800
So if his butt gets bitten, it's like, oof.

30:26.800 --> 30:28.080
He's breaking that thing off.

30:28.080 --> 30:31.600
Yeah, I have lots of, which might be a little trap, right?

30:31.600 --> 30:34.000
Like when a bird tries to get a lizard, gets that tail,

30:34.000 --> 30:35.920
lizard's like, snip, no tail, fuck you, bye.

30:36.720 --> 30:38.160
My butt will grow back.

30:38.160 --> 30:38.880
That's true.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.240
Okay, my point was this.

30:40.240 --> 30:42.240
It's my favorite Celine Dion song, by the way.

30:44.480 --> 30:50.000
My point is if you get a good one on the neck, boy, that's just it.

30:50.960 --> 30:53.840
If you get, oh boy, the neck, that's just it, isn't it?

30:53.840 --> 30:55.840
And a llama, what does a llama have a lot of?

30:55.840 --> 30:59.120
What did God, when he was sketching them out,

30:59.120 --> 31:00.960
when he was whiteboarding the old llama,

31:00.960 --> 31:03.200
he was like, let's give him like 10 times as much neck

31:03.200 --> 31:04.320
as anything would ever need.

31:04.320 --> 31:06.320
That would be a bad matchup, I think.

31:06.320 --> 31:08.800
Because again, to go back to the Pokemon terminology,

31:10.080 --> 31:14.160
biting type is very, very super effective against neck type.

31:15.280 --> 31:18.000
Do you think if you're trying to protect your flock of llamas,

31:18.000 --> 31:19.120
you put a giraffe in there?

31:19.760 --> 31:21.440
That would fuck me up, are you kidding?

31:21.440 --> 31:23.680
That would fuck me, human, like I don't go around

31:23.680 --> 31:25.120
murdering sheep all the time.

31:25.120 --> 31:26.800
That would still fuck me up.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.880
I would still see that, I would see that site and be like,

31:28.880 --> 31:30.880
I am not fucking with those sheep today.

31:30.880 --> 31:32.240
And that would be like, why would I?

31:32.240 --> 31:33.840
But definitely not gonna do it now.

31:35.440 --> 31:37.280
Could I take a sheep in a fair fight?

31:37.280 --> 31:39.200
Okay, we're done here.

31:39.200 --> 31:41.760
Well, not done, but we do need to stop for a second

31:41.760 --> 31:44.480
to talk about the Maximum Fun Network.

31:44.480 --> 31:47.280
Travis, you're in Los Angeles right now, right?

31:47.280 --> 31:47.920
That is correct.

31:47.920 --> 31:49.680
Do you just feel the excitement?

31:49.680 --> 31:51.920
Do you feel the energy of this pulsating

31:51.920 --> 31:54.160
towards the MacArthur Park area right now?

31:54.160 --> 31:57.680
I can say I've been to Max Fun HQ twice in the past week.

31:57.680 --> 32:02.880
I've recorded with three different Max Fun hosts this week.

32:02.880 --> 32:05.840
And the energy is palpable, Justin.

32:05.840 --> 32:08.080
The magic is air present.

32:08.080 --> 32:12.560
Yesterday, I was just doing my jumps to practice.

32:12.560 --> 32:14.880
Mm-hmm, full of fights.

32:14.880 --> 32:19.920
And I jumped eight feet straight up into the air.

32:19.920 --> 32:22.080
And it wasn't even like the hardest I could jump.

32:22.080 --> 32:23.040
I got scared after I did it,

32:23.040 --> 32:24.800
because when I fell, I actually did hurt myself.

32:24.800 --> 32:26.320
But like, I think I could have even gone

32:26.320 --> 32:27.600
a little bit higher up.

32:27.600 --> 32:28.960
My dream, thank you for asking,

32:28.960 --> 32:31.120
is to be able to just jump on top of my house.

32:31.120 --> 32:34.960
Is that eight feet from ground to the bottom of your feet?

32:34.960 --> 32:35.440
Yeah.

32:35.440 --> 32:37.120
Or eight feet from ground to the top of your head?

32:37.120 --> 32:37.920
Sea level.

32:37.920 --> 32:38.720
Oh, okay.

32:40.720 --> 32:43.520
I'm saying the Maximum Fun Drive gave me jumping energy.

32:43.520 --> 32:44.000
Thank you.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.600
Oh, okay, great, great, great.

32:45.600 --> 32:48.480
I knew that little digression would have a point.

32:48.480 --> 32:49.760
I thought it would.

32:49.760 --> 32:51.920
Also, if we're getting stuff off our chest,

32:51.920 --> 32:54.080
I wanted to brag about a good jump I had.

32:54.080 --> 32:55.120
I appreciate that.

32:55.120 --> 32:57.040
I appreciate that brag formation.

32:58.160 --> 33:00.960
The Maximum Fun is a podcast network

33:00.960 --> 33:03.760
we've been very proud to be a part of since 2011.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.040
That's about a year after we started doing this show

33:07.040 --> 33:11.920
way, way back, almost six years ago, in April of 2010.

33:12.560 --> 33:17.760
But Maximum Fun has a ton of great shows that we don't make.

33:17.760 --> 33:19.120
In fact, those are the good ones

33:19.120 --> 33:21.120
that you should be listening to right now.

33:21.120 --> 33:23.680
Like The Flophouse, Jordan Jesse Goh, Bullseye,

33:23.680 --> 33:26.640
Judge John Hodgman, Stop Podcasting Yourself,

33:27.600 --> 33:28.560
Throwing Shade.

33:28.560 --> 33:29.120
I could go on.

33:29.120 --> 33:30.720
There's a ton of great programs.

33:30.720 --> 33:35.120
And your donation is what helps keep the doors open.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.720
We ask people who listen to the show and like the show.

33:38.720 --> 33:39.680
We don't charge for them.

33:39.680 --> 33:41.120
Instead, we just say, hey, if you like this,

33:41.120 --> 33:42.080
could you help us make it?

33:42.080 --> 33:42.960
That's what we're really saying.

33:42.960 --> 33:47.600
So we ask you to pledge a certain amount of money per month

33:47.600 --> 33:50.560
that you can afford and that you feel is right

33:50.560 --> 33:53.760
for the amount of shows that you enjoy.

33:53.760 --> 33:56.560
So just to like break things down

33:56.560 --> 33:58.080
before we get into the gifts and levels.

33:58.640 --> 34:01.440
Just to break things down, since we've been on the network,

34:01.440 --> 34:02.720
the support that we've gotten from you all

34:02.720 --> 34:06.000
has allowed us to buy all new recording equipment,

34:07.440 --> 34:09.200
upgrading from the rock band microphones

34:09.200 --> 34:10.080
that we started out with.

34:10.080 --> 34:13.840
It has funded some tours that we've done,

34:13.840 --> 34:15.920
the travel and booking of those places.

34:17.520 --> 34:18.400
It's helped out with that.

34:18.400 --> 34:20.880
We did what, like 15 live shows

34:20.880 --> 34:21.840
or something like that last year?

34:21.840 --> 34:22.800
That wouldn't have been possible

34:22.800 --> 34:24.800
without Max Fund Drive and donor support.

34:25.840 --> 34:28.160
We've launched a ton of new podcasts.

34:28.160 --> 34:30.160
Travis, this is his full-time job now

34:30.160 --> 34:31.920
because of the support that we get.

34:31.920 --> 34:34.960
So things like the Adventure Zone would not exist

34:34.960 --> 34:39.120
if it was not for the support we get from donors.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.600
So there's an absolutely like a tangible,

34:42.160 --> 34:43.360
I guess if you wanna think about it,

34:43.360 --> 34:46.000
like return on your investment if you like the stuff we do.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.920
Why don't we talk a little bit about gifts?

34:47.920 --> 34:51.200
Because you're not buying stuff.

34:51.200 --> 34:52.880
Justin, it's pronounced jiff.

34:52.880 --> 34:54.480
It's pronounced jifts.

34:55.200 --> 34:56.320
Let's talk about the jifts.

34:57.040 --> 34:58.800
If you can pledge five bucks a month,

34:58.800 --> 35:03.040
which is the price of a very cheap cup of coffee every day

35:03.040 --> 35:06.800
or one decently priced cup of coffee once a month,

35:07.760 --> 35:09.120
if you get like a lot of additives

35:09.120 --> 35:10.160
and it's a large size.

35:10.160 --> 35:13.440
Like an 18 cent cup of dirty fucking shit.

35:13.440 --> 35:14.800
Well, they always say that like

35:14.800 --> 35:16.160
for the price of a cup of coffee,

35:16.160 --> 35:17.760
you can feel like you can't.

35:17.760 --> 35:19.280
Like I don't know where you're getting this very,

35:19.280 --> 35:20.960
this 18 cent coffee, but anyway.

35:20.960 --> 35:22.720
You're going to like a greasy spoon.

35:22.720 --> 35:25.280
You're sitting along some other Depression era folks.

35:25.280 --> 35:28.480
And you're just like scooping like water out of a toilet

35:28.480 --> 35:31.120
and like pouring it on grounds that were thrown away yesterday.

35:31.120 --> 35:32.560
It's about 18 cents.

35:32.560 --> 35:33.840
If you can pledge $5 a month,

35:34.560 --> 35:38.000
you're going to get the access code

35:38.000 --> 35:41.920
to a veritable treasure trove of bonus material.

35:43.040 --> 35:46.800
You're gonna get like just my brother and my brother and me.

35:46.800 --> 35:51.680
There's tons of shows on there

35:51.680 --> 35:54.240
that have put up bonus episodes for years

35:54.240 --> 35:55.760
and you're gonna get all of it.

35:55.760 --> 35:58.320
There's literally days of content on there.

35:58.320 --> 36:00.480
But just if we're just talking about

36:00.480 --> 36:01.440
my brother, my brother and me,

36:01.440 --> 36:03.760
just to give you an example of what we're talking about,

36:03.760 --> 36:09.920
you're going to get one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

36:09.920 --> 36:12.640
eight episodes of the show you've never heard before.

36:12.640 --> 36:15.520
Bonus episodes, all of which have like weird.

36:15.520 --> 36:16.800
What are those?

36:16.800 --> 36:18.080
I can't even remember what we've done.

36:18.080 --> 36:19.040
Like this year we did.

36:19.040 --> 36:20.160
The one with our dad.

36:20.160 --> 36:24.000
We did, there's a, not counted in that total,

36:24.000 --> 36:26.080
but my sister, my sister and me,

36:26.080 --> 36:30.560
which is our wives recorded a podcast together.

36:30.560 --> 36:31.280
That's on there.

36:32.160 --> 36:35.040
Big Gulp Live, the one and only episode

36:35.040 --> 36:36.640
of Griffin's Vore podcast.

36:36.640 --> 36:38.800
Big Gulp is there.

36:38.800 --> 36:39.920
Holy shit.

36:39.920 --> 36:41.360
Yeah, that's there.

36:41.360 --> 36:45.440
Our friend, Lin-Manuel Miranda, the guy,

36:45.440 --> 36:47.040
he's been on TV a couple of times.

36:47.040 --> 36:47.920
I'm not sure what for,

36:47.920 --> 36:50.000
but he seems to be making a name for himself.

36:50.880 --> 36:53.680
He's got a demo of a song called Ghost Horse

36:54.320 --> 36:55.680
that he wrote for us.

36:55.680 --> 36:58.320
And the demo of him recording it is on there.

36:58.960 --> 37:00.240
The Ghost Horse demo.

37:00.240 --> 37:02.320
Fugue for Brother Horns is the subtitle of that.

37:02.320 --> 37:03.120
But that's on there.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.360
Like there's a ton of crap on there.

37:07.360 --> 37:08.800
Including some video stuff.

37:08.800 --> 37:09.440
Some videos.

37:09.440 --> 37:12.480
Yeah, we riffed some old training.

37:12.480 --> 37:14.720
Not training, but educational films.

37:15.520 --> 37:16.080
Short films.

37:16.080 --> 37:18.320
We did some jokes about those.

37:18.320 --> 37:20.160
And that's on there.

37:20.160 --> 37:21.280
And that's like just our show.

37:21.280 --> 37:23.120
There's tons and tons and tons of crap.

37:23.120 --> 37:26.320
We did a show about ASMR for my medical history podcast,

37:26.320 --> 37:30.640
Sawbones, which ends in a binaural holophonic

37:30.640 --> 37:32.880
virtual doctor's office visit

37:32.880 --> 37:35.200
that demonstrates the idea of ASMR.

37:36.000 --> 37:36.960
And that's on there.

37:36.960 --> 37:39.920
There's so much on there that you can be enjoying

37:39.920 --> 37:41.200
if you just donate $5 a month.

37:41.200 --> 37:42.720
That's just five bucks a month

37:42.720 --> 37:45.520
if you go to maximumfun.org slash donate right now.

37:45.520 --> 37:48.320
For $10 a month, you get all that bonus content

37:48.320 --> 37:51.680
and you get your pick of one of, I believe, 22,

37:51.680 --> 37:54.240
maybe 24, somewhere in there, bandanas.

37:54.240 --> 37:58.400
Each one styled for a specific show on the network.

37:58.400 --> 37:59.840
The My Brother, My Brother and Me one

37:59.840 --> 38:01.440
features Torsey the Torso Horse

38:01.440 --> 38:03.280
along with a lot of other awesome stuff.

38:03.280 --> 38:06.880
You can find them at maximumfun.org forward slash bandanas.

38:06.880 --> 38:08.400
And that's just $10 a month.

38:09.600 --> 38:11.040
It's a really awesome deal.

38:11.680 --> 38:14.800
And you're gonna look super cool in that bandana.

38:14.800 --> 38:17.920
You're gonna look like a tough bike man or woman.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.440
Like a biker mouse from Mars.

38:20.080 --> 38:21.680
Now at $20 a month,

38:21.680 --> 38:24.880
you are going to get the Max Fun Adventure Necessity Collection.

38:24.880 --> 38:25.760
This is, hey, what?

38:25.760 --> 38:26.880
You go camping, what?

38:26.880 --> 38:28.640
You get lost, just you get lost

38:28.640 --> 38:29.920
and you wander into the woods sometimes

38:29.920 --> 38:31.360
and you have to survive a night out there.

38:31.360 --> 38:33.600
The Max Fun Adventure Necessity Collection's got you.

38:33.600 --> 38:36.400
It's got a multi-tool with the Max Fun Rocket logo on it.

38:36.400 --> 38:38.080
It's got a hot chocolate packet.

38:38.080 --> 38:39.840
Actually, if you're like surviving out in the wilderness,

38:39.840 --> 38:41.440
that probably would be low on the,

38:41.440 --> 38:42.080
although I don't know,

38:42.080 --> 38:43.760
that sugar would probably give you the burst of energy

38:43.760 --> 38:46.240
and you need to like fashion a hut out of a tree.

38:47.600 --> 38:49.440
A paracord bracelet you can use,

38:49.440 --> 38:51.120
I think turns into a rope or something.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.400
There's camping toilet paper,

38:52.400 --> 38:54.800
which would absolutely be my number one necessity.

38:55.680 --> 38:56.560
I poop a lot.

38:57.840 --> 38:59.760
Anyway, you can get that at $20 a month,

38:59.760 --> 39:01.200
but you also get the stuff before.

39:01.200 --> 39:02.960
Like the bandana and the bonus episodes.

39:02.960 --> 39:05.520
Not like, that's specifically the stuff you'll get.

39:05.520 --> 39:08.160
But what you also get is the smug satisfaction

39:08.160 --> 39:09.360
of knowing that you donated

39:09.360 --> 39:10.800
to support the things that you love.

39:10.800 --> 39:13.600
And we also understand that not everybody can do that.

39:13.600 --> 39:15.040
Sometimes you find yourself in a position

39:15.040 --> 39:17.120
where you can't afford to give money every month.

39:17.120 --> 39:18.000
And we totally get that.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.840
If that's the case, make sure you go on Twitter,

39:19.840 --> 39:20.560
you go on Facebook,

39:20.560 --> 39:22.960
you tell your friends that Max Fun Drive is going on.

39:22.960 --> 39:26.000
You share that link, maximumfun.org forward slash donate

39:26.000 --> 39:27.360
and you say like, I can't,

39:27.360 --> 39:29.680
but you should support the things you love,

39:29.680 --> 39:31.600
maximumfun.org forward slash donate.

39:32.320 --> 39:35.520
We'll talk more about what else you can get

39:35.520 --> 39:38.800
in the Max Fun Drive and how you can help support us.

39:38.800 --> 39:42.240
But I think we should get back into the fucking flow.

39:43.280 --> 39:44.720
Yeah, dive in.

39:44.720 --> 39:46.160
All right, here's another question.

39:46.160 --> 39:48.800
This one comes to us from Gmail.

39:49.600 --> 39:51.120
It says, one of my closest friends

39:51.120 --> 39:53.840
has recently gone a bit off the deep end.

39:54.480 --> 39:57.120
The past few years, he's spent a lot of time on the internet

39:57.120 --> 39:58.720
watching conspiracy theory videos

39:58.720 --> 40:00.240
and YouTube documentaries.

40:00.240 --> 40:02.560
Usually when he starts into some weird Illuminati talk,

40:02.560 --> 40:04.240
I could change the subject to something more normal,

40:04.240 --> 40:04.880
but not today.

40:05.440 --> 40:07.680
We're stuck in a car together for a solid half hour

40:07.680 --> 40:09.200
during which he expounded upon a variety

40:09.200 --> 40:11.360
of crazy government slash occult theories.

40:11.360 --> 40:14.160
I realized that he was spending way more time on this stuff

40:14.160 --> 40:16.880
than I thought he even got pretty worked up

40:16.880 --> 40:17.680
at a couple of points.

40:18.240 --> 40:21.760
How can I talk to him about toning it way, way down?

40:21.760 --> 40:23.360
My fear is there's a point of no return.

40:23.360 --> 40:24.480
He may be fast approaching.

40:25.120 --> 40:26.000
What should I do?

40:26.000 --> 40:29.280
It says Gmail here, but it sounds to me

40:29.280 --> 40:31.360
like this is actually from the G-man.

40:31.360 --> 40:32.960
The G-man?

40:32.960 --> 40:34.320
Yeah, open your eyes.

40:34.320 --> 40:37.920
Back in the old, the fucking data vault,

40:37.920 --> 40:41.440
the old black crypt and put it back buried underground

40:41.440 --> 40:44.720
for the lizard men to feast.

40:46.640 --> 40:48.400
Lizard men feast on truth.

40:48.400 --> 40:50.080
And if you bury truth underground,

40:50.080 --> 40:52.400
that's how the lizard men get to it and they can eat it.

40:52.400 --> 40:53.200
That's true.

40:53.200 --> 40:55.760
There's one way, Griffin, Griffin, how do I stop?

40:55.760 --> 40:56.880
How do I fight the lizard men?

40:57.440 --> 40:58.480
I'm glad you asked.

40:58.480 --> 41:02.800
Gold, you need it, you need it, you need it.

41:02.800 --> 41:03.920
You need it, go get it.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.200
Oh, go get that gold.

41:05.200 --> 41:07.040
Oh my God, you need the gold.

41:07.040 --> 41:08.560
It's so very important.

41:08.560 --> 41:11.120
Also, if you put a llama in with your sheeple,

41:11.120 --> 41:12.960
it'll protect them from the lizard men.

41:12.960 --> 41:14.320
That's a hundred percent true,

41:14.320 --> 41:17.040
but not everybody's gonna have that luxury

41:17.040 --> 41:19.200
because llamas are a rarity.

41:19.200 --> 41:21.680
You gotta get a llama and a human being to bone down

41:21.680 --> 41:23.520
and then that's a tough-

41:23.520 --> 41:25.680
That's how Lorenzo Lamas was born.

41:25.680 --> 41:27.440
Jesus, that's a good joke, Travis.

41:27.440 --> 41:28.240
Thank you, Griffin.

41:28.880 --> 41:32.240
I literally got sweaty from how good the joke was.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.520
I got chills like for days.

41:34.080 --> 41:35.680
A lot of people laugh when they hear a good joke.

41:35.680 --> 41:37.360
For me, it was like instant sweat.

41:40.560 --> 41:42.560
The laughs came through your pores.

41:42.560 --> 41:44.560
Yeah, in the form of perspiration.

41:44.560 --> 41:47.520
Anyway, gold, oh my God, you need it.

41:47.520 --> 41:48.640
Lizard men are afraid of it.

41:50.560 --> 41:52.960
It's the worst thing about conspiracy theorists

41:52.960 --> 41:57.120
is that they've made pirates seem like conspiracy theorists themselves.

41:57.120 --> 41:59.280
Because every time they open up a chest full of gold,

41:59.280 --> 42:00.560
they're like, oh, thank goodness.

42:00.560 --> 42:01.120
It's like-

42:01.120 --> 42:01.760
Oh, fuck yeah.

42:02.800 --> 42:04.080
Yeah, we're safe.

42:04.080 --> 42:05.840
Come take this, Obama.

42:05.840 --> 42:06.160
Just kidding.

42:06.160 --> 42:08.400
Hey guys, can we encrypt this somehow?

42:08.400 --> 42:09.840
I don't know what that means because I'm a pirate,

42:09.840 --> 42:11.280
but we'll figure it out.

42:11.840 --> 42:14.960
Like a pirate who's a big fan of national treasure.

42:14.960 --> 42:17.040
I mean, for a pirate, if you bury treasure,

42:17.040 --> 42:18.800
that's encrypting it, technically.

42:18.800 --> 42:20.000
I mean, that's true.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.600
It's hard to hack a treasure chest.

42:21.600 --> 42:22.400
Yeah.

42:22.400 --> 42:23.520
I got another question.

42:23.520 --> 42:25.360
Well, no, well, we didn't even help that person.

42:25.360 --> 42:26.160
Yeah, so what?

42:26.160 --> 42:26.720
I got another question.

42:26.720 --> 42:28.320
Okay, open your eyes.

42:28.320 --> 42:29.520
Your friend is right.

42:29.520 --> 42:30.080
Open your eyes.

42:30.080 --> 42:31.520
Your friend is not right.

42:32.080 --> 42:34.400
Obviously, this is the way that their anxiety manifests.

42:35.600 --> 42:37.120
You should ask, you should talk.

42:37.120 --> 42:40.320
They should, don't try to, here's your real advice, okay?

42:40.320 --> 42:41.360
Your real advice.

42:41.360 --> 42:44.880
Don't try to talk a person like this out of conspiracy theories

42:44.880 --> 42:47.200
that is reinforcing their conspiracy theory.

42:47.200 --> 42:48.400
Trust me on this one.

42:48.400 --> 42:51.200
This is beyond both our and their pay grade.

42:51.200 --> 42:52.320
And if you want to help them out,

42:52.320 --> 42:55.520
then get them to talk to somebody who it is their pay grade.

42:56.080 --> 42:57.600
Yeah, that ain't ours.

42:57.600 --> 42:59.600
My best friend treats me like I'm her baby daddy.

42:59.600 --> 43:00.800
Now we're talking.

43:00.800 --> 43:02.480
She even went as far as to tell some of the people

43:02.480 --> 43:05.600
who asked who the father was while she was pregnant

43:05.600 --> 43:06.480
that it was me.

43:06.480 --> 43:06.720
Wait, what?

43:06.720 --> 43:08.240
This is biologically impossible

43:08.240 --> 43:11.040
as we have never slept together and I, like her, am a woman.

43:11.040 --> 43:13.200
It stopped being cute and funny around the fifth time

43:13.200 --> 43:13.760
she said it.

43:13.760 --> 43:15.440
I don't even want kids my own.

43:15.440 --> 43:19.120
How do I get her to stop stamping my name on that belly button?

43:19.120 --> 43:20.320
And that's from Jenna.

43:20.320 --> 43:21.280
Like Jenna.

43:21.280 --> 43:21.780
What?

43:22.160 --> 43:22.660
Jenna.

43:23.280 --> 43:23.780
What?

43:24.160 --> 43:24.660
Jenna.

43:25.840 --> 43:27.040
Just tell her to stop.

43:27.600 --> 43:29.840
Jenna, this is a grounder.

43:30.560 --> 43:31.760
Tell her to quit doing that.

43:32.640 --> 43:37.520
But now, is there anybody who honestly thinks that this is-

43:37.520 --> 43:38.480
Oh, that are fooled?

43:39.520 --> 43:40.020
Yeah.

43:41.680 --> 43:42.180
Huh.

43:42.880 --> 43:46.160
I'm actually sitting here thinking, two women?

43:47.120 --> 43:48.080
I mean, we are-

43:48.080 --> 43:49.680
They're actually working on that technology.

43:49.680 --> 43:51.440
Yeah, like we're getting close to that technology.

43:51.440 --> 43:53.280
No, I know, but we're not there yet.

43:53.280 --> 43:53.760
Yeah.

43:53.760 --> 43:57.120
But I tell you what though, I'm not so plugged in

43:57.840 --> 44:00.480
that if someone told me that like I'm so embarrassed,

44:00.480 --> 44:01.760
I'm so like terrified.

44:01.760 --> 44:02.640
Oh, yes.

44:02.640 --> 44:03.760
Seeming like out of it.

44:03.760 --> 44:06.400
I'd be like, yeah, I've heard a lot about that lately.

44:06.400 --> 44:07.200
That tracks.

44:07.200 --> 44:08.160
That tracks with me.

44:08.160 --> 44:08.880
They would say that.

44:08.880 --> 44:11.040
The nightmare scenario that Justin's proposing is

44:11.040 --> 44:14.720
they would say that to, let's just use us as an example.

44:14.720 --> 44:17.280
And I would say, I would go, good one.

44:17.280 --> 44:18.880
And they'd be like, no, they took my stem cells

44:18.880 --> 44:21.600
and her stem cells and just like did the hokey pokey.

44:21.600 --> 44:25.040
And then like, wow, this is meet Marcia.

44:25.040 --> 44:26.720
And like, oh fuck, I fucked up.

44:26.720 --> 44:27.360
I'm so sorry.

44:27.360 --> 44:28.160
Your love is beautiful.

44:28.160 --> 44:28.800
I didn't mean to laugh.

44:28.800 --> 44:30.960
It's just like, I thought it was, oh, I'm so sorry.

44:32.560 --> 44:34.400
And then they double back on the goof and they're like,

44:34.400 --> 44:35.040
no, I'm just kidding.

44:35.040 --> 44:36.240
We don't have that tech yet.

44:36.240 --> 44:39.120
And I'm like, oh fuck, I'm really sweating over here.

44:39.760 --> 44:41.040
The whole time I knew it.

44:41.040 --> 44:42.400
But you know what, here's what it is.

44:42.400 --> 44:44.240
This is what I think this is a matter of.

44:44.240 --> 44:46.560
Your friend probably did this goof once

44:46.560 --> 44:49.600
and like people laughed and maybe you kind of laughed too.

44:49.600 --> 44:51.200
And then she was like, oh, okay.

44:51.200 --> 44:53.200
This is a good response joke.

44:53.200 --> 44:55.600
When someone asks like, who's the, you know,

44:55.600 --> 44:56.400
like who's the father?

44:56.400 --> 44:59.040
Which is also a weird thing to ask anybody.

44:59.040 --> 45:01.200
That's a weird thing to ask anybody.

45:02.240 --> 45:03.920
Oh yeah, who's the father?

45:03.920 --> 45:05.360
Why, what the fuck?

45:05.360 --> 45:05.840
Fuck you.

45:07.040 --> 45:08.320
Hey, who'd you bone?

45:09.680 --> 45:10.640
Who put that in you?

45:11.520 --> 45:12.720
Hey, who'd you bone today?

45:13.840 --> 45:15.440
That's a weird thing.

45:15.440 --> 45:16.720
I think that's the bigger problem.

45:16.720 --> 45:18.160
How often is this coming up?

45:18.800 --> 45:20.480
Or is she volunteering this?

45:20.480 --> 45:22.240
Like she walks into a party and she's like,

45:22.240 --> 45:24.160
my friend Jenna put this baby in me.

45:25.040 --> 45:25.920
That's also weird.

45:25.920 --> 45:26.880
It's a weird opener.

45:28.320 --> 45:29.680
It's not as bad as mine.

45:29.680 --> 45:31.680
I just walk in with my phone up like,

45:31.680 --> 45:33.440
have you guys seen this damn Daniel kid?

45:33.440 --> 45:34.160
What's up with that?

45:34.800 --> 45:35.840
That's good.

45:35.840 --> 45:36.800
It's pretty good, I think,

45:36.800 --> 45:38.960
because it connects with everybody, you know?

45:38.960 --> 45:40.960
And it'll never not be topical.

45:42.160 --> 45:43.200
Can I read a Yahoo?

45:44.000 --> 45:44.960
Yeah, sure.

45:44.960 --> 45:45.760
Kind of a classic bit.

45:45.760 --> 45:48.400
This one's sent in by riding high Zoe Kinski.

45:48.400 --> 45:48.880
Thank you, Zoe.

45:48.880 --> 45:51.360
It's by Yahoo Answers user shall cat who asks.

45:52.480 --> 45:54.800
Taller wife is blessing or curse.

45:58.800 --> 45:59.760
You know how they have like,

46:02.320 --> 46:05.920
like quotation marks is and then,

46:05.920 --> 46:07.840
but they also have like single quotation marks

46:07.840 --> 46:08.640
and describing height.

46:08.640 --> 46:09.280
Which one's foot?

46:09.280 --> 46:10.000
Which one's inch?

46:10.960 --> 46:12.560
One is foot, two is inch.

46:12.560 --> 46:13.040
Okay.

46:13.040 --> 46:14.960
My wife is three is meters.

46:14.960 --> 46:15.280
Okay.

46:15.280 --> 46:17.120
My wife is three feet taller than me.

46:19.360 --> 46:22.480
I've become a divided man in privacy.

46:22.480 --> 46:25.600
I am a staunch admirer and lover of my taller wife.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.600
I love, let me fucking finish.

46:30.880 --> 46:32.480
I enjoy her height,

46:32.480 --> 46:35.600
dominance of her physique and her overall supremacy.

46:35.600 --> 46:37.600
While in public, I am a scared man,

46:38.320 --> 46:41.440
feeling myself overwhelmed and pressurized.

46:41.440 --> 46:43.440
Please provide me some genuine solution.

46:45.520 --> 46:46.400
Being pressurized is great.

46:46.400 --> 46:47.600
Cause if it starts raining on you,

46:47.600 --> 46:48.960
like you don't even have to worry about it.

46:49.600 --> 46:54.480
The difference is in the answer to this question.

46:55.840 --> 47:00.640
Dependent on whether he meant to type one apostrophe mark

47:01.200 --> 47:03.520
or two are an ocean.

47:03.520 --> 47:04.960
They are a vast ocean.

47:04.960 --> 47:06.080
It's a gulf.

47:06.080 --> 47:07.680
Separating two continents.

47:07.680 --> 47:11.280
Let's assume, how can we, how can we talk about the,

47:11.280 --> 47:18.480
are we talking like a Danny DeVito, Rhea Perlman situation?

47:18.480 --> 47:18.960
Or-

47:18.960 --> 47:21.360
You mean Danny DeVito with two Rhea Perlman's

47:21.360 --> 47:23.760
standing on top of each other's shoulders situation.

47:23.760 --> 47:28.960
The average male American height is five foot 10 inches tall.

47:28.960 --> 47:29.360
Okay.

47:29.360 --> 47:30.960
I say we start there.

47:30.960 --> 47:33.520
The average person-

47:33.520 --> 47:35.440
All right, let's take a foot and a half off that, four, four.

47:35.440 --> 47:38.000
We'll say four, four, and then we'll do,

47:38.000 --> 47:40.320
we'll add the three feet on the other end.

47:40.320 --> 47:40.960
For what are women?

47:40.960 --> 47:41.760
Like five, six?

47:43.600 --> 47:45.360
So a good six, 10.

47:45.360 --> 47:46.800
Four, four and six, 10.

47:46.800 --> 47:48.880
That doesn't add, does that track?

47:48.880 --> 47:49.120
No.

47:49.120 --> 47:50.080
Doesn't track do it.

47:50.960 --> 47:52.400
Four, four and seven, four.

47:56.160 --> 47:58.720
The tallest woman held the,

47:58.720 --> 48:01.840
according to Guinness Book of World Records, seven foot five.

48:01.840 --> 48:02.400
Okay.

48:02.400 --> 48:03.840
All right, so he's not a record,

48:03.840 --> 48:07.440
he's not a record breaking or like record encroaching.

48:07.440 --> 48:08.160
No, that's what I'm saying.

48:08.160 --> 48:09.760
Seven, four and four, four.

48:09.760 --> 48:11.120
That's what we're talking about.

48:11.120 --> 48:14.160
Run her up for my very tall wife.

48:14.960 --> 48:16.240
Oh wait, sorry.

48:16.240 --> 48:20.480
The actual, the tallest is eight foot one and three quarters inches.

48:20.480 --> 48:20.800
All right, so let's-

48:20.800 --> 48:23.360
She's not even really that tall at seven, four.

48:23.360 --> 48:24.000
Yeah.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.120
All right, seven, four and four, four.

48:25.120 --> 48:25.840
That's what we're talking about.

48:26.400 --> 48:27.520
I enjoy my tall wife.

48:27.520 --> 48:33.200
I enjoy my very big spouse so much.

48:34.080 --> 48:35.600
I love my big wife, guys.

48:35.600 --> 48:37.040
I don't know what to tell you.

48:37.040 --> 48:38.000
I'm not ashamed of it,

48:38.000 --> 48:40.080
except when we're in public, I feel like a scared man.

48:40.080 --> 48:42.240
I feel pressurized.

48:42.240 --> 48:44.720
But Danny DeVito is five feet tall.

48:44.720 --> 48:45.440
Correct.

48:45.440 --> 48:46.160
So you're four, four.

48:46.160 --> 48:47.920
And Rhea Perlman's five feet tall.

48:48.880 --> 48:50.080
That's amazing.

48:50.080 --> 48:51.280
I love these two.

48:51.280 --> 48:52.560
That makes me so happy.

48:52.560 --> 48:54.000
My wife is three feet tall.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.040
I love my big wife.

48:55.040 --> 48:55.840
Please, what do I do?

48:55.840 --> 49:00.000
In public, I get so scared and pressurized and overwhelmed.

49:00.000 --> 49:03.840
I mean, she's so much taller than him is the only thing about it.

49:05.600 --> 49:08.640
Should we assume, would we be more easily equipped to handle this

49:08.640 --> 49:10.480
if she was three inches taller?

49:10.480 --> 49:12.960
Because God, that seems just like so much more likely.

49:14.240 --> 49:19.040
That doesn't seem like worth writing into your answer about that, does it?

49:19.840 --> 49:21.600
That's like not that impressive.

49:22.800 --> 49:25.280
I mean, do they feel like they have to explain

49:25.280 --> 49:28.880
to people, to passersby, I love my very big wife.

49:30.240 --> 49:32.560
And I like her.

49:32.560 --> 49:36.720
If people are like, wow, is it hard having that three foot divide?

49:37.280 --> 49:38.640
And you would have to explain like every time,

49:38.640 --> 49:41.040
like I enjoy the dominance of her physique.

49:41.040 --> 49:43.040
But I do not like being pressurized.

49:43.600 --> 49:44.800
Well, that's just a public thing.

49:44.800 --> 49:47.520
That's just like, he's worried what the public thinks about them.

49:48.400 --> 49:50.240
Maybe he's less worried about what the public thinks

49:50.240 --> 49:54.320
and more worried about those two eyes he has glowering down on him

49:54.320 --> 49:57.520
from above every time someone gives them dirt looks.

49:58.400 --> 50:02.720
It's like, oh, listen, I see what you're thinking there.

50:02.720 --> 50:04.800
And I love my tall wife.

50:04.800 --> 50:05.920
I love my very big wife.

50:05.920 --> 50:06.320
I don't know what-

50:07.120 --> 50:09.280
It's gonna be really embarrassing when he finds out his wife

50:09.280 --> 50:12.720
is just two wives stacked on top of each other in a big trench coat.

50:12.720 --> 50:12.960
Yeah.

50:13.760 --> 50:17.200
And when she finds out that he's actually, he's actually eight rabbits.

50:20.480 --> 50:22.880
The whole time he's been one Tim Conway on his knees

50:22.880 --> 50:24.320
with fake shoes in front of his knees.

50:24.320 --> 50:24.960
Absolutely.

50:25.840 --> 50:26.880
I love my big wife.

50:28.400 --> 50:30.720
I don't think there's any grounds for discussion,

50:30.720 --> 50:31.680
further discussion here.

50:31.680 --> 50:34.240
I'm happy to put this one to rest.

50:34.240 --> 50:35.200
It's just guys.

50:36.080 --> 50:38.000
My wife is tall and I love that in her.

50:38.720 --> 50:39.920
I love my big wife.

50:39.920 --> 50:41.360
I'm a man divided.

50:42.720 --> 50:44.080
At the end of each workday,

50:44.080 --> 50:46.800
my husband and I arrive at the entrance of our apartment complex

50:46.800 --> 50:49.360
to check out our mailbox before heading back in.

50:49.360 --> 50:50.480
For the past three weeks,

50:50.480 --> 50:53.280
light clockwork at white haired elderly gentleman

50:53.280 --> 50:56.320
around the age 75 to 80 exits the mailroom

50:56.320 --> 51:00.640
and literally walks backwards towards his own apartment.

51:00.640 --> 51:02.800
A good five to seven minute walk.

51:02.800 --> 51:05.920
Damn Daniel, it's a very surreal thing to watch.

51:06.480 --> 51:09.200
He always has a grimace on his face and worse,

51:09.200 --> 51:11.280
he stares right at us as he's doing it.

51:11.280 --> 51:13.360
We've been trying to figure out why he would do this.

51:13.360 --> 51:15.440
Is this a new exercise for the elderly?

51:15.440 --> 51:17.280
Are we in an episode of Twin Peaks?

51:17.280 --> 51:19.840
And most of all, why in God's name must he stare at us

51:19.840 --> 51:20.800
when he does it?

51:20.800 --> 51:22.880
Is there any chance you might be able to shed some light on this?

51:22.880 --> 51:26.320
We'd love to hear your thoughts and conclusions on this matter.

51:26.320 --> 51:27.200
That's from Alexis.

51:28.560 --> 51:29.840
He's definitely a ghost.

51:29.840 --> 51:32.000
Like a hundred percent, definitely, definitely a ghost.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.440
Like that's not even a question,

51:33.440 --> 51:35.760
which is another one of our bits that we're bringing back

51:35.760 --> 51:36.400
for Goofbusters.

51:36.400 --> 51:37.600
But just cause he's a ghost

51:37.600 --> 51:39.200
doesn't mean he's not gaslighting you.

51:39.840 --> 51:40.640
That's true.

51:40.640 --> 51:44.480
That's sometimes ghosts just need something to keep them going.

51:44.480 --> 51:44.960
For all you know,

51:44.960 --> 51:48.720
he's walked the ghostly plane for like 400 years

51:48.720 --> 51:52.320
and he's just like, I need something to keep me going.

51:52.320 --> 51:55.600
And it's messing with Alexis and her husband.

51:55.600 --> 51:59.120
The strongest argument for gaslighting, in my opinion,

51:59.120 --> 52:00.800
is the repetition.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.320
If you had seen this once and you had thought,

52:04.320 --> 52:05.520
oh, that's weird.

52:05.520 --> 52:07.120
And then you never saw it again,

52:07.120 --> 52:10.240
that could have been one of life's many coincidences.

52:10.240 --> 52:12.320
Since it has happened multiple times,

52:13.040 --> 52:15.520
he is trying to get you to question his sanity.

52:15.520 --> 52:17.120
If it happens more than once,

52:17.120 --> 52:19.040
it's you're being gaslit.

52:19.040 --> 52:21.040
Yeah, he's definitely has some sort of lizard man

52:21.760 --> 52:23.920
like surveillance situation on you.

52:23.920 --> 52:25.840
Like guaranteed if you went up to him and said,

52:25.840 --> 52:28.240
hey, didn't you just do this?

52:28.800 --> 52:31.200
He would say, no, I don't think so.

52:31.200 --> 52:33.680
I think this is the first time I've ever, ever done this.

52:33.680 --> 52:34.180
Yeah.

52:35.680 --> 52:37.680
Another possibility, can I put this forward?

52:37.680 --> 52:38.080
Hit me.

52:38.640 --> 52:40.400
What if he just has a great ass

52:41.360 --> 52:42.880
and he just always wants you to-

52:42.880 --> 52:45.040
Does he have truck nuts hanging from his belt?

52:45.040 --> 52:46.800
No, we're putting truck nuts away.

52:46.800 --> 52:47.600
Put it back in the drawer.

52:47.600 --> 52:48.320
No, I will never.

52:48.320 --> 52:48.960
I'm the teacher.

52:48.960 --> 52:50.400
I'm gonna take your fucking prank,

52:50.400 --> 52:51.760
prank you, whoopee cushions.

52:51.760 --> 52:52.640
I'm gonna take your truck nuts.

52:52.640 --> 52:54.880
I'm gonna put them in my drawer.

52:54.880 --> 52:56.320
And then later on, the principal is gonna find him

52:56.320 --> 52:59.360
and be like, Michelle, what the fuck?

53:00.160 --> 53:02.400
You can't have nuts at work.

53:02.400 --> 53:05.120
This is not your band.

53:05.760 --> 53:08.000
Anyway, maybe he's got a great,

53:08.000 --> 53:09.920
oh, just a juicy little rump.

53:09.920 --> 53:11.920
Oh, a juicy little old man bottom.

53:11.920 --> 53:13.200
And he just wants you to greet,

53:13.200 --> 53:14.000
he wants to greet you.

53:14.000 --> 53:14.800
Hello, good day.

53:14.800 --> 53:15.280
This is me.

53:15.280 --> 53:16.400
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

53:16.400 --> 53:20.240
He just wants you to see it with your eyes, first thing.

53:20.240 --> 53:22.800
Maybe learn to moonwalk is on his bucket list.

53:24.800 --> 53:25.040
It's possible.

53:25.040 --> 53:26.400
He's made it through a lot, huh?

53:27.440 --> 53:29.920
He must have turned through the first few pages already.

53:29.920 --> 53:31.360
He started way too early.

53:31.360 --> 53:33.440
He started doing his bucket list at 40,

53:34.240 --> 53:37.840
but now at 80, he's like, I'm down to the dregs.

53:37.840 --> 53:41.120
I've got eat crackers hanging from a pole

53:41.120 --> 53:42.800
and walk backwards.

53:42.800 --> 53:45.840
Do that thing with a dollar bill on a rope

53:45.840 --> 53:47.680
tied to a stick to a little kid

53:47.680 --> 53:48.960
to make him run around the block.

53:49.760 --> 53:52.160
Gaslight, gaslight some 20 somethings.

53:53.360 --> 53:54.800
Next time you see him moonwalking,

53:54.800 --> 53:56.880
just see if he's carrying like a coffee can

53:56.880 --> 53:58.800
full of the ashes of his best friend

53:58.800 --> 54:00.800
who he was knocking that list out with.

54:00.800 --> 54:02.400
Because that's a telltale sign.

54:03.200 --> 54:04.080
We didn't get this,

54:04.080 --> 54:06.080
we didn't get to this one together, Peter,

54:06.080 --> 54:08.000
but you got there.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
You're moonwalking with Jesus now.

54:10.000 --> 54:15.360
You see that one pair of backwards footprints?

54:16.240 --> 54:18.240
That's where I carried you backwards.

54:18.240 --> 54:20.240
I'm gonna throw your ass down on the floor

54:20.240 --> 54:22.000
now to reduce the friction.

54:22.960 --> 54:24.080
Thank you, Peter.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.640
Peter, your burned up body helps me dance again.

54:35.760 --> 54:38.320
Shuffle flop, shuffle step.

54:38.320 --> 54:40.000
Peter, with your dusty permission,

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
I'm gonna try to do the lean over thing.

54:42.000 --> 54:42.640
Nope, dad.

54:45.680 --> 54:47.280
Someone come burn me

54:47.280 --> 54:49.600
so I can lubricate your moonwalk.

54:49.600 --> 54:52.800
And then you can carry this burden backwards

54:52.800 --> 54:54.080
for all of time.

54:54.080 --> 54:55.760
That's what the circle of life was about.

54:56.800 --> 55:00.240
Peter, I want our bodies to do sand art together.

55:02.880 --> 55:06.480
I want a bored teenager on a boardwalk somewhere

55:06.480 --> 55:08.320
to pour us both in a jar

55:08.320 --> 55:10.560
and then poke a straw through us

55:10.560 --> 55:13.040
to make weird angular shapes, Peter.

55:13.040 --> 55:13.920
Set me free.

55:19.280 --> 55:19.760
What do we got?

55:19.760 --> 55:20.560
Another Yahoo?

55:20.560 --> 55:22.560
Or maybe we should talk about the Max Fun Drive again.

55:22.560 --> 55:24.480
I think let's talk about the Max Fun Drive one more time

55:24.480 --> 55:27.440
and then do a couple more and then bounce.

55:27.440 --> 55:32.640
Maximumfun.org relies on your donations

55:32.640 --> 55:33.760
to keep the network going

55:33.760 --> 55:36.640
and it also allows us to do other shows.

55:36.640 --> 55:38.320
When we started Maximum Fun,

55:38.320 --> 55:39.600
it was just my brother, my brother, and me.

55:39.600 --> 55:41.520
Well, we didn't start Maximum Fun.

55:41.520 --> 55:43.040
When we started with Maximum Fun,

55:43.040 --> 55:45.120
thank you, Griffin, that preposition was essential.

55:45.120 --> 55:46.480
We started with Maximum Fun,

55:46.480 --> 55:48.000
it was just my brother, my brother, and me.

55:48.000 --> 55:49.040
And then when we decided like,

55:49.040 --> 55:51.440
hey, we could take time away from other things

55:51.440 --> 55:53.680
to do this podcast thing

55:53.680 --> 55:56.240
because folks seemed to like it

55:56.240 --> 55:58.320
and we're making a little bit of money off of it.

55:58.320 --> 56:00.560
So why don't we do more?

56:00.560 --> 56:03.840
So that's why we did The Adventure Zone

56:03.840 --> 56:05.840
and we did Big Gulp

56:05.840 --> 56:10.880
and we did Schmanners and Sawbones and-

56:10.880 --> 56:11.840
Bunker Buddies.

56:11.840 --> 56:12.560
Bunker Buddies.

56:12.560 --> 56:13.680
Trends like these.

56:13.680 --> 56:15.120
Can I Pet Your Dog?

56:15.120 --> 56:16.320
Yeah, that's when we started Bullseye.

56:16.320 --> 56:17.440
Still Buffering.

56:17.440 --> 56:20.640
Yeah, and we did all those podcasts

56:20.640 --> 56:24.400
because you fine folks supported us

56:24.400 --> 56:26.960
and it allows us to do less.

56:26.960 --> 56:28.880
Like we said, Travis made this his full-time job.

56:28.880 --> 56:30.320
I work less at my day job now

56:30.320 --> 56:34.560
because I need more time to make shows for folks.

56:34.560 --> 56:38.240
I also wanna say like, I love Max Fun

56:38.240 --> 56:39.840
and I love the Max Fun Drive

56:39.840 --> 56:41.920
because basically it's a two-week period

56:41.920 --> 56:44.960
of people talking about how special Maximum Fun is.

56:44.960 --> 56:46.960
And I agree because sometimes the internet

56:46.960 --> 56:50.000
can get really bogged down with really terrible people

56:50.000 --> 56:51.920
who just complain about the things they love,

56:51.920 --> 56:54.160
which is such a weird thing to do.

56:54.160 --> 56:55.920
But everyone, like they love something so much

56:55.920 --> 56:57.600
that all they can do is complain about it

56:57.600 --> 56:58.880
when it disappoints them.

56:58.880 --> 57:02.480
It is the most supportive and inclusive community

57:02.480 --> 57:03.280
basically ever.

57:03.280 --> 57:05.520
Every time we get out to a Max Fun Con,

57:06.560 --> 57:08.560
it's like just the best time ever

57:08.560 --> 57:10.480
hanging out with the best folks ever.

57:10.480 --> 57:12.160
Speaking of, if you want to hang out

57:12.160 --> 57:13.840
with other members of the Max Fun community.

57:15.840 --> 57:19.440
Oh God, Rachel's spraying off the window of my office.

57:19.440 --> 57:21.280
She just scared the shit out of me.

57:22.160 --> 57:22.800
Rachel did?

57:23.360 --> 57:23.680
Yeah.

57:24.240 --> 57:24.880
I mean, she's not-

57:24.880 --> 57:25.680
Spraying off the window.

57:25.680 --> 57:28.240
I think you said sprang off the window.

57:28.240 --> 57:29.360
Yeah, Rachel's doing some fucking-

57:29.360 --> 57:30.720
What kind of cat woman shed is she pulling?

57:30.720 --> 57:33.920
Yeah, well, she's training for the Ninja Warrior.

57:33.920 --> 57:36.400
Anyway, I've told her not to do it on the glass.

57:36.400 --> 57:37.280
You know what I mean?

57:37.280 --> 57:40.720
Like the course is not gonna be made out of glass.

57:40.720 --> 57:44.480
Anyway, forgot completely what I was talking about.

57:44.480 --> 57:46.400
Oh, there's meetups next week.

57:46.400 --> 57:47.760
Next Tuesday, if you go to-

57:47.760 --> 57:49.040
Or this Tuesday, tomorrow.

57:49.040 --> 57:50.320
This Tuesday, that's right.

57:50.320 --> 57:52.320
Go to maximumfun.org slash meetups

57:52.320 --> 57:54.720
and you can see where everything's popping off

57:54.720 --> 57:57.760
in different cities across these United States of America.

57:57.760 --> 57:59.760
Is there something happening in LA that you're going to, Trav?

57:59.760 --> 58:04.240
Yeah, Teresa and I and basically all of my co-hosts that live here

58:04.240 --> 58:08.000
are going to Club TG, T-E-E-G-E-E.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.760
So yeah, go hang out.

58:09.760 --> 58:11.760
Seriously, everybody I've ever met through these shows

58:11.760 --> 58:12.960
has been fucking radical.

58:13.840 --> 58:16.960
There's also a special promotion going away

58:16.960 --> 58:19.200
where Max Fun is giving away a Breville product,

58:19.200 --> 58:23.680
a kitchen appliance and favorite of John Hodgman.

58:23.680 --> 58:25.200
If you tweet a link to the donate page,

58:25.200 --> 58:26.960
which is maximumfun.org slash donate,

58:26.960 --> 58:29.360
along with a statement of why you love Maximum Fun

58:29.360 --> 58:30.720
or why people should support it,

58:30.720 --> 58:33.200
and you use the hashtag toast to Max Fun,

58:33.920 --> 58:35.360
they will pick the one they like the best

58:35.360 --> 58:38.320
and they will get Hodgman's favorite Breville product.

58:38.320 --> 58:41.680
I'm assuming it is a toaster just based on the hashtag.

58:41.680 --> 58:44.640
Anyway, let's talk about what other GIFs people can expect

58:44.640 --> 58:45.840
at the higher donation levels.

58:45.840 --> 58:48.720
Well, we talked about the bonus content for $5,

58:48.720 --> 58:51.120
the bandana for $10 and the adventure kit for $20.

58:51.120 --> 58:53.840
For $35, you get all that stuff

58:53.840 --> 58:58.480
and you get a really beautiful Max Fun emblazoned vacuum thermos.

58:59.680 --> 59:01.760
Keeps your hot drinks hot, your cold drinks cold,

59:01.760 --> 59:03.360
your medium drinks medium.

59:05.360 --> 59:06.880
Hides your gold from the lizard men

59:06.880 --> 59:08.320
who can't see inside of vacuums.

59:08.320 --> 59:10.000
And can I tell you a secret folks?

59:10.000 --> 59:10.640
What's that?

59:10.640 --> 59:12.560
Maybe you are already a donor.

59:13.280 --> 59:14.800
That's awesome, thank you so much.

59:14.800 --> 59:16.720
Surprise, that's the secret.

59:16.720 --> 59:18.400
You're a donor already and you didn't know it.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.600
We've been hacking your account

59:21.600 --> 59:24.480
and you are a $35 a month donor

59:24.480 --> 59:26.400
and you're looking at that $100 a month level

59:26.400 --> 59:27.440
and you're like, I don't know.

59:27.440 --> 59:29.840
There's a secret $50 a month level

59:29.840 --> 59:32.560
for upgrading donors that you can move up to

59:32.560 --> 59:34.720
if you're not quite ready to make that jump to 100.

59:35.280 --> 59:36.640
So don't worry.

59:36.640 --> 59:38.240
If you're not already a donor

59:38.240 --> 59:39.440
and you just listened to that

59:39.440 --> 59:41.200
and processed it with your brain,

59:41.200 --> 59:43.120
you're a criminal technically.

59:43.120 --> 59:44.640
Now you have to become a donor.

59:45.440 --> 59:47.920
But above that, there is a $100 per month level

59:47.920 --> 59:49.920
if you maybe you're flush

59:49.920 --> 59:51.600
and you really, really like our shows

59:51.600 --> 59:52.480
and you want to help support us,

59:52.480 --> 59:55.680
there is a what's called The Inner Circle,

59:55.680 --> 59:56.880
which is our monthly culture club.

59:56.880 --> 59:57.600
You get all the other stuff,

59:57.600 --> 59:59.520
bonus episodes, the thermos, all that.

59:59.520 --> 01:00:01.680
But you also get to be a member of The Inner Circle

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:06.240
and every month, a host of a max fun show

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:07.600
picks some cultural thing.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:08.720
Maybe it's a book, maybe it's a movie,

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:09.760
maybe it's an album.

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.080
And you will get a copy of that

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.960
as well as a sort of written explanation

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.640
as to why it is so special to those people.

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:21.360
For us, last year we selected the album Music Evolution

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:26.080
by the hip hop, jazz, funk band Buckshot Le Funk,

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.800
which is like literally one of my favorite albums

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:29.520
basically ever.

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.040
It was very formative when I was a child.

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.480
Thank you to the Men in Black soundtrack

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.520
for pointing me their way.

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:36.560
If you really want to go hog wild,

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:37.440
we have a little record.

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:39.600
If you really want to go hog wild

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:40.880
for $200 per month,

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:44.320
you can get free registration for Max Fun Con 2017,

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:46.000
which again, like I just said, is a blast.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.600
It's full of the coolest people ever.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.040
Get to eat a bunch of dope ass food

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.160
on top of a mountain.

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:52.560
Get drunk with your favorite podcasters.

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.320
So yeah, we don't expect that people are gonna,

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.000
like a lot of folks are gonna come in at those levels.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.120
That's kind of a big ask.

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:01.200
But if you have, you know,

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.480
if you really enjoy our shows,

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.640
if you enjoy My Bim Bam and The Adventure Zone

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.640
and Sawbones and Bunker Buddies

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:08.880
and the rest of the shows that we do

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:09.760
and you want to support us,

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:12.400
just go to maximumfund.org slash donate.

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:13.440
There's a questionnaire about like

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:17.120
which podcasts you listen to, just fill that out.

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.680
And we really appreciate your support.

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:22.240
It helps us out immeasurably.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.600
And what's really special about that

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.520
is the shows that you say you listen to

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:28.960
are the shows that get funded by your donation.

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:32.480
So it's a very direct one-in-one kind of support.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.800
So it's not just like spread throughout Max Fun

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:36.880
and you don't know where your dollars are going.

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:39.920
The shows that you say you listen to are supported by you.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.680
We are recording this a little bit early.

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:45.520
But at last check, we were about halfway

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.040
to our 5,000 member goal.

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:49.440
And obviously like we want to smash that goal

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.440
and keep going higher and higher.

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.000
So I don't know where we're going to be out on Monday,

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.080
but please, you know, help us meet that goal.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.680
Help us crush and destroy that goal.

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:58.960
Help us embarrass that goal.

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.720
Help us humiliate that goal.

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.480
And that goal is new and upgrading.

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.640
So if you've been a donor for a long time

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:08.640
and now you went from listening to like one show to 12,

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.560
maybe consider up in that donation

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:11.760
and supporting even more shows.

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:14.000
Because if you don't update the shows that you listen to,

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.600
they're not getting supported by you.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:21.280
And if you want fucking more reason to donate.

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.720
Oh God, I hate doing these.

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:26.320
Let me think.

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:43.520
Sometimes in life you want to buy a boat.

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:54.400
But you don't have the money that salesmen require for boats.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:07.840
But that sea is calling to me.

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:16.720
You've got to give to the Maximum Fun Drive.

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:26.720
Maximum Fun Drive.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.720
Maximum Fun Drive.

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:34.720
What I liked about that was that I want a boat

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.400
and I don't have the money needed for the boat.

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:37.680
I'm going to take another stab at it.

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.200
I'm going to focus on this boat because gang,

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.040
we didn't mention this in the notes, but I really...

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.840
You could do more with the boat thing.

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:46.080
Okay.

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.200
What was that?

01:03:53.200 --> 01:04:10.080
That was a weird mid bar key change.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:19.520
What do you do when you've got a little boat?

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:30.080
And your friends at the marina, they all make fun of your little boat.

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:38.000
Well, the answer is clear.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:43.120
Give me boat money this year.

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:47.680
It's time for the Maximum Fun Drive.

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.800
Maximum Fun Drive.

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:58.080
The Maximum Fun Drive.

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:08.080
The boat was an allegory for my penis.

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:11.120
Beautiful.

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:16.800
I'm talking about penis enlargement surgery.

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:24.560
The men at the docks make fun of my dick.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:37.040
I wish that the boat men would stop looking at me in the bathroom.

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:42.640
It's supposed to be private place.

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:48.880
Hey, Griffin, what's the number of donors we need to hit to bring back

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.200
jingles permanently?

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:52.480
What's the number of them?

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:55.600
A million donors.

01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:57.520
Wait, hold on.

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:01.200
If we hit 5,000 donors, I'm getting an Adventure Zone tattoo,

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:04.000
but it takes you a million donors to do jingles.

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:05.600
Birthing these creations.

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:07.680
John Coulson wrote a song a day.

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:10.400
That's Joko.

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.640
That ain't me.

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:13.520
A song a day.

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:17.280
Go to MaximumFun.org, forward slash donate now while you're thinking about it.

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.960
I don't play this acoustic guitar anymore.

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:20.000
It stinks.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:20.880
I don't know what's going on.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.160
The strings actually stink.

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:23.680
They actually smell very bad.

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.280
I don't want to be touching it anymore.

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.080
That's what I was saying.

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.360
Like, I'd love to read it back.

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.040
A, I like listen to them.

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:32.800
B, it's a nice sort of like halftime for me and Scraps.

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:33.120
Yeah.

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:36.560
Like play Galaxy of Heroes on our iPhones and fucking chill for a second.

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:39.520
I did three Hearthstone matches in there.

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.560
Yeah, that's awesome.

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:41.120
Cool.

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:45.280
A coworker of mine brought some delicious bone-in chicken wings to work for lunch

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:46.400
and offered me one.

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:50.560
I gladly accepted, but fumbled the hand off and dropped the wing.

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:53.040
Rather than let said wing go to waste,

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:57.040
I removed the skin from the side that touched the carpet and ate the wing.

01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:00.160
Now everyone in the office thinks I'm a dirty floor eater.

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.280
Am I good?

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:04.400
Germs can't make it through the protective skin instantly, right?

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:05.760
What was I supposed to do?

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.040
Let the wing go to waste?

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:10.000
And that's from Five Second Faux Pas in Dallas.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:10.880
This is horrible.

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:18.960
You can't, it's not about, everyone's so worried about germs, right?

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:19.760
And germs are bad.

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:21.120
Don't get me wrong, germs are very bad.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:22.240
I've watched Contagion, okay?

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:23.840
They took Gwyneth Paltrow from us, I hate it.

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:26.480
Germs aren't great.

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:28.400
I really want to make my position known on germs.

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.360
I think they stink.

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:34.320
But there's a sort of social germ that is invisible and intangible

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:36.160
and it won't make you sick, but it'll make me sick

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:38.080
if I let you eat a wing off the floor.

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.720
Especially a sloppy, sloppy wing.

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:44.560
A wing is the worst possible, it's like you engineered,

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:47.280
gotta have meat on it, gotta be very sticky.

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:50.880
The only thing worse is if you dump soup on the ground

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:52.800
and vacuum it out through a straw.

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:55.120
Yeah, no, I think wing's actually worse than that.

01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:58.000
Than carpet soup?

01:07:59.520 --> 01:07:59.920
Yes.

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.720
I tell you who's really at fault here.

01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:03.360
Who's that, Travis?

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:04.560
It's the coworker.

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:06.720
The coworker who saw you drop your wing

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:08.080
and did not instantly say,

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:10.720
I will give you another, please throw that wing away.

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:15.120
This was not your one and only wing opportunity.

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:17.840
I will present you with another wing, please do not do this.

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:20.160
That's what I, I think that's a bigger problem

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:22.480
than like the germ aspect.

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:25.840
It's just like the steez that you immediately have

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:27.280
is like person who doesn't know

01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:29.440
where people are buying wings all the time.

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:31.120
Like, where did you find this?

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:32.880
This is the only crack I have at this.

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:34.640
I just, I'll just, yeah, whatever.

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:35.840
I may never wing again.

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:37.600
This is a barefoot office.

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:40.960
God, wait, what?

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:42.960
What is that?

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:44.320
Like Google or Pixar

01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:46.800
where everybody's like on razor scooters at bare feet.

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:49.280
Or just the beach because you're a surf instructor.

01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:52.160
The whole world's my office, man.

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:54.400
As long as it's a beach.

01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:57.440
As long as it's specifically a beach.

01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:00.080
I cannot work in like a suburban area.

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.120
Yeah, and honestly,

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.280
if we could try to keep it in the,

01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:04.800
just sort of the Malibu area.

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:06.800
I have lost my license.

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:08.880
Yeah, this, more like this.

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:10.800
If I go a hundred feet that way,

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:14.640
that's sort of a surfberg's territory

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.080
and a hundred feet the other way,

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:19.040
sort of like surfing Dan's surfing class territory.

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.400
So like, if we actually,

01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:22.240
my office is actually this office.

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:23.200
Now that I think about it,

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:24.800
this is pretty much the only place

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:25.840
that I could teach surfing.

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.640
It's amazing to me how contentious

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:31.120
and territorial surf instructors get.

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:31.680
Yeah.

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:34.480
Man, we've lost too many people too young

01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:35.920
to surf instructor beefs.

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.040
This is my beach.

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:38.400
Like this isn't Arby's.

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:43.200
There's a small fishing pond three and a half miles away.

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:45.760
This is not, this ain't your beach.

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:47.120
This ain't your beach.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:48.880
I thought you said this is our beach

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.760
and then I put it together and you said Arby's.

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:54.640
You know, another funny thing you could say about this.

01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.400
Oh no.

01:09:58.400 --> 01:09:58.960
Oh no.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:00.160
Just back to back.

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:00.800
Back to back.

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:02.160
Are you positive?

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:03.360
Yeah, I'm positive.

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:04.960
Is a haunted doll watch folks

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:07.920
and it's coming to you live from eBay,

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:09.280
the electronic bay.

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.800
It's bringing word of haunted dolls

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:11.760
from all over the world.

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:15.120
This one is a haunted vintage doll,

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:16.400
paranormal spirit vessel,

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:17.440
active EMF.

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:18.320
A lot of SEO,

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.520
not so much a name.

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:22.320
Do we need a vintage modifier on that?

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.160
Is anybody like bringing home a fucking like,

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:24.960
oh, this is Susan.

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:26.080
She's a new American girl.

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:26.560
Ah, fuck.

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:27.120
She's haunted.

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:27.440
Damn it.

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:28.720
I just spent $300 on this.

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.920
I can't believe it got ghosts all up in it.

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:34.320
Yeah.

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.240
Haunted dolls found in the storage

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.920
after grandma passed away.

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:39.760
I'm having paranormal activity

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:41.440
after bringing these dolls home.

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:43.120
At first I was very scared,

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:45.520
but now I'm spending more time with each doll

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:48.240
in order to get a sense of their energy

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:51.120
and give the buyer as much information as possible.

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:51.680
That's nice.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.760
You gotta really spend some time with your dolls

01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:54.880
to get to know them.

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:55.040
Yeah.

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:56.720
They're really filling in the blanks.

01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:59.280
The next sentence of this eBay listing is,

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:01.520
I am what they call a sensitive.

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:03.520
Oh my God.

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:08.080
You know, I'm not sure if karma is real

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:09.360
or Kisnet or what have you,

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:10.640
whatever, whatever, you know,

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:13.520
sort of higher power you believe in.

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:17.120
But boy, isn't it lucky how people

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:20.080
who are sensitive to the spiritual comings

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:23.280
and goings often inherit large doll collections

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:24.960
from their dead grandmothers.

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:26.160
It's funny how those,

01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:27.440
you don't find a lot of guy,

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:29.760
like just like dudes named Carl

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:32.160
inheriting a bunch of dolls from their dead grandma.

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:35.040
My sensitive friend told me that these dolls were haunted,

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.880
but I swear to God, I get nothing.

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:40.480
Why are you cursing with this lack of sensitivity?

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.880
Damn, I wish I could commune with you beautiful babies.

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:44.080
I love it.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:45.680
Damn, I could tell,

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:48.320
I could tell it behind each of your dead porcelain eyes.

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.760
You each got a story to tell,

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.840
but I just can't hear it with my dumb,

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:54.080
non-sensitive ears, damn it, Carl.

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.760
Therefore, I'm able to use all my senses

01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:58.880
and feel spirits.

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:03.120
My grandma was a kind, loving spirit.

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:05.520
My Aunt Angelica was a healer

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:07.120
and that baby from Rugrats

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:08.400
and a psychic in her account.

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.760
I was taken care of by my aunt.

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:13.040
So I learned how to perceive

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:15.360
and work with energy from an early age.

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:17.280
Fuck, you are such a good pick

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:19.520
for a huge old doll collection.

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:21.760
I cannot believe how lucky we are

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:23.440
that these two things lined up.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:26.080
Justin, you don't hear about the 100,000 other times

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:26.880
that people like,

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:28.640
those people aren't gonna get on eBay and say,

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:32.000
I've got a shitload of dolls possibly haunted.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.440
I have no fucking clue.

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:36.640
History is written by the sensitives.

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.200
Yeah, and also I liked it.

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:41.040
At first, this person was scared.

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.120
It's like, hey, hey,

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.600
you spent your whole life training for this moment.

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:47.280
Are you sure you're scared?

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.400
This is like the best.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:49.760
Well, maybe it was like, you know,

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.280
moving up to the big show scared.

01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:52.320
Like the first time,

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:54.160
like, you know, you're the backup quarterback.

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:57.200
The starting quarterback goes down with like a broken hammy

01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:59.040
and you're called in and he's like,

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:00.000
now you're a quarterback now.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.600
And you're like, I'm scared, but I'm ready.

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:02.320
So maybe that was it.

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:03.360
Like he inherited the dolls.

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:05.280
He threw open the storage room door,

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:06.400
like on Storage Wars.

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:09.200
He just saw a bunch of dead black eyes

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:10.160
staring back at him.

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:12.400
And he was like, I'm ready.

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:14.480
I'm scared, but I'm ready.

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:17.600
Don't you guys wanna know at all about this doll?

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:18.720
Don't you wanna know about it?

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:20.880
Yeah, I mean, typically this is the part

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:22.640
that is kind of sad.

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.080
I perceive a very spoiled rich girl

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:27.600
who grew up without her mother.

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:29.040
Her father was a businessman

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:30.880
who traveled all out of the country

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:32.560
and left her alone with her nanny

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:34.880
and hired help to care for her.

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:37.520
She was homeschooled and didn't develop good social skills.

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:40.080
Therefore she grew up resentful and untrusting of others.

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:42.800
She does not respond when I ask her name,

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:44.800
but I keep getting Gretchen in my head.

01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:46.480
I keep getting Gretchen in my head

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:48.000
as my favorite Johnny Cash song.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.880
And it's a sad, slow ballad, and I love it.

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:54.960
She has a stubborn and very determined strong personality

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:56.400
that I'm not comfortable with.

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.200
Wow.

01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:59.360
Okay, shit.

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:01.440
The lights have flickered on and off,

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:03.680
and I feel a pulling sensation from her

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:05.520
as if she wants to draw me in.

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:09.520
I would advise caution in establishing boundaries with her.

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:13.120
How stubborn can she be if she's trying to pull you in, dawg?

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:15.680
She's trying to pull you in, dawg, she wants to engage.

01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:17.520
This sounds like a frustrated parent

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.840
giving their child up for adoption.

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.360
This is like, it's not my fault

01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:24.320
you didn't break this puppet spirit.

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:27.200
I'm bothered by the fact that this judgmental turd

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:30.960
who is making this starts off by saying she's very spoiled.

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:32.640
She grew up without a mother.

01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:36.080
Like right there, like you know what's up

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:37.920
and you're still being a turd about it.

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:40.640
This is the ending.

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:43.280
I have left her and gone to bed

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:45.360
and have felt her hovering over me.

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:48.560
It's just what I feel, very disturbing energy.

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:50.800
Her face, arms, and feet are porcelain with a soft body.

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:52.320
She measures 16 inches tall.

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:53.440
Oh, see, don't breeze over that.

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:56.560
That's what I, as a collector, that's the stuff I want to know.

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:58.720
I mean, the spirit, the living spirit that lives inside her.

01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:01.520
That's great and everything, but I've got like a,

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.200
I've got like a dollhouse thing going on

01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:04.480
and I don't want some big ass doll.

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:06.960
It's like too big for the tea set I have set up.

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:09.440
I'll say that this seller is not really good

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.120
at selling.

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:13.760
I got this doll, she's creepy as shit.

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:15.280
She's going to hover over you.

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:16.400
I do not like it.

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:19.360
Please take this creepy doll and give me money for it.

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:20.960
Holy fucking shit.

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:22.720
You guys are not going to believe me,

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:25.040
but this listing actually ends with,

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:26.880
and I just said it to you so you believe me,

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:29.200
her face, arms, and feet are porcelain with a soft body.

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.320
She measures 16 feet tall.

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:31.920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:33.600
No, it can't, it can't be.

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.200
She measures 16 feet tall.

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:36.160
No, no.

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:37.840
Yes, I love my tall doll wife.

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:40.400
I love my tall doll.

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:41.840
I am 13 feet tall.

01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:44.160
My haunted doll wife is 16 feet tall.

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:44.800
I love how big.

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:45.760
I felt her hover over me,

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:47.520
but it does not match up one and one

01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:49.440
because she is three feet taller than I am.

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:51.840
She's 16 feet tall.

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:56.640
I love how my tall haunted wife physically dominates me.

01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:59.760
I feel so pressurized by my tall doll wife.

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:01.040
I love her haunted physique.

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:03.920
She does not feel private.

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:05.040
I feel such judgment.

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.400
This is a full blown like,

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:07.760
Yes.

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:09.520
80s horror movie.

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:12.080
Like, hello, daddy.

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:14.960
Like, oh, fuck, no.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.440
Yeah, the last line is,

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:20.640
also, this is viral marketing for the new Ghostbusters movie.

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:21.840
Check it out in theaters.

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:22.720
It's coming soon.

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:24.480
Leslie Jones is in it.

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:25.680
She's hysterical.

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:28.560
This is actually viral marketing for Goofbusters 2,

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:30.080
this episode of My Brother, My Brother, Me.

01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:34.400
This has been so much fun to revisit some of our old classics.

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:38.560
Maybe not as many as we thought there was gonna be.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.880
So if you're about to tweet us and ask,

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:42.800
whatever happened to blank?

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:44.000
This is your answer.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.200
It died here.

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.400
See you again next year.

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.000
Hopefully not.

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:53.120
I also wanna remind you, maximumfun.org forward slash donate.

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:58.080
You know, even if $5 is the most you can do,

01:16:58.080 --> 01:16:59.040
if you can carve out $5,

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.200
that's great.

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:02.400
That means the world to us.

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:07.600
Every bit you could donate really does help a lot,

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:11.440
and it helps to show that this is a thing that you love,

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:13.360
and this network is a thing that you love,

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:16.560
and it helps us to make more things that you can love.

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:19.120
And be sure that when you donate that you tweet at us

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:20.720

and it means a lot to us that you decided to support the show.

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:26.960
Oh, and before we forget,

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:30.720
the Max Fun Drive is gonna wrap up on the 25th

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:34.800
with a live streaming Jordan Jesse Goh from Max Fun HQ.

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.800
I'm going to be there and be on it,

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:39.680
and a bunch of my co-hosts here in LA are gonna be there,

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:41.280
and they will probably be on it too.

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:43.040
But make sure you check that out.

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:45.680

I want to thank John Roderick of the Long Winters

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:08.800
for the use of our theme song,

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:10.480
It Set Apart Your Off, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:12.400
It's a wonderful, wonderful album, a great song.

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:15.600
We're very thankful to John and the Long Winters

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:16.480
for letting us use it.

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:18.560
Yeah, thank you.

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:19.760
And we're thankful to you.

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:21.040
And we're so thankful to you.

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:22.320
So thankful.

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:23.760
You guys want that final yahoo?

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:24.400
Yes, please.

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:26.640
I didn't pick one, shit.

01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:27.440
Well, we'll just do this one.

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.120
It was sent in by Brighton High, Zoe Kinski.

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:29.680
Thank you, Zoe.

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:30.640
It's by yahoo answers user.

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:31.920
Sorry, something has gone wrong.

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:32.800
I'll go one name down.

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:33.680
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:34.400
One more name down.

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:35.280
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.320
One more name down.

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:36.820
Nope.

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:45.840
My face in the rain asks, why are calzones called calzones

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:46.960
and not pizza sandwiches?

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:50.720
Oh, my name is Justin McElroy.

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:51.680
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:52.720
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:53.920
It's been my brother, my brother, me.

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:54.800
Kiss your dad.

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:58.400
Square on the lips.

Together, we make up the MaxFun podcast, Lady to Lady.

Each week, we welcome a kick-ass lady guest.

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:28.720
We talk about our lives, our dreams,

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:31.040
and the terrible decisions we've made that still haunt us.

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:34.480
We've had on great comedians like Aisha Tyler and Margaret

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.880
Troe, plus screenwriters, doctors, authors,

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:39.280
you know, anyone who's willing to be as open as we are.

01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:40.320
It's all a lot of fun.

01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:41.760
That's us, Lady to Lady.

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:42.800
Can you keep a secret?

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:52.800
Neither.
