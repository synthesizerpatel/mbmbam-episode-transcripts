00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.160
Welcome, my brother, my brother and me. This week, we're all about the supermoon.

00:49.520 --> 00:56.160
What's up? It's like a moon and a half. Like, I got used to a certain level of, uh, I became accustomed

00:56.160 --> 01:03.040
to a certain level of moon, but now, like, the standard, the, the, it's, it's, uh, it changed

01:03.040 --> 01:09.680
the paradigm for moon, for moon paradigms. For me, personally, it was like that one scene from Bruce

01:09.680 --> 01:16.080
Almighty where he pulls the moon down and then he, like, starts kissing on Jennifer Aniston.

01:17.200 --> 01:20.640
Griffin, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I just want you to know I've been meaning to say something

01:20.640 --> 01:24.800
for a while. I'm starting to worry about the amount of Bruce Almighty references you make.

01:24.800 --> 01:28.480
Like, it's starting to be, like, like a constant stream of, like, Bruce Almighty.

01:28.480 --> 01:34.160
I have to, I have to relate this Bruce Almighty story to you guys. When the supermoon happened,

01:34.160 --> 01:40.720
my bride, my wife, looked at it and Sidney said, that looks like, uh, uh, that reminds me of that

01:40.720 --> 01:45.600
scene in Bruce Almighty, and I told her I hadn't seen it, and she proceeded to, over the next seven

01:45.600 --> 01:52.320
minutes, relate the entire plot of Bruce Almighty to me. I never egged her on. I never said, uh-huh,

01:52.320 --> 01:57.040
do tell, tell me more, like, the whole plot, and then at the end, I said, well, that was everything

01:57.040 --> 02:00.160
that happens in Bruce Almighty, I guess. I'll tell you, I'll tell you what's so surprising to

02:00.160 --> 02:05.440
me about that story, Justin. Tell me. I'm surprised, not that your wife went through

02:05.440 --> 02:10.560
the pains to tell you what happens, but that it took her seven whole minutes. I know. Well,

02:10.560 --> 02:16.240
there's a lot of shit. He gets god powers from, from Morgan Freeman, and he fucks up with him,

02:16.240 --> 02:20.160
and then he gives him back, and he learns lessons. Yeah, no, you're ignoring the lessons, though.

02:20.160 --> 02:25.040
This, she went into some of the specific lessons that he picks up along the way, and then she said,

02:25.040 --> 02:28.160
and now we're, and at the end, she said, well, now I guess we're all ready to see

02:28.160 --> 02:31.920
Evan Almighty, which I don't plan on doing that, either. This is My Brother, My Brother,

02:31.920 --> 02:38.480
Me. It's an advice show for the modern era. I am, uh, the eldest McElroy, Justin. And I am Travis.

02:39.600 --> 02:46.640
And, and I am, I, and I, Griffin. I wanted to, I wanted to sound like a knight. We take your,

02:46.640 --> 02:50.640
uh, we take your questions, and we turn them into wisdom. Let's do it. My life sucks.

02:50.640 --> 02:55.200
Oh. Here are a few examples why I feel that way. I'm unmotivated. I work at Target, and I never

02:55.200 --> 02:59.920
have any money. I would like to go to school and get my education papers so that I can do more of

02:59.920 --> 03:03.520
the things I want to do in my life. Problem being that I've been to school for a year and dropped

03:03.520 --> 03:09.600
out both semesters in a row because of frequent gravity bong usage. My depression drove me to move

03:09.600 --> 03:14.320
across the country, but I'm even more confused. What should I change so I can quit this wretched

03:14.320 --> 03:23.200
job? Kyle. Kyle? Kyle, you just gotta step it back. You gotta walk. You know, you know that part,

03:23.200 --> 03:26.160
footprints, where it's like, where there's a single pair, that's where I carried you?

03:27.040 --> 03:31.440
If you look at your footprints, the parts where they kind of go astray and wander into the ocean

03:31.440 --> 03:36.720
are where you set a gravity bong down. And then there's a Kyle-shaped indent in the ground,

03:36.720 --> 03:41.440
that's where you fell down. And just took a nap for a while. Just took a nap for a while,

03:41.440 --> 03:46.880
then you wandered into Target, the Target ocean. All of these things, unmotivated, that you just,

03:46.880 --> 03:50.480
you know, you can control that. You work at Target, you can control that. You never have

03:50.480 --> 03:55.600
any money, you can control that. Like, all of these things are within your reach.

03:56.320 --> 04:03.600
There seems to be one keystone in place. It's this heavy gravity bong that he's using for doobers.

04:04.960 --> 04:07.200
Do you guys know what a gravity bong is? Can someone explain that to me?

04:07.200 --> 04:14.400
Sure. You jump off a building, and as you're falling, it's the most extreme kind of bonging

04:14.960 --> 04:15.360
you can do.

04:15.360 --> 04:20.160
I mean, I don't know what it means, but it seems like every bong is a gravity bong, right?

04:21.360 --> 04:22.960
There's an anti-gravity bong.

04:22.960 --> 04:23.520
No, there's like a-

04:23.520 --> 04:24.880
See, that would be fucking rad.

04:25.680 --> 04:34.240
It's like a, it's like a, you put a bottle of marijuana in a bucket, I think, and then

04:34.240 --> 04:39.040
as the smoke goes up, there's a change of air pressure, and the bottle floats with the weed in

04:39.040 --> 04:42.160
it. I don't know. I'm not a, I don't, I don't do this.

04:42.160 --> 04:42.720
Is this real? Are you making this up?

04:42.720 --> 04:48.160
Let me, I'm gonna throw you an answer that I think maybe, if you add two letters to an important

04:48.160 --> 04:54.400
word in this question, you can change it. Maybe instead of frequent gravity bong, infrequent

04:54.400 --> 05:01.760
gravity bong usage, I have an occasional, an irregular schedule of gravity bong usage.

05:01.760 --> 05:08.640
You can still hit the graph every now and then, but not, not Monday through Friday,

05:08.640 --> 05:12.880
and then twice on Saturdays, but every other Sunday.

05:12.880 --> 05:17.920
Just pretend, just say like, hey, did I do my homework? Well, it's time to gravity bong.

05:19.440 --> 05:24.720
So that's it. You set up a reward system. Like, I just ran two miles, time to grav bong,

05:25.360 --> 05:29.280
and then you grav bong, and then it probably cancels out, whatever.

05:29.280 --> 05:33.680
But whatever you do, don't reward yourself before you do something like,

05:33.680 --> 05:36.160
you know, I think I've decided to go for a two mile run.

05:36.880 --> 05:39.760
I'm so proud of myself. I'm going to hit this gravity bong.

05:39.760 --> 05:41.520
I'm going to have my dessert first.

05:42.560 --> 05:43.120
Don't do that.

05:43.120 --> 05:46.160
It's like sneaking a, sneaking a present on Christmas Eve, except,

05:47.120 --> 05:51.440
except you get high, I guess. You get high and you don't do anything, and then you work at Target.

05:51.440 --> 05:54.480
Nothing wrong with working at Target, by the way. It's, I think it's the,

05:54.480 --> 05:58.720
the most high class of all, you know, mega retailers.

05:58.720 --> 06:01.280
I think so, definitely. I met a wonderful girl.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.200
They got Isaac Mizrahi stuff.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.800
Yeah, it's really nice. Some Todd, uh, what's that guy, Todd?

06:06.800 --> 06:08.000
Oldum, Todd Oldum.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.400
Todd, Todd Oldum gear. I met a really wonderful girl with lots of wonderful

06:12.400 --> 06:14.800
qualities and similar interests to my own, but there is a catch.

06:14.800 --> 06:19.120
She's about seven years younger than me. I'm just out of college. We're both of legal age,

06:19.120 --> 06:23.040
but I am still worried about the social implications of dating someone who's a good deal younger.

06:23.040 --> 06:26.720
I don't want everyone to think I'm some creeper.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.360
Would pursuing such a relationship be, uh,

06:29.360 --> 06:32.560
condemnable or commendable? Scared of disapproving looks.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.360
I'm trying to, this is like one of those brain teasers.

06:37.360 --> 06:42.960
There's like, there are three brothers and one is, you know, Joey's older than Todd,

06:42.960 --> 06:47.920
but younger than Roger. I'm trying to figure out what these ages are.

06:47.920 --> 06:50.480
Let's say like somewhere between, if she's still in college,

06:50.480 --> 06:55.040
it's gotta be between 18 and 25 or 22 and 29.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.200
Either way, bro, you're not fresh out of college.

06:58.800 --> 07:02.640
The freshness, the shine has come off that apple officially.

07:02.640 --> 07:04.720
He might be just out of college,

07:04.720 --> 07:09.200
but it might have taken him a little longer than it would for a regular Joe.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.480
Maybe he's a doctor.

07:10.480 --> 07:11.360
Maybe he's a doctor.

07:12.320 --> 07:15.920
And if you're a doctor, like this is the expected behavior here.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.800
Or maybe he's following the Kyle path through college.

07:18.800 --> 07:18.960
Yeah.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.200
Take that Kyle.

07:21.200 --> 07:25.520
Kyle, you were taking a graphong hit while we said that and you choked on it.

07:27.120 --> 07:28.960
You choked on your graphong smoke, Kyle.

07:30.080 --> 07:35.280
So I, if you, if you take the existence of the universe as long as a football field,

07:36.240 --> 07:41.920
the existence of humanity would be the width of one blade of grass at the very end of the end zone.

07:42.560 --> 07:49.840
So when you think of it that way, seven years is scientifically speaking, nothing.

07:49.840 --> 07:51.520
When you put it that way, I want to go

07:52.480 --> 07:56.160
fuck everything that moves and jump off of a bridge because it doesn't matter.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.160
Don't think of it that way.

07:58.160 --> 08:00.320
Whatever you do, don't think of it that way.

08:00.320 --> 08:02.400
Your life is meaningless.

08:02.400 --> 08:05.600
Whatever you do is just a breath in the wind.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.880
It is, you know what, in the great cosmic sense, maybe.

08:08.880 --> 08:14.160
So if you are happy, if she makes you happy, go for it.

08:14.880 --> 08:18.240
What's the point of us giving advice anymore if we're just saying

08:18.240 --> 08:20.400
that we're blades of grass on a football field?

08:20.400 --> 08:21.680
Life is empty of consequence.

08:22.320 --> 08:26.400
Kyle, buy an extra gravity bong and do it twice as much, I guess.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.080
Kyle, sell us your gravity bong.

08:29.200 --> 08:34.160
I would say that the difference isn't the age and it's not even the maturity.

08:34.160 --> 08:36.000
It's just like life experience.

08:36.560 --> 08:41.760
And so I believe that the person that someone is when they're like 18

08:41.760 --> 08:46.320
is a completely different person most of the time than they are by the time they're like 23.

08:46.320 --> 08:48.720
Yeah, but like if you're talking action items,

08:48.720 --> 08:51.760
was he supposed to dump her because she might suck in a few?

08:51.760 --> 08:55.920
No, I'm just saying like that is why I think people disapprove of it.

08:55.920 --> 08:57.600
I don't think it's inherently the age.

08:57.600 --> 09:00.880
I think it's like you're taking advantage of someone inexperienced.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.920
So like, you know, eff it.

09:03.920 --> 09:04.480
Here's the thing.

09:04.480 --> 09:05.040
Here's the thing.

09:05.600 --> 09:09.680
Yeah, right now, like seven years probably seems a pretty wide gap.

09:09.680 --> 09:13.600
When you're 80 and she's 73, still no one wants to see you kiss.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.760
I mean, that's all there is to it.

09:15.760 --> 09:16.640
I'm going to be honest.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.320
I never want to see anybody kiss.

09:19.280 --> 09:20.000
Really?

09:20.000 --> 09:26.560
Yeah, like maybe in a movie or like at a wedding or there are a few acceptable occasions.

09:26.560 --> 09:30.640
I was at a concert this past weekend at South Pass Southwest.

09:30.640 --> 09:34.960
Yeah, and there was this couple standing in front of me like every like no joke,

09:36.240 --> 09:39.040
45 seconds to a minute and a half.

09:39.600 --> 09:43.600
They would turn to each other and just like kiss deep and hard.

09:43.600 --> 09:44.480
And that's no good.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.720
Nobody wants to see that.

09:46.720 --> 09:53.200
So I guess the advice there is date her, but don't let anybody know about it.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.720
Just keep it like a secret.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.160
Keep it like a deep secret.

09:57.760 --> 09:58.560
Griffin.

09:58.560 --> 09:59.600
Yeah, I got you.

09:59.600 --> 10:00.640
You know what I need, Boo.

10:01.840 --> 10:03.920
This one was sent in by Matthew Oden.

10:03.920 --> 10:04.960
Thank you, Matthew Oden.

10:06.400 --> 10:10.160
It's written by Yahoo Answers user Starhawk Mystery.

10:10.800 --> 10:11.040
Good.

10:11.680 --> 10:12.400
Good start.

10:12.400 --> 10:12.960
Go on.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.400
That's an old family name.

10:16.160 --> 10:20.240
Who asks this question is short, so don't blink or you'll miss it.

10:20.240 --> 10:20.640
Okay.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.040
How strong is a girl's bond with her horse?

10:29.040 --> 10:32.800
Like she's like empirically like you want to put a number on it.

10:32.800 --> 10:36.400
So you want to talk about like an dynamic force.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.760
Can it take before it snaps?

10:38.960 --> 10:39.440
Yeah.

10:39.440 --> 10:41.120
And in Newton's, please.

10:41.680 --> 10:41.920
Yeah.

10:41.920 --> 10:44.320
What kind of gravitational pull is that horse putting out?

10:44.320 --> 10:48.240
If I were to put that horse in a gravity bong, what kind of water displacement would there

10:48.240 --> 10:48.400
be?

10:49.120 --> 10:50.080
Eureka.

10:50.080 --> 10:50.720
I've discovered.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.440
I put a horse in my gravity bong.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.280
I'm really, really high now, but I-

10:57.280 --> 10:59.600
You put your gravity bong on my horse.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.760
You put your horse in my gravity bong.

11:02.800 --> 11:06.560
Too great taste to get this horse fucked up as shit.

11:06.560 --> 11:11.280
My bond is pretty good with you, but if I could put my mouth on your snoot and suck

11:11.280 --> 11:13.440
pot out of it, I would pretty much.

11:13.440 --> 11:16.400
It would be like super strong, like really, really strong.

11:17.920 --> 11:21.040
I don't know that there's a bond stronger than that between a girl and her horse.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.160
Especially if she lost her virginity to it.

11:24.160 --> 11:26.560
Unless like you sewed the girl and the horse together.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.360
Yeah, that would be pretty strong, I think.

11:30.720 --> 11:34.080
What is the strength of a bond between a girl and her centaur?

11:37.280 --> 11:39.280
How about do you want to hear some answers?

11:39.280 --> 11:42.880
Let's see what other people said, because there are 24 of them.

11:42.880 --> 11:43.520
Oh, good.

11:44.240 --> 11:44.880
Oh, good.

11:44.880 --> 11:49.440
You know, that means that someone looked at it and said those 23 people are sort of describing

11:49.440 --> 11:51.200
how strong a bond between a girl and a horse is.

11:51.200 --> 11:53.200
Let me see if I can get this more on the nose.

11:53.760 --> 11:57.280
See if I can hone this down to the real truth.

11:58.400 --> 12:01.840
If you love horses than as stronger as anything else in the world,

12:01.840 --> 12:04.080
if they are money makers, then nothing is there.

12:06.240 --> 12:07.920
So if you love horses but hate-

12:07.920 --> 12:09.440
So like if the horse has a job.

12:10.080 --> 12:14.880
Yeah, so if you love horses but hate making sense,

12:14.880 --> 12:16.960
then you'll probably be really into horses.

12:16.960 --> 12:19.680
All the girls I know that have horses have small feet,

12:19.680 --> 12:22.240
and they would rather ride their horses than ride their man.

12:22.240 --> 12:25.200
So I guess a woman's bond with her horse is perhaps obsessive.

12:26.160 --> 12:28.480
What kind of porn was this guy searching for?

12:28.480 --> 12:28.800
Listen, no.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.160
He stumbled onto this question.

12:30.160 --> 12:35.600
Hey, listen, he provided us with empirical evidence

12:35.600 --> 12:40.160
to support his his assertion that women love horses more than men.

12:40.160 --> 12:43.520
And that is that they have small feet.

12:43.520 --> 12:44.960
Are there any answers from horses?

12:48.480 --> 12:50.720
Just one that says like, I'd like to stay out of this.

12:50.720 --> 12:51.280
How about this?

12:52.720 --> 12:54.480
No, I think this was written by a horse.

12:55.520 --> 12:56.480
Very strong.

12:56.960 --> 12:58.880
Jake and Christy act like mother and son.

12:59.600 --> 13:00.720
No, really, they do.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.200
He waits for her every night to get there,

13:03.200 --> 13:07.040
and she brings him a peppermint candy and a carrot or apple.

13:08.640 --> 13:11.200
Hey, how was your childhood?

13:11.200 --> 13:12.560
It was pretty dope.

13:12.560 --> 13:14.400
Every night, my mom would visit me,

13:14.400 --> 13:17.280
and she would bring me a peppermint or an apple,

13:17.280 --> 13:19.040
and then she would brush my hair and ride me.

13:19.040 --> 13:21.440
So I guess it was a pretty good childhood, I guess.

13:22.160 --> 13:23.840
Just like a mother and son,

13:23.840 --> 13:26.640
she visits him nightly and brings him an apple.

13:26.640 --> 13:31.120
Guys, I think that this person is writing equestrian fan fiction.

13:31.120 --> 13:33.760
I'm going to throw out the-

13:33.760 --> 13:37.520
On the Yahoo Answers, like, comment section on a question.

13:37.520 --> 13:40.160
This is officially the saddest thing that exists on the internet.

13:40.160 --> 13:41.920
In this circumstance, not always,

13:41.920 --> 13:46.320
but in this circumstance aside is really, really necessary.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.320
Who the fuck are Jake and Christy?

13:48.320 --> 13:49.760
Who are Jake and Christy?

13:49.760 --> 13:51.280
We don't know them just because you do.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.160
That's not how the internet works.

13:52.160 --> 13:54.400
And even better, if it was like a strange name,

13:54.400 --> 13:57.760
if it was like, you know, Bloobity Blue and Schmackity Bad.

13:57.760 --> 13:58.160
Okay, great.

13:58.160 --> 13:58.960
It's made up people.

13:58.960 --> 14:01.520
But Jake and Christy is like, do I know Jake and Christy?

14:02.080 --> 14:03.360
Which one's the horse?

14:03.360 --> 14:04.560
Which one's the horse?

14:05.120 --> 14:06.160
Tell me that.

14:06.160 --> 14:07.440
That's a good question.

14:07.440 --> 14:08.960
Is Jake and Christy the horse's name?

14:08.960 --> 14:12.240
Because that might be like an okay, like, racing horse name.

14:12.240 --> 14:13.280
That would be pretty good.

14:13.280 --> 14:16.080
Because it's like the running speed of two people.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.600
Yeah, there isn't a word.

14:18.480 --> 14:19.920
Horses are basically, if you think about it,

14:19.920 --> 14:21.200
horses are just two people.

14:22.080 --> 14:23.120
Yeah, they are.

14:23.120 --> 14:25.040
Because they're two people with a long neck.

14:25.040 --> 14:26.800
Are you thinking of like a Halloween costume?

14:26.800 --> 14:28.000
Mm-hmm.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.600
I'm thinking of like, no, no.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.240
I'm talking about the actual physiology of a horse.

14:32.240 --> 14:33.280
Oh, sure.

14:33.280 --> 14:34.880
Four legs, right?

14:34.880 --> 14:35.360
Right.

14:35.360 --> 14:37.120
Double-length torso, double-length neck,

14:37.120 --> 14:38.000
double-length face.

14:38.880 --> 14:39.360
Big teeth.

14:40.480 --> 14:40.720
Teeth.

14:40.720 --> 14:41.120
Yeah.

14:41.120 --> 14:42.240
We have those.

14:42.240 --> 14:43.120
Jumping.

14:43.120 --> 14:44.000
Four eyeballs.

14:44.640 --> 14:45.200
Yeah.

14:45.200 --> 14:45.840
What?

14:45.840 --> 14:46.800
And two buttholes.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.680
Yeah, Mr. Ed was a pretty weird shout.

14:53.120 --> 14:55.920
There isn't a word, or a million words,

14:55.920 --> 14:58.000
that could even come close to describing it.

14:58.000 --> 14:58.800
Is there not?

14:59.680 --> 15:01.280
There are not a million words?

15:02.320 --> 15:04.480
Let's see if we can drop a hundred right now.

15:05.040 --> 15:05.760
Oh my god.

15:05.760 --> 15:12.720
Strong, potent, meaningful, robust horseman.

15:16.880 --> 15:20.240
This is my 20 novel series.

15:20.800 --> 15:24.240
It doesn't about how much horses love women

15:24.240 --> 15:25.520
and how strong their bond is.

15:25.520 --> 15:26.880
It doesn't come close.

15:26.880 --> 15:29.680
I wish it came close, but I can't seem to quite get there.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.600
Maybe another million words.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.680
Enough to really ram it home.

15:34.240 --> 15:36.320
Hey, have you ever read Secretariat?

15:36.960 --> 15:39.280
Yeah, that bitch is like 700 pages long.

15:40.560 --> 15:43.440
Nice try, author of Secretariat.

15:43.440 --> 15:44.000
Yeah, nice.

15:44.960 --> 15:45.600
No dice.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.360
Not close and no cigar.

15:49.680 --> 15:52.320
I don't feel comfortable replying thank you

15:52.320 --> 15:55.200
when I have sneezed and someone says bless you.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.040
I don't know why I should thank them,

15:57.040 --> 15:59.280
since I have no affiliation with any religion.

15:59.280 --> 16:01.280
It seems strange to be considered okay

16:01.280 --> 16:03.600
to say bless you to anyone who sneezes.

16:03.600 --> 16:06.960
I've tried just not sneezing, but sometimes it is impossible.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.400
What should I do in this situation?

16:08.400 --> 16:09.680
I usually say nothing.

16:10.320 --> 16:11.200
JZ.

16:11.200 --> 16:11.520
Why?

16:11.520 --> 16:13.200
I would yell, how dare you?

16:14.640 --> 16:16.400
You bitch.

16:16.400 --> 16:19.360
I didn't know that we marketed our show to heathens.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.480
I thought it was mainly religious.

16:22.480 --> 16:22.980
Good.

16:23.920 --> 16:24.640
Good people.

16:24.640 --> 16:25.600
Good Christian people.

16:25.600 --> 16:29.920
Why don't you just take the power that that blessing gives you?

16:29.920 --> 16:31.120
Blessings are imbued with power.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.320
You do understand that, right?

16:33.120 --> 16:37.200
When someone says bless you, they're not just being congenial.

16:37.200 --> 16:38.400
They're giving you power.

16:38.960 --> 16:39.760
Power.

16:39.760 --> 16:42.560
They're giving you abilities, I think.

16:42.560 --> 16:45.680
They're giving you super abilities that you can use,

16:45.680 --> 16:47.360
but only when the super moon's out.

16:48.560 --> 16:52.320
Once every 17 years, you harness all the sneeze blesses you get

16:52.320 --> 16:55.120
and you can channel them into energy balls.

16:55.120 --> 16:55.840
Pyrokinesis.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.160
I mean, why do you give a shit?

17:01.840 --> 17:03.680
The person is doing it to be polite.

17:03.680 --> 17:06.480
It's a social custom more than it is sort of a religious one.

17:07.760 --> 17:12.800
It's derived from people thinking the devil is jumping out of you when you sneeze.

17:12.800 --> 17:15.120
I don't think those people say that, believe that.

17:15.680 --> 17:16.400
I don't think they think...

17:16.400 --> 17:18.880
Do you know the real reason for it?

17:18.880 --> 17:19.840
That's the real reason.

17:19.840 --> 17:20.400
That's not it.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.000
It sure is.

17:22.000 --> 17:22.960
Not quite.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.240
What do you think?

17:24.240 --> 17:30.800
I thought it was because when you sneeze, your heart stops and you die temporarily.

17:30.800 --> 17:31.360
Like your heart stops.

17:31.360 --> 17:32.480
You die for a second.

17:32.480 --> 17:33.040
You can't...

17:33.040 --> 17:37.360
Your heart can't beat while you're sneezing, so it stops for a second.

17:37.920 --> 17:38.320
Okay.

17:38.320 --> 17:41.360
And people say bless you in case it doesn't start back up again.

17:41.360 --> 17:48.320
So then if you die, A, you get to go to heaven, and B, when you get there, you have super abilities.

17:48.320 --> 17:50.800
That's also why anytime anyone sneezes, I yell.

17:50.800 --> 17:51.840
I get a stereo.

17:52.720 --> 17:52.960
Yes.

17:54.880 --> 17:57.680
I just Wikipedia'd it.

17:57.680 --> 18:00.640
There are apparently differing definitions.

18:00.640 --> 18:01.600
That's one of them, though.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.040
I don't think that people...

18:03.040 --> 18:06.560
I mean, people were like supes dumb back in the day.

18:06.560 --> 18:09.360
I understand that, but I don't think they ever thought...

18:09.360 --> 18:12.560
I don't think they were ever wacky enough to think that when you sneeze,

18:12.560 --> 18:14.480
a little bit of the devil jumps out of you.

18:14.480 --> 18:16.000
That's what they thought.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.680
Griffin, I hate to bring it to you, but that's absolutely true.

18:20.240 --> 18:20.640
Sure it is.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.960
That it was a demon escaping your body.

18:22.960 --> 18:24.560
Well, then why would they say bless you?

18:24.560 --> 18:27.360
Why wouldn't they be like, hey, you got that demon out, high five me.

18:27.360 --> 18:28.960
To keep the demon from going back in.

18:29.760 --> 18:32.880
Well, then why didn't people just like cover their nose and mouth all the time?

18:32.880 --> 18:34.320
Like to keep demons from getting in.

18:34.960 --> 18:37.360
People back in the day were so fucking dumb.

18:37.360 --> 18:38.800
They didn't know anything.

18:38.800 --> 18:39.760
They're so stoops.

18:41.360 --> 18:44.320
I think that you just say it and you take the compliment.

18:44.320 --> 18:46.720
It's like we've talked about, I think before,

18:46.720 --> 18:48.160
I don't know if we've touched on this before, but

18:50.080 --> 18:54.000
if you're a meal where someone blesses the meal as part of their culture,

18:54.560 --> 18:58.400
you don't wait till everybody has their head bowed in their silence room and go bullshit.

18:59.600 --> 19:00.080
I'm out.

19:00.880 --> 19:01.280
I'm out.

19:01.920 --> 19:10.720
Or just wait till they're in mid-prayer and then cut like a totally raunchy dude or something.

19:10.720 --> 19:11.760
You're respected.

19:11.760 --> 19:17.040
You know, you don't just disregard it if it's important to those people.

19:17.040 --> 19:18.400
And this isn't even a religious thing.

19:18.400 --> 19:22.320
It's like, who says bless you for religious reasons?

19:22.320 --> 19:26.240
Like when you sneeze, no one's moved by the Holy Spirit to say,

19:26.240 --> 19:27.840
it's just something you say.

19:27.840 --> 19:29.760
It's just a reaction.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.920
In God, we trust is written on our money.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.920
You don't like tear that up and throw it in the face of hope.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.680
How many people do you think have been converted

19:35.680 --> 19:39.520
thanks to just like a really friendly like post-sneeze like message?

19:39.520 --> 19:41.920
Like a chew, bless you.

19:41.920 --> 19:42.640
What?

19:42.640 --> 19:43.440
I've got good news.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.360
I'm glowing with the spirit.

19:47.360 --> 19:48.240
I have such good news.

19:48.240 --> 19:48.880
Well, okay.

19:48.880 --> 19:50.560
Listen, is this something we can market?

19:50.560 --> 19:52.480
Is this something we can capitalize on?

19:52.480 --> 19:58.800
Can we come up with a non-denominational like sneeze exchange that you can say

19:58.800 --> 20:04.480
that both the sneeze recipient and the sneeze sneezer can say?

20:04.480 --> 20:05.520
Let me hit you with this.

20:05.520 --> 20:10.080
What about if someone sneezes, you look them down the eye and say, you sneezed.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.200
Because that's what you're saying.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.280
When you say bless you, you're saying, hey, I caught you.

20:13.840 --> 20:14.560
Caught you sneezing.

20:14.560 --> 20:15.680
What about this one?

20:15.680 --> 20:16.480
I've seen better.

20:18.080 --> 20:21.680
Now, see, I think we need to keep any evaluation out of it

20:21.680 --> 20:23.440
because that's just going to be too complex.

20:23.440 --> 20:25.680
This needs to be something you can just like bang.

20:25.680 --> 20:27.920
Like it's something you just get out on the go on an airplane.

20:28.960 --> 20:29.840
What about gross?

20:31.280 --> 20:32.560
I kind of like that.

20:32.560 --> 20:33.440
Gross.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.480
Stop it.

20:34.480 --> 20:36.240
What about can we try yucky?

20:37.680 --> 20:39.520
Your snot's getting out.

20:39.520 --> 20:40.800
Should we keep it monosyllabic?

20:41.840 --> 20:42.560
Hanky.

20:42.560 --> 20:43.200
New hanky.

20:44.960 --> 20:45.440
Sleeve it.

20:46.240 --> 20:47.200
Sleeve it.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.080
That's good.

20:49.280 --> 20:51.520
Next time for me, sleeve it.

20:51.520 --> 20:56.000
Also, everybody knows that you're supposed to cough and sneeze into your elbow now, right?

20:56.000 --> 20:56.800
Feels weird.

20:56.800 --> 20:57.760
That's the thing to do.

20:57.760 --> 20:58.080
All right.

20:58.080 --> 21:03.040
So maybe instead of saying any one thing, we can just deliver tips to that person on how

21:03.040 --> 21:04.800
they can sneeze better.

21:04.800 --> 21:04.960
Yeah.

21:04.960 --> 21:07.600
And then we can record it for like 45 minutes.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.400
Podcast.

21:08.400 --> 21:08.640
Done.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.760
Jason, I'm going to give you one last bit of advice.

21:12.480 --> 21:17.280
The next time someone says to you, bless you, look at them and go, no, bless you.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.520
And then walk away as quickly as you can.

21:20.320 --> 21:24.640
I'm not comfortable with this war on Christmas-esque thing that's going on in this podcast.

21:24.640 --> 21:24.880
Yeah.

21:24.880 --> 21:26.160
This war on Gesundheit.

21:26.160 --> 21:33.360
You know all the blessing I need, Griffin?

21:33.360 --> 21:38.880
You need the one you do before you eat dinner at a fancy restaurant so you look impressive

21:38.880 --> 21:39.840
in front of all your friends.

21:42.720 --> 21:44.480
That's really the only one you need because it gets-

21:44.480 --> 21:46.960
Well, I also need a free trip to the money zone.

21:46.960 --> 21:56.960
What?

22:06.720 --> 22:07.440
Let's get paid.

22:08.640 --> 22:09.840
I need a better liner.

22:09.840 --> 22:14.000
The guys at Stop Podcasting Yourself, they have a fun little song they sing about paying

22:14.000 --> 22:15.440
the bills and being grown up.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.680
We sing a song at the end of our thing.

22:17.680 --> 22:18.240
That's something.

22:18.240 --> 22:19.360
And by we, I mean me.

22:20.240 --> 22:21.040
This podcast-

22:21.040 --> 22:23.920
You guys could really start pulling your weight during the jingles.

22:23.920 --> 22:26.320
This podcast is bullshit.

22:26.320 --> 22:26.640
Yep.

22:26.640 --> 22:27.280
How do I know?

22:27.840 --> 22:31.200
Because there's a much better podcast out there.

22:31.200 --> 22:35.200
There are several, but we're going to talk about one that paid us to talk about it.

22:35.200 --> 22:35.440
Yeah.

22:37.680 --> 22:38.800
That's not why we're doing it.

22:38.800 --> 22:40.240
You're ruining the fourth wall.

22:40.240 --> 22:45.680
The Lion in Tweed is the story of a college professor of economics and sound studies who

22:45.680 --> 22:47.280
plays folk music on the side.

22:47.280 --> 22:48.640
He is also a lion.

22:49.200 --> 22:53.520
I feel like that should be enough of a commercial right there because if you hear that and you

22:53.520 --> 23:01.440
don't start heading to thelionintweed.com right now, then you're a monster, I think.

23:02.720 --> 23:05.040
I like that it's pretty meta.

23:05.040 --> 23:11.520
It's an episodic musical podcast of fictionalized life, like it's made up on so many different

23:11.520 --> 23:13.840
levels about, you know, a lion.

23:13.840 --> 23:15.600
Here's one of the selling points.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.600
Here's one of the bullet points we were provided.

23:17.600 --> 23:21.840
It's a well-groomed lion stuffed into a corduroy blazer and bootcut jeans.

23:22.880 --> 23:24.560
Okay, cool.

23:24.560 --> 23:28.640
This is a skanky like threadbare lion you're used to.

23:31.280 --> 23:33.200
This isn't like a Chester Cheetah.

23:33.200 --> 23:36.400
We're not talking about like a rude dude with tons of tood.

23:36.400 --> 23:39.360
We're talking about a guy you'd invite over.

23:39.360 --> 23:42.480
This is a classy college professor that you can sit around with.

23:43.040 --> 23:49.200
You can talk about Proust and maybe once the night comes up, hit that gravity bong because

23:49.200 --> 23:50.240
you know how.

23:50.240 --> 23:51.920
You and the lion, you know how professors are.

23:51.920 --> 23:53.120
You know how college professors are.

23:53.120 --> 24:00.560
There's artwork by a Renston Roundtree of the webcomic Subnormality and it describes

24:00.560 --> 24:04.560
a new model of music on the internet with focus on the podcast as performance, kind

24:04.560 --> 24:06.400
of like what Max Fun does with comedy.

24:06.400 --> 24:07.200
I really dig that.

24:07.200 --> 24:08.880
I always think like I love music.

24:08.880 --> 24:09.680
I love podcasts.

24:09.680 --> 24:12.400
I can't listen to both at once or it's cacophonous.

24:12.960 --> 24:15.200
Yeah, it's just cacophony and they have blended the two.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.280
They blended the two together.

24:18.400 --> 24:19.920
I love this and you will too.

24:20.640 --> 24:23.120
Go to thelionandtweed.com, follow him on Twitter.

24:23.120 --> 24:30.320
He's at thelionandtweed or subscribe to the podcast on iTunes if it's just thelionandtweed.

24:30.320 --> 24:33.040
Have you listened to the first episode that's up yet?

24:33.040 --> 24:33.920
Have you listened to it?

24:35.200 --> 24:39.360
I want to know how much, I listened to a few minutes of it when I was at South by Southwest,

24:39.360 --> 24:41.280
but I didn't have time to really digest it.

24:41.280 --> 24:44.400
How much devouring goes on?

24:44.400 --> 24:47.200
Does he, how many people does he devour throughout the course?

24:47.200 --> 24:49.600
I've yet to hear any devourments, devour it.

24:50.240 --> 24:52.000
See, that seems disingenuous.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.400
Like the podcast is really great and it's doing some groundbreaking things with music,

24:56.400 --> 25:01.600
comedy fusion, but I need some wholesale devourment.

25:02.240 --> 25:09.440
Maybe they wanted to include more of that, but while they were making the website,

25:09.440 --> 25:13.520
it just got too hard or boring or maybe even frustrating.

25:14.960 --> 25:20.400
Maybe there was a lot of a bunch of weird tech issues they had to deal with.

25:20.400 --> 25:23.680
Maybe there were some problems with PHP, CSS.

25:23.680 --> 25:24.640
HTTP?

25:24.640 --> 25:26.400
I don't understand it.

25:26.400 --> 25:31.360
I don't know how any of this works, but I do know, I do know one thing, Griffin.

25:31.360 --> 25:32.160
What's that?

25:32.160 --> 25:33.680
I know how Photoshop works.

25:33.680 --> 25:34.640
Yeah, that one's easy.

25:34.640 --> 25:35.440
I'm a Photoshop.

25:35.440 --> 25:37.440
You want to put a baby's head on a man's body?

25:37.440 --> 25:38.240
I'm there.

25:38.240 --> 25:39.680
Man's head on a baby's body?

25:39.680 --> 25:40.240
I got you.

25:40.240 --> 25:42.800
Do you want to resort to grotesque surgery?

25:43.920 --> 25:48.480
Do you want to take the cover to the movie Space Jam and cut my face out and put it on

25:48.480 --> 25:51.600
the front of everybody else's faces on the cover of Space Jam?

25:51.600 --> 25:58.640
Yes, I did do that already, so don't waste your time.

25:58.640 --> 26:05.840
If you know how to use Photoshop, then you can use the Photoshop plugin called Site Grinder 3.

26:05.840 --> 26:07.200
It's made by Media Lab.

26:07.200 --> 26:12.320
Another Max Fun listener, Tom Summerall, makes this.

26:12.880 --> 26:14.000
And it is just that.

26:14.000 --> 26:20.880
It is a Photoshop plugin that lets you turn your Photoshop designs into finished websites.

26:20.880 --> 26:24.000
Real, honest-to-God websites, not just like a picture you click on.

26:24.000 --> 26:30.080
They've got content management, edit everything, e-commerce you can add, and soon you'll even

26:30.080 --> 26:32.000
be able to make WordPress themes with it, too.

26:32.000 --> 26:32.560
I know we don't.

26:32.560 --> 26:35.520
Eventually, it will become sentient and kill you in your sleep.

26:35.520 --> 26:36.480
Yeah, that's the thing.

26:36.480 --> 26:41.920
I know we don't advertise bullshit, but this sounds like some phony baloney wizardry.

26:41.920 --> 26:45.200
This sounds like a wizard who made it.

26:45.200 --> 26:47.440
That's the last bullet point, actually.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.320
Made up.

26:48.320 --> 26:49.360
Made up by a wizard.

26:49.360 --> 26:51.360
Not extant.

26:52.960 --> 26:58.640
I mean, it seems like you can't turn a Photoshop into a website.

26:58.640 --> 26:59.120
Think about it.

27:00.320 --> 27:05.200
You can't turn a fruit-by-the-foot into a digital picture frame.

27:06.560 --> 27:07.760
That's the tagline, actually.

27:07.760 --> 27:10.640
It says, hey, you dumb motherfucker, you can do this now.

27:10.640 --> 27:11.840
Hey, dumb fuck.

27:11.840 --> 27:12.960
You know how you go to websites?

27:12.960 --> 27:14.080
You're like, I remember these.

27:15.840 --> 27:16.720
That's last gen.

27:16.720 --> 27:21.680
And you can even make awesome Facebook fan pages in Photoshop.

27:21.680 --> 27:26.880
You go to medialab.com or sitegrinder.com and you can learn more about these.

27:26.880 --> 27:30.160
Or go to thelineandtweet.com if you're hopping around the net.

27:30.160 --> 27:30.640
Go to both.

27:31.200 --> 27:37.920
Treat yourself to both of these, and you might end up crafting a jingle that goes exactly like this.

27:37.920 --> 27:39.280
This is going to be tricky because I got to...

27:41.280 --> 27:44.480
Have a jingle that goes just like this.

27:44.480 --> 27:45.520
Gotta mash them up.

27:45.520 --> 27:46.800
This is a mashup.

27:46.800 --> 27:48.080
I'm trying to lead you in here.

27:48.080 --> 27:48.640
I want to give you one more time.

27:48.640 --> 27:49.360
There's a mashup.

27:50.320 --> 27:50.880
Girl talk.

28:02.160 --> 28:02.660
Shit.

28:02.660 --> 28:15.700
TheLionInTweet is a friend indeed, and he's also a podcast too.

28:15.700 --> 28:15.940
Shit.

28:15.940 --> 28:16.580
No, fuck.

28:16.580 --> 28:17.060
Lost it.

28:17.780 --> 28:18.660
All right, that's a good start.

28:18.660 --> 28:19.380
Here we go.

28:19.380 --> 28:27.700
TheLionInTweet is a friend indeed, and he's also a podcast too.

28:27.700 --> 28:38.580
And a lion in time is a fine feline, but don't let him devour you.

28:42.260 --> 28:43.460
I gotta do something about Media Lab.

28:43.460 --> 28:57.060
I made a photoshop with me and my best friend Michael Jordan.

28:59.380 --> 29:05.140
Actually, it was me and Michael Jordan and the cast of Space Jam.

29:05.780 --> 29:08.260
It was called Me and Space Jam.

29:08.980 --> 29:10.020
I gotta do another verse.

29:10.020 --> 29:12.820
That's the second verse we actually talk about the shit.

29:12.820 --> 29:14.340
Didn't even mention a thing.

29:14.340 --> 29:15.060
All right, here we go.

29:17.620 --> 29:32.420
I took me and Space Jam and I turned it into a website using Media Lab's site grinder technology.

29:32.420 --> 29:43.220
You can visit it, visit it, visit it at griffonspacejam.com.

29:50.740 --> 29:52.260
That was the worst.

29:52.260 --> 29:54.740
For fear of dwelling too long in the buddy zone.

29:54.740 --> 29:56.100
I have done so many of those.

29:56.100 --> 30:01.700
Griffin, what exactly is the website for?

30:01.700 --> 30:06.980
What are you doing there at your Space Jam website?

30:06.980 --> 30:09.540
Oh, is it just for your Space Jam fan fiction?

30:09.540 --> 30:12.980
It's a story about me and Michael Jordan.

30:16.420 --> 30:18.100
Listen, I got on a hot streak.

30:18.100 --> 30:23.380
I was trying to find the exit off of that musical highway and I missed it.

30:23.380 --> 30:26.820
And then I just had to keep going on the Michael Jordan Express.

30:27.540 --> 30:29.060
You had no other choice.

30:29.060 --> 30:30.100
What could you do?

30:30.100 --> 30:34.660
Jesus, oh, man, I'm going there right now, griffonspacejam.com.

30:34.660 --> 30:38.100
So thanks to our friends for helping us to support the show.

30:38.100 --> 30:41.540
If you want to support the show and this and who wouldn't?

30:41.540 --> 30:43.140
And Griffin's side projects.

30:43.140 --> 30:45.860
Good luck getting that jingle into a commercial, by the way.

30:45.860 --> 30:48.180
It's going to be like four minutes long.

30:48.180 --> 30:52.020
Yeah, it's email Teresa at maximumfun.org.

30:52.020 --> 30:53.060
That's Teresa with an H.

30:53.780 --> 30:56.900
My friends never wash their hands after using the bathroom.

30:56.900 --> 30:58.980
We usually get together and play video games.

30:58.980 --> 31:03.700
So the thought of unwashed hands touching communal controllers is disgusting.

31:03.700 --> 31:08.820
I know they don't because when I go to use it, the soap hasn't been touched and the sink is always dry.

31:08.820 --> 31:12.820
Also, it's pretty obvious when you hear the flush and they walk straight out.

31:12.820 --> 31:17.060
I hesitate to call them out on it because I don't want to embarrass them by asking them to do so.

31:17.060 --> 31:21.140
Is there any way my friends can be encouraged to wash their genital germs off their hands?

31:21.700 --> 31:24.900
I'm about to start wearing gloves to our hangouts.

31:24.900 --> 31:30.100
Phil, Phil, first of all, I just want to celebrate the detective work that you're doing.

31:30.100 --> 31:31.460
Yeah, way to go there, Monk.

31:33.620 --> 31:36.180
Hey, get back from hosting Double Dare.

31:39.700 --> 31:40.980
I would just call them on it.

31:41.700 --> 31:43.940
I'd be like, hey, gross, how'd you wash your hands?

31:46.180 --> 31:47.780
I think you don't want to be that guy.

31:47.780 --> 31:49.380
I would say put a sign up.

31:50.100 --> 31:53.140
Put a sign up on the bathroom door that says, hey, did you wash your hands?

31:53.140 --> 31:56.820
All Phil's friends are required to wash hands before returning to game.

31:57.780 --> 31:58.980
This means you, Derek.

32:00.660 --> 32:03.860
Yeah, that way if you don't single them out, they can think it's somebody else,

32:03.860 --> 32:06.500
but they can also be your mind to actually do it.

32:08.340 --> 32:10.900
A nice sign would be good.

32:10.900 --> 32:11.620
Let's trick them.

32:11.620 --> 32:14.340
Maybe like an electric shock collar.

32:15.380 --> 32:16.660
Oh, you know what?

32:16.660 --> 32:20.580
What if you got some celebrities to help you?

32:20.580 --> 32:24.740
And in this case, by celebrities, I mean us, who are celebrities

32:24.740 --> 32:26.260
in the limited definition of our program.

32:26.260 --> 32:27.060
Hey, Dirty.

32:27.060 --> 32:28.420
Hey, Dirty Hands.

32:28.420 --> 32:31.460
Hey, Dirty, you want to wash them up for me?

32:32.500 --> 32:33.620
There, Dirty.

32:33.620 --> 32:36.660
Make that your ringtone so you just play it for them whenever they come out of the bathroom.

32:36.660 --> 32:37.060
Hey, Dirty.

32:37.060 --> 32:38.820
It's Justin McElroy from My Brother, My Brother and Me.

32:38.820 --> 32:41.060
Wash your hands, Dirty.

32:42.260 --> 32:43.380
Lick your hand right now.

32:43.380 --> 32:46.100
Bet you won't do it because you know what's going on there.

32:47.460 --> 32:50.340
The one study I'd need science to do for me.

32:50.340 --> 32:51.940
Science is wasting their time with a lot of stuff.

32:51.940 --> 32:56.260
The one study I want to see is how often people wash their hands

32:56.980 --> 33:00.180
when they're alone in the bathroom in like a communal public bathroom

33:00.180 --> 33:03.700
and how many wash their hands when there's people in there.

33:03.700 --> 33:06.900
It's got to be like 100% different, right?

33:06.900 --> 33:09.540
Did you guys used to hate washing your hands?

33:10.900 --> 33:14.740
I used to like not appreciate the act of and so I'd like, you know,

33:14.740 --> 33:16.500
stick my hands under the water for like two seconds

33:16.500 --> 33:19.060
so then flick, mud the water on the mirror.

33:19.060 --> 33:23.620
I used, no joke, I used to hate washing my hands to the extent that when I would,

33:24.180 --> 33:25.860
this was a long time ago.

33:25.860 --> 33:29.140
I now understand the value of a good hand wash

33:30.420 --> 33:32.660
but I used to just turn the water on

33:33.380 --> 33:36.660
and then turn it off to make people think I wash my hands.

33:36.660 --> 33:38.340
I was literally doing,

33:39.700 --> 33:43.700
I was exerting as much energy as was required to wash my hands

33:43.700 --> 33:48.980
but in defiance of societal laws, I didn't go through with the act.

33:48.980 --> 33:52.020
I tell you, if a bathroom has a Dyson Airblade,

33:52.020 --> 33:55.540
I'm about 90 times more likely to wash my hands because I love it.

33:55.540 --> 33:58.580
Yeah, let's make washing hands fun again.

33:58.580 --> 34:00.820
Yeah, thanks Dyson for doing that.

34:00.820 --> 34:02.660
Here's the thing that you could do, Phil.

34:03.540 --> 34:06.820
What if you started covering the inside doorknob to your bathroom

34:06.820 --> 34:10.340
and some sort of unsavory material?

34:10.340 --> 34:15.460
I don't know what it might be, maple syrup.

34:15.460 --> 34:17.940
Because nobody wants to smell a maple syrup on their hands, right?

34:17.940 --> 34:21.140
Like that's a bad smell to carry around with you all day.

34:21.140 --> 34:24.180
So cover the inside doorknob and they touch it, maple syrup hands.

34:24.180 --> 34:25.940
Oh, gotta wash them anyway.

34:25.940 --> 34:28.100
You know what, try this.

34:28.100 --> 34:31.060
Buy a new kind of like really fragrant hand soap

34:31.060 --> 34:32.500
and then when they come out, say,

34:33.060 --> 34:34.740
hey, did you check out the new hand soap?

34:34.740 --> 34:36.660
Do you think that it smells good or smells bad?

34:36.660 --> 34:38.100
Or I don't know if I like it or not.

34:38.100 --> 34:41.300
And then you're not calling them out, but they get all embarrassed

34:41.300 --> 34:43.860
because they didn't use any soap because they didn't wash their hands.

34:43.860 --> 34:44.500
This is good.

34:44.500 --> 34:48.660
I think you gotta call them out because that's gonna last for like a minute.

34:48.660 --> 34:50.740
The pain, the anguish of embarrassment.

34:50.740 --> 34:54.100
It's only gonna last for a little bit, but the last one will last a lifetime.

34:54.660 --> 34:58.260
Yeah, and try to do it just one on one.

34:58.260 --> 34:59.220
I'm not, who am I kidding?

34:59.220 --> 35:00.260
He's not gonna do that.

35:00.260 --> 35:00.820
This is also-

35:00.820 --> 35:01.780
He's not gonna talk to him about it.

35:01.780 --> 35:02.740
Excuse me, Derek.

35:02.740 --> 35:04.180
Can I speak to you over here for a minute?

35:04.180 --> 35:05.540
Can I speak in the kitchen, Derek?

35:05.540 --> 35:08.020
Derek, we've known each other for a long time now.

35:08.660 --> 35:09.460
We're friends, right?

35:10.420 --> 35:13.860
I have a weird question that I'm not even sure we need to answer,

35:14.500 --> 35:17.780
but when I was reading it, I enjoyed it so much that I want to share it with you.

35:17.780 --> 35:18.020
Okay.

35:18.580 --> 35:18.820
Okay.

35:19.380 --> 35:21.300
I have a question that's been in my head all week.

35:21.300 --> 35:23.940
The other day, I was trying to cut through an apartment complex,

35:23.940 --> 35:26.900
the same one I usually do for a shortcut to get to the mall,

35:26.900 --> 35:29.140
and a man was walking his dog through there.

35:29.140 --> 35:30.740
When me and my buddy started walking through,

35:30.740 --> 35:33.220
the old man asked us, are you going to walk through these apartments?

35:33.220 --> 35:34.500
And we told him yes.

35:34.500 --> 35:38.420
And he said not to, because there's a man with a gun who lives there,

35:38.420 --> 35:41.460
and anyone who doesn't live there who passes by, he will shoot.

35:42.180 --> 35:45.780
I told him it was illegal because it's an apartment building and he doesn't own it.

35:45.780 --> 35:48.580
His only responses to all my questions from here on is,

35:48.580 --> 35:51.540
it's private property in a very annoying tone.

35:51.540 --> 35:54.180
We eventually left to go to the mall after 15 minutes wasted.

35:54.180 --> 35:56.900
But I've been thinking about other arguments,

35:56.900 --> 36:01.060
like what if relatives of a neighbor came by to visit and he shot them,

36:01.060 --> 36:04.420
or a Jehovah's Witness came by and his head was blown to bits,

36:04.420 --> 36:05.700
was he lying?

36:05.700 --> 36:07.780
Or is this a really scary situation?

36:07.780 --> 36:10.980
This man and the tenants who are threatening people need to be reported.

36:12.980 --> 36:14.500
I would really like it to be true,

36:14.500 --> 36:17.540
just because I want to picture the scene of like someone walking up to that guy's door

36:17.540 --> 36:18.900
and knocking like, hey, just so you know,

36:19.780 --> 36:22.100
my cousin is going to be visiting tomorrow.

36:22.100 --> 36:24.980
He's five foot two, red hair.

36:24.980 --> 36:27.940
I'll have him, you know, do the hands up and announce himself.

36:27.940 --> 36:30.180
But if you could not kill him, that would be super.

36:30.180 --> 36:34.740
Hey, can you do me this one solid and not shoot my cousin Brian?

36:34.740 --> 36:35.300
He has red hair.

36:35.300 --> 36:36.660
Please don't kill Brian on sight.

36:40.340 --> 36:42.820
You should never murder anybody, right?

36:42.820 --> 36:45.380
Like that's our number one piece of advice,

36:45.380 --> 36:46.980
is that if you're about to murder somebody,

36:46.980 --> 36:48.500
don't do it and go do something else.

36:49.700 --> 36:52.020
I don't understand why you do it for something this small.

36:52.740 --> 36:54.260
Yeah, it's a great question.

36:54.900 --> 36:57.700
Hey, I have a Yahoo answer to cleanse our palate with.

36:57.700 --> 36:58.420
Give it to me.

36:58.420 --> 37:00.100
Just kidding, it's an eHow article.

37:01.460 --> 37:02.900
Tricked you again, you dumb bitch.

37:03.700 --> 37:04.580
Got me.

37:04.580 --> 37:07.300
This one was sent in a long time ago, actually, by Jeff DeLong,

37:07.300 --> 37:09.860
but I bookmarked it and forgot about it until now.

37:12.980 --> 37:14.100
eHow article.

37:14.660 --> 37:16.100
Let me see if I can find a difficult.

37:16.100 --> 37:18.100
Oh, this one's moderately easy.

37:18.900 --> 37:19.540
Good.

37:19.540 --> 37:21.860
It makes no bigs, basically.

37:23.540 --> 37:24.340
Don't worry about it.

37:24.340 --> 37:25.540
Hey, no bigs.

37:25.540 --> 37:26.180
You got this.

37:26.180 --> 37:27.540
How to talk to aliens.

37:29.380 --> 37:31.140
When you want to talk to aliens,

37:31.140 --> 37:32.900
you need to telepathically call them.

37:33.540 --> 37:36.740
Don't yell out your window, hey, aliens, I want to talk.

37:36.740 --> 37:38.500
You probably won't get a response.

37:39.060 --> 37:41.060
You need to approach this matter seriously

37:41.060 --> 37:42.820
by following these steps.

37:42.820 --> 37:43.320
Sure.

37:43.940 --> 37:44.440
Step one.

37:45.140 --> 37:45.640
Step one.

37:46.180 --> 37:46.820
Meditate daily.

37:48.100 --> 37:49.460
Keep your thoughts pure.

37:49.460 --> 37:51.380
Like, like attracts like,

37:52.260 --> 37:54.980
and you don't want to attract any evil aliens.

37:54.980 --> 37:57.060
Focus on good, gentle aliens.

37:57.620 --> 37:58.120
Okay.

37:58.120 --> 37:59.620
Hey, who was that that was meditating

37:59.620 --> 38:02.020
and brought down these fucking surly aliens

38:02.020 --> 38:02.980
that are shooting us?

38:02.980 --> 38:03.480
ID4 stuff.

38:04.580 --> 38:06.020
Why did you meditate so hard?

38:06.020 --> 38:09.220
Why did you meditate hard on angry things like ID4 aliens?

38:12.180 --> 38:14.660
Know that aliens communicate telepathically

38:14.660 --> 38:15.700
and can hear your thoughts.

38:16.500 --> 38:18.020
Call them with clear intention.

38:18.020 --> 38:19.700
Tell them the reason you're calling them.

38:21.540 --> 38:24.180
Did you know that aliens can hear your everything?

38:24.180 --> 38:25.220
Your every thought?

38:26.580 --> 38:27.460
Every thought?

38:27.460 --> 38:30.100
Everything you think aliens are just hearing it from space

38:30.100 --> 38:31.460
and like, aw.

38:31.460 --> 38:33.540
Aliens have to be bored as shit.

38:34.340 --> 38:35.540
Quick question.

38:35.540 --> 38:36.900
Like, what are you, what are you,

38:37.620 --> 38:39.860
what is your reason for calling aliens?

38:40.660 --> 38:41.940
Think of your reason beforehand.

38:41.940 --> 38:44.260
Hey, aliens, what's up?

38:44.260 --> 38:46.740
I guess I just want to talk to aliens.

38:46.740 --> 38:48.340
I could have like a super good reason.

38:48.340 --> 38:50.500
I think the reason for calling aliens

38:50.500 --> 38:53.140
is the same reason why you'd write an eHow article

38:53.140 --> 38:54.820
about how to call aliens,

38:54.820 --> 38:57.540
and that is crippling loneliness.

38:58.500 --> 38:59.060
Right.

38:59.060 --> 38:59.540
Exactly.

39:01.380 --> 39:03.460
Anywhere in that, anywhere in that article,

39:04.100 --> 39:06.260
does it give you any steps on how

39:06.260 --> 39:08.260
or when to welcome them to Earth?

39:09.620 --> 39:10.260
Let's keep going.

39:10.260 --> 39:10.740
We'll find out.

39:11.300 --> 39:11.860
Okay.

39:11.860 --> 39:12.660
Three.

39:12.660 --> 39:14.740
Gaze at the stars from inside your home

39:14.740 --> 39:17.940
or you may want to meditate outside in your underwear.

39:18.660 --> 39:19.060
This will-

39:21.220 --> 39:22.500
It'll draw the sexy aliens.

39:22.500 --> 39:23.940
This will save them the trouble

39:23.940 --> 39:25.220
of having to remove your clothes

39:25.220 --> 39:26.420
so they try to abduct you.

39:26.980 --> 39:27.780
Excuse me?

39:27.780 --> 39:28.420
No, stop, guys.

39:28.420 --> 39:29.140
What?

39:29.140 --> 39:31.860
No explanation provided nor required.

39:33.540 --> 39:33.940
Really?

39:35.380 --> 39:36.420
Does it say that?

39:36.420 --> 39:37.220
Hey, there he is.

39:37.220 --> 39:39.060
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be straight up with you.

39:39.060 --> 39:42.020
If anyone ever tries to abduct me into space

39:42.020 --> 39:42.820
and they're like,

39:42.820 --> 39:45.060
oh shit, he forgot to take his clothes off,

39:45.060 --> 39:46.900
you're, yes, that's what I want.

39:46.900 --> 39:48.580
I don't want to make it easier for them

39:49.140 --> 39:50.340
to abduct me into space.

39:50.340 --> 39:50.660
Yeah.

39:50.660 --> 39:52.100
They'll dissect me and shit.

39:52.100 --> 39:53.940
I wasn't gonna go to Earth tonight,

39:53.940 --> 39:55.380
but if you look at Dylan down there,

39:55.380 --> 39:56.980
I think he's ready for biz.

39:56.980 --> 39:57.860
Like, you look at him,

39:58.900 --> 40:00.260
he is DTF.

40:00.260 --> 40:01.140
Dylan is down.

40:01.700 --> 40:04.580
Is it just me or has Dylan oiled himself up?

40:04.580 --> 40:06.100
Well, that'll make it way easier.

40:06.100 --> 40:08.100
He is D-T-B-A.

40:08.100 --> 40:08.900
Let's get him.

40:11.380 --> 40:12.180
Oh, man.

40:13.140 --> 40:14.580
But see, you make it too easy for them.

40:14.580 --> 40:15.220
They don't like it.

40:16.980 --> 40:20.500
Aliens, sex aliens, they love the chase.

40:21.300 --> 40:21.940
Oh, yeah.

40:21.940 --> 40:24.660
They also love little guys named Chase.

40:24.660 --> 40:27.060
So your name's Chase and you're out there.

40:28.180 --> 40:29.300
They're into it.

40:29.300 --> 40:31.780
Persist in your daily meditation call

40:31.780 --> 40:33.460
and eventually you will get results.

40:33.460 --> 40:34.820
When the aliens appear,

40:34.820 --> 40:36.340
you don't need to shake their hands

40:36.340 --> 40:37.300
or introduce yourself.

40:37.300 --> 40:39.060
They already know who you are.

40:39.060 --> 40:40.100
They just want to fuck.

40:40.100 --> 40:41.460
That seems-

40:41.460 --> 40:42.740
Also, they can read your mind

40:42.740 --> 40:44.500
and tell that you didn't wash your hands,

40:44.500 --> 40:45.380
you dirty fuck.

40:46.020 --> 40:48.260
Listen, this seems like a pretty big gamble to take

40:48.260 --> 40:50.580
because if the aliens don't know who you are,

40:50.580 --> 40:52.900
you are naked and also pretty rude.

40:55.300 --> 40:56.740
Hey, we don't need names, do we?

40:57.620 --> 40:58.260
Yeah, I guess.

40:58.260 --> 40:59.540
Like, I'm an alien.

40:59.540 --> 41:00.740
This earthling,

41:00.740 --> 41:05.860
this earthling Chase0115 is nude and rude

41:05.860 --> 41:06.980
and totally crude.

41:08.100 --> 41:09.220
He's a bad dude.

41:09.220 --> 41:10.820
He's a bad dude with tude.

41:11.380 --> 41:11.940
Let's get him.

41:11.940 --> 41:13.540
I think we should wipe this planet.

41:13.540 --> 41:14.740
Let's get him.

41:14.740 --> 41:15.860
Let's firewiper.

41:15.860 --> 41:16.500
Let's fuck.

41:16.500 --> 41:18.740
Let's get him telepathically.

41:18.740 --> 41:21.540
I'm a fuck you ID4 style.

41:24.500 --> 41:27.220
I'm a fuck you like Trent Spiner.

41:27.220 --> 41:27.940
Is that his name?

41:30.900 --> 41:31.540
Trent.

41:31.540 --> 41:32.500
A Brent Spiner.

41:33.780 --> 41:35.220
His brother is Trent though.

41:36.900 --> 41:37.700
If I was an alien,

41:37.700 --> 41:40.420
he'd be the first one against the wall getting fucked.

41:41.940 --> 41:43.700
Okay, Trent Spiner would?

41:43.700 --> 41:44.580
I'm just saying.

41:44.580 --> 41:45.620
I would teach him

41:45.620 --> 41:46.820
because it would be really ironic

41:46.820 --> 41:49.140
because he gets absolutely perforated

41:49.140 --> 41:50.420
by aliens in ID4.

41:51.220 --> 41:52.020
So yeah, right.

41:52.020 --> 41:54.260
People like they already know how he how he does.

41:54.820 --> 41:56.100
How they how to get him.

41:56.100 --> 41:57.060
He likes it.

41:57.060 --> 41:57.700
How Brent likes it.

41:57.700 --> 41:58.900
He likes it and serving.

41:58.900 --> 41:59.140
Yeah.

41:59.940 --> 42:01.140
Of course, they're not going to bother

42:01.140 --> 42:02.820
if he's not already outside and naked

42:02.820 --> 42:03.780
and praying to them.

42:04.340 --> 42:05.380
And lubed.

42:05.380 --> 42:08.100
Cooperate with the aliens at all times.

42:08.100 --> 42:10.340
They get angry if you don't take their advice

42:10.340 --> 42:11.460
or do what they tell you.

42:11.460 --> 42:13.140
They may look spindly,

42:13.140 --> 42:17.140
but they can easily control you.

42:17.140 --> 42:18.020
Can they?

42:18.020 --> 42:20.740
This person's got a pretty robust knowledge

42:20.740 --> 42:22.420
of what these aliens are into.

42:22.420 --> 42:23.060
Listen, these aliens.

42:23.060 --> 42:24.420
They can easily control me.

42:24.420 --> 42:25.220
Why are they worried about

42:25.220 --> 42:26.660
if my clothes are off yet or not?

42:27.940 --> 42:28.900
They want to see me strip?

42:30.100 --> 42:32.980
Yeah, it's actually incredibly unsexy for them

42:32.980 --> 42:34.100
because they don't wear clothes.

42:34.100 --> 42:34.900
They don't understand.

42:34.900 --> 42:37.780
Oh, they don't wear armor.

42:37.780 --> 42:38.660
They see armor.

42:38.660 --> 42:39.620
They see they're like,

42:39.620 --> 42:41.940
why doesn't this guy have natural chitin

42:41.940 --> 42:43.220
emerging from the skin?

42:43.220 --> 42:45.220
They get angry and they lose their boners.

42:45.220 --> 42:46.580
And then you don't want to be up there

42:46.580 --> 42:47.940
when they lose their boners.

42:47.940 --> 42:49.140
That boner is the only thing

42:49.140 --> 42:50.740
keeping you alive in space.

42:53.620 --> 42:54.820
Also, it's in their hand,

42:54.820 --> 42:57.780
which makes E.T. seem way different now.

42:57.780 --> 42:59.620
Talk with the aliens telepathically.

42:59.620 --> 43:00.980
Don't say words in your mind.

43:00.980 --> 43:02.900
Use symbols to communicate your ideas.

43:03.700 --> 43:04.740
Yeah, thanks.

43:04.740 --> 43:06.660
Now they will easy to control my thoughts.

43:06.660 --> 43:09.140
Yeah, my symbol is going to be a stop sign

43:09.140 --> 43:10.740
because I'm being fucked by an alien

43:10.740 --> 43:12.980
and I want it to stop, please.

43:12.980 --> 43:14.100
Please stop.

43:14.100 --> 43:15.620
I don't even bother telling them what to do.

43:17.140 --> 43:18.820
So yeah, what does it matter?

43:18.820 --> 43:20.820
Like, I think that your path's pretty well set

43:20.820 --> 43:22.100
once you ask them to come down.

43:22.820 --> 43:23.780
Hey, P.S.

43:23.780 --> 43:24.980
Did these rules change

43:24.980 --> 43:27.700
if you accidentally beamed down the angry aliens?

43:27.700 --> 43:29.540
Like, should you submiss as hard

43:29.540 --> 43:30.500
as they're telling you to?

43:31.220 --> 43:32.100
Oh, so you're saying

43:32.100 --> 43:33.620
if we beamed down ID4 aliens,

43:33.620 --> 43:36.020
then we have an ID4-esque revolt against them.

43:36.020 --> 43:38.340
If we beamed down sexians.

43:38.340 --> 43:41.540
What I'm saying is this guide should probably branch

43:41.540 --> 43:42.260
a little bit.

43:42.260 --> 43:44.740
There should be some limited branching

43:44.740 --> 43:47.540
between if it's an angry alien or a cool alien.

43:47.540 --> 43:50.260
I like the idea that every other species,

43:50.260 --> 43:53.060
every other alien race in the galaxy,

43:53.060 --> 43:55.380
except human beings, can hear thoughts.

43:55.380 --> 43:59.140
Like, so they're up there just waiting for someone on Earth

43:59.140 --> 44:00.660
to call them down naked

44:01.540 --> 44:02.820
and then come down and just fuck the shit up.

44:02.820 --> 44:03.540
I'm ready.

44:04.100 --> 44:05.940
I just watched Earth Girls Are Easy.

44:05.940 --> 44:06.900
Let's get it wet.

44:06.900 --> 44:07.620
Let's get it wet.

44:10.740 --> 44:12.260
I just want to point out that both movies

44:12.260 --> 44:13.860
we've referenced in this conversation

44:13.860 --> 44:15.380
have both starred Jeff Goldblum.

44:15.380 --> 44:18.420
Jeff Goldblum knows about fucking and fighting aliens.

44:20.820 --> 44:22.740
Right in their ship, if you like.

44:22.740 --> 44:23.780
I can't do this anymore.

44:23.780 --> 44:25.700
Right in their ship, if you like.

44:25.700 --> 44:26.980
I don't think you have a choice.

44:26.980 --> 44:27.220
If they put you on there, you're-

44:27.220 --> 44:28.740
You may not have a choice, it says.

44:29.620 --> 44:30.420
You may not have a choice.

44:30.420 --> 44:30.900
No shit.

44:30.900 --> 44:32.580
You can't do anything they don't tell you to do.

44:32.580 --> 44:34.500
Hey, aliens, you just fucked me,

44:34.500 --> 44:35.860
and it was really bad.

44:35.860 --> 44:36.820
Um, can you-

44:36.820 --> 44:38.420
My house is just that way.

44:38.420 --> 44:39.060
If- No.

44:39.060 --> 44:40.020
Oh, we're going-

44:40.020 --> 44:40.900
We're going to-

44:40.900 --> 44:41.620
Oh, you're gonna have-

44:41.620 --> 44:42.660
Fuck me on Uranus.

44:42.660 --> 44:43.380
That's very funny.

44:44.180 --> 44:44.820
That's really-

44:44.820 --> 44:46.900
That's a really good goof and a hot spoof.

44:50.420 --> 44:52.260
It's a pretty good spoof, aliens.

44:52.260 --> 44:53.060
Can I go home?

44:54.020 --> 44:55.060
Are you gonna kill me?

44:55.060 --> 44:57.380
This is nothing like Flight of the Navigator.

44:57.380 --> 44:58.580
This hurts-

44:58.580 --> 44:59.860
This hurts everywhere.

44:59.860 --> 45:02.020
I'm picturing a picture of me dead.

45:02.020 --> 45:04.660
I'm picturing the symbol of me dying.

45:04.660 --> 45:06.420
Can you do that, please?

45:08.180 --> 45:10.500
Establish an ongoing relationship with them by telling them-

45:10.500 --> 45:11.460
No, we can't.

45:11.460 --> 45:14.900
By telling them you want to participate in their breeding program.

45:15.860 --> 45:16.180
No!

45:17.540 --> 45:19.380
It sounds like you already participated.

45:19.380 --> 45:22.180
It's like you're in it to win it already.

45:22.180 --> 45:24.420
You are down with the rogue.

45:24.420 --> 45:25.700
You are ready.

45:25.700 --> 45:28.900
You are on board, as much on board as you could be.

45:28.900 --> 45:33.140
You're naked and lying in your lawn and thinking about sexy cool aliens.

45:33.140 --> 45:34.980
Like, you are in it.

45:36.900 --> 45:39.140
How many symbols do these bitches need?

45:39.140 --> 45:40.580
Like, you're naked.

45:41.620 --> 45:43.540
Do they want you to gape it for them?

45:43.540 --> 45:43.780
Yeah.

45:43.780 --> 45:46.900
Do you want you to reach right there with both hands and just gape it?

45:46.900 --> 45:47.380
My symbol-

45:47.380 --> 45:50.020
Step 18, reach back, spread butt cheeks.

45:50.020 --> 45:51.540
The aliens love it.

45:51.540 --> 45:52.660
The aliens love that shit.

45:52.660 --> 45:54.900
Here's how you get an alien turned on.

45:54.900 --> 45:57.940
In your mind, sing hello by Lionel Richie.

45:59.060 --> 46:00.180
Instant alien boner.

46:01.060 --> 46:01.860
And then gape it.

46:01.860 --> 46:03.780
Um, that's all for the steps.

46:03.780 --> 46:06.740
There are some tips and warnings, including don't try to look an alien in the eye.

46:06.740 --> 46:08.020
It's almost impossible.

46:09.700 --> 46:10.260
Almost.

46:10.260 --> 46:15.380
I guess, I guess because the position that you're in, like, it'd be hard to control your body.

46:16.580 --> 46:18.740
Don't tell anyone about your talks with aliens.

46:18.740 --> 46:20.180
They'll probably think you're crazy.

46:20.180 --> 46:21.220
No shit.

46:21.220 --> 46:23.700
Don't even post on the internet about your talks with aliens.

46:23.700 --> 46:27.460
You may find yourself being followed by men in black or being posed by black helicopters.

46:28.260 --> 46:28.660
Maybe.

46:28.660 --> 46:30.340
Or the aliens will get on Facebook and be like,

46:30.340 --> 46:32.580
oh man, Robbie told about our fuck sesh.

46:32.580 --> 46:33.620
I thought that was private.

46:34.180 --> 46:36.580
I'm changing our relationship status to angry.

46:36.580 --> 46:39.620
I'm changing it from currently probing him in his butthole.

46:39.620 --> 46:42.340
I'm changing it from Earth girls are easy to ID4.

46:43.860 --> 46:44.260
Sorry.

46:44.900 --> 46:45.540
Sorry, Earth.

46:45.540 --> 46:46.900
Here comes the fire wipe.

46:46.900 --> 46:47.700
And thank you.

46:47.700 --> 46:48.820
And thank you to Dylan.

46:48.820 --> 46:49.860
We hope it was worth it.

46:51.380 --> 46:53.380
We hope you really love the probing.

46:53.380 --> 46:54.820
Um, I can't-

46:54.820 --> 46:56.820
This is, this is semi-related.

46:56.820 --> 46:59.300
When the robots finally rise up and overthrow humanity,

46:59.300 --> 47:03.700
will Anthony Daniels be given a pass for his portrayal of C-3PO in Star Wars

47:03.700 --> 47:06.980
or will said performance be seen as robot blackface?

47:06.980 --> 47:07.860
That's from Jessica.

47:10.260 --> 47:12.340
I don't know what the advice here is,

47:12.340 --> 47:13.940
but I'm going to, I'm going to, um,

47:14.980 --> 47:19.140
I'm going to pretend that she's deciding whether or not to go visit Anthony Daniels

47:19.140 --> 47:20.340
or maybe go see him perform.

47:21.940 --> 47:23.380
We can't do that.

47:23.380 --> 47:25.140
We can't remix these questions.

47:25.940 --> 47:26.900
Remix.

47:26.900 --> 47:29.140
Substep. Kyle, from that first question,

47:29.140 --> 47:31.940
he was asking about his awesome life and how to make it more awesome.

47:32.660 --> 47:32.900
Yeah.

47:34.100 --> 47:35.460
He doesn't work at Target.

47:35.460 --> 47:37.540
He works at Home Depot.

47:37.540 --> 47:38.500
I just did that.

47:39.540 --> 47:44.660
I don't think the aliens will have any love for C-3PO, the character.

47:44.660 --> 47:47.380
I think, I mean, he works for humans.

47:47.380 --> 47:50.900
I think they're going to see him as something of a, of an Uncle Tron, if you will.

47:50.900 --> 47:52.580
Oh, Justin.

47:52.580 --> 47:53.140
No?

47:53.140 --> 47:54.020
You don't think so?

47:54.020 --> 47:54.340
Maybe.

47:54.340 --> 47:56.820
It was worth a shot, I guess.

47:56.820 --> 47:59.380
I'll give you a guffaw, but that's it.

47:59.380 --> 48:01.620
That's all you're getting for this situation.

48:01.620 --> 48:03.140
I will give you half a chuckle.

48:03.140 --> 48:04.420
I will give you a chuckle.

48:04.420 --> 48:07.620
Listen, I can't, I can't laugh at this question

48:07.620 --> 48:11.780
because we just saw a robot run the fucking train

48:11.780 --> 48:14.420
on the best that humanity has to offer to Jeopardy and now,

48:16.580 --> 48:18.740
this isn't the future anymore, guys.

48:18.740 --> 48:20.340
This is, this is yesterday.

48:20.340 --> 48:22.340
This is like two weeks ago, whatever that Jeopardy happened.

48:22.340 --> 48:23.700
We're living in the yesterday of time.

48:23.700 --> 48:28.500
We are living in the yesterday where robots just brain fucked Ken Jennings,

48:28.500 --> 48:30.100
like got deep down in him.

48:30.740 --> 48:32.980
Like he was, he was like, as if,

48:33.940 --> 48:37.460
as if Ken Jennings were gaping like Dylan on his lawn.

48:37.460 --> 48:38.580
They just got in there.

48:38.580 --> 48:41.620
He took him to a whole nother dimension of shame.

48:43.460 --> 48:45.860
He beat Ken Jennings so hard at Jeopardy,

48:45.860 --> 48:47.540
Ken Jennings is now impotent.

48:47.540 --> 48:48.340
That's true.

48:48.980 --> 48:49.780
He can't reproduce.

48:49.780 --> 48:52.420
Right after he finished, right after he finished with Ken Jennings' brain,

48:52.420 --> 48:53.860
he shot off an EMP.

48:53.860 --> 48:54.980
Both players are EMP.

48:54.980 --> 48:56.500
I can't even remember the other guy's name

48:56.500 --> 48:58.740
because his existence has been wiped from history.

48:59.380 --> 49:01.300
He did that because he's a fucking computer.

49:02.180 --> 49:04.820
I, I think that this, it's not a joke.

49:04.820 --> 49:07.620
I, if, if there's, if there's a God in heaven above,

49:07.620 --> 49:10.500
Anthony Daniels will be dead by the time the robot revelations.

49:10.500 --> 49:14.180
Oh, they will desecrate Anthony Daniels.

49:14.980 --> 49:16.420
They'll probably dig him up,

49:16.420 --> 49:19.700
reanimating with cyborg parts and then crucify him.

49:19.700 --> 49:22.500
It will be brutal.

49:22.500 --> 49:22.820
All right.

49:22.820 --> 49:25.380
Well, listen, I want to hear Griffin's last question,

49:25.380 --> 49:28.180
but first just real quick housekeeping things.

49:29.060 --> 49:31.540
mbnbam.com is our website.

49:31.540 --> 49:33.380
There you can find out how to ask us questions,

49:33.380 --> 49:37.380
but spoiler, you just mbnbam at maximum fun.org.

49:38.340 --> 49:42.420
Thank you again for, for supporting the show.

49:42.420 --> 49:44.180
If you donated, look for your gifts.

49:44.180 --> 49:46.500
I think in the next six weeks or so,

49:46.500 --> 49:48.180
just keep an eye out on the mail.

49:48.180 --> 49:51.140
You know, we got a lot to send out, but keep an eye on.

49:51.140 --> 49:53.060
Definitely know if you got like a tote bag or something,

49:53.060 --> 49:53.860
let us know when it comes in,

49:53.860 --> 49:57.300
send us a fancy picture of yourself wearing it

49:57.300 --> 49:58.500
and carrying items in it.

50:00.340 --> 50:03.940
If you want to tweet about the show,

50:03.940 --> 50:05.860
make sure you use the mbnbam hashtag.

50:05.860 --> 50:08.260
We'll see like quotes and stuff like that.

50:08.260 --> 50:11.460
People are always really, really nice

50:11.460 --> 50:12.900
about spreading the word that way.

50:15.060 --> 50:17.220
We got a question this week from Stephanie,

50:17.220 --> 50:18.660
who said she loves the show,

50:18.660 --> 50:20.260
but the boyfriend showed it to me

50:20.260 --> 50:22.740
and always keeps his comedy sources a secret,

50:22.740 --> 50:24.020
but she wants to tell people about it.

50:24.020 --> 50:24.980
He won't let her.

50:24.980 --> 50:27.860
So I say, go to Twitter, go to in person,

50:27.860 --> 50:29.940
burn a CD and just hand it to someone.

50:29.940 --> 50:32.100
Say, here, here, this is for you.

50:32.100 --> 50:32.900
I got this for you.

50:33.540 --> 50:35.300
Go to Facebook, just get around him.

50:35.300 --> 50:36.820
You guys spread the word, it's the most important thing.

50:36.820 --> 50:38.980
I want to drop some, I want to drop some shout outs

50:39.540 --> 50:41.860
to all the people I met in Austin.

50:41.860 --> 50:45.380
We did a quick impromptu South by Southwest meetup,

50:45.380 --> 50:47.620
me and Jordan Morris from Jordan and Jesse Go did,

50:47.620 --> 50:49.380
and it was a good time.

50:49.380 --> 50:50.020
It was a fun time.

50:51.380 --> 50:54.820
The world's best people is what they call Austin.

50:54.820 --> 50:57.700
Austin, we got the world's best people, they said,

50:57.700 --> 50:59.060
and it's true, I know it.

50:59.780 --> 51:00.820
I know it as a fact.

51:02.100 --> 51:03.780
You know it deep down in your heart?

51:03.780 --> 51:05.140
I know it deep down in my heart.

51:05.140 --> 51:08.500
World's best pizza, I meant to say people,

51:08.500 --> 51:10.100
but also our pizza's pretty good too.

51:11.060 --> 51:12.900
Thanks to everybody spreading the word on Twitter.

51:12.900 --> 51:17.940
Thanks to Dorian Burn, Ghost211, tons of people out there.

51:18.980 --> 51:21.060
Matthew Vose is out there.

51:22.100 --> 51:23.220
Also Matthew Modine.

51:25.220 --> 51:25.860
Lots of people.

51:26.420 --> 51:28.820
Andy Volhop, everybody, everybody on Twitter

51:28.820 --> 51:29.780
talking about the show.

51:29.780 --> 51:30.420
Pussy Lake.

51:31.300 --> 51:36.500
Pussy Lake, all of our followers are out there

51:36.500 --> 51:37.060
spreading the word.

51:37.620 --> 51:39.540
So listen guys, thank you again.

51:39.540 --> 51:43.060
Again, have we talked about everything?

51:43.060 --> 51:44.340
Go listen to Stop Podcasting Yourself,

51:44.340 --> 51:45.860
Jordan Just To Go, Sound Young America.

51:47.380 --> 51:48.500
Just John Hodgman.

51:49.300 --> 51:50.260
A whole kit and caboodle.

51:50.980 --> 51:52.740
And thank you, as always, you're the best.

51:54.100 --> 51:57.300
This very final question was sent in by Christina Curtis.

51:57.300 --> 51:58.020
Thank you, Christina.

51:58.580 --> 52:01.540
It's by Yahoo Answers user Marissa Ventura, who asks,

52:01.540 --> 52:08.340
Help, my boyfriend keeps shouting Illuminati during sex.

52:08.340 --> 52:10.420
I'm Justin McElroy.

52:10.420 --> 52:11.620
I'm Travis McElroy.

52:11.620 --> 52:12.740
I'm Griffin McElroy.

52:12.740 --> 52:14.340
He's been my brother, my brother and me.

52:14.340 --> 52:15.140
Kiss your dad.

52:15.140 --> 52:33.140
Square on the lips.
