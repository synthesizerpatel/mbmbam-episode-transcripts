WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
If you change your mind

00:02.000 --> 00:08.480
Take a chance on the first in line. Honey, I'm still free. Take a chance on me

00:09.520 --> 00:11.520
If you need me

00:11.520 --> 00:18.000
I'm not gonna be around if you got no place to go when you're feeling down

00:19.680 --> 00:21.680
If you're all alone

00:21.920 --> 00:25.920
When the pretty birds have flown on the outskirts of the sea

00:26.480 --> 00:28.480
Take a chance on me

00:29.040 --> 00:31.520
But if you're all alone

00:32.080 --> 00:32.720
Let's rock

00:32.720 --> 00:34.880
Can I be questlove in this scenario?

00:35.680 --> 00:36.800
Yeah, I think so

00:36.800 --> 00:37.840
Travis who do you want to be?

00:37.840 --> 00:40.400
I don't listen to country music. I have no idea what you're talking about

00:40.400 --> 00:44.480
This is my brother my brother and me. It's an advice show for the modern era

00:44.720 --> 00:49.840
It is not a live jz concert live from times square. I can understand why you might be confused

00:50.160 --> 00:53.360
it possesses the same power and excitement and

00:54.320 --> 00:59.440
Um blue language though. Yeah, and we have the ability to sell out the garden in a day

01:00.240 --> 01:02.240
We're like a young marvin

01:02.880 --> 01:08.960
Yeah, his head, you know, don't worry about it. Yep. Um, so this is uh, not a jz concert

01:08.960 --> 01:12.160
it's my brother my brother me if I show for the modern era we take your

01:12.640 --> 01:14.160
uh

01:14.160 --> 01:16.640
Your queries and now can we like turn them into wisdom?

01:17.360 --> 01:18.480
um

01:18.480 --> 01:22.960
Griffin, why don't you uh hit us with a question that we can advise someone on sure. Um,

01:25.280 --> 01:27.280
An anonymous user on form spring asks

01:27.440 --> 01:32.240
I've been with my current girlfriend for around three months and feel more attracted to other women than to her

01:32.640 --> 01:34.640
What would you advise I do?

01:34.640 --> 01:36.640
Wow, do you need help with this one?

01:36.640 --> 01:43.760
Wow, how out of touch with your feelings are you three months another girl and I haven't seen my girlfriend in three weeks

01:44.320 --> 01:50.160
Are we still together? I think what you need to do is definitely stay in that relationship for the next 10 to 20 years

01:50.480 --> 01:52.880
Maybe marry her have a couple kids with her

01:53.200 --> 01:57.680
Yeah, really number one number one get her pregnant because

01:58.240 --> 02:01.920
I think that's gonna really clear up a lot of the problems that you guys have in your relationship

02:01.920 --> 02:09.360
Well, you know, I'm always three months sexier the three months responsibility the three month hump is when things really start to get long in the tooth

02:09.680 --> 02:17.120
Um, I think after three months, I don't think any relationship can really remain fresh, you know things start to go stale

02:17.760 --> 02:19.760
uh right around 10 weeks, so

02:21.040 --> 02:22.400
You know

02:22.400 --> 02:27.840
Just you you have to realize that that's an aspect that every relationship has to deal with every you can't beat yourself up

02:27.840 --> 02:33.360
Is what griffin's saying when you're when you stop being attracted to somebody fight through it

02:33.920 --> 02:39.280
Yeah, because eventually you're gonna have it. Yeah get her pregnant and then eventually you're gonna find you have begrudging respect

02:39.760 --> 02:45.760
Yeah, nothing is more attractive than begrudging respect. That's that's true. That always that's that's sexy

02:46.800 --> 02:48.800
that's how uh, that's how

02:49.200 --> 02:54.800
Russell crowe got so far is it he's begrudgingly respectful of the women he meets and and it's and it's

02:54.800 --> 03:00.260
hyper sexual and it's also important that you cheat on her as much as possible just

03:00.900 --> 03:05.220
Seven eight times a day as much as you can physically stand because that's good for her

03:05.540 --> 03:08.900
It's not about you. She wants you to be happy and that'll make her happy

03:09.540 --> 03:10.980
Yeah

03:10.980 --> 03:12.660
if you love them

03:12.660 --> 03:16.980
Cheat on them and then if they come back to you it was meant to be that's like the old saying goes

03:17.540 --> 03:21.540
Mm-hmm. By the way, this is one of those times where we're giving really bad fake advice

03:21.540 --> 03:26.500
If you don't want to follow it, yeah, uh, let's give real advice get out

03:26.980 --> 03:32.180
Yeah, that's why we went with the fake advice first because the real advice is boring get out

03:33.380 --> 03:35.220
Run take the money and run

03:35.220 --> 03:40.900
Take the money and run but whatever you do do not tell her what you just told us. Yeah

03:41.700 --> 03:47.540
Don't end it like that. Listen, honey. It's not me. It's you you are not as attractive to me as other women are

03:47.540 --> 03:51.700
Yeah, this is for your own good. Yeah, I guess in that it is. Yeah

03:52.420 --> 03:56.900
Don't blame yourself blame every other woman for being more attractive than you are

03:57.860 --> 04:03.760
For being sexy unless unless the other women he's talking about are like Uma Thurman

04:04.740 --> 04:10.580
Yeah, dude. Yeah, dude. Look at yourself in the mirror. Yeah. Hey, maybe you should take inventory real quick

04:10.580 --> 04:14.580
Like go look in the mirror is your grill. Whack. Are your pecs Waylon?

04:14.580 --> 04:22.100
Like are you gonna be able to get these girls that that that you're more attracted to like you need to really make sure

04:22.100 --> 04:23.060
you're in a

04:23.060 --> 04:28.660
mental state where you're like that may be irrelevant like that may not have any relation to what your

04:29.140 --> 04:34.340
What your situation is you may find other women attractive, but that doesn't mean like like you realize some girls get paid

04:34.340 --> 04:36.340
Do that right to look attractive?

04:36.340 --> 04:41.640
Like professionally this this six and a half that you're with might be the best you can do

04:41.640 --> 04:47.840
Yeah, unless you go whale on those pecs some more blast your core whale on your pecs get some peck juice

04:49.120 --> 04:54.260
Yeah, and then you'll be ready to go. So I guess what we're saying is look at your life and then settle

04:54.720 --> 05:00.640
There we go that all I think I need all of our advice boils down to that that one central thesis

05:01.280 --> 05:02.880
Just settle

05:02.880 --> 05:07.000
Recently, I was in a situation. This is from Ramsey via Gmail recently

05:07.000 --> 05:10.040
I was in a situation where I was provoked at a large public sporting event

05:10.040 --> 05:13.480
There was some unkind words exchange and I was asked to stand up and fight

05:13.480 --> 05:16.480
I was certainly up for it after how annoying the guy was towards me

05:16.600 --> 05:22.120
But given I was outnumbered surrounded by 50 police officers as well as being with a new peace-loving friend. I

05:22.960 --> 05:24.960
Decided to just grip my teeth and move away

05:26.320 --> 05:31.640
Yes, that's always the right answer oh that's her 19 I've noticed that as I get older I'm putting more of these

05:32.280 --> 05:34.520
Types of situations even when keeping to myself

05:34.520 --> 05:40.080
So I ask you should I man up and attempt to take out the next schmo that goes off with me or should I?

05:40.080 --> 05:42.080
continue to back off

05:42.760 --> 05:45.460
Well Ramsey us McElroy's are lovers not fighters

05:46.520 --> 05:49.800
Well, we weren't really caught into violence don't cotton to it

05:51.280 --> 05:56.680
Yeah, I've only been in one fight in my life and it was when a someone cut in the Foursquare line

05:57.120 --> 06:01.360
I've told this story before and I I spoke up and I got slapped in my face

06:01.360 --> 06:04.560
It was such a powerful slap that I fell down to the ground

06:07.320 --> 06:12.560
My advice is balance out your new peace-loving friend with a really shit balls crazy friend. Yeah

06:13.400 --> 06:17.080
And that way you won't have to do anything you can just sit there and look at like Frank

06:17.080 --> 06:23.360
I don't know about this guy, and then there Frank goes set off like a match killing that dude. Yeah, Frank

06:23.360 --> 06:25.360
This guy was looking at this weird

06:26.240 --> 06:30.000
Yeah, I I you know what I don't really think usually I

06:30.000 --> 06:33.160
I think fighting is okay to defend

06:35.920 --> 06:43.040
Like somebody you care about but other than that like ah who cares the guy you you're only 19, so let me let me

06:44.120 --> 06:49.040
Give you some guidance from somebody who's 29. He's got a decade on you if you try to fight

06:49.600 --> 06:51.400
Everybody who's an idiot?

06:51.400 --> 06:54.400
you are going to be exhausted because

06:54.400 --> 07:01.300
Most people are stupid and deserve to have their faces punched in you just can't you don't have enough punches in you

07:01.440 --> 07:03.600
For all the people that need to be literally

07:04.160 --> 07:09.760
Fucking punched in the nose like hard until it breaks and the bone goes up in their brain and kills mentally

07:09.760 --> 07:10.200
Yeah

07:10.200 --> 07:13.600
a lot of people need that treatment you have to you have to take solace in the fact that

07:13.960 --> 07:17.320
Most of those people are going to do the punching to themselves

07:18.040 --> 07:22.840
Because when you get to you know egos in the same room like that, and they're both

07:22.840 --> 07:29.520
You know drunken violent wrecks, then they're gonna mess each other up. They're gonna take care of that problem themselves. It's a it's a

07:30.480 --> 07:33.080
Self-solving problem, that's why I love watching Jersey Shore

07:33.720 --> 07:37.480
Right the problem is the solution never ever

07:39.200 --> 07:43.160
Underestimate the power of being able to feel superior to that person

07:43.280 --> 07:47.700
Yeah, right because they want to hit you and you decide not to hit them you just won

07:47.700 --> 07:52.560
You won the fight without ever throwing a blow my friend sure I like to do a little sexy harem girl

07:52.560 --> 07:56.660
Dance because yeah think about that either you're gonna defuse the situation

07:57.360 --> 08:02.200
Because he's gonna get a chuckle and everybody'll walk away friends. That's the ideal

08:02.800 --> 08:08.160
Or ultimately he's gonna slap you and it'll be that guy that hit the dancing guy

08:08.160 --> 08:13.880
Like who wants to be friends with the guy that hit that guy who was just dancing all he was doing was dancing

08:15.100 --> 08:19.280
Expressing his love through motion motion also don't go to sporting events. I might help

08:19.280 --> 08:25.680
Yeah, can I tell you why I've never gotten in a fight for real, and you should really you should take note of this Ramsey

08:25.680 --> 08:26.880
Cuz you're only 19

08:26.880 --> 08:31.600
I was always afraid like the first fight I get into like it's gonna get into 50 cuffs

08:31.600 --> 08:37.060
And then someone's gonna like punch me in my eye or like in my good eye and just pop it right out

08:38.960 --> 08:42.920
And then I won't have an eye anymore or like they'll punch me in my my sweet

08:43.400 --> 08:47.080
straight teeth and and jack up my whole grill and

08:47.080 --> 08:52.480
And that'll be the end and that'll be a thing I have to deal with for the rest of my life like they'll punch me

08:52.480 --> 08:56.520
And then I'll have an Owen Wilson nose for the rest of my life because of this one

08:57.080 --> 09:00.040
Altercation do you know why you know why I never got in a fight

09:00.040 --> 09:03.080
I was taking a stage combat class and

09:03.680 --> 09:09.360
The professor grabbed my wrist and held my fist up in the air and announced very loudly does everyone see this

09:09.940 --> 09:15.680
Travis McElroy has fists of iron if he were to ever accidentally hit someone he would kill them

09:15.680 --> 09:18.900
Yeah, so I've lived in fear that the first time I punch

09:19.980 --> 09:21.980
Their eye out

09:22.140 --> 09:27.500
Straight up kill them well Travis you've been in more fights than than all of us cuz I remember one time in middle school

09:27.500 --> 09:31.060
There's an altercation where you beat the shit out of somebody with a trombone case

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Good times good times

09:36.940 --> 09:39.220
Griffin's big claim to fame is just just Griffin

09:40.740 --> 09:44.800
Like if they look like I'm gonna slap somebody you got a guy get away from them

09:44.800 --> 09:47.460
Are you who was that gentleman with the giant hands? Yeah?

09:49.100 --> 09:51.100
What's with ever long over there

09:57.340 --> 10:02.100
Spring asks I need relationship advice on how to be more romantic my wife states that I am NOT

10:02.380 --> 10:06.420
Romantic and I need ideas for how to do so McElroy's I need your help

10:08.180 --> 10:10.700
You've come to the right place have you

10:10.700 --> 10:12.700
I

10:13.460 --> 10:15.940
Hmm take her to a nice monster truck rally

10:17.180 --> 10:20.360
Spontaneity is the secret. Mm-hmm. That's my advice

10:21.460 --> 10:24.400
Stab a drink. Are you are you talking like sexy?

10:25.540 --> 10:31.880
Sexy romantic or like romantic romantic like I made dinner for you romantic making dinner is a classic

10:31.880 --> 10:40.460
Mm-hmm clean the house. Yeah, that's what I was gonna say do the dishes. I think that romance is not doing what somebody

10:40.460 --> 10:45.440
asks you to do but doing what they want you to do because that that I think it's sort of at the heart of

10:45.440 --> 10:47.440
romance because that that you

10:47.580 --> 10:51.420
It makes the woman or man feel like you know them really well

10:51.420 --> 10:57.740
and that's the feeling that they want like you know them and still care enough to put the extra effort in so do something that

10:57.740 --> 10:59.660
you think she wants you to do but

10:59.660 --> 11:04.020
Wouldn't ask you to do if that's the but that's the but you know, it's it's it's completely up to you

11:04.060 --> 11:09.100
Get why don't you see if you can get James Taylor to write a song about her. There you go

11:10.440 --> 11:14.780
We know James Taylor little harem girl dance do a harem girl dances another

11:15.780 --> 11:21.020
No, don't do that unless I'm trying to fight with you. Yeah, that's like whoa, what's up with this dancing guy?

11:21.660 --> 11:24.100
Okay, you can make her hash browns. He doesn't like this

11:24.820 --> 11:28.080
She may not it might not be romantic, but she'll be she'll be full

11:28.080 --> 11:33.200
You know and just every so often fire some flowers. Don't make it a big deal

11:33.200 --> 11:37.760
Don't be like look what I did just yeah from work hand with the flowers. Say I love you

11:38.560 --> 11:43.200
Before you settle down to play video games for several hours. Yeah, just let her know that you care

11:43.320 --> 11:46.240
It's it's mainly about putting effort in that's what I would say

11:46.400 --> 11:49.240
So if you put the effort in it doesn't really matter what you do

11:49.240 --> 11:53.600
I mean try to do the right thing, but it doesn't really matter and you might get some a

11:54.600 --> 11:56.600
for effort

11:56.600 --> 11:57.480
Oh

11:57.480 --> 11:58.760
Yeah

11:58.760 --> 12:04.040
Yahoo answers user Lala asks. How do you get airbrushed poreless skin naturally?

12:05.160 --> 12:07.160
Is it possible?

12:09.320 --> 12:12.400
Pretty sure your skin is is what mannequins out

12:13.520 --> 12:19.880
Pores Lala. Yeah, you definitely definitely need the pores. I think I disagree what you mean to do is be beautiful

12:20.920 --> 12:22.400
sure, but

12:22.400 --> 12:28.880
Like your your skin is a porous membrane through which things need to move or else you'll know that is so

12:29.080 --> 12:35.880
2000 and late in this day and age what you need to do is get some surgery to have every pore individually removed

12:35.880 --> 12:38.760
Mm-hmm. Have you seen Chad? He's got that non porous

12:39.240 --> 12:42.760
They took a skin graft off the back of his thighs and just yeah

12:43.440 --> 12:49.320
Just filled in his holes. He sweats from his mouth though. That's from his mouth like a dog, which is

12:49.320 --> 12:53.480
A chatter you drooling. No, don't be gauche. I don't have pores

12:55.680 --> 12:59.640
I'm part of me sir. Perhaps you didn't notice my smooth a mannequin like skin

13:00.400 --> 13:06.440
Excuse me. I see a water cup here. I don't see a sweat cup for the sweat pouring out of my mouth

13:06.720 --> 13:11.960
It's quite warm in your establishment and I need a receptacle for my mouth mouth sweat

13:11.960 --> 13:18.120
Where is your trough? Where do you keep your troughs? Because I'm about to hit the tread. Pardon me. Where's the spittoon?

13:19.680 --> 13:21.960
Where's your novelty Western spittoon?

13:22.760 --> 13:23.400
Excuse me

13:23.400 --> 13:29.400
The the the tone when I spit into your spittoon with my mouth sweat was that a and I prefer a nice B flat

13:29.400 --> 13:31.400
Could you have your spittoon shooter?

13:31.400 --> 13:39.020
Beautiful damn it. Have you guys heard about how fast Chad can swim? I guess

13:41.240 --> 13:45.480
Gets in the water and just that's what that's what was going with Michael Phelps

13:45.480 --> 13:47.880
He's trying to get high enough to convince himself to go for

13:51.480 --> 13:56.540
Lala oh, well, I you go ahead and get those pores filled in because it sounds like something that would kill you

13:56.960 --> 14:00.480
Yeah, or coat your face in Play-Doh. No people ask

14:00.480 --> 14:04.840
It ask if they can see your pores and then if they can't then that is yours

14:05.360 --> 14:11.720
My question is this is from Jared via Google Voice. I always forget to zip my fly and halfway through my day

14:11.720 --> 14:18.540
I realized this I was basically wondering what's the easiest way to zip it without anyone noticing. Oh, that's that's a good one

14:20.760 --> 14:24.760
Usually I like to pretend to read something on a wall. There's always things on walls

14:24.760 --> 14:30.640
Yeah, just go read. I sound like Andy Rooney for a second. People are always putting things. Yeah, I

14:31.360 --> 14:38.560
Notice that you notice that why can't our walls just be wall like go pretend to read stuff on a wall. That's pretty smooth

14:39.200 --> 14:41.200
Or stand I pretend to masturbate

14:43.920 --> 14:45.920
Stand in the corner and pretend to masturbate

14:46.080 --> 14:49.080
But face the corner don't face outwards

14:49.640 --> 14:53.600
And every so often turn your head and look over your shoulder and make eye contact with someone

14:53.600 --> 14:55.600
This one's for you, Dave

14:56.160 --> 14:59.800
Zip it up and announce loudly. Sorry ladies shows over

15:02.800 --> 15:04.800
Work out pretty good

15:05.280 --> 15:07.280
Check it. Check it

15:08.240 --> 15:10.240
Curtains going up

15:16.240 --> 15:18.720
In the back seat of my dog's an act to check it out

15:18.720 --> 15:24.520
Seven eleven o'clock shows totally different from seven ladies, you know what I mean? I think you do

15:25.800 --> 15:28.960
What it what do I do about a clingy friend?

15:29.560 --> 15:32.080
Who likes my company way more than I do hers?

15:32.280 --> 15:39.680
She's proclaimed us besties without any encouragement from me and she comments on every tweet despite not getting most of them. I

15:40.480 --> 15:43.400
Don't get why this is funny. Silly me lols

15:44.600 --> 15:46.120
terrible

15:46.120 --> 15:51.900
My question is why first of all, no one needs to comment on tweets like I get it

15:52.080 --> 15:57.480
Don't don't do that. I would appreciate if you would do that more. I tweet you specifically sometimes

15:57.720 --> 16:03.280
I'm not gonna tell you your tweets are funny. That's just last week. I tweeted you about that

16:03.880 --> 16:05.880
that Ferris Bueller

16:06.080 --> 16:08.560
Being similar to Fight Club and you didn't even respond

16:08.560 --> 16:08.920
No

16:08.920 --> 16:13.320
I'm a terrible brother because I read that and it's the funniest thing I've ever read and it honestly made me think

16:13.320 --> 16:16.680
I mean grow made you grow made you learn a person

16:17.280 --> 16:21.120
Like oh, okay. We're not helping them. We're helping each other. This is

16:22.760 --> 16:24.520
Gosh

16:24.520 --> 16:27.440
The hard thing about this is that you're not gonna suddenly

16:28.440 --> 16:30.440
Start liking this person more

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
She probably

16:36.120 --> 16:38.120
Wants to be more than besties

16:38.120 --> 16:43.440
Well, you think it's the the apocalypse rare in its head. Oh, is it a lady?

16:43.440 --> 16:45.880
Is it a lady asking this question? I

16:46.560 --> 16:49.040
Think so. Well see you don't know. Oh

16:49.800 --> 16:57.560
Wow, I I think that the the the tough spot about this is that I think relationships like this are much easy

16:57.560 --> 17:00.360
This sounds like somebody who's who's maybe in in high school or college

17:00.640 --> 17:06.800
These relationships are much easier to navigate when you're an adult because you just don't see them. You just don't see them

17:06.800 --> 17:10.080
It's irrelevant. It doesn't matter if they're your besties or not

17:10.440 --> 17:14.440
I think it for the moment though. All you can do is just sort of

17:16.040 --> 17:18.600
You know, there's no easy way to back off of it

17:18.600 --> 17:23.680
You kind of have to cut the cord and the problem is unfortunately it sounds like you're actually kind of like this person

17:23.680 --> 17:30.160
You know, right you describe her as a friend and you know, so that's not like this person. I hate things

17:30.160 --> 17:34.460
We're friends. So that makes it tricky because if you hate them, you can just straight up be like, hey, I hate you

17:34.460 --> 17:35.900
the

17:35.900 --> 17:41.780
best thing you can hope for is that it's like buying a pair of uncomfortable shoes and eventually it'll get broken in and

17:41.980 --> 17:44.460
Be a little bit more comfortable, but you're never gonna love them

17:44.460 --> 17:47.940
Yeah, and by that point the shoes are gonna be old and so you just throw them away

17:48.460 --> 17:53.100
Yeah old shoes and you know, honestly, you should really think to yourself

17:53.100 --> 17:57.820
How much is this impacting your life? Like if they're coming on your Twitter, whatever like

17:58.660 --> 18:01.340
Sometimes it's worth it to have somebody who's in your corner that hard

18:01.340 --> 18:07.100
Even if sometimes they they get on your nerves and chances are she doesn't have a lot of friends. So yeah

18:07.900 --> 18:13.040
Play it cool play cool, but set boundaries and let her know that you can't spend every waking moment with her

18:13.220 --> 18:16.860
There's no reason to be a jerk about it. Dear MBMB a in

18:17.860 --> 18:19.540
Okay

18:19.540 --> 18:21.540
Did we have my brother and

18:22.660 --> 18:24.660
Nonny our grandma nonny

18:26.580 --> 18:28.460
Dear my brother my brother and nonny

18:28.460 --> 18:32.140
What's the best way to tell my girlfriend that she should shave her armpits more often?

18:32.140 --> 18:35.300
I'm afraid to hurt her feelings, but her stubbles kind of gross me out

18:36.940 --> 18:38.940
Her stubbles

18:39.380 --> 18:41.380
I've named each one

18:41.660 --> 18:43.660
This is Gregor the stubble

18:45.260 --> 18:47.260
Why are you so into her stubble I

18:48.540 --> 18:54.940
Can I tell you something? I've been married for I don't know some years don't don't here's not a good way

18:54.940 --> 19:00.140
There's no best way. There's only the worst way, which is to do it at all. I

19:02.300 --> 19:04.460
Just came up with the best way oh god

19:04.460 --> 19:07.860
I know what you're gonna say shave go ahead and shave your own armpits

19:08.180 --> 19:15.060
Super clean and then just keep saying things like feel how smooth that is. Isn't that nice? Isn't that a nice feeling on your hands?

19:16.060 --> 19:20.140
I love that you considered shaving her armpits while she's sleeping

19:20.140 --> 19:28.140
I was thinking about that or or along those same lines maybe when you're taking a shower together say it would be such a turn-on

19:28.140 --> 19:30.140
If you would let me

19:30.220 --> 19:36.460
Shave your underarms and then do it every morning. Oh, yeah, that's good and bring up the same things like I read about this on

19:36.460 --> 19:41.340
The internet. Mm-hmm. I heard about this in Cosmo. I'm the the scrape of

19:41.860 --> 19:44.460
the razor against your poreless armpits

19:44.460 --> 19:52.300
I here's the the only way you can navigate this well form spring is is

19:52.860 --> 19:54.860
To not make it seem as though

19:56.260 --> 20:00.780
It the it's all about your phrasing it can't be that her stubble grosses you out

20:01.020 --> 20:04.660
It has to be that smooth underarms turn you on

20:05.260 --> 20:12.020
Yeah, you know like a decision she makes for you. Yes. Next time she shaves underneath her arms say

20:12.020 --> 20:17.180
Oh my god, it's so hot. So sexy to me when your underarms are shaved now

20:17.180 --> 20:22.220
Be careful because if you push it too hard, she's gonna start thinking you're some kind of armpit weirdo

20:23.380 --> 20:27.300
Say okay. You got to say first then honey. I'm not an armpit weirdo

20:27.620 --> 20:33.860
I'm not one of those pitties you read about on the internet. Yeah, don't if she does shave her armpits don't

20:34.700 --> 20:39.660
Don't just go up there and say let me see him and then say and then say

20:39.660 --> 20:41.660
closer

20:41.740 --> 20:46.460
Shave closer next time against what you're gonna saying. Definitely. Definitely. Don't do that

20:47.460 --> 20:52.940
Pits and say I want to be in there. Yeah. Hey looking good. I'd like to be in there

20:54.100 --> 20:57.020
I'd like to be in your under your arms. I

20:57.860 --> 21:03.860
Like to be underneath there. Can I live in there? I'd like to be in there. Just let me hang out in

21:04.620 --> 21:07.340
There and then wear her armpit like a hat

21:07.340 --> 21:09.340
all

21:09.620 --> 21:10.580
Day

21:10.580 --> 21:14.500
Okay, I'm ready to go to sleep now. Can you stop wearing my underarm as a hat?

21:14.780 --> 21:19.740
Should I get my this is from Anna Anna says should I get my knuckles tattooed?

21:19.740 --> 21:21.140
I really want to do it

21:21.140 --> 21:24.540
But my mom hates the idea and thinks people will view me poorly for the rest of my life

21:24.540 --> 21:29.580
I do well, I told my husband I was thinking about not doing it and he started making chicken noises

21:29.580 --> 21:35.300
Sheep sheep sheep sheep sheep sheep my tattoo artist friend drew it on for me in Sharpie

21:35.300 --> 21:38.420
So I could see how it would look and live with it for a day. I loved it

21:38.420 --> 21:44.740
I don't want to hurt my mom's feelings, but you only live once right Anna. Well, that's Anna this she attached a picture

21:45.340 --> 21:50.440
Did you have a bit drawn on to her knuckles and it said Earl Grey? Oh

21:50.440 --> 21:58.720
Which is the best thing I've ever seen that's kind of fresh it is pretty funny and she is a burlesque knife thrower

21:59.960 --> 22:06.640
Yeah, Anna, that's fresh. I'm sorry. Here. Here's here's the best rationale that I've ever heard about tattoos

22:06.640 --> 22:11.640
It really it puts it on perspective. I saw it's actually when I went to get my first tattoo

22:11.640 --> 22:13.640
I saw an article that somebody had written

22:13.640 --> 22:19.600
on that particular tattoo parlor in the local paper and the the tattoo artist said

22:19.600 --> 22:26.640
People always tell me would you want that on your hand when you're an old man?

22:26.640 --> 22:32.600
And I always say if I'm an old man and my biggest concern is whether or not I have a tattoo

22:32.640 --> 22:34.640
I've lived a pretty good life

22:39.640 --> 22:46.280
I mean and if you're a burlesque dancer, I think burlesque knife thrower burlesque knife thrower

22:46.280 --> 22:52.400
I imagine there's some dancing involved in that though. Probably um, yeah, just go for it. Just go for it

22:52.400 --> 22:58.880
Who cares it's it makes you a more interesting person and I really think that in this it doesn't make you I'm sorry

22:58.880 --> 23:01.600
Let me rephrase that it's it's something you want to do

23:01.600 --> 23:06.840
And and if it's that important to you that you're willing to do it, you're not gonna like suddenly hate it

23:06.840 --> 23:08.600
It's part of your character, you know

23:08.600 --> 23:14.200
It's something that if somebody like pointed out and said hey that's cool and like you had a story behind it

23:14.200 --> 23:18.360
Something is really important to you always do stuff that is important to you

23:18.520 --> 23:23.560
Yeah, and unless your husband is awesome for doing chicken noises because you didn't want to get a tattoo on your hands

23:23.560 --> 23:25.600
I would I would also say Anna that

23:26.280 --> 23:28.360
before you do it, you need to come up with a

23:29.480 --> 23:33.000
An excuse a reasoning for it that you give to commoners

23:33.000 --> 23:37.320
I think that you need to have two excuses for every tattoo one that you give to cool people that

23:37.560 --> 23:39.320
why the tattoo is cool and

23:39.320 --> 23:45.680
when the you have to lame people like on I we all have these Zelda tattoos and cool people I tell it's a Zelda tattoo and

23:46.000 --> 23:50.680
And people I don't give a shit about I tell them it's it's it's tribal. I say it's a joke

23:51.360 --> 23:53.560
You say it's Egyptian. I say it's Masonic

23:54.080 --> 23:56.080
That's so weird

23:56.840 --> 24:00.800
My pineapple tattoo. I just when people ask me about it, and I don't want to tell them

24:00.800 --> 24:03.420
I just say I'm really into pineapples right now. Yeah

24:03.420 --> 24:11.000
Yeah, I'm here in their own stories people vastly arrested me how much time everybody else spends thinking about them

24:11.040 --> 24:17.760
If you want it you get it you only go around once so I have a short series of three yahoo

24:18.280 --> 24:20.280
Questions that are related

24:20.560 --> 24:25.160
So I figured we could knock them all out really quick and in like a short segment

24:26.080 --> 24:29.120
It just about you know it's about the universe

24:29.120 --> 24:34.760
You know it's about the universe. It's about space. It's about man's journey into space

24:34.760 --> 24:39.400
And I was thinking it would be nice for us to just take a moment and just get all Carl Sagan on this shit

24:39.680 --> 24:42.120
All right, do it take me on a journey Griffin, okay?

24:42.600 --> 24:49.160
Question one what are the stars in outer space what they're made of what they look like this one's reasonable

24:49.160 --> 24:52.640
It's from Jeffrey pet, so I'm figuring he's a younger person

24:54.280 --> 24:58.040
Jeffrey if you really want to know the answer to this I would suggest listening to they might be Giants

24:58.040 --> 24:59.840
classic

24:59.840 --> 25:01.760
Why does the sunshine I?

25:01.760 --> 25:05.160
Feel like it fills in a lot of the blanks that that you don't seem to understand

25:05.160 --> 25:07.880
But but don't but it's most of it is untrue

25:07.880 --> 25:08.280
Yes

25:08.280 --> 25:15.200
But so listen to the new one off of their CD here comes science and as a counterpoint

25:15.320 --> 25:18.240
The stars are made up of the souls of our ancestors

25:18.240 --> 25:26.080
Yeah, and also the devil the sun shines because the devil lives in it. That's correct. Yeah, okay, so that's question one

25:26.080 --> 25:31.840
Question two is the universe really inflating or are we shrinking I?

25:32.480 --> 25:36.640
Don't understand the inflating expanding universe concept if you're inside of something in this case

25:36.640 --> 25:38.920
I think all of the scientists are inside of the universe

25:38.920 --> 25:41.920
Can you really tell that this thing the universe is expanding?

25:41.920 --> 25:47.000
I don't think so maybe the universe is not getting larger, but we humans planets etc are getting smaller

25:47.000 --> 25:51.880
I think that the only thing we can surely say is the universe is getting larger with respect to us

25:51.880 --> 25:58.440
Ps1 sorry for the bad English ps2. I'm not very advanced in physics, so I can be wrong in some manners

25:58.440 --> 26:00.720
Please warn me if I'm doing a big mistake I

26:03.200 --> 26:08.360
Like that I'm gonna read you know what what if Galileo had had chopped that one like listen

26:08.360 --> 26:13.040
This is just me. I'm just spitballing here. This is just me you guys see you

26:13.040 --> 26:17.440
I have no idea what I'm talking about so you guys listen old Galileo

26:17.440 --> 26:24.480
You guys food my whole son thing, but check this shit out. We're shrinking. What do you think just putting it out there?

26:24.720 --> 26:31.400
Don't really know not certain. I'll be honest. I've been having this this feeling in my core lately

26:31.400 --> 26:35.120
And I can't describe it. It's just kind of like a weird sensation

26:35.120 --> 26:38.240
And I think it might be because we're all shrinking you in unison

26:38.440 --> 26:40.760
But I know where I can because we're all shrinking

26:40.880 --> 26:46.280
You remember that scene in men in black right at the end when it turns out the whole kit and caboodles just in a big

26:46.280 --> 26:48.160
intergalactic marble game

26:48.160 --> 26:50.160
Uh-huh think about it. Oh

26:52.360 --> 26:57.360
Question yeah, I'm supposed to you laugh at yahoo questions not get freaked out. Oh, you're gonna hate. I got a gun

26:58.040 --> 27:00.520
Okay, question three the final question of the series

27:01.280 --> 27:04.960
What was traditionally done to prevent mind control by space elves?

27:04.960 --> 27:09.960
I

27:11.800 --> 27:14.680
Yeah, he's not saying how do you do it today?

27:15.200 --> 27:17.040
He's saying like how are you gonna?

27:17.040 --> 27:22.880
Do it where people laugh at you old and you're like wild west remedies for mind control by space elves

27:22.880 --> 27:24.880
There had to be some sort of tincture

27:25.200 --> 27:31.600
That settlers of Genghis Khan used to use this exact same thing they used to rub an ungent on their babies

27:31.600 --> 27:35.200
So the space elves couldn't take over their poor baby minds there

27:35.200 --> 27:42.040
He used to make a Khan used to make a poultice out of lotus flowers and honey and he would rub that on his mustache

27:42.720 --> 27:48.080
Everyone knows that space elves can't get through opium. Yeah, it's true because they get too high

27:48.080 --> 27:52.200
Yeah, and they freak out cover your babies and sweet sweet opium he yeah

27:52.200 --> 28:01.960
I just refreshed it and there's some additional details that say come on. I'm not joking. They're from Venus. They are gross I

28:01.960 --> 28:05.080
I feel like people are trying to bait you now. They're trying to get you specifically to look at their questions

28:05.080 --> 28:12.240
That's entirely possible if that's the most roundabout thing in the world though like I'm going to post a question on this website

28:12.240 --> 28:16.480
So hopefully Griffin McElroy looks at it. I mean if that was this guy's goal

28:16.480 --> 28:23.820
He succeeded my problem is it's his problem with these these space elves is it that they're they're trying to control his mind

28:23.820 --> 28:26.000
Or that they're gross and he'd rather not be around them I

28:28.080 --> 28:33.560
Do not agree with them politically yeah, I don't like that there. I don't like their stance on immigration

28:35.200 --> 28:38.940
So here's here's a here's a good one. I recently got a sweet new ride

28:39.160 --> 28:44.480
I've heard that cars are like chick magnets the problem is but I'm having a conversation with a girl

28:44.480 --> 28:47.480
It's really in my car conversations happen in buildings

28:47.480 --> 28:53.400
How do I leverage my new car into getting girls this involve using terms like chick magnet and sweet ride and ironically?

28:53.440 --> 28:57.220
Evan Gmail well simple answer drive your car into the building

28:59.400 --> 29:04.380
Billy Joel gets more tang than anybody on the planet yeah

29:05.440 --> 29:11.480
Sorry about your fracture, but check these out look at these rims that are on top of your leg

29:11.480 --> 29:18.200
I see them. Yeah, yeah, it's got a hemi crushing my ocular cavity. I've got a pretty good look at it

29:20.760 --> 29:23.980
So so kill girls with it, that's one two

29:26.080 --> 29:32.880
Get white spray paint and write the word taxi on your car and then wait outside of crowded buildings that should work

29:33.240 --> 29:36.080
Write it crudely though in like a little rascals font

29:36.080 --> 29:40.680
With a backward a make them backward backward a

29:41.360 --> 29:43.360
Yeah, and taxi

29:43.360 --> 29:48.520
Okay, I was thinking lowercase. Okay, that makes more. Okay. Thank you. I'm backward X

29:49.320 --> 29:52.720
But I I think what you need to do is start practicing this line

29:52.720 --> 29:56.760
Can I buy you a drink and would you like to share it with me inside my car mm-hmm?

29:57.240 --> 30:02.040
Give a bartender this lady, and I really hate you know can we get to go up?

30:03.280 --> 30:05.280
Can I get a travel off?

30:05.280 --> 30:11.120
Do you have sippy cups because I don't want to spill in my new car because it is very nice

30:11.280 --> 30:14.480
Could I get a lid for this mgd-64, please?

30:15.360 --> 30:19.480
How about a nipple have a nipple that I could use I like how he doesn't

30:20.560 --> 30:23.200
He says that cars like this are chick magnets

30:23.200 --> 30:27.860
But he doesn't say exactly what kind of car he owns because I think we would better be able to advise him

30:27.860 --> 30:34.780
Oh, I've got myself a 2005 PT Cruiser. Let's do it

30:35.300 --> 30:38.780
The other option is and I think this is a little more outside the box

30:38.780 --> 30:45.460
But have you considered acting like a car to try to steer conversations that way if you ever walk up to a girl say hey

30:45.700 --> 30:49.780
Vroom-vroom open my door, and they say what if you say I've got a car

30:50.820 --> 30:56.980
If they're impressed by that then I think you're halfway home. Have you thought about maybe an airbrushed t-shirt? Oh?

30:56.980 --> 31:01.940
An airbrushed t-shirt. I have a car my car. I have a car. It's pretty sweet ma

31:02.660 --> 31:07.380
Apostrophe car, and it's a picture and then just an ironed-on picture of your car

31:07.860 --> 31:10.340
It's a picture of you sitting on the hood of your car

31:10.860 --> 31:16.060
Making out with a girl only the girl doesn't have a face. It just says your face here on it

31:16.500 --> 31:21.020
Yeah, and make sure it's not a mannequin because girls have a pretty good sense of that. Yeah, they can see the pores

31:21.020 --> 31:27.540
And so I think all those are really good suggestions. I think we've pretty much hit the nail on the head

31:28.980 --> 31:34.900
Hello brothers, I just had a quick question for you guys. I'm sorry if this makes me seem insecure

31:35.580 --> 31:39.100
But is it bad if I don't want to date a girl because she has too many male friends

31:39.980 --> 31:41.980
Thanks Kirk

31:42.020 --> 31:44.420
Thanks, Kurt Kirk. I love that Kirk

31:44.420 --> 31:50.420
Kirk Kirk, I'm not trying to you know hate on Kirk, but he did spelt to

31:51.140 --> 31:58.100
Tw-oh which makes me think she has two male friends, and that's too many for Kirk's liking

31:59.460 --> 32:02.700
Shit, maybe he just forgot the to oh so she has to two minutes

32:03.900 --> 32:09.340
Lose two male friends you would be right in the zone. I think we need to balance out

32:09.340 --> 32:11.700
I've got eight and you've got ten so

32:11.700 --> 32:15.780
Yeah, get rid of those two. I don't like John, and I don't like Steven

32:16.780 --> 32:18.900
You could be having one way to get the Kirk

32:19.220 --> 32:22.700
Kirk he would if you just if you just drop two of those zeros

32:23.040 --> 32:26.020
You can get with the champ Kirk or give me one of them

32:26.020 --> 32:30.100
And then we'll both have nine and then we'll go straight to Kirkland wait a minute wait a minute

32:30.420 --> 32:37.940
Kirk if you make those guys your friends, then you just have a large circle of friends. That's crap problem solved

32:38.660 --> 32:40.660
or

32:40.660 --> 32:43.180
Every time you see one of them just ask

32:44.140 --> 32:45.740
Hey you two bangin

32:45.740 --> 32:47.660
Like make sure it's in front of her though

32:47.660 --> 32:54.980
So she she knows that you know what's up and also it'll make her feel special and loved and wanted yeah fight for her

32:54.980 --> 32:58.080
Yeah, just every time you see any one of her friends punch them

32:58.700 --> 33:02.460
because I Justin was joking but but it's a it's a

33:02.980 --> 33:09.380
Scientific fact that her and all of her male friends have either had sex at some point or came awfully close

33:09.380 --> 33:15.540
Yeah, that's just fine. That's just scientific fact. There was homecoming both their dates stood him up

33:15.540 --> 33:17.540
They came really really close

33:18.140 --> 33:22.100
They've at least got the third base, and they were rounding home when his dad walked in

33:24.260 --> 33:29.180
In BNB am this is a this is a different sort of question for us in BNB am when a girl

33:29.180 --> 33:32.140
You've just met is fully expecting you to get her number

33:32.140 --> 33:36.500
But you don't like her like that is it better to avoid the issue which makes things super awkward

33:36.500 --> 33:43.660
Or to get those digits without any intention of calling oh, this is why I carry around this one a big pouch of smoke bombs with me

33:43.660 --> 33:49.180
Everywhere I go because you drop one of those and then you dive through the nearest window and then the situation is averted

33:49.700 --> 33:51.020
or

33:51.020 --> 33:53.940
Tell her you're gonna call then pack your bags and move right away

33:54.940 --> 34:00.000
Move to some you know rural neighborhood in Utah where there's no service

34:01.180 --> 34:03.520
you could you could do that classic like

34:03.520 --> 34:09.960
Listen, I'm I'm worried that this this is going really good, but I'm worried. It's not meant to be I'm gonna

34:10.760 --> 34:13.600
put my phone number in a copy of

34:14.760 --> 34:20.920
Love the time of cholera like in serendipity, and I'm gonna sell it to a used bookstore, but actually just burn it

34:21.080 --> 34:23.080
And they just burn it

34:24.120 --> 34:25.480
So it's like romantic

34:25.480 --> 34:30.200
But in the same way you're never gonna have to see her again or just start talking shit about phones

34:30.200 --> 34:35.080
Just like like halfway through your convo if you think it's going that way. It's like ah all those buttons

34:37.880 --> 34:39.320
There are no buttons

34:39.320 --> 34:45.040
Like it's their just they're even worse if she takes out a phone make like a yuck face like oh

34:45.200 --> 34:50.520
I'll just slap it out of his phones in this day and age. It's all about mental powers. Yeah, you could break her phone

34:50.520 --> 34:54.200
Yeah, yeah sure let me just put it right in oh no

34:54.200 --> 35:00.920
These big I put strong hands of mine I studied under David Blaine for a few years

35:00.920 --> 35:03.680
So give me your phone, and I'm gonna dunk it in this glass of water

35:04.480 --> 35:07.000
And then when she looks at you to say ta-da here. We go

35:07.560 --> 35:09.440
mind freak

35:09.440 --> 35:11.960
Break I just convinced you to give me your phone

35:12.800 --> 35:15.160
My freaks. I'm a girl

35:15.160 --> 35:21.200
I'm not I'm a girl who plays Xbox games like Halo and Modern Warfare 2 and mind freak

35:21.200 --> 35:25.000
I need a lot of great people this way, but there are always a few who think because of a girl

35:25.000 --> 35:27.160
I should be making them a sandwich instead of playing

35:27.320 --> 35:29.320
What is the best way to deal with these guys?

35:29.560 --> 35:34.520
Also Tristan the Marine got me hooked on you guys to thank him for introducing me to such an awesome show

35:34.520 --> 35:41.840
Tristan the Marine not only protecting our nation protecting us swooping Osama's Poon. He is

35:41.840 --> 35:49.640
Expanding our eyes. He's evangelizing. He's protecting us from the far worse threat of people not listening to our show

35:50.920 --> 35:57.940
Think that's way worse than Osama. Thank you just thank you Tristan for your service and your sacrifice so so Rachel

36:00.000 --> 36:03.840
Did the only surefire way is to talk like those

36:03.840 --> 36:11.320
And people think you're a monster like a scary monster, and they won't and they won't they won't ask you for anything

36:12.320 --> 36:14.320
talk like this

36:14.440 --> 36:20.440
Yell things like I will come through the TV and kill you yeah, or get a deep-voiced man to do it

36:20.480 --> 36:22.480
We used to play a game

36:22.840 --> 36:26.920
Where I I would or Sydney, I think would be on the on the microphone

36:27.920 --> 36:30.740
Just talking to people while we played Modern Warfare or Halo

36:30.740 --> 36:37.380
And then we would grab the mic away either Justin or Ryan and yell at them that we were going to come murder them

36:38.260 --> 36:40.260
Yeah, that was those funds

36:40.620 --> 36:42.620
Have you considered?

36:42.660 --> 36:45.300
How would you even get the sandwich to them? Yeah?

36:45.300 --> 36:45.940
Yeah

36:45.940 --> 36:53.060
start asking them really detailed question about the sandwich about the sandwich like ask them like for a FedEx account number and and

36:53.300 --> 36:54.820
like

36:54.820 --> 36:56.820
any food allergies

36:56.820 --> 37:04.380
And I think you need to know preferred deli meat get their address and put it right on the internet and then just

37:04.780 --> 37:06.780
watch 4chan go

37:08.980 --> 37:10.740
I

37:10.740 --> 37:12.740
Think you've got to really beat them

37:12.940 --> 37:17.420
Like you've really got to be better than they are at Halo and in Modern Warfare 2

37:17.460 --> 37:22.220
that's that's I think a surefire way because then you can be like that's right, I'm a girl and

37:22.220 --> 37:27.620
And I just beat you and this is me humping your face. This is me humping your face

37:27.900 --> 37:30.580
They're gonna. How does they how it's they are going to like that

37:31.300 --> 37:32.900
Yeah

37:32.900 --> 37:40.300
Or you can trick them into sexually harassing you and then report them. Yeah, that works good. I like that Yahoo answers user

37:41.060 --> 37:43.580
Smiley face, it's just a smiley face to modicon

37:44.580 --> 37:46.540
Okay asks

37:46.540 --> 37:49.660
Do guys like Peter Griffin get laid in real life?

37:49.660 --> 37:51.580
in

37:51.580 --> 37:55.220
terms of characteristics i.e. fat retards I

38:00.100 --> 38:01.620
Could draw you a bit

38:01.620 --> 38:08.100
I could I could paint a picture of the first asking this question, and I would be like like like like

38:08.700 --> 38:15.140
Sketch artist level accurate like you can put up a wanted poster up of this bitch, and you can be like of that guy

38:15.140 --> 38:19.780
Oh, that's that guy who I think y'all answer this question Justin knows exactly what he looks like um

38:21.100 --> 38:23.100
No

38:23.260 --> 38:30.160
No, they well they have to pay for it. Yes, okay, then that that instance. They don't get married to you know

38:31.340 --> 38:38.540
If you it means after if you mean like they're fat and like if you mean okay fat fat if they're retarded if you're using

38:38.540 --> 38:45.380
Them as a pejorative if you're saying like oh, you're so retarded then no if they're clinically retarded

38:45.380 --> 38:51.460
Then yes those services are provided by the government your tax dollars or are you talking? I'm sorry can we stop the show really quick?

38:51.460 --> 38:53.460
Are you describing?

38:53.780 --> 38:55.780
hookers that the government pays for

38:56.620 --> 38:58.460
to sleep with

38:58.460 --> 39:00.460
Retarded retarded people you're talking about

39:00.980 --> 39:06.700
You're talking about on the inside track in DC. Is this a new thing is this been going on for a while

39:06.700 --> 39:09.060
You're talking about hookers that are partitioned

39:09.980 --> 39:14.900
For retarded people to sleep with on the government dime my tax dollars

39:16.300 --> 39:20.860
Right you get a helmet they provide you with a helmet for the right for who?

39:23.020 --> 39:26.620
Exactly for the hooker okay, there's usually um there's usually

39:27.460 --> 39:32.060
Model planes the light dangling from their ceiling sir so the the helmet and also the strength

39:32.780 --> 39:34.300
Yeah, this

39:34.300 --> 39:38.900
It's hard for this is the worst thing we've ever said on the show

39:40.180 --> 39:47.500
It's it's hard for for a mentally handicapped person to get you know aroused without giving someone a bonk on the head

39:55.020 --> 40:02.220
They give them a they give them all windmill windmill chop right to the crown a lot of people don't know this but that's actually how

40:02.220 --> 40:10.180
New retarded people are created they it's a hooker having sex with retarded person who gives them a bonk on the head until they themselves

40:10.180 --> 40:12.500
Are retarded and then they have to

40:13.380 --> 40:16.100
Then they are then the government has to get a norm

40:16.780 --> 40:21.300
Male to have sex with that hooker and the cycle continues can we move on?

40:21.860 --> 40:25.340
Yeah, please you're gone. You're definitely gonna edit this out right no

40:26.620 --> 40:28.760
You have to promise me you'll edit this out

40:28.760 --> 40:34.180
Kenneth I like it Kenneth on gmail asks my question

40:34.720 --> 40:38.320
However is how old is too old to think you might have developed superpowers

40:38.320 --> 40:43.040
I ripped a metal door off its hinges at work and thought okay this might be a super strength

40:43.040 --> 40:49.960
I tried to lift something ridiculously heavy and no jive just a broken door. I guess do you guys do this and when it's too old

40:50.760 --> 40:54.760
Straight up Kenneth you do have a superpower, but it only works on doors

40:55.560 --> 40:56.880
some doors

40:56.880 --> 40:58.880
Some doors not all doors

40:58.960 --> 41:05.420
Some doors broken doors. You're you already have super good taste in podcasts. Is that is that uh is that a superpower?

41:06.920 --> 41:11.480
No, I actually didn't Justin if you were to have a superpower based off of your everyday life

41:11.480 --> 41:13.080
What do you think it would be?

41:13.080 --> 41:18.040
Like if you were to all sudden realize oh my god. This is a superpower. I would I would want to

41:18.040 --> 41:25.800
Have a super ability to be able to tell people if they were too old to have developed superpowers. I

41:26.880 --> 41:29.360
Think that that I don't think that that's shooting too high

41:29.360 --> 41:34.160
And I think that it would be really useful in the day-to-day because I could really ruin people's days

41:34.240 --> 41:36.960
There's what has to be like net too old yet

41:36.960 --> 41:40.960
Sorry, mine is I can tell what people's shoe sizes are by the sound of their voice

41:41.560 --> 41:44.440
Like really Jared who called in Google voice

41:45.040 --> 41:47.040
He was a ten and a half

41:47.040 --> 41:51.760
Wow, that's incredible. Yeah, that's amazing. How do you do that? I don't know size 13

41:53.680 --> 41:59.840
My god, I can do the same thing but only when that voice is telling me what size shoes they purchased

42:00.800 --> 42:06.200
Then I'm pretty good. I'm not just the shoes for themselves. I'm like 5050 because the listening thing. Mm-hmm

42:06.920 --> 42:12.360
The look of the comprehension just isn't yeah, I want to hear Griffin's last question because it's always a humdinger

42:12.840 --> 42:14.840
but first I want to tell you about

42:14.840 --> 42:16.360
all

42:16.360 --> 42:18.360
kinds of exciting things

42:18.400 --> 42:19.720
first off

42:19.720 --> 42:24.280
We have one more week of pre-orders for my brother my brother and me t-shirts

42:24.800 --> 42:29.400
You can find those at if you go to nbmb am comm and you click buy stuff

42:30.160 --> 42:36.020
One more and and again, we don't know how many of those we're gonna make they're they're soft there. They look comfortable

42:36.020 --> 42:42.920
Do we know that they're soft? Have we felt we before I have been assured that they are soft

42:42.920 --> 42:49.840
What if they're like pinecone rough? What if they're scaled? What if they're scaly? What if they're actually chainmail? Yes

42:51.320 --> 42:52.760
That's an added

42:52.760 --> 42:59.600
Benefit, isn't it? Our shirts protect against the elements. So our shirts will either be baby soft or they'll they'll be protective

43:00.240 --> 43:02.740
Mm-hmm. I I think that I think that

43:03.400 --> 43:09.720
if you if you want a different style of t-shirt a lot of people have asked me they want t-shirt to say

43:10.100 --> 43:12.100
my walnut is a temple or

43:12.100 --> 43:14.100
they

43:14.500 --> 43:18.620
They say that some people wanted Lou bag that that shirt

43:20.340 --> 43:24.620
If these do well, we will we might do a second run with different different shirts

43:25.700 --> 43:28.580
But but these are the two on offer for right now

43:30.300 --> 43:32.300
So that that's that

43:33.460 --> 43:38.820
Okay, so we've also got a a iPhone iPod app

43:38.820 --> 43:43.100
It is my brother my brother and me the app experience

43:43.660 --> 43:48.180
It's a you search for it on iTunes in B&B a.m. And I'm

43:49.020 --> 43:51.860
We're gonna put a link up under the buy stuff section

43:52.740 --> 43:56.620
As soon as the show's over so you can go there and and get it if you want it

43:56.620 --> 44:03.860
What's what's got involved in that app spear? What's all involved? Well, you got access to every show every episode

44:04.820 --> 44:06.820
You can download

44:06.820 --> 44:09.860
art from the shows and use them as

44:11.900 --> 44:15.060
Wallpapers you got that you can

44:18.460 --> 44:26.660
Get some extras. Oh, there's at least one extra. Well, we're gonna have you know some some bonus content up there

44:26.660 --> 44:29.300
We have one little audio clip right now that I put up

44:29.820 --> 44:33.580
It won't be anything too big because we know a lot of people don't have

44:33.580 --> 44:37.300
iPhones and we don't want to let make everybody feel left out

44:37.300 --> 44:40.300
But we do want to do a little something for the people that spent that though

44:40.300 --> 44:45.420
Amy the one that's super funny. I thought it was super funny. You had me rollin dog

44:45.420 --> 44:50.780
Oh, did I have your own you have me straight rollin? You have me low nice rollin rollin rollin

44:51.420 --> 44:53.420

A lot of people have been asking me about an Android app. It seriously is so out of our hands

45:07.340 --> 45:12.140
This is just a service that lives in our podcast provider provides. So totally up to them

45:13.580 --> 45:19.180
Whether or not you you you will be able to get down on Android eventually. We have like no control over this
