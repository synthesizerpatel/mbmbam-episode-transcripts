00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:50.000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to a much more distinguished My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

00:50.640 --> 00:54.640
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:54.640 --> 01:00.400
Salutations. I am your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. Now, let me sip this tea.

01:02.400 --> 01:06.880
Kindest, warmest greetings and regards. I'm Professor Griffin McElroy.

01:07.840 --> 01:08.480
Professor.

01:09.280 --> 01:14.160
And my voice sounds different, not because I'm sick, but because I'm distinguished and

01:14.160 --> 01:19.680
talking to you through a mahogany pipe full of rich and sweet tobacco.

01:19.680 --> 01:27.760
Yes. We are, of course, a little different because now we are, how you say, authors.

01:28.800 --> 01:33.600
We've been on a book tour, as they say in the biz.

01:33.600 --> 01:38.080
We've gone through the change that happens once you are published. It's called Puberty.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.160
Puberty? Because we've been public.

01:40.160 --> 01:40.720
That's very good.

01:40.720 --> 01:43.120
Thank you very much.

01:43.120 --> 01:50.640
And now that you have seen we are number one New York Times bestselling authors

01:50.640 --> 01:54.960
on the paper book list, they make you mention that.

01:56.240 --> 01:57.920
And some people say-

01:57.920 --> 02:01.760
Yeah, a lot of people would say paperback, but when you're a number one author,

02:01.760 --> 02:04.720
they let you say it incorrectly.

02:04.720 --> 02:08.640
So you have to forgive Justin for his confusion.

02:08.640 --> 02:14.960
We've had nothing to eat for the past 12 days, but fresh baguettes and the lack of

02:14.960 --> 02:18.640
vitamins is really starting to get- just cappuccinos and fresh baguettes.

02:18.640 --> 02:19.440
Cappuccinos and fresh baguettes.

02:19.440 --> 02:20.880
So many cappuccinos.

02:21.600 --> 02:25.040
Some people have said, so you're a bestselling author now, I have to tell them

02:25.040 --> 02:33.040
anyone on the list is a bestseller. I am a number one bestselling author of a book my dad mostly

02:33.040 --> 02:40.080
wrote called The Adventures of- and then they leave before my sentence is even finished.

02:40.080 --> 02:44.080
I went to college for five years because I got a D in Spanish.

02:48.160 --> 02:51.520
Anybody can be a New York Times bestselling author.

02:51.520 --> 02:56.560
I mean, fucking literally anybody can just let their dad write ones of a book.

02:58.160 --> 03:00.160
Yeah, get a really talented artist to do a lot of pictures.

03:00.160 --> 03:03.360
Get an extremely talented artist to do the heavy lifting.

03:03.360 --> 03:07.120
So nobody notices it's a version of your podcast that you did about-

03:07.120 --> 03:08.400
That they've already heard.

03:08.400 --> 03:09.440
That they've already heard.

03:10.080 --> 03:11.440
Oh my God.

03:11.440 --> 03:14.160
Those baguettes taste the same either way, don't they?

03:16.480 --> 03:22.160
It's fine to be on the New York Times bestselling list for paperbacks.

03:22.160 --> 03:22.800
That's fine.

03:22.800 --> 03:34.160
But I didn't write 15% of this book for the money because when you split it five ways,

03:34.160 --> 03:35.280
there isn't a lot.

03:35.280 --> 03:37.920
But the other thing is I didn't write this book for money.

03:37.920 --> 03:38.960
I wrote it for a claim.

03:38.960 --> 03:45.200
I want to be on the list of- is there one that's like fanciest books,

03:45.200 --> 03:47.680
like our favorite books for this fancy time?

03:47.680 --> 03:48.560
Bestselling book.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.000
Uh-huh.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.120
Yeah, I'll say this about the book.

03:51.120 --> 03:58.480
It's got a lot of great jokes, great story, very cool art, some real badass fights.

03:59.520 --> 04:01.680
The smell is unremarkable.

04:01.680 --> 04:07.440
The smell, there's no sort of leathery notes, no smells of rich tobacco like this very fine

04:07.440 --> 04:10.480
pipe I've been smoking for a while, which again explains the voice.

04:11.280 --> 04:17.280
And yeah, I suggested to the publisher that we get some sort of scent spray,

04:17.280 --> 04:21.200
some sort of body spray that we could sort of get on the books.

04:21.200 --> 04:24.400
But they said it would be a big soggy mess.

04:26.080 --> 04:27.840
Man, I sound fucking terrible, huh?

04:27.840 --> 04:29.120
I think you sound great.

04:29.120 --> 04:31.280
No, I sound like a fucking human didgeridoo.

04:32.480 --> 04:39.360
I wrote 15% of a book that mostly my daddy wrote because I'm hoping it opens some doors

04:39.360 --> 04:45.680
for me, specifically the door to the 33 Club at Disneyland.

04:45.680 --> 04:51.120
That's really why I wrote, I spent two years sort of working on this book just because

04:51.120 --> 04:53.600
I want to go to the 33 Club in Disneyland.

04:53.600 --> 04:56.080
It is literally the only thing that I want in my life.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.120
I have two life goals.

04:59.120 --> 05:02.560
One, get season three of Pete and Pete out on DVD.

05:02.560 --> 05:04.960
Two, get into the 33 Club.

05:04.960 --> 05:08.880
My whole thing was that I just wanted to get, the New York Times list is great.

05:08.880 --> 05:14.000
We also placed number seven on the USA Today list and that was where I really wanted to

05:14.000 --> 05:17.280
land was above Dan Brown.

05:17.840 --> 05:20.240
And we did that by one spot with a bullet.

05:20.240 --> 05:21.440
He was number eight.

05:21.440 --> 05:25.680
And so it allowed me to finally say out loud, eat my ass, Dan Brown.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.840
Huff my shorts, Dan Brown.

05:27.840 --> 05:28.560
I did it.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.000
Here's a Da Vinci code for you.

05:30.000 --> 05:30.960
I beat your book.

05:30.960 --> 05:32.640
Dan Brown had to accept it.

05:32.640 --> 05:34.080
Yeah, he got nothing to do about it.

05:34.080 --> 05:37.200
Here's a Da Vinci code for you.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.600
Up, up, down, down, B-A, eat my ass.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.160
I beat you.

05:40.160 --> 05:42.320
And there's nothing you can do about it.

05:42.320 --> 05:44.640
Hey Dan Brown, solve my dick.

05:44.640 --> 05:45.600
Hey, solve my dick.

05:45.600 --> 05:46.640
Tom Hanks is mine now.

05:46.640 --> 05:48.640
Katharine Stata-Jones is mine now.

05:48.640 --> 05:49.120
Mine.

05:49.760 --> 05:52.080
Is Stevie King with your book The Outsider?

05:52.080 --> 05:57.520
Sure, it's been out for a few months now and a lot of people have bought it already, but hey.

05:57.520 --> 06:01.360
So we're going to be fucking insufferable for a little bit, but I promise you that

06:01.360 --> 06:04.080
The Shine is going to come off the Apple eventually.

06:04.080 --> 06:08.160
I will say I have noticed that there are some books on that bestseller list where it's like

06:08.160 --> 06:10.800
weeks on the list like 48, 72.

06:12.160 --> 06:14.640
I expect to be off it by next week.

06:14.640 --> 06:17.360
There's no questione in my mind.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.920
We are off that motherfucker by next week.

06:20.640 --> 06:26.320
There's no conceivable reality that the world has not righted itself.

06:27.680 --> 06:32.320
The sound you heard last Tuesday was a bunch of glasses being pushed up Moses like,

06:32.320 --> 06:39.440
Oh no, how could they? Please, everyone, buy regular books.

06:39.440 --> 06:44.640
Yeah, by next week you'll just hear a loud slide whistle as we slide back down to the bottom.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.880
A loud academic sigh of relief.

06:48.880 --> 06:49.440
It's great.

06:49.440 --> 06:55.200
I got really nervous for a second when you said that, Juice, because I have done a lot of press

06:55.200 --> 07:00.960
since the big announcement where I called our book the Titanic of books because I thought it

07:00.960 --> 07:08.080
was going to stay, but now I realize that can still be true in a way, but just referring to

07:08.080 --> 07:09.920
a different sort of Titanic.

07:09.920 --> 07:10.960
The real one.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.560
Oh boy, we should get going.

07:12.560 --> 07:16.000
I think I've got probably about 45 minutes of voice juice in me.

07:16.720 --> 07:18.480
Delicious voice juice.

07:19.280 --> 07:22.720
Not gross at all is what it says on the label.

07:23.520 --> 07:28.000
Let's all take a sip of voice juice and enjoy out kidding aside.

07:28.720 --> 07:30.560
Thank you for if you're listening.

07:30.560 --> 07:34.240
It's unfucking believable like y'all have come out and supported us in the past,

07:34.240 --> 07:37.280
but like this is this is obviously new echelon.

07:37.280 --> 07:39.360
It feels like I can kind of be honest.

07:39.360 --> 07:45.840
It feels like less this gesture in particular feels like less a supportive

07:45.840 --> 07:49.120
move for us and more of a prank on earth.

07:49.120 --> 07:54.080
Like it feels like the like you're like you're trolling earth, which is great.

07:54.080 --> 07:57.280
Like no, no, no complaints here.

07:57.280 --> 07:58.240
Uh, here we go.

07:58.240 --> 08:03.200
Let's help earth on a break from work today while cycling down a fairly

08:03.200 --> 08:04.080
well-traveled road.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.080
I found a wallet brothers.

08:06.080 --> 08:09.440
This wallet was stacked trying to do the right thing.

08:09.440 --> 08:10.480
I picked up the wallet.

08:10.480 --> 08:15.600
I found an ID there in and immediately sent the owner a message on Facebook so

08:15.600 --> 08:19.920
that I could return the seriously comically overpacked wallet.

08:19.920 --> 08:23.520
They're very they really want to reinforce.

08:23.520 --> 08:24.960
This is a thick wallet.

08:25.440 --> 08:26.880
Here's the thing upon trying to work.

08:26.880 --> 08:31.280
Upon trying to work, I discovered that I too had lost the wallet.

08:31.280 --> 08:32.400
Oh my God.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.520
No, come on.

08:33.520 --> 08:34.080
Oh no.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.440
I traced back over my bike route to no avail.

08:37.440 --> 08:42.640
The owner hasn't yet responded to my message, but brothers, what do I do?

08:42.640 --> 08:43.280
And he does.

08:43.280 --> 08:44.800
Oh my God.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.400
Holy fucking shit.

08:47.440 --> 08:50.240
That's from a properly panicking in Portland.

08:50.240 --> 08:54.640
That's the worst story I've ever heard in my entire life.

08:54.640 --> 08:55.760
This is the end.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.880
That's the worst thing I've ever heard in my entire life.

08:58.880 --> 09:01.680
It's the worst imaginable situation.

09:01.680 --> 09:03.520
That's the worst thing.

09:03.520 --> 09:08.000
There is no way for you to respond when this person responds to you

09:08.000 --> 09:10.640
without sounding like you've decided to keep the wallet.

09:11.360 --> 09:12.320
There is no way.

09:14.400 --> 09:14.960
Wow.

09:14.960 --> 09:15.600
Fuck.

09:15.600 --> 09:16.080
All right.

09:16.080 --> 09:16.960
Let's all right.

09:16.960 --> 09:20.320
Now we've we've indulged ourselves in this panic.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.800
Sometimes it feels good to sort of be part of the panic,

09:22.800 --> 09:26.000
but now let's see if we can't help them dig out.

09:26.560 --> 09:27.840
The truth ain't gonna cut it.

09:27.840 --> 09:29.120
Truth will not set you free.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.640
Truth will put you jail.

09:30.640 --> 09:31.520
Actually this one.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.920
Because truth will sound like a lie?

09:36.480 --> 09:36.800
Yeah.

09:37.920 --> 09:41.360
Now you had some time at that wallet and it is important that you start right now.

09:41.360 --> 09:44.160
You should have started immediately as soon as you realized that you forgot.

09:44.160 --> 09:47.440
Start sort of writing down everything you know about the wallet.

09:47.440 --> 09:51.280
I'm talking about get a fucking professional sketch artist in there

09:51.280 --> 09:53.760
and you start describing everything about the wallet.

09:53.760 --> 09:59.680
Color, make, material, model, monogram maybe,

09:59.680 --> 10:03.520
contents, cards, library, credit, identification.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.800
How stacked was it?

10:04.800 --> 10:06.000
How stacked was it?

10:06.000 --> 10:08.160
And when you say that, are you talking about money

10:08.160 --> 10:11.040
or are you saying like it had like a sexy bod?

10:11.040 --> 10:14.240
I'm not entirely sure, but you need to start putting all this together.

10:14.240 --> 10:15.600
You have, I would estimate,

10:17.040 --> 10:18.160
it depends on when you sent this in,

10:18.160 --> 10:21.680
but I would say about 48 hours to completely recreate this wallet.

10:21.680 --> 10:24.240
You're gonna have some trouble in the identification department.

10:24.240 --> 10:26.320
You're gonna have some trouble in the credit card department.

10:26.320 --> 10:29.200
This will be the first sort of white hat credit card fraud

10:29.200 --> 10:31.120
I've ever heard of in my entire life.

10:32.560 --> 10:34.960
But that's literally, that's it.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.120
That is all like you're gonna need a forger.

10:37.120 --> 10:38.800
You're gonna need an architect.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.440
You're gonna need to inception the fuck out of this situation

10:41.440 --> 10:43.760
because you are in way too deep.

10:43.760 --> 10:47.600
There's also a possibility that this wallet is cursed

10:47.600 --> 10:50.400
and maybe like once it gets a certain distance away

10:50.400 --> 10:52.560
from its permanent location,

10:52.560 --> 10:55.840
it just like disapparates and returns there.

10:55.840 --> 10:56.720
Oh my God.

10:56.720 --> 10:57.200
You know what I mean?

10:57.200 --> 11:00.400
Like this wallet can't leave where you found it

11:00.400 --> 11:02.800
because that's where that wallet was murdered

11:03.360 --> 11:07.200
in a gruesome fashion over 50 years ago.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.160
Yeah, my wallet, you found my wallet.

11:10.160 --> 11:14.160
It's got tickets to the red legs game.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.800
It's, I lost that wallet 50 years ago.

11:16.800 --> 11:19.760
The Washington sentinels were et cetera, et cetera.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.920
If you don't share this podcast episode 10 times

11:21.920 --> 11:22.880
in the next 10 minutes,

11:22.880 --> 11:25.200
then the wallet curse is gonna spread to your wallet.

11:25.200 --> 11:25.520
Yeah.

11:26.080 --> 11:27.200
It happened to my dad.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.400
What's in your wallet?

11:28.400 --> 11:29.520
A ghost.

11:29.520 --> 11:29.840
Yeah.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.440
Oh man, I've been trying to cook up some like,

11:33.440 --> 11:35.920
I was gonna swoop in with something practical.

11:35.920 --> 11:39.840
There's fucking literally nothing you can do.

11:39.840 --> 11:42.240
You know what's so wild about it is that the person,

11:42.240 --> 11:45.280
this person, okay, person one lost the wallet.

11:45.280 --> 11:48.400
Person two found the wallet, then they lost it.

11:48.960 --> 11:52.560
Person one, when they find out about this latest development

11:52.560 --> 11:55.040
is gonna be very, very frustrated

11:55.040 --> 11:56.640
by our question asker here

11:56.640 --> 12:01.600
and they'll have literally no cause to ethically speaking.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.080
Like they're not worse off than they were

12:04.080 --> 12:05.920
before this person tried to do a nice thing.

12:06.720 --> 12:09.840
You're just being punished by the universe

12:09.840 --> 12:11.200
for trying to help somebody.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.320
It's unfathomable.

12:12.320 --> 12:14.240
If nothing else, I will actually say

12:14.240 --> 12:17.600
that person who lost the wallet originally is better off

12:17.600 --> 12:20.320
because at least now question asker can say,

12:20.960 --> 12:24.400
when I last saw it, there was still money in it.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.400
So you still have hope.

12:27.120 --> 12:27.440
Yeah.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.440
Did you take a picture of yourself with the wallet

12:29.440 --> 12:31.040
in today's newspaper?

12:31.040 --> 12:33.760
Just to let them know that it is doing okay.

12:33.760 --> 12:36.000
But maybe your early edition

12:36.000 --> 12:38.560
and you stole the wallet money yesterday.

12:38.560 --> 12:39.440
Think about it.

12:39.440 --> 12:41.040
I'm flipping on this a little bit.

12:41.040 --> 12:42.400
I think you messaged them and say like,

12:42.400 --> 12:43.680
ah shit, I lost it too.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.040
And if they say, what the fuck?

12:45.040 --> 12:46.880
You say, you don't really have a leg to stand on.

12:46.880 --> 12:49.040
You are also a wallet loser.

12:49.040 --> 12:50.400
So you know how it feels.

12:50.400 --> 12:53.040
Like, you know I feel bad right now because you feel bad

12:53.040 --> 12:54.560
because you also lost the wallet.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.240
I just did the same thing you did.

12:56.240 --> 12:57.600
Maybe there are other people out there

12:57.600 --> 12:59.920
who have lost this wallet and we can find each other

13:00.560 --> 13:02.240
and like just console each other

13:02.240 --> 13:04.160
and maybe form some sort of like sisterhood

13:04.160 --> 13:06.240
of the traveling pants club, you know?

13:06.960 --> 13:07.920
Yeah, well.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.280
Friendhood of the lost wallets.

13:09.920 --> 13:10.160
Sure.

13:10.800 --> 13:11.760
Is that clear?

13:11.760 --> 13:14.000
Yeah, how about it? I mean, you broke up very badly in Skype.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.440
I don't know if that happened for juice too.

13:15.440 --> 13:16.000
Yeah, it did.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.440
But I'm just gonna, you know what?

13:17.440 --> 13:20.080
I'm just gonna agree with whatever Travis just said.

13:20.080 --> 13:22.560
It's a real roll the dice moment, but I'm gonna do it.

13:22.560 --> 13:25.040
Whatever you said, Travis, absolutely.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.000
It was good.

13:26.000 --> 13:26.880
I stand by it.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.440
I just said that you broke up in Skype.

13:29.440 --> 13:30.720
We're not using Skype right now

13:30.720 --> 13:32.480
because it updated all of us to the new version

13:32.480 --> 13:33.680
without our consent.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.120
And we don't usually like sort of complain

13:35.120 --> 13:36.880
about tech stuff on here.

13:36.880 --> 13:38.320
We're not, you know, reply all,

13:38.320 --> 13:40.880
but that's not really what they do on the show either.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.960
They just complain about their Skype calls.

13:42.960 --> 13:45.360
Yeah, it is the worst.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.160
I don't know if anybody from Microsoft listens to the show.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.920
It is the worst I've ever seen an application be tweaked.

13:52.880 --> 13:54.480
We literally could not use it.

13:54.480 --> 13:57.120
Like we couldn't use it because it wouldn't do the call good.

13:57.120 --> 13:58.640
Like it wouldn't, not only do the call good,

13:58.640 --> 13:59.920
it wouldn't do the call.

13:59.920 --> 14:00.640
It's the worst.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.080
It's fucking so bad.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.200
This is for nobody.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.520
Maybe we need to do a reply all crossover

14:05.520 --> 14:07.520
where we just like, please fix Skype.

14:07.520 --> 14:08.560
Please don't fix Skype.

14:08.560 --> 14:09.920
Just go back to destroy it.

14:09.920 --> 14:11.440
Original Skype wasn't even that great,

14:11.440 --> 14:13.360
but we could at least use it to record a podcast

14:13.360 --> 14:14.160
three times a week.

14:14.160 --> 14:17.600
Anyway, here's a Yahoo that was sent in by so many people.

14:17.600 --> 14:17.920
Thank you.

14:17.920 --> 14:19.520
It's by Yahoo Answers user Donald.

14:19.520 --> 14:20.320
He looks so cool.

14:20.320 --> 14:23.360
He's wearing like shiny, like reflective sunglasses

14:23.360 --> 14:25.840
and just a nice strong face.

14:25.840 --> 14:29.360
Says, in the TV show Friends,

14:31.280 --> 14:32.800
what was the point of Ross?

14:34.800 --> 14:35.120
Okay.

14:35.760 --> 14:39.440
He was so cringe and had stupid hair.

14:39.440 --> 14:40.400
Now that seems mean.

14:40.400 --> 14:43.520
I wish I hadn't seen the last part of it.

14:44.160 --> 14:45.600
He did not have stupid hair.

14:46.160 --> 14:46.400
Yeah.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.960
I also just like despise the word cringe

14:48.960 --> 14:50.880
and how it's used in the internet,

14:50.880 --> 14:52.080
but it brings up a good point.

14:52.640 --> 14:53.920
What was the point of Ross?

14:53.920 --> 14:55.360
What was Ross's whole point?

14:55.360 --> 14:57.120
Like what was the point of him?

14:57.120 --> 14:58.640
Well, he was the every man, Griffin.

14:59.280 --> 15:01.520
Well, he was the surrogate.

15:01.520 --> 15:04.000
Well, see, we look at the Joey,

15:05.040 --> 15:08.800
your quintessential, the Joey and the Joey is there.

15:08.800 --> 15:12.640
He's charming, but perhaps a little bit,

15:14.560 --> 15:17.840
I would say not the sharpest, you know, sharpest spoon.

15:17.840 --> 15:19.440
Yeah, sort of a goof,

15:19.440 --> 15:21.280
but with like a lot of sort of raw,

15:21.280 --> 15:22.800
just potent sexual energy.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.200
And I suppose Ross is a foil to that.

15:25.200 --> 15:25.520
Yes.

15:25.520 --> 15:29.280
And maybe Joey's sexual energy is at times terrible.

15:29.280 --> 15:29.440
Yeah.

15:29.440 --> 15:30.880
And he's a terrible person.

15:30.880 --> 15:33.280
He loved to eat sandwiches.

15:33.280 --> 15:36.880
And Ross, I don't think we ever saw him eat even one sandwich.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.800
Well, and with your Chandlers,

15:39.360 --> 15:41.680
Chandlers tend to make the jokes.

15:42.560 --> 15:45.280
He would say things that I sometimes think

15:45.280 --> 15:46.720
he didn't actually believe.

15:46.720 --> 15:46.960
What?

15:46.960 --> 15:47.920
Yeah, I know.

15:47.920 --> 15:49.200
It's just a cool thing.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.960
And then he fell in love with Monica

15:52.000 --> 15:53.680
and Ross never fell in love.

15:53.680 --> 15:56.080
So there's another sort of difference

15:56.080 --> 15:57.920
between him and the other boys.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.760
Now your Monicas are very driven.

16:00.320 --> 16:02.080
Monica has a lot of drive, yeah.

16:02.640 --> 16:05.680
Very clean, organized.

16:05.680 --> 16:07.280
Falls in love with Chandler, which is something

16:07.280 --> 16:09.600
that her, I guess, brother Ross never does.

16:09.600 --> 16:10.160
Correct.

16:10.160 --> 16:11.600
My daughter was actually-

16:11.600 --> 16:12.640
I'm not done.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.280
You gotta let Travis finish, Justin.

16:15.280 --> 16:18.480
Now your Phoebe's, they're a bit of a free spirit, Griffin.

16:18.480 --> 16:20.080
Can't tie them down.

16:20.080 --> 16:23.520
Ross, I would say, is not a free spirit.

16:23.520 --> 16:27.280
Whatever you got is a completely captured spirit.

16:27.280 --> 16:30.080
Now your Rachel's, this is where it gets a little tricky.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.840
They have great hair.

16:31.840 --> 16:32.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:32.800 --> 16:33.680
Reductionist.

16:33.680 --> 16:37.520
Ross tried to love Rachel, didn't he?

16:37.520 --> 16:37.760
Yeah.

16:38.320 --> 16:40.800
But she didn't do it back because he was such a goober

16:40.800 --> 16:43.760
and he had the monkey and was very cringe.

16:43.760 --> 16:48.080
Now the monkey, your Marcel's, they are the greatest of us.

16:48.080 --> 16:48.800
Yeah, sure.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.640
They are truly the best part.

16:50.640 --> 16:53.440
Played by Crystal, who I recently met.

16:53.440 --> 16:54.000
It's true.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.880
So what's Ross's fucking deal then?

16:56.880 --> 16:58.960
My daughter was born under the Monica sign

16:58.960 --> 17:02.720
and it's been a real struggle raising her

17:02.720 --> 17:07.200
because she's had a bob since she was about 18 months

17:07.200 --> 17:13.120
and she's been organizing our home for the better part of her life

17:13.760 --> 17:15.440
and we've had to grow to accept it.

17:16.240 --> 17:17.520
That's who she is as a person.

17:17.520 --> 17:19.200
That's her sign.

17:19.200 --> 17:22.880
Travis, real quick, can you do Stinky the cat before you wrap up

17:22.880 --> 17:25.200
because I hear a lot about that character.

17:25.200 --> 17:29.280
So this is the only true redeemable character

17:29.280 --> 17:30.800
I would say out of the entire show

17:30.800 --> 17:35.360
because here's the thing, Friends doesn't super hold up super good

17:35.360 --> 17:39.520
in regards to like gay panic and transphobia

17:39.520 --> 17:41.600
and fatphobia and all of those things.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.840
But the cat that smells bad.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.200
Classic.

17:45.200 --> 17:52.640
Continues to be, I would say, the greatest maybe character

17:53.280 --> 17:56.160
because you remember all the dream sequences

17:56.160 --> 17:59.120
where the cat with the bad smell would appear

17:59.120 --> 18:03.120
and discuss the day's events with one or more of the friends

18:03.120 --> 18:05.440
and be like, so what do you think you learned today?

18:05.440 --> 18:09.760
And that was really where I think the heart of the show rested.

18:09.760 --> 18:11.360
And then, of course, there's the classic episode.

18:11.360 --> 18:13.040
I think it was their 100th episode

18:13.040 --> 18:16.080
where the monkey and the smelly cat battled.

18:16.080 --> 18:17.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.880
And I really think the show sucked after that.

18:20.880 --> 18:22.480
Yeah, it sucked shit.

18:22.480 --> 18:26.160
What I'm struggling with is, I believe it was James Lipton

18:26.160 --> 18:30.480
James Lipton theorized that there were something like eight

18:31.040 --> 18:36.000
sort of archetypes that every sort of literary work must fill.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.480
And there's the one who eats a sandwich, which is Joey.

18:41.360 --> 18:42.880
The one who loves Monica.

18:43.520 --> 18:44.800
In this one, it's Chandler.

18:45.680 --> 18:47.760
Monica is one of them.

18:49.600 --> 18:52.560
Fun, flirty, free spirit with the smelly cat song

18:52.560 --> 18:55.520
is obviously Phoebe.

18:56.240 --> 18:59.360
And then sort of the cool one, I think is Rachel.

18:59.360 --> 19:00.640
Okay, there it is.

19:00.640 --> 19:00.960
Yes.

19:01.600 --> 19:05.040
There is no dinosaur expert.

19:06.640 --> 19:09.440
He seems completely, he's a skin tag.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.240
Cut him off.

19:10.240 --> 19:11.760
We need five friends.

19:11.760 --> 19:15.920
I read in the TV guide that for the first four seasons

19:15.920 --> 19:18.480
they didn't pay David Schwimmer to be there.

19:18.480 --> 19:19.200
Oh, wow.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.120
Yeah, he just, he kept showing up.

19:21.120 --> 19:24.640
And like at first, if you watch the first episode,

19:24.640 --> 19:26.240
he only has one line.

19:26.240 --> 19:26.800
Yeah.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.920
And the audience just liked his energy so much

19:29.920 --> 19:32.080
that the next episode they gave him two lines.

19:32.080 --> 19:33.840
And then the next episode they gave him four lines.

19:33.840 --> 19:38.160
And by the end of the series, he had 6 million lines per episode.

19:38.160 --> 19:42.480
Yeah, it's originally supposed to be Chandler, Joey, Phoebe,

19:42.480 --> 19:44.320
Rachel, Monica, Gunther.

19:44.320 --> 19:46.960
And Gunther was supposed to be sixth friend.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.480
And his whole thing, he was the one who had all the swords.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.680
Yeah.

19:51.680 --> 19:53.040
But the audience just hated him.

19:53.040 --> 19:54.000
The audience hated him.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.200
And they wanted him to be sort of a recipient

19:57.200 --> 20:01.600
of constant unearned scorn from the other six friends.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.720
I hate this show.

20:02.720 --> 20:04.080
Ross is half dinosaur.

20:04.960 --> 20:05.200
Yeah.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.720
All right, all right, all right.

20:06.720 --> 20:10.160
He knew a lot about him and everyone wondered why.

20:10.160 --> 20:13.360
And it was one of the longest running mysteries in TV history

20:13.360 --> 20:15.440
is why Ross knew so much about dinosaurs.

20:15.440 --> 20:19.920
And then on the last episode, they revealed it's

20:19.920 --> 20:22.480
because he's half dinosaur the whole time.

20:22.480 --> 20:23.280
And you know what?

20:23.280 --> 20:27.520
Actually, I don't want to brag, but if you watch True, I knew that.

20:27.520 --> 20:30.560
I knew that was going to be it because you could find little clues.

20:30.560 --> 20:33.040
Like that scene where he comes back to Rachel

20:33.040 --> 20:35.680
and he's standing in the door and it's raining, you know?

20:35.680 --> 20:38.880
And you can see his tail waving around behind him.

20:38.880 --> 20:41.920
Yeah, or the scene where he cuts Tom Selleck's belly open

20:41.920 --> 20:43.360
with his razor sharp talon.

20:43.920 --> 20:48.480
Just completely out from neck to navel.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.720
Just really cracks him, cracks him wide open.

20:50.720 --> 20:53.440
And then he spits venom on Chandler.

20:53.440 --> 20:55.920
And Chandler's like, I like this.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.840
Could I be any more blind?

20:57.840 --> 20:58.720
Yes.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.800
I just hate Ross so much.

21:00.800 --> 21:03.600
It would be better if Ross didn't.

21:04.800 --> 21:05.040
Yeah.

21:05.040 --> 21:05.440
You know?

21:05.440 --> 21:05.680
Yeah.

21:06.480 --> 21:08.960
Yeah, just every time I watch it, I'd be like, could you not?

21:10.080 --> 21:13.280
What if, okay, I would like to pitch a reboot of Friends.

21:14.240 --> 21:17.280
And you take all the same footage from the original series,

21:17.280 --> 21:19.440
but anytime Ross is on screen,

21:19.440 --> 21:23.040
you replace it with David Schwimmer now responding like,

21:23.040 --> 21:25.200
hey, that's a terrible thing to say.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.920
Or like, how do we afford these apartments?

21:27.920 --> 21:28.560
That's good.

21:28.560 --> 21:30.800
I want to redo it as a mecha anime.

21:30.800 --> 21:33.040
And so they all have sort of different mechas

21:33.040 --> 21:34.480
that lock together Voltron style.

21:34.480 --> 21:37.360
So like Joey's like a tiger who's the left leg.

21:38.080 --> 21:40.480
Chandler's like a lion who's the right leg.

21:40.480 --> 21:43.440
Phoebe's like an ostrich who's the torso.

21:44.240 --> 21:47.040
Sorry, she'd be a smelly cat, which is like torso and head.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.160
And then Monica and Rachel.

21:48.160 --> 21:48.960
You mean the butt?

21:48.960 --> 21:50.720
Well, the butt is part of the torso, Jess.

21:50.720 --> 21:51.280
Keep up.

21:51.280 --> 21:52.000
Okay.

21:52.000 --> 21:52.240
Yeah.

21:52.240 --> 21:54.400
And then Monica and Rachel would be the two arms.

21:54.400 --> 21:58.800
And then Ross would come in also as a leg and he'd be like,

21:58.800 --> 22:01.280
can I, hey guys, let me snap in.

22:01.280 --> 22:03.600
And they're like, we're good.

22:03.600 --> 22:05.360
They only need five of us.

22:05.360 --> 22:07.360
We made the whole robot already, Ross.

22:07.360 --> 22:08.560
You have no point.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.240
Now sweep up, Ross.

22:10.240 --> 22:11.600
Clean up our mecha leavings.

22:13.280 --> 22:14.080
How about another question?

22:14.080 --> 22:15.200
How would you guys feel about that?

22:15.200 --> 22:15.680
That's good.

22:15.680 --> 22:17.840
I feel bad for dunking on Schwimmer like that.

22:17.840 --> 22:19.200
Schwimmer's cool as hell.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.360
I have no beef with Schwimmer.

22:21.360 --> 22:23.440
Schwimmer is just trying to make his nut.

22:23.440 --> 22:25.920
He's great on Homecoming from Gimlet Media.

22:25.920 --> 22:27.040
How about a question?

22:27.040 --> 22:27.520
Yeah, man.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.360
I've been looking for the email for 30 seconds.

22:29.360 --> 22:30.640
Just give me a grip.

22:33.360 --> 22:35.920
Just fucking ran my mouth a bunch of blah blah.

22:36.560 --> 22:39.120
Just a bunch of blah blah blah trying to find the email.

22:40.080 --> 22:44.320
Last time I lost it, I searched for wallet and then I found it again.

22:44.320 --> 22:49.120
One of my neighbors stopped by today to say she's having a big birthday party on the weekend.

22:49.120 --> 22:53.120
She told me there'll be a lot of guests coming, so they'll probably make a lot of noise

22:53.120 --> 22:55.840
from the sheer volume of people, from music.

22:55.840 --> 22:58.320
Plus, her guests might park all on the street.

22:58.320 --> 23:00.960
She told me that the expected start and end times of this party.

23:00.960 --> 23:05.280
Gave me her cell phone number, told me to text if there were any major issues, and then left.

23:05.280 --> 23:08.640
Is it weird she gave me all this information but didn't invite me to the party?

23:08.640 --> 23:13.840
Or am I weird for thinking it's weird when she was maybe just trying to be considerate?

23:13.840 --> 23:16.000
What's the right way to respond to someone knocking on your door

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
to tell you you're not invited to their birthday?

23:18.000 --> 23:22.640
That's from Potential Party Crasher in Coquitlam.

23:26.240 --> 23:28.400
I don't think this is a thing, right?

23:29.600 --> 23:33.200
I've gotten this dropped by a few times in my life where they just let me know,

23:33.200 --> 23:37.280
hey, it's going to get loud and rowdy without extending the invitation.

23:37.280 --> 23:45.360
Maybe this is wrong-headed of me, but I don't know that I would be eager to go to this party

23:45.360 --> 23:49.760
where I wouldn't know anybody except for or possibly including my neighbor.

23:50.400 --> 23:54.000
Yeah, it's basically like this person has just said,

23:54.000 --> 23:59.280
hey, Justin, I'm going to have an area of earth that would be poisonous to you

23:59.280 --> 24:03.200
in your natural state, and I'm giving you permission to not

24:03.200 --> 24:07.120
put your physical mass into this poisonous area.

24:07.920 --> 24:12.400
I will also say it is nice of you to attribute this to them being considerate,

24:12.400 --> 24:16.080
but really this is them saying, please do not call the cops on us.

24:16.080 --> 24:16.560
Yeah, sure.

24:16.560 --> 24:25.200
Ah, the one thing I will say though is it would be so nice to get an invite to a next door party.

24:25.200 --> 24:25.760
It's so close.

24:25.760 --> 24:28.880
That's what I'm thinking about right now is I think I probably would go.

24:29.440 --> 24:30.720
It's right there.

24:30.720 --> 24:32.800
I can go mess up their house.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.600
And if I need to poop, I just go back home.

24:36.720 --> 24:38.160
This is the great party.

24:38.160 --> 24:40.640
Actually, now I'm mad because you could go there.

24:40.640 --> 24:43.200
You could eat all their chips, eat all their cool rancheritos,

24:43.200 --> 24:46.320
eat all their sea salt and vinegar Pringles.

24:46.320 --> 24:48.320
Oh, oh, yeah.

24:48.320 --> 24:48.720
Oh, yeah.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.000
Now we're talking.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.680
See what they're watching on TV.

24:51.680 --> 24:53.040
What are they watching on TV?

24:53.040 --> 24:56.400
Maybe set up a couple of webcams in their bedroom and then-

24:56.400 --> 24:59.760
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait.

24:59.760 --> 25:00.640
I misspoke.

25:01.440 --> 25:02.480
I misspoke.

25:02.480 --> 25:05.840
I said, I meant to say eat some sweet chili Doritos.

25:05.840 --> 25:08.640
And then you go back to your house if you get tired.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.080
And here's the wild thing.

25:10.080 --> 25:12.160
If you decide you want to do more party later,

25:12.720 --> 25:16.160
it sounds like this motherfucker is going to be rocking and rollicking all night long.

25:16.160 --> 25:18.240
Just go back over if you want some more party.

25:18.240 --> 25:19.440
This is great.

25:19.440 --> 25:23.120
I got this drop by an old house I lived at here in Austin.

25:23.760 --> 25:25.360
It's actually from a neighbor a couple of doors down,

25:27.200 --> 25:28.640
maybe even three doors down.

25:28.640 --> 25:30.880
And they came by just to give us a heads up.

25:30.880 --> 25:32.480
Like, hey, we have this party every year.

25:32.480 --> 25:34.000
It's like a big crawfish boil.

25:34.560 --> 25:36.720
And it's like all day.

25:36.720 --> 25:38.080
And so it's going to get a little bit loud.

25:38.080 --> 25:39.280
Just wanted to give you the heads up.

25:39.280 --> 25:42.560
And I was very like, I was very forgiving.

25:42.560 --> 25:43.840
I was like, oh, that's totally fine.

25:43.840 --> 25:45.120
Thank you for the warning.

25:45.120 --> 25:46.320
I appreciate it.

25:46.320 --> 25:47.920
I hope everything goes well.

25:47.920 --> 25:51.600
And then day of about 400 people, I would say,

25:51.600 --> 25:55.040
just estimating based on the number of cars that appear on the street showed up.

25:55.040 --> 25:56.480
And they did the boil.

25:56.480 --> 26:00.320
And I would say from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.

26:00.320 --> 26:02.560
it was just nonstop live zydeco.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.000
Like nonstop live zydeco.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.920
Wow, that's a lot of zydeco.

26:05.920 --> 26:10.320
Yeah, with some real like fucking 12 foot high Marshall stacks

26:10.320 --> 26:14.320
just blasting that zydeco into my teeth, into my fillings,

26:15.440 --> 26:18.400
just shattering all the toilets in my house

26:18.400 --> 26:21.280
because of how loud and powerful the zydeco was.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.560
And I remember thinking like,

26:23.920 --> 26:26.400
I don't think I gave permission for this, right?

26:26.400 --> 26:30.560
Like we're talking about 10 hours of straight zydeco.

26:32.480 --> 26:34.400
I feel like maybe it was undersold a little bit.

26:35.120 --> 26:38.800
Yeah, I think that if zydeco is gonna play a part

26:38.800 --> 26:43.120
that is such a specific thing that you have been misled

26:43.120 --> 26:47.680
if they don't specifically say, yes, zydeco, it's happening.

26:47.680 --> 26:49.280
It's beautiful music, beautiful music.

26:49.280 --> 26:53.520
Loud 10 hours of it is not my favorite way to enjoy zydeco.

26:53.520 --> 26:57.760
I would say loud 10 hours of anything, you know?

26:57.760 --> 27:02.800
Like there's some 90 songs I enjoy very, very much,

27:02.800 --> 27:05.840
but if you played Lit's My Own Worst Enemy

27:05.840 --> 27:09.840
on a loop for 10 hours, I'd probably burn your house down.

27:09.840 --> 27:12.000
If you came over and said, hey, we're having a party over,

27:12.000 --> 27:13.920
400 people are gonna show up and we're gonna play

27:13.920 --> 27:17.200
nothing but nonstop billion decibel covers

27:17.200 --> 27:22.080
of zydeco style versions of Lit's My Own Worst Enemy.

27:22.080 --> 27:24.240
Lit's My Own Worst Enemy as if it was covered

27:24.240 --> 27:27.920
by an authentic New Orleans zydeco band.

27:27.920 --> 27:32.160
I would say, well, that's clearly not good.

27:34.080 --> 27:36.000
I really wish you wouldn't do that.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.040
There's nothing I can do about it

27:37.040 --> 27:38.640
because I'm not gonna fucking call the cops on you,

27:38.640 --> 27:41.840
but like, please, please, please don't.

27:41.840 --> 27:44.800
Let's, I tell you what, let's take a quick break.

27:45.520 --> 27:48.560
We'll go over to the Money Zone, get some cash,

27:49.280 --> 27:51.040
and then come back to the comedy after that.

27:51.040 --> 27:52.240
What do you think?

27:52.240 --> 27:54.480
Okay, follow me.

27:54.480 --> 27:55.200
Get in my pocket.

27:56.560 --> 27:57.840
My shirt pocket.

27:57.840 --> 27:59.200
I'm shrinking you down.

27:59.200 --> 28:00.800
This is the power of audio, folks.

28:00.800 --> 28:01.760
I'm shrinking you down.

28:02.720 --> 28:04.800
Oh, man, I found a toy car in here.

28:04.800 --> 28:05.760
I'm gonna get inside.

28:05.760 --> 28:06.400
That's for you.

28:06.400 --> 28:08.080
Oh, good, an M&M, I can.

28:08.080 --> 28:10.400
Someone's activating the toy car in my wallet.

28:11.280 --> 28:12.640
Vroom, vroom, I'm gonna drive out of here.

28:12.640 --> 28:14.320
You guys have noticed that toy cars,

28:14.320 --> 28:16.160
whenever somebody shrinks down in a movie

28:16.160 --> 28:17.520
and there's a toy car in it,

28:17.520 --> 28:19.920
it's always got working gas and brake pedals.

28:19.920 --> 28:21.920
Why the fuck?

28:21.920 --> 28:23.920
What the fuck are you talking about?

28:23.920 --> 28:25.360
Like in Stuart Little, right?

28:25.360 --> 28:28.240
This motherfucker climbs into a car and he drives it.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.640
A Matchbox car and he drives it.

28:30.640 --> 28:31.840
What the fuck?

28:31.840 --> 28:32.480
How?

28:32.480 --> 28:37.520
Why would, what sort of like bizarro serial killer toy maker

28:37.520 --> 28:39.600
is putting like working gas and brake pedals

28:39.600 --> 28:41.040
in his tiny cars for mice?

28:41.680 --> 28:42.640
It's nonsense.

28:43.200 --> 28:45.680
Yeah, Justin, thank you for finally finding

28:45.680 --> 28:48.080
the one plot hole in Stuart Little,

28:48.080 --> 28:49.760
the movie about a talking mouse.

28:49.760 --> 28:52.480
Come at me, Joss, or was it in my Shyamalan?

28:53.760 --> 28:55.680
I mean, could anybody actually hear the mouse?

28:57.840 --> 28:58.960
Oh my God, you're right.

28:58.960 --> 29:00.400
Yeah, I'm on some Rugrats shit.

29:00.400 --> 29:01.760
We have to go to the money zone.

29:01.760 --> 29:02.400
I'm there, this is it.

29:02.400 --> 29:03.440
I thought we were here.

29:03.440 --> 29:07.440
Today's sponsor is the DVD release of Stuart Little.

29:07.440 --> 29:08.960
I'm gonna get us into the monies again.

29:08.960 --> 29:22.800
Here comes our second transition into the money zone.

29:22.800 --> 29:24.560
I'm gonna tell you about Bull and Branch.

29:24.560 --> 29:24.800
Yes.

29:24.800 --> 29:25.040
Okay.

29:26.160 --> 29:28.160
Bull and Branch, changing the game.

29:28.160 --> 29:30.800
Every day, you know linens, you don't.

29:31.760 --> 29:34.320
Sorry, I didn't mean to get so aggressive there,

29:34.320 --> 29:38.800
but Bull and Branch, it's getting a good night's sleep

29:38.800 --> 29:41.600
is easier and more affordable than you think.

29:42.480 --> 29:45.040
And let me tell you, everything Bull and Branch makes

29:45.040 --> 29:49.600
from bedding to blankets is made from pure 100% organic.

29:49.600 --> 29:50.880
Diamonds!

29:50.880 --> 29:54.080
No, well, that wouldn't be comfortable.

29:54.080 --> 29:56.000
No, this is 100% organic cotton,

29:56.000 --> 29:57.920
which means that they start out super soft

29:57.920 --> 29:59.680
and they get even softer over time.

29:59.680 --> 30:01.280
None of that like breaking in like,

30:01.280 --> 30:03.760
oh, after you wash this the 30th time,

30:03.760 --> 30:04.880
it's good right away.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.640
They have thousands of five-star reviews

30:06.640 --> 30:08.720
and Forbes, Wall Street Journal and Fast Company

30:08.720 --> 30:10.240
are all talking about Bull and Branch.

30:11.360 --> 30:14.080
Shipping is free and you can try them for 30 nights

30:14.080 --> 30:15.360

30:39.440 --> 30:40.560
You know what feels good?

30:42.400 --> 30:44.080
I lived my entire life not really caring

30:44.080 --> 30:45.440
about what I put on my human body

30:45.440 --> 30:49.520
because I was, I don't know, I didn't give a shit

30:49.520 --> 30:52.560
or I didn't know and I didn't want to put it in the work,

30:52.560 --> 30:53.360
whatever the reason.

30:53.360 --> 30:54.880
I went through most of my life

30:54.880 --> 30:56.240
just putting whatever on my body.

30:56.240 --> 30:59.120
Then we started getting advertisements from Stitch Fix

30:59.120 --> 31:02.400
and they started sending me boxes of clothes for me to wear

31:02.400 --> 31:07.400
and it is so nice to, almost every time I dress

31:10.080 --> 31:12.000
in Stitch Fix clothing, I will get a compliment

31:12.000 --> 31:12.560
from somebody.

31:12.560 --> 31:14.800
It's like, hey, I love your shirt.

31:14.800 --> 31:17.600
Those are cool shoes or your pants are good

31:17.600 --> 31:19.680
and I'll say, thank you, it's Stitch Fix

31:19.680 --> 31:21.520
and it's almost become a joke at this point.

31:21.520 --> 31:24.320
When we do a show, if we look nice,

31:24.320 --> 31:26.560
it's probably all stuff from Stitch Fix

31:26.560 --> 31:29.520
that we are all wearing and it is a wonderful service.

31:29.520 --> 31:33.040
Run through our jacket, yeah, shirt, okay, pants.

31:33.040 --> 31:35.360
If you have ever seen a picture of me

31:35.360 --> 31:37.920
and thought that's a nice shirt, probably from Stitch Fix.

31:37.920 --> 31:40.240
You give them your sizes, your favorite styles

31:40.240 --> 31:42.320
and your budget and a personal stylist

31:42.320 --> 31:45.120
will select five brand new clothing items just for you

31:45.120 --> 31:46.800
and then they show up in a box.

31:46.800 --> 31:52.000
You try on everything and the stuff that you love,

31:52.560 --> 31:54.560
you keep, the stuff that you don't love,

31:54.560 --> 31:59.520
you put into a container that's got a prepaid

31:59.520 --> 32:01.920
for shipping label on it, you throw it in the bag

32:01.920 --> 32:05.200
and you ship it back to them no problem

32:05.200 --> 32:06.960
and you get a discount if you keep everything

32:07.680 --> 32:09.360
and that is very nice as well.

32:10.080 --> 32:12.640
Their hit rate is really good and just gets better

32:12.640 --> 32:15.840
because they learn from the stuff that you like

32:15.840 --> 32:17.600
and the stuff you don't like and they try to get closer

32:17.600 --> 32:20.240
to your personal style.

32:20.880 --> 32:22.800
My wife, Sydney, has very specific taste

32:22.800 --> 32:26.960
and she was unconvinced that they would be able to get her

32:27.920 --> 32:30.160
and we started Stitch Fix when she was pregnant

32:30.160 --> 32:34.480
and not only did they eventually figure out her taste

32:34.480 --> 32:39.440
pretty well, they sent clothing that was appropriately sized

32:39.440 --> 32:41.760
for where she was in her pregnancy.

32:41.760 --> 32:44.080
After we had the baby, they had already knew

32:44.080 --> 32:46.560
that she had had the baby and they started delivering clothes

32:46.560 --> 32:51.120
that were post-maternity wear, it's wild

32:51.120 --> 32:52.160
and it's a wonderful service.

32:52.160 --> 32:56.320
So stitchfix.com slash my brother

32:56.320 --> 32:57.920
is where you can get started right now.

32:57.920 --> 32:59.840
If you keep all five items you receive,

32:59.840 --> 33:03.680
you'll get 25% off your entire purchase.

33:03.680 --> 33:07.120
That's stitchfix.com slash my brother.

33:07.680 --> 33:09.600
I just wanna say as we're moving into the summer months,

33:09.600 --> 33:11.520
Stitch Fix has sent me a lot of shorts lately

33:11.520 --> 33:12.400
and they've all been good.

33:12.400 --> 33:14.480
I've never known how to buy shorts for myself.

33:14.480 --> 33:17.840
I have rid myself of all cargo shorts I've owned.

33:18.400 --> 33:19.840
That's it, they're gone.

33:19.840 --> 33:22.240
It's just nice Stitch Fix shorts now.

33:22.240 --> 33:24.480
It's the greatest thing anybody's ever done for me.

33:24.480 --> 33:27.680
And the greatest thing that anybody's ever done for Jason

33:27.680 --> 33:30.960
is to send this Jumbotron message over our airwaves.

33:30.960 --> 33:34.960
The person who sent it is Claire and it's for Jason.

33:34.960 --> 33:37.600
And Claire says, to our Dungeon Master, our best friend

33:37.600 --> 33:40.720
and our giant phase spider, Jason.

33:40.720 --> 33:42.240
Thank you for creating an excellent world

33:42.240 --> 33:44.160
for us to run around in and letting us adopt

33:44.160 --> 33:46.720
literally every adorable NPC you give us.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.800
We love telling these stories with you.

33:48.800 --> 33:52.720
Love, Claire, Cookie, Thunder, Brielle, and Anders,

33:52.720 --> 33:54.080
the Knights of the Armored Pig.

33:55.200 --> 33:58.400
I think this isn't real.

33:58.400 --> 34:00.240
I think this is like a fiction.

34:00.240 --> 34:04.240
I think it's like a fantastical world sort of like, yeah.

34:04.240 --> 34:05.760
I think somebody's like using our podcast

34:05.760 --> 34:09.680
like send a message like an alt reality ARG fantastical world.

34:09.680 --> 34:11.040
So they're not really knights?

34:12.080 --> 34:13.200
They might be, they might be.

34:13.200 --> 34:14.320
That part might be real.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.960
But this person being a big spider, I mean.

34:16.960 --> 34:18.640
Uh-huh.

34:18.640 --> 34:21.040
How would they even drive a car?

34:21.040 --> 34:22.080
I guess at that point.

34:22.080 --> 34:27.040
Well, if you designed the car specifically for a spider.

34:27.040 --> 34:29.040
Sure, I mean, four brake pedals, four gas pedals.

34:29.040 --> 34:30.800
There's no denying that, Trav.

34:30.800 --> 34:36.320
This next message is for Sam Boat, a.k.a. Heely Boy.

34:36.320 --> 34:38.880
I think you just did a.k.a. a.k.a.

34:38.880 --> 34:39.600
I think I did.

34:39.600 --> 34:40.640
A.k.a. a.k.a.

34:40.640 --> 34:42.080
It got away from me because I got distracted.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.520
A.k.a. a.k.a.

34:43.520 --> 34:45.360
A.k.a. a.k.a.

34:45.360 --> 34:49.520
And it's from Ray Ray, a.k.a. The Shut In Roommate.

34:51.360 --> 34:54.160
Maybe that's like Ray Ray's wrestling.

34:54.160 --> 34:56.160
Like, oh, it's the Shut In Roommate.

34:57.440 --> 34:59.840
Okay, thank you for being the best friend

34:59.840 --> 35:03.680
and fellow Mackle fan this garbage boy could ask for.

35:03.680 --> 35:07.040
It freaks my bean how positive you are 24 seven.

35:07.680 --> 35:11.040
And it's helped me survive some of the toughest times of my life.

35:11.040 --> 35:13.600
We won't be roomies anymore after this year,

35:13.600 --> 35:16.640
but you'll always be my fourth brother from another mother.

35:16.640 --> 35:18.720
My Lin-Manuel, you might say.

35:18.720 --> 35:19.600
Happy birthday.

35:20.640 --> 35:23.600
Wanted this one April 21st, so we fucked that up.

35:23.600 --> 35:25.600
Hopefully you're still a Mackle fan, as you said.

35:26.480 --> 35:28.000
Got a message for Josh.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.600
One last Jumbotron here.

35:29.600 --> 35:30.880
It's from Jeremy.

35:30.880 --> 35:34.560
It says, hey, sorry I was such a shitty middlest brother

35:34.560 --> 35:35.440
while we were kids.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.640
You were and are an awesome sweet baby brother.

35:38.640 --> 35:41.040
Good job putting that master's degree in math to work

35:41.040 --> 35:42.400
with that teaching gig.

35:42.400 --> 35:44.880
P.S. Thanks for coming all the way to Canterbury

35:44.880 --> 35:46.320
just to play in my D&D game.

35:46.880 --> 35:48.080
Well, that's very nice.

35:48.080 --> 35:51.200
Sounds like you all have a lovely relationship

35:51.200 --> 35:52.240
that's evolved over the years.

35:52.800 --> 35:54.240
And it's good to hear.

35:54.240 --> 35:54.640
Good to see.

35:54.640 --> 35:55.200
Jealous.

35:55.200 --> 35:55.760
Jealous.

35:55.760 --> 35:56.400
Nice.

35:56.400 --> 35:57.440
Wait, why stagnant?

35:58.160 --> 35:59.360
Griffin, what do you mean jealous?

35:59.360 --> 36:02.400
Well, we're not allowed to evolve since we started the show.

36:02.400 --> 36:05.120
So like our relationship has to stay the same.

36:05.120 --> 36:06.800
We're all kind of Rosses now.

36:06.800 --> 36:07.840
We're all the Ross.

36:07.840 --> 36:09.840
Now we are all become Ross.

36:09.840 --> 36:13.120
I have a friend who like meets up with his family every year

36:13.120 --> 36:15.920
and all they do is just like sit around in nature

36:15.920 --> 36:19.280
and, you know, talk for hours and learn and grow.

36:19.280 --> 36:21.440
And it's like, that would ruin this whole thing.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.280
We can't have a conversation and we don't record.

36:24.080 --> 36:24.800
That's all that.

36:24.800 --> 36:25.360
I'll just leave it at that.

36:25.360 --> 36:26.000
We can't finish.

36:26.000 --> 36:26.400
Imagine.

36:27.280 --> 36:27.520
Okay.

36:28.480 --> 36:30.720
It's the saying of things like we can't finish.

36:30.720 --> 36:33.760
That is like the proof is in the gross pudding.

36:33.760 --> 36:36.240
Some people wouldn't even say that to their brothers.

36:36.240 --> 36:37.200
Yeah, can you imagine?

36:37.200 --> 36:37.760
Can you imagine?

36:40.160 --> 36:41.920
Hi there, I'm film critic April Wolf

36:41.920 --> 36:45.360
and host of the maximum fun podcast Switchblade Sisters.

36:45.360 --> 36:47.040
Do you love genre films?

36:47.040 --> 36:48.800
Do you love female filmmakers?

36:48.800 --> 36:50.480
Do you love discussions on craft?

36:50.480 --> 36:53.440
If your answer is yes, you'll love Switchblade Sisters.

36:53.440 --> 36:56.080
Every episode I invite one female filmmaker on

36:56.080 --> 36:58.800
and we talk in depth about their fave genre film

36:58.800 --> 37:00.480
and how it influenced their own work.

37:00.480 --> 37:05.840
So we're talking horror, action, sci-fi, fantasy, bizarro and exploitation cinema.

37:05.840 --> 37:07.520
Mothers, lock up your sons

37:07.520 --> 37:10.160
because the Switchblade Sisters are coming for you.

37:10.160 --> 37:14.080
Available at maximumfun.org or wherever you find your podcasts.

37:18.080 --> 37:18.400
All right.

37:18.400 --> 37:19.520
Continue what you're saying.

37:20.640 --> 37:21.680
I forget what I was fucking saying.

37:23.280 --> 37:23.680
All right.

37:23.680 --> 37:25.760
It's no fun if I don't get to interrupt something.

37:25.760 --> 37:27.440
Well, then you have to let us start.

37:27.440 --> 37:28.160
Okay, I'm sorry.

37:28.160 --> 37:28.480
Okay.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.880
Hey, let's wait for a few more.

37:31.600 --> 37:33.040
I'll bring it back in in a few minutes.

37:33.040 --> 37:35.120
Let's do a question first.

37:35.120 --> 37:36.240
Go ahead, Griff.

37:36.240 --> 37:37.440
Okay, here comes a Yahoo!

37:37.440 --> 37:39.040
That was eat my shit, Justin.

37:39.040 --> 37:40.400
Eat the shit out of my butt.

37:40.400 --> 37:40.640
Yeah.

37:40.640 --> 37:40.960
Okay.

37:43.360 --> 37:44.560
Yeah, a little bit of shit.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.640
Oh, shit, that sounds bad.

37:52.320 --> 37:53.040
It's getting tender.

37:53.680 --> 37:54.560
It's getting gentle.

37:54.560 --> 37:57.120
This is the extreme more than words version of...

37:57.120 --> 38:02.480
Oh, now it's getting kind of patriotic.

38:05.440 --> 38:06.240
This is the Munch Squad.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.480
I want a Munch Squad.

38:12.240 --> 38:15.280
I want too much squad.

38:15.280 --> 38:18.640
That was the first rap break that we've had in the middle of the Munch Squad intro.

38:19.920 --> 38:20.240
Yeah.

38:21.840 --> 38:22.560
So right.

38:22.560 --> 38:25.280
So, oh, man, this one's good.

38:25.280 --> 38:26.000
Chick-fil-A.

38:26.000 --> 38:30.880
Who I don't know has actually made it to...

38:30.880 --> 38:33.040
Thank you to Adam, by the way, for sending this my way.

38:33.040 --> 38:36.160
I don't know that Chick-fil-A has made it to the squad before.

38:36.160 --> 38:38.640
Well, they mostly do sort of straightforward God food.

38:38.640 --> 38:42.320
It's mainly God's food and six days a week.

38:42.320 --> 38:45.840
I normally go check out all the local restaurants to find my Munch Squad source

38:45.840 --> 38:48.960
material on Sundays and they are always closed.

38:49.680 --> 38:50.880
So that is an issue.

38:51.600 --> 38:53.440
Because they're so lazy.

38:53.440 --> 39:00.240
Chick-fil-A is testing meal kits at 150 restaurants.

39:01.680 --> 39:02.400
Okay.

39:02.400 --> 39:02.800
Okay.

39:02.800 --> 39:04.400
So here's what I'm saying to you.

39:05.120 --> 39:05.440
Yeah.

39:06.160 --> 39:07.440
Here's what I'm saying to you.

39:07.440 --> 39:09.120
This is going to happen in the Atlanta...

39:09.120 --> 39:10.560
Oh, dudes.

39:10.560 --> 39:13.520
It's starting August 27th across the Atlanta area.

39:14.720 --> 39:15.120
Oh, shit.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.400
We will be there for it.

39:17.040 --> 39:18.720
It's a totally new concept for the brand.

39:18.720 --> 39:21.360
And yeah, we will be right there.

39:21.360 --> 39:26.800
They're launching them at 150 restaurants, which are designed for customers.

39:26.800 --> 39:27.040
Okay.

39:29.600 --> 39:33.280
They're designed for customers to cook their own meals at home with pre-measured ingredients

39:33.280 --> 39:39.440
available for pickup in the drive-through at the front counter or via the Chick-fil-A 1 app.

39:40.080 --> 39:41.120
What are we doing?

39:41.120 --> 39:42.080
What I'm saying to you...

39:42.080 --> 39:43.600
Are you fucking with me?

39:43.600 --> 39:52.480
What I'm saying to you is you buy the ingredients at Chick-fil-A, you say,

39:52.480 --> 39:54.480
honey, let's stay in tonight at Cook.

39:55.120 --> 39:58.720
And your husband says, okay, honey, I'd love that.

39:59.360 --> 40:00.880
Let's go to Chick-fil-A.

40:00.880 --> 40:02.800
And you said, no, you dumb shit.

40:02.800 --> 40:04.880
I said, let's stay home and cook.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.400
No, I heard you.

40:06.400 --> 40:11.360
I'm going to cut out all the shopping and just get the ingredients at Chick-fil-A.

40:11.360 --> 40:16.000
I'm going to cut out both the options and convenience.

40:16.000 --> 40:16.320
Yes.

40:16.320 --> 40:17.840
It's the worst of both.

40:17.840 --> 40:21.840
Imagine Chick-fil-A, you have to cook on your own.

40:22.400 --> 40:24.320
Can you even fathom it?

40:24.320 --> 40:28.160
Chick-fil-A will be the first in the quick service industry to offer a full meal kit

40:28.160 --> 40:32.960
offering and customer feedback on the test will help the restaurant company decide whether

40:32.960 --> 40:34.640
to roll out the concept nationwide.

40:34.640 --> 40:36.320
So here's what that feedback looks like.

40:36.320 --> 40:37.360
Someone comes to the counter.

40:37.360 --> 40:38.560
Um, yes, sir.

40:38.560 --> 40:39.120
Yes, hello.

40:39.120 --> 40:39.680
Excuse me.

40:39.680 --> 40:43.440
I got the the meal kit from Chick-fil-A.

40:43.440 --> 40:43.760
Uh-huh.

40:43.760 --> 40:44.160
Yes, sir.

40:44.160 --> 40:45.040
What did you think?

40:45.040 --> 40:47.760
Well, it was a dumb thing of me to do.

40:47.760 --> 40:51.120
But the blame you have fulfilled your end of the bargain.

40:52.080 --> 40:53.840
I did a dumb thing.

40:53.840 --> 40:58.240
If you think about it, I felt depressed in myself and sad about my own self.

40:58.240 --> 41:00.000
And that's not really feedback on your product.

41:00.000 --> 41:00.560
There you go.

41:00.560 --> 41:04.960
I have no complaints about you, but you have made me realize something about myself that

41:04.960 --> 41:06.160
I am disappointed in.

41:06.160 --> 41:07.360
So thank you.

41:07.360 --> 41:13.520
Uh, the test that so they've got five meal kit recipes nationwide.

41:13.520 --> 41:18.240
You can express your interest in trying the kits by filling out an online form.

41:18.240 --> 41:21.440
So, um, if you do this, it should have a pop up.

41:21.440 --> 41:22.720
It's like, get a hobby.

41:22.720 --> 41:24.880
It's like, what are you?

41:24.880 --> 41:25.920
It's fucking something.

41:25.920 --> 41:29.680
This is a form that's like, bring these meal kits to my fucking place.

41:29.680 --> 41:30.400
This is amazing.

41:30.400 --> 41:32.720
I tell you the most bonkers thing.

41:32.720 --> 41:34.320
I'm looking at these five recipes.

41:34.320 --> 41:40.240
None of them are chicken sandwich or chicken nuggets or waffle fries.

41:40.240 --> 41:42.160
Yeah, but Trav, you could get that.

41:42.160 --> 41:44.560
That would be truly maddening.

41:44.560 --> 41:49.520
Like, that would be truly like, I'm going to cook high chick-fil-a.

41:49.520 --> 41:50.400
I'm going to cook.

41:50.400 --> 41:53.360
I want to out chick-fil-a, chick-fil-a at my own home.

41:54.080 --> 41:55.680
They're not going to give you the ingredients to do that.

41:55.680 --> 42:00.320
You're going to have chicken parmesan, chicken enchiladas, Dijon chicken, pan-roasted chicken

42:00.320 --> 42:02.080
and chicken flatbread.

42:02.080 --> 42:08.240
But he's making your own nugs at home really so much weirder than saying, I'm in the mood

42:08.240 --> 42:09.920
for chicken enchiladas.

42:09.920 --> 42:14.320
Going to drive over to chick-fil-a and get the individual ingredients.

42:14.320 --> 42:17.600
It's so wild.

42:17.600 --> 42:25.120
Blue Apron, I trust to give me a box of like, good ingredients that I know where they came

42:25.120 --> 42:28.720
from and they will taste good at the end of it.

42:28.720 --> 42:30.800
Chick-fil-a is chick-fil-a though.

42:30.800 --> 42:35.600
That's like, I don't know, we haven't established that level of trust, chick-fil-a.

42:35.600 --> 42:43.600
Yeah, the problem is that they can't do the chicken sandwiches because there's a lot of

42:43.600 --> 42:45.680
complex sort of things that go into making it.

42:45.680 --> 42:47.760
You have to brine the chicken in the pickle juice.

42:48.400 --> 42:53.360
The big thing is that you can't really put homophobia in a meal prep box.

42:53.360 --> 42:54.320
Do you know what I mean?

42:54.320 --> 42:58.320
Like, they have to do that kind of on site by putting it in a bag and then hanging it

42:58.320 --> 43:04.640
up in front of an old episode of Friends for like, a day and you can't really do that at

43:04.640 --> 43:05.200
home.

43:05.200 --> 43:05.840
There it is.

43:07.440 --> 43:11.680
What the fuck are we even doing as a people, as a civilization?

43:11.680 --> 43:17.680
I don't have a good answer for why chick-fil-a is doing this.

43:17.680 --> 43:20.400
It just, and also can I say one other thing?

43:20.400 --> 43:25.520
If you don't have a chick-fil-a in your area, especially one with a drive-thru, chick-fil-a

43:25.520 --> 43:30.720
drive-thrus are absolutely fucking buck wild.

43:30.720 --> 43:35.840
I have not seen the one in Huntington near the Barbersville Mall not extend out the parking

43:35.840 --> 43:38.480
lot and down the street in my entire life.

43:38.480 --> 43:42.160
It is always 15 minutes waiting in line to get this chick-fil-a.

43:42.160 --> 43:45.680
So you're going to go to the chick-fil-a, you're going to wait 15 minutes in line so

43:45.680 --> 43:48.960
you can get the ingredients to make Dijon chicken at home?

43:49.520 --> 43:50.800
Who would do this?

43:50.800 --> 43:54.720
I'm looking through the FAQs here and none of them are, why did you do this?

43:54.720 --> 43:55.600
Why did you do it?

43:56.800 --> 44:02.320
Hey chick-fil-a, I got a Q that will perhaps become FA, ASAP.

44:02.320 --> 44:03.120
Why?

44:03.120 --> 44:04.400
WHY, guys?

44:05.040 --> 44:07.280
I got a Yahoo that was sent in by Mike Eckert.

44:07.280 --> 44:07.840
Thanks, Mike.

44:07.840 --> 44:09.280
It's Yahoo Answers user.

44:09.280 --> 44:14.640
Layla asks, am I a hipster if I watch DVDs?

44:16.000 --> 44:16.800
Oh, come on.

44:18.320 --> 44:19.120
Oh, god.

44:19.760 --> 44:23.920
For movies, I buy DVDs instead of Netflix or buying it online or something.

44:23.920 --> 44:26.960
I have a huge closet filled with DVDs.

44:26.960 --> 44:29.440
I just prefer a DVD over Netflix or digital.

44:29.440 --> 44:30.880
Does that make me a hipster?

44:30.880 --> 44:36.320
You can't get the fucking quality, the fucking, the crackles, the snaps, and the pops of the

44:36.320 --> 44:46.080
film reel spooling through its mechanisms unless you get the authentic DVD of the movie swingers.

44:46.080 --> 44:54.480
You can't get the bonus, you don't get those bonus features of Jon Favreau being all Favreau

44:54.480 --> 44:58.480
like on the Netflix version, you don't get the pops of the reels.

44:59.040 --> 45:00.720
You gotta be able to feel it.

45:00.720 --> 45:02.720
I went to Alamo Drafthouse.

45:02.720 --> 45:10.480
They did a special screening of Go, the follow-up to swingers that nobody seems to remember,

45:10.480 --> 45:16.880
and they had a new print, a lost, long lost print on DVD of it.

45:16.880 --> 45:21.440
Oh, it was like I was seeing it the way that the director intended.

45:21.440 --> 45:23.920
They do load faster than Blu-rays.

45:23.920 --> 45:29.120
If you have a child in the back seat that needs to watch Trolls then and not in two

45:29.120 --> 45:31.760
minutes, the DVDs do load faster.

45:31.760 --> 45:33.680
So there is like, I don't want to be that guy.

45:34.240 --> 45:37.040
The DVDs do load faster than the Blu-rays, okay?

45:37.040 --> 45:38.160
That I will say.

45:38.160 --> 45:42.000
I love being able to display my stuff, right?

45:42.000 --> 45:46.000
So that when people come in, they can be like, oh, you have a lot of Jon Favreau movies.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.520
And I'll say, yes, I do.

45:47.520 --> 45:53.120
Because when I have them on my iTunes, people can't see them, you know?

45:53.120 --> 45:54.880
And they load faster.

45:54.880 --> 46:02.400
I just think that DVDs are a little more, it's a format of the people.

46:02.400 --> 46:09.040
Oh, you remember when DVDs first came out and everybody started making their own movies?

46:10.720 --> 46:11.360
No.

46:11.360 --> 46:12.080
Yeah, okay.

46:12.080 --> 46:12.560
No, yes.

46:14.240 --> 46:18.640
You remember when the DVDs first came out, everybody started making their own movies?

46:19.360 --> 46:20.000
Yes, yes.

46:20.000 --> 46:28.240
And that was a really kind of a democratizing format for a lot of people.

46:28.240 --> 46:29.760
Because, hold on, let me start over.

46:29.760 --> 46:33.280
You remember when VHS came out and everybody started making their own movies?

46:34.400 --> 46:40.480
Okay, well, on that format, you could put one in your dad's big VCR and you could shoot

46:40.480 --> 46:42.000
your own movie, right?

46:42.000 --> 46:43.440
Yeah, and that was the brand of it.

46:43.440 --> 46:46.080
I believe it was the Mitsubishi dad's VCR.

46:49.600 --> 46:58.960
For me, the DVD was Hollywood's way of saying, that's ours, you know what I mean?

46:58.960 --> 47:02.560
That's Hollywood's way of saying, not everybody can actually make a movie.

47:02.560 --> 47:05.920
We're taking this back, because your dad doesn't have a DVD camera.

47:05.920 --> 47:08.480
And if he does, we'll buy it, because that's amazing.

47:09.280 --> 47:11.040
Was your dad Steven Spielberg?

47:11.040 --> 47:14.400
Are you Joni Spielberg, child of Steven?

47:15.120 --> 47:15.440
Yes.

47:16.240 --> 47:17.520
With your DVD camera?

47:17.520 --> 47:18.960
That's got to cost an arm and a leg.

47:18.960 --> 47:19.460
Yeah.

47:21.280 --> 47:24.560
So, Justin, I guess I'm confused as to what your point is.

47:24.560 --> 47:27.280
Yeah, but VHS is a format of the people.

47:27.280 --> 47:27.840
This is what I'm saying.

47:27.840 --> 47:30.320
VHS is a format of the people.

47:30.320 --> 47:35.520
What I like about DVDs is it was Hollywood's way of saying, not everybody can do this.

47:37.760 --> 47:40.160
Kevin Smith, not everybody can do this, okay?

47:41.360 --> 47:44.160
You can't just decide you're going to make a movie.

47:44.160 --> 47:45.280
Give this back to us.

47:48.160 --> 47:49.120
You like that about DVDs.

47:49.120 --> 47:51.200
I like the artistic voice.

47:52.400 --> 47:53.760
The ship has been righted.

47:53.760 --> 47:58.240
And the auteurs, the auteurs can take the format back.

47:58.240 --> 48:01.440
They take movies back from the common man, and they say,

48:01.440 --> 48:05.120
actually, this isn't, like, not everybody can make movies.

48:05.680 --> 48:08.000
Like, you can't do that anymore.

48:08.000 --> 48:08.640
That's ours again.

48:08.640 --> 48:09.520
Yeah, it's ours.

48:09.520 --> 48:10.000
It's ours again.

48:10.000 --> 48:18.160
Okay, so, Justin, what you like about DVDs is how restrictive and exclusive it is.

48:18.160 --> 48:22.880
If I bought a VHS, fucking anybody could have made it.

48:22.880 --> 48:28.880
If I get a movie on VHS, like, anybody, anybody could have made that film.

48:29.600 --> 48:33.280
If I get a movie on DVD, I know that Hollywood...

48:34.080 --> 48:35.120
Hollywood made it.

48:35.120 --> 48:36.880
It's got the Hollywood feel to it.

48:36.880 --> 48:42.000
It's got that special bit of Hollywood glamour, that little bit of glitter sprinkled over it.

48:44.480 --> 48:46.480
Travis, you're very confused, I can tell.

48:46.480 --> 48:48.960
I want to help you walk you through, Justin.

48:48.960 --> 48:50.880
Okay, please, yes.

48:50.880 --> 48:52.320
You can't just make a DVD.

48:52.320 --> 48:52.720
Thank you.

48:54.000 --> 48:54.800
Thank you, yes.

48:55.920 --> 48:57.040
I can't just make a DVD.

48:57.040 --> 48:59.920
I can't go out there with my friends and shoot a DVD movie.

48:59.920 --> 49:00.800
Do you understand now?

49:03.280 --> 49:06.000
It's the disc, and nobody knows how to put the thing on the disc.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.800
And so, but that makes it better.

49:09.680 --> 49:10.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:10.160 --> 49:11.680
It's better because you can trust...

49:11.680 --> 49:13.760
It ups the level of quality.

49:13.760 --> 49:14.080
Okay.

49:14.080 --> 49:17.680
Because you know Hollywood has had their fingers all over it if you see a DVD.

49:18.320 --> 49:19.040
Oh, okay.

49:19.040 --> 49:25.440
If I went out to the store, the movie store, and I bought Lost in Space with Matt LeBlanc in it,

49:25.440 --> 49:27.680
on VHS, anybody could have made that.

49:27.680 --> 49:31.040
Anybody could have made that to VHS, like Dad's Big VCR would play.

49:31.040 --> 49:32.480
Matt LeBlanc could have made it?

49:32.480 --> 49:33.920
Matt LeBlanc could have made it, yeah.

49:33.920 --> 49:40.160
And if I go to the DVD store for movies, and I get the DVD of Lost in Space,

49:40.160 --> 49:41.760
it's just going to be the genuine article.

49:41.760 --> 49:44.240
It's going to be the real Lost in Space, and there's no doubt about that.

49:44.240 --> 49:46.320
That was the first DVD I ever bought, by the way.

49:46.320 --> 49:46.800
Was it?

49:46.800 --> 49:47.840
Good pickup, good pickup.

49:47.840 --> 49:49.840
Good soundtrack on that one too.

49:49.840 --> 49:52.080
Second one, oh yeah, fucking Apollo 440 crushed it.

49:52.080 --> 49:59.120
And then the second one I bought was The Time Machine starring fucking...

49:59.120 --> 50:00.240
Guy Pearce.

50:00.240 --> 50:00.800
Guy Pearce.

50:00.800 --> 50:01.920
I had a real fucking...

50:02.880 --> 50:04.800
I had a real preference back then.

50:05.440 --> 50:09.840
And now, and this is what I'm saying with Netflix, we're back to anybody could have made it before.

50:09.840 --> 50:09.920
Thank you.

50:09.920 --> 50:11.120
Because it could just be like...

50:11.120 --> 50:16.080
I turn it on YouTube, and I search for The Time Machine.

50:16.080 --> 50:18.960
I'm going to find a bunch of like Minecraft videos,

50:18.960 --> 50:21.760
and I'm going to find a bunch of like dumb videos that might...

50:21.760 --> 50:23.440
Gameplay walkthrough.

50:23.440 --> 50:27.360
Gameplay walkthrough of, you know, Mario is missing, and it's like...

50:31.760 --> 50:32.960
It's not The Time Machine.

50:35.280 --> 50:38.240
If you search YouTube for The Time Machine,

50:38.240 --> 50:42.960
the first result is a single button that you click to watch the actual movie.

50:42.960 --> 50:46.080
The Time Machine starring Guy Pearce.

50:46.080 --> 50:48.480
That is literally the first thing.

50:49.040 --> 50:54.240
And then the next four results are clips from the movie The Time Machine.

50:54.240 --> 50:58.080
The first button is like, oh, you wanted to watch The Time Machine with Guy Pearce.

50:58.080 --> 50:59.040
We got you.

50:59.040 --> 50:59.760
No problem.

51:00.640 --> 51:03.680
There's nobody stopping us from putting this entire movie up here.

51:03.680 --> 51:04.880
That's an outlier.

51:04.880 --> 51:06.560
That's an outlier.

51:06.560 --> 51:08.160
The exception proves the rule.

51:08.160 --> 51:08.960
I guess.

51:08.960 --> 51:10.560
I just want to touch the movie.

51:10.560 --> 51:13.440
When I want to watch Swingers, I want to touch Swingers.

51:13.440 --> 51:14.560
I don't want to just...

51:14.560 --> 51:15.440
It's intimate.

51:15.440 --> 51:16.400
I touch it.

51:16.400 --> 51:18.000
I put it in the machine.

51:18.000 --> 51:21.680
I, you know, real quickly put my finger in and out of the little hole

51:21.680 --> 51:24.160
just to make sure there's no dust, dirt, or cobwebs in there.

51:24.160 --> 51:24.660
Yep.

51:25.280 --> 51:28.720
And if you don't do that, you're going to get gunk all over your DVD player.

51:28.720 --> 51:29.220
Yep.

51:29.840 --> 51:34.320
And that we all still have a standalone DVD player in our house that we all still definitely use.

51:34.320 --> 51:34.720
Yes.

51:34.720 --> 51:38.160
You finger blast it, clean it out, you put it in, and then you watch the movie.

51:38.160 --> 51:40.240
And then you've had like a little bond with the movie.

51:40.240 --> 51:44.640
When I load it up on Netflix, I don't get to finger blast.

51:44.640 --> 51:45.600
Yeah.

51:45.600 --> 51:46.880
There's nothing to finger blast.

51:46.880 --> 51:48.080
Here's the thing.

51:48.080 --> 51:53.920
When it comes to your digital movies, your Netflixes, your iTunes, your what have yous,

51:54.480 --> 51:58.320
when the shit hits the fan, right, and the end times come,

51:58.320 --> 52:00.800
we won't be able to watch this anymore, right?

52:00.800 --> 52:05.360
But if I hold my DVD up to the light in the right way...

52:05.360 --> 52:07.440
Spin it around on your finger real fast.

52:07.440 --> 52:07.920
Right.

52:07.920 --> 52:12.400
Get a laser pointer and like I can play it myself.

52:12.400 --> 52:13.120
You know what I mean?

52:13.120 --> 52:18.160
And like you just don't get that with digital movies.

52:18.160 --> 52:18.640
Yeah.

52:18.640 --> 52:19.440
What do we do now?

52:20.320 --> 52:20.720
I don't know.

52:20.720 --> 52:22.480
We usually wrap up here, I think.

52:22.480 --> 52:22.960
Okay.

52:22.960 --> 52:24.880
No, I think he means as like a people.

52:24.880 --> 52:26.480
No, I did mean us.

52:26.480 --> 52:27.520
Specifically us.

52:27.520 --> 52:31.440
Thank you so much for listening to our show.

52:31.440 --> 52:33.120
We love you so much.

52:33.120 --> 52:37.760
And we appreciate all your support all the time.

52:37.760 --> 52:42.720
I wanted to mention, I am trying to get Pete and Pete season three release on DVD.

52:42.720 --> 52:48.640
So if you just tweet, set the Peets free, hashtag set the Peets free, just tweeted it,

52:48.640 --> 52:51.840
Nickelodeon, and just let them know sort of.

52:51.840 --> 52:58.000
They have acknowledged me because they sent me a GIF of little Pete sticking his tongue out.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.360
So they're kind of fucking with me.

52:59.360 --> 53:00.640
Did they send you any GIFs?

53:00.640 --> 53:02.720
No, choose your networks, choose GIFs.

53:02.720 --> 53:03.280
Okay.

53:03.280 --> 53:08.960
And so I'm very excited that the campaign is building ahead of steam.

53:08.960 --> 53:10.560
We got a theme song.

53:10.560 --> 53:14.720
We've gotten some tweets from both the Peets in support.

53:14.720 --> 53:16.880
So it's really building a lot of momentum.

53:16.880 --> 53:18.320
So hashtag set the Peets free.

53:18.320 --> 53:19.120
Let's do this thing.

53:20.160 --> 53:24.400
So couple very important announcements, along with the important announcements about

53:24.400 --> 53:25.200
set the Peets free.

53:25.200 --> 53:31.840
So PodCon, it's coming again.

53:31.840 --> 53:34.160
Do you hear the blues are calling?

53:34.160 --> 53:34.880
It's PodCon.

53:34.880 --> 53:37.200
Because it's in Seattle?

53:37.200 --> 53:37.840
What the fuck?

53:37.840 --> 53:38.400
Sure.

53:38.400 --> 53:39.360
But it's coming again.

53:39.360 --> 53:43.280
And it's January 2019.

53:43.280 --> 53:48.480
But we need your help because we are funding it and trying to make sure that we have the

53:48.480 --> 53:52.960
funds to be able to make it as good, if not better, than it was last time.

53:52.960 --> 54:00.160
If you weren't able to make it to PodCon 1.0, it's maybe my favorite convention thing I've

54:00.160 --> 54:00.880
ever been to.

54:00.880 --> 54:04.080
I made a lot of great friends there, and we did a lot of good shows, and it was super

54:04.080 --> 54:04.580
fun.

54:05.360 --> 54:08.160
And we're really excited to be able to do it again.

54:08.160 --> 54:12.080
So please consider donating to the campaign to fund PodCon.

54:12.080 --> 54:17.600
If you go to bit.ly slash McElroyPodCon2, you'll find it there.

54:17.600 --> 54:18.480
We're going to be there.

54:20.000 --> 54:20.640
Let's see.

54:20.640 --> 54:25.040
Go there and look at all the other amazing shows that we've already got on the list,

54:25.040 --> 54:28.880
and we're hoping to have even more guests and shows.

54:28.880 --> 54:30.880
But we need your help to do that.

54:32.080 --> 54:35.840
So bit.ly slash McElroyPodCon2.

54:35.840 --> 54:41.040
Also, I'm going to be at Gen Con this weekend and doing a bunch of super fun events that

54:41.040 --> 54:45.920
I'm really looking forward to, including a Munchkin live stream.

54:46.880 --> 54:49.680
I'm doing a Hello from the Magic Tavern show.

54:49.680 --> 54:58.080
And I'm also doing a panel called Open DMs, where I have me and some other GM and DM people

54:58.080 --> 55:05.040
to give advice on how to be a DM and to take questions and give you some pointers on upping

55:05.040 --> 55:05.600
your game.

55:05.600 --> 55:08.560
So if you want to get those tickets ahead of time so that you can come and hang out

55:08.560 --> 55:11.920
with us, it's at McElroyShows.com slash Tours.

55:12.720 --> 55:14.480
All the events are there.

55:14.480 --> 55:17.280
Also there are our upcoming book events.

55:17.280 --> 55:21.760
We've got some, I'm doing one in Newport, Kentucky, on August 11th.

55:21.760 --> 55:25.520
Justin and Dad are doing one in Byersville, West Virginia, on August 11th.

55:25.520 --> 55:29.680
And Dad and I are doing one in Lexington, Kentucky, on August 18th.

55:30.240 --> 55:32.480
Those are also, I believe, ticketed events.

55:32.480 --> 55:35.600
You can find those on McElroyShows.com slash Tours.

55:36.560 --> 55:43.360
And speaking of Tours, we have our Orlando and Atlanta shows coming up.

55:43.360 --> 55:47.600
So please send in questions for those.

55:47.600 --> 55:50.560
If you have been waiting for the time, this is it.

55:50.560 --> 55:56.240
Make sure to include in the subject line, you know, Orlando show or Atlanta show, and

55:56.240 --> 55:57.200
we'll see you there.

55:58.000 --> 56:01.040
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for a theme song instead of departure

56:01.040 --> 56:02.480
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

56:02.480 --> 56:04.240
It's so, so, so good.

56:04.240 --> 56:06.080
I want to thank Max Fund for having us on the network.

56:06.080 --> 56:11.120
You can go to MaxFund.org, check out a lot of great free shows there, shows like Stop

56:11.120 --> 56:17.200
Podcasting Yourself and Bubble and Switchblade Sisters and a lot more at MaxFund.org.

56:17.200 --> 56:19.040
And how about that final?

56:19.040 --> 56:24.320
Oh, wait, real quick, we mentioned it, but didn't say, so our graphic novel is out.

56:24.320 --> 56:24.880
Oh, yeah.

56:24.880 --> 56:31.360
Yeah, you can get it at TheAdventureZoneComic.com or like at Barnes and Noble or like, I think

56:31.360 --> 56:32.720
a lot of bookstores now.

56:32.720 --> 56:33.440
Yep.

56:33.440 --> 56:36.720
If you haven't gotten it yet, please consider doing so.

56:36.720 --> 56:37.200
Sure.

56:37.200 --> 56:38.080
Here's that final yahoo.

56:38.080 --> 56:39.680
It was sent in by Natalie Rueb.

56:39.680 --> 56:42.320
Thanks, Natalie, it's from Yahoo Answers user Tide.

56:42.320 --> 56:46.800
This is the first episode in maybe 300 episodes where all of the names have loaded, so I think

56:46.800 --> 56:48.640
maybe I'll probably die today.

56:48.640 --> 56:52.320
I think probably a meteor will crash in my house today or something.

56:52.320 --> 57:00.720
But Tide asks, is it true that sweat and pee are like cousins?

57:00.720 --> 57:04.480
Well, it was Justin McElroy.

57:04.480 --> 57:06.720
I'm Travis McElroy.

57:06.720 --> 57:08.240
I'm Griffin McElroy.

57:08.240 --> 57:10.560
It's been my brother, my brother, and me.

57:10.560 --> 57:11.200
Kiss your dad.

57:11.200 --> 57:12.320
Square on the lips.

57:12.320 --> 57:29.680
Hey, good girls, do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna?

57:29.680 --> 57:31.520
Maximumfun.org.

57:31.520 --> 57:32.560
Comedy and culture.

57:32.560 --> 57:33.680
Artist owned.

57:33.680 --> 57:34.720
Listener supported.

57:34.720 --> 57:39.360
You probably know that MaxFun podcasters are funny in the talking way, but did you know

57:39.360 --> 57:41.840
they also are funny in the writing way?

57:41.840 --> 57:46.480
We are very excited to announce that John Hodgman and Paula Poundstone wrote books that

57:46.480 --> 57:52.000
have been named as semifinalists for the 2018 Thurber Prize for American Humor.

57:52.000 --> 57:57.600
John Hodgman, celebrated fake internet court presider, is the host of Judge John Hodgman

57:57.600 --> 58:00.640
and was recognized for his book Vacationland.

58:00.640 --> 58:05.200
Paula Poundstone's book is called The Totally Unscientific Study of the Search for Human

58:05.200 --> 58:10.000
Happiness, and you can hear her expound on happiness and many other topics on her new

58:10.000 --> 58:13.040
podcast, Nobody Listens to Paula Poundstone.

58:13.040 --> 58:17.120
The Thurber Prize is one of the highest awards for humor writing in the United States, and

58:17.120 --> 58:22.240
we are proud to have both these authors on Maximum Fun every week.

58:22.240 --> 58:31.040
Paula Poundstone and John Hodgman, congratulations.
