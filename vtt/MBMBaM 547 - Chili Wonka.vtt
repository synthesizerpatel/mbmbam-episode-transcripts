00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Here come the McElroys, we've got jokes and bits.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
We're gonna give advice and do funny skits, laughter it is in store.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Come inside and see, it's time to start.

00:33.000 --> 00:41.000
It's my brother, my brother and me.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Travis, I don't know that I have questions.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
I had emailed them to Christina, but I can email them again.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Oh, it's just in the same, I'm sorry.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
No, that's all right, no, no, no.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
It probably didn't have ads in it, right?

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
No.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Okay.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
You can just take a little time and just say I fucked up.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Well, I fucked up.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Okay.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
And I didn't anticipate your incompetence, and that was my fault.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
No, no, no, it's not my incompetence because you did not add to that.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
No, you definitely fucked this up.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
No, I fucked up because I forgot that both of you don't know how to search in your email.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
That's fine.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
No, no, the ads aren't, you didn't put the ads in, so you did fuck up.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Oh, right, right, right, right.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
I fucked up by not spitting and feeding you the ads.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
I'm glad we decided to start doing these cold opens.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
What?

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
I feel like it lends a real air of excitement and intimacy to the program.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy, and I'm a dog.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
My name is Griffin McElroy, and I'm the youngest brother.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
I have the intro.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
That's what Travis' last words to us.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
No, no, no, can I tell you, that was a completely separate thing.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Yeah.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
I simply am a dog.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
That's consistency, Justin, and we've got to respect that.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
Okay, completely different thing.

02:03.000 --> 02:11.000
Normally, my kind of bit here goes a little bit longer, but it's because I have an important presentation for you guys,

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
and I appreciate you taking this time to hear said presentation.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Kind of out of our hands.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
I really wouldn't participate.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Hold on, Travis.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
I need to sync up into the Google Buzz meeting room that you've set up here.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Thank you.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Okay.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Well, hold on.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
I've got to download a flash update in order to see these slides.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Hold on.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Okay.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
I didn't do slides.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Was I supposed to do slides?

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
Oh, then what am I down—oh, virus.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
So here's the thing.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
I think I'll leave a space here for you guys to answer.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
What is so hot right now?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Breakfast.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Fast-food breakfasts.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Yeah.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
That's what you want in on that game.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
That's right.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Cryptocurrency.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Oh, shoot.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
And so I have been thinking that now here at the very start of the very idea of cryptocurrency,

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
that the McElroy should get in on the ground floor, and that is why I have created McElbucks.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
McElbucks?

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Yeah.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Finally.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
How much is it, Travis?

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Just give me a number.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Don't bullshit me.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
Griffin, let me tell you, that is point one of two points that separate McElbucks from

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
all of the cryptocurrency.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
One, McElbucks will always equal $1.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
So it'll be one McElbucks to $1 all the time.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
It will not change.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Okay.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
And two, it is paper currency.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
Oh, so it's just like—you could just call them bucks then.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
They are McElbucks.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Do they look different?

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
They look slightly different.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
How slight?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Because there's people—

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
I have taped our pictures onto dollar bills.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
That is noticeable enough.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
I feel like we're not going to get dinged.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
No, it's different.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Sorry, I should take that back.

03:53.000 --> 03:59.000
They're worth $1.01 because of the paper that I have taped onto there.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
So each McElbuck, if you can trade one regular dollar with a McElbuck with a friend, you

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
have made a penny, basically.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
I think you've actually lost a penny in that exchange.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Someone has.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Someone has—

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
I think we can agree on that.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
A penny has been abandoned.

04:15.000 --> 04:23.000
I'm looking at the—there's a Udemy course, $12.99, to learn how to make your own cryptocurrency

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
just like Bitcoin.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
That's what it says, actually.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
It says right here, create your own cryptocurrency just like Bitcoin.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
So is $12.99 going to be a sunk cost into this?

04:33.000 --> 04:39.000
And does that need to be amortized into the cryptocurrency, the $12.99 I'm going to need

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
to spend?

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
To say nothing of the time.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
I mean, obviously.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Are you just talking about funding McElbucks?

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
I'm saying there's a sunk cost in McElbucks of $12.99.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
I had to Xerox all the pictures of us.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
It wasn't free.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
I had to go down to Kinko's.

04:55.000 --> 05:01.000
Yeah, Trav, I'm afraid you've forgotten one important facet of cryptocurrency, and that

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
is the blockchain.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Wow.

05:03.000 --> 05:09.000
And what the blockchain is, is math puzzles that computers work on, and that gets you

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
money.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
So for this—but listen, we don't got to toss all this out.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
I'll tell you why.

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
Because I'm going to write down a math problem right now on a scrap of paper, okay?

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
And then once there's enough McElbucks out there, maybe we can solve this bad boy.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
Can I just say, this is kind of getting away from me a little bit, and I was wondering

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
if it would be okay if I just muted real quick, and I called my friend—I don't want to

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
say his name, so let's just call him Mellonusk.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Yeah.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Let me call Mellon.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Yeah, the only—

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Griffin, I'm just going to mute.

05:44.000 --> 05:50.000
I'm glad you're not calling the person whose name sounds like that, and has some hugely,

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
hugely terrible ideas about life and existence.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Fuck that guy.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
I'm calling Mellonusk.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Right.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
It's a different guy.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Hold on, hold on.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
I'm muted now.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Mellonusk is kind of—

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Yeah.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Is that—I mean—

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Hey, Jeff Bezos?

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Yeah, it's Kevin.

06:05.000 --> 06:14.000
Yeah, no, I tried the cryptocurrency thing, and—yeah, no, they—yeah, no, it was—I

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
told them I taped our faces on the dollars, and they weren't—what's that?

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
I mean, I can try.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Okay, let me try.

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
This—wait, if he's getting advice, like money advice from Bezos, this might actually

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
be good, Justin.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Unmute.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Unmute, really.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
If you don't buy into this, I'll kill you.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Okay.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Well, that's nothing.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
That's not—

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
I love the idea.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
The problem is you're not thinking big enough.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Okay.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
A million mackle bucks isn't cool.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
You know what's cool?

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Well, it's not a billion mackle bucks.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
That's not cool either.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Okay.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
There's not an amount of mackle bucks that's cool.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Well—

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
A trillion?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
That's a—

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Still not—

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Okay, no, picture it, Justin.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Yeah.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
You have a trillion mackle bucks that's not cool?

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
A trillion of anything?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
I don't think it's cool.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
That's cool.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
That's going to be a storage issue.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
At that point, where am I putting this stuff?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Oh, they're very small.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Okay.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
That wasn't clear.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Oh, yeah.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Sorry.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
So people have to get their own wallets.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
That's another—

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
I've cut dollar bills into tiny strips, and each one is a mackle buck.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Oh.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
We're hitting them in the fortune command.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Fortune commands.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
That's great, Travis.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Yeah.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
It's like confetti that was money.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
Maybe there's just one mackle buck, and that's what makes it so valuable.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
Yeah, but I don't want to have to keep track of how much it's worth at any given time.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
That seems like a lot of work for me.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
That's true.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
That's true.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
When did this show get so corporate?

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Oh, when we started doing ads, probably.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Yeah.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
This is an advice show, and what we do is we help you to build your wealth.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
That's the middle one thing.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
That's our thing.

07:45.000 --> 07:54.000
Our thing is to help you get that dream of living on the beach and just raking in the

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
winds and help you build your wealth by following our simple tips.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
Can I give a piece of advice?

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Yeah.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
If you can figure out time travel, and that's going to be a big hurdle here—

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
A big one.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Huge one.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
But go back and buy Bitcoin when everybody was like, ha, ha, Bitcoin.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
How stupid.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
That's very good.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
That's very good.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
And then sell it before everybody was like, ha, ha, Bitcoin.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
How stupid.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Again.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
So if you can figure out how to split that upright, you're rich.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
Or go into the future when Bitcoin crashes and buy it then, and bring it back to now

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
and sell it.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
That's another option.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
Or if you can know what's going to happen, you could just—I don't know if you can

08:32.000 --> 08:38.000
put out a put order on a cryptocurrency.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
It's me.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
It's me, Travis, from the future.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Macrobucks is going to be huge.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Everybody buy into Macrobucks now.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Now, wait.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Maybe this is what Jeff actually told him to do.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
Don't miss your chance buying Macrobucks now before it's too late.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
The squids.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
The squids.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Hmm.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
That's not what I expected.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
I think it's effective.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Yeah.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
Well, I mean, that's why he got to be where he is, is with that kind of lateral thinking.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
This is an advice show.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Oh, my God.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
It's an advice show.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Oh, right.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
We help people.

09:09.000 --> 09:15.000
I wish—I'd love to have one episode in the past five years where I didn't have to say

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
that line defensively.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
You know what I mean?

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Yeah.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
Almost like, Uncle, Uncle, let me up.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
That kind of vibe.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Every time I'm like, this is an advice show, I promise.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Why is this happening?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
It's advice.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
I mean, we're doing our best.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
I'm not.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Are we?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
No, I guess not.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Yeah.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
So, this is an advice show.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
I'd like to help a lot of people today.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Woo!

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
I feel like we haven't helped—yeah, I know.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
I feel like we haven't been particularly helpful lately.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
The votes are in.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
The votes are in.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
Not helpful, say the iTunes reviews.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
So, I'd like to be a little bit more helpful.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
So, I've got some questions here, and we're going to get right down to them.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
I've been talking to this girl for a little over a year.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Ooh, la, la.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
A month again.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Ooh, la, la.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
That's a long time to be talking to someone, I feel like.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Uh-oh, folks.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
It looks like we got a Romeo.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
A little over a month ago, we got into an argument that ended with, don't call me,

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
and her hanging up.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
I tried to text her a couple of times and haven't received any response.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
So, I'm assuming we're done.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
So, my problem is my drill is at her house, and I'd really like it back.

10:24.000 --> 10:30.000
How soon is too soon to call her for my drill back without her assuming I'm using it

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
as a way to reach out to her.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
That's from sick of screwing around in Charlotte.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Don't call me.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
I won't, but I do need to call you.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Ooh, but I do.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
Oh, if I could just get my Dewalt back.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
There is, you know this situation better than we do.

10:48.000 --> 10:56.000
But, like Dr. Strange, I do not see that many scenarios where this pans out good for you.

10:56.000 --> 11:03.000
In most of those scenarios, the drill is gone, and you need to be okay with that.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Yeah.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
I want to talk to you about sunk costs.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Yeah.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
I want to help you build your wealth.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
And here's how we're going to start your portfolio.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Negative one drill.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
That is the beginning of your portfolio, and let's build from there.

11:18.000 --> 11:25.000
Do you have anything of hers that you could organize a neutral party swapsies situation?

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Yeah, maybe on a long bridge.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
They send out their representative.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
You send out your representative.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
Each representative is walking halfway there and back.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Maybe it's time to upgrade.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
The universe wants you to upgrade your drill.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Mm-hmm.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
Maybe treat yourself to a nice Milwaukee or a nice Makita.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
No, Dewalt's the way to go.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Dewalt.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
What?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
You got a good Dewalt, baby.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
I'm already sunk so deep into the battery system for Milwaukee.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
I don't have a choice in cordless tool.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Well, you lost the battery too, Justin.

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
Do you think that question asker took over a batteryless drill?

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
That word was one of the worst.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Yeah.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
It got away from me.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
If you don't have two batteries, you don't own a drill.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
But now they have a battery.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Nobody says, I want to drill later.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
You know what I mean?

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Nobody's ever thought, later I hope to do some drilling.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
I better charge it.

12:19.000 --> 12:26.000
I want to drill now and then not drill for an hour while it recharges and then start drilling again.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
That is a good way to excuse yourself from a job you gave yourself though.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
It's like, oh, I was going to put together this cabinet, but who doesn't want to get some drilling done?

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
I would love to.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
I mean, sometimes you're tired.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Sometimes you have a headache.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Never too tired to drill.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
The drill's gone.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Go buy a new drill.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
I'm so sorry.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
It's expensive.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
What if it was like their grandpappy's drill?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
It's not.

12:48.000 --> 12:55.000
If it's your fucking grandpappy's drill, you need to dump that garbage because drill technology has come a long way since your grandpappy's time.

12:55.000 --> 13:02.000
This is a hand crank drill that grandpappy used to cross the plains.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
It's been in our family for 2,000 years.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
He burrowed through the plains like a mule man.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
He dug the train holes with this.

13:11.000 --> 13:16.000
That may be true, Trav, but now it is in her family for a couple weeks.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
That's just another chapter in its incredible story.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
No one saw this coming, but the drill is gone.

13:22.000 --> 13:32.000
I think for me, if that happened to me, the greatest fart in the face would be that if I had left a drill bit in there that was part of a set,

13:32.000 --> 13:38.000
I think that would be worse than anything because then it's like, am I going to buy a whole new set just to replace the quarter-inch bit?

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
Or am I going to try to find just a quarter-inch bit that matches that set and fits in the same?

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Ugh, don't even get me started.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Nightmare scenario.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Have we ostracized?

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
Do you think that was the question we ostracized the rest of our listeners with?

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
Yeah, we hit it with cryptocurrency and then business and then ostracized.

13:55.000 --> 14:03.000
I just don't know that there's a big market for people who listen to our shows who are mega into hardware.

14:03.000 --> 14:09.000
Griffin, you have no concept of the restraint that I just brought to that question.

14:09.000 --> 14:14.000
I find it so disheartening that you think that was me chatting about tools.

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
I brought a light dusting of expertise.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Justin, I'll make you a deal.

14:20.000 --> 14:26.000
You can have two minutes unfettered if I can have two minutes to talk about my new favorite show, Forged in Fire.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
No, I don't want either of them.

14:28.000 --> 14:33.000
I'm responsible, you know what I mean?

14:33.000 --> 14:41.000
To know and have the passion for tools that I do and not bring it to a show like this after 10 years of doing it.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
When I think I've earned it, you know what I mean?

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
In the words of Chris Fleming, that's grace.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
That's poise.

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
The only thing that eclipses Justin's love for tools is his love for the band Tool.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
That's the only thing greater.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
And my passion for the fabric, Tool.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
That's true.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
And cookies called Twittles.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
Yeah.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
And a pair of the letter L.

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
Yes, Tools.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Oh, God.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Oh, we just got canceled.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
We got canceled for a podcast?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Yeah, just right there.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
It came through the wire.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
This one's sent in by the wizard Ben Cant.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Thank you, Ben.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
It's Yahoo Answers.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
They're anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

15:25.000 --> 15:32.000
So I'll call him Patrick with a G at the end.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
So yeah, it's a hot new name.

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
Patrick asks, I don't like my dad's song.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
So I recently started playing guitar and I've shared the few I've learned with my parents.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
I'm in college and still live with them.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
So my dad had the idea to write lyrics and for me to play.

15:48.000 --> 15:54.000
I thought he was joking at first, but we just now spent an hour dragging through his very depressing song.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
I don't like it, but I don't want to hurt his feelings.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
What should I do?

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
I've written a new song, boy.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
I've written lyrics.

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
The song is called My Disappointing Son.

16:06.000 --> 16:16.000
There's a very well thought out, I would say heartfelt answer that is the only answer that has been left on this Yahoo Answers question.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
But the first two words of this answer, they very much sum up how I'm feeling about it.

16:20.000 --> 16:25.000
And it's just, tough one.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
It is.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
That should have been the name of this podcast.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Tough one.

16:30.000 --> 16:36.000
I think a parent's greatest wish is to be eclipsed by their child.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
Let me just say, good parents, not mine.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
That's not my thing.

16:42.000 --> 16:49.000
But I think that if you come back and take down a few notes on this song you've written and you've changed every lyric and it's better,

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
but you still make him feel like he's part of it, that's really all he's looking for.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Huge.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Huge for dads.

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
What do you think this depressing song is about?

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
It could be about anything with dads.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
You know how dads are.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
You know how dads get.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
You know how dads get.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
I have a solution to this.

17:07.000 --> 17:13.000
You say to your dad, you say, dad, I love this track and the thing is we've got to get it out live.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
We've got to get it out there.

17:15.000 --> 17:23.000
And so you go with your dad and you get him on guitar lead vocals and this part is important, you're on drums.

17:23.000 --> 17:30.000
So you get upstairs and then the announcer guy's like, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Wait, what announcer?

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Somebody's announcing your show about to start.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
That you're in your house.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Where did you do the show?

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
I just said you've got to play it out live.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Please try to keep up.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
But you said they go upstairs and it made it sound like they went up to the bedroom.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
The green room was downstairs, Travis.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
You said they go upstairs.

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
It's the second floor stage, Travis, shut up.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Why would I?

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
I didn't say they go upstairs.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
You did say they go upstairs.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
Rachel, please play back whenever I play it and we'll move forward.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
Okay.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
And this part is important.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
You're on drums.

18:10.000 --> 18:19.000
So you get upstairs and no matter what just happened there, I think what we can all agree is they're on stage.

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
And the announcer says, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage of the YMCA.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Dad and him.

18:25.000 --> 18:33.000
And then you get up and you get out your sticks and you put on your shades and you're like.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
And you're picking up the pace.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Your dad's looking back at you like, it's too fast.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
It's too fast.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
And you're like, sorry, dad, this song's a banger.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
And Steve Zahn's like, let's roll with it.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Let's roll with it.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Let's go with it.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
I love it.

18:45.000 --> 18:50.000
Snowy Sunday, thinking about the friends we lost.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
I don't know.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
This is it.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
This is the sound.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
Shut the war.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
But that is another option.

18:59.000 --> 19:06.000
Broken promises and broken dreams.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
And all the kids are like, whoa.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Yeah.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
I guess it sounds like your ex-wife really is a piece of work.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
You got me.

19:14.000 --> 19:20.000
Everybody do the ex-wife.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Everybody already has kids.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Take it from me.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Yikes.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
I'm canceled.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
We had a short career.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
Better to burn bright than to fade away.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
How about another question?

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Okay.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
I love this.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
I love this energy.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Yeah, me too.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
It's so helpful.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
I have a question here.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
You do?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Yeah.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Let's see.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
What?

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
I interrupted myself?

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
I want to munch.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Squad.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Squad.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
I want to munch.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Squad.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Squad, I'm not-

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
That wasn't- you didn't interrupt yourself, Justin.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
You possessed yourself.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Yeah.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
And also, I'm not- I don't know that I'm ready for the munch squad.

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
The munch squad is a little post ads foothold that I get while climbing-

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
We got other exciting stuff.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Jokes.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
We got exciting stuff for after.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Okay.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
So I want to get it out.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
It wouldn't feel weird though if you were like in the middle of a fancy dinner party

20:17.000 --> 20:22.000
and they said, yeah, we're going to have the main course out in a second, but first,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
here's some brandy and cigars.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
You're like, oh, not yet.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Oh, okay.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
You guys know those parties, right?

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Sure, sure, sure.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
This is a munch squad.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
It's a podcast within a podcast.

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
Only slightly munch squad related because my munch squad is not related to this, but I

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
did want to say it's wild that we didn't talk about the big game.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
I can't remember the last time a big game rolled around.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
Oh, I just assumed they canceled it because it wouldn't be safe to play sports and stuff

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
in the current pandemic.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Yeah.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
How are they doing that?

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
Because I haven't watched any football this season, but I just assumed they were zooming

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
it.

20:55.000 --> 21:02.000
Well, what it is is from six foot away, one of the defensemen will say, I tackled you

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
and the runner's like, oh man, you got me.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
Oh yeah, maybe they all have lances, like six foot lances.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Yeah.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Nerf guns.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
That's good.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Yeah.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Yeah.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
Oh, can I just say paintball football would be amazing.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
I have a few sort of juniors.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
I just want to hit y'all with it.

21:22.000 --> 21:28.000
The first is just the beginning of this story on QSR, which is one of my quick service restaurants,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
one of my sources, main sources.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
It's your fucking homepage.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
It's basically my homepage.

21:34.000 --> 21:39.000
The headline is how Wendy's got people talking about breakfast in a pandemic.

21:39.000 --> 21:45.000
Subhead, one of the biggest launches of 2020 was derailed by COVID-19 or was it?

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
I don't know, dude.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
You're writing the story.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
I'm not going to do your work for you.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
And I did want to say that handsome ass Carl Laredo is in this one.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
Everybody knows Carl Laredo, the CMO of Wendy's.

21:59.000 --> 22:10.000
It's a breakfast he said was a competitive landscape that Carl Laredo in classic Carl Laredo style referred to as the world of frozen arches.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
Oh, boy.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
It says here it's a not so veiled reference to McDonald's.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
Just say fucking McDonald's Carl at that point.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
Carl doesn't, then it wouldn't be a Laredo own.

22:20.000 --> 22:26.000
It would just be a regular burn if he didn't have a little spin on it, a little poetic license.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
You know how Carl is.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
So they're wild out there.

22:29.000 --> 22:34.000
Taco Bell's got a new five dollar build your own cravings box for the people.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
Okay.

22:35.000 --> 22:44.000
You take a boring burger bundle, you add a celebrity in the mix, you put it online and you've got the perfect recipe for, well, eating someone else's favorite.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
Taco Bell wonders, why not just eat like you?

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
A lot of people watching the fucking throne right now, huh?

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
A lot of people making a run at the king.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
So wait, wait, wait.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Not the king. That's confusing.

22:57.000 --> 23:04.000
Is the statement here the accusation of like, you don't want to eat some famous person's favorite meal.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
You want to eat yours.

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
And only with our help will you be able to do that.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
That's exactly right.

23:12.000 --> 23:24.000
You're going to be able to, rewarding their most passionate fans first, the new build your own cravings box will be exclusively available exclusively to Taco Bell rewards beta members on the Taco Bell app.

23:24.000 --> 23:30.000
As a beta member myself, I have to say this is fair and they got me.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
Stretching customers dollars further than ever before.

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
The build your own cravings box is the ultimate Taco Bell eating experience.

23:37.000 --> 23:42.000
So basically you tell them what you want to put in this big box of garbage and they're going to serve it up to you.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Right. No problem.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
And no questions asked.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
No judgment.

23:45.000 --> 23:57.000
Nikki Lawson, who sort of like the Carl Laredo of Taco Bell, says in honestly, one of the most inscrutable quotes that we've had in this segment and that is saying something.

23:57.000 --> 24:02.000
As we see it, there aren't a lot of choices out there when it comes to value.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
Forcing customers to play by others rules.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
Yeah.

24:06.000 --> 24:12.000
But when your fans have different favorites on the menu, why not celebrate that?

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Oh God, I feel free for the first time.

24:14.000 --> 24:20.000
The Taco Bell I'm proud to lead does it differently.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
The Taco Bell I'm proud to lead does it differently.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
This is my Taco Bell.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
This is my Bell.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
Taco Bell I'm proud to lead does it differently.

24:28.000 --> 24:34.000
We put fans in the driver's seat and allow them to eat how they want to eat.

24:34.000 --> 24:41.000
Not how someone, irrespective of how famous they may be, tells them to.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
Can I just say that that's a horrible kind of phrase to use?

24:44.000 --> 24:51.000
Because if I went to a NASCAR race and they put fans in the driver's seat, horrible things are going to happen.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
It's going to be a bloody massacre.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
I want experienced eating professionals in the driver's seat.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Thank you very much.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Like your Travis Scotts, I think.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Travis Scott did the McDonald's meal.

25:03.000 --> 25:10.000
What's wild about that quote is that it's not rules.

25:10.000 --> 25:21.000
Travis Scott wasn't like, you got this new McDonald's meal and it's all about me and it's a weird burger and a flurry and a lot of fucking fries.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
And just a massive, unconscionable amount of Sprite.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
And that's the, those are the fucking rules.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
That's it now.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
And it's the only thing they sell.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
Taco Bell is, this is a great part.

25:35.000 --> 25:54.000
They've got a digital and social campaign for this initiative that includes some of Taco Bell's most influential fans, including actor Noah Centineo, TikTok influencer Nova Rose, K-pop star CL, iconic drag queen Onyx Black and BMXer Brad Sims.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
I wonder if all of them agreed on BMXer way back in the day.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
I can't imagine.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
But the celebrities aren't going to be sharing their own order.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Oh, okay.

26:02.000 --> 26:07.000
They're going to be reminding consumers to never settle for someone else's taste buds.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
Then I'm going to make my own fucking tacos at home.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
This is the weird thing.

26:12.000 --> 26:21.000
Don't listen to the celebrities when they tell you what to eat at Taco Bell, but do listen to the celebrities when they tell you to eat at Taco Bell.

26:21.000 --> 26:26.000
Noah Centineo will walk you right up to the door and you'll turn around and thank him and he's gone.

26:26.000 --> 26:32.000
You can do a passionate TikTok duet with Noah Centineo, by the way, which I plan on doing right away.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
How many items do I get to put in this box?

26:36.000 --> 26:41.000
Is it like you get four items to put in the box or is it however much ground beef you can stuff?

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
It's anything they have.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Whatever can fit in the box.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
It's like a yogurt place.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
It's by weight.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
You can get a box full of loose hot sauce and that's it.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
And it still is $5.

26:53.000 --> 27:02.000
You could ask for the employees to put their wallets in the box and they have to do it because there are no fucking rules.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
You choose from one of like four different categories, basically.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Sounds like a rule to me.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
Which is like a signature item, like the Chalupa Supreme rules.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
And then they have the charmingly named starters.

27:14.000 --> 27:19.000
And one of those starters is a beefy five-layer burrito.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
I'm just feeling a bit peckish.

27:23.000 --> 27:29.000
I think I'll just have a fucking beefy five-layer burrito for the table, please.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
I couldn't possibly eat six layers.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
I'll take the five-layer one, please.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Just five layers to begin.

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
I do want to do that TikTok.

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
Look for that on my TikTok, my duet with Noah Centineo.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Griffin, when are you going to get on that TikTok?

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
As soon as somebody tells me how it works.

27:48.000 --> 27:56.000
Real quick, before we head into the break real quickly, I did want to let everybody know that this is just kind of a public service announcement.

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
The Shamrock Shake coming back February 15th.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
Just in time for Valentine's Day.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
I hear you saying I don't give a shit.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Well, that's not what McDonald's thinks.

28:07.000 --> 28:13.000
They're welcoming back not only the Shamrock Shake, but also the fan favorite Oreo Shamrock McFlurry.

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
I always like when restaurants call something a fan favorite.

28:17.000 --> 28:22.000
Because the alternative is they're bringing back something that no one seemed to enjoy, but it was cheap.

28:22.000 --> 28:26.000
We're bringing back real underdog, the Shamrock Shake.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
We're giving you one more chance to enjoy spicy chicken nuggets.

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
We think that this is an acquired taste, and one more time, please give it a try.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
We ordered so many of them.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Please.

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
If you learn to read between the lines in these things, they're actually pretty sinister.

28:42.000 --> 28:50.000
The Shamrock Shake features creamy vanilla soft serve blended with our unmistakable Shamrock Shake flavor,

28:50.000 --> 28:55.000
and finished with a whipped topping for a minty treat.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Now, there's a lot of things that they said there.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
There's a lot of things they didn't say as well as like, what is in this?

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Like, why is it like this?

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
It's minty.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
It's not mint though, is it?

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
They explained the burning that you feel when you eat it.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
Because you can justify that.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
That must be that they mentioned.

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
But everything else is a puzzle box.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
I know Chef Mike would not do a sturdy like that.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
Oh, no.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
No, no, no.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
But I have allergies, you know?

29:26.000 --> 29:30.000
For more than 50 years.

29:30.000 --> 29:35.000
It strains cajolity at this point, some of these quotes from the marketing people.

29:35.000 --> 29:40.000
This cat, Chad Schafer, is the director of culinary.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Senior director of culinary.

29:43.000 --> 29:48.000
For more than 50 years, fans have eagerly awaited the annual return of the Shamrock Shake,

29:48.000 --> 29:56.000
counting on the arrival of Shamrock Shake season to mark the unofficial start to spring.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Huh.

29:57.000 --> 30:09.000
And we heard they especially enjoyed getting a taste of the one and only Shamrock flavor in a new way last year with the Oreo Shamrock McFlurry.

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
We know this winter may feel longer than others.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
So we had to do it, had to get it in there.

30:16.000 --> 30:25.000
So we're thrilled to give customers something to look forward to by bringing both fan favorites back to the menu this month.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
So hang in there.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
The Shamrock Shake is coming.

30:30.000 --> 30:36.000
I cannot wait for, like, the first hint of, like, now everything's, like, on the upswing.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
51% of the population is vaccinated.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
You know, we're seeing daylight.

30:41.000 --> 30:48.000
Because at this point, I feel like quick service restaurants have run out of euphemisms for saying, like, I don't fucking know, man.

30:48.000 --> 30:53.000
Give them some new material about hope on the horizon and just watch them fly.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
I cannot fucking wait.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
We're going to sup on that forever.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
You know, it's funny.

30:58.000 --> 31:08.000
You always see these announcements for, like, ding, ding, ding, ding, dinner bells on, dipshits, your favorite green shake is back in stock.

31:08.000 --> 31:14.000
They never have a press release that's, like, funeral for a friend, saying goodbye once again.

31:14.000 --> 31:20.000
We know you've all looked forward to it and fucking clung to it to get through these cold winter months.

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
But, oh, well, it's March 18th, so this shit's going right in the dumpster.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
Come give it a lick if you want, if you miss it, assholes.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
It's gone.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Anyway, that's the Munch Squad.

31:30.000 --> 31:56.000
Let's take a break for some more positive commercialism in a segment we like to refer to as the Money Zone.

31:56.000 --> 32:03.000
You know, when I was a young man, I was told quite often that I was something of an upstart.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Upstart, they would say to me.

32:05.000 --> 32:09.000
You whippersnapper, they would say.

32:09.000 --> 32:13.000
But now upstarts are having their day, aren't they?

32:13.000 --> 32:20.000
Because if you have multiple credit cards, you know that tracking multiple balances, due dates, and website logins can be stressful.

32:20.000 --> 32:25.000
Upstart makes things simple with one monthly payment in one place.

32:25.000 --> 32:30.000
Unlike the premise of this video, it's simple and easy to understand.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
I am not British. I'm just old.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
You don't turn British when you get old.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
I'm an old-timey man.

32:38.000 --> 32:44.000
I'm from a time before when we lost our British accents here in America.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
I'm so old that I still have my-

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
Vestigial British accent.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
I have a vestigial British accent.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
And a lot of credit cards.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Yeah, no, that's for sure.

32:55.000 --> 33:04.000
When I was a whippersnapper, I signed up for a lot of credit cards to get the free things that they offered at baseball games.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Right, and how old are you?

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
I am 175.

33:08.000 --> 33:14.000

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Brooklinen sells very soft.

33:52.000 --> 33:56.000
When I was a young man, people used to call me Brooklinen.

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
Brooklinen, they'd say, get off my bed.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Now he's rolling his fucking R's, dude.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Get off my bed, Brooklinen.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
They'd say, ah, ah, bean.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
They'd say, get off me bed, Brooklinen.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
And I'd say, this is my bed.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
And they'd say, no, it is my bed.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
And then we'd fight in the street with pistols.

34:14.000 --> 34:20.000
Yeah, but we don't do that anymore, we just chill in our beds with our comfy sheets and stuff that Brooklinen provides us.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
Because they got the really good stuff.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Yeah, they do.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
I sleep on Brooklinen's sheets, and I sleep like an absolute baby.

34:28.000 --> 34:36.000
And whenever I used to travel, I didn't sleep in Brooklinen's sheets, and that made me sad.

34:36.000 --> 34:42.000
Sorry, I just realized that I've slept in my own bed every day for the last year, and it got me good.

34:42.000 --> 34:47.000
But they got a bunch of different colors and patterns and materials to fit your needs and your tastes.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
And they got comforters, pillows, and towels.

34:49.000 --> 34:54.000
And if you want to just feel like you have a sheet on you all fucking day, they got loungewear.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
So that's great.

34:56.000 --> 35:02.000

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
No problem.

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
These are real podcast listeners, not actors.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
What do you look for in a podcast?

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Reliability is big for me.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
Power.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
I'd say comfort.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
What do you think of this?

35:33.000 --> 35:37.000
Oh.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
That's Jordan, Jesse, go.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Jordan, Jesse, go?

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
They came out of the floor?

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
And down from the ceiling?

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
That can't be safe.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
I'm upset.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
Can we go now?

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
Soon.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Jordan, Jesse, go.

35:51.000 --> 35:59.000
A real podcast.

35:59.000 --> 36:04.000
Another question that I would like to shoot your way.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
This summer I moved into a new home.

36:06.000 --> 36:12.000
Everything was good apart from each Friday when a loud ice cream van would park right

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
outside my house at 8 p.m. and serve customers till late.

36:15.000 --> 36:20.000
However, it is now well into December and the van still shows up each week.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
I mean, we're really getting to this question pretty late, huh?

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
Yeah.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
What are you going to do?

36:25.000 --> 36:29.000
Well, we're well out of December and music well after dark.

36:29.000 --> 36:34.000
No one is buying ice cream at night in winter, and at this point I'm too nervous to go out

36:34.000 --> 36:39.000
and talk to the owner in case this is some front-flat illegal activity.

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
How should I discover what they're up to and do I even want to know?

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
That's from John in Norwich, UK.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
I've got no idea.

36:48.000 --> 36:53.000
Yeah, I don't see us being capable of answering this, but I have very good news.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
Yeah.

36:54.000 --> 37:00.000
My friend, Christina Ariel, who I recently did some game streaming with, she was telling

37:00.000 --> 37:05.000
me that there is an ice cream truck outside of her house all the time, so I think we should

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
call her and get her opinion on this.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Let me ring her up on the phone real quick.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
So many numbers.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
You don't have to hit that many numbers.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
Brrring.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
Brrring.

37:18.000 --> 37:22.000
Are we hearing the bells of Christina's phone through the phone?

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
Oh, I put a microphone in Christina's house so we could record her side of it.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
Yeah.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
Hello.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
Oh, thank God.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
Hi, Christina.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
It's Travis.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Travis McElroy.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Who?

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
Travis McElroy.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Who?

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
Travis McElroy.

37:36.000 --> 37:40.000
We did that game stream to get her where we played.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
We played that post-apocalyptic game.

37:42.000 --> 37:47.000
You probably stream with a lot of people, though, so if you don't remember him, let's

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
just clean slate it right now.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
Dad, Travis McElroy, hi.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
Hi.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
There's another Travis.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
That's not important.

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
We had a question here, and I'm going to repeat it.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
Blah, blah, blah.

37:59.000 --> 38:03.000
So now we want to get your opinion on this, because I know that there's an ice cream truck

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
that seemingly lives outside your house.

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
So what's going on here, do you think?

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
Well, I think if you want to know if this truck is actually up to something, I actually

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
have the perfect plan for you.

38:15.000 --> 38:19.000
And this works in any case if you suspect that an ice cream truck in your neighborhood

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
is maybe not just selling ice cream.

38:22.000 --> 38:27.000
Go and order a Sonic the Hedgehog ice cream with bubblegum eyes or a Ninja Turtle ice

38:27.000 --> 38:35.000
cream, and how much frost is on top of it to determine if this truck actually sells

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
ice cream.

38:36.000 --> 38:40.000
So what you're suggesting, Christina, is that they have a freezer, and inside that freezer

38:40.000 --> 38:45.000
is one Sonic the Hedgehog popsicle with gumball eyes and one Ninja Turtle popsicle with gumball

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
eyes and nothing else.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
There might be an ice cream sandwich or a bomb paw.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
One of each item.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Yes, there's one of each, and you've got to be careful.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Yes, it's an ah.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Yes, an ah ice cream pop.

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
You've got to be careful because one of them is also going to be the code word for the

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
drugs that you are also selling today.

39:04.000 --> 39:09.000
So if you are going down the list of menu items and it says like, an It's a Caduzzi

39:09.000 --> 39:16.000
is $400, then you can assume that that is some sort of slang for a drug of some sort.

39:16.000 --> 39:21.000
I bet it's pretty frustrating if you have an ice cream truck that's a front for your

39:21.000 --> 39:25.000
drug selling business, but nobody knows it's a front for a drug selling business.

39:25.000 --> 39:29.000
They just keep buying ice cream, and you're like, oh man, nobody bought drugs for me today.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
I need to work on my branding.

39:31.000 --> 39:38.000
Well, I mean, it's an interesting occupation, but it's an entrepreneurial intent.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
I don't know what it is.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
It's funny, though.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Do you know, this happens in New York City.

39:43.000 --> 39:47.000
There are trucks that drive around, and they have like pot leaves all over them and stuff,

39:47.000 --> 39:54.000
and the candy will be called like, Hemp and Honey or whatever, but like, there's no actual

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
marijuana in any of it.

39:57.000 --> 40:06.000
It's just implied, but it would be completely illegal if it was actual THC in these things,

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
but it just looks like it, and so tourists are like, oh my God, big city, and then they

40:10.000 --> 40:16.000
just buy what is essentially regular candy for like $20 an ounce.

40:16.000 --> 40:24.000
So this, the impropriety, the appearance of impropriety here is a feature and not a bug, is what you're saying.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
Yes, exactly.

40:25.000 --> 40:31.000
And you know that if you go to this ice cream vendor who is selling in such a shady way,

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
you know that this hits a Caduzzi is going to fuck you up, fam.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
It's not a question about it.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
It is actually a Caduzzi.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
Oh boy.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
It is.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
There's no doubt about it.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
This one's a Caduzzi.

40:42.000 --> 40:48.000
Christina, how do you deal with your children constantly asking you to patronize the ice cream

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
truck that is taking root outside your home?

40:51.000 --> 40:58.000
Because that would be, I feel like, a basically constant struggle between my children and I.

40:58.000 --> 41:04.000
Well, I think the best way to interfere with that is the fact that my husband is an ice cream junkie,

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
so there's always ice cream in my house, and it's like, oh, let's go to the ice cream truck,

41:07.000 --> 41:13.000
but why would we do that when we've got Good Humor strawberry shortcake bars in the fridge?

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
We've got Oreo ice cream.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Do you want a Fat Boy?

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
Like, they do like Fat Boys with peanut butter.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
You can't do that with your hard ice cream you're going to get from the ice cream truck

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
that's been sitting in there for 14 years.

41:24.000 --> 41:30.000
Christina, my wife calls the Strawberry Good Humor bars Scooter Crunch bars,

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
and I didn't know if I should divorce her or not.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
What do you think?

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
I think that you should say, you know what, hun, you call it whatever you want to,

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
and I'll call it what I want to.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
You can be wrong, but we can continue on.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
We don't talk about it that much, to be fair, actually.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Yeah, how often does that come up, Cayman?

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
It does come up organically.

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
To each their own. To each their own.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
And also, it makes me think about, do you remember those commercials for Six Flags?

41:54.000 --> 41:58.000
And they had that old dude, and he had like a bald head, and a black tuxedo, and it's like,

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
da-da-da-da-da-da.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
You can't see me, but I'm doing like this little jig.

42:02.000 --> 42:07.000
But that's what I always think about, because there was like a 90s commercial for Good Humor,

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
and they're like, ba-da-bee, ba-boo, ba-da-ba.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
I'm the Good Humor man.

42:11.000 --> 42:17.000
Yeah, they would play that in those commercials, and I think the short part of the story is,

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
I really like Good Humor bars, man.

42:19.000 --> 42:26.000
Christina, so just to clarify, talking about an ice cream truck made you think about the Six Flags guy,

42:26.000 --> 42:30.000
which then made you think about the Good Humor guy, and not the other way around?

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
No. I'm confused.

42:33.000 --> 42:39.000
Okay, so I said we have Good Humor bars in the fridge, which then made me think about that song,

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
which then made me think about the Six Flags commercial with the guys doing the dance,

42:42.000 --> 42:46.000
which then brought me back to the Good Humor song.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Speaking of.

42:48.000 --> 43:00.000
I'm the Good Humor man. I'm the only man, man with an ice cream pan. I'm taking my ice cream across the land.

43:00.000 --> 43:04.000
Cook a cookie sandwich with a chocolate chip. How about a Sunday car that'll make you flip?

43:04.000 --> 43:11.000
I'm the Good Humor man.

43:11.000 --> 43:17.000
I wish to God I could be there when this ad exec pitched this.

43:17.000 --> 43:23.000
You know what the kids are so into right now is Scatman. I love Scatman, John.

43:23.000 --> 43:32.000
The wildest thing about that is it is a parody of Scatman, but the syllable count is so far off.

43:32.000 --> 43:39.000
They are doubling the syllables of the term Scatman. It's wild. It's hubris.

43:39.000 --> 43:43.000
It's so strange that someone heard I'm the Scatman and thought,

43:43.000 --> 43:48.000
you know what that makes me think of? Good Humor man. That's wild.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
You know what's great about it is that it was like during that area,

43:51.000 --> 43:55.000
not area, but during that era where it was like Alley Cat Strike came out as a decom.

43:55.000 --> 44:02.000
It was like a big boom and like, what are those guys called? The little like, not the tub thumping dudes,

44:02.000 --> 44:06.000
but the big band swing kind of like.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Oh, like the Ryan Seds Orchestra.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Big Band Pootoo Daddies.

44:10.000 --> 44:15.000
The Squirrel Nut Zippers. Every band had the worst names. It was the worst.

44:15.000 --> 44:21.000
It seemed like they drew their names syllable by syllable out of a hopper.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Yes, it was quite terrible.

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
Why couldn't they have a cool name? Like Stained.

44:26.000 --> 44:31.000
Or Puddle of Mud. Or Puddle of Mud.

44:31.000 --> 44:35.000
Jars of Clay. Jars of Blur.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
Creed. You can't even tell.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
You can't even take me higher with that name.

44:41.000 --> 44:46.000
I'm pretty sure most of the bands we just mentioned were undercover Christian rock bands.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Sure. It's a great genre.

44:48.000 --> 44:53.000
Yeah. Okay. Not just rock. Not just Christian. Undercover Christian rock.

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
You might listen to several of their albums before you figure out.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Gotcha. Gotcha.

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
Didn't the big like Insane Clown Posse story come out?

45:01.000 --> 45:06.000
Oh yeah. The most undercover undercover Christian rock band.

45:06.000 --> 45:10.000
You're like, the Juggalos were a Christian rock band all along.

45:10.000 --> 45:16.000
The Juggalos are like, they were a plant and a criminal organization.

45:16.000 --> 45:20.000
But they were under so long, they forgot how to live a clean life.

45:20.000 --> 45:26.000
And I'm like, did we start as a Christian band or did we just decide what's happening here, guys?

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
They got departed.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
That's it.

45:31.000 --> 45:34.000
The Juggalos got raptured.

45:34.000 --> 45:39.000
It's like the great philosopher once said, 50 told me, go ahead and switch your style up.

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
And if they hate, then let them hate and watch the money pile up.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Yeah. That was from the Bible, I think.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
That's also from the Bible.

45:46.000 --> 45:52.000
That 50 he was talking about was Jesus Christ.

45:52.000 --> 45:58.000
Sometimes they called him 50 because he took the bread and the fish and he turned it into 50 bread and fish.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
Oh, that's cool. Good job, Jesus.

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
That's not enough for everybody. There were hundreds of people there.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
Not even close, not even close. But still, it was more than one.

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
Yeah, that's true. That is true.

46:10.000 --> 46:14.000
Oh my God, Charles, this is so awkward.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
But you go ahead and ask your question and then I'll ask my different question.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
Okay.

46:18.000 --> 46:23.000
I just wanted to thank Christina for taking time out of her incredibly busy schedule

46:23.000 --> 46:27.000
hosting the Star Wars High Republic web series,

46:27.000 --> 46:33.000
the official Star Wars show discussing the Star Wars High Republic series.

46:33.000 --> 46:37.000
It must be so much more fun to do that than to record this show with us.

46:37.000 --> 46:43.000
So it means so much to us that you took the time to come on our show to talk about dumb things.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
I like talking about dumb things and I like you.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
Well, thank you.

46:47.000 --> 46:52.000
We talk about Star Wars sometimes on this show, but people weirdly don't like it.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
No, no, no, no.

46:54.000 --> 47:00.000
We think Star Wars is cool. Spaceships and laser blades and all that shit is radical.

47:00.000 --> 47:07.000
But I guess we got a lot of just jocks, just a lot of jocks listening to our show.

47:07.000 --> 47:11.000
You know what you could talk about though and just change all the discourse

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
because it's one thing that everyone can agree on?

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
What's that?

47:14.000 --> 47:21.000
Ivan Ooze is one of the greatest villains in all of cinema and he deserves his flowers.

47:21.000 --> 47:30.000
The courage, the bravery required to come on our show and be a proponent of Ivan Ooze.

47:30.000 --> 47:35.000
It took my breath away, Christina.

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
It's the audacity of hope, that's what that is.

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
Some people say he's a bit much.

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
I prefer Zed, I prefer Goldar, but no.

47:45.000 --> 47:54.000
The best part of this entire movie, think of all the things I've missed, the Brady Bunch reunion.

47:54.000 --> 47:57.000
Are you kidding me? That is awesome.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
I'm sorry, I have a lot of feelings about this.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Who do you think is a more iconic movie villain?

48:01.000 --> 48:08.000
Ivan Ooze or Raul Julia as M. Bison in the Street Fighter movies?

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
Oh man, don't make me choose.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Oh, why would you do that?

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Don't make me choose.

48:13.000 --> 48:19.000
I think the reason it popped into my head is I think they're both playing at the same level.

48:19.000 --> 48:24.000
Just acting choice-wise, the same incredible level.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
It's high camp.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
Yeah, oh yeah.

48:26.000 --> 48:34.000
It is high camp and it is a fine art and I think they are both incredible artists when it comes to the camp.

48:34.000 --> 48:41.000
And I'd refuse to make a choice on this, but I will continue to say Ivan Ooze as a villain had bars.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
That's fair.

48:42.000 --> 48:50.000
I think it's just that now that we're into the new year, it's 2021, I wanted to make sure that I could reference the best line in cinema ever

48:50.000 --> 48:57.000
and make sure we get it in before we have to worry about it, which is the day that M. Bison invaded your city is the worst day of your life.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
For me, it was a Tuesday.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
It's just the best.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
It's very good.

49:02.000 --> 49:13.000
And as long as we're quoting Street Fighter adjacent things, I can't let the opportunity pass me by to quote the interview that somebody did with Jean-Claude Van Damme

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
when it was revealed that he had an affair with Kylie Minogue on the set and he said,

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
Okay, yes, yes, yes.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
It happened.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
I was in Thailand.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
We had an affair.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Sweet kiss, beautiful lovemaking.

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
Thanks, John.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Thanks, Jean-Claude.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
To be fair, I hope Jean-Claude Van Damme says something about me someday.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
Sweet kiss, beautiful lovemaking.

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
Beautiful lovemaking.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
Awesome.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
All I can say is Jean-Claude Van Damme.

49:37.000 --> 49:47.000
Do you guys know that the bad guy from Raiders, Bellic, was played by the same guy who played Ivan Ooze?

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
Really?

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
That's quite a trajectory, huh?

49:49.000 --> 49:55.000
You must have had one moment where they were putting on the applique on your face, the blue, the purple tentacles,

49:55.000 --> 49:59.000
where you're like, this is where I'm at currently, that's okay.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
What's Harrison Ford up to?

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
What's he doing?

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
I bet Harrison is maybe in the Mighty Morph-

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
You think he called Harrison Ford like,

50:05.000 --> 50:09.000
Hey, Harrison, are you in this Mighty Morph about Rangers movie too?

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
I assume you got the offer right alongside me?

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
Got an opportunity for you.

50:13.000 --> 50:17.000
This is a rocket, baby, going all the way to the top.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Harrison, can you put on your helmet?

50:19.000 --> 50:22.000
I'm not putting on my helmet.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
You're the Black Ranger, Harrison, please.

50:24.000 --> 50:28.000
I'm not doing it.

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
Where can people watch your program?

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
I mean, I guess the internet, right?

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
You get everything on the internet these days.

50:35.000 --> 50:41.000
Yes, you can watch The Higher Public Show on the Star Wars YouTube or on StarWars.com

50:41.000 --> 50:47.000
and you can check out more information about The Higher Public in that little tab about said show.

50:47.000 --> 50:52.000
And other than that, you can find me, oh, on Mondays I host a show called Improvised Champions

50:52.000 --> 50:56.000
with Mark Muir, who is the voice of Commander Shepard in Mass Effect.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
Oh, yeah.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
And there's someone who plays through the game, Idle Champions.

51:00.000 --> 51:07.000
We voice act all the characters and we also commentate as two of our original characters.

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
So it's really fun.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
That's fun.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
It's on the C&E Games Twitch.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
Cool.

51:12.000 --> 51:20.000
I also highly recommend if you are subscribed to Dropout, you can watch Dimension 20

51:20.000 --> 51:27.000
and Christina just did a series there on Dimension 20 called Pirates of Leviathan.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
And when she played Barbarella, it's very, very good.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
Oh, I need to say it for you.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Okay, please.

51:33.000 --> 51:38.000
Her name is Barbarella Zasparela Gangland, but you can call her Bob.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
That's really good.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
How talented people might be so angry.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
It must be so stressful to have talent.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
I can't imagine.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
You are in trolls.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
You are in trolls.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
You are an icon in this house.

51:48.000 --> 51:53.000
They let us talk at the same time and then they put it through a bunch of computers.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
You know how it is, the music industry.

51:55.000 --> 51:59.000
We watched it the other day and it's like my son's in a trance by it.

51:59.000 --> 52:06.000
So like my oldest comes in right at the part where it's the incredibly sad Kelly Clarkson song.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
And out comes the tumbleweed.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
You suck!

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
And everyone in my kitchen.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
Busting up, busting up.

52:13.000 --> 52:18.000
Some debate amongst the trolls community and our community about which one of the three of us that is.

52:18.000 --> 52:23.000
Credited in the books, in the IMDB books to the J-Man.

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
Definitely if you listen to the voice, it's absolutely Griffin.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
It's 100% Griffin.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
No question.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
But I'm on the poster.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
So, hey, Christina, thank you so much for joining us.

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
Really appreciate you being here.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
My pleasure.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
I think we've really helped this time.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
This person we've helped.

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
Yeah.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
Buy that ice cream, man.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
Buy that ice cream.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
Hey, Griff, how about a yahoo?

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Yeah, I have a very fast one here.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
I think this is going to be just a heads up call, like which way you're leaning on it.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.000
It was sent in by a bunch of people.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
Thanks, everybody.

52:49.000 --> 52:54.000
It's an anonymous yahoo answers user who I'm going to call Dump D asks.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
Oh, challenging.

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
Do you wish your bath could be the soup?

53:01.000 --> 53:08.000
Imagine taking a warm, relaxing bath and you can drink the savory fragrant soup as you bathe and dip crackers in it.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Now, now, now.

53:10.000 --> 53:18.000
Now, let's talk about doing it in the Japanese style because there is a sort of usually you'll shower off and then you'll get in the bath.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
Right.

53:19.000 --> 53:22.000
And the shower gets all the particulate.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
The gunk.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
The gunk.

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
Because you don't want to get in the bath and get your gunk all over the bath.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
And then somebody else gets in the bath later.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
No, no, no, no, no.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
You shower off first.

53:31.000 --> 53:37.000
So I would need a pre soup bath to even consider this.

53:37.000 --> 53:40.000
And even then, I'm sorry, you would never.

53:40.000 --> 53:41.000
I mean, you would never.

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
We are all of us made of stardust and gunk.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
We are we are made of gunk.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
If we clean off all the gunk, we'll make more gunk.

53:48.000 --> 53:58.000
But OK, but let me let me can I add an element here, which is to say how big a container before it would be dispersed enough.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
That's what I'm saying that you would be OK.

54:00.000 --> 54:06.000
Like you got into a lake of soup and you knew there were no fish or like rocks or anything.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
It's just you and the soup.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Is that then dispersed enough?

54:10.000 --> 54:20.000
Because I would posit the issue comes down to the twist is unless you have like a super long spoon, you're still eating the soup from immediately around your body.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
Yeah, sure.

54:21.000 --> 54:33.000
You would want to get, you know, you would want to dive down deep into the depths far from where your butt stuff and your pee pee stuff might accidentally get in your foot stuff and armpit stuff.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
Like those are the worst parts.

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
Your body stuff could just say your human body.

54:37.000 --> 54:41.000
Well, no, they're saying if I spill some soup on my thigh, I'll eat that right off there.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
That's not a problem.

54:42.000 --> 54:46.000
If I spill it on my butt, I'll spoon it up there.

54:46.000 --> 54:51.000
But if I drop soup on my foot or my penis or my butt or my armpits, then that's going in the trash.

54:51.000 --> 54:55.000
Or your hair or your face or your ears.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
If I get soup on my face.

54:57.000 --> 55:02.000
OK, you've never gotten you never been eating soup excited and you get soup on your face and you just kind of lick it off.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
No, no, no, I have a beard friend.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
I can't do that.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
OK.

55:07.000 --> 55:15.000
Yeah, but I got Travis really fucking knocked this one out of the park because the question is how big a body of soup do you need to be in?

55:15.000 --> 55:19.000
Because I would argue a bathtub is too small, too small.

55:19.000 --> 55:23.000
Because like at that point, so much of that soup is coming contact.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
Can we just can we OK.

55:24.000 --> 55:28.000
Can I let me in the interest of we all agree we're made of gunk.

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
Yeah.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
It's untrinkable.

55:30.000 --> 55:34.000
It's like Ralph Nader wrote undrinkable at any size.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
No, no.

55:36.000 --> 55:42.000
But let's pretend in a world where like we have we can divorce ourselves from like hygiene.

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
Right.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
What are you asking?

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
You get you get laminated before you go in.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
I don't I don't know.

55:47.000 --> 55:59.000
But like, let's talk about all other elements of this question, because I feel like will you enjoy the sensation, you know, of floating in a lake of chunky chunks?

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Of chunky chicken?

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
Hold on.

56:02.000 --> 56:08.000
Now, that is the other question, Justin, because I would I would argue I would fight so hard for tomato soup.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
Yeah.

56:09.000 --> 56:10.000
Wait.

56:10.000 --> 56:13.000
See, I go tomato, tomato, basil bisque, which I mean, sure.

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
As long as I can't see my own body in it.

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
So no broth.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
I want no chunks either.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
No chunks.

56:19.000 --> 56:20.000
No chunks.

56:20.000 --> 56:24.000
I got too many crannies and or nooks in my human body to do chunks.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
Yeah.

56:25.000 --> 56:28.000
I watch if I don't have chunks, I'll be hungry after.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Justin, we're not talking about Sacy.

56:30.000 --> 56:37.000
I assumed we were in a fear factor-esque scenario here and not like, well, this is my life now.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
Yeah.

56:38.000 --> 56:41.000
No, but like, what is somebody going to bring you bread?

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
Like, it doesn't make sense.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
Okay, but here's me.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.000
If I'm already good.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
Okay, listen.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
Okay, shut up.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
Shut up.

56:47.000 --> 56:56.000
If you painted soup and an hour later you tell your significant other, feeling a little peckish, they're going to look at you like,

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
didn't you just fucking bathe in soup?

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
Okay.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.000
How are you hungry?

57:01.000 --> 57:05.000
Justin, the other side of that is like, if you said, I'm starving, what should we do for dinner?

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
And then you saw a lake of soup and you said, never mind.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.000
Not that.

57:09.000 --> 57:10.000
Not that.

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
That would be completely bonkers.

57:13.000 --> 57:14.000
Here's me though.

57:14.000 --> 57:19.000
I'm over here getting showering off my pre-soup shower.

57:19.000 --> 57:25.000
Or maybe it's a burning, like in Andromeda Strain where they just kind of blast you with hot light.

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
And your outer layer of skin cells just comes off.

57:28.000 --> 57:31.000
And also a full, like, ne'er de-hairing.

57:31.000 --> 57:37.000
De-hairing, you are a perfectly hairless, beautiful, just harp seal.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
You're Neo in the Matrix, right?

57:38.000 --> 57:39.000
Yeah.

57:39.000 --> 57:40.000
When he first comes out of the pod.

57:40.000 --> 57:46.000
And then I walk over to the kitchen real quick and I do whip myself up a grilled cheese sammy, cut it in half.

57:46.000 --> 57:49.000
One half in each fist, run, jump into the tomato basil bisque lake.

57:49.000 --> 57:53.000
And now I'm having a fucking party.

57:53.000 --> 57:57.000
I mean, the ideal is you have a sandwich big enough to float on.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Goddamn grilled cheese out there.

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
You're floating on the grilled cheese.

58:00.000 --> 58:04.000
You're just ripping tiny pieces off, dipping it into the tomato soup lake.

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
That's the ideal.

58:05.000 --> 58:08.000
But admittedly, that is not the question, right?

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
I understand that.

58:09.000 --> 58:17.000
If I did enough deep grouting, I would get in a bathtub of tomato basil bisque and I would eat some of it.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
And I don't think that makes me nasty.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
I mean, you can think whatever you want, can't you?

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
Yeah.

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
Listen, Griffin, we can talk about if it's okay or not.

58:25.000 --> 58:33.000
But the way you said it made it a passionate thing, like a thing you wanted to do actively and that bothered me.

58:33.000 --> 58:37.000
Since we got rid of the chunks, I feel like everybody has kind of lost the passion for this, you know?

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Because it just doesn't make, it's not appetizing.

58:39.000 --> 58:40.000
Okay.

58:40.000 --> 58:43.000
Wait, Justin, can I follow you down this path in for a second?

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
When you're talking about these chunks.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Oh, wait, did you want me to list some of my favorite things?

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
No, we'll get there.

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000
When you're talking about chunks.

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Orzo for this table.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
Thank you.

58:52.000 --> 59:01.000
Are you talking about a lake with now in the can as exists on earth sized chunks or that this whole thing is scaled up?

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
In the can?

59:02.000 --> 59:03.000
No, no, no.

59:03.000 --> 59:04.000
Hear me out.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
I'm not bathing in cans.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.000
No, no, no.

59:06.000 --> 59:07.000
You're misunderstanding Travis' question.

59:07.000 --> 59:08.000
Please.

59:08.000 --> 59:13.000
What I'm saying is someone has taken soup that now exists on earth and filled the lake with it.

59:13.000 --> 59:21.000
Or rather we're in a honey, I shrunk the kids scenario where now you're shrunk down, the bowl is you sized and all the chunks are gigantic.

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
Right, yes.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
I don't want that, nobody wants that.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
Okay.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Okay, so you're just talking about small chunks.

59:26.000 --> 59:30.000
No, I'm just talking about open my mouth and let a little Orzo slip in, you know?

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
Yeah.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
You're going to munch, munch, munch around this lake.

59:33.000 --> 59:38.000
Well, no, I think Justin's talking about filtering Orzo through his teeth like baleen.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
Ah.

59:39.000 --> 59:45.000
Exactly, and I'll actually have to filter out the bay leaves too because it's a very fancy soup.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Yeah, it's a very fancy soup.

59:47.000 --> 59:52.000
Now if you could give me a matzah ball perhaps to float on, that would be ideal.

59:52.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Now that would be fucking great is if there was lake sized matzah ball soup with one big fucking matzah ball right in the center that you had to sort of climb king of the hill style.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:10.000
You can't just make a soup wonderland for you to play in, you're like inventing this chiliwonka style landscape where you're just floating.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Come with me, have a bean.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Yes.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
You can't just make it a playground, it's just soup.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Fuck.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
But why not, Justin?

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Why can't we dance on moonbeams and have big old chunkums?

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:31.000
You're like, you're like, you're perverting the whole idea of a theoretical question.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:43.000
It would be like saying like, hey, imagine you could take a bath in soup and also your right arm becomes incredibly strong and powerful, able to lift anything.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
It's like, well, yeah, I'd go ahead and do that.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
But you're not, you're just talking about taking a bath in soup.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
It's not hard, it's just a question.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000
I apologize, I thought that was going to be a quick one.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Well, no dice. Thanks for listening to our program.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.000
I feel like, by the way, that is unanswered still.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
I feel like we did not reach a core.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
I answered it, I said yes.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:11.000
I just feel like what we answered is something more important, which is that we're three different people with different priorities about soup.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Yeah, but I feel like this is the first time in like 547 episodes that the three of us been so divided on an issue.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.000
That like, I feel like I don't know you, Justin.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000
That's an exciting new chapter to end our show on.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Thanks for listening to our program.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
We hope you enjoyed yourself.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Thanks to MaxFun for having us as a part of their extended podcasting family.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Thanks to you for listening.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
I think we got some new merch.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Oh yeah, there is.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Justin, let me tell you about it because it's very exciting.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
We've got a really great boy car pin of the month.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
It's so good.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000
We've got the Taste of Luxury Shirt designed by Kevin Budnick.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
So cute.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:36.000
But the main thing is our Adventure Zone live virtual show happening February 19th at 9pm.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
It's a 9pm Eastern, I should say.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
It's virtual and interactive.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:48.000
So there will come major points where you, the audience, will get to vote on what the player characters will need to do.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000
And we're going to be playing Honey Heist with special guest Erica Ishii, which is very exciting.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Erica is amazing.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Tickets are only $10 and you can get them at live.themacroy.family.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
We're close on that new theme song.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Oh, so close.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
So watch this space.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000
So when I say we, I mean the people who are actually working on the song.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
But it's nearly finished.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
We had input in it.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
That's real good.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I guess so, yeah.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
You're doing good.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Do a good job.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Maybe more drums or maybe less.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Have you thought about adding in a note here that's like, buh, buh, buh?

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
So here's that final.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
It was sent in also by thewizardbencan.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Thank you, Ben.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000
You crushed it.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000
It's from a Yahoo Answers user, Vic, who asks,

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.000
If Michelangelo painted the 16 Chapel, who painted the first 15 chapels?

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Oh boy.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Hey.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Thanks for listening to our podcast.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Kiss your dad's scrub lips.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Wait, are we supposed to say our names?

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Travis.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Wait.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Oh, Travis.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
It fell off.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
It fell off.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
I'm Travis.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
I'm Travis.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
I'm Griffin.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I'm not saying it again.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Okay, that was the show.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Hope you had some fun.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Talked for an hour and now our job is done.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Go back into the world.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Face the day ahead.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Please don't tell our grandparents all the cuss words we said.
