WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660

01:58.580 --> 02:04.220
Oh, yeah, so I wish for this fucking guy can't stop pranking the Avengers

02:04.220 --> 02:09.380
No, so this is the thing. So I'm I'm watching doesn't fail. Let me get a quick

02:09.380 --> 02:13.500
Let me get out my comedy dousing rod because right now it's pointing away. Yeah, I've got my

02:15.700 --> 02:21.900
Rotating with you. Let's see it. I'm so I'm watching my nature programs that you know

02:21.900 --> 02:25.420
I love yeah TV that my grandnephew set up for me, right?

02:25.420 --> 02:31.820
And then I finished those now pop-up comes up for this Loki and I see that Owen Wilson is in it

02:31.820 --> 02:37.100
You know, I'm a big drill bit Taylor fan. Yeah, it's your favorite. Yeah, I click on it and I'm watching it

02:37.100 --> 02:39.740
Yeah, I want to talk about this Loki fellow

02:40.340 --> 02:45.780
Because everybody seems to like him. Yeah, but he seems like a superhero version of a YouTube prankster

02:45.820 --> 02:52.220
Yeah, and I don't know that I'm comfortable with the world watch it. It's on and can I say it's on the Disney thing?

02:52.220 --> 02:57.980
Right next to Mickey. This is my problem with right with Mickey. He's doing this right near it

02:57.980 --> 03:02.300
We're Mickey can write for the love of Christ. It's like he's Mickey's next-door neighbor now

03:02.300 --> 03:06.940
Yeah, Mickey live next to Loki. I know will you agree on one thing?

03:07.820 --> 03:09.900
There's nothing low-key about it. No

03:10.580 --> 03:14.300
This guy is amped up. So I don't understand that part for sure

03:14.300 --> 03:18.660
Now listen Owen Wilson's there and he is definitely bringing it down. All right, he's a little hand

03:18.660 --> 03:23.940
Hold I am I am holding on tight to Owen Wilson as I try to ride out this confusing

03:23.940 --> 03:27.020
I hate this fucking guy with the horns cuz he's always

03:27.340 --> 03:33.060
Breaking the Avengers and now he's being mean to Owen Wilson aka drill bit Taylor, right?

03:33.580 --> 03:40.620
Right and Owen Wilson doesn't need that. He's Owen Wilson. He's been in many movies a lot of movies

03:40.620 --> 03:47.020
What's this low-key guy ever done? Yeah, except hurt the Avengers feelings. We mean to him. He made the whole cry

03:47.020 --> 03:54.740
Henry's obsessed with superheroes and he has been for a long time and they make these like books for like the world of reading books

03:54.740 --> 04:01.440
They're like, here's here's very simple sentences and words and there's ones where they're at a daycare and low-key

04:01.540 --> 04:08.820
Like steals the Hulk's the paints the Hulk purple instead of green and steals the apple slices from snack time

04:09.060 --> 04:15.340
And then at the end he like get they confront him and he comes clean and I want to be like this man has killed

04:15.340 --> 04:20.820
People this man is killed in the fit in the fit. I'm not a big, you know

04:20.820 --> 04:24.020
I'm not deep in the Avengers set but I do know that this man is

04:24.580 --> 04:29.780
Responsible for the deaths of countless innocent New Yorkers. We love to forget that don't we?

04:29.780 --> 04:34.380
Yeah, we strut we stride into a hot topic by the first cool t-shirt

04:34.380 --> 04:40.660
We see low-key on it and we just forget this man has murdered people. Yeah, there's blood on these on his

04:40.660 --> 04:47.560
His a yeah now don't get me wrong. I like the t-shirt where he's kind of giving us more gonna just as mischief question mark

04:47.560 --> 04:49.780
It's not the most creative, but I love that font

04:54.740 --> 04:58.000
What this man's a murderer hey Justin Justin

04:58.580 --> 05:06.460
Loki charms. Well, no fucking yeah trap fucking dirt bag. No fucking shit. Why do you think they did it?

05:06.460 --> 05:12.380
Otherwise bud, I don't know because he's whimsical. No, cuz it sounds like Loki. Oh, you know what?

05:12.380 --> 05:17.380
You're the Loki of this show. Now. I've just decided. Yeah. Oh, no, you're the Loki of it and you're a villain of it

05:17.380 --> 05:19.780
I know I've been that for a while. Come on, man

05:20.580 --> 05:25.980
Get with it. But here's my question. Yeah, am I supposed to like him this murder?

05:27.580 --> 05:29.700
Relentless murderer. I

05:30.540 --> 05:32.540
the first scene of

05:32.940 --> 05:34.860
the Loki show

05:34.860 --> 05:38.020
Should be Loki and he's it might be

05:40.060 --> 05:43.340
And he should be like hi America, it's me look

05:43.340 --> 05:49.380
I just wanted to say that thanks for taking the chance on my television show and I just want to promise you that well

05:49.380 --> 05:54.660
I'm not gonna do no murders in this one. So if you give me a chance, let me be the hero you deserve

05:54.660 --> 05:59.820
I promise I could do a better job for you America. Enjoy my show. I'm sorry. I'm right next to Mickey

05:59.820 --> 06:05.020
Do you think that there's somebody in the Marvel like big boardroom somewhere who's like?

06:05.220 --> 06:11.180
Can we do a George Lucas on the Avengers movie and just add a quick scene or Captain America?

06:11.180 --> 06:16.660
They've they've stopped Loki, but they look around and go pretty incredible that no one got hurt during this, huh? Yes

06:17.460 --> 06:19.460
We just seem to avoid

06:19.480 --> 06:23.940
Anyone getting hurt during this entire battle, huh?

06:23.940 --> 06:27.220
Bunch of buildings fell down air-conditioned came took tumble

06:27.220 --> 06:30.820
But each time it just barely missed the people you're lucky this time Loki

06:30.820 --> 06:35.020
They should call you Loki charms and then everybody was at the big game

06:35.420 --> 06:39.660
Everyone nobody was even in these buildings. How fortuitous

06:40.860 --> 06:48.260
He's a murderer and this shows murdering him with all the jokes so far and I want to get into some questions

06:48.260 --> 06:58.100
Maybe just to say we actually start the show in earnest at this point. I'm I will say this. Oh, oh, oh What's up guys

06:58.700 --> 07:02.860
No, she's us. Hey guys big news for you. Yeah

Yeah, one of those classic. How about question? I would I would absolutely love that

16:04.760 --> 16:10.480
My grandparents just gave me $500 worth of jewelry for graduation and I don't really mean to sound ungrateful

16:10.480 --> 16:13.080
But this is the ugliest jewelry I've ever seen. I wish I do

16:13.560 --> 16:20.320
This is you've defined ungrateful, but let's move press on I don't want to pawn it and they ask you about it later

16:20.440 --> 16:22.440
But I really don't think I'll ever wear it ever

16:23.000 --> 16:25.920
That's from $500 ugly jewelry owner

16:25.920 --> 16:27.520
Um

16:27.520 --> 16:30.320
This is a actually easy one. Oh

16:30.880 --> 16:34.640
Yeah, finally an easy one. You gotta just pretend like it's

16:36.040 --> 16:40.320
$6 jewelry and what would you do if you had gotten $6 jewelry?

16:40.720 --> 16:47.760
You would just put it in the place where jewelry goes which for me is the underwear drawer

16:47.760 --> 16:54.160
just kind of loose rattling around in there with what with my cigar colognes and what have you and

16:54.160 --> 16:58.240
Then you can just keep on keeping on

16:59.440 --> 17:02.820
Yeah, we maybe wonder Griffin if this is a phenomenon that

17:03.520 --> 17:08.040
Many people experience where if you are not a fancy person

17:08.560 --> 17:14.880
But you get the kind of thing that a fancy person would have you bestow upon it a sacred

17:15.400 --> 17:20.660
Safe place of inside the underwear drawer towards the bottom where it's not gonna interrupt your life

17:20.660 --> 17:27.660
But it is safely protected but beneath your unmentionable. No criminal will ever look there if you think about perhaps

17:28.460 --> 17:32.940
Cuff links. Yeah. Well, that's something a fancy person. It's not a monetary thing

17:32.940 --> 17:38.900
It's just like this is something where if I'm a different person, this would be something I would need ready access

17:38.900 --> 17:42.740
Yeah, there'll be something I like madly dig for before a few

17:42.740 --> 17:45.300
Well, that's the thing if you only have one set of cuff links

17:45.300 --> 17:48.340
You're not going to invest in some sort of cuff link caddy, right?

17:48.340 --> 17:54.780
Right, you're not gonna have a special storage place. I'm sure there is a tipping point where you have enough set of cuff links

17:54.980 --> 17:58.980
That you're like, I need something to store these bad boys. I don't know what that

17:59.580 --> 18:05.620
Tipping point is but it's not one set. It might be two sets. Yeah, I got a nice watch

18:05.620 --> 18:09.380
Somebody got me as a gift once and I'm not a big watch wear because I need

18:09.940 --> 18:14.100
Absolute maximum flexibility and mobility to do all my gaming

18:14.100 --> 18:18.420
Uh, but it is a nice watch so it lives in my underwear drawer

18:19.180 --> 18:26.020
Like the fucking food in the peewee's playhouse freezer just having a little home and its own little life in there

18:26.020 --> 18:31.300
It's got its own kids of the kids are it's are the ties that I haven't worn in

18:31.940 --> 18:33.940
Since I had a child

18:34.900 --> 18:39.840
Yeah, don't be ashamed don't be and if it if the grandparents ask about you just say yeah, okay

18:39.840 --> 18:43.620
Yeah, I'm not wearing it today. I love it. It's so good, but I'm not wearing it today

18:43.620 --> 18:45.620
What do you think it looks like? What do you think?

18:45.980 --> 18:46.980
Chonky

18:46.980 --> 18:53.420
Chonky, I mean some people like a chunky like a chunky necklace some people like chunky accessories. It's a that's a that's a thing

18:54.020 --> 18:59.140
Yeah, Griffin's right. You should wear it. No one cuz maybe you think it's ugly, but everyone else thinks it's beautiful

18:59.140 --> 19:00.860
What do you know? Well, maybe that's it

19:00.860 --> 19:03.380
Maybe it's the way that you look at it in the mirror is backwards

19:03.380 --> 19:08.100
And so it looks bad to you, but when you look at the right way, it looks actually super good

19:08.260 --> 19:12.020
Why would you give me a bracelet with my name spelled backwards on it grandpa?

19:12.020 --> 19:14.540
I hate you grandpa. You tried to trick me again

19:15.340 --> 19:19.860
Try to get me to say my name backwards and get banished to another dimension against nice try

19:20.740 --> 19:25.900
You and Superman always trying to get me. Can I shower you guys with some wisdom of the cloud?

19:25.900 --> 19:27.740
Oh, I love that

19:27.740 --> 19:33.300
This one is a it is another wiki house just because I it's what's got me excited right now

19:33.300 --> 19:37.460
I've looked at others, but this is what's doing it for me Christopher sent this in. Thanks Chris

19:37.460 --> 19:42.180
It's uh, this one's authored by the wiki house staff. So

19:42.780 --> 19:49.020
And it's updated May 6th. So this is we got like hot up-to-the-minute deets on how to get shampoo out of your eyes

19:49.460 --> 19:55.220
And you may think you've got this one solved and I think this actually is cyclical because we did talk about this

19:55.220 --> 19:59.460
I feel like early my bim-bam we talked about like sort of maybe episode one

19:59.460 --> 20:04.420
Maybe even episode one getting shampoo out of your eyes with water part one

20:04.420 --> 20:10.100
can I can I just say by the way this also falls into the category that I think the coyote one fits to you of

20:10.220 --> 20:15.860
Like just go ahead and look this out ahead of time. Yes, you find yourself in the scenario. It's too late

20:15.860 --> 20:21.220
It's too late and in the spirit of that the very first step that they have listed here is so good

20:21.220 --> 20:23.220
And it's simply calm down

20:26.140 --> 20:27.580
If the shampoos in your eyes

20:27.580 --> 20:31.420
You may experience a burning or stinging sensation pain can often lead us to panic staying calm

20:31.420 --> 20:36.780
I'm sure you do not do anything which might make the situation worse like put more shampoo in your eyes

20:37.100 --> 20:39.100
Well, you want to wash out that shampoo?

20:40.220 --> 20:42.220
Shit way

20:42.420 --> 20:46.060
Well, sometimes I panic and maybe fall through like a sliding glass door

20:46.540 --> 20:53.140
Or I just start smashing bottles on the ground in a panic, you know, I pull the fixtures off the walls

20:53.300 --> 20:57.500
Yeah, it tells you to breathe in your nose to a count of five and exhale through your mouth for a count of five

20:57.500 --> 20:58.640
Do this at least three times

20:58.640 --> 21:02.620
You may also envision yourself in a peaceful scene where nothing hurts you and you are not in danger

21:02.980 --> 21:03.780
for instance

21:03.780 --> 21:08.580
You're bashing yourself on a peaceful mountain top try to imagine the breeze on your face and the gentle warmth of the Sun on

21:08.580 --> 21:11.560
Your skin if you get shampoo in your eyes

21:12.260 --> 21:15.540
breathe for 15 seconds and then

21:16.180 --> 21:18.060
You're on the mountaintop in your mind

21:18.060 --> 21:23.380
And at that point your eyes have dissolved out of your head because you've taken way too long to address the situation

21:23.380 --> 21:29.460
I want them to continue this kind of vibe and like in sentences with we're gonna get through this

21:29.460 --> 21:35.200
Yeah, I'm here for you. Take a deep breath rub your eyes. No, just kidding. It says don't rub your eyes

21:36.700 --> 21:39.300
There's chemicals in shampoo that hurts your eyes

21:40.180 --> 21:43.340
Step three close your step three close your eyes

21:43.340 --> 21:53.660
And if you need more information here, it literally says bring your top and bottom eyelids together to close them

21:53.660 --> 21:55.780
Where I think okay. Wait, are you fucking with me?

21:55.940 --> 22:00.760
Is this whole thing been are you fucking with me the steps so far just to recap?

22:00.980 --> 22:02.660
Calm the calm the fuck down

22:02.660 --> 22:07.300
Don't touch your eyes close your eyes and then for two to three minutes

22:07.340 --> 22:12.220
Look up into the faucet and let the water hit your eyeballs for two to three minutes

22:12.220 --> 22:17.880
For two to three minutes let cool water blast your open eyeballs and feel it

22:17.980 --> 22:24.820
This escalates so quickly from like I'm on a mountaintop to I'm gonna let water blast my open eyes

22:24.820 --> 22:26.820
It's step five simply

22:27.980 --> 22:29.980
Try to cry

22:30.060 --> 22:33.160
Not hard. Yeah, I don't take a lot for me

22:33.160 --> 22:37.180
Well, I just think about the ending of iron giant and I'm gone. Yeah

22:37.180 --> 22:41.340
Well, if that doesn't work for you wiki how does say crying on command takes long practice

22:41.340 --> 22:43.340
It sure does

22:46.340 --> 22:52.340
Thinking of tragic thoughts like being a child alone and scared in the woods is a good way to inspire tears

22:52.340 --> 22:58.020
Hey, let's fuck you. No, I just told me to picture myself on a mountaintop. Yeah, I calm myself way down

22:58.580 --> 23:01.880
Yeah, now you want me to be a scared kid in the wood. Which one is it?

23:01.940 --> 23:03.140
Well, no Travis

23:03.140 --> 23:07.940
You got to get calm in order to open your eyes and look into a running faucet for two to three minutes

23:07.940 --> 23:13.620
And then after that you have to try to cry you need to try to cry and then you need to see a doctor if it

23:13.620 --> 23:17.180
Continues to hurt. Okay, the next step sucks so bad

23:18.140 --> 23:20.500
Hit me avoiding shampoo in your eyes

23:21.500 --> 23:25.780
Okay. Well, come on lean your head back 45 degrees when shampooing

23:26.500 --> 23:29.240
That's awesome. I love that. They put a number to it

23:31.180 --> 23:33.740
Next time I need like a protractor in the shower

23:33.740 --> 23:38.500
Make sure I get the next time I'm in the shower. I'm gonna make sure that I'm not doing it at 30

23:38.500 --> 23:44.260
I get I still get some shampoo in my eyes. It might be a 30 degree angle situation

23:44.260 --> 23:47.220
Do you guys do you guys if you're showering your head off, right?

23:47.360 --> 23:52.300
Do you face the spigot and just like go for it or do you?

23:52.740 --> 24:00.260
Turn around away from the spigot and like lean your head back like you're at a fancy salon. Mmm. I don't know

24:00.260 --> 24:06.860
I genuinely don't I think I right now you're thinking have I ever watched I've ever washed my hair before I

24:08.620 --> 24:14.100
Know I do. I mean I have to use some pretty bodacious stuff on my rig not to get too

24:14.580 --> 24:18.860
Not to get too clinical on the podcast, but that's why you got some

24:19.500 --> 24:25.340
Oh, I got some anti-dandruff. It is a fucking cakewalk compared to what I have to rub up there

24:25.340 --> 24:31.940
Let's just say let's just say Papa guts to rub some dry shampoo in there for his delicate condition sometimes

24:32.060 --> 24:37.620
So you gotta start with dry shampoo and then do a somewhat moist shampoo and then a full-blown wet shampoo

24:37.620 --> 24:40.540
And then a wet shampoo. I have to walk my way up not like the rest you guys

24:40.540 --> 24:45.380
You're just like head and shoulders go I have for me. It's a it's half a day

24:47.260 --> 24:51.900
There's some other steps in here including read the directions and again don't touch your eyes

24:51.900 --> 24:56.140
But the most awesome one is step six

24:56.860 --> 24:58.860
wear protective eyewear

25:00.300 --> 25:04.740
Goggles in the shower shampoo in your eyes causes a particularly acute irritation

25:04.740 --> 25:08.820
You can purchase it's intended for aquatic environments from your local sporting goods store

25:08.900 --> 25:14.100
Where then when shampooing but remove them after you finish rinsing the shampoo out so to ensure your face gets washed properly

25:14.100 --> 25:21.860
It's great because you can go to your local Dix and you can walk into the counter with this thought just please fucking nobody asks

25:21.860 --> 25:26.420
So you please no one else. Please don't ask what they're for. Please. Please please doing some swimming

25:28.940 --> 25:30.940
But then how do I wash my eyelashes

25:31.660 --> 25:37.420
Cuz those things get pretty dirty like a lot of sweat catches up in there. Yeah, they get crusty

25:37.420 --> 25:40.340
How will you wash your face? I guess separately

25:40.340 --> 25:46.260
Um, well when I do wiki how on here, you're only getting half the story because the pictures are what's so dope

25:47.140 --> 25:52.480
because there is there is this great image of a man wearing these these goggles and

25:53.620 --> 25:55.620
scrubbing scrubbing

25:57.660 --> 25:59.660
Travis I got another one for you because

26:00.060 --> 26:06.700
There's step seven try a tears-free shampoo. And then there's step eight, which is use an eye shield

26:06.700 --> 26:12.540
Which is something that I use for my toddler to wash. Oh, yeah

26:12.740 --> 26:16.660
And this is a cool look. This is like a bonnet for an adult

26:17.060 --> 26:23.060
This also it looks it looks like an old man wearing a sun hat except a bird stole the top of it

26:23.060 --> 26:26.780
Yeah, so it's just the brim part this hats solution

26:27.260 --> 26:32.460
Assumes I'm not washing the back of my hair. Yeah. Yeah, that's what it's why yeah, don't worry about it

26:32.860 --> 26:35.300
So time for the questions segment

26:35.300 --> 26:38.060
After I do the procedure, can I go to sleep?

26:38.420 --> 26:42.540
I'm not sure what the procedure the only thing resembling a procedure here is

26:42.900 --> 26:46.360
Keeping your eyes open for two to three minutes as you look into a running faucet

26:46.940 --> 26:50.140
But they'd say go ahead and go to sleep if you've washed it

26:50.740 --> 26:55.020
Not a concussion. They still might burn a bit and you might cry, but it should be fine

26:55.020 --> 26:57.740
If anything, that'll that'll help you sack out

26:58.500 --> 27:00.340
You know what? I mean?

27:00.340 --> 27:05.780
Yeah, that's fair. Like I mean, I'm I'm crazy about all these that are like just don't get it in your eyes in the first

27:05.780 --> 27:07.780
Yeah, but I guess I mean

27:08.660 --> 27:10.660
If I'm googling it

27:10.980 --> 27:15.700
Wiki howling it. I'm probably not in the shower anymore. Right? Like the immediate danger has passed

27:15.700 --> 27:20.980
Well, this is why you have to prep it beforehand and I was thinking about this because like that two to three minutes

27:21.220 --> 27:26.940
It's really hard to like figure out the time like your eyes are full of tears and water at this point

27:26.940 --> 27:29.220
You can't look at the clock. So here's I looked it up

27:29.220 --> 27:36.020
Just sing all of the mama's on the pub is California dreamin and that's to get two minutes and 45 seconds

27:36.020 --> 27:40.740
Perfect the perfect amount, right? So at that point you're probably good to stop blinking

27:40.740 --> 27:45.700
There's a is you got to read up on this shit though because this person said I did rub my eyes

27:45.700 --> 27:48.500
But I'm out of the shower and it still burns after I put water in it

27:48.500 --> 27:52.260
What should I do and the the community answer here like tries to offer some advice

27:52.260 --> 27:57.860
But at this point like you're you are fucking you fuck dog. You touched your eyes. That's like you touch number one

27:57.860 --> 28:04.380
The first rule it says what not to do that and you're like I did it now what?

28:04.660 --> 28:05.940
Yeah fucked up

28:05.940 --> 28:11.060
It's like if there was a wiki how article on how not to get stabbed and the first part was don't get stabbed

28:11.060 --> 28:14.120
And you're like I did it. I did get a little so now what I do

28:14.780 --> 28:19.100
Well, there is some extra stuff here cuz somebody said are there other tips if none of these methods work?

28:19.100 --> 28:25.100
I think if you've hit the point where you kept your eyes open for two to three minutes while water blasted it and that did

28:25.100 --> 28:27.940
Not work. It might not be a shampoo situation

28:27.940 --> 28:30.420
It might be a poisoning or something like that

28:30.420 --> 28:34.780
But there is a community answer that says cup cool water in your hands and put them up to your eyes

28:34.940 --> 28:39.700
Then open your eyes for a few seconds in the clean water repeating as necessary

28:40.580 --> 28:46.580
Awesome. That's a different delivery method then look at the faucet and let it spray into your eyes

28:46.580 --> 28:51.820
well, that's making your eyes too big beautiful burp baths and open them in there and

28:51.820 --> 28:56.300
That is swim around. Nobody can do that. I

28:58.340 --> 28:59.940
Can do it

28:59.940 --> 29:01.620
Here's another question

29:01.620 --> 29:06.580
Soon, I will be riding a horse nice and I would like to make a horse riding playlist

29:06.580 --> 29:12.140
I will be riding the horse through a field and some forests in the temperate rainforests of Vancouver Island

29:12.140 --> 29:13.940
I believe it will be a great horse

29:13.940 --> 29:14.260
Thank you

29:14.260 --> 29:21.460
Help me choose songs to set the tone and atmosphere for this unforgettable experience from melodious mayor in sandwich, BC Canada

29:21.460 --> 29:24.260
So first off, thank you. Yes

29:24.900 --> 29:31.060
For your fucking context. Yeah, so we I wish everybody would follow this this model

29:31.140 --> 29:36.260
Give us all the details you have that completely changes if you're gonna be in a temperate rainforest

29:36.260 --> 29:41.280
Do you know how many times we've done this and then the person has written back and back but the horse is gray and it's like

29:41.280 --> 29:46.820
Well fuck you didn't say that and then completely changes the answers, of course

29:46.820 --> 29:53.180
Well, there's one piece of deets that we did not get what's that? Are we walking? Are we trotting?

29:53.180 --> 29:59.020
Are we cantering? Are we galloping? Like I need to you know what I mean? How am I supposed to match the BPM?

29:59.540 --> 30:03.780
My my assumption is field is probably canter

30:04.740 --> 30:06.740
forest temperate

30:07.100 --> 30:09.020
rainforest forest

30:09.020 --> 30:14.860
Maybe trot but probably walk. Okay, it's hard you look I'm looking at pictures of this terrain

30:14.860 --> 30:16.860
Yeah, and some of it is like

30:17.260 --> 30:23.880
Honestly pretty terrifying. Oh, really? I'm looking at this terrain and it's like just like if I was I mean, it's beautiful

30:24.180 --> 30:28.220
but like I'm looking at these pictures of Vancouver Island rainforest and it's like

30:28.820 --> 30:34.220
If I had some of that hard charging and I try to take my horse at that

30:35.300 --> 30:39.420
You know what I mean? It's like if I'm ripping like aces spades, you know

30:39.420 --> 30:45.860
Sure, um two minutes to midnight something like really fucking rip. Yeah, and I have my horse

30:46.820 --> 30:52.420
The big Polly as he's asked to be called and if I have him like ripping through the forest that speed

30:52.420 --> 30:56.060
Yeah, I thought I'm gonna take a header for sure into a creek or yeah

30:57.300 --> 31:04.320
It's terrifying only in the context of racing through it in on a horse in any other context the

31:04.900 --> 31:06.900
rainforest of Vancouver Island is

31:06.900 --> 31:14.620
Breathtakingly beautiful. I that y'all this is stunning and I'm feeling honestly a little panicky that I haven't done this and like I got

31:14.620 --> 31:20.380
As far as Vancouver and those these beautiful rainforests were just right around the corner from

31:21.380 --> 31:22.620
ostensibly

31:22.620 --> 31:28.060
And I didn't I didn't get over there. Okay, so let me let me put put it. Hey, I got it

31:28.060 --> 31:30.060
I want to tell you guys something. Yeah

31:30.060 --> 31:32.260
That I just found in the

31:35.260 --> 31:43.620
I was looking for images of the big beautiful trees on Vancouver Island in the rainforest there and I stumbled on a

31:43.740 --> 31:45.000
digital book

31:45.000 --> 31:49.780
That is just called where to find big trees on Vancouver. Yeah, nice

31:49.780 --> 31:52.300
So if you want to not waste your time, yeah

31:52.300 --> 31:56.100
There's nothing worse than when to go see a big tree and you look all over like all these trees are fine

31:56.100 --> 32:03.540
but yeah, you're fine, but they're not like Here's what I would say you guys immediately went to this like

32:04.260 --> 32:06.260
hard-pounding like high-pace

32:06.580 --> 32:08.940
Octane kind of that's not fair. That's not fair

32:08.940 --> 32:12.500
I asked what the speed of the horse was before I recommend fair fair fair fair fair

32:12.500 --> 32:18.980
I let me put it this way then I would have for me if I'm setting the mood on a gray horse

32:18.980 --> 32:26.860
I in the temperate Vancouver Island rainforest. Yeah, I'm looking for more of a like

32:26.860 --> 32:33.860
I'm I'm free. This is free. I'm out here. Maybe I'm the last human being and like this is

32:34.940 --> 32:37.780
I think that's more the vibe. I'm going for

32:38.900 --> 32:41.300
And for that it's probably Bon Jovi

32:42.900 --> 32:44.980
Exclusively just obvious one

32:44.980 --> 32:51.500
I worry. It's not the one where he talks about horses. No, that's what that one's about a motorcycle

32:52.060 --> 32:58.100
The steel horse is a motorcycle. You're talking about some of his lovely ballads. Yeah, I'm saying like a

32:58.580 --> 33:02.940
Bed of roses. Yeah, right. That's beautiful. Just my horse out there

33:03.700 --> 33:07.500
We're doing down and maybe some I might also go for some melon camp in there

33:07.500 --> 33:13.920
Uh, I just some good old Americana to ride through the Canadian

33:17.940 --> 33:19.940
Canadian he

33:20.980 --> 33:28.460
Like 100% feels like I don't think he is but like it does feel like he's missing opportunity by not being Canadian doesn't yeah

33:29.500 --> 33:30.540
Yeah

33:30.540 --> 33:34.600
Um, I mean honest answer if I'm in lovely nature like this

33:34.600 --> 33:38.740
I want some pensive music on my throne some bony bear and just like cruise on them

33:38.740 --> 33:45.440
But the real even more honest answer is if I'm on a horse and this particular beautiful

33:46.100 --> 33:50.940
Albeit, let's say slippery and Viron. I am going to want

33:51.820 --> 33:56.780
Complete situational awareness. I do not want to remove one of my senses

33:57.660 --> 34:01.060
from the horseback riding in the slippery woods

34:01.060 --> 34:09.100
Activity that I'm doing because I don't know if I'm gonna hear like the sound of my my beautiful ponies hooves going like

34:09.560 --> 34:11.560
As they slip off the bridge that we're crossing

34:12.000 --> 34:14.600
But I need to have that I need to have those clues

34:14.600 --> 34:18.520
What would that be to the horse what I need to do to it to make it not fall off the bridge?

34:18.520 --> 34:26.000
Oh, you know touch it Britain go touch the go button on say hey look out across the bridge or to say like

34:27.200 --> 34:29.200
Look out. Oh, look out crackers

34:29.200 --> 34:35.140
That's in the name of a horse. You got to go. Oh, you got to stay on the straight narrow, and he would go

34:35.760 --> 34:39.600
But if he did if I don't hear him slipping because I'm listening a bony bear

34:39.600 --> 34:41.960
But you died together and the horse will die

34:42.560 --> 34:47.900
There's also gonna be there's gonna be great sounds in this for like that's the playlist is

34:52.680 --> 34:54.680
Like the sounds of

34:54.680 --> 35:02.080
Maybe yeah, maybe the perfect thing is if you find an audio track array for his sounds and listen to them at the bout

35:02.080 --> 35:05.200
The right volume where just it's like the force

35:06.200 --> 35:13.560
You know it's like just more you just like whatever it would have normally it just kind of like yeah twice as long

35:13.680 --> 35:15.680
So you're really like?

35:16.080 --> 35:18.480
Okay, wait a big business opportunity

35:19.560 --> 35:23.560
Sound of walking through the forest riding a horse through the forest all of that, but add to it

35:23.560 --> 35:30.540
Celebrity cameos you're walking down, and you run into Tom Holland, and he joins you on the walk for a little while yes

35:31.080 --> 35:34.580
Don't you don't look behind you governor, but I'm here

35:35.080 --> 35:38.880
And I'll be I'm really here go protecting you

35:39.440 --> 35:43.640
Always we could have it even be like an in fiction thing where it's not Tom Holland

35:43.640 --> 35:48.120
But it is Tom Holland, and he's like a little he's a wood nymph. Yeah, and so you hear like

35:48.760 --> 35:52.420
It's me Tom. Oh, that's why you can't hear him cuz he's so tiny exactly exactly

35:52.420 --> 35:59.260
Exactly my my home didn't cha see I was gonna say and maybe that we can do both these things in one track

35:59.260 --> 36:04.340
Is you go post up at a rainforest cafe for a couple hours, and you just record?

36:05.140 --> 36:10.500
Just a little bit of back. We get some room tone. I'm your waiter for today aren't I?

36:12.580 --> 36:18.440
You want me to I'm your I'm your way to Tom Hines you hear about the specials today the rain forest cafe

36:18.440 --> 36:24.580
Oh, do we get the research from Jordan in this one Nathan Drake's a waiter

36:26.660 --> 36:28.660
Change don't tell anybody

36:35.660 --> 36:42.540
Now it's time to stop okay doing jokes to talk about the only thing that matters in this world is business, okay

36:42.540 --> 36:48.540
Let's go to the money zone

36:53.700 --> 36:58.800
Being a local bon vivant man about town or it boy takes work and poise

36:58.940 --> 37:02.480
But it doesn't actually have to take a ton of money if you have honey

37:02.880 --> 37:06.460
The easy way to get yourself a little taste of luxury

37:06.460 --> 37:12.820
Once you add honey to your computer just shop like normal on thousands of your favorite sites even

37:13.540 --> 37:15.980
Luxury, I just want to start with you know up real quick

37:15.980 --> 37:23.220
Don't add honey lowercase H to your computer that will break your computer break this is this is capital a tiny trap

37:23.220 --> 37:28.500
Okay, now if you just click apply coupons a checkout when honey drops down

37:28.500 --> 37:34.140
And if it finds a working coupon you'll see the price drop right before your very eyes and voila

37:34.140 --> 37:38.780
You can indulge in a little opulence for a fraction of the cost I

37:39.980 --> 37:47.780
Adore using honey. I've been using it to save myself a few extra bucks whether I'm shopping for different caviar gloves or

37:48.420 --> 37:50.420
other different fancy stuff I

37:51.420 --> 37:58.900
Always use honey, and it has saved me upwards of 17 perhaps even $18 in some cases on a wide

37:58.900 --> 38:04.660
Variety of products perhaps more perhaps save me so much more than that and friends

38:04.660 --> 38:11.760
Don't discuss money. I think I probably want you to say a more accurate total of how much money honey save you sometimes

38:11.780 --> 38:14.060
I will tell honey no

38:14.060 --> 38:19.020
I don't want to say that because I don't want the feeling of paying less than retail right

38:19.020 --> 38:26.060
This is my problem with honey the one problem. I have with honey is I'd prefer to pay for retail, so I know I'm getting the full

38:26.060 --> 38:30.380
experience right okay, if you're not like me though

especially when things are slow in the world of fast food and

42:48.400 --> 42:50.400

43:20.080 --> 43:25.720
I know this is the closest when they had Griffin. I'm sorry. I know you'd like to get a little cheese

43:25.720 --> 43:31.040
But let's talk about this. Let's talk about the spirit of Christian spirit of a vampire sexual. Oh, no. Oh my god

Welcome to my auction

Thank you for looking

43:42.360 --> 43:44.360
Christian is

43:44.440 --> 43:46.960
Very unusual to me. Oh boy

43:46.960 --> 43:51.040
There is a definitely us vampire

43:52.080 --> 43:54.800
sexual energy coming for my boy

44:01.060 --> 44:06.640
When you feel hot breath coming from the back of your coming from the back of mine

44:10.000 --> 44:14.200
Coming from the back of your honey, could you look at this because I'm not a doctor but

44:14.200 --> 44:16.200
This shouldn't be going that way

44:16.520 --> 44:19.320
Billowing around back there and I'm like what the fuck

44:20.480 --> 44:26.400
When you feel hot breath coming from the back of your neck, he is present boy

44:27.160 --> 44:28.320
the

44:28.320 --> 44:30.320
Apparition of him is magnificent

44:30.320 --> 44:44.140
I heard the words god, it's a it's such like a

44:44.680 --> 44:50.440
Sometimes you read one of these and a line like that. It's like that's a really powerful combo of words

44:50.440 --> 44:56.500
Whatever it took to get here. I'm glad we did, you know, the apparition of him is magnificent

44:56.500 --> 45:02.380
He will manifest himself in your dreams and try to cover himself over

45:04.180 --> 45:07.540
God a lot of challenging images and ideas

45:07.540 --> 45:12.680
Yeah, and it's not even really that they're not so much of blood and gore in there

45:12.680 --> 45:15.740
It's kind of a psychological horror with a grammatical

45:15.740 --> 45:15.980
Yeah

45:15.980 --> 45:23.280
Try he will try to cover himself confer himself over you ask him anything you want with a pendulum

45:23.280 --> 45:29.800
but don't be surprised if every response turns back to sex Wow

45:30.920 --> 45:33.900
Pinchelum though. I can't be surprised by that

45:34.920 --> 45:39.640
What how what options are you offering the pendulum that you're letting it do that?

45:40.360 --> 45:42.360
You know every

45:42.360 --> 45:44.360
Again

45:51.200 --> 45:53.780
Yeah, it's like a powerful lord with a little

45:59.280 --> 46:01.280
Apparitions truly wonderful

46:02.400 --> 46:06.980
Those eyebrows could use a little work. Don't be surprised if every response comes back to sex

46:06.980 --> 46:12.660
he wants to tell you about all his desires and pleasures if

46:13.940 --> 46:18.220
Communicating with him becomes dull in his opinion. He will stop responding

46:19.460 --> 46:21.620
He only becomes graphic in your dreams

46:29.060 --> 46:34.700
I start talking about like my interests and the things that I care about my family. He's like

46:34.700 --> 46:39.900
You're a family. What do I care of this? I'll see you to what that dick do

46:40.940 --> 46:42.940
Well, tell me about the dunger

46:43.380 --> 46:47.500
J-brand or get to the hints and I just want to point out that so far

46:47.540 --> 46:53.740
Then it just passively mentioned he's a vampire and then the rest of it is just about how wicked horny

46:54.580 --> 46:56.580
They're kind of burying the lead

46:56.580 --> 47:04.340
Is it possible? I'm glad he's horny. Don't get me wrong. Is it possible? The vampire thing is just assumed to from the horniness

47:05.100 --> 47:10.580
This guy's got vampire levels of horny. If he's not a vampire, something's off

47:15.780 --> 47:21.260
He's either a vampire or profoundly broken in a way that is unnerving

47:21.260 --> 47:25.420
Okay, he only becomes a graphic in your dreams

47:26.220 --> 47:32.620
He is not a demon and will not hurt you. He is only interested in sexual energy

47:32.620 --> 47:34.980
