00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.840
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern

00:47.840 --> 00:52.880
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.880 --> 00:56.080
I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30, Griffin McElroy.

00:56.080 --> 01:04.480
It's coming in hot, folks. I'm sure you've seen it blowing up the TVs and your mobile devices.

01:04.480 --> 01:11.360
It's finally almost here. So close now. Thor Ragnarok. This is a Thor Ragnarok watch. Just

01:11.360 --> 01:17.680
checking the buzz. Checking out all the buzz around Thor Ragnarok. Finger on the pulse of

01:17.680 --> 01:23.200
this hot body of Thor. Now, boys, I'm so excited to talk about this because I got to see a special

01:23.200 --> 01:29.280
preview screener two days ago. Oh, great. How's my huge friend doing, Thor?

01:29.280 --> 01:34.560
Well, he's doing good. And let me tell you, I can give... Okay, leaning close. Here are some

01:34.560 --> 01:41.600
special insights I can give you. One, he's dreamy. Two, he's creamy.

01:41.600 --> 01:46.880
He's creamy. They have really leaned into Thor, the bro-iest Avenger.

01:46.880 --> 01:50.640
Yeah, absolutely. In a good way. In a good, good way.

01:50.640 --> 01:54.640
Okay. I will also say that as I watched the movie

01:54.640 --> 02:00.560
of the preview screener, I mean, I liked to imagine that there would be someone who would

02:00.560 --> 02:06.720
go to see this movie who knew nothing about the Marvel Cinematic Universe and had never read a

02:06.720 --> 02:11.760
comic book before in their life and maybe didn't even know anything about Norse mythology trying

02:11.760 --> 02:18.960
to make either heads or tails of this movie. And it made me very happy because of how often the

02:18.960 --> 02:22.480
sentence, now who's this beefy fellow, would pop up in their heads.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.040
Now... Just a lot of beefy boys.

02:25.040 --> 02:26.720
How many beefy friends? A lot of beefy boys.

02:26.720 --> 02:28.640
How many beefy friends? Give me an exact number.

02:29.360 --> 02:36.320
I would say, Griffin, all the hamburger buns are empty because all the beef is in this movie.

02:37.120 --> 02:38.080
Wow. Now, I...

02:38.880 --> 02:40.960
That's not a number. Twelve?

02:40.960 --> 02:47.760
Okay, okay, okay. Now, we're just a few days... This came out on November 3rd,

02:47.760 --> 02:50.640
so we're getting close to release here on December 4th.

02:51.440 --> 02:55.920
American release. It came out in, I believe, Japan November 3rd.

02:56.480 --> 03:01.280
Yes, they love the huge man, Thor, and all of his much smaller friends,

03:01.280 --> 03:02.960
except for the green one who can sometimes get bigger.

03:02.960 --> 03:06.400
Green buddy. It's large man Thor and green buddy.

03:06.400 --> 03:09.200
And my green friend, the Hulk, or Bruce.

03:09.840 --> 03:15.120
I saw that Bruce is in the film and I heard that there's a scene where he says,

03:15.120 --> 03:19.440
why do we need... Thor says, why do we need the strong man here?

03:19.440 --> 03:22.560
I am strong. We do not need two of the strong men.

03:23.120 --> 03:26.800
Bring me someone who can fly, or perhaps a laser boy.

03:26.800 --> 03:30.960
And they... Thor doesn't understand why there needs another strong man.

03:30.960 --> 03:34.480
And let's talk about Avengers composition. Let's talk about it team comp.

03:35.120 --> 03:38.560
In terms of tank, DPS, healer, right?

03:38.560 --> 03:42.160
There's just like... There's vision, right? You can go through walls. That's fun.

03:42.160 --> 03:45.280
Hawkeye shoots a bow and arrow and sometimes says really sexist stuff.

03:45.280 --> 03:51.360
And then there's Black Widow who does all kinds of flips and spins.

03:51.360 --> 03:53.680
And then we have like... And Iron Man's got beams.

03:53.680 --> 03:58.240
And then there's like four strong men. It's like, do we need four?

03:58.240 --> 04:02.000
Just what do you do? Strong. I do strong-ness.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.880
Now Trav, tell me about the scene. I heard there's a scene where Thor says,

04:06.880 --> 04:12.800
um, you may be strong Hulk, Bruce, but I have this hammer.

04:12.800 --> 04:16.640
And then Hulk takes the hammer and Thor says, I'm no longer needed.

04:16.640 --> 04:20.080
And I will step away. And then he retires.

04:20.080 --> 04:23.040
Yeah. And you know, that comes five minutes into the movie.

04:23.600 --> 04:24.560
Wow. Yeah.

04:24.560 --> 04:28.080
And then the rest of the movie is Hulk as Thor.

04:28.080 --> 04:31.360
And they keep calling him Thulk, which is cute. I like that.

04:31.360 --> 04:36.720
And it keeps cutting back to Thor, like, you know, at the supermarket,

04:36.720 --> 04:40.400
or like, uh, he gets married, has a kid, serves on the PTA.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.640
Is the sun big and green?

04:43.280 --> 04:46.240
No, the sun is actually kind of a nerdy puny guy.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.840
So like Thor has to deal with that.

04:48.560 --> 04:52.560
Now, now the weird... I heard another scene that I saw.

04:52.560 --> 04:57.200
Now this was on a Fandango bonus clip that I got for pre-ordering tickets

04:57.200 --> 04:58.720
for this movie that opened a month ago.

04:58.720 --> 05:01.680
Uh-huh. And in it, in this bonus clip,

05:01.680 --> 05:07.200
after Thor raises a family, Hulk comes to his house and says,

05:07.200 --> 05:10.000
I am stronger than you. I will teach the children to be strong.

05:10.000 --> 05:10.960
I'm the father now.

05:10.960 --> 05:12.720
And he becomes... And Thor says, you're right.

05:12.720 --> 05:15.280
Yeah. And Hulk becomes Thor's kids' dads.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.280
Is that in the final cut? Did that one get bragged and cut?

05:17.280 --> 05:20.000
Absolutely. That's actually, Justin, I'm glad you brought that up

05:20.000 --> 05:25.200
because that's actually a post-credits scene that dovetails with Daddy's Home 2.

05:25.200 --> 05:29.440
Oh, good. I was hoping we could talk about that picture in the podcast.

05:29.440 --> 05:32.960
Yeah, so then it's all in the Daddy's Home multiverse.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.560
And that's when Samuel L. Jackson shows up and says,

05:36.560 --> 05:38.480
I'm putting together a team of step-dads.

05:39.120 --> 05:45.200
Yeah. I like the scene in Daddy's Home 2 where the Hulk comes and crushes,

05:45.200 --> 05:49.520
then eats just all the men in that picture.

05:49.520 --> 05:54.160
And then they're gone in real life, which is really cool and fun.

05:54.160 --> 05:55.840
And great.

05:56.400 --> 06:01.280
Now, does Thor Ragnarok include the scene where John Lithgow

06:01.280 --> 06:04.160
shows up on the first day of Daddy's Home 2 filming

06:04.160 --> 06:07.520
and sees that the other new daddy is Mel Gibson?

06:07.520 --> 06:11.520
And there's 15 minutes of him just like, are we sure?

06:11.520 --> 06:14.480
Are you sure about that? Are you sure about this one?

06:14.480 --> 06:20.640
I actually also got a preview screener of Daddy's Home 2 and without the CGI.

06:20.640 --> 06:24.080
And what they haven't released yet, maybe this is like a special bonus thing,

06:24.080 --> 06:26.160
but John Lithgow is not in the movie.

06:26.160 --> 06:28.480
It's all Andy Serkis motion capture.

06:28.480 --> 06:33.040
Yeah, cause John Lithgow walked over and saw the comedy duo,

06:33.040 --> 06:37.120
the hysterical duo of Mark Wahlberg and Mel Gibson they put together.

06:37.120 --> 06:41.280
And he literally, he just, he pulled out his grappling hook and ziplined away.

06:41.280 --> 06:44.560
But Andy Serkis stepped in and he was like, I have no problem with these two.

06:44.560 --> 06:47.600
So Andy Serkis is doing, is John Lithgow.

06:47.600 --> 06:48.800
Loves Mel Gibson.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.560
They've already paid him.

06:50.560 --> 06:58.640
Yeah, now I heard there's a scene in Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri,

06:58.640 --> 07:01.920
where the Hulk comes and takes the three billboards

07:01.920 --> 07:05.120
and says, now there's no more need for your movie.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.640
I will take these to mine.

07:06.640 --> 07:09.280
And so France makes Dormant, it's like, well, I retire.

07:10.480 --> 07:11.760
Well, actually what happens is-

07:11.760 --> 07:15.040
The billboards are gone in her movie, so she closes her movie

07:15.040 --> 07:20.160
and Hulk puts the three billboards into Hulk Ragnarok, a Thor picture.

07:20.160 --> 07:22.480
You must've seen a previous version.

07:22.480 --> 07:25.760
Maybe that was like 1.0 because in the version I saw,

07:26.400 --> 07:31.120
Thor goes to grab the billboards and Frances McDormand says no.

07:31.120 --> 07:33.520
And Hulk goes, well, I bow to your wisdom.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.400
Thank you so much for everything you've done.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.520
You're amazing.

07:37.520 --> 07:41.200
And then she kills and eats Hulk and becomes Hulk.

07:41.200 --> 07:41.440
Yes.

07:42.320 --> 07:43.520
Now I heard there's-

07:44.160 --> 07:45.200
Justin heard about it.

07:45.200 --> 07:47.040
Justin's just seen all the scenes.

07:47.040 --> 07:49.280
And so let's just sit back and watch him do his thing.

07:49.280 --> 07:51.440
It's almost a spoiler.

07:51.440 --> 07:54.480
At this, I feel like so much has been spoiled,

07:54.480 --> 07:58.320
but I heard that Hulk does jump into the Orient Express

07:58.320 --> 08:01.280
and says, I have the final solution.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.880
The butler conducted the crime.

08:03.440 --> 08:05.920
And Poro's like, there's no butler.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.600
And Hulk's like, ah, ah, ah, ah.

08:07.600 --> 08:10.000
I said the butler committed the crime.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.560
You may put your train back into the station.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.080
Your film is no longer needed.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.560
And then he eats the whole train.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.800
He does eat the whole train.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.720
Which is also how Snowpiercer ended,

08:20.720 --> 08:23.360
with just the train starts up again

08:23.360 --> 08:26.240
and then it goes right into Hulk's big mouth and open belly.

08:26.240 --> 08:26.480
Yep.

08:27.360 --> 08:28.240
That's all accurate.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.040
That all happens.

08:29.040 --> 08:32.160
It's the scene in the movie where Hulk finally gets his reward

08:32.160 --> 08:34.720
of getting a Coca-Cola and then the Ant-Man shows up

08:34.720 --> 08:38.080
and steals his fucking Coca-Cola, that piece of shit Ant-Man.

08:39.040 --> 08:43.440
There's also a prolonged scene in which Hulk walks around naked

08:43.440 --> 08:44.960
and I wish this was a joke.

08:44.960 --> 08:49.120
And it makes me, for the first time-

08:49.120 --> 08:49.920
Erect.

08:49.920 --> 08:50.480
Erect.

08:51.840 --> 08:55.440
It forces me to think about Hulk's genitalia in a way that I-

08:55.440 --> 08:57.120
The first time, bud.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.760
The first time, bud.

08:59.760 --> 09:02.240
As if the first time fucking Stanley was like,

09:02.240 --> 09:05.200
ah, Eureka, my catchphrase, I've got it.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.720
The man turns big and green.

09:06.720 --> 09:10.080
And instantly we heard that conceit and we're like, dick too though, right?

09:10.080 --> 09:10.560
Stanley?

09:10.560 --> 09:12.720
No, actually I have concrete proof.

09:12.720 --> 09:17.040
So, okay, the Hulk, Bruce Banner transforms into the Hulk.

09:17.040 --> 09:18.800
Imagine the classic image.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.360
What you see is pants that have been torn,

09:21.360 --> 09:26.160
usually from the mid thigh to knee down, right?

09:26.160 --> 09:30.720
But after the transformation into Hulk and back into Bruce Banner,

09:30.720 --> 09:32.000
those pants have been torn.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.120
The crotch of the pants is never destroyed.

09:35.120 --> 09:39.120
So we have to assume that Hulk gets huge muscles,

09:39.120 --> 09:41.760
but like just a regular human penis.

09:41.760 --> 09:44.560
But Bruce's penis is probably pretty good.

09:44.560 --> 09:45.600
Bruce's penis.

09:45.600 --> 09:50.640
I mean, he's already had pants sized to his penis that the Hulk does not destroy.

09:50.640 --> 09:52.800
Actually, when he's Bruce, he has the Hulk's penis.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.240
And when he's the Hulk, he has Bruce's penis.

09:54.240 --> 09:57.600
It's a weird sort of mix around.

09:59.360 --> 10:02.480
Now, I heard that there's, I saw one more deleted scene

10:03.440 --> 10:07.120
where the Hulk goes into Lady Bird and says,

10:07.120 --> 10:10.800
I'm not aware of what this film is or is about,

10:10.800 --> 10:13.440
but I've heard good things, so I'll take it for my own.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.800
And then he goes into the shape of water and is like,

10:16.800 --> 10:18.880
I don't know, teardrops, lakes, and ocean.

10:18.880 --> 10:20.960
Anyway, your movie is over too.

10:20.960 --> 10:22.960
And the Hulk takes all the water.

10:22.960 --> 10:27.200
So what you're suggesting, Justin, is that what you've seen

10:27.200 --> 10:30.400
is a cut of the movie that is a very like last action hero.

10:31.280 --> 10:32.800
Hulk is a film walker.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.840
He just claims movies as his own.

10:36.480 --> 10:38.320
Now, I did sweet a lot of this.

10:38.320 --> 10:43.040
So a lot of this is sort of sweeted stuff from my own studio

10:44.640 --> 10:45.280
here at the house.

10:45.280 --> 10:48.480
I saw a scene in A Bad Mom's Christmas that,

10:49.040 --> 10:51.760
and the Ant-Man, and by scene, I mean the whole movie.

10:51.760 --> 10:52.720
Ant-Man's in the whole thing.

10:52.720 --> 10:53.360
You just can't see him.

10:53.360 --> 10:54.080
He's really small.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.880
He's like a speck of dust just floating around,

10:56.880 --> 10:59.600
landing on Mila Kunis' nose, but you don't see him.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.840
But if you turn up the audio like all the way,

11:01.840 --> 11:03.280
like blow out your speakers,

11:03.280 --> 11:05.200
you can hear Paul Rudd doing his comedy.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.520
Oh, that's fun.

11:07.520 --> 11:09.280
Yeah, he's in most movies the whole time,

11:09.280 --> 11:12.240
just very small and you can't tell, but he's very small.

11:12.240 --> 11:15.600
To be fair though, Paul Rudd is just in most movies.

11:15.600 --> 11:16.400
That's true.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.880
And it's very confusing because he's also in it as Ant-Man.

11:19.440 --> 11:20.080
Yeah.

11:20.080 --> 11:23.440
Well, that's the thing is he's always been Ant-Man in movies.

11:23.440 --> 11:26.480
It's just like pre getting the suit and post getting the suit.

11:26.480 --> 11:27.040
Sure.

11:27.040 --> 11:30.640
Hey, questions time because half of the show will be a special thing

11:30.640 --> 11:33.360
and I would love to get at least some of our good work into it.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.320
Okay, before we do, before we do,

11:36.320 --> 11:39.360
if you're listening to this on Monday, tonight,

11:39.360 --> 11:43.360
I am participating in a World Builders,

11:43.360 --> 11:46.400
which is a charity organization spearheaded by Pat Rothfuss,

11:46.400 --> 11:48.480
a StarCraft tournament.

11:48.480 --> 11:50.560
Oh my God, are you playing StarCraft?

11:50.560 --> 11:51.280
I am.

11:51.280 --> 11:52.800
Have you ever played StarCraft?

11:52.800 --> 11:53.600
I have not.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.360
This should be good, bro.

11:55.360 --> 11:56.560
What's your APMs?

11:56.560 --> 12:04.000
Oh God, it's me and Tybee playing as a team run fan cast

12:04.000 --> 12:08.720
with absolutely positively no idea what we're doing,

12:08.720 --> 12:10.320
but it's for a good cause.

12:10.320 --> 12:14.240
You can go to bit.ly forward slash run WB

12:15.760 --> 12:20.080
and help donate money to sponsor our team.

12:20.080 --> 12:22.880
I can't, you know I'm gonna be there watching you fuck up

12:22.880 --> 12:25.520
at like building too many pylons or whatever.

12:25.520 --> 12:27.600
Oh, Griffin, it's gonna be terrible.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.920
Like, listen, it's gonna be fun.

12:30.560 --> 12:31.360
I'm gonna be terrible.

12:31.360 --> 12:31.840
Let me be clear.

12:31.840 --> 12:33.200
Have you not watched any videos?

12:33.200 --> 12:34.480
Have you not watched any videos or whatever

12:34.480 --> 12:35.120
on how to StarCraft?

12:35.120 --> 12:36.240
I mean, I will.

12:36.240 --> 12:37.120
Okay.

12:37.120 --> 12:38.640
I'm sure I will.

12:38.640 --> 12:43.760
And I believe that happens tonight at 10.30 central time

12:44.720 --> 12:45.680
is when I'm playing.

12:46.320 --> 12:47.520
There's lots of other people playing.

12:47.520 --> 12:48.800
The double clicks are playing.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.160
Paul and Storm are playing.

12:51.680 --> 12:54.560
Mikey Newman is playing.

12:54.560 --> 12:55.200
Lots of people are playing.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.960
I hear Mikey's got sick APM,

12:56.960 --> 12:58.320
so you're gonna get put in the trash can.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.400
Oh no, he is gonna just kick my ass.

13:01.360 --> 13:02.560
No doubt, no doubt.

13:02.560 --> 13:07.040
But check that out and run bit.ly forward slash run WB

13:07.040 --> 13:08.400
to help sponsor that.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.040
And Justin, tell us about NBNB AM Angels

13:11.040 --> 13:11.840
before we kick off these questions.

13:11.840 --> 13:14.000
Yeah, before we get in the show,

13:14.000 --> 13:18.240
NBNB AM Angels is an annual project

13:18.240 --> 13:21.520
that we sort of like tangentially do

13:21.520 --> 13:23.040
just because it's like us,

13:23.040 --> 13:25.280
but really we don't do any of the heavy lifting.

13:25.280 --> 13:26.720
We have a great team of people

13:26.720 --> 13:29.200
that are like doing this hard work.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.920
But we have a lot of people in the area that we grew up

13:31.920 --> 13:33.760
and where I still live here in Huntington

13:33.760 --> 13:35.200
and the surrounding Tri-State area

13:35.200 --> 13:38.160
who have a lot of needs for this holiday season.

13:38.160 --> 13:39.840
And there are a lot of people

13:39.840 --> 13:41.520
who aren't gonna have anything

13:41.520 --> 13:44.560
for this blessed Candle Nights season.

13:44.560 --> 13:48.160
And we're not talking about like fun toys usually.

13:48.160 --> 13:52.480
We're talking about stuff like a wheelchair is needed

13:52.480 --> 13:54.080
and a gas car to get to work

13:54.080 --> 13:57.040
and a bed and a tent and things like this,

13:57.040 --> 13:59.280
just things that people really need.

13:59.280 --> 14:02.240
And you can be a hero this Candle Nights season

14:02.240 --> 14:07.120
and help fix these problems.

14:07.120 --> 14:08.720
I mean, like it's heartbreaking.

14:08.720 --> 14:11.360
And if you go to NBNBAMangels.com,

14:11.360 --> 14:12.880
you're gonna see a ton of opportunities

14:12.880 --> 14:14.000
where you can help.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.120
It's easy to do.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.480
There's a great team of people

14:16.480 --> 14:20.400
who are ready to assist you.

14:20.400 --> 14:23.120
And even if you're just gonna kick in a few bucks,

14:23.120 --> 14:25.840
you don't have to buy one of these items specifically.

14:25.840 --> 14:27.040
But it's a wonderful project

14:27.040 --> 14:29.600
that we care a lot about.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.160
So if you can find it in your heart to help out,

14:32.160 --> 14:35.920
NBNBAMangels.com and you can find someone to help.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.360
And if you do, please tweet at us.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.120
Let us know so we can thank you personally.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.960
And we really appreciate anything you can do

14:42.960 --> 14:44.560
to assist with that.

14:44.560 --> 14:48.240
Real quick, I misspoke that the StarCraft Tournament,

14:48.240 --> 14:53.040
I will be playing at 9.30 Central, 10.30 Eastern PM tonight.

14:53.040 --> 14:57.760
The tournament kicks off at 8 PM Central time.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.200
And you can find out all the information

14:59.200 --> 15:02.000
at worldbuilders.org slash StarCraft.

15:03.120 --> 15:04.080
All right, first question.

15:04.080 --> 15:05.360
I tend to lounge around the house

15:05.360 --> 15:07.920
in a luxurious plaid bathrobe,

15:07.920 --> 15:10.640
almost always with a t-shirt and shorts under it.

15:10.640 --> 15:17.040
Sometimes when I want candy, I will go to the convenience store

15:17.040 --> 15:19.200
across the street without putting on real clothes.

15:19.200 --> 15:22.000
This is legitimate because it's really close to where I live.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.320
Well, now I want a bagel, but I don't want to change.

15:26.320 --> 15:28.720
But the bagel place is like a half mile away.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.720
Is that too far for the bathrobe?

15:30.720 --> 15:32.960
Well, people think I'm just a weirdo.

15:32.960 --> 15:34.400
That's from the robed one.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.000
There's so much going on.

15:36.640 --> 15:39.600
You are making assumptions left and right.

15:41.520 --> 15:45.680
You just, here's the thing about the bathrobe look.

15:45.680 --> 15:50.240
I mean, I support you and you walk your path.

15:50.240 --> 15:53.840
I'm not trying to shame anyone's bathrobe usage,

15:53.840 --> 15:56.560
except that I am about to do just that.

15:56.560 --> 16:00.320
But there's not a bubble extending from your house

16:00.880 --> 16:03.840
where the bathrobe is acceptable.

16:03.840 --> 16:05.360
The bubble is the house.

16:05.360 --> 16:06.000
The bubble's the house.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.200
It's literally maybe where your paper lands.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.920
Unless I just don't know.

16:11.920 --> 16:14.880
It's as far as your Wi-Fi extends from your house.

16:14.880 --> 16:17.280
If you got the Wi-Fi signal, you can pull out your phone

16:17.280 --> 16:18.560
and say like, no, no, no, it's cool.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.000
See, Robbie's place.

16:20.000 --> 16:20.480
You see that?

16:21.680 --> 16:23.280
Don't try to hack Robbie's place.

16:23.280 --> 16:24.240
It's iron clad.

16:24.800 --> 16:27.680
If you still have Wi-Fi, you can Arthur Dent all over town.

16:28.240 --> 16:32.240
You can set up repeaters down the block and just,

16:32.240 --> 16:34.880
but okay, listen, you can't just say,

16:34.880 --> 16:36.720
listen, question asker, I love you.

16:36.720 --> 16:37.520
You know that, right?

16:37.520 --> 16:38.320
I love you.

16:38.320 --> 16:40.880
You can't just say, this is legitimate

16:40.880 --> 16:42.400
because it's really close.

16:42.400 --> 16:43.920
You don't get to make that call.

16:44.480 --> 16:47.040
Yeah, it's legitimate because I really wanted candy.

16:47.040 --> 16:50.240
And now I'm in the bathroom.

16:50.240 --> 16:52.080
Now I will say that bagel place,

16:52.080 --> 16:54.480
I feel like is more appropriate for the bathrobe

16:54.480 --> 16:56.720
because it's a breakfast time thing.

16:56.720 --> 16:59.440
And so you can show up and you say like, oops,

16:59.440 --> 17:01.920
Monday's breakfast time, bagel, please.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.520
I'm not naked under this.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.840
And that's so, you've got to say the last part.

17:05.840 --> 17:09.360
The highest level of maturity is being able to see the world

17:09.360 --> 17:11.280
through the point of view of other people.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.040
And you have to understand that when you go

17:13.040 --> 17:16.320
to the convenience store, see it through their eyes,

17:16.320 --> 17:18.880
they don't look at each other after you leave and say,

17:18.880 --> 17:20.720
it's cool, he lives nearby.

17:21.280 --> 17:24.400
That's not, that dialogue does not take place.

17:24.400 --> 17:27.600
Is it okay to go out of doors, dress in an outfit

17:27.600 --> 17:28.720
with a robe over it?

17:28.720 --> 17:30.560
I assume shoes, please wear shoes.

17:31.360 --> 17:35.520
Yeah, I mean, legally, legally speaking, sure.

17:35.520 --> 17:38.720
Are you saying, will people maybe give me a little side eye?

17:38.720 --> 17:39.760
Absolutely.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.040
Absolutely they will.

17:41.040 --> 17:41.680
Unless.

17:42.480 --> 17:43.200
Unless?

17:43.200 --> 17:43.840
Unless?

17:43.840 --> 17:46.880
In one question, unless.

17:46.880 --> 17:49.680
If you're gonna leave the house, you silly goose,

17:50.720 --> 17:52.640
just tuck the robe into the shorts.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.480
And then at the worst, people are just gonna think

17:54.480 --> 17:56.160
you got a super lumpy duff.

17:56.800 --> 17:57.440
And that's it.

17:58.960 --> 18:02.000
They're just wearing a coat and their shorts are holding in.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.360
They're very, very lumpy duff.

18:03.920 --> 18:06.800
Would this be different if instead of like a luxurious

18:06.800 --> 18:10.320
plaid bathrobe, you were wearing like an embroidered

18:10.320 --> 18:11.760
like boxer's robe?

18:11.760 --> 18:16.400
Oh, and then people might think you're a champion boxer.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.800
Oh, he needs those Mike and Ikes to carve up

18:18.800 --> 18:19.600
before the big fight.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.120
Before the big fight today.

18:21.120 --> 18:23.840
It's gonna be hard for me to see that and not assume

18:23.840 --> 18:26.480
that you're putting it through heavy usage

18:26.480 --> 18:29.440
and then start thinking about the scent,

18:29.440 --> 18:31.840
the scent of it, because you know what I'm talking about.

18:31.840 --> 18:35.760
A robe that gets heavy usage, it's got all your smell in it.

18:35.760 --> 18:38.080
And I don't want to even look at the smell

18:38.080 --> 18:40.080
because I can feel it and taste it.

18:40.080 --> 18:42.800
Again, if you want to wear a robe, go for it,

18:42.800 --> 18:47.200
but please stop creating justifications for yourself.

18:47.840 --> 18:50.800
You're a guy wearing a robe or a gal wearing a robe

18:50.800 --> 18:51.920
or a person wearing a robe.

18:51.920 --> 18:55.280
I don't know, but you're still wearing a robe

18:55.280 --> 18:56.400
outside of your house.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.440
It doesn't matter how far you're from your home.

18:57.440 --> 18:58.400
It's a wild tactic.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.200
How about this Yahoo?

18:59.200 --> 19:00.880
It was sent in by the delivery man, Seth Carlson.

19:00.880 --> 19:01.520
Thank you, Seth.

19:01.520 --> 19:03.200
It's from Yahoo Answers user.

19:04.160 --> 19:07.440
Jotun Hurtigen asks,

19:07.440 --> 19:12.640
what happens if a vampire bites another vampire?

19:14.400 --> 19:16.000
I'm, can I tell you?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.640
I'm so glad that this question is included.

19:18.640 --> 19:20.320
It's long overdue.

19:20.320 --> 19:23.600
And listen, we'll circle back to this super vampire steak,

19:23.600 --> 19:25.440
but I was thinking about this.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.840
People like to throw a lot of shit at vampires

19:27.840 --> 19:30.480
and I bet you, I bet you, Griffin,

19:30.480 --> 19:33.760
a lot of those people that are hurling shit at vampires

19:33.760 --> 19:35.280
also eat steaks.

19:35.280 --> 19:36.880
Vampires gotta eat.

19:36.880 --> 19:37.760
That's what I'm saying.

19:38.320 --> 19:40.240
This has gone on for too long.

19:40.240 --> 19:42.400
What, a vampire, so we kill him?

19:42.400 --> 19:44.160
People are cattle.

19:44.160 --> 19:45.680
To a vampire?

19:45.680 --> 19:46.640
Yeah, no, I know.

19:47.360 --> 19:48.560
But you still sort of,

19:48.560 --> 19:50.720
you still definitely said it with your whole mouth.

19:51.280 --> 19:52.240
To a vampire?

19:52.240 --> 19:53.680
Yeah, that's how, listen,

19:53.680 --> 19:56.400
it's the circle of life.

19:56.400 --> 19:58.080
No, I will not, no.

19:58.080 --> 20:00.400
It's sort of a straight line of light.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.440
It's like a life pyramid.

20:01.440 --> 20:03.840
Well, but then bacteria eat vampires, so.

20:04.560 --> 20:05.680
Yeah, I guess it all keeps,

20:05.680 --> 20:06.960
the big wheel keeps spinning.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.320
Oh, no, wait, the sun eats vampires

20:10.320 --> 20:11.760
and then plants eat the sun.

20:11.760 --> 20:13.520
There we go, so when you're eating,

20:13.520 --> 20:15.040
if you're eating a cucumber,

20:15.040 --> 20:17.360
then you're just eating vampire, basically.

20:17.360 --> 20:20.880
Yeah, basically, it's the circle of life.

20:20.880 --> 20:22.800
The sun is powered by vampire energy

20:23.360 --> 20:24.880
from vampires they've consumed.

20:24.880 --> 20:25.680
We all know that.

20:25.680 --> 20:27.520
That's why global warming is such an issue.

20:27.520 --> 20:28.320
Too many vamps.

20:30.560 --> 20:31.520
Two things, I think.

20:31.520 --> 20:33.520
If a vampire bites another vampire,

20:33.520 --> 20:35.280
one double vampire

20:35.280 --> 20:36.800
and these are the scariest of all.

20:37.600 --> 20:38.560
Can you even,

20:38.560 --> 20:40.800
if a double vampire bites a double vampire,

20:40.800 --> 20:43.200
is it a triple vampire or do we square root it?

20:43.200 --> 20:45.120
What are some of the key differentiators,

20:45.120 --> 20:46.480
Griffin, of a double vampire?

20:46.480 --> 20:47.600
Four fangs, four fangs.

20:49.280 --> 20:51.600
Four big fangs and the accent gets like,

20:51.600 --> 20:54.160
if a regular vampire is here,

20:54.160 --> 20:57.600
a double vampire is like here.

20:57.600 --> 21:02.000
And the quadruple vampire is here.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.560
Now, if I was a quintuple vampire,

21:04.560 --> 21:05.760
exactly what would that sound like?

21:05.760 --> 21:13.280
A quintuple vampire and an octuple vampire is here.

21:13.280 --> 21:16.960
I want to suck your blood, donkey.

21:22.560 --> 21:25.600
Are you suggesting Shrek was an octuple vampire?

21:26.240 --> 21:28.800
Yeah, I think Shrek is an octuple vampire, for sure.

21:28.800 --> 21:29.600
That makes sense.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.280
He was a vampire that bit another vampire

21:31.280 --> 21:32.560
and then bit a double vampire

21:32.560 --> 21:35.520
and then bit a quadruple vampire.

21:35.520 --> 21:36.720
Okay, so this is my question.

21:37.360 --> 21:38.640
The vampire that doubles,

21:39.200 --> 21:42.560
is it the vampire that bites or the vampire that is bit?

21:42.560 --> 21:44.800
Ooh, I think it's a vampire that is bit.

21:44.800 --> 21:45.920
That's a good point, Travis.

21:45.920 --> 21:47.920
Oh, see, I was gonna say the vampire that bites.

21:48.720 --> 21:51.920
No, because that's not how the vampiric process works.

21:51.920 --> 21:52.800
I guess that's true.

21:52.800 --> 21:54.720
I was thinking, I guess more of like

21:54.720 --> 21:57.840
the double vampire siphons the vampire away

21:57.840 --> 22:00.400
and then that vampire is like, well, you're normal again.

22:00.400 --> 22:04.000
No, the vampire bites another vampire,

22:04.000 --> 22:06.400
transforming the bitten vampire into a double vampire,

22:06.400 --> 22:08.320
and then the new double vampire turns around

22:08.320 --> 22:09.520
and is like, now you fucked up.

22:10.160 --> 22:11.040
Now you fucked up.

22:11.040 --> 22:12.000
Look at these fangs.

22:12.000 --> 22:12.880
You're in trouble now.

22:12.880 --> 22:16.160
Is it a triple vampire or is it like squared every time?

22:16.160 --> 22:19.200
I think we go up by the root of two.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.200
Now, that's the first scenario, a double vampire,

22:21.200 --> 22:22.560
and it is the correct scenario

22:22.560 --> 22:24.320
because it's such a good world that I want to live in.

22:24.320 --> 22:25.200
That one's science-based.

22:25.200 --> 22:25.920
That one's science-based.

22:25.920 --> 22:28.880
The other situation that could happen is it's just awkward.

22:28.880 --> 22:32.320
It's just like, look, look, look.

22:32.320 --> 22:33.920
Hey, dude, hey, dude, stop, stop, stop, stop.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.200
Look, check the fangs.

22:35.200 --> 22:36.000
One, two.

22:36.000 --> 22:36.880
Oh.

22:36.880 --> 22:38.080
Oh, yeah, yeah.

22:38.080 --> 22:39.120
Oh, man.

22:39.120 --> 22:40.000
Yeah, I'm a vampire.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.880
I hate the sun and garlic and love to bite.

22:42.880 --> 22:44.240
That's me too, so.

22:44.240 --> 22:45.440
They don't have blood, right?

22:45.440 --> 22:46.560
Vampires don't have blood.

22:46.560 --> 22:47.600
It's just dust in there, right?

22:47.600 --> 22:48.160
It's just dust.

22:48.160 --> 22:48.880
That's why they need to keep drinking it.

22:48.880 --> 22:50.400
Well, it depends if they've recently fed.

22:52.400 --> 22:54.720
I think the blood's only in their tummy at that point though.

22:54.720 --> 22:57.520
Do they, so do the vampires pee out blood?

22:57.520 --> 23:00.400
And if so, how do they know when they have prostate issues?

23:00.400 --> 23:01.360
I mean, you fit.

23:01.360 --> 23:04.320
As somebody who's had prostate issues before, you'll know.

23:04.960 --> 23:08.160
Do you think that with a vampire pees and it's not blood,

23:08.160 --> 23:09.040
they're like, oh, no.

23:09.600 --> 23:10.640
Oh, crap.

23:10.640 --> 23:11.360
Oh, it's wearing.

23:11.360 --> 23:12.320
Oh, never mind.

23:12.320 --> 23:13.440
Psych, I'm immortal.

23:13.440 --> 23:14.000
I forgot.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.960
Oh, wait, yeah, I don't have prostate issues.

23:16.960 --> 23:17.280
Fine.

23:17.920 --> 23:19.120
Double vampire.

23:19.120 --> 23:20.000
How about another question?

23:21.200 --> 23:23.440
Brothers, some local teens just knocked on our door

23:23.440 --> 23:27.520
and asked us to cook their unpopped microwave popcorn.

23:27.520 --> 23:29.520
I do not recognize these youths.

23:29.520 --> 23:31.360
Am I setting myself up for a long con

23:31.360 --> 23:32.880
by being a cool neighbor?

23:32.880 --> 23:35.440
That's from corny conundrum in Gooneyville.

23:35.440 --> 23:38.960
Yes, literally the town from Goonies, Astoria, Oregon.

23:38.960 --> 23:39.440
Fuck yeah.

23:40.160 --> 23:41.920
I mean, is it the Goonies that came to your house?

23:41.920 --> 23:43.600
Because maybe they got a treasure map.

23:43.600 --> 23:44.400
They want to steal it.

23:44.400 --> 23:45.840
Maybe there's treasures under your house

23:45.840 --> 23:47.840
and they would just want to go in your basement.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.120
I mean, they're adults now, though.

23:49.120 --> 23:50.480
So these would be adults like, hey,

23:50.480 --> 23:51.760
can we come in your basement?

23:51.760 --> 23:53.120
I bet you got a map.

23:53.120 --> 23:54.320
Here's some popcorn.

23:54.320 --> 23:55.360
I'm Sean Astin.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.000
This is what I sound like.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.440
I'm a septuple vampire.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.920
I didn't have an accent when I started.

24:04.560 --> 24:08.000
Why do they have a bag of microwave popcorn

24:08.000 --> 24:08.960
but no microwave?

24:08.960 --> 24:10.400
Why did they purchase?

24:10.400 --> 24:11.760
They robbed a Boy Scout.

24:11.760 --> 24:13.600
They might've robbed a Boy Scout.

24:13.600 --> 24:14.720
They might've robbed a Boy Scout

24:14.720 --> 24:16.560
who was selling popcorn door to door.

24:16.560 --> 24:16.960
Oh, no.

24:16.960 --> 24:19.680
I mean, I'm kind of into this Moonrise Kingdom,

24:19.680 --> 24:22.560
like a band of kids sitting out on their own,

24:22.560 --> 24:24.000
the only food they brought with them

24:24.000 --> 24:25.360
on their journey was popcorn,

24:25.360 --> 24:28.000
but they're kids, so they didn't think about it.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.560
And so they need you to pop the popcorn

24:30.560 --> 24:33.040
so they can eat something while they wander into the forest

24:33.040 --> 24:35.200
because one of them knows where a dead body is,

24:35.200 --> 24:36.480
just like in Moonrise Kingdom.

24:36.480 --> 24:39.920
Yeah, you know, I guess I assumed that these kids

24:39.920 --> 24:42.400
were like local next door kids,

24:42.400 --> 24:45.360
but these kids could have been on a long journey

24:47.040 --> 24:49.760
and maybe like the last thing they had in their packs

24:49.760 --> 24:50.960
was like microwave popcorn.

24:50.960 --> 24:52.000
You know what I mean?

24:52.000 --> 24:52.640
It's possible.

24:53.280 --> 24:56.640
Why not say yes, but then you have to stay on the porch

24:56.640 --> 24:58.560
and wait and you close the door

24:58.560 --> 25:00.000
and you pop their corn for them

25:00.880 --> 25:03.600
and then you return it and you send those scamps on their way,

25:03.600 --> 25:04.960
but don't let them in your house.

25:04.960 --> 25:07.680
Dear God, whatever you do, don't let them in your house.

25:07.680 --> 25:12.000
I think a good way to test their intentions

25:12.000 --> 25:14.320
is to say, yes, I will pop the popcorn,

25:15.120 --> 25:17.120
but you will enjoy this popcorn with me

25:17.760 --> 25:20.000
and we'll all enjoy this popcorn together

25:20.000 --> 25:23.680
here on the porch in just a communal manner

25:23.680 --> 25:25.760
and we'll all share the popcorn together.

25:25.760 --> 25:29.120
I need the 10% for the juice, for the vig.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.200
I'm gonna get my beak salty.

25:32.880 --> 25:34.720
They could be vamps, though, trying to get access

25:34.720 --> 25:35.440
to the gentleman's side.

25:35.440 --> 25:36.640
That's why you can't let them in the house.

25:36.640 --> 25:37.520
Can't let them in the house.

25:37.520 --> 25:38.640
Don't let the wrong one in.

25:40.880 --> 25:42.080
That's what the movie's called.

25:42.080 --> 25:43.680
I got a Yahoo here and I want to read it

25:44.240 --> 25:45.200
before we go to the Money Zone

25:45.200 --> 25:46.640
and move on to a very special segment

25:46.640 --> 25:48.960
because it features something so pure and so wonderful.

25:48.960 --> 25:50.640
It's another Seth Carlson jam.

25:50.640 --> 25:51.520
Thank you, Seth.

25:51.520 --> 25:52.560
It's Yahoo Answers user.

25:52.560 --> 25:54.160
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

25:54.160 --> 25:57.520
I'm gonna call him Broderick asks,

25:58.720 --> 26:01.120
NCIS-themed birthday party?

26:02.560 --> 26:05.600
I want to throw a really nice NCIS-themed birthday party,

26:05.600 --> 26:07.200
but aren't sure how to do it.

26:07.200 --> 26:08.800
I don't know what to do for a cake,

26:08.800 --> 26:10.480
decorations, games, anything like that.

26:10.480 --> 26:10.800
Thanks.

26:12.240 --> 26:15.360
Okay, before we get into the details of this.

26:15.360 --> 26:16.480
How much have we watched?

26:16.480 --> 26:18.400
Well, here's the thing.

26:18.400 --> 26:19.920
I love somebody saying,

26:19.920 --> 26:23.600
I want to throw specific theme birthday party here.

26:23.600 --> 26:24.800
I have no ideas.

26:24.800 --> 26:27.040
I have no ideas for it whatsoever.

26:27.040 --> 26:28.720
So like, do you then?

26:28.720 --> 26:30.320
Do you want to throw that party?

26:31.120 --> 26:32.800
Or do you just like NCIS?

26:33.520 --> 26:37.200
I very much like NCIS and I very much like aging

26:37.200 --> 26:39.040
and I want to combine those two activities.

26:41.360 --> 26:43.600
I think the only thing I know about NCIS,

26:43.600 --> 26:44.480
I know two things.

26:44.480 --> 26:48.160
One, the Secret Service agent from West Wing is in it.

26:49.120 --> 26:50.400
Correct, Mark Harmon.

26:50.400 --> 26:51.680
And there's some-

26:51.680 --> 26:54.080
Incredible hero, incredible hero, sorry.

26:54.720 --> 26:56.400
Incredible hero, Mark Harmon,

26:56.400 --> 26:58.240
that once saved a boy from a burning car.

26:58.240 --> 26:58.880
Mark Harmon.

26:58.880 --> 26:59.360
Wait, really?

26:59.360 --> 26:59.920
Yeah, Mark Harmon.

27:00.480 --> 27:01.440
Fuck yeah, dude.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.240
Mark Harmon saved a boy from a burning car?

27:05.040 --> 27:06.880
Yeah, Mark Harmon is a fucking hero.

27:06.880 --> 27:09.520
He pulled two kids out of a burning car.

27:09.520 --> 27:10.880
Well, now it's two kids?

27:10.880 --> 27:13.280
Hold on, this started as one kid.

27:13.280 --> 27:14.640
It started as one kid.

27:14.640 --> 27:17.200
He pulled six kids out of a burning bus.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.280
He ate a burning limousine.

27:19.280 --> 27:20.640
To save 12 kids.

27:21.200 --> 27:22.800
We've talked about this before, I believe,

27:22.800 --> 27:24.400
so I'm going to go through this quickly.

27:24.400 --> 27:30.240
But Mark Harmon was kicking it in LA, 1996, 715.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.960
These teens missed a turn, crashed into a tree,

27:34.000 --> 27:36.400
flipped over and burst into flames.

27:36.400 --> 27:41.120
Mark Harmon smashed the windows out with a sledgehammer

27:41.120 --> 27:42.560
and pulled the boys to safety.

27:42.560 --> 27:45.440
He was just holding the sledgehammer sitting on his porch

27:45.440 --> 27:46.320
as he's want to do.

27:47.520 --> 27:49.360
Fuck yeah, Mark Harmon, hero.

27:50.800 --> 27:51.600
Mark Harmon rules.

27:51.600 --> 27:52.880
Anyway, Mark Harmon.

27:52.880 --> 27:55.040
Also, as long as we're talking about Mark Harmon,

27:55.040 --> 27:57.760
I did a quick Google for NCIS party

27:57.760 --> 27:59.520
to see kind of what was out there.

27:59.520 --> 28:00.240
There's a lot.

28:00.800 --> 28:02.080
It won't surprise you.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.160
A lot of fun cakes, et cetera.

28:04.160 --> 28:10.640
His character on the show NCIS is named Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

28:10.640 --> 28:13.920
Do you think that it was penance for having such a cool name

28:13.920 --> 28:18.160
like Mark Harmon that they had to knock him down a few times?

28:18.160 --> 28:20.240
I feel like one thing you could do for your party

28:20.240 --> 28:22.720
is set your house ablaze in Brentwood

28:23.280 --> 28:25.360
and then Mark will show up.

28:25.360 --> 28:26.400
Be like, I'm here to save you.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.080
And then you quickly douse the flame.

28:28.080 --> 28:29.280
And you're like, Mark, Mark, Mark,

28:29.280 --> 28:32.240
long as you're here, lordy, lordy, look who's 40.

28:32.960 --> 28:33.680
It's me, Mark.

28:34.320 --> 28:35.040
Thank you for coming.

28:35.680 --> 28:36.720
Thank you for coming, Mark.

28:36.720 --> 28:39.520
The second thing I know about NCIS

28:39.520 --> 28:42.400
is that there is a goth woman or a punk woman

28:42.400 --> 28:44.960
who seems very prevalent in the show.

28:45.520 --> 28:47.600
I believe her name is Abby on the show.

28:48.480 --> 28:49.040
How do you know that?

28:49.040 --> 28:50.400
She's on all the NCIS.

28:50.400 --> 28:53.120
Because I've been reading this Yahoo, Travis.

28:54.960 --> 28:55.840
I want to just-

28:55.840 --> 28:59.360
There's someone named Donald Ducky Mallard.

28:59.360 --> 29:00.400
There's a lot of fun.

29:00.400 --> 29:00.640
Listen, they have fun with the names.

29:00.640 --> 29:02.320
NCIS creators.

29:02.320 --> 29:02.880
Yeah.

29:02.880 --> 29:06.160
But Ducky is his nickname and Mallard is his last name.

29:06.160 --> 29:09.200
Like, you could have gotten to Ducky just from Donald

29:09.200 --> 29:11.360
or Ducky just from Mallard,

29:11.360 --> 29:14.720
but you went ahead and named Donald the most famous duck

29:14.720 --> 29:16.160
and also Mallard.

29:16.160 --> 29:18.960
Yeah, I mean, there's a character on the chief of the NCIS

29:18.960 --> 29:21.120
is named Bill Butthole Rectum.

29:21.120 --> 29:23.840
They just really went wild with the names.

29:23.840 --> 29:28.320
So NCIS stands for Naval Criminal Investigative Services, right?

29:28.320 --> 29:30.000
So they investigate crimes

29:30.000 --> 29:31.760
that have to do with the Navy and the Marines.

29:32.480 --> 29:34.960
That show has been going on for 15 seasons.

29:34.960 --> 29:36.960
Hey, Navy, are you okay?

29:36.960 --> 29:40.480
Because it seems like you maybe have a lot of crime.

29:40.480 --> 29:42.800
It seems like there's a lot of crime going on with y'all.

29:42.800 --> 29:43.600
I mean, I learned that-

29:43.600 --> 29:44.480
You and JAG.

29:44.480 --> 29:45.520
I learned that on JAG.

29:45.520 --> 29:47.760
Yeah, JAG has just really opened my eyes to-

29:47.760 --> 29:48.960
Holy shit.

29:48.960 --> 29:51.920
JAG and NCIS are in the same universe.

29:51.920 --> 29:52.160
Yes.

29:52.160 --> 29:53.600
Two episodes in season eight of JAG.

29:53.600 --> 29:56.000
It's called the, Travis, it's called the Viewisk universe.

29:56.000 --> 29:56.800
Yes.

29:56.800 --> 29:58.800
Ice Queen and Meltdown.

29:58.800 --> 30:00.320
Two episodes from season eight of JAG.

30:00.320 --> 30:02.000
We're back to our pilots for NCIS

30:02.000 --> 30:04.400
that featured Mark Harmon as Gibbs

30:04.400 --> 30:06.320
on those JAG episodes.

30:06.880 --> 30:08.080
Yeah, it's called a spinoff.

30:08.080 --> 30:08.640
It's called a spinoff.

30:08.640 --> 30:09.600
But from JAG.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.280
NCIS is a spinoff from JAG, I had no idea.

30:11.280 --> 30:12.560
It's called a JAG-off.

30:13.600 --> 30:14.800
I wanted to read this question

30:14.800 --> 30:18.560
because there's Yahoo Answers user named Lady Die who says,

30:19.280 --> 30:21.440
be sure that you either have an actual mystery to solve

30:21.440 --> 30:22.400
as the evening progresses

30:22.400 --> 30:24.560
or that you simply use the theme as a backdrop.

30:24.560 --> 30:26.160
There really isn't any right way or wrong way

30:26.160 --> 30:26.960
to do a birthday party.

30:26.960 --> 30:27.920
But if you wanna throw the party

30:27.920 --> 30:28.960
that everyone will be talking about,

30:28.960 --> 30:30.960
you need to create a specific crime

30:30.960 --> 30:32.240
for the scene you're investigating

30:32.240 --> 30:34.880
and leave clues everywhere to help with the investigation.

30:34.880 --> 30:36.880
Decorating your crime scene party crime scene tape

30:36.880 --> 30:38.080
and chalk outlines on the floor

30:38.080 --> 30:39.440
are easy additions to your theme.

30:39.440 --> 30:41.440
Make sure to leave them realistic in size

30:41.440 --> 30:42.640
by having a person actually lay down

30:42.640 --> 30:43.840
for you to draw the outline.

30:43.840 --> 30:45.760
You might leave fake footprints, fingerprints,

30:45.760 --> 30:46.880
and clue cards throughout the room,

30:46.880 --> 30:49.280
not too well hidden unless you want people snooping.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.280
You can even get help when leaving the clues

30:51.280 --> 30:53.760
and decorating because of the novelty of this sort of party.

30:53.760 --> 30:56.080
You do not have to confine the festivities to one room

30:56.080 --> 30:58.080
and you can, if you're feeling truly adventurous,

30:58.080 --> 31:00.000
have a different case going on in different rooms.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.520
Just have the guests draw numbers for teams

31:01.520 --> 31:03.040
and then race to solve the crime first.

31:03.040 --> 31:04.400
This is a fairly huge undertaking,

31:04.400 --> 31:06.480
but it will make the party remembered for years.

31:06.480 --> 31:07.840
You might also wanna set up a lab

31:07.840 --> 31:09.200
complete with a microscope and tables

31:09.200 --> 31:10.800
dedicated to sorting out the evidence

31:10.800 --> 31:12.560
and making notes for the shocking conclusion

31:12.560 --> 31:13.680
of the crimes in question.

31:13.680 --> 31:15.520
Of course, you'll wanna make the crime simple and solvable

31:15.520 --> 31:17.440
by leaving clues that guests will have no trouble finding

31:17.440 --> 31:19.440
or deciphering without making it too easy.

31:19.440 --> 31:21.360
Use your favorite episode for guidance if you must

31:21.360 --> 31:23.520
and throw in a red herring or two to keep things fun.

31:23.520 --> 31:25.200
There are reruns that you should have no problem

31:25.200 --> 31:27.360
finding a show that will give you some great ideas.

31:27.360 --> 31:29.200
For free, you can have an actual NCIS cake

31:29.200 --> 31:31.040
or go with cookies that are shaped like footprints

31:31.040 --> 31:34.000
or thumbprint cookies for an excellent play on words.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.400
Sloppy Joes, pizza, finger foods, chips and dips,

31:36.400 --> 31:38.560
and cookies and cake will have an excellent food addition

31:38.560 --> 31:40.880
to the party without needing to fit into any one theme.

31:40.880 --> 31:43.280
Be sure to have plenty of soda and bottled water on hand.

31:43.280 --> 31:46.080
Here's a picture of an NCIS cake, and then I put a link.

31:46.080 --> 31:48.480
This is so pure and so good,

31:48.480 --> 31:50.560
and the first time that somebody's ever asked anything

31:50.560 --> 31:52.880
on Yahoo Answers where a good, helpful,

31:52.880 --> 31:57.760
kind Christian person swoops in with a fucking manual

31:57.760 --> 31:59.760
on how to perfectly do the thing.

31:59.760 --> 32:02.560
I wanted to include this because hope's not all lost.

32:02.560 --> 32:04.080
Most things are bad.

32:04.080 --> 32:05.520
90% of the things are bad,

32:05.520 --> 32:07.680
but then there's Yahoo Answers user, Lady Di,

32:07.680 --> 32:09.120
who swoops in here is like,

32:09.120 --> 32:10.400
you know what's good at parties?

32:10.400 --> 32:11.680
Sloppy Joes sometimes.

32:11.680 --> 32:13.280
How about a fingerprint cookie?

32:13.280 --> 32:15.520
I like the inclusion of the line,

32:15.520 --> 32:17.520
make sure to have soda and water available.

32:17.520 --> 32:19.520
That's not NCIS specific.

32:19.520 --> 32:20.720
It's just a good overall.

32:20.720 --> 32:22.160
It's a good party thing.

32:22.160 --> 32:25.200
I've never seen NCIS, a single frame of it.

32:25.760 --> 32:27.920
But this, what I love about this,

32:27.920 --> 32:30.240
and the reason I was troubled doing it,

32:30.240 --> 32:35.120
is I was worried that Lady Di had confused NCIS with CSI.

32:35.760 --> 32:38.400
No, I think they also do plenty of CSI-ing.

32:38.400 --> 32:39.600
Okay, because this would also,

32:40.720 --> 32:42.880
then this is not a qualm I have with Lady Di.

32:42.880 --> 32:45.920
This is a qualm I have with the creators of NCIS.

32:46.480 --> 32:50.320
You made your letters sound like a preexisting thing, CSI.

32:50.320 --> 32:51.120
You used three of the same.

32:51.120 --> 32:52.240
You just added an N in there

32:52.240 --> 32:53.840
and then kind of flipped them all around.

32:53.840 --> 32:56.480
Right, which also could be New Orleans CSI,

32:56.480 --> 32:58.880
I think is in there, or is it NCIS New Orleans?

32:58.880 --> 33:00.720
Who even fucking knows anymore?

33:00.720 --> 33:05.120
I mean, I know because NCIS New Orleans has my boy, Scott Bakula.

33:05.120 --> 33:06.960
I'm just talking about the title, Griffin.

33:06.960 --> 33:09.360
Okay, I just wanted to talk about Scott Bakula.

33:09.360 --> 33:13.360
If you're going to use three of the same letters in your thing,

33:14.320 --> 33:17.760
maybe don't have so much like microscopes

33:17.760 --> 33:19.040
and fingerprints and stuff.

33:19.600 --> 33:22.640
This is GSI, grime scene investigation.

33:23.200 --> 33:26.080
Investigate all the grimiest scenes.

33:26.080 --> 33:29.040
Do we want to move on to the money zone or?

33:29.040 --> 33:30.080
I want to move on to the money zone

33:30.080 --> 33:32.560
so that we can get to our guest segment even faster.

33:32.560 --> 33:33.200
So let's do it.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.520
I want to tell everybody about Wink.

33:45.520 --> 33:47.760
That's W-I-N-C, Wink.

33:48.800 --> 33:50.480
Wink's wine experts select wines

33:50.480 --> 33:51.920
matched to your taste, personalized for you,

33:51.920 --> 33:53.440
and then they ship them right to your door

33:53.440 --> 33:55.600
just starting at 13 bucks a bottle.

33:55.600 --> 33:58.400
How it works is you go to Wink's website,

33:58.400 --> 34:01.840
which is trywink, T-R-Y-W-I-N-C.com,

34:01.840 --> 34:03.760
and you fill out their palette profile quiz

34:03.760 --> 34:04.880
and you answer simple questions

34:04.880 --> 34:06.240
like how do you take your coffee

34:06.240 --> 34:08.160
and how do you feel about blueberries?

34:08.160 --> 34:09.680
Yes to both.

34:09.680 --> 34:10.800
I'm afraid of them.

34:10.800 --> 34:12.160
How do I take my coffee?

34:12.160 --> 34:12.640
Yes.

34:12.640 --> 34:14.240
How do you feel about blueberries?

34:14.240 --> 34:14.960
Very scared.

34:15.680 --> 34:17.520
There are no membership fees you can skip any month

34:17.520 --> 34:18.960
and you can cancel at any time

34:18.960 --> 34:20.640
and it makes a good holiday gift.

34:20.640 --> 34:22.080
You can send a personalized gift card

34:22.080 --> 34:25.600
and let your recipient choose their wine from Wink's great selection.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.080
You can discover great wine today

34:28.080 --> 34:29.280
if you go to trywink.com.

34:29.280 --> 34:33.440
Again, T-R-Y-W-I-N-C.com slash my brother

34:33.440 --> 34:36.480
and you'll get $20 off your first shipment one more time.

34:36.480 --> 34:42.160
That is trywink.com, T-R-Y-W-I-N-C.com slash my brother for 20 bucks off.

34:42.720 --> 34:44.800
I want to tell you about Stitch Fix

34:44.800 --> 34:47.760
and I'm really excited because I just got my first Stitch Fix box.

34:47.760 --> 34:48.800
Me too!

34:48.800 --> 34:50.080
Three days ago, right?

34:50.080 --> 34:51.040
It was amazing.

34:51.040 --> 34:52.160
It's very good.

34:52.160 --> 34:55.520
I've been on it for like six months.

34:55.520 --> 34:58.160
I'm doing it even when they're not giving it to me for free.

34:58.160 --> 34:58.880
I adore it.

34:58.880 --> 35:00.080
Oh, I've continued now.

35:00.080 --> 35:05.440
Like I actually just made my next box come even faster

35:05.440 --> 35:07.040
because I couldn't wait to get more of it.

35:07.680 --> 35:10.000
But I got a flannel shirt in this box

35:10.000 --> 35:12.720
that was like an instant favorite.

35:12.720 --> 35:15.280
Like I pulled it out and was like, yes, I wore it that day.

35:15.280 --> 35:16.240
It was so amazing.

35:17.120 --> 35:19.600
So basically, here's how it works.

35:19.600 --> 35:23.280
It's a new way to shop for clothes that does all the work for you.

35:23.280 --> 35:24.880
Sweater weather's here, folks.

35:24.880 --> 35:25.920
And if you're like me-

35:25.920 --> 35:27.280
It got really serious there.

35:27.280 --> 35:28.720
Well, hi, I'm Travis McElroy.

35:28.720 --> 35:30.480
I'd like to talk to you about sweater weather.

35:30.480 --> 35:32.240
I forgot to buy any sweaters.

35:32.240 --> 35:34.160
I just, I moved back from Los Angeles.

35:34.720 --> 35:37.440
I didn't leave my house at all last year when I lived in Cincinnati

35:37.440 --> 35:40.320
because I had a baby and I was scared of the outside world

35:40.320 --> 35:42.080
and I forgot to buy any sweaters.

35:42.080 --> 35:44.560
So that's where I turned to Stitch Fix.

35:44.560 --> 35:47.680
You go online, answer some questions about your sizes,

35:47.680 --> 35:49.840
favorite styles and budget.

35:49.840 --> 35:51.120
And I love that, by the way.

35:51.120 --> 35:53.440
You can put not just like your budget for spending,

35:53.440 --> 35:55.520
but your budget for individual items.

35:55.520 --> 35:56.320
So you can say like-

35:56.320 --> 35:58.560
How much are you willing to spend on a sweater?

35:58.560 --> 35:59.040
Right.

35:59.040 --> 36:01.200
Or like a t-shirt or socks or whatever.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.680
You can say like, I don't want to spend more than blank on t-shirts.

36:04.480 --> 36:06.560
And your personal stylist will pick five pieces

36:06.560 --> 36:08.480
based on your preference and send them to your door.

36:08.480 --> 36:10.960
And then you try them on at home.

36:11.600 --> 36:14.240
And if you don't like something, you don't pay for it.

36:14.240 --> 36:14.960
You just send it back.

36:14.960 --> 36:16.160
You only pay for what you keep.

36:16.160 --> 36:20.080
And there's no subscription and it's no club to join.

36:20.080 --> 36:21.520
You just order stuff.

36:21.520 --> 36:23.520
You say you need stuff when you need it.

36:23.520 --> 36:27.680
So get started now at stitchfix.com slash my brother,

36:27.680 --> 36:31.280
and you'll get 25% off when you keep all five items.

36:31.280 --> 36:34.960
So that's stitchfix.com slash my brother,

36:34.960 --> 36:37.520
stitchfix.com slash my brother.

36:38.480 --> 36:41.200
Yeah, and the cool thing is that it evolves.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.440
So like you give them feedback when you get a box

36:43.440 --> 36:45.200
and then they'll take that feedback into consideration

36:45.200 --> 36:46.320
the next time they send you something.

36:46.320 --> 36:47.360
It only gets better.

36:47.360 --> 36:49.760
And also, I was really impressed by this.

36:49.760 --> 36:51.280
Along with the items they send you,

36:51.280 --> 36:54.160
they send you suggestions of other things

36:54.160 --> 36:56.160
you could wear with those items.

36:56.160 --> 36:58.240
Love that, need that, need that.

36:58.240 --> 37:00.480
Juice, do you want to read this next message?

37:00.480 --> 37:02.720
Yeah, have you noticed how the world is filled with problems

37:02.720 --> 37:04.480
and that the leaders supposed to solve them

37:04.480 --> 37:07.120
are all a bunch of sad squares and sad square boxes

37:07.120 --> 37:08.640
who could really chill the heck out?

37:08.640 --> 37:09.840
Ryan and John sure did.

37:09.840 --> 37:12.480
They noticed so hard that they bought a microphone

37:12.480 --> 37:15.120
and set up shop solving the world's toughest problems

37:15.120 --> 37:19.120
with the help of the stickiest of green herbs.

37:19.120 --> 37:21.440
Excellent, I was wondering, I was waiting for the twist.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.840
Twist, they're high.

37:23.840 --> 37:25.680
Join them every few weeks.

37:25.680 --> 37:28.880
That's a very cool, that's a very chill release schedule.

37:29.840 --> 37:30.400
I don't know.

37:31.360 --> 37:36.640
Sometimes, join them sometimes on the Hypocrisy podcast

37:36.640 --> 37:38.640
as they get creative, fix the world,

37:38.640 --> 37:42.560
and fend off rabid dogs and smoke a lot of weed.

37:42.560 --> 37:47.200
And that's Hypocrisy, H-I-G-H-P-O-C-R-A-C-Y.

37:47.200 --> 37:52.640
You can go to Hypocrisy.zone or find, it's so good,

37:52.640 --> 37:55.040
or find them wherever you get your podcasts.

37:55.680 --> 37:59.360
Got another message for Mackenzie and it's from Caitlin.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.920
It says, happy birthday to my favorite sister-in-law.

38:01.920 --> 38:05.520
I can't wait to see you, Robert and Peps,

38:05.520 --> 38:08.240
so I can show her all the best food in Austin

38:08.240 --> 38:10.800
and solidify my position as her favorite aunt.

38:10.800 --> 38:12.720
Love you lots, Caitlin.

38:12.720 --> 38:15.360
And that's next available, is what that says.

38:15.360 --> 38:18.720
So like, they're just really taking a shot in the dark there.

38:18.720 --> 38:22.160
This is them gilting them for an Austin trip.

38:22.160 --> 38:24.240
Like no matter what time of year this lands,

38:24.880 --> 38:27.520
gotta get you down here, gotta get the barbecue,

38:27.520 --> 38:28.800
gotta have the tacos.

38:28.800 --> 38:30.640
Two more quick plugs before we move on

38:30.640 --> 38:32.400
to our amazing, amazing guest segment

38:32.400 --> 38:35.120
that I'm so excited, so I'm gonna make up really quick.

38:35.120 --> 38:37.600
Schmaners is going to be performing

38:37.600 --> 38:39.760
at San Francisco Sketch Fest this year.

38:39.760 --> 38:45.040
On the first Sunday, I believe it's the 14th, January 14th.

38:45.760 --> 38:50.880
So you can go to bit.ly forward slash SF Schmaners,

38:50.880 --> 38:55.040
S-F-S-H-M-A-N-N-E-R-S, go check that out.

38:55.040 --> 38:56.960
Did you just forget how to spell your own podcast?

38:56.960 --> 38:58.640
Well, there's a lot of S's in there.

38:58.640 --> 38:59.280
Sure, sure.

38:59.280 --> 39:02.320
Yeah, and also Schmaners is going to be performing

39:02.320 --> 39:05.120
on the JoCo Cruise along a lot of other stuff.

39:05.120 --> 39:06.240
Dad's gonna be there.

39:06.240 --> 39:08.960
We're gonna be doing a lot of like special events

39:08.960 --> 39:09.680
and that kind of thing.

39:09.680 --> 39:12.560
You can find out about that at JoCoCruise.com,

39:12.560 --> 39:15.760
J-O-C-O Cruise.com, and that is in February.

39:15.760 --> 39:17.440
I believe it starts February 18th.

39:18.080 --> 39:20.400
In general, it's an amazing lineup and amazing cruise.

39:20.400 --> 39:21.280
Go check it out.

39:21.280 --> 39:24.000
All right, I can't believe you're about to hear

39:24.000 --> 39:25.440
this segment that you're about to hear.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.080
We had a very special guest on the show

39:29.040 --> 39:31.840
and he's legitimately a hero of mine

39:31.840 --> 39:35.280
and it is bizarre that he agreed to do our program,

39:35.280 --> 39:38.960
but he did, so there.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.480
So I guess we should just get into it.

39:42.480 --> 39:44.400
Is there any sort of setup we need, I guess?

39:44.400 --> 39:46.080
Well, one thing that's really important to me

39:46.080 --> 39:48.400
is that we play a MaxFun promo right now.

39:48.400 --> 39:50.800
Hey, Biz, have you seen any good movies lately?

39:50.800 --> 39:53.920
Hey, Teresa, does Curious George's boo fest count?

39:53.920 --> 39:54.400
It doesn't.

39:54.960 --> 39:56.640
Well, I blame my current life situation

39:56.640 --> 39:58.880
that has small children that need things.

39:58.880 --> 40:02.080
God, I love them and I miss knowing about stuff.

40:02.080 --> 40:05.120
Well, after catching up on the current cultural offerings

40:05.120 --> 40:07.520
on podcasts that provide such information,

40:07.520 --> 40:09.680
join us on One Bad Mother as we help explore

40:09.680 --> 40:13.040
the harsh realities of sweeping self-identity changes

40:13.040 --> 40:14.480
as we try to find ourselves

40:14.480 --> 40:16.800
between our pre- and post-kid selves.

40:16.800 --> 40:18.560
I used to like all the things.

40:19.120 --> 40:22.000
Download One Bad Mother on MaximumFun.org

40:22.000 --> 40:23.360
for Apple podcasts.

40:23.360 --> 40:24.880
And yes, there will be swears.

40:24.880 --> 40:27.280
All right.

40:27.280 --> 40:30.080
Well, you ready to get started?

40:30.080 --> 40:31.280
Y'all settled?

40:32.000 --> 40:33.120
I thought we were starting.

40:33.120 --> 40:34.400
Let's roll.

40:34.400 --> 40:34.960
This is it.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.000
This is the show.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.920
I've had a nap and an espresso.

40:37.920 --> 40:38.960
This could go anywhere.

40:40.640 --> 40:45.840
Maya, our guest this week, as surreal as it is for me to say,

40:46.640 --> 40:48.480
is Mr. Jimmy Buffett.

40:49.440 --> 40:51.280
Hello, and welcome to the program.

40:51.280 --> 40:54.160
Oh, oh, no, I'm not going to do the show.

40:54.160 --> 40:57.200
Oh, that was, well, all right, bye, everybody.

40:57.200 --> 41:00.240
I just, I just decided, I didn't tell y'all that.

41:00.240 --> 41:01.360
No, no, you just didn't,

41:01.360 --> 41:03.200
because he called you Mr. Jimmy Buffett.

41:03.200 --> 41:04.400
Was that why you didn't want to do the show?

41:04.400 --> 41:04.960
Yeah, that Mr. stuff.

41:04.960 --> 41:06.480
If you call me Jimmy, I'll continue.

41:06.480 --> 41:09.280
But if you call me Mr. Buffett, I'm out of here.

41:09.280 --> 41:10.880
All right, Jimmy, Jimmy it is.

41:10.880 --> 41:12.720
Okay, all right, Jess.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.000
You got a new-

41:14.000 --> 41:15.680
Take two, hey, how you guys doing?

41:15.680 --> 41:17.760
Hey, pretty good, doing great, Jimmy.

41:17.760 --> 41:18.800
Great, great.

41:18.800 --> 41:20.800
Great, great.

41:20.800 --> 41:24.000
You got a new album out, Buried Treasure, volume one.

41:24.720 --> 41:27.200
Yeah, new album full of a lot of old stuff.

41:27.840 --> 41:29.760
Now, I hate listening to anything

41:29.760 --> 41:31.520
I recorded more than two weeks ago.

41:32.240 --> 41:35.440
So how do you, how did you feel digging these up

41:35.440 --> 41:38.160
and hearing them for the first time in a long time?

41:39.760 --> 41:45.840
You know, what I did is I went and into my little studio.

41:45.840 --> 41:48.160
I was in New York in the summer and I went out to the studio,

41:48.160 --> 41:51.040
I took a bottle of wine and had a few glasses of wine

41:51.600 --> 41:53.760
and went back and just, I was curious.

41:53.760 --> 41:55.760
And I wanted to go listen to them because,

41:56.400 --> 41:59.600
you know, the name comes from the kind of

42:00.720 --> 42:02.480
the way that it actually happened.

42:02.480 --> 42:05.840
They weren't buried in the ground, like in the dirt or anything,

42:05.840 --> 42:11.280
but they were actually lost tapes in some,

42:11.280 --> 42:14.720
you know, closet or storage facility.

42:14.720 --> 42:16.880
And when they went to sell the studio,

42:16.880 --> 42:18.320
they opened it up and there they were.

42:18.320 --> 42:23.840
So be that as it may, it was kind of a time machine, you know.

42:23.840 --> 42:29.600
So I was interested in the fact that there were over 120 songs there

42:29.600 --> 42:32.560
and I could not remember writing that many songs.

42:32.560 --> 42:36.160
So that's what kind of got me interested.

42:36.160 --> 42:38.320
So I wanted to go listen to them all.

42:38.320 --> 42:39.360
And so I did.

42:39.360 --> 42:44.240
And then I started laughing and it was kind of fun and amusing

42:44.240 --> 42:49.120
because good God, did I sound like, I sounded so much.

42:49.120 --> 42:52.720
I know who I was, who I was channeling in those days

42:52.720 --> 42:53.920
and it was Gordon Lightfoot.

42:53.920 --> 42:55.680
And boy, it was just, it was way too close.

42:55.680 --> 42:56.640
He should have sued me.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.680
So I listened to them all

42:59.680 --> 43:03.520
and then I tried to figure out what to do with them.

43:03.520 --> 43:07.040
And the interesting thing was, you know, first idea was,

43:07.040 --> 43:10.640
is this worth anything when people want to hear it?

43:10.640 --> 43:12.960
Because, you know, once you get to one stage,

43:12.960 --> 43:14.800
if you've survived this long in the business,

43:14.800 --> 43:17.680
it's not like trying to do something new every year

43:17.680 --> 43:19.360
and kind of keep the ball rolling.

43:19.360 --> 43:21.040
I just try to make things

43:21.040 --> 43:22.960
that if people want to add to their collection

43:22.960 --> 43:24.320
based on what they've heard

43:24.320 --> 43:26.320
and been such loyal fans about before,

43:26.880 --> 43:28.400
then that's what a project is.

43:28.400 --> 43:32.400
So I kind of put it up, weighted against those parameters,

43:32.400 --> 43:36.160
which were, you know, would this be something fans would be interested in?

43:36.160 --> 43:40.000
Something, you know, that was this raw and this far back.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.160
And I thought maybe they would,

43:42.160 --> 43:47.120
but then the other thing that kind of pushed me to the conclusion

43:47.120 --> 43:51.040
of yes, they would was that the songs themselves,

43:51.040 --> 43:53.120
when I heard them kind of conjured up visions

43:53.120 --> 43:54.640
of the people playing them,

43:54.640 --> 43:57.040
what was going on in my life at the time,

43:57.040 --> 43:58.480
which was actually nothing.

44:01.600 --> 44:03.280
Because nobody knew who I was

44:03.280 --> 44:06.000
except these five guys I'd go to the studio with.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.240
I also thought it would be unique to capture

44:09.840 --> 44:11.920
these guys who were still, A, alive

44:11.920 --> 44:14.960
and B, in mobile, who were the guys that kind of

44:16.080 --> 44:17.920
were the only ones that knew me at the time

44:17.920 --> 44:19.920
when they were putting bands together

44:19.920 --> 44:22.720
and helping try to promote me coming out of the studio.

44:22.720 --> 44:25.040
So I thought that was a kind of unique thing

44:25.040 --> 44:26.640
to get their perspective in.

44:26.640 --> 44:29.040
And then my daughter did a video

44:29.040 --> 44:32.640
or a little documentary on all these guys who were in the studio.

44:32.640 --> 44:34.960
So that's how the whole thing kind of,

44:34.960 --> 44:36.560
it grew into what it became.

44:36.560 --> 44:39.680
And then when it did come out,

44:39.680 --> 44:42.960
all of a sudden I looked at it and the packaging alone

44:42.960 --> 44:45.680
was worth doing it because Kim and her team,

44:45.680 --> 44:47.040
the people that did it out in New York,

44:47.040 --> 44:49.280
did a great job of putting this whole thing together.

44:49.280 --> 44:52.000
Two, again, I thought at that point

44:52.000 --> 44:54.400
we'd done what the objective was,

44:54.400 --> 44:57.440
was to make something that if people liked what we did,

44:57.440 --> 44:59.360
they could add this to their collection.

44:59.360 --> 45:03.120
And that's kind of the way it happened in a short version.

45:03.760 --> 45:05.600
Well, I was listening to it this morning

45:05.600 --> 45:06.480
and enjoying it a lot.

45:06.480 --> 45:08.640
So I think it's great that you got it out there.

45:08.640 --> 45:12.320
We got a lot of people wanting your sage wisdom here.

45:12.320 --> 45:14.560
A lot of our listeners wrote in with questions

45:14.560 --> 45:15.440
and I'm just gonna hit you with-

45:15.440 --> 45:16.560
Stage wisdom?

45:16.560 --> 45:17.520
Sage wisdom.

45:17.520 --> 45:18.020
I know.

45:18.800 --> 45:20.640
Did you say sage or stage?

45:21.360 --> 45:23.360
I can do both, which way do you want?

45:23.360 --> 45:25.120
You're sage, stage, wisdom.

45:25.120 --> 45:26.080
Sage, stage, wisdom.

45:26.080 --> 45:27.840
Stage, sage, wisdom, either way.

45:28.400 --> 45:31.200
This is the first one and you asked for questions

45:31.200 --> 45:34.080
about sailing, lionfish in Puerto Rico.

45:34.080 --> 45:36.000
We have all three covered.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.280
So you're in good hands.

45:37.280 --> 45:38.640
That covers some things, huh?

45:38.640 --> 45:39.920
We got all the bases, here we go.

45:40.560 --> 45:41.680
Here's our first question.

45:41.680 --> 45:44.400
Do you have any recommendations for a city slicker

45:44.400 --> 45:46.320
who wants to get into sailing?

45:46.320 --> 45:49.280
Are there books to read before taking an actual course?

45:49.840 --> 45:54.160
Any places or organizations that would get your seal of approval?

45:54.160 --> 45:57.600
That's from the only bait in Phinadelphia is their name.

45:59.040 --> 46:01.920
Phinadelphia, I like that.

46:01.920 --> 46:04.640
From a city slicker to go sailing,

46:04.640 --> 46:09.120
I would certainly say that reading is the first thing to do

46:09.120 --> 46:10.400
and read books.

46:11.840 --> 46:16.720
And then because there's so much great stuff out there

46:16.720 --> 46:18.240
and if I was going to boil it down,

46:18.240 --> 46:20.240
of course Treasure Island was the first one.

46:20.240 --> 46:21.920
But if you really want to read some good stuff,

46:21.920 --> 46:24.560
it would be the Patrick O'Brien series

46:25.680 --> 46:33.120
about Albury and I can't remember Captain Jack Albury.

46:33.120 --> 46:35.600
And I can't remember his sidekick.

46:35.600 --> 46:38.480
But it's a great series of books

46:38.480 --> 46:41.440
about the British Navy and the Napoleonic Wars.

46:41.440 --> 46:45.920
And it's because the great thing about it is

46:45.920 --> 46:49.680
it gets into the way people actually lived on boats back then.

46:49.680 --> 46:52.640
You know, we think of them as you see them in movies

46:52.640 --> 46:55.440
and there's just pirates and there's people on boats.

46:55.440 --> 46:56.480
I mean, when they went,

46:56.480 --> 46:58.320
they didn't know when they were coming back.

46:58.320 --> 47:01.200
They had live animals, you know,

47:01.200 --> 47:04.240
they all played music too because, you know,

47:04.240 --> 47:06.240
there was no wifi back in those days.

47:06.240 --> 47:10.800
And so most sailors had an instrument

47:10.800 --> 47:13.120
or played an instrument and it's the way also

47:13.120 --> 47:16.240
that a lot of music and different music

47:16.240 --> 47:18.000
from around the world found its way

47:18.000 --> 47:20.400
to other cultures was on boats.

47:20.400 --> 47:24.480
So that all kind of, they're great adventures

47:24.480 --> 47:26.240
but they take the essence of sailing

47:26.240 --> 47:29.280
and how people lived and how they entertained themselves

47:29.280 --> 47:30.320
when they weren't fighting

47:30.320 --> 47:34.000
or when they weren't off, you know, in raging storms.

47:34.000 --> 47:35.920
There was a lot of dull time on boats

47:35.920 --> 47:38.000
and believe me, as one who sailed a lot,

47:38.000 --> 47:39.600
you try to find some things to do.

47:39.600 --> 47:41.840
So I think reading about it first

47:41.840 --> 47:44.880
and then, you know, go down,

47:44.880 --> 47:48.720
go find yourself a little sailing school somewhere.

47:48.720 --> 47:51.840
If you live in Philly, you can go to the Jersey Shore,

47:51.840 --> 47:57.360
you know, and get in a boat and if you don't puke,

47:57.360 --> 47:58.640
then keep going.

47:58.640 --> 48:01.680
Now, I gotta be honest, of all the sailing advice

48:01.680 --> 48:03.440
I expected to get from Jimmy Buffett,

48:03.440 --> 48:05.200
make sure you read up on it first.

48:05.200 --> 48:08.960
It's not one of the things I expected to hear.

48:08.960 --> 48:13.040
Not a lot of that.

48:13.040 --> 48:14.480
You know what, I'll just go throw them in a boat

48:14.480 --> 48:16.400
and point them out there and go try to get back.

48:16.400 --> 48:18.400
Yeah, you'll be fine, bye.

48:18.400 --> 48:19.680
Yeah, they'll figure it out, right?

48:19.680 --> 48:23.920
No, I'm not a Captain Blah, you know,

48:23.920 --> 48:25.680
you gotta read about it first, yeah.

48:25.680 --> 48:27.120
Jimmy, I got a question for you.

48:27.120 --> 48:29.440
I'm about to go on my first cruise,

48:29.440 --> 48:33.600
which will be my first time really on a ship of any note

48:33.600 --> 48:35.200
other than like a ferry.

48:35.200 --> 48:37.440
That's a boat with an engine and.

48:37.440 --> 48:39.600
True, but here's my question.

48:39.600 --> 48:41.200
That's a hotel with an engine.

48:41.200 --> 48:43.280
That's a floating hotel we're talking about, right?

48:43.280 --> 48:44.560
Yes, but will there be a point

48:44.560 --> 48:45.840
when I'm in the middle of the ocean

48:45.840 --> 48:49.280
and I can't see land anywhere and my mind just breaks

48:49.280 --> 48:50.480
and I just start screaming

48:50.480 --> 48:51.600
because that's what I'm worried about now.

48:51.600 --> 48:53.600
I think that's called ocean madness.

48:53.600 --> 48:55.200
Yes. Ocean madness.

48:55.200 --> 48:57.200
Well, you know what I would do?

48:57.200 --> 48:59.680
I would start drinking seawater.

48:59.680 --> 49:01.120
Okay.

49:01.120 --> 49:02.720
And that will really make you crazy.

49:02.720 --> 49:04.560
Just really.

49:04.560 --> 49:05.520
Just lean into it.

49:05.520 --> 49:06.960
I'm just kidding.

49:06.960 --> 49:09.120
No, so I'm gonna tell you what.

49:11.280 --> 49:14.240
To me, being out of sight of land

49:14.240 --> 49:17.600
is one of the most pleasant and freeing experiences.

49:17.600 --> 49:21.600
And it'll take you, how long is your cruise?

49:21.600 --> 49:22.960
About a week.

49:22.960 --> 49:23.920
Okay, that's good.

49:23.920 --> 49:26.640
So, see, two days out, it takes a little while

49:26.640 --> 49:29.920
to kind of get your sailor's legs about you,

49:29.920 --> 49:31.920
even if you're on one of those big boats,

49:31.920 --> 49:33.360
because you're moving.

49:33.360 --> 49:37.360
And stay away from the buffet probably

49:37.360 --> 49:39.120
would be a good other thing to do

49:39.120 --> 49:40.320
until you get your sea legs.

49:40.320 --> 49:44.960
But even when I would go out on my little boats

49:44.960 --> 49:47.360
and once you left and you were on there,

49:47.360 --> 49:50.800
you had to kind of readjust your brain,

49:50.800 --> 49:55.600
readjust and your sense of balance has to readjust

49:55.600 --> 49:58.240
whether you're on a big ship or a little ship,

49:58.240 --> 49:59.760
it just automatically will do that

49:59.760 --> 50:01.360
because you're not on real land.

50:02.080 --> 50:04.400
So if you ever notice you get tired out there,

50:04.400 --> 50:07.520
that's your inner ear working to keep your balance up.

50:07.520 --> 50:11.680
So once you do leave land,

50:11.680 --> 50:14.160
you have to reacclimate to being on the water.

50:14.160 --> 50:15.280
So that's like two days.

50:15.280 --> 50:19.600
And then after that, your anxiety should go away

50:19.600 --> 50:20.800
and then you can relax.

50:21.680 --> 50:23.280
Yeah, just try not to think about the fact

50:23.280 --> 50:25.440
that the Poseidon adventure is based on a real story

50:25.440 --> 50:27.760
and it happens to like one third of cruise ships out there.

50:29.200 --> 50:30.800
And then the other thing I wouldn't do

50:30.800 --> 50:34.080
is look at those disaster at sea videos on YouTube

50:34.080 --> 50:35.280
before you go.

50:35.280 --> 50:36.240
There's a lot of them.

50:39.040 --> 50:40.640
Especially the ones with the cruise ships

50:40.640 --> 50:42.800
getting smacked sideways by a 50 foot wave.

50:42.800 --> 50:43.760
I wouldn't watch those.

50:45.520 --> 50:47.440
There's so many because it's so common.

50:47.440 --> 50:48.960
Oh no.

50:48.960 --> 50:49.920
Hope that helped.

50:52.400 --> 50:53.760
There's a great question here I wanna read.

50:54.960 --> 50:57.840
The question is, the boom of my sailboat is terrifying to me.

50:57.840 --> 51:00.080
I'm always worried that sucker is gonna brain me.

51:00.080 --> 51:01.840
How do I overcome my fear of the boom?

51:01.840 --> 51:04.400
And that's from Deliberate Land Dweller in Durham.

51:05.120 --> 51:06.800
Okay, it's called a boom vang.

51:06.800 --> 51:09.120
They make a device that you can put on your boom

51:09.120 --> 51:10.960
and attach to your deck,

51:10.960 --> 51:13.760
which will allow it not to hit you in your head.

51:13.760 --> 51:15.680
So go out and buy a boom vang.

51:15.680 --> 51:17.440
Now let's, Jimmy, just pretend,

51:17.440 --> 51:20.480
I mean, obviously we all know what the boom is,

51:20.480 --> 51:22.560
but let's pretend our listeners don't know

51:22.560 --> 51:24.720
what the boom of a sailboat is.

51:24.720 --> 51:26.320
And maybe you could explain that first.

51:27.040 --> 51:28.560
Okay, it's very simple, okay?

51:28.560 --> 51:30.880
The sail is triangular, so you have a mast

51:30.880 --> 51:35.200
and you raise the sail and the sail is attached to the mast,

51:35.200 --> 51:37.040
but the sail has to move.

51:37.040 --> 51:38.960
So the mast is vertical

51:38.960 --> 51:41.360
and then the boom is the section of the mast

51:41.360 --> 51:44.080
that's horizontal that the sail attaches to

51:44.080 --> 51:46.240
so it can swing back and forth

51:47.440 --> 51:48.880
because you've got to catch the wind

51:48.880 --> 51:50.400
and the wind is always moving.

51:50.400 --> 51:52.160
And the reason it's called a boom

51:52.160 --> 51:56.000
is because when it does hit you in the head, it goes boom.

51:58.160 --> 51:59.440
I don't know what they called it before that.

51:59.440 --> 52:04.080
They call it a perfectly nice steering instrument on a ship.

52:04.080 --> 52:06.320
And a boom vang is just a piece of line

52:06.320 --> 52:07.520
that will tie it to the boat

52:07.520 --> 52:09.280
that will keep it from going boom.

52:10.000 --> 52:11.600
Could you tie pillows to the boom

52:11.600 --> 52:14.320
so that if it does boom you, it's at least sort of,

52:14.320 --> 52:15.280
it cushions the blow?

52:17.360 --> 52:19.680
Of course you could, but I've never seen it.

52:19.680 --> 52:20.960
I feel like you might get some,

52:20.960 --> 52:22.720
I feel like you might get hassled by some of the other sailors.

52:22.720 --> 52:25.040
Let's say they'd probably get soggy, then mildewed,

52:25.040 --> 52:28.320
and then seagulls would shit on them and stuff like that.

52:29.360 --> 52:30.880
They could get funky in a hurry,

52:30.880 --> 52:33.440
so you might not want that pillow as protection.

52:33.440 --> 52:36.240
In my defense, a seagull can shit on any part of a boat

52:36.240 --> 52:38.400
no matter what, pretty much at any time.

52:38.400 --> 52:39.440
That is correct, yeah.

52:39.440 --> 52:40.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:40.960 --> 52:42.480
Here's another question for you, Jimmy.

52:42.480 --> 52:44.480
There's been a push to eat lionfish

52:44.480 --> 52:46.080
in order to curb their numbers

52:46.080 --> 52:47.840
because they're an invasive species.

52:47.840 --> 52:49.440
Have you tried it, would you?

52:50.480 --> 52:54.480
And if you have, did it give you poisonous spines,

52:54.480 --> 52:55.680
I guess, growing out of your body?

52:55.680 --> 52:56.960
I don't see why that would happen.

52:57.920 --> 52:58.800
That's from James.

52:58.800 --> 52:59.280
That's from James.

52:59.280 --> 53:01.920
Well, yeah, I went to the dermatologist

53:01.920 --> 53:02.960
and I got those removed.

53:04.800 --> 53:06.560
No, no, I don't want to scare anybody

53:06.560 --> 53:08.720
because this is kind of a serious subject.

53:08.720 --> 53:10.320
They are an invasive species.

53:10.880 --> 53:14.800
And the thing of it is, if you're a lover of the islands

53:14.800 --> 53:18.240
and water and diving and snorkeling and all that stuff,

53:18.240 --> 53:21.440
which, you know, if you go on vacation,

53:21.440 --> 53:22.480
that's what you want to do,

53:23.040 --> 53:24.960
lionfish are a big problem.

53:24.960 --> 53:26.880
And the fact of it is,

53:26.880 --> 53:29.520
they don't have any natural predators in the ocean.

53:31.520 --> 53:33.680
The thing of it is, you'll never get,

53:34.320 --> 53:38.000
you can't equate it with ciguatera,

53:38.000 --> 53:41.040
which you can get from like reef fish sometimes.

53:41.040 --> 53:43.120
That doesn't happen in the flesh of the lionfish.

53:43.120 --> 53:44.080
And yes, it's good.

53:44.080 --> 53:46.000
We serve it at the restaurant in Margaritaville.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.520
We make sushi out of it.

53:47.520 --> 53:50.240
And we're trying to get people interested

53:50.240 --> 53:52.080
in making it a commercial product,

53:52.080 --> 53:55.520
which makes it something that the price of it would increase

53:55.520 --> 53:59.040
so that more people would go catch them.

53:59.040 --> 54:01.600
You know, you can actually kill a fish

54:01.600 --> 54:02.560
and save a reef here.

54:02.560 --> 54:04.480
You know, that's kind of an oxymoron

54:04.480 --> 54:06.400
when you're out there thinking about trying to save the ocean.

54:06.400 --> 54:08.480
You're trying to prevent everything from dying,

54:08.480 --> 54:12.160
but you can knock off quite a few lionfish

54:12.160 --> 54:13.520
and it's going to help the ocean.

54:13.520 --> 54:15.920
So we're kind of involved actively

54:17.120 --> 54:19.280
in some ways to promote that.

54:19.280 --> 54:20.720
And people are doing it already.

54:20.720 --> 54:22.800
They have lionfish rodeos in Florida and all,

54:23.760 --> 54:26.240
but nobody has had seen them really as a food source

54:26.240 --> 54:29.760
until a couple of people started figuring out

54:29.760 --> 54:30.560
that they were good.

54:31.760 --> 54:33.440
We shot them about five or six years ago

54:33.440 --> 54:34.720
and just brought them up and cooked them

54:34.720 --> 54:35.840
and they were fine.

54:35.840 --> 54:37.360
Cleaning them is a bit of a problem,

54:37.360 --> 54:41.920
but then our people down in our kitchen staff

54:41.920 --> 54:45.440
at the hotel in Hollywood have done just that

54:45.440 --> 54:50.000
to made it an easier way to clean it and not get poked.

54:50.000 --> 54:54.320
And so the only danger to that is in cleaning it.

54:54.320 --> 54:55.440
It's not going to kill you though,

54:55.440 --> 54:57.120
but it does hurt like hell.

54:57.120 --> 55:00.320
But anyway, we're looking at better ways

55:00.320 --> 55:03.120
that we could clean them more efficiently

55:03.120 --> 55:04.880
and make them more of a food commodity

55:04.880 --> 55:06.480
because the fish does taste great.

55:07.040 --> 55:13.040
And that's a great way to get the invasive species

55:13.040 --> 55:13.840
under control.

55:13.840 --> 55:16.720
So we're going to do it and we're doing it at the hotel.

55:16.720 --> 55:19.600
We're going to start doing it down at our little restaurant

55:19.600 --> 55:21.760
at the cruise ship dock in Belize.

55:21.760 --> 55:23.920
If you get, who's going on the cruise,

55:23.920 --> 55:26.560
Travis or Griffin or just Travis?

55:26.560 --> 55:27.200
Just Travis.

55:28.080 --> 55:29.120
Are you going to go to Belize?

55:30.160 --> 55:31.280
I don't think so.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.840
Not unless things go horribly awry.

55:33.840 --> 55:36.320
Yeah, if he ends up in Belize,

55:36.320 --> 55:37.760
something has gone terribly wrong with his-

55:37.760 --> 55:39.120
A perfect storm situation.

55:39.120 --> 55:40.640
Well, I was going to say, if you get down there,

55:40.640 --> 55:42.640
you could go try some lionfish, you know?

55:42.640 --> 55:44.720
I do really want to eat lionfish now.

55:46.160 --> 55:46.960
Where are you going?

55:47.840 --> 55:52.160
We're going down to Cozumel and Cabo.

55:52.160 --> 55:52.880
You're going to Key West?

55:54.320 --> 55:56.160
No, Cozumel and Cabo, okay.

55:56.160 --> 55:58.640
I tell you, Jimmy, if you've never been to Mexico,

55:58.640 --> 56:00.320
you should totally check it out.

56:00.320 --> 56:01.600
It's pretty sick, yeah.

56:01.600 --> 56:03.040
I've heard of it.

56:03.040 --> 56:04.080
That's right.

56:04.080 --> 56:06.240
Have you ever thought about doing an all-you-can-eat

56:06.240 --> 56:08.560
lionfish night in Margaritaville?

56:08.560 --> 56:10.400
I've always wanted to be an inspirational

56:10.400 --> 56:13.600
environmental hero by eating a lot of fish.

56:13.600 --> 56:14.080
I'm in.

56:14.720 --> 56:16.240
What I am going to do is go out,

56:16.240 --> 56:17.520
and when I get back from,

56:18.480 --> 56:20.400
I got to go up and work on the musical.

56:20.400 --> 56:23.120
When I get done with that, I'm going to go out on the boat

56:23.120 --> 56:27.200
and with Carlo, my head chef down there,

56:27.200 --> 56:29.200
who kind of started this thing,

56:29.200 --> 56:31.280
I'm going to go out and shoot some lionfish with him,

56:31.280 --> 56:32.880
and he's going to teach me how to clean them,

56:32.880 --> 56:34.400
and then we're going to cook them right there on the boat,

56:34.400 --> 56:35.680
and then make a video.

56:35.680 --> 56:36.000
Please be careful.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.640
You've said shoot a couple of times now, and I'm wondering if you can-

56:38.640 --> 56:39.200
Yes, spear guns.

56:39.840 --> 56:40.720
Oh, spear guns.

56:40.720 --> 56:41.200
Okay, yes.

56:41.200 --> 56:42.240
That makes a lot of sense now.

56:42.240 --> 56:42.800
Not like shotguns.

56:42.800 --> 56:46.080
No, I'm not taking an AR-15 on your boat right now.

56:46.080 --> 56:48.560
I feel like if we could rebrand the lionfish,

56:48.560 --> 56:51.200
because that's probably my hang up with it,

56:51.200 --> 56:52.480
is that it sounds dangerous.

56:52.480 --> 56:55.120
But the name tuna,

56:56.320 --> 56:58.720
the reason there's only four tuna left,

56:58.720 --> 57:02.080
is the name tuna, just that name sounds so good.

57:02.080 --> 57:02.480
Right.

57:02.480 --> 57:06.240
It sounds really tasty, and safe, and huge, and awesome.

57:06.240 --> 57:07.840
What about tasty fish?

57:07.840 --> 57:08.240
Tasty fish.

57:08.240 --> 57:09.920
We call the lionfish tasty fish.

57:09.920 --> 57:11.920
Tasty, there you go, just call it tasty fish.

57:12.480 --> 57:13.280
Tasty fish.

57:13.280 --> 57:15.440
And we changed tuna to big poison monster.

57:16.320 --> 57:18.640
I don't think we need to drag tuna through the mud.

57:19.360 --> 57:21.280
No, come on, yeah, come on.

57:21.840 --> 57:24.160
Tuna, yeah, tuna's got enough problems here.

57:24.160 --> 57:25.520
We got to get, yeah.

57:25.520 --> 57:27.200
But tasty fish.

57:27.760 --> 57:30.880
Well, you know, when you go into any restaurant now,

57:30.880 --> 57:34.240
and they're serving you like sea bass,

57:35.280 --> 57:40.480
you know, that's a complete, that's fake fish.

57:41.440 --> 57:41.760
Oh.

57:41.760 --> 57:42.640
Oh, no.

57:42.640 --> 57:44.320
No hamburger, or is that chicken that they-

57:44.320 --> 57:46.880
Yeah, I think they serve a lot of it at the White House,

57:46.880 --> 57:47.920
fake fish these days.

57:50.160 --> 57:56.560
But no, it's called the, let's see, it's the tooth fish,

57:56.560 --> 57:59.760
but it's like the Argentina, the South Atlantic tooth fish.

57:59.760 --> 58:01.440
And that's what they are, they're called,

58:01.440 --> 58:05.200
and to your point, nobody's going to eat a tooth fish

58:06.000 --> 58:09.520
with that name, so they just basically renamed them sea bass.

58:09.520 --> 58:10.560
See, let's do that for lionfish.

58:10.560 --> 58:12.880
Chilean sea bass, you know.

58:12.880 --> 58:15.520
They're not any bass out there at all, they're tooth fish.

58:16.080 --> 58:21.520
So the lionfish becomes the temptingly tasty fish.

58:21.520 --> 58:22.880
Yeah, go for it.

58:22.880 --> 58:23.840
Totally eat that.

58:23.840 --> 58:26.000
I have like a, I have a practical question

58:26.000 --> 58:27.200
that wasn't sent in by the audience,

58:27.200 --> 58:28.880
but it's something that I struggle with every time

58:28.880 --> 58:32.560
I go to, every time I go to the beach, I always feel,

58:32.560 --> 58:34.400
and I enjoy going to the beach,

58:34.400 --> 58:38.160
I always feel like I forgot something,

58:38.160 --> 58:40.720
like I could have brought something

58:41.360 --> 58:44.560
to help me feel more comfortable at the beach,

58:44.560 --> 58:48.720
like maybe a better chair so that I'm not getting all sandy,

58:48.720 --> 58:50.640
or it's like a sunshade to-

58:50.640 --> 58:54.000
You notice that the beach has sand on it, correct?

58:54.000 --> 58:56.880
The beach has sand on it, and it gets all over.

58:56.880 --> 58:59.200
It gets all over, I'm curious, when you go to the beach,

58:59.200 --> 59:01.440
which I imagine you do sometimes,

59:01.440 --> 59:03.600
what do you take, like what do you bring with you?

59:03.600 --> 59:06.480
What are like your beach, like survival tools?

59:07.280 --> 59:08.720
My beach survival tool.

59:08.720 --> 59:10.400
Yeah, like a drink or an umbrella.

59:10.400 --> 59:12.800
Because I feel like if I saw Jimmy Buffett at the beach,

59:12.800 --> 59:14.320
I would start to get real paranoid

59:14.320 --> 59:16.080
to make sure I'm doing everything right,

59:16.640 --> 59:18.000
and just sort of try to do-

59:18.000 --> 59:20.080
What I would bring to the beach is my van

59:20.080 --> 59:21.600
that has everything in it.

59:21.600 --> 59:22.560
There we go.

59:22.560 --> 59:23.200
That's so good.

59:23.200 --> 59:24.960
Just drive it right onto the beach.

59:24.960 --> 59:27.760
Drive it, it's four-wheel drive, you drive onto the beach,

59:27.760 --> 59:28.640
and get a van.

59:28.640 --> 59:31.200
That's the first thing I do, and put all your stuff in it.

59:31.200 --> 59:33.120
And they make little vans and big vans,

59:33.120 --> 59:34.880
you know, you can get a little Volkswagen van,

59:35.520 --> 59:38.240
four-wheel drive, let a little air out of the tires,

59:38.240 --> 59:40.000
put it right out on the beach, and there you go.

59:40.880 --> 59:42.880
And you can take everything you want.

59:42.880 --> 59:43.680
That's a good solution.

59:43.680 --> 59:45.040
That's a good solution.

59:45.040 --> 59:45.680
That's really good.

59:45.680 --> 59:47.120
I'm gonna read another audience question.

59:47.120 --> 59:47.520
Okay.

59:47.520 --> 59:50.160
Several years ago, my sister went to Puerto Rico

59:50.160 --> 59:53.440
and brought some home massive avocados.

59:53.440 --> 59:55.760
They were the best avocados I have ever had,

59:55.760 --> 59:57.600
and the guacamole we made from them

59:57.600 --> 01:00:00.640
has made all the guacamole scents seem like trash.

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:03.360
How do I deal with my unreasonably high standards,

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:06.160
and that's from Avocado Don't, know how to quit you?

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:08.080
Avocado Don't.

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.080
Well, I think the thing of it is,

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:16.240
I would kind of research the fact of what's going on

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:18.320
in Puerto Rico in terms of agriculture,

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:22.240
and if your avocado groves are still there,

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:24.560
and if they're not, then I'm sure that there's some people.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.400
There's a lot of people doing great things

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:30.400
in Puerto Rico right now.

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:31.600
I don't know if you ever,

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:34.880
did you see Jose Reyes' piece on 60 Minutes the other day

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.000
about cooking down there?

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.160
If not, you should check it out.

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:42.960
I mean, he literally took the terrible situation

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:45.520
where there was, and as he said, there was food there,

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.880
but people, they were in charge, didn't know how to do it.

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:51.040
He went down and in a matter of two weeks

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.680
was cooking for 100,000 people a day.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:55.120
It's a pretty amazing story.

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:59.600
So there's that kind of care

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:04.560
and that kind of wanting to help on the ground in Puerto Rico,

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:08.000
and I bet you that somebody is reforesting at this moment

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.080
or else evaluating where those giant beautiful avocados are.

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.520
So maybe you want to get involved,

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:18.320
and because the thing about it is as disastrous as hurricanes

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:22.480
are having grown up in Hurricane Alley on the Gulf Coast

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.880
and lived amongst hurricanes,

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:28.080
the nature comes back pretty quick in the tropics,

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:31.920
and it's amazing how fast things grow again.

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:35.440
So I think your avocados will be back

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.760
and maybe you could help them get back.

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:41.840
And help Puerto Rico recover

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.320
and provide any kind of relief that you possibly,

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:47.440
it's been like a couple of months,

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.680
but obviously they still need help.

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:51.440
So this is probably a good time to mention

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:54.480
anything you can give to any organization

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:58.320
that you think can help, like UNICEF for-

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:01.200
The Hispanic Federation is doing a ton of good stuff.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.960
Yeah, and they're doing stuff down there.

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:04.800
And if you can get direct to people that are,

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.160
our hotel got severely damaged there.

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:12.080
So we're basically getting all of our employees back to work,

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.440
cleaning up and getting the hotel back into shape.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.480
So, you know, and trying to just at that level

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.240
make sure that everybody has something to do

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:24.800
as in the process of recovery is going along.

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:29.120
Jim, we got a lot of different versions of this question,

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.200
but this one kind of sums it up.

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:34.880
I work a fairly standard dead-end office job.

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:37.040
As you can imagine, life within a cubicle

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.440
can be unglamorous and sometimes stressful.

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:41.760
I don't have the time to get away from it all often.

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.440
Any tips for relaxing

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.680
and finding my own cheeseburger in paradise

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:47.040
in everyday life?

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:49.840
And that's from Big Boy Job in Baltimore.

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.520
Big Boy Job in Baltimore.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:59.360
I would, I'd go find myself a local bar.

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:00.800
That's what I would do first.

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.680
And they probably had good crab cakes in.

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:08.000
And I know some of those exist in Baltimore.

01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:11.680
And just the other thing to do,

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:14.960
is to get outside a little more,

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:17.680
even if it's cold or even if it's not pouring down rain,

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:20.160
just to get out and walk around without sunglasses

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:23.360
or any glasses on about 45 minutes a day.

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:25.200
It kind of recharges your batteries.

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:27.600
What about corrective glasses, like for bad vision?

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:31.520
Just take them off and try not to walk in traffic

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:32.960
while you're using your phone.

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.560
Do you feel a lot of pressure

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:39.360
to always be the calmest person in the room

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.040
in your day-to-day life?

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:43.280
I feel like if I was doing something

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:44.880
and I saw Jimmy Buffett stressed out,

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.720
I would probably flip my shit, honestly.

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:48.000
It's Jimmy Buffett, man.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.440
Oh God, get out of here.

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:50.880
Jimmy Buffett's not calm.

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:52.400
None of us can be calm right now.

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:53.440
We all have to freak out.

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.720
There are days, let's say that I,

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:59.040
well, I get attentive, okay?

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.560
I don't know if I will.

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:01.760
That's the top of the scale.

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:05.920
Yeah, being rather attentive to a situation

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:08.160
might get at the top of the scale there, you know?

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.560
But I've had a few close calls

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:12.960
and it's either I'm either still supposed to be here

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:17.280
or I'm making up for lost time

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.600
because I should not be here or I'm supposed to be here.

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:22.400
So either way, I'm still glad I am here

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.800
and I'm not on the front nine anymore.

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.320
So I think the older you get,

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.760
all the stresses of life seem to go away

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:30.880
because you don't have a lot of time

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:32.800
to deal with that shit, you know?

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:35.360
So why not go out and try to enjoy every day you got

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.880
and not let everything get you down?

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:39.680
Jimmy, the last time you went to the doctor

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.280
was your blood pressure four?

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:44.880
No, I got my Apple watch on.

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:46.960
I'll tell you what it is right now, okay?

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:47.600
You want to know?

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:49.680
I actually am really curious.

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:51.360
I'm super curious what your blood pressure is.

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.160
Get a blood pressure check.

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:53.200
Get a pulse rate check.

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:54.640
Okay, here it's measuring now.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.400
Okay, let's see here.

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.240
It's 54 beats a minute.

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:03.360
Wow, really?

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:04.480
That's amazing.

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:07.280
Your resting heart rate is like 88 on a good day.

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.080
That's insane.

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:08.800
What's yours now?

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.400
I'm at 99.

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.040
That's rough.

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:16.320
I almost have two Jimmy Buffett hearts inside of me.

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:20.560
I'm at 86, but I'm also recording a podcast with Jimmy Buffett.

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.400
So I feel like I'm allowed to kind of do

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.200
whatever my heart's going to do.

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:24.400
Have a heightened state.

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:28.240
Wait, this podcast is making your blood pressure rise.

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:28.800
That's cool.

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.680
Yeah, it's about the most stressful thing that I do,

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:32.720
believe it or not.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:33.440
It's really cool.

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:35.040
As shameful as that is.

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.800
It's really cool and killing all three of us.

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:37.440
I think you're holding it together pretty well.

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:37.680
I do.

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:38.480
Thanks.

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:41.040
Well, this is the closest we get to physical labor.

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.160
Yeah, this is the hardest.

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:42.400
Yeah.

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:46.800
Where would you rate on a scale of very chill to attentive,

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:50.320
creating a musical based on your music,

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.640
Escape to Margaritaville, which just finished.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:56.320
It's about to wrap up, I guess, tomorrow.

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:58.560
It's run in Chicago and then it's moving to Broadway

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:00.000
middle of February.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.440
How sort of stressful was that?

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.360
Or is that more of a joyful thing?

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.480
Or how was that for you?

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:07.680
It's a bit of yin and yang there because, of course,

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:11.200
it's a dream come true and I've always loved musical theater.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:15.840
And the actual fact that it's happening,

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:18.000
I mean, as I've been to shows,

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.800
we've been in La Jolla, New Orleans, Houston,

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:21.920
now in Chicago.

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:25.040
I sit out there and I love watching the audience

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.400
because I don't get out there that much.

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:29.280
And I love that this show really entertains them.

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:32.800
And I get a big kick out of watching people enjoy the show.

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:35.120
And I have to pinch myself to believe

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:36.320
that this is actually happening.

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:37.680
We're going to Broadway.

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:41.280
And then, I mean, and Justin, you were there

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:44.240
when your good friend, Lin-Manuel Miranda,

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.280
brought you to the show.

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:47.280
And then we could have, how do you think I felt

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:49.120
when he came out and we did Margaritaville?

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:51.440
I go, God, this is cool.

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.440
But I got a little over than attentive.

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:54.320
I got excited.

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:57.600
When Lin-Manuel came on the stage.

01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:58.400
Yes, I did.

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:00.480
Which show do you think is better,

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:02.560
Escape to Margaritaville or Escape to Margaritaville?

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.680
Margaritaville or Hamilton?

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:05.600
And this is the question that is on everyone's lips.

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:07.760
Oh my God, oh God, okay.

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:08.960
Well, let's just say this.

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:13.360
I like them both, but nobody gets killed in Margaritaville.

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:17.440
And they don't drop any beach balls on you in Hamilton.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:23.440
I don't know, it's different skills.

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:25.680
No, but when we did it that day, Justin,

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:28.080
I thought it was pretty cool to go get a history lesson

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.320
and get them, hell, I was crying at the end of Hamilton.

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:32.480
And that's about the eighth or ninth time I've seen it.

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.640
When Who Tells Your Story comes on, they got me again.

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:38.720
That's what's great about it.

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:41.360
But get a history lesson in the afternoon

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:43.840
and feel like you've gone to group therapy

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:45.840
and then go get a drink, go to Margaritaville.

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:47.520
It's a great day in Chicago.

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:48.800
If I could live that day every day.

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.000
There's only two more of them.

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:52.000
But you'll be able to do it in New York

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.360
because we're right down the street

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:54.960
from them in New York too.

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:55.460
Perfect.

01:07:55.460 --> 01:08:00.740
All right, well, Buried Treasure Volume One is in stores now.

01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:04.580
Escaped Margaritaville moving to Broadway mid-February.

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:07.140
You can go get tickets, escapedmargaritaville.com,

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:09.940
I believe is the, escapedmargaritavillemusical.com.

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:11.220
It's interesting to get those.

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:13.140
Oh, you know what else is coming up too?

01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:14.260
It's gonna be kind of fun.

01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:16.740
The new Avengers movie.

01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:17.780
Working with the Eagles.

01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:19.300
Working with the Eagles in next summer.

01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:20.820
Oh, okay.

01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:23.620
Yeah, yeah, those tickets are on sale now.

01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:25.220
I've known about it for a while.

01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:27.380
It doesn't come as a surprise for me

01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:29.060
because I've known about it.

01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:32.740
It's gonna be cool because, you know,

01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:35.780
I kind of got my big break opening for the Eagles

01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:39.780
way back when for the Hotel California tour.

01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:42.100
We became great friends and they were very instrumental

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:43.860
in me making a big leap.

01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:45.380
And so it's gonna be,

01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:47.140
we haven't played together since then

01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:48.260
and it's gonna be a lot of fun.

01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:49.860
And I think we're doing,

01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:50.660
we're doing with them,

01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:56.100
we're doing Miami, Orlando, Minneapolis,

01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:57.780
going to Minneapolis, Denver.

01:08:57.780 --> 01:08:58.580
Love Minneapolis.

01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:00.180
And I think San Francisco.

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:01.540
Yeah, it's gonna be fun.

01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:03.860
Well, next time you make it out to Cincinnati,

01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:05.860
I know I'll be there.

01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:07.220
If you want to pick me out of the crowd,

01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:10.260
I'll be the middle-aged guy in a Hawaiian shirt.

01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:14.580
So if you see that, that's me in the crowd out there.

01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:17.380
You know, I've seen like three people in Cincinnati

01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:18.020
dressed like that.

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:21.700
So can you tell me what color your shirt is?

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:22.900
Cause there'll probably be two other people.

01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:24.180
I'm the one with the huge muscles.

01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:26.340
Huge muscles.

01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:27.140
Huge muscles.

01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:28.980
Glistening muscles, glistening in the sun.

01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:30.580
Huge glistening muscles.

01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:32.660
Hawaiian shirt.

01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:34.580
Yeah, that's me.

01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:35.620
I'm gonna be looking for you.

01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:37.300
I'm gonna try to throw a pick in your direction.

01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:40.500
You're gonna have to really chuck it

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:42.100
cause I usually end up towards the back,

01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:42.660
but I'll try to push it away for you.

01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:43.620
Will you be on the lawn?

01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:46.420
You're gonna be up high, I mean, come on, come on.

01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:48.020
I know that, I know that, yeah.

01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:49.140
I've been out there.

01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:50.500
Jimmy, before we let you go,

01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:54.020
I just wanted to thank you for the most chill

01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:55.620
My Brother, My Brother and Me segment

01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:57.460
in the history of our podcast, I feel like.

01:09:57.460 --> 01:10:00.980
The most relaxing segment we've ever had on the show.

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:05.140
Well, man, you're saying I made podcast history today?

01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:05.540
There it is.

01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:06.740
Yes, absolutely.

01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:08.580
Wow, okay, well, thank you.

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:10.020
Cause I know a lot of people listen.

01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:12.900
So yeah, I know there's a reason to listen

01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:14.260
cause you guys are good.

01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:16.900
I'm glad we could finally give you your big break, Jimmy,

01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:18.180
and really get your name out there.

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:19.860
I've been looking for that thing, yeah.

01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:22.020
So thanks for allowing me to have my big break.

01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:25.300
All right, thank you, Jimmy.

01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:26.900
Okay, guys, have a great holiday.

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:29.780
Okay, Finza, bye-bye.

01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:31.380
Thank you to everybody.

01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:34.900
Thank you to Jimmy Buffett, I guess,

01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:38.340
especially for coming on and doing our show.

01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:42.260
One other quick thing I wanted to mention.

01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:44.900
I have one other small thing.

01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:47.540
Candle Nights show went on sale, sold out.

01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:50.980
Thank you so much to everybody who got tickets.

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.020
Can't wait to see you.

01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:53.620
If you didn't get tickets, or even if you did,

01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:56.900
and you wanna do something else this Candle Nights season,

01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:59.140
Big Brothers Big Sisters of South Central West Virginia

01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:04.660
works with a lot of LGBTQ youth in our area.

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:09.940
And because of that work, they lost $80,000 in donations

01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:10.740
because-

01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:12.100
People are assholes.

01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:13.300
Because people are assholes.

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:15.780
But we're not, and more importantly, you're not.

01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:17.380
So we're trying to make up the gap.

01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:20.020
All the money from the show is being donated to them.

01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:22.820
But my sister-in-law, Riley,

01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:25.220
is also organizing a fundraiser with us

01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:27.940
that is be a Candle Nights star.

01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:30.260
So basically, for five bucks or more,

01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:31.540
if you can afford it, that would be great,

01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:34.180
you can get a star on the Candle Nights tree.

01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:37.700
And that'll be up at our show this December.

01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:39.540
And all the profits for that,

01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:40.820
you can personalize your own star

01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:42.180
and all the profits for that

01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:46.980
are gonna go to the Big Brothers Big Sisters

01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:48.180
of South Central West Virginia.

01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:52.980
So if you could do that, it's bit.ly forward slash mbmbam stars.

01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:55.940
And we really appreciate that.

01:11:57.060 --> 01:11:58.020
Two more quick things.

01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:00.900
PodCon is this weekend.

01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:03.700
Hopefully you've heard about it before now,

01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:07.460
but if you haven't, in Seattle, December 9th and 10th,

01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:11.460
there's a podcast convention with my brother and my brother

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:15.140
and me, 99% Invisible, Welcome to Night Vale,

01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:19.860
Last Name Basis, and also some great guests

01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:20.660
are gonna be there.

01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:22.020
Apana and Charla's gonna be there.

01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:23.380
Gabby Dunn's gonna be there.

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:26.980
I think Hal Lublin's gonna be there.

01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:28.980
Oh, they got Hal?

01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:31.700
They got Hal, and you can attend.

01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:33.620
You can come for just $100.

01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:35.860
And even if you're not in the area,

01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:39.620
there is a $30 remote attendance option

01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:42.100
that's like being there, but you don't have to travel for it

01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:43.140
for just 30 bucks.

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:44.660
What a miracle.

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:46.100
I know, and not only were we doing it,

01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:47.620
my brother, my brother, and me there,

01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:49.620
there's gonna be a bunch of other events

01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:52.340
that we pop our heads into and do.

01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:54.900
I'm moderating a panel about collaborative storytelling

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:57.620
with some folks from Night Vale and Black Tapes

01:12:57.620 --> 01:13:00.100
and a couple other shows that I'm pretty excited about.

01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:01.380
So that'll be something.

01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:02.980
I've never moderated before.

01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:03.700
It's gonna be great.

01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:04.580
So you can check that out.

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:06.180
It's gonna be great, so you can check that out

01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:10.180
at podcon.com, P-O-D-C-O-N.com.

01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:12.740
That's this weekend, so don't wait on that.

01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:15.140
And get your questions in if you're gonna be there

01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:17.060
for the My Brother, My Brother, and Me show.

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:18.100
Please, we need those.

01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:20.420
And one more quick plug.

01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:23.060
I was on Hello from the Magic Tavern this week,

01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:25.220
which was an absolute dream of mine.

01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:26.500
It's one of my favorite podcasts.

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:27.460
If you haven't checked it out,

01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:30.020
it's one of, I think, the funniest,

01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:35.220
most inventive podcasts in existence right now.

01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:36.180
And I got to be on it.

01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:38.500
And I played a character named Chest Trunkborn.

01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:40.180
And you boys would be proud of me.

01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:42.340
I did my character voice through the whole episode.

01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:42.980
Good boy.

01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:44.420
So good.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:47.060
And like I said, that's Hello from the Magic Tavern.

01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:48.980
And I was on it this weekend.

01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:50.180
It was super fun.

01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:51.220
It was a great time.

01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:54.980
And Paul Sabourin makes a couple cameos in there too.

01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:56.340
So go check it out.

01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:58.900
I wanna say I'm sorry about all the plugs,

01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:00.980
but this time, and I know that's annoying.

01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:02.500
So thank you for hanging in there with us.

01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:04.260
A lot of his charity,

01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:06.180
and I'm not gonna apologize for that.

01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:07.060
You're all good people.

01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:09.860
And I know everybody is looking for opportunities

01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:10.980
to make the world slightly better.

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:12.260
So apologies about that.

01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:13.860
Just kind of a confluence of everything

01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:14.900
happening at all at once.

01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:15.460

01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:16.500
Got a lot of plates spinning.

01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:18.340
A lot of plates spinning.

01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:21.460
It'll be, so thank you for indulging us.

01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:21.860
We really appreciate it.

01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:23.380
Yeah, and it's not fucking over yet

01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:24.420
because I wanna thank John Roderick

01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:26.020

01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:27.060
