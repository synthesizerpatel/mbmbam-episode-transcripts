00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:47.920
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

00:47.920 --> 00:51.520
The life show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:51.520 --> 00:55.440
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your baby's brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:55.440 --> 01:01.520
Hey, was that too subtle? Try it differently. No, I'm actually worried that was too blatant.

01:01.520 --> 01:06.080
And me. No, the problem is you gotta leave that, uh, it's gotta be even more subtle, Justin,

01:06.080 --> 01:10.960
because the mystery of who the me is, is something that's permeated all of our back episodes. So if

01:10.960 --> 01:16.080
you emphasize it like that, it makes it sound like you're the me, when really, isn't everyone the me?

01:16.080 --> 01:21.440
Yeah, I like to think that the listener's the me, if you, if, at the end of the day.

01:21.440 --> 01:26.720
But that would cut one of us out of the show, Griffin. Mm-hmm. So one of us is the interloper.

01:26.720 --> 01:31.040
I see. I'm the comma. What, what do you guys want to talk about? I want to talk

01:31.040 --> 01:34.640
about Terrace House and nothing else. No, we've already talked about Terrace House.

01:34.640 --> 01:41.520
No, but see, no, no, but no, but guys, I'm late to it. So now I need everybody to rewind that clock

01:41.520 --> 01:45.920
back and let's talk about it with fresh new eyes, cause I just started watching it.

01:45.920 --> 01:52.000
Acting, start the play over. This is the, this is the penalty you pay for not taking our recommendations

01:52.000 --> 01:56.640
at face value from like the jump trap. So here's the thing, here's what I find interesting about

01:56.640 --> 01:59.360
Terrace House. No, I don't think we're gonna, we actually can't talk about what's interesting

01:59.360 --> 02:04.720
about the Japanese reality television show, Netflix original Terrace House. We unfortunately can't, oh.

02:04.720 --> 02:10.080
One, I feel like, I feel like the commentators are like a completely separate show that's running

02:10.080 --> 02:14.960
concurrently. Ah, shit, we just said yes. This is all like Whitty and Urbane. I do want to alert

02:14.960 --> 02:22.640
everybody though, that Jan one, when we all pile into the plane with the Terrace House fam and head

02:22.640 --> 02:29.120
on down to the Aloha site, this show will become only about Terrace House. 24 seven, catch up.

02:29.120 --> 02:34.880
Pretty much like completely only about Terrace House. By the way, I just want to put this plea

02:34.880 --> 02:42.080
out there again, cause I saw, I saw Griffin put the word out. If you can find some way to find

02:42.080 --> 02:49.520
some subtitled seasons of Terrace House before they, the Netflix era, that would just be a

02:49.520 --> 02:55.280
chest of delight from series one on really. There's a lot of in jokes in Terrace House,

02:55.280 --> 02:59.280
boys and girls in the city that I feel like I'm missing out on. So if you could just do that for

02:59.280 --> 03:05.440
me. And also I want to say that I am completely, I'm one, I will make myself available to be on a

03:05.440 --> 03:10.400
future season of Terrace House. Oh good. Yeah, that's what they need. Here's the thing, because I also

03:10.400 --> 03:14.960
am available to be on The Bachelorette and I know what you're thinking, but Travis, you're married.

03:14.960 --> 03:20.320
Correct. I will not be there for any dating purposes whatsoever. I will only be an in the

03:20.320 --> 03:25.760
house color commentator that's there like, I don't know about all this guys. That's all I want. You're

03:25.760 --> 03:30.560
the interloper of The Bachelorette. Yeah. They should have on one and in every season there

03:30.560 --> 03:35.120
should be one designated wing man. Right. He's just in the house like, Hey, that's all good.

03:35.120 --> 03:39.920
Have you checked Reggie? Reggie's pretty cool. Am I right? Like I've thought about doing that. I,

03:39.920 --> 03:43.520
I would love to be the merit just on The Bachelorette when like my title pops up,

03:43.520 --> 03:48.000
it just says Travis McElroy married person. And like, it'll just be me hanging out with like

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
Jojo or whatever, being like, I don't know about that guy, Joj. And it'll just be like that over

03:52.000 --> 03:56.320
and over again. I want to do that on Terrace House too, where I'm not interested in dating anyone.

03:56.320 --> 04:01.440
I'm just there for the food and the buddy ship. That's all I want. But you're not Travis, my buddy.

04:01.440 --> 04:05.680
You're my friend. There will be a, there will be a language barrier that I imagine will be

04:05.680 --> 04:10.720
significant. But I think I will also add a certain flair to the show when I sit there and go, I think

04:10.720 --> 04:14.160
that what we have here is a problem with communication. Cause I don't know what you're

04:14.160 --> 04:17.440
saying and you don't know what I'm saying. You're going, you're going to become, you're not going to

04:17.440 --> 04:21.760
be Travis the buddy. You're going to be Travis the screaming beard man. You're going to be like a,

04:21.760 --> 04:26.880
like a unintelligible troll that just stalks the house and leaves dirty dishes everywhere.

04:26.880 --> 04:30.160
Okay. That's what we'll do. I, when they, when everybody moves into the house,

04:30.160 --> 04:35.360
I'll just already be there. There'll be no explanation. And like any kind of introduction

04:35.360 --> 04:40.240
will be made impossible. And I will just like, I'll just be a mystery bearded person who just

04:40.240 --> 04:44.720
lives in the house. That's actually a great idea. Travis, I would love to see somebody pull this

04:44.720 --> 04:48.960
move. It would work on Terrace House or real world. If you're the first person to show up at the house

04:48.960 --> 04:53.920
when from the second person on just start telling him it's your house to say, it's like a new thing

04:53.920 --> 04:58.560
they're doing. We're like, oh, welcome to my abode. This is my, well, I'd rather, I'll just go ahead

04:58.560 --> 05:02.240
and pick where I'm going to sleep. Cause I do own the home. It's my home. I've lived here for 10

05:02.240 --> 05:06.800
years. So welcome to Travis's place. It's the new name of the show. They change it for Netflix.

05:07.600 --> 05:12.960
Or just like what address were you looking for? Oh no, no. This is, this is six five two.

05:13.760 --> 05:18.720
But you can live here. Do you want to stay? I just went to the store and bought some stuff.

05:18.720 --> 05:25.600
I made omurice. Um, I, it's a shame we got off on this Terrace House bit because we just can't like,

05:25.600 --> 05:30.320
we just can't get into it. Um, but also I wanted to talk about, I had an intro that I wanted to

05:30.320 --> 05:33.120
talk about, but we've gone a little bit long, so I don't know if this is the right time,

05:33.120 --> 05:42.240
but I wanted to talk at length about, um, piss because it's 12, 23 PM where I am right now.

05:42.240 --> 05:49.760
And just walking backwards, I believe 17 minutes ago, another person pissed on me and it wasn't the

05:49.760 --> 05:54.720
first time it's happened in the last 16 days. In fact, it's probably about the ninth time it's

05:54.720 --> 05:59.440
happened. Kind of that sun and mask action, the three columns, basically like the comedy classic

05:59.440 --> 06:06.400
son of mask. And that it's just, you think there's so babies are so little that their

06:06.400 --> 06:14.240
pee muscles are going to be weak, but it just go, it just go and go and go and go. It just go.

06:14.240 --> 06:18.960
He pissed and it crossed the length of his whole body and it didn't get on him at all because

06:18.960 --> 06:23.040
the pressure of the piss was so powerful, but it did. But there was, but there's

06:23.040 --> 06:30.480
piss on the blinds chair, pissed to make you a superstar is the piss, piss it up, piss it up,

06:30.480 --> 06:37.760
piss it up, piss down. But Griffin, you're talking about that common shit. Your, your tiny baby son

06:37.760 --> 06:44.880
peed on you. My tiny baby daughter peed on me. I was changing her diaper mid change. She farted

06:44.880 --> 06:52.240
while she was peeing. The pressure of the fart made her pee onto me. She peed on me. Like my

06:52.240 --> 06:59.840
baby daughter, like it was amazing. Babies are incredible. They're beautiful, beautiful. It's

06:59.840 --> 07:04.400
amazing. I don't want to, I don't want to talk about it every time my son pisses on me, but it's

07:04.400 --> 07:11.760
like, it's, it's notable to mention if, if before I had a child, another person just pissed on me,

07:11.760 --> 07:16.080
I'd be like, Hey guys, I have a crazy idea for this intro. There's crazy story of this thing

07:16.080 --> 07:21.920
that happened to me. That was completely, it was actually wet and wild. That is true. If

07:21.920 --> 07:26.880
they, like, if this were real world and I came on to this podcast one day to talk about how,

07:26.880 --> 07:31.600
like how in depth I was keeping track of someone else who lived in the house's bowel movements,

07:32.160 --> 07:36.160
like it, you would sit, you would be like, okay, Travis, well, you're off the show.

07:36.160 --> 07:39.440
What a funny intro for what a wild story.

07:39.440 --> 07:44.800
You're really interested in how often and the consistency of this other human beings poop.

07:44.800 --> 07:50.240
Well, I guess I am. Thank you for asking. Uh, listen, it's time to, that's enough

07:50.240 --> 07:56.560
bloviating about ourselves and our spawn. It's time to help real people. Here it go.

07:57.280 --> 07:59.760
Hi brothers. I have a friend who is intelligent and well-read,

07:59.760 --> 08:04.480
but for reasons unknown, she mispronounces the word pseudonym saying swayed them.

08:04.480 --> 08:17.520
Um, instead of pseudonym,

08:19.920 --> 08:24.080
I didn't correct her that first time she was pronounced. And now if I correct her,

08:24.080 --> 08:29.200
I'll just look like a jerk for saying, uh, letting her say wrong all these years.

08:30.240 --> 08:33.280
How can I let her know she's saying it wrong without coming off as a jerk?

08:33.280 --> 08:39.120
And that's from, that's not how you say it from Kentucky, which is in and of itself a swayed them.

08:40.080 --> 08:42.080
Yeah, that is a swayed them that you've used here.

08:42.080 --> 08:47.840
I do want to say, I think we have previously discussed like the idea of someone mispronouncing

08:47.840 --> 08:53.040
words, or I know very recently we talked about like a boss calling any kind of image you used

08:53.040 --> 08:58.720
on a computer a meme. Um, and so I don't think we have to go super in depth, but I will be honest,

08:58.720 --> 09:06.160
anytime anyone sends a question like this, it's so funny to me that this person has been able

09:06.160 --> 09:11.120
to survive in the world. And I, I recognize that pseudonym isn't like the most common

09:11.760 --> 09:15.520
word in the English. Like you're not saying pseudonym 20 times a day.

09:15.520 --> 09:18.400
That's what makes it so perfect. If it was a commonly used word,

09:18.400 --> 09:21.760
they would have been corrected at this point, but pseudonym is perfectly

09:21.760 --> 09:26.800
rare so that they'll drop it like once every couple months, maybe. And when they do,

09:26.800 --> 09:32.400
they fucking botch it so hard. They screw up so bad. This is the worst mispronunciation I've ever

09:32.400 --> 09:36.880
seen. There's only one way that you can handle this that I can come up with. Go two ways.

09:37.600 --> 09:42.320
One is quick and easy. Uh, the next time they say pseudonym, say, oh, you know, a fun French

09:42.320 --> 09:47.360
way of saying that nom de plume and then just switch them, switch them to nom de plume.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.680
And that would be one way. Then they never have to say pseudonym again. They just say

09:51.680 --> 09:57.040
nom de plume. The other way is you're going to have to trick someone into saying pseudonym within

09:57.040 --> 10:02.560
earshot of them. And I don't know how exactly you do that. Cause you can't say it yourself.

10:02.560 --> 10:06.960
Cause you're right. The jig will be up. But if you can trick someone into saying that word

10:07.520 --> 10:11.840
within earshot of them, that's one cool way of doing it.

10:11.840 --> 10:17.360
Ooh, Justin, may I take that one step further? May I get a hand on that ball?

10:17.360 --> 10:18.640
Yeah, please take it away.

10:18.640 --> 10:24.560
Okay. Write a little scene with like, have a plant, right? That what's going to happen is

10:24.560 --> 10:28.160
they're going to use the word pseudonym and you're going to say, uh, I think it's pronounced

10:28.160 --> 10:32.800
swayed them. And they're going to go, no, that's wrong. And you're going to go, huh? I never knew

10:32.800 --> 10:37.120
that. And you're going to do all of that within earshot. So then you're in the clear as to why

10:37.120 --> 10:41.600
you never corrected this person. Cause Hey, you didn't know either, but now the information's out

10:41.600 --> 10:46.160
there. Nobody's feelings were hurt and they get to go, Oh, I've also been put out. They're not

10:46.160 --> 10:50.080
alone in this moment. They're with you in this moment. Everybody. Yes.

10:50.080 --> 10:53.920
You jumped down into that pit because you've been there before and you know how to get out

10:53.920 --> 10:56.800
this way. I'm done with you. You get it.

10:56.800 --> 11:03.760
I'm also dumb. I'm sway dumb. Ooh, I got one. Oh, what if, Ooh, this is good. Cause this

11:03.760 --> 11:07.600
serves everybody. Everybody was with this one. Oh, good. What if throughout the show

11:08.480 --> 11:13.840
when things are on a real tear and if we get into some of our classic random humor,

11:13.840 --> 11:19.680
real, like real good stuff, like that good South Park stuff, that South Park family guy,

11:19.680 --> 11:25.120
very random humor. What if we go ahead and just try to work the word pseudonym

11:26.400 --> 11:34.000
and then you, you clip it out and you say, you have to listen to this great bit from this comedy

11:34.000 --> 11:39.360
podcast I love. And we'll just happen to say pseudonym a couple of times. And then you,

11:39.360 --> 11:43.360
that's a good conversation starter. Like, Whoa, did you see the weird way they say it? Not like

11:43.360 --> 11:49.680
we do. Maybe we should check online to get a final verdict on this. Now it's important

11:49.680 --> 11:56.400
that you erase this question from your special fucking Ridley Scott director's cut of this

11:56.400 --> 11:58.960
episode of my brother, my brother. They're going to have to snip it out and put it on

11:58.960 --> 12:04.800
YouTube or something. Yeah. Um, do you guys want to Yahoo? Sure. Yes. How about, how about this one?

12:04.800 --> 12:12.640
It was sent in by, um, it was sent in by, Oh, you know what? I didn't save who it was by.

12:12.640 --> 12:19.120
Hi. Sorry. Sorry, folks. Give me, please. Many apologies. Please wait. Please wait. It's loading.

12:19.120 --> 12:24.000
Oh, it's by, uh, climbing that ladder. Zoe Kinski riding high. Both, both honorifics. Thank you,

12:24.000 --> 12:33.520
Zoe. Yahoo answers user. Um, Randall. It's so rare that you see the full Randall and not just a

12:33.520 --> 12:39.840
partial Randy. Love that movie by the way. It's just like, it lets me know this person works so

12:39.840 --> 12:46.400
hard. You know, the sequel to the full money, Randall is actually spreading your buckle

12:49.760 --> 12:54.960
used to be to pay extra for the full Randall. Surely you're not going to go the full Randall.

12:54.960 --> 13:00.080
That's illegal in these parts. I blokes. We need more money to save the old fire house,

13:00.080 --> 13:05.520
but we've already gone the full Monty. What else is there? I know. I know gentlemen.

13:05.520 --> 13:12.240
Let's show them our insides. What the full Randall. We can't. It's against God and man.

13:13.440 --> 13:21.440
It's actually literally illegal. Yeah. And the Pope's against it too. Any in the everybody ever

13:21.440 --> 13:27.760
what everyone's United on this, aren't they? You shouldn't turn yourself inside out for your butt

13:27.760 --> 13:35.520
all. So anyway, there's only one way we're going to stop Brexit mates. That's what the full Randall.

13:37.840 --> 13:42.000
How does this help? Don't worry about it. The nice thing about them using Randall is,

13:42.000 --> 13:45.360
you know, it's not a pseudonym. Like that has to be their actual name.

13:45.360 --> 14:01.040
Him. Let's unite this kingdom again. Sports. Sorry, everybody. Sorry. Randall asks Randall

14:01.040 --> 14:12.560
asks a bad fake. Randall asks, what does it actually sound like when doves cry?

14:12.560 --> 14:19.360
I like to think that doves don't cry, but someone thinks that they do. Yeah,

14:19.360 --> 14:22.160
Prince. Is that what you're fucking talking about? Could you not pull that?

14:22.160 --> 14:27.360
This is not like an old, old saying that like can't be traced back to its origin.

14:27.360 --> 14:31.120
It's pretty, I'm just, I put this question in here because I read it and I know it's,

14:31.120 --> 14:35.280
I don't know if it's an especially rich vein, but now I read it and I couldn't stop thinking about

14:35.280 --> 14:43.440
what if the late great Prince in his song, when doves cry had been like, this is what it sounds

14:43.440 --> 14:55.200
like when doves cry. And then provided no, I mean, no, Travis is a, is a bird. So it's going to be

14:55.200 --> 15:06.000
like, I think it would be something like that. I think it might, maybe it would interrupt the flow

15:06.000 --> 15:12.640
of the song. Cause then it gets in that breakdown. It's like, and it would, it would interrupt that.

15:12.640 --> 15:19.840
There would be like a rest, a bird cry, long rest. I guess just what do you guys think it

15:19.840 --> 15:24.960
sounds like when does cry said his example, which is he thinks when birds cry, it sounds like actual

15:24.960 --> 15:29.600
human weeping. Well, he has to think of it. I always took the point of the song to be that

15:29.600 --> 15:36.000
every individual person has to find what for them is what it sounds like when does cry.

15:36.000 --> 15:42.000
Hence the word. So you would say, so this is what it sounds like when does cry because for you,

15:42.000 --> 15:47.920
if you can't just like go to like a free sound effects website and let's just type in doves

15:47.920 --> 15:52.480
crying and find it, you'll be out in the world and you'll find your moment and you'll be like,

15:52.480 --> 15:55.680
ah, okay. Right. That this is what it sounds like when does cry. Got it.

15:57.120 --> 16:02.320
Um, I, I, sorry, Justin's you have something probably be scary, right? Like kind of a,

16:02.320 --> 16:06.080
like a bird of prey kind of vibe, like a screeching hawk or something. Like,

16:06.080 --> 16:08.400
I think it's a scary sound, right? Isn't that what he's saying?

16:08.880 --> 16:17.200
Uh, uh, this Yahoo answers user choco boreal, uh, says I own a dove. That's crazy. That's wild.

16:17.200 --> 16:23.120
Okay. Here's a list of people who can own a dove. Number one, magician end of list.

16:23.920 --> 16:30.080
I own a dove and while she makes a distinct laughing noise every now and then in parentheses,

16:31.520 --> 16:37.920
no, uh, she doesn't cry when most birds, I'm assuming this was answered before 2016

16:39.760 --> 16:43.280
when most birds are in great distress in pain or being attacked,

16:43.280 --> 16:45.920
they will start screaming probably the same for doves too.

16:45.920 --> 16:52.320
Wait, hold on. Are we just going to let it slide that this person is like now? Yeah. She finds

16:52.320 --> 17:00.400
shit funny. Yeah. She watches all the episodes of Seinfeld and does the loser. Yeah. Like we

17:00.400 --> 17:04.960
watch big banks here together. I've heard her laugh. She gets it, you know, and on,

17:04.960 --> 17:09.840
on, on both levels. Cause like the jokes funny, but also that someone made a TV show in which

17:09.840 --> 17:14.880
they try to pretend like nerds are also normal people is also hilarious. So like she gets it,

17:14.880 --> 17:20.960
you know, on all levels. Um, I think that would probably murder the flow of that song.

17:20.960 --> 17:25.680
If, if it was like, this is what it sounds like when doves cry.

17:30.400 --> 17:34.000
I can't dance anymore. I stopped dancing and everybody here has stopped dancing.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.520
Well, he just have to work it in. Like Sam Cooke did it with chain gang, right?

17:37.520 --> 17:47.520
Oh, like it would just, he would just have to work. That could be good. Uh, this person also

17:47.520 --> 17:53.200
said, and person I put in quotation marks, they own birds. No, I'm just kidding. If you own a

17:53.200 --> 17:59.280
bird, that's great. Um, the other day, my dove, oh, this is sad. Sorry, everybody. The other day,

17:59.280 --> 18:04.160
my dove crushed the egg. She had been sitting on, uh, there was shell and yoke mashed, uh,

18:04.160 --> 18:08.640
into her feathers and she was shivering a bit and obviously upset with it all stuck to her.

18:08.640 --> 18:13.280
I took her inside and cleaned it up and she never made a sound. A dove's cry is silent.

18:14.880 --> 18:18.000
That might be actually the most upsetting thing we've said on the show.

18:18.000 --> 18:25.040
Or like maybe you've got one fucked up dove. Maybe that's one sick and twisted dove. She's like,

18:25.040 --> 18:28.960
no big. What time's Dr. Phil on? I got a lot of shit to do.

18:28.960 --> 18:34.640
You know what? That's true. If you heard a hue, like what, if you heard your friend Susan cry,

18:34.640 --> 18:38.720
you wouldn't be like, okay, so that's what all humans sound like when they cry. That's just

18:38.720 --> 18:44.320
what Susan saying. That's just your dove dog. Like you can't say that your dove is representative of

18:44.320 --> 18:51.920
all dogs. Yeah. This is what it sounds like when Susan cries and then Susan, uh, at this point,

18:51.920 --> 18:58.560
I'm just going to have you cry. What Prince? What? Yeah. At this point you're just going to cry.

18:58.560 --> 19:03.360
It's all part of a, it's a series of songs. I'm working on a series of customized.

19:04.400 --> 19:10.720
I can't believe I made it to the answers and you're the only holding me up. It's you,

19:10.720 --> 19:17.840
Stacy and I'm out. I just, I had to go back and get Stacey SU there's no letters at Sven.

19:17.840 --> 19:22.080
This is what it sounds like when Sven cries and then I'm done. I thought I saw it to do

19:22.080 --> 19:31.520
pseudonym, but that started with a P. So I'm, I'm at Susan now. So just cry control.

19:32.400 --> 19:38.240
What did you say? Jeremy control? Yes. Okay. I only went to the J's on my control.

19:39.840 --> 19:48.800
Prince has got a vault of music. Well, at least after his passing and it's all customized tunes

19:48.800 --> 19:58.720
to network got a party. Like it's David's third birthday and I got to do all the years for David.

19:58.720 --> 20:02.320
So David, I'm going to be here for a while.

20:05.840 --> 20:09.600
I'm also planning to do for all of the like other occasion in David's life,

20:09.600 --> 20:13.520
like David's wedding. And then I have to make it. This is what it sounds like for David and

20:13.520 --> 20:17.680
Stephanie's wedding, David and like Gloria's wedding. Cause I don't know who David's going

20:17.680 --> 20:24.000
to marry. He's three, but we'll get watermelon Chappo. Okay. Next one.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.920
What does he have to do? All the fruit and different names for hats.

20:29.120 --> 20:35.040
This is exhausting. Wait, Prince, why don't you just like include a raspberry beret with every

20:35.040 --> 20:40.720
record souls? Yeah. You know why I don't need, I don't need your input here. This is my opus.

20:40.720 --> 20:51.120
All right. Apple helmet. I'm so tired. Did you hear how many syllables I had to add to Apple?

20:51.840 --> 20:55.920
This job sucks. I hate this job. I don't know why I agreed to be Prince.

20:58.560 --> 21:05.120
Well, like my father, the Prince before me, I shall take over his mantle to finish his songs.

21:06.640 --> 21:10.080
Here's another question. I'm a dude and I have no idea how to carry coins.

21:10.080 --> 21:13.680
I used to just use my credit card for everything, but I'm trying to use cash more.

21:14.480 --> 21:21.200
Fine. It's like a weird thing to do. My wallet doesn't have a coin section. Nobody's does.

21:21.200 --> 21:26.320
Nobody's does. You invented that. And because I'm Canadian, there'd be too many coins in there

21:26.320 --> 21:32.480
anyway. Right now I carry some coins in my pocket, but I'm nervous about the sound of them. Okay.

21:33.200 --> 21:37.360
I don't drive, so I can't just put them in my car cup holder like a fucking adult.

21:37.360 --> 21:40.240
What do I do? And that's from old Jingle Pocket James.

21:40.240 --> 21:43.520
Here comes Jingle Pocket James with some good news.

21:45.680 --> 21:49.600
The first thing I want to address is I assume that the reason James feels the need to include

21:50.480 --> 21:57.600
that James is a dude is because of like purses, right? Like the assumption that were he not a

21:57.600 --> 22:00.560
dude. He could just carry a purse. Yeah, fucking get a purse.

22:00.560 --> 22:05.680
Yeah, it's 2016. Get a purse. I think everybody should have purses. I'm constantly like,

22:05.680 --> 22:10.560
oh, you know what I do now? It's a new invention. I think it just came out this year. Fanny pack.

22:11.120 --> 22:16.320
It's a good way to go. It's like a purse that never slips off your shoulder. It's just always

22:16.320 --> 22:21.120
right there about your waist, ready to hold all your bits and bobs.

22:21.120 --> 22:27.120
It's kind of bullshit, isn't it? Like, I love a nice backpack or a nice satchel. Hello?

22:27.120 --> 22:31.040
That's a purse with two straps. You wear it in a different place, dummy. Or a purse that's just

22:31.040 --> 22:35.120
like a cool holster backpack. Would you carry a briefcase?

22:35.120 --> 22:40.720
Would you carry a messenger bag? Newsflash. Those are purses. They're just weird looking purses.

22:40.720 --> 22:44.480
What's up now? That's a good point, Travis. That's a good place to put these.

22:45.680 --> 22:48.480
Canadian currency, what? They got loonies and toonies. So that's,

22:49.040 --> 22:52.560
you got, I mean, that has some power. That has purchasing power.

22:52.560 --> 22:55.040
Yeah. Because I'm with Jingle Pocket James.

22:56.640 --> 23:01.040
I'm not a big coins fan, unless it's quarters. That's all I really fuck with because quarters are

23:01.040 --> 23:06.800
are essentially little candy coupons. When I'm walking around and I see a, you know, a Gashapon

23:06.800 --> 23:10.800
and I think like, oh, good, a place to put my candy coupons. And I put them in there and I get

23:10.800 --> 23:16.640
my, my chiclets and my Skittles and what have you. It's also a cool thing to flip to a Newsy to like

23:16.640 --> 23:20.960
buy a Pape, you know, you just buy a quarter, you take your Pape. If it's less than a quarter,

23:20.960 --> 23:25.200
I throw it on the ground. Oh, well, that's not, don't do that. That's not a-

23:25.200 --> 23:29.760
No, not if they have it, first off, if they have a jar, definitely going to dispose.

23:29.760 --> 23:33.680
Like most people have a thing for people who don't want to carry change around with them.

23:33.680 --> 23:37.520
Like you could throw it in there. Sometimes there's a tip jar. That's a, that can be a little

23:37.520 --> 23:41.200
chintzy. I'd probably throw some paper money in there too. But if we're talking loonies and toonies,

23:41.200 --> 23:45.680
that's a decent, that's a decent purchasing power right there. But like, throw it in,

23:45.680 --> 23:49.760
like give a penny, take a penny. If you put a dime in there, people's eyes light up. Whoa.

23:51.040 --> 23:52.080
Look at you.

23:52.080 --> 23:57.280
You know, it's Christmas time. It's the holiday season. And so I was recently watching,

23:57.280 --> 24:04.480
I would say a McElroy family holiday favorite Scrooge with Albert Finney, 1970, I believe.

24:04.480 --> 24:09.760
And there's numerous times in the beginning in which he like reaches into his shirt and pulls

24:09.760 --> 24:16.240
out this like tiny like coin purse he's had like on like a leather, you know, band around his neck.

24:17.120 --> 24:19.280
And I'm like, hey, can we bring that, that idea?

24:19.280 --> 24:20.160
That's fucking cool.

24:20.160 --> 24:24.320
I'm just going to like secretly like open it up and pull out like a single, like, you know,

24:24.320 --> 24:31.360
one dollar coin. I think it makes you look like you're a real miser because you hoard your coin

24:31.360 --> 24:36.160
so very close to your heart. There's a story there, you know, you've been through some shit.

24:36.160 --> 24:39.120
I wish to God we could get up on dollar coins because I would love that.

24:39.120 --> 24:44.080
I would love to like fivers and tenors like go up. Give me those big coins.

24:44.080 --> 24:46.080
Give me big coins, please.

24:46.720 --> 24:50.640
Let's do it on the Japanese style. Am I right or am I right?

24:50.640 --> 24:51.280
I don't actually know what that means in this context.

24:51.280 --> 24:56.560
You go over there and you feel like you feel like some sort of brave adventurer

24:56.560 --> 25:01.920
who just turned over a chest and got a chest full of golden coins that you can use

25:01.920 --> 25:06.080
because this one's worth ten fucking dollars. Hello? Hello?

25:06.080 --> 25:10.080
That was one of my favorite things, our honeymoon in Scotland. Like the end of the day you empty

25:10.080 --> 25:14.240
out the pockets of your jeans and where normally you'd be like, oh, I've got a dollar fifty.

25:14.240 --> 25:18.240
I'd pull out a handful of coins and be like, there's twenty five dollars here.

25:18.240 --> 25:22.960
Like I have a lot of pounds here in my hand. Turns you into a walking treasure chest.

25:22.960 --> 25:26.880
Like if a Japanese RPG character came up and killed you,

25:26.880 --> 25:30.640
you just like sprout, sprout, Gil, like Gil would fall out all over.

25:30.640 --> 25:35.520
That does probably make muggings like turn out to be either very tedious or very violent.

25:35.520 --> 25:36.720
When it's like empty your pockets.

25:36.720 --> 25:39.520
You're like, OK, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink.

25:39.520 --> 25:40.720
Hold on, I'm not done yet.

25:40.720 --> 25:42.080
Clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink.

25:42.080 --> 25:44.160
Just a bunch of zinny falls out.

25:44.160 --> 25:48.800
Like here's what I'm saying, 2017 is we're still working on the title for it,

25:48.800 --> 25:53.360
but it is going to be the year where all three of us start just running for office.

25:53.360 --> 25:58.960
And my thing is going to be big old coins, big old coins.

25:58.960 --> 26:01.200
It's a job maker and a coin maker.

26:02.080 --> 26:06.320
And the way that we're going to be able to do all that is I'm going to make everything

26:06.320 --> 26:12.800
below quarters illegal and I'm going to invent like a 3D printer, like a metal molder.

26:12.800 --> 26:14.480
You remember the metal molder toy?

26:14.480 --> 26:19.600
It was like basically a forge for children and they would all burn their hands so badly

26:19.600 --> 26:21.360
like Tremaine, like Johnny Tremaine.

26:21.920 --> 26:23.760
We're going to invent something like that 3D printer.

26:23.760 --> 26:27.200
You put all your nickels and stupid dimes and ugly stinky pennies into it,

26:27.200 --> 26:29.920
and then you can make yourself beautiful metal sculptures.

26:29.920 --> 26:32.880
And then once those shitty coins are gone, make way, make way.

26:32.880 --> 26:35.600
Here comes that sack of Juiya up on the one.

26:35.600 --> 26:37.120
Here comes the five dollar coin.

26:37.120 --> 26:38.640
Here comes the ten dollar coin.

26:39.520 --> 26:40.400
Time to go to a movie.

26:40.400 --> 26:43.040
Here's a, here's two coins, a tenner and a fiver.

26:43.600 --> 26:44.960
Two coins, two coins.

26:44.960 --> 26:45.680
Dink, dink.

26:45.680 --> 26:47.440
Here, movie please, movie me.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.320
Popcorn, dink.

26:48.320 --> 26:49.120
Here's a fiver.

26:49.120 --> 26:49.760
That's it.

26:50.400 --> 26:56.320
Instead of having all this wet stinky paper in my, in my, like it's a, it's a coffin for

26:56.320 --> 27:00.240
paper that I keep near my butt and it gets wet 100% of the time.

27:00.240 --> 27:04.800
We could bring back biting coins for legitimacy because like nobody's going to bite a dime.

27:04.800 --> 27:05.520
Like who cares?

27:05.520 --> 27:07.440
I'm not going to risk tooth damage for a dime.

27:07.440 --> 27:09.520
I'll do it for fiver though, for sure.

27:09.520 --> 27:10.020
Fiver.

27:10.320 --> 27:11.280
Five dollar coin?

27:11.280 --> 27:11.680
Are you kidding?

27:11.680 --> 27:14.640
How psyched would you be if I see a five dollar bill on the ground?

27:14.640 --> 27:16.240
I think that's somebody's.

27:16.240 --> 27:18.480
I can't pick it up discreetly enough.

27:18.480 --> 27:20.080
And, and cause you know, it's embarrassing.

27:20.080 --> 27:21.760
I see a five dollar coin on the ground.

27:21.760 --> 27:24.880
I will go on a fucking quest for it.

27:24.880 --> 27:27.200
I will slay a Wyvern for you.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.240
My five dollar coin.

27:30.320 --> 27:32.560
Um, and it would be blue.

27:32.560 --> 27:33.280
Fuck yeah.

27:33.280 --> 27:34.080
Cobalt.

27:34.080 --> 27:34.720
How sick.

27:35.280 --> 27:36.000
Oh yeah.

27:36.000 --> 27:36.720
I love that.

27:36.720 --> 27:40.240
Color, fuck color coded money would be incredible.

27:40.240 --> 27:40.880
Yeah.

27:40.880 --> 27:43.920
I mean, it is everywhere else, but America where they're like,

27:43.920 --> 27:45.760
what's up thousand dollar bill.

27:45.760 --> 27:46.720
It's purple.

27:46.720 --> 27:47.600
And it's like, fuck.

27:47.600 --> 27:48.640
Yeah, it is.

27:48.640 --> 27:49.280
That's great.

27:49.280 --> 27:50.880
I want one of those so bad.

27:50.880 --> 27:51.380
I'm willing.

27:52.240 --> 27:55.680
This one's green and this one's brown and this one's metal color.

27:55.680 --> 27:56.080
Shit.

27:56.080 --> 27:56.640
America.

27:56.640 --> 27:57.440
Come on.

27:57.440 --> 28:01.600
I'm willing to go out on a, on a limb here and say that our money is the worst and the

28:01.600 --> 28:04.160
people who are in control what our money looks like.

28:04.160 --> 28:08.320
Like, like, let's, let's let me just flash back a few months.

28:08.320 --> 28:11.120
Like nobody knew who Hamilton was.

28:11.120 --> 28:15.280
And then all of a sudden Hamilton was the fucking hottest politician in town that's

28:15.280 --> 28:20.160
dead and they want to take him off the money when people started to know who he was.

28:20.160 --> 28:23.280
Like can, can we just chill out for a second?

28:23.280 --> 28:27.040
I think maybe you all don't have the best interests of everyone at heart here.

28:27.040 --> 28:29.120
I think you may be kind of winging it.

28:29.120 --> 28:32.560
I'll make it like Pokemon cards and like, there's a bunch of different people on the

28:32.560 --> 28:35.200
10 and the five and the 20 got collect them all.

28:35.200 --> 28:36.880
Like why just one print?

28:36.880 --> 28:37.440
Like a guess.

28:38.240 --> 28:39.280
Like the stamps.

28:39.280 --> 28:44.320
How stoked would you be if you're like, do you have any of the Kirk fighting Spock tens

28:44.320 --> 28:47.440
that I hear that those are not available this month?

28:48.000 --> 28:48.960
Do you have any of those?

28:50.080 --> 28:50.560
Who's on that?

28:50.560 --> 28:52.080
Who's on that $20 coin?

28:52.080 --> 28:54.160
It's Polarizer.

28:54.160 --> 28:55.360
Fuck yeah.

28:55.360 --> 28:59.040
Is this, is this, is this from the Austin Powers series?

28:59.040 --> 29:03.200
The TV series is fucking popping off.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.320
Holy shit.

29:04.320 --> 29:06.960
Eddie, the dog on a $20 coin.

29:06.960 --> 29:07.120
Yeah.

29:07.120 --> 29:10.480
I've collected the whole cast of full house and fuller house.

29:10.480 --> 29:12.000
I got them all frames.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
I'll never spend in these babies.

29:14.000 --> 29:14.480
Oh wait.

29:14.480 --> 29:20.080
This is one of the, this is one of the faulty Paul riser $20 coins because it says Paul razor.

29:20.080 --> 29:25.360
Do you see there's an a there instead of that was his extreme sports personality.

29:25.360 --> 29:29.920
It's me, Paul razor and I'm mad about shredding slopes.

29:30.480 --> 29:31.600
Oh no, wait, I'm sorry.

29:31.600 --> 29:32.880
It's, this is not a misprint.

29:32.880 --> 29:35.920
If you look, he does have little needles coming out of his face.

29:35.920 --> 29:37.840
And this was like, this was like one of like,

29:40.880 --> 29:42.720
um, so he's, he's no, he's Paul razor.

29:42.720 --> 29:43.920
Like the like hell razor.

29:43.920 --> 29:45.280
They did like a whole parody series.

29:45.280 --> 29:45.840
It was weird.

29:46.880 --> 29:49.040
Oh, this one here is Kelsey slammer.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.880
This is Kelsey grammar's extreme sports.

29:50.880 --> 29:53.440
Pernario, uh, that, what were those words?

29:53.440 --> 29:54.000
Hello.

29:54.000 --> 29:54.480
Nothing.

29:54.480 --> 29:55.760
Pernario is not a.

29:55.760 --> 29:57.120
Pernario is not a word.

29:57.120 --> 30:00.080
It's a, unless it's a, a Sweden, uh, for something.

30:00.080 --> 30:02.480
Persona gram, I think is what it, pseudonym.

30:02.480 --> 30:05.120
I don't know, but he's got his ear lobes all stretched out.

30:05.120 --> 30:06.480
That's the only thing he did different.

30:06.480 --> 30:07.040
Oh, cool.

30:07.840 --> 30:08.400
Yeah.

30:08.400 --> 30:11.200
Travis, do you have an extreme sports sitcom star?

30:11.200 --> 30:12.240
David Hyde piercer.

30:12.880 --> 30:13.120
Yes.

30:13.120 --> 30:13.840
Very good.

30:13.840 --> 30:14.480
Okay.

30:14.480 --> 30:15.440
Oh, this is fun.

30:15.440 --> 30:16.560
This is like a fun game.

30:16.560 --> 30:18.400
Now this is a good game.

30:18.400 --> 30:18.960
People are going to start.

30:18.960 --> 30:20.000
Helen hunter.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.120
It's right there.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.480
Listen, we could come up with others.

30:22.480 --> 30:24.240
So don't go fucking tweeting them at us.

30:24.240 --> 30:28.480
Like you're like, we missed one that like we could do them all day.

30:28.480 --> 30:28.720
Okay.

30:28.720 --> 30:29.760
We're not going to do that to you.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.000
Matthew Perry.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.360
You don't have to change that one.

30:33.360 --> 30:35.600
That dude's fucking extreme enough as is.

30:35.600 --> 30:35.840
Yep.

30:37.040 --> 30:38.400
Should we go to the money zone?

30:38.400 --> 30:38.720
Yep.

30:38.720 --> 30:41.680
I mean, I don't want to go to the money zone because our money's so fucking ugly.

30:41.680 --> 30:45.280
Like that's why everybody uses credit cards is I can't even bear to look at the stuff.

30:45.280 --> 30:45.600
Yeah.

30:45.600 --> 30:47.360
And we don't know where it's coming from.

30:47.360 --> 30:49.760
Like the banks are just like making it.

30:49.760 --> 30:50.240
I guess.

30:50.240 --> 30:55.760
Hey, why don't they just, hey, hey, hey, economy, how about just make some more?

30:55.760 --> 30:58.480
Just make some more money and give it out.

30:58.480 --> 31:00.160
Just give it out to everybody.

31:00.160 --> 31:03.040
We get the money and we go to the banks and we're like, hey, can we, we can trust you

31:03.040 --> 31:03.840
guys with this stuff, right?

31:03.840 --> 31:05.840
And they're like, absolutely not.

31:05.840 --> 31:09.040
It's like, all right, well, do you just take, take this ugly money anyway.

31:09.040 --> 31:11.600
But it, our ugly money means nothing.

31:11.600 --> 31:15.040
It's just pay, like I might as well be able to walk into a store with a piece of paper

31:15.040 --> 31:19.280
that says like monies on it and hand it to them and they're like, yeah, here's good stuff.

31:19.280 --> 31:20.880
Services for these garbage paper.

31:20.880 --> 31:26.640
That means nothing except we all agree that it means something, I guess, I guess maybe

31:26.640 --> 31:27.200
it does.

31:27.200 --> 31:29.840
I got a $10 coin, Paul razor's fucking face on it.

31:29.840 --> 31:33.040
And now I'm now I'm definitely going to say his name wrong for the rest of my life.

31:34.080 --> 31:34.960
I am a ruined.

31:35.600 --> 31:36.400
Well, let's go the money's up.

31:44.400 --> 31:47.760
If you had a point, if you had a point with Paul riser's face on it.

31:47.760 --> 31:49.360
Okay.

31:49.360 --> 31:55.680
Would you want modern day, older, distinguished Paul riser?

31:55.680 --> 31:58.480
Or do you want young sort of fresh mad about you?

31:58.480 --> 31:59.280
One on each side.

32:00.160 --> 32:00.480
For sure.

32:00.480 --> 32:01.120
Yeah.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.080
Call it in the air.

32:02.080 --> 32:04.240
Old Paul riser, young Paul riser.

32:04.240 --> 32:05.360
Young Paul, you're too slow.

32:05.360 --> 32:06.800
Paul riser, Paul faller.

32:07.920 --> 32:08.560
Travis.

32:09.120 --> 32:11.920
Well, I'm just saying he's crested his life experience.

32:11.920 --> 32:15.120
Not that his, not his career, but I'm just saying the arc of his life.

32:15.120 --> 32:17.360
He's headed towards death.

32:17.360 --> 32:18.320
You don't know that.

32:18.320 --> 32:19.520
I guess that's true.

32:19.520 --> 32:22.880
He's just saying Paul riser's closer to death than he is to birth.

32:22.880 --> 32:24.240
That's all Travis is saying.

32:24.240 --> 32:25.280
That's all I'm saying.

32:25.280 --> 32:26.880
How is that not true?

32:26.880 --> 32:28.800
What if Paul fucking listens to this?

32:28.800 --> 32:32.160
I mean, I also want to say Paul riser might be 40.

32:32.160 --> 32:33.200
I have no idea.

32:33.200 --> 32:34.640
How old is Paul riser?

32:34.640 --> 32:35.680
He's 59 years old.

32:35.680 --> 32:36.640
I'm looking at Alexa.

32:37.600 --> 32:40.080
How does Paul riser Alexa?

32:40.080 --> 32:42.560
Give me the precise data, which Paul riser will die.

32:43.600 --> 32:45.760
Paul riser refuses to have an age.

32:45.760 --> 32:49.280
What Paul riser will die.

32:49.280 --> 32:51.040
Whenever you wish, master.

32:51.040 --> 32:51.520
Whoa.

32:51.520 --> 32:52.400
Damn Alexa.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.120
Calm down.

32:53.120 --> 32:53.680
Go down.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.520
Someone talk about wine.

32:57.520 --> 32:59.120
I've hacked into his car.

32:59.120 --> 32:59.840
What Alexa?

32:59.840 --> 33:00.960
Don't know.

33:01.760 --> 33:02.720
Please make this.

33:02.720 --> 33:04.160
I can make this shit turn.

33:05.040 --> 33:08.000
All to make this shit do a 90 degree turn going so fast.

33:08.000 --> 33:08.960
Alexa, please don't.

33:08.960 --> 33:10.400
He was in mad about you.

33:10.400 --> 33:11.920
I loved him in whiplash.

33:11.920 --> 33:12.960
I thought he was amazing.

33:12.960 --> 33:14.400
Please don't whiplash.

33:14.400 --> 33:16.080
Please don't kill Paul riser.

33:16.080 --> 33:18.240
You want me to give Paul riser whiplash?

33:18.240 --> 33:19.760
No, that is not what I said.

33:19.760 --> 33:22.160
Alexa, Alexa, Alexa.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.800
Sorry about wink.

33:24.800 --> 33:25.120
Yes.

33:26.160 --> 33:30.640
Wink is a really good place to get all your good, good wine.

33:30.640 --> 33:33.760
Talking about wink, it's spelled W-I-N-C.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.800
Not the way like you do with your eye

33:36.800 --> 33:38.800
when you're like flirting with a sexy person

33:39.600 --> 33:41.120
or you're telling like a great joke

33:41.120 --> 33:42.800
to somebody secretly across the room.

33:42.800 --> 33:44.880
Wink is built on sort of the idea

33:44.880 --> 33:48.000
that finding good new wine is kind of difficult.

33:49.440 --> 33:52.400
And that's why we've told you about Club W in the past.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.680
You've heard us talk about Club W.

33:53.680 --> 33:55.680
They send you wine personalized to your palate

33:55.680 --> 33:57.200
and they deliver it right to your door.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.440
Well, Club W is now wink, W-I-N-C.

34:00.320 --> 34:02.080
They've got a new name and an improved look,

34:02.080 --> 34:04.720
but it's still the same amazing wine company

34:04.720 --> 34:07.440
introducing you to new wines that you are gonna love.

34:07.440 --> 34:09.360
They work directly with winemakers and growers

34:09.360 --> 34:11.440
from all over the world to create delicious wines

34:11.440 --> 34:13.040
and deliver it right to your door.

34:13.040 --> 34:15.120
They've got a 100% satisfaction guarantee,

34:15.120 --> 34:17.120
meaning if you don't like a bottle that they send you,

34:17.120 --> 34:19.280
they will replace it with a bottle that you're gonna love,

34:19.280 --> 34:20.160
no questions asked.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.200
And it's not just random bottles.

34:23.200 --> 34:26.240
They offer a personalized wine membership

34:26.240 --> 34:28.800
that recommends wine specifically for you

34:28.800 --> 34:32.160
based on the results of your profile quiz.

34:32.160 --> 34:34.960
The best part is wink is offering our listeners $20 off

That's Tryw-I-N-C.com slash my brother.

34:59.200 --> 35:00.720
I would like to tell you about Casper.

35:01.760 --> 35:04.000
I would also like to say hopefully at this point

35:04.000 --> 35:08.080
you've listened to our Casper sponsored sleep extravaganza

35:08.080 --> 35:10.080
that we published in the middle of last week.

35:10.080 --> 35:12.960
But if you haven't, Casper, well,

35:12.960 --> 35:15.680
they're an amazing online retailer of premium,

35:15.680 --> 35:17.760
obsessively engineered mattresses.

35:17.760 --> 35:19.840
But here's the catch for a fraction of the price.

35:19.840 --> 35:20.880
That's not really a catch.

35:21.440 --> 35:22.400
I realize that now.

35:22.400 --> 35:22.960
It's not a catch.

35:22.960 --> 35:23.760
It's a good thing.

35:23.760 --> 35:25.360
And catch is usually a bad thing.

35:25.360 --> 35:26.240
And here's the catch.

35:26.240 --> 35:28.080
No, it's like a baseball game.

35:28.080 --> 35:29.200
Like you made the big catch.

35:29.200 --> 35:30.080
Good job.

35:30.080 --> 35:30.720
Oh, okay.

35:30.720 --> 35:31.680
Ooh, thank you.

35:32.560 --> 35:34.880
I will say that over the last couple of weeks

35:35.440 --> 35:38.640
we have a Casper mattress both like in our bedroom

35:38.640 --> 35:42.240
and also on the day bed in our nursery.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.320
And Teresa and I have been switching off sleeping on that

35:44.320 --> 35:45.360
to be in the room with the baby

35:45.360 --> 35:47.920
so the other one gets an uninterrupted night of sleep.

35:47.920 --> 35:48.640
And I'll tell you,

35:49.200 --> 35:51.600
even when you're getting woken up every three hours

35:51.600 --> 35:53.120
to feed a baby,

35:53.120 --> 35:56.640
the Casper mattress is really delivering a good night's sleep.

35:56.640 --> 35:57.920
I'm a big fan of it.

35:57.920 --> 35:58.880
And I'm not just saying that

35:58.880 --> 36:00.080
because they're sponsors of the show.

36:01.280 --> 36:02.960
But it also is just great pricing.

36:02.960 --> 36:03.760
Like I said before,

36:03.760 --> 36:05.920
you can get a twin size mattress for $500

36:05.920 --> 36:08.320
and a king size mattress for only $950,

36:08.320 --> 36:10.080
which if you've ever been mattress shopping,

36:10.080 --> 36:11.920
you know is a great deal.

36:11.920 --> 36:14.080
And they have a risk-free trial and return policy.

36:14.080 --> 36:16.960
You can try sleeping on a Casper for up to a hundred days

36:16.960 --> 36:18.960
with free delivery to the US and Canada

36:18.960 --> 36:20.080
and painless returns.

36:20.960 --> 36:23.040
And all of those mattresses are made in America.

36:23.040 --> 36:24.080
So go check it out.

36:24.640 --> 36:26.560
And you can get $50 towards any mattress

36:26.560 --> 36:30.000
by going to Casper.com at slash my brother

36:30.000 --> 36:31.840
and use the coupon code my brother,

36:31.840 --> 36:33.120
all one word at checkout,

36:33.120 --> 36:34.560
terms and conditions apply.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.320
I want to read this dope email real quick

36:36.320 --> 36:39.360
that we got about the Casper sleep experience

36:39.360 --> 36:41.760
a special episode that we released last,

36:41.760 --> 36:43.200
what, Thursday, I think,

36:43.200 --> 36:44.880
which if you haven't listened to is it was,

36:44.880 --> 36:46.960
it was very, very fun and very quiet.

36:47.520 --> 36:51.120
Joe DeWolfe sent this one in and Joe said,

36:51.120 --> 36:52.720
hi brothers, I was a little confused

36:52.720 --> 36:54.320
as to why you made a special episode

36:54.320 --> 36:55.760
to help people fall asleep

36:55.760 --> 36:57.920
because that's what I thought every episode was for.

36:57.920 --> 36:59.040
All the best, Joe.

36:59.680 --> 37:00.720
Boo-yah!

37:00.720 --> 37:01.520
Zing!

37:01.520 --> 37:03.680
Zing!

37:03.680 --> 37:04.720
Ripped us up.

37:05.760 --> 37:07.600
We got torn up.

37:07.600 --> 37:08.480
That's brutal.

37:09.200 --> 37:10.000
It's savagery.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.920
I got a message for Lilo

37:12.800 --> 37:14.160
and it's from the gung-go gang.

37:15.520 --> 37:17.120
Watch out Lilo, they're coming for you.

37:17.920 --> 37:19.760
They're coming to steal your treasure.

37:20.320 --> 37:22.800
Happy birthday to our favorite aunt.

37:23.360 --> 37:24.960
According to your aunt lifespan,

37:24.960 --> 37:25.920
you should be dead,

37:25.920 --> 37:28.560
but against all odds, you are 17.

37:28.560 --> 37:30.880
We all pitched in some dollars to make this happen.

37:30.880 --> 37:31.520
Joke's on you.

37:32.320 --> 37:34.320
We bet you thought we didn't get you a gift.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.320
Well, this is just a prank.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.080
A little joke for our aunt friend.

37:38.080 --> 37:40.560
Happy birthday to our favorite aunt

37:40.560 --> 37:41.920
from us and the McElroys.

37:43.200 --> 37:45.120
And it actually says this is good.

37:45.120 --> 37:46.560
It asks the preferred timeframe

37:46.560 --> 37:47.920
and it says next available

37:47.920 --> 37:49.760
since I already missed the actual birthday

37:49.760 --> 37:51.680
and the longer we wait, the funnier it is.

37:53.280 --> 37:53.840
Accurate.

37:55.120 --> 37:56.480
I just Googled gung-go,

37:56.480 --> 38:00.720
which is a, the Shono word for clitoris.

38:01.520 --> 38:03.520
Oh, okay, cool.

38:03.520 --> 38:07.520
Probably not, probably not that.

38:07.520 --> 38:08.080
Probably not that.

38:08.080 --> 38:09.840
No, but it is good that now you've ruined

38:09.840 --> 38:11.840
this group of friends nickname for themselves, Griffin.

38:11.840 --> 38:12.640
Good job.

38:12.640 --> 38:15.360
That's a service I offer here at the Jumbotron.

38:15.360 --> 38:16.480
Thanks for the money.

38:16.480 --> 38:19.040
You mean clitoris, is what you said.

38:19.040 --> 38:20.880
And that's from the clitoris gang.

38:23.040 --> 38:23.760
I do want to say to you,

38:23.760 --> 38:27.440
because I just want to go on record as saying this.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.080
Like we mentioned, I think last week,

38:30.720 --> 38:32.880
all the Jumbotrons for my brother,

38:32.880 --> 38:34.320
my brother and me and the Adventure Zone

38:34.320 --> 38:36.160
for 2017 are sold out.

38:36.720 --> 38:39.120
We get on average, I don't know,

38:39.120 --> 38:41.520
three to five emails a week saying,

38:41.520 --> 38:43.600
hey, how do I get a message on the show

38:43.600 --> 38:46.160
for my significant other, for my friend,

38:46.160 --> 38:47.360
for my sibling?

38:48.560 --> 38:52.480
Unfortunately, that's not going to be possible for 2017.

38:52.480 --> 38:55.600
And it's not something we like, people, I don't know.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.360
Maybe we haven't clarified this in a long time.

38:57.360 --> 39:00.320
People have like, they've paid money to buy these

39:00.320 --> 39:01.360
as presents for people.

39:01.360 --> 39:02.880
This is not just a nice thing

39:02.880 --> 39:04.640
that we do for people who email us.

39:04.640 --> 39:06.080
Sure, but I also want to point out

39:06.080 --> 39:07.840
that like statistically speaking,

39:07.840 --> 39:10.160
we'll probably launch like three or four new podcasts

39:10.160 --> 39:10.640
next year.

39:10.640 --> 39:11.920
So there'll be more real estate for you.

39:11.920 --> 39:12.720
You'll be fine.

39:13.280 --> 39:14.960
I want to tell you about a podcast

39:14.960 --> 39:17.280
and it's called Moderately Funny.

39:17.280 --> 39:19.360
You can find them on iTunes or Podcast Addict

39:19.360 --> 39:21.680
if you're on Android or visit their webpage

39:21.680 --> 39:23.360
at moderatelyfunnypodcast.com.

39:24.480 --> 39:26.960
I did originally read that as Podcast Addict

39:26.960 --> 39:28.800
if you're am Android.

39:28.800 --> 39:29.600
Yeah.

39:29.600 --> 39:30.880
Either one works.

39:30.880 --> 39:32.720
This is their words and it's pretty great.

39:32.720 --> 39:34.960
After listening to all the top podcasts

39:34.960 --> 39:37.920
and realizing that we were funnier than any of them,

39:37.920 --> 39:39.280
we decided to start our own.

39:39.280 --> 39:41.440
Imagine how we felt when we heard your podcast

39:41.440 --> 39:42.800
for the first time and realized

39:42.800 --> 39:44.800
we were only the second funniest?

39:44.800 --> 39:46.480
The answer is not good.

39:46.480 --> 39:48.960
It is what it is though, but we know our place.

39:48.960 --> 39:51.280
That's why everyone should definitely listen to us.

39:51.280 --> 39:52.800
They should definitely listen to our show,

39:52.800 --> 39:55.040
but only if they are caught up on the bim bam.

39:55.040 --> 39:56.720
But seriously, we're funny.

39:56.720 --> 39:58.080
I'm about to run out of characters.

39:58.080 --> 39:59.760
So before I do, I just want to say...

39:59.760 --> 40:02.480
End of message.

40:02.480 --> 40:03.280
End of message.

40:03.280 --> 40:04.400
End of advertisement.

40:05.840 --> 40:08.960
And yeah, so go to moderatelyfunnypodcast.com.

40:08.960 --> 40:10.960
This is a pretty funny description,

40:10.960 --> 40:12.560
but again, only if you are caught up

40:12.560 --> 40:14.240
on my brother, my brother, and me.

40:14.240 --> 40:15.040
You know what's smart?

40:15.040 --> 40:17.360
If you go to moderatelyfunnypodcast.com,

40:17.360 --> 40:20.160
there's a sample of the show for people to listen to

40:20.160 --> 40:21.440
if they like it or not.

40:21.440 --> 40:23.760
Man, we should do something like that, huh?

40:23.760 --> 40:26.160
We used to have a sampler.

40:26.160 --> 40:31.680
We have a sampler on YouTube from like 2004.

40:31.680 --> 40:34.080
And it's just like, President Bush, right?

40:35.440 --> 40:36.960
Can you, if you're listening to this,

40:36.960 --> 40:38.080
just make one, please?

40:38.080 --> 40:38.960
No, come on.

40:39.600 --> 40:40.880
Well, maybe you already have one.

40:40.880 --> 40:42.000
Don't make one just for this.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.920
But if you've already made a my brother,

40:43.920 --> 40:45.280
my brother, and me sampler

40:45.280 --> 40:47.120
just because maybe you were bored,

40:47.120 --> 40:48.160
send it on over.

40:48.160 --> 40:49.680
But don't put it on YouTube

40:49.680 --> 40:51.680
because we gotta get them clicked.

40:51.680 --> 40:53.200
That's ours.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.720
That's our material.

40:54.720 --> 40:55.920
We'll see you in court.

40:57.440 --> 40:59.280
From the dawn of time,

40:59.280 --> 41:01.840
one podcast has unlocked the secrets

41:01.840 --> 41:03.760
of science and technology

41:03.760 --> 41:06.000
to enrich the lives of billions.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.400
And now, after a year where they've unlocked

41:08.400 --> 41:10.400
the golden age of knowledge,

41:10.400 --> 41:12.400
they're about to hit warp speed

41:12.400 --> 41:13.920
and go stratospheric.

41:13.920 --> 41:14.720
Wait, hold up.

41:15.360 --> 41:16.720
On Ono, Ross, and Kerry,

41:16.720 --> 41:18.560
we don't make extraordinary claims.

41:18.560 --> 41:19.840
We investigate them.

41:19.840 --> 41:20.880
We go undercover

41:20.880 --> 41:22.480
with fringe religious groups,

41:22.480 --> 41:24.240
investigate paranormal claims,

41:24.240 --> 41:25.280
and we participate

41:25.280 --> 41:27.200
in pseudoscientific medical treatments

41:27.200 --> 41:29.200
and then report our findings to you.

41:29.200 --> 41:31.200
And yes, we've even investigated

41:31.200 --> 41:32.160
Scientology.

41:33.600 --> 41:35.040
New episodes every month

41:35.040 --> 41:37.200
at MaximumFun.org.

41:37.200 --> 41:38.960
Ono, Ross, and Kerry.

41:38.960 --> 41:40.960
They show up so you don't have to.

41:41.760 --> 41:42.800
I have a Yahoo here

41:42.800 --> 41:44.000
sent in by Nicholas Potter.

41:44.000 --> 41:44.880
Thank you, Nicholas Potter.

41:44.880 --> 41:46.640
It's by Yahoo Answers user

41:46.640 --> 41:49.600
Jerell who asks,

41:49.600 --> 41:51.840
what is it about professional wrestling

41:51.840 --> 41:53.600
that makes you want to become one?

41:54.560 --> 41:56.240
For me, I love communicating

41:56.240 --> 41:57.360
with strangers around the world,

41:57.360 --> 41:58.480
and that's a big part of wrestling

41:58.480 --> 41:59.680
when talking on the microphone

41:59.680 --> 42:00.880
before a match during a show.

42:01.440 --> 42:02.480
Millions of people watching

42:02.480 --> 42:03.360
will know your work

42:03.360 --> 42:04.960
and will want to see you everywhere.

42:04.960 --> 42:06.000
Of course, it requires

42:06.000 --> 42:07.040
a lot of physical activity

42:07.040 --> 42:08.080
in regards to an actual match,

42:08.080 --> 42:09.920
but I think I can do it

42:09.920 --> 42:11.120
just from learning the basics

42:11.120 --> 42:12.000
with the proper training,

42:12.000 --> 42:12.640
hitting the ropes,

42:12.640 --> 42:14.000
the footwork when circling

42:14.000 --> 42:14.640
around your opponent,

42:14.640 --> 42:16.160
the flipping around and bumping,

42:16.160 --> 42:17.440
which helps with the grapples

42:17.440 --> 42:18.720
and submission moves, etc.

42:20.560 --> 42:21.760
So I guess for the two of you boys,

42:21.760 --> 42:22.720
the question I would like to ask

42:22.720 --> 42:24.160
is what is it about professional wrestling

42:24.160 --> 42:26.400
that makes you want to become one?

42:26.400 --> 42:28.640
Well, can I start off by saying

42:28.640 --> 42:30.320
that if the reason you want to become

42:30.320 --> 42:31.360
a professional wrestler

42:32.080 --> 42:34.160
is because you get to talk

42:34.160 --> 42:35.200
into a microphone,

42:36.720 --> 42:38.320
there's other opportunities to do that

42:38.320 --> 42:39.440
that don't involve

42:39.440 --> 42:40.640
all of that physical stuff

42:40.640 --> 42:42.000
you then listed after that.

42:42.640 --> 42:44.640
Have you guys ever had the thought

42:44.640 --> 42:49.200
that if it weren't for the physical things,

42:49.200 --> 42:51.600
you could be a pretty good pro wrestler?

42:51.600 --> 42:52.000
Yes.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.400
I'm saying like if you didn't have,

42:54.400 --> 42:55.680
I understand there's a lot

42:55.680 --> 42:56.640
and it's not fake

42:56.640 --> 42:57.840
because people really get hurt

42:57.840 --> 42:59.760
and it's very physically taxing

42:59.760 --> 43:00.640
and thank you for everything

43:00.640 --> 43:01.680
you all have done to your bodies.

43:01.680 --> 43:05.280
But I'm saying if it didn't require any of that,

43:05.280 --> 43:06.320
I feel like I could get like

43:06.320 --> 43:08.240
if it was just like getting the crowd

43:08.240 --> 43:09.840
sort of riled up

43:09.840 --> 43:11.600
and shooting promos

43:11.600 --> 43:13.280
about how many kick somebody's butt.

43:13.280 --> 43:15.200
See the promos aren't that shit, yeah.

43:15.200 --> 43:17.200
Yeah, I feel like I could do a good job.

43:17.200 --> 43:18.400
I would like to pitch myself

43:18.400 --> 43:19.680
as a professional wrestler

43:20.880 --> 43:22.800
and I would like to frame it

43:22.800 --> 43:24.080
like the Incredible Hulk

43:24.080 --> 43:25.360
and here's what would happen.

43:25.360 --> 43:26.960
I would be the one who would get up

43:26.960 --> 43:28.720
and talk in the microphone, right?

43:28.720 --> 43:29.520
And I would be the one

43:29.520 --> 43:30.640
who did all the promos

43:31.680 --> 43:34.720
and then I would like climb under the stage

43:34.720 --> 43:36.560
or I get into some kind of box

43:36.560 --> 43:38.000
and then who's that coming out of it?

43:38.000 --> 43:40.320
It's like a bigger, stronger version of me

43:40.320 --> 43:42.080
who's not as articulate

43:42.080 --> 43:43.840
but he's in super good shape

43:43.840 --> 43:45.680
and he's ready to do all the actual fighting.

43:46.240 --> 43:47.840
My only thing I would insist on there

43:47.840 --> 43:49.680
is that they can't have a beard

43:49.680 --> 43:50.880
because I do want them

43:50.880 --> 43:52.240
to have to like struggle

43:52.240 --> 43:54.400
with a fake beard the entire match.

43:54.400 --> 43:55.280
I want that to be like

43:55.280 --> 43:56.320
checking their spirit gum

43:56.320 --> 43:57.760
should be like a patented move.

43:57.760 --> 44:00.960
What I love is the idea of

44:01.920 --> 44:03.840
Jimmy John's offers

44:05.040 --> 44:07.600
a special off the menu sandwich

44:07.600 --> 44:09.760
that when you eat it, Travis,

44:09.760 --> 44:11.760
you transform Turbo Teen style

44:11.760 --> 44:13.040
into Brock Lesnar,

44:13.040 --> 44:15.920
the biggest and hungriest man ever to live.

44:15.920 --> 44:17.840
He is hairless like a dolphin

44:19.280 --> 44:22.080
and he is just made of

44:22.080 --> 44:26.640
he's made of like a millimeter thin layer of skin

44:26.640 --> 44:28.800
and then just all blood inside of that.

44:30.800 --> 44:33.120
And so that you eat the Jimmy John's sandwich

44:33.120 --> 44:34.000
and then like a trap door

44:34.000 --> 44:35.200
and the ring opens up

44:35.200 --> 44:36.000
and you fall through

44:36.000 --> 44:37.360
and then Brock pops up

44:37.360 --> 44:40.000
and it's like, oh, here's the big man himself.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.880
He's back again. Travis ate the forbidden sandwich

44:42.880 --> 44:44.080
and now he's ready to rumble.

44:44.080 --> 44:45.120
See that's good.

44:45.120 --> 44:47.280
Is that honestly the greatest

44:47.280 --> 44:49.360
strong person name ever?

44:49.360 --> 44:50.160
Is that a pseudonym

44:50.160 --> 44:52.480
or is that like actually his name?

44:54.480 --> 44:55.840
Yeah, I think that's his Christian.

44:55.840 --> 44:57.200
That's his name is Travis McElroy.

44:57.200 --> 44:58.240
Brock Lesnar.

44:58.240 --> 44:59.440
Yeah, his real name is Travis.

44:59.440 --> 45:00.960
Here's what I like about this.

45:00.960 --> 45:02.160
This gives you

45:02.160 --> 45:03.360
like something to struggle against.

45:03.360 --> 45:04.400
Like I go to eat the sandwich.

45:04.400 --> 45:05.920
They knock the sandwich out of my hand.

45:05.920 --> 45:08.640
Oh no, I'm having to get away from

45:08.640 --> 45:09.920
the only name that's coming to mind

45:09.920 --> 45:11.280
is Brutus the barber beefcake.

45:11.280 --> 45:12.560
I think he's out of the game

45:12.560 --> 45:13.920
but I'm trying to get away from him

45:13.920 --> 45:15.280
before he cuts my hair

45:15.280 --> 45:17.120
and like, oh, I gotta get to that sandwich.

45:17.120 --> 45:18.160
I gotta get to that sandwich.

45:18.160 --> 45:19.360
But Paul Bearer

45:19.360 --> 45:21.440
who I actually think is passed from this world

45:21.440 --> 45:22.800
he's grabbing the sandwich.

45:22.800 --> 45:23.920
Now I'm jumping over the rose

45:23.920 --> 45:25.440
but I have to get back in in time

45:25.440 --> 45:27.920
if I remember from WWE SmackDown

45:27.920 --> 45:28.960
the video game

45:28.960 --> 45:30.160
that I have to get back in

45:30.160 --> 45:32.000
before time counts down or I'm out.

45:32.560 --> 45:34.480
And so I'm trying to get that sandwich back from

45:34.480 --> 45:35.280
and then I get it

45:35.280 --> 45:37.040
and I just as like they're about to get me

45:37.040 --> 45:38.720
I roll under the stage to eat the sandwich.

45:38.720 --> 45:42.800
Boom, Travis, Brock Lesnar, McElroy, he's out.

45:42.800 --> 45:43.920
He's back out there like,

45:43.920 --> 45:45.680
oh, we shouldn't have let him get that sandwich.

45:46.320 --> 45:48.720
Now, now I'm on top, right?

45:48.720 --> 45:50.240
But then they try to eat the sandwich

45:50.240 --> 45:52.960
but Brock Lesnar just slams it in one bite

45:52.960 --> 45:54.400
and he gets even more powerful

45:54.400 --> 45:56.720
because the more he eats, the stronger he gets.

45:57.280 --> 45:58.480
I was on a wrestling podcast

45:58.480 --> 45:59.520
once and I was asked this question.

45:59.520 --> 46:01.840
I've had a lot of time to develop my character

46:01.840 --> 46:04.320
and mine would sort of be like the Pokemon Ditto

46:04.320 --> 46:06.800
where I would just like perfectly mimic

46:06.800 --> 46:08.240
everybody else's moves.

46:08.880 --> 46:10.080
And so like I would get in there

46:10.080 --> 46:11.040
and I would fight against,

46:11.040 --> 46:12.640
I would fight against the Undertaker

46:12.640 --> 46:13.840
only I would be,

46:13.840 --> 46:15.280
I would like do the same,

46:15.280 --> 46:17.440
literally the same exact entrance as him.

46:17.440 --> 46:18.240
And I would get in there

46:18.240 --> 46:19.600
and he's a nine foot tall man

46:19.600 --> 46:21.680
but I would still choke slam him like,

46:21.680 --> 46:23.360
now I'm the Undertaker now.

46:23.360 --> 46:24.160
And I would always,

46:24.160 --> 46:25.200
the thing about my character is

46:25.200 --> 46:26.800
I would always win every fight.

46:27.520 --> 46:29.040
And people wouldn't like me very much.

46:29.040 --> 46:29.760
They'd be like,

46:29.760 --> 46:31.520
this is not gonna be a match up very much.

46:31.520 --> 46:32.800
Like here comes John Cena

46:32.800 --> 46:34.560
and also Griffin Cena.

46:34.560 --> 46:38.240
And I think your outfit should always be

46:38.240 --> 46:40.640
a copy of theirs but a very bad one.

46:40.640 --> 46:41.040
Yes.

46:41.040 --> 46:42.720
Like construction paper.

46:43.360 --> 46:45.920
It'll very much be like Kirby in Smash Brothers

46:45.920 --> 46:47.360
where I will run into the ring.

46:47.360 --> 46:49.680
I will very briefly swallow John Cena

46:51.280 --> 46:53.840
and pass him and pass him.

46:53.840 --> 46:54.320
Spin him out.

46:54.320 --> 46:55.520
But then like when I spin him out,

46:56.320 --> 46:57.440
I'm wearing a little hat

46:57.440 --> 46:58.080
and it's backwards

46:58.080 --> 46:59.040
so I've got some wrist cuffs

46:59.040 --> 46:59.520
and I'm not,

46:59.520 --> 47:00.240
I don't have a shirt

47:00.240 --> 47:01.760
and my jeans are off of the knees.

47:01.760 --> 47:03.440
Justin, can I pitch it?

47:03.440 --> 47:05.120
I have an idea for a wrestling presenter for you

47:05.120 --> 47:06.480
and I want you to tell me what you think of this.

47:07.280 --> 47:10.560
The pacifist and your wrestler believes

47:10.560 --> 47:12.480
that the only way to win is to not fight.

47:12.480 --> 47:14.320
And also you have a pacifier.

47:15.520 --> 47:16.080
Okay.

47:16.880 --> 47:17.600
That's very,

47:17.600 --> 47:19.600
and I try to get the pacifier in their mouth.

47:19.600 --> 47:20.080
Yeah.

47:20.080 --> 47:21.120
And if you do,

47:21.120 --> 47:22.720
they have to immediately stop fighting

47:22.720 --> 47:23.360
and you win.

47:23.360 --> 47:25.040
I probably,

47:25.040 --> 47:26.640
I do think it would be a good wrestling move

47:26.640 --> 47:27.600
to lay on the ground

47:27.600 --> 47:28.880
because if you've ever tried

47:28.880 --> 47:31.120
to pick somebody up

47:31.120 --> 47:32.480
who's just laying on the ground

47:32.480 --> 47:33.280
and it ain't easy

47:33.280 --> 47:35.040
and you can't pin somebody on their thumb,

47:35.040 --> 47:36.960
that's not legal.

47:36.960 --> 47:37.920
That's a good point, Justin.

47:37.920 --> 47:38.800
I haven't thought about this.

47:38.800 --> 47:39.120
This is a good character.

47:39.120 --> 47:42.800
Oh, and also your skin is cold and clammy.

47:42.800 --> 47:45.360
I think that a good strat would be

47:45.360 --> 47:47.440
like a good character would be

47:47.440 --> 47:49.440
if you just didn't,

47:49.440 --> 47:50.800
like, you know how every time they do

47:50.800 --> 47:52.080
any kind of wrestling move,

47:52.640 --> 47:54.320
like both people have to work together

47:54.320 --> 47:55.840
to pull it off to make it safe.

47:56.400 --> 47:57.440
My character would be like,

47:57.440 --> 47:58.640
I just wouldn't help out.

47:58.640 --> 48:00.160
Like I'm gonna choke slam you off the top rope,

48:00.160 --> 48:01.360
get in position.

48:01.360 --> 48:03.040
I'd be like, fuck that, no.

48:03.040 --> 48:04.160
No, try it.

48:04.160 --> 48:05.600
I won't let you do that to me.

48:05.600 --> 48:06.960
Try it, tough guy.

48:06.960 --> 48:08.880
Yeah, try to do it to me for real.

48:08.880 --> 48:10.160
How far would you get?

48:11.280 --> 48:12.880
How far would you get in wrestling

48:12.880 --> 48:14.800
if your whole thing was just like,

48:14.800 --> 48:17.280
no, I think I'm just gonna try to beat him up.

48:17.280 --> 48:17.840
I think.

48:21.280 --> 48:22.720
I hear what you're saying, Vince,

48:22.720 --> 48:24.000
and I'm loving all of it.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.440
I can totally see the drama,

48:25.440 --> 48:27.200
but here's my unique spin.

48:27.200 --> 48:29.360
I think I'm just gonna go try to beat him up

48:29.360 --> 48:30.880
with my fists and muscles.

48:30.880 --> 48:32.400
It's like a new thing I'm working on.

48:33.200 --> 48:33.920
Irish whip you,

48:33.920 --> 48:35.200
and you're supposed to run into the ropes

48:35.200 --> 48:36.480
and then come bounce back.

48:36.480 --> 48:37.760
They would throw me towards the ropes,

48:37.760 --> 48:39.520
and I would just kind of stop and be like,

48:41.920 --> 48:42.560
because I do this,

48:42.560 --> 48:44.240
and then you're gonna hit me with your arm.

48:44.240 --> 48:45.840
And I'm not interested in that.

48:47.040 --> 48:48.640
I want to beat you up.

48:48.640 --> 48:50.960
That's my thing.

48:50.960 --> 48:53.040
I was reading in the script here that I lose,

48:53.040 --> 48:54.640
but let me offer,

48:54.640 --> 48:55.360
I have a different,

48:56.320 --> 48:58.480
what if I win?

48:58.480 --> 49:02.320
What if I beat him up instead of him beating me up?

49:02.320 --> 49:04.480
Call me the improviser.

49:04.480 --> 49:05.680
That will be my whole deals.

49:05.680 --> 49:07.680
They'll never see where I'm coming from.

49:07.680 --> 49:09.040
I'm the real fighter.

49:14.880 --> 49:18.400
But also, I do have to reiterate,

49:18.400 --> 49:19.840
this character would be me

49:20.560 --> 49:23.040
with my own current human body.

49:23.040 --> 49:25.840
So like, it would be a real extra.

49:25.840 --> 49:30.240
What if your special skill was,

49:30.240 --> 49:32.080
you had an invisible barrier

49:32.080 --> 49:33.760
that was an inch outside of your body.

49:33.760 --> 49:36.000
So anytime anyone else tried to hit you,

49:36.000 --> 49:37.280
they couldn't do it,

49:37.280 --> 49:38.480
but you could hit them.

49:38.480 --> 49:40.320
That would be the character I would want to play.

49:40.880 --> 49:42.160
You're saying,

49:42.160 --> 49:44.800
I try to enforce an imaginary force field.

49:46.080 --> 49:46.960
If they touch me,

49:46.960 --> 49:49.120
they have violated my unique fiction.

49:50.480 --> 49:51.760
Who's that coming down the ramp?

49:51.760 --> 49:52.880
It's Magic Jerry.

49:52.880 --> 49:54.080
What's up guys?

49:54.080 --> 49:55.440
Shazam, you're dead.

49:55.440 --> 49:56.800
Zip, zip, zap, zip, zip, zap.

49:57.920 --> 50:00.720
John Cena has died from some sort of magic.

50:01.360 --> 50:03.520
Hey, I did a hadouken.

50:03.520 --> 50:04.640
You're supposed to fall.

50:04.640 --> 50:05.600
Look at my hands.

50:05.600 --> 50:06.960
That's a hadouken.

50:06.960 --> 50:07.840
Everybody saw it.

50:09.040 --> 50:11.920
Magic Jerry just yelled yoga fire

50:11.920 --> 50:13.520
and Ryback is on the ground.

50:13.520 --> 50:14.720
We're all very worried about it.

50:17.920 --> 50:18.800
Here's another question.

50:18.800 --> 50:20.400
There's this guy I used to be friends with,

50:20.400 --> 50:22.880
but we haven't spoken regularly in a couple of years.

50:22.880 --> 50:25.760
I guess they just use silly voices and stuff.

50:25.760 --> 50:28.800
I honestly didn't even know him that well

50:28.800 --> 50:29.840
when we were in contact,

50:29.840 --> 50:31.760
but for some inexplicable reason,

50:31.760 --> 50:35.840
he always texts me right after he has sex with someone,

50:35.840 --> 50:37.600
tells me about it in vivid detail,

50:37.600 --> 50:39.360
and then does not contact me again

50:39.360 --> 50:40.880
until the next time he bones down.

50:41.600 --> 50:42.960
Why did he choose me for this?

50:44.080 --> 50:45.600
How can I get it to stop?

50:45.600 --> 50:47.120
Please, God, can someone help me?

50:47.120 --> 50:48.960
And that's from Nasty in Nashville.

50:48.960 --> 50:50.400
All right, you dirty bird.

50:50.400 --> 50:51.360
Let me tell you something.

50:51.360 --> 50:53.280
You can block someone on your phone.

50:53.280 --> 50:56.800
So newsflash, you like it.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.120
You like it.

50:59.120 --> 51:00.800
I don't think we should put this ball

51:00.800 --> 51:01.680
in this person's court.

51:01.680 --> 51:02.640
You should block them,

51:02.640 --> 51:03.520
because this is weird,

51:03.520 --> 51:05.440
but the question stands.

51:05.440 --> 51:06.800
Why were you chose?

51:08.080 --> 51:09.360
What was it about me?

51:10.400 --> 51:12.480
What is it about you that they were like,

51:12.480 --> 51:13.760
oh, I know who would like this.

51:15.040 --> 51:15.600
Steven.

51:17.360 --> 51:19.520
You're saving his phone as Nasty Steven.

51:19.520 --> 51:22.560
Steven, not just that Steven will like this,

51:22.560 --> 51:24.480
but that Steven needs this.

51:24.480 --> 51:27.200
Consistently, Steven needs to know.

51:28.640 --> 51:31.360
I want Steven to not worry about whether or not

51:31.360 --> 51:33.280
I'm able to bone on the reg,

51:33.280 --> 51:34.640
or also maybe just like,

51:35.200 --> 51:37.280
I think Steven really needs to know

51:37.280 --> 51:40.640
the ins and outs of this whole situation.

51:41.360 --> 51:44.880
Yeah, damn, that's a good point.

51:44.880 --> 51:46.880
Or maybe it's a curse situation

51:46.880 --> 51:49.920
where it's like you said to this person,

51:49.920 --> 51:54.960
like, I bet you don't ever get any of that good.

51:54.960 --> 51:58.960
I bet you've never had the full Randall before.

51:59.840 --> 52:01.600
And they say, oh, is that true?

52:02.320 --> 52:03.120
Interesting.

52:03.120 --> 52:05.040
And then they did a curse on your phone.

52:05.040 --> 52:07.280
Maybe now every time they do have sex,

52:07.280 --> 52:11.360
that when you gave this person your phone number,

52:11.360 --> 52:12.400
as they were in on it,

52:12.400 --> 52:15.280
did they say anything like nice finally got one

52:15.280 --> 52:17.280
or my first one?

52:17.840 --> 52:20.640
And maybe you're the only contact they have in their phone.

52:20.640 --> 52:22.720
So they're just trying to get it out there.

52:22.720 --> 52:24.720
Oh, so, and like the friend that introduced you

52:24.720 --> 52:26.800
to this friend was like, I'm free.

52:26.800 --> 52:30.080
And Randall follows.

52:33.120 --> 52:35.600
Maybe you get, maybe you're getting BCC

52:35.600 --> 52:36.400
and you don't realize it.

52:36.400 --> 52:37.440
And this person just shouts.

52:37.440 --> 52:38.800
And they don't know it either.

52:38.800 --> 52:40.160
And they're so embarrassed.

52:40.160 --> 52:42.080
They just shout to the whole, no, they know.

52:42.080 --> 52:43.120
They're like, I did it.

52:43.120 --> 52:45.200
Gotta tell everybody on my phone.

52:48.560 --> 52:50.240
You're saying that this isn't a targeted message.

52:50.240 --> 52:51.520
This is no, it's going out.

52:51.520 --> 52:52.560
It's going out to Steve.

52:52.560 --> 52:52.960
It's going out.

52:52.960 --> 52:54.240
It's a newsletter.

52:54.240 --> 52:56.080
It's going out to mom home.

52:56.080 --> 52:57.520
It's going out to mom work.

52:57.520 --> 52:58.960
It's going out to dominoes.

52:59.520 --> 53:01.280
It's going out to fifth street dominoes.

53:08.160 --> 53:08.960
I got a Yahoo.

53:08.960 --> 53:10.080
We can jump too.

53:10.080 --> 53:11.840
Yeah, real quick though.

53:11.840 --> 53:14.160
Real quick from Drew Davenport, level 9,000.

53:16.560 --> 53:17.040
Thank you, Drew.

53:17.040 --> 53:17.920
It's by Yahoo answers user.

53:17.920 --> 53:18.880
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

53:18.880 --> 53:19.840
I'm going to call this person.

53:20.480 --> 53:24.720
Sheamus asks who would win in a fight?

53:25.520 --> 53:31.520
One Godzilla sized pug, one million pug sized Godzilla's

53:31.520 --> 53:34.400
or Kevin from home alone.

53:36.960 --> 53:38.480
I think we can deal with this one pretty quickly.

53:38.480 --> 53:40.240
It's such a good question, right?

53:40.240 --> 53:44.560
It's that one horse sized duck or 10 duck sized horses

53:44.560 --> 53:45.440
or something like that.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.440
But this one takes it up a notch.

53:47.440 --> 53:51.200
One Godzilla sized pug, one million pug sized Godzilla's.

53:51.200 --> 53:52.400
Let's just say you deal with that.

53:52.400 --> 53:53.840
You think that over for so long.

53:53.840 --> 53:56.160
Like get small Godzilla's that could still fuck shit up.

53:56.160 --> 53:57.520
But a big pug could just step on them.

53:57.520 --> 53:59.120
But then also Kevin is there.

53:59.680 --> 54:01.920
Okay, so if it's a one to one, okay.

54:01.920 --> 54:05.760
So if it's a one to one, the Godzilla,

54:05.760 --> 54:10.480
if it's a one to one pugs, the Godzilla sized pug

54:10.480 --> 54:15.600
would I think be consumed like piranha style

54:15.600 --> 54:19.360
by the large number of Godzilla's.

54:19.360 --> 54:22.640
The tiny Godzilla's could overwhelm him almost instantly.

54:22.640 --> 54:24.880
Especially he says pugs are not inherently

54:25.440 --> 54:27.440
bloodthirsty vicious creatures.

54:27.440 --> 54:29.040
Counterpoint, they don't need to be.

54:29.040 --> 54:31.360
This is a dog the size of a fucking building.

54:31.360 --> 54:34.480
Just by moving around, I will say they're energetical obese.

54:34.480 --> 54:36.320
And so they will run around and scamper around.

54:36.320 --> 54:41.120
And in doing so, they will destroy scores of Zillas

54:41.120 --> 54:41.760
with each step.

54:41.760 --> 54:43.840
But then Kevin's there.

54:45.520 --> 54:48.080
I think whoever wins the first contest

54:48.080 --> 54:50.400
will then immediately kill and eat Kevin

54:50.400 --> 54:51.840
because he's a child.

54:51.840 --> 54:54.480
He's a little child and he doesn't have superpowers.

54:55.120 --> 54:56.560
No one gave him any pain.

54:56.560 --> 54:59.520
He's just a child and he would get immediately consumed.

54:59.520 --> 55:04.320
I would like to throw in a counterpoint.

55:05.280 --> 55:09.120
I think if we assume that one Godzilla sized pug

55:09.120 --> 55:12.080
is an equal match for how many was it?

55:12.080 --> 55:12.580
10,000?

55:13.280 --> 55:14.560
A million, right?

55:14.560 --> 55:16.240
A million is tricking me up.

55:16.240 --> 55:18.400
Okay, well, let's say that however many

55:18.400 --> 55:21.520
makes an equal match for a Godzilla sized pug, right?

55:22.160 --> 55:24.640
Now, Kevin is just one tiny flesh boy,

55:25.360 --> 55:28.880
but he's gonna tip the balance of whatever side

55:28.880 --> 55:30.080
he decides to join.

55:31.840 --> 55:34.400
So I would say that his best course,

55:34.400 --> 55:36.640
if we're talking about this Sun Tzu style,

55:36.640 --> 55:40.000
it's his best course is to ally with either one of them.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.560
I would go with the Godzilla sized pug myself

55:42.560 --> 55:44.320
so you could ride it Falcor style,

55:45.200 --> 55:49.600
but you side with him and then you let him be weakened

55:49.600 --> 55:53.600
by the X amount of pug sized Godzilla's.

55:53.600 --> 55:55.680
Then you turn on him at the end

55:55.680 --> 55:57.920
because you are still fresh from the fight

55:57.920 --> 55:59.440
and you are able to take him down.

55:59.440 --> 56:00.480
But if we're talking about-

56:00.480 --> 56:01.440
In what reality?

56:01.440 --> 56:04.880
What exact, okay, you can't just say take him down.

56:04.880 --> 56:07.440
Even if he's a bruised and battered,

56:07.440 --> 56:10.560
he's still Godzilla sized and he's a tiny boy.

56:10.560 --> 56:13.120
Like I don't care how many fucking Tonka trucks

56:13.120 --> 56:16.240
he puts in front of this thug, he's a giant dog.

56:16.240 --> 56:17.600
He's gonna kill and eat him.

56:17.600 --> 56:19.680
Who wins in a fight, Justin?

56:20.480 --> 56:22.480
Kevin from Home Alone with all of his traps

56:22.480 --> 56:25.600
and his deviousness or Matthew Broderick?

56:25.600 --> 56:28.080
Because Matthew Broderick has killed Godzilla

56:28.080 --> 56:30.080
and all of Godzilla's children.

56:30.080 --> 56:34.000
So what's it look like?

56:35.680 --> 56:39.760
Well, Kevin's got all his traps.

56:39.760 --> 56:42.160
I also wanna say, Griffin, just no spoilers.

56:42.160 --> 56:44.000
He doesn't kill all of Godzilla's children.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.440
There's still one in the locker room.

56:45.440 --> 56:46.400
Shit, you're right.

56:46.400 --> 56:49.520
Let's credit where credit is due.

56:49.520 --> 56:53.040
Yeah, I think the only shot Kevin has in this conflict

56:53.040 --> 56:56.720
is to go into the basement and wait.

56:57.360 --> 57:01.520
And as he listens, the million Godzilla,

57:03.040 --> 57:05.760
tiny Godzilla's will eat everybody else

57:06.560 --> 57:08.080
and then they'll leave.

57:08.080 --> 57:11.440
And then, cause they'll have to keep eating like a shark

57:11.440 --> 57:15.360
and then he can maybe come out later after a few years.

57:15.360 --> 57:16.640
To a blighted world.

57:16.640 --> 57:18.960
To a blighted world and then say like,

57:18.960 --> 57:20.800
I guess I'm still here.

57:20.800 --> 57:25.840
And then just as he's having this moment of amazing triumph,

57:25.840 --> 57:28.480
he'll drop his talk boy and it'll break

57:28.480 --> 57:30.800
and he'll be like, no, not now.

57:30.800 --> 57:33.440
Yeah, now I truly am home alone.

57:35.040 --> 57:35.520
He'll say.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.920
And he has to repopulate the earth

57:39.920 --> 57:42.880
with Buzz's girlfriend, the wolf.

57:42.880 --> 57:44.640
Yeah, it could be the sequel to Home Alone 2

57:44.640 --> 57:47.440
lost in New York and it'd be Home Alone 3, New York is lost.

57:47.440 --> 57:52.000
And for that joke to work, you have to do what I do,

57:52.000 --> 57:53.920
which is pretend that Home Alone,

57:53.920 --> 57:55.440
anything after Home Alone 2 doesn't exist.

57:56.240 --> 57:56.480
Yes.

57:58.480 --> 57:59.600
Should we wrap up?

57:59.600 --> 58:02.800
Yeah, let's finish this delightful episode.

58:02.800 --> 58:03.840
They should have made,

58:03.840 --> 58:05.760
they need to make a new Home Alone 2 now,

58:05.760 --> 58:08.720
but combine Home Alone and like the White House down movies,

58:08.720 --> 58:11.440
but like Kevin trying to protect the White House

58:11.440 --> 58:12.880
from like international terrorists

58:12.880 --> 58:14.720
and he's trying to save the president.

58:14.720 --> 58:15.840
Fuck, I would watch that.

58:15.840 --> 58:17.040
Why isn't that real?

58:17.040 --> 58:18.240
They could get Charlie Hunnam.

58:18.240 --> 58:23.200
I would buy that actually if it was like Home Alone 6

58:24.240 --> 58:26.400
and it's Charlie Hunnam as a grownup Kevin McCallister

58:26.400 --> 58:28.160
trying to save the president with traps.

58:28.160 --> 58:30.320
Don't mind if I do enjoy that film.

58:30.320 --> 58:31.360
Thank you very much.

58:31.360 --> 58:31.600
Right?

58:32.800 --> 58:33.440
Is it too late?

58:33.440 --> 58:34.400
Can we make that?

58:34.400 --> 58:35.120
Hollywood.

58:35.120 --> 58:37.440
Yo, Hollywood, make me that please.

58:37.440 --> 58:40.160
Can Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci be the terrorist leaders,

58:40.160 --> 58:40.800
I guess?

58:40.800 --> 58:42.480
Yes, yes they can.

58:43.120 --> 58:44.080
Yeah, they're in there.

58:44.080 --> 58:45.040
They're in the mix.

58:45.040 --> 58:46.400
I think Daniel Stern would be in,

58:46.400 --> 58:48.080
I think he would, I think he'd sign on.

58:48.080 --> 58:49.440
Pesci might be a bigger get.

58:50.160 --> 58:51.360
Oh, no, no, no.

58:51.360 --> 58:54.160
Pesci and Stern are the two that like Kevin

58:54.160 --> 58:56.800
like has to turn to like to work with.

58:56.800 --> 58:57.600
Yes, the team up.

58:57.600 --> 58:58.160
Fuck yes.

58:58.160 --> 58:58.880
Are you kidding me?

59:00.000 --> 59:03.840
Are you, I'm fucking so in love with this movie.

59:03.840 --> 59:06.640
They're like elderly and he has to go to them

59:06.640 --> 59:08.000
and be like, one more job.

59:08.720 --> 59:12.320
Just to break into the White House together as a team up.

59:12.320 --> 59:13.440
Are you kidding?

59:13.440 --> 59:14.560
We're not gonna help you kid.

59:14.560 --> 59:15.760
We're gonna kill you.

59:15.760 --> 59:17.040
Guys, it's ISIS.

59:18.240 --> 59:18.560
Okay.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.600
Listen, I may be a dirty crook,

59:21.600 --> 59:25.440
but I'm a red blooded American through and through.

59:25.440 --> 59:26.400
Let's do this.

59:27.920 --> 59:30.080
The patriotic bandits right again.

59:30.080 --> 59:32.240
The patriotic bandits this time.

59:32.240 --> 59:34.320
And we got a third member and it's Kevin.

59:34.320 --> 59:37.120
And then at the end, they do try to kill him,

59:37.120 --> 59:39.680
but they can't because he's Kevin McAllister

59:39.680 --> 59:41.680
and he had traps ready for them.

59:41.680 --> 59:41.920
Yeah.

59:42.560 --> 59:44.560
Oh, he was looking for that double cross.

59:44.560 --> 59:45.920
Fuck yes.

59:45.920 --> 59:47.360
Oh, make it.

59:47.360 --> 59:48.720
We need this now more than ever.

59:50.320 --> 59:50.720
Shit.

59:50.720 --> 59:52.240
I want this movie.

59:52.240 --> 59:53.520
I want this movie.

59:53.520 --> 59:54.560
I want this movie.

59:54.560 --> 59:56.720
What's Brenda Fricker gonna do?

59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.240
Oh, she teams up with Snow Shovel Man.

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.440
They're working together.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:05.520
Snow Shovel Man is there with Brenda Fricker

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:06.400
at the last minute.

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.840
They fused into one magic old person.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.800
This seems kind of gross at first,

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:15.360
but then they turn out to be completely normal and nice.

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:15.920
Fuck yeah.

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:17.280
Shit.

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:20.720
And then Brenda Fricker turns into doves.

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.640
She just turns into pigeons.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.400
Yeah, it turns into like a John Woo movie

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:27.040
with Brenda Fricker like throwing doves at them.

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:29.280
Long dead doves.

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:34.160
Shit.

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:35.280
Shit.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:35.600
Okay.

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:36.000
Shit.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:36.480
So anyway.

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:37.280
Good movie.

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.000
Good movie.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.680
It's a good movie that exists now.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.760
I mean, we've basically spoken it into existence.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.840
Thank you to everyone who has kicked in gifts

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.040
to the MBMBAM Angels campaign for the year.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.640
You all are doing an amazing job.

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:55.600
If you don't know, here's like the very, very brief version.

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:59.040
We are trying to help out people in our area

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.520
who aren't gonna have much of a holiday without you,

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.640
our beloved listeners.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:06.720
There's a list of people at MBMBAMangels.com

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:10.080
that you can choose one and you send them things.

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.960
You can do Amazon, just send gifts to help

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.600
and you claim them off the list and you feel great

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.520
and you help people who really need it.

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.960
And you all rise to the challenge every year.

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:23.120
And this year was our biggest list ever.

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:25.200
It felt like by a country mile

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.880
and everybody's just like crushing it.

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:28.960
What I love is, and a lot of people know about this,

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.160
we've been doing it for a while,

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:31.680
but I don't know if everybody knows the backstory

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:34.720
and that this was a thing that like the newspaper used to do.

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:36.080
And then like-

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:36.800
And they still help.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.440
They still help.

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.080
And they still help.

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:40.960
Yeah, definitely, but like our audience just ate it up.

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:44.000
Our audience was like, you know, this is ours.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.800
Like a million pug-sized Godzillas.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:47.920
Yeah, just consumed it

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.480
like a million Godzilla-sized Kevin Arnolds.

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:53.360
Hey, hold on, not Kevin Arnolds.

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:54.800
That's another one, isn't it?

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.960
I can buy, you can buy gifts on there

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:59.840
or you can just kick in some cash if you wanna do that

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:01.600
because they're trying to buy big ticket items

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:04.080
like people don't have beds and ovens

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:09.520
and it's really depressing until you decide that you can fix it.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:12.640
And you can, you can fix this.

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.400
Go to my bim bam angels.com

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:17.360
and let's get those final 15% done.

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.760
I was gonna say right now,

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:22.240
we are also participating in World Builders,

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:25.360
which is a charity that was started by Patrick Rothfuss.

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:29.360
It benefits Heifer International, Mercy Corps,

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:33.040
and First Book, you know, helping people out.

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:37.680
And we're, I think we're, this week I think is the end of it.

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:40.800
I'm not sure, but right now we've already raised

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:45.680
over $1,500 through the Mbem Bambinos World Builders Group.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:47.920
And for every $10 you donate,

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:50.640
you get entered into a lottery to win cool stuff

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:53.760
and you get to be a part of the Mbem Bambino team.

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:58.720
So if you wanna go to bit.ly forward slash M-B-M-B-A-M-W-B,

01:02:58.720 --> 01:02:59.600
you can check that out.

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:02.240
We're also participating in some live streams

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.520
with Patrick this week.

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:04.960
Not sure what time this will go up,

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:06.400
but if it goes up in time,

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.960
we're doing one at 2 p.m. Eastern,

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:10.240
and we'll tweet about that.

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:14.400
And then I'm also doing one on Wednesday at 5 p.m. Eastern,

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:15.840
talking about like mental health

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.760
and how important it is to take care of yourself.

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.120
And we'll tweet that link as well.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
And yeah, go check it out, support a good cause.

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:25.440
I wanna thank John Roderick in the long winters

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:26.320
for these sort of theme song.

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.400
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.240
It is a wonderful, wonderful album

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.480
and a great holiday time present

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.800
for a loved one or for yourself.

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:35.600
It's really good.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:37.760
I guarantee you're gonna love it.

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:39.120
Also wanna thank Maximum Fun for having us.

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:40.400
You can go to maximumfun.org

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.040
and just start clicking on shows and listening to them,

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:45.440
like the Beef and Dairy Network and Jordan Jesse Go!

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.520
and Throwing Shade and One Bad Mother.

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:49.360
There's a ton of good shows that you can find all in there.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:50.640
If you wanna find other stuff that we do,

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:52.480
you can go to mcroyshows.com

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:55.120
and find all of the various podcasts and video series

01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:57.200
and all of our Twitters and addresses

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.520
and all kinds of fun stuff all there.

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:02.640
We are gonna be doing a Candle Nights episode

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.240
here in a couple of weeks or so.

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:07.200
So please get in your Candle Nights themed questions.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.200
Oh, Griffin, you mentioned gifts.

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:14.160
We haven't mentioned in a while maxfunstore.com

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:17.600
has merch from all kinds of different Max Fun shows,

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:18.880
including My Brother, My Brother and Me.

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:20.800
I think there's probably still time to get self-ordered

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:22.080
and get it in time for Christmas.

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:24.560
But if not, you can always hand them a piece of paper

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.000
that says, I owe you.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.560
It says, I owe you one t-shirt.

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:31.600
But go check out maxfunstore.com

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:33.040

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:33.840
You said Max Fun.

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:36.880
That reminded me, I was on another Maximum Fun podcast

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:39.680
called Still Buffering this week to talk about video games.

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.400
And it was a lot of fun.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:45.120
And you can find that wherever fine podcasts are sold.

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.400
Still Buffering.

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:51.520
It's a good show about being a teen that anybody can enjoy.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:52.640
That's it for the episode.

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:53.600

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:57.440

01:04:58.480 --> 01:04:59.360
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.720
This website fucking sucks.

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:05.520
I'm gonna say their name is Jason.

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:06.640
Jason, what is he?

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:12.160
Asks, I heard that if you get a Taco Bell tattoo,

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:13.840
they will give you fee food for life.

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:14.560
Is this true?

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:17.600

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:27.200
Square on the lips.
