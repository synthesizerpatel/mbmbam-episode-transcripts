00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.960
Hello, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm your

00:48.960 --> 00:55.840
oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby

00:55.840 --> 01:01.760
brother, 30 under 30 Griffin McElroy. Now, Travis, I'm looking at the show notes that you submitted

01:01.760 --> 01:08.720
for potential items of discussion for the opening of the show, and it says here,

01:09.520 --> 01:16.160
you like a Taka Dino? I would like a Taka Dino, Justin. Hey Griffin, you like a Taka Dino?

01:16.880 --> 01:25.360
I like a Taka Dino. It let's Taka Dino. I'll Taka Dino one second, Travis. I'd like to Taka Dino

01:25.360 --> 01:32.240
with you. Ah, yes, thank you. Let me Taka Dino for just a second. I watched, finally saw that new

01:33.120 --> 01:38.880
Jurassic Park 2. The second one that did come out like this year and is kind of relevant.

01:38.880 --> 01:47.120
Yeah, Jurassic Park 2 slash 5, depending on how you're counting them. And let me tell you

01:47.120 --> 01:54.720
something, they're added again. Yeah. I need to know how, listen, I have respect for all

01:54.720 --> 02:01.440
of the creatures of Earth. I think that, and there's an undercurrent in the Jurassic Park films

02:01.440 --> 02:11.840
of these are animals and they should be respected. I would argue that they were created because of

02:11.840 --> 02:17.840
man's meddling. They are the children of men and we may deal with them as we wish. They are the

02:17.840 --> 02:24.000
products of our hubris. God has nothing to do with them. They are our products. So why, at the

02:24.000 --> 02:34.320
beginning of Jurassic Park, I guess five? Why is the first scene not President Barack Obama 2,

02:34.320 --> 02:39.120
Jr., Barack Obama's son, because it's in the distant future. Why is the first thing that

02:39.120 --> 02:46.960
happens not the president saying, kill all these fucking dinosaurs. Hey, everybody, kill every

02:46.960 --> 02:52.960
dinosaur. We're not doing it anymore. Everybody kill all the dinosaurs. You can't have them.

02:52.960 --> 02:59.760
How are we so good at extincting tens of thousands of species every year, but we can't wipe out

02:59.760 --> 03:04.000
these fucking dinosaurs. I would like to remind everyone that we live in- Guys, I'm sorry,

03:05.440 --> 03:13.360
just the doorbell rang, sorry. Oh, guys, John Hammond. He's come to claim. He heard us talking.

03:13.360 --> 03:22.080
I spared no expense in doxxing you, Griffin. It's a bag of dog poop. I left it upon your stoop.

03:22.080 --> 03:28.640
I gave you a flaming dog poopy bag. That's T-Rex poop. I heard you talk a dino.

03:28.640 --> 03:33.200
You should talk a nicer dino, Griffin. Did you ever have a flea circus?

03:34.400 --> 03:42.560
I've had six. Spared no expense. Griffin's still gone, eh? He's been crystallized in amber.

03:43.440 --> 03:46.640
Okay, I will talk about this because Griffin's not here, so I get to talk about it.

03:46.640 --> 03:52.640
Okay. John Hammond says the first attraction he made when he came to America from Scotland

03:53.840 --> 04:01.360
was a flea circus, right? Can you imagine how bored you have to be to see an old man playing

04:01.360 --> 04:08.160
with a tiny circus and be like, I would love to pay some money to watch this old man play with

04:08.160 --> 04:14.720
this tiny pretend circus. He's just on a corner? Like, what is he doing? All right, I'm back.

04:14.720 --> 04:16.880
He's back. We're talking about John Hammond's flea circus.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.320
John Hammond's flea circus, Griffin.

04:18.320 --> 04:20.400
Wait, were you guys doing the podcast without me?

04:20.400 --> 04:21.680
We were, just a little bit.

04:21.680 --> 04:22.640
What the fuck?

04:22.640 --> 04:26.880
There was definitely lacking something, so I'm so glad you're here. John Hammond said he came over

04:27.680 --> 04:31.280
from Scotland. The first attraction that he had was a flea circus.

04:31.280 --> 04:32.000
Right.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
So here's what I'm trying to figure out. Did you just walk up on a corner and see all John Hammond

04:38.560 --> 04:43.200
playing with a pretend circus on a corner and he's like, wait, if you're gonna keep watching

04:43.200 --> 04:46.960
me play with this pretend tiny circus, you're gonna have to give me a quarter.

04:46.960 --> 04:47.200
Right.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.560
Because this is business.

04:48.560 --> 04:53.600
And that happened eight billion times until he had four billion dollars.

04:53.600 --> 04:57.040
And then a wealthy investor with a monocle did come up and say like,

04:57.040 --> 05:00.560
this would be cool. Have you thought about doing it with dino sours?

05:00.560 --> 05:07.440
This is the thing that really floored me watching JWFK, is that me, Travis Vagra,

05:07.440 --> 05:14.240
I live in a world in which once we cloned a sheep and people talked about that motherfucker

05:14.240 --> 05:22.800
for like 10 years. And in JWFK, everyone has acclimated to the fact that there are now

05:22.800 --> 05:27.440
dinosaurs super quickly. Everyone's just like, yeah, I get it.

05:28.720 --> 05:34.720
I'm over dinosaurs. But like, yeah, me too. Doesn't that parallel us as the audience?

05:34.720 --> 05:41.680
When Stevie Spielberg first unloaded his boat full of beautiful robot dinosaurs,

05:41.680 --> 05:46.800
we all lined up at the shore to wave our hankies at them. These conquering heroes.

05:46.800 --> 05:52.480
Give us your thunder lizards, Stevie. They look so real. And now Stevie's back for a

05:52.480 --> 05:55.920
fifth time with a fifth boat that has Chris Pratt as the captain of it.

05:55.920 --> 05:59.120
And we're like, is Deadpool on there somewhere?

05:59.120 --> 05:59.440
We need him.

05:59.440 --> 06:03.520
Because if not, we need a different boat. You're gonna need a bigger boat with even

06:03.520 --> 06:05.200
an angrier dinosaur on it.

06:05.200 --> 06:08.320
To the point where, here's how bored everyone is with dinosaurs.

06:09.200 --> 06:15.680
And I mean the audience. That Jurassic World has to make up new dinosaurs.

06:15.680 --> 06:19.840
They gotta keep getting more visceral. We're so bored of these fucking dinosaurs.

06:19.840 --> 06:21.840
They gotta, the next one, they gotta get like,

06:22.560 --> 06:26.240
they have to have abs and dicks and stuff to like-

06:26.240 --> 06:30.800
Listen, these dinos fuck. There's one thing we can all agree on.

06:30.800 --> 06:36.240
They can get it. And they do. The last thing was that they're bored of dinosaurs so they

06:36.240 --> 06:39.200
make a bigger, angrier dinosaur that can kill more people.

06:39.200 --> 06:41.600
And you're telling me they do that again?

06:41.600 --> 06:41.920
Yes.

06:42.640 --> 06:47.120
You know what fucking stinks? That park looked dope.

06:47.120 --> 06:50.400
They had roller coasters and fun attractions that didn't have

06:50.400 --> 06:54.640
shit to do with these killer, awful monsters that I'm so bored of.

06:54.640 --> 06:58.880
Get some abs and dicks and butts and, you know, expose-

06:58.880 --> 07:01.040
You know what I mean? Something to really catch the eye.

07:01.040 --> 07:03.760
But there were fun roller coasters for thrill seekers like me

07:03.760 --> 07:06.560
who don't want to be eaten by big dinosaurs.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.760
You could clone Abraham Lincoln and have him at your park.

07:09.760 --> 07:11.360
I think that'd be pretty cool too.

07:11.360 --> 07:11.760
Like-

07:11.760 --> 07:13.200
Okay, wait. Stop.

07:13.840 --> 07:19.280
You understand that you would need to get a sample of Abraham Lincoln's blood, right?

07:19.280 --> 07:19.600
Yes.

07:20.640 --> 07:24.160
Is that really harder than getting a dinosaur's Justin?

07:24.160 --> 07:26.320
Because Abraham Lincoln was around more recently.

07:26.320 --> 07:30.240
I bet you could find a mosquito that ate on Abraham Lincoln

07:30.240 --> 07:32.640
and then got frozen in some carbonite or whatever.

07:32.640 --> 07:38.560
Find a bayonet down Gettysburg that has a bit of president blood on it.

07:38.560 --> 07:42.320
From his great fight he did at Gettysburg,

07:42.320 --> 07:45.120
we led the troops and stabbed like nine dudes.

07:45.120 --> 07:46.640
Definitely got stabbed in return.

07:46.640 --> 07:49.040
Find that one. We got ourselves an Abe Bruin.

07:49.040 --> 07:51.120
Or what if just a random dude?

07:51.120 --> 07:55.200
Like, I'm sorry. I think that would be enough of an attraction if you're just like,

07:55.200 --> 07:59.920
this is, you know, Sam and this is Sam B and this is Sam C

07:59.920 --> 08:02.320
and like we just cloned Sam over and over again

08:02.320 --> 08:07.680
and you can come to Samrassic Park and see like it's all Sams everywhere.

08:07.680 --> 08:12.240
You know what'd be dope is if instead of tightening up the security protocols of the Jurassic Park,

08:12.240 --> 08:16.080
if they just got a little clone DNA sample from every visitor who came in.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.640
And then if you get all led up by a Stegosaur,

08:18.640 --> 08:22.080
then it's fine because your heart will go on in this new clone.

08:22.080 --> 08:26.560
You're taking this to full Black Mirror territory and I love it.

08:26.560 --> 08:28.560
I think what you should do is say like,

08:28.560 --> 08:32.720
I am going to get killed at Jurassic Park,

08:32.720 --> 08:35.760
so let me go ahead and get this clone a-cooking.

08:35.760 --> 08:39.280
Okay, so I have my clone done and then I'm just gonna go in here

08:39.280 --> 08:41.760
and run through the dinos at the time of my life,

08:41.760 --> 08:45.680
meet Jeff, meet Sam, the whole gang.

08:45.680 --> 08:47.760
It's got Laura Dern. I'm gonna meet all of them.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.160
Then I will get killed by a dinosaur.

08:50.160 --> 08:53.840
But I know my children will have a papa tomorrow because of the clone.

08:53.840 --> 08:54.880
And it's like the prestige.

08:54.880 --> 08:58.160
You never know whether you're gonna be the new clone Griffin

08:58.160 --> 09:02.320
or the one inside the dinos, you know, tummy.

09:02.320 --> 09:02.560
Yeah.

09:03.120 --> 09:04.560
You never know which one you're gonna be.

09:04.560 --> 09:09.280
I'm just saying, hey, let us write the next Jurassic World movie, please.

09:09.280 --> 09:12.240
Like, I think that that would be way more fun of like,

09:12.240 --> 09:14.480
we cross this dinosaur and a chair.

09:14.480 --> 09:18.000
Like, okay, all right, I can sit on that T-Rex.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.920
Okay, like, that's interesting to me. Make them smaller.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.440
I've talked about this before.

09:23.440 --> 09:26.320
This is a pet project of mine of people being like,

09:26.320 --> 09:27.920
they want bigger, scarier dinosaurs.

09:27.920 --> 09:29.200
Like, no, no, no.

09:29.200 --> 09:32.160
I want a small T-Rex, like in Pee Wee's Playhouse.

09:32.160 --> 09:34.480
What they need to do is cross them with some animals

09:34.480 --> 09:36.000
that are a lot more spin kickable.

09:36.000 --> 09:36.480
Yeah.

09:36.480 --> 09:38.720
So cross them with the flamingo.

09:38.720 --> 09:42.160
Huge, stupid neck, long, dumb legs, pink.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.520
Like, you could just spin kick.

09:43.520 --> 09:45.360
So pink.

09:45.360 --> 09:47.760
So many kickable zones on a mingo, man.

09:47.760 --> 09:50.800
Or just give me like a T-Rex cross with a penguin

09:50.800 --> 09:52.400
where it kind of waddles a little bit

09:52.400 --> 09:55.280
and is literally like football sized.

09:55.280 --> 09:56.160
Can we?

09:56.160 --> 09:59.200
I love animals and I would fight to protect them.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.720
And I do every day.

10:00.720 --> 10:02.480
But if you had to spin kick a flamingo,

10:02.480 --> 10:05.040
what would be the most viscerally satisfying zone?

10:06.400 --> 10:08.560
I actually would love to get it right in the middle

10:08.560 --> 10:12.160
so that as I kicked it, it kind of veed to the side.

10:12.160 --> 10:13.520
It would wrap around your foot.

10:13.520 --> 10:14.720
It would wrap all the way around your foot.

10:14.720 --> 10:16.640
So that like the feet and the head

10:16.640 --> 10:18.720
would kind of trail behind it.

10:18.720 --> 10:21.040
Like you were throwing like a Nerf football

10:21.040 --> 10:22.480
that had a tail on it.

10:22.480 --> 10:24.240
Like, that's what I want.

10:24.240 --> 10:27.920
I would like to kick it in its head,

10:27.920 --> 10:30.480
but then it moves its head the last second

10:30.480 --> 10:32.720
and I miss and I fall to the ground.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.480
Then I punch it in its nuts.

10:36.640 --> 10:39.280
So wait, you want to try to kick it, miss it.

10:39.280 --> 10:41.120
Maybe it laughs a little bit at you.

10:41.120 --> 10:43.360
It's like, yeah, because I want that like,

10:43.360 --> 10:44.560
I want to feel better about it.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.960
You know, he's like a real jerk.

10:46.960 --> 10:48.720
You want a redemption story.

10:48.720 --> 10:49.760
Yes, exactly.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.400
You know how the boy who can fly

10:52.400 --> 10:54.160
when Fred Savage shoots that squirt gun

10:54.160 --> 10:56.880
full of piss at the bully and the bully says-

10:56.880 --> 10:57.200
Sorry?

11:00.480 --> 11:01.840
Just this one scene.

11:01.840 --> 11:04.400
I need that redemption, bully redemption moment.

11:04.400 --> 11:07.680
I need that Falkor soaring over the flamingo

11:08.560 --> 11:10.800
and peeing on everything as I punch him in the nuts.

11:10.800 --> 11:11.680
Was it his piss?

11:11.680 --> 11:15.520
It was Fred Savage's piss, bro.

11:15.520 --> 11:19.920
I can't, Griffin, both options are the worst.

11:20.960 --> 11:21.520
Well, you're right.

11:21.520 --> 11:22.560
If it was the bully's piss,

11:22.560 --> 11:23.840
it would be probably better for the bully,

11:23.840 --> 11:24.720
but how'd he get it?

11:27.280 --> 11:28.560
It's dinosaur piss.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.240
That's how it all comes back around.

11:31.200 --> 11:34.160
It could go like full psychological terror.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.480
Like this is the piss that I wrung out of your sheets

11:36.480 --> 11:38.240
when you went to bed last night

11:38.240 --> 11:40.640
because I screamed in the middle of the night

11:40.640 --> 11:43.840
and I know you pee yourself anyway.

11:43.840 --> 11:46.800
Hey, we've had like, I don't know,

11:46.800 --> 11:47.760
seven or eight Jurassic Park movies-

11:47.760 --> 11:50.160
Let Fred Savage play Batman!

11:50.160 --> 11:52.160
Let Fred Savage play Batman.

11:52.160 --> 11:55.920
How have we gone seven Jurassic Park movies or whatever

11:55.920 --> 11:57.280
and there's never once been a scene

11:57.280 --> 11:59.440
of a dinosaur peeing on somebody?

11:59.440 --> 12:01.600
Like, come on, it's right there.

12:02.240 --> 12:05.360
Y'all, I'm not gonna be able to think about anything

12:06.160 --> 12:08.160
but Fred Savage's piss gun.

12:08.160 --> 12:11.680
And I was Googling it just to make sure Justin wasn't lying

12:11.680 --> 12:13.280
or having a fever dream,

12:13.280 --> 12:16.320
and I couldn't really find like hard, firm news

12:16.320 --> 12:18.000
about Fred Savage's piss gun,

12:18.000 --> 12:21.440
but I did find a quote on IMDB that says,

12:21.440 --> 12:22.320
bad boy.

12:22.320 --> 12:24.240
So you thought you could make it around the block?

12:24.240 --> 12:25.920
Louis pulls out a water pistol.

12:25.920 --> 12:26.560
Bad boy.

12:26.560 --> 12:29.360
Oh, so now I'm supposed to be afraid of a water pistol?

12:29.360 --> 12:32.000
Louis, there ain't no water in this gun.

12:32.000 --> 12:32.720
Bad boy.

12:32.720 --> 12:33.840
So what's in it?

12:33.840 --> 12:34.320
Louis.

12:35.040 --> 12:35.540
Piss.

12:35.540 --> 12:36.040
Piss.

12:37.780 --> 12:40.180
Now, there's also a scene in Little Monsters,

12:40.180 --> 12:41.140
though I'm not mistaken,

12:41.140 --> 12:44.580
where Harry Mandel and Fred Savage pee in a bully's coke.

12:45.380 --> 12:45.780
Okay.

12:45.780 --> 12:48.180
So everybody, if you could find this Fred Savage.

12:49.940 --> 12:51.460
Pretty much any time.

12:51.460 --> 12:53.780
Okay, here's your challenge.

12:53.780 --> 12:56.900
Can everyone just find all the scenes of urine assault

12:56.900 --> 13:00.340
that Fred Savage has perpetrated in cinema history

13:00.340 --> 13:02.020
and just tweet them out to us?

13:02.900 --> 13:04.500
No, I'm not making calls like this again

13:04.500 --> 13:06.660
because the birthday one got really annoying really quickly

13:06.660 --> 13:07.940
and I regretted doing it.

13:07.940 --> 13:09.460
So I'm not doing this again, but like-

13:10.020 --> 13:11.460
Maybe a super cut?

13:11.460 --> 13:15.060
Maybe a super cut of all the times that Fred Savage-

13:15.060 --> 13:16.500
Has weaponized urine.

13:17.140 --> 13:17.640
Yeah.

13:17.940 --> 13:20.820
If you just search Fred Savage piss on YouTube,

13:21.460 --> 13:23.220
it's the very first result.

13:23.220 --> 13:25.700
And then lean back and maybe close one eye

13:25.700 --> 13:27.220
and just be careful.

13:27.220 --> 13:30.100
There's probably a joke about the wizard,

13:30.100 --> 13:31.620
but not on this show.

13:31.620 --> 13:32.660
There won't be.

13:32.660 --> 13:33.940
No, not here.

13:33.940 --> 13:35.300
We don't work blue.

13:36.020 --> 13:36.740
Can we do the show?

13:36.740 --> 13:37.700
It's been so long.

13:38.420 --> 13:39.780
Well, can we just watch this scene?

13:40.580 --> 13:42.340
Because everybody in the audience is going to do it.

13:42.340 --> 13:44.180
So I want to give them a time period where-

13:44.180 --> 13:45.380
It's 25 seconds.

13:45.380 --> 13:46.900
So if we could just watch this one scene

13:46.900 --> 13:48.660
from The Boy Who Could Fly real quick,

13:48.660 --> 13:49.540
starting now.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.180
So you thought you could get around the block.

13:57.780 --> 13:59.860
Go ahead and make my day.

13:59.860 --> 14:03.300
Oh, I'm supposed to be real scared of a water pistol.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.540
There ain't no water on this gun.

14:05.540 --> 14:07.700
So, what's in it?

14:07.700 --> 14:10.260
Piss.

14:10.260 --> 14:15.220
Oh, shit!

14:15.220 --> 14:16.420
He gets him in the face.

14:18.420 --> 14:19.140
Classic.

14:19.140 --> 14:20.580
This is culturally important.

14:20.580 --> 14:22.660
He gets him in the open mouth.

14:22.660 --> 14:24.180
He really blasts off.

14:25.540 --> 14:26.980
It's fucking good.

14:26.980 --> 14:29.540
And you know what the best fucking thing

14:29.540 --> 14:30.660
in this entire clip-

14:30.660 --> 14:34.100
Hey, Griffin, please put the audio for this clip

14:34.100 --> 14:34.660
into the show.

14:34.660 --> 14:35.940
Griffin is with the audience.

14:35.940 --> 14:37.060
The best fucking thing though,

14:37.060 --> 14:38.180
you do have to go watch it

14:38.180 --> 14:39.940
because the last thing that happens-

14:39.940 --> 14:41.060
Fred Savage, I should mention,

14:41.060 --> 14:42.820
is like eight and on a big wheel.

14:42.820 --> 14:43.860
The last thing that happens,

14:43.860 --> 14:45.620
he sprays this bully with piss.

14:45.620 --> 14:51.380
The bully falls on his own baseball bat and trips.

14:51.380 --> 14:53.860
And then Fred Savage chucks his gun

14:53.860 --> 14:55.460
into a neighbor's yard.

14:56.660 --> 14:57.700
Ditching the evidence.

14:57.700 --> 14:58.740
Like he's just done a-

14:58.740 --> 14:59.940
Like the police are gonna-

14:59.940 --> 15:00.180
Yeah.

15:00.180 --> 15:00.900
Execution.

15:01.780 --> 15:03.300
It's amazing.

15:03.300 --> 15:04.260
It's wild.

15:04.260 --> 15:05.380
Holy crap.

15:05.380 --> 15:06.820
The boy who could fly.

15:06.820 --> 15:07.620
And that's not-

15:07.620 --> 15:08.740
Here's the thing.

15:08.740 --> 15:11.140
That's not what this movie is about.

15:11.140 --> 15:12.020
No, for me.

15:13.940 --> 15:16.580
You would think it would be just about

15:18.420 --> 15:20.580
building up to this exact moment

15:21.460 --> 15:25.460
when Fred Savage blasted this bully with pee.

15:25.460 --> 15:29.460
Pee, so this is an invite show

15:30.660 --> 15:33.940
and we're gonna get right down to it.

15:33.940 --> 15:36.580
My office has an annual Thanksgiving potluck.

15:36.580 --> 15:39.140
People take this very seriously.

15:39.140 --> 15:42.180
Years ago, someone brought a half store bought pie

15:42.180 --> 15:44.660
that person was soon after fired.

15:45.220 --> 15:46.900
I'm sure there were other contributing factors.

15:46.900 --> 15:47.700
There didn't need to be.

15:47.700 --> 15:48.420
That's a joke.

15:49.300 --> 15:51.460
Yeah, people still bring him

15:51.460 --> 15:55.300
and his half a pie up in regular conversation.

15:55.300 --> 15:56.660
But here's the other important fact.

15:57.220 --> 15:59.540
I don't really want to put a lot of work into this.

15:59.540 --> 16:01.540
What should I bring that will be good enough

16:01.540 --> 16:05.380
to not get fired and also require minimum effort?

16:06.580 --> 16:09.220
You are playing with fire, Jason.

16:11.700 --> 16:13.380
Yeah, it's a tricky one, right?

16:13.380 --> 16:14.100
Thanksgiving is.

16:14.100 --> 16:15.300
Cause I know there's a lot of people

16:15.300 --> 16:17.060
who maybe don't like cooking.

16:17.060 --> 16:19.460
And so maybe you just do want to swing by the,

16:19.460 --> 16:22.820
you know, Kroger get some pecan cups or something.

16:22.820 --> 16:23.940
And I think that's fine.

16:23.940 --> 16:24.900
I think that's okay.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.260
But the whole thing is like,

16:26.260 --> 16:28.260
I worked on this for you to eat it.

16:28.260 --> 16:30.740
And that's, I don't know.

16:30.740 --> 16:33.780
That's what makes it such a nice gesture, you know?

16:33.780 --> 16:36.020
But here's the thing about it, Jason is like,

16:36.020 --> 16:38.900
I wish, listen, I know that the jobs

16:38.900 --> 16:40.740
that Justin Griffin and I have now

16:40.740 --> 16:42.020
are very non-conventional,

16:42.020 --> 16:42.980
but there were some times

16:42.980 --> 16:45.220
where I worked some fairly conventional jobs

16:45.220 --> 16:47.140
and I wish that there had been opportunities

16:47.140 --> 16:50.580
of like this one day, you know exactly what metric

16:50.580 --> 16:52.020
you're being judged by.

16:52.020 --> 16:55.060
And if you just deliver like a banger of a dessert,

16:55.060 --> 16:56.340
you might get a promotion.

16:57.300 --> 16:58.980
Like, cause it's gotta work both ways, right?

16:58.980 --> 17:00.340
Like that's a shitty, you brought,

17:00.900 --> 17:02.020
I'm sorry, person in the past,

17:02.020 --> 17:03.060
we got fired for this.

17:03.060 --> 17:05.220
You brought half a pie?

17:06.100 --> 17:08.340
So like the other half had already been eaten.

17:09.220 --> 17:10.980
You deserve to be fired.

17:10.980 --> 17:13.060
But you bring like a banger dessert

17:13.060 --> 17:15.620
and it's like, you get the Johnson account.

17:15.620 --> 17:17.300
It ain't gonna be a dessert.

17:17.300 --> 17:19.220
It's gotta be the whole Turk, doesn't it?

17:19.220 --> 17:21.700
It's gotta be the showstopper Turk of the century

17:21.700 --> 17:24.180
if you wanna get the boss's job, I think.

17:24.180 --> 17:26.260
Here's what I would recommend.

17:26.260 --> 17:27.620
I have made a lot of different dishes

17:27.620 --> 17:28.740
for a lot of different purposes

17:28.740 --> 17:30.980
and I'm not gonna get into the ins and outs of baking.

17:30.980 --> 17:34.820
Here's my fucking slam dunk, easy,

17:34.820 --> 17:37.700
everyone will love you recipe.

17:37.700 --> 17:38.420
Here's what you do.

17:38.980 --> 17:41.220
You go pop a couple of bags of popcorn,

17:41.220 --> 17:44.340
you buy like chocolate bark,

17:44.340 --> 17:45.540
it's over in the baking section,

17:45.540 --> 17:47.780
like chocolate bark that you melt in the microwave,

17:47.780 --> 17:49.300
literally melt in the microwave

17:49.300 --> 17:51.700
and then you buy a bunch of candy canes

17:51.700 --> 17:53.540
that you crush up into dust.

17:53.540 --> 17:56.100
You pop the popcorn, you put it on a sheet,

17:56.100 --> 17:57.460
cover it in the chocolate,

17:57.460 --> 17:59.060
turn in the chocolate, stir the chocolate,

17:59.060 --> 18:02.820
then stir the crushed up candy cane into it,

18:02.820 --> 18:04.980
lay it out on a sheet, let it cool and harden.

18:04.980 --> 18:07.700
People will be crazy for it.

18:07.700 --> 18:10.100
It's the easiest shit in the world to make

18:10.100 --> 18:12.100
and people will lose it.

18:12.100 --> 18:13.380
They will lose it.

18:13.380 --> 18:15.540
And you'll be a grand slam person

18:15.540 --> 18:19.700
that didn't put hardly any work into this at all.

18:20.340 --> 18:21.620
Turkey's easy too, though.

18:21.620 --> 18:24.180
Turkey's so easy, you just gotta wait.

18:24.180 --> 18:26.740
You know, salt it, pepper it and get it hot.

18:26.740 --> 18:28.260
I don't see why people always complain

18:28.260 --> 18:29.700
and have a special hotline.

18:29.700 --> 18:31.140
You just put it in the oven,

18:31.140 --> 18:33.780
which makes things hotter once they're in there.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.260
Get the bird hot enough, the flesh turns good.

18:36.260 --> 18:38.260
I don't see why everybody freaks out about this shit.

18:38.260 --> 18:39.540
That's pretty clear, Griffin.

18:39.540 --> 18:40.660
Here's the problem, Jason,

18:40.660 --> 18:41.700
you've asked us this question

18:41.700 --> 18:43.300
but you didn't give us what kind of budget

18:43.300 --> 18:44.020
you're working with.

18:44.020 --> 18:45.700
Yeah, a lot of stuff.

18:45.700 --> 18:49.300
You could maybe get a Wolfgang Puck-esque figure

18:49.300 --> 18:51.060
to make individualized turkeys

18:51.060 --> 18:52.580
for each person you work with.

18:52.580 --> 18:53.860
You don't have to do it.

18:53.860 --> 18:55.300
Wolfgang's banking them

18:55.300 --> 18:56.980
and every turkey reminds them

18:56.980 --> 18:59.300
of their favorite childhood memory or whatever.

18:59.300 --> 19:01.140
And then now you own the company.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.140
He definitely has a rat in his hat

19:03.140 --> 19:05.060
telling him how to do shit, though, huh?

19:05.060 --> 19:06.660
Wolfgang Puck, definitely.

19:06.660 --> 19:08.420
He's probably got, oh, wouldn't it be funny

19:08.420 --> 19:10.260
if he actually had nine wolves

19:10.260 --> 19:11.940
telling him how to cook in the kitchen

19:11.940 --> 19:13.620
and that's how he got his name?

19:13.620 --> 19:15.460
And maybe one Shakespearean fairy.

19:17.460 --> 19:18.820
You could tell your boss

19:18.820 --> 19:21.060
that you will bite the bullet,

19:21.060 --> 19:22.660
you'll make the turkey for everybody.

19:22.660 --> 19:25.620
You'll be in charge of turkey to bring in

19:25.620 --> 19:27.460
but listen, you're gonna have to stay home

19:27.460 --> 19:29.060
and babysit this bird.

19:29.060 --> 19:30.660
You gotta babysit the bird

19:30.660 --> 19:33.300
because you never know when it's gonna be done.

19:33.300 --> 19:33.780
Yeah.

19:33.780 --> 19:35.540
So you gotta stay home from work.

19:35.540 --> 19:36.500
Come in at lunch

19:36.500 --> 19:38.180
because you got a turkey baking at home.

19:38.180 --> 19:40.020
So this is like you get the day off

19:40.020 --> 19:42.180
but you do have to bring in a turkey

19:42.180 --> 19:43.220
and there is that stress

19:43.220 --> 19:44.500
of being sort of the centerpiece.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.140
And then you be the centerpiece

19:47.140 --> 19:48.980
and let them eat the turkey off of your body.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.420
That's what's good is you don't even have

19:50.420 --> 19:51.300
to cook the turkey.

19:51.300 --> 19:53.700
You come in with it on your head like in Friends.

19:54.500 --> 19:55.780
I wanna tell everybody a fun,

19:56.900 --> 19:58.660
a quick sidebar, cooking sidebar.

19:58.660 --> 20:01.060
I feel like this is gonna be this sort of episode

20:01.060 --> 20:03.300
with a lot of sidebars and fun blind alleys.

20:04.900 --> 20:08.340
It was my in-laws 40th anniversary this weekend

20:08.340 --> 20:09.540
and they went up to Lexington

20:09.540 --> 20:10.660
at the, I believe you've been there,

20:10.660 --> 20:12.740
or sorry, Louisville at the,

20:12.740 --> 20:14.660
I believe you've been to the Brown Hotel, Travis?

20:14.660 --> 20:15.380
I have, yes.

20:15.380 --> 20:15.860
Okay.

20:15.860 --> 20:16.660
That's the name of it.

20:17.380 --> 20:18.580
It's not like I can't remember the name

20:19.140 --> 20:20.260
and I'm just telling you the color.

20:20.260 --> 20:21.460
It's the Brown Hotel.

20:21.460 --> 20:25.300
And they decided to stay in the last night they were there,

20:25.300 --> 20:26.580
just enjoy each other's company

20:26.580 --> 20:30.180
and get a nice pizza delivered by Grubhub.

20:31.300 --> 20:34.580
So they ordered this pizza from Grubhub

20:35.540 --> 20:36.900
and when it shows up,

20:36.900 --> 20:39.540
they finally, they understand,

20:39.540 --> 20:41.700
they come to realize instantaneously

20:41.700 --> 20:43.140
that they have ordered,

20:43.140 --> 20:44.420
that my father-in-law, Tommy,

20:44.420 --> 20:49.700
has ordered a pizza from a take and bake pizza place.

20:49.700 --> 20:50.980
Oh, goodness.

20:50.980 --> 20:54.020
So you tell them what ingredients you want

20:54.020 --> 20:55.700
and then you come there and pick it up

20:55.700 --> 20:56.980
and then you bake it at your house,

20:57.700 --> 20:59.220
which I guess is a restaurant concept

20:59.220 --> 21:00.660
that I was not aware of,

21:00.660 --> 21:04.820
but at no point during this exchange of ideas

21:04.820 --> 21:08.420
did anyone say, like, this is not going to work.

21:08.420 --> 21:11.700
You're not going to be able to bake this pizza

21:11.700 --> 21:13.140
in your hotel room.

21:13.140 --> 21:15.060
It just isn't going to happen.

21:15.620 --> 21:16.980
And I asked my father-in-law,

21:16.980 --> 21:18.420
because I know him very well,

21:18.420 --> 21:20.180
well, you didn't throw it away, did you?

21:20.180 --> 21:21.460
And he said, no, I didn't.

21:22.260 --> 21:24.180
We had brought a beer cooler with us

21:24.180 --> 21:31.700
and I put it down sort of sideways into the corner

21:31.700 --> 21:36.580
and kind of put ice down at the bottom of it

21:36.580 --> 21:39.300
and kind of left it standing up inside the cooler

21:39.300 --> 21:40.660
buried in this ice.

21:40.660 --> 21:42.820
But then I went to check on it the next morning

21:42.820 --> 21:44.260
and it had just collapsed.

21:47.540 --> 21:50.260
But good news, I invented pizza water,

21:50.260 --> 21:51.140
which is great.

21:52.580 --> 21:54.660
So I threw it into the trash.

21:54.660 --> 21:58.020
Can you imagine being the maid cleaning this room?

21:58.020 --> 21:59.780
What the fuck were you all doing?

21:59.780 --> 22:02.260
What kind of wild party happened in here?

22:02.260 --> 22:03.940
What was your strat?

22:03.940 --> 22:05.380
Did you make the pizza

22:05.380 --> 22:07.220
and then decided the last minute?

22:07.220 --> 22:07.700
No.

22:07.700 --> 22:09.460
It's wrapped in plastic.

22:10.900 --> 22:11.780
Oh, man, that's good.

22:11.780 --> 22:13.060
Hey, how about a Yahoo?

22:13.060 --> 22:13.380
Yes.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.580
This one was sent in by lots of people.

22:16.580 --> 22:17.380
Thank you, everybody.

22:17.380 --> 22:19.300
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user.

22:20.100 --> 22:22.020
They're anonymous, so I'll call them.

22:22.660 --> 22:26.820
Boris asks, can you be naked in a laundromat?

22:26.820 --> 22:29.300
Can you wash the clothes you have on

22:29.300 --> 22:31.860
and be naked in a laundromat while they're washing?

22:32.900 --> 22:34.740
Have you guys ever cooked laundry,

22:34.740 --> 22:36.740
cooked laundry in a laundromat?

22:36.740 --> 22:38.020
I've cooked some laundry,

22:38.980 --> 22:42.260
both in college and post-college.

22:43.620 --> 22:47.060
Living in LA, I've used several laundromats.

22:47.060 --> 22:52.500
I understand why you can't just be fully nude

22:52.500 --> 22:54.020
in public most of the time.

22:54.020 --> 22:54.900
I mean, I can't,

22:54.900 --> 22:58.260
but I understand why folks get up in arms about it.

22:59.860 --> 23:01.700
But in a laundromat, it does feel...

23:03.140 --> 23:05.300
It doesn't feel fair, does it?

23:05.300 --> 23:07.300
It's like if you did go to a pizza hut,

23:07.300 --> 23:08.740
but they stopped you from eating

23:08.740 --> 23:10.900
the last slice of pizza every time.

23:10.900 --> 23:11.540
Do you know what I mean?

23:11.540 --> 23:13.620
I need to cook all my laundry,

23:13.620 --> 23:15.940
except for this one last little bit.

23:15.940 --> 23:17.860
You will never know the experience

23:17.860 --> 23:20.180
of having all your clothes clean at the same time.

23:20.180 --> 23:22.020
It does kind of feel like when you get to the laundromat,

23:22.020 --> 23:23.940
they should like hand you a robe

23:23.940 --> 23:26.340
and invite you into a changing room.

23:26.980 --> 23:29.380
They should provide that for you.

23:29.380 --> 23:33.780
I get you don't want me nude with my business out,

23:33.780 --> 23:35.220
so give me an alternative.

23:35.220 --> 23:35.860
You know what I mean?

23:35.860 --> 23:39.140
Give me an airlock that I can walk through,

23:39.140 --> 23:40.180
change into the robe,

23:40.180 --> 23:41.300
and then walk through the rest

23:41.300 --> 23:44.100
that I'm in the laundromat in my robe.

23:44.100 --> 23:47.060
Or just somebody's old cruddy dungarees

23:47.060 --> 23:48.500
that they left behind.

23:48.500 --> 23:49.780
Or like a cycle?

23:49.780 --> 23:51.060
We cycle through the clothes.

23:51.780 --> 23:52.740
Well, kinda.

23:52.740 --> 23:55.140
I was thinking of one communal pair of dungarees,

23:55.140 --> 23:58.020
and we don't have to cover the top, just the bottom,

23:58.020 --> 24:00.180
because that's where the worst stuff lives.

24:00.180 --> 24:02.740
And so we can just have one crusty old pair of dungarees

24:02.740 --> 24:05.540
that you can use as needed.

24:05.540 --> 24:06.820
And they can be pretty big,

24:06.820 --> 24:08.020
and you just cinch them up.

24:09.060 --> 24:10.900
Could you have a place

24:10.900 --> 24:14.660
that is a combination laundromat spray tan place?

24:15.460 --> 24:19.460
So you go, you want to get that sun-kissed look

24:19.460 --> 24:22.660
here in early November.

24:22.660 --> 24:26.420
You go in, you throw your clothes in the wash,

24:26.420 --> 24:28.660
and then they give you that great look.

24:28.660 --> 24:30.740
But here's the one thing about it,

24:30.740 --> 24:33.700
is that it needs to do a place that does it all,

24:33.700 --> 24:36.900
or else it's not gonna be complete.

24:36.900 --> 24:38.900
The process will not be complete.

24:38.900 --> 24:41.060
So it needs to advertise itself as like,

24:41.620 --> 24:43.860
yes, we do the butt, too.

24:43.860 --> 24:44.740
Oh, okay.

24:44.740 --> 24:45.940
Your butt will be tan.

24:46.820 --> 24:47.540
I guess if they could get a pink diaper.

24:47.540 --> 24:51.860
Justin, there is no way on earth

24:51.860 --> 24:53.620
that that doesn't already exist.

24:54.660 --> 24:55.140
You think?

24:55.780 --> 24:59.060
Yeah, like a spray tan slash laundromat.

25:00.340 --> 25:03.620
It just seems to me like not that wild of an idea.

25:04.260 --> 25:05.940
It has to exist somewhere.

25:06.820 --> 25:08.180
Now let me hit you with this.

25:09.380 --> 25:10.980
A spray tan laundromat

25:11.540 --> 25:13.940
where you put your body in the washing machine

25:13.940 --> 25:15.780
and they spray tan all your clothes.

25:16.340 --> 25:17.060
Okay.

25:17.060 --> 25:19.220
Just to give them a little sun-kissed color

25:19.220 --> 25:22.020
as we move into the long, long winter months.

25:22.900 --> 25:26.980
Or what if it's like a combination laundromat spray tan

25:26.980 --> 25:28.820
where you walk in in your clothes,

25:28.820 --> 25:30.900
they spray tan you, you're still wearing your clothes,

25:30.900 --> 25:32.260
and then you take a step forward

25:32.260 --> 25:33.460
and then they wash your clothes

25:33.460 --> 25:35.460
while you're wearing them like a car wash.

25:35.460 --> 25:35.860
Okay.

25:36.500 --> 25:38.100
So you're getting the spray tan

25:38.100 --> 25:40.100
and then they wash the spray tan off your clothes.

25:41.140 --> 25:44.660
How about a combination laundromat spray tan Taco Bell?

25:44.660 --> 25:45.380
Okay.

25:45.380 --> 25:48.260
Okay, so then you eat the Taco Bell,

25:48.260 --> 25:51.140
you shit your pants, you throw it right into the wash.

25:52.020 --> 25:53.620
And I mean, you drop all their messy,

25:53.620 --> 25:55.060
nasty lettuce all over yourself

25:55.060 --> 25:57.620
and it's got sauces you wouldn't even believe of

25:57.620 --> 25:59.060
that paint the front of your shirt,

26:00.100 --> 26:03.060
just a beautiful spectrum of hot colors.

26:03.060 --> 26:04.500
And then you're gonna have to wash those off

26:04.500 --> 26:06.340
while you get a sweet sun-kissed look.

26:06.340 --> 26:10.340
And I think you can just knock out all your needs in one go.

26:10.340 --> 26:14.340
What about a combination spray tan and laser tag place

26:14.340 --> 26:16.820
where the laser tag guns shoot spray tan?

26:17.380 --> 26:18.980
That's really good, Travis.

26:18.980 --> 26:20.660
Wow, Travis, that's excellent.

26:21.620 --> 26:22.740
Oh, also, you're nude.

26:22.740 --> 26:24.740
It's important to note you are nude.

26:24.740 --> 26:27.940
Bunch of nude adults running around with spray tan guns

26:27.940 --> 26:30.020
and then when the match is over,

26:30.660 --> 26:34.420
there's a judge who meticulously figures out

26:34.420 --> 26:36.820
what percentage of your body has been spray tanned.

26:36.820 --> 26:38.900
And that includes hair and eyeballs.

26:39.460 --> 26:40.820
And they're gonna figure it out.

26:40.820 --> 26:43.220
Always, they're very accurate with their measurements.

26:43.220 --> 26:44.900
And it's called spray-zer tag.

26:44.900 --> 26:46.900
Spray-zer tag is the best.

26:46.900 --> 26:48.340
And then we're gonna get a Taco Bell

26:48.340 --> 26:49.860
and a laundromat in there somewhere.

26:49.860 --> 26:52.900
Well, yeah, you gotta get some celebratory tacos afterwards

26:52.900 --> 26:54.660
and you're gonna have something to do with your clothes

26:54.660 --> 26:56.340
while you're playing spray-zer tag.

26:56.340 --> 26:57.140
So that's what you do.

26:57.140 --> 26:59.060
You get there, you pop your clothes in the laundromat,

26:59.060 --> 27:01.700
you all look around, you have a moment of discomfort

27:01.700 --> 27:02.900
because you're all nude,

27:02.900 --> 27:05.140
but then someone comes and hands you a squirt gun

27:05.140 --> 27:07.140
and they say, oh, I'm seriously afraid of a squirt gun

27:07.140 --> 27:08.500
and say, well, there's not water in there.

27:08.500 --> 27:09.380
And they say, what is it?

27:09.380 --> 27:11.300
And they say, it's spray tan.

27:11.300 --> 27:12.740
And so then-

27:12.740 --> 27:14.740
You say, goof-oo, I thought it was gonna be piss.

27:14.740 --> 27:16.740
I was so worried you were gonna say piss.

27:16.740 --> 27:18.340
And they say, not this time.

27:18.340 --> 27:19.620
And then you kind of give them a weird look

27:19.620 --> 27:20.900
and they chuckle and they say, I'm just kidding.

27:20.900 --> 27:21.860
It's never piss.

27:21.860 --> 27:24.900
And then you run through like different obstacles

27:25.460 --> 27:26.980
and some of you are on one team

27:26.980 --> 27:28.180
and some of you are on the other.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.220
You shoot at each other

27:29.220 --> 27:31.300
and then you get scrutinized at the end by a judge

27:31.300 --> 27:33.860
who determines how much spray tan stuff ended up on you.

27:33.860 --> 27:35.060
And then they say, you did great.

27:35.060 --> 27:37.300
And you either get celebratory tacos

27:37.300 --> 27:40.740
or like a taco consoling.

27:40.740 --> 27:42.340
Yeah, consolation tacos.

27:42.340 --> 27:44.180
And then, oh, also your clothes are clean.

27:45.540 --> 27:46.420
Have a great day.

27:46.420 --> 27:48.180
And then they put a punch under your punch card.

27:48.180 --> 27:50.020
And if you get 10 of those, you get a free time.

27:51.060 --> 27:53.540
Hey, speaking of the piss soldier, Fred Savage,

27:54.180 --> 27:56.100
I still have his IMDB page open

27:56.100 --> 27:59.060
and his bio on here is a trip, man.

27:59.700 --> 28:00.900
It is wild.

28:00.900 --> 28:02.260
It says the following.

28:02.260 --> 28:04.660
At the age of 12, he was cast the lead role

28:04.660 --> 28:07.940
of the series, The Wonder Years, 1988.

28:07.940 --> 28:09.700
It became a good show

28:09.700 --> 28:11.940
and on the pilot, he got his first kiss.

28:13.060 --> 28:14.660
It became a good show.

28:20.820 --> 28:22.100
This is the beginning.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.140
Oh, okay.

28:23.140 --> 28:24.980
I thought you just fell off your desk chair.

28:26.260 --> 28:28.100
This is what The Wonder Years would sound like

28:28.100 --> 28:30.180
if the singer was pushed down a well.

28:30.180 --> 28:31.940
Anytime Joe Cocker is singing,

28:31.940 --> 28:34.420
he is always about to fall out of his desk chair.

28:34.420 --> 28:35.700
That's the secret too.

28:35.700 --> 28:36.900
He's sitting on a yoga ball.

28:36.900 --> 28:40.580
She can't get through the bathroom window.

28:41.300 --> 28:42.900
Joe, be careful, my friend.

28:44.420 --> 28:46.180
Can we go to the money zone?

28:46.180 --> 28:47.300
We're already there.

28:47.300 --> 28:50.020
This is an ad for Joe Cocker's bargain desk chair.

28:50.020 --> 28:51.220
Sprazor tag.

28:51.220 --> 28:54.820
Lightly used complete sprazor tag with Joe Cocker.

28:54.820 --> 29:09.300
This lightly used desk chair.

29:09.300 --> 29:11.380
This is an ad right here.

29:11.380 --> 29:13.940
This is an ad for Ring.

29:13.940 --> 29:16.580
I love Ring.

29:16.580 --> 29:21.540
Ring is a little robot that is attached to your front door

29:21.540 --> 29:24.820
and it looks like a doorbell and it is.

29:24.820 --> 29:26.100
If someone walks up to your door,

29:26.100 --> 29:27.380
they can press this thing

29:27.380 --> 29:29.300
and you'll get a notification on your phone

29:29.300 --> 29:31.540
so you can answer it from anywhere in the world.

29:32.500 --> 29:33.940
They have service, of course,

29:33.940 --> 29:37.300
and you can see what they want.

29:38.500 --> 29:40.500
Hey, what's going on?

29:40.500 --> 29:42.820
It's usually the FedEx person,

29:42.820 --> 29:46.500
but sometimes it could be anybody.

29:46.500 --> 29:47.620
I don't know who's at your door.

29:47.620 --> 29:48.740
This is why you need Ring.

29:49.380 --> 29:50.180
Let me tell you.

29:50.180 --> 29:51.060
Purpose.

29:51.060 --> 29:52.580
Here's the amazing thing about it, right?

29:52.580 --> 29:54.500
Yeah, it gets the people who ring the bell,

29:54.500 --> 29:55.620
but it also just,

29:55.620 --> 29:57.540
if you are worried about packages

29:57.540 --> 29:58.980
being taken off of your porch,

29:59.540 --> 30:00.820
you get motion alerts

30:00.820 --> 30:02.740
even if they don't ring the doorbell

30:02.740 --> 30:05.380
or I actually just found out recently

30:05.380 --> 30:10.100
that there's a neighborhood tab in the Ring app

30:10.100 --> 30:13.460
where you can post or other people will post videos

30:13.460 --> 30:15.140
of people doing shady stuff

30:15.140 --> 30:17.220
and be like, hey, keep an eye out for this person.

30:17.220 --> 30:19.060
Imagine a social network

30:19.060 --> 30:23.300
that is strictly comprised of people in your neighborhood

30:23.300 --> 30:25.940
capturing people being sneaky criminals.

30:25.940 --> 30:29.060
It is worth the price of admission, I think,

30:29.060 --> 30:30.500
and I think, you know what?

30:30.500 --> 30:31.940
Surprisingly affordable price.

30:31.940 --> 30:32.900
I think you should check it out.

30:34.420 --> 30:36.980
We have a special offer on the Ring Starter Kit

30:36.980 --> 30:38.020

30:56.900 --> 30:59.780
I would like to tell you something amazing.

31:00.660 --> 31:02.180
I am very, very excited

31:02.180 --> 31:05.220
because I have just received today

31:05.220 --> 31:06.900
moments before sitting down to record

31:07.460 --> 31:10.260
my first pair of me undies lounge pants.

31:10.260 --> 31:11.540
That's what the doorbell was.

31:11.540 --> 31:13.460
Are you telling me there's fucking lounge pants

31:13.460 --> 31:14.500
in this bag I got?

31:15.140 --> 31:15.640
Yes.

31:15.640 --> 31:17.800
Yes, and here's the thing.

31:17.800 --> 31:21.000
They look like flannel pajama pants,

31:21.720 --> 31:24.600
but they're made out of me undies material.

31:24.600 --> 31:26.680
That micromodal fabric,

31:26.680 --> 31:29.240
which is three times softer than cotton.

31:29.240 --> 31:30.600
And if you've never felt this fabric,

31:30.600 --> 31:33.800
get ready to experience pure bliss in underwear form.

31:33.800 --> 31:36.840
Like I am a little worried, honestly,

31:36.840 --> 31:39.720
that if I wear this micromodal pants

31:39.720 --> 31:41.480
with my micromodal me undies,

31:41.480 --> 31:43.880
I will be so comfortable

31:43.880 --> 31:46.120
that I will Alex Mack into a puddle.

31:47.160 --> 31:48.840
I'm very excited about it.

31:50.040 --> 31:52.360
But yeah, this holiday plaid I think is real cute.

31:52.360 --> 31:55.960
And also for the Halloween holidays,

31:55.960 --> 31:59.160
I had some like cool like jack-o'-lantern underpants.

31:59.160 --> 32:00.840
I just got so many great underpants

32:00.840 --> 32:04.200
and now shirts and like sweatshirt me undies

32:04.200 --> 32:06.360

32:38.920 --> 32:40.280
I got Jumbotrons.

32:40.280 --> 32:44.680
Jumbotrons for sale, $1 each for Justin and Travis.

32:44.680 --> 32:45.560
What do you say?

32:45.560 --> 32:46.120
Pony up.

32:46.760 --> 32:49.480
I'll take it, but I'll have to owe you the dollar.

32:49.480 --> 32:52.200
All right, so this one's for Sarah and it's from Sarah.

32:52.200 --> 32:53.560
That's where they have the same name.

32:53.560 --> 32:55.080
Just kidding, they're the same person.

32:55.080 --> 32:55.640
Here it goes.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.320
Sarah says to Sarah, surprise.

32:58.520 --> 32:59.020
Is it?

33:00.120 --> 33:00.520
Is it?

33:01.080 --> 33:04.360
Well, Sarah bought this while like hopped up on Ambien.

33:04.360 --> 33:05.000
All right, maybe.

33:05.880 --> 33:06.760
Surprise!

33:06.760 --> 33:08.680
It's random self-appreciation day.

33:08.680 --> 33:12.200
Push the clock ahead an hour to put the kids in bed early tonight.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.760
Pour yourself a glass of wine and dig out the Oreos

33:14.760 --> 33:17.080
that you've been hiding in the Grape-Nuts box.

33:17.080 --> 33:18.120
That's a clever ruse.

33:18.120 --> 33:20.040
Ain't nobody gonna fucking look in there.

33:20.840 --> 33:22.840
You work incredibly hard and you deserve this.

33:22.840 --> 33:23.400
Great job.

33:23.400 --> 33:23.880
P.S.

33:23.880 --> 33:26.040
You just blew up your secret cookie spot.

33:26.040 --> 33:27.720
Remember to find a new one.

33:27.720 --> 33:29.720
Not gonna be as ironclad as Grape-Nuts.

33:29.720 --> 33:30.760
Those things are awful.

33:32.360 --> 33:36.920
Sarah, I love this full-blown grift you have planned on your kids

33:36.920 --> 33:40.120
of like moving every clock in the house forward an hour

33:40.680 --> 33:42.360
so that you can be like, oh, it's bedtime.

33:42.360 --> 33:45.000
And the kids are like, the sun's out and I do not feel tired at all.

33:45.000 --> 33:45.960
And you're like, well, it's eight.

33:45.960 --> 33:47.080
And they're like, I guess you're right.

33:47.080 --> 33:48.120
And they go to bed.

33:48.120 --> 33:50.120
Can't argue with the clock.

33:50.600 --> 33:55.320
Here's one that is sent in by Benji and it's from Shreds who says,

33:55.320 --> 33:59.000
Ben, and then I have to wait because I scrolled up accidentally.

33:59.560 --> 34:03.640
Ben, you are the kindest, most selfless person I've ever known

34:03.640 --> 34:05.640
and I'm proud to be your best friend.

34:05.640 --> 34:08.760
Thank you for baking such good pretzels and donuts

34:08.760 --> 34:11.080
and always being there to watch Jeopardy with me

34:11.080 --> 34:13.320
and being the best travel buddy imaginable.

34:13.320 --> 34:17.000
You're the coolest astrophysicist and the best boyfriend ever.

34:17.000 --> 34:17.480
Love you.

34:18.440 --> 34:19.880
Did you boys know?

34:20.920 --> 34:23.960
They have Jeopardy on Netflix and that's not a joke.

34:23.960 --> 34:24.520
What?

34:24.520 --> 34:25.320
Why? Why?

34:26.040 --> 34:27.560
Yeah, yeah.

34:27.560 --> 34:29.240
Hey, Griffin, why, bud?

34:29.240 --> 34:31.560
Yeah, like, yeah.

34:31.560 --> 34:36.680
Unless it's like only like the wildest, too hot for TV Jerry Springer episodes

34:36.680 --> 34:39.400
of Jeopardy that they can't show in syndication

34:39.400 --> 34:44.360
where like, you know, a dude wearing shorts gets excited and a nut comes out.

34:44.360 --> 34:47.160
That one's got to live on dark Netflix.

34:47.160 --> 34:51.880
Since the dawn of time, screenwriters have taken months to craft their stories.

34:51.880 --> 34:56.440
But now three Hollywood professionals shall attempt the impossible.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.480
Break a story in one hour.

34:59.480 --> 35:03.560
That's right. Here on Story Break, I, Freddie Wong, Matt Arnold, and Will Campos,

35:03.560 --> 35:06.440
the creators behind award-winning shows like Video Game High School,

35:06.440 --> 35:09.320
have one hour to turn a humble idea into an awesome movie.

35:09.320 --> 35:11.880
Now, an awesome movie starts with an awesome title.

35:11.880 --> 35:14.280
I chose The Billionaire's Marriage Valley.

35:14.280 --> 35:17.000
Mine was Christmas Pregnant Paradise.

35:17.720 --> 35:19.320
Okay, next we need a protagonist.

35:19.320 --> 35:22.440
So I've heard Wario best described as libertarian, Mark.

35:23.480 --> 35:26.440
And of course, every great movie needs a stellar pitch.

35:26.440 --> 35:29.640
In order to get to heaven, sometimes you got to raise a little hell.

35:29.640 --> 35:30.840
That's the tagline!

35:30.840 --> 35:35.560
Check out Story Break every week on MaximumFun.org or wherever you get your podcasts.

35:35.560 --> 35:36.600
How about another question?

35:37.320 --> 35:40.440
Absolutely. I am pregnant.

35:42.360 --> 35:47.480
Several of my friends are pregnant as well and are due close to the same time as I am.

35:47.480 --> 35:49.400
Our kids will be around each other enough

35:49.400 --> 35:52.120
that having the same names will be annoying and confusing.

35:52.120 --> 35:56.040
Do I announce my potential baby name to stake my claim,

35:56.040 --> 35:58.440
or keep my mouth shut to avoid poaching?

35:58.440 --> 36:02.360
That's from should I name it Bramble Pelt?

36:02.360 --> 36:03.560
No one would steal that.

36:05.000 --> 36:09.240
Yeah, this is not an issue, I feel like.

36:09.240 --> 36:10.920
There's so many names, aren't there?

36:10.920 --> 36:12.040
There's so many freaking names.

36:12.040 --> 36:13.480
So many names these days.

36:14.200 --> 36:16.280
I don't think it's going to be a big problem.

36:16.920 --> 36:19.400
And I think that your friends would understand that if you're like,

36:19.400 --> 36:22.840
I'm going with Dylan, and they're like, well, now I'm going with Dylan.

36:22.840 --> 36:25.640
They're like, okay, well, we can all agree that that's not okay.

36:25.640 --> 36:28.040
Like, that's, yeah.

36:28.040 --> 36:33.000
Yeah, it just, but at the same time, if they had poached the name that,

36:33.000 --> 36:35.560
like, I have friends who have babies around Henry's age.

36:35.560 --> 36:39.880
If they had said, now we're going to do a Henry right before we announced our name,

36:39.880 --> 36:41.640
that would be a big bummer, huh?

36:41.640 --> 36:43.160
It would really take the wind out of my sails.

36:43.160 --> 36:46.600
I, I, I, maybe you do need to stake your claim.

36:46.600 --> 36:51.320
Now, Griffin, you've got me thinking, like, saying the name out loud is more important.

36:51.320 --> 36:58.520
Yeah, or what you could do is you could do what, like, movie studios do

36:58.520 --> 37:01.640
and come up with, like, a fake name that you, you know,

37:01.640 --> 37:06.360
you send out all the film canisters listed as, like, oh, like Blue Harvest.

37:07.080 --> 37:07.720
What?

37:07.720 --> 37:12.200
Blue Harvest is a Star Wars empire, I think.

37:12.200 --> 37:13.240
Oh, damn it.

37:13.240 --> 37:15.640
That's what I was going to name my next kid, though, for real.

37:15.640 --> 37:17.080
You're going to name your kid Blue Harvest?

37:17.960 --> 37:21.960
Blue Harvest McElroy, middle name Jonathan.

37:21.960 --> 37:23.880
Blue Harvest is the first name, all one word.

37:25.720 --> 37:26.440
Here's what you do.

37:27.320 --> 37:33.320
Pick a name that you love and you're excited about and say it's Davis.

37:34.040 --> 37:36.040
It's a great, powerful name for a child.

37:36.040 --> 37:41.080
It calls to mind Jim Davis and all his great jokes.

37:42.120 --> 37:45.000
So you pick Davis and then your friend, you don't announce it,

37:45.000 --> 37:48.920
but your friend says, proud to announce coming 2019,

37:48.920 --> 37:51.880
the boy Davis, my boy, my boy Davis.

37:52.440 --> 37:56.600
And you say, well, shoot, but you want to get revenge on him,

37:57.240 --> 38:01.880
but you don't want to be so on the nose that you give him the same name and do a rhyme.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.320
Ooh, like Travis.

38:04.200 --> 38:05.800
Travis McElroy.

38:07.320 --> 38:08.520
Oh, you know what you do?

38:08.520 --> 38:11.560
You don't announce it, but, like, your friend's like,

38:11.560 --> 38:14.840
I'm going to go with Davis and you reach in your back pocket and what's that?

38:14.840 --> 38:17.000
It's an envelope that you mailed to yourself.

38:17.000 --> 38:17.320
Got to.

38:17.320 --> 38:21.000
Where you've written the name Davis inside and they're like, ah, damn it.

38:22.280 --> 38:24.360
You could do an arm wrestle for it.

38:24.920 --> 38:26.440
Arm wrestle for the fated Davis.

38:31.800 --> 38:34.600
I solve most of my problems these days with a good arm wrestle.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.960
That's great too, because you get exercise.

38:38.840 --> 38:41.800
You get exercise and you get stronger arms, which is good,

38:41.800 --> 38:45.560
because arm wrestling is fun and usually pretty low stakes,

38:45.560 --> 38:46.840
except for this one example.

38:46.840 --> 38:48.600
Usually it's pretty low stakes, though.

38:48.600 --> 38:51.720
But when you have an assailant coming at you and you need one strong arm,

38:51.720 --> 38:52.920
that's not going to be low stakes.

38:52.920 --> 38:54.440
That's the that's the real deal.

38:54.440 --> 38:55.560
That's the big show there.

38:57.960 --> 39:00.840
How come there are more fight scenes that are just arm wrestling?

39:01.480 --> 39:05.000
Yeah, or them just using their one big strong arm to fight everybody.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.080
They got huge and jacked from arm wrestling.

39:07.880 --> 39:09.320
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

39:09.320 --> 39:10.520
Yeah, I do actually.

39:10.520 --> 39:11.320
Thank you.

39:11.320 --> 39:14.360
Okay, so this one came in from Cool Ocelot.

39:14.360 --> 39:14.760
Thank you.

39:14.760 --> 39:16.920
It's Yahoo Answers user Abby who asks,

39:17.800 --> 39:22.840
can I trick somebody a Walmart into thinking I had a prize in the claw machine

39:22.840 --> 39:26.040
and it got dropped by the claw machine and I want to have it?

39:26.920 --> 39:28.120
That's really good.

39:29.320 --> 39:31.160
That is a perfect scam.

39:31.160 --> 39:34.440
Yeah, what would be the utility of this, do you think?

39:36.680 --> 39:38.520
Get stuffies.

39:38.520 --> 39:40.200
Hmm.

39:40.200 --> 39:43.960
Maybe it's one of those claw machines where there's like vouchers inside.

39:43.960 --> 39:47.560
Oh, or an iPod Nano and the claw picks it up,

39:47.560 --> 39:49.560
but then it falls before it goes in the hole.

39:49.560 --> 39:53.880
And then you call over a Walmart employee and say,

39:53.880 --> 40:00.520
hey, just so you know, the claw had the iPod Nano in its grasp

40:00.520 --> 40:03.240
and there must have been a malfunction or a glitch

40:03.240 --> 40:05.800
or some sort of hardware flaw because it fell.

40:05.800 --> 40:08.520
It fell out of the hand before it could go in the prize hole.

40:08.520 --> 40:11.240
So I'm wondering what my sort of like recompense is.

40:12.600 --> 40:13.720
What's our next step here?

40:13.720 --> 40:14.600
What's the next step?

40:14.600 --> 40:17.320
You tell me, do I write a letter to the claws company

40:17.320 --> 40:20.120
or is this a manager that can come in

40:20.120 --> 40:22.440
and just fish that iPod Nano out of there for me?

40:22.440 --> 40:23.720
Because the claw fucking had it.

40:25.000 --> 40:25.880
I don't know what to say.

40:25.880 --> 40:27.560
If you watch the tape, it was there.

40:28.360 --> 40:30.680
Like it was locked and it dropped it.

40:30.680 --> 40:32.440
I didn't drop it.

40:32.440 --> 40:33.560
I didn't drop it.

40:33.560 --> 40:34.520
I did my job.

40:34.520 --> 40:37.480
I told the claw where to go and it went there,

40:37.480 --> 40:39.800
but then it fucked up by dropping it.

40:39.800 --> 40:41.320
Yeah, and it had it.

40:41.320 --> 40:43.800
And you know, here's what I would tell the Walmart employee.

40:43.800 --> 40:45.960
If I was going through the checkout line

40:45.960 --> 40:49.080
and the person checking me out dropped like my carton of eggs,

40:49.080 --> 40:51.800
I feel like you all would get me another carton of eggs.

40:52.360 --> 40:56.520
And this claw machine is your employee and it dropped.

40:56.520 --> 40:58.040
This is still a shop, isn't it?

40:58.680 --> 41:03.000
I bought, excuse me, I bought a stuffed animal

41:03.000 --> 41:04.680
for this vending machine

41:04.680 --> 41:08.520
and just when the claw was over my selection,

41:08.520 --> 41:12.920
it dropped it and this machine is defective.

41:13.480 --> 41:15.000
Listen, if this was a gumball machine

41:15.000 --> 41:16.360
and I put my quarter in and I turned it

41:16.360 --> 41:17.880
and no gumball would come out,

41:17.880 --> 41:20.440
you would open it up and give me a gumball, right?

41:20.440 --> 41:21.720
How is this any different?

41:21.720 --> 41:24.120
Sure, it's got a few more moving parts,

41:24.120 --> 41:25.800
but it's a vending machine, isn't it?

41:25.800 --> 41:26.520
Like at this point,

41:26.520 --> 41:29.720
the person has definitely given you a stuffed animal, right?

41:29.720 --> 41:30.280
For sure.

41:30.280 --> 41:32.440
Yeah, but now it's a principal thing, Justin.

41:32.440 --> 41:34.440
Now I have to continue explaining my,

41:34.440 --> 41:36.360
yes, listen, I appreciate that you've given me

41:36.360 --> 41:38.520
this hilarious Bart Simpson toy,

41:38.520 --> 41:41.080
but I need to continue explaining to you

41:41.080 --> 41:43.400
why I was disappointed by this interaction.

41:43.400 --> 41:46.360
I bought that SpongeBob in there with my own quarter

41:46.360 --> 41:48.120
and made the claw go where it needed to go,

41:48.120 --> 41:50.520
but then as it was retrieving it to the prize hole,

41:50.520 --> 41:52.920
a large boy did bump into the machine

41:52.920 --> 41:53.800
and made the claw drop.

41:53.800 --> 41:57.720
So is that an act of God for the insurance purposes

41:57.720 --> 41:59.000
or what's the deal there?

41:59.000 --> 42:01.640
I had promised this to my nephew, William,

42:01.640 --> 42:03.800
and now he will be so disappointed

42:03.800 --> 42:07.080
if you do not get me that SpongeBob.

42:07.080 --> 42:09.400
Also, have you seen my nephew anywhere?

42:09.400 --> 42:11.560
I got distracted by this vending machine.

42:12.200 --> 42:13.320
I'm very concerned.

42:14.040 --> 42:16.040
Y'all ever see those boys-

42:16.040 --> 42:17.880
Oh no, William's inside the machine.

42:17.880 --> 42:19.320
Well, I was just about to say,

42:19.320 --> 42:22.120
y'all ever seen those boys that do get inside the machine?

42:22.120 --> 42:23.640
And it does happen for real.

42:24.360 --> 42:27.720
It just seems like the machine shouldn't be built

42:27.720 --> 42:29.720
in a way that would allow that, huh?

42:29.720 --> 42:31.560
Yeah, it also seems like they should have a way

42:31.560 --> 42:34.200
to get the kid out without using the claw.

42:34.200 --> 42:35.400
It's fucked up, right?

42:35.400 --> 42:37.080
That kid's gonna have claw-based nightmares

42:37.080 --> 42:37.960
for the rest of its life,

42:37.960 --> 42:40.600
what with all of its grasping and grabbing at the child,

42:40.600 --> 42:42.040
trying to lift it into the prize hole.

42:42.840 --> 42:45.560
And also, you start to get in,

42:45.560 --> 42:47.640
you're like, well, I put $5 worth of quarters in

42:47.640 --> 42:49.240
and I still haven't gotten that kid out.

42:49.800 --> 42:51.720
I'm out of quarters, I don't know what to do.

42:51.720 --> 42:54.120
How fucking tight would it be if David Blaine was like,

42:54.120 --> 42:55.400
y'all, I got a new stunt.

42:56.120 --> 42:57.800
I might get up in this claw machine

42:57.800 --> 43:01.320
and that'll be my new house for four years.

43:01.320 --> 43:03.240
And then you just point to which toy you want

43:03.240 --> 43:03.880
and I'll drop it down the street.

43:03.880 --> 43:05.160
I'll just drop it in, baby.

43:05.160 --> 43:05.560
No problem at all.

43:05.560 --> 43:06.920
It's not a big deal.

43:06.920 --> 43:08.600
David Blaine, get out of there.

43:08.600 --> 43:09.880
I can't.

43:09.880 --> 43:11.560
I can't, sadly.

43:11.560 --> 43:14.280
But do you want, I don't know, what do we got here?

43:14.280 --> 43:16.120
Oh, is that a copy of Grand Theft Auto?

43:16.120 --> 43:17.320
Here you go.

43:17.320 --> 43:20.760
My adult body's too big for the small claw, unfortunately,

43:20.760 --> 43:22.680
so I live in here and I will die in here.

43:22.680 --> 43:25.000
You can maybe fish my individual bones out of here

43:25.000 --> 43:26.360
in what, 50 years or so.

43:26.360 --> 43:28.520
My magical bones.

43:28.520 --> 43:30.840
Oh, nice, I got David Blaine's skull.

43:30.840 --> 43:32.040
That's the big one.

43:32.040 --> 43:33.720
I'm gonna scry with it.

43:33.720 --> 43:36.920
Excuse me, I had David Blaine's skull in the claw

43:36.920 --> 43:38.440
and it dropped and fell.

43:38.440 --> 43:39.960
So I'm gonna need you to get that for me.

43:40.760 --> 43:41.240
Thank you.

43:42.280 --> 43:43.480
Kermit, do you have a Yahoo's?

43:43.480 --> 43:44.760
I thought we didn't do a Yahoo.

43:45.480 --> 43:48.200
I literally just did one, but we can do another one.

43:48.200 --> 43:49.560
No, I'll do a question.

43:49.560 --> 43:51.880
You're right, I forgot that we had spun that off of Yahoo.

43:51.880 --> 43:53.720
I work in a trendy tech startup.

43:53.720 --> 43:57.560
I just got back from vacation to discover

43:57.560 --> 43:59.800
that the owner of the company has installed speakers

43:59.800 --> 44:02.200
throughout the office to play elevator music

44:02.200 --> 44:04.600
in an effort to combat our noise problem.

44:05.240 --> 44:07.320
It has only made things exponentially worse.

44:07.320 --> 44:09.000
However, we discovered that we have access

44:09.000 --> 44:11.240
to the audio input for these speakers.

44:11.240 --> 44:15.720
Brothers, what music or sounds can I play

44:16.840 --> 44:19.320
to cause enough chaos that the owner removes

44:19.320 --> 44:21.080
the speakers for good?

44:21.080 --> 44:24.680
That's from disgruntled employee in Florida.

44:25.800 --> 44:26.840
Can I ask a question?

44:26.840 --> 44:29.320
Ask her, when you say noise problem,

44:29.320 --> 44:32.600
do you mean like employees talking to one another?

44:32.600 --> 44:35.160
Yeah, they don't actually, they say our noise problem

44:35.160 --> 44:38.360
as though we at some point have been clued in

44:38.360 --> 44:40.280
as to what this noise problem is.

44:40.280 --> 44:42.440
Like this is our first time hearing about it.

44:42.440 --> 44:45.160
So I am not sure what exactly they're referring to.

44:45.720 --> 44:47.400
When we took BB trick or treating,

44:47.400 --> 44:49.880
we got into the car and we were driving

44:49.880 --> 44:52.760
to a friend's house where we all went together

44:52.760 --> 44:54.120
and took our kids together.

44:54.120 --> 44:56.200
And Teresa said, you know,

44:56.200 --> 45:00.280
oh, there's a Halloween station on SiriusXM

45:00.280 --> 45:01.240
and she flipped to it.

45:01.880 --> 45:04.920
And it was just spooky sound effects.

45:05.640 --> 45:06.760
It wasn't like music.

45:06.760 --> 45:08.200
It was just spooky sound effects.

45:08.200 --> 45:09.240
Nah, that's good.

45:09.240 --> 45:11.400
Play it all the time, not just at Halloween.

45:11.400 --> 45:14.440
Cause things can be spooky even when it's not Halloween, y'all.

45:14.440 --> 45:20.920
I, we had a great, this great cat over at Vox in the olden days

45:22.120 --> 45:24.120
who I believe was on our video team.

45:24.120 --> 45:27.080
And they had a system like this in the bathroom

45:27.640 --> 45:29.000
that they had rigged.

45:29.880 --> 45:32.040
And they actually recorded their own,

45:33.240 --> 45:36.440
their own radio station for people to enjoy

45:36.440 --> 45:39.080
in the bathroom called Bathtunes,

45:39.080 --> 45:40.840
if my memory serves me correctly.

45:40.840 --> 45:44.280
And they would record interviews with people in the office.

45:44.280 --> 45:47.720
And play them in this bathroom radio station.

45:49.960 --> 45:51.560
And they of course had their own songs

45:51.560 --> 45:54.040
that they had programmed in to this radio station

45:54.040 --> 45:55.640
that they were sort of running.

45:55.640 --> 45:58.360
But they had also put in a lot of different interviews

45:58.360 --> 46:01.480
with different employees that was for Bathtunes.

46:02.360 --> 46:04.440
So I think if you want to get a little more creative with it,

46:04.440 --> 46:07.240
you could always run your own pirate radio station

46:07.240 --> 46:08.920
about the office comings and goings.

46:08.920 --> 46:09.800
And you know what I found?

46:09.800 --> 46:14.360
I actually have a pretty good experience with,

46:14.360 --> 46:15.960
if you do things like this that make your,

46:15.960 --> 46:17.800
especially like a tech startup,

46:17.800 --> 46:19.720
that make it, or like a tech, you know,

46:19.720 --> 46:20.840
like a Trinity tech company.

46:20.840 --> 46:24.040
If you do things like this that make your office seem like fun

46:24.040 --> 46:26.280
and quirky, like a cool place to work,

46:26.280 --> 46:29.480
sometimes it can get you out of doing real work.

46:29.480 --> 46:31.160
When I, when I was at Best Buy,

46:31.160 --> 46:34.280
I used to try to sell karaoke machines

46:34.280 --> 46:39.320
by setting up a playlist and doing karaoke

46:39.320 --> 46:41.960
by myself in the middle of the Best Buy.

46:41.960 --> 46:44.200
Just like doing whatever tunes I felt like,

46:44.200 --> 46:45.480
trying to sell karaoke machines

46:45.480 --> 46:48.680
and the ill-fated music streaming service, Rhapsody,

46:48.680 --> 46:50.200
if memory serves correctly.

46:50.200 --> 46:53.800
So I would try to sell the two karaoke machines

46:53.800 --> 46:54.520
that we had in the store.

46:54.520 --> 46:57.800
I would open one of them, completely void its worth,

46:57.800 --> 46:59.160
and then I would just do karaoke.

46:59.160 --> 46:59.640
But you know what?

46:59.640 --> 47:01.480
It made it seem like a fun place to be

47:01.480 --> 47:02.760
and a fun place to shop.

47:02.760 --> 47:05.160
And I got out of working for like four hours.

47:05.160 --> 47:06.840
So maybe you could swing something like that.

47:06.840 --> 47:09.400
Have you thought about a fart?

47:10.120 --> 47:11.240
But hear me out.

47:11.240 --> 47:13.400
It would start out really quiet.

47:14.200 --> 47:15.800
And so people would look around and be like,

47:15.800 --> 47:18.120
uh-oh, and then the next day you'd bump it up

47:18.120 --> 47:19.240
like half a decibel.

47:19.800 --> 47:21.160
And you would keep doing that

47:21.160 --> 47:23.080
and see how long it took for people to realize

47:23.080 --> 47:24.840
it's coming from the speakers above you.

47:24.840 --> 47:27.080
And maybe you record it with like a binaural microphone

47:27.080 --> 47:29.000
so it sounds really realistic.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.720
And you could maybe choose which speaker it kind of favors.

47:31.720 --> 47:34.120
So people are like, uh-oh, it's definitely uncounting.

47:34.120 --> 47:35.720
But then the next day it really sounds like

47:35.720 --> 47:39.080
it's coming from, you know, customer relations or whatever.

47:39.080 --> 47:40.520
That's my first funny joke.

47:40.520 --> 47:42.760
My second one is what if it played,

47:44.040 --> 47:47.240
what if it played the pizza music from Spider-Man 2

47:47.240 --> 47:48.760
that it played the game

47:48.760 --> 47:52.680
and it just constantly got faster every time it finished.

47:52.680 --> 47:56.920
And that would help with your efficiency as a company

47:56.920 --> 47:58.440
because everybody's going to be working so fast

47:58.440 --> 48:00.200
because of the fast pizza music.

48:00.200 --> 48:02.040
Can I, Griffin, can I take your idea

48:02.040 --> 48:03.320
and spin it a little bit?

48:03.320 --> 48:03.820
Classic.

48:03.820 --> 48:05.100
Mm-hmm.

48:05.100 --> 48:06.620
What if you took the fart idea, right?

48:06.620 --> 48:07.820
And what you did is you started-

48:07.820 --> 48:09.020
Oh, I thought you were going to do the pizza idea.

48:09.020 --> 48:10.140
This is a better one.

48:10.140 --> 48:12.140
Either one works really for this idea.

48:12.140 --> 48:15.500
You start it at a like really, really incredibly low

48:15.500 --> 48:17.740
imperceptible volume and it's a constant.

48:18.300 --> 48:20.540
And then you just slowly, and I mean slowly,

48:20.540 --> 48:23.820
this might take weeks, increase the volume

48:23.820 --> 48:25.020
little by little by little

48:25.020 --> 48:27.980
until eventually everyone's so used to it

48:27.980 --> 48:30.540
that they don't even notice it till they leave the building

48:30.540 --> 48:33.340
and now the outside is too much for them to bear

48:33.340 --> 48:35.180
because of the eternal quiet.

48:35.180 --> 48:37.020
I miss my wife's farting noises.

48:37.020 --> 48:38.220
I can't sleep without them.

48:38.220 --> 48:44.060
I feel embarrassed about the farting noises.

48:44.060 --> 48:45.260
I feel like it's below me.

48:45.820 --> 48:48.140
The Spider-Man 2 one was like a funny idea

48:48.140 --> 48:49.500
and like a really good reference.

48:49.500 --> 48:51.900
Yeah, yeah, everyone was crazy about it.

48:51.900 --> 48:53.740
Oh, I've got one.

48:53.740 --> 48:55.340
Can I save it from your fart?

48:55.340 --> 48:56.540
Can I save it, Griffin?

48:56.540 --> 48:58.380
I mean, I kind of already did with Lincoln's Spider-Man,

48:58.380 --> 48:58.880
but go ahead.

48:58.880 --> 49:00.800
What if you made it just a recording

49:00.800 --> 49:03.200
of different voices of people in the office

49:03.200 --> 49:05.040
calling out your boss's name?

49:05.040 --> 49:05.840
Hmm.

49:05.840 --> 49:07.840
Oh, they're all over the place then.

49:08.480 --> 49:08.960
Yeah.

49:08.960 --> 49:10.080
That's amazing, Travis.

49:10.080 --> 49:10.960
Good job.

49:10.960 --> 49:14.080
I thought that that was going to be so much horseshit,

49:14.080 --> 49:15.680
but it turned into something.

49:16.240 --> 49:17.040
Thank you.

49:17.920 --> 49:18.720
Yeah, no problem.

49:18.720 --> 49:22.640
Or, oh, just get a recording of whatever the noise problem is

49:22.640 --> 49:24.480
that you have in your office and play that.

49:25.200 --> 49:27.200
Play that over again over the speakers.

49:27.200 --> 49:28.720
Over again over the speakers.

49:28.720 --> 49:29.840
What is the noise problem?

49:29.840 --> 49:32.000
Can we get some clarity, please?

49:32.560 --> 49:35.760
It's like playing the pizza theme music outside so loud.

49:36.960 --> 49:38.320
And the only way to cancel it out

49:38.320 --> 49:40.320
is to play the opposite of it.

49:41.600 --> 49:44.720
Could you play the opening four bars of Amber by 311?

49:44.720 --> 49:48.240
But every time it gets deeper.

49:52.320 --> 49:55.600
If you play Santeria at full volume

49:55.600 --> 49:57.600
enough times in a circuit,

49:57.600 --> 50:01.360
eventually so many people will quit that you will be the boss.

50:01.360 --> 50:02.880
Is the enough times once?

50:06.160 --> 50:08.720
Now listen, that's not allowed.

50:11.040 --> 50:14.480
Hey, hey, we don't joke like that on this podcast.

50:14.480 --> 50:16.080
That's not allowed.

50:16.080 --> 50:17.280
Have we done an hour yet?

50:17.840 --> 50:19.520
Yeah, folks, that's an hour.

50:19.520 --> 50:24.560
Thank you so much for joining us

50:24.560 --> 50:28.720
for this episode of the podcast.

50:28.720 --> 50:30.400
I wanna say stop, stop.

50:30.400 --> 50:33.200
I wanna say happy birthday to both of my beloved brothers.

50:33.200 --> 50:35.600
They turn ages tomorrow.

50:35.600 --> 50:36.640
Thank you.

50:36.640 --> 50:37.760
The day we're recording this.

50:38.560 --> 50:41.040
What's it gonna be, 37, 34?

50:41.040 --> 50:42.960
Nope, close, 35, 38.

50:42.960 --> 50:44.160
Oh my God.

50:45.200 --> 50:45.600
Okay.

50:46.320 --> 50:47.680
That's so high.

50:47.680 --> 50:50.480
Hi, all right, thank you.

50:50.480 --> 50:53.120
I really like 35 as a number.

50:53.120 --> 50:54.800
Yeah, you can finally go for president,

50:54.800 --> 50:57.040
which apparently anybody can do.

50:57.040 --> 50:59.920
And happy birthday, boys.

50:59.920 --> 51:01.120
I love you both so much.

51:01.120 --> 51:06.640
And I'm glad that you just are here with me

51:06.640 --> 51:09.200

51:09.200 --> 51:11.920
So celebrate one, pour one out five days ago

51:11.920 --> 51:13.760
when you hear this for Justin and Travis.

51:14.400 --> 51:16.320
Titans among boys.

51:16.320 --> 51:21.520
Wow, what a beautiful tribute to us,

51:21.520 --> 51:23.120
to me and Travis both.

51:24.080 --> 51:25.520
We appreciate it, Griffin, thank you.

51:26.560 --> 51:28.000
I must have very excited-

51:28.000 --> 51:29.680
Stop, do you maybe wanna say something about me?

51:32.480 --> 51:33.840
Do you maybe wanna say something about me?

51:33.840 --> 51:35.360
Happy birthday to Griffin.

51:35.360 --> 51:37.920
Happy birthday to Griffin, of course.

51:37.920 --> 51:40.560
Can you say I'm a Titan among boys?

51:40.560 --> 51:42.960
You're a Titan among boys.

51:42.960 --> 51:45.440
This is the end of the podcast, of course,

51:45.440 --> 51:48.240
where the words are sure to stop any second now.

51:50.480 --> 51:51.360
We promise.

51:51.360 --> 51:53.440
We promise, we can assure you of this.

51:54.720 --> 51:58.320
I don't wanna, I don't have anything to promote, okay?

51:58.320 --> 51:59.760
Okay, was that just that?

51:59.760 --> 52:01.920

52:04.720 --> 52:06.640

52:27.920 --> 52:31.200
where you can decide between a dog with human hands

52:31.200 --> 52:32.480
or a cat with a human face.

52:33.040 --> 52:33.520
Oh yeah.

52:33.520 --> 52:34.240
They are so good.

52:34.240 --> 52:35.200
Louis Zong made them.

52:35.200 --> 52:36.800
They're my favorite shit ever.

52:36.800 --> 52:38.960
But you're only gonna have till the 15th

52:39.680 --> 52:42.800
to order these shirts is a very limited run

52:42.800 --> 52:45.840
because the joke won't be funny after then.

52:45.840 --> 52:48.320
That's about how long the expiration date is on this.

52:48.320 --> 52:49.840
So go get it.

52:49.840 --> 52:51.600
And also coming out November 16th,

52:51.600 --> 52:54.160

53:08.320 --> 53:10.560
I just wanna say apologize for being sick

53:10.560 --> 53:12.000
for a month and a half now.

53:12.000 --> 53:12.640
Wow.

53:12.640 --> 53:14.320
On every recording that we've done.

53:14.320 --> 53:15.680
It's not a permanent thing.

53:15.680 --> 53:18.000
Eventually my body's gonna beat it and-

53:18.560 --> 53:19.680
You say that, Griffin,

53:19.680 --> 53:21.760
but I've known you since you were a child.

53:21.760 --> 53:22.560
Yeah, yeah.

53:23.840 --> 53:25.760
Yeah, I've had some nose issues

53:25.760 --> 53:27.600
and it must be bad to listen to.

53:27.600 --> 53:29.040
There's one episode where everybody thought

53:29.040 --> 53:32.480
I had been replaced and I'll never tell.

53:32.480 --> 53:33.920
Do you guys want the final Yahoo?

53:33.920 --> 53:34.320
Yep.

53:34.320 --> 53:34.560
Yeah.

53:35.360 --> 53:38.640
I didn't pick one, but I'll use one of the other ones.

53:39.520 --> 53:40.640
Yeah, this one's pretty good.

53:40.640 --> 53:42.560
It was sent in by level 9,000 Yadru Dru,

53:42.560 --> 53:43.360
Dru Davenport.

53:44.320 --> 53:45.120
Thanks, Dru.

53:45.120 --> 53:48.640
It's Yadru Answers user, Guy, who asks,

53:50.400 --> 53:52.160
when is Santa's birthday?

53:54.320 --> 53:56.160
My name is Justin McElroy.

53:56.160 --> 53:57.440
I'm Travis McElroy.

53:57.440 --> 53:58.480
I'm Griffin McElroy.

53:58.480 --> 53:59.680
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

53:59.680 --> 54:13.200
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

54:30.640 --> 54:33.520
You wake up, eat a tasty meal with some new friends,

54:33.520 --> 54:34.560
some old friends,

54:34.560 --> 54:36.480
maybe the host of your favorite podcasts.

54:36.480 --> 54:39.200
After that, it's a couple of inspiring classes,

54:39.200 --> 54:41.040
spectacular podcast tapings,

54:41.040 --> 54:42.720
a hilarious stand-up showcase,

54:42.720 --> 54:44.720
a dance party, and more.

54:44.720 --> 54:45.840
And s'mores!

54:45.840 --> 54:48.080
All of this can be yours at Max Fun Con,
