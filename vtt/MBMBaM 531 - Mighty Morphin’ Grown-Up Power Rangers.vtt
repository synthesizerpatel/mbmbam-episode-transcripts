00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.800
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

00:48.800 --> 00:52.400
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:52.400 --> 01:04.400
And me? Well, I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

01:04.400 --> 01:09.520
I'm your youngest one, Griffin McElroy. Why do we laugh? We record these on Thursdays,

01:09.520 --> 01:13.440
we have no fucking idea what kind of a weekend ahead of us we have.

01:13.440 --> 01:17.840
Laughter may not be the order of the day come Monday afternoon,

01:17.840 --> 01:21.920
but I don't know, man. May as well laugh when you can, right?

01:21.920 --> 01:30.400
Hey, all things considered, not a bad week. All things considered, not a bad week.

01:30.400 --> 01:38.400
Comparatively, all things considered, if you were to take all things into consideration,

01:38.400 --> 01:45.760
not a bad week, here's what I was going to say. If you told me one calendar year ago

01:45.760 --> 01:51.680
that the week that contained a day that I woke up with a fever thinking I had a deadly virus,

01:51.680 --> 01:56.160
then got tested for that deadly virus, and I would think of that week as a pretty good week.

01:56.160 --> 01:59.360
Yeah. I would have not believed what you were saying.

01:59.360 --> 02:02.560
I would not have believed it, but that situation did transpire.

02:02.560 --> 02:08.000
Yeah. Everything's fine. But still, pretty good week.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.480
You know, if you had told me when I was a young lad of, say, eight or nine,

02:12.480 --> 02:19.840
that there would come a week where a fly landing on someone's head was national news,

02:19.840 --> 02:22.320
I would have laughed in your face. So fucking funny.

02:22.320 --> 02:24.000
And he landed there. I would have laughed in your face.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.240
The bug landed there because it was shit, and he smelled the shit,

02:30.240 --> 02:32.720
and he wanted to eat it and barf on it, which is what flies do.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.960
That's pretty much what everyone's going with.

02:34.960 --> 02:37.040
Oh, shit. It's fucking good, man.

02:37.040 --> 02:41.040
I do want to point out two things. One, still very bad things

02:41.040 --> 02:46.080
happen during the week. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:46.080 --> 02:53.120
It was a terrible, terrible, terrible week. But also, it's Thursday at 1.42 central time,

02:53.120 --> 02:54.800
which is the only time zone that matters to me.

02:55.760 --> 02:59.600
By the time this episode comes out, there are three days, dudes,

02:59.600 --> 03:04.480
where totally not righteous stuff can, will…

03:04.480 --> 03:06.320
Yeah, will happen.

03:06.320 --> 03:10.080
Yeah, we're recording this several days before, so absolutely.

03:10.080 --> 03:12.960
So I don't know why you guys are calling this fucking wild.

03:12.960 --> 03:13.440
I guess it's…

03:14.320 --> 03:16.800
Calendar. I'm going by calendar. Since last Thursday.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.720
Thursday to Thursday. Pretty bad week.

03:18.720 --> 03:26.640
Now, let me say this. If we were able to cut and paste this week into, say, 2011,

03:26.640 --> 03:30.240
this would have been the worst week of 2011. You know what I mean?

03:30.960 --> 03:36.880
That's what I'm talking about. But here, in 2020…

03:36.880 --> 03:40.080
A fly landed on our American vice president's head.

03:41.200 --> 03:45.520
Wouldn't that have been ironic? Where it landed on Joe Biden's head back in 2010?

03:45.520 --> 03:49.840
Oh, now the dots are starting to connect. Thank you, Travis.

03:49.840 --> 03:52.720
The fly was a little tiny drone.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.800
That's wild to think about.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.240
But it's definitely true.

03:56.960 --> 03:58.560
Now, here's what I'm wondering.

03:58.560 --> 03:58.800
Yeah.

03:59.440 --> 04:04.240
Are we going to say, man, I hope this isn't true, but like in 2030,

04:04.240 --> 04:08.880
we'll look back on this week and be like, no one can withstand this.

04:08.880 --> 04:11.520
You're probably right. Or maybe we'll look back and be like,

04:11.520 --> 04:13.360
there's no way that week happened.

04:13.360 --> 04:16.880
If I'm still allowed to think in 2030, I will consider that a success.

04:16.880 --> 04:17.840
That's fair.

04:17.840 --> 04:19.920
That will be a high watermark.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.040
That is fair. That is fair.

04:21.040 --> 04:23.760
This is my brother, my brother, me. It's the Vice Show for the Modern Era.

04:23.760 --> 04:25.680
We're so happy to be here with you.

04:25.680 --> 04:27.360
We got a special guest, the fly!

04:27.360 --> 04:28.400
Haha, here he is.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.120
I can't believe we…

04:29.120 --> 04:35.920
I landed on the dude's head because the things he's saying is total bullshit.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.600
So are you voting for Joe Biden?

04:38.400 --> 04:43.200
I'm actually, as all bugs are, a registered libertarian.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.680
I've heard Jorgensen like Ken Bone.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.200
I did have a thought, you guys.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.920
Can you imagine, here we are four years later,

04:51.920 --> 04:55.440
to be Ken Bone and to look at the news and realize

04:55.440 --> 05:00.800
I share the same amount of like public affection as a fly does now.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.160
Like in 2016, he was the fly.

05:04.160 --> 05:06.320
The fly is the Ken Bone of 2020.

05:06.320 --> 05:08.480
The fly is the Ken Bone, the Ken Bone is the fly.

05:09.120 --> 05:11.280
That must be a sobering realization.

05:11.280 --> 05:12.400
I cannot believe…

05:13.200 --> 05:15.920
Can we briefly, I'm just going to briefly talk about Ken Bone,

05:15.920 --> 05:18.800
who is, by the way, not a good person.

05:18.800 --> 05:19.200
No, okay.

05:19.200 --> 05:22.560
Judging by the Reddit history, not a good person, Ken Bone.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.240
So I want to say that upfront established.

05:24.240 --> 05:29.440
Second thing I want to say, can you imagine there was a person

05:30.000 --> 05:33.920
who was so hee-haw stupid that they couldn't pick

05:33.920 --> 05:37.040
who they wanted to be the president and a real reporter,

05:37.040 --> 05:39.040
a paid reporter was like,

05:39.040 --> 05:43.520
I have got to check back in with that dude and see where his head was at.

05:43.520 --> 05:48.960
He was so, so absolutely out of his melon that he couldn't make a decision.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.480
I wonder where his head is at now.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.400
This is a big thinker.

05:52.400 --> 05:53.680
I got to see where he's at.

05:53.680 --> 05:54.400
I got to see where he's at.

05:54.400 --> 05:55.200
A free thinker.

05:55.840 --> 05:57.040
A free thinker.

05:57.040 --> 05:58.560
Think of it that way, Chewce.

05:58.560 --> 06:01.440
He's free to take his vote and flush it right on the fucking toilet.

06:01.440 --> 06:01.760
Okay.

06:01.760 --> 06:05.360
Ken Bone also probably doesn't…

06:05.360 --> 06:07.680
He probably only owns red sweaters, right?

06:07.680 --> 06:10.160
At this point, he's a full-blown…

06:10.160 --> 06:10.720
Yeah.

06:10.720 --> 06:12.000
He's a full-blown bone.

06:12.720 --> 06:13.760
Full-blown bone.

06:13.760 --> 06:15.520
That's his thing, you know what I mean?

06:15.520 --> 06:18.080
Like, he only knows how to be Ken Bone.

06:18.080 --> 06:19.760
I hope he's doing the con circuit.

06:19.760 --> 06:20.480
Anyway, listen…

06:20.480 --> 06:23.280
I hope he's not because if he is, I'm going to have to see him

06:23.280 --> 06:24.080
and I'm going to have to say,

06:24.080 --> 06:25.440
I wish they could have gotten the fly.

06:27.040 --> 06:28.880
It's too bad the fly is too popular.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.040
God, we could do more fly stuff,

06:31.040 --> 06:32.560
but you know it's going to be on SNL

06:32.560 --> 06:35.360
and this will come out after I smell the funky that we're beating.

06:35.360 --> 06:36.240
Well, let's call it.

06:36.240 --> 06:37.200
Oh, let's call it.

06:37.200 --> 06:37.920
This will be fun.

06:37.920 --> 06:40.960
We're recording this three days before then.

06:41.520 --> 06:42.640
What do you think is going to…

06:42.640 --> 06:44.960
I think it'll be probably a weekend update bit.

06:45.760 --> 06:46.640
Fuck.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.360
Oh, no, no, no.

06:47.360 --> 06:48.400
It's in the intro.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.280
Oh, really?

06:49.280 --> 06:54.320
They zoom in on the fly and it's like Fred Armisen is back to be the fly.

06:54.320 --> 06:55.120
Oh, shit.

06:55.120 --> 06:56.240
Oh, that's good.

06:56.240 --> 06:56.960
That's good.

06:56.960 --> 07:02.000
What if it's like a Godfather kind of thing where they got Jim Carrey.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.080
He's playing Jabiden and Jabiden is like sitting in his desk,

07:06.080 --> 07:09.040
but it's like, you know, one downward light and the fly comes

07:09.040 --> 07:10.560
and Jabiden's like, you did it.

07:10.560 --> 07:11.200
The thing I…

07:11.200 --> 07:13.200
Yeah, now what can I do for you?

07:13.920 --> 07:16.640
And the fly's like, I just want a big pile of shit.

07:16.640 --> 07:16.960
Yeah.

07:16.960 --> 07:19.120
Until like do rails up or whatever.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.640
I haven't seen Godfather.

07:21.280 --> 07:23.760
And then Jabiden's like, you got it.

07:23.760 --> 07:26.320
Live from New York, it's Saturday night.

07:26.320 --> 07:26.720
That's it.

07:26.720 --> 07:27.200
That's it.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.000
That's it.

07:28.000 --> 07:28.800
Didn't watch…

07:28.800 --> 07:31.760
Couldn't bring myself to watch Jim Carrey's Jabiden

07:32.560 --> 07:36.000
because I just saw the thumbnail image and I was like, I don't think…

07:36.000 --> 07:43.120
My anxiety over this election is so high that I do not need my mayonnaise ventura in there,

07:43.120 --> 07:47.360
sort of poking about my neurons, getting them all twisted up, getting me…

07:47.360 --> 07:51.520
I mean, busting my gut, busting my family's gut for sure.

07:51.520 --> 07:54.640
I guess I just worry that if I saw it, it would bust my gut so hard

07:54.640 --> 07:56.800
that all my intestines would spill out.

07:56.800 --> 07:57.600
Yeah, happens sometimes.

07:57.600 --> 07:58.960
Which would be pretty spooky.

07:59.520 --> 07:59.760
Yeah.

07:59.760 --> 08:00.720
Happy Halloween, everybody.

08:01.600 --> 08:02.160
All right.

08:02.160 --> 08:03.120
Oh, the fly.

08:03.120 --> 08:05.440
Sexy the fly is going to be huge this Halloween.

08:05.440 --> 08:07.360
Oh my God.

08:07.360 --> 08:08.800
Sexy the fly.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.720
I mean, flies are already…

08:13.680 --> 08:14.480
What if they get…

08:14.480 --> 08:15.760
What if they get Goblin?

08:15.760 --> 08:16.480
Oh.

08:16.480 --> 08:16.960
Oh.

08:16.960 --> 08:18.000
What if they get Goblin though?

08:18.000 --> 08:20.160
What if they get Goblin?

08:20.160 --> 08:20.800
Okay, let's help.

08:21.680 --> 08:24.320
Last week, after working at my current job for nearly two and a half years,

08:24.320 --> 08:26.800
my boss finally granted me lockup privileges.

08:26.800 --> 08:27.280
Nice.

08:27.280 --> 08:30.160
That is, of course, if you haven't been in a job for a while,

08:30.160 --> 08:36.800
you are allowed to lock up insubordinate employees until they do things the Subway way.

08:36.800 --> 08:38.640
Right, in the boo-boo box.

08:39.360 --> 08:42.480
Yeah, which is also where they keep the vegetables.

08:43.040 --> 08:45.920
When he gave me the key, he said, now, don't you lose this.

08:45.920 --> 08:48.880
And throughout the week, he kept telling me to take good care of it.

08:48.880 --> 08:51.760
At the end of the last day, before I was going to open the store by myself for the first time,

08:51.760 --> 08:52.880
he said, you sure you're ready?

08:52.880 --> 08:54.320
You haven't lost the key?

08:54.320 --> 08:56.080
I got so annoyed that I kind of snapped.

08:56.080 --> 08:58.320
No, I haven't lost it since the last time you asked.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.800
Now, I'm sure you can tell where this is going.

09:00.800 --> 09:04.240
Because when I got home, I couldn't find the damn key anywhere.

09:04.960 --> 09:08.240
So please, how the hell do I tell my boss that I lost the freaking key?

09:09.840 --> 09:13.520
Do I just not open the store tomorrow and I hope he doesn't notice?

09:13.520 --> 09:17.680
How will I ever gain back his misplaced trust that's from lockdown and ashamed?

09:17.680 --> 09:20.480
Oh, you're never going to, you're never going to gain back that trust.

09:20.480 --> 09:26.880
How did you, how could you possibly have fucked this up so bad?

09:26.880 --> 09:28.320
So frustrated with you.

09:28.320 --> 09:28.720
You gotta-

09:28.720 --> 09:29.920
I'll tell you my theory.

09:29.920 --> 09:34.160
My theory, as you, like, when your boss handed it to you,

09:34.160 --> 09:37.200
it fell out of your pocket as you were leaving the room, like that long ago.

09:37.200 --> 09:39.120
And your boss picked it up and was like, well,

09:39.920 --> 09:42.880
I'm going to give them a fucking hard time about this.

09:42.880 --> 09:43.840
I love that.

09:43.840 --> 09:44.800
That's very possible.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.400
The boss knew the whole time.

09:46.400 --> 09:48.400
Oh yeah, or the boss stole it.

09:48.400 --> 09:50.320
Yeah, I mean-

09:50.320 --> 09:52.480
They caught me if you can, dear.

09:53.040 --> 09:56.160
I have a good, I mean, to use another film reference as a solution,

09:57.280 --> 09:58.320
it's Wonderful Life.

09:59.360 --> 09:59.680
Huh.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.560
Oh, your uncle Billy.

10:02.560 --> 10:07.280
Your uncle, your uncle Billy, you lost the key or the money or the key.

10:07.280 --> 10:11.200
And so George is like, um, this sucks.

10:11.200 --> 10:14.080
But then I'm fucked, I'm fucked, oh man.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.680
I'm fucked, you fucked me, Billy.

10:15.680 --> 10:16.800
I told my boss-

10:16.800 --> 10:17.520
You fucked me.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.240
Billy, Billy, I'm fucked.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.080
You make me look like a real fucking idiot.

10:23.360 --> 10:23.860
Billy.

10:25.120 --> 10:28.320
Well, well, well, well, you fucked me in the ass, Billy.

10:28.320 --> 10:31.040
Billy, I got kids, Billy, you fuck.

10:31.040 --> 10:31.760
I'm an angel.

10:31.760 --> 10:34.320
Billy, you're fucking me in front of my kids.

10:34.320 --> 10:39.440
I'm an angel sent by Jesus, but I can't even around all this.

10:39.440 --> 10:41.200
Billy, are you pulling my hair?

10:41.200 --> 10:41.920
Are you pulling my hair?

10:41.920 --> 10:44.160
Because I like to have my hair pulled when I get fucked, Billy.

10:47.440 --> 10:52.560
That was a long interruption for what is not going to be a very good idea.

10:52.560 --> 10:57.600
But I was saying that all the townspeople who you've helped with your generosity

10:57.600 --> 11:01.840
and selflessness over the years will come and give you their keys.

11:03.280 --> 11:06.160
Now, unless those townspeople live at the subway,

11:06.160 --> 11:07.280
girlfriend, it's not going to help.

11:07.280 --> 11:13.440
Well, I think that one of the keys will be close enough to fit that it'll open the door.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.320
That's true.

11:14.320 --> 11:16.960
You could use God's keys, which is what I call a brick.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.400
Okay.

11:18.400 --> 11:19.840
Smash that door in.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.360
And then when your boss comes, you say,

11:21.360 --> 11:24.880
I found it like this, boss, but I'm not leaving here until it gets repaired.

11:24.880 --> 11:28.960
And bad news, somebody stole the key too out of my pocket while I was picking up glass.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.600
What's bad is like, I was going to suggest that.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.200
So that is actually troubling.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.160
What, the smashing the window or the stealing the key?

11:36.160 --> 11:37.840
Smashing the window, you put a brick through the window,

11:37.840 --> 11:41.360
you reach around, you open it, and they're like, they got you.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.000
I'm sorry, boss, but they got you.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.120
They got you again.

11:45.120 --> 11:46.080
Classic prank.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.960
The old window brick.

11:50.080 --> 11:50.880
Can I do a Yahoo?

11:51.440 --> 11:52.000
Yeah, I'd love that.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.040
This one was sent in by Steven.

11:53.040 --> 11:53.520
Thank you, Steven.

11:53.520 --> 11:55.680
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

11:56.400 --> 11:57.680
Sorry, real quick to jump back.

11:57.680 --> 11:59.200
You should tell your boss you lost it

11:59.200 --> 12:04.880
because the satisfaction they'll feel at that will be so overwhelmingly positive for them.

12:04.880 --> 12:05.380
Yeah.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.160
Brandon asks, stupid Power Rangers question.

12:11.760 --> 12:12.480
Yeah.

12:12.480 --> 12:13.920
No such thing, but go on.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.760
There's no such thing as a stupid Power Rangers question.

12:17.760 --> 12:19.520
Just stupid people.

12:19.520 --> 12:21.200
Just stupid Power Rangers.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.080
Stupid actors.

12:22.880 --> 12:26.240
In the beginning of the show, when Zordon needs new Power Rangers,

12:26.240 --> 12:29.040
why did he ask for teenagers with attitudes?

12:29.040 --> 12:33.120
Wouldn't it be better to get some guys that have formal special ops training?

12:33.120 --> 12:35.120
It just seems irresponsible.

12:35.120 --> 12:35.600
No.

12:35.600 --> 12:36.960
Oh, God, that is a stupid...

12:36.960 --> 12:38.720
I'm sorry, that is a stupid question.

12:38.720 --> 12:43.600
Obviously, Zordon wanted to be able to train them himself, right?

12:43.600 --> 12:45.360
If you get people with special ops training,

12:45.360 --> 12:47.360
they're gonna do it the way they've been trained.

12:47.360 --> 12:53.040
Okay, but Zordon doesn't ever pop out of his hologram display and is like,

12:53.040 --> 12:56.640
let me show you teens how to do a real bicycle kick.

12:57.520 --> 13:00.640
This is where to put your hands to snap a man's neck.

13:00.640 --> 13:04.880
And that fucking robot's not teaching them how to do their moves.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.000
Alpha 5, no way.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.520
No way, so they just have their little power coins

13:09.520 --> 13:11.680
and that gives them all the training they need.

13:11.680 --> 13:13.680
Zordon doesn't teach them shit.

13:13.680 --> 13:18.000
So a little bit of endemic, systemic fighting knowledge

13:18.000 --> 13:24.880
in a stable adult with a 401k,

13:24.880 --> 13:33.680
like somebody who is financially independent and just very confident in themselves.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.280
Okay, Griffin, let's try that out.

13:35.280 --> 13:39.600
I'll get the adult with formal special ops training like I have

13:39.600 --> 13:45.200
and you are Zordon trying to recruit me to your Power Ranger group, I guess.

13:45.200 --> 13:53.840
Yes, okay, Toady, I am Zordon, I know that you know all kinds of cool fighting moves

13:53.840 --> 13:58.480
and you have a big job with the city and an apartment in the city.

13:59.120 --> 14:03.680
You are in a long-term dating relationship.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.120
Yeah, it's getting pretty serious.

14:05.120 --> 14:10.480
And your fighting abilities are, they exist and you can do them.

14:10.480 --> 14:11.360
Yes, I can.

14:11.360 --> 14:15.040
So Rita Repulsa is back and she's-

14:15.040 --> 14:19.200
She's got all of her gooey guys doing their bad stuff.

14:20.400 --> 14:21.600
Okay, what do you want me to do?

14:22.160 --> 14:26.960
Well, I'm going to, let me fucking finish.

14:26.960 --> 14:27.280
Okay.

14:27.840 --> 14:31.360
I have this little power coin and it lets you turn,

14:31.360 --> 14:35.760
it changes your clothes into different, like a superhero clothes

14:35.760 --> 14:39.200
and then you will get sometimes a dinosaur robot.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.920
Well, I like the dinosaur robot part, but like, what does it pay?

14:43.920 --> 14:48.240
I told you about the power coin and the dinosaur robot.

14:48.240 --> 14:52.560
No, I know that, but like, as you mentioned, I have an apartment, I need to pay rent.

14:52.560 --> 14:54.320
Like, what's the pay?

14:55.840 --> 14:58.320
Excuse me for a moment, Toady.

14:58.320 --> 14:58.800
Okay.

14:58.800 --> 15:02.480
Can my girlfriend's kids come hang out at the power base or whatever?

15:02.480 --> 15:06.480
Because sometimes I, and like, what's parking and like, what's the healthcare scenario?

15:06.480 --> 15:10.800
I actually watch them, she goes to night school, so I actually watch them a lot of the time.

15:10.800 --> 15:11.600
They're cool.

15:11.600 --> 15:15.520
Most, you can give them like a Paw Patrol coloring book and they'll be fine.

15:15.520 --> 15:16.800
They'll be fine.

15:16.800 --> 15:20.480
Or make them, what's it, power people or whatever?

15:20.480 --> 15:22.800
Yeah, can they be like tiny power people?

15:22.800 --> 15:24.560
Wait, why didn't I think of that?

15:24.560 --> 15:28.080
I can just make everyone on earth power people.

15:28.080 --> 15:31.280
And then, and then Rita's really fucked, isn't she?

15:31.280 --> 15:34.400
Well, have you thought about like restructuring, what's a robot for?

15:34.400 --> 15:36.000
I mean, no offense robot, but like-

15:36.000 --> 15:39.840
Well, sometimes the gooey guys get real big, Toady.

15:39.840 --> 15:40.640
Uh-huh.

15:40.640 --> 15:45.920
Do you think Zordon's ever like, you didn't lose your morpher, did you?

15:46.880 --> 15:47.360
Did you?

15:47.920 --> 15:48.560
Did you?

15:48.560 --> 15:49.600
Promise me.

15:49.600 --> 15:53.280
Yeah, sorry, my mom found my morpher and she used it.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.600
So now she's just flying a pterodactyl around.

15:55.600 --> 16:00.240
My mom found my morpher and she thought it was a bong and she grounded me, Zordon.

16:00.240 --> 16:02.480
Now I can't do any crime fighting today.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.240
So thanks so much, Zordon.

16:04.240 --> 16:05.040
Thanks so much.

16:05.040 --> 16:07.120
Please FaceTime my mom.

16:07.120 --> 16:10.000
Please take my mom on a date so she will-

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Zordon, I need you to seduce my mom.

16:12.640 --> 16:14.880
Zordon, seduce my mom so she'll leave the house

16:14.880 --> 16:17.600
and I can foil Rita Repulse's plans once again.

16:17.600 --> 16:19.600
How many fucking times do I have to tell you, dad?

16:19.600 --> 16:21.120
I mean, Zordon, oops.

16:22.160 --> 16:22.640
Sorry.

16:22.640 --> 16:22.960
Sorry.

16:22.960 --> 16:23.760
Sorry, Zordad.

16:26.640 --> 16:28.160
Happens to me all the time.

16:28.160 --> 16:29.280
Get the fuck out of here.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.200
Get out of here.

16:31.200 --> 16:32.400
What is the robot's name?

16:33.360 --> 16:34.320
Isn't it Alpha Five?

16:34.880 --> 16:36.400
It's Alpha Five, as I said.

16:36.400 --> 16:37.520
Okay, sure, sure, sure.

16:37.520 --> 16:42.480
Do you think that Power Rangers ever asked Zordon for help with their homework?

16:42.480 --> 16:43.040
Yeah.

16:43.040 --> 16:43.600
Yeah, probably.

16:43.600 --> 16:44.240
There's probably-

16:44.240 --> 16:45.360
And Alpha Five's a robot.

16:45.360 --> 16:45.920
Just do my-

16:45.920 --> 16:47.280
Hey, listen, here's the deal.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.320
If you want me to fight Rita Repulse,

16:50.320 --> 16:52.800
you gotta do my homework for me, Alpha Five, because I can't get it.

16:53.920 --> 16:56.080
These kids are gonna be so busy fighting crime,

16:56.080 --> 16:58.320
they're gonna go to college and they're gonna be like,

16:58.320 --> 17:00.240
so anyway, open your books.

17:00.240 --> 17:01.680
And they're like, I never learned to read.

17:02.240 --> 17:05.280
I was too busy punching a big, I don't know, octopus thing.

17:05.280 --> 17:09.520
Hey, Zordon, how do you ask a girl on a date?

17:09.520 --> 17:13.600
Ah, you just teleport her to your science station,

17:13.600 --> 17:15.360
and give her a big coin.

17:15.360 --> 17:17.760
I don't think that's okay.

17:17.760 --> 17:18.960
That doesn't seem right.

17:18.960 --> 17:22.720
Have you tried showing her your xenon crystals?

17:22.720 --> 17:23.280
No.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.880
No, I mean, I'm without consent.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.120
I didn't think she would like my xenon crystals.

17:29.680 --> 17:32.800
I think if I did get visited by an angel of Zordon's,

17:32.800 --> 17:36.480
and they offered me to be a grown-up Power Ranger,

17:36.480 --> 17:39.200
I would probably, and like they would give me a coin

17:39.200 --> 17:42.720
that let me transform into cool suits and get a dinosaur robot,

17:42.720 --> 17:44.400
I still think it's gonna be a no.

17:44.960 --> 17:51.040
Like as neat as that sounds, it also sounds like a great deal of work

17:51.040 --> 17:53.600
for what, as Justin pointed, or as Travis pointed out,

17:53.600 --> 17:55.520
one of you fucking guys pointed out,

17:55.520 --> 18:00.000
is an unpaid internship with a space alien.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.560
And if I'm being honest, I mean, I'm 36 years old,

18:04.560 --> 18:08.800
almost 37, I got two kids, but the truth is,

18:08.800 --> 18:11.200
being a Power Ranger is a level of responsibility

18:11.200 --> 18:12.560
I don't think I can handle,

18:12.560 --> 18:14.960
and I don't even mean like fighting the bad guys.

18:14.960 --> 18:18.160
I mean, those Zords look pretty difficult to pilot.

18:18.960 --> 18:20.960
I think I fucked that up pretty bad,

18:20.960 --> 18:23.840
and I don't think you can get insurance on those dang things.

18:23.840 --> 18:26.320
It's just that Rita's gonna keep sending her gooey guys.

18:26.320 --> 18:30.800
So like, it's easy for me to say no,

18:30.800 --> 18:32.320
I don't want this responsibility,

18:32.320 --> 18:36.480
and somebody braver with me with more free time would say yes,

18:36.480 --> 18:38.560
but I guess that makes me a bad person.

18:38.560 --> 18:38.880
Shit.

18:38.880 --> 18:39.200
No.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.960
The major thing would have made sense

18:40.960 --> 18:42.880
if he had only gotten homeschool kids.

18:43.520 --> 18:43.920
Okay.

18:43.920 --> 18:46.000
Go go Mighty Morphin homeschool kid Power Rangers.

18:46.000 --> 18:46.560
Now why is that?

18:46.560 --> 18:51.520
Then it's like they have incredible adult-shaped bodies,

18:52.400 --> 18:56.240
lithe, powerful, in the prime of their lives.

18:56.240 --> 18:56.400
Okay.

18:56.400 --> 19:00.000
But they also like don't have to be in school.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.760
They could just sort of tell their mom like,

19:01.760 --> 19:04.880
listen mom, I'm gonna go, I don't know,

19:04.880 --> 19:06.080
actualize or something.

19:06.080 --> 19:07.200
What do homeschool parents like to do?

19:07.200 --> 19:07.680
That's it.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:08.480 --> 19:08.960
That kind of thing.

19:08.960 --> 19:10.000
I'm gonna meditate.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.720
Hey, weren't the Big Bad Beetleborgs like literally 10?

19:13.280 --> 19:16.000
We actually, Travis, I got a letter.

19:16.560 --> 19:17.120
Oh no.

19:17.920 --> 19:21.840
Yeah, I got a letter from podcasts that we are,

19:21.840 --> 19:24.960
we as a podcast have talked about Big Bad Beetleborgs.

19:24.960 --> 19:26.640
The maximum number of times.

19:26.640 --> 19:28.720
We used up our Big Bad Beetle quota.

19:28.720 --> 19:30.000
Yeah, we did.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.040
It looks like in 2022 more slots are gonna open up, Travis.

19:33.040 --> 19:37.280
So like episode six, like 623 or so,

19:37.280 --> 19:39.120
if my math adds up, maybe we can.

19:39.120 --> 19:40.240
I'll save it.

19:40.240 --> 19:43.600
What we are doing is entering into sort of a cap and trade

19:43.600 --> 19:45.920
situation with 99% invisible,

19:45.920 --> 19:47.760
which to my knowledge has never talked about

19:47.760 --> 19:48.800
Big Bad Beetleborgs.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.080
That's the other 1%.

19:50.080 --> 19:51.680
That's the 1% right there.

19:51.680 --> 19:53.600
We're buying some of their credits

19:53.600 --> 19:59.120
and in exchange we have to plug the 99% invisible city,

19:59.120 --> 20:01.920
the new book from Roman Mars and 99% invisible.

20:01.920 --> 20:05.680
We have to plug that and then they are in exchange

20:06.880 --> 20:08.960
for talking about their fantastic book.

20:09.760 --> 20:12.800
We're gonna get a few credits to talk about Big Bad Beetleborgs.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.400
Okay, why was the house haunted?

20:14.400 --> 20:16.000
Doesn't that seem like a hat on a hat?

20:16.560 --> 20:19.440
Yeah, you're fighting things in your Big Bad Beetleborgs

20:19.440 --> 20:21.200
but also your house is like a haunted house.

20:21.200 --> 20:21.840
What the fuck?

20:21.840 --> 20:23.520
That's really how you're gonna, huh?

20:23.520 --> 20:24.480
Well, that's how I'm gonna use it.

20:24.480 --> 20:25.200
You guys can try it.

20:25.200 --> 20:25.840
Let me try this.

20:25.840 --> 20:26.400
Okay.

20:26.400 --> 20:29.120
Boy howdy, the genie character sure looks offensive

20:29.120 --> 20:32.400
but I can't put my finger on to which peoples.

20:32.400 --> 20:33.920
I think it's only to Jay Leno.

20:33.920 --> 20:35.760
It's offensive to Jay Leno's?

20:35.760 --> 20:39.520
Wow, he does sure look a hell of a lot like Joseph Leno.

20:40.720 --> 20:41.760
It's a good amount.

20:43.440 --> 20:47.920
Yeah, it's a good amount that a flabber looks like Joseph Leno.

20:47.920 --> 20:49.920
It does kind of look like someone said,

20:49.920 --> 20:53.280
hey, can you draw Joseph Leno from memory?

20:53.280 --> 20:55.360
And they said, yeah, I think so.

20:55.360 --> 20:56.160
I think so.

20:57.440 --> 21:02.080
Do you think the Power Rangers ever went to Zordon's secret cave

21:02.080 --> 21:03.680
when there wasn't stuff to do

21:03.680 --> 21:05.360
and they just wanted somebody to talk to?

21:05.360 --> 21:05.860
Yeah.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.480
I'm not really comfortable with this.

21:08.480 --> 21:10.560
This isn't like a social thing.

21:10.560 --> 21:14.000
This isn't, I have other things that I don't think you did.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.440
I have my own friends.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.440
I like to separate work and home.

21:17.440 --> 21:19.280
I'm binging justified.

21:19.280 --> 21:20.320
This isn't my thing.

21:20.320 --> 21:21.120
No spoilers.

21:21.120 --> 21:22.640
I'm only on season two.

21:23.520 --> 21:25.680
Now leave me in my giant bong.

21:26.880 --> 21:29.040
My parents have been fighting a lot lately.

21:29.040 --> 21:31.200
Oh gosh.

21:31.200 --> 21:32.240
Oh, what's that?

21:32.240 --> 21:35.280
Oh, Rita's attacking the aquarium.

21:35.280 --> 21:35.780
Oh no.

21:35.780 --> 21:39.120
Do you want another mammoth robot?

21:41.120 --> 21:43.600
Hold on, let me see what I got in the back.

21:44.400 --> 21:46.480
Okay, I'm going to send you to the moon.

21:46.480 --> 21:48.240
I'm going to send you to the moon?

21:48.240 --> 21:49.840
Is that anything?

21:49.840 --> 21:52.560
I got a plesiosaur robot back here.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.960
Will that help with your parents fighting?

21:55.760 --> 21:56.320
Probably.

21:56.320 --> 21:57.760
I don't think so, Zordon.

21:57.760 --> 22:00.080
I brought Tommy back from the dead.

22:00.080 --> 22:01.200
How does that make you feel?

22:03.920 --> 22:04.420
Okay.

22:05.200 --> 22:06.320
Here's another question.

22:06.320 --> 22:08.560
I was out on my lunch break running a few errands

22:08.560 --> 22:10.160
when I spotted a taco truck.

22:10.160 --> 22:11.520
It honestly sounded amazing.

22:11.520 --> 22:12.880
So I pulled over.

22:12.880 --> 22:14.240
Few problems though.

22:14.240 --> 22:17.360
Truck was parked in the parking lot of fire station

22:17.360 --> 22:19.280
and everyone in line had matching shirts.

22:20.800 --> 22:23.200
Was this taco truck only for the firefighters

22:23.200 --> 22:24.320
and everyone working there?

22:24.320 --> 22:26.080
How do I get in on this lunch?

22:26.080 --> 22:28.080
That's from Desperate for Tacos in Des Moines.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.040
This is, boys, this is a choice cut.

22:31.600 --> 22:35.760
This is a quandary that I feel like nobody

22:35.760 --> 22:37.840
has really tried to solve.

22:37.840 --> 22:40.000
So I feel like we have an opportunity right here

22:40.000 --> 22:44.320
to plant our flag in this fertile ground.

22:44.320 --> 22:46.560
Now I'm going to give the question asker

22:46.560 --> 22:48.080
the benefit of the doubt

22:48.080 --> 22:51.280
and say that if the food from said truck

22:51.280 --> 22:53.440
had been given away for free,

22:53.440 --> 22:55.680
that would have been mentioned in the question, right?

22:55.680 --> 22:58.480
So I'm going to assume that this wasn't like,

22:58.480 --> 23:02.080
oh, the chief paid for lunch for everybody or whatever.

23:02.080 --> 23:05.600
No, there's a food truck here

23:05.600 --> 23:07.040
and they're selling their food

23:07.040 --> 23:08.640
and you can come and get it.

23:08.640 --> 23:11.280
But this is clearly a function.

23:11.280 --> 23:13.520
This is clearly a firefighter function.

23:14.720 --> 23:17.600
But what's the harm in?

23:18.240 --> 23:19.520
Yeah, it's a business.

23:19.520 --> 23:20.560
It's a business.

23:21.360 --> 23:22.800
They do want to make money.

23:22.800 --> 23:24.240
Now here's where I would feel bad

23:24.240 --> 23:25.200
if we're being honest.

23:25.920 --> 23:27.760
I hopped last in line thinking like,

23:27.760 --> 23:28.720
well, I'll go last

23:28.720 --> 23:31.840
and then some other firefighters line up behind me

23:32.560 --> 23:34.640
and they're waiting behind me.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.160
Do I need to rotate back

23:36.160 --> 23:37.440
and stay in the back of the line?

23:37.440 --> 23:38.800
Cause I'm not a firefighter.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.040
I don't think so.

23:42.080 --> 23:43.600
Yeah, I don't think so.

23:43.600 --> 23:45.520
Or else you're not going to get your great,

23:46.240 --> 23:47.360
you know, kimchi fries

23:47.360 --> 23:48.640
or whatever it is that you're getting

23:48.640 --> 23:49.600
from this food truck.

23:51.360 --> 23:52.960
Honesty, I wouldn't.

23:53.760 --> 23:54.800
I wouldn't do it.

23:55.360 --> 23:56.080
Well, no.

23:56.080 --> 23:57.760
But I'm afraid of firefighters.

23:58.320 --> 23:58.820
Yeah.

24:00.640 --> 24:01.520
I wouldn't do it

24:01.520 --> 24:05.120
because I'm afraid of doing the wrong thing in public.

24:05.120 --> 24:05.620
Yeah.

24:05.620 --> 24:06.580
Yeah.

24:06.580 --> 24:09.380
So I would worry that I would get up there

24:09.380 --> 24:13.060
and someone somewhere on earth might think,

24:13.060 --> 24:14.180
well, he shouldn't do that.

24:14.820 --> 24:18.500
And then I would melt into the ground and die.

24:20.100 --> 24:21.540
And that's what I need to avoid.

24:21.540 --> 24:22.340
With a food truck,

24:22.340 --> 24:23.700
there's always the concern

24:23.700 --> 24:25.060
that you hand them the money

24:25.060 --> 24:27.620
and then they just drive away.

24:27.620 --> 24:28.180
Yeah.

24:28.180 --> 24:29.140
Fuck, that's happened to me

24:29.140 --> 24:30.580
so many times where I go,

24:30.580 --> 24:33.780
I'm like, oh, a nice gooey burger.

24:33.780 --> 24:34.420
I'll take one.

24:34.420 --> 24:35.700
Here's $15.

24:36.420 --> 24:37.300
Vroom, gone.

24:38.260 --> 24:39.700
It's like every time.

24:39.700 --> 24:40.500
Every time?

24:41.300 --> 24:42.820
Yeah, I'm starting to think about it, guys.

24:43.380 --> 24:45.300
I've never actually gotten food out of a truck.

24:45.300 --> 24:46.500
They always take my money

24:46.500 --> 24:47.140
and just drive right off.

24:47.140 --> 24:48.180
You know what, Griffin?

24:48.180 --> 24:49.460
Now that you mention it,

24:49.460 --> 24:51.940
there's not as many food trucks here in Cincinnati.

24:51.940 --> 24:52.660
Yeah.

24:52.660 --> 24:55.780
But yeah, every time.

24:56.820 --> 24:57.320
Huh.

25:00.180 --> 25:01.860
They've got a new one called Bite Me.

25:01.860 --> 25:02.660
It's a food truck

25:02.660 --> 25:04.420
with Asian street food type stuff.

25:04.420 --> 25:05.140
You got, wait,

25:05.140 --> 25:06.980
you got food trucks in Huntington?

25:06.980 --> 25:07.860
Well, sort of.

25:07.860 --> 25:08.660
It was in Barborsville.

25:08.660 --> 25:10.500
It was parked outside the Family Dollar

25:10.500 --> 25:12.900
that used to be a Rite Aid, you know?

25:12.900 --> 25:13.700
Glow Up.

25:17.380 --> 25:20.580
I drove up there, right?

25:21.620 --> 25:22.420
Because I wanted,

25:22.420 --> 25:24.420
I saw on Facebook they were there

25:24.420 --> 25:25.780
and they were moving around a lot.

25:25.780 --> 25:27.860
So I was like, I'd love to try this truck.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.060
So I get in the car

25:29.060 --> 25:30.740
and I drive up with my family.

25:30.740 --> 25:31.940
I put my family in the car.

25:31.940 --> 25:32.900
Okay.

25:32.900 --> 25:33.220
Okay.

25:33.220 --> 25:33.780
That's your first mistake.

25:33.780 --> 25:34.980
I drive up there.

25:34.980 --> 25:35.860
I get my mask.

25:35.860 --> 25:36.580
I think, well, you know,

25:36.580 --> 25:39.460
we haven't had any sort of dining experiences

25:40.900 --> 25:43.460
in terms of like sitting in a restaurant or anything

25:43.460 --> 25:44.820
and I'm not going to sit in this truck,

25:44.820 --> 25:46.500
but I feel like it's fairly safe for me

25:46.500 --> 25:48.100
to roll up there with my mask,

25:48.100 --> 25:50.340
get me some food, eat it in my car.

25:50.340 --> 25:51.700
So I drove up there

25:51.700 --> 25:52.740
and I go to the guy

25:53.540 --> 25:56.420
and I walk up to the truck

25:56.980 --> 25:58.580
and I'm kind of standing there

25:58.580 --> 25:59.780
and he's kind of looking at me

26:00.580 --> 26:01.780
and I'm kind of looking at him

26:01.780 --> 26:03.780
and he's got a Legend of Korra t-shirt on.

26:03.780 --> 26:04.580
That's not relevant.

26:04.580 --> 26:06.180
Just, I want to get a little color in there.

26:06.180 --> 26:06.900
Yeah.

26:06.900 --> 26:09.540
And I'm kind of standing there like a dummy

26:09.540 --> 26:11.060
and then eventually he's like,

26:11.060 --> 26:13.220
as if he doesn't know why I'm there.

26:13.220 --> 26:14.740
It just occurs to him

26:14.740 --> 26:15.860
and he's like, sorry,

26:15.860 --> 26:18.260
we are sold out of everything.

26:18.260 --> 26:18.760
Oh.

26:19.380 --> 26:21.780
And it's like, I am me.

26:22.500 --> 26:25.380
So I'm instantly mortified

26:25.380 --> 26:27.060
that I have bothered this person

26:27.060 --> 26:28.420
who no longer has food.

26:28.420 --> 26:31.780
So I start compulsively congratulating him

26:31.780 --> 26:34.340
on such a successful sales day.

26:34.340 --> 26:34.820
Normal.

26:34.820 --> 26:35.540
That's wonderful.

26:35.540 --> 26:38.660
I was just checking, you win.

26:39.940 --> 26:41.860
I just had to stop by and say,

26:41.860 --> 26:43.300
I heard that you did it

26:43.300 --> 26:45.620
and I just wanted to confirm you did it.

26:46.260 --> 26:47.540
He said, and then he said,

26:48.500 --> 26:50.100
we won't be here next week

26:50.820 --> 26:52.740
but we'll be here the week after that.

26:53.860 --> 26:55.940
Now, I want to say two things

26:55.940 --> 26:58.020
about this person's business strategy.

26:58.020 --> 27:00.020
One, they did not tell me

27:00.020 --> 27:01.220
where they would be next week.

27:02.180 --> 27:04.020
So there's other places I can go to.

27:04.020 --> 27:05.220
You saw my car.

27:05.220 --> 27:06.180
It's five feet away.

27:06.180 --> 27:06.820
Right.

27:06.820 --> 27:07.940
He would not reveal to me

27:07.940 --> 27:08.900
where he was going to be.

27:08.900 --> 27:09.940
So it might have been

27:09.940 --> 27:14.100
a secret firefighter only invitational

27:14.100 --> 27:16.100
is the one thing I want to say.

27:16.100 --> 27:17.540
The other thing I want to say is like,

27:19.220 --> 27:21.780
when you ran out of food in your food truck

27:22.500 --> 27:23.380
and you've told people

27:23.380 --> 27:24.580
where your food truck is,

27:24.580 --> 27:27.460
shouldn't you, at that point,

27:28.260 --> 27:33.220
drive away to a different location?

27:33.220 --> 27:34.580
Your restaurant is empty.

27:34.580 --> 27:36.180
It's no longer a restaurant.

27:36.180 --> 27:37.780
Now it's just a truck

27:37.780 --> 27:40.020
with a picture of a walk on the outside.

27:40.020 --> 27:41.460
Please drive away.

27:41.460 --> 27:43.860
Please don't make me walk up to your empty truck.

27:43.860 --> 27:45.460
That would be like me walking up to,

27:45.460 --> 27:47.060
at that point, I'm walking up to any truck

27:47.620 --> 27:48.420
and just expecting to be served.

27:48.420 --> 27:49.220
You got food?

27:50.100 --> 27:51.220
Hey, you got food?

27:51.220 --> 27:52.100
Well, and here, Justin,

27:52.100 --> 27:57.220
if I might suggest a food truck saves you.

27:57.220 --> 27:59.140
Like if you're in a restaurant, right?

27:59.140 --> 28:01.140
You have to wait for food supplies

28:01.140 --> 28:02.340
to be delivered to you.

28:02.900 --> 28:05.780
If you run out of food in your food truck,

28:05.780 --> 28:08.660
might suggest driving to the store.

28:08.660 --> 28:08.980
Yeah.

28:08.980 --> 28:10.580
Just go get some more food

28:10.580 --> 28:13.380
and then come back and keep making more money.

28:13.940 --> 28:16.740
Do you think one of the toughest parts

28:16.740 --> 28:18.340
of owning a food truck is investing

28:18.340 --> 28:21.380
in a really good hiding place for your food truck?

28:21.380 --> 28:24.260
Because you can't, you can't be able to,

28:25.780 --> 28:27.700
people shouldn't be able to see it

28:28.660 --> 28:31.940
if it's not, if you aren't slinging bergs.

28:31.940 --> 28:35.140
So like you need, it's a truck, so it's big.

28:35.140 --> 28:36.740
So like getting garage space for it

28:36.740 --> 28:37.940
must be pretty tough.

28:38.500 --> 28:40.100
You think it's just like a big tarp

28:40.100 --> 28:41.380
that they throw over them?

28:41.380 --> 28:42.660
I'll tell you what I do, Griffin.

28:42.660 --> 28:42.980
Yeah.

28:43.540 --> 28:44.500
Palm fronds.

28:45.140 --> 28:46.740
Palm fronds.

28:46.740 --> 28:47.700
Yep, yep.

28:47.700 --> 28:49.620
That way, anyone comes by my house,

28:49.620 --> 28:52.980
front of my house is just a big pile of palm fronds.

28:52.980 --> 28:56.820
Nothing to see here, just some palm fronds.

28:56.820 --> 29:00.500
That Korean barbecue truck is covered in palm fronds.

29:00.500 --> 29:04.180
I'm not following the aesthetic, the theme.

29:04.180 --> 29:08.180
Justin, I want you to know, it really bothers me.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.660
And I want to admit, I can't quite put a finger on it.

29:10.660 --> 29:12.660
I don't know that you did anything wrong,

29:12.660 --> 29:14.340
but something about getting in a car

29:14.340 --> 29:17.700
to drive to a food truck is weird to me.

29:17.700 --> 29:18.100
Yeah.

29:18.100 --> 29:20.100
Because I was under the impression

29:20.100 --> 29:21.780
that the business model was such

29:21.780 --> 29:23.220
that the reverse was true.

29:23.780 --> 29:25.940
But if a food truck parks somewhere

29:25.940 --> 29:28.020
and then says, you have to come to me,

29:28.980 --> 29:33.140
I feel like maybe something has gone wrong.

29:33.700 --> 29:35.380
I mean, you're not wrong.

29:35.380 --> 29:36.980
But then if that's the case,

29:38.260 --> 29:39.540
they've limited their audience

29:39.540 --> 29:42.020
to a Venn diagram of family dollar employees

29:42.020 --> 29:44.180
that would love a bon me on the go.

29:44.180 --> 29:44.900
Yeah.

29:44.900 --> 29:47.460
Which I'm not saying is zero,

29:47.460 --> 29:49.220
but is that a sustainable business?

29:49.220 --> 29:50.020
I don't know.

29:50.020 --> 29:52.180
Well, then what about driving around,

29:52.180 --> 29:54.020
maybe play some music from the top

29:54.020 --> 29:55.460
to let people know you're coming.

29:56.020 --> 29:56.500
Now we're talking.

29:56.500 --> 29:58.100
And you just run out of your front door

29:58.100 --> 29:58.900
and get a bon me.

29:59.460 --> 30:00.820
Do you want bon mes?

30:00.820 --> 30:02.100
They're so crunchy, crunchy, green.

30:03.300 --> 30:03.860
Now go on.

30:04.580 --> 30:06.100
I don't know that I can do this again.

30:06.740 --> 30:09.380
We have pork flavor and have tofu queen.

30:11.940 --> 30:13.220
Okay, was there a comment here?

30:13.220 --> 30:14.260
Important question.

30:14.260 --> 30:14.500
Yeah.

30:15.220 --> 30:16.820
We got tofu queen.

30:16.820 --> 30:18.500
That was a sort of interjection.

30:19.620 --> 30:21.380
An interjectory queen.

30:21.380 --> 30:22.980
I'm tired of giving away free money

30:22.980 --> 30:24.980
to other businesses that don't deserve it.

30:24.980 --> 30:27.380
I want to make some money for our business.

30:27.380 --> 30:28.340
That deserves it.

30:28.900 --> 30:29.860
That deserves it.

30:30.900 --> 30:34.020
Because we're promising young people.

30:34.020 --> 30:34.900
And we're doing our best.

30:34.900 --> 30:35.780
And we don't have a truck.

30:35.780 --> 30:36.980
Listen, if I could drive around

30:36.980 --> 30:38.740
in a truck and podcast, I would.

30:38.740 --> 30:40.980
I mean, fucking Alex Jones seems to have figured it out.

30:40.980 --> 30:50.580
Let's go to the money's up.

30:55.380 --> 30:58.180
Squarespace, deal with it.

30:58.740 --> 30:59.380
Oh, shit.

31:00.020 --> 31:02.740
Yeah, I'm sick and tired of being nice.

31:02.740 --> 31:04.500
And it's time to get real.

31:04.500 --> 31:05.780
You want a website.

31:05.780 --> 31:07.060
You don't have a website.

31:07.060 --> 31:09.140
You don't even know how to make a website.

31:09.140 --> 31:11.060
Squarespace knows how to make websites

31:11.060 --> 31:12.820
and they will help you make one.

31:12.820 --> 31:14.500
You could showcase your work,

31:14.500 --> 31:16.180
sell products and services of all kinds,

31:16.180 --> 31:18.260
and promote your physical online business.

31:18.260 --> 31:19.460
It's 2020.

31:19.460 --> 31:21.780
How many times do I have to tell you about Squarespace

31:21.780 --> 31:24.020
before you get off your duff

31:24.020 --> 31:26.980
and then put your duff down in front of a computer

31:26.980 --> 31:28.500
and go to Squarespace

31:28.500 --> 31:31.060
while your duff rests comfortably in a chair?

31:32.100 --> 31:34.580
That way you can get to Squarespace's

31:34.580 --> 31:36.180
beautiful customizable templates

31:36.180 --> 31:38.020
created by world-class designers.

31:38.020 --> 31:40.420
Everything optimized for mobile right out of the box,

31:40.420 --> 31:42.580
analytics to help you grow in real time,

31:42.580 --> 31:43.780
free and secure hosting,

31:43.780 --> 31:45.700
and nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

31:45.700 --> 31:47.940
And then once you've built your website,

31:47.940 --> 31:49.220
pick your duff back up,

31:49.780 --> 31:51.540
move it back over to where it was,

31:51.540 --> 31:52.580
maybe the couch?

31:52.580 --> 31:53.620
I don't know.

31:53.620 --> 31:56.900
And then sit and wait for a new season

31:56.900 --> 31:58.500
of your favorite TV show.

31:58.500 --> 32:00.580
I'm gonna say Mindhunter.

32:00.580 --> 32:01.140
I don't know.

32:01.700 --> 32:05.300
Go to squarespace.com slash my brother for a free trial.

32:05.300 --> 32:06.500
And when you're ready to launch,

32:06.500 --> 32:08.580
use the offer code mybrother to save 10%

32:08.580 --> 32:10.900
of your first purchase of a website or domain.

32:10.900 --> 32:12.260
Then go on Twitter

32:12.260 --> 32:14.340
and let's talk about the new season of Mindhunter.

32:16.660 --> 32:18.660
Travis is really lonely out here.

32:20.980 --> 32:23.940
I don't even know if there is a new season of Mindhunter.

32:23.940 --> 32:25.540
I don't know when it's coming out.

32:25.540 --> 32:26.100
I could have said-

32:26.100 --> 32:28.500
I don't even know what Mindhunter is a hundred percent.

32:28.500 --> 32:29.540
I know!

32:29.540 --> 32:31.300
Groff's in it, I think.

32:31.300 --> 32:32.340
I think the Groff's in it.

32:32.340 --> 32:34.660
And I could have said Supernatural

32:34.660 --> 32:36.420
and instead I said Mindhunter.

32:36.420 --> 32:37.700
Dude, I'm kicking myself.

32:37.700 --> 32:42.180
I do appreciate adding a little spice travel variety

32:42.180 --> 32:46.260
to what is typically a sort of supernatural stew

32:46.260 --> 32:48.660
that you cook up week in, week out on this podcast.

32:50.100 --> 32:52.660
Quip also is sponsoring this episode

32:52.660 --> 32:54.260
and they have electric toothbrushes.

32:54.260 --> 32:55.140
Hell yeah.

32:55.140 --> 32:56.100
Yeah, fuck yeah.

32:57.460 --> 33:00.020
I feel like we're coming at the listeners

33:00.020 --> 33:02.340
pretty hot and heavy in this ad break.

33:02.340 --> 33:02.740
You know what?

33:04.100 --> 33:06.340
Sometimes they need a fire under their doves, Griffin.

33:06.340 --> 33:07.700
Talk about the doves a lot.

33:07.700 --> 33:09.300
Show me your fucking teeth.

33:09.860 --> 33:10.420
Whoa.

33:10.420 --> 33:12.900
Show me those fucking hobgoblin teeth.

33:13.460 --> 33:14.980
Okay, now you're getting mean.

33:15.540 --> 33:16.500
Pop out your grill.

33:16.500 --> 33:17.620
Let's see them.

33:17.620 --> 33:18.120
Ew!

33:18.980 --> 33:19.700
No, Griffin-

33:19.700 --> 33:22.020
You need to clean those.

33:22.020 --> 33:23.620
No, you're trying to energize, Griffin.

33:23.620 --> 33:25.460
Not like insult.

33:25.460 --> 33:26.420
Oh, let me try.

33:26.420 --> 33:28.100
Let me see your fucking teeth.

33:28.100 --> 33:28.740
Whoa.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.980
All right, all right, all right.

33:32.740 --> 33:34.500
Well, you need to maintain those

33:34.500 --> 33:37.300
using equip a smart electric toothbrush

33:37.300 --> 33:41.220
because they've gamified oral hygiene

33:41.220 --> 33:42.980
in a really fun way

33:42.980 --> 33:45.700
because they've got a new smart electric toothbrush

33:45.700 --> 33:48.100
that can get you great perks

33:48.100 --> 33:49.940
as you form good brushing habits.

33:49.940 --> 33:53.060
Things like free products, gift cards, and more.

33:53.060 --> 33:54.580
And there's a smart brush.

33:54.580 --> 33:56.660
It's for adults and kids

33:56.660 --> 33:59.780
that connects to the Quip app via Bluetooth

33:59.780 --> 34:01.300
and it tracks how well you brush

34:01.300 --> 34:01.780
and you can get tips on-

34:01.780 --> 34:02.980
More like white tooth.

34:02.980 --> 34:04.020
Sorry?

34:04.020 --> 34:05.780
More like white tooth.

34:05.780 --> 34:06.340
Say again?

34:06.340 --> 34:07.620
More like white tooth.

34:07.620 --> 34:08.420
Because it'll turn-

34:08.420 --> 34:09.460
Because yeah, sure.

34:09.460 --> 34:10.740
Yeah, absolutely, Trav.

34:10.740 --> 34:11.220
Thank you.

34:13.460 --> 34:14.260
You get it.

34:14.260 --> 34:16.580

34:16.580 --> 34:17.460
and then it'll give you things

like free products and gift cards

34:18.820 --> 34:21.460
and discounts from Quip and their partners.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.460
And yeah, if you already have a Quip

I'm very excited.

34:55.540 --> 34:57.780
Yeah, my dentist is gonna be fucking psyched.

34:57.780 --> 35:01.860
Video games, video games, video games.

35:01.860 --> 35:02.500
You like them?

35:02.500 --> 35:04.260
Maybe you wish you had more time for them.

35:04.260 --> 35:05.940
Maybe you want to know the best ones to play.

35:05.940 --> 35:08.660
Maybe you want to know what happens to Mario when he dies.

35:08.660 --> 35:10.900
In that case, you should check out TripleClick.

35:10.900 --> 35:13.380
It's a podcast about video games.

35:13.380 --> 35:15.140
A podcast about video games?

35:15.140 --> 35:16.500
But I don't have time for that.

35:16.500 --> 35:17.460
Sure you do.

35:17.460 --> 35:19.540

35:24.420 --> 35:25.860
about how video games work.

35:25.860 --> 35:28.260
To fascinating and sometimes weird stories

35:28.260 --> 35:29.780
about the games we love.

35:29.780 --> 35:32.100
TripleClick is hosted by me, Kirk Hamilton.

35:39.380 --> 35:39.880
Bye.

35:39.880 --> 35:55.020
I want to munch.

35:55.020 --> 35:55.760
Squad.

35:55.760 --> 35:57.340
I want to munch.

35:57.340 --> 35:57.840
Squad.

35:57.840 --> 35:58.340
Do host.

35:58.340 --> 35:58.840
Munch.

35:58.840 --> 35:59.340
Munch host.

35:59.340 --> 35:59.840
Do host.

35:59.840 --> 36:00.340
We scuffle.

36:00.340 --> 36:00.840
Munch.

36:00.840 --> 36:02.380
The Welcome Munch Squad.

36:02.380 --> 36:03.380
It's a radio show.

36:03.380 --> 36:03.880
A radio show.

36:03.880 --> 36:05.180
And it's a radio show.

36:05.180 --> 36:06.420
And it's a radio show.

36:06.420 --> 36:07.900
And it's a radio show.

36:07.900 --> 36:12.900
The Welcome Munch Squad, it's a podcast within a podcast,

36:13.660 --> 36:17.700
profiling the latest and greatest in brand eating.

36:17.700 --> 36:19.540
Sunset, it's sunset years.

36:19.540 --> 36:20.980
Yeah, sunsetting, I believe.

36:20.980 --> 36:23.540
Yeah, it's in the twilight years of this bit

36:23.540 --> 36:26.420
until I come up with a better bit,

36:26.420 --> 36:28.260
which you wouldn't think would be that hard,

36:28.260 --> 36:29.740
but here we are.

36:31.180 --> 36:36.180
KFC is gonna introduce new signature dipping sauce

36:36.180 --> 36:39.740
nationwide on October 12th.

36:39.740 --> 36:41.900
And as the crow flies, my friend,

36:41.900 --> 36:44.880
that is possibly the day you're listening to this.

36:44.880 --> 36:46.620
Kentucky Fried Chicken announced Thursday

36:46.620 --> 36:51.260
that it is launching a new signature dipping sauce

36:51.260 --> 36:54.260
that's sure to make fried chicken fans rejoice.

36:54.260 --> 36:57.700
Introducing KFC sauce.

36:57.700 --> 37:01.780
That's a signature sauce that's tangy and sweet

37:01.780 --> 37:05.180
with a bit of smokiness specifically designed

37:05.180 --> 37:06.540
to pair with crispy tenders.

37:06.540 --> 37:09.900
It kind of seems like they threw a lot of flavor words

37:09.900 --> 37:10.980
in there, huh?

37:10.980 --> 37:11.820
That's great.

37:11.820 --> 37:16.040
You get umami, umami and umami mixed up in there, I like it.

37:17.260 --> 37:20.180
When we set out to create a new signature sauce,

37:20.180 --> 37:24.460
we went right to the experts, our customers, to find out.

37:24.460 --> 37:26.980
Now hold on, I've eaten at KFC

37:26.980 --> 37:29.980
and I'll tell you right now, I am not.

37:29.980 --> 37:31.460
You're a fucking tourist.

37:31.460 --> 37:33.500
Don't call yourself a KFC customer.

37:33.500 --> 37:36.300
Well, there was a time in my younger years.

37:36.300 --> 37:38.460
Oh boy, oh boy.

37:38.460 --> 37:40.020
We went to our customers to find out

37:40.020 --> 37:43.260
what made a sauce best in class for dipping.

37:43.260 --> 37:45.020
It needs to be viscous.

37:45.020 --> 37:46.420
Yeah, it can't be so wet

37:46.420 --> 37:48.780
that it just runs right off the tender.

37:48.780 --> 37:50.520
But also not too solid.

37:50.520 --> 37:52.700
I wanna be able to put the tender in.

37:52.700 --> 37:57.500
The tender has to be able to enter the spicy liquid.

37:57.500 --> 37:59.980
It is weird to think that dipping,

37:59.980 --> 38:03.060
the physical act of dipping was the primary concern,

38:03.060 --> 38:04.420
not the eating that would follow.

38:04.420 --> 38:06.260
No, no, no, that's secondary.

38:06.260 --> 38:08.220
If you get that primary thing wrong

38:08.220 --> 38:11.020
and you either can't get the tender in there

38:11.020 --> 38:12.940
or the tender don't pick nothing up,

38:12.940 --> 38:14.020
well, after that, friend,

38:14.020 --> 38:16.020
what it tastes like don't mean nothing.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.740
That's from Andrea Zachiminsky,

38:19.740 --> 38:22.380
the chief marketing officer of KFC US.

38:22.380 --> 38:23.220
You know what?

38:23.220 --> 38:25.340
A lot of times they put the chief marketing officer

38:25.340 --> 38:27.540
in these things and I kind of find that frustrating

38:27.540 --> 38:30.560
because their whole job is to sell stuff,

38:30.560 --> 38:32.100
so how can I know I can trust them?

38:32.100 --> 38:33.300
Yeah, right.

38:33.300 --> 38:35.260
Give me the head of R&D.

38:36.100 --> 38:38.660
Yeah, I want an impartial person

38:38.660 --> 38:41.620
that doesn't care if I eat it or not to bring me my news.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.940
You know, just trying to get me to eat it.

38:43.940 --> 38:46.480
I wanna know what flavors they tried to put in the sauce

38:46.480 --> 38:48.400
but couldn't quite make it work.

38:48.400 --> 38:50.060
I wanna know their shortcomings.

38:50.060 --> 38:53.220
Well, our first idea was chicken flavored sauce.

38:53.220 --> 38:55.040
We figured let's enhance it,

38:55.040 --> 38:56.740
so we just ground up a bunch of chicken.

38:56.740 --> 38:58.540
It's just like eating the chicken you know,

38:58.540 --> 38:59.780
it's that much wetter.

38:59.780 --> 39:02.380
But then the problem was people just slurped the sauce

39:02.380 --> 39:04.320
and they left the salad chicken alone

39:04.320 --> 39:07.460
and we said this is too dangerous for any one man to have.

39:09.460 --> 39:13.980
They came in and said they don't want the chicken anymore.

39:13.980 --> 39:15.220
They just want the sauce.

39:15.220 --> 39:16.300
It was too powerful.

39:16.300 --> 39:19.820
We buried it in a bunker underneath our HQ

39:19.820 --> 39:23.020
where it shall remain and be studied by top men.

39:23.020 --> 39:26.300
Until Rick and Morty does a fucking hysterical

39:26.300 --> 39:28.340
chicken sauce episode.

39:28.340 --> 39:31.740
Andrea continued, we went through 50 iterations

39:31.740 --> 39:34.420
and the response to this recipe was overwhelming.

39:34.420 --> 39:36.220
I'm assuming that response was

39:36.220 --> 39:39.120
please stop making me eat this fucking sauce.

39:39.120 --> 39:40.980
Just let me see my family.

39:40.980 --> 39:43.460
Let me sleep for fuck's sake.

39:43.460 --> 39:46.080
It's been 10 days.

39:46.080 --> 39:49.900
Beginning October 12th in all KFC US restaurants.

39:49.900 --> 39:52.580
What a logistical effort this is.

39:52.580 --> 39:57.460
Fried chicken dipping fans, which apparently exists,

39:57.460 --> 40:00.500
can enjoy the new signature KFC sauce

40:00.500 --> 40:04.180
along with a newly revamped core sauce lineup

40:04.180 --> 40:08.200
of classic ranch, honey BBQ, and honey mustard

40:08.200 --> 40:10.220
in addition to KFC hot sauce.

40:10.220 --> 40:11.060
Oh, thank God.

40:11.060 --> 40:13.140
I was afraid you weren't gonna say the hot sauce, you know?

40:13.140 --> 40:14.440
Yeah.

40:14.440 --> 40:18.620
Those who love dipping do indeed take sauces seriously.

40:18.620 --> 40:22.960
Some going so far as to deem chicken an edible spoon

40:22.960 --> 40:25.620
for sauce or a vessel for flavor.

40:25.620 --> 40:27.980
That's a fucking sentence from this rest release.

40:27.980 --> 40:29.100
I kid you not.

40:29.100 --> 40:31.440
Hey, why did you guys stop hanging out with Derek?

40:31.440 --> 40:33.820
Oh, you'll never believe the bullshit he said.

40:33.820 --> 40:36.140
I know you know Derek says a lot of bullshit,

40:36.140 --> 40:37.740
but the other day we were eating fried chicken

40:37.740 --> 40:40.100
and he said yum yum edible spoon vessel flavor

40:40.100 --> 40:42.540
flavor vessel and I had to get the fuck out of there

40:42.540 --> 40:44.540
as fast as I could and get the kids out.

40:44.540 --> 40:46.620
I left Jean there.

40:46.620 --> 40:47.780
I haven't seen her since.

40:47.780 --> 40:50.140
I don't know what happened to her.

40:50.140 --> 40:51.540
I miss my wife.

40:51.540 --> 40:52.940
I'm so scared.

40:52.940 --> 40:56.860
For many, forgetting the sauce is a meal ruiner.

40:56.860 --> 41:00.580
In a recent survey from DoorDash, 75% of Americans

41:00.580 --> 41:03.940
say their meal is ruined if the sauces are forgotten.

41:03.940 --> 41:05.180
Oh boy.

41:05.180 --> 41:09.420
And 20% say sauce is the single most important part

41:09.420 --> 41:11.260
of a great fried chicken meal.

41:11.260 --> 41:14.660
Okay, sometimes I just get a bag of sauce.

41:14.660 --> 41:16.940
Can you imagine being put into a position

41:16.940 --> 41:20.300
where you, a human being on the Earth,

41:20.300 --> 41:23.160
has to try to come up with an opinion about

41:23.160 --> 41:26.040
the most important part of a great fried chicken meal?

41:28.260 --> 41:29.900
Yeah, it's the chicken.

41:29.900 --> 41:30.740
Everybody's the chicken.

41:30.740 --> 41:34.220
The flavor of the chicken and how good it tastes to eat it.

41:34.220 --> 41:36.160
Let me, okay, listen.

41:36.160 --> 41:37.560
I like dipping.

41:38.940 --> 41:43.060
I don't know who the profile of this person is.

41:43.060 --> 41:44.860
I don't know who this person is who's like,

41:44.860 --> 41:46.420
oh, why do I get a fried chicken?

41:46.420 --> 41:47.860
Thank you so much for asking.

41:47.860 --> 41:50.420
I like to put it into things.

41:50.420 --> 41:53.060
Yeah, I like how it's a spoon you can eat

41:53.060 --> 41:54.380
and I'm a dirt bag.

41:54.380 --> 41:56.940
Luckily for those who love dipping,

41:56.940 --> 42:00.220
KFC's extra crispy TM tenders

42:00.220 --> 42:03.040
are perfectly designed for dipping

42:03.040 --> 42:06.540
in the sense that they're edible and physical.

42:06.540 --> 42:07.660
They're perfectly designed for dipping

42:07.660 --> 42:10.260
and elevate the overall sauce experience.

42:10.260 --> 42:14.380
The hills and valleys created by KFC's extra crispy breading

42:14.380 --> 42:17.260
form little lakes of sauce on every tender,

42:17.260 --> 42:19.780
making the final bite crispy, crunchy,

42:19.780 --> 42:20.780
and bursting with flavor.

42:20.780 --> 42:22.060
And you know, if you're eating KFC,

42:22.060 --> 42:25.140
it may very well be the final bite, period.

42:25.140 --> 42:25.980
So who knows?

42:25.980 --> 42:29.820
The wild topography of these crunchy boys.

42:29.820 --> 42:30.660
What's that?

42:30.660 --> 42:34.140
Oh, it's a hidden cavern full of delicious sauce.

42:34.140 --> 42:36.500
Oh, and a dragon's gold.

42:36.500 --> 42:38.700
I'm Sir David Attenborough.

42:38.700 --> 42:41.660
Observe the gazelle as it gallops

42:41.660 --> 42:45.700
through the different nooks and crannies to celebrate.

42:45.700 --> 42:50.180
This is, it is amazing at this point of this press release

42:50.180 --> 42:53.740
and I'm not even to the part that I was really excited about.

42:53.740 --> 42:58.260
To celebrate its new signature KFC sauce,

42:58.260 --> 43:00.780
KFC's head chef, Chris Scott,

43:00.780 --> 43:05.780
created three KFC charcuterie recipes.

43:06.980 --> 43:07.820
Oh boy.

43:07.820 --> 43:09.340
Yes, I was waiting for it.

43:09.340 --> 43:11.620
So far I was like, this is informative and interesting,

43:11.620 --> 43:13.960
but not that wild.

43:13.960 --> 43:15.400
Where's the actionable part?

43:15.400 --> 43:17.700
Where's the part that I can do at home?

43:17.700 --> 43:20.420
Well, good news from chef Chris Scott.

43:21.740 --> 43:24.460
Who under duress developed these recipes.

43:24.460 --> 43:29.460
Yeah, he has as terms of his resignation

43:29.500 --> 43:32.020
created as his final act.

43:32.020 --> 43:35.340
Who upon the KFC submitting his charcuterie recipes

43:35.340 --> 43:39.540
was handed a vial of the anti-toxin for his family.

43:39.540 --> 43:42.720
He printed it on the back of his resignation letter.

43:42.720 --> 43:46.640
They're KFC charcuterie, it doesn't trip off the top,

43:46.640 --> 43:47.500
but you get the idea, right?

43:47.500 --> 43:50.040
KFC charcuterie.

43:50.040 --> 43:52.000
Bored recipes, you can try it at home.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.120
Charcuterie doesn't have to be all cold cuts,

43:56.120 --> 43:57.440
cheeses and crackers.

43:57.440 --> 43:58.280
Sure.

43:58.280 --> 43:59.960
It can also be delicious comfort foods

43:59.960 --> 44:01.800
like extra crispy tenders,

44:01.800 --> 44:04.040
secret recipe fries and indulgent sauces.

44:04.040 --> 44:06.200
That's just a meal.

44:06.200 --> 44:09.680
That's one of Colonel Sanders' standard meals.

44:09.680 --> 44:12.160
You know, charcuterie doesn't have to be meat and cheese.

44:12.160 --> 44:14.320
Sometimes you can just be a bowl of oatmeal.

44:15.640 --> 44:18.300
Sometimes you can be a child's laughter.

44:19.240 --> 44:22.680
Or just some loose grass you picked up from the ground

44:22.680 --> 44:24.960
and sprinkled on someone's car.

44:24.960 --> 44:27.560
Charcuterie doesn't have to be all cold cuts.

44:27.560 --> 44:30.000
It can be watching half of episode two

44:30.000 --> 44:32.080
in your hotel room while you're drunk.

44:32.080 --> 44:32.920
It can be anything.

44:32.920 --> 44:34.800
It can be a fucking Toyota Yaris.

44:34.800 --> 44:35.920
Get out of here.

44:37.200 --> 44:40.120
They are both fun to create and to eat.

44:40.120 --> 44:43.520
And I know around my house, we are definitely in need

44:43.520 --> 44:45.540
of some creative ways to break up the monotony

44:45.540 --> 44:46.380
of meals at home.

44:46.380 --> 44:47.220
Oh boy.

44:47.220 --> 44:48.040
Okay.

44:48.040 --> 44:48.880
Oh, my fucking kids.

44:48.880 --> 44:49.720
So we're baking KFC charcuterie.

44:49.720 --> 44:52.440
Oh, my fucking kids.

44:52.440 --> 44:53.760
Oh, my partner.

44:53.760 --> 44:55.760
Oh, it's so fucking boring.

44:55.760 --> 44:56.600
Please, KFC.

44:57.720 --> 45:00.500
The process and assembly of a charcuterie board

45:00.500 --> 45:02.600
have become a creative outlet for many

45:02.600 --> 45:05.560
and has recently become a social media phenomenon.

45:05.560 --> 45:09.560
On TikTok, videos associated with the hashtag

45:09.560 --> 45:11.800
hashtag charcuterie have been viewed

45:11.800 --> 45:16.800
more than 224.8 million times.

45:17.160 --> 45:19.400
And many popular charcuterie creators

45:19.400 --> 45:21.240
have gained notoriety for their elaborate

45:21.240 --> 45:22.480
and mouthwatering creations.

45:22.480 --> 45:25.140
You know what I'm going on TikTok right now?

45:25.140 --> 45:27.080
If you see, Trav, Trav, Trav.

45:27.080 --> 45:29.320
If you see anyone doing a funny Fortnite dance on there,

45:29.320 --> 45:30.560
you make sure to let me know.

45:30.560 --> 45:33.900
I'm not seeing any KFC yet.

45:34.800 --> 45:37.000
Okay, let me just scroll down.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.680
Oh, Fortnite dance.

45:38.680 --> 45:40.600
Yeah, which one?

45:40.600 --> 45:42.960
I'll tell you, what I did see before I saw KFC

45:42.960 --> 45:45.160
was somebody making a McDonald's charcuterie board

45:45.160 --> 45:46.720
and it looks like they figured that one out

45:46.720 --> 45:48.560
all on their own without any recipes.

45:48.560 --> 45:50.680
They didn't need a press release or anything.

45:50.680 --> 45:54.200
Huh, here's a Chick-fil-A charcuterie board.

45:54.200 --> 45:55.560
Oh, no.

45:55.560 --> 45:56.960
What's on that?

45:56.960 --> 45:58.140
Chick-fil-A food.

45:58.140 --> 46:00.720
And a little New Testament.

46:00.720 --> 46:02.240
I wish it was easier to keep track

46:02.240 --> 46:03.960
of whether or not it was permissible

46:03.960 --> 46:05.440
to eat Chick-fil-A at any given moment.

46:05.440 --> 46:07.120
Just go ahead and assume no.

46:07.120 --> 46:10.160
Yeah, that's a safe assumption, isn't it?

46:10.160 --> 46:14.800
One easy way to remember how to find this podcast

46:14.800 --> 46:19.800
is just go to kfcrcuterie.com and you're going to find

46:19.920 --> 46:24.840
that I fucking snagged it from them.

46:24.840 --> 46:25.680
No, you know what?

46:25.680 --> 46:27.360
I'm gonna make it redirect to Bojangles.

46:27.360 --> 46:31.000
I just decided that instead. Oh my God, Justin.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.080
I'm gonna do that, or Zaxby's.

46:33.080 --> 46:34.080
No, you know what?

46:34.080 --> 46:36.240
Zaxby's. Okay.

46:36.240 --> 46:38.400
That's what I'm gonna do.

46:38.400 --> 46:41.400
Let's see, the charcuteries are the KFC Little Dipper,

46:41.400 --> 46:45.880
a snackable combination of KFC Extra Crispy Chicken Tenders,

46:45.880 --> 46:46.960
secret recipe fries

46:46.960 --> 46:48.760
paired with your favorite dipping sauces.

46:48.760 --> 46:50.840
So that's just- A meal.

46:50.840 --> 46:51.680
A meal. A meal.

46:51.680 --> 46:54.180
From KFC. And with a Sprite on the side.

46:54.180 --> 46:59.180
So there's also the Kentucky Game Night Trio.

47:02.240 --> 47:05.020
That's Kentucky Fried Buffalo Wings,

47:05.020 --> 47:08.160
KFC Extra Crispy Tenders, and secret recipe fries

47:08.160 --> 47:11.600
complemented by KFC sauce and grocery items

47:11.600 --> 47:13.920
like blue cheese, fresh celery, and more.

47:17.920 --> 47:21.120
It's an admission that with a little bit of work

47:21.120 --> 47:23.280
and some products from your local grocery store,

47:23.280 --> 47:25.640
you could make this palatable.

47:25.640 --> 47:28.360
Listen, we've talked a lot of shit about KFC,

47:28.360 --> 47:31.160
but KFC, if you want to partner with me

47:31.160 --> 47:33.200
for like a Travis McElroy meal,

47:33.200 --> 47:35.500
like Travis McElroy, he's pretty cool.

47:35.500 --> 47:37.320
And we're gonna make a meal that is,

47:37.320 --> 47:40.040
this is what Travis McElroy eats when he comes to KFC.

47:40.040 --> 47:41.380
I will happily do that.

47:41.380 --> 47:43.560
I will do that. Please, this isn't-

47:43.560 --> 47:45.960
You have not had the legwork on Yum Brands, Travis.

47:45.960 --> 47:47.880
I don't know how to tell you this,

47:47.880 --> 47:49.420
but you have not done the kind of research

47:49.420 --> 47:50.920
into Yum Brands that you would need to.

47:50.920 --> 47:52.680
Oh, are you saying you have?

47:52.680 --> 47:53.760
To commit to something like that.

47:53.760 --> 47:56.100
Oh, are they- Wait, Justin.

47:56.100 --> 47:56.940
Are they shitheads?

47:56.940 --> 47:57.780
Everybody is.

47:57.780 --> 47:58.740
Oh, man.

47:58.740 --> 47:59.580
Twist.

47:59.580 --> 48:00.800
Ugh.

48:00.800 --> 48:04.400
So that's the scoop on the KFC charcuterie.

48:04.400 --> 48:05.480
You can make that at home.

48:05.480 --> 48:06.440
I guess what they're saying,

48:06.440 --> 48:07.920
what they're really saying with this,

48:07.920 --> 48:09.720
if I could just be so bold,

48:09.720 --> 48:12.520
what they're really saying with this is put it on a plate.

48:12.520 --> 48:13.360
Yeah. Put it on a plate

48:13.360 --> 48:14.800
and you'll feel better about how things are going.

48:14.800 --> 48:16.160
A wooden plate.

48:16.160 --> 48:20.080
Maybe, and this is gonna mean different things

48:20.080 --> 48:22.440
to different people, arrange it.

48:22.440 --> 48:23.960
Okay.

48:23.960 --> 48:25.600
Interesting. Speak on that.

48:25.600 --> 48:26.800
What I would do- Travis, just explain

48:26.800 --> 48:29.520
how to do that in a way that screams class.

48:29.520 --> 48:31.880
I would take the tenders and kind of do them

48:31.880 --> 48:34.160
in like an alternating like log tower,

48:34.160 --> 48:37.380
like you would perhaps Jenga, maybe.

48:37.380 --> 48:38.920
Oh, that's gonna look real good.

48:38.920 --> 48:41.640
And then just pour the sauce down the middle.

48:41.640 --> 48:43.340
So it fills it up.

48:43.340 --> 48:45.660
Okay. That's funny, Trav.

48:45.660 --> 48:48.900
Yeah, and then put a little roof on top of it

48:48.900 --> 48:50.480
and then maybe sprinkle it.

48:51.880 --> 48:53.080
I don't know how this will work with it,

48:53.080 --> 48:54.720
but like with icing sugar,

48:54.720 --> 48:56.560
so it looks like a snowy wonderland

48:56.560 --> 49:00.520
and then maybe add some little marshmallow snowmen,

49:00.520 --> 49:05.160
maybe glue some M&Ms on there, a little Santa Claus.

49:05.160 --> 49:07.240
What were we talking about?

49:07.240 --> 49:10.760
I was about to ask a question, unless Griffin has a Yahoo.

49:10.760 --> 49:13.980
Yeah, I mean, gosh, we should address this one.

49:13.980 --> 49:15.560
It was sent in by Graham Roebuck.

49:15.560 --> 49:16.400
Thanks, Graham.

49:16.400 --> 49:18.400
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user

49:18.400 --> 49:20.200
who I am gonna call them.

49:20.200 --> 49:21.500
Denise asks,

49:21.500 --> 49:26.500
how can I make my dad like corn?

49:29.180 --> 49:30.760
Oh, Griffin, C or K.

49:30.760 --> 49:32.920
C or K, C or K, C or K.

49:32.920 --> 49:33.920
It's a C.

49:33.920 --> 49:34.820
Oh, okay.

49:34.820 --> 49:35.660
All right.

49:35.660 --> 49:40.660
Good, my 100% dad's like corn theory still holds.

49:41.800 --> 49:43.000
With a K, right?

49:43.000 --> 49:43.840
Yes, thank you.

49:43.840 --> 49:44.760
We need to be able to,

49:44.760 --> 49:46.380
it is so fucked up that these two,

49:46.380 --> 49:48.680
I'm trying to teach Henry the phonetic alphabet

49:48.680 --> 49:50.640
and it's so fucked up that these two letters

49:50.640 --> 49:52.520
do the same fucking thing.

49:52.520 --> 49:53.440
It's the same thing.

49:53.440 --> 49:54.280
It's pointless.

49:54.280 --> 49:55.220
Get rid of one of them.

49:55.220 --> 49:56.680
Make them fight in the winter.

49:56.680 --> 49:58.160
I think C should get to stay

49:58.160 --> 49:59.840
because C can do a lot of other stuff.

49:59.840 --> 50:00.680
K is always-

50:00.680 --> 50:03.480
Oh, no, see, what I would say, Griffin,

50:03.480 --> 50:06.480
what needs to happen is C needs to stay in its lane.

50:06.480 --> 50:08.720
Stick with that, well, I guess that it's the S sound.

50:08.720 --> 50:09.880
We have an S for that too.

50:09.880 --> 50:11.760
We got the S sound, see?

50:11.760 --> 50:13.120
Maybe get rid of the C.

50:13.120 --> 50:14.280
We have the K and the S.

50:14.280 --> 50:16.520
They are doing their individualized jobs.

50:16.520 --> 50:17.600
Okay, anyway.

50:17.600 --> 50:18.520
Okay.

50:18.520 --> 50:20.520
What if we just started pronouncing the band's name

50:20.520 --> 50:22.200
C-Horn.

50:22.200 --> 50:23.520
C-Horn.

50:23.520 --> 50:24.360
C-Horn.

50:24.360 --> 50:25.560
Help this person.

50:25.560 --> 50:27.800
How do they make their dad like corn?

50:27.800 --> 50:30.620
Play him some corn while they're eating corn.

50:31.640 --> 50:33.360
I want you to hear the difference.

50:33.360 --> 50:34.680
Okay, there's a lot of great ways

50:34.680 --> 50:36.400
I can tell you how to cook corn.

50:36.400 --> 50:38.320
Because if I say it wrong and say,

50:38.320 --> 50:41.900
I like to eat corn, then I'm going to jail.

50:44.240 --> 50:46.820
Okay, there's lots of good ways to make corn.

50:46.820 --> 50:50.780
For me, for my money, nice elote.

50:50.780 --> 50:53.020
Now I'll eat that, I'll eat that.

50:53.020 --> 50:53.860
But I'll eat it on the cob.

50:53.860 --> 50:55.340
I like me a cornbread.

50:55.340 --> 50:56.180
Corn, okay.

50:56.180 --> 50:57.200
It's sweet.

50:57.200 --> 50:58.040
You know what I like?

50:58.040 --> 50:59.860
Cornbread, you put some broccoli in there.

50:59.860 --> 51:00.780
It's really great.

51:00.780 --> 51:02.980
I don't think we can extrapolate quite that far, Trav.

51:02.980 --> 51:04.340
Because I think you could say like,

51:04.340 --> 51:07.580
well, there's corn syrup in your airheads

51:07.580 --> 51:09.340
that you love to eat.

51:09.340 --> 51:11.180
No, I understand that, Griffin.

51:11.180 --> 51:15.180
But I'm saying cornbread, corn like tortillas,

51:15.180 --> 51:18.600
like these things, your corn flakes,

51:18.600 --> 51:21.420
these are pretty corn direct.

51:21.420 --> 51:22.840
You know what I mean?

51:22.840 --> 51:25.640
It's like saying you don't like eggs,

51:25.640 --> 51:28.520
where there are so many different versions of eggs.

51:28.520 --> 51:30.400
It's hard for me to believe that.

51:32.960 --> 51:35.080
Justin, you got anything on this one?

51:36.680 --> 51:39.840
I have a really good Mexican street corn empanada

51:39.840 --> 51:42.340
at Nomada, that bakery in Huntington.

51:42.340 --> 51:43.980
Yeah.

51:43.980 --> 51:45.260
That would be a great place

51:45.260 --> 51:47.420
because there it's served up on a little,

51:47.420 --> 51:48.660
first off, it's vegetarian.

51:48.660 --> 51:49.500
Gotta love that.

51:50.680 --> 51:52.240
And also it's served up,

51:52.240 --> 51:55.140
there's just like eight pieces of corn on it, really.

51:55.140 --> 51:56.900
So it's kind of like you wouldn't even,

51:56.900 --> 51:58.020
it's like I do with my kids.

51:58.020 --> 51:59.620
Like you didn't even know you were eating corn.

51:59.620 --> 52:02.220
Oh, it's not inside the empanada?

52:02.220 --> 52:03.060
It might be.

52:03.060 --> 52:04.420
It might be hidden from me.

52:04.420 --> 52:05.260
I don't know.

52:05.260 --> 52:06.080
See, you gotta watch that.

52:06.080 --> 52:07.340
But I can see there's visible corn.

52:07.340 --> 52:09.100
If your dad thinks you're tricking him,

52:09.100 --> 52:10.920
oh God, dads hate that.

52:10.920 --> 52:11.760
No, they hate me.

52:11.760 --> 52:14.060
I do not like deception of any sort.

52:14.060 --> 52:15.260
I remember one time,

52:15.260 --> 52:17.540
my daddy was eating a cake that I made him

52:17.540 --> 52:19.180
and he was just about to take a bite

52:19.180 --> 52:20.420
and then he peeled the layers apart

52:20.420 --> 52:22.260
and he found a piece of broccoli in there.

52:22.260 --> 52:24.500
And he didn't talk to me for two weeks.

52:24.500 --> 52:27.140
I would tell you that happened to me in school

52:27.140 --> 52:29.620
where everybody was doing like science fair projects

52:29.620 --> 52:30.460
or something like that.

52:30.460 --> 52:33.660
And then one girl came in and gave everybody brownies

52:33.660 --> 52:34.620
and we all ate the brownies.

52:34.620 --> 52:36.200
And she was like, did you like them?

52:36.200 --> 52:38.420
They were all made out of green peppers.

52:38.420 --> 52:40.340
And I wanted to be like, hey,

52:40.340 --> 52:42.980
one of us could have been wicked allergic to green peppers.

52:42.980 --> 52:45.780
Pretty risky gamble you just did there, Katie.

52:45.780 --> 52:46.620
Damn.

52:48.180 --> 52:49.600
Also, gross.

52:49.600 --> 52:52.180
Get my fucking permission.

52:52.180 --> 52:54.520
Green pepper is my least favorite vegetable.

52:54.520 --> 52:55.360
And I do not like-

52:55.360 --> 52:56.580
No, you don't mean that.

52:56.580 --> 53:00.340
I do not like psychically the idea that I liked it.

53:00.340 --> 53:01.180
You know what I mean?

53:01.180 --> 53:03.660
I'm not willing to change my mind about that, Katie.

53:03.660 --> 53:04.500
Okay.

53:05.620 --> 53:08.340
What is your least favorite vegetable, everybody?

53:08.340 --> 53:09.740
My least favorite?

53:09.740 --> 53:11.180
What's your least favorite vegetable?

53:11.180 --> 53:12.500
I think a lima bean.

53:12.500 --> 53:13.500
It's hard to choose,

53:13.500 --> 53:14.980
because by and large, not good.

53:14.980 --> 53:15.820
Not good.

53:15.820 --> 53:16.640
That's not true.

53:16.640 --> 53:18.640
I love those green things, man.

53:18.640 --> 53:20.860
They make me feel powerful and strong.

53:20.860 --> 53:25.240
I think peas are like corn's evil nephew

53:25.240 --> 53:27.560
and they taste so gross.

53:27.560 --> 53:32.560
And they have the texture of the casing never quite goes away.

53:34.300 --> 53:36.020
It sucks, man.

53:36.020 --> 53:37.960
You don't want to hear about my least favorite.

53:37.960 --> 53:40.020
I want to know Justin's least favorite vegetable.

53:40.020 --> 53:41.560
French cut green beans.

53:42.700 --> 53:44.220
I think they're fucking vulgar.

53:45.220 --> 53:46.420
I want to talk about,

53:46.420 --> 53:47.540
when we're talking about vegetables,

53:47.540 --> 53:49.500
I found a new one that I liked this week.

53:49.500 --> 53:50.340
Oh boy.

53:50.340 --> 53:52.260
This is a story from my life.

53:52.260 --> 53:53.580
People are always asking us to share

53:53.580 --> 53:54.940
more stories from our lives.

53:54.940 --> 53:57.060
Yeah, we stay on topic too much.

53:57.060 --> 53:57.900
It's true.

53:57.900 --> 53:59.620
It's a story that happened to me this week.

53:59.620 --> 54:01.060
Blue Apron, you know I love Blue Apron.

54:01.060 --> 54:01.900
Yeah.

54:03.620 --> 54:06.320
There was a recipe this week or last week,

54:06.320 --> 54:07.500
I can't remember now,

54:07.500 --> 54:09.620
but cause time is meaningless.

54:09.620 --> 54:12.380
And it had, sometimes Blue Apron does this to me

54:12.380 --> 54:14.300
where they'll get me hooked on a new ingredient.

54:14.300 --> 54:16.100
And I'm like, whoa, I'm wild about this stuff.

54:16.100 --> 54:17.340
I can't get that in my house.

54:17.340 --> 54:18.180
No.

54:18.180 --> 54:19.000
They don't have it here.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.900
And this time it was delicata squash.

54:20.900 --> 54:22.100
Oh yeah.

54:22.100 --> 54:23.820
Was this the butter chicken and squash?

54:23.820 --> 54:25.300
Oh yes it was.

54:25.300 --> 54:26.140
Yeah it was.

54:26.140 --> 54:28.460
This delicata squash, it roasted up so good.

54:28.460 --> 54:29.880
Oh my golly.

54:29.880 --> 54:31.580
I was wild about this stuff.

54:31.580 --> 54:34.460
So then I'm putting it in an order at the grocery store

54:34.460 --> 54:36.620
and I searched delicata squash

54:36.620 --> 54:39.500
and it doesn't surprise me that they don't have it.

54:39.500 --> 54:41.580
In fact, the website crashed.

54:41.580 --> 54:44.700
One thing that they did have was an assortment

54:44.700 --> 54:46.900
of five squashes in a bag.

54:46.900 --> 54:49.700
So I bought that and then it showed up

54:49.700 --> 54:54.700
and I somehow missed the part on the listing for the item

54:55.020 --> 54:56.540
or maybe it wasn't there, I don't know,

54:56.540 --> 54:59.780
where it said decorative, decorative squashes.

55:00.640 --> 55:02.980
So then I got a problem.

55:02.980 --> 55:07.180
My problem is one of them kind of looks like a small

55:07.180 --> 55:09.860
delicata squash, kind of like I ate before.

55:10.980 --> 55:15.220
And I don't want, they're real squashes,

55:15.220 --> 55:17.100
but I don't want to be, so now I'm like,

55:17.100 --> 55:20.500
could I hook you guys up and eat you?

55:20.500 --> 55:23.500
But I don't want to be the guy that goes to the hospital

55:23.500 --> 55:28.500
for eating something that like fucking says decorative

55:28.660 --> 55:29.860
on the bag.

55:29.860 --> 55:34.860
So fast forward, I'm now the kind of guy who has,

55:35.060 --> 55:38.700
we're the kind of household that has a bowl

55:38.700 --> 55:40.180
with a bunch of squash in it

55:40.180 --> 55:42.340
to celebrate the season arriving.

55:42.340 --> 55:44.540
And I was wondering how that happened.

55:44.540 --> 55:45.580
How does that happen to you?

55:45.580 --> 55:46.620
That you just end up like,

55:46.620 --> 55:49.620
I gotta get some decorative squash for the season arriving.

55:49.620 --> 55:51.220
And this is how it happened to me.

55:51.220 --> 55:54.060
Maybe they'll stick around and not go bad, I don't know.

55:54.060 --> 55:54.940
They're decorative.

55:54.940 --> 55:59.260
Or maybe in a moment of temptation, you will eat them.

55:59.260 --> 56:01.220
Justin, I don't think you realize

56:01.220 --> 56:04.820
the bigger revelation right now is that in your house,

56:04.820 --> 56:09.060
you have vegetables and foodstuffs that are good for eating.

56:09.060 --> 56:12.660
And then this special like Wilbur and Charlotte's Web,

56:12.660 --> 56:15.780
like these gourds have been given a reprieve.

56:15.780 --> 56:19.020
This is, what you've got here is you have a fish

56:19.020 --> 56:21.460
in a goldfish bowl, while over here,

56:21.460 --> 56:25.300
you're making some tilapia for dinner, right?

56:25.300 --> 56:27.820
You have pet betta fish at the Red Lobster restaurant

56:27.820 --> 56:30.340
you work at is fucked up.

56:30.340 --> 56:34.340
Those gourds have to watch you eat vegetables.

56:34.340 --> 56:35.900
Better than the alternative though, isn't it?

56:35.900 --> 56:37.940
Well, yeah, but it kind of seems like you're saying,

56:37.940 --> 56:40.860
don't fuck up gourds, this could be you.

56:40.860 --> 56:41.700
Gourds stay in line.

56:41.700 --> 56:43.020
Or I'm saying to my other vegetables,

56:43.020 --> 56:47.060
be more beautiful and seasonal.

56:47.060 --> 56:48.940
You know, every vegetable is decorative

56:48.940 --> 56:50.420
depending on what you're into.

56:50.420 --> 56:51.860
That's what I'm saying.

56:51.860 --> 56:54.140
This is what is so challenging to me.

56:54.140 --> 56:56.020
Do you want me to not eat these gourds?

56:56.020 --> 56:57.340
You have to say not for,

56:57.340 --> 56:59.940
that also doesn't say not for eating.

56:59.940 --> 57:02.860
It doesn't say recommended decorative.

57:02.860 --> 57:04.740
Right, exactly.

57:04.740 --> 57:07.940
I've got a farmer coming over tomorrow, gourds.

57:07.940 --> 57:09.420
And if I get the green light,

57:11.220 --> 57:14.860
you're going in a fucking casserole.

57:14.860 --> 57:16.980
Thanks so much for listening to our podcast.

57:16.980 --> 57:18.180
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

57:18.180 --> 57:20.380
We sure have loved being here with you.

57:20.380 --> 57:22.340
I want to ask a quick favor of you.

57:22.340 --> 57:23.980
Well, Justin, before you do that,

57:23.980 --> 57:25.460
I want to ask you a quick favor

57:25.460 --> 57:28.500
because I want him to listen to one of my favorite podcasts.

57:28.500 --> 57:29.340
Oh my God.

57:29.340 --> 57:31.340
A podcast called The Besties.

57:31.340 --> 57:32.180
Tell me about it.

57:32.180 --> 57:34.940
I listen to it, no joke, every week.

57:34.940 --> 57:37.020
It is my brothers, Justin and Griffin,

57:37.020 --> 57:39.380
as well as Chris Plant and Rush Frustrick.

57:40.380 --> 57:42.380
And they talk about video games,

57:42.380 --> 57:44.140
but they talk about video games in such a way

57:44.140 --> 57:46.420
that I, a video game enthusiast

57:46.420 --> 57:50.100
that knows nothing about like current video games events,

57:50.100 --> 57:51.420
finds fascinating.

57:51.420 --> 57:53.220
They tell you about games that are coming out,

57:53.220 --> 57:55.540
things you'll be interested in that you've never heard of,

57:55.540 --> 57:58.420
plus great discussions about games that you love.

57:58.420 --> 58:01.220
And it's not just like tearing the games apart.

58:01.220 --> 58:04.460
It really teaches you about like the gaming industry,

58:04.460 --> 58:06.780
teaches you about the games that are coming out.

58:06.780 --> 58:09.500
There's so much going on now with the console wars,

58:09.500 --> 58:11.860
with the new generation of PlayStation 5

58:11.860 --> 58:13.100
and the next Xbox.

58:13.100 --> 58:14.500
And hearing you guys talk about it

58:14.500 --> 58:16.820
has made it make a lot of sense for me.

58:16.820 --> 58:18.340
I listen to it every week.

58:18.340 --> 58:19.180
And you know what?

58:19.180 --> 58:20.220
Even Bebe likes it

58:20.220 --> 58:22.660
because she thinks you guys are very funny.

58:22.660 --> 58:23.660
That's so nice.

58:23.660 --> 58:25.900
You can find it on Spotify.

58:25.900 --> 58:28.500
So go there, listen to it, subscribe.

58:28.500 --> 58:29.940
It's out every Friday.

58:29.940 --> 58:31.300
I do not miss an episode.

58:31.300 --> 58:32.340
Highly recommend it.

58:32.340 --> 58:33.900
Thanks, Travis. Thank you, Travis.

58:33.900 --> 58:34.740
You're welcome.

58:34.740 --> 58:36.500
I don't have anything anymore.

58:36.500 --> 58:37.940
Oh, what were you gonna say?

58:37.940 --> 58:38.980
You stole my thing.

58:38.980 --> 58:41.340
Oh, you were gonna talk about your own podcast?

58:41.340 --> 58:42.380
Goosh.

58:42.380 --> 58:43.220
Goosh.

58:45.100 --> 58:47.220
The Avengers and Crystal Kingdom

58:47.220 --> 58:48.900
is now available for pre-order.

58:48.900 --> 58:51.780
That is a graphic novel based on the arc of the podcast.

58:51.780 --> 58:52.820
Yeah.

58:52.820 --> 58:54.540
We did it again.

58:54.540 --> 58:56.580
TheAvengersZoneComic.com.

58:56.580 --> 58:59.860
That's coming July 13th, 2020.

58:59.860 --> 59:00.700
One.

59:00.700 --> 59:01.820
2021.

59:01.820 --> 59:02.820
One.

59:02.820 --> 59:03.660
The future.

59:03.660 --> 59:05.740
And I believe I have personally guaranteed

59:05.740 --> 59:07.740
in other venues, and I will do so here,

59:07.740 --> 59:10.220
that you will be able to enjoy that graphic novel

59:10.220 --> 59:13.580
in a crowd of people and all will be safe.

59:13.580 --> 59:15.820
That was a big cold shot for old Justin.

59:15.820 --> 59:17.620
A big cold shot from me.

59:17.620 --> 59:19.340
Oh, he's pointing at the stands

59:19.340 --> 59:22.180
where there's lots of people sitting close together.

59:23.380 --> 59:24.340
We got some new merch out.

59:24.340 --> 59:25.980
If you haven't gone to McElroyMerch.com

59:25.980 --> 59:27.060
and checked it out, you should.

59:27.060 --> 59:28.740
We got a new pin of the month

59:28.740 --> 59:31.820
that is based on the phrase Tiger on the Table,

59:31.820 --> 59:33.620
designed by Sam Schultz.

59:33.620 --> 59:35.340
And the proceeds from that benefit

59:35.340 --> 59:36.940
the Marshall P. Johnson Institute,

59:36.940 --> 59:38.980
which defends and protects the human rights

59:38.980 --> 59:41.500
of black transgender and gender nonconforming people,

59:41.500 --> 59:44.340
as well as the Sylvia Rivera Law Project,

59:44.340 --> 59:46.540
which works to guarantee that all people are free

59:46.540 --> 59:49.380
to determine their gender identity and expression.

59:49.380 --> 59:51.300
We also have a new Candle Nights ornament

59:51.300 --> 59:53.580
by Lynn Doyle that is super cute,

59:53.580 --> 59:56.900
as well as a Candle Nights wrapping paper by Justin Gray,

59:56.900 --> 59:59.020
and this little jump scare pin of Justin

59:59.020 --> 01:00:00.940
doing the jump scare from the TV show.

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:01.980
It's so good.

01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:03.820
McElroyMerch.com.

01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:07.980
Also, speaking of books and things you can order,

01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:10.580
we wrote a how-to podcast book

01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:13.300
called Everybody Has a Podcast Except You,

01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:14.980
and it's available for pre-order now

01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:17.820
at McElroyPodcastBook.com.

01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:20.060
We are working this week,

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:23.020
we are recording the audio book,

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:24.380
and we're narrating it,

01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:26.460
and let me see, just reading again,

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:27.380
it's pretty funny.

01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:29.180
I'm having a really good time reading it.

01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:30.660
And I think you will too.

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:32.340
It comes out in January.

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:34.540
Pre-order it now, and in January,

01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:36.980
you can learn to make a podcast that you're proud of

01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:38.700
and enjoy reading a book.

01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:40.340
It's two things in one.

01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:42.700
Did you mention that we now have a thanks for vibing

01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:43.540
and keeping it tight?

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:44.380
Sure.

01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:45.260
Do we?

01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:46.220
Is that up?

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:47.420
Yeah, that's new.

01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:48.260
Check that out too.

01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:49.580
McElroyMerch, and then pre-order the book

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:51.580
at McElroyPodcastBook.com.

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:54.500
That is a funny situation because we didn't say that.

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:56.660
It was on a Jumbotron,

01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:58.500
so we had to reach out to the person

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:01.060
that said that funny thing in a Jumbotron

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:03.620
to ask them if it was okay to make a T-shirt.

01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:05.060
And we told them we would give them money

01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:06.900
for the T-shirts and get this.

01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:08.420
They actually requested instead

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:10.500
that a portion be donated to the Young Center

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.860
for Immigrant Children's Rights.

01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:13.020
So what's up?

01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:14.940
Best fans in the world said it before.

01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:16.460
I will continue to say it.

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:18.940
That's it, right?

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:19.780
Yeah.

01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:21.100
I have a final, I have a final.

01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:21.940
John Roderick.

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:22.780
In the long winter season.

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:24.140
He says he don't get to the park

01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:25.860
until the day's to bed.

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:26.780
Thank you, John.

01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:28.380
Thank you to Maximum Fun.

01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:32.980
Okay, so this one's sent in by Steven.

01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:35.900
It's, oh man, it's asked by, oh man.

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:37.340
Who's it asked by, Griffin?

01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:41.380
Bee Yatch Chick.

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:42.220
Oh boy.

01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:47.220
Guys, Yahoo will tell you how old the answers are

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:50.260
or how old the question is, right?

01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:53.620
Griffin, is it possible that it's Bee Yatch Chick,

01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:54.820
like a yacht?

01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:55.900
That's probably it.

01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:56.900
Okay.

01:01:56.900 --> 01:02:00.940
This one is from, and it says this, one decade ago.

01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:01.780
Whoa.

01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:04.180
Isn't that wild that they would say that

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:05.980
and not 10 years ago?

01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:08.500
If this website stays up for 100 years,

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:11.060
will this say one century ago?

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.780
Yeah.

01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:15.900
This question from millennia's past.

01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:18.660
From the Mesozoic era.

01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:20.540
This one comes and it says,

01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:26.380
what are some exercises that don't give you yucky musculars?

01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:29.460
Oh, what was that, Smacker Roy?

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:30.620
I just, I just.

01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:31.460
I just.

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:32.300
I just.

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:33.140
I just.

01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:33.980
I just.

01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:34.820
I just.

01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:35.660
I just.

01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:36.500
I just.

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:37.340
I just.

01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:38.180
I just.

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:39.020
I just.

01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:39.860
I just.

01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:40.700
I just.

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:42.140
I'm Travis.

01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:43.660
I'm Griffin Macka-Roy.

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:44.700
This has been My Brother, My Brother,

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.020
May Kiss Your Dad.

01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:47.940
Square on the Lips.

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:49.880
ь

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:52.080
Make the girls do you want to,

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:55.080
just say that I wanna.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:08.580
Artist-owned.

01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:09.700
Audience-supported.

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:18.700
Do you like mysteries? Are you a fan of teenagers? Do you enjoy the struggles of lonely, middle-aged men?

01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:21.700
If so, may we recommend a TV show for you?

01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:24.700
Dicktown. The show is called Dicktown.

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:25.700
And I'm John Hodgman.

01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:27.700
And I'm David Ries of Dicktown.

01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:31.700
Our show, called Dicktown, is available now on Hulu.

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:38.700
John plays John Hunchman, a former prodigy child detective who used to solve mysteries for his classmates in North Carolina.

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:45.700
Now he's all grown up, living on a shabby houseboat, and still solving mysteries for teenagers on Dicktown.

01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:52.700
And David plays David Purfoy, my former bully and nemesis, and now my driver, muscle, and only friend.

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:57.700
There are mysteries popping off all over the place. The mystery of the controversial cosplay.

01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:03.700
The mystery of the maybe-boyfriend. The mystery of the mumbling rapper.

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:07.700
And there are celebrity guest stars popping off all over the place.

01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:13.700
Zach Galifianakis, Kristen Schaal, Paul F. Tompkins, Anna Akana, H. John Benjamin. So many stars.

01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:22.700
So please, go to bit.ly slash dicktown. That's B-I-T dot L-Y slash D-I-C-K-T-O-W-M.

01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:26.700
That'll take you right to Hulu, where you can watch all ten episodes right now.

01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:32.700
John Hodgman is in full Wikipedia mode right now. Just go to the link and watch Dicktown and thank us later.

01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:35.700
Yeah, we made a TV show and called it Dicktown.

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:38.700
It's the only good thing that happened this year.
