00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:49.760
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me picks the Oscars.

00:50.320 --> 00:57.040
I'm going to start with the grouch. Oh, no, don't. Don't make that joke. Oh, fuck.

00:57.040 --> 00:58.080
You're going to start with what?

00:58.080 --> 01:00.000
The grouch.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.920
He said the grouch. What's your favorite Oscar, Travis?

01:05.520 --> 01:09.600
Mine is Oscar from The Odd Couple, and you should say, like, your name.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.480
Nope. I don't want to be associated with this goof.

01:12.480 --> 01:14.480
I like that spring-legged murderer.

01:15.520 --> 01:16.240
Sorry, which one?

01:16.240 --> 01:17.200
Pardon?

01:17.200 --> 01:23.360
The one that the blade-footed wife killer.

01:23.360 --> 01:24.800
Blade-footed wife killer Oscar.

01:25.360 --> 01:27.600
Oscar Pistorius.

01:27.600 --> 01:28.400
Pistorius.

01:28.400 --> 01:29.760
Oh, no!

01:29.760 --> 01:33.680
Blade-footed wife killer Oscar Pistorius is your favorite Oscar?

01:33.680 --> 01:36.320
See, I thought you were talking about Spring-heeled Jack,

01:37.120 --> 01:39.520
and it turned into a much worse thing.

01:39.520 --> 01:44.560
I know that's why I was confused. I was very lost as to the direction Griffin was taking it.

01:44.560 --> 01:50.800
This summer, in The Fugitive 2, Oscar Pistorius is on the run from the law

01:50.800 --> 01:54.960
as he races against time to find the two-legged man that killed his wife.

01:54.960 --> 01:58.960
I literally made that joke last week and on last week's Besties.

01:58.960 --> 02:00.720
I did it. It's never made it to press.

02:00.720 --> 02:01.680
That is a three-peat.

02:01.680 --> 02:04.160
It's never made it to press. It's never made it to press.

02:04.160 --> 02:05.120
It's always been before.

02:05.120 --> 02:06.640
That is a three-peat.

02:06.640 --> 02:09.680
Griffin, you edit both those shows. Has that ever made it to press?

02:10.320 --> 02:13.280
It's made it to my ears three times.

02:13.280 --> 02:14.880
Then just leave it in the show for once.

02:14.880 --> 02:21.760
Tragedy plus time equals comedy, and comedy plus time equals whatever that was.

02:21.760 --> 02:26.080
It circles back around and turns back to tragedy again.

02:27.120 --> 02:30.160
This is my brother. My brother reads an advice show for the modern era.

02:30.160 --> 02:33.120
The Oscars are over. Congratulations to Argo.

02:35.120 --> 02:37.680
You really think Argo's going to take it?

02:37.680 --> 02:39.040
I just haven't seen that many of them.

02:40.240 --> 02:43.920
Can I be honest with you guys? I don't even know who's nominated for Best Picture.

02:43.920 --> 02:46.880
God, you uncultured gilbers.

02:46.880 --> 02:53.280
The only movies I saw this year are Argo and the training DVD for my blender.

02:55.280 --> 03:00.160
Unless Lady Mixing Up Strawberries is nominated for Best Supporting Actress.

03:00.160 --> 03:02.560
It's picking up a lot of buzz with the foreign press, though.

03:03.840 --> 03:05.760
I mean, but they'll fucking watch anything.

03:06.640 --> 03:08.000
Have you guys seen Amour?

03:08.560 --> 03:13.360
It's like, oh, we get it. They're old and they're dying slow.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.720
It's like cocoon if the aliens didn't come down.

03:18.560 --> 03:20.720
It's just non-plot driven cocoon.

03:22.400 --> 03:26.400
It's like, you know how Waking Ned Divide is about old Irish people?

03:27.360 --> 03:31.040
It's like if you took cocoon and took out all the action sequences.

03:31.040 --> 03:31.360
Right.

03:32.240 --> 03:39.440
Take out Ned Beatty and Warren Beatty and Diabetes.

03:39.440 --> 03:40.240
What's his name?

03:40.240 --> 03:41.920
Diabetes Beatty.

03:41.920 --> 03:44.560
Diabetes Beatty.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.960
No, what's that, what's that, what's that?

03:46.960 --> 03:48.560
Woodrow Wilson.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.000
You're thinking of Ed Grimley.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.160
Oh my God, just give me a straight answer.

03:52.160 --> 03:54.640
Alfred Grimley, you son of a bitch.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.960
Okay, you guys talk one at a time, all right?

03:56.960 --> 03:59.520
Travis, what is Wilford Brimley's name?

03:59.520 --> 04:00.960
William Howard Taft.

04:00.960 --> 04:02.240
Okay, bad.

04:02.240 --> 04:04.000
Griffin, what is Wilford Brimley's name?

04:04.000 --> 04:09.840
Um, I fucking know this.

04:13.840 --> 04:14.800
What is cocoon?

04:14.800 --> 04:15.360
Fuck!

04:15.360 --> 04:16.880
Correct, that is correct.

04:16.880 --> 04:20.640
You did get it right with under the wire to go.

04:20.640 --> 04:22.080
This is My Brother, My Brother, Me.

04:22.080 --> 04:23.840
It's an advice show for the modern era.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.200
That's right, we're ready to help you.

04:25.200 --> 04:29.440
We've got our own stuff together and now we're gonna help you do the same thing.

04:29.440 --> 04:32.080
Is Wilford Brimley nominated for an Oscar this year?

04:32.080 --> 04:34.960
He's nominated for best dead person forever.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.000
He's not dead.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.040
He's dead as fuck.

04:38.160 --> 04:39.200
God, is he not dead?

04:40.400 --> 04:41.120
Wilford Brimley?

04:41.760 --> 04:42.560
Is he not dead?

04:43.120 --> 04:43.360
No.

04:44.080 --> 04:46.160
Wilford Brimley's alive as fuck.

04:46.160 --> 04:46.480
I know.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.960
That oatmeal is getting it done for you.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.000
It's true.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.440
He loves it.

04:51.440 --> 04:54.800
He stirs in a spoonful of insulin every day, keeps him going.

04:54.800 --> 04:58.160
Do you guys hear his voice when you eat oatmeal?

04:58.160 --> 05:00.000
Like, I think of that like,

05:00.000 --> 05:03.760
it's good, it's got good for your stuff in it to keep you going all day long.

05:03.760 --> 05:05.440
Like, oh, that's really good.

05:05.440 --> 05:06.080
I eat it.

05:06.080 --> 05:09.040
I hear really erotic things in Wilford Brimley's voice.

05:10.800 --> 05:11.760
Shove that right in.

05:12.960 --> 05:16.880
You know what else is rich and creamy and has flakes of oats in it?

05:19.520 --> 05:20.160
Oatmeal.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.400
Also might come.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.120
I'm a hundred.

05:23.920 --> 05:27.360
Okay, good, good show today.

05:27.360 --> 05:30.480
Over the last 15 months, I've lost around 100 pounds,

05:30.480 --> 05:33.040
built muscle and gotten more fit all around

05:33.040 --> 05:35.040
using just exercise and willpower.

05:35.040 --> 05:38.080
I now find myself with a tiny bit of something I never had,

05:38.080 --> 05:39.600
self-confidence.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.160
Are there any steps I can take to nurture and grow this confidence

05:42.160 --> 05:44.720
in the continuing attempt to be a better me?

05:44.720 --> 05:47.280
Thanks in advance, progressing in Pittsburgh.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.960
First of all, congratulations.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.160
That's fantastic.

05:52.160 --> 05:52.720
Way to go.

05:53.280 --> 05:54.080
I'm proud of you.

05:54.080 --> 05:58.640
Unless you weighed like 120 pounds beforehand and then like-

05:58.640 --> 06:01.760
I'm down to just a skull at this point, basically.

06:01.760 --> 06:05.120
This is beyond like a level of Kate Moss unhealthiness.

06:05.120 --> 06:07.680
This is like thinner.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.520
This is fucking bad news.

06:09.520 --> 06:10.960
You look fantastic.

06:10.960 --> 06:12.720
We're really worried about you.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.960
You weigh less than eight pairs of shoes.

06:14.960 --> 06:15.600
Yeah.

06:15.600 --> 06:16.640
I'm really worried.

06:17.360 --> 06:21.280
Justin, why do you continue to insist on comparing things to shoe weight?

06:21.280 --> 06:26.000
Because when I was in school, they told us that one pair of shoes weighs a kilogram.

06:26.720 --> 06:30.640
And so I somehow got it in my head that that's a pretty good system for measurement.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.920
That seems flawed because every shoe is different.

06:34.480 --> 06:39.600
Is that like one pair of adult male cowboy boots or like one stiletto heel?

06:40.160 --> 06:41.520
Every shoe is different, Travis.

06:41.520 --> 06:43.760
I think we would all do well to remember that.

06:43.760 --> 06:45.680
But they all have beautiful soles.

06:45.680 --> 06:47.040
Travis, you're such a carry.

06:49.040 --> 06:49.760
You guys.

06:49.760 --> 06:52.880
I would, man, it sounds like you got enough.

06:52.880 --> 06:58.160
You just wrote into a podcast to brag about how fucking super healthy you are.

06:58.160 --> 06:59.760
And that's great and everything.

06:59.760 --> 07:01.920
I wouldn't get any more confident than that.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.160
I think I think you go any further than that.

07:04.160 --> 07:04.880
Yeah, yeah.

07:04.880 --> 07:06.160
You're bordering on Hitler.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.160
Well, I'm not sure Hitler though.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.720
I'm saying that he gains a little bit more confidence.

07:12.720 --> 07:14.560
Pretty soon he's going to sleep through the world.

07:15.520 --> 07:18.320
No, I don't think so.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.480
No, I guess maybe.

07:21.600 --> 07:24.800
To be fair, I may not know the origins of Hitler.

07:24.800 --> 07:27.120
Hitler lost like a hundred pounds.

07:27.120 --> 07:29.120
What his whole scene is.

07:29.120 --> 07:32.000
Sort of what his place in history was.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.800
Like who the guy who the guy is.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.000
Any of it at all.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.120
It was that he did some paintings and got really confident.

07:39.840 --> 07:43.280
And turned that confidence into like a dictatorship.

07:43.280 --> 07:44.320
Yeah, that's true.

07:44.320 --> 07:44.820
Right?

07:44.820 --> 07:48.260
I mean, I am proud of you.

07:48.260 --> 07:50.020
It's just you don't want to...

07:52.740 --> 07:54.340
Do you want to be the next Jared?

07:54.340 --> 07:57.620
Like I hate to bring up Jared every fucking week on this show.

07:57.620 --> 08:00.020
But it does seem that way lately, doesn't it?

08:00.020 --> 08:01.060
It does kind of seem.

08:01.060 --> 08:02.500
Jared is the new ghosts.

08:02.500 --> 08:07.700
And like I worry because every time that dude comes on your TV.

08:07.700 --> 08:08.820
Like here it comes again.

08:08.820 --> 08:14.820
I'm getting another fucking earful from Jared about how eating nothing but Subway sandwiches

08:14.820 --> 08:16.580
turned his fucking life around.

08:16.580 --> 08:17.940
But he says it now in a way.

08:17.940 --> 08:23.060
He's like, I ate sandwiches until I half disappeared.

08:23.060 --> 08:24.580
And it's like, we get it, dude.

08:24.580 --> 08:31.300
And it's doubly irritating because you know now he has like the money to like pay someone for that.

08:31.300 --> 08:31.540
Right.

08:31.540 --> 08:32.100
You know what I mean?

08:32.100 --> 08:37.060
Like he has the money to hire a personal chef.

08:37.060 --> 08:41.540
Yeah, I don't think he's rolling into Subway and buying those sandwiches anymore.

08:41.540 --> 08:46.500
More importantly, he's got enough money that he can just put the weight back on again.

08:46.500 --> 08:50.100
Because like he has so much money.

08:50.100 --> 08:55.380
Even if he goes on like an eating spree, becomes the Burger King spokesperson for a year

08:55.380 --> 08:57.140
and then blimpos back up.

08:57.140 --> 09:01.940
He's still going to be extremely, extremely fuckable because all that skrill.

09:01.940 --> 09:05.380
We're losing the narrative of Jared.

09:05.380 --> 09:07.140
The narrative has lost its impact.

09:07.140 --> 09:14.340
I think he needs to put on like two Hyundai and be a spokesperson for Butterburger for a while.

09:14.340 --> 09:16.180
He needs a spiral is what you're saying.

09:16.180 --> 09:17.780
Yeah, he needs an arc.

09:19.220 --> 09:24.740
Specifically, he needs two arcs on either side of his body that represent his coming back.

09:26.260 --> 09:28.820
As goes Jared, so goes the country.

09:28.820 --> 09:34.260
I think if Jared becomes the BK spokesman, comes out, does a press conference says,

09:34.260 --> 09:36.340
I'm done with this healthy living.

09:36.340 --> 09:40.660
You only get one trip around this beautiful blue orb and I'm going to spend mine eating

09:40.660 --> 09:43.140
a sloppy dog or whatever they have at Burger King.

09:43.140 --> 09:44.580
I mean, they get some chicken.

09:44.580 --> 09:45.700
Mainly sloppy dogs.

09:45.700 --> 09:53.140
I'm going to get myself a sloppy dog chicken slipper combo, which is like an actual footwear

09:53.140 --> 09:54.260
made of fried chicken.

09:55.860 --> 09:57.940
He just really, really loses himself.

09:57.940 --> 10:06.740
Then a year later, he's back up to 450, flips back to Subway for Prodigal Son, comes back,

10:06.740 --> 10:09.540
and says, I'm doing it again, America, getting healthy for you.

10:10.260 --> 10:12.740
We didn't see him lose the weight the first time.

10:12.740 --> 10:20.180
We were just like, all we got was a skinny, nerd-ass looking dude with some big old pants.

10:20.180 --> 10:23.060
I'm not sure that that's good evidence for me.

10:23.060 --> 10:24.980
Did he start the big pants movement?

10:24.980 --> 10:29.540
I know, but it's one of my favorite things in weight loss commercials where it's like,

10:29.540 --> 10:30.740
I've got big pants.

10:30.740 --> 10:31.620
Oh, good for you.

10:33.060 --> 10:38.100
Because maybe what you don't see is he's got giant legs when he was fat, but his torso

10:38.100 --> 10:39.220
is completely normal.

10:41.780 --> 10:43.780
I saw Norbert, you know?

10:43.780 --> 10:44.420
Yeah, sure.

10:45.940 --> 10:48.180
This is not Jermaine, you just wanted to brag that you-

10:48.980 --> 10:52.340
You were one of the three people in the country that saw Norbert.

10:52.340 --> 10:55.060
I did see Norbert.

10:55.060 --> 10:55.780
I'm not ashamed.

10:58.420 --> 11:02.420
If you were to ask if I've seen Norbert or not, the answer is yes.

11:02.420 --> 11:03.060
I saw it.

11:06.020 --> 11:08.020
I don't know how to tell somebody to have comp-

11:10.180 --> 11:12.820
When somebody walks up and says, how would you evaluate yourself?

11:12.820 --> 11:14.580
Just go pretty good, I guess.

11:14.580 --> 11:15.460
That's it.

11:15.460 --> 11:16.420
And then you have confidence.

11:16.420 --> 11:18.020
Moving on up, getting better.

11:18.020 --> 11:21.940
I don't know, it's just one of those things where it's like, you could, I don't know,

11:21.940 --> 11:25.620
is it a fake it till you make it thing or just keep taking care of yourself?

11:25.620 --> 11:28.420
But the more you care for yourself, the more you like yourself and the more confidence

11:28.420 --> 11:28.920
you'll have.

11:29.700 --> 11:30.740
That's what I have to assume.

11:31.540 --> 11:34.500
I don't think you just wake up one day and be like, I'm confident now.

11:35.540 --> 11:43.780
I have noticed that, maybe not, this may not be necessarily confidence, but in terms of

11:43.780 --> 11:52.260
just keeping yourself going, I think that I've had some success with doing a little

11:52.260 --> 12:00.260
bit of exercise in the mornings, kind of sending yourself the signal that it's worth taking

12:00.260 --> 12:00.980
care of yourself.

12:02.340 --> 12:06.180
And I think that if you do a little bit of that kind of stuff every day, you do stuff

12:06.180 --> 12:12.260
like increase your water intake and just take a couple seconds out of your day to

12:12.260 --> 12:17.460
look after yourself, take care of yourself, do something for you for once.

12:17.460 --> 12:22.340
Do some sit ups, put a mirror on the floor and then squat over it and then like really

12:22.340 --> 12:23.780
get a good look in there.

12:25.060 --> 12:25.700
In where?

12:26.420 --> 12:26.820
Where?

12:28.020 --> 12:28.820
In your gay-per?

12:29.380 --> 12:30.420
Is that what you're saying to me?

12:34.100 --> 12:36.420
I say, you know, in the deep dark pit that is your chain.

12:36.420 --> 12:40.260
You gotta love, you gotta love the skin you're in, Dove.

12:40.260 --> 12:46.020
I think everybody has had the experience of maybe getting out of the shower or something

12:46.020 --> 12:51.620
or being nude for some reason and getting up or going to like change or something and

12:51.620 --> 12:55.620
you get a look of yourself, like you get a look of yourself in the mirror that's like,

12:55.620 --> 13:00.820
I did not know I had that angle, you know, like I did not know that was part of my look.

13:00.820 --> 13:07.540
Yeah, I feel like I, yes, for me I feel like it's precipitously just getting, I feel like

13:07.540 --> 13:10.420
I've aged like 10 years in the past three months.

13:10.420 --> 13:15.540
I don't know what it is, I just look at my skin and it's just sallow and I don't feel

13:15.540 --> 13:17.700
great about myself, I guess is what I'm saying.

13:17.700 --> 13:22.660
Well, you know what I do, I have rampant narcissism and so I just think I'm fucking awesome.

13:22.660 --> 13:24.020
Yeah, that helps, I guess.

13:24.020 --> 13:25.300
It does, it helps so much.

13:26.100 --> 13:30.820
Yeah, Travis is a man that is very familiar with bathroom floor mirrors.

13:30.820 --> 13:31.860
Oh God, yes.

13:31.860 --> 13:34.420
In fact, my entire bathroom floor is just made of mirrors.

13:34.420 --> 13:35.460
Yeah, cut out the middle man.

13:35.460 --> 13:38.100
Yeah, the problem is it's really slippery.

13:38.100 --> 13:40.100
Oh man, do you guys want to Yahoo?

13:40.820 --> 13:41.700
Yes, please.

13:41.700 --> 13:42.500
Crab-solutely.

13:43.140 --> 13:43.860
What?

13:43.860 --> 13:46.500
That's my new thing where I pretend I'm a crab.

13:46.500 --> 13:47.300
Uh-huh.

13:47.300 --> 13:47.780
Is this going to be the-

13:47.780 --> 13:51.940
Crab-solutely, it's all like crab puns, like crab-solutely and you got to be crabbing me

13:51.940 --> 13:53.380
and I'm feeling kind of crabby.

13:53.380 --> 13:56.500
Wait, wait, wait, wait, how is you got to be crabbing me a pun?

13:58.260 --> 13:59.460
It's a pun on shitting.

13:59.460 --> 14:02.420
Is that like smurfing me?

14:02.420 --> 14:02.900
Uh-huh.

14:02.900 --> 14:03.460
I got you.

14:03.460 --> 14:09.540
Oh, okay, so I see, so it's like crabbing is like a noun and a verb and an adverb and an adjective

14:09.540 --> 14:10.260
and-

14:10.260 --> 14:10.900
Yeah.

14:10.900 --> 14:15.940
I'm tired of all these crabbing crabsikins taking all our jobs.

14:15.940 --> 14:17.140
Oh, it's also racist.

14:17.780 --> 14:19.380
Like a racist crab.

14:19.380 --> 14:22.180
Guys, my boyfriend wants me to crab on him.

14:22.180 --> 14:22.680
What?

14:23.300 --> 14:23.800
What?

14:25.060 --> 14:26.980
Oscar Pistorius crabbed his wife.

14:26.980 --> 14:27.220
No.

14:27.780 --> 14:28.500
Crabbed his crab.

14:29.140 --> 14:30.180
Is that funny?

14:30.180 --> 14:33.460
And then they put him in the crab electric chair.

14:33.460 --> 14:35.940
But you just said electric on the end of crab.

14:36.900 --> 14:37.400
Okay.

14:37.860 --> 14:40.260
Griffin, do you want to go ahead and crab this question?

14:40.260 --> 14:43.860
Yeah, this Yahoo was sent in by Jacob Locker.

14:43.860 --> 14:45.300
The prodigal son returns.

14:46.660 --> 14:49.460
Why did you say it like a creepy accountant?

14:49.460 --> 14:54.500
Well, because that's his punishment for not making it on the show lately.

14:54.500 --> 15:00.500
It was asked by Yahoo Answers user, Risha, who asks, are there any phone apps that you

15:00.500 --> 15:04.420
can download to make your butt look bigger or make your butt bigger?

15:06.420 --> 15:10.260
To make your butt look bigger or make your butt bigger?

15:10.260 --> 15:12.900
What a wide gulf between perception and reality.

15:12.900 --> 15:14.980
This person does not seem to grasp it.

15:14.980 --> 15:19.700
Are you saying like an application that can bend reality to your-

15:19.700 --> 15:25.300
Like, okay, what if she's asking to make it appear bigger or something?

15:25.300 --> 15:27.700
It makes your butt bigger, but it does not appear bigger.

15:27.700 --> 15:28.820
She's fine either way.

15:29.700 --> 15:31.780
Man, we're getting into some string theory shit, though.

15:31.780 --> 15:33.060
That's some Schrodinger's cat.

15:33.060 --> 15:35.460
If Schrodinger's cat had a fat ass-

15:35.460 --> 15:37.300
Just put your ass in a box.

15:37.300 --> 15:41.220
And then depending on if somebody looks at it or not, it may or may not be bigger.

15:41.780 --> 15:44.020
It is dead in both universes.

15:44.020 --> 15:44.820
Or wait, it's alive.

15:45.780 --> 15:46.660
How is Schrodinger's-

15:46.660 --> 15:50.020
One butt cheek is alive and one butt cheek is dead.

15:50.020 --> 15:52.500
I get like that sometimes when I sit weird at the movies.

15:53.940 --> 15:59.460
What you gotta watch out for is when one butt cheek consumes the other one within the box.

15:59.460 --> 16:01.060
Let's make this simpler.

16:01.860 --> 16:08.500
Of course there are 5,000 iPhone apps that make your butt look bigger.

16:09.380 --> 16:12.260
There are 5,000 competing companies.

16:12.260 --> 16:18.660
There's a startup company that began in San Francisco that was completely originated.

16:18.660 --> 16:23.380
Somebody's full-time employment is Funny Butt Cam, which is an app.

16:23.380 --> 16:25.460
There's Funny Butt Cam, there's iButt.

16:25.460 --> 16:27.540
There's iButt, which is fighting against it.

16:27.540 --> 16:30.980
And they actually have a copyright suit against it.

16:30.980 --> 16:33.540
It's a lot of Silicon Valley politicking.

16:35.940 --> 16:36.420
I don't-

16:36.420 --> 16:42.580
Let's take quick odds on iButt being an actual app available right now in the App Store.

16:42.580 --> 16:43.620
One to one.

16:43.620 --> 16:43.860
Okay.

16:44.660 --> 16:46.020
It is a statistical-

16:46.020 --> 16:47.460
I would say zero to one.

16:48.180 --> 16:49.780
Let's do a parlay.

16:50.900 --> 16:52.100
What does it do?

16:52.100 --> 16:54.020
Is it just another fart piano?

16:54.020 --> 16:55.620
Is it a Funny Butt Cam?

16:56.180 --> 16:57.300
What are we talking about?

16:57.300 --> 16:59.620
I bet it's something that you could take pictures of your friends

16:59.620 --> 17:02.500
and somehow superimpose butts onto their faces.

17:02.500 --> 17:03.060
Oh, I see.

17:03.060 --> 17:05.460
Or maybe it just erases their shorts.

17:05.460 --> 17:07.300
I think you would just call that Butt Head, right?

17:07.300 --> 17:07.700
Yeah.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.140
Oh, that's a better name.

17:09.140 --> 17:10.020
Or Butt Face.

17:10.020 --> 17:11.060
Butt Face is probably-

17:11.060 --> 17:13.540
Butt Facebook is probably a good way to go.

17:13.540 --> 17:14.740
Butt Facebook!

17:14.740 --> 17:15.540
Sure, why not?

17:16.420 --> 17:18.020
This is an untapped market.

17:18.020 --> 17:18.820
Yeah.

17:18.820 --> 17:21.060
I guess I feel like this is like a quantum thing

17:21.060 --> 17:25.380
where as we even consider the possibility of these different things,

17:25.380 --> 17:28.100
they simultaneously become extant.

17:28.100 --> 17:29.380
Okay, super quick.

17:30.100 --> 17:34.740
I tried to search for iButt and it suggested I search instead for

17:34.740 --> 17:38.020
iButterfly, which is very different.

17:38.020 --> 17:38.260
Yeah.

17:39.860 --> 17:43.380
A much different approach to the whole big fat ass thing.

17:43.380 --> 17:48.180
There are no apps called iButt, which I assume has to be old Steve.

17:48.180 --> 17:51.860
But what Travis is saying is that by saying it,

17:53.140 --> 17:57.860
there is a JavaScript programmer right now furiously typing out

17:57.860 --> 18:02.340
what he needs to get iButt on the market before the episode is over.

18:02.340 --> 18:03.460
Uh-huh.

18:03.460 --> 18:05.140
Who's listening in though?

18:05.860 --> 18:08.500
That's their fucking spies everywhere, man.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.020
Thanks, WikiLeaks.

18:10.020 --> 18:11.140
Thanks, WikiLeaks.

18:11.140 --> 18:14.500
I've been using my fitness pal to help me shed the LBs.

18:15.140 --> 18:18.420
17 LBs in 2013 as of last Wednesday.

18:18.420 --> 18:19.700
That's so dope.

18:19.700 --> 18:20.740
Thank you very much.

18:20.740 --> 18:22.340
Why don't you get my fitness enemy?

18:25.380 --> 18:30.100
Okay, my fitness enemy not only tracks the special kind of foods that you eat

18:30.100 --> 18:33.620
to get that fat ass, because we know it's out there.

18:33.620 --> 18:35.060
We know those foods exist.

18:35.060 --> 18:36.100
A lot of legumes.

18:36.660 --> 18:40.260
And then also the exercises that you don't do

18:40.980 --> 18:44.660
and the special way that you sit at the movies that makes your butt cheeks bigger.

18:44.660 --> 18:46.500
I would like to play that game where it's like,

18:46.500 --> 18:52.500
today I didn't do a million squats and I definitely didn't do a thousand sit-ups.

18:52.500 --> 18:52.900
We can-

18:52.900 --> 18:54.180
Oh, good work.

18:54.180 --> 18:55.700
That's a half a point each.

18:55.700 --> 18:57.940
You have a billion points now.

18:57.940 --> 19:02.580
We could somehow work the gyroscope inside the iPhone into the app.

19:02.580 --> 19:04.900
So if it detects that you're moving around, it's like,

19:04.900 --> 19:08.100
chill the fuck out, skinny, skinny person.

19:09.380 --> 19:12.340
And there's like a Siri-like voice that sometimes just comes on and goes,

19:12.340 --> 19:13.780
yeah, have some pizza.

19:14.420 --> 19:14.660
What?

19:15.620 --> 19:17.060
Don't worry about it.

19:17.060 --> 19:18.580
Finish your plate, Daniel.

19:19.220 --> 19:21.700
Daniel, Daniel, it's your fitness enemy.

19:21.700 --> 19:23.860
Finish your plate, Daniel.

19:23.860 --> 19:27.780
It's also got a pedometer function that shocks you every time you take a step.

19:27.780 --> 19:28.260
Yeah.

19:28.260 --> 19:30.500
So with every step-

19:30.500 --> 19:32.260
The electrodes are attached to your butt cheeks.

19:32.260 --> 19:34.740
It's double function because when you zap them,

19:34.740 --> 19:38.020
it tenses and releases and it strengthens and tones.

19:39.380 --> 19:44.660
I bet you that there is also an app out there that vibrates at a certain frequency

19:45.220 --> 19:47.220
that like the creator of the app says,

19:47.220 --> 19:49.140
if you put this on your butt, it'll get bigger.

19:49.140 --> 19:51.460
Or your pee- or your pee-pee or like whatever.

19:51.460 --> 19:52.580
Oh, definitely, yeah.

19:52.580 --> 19:54.180
It's just sending him pictures of your butt.

19:54.180 --> 19:57.540
Mm-hmm, but like super close up.

19:57.540 --> 19:59.460
It would just be a black screen, but they would know.

20:00.100 --> 20:00.660
He knows.

20:00.660 --> 20:01.860
I know exactly what that is.

20:02.900 --> 20:05.540
I believe that's fifth quadrant, if I'm not mistaken.

20:05.540 --> 20:05.780
Why?

20:07.140 --> 20:07.380
Why?

20:08.180 --> 20:11.220
Travis has cut the human butt into butcher-style cuts.

20:11.220 --> 20:14.260
I also want to say that there's someone out there right now listening going,

20:14.260 --> 20:16.180
quadrants are in fours, you asshole.

20:16.740 --> 20:18.180
Hence, fifth quadrant.

20:18.180 --> 20:19.860
Fifth quadrant is the secret tasty part of the butt.

20:19.860 --> 20:24.580
That's the part, you can't get that from the butcher unless you know him real well.

20:24.580 --> 20:28.340
And only then you've got to have already been going there for like two or three years.

20:29.140 --> 20:32.180
You have to have an apple corer and the will to never give up.

20:32.180 --> 20:33.860
And then finally get to the fifth quadrant.

20:33.860 --> 20:35.060
You get to the fifth quadrant.

20:35.060 --> 20:36.180
You eat that piece of butt.

20:37.460 --> 20:40.500
It's like the alien surgery scene in Independence Day.

20:40.500 --> 20:46.100
The problem is it is like the fugu fish where if you get the wrong cut of butt, you're dead.

20:46.100 --> 20:50.980
If you eat even a portion of the fourth quadrant of the butt, kiss it goodbye.

20:52.580 --> 20:53.700
Quite literally.

20:53.700 --> 20:55.140
You will have a butt there.

20:55.140 --> 20:58.660
A portion of the first quadrant, well that's just social suicide.

20:58.660 --> 21:00.180
What are you, a poor person?

21:01.060 --> 21:04.820
Now if you get in that second quadrant, sex.

21:06.740 --> 21:09.860
That as we all know is the athrodisiac quantity of the butt.

21:10.740 --> 21:12.740
No, I meant like that's a butthole.

21:12.740 --> 21:16.420
Okay, good.

21:16.420 --> 21:17.460
Good, wonderful.

21:17.460 --> 21:18.820
Just saying people do that.

21:20.500 --> 21:24.500
Wait, people actually can't technically, like from a physics point of view,

21:24.500 --> 21:26.100
people can't eat buttholes.

21:26.100 --> 21:27.380
It's very, that's why.

21:27.380 --> 21:29.460
They can't eat the absence of thing.

21:29.460 --> 21:30.980
They can't eat the absence of butt.

21:32.260 --> 21:35.380
I guess you ate my butthole.

21:35.380 --> 21:37.700
You can, but you're so hungry after it.

21:37.700 --> 21:39.300
I don't have a hole down there anymore.

21:39.300 --> 21:43.300
It's just a continuum of flesh.

21:43.300 --> 21:46.020
The only thing they can eat buttholes is the langoliers.

21:46.580 --> 21:51.300
Because they can actually, they bend space and time.

21:52.660 --> 21:54.580
You know Alfred Hitchcock doesn't have a belly button.

21:55.620 --> 21:56.180
Is that true?

21:56.740 --> 21:57.700
Yeah, it's true.

21:57.700 --> 21:58.580
That's because he's dead.

21:59.380 --> 22:00.420
Well, okay.

22:00.420 --> 22:01.460
Yeah, okay.

22:01.460 --> 22:03.220
He doesn't have a lot of things anymore.

22:03.220 --> 22:05.620
Okay, but no, yeah, he had surgery when he was a kid

22:05.620 --> 22:08.100
and they sewed up his belly button.

22:08.100 --> 22:09.300
So he didn't have a belly button.

22:09.300 --> 22:12.900
So he's just like a matryoshka doll or whatever it's called.

22:12.900 --> 22:17.540
You can just stack multiple Alfred Hitchcock inside one of them.

22:17.540 --> 22:22.980
Um, man, I bet that they're, I feel like most of the people

22:22.980 --> 22:25.860
that buy apps, and like I buy a shit ton of apps,

22:25.860 --> 22:28.660
but like I just have this feeling that most of the people

22:28.660 --> 22:30.260
that buy apps are dumb.

22:30.260 --> 22:32.660
And so I really do think that this vibration,

22:33.220 --> 22:35.540
we could get like a doctor to sign off on it and be like,

22:35.540 --> 22:39.220
yeah, put that on your dip, on your dipstick,

22:39.220 --> 22:40.580
and it's going to increase in size.

22:40.580 --> 22:42.340
Take it from me, doctor, doctor.

22:44.820 --> 22:49.140
Wait, so we've somehow veered from edible butt parts

22:50.020 --> 22:52.980
to an app that makes your dick bigger?

22:52.980 --> 22:54.820
Or your butt or whatever you put on it.

22:54.820 --> 22:56.260
Maybe you put it on your muscle.

22:56.260 --> 22:57.860
It vibrates it and the doctor says it works.

22:57.860 --> 23:01.460
With that kind of power, what if you like left it on your pinky

23:01.460 --> 23:03.220
for too long and then you got a giant pinky finger.

23:03.220 --> 23:05.700
Oh yeah, oh man, it'd be rough.

23:05.700 --> 23:06.820
It'd be like the end of Akira.

23:06.820 --> 23:08.900
You'd just flood a whole city with your body.

23:10.340 --> 23:12.100
Do you think there's a metal detector app?

23:13.620 --> 23:16.500
See, that's exactly the kind of shit I'm talking about.

23:16.500 --> 23:17.940
Like, point your camera at the ground.

23:17.940 --> 23:19.220
We can tell when there's metal in it.

23:19.220 --> 23:20.820
Like you suit, you wicked can't.

23:21.860 --> 23:22.740
You totally can't.

23:23.940 --> 23:25.300
Okay, there definitely is.

23:26.340 --> 23:28.020
And it says for fun only.

23:28.020 --> 23:29.700
Yeah, okay.

23:29.700 --> 23:32.340
So no business, no business applications?

23:32.340 --> 23:35.300
No business applications for this imaginary metal detector.

23:35.300 --> 23:36.260
Okay, fine.

23:36.260 --> 23:38.020
But I was gonna do science.

23:38.020 --> 23:39.140
Ah, damn it.

23:39.140 --> 23:40.260
Quiet, I'm downloading it.

23:41.300 --> 23:42.980
And you need full focus to do that?

23:43.860 --> 23:45.940
How do you download stuff on your iPhone?

23:45.940 --> 23:47.780
Hold on, I have to stare at it to make it work.

23:47.780 --> 23:49.460
I gotta remember my password.

23:49.460 --> 23:51.300
He hand checks each bit and bite.

23:52.260 --> 23:52.900
Yes, yeah.

23:54.340 --> 23:58.100
I made my password deliberately difficult to remember and enter

23:58.100 --> 24:02.420
to prevent myself from drunk buying any more apps.

24:02.420 --> 24:03.860
I need a metal detector.

24:04.580 --> 24:06.580
An online textbook, $60.

24:07.140 --> 24:07.700
Sure thing.

24:10.260 --> 24:10.900
First review.

24:11.860 --> 24:13.860
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

24:14.980 --> 24:16.740
First review, it is a fake.

24:17.380 --> 24:19.300
It goes by the way you tilt your iPhone.

24:19.940 --> 24:22.180
Second review, works for most metals.

24:24.260 --> 24:25.460
Okay, guys.

24:25.460 --> 24:27.140
That is obviously like a plant.

24:27.140 --> 24:30.420
But if you're gonna get a plant, why is that plant like,

24:30.420 --> 24:32.260
I don't know, it's cobalt, just fine.

24:32.260 --> 24:35.460
But 10, it can't seem to, doesn't seem to grok 10.

24:35.460 --> 24:36.980
But it got cobalt for me, so.

24:37.700 --> 24:38.420
Oh my God.

24:39.460 --> 24:41.220
Here's a great review, delete it.

24:41.860 --> 24:44.980
Does not work on any iPad touch and that is five stars.

24:46.260 --> 24:46.820
Perfect.

24:47.460 --> 24:49.460
It is great in its horribleness.

24:51.940 --> 24:52.500
Oh man.

24:53.300 --> 24:55.700
Let's get another question from one of our beloved readers.

24:55.700 --> 24:57.060
What do you guys say?

24:57.060 --> 24:57.460
No.

24:57.460 --> 25:02.100
I'm a straight lady that happens to be very picky about the guys I date.

25:02.100 --> 25:03.940
So I've been single for a long time.

25:03.940 --> 25:06.580
My bestie, who's significantly less picky,

25:06.580 --> 25:09.620
interpreted my longstanding singleness as asexuality.

25:09.620 --> 25:10.980
Or at least I think she has.

25:11.780 --> 25:14.900
Anytime someone hits on me or I hit on someone around her,

25:14.900 --> 25:17.300
she practically shouts out I'm asexual until they go away.

25:18.020 --> 25:21.540
She expects me to thank her for saving me from them.

25:21.540 --> 25:24.740
She also makes jokes about how asexual I am constantly.

25:24.740 --> 25:28.180
I don't want her shoving guys in my face, but this is out of control.

25:28.180 --> 25:30.660
How can I explain to her that I'm not asexual

25:30.660 --> 25:33.060
without her thinking I'm hiding in the closet?

25:33.060 --> 25:34.500
That's from Persnickety in Ohio.

25:36.180 --> 25:37.860
Why don't you just say it?

25:37.860 --> 25:40.260
Why don't you just say get the fuck?

25:40.980 --> 25:44.580
What the fuck are you doing there misery?

25:44.580 --> 25:46.340
Because you're fucking creeping me out.

25:47.060 --> 25:49.060
Hey Sharon, maybe don't bring it up.

25:49.860 --> 25:51.700
You can feel that way all you want to,

25:51.700 --> 25:56.340
but maybe that's not the opening line when you see me talking to a fella.

25:56.340 --> 25:59.460
Hey, maybe like you've had kind of a cold streak

25:59.460 --> 26:02.260
because your friend Sharon tells everybody you're asexual.

26:02.260 --> 26:04.740
Yeah, you dug that your vagina grew over.

26:04.740 --> 26:06.100
Maybe that's the issue.

26:06.820 --> 26:10.500
I'm not like a relationship scientist or anything, but that seems probable.

26:10.500 --> 26:14.260
I will also say that it's kind of offensive that there's a population,

26:14.820 --> 26:19.780
the segment of the population that is actually living with asexuality.

26:19.780 --> 26:20.980
This is like a group of people.

26:20.980 --> 26:21.860
It's not like a goof.

26:21.860 --> 26:24.420
There's like actual asexual people.

26:24.420 --> 26:26.420
Yeah, it's not like a cool thing for you to be like,

26:26.420 --> 26:27.540
oh, she doesn't sleep with anyone.

26:27.540 --> 26:28.900
She's totally asexual.

26:28.900 --> 26:30.660
That's like an actual thing.

26:30.660 --> 26:31.460
Hey dog.

26:31.460 --> 26:34.340
You know, they've got their own struggles trying to get accepted in society

26:34.340 --> 26:38.980
without your friend Sharon trying to pussy block you at every turn.

26:38.980 --> 26:39.300
Yeah.

26:39.860 --> 26:40.260
I'm sorry.

26:40.260 --> 26:43.460
Is that like the acceptable thing for cock blocking?

26:43.460 --> 26:45.940
I could come up with way worse terms.

26:46.900 --> 26:48.340
I know you could.

26:48.340 --> 26:50.260
No, I want to hear like three of them.

26:50.260 --> 26:50.760
Oh God.

26:51.860 --> 26:52.500
Lip zipping.

26:53.700 --> 26:56.260
No, I don't want to hear half of one.

26:56.260 --> 26:59.220
Ladies and gentlemen, Travis Patrick McElroy.

26:59.220 --> 26:59.940
Thank you very much.

26:59.940 --> 27:00.100
Thank you.

27:00.100 --> 27:01.620
Oh no, they can find a social now.

27:02.420 --> 27:03.700
Social, social.

27:04.500 --> 27:05.460
Oh, that's rough.

27:05.460 --> 27:06.900
This is so fucking sta-

27:07.940 --> 27:11.140
This seems like this isn't even to me a conundrum.

27:11.140 --> 27:13.140
Just say the fucking shit and be like,

27:13.140 --> 27:15.540
hey, I need you to cut that shit out.

27:15.540 --> 27:15.860
Yeah.

27:15.860 --> 27:18.580
Not only is it not cool,

27:18.580 --> 27:21.620
but it's also making me less likely to find someone

27:21.620 --> 27:23.940
that I actually meets my high standards.

27:24.500 --> 27:25.140
You know what I mean?

27:25.140 --> 27:29.540
Like, your friend is unless.

27:29.540 --> 27:30.340
Unless.

27:30.340 --> 27:31.380
Oh, I know what you're thinking.

27:31.380 --> 27:33.060
She's trying to Mulholland drive you.

27:33.060 --> 27:33.860
Oh no.

27:34.900 --> 27:36.100
That's probably not true though.

27:36.740 --> 27:39.220
Well, there's also the possibility that you,

27:40.020 --> 27:41.060
okay, this is awful,

27:41.060 --> 27:48.500
but I'm going to tell you that maybe you are unconsciously wing manning Sharon.

27:48.500 --> 27:48.980
Wait a minute.

27:48.980 --> 27:49.540
What?

27:49.540 --> 27:51.780
You're going out to these bars together.

27:51.780 --> 27:52.100
Shit.

27:52.100 --> 27:52.500
Okay.

27:52.500 --> 27:55.700
So, no, this one pretty much doesn't even have a vagina.

27:55.700 --> 27:57.060
I'm Sharon, by the way.

27:57.060 --> 27:58.500
This is what, oh man.

27:59.140 --> 28:03.300
I'm just saying that Sharon may enjoy having someone

28:03.300 --> 28:05.300
that is not on the pursuit.

28:05.300 --> 28:07.620
They're just talking her up and making her look good.

28:07.620 --> 28:11.220
So you're getting the guys all heated up, right?

28:11.220 --> 28:13.620
Sharon is poaching.

28:13.620 --> 28:17.220
Oh my God, you're right.

28:17.220 --> 28:23.700
I'm just saying, like, she likes you as her partner in crime going out on the town

28:23.700 --> 28:25.300
because you're not a threat to her game.

28:26.740 --> 28:28.100
That all makes perfect sense to me.

28:28.100 --> 28:28.900
It does it though.

28:29.700 --> 28:33.380
But I'm upset that maybe we've been doing this show for too long as a result.

28:34.100 --> 28:35.300
Should that make sense?

28:35.300 --> 28:37.220
Now we have to ask a question.

28:37.220 --> 28:38.500
It totally makes sense.

28:38.500 --> 28:39.540
Yeah, okay.

28:40.340 --> 28:42.580
Yeah, it's because everyone in the world is devious.

28:43.460 --> 28:44.660
Everybody's got secrets.

28:44.660 --> 28:45.140
Well, I'm okay.

28:45.140 --> 28:47.700
Okay, everybody does have secret.

28:47.700 --> 28:50.180
I mean, like, she probably just thinks, okay.

28:51.300 --> 28:55.780
We are all so sort of lost with how to behave in public

28:55.780 --> 29:01.460
that I think that there's part of us that likes having like a bit, you know, that you can do.

29:01.460 --> 29:04.980
Like a routine, something that's comfortable where you kind of like,

29:04.980 --> 29:06.260
oh yeah, that's kind of our bit.

29:06.260 --> 29:12.180
So when we go out, our bit is I, you know, I pretend she's asexual and she's not.

29:12.180 --> 29:16.020
I don't actually know what the conclusion of the bit is, but...

29:17.220 --> 29:20.740
The person fucks the guy that this girl was trying to hook up with.

29:20.740 --> 29:21.940
That's the conclusion.

29:21.940 --> 29:23.460
That's how it shakes out, right?

29:24.020 --> 29:24.900
Yeah, I don't know.

29:24.900 --> 29:27.300
I think it just sucks no matter what.

29:28.820 --> 29:33.940
Even if she thinks she's being harmless, like it's still kind of a bitchy thing to do.

29:33.940 --> 29:36.900
It is, it sucks.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.340
Yeah, I think you just need to...

29:38.340 --> 29:45.700
Unless, unless she's trying to set you up as like, can't fuck this.

29:46.260 --> 29:47.220
You know what I mean?

29:47.220 --> 29:50.980
Oh, she's putting her on a pedestal preemptively.

29:50.980 --> 29:53.300
This is what I'm saying.

29:54.580 --> 29:57.620
It's not what I'm saying though, cause it's the dumbest.

29:57.620 --> 29:58.580
Let's just say it.

29:58.580 --> 29:59.300
Get it out there.

29:59.300 --> 30:05.300
I, if you say that this person doesn't have sexual, then the person, if the person is

30:05.300 --> 30:10.980
the right kind of person, or by which I mean the wrongest person ever, they might say,

30:10.980 --> 30:13.540
well, I can get some sexual in there.

30:13.540 --> 30:13.940
I bet.

30:13.940 --> 30:14.500
Let me see.

30:14.500 --> 30:15.060
I bet I can.

30:15.620 --> 30:19.620
Let me, you haven't seen what I do in there up and around it.

30:19.620 --> 30:20.900
Let me find out.

30:20.900 --> 30:23.060
Maybe you're just Dansexual and hold on.

30:24.100 --> 30:25.940
Let Dan find out what's going on in there.

30:25.940 --> 30:29.540
Maybe this whole time you've been Dansexual.

30:29.540 --> 30:30.740
Might I suggest Dan?

30:30.740 --> 30:32.660
Hey, don't be Danphobic.

30:32.660 --> 30:32.980
This is...

30:36.420 --> 30:38.580
Let me break you off some Dan, just real quick.

30:39.380 --> 30:40.660
Just the taste of the flavor.

30:41.780 --> 30:48.180
You know what they say, once you go Dan, hey, did you try the flan?

30:50.260 --> 30:52.820
Cause Dan makes flan for you after he makes love to you.

30:52.820 --> 30:54.820
Dan's the flan man, don't even worry about it.

30:54.820 --> 30:56.260
That's basically Dan's calling card.

30:57.940 --> 31:00.580
If you smell flan, you know Dan's been fucking.

31:00.580 --> 31:02.420
Do you want to fuck Dan and eat some flan?

31:02.420 --> 31:02.980
Oh, what's that?

31:02.980 --> 31:04.020
You don't like flan?

31:04.020 --> 31:04.740
I understand.

31:06.180 --> 31:08.180
The weirdest Dr. Seuss book ever.

31:10.980 --> 31:13.300
Dan the man with the flan plan, fucking.

31:16.340 --> 31:21.540
Dan's about two things, fucking and eating flan and we're all out of flan.

31:21.540 --> 31:26.420
On his deathbed, Dr. Seuss handed that book to his publisher, like, wait till you-

31:26.420 --> 31:31.060
Dr. Seuss is like, listen, I know, I know I told you that I didn't have any more books.

31:31.060 --> 31:33.860
I said I was out the game, but wait till you hear my new shit.

31:34.420 --> 31:39.460
I know I've been battling with mild dementia, but I believe this is my magnum opus.

31:40.020 --> 31:41.220
That bitch is fine.

31:41.220 --> 31:42.180
Let me know what you think.

31:42.740 --> 31:44.340
It's like that scene in Proof.

31:45.540 --> 31:46.740
It's from the notebook.

31:46.740 --> 31:49.220
This is just pictures of a guy fucking some flan.

31:49.220 --> 31:52.180
He had so many characters, Dan the flan fucking man.

31:52.980 --> 31:54.100
What do you think?

31:54.100 --> 31:56.100
What do you think, Seuss Incorporated?

31:56.100 --> 31:57.060
Can I get another hit?

31:57.780 --> 31:58.020
No.

31:58.900 --> 32:01.380
We are already building the ride at Universal.

32:02.500 --> 32:06.020
We're about to edit this more than the original story for Hop on Pop.

32:09.700 --> 32:11.220
You're on fire today.

32:11.220 --> 32:11.700
I know.

32:12.500 --> 32:13.380
Absolutely.

32:13.380 --> 32:14.820
Just keep passing him the rock.

32:14.820 --> 32:17.620
Speaking of fucking flan, do you guys want to go to the Money Zone?

32:17.620 --> 32:18.580
That's who I am.

32:29.620 --> 32:31.860
We got a message from Marissa Yoko Hankins.

32:33.380 --> 32:37.060
Either that's her actual name or she told her group of friends.

32:37.860 --> 32:38.980
We'll probably never know the truth.

32:38.980 --> 32:40.420
Now she's OG.

32:40.420 --> 32:42.180
I recognize that Twitter tag.

32:42.180 --> 32:47.220
Cassie Rosenbrock is who this message is from and she says, happy 26, Marissa.

32:47.220 --> 32:48.660
She's hilarious and kind.

32:48.660 --> 32:52.180
She works with nuns and she doesn't even use swears around them.

32:52.180 --> 32:53.940
She has a complicated dog named Tofu.

32:53.940 --> 32:58.180
She's converted everyone she knows to an NBNBAM fan, presumably not the nuns.

32:59.780 --> 33:01.540
Well, yes, I don't see anything wrong with this.

33:02.980 --> 33:07.220
And she deserves the best NBNBAM wish money can buy.

33:07.220 --> 33:09.060
So happy birthday.

33:09.060 --> 33:10.740
Happy birthday, Marissa.

33:10.740 --> 33:13.060
Happy birthday, here's your flan.

33:15.300 --> 33:18.020
I hope you have a crab-solutely wonderful birthday.

33:18.020 --> 33:18.900
No, no.

33:19.460 --> 33:20.660
Trav, hit me with this new one.

33:20.660 --> 33:22.420
Hey, do you guys like iPhone games?

33:22.420 --> 33:23.140
Yeah.

33:23.140 --> 33:23.940
How about Bowt?

33:25.460 --> 33:26.100
Tell me about it.

33:26.100 --> 33:27.140
It sounds cool.

33:27.140 --> 33:28.340
Wait, wait, hold on.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.220
Tell me Bowt it.

33:29.780 --> 33:30.820
I'll tell you Bowt Bowt.

33:31.460 --> 33:33.700
Bowt is a photo taking game you play with friends.

33:33.700 --> 33:36.180
It's made by Awkward Hug and College Humor.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.940
So that's pretty awesome right there.

33:37.940 --> 33:41.380
And Awkward Hug are huge My Brother, My Brother, and Me fans.

33:42.260 --> 33:44.580
I wrote a post about this game the other day.

33:44.580 --> 33:47.380
I had no idea that they were part of the-

33:47.380 --> 33:48.580
Oh, shit.

33:48.580 --> 33:49.380
Cross Pro.

33:49.380 --> 33:49.780
I know.

33:49.780 --> 33:53.540
The NBNBAM Illuminati group.

33:53.540 --> 33:54.260
I don't know.

33:54.260 --> 33:54.980
Skulls and Bonin.

33:54.980 --> 33:56.820
What do we call our secret fans?

33:56.820 --> 33:57.140
Like our fans-

33:57.140 --> 33:58.900
I said Skulls and Bonin.

33:58.900 --> 33:59.940
Okay, Skulls and Bonin.

33:59.940 --> 34:02.020
The Illuma- The Illuma-naughty.

34:02.660 --> 34:06.500
So in Bowt, I'll explain the rules because they just didn't do it.

34:06.500 --> 34:08.260
But luckily, I have that knowledge.

34:08.900 --> 34:12.020
By the way, maybe you should hire some marketing PR because

34:13.300 --> 34:16.500
you obviously don't know how to write promotional spots on comedy podcasts.

34:18.660 --> 34:21.460
You set up a category like do your best Spider-Man

34:22.020 --> 34:26.420
and then all your friends take pictures of themselves doing the best Spider-Man

34:26.420 --> 34:28.500
and then the judge votes on the best picture.

34:29.620 --> 34:30.820
That's such a good idea.

34:30.820 --> 34:31.060
Yeah.

34:31.060 --> 34:31.540
I like that a lot.

34:31.540 --> 34:32.180
It's fun.

34:32.180 --> 34:34.020
So it's just B-O-U-T?

34:34.820 --> 34:35.300
Check it out.

34:35.300 --> 34:36.420
Get it on the iTunes store.

34:36.420 --> 34:36.740
Yeah.

34:36.740 --> 34:37.060
I'm gonna-

34:38.020 --> 34:39.060
You're gonna be bad about it.

34:41.300 --> 34:44.420
This next one, I'm gonna say I'm very excited about.

34:45.060 --> 34:45.780
Oh, hit me, Trav.

34:45.780 --> 34:46.180
I'm ready.

34:47.700 --> 34:52.660
You need to visit corndogday.com and order your party pack.

34:53.300 --> 34:56.100
Click on party pack button and get it.

34:56.100 --> 34:58.100
Seriously, get it.

34:58.100 --> 35:00.100
Happy National Corn Dog Day, everybody.

35:01.220 --> 35:03.300
National Corn Dog Day is March 23rd.

35:03.300 --> 35:04.020
What's that?

35:04.020 --> 35:05.540
It's a day to gather friends,

35:05.540 --> 35:07.220
watch the college basketball tournament,

35:07.220 --> 35:09.460
and eat fucking corndogs.

35:09.460 --> 35:11.780
Lots and lots of corndogs.

35:11.780 --> 35:13.380
Forget feats of strength.

35:13.380 --> 35:14.900
Try the triple double.

35:14.900 --> 35:17.860
Ten corndogs, ten beer, and eight hun-

35:17.860 --> 35:18.900
No, sorry.

35:18.900 --> 35:21.140
And a hundred tater tots.

35:21.140 --> 35:21.640
Four.

35:23.220 --> 35:24.260
I heard everything.

35:24.260 --> 35:27.540
Susan, it happened again.

35:28.820 --> 35:30.820
God damn this holiday.

35:31.780 --> 35:34.420
Ten corndogs, ten beers, a hundred tater tots,

35:34.420 --> 35:35.940
in a single afternoon.

35:35.940 --> 35:36.980
Many have tried.

35:36.980 --> 35:38.180
Few have achieved.

35:38.180 --> 35:41.380
Ramp up the ultimate celebration on meat on sticks

35:41.380 --> 35:43.700
by ordering a corndog day party pack.

35:43.700 --> 35:46.900
The party pack have coupons for free boxes of corndogs,

35:46.900 --> 35:49.540
posters, t-shirts, and other fun stuff.

35:49.540 --> 35:51.940
So go to corndogday.com and get it.

35:51.940 --> 35:53.940
What the fuck, you guys?

35:54.660 --> 35:55.620
Isn't that awesome?

35:55.620 --> 35:57.060
It's- but it doesn't make-

35:57.060 --> 35:59.060
I get like the national dairy farmers

35:59.060 --> 36:01.060
like doing commercials for milk and shit,

36:01.060 --> 36:03.780
but like corndog seems pretty esoteric

36:03.780 --> 36:04.500
to have its own-

36:04.500 --> 36:05.700
Brought to you by the council for corndogs.

36:05.700 --> 36:06.180
I guess.

36:07.300 --> 36:08.900
I mean, man, I haven't eaten a corndog

36:08.900 --> 36:10.580
in a fucking grip though.

36:10.580 --> 36:10.980
I know.

36:10.980 --> 36:11.860
Oh, man.

36:11.860 --> 36:13.380
I want one really bad now.

36:13.380 --> 36:14.660
Yeah, like when you-

36:14.660 --> 36:15.780
corndogs are one of those things

36:15.780 --> 36:18.340
where if you don't think about them a lot,

36:18.340 --> 36:19.540
well, you're like most people,

36:19.540 --> 36:20.500
but when you do think about them,

36:20.500 --> 36:22.260
sometimes you just get fixated.

36:22.260 --> 36:24.980
Yeah, it's like when you hear hooves

36:24.980 --> 36:27.860
and you think zebra, then you're-

36:27.860 --> 36:29.060
You wanna eat a zebra dog.

36:29.060 --> 36:30.500
You're legally insane.

36:30.500 --> 36:32.900
Look at this art on the front page of corndog day

36:32.900 --> 36:34.740
that I just put in the Skype window, guys.

36:34.740 --> 36:38.420
It's like giant, this brawny woodman

36:38.420 --> 36:41.860
is airlifting giant corndogs into a truck.

36:41.860 --> 36:45.780
And now all I can think about is eating a corndog.

36:45.780 --> 36:46.740
They'll kill you in a day,

36:47.380 --> 36:50.420
but now I want 10 corndogs,

36:50.420 --> 36:53.300
10 beers and 800 datadogs.

36:53.300 --> 36:55.460
So we hear you wanna make your butt bigger.

36:56.740 --> 36:58.420
Well, we've got a recipe for you.

36:58.420 --> 37:01.620
It's the Ass Stopper XXL Butt Plug

37:01.620 --> 37:04.260
brought to you by ExtremeRestraints.com.

37:04.260 --> 37:08.500
Now for just $55, we're gonna get you into a butt plug.

37:08.500 --> 37:09.300
Well, no, sorry.

37:09.300 --> 37:11.380
We're gonna get a butt plug in you.

37:11.380 --> 37:14.020
What's it gonna take for me to get this butt plug in you?

37:14.020 --> 37:15.220
Mom, dark it down.

37:15.220 --> 37:18.420
Before you leave our storeroom floor today,

37:18.420 --> 37:20.260
I wanna put this butt plug in you.

37:20.260 --> 37:22.420
Now let me give you guys some perspective here

37:22.420 --> 37:25.220
because I feel like as we mature,

37:25.220 --> 37:27.620
that is the most valuable thing we glean.

37:28.260 --> 37:31.060
The Ass Stopper is a super huge butt plug.

37:31.060 --> 37:34.020
Now this is from the experts.

37:34.020 --> 37:34.900
That's its gauge.

37:34.900 --> 37:36.580
That's its official gauge, right?

37:36.580 --> 37:37.220
That's its gauge.

37:37.220 --> 37:39.700
That's from the experts at ExtremeRestraints.com.

37:40.660 --> 37:42.180
It's a super huge butt plug

37:43.540 --> 37:45.220
and it stands about nine inches high

37:45.220 --> 37:47.540
and its widest point is five inches wide.

37:47.540 --> 37:48.500
Justin, no kidding.

37:49.220 --> 37:50.420
This thing is enormous.

37:50.420 --> 37:51.620
This thing looks like a...

37:51.620 --> 37:52.580
I'm looking at it

37:52.580 --> 37:55.460
and there's an unshirted gentleman holding it

37:55.460 --> 37:58.100
and he looks like he's accepting a CableAce award.

37:58.100 --> 38:01.620
It is a massive...

38:01.620 --> 38:02.900
He looks tired.

38:02.900 --> 38:05.460
He looks like he's suffering back problems from...

38:05.460 --> 38:07.860
You see his tendons straining under the weight

38:07.860 --> 38:09.540
of this three pound butt plug

38:09.540 --> 38:13.300
and yes, I did say three pounds of filling pleasure.

38:13.300 --> 38:16.580
That of course is not all that ExtremeRestraints.com has to offer.

38:17.300 --> 38:19.460
It's got lots of things you can purchase

38:28.260 --> 38:29.380
Oh, it's got...

38:29.380 --> 38:31.380
If you're not supposed to show it in public,

38:31.380 --> 38:33.460
ExtremeRestraints has got something to stick in it

38:33.460 --> 38:34.420
or stick it in

38:35.060 --> 38:38.020

38:42.660 --> 38:45.540
which have feature length free videos

38:45.540 --> 38:47.300
about how to fuck dirty.

38:47.300 --> 38:50.100
So if you wanna do it raw and real...

38:50.100 --> 38:52.020
Have you been searching all over the internet

38:52.020 --> 38:53.780
for videos of people having sex

38:53.780 --> 38:55.460
but just haven't been able to find them?

38:55.460 --> 38:55.940
Don't worry.

38:57.860 --> 39:00.180
There's a whole video about dominant diva.

39:00.180 --> 39:02.260
There's one about male chastity.

39:02.260 --> 39:04.740
There's one which actually I think I saw that

39:04.740 --> 39:07.780
in church camp once, that male chastity video.

39:07.780 --> 39:09.700
I think we signed a pledge and got some rings

39:09.700 --> 39:10.740
if I remember correctly.

39:10.740 --> 39:12.580
Right, but the ring wasn't a tiny cage

39:12.580 --> 39:14.740
that you put around your penis with a sign on it.

39:14.740 --> 39:15.460
It says bad.

39:16.500 --> 39:17.860
It might've been, I didn't look.

39:17.860 --> 39:19.700
ExtremeRestraints.com is the website.

39:24.100 --> 39:25.780
Good luck not jerking off.

39:26.420 --> 39:27.060
Next question.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.700
Friends are constantly telling me

39:29.700 --> 39:31.140
I should move away from Oklahoma

39:31.140 --> 39:32.820
cause there's nothing here for me.

39:32.820 --> 39:34.420
I understand there's a lot to do

39:34.420 --> 39:35.940
and experience in other parts of the country

39:35.940 --> 39:37.460
but I spent my whole life here.

39:37.460 --> 39:38.980
Currently planning on going back to school

39:38.980 --> 39:41.700
getting a master's in education, teaching English

39:41.700 --> 39:42.740
which would give me plenty of time

39:42.740 --> 39:43.940
during the summer, winter, spring breaks

39:43.940 --> 39:45.380
to travel and see the better states.

39:46.260 --> 39:47.540
That's better in quotes by the way.

39:48.260 --> 39:51.220
Will I regret not moving out of okay

39:51.220 --> 39:52.340
and seeing what else is out there?

39:52.340 --> 39:53.060
Additional details.

39:53.060 --> 39:54.020
I'm a musician.

39:54.020 --> 39:55.300
People tell me I'll never have the chance

39:55.300 --> 39:56.340
to blow up if I stay here

39:56.340 --> 39:58.740
but I think I get to play plenty.

39:58.740 --> 40:01.620
Are people just projecting their ambitions on me?

40:01.620 --> 40:03.620
That's from OK Oklahoma.

40:03.620 --> 40:05.620
Man, this is gonna get real.

40:06.340 --> 40:08.580
Yeah, they are projecting their ambitions onto you

40:08.580 --> 40:10.900
which is what we are about to do also.

40:12.020 --> 40:13.540
Brace your ears.

40:13.540 --> 40:14.340
Maybe.

40:14.340 --> 40:16.420
Travis, give us some perspective on Oklahoma first.

40:16.420 --> 40:18.820
I'm gonna say this because having been from,

40:18.820 --> 40:20.980
lived in both Oklahoma and West Virginia

40:20.980 --> 40:23.940
two of the most shatter upon states in the union.

40:24.820 --> 40:28.020
I think that my take on it is that

40:28.900 --> 40:31.700
every state is more or less the same.

40:31.700 --> 40:34.100
If you discount California and New York

40:34.820 --> 40:36.340
every state is just about the same.

40:36.340 --> 40:39.540
They have big cities like two or three,

40:39.540 --> 40:41.940
you know, maybe more big cities

40:41.940 --> 40:44.100
and then lots of open space in between.

40:45.300 --> 40:45.940
You know what I mean?

40:45.940 --> 40:49.060
Like I look at Ohio and it's got, you know

40:49.060 --> 40:50.980
Columbus and Cincinnati and Cleveland

40:50.980 --> 40:52.420
which are huge cities.

40:52.420 --> 40:54.100
If you drive like 10 minutes

40:54.100 --> 40:56.180
or they're relatively large cities.

40:56.180 --> 40:58.580
If you drive 10 minutes outside of Cincinnati

40:58.580 --> 40:59.620
there ain't nothing.

40:59.620 --> 41:01.060
Yeah, it's a fart hole.

41:01.620 --> 41:03.860
I mean, it's the same driving into Chicago and Illinois.

41:03.860 --> 41:05.780
You know, you drive from Cincinnati to there.

41:05.780 --> 41:07.300
You hit Chicago, it's gigantic

41:07.300 --> 41:11.140
but like 20 miles outside of Chicago, it's farmland.

41:11.140 --> 41:15.060
Yeah, but I think what's more important

41:15.060 --> 41:17.700
than just Oklahoma.

41:17.700 --> 41:19.540
I think that the point of,

41:20.900 --> 41:23.060
if you are, if you are, here's what I'll say.

41:23.700 --> 41:27.460
If you are having any doubts at all about it

41:27.460 --> 41:30.820
you definitely, definitely need to look around.

41:31.700 --> 41:34.660
Like you definitely need to do a tour

41:34.660 --> 41:35.460
like you're planning on.

41:35.460 --> 41:36.980
Cause like you really won't know

41:37.620 --> 41:39.380
what is best for you out there

41:39.380 --> 41:42.180
until you, until you look

41:42.180 --> 41:44.580
like that's the only way that you can check it out

41:44.580 --> 41:45.620
and look in earnest.

41:46.340 --> 41:47.460
I think it's a great point, Griffin.

41:47.460 --> 41:52.340
I think you can, you can get conditioned to one area

41:52.900 --> 41:55.060
and think that other areas are,

41:56.100 --> 41:57.300
they become more foreign to you

41:57.300 --> 41:59.220
and that you think, well, I could never be at home there.

42:00.260 --> 42:02.100
So I would heartily recommend,

42:02.100 --> 42:03.780
I mean, like obviously I've decided to,

42:03.780 --> 42:06.580
to settle here in West Virginia.

42:06.580 --> 42:08.020
I've been all over.

42:08.020 --> 42:10.500
I mean, I've been to most of the major American cities

42:11.460 --> 42:13.460
and I've, I've checked it out.

42:13.460 --> 42:14.580
I've seen what's going on

42:14.580 --> 42:18.020
and I've, I've, you know, I've always wanted to come back here.

42:18.020 --> 42:19.940
You got, you got scared by all the cars.

42:19.940 --> 42:24.020
It's like, what are the, what are these Triceratops?

42:24.020 --> 42:24.660
Like, I don't know.

42:25.460 --> 42:26.820
What are these fire breathing?

42:26.820 --> 42:27.620
I don't know.

42:27.620 --> 42:30.100
The thing is, is like, I think the important thing

42:30.100 --> 42:33.220
to keep in mind is end up where the best,

42:33.940 --> 42:37.220
like the best setting for what you want to do.

42:37.220 --> 42:37.700
You know what I mean?

42:37.700 --> 42:39.780
So for example, if you want to teach,

42:40.500 --> 42:42.340
you know, college English,

42:42.340 --> 42:45.300
make sure you settle down near a college

42:45.300 --> 42:46.900
that has a good English department.

42:46.900 --> 42:48.340
And not in Chicago,

42:48.340 --> 42:50.900
because it's very hard to get a teaching job there.

42:50.900 --> 42:53.220
Yeah, but if you want to do music,

42:53.220 --> 42:54.900
if you want to go the music route,

42:54.900 --> 42:56.500
then yeah, you probably don't want to end up

42:56.500 --> 42:57.540
in Norman, Oklahoma.

42:57.540 --> 42:58.100
Yeah.

42:58.100 --> 43:00.340
That said, that said, like, you know,

43:00.340 --> 43:03.780
I know lots of people that they live in smaller towns

43:03.780 --> 43:07.060
and they play at bars and they play music festivals.

43:07.060 --> 43:09.140
And maybe that's like fun for you.

43:09.140 --> 43:10.980
Like you can just, I mean, yeah,

43:10.980 --> 43:12.820
you're not going to blow up. Like, do you want to?

43:12.820 --> 43:14.340
That seems really hard.

43:14.340 --> 43:17.620
It seems really hard to be like a big, gigantic rock star.

43:17.620 --> 43:19.140
It seems like the odds are probably,

43:19.140 --> 43:20.820
see that, that is my only problem

43:20.820 --> 43:22.980
with people moving to giant cities,

43:22.980 --> 43:28.180
banking, like a huge, a very unlikely career on them.

43:28.180 --> 43:30.020
You know, like if you want to,

43:30.020 --> 43:31.620
first off with the internet,

43:31.620 --> 43:35.780
now you can have a music career outside of New York,

43:35.780 --> 43:36.660
LA, Chicago.

43:36.660 --> 43:39.460
I mean, you can sell music direct to people

43:39.460 --> 43:41.940
and build a following that way.

43:41.940 --> 43:44.500
And yeah, I mean, eventually you'll probably need to tour

43:44.500 --> 43:45.860
if you start to catch on.

43:45.860 --> 43:49.140
But like, you look at a musician like Jonathan Colton,

43:49.140 --> 43:52.100
he built his following completely online

43:52.100 --> 43:53.140
before he ever started.

43:53.140 --> 43:54.660
Well, that's what Brent did.

43:54.660 --> 43:55.220
Sure, yeah.

43:55.220 --> 43:56.100
Yeah, that's what Brent did.

43:56.100 --> 43:57.380
Well, he started on YouTube

43:57.380 --> 44:00.820
and now he very rarely actually performs in New York.

44:00.820 --> 44:03.780
He travels to conferences and does all that.

44:03.780 --> 44:06.180
You know, I reminded my friend Maggie,

44:06.180 --> 44:07.940
her dad is a standup comic.

44:07.940 --> 44:10.420
He started when he was like 30, 35, kind of late,

44:10.420 --> 44:11.140
a little bit late.

44:11.700 --> 44:15.860
And he makes his living entirely off of doing standup comedy

44:15.860 --> 44:17.540
and he just tours, you know?

44:17.540 --> 44:19.460
He'll stop and play a week somewhere

44:19.460 --> 44:21.620
and then go home and, you know, be home for a while

44:21.620 --> 44:23.060
and that's how he makes his living.

44:23.060 --> 44:25.620
And he, you know, lives in Oklahoma

44:26.340 --> 44:28.100
and, you know, you just tour to other places.

44:28.100 --> 44:30.580
He's got kids all up and down 66, I bet.

44:31.620 --> 44:34.100
I'm saying your friend's dad is an adulterer.

44:34.100 --> 44:36.020
No, no, I picked that up after I agreed with it.

44:36.020 --> 44:36.820
Now I feel awful.

44:36.820 --> 44:37.540
Yeah.

44:37.540 --> 44:39.060
But it's one of those things where,

44:39.060 --> 44:40.580
like, you make your own scenario, dude.

44:40.580 --> 44:41.460
You know what I mean?

44:41.460 --> 44:44.340
So if you want to stay in Oklahoma and do other things,

44:44.340 --> 44:45.060
do it, you know?

44:45.620 --> 44:47.860
But that said, there are better environments

44:47.860 --> 44:49.060
for certain things.

44:49.060 --> 44:51.140
Like, if you want to work in the film industry,

44:51.140 --> 44:55.140
yeah, you probably shouldn't stay, you know, in Oklahoma.

44:55.140 --> 44:56.900
It's so hard to be happy.

44:56.900 --> 44:57.460
It is.

44:57.460 --> 44:59.700
And if you're happy in Oklahoma,

44:59.700 --> 45:02.260
like, fucking ride that comet, little prince.

45:02.260 --> 45:05.460
It couldn't be, like, that couldn't be,

45:05.460 --> 45:07.060
that's the most important thing.

45:07.060 --> 45:08.500
And it seems like such an obvious thing,

45:08.500 --> 45:14.340
but I had so many friends that left college or high school

45:14.900 --> 45:17.620
and said, like, I'm just going to move to this place

45:17.620 --> 45:21.140
because, you know, I think I could find a job there

45:21.140 --> 45:22.820
and be very successful.

45:22.820 --> 45:25.060
And none of them were especially happy.

45:26.340 --> 45:27.060
I don't know.

45:27.060 --> 45:30.180
That's why I kept moving around after I graduated

45:30.180 --> 45:32.900
because, I don't know, I just couldn't,

45:32.900 --> 45:35.380
I wasn't as happy as I am now in Austin.

45:35.380 --> 45:37.700
And I, like, I knew that it was out there.

45:37.700 --> 45:41.380
I just, it wasn't for me in Huntington or Cincinnati

45:41.380 --> 45:42.180
or Chicago.

45:42.180 --> 45:44.340
Like, I had to come here to find it.

45:44.340 --> 45:46.100
You know, Teresa and I have had a lot of discussions

45:46.100 --> 45:48.180
about this and I apologize to our listeners

45:48.180 --> 45:49.780
because, like, none of this is really funny.

45:49.780 --> 45:52.740
But Teresa and I had a conversation about this

45:52.740 --> 45:53.460
very early on.

45:53.460 --> 45:55.380
And the idea is, like, the thing to keep in mind is

45:56.100 --> 45:58.820
places don't make you happy.

45:58.820 --> 45:59.060
No.

45:59.700 --> 46:02.420
Like, you got to be happy in the place.

46:02.420 --> 46:04.580
The place can have shit that makes you happy.

46:04.580 --> 46:08.340
But, ultimately, humans, like, we don't need that much shit.

46:08.340 --> 46:12.420
Like, I need a few nice restaurants

46:12.420 --> 46:16.500
and a bar that I can go to that doesn't give me the creepos

46:16.500 --> 46:19.940
and a movie theater where all the people don't talk.

46:19.940 --> 46:22.100
And, literally, if I have all that shit

46:22.100 --> 46:23.620
and I'm basically set.

46:24.260 --> 46:26.420
Even if you talk to people who are in New York,

46:26.420 --> 46:28.260
you know, you ask them about, you know,

46:30.180 --> 46:32.260
what's your favorite Thai place?

46:32.260 --> 46:35.300
Well, there is the Thai place that is within two blocks of me.

46:35.300 --> 46:35.620
Right.

46:35.620 --> 46:36.980
And you'll ask about someplace else.

46:36.980 --> 46:37.300
I don't know.

46:37.300 --> 46:38.260
That's three blocks away.

46:38.260 --> 46:39.380
How can I know where that is?

46:39.380 --> 46:39.780
I don't know.

46:39.780 --> 46:40.820
What am I, a millionaire?

46:40.820 --> 46:41.540
I can't travel.

46:42.580 --> 46:44.260
You know, it's just like, you know,

46:44.260 --> 46:45.620
find a place that makes you happy.

46:45.620 --> 46:47.780
Now, if Oklahoma makes you happy, then, yeah,

46:47.780 --> 46:48.580
don't worry about it, dude.

46:48.580 --> 46:51.860
But if you find yourself, like, sighing out the window,

46:51.860 --> 46:53.060
then, yeah, maybe go explore.

46:53.060 --> 46:53.380
We're not.

46:53.380 --> 46:54.260
Go rambling.

46:54.260 --> 46:56.340
I don't mean to make it sound like we're shitting on New York.

46:57.140 --> 46:58.100
It's just like, I don't know.

46:58.100 --> 47:01.540
I think that it really does come down to the type of person

47:01.540 --> 47:02.420
you are.

47:02.420 --> 47:08.100
If you can put up with having way, way, way, way, way more shit

47:08.740 --> 47:11.940
in the place you live than you could possibly ever see,

47:11.940 --> 47:17.300
and as a result, sort of pay a convenience tax on that shit,

47:17.300 --> 47:21.540
like, yeah, there are 100 Thai places to go to.

47:21.540 --> 47:24.740
But like, buying groceries fucking sucks.

47:24.740 --> 47:27.300
Like, I think that if you are that kind of person,

47:27.300 --> 47:28.100
you can make that trade off.

47:28.100 --> 47:28.740
Go for it.

47:28.740 --> 47:30.820
Seriously, though, you have to look around.

47:30.820 --> 47:33.140
And I know that this has been kind of long and not funny,

47:33.140 --> 47:37.060
but I feel like this is, like, a huge issue that a lot of people

47:37.060 --> 47:39.780
We're a more mobile society than we've ever been before.

47:39.780 --> 47:40.260
Yes.

47:40.260 --> 47:42.660
It makes more sense than ever before, I think, too.

47:42.660 --> 47:44.820
It's never been easier to, like, stay in con—

47:44.820 --> 47:49.220
I mean, stay connected to the place you grew up

47:49.220 --> 47:50.820
and to the people that you love.

47:50.820 --> 47:53.540
And I think that makes us feel a lot more, you know,

47:53.540 --> 47:56.260
I think it puts more of an onus on you sometimes to travel

47:56.260 --> 48:02.180
because it, you know, you can still stay tethered to—

48:02.180 --> 48:03.460
Yeah, and I think it's also—

48:03.460 --> 48:05.940
I also think it's a social, you know, thing

48:05.940 --> 48:08.260
where there's kind of an understanding that, like,

48:08.260 --> 48:10.340
oh, if you really want to live it up,

48:10.340 --> 48:11.940
then you got to move somewhere bigger.

48:11.940 --> 48:12.580
Yeah, fuck that.

48:12.580 --> 48:13.460
Yeah, I think that's bullshit.

48:13.460 --> 48:17.860
There is no best city, like, period, except for Austin.

48:18.500 --> 48:21.540
You just have to find the best city for you,

48:21.540 --> 48:22.900
which is probably Austin.

48:24.340 --> 48:25.380
Okay, let's move on.

48:25.380 --> 48:27.060
Griffin, do you have a Yahoo question for me?

48:27.060 --> 48:27.700
Yeah, I sure do.

48:28.500 --> 48:31.140
I've been waiting for it, and I think you know the one I need.

48:31.140 --> 48:34.660
Oh, I don't.

48:34.660 --> 48:37.220
This one was sent in by Brian Root.

48:37.220 --> 48:37.860
Thanks, Brian.

48:37.860 --> 48:40.500
It's by Yahoo Answers user Machi, who asks,

48:41.860 --> 48:45.220
what are the consequences of brandishing a samurai sword in public?

48:46.660 --> 48:49.220
Can I just walk downtown with it without troubling anyone?

48:49.940 --> 48:50.980
I don't know, can you?

48:52.020 --> 48:52.580
I don't know.

48:52.580 --> 48:54.420
Since that's never happened before ever,

48:54.420 --> 48:55.460
it's hard to answer.

48:55.460 --> 48:56.660
I don't know, Time Ninja.

48:56.660 --> 49:00.980
Can you fucking keep it under wraps and keep your heels cool

49:00.980 --> 49:03.060
while you're walking down the street with that samurai sword?

49:04.260 --> 49:05.300
Wait, okay, wait, wait, wait.

49:06.020 --> 49:08.020
When he says brandishing, does he mean, like,

49:10.820 --> 49:12.020
on his belt?

49:12.020 --> 49:13.940
Or is he, like, he's walking around carrying it?

49:13.940 --> 49:16.340
He's walking full blown.

49:16.340 --> 49:18.500
Like, brandishing is out of the scabbard.

49:18.500 --> 49:22.420
Yeah, brandishing is out of the scabbard, like, shaking it at people.

49:22.420 --> 49:25.220
Right, scabbard in one hand, samurai sword in the other.

49:25.220 --> 49:26.260
I'm not troubling you.

49:27.300 --> 49:30.420
Holding them out, holding them aloft, full blown Michonne,

49:31.060 --> 49:33.700
just, like, ready to, looking like he's about to wreck shit.

49:34.420 --> 49:40.420
I think that I've never seen someone with a samurai sword

49:40.420 --> 49:42.660
scabbarded or unscabbarded.

49:42.660 --> 49:44.020
There, I wasn't troubled.

49:44.020 --> 49:45.060
I will be troubled.

49:45.060 --> 49:48.900
The trouble is inherent to having the samurai sword there.

49:48.900 --> 49:53.380
Unless you are a block away from San Diego Comic Con.

49:53.380 --> 49:55.940
But even then, it's like, go back to your fucking zoo.

49:58.100 --> 49:59.460
Then if you go half a block more,

49:59.460 --> 50:01.620
just a guy with a shotgun goes head on back now.

50:01.620 --> 50:04.500
Yep, nope, turn, turn right back around.

50:04.500 --> 50:06.740
He's going head on right on back.

50:06.740 --> 50:07.220
All right.

50:08.900 --> 50:13.620
Prison, I think, is a pretty, pretty solid consequence.

50:13.620 --> 50:17.780
See, I disagree, Griffin, and I think it's psychiatric counseling.

50:17.780 --> 50:21.380
I go, hey, so why did you think that was a good idea?

50:21.380 --> 50:22.340
Holy shit.

50:22.340 --> 50:29.060
This would be, like, an amazing movement against, like, gun nut people.

50:29.860 --> 50:32.820
As if, like, if people who don't like guns,

50:32.820 --> 50:35.460
why are they called anti-gun people?

50:35.460 --> 50:37.380
Just carrying around giant swords in public.

50:37.380 --> 50:40.420
And then the gun people are like, hey, you're making me super uncomfortable.

50:40.420 --> 50:44.740
And it's like, that's how that little thing in your belt makes me feel.

50:44.740 --> 50:47.300
I think what you have to do is you got to make sure,

50:47.300 --> 50:49.220
is there, like, some kind of government agency

50:49.220 --> 50:52.980
you go to to get a permit to carry your sword?

50:54.420 --> 50:55.380
There's got to be, right?

50:55.380 --> 50:57.140
You get a concealed carry for your gun.

50:57.780 --> 51:01.220
I think the True Love Weights card works pretty much the same way.

51:03.140 --> 51:04.420
Promise not to have sex.

51:04.420 --> 51:05.220
Yep.

51:05.220 --> 51:05.940
You got it.

51:05.940 --> 51:06.580
You got it.

51:06.580 --> 51:07.220
Here's your sword.

51:09.060 --> 51:11.220
That's what they should hand out at True Love Weights.

51:11.220 --> 51:14.100
Instead of a promise ring, you get a promise samurai sword

51:14.100 --> 51:15.700
because you are not having sex tonight.

51:15.700 --> 51:20.340
And here's either this or these steampunk goggles or this gesture hat.

51:23.060 --> 51:28.260
Man, fucking my kids will never believe high school in the aughts.

51:30.500 --> 51:31.940
There's a story called Hot Topic.

51:31.940 --> 51:32.980
It fucking sucked.

51:34.500 --> 51:36.580
No, surely that's just a story of legends.

51:37.700 --> 51:38.260
It was real.

51:38.260 --> 51:38.740
It sucked.

51:38.740 --> 51:40.500
Everything was really, really bad.

51:41.060 --> 51:42.500
It was a bad, bad time.

51:42.500 --> 51:44.660
It was a bad time, basically, for everybody.

51:44.660 --> 51:46.020
Nobody fucked.

51:46.020 --> 51:48.740
That's why the population dropped so significantly.

51:50.260 --> 51:54.020
Now hand me some of those MREs and some of the boiler water

51:54.020 --> 51:57.380
so we can continue to thrive in the Outlands.

51:59.380 --> 52:00.020
Let's see it.

52:00.020 --> 52:01.220
Thanks for nothing, Hot Topic.

52:02.180 --> 52:06.340
Here we wear our goggles unironically to protect ourselves from the radiation.

52:06.340 --> 52:07.860
That's in the death tornadoes.

52:10.660 --> 52:13.300
I wish we had samurai swords now because of the mutants.

52:13.300 --> 52:16.180
Hot Topic is going to sponsor children of men, too.

52:16.180 --> 52:18.740
And it's going to be like, no babies have been born.

52:18.740 --> 52:20.500
It's not because we stop fucking.

52:20.500 --> 52:23.540
It's just like, who wants to look at him?

52:23.540 --> 52:24.180
Look at him.

52:24.180 --> 52:25.700
He looks like a cyber clown.

52:27.700 --> 52:30.420
Clive Owen wearing ironic Super Mario t-shirt.

52:31.140 --> 52:32.340
Well, we're not fucking.

52:33.540 --> 52:35.300
His shirt has cat dog on it.

52:35.300 --> 52:36.740
It smells like Funyuns.

52:36.740 --> 52:37.300
I hate him.

52:39.060 --> 52:40.580
What happened to you, Clive Owen?

52:40.580 --> 52:42.660
You were in shoot him up.

52:45.300 --> 52:47.940
But now you're bracing that spikes on it.

52:47.940 --> 52:49.140
It's four inches wide.

52:50.100 --> 52:52.180
I'm having a hard time thinking about fucking you

52:52.180 --> 52:54.180
because you're playing Dance Dance Revolution.

52:54.180 --> 52:54.660
Can we go?

52:56.340 --> 52:57.220
Can we go?

52:57.220 --> 53:00.900
Can you put me in your giant black denim jean pocket and carry me away?

53:02.100 --> 53:03.140
Like a kangaroo.

53:05.380 --> 53:06.100
We done?

53:06.100 --> 53:06.420
Yep.

53:06.420 --> 53:07.060
Is that it?

53:07.060 --> 53:07.860
Enough jokes?

53:07.860 --> 53:08.180
All right.

53:08.180 --> 53:11.620
This has been My Brother, My Brother Meets an Advice Show for the Modern Era.

53:11.620 --> 53:15.620
We thank you so much for listening to it and enjoying it.

53:17.140 --> 53:22.340
Thank you to people tweeting about our program using the MBMBAM hashtag.

53:22.340 --> 53:25.780
I would ask that you, if you're going to tweet about our show,

53:26.980 --> 53:31.540
throw in some links to our sampler.

53:31.540 --> 53:34.500
It's bit.ly forward slash it's my bim bam.

53:34.500 --> 53:36.980
How's the second chapter of that coming out?

53:36.980 --> 53:39.620
The second one is like I'm sort of in the works.

53:40.340 --> 53:43.220
Justin's, it's been done for months.

53:43.220 --> 53:47.780
Justin's just whittling every precious millisecond off of it.

53:48.740 --> 53:50.900
He's trying to hone it down to the perfect.

53:50.900 --> 53:53.380
I just want to get it perfect and done.

53:54.980 --> 53:56.260
So that's coming along.

53:56.260 --> 53:56.980
I'm getting there.

53:58.900 --> 54:01.460
And thank you for sharing the show.

54:01.460 --> 54:01.960
Yeah.

54:03.220 --> 54:05.300
Hey, we need to get real serious for a moment.

54:05.300 --> 54:05.800
Okay.

54:05.800 --> 54:11.560
So there's this whole issue going around with podcasts.

54:11.560 --> 54:16.520
And there are some patent trolls that are really just being assholes.

54:16.520 --> 54:17.480
They're jerks.

54:17.480 --> 54:17.800
Yeah.

54:17.800 --> 54:21.960
Basically what it is, is they're claiming that they invented podcasts

54:21.960 --> 54:25.880
and everything that people do is illegal and infringing on their copyright.

54:27.080 --> 54:29.800
Our friends at Stuff You Should Know have been hit by it.

54:29.800 --> 54:31.080
Adam Kroll has been hit by it.

54:31.080 --> 54:34.120
It's a bunch of really shitty dudes doing this.

54:34.120 --> 54:36.200
Our only hope is right now going through Congress.

54:36.760 --> 54:38.680
It's what's called the Shield Act,

54:38.680 --> 54:42.760
which basically says that if this frivolous lawsuit comes up,

54:43.320 --> 54:47.160
if the podcast wins, if the defendant wins,

54:47.880 --> 54:51.800
the patent troll is forced to pay the legal fees.

54:51.800 --> 54:52.040
Right.

54:52.040 --> 54:57.000
It's the odds of us losing is negligible,

54:57.000 --> 55:02.600
but the legal fees would be, they would be crippling to,

55:02.600 --> 55:06.040
you know, if it hit us, it would be like pretty much the end of,

55:06.680 --> 55:10.360
like I don't think we could pay for what it would take to do it.

55:10.360 --> 55:14.680
And I think if Maximum Fun got hit, like it would be devastating.

55:14.680 --> 55:17.080
So we'd have to just start emailing you.

55:17.080 --> 55:18.760
We'd have to start mailing cassette tapes.

55:18.760 --> 55:18.920
Right.

55:18.920 --> 55:21.480
It would become a whole underground podcast movement.

55:21.480 --> 55:25.880
Do you know those email chains that your stepdad forwards to you

55:25.880 --> 55:31.080
and they kind of say some offensive stuff about Justice Sotomayor?

55:31.080 --> 55:32.920
And you're like, I don't know how to feel about this.

55:32.920 --> 55:36.040
That is basically what would be reduced to is email chains

55:36.040 --> 55:38.120
that we would send through your stepdad.

55:38.120 --> 55:40.200
So we're going to be posting a link for it today.

55:41.080 --> 55:43.640
We're working with the Electronic Frontier Foundation

55:44.280 --> 55:48.520
to mobilize podcast fans to contact their congresspeople about the Shield Act

55:48.520 --> 55:51.560
and tell them to, you know, pass it and help us.

55:51.560 --> 55:53.960
And it's really, it's important to us.

55:53.960 --> 55:55.880
It's important to Maximum Fun, but more than anything,

55:55.880 --> 55:59.480
it's kind of important to the podcast medium in general.

55:59.480 --> 56:02.120
So, you know, you guys are fans.

56:02.120 --> 56:05.240
Let's stop this thing together, I guess.

56:05.240 --> 56:09.160
So when we post that URL, I'm not sure you click it and do what you need to do.

56:09.160 --> 56:09.960
Yes, we can.

56:10.600 --> 56:11.800
Yes, we can.

56:11.800 --> 56:12.600
Finally.

56:12.600 --> 56:13.000
Change.

56:13.640 --> 56:14.200
Change.

56:14.200 --> 56:15.080
Changing to believe in.

56:15.880 --> 56:17.640
So that's going to do it for us here.

56:17.640 --> 56:18.840
I'm my brother, my brother and me.

56:18.840 --> 56:21.480
Thanks to John Roderick and a lot of winners for letting us use their song.

56:21.480 --> 56:24.040
It's a departure of the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

56:24.680 --> 56:29.000
You can go get that on iTunes and make sure you join us again next Monday

56:29.000 --> 56:30.040
for my brother and my brother and me.

56:30.040 --> 56:33.640
Oh, if you want to email us your questions, your quandaries, your queries,

56:33.640 --> 56:37.640
you send them to mbnbam at maximumfun.org.

56:38.520 --> 56:41.400
And if you want to get a birthday announcement or whatever,

56:41.400 --> 56:43.800
congratulate someone in a shout out.

56:43.800 --> 56:47.480
It's at maximumfun.org forward slash Jumbotron.

56:48.200 --> 56:48.680
It's finally out.

56:48.680 --> 56:50.120
Who was sent in by Ira Ray?

56:51.080 --> 56:52.360
Are you Ira Ray?

56:53.080 --> 56:55.880
See, I just tried to sing it, like sing the first part

56:55.880 --> 56:58.840
so that we could just like get through it as fast as we could.

56:58.840 --> 56:59.560
No dice.

56:59.560 --> 57:00.120
OK.

57:00.120 --> 57:00.760
Thanks, Ira Ray.

57:00.760 --> 57:03.560
It's by Yahoo Answers user moremots who asks,

57:05.320 --> 57:08.280
what around the house stuff can I use to make my daughter

57:08.280 --> 57:09.640
look like Benjamin Franklin?

57:12.600 --> 57:13.640
He's Justin McElroy.

57:13.640 --> 57:14.520
I'm Travis McElroy.

57:14.520 --> 57:15.800
I'm Griffin McElroy.

57:15.800 --> 57:30.600
This has been my brother, my brother and me, kiss your dad.
