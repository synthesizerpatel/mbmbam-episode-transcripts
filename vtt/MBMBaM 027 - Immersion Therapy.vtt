00:00.000 --> 00:04.620
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.740 --> 00:10.560
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.440 --> 00:17.640
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.640 --> 00:44.640
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:44.640 --> 00:52.240
The Chilean Miners, no merging once again. Listen, you may be willing to forget about them that quickly

00:52.240 --> 00:58.840
I'm not gonna forget about our Chilean brothers that emerged from the ground like that. How do we know there's not some more down there?

00:58.840 --> 01:00.840
Have we looked?

01:00.840 --> 01:08.720
Chilean Miner, a forgotten Chilean Miner emerging a week after everyone else has left from the ground

01:08.720 --> 01:15.520
This is my brother. My brother may emerging from the depths of ignorance to deliver weak old wisdom straight

01:16.120 --> 01:23.020
To your dome. Do you think like six weeks after the celebration someone looked around and said have you guys seen sleepy Tim?

01:23.240 --> 01:25.240
We're sleeping too shit

01:26.760 --> 01:28.800
Nice nice skinny Tim

01:30.720 --> 01:32.720
Lonely Tim

01:33.760 --> 01:36.520
Tim Tim is actually a very common name in Chile

01:36.520 --> 01:38.520
You guys may not know that

01:39.200 --> 01:44.320
Chile it's not it's not they weren't let lost in a mine inside one of the members of TLC

01:46.440 --> 01:48.600
No, they were lost in a Chili's restaurant

01:49.600 --> 01:52.440
They needed to be excavated from which I I mean

01:52.440 --> 01:56.160
I can't blame them of all the places to get stuck in the ground for three months

01:56.160 --> 02:01.840
I mean, they're their chicken strips are really out of this world guys. I don't care how awesome this blossom is

02:01.840 --> 02:04.640
I'm gonna fucking flip if I don't get out of here soon

02:04.640 --> 02:06.640
um

02:07.280 --> 02:11.760
Wait, wait, wait awesome blossom is out back. What does Chili's have that they have a they have a

02:12.520 --> 02:17.520
Version that is equitable to the awesome blossom. Anyway, the mediocre blossom

02:20.360 --> 02:22.360
This is an advice show

02:24.520 --> 02:26.760
Clearly I am your host and co-brother

02:27.800 --> 02:31.320
I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy

02:31.320 --> 02:37.400
And and we are gonna get right into the the wisdom the growth as it were

02:37.800 --> 02:40.520
I can't tell if this is gonna be a good one or a bad one

02:40.520 --> 02:42.080
But let's find out together

02:42.080 --> 02:46.360
One of my friends that I have known for years is a serious problem about washing his hands too much

02:46.360 --> 02:52.100
He washes them every 30 minutes and as it gets colder outside his hands start to crack and bleed because they are dry

02:52.360 --> 02:55.160
What should I do to get him to stop being a freak?

02:55.640 --> 02:57.640
Kevin from Gmail Kevin

02:57.640 --> 03:01.480
Your friend isn't like he's not like kooky

03:02.920 --> 03:06.460
What a crazy guy he got he's got Mark Summers itis

03:07.920 --> 03:11.120
No, yeah, he's got the summer. He's got the double there

03:11.520 --> 03:18.240
It seems kind of counterintuitive to me right like I wash my hands because they're dirty, but I wash them too much

03:18.240 --> 03:22.080
So now they have blood all over them, which is like the dirtiest substance in the man

03:22.080 --> 03:26.720
And as we all know you can wash all you want that blood's not coming off. No, never ever

03:26.720 --> 03:31.240
No, the blood stays. Maybe you need to invest in some gloves

03:32.440 --> 03:37.840
This is simple. The thing that worked for Mark Summers is something called immersion therapy

03:38.480 --> 03:42.640
Where to get over the fact that you're really worried about getting dirty

03:42.640 --> 03:46.200
They make you climb around in giant waffles covered in fake butter

03:48.560 --> 03:51.440
And that you can fix them pretty good

03:52.480 --> 03:54.480
So all you have to do is go to Nickelodeon

03:54.480 --> 03:56.320
or

03:56.320 --> 04:01.800
What's what's Nickelodeon's parent company? Because I know Nickelodeon is like shut down. I gotta go to Viacom

04:01.800 --> 04:04.200
I can show you where their office is in New York

04:04.760 --> 04:07.680
You just go there and you you try and get him

04:08.280 --> 04:09.880
arrange a

04:09.880 --> 04:11.440
90s style

04:11.440 --> 04:13.680
Game show with your friend as the host

04:13.800 --> 04:14.280
Yeah

04:14.280 --> 04:22.240
or Kevin you could realize that your friend has something called obsessive compulsive disorder and it's probably not gonna be fixed with a pat on

04:22.240 --> 04:26.520
The back and a couple of concerned looks. In fact, don't pat him on the back. I don't think that'll help

04:26.520 --> 04:33.440
I think that actually hurts the situation. Yes, that washes back. You can't hurt the situation. Look at those muscles. That guy's diesel

04:33.440 --> 04:38.400
I think what you need to do is if you realize it's been a little over 30 minutes

04:38.400 --> 04:42.040
Look at him go. Whoa, it's been 30 minutes better wash your hands or puppies are gonna die

04:43.040 --> 04:45.040
Help keep him on schedule

04:45.040 --> 04:49.400
That's all you can do is try to facilitate or just ridicule him endlessly

04:49.400 --> 04:53.480
That's the only way I can really get friends to do other things. I know a lot

04:53.480 --> 04:56.760
There are probably some people clucking their tongues out there and saying hey, that's a serious

04:57.400 --> 05:03.940
Listen, life's hard the fact that the guy washes his hands every half hour. It's not exactly debilitating. Okay, Howard

05:04.280 --> 05:08.400
Look at Howard Hughes. Okay, he managed to still build the spruce goose

05:11.240 --> 05:16.960
Yeah, but I mean think of all the life experiences that he's gonna miss out on now like he can't he'll never be able to hold

05:16.960 --> 05:19.720
His newborn baby for longer than 30 minutes at a time

05:22.720 --> 05:27.000
All things really when you're holding the baby things start to get really good around a minute 40

05:28.360 --> 05:34.560
That's true. The connection is really is really real there all his fingerprints will look like rushed bullshit. I

05:37.200 --> 05:42.440
See what you're going with for here, but you really could have needed to percolate a little bit more

05:42.440 --> 05:47.200
Oh dear brothers, my girlfriend says I play Wow too much

05:47.400 --> 05:51.440
I've lived with my girlfriend for eight years and started playing Wow a year ago

05:51.440 --> 05:56.680
I play a few hours a day, but she wants me to stop so I haven't been on the dating scene for ten years

06:05.920 --> 06:07.920
Yeah, my advice is to

06:07.920 --> 06:15.580
What's Wow sometimes when I'm faced with decisions like this this very difficult decision. This man is clearly facing

06:15.580 --> 06:21.120
I'd like to pretend that I've traveled back in time from a few years in the future where I'm so

06:21.800 --> 06:26.160
Cripplingly sad because of the decision I made and that by traveling back in time

06:26.160 --> 06:29.200
I can manage to stop myself from doing that terrible thing

06:30.060 --> 06:36.640
Which is a long long way of saying don't do what you're thinking about doing you're talking about like present time travel, right?

06:36.640 --> 06:38.640
Yeah, I'm talking about

06:39.360 --> 06:43.640
Hypothetical future to present time travel. Okay. Yeah, I like that idea

06:43.640 --> 06:47.800
I think it probably before it's gonna catch on you're gonna need to catch your name for it

06:47.800 --> 06:50.960
I'd suggest immersion therapy, but the

06:51.520 --> 06:53.640
But I I do like the premise here

06:54.920 --> 07:01.480
Form spring someday you are going to die and when you die you are not going to say to yourself gosh

07:01.480 --> 07:03.480
I wish I

07:03.480 --> 07:10.560
Had played Wow more you might however say I wish I hadn't dumped my girlfriend of eight years to play Wow more

07:10.680 --> 07:12.680
which is maybe the same principle of

07:13.800 --> 07:14.960
of

07:14.960 --> 07:19.480
As Griffins, but I like to keep the taste of death in every mouth every moment

07:19.480 --> 07:23.840
I think I think if you're thinking about your death your eventual death, you're always gonna make the best decision

07:23.840 --> 07:27.920
You need to live like you're dying and then die like you're dying. Yes

07:28.840 --> 07:31.080
Who's that pecan? What is that with that mild?

07:31.080 --> 07:33.960
I thought that's got kind of a butternut

07:35.200 --> 07:36.840
a

07:36.840 --> 07:41.720
Definite deathy kind of coming. I'll do it. I'm getting a note of grave

07:43.840 --> 07:49.720
Yeah, can I suggest proposing to your girlfriend of eight years get off in Wow

07:52.040 --> 07:58.800
No, no, no, no, this can only go well don't listen to Griffin come here and look at the screen for a second

07:58.800 --> 08:03.380
I know you don't play me. I buy you I buy your purple ring

08:04.680 --> 08:09.160
It's amethyst. I changed the name of my guild to I love you Susan

08:15.320 --> 08:19.320
My friend Tim and his girlfriend have a problem

08:19.840 --> 08:23.760
They never stopped making out and groping each other in front of the rest of us

08:23.760 --> 08:31.000
I'm gonna go ahead and submit that you're the problem. But let's go on. How do I go about stopping this at points?

08:31.000 --> 08:36.920
It's downright annoying also talking to them about it and telling them how we feel does nothing. I need something a little more

08:38.560 --> 08:40.320
Drastic

08:40.320 --> 08:42.320
Thoughts Carlo

08:42.540 --> 08:44.000
Carlo no

08:44.000 --> 08:45.080
Carlo

08:45.080 --> 08:52.280
You do realize that you're trying to stay on the way of the most powerful force in the universe make right making out

08:52.280 --> 08:53.760
a boner boners

08:53.760 --> 08:54.200
Yeah

08:54.200 --> 09:00.840
You're trying to stop a man and a woman who I'm guessing from your description or under the age of 17

09:01.000 --> 09:07.720
You're trying to get them to stop groping in public. We think you're gonna reinvent the wheel. Come on, Carlo and the full game

09:08.120 --> 09:12.040
And does it say in pub? Okay, it is so they are doing it in public

09:12.960 --> 09:18.200
For some people watching that happen. That's all they got. Yeah, that's all they have like yeah

09:18.200 --> 09:25.400
It's some people and I'm not gonna go to malls and just like to just see the just see people

09:25.400 --> 09:29.240
Just see people in love just express groping each other in a physical

09:30.080 --> 09:31.120
manner

09:31.120 --> 09:33.040
and public

09:33.040 --> 09:35.840
Yeah in in public places like outside the gap

09:36.840 --> 09:43.360
Some people need some people some people need that some people need it. No, they're wrong with that. I

09:44.880 --> 09:46.600
Mean there is something wrong with it

09:46.600 --> 09:50.040
It's there's something a little wrong with it, but I don't want to judge you my brother for Christ's sake

09:50.040 --> 09:54.140
I mean not you of course. We're not talking about you hypothetical people hypothetical Griffin

09:55.200 --> 09:58.440
some of us future present government some of us are

10:00.480 --> 10:04.440
Coming up on 30 and like to be reminded of what it's like to feel and

10:05.280 --> 10:07.280
Maybe Carlo you shouldn't

10:07.640 --> 10:11.960
Get in the way of that. Maybe I say that's just every time you see it. Yeah, like

10:11.960 --> 10:19.300
Oh, that's good. Oh, that's good, and then get go back in time. Go to Nickelodeon. She has get a container of GAC

10:26.120 --> 10:32.120
What's up, what's this all over me you've been slimed maybe you see I'm making out just yell I got mixed

10:32.160 --> 10:38.460
You can't do that in television, but you can't do it in my door room slimed. What's up? Just fire some kush balls at him

10:38.460 --> 10:42.020
All of a sudden they're on the Rosie O'Donnell show

10:45.540 --> 10:49.780
Cry minute Lee no, but really that you shouldn't do anything

10:50.580 --> 10:53.180
There's nothing you can do. I'll hate each other soon enough

10:53.180 --> 11:00.180
Yeah, and you don't want to you don't want to get in the way that I have this guy friend who to me is totally awesome

11:00.220 --> 11:04.420
That's in all caps. I don't think I can do it justice, but trust me. He's great

11:05.260 --> 11:06.220
funny

11:06.220 --> 11:07.380
chilly

11:07.380 --> 11:11.260
Left eye now T boss all that. Nope. Nope, those aren't in there

11:11.260 --> 11:17.900
The only he's chill all that the only problem is that to people that he isn't friends with he's just a total jerk

11:17.900 --> 11:22.700
Just the worst he's rude and downright unpleasant to be around. He's never violent or anything like that

11:22.700 --> 11:25.500
But still even though he's perfectly fine when he's hanging with me

11:25.500 --> 11:29.580
I find a lot of friends kind of look down to me for hanging around him because of this. What should I do?

11:29.860 --> 11:33.340
Thanks devil's advocate gmail. I like it

11:33.340 --> 11:36.100
So is it like a

11:36.580 --> 11:41.820
Jekyll and Hyde kind of thing or is it just that you like his bad attitude and your friends don't

11:43.340 --> 11:47.900
No, I think it's I think it's one of those scenarios where once he gets surrounded by too many people

11:48.940 --> 11:56.340
He transforms into a monster. He gets he get I mean you gotta I think the thing to remember is that it stems from a place of

11:57.700 --> 12:01.060
Some people when they're when I'm around a bunch of people, I don't know very well

12:01.060 --> 12:04.500
I I tend to to kind of clam up a little bit. I get a little

12:05.140 --> 12:10.860
Social phobic and his is probably just manifesting in a different way. In this case. He gets he gets on the

12:11.740 --> 12:13.740
You know, he gets on the offensive

12:14.820 --> 12:18.740
That's what it sounds like to me. I I think the trick is to

12:20.020 --> 12:25.780
Try exposing him to one friend at a time, you know until he gets comfortable with

12:26.420 --> 12:28.420
Both of you and then eventually

12:28.420 --> 12:34.540
You gotta find that magic number so that if you're hanging out with three friends and you bring in a fourth and he's still cool

12:34.540 --> 12:39.860
And then you bring in a fifth and he's like girl Jews, you know, like no, okay

12:39.860 --> 12:42.420
Not not five more or under

12:43.180 --> 12:46.260
Right now you're attempting what's called immersion therapy

12:49.220 --> 12:56.100
I don't think it's working. It's not for everyone. It weren't for Mark Summers, but that doesn't mean it's gonna work for Jerko over here

12:56.100 --> 12:58.980
But that doesn't mean it's gonna work for Jerko over here. Yeah

13:00.660 --> 13:04.180
Don't you guys think one friend at a time until you're like more comfortable with the group

13:04.180 --> 13:08.780
I I think that's the only way you can get or like is this guy worth it like

13:09.260 --> 13:14.980
He doesn't sound very cool. He's totally awesome. Totally awesome. You don't know him like he knows him

13:15.620 --> 13:20.540
Would you like here's another suggestion and if you're hanging out with friends?

13:20.540 --> 13:26.740
And you want it to just look like it's you and him then hide your friends around the room

13:26.740 --> 13:30.940
I love they were hanging out in like they talked to you and he's like, what was that?

13:30.940 --> 13:34.180
You're like, I didn't hear anything. I didn't hear I don't know what you're talking about that

13:34.180 --> 13:38.860
But yes, Greg, I would like to go to the Baltimore and then once he's been awesome for a while

13:38.860 --> 13:45.140
Your friends can jump out and be like that that behavior is the kind of behavior you should exhibit around us

13:45.500 --> 13:47.500
But are you scared? He's like fuck you

13:47.500 --> 13:49.420
I

13:49.420 --> 13:52.660
Don't trust people. How could you do this to me Richard?

13:54.220 --> 14:01.500
Guts, here's a Yahoo Answers question and it's it was sent in by hybrid misfit. Thank you hybrid misfit

14:02.140 --> 14:06.060
It's from Yahoo Answers user sick Nick who asks

14:06.500 --> 14:08.500
How can I make my rapping better?

14:10.340 --> 14:12.060
He has a very unique problem though

14:12.060 --> 14:17.980
He says when I rap I get a lot of saliva in my mouth and I don't sound when it happens

14:18.060 --> 14:21.380
How can I change that and can you give me other suggestions?

14:22.060 --> 14:29.180
Well, I mean, let's not put the cart before the horse. You need to handle your saliva situation first and foremost, right?

14:30.260 --> 14:31.780
I

14:31.780 --> 14:35.940
Think you should maybe just incorporate it into your into your act

14:35.940 --> 14:41.860
Well, yeah, well that's been a popular strategy. You ever wonder where Big Daddy Brawny came from

14:42.420 --> 14:47.060
Why people call him that is because he raps with a giant wad of paper towels in his mouth. Yeah

14:48.180 --> 14:54.920
DJ mumbles DJ mumble mouthful of cotton balls cotton balls. Yeah, DJ. How about just DJ Cudd?

14:56.700 --> 14:58.700
Kid Cudd kid Cuddy

14:59.620 --> 15:02.860
That's how he got his name. That's how he got his name exactly

15:02.860 --> 15:09.340
Uh, you might remember MC silica gel is actually actually died because you're not supposed to put silica gel on your mouth

15:09.340 --> 15:13.540
But you get that you get the idea. I mean went young but god those rhymes

15:13.940 --> 15:15.700
So it's so dry

15:15.700 --> 15:21.660
It's hard to corner the rap market nowadays because you have to be doing you have to have something new

15:22.820 --> 15:24.980
like for instance, I think

15:25.780 --> 15:30.180
Kanye West does it just with you know, really clever rhymes and catchy beats

15:30.180 --> 15:37.340
I'm being crazy and being crazy and and soldier boy does it by being really super untalented which is

15:38.300 --> 15:45.420
Itself kind of you know unique. So I think what you can do is just have a lot of spit in your mouth while you're rapping

15:45.940 --> 15:47.860
Yeah, like

15:47.860 --> 15:52.180
Julie DJ Julie something. There's something along those lines jaw drool

15:52.820 --> 15:56.660
Yeah drool. Uh-huh. And all your lyrics could be about it too

15:56.660 --> 16:01.500
Like when I spit rhymes, you know, you'll really get wet something like that. Oh my god

16:01.500 --> 16:06.040
This is you will get wet. You may get soaked the names kids slimy. Don't you never forget?

16:09.020 --> 16:13.780
Can you can you give me four more lines, let me say let me see what I got in here

16:16.500 --> 16:22.140
When I'm done with you kids you're gonna need a towel I'm gonna open your eyes I'm gonna empty your bowels

16:22.140 --> 16:27.540
Is that two lines that's two lines that's two lines

16:29.820 --> 16:32.780
When I'm on the MIC things will never be dry

16:35.500 --> 16:39.880
Come on you can do this. You've almost got it Justin Justin

16:40.780 --> 16:42.780
I'm gonna dampen your shirt and spit in your eye

16:45.580 --> 16:47.580
Okay

16:47.580 --> 16:51.540
Ah form spring says, okay

16:52.180 --> 16:59.620
All right. My older brother is balding. He tries to hide with hats hoodies bonnets, etc

17:01.420 --> 17:06.340
Unfortunately, he cannot rock a hat and is wearing a hoodie indoors makes him look like a rapist

17:07.620 --> 17:11.300
How do we get him to get right with his MPB?

17:11.980 --> 17:13.980
form spring I

17:13.980 --> 17:18.060
Don't like that male pattern baldness, okay

17:18.900 --> 17:24.740
I think last just to clarify last week. I think we covered no one can rock a hat

17:25.100 --> 17:29.820
No, you can have you can wear a hat and sometimes you can't even do that. Yeah

17:31.300 --> 17:33.300
Sometimes you're just barely wearing a hat

17:34.140 --> 17:39.260
You need to explain to your brother that we are in a time period now. We're bald people are awesome

17:39.260 --> 17:45.900
Yeah, it's the most socially acceptable bald as ever been. I think I agree. I think he's just shave it and call it a day

17:45.900 --> 17:49.820
Was that is that because of Moby you think because I might be mainly

17:49.820 --> 17:54.440
I think Moby is the really the one that turned it around because I mean it was cool to be bald and like

17:54.580 --> 17:59.540
55 but Moby was like nah dog. I'm 22 and now I have a bald head

17:59.540 --> 18:04.460
I remember in that interview where Bruce Willis was like, thank God for Moby. Thanks for me

18:04.460 --> 18:11.500
Okay, the thing is the the step one to getting your sexy right is always acceptance

18:11.700 --> 18:13.700
You gotta accept who you are

18:14.020 --> 18:16.300
Wearing a hat and hoodie and bonnet. I

18:16.940 --> 18:18.940
hopefully not really a bonnet but

18:19.380 --> 18:21.100
Wearing that kind of stuff

18:21.100 --> 18:26.700
That doesn't that doesn't that says I'm ashamed. Yeah of something that's utterly out of my control

18:27.660 --> 18:33.060
That's not sexy. You should say you're proud of it because it's something you got that most people don't

18:33.060 --> 18:34.500
uh

18:34.500 --> 18:38.620
Shave your eyebrows and then walk around to Sam fuck you like just like that

18:39.420 --> 18:41.420
Point at I'm like, what's up with these?

18:41.620 --> 18:48.620
But then grow a huge beard a huge beard and break your own nose so that it's just slightly tilted to the left

18:48.620 --> 18:53.700
Whoa, I like this. Yeah, look we're doing like a willy-willy thing here. You're welcome

18:53.700 --> 18:57.300
There's a lot more than you paid for my friend gauge one of your ears

18:57.300 --> 19:03.880
Really big like I'm shrink the other one to shrink one ear entirely. I

19:05.240 --> 19:07.680
Guarantee you if you do that, no one will notice you are bald

19:09.640 --> 19:10.840
Guaranteed

19:10.840 --> 19:16.880
But I think in short shave it just shave it get done with it one of the funniest guys

19:16.880 --> 19:19.120
I know outside of my family brentel floss

19:19.360 --> 19:25.000
You made that decision like just shaved his head so much cooler now great-looking guy very funny

19:25.000 --> 19:31.060
Popular with the ladies. It's a look. It's a look that you need to you know convince your brother now

19:31.060 --> 19:33.060
How do you convince your brother to do it?

19:33.320 --> 19:38.040
You do it while he's sleeping and and probably try to get some facial hair just something down there

19:38.040 --> 19:40.720
You should shave his head and then glue that hair to his face

19:41.880 --> 19:46.480
Yeah, I like it. I personally think that you shouldn't

19:47.120 --> 19:50.920
Encourage him to go bald. I think I think I just I

19:50.920 --> 19:54.480
Can't you guys couldn't convince me to go bald is the thing?

19:54.480 --> 20:00.280
I'm thinking about it it from from the brothers perspective if you guys came to me or like hey, bro

20:00.760 --> 20:06.140
You got to get rid of that hair. There's there's no way. There's no force on earth that could Griffin force

20:06.140 --> 20:13.040
I can change your mind right now. Okay, if you shave your head you could shave three seconds off of your lap time in the pool

20:16.880 --> 20:18.880
Damn it

20:18.880 --> 20:23.100
Griffin I'm I'm afraid you've misunderstood the premise of the show see

20:23.300 --> 20:28.060
When you try to take our advice in the real world and apply them practically to your situation

20:28.060 --> 20:30.840
That's when things that's when the wheels really fall off

20:30.980 --> 20:35.140
The idea with my brother my brother me is that we give it an answer that'll have them saying hey

20:35.140 --> 20:39.040
Yeah, exactly. Why don't I just do that and then as soon as they try to apply it

20:39.040 --> 20:41.460
It all collapses around them like a castle made of lies

20:43.380 --> 20:47.760
We got a question from Steph via Gmail she says

20:47.760 --> 20:49.240
I

20:49.240 --> 20:54.240
Just recently graduated from college at Berkeley and I packed my bags and moved away to the San Francisco

20:54.560 --> 21:00.480
Peninsula with my boyfriend for a job at Stanford our friends in Berkeley are too lazy to come visit us

21:00.600 --> 21:03.840
We visit them and we have no friends on the peninsula

21:04.000 --> 21:08.720
How do you meet people and make friends after college, especially 20-somethings?

21:08.760 --> 21:12.560
We're both nerdy people who like video board games and comic books

21:12.560 --> 21:18.040
Not video board games not like the clue VHS

21:18.680 --> 21:21.760
Baker Street Nightmare and comic books

21:22.360 --> 21:24.560
We prefer to meet other well-adjusted nerds

21:24.600 --> 21:30.660
The problem with this is that most nerds I've met are single men and are awkward and uninterested when we approach them as a couple

21:30.680 --> 21:33.140
But try to ask me out when I don't have my boyfriend around

21:33.600 --> 21:37.820
It's happened recently. Yeah gross when I went to a local board game shop and ask if they had a game night

21:37.820 --> 21:43.800
We don't need to meet nerds, but we also want to have some stuff in common with our future fantastic friends

21:44.160 --> 21:52.240
That is a tough question. Yeah, it's like it's like a treatise of everything. That's that's wrong with with the nerd culture, right?

21:52.240 --> 21:56.980
Yeah, it's it's a nice summation of everything. That's terrible. Yeah, I mean

21:59.760 --> 22:01.760
If it's any indication

22:01.760 --> 22:09.240
The the questions that we get apparently all nerdy people are nervous about talking to all other nerdy people. Yeah

22:09.840 --> 22:14.040
Ooh, ooh, wait a minute. Okay. I've got it. You don't

22:15.600 --> 22:20.480
You need to realize that nerdy couples are still made of two nerdy people

22:20.520 --> 22:25.880
They're gonna feel just as uncomfortable as they did in the main. We were in another mating process here

22:26.040 --> 22:29.140
This is this is an amazing negotiation

22:29.140 --> 22:31.540
even that doesn't end with

22:34.620 --> 22:39.820
Conception it ends with inception inception and going

22:43.420 --> 22:48.040
It ends with you know, sitting around a table and playing some less on earth something something nerdy

22:50.200 --> 22:52.980
The fact of the matter is that making friends

22:52.980 --> 22:58.820
meeting new people that will then become like friends and not like acquaintances but straight-up friends is

22:59.020 --> 23:02.140
More difficult than meeting members of the opposite sex

23:02.140 --> 23:06.180
I think it's also more difficult than once you're in a couple

23:06.580 --> 23:10.860
Because I think when you're solo you can sort of make those negotiations a lot easier

23:10.860 --> 23:14.460
You can pretend to be somebody you're not when you're flying by yourself

23:14.460 --> 23:18.740
But when you're in a couple, it's sort of like that person's gonna know what's up and you know

23:18.740 --> 23:21.500
They've got to like the situation you're in too

23:21.500 --> 23:23.500
Mm-hmm. That's intimidating

23:23.500 --> 23:26.300
I mean if you're looking for people to meet at a bar

23:26.300 --> 23:30.860
You don't go to the couple that's sitting by themselves at a table like hey guys, what's up?

23:30.860 --> 23:34.540
Are you having the buffalo wings? Huh? Let me get down on let me just snack

23:35.420 --> 23:40.860
Well, I I stand by that as far as meeting friends. You always do good meeting people at work

23:41.440 --> 23:42.380
meeting people

23:42.380 --> 23:49.780
You know at hobbies that you're both doing like if you if you guys join a pottery class or go to a coffee shop or something

23:49.780 --> 23:54.220
Like that anything like that where it's not just random strangers, but people, you know

23:55.220 --> 23:57.980
But that doesn't always mean you're gonna meet the best people

23:58.940 --> 24:03.600
Because you're limited to the people that are in that group, but it's you know people

24:04.500 --> 24:08.160
You at work put up a political flyer on campus. It says

24:08.780 --> 24:15.220
Hey, we're is anybody want to play some board games or something together for couples only a couple nerd night and then

24:15.220 --> 24:19.100
I'm not gonna make it sound so sad though. Yeah, that's

24:19.940 --> 24:21.980
That's an awfully tight filter to put on that

24:21.980 --> 24:28.060
I think maybe just a flyer with your personal phone number and the message who wants to party

24:29.740 --> 24:35.940
Looking to share fun with another couple. Yeah, something like that like something very open and honest and

24:36.700 --> 24:42.620
Looking for open couple to share with other open couple. That's good because you want open honesty

24:42.620 --> 24:44.780
and big and big

24:45.940 --> 24:51.820
Couple looking for other couple for a foursome, but then in much smaller letters for Scrabble

24:52.620 --> 24:53.860
maybe

24:53.860 --> 24:57.220
You know and you want to go back and forth between a few different games

24:57.220 --> 25:02.200
So make sure that they're willing to swing you want to say that in the flyer like looking for couple

25:02.900 --> 25:04.900
open-minded couple willing to swing

25:05.460 --> 25:10.420
And maybe you can play that hot new board game from Mattel key party. Yeah

25:10.420 --> 25:12.620
Okay down for a key party

25:13.140 --> 25:18.340
Maybe a convention would be good some sort go to comic-con or something and look for

25:18.980 --> 25:20.140
women

25:20.140 --> 25:23.020
Dressed as superheroes because you know, they didn't do that on their own

25:25.460 --> 25:27.460
That's just science

25:28.220 --> 25:35.500
Seth I'm sorry that we don't have more practical help for you here this I mean Jesus if I knew this then like

25:35.500 --> 25:41.860
We need to listen to another podcast like my brother my brother my brother my brother and me

25:42.060 --> 25:44.340
Where am I super well-adjusted uncle?

25:49.020 --> 25:51.420
The only thing they do on that show is give us advice

25:52.220 --> 25:58.020
And and they could tell me how to do this because I'm right there in the same boat except I'm starting to realize that

25:58.460 --> 26:04.620
Everyone's kind of just floating through this void of nobody knows how to talk to anybody else

26:04.620 --> 26:10.820
Like you know, we just get so many questions about how do I start conversations? How do I meet people?

26:11.660 --> 26:18.740
Everybody we are not solitary beings and people that feel solitary is because they are the most afraid

26:19.260 --> 26:22.820
Unless you're on the reality show solitary and then you're yes alone

26:23.780 --> 26:26.620
You might you might trust I know this seems like

26:27.460 --> 26:32.580
Counterintuitive considering what we just talked about but you might try Facebook. There's certainly there's got to be some like

26:32.580 --> 26:38.540
San Francisco gaming groups on Facebook. Maybe go there and say hey, we're looking for couples to

26:39.660 --> 26:41.660
to hang out with

26:41.740 --> 26:46.300
The trick is the area for couples. The trick is to just find that one couple

26:46.420 --> 26:50.540
Yeah that you can be cool with and then they know eight or nine other couples

26:51.100 --> 26:53.100
Especially they've lived on the San Francisco Peninsula

26:53.980 --> 26:55.980
for a while

26:55.980 --> 27:01.580
Uh, hey move in ma'am. I'm always always hungry

27:02.700 --> 27:08.380
There literally isn't a time when I couldn't eat. I'm not a fat guy, but I fear I may become one

27:09.180 --> 27:14.500
Keep up the what should I do? Keep up the amazing work, especially the deep voice guy who isn't Justin or Griffin?

27:14.500 --> 27:21.740
I like him Harrison Gmail. I like you too Harrison Harrison. I do want to clarify for you. That is how people become fat guys

27:21.740 --> 27:29.340
So that's not like a fear like something ephemeral that may like no you won't you that won't happen

27:29.340 --> 27:34.100
I'm afraid of ghosts and also that I'll get fat if I eat too much food

27:35.420 --> 27:37.420
What a fear? Yeah

27:37.940 --> 27:42.740
I I know that I feel the same way I as we have discussed

27:43.300 --> 27:47.360
Previously, I could literally always eat something at any point in the day

27:47.360 --> 27:54.760
But really that is because a lot of the time I'm just massively bored and usually boredom leads to hunger. So maybe

27:55.320 --> 27:58.000
Try some food instead of a sandwich

27:58.840 --> 28:00.760
Mm-hmm

28:00.760 --> 28:02.760
Get a Gameboy

28:03.440 --> 28:07.000
All of these things help oh my god Harrison you have a tapeworm

28:09.400 --> 28:13.040
Harrison you have a tapeworm you have to go to the doctor but wait if he has a tapeworm

28:13.040 --> 28:17.760
Then he won't get fat right because it takes all the food for him

28:18.520 --> 28:24.080
But the tapeworm will eat all the food before he can digest it and use its energy and he'll eat all the good food

28:24.080 --> 28:28.960
Too what if he's pregnant? Oh my god, Harrison with a tapeworm

28:29.800 --> 28:35.600
Pregnant with a tapeworm baby. Oh god. I shall name him Philip

28:35.600 --> 28:42.960
He is my tapeworm baby, and I love him. It's just like that movie jr

28:43.800 --> 28:51.880
Except he is a tapeworm and Noah Arnold Schwarzenegger. He's always hungry. So it's just like the movie jr. Except for the tapeworm, but I

28:52.760 --> 28:59.680
Went to the Sears. I went to the Sears baby department and they had no clothes that would fit my tapeworm, baby. I

29:00.560 --> 29:01.880
ended up

29:01.880 --> 29:06.600
With a pantyhose for super skinny ladies. That's what I had to walk out of there with

29:06.600 --> 29:12.280
Can you imagine the look on Philips face when I hand him that I sewed a little ducky on to it

29:13.840 --> 29:19.680
Still don't think it's gonna fly but I love him and he is my child and he is going to go to college

29:20.240 --> 29:22.900
And I'm planning a playdate with my neighbor's monkey, baby

29:23.840 --> 29:26.560
Harrison Harrison don't eat anymore

29:27.200 --> 29:29.200
just pump the brakes like

29:29.200 --> 29:33.200
I'm something to do that takes up hours of the day that you

29:34.360 --> 29:40.600
The fact that you are not fat guy yet does not make you special like yeah fat people feel that way, too

29:40.600 --> 29:44.200
That's why they're fat like it's not like what how could this happen?

29:44.200 --> 29:49.480
Like this is how it happens that you start out this way and then you eat so much that you turn fat when you're fat

29:49.480 --> 29:55.800
You can you can go back and you can chart out a history of double downs that made you what you are now

29:55.800 --> 30:01.820
Get it. Listen Harrison. Just pump the brakes. Listen to my brother Griffin. Just slow it down if you want to eat something

30:03.280 --> 30:05.280
Lots of people just don't away

30:06.040 --> 30:08.240
It could be that the food you're eating is too good

30:08.240 --> 30:10.000
Did you try eating healthy food?

30:10.000 --> 30:12.160
Cuz if you only have healthy food in the house

30:12.360 --> 30:16.400
Then you won't want to eat as much because it doesn't taste or or just get moderately poor

30:17.320 --> 30:23.000
Yeah today to the point where you can't really afford a lot of food. Oh

30:23.000 --> 30:26.840
Oh, that's good. I like that. But then you'll start eating out of the garbage

30:27.160 --> 30:28.360
Yeah, don't do that

30:28.360 --> 30:33.720
Like a giant raccoon the tapeworm will wrap around it Philip will wrap around his brain and make him go to the garbage

30:33.720 --> 30:38.320
It's pretty good. I'm starving. I have a Yahoo answer that

30:39.040 --> 30:43.880
It kind of goes against one of our our core tenets here at my brother my brother and me

30:43.880 --> 30:49.560
But it's I feel like it's gonna open up a really interesting dialogue between the three of us

30:49.560 --> 30:53.520
So I think it might be worth the the infraction against our own rules

30:54.080 --> 30:58.240
Okay, but if I read the title and you guys don't want to go ahead with it

30:58.240 --> 31:01.160
Like I'll totally understand it won't hurt my feelings at all

31:02.340 --> 31:04.340
it was sent in by

31:04.800 --> 31:08.600
Listener Benjamin Carl the man so nice. They named him twice

31:09.400 --> 31:14.840
And the the question itself was crafted by Floyd brewer who asks I?

31:14.840 --> 31:22.040
Am trying to get my son trained to defecate in a bag instead of a toilet or diaper any suggestions or tips

31:24.440 --> 31:27.880
My wife and I are very environment conscious and have been thinking

31:31.400 --> 31:35.560
He hasn't potty trained yet and we don't really want him formally trained to use a toilet

31:35.560 --> 31:42.480
Which we believe wastewater and drains resources my wife and I started my wife and I started going in bags

31:42.480 --> 31:50.000
about two years ago, and we use the excrement blended with other materials to fertilize our garden and

31:50.000 --> 31:51.520
also and

31:51.520 --> 31:55.040
Also, sell it to friends for extra spending money

31:58.800 --> 32:03.760
But we have problems getting him to squat and be patient enough to go how can we encourage it?

32:03.760 --> 32:05.760
How can we encourage him prizes?

32:06.640 --> 32:08.560
punishment

32:08.560 --> 32:14.880
What is work for you you shit in that bag or so help me Derrick so help me if you don't shit in that bag

32:14.880 --> 32:17.680
Derrick you shit in that bag or you are grounded

32:18.320 --> 32:20.320
Hey, I'm someone's

32:20.320 --> 32:28.880
I'm sorry weirdo, but what punishment are you gonna levy against this child that even approaches the social punishment of going to school the first day

32:28.880 --> 32:31.280
Asking the teacher where you can go shit in the bag

32:31.280 --> 32:33.280
Excuse me, where is the shit bag room?

32:33.280 --> 32:35.280
He totally pre-empted that

32:35.280 --> 32:41.360
Because in the additional details, he says he won't need a bag to be packed into his backpack because he will be home-schooled

32:41.920 --> 32:47.600
Again, he doesn't have to worry about being made fun of because he will be home-schooled bitch. Listen

32:48.400 --> 32:53.920
It doesn't school. That's a that's one one part of that kid's life. How about mall?

32:53.920 --> 32:58.000
How about next time he goes to the mall? He's at the arcade and he feels like deuce coming and he has to bag it

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Right there. Where's your bag dispenser?

33:00.000 --> 33:08.880
Where's your bag dispenser? What about the first time he goes to the produce department the grocery store and gets confused as fuck?

33:09.680 --> 33:16.080
Hey, where's this human shit? Where and and who made it? Is that like an in-house thing that you guys you guys provide?

33:16.160 --> 33:18.000
Is that a service?

33:18.000 --> 33:20.720
There's one nugget. Pardon the pun of this

33:21.360 --> 33:23.360
question that sticks in my head and that is

33:24.080 --> 33:26.080
selling

33:26.400 --> 33:28.160
Sticks in my hair at what?

33:28.160 --> 33:33.440
Selling it to their friends for extra spending money. Who the fuck are your friends?

33:33.840 --> 33:39.680
Is there a jar somewhere that they just slide their extra their extra change into that they got from selling their human shit?

33:40.240 --> 33:44.240
To their very real friends and when that jar gets full they go to disney world

33:45.680 --> 33:48.000
Um, this is human poop we're talking about

33:49.040 --> 33:52.000
If you really want to help your child, here's how you do it

33:52.800 --> 33:54.800
You put the child on a porch

33:54.800 --> 34:00.240
You scatter your fecal matter around your home and you burn it down with you inside it

34:01.600 --> 34:08.000
There is literally no way that child could be better off than you and your wife doing the right thing here

34:08.720 --> 34:12.640
And burning your house down with you inside it. It is the only choice you have

34:12.880 --> 34:15.840
I don't know that this is true, but I have to imagine that

34:17.040 --> 34:19.040
child protective services

34:19.280 --> 34:22.560
Goes through the internet looking for things exactly like this

34:22.560 --> 34:27.680
Nah have to right? This is cool. I mean, it's pretty much a science project if you think about it

34:28.800 --> 34:35.600
Nah, it's that green movement. You can't get the you can't child protective services isn't gonna do shit about more like a brown movement

34:37.600 --> 34:40.480
You monster hey, it looks like you're just

34:41.280 --> 34:43.520
cupping your child's naked bottom with your hands

34:43.680 --> 34:48.400
No, it's cool. I have a bag bag here and i'm trying to get it to poop in the bag

34:48.560 --> 34:50.560
The little bastard just won't do it

34:50.560 --> 34:54.100
He thinks he's too good for pooping in a bag punishment

34:54.860 --> 34:57.840
Punishment what punishment you're gonna rub his nose in it

34:59.200 --> 35:01.760
Fuck did you just honey? Did you just hear a flush?

35:02.880 --> 35:06.080
Derek Derek, did you bring a toilet into this house?

35:07.040 --> 35:09.040
What?

35:09.280 --> 35:11.440
You know, it is such a fine line

35:12.880 --> 35:18.320
Children cannot be the defining line between crazy person and unconventional parent

35:18.320 --> 35:23.760
You can't just cross the line because you had a kid. You can't just be like no now i'm normal

35:24.160 --> 35:28.560
I just want to teach my child different things. You're still a crazy person

35:29.120 --> 35:30.880
You're still insane

35:30.880 --> 35:32.880
It's 2010 dog

35:33.200 --> 35:39.280
It's 2010 and it worries me that there's another person in this world. There is more than one person

35:39.360 --> 35:42.640
There are two people and they found each other that find it. Okay to poop in a bag

35:42.640 --> 35:50.560
Hey, if you're worried about finding your special somebody it'll never happen. Look at these two fuck ups. Um, do you think it's okay for them to

35:52.240 --> 35:56.560
To make pee in a toilet to make water now they go to the garden

35:57.520 --> 36:00.160
That can't be good for the plants. It's terrible for the plants

36:00.160 --> 36:00.640
What do they care?

36:00.640 --> 36:06.560
I need to find out what state these people live in and never buy any produce that came from that state because maybe that's how

36:06.640 --> 36:11.200
Shit rolls in montana. Like maybe that's maybe that's a common thing there. Why?

36:11.200 --> 36:18.320
Why literally this this this question is indicative of my my terrible fear that there are giant parts of the country that I know

36:18.400 --> 36:20.400
Nothing about where things like this happen

36:20.720 --> 36:23.280
Or there's just poop everywhere. Did you want to?

36:24.160 --> 36:28.880
Thank you for coming to the farmers market. Did you want to buy some of my plums? They're really dope

36:29.040 --> 36:34.400
I fertilize them with my friend's fecal matter. They're currently training their kid to not just my friend

36:34.400 --> 36:40.480
It's my friend's son's fecal matter and it gives the the eggplants here. It just they're so firm

36:40.480 --> 36:45.760
They're so so firm so for the skin is so tight. I'm so disgusted right now

36:46.240 --> 36:48.480
What could be like you've got it?

36:49.120 --> 36:51.280
People like this kind of pull the camera back

36:52.080 --> 36:54.880
You're worried about the planet cool. Why?

36:55.280 --> 37:00.160
Well, we're gonna have kids on this planet someday and we want to take care of it for them cool

37:00.560 --> 37:05.520
did you know your kid doesn't care if it's seven degrees hotter in july because they're

37:06.300 --> 37:08.800
Experiencing that heat while pooping in a bag

37:08.800 --> 37:13.280
Isn't the whole point of it to make the world a better place for your kid?

37:13.680 --> 37:19.280
You actively do that by inventing toilets categorically a worse place because of your son

37:20.000 --> 37:23.840
Yeah, because you have a son that's pooping in a container. That's not a toilet

37:24.240 --> 37:28.320
Forget about the world for him. Like I don't care about this kid anymore. He's dead to me

37:29.440 --> 37:31.440
Nothing's coming good out of this but

37:32.640 --> 37:36.000
Here here's here's a new game. I want to start playing on. Um

37:36.000 --> 37:38.080
Um, my brother my brother me

37:38.960 --> 37:41.680
And it's called things. You never hear the president say

37:42.640 --> 37:47.680
And number one on my list is yeah, my parents trained me to poop in a bag

37:49.120 --> 37:51.120
But I basically they did it

37:51.840 --> 37:56.240
Through a punishment regimen. That was it was very it was strict but fair

37:56.880 --> 37:57.920
Yeah

37:57.920 --> 37:59.840
I don't want to know what that entails

37:59.840 --> 38:00.400
Yeah

38:00.400 --> 38:06.240
Um, the idea of this is still like it's gonna haunt me I think because I think the world is different now for me

38:06.240 --> 38:07.760
a little bit

38:07.760 --> 38:11.200
Because because there are people like this. This is not a guy who's fucking with us

38:11.200 --> 38:14.720
Like this is a real guy in the world somewhere

38:14.800 --> 38:19.440
There's a couple that made eye contact one night and said, you know, honey

38:19.520 --> 38:25.200
I've been thinking about it and i've the decision is made it's time for us to start pooping in bags

38:25.760 --> 38:28.880
How do you bring that up with your loved one? Like do you?

38:28.880 --> 38:30.400
Do you

38:30.400 --> 38:35.120
See them going to the toilet one day and just go there's a better way, you know, i've been thinking

38:36.560 --> 38:39.280
Wait a minute. I'm wasting a lot of water here. Um

38:40.480 --> 38:43.040
Follow me. Let's just follow me. Maybe just bag it

38:43.840 --> 38:46.480
Because that doesn't waste any resources. That's a thank god

38:46.480 --> 38:51.200
If you didn't want to waste if you didn't want to waste resources, you would just go shit directly on your crops

38:51.840 --> 38:53.040
Just go shit

38:53.040 --> 38:57.680
Directly out on your flower bed instead of doing what you're doing right now, which is shitting directly on your kid

38:57.680 --> 39:01.840
I mean, I have one question for you paper or plastic

39:02.860 --> 39:04.860
Delicious. Ah, hey

39:05.200 --> 39:10.400
Uh, i'm gonna stick with burning your house down with you inside it. Um, but not the kid. It's not the kid's fault

39:11.280 --> 39:13.280
Except if he does it if he does this crazy thing

39:13.280 --> 39:17.280
You're telling him to do then he's not made of strong enough stock to survive in this world

39:17.360 --> 39:22.560
We live in although he will be the best hobo. He will be the most conscientious hobo

39:22.720 --> 39:25.360
He'll be like the MacGyver of hobos

39:25.360 --> 39:27.440
He like toothless Jim will be like

39:28.400 --> 39:33.840
Derek I thought you said you had to use the bathroom. He said I totally did. I did see that Wendy's bag. Don't go

39:34.560 --> 39:36.560
to that

39:36.640 --> 39:42.960
Not that bag or that bag or that bag that because I only do that in bags. That's my that's kind of my thing

39:43.040 --> 39:45.520
That's why they that's why they call me stink bag. Derek

39:46.080 --> 39:48.080
Don't the coolest thing about these this

39:48.300 --> 39:54.000
Environmental sound couple they use a one industrial sized trash bag for every bowel movement

39:54.000 --> 39:56.880
One giant plastic bag for everyone

39:58.160 --> 40:01.280
Oh, i'm so sad. I don't even want to like

40:02.320 --> 40:05.360
I don't even want to end the show. I just want to end my life

40:06.960 --> 40:12.480
Is that possible can we do that can we work that out let's suffer through it, okay, uh

40:13.440 --> 40:15.920
I want to hear Griffin's last question. I don't really

40:16.480 --> 40:18.640
But i'm gonna say that I want to hear Griffin's last question

40:18.640 --> 40:25.280
