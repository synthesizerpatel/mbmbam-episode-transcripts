WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
If you change your mind on the first in line Honey I'm still free take a chance on me

00:09.000 --> 00:19.000
If you need me let me know I'm gonna be around If you got no place to go when you're feeling down

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown

00:24.000 --> 00:32.000
Oh friends, dear, dear friends, we're here again, gathered around the internet to talk about life.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
It's my brother, my brother, and me, NBNBA and the Mamba.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
I am Justin McElroy.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
I'm Travis McElroy.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
I'm Griffin McElroy. Who's everyone rooting for in the 2010 World Cup?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Honduras!

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Really?

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Yeah.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
I'm, I'm rooting for America.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Yeah, that's the correct answer. Thank you, Travis.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Okay.

00:56.000 --> 01:06.000
I don't think it matters. I've been loosely following it through everyone's tweets and Facebooks and Friendster updates and it sounds like every game is just tying.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
So far the score for the World Cup is four to four.

01:11.000 --> 01:20.000
What I've decided is not to root for anyone because if I make a choice I am rooting for soccer and that goes against everything I believe in.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
So if you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
This is an advice show for the modern era.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
We take your questions, we answer them.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
If you want to learn how to get your question answered by us, stay tuned at the end of the show.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
We will provide that information.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Our first question comes to us from Mike.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
He writes from Gmail.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
He says, I'm in a bit of a pickle.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Oh, Mike, that sounds bad.

01:43.000 --> 01:51.000
I live in Columbus, Ohio where our annual community festival or ComFest is held every year on the last weekend of June.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
I look forward to ComFest every year and it's usually the highlight of my summer.

01:56.000 --> 02:03.000
Unfortunately, this year my family is planning a family reunion in Kentucky during the ComFest weekend.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
I'm thinking of skipping the reunion in favor of ComFest at risk of disappointing my moms.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Do I fake sick?

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
Should I just suck it up and go to the reunion?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Oh, Mikey.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Dude, you can't skip.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
You can't skip ComFest.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Did you guys see the ComFest lineup this year?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Who they got?

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Who's blowing it up?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Oh my God.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
On the main stage.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
They got Black Diamond.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
They're on Who.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
They've got Major Lazer.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Okay.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Girl Talk.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
It's basically, they're replicating.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Are you making this up?

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
They're replicating the Burning Man 2007 lineup, which is a gold.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
That was the best one.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
That was totally the best one.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
ComFest looks bomb this year.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
That's what we're saying.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
What's the lineup at the family reunion?

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
Lineup at the family reunion is Uncle David.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
That's pretty much it.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
It's just Uncle David and his banjo.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
No, fuck that.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Go to ComFest, dude.

02:57.000 --> 03:04.000
I mean, your Uncle David's a competent banjo player, but you really can't, he's no Major Lazer.

03:04.000 --> 03:12.000
You'll be surprised at how quickly you'll forget about a bad family reunion, but if

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
something crazy goes down at ComFest.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
Have you thought about maybe merging the two events and inviting your family to ComFest?

03:20.000 --> 03:30.000
Be like, Uncle Dave's rolling on Molly over in the cool down tent.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
There's one important part here that we're forgetting, disappointing his mom, which makes

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
me think it's not really your decision, Mike.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
You might feel like it is, but it's not.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
This has already been made for you, Mike.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Have you considered kidnapping yourself?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Oh, shit.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Where did Mike go?

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
He was kidnapped to ComFest.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
I've always wanted to do that.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Black Diamond took him with his music.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
If I had to live like I was dying, like Tim McGraw says, that would be the only thing

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
I would do is pretend to have myself kidnapped.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
That's a good plan.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
It works.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
No skydiving, no Rocky Mountain climbing.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Mike, have yourself kidnapped.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Nationwide manhunt.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
It'll be a family reunion, but it'll be a family reunion based around praying for your

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
swift release.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
Just make sure that Denzel Washington isn't your bodyguard or else he'll probably kill

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
a lot of innocent people trying to find you.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Oh, man.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
I got to watch that movie.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Dope movie.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
I want to watch that right now.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
I'm getting off the podcast.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
I'm going to go watch that on fire.

04:28.000 --> 04:35.000
An anonymous user on FormSpring asks, I like my best guy friend, but I'm 95% sure he doesn't

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
like me like that.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
What do I do?

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
Well, I'm 95% sure you shouldn't do anything.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
You know, we get a lot of questions like that, and that is your boilerplate answer.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
Where is your romanticism, Travis?

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
I think that love conquers all.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Love is all.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
But this is like saying, I really want to eat a peanut butter sandwich, but I'm 95%

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
sure I'm allergic to peanuts.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
Well, that's a pretty hardy risk there to take.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
You know what I mean?

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
Risks are made to be took.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Plans are made to be broken.

05:12.000 --> 05:20.000
If it is truly your best guy friend, then don't fuck that up.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
I am a romantic.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Swallow those feelings.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Bottle them up.

05:26.000 --> 05:33.000
Yeah, if you're 95% sure, what has he done to you?

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
That means he spends 95% of the time you guys spend together, giving you the distinct impression

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
that he would not want to spend his life loving, laughing, living, and learning with you.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
Sarah, I'm having such a great time hanging out, but I would never ever date you, you

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
cow.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
I would never want to convert this to anything romantic, Sarah.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
Don't try and transform this into romance, you big animal.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
No, I just want to know if you want to go to the snow cone place.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Listen, don't make this about you.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
I said no strings.

06:03.000 --> 06:09.000
You should get a boyfriend that's not me, because, oh, I retched a little just even

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
thinking about it.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
I just retched on my chucks.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
You are a great friend, but a disgusting person.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Cow.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
I am sick when I look at you.

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
I've sickened, I'm the last single guy in my circle of friends, not me, and this is

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
Warm Spring again, and I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that all their wives slash girlfriends

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
profoundly dislike me.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
What can I do to cope with the awkward tension of any social gathering with my bros and

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
their hoes?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Don't.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Well, here's the suggestion.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
You want them to like you more.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
God, man, from the jump.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Let me help you.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Don't say hoes.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Yeah.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Go ahead and avoid that.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
Stop saying hoes, and then pack your bags and move away.

06:55.000 --> 07:02.000
You're not wanted there.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Imagine this.

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
One of the next questions we get is like, I love all my friends, and they have a great

07:09.000 --> 07:16.000
group of girlfriends, and we're all really close, but every once in a while, this zilch

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
comes around.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
None of us like.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
How do we awkwardly tell them to pack his bags and move away?

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
This guy sounds like a real Dupree.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Owen Wilson.

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
What I love about the question is he doesn't say, what can I do to stop the awkward tension?

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
He says, what can I do to cope with it?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
I know it's going to be there.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
I accept.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Ladies, I know this is weird.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
I get it.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Let's ride it out.

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
I know I'm a terrible person, and you hate me, but let's just deal with it.

07:46.000 --> 07:53.000
Yahoo Answers user Mr. Stinky Booty asks, do I even need to anymore?

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
No, keep going.

07:54.000 --> 08:03.000
He asks, my mom won't let me have a gun yet, and I want to hunt stuff.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
Can I just use an ax or a machete?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Yes, you can.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Oh my god.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Coolest kid ever.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Okay, there's some problems to address.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
One is the ambiguity, I think is the main problem.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
It's not that he, it's not the spore of hunting.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
It's that he doesn't need to kill, and he wants to kill stuff.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
Just whatever homes into his field of vision.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
He's going to kill it.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
I have to imagine that he's a younger person.

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
By the way, I refreshed the page to see if any good answers had come up,

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
and he has changed his name in the interim from when I loaded the page to when I refreshed the page

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
from Mr. Stinky Booty to True Survivor, which I think is pretty awesome.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
To Dr. Stinky Booty.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
He must have had a rough afternoon.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
I think if he is a child, I would say eight years old,

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
if you can manage to catch an animal in the wilderness and kill it with an ax,

09:02.000 --> 09:08.000
then I think he should be allowed to do that because it would be a real growing experience.

09:08.000 --> 09:14.000
Well, if he's eight, what kind of liberal mom has he got that's not letting him get a gun?

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
His index finger is working just fine.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
He needs to kill stuff.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
He needs to kill.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
And when you need something, that's a responsibility.

09:25.000 --> 09:32.000
Take living, breathing creatures and turn them into a pile of organic material.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Just start that degrading process.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
Hey, Food Size More wants to know on Twitter, he asked us,

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
is it ever appropriate to ask out your cute barista?

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Rarely.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
If you can accept that you're the 20th person that day to do it.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Yeah, cute barista is like begging for it.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Yeah.

09:51.000 --> 09:58.000
I think that there's something very safe about asking somebody who's in a service position.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
It's almost kind of creepy.

10:00.000 --> 10:08.000
They're already bringing you coffee, so maybe go off menu and ask them for their hand.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
I think it's a little weird.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
I'll take a date with you.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Can I get a grande dinner and a movie?

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
That's pretty good.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
Here's the thing to keep in mind, she's getting paid to be nice to you,

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
so it gets into a tricky kind of, is she really being nice to me,

10:24.000 --> 10:30.000
or is she doing her job kind of thing, and it's too precarious.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
I think it's too dangerous.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
I think we may have actually had this exact question in a prior episode.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
I think our answer then was, are you good looking?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Yes.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Are you a good looking dude?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
It's always appropriate.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
And it's always okay.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
When she asks you your name to put on the cup, say Mr. Stinky Booty,

10:49.000 --> 10:56.000
and then if she continues talking to you, she must really like you.

10:56.000 --> 11:02.000
9micor9, what?

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Yeah, you got it.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Okay, 9micor9 from Twitter says,

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
My friend Arthur has never been in a fight and always complains about it when he's intoxicated.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Should I punch him in the face?

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
Oh shit, we got the best game for you, dude.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
You and your friend Arthur need to play Lockjaw.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Yeah.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Lockjaw.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Here's what you do.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
You go to Arthur.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
You guys have both been drinking.

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
You put your fist six inches, this is important, from his face.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
Then you say, Lockjaw, Lockjaw, Lockjaw, like that.

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
And say it three times to give him plenty of warning for what's going to happen.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
And then you pop him.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
You pop him in the jaw.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
Now here's the important thing to think about this game is you take turns.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Right.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
You are going to get it back.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
So whatever you dole out, you will get back to you.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
I think Arthur's problem isn't that he's never been punched in the face.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
Because I think everyone in some way has been punched in the face.

12:01.000 --> 12:11.000
I think there's a difference between the controlled environment of Lockjaw and just a primal, just a rage fight.

12:11.000 --> 12:17.000
Just a cathartic, uncontrolled punch festival.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
I've never been in one.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
I got punched in the face one time when I was six years old by John Crider.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Because I cut in the four square line.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Asshole.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
God, I know.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
You were asking for it.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
I really was.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
And he was like seven feet tall.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
And he laid me right out.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Why did a teacher punch you?

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
No, he was an adult. He was a man child.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
I don't know.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
It was one of those jack deals.

12:43.000 --> 12:48.000
But I think you should probably punch your friend in his face.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Yeah.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
That's what I'm saying.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
We took the long way around.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
No harm could possibly come from this.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
He won't be upset too.

12:57.000 --> 13:02.000
Because then you can be like, hey, you asked about it.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Don't punch your friend in the face.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
What's the proper etiquette for the following situation, guys?

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Etiquette time.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Put your etiquette hats on.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Etiquette.

13:10.000 --> 13:18.000
I am walking one way, and a person passing me going the other way says something along the lines of, how are you doing?

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
Am I supposed to tell them how I am doing?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
That involves too much conversation.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
Plus then I feel required to ask them how they are.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
This can end up taking too much time.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
If I say nothing, then that is rude.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Am I supposed to just say it back?

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Oh, man.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Here's my suggestion.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
Turn around and start walking beside them and just start talking.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Well, I'm glad you asked.

13:45.000 --> 13:51.000
I've been having a rough day and just give them really personal details and teach them a lesson about being polite.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
I got this a lot in college.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
I'm sure everyone has.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
You got one of those faces.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Sure.

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
I mean, I knew a lot of people at my college, but I wasn't friends with a lot of people at my college.

14:03.000 --> 14:10.000
So I would be walking in a class and would pass somebody in the commons, as the kids say.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
And they would give me a, hey, what's up?

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
And there's no way that you can answer that question.

14:16.000 --> 14:21.000
You have to measure out the distance between you two, and are you supposed to slow down?

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Or do they really want to know what's up?

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Or is that just their way of saying hi?

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
So this is so pathetic, and you're going to think I'm joking, but it's totally the truth.

14:30.000 --> 14:36.000
If I ever saw somebody in the distance walking my way that I thought I knew, totally I would fake a phone call.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Oh.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Oh, yeah, I can't.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Sorry.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
It's my dentist.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
You know what?

14:41.000 --> 14:47.000
I would mock that, but I was about to say the most awkward thing is when you make eye contact from like 40 feet away,

14:47.000 --> 14:55.000
and then you have that entire 40 feet of walking at each other, where it's like, well, I've already acknowledged that I kind of know them,

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
and now I get a long time to not remember who they are.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Oh, but now I got this phone call.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
I'm going to just look at the ground because this conversation is so intense.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
I need to focus on my feet.

15:05.000 --> 15:12.000
Why don't you go with staring right in the eye, say, what do you care pervert?

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
And then push him down a well.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Or just say, what the fuck is that supposed to mean?

15:18.000 --> 15:23.000
Because what I'm saying to you is if you do that once, you will never have this problem again solved.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
Because they won't want to be your friend anymore.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Solved for good.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
Also, what you can do is just repeat their question back at them.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
They don't care.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
What is up?

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
How are you doing?

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
How are you doing?

15:37.000 --> 15:44.000
Yahoo Answers user Aisha asks, what is my body shape?

15:44.000 --> 15:52.000
She expounds on that initial question saying, I'm finding it really hard to know what my body shape is.

15:52.000 --> 16:03.000
I think I'm an hourglass, but then again, my measurements make me wonder if I am a spoon or even a rectangle.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
It's waist 31, hip 37, bust 37.5.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Not that that matters.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
The comedy in this situation.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Have you ever heard the term?

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
Yeah, she's got this fine little spoon frame.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Is it upside down spoon?

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
She's got herself a real tight rectangular chassis.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
She's got that dodecahedron going.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
You know what's up.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
She's got one of those figure eights.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
You know what I'm talking?

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Yeah, real good.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Little in the middle.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Here's my question.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Did she attach a picture?

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Profile.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
She's got a body like a pie symbol.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
The symbol for pie.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
She doesn't have a torso.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Just two wide legs.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Two wide legs, no torso.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Looking real good.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Is there a pic?

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Is there a picture?

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
No pics.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
No pics?

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
That's a random question to ask without people being able to see you.

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
That's like asking the question, what color shirt am I wearing?

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
That's something you would know better than me.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
Yeah, to answer your question, you're shaped like a stupid person.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Big, stupid refrigerator.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Big, stupid refrigerator.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
Open up the door, get some ass and pickles, and you're stupid still.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
Some of my coworkers have asked me to go out on a night out.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Okay, let me start again.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Some of my coworkers, I'll edit that out and post,

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
some of my coworkers have asked me to go on a night out,

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
but they want to go to a strip joint during the night.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Is there any way I can persuade them to do other stuff?

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Strip joints make me feel gross and pervy.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
Do you know why they make you feel gross and pervy?

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
Because people you don't know come and put their privates near,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
around, and on you.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
It is gross and pervy.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
It is legitimately gross and pervy.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
If you ever go to a strip joint and leave feeling classy and clean,

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
then you were not at a strip joint, my friend.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
You were at a burlesque show, perhaps.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
You were at an IHOP.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
You were at an AutoZone and you embarrassed yourself.

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
This is the weirdest strip joint ever, but these pancakes are delightful.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Wow, can I have some more cream?

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
What? Are you serious?

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
Yay. Here's the answer.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
You look them dead in the eyes and you tell them the stone truth

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
that they're your coworkers and you get paid to be around them.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
So unless someone's going to cut a check,

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
you're going to go home to your family who you love.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Yep.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
That's what I say.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
What if the strip joint is his family?

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Did you think about that?

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
The problem is the strippers are my real family.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
Well then, yeah, that's gross and pervy, my man.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Yeah, that's why you're so grossed out,

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
because that's your Aunt Deborah.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
You also got to consider, if you work at a Hallmark store

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
and your coworkers want to take you out to a strip joint,

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
how awkward is it going to be once you've seen them in that environment?

18:52.000 --> 18:57.000
Once you've seen Pamela get all messed up

18:57.000 --> 19:03.000
during kegs and eggs and legs Thursday mornings,

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
you can't look at her the same way ever again.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
Amateur night, what's up? Pamela, no.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Here's what you need to do.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Sue your business for sexual harassment.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
I've seen these videos.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
That's a classic example of sexual harassment.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Get paid, son.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
You know what you do with that money?

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Go to a strip joint.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Make it rain.

19:24.000 --> 19:29.000
To convince them to do something, to get out of this,

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
all you need to do is, when your coworker asks,

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
sit on their lap and say, I can just get it started right now.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
If I go to the strip club, I can bring the strip club to you.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Anyplace I go is a strip club.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Look at this zipper.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
It's halfway down just through this sentence.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
All my clothes are tearaway.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
I'm going to demonstrate, but they're not tearaway.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
See this suit? It's a nice suit, right? Watch this.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Rip.

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
I use the bus a lot, and I thought I could use that time

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
to practice my less-than-stellar social skills.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
How can I start a conversation with people

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
without coming off as either creepy or annoying?

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
I'd love to meet some new people to hang out with.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Yeah, this is a toughie.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
This is something that I have a lot of problems with sometimes,

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
is just seeing a stranger where you don't have a good opening,

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
and you might as well start a conversation.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
I mean, this is where the classics and sort of boring,

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
like how about this weather, kind of plays in.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
This is why people talk about the weather,

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
so it's always above you unless you're a spaceman,

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
and then you're just fucked.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
You know what? I actually have a trick

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
that I finally coined a phrase for,

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
and it's beautifully awkward.

20:38.000 --> 20:44.000
It's always going to be awkward, so acknowledge that.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
I went to a show the other day,

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
and there was this girl that was in the show

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
that came out afterwards, and I'm pretty sure I met her.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
I looked at her, and I said,

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
I don't know your name. I think I met you,

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
but I don't know your name.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
We were right out there and honest about it,

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
and we got into a conversation about how we couldn't remember each other.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
So you just confront the awkwardness full on.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Full on. That's the Travis approach.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Yeah. Just like if you're on the bus, just be like,

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
hey, I know it's creepy, but I just wanted to say I really like your shoes.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Or something like that, where you say,

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
hey, I didn't want to interrupt you, I didn't want to bother you,

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
but that's a great jacket.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
What if you try and pull that game, though,

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
and it's like, I think your face is familiar,

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
and I think that I know,

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
but I don't know how we are acquainted,

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
and then it's like, I am your aunt.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I'm your aunt.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
That's just a serious problem.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
You're putting singles into my G-string.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
This is awkward.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
What I normally end up doing,

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
I had to do a lot of this when I was working at the newspaper.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
I had to do a lot of man on the street interviews, stuff like that.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
Justin McElroy, the Justin McElroy you know,

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
with any luck love, internet gadabout,

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
media personality, cost celeb,

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
not cost celeb, I do have many cost celebs that I care about,

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
whales and things.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
I don't go up to people,

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
but I can pretend to be the sort of person that goes up to people.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
In my mind, just decide that you're that kind of person.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
That's not really you, but they don't know you,

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
so they don't know shit.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
They don't know anything about how awkward you are,

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
so you just trick them and pretend you're not an awkward person.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
Or put in those ear buds,

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
keep your eyes closed.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Here's the beautiful thing about the bus,

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
and any kind of situation like that,

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
you're only going to have to deal with that awkwardness

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
for like five minutes.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
It's a perfect time to practice doing that.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Yeah, you got an exit plan.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
If it fails, then you're quiet for the rest of the time.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
I don't think you can meet people though.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
I can't meet people.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
I'm moving to Chicago soon.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
I don't know how I'll be able to have the focus required

22:51.000 --> 22:56.000
to meet people when I know that I'm in an airtight tube

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
that's full of pathogens and maybe terrorists.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
You need a starter that you can always bring with you.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
A baby is good, or you can get a dog is good,

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
or you can get one of those giant pinwheel lollipops

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
and just in the bus just go to town on it.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
They're going to look because you're being so loud

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
with the slurping and licking, and when they look,

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
just be like, you want to get down on this?

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
And that's a great way to get down on this sucker with me.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
These right here, these are moon shoes.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
I want to get to know you.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Always carry skis with you.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
A bouncer.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
Yeah, I'm off to ski.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
I'm going to skiing mountain.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
Yahoo Answers user Dakota's Mommy asks,

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
help me name my mobile spray tanning business.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
Any suggestions would be appreciated.

23:51.000 --> 23:55.000
It is a spray tan business where I travel to your home.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
Please let me know what name you like the best.

23:59.000 --> 24:04.000
Caribbean tan to go, Caribbean tan to you,

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
tropical tan to you, tropical tan to go,

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
beach tan to go, beach tan to you,

24:10.000 --> 24:17.000
tropic tan to go, tropic tan to you.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
When I read this, I didn't read it very well, I guess,

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
and I just read the words mobile spray tanning business

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
and I thought of like a food truck.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
It would see these pale people on the street

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
and just like pull over and be like, hey,

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
just hop in this bus with really tinted windows

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
and take all of your clothes off and I'm going to spray you

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
with oils and you're going to be darker when you get out of it.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
It's basically just like a mobile rape den,

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
but I guess if it comes to your home.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
I think the important part about naming any business

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
is looking to the future, seeing how your business

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
is going to grow and change and kind of trying to anticipate that.

24:55.000 --> 25:01.000
So I recommend bankruptcy.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
How about casing the joint?

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
Let me in your house and I'll spray you with stuff.

25:08.000 --> 25:14.000
Dark skin spray, here it comes.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Dark soes.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
Van and tan.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
I don't think that we have a good one for her.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
I really don't want to give up on Dakota's mom

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
because she's had a hard year and I think she could use

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
any assistance we could afford her.

25:28.000 --> 25:38.000
How about you call it the Dakota Memorial spray tanning mobile station?

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
And then people say, oh, I'm so sorry, did your daughter die?

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
And you look them straight in the eye and say, someday.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
And then see if they still want to spray tan.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
I bet you they will want to look youthful and full of life

25:50.000 --> 25:54.000
and vigor more than they ever have before and you will be able

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
to really get them on the add-ons.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Like the complimentary fake teeth.

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
How about spray tan for shut-ins?

26:04.000 --> 26:10.000
Because they can't get the UV rays, the vitamin D

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
that you really need to get a good base going.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
So I think that maybe you should just put your target audience

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
right in the name.

26:17.000 --> 26:24.000
I say name it all over tan, which has a double euphemism there,

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
a double entendre, where one, you're all over the city,

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
you're traveling, but also that awkward moment where they have

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
to get naked in front of you.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
So just all over tan.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
That's copyrighted.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Hey guys.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
Oh yeah, sorry.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
Hi gentlemen.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
I live in Connecticut and I just started dating a guy in NYC.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
I'm gay, by the way.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Ew.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Come on, come on.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
We were all thinking that.

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
We get along great and I think this has some real potential.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Congratulations.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Okay.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
The only mismatch is that he likes to go out all the time

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
and I'm more of a homebody.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
How can I make this work?

27:03.000 --> 27:07.000
Wow, I have that exact, I have had that exact same problem

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
in my relationship.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
I feel like we've kind of dealt with it.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
You dated a dude in New York City?

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Yep.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
No, Griffin.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
I've been a homebody.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
I am someone who likes to stay at home.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
I don't like to go out.

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
And Sydney, especially when we were still in college,

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
she liked to go out a lot.

27:24.000 --> 27:30.000
And what's hard is that for all the things in relationships

27:30.000 --> 27:35.000
where like you want to be with somebody that you click with,

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
inevitably there's going to be something that is just,

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
it's endemic to who you are and it's not going to change

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
and it's not complimentary with your partner.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Be that man or woman.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
You're going to find things like that in a relationship

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
and the best thing to do is not to hope that it gets better.

27:55.000 --> 27:59.000
The best thing to do is to confront it like grownups

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
and say I feel differently than you do,

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
but let's work it out.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Let's go out three nights a week and stay in three nights a week.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
You're going to have to give and he's going to have to give.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
And the good news is that it's perfect.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
I think that that is the perfect setup

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
because if you both wanted to go out all the time,

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
that would get old and if you were both homebodies

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
and wanted to stay home all the time, that would get old.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
This way you can kind of split the difference

28:24.000 --> 28:28.000
and it's a better match than you think

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
because if you were both one or the other,

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
it gets really old.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
I'm kind of in a similar situation but roles reversed

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
where I like to go out and Teresa likes to stay home

28:39.000 --> 28:43.000
and so there's nights when she's not feeling it

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
and I'm like all right, great, we'll stay home

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
and we'll watch Avatar and hang out

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
and then there's nights where I really want to go out

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
and she's like all right, let's go

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
and it's a compromise kind of situation.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
I go out and stay home on my own damn schedule.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
All right.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
And sad.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
And this has been the Lonely Heart Corner with Griffin.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
It's a regular feature on the show.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
Go to sleep earlier, you dummy.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Let's lonely times.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
So here's the deal.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Let me give it to you straight, Griff.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
Back in February, I met a girl who's with the Marine Corps.

29:17.000 --> 29:23.000
At that time, I was in the process of joining but hadn't yet.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
You guys know that I know his pronounced core right now.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
I don't think they appreciate it when you actually say the words

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
in conjunction with each other.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
Yeah, together they weren't, I didn't map it out.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
I needed to think about that a little bit more.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Thank you for your service.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
We became friends and I started liking her.

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
Now I've sworn into the USMC and it turns out she likes me.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
But if we get into a relationship,

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
it could technically be considered fraternization.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
What should I do?

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Tristan.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
That's some hot shit.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Man, this sounds like a Richard Gere movie.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
I love it.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
Sounds like a...

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
This is scintillating.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Danielle Steel.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Court-martial at the heart.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Heartbreak on the waves.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
An officer and an officer.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Of differing genders.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Important to note.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Not that there's anything wrong with that,

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
especially love on the high seas.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
You find out where you can get it, right?

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
Did you join the USMC to be closer?

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
Because if so, you did not plan this shit out, my man.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
I'll say this.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
This is friend of the show, Tristan.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
He is dedicated to serving our country.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
I've been talking to him for a while now

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
about his dedication to the country.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Thanks again, Tristan.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Doing a bang-up job of it.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
You're doing great.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Yeah, go ahead and fraternize.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
Hey, how about this?

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
How about this, Tristan?

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
We're at war.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
How about you put your mind on your duty?

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
No, no.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
To protect me and my freedom.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Dude, listen.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Tristan is doing something.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
I listen.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
The three of us could never do.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
I have a busy schedule,

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
and I need people to protect me day in and day out.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
And Tristan is thinking about swoopin' Poon,

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
and I need him to be thinking about swoopin' Osama

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
and getting him into the tunnels and go get him.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
But with that constant...

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
He might be on the water.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
That's why we haven't found him.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
With that constant, beautiful reminder

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
of swoopable Poon right next to him

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
as he's fighting side by side

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
against Osama's evil forces, against the axis of evil,

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
he's gonna fight that much harder

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
because he knows he has something to protect,

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
and so will she.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
I'm saying that if anyone's gonna take down Osama,

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
it's gonna be Tristan or his girlfriend, Isolde.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
And by which I mean anyone.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Personally, Tristan will be the one,

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
and that will make the end of that movie so much better.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Tristan's gonna take him down.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
His girlfriend's gonna hold the camera up

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
while he is hog-tying him.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
He's gonna make Osama bin Laden say,

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
my brother, my brother, and me is the best podcast.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
What if you only have time, though?

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
What if he's put into the classic Batman situation?

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
Oh, God.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
You know, where it's like...

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
He has to either save our podcasters, girlfriend...

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
If you go this way, you can capture Osama

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
and promote my brother, my brother, and me.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
If you go the other way, you'll save your girlfriend.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
What do you do?

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
I didn't think about it like that.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
I trust Tristan to figure out the correct choice.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Yeah.

32:25.000 --> 32:29.000
Which is, I think you throw the girlfriend at Osama.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
Yeah.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
And then you shoot him...

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
You shoot Osama, and it's like...

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
You take it, but you wing him, right?

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
And you take him in.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
You're a hero, and who cares who you fraternize with?

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
This is the solution.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
Catch Osama, and you can fraternize with whoever the fuck you want.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
I love it.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
You're a national hero.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
I already think he's a national hero.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
Okay, okay.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
You just go ahead and do whatever you want, Tristan.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
Yeah.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
Ain't no law against it.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
There might actually be...

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Except for the laws that are definitely against it.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
I think there actually is.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
I will grant you regional hero at this point,

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
but not like a national, like global hero,

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
except to people who hate our country.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
It's my hero.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
P-dunk.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Not a good start, but keep going.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
Hey, guys.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
Is it wrong to be in a long-term relationship with a girl,

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
even though you know it's not going to be a happily ever after kind of thing?

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
And if so, how long is too long?

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
P-dunk, why are you wasting your time?

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Yeah.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
Why are you wasting her time?

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
Yeah.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
Boo, yeah.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
Does she know?

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
Yeah, that's the thing.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
I think that might be step one,

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
and then maybe we can plan out a future after that.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Let me give you that future.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Living alone.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
No, you guys are living in the future.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
P-dunk, you got to live in the present.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
If you're having a good time with her,

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
even though you know that it's, you know,

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
she ain't marriage material, or maybe you're not.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
That doesn't make any sense.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
But the problem, Griffin, is long-term relationship.

33:45.000 --> 33:49.000
It's one thing to go on a couple dates with a girl knowing it's not going to work out.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
It's another to be with a girl for like a year and a half,

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
but sitting there thinking, well, this is going to end in February.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
Like, we've talked about this before.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
Once you make that decision that this isn't going anywhere,

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
you're never coming back from that.

34:03.000 --> 34:09.000
And he could miss out on like the special somebody of his life

34:09.000 --> 34:14.000
because he's dating this spoon-shaped harpy.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
P-dunk, I'm going to be just brutally honest here.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
I would call that behavior selfish because it's saying,

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
I don't want to be alone right now,

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
and then I'll keep my options open if something else comes along.

34:27.000 --> 34:32.000
So should we break up with P-dunk's girlfriend for him right now on the show?

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Oh, God, yeah, our first breakup.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
Hey, Margaret.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
Hey, Margie.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Hey, spoon-shaped harpy.

34:38.000 --> 34:43.000
Listen, we don't know anything about you except that you don't make our boy P-dunk happy enough.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
You are a marriage material, my babe.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
Sorry.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
You've done good.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
You've put in a good effort.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
But your 100% just wasn't good enough for the dunk.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
And you know what?

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
All the pressure off him, he didn't say a word to us.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
We made this decision after observing how you guys were together.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
So don't be mad at him, be mad at us.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
And Margot, you can do better.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
He calls himself P-dunk unironically.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
Is that the kind of guy you want to take home to meet your folks?

35:09.000 --> 35:14.000
You can't do better, though, because P-dunk is, I mean, he's a solid dude.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
He's a good dude.

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
He helped me move, gave me a ride to the airport.

35:19.000 --> 35:25.000
So you just got to come and pack up your shit.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
I have a conundrum.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
Okay.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
This is from Stacy.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
Here are my brother and my brother and me.

35:30.000 --> 35:35.000
We turn conundrums into funundrums with our advice.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
My brother and I, my boyfriend and I.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Yowza.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Yowza.

35:40.000 --> 35:45.000
My boyfriend and I are celebrating our three-year anniversary in a week or so.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
You should know that.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Maybe you want to pin down that date, Stace.

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
Unfortunately, I'm far away in grad school and dealing with crazy family times.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
This is where you come in.

35:54.000 --> 35:58.000
I need ideas for gifts, and I am certain he would love anything you suggested.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
Well, shit, Stacy.

35:59.000 --> 36:03.000
Thanks for telling us so very much about him to base this decision on.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
So like an object, a physical object in the world.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
A gun rack.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
Let's just, let's just.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
A mug, a nice mug.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
A segue.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
A printer.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
A chalice.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
A lamp.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
A guitar tuner.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
I'm looking at things on my desk.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
A jar of jawbreakers.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
I'm just looking at things.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
A leg lamp.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
You know what's good?

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
A guitar.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
Not just a gift, but a hobby.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
You know?

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Here's the important thing.

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
What about a high-quality webcam for both you and him, and then you can have video chats.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
I like that.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
From far away from each other.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
I think that that's good.

36:39.000 --> 36:44.000
On any anniversary gift, the important thing is to, it's a test.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
To prove how well you know them.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
It is.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
So get them something.

36:49.000 --> 36:54.000
Get your bow something that is specific to him.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Get him a bowstaff!

36:56.000 --> 37:00.000
Get him a crossbow with which he can blink in the wild.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
A crossbow that shoots bowstaffs.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
A giant bow shooting crossbow.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
A bow crossbow.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
A bow crossbow.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
A ballista.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
A crossbow that shoots bows.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
A barista.

37:14.000 --> 37:18.000
A crossbow that shoots baristas, and then you go to jail for murder.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
Because you just shot a Starbucks employee.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Why did you do that?

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Stacy, that was the worst present ever.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
I got you this dead Starbucks employee.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
I got you a boom rat for murder.

37:30.000 --> 37:34.000
You're going to want to leave the country.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
No, I think the webcam's a car.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Three year, that's a car, right?

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Three year's the car.

37:40.000 --> 37:44.000
Fourth year's the dead stuff.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
I want to ask a question.

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
Well, someone else asked it, but I want to read it.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
It's from a website called Yahoo.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
User Just Another Human asked,

37:55.000 --> 38:00.000
Is it weird to like animated characters more than real life people?

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
Let's say a cartoon figure, I think.

38:03.000 --> 38:07.000
Depending on the cartoon, some females look astonishingly beautiful.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
And usually they have a great personality.

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
I start to imagine how it would be to date such a character.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
And the outcome is, it's better than real life.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
I don't really like real life females much.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
Most of them, not all, are really superficial.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
And usually just want something from you.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
Don't misunderstand.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
I can clearly see the line between fantasy and real life.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
It's just that fantasy is so much more appealing to me.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Hey, buddy.

38:32.000 --> 38:36.000
Can we talk about, like, okay,

38:36.000 --> 38:40.000
your problem with women is that they're superficial.

38:40.000 --> 38:44.000
And you're telling me you're attracted to celluloid people.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
I'm in love with Warcraft Avatar.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
I like how they're only two dimensional,

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
and they don't talk back.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
And I can turn it off.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
That's pretty nice.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
And they're glossy.

38:56.000 --> 39:01.000
If this guy finds out that those things were animated by real life people,

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
and written dialogue by real life people,

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
and voiced by real life people, he's going to lose his shit.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
Please, nobody tell him that.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
Here's the funny thing.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
This is the Yahoo Answers equivalent of the neighbor who says,

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
he always seemed like such a nice boy.

39:15.000 --> 39:19.000
Like, this is step one to ten years down the road,

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
he's killing women.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
That's what the internet teaches us, right?

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
It's not that he was always such a nice guy.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
It's that you never read his posts on Yahoo Answers.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Trust me, he was a monster the whole time.

39:31.000 --> 39:35.000
Real people are just too, they're like big sacks of blood.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
Don't you just want to stab them and see what's inside?

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
Is that weird?

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Here's a pro tip, bro.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
If you have to ask, is it weird?

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
Yes.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Odds are problems.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
If you have to make the statement,

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
I can clearly see the line between reality and fantasy,

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
you can't.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
You can't see that line.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
You are justifying.

39:53.000 --> 39:57.000
And you know it's bad when dude is like,

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
I'm so crazy, but I'm going to step out of that.

40:00.000 --> 40:04.000
It's gotten to a point where I can actually sense my own perversion,

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
like rearing its head.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Like, I don't think this is normal.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
I'm pretty sure it's weird.

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
But that's how weird it is, that like even me, a weird guy,

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
is like, I don't know, Ken.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
I'm going to be honest with you guys.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
I am freaking myself out.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
I'm freaking out by me, just me being alone.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
I'm freaked.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
So hopefully that'll help you, Kev.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Kevmo.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
You are a weird guy.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
Creepy Kev.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
I want to hear our last question, our one to grow on, if you will.

40:30.000 --> 40:35.000
But first I want to tell you how you can seek out our advice.

40:35.000 --> 40:41.000
Oh, hold on.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
I got a good one here.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
From Delia.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
I'm 22 and a hopeless romantic.

40:47.000 --> 40:51.000
I've been blown away, not in a good way, from the desires of men that I meet.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
I don't see why it's so hard for a guy to take a girl out,

40:53.000 --> 40:57.000
or at least open a door for her, buy a beer or dinner.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
They all just want to screw and fool around.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Why are you separating them?

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
Do they mean different things than I thought they meant?

41:04.000 --> 41:08.000
They just want to have sex and then put on clown costumes.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
I'm not saying that it's a bad thing, lol.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
I'm not looking for a serious relationship.

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
But why have men thought that dinner or drinks is no longer necessary?

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
It's making my loving heart sad.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
Keeping the ears open.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
Loving you three.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Delia.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Delia has a strange way of talking.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
But I dig it.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
I'm just saying.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
I dig it.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
It's strange.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
But I dig it.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
I don't know, Delia.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Chivalry is dead.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
Go to a church, Delia.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
That's where you're going to meet a nice boy.

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
Go to our Facebook appreciation group and meet a nice boy.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
All gentlemen.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
There are still gentlemen in the world.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
I open a door.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
Here's why.

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
Those kinds of guys will do as little as they have to do.

41:50.000 --> 41:57.000
So, you know, make sure you keep your standards strong and require them to do these things.

41:57.000 --> 42:02.000
And they will do them or just go out with a better quality of man.

42:02.000 --> 42:06.000
And keep in mind, 22 guys, 22, they're basically children.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
They're like babies.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
They don't know real skills like a man.

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
They really don't start to ripen and mature as a person until 23.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
That's true.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
Take it.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
Yeah.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
Yeah.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
Take it from Griffin.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
Delia, date older men.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
Yeah.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Date older men that go to church.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
Just go to your local church.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
Find the oldest guy you can.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
Jack up.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
Get hitched.

42:28.000 --> 42:32.000
Make sure he's got some do-re-mi in the back though, if you know what I mean.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Can't buy the cow and milk it.

42:34.000 --> 42:38.000
And then you drink the milk and make you strong and then you kick a dude.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
I think I messed up the metaphor.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
Yeah, I think so.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
I want to hear Griffin's laugh.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
Also, Delia, I'm confused by your email.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
Are you down to bone?

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
Because...

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Or do you want to fool around?

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
That's all that I was getting.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
You know what?

42:51.000 --> 42:58.000
It may be that you are sending out the wrong signals that you're down to bone on the 24th

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
set.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
Maybe you should scale it back a little bit.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
Maybe wear something more conservative.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
Go ahead and lock that up.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
That's your treasure.

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
Maybe when you meet a new person, this is a great way to meet somebody on the bus.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
Hi, my name is Delia and I'm not down to bone.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
Yes.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
So don't even try it.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
Don't even try it.

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
But do you like Scrabble?

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
Because I will play some Scrabble with you tonight.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
I will play Scrabble.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
Or your tiles.

43:24.000 --> 43:28.000
The road to passion is on lockdown, if you know what I'm saying.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
That's not even a metaphor.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
It's just on lockdown.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
But then feel free to give it up on second date.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
Second date.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
I think you got to go naked date, too.

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
I want to hear the last question in actuality now.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
I'm not just threatening to hear it.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
But I want to tell you how you can seek out our advice.

43:46.000 --> 43:51.000
As always, these messages are available on mybrotherandmybrotherandme.com, which is not

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
a website.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
M-B-M-B-A-M.com is.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
Glad to say this has been a really well oiled show.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
Really.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Yeah, really working the kinks out for sure.

44:00.000 --> 44:05.000
Well, we've all been burning the candles at both ends and a little bit in the middle.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
Yeah.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
So just bear with it.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Yeah, just hang in there.

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
You can get us on Twitter.

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
Use the hashtag M-B-M-B-A-M.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
We read all those always.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
We see them as soon as you say them.

44:17.000 --> 44:20.000
If you want to get to us directly, that's a great way to do it.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
At M-B-M-B-A-M is our Twitter account.

44:22.000 --> 44:26.000
If you want to find out what's new, what's the latest.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
Want to make a love connection or maybe just meet a friend.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
Go to our Facebook group.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Huge thread on Facebook.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Huge thread on Facebook about meetings.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
Is it really?

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Yeah, it's blowing up.

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
If you want to go there, just meet people, make a new friend.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
There's no evidence of actual...

44:43.000 --> 44:50.000
I haven't seen any evidence of kids swapping tartar sauce yet, but I'm hoping in the near,

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
near future.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
You want them to get down and swap it.

44:52.000 --> 44:55.000
And it goes without saying, picks only, no fatties.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
Picks only, please.

44:57.000 --> 45:01.000
We're professionals here, providing a professional service.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Thank you so much.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
Thank you.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
Yeah.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
You guys have been so great.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
Everything is growing.

45:07.000 --> 45:11.000
It's on the G-R-O-W tip.

45:11.000 --> 45:15.000
Every day we are expanding our reach, our influence.

45:15.000 --> 45:22.000
We've been in the top 20 on iTunes for the last, episode wise, for the last two weeks.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
Have we?

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
Yeah.

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
We also want to remind you, as always, to not do anything that we say to do.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
Don't listen to a...

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
God damn word.

45:30.000 --> 45:33.000
But do tell a friend.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
Tell a friend.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
Burn a CD.

45:35.000 --> 45:40.000
You can fit two episodes of our show on a CD and you can give that to a friend.

45:40.000 --> 45:45.000
Subscribe to the podcast on iTunes, drop a review.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
Whatever.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
You know what we need.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Just give it to us, Delia.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
We need your love.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
We need your love, please.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
Your treasure.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
It's the second date.

45:55.000 --> 45:59.000
Griffin, what's our last question?

45:59.000 --> 46:03.000
This question comes to us from Christian.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Just Christian.

46:05.000 --> 46:13.000
Who asks, what is Justin Bieber's cell phone number?

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
I'm Justin McElroy.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
I'm Travis McElroy.

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
I'm Justin Bieber.

46:19.000 --> 46:23.000
My Bieber, my Bieber and me.

46:23.000 --> 46:52.000
You never know me.

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
You never know me.
