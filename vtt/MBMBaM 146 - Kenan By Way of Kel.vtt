00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:50.320
Beat beat, all aboard, money car. Why is that car so small? We can't fit,

00:50.320 --> 00:54.800
we can't fit more than like three people in a car. As the trolley pulling into the station,

00:54.800 --> 00:58.720
it's made of money. How about this? I like this, I like this analogy better.

00:58.720 --> 01:01.920
Ticket please, because you've been riding our comedy train for three fucking years,

01:03.040 --> 01:06.560
and if you don't hand me that ticket, we're going to throw you off. We'll ban your IP.

01:07.200 --> 01:12.720
Hey, it's me, the Piper. What's up? Hey, Piper's here. It's me, Piper Parabo.

01:12.720 --> 01:17.920
Time to pay for your favorite comedy podcast. Thanks, Billy Piper. Sincerely,

01:17.920 --> 01:22.800
celebrity endorser, Billy Piper. This is Billy Maze. Billy Maze here for a new product

01:22.800 --> 01:28.320
that you've been using for three years. Come back from the dead. I'm a spectral form now

01:28.320 --> 01:31.920
to tell you you've been listening to this podcast for three years. Time to chunk up the change.

01:31.920 --> 01:35.920
Is that it? Time to chunk up the change with my brother, my brother, me,

01:35.920 --> 01:43.360
special pledge drive podcast. It's time to pay the Piper. We got a big show for you today. We bet

01:44.320 --> 01:50.880
as we record it, I'm sure its size will be revealed to us. It seems like it will be big.

01:50.880 --> 01:58.720
Do you guys want to say anything on the podcast? Guys, thank you so much for your support because

01:58.720 --> 02:03.360
I'm assuming that you heard on Twitter that it was Max Fun Drive Time and you immediately clicked

02:03.360 --> 02:07.920
the link and you immediately just dropped, you just immediately junked us right there,

02:07.920 --> 02:13.120
right there on the spot. You plonked it down, a big one. I also appreciate you, I assume,

02:13.120 --> 02:20.560
choosing MBMBAM as your favorite podcast on the website, and then tweeting about it and telling

02:20.560 --> 02:25.840
all your friends that they should be ashamed of themselves for not doing the same. We just jumped

02:25.840 --> 02:30.720
right into it. Look, the Max Fun Drive, if you are a new listener, this is our third go round

02:30.720 --> 02:42.080
with the drive with the Pledger. It's a two week long event that our parent company sets up. It is

02:42.080 --> 02:48.000
a fundraiser. You can help support us and other amazing shows on the Max Fun Network. We do extra

02:48.000 --> 02:52.720
super length episodes. We have bonus content. We have pledge gifts. We're going to get to all that

02:52.720 --> 02:56.400
and more, but it's a special time. It's a special time to be part of the Max Fun family.

02:56.400 --> 03:02.560
That boy, Griffin, you said a mouthful, and this year is like none other. We've got a ton

03:02.560 --> 03:06.640
of great pledge gifts to tell you about, but there's going to be time for all that.

03:06.640 --> 03:10.320
First, let's just get into the advice. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.400
I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

03:12.400 --> 03:18.320
I'm your sweet baby, Griffin McElroy. This week's show, I'm going to say all the syllables wrong.

03:19.200 --> 03:27.360
Let's get the first kuyuyo. I'm 26. I have a degree in animation, but I decided a year ago

03:27.360 --> 03:33.600
that it just wasn't what I wanted to do. I've begun a track for computer science programming,

03:33.600 --> 03:40.480
but thoughts of my ever nearing death have had me thinking of other ways to spend the remaining days

03:40.480 --> 03:45.360
on this sweet earth. I've always wanted to be a pilot, specifically flying helicopters,

03:45.360 --> 03:49.600
but training is expensive and the career path takes quite some time to move up.

03:49.600 --> 03:54.720
Should I go even further into that to chase my dream, or should I follow the money and

03:54.720 --> 03:59.040
spend the rest of my days in a cubicle? That's from feeling shackled in Chicago.

04:00.160 --> 04:05.040
I am in no way being flippant what jobs are there for a helicopter pilot.

04:05.040 --> 04:12.240
Oh yeah, there's hospital guy. You could work for park rangers,

04:12.240 --> 04:16.240
for when idiot Aaron Ralston's out there get pinned.

04:17.760 --> 04:22.960
You could go with news chopper guy. News chopper guy is one.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.520
Another one is- Oh, army man. Army guy. Army man.

04:27.520 --> 04:29.360
Army man. Tourist guy.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.720
Oh yeah, tourist guy like volcano guy. That would probably be the sweetest,

04:32.720 --> 04:41.680
most lending itself to a USA action drama or action comedy drama in the vein of Psyker Burn Notice.

04:41.680 --> 04:45.200
Kevin Costner, both of those by the way, just got picked up by the Esquire Network.

04:45.200 --> 04:50.560
Pretty cool network you got going on there Esquire. What was that fucking movie with Ash

04:50.560 --> 04:56.960
Ashcon, Ash Kutcher, sorry it was Ash Kutch and it had Kevin Costner and they were people

04:56.960 --> 05:00.080
in helicopter and then people would be drowning in the ocean and they would get them.

05:00.080 --> 05:03.680
It was Dive Buddies. Dive Buddies.

05:03.680 --> 05:07.200
With Ash Ash and Kutcher. You could be one of him.

05:07.200 --> 05:10.720
So yeah, it doesn't seem like there are a lot of career ops. It seems like a lot of people would

05:10.720 --> 05:14.960
want to do that. It seems like one of those jobs that maybe you don't get paid basically anything

05:14.960 --> 05:17.920
because everyone's like, yeah, you get to be in a helicopter all day.

05:17.920 --> 05:20.240
That's life's greatest reward. Oh fucking, you can be-

05:20.880 --> 05:25.520
Man, I bet you bachelor employs so many people.

05:25.520 --> 05:30.720
Oh my God. Yeah. What if you started your own like limousine style helicopter business?

05:30.720 --> 05:34.640
That's probably not legal, is it? I will take you to prom, the helicopter business.

05:35.520 --> 05:38.960
Does your high school have a landing pad? No? Fuck it. We'll improvise.

05:39.840 --> 05:45.520
How are you? How are you at halos? How are you at high altitude landing operations?

05:47.600 --> 05:50.800
Have I got some high altitude opportunities for you?

05:50.800 --> 05:55.600
If you don't capitalize on these opportunities, you are going to have unbroken legs.

05:58.800 --> 06:05.200
I think that you should, as far as your actual question, I can't, I mean-

06:06.320 --> 06:09.920
We usually say like follow your bliss, but- It sounds like you're doing that too much.

06:10.480 --> 06:13.440
Maybe you need to pick something that's your bliss and just chase that.

06:13.440 --> 06:19.360
This bliss sounds fucking dope though. Is it something you could do like pilot

06:19.360 --> 06:23.360
lessons where you could like be an amateur helicopter pilot, but maybe that's not like

06:23.360 --> 06:27.600
your career path, but like you have a license to do it. You could do it if you wanted to,

06:27.600 --> 06:32.240
but it's not your day job. Is that crazy? Is that a thing you think?

06:32.240 --> 06:35.760
You're talking about recreation. It's not like fucking like pottery.

06:35.760 --> 06:38.560
It's not like you build an attachment in your garage.

06:38.560 --> 06:41.920
You can do that as a pilot. You can go to like a small airport and like

06:41.920 --> 06:45.600
get your pilot's license, even if you're not like a commercial airline pilot.

06:45.600 --> 06:48.320
Hold on. Hold on. That's something you can do?

06:48.320 --> 06:53.760
Yeah. Guys, I've had fun doing this podcast,

06:53.760 --> 06:56.400
but I just got a new hobby. Peace.

06:56.960 --> 07:02.240
I got a hobby in the fucking clouds now. So you're saying he should be a computer

07:02.240 --> 07:05.520
scientist who, as a hobby, helicopters. Yeah.

07:06.160 --> 07:09.520
I think that could eat up a lot of his- Oh, it's not cheap.

07:10.320 --> 07:13.680
You gotta feed and house the helicopter, which is already expensive.

07:14.480 --> 07:17.600
And you never own your own helicopter, right? No, you gotta lease it.

07:17.600 --> 07:20.240
Yeah. If you don't take good care of your helicopter,

07:20.240 --> 07:22.560
the helicopter social services will come by and be like,

07:22.560 --> 07:24.560
oh, come here, little buddy. What did he do to you?

07:25.200 --> 07:28.800
What have they been feeding you? I've seen Helicopter Cops Houston,

07:28.800 --> 07:32.400
and it is some messed up shit down there. I was thinking of cattle.

07:33.200 --> 07:38.000
I got helicopters confused with cattle again. It sounds like helicopter pilot sounds like fun,

07:38.000 --> 07:40.640
but it doesn't really sound like a career that you want to do.

07:40.640 --> 07:44.480
It sounds like you just want to kind of fly helicopters, which is also fine.

07:44.480 --> 07:50.000
But I don't think that you should bail on the... You don't have to make it your career.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.200
You can just be a guy that also flies helicopters. I have an idea.

07:53.200 --> 07:56.160
It seems like a safer plot. What if you were a dude

07:56.160 --> 08:00.400
who did the computer science and programming for helicopters?

08:00.400 --> 08:05.360
Okay. What if you worked for an aerospace company

08:05.360 --> 08:07.680
that made helicopters? Holy shit.

08:07.680 --> 08:13.120
You program the artificial intelligence of the airwolf helicopter.

08:13.120 --> 08:16.800
Nightrider 2. Nightrider, Skyrider, Cloudrider.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.960
Skyrider, Cloudrider. Oh, there it is.

08:18.960 --> 08:23.600
It's my new show. It's called Airwolf 2 Nightrider colon Skyrider.

08:24.640 --> 08:30.800
Comma Cloudrider. And it stars a guy who's a computer scientist

08:30.800 --> 08:35.360
that programs an AI for a helicopter and also makes a cartoon

08:35.360 --> 08:38.400
about the helicopter that he draws. And he's a billionaire.

08:38.400 --> 08:41.760
He's a billionaire. And also he has sex with all kinds of people all the time.

08:41.760 --> 08:45.200
So look out for... Like keep it locked to UPN.

08:45.200 --> 08:50.080
Keep it on the Esquire channel. Can we put some tits on that helicopter?

08:51.360 --> 08:53.840
Done. I got another question for you guys.

08:53.840 --> 08:56.560
I'm taking talking... Fuck!

08:56.560 --> 09:02.320
I'm talking to my friend who is a lady and she came to me feeling bummed out.

09:02.880 --> 09:06.800
I tried to cheer her up just by being positive and making her laugh.

09:07.520 --> 09:11.360
And although she did laugh, she seemed slightly annoyed for a second.

09:11.360 --> 09:17.840
Is there a certain chemistry between people who are feeling depressed

09:17.840 --> 09:20.880
and those who are trying to cheer them up that creates bad tension?

09:21.440 --> 09:25.120
Or could I be experiencing a taste of schadenfreude?

09:26.160 --> 09:27.920
It's from Gmail. Schadenfreude.

09:27.920 --> 09:34.400
Man, I long for a lifestyle where I can think this much about what other people feel.

09:34.400 --> 09:38.400
This seems like you're a really considerate person and I wish I had that inclination.

09:38.400 --> 09:43.040
You're saying you fucking witnessed a micro-expression on this person's face.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.440
You need to get in the police interrogation biz.

09:45.440 --> 09:49.600
Yeah, he smiled, but his eyes for a millisecond were so angry

09:49.600 --> 09:52.160
and that's how I knew he was lying about the treasure.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.320
Hey guys, side note, because it just occurred to me.

09:54.320 --> 09:59.360
Do you think in countries like England where they say bum for butt,

09:59.360 --> 10:03.840
the word bummed out means something completely different and really dirty?

10:03.840 --> 10:08.720
It means you hump their butt so hard the inside of their butt comes to be the outside of their butt.

10:09.520 --> 10:12.000
She was really bummed out, if you know what I mean.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.080
She was bummed out so hard that she died.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.760
Why do you make it tragic?

10:17.760 --> 10:21.120
She died from bum loss. It was awful.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.280
Listen guys, time loss is bum loss.

10:23.280 --> 10:23.760
Exactly.

10:25.440 --> 10:28.720
I think, here's one that I had to learn the hard way.

10:28.720 --> 10:35.600
Okay, sometimes when your friend or significant other comes to you

10:35.600 --> 10:42.720
and is upset or depressed or angry, sometimes they don't want to be cheered up.

10:42.720 --> 10:43.360
I know exactly what you're saying.

10:43.360 --> 10:50.240
Sometimes they just want you to say that it is in fact shitty what is going on.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.160
Sometimes they just want to vent.

10:52.160 --> 10:54.800
Sometimes they just want to know that what they did was right,

10:54.800 --> 10:56.720
because like when you're trying to cheer them up and be like,

10:56.720 --> 11:00.000
hey man, it's going to be okay, they're like, yeah, I know it's going to fucking be okay.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.160
I'm an adult who knows the situation.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.920
I'm just saying it sucked at this time.

11:03.920 --> 11:08.560
The idea though for us, specifically for the three of us and our fam and growing up,

11:08.560 --> 11:12.240
coming up McElroy, coming up McElroy, the new name of the podcast.

11:12.240 --> 11:14.160
Coming to Esquire channel.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.480
Coming up McElroy, three zany bros.

11:17.920 --> 11:23.440
The idea of something being not a laughing matter was incomprehensible.

11:23.440 --> 11:30.160
Obviously if somebody's like, yeah, basically my whole family just died.

11:30.160 --> 11:31.520
I wouldn't be like, oh, well.

11:31.520 --> 11:32.800
Time to Batman.

11:32.800 --> 11:36.000
Sometimes that is actually a fear in my life that I'll make a joke like that

11:36.000 --> 11:41.280
and just everyone in the room will slowly turn to me horrified and be like, why would you say that?

11:41.280 --> 11:43.040
Our podcast is just an hour of that.

11:44.240 --> 11:44.800
I don't know.

11:44.800 --> 11:49.520
I'm really bad at that when somebody is really pissed off about something and I'd be like,

11:49.520 --> 11:54.160
yeah, well at least here's a joke about Ryan Lochte and then they'll be like, this isn't

11:55.360 --> 11:56.640
that that I wanted.

11:56.640 --> 11:57.760
I wanted something different.

11:57.760 --> 12:01.440
I find it best that when someone comes to me bummed out, just to listen and say like,

12:01.440 --> 12:03.360
yeah, man, I know.

12:03.360 --> 12:05.840
Rather than try to be like, grass is always greener.

12:05.840 --> 12:07.040
Sun shines tomorrow.

12:07.680 --> 12:08.960
There's always another day.

12:08.960 --> 12:09.840
Silver lining.

12:09.840 --> 12:15.600
Because that shit can get annoying unless you get the feeling that that's what they're looking for.

12:15.600 --> 12:16.960
But don't just assume that.

12:16.960 --> 12:17.760
Does that make sense?

12:17.760 --> 12:19.520
If that's your natural inclination, though.

12:19.520 --> 12:21.040
Oh, if you're like, Mr. Sunshine?

12:21.040 --> 12:21.920
No, that's my question.

12:21.920 --> 12:27.520
It's like, it is my natural inclination to try to cheer somebody up if they're upset.

12:27.520 --> 12:29.680
I mean, it is just my natural impulse.

12:30.240 --> 12:36.480
Is it right that I should subvert that because it's what the other person wants?

12:36.480 --> 12:38.240
It's case by case, isn't it?

12:38.240 --> 12:39.280
It's case by case.

12:39.280 --> 12:42.720
I don't think you can say it's standard or uniform.

12:44.080 --> 12:44.720
Let's role play.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.400
Let's role play and you guys can come in a different way.

12:46.400 --> 12:47.920
So I'll be somebody who's depressing.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.800
You guys come at me and see just how you handle the situation.

12:50.800 --> 12:51.600
All right, Travis.

12:51.600 --> 12:56.320
You'll be the comforting empathizer.

12:56.320 --> 12:56.800
Okay.

12:56.800 --> 12:59.520
And I'll be like, chuckles.

12:59.520 --> 13:00.020
Okay.

13:01.040 --> 13:01.540
Man.

13:03.280 --> 13:03.840
My man.

13:04.560 --> 13:08.320
It's, you know, they just, Burn Notice got picked up by Esquire.

13:08.320 --> 13:13.040
I'm worried that they're going to change the plot and just like, everything fucking sucks today.

13:13.600 --> 13:14.080
Yeah, man.

13:14.080 --> 13:19.920
I hear you who like that's it.

13:19.920 --> 13:20.480
That's all you got.

13:20.480 --> 13:22.960
That's the fucking way you want to be like.

13:22.960 --> 13:23.520
Yeah, I know.

13:23.520 --> 13:24.960
I hear they also picked up psych.

13:24.960 --> 13:25.680
Am I right?

13:25.680 --> 13:26.560
They're going to ruin it.

13:26.560 --> 13:27.840
I hear they're getting rid of delay.

13:27.840 --> 13:28.960
They wouldn't dare.

13:28.960 --> 13:30.640
That would be the biggest mistake.

13:30.640 --> 13:31.120
I know.

13:31.120 --> 13:31.360
Right.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.120
And now it's cheered up because we're talking about delay.

13:33.120 --> 13:34.000
Everybody's happy.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.960
God, you know the ways to happiness.

13:36.960 --> 13:37.600
Cortex.

13:39.120 --> 13:39.600
All right.

13:39.600 --> 13:40.720
Now it's my turn.

13:40.720 --> 13:41.220
Okay.

13:41.840 --> 13:42.080
All right.

13:42.080 --> 13:42.800
Go ahead, Griffin.

13:42.800 --> 13:44.160
You want the setup again?

13:44.880 --> 13:45.440
Please.

13:45.440 --> 13:48.960
Do you want the same one or do you want me to talk about another problem in my life?

13:48.960 --> 13:51.840
Because right now that's really the most pressing thing I have.

13:51.840 --> 13:52.320
Same one.

13:52.320 --> 13:52.640
Same one.

13:52.640 --> 13:52.880
Okay.

13:52.880 --> 13:53.120
Okay.

13:53.760 --> 13:54.400
Yeah, I don't know.

13:54.400 --> 13:58.000
I was just, you know, I used to just, I knew which channel Burn Notice was on.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.280
It was on USA?

14:00.320 --> 14:00.560
Yeah.

14:00.560 --> 14:01.360
TNT?

14:01.360 --> 14:03.680
I used to just turn it on channel 32, USA.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.440
That's where USA lives on my TV.

14:05.440 --> 14:09.120
I would turn it on and just let it fucking cruise because I knew where the plot was going,

14:09.120 --> 14:10.240
knew where the characters were going.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.360
Now who knows?

14:11.360 --> 14:15.840
Boy, Griffin, whenever I feel the way you're feeling, you know who I turn to?

14:16.880 --> 14:18.960
My puppet friend, Walter.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.520
Hey, thanks for getting me out of the box.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.120
Wait, you're just doing Jeff Dunham.

14:23.840 --> 14:25.520
You're doing a Jeff Dunham thing.

14:25.520 --> 14:27.520
You listen to me, whippersnapper?

14:27.520 --> 14:31.600
I think he's actually doing The Beaver, the Mel Gibson movie, The Beaver,

14:31.600 --> 14:33.280
which started a Beaver puppet named Walter.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.440
You're doing Jeff Beaver.

14:35.440 --> 14:37.280
It's me, Jose Jalapeño on a stick.

14:37.280 --> 14:39.280
No, it's definitely Dunham.

14:39.280 --> 14:39.840
Hold on.

14:39.840 --> 14:42.400
Now, let there be no doubt about it.

14:42.400 --> 14:43.520
He has gone full Dunham.

14:44.800 --> 14:45.840
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.

14:45.840 --> 14:47.200
Justin has gone full Dunham.

14:47.200 --> 14:49.120
There is only one punishment for me.

14:49.120 --> 14:49.920
You guys got me.

14:51.840 --> 14:53.680
It's Ahmed the dead terrorist.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.520
Silence, I kill you.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.640
Flip the kill switch.

14:57.520 --> 14:58.320
I kill you.

14:58.320 --> 14:59.360
I kill your switch.

14:59.360 --> 15:01.200
Protocol black.

15:01.760 --> 15:03.440
Sexy Garfield is compromised.

15:03.440 --> 15:05.360
Sexy Garfield is compromised.

15:05.360 --> 15:05.840
Flood it.

15:05.840 --> 15:06.640
Flood the station.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.720
Guys, my office is filling with water.

15:08.720 --> 15:09.200
Blow it.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.240
Blow the diodes.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.520
Release the biotoxin.

15:11.520 --> 15:12.080
We're done.

15:12.080 --> 15:13.760
My diodes just blew in my office.

15:13.760 --> 15:14.560
What are you guys doing?

15:16.880 --> 15:21.040
The only way to kill Justin is to poison him with the biotoxin while he's drowning and

15:21.040 --> 15:22.240
being electrocuted.

15:22.240 --> 15:25.680
Once he gets going on that Dunham terror, he becomes like the fucking juggernaut.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.120
You know who's like the fucking juggernaut?

15:27.120 --> 15:28.320
My friend Bubba J.

15:28.320 --> 15:29.360
Oh, God.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.920
Why do you know so many Jeff Dunham puppets?

15:31.920 --> 15:33.920
Because I'm on Wikipedia, you dumb fuck.

15:33.920 --> 15:35.440
Who's the dumb fuck?

15:35.440 --> 15:37.360
Who's the dumb fuck now?

15:37.360 --> 15:39.600
Google knows what's up with you and your Jeff Dunham lust.

15:40.160 --> 15:41.360
Have I talked about the...

15:42.560 --> 15:46.080
As soon as I moved to Austin and I was like meeting people and I was meeting people who

15:46.080 --> 15:50.400
knew like my friends and it's that weird time and you don't know like whether this person

15:50.400 --> 15:52.720
is going to become a close friend of yours or just an acquaintance that you're going

15:52.720 --> 15:58.800
to meet exactly once, how I was meeting those people and for some reason I started using

15:58.800 --> 16:03.840
whether or not they like Jeff Dunham as a metric and there is a horrifying, horrifying

16:03.840 --> 16:08.560
amount of people who fucking swear by that dude's brand of comedy and it's the people

16:08.560 --> 16:11.280
you least expect because I'd be like hanging out with somebody like, you're really cool.

16:11.280 --> 16:14.880
I think you're going to be one of my new friends in this hometown and then I would make a Jeff

16:14.880 --> 16:17.760
Dunham joke and they'd be like, I don't understand why you're...

16:18.400 --> 16:21.920
I don't understand why you're making fun of Jeff Dunham because like his shit's so on

16:21.920 --> 16:22.480
point.

16:22.480 --> 16:23.600
Travis, I'm sorry.

16:23.600 --> 16:27.840
Are you a bigger Jeff Dunham fan than I knew or are you like completely ignorant about

16:27.840 --> 16:28.960
the work of Jeff Dunham?

16:29.680 --> 16:29.920
Huh?

16:31.360 --> 16:32.080
Okay.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.360
You know he was on Ellen.

16:33.360 --> 16:38.240
He was also on 30 Rock, which makes me think that maybe this dude, maybe, maybe, maybe,

16:38.240 --> 16:42.160
maybe he's one of those guys that has like worked up this whole persona, but in real

16:42.160 --> 16:47.040
life is like, God, I know that this is like the stupidest shit, but for some reason they

16:47.040 --> 16:47.600
love it.

16:47.600 --> 16:48.960
Like Larry the Cable Guy, you mean?

16:48.960 --> 16:49.200
Yeah.

16:49.200 --> 16:50.560
Exactly like Larry the Cable Guy.

16:50.560 --> 16:50.800
Yes.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.360
When in behind the scenes, he's like, please call me Lawrence.

16:53.360 --> 16:53.760
Please.

16:53.760 --> 16:56.000
My name is Lawrence, Cable Doctor.

16:56.000 --> 17:01.040
I went to Cable University for seven years to get my doctorate in cabling.

17:01.040 --> 17:03.680
I can't believe I've sunk to such a level.

17:03.680 --> 17:05.680
I got that program finished.

17:07.360 --> 17:08.800
Like got her done is like his thing.

17:10.400 --> 17:10.720
Sure.

17:11.600 --> 17:12.480
I'll allow it.

17:12.480 --> 17:16.640
I recently found out the men I work with make more money than I do.

17:17.440 --> 17:20.480
I'm a lady working as a carpenter.

17:20.480 --> 17:21.920
Cabinet maker, really?

17:21.920 --> 17:26.080
In a small old fashioned town with a chance getting hired anywhere else is not likely.

17:26.080 --> 17:28.720
I'm really mad, but I'm not sure what to do about it.

17:28.720 --> 17:29.840
Can you help?

17:29.840 --> 17:32.880
That's from Equality Challenge on the East Coast.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.560
Well, you've come to the right place.

17:34.560 --> 17:36.800
You've come to just the right place.

17:36.800 --> 17:37.920
As white men, we...

17:39.200 --> 17:40.080
God damn it.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.640
Can you carve secret messages in the cabinets?

17:44.160 --> 17:44.880
Like what?

17:44.880 --> 17:50.720
Like when people buy the cabinet inside, it says like, made by an underpaid woman.

17:50.720 --> 17:51.520
Yeah.

17:51.520 --> 17:53.600
Oh, that's way better than what I thought you were going with it.

17:53.600 --> 17:56.480
I thought you meant like magic spells to make it like Indiana in the cupboard.

17:57.920 --> 17:58.720
Oh my god.

17:58.720 --> 18:00.160
Wait, holy shit.

18:00.160 --> 18:00.960
Wait a minute.

18:01.680 --> 18:06.560
Travis, are you saying that you think she should carve incantations into the cabinets?

18:06.560 --> 18:08.640
Listen, all I'm saying is that the Indian in the cupboard,

18:08.640 --> 18:10.320
cupboard had to come from somewhere, right?

18:10.320 --> 18:13.280
Okay, so it's like appear magically in the little boy's bedroom.

18:13.280 --> 18:13.760
This is great.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.880
You put Monopoly money in there, close it, and then all of a sudden you've...

18:16.880 --> 18:23.280
That's like you create a toy version of the Lilly Ledbetter Act and you put it in there

18:23.280 --> 18:25.760
and then it's been ratified into law.

18:25.760 --> 18:29.040
Have you thought about asking for more money?

18:29.040 --> 18:29.840
But that's horseshit.

18:29.840 --> 18:31.040
She shouldn't have to.

18:31.040 --> 18:33.600
Why don't you put your fucking boss in the cupboard, turn him into a toy?

18:34.160 --> 18:35.120
It's probably a small cupboard, though.

18:35.120 --> 18:36.880
You probably have to fucking kill him.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.400
You know, I'm so embarrassed now, you guys,

18:38.400 --> 18:41.360
because I just remembered that in India in the cupboard, it's not the cupboard at all.

18:41.360 --> 18:44.320
It's the key, because at one point he uses it on a chest

18:44.320 --> 18:46.960
and that's how he goes to visit a little bear.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.240
I'm so embarrassed, you guys.

18:48.240 --> 18:49.200
Yeah, this is humiliating.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.200
We'll probably have to delete this question from the show

18:51.200 --> 18:53.920
because people are listening like, it's the key, you dumb fucks.

18:53.920 --> 18:57.600
All the people on my Indian in the Cupboard forums are just like,

18:57.600 --> 19:00.320
oh my God, I can't believe Keymaster73 just said that.

19:02.320 --> 19:03.200
I can't believe it.

19:03.200 --> 19:04.480
He's got key in his username.

19:06.480 --> 19:07.600
His avatar is a key.

19:08.160 --> 19:11.840
I think talking to your boss is probably a good first option,

19:13.200 --> 19:15.920
at least opening that discussion thread.

19:15.920 --> 19:19.280
So may I suggest something much more passive aggressive?

19:19.280 --> 19:20.400
Of course.

19:20.400 --> 19:21.040
Thank you.

19:21.040 --> 19:24.160
So say you're getting paid 77 cents on the dollar, right?

19:24.160 --> 19:28.160
You should start doing 77% of the normal work of everyone else.

19:28.160 --> 19:33.520
Or make all your cabinet parts 77% smaller than spec,

19:33.520 --> 19:36.560
than spec requires, than the blueprint has demanded.

19:37.200 --> 19:38.960
And then the boss comes to you and he's like,

19:38.960 --> 19:39.680
hey, what the hell?

19:39.680 --> 19:41.920
You're like, oh, this is all I'm getting paid for.

19:41.920 --> 19:45.440
Oh, sorry, you only paid me to put saloon doors on this cabinet.

19:45.440 --> 19:45.940
Sorry.

19:46.800 --> 19:49.360
Yeah, I know it's supposed to be for private unmentionables,

19:49.360 --> 19:50.960
but now people are going to be able to see the tops and the bottoms.

19:50.960 --> 19:52.960
I know that this was your unmentionables cabinet.

19:54.240 --> 19:59.040
I'm a carpenter who works at an independent unmentionables cabinet agency.

19:59.680 --> 20:01.680
We build cabinets to spec.

20:01.680 --> 20:05.200
It's a small town with small unmentionables ideals.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.080
And now my doors are going to be even smaller.

20:08.080 --> 20:09.440
Because fuck these pigs.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.920
Why don't you carve that in your fucking cap?

20:11.920 --> 20:13.120
Fuck these pigs.

20:13.120 --> 20:14.240
I hope you enjoy your cabinet.

20:14.240 --> 20:16.400
It was made by hate pigs.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.800
Are you all, are you maybe the youngest?

20:18.800 --> 20:21.680
Are you the most, not even like physically the youngest,

20:21.680 --> 20:24.080
but the most junior member of the staff?

20:24.080 --> 20:25.120
Is that possible?

20:25.840 --> 20:28.800
Or is that just me like wishing the glass ceiling wasn't there?

20:28.800 --> 20:33.040
I actually know from other details from a longer email that she sent that she is not.

20:33.040 --> 20:35.280
That there have been men that have been hired since her.

20:35.280 --> 20:36.640
Well, that's dog shit.

20:36.640 --> 20:37.840
Well, that's dog shit.

20:37.840 --> 20:43.440
Tell us who they are and we'll tell everybody not to buy their fucking misogynist cabinets.

20:43.440 --> 20:49.440
Or start carving like a, you need to come up with some branding and carve that into the cabinet.

20:49.440 --> 20:51.440
And then we say only buy cabinets that have,

20:52.480 --> 20:55.920
that have equality challenge on the East Coast brand on it.

20:55.920 --> 20:58.720
Or start your own cabinet company with us.

21:00.480 --> 21:01.200
Fabbinets.

21:01.760 --> 21:02.560
Fabbinets?

21:02.560 --> 21:02.960
Yes.

21:04.160 --> 21:08.000
Equal, equalblinets.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.920
Equalblinets.

21:09.920 --> 21:10.960
Equalblinets.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.560
Equalblinets.

21:12.560 --> 21:13.440
Equalblinets.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.160
Hurniture.

21:16.320 --> 21:17.200
Oh my God.

21:17.200 --> 21:18.240
That's pretty good, right?

21:18.800 --> 21:19.040
Yeah.

21:19.600 --> 21:20.000
Yeah.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.800
So we'll start that company and fuck those guys.

21:22.800 --> 21:23.840
Hurniture Fabbinets.

21:23.840 --> 21:26.960
If you don't buy a Hurniture Fabbinet, you're putting your clothes in the garbage.

21:26.960 --> 21:28.720
The good news is I watched Shark Tank.

21:28.720 --> 21:31.680
Like one person can start a revolution.

21:32.960 --> 21:37.520
You've got to go and tell this story to all the sharks and they'll be like,

21:37.520 --> 21:38.560
I'm going to gobble this up.

21:38.560 --> 21:39.840
You hooked me.

21:39.840 --> 21:43.600
Can I say something though?

21:43.600 --> 21:44.560
Please.

21:44.560 --> 21:45.760
I do not think they'd bite.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.480
I do not think they'd bite for Hurniture Fabbinets.

21:49.120 --> 21:49.440
Why?

21:50.240 --> 21:53.360
It just doesn't seem particularly lucrative.

21:53.360 --> 21:57.440
You're charging a premium for an ideal.

21:57.440 --> 22:02.160
And I'm just saying Mark Cuban is not going to fucking, not going to bite that bait.

22:03.440 --> 22:05.200
Well, if you get his kids involved.

22:05.200 --> 22:10.400
Mark Cuban will always invest if you, if the product involves his kids.

22:10.400 --> 22:15.200
I saw him give a woman, an 18 year old girl, an 18 year old girl, five,

22:15.200 --> 22:17.920
well I guess 18 year old woman, technically adult woman,

22:18.720 --> 22:24.560
$500,000 for her eczema skin product line because his kids have eczema.

22:24.560 --> 22:25.360
That's it.

22:25.360 --> 22:25.760
That's it.

22:25.760 --> 22:27.600
You make Hurniture Toy Fabbinets.

22:28.560 --> 22:29.840
What do you, what do your kids got?

22:29.840 --> 22:32.800
They, where are your kids going to put their fucking eczema medicine, Mark?

22:32.800 --> 22:35.120
They're going to put them in a Hurniture Fabbinet.

22:36.400 --> 22:38.480
It's got a little picture of eczema on it.

22:38.480 --> 22:41.600
So the kids know what is stored in this particular unit.

22:41.600 --> 22:44.160
And they got fun characters like Lawrence the Cable Gentleman.

22:45.920 --> 22:47.600
Lawrence the Scaly Cable Gentleman.

22:48.240 --> 22:51.520
He applies, he's in this caricature, he's applying a salve.

22:51.520 --> 22:54.640
He's applying a salve to his rotten, rotten flesh.

22:55.280 --> 23:00.960
Speaking of balms and salves necessary to keep your, keep your ship right.

23:00.960 --> 23:02.560
It's Max Fun Drive time.

23:03.120 --> 23:10.400
And we couldn't be more excited to, to present, I guess, this, this, this,

23:10.400 --> 23:15.520
the donation rewards this year because they are fantastic.

23:15.520 --> 23:19.360
Well, let's talk though first about where your money is actually going, Nitto.

23:20.160 --> 23:26.320
It's going to, it's going to the Max Fun Fun Network to expand the network and bring on new

23:26.320 --> 23:28.880
shows, which I don't know if you've been paying attention.

23:28.880 --> 23:31.360
You really didn't have to be this year

23:32.000 --> 23:35.040
to notice all the fucking shows that have been added to the Max Fun Network.

23:35.040 --> 23:38.080
It's been like out of control rapid expansion.

23:38.080 --> 23:39.680
We got One Bad Mother.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.520
We got Risk was this year, I think.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.680
Yeah, Memory Palace was this year.

23:43.680 --> 23:44.800
Memory Palace was this year.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.280
Throwing Shade wasn't this year, was it?

23:47.280 --> 23:48.080
I don't think so.

23:48.080 --> 23:49.600
I feel like it's been more than a year.

23:50.400 --> 23:51.120
With Dave Hill.

23:51.760 --> 23:54.480
Dave Hill's podcasting incident is this year.

23:54.480 --> 23:58.480
Wham Bam Pow, our new podcast that I don't even think we've talked about with our good

23:58.480 --> 24:03.200
friends Cameron Esposito and Rhea Butcher and Ricky Carmona.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.920
I don't know if you guys listen to other shows other than ours.

24:05.920 --> 24:10.640
It may be presumptive to even suggest that you don't, but like, seriously, it's an amazing

24:10.640 --> 24:16.160
network of comedy that really is not reproduced anywhere else.

24:16.160 --> 24:19.360
And it's not just us, it's you guys too, like the Max Fun Fun community.

24:19.360 --> 24:23.600
I feel like I've been stressing this a lot lately, but it's, it's this unique, perfect

24:23.600 --> 24:27.120
community of like no dicks.

24:28.560 --> 24:31.120
So like that, I think is special and that is worth supporting.

24:31.120 --> 24:37.840
So whenever you donate, it helps us make more money from doing the show and spend more time

24:37.840 --> 24:40.400
on the podcast and do more stuff.

24:40.400 --> 24:41.600
We bought new mics.

24:42.320 --> 24:46.800
I think you'll notice after we joined, the quality of our podcast got much, much better.

24:46.800 --> 24:50.720
And not only that, like if you're looking to donate, there are so many different levels

24:50.720 --> 24:55.840
and you'll find one that fits your budget, something you can handle for the year.

24:55.840 --> 24:58.240
It's, you know, it's separated donation by month.

24:58.240 --> 25:01.520
It starts from five dollars a month all the way up to two hundred dollars a month.

25:01.520 --> 25:03.040
There's going to be a level that works for you.

25:03.040 --> 25:05.600
And all of those levels contain gifts.

25:06.560 --> 25:08.880
Thank you for for helping out with the network.

25:08.880 --> 25:10.720
You want to give ten dollars?

25:10.720 --> 25:12.880
You're going to be a friend of the family.

25:12.880 --> 25:19.760
That means you're going to get some awesome Max Fun earbuds or earbuds with the distinctive

25:19.760 --> 25:24.480
Max Fun logo on the the ear part that goes into your ear.

25:24.480 --> 25:28.640
And you're also now which part is because sometimes I plug like the audio jack in there.

25:28.640 --> 25:33.280
That's where the sound hole goes, like the holes in your face where sound goes into.

25:33.840 --> 25:35.120
Oh, yeah.

25:36.240 --> 25:39.040
So that's that's the ten dollar a month level.

25:39.920 --> 25:43.760
And you're also going to get at any donation level, you're going to get some really cool

25:44.800 --> 25:47.680
exclusive bonus material.

25:47.680 --> 25:54.960
We record a special episode of of of our program and there's a whole wealth of

25:55.680 --> 26:00.480
prior year bonus material in there that you can get in and and including an episode we

26:00.480 --> 26:04.960
recorded with our daddy and including some video of one of our live shows.

26:04.960 --> 26:06.240
So that's right.

26:06.240 --> 26:10.720
Yeah, there's a lot of a lot of digi content, not just for us, but for all of the all the

26:10.720 --> 26:11.840
Max Fun shows.

26:13.040 --> 26:15.920

26:15.920 --> 26:21.280
more supportive and Randy and Randy, there's a twenty dollar month

26:35.600 --> 26:42.160
survival kit, fucking survival kit from Extreme from Extreme Restraints, which includes a

26:42.160 --> 26:44.320
pocket sized velvafield turbo massager.

26:44.320 --> 26:47.440
It massages it, whatever you want it to massage.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.800
Maybe you've got a sore back.

26:48.800 --> 26:51.200
Maybe you've got a hard balls.

26:52.640 --> 26:54.000
You got the hardest balls.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.040
It's got attachments.

26:55.040 --> 26:59.920
So like I don't even know what the attachments are, but I'm sure there's one for your back

26:59.920 --> 27:00.800
and one for your balls.

27:01.600 --> 27:06.560
There is also and this is the best rocket lube, which is a high quality water based

27:06.560 --> 27:13.120
maximum fun branded lubricant for your parts for your down there.

27:13.120 --> 27:17.600
Down there for your parts or for other parts for other people's parts.

27:17.600 --> 27:21.600
Have you ever shoved it in and you used a lube that was average fun?

27:22.720 --> 27:23.680
That's it's not.

27:23.680 --> 27:25.040
It's just not cutting it.

27:25.040 --> 27:26.160
Doesn't cut the mustard.

27:26.160 --> 27:27.280
Have you ever used mustard?

27:28.320 --> 27:30.800
That's that's absolutely ineffective.

27:30.800 --> 27:31.920
That is not even an option.

27:31.920 --> 27:33.760
That is negative fun lube.

27:33.760 --> 27:35.440
We're talking about maximum fun lube.

27:35.440 --> 27:39.440
There's also a black satin mask in case you don't want to see somebody putting mustard

27:39.440 --> 27:41.520
on your on your balls and hitting you with a massager.

27:41.520 --> 27:46.240
Thank you to our friends at extremetrains.com for that.

27:46.240 --> 27:49.520
You also get a max fun rocket tee if you want to let people know what kind of lube you use.

27:50.240 --> 27:51.360
Sure, absolutely.

27:51.360 --> 27:58.400
And and for 35 bucks, you're going to be in Judge John Hodgman's Justice Squad, which

27:58.400 --> 28:05.040
is going to net you two really sharp looking maximum fun shot glasses.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.440
They're actually they're rocks glasses.

28:07.440 --> 28:08.720
They're like the rocks glasses.

28:08.720 --> 28:09.120
I'm sorry.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.440
I didn't tell them from the from the scale.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.600
What's their engraved with the max fun rocket?

28:14.480 --> 28:15.360
They're beautiful.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.240
They're fucking classy.

28:16.240 --> 28:18.880
I'm trying to think of what the it's not a highball glass.

28:18.880 --> 28:19.280
What is it?

28:19.280 --> 28:20.640
Tumbler glass, isn't it?

28:20.640 --> 28:21.760
Yeah, it's thick.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.200
It's got a thick bottom on it.

28:23.200 --> 28:27.520
This is a this is a glass that you put ice in and you put a brown liquor on top of that ice.

28:28.720 --> 28:30.000
Now, here's the thing.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.680
Maybe you're like me and you're sitting there going, yeah, but I I joined last year.

28:33.680 --> 28:35.280
I became a donor last year.

28:35.840 --> 28:39.040
Well, thank you so much for all your support for continuing to support us throughout

28:39.040 --> 28:41.360
the past year and the coming year.

28:41.360 --> 28:44.160
And you think, but all these gifts, they sound great.

28:44.160 --> 28:45.920
How do I get on board with this?

28:45.920 --> 28:46.720
And it's easy.

28:46.720 --> 28:49.680
All you have to do is upgrade to a higher level.

28:49.680 --> 28:54.480
So I went and I decided to become a Justice Squad member this year so that I could cash

28:54.480 --> 28:56.160
in on all of these sweet presents.

28:56.160 --> 28:58.800
Yeah, we're not just we're not just podcasters.

28:58.800 --> 29:00.720
We're we're donors, too.

29:00.720 --> 29:01.600
That's donors.

29:01.600 --> 29:03.760
That's how we that's how, you know, it's legit.

29:03.760 --> 29:08.560
We would never I would never want to belong to a club that I'm not a member of as Woody

29:08.560 --> 29:11.440
Allen once said in his hit film Members Only.

29:12.640 --> 29:17.360
You will, however, even if you don't upgrade, you still have access to all that exclusive

29:18.400 --> 29:19.440
donor content.

29:19.440 --> 29:22.560
But you can't shove that donor content in your pussy and butt.

29:23.520 --> 29:23.760
Yeah.

29:24.320 --> 29:24.880
You know what I mean?

29:24.880 --> 29:28.480
And if you try, it's going to be super dry because you're using a dry jump drive.

29:28.480 --> 29:30.000
You need Max Fun Lube.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.280
Maximumfun.org forward slash donate.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.880
Make sure to tell them NBNBAM sent you.

29:36.880 --> 29:38.480
They are your favorites.

29:38.480 --> 29:41.440
Griffin, how about you get a Yahoo for us?

29:41.440 --> 29:42.320
I have a treasure.

29:42.320 --> 29:45.280
I have a treasure trove of Yahoo answers.

29:45.280 --> 29:49.040
These are some particularly heady nugs, as it were.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.480
Heady choice nugs.

29:50.480 --> 29:52.560
I've stumbled onto the forbidden Yahoo's.

29:53.360 --> 29:53.840
What do you got?

29:54.400 --> 30:02.800
I'm afraid that these Yahoo's may be above our adversarial advice ability pay grade.

30:02.800 --> 30:10.480
Uh-oh, that sounds like, we've never had, well, okay, more accurately, we've had many

30:10.480 --> 30:14.880
questions that we don't know how to answer, but that's never stopped us before.

30:14.880 --> 30:17.120
Right, but it's a new year in April.

30:17.120 --> 30:17.600
Twenty dirt.

30:18.160 --> 30:18.960
It's a new us.

30:19.920 --> 30:26.320
I think we need to realize our deficiencies, and I think we need to reach upwards for a

30:26.320 --> 30:28.480
hand that we can grab that can pull us up.

30:28.480 --> 30:30.640
Do you know what I mean?

30:30.640 --> 30:35.840
I have someone on my speed dial that I turn to, and maybe I can get him on the phone.

30:35.840 --> 30:36.960
Hold on one second.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.920
Let me try to call him on the phone.

30:39.920 --> 30:40.480
This is fun.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.360
That's not the standard Skype noise.

30:45.360 --> 30:47.760
And you only dialed six numbers.

30:49.440 --> 30:50.720
That's seven, okay.

30:50.720 --> 30:51.760
So is he local?

30:51.760 --> 30:59.200
Shut up, shut up, bring, bring, bring, bring, bring, bring.

30:59.200 --> 31:00.000
Shit, he didn't answer.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.400
Hello, hello, excuse me, hello.

31:02.400 --> 31:05.600
Hello, hi, who's this?

31:05.600 --> 31:06.560
This is Dan Savage.

31:07.280 --> 31:09.200
Oh my God, Dan Savage.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.720
How did you have Dan Savage's number?

31:11.840 --> 31:15.520
I've got a question, why didn't you know it would be Dan Savage when you called him?

31:15.520 --> 31:16.800
Why are you surprised by it?

31:18.720 --> 31:20.240
Did you mean to call Fred Savage?

31:20.240 --> 31:24.320
He's right next, I have all the savages in my book together.

31:24.320 --> 31:27.040
Fred Savage is who I call when I need sex advice.

31:29.280 --> 31:32.560
That was my big question, is who watches the Watchmen,

31:32.560 --> 31:35.200
who gives the sex advice to the sex advisor?

31:35.200 --> 31:36.000
Fred Savage.

31:37.920 --> 31:38.560
Question answered.

31:39.440 --> 31:43.440
And when Fred and I are stumped, we go to Chris Savage of Mythbusters for an answer.

31:44.640 --> 31:46.320
That man has never had a sex.

31:46.320 --> 31:51.040
Griffin, what's the, thank you, first off, so much for joining us, Dan.

31:51.040 --> 31:54.960
Griffin has some, as he says, choice, choice, sorry, Griffin, choice nugs.

31:55.680 --> 32:00.400
Choice, Hetty, the dankest herb that Yahoo has to offer.

32:00.400 --> 32:04.560
Do we need, do we need to introduce Dan, or is he a man that requires no introduction?

32:04.560 --> 32:07.840
Hopefully, if you're listening to our dumb show, you know that Dan Savage

32:08.880 --> 32:11.360
began the Inconspirator project with his husband, Terry.

32:11.360 --> 32:14.480
He has the sex advice column, Savage Love,

32:14.480 --> 32:19.200
also the Sex Advice Podcast, and Rival Sex Advice Podcast.

32:19.200 --> 32:20.720
Rival Sex Advice Podcast.

32:22.240 --> 32:25.360
Not rivals, we share the podcast network together.

32:25.360 --> 32:28.240
There's room enough in this world for all four of us,

32:28.240 --> 32:30.480
so long as you three stay in one podcast.

32:31.040 --> 32:34.640
If you branch out into three podcasts, there's no room anymore for us, and we will go to war.

32:34.640 --> 32:37.280
Oh, those would be some lonely, lonely podcasts.

32:37.280 --> 32:40.880
You're gonna stay in your straight podcast ghetto, all three of you together.

32:40.880 --> 32:44.480
We, and only one of us knows, actually knows what we're talking about, so that's.

32:44.480 --> 32:49.520
Yeah, that's one more than knows what they're talking about on my podcast,

32:49.520 --> 32:51.440
so you've got that on me.

32:51.440 --> 32:53.920
Griffin, I'm ready. Hit me with this first question.

32:55.440 --> 32:58.560
Yeah, let's, let's get into it. How about this one?

32:58.560 --> 33:01.360
It was sent in by Catherine Hoffman. Thank you, Catherine.

33:01.360 --> 33:03.440
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Tony, who asks,

33:04.400 --> 33:06.640
how long can you wear edible underwear?

33:06.640 --> 33:11.200
Plan to surprise the lady for Valentine's Day. Problem is, I need to work that day,

33:11.200 --> 33:14.640
and I will not have time to change before I see her.

33:14.640 --> 33:17.680
Is it okay to wear it for long periods of time? I work in construction.

33:18.240 --> 33:22.320
Oh, no. That's the worst thing you could have said at the end.

33:22.320 --> 33:25.040
That is not a real question. That's not a real question, you guys.

33:25.040 --> 33:28.400
You're getting faked out. No one has ever, in the whole history of edible underwear,

33:28.400 --> 33:32.560
ever worn edible underwear, which are fruit roll-ups in the shape of pantyhose.

33:32.560 --> 33:36.640
Sure. Next, pass, pass. No, it didn't happen.

33:36.640 --> 33:39.360
No. What happens to all the edible underwear, then?

33:39.360 --> 33:43.440
Do you just get desperate, realize you have no fruit roll-ups in the house, and just go for it?

33:43.440 --> 33:47.280
Yeah, and you pack them into your kid's lunch. Send them off to school.

33:47.280 --> 33:49.680
You can impress his friends.

33:49.680 --> 33:53.280
Do you at least cut them into fun shapes, or do you just, like...

33:53.280 --> 33:56.960
Yeah, only if you're a helicopter parent, would you bother with that.

33:56.960 --> 34:02.960
If your kid can't tear it apart with his teeth, like everybody else with fruit roll-up under panties.

34:02.960 --> 34:04.480
These are some tough panties.

34:04.480 --> 34:07.360
You're tearing all the kid's creativity away, too.

34:07.360 --> 34:09.920
Let the kid tear the panties into whatever shapes he wants to.

34:09.920 --> 34:10.720
Exactly.

34:10.720 --> 34:15.680
Also, as somebody who has dived so deep into Yahoo Answers, who is...

34:15.680 --> 34:20.720
I'm perpetually stuck in Yahoo Answers limbo. I am not convinced that there isn't somebody out there

34:20.720 --> 34:26.640
who wears edible underwear for their comfort, for their... just for relaxation.

34:26.640 --> 34:29.520
The thing is, the missing part there, though, the leap you haven't made is,

34:29.520 --> 34:31.920
there might be somebody out there wearing edible underwear,

34:31.920 --> 34:35.520
but no one in the whole history of edible underwear has ever slept with that person,

34:35.520 --> 34:37.360
or any other person who wears edible underwear.

34:37.360 --> 34:38.400
Oh, I see what you're saying.

34:38.400 --> 34:44.400
That person wears edible underwear in theory that they might one day in practice have sex with somebody,

34:44.400 --> 34:45.920
but it's never actually happened.

34:45.920 --> 34:53.120
Sure. But if there were such a fucking psychopath on there, they would be an active user in the Yahoo Answers service.

34:53.120 --> 34:54.720
That is 100% true.

34:54.720 --> 34:59.520
Griffin, how about another question? I want to help someone today. This is our chance.

35:01.520 --> 35:05.040
How about this? It was sent in by Emily Wall. Thank you, Emily.

35:05.040 --> 35:07.920
It's by Yahoo Answers user dropdeadgorgeous, who asks,

35:07.920 --> 35:16.240
Well, IDK how, I would ask this, but, um, how do you touch a girl's boobs?

35:16.240 --> 35:18.720
You see, I've touched her boobs before, but IDK if I did it right, and I got real nervous.

35:18.720 --> 35:21.200
Also, how do you do it while her shirt is still on?

35:21.200 --> 35:27.920
Dan, I should have warned you before we started. Sometimes our show can get a little blue.

35:27.920 --> 35:32.320
So, I don't want to make you uncomfortable. Thank you, Dan.

35:32.320 --> 35:39.920
Our show can get a little blue. So, I don't want to make you uncomfortable. Things do get a tad racy.

35:39.920 --> 35:44.880
We talk about things that could be observed as being sin in the eyes of the Lord.

35:44.880 --> 35:46.720
Yeah. So, just a heads up.

35:46.720 --> 35:47.360
Just a heads up.

35:48.400 --> 35:54.080
How do you touch? If you know about this, I would love to hear it. How do you touch a girl's boobs?

35:54.720 --> 35:55.440
With permission.

35:57.120 --> 36:00.800
That's obviously number one key thing.

36:00.800 --> 36:02.240
I would start with consent.

36:05.040 --> 36:05.760
Absolutely.

36:05.760 --> 36:10.400
Have you tried being super attractive and charming and, like, saying dope shit to women?

36:10.400 --> 36:16.720
That does seem like people who are on all sides of the court, people who are very attractive

36:16.720 --> 36:21.360
and say the right things all the time, they seem to touch the most privates.

36:21.360 --> 36:25.440
I've also found that women really like it when you pretend to be a DJ on their boobs.

36:26.080 --> 36:28.480
No, I don't think that's actually attractive.

36:28.480 --> 36:30.960
100% of the time. Every time.

36:30.960 --> 36:33.840
I'm going to have to defer to you guys on this. You're three straight guys, right?

36:33.840 --> 36:38.080
I've only ever touched a girl's boobs under duress in my teen years when I was trying to

36:38.080 --> 36:40.640
prove I was straight, and I'm sure I was bad at it.

36:41.760 --> 36:43.600
A crowded subway car, perhaps?

36:45.200 --> 36:49.680
No, a girlfriend. I had girlfriends. I said dope shit, and I got a girlfriend.

36:49.680 --> 36:53.440
Then I had to do dick shit that I didn't want to do with her, and it was a disaster.

36:53.440 --> 36:58.320
Apparently, pretending your girlfriend is Andy Gibbs is not a form of birth control.

37:03.600 --> 37:04.880
I mean, there's a lot of methods you can...

37:06.080 --> 37:08.880
I'll tell you this. Don't go to Yahoo Answers to ask this,

37:09.680 --> 37:13.280
because one of the top answers is, who cares? Just grab it. That's not it.

37:14.080 --> 37:15.440
That's 100% the wrong one.

37:15.440 --> 37:17.280
Oh, no. That's not right.

37:17.280 --> 37:20.960
Even with consent, just, like, blindly just, like...

37:20.960 --> 37:23.440
Just latching on like an alien baby to...

37:23.440 --> 37:26.720
Going with the double crab claw is a fucking...

37:26.720 --> 37:28.640
Like a drunk guy looking for the light switch.

37:29.840 --> 37:32.640
Have you guys all had sex with more than one woman each?

37:34.080 --> 37:35.120
At the same time?

37:35.120 --> 37:35.680
Simultaneously or...

37:35.680 --> 37:41.040
No, not simultaneously, like, in sequence. I would assume that women, different women,

37:41.040 --> 37:45.360
enjoy having their boobs touched differently. You know, some guys like to have their balls slapped,

37:45.360 --> 37:48.640
and some guys just like to have them cupped. Is it not the same?

37:48.640 --> 37:52.000
Ah. I like having one ball slapped and the other one cupped at the same time.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.240
That's a big trick. That's a good trick that you can do.

37:54.240 --> 37:57.360
I like it to be like that desktop thing where you swing one,

37:57.360 --> 37:59.680
and then they kind of clack against each other and swing back and forth.

37:59.680 --> 38:01.440
Yeah, sure. Oh, I forgot to mention, this is...

38:01.440 --> 38:03.680
I mean, obviously Justin and Travis know this because they're my brothers,

38:03.680 --> 38:05.040
but Dan, I have super loose balls.

38:05.840 --> 38:09.040
They are crazy, crazy, crazy loose. It's...

38:09.040 --> 38:11.360
Well, you should do your kegels. And you can actually get...

38:11.360 --> 38:13.360
There's a surgery where they take in your scrotum.

38:13.360 --> 38:17.200
They've done a lot of nerve endings in the scrotum, so you can safely have that adjusted.

38:17.200 --> 38:21.200
Just tuck it. Yeah. Well, I'll see about that.

38:21.200 --> 38:23.360
See, you are... God damn, you're good at this.

38:23.360 --> 38:25.520
Yeah, you know things. We should learn some things.

38:25.520 --> 38:27.120
Yeah, I know things inside and out.

38:27.120 --> 38:30.560
We should learn at least a few things before we start doing this again, guys,

38:30.560 --> 38:33.920
because we really don't know any... know anything.

38:34.720 --> 38:39.280
I think you got to start Tinder, and then you can ramp up from there if need be.

38:39.280 --> 38:42.880
If the feedback... It's all about active feedback, isn't it?

38:42.880 --> 38:46.560
It's all about doing some shit. Start with the most harmless shit you can,

38:46.560 --> 38:47.920
and then just ramp it up.

38:47.920 --> 38:50.000
Hey, can I tell you a funny story about my uncle,

38:50.000 --> 38:52.080
another one of those straight guys in the world like you three?

38:52.640 --> 38:53.440
Sure.

38:53.440 --> 38:55.280
It's about balls, so it's kind of relevant.

38:55.280 --> 38:58.640
He was a rock star in California in the 70s of this big regional band,

38:58.640 --> 39:02.480
and he used to get a lot of blow jobs from... What are those things called? Groupies?

39:02.480 --> 39:06.720
And because it was the 70s, he slept with a lot of virgin groupies,

39:06.720 --> 39:10.960
and that was fine with him. And he likes a lot of pain during a blow job.

39:10.960 --> 39:13.920
He likes to have his balls punched and slapped and his dick bitten.

39:13.920 --> 39:16.880
Hey, Uncle Jimmy, if you're listening, how you doing?

39:16.880 --> 39:18.400
Welcome to the show, Uncle Jimmy.

39:18.400 --> 39:22.400
And so what he would always say to these girls when he would instruct them

39:22.400 --> 39:26.560
on how exactly he liked his junk just mauled,

39:26.560 --> 39:29.760
is he would pat them on the head and say, this is how all guys like it.

39:29.760 --> 39:32.320
Oh, no! Uncle Jimmy!

39:32.320 --> 39:35.280
So that when they then slept with the next rock star...

39:37.280 --> 39:38.320
That's the...

39:38.320 --> 39:44.480
That poor guy got his junk just fucking beat down.

39:44.480 --> 39:46.960
And that would make Uncle Jimmy, late at night, he'd just think,

39:46.960 --> 39:51.360
oh, that girl I slept with last month is now sucking Mick Jagger off.

39:51.360 --> 39:52.320
Wonder how that's going.

39:52.320 --> 39:54.560
Not good!

39:54.560 --> 39:59.280
You're creating psychological time bombs inside of these women's sex track.

39:59.280 --> 40:01.360
That's actually what Paint It Black was written about.

40:01.360 --> 40:08.800
Man, can you imagine thinking like, oh, you must be one of Jimmy's girls.

40:08.800 --> 40:12.320
I can't believe you've been poisoning the well for everybody.

40:12.320 --> 40:17.040
You carry his brand of ball trauma.

40:18.720 --> 40:20.480
That might have taken care of your loose balls.

40:21.040 --> 40:24.240
She could have taken a chunk out of them and you could have stitched it right up.

40:24.240 --> 40:25.360
Right. Yeah, there you go.

40:25.360 --> 40:25.860
Sure.

40:27.040 --> 40:28.480
Surgeons, you can keep a secret.

40:28.480 --> 40:30.480
Griffin, I needed one more question.

40:30.480 --> 40:31.520
I know you have one more.

40:32.560 --> 40:33.680
I have a few.

40:33.680 --> 40:34.400
Uh-oh.

40:34.400 --> 40:37.040
This one, okay, this one was sent in by Valerie Rogers.

40:37.040 --> 40:37.600
Thanks, Valerie.

40:37.600 --> 40:44.080
It's by Yahoo Answers user D341255, which I imagine it's not their Christian name,

40:44.080 --> 40:47.040
who asks, should mixed gender swim classes be allowed?

40:47.040 --> 40:49.600
At my daughter's schools from sixth to tenth grade in PE,

40:49.600 --> 40:52.320
she attends the swim unit and boys and girls have it together?

40:52.320 --> 40:53.520
Why is this allowed?

40:53.520 --> 40:56.240
Shouldn't this make the girls feel uncomfortable and give boys an opportunity to harass and

40:56.240 --> 40:59.760
humiliate girls and cause distractions and goofing off among everybody?

40:59.760 --> 41:01.680
Not to mention, young boys will be around with no shirt,

41:01.680 --> 41:04.880
which I think is inappropriate for girls to be around of.

41:04.880 --> 41:05.520
Woof.

41:05.520 --> 41:06.160
Wow.

41:06.160 --> 41:07.680
As do I, sort of.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.720
I don't think there should be mixed gender relationships at all,

41:12.720 --> 41:15.440
in pools and swimming suites at all.

41:15.440 --> 41:16.560
In no situation.

41:16.560 --> 41:18.960
Those mixed gender relationships, they never work out.

41:19.840 --> 41:26.000
Right. I mean, I guess in defense of whatever principal or gym teacher has put together this

41:26.000 --> 41:32.880
particular program, sixth to tenth grade is like, there's a bubble there in a young man's life

41:32.880 --> 41:38.720
where he is incredibly sexually mature and he knows how to really handle himself around,

41:38.720 --> 41:41.120
you know, temptation and his female peers.

41:41.120 --> 41:45.600
And that bubble lasts from ages, you know, 10 to 15.

41:45.600 --> 41:48.080
So this, I mean, I don't see any problem with it.

41:48.080 --> 41:55.920
I would also say that the young men do not need any extra help to sexualize women at that point.

41:55.920 --> 42:00.320
So I think whether they're in, you know, bathing suits or like full on parkas.

42:00.320 --> 42:04.000
Or encased in iron maidens, it doesn't matter.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.120
And if the water in the pool is growing increasingly opaque over

42:07.120 --> 42:08.960
the course of the swim class, you have a problem.

42:10.720 --> 42:16.960
If there's a half inch of spume on top of this, of foamy spume, there's an issue.

42:16.960 --> 42:19.600
We brought out a UV light and the place burned down.

42:19.600 --> 42:24.560
So it was a pretty, it was a bad scene.

42:24.560 --> 42:26.480
I am stealing that.

42:27.680 --> 42:31.280
That fucking graduating class is not going to be able to look at each other on the,

42:31.280 --> 42:33.680
on the fucking podium and getting their diplomas.

42:35.520 --> 42:40.080
You know, not that there isn't sexual tension, I must say in a single gender swim class that

42:40.080 --> 42:45.200
I had to do in freshman year at Quigley Preparatory Seminary North, a high school,

42:45.200 --> 42:49.200
Catholic school for boys thinking about becoming priests where I shit you not.

42:49.200 --> 42:50.640
Is that the whole title of the school?

42:50.640 --> 42:56.160
Quigley Preparatory Seminary North, where I shit you not, swim class was in the nude.

42:56.160 --> 42:58.960
We wonder where these problems in the Catholic church came from.

42:58.960 --> 42:59.280
What?

43:00.400 --> 43:05.200
Did this swim class happen next to the vomitorium because it took place in ancient Rome?

43:05.840 --> 43:06.800
Basically.

43:06.800 --> 43:08.640
And there were two priests on staff full time.

43:08.640 --> 43:09.840
They were called disciplinarians.

43:09.840 --> 43:13.120
They sat in an office all day having teenage boys sent to them to get spanked.

43:14.160 --> 43:16.880
I was going to be a priest until they eliminated those positions.

43:16.880 --> 43:21.760
And then I thought, you know what, I can wear dresses and live in a big house and

43:21.760 --> 43:24.000
fuck boys without the whole ordination business.

43:24.800 --> 43:26.640
Waiting lists a mile long.

43:26.640 --> 43:27.520
Oh my God.

43:27.520 --> 43:27.840
Yeah.

43:27.840 --> 43:31.280
That position is like right below the Pope in terms of desirability.

43:31.280 --> 43:31.920
I mean, I'd love to.

43:31.920 --> 43:33.280
I don't have the grades.

43:33.280 --> 43:36.240
I just, I don't have the grades and on the community service, I'll never get the job.

43:36.240 --> 43:39.600
There's a whole line of dudes waiting to get that gig.

43:39.600 --> 43:40.880
Although, you know, I think about it.

43:40.880 --> 43:49.120
If your entire high school class had all been through this fucking obstacle course of sexuality,

43:49.120 --> 43:53.040
maybe it would like get a bunch of shit out of the way and then you could focus on school and stuff.

43:53.040 --> 43:59.440
Maybe this would be like the most enlightened high school class ever because they don't have to think about those things.

43:59.440 --> 43:59.920
Right.

43:59.920 --> 44:01.520
Let me check my schedule real quick.

44:01.520 --> 44:05.920
I got math first period and then I got English and then I got boners.

44:05.920 --> 44:11.600
I had boners all day, every day for an entire semester.

44:11.600 --> 44:13.520
So like I don't, I can't get boners anymore.

44:13.520 --> 44:14.160
I'm a high school student.

44:14.160 --> 44:15.760
I'm just sensitized to boners forever.

44:15.760 --> 44:16.400
Right.

44:16.400 --> 44:20.000
Sixth grade though, like girls are, you know, more developed than boys.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.280
They develop faster than boys.

44:21.280 --> 44:26.560
Wouldn't that be, you know, people worry about the girls being harassed or slut shamed or made to feel uncomfortable.

44:26.560 --> 44:29.120
Wouldn't the boys be the ones who feel uncomfortable in sixth grade?

44:29.120 --> 44:33.680
Because the girls are a foot taller than they are and dating guys in college.

44:33.680 --> 44:38.080
And there they are like still like hairless little monkeys with no hair on their nuts.

44:38.080 --> 44:40.160
Wouldn't it be mortifying for the boys?

44:40.160 --> 44:48.640
Listen, Dan, if I put off interacting with the girls until I'm sexually developed, I don't think I would have had, I wouldn't have met a woman until my late 20s.

44:48.640 --> 44:50.640
So yeah, you wouldn't be married right now.

44:50.640 --> 44:51.840
I wouldn't be married right now.

44:51.840 --> 44:52.720
Yeah.

44:52.720 --> 45:01.200
I don't think there's any age at which, I wore, I wore sweatpants all through my freshman year of high school because I didn't want to change for gym.

45:01.200 --> 45:04.160
Like, and that was, I was 14 or 15 at that point.

45:04.160 --> 45:05.360
Like, nah.

45:05.360 --> 45:14.640
Not because I was afraid of changing for gym, but I did at one point have to have someone had to sit me down and talk to me about wearing dress shirts and tear away pants as a look.

45:14.640 --> 45:19.200
So I don't think there was ever a worry about me interacting with the girl.

45:19.200 --> 45:22.880
Can I tell you something that will make you want to get in a time machine and go blow your brains out when you're 15?

45:22.880 --> 45:29.920
When I was 15, I had a girlfriend who was my older brother's ex-girlfriend and I lost my virginity in a three way.

45:29.920 --> 45:31.200
Damn.

45:31.200 --> 45:34.880
So I was doing well with the ladies at 15 because I didn't give a shit.

45:34.880 --> 45:37.040
I was like, oh, all right, I guess.

45:37.040 --> 45:40.480
Just think about how many more three ways you could have been in though if you were in tear away pants.

45:40.480 --> 45:42.240
Because then there's no, you don't have to face no-

45:42.240 --> 45:43.600
At any opportunity.

45:43.600 --> 45:44.000
What are we?

45:44.000 --> 45:45.200
There's no fumbling.

45:45.200 --> 45:46.400
Yeah.

45:46.400 --> 45:48.880
That fucking pool Travis would have evacuated.

45:48.880 --> 45:54.880
At 15 I'd also mastered button and zipper technology and I could actually get my pants off when that, when the moment-

45:54.880 --> 45:57.600
Well, some of us are not all that advanced, Dan.

45:57.600 --> 45:58.080
Yeah.

45:58.080 --> 45:59.200
Travis doesn't have prehensile.

45:59.200 --> 46:03.040
Whoa, Mr. Braggy McGee coming over from his podcast and putting on zippers.

46:03.040 --> 46:05.120
Dan's so great at taking his pants off.

46:05.120 --> 46:06.160
Off and on, off and on.

46:06.160 --> 46:09.200
Just saying, you would have gotten more pussy when you were 15 if you were gay.

46:09.200 --> 46:10.000
That's all I'm saying.

46:14.160 --> 46:15.520
Advice for everyone.

46:17.280 --> 46:20.640
Dan, before we let you go, is there anything we can help you with?

46:20.640 --> 46:23.360
I have to find that unfathomable, but okay.

46:23.360 --> 46:24.560
I had girlfriends when I was 15.

46:24.560 --> 46:25.360
I had sex with girls.

46:26.160 --> 46:28.160
I never performed cunnilingus.

46:28.160 --> 46:32.160
And if there's, you know, say I get arrested, I get thrown in prison and the men's prisons

46:32.160 --> 46:36.400
are full and I'm sent to a women's prison and there's some like bizarre set of circumstances

46:36.400 --> 46:38.640
under which I am required to perform cunnilingus.

46:38.640 --> 46:39.760
How do you do that?

46:40.320 --> 46:40.880
Yeah.

46:40.880 --> 46:41.380
Okay.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.440
I like to play like I'm a DJ.

46:44.640 --> 46:47.200
The DJ is not, we're not doing that again.

46:47.200 --> 46:48.640
We're not going to the DJ.

46:48.640 --> 46:49.280
Let me ask you something.

46:49.280 --> 46:53.840
Did you, Dan, did you listen to, did you listen to the radio at all in the 90s?

46:54.480 --> 46:54.720
I did.

46:54.720 --> 46:58.400
There was a man named, there was a, I asked because there was a man named John Popper

46:58.400 --> 47:01.680
who was the front man for a band called Blues Traveler.

47:01.680 --> 47:09.600
And the way that he does his thing on a harmonica is basically like that, except it's like sideways.

47:09.600 --> 47:13.840
So are you telling me, are you, are you advising our friend Dan that should he be

47:13.840 --> 47:16.000
in this alternate universe?

47:16.000 --> 47:20.400
Which frankly sounds a lot like a lot of the slash fiction I've read over the years.

47:20.400 --> 47:22.480
The women, the men's prison was all full.

47:22.480 --> 47:29.600
I was the only dude and you're saying he should blow into the vagina like John Popper.

47:29.600 --> 47:30.800
Close your eyes.

47:30.800 --> 47:37.200
Close your eyes and imagine the bridge from Hook, the Blues Traveler song Hook.

47:38.160 --> 47:39.920
I will try, I will try my best.

47:39.920 --> 47:43.520
You could also close your eyes and imagine the final battle from the movie Hook

47:43.520 --> 47:44.960
and just do that as well.

47:44.960 --> 47:47.760
Peter Pan versus Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook.

47:47.760 --> 47:53.280
Now let me tell you this, women hate it when you shout bangarang into their vaginas.

47:53.280 --> 47:57.200
That is, that is, as long as you don't do that really, you should be fine.

47:57.200 --> 47:57.840
You should be fine.

47:58.720 --> 47:59.600
Anything else goes.

48:00.880 --> 48:01.840
I will do what I can.

48:02.400 --> 48:04.000
Also start gentle ramp up.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.920
Maybe they do when you shout bangarang.

48:05.920 --> 48:08.640
This is better advice than a bisexual friend of mine gave who said,

48:08.640 --> 48:11.200
just pretend you're trying to extract a bullet from a wound.

48:11.200 --> 48:14.720
Oh my God.

48:14.720 --> 48:18.720
Pretend that your lady's vagina has just been bitten by a cobra.

48:19.280 --> 48:20.320
Suck that venom out.

48:20.880 --> 48:21.760
Get that venom out.

48:22.400 --> 48:23.440
She's got to live, damn it.

48:23.440 --> 48:26.080
Pretend the clit is a bullet and you are, without using your teeth,

48:26.080 --> 48:29.600
trying to remove it from this gunshot wound that is her business.

48:30.240 --> 48:32.880
That parenthetical in there is so vital.

48:32.880 --> 48:33.840
It's so important.

48:34.480 --> 48:36.000
Do not actually try to remove it.

48:36.720 --> 48:38.080
It's in there for a reason.

48:38.080 --> 48:38.560
Unless.

48:39.120 --> 48:39.760
Unless.

48:39.760 --> 48:40.320
Unless.

48:40.320 --> 48:43.600
Unless, you know, everybody likes something different.

48:43.600 --> 48:44.320
That's true.

48:44.320 --> 48:46.160
You just got to ask her, your friend of Jimmy's.

48:46.160 --> 48:48.880
Yeah, I was going to say she could be my Aunt Jimmy.

48:52.880 --> 48:56.080
I mean, when we have the opportunity, do we have any advice?

48:56.080 --> 48:57.600
Dan, I have a question for you.

48:57.600 --> 49:01.280
The three of us were raised Southern Baptist.

49:03.280 --> 49:03.680
I know.

49:03.680 --> 49:08.160
Our parents are wonderful people and they taught us a lot of good stuff.

49:08.160 --> 49:14.080
But in terms of becoming, I guess, what's the what's the word I'm looking for?

49:14.080 --> 49:19.760
Modern in our approach to sexuality, we kind of all had to learn the hard way

49:20.320 --> 49:25.280
in getting rid of a lot of the teachings, lessons that we learn,

49:25.280 --> 49:27.600
like from especially from that religious background.

49:27.600 --> 49:28.480
The Beatitudes.

49:28.480 --> 49:30.560
The Beatitudes, for example.

49:30.560 --> 49:36.080
Like, is there a better path to getting out, like to unlearning those lessons

49:36.080 --> 49:39.360
rather than just looking like a dumb ass enough until it gets through?

49:39.360 --> 49:42.320
Well, I think when it comes to men raised in the Southern Baptist tradition,

49:42.320 --> 49:46.480
the quickest way to help them unlearn a lot of the sex phobia and hangups

49:46.480 --> 49:49.840
and slut shaming and double standards is to bend them over the sofa

49:49.840 --> 49:52.960
and fuck them in the ass really hard with a strap on dildo.

49:52.960 --> 49:54.320
Is there an option B?

49:56.400 --> 49:58.240
Hey, listen, I'm not ruling anything out.

49:58.240 --> 49:59.280
I'm going to change.

49:59.280 --> 50:00.800
I'm going to change.

50:00.800 --> 50:02.000
I want to do whatever it takes.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.400
You know, option B is just get out there in the world and live your life

50:04.400 --> 50:06.000
and you'll encounter all sorts of different people

50:06.000 --> 50:09.600
who disprove a lot of the bullshit that you're taught in your faith tradition.

50:09.600 --> 50:10.320
You know, I was raised Catholic.

50:10.320 --> 50:11.360
I was taught a lot of bullshit, too.

50:12.400 --> 50:15.840
And you get out there in the world and you realize that it's not as simple

50:15.840 --> 50:20.800
or as cut and dried or black and white or Jesus likes this and Jesus doesn't like that

50:20.800 --> 50:23.760
as your parents and your preachers and teachers led you to believe.

50:23.760 --> 50:25.120
It's a quick learning process.

50:25.760 --> 50:28.960
I think Justin's hoping for a sort of a safe environment

50:28.960 --> 50:31.360
where you can do this and maybe get it over within a week.

50:31.360 --> 50:35.440
Maybe like maybe like some sort of camp experience where it's San Francisco.

50:35.440 --> 50:38.080
There should be like camps for straight guys in San Francisco

50:38.080 --> 50:41.760
where you just get dropped off in a speedo at the corner of Market and Castro

50:42.320 --> 50:47.920
on a Friday night and you have to fight your way back to your hotel in San Diego

50:47.920 --> 50:49.360
without any help from anybody.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.040
Just go nuts.

50:51.040 --> 50:52.720
A strength survivor will probably.

50:52.720 --> 50:53.440
You just have to.

50:54.000 --> 50:54.560
That's right.

50:54.560 --> 50:56.000
It's like the new Hunger Games.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.120
I would watch that.

50:57.120 --> 51:03.280
You will have your eyes and your thighs opened for you, Dan Savage.

51:03.280 --> 51:06.080
Thank you so, so, so much for joining us.

51:06.080 --> 51:07.200
It was a genuine treat.

51:07.200 --> 51:09.360
You're the second guest we've ever had after our dad.

51:10.080 --> 51:13.680
And the only one who didn't ejaculate all three of you into the world.

51:13.680 --> 51:14.080
I feel.

51:14.080 --> 51:16.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:16.320 --> 51:17.440
The only one.

51:17.440 --> 51:19.280
You're our first non-ejaculate guest.

51:19.280 --> 51:20.160
Let me posit this.

51:20.800 --> 51:21.280
Didn't you?

51:22.160 --> 51:23.440
Oh, yes.

51:23.440 --> 51:27.040
Dan, thank you so much.

51:27.680 --> 51:28.160
Thank you, guys.

51:28.160 --> 51:29.120
My pleasure.

51:29.120 --> 51:32.720
Thank you so much to Dan Savage for joining us.

51:32.720 --> 51:34.080
That was such a treat.

51:34.080 --> 51:38.160
And you know, he only does that because we're members of the Maximum Fun Network.

51:40.160 --> 51:42.000
If we weren't, he wouldn't have a time.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.040
He's a big deal.

51:43.040 --> 51:44.640
He wouldn't have a time of day for us.

51:44.640 --> 51:48.080
If you don't believe us, try getting him on the horn and getting him on your fucking podcast.

51:48.080 --> 51:50.000
You can't do it if you don't carry that cache.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.840
Okay, he is a very, very brand aware person.

51:54.880 --> 51:56.960
Dan Savage cares about one thing, labels.

51:58.080 --> 52:00.320
Super, super-duper appreciate Dan joining us.

52:00.320 --> 52:03.120
That was a real thrill for us.

52:03.680 --> 52:06.240
And this is the kind of stuff that happens on the Maximum Fun Network.

52:06.240 --> 52:11.600
And you could be supporting it right now by going to MaximumFun.org forward slash donate.

52:11.600 --> 52:14.800
And just donating a few bucks a month, kick us a few bucks.

52:14.800 --> 52:21.600
Ten bucks for that earbud and bonus content, or 20 bucks for lots of things for your vagina

52:21.600 --> 52:22.560
and your butt.

52:22.560 --> 52:26.960
And 35 to get drunk enough to try using Butt Lube, you know?

52:27.920 --> 52:28.560
And here's the thing.

52:29.120 --> 52:33.760
In all of this, as with our podcast, you are our best marketing tool.

52:33.760 --> 52:37.840
So if you are already a donor, if you already support, great.

52:37.840 --> 52:38.640
Thank you so much.

52:38.640 --> 52:42.400
Now go tell all your friends on Facebook and Twitter, say, hey, I'm a donor.

52:42.400 --> 52:42.960
Why aren't you?

52:42.960 --> 52:44.800
You, I know you listen to this, Jimmy.

52:44.800 --> 52:46.160
We've listened to it together.

52:46.160 --> 52:49.200
And now you're pirating it because you have the chance to support this network.

52:49.200 --> 52:49.840
And you're not.

52:49.840 --> 52:54.240
There are only two kinds of Maximum Fun listeners, donors and thieves.

52:54.800 --> 52:55.360
Which one?

52:56.560 --> 52:58.240
I was going to go with donors or boners.

52:58.880 --> 53:00.480
Donors or boners.

53:00.480 --> 53:01.360
2013.

53:01.360 --> 53:03.600
Which one do you want to be?

53:03.600 --> 53:07.600
Only two kinds of listeners come out of my brother, my brother and me.

53:07.600 --> 53:09.040
Donors and boners.

53:09.040 --> 53:10.000
Which one are you, son?

53:10.000 --> 53:11.680
What's that voice you're doing?

53:11.680 --> 53:13.600
I it was supposed to be like an army drill sergeant.

53:15.280 --> 53:17.920
But I don't know what it was exactly.

53:18.480 --> 53:22.960
Also, stoners, donors and boners and stoners who meant to donate but forgot.

53:25.600 --> 53:26.240
Oh, shit.

53:26.240 --> 53:26.800
I missed that.

53:26.800 --> 53:27.440
Two weeks.

53:27.440 --> 53:29.040
When's that pledge drive, dude?

53:30.160 --> 53:31.200
It's July.

53:31.840 --> 53:33.360
You missed it completely.

53:33.360 --> 53:35.280
You've been asleep for four months.

53:36.640 --> 53:37.680
Stoners are riffing.

53:37.680 --> 53:39.840
Rip Van Winkles.

53:39.840 --> 53:42.960
Just stoners and boners and donors and Rip Van Winkles.

53:43.760 --> 53:45.440
And gypsies and tramps and thieves.

53:47.040 --> 53:51.680
So on top of the three levels that we've we've described at length, there are other

53:51.680 --> 53:59.360
higher levels if you're a high roller and you want the dopest that our network has to

53:59.360 --> 54:00.880
offer gift wise.

54:00.880 --> 54:05.200
There is if you want to drop a hundo per month, you can be a member of Jesse's Golden Eagles

54:05.200 --> 54:11.760
where you are initiated into the inner circle, which is a club that discusses comedy, music,

54:11.760 --> 54:12.960
art and culture.

54:13.680 --> 54:18.160
And basically what that means is is the host of Max Fund programs.

54:18.160 --> 54:21.760
We will curate our favorite work each month and we will share it with you.

54:22.560 --> 54:24.000
The inner circle member.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.960
It's basically like comedy Illuminati, which almost rhymes.

54:27.840 --> 54:35.040
You also get the rocks, glasses and the vibrator and the earbuds and the lube and the digital

54:35.040 --> 54:35.920
content.

54:35.920 --> 54:38.640
But you also get to be a member of a secret society.

54:38.640 --> 54:41.360
If you want to go even higher, there's a two hundred dollar per month.

54:41.360 --> 54:46.720
Jordan's Platinum Angels, which gets you all that shit and free registration for fucking

54:46.720 --> 54:50.800
Boat Party Bizz for the Atlantic Ocean Comedy and Music Festival.

54:50.800 --> 54:55.200
It's a cruise that goes to the Bahamas with everyone who's ever been funny.

54:56.000 --> 54:59.520
You could trip to the Bahamas for listening to podcasts.

54:59.520 --> 55:00.400
Think about it.

55:00.400 --> 55:05.520
Listen, you can fucking hang out with Maria Bamford and John Hodgman and Josie Long and

55:05.520 --> 55:08.720
Marc Maron and Eugene Merman and go to the fucking Bahamas.

55:09.920 --> 55:14.080
Anyway, I got heated there for a second because it made me angry that I wasn't going to do

55:14.080 --> 55:14.560
that.

55:14.560 --> 55:15.440
But fuck.

55:15.440 --> 55:16.240
But you could.

55:16.240 --> 55:19.280
But you could because it sounds you could do something so cool that I'm not allowed

55:19.280 --> 55:19.760
to do it.

55:19.760 --> 55:20.800
That is how cool this thing is.

55:21.360 --> 55:22.240
It is very cool.

55:22.240 --> 55:25.680
So please go to maximumfund.org forward slash donate.

55:26.240 --> 55:28.240
Give support our show.

55:28.240 --> 55:30.320
It really does mean the world to us.

55:30.320 --> 55:32.160
We're trying to get a thousand new donors this year.

55:32.160 --> 55:34.080
We've done it, I think, two years in a row.

55:34.080 --> 55:34.800
We've swung it.

55:35.440 --> 55:40.480
Also, for every new donor, you can we have challenge donors who donate, like, you know,

55:40.480 --> 55:43.120
a quarter or whatever, based on how many new donors we get.

55:43.120 --> 55:45.360
So it's around six bucks a month for every new donor.

55:45.360 --> 55:46.240
So it's huge.

55:46.240 --> 55:47.920
It's that's enormous because that adds up.

55:47.920 --> 55:50.400
If we get a thousand new donors, that's an extra six thousand bucks a month.

55:52.000 --> 55:56.720
Everybody who tweets a link to our donate page with the hashtag maxfunddrive, you get

55:56.720 --> 56:01.520
entered into a giveaway to win a trip to Los Angeles and a tour of Max Fund headquarters.

56:01.520 --> 56:02.400
The best tweet wins.

56:02.400 --> 56:03.680
So that's awesome.

56:03.680 --> 56:04.400
Yeah, it's huge.

56:04.400 --> 56:04.960
It's awesome.

56:04.960 --> 56:07.520
So because I've been tweeting a lot.

56:07.520 --> 56:08.160
Absolutely not.

56:08.160 --> 56:09.280
We're doing a lot of shit this year.

56:10.400 --> 56:13.840
I know it's weird because we, you know, we do this annually.

56:13.840 --> 56:14.880
We don't do it every week.

56:14.880 --> 56:18.000
I know it's weird to hear us asking for for money.

56:18.000 --> 56:22.800
But like, seriously, it means the world that the people out there who donate donate like

56:22.800 --> 56:26.480
to support us doing this fucking thing that we do every week.

56:26.480 --> 56:30.320
I mean, I don't want to make it sound like we just fucking fart and a podcast comes out.

56:30.320 --> 56:34.240
Like, you know, it takes it takes it takes work, but it's still at the end of the day

56:34.880 --> 56:36.800
fucking goofing off with my my bros.

56:36.800 --> 56:40.720
So like, seriously, think about supporting if you listen.

56:40.720 --> 56:44.400
And I just thank you.

56:44.400 --> 56:45.120
Thank you so much.

56:45.840 --> 56:46.640
Questions.

56:47.840 --> 56:48.400
I got them.

56:49.440 --> 56:51.200
That's a new bed I've been working on.

56:51.200 --> 56:54.560
OK, like a bed that you do whenever you have questions.

56:54.560 --> 56:56.560
OK, I got them.

56:57.600 --> 56:58.800
Answers.

56:58.800 --> 56:59.440
You want them.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.760
It's my brother, my brother and me.

57:01.760 --> 57:02.480
It's a show.

57:02.480 --> 57:03.440
It's a podcast.

57:03.440 --> 57:06.240
It's a pyramid scheme.

57:07.040 --> 57:11.600
OK, don't tell anybody.

57:14.960 --> 57:20.080
I shouldn't have put that in the jingle and then the podcast made off with my money.

57:20.080 --> 57:20.960
Yeah, thank you.

57:20.960 --> 57:22.480
I've been working on that one for a couple of years.

57:22.480 --> 57:25.680
I said that podcast priest everything I had.

57:26.320 --> 57:30.560
My boyfriend of five months recently asked if I would help him deep clean his apartment.

57:31.120 --> 57:35.440
He seemed hurt by my immediate response of clean your own damn place, dude.

57:35.440 --> 57:38.560
To be fair, he did not ask me to clean for him.

57:38.560 --> 57:41.680
He just asked if I would be willing to help out as a favor.

57:41.680 --> 57:46.480
I have to admit his place is gross and I would love it if it was less so.

57:46.480 --> 57:50.080
But I can't help feeling weird about scrubbing my boyfriend's toilet.

57:50.080 --> 57:55.440
Was my response unreasonable? Should I be down with the idea of helping him clean his place?

57:55.440 --> 57:57.680
That's from perplexed in Portland.

57:57.680 --> 57:59.920
How about you don't scrub his toilet?

57:59.920 --> 58:02.480
How about you just clean his stove?

58:02.480 --> 58:03.760
He handles toilet, dude.

58:03.760 --> 58:08.480
I would never, ever, ever want someone else to clean my house.

58:09.360 --> 58:11.680
Where did you put everything I need?

58:11.680 --> 58:12.240
I don't know.

58:12.240 --> 58:14.480
I put it in a cabinet somewhere.

58:14.480 --> 58:19.200
Not just that, but like, I hope you enjoyed touching my fecal particles because it's not

58:19.200 --> 58:21.040
just, guess what, doesn't just live in the toilet.

58:21.040 --> 58:26.000
There's more of his fecal particles on his stove than in his toilet, which is horrifying.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.080
You need to ask him what he's been doing there.

58:28.080 --> 58:29.600
Why is he pooping on his stove?

58:29.600 --> 58:30.880
It's a great question, Travis.

58:30.880 --> 58:31.680
Thank you.

58:31.680 --> 58:33.600
Thank you, Travis, for asking the big question.

58:33.600 --> 58:34.400
The big, hard question.

58:34.400 --> 58:36.320
We're not afraid to ask the big question to you.

58:36.320 --> 58:37.920
Why are you pooping on your stove, Dylan?

58:37.920 --> 58:39.760
They're afraid to answer them or look at them.

58:40.560 --> 58:42.800
I, I, you gotta say no.

58:42.800 --> 58:43.760
This sucks.

58:43.760 --> 58:45.360
It sucks that he put you in this position.

58:45.360 --> 58:46.240
Now, hold on.

58:46.240 --> 58:50.560
Don't you think it could be like Breaking 2, Electric Boogaloo, kind of like a montage,

58:50.560 --> 58:53.520
cleaning, getting to know you, happy fun times?

58:53.520 --> 58:57.440
Get those cobwebs off the ceiling fan by dancing upwards onto the ceiling.

58:57.440 --> 59:01.520
I'm just saying that in every movie where you see people like cleaning up a new space,

59:01.520 --> 59:05.440
they found everybody seems so happy and they're growing closer as friends.

59:05.440 --> 59:09.920
Fuck me on these old pizza boxes at the end of the montage.

59:09.920 --> 59:13.520
We've been cleaning so long for so hard, we're real sweaty.

59:13.520 --> 59:14.960
Fuck me on these pizza boxes.

59:14.960 --> 59:18.560
Do that thing where you paint on his nose.

59:18.560 --> 59:19.520
You know with the roller?

59:19.520 --> 59:20.800
You're like, oh, you got me.

59:21.520 --> 59:21.920
You know what?

59:21.920 --> 59:25.120
Oh, and camera tricks may look like you're painting over the camera.

59:25.120 --> 59:26.160
Yo, I love that.

59:26.160 --> 59:27.360
I love that move.

59:27.360 --> 59:27.920
You know what?

59:27.920 --> 59:31.120
I would, I would be so mad if somebody painted on my nose.

59:31.120 --> 59:32.560
I don't care how little we are.

59:32.560 --> 59:34.160
Do you know how hard it is to get this shit off?

59:34.160 --> 59:38.400
I know it's latex and it'll like peel off, but still, you made me look like a fucking moron.

59:38.400 --> 59:42.080
It happens in Benjamin Button and they, it's him and-

59:42.080 --> 59:42.800
Cate Blanchett.

59:42.800 --> 59:47.680
Cate Blanchett, the love interest in Benjamin Button, and he paints on her nose and I thought,

59:48.240 --> 59:50.560
you, man, what an asshole.

59:50.560 --> 59:51.840
That's your day.

59:51.840 --> 59:53.360
That's your whole fucking day.

59:53.360 --> 59:56.240
You know when like somebody pinches your nose and it hurts like shit?

59:56.240 --> 59:59.280
Like it hurts when you apply any amount of pressure to your nose whatsoever?

59:59.280 --> 01:00:01.120
You gotta scrub that shit to get it off.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.000
You gotta use lye.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.880
He should not have asked.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.000
It was incorrect.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.360
It was a miscalculation to ask because like, no.

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:12.080
Five months?

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:12.640
Yeah. Okay.

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:13.120
Here's the thing.

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:13.440
I agree.

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.080
Cause it's one thing.

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:18.000
You feel like you volunteer like, hey, maybe pick this place up.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:18.960
I'm happy to help.

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:19.520
It's another thing.

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.760
You'd be like, oh man, my place is a dump.

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.120
My turlet needs grouting.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.000
Grout my turlet.

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.400
No, it does.

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:26.800
Okay.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:32.000
But on the flip side of this, if you spend any sort of time there, a considerable amount

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.800
of time, then, you know, if you guys are like splitting living places, I think it's a fair

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:40.320
request to ask, you know, to ask you to pitch in.

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.240
Why is this fucking place so dirty?

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:44.000
Why isn't he fucking cleaning himself?

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.960
It's one thing to be like, hey, we make dinner together.

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.400
Let's do the dishes together.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:52.080
It's another to be like, man, I've been living in squalor for like six months.

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.600
Well, he could find a way to work around.

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.720
Help me throw out everything that I've been hoarding.

01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:02.240
I know you've used this turlet as well during your five months where you've been over here.

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:06.880
So would it really kill you to help us both out?

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:08.640
You're really doing us both a favor by scrubbing my turlet.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.880
Well, is he going to help you clean up your apartment?

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:12.240
Oh, she doesn't.

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.040
She doesn't need that.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:14.320
Okay.

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.800
So then I think that she doesn't need to help him.

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:17.040
Yeah.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.000
She doesn't need to help him.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.680
Tell those messy ass that you're not coming over anymore until he cleans up.

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:22.000
Period.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:22.720
Yeah.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:23.760
Just saying no scrubs.

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.920
No scrubs until you scrubs.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:35.920
Tell him to creep to the hardware store.

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:39.040
Where do they sell cleaning supplies?

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:44.560
Tell him to make a waterfall of scrubbing bubbles.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.080
I don't know what even the cleaning supplies are called.

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.960
Have you cleaned stuff before?

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.600
I don't produce any waste.

01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:01.760
I've managed to streamline my life so much that I don't produce any waste in any format.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:02.960
No oils.

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:04.800
My body doesn't produce any natural oils.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:06.800
No sweats.

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:08.560
I mean, I don't.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:12.560
I haven't evacuated in like 15 years is what I'm saying.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.560
I am so sick.

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:22.320
Listen, this whole podcast is just a cry for help, you guys.

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:24.880
Belly's the size of a sumo wheelbag.

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:28.400
It's not a cry for help, Travis, because I can't cry is what I'm saying.

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.320
I keep it inside.

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:36.560
I managed to exude all of my body's natural toxins through a vapor.

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:43.120
We should be introducing ourselves as your oldest, your middlest, and your lumpiest.

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:45.120
Your most unsettlingly lumpiest.

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.000
Your most jaundiced.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.520
Well, the lumps are just my toxin sacs, which is where I exude.

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:50.080
No problem.

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:53.440
And that's how Griffin became a Batman villain.

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:54.640
Do not touch them.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.280
Oh my God.

01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:01.520
I know I produce a natural rattling noise that sparks the cure,

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:02.880
that piques the curiosity.

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:06.240
He often lures in small children that way.

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:08.640
I got a question for you guys.

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:11.600
I'm going to be caught in between two jobs in a month or so.

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:15.920
I plan on relocating to a different state at the end of the summer where my girlfriend

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:20.240
is starting grad school and will be continuing my civil engineering career there.

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:24.720
However, at my current company, people are resigning left and right, indicating a sinking

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:25.220
ship.

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:29.040
I have a suspicion that I'll have the summer free.

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.560
My question is this.

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:35.440
What can I do for three months that can still put food on the table, but has only a short

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:36.720
term commitment?

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:40.080
I'm an outdoorsy, numbers nerd, and amateur tinkerer.

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:43.920
That's from Future Carney in Chicago.

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.040
OK, you want to know a secret?

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:45.760
Hit me.

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:46.560
Anything.

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:46.960
Yeah.

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:47.680
Let me hold on.

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:55.120
Let me go ahead and type your metrics here into the job assistant that places you.

01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:58.880
So outdoorsy, numbers nerd, amateur tinkerer.

01:03:58.880 --> 01:03:59.380
Hmm.

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:00.880
Subway.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:01.840
Just go work at Subway.

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:04.560
Not on the subway, at a Subway.

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:05.840
Subway sandwich shop.

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:07.520
You too can be a sandwich artist.

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:09.520
Here's the important thing.

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:14.320
No matter what interview you go into, you just want to keep that three month time limit

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:15.520
right in your pocket.

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:16.720
Do not pull that move out.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:19.840
I see a big future for myself here at the Walgreens.

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:25.520
I got some big ideas about how you guys can change up the way that you sell your operating

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:25.840
chips.

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:27.440
Where do you see yourself in five years?

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:28.720
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:29.760
Let's scale that back.

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.000
Where do I see myself in 10?

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:33.120
Here?

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.080
Did you guess here?

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:35.520
Because the answer is here.

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.960
At Walgreens, I love it.

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.320
I'm never going anywhere.

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:41.840
I don't have kids, but when I do, they're going to work at Walgreens.

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:42.560
This Walgreens.

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:43.920
I want it to be a family business.

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:53.360
The important thing is that one ploy you can take is found a softball league, an intro

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:58.080
Walgreens softball league, literally weeks before you are to resign.

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:04.000
Because then you can really quit saying like, I don't, I mean, I can't leave you guys right

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:04.400
now.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:04.960
It's too.

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:06.640
We got inventory coming up.

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:09.760
There's the division playoffs against CVS.

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:10.480
Like, I don't know.

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:16.240
I don't know how we can, how I can leave now or maybe like drama, organize everyone.

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:18.000
It's like a Walgreens union.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
And then just before the strike, you quit.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.040
You did.

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:25.440
I'm the sacrifice that this Walgreens demands.

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:26.720
I'm sorry.

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:28.000
You'll have to go on without me.

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:31.440
I have to go into hiding like Batman at the end of Dark Knight.

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.040
Remember the lessons I've taught you.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:40.320
I am not the cashier that this Walgreens deserves, but I'm the one it no longer has.

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:40.640
Bye.

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:47.840
I actually, I worked at a, I worked at a Jimmy John's in Norman, Oklahoma, knowing that,

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:51.040
you know, the school year is about to end and I was about to go home.

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:56.960
And it provides a lot of psychological freedom because like, if your boss yells at you for

01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:01.040
doing something wrong or like they work you a terrible shift or something, it's like,

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:04.080
yeah, but in your head, you know that fuck that place.

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:07.440
I don't want to put you on Blasthouse, but weren't you fired from that Jimmy John's?

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:10.400
No, they actually wanted to make me an assistant manager and I left.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:13.440
I have been fired from a lot of places, Griffin.

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:13.680
Yeah.

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.920
So I understand why that is a safe assumption.

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:16.480
I got it matched up.

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:19.120
So this Jimmy John's, do anything you want to.

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:20.960
This is a great time for you.

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:24.640
Do write, do a job for three months that you can write a book about.

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:27.600
I think that there's too many ex-Subway employees.

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:32.640
Maybe that book's being pitched all over, like Memories of a Subway Artists and just

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:35.680
people like, no, we already have 20 of those manuscripts.

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:37.920
A lot of those in the hopper.

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:40.960
A lot of those are cooking up in pre and post-production.

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:44.240
Now if you could write a Subway based movie, now we're talking.

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.760
Now we get, now you're quickly asking.

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:48.000
There already is a fucking Subway TV show.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.840
I see ads on it for Hulu all the time.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:51.840
You know about this?

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:52.640
What, sorry?

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:54.480
It's called, I think it's called The Nine to Fivers.

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:58.560
It's a Hulu only TV show as all the best television programming is.

01:06:59.200 --> 01:06:59.760
Good job.

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:03.360
And it's about people who work at Subway and it's not like fun way.

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:04.480
It's not like an offshoot.

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:07.440
It's fucking legit to quit Subway.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:07.760
It seems like-

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:09.040
Sponsored by Subway.

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.400
It seems like a pretty good show.

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:11.440
I'd probably watch that show.

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:12.160
It's pretty good.

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:17.040
It's all about, you know, love, life, making sandwiches, of course.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:23.360
There's a, there's a lot of commercials for Hulu based programs that don't,

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:25.040
that, I don't know, that look pretty good.

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:27.840
I saw a lot of commercials from where I've been, been-

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:29.280
Watching real shows?

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.080
Watching real shows.

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:30.800
Watching real television shows.

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:32.000
We got fake shows on here.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.320
Yeah, do you know how they pay for all those fake shows?

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:34.800
How?

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.040
Because they have a fucking show that's all about Subway.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:39.840
They have Subway programming.

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:41.840
Anyway, it makes me so angry.

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:43.440
I have a Yahoo answer.

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:45.360
If you guys don't mind the leap.

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:47.760
Maybe this will calm, calm my nerves.

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:49.440
It's sent in by Emily Wall.

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:49.760
Thank you.

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:52.000
It's by Yahoo answer user, Layla Bell, who asks,

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:55.760
I'm a cat person and so is my friend.

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.920
We understand each other's meows and other sounds.

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:00.560
Wait, hold on.

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:01.840
When in the dark, we are cat.

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.040
Wait a minute.

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:05.760
Holy shit.

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:06.480
Wait.

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:10.480
I actually, this is so weird because when you said the phrase, I am a cat person,

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:14.640
my first thought was I've been doing this show too long because I know what this person means

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.560
is they're a person who likes to own cats.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.320
I hear like I'm a half cat, half person.

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:19.040
I tried to-

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.000
When in fact-

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.960
I tried to vocalize the hyphen in between cat and person.

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:27.120
I am a cat person.

01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:29.920
When in the dark, we are cat.

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:31.600
But in the light, we are human.

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:34.880
My friend has sharp cat-like teeth, but I'm less obvious.

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:38.400
We don't change shape, but we lose complete control and go cat.

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:41.380
Please.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.360
If anyone has info on this or has the same experience, fill us in.

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:46.160
Okay.

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:47.040
So they want help.

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:47.840
How do we fix it?

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:48.720
We can't help it.

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:49.440
Oh my God.

01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:50.560
I don't want to fix it.

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.880
I want to hang.

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:54.000
I just want to hang.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:54.500
Yeah.

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.040
Can we get one hang going, please?

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.560
But here's the thing, Justin.

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:02.560
Think about the reality of that situation because let's be honest, lights, you know,

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:06.080
the lights go dim and you're just watching a fucking real person.

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:06.880
Well, you're not watching.

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:08.080
Oh, now I'm a cat.

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:12.480
Travis, if you can see them, if there's enough light to see them-

01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:13.280
Hold on.

01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:14.560
They're human beings.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.800
So even if you were doing like night vision goggles.

01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:18.960
See, that's the only way.

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:21.680
That's the only way you can observe these fools in their natural environment.

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:25.440
What cruel fate to be in a room.

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:27.200
It's like Lady Hawk, you know?

01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:30.320
Like you're in a room with a cat person, but you can't-

01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:35.280
You can only see them as person because they can't really like go ham with the lights on.

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:36.480
You need night vision goggles.

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:38.000
You got to have NVGs.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:38.320
That is a secret weapon.

01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:42.880
Unless it's like a Cal Mitchell in real life.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.720
Cal Mitchell is only Cal Mitchell when he's being naturally observed.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.440
Otherwise he is Kenan Thompson.

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:52.560
Otherwise- Oh no.

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:54.720
I don't think that's it.

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:58.400
Although I've never seen them in the same room at the same time.

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:01.760
That's why the show is called Kenan slash Cal.

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:02.880
Kenan or Cal.

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:04.160
Do you watch Kenan or Cal?

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.680
Kenan by way of Cal.

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:12.080
Kenan stroke Cal.

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:16.880
Oh man, this situation.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:17.600
Oh man.

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:24.240
I just want to know what it's like to be in a room with two people that you think are otherwise

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:25.120
people people.

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.480
Person persons.

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:28.400
Not cat persons, just person persons.

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:29.840
And then the lights go off and you're like-

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.440
Oh, there's a power surge.

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:33.040
Why does this sound like you're pooping in a box?

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:33.920
Where's my milk?

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:34.960
Where's my milk?

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:35.840
Where did it go?

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.920
Sounds like it's being lapped, but that's weird.

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:39.040
I don't have a cat.

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.480
I only have two people peoples.

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.880
This is a strange situation I'm in.

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:44.560
I think I'd like to leave.

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:46.240
You can't leave.

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.520
I think I'd like to leave this room.

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:48.000
Where's the door?

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:48.560
I can't see it.

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.320
The door, the door, because the lights are off.

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:52.160
Here's the terrifying thing.

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:56.880
They can see you because as cats, they have superb dark vision.

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:58.080
So they're hunting you now.

01:10:58.080 --> 01:10:59.040
I have cat eyes.

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:00.080
You're the prey.

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:00.800
They're the predator.

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:01.840
They're the predator.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:02.640
I can't.

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:03.280
It's like if-

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:04.560
What's that to your left?

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:06.080
I mean, it's bright in my room.

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:07.520
My real cat is outside.

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:08.960
Maybe he's a person when it's dark.

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:10.320
That would suck.

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:12.160
That would suck if that happened.

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:17.520
If there was like a two second window where the power goes out and it comes back on and

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:19.680
there's just a fucking dude on my couch just like,

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:23.120
sup, meow, he changes just like that.

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:24.880
I would be fucking freaked.

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.600
I would move out.

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:26.960
The house is yours now, Cecil.

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:27.520
I'm done.

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:29.120
This one's yours.

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.960
You are welcome, Stephen King.

01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:37.440
Hope that you send us a check when you make this into a book and a movie and a play and

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:38.400
another movie.

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:44.000
If you're going to fucking LARP an animorph, which if I had said that sentence 10 years

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.920
ago to anybody, I would be committed to an insane asylum.

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:49.200
Pretty much right away.

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:53.280
But now, thanks to Yahoo Answers, I can fucking crack that cipher.

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:58.560
If I were to LARP an animorph, why would you go with a fucking domesticated house cat and

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:00.240
not a more exotic animal?

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.440
Ooh, good call.

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:03.040
A more erotic animal.

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:06.080
Do they say house cat or do they just say cat?

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.440
It could be a beautiful jungle cat.

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:08.160
He's got a point.

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:12.880
And it's a sinewy, like a cougar with sinewy muscles.

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:14.000
I get it.

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:16.480
Cougars are basically land dolphins.

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:19.680
I understand.

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:20.720
Okay, listen.

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.160
Slick one of those bad boys up and you...

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.120
Listen, you slick a cheetah up, you got a dolphin basically.

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.320
That's basically what you're working with.

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:32.080
Thank you all so much for listening to this podcast.

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:32.640
They can't hear us.

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.080
They're too busy jerking off right now.

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:38.240
Stop jerking it for just a second while we give you this very important message about

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:39.280
the Maximum Fun Drive.

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:43.920
It is a two-week blowout of fun and laughs.

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:46.800
Don't say blowout right after you ask them to stop jerking it.

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:48.080
You're right.

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:50.240
It's like talking about a waterfall when your friend has to pee.

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:54.320
It is a two-week festival of fun and laughs.

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:57.040
We really hope that you'll go to MaximumFun.org

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.920
slash donate and choose one of these donation levels.

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:06.560
For $10 a month, you can get those Maximum Fun earbuds that are really slick and the

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:08.560
digital content for 20 bucks.

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:10.080
A big sex pack.

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:14.400
The intimate sensations from our friends at ExtremeTrace.com.

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:16.000
The earbuds are in there.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.760
The digital content is not in there.

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:19.040
It's in the cloud, but you know.

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:21.360
Just go to MaximumFun.org slash donate.

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:24.240
It has all the details, all the prize packs.

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:29.520
By the way, to clarify on that $20 a month pack, you can, instead of the sex stuff, get

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:32.480
a Maximum Fun Rocket tee if that is more your bag.

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:33.840
Oh, so it's an option.

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.840
It's an either or situation.

01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:36.160
Okay.

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:38.000
You can do that.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.320
If you donate, thank you a lot.

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:46.000
Go to that page if you need to like migrate from, you know, a shitty credit card to, you

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.960
know, PayPal or you can change your donation options there.

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:50.400
You can also upgrade your donations.

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:52.560
If you don't donate, think about it.

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:55.760
Just if you're sitting at your computer and we've given you entertainment and you dip

01:13:55.760 --> 01:14:00.880
into all the other shows and we give you all this shit and you want to support us, that

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.000
would be the dopest.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.320
Just go to MaximumFun.org slash donate.

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:07.200
We won't belabor the point, but just think about it.

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:08.080
Just think about it.

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:09.920
That's all I ask.

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:11.120
Will you please just think about it?

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:14.720
And we want to say thank you again to Dan Savage.

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:15.280
Goddamn it.

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:19.680
Thank you for casting on the show from Savage Love and Savage Love Cast over at The Stranger.

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:23.440
So make sure you check out his shit if you haven't already because we assume that you

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:23.680
do.

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:25.760
But he's incredible and he's an awesome dude.

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:26.560
Thanks again, Dan.

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:27.120
Thank you, Dan.

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:30.720
And thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winter's for using our theme song.

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.800
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:36.640
You can find that on iTunes or Amazon, I'm sure.

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:38.400
I'm sure you can.

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.120
