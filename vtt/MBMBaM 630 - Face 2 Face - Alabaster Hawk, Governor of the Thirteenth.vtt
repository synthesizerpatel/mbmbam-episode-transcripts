00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts.

00:06.440 --> 00:09.340
And their advice should never be followed.

00:10.380 --> 00:15.320
Oh, Travis insists, Balcony, that he's a sexpert.

00:17.780 --> 00:21.260
But if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:21.260 --> 00:24.160
Also, this show isn't for kids,

00:24.160 --> 00:26.660
which I mention only so you babies out there

00:26.660 --> 00:30.700
know how cool you are for listening.

00:30.700 --> 00:33.200
What's up, you cool baby?

00:33.200 --> 00:34.340
One, two, three, four.

00:34.340 --> 00:40.100
It's the start of something beautiful.

00:40.100 --> 00:42.040
A small acquaintance has blossomed.

00:42.040 --> 00:46.520
It's ripened into a precious friendship.

00:46.520 --> 00:49.680
I could have never seen what was coming for me.

00:49.680 --> 00:52.520
Hangs at the skate park, hangs by the beach.

00:52.520 --> 00:59.500
My life, it feels like life.

00:59.500 --> 01:04.000
Ah, it's better, it's better with you.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.980
My life, ah, it's better, it's better with you.

01:09.980 --> 01:16.480
This is true, ah, it's better, it's better with two.

01:16.480 --> 01:22.960
My life, ah, it's better with you.

01:22.960 --> 01:26.300
Hello, San Diego, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother,

01:26.300 --> 01:29.560
and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

01:29.560 --> 01:32.900
I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:32.900 --> 01:43.780
And I am your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

01:43.780 --> 01:46.980
Thank you for making it louder than his.

01:46.980 --> 01:56.320
And I'm the phantom of the Balboa.

01:56.320 --> 01:58.860
That is part of the deal at Performing at the Balboa.

01:58.860 --> 02:00.760
You do have to let the phantom join the show.

02:00.760 --> 02:04.940
And you have to bring your own phantom, which is like-

02:04.940 --> 02:05.940
So they had to-

02:05.940 --> 02:06.940
Times are tough.

02:06.940 --> 02:07.940
Times are tough.

02:07.940 --> 02:11.480
They had to kill me.

02:11.480 --> 02:12.480
Had to.

02:12.480 --> 02:15.040
They made me a ghost, contractually.

02:15.040 --> 02:18.800
The hardest part was coming up with your unfinished business because you've done so much.

02:18.800 --> 02:23.620
Right now, my unfinished business is finding out what is sharp on dad's hat that stabbed

02:23.620 --> 02:26.280
me in the fucking ear when I came out here.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.240
Oh, that's the Gom Jabbar.

02:28.240 --> 02:29.240
Oh no!

02:29.240 --> 02:30.240
Oh no!

02:30.240 --> 02:31.240
Gom Jabbar!

02:31.240 --> 02:32.240
Griffin, no!

02:32.240 --> 02:33.240
Oh, sorry, this is Comic-Con.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.240
We have to explain.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.440
The Gom Jabbar-

02:36.440 --> 02:37.440
You see-

02:37.440 --> 02:38.440
In the documentary-

02:38.440 --> 02:39.440
He is the mind killer.

02:39.440 --> 02:42.920
He is the mind killer of Moon.

02:42.920 --> 02:45.560
This is Griffin's third night wearing a tuxedo.

02:45.560 --> 02:46.560
And-

02:46.560 --> 02:47.560
Well-

02:47.560 --> 02:48.560
And-

02:48.560 --> 02:49.560
And?

02:49.560 --> 02:50.560
And last.

02:50.560 --> 02:51.680
It continues to evolve.

02:51.680 --> 02:55.320
The cape without the coat is new tonight.

02:55.320 --> 02:58.440
I do hope you and Sailor Moon finally work things out.

02:58.440 --> 03:00.480
I would love that.

03:00.480 --> 03:05.280
Oh, sorry, okay.

03:05.280 --> 03:08.400
Tuxedo mask is a character-

03:08.400 --> 03:11.800
Here's the thing that is click-through that I didn't realize, Griffin putting on a tuxedo

03:11.800 --> 03:12.800
makes him-

03:12.800 --> 03:17.240
And he's already a fairly uncomfortable human being day-to-day.

03:17.240 --> 03:23.440
Him putting it on, he begins to move like Vincent D'Onofrio in Men in Black, where he's

03:23.440 --> 03:26.600
like, is this how I can't-

03:26.600 --> 03:29.080
I'm loving it.

03:29.080 --> 03:34.080
And Griffin's next-year theme is about pajamas.

03:34.080 --> 03:37.840
It makes me feel so pretty.

03:37.840 --> 03:46.720
I felt like a sexier era of Vincent D'Onofrio, where he was like a cool, smooth-

03:46.720 --> 03:48.720
How do you choose?

03:48.720 --> 03:51.000
Wait, when was that era?

03:51.000 --> 03:52.520
Was he in Full Metal Jacket?

03:52.520 --> 03:53.520
He was in Full Metal Jacket.

03:53.520 --> 03:54.520
Just because-

03:54.520 --> 03:55.520
And Full Metal Alchemist.

03:55.520 --> 03:56.520
The sequel.

03:56.520 --> 04:02.280
Not a lot of people talk about how those two things are related.

04:02.280 --> 04:06.920
Travis, just because we changed the theme does not mean you cannot continue to dress

04:06.920 --> 04:10.040
like the rich villain from a dystopian YA novel.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.040
Thank you.

04:11.040 --> 04:13.800
You can continue to rock that style.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.800
His name's Alabaster Hawk.

04:15.800 --> 04:16.800
Yeah.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.360
Governor of the 13th-

04:19.360 --> 04:20.680
Everything you guys are describing rules.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.480
Yeah, actually, it sounds pretty good.

04:22.480 --> 04:23.480
I would love that.

04:23.480 --> 04:24.480
Are you kidding me?

04:24.480 --> 04:26.400
We should have done that instead.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.880
It's not too late.

04:27.880 --> 04:30.900
We're heading towards a dystopian future faster than you think.

04:30.900 --> 04:34.480
And Travis would be a steady hand on the rudder.

04:34.480 --> 04:35.480
This is what I'm saying.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.040
Could do worse?

04:37.040 --> 04:38.040
Could do worse?

04:38.040 --> 04:39.040
Could do worse.

04:39.040 --> 04:40.040
Could do better.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.040
Could do much better.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.040
I'm not gonna lie.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.040
Could do much better.

04:43.040 --> 04:47.440
This is an advice show.

04:47.440 --> 04:48.640
You know what I would like to see?

04:48.640 --> 04:50.200
You've made me think about this now, Justin.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.260
A dystopian novel, right?

04:52.260 --> 04:55.840
But what we're in the middle of is a presidency in this dystopia where it's like, yeah, he's

04:55.840 --> 04:56.840
not the best.

04:56.840 --> 04:57.840
He's not the worst.

04:57.840 --> 04:58.840
He's not great.

04:58.840 --> 04:59.840
It's okay.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.800
We've had worse, but we've also had better dystopian presidents.

05:01.800 --> 05:07.080
This is not the setup for a longer, more political bit that Travis is workshopping.

05:07.080 --> 05:09.880
Do not sweat it.

05:09.880 --> 05:17.140
This is an advice show, and we have reemerged here in San Diego, like our friends, the Chilean

05:17.140 --> 05:19.400
miners did long before us.

05:19.400 --> 05:25.880
We have long been in hibernation here underneath the Balboa, waiting for our moment, biding

05:25.880 --> 05:26.880
our time.

05:26.880 --> 05:27.880
To strike!

05:27.880 --> 05:32.440
Will people cheer that line?

05:32.440 --> 05:39.000
Are they, I should ask you, are you cheering the callback or the tremendous effort that

05:39.000 --> 05:42.280
went into saving the ladder?

05:42.280 --> 05:43.280
That's it?

05:43.280 --> 05:46.800
Y'all just still can't believe how well that all works out?

05:46.800 --> 05:48.760
Holy shit.

05:48.760 --> 05:49.760
Are you kidding me?

05:49.760 --> 05:50.760
They all made it, I think.

05:50.760 --> 05:51.760
This is what I'm saying.

05:51.760 --> 05:55.400
There's a sliding doors universe in which we're not referencing it.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.400
No.

05:56.400 --> 06:01.440
But in our comedy podcast, how many of them would have had to not make it out for Justin

06:01.440 --> 06:06.680
to not use that, do you think?

06:06.680 --> 06:11.240
Because if, I mean, a quarter of them don't make it, still pretty good.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.200
Still not bad.

06:13.200 --> 06:18.940
I think baby Jessica messed up the percentages because the 100% of baby Jessica made it out

06:18.940 --> 06:20.440
of the well, right?

06:20.440 --> 06:21.440
Yeah.

06:21.440 --> 06:22.560
Was that right, sincere?

06:22.560 --> 06:23.560
Because I don't remember.

06:23.560 --> 06:26.560
Yeah, 100% of baby Jessica made it out of the well.

06:26.560 --> 06:27.560
Okay.

06:27.560 --> 06:28.820
Comic Con.

06:28.820 --> 06:31.000
Baby Jessica was, okay.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.880
That actually might be necessary.

06:32.880 --> 06:35.840
Anybody under the age of 32, we probably shouldn't be saying that.

06:35.840 --> 06:40.820
Imagine a world before Twitter when a child fell down a well and the entire fucking country

06:40.820 --> 06:45.600
lost its mind and cared in a non-joking way.

06:45.600 --> 06:49.360
Everyone glued to the TV, we've got to get this kid out of the well and we did.

06:49.360 --> 06:52.920
That was the last time things worked out.

06:52.920 --> 06:58.440
And originally she didn't, so I do want to say a huge thank you to Dr. Sam Beckett for

06:58.440 --> 07:00.320
quantum leaping back and saving baby Jessica.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.320
Oh, sorry.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.320
We should explain.

07:02.320 --> 07:03.320
So Dr. Sam Beckett.

07:03.320 --> 07:04.320
Quantum left.

07:04.320 --> 07:09.200
That was a short episode where he leapt in and he was like, am I crawling toward that

07:09.200 --> 07:10.760
fucking well?

07:10.760 --> 07:13.520
No, thanks.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.520
This is an advice show.

07:14.520 --> 07:18.560
Did they spend a lot of time during that with baby Jessica like, does anyone have thinner

07:18.560 --> 07:19.560
arms?

07:19.560 --> 07:20.560
Thinner, but longer.

07:20.560 --> 07:23.560
Todd has thin arms, Jim has long arms.

07:23.560 --> 07:25.880
We need someone in between.

07:25.880 --> 07:26.880
How far down was she?

07:26.880 --> 07:27.880
This?

07:27.880 --> 07:28.880
Look it up, Paul.

07:28.880 --> 07:30.080
This is an advice show.

07:30.080 --> 07:33.520
Could I have gotten her?

07:33.520 --> 07:35.080
I got long arms, Paul.

07:35.080 --> 07:38.760
Travis, I for sure think you've got, you definitely could have got.

07:38.760 --> 07:45.720
I think our stretching technology, our understanding of the human physiology has advanced so far

07:45.720 --> 07:46.720
in the last 30 years.

07:46.720 --> 07:47.720
You know who could have gotten her?

07:47.720 --> 07:49.320
I have a baby Jessica report for you guys.

07:49.320 --> 07:50.320
Yeah?

07:50.320 --> 07:51.320
22 feet.

07:51.320 --> 07:52.320
Okay.

07:52.320 --> 07:55.320
So just, just out of my reach.

07:55.320 --> 07:56.320
Yeah.

07:56.320 --> 07:57.320
Okay.

07:57.320 --> 07:59.240
Now I'm like, how did she make it out?

07:59.240 --> 08:01.240
Cause who has 22 foot arms?

08:01.240 --> 08:03.240
That's a good question.

08:03.240 --> 08:05.320
Was that like a claw game kind of thing?

08:05.320 --> 08:07.640
Cause I'm pretty good at that too.

08:07.640 --> 08:13.080
And thank you, Inspector Gadget for making time in your day to save baby Jessica.

08:13.080 --> 08:19.480
Inspector Gadget was, French Stewart is, okay.

08:19.480 --> 08:22.000
This is an advice show.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.800
A lot of people are going to say Broderick.

08:23.800 --> 08:24.800
This is an advice show.

08:24.800 --> 08:25.800
Yes, it is.

08:25.800 --> 08:29.260
And we take your questions and turn them alchemy like into wisdom.

08:29.260 --> 08:30.960
And now we're going to do that.

08:30.960 --> 08:31.960
Okay.

08:31.960 --> 08:32.960
I promise.

08:32.960 --> 08:34.360
You are fun.

08:34.360 --> 08:35.360
I miss this.

08:35.360 --> 08:36.360
Okay.

08:36.360 --> 08:37.360
I'm planning on.

08:37.360 --> 08:38.360
Are you talking about us?

08:38.360 --> 08:39.360
No.

08:39.360 --> 08:40.360
Demonstrably.

08:40.360 --> 08:41.360
No.

08:41.360 --> 08:47.120
I'm planning on going skydiving for the first time and I need.

08:47.120 --> 08:48.120
Don't.

08:48.120 --> 08:55.280
I need to know what are some topics of conversation I can talk to the skydiving instructor about

08:55.280 --> 09:03.160
while I'm strapped to them gently floating for five to seven minutes.

09:03.160 --> 09:06.920
That is from Caitlin.

09:06.920 --> 09:09.040
Caitlin, are you here?

09:09.040 --> 09:10.040
Hi.

09:10.040 --> 09:11.040
Hi.

09:11.040 --> 09:12.040
Oh, hi Caitlin.

09:12.040 --> 09:13.040
Okay.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.040
What I love.

09:14.040 --> 09:18.000
Sitting awfully low, Caitlin, not in the, not in the high up seats I see.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.520
The laughter and reaction I heard from most of the audience.

09:21.520 --> 09:26.280
I believe you shared a similar feeling I did when I first read the question where I thought

09:26.280 --> 09:29.040
that's not something I've ever thought about.

09:29.040 --> 09:33.720
And now it will be what I think about every time I think about tandem skydiving.

09:33.720 --> 09:34.720
Yeah.

09:34.720 --> 09:37.600
Because there is a certain point where it's like you get out of the plane, you're falling

09:37.600 --> 09:38.600
for a while.

09:38.600 --> 09:41.400
You're like, oh, whoa.

09:41.400 --> 09:42.400
There's not a-

09:42.400 --> 09:46.000
It's still, it's still, whoa, ground's still pretty far away, huh?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Do you-

09:47.000 --> 09:51.920
It's like a little soon, kind of creepy how soon you pulled it actually, freak.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.160
I actually want that.

09:53.160 --> 09:56.760
If I ever tandem skydive with someone, I don't want them being like, I got more time, I'll

09:56.760 --> 09:57.760
pull it later.

09:57.760 --> 10:01.200
Pull it now.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.240
I want it pulled as we're jumping out the door.

10:04.240 --> 10:05.240
Yeah.

10:05.240 --> 10:16.640
I, I think it's interesting that you have prioritized fears and it is one, jumping out

10:16.640 --> 10:24.280
of plane, much higher than that, what to talk to a person while jumping out of plane about.

10:24.280 --> 10:30.400
Well, to be fair, jumping out of plane is a, like, you're either in plane or not, right?

10:30.400 --> 10:33.840
But talking, that can fizzle out a couple of times-

10:33.840 --> 10:34.840
There's so many of them.

10:34.840 --> 10:39.960
Gravity only goes one ways, but conversational discomfort is a wide spectrum.

10:39.960 --> 10:44.520
Because oh my God, what you don't want to do is say something to upset the person.

10:44.520 --> 10:47.040
What if you say like, oh, you watch the football game?

10:47.040 --> 10:48.040
Yeah, let's hear it from Marshall.

10:48.040 --> 10:49.040
And they're like, I hate Marshall.

10:49.040 --> 10:52.040
And you're like, oh, please don't let me die.

10:52.040 --> 10:54.640
And they will kill you by dropping you to your death.

10:54.640 --> 10:58.000
Then they flip over so you're on the bottom and they land.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
I assume.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
I've never done that.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
You know what?

11:01.000 --> 11:04.120
I actually think that the onus is absolutely on the person that you're jumping out of the

11:04.120 --> 11:05.680
plane with.

11:05.680 --> 11:09.520
Because for you, you're jumping out of a fucking plane.

11:09.520 --> 11:12.400
For them, it's Tuesday, right?

11:12.400 --> 11:14.720
Like that let them come up with some small talk.

11:14.720 --> 11:17.960
You're losing your fucking mind thinking, why did I do this?

11:17.960 --> 11:18.960
I'm so squishy.

11:18.960 --> 11:19.960
This is ridiculous.

11:19.960 --> 11:21.960
I've got so many bones.

11:21.960 --> 11:26.400
Also, the chances are you've either passed out or peed yourself, which are both great

11:26.400 --> 11:30.420
conversation starters when you're strapped to another human being.

11:30.420 --> 11:31.460
How long was I out?

11:31.460 --> 11:34.800
And sorry, it's warmer.

11:34.800 --> 11:40.640
Do you think it's hard for the instructor to find a balance between like-

11:40.640 --> 11:43.540
You don't want to seem scared, because that's weird.

11:43.540 --> 11:47.160
But it's got to be every time, yeah?

11:47.160 --> 11:51.160
Every time your body's got to be like, oh, Doug, god damn it.

11:51.160 --> 11:52.160
Again?

11:52.160 --> 11:53.160
Fuck.

11:53.160 --> 11:54.160
Okay.

11:54.160 --> 11:55.160
Fine.

11:55.160 --> 11:56.160
But you also can't be so laid back.

11:56.160 --> 11:57.160
Right.

11:57.160 --> 11:58.640
Because the other person is having the experience of like, what are we doing?

11:58.640 --> 12:00.720
And if you're like, what did I have for dinner last night?

12:00.720 --> 12:01.720
Yeah, you can't-

12:01.720 --> 12:02.720
You're like, what?

12:02.720 --> 12:03.720
You got to be 100% dialed in.

12:03.720 --> 12:05.600
That's supposed to be a hard line to walk.

12:05.600 --> 12:10.080
I also think the question has to be, because when you're doing a tandem dive, I assume

12:10.080 --> 12:12.960
you're connected in a pretty per- like, not permit.

12:12.960 --> 12:13.960
At the butt.

12:13.960 --> 12:14.960
But like-

12:14.960 --> 12:15.960
What?

12:15.960 --> 12:16.960
At the butt.

12:16.960 --> 12:17.960
They connect you at the butt.

12:17.960 --> 12:18.960
Butt to butt?

12:18.960 --> 12:19.960
Butt to butt.

12:19.960 --> 12:23.240
And the parachute just comes out from between you.

12:23.240 --> 12:25.200
Yeah, butt to butt.

12:25.200 --> 12:31.340
But there has to be a moment when you land, and if you don't time the separation well,

12:31.340 --> 12:32.340
you land.

12:32.340 --> 12:33.340
Whoa, that's awesome.

12:33.340 --> 12:34.340
So.

12:34.340 --> 12:37.340
You're going to unclip us?

12:37.340 --> 12:39.520
Or am I supposed to unclip?

12:39.520 --> 12:40.520
Or-

12:40.520 --> 12:42.120
I'm un-clipping five feet off the ground.

12:42.120 --> 12:43.120
I'm un-clipping-

12:43.120 --> 12:45.480
Justin's doing a halo jump from-

12:45.480 --> 12:48.640
Wait, no, we're still- I'm just ready.

12:48.640 --> 12:50.040
How many of these do we really need?

12:50.040 --> 12:53.520
I have a second parachute in my pocket, and I'm base jumping off you.

12:53.520 --> 12:55.720
If we spoon on the ground, it's cheating.

12:55.720 --> 13:01.080
Also, because chances are, the person I'm strapped to has heard me say some things in

13:01.080 --> 13:02.080
this one.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.080
Right?

13:03.080 --> 13:05.200
I've done some pretty desperate prayers.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.640
I've cursed myself and them.

13:07.640 --> 13:09.760
Why would you let me do this?

13:09.760 --> 13:10.760
You're making us heavier!

13:10.760 --> 13:13.280
I have kids, you monster!

13:13.280 --> 13:15.120
Is definitely a thing that's coming out of my mouth.

13:15.120 --> 13:19.560
The idea that we'd land and high-five and go get a beer together is out of this world.

13:19.560 --> 13:22.760
They've heard me make some deathbed confessions.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.640
They might have to die, actually.

13:24.640 --> 13:30.840
Let's be real, Caitlin, you're worried about the wrong time period, because when you're

13:30.840 --> 13:33.500
falling through sky, anything goes.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.440
They're barely going to hear you.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.920
Well, after the flight, you will be in a van.

13:38.920 --> 13:41.880
You'll be in a van driving back to your car, and you're going to have to think of eight

13:41.880 --> 13:45.520
different ways to say, fuck the sky, right?

13:45.520 --> 13:46.520
Jesus.

13:46.520 --> 13:48.760
Do you remember when we were... Yes, I remember.

13:48.760 --> 13:50.040
As I've said, I was there.

13:50.040 --> 13:51.040
Do you remember, though?

13:51.040 --> 13:52.720
We fell out of a fucking plane.

13:52.720 --> 13:53.720
Yes.

13:53.720 --> 13:57.600
The chance that you will come up with an observation about the experience that this tandem diver

13:57.600 --> 14:02.600
has not heard before, that's the real... What am I going to say when I land?

14:02.600 --> 14:03.840
Oh, it smelled funny.

14:03.840 --> 14:04.840
That might be good.

14:04.840 --> 14:05.840
That could be offensive.

14:05.840 --> 14:06.840
That could go bad.

14:06.840 --> 14:10.080
It could also just be ozone.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.080
Hope that helps.

14:11.080 --> 14:18.600
While eating at Fazoli's, my girlfriend will scan our receipt to reap the loyalty points.

14:18.600 --> 14:19.600
She will then-

14:19.600 --> 14:20.600
They do loyalty points at Fazoli's?

14:20.600 --> 14:22.440
Yeah, they got to keep you coming back.

14:22.440 --> 14:29.320
She will then go from table to table asking strangers for their receipt.

14:29.320 --> 14:31.760
That wasn't enough of you reacting that way.

14:31.760 --> 14:35.440
They insist it's all right since their points would go wasted.

14:35.440 --> 14:39.160
I think it's rude to interrupt a stranger's meal.

14:39.160 --> 14:46.320
For reference, points are $1 equals one point and 75 get a free spaghetti.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.320
$75.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.280
No, wait, hold on.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.620
Are you thinking that's a lot?

14:51.620 --> 14:54.040
Because my thing is one point for $1 isn't enough.

14:54.040 --> 14:57.840
You got to jack that out 100 points for... And it's 7,500 points for spaghetti, whatever.

14:57.840 --> 14:58.840
Well, you invest at one and then the market-

14:58.840 --> 14:59.840
But one point-

14:59.840 --> 15:00.840
I know.

15:00.840 --> 15:02.560
That doesn't feel like a lot.

15:02.560 --> 15:05.680
She currently has 140.

15:05.680 --> 15:10.800
That's a lot of Fazoli's you've either consumed or stolen your fellow customers.

15:10.800 --> 15:11.800
I don't think-

15:11.800 --> 15:13.280
I'm going to use the word reapsed.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.280
Yeah, sure.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.280
You've reapsed that many points.

15:15.280 --> 15:16.280
Harvested.

15:16.280 --> 15:17.280
Yes.

15:17.280 --> 15:18.280
Recycled.

15:18.280 --> 15:19.840
Loyalty points are weird if you think about it.

15:19.840 --> 15:20.840
Yeah, wait.

15:20.840 --> 15:24.080
Yeah, go to the comedy microphone, Justin.

15:24.080 --> 15:27.480
Okay, yeah.

15:27.480 --> 15:33.680
Okay, so this is just how my mind works, but-

15:33.680 --> 15:34.680
Skewed view.

15:34.680 --> 15:35.680
Skewed view.

15:35.680 --> 15:38.400
Yeah, I want to give you my twisted skewed view.

15:38.400 --> 15:39.400
Thanks.

15:39.400 --> 15:40.400
Careful, folks.

15:40.400 --> 15:41.400
He works blue.

15:41.400 --> 15:42.400
Travis, you don't talk when he's doing it.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.400
Shut up.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.400
Okay, here I go.

15:44.400 --> 15:45.400
I was talking to him to shut up.

15:45.400 --> 15:46.400
You're heckling now.

15:46.400 --> 15:47.400
You're heckling.

15:47.400 --> 15:48.400
Okay.

15:48.400 --> 15:49.400
I'm going to check my phone.

15:49.400 --> 15:50.400
So I go to Subway.

15:50.400 --> 15:51.400
They gave me this card.

15:51.400 --> 15:55.480
If I get 10 subs, they'll give me a free one.

15:55.480 --> 16:03.920
But if I like the subs and I want to eat one and I'm giving you money for it, that should

16:03.920 --> 16:04.920
be enough.

16:04.920 --> 16:05.920
No, don't.

16:05.920 --> 16:07.920
That should be enough.

16:07.920 --> 16:08.920
Oh, no.

16:08.920 --> 16:10.960
This has become a dramatic one-man show.

16:10.960 --> 16:15.760
Because it should be enough that if I go to-

16:15.760 --> 16:16.760
He's crying.

16:16.760 --> 16:18.860
If I go to-

16:18.860 --> 16:20.000
If I go to-

16:20.000 --> 16:22.080
Listen how his accent is changing.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.080
He's trying to...

16:23.080 --> 16:24.080
No, listen.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.080
He's trying to supplicate himself before-

16:25.080 --> 16:28.880
I'm saying you should just want to go to Subway because you want to eat fresh.

16:28.880 --> 16:29.880
Yeah.

16:29.880 --> 16:33.760
And you shouldn't need to punch a card to feel good about it.

16:33.760 --> 16:34.760
Yeah.

16:34.760 --> 16:35.760
Yeah, man.

16:35.760 --> 16:38.600
For sure.

16:38.600 --> 16:42.560
Now sing Bring Him Home and the audition will be over.

16:42.560 --> 16:48.960
I will say that the discomfort that is introduced by having to say the sentence, may I have

16:48.960 --> 16:55.840
your Fizzoli's points, is as such that I would much rather go table to table and say, may

16:55.840 --> 17:04.440
I have $1 that I may then one day spend on fettuccine.

17:04.440 --> 17:09.560
I think that if it is uncomfortable, it is not because of the idea of click the points.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.320
You just got to work on your patter, right?

17:11.320 --> 17:14.720
Because if you go from like, hey, who here likes table magic?

17:14.720 --> 17:15.800
You guys like table magic?

17:15.800 --> 17:19.680
I'm going to make those points disappear.

17:19.680 --> 17:20.680
Right?

17:20.680 --> 17:21.680
Something like that.

17:21.680 --> 17:22.680
And they're like, I think this is part of it.

17:22.680 --> 17:27.160
I mean, I've never seen a table magician in Fizzoli's before, but they are wearing a cape

17:27.160 --> 17:28.160
and a vest.

17:28.160 --> 17:34.700
So I'm defending my PhD dissertation in oceanography at the end of next month.

17:34.700 --> 17:39.000
This live show is my early celebration.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.680
My school has a tradition where students sign their names in the rafters of one of the campus

17:43.680 --> 17:45.880
buildings when they successfully defend.

17:45.880 --> 17:50.120
I always thought I would think of something cool for this, but now it's a month out and

17:50.120 --> 17:51.640
I got nothing.

17:51.640 --> 17:56.600
As three famos who sign your names often, what's the coolest signature?

17:56.600 --> 18:06.040
I study, I shit you not, whale and dolphin sounds.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.880
If that helps.

18:07.880 --> 18:10.280
That's from soon to be PhD in SD.

18:10.280 --> 18:11.280
Are you here?

18:11.280 --> 18:13.720
Wait, how many of you are there?

18:13.720 --> 18:15.160
There's a lot of you defending your whale.

18:15.160 --> 18:20.360
Was that echolocation?

18:20.360 --> 18:25.600
When you say it's a school tradition, is it sanctioned or is it like, we did it, give

18:25.600 --> 18:26.600
the ladder.

18:26.600 --> 18:27.600
What?

18:27.600 --> 18:28.600
You kids?

18:28.600 --> 18:29.600
Ah.

18:29.600 --> 18:32.000
You did it again.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.520
If I may.

18:34.520 --> 18:35.520
You may.

18:35.520 --> 18:36.520
Okay.

18:36.520 --> 18:42.680
It feels a little presumptuous that you're like, what's the dope shit I can say when

18:42.680 --> 18:45.240
I definitely defend my dissertation?

18:45.240 --> 18:50.320
No, no, I'm not saying you're going to fail, but I am saying you're putting the cart a

18:50.320 --> 18:52.320
little before the horse.

18:52.320 --> 18:56.400
This is a time that you're never going to think about whales and dolphins again after

18:56.400 --> 18:57.400
you finish this.

18:57.400 --> 18:58.400
Right.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.400
Right.

18:59.400 --> 19:00.400
This is your last time having to think about it.

19:00.400 --> 19:04.000
Just power through and think about them for one more month and then you're out.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
You came to this show early.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
You're planning your ticket.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
We do appreciate you buying a ticket.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Thank you so much.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
But you shouldn't have come.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
You should have just bought the ticket.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Yeah.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.680
You came to the show to celebrate.

19:14.680 --> 19:17.640
Your signature is soon to be PhD.

19:17.640 --> 19:21.600
You're planning on what your signature is going to be.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.440
That's three pre-celebrations.

19:24.440 --> 19:28.320
You should drill down, think about dolphins and the sounds they make.

19:28.320 --> 19:29.320
For once.

19:29.320 --> 19:33.980
Because you don't know, you might be out at the beach and do whatever it is you do to

19:33.980 --> 19:36.680
summon the whales and dolphins to the shore.

19:36.680 --> 19:39.600
Don't get them too close though because then we have to all band together to push them

19:39.600 --> 19:40.600
back in.

19:40.600 --> 19:41.600
Yeah.

19:41.600 --> 19:42.600
And that's a lot of work.

19:42.600 --> 19:44.720
It's unpaid work.

19:44.720 --> 19:45.720
It's not great.

19:45.720 --> 19:49.640
And what if I accidentally push you hard and fall through the whale?

19:49.640 --> 19:50.640
Embarrassing.

19:50.640 --> 19:51.640
It's super embarrassing.

19:51.640 --> 19:54.760
Why aren't you super busy drawing off microphones?

19:54.760 --> 19:59.480
I would think that's like such a big part of your day.

19:59.480 --> 20:03.640
I'm just saying a whale might make a noise you've never heard before and you'd be like,

20:03.640 --> 20:05.280
start over.

20:05.280 --> 20:10.640
When you defend your PhD, is it like a bunch of people in fancy wigs saying like, that's

20:10.640 --> 20:13.400
not what a whale sounds like.

20:13.400 --> 20:14.800
I've heard a whale.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.760
I bought a CD once at Borders.

20:17.760 --> 20:20.120
And you're like, no, that is actually what whales sound like.

20:20.120 --> 20:21.120
I don't know.

20:21.120 --> 20:24.200
If you haven't practiced making whale sounds with your mouth, you should because that will

20:24.200 --> 20:27.720
definitely be part of the defense.

20:27.720 --> 20:29.720
Without looking.

20:29.720 --> 20:33.120
No, I'm hiding the sheet music.

20:33.120 --> 20:34.120
Just do it.

20:34.120 --> 20:40.520
I think it went something like, nope.

20:40.520 --> 20:47.800
Can you sign in a way where like the Y at the end of your name becomes like a whale?

20:47.800 --> 20:49.120
Oh, that's good.

20:49.120 --> 20:50.120
That's good, right?

20:50.120 --> 20:54.280
You might make one of those bumper sticker Jesus fish.

20:54.280 --> 20:55.760
Yeah.

20:55.760 --> 20:58.320
There's a high Icthus probability.

20:58.320 --> 21:02.000
Could you sign it in dolphin?

21:02.000 --> 21:08.440
Where it says like E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E.

21:08.440 --> 21:12.600
Listen, this is all insulting, but it's all we know about you.

21:12.600 --> 21:13.600
That's true.

21:13.600 --> 21:16.960
I'm sure you got a lot of other cool shit going on.

21:16.960 --> 21:19.200
You didn't include that in the question.

21:19.200 --> 21:23.400
The next best thing I have is like, I had a whale of a good time here at school.

21:23.400 --> 21:24.400
That's fucking funny.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.480
That's fucking funny though.

21:26.480 --> 21:30.600
If you do, if you're the first one to get there, it's yours.

21:30.600 --> 21:34.320
Future aliens will be like, Gribbler, get over here and check this out.

21:34.320 --> 21:35.320
This is fucking hysterical.

21:35.320 --> 21:42.360
It is important that you then do put a little note of like, I got my PhD in whale, for context

21:42.360 --> 21:45.200
aliens, I got my PhD in whale sounds.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.200
You get it.

21:46.200 --> 21:54.880
Last Christmas, I received a $25 gift card to Red Lobster, but no one will go with me.

21:54.880 --> 22:03.240
My friends and family laugh when I suggest going to the restaurant.

22:03.240 --> 22:08.160
Is it sad?

22:08.160 --> 22:09.600
Now read the question.

22:09.600 --> 22:10.920
That old thing?

22:10.920 --> 22:16.280
I dusted it out from my rejected by weird owl pile.

22:16.280 --> 22:18.720
I get it on that one, honestly, Albert.

22:18.720 --> 22:20.420
No, this is a question.

22:20.420 --> 22:26.480
Is it sad to go by myself and chow down on the four course seafood feast for $14.99?

22:26.480 --> 22:29.080
Can I take an unsuspecting date there?

22:29.080 --> 22:33.680
Is it bad to use a $25 Red Lobster gift card on a first date?

22:33.680 --> 22:40.640
I've never been to Red Lobster before and I love lobster.

22:40.640 --> 22:46.160
That's from Lobsterless in Los Angeles.

22:46.160 --> 22:53.440
I've never been to Outback Steakhouse, but I love Australian culture.

22:53.440 --> 22:57.400
I've never been to McDonald's, but I love Irish culture.

22:57.400 --> 23:00.440
When you say an unsuspecting date, how unsuspecting?

23:00.440 --> 23:02.800
Is that like, surprise?

23:02.800 --> 23:04.760
Take the blindfold off.

23:04.760 --> 23:06.600
The blindfold is actually a bib.

23:06.600 --> 23:07.840
We're at Red Lobster.

23:07.840 --> 23:12.400
I can tell you, the only thing I think would be sad about eating by yourself there is if

23:12.400 --> 23:15.640
you didn't use the whole gift card in one meal.

23:15.640 --> 23:16.640
Oh boy.

23:16.640 --> 23:21.840
If you said like, okay, so that's what, $14.99, that's $10.01 left.

23:21.840 --> 23:22.840
I'll be back tomorrow.

23:22.840 --> 23:28.120
Nah, it's no good, yeah, coconut shrimp, top it on there, $25 even.

23:28.120 --> 23:29.720
You gotta get it even though.

23:29.720 --> 23:30.720
Gotta get it even.

23:30.720 --> 23:35.400
Because if you go over and you're like, and here's a nickel, you've lost.

23:35.400 --> 23:37.160
Don't waste your time going there.

23:37.160 --> 23:38.160
Are you here?

23:38.160 --> 23:39.160
Yeah.

23:39.160 --> 23:40.160
Hi.

23:40.160 --> 23:42.080
You know you could be at Red Lobster, right?

23:42.080 --> 23:46.720
Right now, or any of the other fine Darden family brands, the gift card will work at

23:46.720 --> 23:47.720
any Darden restaurant.

23:47.720 --> 23:48.720
There's no way.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.480
Yeah, you could be used to the Olive Garden.

23:50.480 --> 23:51.480
That's too much power.

23:51.480 --> 23:52.480
No, no, no.

23:52.480 --> 23:53.480
Most of the Darden are interchangeable.

23:53.480 --> 23:56.760
You should read the fine print.

23:56.760 --> 23:59.720
So don't waste it.

23:59.720 --> 24:04.680
You gotta wait until the vortex opens up and it's Endless Shrimp Fest.

24:04.680 --> 24:05.680
Yep.

24:05.680 --> 24:10.280
Because Shrimp Fest, you are going to extend the value of this gift card in a way where

24:10.280 --> 24:12.720
you won't want other people there.

24:12.720 --> 24:13.720
Yeah.

24:13.720 --> 24:18.240
And if I may, Justin, you won't want other people to witness.

24:18.240 --> 24:19.240
This is what I'm saying, right?

24:19.240 --> 24:20.240
Yeah.

24:20.240 --> 24:22.400
Most of the time, you can't find a guest to join you.

24:22.400 --> 24:23.880
This time, you can't find a witness.

24:23.880 --> 24:24.880
Yeah.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.760
And you're not gonna want that.

24:26.760 --> 24:32.800
Because let me tell you from experience, it's more impressive to tell someone you ate 102

24:32.800 --> 24:34.440
shrimp after the fact.

24:34.440 --> 24:35.440
Right.

24:35.440 --> 24:42.320
But if you're keeping the count as it's going in front of another human person, it's not

24:42.320 --> 24:43.320
fun.

24:43.320 --> 24:46.080
It's a fun story, but a bad act.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.080
Yeah.

24:47.080 --> 24:48.080
Right.

24:48.080 --> 24:52.360
And there is definitely like culpability, if I can say that.

24:52.360 --> 24:55.760
If you watch someone eat 102 shrimp and you don't try to do something.

24:55.760 --> 24:58.840
And they're like writing it on the back of a napkin with a pencil so they can keep track

24:58.840 --> 24:59.840
to know exactly how many there are.

24:59.840 --> 25:03.200
This is getting deeply, deeply specific.

25:03.200 --> 25:07.920
Well, maybe you're there with your older brother and his like newborn daughter.

25:07.920 --> 25:11.040
And maybe it's the first time you've ever taken your newborn daughter to a restaurant

25:11.040 --> 25:14.280
and you want to make her proud with how much shrimp you can eat.

25:14.280 --> 25:19.480
And there's a certain amount of, what begins as unspoken competition and then becomes very

25:19.480 --> 25:24.320
much spoken competition to see how many shrimp your human body can consume.

25:24.320 --> 25:25.360
Don't waste time.

25:25.360 --> 25:28.920
By the way, sometimes they're gonna try to give you shrimp with like rice.

25:28.920 --> 25:29.920
Oh, no.

25:29.920 --> 25:31.400
That's a fucking sucker's bet.

25:31.400 --> 25:32.840
It's not Rice Fist.

25:32.840 --> 25:33.840
No.

25:33.840 --> 25:34.840
Pasta, rice, potatoes.

25:34.840 --> 25:35.840
Sucker's game.

25:35.840 --> 25:36.840
Yeah.

25:36.840 --> 25:37.840
Those are fillers.

25:37.840 --> 25:40.560
They're gonna be like, are you sure you wouldn't want some more Cheddar Bay Biscuits?

25:40.560 --> 25:41.560
Absolutely.

25:41.560 --> 25:42.560
No.

25:42.560 --> 25:43.560
I don't want more Cheddar Bay Biscuits.

25:43.560 --> 25:44.560
But you can put those in a to-go box.

25:44.560 --> 25:45.560
I'll take those home with me.

25:45.560 --> 25:46.560
Yeah.

25:46.560 --> 25:47.560
I'll take those with me.

25:47.560 --> 25:48.560
They don't reheat well, but they are free.

25:48.560 --> 25:49.560
Don't ask for...

25:49.560 --> 25:51.920
Do you guys remember that time you paid $40 to watch two adult men tell a great red lobster

25:51.920 --> 25:53.280
eating story that they did one time?

25:53.280 --> 25:54.280
I'm just saying.

25:54.280 --> 25:56.960
Don't cut the legs out from underneath me.

25:56.960 --> 26:01.520
If you ever go for Shrimp Fest, one last piece of advice, you're gonna want to alternate

26:01.520 --> 26:04.360
breaded, saucy, breaded, saucy.

26:04.360 --> 26:05.400
Don't do all saucy.

26:05.400 --> 26:06.400
Too much flavor.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.400
Don't do all breaded.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.400
Too filling.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.400
Breaded, saucy.

26:09.400 --> 26:12.460
Too much flavor is a common problem at Red Lobster.

26:12.460 --> 26:13.800
This is just too zesty.

26:13.800 --> 26:16.380
I can't handle it.

26:16.380 --> 26:18.600
And don't pace yourself.

26:18.600 --> 26:20.440
Regret it later, not in the moment.

26:20.440 --> 26:21.440
That's what I always say.

26:21.440 --> 26:25.080
Do you know that they make you pick your lobster out of a tank?

26:25.080 --> 26:26.080
You know that, right?

26:26.080 --> 26:29.960
They tell you its life story about all its children and friends.

26:29.960 --> 26:31.640
Red Lobster's a great restaurant.

26:31.640 --> 26:38.640
Hey, for your oceanology defense, you should just go burn down a Red Lobster.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.320
I defended the hell.

26:40.320 --> 26:43.120
This land is defended.

26:43.120 --> 26:45.480
Hey, guys.

26:45.480 --> 26:46.480
Yeah.

26:46.480 --> 26:47.480
Yeah.

26:47.480 --> 26:52.880
I think it's time to do some minion quotes.

26:52.880 --> 26:54.320
Okay.

26:54.320 --> 26:57.880
Now there is nothing.

26:57.880 --> 26:59.080
Here's what I want to say.

26:59.080 --> 27:03.520
There's nothing more delightful than this bit and when I am not the one doing it.

27:03.520 --> 27:04.640
What a treat that is.

27:04.640 --> 27:12.740
So before we get to the first one, finding minion quotes is a surprisingly difficult

27:12.740 --> 27:18.720
task because of trying to find the right search terms, right?

27:18.720 --> 27:23.160
And so what I tend to do is I find one and I'm like, this is great.

27:23.160 --> 27:26.320
And then I just go through like the related images search.

27:26.320 --> 27:30.720
And I hit my new favorite version of minion quotes.

27:30.720 --> 27:33.560
Can we see the first quote, please?

27:33.560 --> 27:34.560
Quote number one.

27:34.560 --> 27:37.560
Wait, can you explain how the bit works?

27:37.560 --> 27:40.680
Travis, can you explain the rules of the game?

27:40.680 --> 27:41.680
Yes.

27:41.680 --> 27:44.720
Justin and Griffin are going to try to guess the cartoon character represented here in

27:44.720 --> 27:47.100
this hilarious meme.

27:47.100 --> 27:49.960
And if they get it right, I will post it to my Facebook.

27:49.960 --> 27:50.960
It's Garfield.

27:50.960 --> 27:51.960
Hmm.

27:51.960 --> 27:55.160
Now, Justin, will you read this hilarious caption I found?

27:55.160 --> 27:56.460
Happy Tuesday.

27:56.460 --> 27:57.460
It's got to be Garfield.

27:57.460 --> 27:59.480
He made it through Monday.

27:59.480 --> 28:01.440
He's excited about Tuesday.

28:01.440 --> 28:05.440
It's got to be Garfield, Griffin.

28:05.440 --> 28:06.920
It's not fucking Garfield.

28:06.920 --> 28:09.560
It's too easy.

28:09.560 --> 28:15.280
The artists who create these, Justin, possess minds capable of a type of lateral thinking

28:15.280 --> 28:20.240
that you and I can only aspire to.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.240
I think...

28:21.240 --> 28:22.240
Odie.

28:22.240 --> 28:26.960
No, you can't change it.

28:26.960 --> 28:28.880
I'm going to say Bart Simpson.

28:28.880 --> 28:29.880
Okay, reveal.

28:29.880 --> 28:30.880
Shit.

28:30.880 --> 28:36.520
It's Yogi Bear, my dude, stoned out of his mind.

28:36.520 --> 28:37.520
Yogi Bear?

28:37.520 --> 28:43.520
With his, I'm just seeing now, far too large collar.

28:43.520 --> 28:44.520
Yeah.

28:44.520 --> 28:45.520
Okay, fine.

28:45.520 --> 28:46.520
Whatever.

28:46.520 --> 28:47.520
Next image.

28:47.520 --> 28:50.800
God, it makes me so mad when I fucking don't get them on this game.

28:50.800 --> 28:51.800
It should have been Garfield.

28:51.800 --> 28:52.800
Garfield.

28:52.800 --> 28:53.800
Reveal.

28:53.800 --> 29:04.640
Now, this one says, it's only Tuesday, exclamation point, question mark, exclamation point, question

29:04.640 --> 29:05.640
mark.

29:05.640 --> 29:06.640
Okay.

29:06.640 --> 29:08.920
And how has the cartoon character been removed here?

29:08.920 --> 29:11.480
Paul has done some Photoshop magic.

29:11.480 --> 29:12.480
Okay.

29:12.480 --> 29:17.560
I feel, and this may just be a color palette thing, like Fred Flintstone.

29:17.560 --> 29:18.560
Ooh.

29:18.560 --> 29:22.920
See, when Travis responds with anything other than fuck, I know it's not right.

29:22.920 --> 29:24.960
Now, I'm trying to keep my game face on.

29:24.960 --> 29:25.960
Taz.

29:25.960 --> 29:27.960
Like Adventure Zone?

29:27.960 --> 29:29.360
Tweety Bird.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.560
Okay, reveal.

29:31.560 --> 29:32.560
You were close, Justin.

29:32.560 --> 29:35.880
Oh, that's got to fucking sting, dude.

29:35.880 --> 29:37.680
It was Woodstock.

29:37.680 --> 29:40.980
Woodstock can't talk.

29:40.980 --> 29:42.040
It's Tweety Bird.

29:42.040 --> 29:43.640
That's a badly drawn Tweety Bird.

29:43.640 --> 29:44.640
That is not.

29:44.640 --> 29:45.640
That is not a badly drawn Tweety Bird.

29:45.640 --> 29:46.640
It's a bad Tweety Bird.

29:46.640 --> 29:47.640
How dare you say that about Charles Charles.

29:47.640 --> 29:52.680
Take the L. It's a bad Tweety Bird.

29:52.680 --> 29:53.680
Our third and final...

29:53.680 --> 29:59.960
Now, this one says, good morning.

29:59.960 --> 30:00.960
Happy Tuesday.

30:00.960 --> 30:01.960
Okay.

30:01.960 --> 30:05.160
I found so many about Tuesday.

30:05.160 --> 30:08.240
You guys are lucky I limited it to three.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.720
I had six.

30:09.720 --> 30:10.720
Fine.

30:10.720 --> 30:11.720
Fine.

30:11.720 --> 30:12.720
Fine.

30:12.720 --> 30:13.720
I'm going to...

30:13.720 --> 30:16.880
This is not my guess, but if I wanted to go down a pretty deep well, I would say, what

30:16.880 --> 30:22.680
if that's not an M, that the shape is obscuring, and it is in fact the Noid, and those are

30:22.680 --> 30:23.680
its fucking ears.

30:23.680 --> 30:31.040
Now, I will say, I had one that contained an M&M, and Paul told me that you guys would

30:31.040 --> 30:32.040
say that was cheating.

30:32.040 --> 30:35.440
So, I have not included any mascots in that way.

30:35.440 --> 30:36.440
Okay.

30:36.440 --> 30:37.440
Thank you.

30:37.440 --> 30:40.920
That was a gift you've given me, because now I know definitively...

30:40.920 --> 30:41.920
Now I don't.

30:41.920 --> 30:42.920
Fuck.

30:42.920 --> 30:43.920
Can we have a hint?

30:43.920 --> 30:44.920
Because it's no fun.

30:44.920 --> 30:45.920
No.

30:45.920 --> 30:47.240
It's no fun if we don't get any of them.

30:47.240 --> 30:50.120
Travis, you have to give us a hint, because we have to get at least one of them.

30:50.120 --> 30:51.120
Come on.

30:51.120 --> 30:54.360
The energy ending act one on a win is so much better.

30:54.360 --> 30:55.360
Okay.

30:55.360 --> 30:56.360
Okay.

30:56.360 --> 30:57.360
Okay.

30:57.360 --> 30:58.360
Okay.

30:58.360 --> 30:59.360
Okay.

30:59.360 --> 31:00.360
Okay.

31:00.360 --> 31:01.360
Okay.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.360
And not a bullshit hint.

31:02.360 --> 31:03.360
Just tell us the answer.

31:03.360 --> 31:05.520
Tell us the answer so we can embarrass you.

31:05.520 --> 31:08.200
There's so little context for these, Travis.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.200
Justin?

31:09.200 --> 31:10.200
Griffin?

31:10.200 --> 31:11.200
Yeah.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.200
Follow your heart.

31:12.200 --> 31:13.200
That's fucking...

31:13.200 --> 31:16.200
Garfield.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.200
Fuck.

31:17.200 --> 31:18.200
Yeah.

31:18.200 --> 31:23.200
It is so fucking hard.

31:23.200 --> 31:33.320
We'll be back in just a minute for some more comedy jokes.

31:33.320 --> 31:34.320
Send us your questions.

31:34.320 --> 31:35.320
We love you.

31:35.320 --> 31:36.320
We'll be right back.

31:36.320 --> 31:37.320
It's better.

31:37.320 --> 31:44.320
It's better with you.

31:44.320 --> 31:48.520
Griffin, I'm so stressed out.

31:48.520 --> 31:49.520
We had to cancel these shows.

31:49.520 --> 31:50.520
I'm freaking.

31:50.520 --> 31:52.760
I can't imagine why, bro.

31:52.760 --> 31:54.320
It's pretty chill out there.

31:54.320 --> 31:55.320
No, it sucks.

31:55.320 --> 31:56.960
I mean, it's like, I'm freaking out.

31:56.960 --> 32:00.480
We had to cancel these shows, and my brother has COVID, he'll be fine, but I'm like freaking

32:00.480 --> 32:01.480
out.

32:01.480 --> 32:02.480
Yeah.

32:02.480 --> 32:05.800
And it's so stressful, and I just wish I had a way to calm down.

32:05.800 --> 32:06.800
Yeah.

32:06.800 --> 32:14.480
I mean, that's fucking funny, because we have a sponsor this week, and the name of the business

32:14.480 --> 32:15.480
is Calm.

32:15.480 --> 32:20.840
I use Calm nearly every night to help myself fall asleep.

32:20.840 --> 32:23.560
They have meditations that you can do, which are great.

32:23.560 --> 32:31.440
They also have these sleep stories that are amazing, and they're intentionally dull.

32:31.440 --> 32:37.120
There's one, by the way, where Peppa Pig's dad tells you about concrete for a half hour.

32:37.120 --> 32:38.120
It is fantastic.

32:38.120 --> 32:39.120
Sign me up.

32:39.120 --> 32:40.120
Yeah.

32:40.120 --> 32:41.120
Fantastic.

32:41.120 --> 32:42.120
Absolutely fantastic.

32:42.120 --> 32:43.120
You can rest.

32:43.120 --> 32:44.120
You can recharge.

32:44.120 --> 32:45.120
They have stories for kids and adults.

32:45.120 --> 32:49.480
There's even daily movement sessions, which can help relax your body and uplift your mind.

32:49.480 --> 32:55.380
If you go to calm.com slash my brother, you'll get a special offer of 40% off of a Calm premium

32:55.380 --> 33:00.120
subscription, and new content is added every week.

33:00.120 --> 33:05.560
For listeners of the show, Calm is offering an exclusive offer of 40% off a Calm membership

33:05.560 --> 33:06.560
subscription.

33:06.560 --> 33:13.400

33:13.400 --> 33:18.640
my brother for 40% off unlimited access to Calm's entire library.

33:18.640 --> 33:21.640
That's calm.com slash my brother.

33:21.640 --> 33:27.000
I have recently moved to the District of Columbia and had to go get a new driver's license from

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
there.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.460
The day I walked in, handed over my paperwork confidently, they were like, time to take

33:31.460 --> 33:32.800
a photo.

33:32.800 --> 33:38.840
I was like, this is an important moment because it's going to be my representation in photological

33:38.840 --> 33:40.840
form forever.

33:40.840 --> 33:49.600
I looked down and I was just stitch fix H to T. I was like, I'm ready.

33:49.600 --> 33:52.520
I'm ready for my fashion to be captured.

33:52.520 --> 33:53.520
They took the picture.

33:53.520 --> 33:56.080
They're like, this looks so good, we're going to put it in the Library of Congress just

33:56.080 --> 33:57.080
down the street.

33:57.080 --> 33:59.440
Where'd you get those duds, man?

33:59.440 --> 34:00.440
I was like, stitch fix.

34:00.440 --> 34:01.440
How's it work, Griffin?

34:01.440 --> 34:09.520
Well, at the Library of Congress, oh, stitch fix, it's so stinking easy.

34:09.520 --> 34:15.640
You just go through this questionnaire and they ask you where you get your clothes from,

34:15.640 --> 34:21.040
what you like to wear, what your price range is, how big everything is, and then they will

34:21.040 --> 34:24.880
send you a box with some stuff handpicked just for you.

34:24.880 --> 34:25.880
Clothes, right?

34:25.880 --> 34:26.880
Clothes, yeah.

34:26.880 --> 34:33.040
Hey, we found a bunch of paper clips in our office, do you need these?

34:33.040 --> 34:34.240
Check it out.

34:34.240 --> 34:35.240
It's tastations.

34:35.240 --> 34:37.840
We just have these lying around.

34:37.840 --> 34:41.200
No, you try on the stuff, you check the fit.

34:41.200 --> 34:47.480
If you like it, you keep it, you buy it, and if something doesn't fit, you don't vibe with

34:47.480 --> 34:48.640
it, you send it right back for free.

34:48.640 --> 34:51.440
There's no problem at all.

34:51.440 --> 34:52.760
It is incredible.

34:52.760 --> 34:58.560
We've all been using Stitch Fix for forever, and I'm excited because I've got this, I've

34:58.560 --> 35:04.240
got a lot of sort of fall and winter wear from Stitch Fix that I didn't, it never really

35:04.240 --> 35:09.000
was in the rotation for very long in Texas, but now, oh, baby.

35:09.000 --> 35:13.040
It's sweater weather, and it's all Stitch Fix from here on out.

35:13.040 --> 35:18.040
Right now, Stitch Fix is offering our listeners $20 off their first fix at stitchfix.com slash

35:18.040 --> 35:23.500
my brother, that's stitchfix.com slash my brother for $20 off today, stitchfix.com slash

35:23.500 --> 35:24.800
my brother.

35:24.800 --> 35:27.920
Thank you so much for listening to our episode for this week.

35:27.920 --> 35:29.640
This is a lot of fun.

35:29.640 --> 35:35.960
I wish we, you all could have been there in one big room.

35:35.960 --> 35:37.720
I wish Travis could have been here.

35:37.720 --> 35:40.680
I wish Travis could have been here, and I wish you could have been there, but you can

35:40.680 --> 35:44.640
bring the magic home, which is something I want to start saying more.

35:44.640 --> 35:45.640
Oh, that's fine.

35:45.640 --> 35:50.840
The magic home with our merchandise, we've got some new stuff, a Garrel blanket designed

35:50.840 --> 35:54.580
by Lynn Doyle, at Lynn Doyle underscore on Instagram.

35:54.580 --> 35:59.040
We got Canonites wrapping paper designed by Justin Gray, who is at Burn to Build on Twitter.

35:59.040 --> 36:03.780
10% of all merch proceeds this month will go to the Fair Elections Center, which uses

36:03.780 --> 36:07.500
litigation and advocacy to remove barriers to registration voting, particularly those

36:07.500 --> 36:12.820
disenfranchising underrepresented and marginalized communities, and to improve election administration.

36:12.820 --> 36:16.620
If you want any of that, you can get it at McElroyMerch.com.

36:16.620 --> 36:23.840
We have some shows coming up in Washington, DC, Detroit, and Cincinnati for my Bim Bam

36:23.840 --> 36:27.760
and Taz, and also San Jose and Denver.

36:27.760 --> 36:33.640
We will be figuring out new dates for the shows that we had to reschedule, I guess last

36:33.640 --> 36:36.280
week when you hear this, very, very soon.

36:36.280 --> 36:41.620
All that info and tickets and everything are available at bit.ly slash McElroy Tours.

36:41.620 --> 36:45.420
Get all those shows, masks, and proof of full vaccination or negative COVID tests within

36:45.420 --> 36:48.340
72 hours of event start will be required.

36:48.340 --> 36:54.740
And hey, would you do us a huge favor and pre-order the Taz 11th Hour Graphic Novel?

36:54.740 --> 37:00.520
It comes out February 21st of next year, and pre-orders are very important.

37:00.520 --> 37:05.580
If you didn't know that already about books, I didn't until we started making them, and

37:05.580 --> 37:09.440
it's pretty important, and also the book is good, and I think you'll feel good reading

37:09.440 --> 37:10.440
it.

37:10.440 --> 37:13.940
Go to TheAdventureZoneComic.com right now to pre-order it.

37:13.940 --> 37:18.860
Check it out, have fun, and that's it.

37:18.860 --> 37:19.860
That's all of them.

37:19.860 --> 37:29.600
We'll be back with a new dead episode, I guess, next week, and prayers up for Trav, he's doing

37:29.600 --> 37:30.600
much better.

37:30.600 --> 37:32.620
But this freaking-

37:32.620 --> 37:33.620
I'm done, man.

37:33.620 --> 37:34.620
I'm over it.

37:34.620 --> 37:41.660
I'm done, because Joe told me and everyone we whipped this thing.

37:41.660 --> 37:43.380
Yeah, it's impossible that Trav has got it.

37:43.380 --> 37:44.380
What is his angle?

37:44.380 --> 37:45.380
It's weird that he got it.

37:45.380 --> 37:52.140
And Justin, let me tell you, I think he did it to try to embarrass the American president,

37:52.140 --> 37:53.140
Joe Biden.

37:53.140 --> 37:54.140
That's so rude.

37:54.140 --> 37:57.020
He'd be like, oh yeah, it's over, is it?

37:57.020 --> 37:58.780
And Joe's like, oh, damn it.

37:58.780 --> 38:04.500
Joe's like, it's not cool to have COVID anymore, and Trav's like, I'm sorry, sorry, Joe.

38:04.500 --> 38:07.020
Anyway, that's all the ads for this week.

38:07.020 --> 38:09.540
Let's get back to the show.

38:09.540 --> 38:12.360
Hello, dreamers.

38:12.360 --> 38:18.340
This is Evelyn Denton, CEO of the only world-class, fully immersive theme resort, Steeplechase.

38:18.340 --> 38:22.220
You know, I've been seeing more and more reports on the blogs that our beloved park simply

38:22.220 --> 38:23.540
isn't safe anymore.

38:23.540 --> 38:24.780
Murdered them?

38:24.780 --> 38:26.060
I'm gonna wreck it.

38:26.060 --> 38:29.900
They say they got mugged by brigands in the fantasy kingdom of Ephemera or hijacked by

38:29.900 --> 38:31.340
space pirates in Infinitum.

38:31.340 --> 38:32.940
I mean, I could have a knife.

38:32.940 --> 38:36.260
My papa said that I needed to do a crime.

38:36.260 --> 38:40.660
Friends, I'm here to reassure you that it's all part of the show.

38:40.660 --> 38:44.420
These criminals were really just overzealous staff trying to make things a little more

38:44.420 --> 38:46.420
magical for our guests.

38:46.420 --> 38:48.820
We're just as safe as we've always been.

38:48.820 --> 38:51.020
This isn't a county fair, dreamers.

38:51.020 --> 38:58.860
This is Steeplechase, the Adventure Zone, every Thursday at MaximumFun.org.

38:58.860 --> 39:03.580
Since the dawn of time, man has dreamed of bringing life back from the dead.

39:03.580 --> 39:08.340
From Orpheus and Eurydice to Frankenstein's monster, resurrection has long been merely

39:08.340 --> 39:12.140
the stuff of myth, fiction, and fairytale.

39:12.140 --> 39:13.140
Until now.

39:13.140 --> 39:16.500
Actually, we still can't bring people back from the dead.

39:16.500 --> 39:21.380
That would be crazy, but the Dead Pilot Society podcast has found a way to resurrect great

39:21.380 --> 39:24.980
dead comedy pilots from Hollywood's finest writers.

39:24.980 --> 39:28.880
Every month, Dead Pilot Society brings you a reading of a comedy pilot that was sold

39:28.880 --> 39:34.220
and developed but never produced, performed by the funniest actors from film and television.

39:34.220 --> 39:36.860
How does Dead Pilot Society achieve this miracle?

39:36.860 --> 39:44.500
The answer can only be found at MaximumFun.org.

39:44.500 --> 39:51.220
I realized moments before we came up here that I have spilled red wine on this rented

39:51.220 --> 40:00.980
tuxedo shirt, which I'm pretty sure is, like, the one thing they ask you not to do.

40:00.980 --> 40:03.100
This is also where I go to in this moment.

40:03.100 --> 40:06.980
There's no way you're the first person to spill red wine on a rented tuxedo.

40:06.980 --> 40:08.420
They're like, throw it in the vat.

40:08.420 --> 40:16.860
I may be the first person to charge that to his family business credit card.

40:16.860 --> 40:23.900
I recently got a job working at a train museum.

40:23.900 --> 40:27.900
When my next door neighbor found out about the job, he told me he had some items he thought

40:27.900 --> 40:29.980
the museum might be interested in.

40:29.980 --> 40:32.780
Not how that process works at all.

40:32.780 --> 40:37.380
I was skeptical, but I asked my boss if they'd be interested in receiving some items from

40:37.380 --> 40:38.380
him.

40:38.380 --> 40:42.920
She seemed kind of annoyed and said he could email them pictures, but the museum is too

40:42.920 --> 40:44.660
full of artifacts already.

40:44.660 --> 40:50.020
Okay, wait, real quick, that feels like there were some words edited out in the middle.

40:50.020 --> 40:52.140
They were pretty annoyed, but said yes.

40:52.140 --> 40:54.980
Yeah, wait, they're not looking to add anything.

40:54.980 --> 40:58.780
I told this to my neighbor, but despite this information, he made me take pictures of an

40:58.780 --> 41:07.760
old mug with a train on it and told me to show my boss.

41:07.760 --> 41:10.980
Now every time I see him, he asks me if I've shown her the pictures.

41:10.980 --> 41:14.940
Brothers, how do I get out of this awkward situation without annoying my boss, and that's

41:14.940 --> 41:18.020
from Train Lady.

41:18.020 --> 41:23.580
I also like that nowhere in there do they say how the boss responded after showing them

41:23.580 --> 41:26.180
the picture of the mug, but we can all assume.

41:26.180 --> 41:27.180
Yeah, we know.

41:27.180 --> 41:33.660
Like the rest of that story wasn't like, oh fuck, check out that mug, yeah.

41:33.660 --> 41:40.460
I want to quibble with something before we're helpful, and maybe this lets you off the hook.

41:40.460 --> 41:50.140
Um, I take umbrage with the train museum boss, who's like, what do they have?

41:50.140 --> 41:52.140
Old train shit?

41:52.140 --> 41:58.420
Like, do you have the dopest old train shit already, and you know it?

41:58.420 --> 42:00.900
The fact that you're closed off the possibility.

42:00.900 --> 42:08.980
Secondly, if people who run old train museums can't get excited about old train shit, what

42:08.980 --> 42:12.180
are we even doing?

42:12.180 --> 42:18.300
Like you should be the one person who's like, no, you don't get it, it's a mug with a train

42:18.300 --> 42:19.300
on it.

42:19.300 --> 42:21.140
It's amazing.

42:21.140 --> 42:24.980
What we've got, Justin, is a classic scenario.

42:24.980 --> 42:29.020
When they started the museum, oh god, they were so passionate about trains.

42:29.020 --> 42:32.980
They cared so much they had a fire burning inside, but now years have passed, and the

42:32.980 --> 42:38.380
world has crushed that fire out, and now you, the young gun Train Lady, have a chance to

42:38.380 --> 42:44.320
come in and reignite that fire with your passion for this busted ass mug.

42:44.320 --> 42:49.900
Did anybody else imagine it as a museum where everything's tiny like model train size?

42:49.900 --> 42:52.100
Okay, so that wasn't just me.

42:52.100 --> 42:53.980
That's not a museum though, right?

42:53.980 --> 42:56.860
You can't be a museum to that one thing a guy builds.

42:56.860 --> 43:01.340
If you don't- That's just Rod Stewart's attic.

43:01.340 --> 43:03.780
Rod Stewart's way into model trains, by the way.

43:03.780 --> 43:09.260
Hey, this is Comic-Con, they know that Rod Stewart's way into model trains.

43:09.260 --> 43:12.220
He's blown a lot of his money on model trains.

43:12.220 --> 43:17.900
It's just labyrinth quotes and Rod Stewart trivia with this crowd.

43:17.900 --> 43:22.220
Train magic, okay.

43:22.220 --> 43:29.860
I mean, I think you should say like we have it, we're putting it in a, you know in real

43:29.860 --> 43:32.540
museums they don't exhibit everything all the time.

43:32.540 --> 43:34.420
Sorry, real museums?

43:34.420 --> 43:35.420
Sorry.

43:35.420 --> 43:37.980
I didn't mean that.

43:37.980 --> 43:40.140
Okay, no, you know what?

43:40.140 --> 43:41.140
Fuck off.

43:41.140 --> 43:47.020
Real museums aren't like, real museums aren't like, paintings?

43:47.020 --> 43:48.020
Got enough.

43:48.020 --> 43:49.020
No, hold on.

43:49.020 --> 43:50.020
Hard pass.

43:50.020 --> 43:51.020
To be fair.

43:51.020 --> 43:52.020
Wait, that's a triceratops.

43:52.020 --> 43:53.020
What?

43:53.020 --> 43:54.020
No.

43:54.020 --> 43:55.020
Thank you.

43:55.020 --> 43:58.780
If everybody who worked at the Louvre came in and said, my neighbor has a painting, do

43:58.780 --> 43:59.780
you want it?

43:59.780 --> 44:04.580
The Louvre wouldn't be like, hell yeah, we do, the more the merrier.

44:04.580 --> 44:12.260
Well and more specifically, no one comes into the Louvre saying, my neighbor has some drinkware

44:12.260 --> 44:13.740
with a painting on.

44:13.740 --> 44:16.500
Oh, you guys like the Mona Lisa?

44:16.500 --> 44:20.700
Well, I have a blacklight poster of the Mona Lisa, do you want that too?

44:20.700 --> 44:21.700
You know the Mona Lisa?

44:21.700 --> 44:23.900
What if you could sip a Bev out of her head?

44:23.900 --> 44:30.220
Now I've got you interested.

44:30.220 --> 44:34.780
Yeah, I think just take it, leave it at the museum.

44:34.780 --> 44:37.300
Any time he comes by, put it out.

44:37.300 --> 44:40.600
Just like he was an in-law or something, it's fine.

44:40.600 --> 44:44.660
This is going in the private vintage.

44:44.660 --> 44:48.580
They actually, they would have displayed it, but it's too valuable.

44:48.580 --> 44:50.180
They can't afford the insurance.

44:50.180 --> 44:51.660
It's too erotic.

44:51.660 --> 44:56.740
This is going in our erotic section.

44:56.740 --> 44:57.740
You must be 21 years old.

44:57.740 --> 45:02.740
Through this beaded curtain.

45:02.740 --> 45:10.140
It's a haunted doll watch.

45:10.140 --> 45:14.780
When you listen to this recording later, you'll be like, wow, that was really smooth how they

45:14.780 --> 45:18.940
transitioned from one thing, because none of that will be in there.

45:18.940 --> 45:21.900
Let's meet Mary.

45:21.900 --> 45:25.340
Oh, oh, with a track by Ludacris.

45:25.340 --> 45:32.340
They got orb on this track?

45:32.340 --> 45:35.160
Paranormal to regular doll.

45:35.160 --> 45:36.160
Don't freak out.

45:36.160 --> 45:38.580
Paranormal metaphysical doll vessel.

45:38.580 --> 45:42.700
Touched orbs, free spirit reading, free gift.

45:42.700 --> 45:47.660
Touched orbs sounds like something that you say when you're in high school and are trying

45:47.660 --> 45:50.020
not to sound like you are a virgin.

45:50.020 --> 45:51.020
Yeah.

45:51.020 --> 45:52.020
Oh, me?

45:52.020 --> 45:54.380
I for sure touched the orbs.

45:54.380 --> 45:56.740
It applies to so much.

45:56.740 --> 46:02.500
I guess you could say thine orbs have been touched.

46:02.500 --> 46:07.180
And yeah, I got a free gift, wink.

46:07.180 --> 46:14.340
It got metaphysical, paranormal, metaphysical doll vessel, touched orbs, free spirit reading,

46:14.340 --> 46:15.340
free gift.

46:15.340 --> 46:17.260
Greatly powered, my friends.

46:17.260 --> 46:19.060
Her name is Mary.

46:19.060 --> 46:21.820
It's like she's carrying a Derringer.

46:21.820 --> 46:27.180
She is positively touched and charged.

46:27.180 --> 46:32.100
She will be out tonight for the supermoon charging.

46:32.100 --> 46:37.300
Did you know that if your haunted dolls are running a little low, you can take them out

46:37.300 --> 46:44.780
during a supermoon and charge them up full of that good spirit juice that they crave.

46:44.780 --> 46:50.540
Their personal card readings have been drawn during listing with Mary's help.

46:50.540 --> 46:52.180
Listen to that called shot.

46:52.180 --> 46:58.220
I did a reading for the person that will buy this with the help of my assistant, a doll.

46:58.220 --> 46:59.540
Who you are buying.

46:59.540 --> 47:00.540
Who you will buy.

47:00.540 --> 47:04.660
Wait, but during the listing, was it during every other word?

47:04.660 --> 47:06.460
When did they stop and do the...

47:06.460 --> 47:11.820
A special prayer and intention has been sent out for Mary's new owner.

47:11.820 --> 47:17.100
So that's like...

47:17.100 --> 47:21.260
She just hit select all on her phone and just uploaded everything.

47:21.260 --> 47:24.580
I mean, to be fair, that's a top notch cat.

47:24.580 --> 47:26.900
That's a great cat.

47:26.900 --> 47:29.180
Cat has buoyed the power of the show.

47:29.180 --> 47:35.820
I'm saying like a special prayer and intention has been sent for Mary's new owner.

47:35.820 --> 47:40.880
Mary, this is, listen, Mary comes, cause I will not repeat it unless you ask me to.

47:40.880 --> 47:43.100
Mary comes with a gorgeous bracelet.

47:43.100 --> 47:47.440
I do not see a stamp mark in it.

47:47.440 --> 47:50.660
I do not see a stamp mark in it.

47:50.660 --> 47:53.340
I do not see a stamp mark in it.

47:53.340 --> 47:55.160
Mary comes with a gorgeous bracelet.

47:55.160 --> 47:58.220
What is that image though?

47:58.220 --> 48:01.620
So it's basically the seller saying like, don't try to take this on the Antiques Road

48:01.620 --> 48:02.620
Show.

48:02.620 --> 48:04.440
There's no stamp mark in that bracelet.

48:04.440 --> 48:08.140
The bracelet gets lost and found often.

48:08.140 --> 48:09.140
That sounds fucking annoying.

48:09.140 --> 48:10.140
I don't want to buy that.

48:10.140 --> 48:11.260
Look at that.

48:11.260 --> 48:14.340
Mary attracts orbs and spirits.

48:14.340 --> 48:19.260
Take photos of her when you request communication to the lost.

48:19.260 --> 48:22.260
Fucking wow.

48:22.260 --> 48:26.340
Okay so they got out, went out for the supermoon charging.

48:26.340 --> 48:30.900
Person took a break from writing this listing to go out and do the charging and then return

48:30.900 --> 48:32.340
to the listing.

48:32.340 --> 48:34.460
Take another break to do a reading.

48:34.460 --> 48:35.460
Right.

48:35.460 --> 48:39.460
I revised listing to show orb manifestation during supermoon.

48:39.460 --> 48:40.460
Double.

48:40.460 --> 48:41.460
Yeah.

48:41.460 --> 48:42.460
Okay.

48:42.460 --> 48:43.460
Real quick.

48:43.460 --> 48:51.100
Paul, let's go ahead and enhance the orb, the orb manifestation that I'll remind you

48:51.100 --> 48:52.820
the cops can just look at.

48:52.820 --> 48:53.820
No problem.

48:53.820 --> 48:54.820
Orb manifest.

48:54.820 --> 48:55.820
No, no.

48:55.820 --> 49:00.820
Zoom in on the, okay.

49:00.820 --> 49:01.820
Yeah.

49:01.820 --> 49:05.940
They should have clicked the featured image that has the fucking orb in it.

49:05.940 --> 49:08.940
That's a Hyundai Sonata.

49:08.940 --> 49:10.940
Right there.

49:10.940 --> 49:13.200
That's not two orbs.

49:13.200 --> 49:18.740
That is a Ford Taurus.

49:18.740 --> 49:19.740
Nice try.

49:19.740 --> 49:26.740
A day ghost.

49:26.740 --> 49:30.240
Okay.

49:30.240 --> 49:31.320
Email with questions.

49:31.320 --> 49:32.320
Are you sure?

49:32.320 --> 49:37.420
Because I got a few paragraphs worth over on this end.

49:37.420 --> 49:42.020
Lucky numbers included free.

49:42.020 --> 49:44.540
Talking with her tonight sent Coco nuts.

49:44.540 --> 49:47.100
Oh, that's a cat?

49:47.100 --> 49:48.100
That's the cat.

49:48.100 --> 49:52.000
Look at that cat going wild.

49:52.000 --> 49:58.500
Do you take that to mean that she was talking to the doll and it made her cat wild or that

49:58.500 --> 50:02.940
her cat was talking to the doll and it just drove rape shit?

50:02.940 --> 50:07.380
Justin, if I could real quick, you pretend to talk to the doll and I'll be the cat.

50:07.380 --> 50:08.380
Okay.

50:08.380 --> 50:09.380
That's how I think it went.

50:09.380 --> 50:16.180
Would you like a treasure from the, oh.

50:16.180 --> 50:18.460
Talking with her tonight sent Coco nuts.

50:18.460 --> 50:25.740
So you can buy that, nope, maybe it's sold out, but you can.

50:25.740 --> 50:28.780
It went for no bids.

50:28.780 --> 50:29.780
No one bid on it.

50:29.780 --> 50:30.780
All right.

50:30.780 --> 50:31.780
I don't know why.

50:31.780 --> 50:34.340
It sent Coco nuts.

50:34.340 --> 50:41.780
We asked you our beloved audience members for your queries, if I may be so bold.

50:41.780 --> 50:42.780
Let's begin.

50:42.780 --> 50:43.780
Hello.

50:43.780 --> 50:44.780
Hello.

50:44.780 --> 50:45.780
I'm Annie.

50:45.780 --> 50:46.780
Hi, Annie.

50:46.780 --> 50:47.780
My pronouns are she, her.

50:47.780 --> 50:48.780
Hi, Annie.

50:48.780 --> 50:49.780
Thank you.

50:49.780 --> 50:53.940
My question was how do I avoid seeing naked people at work?

50:53.940 --> 50:54.940
Yeah.

50:54.940 --> 50:55.940
And you know what?

50:55.940 --> 50:56.940
Can I tell you, Annie?

50:56.940 --> 50:57.940
Yeah.

50:57.940 --> 51:00.060
I hope your job is like, I work at McDonald's.

51:00.060 --> 51:03.060
What context?

51:03.060 --> 51:05.180
So I work in retail.

51:05.180 --> 51:06.180
Yowzy.

51:06.180 --> 51:09.140
Oh, it's a fitting room thing, right?

51:09.140 --> 51:10.140
Yes, it is.

51:10.140 --> 51:11.140
Thank God.

51:11.140 --> 51:17.180
And I'm just, you know, doing my thing, helping her out, finding her sizes, and I come back

51:17.180 --> 51:24.460
with her item that she asked for, and the door swings open, you know, butt ass naked,

51:24.460 --> 51:26.300
all right?

51:26.300 --> 51:27.300
That's all you need to know.

51:27.300 --> 51:32.300
You said that in a way that was so butt ass naked to me.

51:32.300 --> 51:33.580
You get it, right?

51:33.580 --> 51:37.820
I was alarmed, to say the least, but I had to remain calm.

51:37.820 --> 51:40.420
We don't do that.

51:40.420 --> 51:41.420
I don't do that.

51:41.420 --> 51:42.420
No.

51:42.420 --> 51:43.420
Not there.

51:43.420 --> 51:47.980
In fact, sometimes when I'm trying to close on in a story, if I hear other people talking,

51:47.980 --> 51:50.060
it breaks the spell.

51:50.060 --> 51:53.860
I'm just reminded of like, oh no, I share this space with other human beings.

51:53.860 --> 51:54.860
I hate this.

51:54.860 --> 51:59.940
Well, and the bigger issue, Annie, is that underpants are the secret pants we wear underneath.

51:59.940 --> 52:02.140
Oh, that's an excellent point.

52:02.140 --> 52:03.140
Underpants.

52:03.140 --> 52:04.580
What kind of stuff do you sell?

52:04.580 --> 52:10.540
Underpants are the secret pants we wear underneath, so that that exact scenario doesn't happen.

52:10.540 --> 52:12.700
I know that I have at least that.

52:12.700 --> 52:17.580
If all else fails me, clothes wise, I know I have the secret pants that I wear under

52:17.580 --> 52:18.580
my big pants.

52:18.580 --> 52:19.580
Yes.

52:19.580 --> 52:25.300
If a big spill happens, a big hot spill, and burning is an issue, or a bug gets up there,

52:25.300 --> 52:26.940
I have options.

52:26.940 --> 52:29.220
I have smaller pants underneath my larger.

52:29.220 --> 52:38.020
That I keep underneath that are humiliating, but not illegal.

52:38.020 --> 52:40.340
Yeah.

52:40.340 --> 52:43.460
Humiliating for one, not both, which is what nudity is.

52:43.460 --> 52:45.020
Can we all agree?

52:45.020 --> 52:46.020
Anytime someone is-

52:46.020 --> 52:48.500
We should all be deeply ashamed of our bodies.

52:48.500 --> 52:51.140
Thank you, Travis.

52:51.140 --> 52:53.940
It's gross what's going on down there invariably.

52:53.940 --> 52:55.420
What even is that?

52:55.420 --> 52:56.420
No one knows.

52:56.420 --> 52:58.940
No one knows or understands it.

52:58.940 --> 52:59.940
Anything?

52:59.940 --> 53:01.780
No, it seems like you not.

53:01.780 --> 53:05.260
They open and they're like, check it out.

53:05.260 --> 53:09.660
Look at my emperor's new clothes.

53:09.660 --> 53:14.820
Was their behavior as such that you assumed that they assumed this was an everyday thing

53:14.820 --> 53:15.820
for you?

53:15.820 --> 53:16.820
Yeah.

53:16.820 --> 53:17.820
That you would become so-

53:17.820 --> 53:18.820
Immunized.

53:18.820 --> 53:19.820
Immunized.

53:19.820 --> 53:20.820
Okay.

53:20.820 --> 53:24.980
So inured to the nude form that you would just be like, oh, whatever.

53:24.980 --> 53:27.220
That's what you have going on?

53:27.220 --> 53:28.740
Seen it.

53:28.740 --> 53:30.660
Are they an older person?

53:30.660 --> 53:31.660
Yes.

53:31.660 --> 53:32.660
Okay.

53:32.660 --> 53:33.660
This is my gut.

53:33.660 --> 53:39.740
In the 40s, they didn't have Twitter, so they just got naked all the time.

53:39.740 --> 53:44.460
I do think that there is, as time passes, you're like, I don't have time for modesty.

53:44.460 --> 53:46.660
Is the feeling of like, oh no, that's bad actually.

53:46.660 --> 53:48.780
We should all have time for modesty.

53:48.780 --> 53:51.220
That should be, but I find myself feeling that way more and more.

53:51.220 --> 53:54.220
Hey, did they say ta-da?

53:54.220 --> 53:55.220
No.

53:55.220 --> 53:56.220
Thank God.

53:56.220 --> 53:57.220
Good.

53:57.220 --> 53:59.700
Good, good.

53:59.700 --> 54:01.460
That's a relief, honestly.

54:01.460 --> 54:02.460
Thank you.

54:02.460 --> 54:06.340
I think in that circumstance, you're fully justified to go, no.

54:06.340 --> 54:07.340
No.

54:07.340 --> 54:08.340
Please.

54:08.340 --> 54:09.340
You have to leave.

54:09.340 --> 54:10.820
This babies are us.

54:10.820 --> 54:16.100
I insist that you see your way out.

54:16.100 --> 54:18.020
You're trying on a starter jacket.

54:18.020 --> 54:19.020
What's wrong with you?

54:19.020 --> 54:20.020
What's wrong with you?

54:20.020 --> 54:22.700
You don't Winnie the Pooh a starter jacket.

54:22.700 --> 54:25.340
You wear pants.

54:25.340 --> 54:26.780
Does that help?

54:26.780 --> 54:27.780
Very much.

54:27.780 --> 54:28.780
Thank you.

54:28.780 --> 54:29.780
Oh good.

54:29.780 --> 54:30.780
What a relief.

54:30.780 --> 54:31.780
Hi.

54:31.780 --> 54:32.780
Hi.

54:32.780 --> 54:33.780
Hi.

54:33.780 --> 54:34.780
Hello.

54:34.780 --> 54:35.780
My name is Eric.

54:35.780 --> 54:36.780
I go any pronouns.

54:36.780 --> 54:37.780
It's a great dress.

54:37.780 --> 54:38.780
Thank you very much.

54:38.780 --> 54:39.780
It was $7 at a thrift store.

54:39.780 --> 54:40.780
Damn.

54:40.780 --> 54:41.780
Wow.

54:41.780 --> 54:42.780
Wait, hold on.

54:42.780 --> 54:43.780
Are you from the Midwest?

54:43.780 --> 54:44.780
Because that's a Midwest reaction.

54:44.780 --> 54:45.780
This, $5.

54:45.780 --> 54:55.940
I got to say, Eric, it's a come up in the words of my friend Macklemore, our relative

54:55.940 --> 54:56.940
Macklemore.

54:56.940 --> 54:57.940
Yeah.

54:57.940 --> 54:58.940
Why didn't he change his name?

54:58.940 --> 54:59.940
Why didn't he change his name?

54:59.940 --> 55:00.940
Eric, what's up?

55:00.940 --> 55:01.940
How can we help?

55:01.940 --> 55:02.940
What's your question?

55:02.940 --> 55:06.940
So, I got into D&D from the Adventure Zone a few years ago.

55:06.940 --> 55:07.940
Nerd.

55:07.940 --> 55:08.940
Yesterday.

55:08.940 --> 55:09.940
Yeah.

55:09.940 --> 55:10.940
Get him.

55:10.940 --> 55:11.940
Oh, okay.

55:11.940 --> 55:12.940
Wait real quick.

55:12.940 --> 55:13.940
D&D stands for Dungeons.

55:13.940 --> 55:14.940
All right.

55:14.940 --> 55:15.940
All right.

55:15.940 --> 55:16.940
All right.

55:16.940 --> 55:17.940
Sorry.

55:17.940 --> 55:19.500
Actually, it's Dungeons, not Dragons.

55:19.500 --> 55:20.500
Okay.

55:20.500 --> 55:21.500
Go ahead.

55:21.500 --> 55:24.620
And I made a bunch of dork ass friends.

55:24.620 --> 55:30.940
And being the only handy person I know, they went, hey, can you make us some swords?

55:30.940 --> 55:31.940
Okay.

55:31.940 --> 55:33.900
And you responded, yes.

55:33.900 --> 55:34.900
Of course.

55:34.900 --> 55:35.900
Sure.

55:35.900 --> 55:36.900
Of course.

55:36.900 --> 55:41.560
What was your skill set before this moment?

55:41.560 --> 55:42.560
Making one sword.

55:42.560 --> 55:43.560
Okay.

55:43.560 --> 55:44.560
Yeah, I assumed, Eric.

55:44.560 --> 55:45.560
Okay.

55:45.560 --> 55:49.220
I have run into this exact problem.

55:49.220 --> 55:53.100
I do things with wood one time, and I've done that now.

55:53.100 --> 55:54.780
I don't ever want to do it again.

55:54.780 --> 55:55.780
And then people say, can I have wood?

55:55.780 --> 55:56.780
I don't think so.

55:56.780 --> 55:57.780
I already did it.

55:57.780 --> 56:00.700
So, I'll do something else, thanks.

56:00.700 --> 56:02.180
What is your question?

56:02.180 --> 56:09.980
Now, I don't want them to stop, but I do need to know what to tell my mom, because I'm home

56:09.980 --> 56:11.740
from the summer from school.

56:11.740 --> 56:14.940
I'm out there with an angle grinder, going ham.

56:14.940 --> 56:15.940
Yeah.

56:15.940 --> 56:16.940
What do I say to her?

56:16.940 --> 56:17.940
Put on some goggles.

56:17.940 --> 56:18.940
It's way too loud.

56:18.940 --> 56:23.940
Trav, that was way too loud.

56:23.940 --> 56:27.060
That was unamplified for me.

56:27.060 --> 56:28.060
Hey, mom.

56:28.060 --> 56:29.060
I'll try it.

56:29.060 --> 56:30.060
Let me try it like this.

56:30.060 --> 56:31.060
No, no, no.

56:31.060 --> 56:32.060
Back off, mom.

56:32.060 --> 56:33.060
Put on some goggles.

56:33.060 --> 56:34.060
I'm working.

56:34.060 --> 56:35.060
And now some ASMR.

56:35.060 --> 56:44.060
Can you make your mom like a custom blade?

56:44.060 --> 56:55.420
Are your friends paying for these swords?

56:55.420 --> 56:56.420
One, yes.

56:56.420 --> 56:57.420
Two, no.

56:57.420 --> 56:58.420
Oh, hey.

56:58.420 --> 56:59.420
Guess what?

56:59.420 --> 57:00.420
You only have to make one sword.

57:00.420 --> 57:01.420
Yeah.

57:01.420 --> 57:02.420
Yeah.

57:02.420 --> 57:07.540
And also, it's a part-time job.

57:07.540 --> 57:08.540
Moms love part-time jobs.

57:08.540 --> 57:09.540
They're wild about it.

57:09.540 --> 57:10.540
Yeah.

57:10.540 --> 57:13.700
If you can say to your mom, I'm making money off of this, slam dunk.

57:13.700 --> 57:18.580
But when you say, they asked, and so I just started, everyone in your life should tell

57:18.580 --> 57:20.580
you not to do that.

57:20.580 --> 57:22.700
Hey, I've done blacksmithing.

57:22.700 --> 57:24.220
It's really hard.

57:24.220 --> 57:27.620
Don't make swords for free.

57:27.620 --> 57:29.420
It's a romantic gesture, one of them.

57:29.420 --> 57:30.420
It's...

57:30.420 --> 57:31.420
Okay.

57:31.420 --> 57:32.420
All right.

57:32.420 --> 57:33.420
All right.

57:33.420 --> 57:37.140
Wait, and now we didn't know romance was involved.

57:37.140 --> 57:41.820
You can give them a discount.

57:41.820 --> 57:43.860
A 69% discount.

57:43.860 --> 57:44.860
Yeah.

57:44.860 --> 57:47.260
They're going to lose it.

57:47.260 --> 57:51.260
They're going to lose it.

57:51.260 --> 57:52.260
What?

57:52.260 --> 57:53.260
Oh, okay.

57:53.260 --> 57:54.260
You wanted to...

57:54.260 --> 57:56.380
Justin, he said the...

57:56.380 --> 57:57.380
He said the...

57:57.380 --> 57:58.380
Did you hear?

57:58.380 --> 58:00.300
Oh, the sex thumb.

58:00.300 --> 58:04.020
This hand is injured, so I only have the one option.

58:04.020 --> 58:09.140
I hurt myself carrying bags because I'm old.

58:09.140 --> 58:13.260
And I've also reached an age when I say that and people go, no, it's not a joke, and they

58:13.260 --> 58:16.260
don't laugh, and it makes me sad.

58:16.260 --> 58:17.260
Does that...

58:17.260 --> 58:22.660
I mean, I know the answer, but does that help what we've said?

58:22.660 --> 58:25.260
I think enough because she's right up there.

58:25.260 --> 58:26.260
Okay.

58:26.260 --> 58:27.260
Hey.

58:27.260 --> 58:28.260
All right.

58:28.260 --> 58:29.260
Back off, mom.

58:29.260 --> 58:30.260
So cool.

58:30.260 --> 58:31.260
You brought your mom?

58:31.260 --> 58:43.540
We don't spend enough time telling mom what's up on this show.

58:43.540 --> 58:46.540
Hey, how's it going?

58:46.540 --> 58:47.540
Can I say something?

58:47.540 --> 58:50.980
It's been a while since we've done live shows or still working on The Dancer.

58:50.980 --> 58:53.340
I never do this, but that's a great shirt.

58:53.340 --> 58:54.340
Thank you.

58:54.340 --> 58:55.340
Yeah, I'd wear that.

58:55.340 --> 58:56.340
That's a real Justin shirt.

58:56.340 --> 58:57.340
You don't wear that.

58:57.340 --> 58:58.340
Give it to us.

58:58.340 --> 58:59.340
No, no, no.

58:59.340 --> 59:00.340
Don't.

59:00.340 --> 59:01.340
I can't.

59:01.340 --> 59:06.540
As we've said, everyone needs to hide their bodies, okay?

59:06.540 --> 59:09.140
But if you had another shirt under there that looked exactly like my shirt...

59:09.140 --> 59:10.140
Travis, let the person talk.

59:10.140 --> 59:11.140
Okay.

59:11.140 --> 59:12.140
Hello, who are you?

59:12.140 --> 59:13.140
My name is Dom.

59:13.140 --> 59:14.140
Hi, Dom.

59:14.140 --> 59:15.140
Hi, Dom.

59:15.140 --> 59:16.140
Hi.

59:16.140 --> 59:17.580
So I have a squatty potty.

59:17.580 --> 59:18.580
Nice.

59:18.580 --> 59:19.580
Brag.

59:19.580 --> 59:21.220
Yeah, great.

59:21.220 --> 59:24.900
Really choice, made out of wood, just beautiful, sits under my...

59:24.900 --> 59:32.460
Everyone in the audience just had the same incredibly specific reaction of like, what?

59:32.460 --> 59:33.940
It's the thing you put your feet up on.

59:33.940 --> 59:34.940
Oh yeah, we know.

59:34.940 --> 59:35.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:35.940 --> 59:36.940
We stand the squatty potty here.

59:36.940 --> 59:37.940
It's great.

59:37.940 --> 59:38.940
My brother, my brother and me.

59:38.940 --> 59:39.940
It's great.

59:39.940 --> 59:40.940
If you don't know, it's a...

59:40.940 --> 59:42.940
You've been pooping wrong.

59:42.940 --> 59:43.940
Your entire life.

59:43.940 --> 59:47.340
I'm sorry to break the news to you, but the squatty potty makes you poop right.

59:47.340 --> 59:54.740
What's great is I think that the Venn diagram of people with kids and older people who care

59:54.740 --> 59:56.940
about squatty bodies is a perfect circle.

59:56.940 --> 59:57.940
Yeah, for sure.

59:57.940 --> 01:00:00.820
Like, whatever's going to make things go faster down there.

01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:01.820
Yeah, great.

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:02.820
Love it.

01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:03.820
So I can get right back to parenting.

01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:04.820
Yeah, if you don't...

01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:08.220
So if you don't know, it pushes your legs, your knees up in the air.

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:10.740
So your butthole doesn't look so stupid.

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:11.740
Thank you.

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:12.740
Thank you.

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:14.700
So you can blow it right the fuck out.

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:18.220
It also improves your aim for whales.

01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:19.220
Okay.

01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:24.700
So anyway, I did not know squatty potty was doing tasteful wood numbers.

01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:28.140
I assume this is something you assembled.

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:30.260
Now looking at that, that's an IKEA squatty.

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:31.340
That's like a squinty pootty.

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:32.340
Where did you...

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:33.340
A squinty pootty.

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:38.860
It's a squinty pootty.

01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:43.060
Four hours to assemble it and then blah, blah, blah.

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:44.660
You know, IKEA humor.

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:45.660
Okay.

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:51.380
Hey, have you guys ever dissociated while doing a live show?

01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:52.380
Okay.

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:55.100
So what is your question about the squatty potty?

01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:57.620
Well, it's nice enough to show off.

01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:58.620
Yeah.

01:00:58.620 --> 01:00:59.620
Oh, obviously.

01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:01.100
I don't know if I want to.

01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:02.100
Okay.

01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:03.100
With COVID and everything.

01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.100
Yeah.

01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:05.100
Doing what it's doing.

01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:06.100
Wait.

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:07.100
Okay.

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:10.580
There are definitely parts of your body that I'm afraid of COVID on, bottom of your feet.

01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:11.580
Not one of them.

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:12.580
Fair enough.

01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:13.580
I...

01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:14.580
Hmm.

01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:17.020
I guess I'd rather should I hide it or not.

01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:18.020
No!

01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:20.660
Who's the whore at that point?

01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:21.660
I guess you.

01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:24.740
That was a stupid thing to say, huh?

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:25.740
I think it's...

01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:30.140
You're also talking to three men with bidets in their house, by the way, which is always

01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:36.140
great when a guest comes over and you're like, try it, and they're like, not now.

01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:40.420
There is no way to start to explain to someone that you have a bidet in your house and not

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:42.900
end it with, forget I said anything.

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:43.900
Yeah.

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:49.380
Having someone that you have a bidet is a 100% guaranteed way to make sure they will

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:51.220
not use the bathroom at your house.

01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:52.220
Yeah.

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:53.220
There's no way.

01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:58.020
Because the two options are, one, they go in the bidet room and you give them a, have

01:01:58.020 --> 01:01:59.940
fun, enjoy.

01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:01.740
Or the afterwards, like, did you?

01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:03.700
Well, how did I go?

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:07.340
Or that they don't know what the fuck they're doing in there and they make a big, bad bidet.

01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:08.340
And they blast off.

01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:09.340
Yeah.

01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:12.820
Why do they keep putting blast off buttons on bidets?

01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:15.260
And label them.

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:18.460
It's hilarious, but I fixed the roof three times.

01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:21.740
I'm done.

01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:26.420
I think that if you show someone that you have a squatting potty, I think it introduces

01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:29.980
to them this idea that they've pooped around their whole life and I don't think that's

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:30.980
very nice.

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:34.700
I think it's kind of like you just lost the game, right?

01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:40.500
Like, I don't think you should introduce, oh, sorry about that to everybody.

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.500
I don't think you should introduce this.

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:43.500
You were.

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:44.500
Okay.

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:50.180
Were you happier before you found out in your beautiful ignorance that you pooped wrong

01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:51.180
your whole life?

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:53.380
Listen, it took longer, but you were happy.

01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:57.340
Anytime you go to a Buc-ee's or a Wawa, do you need to use the bathroom?

01:02:57.340 --> 01:03:01.300
And it's just like this, I know I'm doing this wrong.

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:02.300
Is it this hard for everyone?

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:03.300
Why isn't the floor six inches higher?

01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:04.300
Hey, this sucks, right?

01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:09.300
Hey, give me two of those cases of Pepsi in here.

01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:20.060
No reason, I'm going to fashion my own DIY.

01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:22.620
Were you happier before you knew?

01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:24.020
It's been pretty great since.

01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:25.020
Yeah.

01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:28.860
That's hard to answer because we all used to be happier.

01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:29.860
Wait great since?

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:32.380
Are you telling me it fixes that too?

01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:35.900
No, we all learned about this the same way.

01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:40.700
We were just doom-scrolling on Facebook and saw the ad come up with the 3D diagram of

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:45.900
our stupid idiot all squinched up colon.

01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:47.900
And the unicorn pooping, that was it, right?

01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:49.280
Yeah, and that's it.

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:52.980
They were good commercials because pretty much they were instantly like, as you're

01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:57.740
scrolling through, it's just like, patriotic naughty, baby I don't care about.

01:03:57.740 --> 01:03:58.740
You're pooping wrong!

01:03:58.740 --> 01:03:59.740
Whoa, hold on.

01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:00.740
Back up.

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:04.740
Because on some level, I always knew.

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:05.740
I did.

01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:10.180
This can't be right, this can't be how I was intended, this can't be the best version

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:11.180
of this.

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:17.360
Can I, I'm going to do a little fun little, see if I can soothsay this a little bit.

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:24.180
I am guessing, based on the fact that you bought a wooden squatty potty, that you owned

01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:28.660
earlier a crude plastic squatty potty, yes?

01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:32.020
It was more of like a trash can or anything I could find.

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:34.300
Wait, wait, hey, wait.

01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:38.300
That, you know that's not the same, yeah?

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:42.100
And when you say it was like a trash can, it was a trash can, right?

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:43.980
Yeah, it was a nice gold trash can.

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:50.980
So you could also do bongos.

01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:54.980
I think that you now must tell everyone you have a squatty potty.

01:04:54.980 --> 01:05:01.020
I've decided it's no longer advice, it's a sentence.

01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:04.900
You must tell everyone, and then you say, and then you look at them dead in the eyes

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:08.460
and say, don't laugh, I used to use a trash can.

01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:12.100
Well, it was like a trash can.

01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:21.340
It was my off, off, off, off, off, off, off, off, off, off Broadway production of Bring

01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:24.140
Into Noise, Bring Into Funk.

01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:25.340
I brought in a lot of funk.

01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:28.380
The funk outweighed the noise.

01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:29.620
Does that help you?

01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:30.620
Absolutely.

01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:31.620
Thank you.

01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:32.620
Thank you.

01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:33.620
What a relief.

01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:34.620
Hello.

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:35.620
Hello.

01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:36.620
Who are you?

01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:37.620
My name is Mary Beth.

01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:38.620
Hi, Mary Beth.

01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:39.620
My pronouns are she, they.

01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:40.620
Thank you.

01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:52.300
And my question is, how many copies of Space Jam, the first one?

01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:54.900
Thank you for clarifying.

01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:56.740
It's 100% incredibly meaningful.

01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:57.740
Go ahead.

01:05:57.740 --> 01:06:00.300
Should, is it okay to own?

01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:02.180
We have six.

01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:03.180
You have six.

01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:05.660
We have five DVDs and one Blu-ray.

01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:07.540
My husband wanted to make the distinction.

01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:08.540
Okay.

01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:09.540
Thank you.

01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:12.620
Certainly that changes the English on this.

01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:19.300
And so Mary Beth, just contextually, when you say we have six, is that the right?

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:21.300
Your husband has six, right?

01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:22.300
Yeah.

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:23.300
Okay, fine.

01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:26.020
Unless you have one and he has five, okay.

01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:27.020
They are all his.

01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:28.020
Okay.

01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:29.020
Okay.

01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:32.620
You made a statement about this backstage and I want you to repeat it, because I have

01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:35.620
feelings and I've saved them.

01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:36.620
Okay.

01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:43.780
The number of copies of Space Jam that is too many to own is two copies of Space Jam.

01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:47.580
Because, and here's the only reason why I feel like that.

01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:48.580
Wait, wait, wait.

01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:50.100
Just a, sorry.

01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:52.100
Physical copies?

01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:57.340
No, I would count digital among us.

01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:05.420
The one copy of Space Jam is going to have all of Space Jam on it.

01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:08.380
No, no, no, no.

01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:09.380
Let me tell you why.

01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:11.420
Let me tell you why you're wrong and I love you so much.

01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:14.060
No, hold on, wait.

01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:16.620
There's no way I'm wrong.

01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:22.380
They really do put all of Space Jam right on the one DVD.

01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:23.380
Okay.

01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:26.220
You've never heard the term special edition?

01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:30.700
You already own Space Jam.

01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:31.700
What's that?

01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:32.700
A new version comes out.

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:36.100
Not only that, you need a legacy version to give to your kids and your grandkids.

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:39.380
There's one you watch and there's one you protect.

01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:43.900
I am 35 years old.

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:49.460
DVDs were invented well after I was born.

01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:55.740
I do not own any more DVDs, nor do I know where to acquire a DVD player on which to

01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:56.740
play them.

01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:58.580
Putting a lot of faith in the cloud, Griffin.

01:07:58.580 --> 01:08:01.620
Yeah, it's a lot of cloud faith.

01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:05.660
A thing that is often associated with the word dissipate.

01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:06.660
Wow.

01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:07.660
Think about it.

01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:08.660
Sheep.

01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:23.460
You've got to have one for the car because your kids are like, Space Jam, Space Jam.

01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:30.340
We took a tour bus on our last tour, or two tours ago, and they had a copy of Space Jam

01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:31.340
in there.

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:35.620
I doubt that's their home copy or their personal car copy.

01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:39.220
You need a Space Jam for car, Space Jam for home, Space Jam for business.

01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:41.260
Yes, thank you, Travis.

01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:42.700
A business Space Jam.

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:46.420
Oh, this is my professional Space Jam.

01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:49.100
You got to save one copy just in case.

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:50.100
Yeah.

01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:51.100
For special occasion.

01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:55.380
No, no, no, just like you need one behind glass, right?

01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:56.740
In the deposit box of the bank.

01:08:56.740 --> 01:09:00.500
I love that you guys were like, you put a lot of faith in the cloud, and then you're

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:06.620
like, here's all of our Space Jam Horcruxes that we fucking embedded throughout the fabric

01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:07.620
of time and space.

01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:10.100
No, I'm sorry, but Mary Beth even made the point.

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:19.260
Blu-ray, DVD, VHS, LaserDisc, vinyl, MiniDisc, they change these movies.

01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:22.780
This is a thumb drive that I've just written Space Jam on.

01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:27.420
Space Jam used to be on it, but now it's season three of Great British Bake Off.

01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:31.580
You all remember, you're old enough to remember what they did in the Star Wars, right?

01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:36.960
What if they do that to Space Jam and you can't get the good one anymore, but you do

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:41.620
need to own a copy of it just to... Oh, okay, so-

01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:42.620
Don't.

01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:43.620
Don't.

01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:44.620
Don't.

01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:52.860
I think, okay, so I've proven four mathematically, home, car, business, just in cases.

01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:56.700
And then a streaming one, that's five.

01:09:56.700 --> 01:10:00.180
One of the physical ones came with a digital version where you enter the code, so that's

01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:01.180
five.

01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:03.860
Yeah, but you're not going to get that across all your devices.

01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:10.220
I bet y'all, I'm not even on the Wi-Fi, I bet you in 60 seconds I could be watching

01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:11.220
Space Jam.

01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:12.220
Okay.

01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:13.220
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:16.100
We have a timer right in front of us.

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:17.100
I'm going to hit it though.

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:18.100
All right.

01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:19.100
Okay.

01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:20.100
At 410, I'm going to start it.

01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:21.100
Yeah.

01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:22.100
Ready?

01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:23.100
On your mark, get set, go.

01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:24.100
All right.

01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:25.100
Wrap up.

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:26.100
Does that help?

01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:27.100
Hey, does that help?

01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:28.100
Yes, thank you very much.

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:29.100
Okay, thank you so much.

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:30.100
Okay, I have 60 seconds.

01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:36.020
Thank you to Tyler Reed for our posters, thank you to Paul Sabourin, thank you to Rachel

01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:41.700
Jacobs over there recording us, thank you to Amanda and Nate and Shannon, one of our

01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:45.500
amazing staff members who's here, Shannon Griffin, still trying to watch Space Jam.

01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:46.860
We're at 25 seconds.

01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:53.420
Thank you to Clinton McElroy, his wife Carol who made the journey with him and keeps him

01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:55.580
from wandering into traffic.

01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:59.660
Thanks to Sam from AEG who helped put the show together.

01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:00.660
Thank you, Sam.

01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:04.420
Thanks to the Balboa, always a beautiful place to do a show.

01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:05.420
We really appreciate it.

01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:06.420
45 seconds.

01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:07.420
Love you.

01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:11.420
We'll be back tomorrow to do Taz, but it's going to be a good one.

01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:12.420
What?

01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:13.420
Griffin?

01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:14.420
What's wrong, Griff?

01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:17.060
HBO Max is denying you, eh?

01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:20.620
Amazon Prime wants my five-digit video pin.

01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:21.620
That's a minute.

01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:22.620
Goddamn it.

01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:25.300
59.93, he didn't do it.

01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:29.420
Griffin sucks, everybody.

01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:30.420
Griffin as a reccom...

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:36.020
Oh, thanks to Montaigne for the use of our theme song, My Life is Better with You.

01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:38.580
Griffin, seeing as you failed the bet...

01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:44.420
I spent $7 to rent Space Jam 1.

01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:45.420
I'd like to hear your...

01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:50.100
To win an imaginary contest.

01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:56.220
I would like, as recompense, I would like to hear your impression of Bugs Bunny telling

01:11:56.220 --> 01:12:00.020
everybody how badly you fucked up.

01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:05.380
Shhh, you don't want to miss this, folks.

01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:09.180
I've heard it's Bugs and it's out of this world.

01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:15.620
Nyeh, I, nyeh, what a, what a fucking idiot.

01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:18.620
Griffin, he's Justin McElroy.

01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:20.620
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:21.620
Griffin McElroy.

01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:36.980
This has been My Brother, My Brother, Me, Kids, Your Dad, Square on the Lips.

01:12:36.980 --> 01:13:03.740
This has been My Brother, My Brother, Me, Kids, Your Dad, Square on the Lips.
