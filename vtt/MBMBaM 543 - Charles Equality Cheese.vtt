00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Here come the McElroys, we've got jokes and bits.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
We're gonna give advice and do funny sticks.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Laughter, it is in store.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Come inside and see, it's time to start.

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
It's my brother, my brother and me.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
Woof woof, dog pound, I'm your mangiest brother, Travis McElroy.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Uh, who's got a bone?

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
I'm Griffin McElroy, I apologize, I did not commit to the bit.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
I've been practicing mine all week.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Yeah, sorry everybody.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Sorry.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
I've been working with Bruce Valanche to script mine, Griffin.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
I can't, I put the time in, I paid premium, top dollar.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
For that Bruce Valanche educational cameo.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Bum bum bum bum bum bum.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Wow.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Oh.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Bum bum bum bum bum bum.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Alright.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
I want a munch.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Squad.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
For America.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Bum bum.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
I want to munch for America.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Bum bum bum bum bum.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Hello, welcome to Munch Squad, it's a podcast within a podcast.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Profiling the latest and greatest in brand eating.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Justin, sorry to interrupt, just to be a bit of a pedant.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
It is kind of a podcast before a podcast at this point.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
It's kind of our opener.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Yes.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
It's a pre-roll podcast.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
So I guess, you know, it's a, it's a weird time to be recording a podcast.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
We usually record on Thursdays and last Thursday we were like,

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
we don't know what the fuck is happening.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Well, to be fair, we didn't want to record on Thursday and our reasoning is

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
we don't know, we don't know what Monday is like,

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
but now we're looking at publishing this one Tuesday morning after recording it Thursday afternoon

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
and we're still like, I don't know what fucking 5pm looks like.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Yeah.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
So that's where we're at.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
And what is the question on everybody's lips?

02:19.000 --> 02:28.000
Well, it's where does pizza stand on election integrity as the bedrock of American democracy?

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
And of course everybody knows that this has been a wild time in America

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
and I feel like everybody's got to speak out and everybody's got to speak up

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
for what they think is important, right?

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Hey, just real quick.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
Is this a new indicator, much like the it's been a tough year for everyone kind of thing?

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Yeah, this is, what do you mean a new indicator?

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
Is this something like a new buzzword, a new pull quote?

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
Is Domino's going to be out there and be like, election integrity is our whole shit?

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
No, Griffin, but Pizza Inn is.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Pizza Inn?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Pizza Inn?

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Pizza Inn is a chain of pizza restaurants.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
Pizza Inn, there's like a bunch of them and there may not be one near you, like Captain Inn,

03:10.000 --> 03:18.000
but there's locations all over this great land of ours, mainly in the Southeast of America.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
There's some in Texas, Griff.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
You could go to a Pizza Inn right now if you wanted to.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
There's 32 in Texas.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Cool.

03:25.000 --> 03:31.000
Based on this segment, it sounds like, Justin, that might be a morally difficult dining decision on my part.

03:31.000 --> 03:38.000
Okay, well, let's just talk about it and let's talk about what's happening in America through the lens of pizza.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Yeah.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
Because I'm taking a stand and it's a very small stand, but it's a stand I feel like I, Justin McElroy, could impact.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Okay.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Okay.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
I'm going to read you the press release, right?

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
And Pizza Inn releases as a press release.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
Can I just say, I'm sorry, Pizza Inn is a terrible name for a restaurant.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
Unless you're allowed to sleep there if you eat too much, I do not get the tie-in.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Yeah, confusing.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Yeah, it is confusing.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
I want to thank Jasper and Megan for sending this one along.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
I appreciate this.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
I probably wouldn't have heard about it otherwise.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
Pizza Inn, this press release has said to me, the original press release on PR Newswire was deleted.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
So I actually don't know what was happening there.

04:21.000 --> 04:29.000
The good news is Pizza Inn has left this entire 20 tweet chain on their page.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
So let's just get right into it.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
Pizza Inn is calling for election reform.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Here's the tweets.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Big money out of politics.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
I'm all for that.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Like, is that what we're talking about?

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Pizza Inn takes bold stance for election reform.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
Widespread concerns over fraud, demand commonsense, changes to...

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Oh, not that Pizza Inn.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Hashtag election fraud.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Hashtag Washington, D.C.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Hashtag January 6th.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
This was tweeted January 5th, which as far as timing for shit goes, it's a pretty bad timing, Pizza Inn.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
I will go ahead and give you that one.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Pizza Inn can't get on an airplane now.

05:03.000 --> 05:10.000
It is squarely focused on creating a close-knit community centered on traditional American values.

05:10.000 --> 05:18.000
And these values include the preservation of American democracy, which millions of brave men and women have fought to protect.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
I'm with them so far.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Well, I'm not.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Well, Justin, I don't know how I feel about it.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Well, hey, listen.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Now we can all, as great Americans, we can all...

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
There's only one great American I like, Justin, and that's the cookie.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Well, Bill Nye also.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Nope.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Okay.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
I'm off Bill Nye now, too.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Just great American cookie and great American ballpark.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Two great Americans that I like.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
As the new year begins, our nation continues to be divided at the results of the recent election.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
I mean, not really.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Not super.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Not really.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
I feel like it's settled.

05:50.000 --> 05:58.000
Millions of Americans believe that widespread voter fraud may have changed the results of the presidential election, says Pizza Inn.

05:58.000 --> 06:04.000
The next tweet, Pizza Inn has laid out their theme, right?

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
And you're like, no way is Pizza Inn going to go any harder than this.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
And then Pizza Inn's like, we believe this is probable.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Take it from us.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Pizza Inn, we believe the fix is in.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Holy shit.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
Like most Americans, we are alarmed by the uncertainties and resulting lack of faith in our election system.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Most Americans, huh?

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
Brandon Solano, chief executive officer of Rave Restaurant Group Incorporated.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
What a bold and incorrect stance.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
I am so sick of these fucking celebrity Twitter accounts telling me what to think.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Politics elite.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Pizza Inn, this is so crucial.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
Pizza Inn is not advocating to overturn the election.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Oh, thank God.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
Nor do we think hastily certifying the results in Congress tomorrow is appropriate.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Well, now hold on.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
Those aren't equal.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
We fully understand the risks of wading into such heated political waters.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
Now, here's where I do want to have you go ahead and take a step back here.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
January 5th tweet from Pizza Inn.

07:06.000 --> 07:12.000
Do you think you fully understand the risks of wading into such heated political waters on January 5th?

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
Because I think, my friend, you don't actually.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
You actually don't understand.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
You may have even underestimated it a little bit.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
A little bit.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Maybe just a pinch.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Here's a tweet.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
We at Pizza Inn aren't constitutional scholars.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Oh?

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Fuck yeah.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Cool.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
Every pizza chain should have to tweet that.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Hey, Pizza Hut.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Well, we got one, don't we?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Yeah, we got Robby.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Robby dropped out.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
All right, Robby dropped out.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Oh, damn it.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
He didn't get it.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Two years?

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
No, he did two years.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Not bad.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
We at Pizza Inn aren't constitutional scholars.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
We're experts at making amazing pizza and salads.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
That is when governors and other elected officials are shutting down our dining rooms.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Now, hold on.

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
The second part does not change the first part, factually speaking.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Well, now that our dining rooms are closed.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
It's almost like you're tipping your hand a little bit.

08:08.000 --> 08:14.000
Congratulations to them by making it 20 tweets and being like, listen, we don't know what happened here.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
We're just thinking transparency is important.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
Also, these fucking mask weenies, right?

08:19.000 --> 08:27.000
Yeah, come get our dirty, sloppy, germy pizza with extra sauce and extra fucking microbes, baby.

08:27.000 --> 08:33.000
Let me get one mushroom sausage and some fucking Spyro Keats on it, baby.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
I'm not going to read them because it's garbage.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
But like Pizza Inn then goes so far as to we are literally 20 tweets in at this point.

08:40.000 --> 08:52.000
Pizza Inn then goes so far as to spend two bullet pointed tweets detailing exactly what changes they require in election integrity.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
I would say voter suppression from Pizza Inn.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Pizza Inn wants to suppress your votes.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
Pizza Inn wants to definitely suppress the shit out of the votes.

09:01.000 --> 09:08.000
Now, to be fair, Justin, they did offer in tweet 27 that if you bring in your mail-in ballot instead of mailing it in,

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
they will give you one free personal pan pizza.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Not bad there.

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
Pizza Inn on January 5th, the last tweet in this chain was,

09:19.000 --> 09:26.000
Pizza Inn respects citizens' rights to agree or disagree with us, boycott us or visit us in solidarity.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
We simply ask that each of us remain civil in our discussions,

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
confident in the knowledge that we love our country and want what's best for it on January 5th.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
This is hot shit.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
If only they'd seen.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
If only they knew how to delete tweets.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
If only they'd seen. If only they knew.

09:46.000 --> 09:54.000
I mean, they also, it looks like they have tweeted at every seditionist member of Congress.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Yeah, they basically copied all of them like,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Hey, do you guys ever backs or what?

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Because this is basically our big play.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
Hey Nunez, Nunez, you got us, right?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Yeah.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Can you imagine?

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
We want to become the exclusive pizza of the Trump trains.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
You guys got to get us on board somehow.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
We don't know what Pizza Gate is, but we heard a lot about it.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
We want to get in.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
We want to get in on that.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Pizza Inn.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
Can you imagine anything sadder or from our perspective,

10:22.000 --> 10:28.000
more kind of ironic and delightful than somebody going to Pizza Inn

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
and getting one of their super sloppy micro pizzas that then that gives them COVID.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
And that's not funny as much as then they can't taste anything anymore.

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
And Pizza Inn's fucking shitty pizza is the last thing they ever taste.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
Whenever they think about, they'll be eating a fine fancy steak dinner.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Oh, a Kobe beef, loving it.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
There's that Wagyu.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
How's it taste?

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
I can't taste it.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
But when I think about what food tastes like, I think of fucking Pizza Inn.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
Senator Ted Cruz's favorite pizza.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Oh, I love it.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
Did you guys see the Kevin Sorbo tweets?

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Kevin Sorbo is tearing.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
We're not moving on from this yet.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Oh, sorry.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Thank you.

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
Pizza Inn tweeted this on, again, January 5th.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Uh-huh.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
And did not have a big tweet after that.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
But as like recently as a few days ago, people started saying like,

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
Hey, Pizza Inn, how do you think it's going right now?

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
Hey, Pizza Inn, how does this look in hindsight for you?

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
How does this feel to you right now?

11:33.000 --> 11:40.000
I'll give you a sampling here because a lot of people started coming for Pizza Inn.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I like this one from Juan Brown who said,

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
No comment on today's news and no cactus bread.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
This is why Pizza Ranch will always be superior.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Fuck yeah, Juan, get them.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Get them.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Fucking get them.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Pizza Ranch isn't about sleeping there.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
It's about riding there.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Yeah.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Pizza Inn responded to Juan Brown,

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
which is absolutely where you need to make a statement like this.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:01.000 --> 12:07.000
It replies to a tweet from a person with 164 followers.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
We condemn the shameful display of violence shown at our nation's capital.

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
We have always and will continue to call for civility and nonviolence from us.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Also, sorry about the cactus bread thing.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
Listen, cactus bread was a real fuck up on our part.

12:23.000 --> 12:32.000
Then they responded to literally like 15 other people with the same verbatim tweet.

12:32.000 --> 12:43.000
So I saw this today and in a rare example of trying to like shape Munch Squad to my own means.

12:43.000 --> 12:50.000
And the reason I wanted to hold this episode's recording until today was I wanted to take a stand.

12:50.000 --> 12:56.000
And I'm asking the other pizza chains to take a stand as well.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
I tweeted this incredible pizza in thread,

13:00.000 --> 13:08.000
and then I called on Domino's, Marco's Pizza, Papa John's Pizza Hut, Chuck E Cheese, Little Caesar's, Mellow Mushroom, and fuck it, DiGiorno,

13:08.000 --> 13:14.000
to announce where they stand on the importance of a peaceful transfer of power as a core tenet of American democracy.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
And I told them it's time to take a stand.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
Now, right now, let me go ahead and see where we're at.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Yeah, got any bites?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Well, it seems like a grounder to me, right?

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Yeah, seems like an easy decision.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
Especially with Shaq at the helm over at P. John's.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Okay, you know, Shaq loves democracy.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Yeah, I'm not seeing any.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
Okay, so far, none of those brands have taken me up on my offer,

13:39.000 --> 13:46.000
which is weird if you think about it, because I'm opening the door for them to say the very easy thing,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
and they are declining that door.

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
Pizza In wanted to say the hard thing, and no one asked Pizza In to say it,

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
but they were like, hold on a second, we've got something to say.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
They were like, hold my beer.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
And then everybody from a hundred miles away was like, who are you talking to?

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
There is no one.

14:03.000 --> 14:09.000
Set your beer on the floor, because there's nobody around you right now.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
What is there to hold your beer?

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Hey, Justin?

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Yeah?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Did you reach out to Totino's?

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
No, I figure I knew where they stand.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
Also, they've given us a lot of money to do a sponsored episode for them,

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
so I'm not going to put them on blast.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
What am I, some sort of freethinking hippie liberal?

14:24.000 --> 14:30.000
No, I kept this peaceful protest to the companies that have not lined our pockets.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Fair, fair, fair.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
At any point, that I know of.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
I want to talk about fucking Kevin Sorbo for a second.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Okay, yeah, bud, Kevin Sorbo.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Motherfucking Hercules, more like Jercules.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
He tweeted a series of tweets, like, it's happening.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Four fucking rad tweets.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
Like, it's happening, and then like, oh yeah, this is awesome.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
And then like, hey everybody, don't act like Antifa.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
And then the fourth tweet is, I'm hearing it wasn't really protest,

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
you're just Antifa dressed like Trump supporters.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
Such a wonderful, like, uh, uh, uh.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
You know what I heard?

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
My uncle told me that he was actually just Antifa.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
And then fucking Louie Lawless, my girl, came out of nowhere,

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
and was like, you look like a dumb shit.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
It was so good.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
It was pretty fucking yummy.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
Where does Eola stand on all this, Trav?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
He's an independent.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Our Hercules reporter on the ground.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
He's an independent.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
What a fucking, what a fucking week.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Huh?

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
We went back and forth, guys, about how to do this one.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
I don't fucking know.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
It's wild out there.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
It's literally, while we are now, while we are recording this,

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
the US Department of State website just updated to say

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
that President Trump's term ended just now.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
And everybody's like, is this real?

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Is this fake?

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Like, there's not a great window for us to do a show.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Hold on.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
I don't think it is.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
I don't think it's, I think it's probably a goof.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
You know how they do a lot of great goofs.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
It's probably a fun goof, but like.

15:53.000 --> 15:59.000
I just want to say, just to sort of place an import on it as well,

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
you know, hit up the pizza places and ask them where they stand.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
But also, I would encourage you to go to 5calls,

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
number5calls.org, and contact your representatives.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
It's great.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
They have a list of active issues that you can kind of choose your own adventure,

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
and it'll give you some tips on how to contact your reps.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
And there's so many of them right now.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
There's so many.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
There's so many.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
There's a lot of different issues.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
There's a lot of different things that you should,

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
there's a lot of different accountability subjects that are worth following through.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
And the number one is, where does the pizza company stand?

16:32.000 --> 16:38.000
No, that's actually just the number one in the ones we might have some theoretical possibility.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
That's the one that, we can move the chains on that one,

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
but you can move the chains on everything else.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Number5calls.org, do it.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Make it a habit.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Make that your fucking hobby for 2021.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
That's big dog run energy right there.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Oh, yeah, it is.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
Hey, can I say, can we speak on that for a moment?

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Let's speak on big dog run for a moment.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
I want to speak on big dog run.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
I was thinking about it and I was having some fun because our friend,

16:58.000 --> 17:04.000
it's not a big deal, it's just a lot of our famous beloved friends were calling me

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
to tell me how much they loved the episode.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
And they're like, you did it.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
You crushed it.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
And I was chatting with them and I was thinking like,

17:11.000 --> 17:17.000
we did that on Monday and then things got weirder,

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
so much weirder and worse, like right after that.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
Hold on, they got really good Tuesday night.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Tuesday night was like, fuck yeah.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
What happened Tuesday night?

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
Oh, that's when the Democrats took the Senate.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
Well, that wasn't official until the next, you know what I'm saying?

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
That's true, that's fair, that's fair.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
It was so wild, but anyway.

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
Let's just say I was feeling a lot of big dog run energy from Tuesday evening

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
to I'll say Monday around 11 o'clock central time.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
And then that energy left me.

17:47.000 --> 17:55.000
I was so grateful for big dog run because I was trying to think of what theme

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
we could have picked in the year that would have been instantly undone

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
and subverted by the offense of the past week.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Yeah.

18:03.000 --> 18:08.000
And actually big dog run is the literal only theme that wouldn't have been just

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
like absolutely trouts.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
Anything inspirational or uplifting would have been instantly undone.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
But big dog run, you know what it is?

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
What's that Justin?

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
It's a mantra.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
It doesn't mean anything.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
It's something for you to meditate on and you take away from it whatever.

18:24.000 --> 18:29.000
You come to it innocently and effortlessly and you just kind of see what comes of it

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
of racing on big dog run.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
We learned about this on Schmaners.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
There is a German saying of like, this is sausage to me.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
And I love it because like, I don't know how much that actually means,

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
but it's a good response to a lot of things, much like no bones about it.

18:46.000 --> 18:51.000
Like that is something like you could say if someone was upset or happy or sad,

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
you'd be like, yeah, man, I know.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
No bones about it.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
That's bad.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
You know, like it kind of fits a lot of difference in here.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
No, this is sausage to me, which also kind of goes with big dog run

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
because them fellows love sausage.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Let me just say, though, I'm worried.

19:06.000 --> 19:16.000
I got worried a little bit that maybe the insurrectionist terrorists had listened to our program

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
and thought like, here comes, this is our brand of big dog run energy.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
I don't know about you guys.

19:21.000 --> 19:27.000
I was scanning that crowd looking for, well, it would be big dog brand merchandise.

19:27.000 --> 19:34.000
Just cause if that would be a, that would I feel like be a week two re-arrange-o of the catchphrase.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
I think we can all agree, though, that was like little yappy dog energy, right?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
That's not big dog energy.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
That was fucking Ted Cruz energy.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
That's the opposite.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Ted Cruz is a little yappy dog.

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
And listen, before you tweet us, I love little yappy dogs.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
I'm talking about stereotypical little yappy dog behavior.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
You know what I mean?

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
That Ted Cruz, he's a little yappy dog.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
I could talk about how much I hate Ted Cruz all day long.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Please do.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Okay.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
Well, you see the thing about it is he's got this clinical case of dick face.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
I see his face.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I just want to punch it.

20:07.000 --> 20:13.000
I would never do that because I'm a law abiding citizen of these great United States.

20:13.000 --> 20:22.000
And I'll continue to just wish him ill from afar like a great American citizen and try to convince Griffin to vote against him one of these days.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Well, I'll get you one day, won't I, Griff?

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Are you kidding me?

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
You know I voted for fucking cool ass skateboard, Beto.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Griffin's a Beto male and you know that.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
I'm a Beto cuck and I love that shit.

20:34.000 --> 20:39.000
It's just like when I see Ted Theodore up there and he's doing his thing and he's like,

20:39.000 --> 20:47.000
and these Antifa, like he's up there and he's talking about how Antifa wants to come and take away all your guns and babies.

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
And I think like, it's like he's not even thinking about what I want.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
He represents my interests.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
He thinks like Griffin's going to love this shit.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
It's no.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
It sucks.

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
Ted Cruz is like, if there was a character in Star Wars who like worked for the Emperor,

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
that the Emperor was constantly like kind of slapping around.

21:05.000 --> 21:11.000
But then the next day also that character showed up and was like dressing like the Emperor and kind of like now doing,

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
he is talking like the Emperor and the Emperor is like, I still don't like you.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
And was still slapping him around.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Ted Cruz has got this energy.

21:18.000 --> 21:24.000
Like if you brought your nine-year-old nephew to TP some people and you got them all hyped up on the drive over and he's like,

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
you're going to fucking get them, aren't we?

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
And we're like, yes, we are, Ted.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Let's get these guys.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
And then you open the door and push Ted out.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
And he ran out.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I'm like, here we go motherfuckers, it's on.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
And you drove away.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
That's Ted Cruz energy right there.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
And he's just like TPing like, yeah, we're getting them guys.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
This is happening now.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
We're getting them.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
See, he kind of seems to me like if you were planning to TP someone,

21:44.000 --> 21:49.000
so he just went ahead five hours early at like 4pm and started doing it.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
And people were like looking out the window like, what the fuck is going on?

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Is there a kid?

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
What is this guy doing?

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
We haven't even had dinner yet.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
Why is he TPing our house now?

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
I'm getting you.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
I mean, you're not even making it up to the trees, Ted.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
You're not unrolling it first.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
You're just throwing whole rolls of toilet paper.

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
It's like he bought a black metal t-shirt at Hot Topic on the way to the concert.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
And then he opens the door like, I love Satan.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Are you guys wild about Satan?

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Me too.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
He's like a non-nark narc.

22:21.000 --> 22:27.000
I also heard, and maybe it's just a rumor, but he pisses his pants on purpose

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
because he likes the warm feeling against his legs.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
He does it and then he tries to-

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
They can't come at me for saying that because of First Amendment.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
He also, I heard he likes to pee his pants and then try to convince other people

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
that they bet him he wouldn't for money.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
But it's like after the fact and they definitely didn't.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
Every day, one of his staffers has to put up with that every day.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
Ted Cruz, Theodore, standing up and saying, yeah, pay up, sucker.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
I pissed the front of my pants again.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Yeah.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Yeah, we don't normally like to get political on this show,

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
but what the fuck else are we going to talk about?

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
I don't know.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
I don't understand that it's Ted Cruz.

23:01.000 --> 23:06.000
I don't think that that's a fair thing to say that we don't like to get political on the show.

23:06.000 --> 23:13.000
Maybe never as explicitly that we do say that Ted Cruz pisses his pants on purpose

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
because he likes the good warm feeling between his legs.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
And to win money from staffers.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
And to win money from staffers, right.

23:19.000 --> 23:24.000
I heard that he creates Facebook pages for TV shows that have been off the air for 20 years

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
that only he watched.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
And then he gets mad when his friends won't join it,

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
even though they didn't watch the show and nobody's even really sure that it existed.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
That's just what I heard.

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
Why won't you guys join my fucking Johnny Bago Facebook page?

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Come on, guys.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Come on.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
The show had both Jake and the Fat Man.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
What's not to like?

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
He created one Facebook group that he just titled that one show

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
that was about a car race across the country.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
And I think that maybe Nathan Fillion was in it.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
It was on Fox for two episodes.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
And people were like,

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Ted, you don't even remember the name of the show.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
And he's like, yeah, but I watched every episode.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Okay.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
So, yeah, we're going to do some advice.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
I want to help.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
God, if we could just help somebody, you know what I mean?

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
Maybe we could like Christmas Carol Ted Cruz.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
Is there something we could do?

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Okay.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
What?

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Okay.

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
What ghost are you going to call them, son?

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Oh, I'm ghost of future, baby.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
I want to shove that fool into an open grave.

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
That was maybe the line crossing.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
You think that's going to be the one that maybe gets old Travis in trouble?

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Yeah.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
To be clear, government,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Travis was talking about only in the context of

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
if they were in a production of a Christmas Carol together.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
And that was the stage directions.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
No, no, no.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
Travis, he wants to push you into an open grave

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
because he was about to fall into a much deeper open grave right next to it.

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
He was on fire and there were three inches of water at the bottom of the open grave.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Yes.

24:56.000 --> 25:01.000
Travis is dressed up as the Grim Reaper and the director's like,

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
all right, now push Ted Cruz into the grave, your co-star.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
And then Travis is like, I don't know if that's such a good idea.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
He's in government.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
And he smells like old piss.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
But Ted Cruz says it's okay to do it.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
Yeah, that's what I meant.

25:18.000 --> 25:23.000
I worry we might lose some people.

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
Well, if we haven't lost him by this point, just in good riddance, folks.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
No, you'd fucking think that.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
But every time I tweet, there's always one person who's like,

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
listen, I've stood by you guys for 10 years, but this is just too far.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Hey, listen.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
What show have you been listening to?

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
The statement Ted Cruz pisses his pants on purpose

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
because he likes the wet, warm feeling between his legs

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
is about as bipartisan as it gets.

25:48.000 --> 25:53.000
Listen, if Joe Biden got up on inauguration day and led with that,

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
full across the aisle support.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Yep, that's the unity that we need right now.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
Hey, State of the Union, it's me, Joe Biden.

26:01.000 --> 26:06.000
Can we all agree that we heard Ted Cruz pisses his pants

26:06.000 --> 26:10.000
to feel the warm feeling on his legs and cheers!

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
There would be everyone's on their feet except Ted Cruz.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Yeah, because it's embarrassing stain.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
Do you guys think we could be sued?

26:19.000 --> 26:27.000
Could we be sued for making a t-shirt with all proceeds donated to a charitable cause?

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
Could we be sued for making a t-shirt that says Ted Cruz likes to piss his pants

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
because he loves the warm feeling between his legs?

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
Because the only thing that you could say is that's slander or libel.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
Well, Justin, all we do is it has to start with...

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
That would require him to, in a court of law, say,

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
I actually don't like the warm feeling between my legs.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
It's unpleasant what I pee with.

26:48.000 --> 26:53.000
No, when I pee my pants, it is on accident and I do not enjoy it.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
Okay, if it says when Ted Cruz pees his pants,

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
he likes the warm feeling between his legs.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
And then if he takes us to court of law, the judge will say,

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
all right, piss your pants, Theodore.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
Demonstrate.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
And then tell us if you like it or not.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
The shirt could also say, I heard Ted Cruz likes to piss his pants.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
And then if he's like, I don't like to piss my pants to feel the warm feeling on my leg,

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
then you say, listen, Ted, just what I heard.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
Just what I heard.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
And when someone says, where did you hear it?

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
You say, well, it came out of my own mouth.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
And then I heard it with my ears.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
There it is.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
Maybe we print it on the inside of a shirt.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Okay.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
Yeah.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
Here's what we do.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
We put the word doesn't,

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
but it's only in heat reactive letters that you can't see.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
Yeah, that's good.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
And then when people are like, I'm going to sue you, you say,

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
hold on right there, and you take an iron.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
Let me take you to the club where the black lights shall reveal.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
All right.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
I actually just got an email from this week's sponsors,

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
and they said, thank you so much for choosing this episode to feature our products in.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Oh, you're so welcome.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
We're so excited to have this be the one.

27:57.000 --> 28:04.000
Let me check, sorry, real quick check of my replies.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
No.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Okay.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
Nothing yet.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
Nothing yet.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Okay, cool, cool, cool.

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
I expected that from delivery, but not Dijona.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
That's pretty good.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Should we go to the magazine?

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Sure.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
We've helped so many people already.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Why not take a break?

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
We can do a question if you want, just to cleanse the palette,

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
or we can come back with a cleansed palette and help some people out.

28:23.000 --> 28:28.000
Yeah, how about before we do go to our sponsors this week, we do it.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
Just a quick Yahoo.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
I got a lot of really good ones this week, and I'm very excited.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
In fact, it's another thing I hate Ted Cruz about,

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
is that he occupied a lot of good Yahoo jokes time.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
This one was sent in by Graham Robach.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Thanks, Graham.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
It's Yahoo Answers User.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
They're anonymous.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
Jed Cruz asks,

28:48.000 --> 28:53.000
ideas for celebrating 13-year-old's first monster energy.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Huh.

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
My son Jackson bought his first monster today,

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
and he promised me he wouldn't drink it before I could throw together a party.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
What should I do for the party?

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
So proud.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
Huge.

29:05.000 --> 29:14.000
This one rides the line of, is it one of those fucking Shrek trolls again?

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
But after this past week, I feel like there's probably some people out there

29:18.000 --> 29:24.000
who would celebrate their 13-year-old son Jackson, spelled J-A-X-S-U-N's,

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
first monster energy he bought with his own allowance, 13 years old.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
I'll tell you, of all the reasons to violate COVID protocols,

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
I think throwing a monster energy party is probably the worst one.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Yeah.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
I don't know.

29:37.000 --> 29:41.000
I think maybe St. Peter might like hearing a new one, you know?

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Yeah, just a new, oh, for monster energy.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Oh, really?

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
Huh.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
A party for it.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Okay.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
I would make the point that you don't want monster energy

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
to be the last thing you tasted.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
It's got to make it something good at least.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
Yeah.

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
I think that it's all about the ceremony of the flavors.

30:00.000 --> 30:06.000
I think he's going to be tempted to, the first time it crosses his lips

30:06.000 --> 30:12.000
and he feels the sort of hot burning of real energy.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
It's so hot.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
The energy comes in fucking so hot.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
He's going to be tempted to bail.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
Yeah.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
And I think you need enough peer pressure in the room that he can't.

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
And after he finishes the can, I think one really important thing to do

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
is to pull up a whole case of it.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
After that, oh, you're so tough.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
Yeah.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
You think you're so cool and tough.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
And make him smoke the whole case.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Yeah, you make him smoke the whole case of monster energy.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
Yeah.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Monster energy's flavors are not as fun and exciting

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
as I hoped that they would be.

30:42.000 --> 30:48.000
Like I hoped there would be one that was like psycho strawberry and fucking.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Oh wait, nevermind.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
I was looking at the wrong part of the website.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
They definitely are pretty out there.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Can you give me a sampling?

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
I mean, oh my.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Uh oh.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Uh oh.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Uh oh.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
There's a camo one.

31:01.000 --> 31:06.000
There's a camo can and it's got the usual monster stuff in it, I guess.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
But it is, oh, it's classic cola plus monster.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
It's monster assault.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
And then this is on the website.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
At Monster, we don't get too hung up on politics.

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
We're not for the war against the war or any war for that matter.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Cool shit, Monster.

31:22.000 --> 31:26.000
You're not for the war against the war or any war.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
We'll leave the politics to the politicians to keep doing what we do best.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Make the meanest energy drinks on the planet.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Declare war on the ordinary.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
Yikes, I don't know.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
Grab a monster assault and viva la revolution.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
It says this on the website.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
Monster, you need to update your shit.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
You gotta update it.

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
What I would recommend for the party is to just do the traditional kind of thing

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
where you put the can of monster energy on one side

31:56.000 --> 32:02.000
and then you get lines of warriors with pain sticks on either side

32:02.000 --> 32:07.000
and as Jackson moves down, he gets shocked by the pain sticks as he chants,

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
today I'm a warrior.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
I must show you my heart.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
I travel the river of blood.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
And if you're doing this, you gotta do muscle monster,

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
the protein chocolate energy shake.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
Oh, absolutely.

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
And then he reaches the end, he drinks it,

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
and now he has reached the age of ascension.

32:26.000 --> 32:30.000
And now he is officially a warrior at that point.

32:30.000 --> 32:35.000
What's the point of getting jacked on monster energy energy

32:35.000 --> 32:40.000
and fucking punching the side of a hardy so hard that you break the bones in your hand

32:40.000 --> 32:44.000
if you're not gonna be super strong from all the chocolate protein energy in it as well?

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
You need the energy, absolutely.

32:47.000 --> 32:51.000
You need all this wild energy, but you also need the power to use it.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
And that's the wisdom.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Offer him a choice.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Put the muscle energy drink there,

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
but then also put maybe like the spiritual energy drink there

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
and the emotional energy drink there.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
And he has to choose between the three of those.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
No, because it says on the muscle monster thing on the website,

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
not recommended for children, people sensitive to caffeine, pregnant women, or women who are nursing.

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
And we just say, it's another one of the First Amendment things.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
It's just another First Amendment thing they're stacking up.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
You know where it doesn't say that is over on the page for M-Hydro?

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
Oh.

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
You know how water fucking sucks?

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
Water fucking sucks, dude.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
I drink it and I'm still as tired as I was before.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Here's what it says on the website.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
Water world, 70% of Earth is covered in water.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
It just says that?

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
It just says water world?

33:36.000 --> 33:41.000
Tell me that this copywriter had a word count they had to hit.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
This is what it says.

33:43.000 --> 33:47.000
Water world, 70% of the Earth is covered with water.

33:47.000 --> 33:54.000
You got bottled water from mountains, glaciers, virgin springs, tropical islands, and the Arctic.

33:54.000 --> 34:03.000
There's mineralized, fortified, ionized, electrified, pH balanced, triple filtered, and straight out of the city tap.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
What's the point?

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
You got to hydrate every day, so you might as well enjoy a boost while you're at it.

34:09.000 --> 34:16.000
Monster Hydro, non-carbonated and lightly sweetened with natural flavors to make it thirst quenching and easy drinking.

34:16.000 --> 34:23.000
We added just enough of that monster magic, by which we mean monster we put in water, to get you fired up.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
Here's some flavors, and one of them is called Red Dog.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Oh boy.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
And the next one's called Blue Stream.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
I'm getting so thirsty over here.

34:31.000 --> 34:39.000
You know, I would like this same energy and copywriting to be put towards like sleep aids.

34:39.000 --> 34:43.000
That's just like, hey man, are you ready to sleep like a Viking?

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
Huh?

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
You want to crash at the end of the day like a lightning bolt hitting a tree?

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
Well, then you need to get Big Dog Slumber.

34:50.000 --> 34:55.000
History tells us that Vikings like to sleep on a floating bed of sticks that was on fire.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Well, actually that's not, they are not asleep.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Why did you think they're asleep?

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
You can too.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
With a fucking monster bed fire.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Melatonin Valhalla.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
It's a, no, it's a ritual.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
They're not asleep.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Did you think they were asleep?

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
Certainly not.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Did you know that Vikings didn't even wear horns on their helmet?

35:13.000 --> 35:17.000
Now, take the sleep pill and have a good night's sleep, little baby.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
Did you know every Viking owns 16 axes?

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
It's true.

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
Now, take a little nap, sleepy boy.

35:25.000 --> 35:30.000
How would you like to have the most visceral nightmare you've ever had in your life?

35:30.000 --> 35:34.000
The drink is literally called Monster.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
Oh gosh.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Okay, well let's take a quick break and we're going to go to the Money Zone.

35:44.000 --> 35:49.000
This week's sponsor is of course Monster Energy, who I have recently realized in the past few minutes,

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
we've likely alienated as a potential future sponsor.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
But did you hear me talk about Monster Assault Energy?

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
I don't know that I love that brand.

35:57.000 --> 36:02.000
We are calling on Monster Energy to change their assault branding.

36:02.000 --> 36:22.000
All right.

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
Griffin, I would like to issue you a challenge.

36:25.000 --> 36:30.000
I want you to pretend that I'm an alien who's landed on Earth and I have no idea what socks are

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
and I want you to describe them to me.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Soft shoes inside.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
What are shoes?

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Is this the alien?

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
I'm alien Borg Borg.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Borg Borg.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Borg Borg, please.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Borg Borg feet, you got them?

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
I have 18 feet.

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
Okay, do you cover them or do you just walk around on your spaceship or whatever?

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
I cover them with foot condoms.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Yeah, that sucks, pal.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
Gross.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
No, they're really good and soft and they feel good.

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
Yours also made of alluvium skin?

37:06.000 --> 37:10.000
No, they're made out of really comfortable stuff.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
I mean, I'm talking about Bombas socks.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
I've worn shitty socks.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
Oh, Bombas?

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Why the fuck didn't you just say that?

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
All right.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Yeah, I didn't know because you didn't know what shoes were,

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
so I assume you didn't know what this brand was.

37:21.000 --> 37:26.000
But everybody knows how comfortable and wonderful Bombas socks are.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
You asked me what socks were.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
Why did you waste my time?

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Hey, don't be an asshole, man.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
I'm trying to help you out.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
All right.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
Hey, by the way, bud, partner, it's not a good time to visit.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
Oh, yeah?

37:38.000 --> 37:42.000
Yeah, can you, like, it's cool and we've all been waiting for it

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
and like, you know, Arrival and all that shit.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
Yeah?

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
You know, give us time travel powers or whatever.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
But can you come back once we sort of got it all sorted?

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Should I talk to your leader first?

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
No.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Fuck no.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
Hey, listen, Blorp Blorp.

37:58.000 --> 38:02.000
No, just go to the moon for like a month or so.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
It's still going to be, you know, not great in a month or so,

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
but if you could just, we're kind of in it right now, Blorp Blorp.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
Blorp Blorp, please.

38:11.000 --> 38:15.000
Anyway, if you buy a pair of Bombas socks,

38:15.000 --> 38:19.000
you also give a pair to people experiencing homelessness,

38:19.000 --> 38:25.000
a nice warm and comfortable pair of socks from your friends at Bombas.

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
It's a small comfort that's especially important right now.

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
So if you want, you can give a pair when you buy a pair

38:31.000 --> 38:36.000
and get 20% off your first purchase at bombas.com slash my brother.

38:36.000 --> 38:42.000
That's B-O-M-B-A-S.com slash my brother for 20% off your first purchase.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
Bombas.com slash my brother.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
I am still here, Oldest Brother Justin.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
Tell me, what is a Brooklinen?

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Don't, it's a trap.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
He knows, he fucking knows.

38:53.000 --> 38:57.000
A sheet for a bead?

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
Well, you're mispronouncing it, but you got the idea.

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
Not just any sheets there, Bleep Blorp, but fantastic sheets.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
It's Blorp Blorp, please.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
I apologize.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Bleep Blorp was my father.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
I mainly know human names.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
Oh, they're pretty close-minded of you.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
I love this character, Brooklinen.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
All my ads are going to be so fucking cool.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
I'm not going anywhere.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
I'm any sexy, too.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
What do you look like, Blorp Blorp?

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
I got 18 legs and six-pack abs.

39:29.000 --> 39:33.000
The math on that doesn't exactly track with aesthetic pleasure.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
I've got four boobs.

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
Brooklinen works directly with manufacturers.

39:39.000 --> 39:43.000
Blorp Blorp, you're making me wish I had six hands.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
The other two are to choke you to death.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Oh no, my beautiful swan-like neck.

39:48.000 --> 40:11.000
Brooklinen works directly with manufacturers to make luxury available directly to you without the luxury-level markups.

40:11.000 --> 40:16.000
They've got a variety of sheets, colors, patterns, and materials to fit your needs and tastes.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
Even my needs and tastes?

40:19.000 --> 40:24.000
Brooklinen is also notoriously forgiving for podcasts.

40:24.000 --> 40:29.000
Don't get mad at them when they talk about things that are not directly sheet-related.

40:29.000 --> 40:33.000
But Blorp Blorp, you're going to love these sheets if you haven't tried sheets yet.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
They're still going to be the best ones you'll ever have.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
Oh, I've tried sheets.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
I've got Brooklinen sheets and comforters and pillows and towels.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
I fucking told you.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Even loungewear.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
It's 2021.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
Have something nice for yourself to start the new year.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
To help you do that, Brooklinen has a special offer.

40:48.000 --> 40:55.000
Go to Brooklinen.com and use the promo code MYBROTHER to get $25 off when you spend $100 or more plus free shipping.

40:55.000 --> 41:07.000
That's B-R-O-O-K-L-I-N-E-N.com and then use the promo code MYBROTHER to get $25 off when you spend $100 or more plus free shipping.

41:07.000 --> 41:12.000
Brooklinen.com and use the promo code MYBROTHER at checkout.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Hi, I'm Jo Firestone.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
And I'm Manolo Moreno.

41:16.000 --> 41:25.000
And we host Dr. Game Show, a podcast where listeners submit games and we play them regardless of quality with a dozen listeners from around the world.

41:25.000 --> 41:31.000
We've had folks call in from as far as Sweden, South Africa, and the Philippines.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
Here's an example.

41:32.000 --> 41:41.000
This is a game we've played called Cotton Candy Chicken Nuggets, where you have to sing any eight syllable phrase to the tune of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
You have an example, Manolo?

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
Yeah, here's one.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
Little baby turkey turnips.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Oh, nice.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Thanks.

41:49.000 --> 41:53.000
Dr. Game Show has new episodes every other Wednesday on Maximum Fun.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Check us out.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Please.

42:01.000 --> 42:05.000
B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-update.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
Real quick breaking update.

42:08.000 --> 42:17.000
We still have not gotten any responses from the pizza chains, but I do think there's a reason for that.

42:17.000 --> 42:23.000
As a couple of people pointed out in my Twitter responses, Hida Shura was the first, I believe.

42:23.000 --> 42:28.000
There hasn't been a lot of tweeting going on actually from these particular brands.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
Let's check and see when their last tweets were.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Domino's, January 6th.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
In the morning time?

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
Marco's Pizza, January 6th.

42:39.000 --> 42:43.000
Papa John's last tweet there was January 5th.

42:43.000 --> 42:47.000
I don't think Papa John's gonna be on the right side of history.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Well, they got Shaq in there now.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
I don't know.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
Pizza Hut's last tweet was on January 5th.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
I'm noticing a pattern for sure.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
Little Caesar's last tweet was January 5th.

42:58.000 --> 43:03.000
It's taken them a long time to figure out how did you announce the violence at our nation's capital, huh?

43:03.000 --> 43:08.000
It took them a real long time. DiGiorno, January 5th.

43:08.000 --> 43:17.000
None of the brands have tweeted since the events of January 6th and the failed coup attempt on our nation.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Except for one brand.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
Who?

43:20.000 --> 43:27.000
That had the guts to speak up after these shameful, shameful attacks on our democracy.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
And it's Charles E. Cheese.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Charles Entertainment Cheese. You're telling the me.

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
So wait, so what was that Griff? Charles Entertainment Cheese. Interesting.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
Okay, January 8th.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
Have you ever wondered what the E in Chuck E. Cheese stands for?

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
So have we.

43:44.000 --> 43:54.000
Join Chuck E.'s friends as they go on the game show, Championship Chuck E. Challenge, to guess Chuck E.'s middle name.

43:54.000 --> 44:01.000
And then there's a video that's four minutes long of puppets talking about Chuck E. Cheese and that was tweeted on January 8th.

44:01.000 --> 44:05.000
Okay. Not great.

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
Not great also because it's entertainment and everybody fucking knows it.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
Everybody fucking does know that.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
You know what, Justin? If it helps.

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
This wasn't a response to the failed coup at our nation's capital.

44:16.000 --> 44:21.000
But on the third, we could pretend like this tweet isn't a response to that.

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
We're bummed to hear your experience wasn't what you had hoped for.

44:24.000 --> 44:28.000
We'd like to let our guest relations team know about your experience.

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
Message us with your name, phone number, email, store location, and visit date, please.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
So that's not bad.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
That was tweeted to Blork Blork.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
That was tweeted at Q&A.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
Yeah.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
Oh no!

44:40.000 --> 44:44.000
But they were working with the FBI, Griffin. It was a sting operation.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
Yeah.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
We didn't watch the video.

44:46.000 --> 44:50.000
Maybe at some point during the Charles Entertainment Cheese puppet video, they're like,

44:50.000 --> 44:59.000
let's explain how these accusations of voter fraud are historically mired in white supremacy and let's just all unpack that right now.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
It doesn't end with Trump.

45:01.000 --> 45:06.000
Maybe there is a very thoughtful discussion of that because everybody knows the dude's middle fucking name.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Equality.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
Yeah.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
It's not.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
It's Charles Equality Cheese.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Wait, what were you going to say?

45:13.000 --> 45:21.000
What I'm going to say is I'm really excited to read the Splitsider article about this episode,

45:21.000 --> 45:25.000
or perhaps the AV Club will get this one where they're like, I can't believe they did it.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
A lot of people thought they couldn't do it.

45:27.000 --> 45:34.000
They couldn't thread the needle and make an episode in the wake of the failed coup on our nation.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
But they did it.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
The boys had the perfect tone throughout the entire episode.

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
You almost forgot the kind of tumultuous landscape.

45:42.000 --> 45:46.000
We were living in as they whisked us away to entertainment town.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
But not in an escapist way.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
You know what I mean?

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
Like it still kept you grounded.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
They fixed it all.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
Well, they didn't fix it because that would have been disingenuous.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Now they had the perfect balance.

45:56.000 --> 46:03.000
Hey Griffin, what do you think was the most effective thing about this episode so far and how it's dealt with the ongoing strife in our nation?

46:03.000 --> 46:11.000
I think it's probably when we talked about the fact that isn't it silly that Chuck E Cheese did a funny video right after the thing happened.

46:11.000 --> 46:16.000
But also that's what we're doing right now.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
Not really.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Not exactly the same.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
It was kind of.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
A bit the same.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
But we're at least mentioning it.

46:23.000 --> 46:24.000
Yeah.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
Yeah.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
And we're talking about it.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
And we are taking something to the stand.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
But we don't have Skee-Ball.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
We don't have Skee-Ball.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
You're right.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
We don't have Skee-Ball.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
So it pretty much balances out.

46:34.000 --> 46:38.000
We're taking a stand and Chuck E Quality Cheese has Skee-Ball.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
So it's balanced at this point.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
Yes.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
I just don't know.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
We didn't know what to say.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
I don't know what to say.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
I don't know if it's appropriate.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
We've talked about this.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
When is a good time?

46:48.000 --> 46:55.000
We don't want to be a distraction from the important things going on because I think it's important to pay attention and to act.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
What's that address again, Griff?

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
The URL that people should go to right now?

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Number5Calls.org.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
5Calls.org.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
You should go there and do something.

47:03.000 --> 47:08.000
But at the same time, there's not going to be a cool time to do jokes.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Hopefully in the future.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
I hope.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
This is a wild suggestion, right?

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
This might be completely out of that field for us.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
It's not something we normally do.

47:17.000 --> 47:22.000
But maybe we could answer a question from somebody for advice.

47:22.000 --> 47:29.000
I know this may sound peculiar, but I'm wondering how to find a child, preferably more than one.

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
That's the end of the question.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
No, no, no.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
Okay, then go on.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
Sorry, there's more.

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
I missed it.

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
There's more.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
To read my middle grade sci-fi novel.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
That must be, maybe it's a British thing.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
Who knows?

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
Middle grade.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Maybe it's for middle school.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
No, I use context clues to figure it out.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
I'm just trying to figure out who says middle grade.

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
Anyway, I've just finished my first book, and I would like a kid's opinion.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Unfortunately, I'm 25, and none of my friends...

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Man, I wish I was 25.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
You are a kid.

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
And none of my friends are old enough yet to have kids in middle school.

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
I don't have any younger siblings or cousins I can poach either.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
When my fellow adults read it, the reactions were good,

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
but their opinions, while nice, are not the most important ones.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
I'm willing to pay said kids for their time,

48:08.000 --> 48:12.000
but asking to rent a child seems like a tricky subject to broach with a stranger.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
Yup.

48:13.000 --> 48:17.000
How do I find children who can tell me ways to improve my writing?

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
And that's from Jamie.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
And here's my advice, Jamie.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Maybe you could upload it to Fortnite.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
No, that's not bad.

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
Do they do books in Fortnite?

48:27.000 --> 48:31.000
Yeah, when you're hiding from other people trying to dance on you or whatever,

48:31.000 --> 48:35.000
they're like, do you want a book?

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
Yeah, they leave them around like a doctor's office.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
You just pick up a manuscript, leaf through that real quick.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Oh, laser fight.

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
Oh no, he flossed me, or whatever.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
Yeah, okay.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
I think I follow.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
You know, another one.

48:50.000 --> 48:54.000
You could just loiter around a park.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
No, no.

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
You know what?

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
Never mind.

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
There's no way.

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
Let's rule out physical, in-person.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
I mean, there's an ongoing pandemic also.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
It's another thing to keep in mind.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
I think purely digital strategies.

49:06.000 --> 49:13.000
And so far, I think it's going to be difficult to beat Fortnite.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
What's the one?

49:14.000 --> 49:19.000
You know, I think it is unfair that the website is called AO3,

49:19.000 --> 49:23.000
and there's also a very well-known person named AOC,

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
because I have a really hard time separating those two,

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
and I always want to say you could upload your story to AOC,

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
and then it would be completely different.

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
But she might give you some good feedback.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Yeah, and she could maybe signal blast it

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
to some of her middle school-aged followers.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Maybe, if she has those.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
I assume she probably does.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
She probably does.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
She's a big influence on the younger generation.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
I had to...

49:48.000 --> 49:52.000
In middle school, I had to read grown-up books.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
Uh-huh.

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
I had to read Red Badge of Courage.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Yeah, classic grown-up book.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
I had to read...

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Call of the Wild.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
I had to read Hatchet.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
No.

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
You've got to read grown-up old-ass books,

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
so I don't see why...

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
I fucking read a good Earth.

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
I read ordinary fucking people in middle school.

50:15.000 --> 50:19.000
I just think that good literature is good,

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
and so you don't need a kid's seal of approval.

50:21.000 --> 50:25.000
If kids can read grown-up books,

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
I guess we can't read teen books, huh?

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Well, Griffin, you have your money or something.

50:29.000 --> 50:33.000
Hey, Jamie, kids don't scot some money.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
You're selling it to grown-ups.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Grown-ups are buying it for their middle school kids.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
If your grown-up friends like it,

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
put on the cover some space aliens and laser gun fight,

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
but also they're reading books and respecting their parents.

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
But it's the parents.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Yeah, it's the parents who are getting it,

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
so you need a character on the front of the book

50:48.000 --> 50:52.000
who is respectful and doing homework

50:52.000 --> 50:58.000
and will sit still for video calls with Uncle Shaq.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Whoa, that dude just came out.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
You know, we're sitting here talking about

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
the importance of reading for young people,

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
and gosh, it is so important.

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
Are we?

51:05.000 --> 51:08.000
I'm sitting here very reminded of when...

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
Griffin was talking about the boring adult buzz

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
he had to read, and it reminded me of

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
when I was in elementary school,

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
there was this program where you got points.

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
Oh, yeah, Accelerated Reader.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Book it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
No, not book it. That's for fucking pizzas.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
You got pizza points, though.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
Accelerated Reader was this program in school

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
where you read books and you get points for it.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
Accelerated Reader program.

51:25.000 --> 51:29.000
And I was just recalling how if your parents read books,

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
they could get points for you as well.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
What? Really?

51:32.000 --> 51:36.000
I remember Dad reading The Virginian to get points,

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
and then he had to do a quiz

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
where he answered questions about The Virginian.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
And I'm sitting here thinking about that now

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
as a 40-year-old man.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
I'm thinking, how the fuck did that help me?

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
Hey, Justin?

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
I don't understand what I gleaned from that.

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
Is that real, or was Dad cheating for you?

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
No, Dad was... I mean, this was in person.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
He had to go in.

51:55.000 --> 51:59.000
He came down to the school to take a test on The Virginian?

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
It was pre-COVID.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
Of course it was pre-COVID, Justin.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
That's the part I'm worried about.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Travis, we did things a little differently back then.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
A little differently back then.

52:08.000 --> 52:12.000
I remember Accelerated Reader, it showed you the points,

52:12.000 --> 52:16.000
how many points you could get based on the boringness

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
of the book, basically, is essentially what it was.

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
And I loved running the arithmetic in my head

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
that I could read Last of the Mohicans,

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
or for an equal number of points,

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
I could read 12 anamorphs.

52:29.000 --> 52:33.000
I think I'll go for 12 anamorphs this time.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Mr. Fenimore Cooper, catch you next time.

52:35.000 --> 52:39.000
I won Accelerated Reader by reading the Bible,

52:39.000 --> 52:44.000
and I aced it, aced that test, which I wasn't expecting,

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
but now I can tell you every word of the Bible to this day.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.000
That's true, Travis knows it.

52:48.000 --> 52:52.000
Travis, give me, what's John 3.15?

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
It's, hey, wait for this great one.

52:55.000 --> 52:58.000
This next one's gonna be a real humdinger.

52:58.000 --> 53:04.000
It says, it says, hold onto your asses,

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
I'm about to blow them away.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
It actually says, one, two, one, two,

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
here comes the new shit.

53:10.000 --> 53:14.000
And it actually says, DJ Khaled, we the best music,

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
which is bizarre to me.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
It says, back me up, Pitbull, which is weird.

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
Which is weird, because Pitbull's not even in the Bible much.

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
Well, not much.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
It says, my name is Jesus, and I'm here to say,

53:24.000 --> 53:28.000
and that just stops, there.

53:28.000 --> 53:31.000
It says, listen to this joke I'm about to make.

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
Oh, no.

53:32.000 --> 53:37.000
Hey, this one's not, this next one's made up.

53:37.000 --> 53:42.000
Hey, it's opposite day.

53:42.000 --> 53:46.000
Here's some dope shit my Uncle Kevin told me.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
John 3.15.

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
John 3.17 is psych.

53:50.000 --> 53:55.000
John 3.15 and John 3.17 are actually both get-or-done.

53:55.000 --> 54:03.000
A lot of people don't know that.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
It's all gonna be fun.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast,

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
my brother, my brother and me.

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
We did our best.

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
I don't know.

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
We're all hanging in there.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
We're all hanging in there.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
We don't know.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
You don't know.

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
You know what?

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
Here is a weird thing.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
You're listening to this on Tuesday.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
We're recording this on Monday.

54:20.000 --> 54:24.000
You are infinitely smarter about the world than we are currently.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
It's kind of like that thing where it's like you get one penny every day,

54:27.000 --> 54:30.000
but then you double it, and how much do you have at the end?

54:30.000 --> 54:34.000
Every day, the world's entirety of knowledge seems to double,

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
and it's a lot to keep up with.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
The Great Gatsby just entered public domain,

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
so we're gonna be reading all that next week.

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
We don't normally promo.

54:41.000 --> 54:44.000
Oh, that one's six animorphs.

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
Hey, thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
Lots of cool shows there.

54:48.000 --> 54:54.000
Cool shows with jokes, some serious ones, and stories ones.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
There you go.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
We're all there on MaximumFun.org.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
I do want to say real quick, over at the merch store,

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
we got a new pin of the month.

55:01.000 --> 55:04.000
It's the three of us as Cerberus,

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
and those go to benefit the NARAL,

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
which fights for access to abortion care, birth control,

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
paid parental leave, and protection

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
from pregnancy discrimination.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
Go check it out.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
There's a bunch of other stuff over there too,

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
mackraymerch.com.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Let's see.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
We got a book.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
The Sawbones book, the Sawbones paperback,

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
came out a couple weeks ago.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
I'm not gonna keep plugging it every week,

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
but if you like weird medical history,

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
we're really proud of it.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
It's a new version.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
The original hardback had some issues.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
This one doesn't.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
It's real good.

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
So please go buy it wherever fine books are sold.

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
It's like two weeks until our podcast book.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Everybody has a podcast except Pete comes out.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
We're having a book launch event for that

55:48.000 --> 55:51.000
on January 26th at 9 p.m. eastern time.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
It's a free virtual event.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
We've partnered with six independent bookstores.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
If you pre-order from them,

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
you'll get an exclusively designed book plate

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
signed by one of us.

56:00.000 --> 56:04.000
You can get that at bit.ly slash mackroypodcastbookevent

56:04.000 --> 56:07.000
for bookstore links and more info.

56:07.000 --> 56:10.000
Also, you're great.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
You're great.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
You're great.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
I think you're the bee's knees.

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
Get in there.

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
Get stuck in.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
No bones about it.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
You want some final?

56:19.000 --> 56:20.000
Yes, please.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
This final Yahoo was sent in by Brett.

56:22.000 --> 56:26.000
It's from Yahoo Answers user question mark.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
So I'm gonna call them.

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
Devin asks,

56:31.000 --> 56:35.000
which lizard can be held the most for teen boy?

56:35.000 --> 56:41.000
I'm Travis McElroy.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.000
This has been My Brother, My Brother.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
May you kiss your dad square on the lips.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Okay, that was the show.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Hope you had some fun.

56:50.000 --> 56:54.000
Talked for an hour and now our job is done.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Go back into the world.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Face the day ahead.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Please don't tell our grandparents

57:00.000 --> 57:05.000
all the cuss words we said.
