WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.960 --> 00:49.960
It's better it's better

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
It's better it's better

01:00.260 --> 01:02.260
Better it's better

01:10.460 --> 01:15.420
Hello everybody welcome my brother my brother me and advice you for the imaginary. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

01:15.420 --> 01:21.140
I'm your middlest brother Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy

01:21.380 --> 01:23.380
Have a question for you guys, you know

01:24.780 --> 01:31.300
Wait, what is it? Say the question? First of all, calm down. Okay, I'll say the question calmly

01:31.780 --> 01:35.780
In a way that we can that we will be able to understand it. Yeah

01:35.940 --> 01:40.540
Well, so I have an icebreaker so that we can kind of get to know each other love that gum

01:41.740 --> 01:44.260
Yeah, I have some gum for you guys and also a question

01:44.260 --> 01:47.520
Um, would you rather? Oh, I love a friend

01:47.980 --> 01:49.980
These are so devilish

01:50.060 --> 01:55.820
Mm-hmm, but friend a I'm gonna say like magical alien who's just trying to get home a man

01:55.820 --> 01:59.980
Oh, yeah, that's kind of a hat on a hat. Don't you think? Well, you don't like ET had like

02:00.460 --> 02:04.380
It was like they said he's not magical enough. He has to have powers too, which is wild

02:05.140 --> 02:07.140
But like a magical alien

02:07.140 --> 02:10.140
That's like sci-fi like that's sci-fi. That's just his like

02:10.140 --> 02:15.020
Science physiology. Yeah. Okay, so it's not magic. Well, how would you put it?

02:16.180 --> 02:21.260
His sci-fi physiology his body can do different stuff. Okay an alien with abilities

02:21.260 --> 02:26.420
How about that? Like when you see a goose fly in the air? Are you like, whoa, I can't do that magic

02:26.820 --> 02:30.300
Okay, so an alien who's trying to get home like it's just his body can do

02:31.020 --> 02:34.220
Or or a ghost trying to solve its own murder

02:35.340 --> 02:39.180
I mean ghosts that is kind of magic cuz it's not real

02:39.180 --> 02:40.420
well

02:40.420 --> 02:45.500
Like as far as you know alien could be real the alien that's like touches a boo-boo and it makes it go better

02:46.020 --> 02:51.780
That could definitely be yeah, but if you've just never seen a bird and I tell you about a bird flying you're like, that's not real

02:52.500 --> 02:57.980
No, I know but if the bird dies and then the bird you see the spirit of the bird fly out of it

02:57.980 --> 03:02.040
I would be like that. How's that real? Well within the world of the would you rather Griffin?

03:02.040 --> 03:04.700
I'm trying to expand your horizons. You don't have to think about

03:04.700 --> 03:09.980
I guess I would do the alien cuz that could be real and the ghost couldn't be real. No, that's the wrong answer

03:09.980 --> 03:11.060
Oh

03:11.060 --> 03:15.500
Well juice didn't even get a chance to I guess. Oh, yeah, I didn't even get a chance to listen to the question

03:15.500 --> 03:17.500
Okay, so would you rather?

03:17.700 --> 03:23.780
Kill someone and have them solve their own murder or kill an alien who's trying to get home. Is the alien bad? I

03:24.620 --> 03:26.620
This is Justin's question. I

03:27.260 --> 03:33.460
Didn't really you didn't specify that before individual people you didn't ask enough questions. Is it the ghost?

03:33.460 --> 03:40.660
Well, so Griffin is on one side of the equation. I was trying to help solve the murder. Yeah, I want to say right now

03:41.460 --> 03:48.300
That in today's day and age and everything and you and look around you. I don't feel like killing anything

03:48.980 --> 03:54.020
Yeah, I'm being a pure love and peace. I would not kill either of these creatures. Okay

03:54.620 --> 04:00.180
We'll cross it then instead of Griffin helping either the ghost of the alien and Justin hurting the ghost the other would you rather?

04:00.180 --> 04:05.640
Griffin help the ghost try to solve its own murder or kill an alien who's trying to get home or Justin

04:05.720 --> 04:09.600
would you rather you kill someone to have the ghost solve its own murder or

04:10.240 --> 04:12.240
Or help an alien trying to get home

04:13.920 --> 04:20.320
But I killed it first cuz it took home state secrets. Are you are you pitting me against Griffin? Yeah

04:20.320 --> 04:23.160
Yeah, so I'm sort of a government bad guy

04:23.200 --> 04:23.700
Yeah

04:23.700 --> 04:30.680
And I I know the alien stole some dates states secrets and it's gonna take him back to his home planet to try to fuck

04:30.680 --> 04:33.420
Us up. I don't think so chick chick. That's my

04:33.920 --> 04:35.920
Gun. Yeah

04:37.320 --> 04:41.160
That your alien is everyone the alien is now dead

04:42.360 --> 04:46.000
No, I was I didn't get to make a sound. Oh, you're too slow. Oh

04:46.000 --> 04:53.040
Oh, you bounced off my armor. Oh, I made armor from detritus around my home

04:53.040 --> 04:59.520
Oh some spaceship detritus. I can't juice. Hold on. Wait, hold on. Wait juice. Hold on. Wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait

05:00.640 --> 05:02.860
Justin no, shush. Just Justin can't be like

05:04.080 --> 05:10.640
Listen to me because I'm gonna make it beautiful and poignant. What if you had the armor on under your shirt?

05:10.640 --> 05:15.280
Oh, yeah, and I see the alien and I'm like, give me back my secrets

05:16.040 --> 05:18.960
and I just open a clip on his

05:19.760 --> 05:24.680
Booty, but then you jump in the way and I think oh I killed my brother

05:24.680 --> 05:30.400
I'm so sad, but then you stand up and you're like, it's okay. I was protected by the armor and it's like crash

05:31.040 --> 05:38.320
And it's like whoa, that's that's now we're in Oscars territory or or back to the future to territory

05:38.320 --> 05:45.320
but in the in the distraction that you've caused the area dig get to go home with his with this with all the state's secrets and

05:45.880 --> 05:49.040
Like a month later, we are gonna get invaded and it's gonna be bad news

05:49.480 --> 05:54.680
No one's helping the ghost solve its own murder just to check. It's not real is though is the only thing I think

05:54.680 --> 05:55.840
I see on the same page

05:55.840 --> 06:00.640
It was a trick question because the ghost was also trying to kill the alien and the ghost snuck on board the ship

06:01.040 --> 06:07.600
Okay, what are what? Okay. Can we start recording now? Yeah, this has been this has been recording button

06:07.600 --> 06:09.600
It's been important stuff. We've done so far

06:09.960 --> 06:11.880
Do you feel that way?

06:11.880 --> 06:16.320
Yeah, cuz I think we're sort of coming up with some really big ideas. Oh

06:16.840 --> 06:21.080
My and asking the big questions. Yeah. Oh my god. This is an advice show and

06:21.840 --> 06:29.580
We are now if I should check the calendar. What is the ETA time time to the TT?

06:30.480 --> 06:32.480
MVB

06:32.480 --> 06:39.320
Just a quick check most valuable brother is that he said no trying to keep us locked in with the

06:39.720 --> 06:44.440
Like the just time stream like to fix us in time. Yeah, it is

06:45.040 --> 06:47.760
We're releasing this episode on the let's see

06:48.400 --> 06:49.680
23rd

06:49.680 --> 06:54.640
23rd. Okay. It is now one calendar month to man vs. B. So that's where we're

06:55.400 --> 06:58.380
I thought hey, here's a something I fucked up on

06:58.380 --> 07:06.520
Mm-hmm speaking of MVB, which well, I just wanted to need to do a little bit because I fucked up. Yeah, I uh, I

07:07.080 --> 07:09.740
I um, I heard that there was a

07:10.760 --> 07:15.680
Mr. Bean Tony box, you know Tony's they're creative Tony's

07:15.680 --> 07:20.840
Yeah, a little action figures and you put them on top of these boxes and they tell you stories. Oh, yeah

07:20.840 --> 07:23.000
Yeah, so I got one because I've been

07:23.000 --> 07:28.960
letting to Cooper choose one if she sleeps there a bed all night, she gets one to play with and

07:29.560 --> 07:30.800
I

07:30.800 --> 07:36.520
Got her one from the UK. This mr. Bean and it tells mr. Bean stories. It's a big problem

07:36.600 --> 07:40.240
No, it's a problem because it does songs. It's just song. Ah

07:40.760 --> 07:47.400
And she has recently told me informed me that mr. Bean is her favorite singer. Oh, no

07:47.760 --> 07:49.760
yeah, so I'm hearing a

07:49.760 --> 07:54.560
a lot a lot a lot a lot of mr. Bean's

07:55.960 --> 08:01.760
Hit tune wait so Ron over on this end. Yeah, that's how things I just need to check Justin

08:01.760 --> 08:07.400
Are these actual songs related to mr. Bean or is it just like you plug it in and it plays some music?

08:08.200 --> 08:14.940
Mr. Bean is just the trigger. Oh, that's such an interesting question Travis. He sings songs

08:15.800 --> 08:18.120
That are about being mr. Bean. Oh, wow

08:18.120 --> 08:20.120
but

08:20.520 --> 08:27.840
He doesn't really sing. He just says his name quite a bit. Oh cool. He's not very verbose as a character

08:27.840 --> 08:34.440
That's not he's much more of a physical presence. Okay. Oh look, I have a sample of one. I can share with you guys

08:34.440 --> 08:39.960
Oh boy, is this hold on? Wait a little bit. Yeah, are we getting into summer jam 2022 territory?

08:39.960 --> 08:46.320
This might be the summer jam of 22. Oh my god this shit 21 million views. Okay ready? Yeah, we go

08:46.320 --> 08:48.320
ready

09:17.320 --> 09:24.840
Do you get what we're going that is incredible as a good song? Yeah now imagine I gave a four-year-old the ability

09:26.320 --> 09:33.480
With my actions I my purchases my evening. I have the four-year-old ability to make that play. Yeah, literally any moment

09:33.480 --> 09:38.800
Yeah that she chooses by placing mr. Bean on top of her Tony box

09:38.800 --> 09:42.600
Do you feel like by the way, she will because it's there her favorite singer

09:42.600 --> 09:49.640
Yeah here when you hear that so I'm Justin you feel like transported to like a really I'm gonna say almost too trendy

09:49.960 --> 09:54.600
underground like English nightclub and that song plays and everyone

09:55.320 --> 10:02.280
Unironically loses their shit and like really goes for it because that's what it transported me. That's what I felt like too

10:02.320 --> 10:06.920
yeah, there were too many hula hoops and you know a lot of neon and

10:06.920 --> 10:13.920
and clothes that don't seem like clothes and then that song comes on and everyone's dancing and I'm there because like a friend invited me

10:13.920 --> 10:18.440
There and I've never been to a place like this and I'm like what the fuck is this song and I kind of laugh and but

10:18.440 --> 10:22.720
When I laugh everyone looks at me and they're like, this isn't why are you laughing? I'm grew. I'm grooving

10:23.280 --> 10:29.480
I'm shaking so hard. I'm shaking so hard right now. Is that what you feel like in your own home one month?

10:30.040 --> 10:35.080
Until MVB I am curious how you all have been sort of preparing and I don't know about y'all

10:35.080 --> 10:42.480
Netflix says is is having some ish issues with retention. Yeah, and they're having a lot of cancellations and it's like guys

10:43.520 --> 10:50.080
You're you're just gonna come back in a month and you're not gonna be grandfathered in to those good subscription rates

10:50.080 --> 10:53.800
You know what? I mean? Like you're gonna come crawling fucking back in one month

10:53.920 --> 10:56.240
I'm never letting go my subscription by the way

10:56.240 --> 11:01.800
I'm still getting DVDs in the mail whenever I want they can't get rid of that because he's in my contract

11:01.800 --> 11:07.000
I'm getting three a week as long as I watch them and return them on time. There's not a fucking thing they can do

11:07.000 --> 11:12.360
I'm still hold on to a copy of Stuart little too and they have said nothing about it because Netflix is really cool and my

11:12.360 --> 11:16.840
Friend. Yeah, they're like so chill about every yeah facet of their business

11:17.560 --> 11:19.520
Like everything that they do

11:19.520 --> 11:25.160
Do you guys want to hear the some of the comments on the pizza bean video that mr. Bean did where he made pizza in

11:25.160 --> 11:30.660
A video. Oh sure. I was looking for the pizza bean song. I couldn't find it. That's a shame but comment. Yeah, I feel that

11:30.660 --> 11:35.260
Mr. Bean is the best. He makes me laugh so hard on every single video that he does

11:35.260 --> 11:37.900
I love mr. Bean because he makes me laugh out loud

11:38.580 --> 11:40.540
God bless you. Mr. Bean

11:40.540 --> 11:45.580
This is the best thing I say all day. I love mr. Bean always makes me laugh. God bless and protect mr. Bean

11:45.820 --> 11:49.900
You made my child of mr. Bean when you first are reading those Justin

11:49.900 --> 11:54.800
I had confused what you had said and I thought those were comments by mr. Bean on mr. Bean videos

11:55.020 --> 11:59.780
And for a second, I was like, wow, there's some powerful marketing choices another great one Rowan

11:59.780 --> 12:03.660
You've done you've done it again. Should we do a live stream?

12:04.300 --> 12:06.300
I've watched my whole

12:06.740 --> 12:13.020
How to capitalize on I mean, let's talk a little bit of MVB because it's been a little bit

12:13.020 --> 12:17.860
Yeah, it's been like and it's really one of the things that makes me genuinely so happy

12:18.860 --> 12:24.720
To talk about I feel like the best version of it. Yeah is us like

12:25.780 --> 12:28.100
live-streaming us watching

12:28.100 --> 12:33.820
Yes, all of and you can tune it. You can tune it. We can make a day of it

12:33.820 --> 12:35.820
How many episodes at ten episodes, huh?

12:37.940 --> 12:43.780
Is it all dropping at once or is it like weekly releases don't tease me mr. Bean

12:47.580 --> 12:53.940
You can't tease me mr. Bean I can't wait that long you can't leave me on cliffs between each one

12:53.940 --> 12:59.460
I'm hanging there waiting for the beans to drop. I'll die. I'll die. I'll have a little heart attack

12:59.460 --> 13:03.060
Like is he gonna win is the be gonna win? I don't know you can't you got it

13:05.660 --> 13:10.140
Paired for the seven episode seven turn when you're like, maybe I want the B to win

13:10.140 --> 13:15.260
You know that's fucking coming right anybody's not rooting for the B from the start is out of there

13:15.260 --> 13:19.860
There is no I'm gonna call it. There's no way they're still fighting at the end of it by the end of it

13:19.860 --> 13:21.940
They have to unite against hornets or something

13:21.940 --> 13:25.540
But at the end of the day bees endangered

13:26.380 --> 13:32.140
Mr. Bean, that's a good point. Mr. Beans, they come and go but we need these little guys these little buzzy boys

13:32.140 --> 13:35.060
I am very very excited to announce that

13:35.920 --> 13:41.460
The the top result for me. I would to see if there's a trailer yet the top result for man versus be

13:42.220 --> 13:49.340
It on YouTube. It's a is it my brother my brother me and a manic by crafty salad. So hey, thank you for that

13:49.340 --> 13:52.680
We got that. Thank you. Should we do the regular show though?

13:53.180 --> 13:58.740
Yeah, I guess I I just we're so close, you know, we're so I can taste it

13:58.740 --> 14:03.520
I will say it's weird that it's a month out and there's still not a single

14:04.580 --> 14:07.180
promotional image or video or anything

14:07.900 --> 14:13.340
Yeah for this thing other than that one incredible poster. That's all you need baby. I

14:13.940 --> 14:15.940
guess that's all you need but

14:15.940 --> 14:21.480
I've been mr. Bean. Let's hear your bean. No, I'll hear it later. Okay

14:24.220 --> 14:30.900
There it is, I when they did NFTs my tweet was my non fungible friend and I don't think

14:32.140 --> 14:34.140
Fucking that's I enjoy that

14:35.060 --> 14:41.100
But it's great. Yeah, that's the thing that's gonna get me going again. I have this question that's been haunting me

14:41.100 --> 14:46.380
Huh for years when I was a kid. I went to a house showing with my parents and during it

14:46.380 --> 14:48.260
I really had to go to the bathroom

14:48.260 --> 14:52.460
So I asked my mom if I could use the bathroom of the place that we were seeing

14:52.460 --> 14:58.300
I don't even remember if I did or if I was allowed but now as an adult who's looking for places to live now

14:58.300 --> 15:01.820
I'm wondering can you use the bathroom at places you're seeing should you?

15:02.700 --> 15:04.700
That's from Nathan. I mean

15:04.700 --> 15:10.700
What what what it's like Nathan what Nathan?

15:11.140 --> 15:13.900
Listen, if you're gonna live in a place

15:15.500 --> 15:20.980
You're gonna make messes in it. Do you know what I mean? Like thank you when you live in a house

15:21.540 --> 15:26.820
What are you gonna do go back to your old house to make messes cuz you know it and know that it's good for you

15:26.820 --> 15:28.820
You gotta take a test drive

15:28.820 --> 15:33.780
Oh, yeah, you can't I'm kidding. Listen. I can't even kid around here

15:33.940 --> 15:40.540
Yeah, you absolutely have to use the bathroom. Yeah, like you have to there are in the house

15:40.780 --> 15:44.340
Right like three things that you're gonna spend them

15:44.340 --> 15:49.180
but like your bedroom where you sleep your kitchen where you make food and your toilet where you make messes and

15:49.300 --> 15:54.780
Like if any one of those three is like you get in there and like oh actually I hate this

15:54.780 --> 16:01.300
I hate this and you don't find that out until after you paid for the house. That's that's the wrong time to read

16:01.300 --> 16:03.220
Cuz maybe you sit down you're like, oh, you know what?

16:03.220 --> 16:06.860
This counter is actually a little close to this. I feel like I'm pinned in here

16:06.860 --> 16:11.780
Oh, you know actually the toilet paper dispensers a little bit too far away and I gotta like lean forward to reach it

16:11.860 --> 16:15.300
What if it's one of those things where this toilet seat won't stay up?

16:15.300 --> 16:21.460
Oh, I like hold it with one hand while you do the your your stand-up business with the other hand

16:21.460 --> 16:26.660
All right. Well, that's why I just don't I don't you stand up. Do y'all remember the first house that we bought?

16:27.380 --> 16:33.700
Where there was a fucking Harry Potter bathroom like Harry Potter under the stairs bathroom

16:33.700 --> 16:33.980
Yeah

16:33.980 --> 16:38.340
that you had to like scooch into and kind of lean backwards cuz the you imagine my

16:38.460 --> 16:43.100
Horror my abject horror after I'd signed a deed to say yes, this is my bathroom

16:43.100 --> 16:49.660
Yeah, and I sat in there and tried to use that bathroom. Can you imagine my abject terror as my knees bump the wall?

16:49.660 --> 16:54.940
Oh, yeah, that was I felt like I was on a American Airlines flight

16:56.940 --> 17:03.580
That was a bad that was a bad situation the first apartment that Teresa and I lived in together and grant we did not buy the

17:03.580 --> 17:05.020
house but

17:05.020 --> 17:07.540
There was one bathroom in the apartment

17:07.540 --> 17:09.940
But then they said but in case if there's like an emergency

17:09.940 --> 17:15.980
You have to use there is a toilet in the basement that toilet while connected and fully functional was just stand like in the middle

17:15.980 --> 17:21.100
Of a room there was no it was like some fucking Frank Lloyd Wright like this is like a desert

17:21.100 --> 17:26.500
There's no walls kind of shit. We're just like if it's an emergency and you gotta go. Yeah, just right there

17:26.500 --> 17:29.180
Do you guys remember the first apartment?

17:29.180 --> 17:36.220
I moved into in Huntington up in the West Virginia building where I didn't realize this like when we signed up for it

17:36.220 --> 17:38.940
but it came it came with dookie man and

17:39.420 --> 17:44.780
Sorry, what when the bathroom you remember? Do you remember the first apartment? I yes. Yes

17:44.780 --> 17:49.660
Yes building. Yeah, and then you were high there once and a talkable. Yeah, that was a good day

17:49.660 --> 17:54.260
Once but then during that visit. Did you go to the bathroom and see dookie man?

17:55.300 --> 18:00.860
No, I don't think so. Oh, you didn't you didn't see him and now that I remember bad news. He saw you. Oh

18:01.500 --> 18:06.660
Really? I can't believe you don't remember dookie, man. He's just he was there always and

18:07.700 --> 18:11.420
He was bad like a guy that lived in your bathroom. Is that you're telling me?

18:11.420 --> 18:16.540
Um guys not though. He had human qualities, I guess. Yeah

18:17.140 --> 18:22.740
But he would he was there. He other people saw him like your roommates on. I don't know if they ever

18:22.740 --> 18:24.060
I know I should send them

18:24.060 --> 18:29.380
I need to reconnect with those boys on Facebook messenger and say like hey fun times we had in that apartment

18:29.700 --> 18:31.700
Too bad about dookie, man

18:32.020 --> 18:35.740
But they never mentioned him. You just assumed that if they saw they were keeping it to themselves

18:36.740 --> 18:38.340
Yeah

18:38.340 --> 18:43.460
Okay, believe you guys don't remember dookie man. No, I was there a lot. I used the bathroom quite a few times

18:43.460 --> 18:48.380
It'd be a lot more fun if you remembered dookie man, and you could help me kind of flesh him out a little bit

18:48.500 --> 18:54.180
Well, I think that the name was off-putting. Yeah. Oh, well that was I mean, he didn't tell me his name

18:54.740 --> 18:58.340
You absolutely need to use the bathroom here. I want to move on. Okay

18:59.180 --> 19:01.820
The wizard has one for us if we are good with that

19:02.980 --> 19:04.980
Sure. Yeah. Yeah

19:04.980 --> 19:08.900
All right. Cool. Yeah, cool Glenn sent this in. Thank you, Glenn

19:08.900 --> 19:15.260
It's this is and this one's like actionable I think for like most folks all the time. Okay

19:15.260 --> 19:21.500
It's how to interpret a dream involving seals. Thank you. And this is first of all, he's singing

19:22.020 --> 19:26.180
Lovely animal. I tried to get ahead of it. Did you hear how I tried to get ahead of it?

19:26.180 --> 19:31.900
Like right away, I'll try to still got in there to scoop it. No, we're talking about the little blubbery boys known as seals

19:32.500 --> 19:34.340
or sea dogs

19:34.340 --> 19:36.340
Dream interpretation can be complicated

19:36.580 --> 19:41.980
Usually the most important meaning of a dream is the meaning that's important to you as an individual. I don't yes

19:41.980 --> 19:46.300
I don't like that. I feel like it should be pretty objective. There should be a chart. There should be a chart

19:46.300 --> 19:49.040
There's really only two dream interpretations, right?

19:49.040 --> 19:55.760
And one it's either you are anxious or you are not anxious and it's one of those two and if you break it down by that

19:55.820 --> 20:01.980
It's pretty easy to see which one's which right? Yeah. Yeah, it's more gradients of how anxious are you right exactly?

20:01.980 --> 20:06.580
That's really it. Either. You're either you're like you're several different degrees of anxious

20:06.580 --> 20:08.900
Yeah, or maybe you get to chill out and fly. Yeah

20:10.020 --> 20:14.700
You had an okay day or you had a normal day

20:16.940 --> 20:19.540
Can I Henry had a nightmare the other day about

20:20.580 --> 20:23.020
Zombies, he's had that one quite a bit lately. Yeah, and

20:23.860 --> 20:30.760
He was like, but I had superpowers. Oh, I was like, oh cool. And he's like nice but the superpowers had to load

20:30.760 --> 20:32.280
Oh

20:32.280 --> 20:35.680
Shit, that's so good. That's so choice

20:36.200 --> 20:38.480
Okay, so record the details write them all down

20:38.480 --> 20:41.700
If you want to interpret the dream, you need to record the details you wait

20:41.700 --> 20:46.040
I'm talking about waking up in a cold sweat and turning on the light and your wife is like, what are you doing?

20:46.040 --> 20:49.600
You know, like I have to I have to write this down. I had a dream and

20:50.780 --> 20:54.520
The lead singer of matchbox 20 was there and he got mad at me. What does it mean?

20:54.520 --> 21:02.320
You're you're anxious today and okay jot down everything you remember track specifics like colors shapes sounds words

21:02.320 --> 21:07.280
And so on they were seal sounds and shapes the shape of a seal the sound of a seal

21:07.280 --> 21:13.960
Do you think it's better or worse if the seal makes seal sounds or if the seal speaks in like human voice?

21:14.320 --> 21:16.480
Hi, thanks for coming. Yeah. Hey, hey

21:17.640 --> 21:23.360
Good. What's up? I know you think this is a dream, but I'm telepathically connecting to you. Could you bring me some fish?

21:23.360 --> 21:24.600
I

21:24.600 --> 21:29.320
Love the aquarium, you know, but nearby if you could just come down. No, don't wake up yet. Say yes

21:29.320 --> 21:34.280
You're a human. You're a human, right? Yeah, where's all the ice land going? Yeah, I used to

21:34.800 --> 21:39.400
Love it there and it's all going away. Is everything okay? I have to assume it's humans

21:39.400 --> 21:41.600
You guys are way more worried about this than us, right?

21:44.120 --> 21:49.800
You guys got to be freaking out doing everything you can to fix this shit, right because like I'm a seal and my seal brain

21:49.800 --> 21:55.400
Comprehends that there's an issue. So you with your human brains you guys got to be like really freaking out

21:55.400 --> 21:59.960
Are you talking to me? Why are you sleeping? You got thumbs and computers and stuff, right and don't be wrong

21:59.960 --> 22:03.000
It's right making the whales go extinct. We love that

22:06.520 --> 22:11.680
I should admit right now the temperatures that's caused by our farts. Yeah, don't tell anybody

22:12.440 --> 22:17.080
But I see you guys every day fighting those big metal animals that spit out all that stuff

22:17.080 --> 22:22.880
You guys killed them yet. You guys seem to be all those fighting. I'm just so awesome. Okay record your feelings

22:22.880 --> 22:27.120
That's the same. I felt like a seal. I saw I saw the seal

22:27.120 --> 22:30.920
It sounded like Rob Thomas from matchbox 20 and I felt sad

22:32.680 --> 22:36.120
A little bit happy because it was Rob Thomas. I'm a big fan. Sure

22:36.120 --> 22:39.840
Sure, sure. The next step is identify your thoughts, which is literally the same thing

22:40.200 --> 22:42.540
No feelings and thoughts are different driven

22:42.540 --> 22:49.900
Okay fan if in the dream you saw a seal and you felt anxious, but you thought oh fuck is that Rob Thomas?

22:49.900 --> 22:54.140
That's right different things, right a band of seals played me matchbox 20s

22:54.140 --> 23:01.440
Unwell, and if I felt sad, but I thought it was badass. Yeah. Yeah two different things pretty badass song

23:01.740 --> 23:05.480
It is really is think about your personal role in the dream

23:05.780 --> 23:10.140
Oftentimes we are not ourselves in our dreams. You may find that you are playing a role. You would not normally play in life

23:10.140 --> 23:14.740
I was like I was the drummer of matchbox 20 and normally I'm the guitarist

23:15.060 --> 23:18.980
For example, you may be aggressive in your dream while you tend to be non confrontational in real life

23:18.980 --> 23:22.860
I'm gonna get you dream seal. I'm gonna get you and fuck you up dream seal

23:23.320 --> 23:25.780
Please don't kill you killed my dad dream seal

23:26.940 --> 23:32.060
Think about how you felt so far. We have not talked about seals in this article. That's the point

23:32.060 --> 23:39.100
I think we have a lot so let's begin that now looking for potential meanings consider the potential symbolism of seals

23:39.100 --> 23:40.460
most

23:40.460 --> 23:42.180
Symbolism and dreams is highly personal

23:42.180 --> 23:48.140
However, no one is completely unaware of culture and the cultural meanings or associations that are often attached to images like seals

23:49.700 --> 23:54.820
Yeah, Justin, why don't you tell me some one thing that seals represent again object not to you

23:55.380 --> 24:00.060
But just sort of archetypically speaking us just like just like um

24:02.620 --> 24:04.620
Tricks yeah

24:05.140 --> 24:07.220
Yeah, that's one thing that I feel like

24:07.220 --> 24:09.220
Yeah, they do a trick with a ball

24:10.860 --> 24:16.220
Sometimes they jump up into passers-by's kayaks and they're like you got to get me the fuck out of here, man

24:16.220 --> 24:18.220
And that's great. We love that

24:18.900 --> 24:21.220
Travis yeah, see what do I think?

24:21.900 --> 24:23.860
What's the seal mean to you?

24:23.860 --> 24:25.060
sperm

24:25.060 --> 24:32.060
Yeah, yeah, sorry sperm cuz they're like slippery wigglers and they're swimming quickly all over the place and I

24:32.060 --> 24:37.100
I think sperm whales eat them and that's a connection in my brain, too. I'm not sure though

24:37.100 --> 24:41.540
Maybe sperm I think if you walk into the daily therapist's office and he's like, so what's up?

24:41.540 --> 24:45.700
You're like I had a dream about seals which of course means sperm. Maybe I okay. We're done for the day

24:45.700 --> 24:51.300
It doesn't mean it doesn't actually say that I'm actually writing you a prescription. I know the exact pill

24:52.100 --> 24:57.580
For you. I know the exact pill that's gonna fix this for you because we've heard this well, what's it mean?

24:57.580 --> 25:01.900
What's this? What's the seal represent to you Griffin? Yeah, well, I've already read the wiki how article

25:01.900 --> 25:03.900
So I'm tainted

25:04.300 --> 25:09.420
See lions would that have been a better answer that they're basically this seal is just short for sea lion

25:09.420 --> 25:14.220
Yeah, there is a certain duality in seals that can be symbolic while seals live in the ocean

25:14.220 --> 25:18.620
They can also come up on land a seal in a dream may suggest confusion regarding one's place in the world

25:18.660 --> 25:23.540
Do you think that when see you sorry author of this article? Do you think when seals go up on land?

25:23.540 --> 25:25.540
They're like what the fuck am I doing?

25:25.540 --> 25:31.620
I'm caught between two worlds. This is stupid. This is stupid. I look at my I have fins

25:31.860 --> 25:35.580
Look at the way I try to walk with my not feet. What the fuck am I doing up here?

25:36.580 --> 25:41.460
They're excellent swimmers able to navigate water a seal in a dream may have something to do with the ability to go with the flow

25:41.460 --> 25:46.980
Of life if you felt overwhelmed recently a seal in a dream can be representative of a longing for more control. That's good

25:47.300 --> 25:50.220
Hey, you guys want to hear something? It's weird and fucked up and true

25:50.320 --> 25:54.580
Yeah, the difference between seals and sea lions is they have ear flaps or not

25:54.580 --> 25:56.140
no

25:56.140 --> 26:00.860
Seal is sure for your line. Say see you Travis. They see you lying outside out loud

26:01.100 --> 26:06.400
See you outside go outside. Okay, hold on and say see you lying out loud, but don't say I am

26:08.740 --> 26:10.740
Okay, yeah, I get it

26:14.060 --> 26:18.940
And if that's not right if you could email us that would be great, but I'm pretty sure that it is right yeah

26:20.340 --> 26:22.340
our email address is

Help at Jimmy John's

26:28.460 --> 26:30.460
Look at your personal struggles

26:34.860 --> 26:36.860
Did not do that podcast

26:38.300 --> 26:42.420
The cost-benefit analysis of I had a seal dream last night

26:42.420 --> 26:47.900
I'm curious what it meant and the Internet is like, well, let's psychoanalyze and you're like, oh wait

26:47.900 --> 26:53.860
Imagine if you woke up and you're like, how's your sleep? I jump with my seals clear my schedule. I'm going deep today

26:54.700 --> 27:00.980
WikiHow told me I need to think about my problems and that's all it took to start me on this journey of self-discovery

27:01.580 --> 27:04.620
Step one. I've been fighting a lot of whales lately. Oh

27:05.140 --> 27:07.140
All done

27:07.740 --> 27:12.500
Think about what's been on your mind lately. Have you been feeling overwhelmed by something at work or a personal relationship?

27:12.500 --> 27:16.620
Have you been struggling to make a big decision? Yeah, maybe the seal can help with that

27:16.620 --> 27:18.180
um

27:18.180 --> 27:19.820
If I'm here to help

27:19.820 --> 27:25.820
Now tell me who's been eating your sandwich and using the copier at all hours. No, it's Sammy. Did you bring those fish?

27:25.820 --> 27:30.620
I asked you for it. You did awesome. No, this is another this she's kind of gossipy at work, huh?

27:30.620 --> 27:34.940
Oh, that's a tough one tough one. Here's another interactive segment

27:34.940 --> 27:38.780
I want both of you to evaluate your personal connection to seals

27:39.260 --> 27:41.500
Have seals ever had a large importance in your life?

27:41.500 --> 27:46.260
Do you have any particularly strong memories of seals? Is this like a scale of one to ten kind of deal?

27:46.260 --> 27:51.340
I would say can I say I'm realizing this is I've tried to make seal jokes. I fucking

27:51.980 --> 27:53.980
Nothing. See. Oh

27:53.980 --> 28:00.380
Nothing them. I if they're at like there's a seal show at the astounding

28:01.420 --> 28:08.060
Nation's best if I may Atlanta aquarium, huh? And I actually might be the Georgia aquarium, but it is in Atlanta

28:08.620 --> 28:11.420
There's a seal show there and it's like right there, right?

28:11.420 --> 28:17.020
Yeah, and you just walk in and see seals doing tricks and I like don't care if I'm there or not

28:17.620 --> 28:22.820
Sometimes I'll walk in there and see the seals. Yeah, sometimes I don't I don't care

28:22.820 --> 28:26.260
I think that that might be a bigger connection of like your

28:26.500 --> 28:32.000
Disinterest in dogs as well because to me seals are a very dog-like aquatic creature because for me

28:32.000 --> 28:37.020
I'm at like an 8.5 on seals. I have feelings solely based around

28:37.020 --> 28:43.740
Tina Majorino's star turn in Andre of course the seal movie where yeah if memory serves

28:43.780 --> 28:46.900
She had a seal friend and that was about the extent of it

28:46.900 --> 28:53.620
I think the seal solved a crime if I'm not mistaken. I think he she tried to pretend the seal was a real person

28:54.220 --> 28:56.220
Mm-hmm

28:56.220 --> 29:00.840
Like a seal and a dog become best friend or it's a dolphin and a dog isn't it? Yeah, that's not

29:00.840 --> 29:08.360
I'm gonna say yeah out of ten. I'm like an 8.5. I feel before you out on seal. I like them

29:08.360 --> 29:10.180
I like them

29:10.180 --> 29:17.320
Listener, please tweet us your feelings on seals. It's at Jimmy John's. I'd love to touch one. Just okay. Yeah

29:18.080 --> 29:19.800
I bet they feel

29:19.800 --> 29:21.800
Super I would like to swim with on

29:21.880 --> 29:24.040
Well, but I'm not a great swimmer

29:24.040 --> 29:31.080
So I also feel like the dog the dog this he'll be very judgmental have to do the whole that old like put a collar around

29:31.080 --> 29:32.600
two of them and

29:32.600 --> 29:37.920
Like what? Yeah that old chestnut. That's cool and not bad for them

29:38.720 --> 29:41.600
Roxanne we should make it clear because some people are gonna be like

29:42.200 --> 29:46.440
That's mean to say but the seals love it when they pull you through the water

29:46.440 --> 29:51.800
They don't know what to do if they're not doing it. Yeah. Yeah, and it makes them like really strong

29:51.800 --> 29:54.520
once you take it off and they're not hauling they're like

29:55.240 --> 29:58.720
If you have two seals that have hauled me for a long time and you and hinge me

29:58.720 --> 30:03.760
They're suddenly like half a Justin faster. Yeah, it's like and that's an amazing feeling they love that

30:03.760 --> 30:06.200
It's not like a bad like SeaWorld thing

30:06.200 --> 30:12.160
It's like a they they prefer it people probably think you're mean to yourself for exercising, right?

30:12.160 --> 30:18.780
You know avoid dream dictionaries and they have a picture of a dream dictionary here, but it's it's backwards

30:18.780 --> 30:21.920
Like the title is on the back cover of the book

30:22.040 --> 30:26.160
So I don't is that because if you look it up you're gonna realize how much horse shit is

30:28.640 --> 30:31.820
Time to put it all together question each image in your dream

30:32.160 --> 30:34.800
Okay, for example, you remember an image from the dream

30:34.800 --> 30:39.520
You are swimming in the ocean with your best friend when a large herd of seals approach the seals surround you and your friend is

30:39.520 --> 30:40.800
Nowhere to be found

30:40.800 --> 30:46.440
Damn, okay. What did they what did the seal is my friend a seal? No. Well, maybe I see you on

30:46.440 --> 30:50.420
Maybe they turned into one, but I'm afraid to be a seal. Oh

30:51.240 --> 30:56.040
Yeah, I'm letting opportunity pass me by opportunity for fun for change

30:57.040 --> 30:59.040
transformation rebirth I just say

30:59.480 --> 31:05.480
That they went with a herd of seals, but there's many terms that they could have gone with that are way better

31:06.040 --> 31:08.280
Yeah, a rookery of seals

31:08.280 --> 31:15.840
Oh a harem of seals which no or a bob of seals a

31:16.520 --> 31:18.900
Bob that's pretty tight. I like that

31:19.760 --> 31:25.480
I would love a hair of mostly. Oh god now if I introduce you to my

31:25.880 --> 31:32.960
Yes, I this is the largest private estate in the nation over here. That's real for the door behind here

31:32.960 --> 31:39.200
I have a harem of so well, I suppose you could say yes married

31:39.840 --> 31:44.680
I don't describe to such a pedestrian labels. It's a harem

31:46.560 --> 31:48.400
Figure out what please

31:48.400 --> 31:54.920
Figure out what the seals mean in your specific dream. Yeah, no shit wiki out. What have we been doing, dude?

31:54.920 --> 31:57.760
This is circular read this article on seal

31:57.760 --> 32:02.400
In dream interpretation, it's like it just keeps going down the spiral

32:02.600 --> 32:08.000
Here's a hyperlink to this article reflect on your feelings again. Thanks. You're wasting my time now

32:08.760 --> 32:15.440
Last step apply the interpretation to your current situation. Is there a word count? They have to hit in this article

32:15.440 --> 32:17.440
It feels like it. Absolutely

32:18.440 --> 32:24.400
Yeah, man, figure it out and then look back over your notes and then do it do it you practice

32:24.400 --> 32:31.440
This is all about practicing mindfulness though because it's you got you can't just look at the dream and be like the seal means that

32:31.440 --> 32:37.120
I am in love with my best friend and I can't and I'm afraid to change you have to

32:37.240 --> 32:42.520
You have to go and go to your best friend be like hey a seal a dream seal told me I'm in love with you

32:42.520 --> 32:48.500
You have to be ready. We need to take some fish down to the aquarium if you have time and a big and a knife

32:49.040 --> 32:50.880
One of them wanted a knife

32:50.880 --> 32:56.920
My strategy I think is gonna be to figure out what the problem is and then try to fix the problem very hard for one

32:56.920 --> 33:01.680
Week. Yeah, and then less hard for two. Uh-huh, and then stop completely after that

33:01.680 --> 33:07.440
Yeah, I think my strategy is gonna be to stop watching movies about seals before I go to bed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's huge

33:07.440 --> 33:09.440
I watch Andre every night. Yeah

33:10.280 --> 33:13.120
Cuz it's it's so fucking funny and cute

33:13.960 --> 33:18.960
You could watch a dolphin tail starring Harry Cronk Jr. And see if that changes anything. Sure

33:18.960 --> 33:20.960
There's a lot of great movies you could watch

33:21.240 --> 33:24.040
Fish you could watch fish tales is another one

33:24.640 --> 33:31.840
Free Willy one through I don't know like six. Yeah, mr. The free Willy cartoon. There's a cyborg. Really?

33:32.560 --> 33:34.560
limp it

33:36.180 --> 33:41.640
Name one more fish movie Griffin my dinner with Andre is a sequel to Andre. Yeah

33:42.120 --> 33:44.120
Where Wallace Shawn?

33:44.120 --> 33:48.640
Goes to dinner with a seal and the whole time he's like, why are you being so rude?

33:49.640 --> 33:51.760
That was my celebrity impression for the episode

33:51.760 --> 33:56.880
I don't have to do one at the end is that is my dinner with Andre the seal a comedy Griffin or is it played?

33:56.880 --> 34:01.500
Straight, it's it's like a Linklater film. Oh, like they talk they talk about like

34:02.040 --> 34:04.880
God and stuff. Oh, wow. Okay. Yeah

34:05.400 --> 34:07.400
Not like a Dunstan checks in

34:07.400 --> 34:14.160
Well it there is in some deleted scenes some parts where Dunstan talks about God and his Dunstan, okay

34:14.280 --> 34:18.340
Dunstan doesn't appear in my dinner with Andre the seal though. No, no, no, no, that's a

34:18.900 --> 34:22.460
Animal movie that is and that is the dumbest thing you've ever said

34:23.240 --> 34:25.240
Yeah

34:25.720 --> 34:28.360

Let me ask you guys a question when you heard the Bears hi Renee

36:11.600 --> 36:16.200
Did you always think when you're a kid that they like went to sleep and then they slept?

36:16.480 --> 36:22.180
For like four months and then woke up. Is that not what they do? That is not of Travis

36:22.320 --> 36:28.160
Okay, listen. All right. Listen, stop the ad. I didn't realize that

36:28.880 --> 36:32.000
Not true. They're basically just kind of they sleep a lot

36:32.040 --> 36:37.320
They don't do much but they're not just like in a sleep coma for four months. In fact

36:37.320 --> 36:41.880
Uh, like during hibernation is when bears like give birth and shit

36:42.320 --> 36:46.280
You're kidding. Oh, not just asleep. They're not just sleeping for like four months

36:46.280 --> 36:50.680
Why did I think they would sleep for because I'm pretty sure that's what we were told them. We were kids

36:50.680 --> 36:54.560
I feel like you were taught that a lot when you're a kid, but that's apparently not

36:55.520 --> 36:59.640
They're just kind of like dozing a lot and not sure. Yeah, man

37:00.600 --> 37:05.720

Have another all right

39:57.480 --> 40:03.360
I'm a nanny for a couple of young child. My shift starts at 11 in the morning and ends shortly before dinner. I

40:04.200 --> 40:08.600
Always eat an early lunch before this even though the parents remind me often

40:08.600 --> 40:12.280
I'm welcome to any the food in the fridge or cabinets while I'm working. They're clearly worried

40:12.280 --> 40:13.800
I don't feel comfortable enough in their home to eat

40:13.800 --> 40:17.640
The real reason is that most of the food in their house is completely unappetizing to me

40:17.640 --> 40:19.240
I simply bring my own stuff

40:19.240 --> 40:25.400
Is there a polite way to signal them? They've made me feel perfectly welcome and just think their food looks kind of gross

40:25.400 --> 40:27.400
That's from picky eater in Portland

40:27.720 --> 40:34.420
Wow, so judgmental. Maybe you got I have a friend. He's a tiger. His name's Daniel. You know

40:34.420 --> 40:42.060
I try new food because it might be good. Yeah, it was rhetorical, but he says you got to try new foods because they might taste good

40:42.900 --> 40:48.140
We like whoa Jesus Christ. All right, we all guys that was jarring

40:48.140 --> 40:54.780
I you should have heard that on my end was it wait till you hear that play play that back on your holy shit

40:54.780 --> 40:59.100
I that tripped me out for a second little blood army there wows. Yeah

40:59.100 --> 41:06.420
I was do your Daniel Tiger joke. Don't do mine. Okay, we like different things and that's just fine

41:06.420 --> 41:08.420
But remember to be kind

41:08.740 --> 41:13.420
Well, he also says if you have to go potty stop and go right away and that is really close-minded

41:13.620 --> 41:19.660
Daniel Tiger if I I have tried to live a life and create a career for myself that does

41:20.520 --> 41:25.100
Allow for that. Yeah. Yeah, that does allow me to go. I have to go potty even a little bit

41:25.100 --> 41:29.540
So I'm going to stop what I'm doing right now, but sometimes you're on stage in front of a big screaming crowd

41:29.700 --> 41:31.820
Yeah, and it doesn't work like that Daniel Tiger

41:31.820 --> 41:37.940
Well to be fair the earlier version of that was we should live in a society where when one has to go potty

41:38.060 --> 41:43.260
They should be able to stop and go right away with no judgment. We're like this is a little ideal

41:43.260 --> 41:46.500
Yeah, they had to shorten that a little bit. Yeah, there's a song

41:46.500 --> 41:51.860
It's like abolish work so we can go potty whenever we need to yeah, that's a good one

41:51.860 --> 41:56.820
Give the businesses to the workers, right? You could get a

41:57.500 --> 42:01.900
Cutting board and dip a knife in some hummus and then leave the knife on the game board

42:02.620 --> 42:07.740
And then your desk job. Oh, I see what you're saying. This is to make it seem like you ate some of the food

42:07.740 --> 42:11.860
Yeah, you didn't eat anything, but you like yeah, I'm real comfortable here. I didn't clean up after myself

42:13.340 --> 42:15.340
Now here's the thing we are all

42:15.860 --> 42:20.860
children have our people and so really be a better really should and

42:20.860 --> 42:25.780
We have from time to time had people watch our children, and I've done the line complete

42:25.780 --> 42:29.020
You know you're you can eat here, but whenever I do that

42:29.020 --> 42:32.700
I also think in the back of my head, but I did like pick out all this food because I wanted

42:33.740 --> 42:38.860
But but you should know that I have a sort of mental catalog of exactly how much I have of all these things

42:38.860 --> 42:43.260
And if there's less or none of the things that I think I have I will actually lose

42:43.260 --> 42:46.100
I'm gonna tell you like whatever you want, but in my head

42:46.100 --> 42:48.540
There are things that are like mine like that bag of M&Ms

42:48.540 --> 42:54.020
That's mine and like if you eat that I'll be pissed not enough to not hire you again. Don't get it twisted

42:54.020 --> 42:55.700
I like that you watch my kid, and I trust you

42:55.700 --> 42:59.700
But if you eat that bag of M&Ms that I did not tell you not to eat

43:00.540 --> 43:05.500
I'm gonna yeah like one degree like you us if if you drink my last Pepsi

43:05.740 --> 43:12.680
You enjoy looking at the inside of my home because it will be the last time oh boy. Oh boy. Oh you ate the doughnuts, okay?

43:13.380 --> 43:16.620
Yeah, although I will say when I was a babysitter when I used to babysit

43:16.620 --> 43:21.840
Oh, oh boy. There's nothing more delicious than like oh shit. You guys have

43:23.180 --> 43:25.180
We never have put it in our house

43:25.540 --> 43:30.820
When I was babysitting I had a lot of secret bathroom gushers because I knew they weren't for me

43:30.820 --> 43:33.140
And I could not let the children see me eat them

43:33.180 --> 43:36.940
So I would sort of take them and go into the bathroom and eat like five at a time

43:37.180 --> 43:37.700
Yeah

43:37.700 --> 43:41.500
Finish a pack and like man you would not believe how fast I could polish off a pack of gushers

43:41.500 --> 43:44.940
And I'm pretty sure that's not the first time I've said that sentence on this show

43:44.940 --> 43:46.940
Is

43:49.900 --> 43:51.900
There a way to say to them oh

43:52.540 --> 43:59.460
I do feel comfortable here. It's just that your food is yucky without it being a thing like oh, no

43:59.460 --> 44:05.460
Thank you. Why are you rephrasing the question because I'm trying to think if there's a way if you could say

44:06.580 --> 44:12.900
Hmm. Oh, you know what actually on Tuesdays. I only eat turkey sandwiches cuz it starts with a T

44:12.900 --> 44:15.820
Just like Tuesdays. Sorry. It's bug day. Huh?

44:16.620 --> 44:19.620
That's not what I said, but I like yours only bugs for me

But it's a choice that I made for myself to make a more sustainable choice for yeah

44:41.900 --> 44:44.460
Henry Cavill did it to get ready for man

44:45.580 --> 44:48.840
He actually got really cup, but that's not that's not that's point of it

44:48.840 --> 44:50.840
Even though he did look so good in the Nola home

44:53.020 --> 44:57.420
You may not have noticed this they had to CG a lot of his face stuff in the Superman movie

44:57.420 --> 45:01.380
Yeah, because he but he was living a very poomba lifestyle at the time

45:01.380 --> 45:03.660
So they had to like get the tusks out of the picture

45:03.660 --> 45:08.500

Because it is a bug day for me

45:32.700 --> 45:37.660
Tomorrow, I'm gonna find a baby and race. It's my own. It's a whole lifestyle. It's not just the food thing

45:37.660 --> 45:40.660
I am looking for a meerkat partner

45:40.660 --> 45:45.220
So if you know any meers and you actually are you I know you have a lot of questions

45:45.220 --> 45:47.260
You cannot ask them. You can't

45:48.060 --> 45:52.380
Is what I'll say every time if you ask do you think do you think?

45:52.940 --> 45:59.900
That way after many years when Simba was was traveling around with Timon and poomba. Do you think?

46:01.140 --> 46:06.060
That it there was ever a moment where he like wandered away to the two of them and here they ran into like a goose

46:06.060 --> 46:10.100
Or something and it goes like who's that over there? And Simba's like, oh, those are my dad's

46:11.500 --> 46:13.500
Goals Justin those

46:15.180 --> 46:22.340
Are not Simba's dad's Justin they're his uncle my dumb not bug eating real death fell and died

46:24.860 --> 46:26.860
Do you think he ever slipped up he's like

46:26.860 --> 46:35.060
Like poop alike handed him a bug and he's like, thanks. Oh, yeah, and there's like silence like what did you say? Oh,

46:36.380 --> 46:41.760
Okay, this is okay. I'm gonna need to walk away for a second. I do think it's nice that

46:42.380 --> 46:47.340
That that married couple Timon and poomba adopted a lion child. I think that that is nice

46:47.940 --> 46:53.300
But do you think there was ever a moment where you know when he's the full-grown adult and he's back there at the pride

46:53.300 --> 46:57.940
Lance he would hunt and kill because he is a lion. That's what he do and he would come home

46:57.940 --> 47:01.980
Just like his face dripping in blood and gore. Yeah, and Timon and poomba was like, oh, right

47:01.980 --> 47:03.260
Oh, all right

47:03.260 --> 47:09.900
He's a terrifying lion that we have really kind of like hitched our wagon to they don't like to hunt and kill

47:09.900 --> 47:17.580
They don't show day after he deposes the bad uncle and he's like, what's up? Everybody? I'm King now. Guess what bugs?

47:17.580 --> 47:22.620

47:34.860 --> 47:38.940
Oh, okay leaves sleeves are alive to only bugs bugs are already dead. I

47:38.940 --> 47:48.700
And the bugs are like, oh, excuse me. I mean not so fast. Um, then then and then and then okay

48:26.860 --> 48:32.340
The undead drivers will remind attendees to grab pizza now and enter one of nine NFTs

All of which will come with a free year of pizza. It seems like an AI wrote that sentence

48:38.020 --> 48:43.440

50:29.100 --> 50:33.940
I can't have you ever heard of such a fucking thing and they spell it WRA

50:33.940 --> 50:41.060
r-a-p-t-o-r like at least have the strength of your convictions around right? Yeah, is it it's not a wrap

50:41.140 --> 50:43.140

50:47.060 --> 50:49.060
amber bbq sauce

Homage to the iconic Jurassic World amber resin. Oh, okay. Yeah, but is the is it amber colored?

50:58.580 --> 51:00.580
Amber is the flavor of my bbq

51:00.580 --> 51:03.300
I think world is such an iconic

51:03.900 --> 51:11.340
Franchise just like our menus that we wanted to make sure we were doing the film's justice and put a lot of inspiration from them

51:11.340 --> 51:13.900
We're making it. It doesn't feel like you are

51:14.500 --> 51:18.180
It doesn't seem like it Owen Klein the VP of culinary

51:18.940 --> 51:25.940
Innovation the culinary team has had a lot of fun with this and when consumers bite into these big meaty items

51:26.060 --> 51:28.060
We want them to be instantly

51:28.060 --> 51:31.980
Transported to the world of Jurassic. No, that's the sentence

51:31.980 --> 51:36.820
That's all it says we want them to be instantly transported to the world of Jurassic the world of Jurassic

51:36.820 --> 51:40.180
Oh, hey Owen. Have you seen any of the movies?

51:40.700 --> 51:45.420
Cuz that they don't call it that they're not like welcome to the park of Jurassic or well

51:45.420 --> 51:51.720
The one that's not Owen. I don't think that people are reading these or writing them

51:51.720 --> 51:57.580
Oh Griffin joked about AI but like listen to this to build excitement leading up to the film's release

51:57.580 --> 52:05.060
CKE is bringing the movie to life by turning to Carl's juniors and Hardy locations into the biggest

52:05.500 --> 52:08.460
dinosaur bite magnet the world has ever seen

52:08.780 --> 52:14.500
By I like every dinosaur saw it. They could not help but bite it. Is that what we are too?

52:15.260 --> 52:18.420
I think that Richard Schiff is kind of a dinosaur bite magnet

52:18.420 --> 52:23.460
well, yeah, the Jurassic World dino takeovers in Los Angeles and

52:23.980 --> 52:26.500
Nashville will feel those two almost

52:26.500 --> 52:33.380
if they will feel as if they could almost be part of the movie itself there may even be a

52:33.860 --> 52:36.420
Jurassic t-rex at the Los Angeles

52:36.980 --> 52:39.960
Which do not he says to me someone's like

52:49.100 --> 52:49.400
Okay

52:49.400 --> 52:54.880
But he said if I was a good boy should fans should go at their own risk because this summer

52:54.880 --> 53:00.120
Carl's Jr. And Hardy's restaurants are the most thrilling places to go then I'm not gonna go

Getting whimsical with things that direct like two-ton moving vehicles around the world would love that if

54:06.640 --> 54:08.880
Just like oh you need to get the hospital

54:08.880 --> 54:09.680

Just turn left at the Hardee's and then three more lefts and then park at Hardy's and eat something and then we'll get you there

55:14.280 --> 55:17.040
It's so cool. I don't know what any of it is

55:17.320 --> 55:22.140
It's starting to feel a little bit like when someone's writing a long report to hand into a teacher and they're pretty sure

55:22.360 --> 55:28.000
The teachers not gonna read every word of every report and so they just start kind of saying things in the middle

The day it is going to give me

57:10.280 --> 57:17.280
Yeah, there's also I noticed no, and they really leaned into this vegetables present on here

57:17.800 --> 57:24.400

57:24.400 --> 57:28.880
Ingredients in the mouth-watering primal angus thickburger. Yeah

57:30.200 --> 57:35.200
But it's not vegetables definitely not there there is an onion slice in there

No, I think that's onion rings Justin. That's a slice of onion deep-fried sure

57:40.440 --> 57:45.920
But I would not say that hundred percent a black angus beef patty char-broiled

57:46.480 --> 57:53.960
Over an open I guess and topped with tender slow-cooked sliced prime rib tangy amber BBQ sauce

57:53.960 --> 57:57.400
Smoked cheddar and onion rings served on a toasted potato bun

57:57.400 --> 58:01.480
