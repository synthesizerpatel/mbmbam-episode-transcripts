00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.120
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.120 --> 00:44.560
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say hey I wanna, just say hey I wanna.

00:44.560 --> 00:49.440
Frankenstein was the first in line, Wolfman came up next.

00:50.240 --> 00:55.120
Dracula wasn't doing his stuff, breathing down my neck.

00:55.120 --> 01:00.880
Jump back, make tracks, here comes a hunchback, better get out of his way.

01:01.920 --> 01:06.480
Fee-fee-fie-fie-fo-fo-fum, it was a monster's holiday.

01:07.040 --> 01:14.400
Hey folks, welcome to part three of our Halloween 2018 celebration. The prices-

01:15.120 --> 01:18.160
Skullabration. Justin, can I- Skullabration.

01:18.160 --> 01:22.800
Well see, I said celebration because we slashed prices on all the late model Fords

01:22.800 --> 01:28.480
that we've got cluttering up our showroom floor. We gotta make room for the 2020s people.

01:28.480 --> 01:33.600
The 2020s are coming in. We got Ford Cadillacs, we got Ford Priuses,

01:33.600 --> 01:40.640
we got Ford Lincolns, we got all the Fords. We got the new Ford Prius, it runs on hate.

01:41.760 --> 01:47.840
That one's coming in at 36 large, you can walk out of the showroom in it for $34,

01:48.560 --> 01:51.840
and then that one's yours, you're gonna drive that puppy home today.

01:51.840 --> 01:58.480
Bad credit, no credit, reverse credit. My credit, your credit.

01:58.480 --> 02:04.000
Oh shit, we owe you money, oh damn. With prices so low, it's scary.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.480
Please come in and let us settle our debts with you.

02:07.040 --> 02:09.120
Please. Please, we owe you a car.

02:09.120 --> 02:14.640
We feel so guilty. That time when you saved our life, we owe you this car, please.

02:14.640 --> 02:19.520
Hey, come on in, we just refilled the soda machine and now we got hot dogs.

02:19.520 --> 02:22.880
Please, come in, we froze Griffin in a block of ice so that you would come look at him.

02:22.880 --> 02:27.120
Oh, I'm frozen, let me out. They didn't add a pee hole.

02:27.120 --> 02:29.840
Oh no. It's just filling up.

02:29.840 --> 02:32.800
You gotta say your fucking name in the name of the show, I am in hell.

02:32.800 --> 02:38.640
My name is Justin McElroy and I'm the oldest broooother.

02:38.640 --> 02:42.320
Okay. My name is Travis McElroy,

02:42.320 --> 02:45.920
and I am the middlest broother. Come up with your own thing.

02:45.920 --> 02:49.920
Well, you didn't really come up with your own thing, so.

02:49.920 --> 02:54.880
I'm your youngest broother and 30 big skeletons, Griffin McElroy.

02:54.880 --> 02:59.360
30 big skeletons sitting on each other's shoulders and driving a late model Honda

02:59.360 --> 03:01.200
that's gotta get out of this showroom.

03:02.240 --> 03:06.560
We are out of room between all the skeletons and these late model Hondas and Fords

03:06.560 --> 03:09.680
and Ford Hondas. We need you to come take some of them

03:09.680 --> 03:12.880
because they're in the bathroom and we haven't been able to use the bathroom for weeks.

03:12.880 --> 03:17.200
Folks, if you don't come by these cars, these 30 tiny skeletons sitting on each other's shoulders

03:17.200 --> 03:19.920
dressed in a trench coat are gonna come take them all.

03:19.920 --> 03:23.360
And I, I hate it. I hate it when they're around.

03:23.360 --> 03:28.000
We don't know how to drive, but we'll gone in 60 seconds your ass and your full family's ass.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.640
Yes, please, please come. And listen, we'll give you the money directly.

03:32.640 --> 03:35.120
No need to go through a blood bank.

03:35.920 --> 03:36.400
All right.

03:37.200 --> 03:38.640
Okay, well, anyway-

03:38.640 --> 03:40.640
I think that was a 30 second radio spot.

03:40.640 --> 03:43.440
And this is also an advice show for the modern era.

03:45.200 --> 03:48.640
We're pumping, we're pumping them full of gas before you take them up a lot.

03:48.640 --> 03:50.880
We're pumping them full of gas.

03:50.880 --> 03:52.000
That's really good.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.040
Do you think people are confused because when they're listening to this, it is November 5th.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.960
Yeah. So you do want to vote tomorrow, but we, we figure a lot of people,

04:02.960 --> 04:05.840
a lot of famous people that you trust are telling you to do that.

04:05.840 --> 04:07.440
And you should obviously do that.

04:07.440 --> 04:10.560
And Future Us is probably telling you to do that as well.

04:10.560 --> 04:13.040
But Past Us, it's the 31st.

04:13.040 --> 04:16.560
And we're just trying to fucking kick it for like a second.

04:16.560 --> 04:19.440
If you could just let us kick it.

04:19.440 --> 04:23.840
Fucking people talk about Christmas for weeks and weeks and weeks.

04:23.840 --> 04:24.160
Sure.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.360
Before and after.

04:25.360 --> 04:26.560
Not after though, Trav.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.400
To be fair, not after usually.

04:28.400 --> 04:31.120
You don't normally hear people mid January like,

04:31.120 --> 04:35.520
damn, I love Jesus and his birthday and Santa and all his miracles.

04:35.520 --> 04:39.520
I feel like there is a window between the 25th and the 1st

04:39.520 --> 04:44.000
where you can still have some remnant Christmas.

04:44.000 --> 04:44.880
The week between.

04:45.440 --> 04:46.400
Yes, of course.

04:46.400 --> 04:47.680
The dead zone.

04:47.680 --> 04:48.320
Yes.

04:48.320 --> 04:52.240
And we are, we have as many late model Fords and Hondas as we need.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.480
Excepting no trade-ins.

04:54.480 --> 04:54.880
No trade-ins.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.400
There's one Mazda on the lot.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.080
If you find the Mazda, it's yours.

04:59.520 --> 05:04.000
Please, if you find a red sports car with a giant grill that looks like a mouth,

05:04.000 --> 05:07.680
that is a teenager that we are waiting to cool off.

05:07.680 --> 05:09.920
So he will transform back.

05:09.920 --> 05:12.240
Please don't buy this turbo teen.

05:13.120 --> 05:17.360
We are getting so late in the year to make our turbo teen reference for 2018.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.800
Thank God we got there.

05:18.800 --> 05:20.960
When the turbo teen transforms back,

05:20.960 --> 05:24.080
we always focus on the one transformation into the car.

05:24.080 --> 05:29.360
If there's someone driving the turbo teen when he transforms back,

05:30.000 --> 05:33.680
does the turbo teen just absorb them or does he-

05:33.680 --> 05:35.280
The word is digest, Griffin.

05:35.280 --> 05:35.840
The word is digest.

05:35.840 --> 05:36.880
When a human being-

05:36.880 --> 05:41.440
Well, or is it just like he's like standing in human form,

05:41.440 --> 05:44.720
but he has like two sets of every appendage?

05:44.720 --> 05:45.520
Do you know what I mean?

05:45.520 --> 05:48.480
A real Zayfod Bebebrock situation.

05:48.480 --> 05:50.640
As he transformed back at the end,

05:50.640 --> 05:53.120
you're just left with like your finger in his mouth.

05:54.400 --> 05:58.240
Yeah, so then it's just like awkward, but it's fine.

05:58.240 --> 06:01.600
But if his finger is spicy, if he just ate some Flamin' Hot Cheetos,

06:01.600 --> 06:03.200
here I go again on my own.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.880
And then you're back in and driving.

06:04.880 --> 06:07.120
That's actually the only way to get into boy cars.

06:07.920 --> 06:08.720
That's the keys.

06:08.720 --> 06:11.680
If you're taking a long road trip with your friend turbo teen,

06:11.680 --> 06:16.640
you just have to keep sticking your spicy finger into his mouth every 20 minutes.

06:16.640 --> 06:17.280
It's miserable.

06:17.280 --> 06:21.040
Are there times when turbo teen regains consciousness

06:21.040 --> 06:24.560
and he's naked on a highway with oncoming traffic coming at him

06:24.560 --> 06:26.480
because he didn't get spicy foods?

06:26.480 --> 06:26.800
Yes.

06:26.800 --> 06:27.040
Yeah.

06:28.480 --> 06:32.080
If turbo teen car gets in a crash and transforms back into human,

06:32.080 --> 06:32.800
what's he look like?

06:32.800 --> 06:33.840
Is he all messed up?

06:33.840 --> 06:34.960
Does he get all jacked up?

06:35.600 --> 06:39.120
If he like has a bladder infection and it burns when he pees,

06:39.120 --> 06:41.840
does he turn into a turbo car?

06:41.840 --> 06:44.160
I don't remember any of this show,

06:44.160 --> 06:48.240
but I do wonder what kind of mysteries or adventures they were having

06:48.240 --> 06:53.600
since like a bunch of teens and their one friend who's a car sometimes

06:53.600 --> 06:56.800
are equally as like threatening as a bunch of teens,

06:56.800 --> 06:59.440
one of whom is rich enough to own a car.

07:00.160 --> 07:03.760
That's basically their superpower is they know how to get a car.

07:03.760 --> 07:04.800
For a second.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.440
The only superpower I can imagine turbo teen having

07:07.440 --> 07:09.600
is like one of the bad guys lifts him up

07:09.600 --> 07:11.840
and while he is above the bad guy's head,

07:11.840 --> 07:12.880
he eats a pepper.

07:12.880 --> 07:14.160
He eats a buffalo tender.

07:14.160 --> 07:14.640
Squish.

07:16.080 --> 07:17.360
Crushes him.

07:17.360 --> 07:18.320
Squish.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.480
This is gonna freak you guys out.

07:20.480 --> 07:21.120
Okay.

07:21.120 --> 07:27.280
Do you know that there were exactly and only 13 episodes of turbo teen ever made?

07:27.280 --> 07:27.920
Really?

07:27.920 --> 07:30.080
We have probably talked more about turbo teen

07:30.080 --> 07:32.560
than it would take you to watch the entirety of-

07:32.560 --> 07:35.280
The entire duration of the program.

07:35.280 --> 07:39.600
From September 8th, 1984 to December 1st, 1984.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.360
And that's it, folks.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.400
That's the ball game.

07:42.400 --> 07:44.480
That's all you got of turbo teen,

07:44.480 --> 07:50.640
which will be, let me run the math, 35 years old.

07:50.640 --> 07:52.320
Damn, it's older than me.

07:52.320 --> 07:53.120
Now, hold on.

07:53.120 --> 07:54.240
You said 84?

07:55.280 --> 07:58.960
So I was only about a year old.

07:58.960 --> 08:02.240
Griffin was still two years away from being born.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.760
How do I know about this show?

08:03.760 --> 08:06.480
Just from you telling me about it when you were four, Justin?

08:07.600 --> 08:08.960
I guess I was just wild about it

08:08.960 --> 08:11.840
and telling this baby that lives in my house

08:11.840 --> 08:15.280
about the car that can transform into a person, I guess.

08:15.280 --> 08:19.600
I got a reboot and it's about a grandpa

08:19.600 --> 08:22.640
that whenever he eats sour food,

08:22.640 --> 08:24.400
turns into a helicopter.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.360
Oh, that's pretty good.

08:27.120 --> 08:28.880
Can I please, please let me tie this?

08:28.880 --> 08:29.920
It's called Chapa Papa.

08:29.920 --> 08:35.840
Chapa Papa, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.320
Oh boy, that's very good.

08:38.320 --> 08:39.360
Or Sky Grandpa.

08:40.800 --> 08:43.360
The Sky Grandpa sounds like when you've retranslated it

08:43.360 --> 08:44.640
back from the Japanese title.

08:44.640 --> 08:46.960
Overseas, it will be known as Sky Grandpa,

08:46.960 --> 08:48.480
but here, Chapa Papa.

08:48.480 --> 08:50.400
What if we did a crossover event?

08:50.400 --> 08:54.160
We set the reboot in the world of Pixar's Cars

08:54.160 --> 08:58.560
and this will be like whenever Mater eats some cold food,

08:58.560 --> 09:00.400
he turns into a man.

09:00.400 --> 09:01.680
Oh, I would love to see that.

09:01.680 --> 09:03.760
I would love to see what just a human looks like

09:03.760 --> 09:04.560
in that world.

09:05.680 --> 09:06.640
Should we do advice?

09:06.640 --> 09:08.160
Because it's been almost 10 minutes now.

09:08.160 --> 09:09.680
I'm starting to get a little antsy

09:09.680 --> 09:11.920
that it's going to be one of those episodes.

09:11.920 --> 09:14.880
My boss and I were working on a project on my computer

09:14.880 --> 09:16.560
and she asked me to bookmark a link

09:17.200 --> 09:20.880
probably for murder.com or ghost.org or something spooky.

09:20.880 --> 09:22.000
Something like that.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.040
Haunted.pizza.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.240
Haunted.pizza.

09:24.240 --> 09:25.840
Hey, oh, hold on real quick.

09:25.840 --> 09:28.720
Sorry, stop the podcast.

09:28.720 --> 09:30.160
Jesus Christ.

09:30.160 --> 09:31.120
Hey, Griffin.

09:31.120 --> 09:32.160
Hey, Griffin.

09:32.160 --> 09:33.360
Can you stop the podcast?

09:33.920 --> 09:34.800
Yeah, I'll pause it.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.200
Go ahead and everybody stop your podcasts, please.

09:37.200 --> 09:40.240
And that is, yeah.

09:40.240 --> 09:41.520
Okay, folks, $38.

09:42.480 --> 09:44.240
I don't mind if I do.

09:44.240 --> 09:46.160
Haunted.pizza is your home.

09:46.160 --> 09:46.960
We got it.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.240
We got it, folks.

09:48.240 --> 09:49.200
Everybody relax.

09:49.840 --> 09:52.800
Haunted.pizza is your home for the latest and greatest

09:52.800 --> 09:55.680
in podcasting.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.760
Okay, so I got Haunted.pizza.

09:57.760 --> 09:58.320
Let's move on.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.640
How do you do that so fucking fast?

10:00.640 --> 10:02.000
That was not edited.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.080
Justin really did that that fast.

10:04.080 --> 10:04.720
It's wild.

10:04.720 --> 10:06.560
Do you just keep it open when we record?

10:06.560 --> 10:10.240
Do you just have like the cursor over the box to enter in?

10:10.240 --> 10:17.440
I'm just always logged into our domain host and I know the

10:17.440 --> 10:19.840
interface like the back of my hand at this point.

10:19.840 --> 10:21.040
Yeah, at this point, I would say.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.760
How's that domain host?

10:23.760 --> 10:26.400
Do they call you now and like, hey, are you okay?

10:26.400 --> 10:27.440
We're worried about you.

10:27.440 --> 10:29.520
No, they're like, you're going to be rich someday when teen

10:29.520 --> 10:30.640
Google pays off.

10:30.640 --> 10:31.440
I'm like, yeah, I know.

10:32.400 --> 10:35.600
At what point did the bank stop calling you for fraud alerts?

10:37.200 --> 10:41.520
Right around this time that I sold them, pressx2jason.com to

10:41.520 --> 10:42.880
redirect to Fifth Third.

10:43.600 --> 10:49.360
Anyway, okay, so boss working on project computer bookmark

10:49.360 --> 10:51.520
link, when I did the computer gave me the option to put the

10:51.520 --> 10:54.080
bookmark in one of the bookmark folders that I have set up.

10:54.080 --> 10:56.320
The first folder on my list is labeled meats.

10:57.600 --> 11:01.600
My boss saw the name of the folder and said meats, M-E-A-T-S,

11:01.600 --> 11:03.040
by the way, and then chuckled.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.920
I didn't think anything of it because the folder was full of

11:06.800 --> 11:10.960
links about different game meat vendors that I had been

11:10.960 --> 11:12.960
researching for Christmas present.

11:12.960 --> 11:15.200
After a few minutes, I realized that my boss likely thought

11:15.200 --> 11:20.160
that my meats folder was a cheekily named folder where I

11:20.160 --> 11:21.920
keep all my porn links.

11:21.920 --> 11:24.240
By then, enough time had passed, I couldn't backtrack and

11:24.240 --> 11:26.160
explain the name of the folder without looking like I was

11:26.160 --> 11:29.520
trying to cover up having a folder of porn links.

11:29.520 --> 11:33.120
So brothers, what's the best way to casually convey to my

11:33.120 --> 11:35.840
boss that I don't have a folder of porn on my work computer

11:36.880 --> 11:41.040
without making it seem like he thinks he doth protest too

11:41.040 --> 11:42.000
much situation?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.640
And that's from Not A Dirty Bird in Brooklyn.

11:44.640 --> 11:52.400
All right, I mean, you can't fix this.

11:52.400 --> 11:55.440
You cannot fix this because you could say like, no, no, no,

11:55.440 --> 11:58.240
come back here and look in my game meats folder.

11:58.240 --> 11:59.520
You're going to love it.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.520
I have so many venisons and they're just going to think

12:01.520 --> 12:05.440
that you fucking changed it since they were last there.

12:05.440 --> 12:08.720
It is because that is a really wild sort of...

12:08.720 --> 12:14.160
Usually I don't take it on this tack with our listeners,

12:14.160 --> 12:15.680
but I think you're lying.

12:15.680 --> 12:21.520
I do think you have pornography in there and then now you're

12:21.520 --> 12:24.400
like protesting too much that you like had to email the

12:24.400 --> 12:27.280
entire universe by way of our show about it.

12:27.280 --> 12:33.520
Man, this is tough.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.560
This is something that other people can learn from.

12:36.560 --> 12:38.880
You shouldn't overthink things.

12:39.840 --> 12:45.120
You should just sort of say whatever the obvious thing

12:45.120 --> 12:46.480
is sometimes, you know?

12:46.480 --> 12:47.600
You don't have to overthink it.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.320
Sometimes if somebody questions something, you shouldn't

12:50.320 --> 12:54.720
get too lost in the pros and cons, the whys and wherefores

12:54.720 --> 12:55.440
and whatnot.

12:55.440 --> 12:58.640
Just say, I'm going to buy meat for Chris's.

12:59.520 --> 13:01.120
And do say that specifically.

13:01.120 --> 13:06.160
Don't say, I'm shopping for Christmas presents for you

13:06.160 --> 13:08.000
so I can't tell you about it.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.280
Because that does seem non legit.

13:11.920 --> 13:12.160
Yeah.

13:14.160 --> 13:17.600
Hey, why are you bookmarking a bunch of meat for a present?

13:18.640 --> 13:21.200
I've never worked this hard for a present in my entire life.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.600
How many different options are you looking at that you

13:23.600 --> 13:25.360
can't keep track of them in your head?

13:26.320 --> 13:27.680
Yeah, that's wild.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.280
I don't believe you.

13:29.920 --> 13:30.720
Yeah, it's not true.

13:30.720 --> 13:31.680
It's a falsehood.

13:32.240 --> 13:33.680
I kind of was thinking about it.

13:33.680 --> 13:37.040
I was trying to give you a bit of the doubt with just, I

13:37.040 --> 13:39.520
don't believe you, kind of.

13:39.520 --> 13:43.600
I don't actually believe what you're saying.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.120
I think that the boss caught you.

13:48.240 --> 13:49.920
OK, if I could back up for a second.

13:49.920 --> 13:52.320
I'm sorry that I got so suspicious of you.

13:52.320 --> 13:54.160
I thank you for your support over the years.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.720
I assume that you're going to maximumfund.org

13:56.720 --> 13:58.720
forward slash donate and give me money to the show.

13:58.720 --> 13:59.840
And I so appreciate that.

13:59.840 --> 14:00.560
Thank you.

14:00.560 --> 14:01.680
I'll believe you if you do that.

14:01.680 --> 14:02.640
That's easy.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.000
Yeah, that's an easy one, it's a slam dunk.

14:05.680 --> 14:11.280
I don't know that your boss necessarily thinks it's a porn

14:11.280 --> 14:17.760
thing because that would be wild to have a folder on your

14:17.760 --> 14:21.120
computer called meats and that's for porn.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.800
That's like very close.

14:22.800 --> 14:25.200
That's barely, that's a semi cloak.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.200
That's not even actually cloaking it.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.480
Everybody's porn links are in the same directory and it's

14:30.480 --> 14:35.280
labeled productivity and finance spreadsheets for business.

14:36.320 --> 14:37.600
It's definitely not.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.840
Or simply media.

14:42.720 --> 14:43.840
Because that's not a lie.

14:43.840 --> 14:44.880
It's not inaccurate.

14:44.880 --> 14:47.280
It's not an inaccurate sort of filing mechanism.

14:48.320 --> 14:51.520
The only reason you would label the folder meats is if you're

14:51.520 --> 14:54.800
trying to be sneaky, but also you know how forgetful you are.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.920
Like you also make your password password one, two, three.

14:57.920 --> 15:00.640
And you're like, well, I want to hide my porn links, but I

15:00.640 --> 15:01.520
don't want to lose them.

15:02.160 --> 15:07.760
Yeah, I don't think there's anything you can do except, oh

15:07.760 --> 15:14.240
my gosh, if you get your boss a meat for Christmas, when you

15:14.240 --> 15:18.800
give them the gift, you say, this is going to sound wild,

15:18.800 --> 15:21.520
but do you remember when you saw a directory called meats on

15:21.520 --> 15:22.320
my computer?

15:22.320 --> 15:24.640
This is assuming you haven't been summarily fired.

15:25.280 --> 15:27.360
You remember when you saw the directory, that was what this

15:27.360 --> 15:27.920
was for.

15:27.920 --> 15:29.360
I couldn't tell you back then.

15:30.480 --> 15:31.920
Because then it seems like commitment.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.520
It doesn't seem like you're backpedaling.

15:33.520 --> 15:37.200
It seems like you are committed to surprising everybody with

15:37.200 --> 15:38.240
some great meat.

15:38.960 --> 15:44.560
And they're going to say, this is Hillshire farm sliced roast

15:44.560 --> 15:46.240
beef that you got from Kroger's.

15:47.200 --> 15:48.720
It was pornography.

15:48.720 --> 15:50.080
Just own it.

15:50.080 --> 15:50.880
Own it.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.000
It's fine if it was.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.640
Can I offer a very drastic solution to this?

15:54.640 --> 15:56.080
Even more commitment?

15:56.080 --> 15:59.120
You're going to have to go into work tomorrow, quit and

15:59.120 --> 16:01.520
announce that you're leaving to become a butcher.

16:02.640 --> 16:06.560
I mean, you've been dreaming of this for months and it's time

16:06.560 --> 16:09.760
that you finally committed to your lifelong passion,

16:10.320 --> 16:10.960
butchering.

16:11.840 --> 16:12.560
Perfect.

16:12.560 --> 16:13.600
Yeah, that should work too.

16:13.600 --> 16:14.080
Either one.

16:14.080 --> 16:15.520
We've given you a lot of good stuff to go on.

16:15.520 --> 16:16.640
How about a Yahoo?

16:16.640 --> 16:17.360
I'd love that.

16:17.360 --> 16:18.240
Thank you so much.

16:19.440 --> 16:22.720
I got a good one here and it's from Alex P.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.880
It's from Yahoo Answers user Akash.

16:24.880 --> 16:27.520
And we've never really done one like this, but I thought it

16:27.520 --> 16:29.760
would be a fun sort of conversation starter on this

16:29.760 --> 16:32.400
light and loose third Halloween episode of the year.

16:32.960 --> 16:33.440
Okay.

16:33.440 --> 16:38.640
Akash asks, would you rather have a cat with a human face

16:38.640 --> 16:40.960
or a dog with human hands instead of paws?

16:42.080 --> 16:45.600
A cat with a cat with a human face.

16:48.160 --> 16:49.200
Still meows?

16:49.200 --> 16:50.000
Should we assume?

16:51.360 --> 16:54.640
Let's let Justin finish because that Travis just brought

16:54.640 --> 16:56.960
up something that's going to really change the dynamic.

16:56.960 --> 17:00.080
A cat with a human face or a dog with human hands

17:00.080 --> 17:00.880
instead of paws?

17:01.920 --> 17:02.720
Correct.

17:02.720 --> 17:04.320
And feet or four hands?

17:04.320 --> 17:06.320
Yeah, that was another question.

17:06.320 --> 17:09.360
Yeah, it just says hands instead of paws.

17:09.360 --> 17:12.720
So I was assuming two, but it could be four.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.560
No, it has to be just two.

17:14.560 --> 17:18.000
I can almost wrap my mind around that, but there's something

17:18.000 --> 17:20.240
about it having four hands.

17:21.120 --> 17:21.360
Yeah.

17:21.360 --> 17:24.080
That's really, because I could see the dog then maybe

17:24.080 --> 17:27.600
walking on its hind legs and having hands a la like

17:28.160 --> 17:31.360
the funny dog from Family Guy, but like-

17:31.360 --> 17:33.040
Oh, I love him.

17:33.040 --> 17:34.480
I love this human.

17:34.480 --> 17:41.280
I love the way he drinks, but the idea of four human hands

17:41.280 --> 17:43.040
plodding along on the ground.

17:43.680 --> 17:44.400
It's too many.

17:44.400 --> 17:45.520
It's more than I have.

17:45.520 --> 17:47.360
It's more than I have and therefore he would pose

17:47.360 --> 17:49.920
a threat to me and my family's safety.

17:49.920 --> 17:52.080
I mean, he's going to with two hands, four hands,

17:52.080 --> 17:53.760
like we're all done, right?

17:53.760 --> 17:54.320
Yes.

17:54.320 --> 17:57.680
This is so tough because it's like the face cat is going to

17:57.680 --> 18:01.760
be no good, especially if it talks human language.

18:01.760 --> 18:03.440
That's no good.

18:03.440 --> 18:05.120
That is so bad.

18:05.120 --> 18:07.760
Sometimes I'll be like peeing, right?

18:07.760 --> 18:12.480
And like the cat will be in the bathroom because that is

18:12.480 --> 18:13.840
where her food bowl is.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.680
And like, she'll look at me and it's fine because she's

18:15.680 --> 18:19.200
a cat, but now imagine that that was a human face.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.720
Yeah, that's rough.

18:20.720 --> 18:21.520
It is rough.

18:21.520 --> 18:26.480
It's going to look and the thing is, the law of doppelgangers

18:26.480 --> 18:29.360
says that it will look exactly like somebody on Earth.

18:30.160 --> 18:31.520
And we don't know who.

18:31.520 --> 18:32.880
It could be anybody.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.960
What if it looks like Hugh Jackman?

18:34.960 --> 18:36.560
What if it looks like my brother Justin?

18:36.560 --> 18:38.880
What if it looks like Justin dresses Wolverine?

18:40.000 --> 18:41.440
It's impossible to say.

18:41.440 --> 18:44.080
I want to give a counterpoint because this is actually

18:44.080 --> 18:45.120
a very good question.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.000
I think at this point.

18:46.000 --> 18:46.240
Yes.

18:46.960 --> 18:50.160
The problem I have with dog with hands is this.

18:50.160 --> 18:54.240
Guys, you've created this crime, right?

18:54.240 --> 18:59.920
This crime against the natural order that's sure to live

18:59.920 --> 19:03.280
in a lot, I mean, a lot of spiritual and sort of

19:03.280 --> 19:04.400
existential pain.

19:04.960 --> 19:08.480
And what you've done is in addition to making it monster,

19:08.480 --> 19:12.560
more monster than canine, you've also given it all the

19:12.560 --> 19:14.160
equipment it needs to use a gun.

19:14.960 --> 19:16.320
And that I hate.

19:16.320 --> 19:16.960
That I hate.

19:16.960 --> 19:23.520
I hate the fact that it can now use use tools and including

19:23.520 --> 19:26.880
tools, one of those tools being a gun that can use to

19:26.880 --> 19:29.760
take vengeance on you for willing it into existence.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.360
And I hate that part.

19:31.360 --> 19:34.480
Facecat, you have not made more lethal by creating.

19:34.480 --> 19:35.200
There's no choice.

19:35.200 --> 19:36.000
It is facecat.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.040
You must choose facecat.

19:38.000 --> 19:38.960
Hand dog will kill you.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.120
Hand dog will kill you for making it facecat.

19:41.120 --> 19:44.480
We'll try to kill you, but we'll have no enhanced lethality.

19:44.480 --> 19:47.120
Not only that, like facecat's going to suck to be around and

19:47.120 --> 19:49.120
you got to be around it because you can't throw it out because

19:49.120 --> 19:50.720
it has a human face, right?

19:50.720 --> 19:54.640
But dog, hand dog, if it doesn't kill you, it's still

19:54.640 --> 19:55.920
going to get up to no good.

19:55.920 --> 19:57.680
He has a dog's brain.

19:57.680 --> 19:59.120
So maybe he won't think to kill you.

19:59.120 --> 20:01.760
Maybe he still loves you because he's got a dog brain.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.360
But he also has a dog brain.

20:03.360 --> 20:04.400
He has a dog hunger.

20:04.400 --> 20:09.200
So he's going to go in the kitchen and, you know, eat all

20:09.200 --> 20:10.720
of the eat all of the lunch meat.

20:10.720 --> 20:11.440
And you can't tell him.

20:11.440 --> 20:15.360
No, that's like telling a roommate, like, no, no, you

20:15.360 --> 20:16.480
can't eat the lunch meat.

20:16.480 --> 20:18.240
But they have human hands, so they're going to do what the

20:18.240 --> 20:19.440
fuck they want to do.

20:19.440 --> 20:23.120
But that's assuming that then hand dog is capable of

20:23.120 --> 20:24.400
utilizing the hand.

20:24.400 --> 20:27.360
Because right now it's not like my dog with her paws is walking

20:27.360 --> 20:29.520
up and trying and getting frustrated because it doesn't

20:29.520 --> 20:29.760
work.

20:29.760 --> 20:30.720
They can shake them.

20:30.720 --> 20:31.600
They can shake.

20:31.600 --> 20:34.400
They can sit on their hind legs and use the hand to shoot a

20:34.400 --> 20:34.800
gun.

20:34.800 --> 20:35.840
No question.

20:35.840 --> 20:36.560
No question.

20:36.560 --> 20:39.360
But you've just made me- that sealed the deal right there.

20:39.360 --> 20:42.800
The idea of doing, like, shake with a dog and a human hand.

20:42.800 --> 20:46.400
A full, meaty sailor's hand just extending out and taking

20:46.400 --> 20:46.640
years.

20:46.640 --> 20:49.440
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

20:49.440 --> 20:56.640
You- I can't- I can't have a cat with a human face, though.

20:56.640 --> 20:58.080
I don't want that either.

20:59.520 --> 21:00.160
You-

21:00.160 --> 21:02.080
Cat eyes or human eyes?

21:02.080 --> 21:03.040
Okay, can it talk?

21:04.160 --> 21:04.400
Yes.

21:05.280 --> 21:05.840
It has to talk.

21:05.840 --> 21:06.400
I'm out.

21:06.400 --> 21:07.760
I'm so fucking out.

21:07.760 --> 21:10.000
Actually, I have less of a problem with that.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.880
It can talk and it sounds exactly like Lorenzo music.

21:12.880 --> 21:13.360
Yes.

21:13.360 --> 21:14.320
I love that.

21:14.320 --> 21:15.200
Now I'm back in.

21:15.200 --> 21:16.560
Does it eat cat food?

21:16.560 --> 21:17.840
I'm backed out again.

21:17.840 --> 21:18.880
I don't want to see that.

21:18.880 --> 21:19.760
That's the thing.

21:19.760 --> 21:23.280
If the cat can talk, then at the very least, I can A,

21:23.280 --> 21:27.920
apologize and B, like, that- like, I get that.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.720
But if it just has a human face that meows, I'm always going to

21:30.720 --> 21:32.960
be looking at it thinking, do you understand?

21:32.960 --> 21:33.840
Like, do you know?

21:34.400 --> 21:36.000
Do you know what's happening right now?

21:36.000 --> 21:37.520
Like, are you watching me?

21:37.520 --> 21:38.400
Do you hate me?

21:38.400 --> 21:39.680
What's happening?

21:39.680 --> 21:44.000
And I don't want to see what the human face looks like when

21:44.000 --> 21:46.640
the cat makes brown in the litter box.

21:46.640 --> 21:47.360
Mm-hmm.

21:47.360 --> 21:48.800
I don't want to have to confront that.

21:48.800 --> 21:49.280
Catches a mouse?

21:49.840 --> 21:53.920
Or catches a mouse and- oh no, Trav.

21:53.920 --> 21:55.440
Yeah, or licks itself.

21:56.080 --> 22:03.520
But you can put sunglasses on it and-

22:03.520 --> 22:03.680
Yeah.

22:05.280 --> 22:06.240
Come on.

22:06.240 --> 22:08.080
But you could put mittens on the dog.

22:08.640 --> 22:13.040
The only reason I'm going face cat, face cat sucks unilaterally,

22:13.040 --> 22:15.600
but it won't try and kill me like hand dog.

22:15.600 --> 22:16.320
I'm done.

22:16.320 --> 22:18.080
It's face cat for life.

22:18.640 --> 22:19.120
Okay.

22:21.360 --> 22:22.160
I can't.

22:22.160 --> 22:23.360
You- you gripping?

22:23.360 --> 22:24.880
You have to- you have- okay.

22:25.520 --> 22:28.880
The dog won't want to kill you, probably.

22:28.880 --> 22:32.640
The cat will have the face of Rush Limbaugh, definitely.

22:32.640 --> 22:36.080
And it'll just be waiting for you in the dark all the time.

22:36.080 --> 22:40.240
Imagine, Griffin, imagine that you wake up at three o'clock in the morning

22:40.240 --> 22:43.360
because you need to get some Imodium, and you walk into the hall,

22:43.360 --> 22:44.720
and who's that waiting for you?

22:44.720 --> 22:46.880
It's the face of Joe Pantlione.

22:46.880 --> 22:52.720
He's trotting towards you, sashaying back and forth from your cat's body.

22:52.720 --> 22:55.680
And what if it can talk, but it can just say,

22:55.680 --> 22:58.560
hey, in a human voice over and over.

22:58.560 --> 23:00.480
No, don't try to take the legs out from this.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.040
It talks.

23:01.040 --> 23:01.840
It talks human.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.120
I can have a conversation with it.

23:03.120 --> 23:03.760
I work from home.

23:03.760 --> 23:04.320
I'm lonely.

23:04.320 --> 23:05.600
Now I want face cat.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.360
Now it's not, I don't want hand dog.

23:07.360 --> 23:09.680
Now it's, I want face cat very badly.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.360
Science, make me a face cat.

23:11.360 --> 23:13.760
You want a cat that's just like other cats,

23:13.760 --> 23:17.440
except it screams, why am I, at the top of its little lungs.

23:17.440 --> 23:19.280
Why have you done this, creator?

23:19.280 --> 23:21.920
You'll scream that for a bit, but then you'll be into it.

23:21.920 --> 23:22.880
Then it'll be fun.

23:22.880 --> 23:24.400
Acceptance therapy.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.640
Is it like a full human head or just the face?

23:27.840 --> 23:31.200
It looks like a cat, like Mario in a Tanooki suit, right?

23:31.200 --> 23:31.760
For sure.

23:31.760 --> 23:32.800
Yeah, that's pretty good.

23:32.800 --> 23:35.920
And now hand dog.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.640
Can this guy play a guitar?

23:40.480 --> 23:41.760
I don't think the hands would be,

23:41.760 --> 23:44.880
maybe ukulele is maybe the best.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.200
All right, now we're coming.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.960
See, now I'm trying to frame this like,

23:48.960 --> 23:51.680
which one do I want very badly more?

23:51.680 --> 23:53.680
Not which one is the least bad.

23:53.680 --> 23:57.360
And if you look at it that way, I'm kind of torn.

23:57.360 --> 23:58.640
What's his words per minute?

23:58.640 --> 24:01.360
Does he know how to, can he edit a podcast?

24:01.360 --> 24:02.560
Can he edit a podcast?

24:02.560 --> 24:03.200
Yes, yes.

24:03.200 --> 24:04.400
Can he use Squarespace?

24:04.400 --> 24:06.240
Probably, it's very user-friendly.

24:06.240 --> 24:07.920
Now, hold on though.

24:07.920 --> 24:10.080
When he cranks it, does he use his human hands?

24:10.080 --> 24:11.920
I'm back to face cat.

24:11.920 --> 24:12.960
Hi, face cat.

24:12.960 --> 24:14.400
Welcome back, Griffin.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.240
See, Griffin, what if his voice

24:16.240 --> 24:18.720
wasn't that like beautiful bear tone?

24:18.720 --> 24:20.720
He's still not gonna jerk it with human hands.

24:20.720 --> 24:21.920
I'm good, I'm good.

24:21.920 --> 24:23.840
Face cat, can't face cat for life.

24:24.400 --> 24:26.560
I'm gonna have to, I think I'm going hand dog.

24:27.280 --> 24:30.160
Hand dog plus mittens, I'm okay with that.

24:30.960 --> 24:32.000
See, that's cruel though.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.400
That's cruel because you've not only transformed him

24:34.400 --> 24:35.600
into a complete monster,

24:35.600 --> 24:38.720
you have sort of taken away the only like agency

24:38.720 --> 24:41.120
that you have given him in this monstrous form.

24:41.120 --> 24:42.960
That's the most fucked up option, Travis.

24:43.760 --> 24:46.320
Okay, the mittens won't be an all the time thing.

24:46.320 --> 24:48.000
Well, when it's cold, right?

24:48.000 --> 24:48.880
Just like a human.

24:49.520 --> 24:50.020
Sure.

24:51.440 --> 24:55.920
God, I feel like I felt such strong conviction both ways

24:55.920 --> 25:00.960
at this point and I feel, I mean, I'm glad neither,

25:00.960 --> 25:03.040
but I'm sad both, you know what I mean?

25:03.040 --> 25:04.640
Yeah, I do.

25:04.640 --> 25:09.200
Like it seems like if the world is gonna make one of them,

25:09.200 --> 25:10.880
it should have to make both of them.

25:10.880 --> 25:11.280
Both of them, yeah.

25:11.280 --> 25:13.520
Like they should have to be friends

25:13.520 --> 25:15.520
or in the same house or whatever.

25:15.520 --> 25:16.160
Where are we at?

25:16.160 --> 25:17.280
I mean, let's just take a vote.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.720
I could love hand dog.

25:18.720 --> 25:19.840
No, let's just take a vote.

25:19.840 --> 25:21.040
I wanna take a vote right now.

25:21.040 --> 25:22.320
I already love face cat.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.320
Griffin votes face cat, Travis.

25:24.320 --> 25:25.200
I vote hand dog.

25:25.760 --> 25:28.320
Tiebreaker, and the other one dies, so.

25:28.320 --> 25:29.040
Yeah.

25:29.040 --> 25:31.440
The problem is I already have two faces

25:32.080 --> 25:36.320
that are very dependent on me in my journey

25:36.880 --> 25:39.520
and I don't know that I need a third face

25:39.520 --> 25:41.760
no matter what it's attached to, truly.

25:42.720 --> 25:48.000
I don't need a third face that's sort of dependent on me

25:48.000 --> 25:50.800
and sort of needing my guidance and expertise

25:50.800 --> 25:54.720
and wisdom and coddling and what have you.

25:55.360 --> 25:56.800
I think it's very beautiful, Justin,

25:56.800 --> 25:58.560
that you're counting your children's faces

25:58.560 --> 25:59.840
but not your own.

25:59.840 --> 26:01.040
Well, nor my wife's

26:01.040 --> 26:02.240
because they're not dependents.

26:02.240 --> 26:03.760
I'm saying that I have two babies

26:04.320 --> 26:05.120
that live in my house.

26:05.120 --> 26:07.360
Your face is pretty dependent on you.

26:07.360 --> 26:09.600
Yeah, you do need to feed your own face, my pal.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.680
Yeah, but I'm saying that these faces,

26:11.680 --> 26:13.760
these two, it's like a third child.

26:13.760 --> 26:14.400
I get what you're saying.

26:14.400 --> 26:16.960
You hate my fucking precious baby.

26:16.960 --> 26:17.920
I get what you're saying, Justin.

26:17.920 --> 26:18.640
Go ahead and say it.

26:18.640 --> 26:19.920
I'm a hand dog, you idiot.

26:19.920 --> 26:22.640
It's just like I'm an introvert kind of by nature

26:22.640 --> 26:27.040
and I'm trading away those precious moments of solitude.

26:27.040 --> 26:27.600
Okay.

26:27.600 --> 26:30.080
Have fun getting strangled by a dog, you two jerks.

26:30.080 --> 26:30.960
Have fun getting strangled by a dog.

26:30.960 --> 26:32.560
She doesn't have human arms.

26:32.560 --> 26:33.280
Yeah, that's fine.

26:33.280 --> 26:34.400
I'm still stronger.

26:34.400 --> 26:35.840
It doesn't have the power of the human arms.

26:35.840 --> 26:37.840
I don't even think that it could bend the middle way.

26:38.720 --> 26:40.160
I don't think it could flex the hands.

26:40.160 --> 26:41.440
Sure, yeah, yeah.

26:41.440 --> 26:44.080
No, he could totally just inject poison into your neck

26:44.080 --> 26:45.120
while you're asleep.

26:45.120 --> 26:46.240
There's a lot of different ways.

26:46.240 --> 26:47.600
What's he getting poisoned?

26:47.600 --> 26:48.160
No, have fun.

26:48.160 --> 26:49.520
I'll do the podcast by myself

26:49.520 --> 26:51.360
because you two have been killed by your dumb dogs

26:51.360 --> 26:53.440
that you wanted to get instead of my cool face cat

26:53.440 --> 26:54.800
who looks like Joey Pants.

26:54.800 --> 26:56.000
You stinkers.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.960
Joey Pants face cat could talk anyone into murdering you though.

27:02.640 --> 27:04.000
It's a cat with a mouth

27:04.000 --> 27:07.200
and that mouth pet is mightier than the sword kind of thing.

27:07.840 --> 27:09.840
That cat could lead a rebellion.

27:09.840 --> 27:13.680
It could create sort of a krang suit around itself.

27:13.680 --> 27:14.480
Oh, absolutely.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.360
I'm as surprised as anybody

27:17.360 --> 27:19.600
but we're gonna have to take a break at this point

27:19.600 --> 27:29.680
and go to the proverbial money zone.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.160
I want to tell you about Zip Recruiter.

27:37.440 --> 27:39.200
You gotta hire people for stuff.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.000
Look around you.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.760
You have all the cubicles set up.

27:41.760 --> 27:42.720
You bought the coffee.

27:43.280 --> 27:46.400
You have all the spreadsheets ready to be filled in

27:46.400 --> 27:47.760
but what did you forget?

27:47.760 --> 27:51.040
You forgot to hire people and you know what's not smart?

27:51.040 --> 27:52.560
The way hiring used to be

27:53.280 --> 27:55.120
or like job sites that overwhelm you

27:55.120 --> 27:57.040
with tons of the wrong resume.

27:57.040 --> 27:58.080
I'll tell you what is smart.

27:58.880 --> 28:01.920
Going to ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

28:01.920 --> 28:03.360
Zip Recruiter is powerful.

28:03.360 --> 28:06.160
Matching technology finds the right people for you

28:06.160 --> 28:08.080
and actively invites them to apply.

28:08.080 --> 28:09.280
You're not just waiting.

28:09.280 --> 28:10.160
You're not just waiting.

28:10.160 --> 28:11.440
They say, hey, you're perfect.

28:11.440 --> 28:12.480
Get in here.

28:12.480 --> 28:15.040
So it's no wonder that Zip Recruiter is rated number one

28:15.040 --> 28:16.160
by employers in the US

28:16.160 --> 28:19.040
and this rating comes from hiring sites on Trustpilot

28:19.040 --> 28:21.040
with over a thousand reviews

28:21.040 --> 28:24.480
and right now our listeners can try Zip Recruiter for free

28:24.480 --> 28:26.800
at ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

28:26.800 --> 28:30.400
That's ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

28:30.400 --> 28:37.520
Would the face on the cat age in relation to the cat's body?

28:37.520 --> 28:39.520
The cat never dies nor does the dog.

28:40.160 --> 28:44.000
Okay, because just thinking about it getting old and wrinkly

28:44.000 --> 28:46.400
very, very fast just kind of bum me out.

28:46.400 --> 28:49.600
But if it's eternal, then that's better.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.440
Can I tell you all about Casper though?

28:51.440 --> 28:51.760
Yes.

28:52.320 --> 28:53.440
They are fantastic.

28:53.440 --> 28:54.640
They have the mattresses.

28:54.640 --> 28:56.240
They have the mattresses that you need.

28:56.240 --> 28:57.680
They're the mattresses that you want.

28:57.680 --> 28:59.280
They're the mattresses that you crave.

28:59.280 --> 29:01.840
Delicious scrumptious mattresses.

29:01.840 --> 29:02.960
The mattress you deserve.

29:02.960 --> 29:03.600
On the table.

29:04.480 --> 29:05.360
They are so good.

29:06.080 --> 29:07.600
We're supported by Casper this week.

29:07.600 --> 29:09.600
They're a sleep brand that continues to revolutionize

29:09.600 --> 29:12.000
its line of products to create an exceptionally comfortable

29:12.000 --> 29:14.080
sleep experience one night at a time.

29:14.080 --> 29:16.560
They got affordable prices because they cut out the middleman

29:16.560 --> 29:17.600
and sell directly to you.

29:17.600 --> 29:21.280
We, I think, all have Casper mattresses at this point.

29:21.280 --> 29:25.120
And my guests, when they stay at our house, get rave reviews.

29:25.840 --> 29:27.680
Well, they give them, but they also get them.

29:27.680 --> 29:30.240
Before they lay down on the bed, I say, listen, here's how good

29:30.240 --> 29:31.520
this bed's going to be.

29:31.520 --> 29:31.920
Charles M.

29:31.920 --> 29:33.920
Oh, I thought you meant you look at them and you say,

29:33.920 --> 29:35.760
let me tell you how great you are.

29:35.760 --> 29:36.720
You're doing great.

29:36.720 --> 29:42.400
But Charles M. from Des Moines says this mattress is da bomb.

29:42.400 --> 29:43.440
Five stars.

29:43.440 --> 29:45.040

30:10.320 --> 30:11.440
And it's for Peter.

30:11.440 --> 30:13.200
And it goes a little something like this.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.040
Happy meat-aversary, Peter.

30:15.040 --> 30:17.200
Now this one, I'm going to be real clear and say it's

30:17.200 --> 30:20.480
M-A-E-T-aversary, Peter.

30:21.040 --> 30:22.400
You are so wonderful.

30:22.400 --> 30:24.640
And every moment with you is pure magic.

30:24.640 --> 30:28.320
Thank you for introducing me to bim bam, saw bones,

30:28.320 --> 30:29.040
and wonderful.

30:29.920 --> 30:33.920
I'm super excited for our next loft's adventure and cuddles

30:33.920 --> 30:35.040
in the coming years.

30:35.040 --> 30:36.800
I cannot wait to marry you.

30:36.800 --> 30:38.800
I love you to the moon and back.

30:39.360 --> 30:43.520
And that is so sweet and was supposed to be read eight

30:43.520 --> 30:47.280
months ago, but it's still so sweet is the thing about it.

30:47.280 --> 30:49.280
And you know what else is sweet?

30:49.280 --> 30:50.960
Like saw bones is good.

30:50.960 --> 30:51.680
Wonderful is good.

30:51.680 --> 30:53.360
But have you tried shmanners?

30:55.440 --> 30:58.000
And that message comes to us from Travis.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.920
Yeah, pay me and Justin $100 right now.

31:00.720 --> 31:02.240
I will in kisses.

31:02.240 --> 31:05.040
No, Venmo me $100 fucking dollars right now, you creep.

31:06.720 --> 31:07.040
You know what?

31:07.040 --> 31:09.360
I'm going to do the other one too, because that's how I'm going

31:09.360 --> 31:09.680
to do it.

31:09.680 --> 31:12.160
It's for Dylan and it's from your cat, special boy.

31:13.600 --> 31:14.400
Oh, no.

31:14.400 --> 31:15.520
Oh, no, no, no.

31:15.520 --> 31:16.020
Meow.

31:16.960 --> 31:17.840
Hello.

31:17.840 --> 31:18.640
I love you.

31:19.520 --> 31:24.560
Sorry I don't understand soft paws and break the no slapping

31:24.560 --> 31:25.840
rule constantly.

31:26.560 --> 31:30.480
Also, sorry for running out the front door all the time.

31:30.480 --> 31:34.560
The hallway is just so interesting, but also scary.

31:35.360 --> 31:38.160
So please continue to rescue me.

31:39.360 --> 31:40.480
Meow.

31:41.120 --> 31:42.320
Oh, no, no, no, no.

31:42.880 --> 31:43.680
That's great.

31:43.680 --> 31:48.320
How did the cat get the money to can face cat get a job in

31:48.320 --> 31:49.680
like customer service?

31:49.680 --> 31:50.480
Yeah, yeah.

31:52.480 --> 31:53.760
I'm all about that.

31:53.760 --> 31:55.520
Love this crazy cat.

31:55.520 --> 32:00.560
Crazy cat, but then hand dog could totally be a typist or

32:00.560 --> 32:02.800
manual labor for sure.

32:04.480 --> 32:05.200
This is what I'm saying.

32:05.200 --> 32:07.680
Not enough people are interested in manual labor jobs like

32:07.680 --> 32:09.840
mechanic and plumber and electrician.

32:10.560 --> 32:13.280
Hand dog could fill in that it is.

32:13.280 --> 32:17.040
It is starting to raise the question of which one could move

32:17.040 --> 32:19.760
out, which is usually desirable.

32:19.760 --> 32:22.240
Which one can become autonomous and not my problem.

32:22.240 --> 32:26.640
I feel like face cat is going to be able to get a social

32:26.640 --> 32:30.880
security number much easier than hand dog would, right?

32:30.880 --> 32:32.640
Hand dog could drive.

32:32.640 --> 32:35.280
No, here's what it's going to be in the eyes of the law.

32:35.280 --> 32:36.000
And this is it.

32:36.640 --> 32:38.560
This is a dog with human hands.

32:38.560 --> 32:40.400
This is a human with a cat body.

32:42.080 --> 32:43.520
Oh, you're right.

32:43.520 --> 32:44.400
Oh, shit.

32:44.400 --> 32:45.520
Yeah, it's true.

32:46.320 --> 32:49.360
He has a passport now because he's a human with a cat body.

32:49.360 --> 32:51.520
We can't discuss, but I'm not going to give a passport to a

32:51.520 --> 32:52.720
fucking dog.

32:52.720 --> 33:22.640
Note this far, no further.

33:22.640 --> 33:25.600
A sister's guide to teens through the ages.

33:25.600 --> 33:30.080
I am a teenager and I was two.

33:30.080 --> 33:42.960
Butts, butts, butts, butts, butts.

33:42.960 --> 33:46.080
My husband and I live in a small haunted apartment building

33:46.080 --> 33:49.920
with just six units, mostly occupied by other couples and

33:49.920 --> 33:51.200
also some ghosts.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.520
We've lived here for seven years and have become friendly

33:53.520 --> 33:57.040
with some of the other tenants, occasionally having meals or

33:57.040 --> 33:58.800
cocktails at each other's places.

33:58.800 --> 33:59.840
Here's my dilemma.

34:01.040 --> 34:03.760
When I'm at another tenant's place and I have to use the

34:03.760 --> 34:08.080
bathroom, should I use the one there or leave and use my own

34:08.080 --> 34:09.520
mere steps away?

34:09.520 --> 34:11.200
Oh, huh.

34:12.080 --> 34:14.960
Of course, I want the sweet, sweet security of my own

34:14.960 --> 34:16.080
porcelain haven.

34:16.080 --> 34:18.640
But is that weird or even insulting?

34:18.640 --> 34:22.000
So far, I just held it and waited until I got home.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.360
That's the right answer.

34:23.360 --> 34:26.560
Usually, when we socialize with other tenants, it's just us and

34:26.560 --> 34:27.280
the other couples.

34:27.280 --> 34:29.680
So it's not like a party situation where I could just

34:29.680 --> 34:31.760
slip out and back unnoticed.

34:31.760 --> 34:32.560
Help me.

34:32.560 --> 34:34.880
There's no place like home in San Francisco.

34:34.880 --> 34:37.120
This one, this is so easy.

34:37.120 --> 34:38.320
Can we just move on to the next?

34:38.320 --> 34:43.200
Because you can give a nearby guest your pee pee, but you

34:43.200 --> 34:44.320
can't give them your poo poo.

34:44.320 --> 34:46.240
If it's a poo poo, you have to go home and do it there.

34:46.240 --> 34:47.280
If it's a pee pee, you do it wherever you want.

34:47.280 --> 34:49.440
I'm so glad we agree, Griffin.

34:49.440 --> 34:52.240
Yeah, because we've dealt with that with our hotel rules.

34:52.240 --> 34:54.240
If you're hanging out in a friend's hotel room and yours

34:54.240 --> 34:57.680
is 20 feet away, you can give them your pee pee, but you

34:57.680 --> 34:58.800
can't give them your poo poo.

34:58.800 --> 34:59.440
That's it.

34:59.440 --> 35:00.000
Next question.

35:00.000 --> 35:00.880
Huge problem.

35:01.520 --> 35:02.640
Do you have to explain that?

35:02.640 --> 35:06.400
If what you're saying is the accepted law and from your

35:06.400 --> 35:10.400
tone, that is, it seems to be settled law from what you're

35:11.200 --> 35:16.640
saying, then we are creating a culture where if you say,

35:16.640 --> 35:21.200
excuse me, I have to go to my apartment for approximately

35:21.200 --> 35:22.720
five to 10 minutes.

35:22.720 --> 35:25.760
You are then announcing your intent to have a bowel

35:25.760 --> 35:30.960
movement, which is not necessarily part of the culture

35:30.960 --> 35:33.920
is not announcing I'm going to go shit.

35:33.920 --> 35:35.440
We just, it's simply not done.

35:36.160 --> 35:39.360
Well, another part of the culture is not dropping a big

35:39.360 --> 35:44.960
one inside of this domicile when yours is so very close

35:44.960 --> 35:46.800
and they're definitely going to notice how long you've

35:46.800 --> 35:49.520
been in there and they're also going to notice the bad

35:49.520 --> 35:52.080
smells that you did make with all of your process.

35:52.080 --> 35:53.600
Not necessarily arguing that.

35:53.600 --> 35:58.880
I'm arguing that if you have this standard where I pee

35:58.880 --> 36:02.720
pee at your house, I poo poo at mine, you are making it

36:02.720 --> 36:06.400
so people can always track if you've left to go poo poo,

36:06.400 --> 36:07.120
which is not great.

36:07.120 --> 36:10.000
This is why we need a social understanding.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.440
We need something like how pirates have the black spot

36:13.440 --> 36:16.080
where you just like slide a card onto the table and

36:16.080 --> 36:19.680
everyone knows what that card means, but in using that

36:19.680 --> 36:23.680
card, everyone is also agreeing like if this was me,

36:23.680 --> 36:26.320
we would all pretend like this wasn't happening.

36:26.320 --> 36:30.560
And let me also say, if I know that the two of you left

36:30.560 --> 36:34.880
my house or room so that you could go and poo poo somewhere

36:34.880 --> 36:38.160
else, when you come back, I will have a Harry and David

36:38.160 --> 36:41.200
cheese basket waiting for you as a thank you gift.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.120
I don't know why you think this is an embarrassing thing

36:43.120 --> 36:45.760
as much as it is me knowing that you've done me a great

36:45.760 --> 36:47.040
service this day.

36:47.040 --> 36:49.600
I cannot tell you how many times every single one of us

36:49.600 --> 36:52.720
on this call have been on tour with the other ones and

36:52.720 --> 36:54.720
they've been in their room and they say, well, I'm going

36:54.720 --> 36:58.400
to wreck your bathroom real quick and then go back to

36:58.400 --> 36:59.280
my room.

36:59.280 --> 37:00.720
It happens constantly.

37:01.520 --> 37:04.000
Yeah, but now we must put away our childish things.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.160
Please do not poo poo in my hotel room anymore.

37:06.160 --> 37:07.440
It is so bad.

37:07.440 --> 37:08.720
I don't know what you two do.

37:08.720 --> 37:10.480
Well, because here's the thing, it's especially why

37:10.480 --> 37:12.160
you're doing your favorite because you could wreck your

37:12.160 --> 37:14.160
bathroom and leave three minutes later.

37:14.960 --> 37:18.080
Like you're basically saying like, this is yours now.

37:18.080 --> 37:18.720
You know what I mean?

37:18.720 --> 37:20.320
Like, no, no, no, no, no.

37:20.320 --> 37:22.960
And if they don't notice right away and pin it on you,

37:22.960 --> 37:25.600
they're going to pin it on somebody who uses the bathroom

37:25.600 --> 37:26.240
at some point.

37:26.240 --> 37:27.200
It's just so bad.

37:27.200 --> 37:28.000
Poo poo at home.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.120
Can I do a Yahoo?

37:29.120 --> 37:29.680
Yes, please.

37:30.720 --> 37:31.360
Here's a good one.

37:31.360 --> 37:33.040
This one is sent in by lots of people.

37:33.040 --> 37:35.760
It's from a Yahoo answers username, Jack, who asks,

37:35.760 --> 37:41.600
do planes, do planes move faster, slow?

37:43.200 --> 37:45.600
When I look at a sky plane, look slow.

37:47.200 --> 37:49.920
I run faster than I see plane move.

37:49.920 --> 37:50.640
Like what?

37:51.840 --> 37:54.400
How plane look like move so slowly?

37:55.600 --> 37:56.720
Well, it's okay.

37:56.720 --> 37:59.280
So, and they won't teach you this in school because

37:59.280 --> 38:02.880
they're afraid, but basically the plane hovers in the air

38:02.880 --> 38:05.440
and then the earth turns underneath it.

38:05.440 --> 38:06.000
Okay.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.920
And then the plane lands back down.

38:08.640 --> 38:10.560
Yeah, they're part of that's probably right, Trav.

38:11.200 --> 38:14.960
So like, I would say the plane moves probably about as fast

38:14.960 --> 38:18.480
as question askers running, but then add to that rotation

38:18.480 --> 38:19.200
of the earth.

38:19.200 --> 38:23.200
And that's why the plane gets to Phoenix slightly faster

38:23.200 --> 38:24.800
than if you ran to Phoenix.

38:25.520 --> 38:26.160
Okay.

38:26.160 --> 38:26.400
Yeah.

38:26.960 --> 38:29.280
So if I could jump up super high, like a Mario brother,

38:30.480 --> 38:31.920
I could be in Phoenix right now.

38:31.920 --> 38:34.640
I wouldn't like, it would be like that movie Jumper,

38:34.640 --> 38:35.680
but quite literally.

38:35.680 --> 38:35.840
Yeah.

38:35.840 --> 38:37.360
So that's why skipping is faster.

38:38.160 --> 38:38.880
Huh?

38:38.880 --> 38:39.040
Yeah.

38:39.600 --> 38:40.560
Here is the problem.

38:41.440 --> 38:41.760
Yeah.

38:41.760 --> 38:42.720
Sky is big.

38:43.680 --> 38:44.960
Oh damn.

38:44.960 --> 38:48.960
And plane fast, but sky is big.

38:49.680 --> 38:52.080
And not like ground.

38:52.640 --> 38:56.160
Ground is small and you can walk around pretty much

38:56.160 --> 39:02.400
anywhere you want to, but sky is so big that it take plane

39:02.400 --> 39:04.960
long time to cross.

39:04.960 --> 39:08.640
So that is the main kind of issue is that sky so big.

39:09.360 --> 39:11.120
But less to move around.

39:11.120 --> 39:13.120
Less to move around, Travis is right.

39:13.120 --> 39:15.360
Ground, building, mountain, tree.

39:16.240 --> 39:18.960
Now the problem is I go in house and sky go away.

39:19.600 --> 39:21.600
So it can't be that big, can it?

39:21.600 --> 39:22.080
Fickle.

39:22.080 --> 39:23.520
Yeah, it's a fickle baby.

39:23.520 --> 39:24.960
Well, sky sneaky.

39:26.080 --> 39:31.280
Let's also remember, hold your thumb up and look at plane.

39:31.280 --> 39:31.920
Plane.

39:31.920 --> 39:32.880
Plane very small.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.120
It's so fucking small.

39:35.120 --> 39:37.760
And I don't know how they do like the shrinking machine

39:38.640 --> 39:40.800
inside of it or when, because I've been on so many planes

39:40.800 --> 39:42.960
and I've never felt the shrinking machine go off,

39:42.960 --> 39:44.320
but I know they're using it.

39:45.280 --> 39:47.360
Maybe that's why you're not allowed to stand up when the

39:47.360 --> 39:50.400
plane's like going up because it's shrinking very quickly

39:50.400 --> 39:52.800
and your bones aren't good and you might fall over.

39:52.800 --> 39:54.000
Griffin, you dullard.

39:54.720 --> 39:56.560
The Earth is getting bigger.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.560
That's ridiculous because it would have to get bigger

39:58.560 --> 40:00.080
for every flight that's going on.

40:00.080 --> 40:00.400
Yes.

40:00.400 --> 40:01.920
No, Travis, no, come on.

40:01.920 --> 40:03.360
You're getting kind of silly, Trav.

40:03.360 --> 40:04.160
We were all having a lot of fun.

40:04.160 --> 40:06.720
No, I'm telling you, hey Travis, I know it's a little out there.

40:06.720 --> 40:08.240
We were all just having a lot of fun.

40:08.240 --> 40:09.440
I'm a big Earther.

40:09.440 --> 40:10.080
I'm sorry.

40:14.320 --> 40:17.600
That's a real hand dog way of thinking about this situation.

40:17.600 --> 40:19.360
Just telling you, Earth get bigger.

40:20.080 --> 40:23.680
I'm the one who looks at the glass and says, face cap.

40:23.680 --> 40:27.280
Do you think this has been our weirdest episode of like 2018?

40:28.160 --> 40:29.680
Oh, it's our spookiest one for sure.

40:29.680 --> 40:31.840
So I have a coworker who took my cookie.

40:31.840 --> 40:34.480
It was a wrapped cookie like you would pick up at a gas station.

40:34.480 --> 40:37.200
So it definitely was obvious that it wasn't for sharing.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.200
It was meant as a treat for me between doing work.

40:41.200 --> 40:45.200
Another coworker told me he saw him take a big bite out of it

40:45.200 --> 40:46.880
and set it down like it was his.

40:46.880 --> 40:49.600
When confronted about the cookie, he said,

40:49.600 --> 40:59.920
Oh, my bad, you can punch me if you'd like.

40:59.920 --> 41:02.960
With no offer of recompense, brothers, what do I do?

41:02.960 --> 41:05.120
I just wanted a sweet chocolate chip treat

41:05.120 --> 41:08.000
that's from Lost Munch in Midland.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.520
That is amazing because what it has said is like,

41:11.520 --> 41:12.960
I can't make it up to you.

41:12.960 --> 41:14.240
I don't have another cookie.

41:14.880 --> 41:18.720
But we're square because I offered you the chance to do violence to me.

41:18.720 --> 41:20.240
Yeah, I'll shoot.

41:20.240 --> 41:21.600
Well, beat my ass, I guess.

41:23.520 --> 41:24.880
Hey, no, it's not my kink.

41:24.880 --> 41:26.320
I don't know why you...

41:26.320 --> 41:29.440
No, I eat your cookie and you beat my ass.

41:29.440 --> 41:30.640
It's just a regular thing.

41:30.640 --> 41:31.360
I don't understand.

41:31.360 --> 41:34.640
Yeah, this is how we do the cost of doing business.

41:34.640 --> 41:36.320
I knew when I took a bite of that cookie,

41:36.320 --> 41:38.720
I was running the risk of getting my ass beat.

41:38.720 --> 41:40.080
And that's why I justified it

41:40.080 --> 41:43.680
and thought it was an okay thing to do to unwrap a wrapped cookie.

41:43.680 --> 41:44.320
Unbelievable.

41:44.320 --> 41:46.880
You fucking murderer.

41:46.880 --> 41:49.840
That is definitely the calculation that this person did, right?

41:49.840 --> 41:53.280
Like, if I bite this cookie, they're probably gonna wanna punch me.

41:53.280 --> 41:56.720
But I will have gotten a bite of the cookie.

41:56.720 --> 41:58.480
You shouldn't work at this place anymore.

41:58.480 --> 41:59.200
That's obvious, right?

41:59.200 --> 42:00.160
We're all agreed on this.

42:00.160 --> 42:01.600
You have to get a new job.

42:01.600 --> 42:03.200
You can't work with a person like this.

42:03.200 --> 42:04.800
No way, no how, no where.

42:04.800 --> 42:09.680
This is step maybe two, maybe three of like a 10-step path

42:09.680 --> 42:11.760
in which they end up probably killing you.

42:11.760 --> 42:17.840
Now, can you punch them so hard they go through the glass of the vending machine?

42:17.840 --> 42:20.720
And then you can reach in and get all the fucking famous Amos that you want.

42:20.720 --> 42:23.840
A victimless crime.

42:23.840 --> 42:30.160
A victimless, well, there's two victims, actually, as far as I can tell.

42:30.160 --> 42:31.680
It's a double victim crime.

42:31.680 --> 42:33.760
The person you punched in Amos?

42:33.760 --> 42:34.640
And Amos.

42:35.200 --> 42:36.000
Amos Lee.

42:36.000 --> 42:42.720
Famously, that's why he calls himself Famously Amos Lee.

42:42.720 --> 42:47.200
What would they have done if you had just fucking laid them out?

42:47.840 --> 42:48.640
They might have.

42:49.440 --> 42:52.080
What if you had punched him so hard that he died?

42:53.040 --> 42:55.920
What if you punched him in his appendix and at first-

42:55.920 --> 42:57.360
Like your dainty and he died.

42:57.360 --> 42:59.360
And then you had, oh, happy Halloween.

43:00.080 --> 43:05.040
But then you had to go to court and the judge was like,

43:05.040 --> 43:06.320
so what happened?

43:06.320 --> 43:09.040
And you're like, well, long story short,

43:09.040 --> 43:12.240
he took a bite of my cookie, so I killed him.

43:12.240 --> 43:13.920
Yeah, the jury would find you guilty,

43:13.920 --> 43:16.320
but then the coroner would run in last minute and be like,

43:16.320 --> 43:18.720
hold up, we just finished cutting his tummy open.

43:18.720 --> 43:20.160
There is a bite of cookie in there.

43:20.160 --> 43:21.840
And then the judge is like, okay.

43:21.840 --> 43:23.280
And then note in his pocket that says,

43:23.280 --> 43:24.720
if I took a bite of someone's cookie,

43:24.720 --> 43:26.720
they're allowed to punch me as hard as they can.

43:28.720 --> 43:29.840
Did you do it though?

43:29.840 --> 43:31.600
That's what I need to know is if you did it,

43:31.600 --> 43:33.280
because you didn't say if you did it or not.

43:33.280 --> 43:36.560
Because if not, what you need to do is you need to wait.

43:36.560 --> 43:41.120
You need to hold that and then one day punch him.

43:41.120 --> 43:42.560
And when he's like, what the hell?

43:42.560 --> 43:44.000
You're like, that's for the cookie.

43:44.560 --> 43:48.240
Yeah, and he didn't specify where to punch him.

43:48.240 --> 43:50.480
You could punch him on the crown of his head

43:50.480 --> 43:51.760
and he wouldn't like that, I bet.

43:52.320 --> 43:54.560
Ooh, wait till he's eating a cookie.

43:54.560 --> 43:57.440
This could be years later and you punch his hand,

43:57.440 --> 43:59.920
knock that cookie right out of his fucking hand

43:59.920 --> 44:01.520
so it shatters on the ground.

44:01.520 --> 44:03.200
Yeah, yeah, that's good.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.280
Yeah, that's fucking good.

44:05.280 --> 44:07.040
Punch his butt so hard his wallet comes out

44:07.040 --> 44:09.120
and you get cookie buying money from it.

44:09.120 --> 44:10.480
There's a lot of options actually.

44:10.480 --> 44:12.640
It depends on how accurate your punches are.

44:12.640 --> 44:15.120
Can you punch a wallet out of a dude's butt pocket?

44:15.840 --> 44:17.200
This week on Mythbusters.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.640
This week we brought it back for this one special

44:20.640 --> 44:22.720
and it's a McElroy Brothers special.

44:22.720 --> 44:24.080
Can a cat have a face?

44:26.160 --> 44:27.280
Where should you poo poo?

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Where should you make poo poo?

44:30.000 --> 44:30.800
Poo poo.

44:30.800 --> 44:32.560
We tried doing it at our friend's house.

44:32.560 --> 44:33.520
He didn't like it.

44:33.520 --> 44:34.320
Myth confirmed.

44:38.880 --> 44:40.560
I got a Haunted Doll watch.

44:40.560 --> 44:41.680
Yeah, I know, that's what that song means.

44:41.680 --> 44:45.200
It's a Halloween episode and I thought this was perfect

44:45.200 --> 44:47.440
to help us bridge the gap between seasons

44:47.440 --> 44:49.040
so I was very excited to find it.

44:49.040 --> 44:52.960
Got a Haunted Doll Gloria active paranormal winter

44:52.960 --> 44:54.960
slash Christmas spirit dolls.

44:54.960 --> 44:55.460
Ooh.

44:56.160 --> 44:58.160
I am sharing my special winter

44:58.160 --> 44:59.920
and Christmas spirit doll collection.

45:03.840 --> 45:04.640
Meet Gloria.

45:05.200 --> 45:07.840
She was 22 years old when she passed away.

45:07.840 --> 45:09.600
She had high ambition to accomplish a lot of different-

45:09.600 --> 45:10.240
Happy holidays!

45:10.240 --> 45:11.360
Happy holidays.

45:11.360 --> 45:12.720
She had a high ambition to accomplish

45:12.720 --> 45:13.840
a lot of different things.

45:13.840 --> 45:16.000
She was an activist and often would protest

45:16.000 --> 45:18.160
against issues that she felt were unjust.

45:18.160 --> 45:19.360
I'm not sure how she died

45:19.360 --> 45:22.160
but she has strong willed, independent spirit.

45:22.160 --> 45:23.840
She will speak up when she sees someone lying

45:23.840 --> 45:25.440
or treating someone else badly or unfairly

45:25.440 --> 45:27.200
by slamming a door or turning her lights off

45:27.200 --> 45:28.080
to get your attention.

45:28.080 --> 45:30.160
I have heard her yell no before

45:30.160 --> 45:31.680
when she didn't like something.

45:31.680 --> 45:34.080
She will talk to you through a spirit board

45:34.080 --> 45:34.960
and in your dreams.

45:36.080 --> 45:38.160
She is a loving, compassionate spirit

45:38.160 --> 45:40.560
who really cares about what happens to others

45:40.560 --> 45:42.640
and will watch over you and your family

45:42.640 --> 45:44.400
with protection and care

45:44.400 --> 45:46.160
and will stick up for you when needed.

45:46.720 --> 45:49.920
Do you know how bad your self-confidence has to be

45:49.920 --> 45:51.120
for you to be like,

45:51.120 --> 45:53.120
don't let my doll hear you talking that way

45:53.120 --> 45:54.480
because she's got my back.

45:55.280 --> 45:55.780
Yeah.

45:55.780 --> 45:58.900
The doll itself is 16 inches high

45:58.900 --> 46:01.460
and has brown curly hair and blue eyes.

46:01.460 --> 46:04.180
She's wearing a beautiful dark blue velvet dress

46:04.180 --> 46:07.060
with white fuzzy trim and has a matching hat.

46:07.700 --> 46:11.380
She has bloomers, socks, and black boots.

46:11.380 --> 46:13.060
She is also holding a silver gift.

46:13.700 --> 46:16.180
Gloria will make a wonderful Christmas gift

46:16.180 --> 46:18.340
for you or someone you love.

46:20.340 --> 46:23.220
I don't know what is wilder.

46:23.220 --> 46:26.340
Or the idea that you would say,

46:26.340 --> 46:30.660
Merry Christmas, it's a doll with a dead activist inside.

46:30.660 --> 46:32.340
Or that you would say,

46:32.340 --> 46:35.620
Merry Christmas, me, surprise,

46:36.180 --> 46:38.980
I got you a haunted doll for yourself.

46:39.620 --> 46:41.780
Maybe you need someone who's gonna give you

46:41.780 --> 46:44.260
that little boost of self-confidence every day.

46:44.980 --> 46:45.700
Who's gonna be like,

46:46.340 --> 46:47.700
here's you like looking in the mirror

46:47.700 --> 46:48.340
and you're like,

46:48.340 --> 46:50.660
ugh, I don't wanna, I'm such a loser.

46:50.660 --> 46:52.580
And then you hear a door slam and you're like,

46:52.580 --> 46:55.060
hey, thank you, doll, you're right.

46:55.060 --> 46:57.140
You hear the doll yell, no!

46:58.500 --> 46:59.380
Is that what it sounds like?

46:59.380 --> 47:01.540
Can you imagine being anywhere at your house

47:01.540 --> 47:03.460
at any time of day with any number of people there

47:03.460 --> 47:05.460
with any level of security

47:05.460 --> 47:07.300
that you feel in your heart of hearts

47:07.300 --> 47:09.860
and just hearing yelled out loud, no!

47:10.500 --> 47:12.900
That's bad, that's bad, that's not good.

47:12.900 --> 47:15.060
What if a face cat did it, Griffin?

47:15.060 --> 47:17.140
Then I would know, I would expect it,

47:17.140 --> 47:18.180
I would anticipate it.

47:19.540 --> 47:22.180
Yeah, I mean, how is this doll boosting my self-confidence?

47:22.180 --> 47:23.300
Is it like a Teddy Ruxpin

47:23.300 --> 47:26.020
where it's got a cassette tape of Wilson Phillips' hold on in it?

47:26.020 --> 47:28.900
Because I could be for that, I could be all about that.

47:29.620 --> 47:31.780
It's just there is never gonna be another doll.

47:31.780 --> 47:33.700
Justin, you've jumped the fucking shark.

47:33.700 --> 47:35.700
You cannot shock me anymore with this segment

47:35.700 --> 47:38.740
after the very sexual, very sensual spirit.

47:38.740 --> 47:39.540
You can't do it anymore.

47:39.540 --> 47:42.740
Yeah, I'm gonna have to go back to the woodshed

47:42.740 --> 47:45.140
and chop up some of these dolls,

47:45.140 --> 47:46.180
glue them back together,

47:46.900 --> 47:49.860
and see if we can find something a little spookier

47:49.860 --> 47:51.300
than a sexual doll.

47:51.300 --> 47:53.060
The thing is that this doll,

47:53.060 --> 47:57.220
I just didn't know that dolls had seasons and trends.

47:57.220 --> 47:58.500
Because if you look at this doll,

47:59.940 --> 48:01.940
like its dress is blue,

48:01.940 --> 48:05.060
and it looks kind of like it has that frosted,

48:05.060 --> 48:06.740
kind of snow-like trim,

48:06.740 --> 48:09.380
and it's got like silver holly on it.

48:09.380 --> 48:12.580
And it's definitely a Yuletide haunted doll.

48:13.140 --> 48:14.260
A question for you.

48:15.220 --> 48:17.860
If you had this haunted doll that was very Christmassy,

48:17.860 --> 48:23.860
would you feel okay about packing it up

48:24.580 --> 48:26.420
10 and a half months out of the year?

48:26.420 --> 48:28.020
How would you feel about that?

48:29.460 --> 48:32.340
If this thing's yelling no in my house,

48:32.980 --> 48:37.540
I believe it will find itself packed up 12 out of 12 months.

48:37.540 --> 48:38.340
No, but-

48:38.340 --> 48:38.980
That's worse.

48:39.940 --> 48:43.140
I actually, I'm more okay with the doll randomly

48:43.140 --> 48:45.540
like from a shelf somewhere yelling no

48:45.540 --> 48:52.420
instead of yeah, for the ad, I just no, no, no, no, no, no.

48:52.420 --> 48:55.380
We're talking about maybe the most effective form

48:55.380 --> 48:57.860
of elf on the shelf imaginable.

48:57.860 --> 48:58.980
Because it's not just like,

48:58.980 --> 49:02.580
oh, don't steal a cookie because it's a sin, I guess,

49:02.580 --> 49:04.020
and the elf will tell Jesus

49:04.020 --> 49:07.700
and you won't get any presents or heavenly reward

49:07.700 --> 49:08.820
at the end of your life.

49:08.820 --> 49:13.140
You also have this doll as maybe backup for this elf

49:13.140 --> 49:15.140
who literally will chide the child,

49:15.140 --> 49:18.100
just chide them so good and so loud and so scary.

49:19.060 --> 49:22.740
Oh boy, it's kind of sad, this one.

49:23.380 --> 49:26.260
Oh no, I just got a sad doll.

49:26.260 --> 49:27.780
You know, I don't know.

49:32.900 --> 49:33.460
All right.

49:33.460 --> 49:35.060
I bummed myself out with this one

49:35.060 --> 49:36.580
because somebody is gonna buy themselves

49:36.580 --> 49:38.020
a haunted doll for Christmas.

49:38.020 --> 49:39.140
Oh yeah, yeah.

49:39.140 --> 49:41.060
That bums me out, I shouldn't have thought about that.

49:42.500 --> 49:44.900
Well, maybe it could be like a Christmas shoe situation.

49:44.900 --> 49:45.400
Ooh.

49:46.100 --> 49:50.660
And it's like if mama meets Jesus tonight

49:50.660 --> 49:54.100
and needs a ghost to guide her up the spiral pathway

49:54.900 --> 49:56.900
into the crystal heavens.

49:56.900 --> 49:59.060
If mama meets Jesus tonight,

49:59.060 --> 50:02.580
I wanna have a doll for her spirit to leap into.

50:02.580 --> 50:06.500
I'm channeling my mom's ghost into this special Christmas doll.

50:07.060 --> 50:10.980
Do they sell husks on eBay or is that just,

50:10.980 --> 50:14.340
can I go, if I go into any like American girl store,

50:14.340 --> 50:16.260
is it just Husk City, baby?

50:16.260 --> 50:16.820
Husk, Husk City.

50:16.820 --> 50:21.300
The way this population is expanding daily,

50:21.300 --> 50:24.820
we are soon going to have two designations,

50:24.820 --> 50:27.700
dolls and not haunted dolls.

50:27.700 --> 50:30.500
Those would be the two different things there are

50:30.500 --> 50:32.420
because it would be such a rarity to find

50:32.420 --> 50:34.500
one that doesn't have a ghost inside of it.

50:35.140 --> 50:37.220
Yeah, it's like trying to find an apartment.

50:37.220 --> 50:37.700
You know what I mean?

50:37.700 --> 50:38.660
You're gonna have to find a real,

50:38.660 --> 50:39.860
like when you die, you're like,

50:39.860 --> 50:40.900
I'd really like to,

50:40.900 --> 50:44.500
but I can't find an empty doll anywhere, Jesus.

50:44.500 --> 50:48.660
Yeah, this is how like Polly Pocket

50:48.660 --> 50:50.180
and all that shit came about.

50:50.180 --> 50:51.620
This is just sort of efficiency.

50:51.620 --> 50:53.460
Just that you get a big box full of Polly Pockets,

50:53.460 --> 50:56.500
you fit like, you know, 60,000 people in that one.

50:57.460 --> 50:58.900
You ever see that Matt Damon movie?

50:59.860 --> 51:01.700
Yep, it's awesome.

51:01.700 --> 51:04.260
He gets shrunk down and he gets put in a hell box

51:05.220 --> 51:06.980
full of just a bunch of writhing flesh.

51:06.980 --> 51:08.980
It's really, it's funny.

51:08.980 --> 51:09.540
It's a funny movie.

51:09.540 --> 51:11.780
Honey, I Shrunk the Matt, I believe it was called.

51:13.060 --> 51:15.860
Meet Matt, because he pilots a giant Matt Damon.

51:15.860 --> 51:17.460
Hey folks, that's going to do it for us

51:17.460 --> 51:18.820
for this episode of our podcast,

51:18.820 --> 51:19.780
My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

51:19.780 --> 51:23.700
We hope you've had a deliciously spooky time with us here.

51:24.260 --> 51:28.260
We would remind you, though, that you should please go vote.

51:29.300 --> 51:32.660
Please go vote, freaking people, please.

51:32.660 --> 51:35.220
Did I go vote? Did I go vote?

51:36.180 --> 51:37.700
Did you? Please go vote.

51:37.700 --> 51:42.740
So we got a mailing list that is going to get rolling here.

51:43.780 --> 51:46.900
The first one may have already gone out, possibly.

51:46.900 --> 51:47.780
Is that possible?

51:47.780 --> 51:51.060
May have, but you want to sign up for it.

51:51.060 --> 52:00.260
Go to bit.ly forward slash McElroy Mail, M-A-I-L.

52:00.260 --> 52:02.340
It's not a pyramid scheme.

52:02.340 --> 52:06.180
And a lot of people have been buzzing about that.

52:06.180 --> 52:08.020
I don't know who keeps saying that.

52:08.020 --> 52:10.260
It's not a pyramid scheme, just a regular mailing list.

52:11.540 --> 52:15.060
I also want to say, if you are anywhere near the Cincinnati area,

52:15.060 --> 52:17.300
I've got one of my Underground Society shows

52:17.300 --> 52:19.220
coming up November 16th.

52:19.220 --> 52:24.660
You can get tickets for that at bit.ly slash cus November 2018.

52:25.220 --> 52:26.740
We've got a lot of fun guests,

52:26.740 --> 52:29.460
and you can come out and hang out with a bunch of cool people,

52:29.460 --> 52:31.860
and you'll find out who the guests are once you get there

52:31.860 --> 52:34.260
and join the society or whatnot.

52:34.260 --> 52:36.180
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

52:36.180 --> 52:37.940
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

52:37.940 --> 52:39.700
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

52:39.700 --> 52:43.540
Fantastic song, fantastic album, good band, great band, great dude,

52:43.540 --> 52:44.900
good times, great oldies.

52:45.620 --> 52:47.540

How about a final Yahoo?

53:27.060 --> 53:27.620
Yes, please.

53:27.620 --> 53:29.060
It was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

53:29.060 --> 53:29.780
Thank you, Adrian.

53:29.780 --> 53:31.540
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user

53:31.540 --> 53:34.020
who I'm going to call Julian, who asks,

53:35.380 --> 53:39.620
if I can catch a scorpion, does it become my pet?

53:42.180 --> 53:43.220
My name is Justin McElroy.

53:43.220 --> 53:44.580
I'm Travis McElroy.

53:44.580 --> 53:46.180
I'm Griffin McElroy.

53:46.180 --> 53:47.460
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

54:11.380 --> 54:14.500
We've all made mistakes in book club, right?

54:14.500 --> 54:15.940
You drink a little too much.

54:15.940 --> 54:17.300
You don't actually read the book.

54:18.020 --> 54:20.420
And if you're under the bubble in Fairhaven,

54:20.980 --> 54:23.620
your individual will get subsumed by the collective.

54:23.620 --> 54:27.060
Hey, maybe I just let him go and whip us up some guac.

54:27.060 --> 54:28.980
We do not require guac.

54:28.980 --> 54:32.420
We require only nutrients and expansion.
