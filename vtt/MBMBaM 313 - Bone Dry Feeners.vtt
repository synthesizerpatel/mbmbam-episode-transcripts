WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:46.880
Hello, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the

00:46.880 --> 00:52.000
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.000 --> 00:59.360
Come that sweet, sweet sugary baby, Griffin McElroy. So stoked to be back in the McElroy

00:59.360 --> 01:05.920
Studios here after our trip to Boston, which was just a delight. You left an egg sandwich.

01:06.880 --> 01:12.080
You left two egg sandwiches just sitting here on this on the audio switchboard, Justin,

01:12.080 --> 01:16.320
and they've created a powerful stink in the hot summer sun. Now, to be fair, actually,

01:16.320 --> 01:21.200
it's melted into the soundboard and created its own little like biosphere kind of thing. It's

01:21.200 --> 01:26.000
really weird and gross. Now that was OK, that there was reasoning behind that. I did have a

01:26.000 --> 01:32.160
reason for that. I was worried that we would all be killed in Boston, perhaps, you know,

01:32.160 --> 01:37.200
purge 24-7. So that's why I put the sandwiches under glass. And if you look closely, you can

01:37.200 --> 01:43.920
see the little nameplate that says, as eaten by beloved my bim bam host, Justin McElroy,

01:43.920 --> 01:49.920
1980 to 2016. Yeah. Always rolling. You ate that sandwich for 36 years?

01:50.640 --> 01:54.080
Always riding. No, that's my life. He's really been savoring this bad boy.

01:54.080 --> 01:58.560
Yeah, it's like it's like, you know, how they turned Dolly Parton's childhood home

01:58.560 --> 02:04.480
into a Dollywood exhibit. And they just left all the old, old ass egg sandwiches that she'd

02:04.480 --> 02:09.200
taken single bites out of and then just let the hot, stinky summer sun just do they thing on

02:09.200 --> 02:10.640
these egg sandwiches. The best thing about-

02:10.640 --> 02:14.000
Well, they wanted to really give you what it was like to grow up in Dolly Parton's

02:14.000 --> 02:20.320
egg sandwich filled home. How sweet would it be if everything was exactly like it was like,

02:20.320 --> 02:25.280
this is how we grew up, y'all. It was just like this. And there was just like one giant stack of

02:25.280 --> 02:30.640
empty folded down Mountain Dew cartons. It was like, listen, we pounded the stuff. We're crazy

02:30.640 --> 02:36.800
for it. That was my childhood. Now, I hope nobody thinks I make a funny Dolly Parton. I fucking

02:36.800 --> 02:39.360
love Dolly Parton. Well, the voice was pretty insulting.

02:39.360 --> 02:43.920
It was insulting. Hey guys, it's me, Dolly Parton. I'm an idiot. That's basically what you were

02:44.480 --> 02:47.920
doing. I wrote Jolene. I'm a big, stupid idiot. Listen to my damn voice.

02:47.920 --> 02:52.800
I wasn't trying to- That sound was me farting. I'm Dolly Parton.

02:52.800 --> 02:58.160
Dolly Parton's more like it. Okay. Well, I'm not sure about any of that.

02:58.160 --> 03:01.600
I just want, I don't own that. I love Dolly Parton. That was Justin.

03:02.320 --> 03:07.840
That's how I sounded. The one, I've been working my voices lately.

03:07.840 --> 03:12.000
Yeah. Because I'm reading a lot of children's

03:12.000 --> 03:15.440
books and that really gives you a lot of chance to play and explore the space.

03:15.440 --> 03:18.480
Hell yeah. I've been reading this Mary Poppins book.

03:18.480 --> 03:22.720
That's about the one scene where they go to visit Uncle Albert, the guy who laughs and floats.

03:22.720 --> 03:32.960
You remember? So I am on one page floating between peak Mary Poppins, peak Julie Andrews,

03:34.080 --> 03:37.200
flowing- Can you give me a little bit of that sweet nectar?

03:37.200 --> 03:41.600
Hers is like, spit spot children, come along. That's actually really good.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.840
That's going to get some ASMR to people.

03:43.840 --> 03:49.920
And then I'm going to, and then I like effortlessly flow into bad cockney Dick Van Dyke.

03:49.920 --> 03:53.520
So he's like, you know, I had a story about my uncle. He's got this-

03:53.520 --> 03:55.360
That's actually too good, Justin. I'm sorry.

03:55.360 --> 04:00.640
He works at a pork factory and he spends all day making feces.

04:00.640 --> 04:01.200
There it is.

04:01.200 --> 04:05.120
Like flip, like a ninja over a back table, right into Edwin.

04:05.120 --> 04:08.480
It's like, I'm sorry, children. I just can't stop from laughing.

04:08.480 --> 04:09.040
Oh God, see that's my ass.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.840
What's the chuckles get to me? I start flying.

04:11.840 --> 04:17.120
That's my ASMR right there. The one that just kind of conflicts with like what my brain wants and need.

04:17.120 --> 04:19.840
It's kind of like a, kind of like a BDSMR.

04:19.840 --> 04:23.280
Or it's just like, you treat my ears so bad, so bad.

04:23.280 --> 04:26.000
So you didn't like, I thought it was like the first time-

04:26.000 --> 04:27.920
You never know how these voices are going to come out of you.

04:27.920 --> 04:30.720
Like, if you read any stories about- You guys will eventually read some books about-

04:31.760 --> 04:34.160
You guys will eventually read some books about Mickey Mouse.

04:34.160 --> 04:38.000
And you're going to find that you are doing a passable Minnie Mouse or Mickey Mouse.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.560
And then either Donald or Goofy will come on the scene.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.960
And it's just like, I don't- Here comes this.

04:44.000 --> 04:44.880
Can you give me a Donald?

04:44.880 --> 04:45.760
Yeah, I'll give you a Donald.

04:49.360 --> 04:50.720
My Donald is like this.

04:50.720 --> 04:54.720
I forgot to turn the lights off, Mickey. Sorry about that.

04:54.720 --> 04:58.080
I was going to say, my Donald is just going to be a terrible Gilbert Gottfried.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.840
And that's basically what you did as well.

04:59.840 --> 05:02.800
Does Charlie look at you when you do that, like you've disappointed her?

05:02.800 --> 05:05.360
Like, that's not Donald.

05:05.360 --> 05:06.480
Does she look on in fear?

05:06.480 --> 05:11.120
Because it sounds like that impression is being wrung out of you by a large man.

05:11.120 --> 05:14.080
Like Brock Lesnar is like kicked in the door to the nursery

05:14.080 --> 05:15.920
and just grabbed you by the ankle and neck

05:15.920 --> 05:18.960
and just wrung you until a Donald impression came out.

05:18.960 --> 05:20.320
Well, let me hit you with this.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.440
I'm sorry, children.

05:21.440 --> 05:24.160
I just start laughing and I float up to the ceiling.

05:24.160 --> 05:25.280
Is that Goofy or Ed Wynn?

05:25.280 --> 05:26.480
That's Ed Wynn. He's back.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.520
It does sound a lot better now compared to your Donald.

05:29.520 --> 05:31.360
Yeah, it makes it better by comparison.

05:31.360 --> 05:36.080
But yeah, I have no Donald. I have no Goofy.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.360
And does Charlie understand?

05:39.360 --> 05:41.200
I'm sorry, my child.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.280
I have no Donald or Goofy for you today.

05:43.280 --> 05:44.480
I have no Donald today.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.160
I have no Donald or Goofy today.

05:46.160 --> 05:49.040
We could wait until like a two or three in the afternoon

05:49.040 --> 05:51.600
when perhaps my instrument is more warmed up.

05:51.600 --> 05:54.240
I might be able to deliver you a passable Goofy.

05:54.240 --> 05:57.040
I've got to juice my diaphragm.

05:57.040 --> 05:59.680
It would be me sitting alone in a room,

05:59.680 --> 06:01.440
like talking to myself, like...

06:04.560 --> 06:05.920
See, that sounds good.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.920
The death rattle of Donald the Duck.

06:12.480 --> 06:14.800
That's Donald Duck choking on a Werther's original.

06:16.160 --> 06:19.280
It's very specific, but I think you all agree that I'm right.

06:20.160 --> 06:21.520
That's probably what it would sound like.

06:21.520 --> 06:28.880
Is this dad-ass humor going to be the only shit now?

06:28.880 --> 06:29.360
Do you think?

06:30.000 --> 06:31.680
I'm not knocking.

06:31.680 --> 06:36.720
I'm just saying, I think we're about to enter a new phase of just dad-ass.

06:36.720 --> 06:39.440
Do we have to start calling the show My Daddy, My Daddy, and Me?

06:40.000 --> 06:40.960
Three Daddies.

06:42.080 --> 06:42.880
Daddy alert.

06:42.880 --> 06:43.920
My Three Dads.

06:43.920 --> 06:45.520
There's a name for a podcast.

06:46.160 --> 06:47.120
Too Many Dads.

06:47.840 --> 06:48.880
Daddy Town.

06:48.880 --> 06:49.920
Here it is.

06:49.920 --> 06:51.600
Three Many Dads.

06:51.600 --> 06:52.000
Okay.

06:54.880 --> 06:57.520
We're a trio of smaller than average dads.

06:58.240 --> 06:59.360
Three Many Daddies.

06:59.360 --> 07:01.040
No, Many, M-A-N-Y.

07:01.840 --> 07:02.560
Many.

07:02.560 --> 07:03.120
Many.

07:03.120 --> 07:04.560
I actually like Justin's better.

07:04.560 --> 07:07.120
I would like us to be just smaller versions of ourselves,

07:07.120 --> 07:09.360
like a Travis at like a tenth of the scale,

07:09.360 --> 07:11.520
but I still have to deal with full-grown problems.

07:11.520 --> 07:12.080
Oh, sure.

07:12.080 --> 07:12.400
Yeah.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.520
Navigating the world.

07:13.520 --> 07:13.760
Yeah.

07:16.080 --> 07:17.280
We were going to talk about something else,

07:17.280 --> 07:19.760
but then we kind of went down another vein and I'm fine with it.

07:19.760 --> 07:21.120
Save the other intro for later.

07:21.120 --> 07:22.800
I gotta be honest, guys.

07:22.800 --> 07:25.360
When I saw Uncle Albert was in this book,

07:26.160 --> 07:29.920
I just had to open my mouth and just like fling my arms wide

07:29.920 --> 07:32.480
and just let myself fall like the guy

07:32.480 --> 07:34.720
from that Collective Soul video off the building,

07:34.720 --> 07:38.320
just hoping Edwin would catch me and shepherd me away.

07:38.320 --> 07:40.320
He's the Edwin beneath your wings.

07:40.320 --> 07:40.880
There it is.

07:41.440 --> 07:42.240
There it is.

07:42.240 --> 07:42.880
You found it.

07:44.720 --> 07:45.360
Question, Justin.

07:45.360 --> 07:48.240
Do you ever, when you're doing these books for your child,

07:48.240 --> 07:50.880
do you ever open your mouth and surprise yourself

07:50.880 --> 07:54.320
with how good you do at an impression you didn't know you could do before?

07:54.320 --> 07:54.560
Yeah.

07:54.560 --> 08:01.040
I'm saying exactly like it is literally bizarre to reach into you

08:01.040 --> 08:03.200
and figure out that there's an Edwin in there.

08:03.200 --> 08:03.440
Yeah.

08:04.160 --> 08:05.200
I've got an Edwin.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.040
I've got an Edwin in me somewhere.

08:10.080 --> 08:13.280
How about we do advice from other people or for other people

08:13.280 --> 08:14.880
and the questions are from other people.

08:14.880 --> 08:18.800
My roommate recently started bringing home mannequins for work

08:18.800 --> 08:20.560
and putting them around the house.

08:20.560 --> 08:23.120
He said he does this because he doesn't want them to get thrown out.

08:24.160 --> 08:27.600
At first I thought it was funny, but now we're completely overrun.

08:27.600 --> 08:33.760
We have five complete mannequins around seven half busts heads and legs.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.200
Three of the mannequins are children,

08:35.200 --> 08:38.800
which he dresses in wigs and refuses to let me dress in clothing.

08:38.800 --> 08:40.160
I'm starting to get freaked out.

08:40.160 --> 08:41.440
Should I get him to stop?

08:41.440 --> 08:43.040
How do I tell him he has a problem?

08:43.040 --> 08:45.200
Can I downsize the family without making him mad?

08:45.920 --> 08:47.680
That's from Overman and Mannequins.

08:47.680 --> 08:49.440
I want to take these questions in reverse order,

08:49.440 --> 08:52.320
hit you with the answer to that first one and it's a big no.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.160
You cannot.

08:54.160 --> 08:58.080
They are his mannequin babies and you have to leave them unscathed and unnamed.

08:58.720 --> 09:01.520
What if you took one of them away and told them that he had moved out?

09:02.400 --> 09:05.680
Like, oh, Derek and I had a big fight and he got his own apartment.

09:07.840 --> 09:08.240
That's an-

09:08.240 --> 09:09.440
Derek the Mannequin doesn't live here anymore.

09:09.440 --> 09:09.920
I'm sorry.

09:09.920 --> 09:13.280
That's a very expensive grift,

09:13.280 --> 09:16.160
because then you have to find a very flexible landlord

09:16.160 --> 09:19.280
that's willing to rent to you on the Jeep to a mannequin.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.080
So your roommate can go visit Derek?

09:22.080 --> 09:23.520
Yeah, no, I got an address.

09:23.520 --> 09:24.720
Fuck you, I made it up.

09:24.720 --> 09:26.240
Here's an address for him.

09:26.240 --> 09:26.960
Go visit them.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.640
My credit check was a son of a bitch.

09:31.200 --> 09:31.840
Here's the thing.

09:32.480 --> 09:36.080
The law of large numbers literally dictates

09:36.080 --> 09:39.280
that if you bring home enough mannequins from work,

09:39.280 --> 09:42.720
eventually one of them will be Kim Cattrall.

09:42.720 --> 09:43.280
Right.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

09:44.480 --> 09:45.440
Yeah, definitely.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.240
So like this, it sounds like they're taking a sort of scattershot approach

09:50.240 --> 09:52.000
to acquiring a Kim Cattrall.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.240
Because in the movie, which I have not seen,

09:54.240 --> 09:58.000
I think that they just like go from store to store until they find a Kim Cattrall.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.880
Your roommate is taking a weird way of doing it,

10:00.880 --> 10:05.040
just like planting Kim Cattrall seeds and hoping one of them blossoms.

10:05.040 --> 10:10.320
Okay, but question, is it going to be Kim Cattrall from Mannequin

10:10.320 --> 10:12.880
or will it be present day Kim Cattrall?

10:12.880 --> 10:17.760
I'm not sure I'm ready for all the double entendres

10:17.760 --> 10:20.400
that a modern day Kim Cattrall, like, hey, listen.

10:20.400 --> 10:23.200
Well, she wouldn't be playing her character from Sex and the City.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.800
Yeah, but she's a sexual woman.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.640
She's an awakened sexual woman.

10:26.640 --> 10:29.280
Wrote a book about sex and stuff, like she's down.

10:29.280 --> 10:32.400
Like, I don't like, I'm not sure I'm ready to be like,

10:32.400 --> 10:37.440
watching Whose Line Is It Anyway 2, The Rebirth.

10:37.440 --> 10:40.400
And from behind my shoulder here, like, listen,

10:40.400 --> 10:43.280
next time you're at the store, could you bring back some PVC

10:43.280 --> 10:45.760
so I can make a donker for the guy next to me?

10:45.760 --> 10:47.840
Because she loves the mannequin next to her.

10:48.880 --> 10:50.560
She wants some extra PVC.

10:50.560 --> 10:53.280
Make it long too, for his dick.

10:53.280 --> 10:54.880
I need to lay some pipe.

10:54.880 --> 10:55.840
If you know what I mean.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.320
And then she just sits there.

10:58.320 --> 10:59.200
And then she just sits there.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.040
We've watched a lot of Sex and the City.

11:01.040 --> 11:03.040
For like 11 minutes.

11:03.040 --> 11:05.440
Oh my god, law of large numbers.

11:05.440 --> 11:07.840
If you bring enough back, you're gonna get chemical trial.

11:07.840 --> 11:09.440
If you keep bringing them back,

11:09.440 --> 11:12.000
you're gonna get Jeff from Today's Special.

11:12.000 --> 11:12.960
Oh my god.

11:12.960 --> 11:14.560
It was a mannequin that only comes to life

11:14.560 --> 11:16.560
in this Canadian kids TV show where he puts a magic hat.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.080
That's never heard of bobby pins.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.120
You never hear of bobby pins.

11:19.120 --> 11:20.320
Can't keep that motherfucker on.

11:20.320 --> 11:22.320
People always trick it into taking it off

11:22.320 --> 11:23.440
and turn it back into a mannequin.

11:23.440 --> 11:25.040
People gotta say hocus pocus, alamagocus,

11:25.040 --> 11:26.320
and get that motherfucker back.

11:26.320 --> 11:28.320
But you can finally hook those two up.

11:28.320 --> 11:28.640
Yeah.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.320
They were meant to be together.

11:30.320 --> 11:33.440
Where's my extremely specific shipping?

11:33.440 --> 11:33.920
Yeah.

11:33.920 --> 11:34.640
Where is it?

11:34.640 --> 11:35.360
Tumblo?

11:35.360 --> 11:35.920
Tumblo?

11:35.920 --> 11:38.560
Where's my Jeff from Today's Special slash chemical trial?

11:38.560 --> 11:42.240
I would like to do a dark reboot of Today's Special

11:42.240 --> 11:44.800
where they have to trick him into getting the hat off

11:44.800 --> 11:46.000
before the store opens

11:46.000 --> 11:48.400
so he doesn't kill everyone that comes in.

11:48.400 --> 11:51.200
Yeah, because let's really address the facts if we can.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.000
Okay.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.520
This Today's Special mannequin

11:53.520 --> 11:55.520
is a ghost inhabiting the mannequin

11:55.520 --> 11:56.960
and the only reason the ghost exists

11:56.960 --> 11:58.640
is if they're killed in a terrible passion.

11:58.640 --> 11:59.840
Uh-huh.

11:59.840 --> 12:00.880
That's not accurate.

12:00.880 --> 12:04.480
He was turned into a mannequin by a wizard

12:04.480 --> 12:05.760
who gave him a magic hat.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.560
Wait, oh wait, hold on.

12:08.560 --> 12:12.000
Was he turned from mannequin to man or man to mannequin?

12:12.000 --> 12:12.880
Mannequin to man.

12:12.880 --> 12:14.160
That's why he has to learn so much.

12:14.160 --> 12:15.760
He doesn't know how to read and shit.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.520
Like he has to learn everything about the world

12:17.520 --> 12:19.680
hence like educational portion of the program.

12:20.560 --> 12:24.160
So Justin, if I may, if I may ask a disturbing question.

12:24.160 --> 12:24.400
Yeah.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.520
He is mannequin.

12:25.520 --> 12:25.680
Yeah.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.280
He is hollow as a mannequin.

12:27.280 --> 12:27.520
Yeah.

12:27.520 --> 12:28.960
When the hat is placed upon his head,

12:28.960 --> 12:29.840
as the magic words are said,

12:29.840 --> 12:31.840
does he suddenly fill up with organs?

12:31.840 --> 12:32.160
Yeah.

12:32.160 --> 12:33.360
And that's what's horrible.

12:33.360 --> 12:36.160
If you turn your TV all the way up, you fucking hear it.

12:36.880 --> 12:42.480
And it's like, listen, if you want a dark reboot,

12:42.480 --> 12:44.640
you're gonna have to go pretty dark

12:44.640 --> 12:48.960
because you are talking about a newborn fully grown man

12:48.960 --> 12:51.920
that spends half of his days in a prison of death.

12:51.920 --> 12:54.560
And also the night when Jody doesn't work.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.000
He's also in a prison of death.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
And PS, if Jody gets fired, he's locked in oblivion forever.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.040
So it's already shades of gray, I would say,

13:03.040 --> 13:04.480
in this children's selfish program.

13:04.480 --> 13:04.960
So I know-

13:04.960 --> 13:07.520
There's a lot of pressure put on Jody in this scenario.

13:07.520 --> 13:08.080
Yeah.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.600
So I know he can't read

13:09.600 --> 13:12.240
and every time they take his hat off, he dies.

13:12.240 --> 13:13.200
But can he fuck?

13:14.160 --> 13:15.520
Hi, it's me, mannequin.

13:15.520 --> 13:16.480
Get out of here.

13:16.480 --> 13:19.520
Hi, it's me, real mannequin, mannequin, the mannequin.

13:20.160 --> 13:20.880
From mannequin?

13:21.600 --> 13:22.480
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

13:23.200 --> 13:24.720
No, I want to talk about today.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.920
I want to keep addressing the issues with today's special.

13:27.920 --> 13:29.440
The security guard was a puppet.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.040
What if they made a sequel to Mannequin 2 called Ramekin?

13:36.960 --> 13:39.680
And it was about a little serving dish for a creme brulee.

13:40.560 --> 13:41.920
Did it come to life?

13:41.920 --> 13:43.440
Did it come to life?

13:44.000 --> 13:45.280
And then it was just-

13:45.280 --> 13:46.880
And it would just be a mouth.

13:46.880 --> 13:47.920
No, don't crack it.

13:47.920 --> 13:48.960
Oh, Jesus Christ.

13:48.960 --> 13:49.520
Don't, no.

13:50.480 --> 13:51.760
It's so hot.

13:51.760 --> 13:52.480
Kill me.

13:52.480 --> 13:53.280
Kill me.

13:53.280 --> 13:54.320
You're gonna blow too much.

13:54.320 --> 13:56.080
That's a sad short life right there.

13:56.080 --> 13:59.280
Filled with sweet cream, blow torched, cracked, and eaten.

14:00.160 --> 14:03.040
I heard a rumor about a one-day-old mannequin man

14:03.040 --> 14:06.080
that can really just give it to me.

14:06.080 --> 14:06.960
I'm a Ramekin.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.880
Where would it even go?

14:08.880 --> 14:10.480
We'll figure it out together.

14:10.480 --> 14:13.440
So this direct-to-video sequel is voiced by Kim Cattrall as well.

14:14.080 --> 14:14.580
Yes.

14:15.440 --> 14:18.320
It's a crossover between Mannequin and Look Who's Talking 3.

14:19.440 --> 14:22.480
Look Who's Talking 3, the babies are all Ramekins.

14:22.480 --> 14:26.080
There have gotta be nights where Jodie has to stock the shelves

14:26.080 --> 14:29.040
where she thinks to herself, like she goes to reach for the hat

14:29.040 --> 14:30.000
and she's like, you know what?

14:30.560 --> 14:31.840
I just can't tonight.

14:31.840 --> 14:33.040
I can't really tonight.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.240
I'm actually way behind.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.680
I have a lot of shit to do.

14:35.680 --> 14:40.000
I cannot spend my night tutoring this mannequin person.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.920
And then you go, okay, but that's bad

14:41.920 --> 14:45.360
because the next thing she goes, puts the hat on and he's like,

14:46.080 --> 14:48.720
Jodie, is it Thursday?

14:49.600 --> 14:52.080
Is time to watch Survivor?

14:52.080 --> 14:52.720
Oh, no.

14:52.720 --> 14:53.360
Oh, God.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.800
It's not time to watch Survivor.

14:56.080 --> 14:58.320
Oh, because you always work Thursdays.

14:59.520 --> 15:02.000
Is it Jodie Donnelly's Wednesday?

15:05.280 --> 15:06.640
I'm so scared, Jodie.

15:06.640 --> 15:06.960
Please.

15:06.960 --> 15:12.000
The good thing is that a super horned-up Kim Cattrall

15:12.000 --> 15:15.360
just smashes in through the front window like,

15:15.360 --> 15:15.840
Scree!

15:18.000 --> 15:19.040
Oh, God.

15:19.040 --> 15:22.880
See, this is why I don't put the hat on you every day.

15:22.880 --> 15:26.400
I have to be in touch with the store manager at the Macy's

15:26.400 --> 15:28.960
down the street to make sure we don't bring you guys to life

15:28.960 --> 15:29.760
at the same time.

15:31.760 --> 15:32.960
They can't breed.

15:32.960 --> 15:33.680
Oh, God.

15:33.680 --> 15:34.640
They cannot breed.

15:34.640 --> 15:35.760
This is so important.

15:35.760 --> 15:36.800
Hey, Jeff, listen.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.400
Just for me this one time, take the hat off.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.160
No, I really can't.

15:42.160 --> 15:43.840
I can't, definitely can't do that.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.360
Kimakin, I can't do that.

15:45.360 --> 15:46.560
I can't do it, Kimakin.

15:47.520 --> 15:47.920
Please.

15:47.920 --> 15:51.120
Please love me for who I am, a beheaded man.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.080
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

15:52.640 --> 15:53.760
Yeah, for sure.

15:53.760 --> 15:54.720
Got a Yahoo here.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.160
And this one was sent in by Morgan Davey.

15:56.160 --> 15:56.880
Thank you, Morgan Davey.

15:56.880 --> 15:59.200
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Vladimir.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.120
All caps, Vladimir asks,

16:02.640 --> 16:06.880
I invented a bag that serves two main purposes.

16:07.520 --> 16:09.920
Would like to pick the name for my project.

16:09.920 --> 16:13.280
What do you guys think of name 50-50 bag?

16:15.040 --> 16:15.360
What?

16:15.360 --> 16:17.200
Okay, what's that?

16:17.200 --> 16:20.880
I've really reached down into the depths of the imagisphere

16:21.520 --> 16:24.320
and I've pulled out an idea nugget

16:24.320 --> 16:26.240
for a bag that serves two purposes.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.280
Would like to pick the name for the project.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.520
Thinking about going with 50-50 bag.

16:32.480 --> 16:33.120
What could it?

16:33.680 --> 16:35.280
It's a bag, Justin.

16:35.280 --> 16:35.600
Okay.

16:36.240 --> 16:37.600
Yeah, I've had bags.

16:37.600 --> 16:38.560
This is you.

16:38.560 --> 16:39.680
This is you.

16:39.680 --> 16:43.120
Get bag, open bag, fill bag with pencils.

16:44.000 --> 16:44.960
Closed bag.

16:44.960 --> 16:45.680
A pencil bag.

16:45.680 --> 16:46.480
It's for one purpose.

16:46.480 --> 16:47.040
It's a pencil bag.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.240
This is my pencil bag.

16:48.240 --> 16:48.960
Right.

16:48.960 --> 16:53.440
You open up another bag and you put a bunch of cans of soda pop in it.

16:53.440 --> 16:54.800
This is my soda pop bag.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.960
And then this is you going to school.

16:56.960 --> 16:57.760
I have two backpacks.

16:57.760 --> 16:58.400
I'm an idiot.

16:59.600 --> 16:59.840
Right?

17:00.480 --> 17:00.960
Right.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.640
There's no better way, Griffin.

17:04.080 --> 17:09.520
Think about your life and think about how inconvenient travel is in your life.

17:10.160 --> 17:13.520
And then think about being able to sort of cut your travel weight

17:13.520 --> 17:16.960
in half with this totally cool 50-50 bag.

17:16.960 --> 17:21.440
Okay, so you're saying it's a bag that I could put more than one different kind of thing in?

17:22.080 --> 17:23.520
It serves two purposes.

17:23.520 --> 17:24.720
That's against the law, I thought.

17:24.720 --> 17:26.880
But aren't you worried about cross-contamination?

17:28.240 --> 17:29.600
I mean, you don't want to put...

17:30.560 --> 17:31.360
You're right, Travis.

17:31.360 --> 17:34.080
There's certain things that just can't go in the 50-50 bag.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.480
Raw meat can't go in the 50-50 bag.

17:36.480 --> 17:36.720
No.

17:36.720 --> 17:37.520
It simply can't.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.080
Can I tell you guys a secret?

17:40.080 --> 17:40.800
Yeah.

17:40.800 --> 17:44.960
While Griffin was asking the question, I was distracted thinking about the name Vladimir,

17:44.960 --> 17:49.520
and I thought that a really great name for a bong would be Vlad the Inhaler.

17:49.520 --> 17:51.280
Yeah, that would be a very good name for a bong.

17:51.280 --> 17:52.160
You're right, Travis.

17:52.160 --> 17:55.280
Normally, I would scold you for such a diversion, but that's an excellent name that I hate to lose.

17:55.280 --> 17:56.640
No, but you did a great job, Travie.

17:56.640 --> 17:57.200
I hate to lose that to you.

17:57.200 --> 17:57.600
Thank you.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.880
It was a real...

18:00.640 --> 18:04.240
It really got stuck in my brain, and I had to let it freeze

18:04.240 --> 18:06.560
so that I could free myself from this brain prison.

18:06.560 --> 18:07.120
Thank you.

18:07.120 --> 18:07.920
It's good.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.320
Let me posit this.

18:10.320 --> 18:14.320
It's a bag that doesn't just store two things, because that's fucking crazy.

18:14.320 --> 18:14.560
Right.

18:15.360 --> 18:22.720
It's a bag that stores things and then does a completely second thing.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.960
So you can put your pencils and soda in it.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.000
Yes, of course.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.320
I was being silly earlier when I insisted that you needed separate bags for those things.

18:30.960 --> 18:35.440
So you can put your soda and your pencils and your push pops and your diaphragms

18:35.440 --> 18:37.360
and all that stuff in them, right?

18:37.360 --> 18:42.640
But then there's a second thing that it does, and maybe that second thing is it

18:44.480 --> 18:46.880
makes soft serve ice cream or something.

18:48.560 --> 18:54.720
It could double as maybe like a boombox or an umbrella or something practical.

18:54.720 --> 18:58.800
Boombox would seem easy because speakers are like...

18:58.800 --> 19:01.200
They'll put speakers in anything today, you know?

19:02.000 --> 19:04.160
And Bluetooth, don't get me started.

19:04.160 --> 19:07.680
None of us are really sure what it is or what it does.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.280
Or how it works.

19:09.280 --> 19:14.800
I have that button on my car and sometimes I push it and the word no appears on the car.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.880
So I'm still not sure what Bluetooth is or does.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.800
But what if the bag could do two things?

19:20.800 --> 19:24.960
So one thing would be I put my stuff in it and I get on the airplane

19:24.960 --> 19:29.680
and then I pick my bag up and I put it on my lap and my bag is a Game Boy Advance.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.160
Okay, okay.

19:32.160 --> 19:35.280
What if you're traveling and you put like...

19:35.280 --> 19:39.600
Everybody's got to take a suitcase these days with them on the plane.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.760
Can't have any liquids in there, sorry.

19:41.760 --> 19:43.440
Or take them out, up to you.

19:44.000 --> 19:49.920
And printed on the bag as you get onto the plane is your boarding pass.

19:50.560 --> 19:54.000
Your bag can show your boarding pass.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.360
That's pretty worthwhile.

19:55.360 --> 19:59.200
What if it's a bag and it's also a bong called Vlad?

19:59.200 --> 20:02.640
That's really good.

20:02.640 --> 20:03.440
Yeah, it's good.

20:03.440 --> 20:04.160
Can you think about that?

20:05.440 --> 20:07.040
You know like a camelback, right?

20:07.040 --> 20:13.040
But instead it's like a bong and the tube runs up through the strap of the bag

20:13.040 --> 20:16.160
and you just like take a little Vlad the inhale off of it.

20:16.160 --> 20:16.800
So what if you...

20:17.440 --> 20:21.360
It's a bummer that one of the two functions that this Justin Timberlake,

20:21.360 --> 20:26.880
the 50-50 Experience bag has to have is carrying things.

20:26.880 --> 20:29.760
Because that's wasting like one function of what I would want it to do.

20:29.760 --> 20:33.440
I would rather have a bag in which you could not store things,

20:33.440 --> 20:35.280
but it would count as your boarding pass

20:35.280 --> 20:43.920
and also you could smoke that good, good green dust to reduce anxiety on a plane.

20:43.920 --> 20:45.200
That's what this thing needs to be.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.920
I don't have anything in this bag.

20:47.920 --> 20:53.840
However, it is constantly displaying pornography on the outside mesh of the bag

20:53.840 --> 20:56.160
and not still images, moving images.

20:56.160 --> 20:57.440
Where's that technology?

20:57.440 --> 20:59.360
Apple or Google or Amazon.

21:00.800 --> 21:05.760
And then the second function that it does is it just like gets you really high very fast.

21:07.120 --> 21:10.880
You know those helmets that have the two beer cans and then you drink from them?

21:11.760 --> 21:14.640
Doesn't that seem to be a waste to have both of those be beer?

21:15.840 --> 21:16.640
You know what I mean?

21:16.640 --> 21:20.560
What if the other one was a water bong and then you go to board

21:20.560 --> 21:22.960
and they're like, time to board, group four.

21:22.960 --> 21:27.040
And you stroll up and you're like, did you say group 420?

21:27.040 --> 21:30.400
And then you pound them both at the same time and they try to stop you.

21:30.400 --> 21:33.520
And then you're like, show me in a book where this is illegal.

21:34.720 --> 21:35.600
They can't.

21:35.600 --> 21:40.000
They can't because there's no rule that says I can't have my 420 hat on.

21:41.680 --> 21:44.320
Then they have to make one and then we have to stay ahead of the game.

21:44.320 --> 21:45.360
I hate drug.

21:45.920 --> 21:50.320
I wish it could be just like ranch and buffalo wings.

21:50.320 --> 21:55.200
And the buffalo wing straw would have to be very big.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.640
Or liquefied.

21:56.640 --> 21:57.840
Maybe it's a little blender.

21:57.840 --> 22:02.080
Maybe it's a little magic bullet that you put boneless or bonad wings into

22:02.080 --> 22:04.640
and right before you're ready to consume you just blast them.

22:04.640 --> 22:05.120
Yeah.

22:05.120 --> 22:10.080
What if you had a bag that was a blender and everything you put into it just got blended

22:10.080 --> 22:10.560
together?

22:11.440 --> 22:15.840
And then the other and then but it also is constantly displaying pornography on the outside.

22:15.840 --> 22:16.240
Yes.

22:16.240 --> 22:17.600
And boarding passes.

22:17.600 --> 22:20.640
And everyone in the pornography has a boarding pass that it's yours.

22:22.400 --> 22:26.240
And you could never control if it was going to display a boarding pass or pornography.

22:26.240 --> 22:28.400
It just happened at random and you just had to hope.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.160
Sir, you've been standing here 11 minutes.

22:30.160 --> 22:30.480
I know.

22:30.480 --> 22:31.360
Just wait a second.

22:31.360 --> 22:32.000
OK, please.

22:32.720 --> 22:33.600
It's going to pop up.

22:33.600 --> 22:34.560
Where you been going?

22:35.840 --> 22:37.600
It's illegal for you to ask me that question.

22:39.280 --> 22:40.960
Just sit back and enjoy the show.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.160
Can you please, Gnark?

22:43.440 --> 22:44.400
I can't hear.

22:44.400 --> 22:45.680
They can't hear the dialogue.

22:45.680 --> 22:46.640
They can see out.

22:46.640 --> 22:48.480
Well, it's one of those bags.

22:49.920 --> 22:50.880
Wait, hold on.

22:50.880 --> 22:52.720
It's a two way pornography screen?

22:52.720 --> 22:55.360
It's a two way pornography screen.

22:55.360 --> 22:57.200
Are you guys enjoying this?

22:57.200 --> 22:57.760
How do you feel about this?

22:57.760 --> 22:59.040
We're doing this for you.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.000
We don't like this.

23:02.080 --> 23:08.000
It's a pornography backpack where people can it's but it's they can see out and see you

23:08.000 --> 23:09.840
through the screen of the pornography.

23:09.840 --> 23:11.120
And it's also a jet pack.

23:11.120 --> 23:13.520
So I kind of fly around Johnny Appleseed style.

23:13.520 --> 23:15.440
But then I don't there's nothing in it.

23:15.440 --> 23:17.760
I can't put anything in the daggone thing.

23:17.760 --> 23:20.400
This dog, this dog gone thing.

23:22.160 --> 23:25.600
There is nothing more unnerving than a two way pornography screen.

23:25.600 --> 23:29.520
Even if they played it cool, when you boot up, you know there's going to be a reaction

23:29.520 --> 23:31.040
like, oh, there he is.

23:31.040 --> 23:33.120
Let's do it again.

23:34.240 --> 23:35.120
What's up, Michael?

23:35.680 --> 23:36.960
Back again for more, huh?

23:37.680 --> 23:38.800
All right, you wild dog.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.720
Here's your bespoke pornography.

23:42.640 --> 23:43.440
All right, Michael.

23:43.440 --> 23:46.240
Looks like you're waiting in line at a security checkpoint at an airport.

23:46.240 --> 23:47.840
Hi, all of Michael's new friends.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.040
Hey, everybody.

23:49.040 --> 23:49.760
Hey, everybody.

23:49.760 --> 23:50.800
This is Michael's thing.

23:50.800 --> 23:55.440
We're all going to be characters from Supernatural, except we talk with really high pitched voices.

23:55.440 --> 23:56.400
That's his thing.

23:56.400 --> 23:57.040
Here we go.

23:57.600 --> 24:02.080
My partner does a thing where they will sometimes pronounce words in the British way, even though

24:02.080 --> 24:04.800
99% of the way they speak is with an American accent.

24:04.800 --> 24:06.000
But here's the catch.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.720
Their mom is British and their dad is American.

24:08.720 --> 24:12.080
And they spent most of their time growing up in the US, but they insist on pronouncing

24:12.080 --> 24:15.280
words like herb with a hard H.

24:15.280 --> 24:16.800
Oh, looks like, did you do that on purpose?

24:16.800 --> 24:20.640
Okay, it's impossible to like tell whether or not you did that on purpose.

24:20.640 --> 24:22.960
I read ahead a little bit with a hard H.

24:22.960 --> 24:23.920
I'm professional.

24:23.920 --> 24:28.400
I feel like they ought to go all in one way or another, but what do you think?

24:28.400 --> 24:31.280
And that's from going loony in Las Vegas.

24:32.640 --> 24:40.320
The great thing about the American language, and by which I meant accent, is that much

24:40.320 --> 24:43.520
like America itself, it's a melange of beautiful dialects.

24:43.520 --> 24:44.560
Sure, yeah, yeah.

24:44.560 --> 24:46.640
It's why I think it's the most beautiful language.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.200
Language of love, they say.

24:49.200 --> 24:50.240
The language of love.

24:51.680 --> 25:01.280
So what you need to understand is if this person went either 100% American or 100% British,

25:02.400 --> 25:07.440
in both cases, the things that they said would be completely unintelligible.

25:07.440 --> 25:11.520
Mm-hmm, because 100% American would just be like,

25:16.000 --> 25:17.600
and 100% British would just be like-

25:17.600 --> 25:19.760
Did you just sing Return to Innocence?

25:19.760 --> 25:23.120
And then the 100% British would just be like,

25:27.360 --> 25:29.280
and you need the mix in there.

25:29.280 --> 25:30.960
Sure, you need the melange.

25:30.960 --> 25:39.040
You need the melange, or else it's just- The question is the blend.

25:40.000 --> 25:44.400
Because if your partner does this, yeah, we had some leftovers,

25:44.400 --> 25:47.280
so we wrapped it up in the aluminum foil.

25:50.160 --> 25:52.640
You gotta feather the edges, you know what I mean?

25:52.640 --> 25:57.520
But I could see where like, if your mom said herb, and then that's the way you heard it,

25:57.520 --> 26:02.480
like you just wanted to say herb, you're right.

26:02.480 --> 26:03.920
You could say that, right?

26:03.920 --> 26:04.720
You could.

26:04.720 --> 26:06.160
Yeah, that's fine, right?

26:06.160 --> 26:08.320
Yeah, I get a lift.

26:08.320 --> 26:09.280
I get a lot of- That's what I'm saying.

26:09.280 --> 26:10.960
If you're not drawing attention to it,

26:10.960 --> 26:14.800
if you're not doing like the, I spent a semester in France,

26:14.800 --> 26:18.320
and so now I pronounce French words all hoity-toity,

26:18.320 --> 26:21.920
if you're saying it because that's how you learned to say it, I think it's okay.

26:21.920 --> 26:28.800
Okay. 100% French would be like-

26:28.800 --> 26:31.520
Yeah, it would sound like someone was waking you up at three in the morning,

26:31.520 --> 26:33.280
and you had to try to get up off a waterbed.

26:33.280 --> 26:36.640
That's what- Sounds like a motorcycle in a glass jar.

26:36.640 --> 26:37.120
Exactly.

26:37.120 --> 26:39.440
I'm not making fun of these languages, by the way.

26:39.440 --> 26:45.840
New Zealand would be like- I'm just saying you need the other mix in there

26:45.840 --> 26:48.800
to produce the fucking consonant noises.

26:48.800 --> 26:54.080
It's like music, if Skrillex just did bass, it would be unintelligible.

26:54.080 --> 26:58.800
If he just did treble, if he just did jazz trumpet.

26:58.800 --> 26:59.760
Hey guys, I'm Skrillex.

26:59.760 --> 27:02.640
Here's my new song, and I'm just moving in a new direction.

27:02.640 --> 27:03.520
It is all treble.

27:04.960 --> 27:06.240
It's called Keep It Easy.

27:08.560 --> 27:09.040
Here we go.

27:09.920 --> 27:13.360
Time to, well, I was gonna say rock with this.

27:13.360 --> 27:17.200
And here's my new style, and it's just all fat bass drops.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.520
Oh shit, you're all skeletons. How did that happen?

27:21.360 --> 27:26.080
So even full bass Skrillex sounds like full treble Skrillex?

27:26.800 --> 27:27.680
I thought that was an identity.

27:27.680 --> 27:29.040
Well, the band doesn't change.

27:29.040 --> 27:32.080
His fucking voice wouldn't change, you dumb idiot.

27:32.080 --> 27:33.440
Of course it wouldn't, just the music.

27:37.200 --> 27:40.080
The one that fucks me up about this is country names.

27:40.960 --> 27:45.040
Imagine when we were at Mexico, and we're like, so how do you say it?

27:45.040 --> 27:48.560
And they're like, Mexico? And you're like, I don't think so.

27:49.680 --> 27:53.200
We're gonna go ahead and just go full crackers on it.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.040
Go ahead and get that X in there, it's fun.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.320
Isn't it Mexico?

27:56.320 --> 27:58.320
You guys can steal it if you want.

27:58.320 --> 27:59.200
No, we're good.

27:59.200 --> 27:59.840
No, we're good.

27:59.840 --> 28:01.200
Like the way we say it is good.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.680
We're just gonna stick with Mexico, if that's okay.

28:05.440 --> 28:08.240
I've always thought about that, when those countries have their own name,

28:08.240 --> 28:12.400
but there's English versions of their name.

28:12.400 --> 28:15.840
Like, we should just say their name the way it's pronounced.

28:15.840 --> 28:16.720
That's what I'm saying.

28:16.720 --> 28:20.080
That's what, yes, that is the, yeah, that's what I'm saying.

28:20.080 --> 28:23.120
Who was the person that came up with the different language names

28:23.120 --> 28:24.320
for the different places?

28:24.320 --> 28:28.400
Because like, Japan is Nihon, in the Japanese style, right?

28:28.400 --> 28:29.840
But we just call it Japan.

28:29.840 --> 28:31.680
And who was just like, what's this one called?

28:31.680 --> 28:34.160
Japan, nailed it, crushed it, next one.

28:34.160 --> 28:35.520
Next country.

28:35.520 --> 28:36.720
Next country, please.

28:38.080 --> 28:41.040
Okay, this one's Zealand, and there's a smaller one next to it.

28:41.040 --> 28:43.440
That's New Zealand, because I just learned about it.

28:43.440 --> 28:44.000
Moving on.

28:44.720 --> 28:46.400
It's new in my idiot brain.

28:47.760 --> 28:49.200
New, I'm idiot.

28:49.200 --> 28:52.640
Maybe it's punishment for, because we have a lot of people coming from England,

28:52.640 --> 28:54.880
and like, they had so many country names there.

28:54.880 --> 28:56.000
Like, what's your country called?

28:56.000 --> 28:57.920
Uh, it's called a lot of things, Gov.

28:57.920 --> 29:01.280
It's like, UK, and Britain, and England.

29:01.280 --> 29:02.080
Get it together, guys.

29:02.080 --> 29:02.960
Just pick a name.

29:02.960 --> 29:04.560
Some people just call it Europe.

29:04.560 --> 29:07.520
Some people call it London, which is like, buck, buckwild.

29:07.520 --> 29:08.880
But it's crazy.

29:08.880 --> 29:12.480
It's crazy that that's not what the American one, like, that one didn't stick.

29:12.480 --> 29:15.600
Your country's called London now, because we make the rules.

29:15.600 --> 29:17.360
We're in charge here.

29:19.040 --> 29:26.000
You're called, um, Tokyo's house, because it's where Tokyo lives.

29:26.960 --> 29:28.400
I think we did a pretty good job.

29:28.400 --> 29:33.360
It's called Tokyo's butt crib, and it comes on 8pm every Wednesday on MTV3.

29:34.560 --> 29:37.120
It's just about Tokyo just trying to get by, you know?

29:37.120 --> 29:37.840
Just trying to make it.

29:37.840 --> 29:39.360
Trying to find their way.

29:39.360 --> 29:42.240
Preview for season two, he gets a baby!

29:43.680 --> 29:44.800
And then it's a literal crib.

29:46.000 --> 29:46.960
Oh, I see.

29:46.960 --> 29:48.800
Yeah, it works on a lot of levels.

29:48.800 --> 29:53.840
Uh, hey, why don't we take a quick break from the fun to visit the Money Zone?

29:53.840 --> 30:10.000
I wish this character that we invented in that last bit could have been on the old

30:10.000 --> 30:12.480
We're in the World with Carmen Sandiego show.

30:12.480 --> 30:16.480
To just be like, um, Scotland's Hat.

30:16.480 --> 30:17.520
What are you talking about?

30:19.440 --> 30:20.480
It's in Scotland's Hat!

30:21.600 --> 30:22.640
Africa Island!

30:22.640 --> 30:23.920
Do you mean Madagascar?

30:26.000 --> 30:27.520
What are you talking about?

30:27.520 --> 30:28.800
The island of Africa!

30:28.800 --> 30:29.360
Off it!

30:29.360 --> 30:31.520
Off of Africa.

30:31.520 --> 30:32.400
Tiny Africa!

30:33.040 --> 30:33.680
Our dick!

30:33.680 --> 30:34.720
It's Florida.

30:34.720 --> 30:35.200
I'm done.

30:36.720 --> 30:41.280
Listen, if you like wine but don't know as much about it as you'd like to, we have the

30:41.280 --> 30:42.560
perfect solution for you.

30:42.560 --> 30:44.560
It's called Club W.

30:44.560 --> 30:48.480
It is a service where you can tell them the kind of flavors you like.

30:48.480 --> 30:49.520
You don't tell them types of wine.

30:49.520 --> 30:52.640
You tell them, you know, how do you like your meat cooked?

30:52.640 --> 30:54.560
How do you like berries or chocolate?

30:54.560 --> 30:56.480
Like dark flavors, light flavors, whatever.

30:56.480 --> 30:59.680
And they're going to pick the wines that are going to match your palette.

31:00.800 --> 31:01.680
You know what I like about it?

31:01.680 --> 31:02.560
Tell me, Travis.

31:02.560 --> 31:06.640
When they send it to you, they send it to you with a card that describes the wine and

31:06.640 --> 31:09.520
not only describes the wine, like describes what you might pair it with or what kind of

31:09.520 --> 31:09.920
event.

31:10.480 --> 31:14.960
And it's never like fancy events that you like can't relate to.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.600
It's like, oh, having pizza and watching a football game.

31:17.600 --> 31:18.880
This is a good wine for that.

31:18.880 --> 31:21.040
And it's like, oh, OK.

31:21.040 --> 31:23.440
That's like a thing that I actually wanted to know.

31:23.440 --> 31:24.480
Thank you very much.

31:25.440 --> 31:31.600
They'll tell you which, like when you put a canister of the Club W wine into your 50-50

31:31.600 --> 31:36.640
bag hat, it'll tell you what to put in the other half of it to like combo the flavors.

31:36.640 --> 31:40.000
So like maybe you want like a Panda Express orange chicken.

31:40.800 --> 31:43.680
60% cacao, bittersweet chocolates.

31:43.680 --> 31:45.200
Yeah, it's good stuff.

31:45.200 --> 31:50.320
Right now, Club W is offering our listeners $20 off your first order when you go to clubw.com

31:50.320 --> 31:51.360
slash my brother.

31:51.360 --> 31:52.480
And it gets even better.

31:52.480 --> 31:53.520
You don't want to pay for shipping.

31:53.520 --> 31:58.080
So Club W will actually cover your shipping on orders of four bottles or more.

31:58.080 --> 31:59.680
So take something off your to-do list.

31:59.680 --> 32:04.000
Go to clubw.com slash my brother and get $20 off your first order now.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.440
That's clubw.com slash my brother.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.440
Can I tell you about Harry's?

32:10.080 --> 32:10.800
Oh, yeah.

32:11.840 --> 32:12.400
Let me start off.

32:12.400 --> 32:14.160
Before I tell you about Harry's, I'm going to set the backstage.

32:14.160 --> 32:15.680
Oh, God, why do you tease us like this?

32:15.680 --> 32:17.360
It's so important for an advertisement.

32:18.240 --> 32:22.400
The current way that most stores do razors is bullshit and garbage,

32:22.400 --> 32:24.080
and they should be ashamed of themselves.

32:24.080 --> 32:25.200
I'm talking about you, Walgreens.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.560
I'm talking about you, CVS.

32:26.560 --> 32:27.520
Probably talking about you, Walmart.

32:27.520 --> 32:28.640
I got my eye on you.

32:28.640 --> 32:30.480
Talking about you, Fruth Pharmacy.

32:30.480 --> 32:31.680
Fruth Rite Aid.

32:32.400 --> 32:33.920
You, shame on you.

32:34.880 --> 32:36.480
Your Dwayne's Reed.

32:36.480 --> 32:42.720
They lock their razors in plexiglass cases like the razors are common criminals or perhaps

32:42.720 --> 32:46.720
Pokemon trapped in Pokeballs, and when you stop to think about it, it's because those

32:46.720 --> 32:50.800
razors cost $140 each, and people are just going to steal them just so they can have

32:50.800 --> 32:52.720
a clean, smooth face or legs or whatever.

32:54.000 --> 32:59.360
Harry's, it cuts out the middleman, cuts out all the bad stuff in the process of getting

32:59.360 --> 33:02.560
these razors onto your face or legs.

33:02.560 --> 33:05.920
These are quality German-engineered five-bladed cartridges.

33:05.920 --> 33:10.000
Give you a close, comfy shave, and you'll get a full refund if you're not happy,

33:10.000 --> 33:12.560
and you get factory direct prices.

33:12.560 --> 33:14.240
That's how they get them to you so cheap.

33:14.240 --> 33:18.080
Harry's Truman Starter Set is a great option for new customers, and it's an amazing deal.

33:18.080 --> 33:22.000
For just $15, you get a razor handle, you get moisturizing shave cream, you get three

33:22.000 --> 33:25.840
of Harry's five-blade German-engineered razors, and the best part is they're going to give

33:25.840 --> 33:27.680
our listeners five bucks off their first purchase.

33:27.680 --> 33:34.080
Just go to harys.com, harys.com, and use the promo code MYBROTHER, all one word.

33:34.080 --> 33:37.680
That's harys.com, and use the promo code MYBROTHER.

33:37.680 --> 33:42.000
All right, can I, as long as we're asking if we can do things, can I read a Jumbotron

33:42.000 --> 33:42.480
message?

33:42.480 --> 33:44.240
I wish you would.

33:44.240 --> 33:44.800
Thank you.

33:44.800 --> 33:47.360
This is for Colton and Taylor.

33:47.360 --> 33:50.080
It's from Jeremy Quinn and Lonnie.

33:50.080 --> 33:52.240
Congratulations on marrying each other.

33:52.240 --> 33:56.880
Colton, don't pee in Taylor's closet unless she's into that.

33:56.880 --> 33:58.560
Then you keep doing you.

33:58.560 --> 34:01.680
Taylor, if you didn't know about that before, you do now.

34:01.680 --> 34:02.800
Have a great marriage.

34:03.760 --> 34:05.280
A lot to unpack here.

34:05.280 --> 34:06.640
Yeah, but here's what I want to unpack.

34:06.640 --> 34:09.520
Their preferred time frame for this message is late July.

34:10.320 --> 34:13.520
We sunk it from downtown.

34:13.520 --> 34:15.920
Hell yeah, great timing, Jeremy Quinn and little Lonnie.

34:15.920 --> 34:20.480
But that means that this message has been sitting on the shelf for a few months, and

34:20.480 --> 34:29.360
at this point, I think Taylor knows all about Colton's dark secret vis-a-vis closet piss.

34:29.360 --> 34:32.080
No, we have to assume that they just got married, right?

34:32.720 --> 34:35.680
Oh, that's possible, and they didn't, okay.

34:35.680 --> 34:36.480
Okay.

34:36.480 --> 34:39.760
That would be a weird thing otherwise.

34:39.760 --> 34:45.360
Like, they're getting married in February, but we want to hold it out a little bit.

34:45.360 --> 34:49.360
We want to let it really soak in, like the urine on the closet carpet.

34:49.360 --> 34:52.720
You're going to get married in February, but we're going to piss shame you late summer.

34:53.920 --> 34:54.800
Catch it.

34:54.800 --> 34:55.920
Catch the piss shame.

34:56.720 --> 34:57.760
Sweep in the nation.

34:57.760 --> 34:58.880
So happy marriage.

34:58.880 --> 35:05.120
I want to tell everybody about the Up for Discussion podcast on iTunes and SoundCloud.

35:05.120 --> 35:12.000
It is a brilliant audio experience for your ears, where a panel of genius babies discuss

35:12.000 --> 35:16.560
current affairs, past affairs, pasta affairs, pop culture, rock vultures, and everything

35:16.560 --> 35:22.080
important for the whole world, hosted by Tim Blase of Acapella Science and his two-way

35:22.080 --> 35:26.640
funnier but less famous friends, Tom and Simon.

35:26.640 --> 35:33.200
That's called Up for Discussion, and it is available on iTunes and also SoundCloud.

35:33.200 --> 35:37.440
I heard that on the new episode they got Wayne Brady.

35:38.400 --> 35:39.760
Damn, that's a big get.

35:41.360 --> 35:43.200
But not that Wayne Brady.

35:43.200 --> 35:43.760
Okay.

35:43.760 --> 35:44.560
Oh, okay.

35:44.560 --> 35:45.040
Okay.

35:45.040 --> 35:46.240
Wayne S. Brady.

35:47.120 --> 35:49.680
Wayne Dwayne Brady.

35:49.680 --> 35:54.320
He does improv, but he's, like, so bad at it.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.760
So super bad at it.

35:55.760 --> 36:00.640
And so, like, really, this is an intervention that the Up for Discussion podcast has with

36:00.640 --> 36:01.760
Wayne the Dwayne Brady.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.440
So that's going to be a big episode.

36:03.440 --> 36:31.920
Just search iTunes for Up for Discussion, and you can start enjoying it right now.

36:33.520 --> 36:39.520

36:49.680 --> 36:50.000
Do it.

36:51.520 --> 36:52.400
I got a Yahoo here.

36:52.400 --> 36:55.520
This one was sent in by game recognized game Rachel Rosen.

36:55.520 --> 36:56.080
Thank you, Rachel.

36:56.080 --> 36:58.080
It's by Yahoo Answers user anonymous.

36:58.080 --> 37:09.760
We'll call them... Evil Wayne Brady asks, how do they film a movie inside a movie?

37:11.840 --> 37:14.240
For example, the movie Scream 3.

37:14.960 --> 37:19.280
They were filming a movie inside of the movie called Stab 3, I believe.

37:19.840 --> 37:21.120
God, I hope that's not true.

37:22.080 --> 37:26.240
I have not seen the third Scream, but I hope they did not film a movie inside of it called

37:26.240 --> 37:30.480
Stab 3. I wondered how they do...

37:31.280 --> 37:32.400
How do they do that?

37:33.040 --> 37:38.240
The house they used in the movie production Stab 3 was the house from the first Scream

37:38.240 --> 37:38.800
franchise.

37:38.800 --> 37:39.600
How is it done?

37:41.280 --> 37:43.920
Stab 3 Return to Woodsboro is the name of the film.

37:44.480 --> 37:45.040
Fuck.

37:45.040 --> 37:45.920
Wow, what a bad...

37:45.920 --> 37:47.120
Wow, what a bad thing.

37:48.000 --> 37:52.320
I mean, Scream 3 seems like a bad title in like a vacuum.

37:52.320 --> 37:58.000
To be fair, Grav, I also imagine they were trying to do the bad horror movie in the horror

37:58.000 --> 37:59.200
movie thing.

37:59.200 --> 38:01.520
But this isn't like bad campy horror movie.

38:01.520 --> 38:05.120
This is like if they called Superman Fly.

38:06.240 --> 38:06.640
Punch.

38:07.200 --> 38:07.920
Punch.

38:07.920 --> 38:08.720
Punchman.

38:08.720 --> 38:09.840
Punch flyer.

38:09.840 --> 38:12.560
No, because that's two verbs.

38:12.560 --> 38:12.800
Okay.

38:13.680 --> 38:15.200
This is a single one.

38:15.200 --> 38:18.080
Hey, have you seen that new movie?

38:18.080 --> 38:18.560
Drive.

38:19.600 --> 38:20.640
Okay, that works.

38:20.640 --> 38:21.200
That tracks.

38:21.200 --> 38:22.560
Crash.

38:26.560 --> 38:27.520
Flight.

38:27.520 --> 38:28.240
I could go on.

38:29.360 --> 38:30.400
So how do they...

38:30.400 --> 38:31.920
But it's a good question, I think.

38:32.480 --> 38:32.880
Because...

38:32.880 --> 38:34.000
How do you make the movie...

38:34.000 --> 38:35.120
So like you're making a movie.

38:35.120 --> 38:36.240
Okay, I'm making Tron.

38:36.880 --> 38:37.680
Okay.

38:37.680 --> 38:39.040
They don't make a movie in that one.

38:39.040 --> 38:40.240
I'm making a movie, right?

38:40.240 --> 38:40.880
I'm making...

38:42.160 --> 38:44.320
What's a movie where they make the movie?

38:44.320 --> 38:46.240
Oh, um...

38:46.240 --> 38:47.680
Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.

38:47.680 --> 38:49.440
Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.

38:49.440 --> 38:49.680
Yeah.

38:49.680 --> 38:51.920
And they're in there and they're telling so many boner jokes

38:51.920 --> 38:53.120
and I'm fucking loving it.

38:53.680 --> 38:55.760
But then I see them making a movie inside the movie

38:55.760 --> 38:58.400
and I'm like, how did they do it?

38:59.440 --> 38:59.840
How do they do it?

38:59.840 --> 39:01.600
It's all about inventing backstory.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.840
Because you have to create in the world,

39:03.840 --> 39:05.680
you have to create a studio that's gonna make that movie.

39:05.680 --> 39:07.440
You gotta create somebody who's the head of that studio.

39:07.440 --> 39:08.720
What's his family like?

39:08.720 --> 39:09.440
How did he get there?

39:09.440 --> 39:10.000
What led him?

39:10.000 --> 39:11.760
Where did he go to school to get his film degree?

39:11.760 --> 39:12.640
You know what I mean?

39:12.640 --> 39:14.880
You gotta go all the way back or no one's ever gonna believe

39:14.880 --> 39:16.080
that they're actually making that movie.

39:16.080 --> 39:17.600
Okay, think about this for a second.

39:17.600 --> 39:20.080
Here's the weirdest thing about making a movie in a movie, okay?

39:20.880 --> 39:23.440
You have to get other cameras, right?

39:23.440 --> 39:24.000
That's fine.

39:24.720 --> 39:26.400
That's fine and expected.

39:26.400 --> 39:31.120
But like, you're gonna have to cast people to be the guy.

39:31.120 --> 39:35.680
Like, you know the guy who holds the boom mic is kind of like,

39:35.680 --> 39:39.120
you know, I could just be in the movie.

39:40.800 --> 39:43.760
We need you to hold the boom mic over the guy holding the boom mic.

39:43.760 --> 39:45.520
We need you to hold the boom mic over that guy.

39:45.520 --> 39:47.600
It's like, okay, why don't we just trade?

39:48.240 --> 39:52.480
Like, I can show him how to hold it and I'll be in it.

39:52.480 --> 39:54.400
That's how Craig T. Nelson got his start.

39:55.200 --> 39:55.840
Oh, really?

39:56.480 --> 39:57.760
Yeah, he was the best boy.

39:58.800 --> 40:01.440
And then he was like, what do best boys do?

40:01.440 --> 40:02.480
And everybody's like, I don't know.

40:02.480 --> 40:04.320
I think it's just like a good luck thing.

40:04.320 --> 40:07.280
And then Craig T. Nelson, who was like 16 at the time,

40:07.280 --> 40:10.960
knee high to a frog was just like, wait, you're telling me there's a position.

40:11.600 --> 40:13.920
Hold on, everybody stop shooting.

40:13.920 --> 40:15.280
Stop production on the movie.

40:15.280 --> 40:16.960
Stop the production on Gone with the Wind.

40:17.600 --> 40:20.960
Okay, so if I'm to be understood, there's a position,

40:20.960 --> 40:22.560
and this is all Craig T. Nelson.

40:22.560 --> 40:24.880
There's a position on film production.

40:24.880 --> 40:26.160
I assume you do more of a voice.

40:26.160 --> 40:27.680
There's a, he's 16.

40:27.680 --> 40:32.240
There's a position in film production called best boy.

40:32.960 --> 40:35.520
And it's just a boy who's very lucky

40:35.520 --> 40:37.920
and they keep him there to ward off evil movie spirits?

40:38.480 --> 40:39.280
Yeah, that's right.

40:40.320 --> 40:41.280
This place is haunted.

40:41.280 --> 40:44.880
Greta Garbo's just up in here haunting the place the fuck up.

40:44.880 --> 40:46.240
And you got to keep her away from us,

40:46.240 --> 40:48.320
Craig T. Nelson with his good luck boy charms.

40:51.040 --> 40:54.800
Anyway, to be fair, it did turn out just to be old man McGillicuddy,

40:54.800 --> 40:56.400
who was trying to drive away the movie studio

40:56.400 --> 40:58.560
so he could open back up his amusement park.

40:58.560 --> 41:00.880
But then he did die and started to haunt the place.

41:00.880 --> 41:02.880
And Craig T. Nelson was the only one that could stop him.

41:02.880 --> 41:04.560
Anyway, somebody was like, Craig T. Nelson,

41:04.560 --> 41:07.680
I love your style and I love your passion.

41:07.680 --> 41:09.280
I want you to be in my poltergeist.

41:10.320 --> 41:11.840
Then that's how it happened.

41:11.840 --> 41:12.720
And he was like, I don't know.

41:12.720 --> 41:15.360
That sounds like it's going to be a ghostly film.

41:15.360 --> 41:17.840
And they're like, yeah, that's exactly why we need you for this.

41:17.840 --> 41:19.280
That would be a fun job interview.

41:19.280 --> 41:21.440
Like, Craig T. Nelson, how can you prove

41:21.440 --> 41:24.400
that you're a very lucky boy whose ghosts are afraid of?

41:24.400 --> 41:26.400
It's like, hey, listen, I'm 60 years old.

41:26.400 --> 41:27.840
I haven't gotten killed by a ghost yet.

41:27.840 --> 41:30.640
So I got a pretty good track record going.

41:30.640 --> 41:31.520
He makes a good point.

41:35.040 --> 41:36.400
Those are all the people in the room agreeing.

41:39.840 --> 41:40.880
They're also from Australia.

41:40.880 --> 41:42.240
That's why they sound like that.

41:42.240 --> 41:44.960
Craig T. Nelson is basically a human chain letter.

41:44.960 --> 41:45.460
OK.

41:46.400 --> 41:52.960
Where if you don't kiss him, you'll die within one day.

41:52.960 --> 41:55.440
Within seven days, if you don't kiss Craig T. Nelson

41:55.440 --> 41:57.760
and you see him, but you don't kiss him,

41:57.760 --> 41:59.360
it's like not forwarding a chain letter.

41:59.360 --> 42:00.560
And it's bad, bad luck.

42:00.560 --> 42:02.640
Do you have to keep coming back to kiss him?

42:02.640 --> 42:05.200
Or is it just like, upon seeing him,

42:05.200 --> 42:06.720
you have 24 hours to kiss him?

42:07.280 --> 42:08.160
Yes, exactly.

42:09.920 --> 42:11.360
Well, you really said the first half of that

42:11.360 --> 42:13.040
and then just leapt off the building, huh?

42:13.040 --> 42:14.720
Just hoping Edwin would be there to catch you.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.520
Oh, I don't know if you're talking to me or Travis.

42:17.520 --> 42:19.120
We both said some really dumb shit just then.

42:20.480 --> 42:21.600
Here's another question.

42:21.600 --> 42:24.080
I'm a rock climber, and I got a lot of friends that climb, too.

42:24.640 --> 42:25.920
Well, they're great friends.

42:25.920 --> 42:28.480
I don't exactly trust them all to belay me.

42:29.360 --> 42:31.520
Oh, that means basically catch me if I fall.

42:31.520 --> 42:32.400
And just say that.

42:33.040 --> 42:36.240
God, these people sometimes.

42:36.240 --> 42:39.040
So I think, isn't belay where they're on like the other end

42:39.040 --> 42:40.000
of the rope and they're going like this?

42:40.000 --> 42:42.320
Yeah, so they're holding the rope that you are hanging from.

42:42.320 --> 42:44.080
They're not just standing under you,

42:44.080 --> 42:45.440
like waiting to catch you.

42:45.440 --> 42:46.320
Oh my God, I just-

42:46.320 --> 42:48.880
I have a bunch of skinny ass little boned friends

42:48.880 --> 42:50.720
that I will absolutely destroy.

42:50.720 --> 42:53.760
I just understood like half the lines in Terra Nova better.

42:53.760 --> 42:54.260
Cool.

42:54.880 --> 42:56.640
How do I keep my friends?

42:58.160 --> 43:00.320
Okay, they seem to find it offensive

43:00.320 --> 43:02.800
when I tell them I don't want them to belay me.

43:02.800 --> 43:04.080
How do I keep my friends

43:04.080 --> 43:06.160
without having to worry about getting dropped?

43:06.160 --> 43:07.840
And that's from living on the edge

43:07.840 --> 43:09.040
and hopefully staying that way.

43:09.040 --> 43:11.040
You definitely shouldn't let them belay you

43:11.040 --> 43:13.040
after you've offended them by telling them

43:13.040 --> 43:14.240
that you don't want them to belay you.

43:14.240 --> 43:17.200
Oh yeah, no, this ship has definitely sailed at this point,

43:17.200 --> 43:19.760
but if you were to have come to us before,

43:19.760 --> 43:21.680
you told all your friends that they're weak.

43:21.680 --> 43:23.040
They're fucking so weak.

43:23.040 --> 43:24.400
You can't control this.

43:24.400 --> 43:26.160
You can't control this rock climbing girth.

43:26.160 --> 43:28.400
I'm like a bull running up that mountain.

43:28.400 --> 43:29.200
You can't control this.

43:29.200 --> 43:30.160
It's so funny to me.

43:30.160 --> 43:32.240
You went with strength, didn't trust them.

43:32.240 --> 43:35.200
And I went with like shady character, didn't trust them.

43:35.200 --> 43:35.680
Yeah.

43:35.680 --> 43:38.080
Like maybe this is like a soap opera scenario

43:38.080 --> 43:40.800
where they're trying to like steal your,

43:40.800 --> 43:43.280
I don't know, oil drilling empire

43:43.280 --> 43:44.960
and maybe also your wife.

43:44.960 --> 43:47.760
And so they might let you drop in a climbing accident,

43:47.760 --> 43:50.080
but then it turns out that you have steel bones.

43:50.080 --> 43:52.560
So you survive and a witch doctor heals you,

43:52.560 --> 43:54.400
but now you're played by a different actor.

43:54.400 --> 43:55.680
Like that kind of thing.

43:55.680 --> 43:56.240
Interesting.

43:56.240 --> 43:56.720
You know.

43:56.720 --> 43:59.760
I'm surprised you guys don't think reverse psychology

43:59.760 --> 44:01.520
is like a pretty good way to go here.

44:01.520 --> 44:04.640
Like telling people that they're weak babies

44:04.640 --> 44:07.520
and like they could never contain your climbing prowess

44:07.520 --> 44:10.160
seems like a pretty good way to get people to hold on

44:10.160 --> 44:11.840
for the ride of their lives, you know?

44:12.560 --> 44:12.800
Yeah.

44:12.800 --> 44:14.800
The problem is you can't really test it.

44:14.800 --> 44:16.960
You can't be like, hold on, I'm going to jump.

44:16.960 --> 44:18.080
We'll see how you do.

44:18.080 --> 44:19.440
This will be your test run.

44:20.400 --> 44:20.640
Yeah.

44:20.640 --> 44:23.280
But that's every person who's ever carried you, right?

44:23.280 --> 44:25.680
Like you got to, at some point, it's an act of faith.

44:27.520 --> 44:28.000
You got to-

44:28.000 --> 44:28.720
That's beautiful, Justin.

44:29.840 --> 44:33.840
See, this is why I only make big, strong, dependable friends.

44:33.840 --> 44:34.080
Sure.

44:34.080 --> 44:38.000
Yeah, I go out with my friends and people like look at us

44:38.000 --> 44:41.600
like we're shooting the new sequel, The Magic Mike,

44:41.600 --> 44:44.160
all with different actors like Tokyo Drift style

44:45.120 --> 44:48.800
because we're just all so big and fucking strong and dependable.

44:49.600 --> 44:50.160
They depend-

44:50.160 --> 44:52.080
Because the two things don't matter without each other.

44:52.080 --> 44:54.720
They have to be built like fucking bulls

44:55.280 --> 44:58.960
and as dependable as a bull would be.

44:58.960 --> 45:01.600
But in every group, Griffin, there has to be a weakest one.

45:01.600 --> 45:03.600
So you have to have to, like they can't be like,

45:03.600 --> 45:05.040
like they can't all be equally strong.

45:05.040 --> 45:05.600
Yeah, that's me.

45:05.600 --> 45:07.040
That's obviously me.

45:07.760 --> 45:10.400
So then how do you feel when like Beefy Greg says like,

45:10.400 --> 45:12.080
I don't want Griffin to belay me.

45:12.080 --> 45:14.720
I feel fine about that because I'm probably off catching Pokemon.

45:16.880 --> 45:19.440
Enjoying some watercress sandwiches in the middle.

45:19.440 --> 45:20.400
How do you not understand, Travis,

45:20.400 --> 45:23.200
that that is the fucking dream scenario for-

45:23.200 --> 45:27.200
It's like being in the person in the front of a back massage chain.

45:27.200 --> 45:30.960
Like I don't have to hold up these massive fucking beefcakes

45:30.960 --> 45:34.400
that I go climb in with and real climbers

45:34.400 --> 45:36.000
really pronounce the B in the middle there.

45:36.000 --> 45:36.720
They're really in it.

45:37.280 --> 45:39.040
Well, you were raised by British people.

45:39.040 --> 45:41.520
I think that this is a good point, Griffin,

45:41.520 --> 45:43.200
because I think our question asker is,

45:43.760 --> 45:46.080
I personally, if my friend said,

45:46.080 --> 45:48.000
you don't have to do the thing.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.200
You don't have to be responsible for my health and well-being.

45:51.200 --> 45:52.960
You can just like sit there and have a beer.

45:52.960 --> 45:53.920
I'd be like, yes.

45:54.480 --> 45:56.720
This is exactly what I was hoping you would say.

45:56.720 --> 45:58.720
I don't want to be responsible for your life.

45:58.720 --> 46:01.040
That is not heat I need.

46:01.040 --> 46:02.880
I want to talk about something

46:02.880 --> 46:04.800
that is underneath the surface of all this,

46:04.800 --> 46:05.920
and it'll be a brief diversion,

46:05.920 --> 46:07.360
but I do want to touch on it.

46:07.360 --> 46:07.920
And this is the-

46:07.920 --> 46:08.560
Racism.

46:08.560 --> 46:10.160
It's a decision to go rock climbing.

46:13.360 --> 46:15.840
No, it's a decision to go rock climbing in the first place.

46:16.880 --> 46:20.080
Who is looking at the world and thinks,

46:20.080 --> 46:21.360
you know what I need from my life?

46:21.920 --> 46:23.040
Scarier.

46:23.040 --> 46:26.320
I would like it to be scarier on a daily basis.

46:26.320 --> 46:29.120
I would like it to be scarier and up more.

46:29.120 --> 46:31.760
Up more, like a higher?

46:31.760 --> 46:33.200
Now if it's like practice, we're like,

46:33.200 --> 46:34.800
listen, I'm going to need to get out of here.

46:34.800 --> 46:36.320
I'm going to need to get out of here quick.

46:36.320 --> 46:38.080
And so the additional methods of getting out of here

46:38.080 --> 46:39.440
may not be available to me.

46:39.440 --> 46:40.480
I'm into that.

46:40.480 --> 46:41.520
That's fine.

46:41.520 --> 46:43.120
That I would also allow you

46:43.120 --> 46:45.120
if you wanted to start learning how to do the suction cup thing

46:45.120 --> 46:47.040
with climbing up tall buildings like that.

46:47.040 --> 46:47.840
I'm into that too.

46:47.840 --> 46:50.720
If it's a method of egress and you're training yourself,

46:50.720 --> 46:51.280
that's fine.

46:52.880 --> 46:55.360
But you're saying people who look at the Matterhorn are like,

46:55.360 --> 46:56.400
I want to fuck that.

46:56.400 --> 46:58.560
You're like, I don't want to fuck that.

46:58.560 --> 47:00.240
I'd rather not fuck that today.

47:00.800 --> 47:02.560
Not at this juncture.

47:03.280 --> 47:06.400
I hate walking up steps for many reasons.

47:06.960 --> 47:08.320
One is tiring.

47:08.320 --> 47:11.120
And two, if I slip and fall and die on the steps,

47:11.120 --> 47:12.080
it's not a good look.

47:12.800 --> 47:15.040
But I will say, Justin, there is something about like,

47:15.040 --> 47:16.480
if you're going to slip and fall,

47:16.480 --> 47:19.360
falling off a mountain, not a bad way to go.

47:19.360 --> 47:22.160
I mean, it's at least cooler than falling down steps.

47:22.160 --> 47:24.400
Well, yeah, because you deploy that fucking wing suit

47:24.400 --> 47:28.080
on your way down.

47:28.080 --> 47:28.640
Hell yeah.

47:29.680 --> 47:31.040
Can you belay yourself?

47:31.920 --> 47:33.920
Yeah, you can if you get a rib removed.

47:43.440 --> 47:45.040
Um, how about another question?

47:47.840 --> 47:48.720
Oh, you like that one?

47:48.720 --> 47:51.040
It's a tasty one more.

47:51.040 --> 47:54.080
Um, do the one above the break.

47:54.080 --> 47:57.520
Okay, when there is only a little bit of chip dip left

47:57.520 --> 47:59.520
in the container, I'll sometimes crush chips up

47:59.520 --> 48:01.520
and make it into like a Frito pie.

48:01.520 --> 48:03.680
Alternatively, if there are only chip crumbs left,

48:03.680 --> 48:05.120
I'll mix them up with a bit of dip.

48:05.120 --> 48:06.240
Okay, we're talking.

48:06.240 --> 48:09.120
Okay, my wife, I get it.

48:09.120 --> 48:10.720
My wife thinks it's disgusting.

48:10.720 --> 48:11.440
Am I good?

48:11.440 --> 48:13.280
That's from Munch Squad Goals in West Texas.

48:14.720 --> 48:17.440
I do like that it's Munch Squad Goals in West Texas

48:17.440 --> 48:20.800
because this like, this person works at Whataburger

48:20.800 --> 48:22.480
and has listened to Munch Squad and it's like,

48:22.480 --> 48:24.000
it's time for me to get bold.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.840
It's time for this brand to get bold.

48:25.840 --> 48:26.960
Here's my new thing.

48:26.960 --> 48:29.440
Dip leavens topping for burgers.

48:29.440 --> 48:32.720
Okay, in defense of this person,

48:33.760 --> 48:35.760
what else are you supposed to do with the shit?

48:35.760 --> 48:36.960
You pay for it.

48:36.960 --> 48:38.160
It's food.

48:38.160 --> 48:39.680
Why wouldn't you consume it?

48:39.680 --> 48:40.400
It is food.

48:41.280 --> 48:42.480
Yeah, it's food.

48:42.480 --> 48:43.680
It's good mood food.

48:44.800 --> 48:47.040
Okay, you get to the bottom of the tortilla chip bag

48:47.040 --> 48:50.080
and it's not just like dust, but the chips are so small

48:50.080 --> 48:52.720
that like you can't get a good scoop going.

48:52.720 --> 48:53.360
Yeah.

48:53.360 --> 48:54.640
What are you supposed to do?

48:57.360 --> 49:00.000
I mean, you're supposed to like blast your like proboscis

49:00.000 --> 49:01.440
down there and just like sweep up,

49:01.440 --> 49:03.280
but that's ghoulish too.

49:04.480 --> 49:05.120
I do like that.

49:05.760 --> 49:08.160
Hey, do you guys, when you're at the bottom of a pretzel bag,

49:08.160 --> 49:11.440
do you guys ever up end it and just like ride the salt way?

49:11.440 --> 49:12.720
Oh, just punish yourself?

49:12.720 --> 49:15.280
Just huff that sack.

49:15.280 --> 49:16.320
Just huff the sack?

49:16.320 --> 49:18.560
Oh, this is so upsetting, this question is.

49:18.560 --> 49:19.120
I don't know why I did it.

49:19.120 --> 49:20.160
I don't think so at all.

49:20.160 --> 49:21.600
You eat it with a spoon.

49:21.600 --> 49:23.600
It's like salsa cereal.

49:23.600 --> 49:25.520
Oh my God, holy shit.

49:26.160 --> 49:26.960
That's so gross.

49:26.960 --> 49:29.280
That's the grossest way you could have said it.

49:29.280 --> 49:30.320
Why is that gross?

49:30.320 --> 49:32.320
You pour milk over your Cheerios?

49:32.320 --> 49:33.920
You pour salsa over your chips?

49:35.520 --> 49:38.240
Listen, I understand where your mental roadblock is,

49:38.240 --> 49:41.200
but ideologically, it's the same thing.

49:41.200 --> 49:43.600
Whether you scoop the chip or you eat it with a spoon,

49:43.600 --> 49:45.360
it's the same thing.

49:45.360 --> 49:50.400
Don't let your old world ideas of how the chip and dip experience

49:50.400 --> 49:52.560
is supposed to go stop you.

49:52.560 --> 49:54.800
Like with a spoon, you don't get it all over your feeners.

49:54.800 --> 49:56.640
You're not going to drop it on your shirt.

49:56.640 --> 49:57.920
Your feeners?

49:57.920 --> 49:58.800
On your feeners.

49:58.800 --> 50:00.080
You're not going to get it on your shirt.

50:00.080 --> 50:03.040
It's going to be a lot smoother of a process with a spoon.

50:03.040 --> 50:07.840
I don't know why you're letting your archaic understanding-

50:07.840 --> 50:11.600
You're not going to get it on your feeners?

50:11.600 --> 50:13.760
I've got salsa on my feeners.

50:13.760 --> 50:15.920
I've got chip crumbles-

50:15.920 --> 50:19.280
I've got chip crumbles on my food rags.

50:19.280 --> 50:22.720
Young Darryl Dawkins licked those feeners at the dinner table.

50:22.720 --> 50:26.720
I left my feeners stuck in the guacamole till you could get

50:26.720 --> 50:30.000
some prune and you got to wipe them off on my food rags.

50:30.000 --> 50:31.600
I got mole on my feeners.

50:31.600 --> 50:33.520
Got mole on my feeners again.

50:35.040 --> 50:36.320
Got it on my good jersey.

50:37.760 --> 50:40.000
I got to wipe the guacamole on my jersey.

50:41.520 --> 50:42.800
Got it on my feeners.

50:42.800 --> 50:44.240
Get these feeners clean.

50:47.760 --> 50:48.320
Feeners.

50:49.120 --> 50:52.800
Okay, so first off, before we wrap up here,

50:52.800 --> 50:55.440
we wanted to remind you that we are selling an expansion

50:55.440 --> 50:58.240
of the card game Man- Monikers, not Manikers.

50:58.240 --> 50:58.960
That's a different thing.

51:00.800 --> 51:01.920
It's a card game mannequin.

51:02.800 --> 51:03.520
Here's how it works.

51:03.520 --> 51:06.400
You collect five mannequins and it happens.

51:06.400 --> 51:07.440
You kill your roommates.

51:08.400 --> 51:11.600
You have got, as of listening to this, 16 days left to preorder

51:11.600 --> 51:13.520
this for just $10 and that's it.

51:13.520 --> 51:16.480
After you preorder it, that is all we're doing

51:16.480 --> 51:17.920
for the time being.

51:17.920 --> 51:19.360
That's all we're planning on doing, I should say.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.280
Manikers is a game that's sort of like

51:21.280 --> 51:22.640
an elevated form of charades.

51:22.640 --> 51:24.240
We've all played it and thought it was hysterical

51:24.240 --> 51:25.760
long before we agreed to do this.

51:26.640 --> 51:28.800
And so we decided to make our own expansion.

51:28.800 --> 51:31.120
It's based on all the different shows that we make

51:31.760 --> 51:33.200
with cards based on everyone,

51:33.200 --> 51:34.480
mostly my brother and me.

51:35.360 --> 51:38.480
But there's a lot of general interest cards in there

51:38.480 --> 51:41.040
of things that you don't have to listen to the show to get.

51:41.040 --> 51:43.840
So if you wanna play with other people,

51:44.560 --> 51:45.520
you'll be able to.

51:45.520 --> 51:47.440
That'll be even easier if you preorder it

51:47.440 --> 51:50.320
with the Manikers itself for 35 bucks.

51:50.320 --> 51:52.640
And then there's a ton of things that have nothing to do

51:52.640 --> 51:54.160
with our dumb show whatsoever.

51:54.160 --> 51:54.880
But it's so fun.

51:54.880 --> 51:58.000
It's like, it is my favorite party game to play.

51:58.000 --> 52:02.000
It is a dependable party game that like takes

52:02.000 --> 52:04.800
what is fun about charades and makes it even better.

52:04.800 --> 52:06.560
And it's all about like teamwork and memory

52:06.560 --> 52:08.320
and just making an ass of yourself.

52:08.320 --> 52:09.840
It's really, really, really great.

52:09.840 --> 52:13.680
And we hand wrote the text on all the different cards

52:13.680 --> 52:15.360
and there's gonna be art on some of them

52:15.360 --> 52:16.480
that should be really cool.

52:16.480 --> 52:18.720
And we're super excited about it.

52:18.720 --> 52:20.960
And you've only got 16 days and then that's it.

52:22.080 --> 52:25.280
We are not selling them like as a product afterwards.

52:25.280 --> 52:26.720
We're only doing pre-orders.

52:26.720 --> 52:28.080
So please, please do not sleep.

52:28.720 --> 52:32.560
A portion of sales that will go to an organization

52:32.560 --> 52:35.440
called Grow, which is based in Huntington.

52:35.440 --> 52:37.760
And they're doing urban farming to help people

52:37.760 --> 52:40.240
who are in addiction recovery to give them another place

52:40.240 --> 52:41.840
to sort of focus their energies.

52:41.840 --> 52:44.160
And it's a really, really cool project.

52:44.160 --> 52:48.240
I met with the organizer and she has really great plans

52:48.240 --> 52:50.560
for the place and we wanna do something to help out.

52:50.560 --> 52:52.960
So for every one of those you purchase,

52:52.960 --> 52:54.640
we're gonna donate some money to them,

52:54.640 --> 52:57.840
which is a really exciting way to sweeten it for you

52:57.840 --> 53:00.800
if you wanna get a good vibe from also getting something fun.

53:00.800 --> 53:04.560
So mackleroycollection.com is the address.

53:04.560 --> 53:05.280
Go there right now.

53:05.280 --> 53:06.320
You've only got 16 days.

53:06.320 --> 53:07.280
Don't wait, don't sleep.

53:07.280 --> 53:08.160
You won't forget.

53:08.160 --> 53:09.040
Go get it right now.

53:10.080 --> 53:11.840
So as you guys know, we're working on,

53:11.840 --> 53:14.800
or maybe you don't, but like we're doing a TV show with CSO.

53:16.080 --> 53:16.880
It's gonna be great.

53:16.880 --> 53:19.840
My brother and my brother and me, all new, a visual element,

53:19.840 --> 53:21.360
but we're gonna need your help with it.

53:21.360 --> 53:22.800
We're gonna need some questions from you.

53:22.800 --> 53:26.160
We're working on a submission form for that right now.

53:26.160 --> 53:28.800
It's gonna be online so everybody can submit their questions

53:28.800 --> 53:30.000
just like you do for the show.

53:31.040 --> 53:33.280
So start thinking about your questions.

53:33.840 --> 53:35.360
You know, same rules we do for the show.

53:35.360 --> 53:36.640
They need to be concise.

53:36.640 --> 53:40.320
They need to be actual, you know, requests for advice

53:40.320 --> 53:42.880
and not just like, what do you guys think about bread?

53:42.880 --> 53:44.480
But like a real thing.

53:44.480 --> 53:45.520
We can help you with something

53:45.520 --> 53:47.120
that's actually going on in your life.

53:47.920 --> 53:52.640
No bummers, but not so whimsical as to appear silly.

53:53.360 --> 53:54.320
And yeah, just pay attention to-

53:54.320 --> 53:55.840
Sorry, what was the last one, Travis?

53:55.840 --> 53:56.240
Just no whimsy?

53:56.240 --> 53:57.280
Not so whimsical.

53:58.080 --> 54:00.240
Not so whimsical as to appear silly.

54:00.240 --> 54:01.680
There are guidelines that I wrote

54:01.680 --> 54:02.960
that you can definitely read

54:02.960 --> 54:04.320
once you go to submit your questions.

54:04.320 --> 54:06.960
They'll help- Yeah, they'll be better than this.

54:06.960 --> 54:08.320
But we don't have a link for that yet.

54:08.320 --> 54:10.080
But as soon as we have one,

54:10.080 --> 54:14.560
it'll be on our Facebook page and on our Twitter.

54:14.560 --> 54:16.480
And then of course, you know, next episode

54:16.480 --> 54:18.800
when we have a link, hopefully by the next week,

54:18.800 --> 54:19.920
we'll share it with you.

54:19.920 --> 54:21.200
But we just wanna give you a heads up.

54:21.200 --> 54:21.760
We'll hitch up.

54:22.320 --> 54:23.680
We are gonna be at Max Fun Con East.

54:23.680 --> 54:24.880
Are there any tickets left?

54:24.880 --> 54:25.600
Don't know.

54:25.600 --> 54:26.560
There were just a handful.

54:26.560 --> 54:29.120
There were like nine available on Friday.

54:29.120 --> 54:30.480
So they may all be gone.

54:30.480 --> 54:33.200
If not, run, do not walk to get these tickets.

54:33.200 --> 54:34.800
It may be an active competition.

54:34.800 --> 54:35.600
It may be completely over.

54:35.600 --> 54:37.680
We're doing, we're not doing my bit in there.

54:37.680 --> 54:38.800
We're actually doing Adventure Zone.

54:39.360 --> 54:40.320
It's gonna be really fun.

54:40.320 --> 54:41.520
The whole fam is coming out.

54:42.160 --> 54:43.440
Sydney is gonna be doing a class.

54:43.440 --> 54:44.080
Is that right?

54:44.080 --> 54:47.120
Yeah, she's doing a class that should be really neat.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.520
Medically related.

54:49.520 --> 54:49.920
Cool.

54:49.920 --> 54:50.480
That'll be neat.

54:50.480 --> 54:52.640
And I'll just be walking around looking for ghosts.

54:52.640 --> 54:54.000
Yeah, it'll be a ton of fun.

54:55.200 --> 54:58.000
That one takes place in the Adirondacks.

54:58.800 --> 54:59.760
Poconos.

54:59.760 --> 55:00.560
The Poconos?

55:01.280 --> 55:01.760
Yep.

55:01.760 --> 55:04.160
Have I been saying the Adirondacks this whole time?

55:04.160 --> 55:05.600
I don't know what either one of them are.

55:05.600 --> 55:08.480
So, but I do know it is the Adirondacks in New York.

55:08.480 --> 55:10.880
This one takes place on the peak of the Matterhorn.

55:11.440 --> 55:12.880
It's gonna be a really fun time.

55:12.880 --> 55:14.320
Yeah, go to maxfuncon.com.

55:14.320 --> 55:15.920
You can find out how to get tickets there.

55:15.920 --> 55:18.640
We've all got PO boxes, but I wanted to bring it up

55:18.640 --> 55:21.600
because I am moving at the end of August.

55:22.240 --> 55:28.240
So from this point forward, don't send stuff to the LA box

55:28.800 --> 55:31.360
because I will not be able to get it after August.

55:31.360 --> 55:35.280
I'm moving back to Cincinnati to be closer to my family and such

55:35.280 --> 55:37.440
for when our spawn arrives.

55:38.960 --> 55:42.000
So yeah, I'll switch back to a Cincinnati PO box

55:42.000 --> 55:43.120
so we can keep that going.

55:43.120 --> 55:46.480
But if you've sent something now, I'll still get it.

55:46.480 --> 55:48.880
I'll be here for another like six weeks.

55:48.880 --> 55:53.200
But in the meantime, go ahead and send it to PO box 5400 West Virginia,

55:53.200 --> 55:56.080
2106, 25706.

55:56.080 --> 55:59.440
Or PO box 66639 Austin, Texas, 78766.

55:59.440 --> 56:00.320
Either one will get you there.

56:00.320 --> 56:01.120
Don't even worry about it.

56:01.120 --> 56:01.840
Don't even worry about it.

56:01.840 --> 56:03.600
Well, that one's for Griffin and this one's for me.

56:03.600 --> 56:06.080
I have, but anyway, those are PO boxes.

56:06.080 --> 56:09.440
Go to maximumfun.org and you can find all the great shows

56:09.440 --> 56:11.200
that are on our podcast network.

56:11.200 --> 56:13.280
Talking about shows like Adam Ruins Everything

56:13.280 --> 56:15.840
and One Bad Mother and Jordan Jesse Goh

56:15.840 --> 56:18.240
and Judge John Hodgman and stop podcasting yourself.

56:18.240 --> 56:19.600
They're all so, so great.

56:19.600 --> 56:20.720
We have a bunch of other shows.

56:20.720 --> 56:21.600
Some of them are on the network.

56:21.600 --> 56:22.320
Some of them aren't.

56:22.320 --> 56:24.960
You can find all the shows we do at mackleroyshows.com.

56:24.960 --> 56:26.640
That includes the video projects that we do

56:26.640 --> 56:31.200
like Monster Factory, which Justin and I do for Polygon.

56:31.200 --> 56:32.720
You can also find all that PO box info.

56:33.280 --> 56:35.360
Travis, have you added my PO box to that website yet?

56:36.160 --> 56:36.560
No, not yet.

56:36.560 --> 56:38.480
Boy, that would be good to have up on that web address.

56:38.480 --> 56:39.760
Just a bad brother.

56:40.640 --> 56:42.960
Yeah, you can find out all the stuff we do on mackleroyshows.com.

56:42.960 --> 56:44.960
We do a ton of shows, so you can find them all there.

56:44.960 --> 56:46.880
And thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

56:46.880 --> 56:49.120
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

56:49.120 --> 56:50.800
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

56:50.800 --> 56:52.800
Thank you very much, John and Long Winters.

56:54.080 --> 56:55.680
That's going to do it for us, folks.

56:55.680 --> 56:57.600
Thank you so much for listening to our program.

56:57.600 --> 56:58.400
Griffin, do you have one more?

56:58.400 --> 57:00.480
Actually, can I say one thing before I forget?

57:01.920 --> 57:04.480
I just got to go up to San Diego Comic Con

57:04.480 --> 57:08.320
and I wanted to say thank you to Hank Green, Paul and Storm,

57:09.840 --> 57:13.520
Patrick Rothfuss, Adam Savage, all the people at Woodstock,

57:14.400 --> 57:17.120
and everybody that I met walking around the convention floor.

57:17.120 --> 57:18.400
I got recognized a couple of times

57:18.400 --> 57:20.080
and it made me feel really special

57:20.080 --> 57:21.360
and I really appreciated it.

57:21.360 --> 57:24.160
And everybody was just super nice and I had a great time.

57:24.160 --> 57:27.440
So yeah, I just want to say thank you to everybody

57:27.440 --> 57:28.720
while I was thinking about it.

57:28.720 --> 57:30.240
Thank you, Sandy D.

57:30.960 --> 57:32.480
And also thank you to Tybee Diskin,

57:33.200 --> 57:34.480
my best friend who I went with

57:34.480 --> 57:35.920
and I wouldn't have been able to go without her.

57:35.920 --> 57:37.920
So like, yeah, it was great.

57:39.280 --> 57:40.240
Okay, final Yahoo.

57:40.240 --> 57:41.840
This one was sent in by Yahoo Answers,

57:41.840 --> 57:44.160
or this one was sent in by Connor Stuxlogger.

57:45.520 --> 57:49.440
By the way, the Verizon is apparently

57:49.440 --> 57:51.120
about to buy Yahoo for $5 billion.

57:51.120 --> 57:53.840
So like a lot of fucking, I hate to drop this energy

57:53.840 --> 57:54.800
right at the end of the show,

57:54.800 --> 57:56.880
but there's a lot of things up in the air right now.

57:56.880 --> 57:58.880
And just like, I could use your thoughts

57:58.880 --> 58:00.240
and your prayers and your concern,

58:00.240 --> 58:02.880
just like any energy you can sort of channel my way

58:03.680 --> 58:07.760
as I go through what may be a difficult transition

58:07.760 --> 58:09.360
based on what Verizon decides to do.

58:09.360 --> 58:11.600
I doubt that anybody would look at the Yahoo Answers product

58:11.600 --> 58:13.040
and say, yes, yes, that is the thing

58:13.040 --> 58:14.640
I want to invest money in to keep alive.

58:15.760 --> 58:17.680
So just like, yeah, thoughts and prayers, thank you.

58:18.160 --> 58:19.600
Connor Stuxlogger sent this one in.

58:19.600 --> 58:22.960
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Stephen R. who asks,

58:24.240 --> 58:28.960
if I ate two Baconators from Wendy's, will I die?

58:28.960 --> 58:32.480
My name is Justin McElroy.

58:32.480 --> 58:33.520
I'm Travis McElroy.

58:33.520 --> 58:34.480
I'm Griffin McElroy.

58:34.480 --> 58:35.600
You've been my brother and brother to me.

58:35.600 --> 58:38.400
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

58:38.400 --> 58:56.160
Hey, good girls, do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna?
