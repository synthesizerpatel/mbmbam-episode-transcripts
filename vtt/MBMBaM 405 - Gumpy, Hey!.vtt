00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.840
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern era.

00:47.840 --> 00:53.760
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

00:53.760 --> 00:57.760
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary Griffin McElroy.

00:57.760 --> 01:04.560
Oh boys, I'm so excited. Why are you excited? Because it's Avengers Infinity War Watch.

01:04.560 --> 01:11.280
Infinity Watch? Let's go with Infinity Watch. Yes, we watched Avengers Infinity War Watch

01:11.280 --> 01:17.120
at midnight in Detroit and right after a live show because we felt like we'd fucking earned it.

01:17.120 --> 01:23.440
And boy, that was a late one, but I sure enjoyed seeing all the Avengers get back together to fight

01:23.440 --> 01:32.560
off the big bad one who was I think a demon and it was very late and I loved seeing Fireman do his

01:32.560 --> 01:38.240
stunts. I will say just a brief spoiler, I think my favorite thing was watching all those beefy

01:38.240 --> 01:45.200
bros hugging. Oh, I love to see those beefy bros together. You saw beef boys who to this point

01:45.200 --> 01:49.920
have existed in their own movies and Stan Lee and his beautiful mind made them all get together and

01:49.920 --> 01:56.640
hug in the same movie and I said, so good. I said yes. Yeah, I said yes too. Griffin and I were

01:56.640 --> 02:02.400
watching it for the first time in that theater and we both kept saying yes over and over and over

02:02.400 --> 02:09.360
again. Yes, yes, yes, good hugs. I think that my favorite moment in the movie, once again, spoilers,

02:09.360 --> 02:15.440
is when Star-Lord and Tony Stark just stop what they're doing and make out so hard. Yeah, they

02:15.440 --> 02:20.800
kiss each other really hard on the mouth. For like a long time and then they stop and they say like,

02:20.800 --> 02:26.640
now we're forever bros. Yeah, I remember saying yes out loud on that one. Ant-Man was there,

02:26.640 --> 02:31.280
people, a lot of buzz talking about how he wasn't, but he was just so very small. Small,

02:31.280 --> 02:39.600
he's actually in the entire movie. He punched the space demon so hard that I thought I was gonna

02:39.600 --> 02:47.200
nut. I lost it. I said yes like three times in a row. Did you guys, when Space Grimace stopped the

02:47.200 --> 02:54.960
movie and he yelled at our projectionist and called him by name. Yeah. He said, Derek, stop the movie

02:54.960 --> 03:01.440
and then he sat on a stump that he had recently sawed down himself. So it's 15 minutes of him

03:01.440 --> 03:06.640
sawing this tree down, right? Yes, I remember. And I'm like seven and a half minutes in thinking,

03:06.640 --> 03:14.800
is this hard? And it was because he sat down and he ate about seven bananas and the sequence took

03:14.800 --> 03:20.720
about 20 minutes. And I mean, I get it that he's very, just the caloric intake it would take to

03:20.720 --> 03:26.240
power a titan like him. In his defense, he said there's probably an infinity gem in one of these

03:26.240 --> 03:29.520
bananas and I'm gonna find it the old fashioned way. And he was right. Yeah, and he was right.

03:29.520 --> 03:35.520
There it was, the tropical gem. But all your favorites were in this one, Iron Man, Spider-Man.

03:35.520 --> 03:45.600
Wait, the Animaniacs, Crash Bandicoot, Marco Rubio. They all got together for the-

03:45.600 --> 03:49.680
Rick or Morty, whichever one is the scientist. Yeah, haven't seen it.

03:50.480 --> 03:54.880
I like the part where they revealed that Stan Lee was actually the world's greatest hero

03:55.520 --> 04:00.560
and he had just been like stepping between dimensions. That was a pretty huge reveal

04:00.560 --> 04:04.480
because this whole time you're like, oh, it's nice of them to put in some cameos

04:04.480 --> 04:08.560
for old Stan Lee. But then you're like, no, actually he's Shazam.

04:08.560 --> 04:12.160
He played Batman in this one. It felt masturbatory a little bit. He's like,

04:12.160 --> 04:17.040
well, this is my movie, so I'm gonna save it. And he does. It felt a little masturbatory,

04:17.040 --> 04:19.760
but it might just be that way because he masturbated in one scene.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.840
There was that one scene where he masturbated real hard.

04:21.840 --> 04:25.120
Right there, real good. And also then he pulled out the book that

04:25.120 --> 04:29.680
he was writing the movie in as the movie was happening and he wrote down Stan Lee masturbates

04:29.680 --> 04:34.720
and then he did it. Do you think, Stan Lee's an older fellow, probably doesn't leave his house

04:34.720 --> 04:42.800
much. I know that he's a nonagenarian, I believe, but they want him to film all this jazz. If it

04:42.800 --> 04:48.880
was me, I'd never leave my house. Do you think Stan Lee has a green screen room in his home

04:48.880 --> 04:57.840
that they just like come and load in like half a school bus or like a DJ table or an electric

04:57.840 --> 05:02.880
chair, if you remember that one. Little known fact, Andy Serkis plays Stan Lee in all the

05:02.880 --> 05:06.320
Marvel movies. In a lot of them. But all your friends are here. You're gonna see a lot of

05:06.320 --> 05:15.600
familiar faces like Scarlet Witch, bonkers from the TV show Bonkers. Totally nuts. Toxic Avengers.

05:15.600 --> 05:20.800
Toxic Avengers. I think I said Marco Rubio. I'm in it. Yeah, Big Bad Beetleborgs.

05:20.800 --> 05:27.200
And they line up and one by one punch the demon. And he stands there and he's like,

05:27.200 --> 05:33.840
I'm too tough for this. And Stan Lee gets the killing blow. Anyway, it's a pretty bad movie,

05:33.840 --> 05:37.600
and I don't know why everybody liked it so much, because I thought it was trash.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.520
Not a good movie. There's a lot of masturbation in it.

05:39.520 --> 05:43.120
Have you heard of the masturbation, the 20 minutes of banana eating,

05:43.120 --> 05:48.560
the 15 minutes of log sawing? It's just not a good, well put together film.

05:48.560 --> 05:51.120
Bonkers just sort of runaway racism.

05:51.120 --> 05:57.280
Yeah. Oh, huge. Huge. Huge, big racism.

05:57.280 --> 06:07.040
I also found it weird that it seems like every superhero had a bathroom break in the movie.

06:07.600 --> 06:11.520
And the movie would stop. They'd be like, I have to go to the bathroom. And then everybody would

06:11.520 --> 06:18.240
just stand around while Drax or Thor or whoever went to the bathroom. And they'd wait for them

06:18.240 --> 06:24.560
to come back. I also thought it was weird when Drax changed his name to Rax and then tried to

06:24.560 --> 06:26.960
sell everybody roast beef sandwiches. Yeah.

06:26.960 --> 06:32.400
Here's the one that killed me. Here's the one where I had to get up and leave.

06:32.400 --> 06:41.920
There is a 37 minute steady cam shot of Peter Stormare scrolling through direct TV listings.

06:41.920 --> 06:46.080
There's nothing on. There's nothing on. There's nothing on. I don't want this.

06:46.080 --> 06:50.080
I've seen this episode of Mystery at the Museum before. There's nothing on.

06:50.080 --> 06:55.120
And it's like 37 minutes of that. Sometimes if you look out the window,

06:55.680 --> 07:02.800
you can kind of see Green Lantern flying around or something. But it's like, by and large,

07:02.800 --> 07:06.720
there's nothing happening in this scene. That moved this narrative forward.

07:06.720 --> 07:12.240
I did not say yes once during this scene. I did not say yes once during the banana scene.

07:12.240 --> 07:16.320
I did not say yes. I said yes once during the Stanley jerk off scene.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.240
Yes. And you know when I said it.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.520
You don't have to. Yeah.

07:25.600 --> 07:30.560
I will say, all in all, I like the beefy boys hugging. Yeah.

07:31.200 --> 07:35.360
I like the Stanley fight scenes. Three out of five.

07:35.360 --> 07:38.000
Well, it's important that we do a review every time we do one of these segments.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.520
We've always done it. Yep.

07:39.520 --> 07:42.240
You got to put a number on it. If you don't put a number on it, it doesn't count.

07:43.040 --> 07:46.080
Hey, Super Justin. That's an Avengers joke. Can you read a question?

07:46.960 --> 07:50.320
My father was recently retelling a story over dinner that I've heard

07:50.320 --> 07:54.720
since early childhood. When he was in grade school, he was playing American football.

07:54.720 --> 07:57.360
Hey, you don't have to do that. No, I appreciate it.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.680
This is a safe place. Thank you for clarifying.

07:59.680 --> 08:03.920
With some friends before being aggressively tackled to the ground by a boy a few years

08:03.920 --> 08:07.520
older than he, blacking out instantly and waking up in the hospital.

08:07.520 --> 08:11.920
The boy did not apologize. This time in telling the story, however,

08:12.720 --> 08:16.240
my father casually revealed that the tackler was Mark Harmon.

08:16.800 --> 08:22.800
My question is this. Do I have a legitimate case against Mark Harmon for tackling my dad?

08:23.360 --> 08:29.840
And if so, what should I say slash do upon him seeing him in court or otherwise?

08:29.840 --> 08:34.080
Please advise. I need closure now that I'm fully aware of the direct link between NCIS

08:34.080 --> 08:39.680
and my primal fear of contact sports. That's from healing in Hawaii.

08:39.680 --> 08:47.120
Now, is it possible that your dad has told this story a lot of times and has felt like,

08:47.120 --> 08:51.600
maybe I don't grab him like I used to. This time, I'm going to lie and say it was

08:51.600 --> 08:56.560
Mark Harmon who tackled. Like your dad just out of the corner of his eye saw an episode of NCIS

08:56.560 --> 09:00.240
playing and he said Mark Harmon. And what's going to happen is you're going to go on like a cross

09:00.240 --> 09:04.400
country manhunt for Mark Harmon. You're going to find him and you're going to be like, Mark Harmon,

09:04.400 --> 09:08.720
you tackled my dad. And Mark Harmon is going to be like, I never even played football,

09:08.720 --> 09:13.600
American or otherwise. And you're like, what? And Mark Harmon is the perfect poll for that,

09:13.600 --> 09:17.760
right? Because if he was trying to impress you and he's like, I got tackled by all of Destiny's

09:17.760 --> 09:23.040
child, then you would know like, come on, daddy, that's a lie. Mark Harmon, I could see a quiet

09:23.040 --> 09:28.720
rage in those eyes. I could see a tackle monster behind that gentle face.

09:28.720 --> 09:32.480
Is it possible while your dad had the football, he was running into the end zone. He says,

09:33.760 --> 09:40.000
he said something like, I'm going to do some terrorism in the end zone. And Mark Harmon,

09:40.000 --> 09:45.600
you know, said, I'm going to hurt CJ Craig. I'm going to hurt CJ Craig. And then your Mark Harmon

09:45.600 --> 09:50.960
uncle Mark came over and dunked him to the ground for America. Is that a possibility?

09:50.960 --> 09:55.520
I think that's exactly what happened. It's also possible that because this would explain a lot

09:55.520 --> 10:03.600
that Mark Harmon remembers in clear, like perfect detail, tackling this young man. And he felt so

10:03.600 --> 10:08.080
terrible about it that it is what has driven him to excellence today.

10:08.640 --> 10:12.960
Or he felt so good about it that it drove him to excellence and made him feel so powerful and

10:12.960 --> 10:17.680
strong. And here's the flip side of this. If your dad had gotten the big tackle down on NCIS as Mark

10:17.680 --> 10:22.160
Harmon, your dad would be the NCIS man. Your dad would love CJ Craig.

10:22.160 --> 10:28.080
I don't, I won't take any more jokes about Mark Harmon. The man's a fucking hero.

10:28.640 --> 10:31.920
And I'm not going to, I was not joking at all. Well, I was, I mean,

10:31.920 --> 10:37.280
now I'm like saying he's a literal hero. I've told the story before on this podcast.

10:37.280 --> 10:44.320
I'm fairly certain. And I'm going to tell it again. The year was 1996.

10:44.320 --> 10:50.560
A young Colin Sprecht, 16 years old in a, in a riding shotgun and his friend's car,

10:50.560 --> 10:56.400
the friend's joy riding. There was a crash in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles.

10:56.960 --> 11:03.280
And the crash, luckily for Colin Sprecht, just happened to be in front of the home of Mark

11:03.280 --> 11:11.600
Harmon. Mark Harmon goes to the car and he used a sledgehammer to break the window of the car.

11:11.600 --> 11:14.160
That he just, that he just had.

11:14.160 --> 11:17.680
He's going to bring, I'm going to bring this fucking sledgehammer. I'm going to need it.

11:17.680 --> 11:23.840
He tugged me because I was still upside down with the seatbelt in and he ripped me out of the car,

11:23.840 --> 11:28.000
said Sprecht. And he suffered third degree burns and was hospitalized for months.

11:28.000 --> 11:35.440
So a little bit faster on the draw next time, Mark. But Mark Harmon, Mark Harmon had never

11:35.440 --> 11:40.880
spoken about the incident until the story in 2013. Didn't tell anybody about it.

11:41.600 --> 11:45.280
And here's what he said when actually, actually interviewed about it. He said,

11:45.280 --> 11:49.440
I won't take credit for it because if the car exploded and I'm there next to the car,

11:49.440 --> 11:52.720
then you're talking about two young boys who don't have a father, said Harmon.

11:52.720 --> 11:56.320
And you'd be doing this interview with my wife and talking about how stupid it was.

11:59.360 --> 12:04.000
So humble. And you know, he was sprinting towards the car, his Mjolnir in hand.

12:04.000 --> 12:04.400
Yes.

12:04.400 --> 12:08.080
And he had the thought, I only have the courage to do this because of the great

12:08.080 --> 12:12.880
tackle I did where I dunked that kid to, I dunked that kid to sleep on the gridiron.

12:12.880 --> 12:16.960
And that, but here's the thing, that could have been your dad. That could have been your

12:16.960 --> 12:20.400
dad living in a nice house in Brentwood, ready to be on West Wing.

12:20.400 --> 12:28.400
Or is it maybe a penance? Is it maybe to get forgiveness for the terrible tackle?

12:28.400 --> 12:32.480
He has to rescue a hundred people from burning cars.

12:32.480 --> 12:34.880
And now he just has 99 miles to go.

12:34.880 --> 12:40.960
In some way or someone must have some kind of like tally marker of how many times we

12:40.960 --> 12:45.680
gently or directly referenced the lives of Blackjack Savage.

12:45.680 --> 12:56.160
The wildest part about this story, if I saved someone's groceries from a car that had stalled

12:56.160 --> 13:02.240
to the side of a country road, it would be all I talked about for the rest of my fucking life.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.640
It would be like, oh yeah, there were popsicles and they were about to melt.

13:04.640 --> 13:07.520
And I was like, not on my watch. And I got most of them.

13:07.520 --> 13:11.280
I ate three of them as a payment.

13:11.280 --> 13:14.080
Yeah, but it'd be all I talked about.

13:14.080 --> 13:20.640
It would be in my bio when you'd come to see me at the off-off-Broadway one-man show

13:20.640 --> 13:24.400
where I tell the story of how I saved someone from a burning car.

13:24.400 --> 13:28.160
Beloved popsicle rescuer, Justin McElroy.

13:28.160 --> 13:29.600
Anyway, I love Mark Harmon.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.800
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by level 9,000 Yajuritru Davenport.

13:32.800 --> 13:36.160
It's from Yajuranser's user, YuWrong, who asks,

13:36.160 --> 13:38.160
heroes and villains?

13:38.160 --> 13:41.680
Who are the biggest heroes and villains in baseball today?

13:41.680 --> 13:43.200
Give your reasons why.

13:43.200 --> 13:52.800
Well, Damien Darke, the pitcher for the Orioles, everybody seems to hate this guy.

13:53.760 --> 14:01.520
He throws his pitch wildly and sometimes somebody will look at him weird from the stands

14:01.520 --> 14:04.880
and he'll throw a pitch right at him and get the person on base.

14:04.880 --> 14:07.760
So the team hates him, too, because that's not great.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.760
You're not supposed to just throw the ball right.

14:09.760 --> 14:10.400
Well, hold on.

14:10.400 --> 14:14.960
If you throw the ball right out into the stands and hit somebody who's like yelling like,

14:14.960 --> 14:19.120
Damien, you're a dipshit, and you hit him and the popcorn goes up all funny,

14:19.120 --> 14:23.360
is that a point for the other team or is it a foul?

14:24.080 --> 14:27.920
Do you know how much I want to play in this space with you?

14:28.640 --> 14:30.800
Desperately want to play in this space with you.

14:30.800 --> 14:35.840
I don't understand enough about modern sport, I think,

14:36.640 --> 14:38.800
to play with you here in the space you've created.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.560
Well, then let me tell you the biggest villain,

14:40.560 --> 14:43.120
and I think we can both agree on this, the Philly fanatic.

14:43.120 --> 14:44.640
Yeah, yeah.

14:44.640 --> 14:47.120
Mostly because of how many he's killed.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.840
I remember that one time he was dancing on top of the dugout

14:49.840 --> 14:55.200
and whatever you want to define his gaping maw or proboscis or whatever you want to call it,

14:55.200 --> 14:57.840
he just leaned down and swallowed a person whole

14:57.840 --> 14:59.840
because they were rooting for the other team.

14:59.840 --> 15:02.480
Oh, I hate that.

15:02.480 --> 15:04.000
You hate that when that happens.

15:04.800 --> 15:10.160
And he's done it so much, like twice a game for the last 20 years.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.680
Is that true or?

15:11.680 --> 15:13.920
Yeah, Philly fanatic eats people.

15:13.920 --> 15:17.200
Biggest hero, I would say, is probably Stew.

15:18.000 --> 15:24.640
And this is a guy that sells beer for the Orioles.

15:24.640 --> 15:27.840
Again, it's the only team I'm able to pull for some reason right now.

15:27.840 --> 15:31.360
And he just walks through and he's just like, ice cold beer.

15:31.360 --> 15:33.600
And he says it in a way that I hear it,

15:33.600 --> 15:37.200
and I'm not really enjoying myself because it's 200 fucking degrees

15:37.200 --> 15:39.600
and the game's been going on for nine hours.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.840
And I hear him say, ice cold beer.

15:42.480 --> 15:44.960
And I think like, oh, Stew, you got my fucking number.

15:44.960 --> 15:46.080
Slide me, what is that?

15:46.080 --> 15:47.280
Oh, a Bud Light?

15:47.280 --> 15:48.000
I guess.

15:48.880 --> 15:51.360
Do you have the ones in like the metal bottles?

15:51.360 --> 15:51.840
You don't?

15:51.840 --> 15:56.080
You just have it in like, you know, sloppy Slurpee cups that are gonna get all over?

15:56.080 --> 15:56.480
Okay.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.240
Can I at least get a Bud Light lime?

15:58.240 --> 15:59.600
Because it's summer.

15:59.600 --> 16:00.720
Summertime, Stew.

16:00.720 --> 16:01.440
Summer beer?

16:02.560 --> 16:04.400
Summer beer, ice cold light.

16:05.360 --> 16:06.640
Summer beer from Swo-

16:08.240 --> 16:08.880
What was that?

16:08.880 --> 16:10.240
What did you say, Stew?

16:10.240 --> 16:11.280
Don't worry about it.

16:12.160 --> 16:15.280
So biggest villain, another big one, is the Caddyshack Mole.

16:15.280 --> 16:15.840
Yeah.

16:15.840 --> 16:16.640
Yeah.

16:16.640 --> 16:21.200
It's like they work so hard to maintain the greens, and then, you know,

16:22.480 --> 16:25.920
Randy Johnson throws a big pitch, and then the Mole jumps up and grabs the ball

16:25.920 --> 16:27.280
and takes it back underground,

16:27.280 --> 16:29.160
and then everybody's game is ruined.

16:29.160 --> 16:31.200
Well, Griffin, you've just dropped a name,

16:31.200 --> 16:32.700
I think, of one of our greatest heroes

16:32.700 --> 16:36.000
for defeating that evil bird, Randy Johnson.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.360
Randy Johnson is a great hero.

16:37.360 --> 16:39.160
That bird was a pervert.

16:39.160 --> 16:42.200
A lot of people won't say it, but we will.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.360
Well, not a lot of birds are perverts

16:43.360 --> 16:44.640
because they have a bird's eye view,

16:44.640 --> 16:45.960
and they'll look down and see some stuff

16:45.960 --> 16:47.040
that you're not supposed to see,

16:47.040 --> 16:48.720
and then they'll be like.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.680
And only Randy Johnson can stop them.

16:50.680 --> 16:52.620
And only Randy Johnson can do it.

16:52.620 --> 16:54.440
One of the big villains for me

16:54.440 --> 16:56.520
is the magic boxing gloves Rocky wears

16:56.520 --> 16:58.420
that make him keep fighting

16:58.420 --> 17:00.880
even if he wants to stop fighting.

17:00.880 --> 17:04.280
Oh, so this is not a greatest villain's baseball thing.

17:04.280 --> 17:05.120
Yeah.

17:06.040 --> 17:07.000
Yes, correct.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.800
Well, you remember when those magic boxing gloves

17:08.800 --> 17:10.560
took a turn at professional baseball.

17:10.560 --> 17:11.400
You great.

17:11.400 --> 17:15.800
I did wanna say, Griffin did say the Caddyshack Mall,

17:15.800 --> 17:16.620
so maybe you guys can all fuck off.

17:16.620 --> 17:19.680
I did still tie it into baseball in some way.

17:19.680 --> 17:20.520
I referenced baseball.

17:20.520 --> 17:22.060
You didn't even let me finish.

17:22.060 --> 17:23.140
Oh, yeah, please.

17:23.140 --> 17:26.320
One of them was a catching glove.

17:26.320 --> 17:27.200
Oh, okay.

17:27.200 --> 17:29.000
And one was a punching glove, so.

17:30.200 --> 17:32.500
Michael Jordan, I don't know which one he is

17:32.500 --> 17:34.660
because he's both a little bit villainous

17:34.660 --> 17:38.600
in that he's like probably not great at the sport,

17:38.600 --> 17:40.880
but everyone's still sort of paying a lot of attention

17:40.880 --> 17:41.720
to him there anyway.

17:41.720 --> 17:43.800
But a hero because he did know when was the right time

17:43.800 --> 17:46.680
to walk away and defeat the Monstars.

17:46.680 --> 17:48.900
Griffin, to touch on a little bit

17:48.900 --> 17:51.640
of your actual sports expertise,

17:51.640 --> 17:54.920
how come in baseball people, there are no heels

17:54.920 --> 17:58.520
and whatever you're called when you're the good guy,

17:58.520 --> 18:01.800
why don't they have more storylines in baseball?

18:01.800 --> 18:04.120
Well, they do, but there's this concept in wrestling

18:04.120 --> 18:06.720
called kayfabe that's like now Shinsuke Nakamura,

18:06.720 --> 18:10.800
my son, is now a heel, and as much as it hurts me

18:10.800 --> 18:14.000
to watch people be angry at him or sad at him

18:14.000 --> 18:17.200
for kicking wrestlers in the balls very, very hard,

18:17.200 --> 18:18.960
which is his new gag, which is great

18:18.960 --> 18:20.800
because he's worked so hard his entire life

18:20.800 --> 18:22.320
to become a professional wrestler

18:22.320 --> 18:24.160
and trained his body and mind and moves,

18:24.160 --> 18:26.680
and now he's just sort of doing some beavis

18:26.680 --> 18:28.340
and butt head stuff out there.

18:29.600 --> 18:32.260
It's still fun because you know he's probably

18:32.260 --> 18:35.680
not that bad a guy, but the bad ones in baseball,

18:35.680 --> 18:37.680
they can actually, my experience has been,

18:37.680 --> 18:40.400
they can actually be quite bad,

18:40.400 --> 18:42.240
even when they're off the-

18:42.240 --> 18:43.400
On and off the court.

18:43.400 --> 18:45.220
On and off the grass court.

18:45.220 --> 18:47.300
So they can get tricky there.

18:47.300 --> 18:50.300
Do you think that the, I think the only way

18:50.300 --> 18:52.940
to denote the bad guys and the good guys

18:52.940 --> 18:55.980
is based on what song they pick for their walkout music

18:55.980 --> 18:57.860
when they come up to bat?

18:57.860 --> 18:58.700
You know what I mean?

18:58.700 --> 19:01.980
Because if they're playing like some ACDC,

19:01.980 --> 19:04.860
they probably see themselves as like the bad boy.

19:04.860 --> 19:07.500
You know, they're like, oh, I'm a bad boy of baseball.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.740
But if you walk out to like some melon camp,

19:09.740 --> 19:11.160
you probably see yourself as like,

19:11.160 --> 19:13.020
I'm just a good, I'm a good guy

19:13.020 --> 19:16.500
just out here trying to play some baseball in America.

19:16.500 --> 19:19.020
There's only one, there's one metric for me,

19:19.020 --> 19:20.660
and it's how many balls you throw out

19:20.660 --> 19:22.580
to the kids in the stands.

19:22.580 --> 19:26.460
You remember Smiley Tevis played for the,

19:26.460 --> 19:28.140
I believe the Baltimore Orioles,

19:28.140 --> 19:31.340
and he would throw every ball he got his hands on

19:31.340 --> 19:33.780
into the crowd, and so he'd, you know,

19:33.780 --> 19:35.540
catch a grounder, he would shortstop,

19:35.540 --> 19:37.740
and then he would run from the shortstop place

19:37.740 --> 19:41.780
all the way over to the out-of-bounds area

19:41.780 --> 19:44.860
and just throw that live ball right out to the kid.

19:44.860 --> 19:46.900
And he would really hum it if memory serves.

19:46.900 --> 19:49.540
He would bust at one of those kids, yeah.

19:49.540 --> 19:52.340
He ended up though being kind of forcibly retired

19:52.340 --> 19:53.740
from baseball though, because also every time

19:53.740 --> 19:55.620
he was up at bat, he would catch the balls

19:55.620 --> 19:57.780
the pitcher would throw, and then he would throw them

19:57.780 --> 19:59.100
into the stands.

19:59.100 --> 19:59.940
Yeah, they hated that.

19:59.940 --> 20:01.180
The umpires didn't know what to do with it,

20:01.180 --> 20:02.980
and they were like, I guess that's a foul ball.

20:02.980 --> 20:05.180
And he would like stand there and like foul

20:05.180 --> 20:07.700
like 11 or 12 times before they'd be like,

20:07.700 --> 20:10.740
okay, just walk, just go, just walk up there,

20:10.740 --> 20:12.260
come on, go away.

20:12.260 --> 20:13.500
Pitchers would just start hitting him

20:13.500 --> 20:15.380
just to get it over with, so Smiley Tevis

20:15.380 --> 20:18.220
got on the plate every single time.

20:18.220 --> 20:19.460
Yeah.

20:19.460 --> 20:21.260
He's my hero.

20:21.260 --> 20:23.220
Okay, that's important.

20:23.220 --> 20:25.900
This morning I decided to wear shorts to work.

20:25.900 --> 20:27.780
It's the first day of May, and they haven't turned

20:27.780 --> 20:30.660
the air conditioning on at school I work at.

20:30.660 --> 20:32.260
There was probably an article in there I was missing,

20:32.260 --> 20:33.100
sorry about that.

20:36.300 --> 20:38.900
Yesterday, I was really hot at the end of the day,

20:38.900 --> 20:40.900
and it was like 78 outside.

20:40.900 --> 20:43.500
Today it's gonna be 85, hence the shorts.

20:43.500 --> 20:46.060
Hey, that's a really good reading of that by the way,

20:46.060 --> 20:48.060
because that really sounded like you had stopped

20:48.060 --> 20:50.300
reading the question and were just telling us

20:50.300 --> 20:51.900
about the shorts you wore.

20:51.900 --> 20:54.980
No, I am wearing shorts, and it is probably too cool

20:54.980 --> 20:56.880
to be wearing them, but I put them on

20:56.880 --> 20:58.480
so I'm pot committed.

20:58.480 --> 21:02.480
So why are all of the other teachers coming up to me

21:02.480 --> 21:04.420
and saying, shorts?

21:04.420 --> 21:05.980
Nice.

21:05.980 --> 21:09.320
As if some kind of island spirit or beach nymph.

21:09.320 --> 21:11.620
It's gonna be hot, I wanna wear shorts.

21:11.620 --> 21:13.940
Help, am I losing my mind?

21:13.940 --> 21:16.980
That's from Shorts Boy in Chicago.

21:16.980 --> 21:19.440
Well, you can, listen, we can all have a lot of fun

21:19.440 --> 21:24.200
here on this show, but you can love shorts

21:24.200 --> 21:25.060
as much as you want.

21:25.060 --> 21:29.800
God knows I'm a fan of those little jeans, as I call them,

21:29.800 --> 21:34.800
and it doesn't make it so that that's the standard

21:35.620 --> 21:37.260
in a business environment.

21:37.260 --> 21:39.240
Like, you can love shorts with all your heart

21:39.240 --> 21:43.580
and be as uncomfortable in long pants as you want,

21:43.580 --> 21:45.140
but it's not gonna change the fact

21:45.140 --> 21:47.420
that you're gonna get a few raised eyebrows

21:47.420 --> 21:48.820
with a pair of shorts.

21:48.820 --> 21:52.140
Wearing shorts to work, especially in the environment

21:52.140 --> 21:55.000
of working at a school or something like that,

21:55.000 --> 21:58.460
is the equivalent of a futuristic dystopia

21:58.460 --> 22:02.180
where one person rises up to defeat the robot overlords

22:02.180 --> 22:04.380
and everybody rallies behind them.

22:04.380 --> 22:06.780
I can imagine that the principal of your school

22:06.780 --> 22:08.260
and, I don't know, the school board,

22:08.260 --> 22:09.780
whoever's in charge of that kind of thing,

22:09.780 --> 22:12.260
was like peeking through blinds at you and your shorts,

22:12.260 --> 22:14.460
like, we gotta stop this person.

22:14.460 --> 22:17.140
We can't let this person wear shorts anymore.

22:17.140 --> 22:19.900
It's like calf loose.

22:19.900 --> 22:23.700
I think that it could have been a compliment

22:23.700 --> 22:25.620
of your buns, maybe.

22:25.620 --> 22:28.060
Like, if they say shorts, nice.

22:28.060 --> 22:32.380
Like, it could have been a buns reference to your buns.

22:32.380 --> 22:35.240
But your shorts aren't, unless they're like,

22:35.240 --> 22:38.380
wholly inappropriate for work,

22:38.380 --> 22:40.500
they're not really featuring the buns

22:40.500 --> 22:42.820
more prominently than long pants.

22:42.820 --> 22:43.660
Aren't they, though?

22:43.660 --> 22:44.660
I mean, it is sort of an indicate.

22:44.660 --> 22:47.300
It does give the hint, the faintest wisp,

22:47.300 --> 22:49.660
of here's a little bit closer of a view

22:49.660 --> 22:52.840
to what's going on there in that region.

22:52.840 --> 22:56.140
Also, to tie it back to baseball,

22:56.140 --> 22:59.060
it's like shrinking the strike zone

22:59.060 --> 23:00.700
of where people are gonna look when they're like,

23:00.700 --> 23:03.260
I wanna see what pants they're wearing, right?

23:03.260 --> 23:06.740
They don't accidentally land on your calves or your knees.

23:06.740 --> 23:09.460
It's like, you are only gonna,

23:09.460 --> 23:12.180
it's 50-50 butt and thigh, you know what I mean?

23:12.180 --> 23:14.780
And so there's a chance, when you look at my pants

23:14.780 --> 23:16.740
to see what kind of pants I'm rocking,

23:16.740 --> 23:18.060
you're probably gonna see my butt.

23:18.060 --> 23:20.780
You'll consider the buns, and it's possible.

23:20.780 --> 23:22.580
Consider the buns!

23:22.580 --> 23:24.740
It's not appropriate for a workplace setting,

23:24.740 --> 23:26.100
but that's not your problem.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.980
Listen, we'd all be wearing shorts all the time

23:27.980 --> 23:30.380
unless it's cold all the time.

23:30.380 --> 23:34.220
And as Justin said, there's a time and a season.

23:34.220 --> 23:35.420
The Bible also said that,

23:35.420 --> 23:37.260
so Justin was technically quoting the Bible.

23:37.260 --> 23:39.920
And I was too when I mentioned the stuff about the buns.

23:39.920 --> 23:44.140
When we do live shows, I would love to wear shorts,

23:44.140 --> 23:47.100
but I don't classically, because I want people to know

23:47.100 --> 23:50.320
that I'm there to conduct my business.

23:51.480 --> 23:53.140
I'm there at a business meeting.

23:53.140 --> 23:55.380
It's nice to be able to walk off stage,

23:55.380 --> 23:58.460
and as soon as you hit the sight line off stage,

23:58.460 --> 24:00.020
just change into shorts.

24:00.020 --> 24:02.240
Because then you know your time's done.

24:02.240 --> 24:04.140
This is a thing people don't do anymore,

24:04.140 --> 24:09.140
that I hear about older generations of coming home

24:09.460 --> 24:12.500
and changing completely out of work clothes,

24:12.500 --> 24:15.520
and now it's time for my home clothes.

24:15.520 --> 24:17.180
And the problem is I work from home,

24:17.180 --> 24:19.060
and I don't know when to do that.

24:19.060 --> 24:22.500
I do that every day at 5.30, I change into shorts.

24:22.500 --> 24:23.340
A.M.?

24:23.340 --> 24:24.740
Best part of my day, yep.

24:25.860 --> 24:28.100
Or today, where I'm already wearing shorts,

24:28.100 --> 24:30.960
I'll change into slightly less dressy shorts.

24:32.540 --> 24:33.380
I'll tell you the good luck

24:33.380 --> 24:35.740
that those old folks had down pat

24:35.740 --> 24:37.620
that is tough to pull off these days

24:37.620 --> 24:40.260
is the shorts with the sock garters.

24:40.260 --> 24:44.520
That makes you look like you are down for anything, friend.

24:44.520 --> 24:45.360
Yeah.

24:45.360 --> 24:47.380
Hard to find, hard to find sock garters.

24:47.380 --> 24:49.940
When you go into any sort of clothing store,

24:49.940 --> 24:52.340
and you say, where's your sock garter section?

24:52.340 --> 24:54.280
You get some looks.

24:54.280 --> 24:56.100
Yeah, they say this is old Navy.

24:56.100 --> 24:57.460
Get out of here, pervert.

24:57.460 --> 24:59.220
You're looking for very old Navy.

24:59.220 --> 25:00.980
Somebody invent elastic,

25:00.980 --> 25:03.420
so we can get rid of these darn things.

25:03.420 --> 25:04.500
Was that what it was?

25:04.500 --> 25:07.040
Yeah, nobody had elastic, because the war was on.

25:08.020 --> 25:08.860
Which war?

25:08.860 --> 25:11.660
We needed them for our rubber band guns?

25:12.900 --> 25:15.300
No, for like tanks and stuff.

25:16.220 --> 25:17.660
Like, because there's plastic.

25:17.660 --> 25:19.540
You don't have plastic, you can't make elastic,

25:19.540 --> 25:21.820
so you can't put elastic into the stockings

25:21.820 --> 25:24.220
or the socks or whatever, so you had to have garters

25:24.220 --> 25:25.060
to hold them up.

25:25.060 --> 25:26.380
You must have slippy socks

25:26.380 --> 25:28.540
for the boys on the front.

25:28.540 --> 25:29.900
There's a war on.

25:29.900 --> 25:30.840
There's a war on.

25:30.840 --> 25:32.600
Your socks must be slippy.

25:32.600 --> 25:35.060
Timothy, your sock holes are so droopy, dude.

25:35.060 --> 25:36.740
Thank you for your service.

25:37.660 --> 25:39.820
Our friends overseas sure do appreciate it.

25:39.820 --> 25:40.820
You're gonna bring them home

25:40.820 --> 25:44.340
with your droopy ass weird old dead socks.

25:44.340 --> 25:45.180
I have a Yahoo here.

25:45.180 --> 25:47.100
This one was sent in by Grin Velesty.

25:47.100 --> 25:47.940
Thank you, Grin.

25:47.940 --> 25:51.100
It's Yahoo Answers user, and I don't know, they're...

25:52.420 --> 25:54.460
What could it matter at this point?

25:54.460 --> 25:56.960
Yeah, I'm gonna call them bubs, asks.

25:58.780 --> 26:01.980
Any ideas for my plant pot experiment?

26:01.980 --> 26:04.660
So, there are types of plant that are basically very tough

26:04.660 --> 26:06.100
and competitive with other plants

26:06.100 --> 26:07.260
and like to take over.

26:07.260 --> 26:12.260
Ivy, mint, dandelion, raspberry, mare's tail, et cetera.

26:12.260 --> 26:14.300
I had an idea of sourcing some of these

26:14.300 --> 26:17.180
and putting them all into one single plant pot

26:17.180 --> 26:18.580
and then waiting to see what happens

26:18.580 --> 26:19.900
as they all fight for dominance

26:19.900 --> 26:21.480
and see what comes out on top.

26:21.480 --> 26:22.420
So to make this interesting,

26:22.420 --> 26:24.460
what would be the best plants to use for this experiment?

26:24.460 --> 26:25.920
I'm looking for competitive plants

26:25.920 --> 26:28.620
that will fight each other for dominance.

26:28.620 --> 26:29.860
Y'all come on over this Sunday.

26:29.860 --> 26:31.380
I got a cooler full of brews.

26:31.380 --> 26:32.300
We're gonna sit down

26:32.300 --> 26:34.580
and watch these plants kick each other's asses.

26:34.580 --> 26:36.740
It is going to be so fucking dope.

26:36.740 --> 26:38.820
I'm having a plant and an illegal plant fight

26:38.820 --> 26:40.780
in the alley behind the Arby's,

26:40.780 --> 26:41.860
and we're gonna meet there

26:41.860 --> 26:44.560
and place our bets and my money's on bamboo.

26:44.560 --> 26:47.100
Their various tendrils and vines

26:47.100 --> 26:49.140
are gonna be whipping hither and yon.

26:49.140 --> 26:52.180
This person is assuming the plants will fight

26:52.180 --> 26:54.100
and not what will actually happen,

26:54.100 --> 26:57.880
which is the plants will team up to defeat you.

26:59.400 --> 27:00.620
Like think about it.

27:00.620 --> 27:02.420
If you were thinking logically what's gonna happen

27:02.420 --> 27:03.980
when I get a bunch of plants together,

27:03.980 --> 27:05.620
the plants are gonna dislike each other

27:05.620 --> 27:07.500
or they're going to dislike the person

27:07.500 --> 27:08.780
who locked them in a pot.

27:09.820 --> 27:10.720
I mean, for a while,

27:10.720 --> 27:12.480
I think they're gonna kick each other's asses

27:12.480 --> 27:14.500
and that's gonna be the sweet spot.

27:14.500 --> 27:15.900
Before they turn on you,

27:15.900 --> 27:18.260
like the raspberry is just wrapping all around

27:18.260 --> 27:20.620
the dandelion and trying to strangle it

27:20.620 --> 27:23.100
and the ivy's just waiting for its chance

27:23.100 --> 27:26.300
and the mare's tail is just really disappointing me

27:26.300 --> 27:28.080
because I thought it was gonna get nasty in there,

27:28.080 --> 27:31.100
but it's just kind of not doing much

27:31.100 --> 27:33.000
because it's just a blazy plant.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.340
But then eventually, yeah, Trev,

27:34.340 --> 27:36.180
I think it is gonna sort of realize,

27:36.180 --> 27:40.860
wait a minute, it'll lead a sort of Spartacus revolution

27:40.860 --> 27:43.820
and you're gonna need some sort of spray.

27:43.820 --> 27:45.560
Because they're too powerful.

27:45.560 --> 27:49.660
Yeah, and maybe you could hold a tasty food

27:49.660 --> 27:51.560
for plants over it and just be like,

27:51.560 --> 27:53.620
first one to grow up here and get it.

27:53.620 --> 27:56.380
And boy, I would just love to watch these plants

27:56.380 --> 27:58.420
just fucking rumble in the jungle.

27:58.420 --> 28:01.060
Wouldn't it be fucking rad to put a bunch of plants

28:01.060 --> 28:03.260
at the bottom of the agro crag

28:03.260 --> 28:05.860
and then at the top you put like,

28:05.860 --> 28:07.660
what do plants like, the sun?

28:07.660 --> 28:11.260
Sweet water, I think, like sugary water.

28:11.260 --> 28:14.260
You put some sugary water up there

28:14.260 --> 28:16.380
and just tell them to go hog a while

28:16.380 --> 28:18.140
and see what happens. Go for it, plants.

28:18.140 --> 28:19.920
Just go for it, reach for it.

28:19.920 --> 28:22.340
Don't be afraid to take what's yours.

28:22.340 --> 28:26.460
There's most forms of making things fight is not good.

28:26.460 --> 28:29.760
But even battle bots, I'll watch a battle bots fight

28:29.760 --> 28:33.180
sometime and be like, these toasters don't deserve this.

28:33.180 --> 28:34.700
They should be doing other stuff like-

28:34.700 --> 28:37.420
Make no mistake that when the robots

28:37.420 --> 28:42.220
try to rally others of the sentient ones to their cause,

28:42.220 --> 28:45.500
the battle bots footage will be the footage that they show.

28:45.500 --> 28:48.940
Like, this is what they did.

28:48.940 --> 28:53.460
Especially the shots of when the robots cry.

28:53.460 --> 28:55.180
That's the ones that always get me, you know?

28:55.180 --> 28:56.820
It's like, I don't want to fight him.

28:56.820 --> 28:57.820
He's my brother.

28:57.820 --> 29:02.820
When they cry data just pours out their ears.

29:04.780 --> 29:07.500
Their eyes, they're crying data.

29:07.500 --> 29:09.420
Griffin, I just want to let you know.

29:09.420 --> 29:12.540
Yeah, tears of raw kilobytes of data.

29:12.540 --> 29:15.700
They're crying megs and megs of data.

29:15.700 --> 29:18.180
But I watched Ivy use, you know,

29:18.180 --> 29:23.180
razor leaf on a raspberry plant and I feel nothing.

29:23.200 --> 29:25.780
I feel absolutely nothing except for pure enjoyment.

29:25.780 --> 29:27.180
That's so sad, Griffin.

29:27.180 --> 29:29.900
I'm just saying, I'm here for it.

29:29.900 --> 29:31.600
I feel nothing.

29:33.140 --> 29:35.300
Get him, get him Dandelion.

29:35.300 --> 29:38.340
Do something for me once in your life, Dandelion.

29:38.340 --> 29:39.660
Kick that raspberry's ass.

29:39.660 --> 29:41.780
I have 50 cold ones on you.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.420
Dandelions do all kinds of great shit.

29:43.420 --> 29:44.860
You can make wine out of them.

29:44.860 --> 29:46.380
You can rub them on your friend's arm

29:46.380 --> 29:48.820
and pretend that the flower peed on them.

29:48.820 --> 29:49.980
No, that's a good one.

29:49.980 --> 29:51.660
I love that shit. It's a very good one.

29:51.660 --> 29:55.500
Especially, Dan, when your friend is like, I like this.

29:55.500 --> 29:59.300
Huh, huh, huh, yeah, okay.

29:59.300 --> 30:01.020
I say yes about this.

30:02.100 --> 30:03.060
Huh.

30:03.060 --> 30:04.900
Hey, take us to Mighty Zone, please.

30:04.900 --> 30:06.780
Well, let's go.

30:06.780 --> 30:19.620
This week, we're sponsored by Casper.

30:19.620 --> 30:21.020
Oh my God, I just had the impulse

30:21.020 --> 30:22.540
to make a friendly ghost reference.

30:22.540 --> 30:23.860
And like Casper-

30:23.860 --> 30:25.580
Wouldn't be the first one to do that.

30:25.580 --> 30:26.780
So that would be fun.

30:26.780 --> 30:28.420
I'm disappointed in myself.

30:28.420 --> 30:29.780
I don't know how I'm going to sleep tonight,

30:29.780 --> 30:31.300
but the answer is well,

30:31.300 --> 30:33.060
because I sleep on a Casper mattress.

30:33.060 --> 30:35.700
Casper has revolutionized its line of products

30:35.700 --> 30:38.180
to create an exceptionally comfortable sleep experience

30:38.180 --> 30:40.500
one night at a time.

30:40.500 --> 30:41.820
They offer affordable prices

30:41.820 --> 30:43.940
because Casper cuts out the middleman

30:43.940 --> 30:45.340
and sells directly to the consumer.

30:45.340 --> 30:46.540
Now don't get me wrong.

30:46.540 --> 30:49.260
I feel bad for the middleman in this economy

30:49.260 --> 30:50.460
to be cut out like that.

30:50.460 --> 30:51.660
But also that middleman,

30:51.660 --> 30:54.540
the specific one that Casper cuts out is a jerk.

30:54.540 --> 30:55.940
Davis.

30:55.940 --> 30:57.260
His name is Davis.

30:57.260 --> 30:58.700
Davis, yeah, and he's a jerk.

30:58.700 --> 31:00.060
So you don't have to feel bad about Davis

31:00.060 --> 31:05.060
not getting to dip his snoot in the old mattress till.

31:05.060 --> 31:06.700
And I love Casper mattresses.

31:06.700 --> 31:07.740
I sleep on one every night.

31:07.740 --> 31:09.060
Every time we go on a tour,

31:09.060 --> 31:11.620
I come home and I sleep so much better.

31:11.620 --> 31:14.100
And I remember like, oh yeah, this is what sleep is

31:14.100 --> 31:16.520
because they can buy multiple supportive memory phones

31:16.520 --> 31:17.840
for a quality sleep service

31:17.840 --> 31:19.900
with the right amounts of both sync and bounce.

31:19.900 --> 31:21.260
You can be sure of your purchase

31:21.260 --> 31:24.420

31:35.820 --> 31:37.300
I sleep extra good at my Casper

31:37.300 --> 31:39.860
just knowing that I'm making Davis go hungry.

31:39.860 --> 31:42.420
Yeah, take that Davis you jerk-o.

31:42.420 --> 31:43.940
I'm gonna tell you about stamps.com.

31:43.940 --> 31:45.900
No, I wanna tell him about stamps.com.

31:45.900 --> 31:47.900
No, I wanna tell him about stamps.com.

31:47.900 --> 31:49.260
And you just did one.

31:49.260 --> 31:51.180
Should we all just talk about stamps.com

31:51.180 --> 31:52.180
at the same time? Simultaneously.

31:52.180 --> 31:53.780
Yes, okay. So Griffin go.

31:53.780 --> 31:56.460
It'll be the first time we've ever talked over each other.

31:56.460 --> 31:58.060
Stamps.com's great.

31:58.060 --> 32:00.020
They'll give you the stamps whenever you need them

32:00.020 --> 32:01.220
and you print them out right there

32:01.220 --> 32:03.000
and you don't have to worry about going to the post office

32:03.000 --> 32:04.400
to mail your letters and packages

32:04.400 --> 32:06.260
because you can get postage on demand

32:06.260 --> 32:08.620
and you even weigh the shit

32:08.620 --> 32:11.620
and you put the stamps right on the package

32:11.620 --> 32:14.020
after wrapping it up in package stuff

32:14.020 --> 32:15.960
and you ship it right on the fuck off

32:15.960 --> 32:18.300
and you don't even have to sweat it, dude.

32:18.300 --> 32:20.740
You get all the amazing services at post office

32:20.740 --> 32:22.460

32:26.780 --> 32:27.620
and printer.

32:27.620 --> 32:28.980
It's very convenient.

32:28.980 --> 32:31.980
It's come as you are.

32:31.980 --> 32:34.060
Open door policy at stamps.com.

32:34.060 --> 32:35.660
Everything's on demand.

32:35.660 --> 32:38.660
So right now I'll use my brother for this special offer

32:38.660 --> 32:40.260
and by my brother, I mean Justin.

32:40.260 --> 32:41.780
Just hit him up.

32:41.780 --> 32:43.060
Oh, stamps.com?

32:43.060 --> 32:44.180
Yeah, I know a guy.

32:44.180 --> 32:45.020
Hold on.

32:45.020 --> 32:48.060
Let me get you a $50 free postage.

32:48.060 --> 32:49.980
What he does is he holds out a calculator

32:49.980 --> 32:51.340
and you punch in some numbers

32:51.340 --> 32:53.900
and the stamp comes right out of his fucking mouth.

32:55.140 --> 32:56.940
He's got a Game Boy printer he swallowed

32:56.940 --> 32:58.500
all the way back in 2002

32:58.500 --> 33:00.340
and that thing does its job.

33:00.340 --> 33:02.100
Great flags of the world.

33:02.100 --> 33:03.060
That's the theme.

33:03.060 --> 33:03.900
That's the only theme I can think of.

33:03.900 --> 33:04.900
Yeah, that's the theme this month.

33:04.900 --> 33:06.620
You gotta punch him in the stomach real hard

33:06.620 --> 33:09.140
if you want to change it to Harry Potter stamps.

33:09.140 --> 33:10.900

33:26.460 --> 33:27.380
Okay.

33:27.380 --> 33:30.380
I want to tell you all about 8 Bit Geek,

33:30.380 --> 33:33.620
a podcast that shares its insignificant views

33:33.620 --> 33:35.540
on gaming and film.

33:35.540 --> 33:38.420
Stop in as we share some laughs

33:38.420 --> 33:42.340
and we read missed connections from Craigslist and more.

33:42.340 --> 33:44.780
And you can find that at 8 Big Geek

33:44.780 --> 33:48.620
on Spotify, iTunes and Google Play.

33:48.620 --> 33:53.620
Visit www.the8, that's the numeral, bitgeek.com

33:53.620 --> 33:58.620
and you can get more info and listen to this podcast.

34:01.620 --> 34:04.660
Is the missed connections from geek stuff,

34:04.660 --> 34:08.500
so like Luigi to Princess Fiona from Shrek,

34:08.500 --> 34:09.900
just like like your style.

34:09.900 --> 34:11.580
I know that you're married, but do you like-

34:11.580 --> 34:12.860
You're into green dudes.

34:12.860 --> 34:13.780
I'm a green dude.

34:13.780 --> 34:14.740
I'm a green dude.

34:14.740 --> 34:17.700
Do you and your husband like to have fun?

34:17.700 --> 34:20.220
I will say though, if you click through to this website,

34:20.220 --> 34:22.060
you're going to see some beards.

34:22.060 --> 34:26.860
There will be beards and they are increasingly impressive.

34:26.860 --> 34:28.480
There's Jeremy, Doug and Kevin.

34:28.480 --> 34:30.800
Jeremy has a respectable beard.

34:30.800 --> 34:33.240
Doug's got a massive beard and mustache.

34:33.240 --> 34:35.300
Kevin has shaved the mustache.

34:35.300 --> 34:37.560
So you can't fucking think of about anything

34:37.560 --> 34:41.180
other than Kevin's amazing beard.

34:41.180 --> 34:42.980
Yeah, I have a Jumbotron here.

34:42.980 --> 34:47.340
This one's from Melhaliwa and it's from Dave who says,

34:47.340 --> 34:50.300
Hey, sweetie pie, I'm writing this Jumbotron at 4 a.m.

34:50.300 --> 34:52.100
the day before your birthday and two days

34:52.100 --> 34:53.060
before our wedding day.

34:53.060 --> 34:55.840
It will hopefully run on our planned wedding day.

34:55.840 --> 34:57.340
I'm so glad-

34:57.340 --> 34:58.900
Wait, oh wow.

34:58.900 --> 35:00.720
What came in under the wire on this one?

35:00.720 --> 35:04.820
I'm so glad we snuck in a bonus six months of wedded bliss.

35:04.820 --> 35:08.380
Thank you for marathoning the first 200 Mabim Bams with me.

35:08.380 --> 35:09.220
Mistake!

35:10.380 --> 35:12.900
And for getting Papa McElroy to retweet pictures

35:12.900 --> 35:14.940
of our dog XOXO.

35:14.940 --> 35:16.860
I wanted that on May 12th,

35:16.860 --> 35:19.700
which I guess is the planned wedding day.

35:19.700 --> 35:23.620
And I think we came in pretty close to that.

35:23.620 --> 35:25.340
Not exactly on it, but whatever.

35:25.340 --> 35:26.660
I'd rather do it before,

35:26.660 --> 35:28.420
because our next episode is the 14th

35:28.420 --> 35:29.460
and we would have missed it.

35:29.460 --> 35:30.300
What a bum missed it.

35:30.300 --> 35:31.740
That's a true point, Travis.

35:31.740 --> 35:35.980
And a little weird that you're marrying a pie, Dave.

35:35.980 --> 35:38.140
That's a joke, because he said sweetie pie.

35:38.140 --> 35:40.220
But I've eaten, yeah, I eat a pie so good

35:40.220 --> 35:41.260
that I would marry it.

35:41.260 --> 35:46.260
Yes, this final Jumbotron, it's for Catherine.

35:46.500 --> 35:47.980
It's from Kai.

35:47.980 --> 35:51.780
And it says, happy birthday and or general existence

35:51.780 --> 35:53.940
to my longest best friend.

35:53.940 --> 35:57.020
Now, I assume there that you mean someone

35:57.020 --> 35:58.580
who's been your best friend the longest

35:58.580 --> 36:02.260
and not like a 10 foot tall best friend.

36:02.260 --> 36:04.740
Well, it says longest, so they could be,

36:04.740 --> 36:08.820
you know, five foot four tall, but 10 feet deep.

36:08.820 --> 36:11.300
What a deep friend I have.

36:11.300 --> 36:13.260
A very deep, deep friend.

36:13.260 --> 36:16.180
Thanks for putting up with me when I don't text back,

36:16.180 --> 36:19.860
playing D&D with me, introducing me to German musicals,

36:19.860 --> 36:23.420
giving me up to date on content from these good, good boys.

36:23.420 --> 36:26.340
I hope you know how proud I am of you for everything you do.

36:26.340 --> 36:29.260
Never forget, you're a fucking badass.

36:29.260 --> 36:31.700
Hey, folks, don't rely on your friend, Catherine,

36:31.700 --> 36:32.860
to tell you what's going on with us.

36:32.860 --> 36:34.940
We got lots of social media.

36:34.940 --> 36:37.040
You don't have to wait for Catherine to tell you.

36:37.040 --> 36:39.780
But Catherine, if you do wanna handle telling everybody

36:39.780 --> 36:42.100
what's going on, we appreciate the effort.

36:42.100 --> 36:44.220
If that's a service you offer, Catherine,

36:44.220 --> 36:46.180
we can push more people your way.

36:46.180 --> 36:48.580
Yeah, if you wanna sort of take up that mantle

36:48.580 --> 36:50.540
of keeping people informed.

36:50.540 --> 36:52.900
So everybody just go on Twitter, search Catherine,

36:52.900 --> 36:54.780
and follow the first person that comes up.

36:54.780 --> 36:56.420
That's probably Catherine.

36:56.420 --> 36:58.940
And you're gonna get all the great news from us.

36:58.940 --> 37:01.300
And then be sure to ask that Catherine constantly,

37:01.300 --> 37:02.780
like, so what's up with the McElroy's?

37:02.780 --> 37:05.280
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

37:05.280 --> 37:07.260

How about a Yahoo? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

37:43.860 --> 37:45.340
This one was sent in by Grin Velesty also.

37:45.340 --> 37:46.700
Thank you, Grin.

37:46.700 --> 37:48.640
It's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user,

37:48.640 --> 37:51.900
but I'm gonna say Davis sent this one in.

37:51.900 --> 37:53.300
So sad, so hungry.

37:53.300 --> 37:56.460
Davis asks, what would it be like

37:56.460 --> 37:59.820
if Deadpool took over the Cracker Barrel franchise?

37:59.820 --> 38:02.900
Oh, fuck, this is good.

38:02.900 --> 38:05.860
You know we'd be in there with his like twisted views.

38:05.860 --> 38:06.700
Well, let me finish,

38:06.700 --> 38:08.020
and then we'll get into the twisted views,

38:08.020 --> 38:09.420
but I'm about to work there.

38:09.420 --> 38:11.340
I just wonder how hilarious it would be

38:11.340 --> 38:12.780
if he were running things.

38:12.780 --> 38:14.620
Oh, yeah.

38:14.620 --> 38:17.540
Yeah, so he'd be like, hey, this is Deadpool.

38:17.540 --> 38:20.260
Come on down for a good country breakfast,

38:20.260 --> 38:23.020
eggs, toast, and my balls.

38:23.020 --> 38:25.940
Yeah, yeah.

38:25.940 --> 38:28.360
But he also probably wouldn't have fired that one woman

38:28.360 --> 38:30.940
for no reason that the internet went wild about.

38:30.940 --> 38:32.940
Like Deadpool wouldn't have done that,

38:32.940 --> 38:35.180
but he would have made people look at his butt

38:35.180 --> 38:36.660
while he brought them biscuits.

38:36.660 --> 38:39.860
Yeah, you'd be doing the peg puzzle thing

38:39.860 --> 38:42.780
to find out how smart you are in the little wooden triangle,

38:42.780 --> 38:44.520
and you'd be getting close to finishing it,

38:44.520 --> 38:47.700
and you went to put the last peg in, but it was his butt.

38:47.700 --> 38:51.700
Yeah, but he wouldn't have fired that woman for no reason.

38:51.700 --> 38:53.220
Yeah, that was bad Cracker Barrel.

38:53.220 --> 38:56.020
You get some like old-timey candy, but then what's that?

38:56.020 --> 38:59.100
He's eating it, and also his butt's there.

38:59.100 --> 38:59.940
Yeah, he's eating it.

38:59.940 --> 39:01.940
You think he's behind the,

39:01.940 --> 39:04.860
like he just helped you be your waiter,

39:04.860 --> 39:07.180
and then when you go to the counter to buy

39:07.180 --> 39:10.620
those Jawbreakers our dad likes, it's him,

39:10.620 --> 39:12.820
but he's got a fake mustache on.

39:12.820 --> 39:13.660
Oh, yeah.

39:13.660 --> 39:15.100
And he's talking kind of like an old-timey voice,

39:15.100 --> 39:17.260
like, I'll help you, kid.

39:17.260 --> 39:18.620
Yeah, a guy comes up to him,

39:18.620 --> 39:20.060
he's sitting in one of those rocking chairs

39:20.060 --> 39:21.340
out in front of the Cracker Barrel,

39:21.340 --> 39:23.180
and he's like, hey, rocking chair,

39:23.180 --> 39:24.660
why don't you get back to work?

39:24.660 --> 39:26.660
And then Deadpool's like, my balls,

39:26.660 --> 39:29.540
and he pulls out two big guns and just wastes them.

39:29.540 --> 39:31.020
Yeah, yeah.

39:31.020 --> 39:34.580
Oh, and then there's some problems

39:34.580 --> 39:39.580
with overages, with too much being spent on labor

39:41.180 --> 39:46.180
for like some of the down periods for Cracker Barrel,

39:46.660 --> 39:51.440
and he finds a way of just sort of shoring that up,

39:51.440 --> 39:55.260
the equitable for all the employees,

39:55.260 --> 39:58.340
and also for the overhead.

39:58.340 --> 39:59.740
Yeah. Just better.

39:59.740 --> 40:03.860
And then at the end of, okay, you guys tell me

40:03.860 --> 40:07.660
what I was gonna finish my 15-minute-long ramble with,

40:07.660 --> 40:09.540
because I had a great.

40:09.540 --> 40:10.900
Nah, dude, stick the landing.

40:10.900 --> 40:11.740
It's you, baby.

40:11.740 --> 40:13.820
No, come on, you got it, Justin.

40:13.820 --> 40:14.980
He farts.

40:14.980 --> 40:15.820
Okay.

40:15.820 --> 40:18.300
That's what happens at the end of mine is he farts.

40:18.300 --> 40:22.780
In context, it would have been very good.

40:22.780 --> 40:25.080
I was trying to get to like, yes, he farts,

40:25.080 --> 40:27.100
and his butt and his balls and stuff,

40:27.100 --> 40:29.700
but also he turns out to be really good

40:29.700 --> 40:31.780
at running the Cracker Barrel franchise.

40:31.780 --> 40:34.140
That's just the inverse of mine, though.

40:34.140 --> 40:37.060
You just put the balls and the farts at the beginning.

40:37.060 --> 40:38.620
Oh, what if they ran out of syrup,

40:38.620 --> 40:41.840
and he's like, huh, I know how to get some more syrup,

40:41.840 --> 40:43.940
and he finds a new syrup supplier.

40:43.940 --> 40:45.200
Yeah.

40:45.200 --> 40:46.040
And then he stabs him with his katanas.

40:46.040 --> 40:47.780
And then somebody's like, I'm worried about my healthcare,

40:47.780 --> 40:49.860
and he's like, I got your healthcare right here,

40:49.860 --> 40:52.780
and he hands them like a packet with all the information

40:52.780 --> 40:54.260
about the new healthcare plan.

40:54.260 --> 40:56.500
And TJ Miller shows up, and everyone's like,

40:56.500 --> 40:58.280
get the fuck out of here.

40:58.280 --> 41:00.540
You get the fuck out of here.

41:00.540 --> 41:01.380
No, thank you.

41:01.380 --> 41:02.960
Recently, I attended my good friend

41:02.960 --> 41:04.900
and fellow friend of the show's housewarming.

41:04.900 --> 41:06.380
I hadn't been there for very long

41:06.380 --> 41:08.260
before another friend asked me

41:08.260 --> 41:12.020
if I had seen the terrible thing he did in the bathroom.

41:12.020 --> 41:12.860
Oh, Jesus.

41:12.860 --> 41:14.100
Now, I want to clarify here,

41:14.100 --> 41:16.900
because I think the pronoun is difficult.

41:16.900 --> 41:19.600
The he refers to the good friend,

41:19.600 --> 41:22.880
and not the other friend asking about it.

41:22.880 --> 41:26.060
Nervously, I followed up to find out

41:26.060 --> 41:29.580
that our friend had installed a padded toilet seat

41:29.580 --> 41:31.300
in his bathroom.

41:31.300 --> 41:33.380
The bathroom separate from his bedroom

41:33.380 --> 41:36.340
that also served as a guest bathroom for the house.

41:36.340 --> 41:38.200
We tried to tell him that it was unacceptable,

41:38.200 --> 41:39.660
but he wouldn't hear it.

41:39.660 --> 41:41.620
Tell me, brothers, in today's enlightened times,

41:41.620 --> 41:44.780
is it acceptable to have a cheap padded toilet seat

41:44.780 --> 41:48.500
in the one bathroom every guest in your house will use,

41:48.500 --> 41:50.660
or am I in the wrong for not loving it?

41:50.660 --> 41:53.480
We decided to let you be the judges.

41:53.480 --> 41:55.820
I don't understand the, what's the problem?

41:55.820 --> 41:59.260
You don't understand the problem, Justin?

41:59.260 --> 42:00.100
What's the problem?

42:00.100 --> 42:01.660
Let me tell you the problem.

42:01.660 --> 42:02.900
Tell me the problem. The problem is,

42:02.900 --> 42:05.020
and this is a man coming from a man

42:05.020 --> 42:06.760
who owns a bidet and loves it,

42:06.760 --> 42:08.780
but in an ideal scenario,

42:08.780 --> 42:11.900
toilet seats would be a one-use, single-use item,

42:11.900 --> 42:12.900
and then replaced.

42:12.900 --> 42:15.340
You tear it off the toilet and throw it out the window.

42:15.340 --> 42:19.380
Right, a padded toilet seat is the polar opposite

42:19.380 --> 42:21.320
of a single-use toilet seat,

42:21.320 --> 42:23.540
because when you sit on it and get up,

42:23.540 --> 42:26.740
it will suck back in particles

42:26.740 --> 42:29.700
as it reinflates from your weight being on it

42:29.700 --> 42:30.660
and getting off.

42:30.660 --> 42:33.980
And so not only is it being used, it is saving.

42:33.980 --> 42:38.580
It is downloading every time it is used,

42:38.580 --> 42:43.180
until eventually it's just full of butt particles.

42:43.180 --> 42:44.580
Data, yeah.

42:44.580 --> 42:46.380
Full of butt data.

42:46.380 --> 42:47.900
Yeah, it's not good.

42:47.900 --> 42:49.560
Every part of it, when you sit down

42:49.560 --> 42:51.520
and you expect a firm friend down there

42:51.520 --> 42:52.660
to help you do your thing,

42:52.660 --> 42:56.540
and instead you get a pfft, nope,

42:56.540 --> 42:58.700
and the butt particles, Justin,

42:58.700 --> 43:00.220
how are you not incensed?

43:00.220 --> 43:02.700
I need, Neil deGrasse Tyson sounded off

43:02.700 --> 43:05.260
about the when you nut, it pushed you backwards.

43:05.260 --> 43:06.100
Yeah.

43:06.100 --> 43:10.860
He actually did this back in 2011, so thoughtcrime.

43:10.860 --> 43:13.620
I need him to let me know about the butt particles,

43:13.620 --> 43:16.460
because I think that's gonna be the final word on this one.

43:16.460 --> 43:18.500
I guess I see what you're saying.

43:18.500 --> 43:20.860
How are you not upset about this?

43:20.860 --> 43:25.740
I mean, you're breathing dookie 24 hours a day.

43:25.740 --> 43:29.100
Like, open your mouth and you're breathing dookie.

43:29.100 --> 43:30.940
You should do a medical history podcast.

43:30.940 --> 43:33.820
Everything is dookie, for real.

43:33.820 --> 43:35.100
Like, it's all dookie.

43:35.100 --> 43:36.760
The fact that you can be incensed by this

43:36.760 --> 43:39.600
is a level of naivete that makes me wanna

43:39.600 --> 43:41.900
craft a backpack for you out of forest leaves

43:41.900 --> 43:43.860
and put you in it and carry around,

43:43.860 --> 43:45.740
and you'll be like my little partner

43:45.740 --> 43:47.300
who I teach about the world,

43:47.300 --> 43:49.760
and I raise from a whelp.

43:49.760 --> 43:52.660
Can we all start carrying our own seats?

43:52.660 --> 43:53.960
Yes.

43:53.960 --> 43:57.620
With us, and we could start putting powerful magnets

43:57.620 --> 44:01.820
on all the toilets that will snap onto the seat

44:01.820 --> 44:03.980
and also destroy your cellphone,

44:03.980 --> 44:06.580
but it's a small price to pay.

44:06.580 --> 44:09.420
Okay, this is great, because we're always looking

44:09.420 --> 44:10.700
for new business opportunities.

44:10.700 --> 44:12.780
That's why we started this show, obviously.

44:12.780 --> 44:15.620
We can start personalizing them, and like,

44:15.620 --> 44:18.920
oh, what skin do you have on your toilet seat,

44:18.920 --> 44:20.280
and branding them, and it's like,

44:20.280 --> 44:22.260
oh, it's the new Pokemon toilet seat,

44:22.260 --> 44:23.660
shaped like Snorlax's face.

44:23.660 --> 44:25.780
Oh, when you said skin, I thought you meant

44:25.780 --> 44:27.780
the skin of other people who had used it,

44:27.780 --> 44:28.940
and that could be cool, too,

44:28.940 --> 44:31.580
because it's like, I got Mark Harmon to use mine once.

44:31.580 --> 44:32.820
Oh, that's good.

44:32.820 --> 44:34.340
Y'all ever use one of those toilets

44:34.340 --> 44:36.100
that the seat has like a layer of plastic on it,

44:36.100 --> 44:38.580
and you press a button and the plastic kind of rotates

44:38.580 --> 44:40.980
to give you a fresh toilet seat every time?

44:40.980 --> 44:43.700
I remember they had one in the West Virginia

44:43.700 --> 44:47.960
like Congress building, and I always was scared of that

44:47.960 --> 44:49.320
because I was afraid it would activate

44:49.320 --> 44:50.160
while I was sitting on it,

44:50.160 --> 44:51.780
and it would twist my butt all up.

44:51.780 --> 44:54.140
You know what I mean?

44:54.140 --> 44:56.300
Yeah, I hear you, man.

44:56.300 --> 44:57.140
I hear you.

44:58.140 --> 44:59.940
What if you could make a toilet seat

44:59.940 --> 45:01.380
look like Guy Fieri's mouth?

45:01.380 --> 45:03.140
And that's the end of the podcast.

45:04.040 --> 45:05.620
I don't, and I don't just mean this episode.

45:05.620 --> 45:07.060
I mean, like, there's not gonna be a way

45:07.060 --> 45:08.520
to come back from that organically.

45:08.520 --> 45:10.280
Like, I can't go back to talking about,

45:10.280 --> 45:11.740
like, I had a weird dream.

45:11.740 --> 45:12.960
Like, I can't talk about that.

45:12.960 --> 45:14.300
I can't talk about Deadpool.

45:14.300 --> 45:16.400
I really, it's hard to really think about

45:16.400 --> 45:18.220
even thinking of anything ever again.

45:18.220 --> 45:19.740
Even when I'm not doing the podcast,

45:19.740 --> 45:22.740
like, my brain won't be able to generate other thoughts.

45:22.740 --> 45:24.300
Like, I'll be looking at my son's face,

45:24.300 --> 45:27.780
and he says this first word, and he says like,

45:27.780 --> 45:29.580
daddy, daddy, I love you.

45:29.580 --> 45:31.580
And I'll be like, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

45:31.580 --> 45:33.820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:33.820 --> 45:36.060
Like, I'll be driving, and there'll be traffic,

45:36.060 --> 45:38.860
but I won't see the traffic, and I'll plow right into it

45:38.860 --> 45:41.040
because of what happened just now.

45:41.040 --> 45:44.820
So, like, the show's over, life's over, happiness is done.

45:44.820 --> 45:46.820
Griffith's canceled.

45:46.820 --> 45:48.620
I'm canceled.

45:48.620 --> 45:50.260
I had plans, I was maybe gonna try

45:50.260 --> 45:51.460
and go see A Quiet Place today.

45:51.460 --> 45:52.980
I have, like, kind of a day off.

45:52.980 --> 45:55.380
But I don't think, I mean, it's gonna be so fresh now

45:55.380 --> 45:56.900
that the thought of me even enjoying a movie

45:56.900 --> 46:00.140
for the next, like, two months, let alone, like, two hours

46:00.140 --> 46:02.860
is a dream. Unthinkable.

46:02.860 --> 46:03.840
A dream I had once.

46:03.840 --> 46:06.800
So there's, I guess, two parts of my life now, two halves,

46:06.800 --> 46:09.300
and I thought that it would be closer to 50

46:09.300 --> 46:11.200
when I would sort of divide my life up like that,

46:11.200 --> 46:13.580
but really, it was right here at 31

46:13.580 --> 46:15.580
before I knew this and after.

46:15.580 --> 46:17.900
Okay, that seems pretty authoritative.

46:17.900 --> 46:19.220
Here's one more question.

46:19.220 --> 46:21.400
I don't know, like, you heard what I just said, right?

46:21.400 --> 46:22.980
Like, you can give me another question,

46:22.980 --> 46:25.100
but I'm gonna be here in my own sort of prison.

46:25.100 --> 46:27.460
That's fine, I wanna see what the new Griffin is like

46:27.460 --> 46:28.300
because you still gotta make a living.

46:28.300 --> 46:29.740
Okay, yeah, sure, sure.

46:29.740 --> 46:31.700
Phone calls tend to give me terrible anxiety

46:31.700 --> 46:34.520
and at work, this manifests in a very particular way.

46:34.520 --> 46:36.500
When spelling out a word, I find it very difficult

46:36.500 --> 46:39.860
to do the traditional letter-as-in-a-word thing,

46:39.860 --> 46:41.260
like F as in Frank.

46:41.260 --> 46:43.020
I panic and cannot think of any words

46:43.020 --> 46:44.220
that start with the letter,

46:44.220 --> 46:45.980
which just makes me more anxious

46:45.980 --> 46:48.140
and as it folds in on itself like an Ouroboros

46:48.140 --> 46:50.980
with sweaty palms, I generally try to get out

46:50.980 --> 46:53.780
of having to do it by just saying the letter on its own

46:53.780 --> 46:55.980
and enunciating really hard,

46:55.980 --> 46:58.140
but sometimes that doesn't do the trick.

46:58.140 --> 47:00.340
I know there's a military phonetic alphabet

47:00.340 --> 47:02.860
being in my panicky state, I tend to forget that too.

47:02.860 --> 47:06.460
Please help, what's the way around this terrible problem?

47:06.460 --> 47:09.400
Yeah, yeah, it's a toughie.

47:09.400 --> 47:12.900
What if you just start saying like F as in F,

47:12.900 --> 47:16.420
G as in G, you know, like the letter G.

47:16.420 --> 47:20.380
F as in the one after E and before G, if that helps.

47:20.380 --> 47:22.740
You know, the one that's like in the alphabet,

47:22.740 --> 47:24.260
maybe just start saying the number

47:24.260 --> 47:26.880
and you're like D as in the fourth letter.

47:29.100 --> 47:29.940
Yeah.

47:31.340 --> 47:32.860
Could you learn Morse code?

47:33.860 --> 47:35.460
Uh-huh.

47:35.460 --> 47:37.360
Could everyone would have to, huh?

47:39.780 --> 47:40.740
Sure.

47:40.740 --> 47:42.420
Griffin, are you okay?

47:42.420 --> 47:45.420
Let me try to, Alar, split my mind into two halves

47:45.420 --> 47:47.420
and a half of it will always be thinking

47:47.420 --> 47:49.260
about the thing Justin said, but the other half

47:49.260 --> 47:51.220
is gonna be trying to make comedy,

47:51.220 --> 47:52.860
but it's just gonna be 50% of a brain,

47:52.860 --> 47:54.900
but have you ever heard people try to use

47:54.900 --> 47:59.620
the military phonetic alphabet, but they're not military

47:59.620 --> 48:02.660
and they say things like Quebec, Foxtrot,

48:02.660 --> 48:06.420
Bravo, Bravo, Juliet, November, Oscar,

48:06.420 --> 48:10.260
and it's like, dude, you need to fucking chill out here,

48:10.260 --> 48:14.140
Jason Bourne, Yankee, Zulu, X-Ray, Bravo.

48:14.140 --> 48:15.980
You need to calm the fuck down there.

48:15.980 --> 48:18.300
You're taking so much more time to do it

48:18.300 --> 48:21.380
and some of them don't even sound like other letters.

48:21.380 --> 48:23.540
Like you don't even need to worry about it.

48:23.540 --> 48:25.960
I think I've got Q down.

48:25.960 --> 48:29.460
I think if you say W, I probably know what you mean.

48:30.820 --> 48:32.260
Yeah.

48:32.260 --> 48:35.320
F, F as in Frank, who's ever heard F?

48:35.320 --> 48:37.140
I mean, I guess it comes with an S.

48:37.140 --> 48:37.980
I guess.

48:37.980 --> 48:39.160
Sound like X too, if you think about it,

48:39.160 --> 48:41.060
if your connections have. Oh my God, you're right.

48:41.060 --> 48:42.900
All right, let's do this, a new alphabet.

48:42.900 --> 48:44.180
Fuck the old alphabet.

48:44.180 --> 48:47.420
A, A can, A sounds like J, so A's gotta change.

48:47.420 --> 48:48.340
Now it's called- And why is it, wait,

48:48.340 --> 48:49.300
why is it gotta be in that order?

48:49.300 --> 48:51.820
Cause the order is completely without,

48:51.820 --> 48:54.120
like A does not naturally come before B.

48:54.120 --> 48:55.360
Someone made that decision. Sure.

48:55.360 --> 48:58.360
We just need 26 sounds that don't sound like anything else.

48:58.360 --> 49:01.520
So we can be like, squeak, and crumb.

49:01.520 --> 49:02.740
And Doug.

49:02.740 --> 49:05.340
And Doug, and bug.

49:05.340 --> 49:06.580
Ah, shit. Fuck!

49:06.580 --> 49:07.620
See? Okay.

49:07.620 --> 49:09.960
There's only so many sounds.

49:09.960 --> 49:11.780
Nah, I can make 26 sounds right now.

49:11.780 --> 49:13.840
I'm even with half of you with half my brain.

49:13.840 --> 49:14.860
I'll count. Okay.

49:14.860 --> 49:16.660
This'll be a great finale, I'll count.

49:16.660 --> 49:18.740
Okay, well I'll use some letters,

49:18.740 --> 49:19.900
cause it's gonna be hard work,

49:19.900 --> 49:23.780
but it can be like A, B, crumb.

49:23.780 --> 49:24.620
Okay.

49:24.620 --> 49:27.340
D, wow, it starts off with a lot of rhymes.

49:27.340 --> 49:29.740
Yeah, a lot of rhymes. B, C, D, E, all rhymes.

49:29.740 --> 49:31.300
So A, B, crunk.

49:31.300 --> 49:32.300
Doug.

49:32.300 --> 49:33.300
Oh!

49:33.300 --> 49:34.140
F.

49:34.140 --> 49:38.620
Gumpy.

49:38.620 --> 49:41.460
No, you can't have two syllables.

49:41.460 --> 49:42.640
It can't be two syllables.

49:42.640 --> 49:43.480
No, we do have double E though.

49:43.480 --> 49:45.740
Double E is suck my ass. Okay, you're right, dumpy.

49:45.740 --> 49:46.580
Okay, dumpy.

49:46.580 --> 49:48.100
Huff my duff.

49:48.100 --> 49:49.740
Is that the, wait, is that for H?

49:49.740 --> 49:50.580
Huff my duff?

49:50.580 --> 49:52.060
Huff my duff is H.

49:52.060 --> 49:53.700
Start from the beginning.

49:53.700 --> 49:54.540
Okay.

49:54.540 --> 49:56.680
A, B, crunk.

49:56.680 --> 49:57.520
Doug.

49:57.520 --> 49:58.340
E.

49:58.340 --> 49:59.180
F.

49:59.180 --> 50:01.900
Gumpy.

50:01.900 --> 50:04.380
Hey!

50:04.380 --> 50:08.100
I is good.

50:08.100 --> 50:09.820
J is good.

50:09.820 --> 50:10.660
J's not good.

50:10.660 --> 50:11.500
J rhymes with A.

50:11.500 --> 50:12.420
J sounds like A.

50:12.420 --> 50:13.420
Oh, you're right.

50:16.620 --> 50:18.980
You gotta be able to whistle to do this alphabet.

50:18.980 --> 50:19.820
Okay.

50:19.820 --> 50:20.860
Start over.

50:20.860 --> 50:21.680
God.

50:21.680 --> 50:23.060
A, B, crunk.

50:23.060 --> 50:23.900
Doug.

50:23.900 --> 50:24.720
E.

50:24.720 --> 50:25.560
F.

50:25.560 --> 50:26.500
Gumpy.

50:26.500 --> 50:28.020
Hey!

50:28.020 --> 50:31.820
I love you, dad.

50:31.820 --> 50:33.180
Is I.

50:33.180 --> 50:34.660
I love you, dad.

50:34.660 --> 50:36.020
You're right, this is too hard.

50:36.020 --> 50:36.860
It's too much work.

50:36.860 --> 50:39.940
You did so good, you made nine, you made 10 letters in.

50:39.940 --> 50:41.100
All right.

50:41.100 --> 50:44.020
Jesus, we'll just give him that letter.

50:44.020 --> 50:45.320
People seem to be a big fan.

50:45.320 --> 50:47.500
Cronk two, you would say it

50:47.500 --> 50:49.260
and let people know it's the second one for K.

50:49.260 --> 50:50.700
The sequel.

50:50.700 --> 50:52.460
L is good.

50:52.460 --> 50:57.040
M is good, but then N has to be like evil M.

50:57.040 --> 50:58.800
Oh, daddy.

50:58.800 --> 51:00.660
So you reference your dad in two of the letters

51:00.660 --> 51:03.460
of the alphabet and he's really gonna appreciate that.

51:03.460 --> 51:05.580
The military word for P is papa,

51:05.580 --> 51:07.540
so let's just continue the theme there.

51:07.540 --> 51:08.880
Quebec I like.

51:09.820 --> 51:13.420
Arr, fun pirate joke, people like that.

51:13.420 --> 51:14.260
Very good.

51:14.260 --> 51:18.700
And then we can do like sssssssss.

51:18.700 --> 51:21.200
T just be like, you clap.

51:21.200 --> 51:22.800
So that's gonna make Spelling Bee

51:22.800 --> 51:26.500
sort of like a stomp musical.

51:26.500 --> 51:28.560
A U and W I think can stay.

51:28.560 --> 51:29.920
This is stop being funny.

51:29.920 --> 51:31.620
Okay, now start from the beginning.

51:31.620 --> 51:33.020
Repeat it one more time, Griffin.

51:33.020 --> 51:35.340
No, there's only four more letters

51:35.340 --> 51:36.660
and so I feel like I should finish,

51:36.660 --> 51:39.020
but I'm conflicted because of just how

51:39.020 --> 51:42.340
it's long ago it stopped being entertaining at all

51:42.340 --> 51:43.260
for anybody.

51:43.260 --> 51:44.580
Go ahead and finish it though.

51:44.580 --> 51:48.620
Vape, W, cross.

51:48.620 --> 51:50.540
Okay, that's good, it's easy to remember.

51:50.540 --> 51:51.420
Yep.

51:51.420 --> 51:53.740
Said like the guy on Storage Wars for Y.

51:53.740 --> 51:56.160
Thank you, yes, good, yes.

51:56.160 --> 51:59.860
And then Z is, well you're just gonna remove that one.

51:59.860 --> 52:01.300
Oh, so we won't have that letter anymore.

52:01.300 --> 52:02.460
Excellent, 25 letters.

52:02.460 --> 52:04.180
25 feels a lot better to me.

52:04.180 --> 52:05.100
Yeah, me too.

52:05.100 --> 52:06.660
Folks, that's gonna do it for us this week.

52:06.660 --> 52:09.620
Thank you so much for listening to our show.

52:09.620 --> 52:11.800
We always do our best.

52:11.800 --> 52:12.640
There it is.

52:12.640 --> 52:13.580
We do our best.

52:13.580 --> 52:15.220
Thank you to everybody who came out to our shows

52:15.220 --> 52:17.620
in the Midwest this past weekend.

52:17.620 --> 52:20.220
It was, you were all very pleasant

52:20.220 --> 52:21.940
and you have beautiful cities

52:21.940 --> 52:25.620
that we wish we had had more time to explore.

52:25.620 --> 52:28.920
Next week you are going to hear our show from Columbus

52:28.920 --> 52:31.540
where we experimented with a new audience questions format

52:31.540 --> 52:33.580
that I think went very, very well

52:33.580 --> 52:35.180
and we got a lot of very nice feedback on,

52:35.180 --> 52:37.040
so we're probably gonna do that from now on

52:37.040 --> 52:38.900
and you will hear that next Monday

52:38.900 --> 52:41.020
when you hear the Columbus episode.

52:41.020 --> 52:42.260
Also, speaking of our live shows,

52:42.260 --> 52:43.320
we have some coming up.

52:43.320 --> 52:47.540

You can also pre-order the Sawbones book

53:21.780 --> 53:23.100
on Amazon right now.

53:23.100 --> 53:25.520
Bit.ly forward slash Sawbones book.

53:25.520 --> 53:26.740
I wrote it with my wife

53:26.740 --> 53:28.380
and Taylor's wrote the illustrations

53:28.380 --> 53:30.460
and it's a great book.

53:30.460 --> 53:32.260
It's gonna be a good book.

53:32.260 --> 53:33.420
We also just real quick,

53:33.420 --> 53:35.400
I don't know if we announced this on NBNB AM yet,

53:35.400 --> 53:37.000
but we're doing, so there's a company

53:37.000 --> 53:38.420
called the Mysterious Package Company.

53:38.420 --> 53:40.940
It's an amazing kind of deal where you sign up

53:40.940 --> 53:44.260
and they send you stories as packages.

53:44.260 --> 53:46.820
So you get letters and items in the packages

53:46.820 --> 53:49.700
that kind of tell a story as it all unfolds

53:49.700 --> 53:51.020
and we are partnering with them

53:51.020 --> 53:56.020
to do a Tacos School of Wizardry story with them

53:56.560 --> 53:58.300
and we're really, really excited about it

53:58.300 --> 54:00.860
and you can pre-order that now.

54:00.860 --> 54:02.420
Do we have a bit.ly for that?

54:02.420 --> 54:05.580
Yes, bit.ly forward slash taco school.

54:05.580 --> 54:08.780
That's T-A-A-K-O and you can.

54:08.780 --> 54:11.360
If you didn't know that, you're not gonna pre-order this.

54:11.360 --> 54:14.860
Yeah, that's a fair, that's fair, that's fair, yeah.

54:14.860 --> 54:18.660
But it's $64.99 and it's like,

54:18.660 --> 54:20.180
which is like a little pricier

54:20.180 --> 54:21.340
than we normally like to do things,

54:21.340 --> 54:22.660
but when you're making stuff

54:22.660 --> 54:25.620
and then putting it in the mail and sending it places,

54:25.620 --> 54:27.100
I don't know, you get to a certain point

54:27.100 --> 54:29.140
where it's as low as you could make it, I promise.

54:29.140 --> 54:32.020
It covers two big old packages full of fun stuff.

54:32.020 --> 54:34.420
And it's great because it's a great thing

54:34.420 --> 54:35.380
if you want to get it for yourself

54:35.380 --> 54:38.660
and it also makes a great present, so check that out.

54:38.660 --> 54:39.620
Especially if you can give it to somebody

54:39.620 --> 54:41.340
who doesn't have any idea it's happening,

54:41.340 --> 54:44.300
what a wild gift that would be.

54:44.300 --> 54:46.540
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters

54:46.540 --> 54:48.100

54:48.100 --> 54:49.780
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

54:49.780 --> 54:51.020
It's a very good album

54:51.020 --> 54:54.300
that I cannot speak highly of enough,

54:54.300 --> 54:55.820
I can't speak enough highly,

54:55.820 --> 54:57.420
I can't speak high enough of it.

56:09.460 --> 56:11.940
why should I not fall asleep first at a slumber party?

56:11.940 --> 56:13.180
How do I be fleet?

56:13.180 --> 56:16.300
Is it okay to break up with someone using emojis?

56:16.300 --> 56:18.060
And sometimes we talk about butts.

56:18.060 --> 56:19.600
No, we don't, nope.
