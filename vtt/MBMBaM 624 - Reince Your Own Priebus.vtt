00:00.000 --> 00:05.400
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.400 --> 00:11.100
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.100 --> 00:17.900
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:17.900 --> 00:19.500
What's up, you cool baby?

00:19.500 --> 00:20.700
One, two, three, four!

00:20.700 --> 00:26.400
It's the start of something beautiful.

00:26.400 --> 00:32.800
A small acquaintance has blossomed, it's ripened into a precious friendship.

00:32.800 --> 00:36.000
I could have never seen what was coming for me.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.800
Hangs at the skatepark, hangs by the beach.

00:38.800 --> 00:45.800
My life, it feels like life.

00:45.800 --> 00:50.600
Oh, it's better, it's better with you.

00:50.600 --> 00:56.600
My life, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

00:56.600 --> 01:02.600
This is true, oh, it's better, it's better with two.

01:02.600 --> 01:09.800
My life, oh, it's better with you.

01:09.800 --> 01:15.000
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.100
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:17.100 --> 01:19.700
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

01:19.700 --> 01:23.000
I'm the sweet one, Griffin McElroy.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.500
Oh yeah, so I remember this guy.

01:24.500 --> 01:30.300
So right there, Justin had done kind of different, like me, so I was feeling a little different.

01:30.300 --> 01:33.200
I just had a sip of coffee, and I was looking at Griffin in his tank top.

01:33.200 --> 01:36.800
I remember that, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:36.800 --> 01:37.700
What?

01:37.700 --> 01:38.900
Yo, bite!

01:38.900 --> 01:41.400
Yeah, yeah, explain it.

01:41.400 --> 01:46.700
So we do a lot of episodes, and I was thinking about when we've done over 600 at this point,

01:46.700 --> 01:51.700
and I'm worried now that someone will ask us to go back and do commentary on them,

01:51.700 --> 01:54.100
and I don't remember it at all.

01:54.100 --> 01:56.200
I couldn't tell you what we talked about last week.

01:56.200 --> 02:03.600
So I figured it would be more efficient to just record the commentary during the whole show.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.400
And they're not always great.

02:05.400 --> 02:06.300
They're not always great.

02:06.300 --> 02:09.100
And sometimes he tells us, oh, I've got the intro, and you get really worried.

02:09.100 --> 02:12.800
But this one I remember thinking was pretty fucking funny.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.900
I was busting up inside.

02:15.900 --> 02:19.100
Justin started laughing for no reason whatsoever.

02:19.100 --> 02:23.700
Sorry, if you're cracking me up talking about, and then this other thing happened with my kids.

02:23.700 --> 02:24.600
Sorry, you're cracking me up.

02:24.600 --> 02:25.600
I can talk over myself.

02:25.600 --> 02:28.200
It's fine.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.300
So...

02:30.300 --> 02:33.300
I could tell Justin was having a really good time with it.

02:33.300 --> 02:35.700
Justin was really enjoying himself.

02:35.700 --> 02:37.200
Now, what did you think, Travis?

02:37.200 --> 02:39.300
What did you think of Justin when he kind of like,

02:39.300 --> 02:42.100
you could tell he didn't actually understand what the bit was?

02:42.100 --> 02:43.100
Yeah, I could tell that.

02:43.100 --> 02:46.900
And then there was complete silence for like 20 seconds.

02:46.900 --> 02:53.200
Oh yeah, I remember during this commentary that Griffin and I were talking about Justin not understanding the bit.

02:53.200 --> 02:57.000
And like, it just was clear that Justin wasn't funny.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.500
I don't remember Travis' commentary about our commentary.

02:59.500 --> 03:01.000
He started talking like a grandpa.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.500
Do you remember when he started talking like a grandpa?

03:02.500 --> 03:07.000
I don't remember the evidence of the fact that he did not understand the bit

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
because he started being like an old man.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.300
I'm in the future doing commentary on it.

03:11.300 --> 03:12.600
I get it.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.600
He was really over-complicating it, if I remember correctly.

03:15.600 --> 03:20.600
That's why we love Justin is because he tries his best every time.

03:20.600 --> 03:23.600
He has a great heart and a wonderful beard.

03:23.600 --> 03:26.600
He quit the show right after this, if I remember correctly.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.100
That's it, guys! I'm quitting the show!

03:29.100 --> 03:30.100
Yeah, I knew it.

03:30.100 --> 03:31.600
There it was, Travis. You got it.

03:31.600 --> 03:32.600
You got it right there.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.600
This is fucking stupid. You guys aren't even talking.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.600
We've just been sitting in silence.

03:36.600 --> 03:37.600
Just me.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.100
Solo Mish.

03:39.100 --> 03:43.600
And it turned out he was really mad because his Beanie Baby collection wasn't worth what he thought it was.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.600
And it was really eating at him.

03:45.600 --> 03:50.600
But then, luckily, the market for Beanie Babies, if I remember a couple days later, really took off.

03:50.600 --> 03:55.600
Getting all my babies together, keeping them clean, keeping them fresh, keeping them deodorized.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.100
That's a full-time job.

03:57.100 --> 04:03.600
I got cats that love to hump Beanie Babies, and I just simply do not have the time or bandwidth.

04:03.600 --> 04:07.600
When he got into making cat-slash-Beanie Baby pornography,

04:07.600 --> 04:09.600
and he talked about it on the show a lot.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.600
He acted like it wasn't his choice.

04:11.600 --> 04:14.600
He explicitly talked about first-generation Duchess Bear.

04:14.600 --> 04:18.600
Which is, as you know, a limited edition for when Princess Diana died.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.600
And this is the Beanie Baby about it.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.600
They're extremely valuable.

04:22.600 --> 04:25.600
He really spiraled after this point, because any time he thinks about Princess Diana,

04:25.600 --> 04:27.600
he just starts to get uncontrollably...

04:27.600 --> 04:29.600
Let the conspiracy theory talk for me.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.600
That's when it gets weird.

04:31.600 --> 04:34.600
This is when he outlined the conspiracy theory about Princess Diana.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.600
He outlined it in great detail right now.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.600
And Seth Rogen was a part of it.

04:38.600 --> 04:40.600
Don't talk over him talking about the conspiracy.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.600
It wasn't a tunnel. This is what everybody misses.

04:42.600 --> 04:44.600
It wasn't a tunnel, it was a cave.

04:44.600 --> 04:46.600
And it's like, why is there a cave there?

04:46.600 --> 04:50.600
Okay. Thanks, Rence Priebus.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.600
Thanks for building a cave there, Rence Priebus.

04:53.600 --> 04:57.600
Oh yeah, Priebus is in it all the way to the top.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.600
I did believe the bit about Priebus.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.600
Yeah, of course. Well, it's a convincing name.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.600
Definitely not just a joke name that Justin pulled.

05:03.600 --> 05:07.600
I really miss the days where we could talk a lot about Rence Priebus.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.600
Yeah.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.600
Is that his first name? Is that his first name?

05:11.600 --> 05:13.600
He's saying a name.

05:13.600 --> 05:16.600
I think Justin's not entirely sure, and he just kind of takes a run at it every time.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.600
His name was Rence Priebus.

05:18.600 --> 05:25.600
It sounds like what the parent of a toddler would say during bath time.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.600
Like, hey, rinse your Priebus.

05:27.600 --> 05:34.600
And I remember Griffin said this thing about rinsing your Priebus, and it cracked me up really good.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.600
You can rinse your own Priebus. You're old enough now.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.600
No one's going to rinse your Priebus for you once you get to kindergarten.

05:40.600 --> 05:43.600
Hey, leave your Priebus alone while you're at school.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.600
We've got to be gentle with our Priebuses.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.600
Well, that's just great.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.600
I guess we don't have much of a podcast today because it's just me flying solo,

05:50.600 --> 05:53.600
unless my brothers would please just help me out a little bit.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.600
A few jokes. One or two jokes. That's it.

05:55.600 --> 06:01.600
Sorry, Justin. I'll jump back in. Sorry, I was just so distracted looking at the news today.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.600
Uh-oh.

06:02.600 --> 06:06.600
No, just in general. It's mostly local stuff. Back to school.

06:06.600 --> 06:10.600
Yeah, school supplies and gas prices have changed.

06:10.600 --> 06:11.600
That's absolutely true.

06:11.600 --> 06:12.600
Should we do questions?

06:12.600 --> 06:19.600
Yes. I remember that we have a list of them here, and I would be happy.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.600
Whoa.

06:21.600 --> 06:24.600
Guys, I just wanted to look at the email list, and I want to tell you,

06:24.600 --> 06:31.600
I got a very real email from Dick Sporting, and there's an ellipsis, goods.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.600
Dick Sporting goods?

06:34.600 --> 06:35.600
Yeah.

06:35.600 --> 06:38.600
And then the subject is, you've been chosen.

06:38.600 --> 06:39.600
Whoa.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.600
That feels so good.

06:41.600 --> 06:45.600
Hey, we know you've been putting in the sweat equity on the courts you're in.

06:45.600 --> 06:46.600
Yeah.

06:46.600 --> 06:52.600
Your name came up for a Yeti Hopper M20 cooler custom gift.

06:52.600 --> 06:53.600
Fuck yes.

06:53.600 --> 06:56.600
Whoa. It says it's the newest model yet.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.600
Whoa.

06:58.600 --> 07:02.600
Hurry up. The number of prizes to be won is limited. Confirm now.

07:02.600 --> 07:03.600
Do we need to delay this recording?

07:03.600 --> 07:05.600
Well, I can join their loyalty program for free?

07:05.600 --> 07:09.600
Oh, my God. Jesus, this is new being an idiot to not do this.

07:09.600 --> 07:10.600
Oh, my God. At the bottom it says,

07:10.600 --> 07:12.600
if you no longer wish to receive these emails,

07:12.600 --> 07:15.600
you may unsubscribe by clicking here or writing to,

07:15.600 --> 07:17.600
and then there's an address in Las Vegas.

07:17.600 --> 07:20.600
Can you imagine a world where we're like, I'm tired of these spam emails.

07:20.600 --> 07:24.600
Someone get my pen and stamps and an envelope and paper.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.600
Fetch me my quill.

07:26.600 --> 07:29.600
I'll tell you exactly what I think of them.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.600
Dearest Dick's Sporting Goods,

07:31.600 --> 07:34.600
I have appreciated your info for the last several years,

07:34.600 --> 07:36.600
but now I find it tedious.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.600
And so I must unsubscribe.

07:38.600 --> 07:41.600
Sincerely, Justin McElroy Esquire.

07:41.600 --> 07:44.600
P.S. I would like that tumbler, please.

07:44.600 --> 07:47.600
I get this spam email every week, guys.

07:47.600 --> 07:48.600
I search for Yeti.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.600
There's 30 emails about a fake Dick's Sporting Goods

07:50.600 --> 07:53.600
telling you about this Yeti cooler that I've got to get.

07:53.600 --> 07:56.600
They want you to get this cooler.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.600
You've been chosen, Justin.

07:58.600 --> 07:59.600
I've been chosen.

07:59.600 --> 08:00.600
They can't just pick someone else.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.600
Would you guys say this is our best episode

08:02.600 --> 08:05.600
of My Brother and My Brother and Me yet, or just top 10?

08:05.600 --> 08:08.600
I would say it's probably, I would say it's like number six for me.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.600
I was actually thinking before we started,

08:10.600 --> 08:12.600
like what if this is the best one ever?

08:12.600 --> 08:14.600
Oh, wow.

08:14.600 --> 08:15.600
Still time.

08:15.600 --> 08:16.600
Okay.

08:16.600 --> 08:19.600
My mother-in-law has repeatedly and seriously expressed interest

08:19.600 --> 08:22.600
in buying my car when I'm ready to buy a new one,

08:22.600 --> 08:24.600
which I'd typically be more than happy to do.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.600
The problem is a long forgotten lunchbox in my trunk

08:27.600 --> 08:30.600
has created a bit of a stink problem.

08:30.600 --> 08:32.600
They have stinking quotes.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.600
Like I bet it's just a stink problem.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.600
I've removed the lunchbox, but a light funk lingers,

08:37.600 --> 08:41.600
and I'm not confident in my ability to unstink this thing.

08:41.600 --> 08:42.600
No.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.600
I convinced my mother-in-law she really doesn't want

08:44.600 --> 08:46.600
any of my otherwise great car without having to explain

08:46.600 --> 08:48.600
to her the embarrassing reason why.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.600
It's from what that smell in Wisconsin.

08:50.600 --> 08:51.600
This is what I'm talking about.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.600
And this is one of those things that I feel like,

08:54.600 --> 08:56.600
and I don't watch the television program,

08:56.600 --> 08:59.600
but I've just kind of like absorbed through osmosis

08:59.600 --> 09:03.600
that there has been somebody on Shark Tank who's been like,

09:03.600 --> 09:06.600
my special car distinctifying gel.

09:06.600 --> 09:07.600
You rub it in.

09:07.600 --> 09:11.600
And then like four of the people are like, I'm out.

09:11.600 --> 09:15.600
It's bad business, but then usually Mark Cuban's like,

09:15.600 --> 09:17.600
I want to be your best friend on this.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.600
I got a stinky trunk.

09:18.600 --> 09:19.600
I love it.

09:19.600 --> 09:23.600
I know all these guys have never driven a car for a day in there.

09:23.600 --> 09:27.600
They've never had to commute with their lunchbox in the back.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.600
I know the struggles of the real humans,

09:30.600 --> 09:32.600
of which I am one, Mark Cuban.

09:32.600 --> 09:33.600
Just like you?

09:33.600 --> 09:36.600
And so this gel exists somewhere,

09:36.600 --> 09:40.600
and you can apply it to the fabric,

09:40.600 --> 09:41.600
and it will make the smell go away.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.600
I can't tell you where it is,

09:43.600 --> 09:48.600
but I can tell you that your search for it would not be in vain.

09:48.600 --> 09:49.600
Yeah.

09:49.600 --> 09:50.600
Now I have to say,

09:50.600 --> 09:53.600
if there's one thing you take away from 624 episodes

09:53.600 --> 09:55.600
of My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

09:55.600 --> 09:56.600
and we've talked about this so many times.

09:56.600 --> 09:59.600
This is why you don't put your lunchbox in the trunk, right?

09:59.600 --> 10:02.600
We talk about this at least once a week.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.600
You got to keep your lunchbox at best.

10:04.600 --> 10:07.600
I strap it in, buckle it in in the passenger seat.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.600
Now someone's taken out the passenger seat.

10:09.600 --> 10:12.600
Well, then it's going to go on the center console,

10:12.600 --> 10:15.600
or I strap it into one of the kids' car seats.

10:15.600 --> 10:21.600
This is the number one stink problem causing issue in America today.

10:21.600 --> 10:24.600
Don't put your lunchbox in the trunk.

10:24.600 --> 10:25.600
There it is.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.600
I didn't get to say, we moved so fast past Mark Cuban,

10:27.600 --> 10:29.600
I didn't get to say my great thing about Mark Cuban.

10:29.600 --> 10:30.600
Oh, please do.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.600
Do you know what Mark Cuban's first job was?

10:32.600 --> 10:35.600
He sold trash bags door to door.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.600
That's nothing, Mark.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.600
That's what he says his first job was,

10:39.600 --> 10:41.600
selling trash bags door to door.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.600
That's made up.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.600
That's not a real job.

10:44.600 --> 10:47.600
Imagine a four-year-old Mark Cuban bangs on your door.

10:47.600 --> 10:51.600
He's like, hey, hey, hey, you need trash bags?

10:51.600 --> 10:52.600
I'm your guy.

10:52.600 --> 10:55.600
And this isn't a question I think anyone should have to ask

10:55.600 --> 10:57.600
a door-to-door salesman, but I think I would.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.600
They're new, right?

10:59.600 --> 11:00.600
They haven't been used.

11:00.600 --> 11:02.600
Hey, they're trash bags.

11:02.600 --> 11:03.600
They're convenient.

11:03.600 --> 11:04.600
They're here.

11:04.600 --> 11:05.600
What does it matter?

11:05.600 --> 11:07.600
I don't know about this.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.600
Okay, I did just Google Shark Tank Car Stink.

11:10.600 --> 11:13.600
Did I Google Shark Tank Car Stink?

11:13.600 --> 11:15.600
Oh, it's the FBI.

11:15.600 --> 11:16.600
It's at Griffin's door.

11:16.600 --> 11:19.600
They come to reclaim his computer.

11:19.600 --> 11:22.600
There was a product called Pure Air with a Y

11:22.600 --> 11:25.600
that was on season two, episode 203,

11:25.600 --> 11:29.600
that was listed as it can make the car stink go away,

11:29.600 --> 11:32.600
but it was also the world's only safe and natural product

11:32.600 --> 11:33.600
on the market.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.600
And the gentleman who was pitching the product is-

11:35.600 --> 11:36.600
Wait, end of sentence?

11:36.600 --> 11:38.600
It's the world's only safe and natural product on the market?

11:38.600 --> 11:41.600
It's the only world's safe air freshener on the market,

11:41.600 --> 11:43.600
and he demonstrated this by spraying it in his mouth.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.600
You have debased yourself.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.600
He left without an investment, unsurprisingly.

11:47.600 --> 11:51.600
No clown man can walk in front of those hungry beasts

11:51.600 --> 11:54.600
and be like, this is my stink go away spray.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.600
I put it in my mouth where the hot dogs make a bad smell.

11:57.600 --> 12:01.600
Like, no one's going to give you money for that, sir.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.600
Maybe some baking soda?

12:04.600 --> 12:06.600
Put some baking soda?

12:06.600 --> 12:08.600
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.600
It works in the refrigerator?

12:10.600 --> 12:15.600
Just get an air freshener.

12:15.600 --> 12:18.600
Well, but they point out, okay, in the email, in a PS,

12:18.600 --> 12:19.600
they point out like,

12:19.600 --> 12:21.600
even if we did a really good job cleaning it,

12:21.600 --> 12:23.600
what if like in the heat, you know,

12:23.600 --> 12:25.600
you turn on the heat in the winter, boom,

12:25.600 --> 12:27.600
there's like a lingering smell.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.600
It's been waiting, it's like a sarcophagus,

12:29.600 --> 12:31.600
and it's just like the seal cracks

12:31.600 --> 12:33.600
and all the mummy stink comes out.

12:33.600 --> 12:37.600
Could you like sell it to her and say like,

12:37.600 --> 12:38.600
oh, fair warning,

12:38.600 --> 12:42.600
someone left their lunchbox in there at some point,

12:42.600 --> 12:43.600
and it went bad.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.600
Not, I wouldn't do that.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.600
I'm a responsible adult, of course, but someone.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.600
But somebody.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.600
You could also just-

12:50.600 --> 12:51.600
I blame my kids.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.600
You could just blame my kids.

12:53.600 --> 12:54.600
Yeah.

12:54.600 --> 12:57.600
Justin's kids were in there.

12:57.600 --> 12:59.600
Justin's kids were in there.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.600
I left a bunch of fucking nuggets all over.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.600
Justin's kids were in your trunk.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.600
They were playing a hiding game.

13:05.600 --> 13:10.600
Like a buck on that one episode of Bucky Brewster.

13:10.600 --> 13:15.600
You could also just knock like a hundred off the price.

13:15.600 --> 13:16.600
I don't eat an egg.

13:16.600 --> 13:18.600
Mom-in-law, I don't usually do this.

13:18.600 --> 13:19.600
You seem like a real nice lady,

13:19.600 --> 13:20.600
and this is a real stinky trunk.

13:20.600 --> 13:21.600
So I'm gonna-

13:21.600 --> 13:24.600
This trunk smells like absolute nuggets.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.600
You are going to need to deal with this,

13:27.600 --> 13:29.600
and let me facilitate that.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.600
Now, do you need the coating on the undercarriage?

13:32.600 --> 13:34.600
Cause that's gonna raise that price right back up.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.600
Oh, oh, oh.

13:36.600 --> 13:39.600
You put your key in your trunk, snap it clean off.

13:39.600 --> 13:40.600
Oh, okay.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.600
One thing you gotta know about this car,

13:43.600 --> 13:44.600
this is a problem.

13:44.600 --> 13:45.600
You can't open the trunk.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.600
The trunk is for ballast only.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.600
Purely decorative.

13:49.600 --> 13:54.600
Yeah, it's a, yeah.

13:54.600 --> 13:55.600
Fuck me.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.600
I'm just, I'm watching a video of this man spraying

13:57.600 --> 13:59.600
on his map and it's like,

13:59.600 --> 14:01.600
it makes me, it makes me bummed out.

14:01.600 --> 14:02.600
You'd think that would be a selling point,

14:02.600 --> 14:03.600
but if someone did that in front of me

14:03.600 --> 14:04.600
with a cleaning product, I'd be like,

14:04.600 --> 14:05.600
so it doesn't work.

14:05.600 --> 14:06.600
Just say like-

14:06.600 --> 14:07.600
So it's not real.

14:07.600 --> 14:08.600
It doesn't work.

14:08.600 --> 14:09.600
This is water.

14:09.600 --> 14:12.600
Hey, to continue the must, as seen on TV trend,

14:12.600 --> 14:14.600
you could just get some Flex Seal spray

14:14.600 --> 14:16.600
and spray it all over the trunk,

14:16.600 --> 14:18.600
and it will trap the stink particles.

14:18.600 --> 14:19.600
I love that.

14:19.600 --> 14:20.600
Like lamination.

14:20.600 --> 14:21.600
You're just laminating the trunk.

14:21.600 --> 14:22.600
Laminate the inside of the car.

14:22.600 --> 14:23.600
Yeah.

14:23.600 --> 14:26.600
Okay, so I have a wizard for us.

14:26.600 --> 14:27.600
Okay, great.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.600
His name is, his name is-

14:30.600 --> 14:31.600
Were you about to say Squidward?

14:31.600 --> 14:32.600
Or did I?

14:32.600 --> 14:33.600
Okay.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.600
Malfobians.

14:36.600 --> 14:37.600
Oh, I know him.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.600
I went to college with him.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.600
The Wizard of the Cloud referred me to him.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.600
He ate pennies on dares.

14:43.600 --> 14:44.600
It was the weirdest thing.

14:44.600 --> 14:46.600
That's where he got his powers.

14:46.600 --> 14:47.600
Yeah.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.600
And then one day, he had a really bad bathroom,

14:49.600 --> 14:51.600
and he had to make a change.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.600
Yeah.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.600
So Deli sent this one in.

14:53.600 --> 14:54.600
Because he ate pennies.

14:54.600 --> 14:55.600
This one really-

14:55.600 --> 14:56.600
Change.

14:56.600 --> 14:57.600
Yeah.

14:57.600 --> 15:00.600
This one really affected me

15:00.600 --> 15:03.600
by like a deep and nostalgic level.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.600
I'm really excited to take us back.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.600
This is how to relive the 2010s.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.600
Oh, thank God.

15:09.600 --> 15:12.600
The 2010s were known for a lot of important events.

15:12.600 --> 15:15.600
The rise of social media, Brexit, heated politics,

15:15.600 --> 15:18.600
LGBTQ plus activism, and unique fashion

15:18.600 --> 15:21.600
to find the years from 2010 to 2019.

15:21.600 --> 15:26.600
And those 10 years are where we contained

15:26.600 --> 15:30.600
and sort of like fulfilled all of those different topics.

15:30.600 --> 15:31.600
Yeah.

15:31.600 --> 15:32.600
Right.

15:32.600 --> 15:33.600
Because I think we can all-

15:33.600 --> 15:34.600
Those all got started and are wrapped up.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.600
And solved.

15:35.600 --> 15:36.600
All solved.

15:36.600 --> 15:37.600
Better.

15:37.600 --> 15:38.600
Fixed them.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.600
So this article will show you a couple ways

15:40.600 --> 15:41.600
to relive the 2010s.

15:41.600 --> 15:42.600
You just described,

15:42.600 --> 15:44.600
besides the LGBTQ plus activism,

15:44.600 --> 15:45.600
which nice,

15:45.600 --> 15:47.600
there wasn't a lot of great stuff in there.

15:47.600 --> 15:50.600
Why would I want to relive the 2010s?

15:50.600 --> 15:53.600
The early 2010s were kind of fun, right?

15:53.600 --> 15:56.600
Like 2010, 2011, like we were having some fun with it.

15:56.600 --> 15:57.600
Yeah.

15:57.600 --> 15:58.600
And you know what will be a good indicator of this?

15:58.600 --> 16:01.600
I'm going to look up like the top grossing movie

16:01.600 --> 16:02.600
from 10, 11, and 12.

16:02.600 --> 16:05.600
Well, honey, we'll get to that in this article.

16:05.600 --> 16:06.600
Oh, okay.

16:06.600 --> 16:07.600
So why don't you not do that and ride with me?

16:07.600 --> 16:09.600
Why don't you just ride with me?

16:09.600 --> 16:11.600
You're grabbing the steering wheel right now

16:11.600 --> 16:13.600
and you're trying to jerk it away from the wizard's hands.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.600
And when you do that, he puts a bug spell.

16:15.600 --> 16:16.600
Well, but the wizard's doing that thing

16:16.600 --> 16:18.600
where he pretends to close his eyes and he's like,

16:18.600 --> 16:19.600
I don't know.

16:19.600 --> 16:20.600
And I'm freaking out.

16:20.600 --> 16:21.600
I don't like it.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.600
But he doesn't need his eyes to see, Travis.

16:23.600 --> 16:24.600
He's a wizard.

16:24.600 --> 16:25.600
He's going to do a bug spell on you.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.600
You're going to turn into a big bug.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.600
Oh, like metamorphosis?

16:28.600 --> 16:30.600
Like, yeah, exactly like him.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.600
So dressing like someone from the 2010s.

16:32.600 --> 16:36.600
Wear a combination of athletic and formal clothing.

16:36.600 --> 16:37.600
In the late 20th century,

16:37.600 --> 16:39.600
people began wearing leisure clothing

16:39.600 --> 16:41.600
like t-shirts, jeans, and shorts.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.600
This is not the late.

16:42.600 --> 16:43.600
That kicked off.

16:43.600 --> 16:44.600
You know what?

16:44.600 --> 16:45.600
It's weird.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.600
It feels like we've had shorts much longer.

16:48.600 --> 16:49.600
Yeah.

16:49.600 --> 16:53.600
In the 2010s, people did this too.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.600
Is that what it says?

16:55.600 --> 16:56.600
Yeah.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.600
Wow.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.600
2010s fashion is a bit different from 2000s fashion

17:00.600 --> 17:01.600
because it is called athleisure.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.600
It is a combination of leisure clothing

17:03.600 --> 17:04.600
and fancy accessories.

17:04.600 --> 17:06.600
That's where we get the name.

17:06.600 --> 17:07.600
That's where we got it.

17:07.600 --> 17:10.600
Hey, how about wear festival fashion?

17:10.600 --> 17:13.600
Festival fashion was revived in the 2010s

17:13.600 --> 17:14.600
when people like Vanessa Hudgens

17:14.600 --> 17:17.600
wore flower crowns and boho-inspired clothing.

17:17.600 --> 17:19.600
Wear accessories that hippies wore in the 1960s.

17:19.600 --> 17:21.600
Oh, Lord.

17:21.600 --> 17:22.600
All right.

17:22.600 --> 17:23.600
I think we can do all these.

17:23.600 --> 17:24.600
Get some hoop earrings

17:24.600 --> 17:27.600
and just head to the Coachella in your mind.

17:27.600 --> 17:29.600
Wear millennial pink.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.600
Millennial pink was a trend starting from 2016

17:31.600 --> 17:34.600
when celebrities wore varying shades of muted pink.

17:34.600 --> 17:37.600
The pink ranged from salmon pink to rose quartz

17:37.600 --> 17:38.600
and other shades of pink.

17:38.600 --> 17:41.600
People weren't wearing pink before 2016?

17:41.600 --> 17:42.600
I didn't know that.

17:42.600 --> 17:43.600
Forget Lady Bird Johnson.

17:43.600 --> 17:46.600
No, no, it started in 2016.

17:46.600 --> 17:47.600
Also, speaking of Lady Bird Johnson,

17:47.600 --> 17:49.600
put on large sneakers.

17:49.600 --> 17:52.600
Large chunky sneakers made by brands such as Balenciaga

17:52.600 --> 17:54.600
were a trend in the 2010s.

17:54.600 --> 17:55.600
Not now.

17:55.600 --> 17:58.600
Not now or before.

17:58.600 --> 18:00.600
Reading this is just making me realize

18:00.600 --> 18:02.600
the 2010s, people were like,

18:02.600 --> 18:06.600
it's so shitty out there right now.

18:06.600 --> 18:10.600
Can we just wear and act and be and live

18:10.600 --> 18:14.600
like it is other time periods all kind of at this nexus?

18:14.600 --> 18:15.600
Moosh together.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.600
Moosh it, moosh it.

18:17.600 --> 18:22.600
I want my Balenciaga festival fashion like Vanessa wears.

18:22.600 --> 18:23.600
Wear skinny jeans.

18:23.600 --> 18:24.600
Okay.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.600
Viewing media from the 2010s.

18:26.600 --> 18:27.600
Okay, here we go.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.600
And this is what really fucking takes me back.

18:29.600 --> 18:32.600
Listen to songs from the early 2010s.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.600
The early 2010s were the start of modern pop songs.

18:34.600 --> 18:35.600
What?

18:35.600 --> 18:36.600
What?

18:36.600 --> 18:37.600
What?

18:37.600 --> 18:40.600
The start of modern pop songs was the early 2010s.

18:40.600 --> 18:43.600
Pop, hip hop, and dance songs were the most popular

18:43.600 --> 18:44.600
in the 2010s.

18:44.600 --> 18:47.600
If you were a teen or young adult in the years 2010 to 2014,

18:47.600 --> 18:49.600
you probably listened to these trendy songs.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.600
Plenty of these songs were popular with teens in the 2010s.

18:51.600 --> 18:54.600
Many 2010s songs were about empowerment anchors.

18:54.600 --> 18:55.600
Get you the damn songs.

18:55.600 --> 18:58.600
You said the same sentence eight times.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.600
Just the way you are, Bruno Mars.

19:00.600 --> 19:01.600
So empowering.

19:01.600 --> 19:04.600
July 2010, Teenage Dream, Katy Perry, July 2010,

19:04.600 --> 19:05.600
Rolling in the Deep, Adele.

19:05.600 --> 19:08.600
Hey, 2010 was a pretty good year musically.

19:08.600 --> 19:09.600
I don't know.

19:09.600 --> 19:10.600
Teenage Dream creeps me out.

19:10.600 --> 19:12.600
2011, we got Born This Way.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.600
We got Super Bass.

19:14.600 --> 19:15.600
That song is Super Bass.

19:15.600 --> 19:16.600
Don't get me started.

19:16.600 --> 19:19.600
Super Bass, an 11-year-old song.

19:19.600 --> 19:22.600
Gangnam Style, we've been doing for, as of last month,

19:22.600 --> 19:24.600
one decade.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.600
Yeah, that song rules.

19:26.600 --> 19:31.600
Roar by Katy Perry, Wrecking Ball, Happy, all dropped in 2013.

19:31.600 --> 19:32.600
Here's what's wild.

19:32.600 --> 19:33.600
Can I tell you something?

19:33.600 --> 19:36.600
Two of those, Roar and Wrecking Ball, constitute, I would say,

19:36.600 --> 19:39.600
two of Bebe's top five favorite songs on Earth.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.600
She is an old soul.

19:41.600 --> 19:45.600
I went, Sydney was in Africa when Gangnam Style happened.

19:45.600 --> 19:49.600
And so I got this great delight of like, she comes off the plane

19:49.600 --> 19:51.600
and she's about, she goes to hug me.

19:51.600 --> 19:54.600
And I'm like, wait, no.

19:54.600 --> 19:57.600
And I just hold up my phone in front of her like, watch this.

19:57.600 --> 19:58.600
This is everywhere.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.600
We're all obsessed.

20:00.600 --> 20:04.600
And then, next step, listen to songs from the late 2010s.

20:04.600 --> 20:08.600
And folks, these are going to take you right back.

20:08.600 --> 20:09.600
To three years ago.

20:09.600 --> 20:14.600
I'm talking about Baby Shark by Pink Floyd.

20:14.600 --> 20:19.600
Ever heard of a little golden oldie called Despacito?

20:19.600 --> 20:20.600
Oh, okay.

20:20.600 --> 20:21.600
Do you know that one?

20:21.600 --> 20:24.600
Do you know Bad Guy by Billie Eilish?

20:24.600 --> 20:26.600
I'm going to have to dust off these albums.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.600
And at this point, I'm too afraid to tell people that.

20:29.600 --> 20:30.600
Despacito?

20:30.600 --> 20:32.600
No, I just heard Bad Guy for the first time

20:32.600 --> 20:36.600
in the Sam Rockwell animated picture, Bad Guys.

20:36.600 --> 20:37.600
I heard this song.

20:37.600 --> 20:38.600
Great flick, by the way.

20:38.600 --> 20:39.600
A lot of fun, that flick.

20:39.600 --> 20:40.600
I had a great time.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.600
Yeah, that was the place I heard the song Bad Guy

20:42.600 --> 20:43.600
by Billie Eilish.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.600
Haven't really searched it out before then,

20:45.600 --> 20:47.600
and then I heard it and I was like, it's pretty good.

20:47.600 --> 20:48.600
I get it.

20:48.600 --> 20:51.600
Hey, let's talk about some nostalgic 2010s kids cartoons.

20:51.600 --> 20:54.600
If you're a member of Generation Z, which I-

20:54.600 --> 20:55.600
Am I?

20:55.600 --> 20:56.600
I'm not, right?

20:56.600 --> 20:58.600
People born from 1997 to 2012.

20:58.600 --> 21:01.600
So I'm like, I'm like a rising Gen Z.

21:01.600 --> 21:03.600
Yeah, like so close.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.600
You're on that 10 year bubble.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.600
I'm on the bubble of it.

21:07.600 --> 21:11.600
Specifically, younger Gen Z members, 2006 to 2012.

21:11.600 --> 21:15.600
Okay, that is significantly younger than I am.

21:15.600 --> 21:16.600
You can watch these childhood cartoons

21:16.600 --> 21:18.600
to experience your 2010s childhood again.

21:18.600 --> 21:19.600
Now, hold on a second.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.600
I have umbrage with the very first one on here.

21:21.600 --> 21:22.600
It's Arthur.

21:22.600 --> 21:23.600
What?

21:23.600 --> 21:26.600
Arthur's, I claim Arthur.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.600
Arthur's been running for 73 years.

21:28.600 --> 21:29.600
So old, yeah.

21:29.600 --> 21:34.600
Arthur's been running from 1996 until still, now.

21:34.600 --> 21:37.600
God, Arthur, they are squeezing so much.

21:37.600 --> 21:42.600
They have wrung that sweet anteater family dry, huh?

21:42.600 --> 21:44.600
That episode where they wrung them dry

21:44.600 --> 21:46.600
is one of my favorites, actually.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.600
It really hits.

21:48.600 --> 21:52.600
So we got Adventure Time, Jake and the Neverland Pirates,

21:52.600 --> 21:55.600
Amazing World of Gumball, Wild Kratts, Gravity Falls,

21:55.600 --> 21:56.600
Steven Universe.

21:56.600 --> 22:00.600
A lot of really like retro shit is on here.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.600
We Bare Bears, The Loud House,

22:02.600 --> 22:03.600
The Magic School Bus Rides Again.

22:03.600 --> 22:05.600
Really old school, man.

22:05.600 --> 22:08.600
And then we can go back with some 2010s kids movies

22:08.600 --> 22:15.600
like Frozen or Moana or Coco or Toy Story 4,

22:15.600 --> 22:18.600
which is three years old,

22:18.600 --> 22:21.600
and really hop in the time whip

22:21.600 --> 22:23.600
and let's go watch Toy Story 4

22:23.600 --> 22:25.600
and remember a simpler time.

22:25.600 --> 22:28.600
Once again, Toy Story 4 was like the fourth movie

22:28.600 --> 22:30.600
I took BB to see in theaters.

22:30.600 --> 22:33.600
Not the best way to introduce a child

22:33.600 --> 22:35.600
to the Toy Story franchise.

22:35.600 --> 22:38.600
Not kind of wrapping it up there at the end.

22:38.600 --> 22:41.600
Not that one that's mostly about retirement.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.600
I got a fun game that I bet you Justin

22:43.600 --> 22:44.600
is going to absolutely crush

22:44.600 --> 22:46.600
because the next one is Take Out Your 2010s Toys.

22:46.600 --> 22:48.600
I'm going to read a few of them,

22:48.600 --> 22:50.600
but I'm going to add a fake one in there

22:50.600 --> 22:54.600
and we'll see if you can pick out which one is the fake one.

22:54.600 --> 22:58.600
Juju Pets, Zoobles, Don't Laugh,

22:58.600 --> 23:00.600
because this is someone's childhood.

23:00.600 --> 23:03.600
Juju Pets, Zoobles,

23:03.600 --> 23:07.600
Squinkies, Scramblers, Shopkins,

23:07.600 --> 23:09.600
Hatchimals, Squishmallows.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.600
I only know the last three are real.

23:11.600 --> 23:12.600
I have no idea about the first four.

23:12.600 --> 23:13.600
Yeah, I don't know the other ones.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.600
The last three I knew, but I don't know the other ones.

23:15.600 --> 23:16.600
Juju Pets, Zoobles,

23:16.600 --> 23:18.600
Squinkies, Scramblers,

23:18.600 --> 23:19.600
I think Squinkies is fake.

23:19.600 --> 23:21.600
I would say Scramblers is fake if we're guessing.

23:21.600 --> 23:22.600
Scramblers is fake.

23:22.600 --> 23:23.600
Well done Justin.

23:23.600 --> 23:24.600
Fuck man.

23:24.600 --> 23:25.600
I knew of every one of you.

23:25.600 --> 23:26.600
Squinkies.

23:26.600 --> 23:27.600
Hop in the...

23:27.600 --> 23:31.600
Man, really hang up the trappings of modern life

23:31.600 --> 23:33.600
as you play video games from the 2010s.

23:33.600 --> 23:34.600
Oh boy.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.600
I'm talking about Destiny.

23:36.600 --> 23:39.600
I'm talking about Fortnite.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.600
I'm talking about The Legend of Zelda,

23:41.600 --> 23:42.600
Breath of the Wild,

23:42.600 --> 23:44.600
and Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.

23:44.600 --> 23:48.600
I'm talking about Minecraft back in my day.

23:48.600 --> 23:51.600
I played Minecraft this morning with my son.

23:51.600 --> 23:54.600
And use 2010s video game consoles when you do it.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.600
Of course, I'm talking about PlayStation 4,

23:56.600 --> 23:58.600
Xbox One, Nintendo Switch.

23:58.600 --> 24:01.600
You gotta emulate it on your computers.

24:01.600 --> 24:04.600
I'm gonna end the media part of this now,

24:04.600 --> 24:07.600
but I am gonna jump to use 2010s slang.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.600
Each decade has its special phrases in slang.

24:09.600 --> 24:11.600
The 2010s was no different.

24:11.600 --> 24:14.600
And this will be, I think, for a lot of us,

24:14.600 --> 24:18.600
a sort of Oscars ceremony in memoriam

24:18.600 --> 24:22.600
as we realize that we need to raise these terms

24:22.600 --> 24:24.600
up into the rafters where they will stay

24:24.600 --> 24:28.600
to bring us great shame for the rest of our days.

24:28.600 --> 24:31.600
Humblebrag is one of them.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.600
And on fire.

24:33.600 --> 24:35.600
Amazing or awesome.

24:35.600 --> 24:38.600
That's like, it'd be a jam.

24:38.600 --> 24:39.600
Like, come on.

24:39.600 --> 24:40.600
Yeah, I don't think that's...

24:40.600 --> 24:42.600
You guys didn't have that one?

24:42.600 --> 24:44.600
Yeet.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.600
I'm fine with that one going away.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.600
Although, I will say, if it sticks around long enough,

24:48.600 --> 24:50.600
it's gonna become a crosswords answer,

24:50.600 --> 24:52.600
and I think that would be really useful,

24:52.600 --> 24:53.600
because that double e.

24:53.600 --> 24:54.600
Yeah.

24:54.600 --> 24:57.600
I do get a kick out of my kid using it in commonplace ways.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.600
It's good, yes.

24:59.600 --> 25:02.600
She asked me to give her a towel,

25:02.600 --> 25:04.600
and I threw one to her, and it landed on the floor,

25:04.600 --> 25:07.600
and she said, Christ, you just yeeted it right off.

25:07.600 --> 25:09.600
Yeah, I've heard Henry use it,

25:09.600 --> 25:11.600
and ironically, I love when Henry does it.

25:11.600 --> 25:14.600
Henry will pick up a toy and say, I'm gonna yeet this over there.

25:14.600 --> 25:17.600
I love it.

25:17.600 --> 25:20.600
And then there's 2010's trends, which, I mean,

25:20.600 --> 25:23.600
what's wild is that Harlem Shake is on here,

25:23.600 --> 25:26.600
which does feel like it is about 60 years old,

25:26.600 --> 25:29.600
but then also, um, flossing.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.600
And it's like, I'm not...

25:31.600 --> 25:32.600
That's eternal.

25:32.600 --> 25:35.600
I feel like people are still learning how to floss.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.600
So, like, I'm not ready to hand out...

25:37.600 --> 25:39.600
I feel like some of everyone knows how to do it.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.600
It's not fair to, like, retire it.

25:41.600 --> 25:44.600
I feel like some of these are, like, when someone says...

25:44.600 --> 25:48.600
It's like somebody said, did you know we're actually closer

25:48.600 --> 25:51.600
to the time when people started doing the Harlem Shake

25:51.600 --> 25:53.600
than we are to the birth of Cleopatra?

25:53.600 --> 25:55.600
And you're like, what? No way!

25:55.600 --> 25:58.600
Whoa, no way, but then you look it up, and it's like, it's right.

25:58.600 --> 25:59.600
Wow.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.600
Because she was born in 1971.

26:01.600 --> 26:02.600
Yeah.

26:02.600 --> 26:03.600
A different Cleopatra.

26:03.600 --> 26:05.600
Listen, things are...

26:05.600 --> 26:07.600
It's a complicated time for us,

26:07.600 --> 26:11.600
and I like to go back to when things were streamlined,

26:11.600 --> 26:13.600
simple, black and white.

26:13.600 --> 26:16.600
You knew when you woke up in the morning

26:16.600 --> 26:19.600
exactly what you were in for for the day.

26:19.600 --> 26:22.600
I mean, I'll say, in 2010,

26:22.600 --> 26:27.600
I was 25 years old, and now I'm 38.

26:27.600 --> 26:29.600
And it's worse. It's worse now.

26:29.600 --> 26:34.600
You know, like, if I could go back in time to 2010

26:34.600 --> 26:38.600
to be 25, I would do it, you know?

26:38.600 --> 26:43.600
Yeah, one of my favorite trends was waking up in the morning

26:43.600 --> 26:46.600
and being able to get out of bed within a minute.

26:46.600 --> 26:47.600
Yeah, right, right, right.

26:47.600 --> 26:50.600
I remember when it wasn't...

26:50.600 --> 26:52.600
Like, I'd hit two o'clock,

26:52.600 --> 26:55.600
and I didn't have to diagnose everything I'd done

26:55.600 --> 26:57.600
for the first eight hours of the day

26:57.600 --> 26:59.600
to see if that's why I felt like shit.

26:59.600 --> 27:01.600
You know what I mean? I remember that.

27:01.600 --> 27:04.600
That was my favorite trend.

27:04.600 --> 27:06.600
Body experiences, you had to see what ruined you.

27:06.600 --> 27:09.600
Was it because I had cereal instead of real food?

27:09.600 --> 27:11.600
Like, what's wrong with me?

27:11.600 --> 27:13.600
Was it too much coffee, not enough coffee?

27:13.600 --> 27:15.600
Why do I feel like shit?

27:15.600 --> 27:17.600
Another question or a break?

27:17.600 --> 27:18.600
Where are we at? How are we doing?

27:18.600 --> 27:20.600
Let's go on break. Let's take a quick break.

27:20.600 --> 27:21.600
We've worked so hard.

27:21.600 --> 27:22.600
We've earned it.

27:22.600 --> 27:32.600
It's better, it's better with you.

27:32.600 --> 27:33.600
Hey, Justin.

27:33.600 --> 27:34.600
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

27:34.600 --> 27:35.600
What are you talking about?

27:35.600 --> 27:36.600
I don't understand you.

27:36.600 --> 27:38.600
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

27:38.600 --> 27:42.600
Yeah, thousands of years ago, humans built a tower.

27:42.600 --> 27:43.600
Too tall.

27:43.600 --> 27:44.600
Too tall.

27:44.600 --> 27:45.600
God didn't like it.

27:45.600 --> 27:46.600
They made it too tall.

27:46.600 --> 27:47.600
God didn't like it.

27:47.600 --> 27:48.600
But now, guess what?

27:48.600 --> 27:51.600
We popped up through the clouds on our very tall tower,

27:51.600 --> 27:53.600
and God was like, what are you guys doing?

27:53.600 --> 27:54.600
Whoa, Jack.

27:54.600 --> 27:55.600
You shouldn't be up there.

27:55.600 --> 27:56.600
Get off that beanstalk.

27:56.600 --> 27:57.600
Get the fuck out of here, dude.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.600
This is actually what happened.

27:59.600 --> 28:00.600
Okay, yeah, come on.

28:00.600 --> 28:02.600
Listen, we all built a big tower.

28:02.600 --> 28:03.600
Sure.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.600
God was like, don't do that.

28:05.600 --> 28:06.600
Don't do that, guys.

28:06.600 --> 28:07.600
That's too tall.

28:07.600 --> 28:08.600
I'm up here.

28:08.600 --> 28:10.600
You're getting into my personal space.

28:10.600 --> 28:11.600
Please don't build a tower.

28:11.600 --> 28:12.600
You know what?

28:12.600 --> 28:13.600
I don't want you all to ever work together again.

28:13.600 --> 28:16.600
I'm going to tell everybody to speak different languages.

28:16.600 --> 28:18.600
Now you can't communicate.

28:18.600 --> 28:19.600
Everybody go away.

28:19.600 --> 28:20.600
Makes complete sense.

28:20.600 --> 28:24.600
Babel is an app and software platform and service

28:24.600 --> 28:29.600
that stands in defiance of the Christian God.

28:29.600 --> 28:34.600
And that was when I knew we would have to do a refund on this.

28:34.600 --> 28:37.600
Babel, they call it Babel because it was the Tower of Babel

28:37.600 --> 28:39.600
that God did to the different languages,

28:39.600 --> 28:42.600
and now Babel stands in defiance of the Christian God,

28:42.600 --> 28:47.600
giving you these precious gems that our Lord and Savior Jesus

28:47.600 --> 28:49.600
keeps from us to keep us fighting.

28:49.600 --> 28:52.600
You know, is it possible, Justin, that God got frustrated

28:52.600 --> 28:54.600
with the big tall tower and he was like,

28:54.600 --> 28:56.600
I'll speak different languages.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.600
And then like a couple years later, he was like, I regret that.

28:58.600 --> 28:59.600
I acted.

28:59.600 --> 29:01.600
I was angry.

29:01.600 --> 29:02.600
I hadn't had my coffee.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.600
Babel stands in defiance of the Christian God

29:04.600 --> 29:06.600
by teaching you the language that you need.

29:06.600 --> 29:09.600
In just 10 minutes, you can complete a lesson

29:09.600 --> 29:11.600
and thwart the omnipotent beings' designs.

29:11.600 --> 29:14.600
And you can start having real-life conversations

29:14.600 --> 29:16.600
in a new language in as little as three weeks.

29:16.600 --> 29:19.600
Other language learning apps for AI use their lesson plans,

29:19.600 --> 29:23.600
but Babel lessons were created by over 150 language experts

29:23.600 --> 29:26.600
who have damned themselves to eternal hell.

29:26.600 --> 29:30.600
Other language apps fear God, but not Babel.

29:30.600 --> 29:31.600
Other language apps fear God.

29:31.600 --> 29:32.600
Babel stands in defiance.

29:32.600 --> 29:35.600
Babel laughs in the face of eternal damnation.

29:35.600 --> 29:36.600
Why do some people skip ads?

29:43.600 --> 29:45.600

29:45.600 --> 29:47.600
Babel, language for life.

29:47.600 --> 29:50.600
Hey, listen, this is the new bar, okay?

29:50.600 --> 29:54.600
2022, I'm sorry, advertisers, we're getting weirder.

29:54.600 --> 29:55.600
And you can start backing down.

29:55.600 --> 29:57.600
You can call our bluff if you want to,

29:57.600 --> 30:00.600
but I'm going to get aggressively weird in this year.

30:00.600 --> 30:02.600
I'm gonna go further and say the new bar is

30:02.600 --> 30:04.600
we're only gonna accept advertising

30:04.600 --> 30:07.600
from companies that spit in the eye of God.

30:07.600 --> 30:08.600
Unless you act in defiance,

30:08.600 --> 30:10.600
and it doesn't have to be a Christian God,

30:10.600 --> 30:11.600
whatever you wanna do,

30:11.600 --> 30:14.600
as long as it challenges some kind of all-powerful being.

30:14.600 --> 30:17.600
No, Christian God is the power of babel stunt.

30:17.600 --> 30:20.600
Other gods may be fine with it, I don't know.

30:20.600 --> 30:21.600
Maybe there were other gods who were like,

30:21.600 --> 30:23.600
man, cool tower, dudes.

30:23.600 --> 30:25.600
Guys, I love that tower.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.600
And here comes God, like an angry five-year-old

30:27.600 --> 30:29.600
knocking over my blogs.

30:29.600 --> 30:31.600
Now you say, hola, and you say hello.

30:31.600 --> 30:35.600
Aw, dang, thanks, God, for nothing.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.600
Anyway, what else we got going on?

30:37.600 --> 30:39.600
Somebody else do this next one.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.600
Just get lunch.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.600
Yeah, hey, I wanna talk about Stitch Fix.

30:43.600 --> 30:46.600
You know how God said, like, you all have to be naked now?

30:46.600 --> 30:47.600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

30:47.600 --> 30:48.600
You need your own thing.

30:48.600 --> 30:49.600
Well, God said you had to be naked.

30:49.600 --> 30:50.600
No, no, no, yours is good, actually.

30:50.600 --> 30:51.600
Go ahead.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.600
We all ate the apple, and God was like,

30:53.600 --> 30:56.600
well, now nudity's bad, and you feel nudity,

30:56.600 --> 30:58.600
and you're aware of how nude you are.

30:58.600 --> 30:59.600
And Stitch Fix said, fuck that.

30:59.600 --> 31:01.600
Here's some cool clothes, my dudes.

31:01.600 --> 31:04.600
And so now we can put on clothes in defiance of God,

31:04.600 --> 31:06.600
not be afraid of our nudity anymore,

31:06.600 --> 31:09.600
and be proud, proud of the clothes

31:09.600 --> 31:11.600
that we cover our human forms with.

31:11.600 --> 31:13.600
Take that, God.

31:13.600 --> 31:15.600
So whatever your style, now more than ever,

31:15.600 --> 31:16.600
it's time to rock it.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.600
First, take a few minutes to set up

31:18.600 --> 31:20.600
your Stitch Fix style profile.

31:20.600 --> 31:23.600
Answer a few questions, smile at your defiance,

31:23.600 --> 31:26.600
and what you don't wanna wear, they won't give you.

31:26.600 --> 31:27.600
It's great.

31:27.600 --> 31:28.600
Can I tell you what I like about Stitch Fix?

31:28.600 --> 31:29.600
Sure.

31:29.600 --> 31:30.600
I just did this today.

31:30.600 --> 31:31.600
Yeah.

31:31.600 --> 31:33.600
Stitch Fix has introduced me to, like,

31:33.600 --> 31:36.600
brands of clothing that look good on my body.

31:36.600 --> 31:37.600
Oh, yeah.

31:37.600 --> 31:38.600
And so I still do the Stitch Fix,

31:38.600 --> 31:42.600
but when I need to, like, re-up my t-shirt collection,

31:42.600 --> 31:47.600
then I have this, like, catalog of clothing brands

31:47.600 --> 31:49.600
that I know that I like and look good in.

31:49.600 --> 31:52.600
That's a valuable service they provide.

31:52.600 --> 31:54.600
Most of my clothes are Stitch Fix.

31:54.600 --> 31:55.600
Yeah, 100% at this point.

31:55.600 --> 31:56.600
Come on.

31:56.600 --> 31:57.600
So check it out.

31:57.600 --> 32:00.600
Stitch Fix will send you five pieces to try on at home.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.600
You keep what you love, you send back what you don't.

32:02.600 --> 32:04.600

You're all grown up now,

32:25.600 --> 32:28.600
a professional adult with diverse interests and hobbies,

32:28.600 --> 32:31.600
and one of those hobbies is video games.

32:31.600 --> 32:32.600
You just can't help it.

32:32.600 --> 32:33.600
They're so good now.

32:33.600 --> 32:35.600
If that's you, we're here to tell you,

32:35.600 --> 32:37.600
you are completely normal.

32:37.600 --> 32:38.600
I'm Maddie Myers.

32:38.600 --> 32:40.600
I'm Jason Schreier.

32:40.600 --> 32:41.600
And I'm Kirk Hamilton,

32:41.600 --> 32:43.600
and together we form TripleClick,

32:43.600 --> 32:45.600
a podcast about video games.

32:45.600 --> 32:48.600
If you think you might be a person who likes video games,

32:48.600 --> 32:50.600
we hope you'll give TripleClick a listen.

32:50.600 --> 32:53.600
TripleClick, new episodes every Thursday on Maximum Fun.

32:53.600 --> 32:56.600
Hey kid, your dad tell you about the time

32:56.600 --> 33:00.600
he broke Stephen Dorff's nose at the Kid's Choice Awards?

33:00.600 --> 33:03.600
In dead pilot society, scripts that were developed

33:03.600 --> 33:06.600
by studios and networks but were never produced

33:06.600 --> 33:09.600
are given the table reads they deserve.

33:09.600 --> 33:11.600
When I was a kid, I had to spend my Christmas break

33:11.600 --> 33:13.600
filming a PSA about angel dust.

33:13.600 --> 33:16.600
So yeah, being a kid sucks sometimes.

33:16.600 --> 33:18.600
But now that I'm an adult,

33:18.600 --> 33:20.600
I can do whatever I want.

33:20.600 --> 33:23.600
So yeah, being a kid sucks sometimes.

33:23.600 --> 33:26.600
Presented by Andrew Reich and Ben Blacker.

33:26.600 --> 33:31.600
Dead Pilot Society, twice a month on MaximumFun.org.

33:31.600 --> 33:32.600
You know, the show you like.

33:32.600 --> 33:34.600
That hobo with the scarf who lives in a magic dumpster.

33:37.600 --> 33:39.600
Doctor Who.

33:45.600 --> 33:48.600
My roommate went to cut off a slice of their baguette

33:48.600 --> 33:51.600
as a snack and found out their baguette had gone stale.

33:51.600 --> 33:52.600
Oh man, the worst.

33:52.600 --> 33:55.600
After wielding it like a sword for a hot second, you must,

33:55.600 --> 33:57.600
the next thing they wanted to do was see what happened

33:57.600 --> 33:59.600
if they threw the baguette against a tree in our backyard

33:59.600 --> 34:02.600
to see if it would explode or make a cool noise or something.

34:02.600 --> 34:04.600
They went outside and successfully threw the baguette

34:04.600 --> 34:06.600
against a tree but unfortunately bounced off the tree

34:06.600 --> 34:10.600
over our fence and into the neighbor's yard.

34:10.600 --> 34:12.600
I'm really glad that you included successfully in there

34:12.600 --> 34:14.600
because my assumption would have been you missed the tree.

34:14.600 --> 34:17.600
But I like that you were like, listen, they hit the tree.

34:17.600 --> 34:18.600
That's not.

34:18.600 --> 34:19.600
No question.

34:19.600 --> 34:21.600
And the noise was amazing.

34:21.600 --> 34:24.600
Brothers, do we have to go retrieve this baguette?

34:24.600 --> 34:26.600
And if so, how do we do this

34:26.600 --> 34:28.600
without ruining our relationship with our neighbor?

34:28.600 --> 34:30.600
For context, he's a very scary old man

34:30.600 --> 34:32.600
who already doesn't like us very much

34:32.600 --> 34:34.600
and we're worried he might have seen the baguette toss.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.600
That's from Breaking Bread

34:36.600 --> 34:38.600
and entering in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

34:38.600 --> 34:40.600
Oh, wait, we have another quick.

34:40.600 --> 34:41.600
Can I read the next question?

34:41.600 --> 34:42.600
Yeah.

34:42.600 --> 34:45.600
Because it says, dear brothers, I am an old man

34:45.600 --> 34:48.600
and a lot of people think that I have a scary demeanor.

34:48.600 --> 34:51.600
But really, the way I react to people

34:51.600 --> 34:54.600
is based entirely off of their actions towards me

34:54.600 --> 34:56.600
and my property.

34:56.600 --> 34:58.600
Anyway, our neighbor-

34:58.600 --> 35:00.600
For instance, if someone were to say,

35:00.600 --> 35:03.600
throws a baguette into my backyard-

35:03.600 --> 35:07.600
My sick wife woke up to the sound of a loud thunk

35:07.600 --> 35:09.600
and she got scared.

35:09.600 --> 35:13.600
She's been dealing with a severe bout of gluten intolerance.

35:13.600 --> 35:16.600
So you can imagine my frustration.

35:16.600 --> 35:19.600
My neighbors, who are bad people

35:19.600 --> 35:22.600
because of the food issues that they bring to the world,

35:22.600 --> 35:24.600
they did throw a bread at a tree.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.600
And I don't know-

35:26.600 --> 35:28.600
And listen, they hid the tree successfully.

35:28.600 --> 35:29.600
Don't get it twisted.

35:29.600 --> 35:30.600
And I will say this-

35:30.600 --> 35:31.600
And the sound was-

35:31.600 --> 35:33.600
The sound was wonderful.

35:33.600 --> 35:35.600
Okay, you guys think of more jokes.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.600
I'm gonna take everybody to the dad zone for a second

35:37.600 --> 35:39.600
because I haven't been a dad the longest.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.600
Don't do this with a baguette.

35:41.600 --> 35:44.600
A stale baguette, that's beautiful.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.600
I like more things made from stale bread

35:46.600 --> 35:49.600
than I do things made from fresh bread.

35:49.600 --> 35:50.600
Here's what you should do next time.

35:50.600 --> 35:53.600
Cut it into cubes, melt some butter,

35:53.600 --> 35:55.600
but mix it up with some seasoning salt,

35:55.600 --> 35:56.600
some different spices.

35:56.600 --> 35:57.600
You toast that.

35:57.600 --> 36:00.600
Oh, that's a crouton, baby.

36:00.600 --> 36:01.600
Maybe you-

36:01.600 --> 36:02.600
You know what?

36:02.600 --> 36:03.600
Maybe on top of a nice French onion, too.

36:03.600 --> 36:05.600
Oh yeah, baby.

36:05.600 --> 36:08.600
Oh, really good breadcrumbs.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.600
Have you heard of these things?

36:10.600 --> 36:12.600
They go on lots of great stuff.

36:12.600 --> 36:14.600
Breadcrumbs, grind it up.

36:14.600 --> 36:15.600
This is-

36:15.600 --> 36:16.600
Breadcrumbs, grind it up.

36:16.600 --> 36:17.600
That's the-

36:17.600 --> 36:18.600
Don't waste stale bread.

36:18.600 --> 36:20.600
There's lots of great stuff to do with stale bread.

36:20.600 --> 36:21.600
Okay, now back to toast.

36:21.600 --> 36:22.600
French toast.

36:22.600 --> 36:26.600
Oh, French toast made with stale bread is the best.

36:26.600 --> 36:27.600
Have I ever told you guys

36:27.600 --> 36:28.600
about the best French toast on earth?

36:28.600 --> 36:32.600
You use Panettone, the Christmas cake.

36:32.600 --> 36:33.600
Oh my God, that's good.

36:33.600 --> 36:35.600
Oh, fuck yeah, it's amazing.

36:35.600 --> 36:36.600
God, that's good.

36:36.600 --> 36:37.600
That says holiday to me right there.

36:37.600 --> 36:38.600
It's so good, dude.

36:38.600 --> 36:39.600
That's taken me to brunch.

36:39.600 --> 36:41.600
That's taken me to brunch with my family.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.600
And who's that?

36:43.600 --> 36:45.600
All my favorite celebrities, they're there, too.

36:45.600 --> 36:47.600
This is a wonderful brunch.

36:47.600 --> 36:48.600
Michael Keaton?

36:48.600 --> 36:49.600
Yeah, I made this for you.

36:49.600 --> 36:50.600
Whoa.

36:50.600 --> 36:53.600
Now, here's the thing that I, and listen,

36:53.600 --> 36:55.600
I'm not always the best at reading these.

36:55.600 --> 36:58.600
And so you guys tell me if I'm reading the situation wrong,

36:58.600 --> 37:00.600
but I look at this as either,

37:00.600 --> 37:03.600
either this old neighbor saw the bread throw

37:03.600 --> 37:06.600
and knows you're responsible for it, right?

37:06.600 --> 37:08.600
Or they don't.

37:08.600 --> 37:10.600
And if they already know you're responsible for it,

37:10.600 --> 37:11.600
what are you gonna do?

37:11.600 --> 37:14.600
Go over and say, hey, we need our old bread back, right?

37:14.600 --> 37:19.600
And if they don't know you're responsible for it,

37:19.600 --> 37:21.600
why out yourself?

37:21.600 --> 37:24.600
I don't know that your neighbor is going to need

37:24.600 --> 37:28.600
the fucking CSI ballistics team to come out

37:28.600 --> 37:30.600
and track the origin of this baguette.

37:30.600 --> 37:31.600
There's one dumb shit that lives next to me.

37:31.600 --> 37:33.600
I have a baguette in my backyard.

37:33.600 --> 37:34.600
They've solved the crime.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.600
No, no, no, I would say between those two things,

37:36.600 --> 37:41.600
there are wavy equal signs of like, I'm pretty sure, right?

37:41.600 --> 37:44.600
But oh, the difference, oh, the difference

37:44.600 --> 37:47.600
between the wavy equal sign and the solid equal sign,

37:47.600 --> 37:50.600
my friend, I'm pretty sure that baguette came over from there

37:50.600 --> 37:54.600
versus, hey, my actions resulted in that baguette

37:54.600 --> 37:57.600
coming over there, no question.

37:57.600 --> 37:59.600
Guys, I have a great idea.

37:59.600 --> 38:01.600
This is really, actually really good.

38:01.600 --> 38:03.600
Get three baguettes.

38:03.600 --> 38:06.600
Oh, wow, and put them in your backyard

38:06.600 --> 38:09.600
and then go over and knock on your neighbor's door

38:09.600 --> 38:12.600
and then just be like, you see this?

38:12.600 --> 38:14.600
What has happened to this neighborhood?

38:14.600 --> 38:15.600
What's going on?

38:15.600 --> 38:17.600
Did they get you two?

38:17.600 --> 38:19.600
It's a bonding thing now.

38:19.600 --> 38:22.600
And then you're like, oh, they got you two.

38:22.600 --> 38:23.600
I'm sorry.

38:23.600 --> 38:25.600
What has happened to this neighborhood

38:25.600 --> 38:28.600
where kids are just throwing baguettes into people's yards?

38:28.600 --> 38:30.600
Now, Justin, I thought you were going to say,

38:30.600 --> 38:31.600
this is how we get ants.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.600
And you talk about getting ants.

38:33.600 --> 38:34.600
Oh, yeah.

38:34.600 --> 38:36.600
That's going to get all people fired up.

38:36.600 --> 38:38.600
They hate those little guys.

38:38.600 --> 38:40.600
Get three other baguettes, like Justin said.

38:40.600 --> 38:42.600
Carry them with you over there and say,

38:42.600 --> 38:46.600
hey, juggling accident, I need that back.

38:46.600 --> 38:47.600
And he's like, what?

38:47.600 --> 38:51.600
I'm practicing juggling baguettes for my new act.

38:51.600 --> 38:54.600
And then your neighbor's going to be like, I like that.

38:54.600 --> 38:55.600
Yeah.

38:55.600 --> 38:56.600
I like that and you.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.600
Thanks for doing that near my home.

38:58.600 --> 39:01.600
Well, if there's one thing your elderly neighbor's

39:01.600 --> 39:03.600
going to understand is the need to practice

39:03.600 --> 39:05.600
to get better at something, right?

39:05.600 --> 39:06.600
He's been around the block.

39:06.600 --> 39:08.600
He knows.

39:08.600 --> 39:10.600
And the best part of this is if he's like,

39:10.600 --> 39:11.600
oh, show me the juggling.

39:11.600 --> 39:14.600
You can say, well, clearly I'm not very good at it yet.

39:14.600 --> 39:15.600
I'm not ready.

39:15.600 --> 39:18.600
If one of the baguettes made it all the way over here,

39:18.600 --> 39:20.600
oh, my man, I still have work to do.

39:20.600 --> 39:24.600
You could also just get one baguette if you're on a budget

39:24.600 --> 39:27.600
and then lay down on the sidewalk in front of his house

39:27.600 --> 39:29.600
and put the baguette near your head

39:29.600 --> 39:30.600
and then pretend to be unconscious.

39:30.600 --> 39:33.600
And then when the neighbor comes out and finds you,

39:33.600 --> 39:35.600
nurses you back to health, and you'd be like,

39:35.600 --> 39:36.600
oh, bread boy got me.

39:36.600 --> 39:38.600
Yeah, then you're like, I think the paper boy

39:38.600 --> 39:39.600
has turned a corner.

39:39.600 --> 39:41.600
I don't know what he's doing anymore.

39:41.600 --> 39:42.600
I don't know what his whole deal is.

39:42.600 --> 39:44.600
He used to deliver papers.

39:44.600 --> 39:47.600
Now it's mostly bread.

39:47.600 --> 39:49.600
Do you have a Munch Squad, Justin?

39:49.600 --> 39:50.600
Because there's something.

39:50.600 --> 39:51.600
Yeah, OK.

39:51.600 --> 39:52.600
What?

39:52.600 --> 39:53.600
No, what were you going to say?

39:53.600 --> 39:57.600
There's just, I saw something in the tip line

39:57.600 --> 39:59.600
that felt very Munch Squad worthy,

39:59.600 --> 40:01.600
and I didn't know if you were going to bring it or not.

40:01.600 --> 40:02.600
On the tip line?

40:02.600 --> 40:03.600
We have a tip line?

40:03.600 --> 40:04.600
We have an email address?

40:04.600 --> 40:05.600
Yeah, on the hot line,

40:05.600 --> 40:09.600
on the Bim Bam Munch Squad hot line.

40:09.600 --> 40:10.600
On the Newswire?

40:10.600 --> 40:11.600
You know.

40:11.600 --> 40:12.600
The Munch Squad AP Newswire.

40:12.600 --> 40:14.600
Oh, coming across the Newswire.

40:14.600 --> 40:15.600
Yeah.

40:15.600 --> 40:16.600
Yeah.

40:16.600 --> 40:21.600
I will go ahead and I will mention this briefly.

40:21.600 --> 40:22.600
This is not a Munch Squad.

40:22.600 --> 40:25.600
I'm experiencing this as you are.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.600
Folks, this is just coming to my desk.

40:27.600 --> 40:28.600
I've just been handed this.

40:28.600 --> 40:30.600
I have something else to talk about.

40:30.600 --> 40:32.600
Sorry, this has just come in.

40:32.600 --> 40:33.600
You're on video.

40:33.600 --> 40:35.600
I'm just holding up a picture of a flower my kid drew.

40:35.600 --> 40:36.600
Wait, which one drew that?

40:36.600 --> 40:37.600
Show me that.

40:37.600 --> 40:38.600
That's really good.

40:38.600 --> 40:39.600
Yeah, show me.

40:39.600 --> 40:40.600
That's a really good picture.

40:40.600 --> 40:41.600
Wow.

40:41.600 --> 40:42.600
That's top-notch detail.

40:42.600 --> 40:43.600
Who drew that?

40:43.600 --> 40:44.600
Was that Cooper or Charlie?

40:44.600 --> 40:45.600
It's Charlie.

40:45.600 --> 40:46.600
It's a flower style.

40:46.600 --> 40:48.600
It's a flower style?

40:48.600 --> 40:50.600
This is like her flower style.

40:50.600 --> 40:51.600
I love it.

40:51.600 --> 40:52.600
It's like Iris.

40:52.600 --> 40:53.600
Anyway.

40:53.600 --> 41:01.600
I was recording audio for Cartoon Name Redacted, and she sat across from me and did some art.

41:01.600 --> 41:02.600
This doesn't matter.

41:02.600 --> 41:04.600
Tony the Tiger is going to be a VTuber.

41:04.600 --> 41:05.600
What?

41:05.600 --> 41:06.600
No one says that.

41:06.600 --> 41:07.600
Do people say that?

41:07.600 --> 41:08.600
Yeah.

41:08.600 --> 41:09.600
VTuber?

41:09.600 --> 41:10.600
People still say that.

41:10.600 --> 41:11.600
Yeah, VTuber.

41:11.600 --> 41:12.600
Sorry, Grandpa.

41:12.600 --> 41:13.600
It's pronounced VTuber.

41:13.600 --> 41:14.600
VTuber.

41:14.600 --> 41:15.600
VTuber.

41:15.600 --> 41:18.600
Is that a vampire YouTuber?

41:18.600 --> 41:19.600
Yes.

41:19.600 --> 41:26.640
Calyx and Scott Tony the Tiger will become an interactive virtual YouTuber, or VTuber.

41:26.640 --> 41:31.760
The first show will air on Friday, August 19th from 5 to 7 ET as Tony the Tiger takes

41:31.760 --> 41:35.080
on well-known streamers and competes on Twitch.

41:35.080 --> 41:40.160
He's going up against, these names mean nothing to me, and it says they're going to be playing

41:40.160 --> 41:44.600
a popular battle royale game, so I guess that biz-den deal hasn't closed yet.

41:44.600 --> 41:45.600
Not quite.

41:45.600 --> 41:47.660
They are bringing it down to the wire.

41:47.660 --> 41:53.360
I am going to watch this tiger be like, I'm Goku now.

41:53.360 --> 41:55.080
Suck my Dragon Balls.

41:55.080 --> 42:00.140
I hope Tony the Tiger kicks their asses, right?

42:00.140 --> 42:03.280
There's nothing better to me than this idea of, well, originally this was supposed to

42:03.280 --> 42:08.120
be a one-off thing, but then we couldn't stop because Tony was undefeated.

42:08.120 --> 42:11.980
Tony the Tiger just won $1.2 million in a video game championship.

42:11.980 --> 42:13.100
We don't know what to do.

42:13.100 --> 42:14.220
He's not real.

42:14.220 --> 42:16.520
He doesn't work for Frosted Flakes anymore.

42:16.520 --> 42:18.040
Yeah, the box is empty.

42:18.040 --> 42:20.720
It just says flakes.

42:20.720 --> 42:24.120
It's a plain blue box that says flakes on it.

42:24.120 --> 42:26.040
He took the frosting with him when he left.

42:26.040 --> 42:27.200
He owned the frosting.

42:27.200 --> 42:29.660
We didn't even know his contract is so old.

42:29.660 --> 42:31.780
He owned the frosting.

42:31.780 --> 42:33.040
No one knew.

42:33.040 --> 42:34.040
This innovative concept.

42:34.040 --> 42:35.320
He made the frosting himself.

42:35.320 --> 42:37.760
He exuded it from his pores.

42:37.760 --> 42:41.880
This innovative concept taps into the growing popularity of VTubing on Twitch, where we saw

42:41.880 --> 42:48.680
VTubing content increase 467% year over year last year, explained Adam Harris, the global

42:48.680 --> 42:50.920
head of Twitch's brand partnership studio.

42:50.920 --> 42:54.480
Together with Kellogg's Frosted Flakes, we're producing a made-for-the-Twitch community

42:54.480 --> 42:59.480
live experience that introduces a beloved character to well-known Twitch streamers, fosters

42:59.480 --> 43:04.680
a healthy dose of competition, and encourages viewers to interact with Tony the Tiger in

43:04.680 --> 43:07.080
real-time chat.

43:07.080 --> 43:11.920
He doesn't say this, but I'm going to assume it's just implied, inviting some various

43:11.920 --> 43:17.680
corners of the internet to come and get so horny that you will not believe it.

43:17.680 --> 43:21.160
The mod team must be extensive.

43:21.160 --> 43:26.600
How refreshing it will be for the internet to see a virtual Tony the Tiger where he does

43:26.600 --> 43:30.440
not have just the biggest hog just out.

43:30.440 --> 43:31.440
You assume.

43:31.440 --> 43:35.520
Well, yeah, I guess I've not looked at much erotic Tony the Tiger.

43:35.520 --> 43:36.520
No, I'm sorry.

43:36.520 --> 43:41.160
Why don't you assume that during this Frosted Flakes sponsored stream, Tony the Tiger wouldn't

43:41.160 --> 43:42.160
have his hog out.

43:42.160 --> 43:43.160
Oh, fair.

43:43.160 --> 43:44.160
Yeah.

43:44.160 --> 43:45.680
Now, well, it is virtual, right?

43:45.680 --> 43:53.520
So someone would have to go deep into the option, some deep hot bars on Blender to really

43:53.520 --> 43:54.760
whip up this Tiger hog.

43:54.760 --> 44:00.320
Now I also want to say, the reason I love this so much is to talk about the 2010s.

44:00.320 --> 44:05.360
For a long time there, Tony's whole deal was like, get out there and play some sports.

44:05.360 --> 44:07.280
Let's do soccer and basketball.

44:07.280 --> 44:08.280
You're great.

44:08.280 --> 44:09.880
We are the mighty, mighty Tigers.

44:09.880 --> 44:12.320
And now he's like, this chair is pretty comfortable.

44:12.320 --> 44:20.240
I'm just going to stay here and enjoy some Baja Blast for a while.

44:20.240 --> 44:27.400
At the behest of this MBM listener that sent this question in, I ducked into Tumblr just

44:27.400 --> 44:31.360
to see how it's going over there.

44:31.360 --> 44:36.160
There's a lot of like, it's my time to shine, yes, yes.

44:36.160 --> 44:39.200
We have to tell the furries, yes.

44:39.200 --> 44:43.760
Post entire pages of Tony X Grinch fanfic in the chat.

44:43.760 --> 44:44.760
Yes.

44:44.760 --> 44:45.760
Let's go.

44:45.760 --> 44:46.760
Yes.

44:46.760 --> 44:47.760
Yes.

44:47.760 --> 44:51.960
We need to bring that you can give me a yogurt enema anytime, Tony energy.

44:51.960 --> 44:52.960
Whoa.

44:52.960 --> 44:53.960
Yeah.

44:53.960 --> 44:56.320
You can Frost my Flake, Tony.

44:56.320 --> 44:57.320
Thank you.

44:57.320 --> 44:58.320
There's so much.

44:58.320 --> 45:04.080
Enema is like a Victorian era cure for wanting to masturbate, in case anyone's wondering.

45:04.080 --> 45:06.440
We just talked about it on Schmaners this week.

45:06.440 --> 45:08.000
Duh, everyone knows that.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
Do they?

45:09.000 --> 45:13.280
There's so much of the internet.

45:13.280 --> 45:15.080
And I like that.

45:15.080 --> 45:16.960
There's so much of it.

45:16.960 --> 45:18.000
Oh yeah.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.520
Anything you could want, it's always there.

45:22.520 --> 45:27.280
And I'm grateful for this, Tony.

45:27.280 --> 45:28.800
This is a question about the picture.

45:28.800 --> 45:30.640
Where the fuck are his ears?

45:30.640 --> 45:31.900
Tiger ears are big.

45:31.900 --> 45:34.200
Those headphones would not cover them.

45:34.200 --> 45:35.200
That's a good point.

45:35.200 --> 45:36.200
Thank you.

45:36.200 --> 45:37.200
You know what?

45:37.200 --> 45:38.200
I think I can, hold on.

45:38.200 --> 45:42.080
I think I can add a image, if y'all would like to see.

45:42.080 --> 45:43.400
Yes, please.

45:43.400 --> 45:46.720
Are you going to drop the, it's important for me to know which channel you're going

45:46.720 --> 45:47.720
to put this in.

45:47.720 --> 45:48.720
Yeah, live life, love people.

45:48.720 --> 45:52.200
I don't want it to be our public company chat, because that will raise-

45:52.200 --> 45:56.200
No, I'm going to put it into this, into this, into this.

45:56.200 --> 45:57.680
Oh boy.

45:57.680 --> 46:00.920
Yeah, there he is.

46:00.920 --> 46:05.360
When you said you were about to drop a pic, you told us that you were on the deep web,

46:05.360 --> 46:06.360
and that you found a Tony the Tiger picture.

46:06.360 --> 46:07.360
No, no, no.

46:07.360 --> 46:08.540
This is just a picture of the thing.

46:08.540 --> 46:11.680
I just want to say, man, it's a good setup, Tony.

46:11.680 --> 46:13.160
It's a good streamer setup.

46:13.160 --> 46:17.440
His PC is, I don't know if you guys noticed this, his PC is milk cooled.

46:17.440 --> 46:18.440
That's so cool.

46:18.440 --> 46:19.440
That's fucking funny.

46:19.440 --> 46:20.440
That's so cool.

46:20.440 --> 46:22.600
Now, I will say, not a great microphone, Tony.

46:22.600 --> 46:23.600
You could do better.

46:23.600 --> 46:24.600
Yeah, do better, Tony.

46:24.600 --> 46:25.600
You got a lot of money.

46:25.600 --> 46:26.600
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie.

46:26.600 --> 46:27.600
I wanted...

46:27.600 --> 46:33.460
I want a Munch squad.

46:33.460 --> 46:37.560
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, I want to Munch squad.

46:37.560 --> 46:38.680
Squad.

46:38.680 --> 46:41.460
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

46:41.460 --> 46:45.000
Welcome to Munch squad, it's a podcast within a podcast profiling the latest in brain eating.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.680
I know we've been doing it for a little while, but-

46:46.680 --> 46:48.280
This feels like Munch fraud.

46:48.280 --> 46:50.800
No, I didn't do the intro, so it was irritating me.

46:50.800 --> 46:53.840
I wanted to announce the video very quickly.

46:53.840 --> 46:58.840
Very quickly about this, KFC Thailand

46:58.840 --> 47:02.080
is introducing a modernist Mother's Day gift idea,

47:02.080 --> 47:03.960
the KFC Chicken Pop Garland,

47:03.960 --> 47:06.220
celebrating National Mother's Day with a twist.

47:06.220 --> 47:07.060
No.

47:07.060 --> 47:07.900
Cool.

47:07.900 --> 47:09.680
All right, y'all.

47:09.680 --> 47:11.840
Normally I would build to the picture of it,

47:11.840 --> 47:16.840
but I'm just gonna show you the picture, okay?

47:18.640 --> 47:19.880
Here we go.

47:19.880 --> 47:22.040
Okay, so this is the KFC Pop Garland, huh?

47:22.040 --> 47:23.320
I like this.

47:23.320 --> 47:25.440
Just for the record, I wanna go on record and say

47:25.440 --> 47:27.720
before I know anything else about it that I do like it.

47:27.720 --> 47:28.960
What is it?

47:28.960 --> 47:31.760
KFC Thailand is helping you celebrate like never before

47:31.760 --> 47:34.200
introducing our Mother's Day gift idea,

47:34.200 --> 47:36.040
KFC Chicken Pop Garland.

47:36.040 --> 47:38.000
The Colonel's crispy edible blooms

47:38.000 --> 47:40.320
were crafted in partnership with HeartMade,

47:40.320 --> 47:42.640
one of the most coveted floral studios.

47:42.640 --> 47:44.000
This unique creation combines

47:44.000 --> 47:45.920
the assortment of mom's beloved items,

47:45.920 --> 47:48.680
like her favorite menu, KFC Chicken Pop,

47:48.680 --> 47:51.760
flowers and veggies she cooks for the family.

47:51.760 --> 47:53.680
Everyone can create their own unique

47:53.680 --> 47:56.320
HeartMade Chicken Pop Garland for mom.

47:56.320 --> 47:57.160
Well, that's nice.

47:57.160 --> 47:59.920
First of all, the customization is nice.

47:59.920 --> 48:00.760
I appreciate it.

48:00.760 --> 48:03.800
I guess I don't know what a garland is.

48:04.680 --> 48:05.680
Yeah, it's fascinating.

48:05.680 --> 48:06.600
I think we're up against,

48:06.600 --> 48:09.080
I mean, I know what a garland is here

48:09.080 --> 48:10.920
and how we would use that,

48:10.920 --> 48:12.360
but I think we're up against,

48:12.360 --> 48:16.600
it's interesting to see the sort of like cultural,

48:17.640 --> 48:20.600
like I wanna say ruining,

48:20.600 --> 48:22.760
like ruining cultures that I don't even,

48:22.760 --> 48:24.920
I haven't even gotten a chance to understand

48:24.920 --> 48:28.600
what this actually is before KFC has gotten to it

48:28.600 --> 48:29.960
and kind of ruined it.

48:29.960 --> 48:33.600
Because to me, this picture looks like a tiny wreath

48:33.600 --> 48:35.440
or maybe something I would put on a doorknob.

48:35.440 --> 48:37.200
Looks like a tiny wreath of chicken,

48:37.200 --> 48:38.760
of popcorn chicken.

48:38.760 --> 48:40.720
I mean, a garland can be a wreath.

48:40.720 --> 48:43.760
Now, can I also tell you guys what's fucking with me?

48:43.760 --> 48:44.600
Yeah.

48:44.600 --> 48:48.880
How is it held together that I can still eat it, right?

48:48.880 --> 48:52.040
Barbed wire, weirdly, sharing the aromatic,

48:52.040 --> 48:55.480
crispy, juicy fried chicken ensures quality family time

48:55.480 --> 48:59.000
and the scrumptious bites just speak louder than words.

48:59.000 --> 49:02.480
Is it like a candy necklace kind of thing?

49:02.480 --> 49:04.120
That is what it seems.

49:04.120 --> 49:06.280
You'll get to reminisce about the school days

49:06.280 --> 49:08.360
when you get to craft your own gift for mom.

49:08.360 --> 49:11.680
Most importantly, do not drool over the garland.

49:11.680 --> 49:15.320
Just hashtag save chicken pop for mom.

49:15.320 --> 49:16.960
Let her enjoy the moment

49:16.960 --> 49:18.520
with the scrumptious heart made treat.

49:18.520 --> 49:19.720
You know what I love about that?

49:19.720 --> 49:21.120
That's a hashtag that applies

49:21.120 --> 49:22.680
to so many different situations.

49:22.680 --> 49:25.680
That's gonna catch on outside of this, you know what I mean?

49:25.680 --> 49:28.520
That's gonna be the new hashtag blessed.

49:28.520 --> 49:29.560
I'm looking at this

49:29.560 --> 49:32.640
and I do want a ring-shaped fried chicken experience.

49:32.640 --> 49:35.200
It seems like it would be easy to take on the go.

49:35.200 --> 49:36.840
Yeah, you could have one in each hand

49:36.840 --> 49:39.600
like you're fucking in Tron or something.

49:39.600 --> 49:40.440
I like that.

49:40.440 --> 49:41.280
Like a bracelet.

49:41.280 --> 49:42.120
Yeah, man.

49:42.120 --> 49:43.200
Yeah, we're several like a bracelet.

49:43.200 --> 49:46.280
The garland tutorial and giveaway activity

49:46.280 --> 49:48.720
are on Facebook and TikTok live.

49:48.720 --> 49:49.560
Wait.

49:49.560 --> 49:54.560
No, by Up Poompat Lam Samang.

49:55.160 --> 49:58.520
A famous Thai young actor is the one doing it.

49:58.520 --> 50:02.640
Now, if you look, I wanna show you a picture of this cat

50:02.640 --> 50:07.240
and tell me if you think that the crafts

50:07.240 --> 50:09.640
that this person is able to do,

50:09.640 --> 50:11.200
you would be able to replicate it anyway.

50:11.200 --> 50:12.040
No.

50:12.040 --> 50:13.040
Like they look so much more capable than me.

50:13.040 --> 50:13.880
No, absolutely not.

50:13.880 --> 50:15.560
Absolutely beautiful.

50:15.560 --> 50:17.640
I would never be able to keep up with that person.

50:17.640 --> 50:19.520
They'd be like, nugget, nugget, nugget, nugget.

50:19.520 --> 50:20.920
Like, wait, slow down, please.

50:20.920 --> 50:24.040
It also occurs to me, is this a full DIY?

50:24.040 --> 50:25.000
So this isn't like-

50:25.000 --> 50:25.840
Yes.

50:25.840 --> 50:27.960
I think you are getting the components for this.

50:27.960 --> 50:29.440
It's not clear in the thing,

50:29.440 --> 50:31.480
but I think you're getting the components for this,

50:31.480 --> 50:33.160
which is the popcorn chicken.

50:33.160 --> 50:35.960
Well, I think all you're getting is the popcorn chicken.

50:35.960 --> 50:36.800
Right.

50:36.800 --> 50:37.640
I think they're just selling,

50:37.640 --> 50:39.800
what they're saying is, here's chicken.

50:39.800 --> 50:41.160
Here's some chicken.

50:41.160 --> 50:43.000
Do what thou wilt.

50:43.000 --> 50:43.840
Because here's the thing,

50:43.840 --> 50:45.840
they can't sell you a chicken bracelet.

50:45.840 --> 50:46.680
No.

50:46.680 --> 50:47.520
Like legally, they can't sell you a chicken bracelet.

50:47.520 --> 50:48.360
No, they can't.

50:48.360 --> 50:49.200
Because you're going to chomp into that

50:49.200 --> 50:53.240
and get the wire or twine or thread or whatever.

50:53.240 --> 50:54.760
Best case scenario.

50:54.760 --> 50:56.360
That's best case scenario

50:56.360 --> 50:58.360
that is holding that ring together.

50:58.360 --> 51:02.560
And that's just a lawsuit waiting to happen.

51:02.560 --> 51:03.720
It's not even waiting.

51:03.720 --> 51:06.240
That's just going to be a lawsuit pretty much day one.

51:06.240 --> 51:07.800
There will be a class action sort of.

51:07.800 --> 51:08.680
Yeah, I ate the thread.

51:08.680 --> 51:09.520
I ate the thread.

51:09.520 --> 51:10.460
I ate the wire.

51:10.460 --> 51:11.300
I did eat it.

51:11.300 --> 51:12.140
Sorry.

51:12.140 --> 51:12.980
I thought it was food.

51:12.980 --> 51:14.520
You can't sell it if it's not part of the thing.

51:14.520 --> 51:17.280
KFC, our relationship, historically,

51:17.280 --> 51:18.440
is that I give them money

51:18.440 --> 51:19.920
and they give me food in exchange.

51:19.920 --> 51:21.800
And I eat all of it.

51:21.800 --> 51:23.520
I eat everything they give me.

51:23.520 --> 51:24.720
I know about the bucket.

51:24.720 --> 51:26.320
Like I'm not an idiot.

51:26.320 --> 51:28.600
And I've always been up in the air about bones, frankly,

51:28.600 --> 51:30.040
because dogs eat them, right?

51:30.040 --> 51:30.880
So I don't know,

51:30.880 --> 51:32.580
but I don't think dogs are supposed to eat them, right?

51:32.580 --> 51:34.080
So isn't that, whoa.

51:34.080 --> 51:36.560
It's, I am easily tricked.

51:37.640 --> 51:38.480
Another quick question?

51:38.480 --> 51:39.320
Yeah, let's do it.

51:39.320 --> 51:43.520
Y'all, I have, y'all,

51:44.400 --> 51:47.860
my tabs right now are a blasted land.

51:47.860 --> 51:49.920
It is, it is, it is.

51:49.920 --> 51:52.320
I'm trying so desperately to find something

51:52.320 --> 51:53.760
that I recognize.

51:53.760 --> 51:56.680
It's just Tony the Tiger and chicken bracelets

51:56.680 --> 51:58.240
all the way down.

51:58.240 --> 52:00.320
Read that last question there, Jamie.

52:00.320 --> 52:01.400
Okay.

52:01.400 --> 52:04.880
I ride a very distinct e-bike for transportation and fun.

52:04.880 --> 52:06.020
I love my e-bike.

52:06.020 --> 52:08.320
However, there's a skate park on my usual route.

52:08.320 --> 52:10.240
There's often a group of teenagers that yell at me,

52:10.240 --> 52:11.500
just full on scream.

52:14.840 --> 52:17.400
One of these teenagers is my girlfriend's younger brother.

52:17.400 --> 52:18.820
He definitely knows me.

52:21.240 --> 52:23.480
I haven't told my girlfriend yet,

52:23.480 --> 52:24.320
but should I,

52:29.920 --> 52:31.480
should I tattle on him?

52:31.480 --> 52:35.040
How can I get them to stop screaming at me?

52:35.040 --> 52:39.080
That's from bothered by brother-in-law.

52:39.080 --> 52:43.120
The image of somebody just riding past a park on a bike

52:43.120 --> 52:48.120
and then just like six to 10, like teenagers just like,

52:49.160 --> 52:50.520
turning in unison,

52:50.520 --> 52:52.720
like something from American Horror Story.

52:52.720 --> 52:53.760
Just all of them,

52:55.760 --> 52:57.920
evasion of the body snatchers, just like,

52:59.920 --> 53:03.200
I think your little brother got body snatched for sure.

53:03.200 --> 53:04.040
For sure, for sure.

53:04.040 --> 53:05.640
I'm a pod person now.

53:06.760 --> 53:09.160
If the decision is let them keep screaming at me

53:09.160 --> 53:10.520
or tattle on the brother,

53:10.520 --> 53:11.720
there's a third option,

53:11.720 --> 53:13.120
which is get in that skate park

53:13.120 --> 53:15.400
and do some sick tricks on your e-bike.

53:17.880 --> 53:22.200
Those dum-dums are using probably skateboards

53:22.200 --> 53:27.200
and maybe bikes that do not have that electric power

53:28.520 --> 53:29.680
coursing through them,

53:29.680 --> 53:31.440
allowing you to do stunts,

53:31.440 --> 53:34.200
the likes of which these children could not imagine.

53:35.600 --> 53:36.800
You'll go down a half pipe and be like,

53:36.800 --> 53:37.880
he's going really slow.

53:37.880 --> 53:41.160
And then you kick on the electricity, I guess.

53:41.160 --> 53:45.080
You scream by the power of Zeus and you launch off the top.

53:45.080 --> 53:48.440
Up there and do like a 900,

53:48.440 --> 53:51.840
just like Nikolai Tesla did when he invented the e-bike.

53:53.040 --> 53:55.400
And you'll shut those kids up.

53:55.400 --> 53:57.640
Maybe they're screaming because of how awesome

53:57.640 --> 54:01.000
your electricity powered bicycle is.

54:01.000 --> 54:01.840
Did you think about that?

54:01.840 --> 54:02.680
This is what I'm saying.

54:02.680 --> 54:03.960
If they're doing this consistently,

54:03.960 --> 54:06.240
I don't think it's to fuck with you, right?

54:06.240 --> 54:07.200
They'd vary that up.

54:07.200 --> 54:09.040
If they didn't get a response the first couple of times,

54:09.040 --> 54:10.080
they'd vary it up.

54:10.080 --> 54:14.280
I think this is very much like, there he is, our hero.

54:14.280 --> 54:17.080
Our hero, the e-biker.

54:17.080 --> 54:18.440
Get in there, man.

54:18.440 --> 54:20.120
Show those kids that you can do.

54:20.120 --> 54:21.440
Now don't fuck this up.

54:21.440 --> 54:22.640
I can't stress it enough.

54:22.640 --> 54:25.480
If you do get in there and you eat it in front of them,

54:25.480 --> 54:28.280
that's going to be the rest of your life.

54:28.280 --> 54:29.920
Or maybe that's their game plan,

54:29.920 --> 54:34.360
is they shout at every non-skater who hoes by

54:34.360 --> 54:36.920
thinking that they will be threatened into coming in,

54:36.920 --> 54:39.120
and then they fall on their butt,

54:39.120 --> 54:40.480
and then the children get a good laugh.

54:40.480 --> 54:41.960
But then they're done with you.

54:41.960 --> 54:45.160
We're agreed that if this person tattles

54:45.160 --> 54:47.400
to their girlfriend on the little brother,

54:47.400 --> 54:49.280
that will be the end of their relationship

54:49.280 --> 54:50.120
as they know it, right?

54:50.120 --> 54:52.400
With the little brother or with the girlfriend or both?

54:52.400 --> 54:54.200
With the girlfriend, you can't.

54:54.200 --> 54:57.120
Like, think about the words.

54:57.120 --> 54:58.920
You gotta think about the words.

54:58.920 --> 55:00.720
Your brother has been bullying me

55:00.720 --> 55:03.520
while I tried to ride past him on my fast bike,

55:03.520 --> 55:05.560
and I slowed down long enough for him to bully me,

55:05.560 --> 55:06.400
and then I leave.

55:06.400 --> 55:07.240
What do you mean?

55:07.240 --> 55:08.120
Well, they scream at me.

55:08.120 --> 55:08.960
What do they scream?

55:08.960 --> 55:10.000
It's just noise.

55:10.000 --> 55:10.840
Okay.

55:10.840 --> 55:12.640
Some bike guy, or like, there's the bike, or Mr. Bike.

55:12.640 --> 55:14.440
So what do you want me to do about this?

55:14.440 --> 55:17.320
Tell your little brother not to bully me.

55:17.320 --> 55:18.240
Please don't.

55:19.760 --> 55:20.600
Do you need to think about,

55:20.600 --> 55:22.200
when you get in there and you land a sick trick,

55:22.200 --> 55:24.600
what is going to be your motivational statement

55:24.600 --> 55:26.960
when you land it and you come screeching up to them

55:26.960 --> 55:28.600
and gonna cure a slide or something,

55:28.600 --> 55:30.960
and then you pop up and you need to say like,

55:30.960 --> 55:32.600
don't say don't do drugs,

55:32.600 --> 55:34.640
because there are some drugs that are kind of cool.

55:34.640 --> 55:36.680
Like, you want to pop up and be like,

55:36.680 --> 55:38.320
don't fall for Ponzi schemes,

55:38.320 --> 55:41.320
or whatever your thing is gonna be that these kids are like,

55:41.320 --> 55:42.840
whoa, that was amazing.

55:42.840 --> 55:45.040
And then you're like, you know, don't forget.

55:45.040 --> 55:46.120
You tear a phone book in half.

55:46.120 --> 55:47.080
Yeah, you tear a phone,

55:47.080 --> 55:48.480
you pop up for me to cure a slide,

55:48.480 --> 55:49.680
you tear the phone book in half,

55:49.680 --> 55:53.120
and you say, make sure to invest wisely, right?

55:53.120 --> 55:55.800
Here's, do you have a Roth IRA, right?

55:55.800 --> 55:56.640
And then you pedal out of it.

55:56.640 --> 55:58.520
I can set that up for you kids right now.

55:58.520 --> 55:59.360
Right now.

55:59.360 --> 56:00.400
Who's got money?

56:00.400 --> 56:01.360
Which one of you kids have money?

56:01.360 --> 56:03.240
I don't know when the last time you all screamed was.

56:03.240 --> 56:04.320
It sucks.

56:04.320 --> 56:05.160
It hurts.

56:05.160 --> 56:05.980
What, screaming?

56:05.980 --> 56:07.320
Yeah, it sucks to scream.

56:07.320 --> 56:08.880
Well, you have to find,

56:08.880 --> 56:11.640
you have to find your natural pitch,

56:11.640 --> 56:12.480
and you have to do it with ease.

56:12.480 --> 56:13.640
Okay, but I'm talking about,

56:13.640 --> 56:15.320
if they scream at you the whole time

56:15.320 --> 56:16.440
that you're biking by them,

56:16.440 --> 56:18.800
next time, just stop and look at them.

56:18.800 --> 56:20.960
And then they will scream and scream and scream

56:20.960 --> 56:23.480
until I guess they stop because they get too tired.

56:23.480 --> 56:24.680
And then you just bike away.

56:24.680 --> 56:25.520
Nah, dude.

56:25.520 --> 56:26.480
And they'll probably not want to do it again,

56:26.480 --> 56:28.840
cause they're like, there's that guy, it's your loser

56:28.840 --> 56:32.280
brother-in-law, who we all hate so much

56:32.280 --> 56:34.760
because of how, how electric his bike is.

56:34.760 --> 56:35.580
Yeah.

56:36.580 --> 56:38.840
But I can't keep screaming at this dude.

56:38.840 --> 56:41.360
Cause I have choir practice at church tomorrow.

56:41.360 --> 56:44.600
I, like, okay, Griffin, counterpoint.

56:44.600 --> 56:45.960
I don't want escalation from screaming.

56:45.960 --> 56:47.040
There's no counterpoint.

56:47.040 --> 56:48.700
I don't want escalation from screaming.

56:48.700 --> 56:50.320
If screaming is the worst thing they're doing

56:50.320 --> 56:51.440
and it's just noise,

56:51.440 --> 56:52.680
and that's the worst thing they're doing.

56:52.680 --> 56:53.520
Oh, okay.

56:53.520 --> 56:55.580
They're going to say, I'm tired of screaming at this dude.

56:55.580 --> 56:56.640
He did stop.

56:56.640 --> 56:57.760
Let's go hurt him.

56:57.760 --> 56:58.800
Let's take his bike.

56:58.800 --> 57:01.120
Let's use this bike to charge our vapes.

57:01.120 --> 57:02.960
We'll take, we'll rip the battery from his bike,

57:02.960 --> 57:05.040
charge our vapes with it, blow our vape in his face.

57:05.040 --> 57:08.120
Plug it into our iPads so we can play more Roblox

57:08.120 --> 57:08.960
while we vape.

57:08.960 --> 57:10.960
Roblox to each other.

57:12.160 --> 57:13.400
And then you're just going to,

57:13.400 --> 57:14.820
and can I tell you the saddest part?

57:14.820 --> 57:16.580
Then you're just going to have a bike.

57:16.580 --> 57:18.960
And you may as well just push that down

57:18.960 --> 57:20.480
the nearest storm drain.

57:20.480 --> 57:22.560
Give it right to Pennywise.

57:22.560 --> 57:24.400
Give it right to Pennywise, he'll have fun with it.

57:24.400 --> 57:26.760
You kids have a bike?

57:26.760 --> 57:28.680
Oh, I thought this was electric.

57:28.680 --> 57:30.280
This sucks ass.

57:30.280 --> 57:31.720
How fucking dope.

57:31.720 --> 57:35.040
Georgie, do you have a razor scooter?

57:35.040 --> 57:37.840
It takes so long for me to get around down here.

57:37.840 --> 57:42.840
How fucking sick would a remake of It set now be

57:44.400 --> 57:47.880
when like a kid is walking in the rain

57:47.880 --> 57:49.680
and Penny's like, hello little child.

57:49.680 --> 57:50.920
And he's like, are you?

57:50.920 --> 57:53.320
What the fuck is your deal?

57:53.320 --> 57:56.320
Like I've got Fortnite skin certificate.

57:56.320 --> 57:59.600
You can cash these in to get Bo Effect.

57:59.600 --> 58:02.120
No, he would not be that up to trends.

58:02.120 --> 58:04.680
He would be like, do you want a little boat?

58:04.680 --> 58:07.040
And he'd be like, I'm playing Subway Surfers.

58:07.040 --> 58:08.520
And you made me lose Pennywise.

58:08.520 --> 58:10.440
I'm going to come to, hey friends,

58:10.440 --> 58:11.600
what do you have in your hand?

58:11.600 --> 58:12.480
It's a cell phone.

58:12.480 --> 58:13.320
Shut up.

58:13.320 --> 58:14.140
I'm not talking to you.

58:14.140 --> 58:14.980
Friends, come out and beat this clown's ass.

58:14.980 --> 58:15.960
I've got balloons down here.

58:15.960 --> 58:17.520
Fuck, balloons?

58:17.520 --> 58:18.760
I'm 12, dude.

58:18.760 --> 58:20.080
What the fuck are you talking about?

58:20.080 --> 58:22.760
In the original It, it took,

58:22.760 --> 58:27.040
it took four kids to beat that clown's ass.

58:27.040 --> 58:31.520
And they were like 1970s, 80s kids.

58:31.520 --> 58:34.080
And they, they had a slingshot.

58:34.080 --> 58:36.200
I'm saying that like a kid could get,

58:36.200 --> 58:38.640
all these kids could get pepper spray

58:38.640 --> 58:41.620
at a nearby gas station and fuck this dude.

58:41.620 --> 58:43.840
That movie would be four minutes long.

58:43.840 --> 58:48.840
They hire someone on TaskRabbit to come murder him.

58:48.840 --> 58:52.960
To come murder his ass and rip him apart.

58:52.960 --> 58:55.280
Anyway, that's the.

58:55.280 --> 58:56.680
That's the story with Pennywise.

58:56.680 --> 58:58.480
That's how we're going to get Pennywise,

58:58.480 --> 59:00.040
in case y'all are wondering.

59:00.040 --> 59:00.880
That's how we're going to get him.

59:00.880 --> 59:03.320
Henry saw a video, a YouTube popped up

59:03.320 --> 59:07.120
on Henry's cursed feed and Pennywise was in it.

59:07.120 --> 59:08.400
And he's like, oh man, shit.

59:08.400 --> 59:10.000
I'm afraid of this clown now.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.280
And I didn't know how to tell him like,

59:12.280 --> 59:16.120
you could, you and your preschool friends

59:16.120 --> 59:18.440
could massacre this clown.

59:18.440 --> 59:20.080
It would not even be close.

59:20.080 --> 59:21.240
He would open his mouth real wide

59:21.240 --> 59:22.600
and do his like silly dance.

59:22.600 --> 59:24.320
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

59:24.320 --> 59:27.200
And then you would just like throw a tide pod in his mouth.

59:27.200 --> 59:30.280
And he would just fall over and die.

59:30.280 --> 59:33.040
I've seen some pretty cursed roadblocks, obviously.

59:33.040 --> 59:34.720
This isn't doing shit to me, dude.

59:34.720 --> 59:35.560
This is nothing.

59:35.560 --> 59:38.240
Yeah, I saw a thing where I was in a butcher's mouth

59:38.240 --> 59:39.080
for a while.

59:39.080 --> 59:41.240
I don't care about any of this, man.

59:43.440 --> 59:46.240
Thank you so much for joining us on our program.

59:46.240 --> 59:48.220

59:48.220 --> 59:49.440

59:49.440 --> 59:50.860
Maybe you've learned a little something.

59:50.860 --> 59:53.120
Maybe you've learned a little something about that, man.

59:53.120 --> 59:54.680
You know, I don't know, maybe.

59:54.680 --> 59:55.940
Probably not.

59:55.940 --> 59:57.080
Probably not, but maybe.

59:57.080 --> 59:58.360
Who knows?

59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.240
Who knows, maybe.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:02.980
Thank you so much for being a part of our show.

01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:04.360

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:05.200
Hell yeah, dude.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:09.160

So we have no idea.

01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:32.240
Maybe they're already sold out.

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:33.080
Bummer.

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:33.900
Sorry about that.

Sorry.

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:38.060

I'm on Twitch, twitch.tv slash the Travis McElroy.

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:46.120
I'm hoping to partner with Tony the Tiger soon.

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:49.640
Do a couple Five Nights at Freddy's runs

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:50.600
with Tony the Tiger.

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:51.880
So if you can go subscribe,

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.160
that will help boost my numbers

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:56.280
so I can go and convince Tony the Tiger

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:58.360
to play Five Nights at Freddy's with me.

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:01.280
Thanks to Montaigne for these for our theme song,

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:03.440
My Life Is Better With You.

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.880
She has a new album coming out September 2nd

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.400
called Making It.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:10.200
That is, it looks really dope.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.720
It's got some good songs on it.

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:14.600
And it was just her birthday, so go get it.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:15.440
Go get it.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.280
Go get that album.

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:19.760
There's the, I pre-ordered the album and shirt

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:20.760
last night for it.

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:24.640
It is like the wildest, the wildest design ever.

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:25.480
I can't wait.

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:26.640
September 2nd is when that one drops.

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:29.920
And thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:34.640
So then what do we do now is the end of it.

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.680
Cause we need to really.

01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:39.440
We've really been struggling.

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:44.160
What if this time, okay, maybe we like harmonize

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:47.240
on like closing time by the semi-sonics.

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:48.560
It can't be.

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.760
Can we just, and here's something I've been thinking about.

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:52.520
We've said some really funny shit.

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:53.560
Yeah.

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:55.520
We've said some really funny shit so far.

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.680
And I think like, I think people are gonna listen

01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:59.400
to this episode and they're gonna like it.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:02.660
Do we need to have, does it feel like a little,

01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:04.400
like hubris a little bit to be like,

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:07.100
we can generate one more funny shit.

01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:09.400
Like the rest of the show, we don't sit in silence

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:12.520
staring at each other, waiting for the funny thing

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:15.840
to just like leap out of us spontaneously.

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.740
You're saying that it should just be like,

01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:21.420
maybe we should pivot to, this is too hard.

01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:25.680
And if we have a bit at the end,

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:28.100
that means we left something in the tank.

01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:29.360
We left something in the tank.

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:32.880
And so two options, I guess then is the first

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:36.080
is we just like dripping sweat.

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:37.920
Just like, that's it folks.

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.860
We tap out, we can't do any more, bye.

01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:44.860
Or if we say something like super funny during the show,

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:47.960
we stop the show right there.

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.300
And that's the end.

01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:51.400
Just go out on a high.

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:53.120
Yeah, and I don't wanna do that

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:54.600
because they have to be a certain length

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.320
or the advertisers get even angrier at us

01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:00.200
than they are as like a baseline level.

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.040
If you listen to the ads this week,

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.520
it would be hard for you to imagine, but it's true.

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:04.360
It's true.

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.240
Maybe we should end with like just an inspirational quote.

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:09.680
It's not funny.

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:11.640
It's just like an uplifting,

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.520
something to think about as we head out.

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:16.280
So Griffin, why don't you give us an inspirational quote?

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:17.200
Sure, tear it up.

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:18.560
Get out there and tear it up.

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:21.520
Find something beautiful and destroy it.

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:22.360
This is great.

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:23.180
I love this.

01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:24.020
This is good.

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:26.140
Then why didn't you end the fucking show, Justin?

01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:27.280
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.120
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:31.180
Tear down the bourgeoisie.

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:32.160
I don't know what that word means.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:33.760
This has been my brother and me.

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.760
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:37.120
Is bourgeoisie good or bad?

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:42.120
I don't know.
