00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:50.320
Hello everybody. As you can tell from the jingle bell noises, the Griffin has edited

00:50.320 --> 00:55.920
into the show. It's jingle jingle jingle jingle jingle jingle jingle jingle jingle.

00:55.920 --> 00:58.400
That's the word jingle said over and over again.

00:58.400 --> 01:02.800
It's onomatopoetic. Candle Nights has possibly begun,

01:02.800 --> 01:06.160
or maybe it hasn't. My name is Justin McElroy, and I'm your oldest brother.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.320
I'm Travis McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother.

01:08.320 --> 01:11.600
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy, and Justin, you bring up a great point.

01:11.600 --> 01:19.520
We are in the phase of Candle Nights where the holiday is part of sort of a quantum state

01:20.080 --> 01:23.440
where you're not really sure if it's crack-a-lack. Griffin, that's exactly what I was thinking.

01:23.440 --> 01:28.960
Yeah, like if you're observing it, it exists, but right now I don't see it anywhere.

01:28.960 --> 01:32.160
I don't see it in my heart or the hearts of my fellow men and women.

01:32.880 --> 01:35.280
This is the thing about Candle Nights that is so important.

01:35.280 --> 01:39.840
A lot of people ask us, when does it start? I don't know.

01:39.840 --> 01:44.000
That's the thing. The magical thing is it starts at different times for literally

01:44.000 --> 01:45.840
every single human being.

01:45.840 --> 01:48.240
Someday you're just gonna be walking down the street and you'll see

01:48.240 --> 01:54.080
like two people very much in love or smelling some roasted nuts in the air.

01:54.080 --> 01:54.480
Yeah.

01:54.480 --> 01:57.200
And you'll think, it has begun. This is the season.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.320
Last summer I saw Guardians of the Galaxy in theater and I was like,

02:00.320 --> 02:05.920
oh shit, early Candle Nights for me. And I had to celebrate it for like six months.

02:05.920 --> 02:06.400
It was exhausting.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.200
I'm pretty sure Candle Nights is a serious medical condition.

02:09.200 --> 02:12.800
If you or someone you love has Candle Nights for more than four months,

02:12.800 --> 02:14.320
you should consult a doctor.

02:14.320 --> 02:18.160
I did. I did. Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, they just, they were all-

02:18.160 --> 02:19.440
They were up in the mix.

02:19.440 --> 02:23.360
They instilled it inside of me. They birthed the seed from my-

02:23.360 --> 02:24.640
What about Rocket Cooper?

02:25.760 --> 02:26.960
Yes, him too.

02:26.960 --> 02:31.840
The problem with a lot of holidays is like, is it too early to start doing X?

02:31.840 --> 02:34.400
But with Candle Nights, that doesn't exist because it's,

02:34.400 --> 02:36.000
whatever you feel in your heart is a-

02:36.800 --> 02:39.440
Justin, you shouldn't do X to see at holidays.

02:39.440 --> 02:39.680
Yes.

02:40.480 --> 02:41.040
What?

02:41.040 --> 02:41.760
Yes, you should.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.600
You should do X to see at holidays.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.720
Right. That's true. I should roll Molly every school.

02:46.720 --> 02:50.720
They've made it a sweet honeypot of sensory experiences

02:50.720 --> 02:54.320
with all those twinkly lights and jingly bells and sweet savory treats.

02:54.320 --> 02:59.600
There's a, it is a pansexual, panreligious,

02:59.600 --> 03:01.920
or is it panreligious, pansexual? That's the order.

03:01.920 --> 03:02.880
Whatever, whatever it is.

03:02.880 --> 03:05.360
It's a panreligious, pansexual, personal pan holiday,

03:05.360 --> 03:07.760
and there are no rules. It is just right.

03:07.760 --> 03:09.360
That's the other thing about Candle Nights.

03:09.360 --> 03:11.040
You start celebrating whenever you want.

03:11.040 --> 03:12.800
Is Santa in it? You know he is.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.720
Does it got some menorahs? It does indeed.

03:14.720 --> 03:14.880
Yep.

03:14.880 --> 03:17.920
Does it got that Chevy wine?

03:17.920 --> 03:20.240
Last night I went to a Hanukkah party

03:20.240 --> 03:23.680
and I got chorned on that Chevy wine, damn.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.600
Here's the thing, here's the great thing about Candle Nights

03:29.600 --> 03:32.560
is that it is also Hanukkah and Christmas.

03:32.560 --> 03:37.200
It absorbs all other holidays into itself.

03:37.200 --> 03:43.040
And winter solstice and Kwanzaa and there's probably others.

03:43.040 --> 03:45.440
Speaking of Candle Nights giving, by the way,

03:46.400 --> 03:49.200
we did this thing last year called NBNBM Angels

03:49.760 --> 03:53.920
where people helped out some less fortunate families

03:53.920 --> 03:56.160
in the Huntington, West Virginia area

03:56.160 --> 03:57.680
where we are all hailing from.

03:58.640 --> 04:00.480
I am gonna, I've got the list

04:01.120 --> 04:03.120
and I'm gonna be spooling that back up today

04:03.120 --> 04:04.560
if you wanna get into it. Hell yeah.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.400
Last year, do you guys remember what we did last?

04:06.400 --> 04:09.280
We said like thank, yeah, if you helped out,

04:09.280 --> 04:11.040
we recorded thank yous to you.

04:11.040 --> 04:13.920
And I think we do that again, like let's just do it.

04:13.920 --> 04:14.400
Yeah, yeah.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.000
Commit to it right now on the show.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.760
So if you go to our Facebook group,

04:19.120 --> 04:20.800
we'll hammer out the details there

04:20.800 --> 04:22.080
and tell you all the particulars,

04:22.080 --> 04:25.680
but we're gonna save an entire town,

04:25.680 --> 04:27.360
save Christmas for an entire city

04:27.360 --> 04:29.680
and who else could say that besides the Grinch?

04:30.720 --> 04:32.000
I think Ernest.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.040
Ernest does, okay, I have a question

04:35.040 --> 04:35.840
because I'm not gonna watch it.

04:35.840 --> 04:38.320
Is Ernest Save Christmas the one where he gets the superpowers?

04:38.320 --> 04:40.640
Well, okay.

04:40.640 --> 04:42.160
No, that's Ernest goes to jail and gets.

04:42.160 --> 04:44.320
Well, that's where he gets the electric powers.

04:44.320 --> 04:48.320
I think in Ernest gets stupid, he gets powers.

04:48.320 --> 04:48.960
God.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.320
I think he gets powers in a lot.

04:50.320 --> 04:53.040
Ernest goes to camp and then he cries by a window.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.400
Is he like rogue?

04:54.400 --> 04:56.480
Does he just, does he get new superpowers

04:56.480 --> 04:58.160
every installment of his?

04:59.040 --> 05:00.720
Guys, I watched a holiday movie the other day

05:00.720 --> 05:03.680
called Mixed Nuts starring Steve Martin.

05:03.680 --> 05:06.000
Oh boy, that's a little bit of a dark one for.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.040
Yeah, I was told it was gonna put me in the holiday spirit

05:09.040 --> 05:11.120
and it gave me negative holiday spirit points.

05:11.760 --> 05:12.560
Why is that?

05:12.560 --> 05:13.840
It detracted from my sum total.

05:13.840 --> 05:15.440
I don't know, I think it has something to do with the fact

05:15.440 --> 05:17.200
that it's all about a suicide hotline

05:17.200 --> 05:18.240
and then at one point in the movie,

05:18.240 --> 05:20.160
they just merc Gary Shandling.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.440
They just killed Gary Shandling.

05:21.440 --> 05:22.960
They no scope Gary Shandling.

05:22.960 --> 05:26.400
They do, they no scope 360, no scope Gary Shandling

05:26.400 --> 05:28.080
and then like two people have sex

05:28.080 --> 05:30.400
like literally two and a half minutes after

05:30.400 --> 05:34.240
they no scope Gary Shandling and it's like cool movie.

05:34.240 --> 05:36.560
Come here Santa Claus, I'm ready for you now.

05:36.560 --> 05:38.240
And they camped Shandling's respawn.

05:38.800 --> 05:41.120
So that's, oh God, it just gets gross.

05:41.120 --> 05:42.800
They troll the respawn Shandling.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.480
Let's do some questions.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.760
Yeah, let's help some people.

05:47.760 --> 05:50.240
I think we're, I'm ready to get on it.

05:50.240 --> 05:51.440
All right, here's our first question.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.480
As my dad gets closer and closer to retirement,

05:54.480 --> 05:56.160
it's become obvious to his children

05:56.160 --> 05:57.680
that he doesn't have any hobbies.

05:58.240 --> 06:01.760
What's more is my mom seems to get a bit annoyed with him

06:01.760 --> 06:04.080
when he works from home and has free time.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.160
Can you guys think of any good hobby ideas

06:06.160 --> 06:09.760
for a spreadsheet loving math nerd like my dad?

06:09.760 --> 06:11.200
My dad is dull in Durham.

06:12.560 --> 06:13.600
Oh, that's the inner name.

06:13.600 --> 06:16.960
They're not just like stating their dad's dull.

06:16.960 --> 06:17.840
My dad's dull.

06:19.200 --> 06:21.440
Additional information if needed, I should say so.

06:22.320 --> 06:26.080
He is an actuarial consultant.

06:26.080 --> 06:27.360
Don't know what it is, can't say it.

06:27.360 --> 06:29.120
He's an actual consultant.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.920
He played the trumpet in high school.

06:31.920 --> 06:35.840
He's cheap and I don't think he has the patience

06:35.840 --> 06:37.520
to build model ships.

06:37.520 --> 06:40.400
I like the last one because it's like,

06:40.960 --> 06:42.480
I know what you guys are about to say.

06:43.280 --> 06:44.800
Let me cut you off before you say it.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.280
Before you say model ships, model ships is out.

06:47.280 --> 06:48.240
That's right out.

06:48.240 --> 06:52.560
Okay, what if he loves spreadsheets, right?

06:52.560 --> 06:55.280
Statistics, what if he starts statistically

06:55.280 --> 06:59.360
like quantifying really like unimportant things?

06:59.360 --> 07:01.760
If he was like, if you look at my bar graph,

07:01.760 --> 07:04.160
this is how many times that bird landed

07:04.160 --> 07:06.000
on our air conditioner.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.120
So you want him to go insane.

07:09.120 --> 07:12.880
You wanna make this person's dad become an insane dad.

07:14.240 --> 07:15.360
Check out my insane dad.

07:16.240 --> 07:19.120
Maybe he could use statistics and numbers

07:19.120 --> 07:22.000
to find out what the most pleasurable hobby for him would be

07:22.000 --> 07:22.960
and that's his hobby.

07:22.960 --> 07:23.440
I like that a lot.

07:23.440 --> 07:24.000
And then he dies.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.400
It's canoes.

07:27.680 --> 07:30.640
No, I spent too long cracking the canoe code.

07:30.640 --> 07:33.760
He starts by paint my numbers and he sees like,

07:33.760 --> 07:35.680
well, that would be less satisfying,

07:35.680 --> 07:37.520
but it would be good time spent,

07:37.520 --> 07:38.720
but there's a lot of cleanup.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.320
So I'm wasting minutes there.

07:40.320 --> 07:41.840
That's not the most efficient way

07:41.840 --> 07:43.520
for me to spend my retirement.

07:43.520 --> 07:46.080
So then maybe he'll put a four next to that

07:46.080 --> 07:47.360
on the spreadsheet.

07:47.360 --> 07:48.240
Wait, out of what?

07:49.120 --> 07:49.760
A thousand.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.080
He hates paying my numbers.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.680
Yeah, one of the worst hobbies you can have.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.760
Can you just make a hobby out of maybe

07:57.760 --> 08:00.800
just following this spreadsheet thread,

08:01.680 --> 08:03.520
just put every number into a spreadsheet

08:04.640 --> 08:05.840
and just every day,

08:05.840 --> 08:08.720
like maybe you put in like a bunch more numbers.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.000
Good work today.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.280
I did four through 10.

08:11.840 --> 08:12.320
Yeah.

08:12.320 --> 08:14.240
Well, hopefully you could do more numbers.

08:14.240 --> 08:15.920
He doesn't say he's good at it.

08:15.920 --> 08:16.640
Okay.

08:16.640 --> 08:17.280
It's a good point.

08:17.280 --> 08:18.400
He would get better eventually,

08:18.400 --> 08:20.080
but yeah, Trav, I guess starting now.

08:20.080 --> 08:24.000
Could he use statistics and his actuarial knowledge

08:24.000 --> 08:25.840
to be an elderly crime solver?

08:25.840 --> 08:28.000
Or like murder she wrote,

08:28.000 --> 08:30.080
but it'll be like murder she mathed.

08:30.080 --> 08:31.280
I don't think there's anything there.

08:31.840 --> 08:32.400
No, I don't.

08:32.400 --> 08:35.120
You know, when you take crime statistics

08:35.920 --> 08:38.320
and then you find like a murderer.

08:38.320 --> 08:39.680
Yeah, I don't know how to use Excel,

08:39.680 --> 08:43.280
but I'm pretty sure you can't just put like gun

08:43.280 --> 08:45.200
and then under that blood splatter

08:45.200 --> 08:46.400
and then under that.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.520
Sulfur X.

08:47.520 --> 08:48.160
Sulfur.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.640
Well, under that, just like Mark and his wife

08:50.640 --> 08:51.920
were having trouble.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.440
And then you highlight all of that

08:53.440 --> 08:55.360
and you click resolve

08:55.360 --> 08:57.920
and it's like definitely Mark is the killer.

08:57.920 --> 08:58.720
I didn't watch it,

08:58.720 --> 09:01.760
but isn't this what the show numbers was actually about?

09:01.760 --> 09:03.920
Like, isn't this what the plot of numbers

09:03.920 --> 09:05.280
that you're describing, Travis?

09:05.920 --> 09:07.120
Except in my show,

09:07.120 --> 09:09.600
it's shot from the perspective of Judd Hirsch.

09:09.600 --> 09:12.240
For my show, it's shot from the perspective of the numbers.

09:12.240 --> 09:13.440
Seven, eight, nine.

09:13.440 --> 09:14.400
What are they thinking?

09:16.320 --> 09:17.120
13.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.720
Well, that's a rough burden to bear.

09:18.720 --> 09:20.160
What does he do in his off time

09:20.160 --> 09:21.440
when he's not being a number

09:21.440 --> 09:26.320
and representing a concrete amount of things?

09:26.320 --> 09:27.920
The trumpet in high school, I think,

09:28.720 --> 09:30.160
unless he got so good at trumpet

09:30.160 --> 09:30.800
that he was like,

09:30.800 --> 09:32.000
well, I've mastered this.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.480
Gotta put this down.

09:34.480 --> 09:35.920
No need to continue playing trumpet.

09:35.920 --> 09:37.520
Kind of how like Louis Armstrong was like,

09:38.400 --> 09:39.520
I beat trumpets.

09:39.520 --> 09:40.560
I finished it.

09:40.560 --> 09:42.320
Anybody have anything else for me to play?

09:42.320 --> 09:44.720
Maybe you wanna get him in like,

09:44.720 --> 09:46.560
okay, you've got your model trains, right?

09:46.560 --> 09:47.760
You've got your whittling.

09:47.760 --> 09:49.360
Maybe you wanna get him into something

09:49.360 --> 09:54.080
that's so like non sequitur old man hobby.

09:54.080 --> 09:56.640
Like what if he gets really into like being a house DJ?

09:57.680 --> 09:58.320
Fuck yeah.

09:58.320 --> 10:00.080
This is my dad.

10:00.080 --> 10:01.520
We're going wakeboarding later.

10:01.520 --> 10:03.440
Yeah, something where it's just like,

10:03.440 --> 10:06.560
oh yeah, listen, we don't want you to be sedentary.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.240
We want something that'll get you out there.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.000
Now you're like an extreme mountain biker.

10:11.120 --> 10:12.880
We're taking you to the burn, dad.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.680
Hey dad, we're going to the burn.

10:15.680 --> 10:19.280
Did you see my dad's Red Bull stunt reel?

10:20.880 --> 10:22.400
It's blowing up on YouTube.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.720
Did you hear my dad got to deal with bird house?

10:24.720 --> 10:25.840
My dad's amazing.

10:26.640 --> 10:28.160
He's a skate king.

10:29.600 --> 10:30.880
He's king of skate.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.160
He's king of skate.

10:32.160 --> 10:35.280
This is how cool my dad is that he has things.

10:35.280 --> 10:38.080
He has names and titles and I don't even know about him.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.120
He's too elite for me.

10:39.920 --> 10:41.280
This is my elite dad.

10:41.280 --> 10:42.800
I need to go to the video game store.

10:42.800 --> 10:47.600
I'm going to buy Mark's Dad Pro Skater 5.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.920
I got cheat codes for Mark's Dad Pro Skater 5.

10:49.920 --> 10:51.280
I can do a 900, easy.

10:51.840 --> 10:55.120
When they put the Spider Dad into Mark's Dad Pro Skater 5,

10:55.120 --> 10:56.720
I was like, it's a little much.

10:56.720 --> 11:01.520
But when they had Dad Maul in there, that was better.

11:01.520 --> 11:02.720
Do you guys want a Yahoo answer?

11:02.720 --> 11:06.800
Do you remember when Dad Margera was the star

11:06.800 --> 11:10.240
of Mark's Dad Pro Skater Underground?

11:10.240 --> 11:13.440
Of the hit TV show, Jack Dad.

11:13.440 --> 11:13.940
Dadass.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.120
Hey guys, welcome to Dadass.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.640
This Yahoo was sent in by Level 9000 Yajuru Drew

11:20.640 --> 11:21.440
in Drew Davenport.

11:21.440 --> 11:21.920
Thank you, Drew.

11:21.920 --> 11:24.320
It's by Yajuru Answers user Cassidy.

11:24.960 --> 11:30.720
Cassidy asks, what's the difference between toke and blaze?

11:32.960 --> 11:33.360
Good one.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.720
You're in the right place, Cassidy.

11:35.360 --> 11:38.480
I told someone I'd like to toke with them sometime.

11:38.480 --> 11:38.980
Mm-hmm.

11:40.160 --> 11:41.280
Which is crazy.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.200
Which is a crazy thing to say.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.960
Which is a narc thing to say.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.800
It's a total narc thing to say.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.800
I told someone I'd like to toke with them sometime.

11:50.800 --> 11:54.080
And they said, they don't toke, they blaze.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.840
Hello, fellow young people.

11:57.840 --> 11:59.600
Are we all toking today?

12:00.640 --> 12:02.640
And I never knew there was a difference.

12:02.640 --> 12:04.400
So can someone explain it to me?

12:04.400 --> 12:09.360
This is definitely two cops trying to bust each other, right?

12:09.360 --> 12:10.560
Wait, are you a cop?

12:10.560 --> 12:10.960
Yeah.

12:10.960 --> 12:11.600
Are you?

12:11.600 --> 12:12.080
Yes.

12:12.080 --> 12:12.880
Damn it.

12:12.880 --> 12:13.120
Damn it.

12:13.120 --> 12:13.760
Not again.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.920
Fell for each other's web.

12:16.480 --> 12:18.560
We have to get on the same page with this.

12:18.560 --> 12:23.120
Okay, to try to answer the question in a concrete way.

12:23.120 --> 12:29.680
To me, I feel like toke is the act of one inhalation of marijuana.

12:29.680 --> 12:34.880
And I believe that blaze would just be the entire experience

12:34.880 --> 12:36.160
of smoking marijuana.

12:36.160 --> 12:36.720
Everything from like-

12:36.720 --> 12:38.480
It's like squares and rectangles.

12:38.480 --> 12:39.360
You know what I mean?

12:39.360 --> 12:41.600
Yeah, like toking is part of blazing,

12:41.600 --> 12:44.640
but like blazing includes buying posters.

12:44.640 --> 12:47.760
And like having them at the place where you're going is life.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.200
Yeah, it's like blaze life.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.800
Every blaze is a toke.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.080
But not every toke is a blaze.

12:52.080 --> 12:53.200
Some tokes are rips.

12:55.280 --> 12:55.520
Yes.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.320
And some are chunky cheevers.

12:58.320 --> 13:01.920
That is true, Travis. Some are chunky cheevers of that sweet green leaf.

13:01.920 --> 13:02.960
Didn't even think about that.

13:03.520 --> 13:04.880
It's a complicated little Venn diagram.

13:04.880 --> 13:09.920
I feel like you can toke alone, but you can only blaze in a group.

13:11.840 --> 13:15.040
That's actually a really good indicator, I think,

13:15.040 --> 13:18.640
for an important marijuana distinction.

13:19.200 --> 13:21.840
There are some slang terms for smoking marijuana

13:21.840 --> 13:25.680
that are going to sound ridiculous if you say them by yourself.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.040
If you say like, hey, what are you doing?

13:27.040 --> 13:29.920
I'm just getting blazed by yourself.

13:29.920 --> 13:31.120
Bummer, summer.

13:31.120 --> 13:32.960
Wow, that's a really big bummer.

13:32.960 --> 13:33.920
You're getting blazed.

13:33.920 --> 13:36.000
But I feel like you can chill by yourself.

13:36.000 --> 13:36.880
Yeah, just chilling.

13:37.600 --> 13:38.480
Netflix and pot.

13:39.040 --> 13:40.400
Is that what the kids do?

13:40.400 --> 13:42.080
I Netflix and chilled myself.

13:43.520 --> 13:45.280
I can't believe I fell for it.

13:45.280 --> 13:49.280
I just don't get why it would be so important to you

13:49.280 --> 13:52.240
to draw the distinction to another living, breathing human being.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.240
Hey, don't say, no, I don't.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.080
How dare you?

13:56.080 --> 13:58.560
Toke, I blaze.

13:58.560 --> 14:00.880
It seems weird to me that you would be the kind of person

14:00.880 --> 14:03.040
that only blazed and did not toke.

14:03.040 --> 14:05.600
But is toke, does toke some way like,

14:05.600 --> 14:09.040
connote that you like don't commit to the blaze life?

14:09.040 --> 14:10.800
That you're like, oh, you're just a toker.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.280
You just dip your toke in the water.

14:13.280 --> 14:15.200
You don't even, you're not going for it.

14:15.200 --> 14:18.080
To me, the difference is, and in my mind's eye,

14:18.080 --> 14:20.880
the difference is you toke, you're smoking marijuana.

14:20.880 --> 14:23.440
You blaze, you smoke marijuana, and then as soon as you're done,

14:23.440 --> 14:26.080
like throw your arms way open wide

14:26.080 --> 14:27.920
and just embrace the entire experience

14:27.920 --> 14:29.840
and just announce that you're blazed.

14:29.840 --> 14:31.280
That seems to be the difference.

14:31.280 --> 14:33.680
I guess you guys are just making me rethink my whole thing

14:33.680 --> 14:37.120
because I thought I was living a 420 blaze life,

14:37.120 --> 14:41.120
but I just, it feels like maybe that's all a lie.

14:41.120 --> 14:43.200
This has been a reverse intervention.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.960
You're not doing enough drugs, Kerbin.

14:45.920 --> 14:47.760
Do you think that maybe you misheard them

14:47.760 --> 14:50.480
and they say, I don't toke, I laze?

14:50.480 --> 14:51.840
And they were talking about eating chips.

14:51.840 --> 14:55.040
They just eat, they just enjoy lazed potato chips

14:56.160 --> 14:58.800
whenever their urge to smoke weed gets to them.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.680
Or were you talking to an old American gladiator

15:01.680 --> 15:03.920
who's saying, no, I'm not toke, I'm blaze.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.360
That's possible.

15:07.360 --> 15:08.800
I could have sworn you were a turbo.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.160
No, actually, I'm blaze.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.600
I'm blaze, but I get that a lot.

15:12.880 --> 15:15.920
We usually travel together just to make it easier on people.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.920
What if there were American gladiators,

15:17.920 --> 15:19.600
like they ended in a new season.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.680
It launched on April 20th

15:21.680 --> 15:24.880
and all of the gladiators were weed slang.

15:24.880 --> 15:27.120
They all were like, I'm pot cloud.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.640
That's not weed slang.

15:30.640 --> 15:31.760
What are you talking about?

15:31.760 --> 15:33.200
I was just saying words.

15:34.800 --> 15:38.720
You guys want to breathe in this pot cloud with me tonight?

15:40.480 --> 15:42.080
430, what?

15:44.400 --> 15:45.280
That's just a time.

15:45.280 --> 15:48.960
That's what time we were going to do it though.

15:51.600 --> 15:54.240
It's one of the, 420 is one of the great ironies of pot

15:54.240 --> 15:56.720
because it requires that people smoke weed

15:56.720 --> 15:58.240
and also be punctual.

15:58.240 --> 15:59.360
That doesn't seem fair.

15:59.360 --> 16:00.960
Why do you have to also worry about that?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.320
I was also about to say that it's a problem

16:02.320 --> 16:04.080
if you have like a nine to five job,

16:04.080 --> 16:05.600
but it's probably not.

16:05.600 --> 16:06.800
It's probably not an issue.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.080
An ish, no.

16:08.080 --> 16:10.240
I have to leave right now, but it's not five o'clock.

16:10.240 --> 16:11.120
It's only 410.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.120
I know, please let me go.

16:13.120 --> 16:15.280
I'm going to miss it.

16:18.400 --> 16:19.760
There's an answer here that says toke

16:19.760 --> 16:20.960
is just a couple of small hits,

16:20.960 --> 16:22.720
but blazing is smoking a lot.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.880
See, I mean, I feel like we got it.

16:25.760 --> 16:27.200
What if you start toking,

16:27.200 --> 16:29.200
but then you get interrupted by something else

16:29.200 --> 16:32.000
and you can't fulfill the blaze requirement.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.480
Or what if you start intending to only toke

16:34.480 --> 16:36.320
and suddenly realize you've blazed.

16:36.960 --> 16:37.520
Oh no.

16:38.240 --> 16:39.600
Yeah, that's a better bill.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.280
I've got a bris to go to.

16:41.280 --> 16:42.640
I didn't mean to blaze.

16:42.640 --> 16:44.080
I accidentally got blazed.

16:44.080 --> 16:46.160
Oh no, I can't come to work today, boss.

16:46.720 --> 16:47.680
It happened again.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.760
Hey, that's understandable.

16:49.760 --> 16:52.880
That's a perfectly valid wanting to toke,

16:52.880 --> 16:54.640
but accidentally getting blazed.

16:54.640 --> 16:57.120
I don't think this will affect Blockbuster's business at all.

16:57.760 --> 16:58.800
I think it'll be fine.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.200
Take it from me, the CEO of Blockbuster.

17:03.200 --> 17:04.800
Jimmy Blockbuster.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.400
I'm a cool laid back CEO.

17:07.760 --> 17:08.880
Everything's going great.

17:08.880 --> 17:10.320
People will always need videos.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.240
VHS is the future.

17:12.960 --> 17:14.720
I hope no one's stealing our posters.

17:15.520 --> 17:17.680
What do you need, Blade 2?

17:17.680 --> 17:19.120
Quit joking around, we got it.

17:20.320 --> 17:21.920
We should order 18 copies,

17:21.920 --> 17:25.120
just in case people want to get multiple copies of Blade 2.

17:25.120 --> 17:27.760
Hey, do you know how you could go to the grocery store

17:27.760 --> 17:30.480
and get a box of popcorn for three cents?

17:30.480 --> 17:32.640
How about we sell you a fake tub of it for $8?

17:33.520 --> 17:35.200
Just like a movie theater.

17:35.200 --> 17:36.080
Please don't steal.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.480
Here's a very large box of Twizzlers.

17:38.480 --> 17:42.080
Isn't that the metric by which you always wanted to enjoy Twizzlers?

17:42.080 --> 17:42.880
Buy the box.

17:44.960 --> 17:46.240
Because that's what we've got for you.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.800
Enjoy these waxy strings forever.

17:50.080 --> 17:52.960
Enjoy these terrible waxy candy strings forever.

17:52.960 --> 17:54.720
It's a punishment you buy for yourself.

17:55.360 --> 17:56.160
Buy the box.

17:57.280 --> 17:58.240
Apparently.

17:58.240 --> 18:01.520
Hey, do you love that snowcaps flavor at the movie theater?

18:01.520 --> 18:06.000
But I always wonder why nobody sells those candies anywhere else.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.520
Well, good news, Blockbuster.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.760
Enjoy these and showgirls, whatever.

18:09.760 --> 18:10.640
Yeah, whatever.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.560
No judgment here, judgment-free zone.

18:13.520 --> 18:18.080
I'm glad God punished Blockbuster for their hubris.

18:19.520 --> 18:20.560
They just got too big.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.280
I got another question here.

18:23.280 --> 18:24.640
What is the best way to tell someone

18:24.640 --> 18:27.360
they're driving the wrong way on a one-way street?

18:27.360 --> 18:28.160
Oh, man.

18:28.160 --> 18:31.280
This has happened to me three times in the last two months.

18:31.280 --> 18:32.880
I tried, what if it's him?

18:32.880 --> 18:34.720
How do I tell everybody that they're driving

18:34.720 --> 18:37.440
the wrong way on this one-way street I found?

18:37.440 --> 18:39.360
I tried honking loudly, flashing my lights,

18:39.360 --> 18:40.720
and gesturing forcefully.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.360
But the first two times, they just drove on

18:43.360 --> 18:44.960
by going the wrong way.

18:44.960 --> 18:46.560
And one guy actually flipped me off.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.800
I'm not sure what else to do outside crossing into their lane

18:48.800 --> 18:50.560
and forcing them to swerve off the road.

18:50.560 --> 18:52.080
I'm pretty sure this is a bad idea.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.600
That's Kevin from Kansas.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.560
Yeah, Kevmo.

18:54.560 --> 18:57.680
I bet that guy who flipped him off felt real stupid

18:57.680 --> 18:59.360
like five seconds later.

18:59.360 --> 19:04.160
He was like, fuck you.

19:04.160 --> 19:04.720
Oh, God.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.880
Oh, I was wrong.

19:07.600 --> 19:08.240
Oh, no.

19:09.120 --> 19:09.840
It's my bad.

19:10.560 --> 19:15.760
I want to strongly, strongly caution you against this idea

19:15.760 --> 19:17.280
of trying to run people off the road.

19:18.080 --> 19:20.080
I don't understand why, when there's a little bit

19:20.080 --> 19:23.840
of a traffic confusion, it has to turn into Mad Max right away.

19:25.520 --> 19:27.760
Here in Los Angeles, traffic laws mean nothing.

19:27.760 --> 19:30.960
I mean nothing to people.

19:30.960 --> 19:34.240
And you would be amazed, Justin, at how often that kind of...

19:34.240 --> 19:38.320
I've seen people waiting, they get stuck in traffic

19:38.320 --> 19:40.800
because we're all trying to merge under one tiny ass road

19:40.800 --> 19:42.160
to get over a mountain.

19:42.160 --> 19:45.760
And people will drive up onto a sidewalk because they're like,

19:45.760 --> 19:47.600
but I want to go now.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.280
And they'll just go up on a sidewalk

19:49.280 --> 19:50.480
and then get back in line.

19:51.840 --> 19:52.880
They just want to.

19:52.880 --> 19:53.840
They want to then.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.640
No, officer, you don't understand.

19:56.640 --> 19:58.480
I want you now.

19:58.480 --> 19:59.840
I need you now, sir.

19:59.840 --> 20:00.880
Please, I want to.

20:00.880 --> 20:02.480
Why wouldn't you let me do this?

20:02.480 --> 20:04.480
Can't you see that I want it?

20:05.840 --> 20:07.200
I want to be there.

20:07.200 --> 20:08.400
Why don't you get this?

20:08.400 --> 20:10.240
I would like to be there now, please.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.200
And I'm back here.

20:11.200 --> 20:14.320
And can't you see how angry that is making me?

20:14.320 --> 20:17.280
I need to turn left out of the right-hand lane.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.440
I don't think there's a good way of telling people.

20:19.440 --> 20:21.520
I mean, once...

20:21.520 --> 20:22.880
Okay, here's the problem.

20:22.880 --> 20:27.040
So once they're out of the range at which you could tell them,

20:27.040 --> 20:28.000
like once you realize like,

20:28.000 --> 20:29.600
oh, that person's doing this bad thing.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.120
I got to do something to warn them.

20:31.120 --> 20:32.400
By the time you've had that realization,

20:32.400 --> 20:34.720
they're already in your rear view.

20:34.720 --> 20:37.200
I mean, there's somebody else's problem now.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.360
You've just got to go on with your day

20:39.360 --> 20:42.160
because you don't have time to worry about that anymore.

20:42.160 --> 20:43.440
You've got other things to worry about.

20:43.440 --> 20:44.800
You've got a demanding job.

20:44.800 --> 20:47.040
You've got kids that have to go to school.

20:47.040 --> 20:48.560
Like you're busy right now.

20:48.560 --> 20:49.600
You don't have time.

20:49.600 --> 20:52.800
Let me roll this idea up into a little sticky ball

20:52.800 --> 20:55.440
and throw it at the two of you and see what happens.

20:56.880 --> 21:00.800
Can we get CV radios in every car?

21:02.240 --> 21:05.760
I have wanted this technology forever.

21:06.400 --> 21:07.680
I've always wanted this.

21:09.280 --> 21:10.480
So that's an easy fix, right?

21:10.480 --> 21:13.840
Like, hey compadre, you're breaking the rules.

21:14.880 --> 21:18.400
Let me turn up the dial, Griffin, with this.

21:18.400 --> 21:19.680
Please, please, please.

21:19.680 --> 21:22.320
You take the concept of like emojis, right?

21:22.320 --> 21:24.320
And you have like pre-programmed,

21:24.320 --> 21:27.200
like you're going the wrong way or you're an asshole

21:27.200 --> 21:28.880
or like that's not a turn lane.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.560
Just buttons that you push

21:30.560 --> 21:34.560
and it just like beams a robotic like voice into their CV

21:34.560 --> 21:35.520
because you're driving.

21:35.520 --> 21:38.080
We don't want to institute like more distraction.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.200
So you just press a button

21:39.200 --> 21:42.320
and like maybe it's an LED display on their dash

21:42.320 --> 21:43.120
or it's a voice.

21:43.120 --> 21:44.800
It's like you're going the wrong way.

21:44.800 --> 21:47.760
You're saying to limit distraction instead of saying,

21:47.760 --> 21:49.440
hey buddy, you're driving the wrong way.

21:49.440 --> 21:52.240
You want to look down into a virtual keyboard

21:52.240 --> 21:55.120
and swipe through until you find the correct emoji

21:55.120 --> 21:58.320
and then tap in maybe a few emojis to send their way.

21:58.320 --> 21:59.840
And then it appears on their screen.

21:59.840 --> 22:00.960
Of course, they have to close.

22:00.960 --> 22:03.600
They have to like activate the notification

22:03.600 --> 22:05.280
in order to view your emojis.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.600
Well, maybe we make it more ergonomic than that, Griffin.

22:07.600 --> 22:10.400
We put the buttons around the steering wheel,

22:11.040 --> 22:12.480
like on the back of the steering wheel.

22:12.480 --> 22:14.160
So you're hitting it with your fingertips

22:14.160 --> 22:16.720
and it becomes just secondary nature.

22:16.720 --> 22:18.240
I hate to quibble,

22:18.240 --> 22:21.440
but if we're creating technology to make cars safer

22:21.440 --> 22:24.240
and we're trying to figure out a scientific technological way

22:24.240 --> 22:25.520
to communicate to a driver

22:25.520 --> 22:28.000
that he's going the wrong way on a wrong way street,

22:28.000 --> 22:30.800
perhaps the most efficient, elegant solution to that

22:30.800 --> 22:32.880
is not have other drivers notice

22:32.880 --> 22:35.200
and then try to text them the information.

22:35.200 --> 22:37.520
Perhaps their car could tell them

22:37.520 --> 22:39.200
that they were doing this terrible thing.

22:39.200 --> 22:41.280
Yes, and I think this conversation

22:41.280 --> 22:44.000
is probably how we ended up with the car horn

22:44.000 --> 22:47.040
because logically, if we keep going down this road

22:47.040 --> 22:48.720
for like another couple of hours,

22:48.720 --> 22:50.320
the three of us are just gonna agree like,

22:50.320 --> 22:53.200
what if you just have one big button on your car

22:53.200 --> 22:54.240
that just went, hey?

22:55.520 --> 22:57.200
And then that can be sort of a catch all

22:57.200 --> 22:58.960
for you're doing something wrong.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.600
What if a turtle in a cloud flew over

23:01.600 --> 23:03.760
and fishing line down and picked you up

23:03.760 --> 23:05.440
and turns you back around?

23:05.440 --> 23:06.480
Yeah, all right.

23:06.480 --> 23:08.160
The problem with the car horn though

23:08.160 --> 23:10.000
is that it doesn't, through years,

23:10.000 --> 23:14.080
any word used repeatedly is gonna become,

23:14.080 --> 23:18.640
like I'll use, you know, stupid for a while, right?

23:18.640 --> 23:23.640
Like stupid meant bad and then in an Orwellian style,

23:24.160 --> 23:25.760
stupid eventually meant good

23:25.760 --> 23:27.600
and I think it's probably means bad again.

23:28.320 --> 23:30.880
But the important thing is that any word used long enough

23:30.880 --> 23:34.000
will start to lose its meaning and change and evolve.

23:34.880 --> 23:37.440
The car horn initially did mean like,

23:37.440 --> 23:39.680
hey, let's drive a little safer please

23:39.680 --> 23:41.200
or hey, please pay attention.

23:41.200 --> 23:44.160
But now, through years of misuse,

23:44.160 --> 23:47.440
it's like people only honk ironically.

23:47.440 --> 23:49.040
Yeah, it can mean anything.

23:49.040 --> 23:49.600
It can mean anything.

23:49.600 --> 23:54.880
It could be like, hey, my team is the best at sports today.

23:55.920 --> 23:56.960
They won sports.

23:56.960 --> 24:00.400
Or it could just be like a proclamation of like,

24:00.400 --> 24:01.840
I'm here, I'm here.

24:01.840 --> 24:02.960
I am here.

24:02.960 --> 24:04.320
Or what's this button do?

24:04.320 --> 24:05.920
Oh man, it makes a lot of noise.

24:05.920 --> 24:08.000
Well, that's why you gotta couple it with something,

24:08.000 --> 24:09.200
make it a word and a blow.

24:09.200 --> 24:09.760
You know what I mean?

24:09.760 --> 24:12.080
So we do the horns and then you have like,

24:12.080 --> 24:13.200
almost like semaphore.

24:13.200 --> 24:14.560
You have different hand signals.

24:14.560 --> 24:15.520
I see what you're saying.

24:15.520 --> 24:17.600
So you're saying like three quick horns means,

24:17.600 --> 24:18.640
Jeremy, I'm outside.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.680
Also, I wanna jump in.

24:21.680 --> 24:24.240
It's 2015, everyone owns a phone

24:24.240 --> 24:26.800
and has it within six inches of them at all time.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.800
Please stop honking your horns to pick people up

24:28.800 --> 24:30.160
at six o'clock in the morning.

24:30.160 --> 24:31.200
What are you doing?

24:31.200 --> 24:32.400
It's 2015.

24:32.400 --> 24:34.320
Don't honk the horn, you asshole.

24:34.320 --> 24:36.000
As long as we're putting people on blast,

24:36.960 --> 24:38.320
this one goes out to our dad.

24:38.320 --> 24:39.120
Speaking of phones.

24:39.120 --> 24:40.400
Hey dad.

24:40.400 --> 24:44.400
Hey dad, when you decide you get a wild hair

24:44.400 --> 24:46.960
and you wanna text Travis at 5.30 in the morning,

24:46.960 --> 24:49.280
his time, 8.30 in the morning, your time,

24:49.280 --> 24:50.880
7.30 in the morning, Griffin's time,

24:50.880 --> 24:53.360
an acceptable excuse to that is not,

24:53.360 --> 24:55.280
I didn't think you'd have your phone near you.

24:55.280 --> 24:56.400
Where else would it be?

24:56.400 --> 24:57.920
It's 2015.

24:57.920 --> 24:58.960
I talked about that afterwards.

24:58.960 --> 25:00.160
I die without it.

25:00.160 --> 25:01.840
I die if I don't know where it is

25:01.840 --> 25:04.560
and it's not touching me at all times, I die, dad.

25:04.560 --> 25:06.960
Time for bed, gotta carry my phone downstairs

25:06.960 --> 25:08.320
to the living room.

25:08.320 --> 25:09.280
Where else would it be?

25:10.000 --> 25:11.200
What if someone needs me?

25:11.760 --> 25:13.600
Yes, they don't.

25:13.600 --> 25:16.160
But let me hit you guys with another idea I just had.

25:16.160 --> 25:17.200
And this one's the real winner.

25:17.200 --> 25:19.120
You're not gonna even put dad on blast for a second.

25:19.120 --> 25:20.640
This one, well, he's, you know.

25:20.640 --> 25:22.720
I roll out the mat and you guys just walk by.

25:22.720 --> 25:23.520
I blasted him.

25:23.520 --> 25:24.160
I blasted him.

25:24.160 --> 25:25.360
I flavor blasted him.

25:25.360 --> 25:26.480
He's of a different generation.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.080
I'm always happy to hear from our father.

25:28.080 --> 25:31.520
Listen, let me hit you guys with this

25:31.520 --> 25:35.280
because I'm all about increasing goodwill in the world.

25:35.280 --> 25:38.800
You got the one horn now and that one horn,

25:39.680 --> 25:42.320
yes, Justin, as you said, could mean anything.

25:42.320 --> 25:44.400
But most of the time it means hey, dipshit.

25:45.040 --> 25:51.440
I would like to suggest that all cars come with three horns

25:51.440 --> 25:54.000
and it can be like three different sections

25:54.000 --> 25:55.280
in the middle of the steering wheel.

25:55.280 --> 25:56.480
And that'll probably be good too

25:56.480 --> 25:57.840
because if the airbag has to pop out,

25:57.840 --> 26:00.160
it gives it like a little natural sort of like space

26:00.160 --> 26:01.200
for it to blast out from.

26:01.200 --> 26:01.920
It's perforated.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.240
It's perforated, yes, Travis.

26:04.240 --> 26:06.880
So you still have the hey, dipshit button, right?

26:07.680 --> 26:11.840
But then we could have a more neutral horn

26:11.840 --> 26:13.440
or a special occasion horn.

26:14.880 --> 26:17.440
And then if you hear that one go off,

26:17.440 --> 26:19.760
it just means like, oh, that person's doing their own thing.

26:19.760 --> 26:22.640
They're celebrating the winning of a sports team

26:22.640 --> 26:23.440
or something like that.

26:23.440 --> 26:25.360
It's not traffic related.

26:26.080 --> 26:28.560
Non-traffic related, this is just a sound horn.

26:28.560 --> 26:30.160
But then you get that third horn.

26:30.160 --> 26:31.440
They just want to make noise.

26:31.440 --> 26:33.200
They just want to make noise.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.040
I get that because sometimes you're in traffic

26:35.040 --> 26:37.040
and you realize that like nobody can move.

26:37.040 --> 26:38.640
It's not like somebody's just sitting there,

26:38.640 --> 26:39.920
but you want to like express something.

26:39.920 --> 26:41.920
You want to be a part of the conversation, right?

26:41.920 --> 26:43.440
So maybe when you drive by and it's like,

26:44.080 --> 26:47.920
hit this up if you're voting for gore

26:47.920 --> 26:49.840
and then you sound just your sound horn

26:49.840 --> 26:51.520
because if you honk your danger horn,

26:51.520 --> 26:52.960
then people are gonna think you're in danger.

26:52.960 --> 26:56.800
Third horn though, third horn is the great job horn.

26:57.680 --> 27:02.160
And you do this if somebody does like a dope brake

27:02.160 --> 27:04.480
and like stops from hitting the car in front of them,

27:04.480 --> 27:05.760
which like slammed on their brakes

27:05.760 --> 27:07.760
and you'd be like, oh man, that was a close one.

27:07.760 --> 27:08.240
Great job.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.400
And you just hit them up with that

27:10.400 --> 27:11.760
and they say, oh, thank you.

27:11.760 --> 27:14.720
Or somebody does a dope ass parallel park

27:14.720 --> 27:16.160
in like a tight, tight spot.

27:16.160 --> 27:17.360
Like, oh, great job.

27:17.360 --> 27:19.520
Or they pull out of a spot

27:19.520 --> 27:21.840
and then they block the car that like rolled up

27:21.840 --> 27:23.920
to try to steal the spot that you were clearly waiting on.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.120
They block that car.

27:25.120 --> 27:26.800
When somebody does that, great job.

27:26.800 --> 27:29.600
If I see somebody do a very quick turn

27:29.600 --> 27:32.080
on the protected left instead of just like sitting there

27:32.080 --> 27:35.680
watching fucking minions in their built-in DVD player,

27:35.680 --> 27:36.640
great job.

27:36.640 --> 27:41.520
I would like to request one tiny horn at the bottom

27:41.520 --> 27:43.280
that's the equivalent of a throat clear

27:43.920 --> 27:45.520
because that's the horn I always need

27:45.520 --> 27:46.800
where it's like, oh, the light's green

27:46.800 --> 27:48.000
and this person hasn't moved yet.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.360
Just a, ahem.

27:49.360 --> 27:50.800
No, that's the pay attention horn.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.240
What were you saying, Justin?

27:52.240 --> 27:53.920
I would like that horn,

27:54.960 --> 27:57.440
the great job horn would be really useful

27:57.440 --> 27:59.200
for that moment when you're driving

27:59.200 --> 28:02.080
and you see someone who is driving the exact same

28:03.120 --> 28:05.760
make, model, and color in your vehicle

28:05.760 --> 28:09.520
and it suddenly becomes the most important thing

28:09.520 --> 28:12.960
in the world that that person and you have a moment.

28:13.520 --> 28:15.200
Is this just, does this just happen to me

28:15.200 --> 28:17.440
where it's like, if I see somebody else driving my car,

28:17.440 --> 28:19.120
they have to notice this is happening.

28:19.120 --> 28:20.080
Doesn't even need to be auto,

28:20.080 --> 28:21.760
it doesn't have to be car to car.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.920
It can be you see a fucking dope ass

28:23.920 --> 28:25.280
Little Caesar sign dancer.

28:25.280 --> 28:28.080
Great dance, great dance.

28:28.080 --> 28:31.680
Oh, this is great too for when you're on those long car trips

28:31.680 --> 28:33.920
and like you and the same red car

28:33.920 --> 28:36.960
have been on the highway just trading places

28:36.960 --> 28:38.480
for the last four hours.

28:38.480 --> 28:39.600
Hell yeah, I love that.

28:39.600 --> 28:41.440
We know we're doing this dance.

28:41.440 --> 28:43.120
We know we in this together.

28:43.120 --> 28:45.520
It's a horn for when you finally have to part ways.

28:45.520 --> 28:46.640
It's like, well, Kimisabi,

28:46.640 --> 28:48.240
I'll see you on down the Otzum Highway.

28:48.880 --> 28:49.360
Great job.

28:49.920 --> 28:50.880
Great job, my friend.

28:51.680 --> 28:53.360
I spent a hell of a time riding with you.

28:55.520 --> 28:56.960
Till we can dance again.

28:56.960 --> 28:58.240
Great job.

28:58.240 --> 29:00.400
Let me just onomatopoe this shit

29:00.400 --> 29:01.760
because we're going to have the danger horn,

29:01.760 --> 29:03.600
which is still like, right?

29:03.600 --> 29:06.240
But then the sound horn sounds like a dorky guy

29:06.240 --> 29:08.000
who just got really scared by something.

29:08.000 --> 29:08.480
Yeah.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.880
And then the sound horn can be like a whoop.

29:11.520 --> 29:13.920
And then the great job horn would just be like, great job.

29:16.800 --> 29:17.280
Great job.

29:17.920 --> 29:18.640
I like it.

29:18.640 --> 29:19.760
I like it's on the nose.

29:19.760 --> 29:21.920
I could never be confused with any of the other horns

29:21.920 --> 29:24.000
because you don't want to honk the great job horn

29:24.000 --> 29:25.360
and have someone be like, what?

29:25.360 --> 29:25.920
Oh, sorry.

29:25.920 --> 29:26.880
That was a great job.

29:26.880 --> 29:27.120
Right?

29:27.120 --> 29:31.360
Like, you don't even want that millisecond of like animosity.

29:31.360 --> 29:32.640
You want them to know right away.

29:32.640 --> 29:33.440
They're like, great job.

29:34.480 --> 29:37.760
I bought a Volkswagen Golf, a new Volkswagen Golf this year,

29:37.760 --> 29:41.840
like two days before they were like we lied.

29:42.400 --> 29:42.880
Gotcha.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.400
And so they've been trying to figure out a way to settle this.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.400
It's not going to cost them like 80 billion euros.

29:49.520 --> 29:52.960
And Volkswagen, can I suggest being the first ones

29:54.000 --> 29:56.720
to the table with this technology?

29:56.720 --> 29:59.120
Replace my horn with these three horns.

29:59.120 --> 30:03.200
And then like, first of all, all will be pardoned.

30:03.920 --> 30:05.520
But second of all, like, I don't know.

30:05.520 --> 30:08.080
I feel like I'll be the leader of cars.

30:08.080 --> 30:09.360
I'll be the king of cars.

30:09.360 --> 30:10.240
Great job.

30:10.240 --> 30:11.120
Great job.

30:11.120 --> 30:12.000
Great job.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.440
Hey, let's go to the money zone.

30:13.440 --> 30:13.920
Great job.

30:13.920 --> 30:28.320
My brother, my brother and me is supported in part by Harry's.

30:28.320 --> 30:28.960
Which part?

30:28.960 --> 30:29.520
Which part?

30:29.520 --> 30:30.320
Which part?

30:30.320 --> 30:38.560
The butt shaving set comes with a copper plated razor handle.

30:38.560 --> 30:42.960
A couple of five blade cartridges, shaving cream,

30:42.960 --> 30:45.360
and a cool travel kit to hold everything.

30:45.360 --> 30:48.400
Hey, what is this bag that has all your shaving stuff in it?

30:48.400 --> 30:49.920
Oh, that's my travel kit.

30:49.920 --> 30:51.920
What is this bag of loose shaving cream?

30:51.920 --> 30:53.680
It's, it's cool.

30:53.680 --> 30:54.720
Yeah, it is.

30:54.720 --> 30:57.360
Holiday shaving sets are all different price points.

30:57.360 --> 30:58.080

31:20.160 --> 31:23.520

I got a different sponsor this week.

31:25.200 --> 31:30.080
This one sponsored my tummy and it's Squarespace.

31:30.080 --> 31:31.360
I know when I said that you thought, well,

31:31.360 --> 31:33.680
this is probably going to be some sort of edible product.

31:33.680 --> 31:34.880
No, it's Squarespace.

31:34.880 --> 31:36.560
Although these designs are so delicious,

31:36.560 --> 31:39.600
I feel like I'm eating them when I go to a Squarespace website.

31:39.600 --> 31:40.960
But it's too many bites.

31:41.920 --> 31:45.600
Okay, so Squarespace is the all-in-one website platform.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.520
Squarespace sites look professionally designed,

31:47.520 --> 31:50.800

31:59.200 --> 32:01.440

32:01.440 --> 32:04.480
Squarespace, build it beautiful.

32:04.480 --> 32:06.480
Griffin, what would your trial website be?

32:07.680 --> 32:08.400
Oh my gosh.

32:10.160 --> 32:11.760
Probably some sort of manifesto.

32:12.320 --> 32:12.820
Nice.

32:15.040 --> 32:17.200
You hear that and you think it sounds negative.

32:17.200 --> 32:18.800
It would be like a positive manifesto.

32:19.440 --> 32:20.800
A humanifesto.

32:20.800 --> 32:22.080
Yeah, just like, hey, cut it out.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.240
We have some personal messages

32:26.240 --> 32:29.280
and they have sponsored the part of the show

32:29.280 --> 32:32.400
that is my neck, my back, my pussy, and my crack.

32:32.400 --> 32:32.880
God, no, I can't say.

32:32.880 --> 32:38.800
It's Brent and Jody get a message from Bobby and Chris.

32:38.800 --> 32:42.320
They say, congratulations on bringing another tiny human

32:42.320 --> 32:43.200
into the world.

32:43.200 --> 32:46.480
Hoping you and Jody are doing well and taking it easy.

32:46.480 --> 32:49.040
Here's wishing you two more happy times ahead

32:49.040 --> 32:51.120
with your new little lady.

32:51.120 --> 32:53.200
High fives all around.

32:53.200 --> 32:54.960
I hope from Bobby and Chris.

32:54.960 --> 32:56.240
And it goes to Brent and Jody.

32:56.240 --> 32:59.360
And thank you for having one normal,

33:00.400 --> 33:02.080
hopefully they're not referencing-

33:02.080 --> 33:05.360
It's safe for the introduction, mon frere.

33:05.360 --> 33:08.800
But Justin, that's assuming they're talking about a baby.

33:08.800 --> 33:10.960
They might be talking about like reaching

33:10.960 --> 33:12.800
into some alternate dimension

33:12.800 --> 33:15.520
and pulling like a David the Gnome sized person

33:15.520 --> 33:16.800
into our reality.

33:16.800 --> 33:19.360
And they've captured her in a bell jar.

33:19.360 --> 33:22.080
Maybe they're referring to like a choice potato salad

33:22.080 --> 33:23.600
they all made together.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.520
And it's like a joke, an end joke between them.

33:25.520 --> 33:26.720
Hopefully it's a human baby.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.680
And that's a nice normal message.

33:29.680 --> 33:33.360
And I'm sorry that I spoilt it with my nonsense.

33:34.720 --> 33:37.840
This one unsponsored the shit Justin said.

33:37.840 --> 33:40.480
So these two sponsorships cancel each other out.

33:40.480 --> 33:43.200
This message is for Brain Coral.

33:43.200 --> 33:46.320
And it's from Insign, am I pronouncing that right?

33:46.320 --> 33:46.720
Ensign.

33:47.360 --> 33:48.080
Whatever.

33:48.080 --> 33:50.320
Ensign Ellie and the Fluff Monster.

33:51.040 --> 33:54.640
Ensign Ellie and the Fluff Monster say to Brain Coral-

33:54.640 --> 33:56.880
Mornings at 5 a.m. on K-Flunk.

33:56.880 --> 33:59.760
Happy two years boodle doodle.

33:59.760 --> 34:02.960
I appreciate you and our best friendship so much much.

34:02.960 --> 34:05.520
I love your big blonde noggin and paddle feet

34:05.520 --> 34:08.480
going on movie dates and listening to the brothers together.

34:08.480 --> 34:11.600
Thank you for letting me use your body to learn anatomy

34:11.600 --> 34:14.240
and keeping me sane with cuddles in the boudoir.

34:14.240 --> 34:16.800
Stick with me kid and I will show you the world.

34:18.960 --> 34:20.000
Very personal.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.120
Very, very personal message.

34:21.120 --> 34:22.960
Do they mean for us to read that out loud?

34:22.960 --> 34:24.960
Oh, it says here, please don't read this.

34:24.960 --> 34:28.240
Oh, oh no, it's just this sponsorship.

34:28.240 --> 34:30.800
They paid us money just to read these words.

34:30.800 --> 34:31.920
They wanted us to know.

34:32.480 --> 34:35.280
Yeah, know about our love please.

34:35.280 --> 34:37.280
Congratulations on your two years.

34:37.280 --> 34:41.280
I am also celebrating my two year wedding anniversary today.

34:41.280 --> 34:41.600
Nice.

34:41.600 --> 34:43.360
With my lovely wife Rachel.

34:43.360 --> 34:44.160
What did you get her?

34:45.600 --> 34:48.000
It doesn't matter because Amazon didn't deliver it yet.

34:48.000 --> 34:48.400
Nice.

34:48.400 --> 34:49.840
Pretty cool job Amazon.

34:49.840 --> 34:52.480
We'll run a little late on that one but no big deal.

34:52.480 --> 34:55.520
But anyway, why were you down to the last moment?

34:55.520 --> 34:57.520
I didn't, it was supposed to be her Thursday

34:57.520 --> 34:59.360
and they done fucked the bed, didn't they?

34:59.360 --> 35:00.080
Nice.

35:00.080 --> 35:02.400
They done took a dump right in my anniversary bed.

35:02.400 --> 35:02.880
Great job.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.200
No, not great job.

35:05.200 --> 35:06.320
I hit the wrong button.

35:06.320 --> 35:07.040
Oh, damn it.

35:07.040 --> 35:08.800
This is gonna be the problem with these horns

35:08.800 --> 35:10.000
until we get them figured out.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.600
Hey everyone, we're the Flophouse,

35:11.600 --> 35:15.440
one of the newest additions to the Maximum Fun Podcasting Network.

35:15.440 --> 35:16.640
I'm Dan McCoy.

35:16.640 --> 35:17.840
I'm Stuart Wellington.

35:17.840 --> 35:19.360
And I'm Elliot Kalin.

35:19.360 --> 35:22.080
What is the Flophouse, you may very well ask.

35:22.080 --> 35:24.320
We watch a bad movie and then we talk about it.

35:24.320 --> 35:25.600
A bad movie podcast,

35:25.600 --> 35:28.160
isn't that like every fifth podcast on the internet?

35:28.160 --> 35:29.440
I'd answer that by saying,

35:29.440 --> 35:31.840
one, we've been doing this show for over seven years,

35:31.840 --> 35:34.960
long before the entire premise of our show was a cliche,

35:34.960 --> 35:36.480
and two, shut up.

35:36.480 --> 35:37.680
Sick bird.

35:37.680 --> 35:40.400
I'd say that our show is more of a comedy podcast.

35:40.400 --> 35:42.800
A podcast about words that sound like other words,

35:42.800 --> 35:47.440
a podcast about me singing long irritating songs like this one,

35:47.440 --> 35:50.400
a podcast about pitches for a Ziggy comic book movie,

35:50.400 --> 35:52.640
or discussions about sex tarps.

35:52.640 --> 35:55.120
Yeah, I mean, mostly it's a show about three friends

35:55.120 --> 35:58.240
just hanging out and talking about ding-dongs.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.280
That's mostly used to.

35:59.280 --> 36:00.080
Wait, what?

36:00.080 --> 36:01.920

36:07.920 --> 36:08.960
The Flophouse.

36:09.600 --> 36:10.880
I got another question for you.

36:10.880 --> 36:12.240
How about Yahoo, actually?

36:12.240 --> 36:13.440
I just said that.

36:13.440 --> 36:15.120
I just said it, if you'd listen for a second.

36:15.120 --> 36:18.720
This Yahoo was sent in by Rachel Roseng, Game Recognized Game.

36:18.720 --> 36:20.000
Rachel Roseng, thank you, Rachel.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.840
It's by Yahoo Answers User.

36:22.480 --> 36:23.840
Ooh, they're anonymous.

36:23.840 --> 36:24.960
Let's call them.

36:24.960 --> 36:25.440
Let's see.

36:26.080 --> 36:26.800
Anonymous.

36:28.080 --> 36:28.880
Shenonymous.

36:29.520 --> 36:30.800
Shanana.

36:30.800 --> 36:31.600
Shanana.

36:31.600 --> 36:33.120
Bowser from Shanana.

36:33.120 --> 36:34.640
Bowser from Shanana says,

36:36.240 --> 36:39.120
why do some injections you have to get in the butt?

36:41.200 --> 36:43.120
I had to get a penicillin shot earlier

36:43.120 --> 36:46.640
and the nurse said this one needed to go on my behind.

36:46.640 --> 36:50.480
I honestly really did not feel like going there.

36:50.480 --> 36:52.880
Any place below the belt for me is examined

36:52.880 --> 36:56.480
on an absolutely positively need to basis.

36:57.200 --> 36:59.040
So I told her I'll take it in the arm.

36:59.040 --> 37:00.960
She said, you don't want it there, trust me.

37:00.960 --> 37:02.880
I've been doing this 22 years.

37:02.880 --> 37:05.440
I didn't have to pull my pants all the way down,

37:05.440 --> 37:07.600
but still I just didn't like that

37:07.600 --> 37:09.520
and really would have preferred elsewhere.

37:09.520 --> 37:10.800
I know she was just doing her job,

37:10.800 --> 37:12.240
but what difference does it make

37:12.240 --> 37:14.800
whether it goes in the arm or wherever?

37:14.800 --> 37:17.440
One way or another, it goes right into that bloodstream.

37:17.440 --> 37:18.480
Isn't that what matters?

37:19.200 --> 37:22.720
Okay, what qualifies as a need to basis

37:22.720 --> 37:26.160
if it's not a nurse saying I have to give you penicillin?

37:26.160 --> 37:28.960
What greater need is there to show your butt

37:28.960 --> 37:29.840
to a professional?

37:30.400 --> 37:30.900
Yeah.

37:32.080 --> 37:34.080
Well, they're arguing that that shot

37:34.080 --> 37:35.680
is gonna end up in the blood anyway,

37:35.680 --> 37:36.560
so you can put it anywhere.

37:36.560 --> 37:37.920
You can put it in between my toes.

37:39.200 --> 37:42.800
You can put it in my crankshaft.

37:42.800 --> 37:44.000
You can put it wherever you want.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.200
It's just like, why my butt?

37:47.360 --> 37:51.200
Your butt seems like it's pretty far away from you.

37:52.240 --> 37:54.640
It's like a real melting pot.

37:54.640 --> 37:58.240
Yeah, who knows what's going on down there half the time?

37:58.240 --> 38:00.160
And your butt is so far away from you

38:01.280 --> 38:02.160
that from your head and your face and stuff.

38:02.160 --> 38:04.080
You've said that three times down.

38:04.080 --> 38:05.120
It doesn't make any sense.

38:05.120 --> 38:06.080
Well, think about it, Griffin.

38:06.080 --> 38:08.640
Picture it in the world of like Osmosis Jones, right?

38:08.640 --> 38:11.600
Like if you went to the butt in Osmosis Jones,

38:11.600 --> 38:12.240
what would be there?

38:12.240 --> 38:13.920
And I feel like it would be like the wilderness.

38:13.920 --> 38:16.720
I feel like it would be like we have to travel to the butt

38:16.720 --> 38:18.000
like they were saying Mordor.

38:18.000 --> 38:18.640
You know what I mean?

38:19.520 --> 38:21.840
Yeah, the butt seems like it's really far away.

38:21.840 --> 38:23.600
What if in Osmosis Jones,

38:24.320 --> 38:27.120
David Hyde Pierce, who played the pill guy,

38:27.760 --> 38:31.120
was a suppository and that was how he was introduced

38:31.120 --> 38:33.680
was there was a long scene where Bill Murray

38:33.680 --> 38:35.920
had to jam a little David Hyde Pierce

38:36.560 --> 38:38.560
right into his asshole.

38:38.560 --> 38:40.320
While DHP just screamed.

38:40.320 --> 38:43.840
While DHP was like, no, I'm a mouth pill.

38:43.840 --> 38:45.840
Please, no, I was on Frasier.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.680
I got an answer from Sydney.

38:50.720 --> 38:52.480
She is my wife's a physician

38:52.480 --> 38:55.360
and I got an official answer here from her.

38:55.360 --> 38:57.760
And it says butt blood is the most important blood.

38:57.760 --> 38:59.280
Thanks, Sydney for the, wow.

38:59.840 --> 39:01.120
Wouldn't have expected that.

39:01.120 --> 39:03.840
But I said, why does shots go in the butt?

39:03.840 --> 39:06.880
She says, there's just a lot of tissue there.

39:06.880 --> 39:08.160
Muscle and fat and stuff.

39:08.160 --> 39:12.000
More so than in the deltoid, whatever that is.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.160
Sounds like she's making shit up.

39:14.160 --> 39:16.720
It's arm cannons, like these babies.

39:16.720 --> 39:18.000
I guess what she's saying is,

39:18.000 --> 39:19.760
because the butt's so juicy.

39:19.760 --> 39:21.920
Because he got that juicy bit.

39:21.920 --> 39:25.760
Because the butt's so juicy.

39:25.760 --> 39:26.800
Cheese pizza.

39:28.640 --> 39:31.600
A juicy cheese pizza butt.

39:31.600 --> 39:33.600
Got that juicy butt, Kevin.

39:34.160 --> 39:36.320
Also, and she just texted me,

39:36.320 --> 39:38.240
also doctors like to look at butts.

39:38.240 --> 39:40.720
But don't tell anyone, that is a secret.

39:40.720 --> 39:42.320
No, she broke the Hippocratic Oath.

39:42.320 --> 39:45.360
That's the second codicil of the Hippocratic Oath.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.840
Do no harm and look at butts.

39:47.840 --> 39:48.800
No, it's do no harm

39:48.800 --> 39:51.280
and don't tell anyone about our butt secret.

39:51.280 --> 39:53.040
Love, love Hippocrates.

39:54.160 --> 39:54.880
Oh, man.

39:56.720 --> 39:57.520
Butts are juicy.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.880
Did you guys know, by the way,

40:01.120 --> 40:03.840
I'm trying to see more versions of the Christmas Carol

40:03.840 --> 40:05.040
because there's just the few.

40:05.040 --> 40:07.760
There's so, so, so many out there.

40:07.760 --> 40:10.400
And I think people tend to hue to the ones

40:10.400 --> 40:13.200
that they're the most familiar with.

40:14.400 --> 40:17.520
Did you guys know there is an animated Christmas Carol

40:17.520 --> 40:21.840
from 1997 that features as Mr. Scrooge,

40:23.280 --> 40:24.480
a young Tim Curry.

40:25.280 --> 40:27.920
Our friend and nearest, Tim Curry.

40:27.920 --> 40:30.080
And as if that cast couldn't,

40:30.080 --> 40:33.200
like that cast is already like pretty good.

40:33.200 --> 40:36.560
Who is that as the spirit of Christmas present?

40:36.560 --> 40:38.320
Why, it's Whippy Goldberg.

40:39.600 --> 40:42.400
Man, together again.

40:42.400 --> 40:44.800
Yeah, and who snuck in there is Marley.

40:44.800 --> 40:46.880
Well, it's your friend of mine, Ed Asner.

40:46.880 --> 40:48.560
That's a really good cast.

40:50.160 --> 40:51.920
If I was making a dream cast,

40:52.880 --> 40:54.880
I would play Sonic.

40:59.280 --> 40:59.840
That would be.

40:59.840 --> 41:04.880
What if Sonic the Hedgehog was the ghost of Christmas past?

41:04.880 --> 41:07.680
Why do you have to inject shots into my Sonic the Hedgehog?

41:07.680 --> 41:12.560
I think what if, what would be the best Dickens story

41:13.200 --> 41:16.880
to put Sonic the Hedgehog inside?

41:16.880 --> 41:20.160
And I think it would go a little something like this.

41:20.160 --> 41:21.840
It was the worst of cheese dogs.

41:21.840 --> 41:23.760
It was the best of cheese dogs.

41:23.760 --> 41:24.800
Or did I get that right?

41:24.800 --> 41:26.480
Chili dogs, my dude.

41:26.480 --> 41:28.000
Listen, it's been a long time.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.440
Do you know that that was Urkel?

41:29.440 --> 41:31.120
Sorry, I just wanted to tell everybody

41:31.120 --> 41:34.160
about my other favorite version of Christmas Carol.

41:34.160 --> 41:38.800
This one's a little bit of basically

41:38.800 --> 41:40.320
the weirdest one that exists.

41:40.960 --> 41:42.880
And you guys will be like kicking yourself

41:42.880 --> 41:44.560
that you didn't know this was like a thing

41:45.840 --> 41:50.240
because it stars as Scrooge, Simon Callow.

41:50.240 --> 41:51.200
Not that interesting.

41:52.800 --> 41:55.440
Michael Gambon is in there as the ghost of Christmas present.

41:55.440 --> 41:56.000
Into that.

41:56.560 --> 41:57.680
Yeah, no problem at all.

41:57.680 --> 42:02.160
And then we have as Belle,

42:02.160 --> 42:05.840
you know, young Scrooge's love interest is Kate Winslet.

42:05.840 --> 42:09.440
And then who's that bringing up the rear as Marley?

42:10.400 --> 42:13.280
Why, it's Nicholas Cage.

42:13.280 --> 42:14.080
What?

42:14.080 --> 42:14.480
What?

42:15.760 --> 42:17.680
What, no, where, is this an animated?

42:17.680 --> 42:20.400
They got Nick Cage for their animated Christmas Carol.

42:20.400 --> 42:21.360
No, I've seen this.

42:21.360 --> 42:22.480
I've seen this.

42:22.480 --> 42:23.840
It was on Netflix.

42:23.840 --> 42:24.960
I was like, time to watch Scrooge.

42:24.960 --> 42:26.240
Oh, Scrooge isn't on Netflix.

42:26.240 --> 42:27.040
Let's watch this one.

42:27.040 --> 42:28.640
And it's like demented.

42:28.640 --> 42:29.840
It's demented, right?

42:31.040 --> 42:33.520
It's mainly about mice and they take a lot

42:33.520 --> 42:37.280
of really weird licenses with the story.

42:37.280 --> 42:39.600
Also in that version, he gets back together with Belle

42:39.600 --> 42:41.600
and they're both old and they get back together.

42:41.600 --> 42:43.760
Like it's not that, it's a happy ending.

42:43.760 --> 42:45.200
It's not that happy, guys.

42:45.760 --> 42:47.520
She hasn't been waiting for Scrooge.

42:47.520 --> 42:50.560
No, in like six months, Scrooge is bankrupt.

42:50.560 --> 42:51.040
Yeah.

42:51.040 --> 42:53.360
That's how Christmas Carol ends.

42:53.360 --> 42:54.480
That's the follow-up.

42:54.480 --> 42:56.000
That's the placard that comes up.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.360
That's the title card.

42:57.360 --> 42:59.600
Six months later, he was in a gutter

42:59.600 --> 43:01.600
because he's an old man and he gave away all his money.

43:02.560 --> 43:03.520
When he needs it the most.

43:03.520 --> 43:04.480
He needs it the most.

43:05.920 --> 43:07.280
This was the time he was saving for

43:07.280 --> 43:08.480
and he was giving it all away.

43:08.480 --> 43:11.440
And it's not like life is easy in like Elizabethan

43:11.440 --> 43:13.520
or whatever it was, Victorian London.

43:13.520 --> 43:14.240
Like it's tough.

43:14.240 --> 43:15.600
And he's just giving it away.

43:16.560 --> 43:18.400
There's a balance, Scrooge.

43:18.400 --> 43:19.680
There's a balance.

43:19.680 --> 43:22.560
I got a fucking choice when coming out at you hot.

43:22.560 --> 43:25.040
What is the etiquette when eating at a buffet?

43:25.040 --> 43:26.640
Specifically, when standing up

43:26.640 --> 43:28.480
and going to replenish your plate of food?

43:28.480 --> 43:31.280
Do I wait for a natural break of the conversation?

43:31.280 --> 43:33.040
Do I wait for the other person to stand up

43:33.040 --> 43:34.240
and get another plate?

43:34.240 --> 43:35.840
Or do I stand up in the middle of them talking?

43:35.840 --> 43:37.920
Almost as if to imply that in three minutes

43:37.920 --> 43:40.800
they will still be there, but the crab legs might not be.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.200
Oh, that's a good question.

43:44.080 --> 43:45.120
That is a good question.

43:45.120 --> 43:48.160
I love that there's no like catchy nickname on this one

43:48.160 --> 43:50.080
because they wanted to provide as little evidence

43:50.080 --> 43:52.400
as they possibly could that would allow people

43:52.400 --> 43:54.480
to track them down and find out their true identity

43:54.480 --> 43:56.800
based on the subject matter of this question.

43:58.160 --> 44:01.440
Hungry buffet boy in Biloxi.

44:01.440 --> 44:04.800
You know, I encountered like not exactly the same thing

44:04.800 --> 44:07.440
but I went to a barcade, a bar arcade

44:07.440 --> 44:08.880
but it was actually mostly a restaurant

44:09.440 --> 44:10.960
and we ordered food.

44:10.960 --> 44:12.880
It was like a sit down restaurant

44:12.880 --> 44:16.320
but also the walls were lined with arcade games

44:16.320 --> 44:18.480
and like they brought us our tokens

44:18.480 --> 44:19.600
and then it's like-

44:19.600 --> 44:20.640
Sorry, sorry, bud.

44:21.520 --> 44:23.120
You're talking about a Damon Busters?

44:23.120 --> 44:25.840
No, no, it was like a Japanese restaurant

44:25.840 --> 44:28.480
that also had like gauntlet.

44:28.480 --> 44:29.520
It was awesome.

44:29.520 --> 44:32.640
It was the best, but at what point-

44:32.640 --> 44:33.840
Dave San and Buster San.

44:34.960 --> 44:36.800
What is the appropriate time to be like

44:36.800 --> 44:39.680
and I'm done with this adult conversation

44:39.680 --> 44:42.080
and I'm gonna go play NBA Jam now.

44:42.080 --> 44:44.480
Yeah, that definitely adds another layer to it.

44:44.480 --> 44:46.640
The only thing you could do in that situation, Travis

44:46.640 --> 44:50.560
is just excruciatingly slowly

44:50.560 --> 44:53.280
just keep stepping back away from the conversation

44:53.280 --> 44:55.520
until they suddenly realize they're shouting

44:55.520 --> 44:56.560
and you're playing NBA Jam.

44:56.560 --> 44:57.600
No, fuck that.

44:57.600 --> 44:59.840
The better solution is like on Doubt and Happy

44:59.840 --> 45:01.600
when they're like, well, dinner's over.

45:01.600 --> 45:05.280
I suggest we move this conversation to the drawing room.

45:05.280 --> 45:06.320
Just do something like that.

45:06.320 --> 45:08.560
Like, well, we've eaten all the pizza

45:08.560 --> 45:09.840
we're probably going to eat.

45:09.840 --> 45:13.520
Why don't we continue this thrilling conversation

45:13.520 --> 45:15.200
over a round of gauntlet?

45:15.200 --> 45:20.720
Brandy and cigars around the Frogger machine.

45:20.720 --> 45:23.120
Who's up for some Tapper?

45:23.120 --> 45:25.440
Oh man, Tapper is so good, you guys.

45:25.440 --> 45:27.040
I'm not gonna fucking talk about Tapper with you.

45:27.040 --> 45:29.600
Here's the fun thing that I encountered at this restaurant.

45:30.480 --> 45:34.240
Like at no point can all four people get up from the table,

45:35.040 --> 45:35.280
right?

45:35.280 --> 45:37.680
Because that's a sign that you're done.

45:38.400 --> 45:40.880
So it's like, you have to leave someone down

45:40.880 --> 45:46.240
like to pin down the table while you go play like X-Men.

45:46.240 --> 45:49.200
That's a, that is a sacrifice.

45:49.200 --> 45:50.960
They should have some sort of service for that.

45:50.960 --> 45:53.040
You should be able to hire a seat filler

45:53.040 --> 45:54.400
just to hold your position

45:54.400 --> 45:56.320
so you can get some four man Smash TV.

45:56.320 --> 45:58.400
I don't think they were done with these spring rolls.

45:58.400 --> 46:00.080
I think they'll be back in a minute.

46:00.080 --> 46:01.920
Wait a minute, do you play four man Smash TV

46:01.920 --> 46:03.360
or is it just, is it max two?

46:03.360 --> 46:04.080
I think it's just two.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.920
If you actually just put a quarter on the table,

46:07.920 --> 46:10.080
that means that it's like you've got next on it.

46:10.080 --> 46:11.440
So you should be fine there.

46:12.320 --> 46:13.840
But let's get back to the buffet subject

46:13.840 --> 46:16.080
because this is also very important

46:16.080 --> 46:18.080
because I get that sense of constant panic

46:18.640 --> 46:21.600
of, well, I didn't have room on my plate for those,

46:22.720 --> 46:24.400
you know, mashed potatoes.

46:25.280 --> 46:27.760
My first go round, but there weren't that many left.

46:27.760 --> 46:32.320
So I need to slam jam this gravy square

46:32.320 --> 46:34.000
before it's all gone.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.320
Oh, it looks like they just brought out fresh gummy bears.

46:36.320 --> 46:39.680
I have to go now or they're going to be gone.

46:40.240 --> 46:41.440
Got to roll.

46:41.440 --> 46:46.080
One that I find myself stuck in a lot,

46:46.080 --> 46:47.520
it's basically the saddest thing you can do

46:48.080 --> 46:51.920
is I'll be at my favorite Chinese buffet

46:51.920 --> 46:54.000
and they won't have the coconut shrimp I like

46:54.000 --> 46:56.080
and I'm pretty sure they're gonna restock it

46:56.640 --> 46:58.480
but like, cause it's empty.

46:58.480 --> 47:00.560
So of course that's the next natural step.

47:00.560 --> 47:02.400
So you do that thing and you're like waiting

47:02.400 --> 47:04.720
like, oh man, I hope he brings some more out.

47:04.720 --> 47:08.640
It's like waiting for some substandard coconut shrimp.

47:08.640 --> 47:10.560
This is pretty pitiful.

47:10.560 --> 47:13.680
I need some kind of flag system at a table

47:13.680 --> 47:15.680
because I will load up my plate

47:15.680 --> 47:18.240
and then take a bite of one of the things on the plate

47:18.240 --> 47:20.480
and realize, oh, I don't want this anymore.

47:20.480 --> 47:21.360
Oh, that's the worst.

47:21.360 --> 47:23.440
And then it's like, can you like,

47:23.440 --> 47:25.840
you went up thinking it was something with coconut in it.

47:25.840 --> 47:26.960
You got back and took a bite,

47:26.960 --> 47:29.520
turned out it was a corn puzzle

47:29.520 --> 47:30.640
and you're not gonna eat it.

47:30.640 --> 47:32.160
So you want to put it,

47:32.160 --> 47:34.240
but like you do want to go back up to get more.

47:34.240 --> 47:37.120
Right, so I need someone to come clear the plate

47:37.120 --> 47:38.880
and not ask any questions

47:40.720 --> 47:42.400
because I don't want to have to identify

47:42.400 --> 47:44.240
that yes, I'm wasting this.

47:44.240 --> 47:45.440
Oh yeah, no, I'm bad.

47:45.440 --> 47:47.040
I'm a bad, bad eater boy.

47:47.040 --> 47:48.720
And I did not eat this corn puzzle.

47:48.720 --> 47:51.520
Please take it away so that I can go get more,

47:51.520 --> 47:53.120
you know, brownie mess or whatever.

47:53.120 --> 47:55.680
Like that's where I'm at.

47:55.680 --> 47:57.440
I feel like I want the people in my life

47:57.440 --> 47:59.040
who are most important to me to like,

47:59.040 --> 48:02.880
know and understand that when I begin

48:02.880 --> 48:05.440
to have these pangs of food anxiety,

48:06.000 --> 48:07.520
when I'm talking to them,

48:07.520 --> 48:09.840
I'm not engaged in the conversation

48:09.840 --> 48:11.600
in the way that they want me to be,

48:11.600 --> 48:14.320
but it's completely like out of my hands.

48:14.320 --> 48:16.080
And so when I do just like stand up

48:16.080 --> 48:17.360
in the middle of a conversation

48:18.320 --> 48:19.600
and walk to the other side of the room

48:19.600 --> 48:20.640
because they just put out,

48:20.640 --> 48:22.240
you know, it doesn't have to be at a buffet.

48:22.240 --> 48:22.880
We could be at a party

48:22.880 --> 48:24.240
and they just put out a little cheesecake bites

48:24.240 --> 48:26.480
and those are gonna go fucking fast, of course.

48:26.480 --> 48:28.240
Oh, here comes the wave of food anxiety.

48:28.240 --> 48:31.360
And like, what were you saying about your niece

48:31.360 --> 48:34.080
and her sickness?

48:34.080 --> 48:35.600
I really want to be dialed in,

48:35.600 --> 48:37.040
but to me, you're just saying cheesecake,

48:37.040 --> 48:38.160
cheesecake, cheesecake bites.

48:38.160 --> 48:38.800
Yummy, yum, yum.

48:38.800 --> 48:39.840
They taste so good.

48:39.840 --> 48:41.280
They're going, everyone's getting them.

48:41.280 --> 48:42.720
Everyone's taking them from you.

48:42.720 --> 48:44.400
Why can't we just be adults about it?

48:44.400 --> 48:48.320
Say, listen, I love this story so much,

48:48.320 --> 48:50.560
but if I don't sit up and get me some of those

48:50.560 --> 48:54.000
creamy bites, my human life on this planet

48:54.000 --> 48:55.200
will literally end and I will die.

48:55.200 --> 48:56.080
Baby, baby, baby.

48:56.960 --> 48:59.040
This story about your niece's sickness,

48:59.040 --> 49:00.160
it is hot stuff.

49:00.160 --> 49:01.680
I am down with the sickness,

49:01.680 --> 49:03.600
but I have got to go get these cheesecakes.

49:06.240 --> 49:07.520
Well, that's the problem, right?

49:07.520 --> 49:09.120
Cause it would require you to admit,

49:09.120 --> 49:11.040
like if we're being 100% honest,

49:11.040 --> 49:12.480
it would require you to admit

49:12.480 --> 49:14.080
that you're not that interested in stuff

49:14.080 --> 49:15.600
other people are saying usually.

49:15.600 --> 49:18.880
No, unless it's gossip or about you,

49:18.880 --> 49:20.320
it's just not that interesting.

49:20.320 --> 49:21.760
Unless the thing they're saying is

49:21.760 --> 49:25.840
directions to closer secret cheesecake bites.

49:25.840 --> 49:27.600
There's nothing that they could be saying

49:27.600 --> 49:29.680
that would get me more on board

49:29.680 --> 49:32.240
than my sweet, sweet food dream.

49:32.240 --> 49:34.640
Listen, we can all agree that when you go to a buffet,

49:34.640 --> 49:36.960
you are engaging in an activity more so

49:36.960 --> 49:38.880
than just going to a restaurant, right?

49:38.880 --> 49:42.000
Restaurant is we can gab whilst others do the work,

49:42.000 --> 49:43.840
but when you go to a buffet, you're doing the work.

49:43.840 --> 49:46.160
So imagine like if you went mini golfing

49:46.160 --> 49:48.400
and you just focused on the conversation

49:48.400 --> 49:51.200
and no one took their turn swinging a putter,

49:51.200 --> 49:52.240
that would be the worst.

49:52.240 --> 49:54.560
So why can't we agree that we came to this buffet

49:54.560 --> 49:56.160
for one purpose and one purpose only,

49:56.160 --> 49:57.760
and it's to eat as much as we can

49:57.760 --> 49:59.440
and then fall asleep quickly,

49:59.440 --> 50:01.440
hopefully after we get home.

50:01.440 --> 50:04.080
So can we all please focus on the task at hand

50:04.080 --> 50:06.160
and maybe take a nap in the parking lot

50:06.160 --> 50:07.600
while someone holds down the table,

50:07.600 --> 50:09.280
then we come back for thirties,

50:09.280 --> 50:11.520
just be cool for two seconds.

50:11.520 --> 50:12.400
Travis, you've got it.

50:12.960 --> 50:15.040
If the only way that people are gonna get serious

50:15.040 --> 50:18.080
about their food eating at a buffet

50:18.080 --> 50:20.640
and doing the fucking job they came there to do

50:20.640 --> 50:22.880
is if after you ate at a buffet,

50:24.640 --> 50:26.400
a judge came by your table

50:26.400 --> 50:29.280
and critiqued everybody's performance at the buffet.

50:29.280 --> 50:32.960
Like, oh, Marcus, three clean plates, my good boy.

50:32.960 --> 50:34.400
And let me see, what do you got there?

50:34.400 --> 50:36.320
It looks like a little soft serve bowl.

50:36.320 --> 50:39.440
And oh, you went ham on those Oreos crumblings.

50:39.440 --> 50:41.280
You went ham on those Oreos crumblings

50:41.280 --> 50:42.960
on top of that ice cream bowl, didn't you?

50:42.960 --> 50:44.400
Oh my God, great job.

50:44.400 --> 50:46.320
I'm so proud of you.

50:46.320 --> 50:48.720
Here's a little styrofoam airplane

50:48.720 --> 50:50.000
you got put together yourself.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.360
Now, Susan, let me see.

50:51.360 --> 50:53.920
It looks like you didn't even finish your first plate.

50:53.920 --> 50:56.320
You left some of your greenie beanies on there

50:56.320 --> 50:58.000
and then you made a second plate

50:58.000 --> 51:00.080
and it doesn't seem like you put any effort into that at all.

51:00.080 --> 51:02.560
And I can't help but just like constructive criticism.

51:02.560 --> 51:05.600
You talked a lot about your niece and her sickness

51:05.600 --> 51:07.760
and I feel like maybe that detracted

51:07.760 --> 51:09.920
some of like your gross eating time.

51:09.920 --> 51:12.480
That's more of an Applebee's conversation.

51:12.480 --> 51:14.240
This is a golden corral.

51:14.240 --> 51:17.120
That shit, that dog won't hunt.

51:17.120 --> 51:19.200
It's not called golden parlor room.

51:19.200 --> 51:22.480
It's called a corral, which is where pigs eat garbage.

51:24.480 --> 51:27.760
So maybe like knuckle down next time

51:27.760 --> 51:29.760
and focus on the task at hand.

51:29.760 --> 51:33.360
I do have to point out that that's a trough.

51:34.640 --> 51:37.920
But you don't just have a loose trough, Justin.

51:37.920 --> 51:40.160
Keep horses and stuff.

51:40.160 --> 51:42.640
Well, there can be pigs there too, show pigs.

51:42.640 --> 51:44.080
Anyway, I think I made a good point.

51:44.080 --> 51:45.600
Please don't fall asleep on the drive home

51:45.600 --> 51:46.880
because you just ate a golden corral

51:46.880 --> 51:48.000
and that's the next logical step.

51:48.000 --> 51:49.680
No, you have to time it out, Justin.

51:49.680 --> 51:50.800
That's what I was saying.

51:50.800 --> 51:51.920
Because if you get to the car

51:51.920 --> 51:53.680
and you're like 15 minutes to get home,

51:53.680 --> 51:55.920
nope, not gonna make it, you nap right there.

51:55.920 --> 51:57.760
Like when you pull your 18 wheeler over

51:57.760 --> 51:58.640
by the side of the road,

51:58.640 --> 52:01.440
because you know that your buzzers have worn off

52:01.440 --> 52:03.120
or whatever and you're gonna fall asleep.

52:03.120 --> 52:04.880
You do that in the golden corral parking lot,

52:04.880 --> 52:06.720
which is why they provide like sleep masks

52:06.720 --> 52:07.760
as you walk out the door.

52:08.400 --> 52:11.840
Alternately, you just have a fourth horn

52:11.840 --> 52:15.680
that is a toggle, a constant low level horn

52:15.680 --> 52:17.600
emanating from your car that communicates,

52:17.600 --> 52:19.360
hey, I just entered a buffet.

52:19.360 --> 52:21.360
Please give me a wide berth.

52:21.360 --> 52:26.160
It says I have a slo-mo crash into the girder.

52:26.160 --> 52:29.520
We need bumpers at a little kid's bowling party.

52:32.320 --> 52:34.080
Please let me ease into the girder.

52:34.080 --> 52:36.480
It's also the best time to call a Lyft ever

52:36.480 --> 52:39.440
in case you're way better than you got too drunk to drive.

52:40.160 --> 52:42.720
There should just be a special golden corral Lyft service.

52:43.280 --> 52:46.240
Yeah, it is a button the size of your phone

52:46.240 --> 52:47.520
that appears on your phone

52:47.520 --> 52:50.080
when the GPS detects you're in a golden corral

52:50.080 --> 52:51.520
and it's just the size of your phone

52:51.520 --> 52:54.400
so that if you fall asleep, if you land on your phone,

52:54.400 --> 52:58.080
a Lyft driver will be there to carry you home to slumberland.

52:58.080 --> 52:59.280
I'm not too drunk to drive.

52:59.280 --> 53:00.640
I'm too full to live.

53:00.640 --> 53:02.640
And I mean, I need a ride home.

53:02.640 --> 53:03.440
Take me home, Marcus.

53:03.440 --> 53:06.000
Hey, let's wrap this show up.

53:06.000 --> 53:06.240
Yeah.

53:06.240 --> 53:08.080
I think we've done all we can do here.

53:08.640 --> 53:09.920
This has been My Brother, My Brother, Me.

53:09.920 --> 53:11.600
It's an advice show for the modern era.

53:12.160 --> 53:13.840
We hope you've had a lot of fun.

53:13.840 --> 53:16.080
Just to remind you a couple quick things,

53:16.720 --> 53:18.000
head over to our Facebook group.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.840
It's the My Brother, My Brother, Me Appreciation group,

53:19.840 --> 53:20.480
I think it's called.

53:21.040 --> 53:23.280
And you'll find some details about how to help some folks.

53:23.280 --> 53:24.640
I'll get that set up as soon as we're done here.

53:25.200 --> 53:26.240
I haven't actually done it yet.

53:27.120 --> 53:30.240
We're doing a candle night show, speaking of candle nights.

53:30.240 --> 53:31.360
I hope it's begun for you all.

53:31.360 --> 53:33.200
But if it hasn't, don't worry, it'll come.

53:33.200 --> 53:34.000
Don't try to force it.

53:34.000 --> 53:34.720
You'll hurt yourself.

53:35.440 --> 53:37.280
But if you want to come see our candle night show,

53:38.640 --> 53:40.720
which is a foolproof way to put yourself in the spirit,

53:41.440 --> 53:44.480
go to bit.ly forward slash candle nights two.

53:44.480 --> 53:48.560
That's in Huntington, West Virginia, December 21st at 8 p.m.

53:48.560 --> 53:51.520
It's us and Sawbones, 20 bucks.

53:51.520 --> 53:53.120
It'll be a hoot and a half.

53:53.120 --> 53:56.240
We've sold about 80% of the tickets for that show.

53:56.240 --> 53:57.520
So if you do want tickets,

53:57.520 --> 54:00.160
you're gonna want to pounce on those stat.

54:00.960 --> 54:02.080
And it's a real good time.

54:02.080 --> 54:04.160
We do it as PG-13 as possible.

54:04.160 --> 54:06.320
So if you've got family in the area,

54:06.320 --> 54:08.960
or you just want to carpool down with some friends

54:08.960 --> 54:11.600
and do something stupid during your Christmas break,

54:11.600 --> 54:13.840
it's a great opportunity to do something stupid.

54:13.840 --> 54:16.720
Also, so we just had some Adventure Zone,

54:16.720 --> 54:18.480
which is the Dungeons and Dragons podcast

54:18.480 --> 54:19.520
that we do with our dad.

54:19.520 --> 54:20.880
We had some merch go up.

54:20.880 --> 54:23.360
It's a really awesome dry erase board,

54:24.000 --> 54:25.920
dry erase board character sheet

54:25.920 --> 54:27.680
that was done for us by Justin Gray.

54:28.560 --> 54:31.680
And also a t-shirt that was designed for us by Leon Roselar.

54:32.720 --> 54:36.400
And the posters from our Pacific Northwest show

54:36.400 --> 54:38.160
that were drawn by Emily Carroll,

54:38.160 --> 54:42.720
they are now up for sale on the Max Fund store as well.

54:42.720 --> 54:44.720
There's not a ton of those in memory.

54:44.720 --> 54:47.840
Like it's the leftover ones we did not sell on the tour.

54:47.840 --> 54:49.360
And when they're gone, they're gone.

54:49.360 --> 54:51.200
So like they're not gonna print anymore.

54:51.200 --> 54:53.680
These are just what we had left.

54:53.680 --> 54:55.440
They are absolutely beautiful.

54:55.440 --> 54:56.640
If you haven't seen them, go check them out.

54:56.640 --> 54:59.360
There's also just a ton of other Max Fund merch on there.

55:00.400 --> 55:03.920
The easiest way to find it is go to maxfundstore.com

55:03.920 --> 55:05.200
and it will redirect you to there.

55:05.200 --> 55:09.360
And there's a ton of awesome shit, I should say.

55:09.360 --> 55:11.280
And it's a lot of really great ideas

55:11.280 --> 55:12.400
for Christmas presents and stuff.

55:12.400 --> 55:13.360
So go check that out.

55:13.360 --> 55:15.200
I wanna thank John Roderick in the long winters

55:15.200 --> 55:16.160
for the use of our theme song.

55:16.160 --> 55:18.320
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

55:19.040 --> 55:21.360
It's a good winter time album.

55:21.360 --> 55:24.480
Lot of warm tracks there to heat up your chilly bones.

55:25.360 --> 55:27.200

56:06.400 --> 56:07.600
Yeah, I love that name, everybody.

56:07.600 --> 56:09.120
It's a fucking the best name.

Thank you.

56:09.440 --> 56:12.320
Yeah, I wanna say happy anniversary to my wife again.

56:12.320 --> 56:14.800
Ew, gross.

56:14.800 --> 56:15.360
That'll be $100.

56:17.040 --> 56:18.160
No, I take it back.

56:19.360 --> 56:20.240
All right, fair enough.

56:21.520 --> 56:23.600
Thank you all so much for joining us.

56:23.600 --> 56:25.360

a surefire way, get out and do something nice for somebody.

56:30.720 --> 56:33.040

56:33.040 --> 56:35.440

56:35.440 --> 56:37.840
Absolutely, a duet sent in by Zoe Kinski,

56:37.840 --> 56:38.640
climbing that ladder.

56:38.640 --> 56:39.280
Thank you, Zoe.

56:39.280 --> 56:42.080
It's by Yahoo Answers user Sir, who asks,

56:44.240 --> 56:46.880
how does ghost Pokemon sex work?

56:48.880 --> 56:50.080
My name is Justin McElroy.

56:50.080 --> 56:51.280
I'm Travis McElroy.

56:52.640 --> 56:54.880
It's a fair point because when you mate

56:55.680 --> 56:58.960
a two ghost Pokemon in daycare, they produce an egg.

56:58.960 --> 56:59.760
What the fuck?

57:00.320 --> 57:01.440
This has been my brother, my brother.

57:01.440 --> 57:11.040
Make your dad square on the lips.

57:29.600 --> 57:31.920
On Throwing Shade, we look at an issue important to ladies

57:31.920 --> 57:33.440
and an issue important to gay people.

57:33.440 --> 57:34.880
And then we basically make fun of it.

57:34.880 --> 57:36.640
Yeah, and just to answer your question,

57:36.640 --> 57:38.000
no, we don't have a marriage pact.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.480
But if we don't get married by the time we're 30,

57:40.480 --> 57:41.920
we're going to do that for each other.

57:41.920 --> 57:42.240
That's true.

57:42.240 --> 58:00.000
Although we have each been divorced three times.
