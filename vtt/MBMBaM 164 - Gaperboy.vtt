WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.160
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and my show from the modern era. I'm

00:48.160 --> 00:53.280
your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your millis brother, Travis McElroy.

00:53.280 --> 00:57.040
I'm your sweetest, sweetest baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:57.040 --> 01:03.600
Uh, and today we're celebrating the discovery of a new mammalian.

01:03.600 --> 01:08.480
The launch. Can we call it that today is the much anticipated release.

01:08.480 --> 01:13.520
You've seen the trailers and today we are finally ready to launch.

01:13.520 --> 01:16.560
This is the street date. This is the mammal street date.

01:16.560 --> 01:19.840
A lot of people have been asking, what's this mammal gonna do for me?

01:19.840 --> 01:24.800
Is he going to produce lots of sweet, sweet, low-cal, gluten-free milk

01:24.800 --> 01:29.120
that I can, that I can buy at the Whole Foods? Maybe. We haven't drank this bitch's milk yet.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.360
Will he be Bluetooth compatible?

01:31.360 --> 01:35.760
So, uh, before the program, we were discussing different topics that we could discuss in this

01:35.760 --> 01:42.320
opening segment, uh, and I said there was a new mammal in the mix. Griffin had heard about it.

01:42.320 --> 01:47.040
Travis hadn't, at which point he insisted he didn't want to hear about it because he wanted

01:47.040 --> 01:56.160
to guess. Now, just to be clear, there's an undiscovered species of animal, unknown to

01:56.160 --> 02:06.080
humanity, and Travis is going- Travis should, Travis should be like, uh, an epidemiologist

02:06.080 --> 02:11.360
or something. Like, Travis, cancer can, can spit some fire at us. Just, let's just,

02:12.000 --> 02:15.120
I'm going to start you with cancer and let's just see what you got. Uh, let me guess.

02:15.120 --> 02:18.960
Have you tried- Let me, okay, hold on. All that aside. Have you tried? I need one,

02:18.960 --> 02:23.040
I just need one bit of information. Okay. Where was it discovered?

02:23.840 --> 02:28.640
It was discovered in Ecuador or Colombia. I think- Uh, let me mention real quick before

02:28.640 --> 02:34.400
we say anything else. This is a rare evening recording, uh, and at least two-thirds of the

02:34.400 --> 02:38.800
podcast have been rigging, so it's going to be a good one, but just for some context there.

02:38.800 --> 02:43.600
Oh, that was, that was one of us just blew into our breathalyzer, and that was like,

02:43.600 --> 02:50.160
don't drive. That's the chime that stands for funny. Keys, please hand them to me. Record.

02:50.160 --> 02:57.360
You're not good to go. I am going to say a barefooted monkey. You're not,

02:57.360 --> 03:00.800
you're not so far off, although I guess you are super far off because we did,

03:00.800 --> 03:06.560
we lowered the phylum down to mammal. No, but I'm just, I'm going to say when I say barefooted,

03:06.560 --> 03:10.880
not like it's not wearing shoes. I mean like it's a monkey with like B-E-A-R feet.

03:10.880 --> 03:14.560
Did you get that spelling right? Yeah, with bear-like feet.

03:15.200 --> 03:21.680
Uh, what we got is the Olinguito. It is a raccoon with the face of a teddy bear.

03:21.680 --> 03:26.640
All right. First of all, first of all, we've been, we've been getting sold a fucking false

03:26.640 --> 03:30.960
bill of goods all day by the science, by the Christian science monitor that's like,

03:30.960 --> 03:35.920
oh, look at this adorable thing. I don't want to, I don't want to throw shade at this new mammal,

03:36.960 --> 03:40.560
but I'm not really feeling it. Like it's not fair. It's not all that cute. And look at those

03:40.560 --> 03:47.280
fucking claws. I think I'm like so into the Olinguito right now. Travis, let me know what

03:47.280 --> 03:54.000
you think. Cause I think it's, uh, fully. Oh Jesus. Oh Christ. You're scared? Sounds like

03:54.000 --> 03:59.280
Travis on my side. Look at his eyeballs. Are you kidding me? That's not the face of a teddy. That's

03:59.280 --> 04:02.880
the face of the devil. It's the face of a teddy bear that wants to kill you. Yeah,

04:02.880 --> 04:07.200
it's the face of a teddy bear that goes, I'll leave me alone with the kids. Like in my unproduced

04:07.200 --> 04:12.400
sequel, the child's play cubbies play where a teddy bear comes to life. I hate to be disparaging

04:13.040 --> 04:18.560
against any, any mammal, especially one that like a mammal really needs a few months on the market

04:18.560 --> 04:24.080
for people to like really put the, put the wheels to the road, really test this animal out. But I

04:24.080 --> 04:29.440
think this Olinguito has got a butter face. It does. Could they not have picked one picture where

04:29.440 --> 04:35.040
he wasn't staring dead eyed into the camera? It does make you wonder how we missed it for so long.

04:35.040 --> 04:41.360
He is literally looking directly at the camera and we have two pictures. How'd that happen?

04:41.360 --> 04:46.240
They said it was hiding in plain sight and you know what? Science, what are we fucking paying

04:46.240 --> 04:50.640
you guys for? Somebody opened like their bread cabinet and it was like, oh shit. Honey, did you

04:50.640 --> 04:55.840
remember to feed the Olinguito today? Uh, no, let me just, have we fucking filed this dude yet?

04:57.600 --> 05:02.320
Honey, did we put him in the encyclopedia yet? In, in the, in the scientist's defense,

05:02.320 --> 05:10.400
every time you walk past an Olinguito, it says, I'm an eagle. That does. Uh, anyway,

05:10.400 --> 05:13.440
we have lots of people to help and I don't think you're saying the animal's name,

05:13.440 --> 05:18.560
but you make it sound like a delicious Italian pasta dish. Olinguito, it's Spanish. It's it's

05:18.560 --> 05:26.160
cause it's derived from, it's a, it's a smaller version of, uh, of John Leguizamo. What?

05:26.160 --> 05:34.880
Someone is playing, someone's playing guess who with this podcast. And with that,

05:34.880 --> 05:39.280
they just figured out who's drunk. It's a small version of an Olingo. So an Olinguito,

05:39.280 --> 05:43.920
cause Olinguito is the Spanish. Anyway, let's help people. That's why Judge Lansito means the

05:43.920 --> 05:51.920
small judge. Little Lance. Hello. I would watch a cartoon show called Little Judge Lansito.

05:51.920 --> 06:03.520
Hey, it's my buddy, Kaytito. Anyway, I don't know how to seal the deal on the dance floor,

06:03.520 --> 06:07.440
whether or not I'm a terrible dancer is up for debate, but I have a good time when I'm out on

06:07.440 --> 06:12.160
the dance floor by myself or with a buddy. The problem is when I catch a girl's attention and

06:12.160 --> 06:16.960
begin dancing with her, I lose my momentum. Where am I supposed to look while I dance with her?

06:16.960 --> 06:22.640
Do I strike up a conversation? Should I ask her if she wants a drink? I just can't seal the deal.

06:22.640 --> 06:28.720
And after one song, they all leave. It's from Gmail. I can, I can answer one of those questions

06:28.720 --> 06:34.000
real quick and easy. Do not strike up a conversation. No, no. Even if you're the best,

06:34.000 --> 06:38.720
if you're Sabian Glover out on that dance floor, you can't be like, Hey, sup, just stick to the

06:38.720 --> 06:46.480
dancing. I think you from around here. You love this job. That's like the international language

06:46.480 --> 06:52.960
of love is, you know, the salsa. Also don't start singing along and stand in place. Cause I did that

06:52.960 --> 06:58.080
for way too many middle school dances and it does not pay off. Oh my God. That's where like,

06:58.080 --> 07:03.120
I'm realizing that I just realized I don't know how to dance. And so I'm just going to kind of

07:03.120 --> 07:11.600
groove. I'm on this floor. What else can I do to music? I know I'm already wearing my show choir

07:11.600 --> 07:16.720
sequin vest. I wore my show choir sequin vest to homecoming cause it's the most formal piece of

07:16.720 --> 07:22.800
apparel I own. Now, no, I never did that in high school, but in middle school I was, uh, yes, uh,

07:22.800 --> 07:29.600
I was a, uh, what's the opposite of a smooth criminal. I was a, I was a, you're a wet bandit.

07:29.600 --> 07:34.000
I was a wet bandit on the dance floor. I don't think, I think that's, I think that's just a

07:34.000 --> 07:37.360
middle school. I think that's the opposite of a smooth criminal as a middle schooler. I don't

07:37.360 --> 07:42.160
think I was a middle schooler out there. You guys, nobody had play. I think do you know that,

07:42.160 --> 07:48.480
um, Michael, they just, uh, discovered that Michael Jackson had a patent on special shoes

07:48.480 --> 07:55.520
with a, uh, a small hook in them that he would hook onto pegs, uh, extending up from the dance

07:55.520 --> 08:02.080
floor that he would use to do his patented smooth criminal lean. He has a patent, literally his

08:02.080 --> 08:08.480
patented smooth criminal lean. He has a patent on it. There's a patent to Mr. Michael Jackson.

08:08.480 --> 08:14.880
I want to lean out. I have this way of leaning. Sure. Hand me my stamp doing Ben Franklin Proud.

08:15.600 --> 08:19.120
The problem is, is after that, anytime anyone leans, they owe Michael Jackson $20.

08:20.240 --> 08:24.880
Hey, what are you reading? Careful. Fuck. I'll hand you the book and you can see.

08:24.880 --> 08:31.280
You just don't bend over. Uh, I, I think a good thing to do is to look at the person,

08:31.280 --> 08:36.560
but maybe not in their eyes, but not at their, their body, necessarily any features of their

08:36.560 --> 08:40.960
body. Look at their left ear. Just sort of like you're appreciating their dancing. Like you're

08:40.960 --> 08:46.720
nodding like, yeah, that's, these are good dances. Maybe look at their hair with like a slightly

08:46.720 --> 08:52.640
disgusted look on your face. No, don't do that. Like look like a nod, like you are dancing.

08:52.640 --> 08:56.000
Cause I think that's all anybody really wants is they want to know that they're dancing.

08:56.720 --> 08:59.680
And then when the song finishes, that's when you capitalize and say like,

08:59.680 --> 09:03.520
Hey, do you want a drink or something? Like you don't do it mid song.

09:03.520 --> 09:09.440
Unless it's the fucking, that's the problem with a great DJ is cause if he keeps dropping jams,

09:09.440 --> 09:14.000
I'll be out there all night. What if every song he plays, I raised my hands to the ceiling. I'm

09:14.000 --> 09:18.480
like, this is my jam. Listen, if he's a good DJ, he'll throw a clunker in there every four songs

09:18.480 --> 09:23.280
so someone can get some. And then he sees a love connection, connection happening. He's like,

09:23.280 --> 09:27.680
I'm going to toss on a long play track. I'm going to toss on the Decemberist five

09:27.680 --> 09:32.800
part C shanty ballad, the Tain, which lasts for 19 minutes. These kids are gonna love this shit.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.840
And they're going to be out there long enough to like find out everything about each other.

09:36.960 --> 09:44.560
Daniel, did you fire that DJ? No. What do you do this time? You're not going to believe it.

09:44.560 --> 09:48.960
He played the Tain. Oh man. Did he cut out the verse with the creepy little woman singing?

09:48.960 --> 09:54.160
Now I left that verse in four and a half minutes, four and a half minutes about cholera. Shit.

09:54.160 --> 09:59.680
I love the accordion solo. Did you really? Yeah. I really got the people fucking going.

09:59.680 --> 10:04.560
He just lifts up one cup of his earphones. I can't stop it. It's a cycle. It's a song cycle.

10:04.560 --> 10:09.120
If I stop it at part four, you're not going to get to the part where the sailor redeems himself.

10:09.120 --> 10:12.000
And you'll feel empty inside all night. Do you want that?

10:12.000 --> 10:14.160
You're not going to get it. If you're at a club, you're feeling

10:14.160 --> 10:18.880
empty inside all night anyway. A lot of times people are just there to dance. You got to

10:18.880 --> 10:23.680
remember that. And I think that that's a sacred exchange. You're going to have to know from the

10:23.680 --> 10:28.800
dancing. I think don't you think you get a good idea from the dancing what the opposite party is

10:28.800 --> 10:32.560
there to do? I don't think of it. It's like a matchmaking thing. I think of it like every time

10:32.560 --> 10:37.840
people dance at a wedding or at a club, they are doing it so that they can go home confident in

10:37.840 --> 10:43.280
the fact that they just dance. I completely agree. I think that I think that you should walk away,

10:43.280 --> 10:48.480
just be like, hey, I dance with a stranger. That's a huge win. That's what I think you're actually.

10:48.480 --> 10:52.960
I think some of the hangup that you might be having is you're the question you've got in

10:52.960 --> 11:01.040
your mind is how do I transition this dance into like a relationship? And maybe you should just

11:01.040 --> 11:07.680
transition it into a dance, like another dance. Well, that's kind of why twerking was invented,

11:07.680 --> 11:11.200
wasn't it? Cause it kind of cuts out all the confusion. It cuts out the middleman.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.640
Guys, hold on one second.

11:12.640 --> 11:18.800
Travis has to go twerk. He has this tick where he can't hear the word twerk.

11:18.800 --> 11:25.120
If I don't twerk on every doorknob in this house, the devil's going to come in.

11:27.280 --> 11:27.920
Sorry, go on.

11:28.960 --> 11:31.200
How, what are you? Are you okay?

11:31.200 --> 11:34.080
Yeah. I just had to kill like the fucking biggest bug that was running across my.

11:34.080 --> 11:40.400
Yeah, yeah, sure. Did you kill him with your butt in like a rhythmic up and down manner?

11:40.400 --> 11:44.720
Did you put on some Miley Cyrus's new songs and then just like go to town on that bug?

11:44.720 --> 11:51.440
I did. Okay. And then we parted as friends and another word was not said between us.

11:52.560 --> 11:56.720
Yeah. Focus on the dancing rather than the relationship building. I think you're going

11:56.720 --> 12:00.320
to have a much better time. If something's going to happen, it'll happen, but maybe just

12:00.320 --> 12:04.080
focus on the dance. Just have fun. Just don't worry about relationship.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.000
I'm going to put some whiskey in this, I think.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.440
How about a Yahoo?

12:08.240 --> 12:10.480
Yes. Oh no, that was awful.

12:10.480 --> 12:10.980
Yeah.

12:14.560 --> 12:20.160
This Yahoo was sent in by Megan. Thank you, Megan. It's by Jack S. who asks,

12:21.920 --> 12:24.320
I'm finally rich. Now what?

12:27.200 --> 12:33.040
I've spent all this time working 80 hour work weeks. Is that fucking possible?

12:33.040 --> 12:34.800
Yeah. Yeah, dog. Trust me. It is.

12:34.800 --> 12:39.920
It is. Sydney works those sometimes too. Used to when she was an intern, not so much anymore.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.880
I just want to hear from her folks, I work as hard as a doctor.

12:46.960 --> 12:50.480
I think Justin quote, Travis works as hard as a doctor.

12:50.480 --> 12:53.520
I've spent all this time working 80 hour work weeks,

12:53.520 --> 12:57.200
dealing with coworkers and bosses I despise. And now I finally made my personal goal.

12:58.400 --> 13:03.520
What the heck do I do now? I'm already set to tell my boss off, but what comes after?

13:03.520 --> 13:07.600
I have no friends. I wanted a relationship, but they never understood that I wanted to

13:07.600 --> 13:13.040
get work out of the way while I was still young and physically able to enjoy life.

13:13.040 --> 13:16.560
Now I'm alone and I don't know what I want. I'm not a mean guy. I've just

13:17.440 --> 13:21.360
found it hard to be in social situations. What do people usually want?

13:21.360 --> 13:26.000
I've never done a lot of things, never even played a video game. Any suggestions?

13:26.000 --> 13:30.080
And how can I get back to dating through new friends? The idea of speed dating terrifies

13:30.080 --> 13:34.560
me bt dubs. So none of that, please. Coming soon from Bradley Cooper.

13:35.120 --> 13:39.440
Hi, I'm Bradley Cooper. This sounds like such a setup for a movie of like,

13:39.440 --> 13:45.280
he worked so hard. He had no time for a family. I'm rich. This is like 8,000 movies.

13:45.280 --> 13:50.320
I'm rich and super humble and I have a very good face. What's up? What do I do now?

13:50.320 --> 13:54.800
My penis is super great. I've heard lots of great things about my super great penis.

13:54.800 --> 14:02.560
I have a Jay Leno-esque amount of cars. What to do? Got a totally open cow.

14:02.560 --> 14:08.960
Got a private plane. Stumpers. Can I get one of those books from the library that's like

14:08.960 --> 14:12.320
30 things to do on a rainy day? Can't open a lemonade stand.

14:14.400 --> 14:17.760
Tricky, tricky. I already got lemonade out of the way.

14:17.760 --> 14:23.200
I already did lemonade. That's how I started. That's how I got rich. I invented lemonade.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.200
Nothing left to do but drown myself, I guess.

14:29.920 --> 14:33.520
If it weren't for the fact that I've been robbing the world with this cool penis, I'd do it.

14:33.520 --> 14:35.120
Stupid, buoyant penis.

14:37.360 --> 14:42.400
It floats to the top of the lake like one of those keychains you put on your-

14:42.400 --> 14:43.360
On like keys?

14:43.360 --> 14:44.160
That floats.

14:46.080 --> 14:46.880
Great metaphor.

14:46.880 --> 14:48.880
What's this fucking guy gonna do?

14:50.160 --> 14:51.440
Maybe play a video game.

14:51.440 --> 14:54.960
It sounds like he's got a very specific goal in life.

14:54.960 --> 14:58.320
Listen, sir. Sir, hi, it's me, Justin, here.

14:58.880 --> 15:02.880
If you want to get back in the dating scene, I have a great step one for you.

15:03.520 --> 15:09.040
Don't get into video games because those two, that's not a path to one.

15:09.040 --> 15:12.000
The path of one is not a path to the other.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.640
These are two very different paths you're staring down the barrel of.

15:15.680 --> 15:21.360
I do, however, I really like the philosophy that he's looking at the world and I got work

15:21.360 --> 15:24.400
out of the way and I didn't know you could do that.

15:24.400 --> 15:25.760
I did the work thing.

15:25.760 --> 15:27.840
I didn't know you could compress it all.

15:27.840 --> 15:35.120
Like instead of working like 30 years of 40 hour weeks, you can just do like 10 of 80.

15:35.120 --> 15:38.800
It's the fucking Minkus career plan, isn't it?

15:38.800 --> 15:43.760
Or it's like you graduate high school by the time you're 10 and it's like now I can just

15:43.760 --> 15:49.360
fucking lamp for five years until it's time for freshman year, travel to Europe, see some shit,

15:49.360 --> 15:51.840
go to Antigua.

15:51.840 --> 15:56.000
And I think traveling is the only thing you can do or maybe be a private eye.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.160
Or maybe travel the world using your great riches to like solve crimes.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.280
I feel like that'd be pretty rewarding.

16:04.240 --> 16:06.560
Or ooh, Thomas crown it.

16:07.280 --> 16:07.840
What's that mean?

16:08.800 --> 16:11.760
So rich, so rich, needs a thrill.

16:11.760 --> 16:15.520
Yeah, he doesn't feel anything anymore unless he has sex with Renee Russo.

16:15.520 --> 16:20.960
Yeah, I don't want to pay for like, you have to be so, I don't think this guy is like Bruce

16:20.960 --> 16:21.840
Wayne wealthy.

16:21.840 --> 16:23.840
I think he just doesn't have to sweat the money.

16:23.840 --> 16:24.320
No, no, no.

16:24.320 --> 16:25.840
Yeah, I think he's probably got-

16:25.840 --> 16:28.960
He's rich enough that he has work out of the way.

16:28.960 --> 16:35.120
Right, but if you live a conservative self-sustaining lifestyle, you can knock that out in like 250

16:35.120 --> 16:36.000
large.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.120
He has basically skipped to being an 80 year old man.

16:39.120 --> 16:39.680
Yeah.

16:39.680 --> 16:44.240
If someone comes to sell in magazines, he's going to tell him he's on a fixed budget.

16:44.240 --> 16:48.080
I mean, that's the life that this guy has painted for himself.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.520
I mean, you work 80 hours at Arby's long enough.

16:52.400 --> 16:56.240
You will have amassed a surprising amount of wealth in beef.

16:57.120 --> 16:59.120
They're not going to pay overtime at Arby's.

16:59.120 --> 16:59.920
They're not going to let anybody work-

16:59.920 --> 17:01.840
No, there's no way they're going to get approval.

17:01.840 --> 17:03.360
Yeah, I guess that's true.

17:03.360 --> 17:07.440
They got to reach out to Mr. Arby and be like, hey, can we work Timmy longer?

17:07.440 --> 17:07.760
No.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.760
I really don't know what you would do.

17:09.760 --> 17:12.000
I mean, you got the-

17:12.000 --> 17:12.560
Swim in it.

17:12.560 --> 17:13.280
Thing out of the way.

17:13.280 --> 17:20.080
I would probably read a lot or say I'm going to read a lot and probably play video games.

17:20.080 --> 17:26.640
Swimming in it is like, there's nothing grosser you could fill a pool with.

17:26.640 --> 17:35.840
I'll go ahead and say, if it was human excrement, you would at least know who it had been processed

17:35.840 --> 17:36.320
by.

17:36.320 --> 17:37.920
You would at least know the source.

17:37.920 --> 17:41.440
Money is like a hundred different people's germs.

17:41.440 --> 17:45.520
I'm going to jump back to say that you think poop is better when you know who it comes from.

17:46.560 --> 17:49.120
That's never been a consolation to me.

17:50.480 --> 17:51.920
Oh, this is Steve's?

17:51.920 --> 17:53.120
Steve's poop?

17:53.120 --> 17:53.440
No problem.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.800
That guy eats right.

17:54.800 --> 17:55.680
He seems clean.

17:55.680 --> 17:57.040
He eats a lot of kale.

17:57.040 --> 17:58.240
I see what he eats.

17:58.240 --> 17:59.600
He's treating himself good.

17:59.600 --> 18:00.480
All right.

18:00.480 --> 18:10.320
This is either, this question is either a perfectly concentrated story of how wealth is meaningless

18:10.320 --> 18:18.960
and how true happiness is found in love and from everyone else, or it's a story about

18:18.960 --> 18:24.480
how wealth is the only important thing and then once you get that, everything else is

18:24.480 --> 18:25.920
pretty much bullshit.

18:25.920 --> 18:27.520
May I also throw this out?

18:28.080 --> 18:34.240
Is it possible that this is written by like a 24 year old kid who has like $30,000 in

18:34.240 --> 18:34.960
the bank?

18:34.960 --> 18:37.040
That's a fucking shit.

18:37.040 --> 18:37.840
How old is the kid?

18:37.840 --> 18:40.240
He's like 24.

18:40.240 --> 18:45.040
That's, you may as well have just said he has infinity dollars in his super bank.

18:45.040 --> 18:45.680
That's what I'm saying.

18:45.680 --> 18:46.960
And he goes, I'm rich.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.800
He fucking is in this economy.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.560
Think of how many peabers that could buy him.

18:54.560 --> 18:55.920
Here's the reason I think that.

18:55.920 --> 19:00.480
It's from the context clues of saying that he's ready to like tell off his boss.

19:00.480 --> 19:01.120
Yeah.

19:01.120 --> 19:06.640
Like no 40 year old responsible man with 250 mil in the bank is like, fuck my boss.

19:06.640 --> 19:10.400
I'm gonna tell JP Wentworth where to stick it.

19:12.320 --> 19:15.280
I got your cat instruction, cat settlement right here.

19:15.280 --> 19:21.920
When I was in my mid twenties, I got my first full time job at the, I mean it was my first

19:21.920 --> 19:22.400
full time job.

19:22.400 --> 19:27.040
It was my first salaried position at the Ironson Tribune.

19:27.840 --> 19:35.360
My starting salary was $19,000 and I remember looking at that number thinking, how am I

19:35.360 --> 19:39.920
going to spend $19,000?

19:42.640 --> 19:47.920
And you realize that it was the answer to that question was you will spend it as if

19:47.920 --> 19:49.200
your life depends on it.

19:50.080 --> 19:50.320
Right.

19:50.320 --> 19:54.080
Because it very, very, very much does.

19:54.080 --> 19:56.880
You will spend it instantly is the answer.

19:56.880 --> 19:57.120
Right.

19:57.120 --> 20:06.800
Right, we have a very special guest question from a celebrity guest question, which we

20:06.800 --> 20:07.360
do.

20:07.360 --> 20:08.320
Well, never.

20:08.320 --> 20:15.440
We did it pretty regularly, basically from a friend of the show.

20:16.800 --> 20:20.240
I guess Jeff Kanata, he had to have that, I guess, huh?

20:21.200 --> 20:23.440
Well, I mean, I guess he's a friend of the show.

20:23.440 --> 20:25.520
I mean, now he's a friend of the show.

20:25.520 --> 20:32.320
Certainly our friend, my dear friend and soon to be yours, I'm sure Jeff Kanata, formerly

20:32.320 --> 20:37.840
of Totally Right Show, soon to be of newest, latest, best, his upcoming program that I

20:37.840 --> 20:39.040
think everybody's looking forward to.

20:39.600 --> 20:43.440
And he's got a question for us and I want to share it with you right now.

20:44.080 --> 20:46.880
Hello, Justin, Travis and Griffin.

20:47.760 --> 20:50.160
I come to you because I love your show.

20:50.160 --> 20:57.520
I value your advice and because Justin generously contributed cash money to my Kickstarter

20:57.520 --> 20:58.240
campaign.

20:58.240 --> 21:00.400
Let's be honest, it's mostly that third one.

21:01.360 --> 21:07.440
But I come to you at a giant crossroads in my life for some major, major advice.

21:08.720 --> 21:11.040
As you may know, I love loving things.

21:11.040 --> 21:12.240
I love loving love.

21:12.240 --> 21:17.920
I love love and I love women, but there is one particular woman I am in love with.

21:17.920 --> 21:19.600
And I want to ask her to marry me.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.440
Luckily, she doesn't listen to the internets.

21:23.440 --> 21:27.680
She's not aware of it having audio yet.

21:27.680 --> 21:36.240
So don't tell her, but tell me how should I do it as guys in various states of married

21:36.240 --> 21:37.760
and unmarried status?

21:39.760 --> 21:41.120
How should I do it?

21:41.120 --> 21:49.760
How should I do it, what will guarantee her having said yes and my eventual happiness

21:50.800 --> 21:51.760
and marital bliss?

21:52.400 --> 21:54.160
I look forward to hearing your question.

21:54.160 --> 21:55.040
I'll take it off the air.

21:55.680 --> 21:57.280
Long time listener, first time caller.

21:57.280 --> 21:58.720
Jeff, it's a fine question.

21:58.720 --> 22:00.640
It's one we've all dealt with.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.480
By we all, I mean the three of us.

22:03.040 --> 22:08.000
No, I think everybody at some point in their life has proposed some.

22:08.000 --> 22:13.840
And the answer, Jeff, is as big and showy and flashy as possible.

22:13.840 --> 22:20.960
Go on YouTube and search wedding proposal, must see, like, like, share, subscribe with

22:20.960 --> 22:25.600
friends and then see which one has the most hits and then try and recreate it.

22:25.600 --> 22:30.880
Now, I know you're wondering, how am I going to get 50 people into Disney World on a budget?

22:31.760 --> 22:33.120
And the answer is smuggling.

22:33.120 --> 22:38.480
You've got to track down the guy in the Jeremy the Jackal suit, which is everyone's favorite

22:38.480 --> 22:40.800
Disney character, and then use him.

22:40.800 --> 22:42.880
He was the bully in the Goofy movie, you guys.

22:42.880 --> 22:43.600
Yeah.

22:43.600 --> 22:46.640
He's in Bedknobs and Roof Sticks too, he's still novel.

22:46.640 --> 22:54.720
You get him and you get, it's going to cost you quite a few Disney pesos, which are only

22:54.720 --> 22:56.000
usable in Epcot.

22:56.960 --> 23:01.360
And you're going to get 50 people in there, you're going to do a little, what they call

23:01.360 --> 23:03.040
a flash mob.

23:03.040 --> 23:04.560
Pick a Bruno Mars song at random.

23:04.560 --> 23:07.280
Pick any, but throw a dart at a Bruno Mars CD.

23:07.280 --> 23:11.200
Now throw that CD away and get a working one because you fucked that one up.

23:11.200 --> 23:13.840
Throw a dart at Bruno Mars and call your lawyer.

23:13.840 --> 23:16.400
If you hit him, it's six more weeks of winter.

23:20.160 --> 23:24.560
There's got to be a better, we have to develop some sort of meteorological technology.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.040
Just let Bruno Mars make his mediocre music.

23:29.040 --> 23:30.400
Hey, fuck off.

23:30.400 --> 23:31.360
Who the fuck are you?

23:32.000 --> 23:33.040
Highly danceable.

23:35.680 --> 23:36.960
That is Ted danceable.

23:40.720 --> 23:41.840
That's not a thing.

23:41.840 --> 23:42.560
Ted danceable?

23:42.560 --> 23:43.600
Yeah, everyone says that.

23:44.320 --> 23:48.240
Don't do any of the things that we've said so far for the past three and a half years.

23:48.880 --> 23:59.120
You, honestly, I don't think there's a person alive that wants, that has ever received a

23:59.120 --> 24:03.200
proposal and gone like, that wasn't, there weren't nearly enough people watching.

24:04.160 --> 24:05.520
It's got to be intimate, right?

24:05.520 --> 24:13.520
It's got to be like, it's got to be like, I don't know, 15, 20 people tops watching you.

24:14.240 --> 24:18.640
So you got to charge, you got to charge for admission and really capitalize on this.

24:18.640 --> 24:21.760
A lot of that depends though on how likely you think she is to say yes.

24:22.320 --> 24:27.520
Because if you're the man or woman in your life, you're going to propose to them,

24:27.520 --> 24:33.360
and you are worried that maybe they may be hesitant.

24:33.360 --> 24:36.240
If you put them on blast like that with 30 to 40 people,

24:37.040 --> 24:41.680
then I think that they're not going to, and there's social pressure at that point.

24:41.680 --> 24:42.080
Yeah.

24:42.080 --> 24:46.480
Ooh, ooh, wait till you have a big public fight and then pull out the ring.

24:47.600 --> 24:47.840
Why?

24:48.880 --> 24:52.240
Because it's really going to cancel out all of like the fight that just happened.

24:52.240 --> 24:56.160
You're saying wait for like, wait till you fuck up.

24:56.160 --> 24:56.400
Yeah.

24:56.400 --> 24:57.360
Like really bad.

24:57.360 --> 24:57.840
Yeah.

24:57.840 --> 25:02.880
And like get into it and just express all your anger in the situation.

25:02.880 --> 25:06.160
But then boom, engagement ring, right?

25:06.160 --> 25:10.080
Because then it's like all that time that just happened before that didn't happen,

25:10.080 --> 25:12.800
didn't exist because it's wedding time.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.720
God, women are so fucking dumb.

25:14.720 --> 25:16.400
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

25:16.400 --> 25:18.560
No, hey, hey, hey, shut up.

25:18.560 --> 25:21.040
I want to say that women could pull that move on a dude too.

25:21.040 --> 25:21.440
Look at this.

25:21.440 --> 25:24.080
I want to say women and men both get proposed to.

25:24.080 --> 25:30.480
It's 2013 and I'm saying people getting proposed to are dumb, not women.

25:30.480 --> 25:33.040
I'm judging all of humanity, Griffin.

25:33.040 --> 25:34.640
I hate everyone.

25:34.640 --> 25:41.520
There is just like a three in a row chain of us putting each other up last.

25:43.200 --> 25:46.880
There's just like, hey, that thing you said was insensitive and then pointing that out,

25:46.880 --> 25:49.840
I'm going to say a somewhat insensitive thing like, oh shit.

25:49.840 --> 25:54.400
Insensitive, insensitivity oraburus.

25:54.400 --> 25:58.560
This is an insensitive snake eating its own tail.

25:59.360 --> 26:01.360
Jeff, privacy of your own home.

26:02.560 --> 26:08.880
Just think about it's got to, when I was going to propose to Rachel and I was trying to think

26:08.880 --> 26:14.560
of the way to do it for a while, my fucking plan, she was out of town and I was going to do it

26:14.560 --> 26:18.080
the night she got back from her business trip.

26:18.080 --> 26:22.000
And she got back, when she got back, I was going to pick her up in the airport in a limo

26:22.000 --> 26:23.280
and then like do it there.

26:23.280 --> 26:24.880
And it's going to be romantic with champagne.

26:24.880 --> 26:27.760
We're going to play her favorite Bruno Mars song on the CD player.

26:27.760 --> 26:30.560
And Bruno Mars would be driving.

26:30.560 --> 26:35.040
The limo driver would actually be that great guy who drives the limo in How I Met Her Mother.

26:35.040 --> 26:36.320
And it was going to be perfect.

26:36.320 --> 26:40.960
And then I remembered like, I've never been in a fucking limo in my whole goddamn life.

26:40.960 --> 26:44.320
And I don't want like some stranger that I paid to be there like,

26:44.320 --> 26:49.440
like getting his jimmies off in the front seat while I profess my eternal love.

26:49.440 --> 26:50.000
You know what I mean?

26:50.000 --> 26:51.440
Did you say getting his jiggies off?

26:52.320 --> 26:56.160
Getting his Jigglypuffs off in the front seat while I'm doing my stuff.

26:57.440 --> 26:58.400
No, I agree.

26:58.400 --> 27:02.640
And the point Griffin's trying to get to in a roundabout time-killing way.

27:02.640 --> 27:05.200
Don't let your driver masturbate in the front seat.

27:05.200 --> 27:06.480
Don't let anybody masturbate.

27:06.480 --> 27:10.560
If there's someone masturbating at your proposal, you dumb fucked up somewhere.

27:12.240 --> 27:14.080
Let me go back over the plan.

27:14.080 --> 27:15.200
Pick her up in the limo.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.000
Yeah, I did that.

27:16.000 --> 27:16.880
Get her at the airport.

27:17.600 --> 27:18.640
Let driver masturbate.

27:18.640 --> 27:19.840
Write it down, number three.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.600
Pay driver extra to masturbate.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.120
Let me just scratch that off the list.

27:23.680 --> 27:30.160
I think you actually need, you need to consider the person and what they want.

27:30.160 --> 27:31.680
There's not a blanket answer we can give you.

27:32.560 --> 27:34.320
Maybe they don't want to masturbate in the front seat.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.880
It would mean a lot to Sydney to have friends and family around.

27:36.880 --> 27:39.760
So I did it at New Year's when there was a bunch of people there.

27:40.320 --> 27:43.440
Yeah, honestly with Teresa, like both of our schedules are so hectic,

27:43.440 --> 27:45.360
but we just desperately wanted to be engaged.

27:45.360 --> 27:47.120
So it was a very casual thing.

27:47.680 --> 27:49.600
Like, hey, I got you flowers and I love you.

27:49.600 --> 27:52.160
And let's do this wedding thing we've been talking about for four years.

27:53.120 --> 27:55.040
And you can probably, I don't know who you are.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.200
You could probably do better than let's do this wedding thing.

27:57.840 --> 27:59.920
No, I got down on one knee and I did a whole thing.

27:59.920 --> 28:02.480
But like, we're both wicked busy right now.

28:02.480 --> 28:05.920
Let's just, let's just, I don't know about you, but let's take a wedding nap.

28:05.920 --> 28:08.800
Listen, you're my sun and my moon or whatever.

28:08.800 --> 28:10.560
What the shit ever.

28:10.560 --> 28:12.160
And man, I don't know.

28:12.160 --> 28:13.760
Let's do this wedding thing.

28:16.000 --> 28:16.880
Fuck it.

28:16.880 --> 28:18.080
You're the moon of my moon.

28:19.120 --> 28:20.720
Son of my stars or something.

28:20.720 --> 28:21.120
I don't know.

28:21.120 --> 28:26.240
I don't watch Game of Thrones that closely, but you're something or whatever.

28:26.240 --> 28:26.800
Marriage.

28:28.720 --> 28:30.080
Let's do this.

28:30.080 --> 28:30.800
Let's do this.

28:30.800 --> 28:31.920
Let's do this wedding thing.

28:31.920 --> 28:45.760
Uh, let's do this fucking money thing and get paid.

28:45.760 --> 28:50.240
I know you're especially afraid to say I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

28:50.240 --> 28:51.360
Ring on a dildo.

28:51.360 --> 28:53.040
A ring on a dildo, Travis.

28:53.040 --> 28:53.680
That's exact.

28:53.680 --> 28:56.480
You took the words clean out of my mouth.

28:56.480 --> 28:56.800
Okay.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.640
Hey diddle diddle, put a dildo in the middle.

28:58.640 --> 28:58.960
Okay.

28:58.960 --> 29:03.200
There were like 10 words that I hated in the past minute.

29:04.560 --> 29:09.200
Griffin may hate masturbation toys, but I am deep, deep into them.

29:09.200 --> 29:11.600
You're like a sex flesh pussies broker.

29:11.600 --> 29:14.320
Would you say that they're deep, deep into you?

29:15.840 --> 29:19.680
You can get deep, deep into a firm pussy and ass masturbator.

29:19.680 --> 29:21.280
That's not me being vulgar.

29:21.280 --> 29:22.720
That's a product name.

29:22.720 --> 29:23.760
That's trademark.

29:23.760 --> 29:24.800
Copyright.

29:24.800 --> 29:25.840
Trademark.

29:25.840 --> 29:29.040
Firm pussy, firm pussy.

29:31.040 --> 29:39.760
Extremershace.com is your home for all of this delicious, delicious sexual paraphernalia.

29:40.400 --> 29:44.880
It doesn't matter if it looks like a creature from labyrinth, get it and fuck it.

29:44.880 --> 29:45.840
Which one?

29:45.840 --> 29:49.040
It doesn't matter if it looks like David Bowie, put your dick in it.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.080
Now hold on, who's that?

29:50.080 --> 29:53.600
You could probably get David Bowie's butthole as a sex toy, I bet.

29:53.600 --> 30:00.640
You can get an exact replica of Sasha Gray's, and this is a direct quote from their website,

30:00.640 --> 30:02.000
amazing pussy.

30:04.240 --> 30:07.200
It looks like it's singing a Supreme song.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.960
Oh, God.

30:11.680 --> 30:12.800
Fuck, that was sucked.

30:12.800 --> 30:16.800
That would be amazing pussy.

30:16.800 --> 30:22.400
Every porn director in the world just shot up in bed like our career's done.

30:22.400 --> 30:23.760
Our career's over.

30:23.760 --> 30:25.600
Our whole industry is shot now.

30:26.080 --> 30:28.880
Sexuality and sex should know what to do with it.

30:28.880 --> 30:30.400
Children of men too.

30:30.400 --> 30:33.280
You just blast it off an EMP for boners.

30:36.640 --> 30:38.720
It would be an amazing pussy if it sang it.

30:38.720 --> 30:39.920
Yeah, I'm not being credible.

30:39.920 --> 30:40.720
That's some pig.

30:40.720 --> 30:42.720
Feed me some more.

30:43.600 --> 30:44.960
That's what it looks like.

30:44.960 --> 30:49.760
You can feed it some dick and you can do it for 20% off using the code sexopon.

30:49.760 --> 30:51.200

30:51.200 --> 30:52.720
20% off your dick.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.960
Are you going to keep your whole dick?

30:57.520 --> 30:58.720
Go use sexabunga with your whole dick.

30:58.720 --> 30:59.040
You know what?

30:59.040 --> 31:02.160
I say that, but I haven't been over all the product descriptions.

31:02.160 --> 31:02.800
I don't know.

31:03.440 --> 31:06.880
That's not a guarantee that you keep your whole dick with extremerestraints.com, but

31:06.880 --> 31:10.800
you can keep a little bit of that do-re-mi for yourself.

31:10.800 --> 31:13.520
20%, in fact, using the coupon code sexabunga.

31:13.520 --> 31:16.640
It's all waiting for you at extremerestraints.com.

31:16.640 --> 31:23.200
20% is fucking crazy when you think about how much people are saving.

31:23.840 --> 31:30.160
If you buy $500 worth of butt of those beads that you put in your butt, butt beads, that's

31:30.160 --> 31:31.440
$400 you're paying.

31:31.440 --> 31:36.240
That's a whole hundred dollars that you can spend on $100 more butt beads, which will

31:36.240 --> 31:42.880
in turn get you like $118 extra dollars of butt beads.

31:42.880 --> 31:44.080
You could just keep going on this.

31:44.080 --> 31:45.680
It sounds like a pyramid scheme.

31:45.680 --> 31:48.160
Well, no, eventually you're going to get diminishing returns.

31:48.160 --> 31:54.240
Then it's like, Papa, I've got $0.15 worth of butt beads, butt beads, butt beads, $0.15

31:54.240 --> 31:55.920
for a fraction of butt beads.

31:55.920 --> 31:58.640
There's got to be something on this site I can fuck for a quarter.

32:00.800 --> 32:01.760
Oh my god, there is.

32:03.200 --> 32:03.680
There is.

32:04.480 --> 32:06.320
Extremerestraints.com is a website.

32:06.320 --> 32:09.520
They're like the best friends we have in this whole world.

32:09.520 --> 32:10.400
Please be nice to them.

32:10.400 --> 32:11.120
Don't scare them away.

32:11.120 --> 32:12.160
It's the only friends we've got.

32:12.160 --> 32:18.480
Hey, this is Erin and Brian from Throwing Shade, and we would love to throw some shade

32:18.480 --> 32:19.520
on you this summer.

32:19.520 --> 32:24.480
Every Tuesday, we inject all sorts of news stories concerning ladies and gays with silliness

32:24.480 --> 32:26.080
and sexiness.

32:26.080 --> 32:27.760
Just in time for bikini season.

32:27.760 --> 32:30.320
Check us out on Max Fun under Throwing Shade.

32:30.320 --> 32:31.440
Okay, they're not stupid.

32:31.440 --> 32:33.040
I know, but yeah, they could be.

32:33.040 --> 32:34.240
Why would you spell it out like that?

32:34.240 --> 32:36.480
Because I was the spelling bee champion of the world.

32:36.480 --> 32:44.480
Farm wisdom, farm wisdom.

32:44.480 --> 32:46.240
Get your fork, it's not us pork.

32:46.240 --> 32:47.520
Farm wisdom.

32:47.520 --> 32:49.120
I would like Griffin to read the first one, please.

32:51.600 --> 32:52.640
Here's the first one.

32:53.440 --> 32:55.760
I grew up on a racehorse farm.

32:57.280 --> 32:58.800
Oh, the most exciting life.

32:58.800 --> 32:59.760
I grew up on a racehorse farm.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.360
Welcome to the show, Paul Bearer.

33:01.360 --> 33:03.200
The late Paul Bearer who joined us.

33:03.200 --> 33:11.760
When a veterinarian castrates a racehorse, they throw the detached balls up on the roof

33:11.760 --> 33:13.280
of the barn for good luck.

33:13.280 --> 33:14.320
Pretty gross.

33:14.320 --> 33:14.880
Jesse.

33:14.880 --> 33:15.600
Thanks, Jesse.

33:16.480 --> 33:17.600
And I fact checked that.

33:17.600 --> 33:18.800
That's 100% true.

33:18.800 --> 33:20.960
That's an old wives tale.

33:20.960 --> 33:23.200
100%, fuck you.

33:23.200 --> 33:24.240
There's no...

33:24.240 --> 33:27.840
Doesn't horse sperm sell for like 100,000 on...

33:28.640 --> 33:31.440
You castrate a racehorse if it's having behavioral problems.

33:31.440 --> 33:38.720
And then you have to like tell me though, promise me that if you are going to do this

33:38.720 --> 33:43.040
for behavioral problems, you definitely, definitely bring the horse out of the yard.

33:43.040 --> 33:45.040
When you throw its balls on the roof.

33:45.040 --> 33:45.840
Hey, come see this.

33:46.720 --> 33:47.200
What?

33:47.200 --> 33:48.400
How did this old wives tale...

33:48.400 --> 33:50.080
This is what you get for playing in my yard.

33:50.640 --> 33:51.920
Orb, come watch this.

33:51.920 --> 33:53.760
See what's funny to eat my pocket.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.440
Orb, come on.

33:56.880 --> 34:01.120
How did this fucking witchcraft kiss...

34:01.120 --> 34:05.440
I can't imagine there was just a super lazy veterinary, old timey...

34:05.440 --> 34:07.840
You never heard balls on the roof fasten the hoof?

34:10.800 --> 34:14.720
I'm imagining like an 18th century veterinarian.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.240
Like, what do I...

34:16.240 --> 34:17.280
Ah, fuck.

34:17.280 --> 34:18.080
What do I do with these?

34:18.080 --> 34:18.960
They're slippery.

34:18.960 --> 34:25.840
Maybe in the heat of a passionate horse crime, they cut off a horse's balls unwillingly and

34:25.840 --> 34:28.160
then had to dispose of the evidence.

34:28.160 --> 34:31.200
Chinkle, chinkle, that is balls, what do you know?

34:31.200 --> 34:31.760
Oh, fuck.

34:31.760 --> 34:36.720
You got to tie them on the back of your truck so that they hang comically as though they're

34:36.720 --> 34:37.920
the truck's testicles.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.720
It's very comical.

34:40.720 --> 34:41.840
Is that the implication?

34:42.480 --> 34:43.600
I believe so.

34:43.600 --> 34:47.840
I'm going to go back when I'm editing the podcast and find the minute mark where Travis

34:47.840 --> 34:52.160
said he was going to start adding whiskey to his beverage and then time it out to now.

34:52.720 --> 34:55.440
And then we'll know like the porousness of his liver.

34:55.440 --> 34:58.160
What's the other farm wisdom?

34:58.160 --> 35:00.240
Chickens play dead and fart through their mouths.

35:02.880 --> 35:04.320
It's the best Smith's album.

35:04.320 --> 35:06.960
I don't care what anybody says, it is the best.

35:08.640 --> 35:12.720
I don't want to get gross, but if we're talking about like just physiological stuff, don't

35:12.720 --> 35:13.440
human beings...

35:13.440 --> 35:19.680
I have heard things come out of Travis's mouth that I'm like 100% certain was a fart.

35:20.560 --> 35:22.240
Like, undoubtedly.

35:22.240 --> 35:26.800
I know you have dyspepsia and it's a thing you struggle with every day, but I'm saying

35:26.800 --> 35:29.280
that your shit's backwards.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.760
Do you think chickens play dead because they wish they were dead?

35:33.760 --> 35:35.200
Because they've been farting out their mouths?

35:36.320 --> 35:38.560
Or do you think they play dead when someone's like, you smell that?

35:39.920 --> 35:41.040
Can't be that dead chicken.

35:43.040 --> 35:43.840
You know he's innocent.

35:43.840 --> 35:45.440
Smells like a mouth fart.

35:46.160 --> 35:46.960
Couldn't be that guy.

35:48.000 --> 35:48.720
Oh, God, oh, God.

35:48.720 --> 35:50.320
He looks like he's been dead for weeks.

35:50.320 --> 35:52.320
Just go, go, go, go, go, go.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.360
I don't want to, I don't want to do it.

35:55.360 --> 35:56.400
It's going to taste so bad.

35:57.040 --> 35:57.920
Oh, God.

35:57.920 --> 35:59.040
I'm just going to pretend I'm dead.

36:00.080 --> 36:03.440
I'd like to see a new version of Charlotte's Web.

36:04.480 --> 36:09.440
Maybe the stage production where Charlotte's like, Wilbur, I have to make this, I have

36:09.440 --> 36:10.320
to make this web.

36:10.880 --> 36:12.720
Singing your praises so they keep you alive.

36:12.720 --> 36:14.480
And then chuckles, the chicken comes on, he's like,

36:14.480 --> 36:29.040
BLEH, BLEH, BLEH, KILL ME, BLEH, BLEH, BLEH, BLEH, BLEH, BLEH, BLEH, BLEH.

36:29.040 --> 36:32.880
I was going to take this pig to the county fair, but I got a chicken.

36:32.880 --> 36:35.120
The mouth farts the alphabet.

36:36.160 --> 36:39.840
I mean, he's famous, but doesn't seem like much of a life.

36:39.840 --> 36:43.360
Hey, I keep finding random sex toys in my yard.

36:43.360 --> 36:48.400
I live on a busy street, and over the past year, my wife and I have found multiple simulated

36:48.400 --> 36:56.000
penises of varying sizes and styles strewn throughout our yard, some making it as far

36:56.000 --> 37:01.200
as our backyard, which is approximately 30 feet from the road.

37:02.720 --> 37:07.120
Drew Brees is disposing of sex toys in your house.

37:07.120 --> 37:15.760
Is this some new tradition that high schoolers are participating in, like finding porn in

37:15.760 --> 37:20.320
the woods, or do I just live in a very kinky neighborhood that's from extremely restrained

37:20.320 --> 37:20.800
interaction?

37:20.800 --> 37:21.760
Do you know what it is?

37:23.280 --> 37:25.760
It's the daily delivery from the Gaper Boy.

37:29.280 --> 37:30.400
Arcade classic.

37:30.400 --> 37:36.720
Arcade classic, Gaper Boy thrown in jail for breaking too many windows with giant tics.

37:38.480 --> 37:41.360
I would just like to see you come out on your lawn and see another one.

37:41.360 --> 37:44.480
You look up, and you just have that neighbor across the street sipping his coffee with

37:44.480 --> 37:45.200
his open robe.

37:45.840 --> 37:46.800
He's going, what's up?

37:46.800 --> 37:47.360
What's up?

37:48.560 --> 37:49.440
Check your backyard.

37:51.200 --> 37:52.320
Some treats back there.

37:52.320 --> 37:54.720
The worst Easter egg hunt ever.

37:54.720 --> 37:57.600
He just keeps hoping one of them will find purchase in your soil.

37:58.400 --> 37:58.960
Blossom.

37:58.960 --> 37:59.520
He'll know.

37:59.520 --> 38:00.020
He'll know.

38:03.200 --> 38:04.480
Yeah, I mean, this sounds...

38:06.000 --> 38:07.680
So we started with tee peeing, right?

38:07.680 --> 38:12.560
And then tee peeing ended up being way too easy to clean up, so then teens started forking.

38:13.360 --> 38:20.880
And then I guess that the sort of like physical toll that forking takes on you was no longer

38:20.880 --> 38:24.320
enough, and so they have now just started putting dicks in the yard.

38:24.320 --> 38:29.440
And it's not hard to pick a dick up and like throw it away or wash it off in the dishwasher,

38:29.440 --> 38:33.760
and then put it in your secret drawer, in your vegetable taxes box.

38:33.760 --> 38:38.800
But, you know, it takes a lot out of your mind when you don't know where it came from.

38:39.680 --> 38:40.160
You know what I mean?

38:40.160 --> 38:41.280
I'm a little confused.

38:41.280 --> 38:44.400
Like, I don't get the implication of the prank.

38:44.400 --> 38:46.560
Like, I put this on your yard.

38:46.560 --> 38:47.200
Like, that's it?

38:47.760 --> 38:48.640
Like, that's the...

38:48.640 --> 38:51.440
Yeah, but then they have to touch it, right?

38:51.440 --> 38:53.440
It's like a strange dick.

38:53.440 --> 38:54.080
And they have to...

38:54.960 --> 38:56.240
It's definitely a prank, though.

38:56.240 --> 38:58.720
We didn't agree on that, because there's no way that this is just like,

38:58.720 --> 39:02.560
I just live in a neighborhood where people are just throwing dildos everywhere.

39:02.560 --> 39:06.800
Is it possible that this is the ninth long overdue biblical plague?

39:08.240 --> 39:09.280
And it's only you.

39:09.280 --> 39:10.720
And it's only happening to you.

39:10.720 --> 39:12.080
It's very concentrated.

39:12.080 --> 39:13.120
You're thinking about a Yahoo.

39:13.120 --> 39:13.360
Sure.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.160
This Yahoo was sent in by Julie Kin.

39:16.160 --> 39:16.800
Thank you, Julie.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.880
Julie's been sending us Yahoo's for a while.

39:18.880 --> 39:20.400
This is her first time on the show.

39:20.400 --> 39:24.720
But I think she works at like a military base, because each of her emails has the word

39:24.720 --> 39:31.680
unclassified attached to it, as if we needed to know, like, this Yahoo about dildos

39:31.680 --> 39:33.600
is not a top secret government secret.

39:34.240 --> 39:35.840
I am not Snowden-ing right now.

39:36.960 --> 39:37.680
Anyway, thank you, Julie.

39:37.680 --> 39:38.240
It's by Yahoo.

39:38.240 --> 39:40.240
Did someone mention schnorder?

39:40.240 --> 39:40.960
Stop it.

39:40.960 --> 39:43.200
It's by Yahoo.

39:43.200 --> 39:46.160
Yahoo answers user AJ Foxweather, who asks,

39:48.800 --> 39:50.080
All you can eat buffet.

39:50.080 --> 39:50.800
Is it worth it?

39:50.800 --> 39:56.240
I just want to dine at a place where you can have pizza and tacos and macaroni and cheese

39:56.240 --> 39:58.080
and spaghetti in one sitting.

39:58.080 --> 40:00.400
But I've never eaten at one of those restaurants before.

40:00.400 --> 40:01.840
Is it worth the price to get in?

40:01.840 --> 40:05.680
I also hear that these places are unsanitary and I don't want to get food sickness.

40:05.680 --> 40:06.240
Thanks.

40:08.240 --> 40:09.680
Ah, food sickness.

40:09.680 --> 40:11.200
Is it worth it?

40:12.240 --> 40:14.000
I think financially, yes.

40:14.000 --> 40:18.880
If we're talking about fiscal, like, I don't think there's, I don't think it could be more

40:18.880 --> 40:19.440
worth it.

40:19.440 --> 40:21.280
Yeah, it's a great fiscal deal.

40:21.280 --> 40:21.780
Right.

40:24.080 --> 40:27.120
The restaurant you're looking at, let's just stop beating around the bush.

40:27.120 --> 40:28.480
They're talking about Golden Corral.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.400
Right, you're not getting all these things in any other place.

40:32.400 --> 40:32.900
Yeah.

40:34.160 --> 40:40.560
Golden Corral, whose original subtitle tagline was pizza and tacos and macaroni and cheese

40:40.560 --> 40:42.560
and spaghetti and fuck it and fuck you.

40:42.560 --> 40:47.920
It is going to be, I don't think that sanitation, I think when you're a chef, right, and you

40:47.920 --> 40:54.720
specialize in raw oysters, you work very hard, or sushi or artisanal pizzas, you work really

40:54.720 --> 40:58.320
hard to, like, keep a clean workstation and, like, get shit done.

40:58.320 --> 41:04.240
When you have to crank out pizza, tacos, mac, cheese and spaghetti in one sitting,

41:05.120 --> 41:07.760
sanitation becomes less of a concern for you.

41:08.480 --> 41:10.320
Well, I think it's a good thing.

41:10.320 --> 41:12.640
It's less of a concern for you.

41:12.640 --> 41:18.160
Well, I think your answer to everything becomes, well, fuck it, they can eat something else.

41:18.160 --> 41:20.960
Like, hey, your tacos are bad and they should eat the pizza.

41:20.960 --> 41:26.880
But here, call me naive, but I would like to think that it has to be at least kind of

41:26.880 --> 41:32.160
sanitary to remain open, or do you think just the authorities turn a blind eye because,

41:32.160 --> 41:32.640
like, you go there.

41:32.640 --> 41:35.040
Listen, they have so much.

41:35.040 --> 41:37.120
Well, if you go there, you're asking for it.

41:37.120 --> 41:38.000
I mean, let's be honest.

41:38.000 --> 41:43.200
I think that Justin had a point wherein that the chefs sort of pick and choose what they

41:43.200 --> 41:46.160
give the appropriate time and cleanliness to.

41:46.160 --> 41:50.320
Like, you will go to the Golden Buffet and be like, let me get some of that roast rump.

41:50.320 --> 41:52.880
And the carver will be like, no, no, keep going.

41:52.880 --> 41:57.680
Because that carver is like a fucking honor guard.

41:57.680 --> 42:02.720
I feel like the carver, I feel like that's where you're going to get your best quality

42:02.720 --> 42:04.800
stuff because you can put a face to it.

42:04.800 --> 42:09.120
If I eat something and it's bad, I go right back to that guy.

42:09.120 --> 42:11.520
I'm like, listen, let's sort this out.

42:12.240 --> 42:14.160
What's the scoop on the mac and cheese?

42:14.160 --> 42:16.640
We call it the cheddar trough.

42:16.640 --> 42:18.000
No, like, what's the story?

42:19.200 --> 42:20.640
What's the story behind it?

42:20.640 --> 42:21.680
You don't want it.

42:21.680 --> 42:23.840
All of this was powder a few minutes ago.

42:26.640 --> 42:29.360
We don't remember making any mac and cheese.

42:29.360 --> 42:31.680
We're not sure what that word two minutes ago.

42:31.680 --> 42:35.440
Yeah, this golden corral is severely haunted.

42:39.520 --> 42:41.200
Um, man, that's a fucking cool.

42:41.200 --> 42:44.480
I wish I knew that fucking ghost in college.

42:46.560 --> 42:48.320
What's up, dudes?

42:48.320 --> 42:49.920
Totally getting high, I see.

42:51.120 --> 42:52.720
Let me scoop some of this.

42:52.720 --> 42:55.760
Let me scoop some of this bodacious mac and cheese.

42:55.760 --> 42:58.240
Yes, the noodles are in the shape of dinosaurs.

42:58.240 --> 43:01.120
It's T-Rex-a-licious, my homies.

43:01.120 --> 43:05.920
Now the only thing I require in exchange is your immortal soul.

43:05.920 --> 43:08.800
Or give me a case that I can inhabit.

43:08.800 --> 43:12.480
I think a lot of, I think it was golden corral.

43:12.480 --> 43:15.120
There was some YouTube video that made the rounds

43:15.120 --> 43:23.440
of this young man who was a whistle blower.

43:23.440 --> 43:26.000
The Snowden of roast beef.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.800
Did someone say Snowden of roast beef?

43:28.800 --> 43:32.960
Who filmed a YouTube video of apparently golden,

43:32.960 --> 43:35.360
this is his particular golden corral location.

43:35.360 --> 43:38.000
I don't want to slander golden corral as a whole.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.840
It's probably just confined to this one thing.

43:40.800 --> 43:42.320
Although we all know that it wasn't.

43:42.320 --> 43:44.640
He was pointing out how when they were getting

43:44.640 --> 43:46.480
their inspections done, everything that was unseemly,

43:46.480 --> 43:48.800
they hid back by the dumpsters, including like,

43:48.800 --> 43:51.600
one of those food service racks filled with meat.

43:52.320 --> 43:53.760
Just like chilling by the dumpster.

43:53.760 --> 43:56.000
And he brought it back like, I don't think this is okay.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.360
I'm making a difference in the world.

43:57.360 --> 44:02.240
Like we know, like when we cross the threshold

44:02.240 --> 44:05.120
of the golden corral, we know what we're getting into.

44:05.920 --> 44:11.840
We don't need you to put a face to the beef parasites.

44:11.840 --> 44:14.000
Listen, a ship in harbor is safe.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.360
Right, right.

44:15.360 --> 44:19.840
A steak in my, a steak in front of me is doing just fine.

44:19.840 --> 44:22.560
A steak in the refrigerator is doing just fine.

44:22.560 --> 44:24.480
A steak in the refrigerator is safe.

44:24.480 --> 44:26.800
A steak on the counter has truly lived.

44:26.800 --> 44:29.840
A steak by the dumpster's safety is questionable.

44:29.840 --> 44:30.960
But you, but YOLO.

44:33.200 --> 44:37.440
You know, uh, Sydney, uh, uh, my wife is a physician.

44:37.440 --> 44:38.160
Oh, come on.

44:38.160 --> 44:40.960
Every fucking, yeah, let's all fight wives.

44:40.960 --> 44:41.840
Is that what you want to do?

44:43.040 --> 44:44.960
Oh, it's a good old fashioned wife fight.

44:44.960 --> 44:46.080
I want to tell this anecdote.

44:46.080 --> 44:51.520
She, she, for one of her rotations, she did, uh, uh, health inspections.

44:51.520 --> 44:52.640
She not, she did them.

44:52.640 --> 44:54.800
She, she went along with people doing them.

44:54.800 --> 45:00.000
And, uh, at one of our local restaurants of which I will inform both of you off the air.

45:00.000 --> 45:00.480
Just say it now.

45:00.480 --> 45:01.120
I'll cut it out.

45:01.920 --> 45:02.560
Fuck me.

45:02.560 --> 45:04.000
I love that restaurant.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.920
No, literally a hundred times.

45:07.920 --> 45:11.840
It's a, it's, it's a, it's a hot Mexican restaurant in our area.

45:11.840 --> 45:15.520
She goes into the, that just narrowed it down to one restaurant in Huntington,

45:15.520 --> 45:16.240
Virginia.

45:16.240 --> 45:18.400
Uh, she goes into the back closed.

45:18.400 --> 45:18.800
Yeah.

45:18.800 --> 45:24.720
And there's, there's a, uh, no, it's not flapjack to Napa's the pancake Mexican restaurant.

45:24.720 --> 45:26.080
That's a real thing in Huntington.

45:26.080 --> 45:26.800
Stop by sometime.

45:26.800 --> 45:27.840
I'll take you out.

45:27.840 --> 45:33.520
Uh, we, uh, she, she looks in the back and the health inspector is talking to other people

45:33.520 --> 45:40.080
there and they are stirring a giant pot of something with what appears to be a stick.

45:40.080 --> 45:50.480
So they asked the person doing the stirring what that is.

45:50.480 --> 45:57.760
And what they say is a stick and they say, is it, uh, something you've used for a long

45:57.760 --> 45:58.720
time?

45:58.720 --> 46:04.560
Is it so, you know, maybe assuming it's some sort of like seasoning or maybe it's a very

46:04.560 --> 46:06.640
tightly bound bundle of sage.

46:06.640 --> 46:08.800
That's something like that.

46:08.800 --> 46:12.160
And they said, no, we found it in the alley.

46:13.200 --> 46:16.000
You cannot fail your health inspector.

46:16.000 --> 46:20.160
And also there's a dead guy over there.

46:20.160 --> 46:21.440
He's been there for a while.

46:22.000 --> 46:22.240
Why?

46:22.800 --> 46:23.760
Pardon me.

46:23.760 --> 46:24.560
Pardon me, chef.

46:25.280 --> 46:26.160
Sous chef.

46:26.160 --> 46:27.520
Why are you made of diapers?

46:29.360 --> 46:32.720
Why am I talking to a bundle of diapers with a sharpied face on it?

46:32.720 --> 46:37.120
Friends.

46:37.120 --> 46:39.360
Thank you so much for spending another hour with us.

46:39.360 --> 46:46.400
We certainly appreciate our, uh, our, uh, slightly under by the time we get to the end.

46:47.040 --> 46:47.200
Yeah.

46:47.200 --> 46:48.880
Let's just take a long time to do our chores.

46:49.520 --> 46:51.680
Thank you for spending a union hour with us.

46:56.800 --> 46:59.840
We hope, uh, we, we hope you had as much fun as we did.

uh, buddies over there in Afghanistan.

47:36.160 --> 47:38.320
I mean, I mean, you guys fucking blew it out of the water.

47:38.320 --> 47:38.800
Oh my God.

47:38.800 --> 47:44.640
They're getting a PlayStation three, a GameCube, uh, like 20 games, a bunch of

47:44.640 --> 47:46.320
four different fucking Pokemon games.

47:46.320 --> 47:52.560
These fools are going to have like half of all, I think it's 653 Pokemon at this point.

47:52.560 --> 47:56.080
They are going to be good to go in X and Y come out and they are going to be,

47:56.080 --> 47:58.160
they're going to have a fu- they're going to be fully stocked.

47:59.200 --> 48:00.560
Uh, yeah, they're loaded.

48:00.560 --> 48:04.800
Um, thank you to, uh, companies like Wizards of the Coast, Sega, Sony.

48:04.800 --> 48:07.120

A Wizard, a Wizard of the Coast, Ubisoft, Activision, Naughty Dog.

48:10.960 --> 48:12.800
Thanks to Richard who lives on the coast.

Uh, and we want to say thank you to just some of the donors who, uh, kicked in like, here we go.

Thank you so much.

48:43.600 --> 48:44.800
Richard Kostman.

48:46.640 --> 48:50.000
Thank you for giving to, uh, to Tristan.

Um, I'm sure he and his buddies really appreciate it and, and we

48:53.520 --> 48:55.200
appreciate all of you being so super generous.

48:55.200 --> 48:56.960
Tristan, I need you to come home safe.

48:58.160 --> 49:02.080
A, because, you know, you're doing the Lord's work over there and you're protecting us and

49:02.080 --> 49:04.240
our freedoms and we, we love you for that.

49:04.240 --> 49:09.600
But B, you are going to have some, some super rare Pokemon from Gen 4 that I am,

49:09.600 --> 49:12.640
I am, have been negligent in capturing.

49:12.640 --> 49:15.760
Um, basically this care package is estimated before it should be,

49:15.760 --> 49:17.280
cost it being worth $3,000.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.120
So you're all like-

49:19.120 --> 49:20.240
So you're rich.

49:20.240 --> 49:23.920
So you're all amazing for, for kicking in on that and you're, you're the best.

49:23.920 --> 49:24.560
So thank you.

49:25.200 --> 49:27.760
Um, can I, can I give a shout out?

49:28.640 --> 49:29.440
Please.

49:29.440 --> 49:32.800
I, this is, I know this is rare for me, but I want to thank John Roderick and the Long

49:32.800 --> 49:35.200
Winters for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure.

49:35.200 --> 49:39.520
Um, which you can hear on the album putting the days to bed.

49:39.520 --> 49:40.960
I believe it's track nine or track 10.

49:40.960 --> 49:42.880
It's close to the end of the album to close it down.

49:43.520 --> 49:47.440
Um, fuck that album is so, so good.

49:47.440 --> 49:48.640
Ugh.

49:48.640 --> 49:49.360
Go buy that.

49:49.360 --> 49:51.920
It's, it's so good that it makes me angry to listen to it.

49:51.920 --> 49:53.840
You know, like why isn't all the music like this?

49:55.040 --> 49:58.880
Uh, if you want to, uh, head over to the forums, talk about the show.

49:58.880 --> 49:59.840
We sure appreciate that.

49:59.840 --> 50:04.560
And while you're there listening to the rest of the max fun shows, they're all at maximumfun.org.

50:04.560 --> 50:06.480
Like stop podcasting yourself.

50:06.480 --> 50:08.320
One bad mother to judge John Hodgman.

50:08.320 --> 50:09.120
Wham bang pow.

50:09.680 --> 50:12.720
Uh, a hit medical podcast called Sawbones.

50:12.720 --> 50:15.920
I do with my wife, Sydney, uh, who's a physician as you know.

50:15.920 --> 50:16.960
God damn it.

50:16.960 --> 50:23.760
Curator of the alley stick, uh, that I am assuming she, uh, uh, confiscated.

50:23.760 --> 50:25.040
She's not going to shut that fucking.

50:25.040 --> 50:26.640
I need that restaurant in my life.

50:26.640 --> 50:27.760
I mean, I need it too.

50:27.760 --> 50:30.320
This mystery restaurant that I won't tell anybody about.

50:30.320 --> 50:32.880
And, uh, if, if you're in Huntington and you want to know, just,

50:33.920 --> 50:38.240
as far, just so you know, I'm going to continue to eat there and have several times I heard this

50:38.240 --> 50:41.840
story because, and we're going to continue to drop hints there.

50:41.840 --> 50:48.480
You can get drunk there for like 350 and you can eat chimichangas the size of your forearm.

50:51.200 --> 50:55.200
Anyway, and if you, uh, if you would like a message, uh, right up there along with, uh,

50:55.200 --> 51:00.240
our sponsors, extreme restraints, then just go to maximumfun.org forward slash

51:00.240 --> 51:03.440
Jumbotron and you can have a personal message or a business message.

51:03.440 --> 51:08.240
Or if you have a company that would like to sponsor the show, then, then come on down.

51:08.240 --> 51:14.960
Uh, next week's episode will be a little late cause Griffin will be touring, uh,

51:16.880 --> 51:18.240
Germany, I believe it is.

51:18.240 --> 51:20.000
Uh, it's Germany next week.

51:20.000 --> 51:20.240
Yeah.

51:20.880 --> 51:21.920
Germany next week.

51:21.920 --> 51:23.520
Uh, and, and so we'll be a little late.

51:23.520 --> 51:26.400
So we apologize in advance, but we'll still get right back with you.

51:26.400 --> 51:30.320
Presumably with a very jet lag, Griffin, which should be, should be hysterical.

51:30.320 --> 51:32.960
Uh, and, and thank you so much for listening to our program.

51:32.960 --> 51:34.560
If you live in Germany and want to hang.

51:34.560 --> 51:37.680
It's a, it's a super big country.

51:37.680 --> 51:40.960
Um, so don't even, I would say probably don't bother.

51:40.960 --> 51:43.040
I'm probably probably not going to put in the effort.

51:44.480 --> 51:45.280
I'm just being honest.

51:45.280 --> 51:49.360
It's a, it's a super big country and I'm like, don't understand any of the languages there.

51:50.080 --> 51:53.760
Like, like regardless, Griffin, do you have a last question for everybody?

51:53.760 --> 51:54.080
Yeah.

51:54.080 --> 51:56.720
I have a final one that was sent in by Ryan Steiner.

51:56.720 --> 51:57.360
Thank you, Ryan.

51:57.360 --> 52:01.840
It's by Yahoo answers user Gisela Juarez, who asks.

52:01.840 --> 52:04.960
Have fear to be touched for bald persons.

52:08.960 --> 52:11.120
This has been my brother and my brother and me.

52:11.120 --> 52:34.320
This has been my brother and my brother and me, kiss your dad, square on the lips.
