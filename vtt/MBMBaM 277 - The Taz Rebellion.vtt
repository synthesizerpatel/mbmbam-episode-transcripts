00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.880
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.880 --> 00:38.800
It's a new craze, and good girls, do you want it? Just say, hey, I want it.

00:38.800 --> 00:44.800
Just say, hey, I want it.

00:44.800 --> 00:47.360
Hello, everybody, and welcome to our brother-brother-mean-advice show for the

00:47.360 --> 00:49.680
Machinera. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:49.680 --> 00:51.520
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.160 --> 00:55.200
Gang, T-G-I-F. It's your boy, Griffin McElroy.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.200
T-G-I-F.

00:57.200 --> 01:00.400
F stands for fuck day, doesn't it? I don't know.

01:00.400 --> 01:04.960
Wait, hold on. Thank goodness it's fuck day.

01:05.760 --> 01:10.960
How lazy this program has gotten with the cursing and just the language.

01:11.680 --> 01:13.520
Let's start it. Start it over.

01:14.480 --> 01:15.760
Okay. Hey, everybody.

01:16.400 --> 01:22.640
It's J-Slizzle here on the MIC. It's M-B-M-B-A-M and me, brother and me.

01:23.840 --> 01:28.160
I'm Travis, middle-est.

01:28.160 --> 01:34.320
Thank God it's fuck day. That was like a little dog made out of air horns.

01:35.040 --> 01:36.960
Walked into your fucking honeypot again.

01:38.000 --> 01:46.240
We're recording this on a Friday, so that means there's so much different material.

01:46.240 --> 01:49.040
We rarely ever record on a Friday.

01:50.880 --> 01:56.960
We have new stuff that we can talk about that we normally couldn't, like what's new in theaters

01:56.960 --> 01:58.640
opening this week? What's happening?

01:59.600 --> 02:01.280
Doesn't Avengers come out this weekend?

02:03.440 --> 02:05.520
Avengers is next weekend.

02:06.320 --> 02:09.520
This weekend, we've got the 33, which is about Chilean miners.

02:11.120 --> 02:11.920
Love the Cooper.

02:12.960 --> 02:14.000
Love the Coopers.

02:18.640 --> 02:22.160
By the Sea, kind of a movie.

02:22.160 --> 02:28.000
This is By the Sea Watch 2015.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.400
Commit to the bit. It's By the Sea Watch 2015.

02:31.440 --> 02:36.080
Okay. Welcome to By the Sea Watch 2015, where we're checking in on the new film By the Sea,

02:36.640 --> 02:38.880
starring Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.600
What? They're working together on a project?

02:42.240 --> 02:43.040
They're back.

02:43.040 --> 02:47.040
It's about an American writer named Roland and his wife Vanessa who arrive in a tranquil

02:47.040 --> 02:50.400
and picturesque sea resort in 1970s France.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.560
That sounds nice, but there's a comma.

02:52.560 --> 02:54.240
Their marriage in apparent crisis.

02:54.240 --> 02:54.720
Oh, boy.

02:54.720 --> 02:55.200
Yeah.

02:55.200 --> 02:58.320
And also, Loki's there. He's stirring up the pot.

02:58.320 --> 03:03.440
Dang, I got to race to the Burger King and pick up one of the commemorative frosted glasses

03:03.440 --> 03:05.360
for Take This Sea.

03:07.200 --> 03:11.520
Does everybody have their Melanie Laurent action figures?

03:11.520 --> 03:12.880
Because I know I do.

03:12.880 --> 03:18.000
Yeah, I don't know why they did multiples of them, but I'm excited to have the whole set.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.040
Because you got to have the chase figure. There's one where she's in sort of a floppy sun hat.

03:23.040 --> 03:23.440
Yeah.

03:23.440 --> 03:26.320
There's another one where she's smoking two cigarettes at the Riviera.

03:26.320 --> 03:31.760
I got the amiibo. I got the Melanie Laurent amiibo and you plug it into Mario Party 10,

03:31.760 --> 03:35.840
and then all of a sudden she's there and she's hanging out with Bowser and Sonic and friends.

03:35.840 --> 03:40.240
Did you get the one where you put vegetable oil in the little hole in her back and you crank the

03:40.240 --> 03:43.360
wheel and real sadness emanates from her?

03:43.360 --> 03:47.760
What did you say there? What were all those words?

03:50.880 --> 03:58.240
Travis was referencing a Darkwing Duck gas grenade gun that would shoot smoke

03:58.240 --> 03:59.520
if you put vegetable oil on it.

03:59.520 --> 04:00.800
It never worked, really?

04:00.800 --> 04:04.240
No, it did not. It was the most disappointing toy of my entire childhood.

04:04.240 --> 04:10.320
Yeah, it's really bad. Also, that reference, just so I understand, that was on par with you

04:10.320 --> 04:16.160
making an inside joke about a thing that's in your pocket that nobody else could possibly know about.

04:17.120 --> 04:20.400
You don't think other people got and were disappointed by the Darkwing Duck?

04:20.400 --> 04:28.000
The shitty Darkwing Duck gun? No, gang, I want to talk about this fucking unstoppable

04:28.000 --> 04:32.640
potential energy that the weekend holds. You're not excited about this intro, I can tell.

04:32.640 --> 04:36.400
But listen, anything can happen on Saturday, anything can happen on Sunday.

04:36.400 --> 04:39.840
I'm sick of recording this show on Sunday knowing what has happened on Saturday and Sunday.

04:39.840 --> 04:41.440
It's all about potential energy.

04:41.440 --> 04:46.000
I don't have that anymore in my life. My weekends are now,

04:46.560 --> 04:50.400
they're dictated by my baby wakes up at 5 30 in the morning and that's my-

04:50.400 --> 04:52.480
More time to party, more potential energy.

04:52.480 --> 04:55.600
Yeah, think of all the partying you could get done in a single day.

04:55.600 --> 04:58.320
I've never been to a 5 30 a.m. party, Justin. What are they like?

04:59.520 --> 05:03.600
Well, you watch Little Einsteins and eat some cheesy poofs.

05:03.600 --> 05:04.000
Nice.

05:04.720 --> 05:07.760
Now, what's a cheesy poof? Is that like a Cheeto?

05:07.760 --> 05:13.280
No, it's like a Cheeto, but it is a single piece of puffed corn,

05:15.040 --> 05:17.440
hulless puffed corn.

05:17.440 --> 05:20.960
And what kind of psychedelic effects do the puffed corn have?

05:22.080 --> 05:26.320
There, there, no, there's no, okay, I can see what you've done there.

05:26.320 --> 05:29.360
There's no psychedelic effects because you give them to your baby when you're just like,

05:30.000 --> 05:34.400
not, your heart's not in it at that exact moment. You know what I mean?

05:34.400 --> 05:35.440
It's like a-

05:35.440 --> 05:37.760
Your heart's just not in it right now.

05:38.320 --> 05:43.840
Yeah, it's sort of a, it's like a baby tapas for the disillusioned dad.

05:43.840 --> 05:48.720
Yeah, that's, wow, that's actually on the box. I didn't know you've gotten those before.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.040
There's Chester Cheeto on the front like,

05:51.040 --> 05:55.040
enjoy these baby tapas for the disillusioned pops.

05:55.680 --> 05:58.080
And he smokes a cigarette. He's smoking a cigarette on this one.

05:58.080 --> 05:58.800
That's crazy.

05:58.800 --> 06:02.320
And blowing it in your face. You gotta put vegetable oil in for it to do it.

06:02.320 --> 06:06.960
Yeah, please add vegetable oil to this bag of shitty Cheetos.

06:07.760 --> 06:10.560
Okay, listen, it's an advice show for the modern era.

06:10.560 --> 06:12.960
Let's fucking help some people for once out.

06:12.960 --> 06:13.600
Can we-

06:13.600 --> 06:14.000
Live.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.160
Should we also address the fact that I feel like we recorded an episode like 15 minutes ago?

06:18.160 --> 06:21.360
Yeah, this must be what it's like to have a job where you work every day.

06:21.360 --> 06:22.080
Oh, I hate it.

06:23.120 --> 06:28.880
Yeah, but that doesn't matter because this is about to be a great, great episode.

06:28.880 --> 06:29.520
All right, rip the-

06:29.520 --> 06:30.240
Did you guys know-

06:30.240 --> 06:30.800
Rip the shit.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.000
Did you guys hear about that?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.320
I saw it on Huffington Post.

06:34.320 --> 06:39.200
My four and a half year old son has red hair and is generally regarded as being adorable.

06:39.200 --> 06:42.640
Frequently, when in a public space, a stranger, usually middle-aged or older woman,

06:42.640 --> 06:44.240
will comment on the color of his hair.

06:44.240 --> 06:47.200
Sometimes they will say it's beautiful, but more often they will say something like,

06:47.200 --> 06:48.640
oh, look at that red hair.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.000
I never know how to respond to this.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.800
Their tone is probably not like mine.

06:52.800 --> 06:56.960
I appreciate that they want to compliment him or something he has no control over,

06:56.960 --> 07:01.200
but the statement is usually followed by an awkward silence and maybe like a,

07:01.200 --> 07:02.880
yeah, with a forced chuckle.

07:03.440 --> 07:06.880
Is there a way I can acknowledge their compliment gracefully?

07:06.880 --> 07:07.680
That's from Josh.

07:08.560 --> 07:09.680
Just rip out a clump.

07:09.680 --> 07:10.320
Give them.

07:10.320 --> 07:10.960
Give them some.

07:10.960 --> 07:11.600
Give them a piece.

07:12.240 --> 07:12.960
Take a clump.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.000
It'll last longer.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.120
A sample for you to take.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.800
Stuart, be quiet.

07:18.800 --> 07:21.440
You know the arrangement that we have.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.280
Here, eat this shitty top.

07:23.280 --> 07:23.840
Eat this crunchy top of us.

07:23.840 --> 07:25.200
You patchy little ding dong.

07:27.360 --> 07:30.240
This is one of the reasons I hate small talk,

07:30.240 --> 07:36.000
but don't you think, what do you think the compliment giver in this scenario

07:36.000 --> 07:38.160
is expecting in the response?

07:38.160 --> 07:39.600
Look at that red hair.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.160
Ah, I see you've noticed his red hair.

07:42.160 --> 07:42.800
Come with me.

07:44.080 --> 07:48.640
I think that ha ha, yeah, is exactly what they expect and all you need to give.

07:49.920 --> 07:53.520
Yeah, you could also just make a sort of another observation

07:53.520 --> 07:55.360
just sort of about your immediate surroundings.

07:55.360 --> 07:56.880
Like, oh yeah, and there's some soup.

07:57.680 --> 07:58.880
Look at that green tree.

07:58.880 --> 07:59.920
Hmm.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.080
Maybe notice, maybe notice something on them.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.640
Hey, there's a purple sweatshirt with a wolf on it.

08:04.640 --> 08:05.360
That's sweet.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.080
That's really cool.

08:06.080 --> 08:07.440
Pretty badass sweatshirt.

08:07.440 --> 08:07.760
Trade you.

08:07.760 --> 08:08.720
Where'd you get that?

08:08.720 --> 08:09.200
Trade you.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.000
Color for color.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Give you some of this boy's sweet hair.

08:12.000 --> 08:12.800
Give me a sleeve.

08:14.560 --> 08:15.520
I'm working on a spell.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.520
It's one of the components I need.

08:19.520 --> 08:22.080
See, my wife, her dad stole some beans.

08:22.080 --> 08:23.200
Shit's crazy.

08:23.200 --> 08:24.960
Anyway, can't get her knocked up.

08:24.960 --> 08:28.800
Unless I have a clump as red as blood as sleep as purple as magic.

08:28.800 --> 08:32.240
Hey, speaking of sleeves as purple as magic,

08:32.240 --> 08:36.000
I picked up Riley, my 15-year-old sister-in-law

08:36.000 --> 08:37.360
from the high school yesterday.

08:37.920 --> 08:41.680
And there was a, I saw a,

08:41.680 --> 08:43.600
I was asking her about some of the teens in the area.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.520
Teen fashion update.

08:45.520 --> 08:48.080
Teen fashion update with Justin McElroy.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.080
You guys are gonna feel bad when I finish this.

08:52.960 --> 08:55.040
I asked her, you know, about some of the teens

08:55.040 --> 08:56.880
that were surrounding our car.

08:56.880 --> 08:59.200
Just kind of making small talk about teens.

08:59.200 --> 09:03.120
And I saw this fucking dope-ass kid,

09:03.840 --> 09:07.600
like jangly, crazy Jim Morrison hair,

09:07.600 --> 09:11.520
and wearing a Huntington Blizzard sweatshirt.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.840
Fuck, yes, yes, yes, yes.

09:13.840 --> 09:17.120
I almost hopped out of, okay,

09:17.120 --> 09:21.040
super quick Huntington Blizzard is the long defunct.

09:21.040 --> 09:23.680
Long defunct, very defunct.

09:23.680 --> 09:27.040
I would argue it was defunct while it was still fun.

09:28.320 --> 09:30.400
Every player on the Huntington Blizzard

09:30.400 --> 09:32.240
was also looking for other jobs.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.520
Yeah, it was a minor league,

09:35.520 --> 09:37.680
a long defunct minor league hockey team.

09:38.720 --> 09:41.520
Probably our closest brush with professional sports.

09:41.520 --> 09:44.720
We have the arena football team, the locomotives.

09:45.520 --> 09:47.440
That's true, we did have that.

09:47.440 --> 09:48.800
But we had the Huntington Blizzard,

09:48.800 --> 09:50.720
which made like, considering it was hockey,

09:50.720 --> 09:53.520
which is not a huge sport around here,

09:54.560 --> 09:56.640
it hung in there pretty good.

09:56.640 --> 09:58.480
It did, they did pretty well.

09:58.480 --> 10:02.400
This fucking kid was wearing a Huntington Blizzard sweatshirt.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.880
I almost got out of the car and offered to buy it from him,

10:04.880 --> 10:07.520
so I could, I don't know, use as a bandana or something,

10:07.520 --> 10:09.840
because it certainly wasn't gonna fit my frame.

10:09.840 --> 10:13.120
But I just wanted to update you guys on that.

10:13.120 --> 10:15.200
And this has been the teen fashion update.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.920
When you asked Riley about that kid,

10:17.920 --> 10:20.800
was she like, oh, he just keeps showing up.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.320
I don't think he's a student.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.120
Did she give you any background on how awesome this kid was?

10:26.640 --> 10:28.160
She said that she knows him.

10:28.160 --> 10:30.560
And I was like, can I get an introducio?

10:30.560 --> 10:32.800
And she was like, I think that would be inappropriate.

10:32.800 --> 10:36.160
I was like, okay, I'll just stop and introduce myself.

10:36.160 --> 10:38.560
Did you run up to him and try and put a hand on that shirt,

10:38.560 --> 10:40.400
but your hand phased completely through him

10:40.400 --> 10:43.120
because he's a ghost that was murdered in 1996?

10:43.120 --> 10:48.000
At the height of Blizzard fever.

10:48.720 --> 10:50.880
When you see a kid like that, are you like me?

10:50.880 --> 10:53.840
And do you think that kid is either super cool

10:53.840 --> 10:57.040
or like a total outcast, right?

10:57.040 --> 11:00.720
Either he's like really ironic and on point with it,

11:00.720 --> 11:02.320
or it's like, oh God, there's the kid

11:02.320 --> 11:04.240
who wears the Blizzard sweatshirt every day.

11:04.240 --> 11:04.720
Who knows?

11:04.720 --> 11:07.280
Watch any coming of age movie released nowadays.

11:07.280 --> 11:09.040
I'm talking about your Paper Towns.

11:09.040 --> 11:11.120
I'm talking about your Yumi and Dupree.

11:11.120 --> 11:13.920
That's not funny.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.360
You know the teen comedy.

11:16.080 --> 11:17.200
Your Marmaduke.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.000
Your Marmaduke.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.680
And it's just like the kids.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.120
Your drill bit tailors.

11:21.120 --> 11:25.520
The artsy kids are the ones that are making it happen.

11:25.520 --> 11:27.680
And that was not true.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.680
I hung out with a group of people.

11:29.680 --> 11:34.080
One of them had a fan website about Final Fantasy III.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.960
And that was sort of the par for the course.

11:36.960 --> 11:41.600
And we were, I think, on that Paper Towns style.

11:42.560 --> 11:44.320
And we were derided.

11:45.440 --> 11:48.240
I think that's a side effect of consolidated high schools.

11:48.240 --> 11:51.360
There's so many students there that a true fiefdom

11:51.360 --> 11:53.440
of popularity cannot form.

11:53.440 --> 11:55.280
There are more like warring clans.

11:55.280 --> 11:55.920
You know what I mean?

11:56.960 --> 11:57.520
Do you guys want me to-

11:57.520 --> 11:58.560
I can mean girls?

11:58.560 --> 11:58.880
Yeah.

11:58.880 --> 11:59.280
Yeah, please.

11:59.280 --> 11:59.920
You remember.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.160
Oh my God.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.440
Fucking perfect.

12:03.440 --> 12:07.120
Transitione thank you to my man, level 9000 Yadru Drew,

12:07.120 --> 12:08.240
Drew Davenport.

12:08.240 --> 12:08.880
Thank you, Drew.

12:08.880 --> 12:12.160
It's by Yadru Answers user Tyler who asks,

12:12.160 --> 12:14.240
and let's be cool about this.

12:14.240 --> 12:17.760
Can we make an agreement to be fucking cool about this for once?

12:17.760 --> 12:18.000
Yes.

12:18.640 --> 12:21.360
Justin, I need a verbal confirmation.

12:22.320 --> 12:23.200
Yes, I'll be cool.

12:23.840 --> 12:26.720
I was not paying attention to what I agreed to be cool to.

12:26.720 --> 12:27.840
I don't think either of you did.

12:27.840 --> 12:28.960
That was crazy.

12:28.960 --> 12:30.720
I was letting my cat out of the room.

12:30.720 --> 12:32.080
It was very important.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.160
Well, you also let the cat out of the bag

12:34.160 --> 12:35.680
that you're an inconsiderate brother.

12:36.240 --> 12:36.640
Yup.

12:37.440 --> 12:39.760
Tyler asks, and let's be cool about this.

12:41.040 --> 12:45.840
Is a team a quote unquote nerd if they use a pocket watch?

12:48.000 --> 12:48.800
Update.

12:48.800 --> 12:52.560
Just recently my phone was fried when it fell in some water

12:52.560 --> 12:53.920
and I lost my wristwatch.

12:53.920 --> 12:58.160
Also, I am an avid Doctor Who fan, so I opted to get a pocket watch.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.760
Man, I would have been good buddies with this guy

12:59.760 --> 13:01.920
it sounds like in high school.

13:01.920 --> 13:05.600
I am not the most social person, but I still want to be normal.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.680
I know that people tell you to be your own person,

13:07.680 --> 13:11.120
but in reality, this advice is not necessarily applicable.

13:11.120 --> 13:12.800
I had some trouble with that word.

13:12.800 --> 13:15.920
So I ask again, if a teen wears a pocket watch,

13:15.920 --> 13:18.720
will they be made fun of or labeled a nerd?

13:18.720 --> 13:22.640
Keep in mind, this watch will usually be in the pocket of jeans.

13:22.640 --> 13:24.320
Ah, I'm so glad.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.880
I'm so glad he clarified because I was about to say

13:26.880 --> 13:29.760
it depends on how whole hog he goes with it.

13:29.760 --> 13:33.040
Don't vote for pocket watch, it's in the pocket of big jeans.

13:34.160 --> 13:38.560
If he went like wested and like full on like a trouser

13:38.560 --> 13:43.440
and some spats and like, you know, like a like tails

13:43.440 --> 13:48.160
and he was like the dopest classiest dress kid in high school.

13:48.960 --> 13:52.560
No, I think he's gone around the corner at that point and he's awesome.

13:52.560 --> 13:56.640
If he's wearing a t-shirt and jeans and a pocket watch,

13:56.640 --> 13:59.280
he is not fully committed to the look

13:59.280 --> 14:03.120
and therefore, yes, but it's not because the pocket watch is nerdy.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.720
It's because of his lack of commitment.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.280
Can you, but like, okay.

14:07.280 --> 14:10.720
You want him to look like a private dick is what you're saying?

14:10.720 --> 14:14.240
You want to look like the lead singer of the Cherry Poppin' Daddies?

14:14.240 --> 14:18.320
I would also accept lead singer of like your Panda at the Disco.

14:19.040 --> 14:19.280
Yeah.

14:19.280 --> 14:20.560
Right? That's a cool look.

14:21.520 --> 14:24.800
I just, I think that every look is okay,

14:24.800 --> 14:28.720
but you just, you have to be able to commit to it.

14:28.720 --> 14:31.120
And like, this is an important thing

14:31.120 --> 14:32.800
that I think a lot of people miss out on.

14:32.800 --> 14:39.280
Like, if you get like, if you're worried about something being cool or normal

14:39.280 --> 14:41.520
and it's something that's like outside the norm,

14:41.520 --> 14:46.000
that can still be cool, but affectations aren't cool.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.760
So like, are you wearing a pocket?

14:48.560 --> 14:50.880
Like, if you are the sort of person where like,

14:52.160 --> 14:54.480
it is natural to you to wear a pocket watch

14:54.480 --> 14:56.400
for this reason and this reason and this reason,

14:56.400 --> 14:59.680
you're an old soul and you only listen to fucking 40s on four

14:59.680 --> 15:01.280
on Sirius XM or some shit.

15:01.280 --> 15:03.840
And that's like, that's your life and you're living it

15:03.840 --> 15:05.360
and you're owning it.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.760
Then like, yeah, absolutely, pocket watch.

15:07.760 --> 15:09.360
Own it and wear it and do it.

15:09.360 --> 15:12.400
Let me name three names that if you saw them wearing a pocket watch,

15:12.400 --> 15:17.040
you would say, yup, Paul F. Tompkins, John Hodgman, John Roderick.

15:17.040 --> 15:17.840
No.

15:17.840 --> 15:18.160
Johnny Depp.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.200
Three super cool dudes.

15:19.200 --> 15:19.920
Johnny Depp.

15:20.560 --> 15:21.440
Johnny Depp.

15:21.440 --> 15:21.840
Thank you.

15:21.840 --> 15:23.600
Ronnie, Ronnie Depp.

15:23.600 --> 15:27.040
Johnny's twin brother who you never hear about.

15:27.040 --> 15:30.000
Ronnie Depp works at the clock factory.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.760
Yeah, Ronnie James Dio.

15:31.760 --> 15:34.080
Yeah, he also works at the clock factory

15:34.080 --> 15:37.440
and they need those pocket watches to keep all their shit on time.

15:40.320 --> 15:41.840
I've worn a pocket watch before.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.640
Well, we've all worn some shit, Travis.

15:44.640 --> 15:47.760
Well, like in a suit form, I was in a suit.

15:47.760 --> 15:50.800
It's a good look when you're a three-piece suit with a vest

15:50.800 --> 15:55.200
with the pocket specifically meant for the watch to go into.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.160
That makes sense.

15:56.160 --> 15:57.280
That does make sense.

15:57.280 --> 15:57.920
Not so much.

15:57.920 --> 16:00.240
Jeans, not as much sense.

16:00.240 --> 16:03.520
You're in high school and you have a pocket watch in your pocket

16:03.520 --> 16:07.600
and you have on some aesthetic goggles you bought from Hot Topic.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.600
There is also a clock in every room in high school.

16:11.600 --> 16:14.720
That's a good point, Travis, and in the hallways.

16:14.720 --> 16:15.440
Everywhere.

16:15.440 --> 16:18.080
Yeah, you can't even be late for shit in high school.

16:18.080 --> 16:21.680
There are people with like belts on telling you where to go constantly.

16:21.680 --> 16:25.520
Oh my, it seems my 10.30 class has begun.

16:25.520 --> 16:26.640
I'm late.

16:26.640 --> 16:28.160
That's never happened.

16:28.160 --> 16:29.280
No, that's never happened.

16:29.280 --> 16:32.480
You know another thing that's never happened on Earth

16:32.480 --> 16:37.200
that was like probably the biggest lie propagated by TV and movies

16:37.200 --> 16:39.440
in my young years that was like I was disillusioned by?

16:40.560 --> 16:42.000
Free period.

16:42.000 --> 16:42.320
Yeah.

16:42.320 --> 16:44.480
You guys ever see that in any TV show movie?

16:44.480 --> 16:46.640
Like, oh, I have a free period right now.

16:46.640 --> 16:48.560
That does not exist.

16:48.560 --> 16:50.800
I would lump Study Hall into that, too.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.400
That's not a thing.

16:52.400 --> 16:56.160
You know what drove me crazy in like teen movies based in high school

16:56.160 --> 16:59.680
is sometimes in those movies, the boys and the girls would kiss each other.

16:59.680 --> 17:02.400
Like, magical fantasy.

17:02.400 --> 17:03.440
Get real.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.240
It doesn't happen.

17:04.240 --> 17:07.200
And they would go to like parties in high school?

17:07.200 --> 17:10.480
More importantly, proceeding that they'd be invited to one or two.

17:10.480 --> 17:11.920
No, no, no.

17:11.920 --> 17:15.760
Yeah, I saw one shot of a movie where there was this kid who was in high school

17:15.760 --> 17:19.600
and it showed the clock and his clock said 11 30 p.m.

17:19.600 --> 17:22.160
And I was like, continuity error over here.

17:22.160 --> 17:23.200
Get the DP.

17:23.200 --> 17:25.840
We're going to reshoot this scene because who's up that late?

17:25.840 --> 17:26.400
Nobody.

17:28.320 --> 17:29.200
Don't wear a pocket watch.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.240
Don't wear a pocket watch.

17:30.240 --> 17:32.960
Unless you're the type of person who wears a boneless.

17:32.960 --> 17:36.880
You're probably just not like you really take a look at your look.

17:37.440 --> 17:41.840
Are you completely owning the being a pocket watch person?

17:41.840 --> 17:44.960
You can't start from the pocket watch and build from there.

17:44.960 --> 17:46.800
That's why it's called an accessory.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.760
I feel like that's a good rule of thumb for like, affectation.

17:49.760 --> 17:53.600
If you have to stop and think, am I the type of person who could?

17:53.600 --> 17:54.080
You're not.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.400
Like, it should be just like second nature that you're like,

17:56.400 --> 17:58.320
oh, got to pick up a pocket watch today.

17:58.320 --> 18:01.600
Like, it's just on your list of things to do and not like,

18:01.600 --> 18:05.280
I am making a commitment to a whole new me with this accessory.

18:05.280 --> 18:06.000
Like, no.

18:07.840 --> 18:10.400
I don't necessarily 100% agree with you there Trav.

18:10.400 --> 18:13.360
Sometimes you just got to throw your hat over the fence and say,

18:13.360 --> 18:16.640
this is going to be a hard struggle,

18:16.640 --> 18:18.320
but I am going to start with the pocket watch.

18:18.320 --> 18:21.040
And I know that I'm going to look like an asshole for a little while,

18:21.040 --> 18:22.320
but I got to start somewhere.

18:22.320 --> 18:23.360
You got to commit to this.

18:23.360 --> 18:25.760
Sometimes you just got to throw your watch into your pocket.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.720
And then throw your pocket over the fence.

18:30.720 --> 18:31.440
My pants.

18:32.720 --> 18:33.840
How about another question?

18:33.840 --> 18:34.160
Yeah.

18:34.160 --> 18:34.480
Whoa.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.600
My boyfriend and I are looking at moving out together.

18:37.600 --> 18:41.760
The only problem is I would rather share roommates with roommates we don't know.

18:41.760 --> 18:44.240
And he would rather move in with his friends.

18:44.240 --> 18:46.160
Renting with just us would be a little pricey

18:46.160 --> 18:47.680
and would mean we would have to wait longer

18:47.680 --> 18:49.920
to find a place in our price range that is nice.

18:50.480 --> 18:51.600
How do we resolve this?

18:51.600 --> 18:52.400
That's some Jess.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.480
I kind of get this.

18:54.480 --> 18:54.800
Yeah.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.720
I've only ever lived with people I knew,

18:59.600 --> 19:03.520
but that's always been to varying degrees of how well I knew them.

19:03.520 --> 19:06.960
And there is something to be said that if you move in with people you know too well,

19:06.960 --> 19:11.840
that kind of familiarity can breed a little bit of friction.

19:11.840 --> 19:14.560
You know, there is like something tempting to that idea of like,

19:14.560 --> 19:18.560
oh, my roommate is just like a random person I met through a service

19:19.360 --> 19:21.360
and we see each other in the morning

19:21.360 --> 19:23.760
and sometimes run into each other when we come home from work,

19:23.760 --> 19:26.080
but we're under no onus to like hang out

19:26.080 --> 19:28.960
or like have dinner together or do shit together.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.120
We're just sharing a space and that's it.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.480
Especially if you're moving in

19:32.480 --> 19:34.960
and like your significant other is coming with you.

19:35.840 --> 19:36.240
I don't know.

19:36.240 --> 19:38.480
There's something to be said about the idea of like,

19:38.480 --> 19:40.880
they're just another person living in this space.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.520
A random roommate is just a friend that you don't hate yet.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.120
Exactly.

19:45.120 --> 19:46.160
But you'll get there.

19:46.160 --> 19:48.960
It's just a friend that may never become a friend.

19:48.960 --> 19:49.200
Yeah.

19:49.760 --> 19:52.720
I would have a hard time with that.

19:52.720 --> 19:57.360
I would feel obligated to try to get to know the person,

19:57.360 --> 19:59.120
to try to get inside their head.

19:59.120 --> 19:59.920
Let me in.

19:59.920 --> 20:00.880
What's wrong with me?

20:03.040 --> 20:05.520
You have easy access to me, whatever you want it.

20:05.520 --> 20:07.680
Let's like make use of your resources,

20:07.680 --> 20:08.880
your natural justice resources.

20:08.880 --> 20:11.440
Every day you would just walk into their bedroom uninvited

20:11.440 --> 20:13.280
and just be like, let's just hash this shit out, man.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.320
Like, what are you talking?

20:14.320 --> 20:15.200
I have nothing.

20:15.200 --> 20:18.000
We have no beef to squash.

20:18.000 --> 20:18.960
We have nothing.

20:18.960 --> 20:19.360
We have nothing.

20:19.360 --> 20:19.920
We don't have beef.

20:19.920 --> 20:20.560
We don't have pork.

20:20.560 --> 20:21.360
We don't have chicken.

20:21.360 --> 20:23.280
We've got nothing between us, Derek.

20:23.280 --> 20:24.880
Why did you eat all my meat?

20:24.880 --> 20:26.000
There's nothing fishy.

20:27.200 --> 20:28.320
I love this roommate.

20:28.320 --> 20:29.360
I want to live with this guy.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.000
He knows a lot about meats.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
He's good at meat based puns.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.480
Listen, I was up all night.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.720
I had a graveyard shift at the butcher shop

20:38.720 --> 20:40.240
and I would just like to sleep place.

20:40.240 --> 20:40.480
Thank you.

20:40.480 --> 20:42.640
I left you the bacon in the fridge with your name on it.

20:42.640 --> 20:43.680
What more do you want?

20:43.680 --> 20:45.360
That would actually be a super cool roommate.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.600
It'd be a good roommate, man.

20:47.600 --> 20:48.000
Oh, yeah.

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
I would love to live with a butcher I've never met before.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.920
Griffin, are we going to return to your cockamamie theory

20:55.920 --> 20:57.840
that everybody who's a butcher is doing it

20:57.840 --> 21:00.240
so they have a cover for when they eventually murder somebody?

21:00.240 --> 21:04.400
Uh, it's not cockamamie as much as it is

21:04.400 --> 21:06.560
practical life-saving knowledge.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.560
Why, you wouldn't live with a butcher?

21:08.560 --> 21:10.640
Um, I would not live with a butcher, no.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.400
There's also something to be said though

21:12.400 --> 21:15.520
to Jess's question, which is,

21:15.520 --> 21:18.080
do you also know the potential roommates

21:18.080 --> 21:20.160
your boyfriend wants to move in with?

21:20.160 --> 21:21.200
Sounds like it, doesn't it?

21:21.760 --> 21:25.360
But like, is it all your boyfriend's friends

21:25.360 --> 21:26.400
and you don't really know them?

21:26.400 --> 21:27.840
Because I could see where that would be a huge turnoff.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.120
Yeah, that would be really weird.

21:29.120 --> 21:32.240
That would, I actually feel what Travis is saying here

21:32.240 --> 21:35.760
of, yeah, then you're going to feel like

21:35.760 --> 21:37.840
a third wheel in your own house.

21:37.840 --> 21:38.560
Exactly.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.480
And that dog don't hunt.

21:40.480 --> 21:41.840
I don't know, what's the solution?

21:42.640 --> 21:45.520
Just stop, everybody stop getting roommates

21:45.520 --> 21:48.800
and live in Japanese capsule hotels in the Japanese style.

21:48.800 --> 21:49.840
Oh my god, yes.

21:50.400 --> 21:53.680
Oh my god, yes, Justin, you've made me so happy.

21:54.720 --> 21:54.960
Yeah.

21:55.520 --> 21:57.200
Justin, from downtown.

21:57.200 --> 22:00.240
I didn't know you had that particular insight in you.

22:01.280 --> 22:03.200
That's my one and I've been saving it.

22:03.200 --> 22:03.680
Now, I don't think-

22:03.680 --> 22:06.720
But if everybody would just live in Japanese capsule hotels.

22:06.720 --> 22:10.160
Yeah, I don't think there are long-term Japanese capsule hotels

22:10.160 --> 22:14.640
because they would be like little stinky garbage cans after a while.

22:17.600 --> 22:19.280
Unless they rotated like every night

22:19.920 --> 22:21.200
they moved them one to the left.

22:23.360 --> 22:24.720
Change places.

22:24.720 --> 22:26.960
Why would that be the worst?

22:28.400 --> 22:31.040
What, because are they cleaning them between?

22:31.040 --> 22:32.160
They're cleaning them between, yeah.

22:32.160 --> 22:35.520
But you can't, once you've slept in a bed like 100 times

22:35.520 --> 22:37.280
there's no getting that stink out.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.320
You got to keep rotating.

22:38.320 --> 22:38.800
That's true.

22:38.800 --> 22:40.240
It's all about stink confusion.

22:42.400 --> 22:45.680
You got to confuse those long-term Japanese capsule hotels.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.040
Man, this is a great idea.

22:47.040 --> 22:49.120
Austin would go gaga for this shit.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.440
Boutique, it's a boutique concept.

22:53.440 --> 22:56.880
It's boutique, it's small, it's tiny living.

22:58.560 --> 23:00.160
Yeah, tiny houses are huge right now.

23:00.160 --> 23:01.360
Well, wait, hold on.

23:01.360 --> 23:03.760
But imagine if you just like slept in a drawer

23:03.760 --> 23:06.080
and at that point you're like, oh, you live in a tiny house?

23:06.080 --> 23:07.760
Oh, I didn't know you were so wasteful.

23:07.760 --> 23:09.520
Do you really need that much space?

23:09.520 --> 23:11.600
I sleep in basically a cabinet.

23:11.600 --> 23:13.520
I'm basically Peter Pan Shadow.

23:13.520 --> 23:17.840
I basically just live in a drawer in Wendy's room.

23:17.840 --> 23:23.920
I have eight hours of oxygen pumped in to my sleep coffin every night.

23:23.920 --> 23:24.800
No more, no less.

23:24.800 --> 23:25.520
No more, no less.

23:25.520 --> 23:27.200
That's how non-wasteful I am.

23:28.080 --> 23:28.800
Over sleep?

23:28.800 --> 23:29.360
No, thank you.

23:29.360 --> 23:31.440
I'd like to see another day, please.

23:32.240 --> 23:32.640
No, no.

23:32.640 --> 23:36.080
But tell me about your tiny house with its bathroom and shower.

23:37.200 --> 23:40.880
Can I suggest a name for this gigantic capsule apartment

23:40.880 --> 23:42.240
that we've come up with?

23:42.240 --> 23:42.720
Yes.

23:42.720 --> 23:45.440
How about just Sleep?

23:45.440 --> 23:47.200
Because it's very utilitarian.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.720
It's just like a place where you go to.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.640
Maybe it's built above a restaurant

23:50.640 --> 23:53.600
where you're fed like a gelatinous protein cube

23:53.600 --> 23:57.760
that provides you like your necessary nutrients.

23:57.760 --> 23:58.480
No more, no less.

23:58.480 --> 23:59.680
And that place is just called Eat.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.560
Where's the umlaut go in Sleep?

24:02.560 --> 24:04.400
No, it wouldn't be there, one.

24:04.400 --> 24:05.440
There wouldn't be.

24:05.440 --> 24:06.560
I love Sleep.

24:06.560 --> 24:09.200
Let me give one tweet to it and see how this grabs you.

24:10.160 --> 24:10.560
Sleep?

24:13.120 --> 24:13.760
Very evocative.

24:13.760 --> 24:15.200
Oh, you can do what you want in there.

24:15.200 --> 24:17.280
Fuck yes, and the dot in the question mark

24:17.280 --> 24:19.520
is also a capsule that you can sleep in.

24:19.520 --> 24:23.200
But you only rotate into it once a year.

24:23.200 --> 24:24.560
But that's a great night's sleep.

24:26.800 --> 24:27.680
Great view, too.

24:27.680 --> 24:28.240
Great view.

24:28.240 --> 24:29.840
Well, for everybody walking outside,

24:29.840 --> 24:33.680
they can see like right up your sleeping tunic

24:33.680 --> 24:36.160
that you have to wear when you enter the hotel.

24:37.040 --> 24:37.840
Oh, this is good.

24:38.960 --> 24:40.000
How about a Yahoo?

24:40.000 --> 24:42.160
Yeah, how about we hit you with a Yahoo?

24:42.160 --> 24:44.640
This Yahoo was sent by Ira Ray.

24:44.640 --> 24:46.320
Are you Ira Ray?

24:46.320 --> 24:47.680
Who wants to know?

24:47.680 --> 24:48.240
Thank you, Ira.

24:48.240 --> 24:49.520
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

24:50.720 --> 24:52.640
Oh, something's gone wrong.

24:53.360 --> 24:56.480
Let's call them Iowa Greg.

25:00.320 --> 25:01.360
Iowa Greg asks,

25:01.920 --> 25:05.600
what is the fastest way to eat corn on the cob?

25:06.160 --> 25:07.760
Additional details.

25:07.760 --> 25:10.000
It's for a corn on the cob eating contest.

25:10.960 --> 25:13.040
You're disqualified right now,

25:13.040 --> 25:15.120
because you're juicing it, you're cheating.

25:15.920 --> 25:16.960
Yeah, that's the question.

25:16.960 --> 25:19.520
If you ask, and I'm glad he clarified

25:19.520 --> 25:21.840
that there were like rules and strictures,

25:21.840 --> 25:24.000
because the easiest way is, of course,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.160
to cut all the corn off of the cob.

25:26.160 --> 25:28.800
But then I feel like that would be frowned upon

25:28.800 --> 25:31.600
in a corn on the cob competition.

25:31.600 --> 25:34.160
I would think so, yeah.

25:34.160 --> 25:35.040
I would think so.

25:35.040 --> 25:36.640
Maybe just no one thought to ask.

25:36.640 --> 25:37.760
They bring you the plate and you're like,

25:37.760 --> 25:40.320
could you cut it off for me before we start?

25:40.320 --> 25:42.000
And they're like, actually, yeah.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.680
Yeah, we can do that.

25:43.680 --> 25:44.560
Cool, cool, cool.

25:44.560 --> 25:47.120
Can you load it into this thing I have?

25:47.680 --> 25:50.560
It's like a big PVC pipe with some hairspray cans

25:50.560 --> 25:51.520
attached to the back of it.

25:51.520 --> 25:53.360
And it says corn gun on it.

25:53.360 --> 25:55.280
Can you just dump it right in there?

25:55.280 --> 25:57.200
Yeah, I guess there's nothing in the bylaws

25:57.200 --> 25:58.720
that says anything about corn guns.

25:59.920 --> 26:01.920
Go ahead and slop it in, I guess.

26:03.280 --> 26:05.600
Could you modify a t-shirt cannon

26:05.600 --> 26:08.080
to just blast a copy right down your throat?

26:08.080 --> 26:10.560
Just get a copy and just blast it clean down.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.560
I think that you could do that once.

26:15.120 --> 26:16.480
Well, how much corn do you have to eat

26:16.480 --> 26:17.280
for this competition?

26:17.280 --> 26:19.200
Probably more than one ear, I would guess, right?

26:19.200 --> 26:21.760
Yeah, oh, is it speed or is it amount?

26:21.760 --> 26:24.160
Are you cleaning one cob or is it how many cobs

26:24.160 --> 26:25.280
can you do in a set amount of time?

26:25.280 --> 26:27.680
And I gotta tell you, Justin, down in the whole cob,

26:27.680 --> 26:30.000
that just seems like you're wasting space in your tummy.

26:30.640 --> 26:32.480
There's a lot of fiber and stuff in there

26:32.480 --> 26:34.080
that they don't expect you to eat.

26:34.800 --> 26:36.400
Obviously, they get very excited.

26:37.280 --> 26:38.720
The judges get very excited

26:38.720 --> 26:41.120
when they see somebody eat the entire cob,

26:41.840 --> 26:43.920
core and all, but it's-

26:43.920 --> 26:45.200
He's here to play.

26:45.200 --> 26:46.800
Yeah, so everybody, you know,

26:47.760 --> 26:50.560
everyone will throw one of those down during the run

26:50.560 --> 26:52.560
just to like show off to the crowd a little bit.

26:53.360 --> 26:57.920
But more than that, one sort of obligatory corn shot

26:57.920 --> 27:01.920
and you're just, you know, you're not being efficient.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.880
You know, I was sitting here thinking of how,

27:04.880 --> 27:06.560
I tried to figure out how I would do

27:06.560 --> 27:09.120
in a corn on the cob eating contest,

27:09.120 --> 27:10.960
like trying to gin up a number

27:10.960 --> 27:13.040
that represented how much corn I could eat.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.560
And I realized something.

27:14.560 --> 27:18.960
I don't really know because I can't think of a time in my life

27:19.520 --> 27:23.200
when I finished an ear of corn out with the buttering

27:23.200 --> 27:25.760
and the salting and the chewing and everything

27:25.760 --> 27:28.640
and thought, yeah, I'm ready to go through that again,

27:28.640 --> 27:31.920
one more again, pile it up, let me get another cob going.

27:31.920 --> 27:34.720
Like nobody's ever gotten full of corn on the cob.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.560
They're just like, I can't do this anymore.

27:36.560 --> 27:37.920
That was a lot of work.

27:37.920 --> 27:39.600
It's a whole like process.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.920
Like you can't just like, oh, I'm late for work.

27:41.920 --> 27:45.120
Okay, I'm just gonna grab a corn on the cob to go.

27:45.120 --> 27:46.720
Like it's a whole production.

27:47.360 --> 27:49.840
You ever see that little kid in like 20s movies?

27:50.400 --> 27:54.720
He's in his little Lord Fauntleroy outfit.

27:54.720 --> 27:56.800
He's licking a big lollipop.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.360
The closest you can get to that look as an adult

27:59.360 --> 28:01.040
in a socially permissible setting

28:01.040 --> 28:02.640
is eating a corn on the cob.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.400
It's just like you got your little pinkies up

28:04.400 --> 28:05.200
and you're just.

28:07.200 --> 28:09.360
If this person's talking about going pro,

28:09.360 --> 28:11.760
then I don't think they realize the sacrifices

28:11.760 --> 28:12.960
that are gonna be required of them

28:12.960 --> 28:15.040
because a lot of the corn pros out there

28:16.560 --> 28:20.240
have gotten tooth reversal surgery.

28:20.880 --> 28:23.360
And that's sort of where it's like a special kind of braces

28:23.360 --> 28:25.040
that they put on your teeth

28:25.040 --> 28:28.080
so that they all sort of bend backwards

28:28.080 --> 28:31.120
like in towards your throat hole there

28:31.120 --> 28:32.480
in the back of your mouth.

28:32.480 --> 28:34.560
And like a sarlacc.

28:34.560 --> 28:35.520
Kind of like a sarlacc, yeah,

28:35.520 --> 28:38.240
like a reversal of the teeth direction.

28:38.240 --> 28:41.600
And so they just jam a whole cob into their mouth

28:41.600 --> 28:42.960
and a little bit into their throat.

28:42.960 --> 28:44.160
And then as they pull it out,

28:44.160 --> 28:48.160
their backwards teeth just do all the scraping for them.

28:48.160 --> 28:51.200
And if you just get one clean go.

28:52.800 --> 28:54.400
Do y'all do the typewriter

28:54.400 --> 28:56.480
or are you doing a circle around the corn

28:56.480 --> 28:58.480
and then move to the next circle?

28:58.480 --> 28:59.920
Which way do you guys do it?

28:59.920 --> 29:04.400
I just, I just, I shuck it with my fate.

29:04.400 --> 29:05.120
What are you talking?

29:05.120 --> 29:06.560
I just told you how I did it.

29:07.280 --> 29:08.080
No, I mean now

29:08.080 --> 29:10.320
without the professional tooth reversal surgery.

29:12.560 --> 29:14.880
You do the typewriter like they do in them cartoons?

29:15.440 --> 29:18.000
I'm actually a fan of doing cut sees off sees.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
And I don't fuck with that in between the teeth stuff.

29:23.200 --> 29:24.320
Get that out of there.

29:24.320 --> 29:25.440
Cause I want corn now.

29:25.440 --> 29:27.360
I don't want corn tomorrow.

29:27.360 --> 29:28.240
But what, okay.

29:28.240 --> 29:30.960
Hypothetically you go to like visit a friend's house

29:30.960 --> 29:32.320
and they're very strict

29:32.320 --> 29:34.400
that you can not cut the corn off the cob.

29:35.040 --> 29:37.760
It's a very fundamentalist corn household

29:37.760 --> 29:40.400
and you have to eat it on the corn, on the cob.

29:40.400 --> 29:42.160
Do you do typewriter or do you do around the cob?

29:42.160 --> 29:43.520
Okay, so in this situation

29:43.520 --> 29:45.120
where this has happened to me once

29:45.120 --> 29:46.960
cause it'll never happen to me a second time.

29:46.960 --> 29:48.080
I guarantee you that

29:48.080 --> 29:51.440
cause I'll never talk to any of the parties associated again.

29:53.120 --> 29:54.800
I guess I would typewriter it Trav.

29:54.800 --> 29:55.680
You caught me, okay?

29:55.680 --> 29:56.640
That's the correct answer.

29:56.640 --> 29:57.520
You did good Griffin.

29:57.520 --> 29:58.560
I mean, it's not.

29:58.560 --> 30:00.480
Given the circumstance that you've laid out at it,

30:00.480 --> 30:02.400
I get it is the correct answer, I guess.

30:02.400 --> 30:04.320
I like this big hunky chunky bites.

30:05.280 --> 30:07.680
Man, can I just also say this aside?

30:07.680 --> 30:08.800
Fuck, this is funny.

30:08.800 --> 30:13.600
I can talk about how we like to eat corn for hours.

30:14.160 --> 30:15.840
But unfortunately we have to go to the muddies then.

30:15.840 --> 30:30.480
My brother, my brother and me is sponsored this week by Squarespace.

30:30.480 --> 30:33.120
If you would like to make a website all about eating corn,

30:33.120 --> 30:36.880
the funniest thing anyone could ever talk about ever.

30:37.520 --> 30:40.160
I think we can all agree that you want to use Squarespace.

30:40.160 --> 30:41.520
My brother, my brother and me is brought to you

30:41.520 --> 30:44.960
in part by Squarespace, the all-in-one website platform.

30:44.960 --> 30:46.720
Squarespace sites look professionally designed

30:46.720 --> 30:49.920
regardless of your skill level and with no coding required.

30:49.920 --> 30:51.040
Anybody can do this.

30:51.920 --> 30:52.800
Anybody.

30:52.800 --> 30:53.920
Name somebody right now.

30:53.920 --> 30:54.960
Justin, name somebody.

30:55.520 --> 30:56.640
My baby Charlie.

30:56.640 --> 30:57.360
She could do it.

30:57.360 --> 30:58.480
Griffin, name somebody.

31:01.520 --> 31:02.080
Anybody.

31:02.720 --> 31:04.240
Fucking Ron Perlman, I guess.

31:04.800 --> 31:05.680
He could do it.

31:05.680 --> 31:06.960
Justin, name somebody else.

31:08.080 --> 31:09.120
Ron Perlman?

31:09.120 --> 31:10.480
Oh no, he can't do it.

31:10.480 --> 31:11.120
Junior.

31:11.120 --> 31:12.640
Oh yes, he can do it.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.000
Okay, good.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.920
Don Perlman.

31:16.880 --> 31:18.800
He is allowed to do it, but only once.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.240
He can't do it, actually, that's the trick.

31:20.240 --> 31:25.600
His flesh is made out of hardened white precious gems.

31:25.600 --> 31:26.160
Oh, you got me.

31:26.160 --> 31:27.760
Bull from night court, bull from night court,

31:27.760 --> 31:28.720
bull from night court.

31:28.720 --> 31:29.440
He can do it.

31:29.440 --> 31:30.000
That's my next three.

31:30.000 --> 31:30.800
That's my next three.

31:30.800 --> 31:31.840
I want to get him out ahead of me.

31:31.840 --> 31:34.240
Oh, yes, no, yes.

31:35.040 --> 31:36.480
Griffin, one more.

31:36.480 --> 31:37.440
Dr. Pizza.

31:38.240 --> 31:39.840
Dr. Pizza could do it.

31:39.840 --> 31:40.560
Anybody could do it.

31:40.560 --> 31:42.960
I forgot, I ran out of people, okay?

31:42.960 --> 31:45.600
You did fine, and here's the best thing.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.760

32:00.880 --> 32:01.760
Anybody could do it.

32:02.880 --> 32:05.440
Even Dr. Pizza could do it, and he's not even real.

32:05.440 --> 32:07.600
Squarespace, Billy Beautiful.

32:07.600 --> 32:08.400
Excuse me?

32:09.040 --> 32:10.640
Sorry, he's not a real doctor.

32:10.640 --> 32:12.960
He's more like a professor.

32:12.960 --> 32:14.000
Professor Pizza.

32:14.000 --> 32:14.480
Thank you.

32:16.640 --> 32:18.960
I have a message here, and it's for Cupcake,

32:18.960 --> 32:22.960
AKA Kim, and it's from Muffin, AKA Joe.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.640
And Muffin says to Cupcake,

32:26.640 --> 32:28.560
happy fourth anniversary to the woman

32:28.560 --> 32:30.640
with hopefully infinite patience.

32:31.360 --> 32:33.040
You're an amazing mother and wife

32:33.040 --> 32:34.320
and the love of my life.

32:34.320 --> 32:35.920
PS, ramblesnatch.

32:35.920 --> 32:44.080
Was that one of the names for Warrior Cat,

32:44.080 --> 32:47.760
or is that a private, personal, maybe sexy message?

32:48.880 --> 32:49.920
It's not that sexy.

32:50.720 --> 32:53.280
Participated in something private and personal and sexy.

32:53.280 --> 32:54.720
Well, they made me do it.

32:54.720 --> 32:56.160
I can't feel guilty about,

32:56.160 --> 32:59.680
like they left their bedroom door open, you know?

32:59.680 --> 33:03.040
And they played soothing music inside.

33:03.040 --> 33:03.840
What am I supposed to do?

33:03.840 --> 33:05.040
What am I supposed to do?

33:05.040 --> 33:07.760
This message says it's for the week of November 12th.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.080
Oh my God, we did it.

33:10.080 --> 33:10.960
That's a third.

33:10.960 --> 33:11.840
First off, we did it.

33:11.840 --> 33:13.760
Secondly, that's a Thursday.

33:13.760 --> 33:15.200
What are you doing?

33:15.200 --> 33:16.800
How are you splitting up your weeks?

33:17.360 --> 33:19.440
Thursday's a special day of the week.

33:19.440 --> 33:21.120
I'm, I'm, I don't want to,

33:21.120 --> 33:24.400
I feel gross actually talking about this,

33:24.400 --> 33:26.480
this bedroom situation anymore.

33:26.480 --> 33:28.560
Griffin, tell us more about what Cupcake and Muffin

33:28.560 --> 33:30.000
do on Thursdays.

33:30.000 --> 33:34.080
They get stale because they were baked on a Monday.

33:34.080 --> 33:36.320
I got a message for James from Will.

33:38.880 --> 33:43.040
Hey big bro, here's wishing you a happy big 29 from me,

33:43.040 --> 33:45.840
the guy that always beat you at Settlers of Catan.

33:45.840 --> 33:49.520
I hope the final year of your 20s is filled with fun, laughter,

33:49.520 --> 33:51.200
and gunny?

33:52.400 --> 33:54.000
I don't know what that means.

33:54.000 --> 33:54.640
Oh man.

33:54.640 --> 33:55.840
I bet it's dirty too.

33:56.560 --> 33:57.680
Probably not dirty.

33:57.680 --> 33:58.000
Probably not.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.200
It probably is dirty.

33:59.200 --> 34:02.480
Sorry, sorry for eating your cherry flapjack.

34:02.480 --> 34:02.960
My bad.

34:05.120 --> 34:06.960
That is a true crime.

34:06.960 --> 34:10.400
I don't, I would love, I would just adore.

34:11.040 --> 34:14.240
I would just really fancy a cherry flapjack right now.

34:14.240 --> 34:15.680
That goes down really good.

34:15.680 --> 34:17.520
You know what I would kill for right now?

34:18.160 --> 34:18.560
What?

34:18.560 --> 34:21.760
Some, some motherfucking corn on the cob.

34:21.760 --> 34:22.000
Right?

34:23.760 --> 34:26.480
I want to kill, corn on the cob is basically

34:26.480 --> 34:29.120
a Japanese capsule hotel for corn.

34:29.120 --> 34:32.320
And I want to get in there like, like Bahamut

34:32.320 --> 34:35.840
and just destroy the whole foundation of the thing.

34:36.560 --> 34:37.200
You know what I mean?

34:38.000 --> 34:38.960
I do.

34:38.960 --> 34:40.080
I really do.

34:40.080 --> 34:44.640
I want to get that sloppy corn butter chin that you can only get

34:44.640 --> 34:47.680
from a true full blown cob devastator.

34:48.800 --> 34:50.320
I'd also like a corn fritter.

34:50.320 --> 34:51.120
Yeah, whatever.

34:51.120 --> 34:55.840
Oh, do you guys ever do, so welcome to Corncast.

34:55.840 --> 35:00.560
Did you guys realize why this episode is not one of our best?

35:00.560 --> 35:01.440
I just realized it.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.640
Friday the 13th.

35:04.640 --> 35:06.320
It's, we've been cursed.

35:06.320 --> 35:08.880
It's our first ever Friday the 13th recording, I think.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.720
Well, um, boo.

35:13.360 --> 35:15.840
Um, I'm Jason.

35:17.440 --> 35:19.040
Hey everyone, we're the Flophouse.

35:19.040 --> 35:22.800
One of the newest additions to the Maximum Fun Podcasting Network.

35:22.800 --> 35:24.080
I'm Dan McCoy.

35:24.080 --> 35:25.280
I'm Stuart Wellington.

35:25.280 --> 35:26.800
And I'm Elliot Kalin.

35:26.800 --> 35:28.080
What is the Flophouse?

35:28.080 --> 35:29.520
You may very well ask.

35:29.520 --> 35:31.760
We watch a bad movie and then we talk about it.

35:31.760 --> 35:33.040
A bad movie podcast?

35:33.040 --> 35:35.600
Isn't that like every fifth podcast on the internet?

35:35.600 --> 35:39.280
I'd answer that by saying one, we've been doing this show for over seven years,

35:39.280 --> 35:42.400
long before the entire premise of our show was a cliche.

35:42.400 --> 35:43.920
And two, shut up.

35:43.920 --> 35:45.040
Sick bird.

35:45.040 --> 35:47.760
I'd say that our show is more of a comedy podcast.

35:47.760 --> 35:50.160
A podcast about words that sound like other words.

35:50.160 --> 35:54.880
A podcast about me singing long irritating songs like this one.

35:54.880 --> 35:57.840
A podcast about pitches for a Ziggy comic book movie

35:57.840 --> 36:00.000
or discussions about sex tarps.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.520
Yeah, I mean, mostly it's a show about three friends just hanging out

36:04.080 --> 36:05.600
and talking about ding dongs.

36:05.600 --> 36:06.640
That's mostly used to.

36:06.640 --> 36:07.520
Wait, what?

36:07.520 --> 36:11.200
So if you like any of those things, subscribe in iTunes today

36:11.200 --> 36:15.280

36:15.280 --> 36:16.720
The Flophouse.

36:16.720 --> 36:17.840
That's what happens now.

36:18.400 --> 36:19.360
You read a question.

36:20.240 --> 36:21.440
Okay, all right.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.120
Kind of pump the brakes there.

36:23.120 --> 36:26.240
You asked.

36:26.240 --> 36:29.360
I currently work as the graphic and web designer for a small company

36:29.360 --> 36:31.600
and the nature of my work requires to bring me...

36:32.320 --> 36:32.820
Fuck.

36:34.560 --> 36:35.760
Friday the 13th.

36:35.760 --> 36:36.560
Got me again.

36:36.560 --> 36:37.120
Again.

36:37.680 --> 36:38.560
Oh, those tricky...

36:38.560 --> 36:39.200
Jason.

36:39.200 --> 36:40.880
Those tricky Jasons.

36:40.880 --> 36:43.680
They sneak in and they make it twist your words.

36:45.280 --> 36:47.920
It requires me to bring my laptop into the office.

36:47.920 --> 36:50.000
I love the job except for the fact

36:50.000 --> 36:52.960
my very hands-on boss keeps poking and touching my screen.

36:52.960 --> 36:56.640
Oftentimes hard enough to make me worry about the safety of my computer.

36:56.640 --> 36:59.280
Is there a way for me to get him to stop it

36:59.280 --> 37:03.440
and to keep my job that's from smudgy screen in SoCal?

37:07.040 --> 37:07.760
I'm sorry.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.400
Now, Griffin, why is this tickled you so much?

37:10.400 --> 37:10.960
It tickled me.

37:10.960 --> 37:12.160
Imagine it.

37:12.160 --> 37:12.960
Imagine it.

37:12.960 --> 37:13.600
Oh, let me see.

37:13.600 --> 37:14.560
What are you working on here?

37:17.600 --> 37:18.400
Jab, jab, jab.

37:18.400 --> 37:19.040
Jab, jab, squeeze.

37:19.040 --> 37:22.800
Oh, I like this graph here and I like how it goes up.

37:22.800 --> 37:23.360
What have you done?

37:23.360 --> 37:26.240
Oh, you've done a bar graph with a bar here, here, here.

37:26.240 --> 37:26.800
Oh, yeah.

37:28.720 --> 37:29.840
Hey, what does this button do?

37:30.960 --> 37:32.800
Do you want some of my PB&J?

37:32.800 --> 37:33.200
No?

37:33.200 --> 37:33.520
All right.

37:33.520 --> 37:34.240
All right.

37:34.240 --> 37:34.720
More for me.

37:37.440 --> 37:39.120
What is this new search engine you're using?

37:39.120 --> 37:40.960
Splorch, splorch, splorch.

37:40.960 --> 37:42.640
Like, what is this guy's deal?

37:44.240 --> 37:46.400
It's called splorch.com.

37:46.400 --> 37:47.200
Hey, can we get that?

37:47.200 --> 37:48.480
Can we get splorch.com?

37:48.480 --> 37:49.440
You already did.

37:49.440 --> 37:49.920
Damn it.

37:52.560 --> 37:59.760
I have one foolproof plan that is going to keep your bosses going to fall for it once,

37:59.760 --> 38:02.320
and then your problems will be over.

38:04.320 --> 38:05.760
Put some jelly on.

38:05.760 --> 38:06.880
Yeah, I figured that might be-

38:06.880 --> 38:12.000
You put some jelly right on your computer and the boss goes in for a touch of whiskey

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
and he comes back with a finger full of strawberry preserves,

38:16.000 --> 38:20.320
I guarantee your problems are going to be whisked away like you're on a carnival cruise

38:20.320 --> 38:22.640
line sailing off to the Bahamas.

38:22.640 --> 38:28.720
Now, Justin, I'm sorry, but how does that stop the screen from getting smudgy and dirty

38:28.720 --> 38:30.960
when it's covered in preserves?

38:30.960 --> 38:34.000
Now listen, because now you got ants, but the-

38:34.000 --> 38:37.520
And those helpful ants are going to clean that screen right off.

38:38.080 --> 38:40.720
They won't leave a fleck of jam on there.

38:41.600 --> 38:43.280
Hey, is this the IT department?

38:43.280 --> 38:43.920
Yeah.

38:43.920 --> 38:46.160
Is it normal for my computer to have some bugs?

38:47.200 --> 38:47.760
Yeah, it is.

38:47.760 --> 38:48.960
Just break down and fix it.

38:48.960 --> 38:49.600
Fuck yeah.

38:49.600 --> 38:51.520
Oh, you nerds, I recorded that.

38:51.520 --> 38:56.400
Now, nobody can get me fired for this now.

38:57.840 --> 39:03.120
Have you seen that hot new viral video Guy Punk's IT department with bug pun?

39:05.280 --> 39:06.720
It's got four views.

39:07.440 --> 39:08.560
It's pretty sick.

39:08.560 --> 39:09.440
You guys want a Yahoo?

39:10.320 --> 39:12.560
That didn't really answer the question, Jelly.

39:12.560 --> 39:15.520
Well, it's just the craziest thing I've probably ever heard.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.520
Why is this man touching your screen so much?

39:17.520 --> 39:20.320
Does he know there's little LCD diodes in there?

39:20.960 --> 39:22.320
They don't like being touched.

39:22.320 --> 39:23.120
Give them their space.

39:26.240 --> 39:27.120
Ask him not to.

39:27.840 --> 39:28.720
Just ask him not.

39:29.680 --> 39:39.600
Or maybe, is there a way you can make him feel like good about himself while asking him to stop?

39:39.600 --> 39:42.000
Like, whoa, Hercules.

39:42.000 --> 39:48.000
You're gonna break my liquid crystals with your big muscles there.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.680
You better pump the brakes.

39:49.680 --> 39:50.480
I have an idea.

39:52.080 --> 39:53.120
Here's what you do.

39:53.120 --> 39:57.680
Have ready, right, a little bottle of spray and like a screen cleaning wipe, right?

39:57.680 --> 40:01.680
And when you see him coming, start cleaning your screen.

40:02.880 --> 40:04.880
And when he walks up, you look at him and say,

40:04.880 --> 40:06.560
just trying to keep my screen clean.

40:06.560 --> 40:12.720
And then you're done, and he's there, and he's just seeing you trying to clean it, right?

40:13.680 --> 40:16.560
I think that that will be enough to keep his fingers off of your screen.

40:17.200 --> 40:21.840
Unless he's like, oh, you got rid of my good oily work that I did on my last-

40:21.840 --> 40:23.840
I drew a line for you to follow.

40:23.840 --> 40:24.560
Don't you understand?

40:24.560 --> 40:27.680
I said I wanted the line graph to go like here up to here.

40:28.320 --> 40:29.840
Stop, stop erasing it.

40:30.560 --> 40:33.520
Hey, stop cleaning your screen or you're fucking fired.

40:33.520 --> 40:36.480
You're a dime a dozen.

40:36.480 --> 40:37.920
Let my grease do the work.

40:38.480 --> 40:39.440
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

40:40.320 --> 40:40.640
Yes.

40:40.640 --> 40:41.600
Yeah, absolutely.

40:42.720 --> 40:45.840
This Yahoo was sent in by level 9000 Yahoo Drew, Drew Davenport.

40:45.840 --> 40:46.320
Thank you, Drew.

40:46.320 --> 40:47.680
It's by an anonymous user.

40:47.680 --> 40:53.120
I'm gonna call him Big Joan because Big Joan is the only person that has answered this anonymous user.

40:53.120 --> 40:54.080
Big Joan asks-

40:54.080 --> 40:54.800
Perfect.

40:54.800 --> 40:59.360
What is Lizard Man's relationship to this human world?

40:59.360 --> 41:03.040
What does it mean if you are a Lizard Man in a former life?

41:04.160 --> 41:04.720
What?

41:06.160 --> 41:10.480
Okay, what- Griffin, what- what in there is capitalized?

41:10.480 --> 41:11.520
You think that's gonna help?

41:11.520 --> 41:12.000
Syntax?

41:12.000 --> 41:12.560
I don't know.

41:12.560 --> 41:14.240
I'm looking for any clues.

41:14.240 --> 41:15.680
W, the W in what?

41:15.680 --> 41:16.400
That's it.

41:16.400 --> 41:16.880
Proper.

41:16.880 --> 41:18.720
Lizard Man's not, former life's not?

41:18.720 --> 41:19.220
No.

41:20.080 --> 41:20.800
God damn it.

41:21.680 --> 41:22.880
What is-

41:22.880 --> 41:23.760
Lizard Man's relationship-

41:23.760 --> 41:24.240
One more time.

41:24.240 --> 41:26.400
What is Lizard Man's relationship to this human world?

41:27.760 --> 41:28.880
God damn it.

41:28.880 --> 41:31.520
God, do you think this is Lizard Man asking that?

41:32.320 --> 41:33.840
Oh, that's grim.

41:33.840 --> 41:35.280
Poor Lizard Man.

41:35.280 --> 41:37.520
He's having a rough ride on the 13th too, huh?

41:37.520 --> 41:40.640
What am Lizard Man doing in this human world?

41:40.640 --> 41:42.640
Why can't Lizard Man find love?

41:42.640 --> 41:45.600
Lizard Man keeps saying wrong words on podcast.

41:47.360 --> 41:50.000
Lizard Man am bad at recorded medium.

41:50.000 --> 41:55.040
Podcast no be viral hit that Lizard Man expects to be.

41:55.040 --> 42:00.240
Lizard Man have unique thoughts and opinions that Lizard Man thought would get chuckle from others.

42:00.240 --> 42:05.680
Plain fleshy human ears no interested in hearing Lizard Man's unique perspective.

42:06.640 --> 42:09.200
Lizard Man have small but deep audience.

42:10.400 --> 42:14.400
Lizard Man thought audience would be more permissive of audio issues early on.

42:18.160 --> 42:20.320
Lizard Man can't get hashtag going.

42:20.320 --> 42:23.440
Why no one use hashtag for Lizard Man's show?

42:23.440 --> 42:28.240
Lizard Man's special guest appearance by Adam Carolla fall through last minute.

42:31.760 --> 42:34.560
Lizard Man mourn for opportunities lost.

42:36.320 --> 42:39.520
Lizard Man's sponsor's very disappointed in Lizard Man.

42:41.520 --> 42:43.600
Lizard Man know how sponsors.

42:43.600 --> 42:45.440
Lizard Man sorry about lies.

42:45.440 --> 42:47.120
Lizard Man sorry about lies.

42:50.320 --> 42:51.120
Oh god.

42:52.560 --> 42:55.600
Could be Lizard Man's inconsistent release schedule?

42:56.320 --> 42:57.040
Potentially.

42:58.080 --> 42:58.720
Potentially.

42:58.720 --> 42:59.760
It's all about consistency.

42:59.760 --> 43:02.800
That's why we're recording fucking today instead of skipping a week.

43:02.800 --> 43:05.760
Even though we're recording on the spookiest unluckiest day of the year.

43:05.760 --> 43:10.240
In hindsight, Lizard Man should not have called his podcast This American Life 2.

43:11.280 --> 43:12.640
The Lizard Man story.

43:12.640 --> 43:13.840
The Lizard Man story.

43:13.840 --> 43:17.120
The Lizard Man should have called this show for Lizard Man only.

43:17.120 --> 43:18.640
Such a narrow audience.

43:18.640 --> 43:19.120
Just me.

43:20.880 --> 43:24.080
Would also include Lizard Women if could find any.

43:25.520 --> 43:26.800
It's so hard out there.

43:27.360 --> 43:29.120
It's so hard out there for a Lizard Man.

43:29.920 --> 43:30.800
Ah man.

43:30.800 --> 43:36.640
Um what uh what uh what would you guys say to uh another question?

43:36.640 --> 43:37.440
How would that grab you?

43:37.440 --> 43:38.800
How would Lizard Man feel about that?

43:38.800 --> 43:39.280
It would grab me good.

43:39.280 --> 43:40.640
Lizard Man like questions.

43:40.640 --> 43:43.840
I'm 33 years old and my parents don't know that I have tattoos.

43:43.840 --> 43:45.760
I used to have a negative relationship with them.

43:45.760 --> 43:46.560
Yeah.

43:46.560 --> 43:48.240
I used to have a negative relationship with them.

43:48.240 --> 43:51.440
So when I started getting tattoos at the age of 18 I kept it a secret.

43:51.440 --> 43:54.560
By now we have worked on things and have a good relationship.

43:54.560 --> 43:59.200
But I've been lying to them for 15 years now about the fact that I have tattoos.

43:59.200 --> 44:01.520
I want to get more in places that'll be harder to keep hidden.

44:01.520 --> 44:03.920
How do I let my family know I have tattoos?

44:03.920 --> 44:07.680
I already know they have a problem with them in general for religious reasons.

44:08.560 --> 44:10.560
That's from Girl With The Secret Tattoos.

44:10.560 --> 44:17.760
Um I the one thing that struck me about this is odd is the line um uh I've been lying to

44:17.760 --> 44:20.480
them for 15 years now about the fact that I have tattoos.

44:20.480 --> 44:22.400
You think that's a lie about a mission?

44:22.400 --> 44:27.760
Not like she goes out of her way to say she doesn't go out of her way to say I uh anybody

44:27.760 --> 44:28.960
got any tattoos in this room?

44:28.960 --> 44:29.600
Not me.

44:29.600 --> 44:30.400
No me neither.

44:30.400 --> 44:30.880
No absolutely not you.

44:30.880 --> 44:34.240
Every time she shows up for Thanksgiving you don't have any tattoos do you?

44:34.240 --> 44:35.120
No still don't.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.440
Everything's cool where's the stuffing?

44:37.440 --> 44:42.640
But she she has missed by my math 15 consecutive Labor Day pool parties.

44:44.480 --> 44:45.920
Oh that's a good point.

44:45.920 --> 44:48.640
There's a lot of reasons why you're you're tattooed.

44:48.640 --> 44:49.520
What if it's her face?

44:49.520 --> 44:50.960
What if she's got the face tattoos?

44:52.000 --> 44:57.520
Well she says she wants to get them in places that are uh harder to conceal so I I can't

44:57.520 --> 44:59.840
think of many more places that are harder than that.

44:59.840 --> 45:04.080
I can't convince my family I'm just a huge fan of fan of the opera for much longer.

45:04.080 --> 45:11.760
Or I could you could you maybe try this your parents are like hey is that a Taz tattoo

45:11.760 --> 45:12.240
on your back?

45:12.800 --> 45:17.760
And you just like spin around and like whoa how'd that get there?

45:17.760 --> 45:22.000
What the hell I I've been targeted by a tattoo you know.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.440
They got me again.

45:23.440 --> 45:24.320
They got me again.

45:24.880 --> 45:28.320
What if you just acted like you had already told them?

45:28.320 --> 45:30.320
I told you about my Taz tattoo.

45:30.320 --> 45:34.560
Yeah you guys you've known about I I told you about it remember?

45:34.560 --> 45:36.640
Yeah it was like eight years ago.

45:36.640 --> 45:37.440
Did you forget?

45:37.440 --> 45:37.840
Remember?

45:37.840 --> 45:39.520
And now ball's in the air court.

45:40.720 --> 45:44.800
I was originally gonna get one with him uh like doing his like twirl and he was gonna

45:44.800 --> 45:49.360
say like the world keeps on spinning baby or like Taz say the world keeps on spinning

45:49.360 --> 45:51.840
baby or something and and I just got the smaller one.

45:51.840 --> 45:53.200
I told you guys that we had the whole conversation.

45:53.200 --> 45:53.840
You remember.

45:53.840 --> 45:59.120
Because you said you were gonna get one too and then uh you didn't.

45:59.120 --> 46:04.800
We went and you chickened out at the last minute and then you got one later and you

46:04.800 --> 46:05.600
got it removed.

46:05.600 --> 46:06.640
How do you not remember this?

46:06.640 --> 46:07.760
You remember.

46:10.560 --> 46:12.320
What if you got Taz praying?

46:12.880 --> 46:15.360
That would be amazing probably.

46:16.000 --> 46:20.160
And so then they were like a tattoo and you're like yeah but look closer and they're like

46:20.160 --> 46:20.720
oh okay.

46:20.720 --> 46:22.000
No that's kind of nice.

46:22.000 --> 46:26.560
That's nice and they got another one of Taz peeing on something like that Calvin kid.

46:26.560 --> 46:28.640
Yeah he's peeing on the devil.

46:28.640 --> 46:33.040
Yeah you guys uh remember when Taz was like big for a minute right?

46:33.600 --> 46:34.000
Yeah.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.160
I was thinking I was thinking about this yesterday.

46:36.720 --> 46:42.800
Do you think that was you also remember the when Tweety Bird was kind of like in vogue

46:42.800 --> 46:43.360
right?

46:43.360 --> 46:44.960
Like a little bit before that.

46:44.960 --> 46:49.200
Do you all because I was trying to puzzle out why anybody would have any affinity for

46:49.200 --> 46:55.040
Taz the character the Tasmanian devil and I started to wonder do you think people who

46:55.040 --> 47:01.680
were super into Taz initially were doing it sort of like a rebellious flipping of the

47:01.680 --> 47:05.760
proverbial bird to people who are really into Tweety?

47:05.760 --> 47:07.440
Like that's not for me.

47:07.440 --> 47:14.480
I'm a grown adult with I'm a bad girl or boy uh I'm a I'm more of a Taz person myself.

47:14.480 --> 47:16.880
Tweety Tweety has no sway over me.

47:16.880 --> 47:18.800
Um yes?

47:18.800 --> 47:22.160
You're saying there were warring factions of Tweety and Taz.

47:22.160 --> 47:28.080
I'm saying that the original Taz's I'm wondering I'm not pausing this theory I'm

47:28.080 --> 47:34.800
wondering aloud if the original Taz's were seen by their users as like a uh a rebellion

47:34.800 --> 47:41.600
an act of rebellion an anti-establishment uh uh sort of symbol.

47:41.600 --> 47:45.520
But could you not flip that Justin and say that the Tweety Bird came out of people seeing

47:45.520 --> 47:50.160
the Taz and saying no I believe in a more structured society in which the good guy who

47:50.160 --> 47:55.200
wins and they're a little bit a little bit a little bit rambunctious but mostly there

47:55.200 --> 47:56.880
for good.

47:56.880 --> 48:04.000
Um okay that you would say I would say Taz is I would say Taz is chaotic good and well

48:04.000 --> 48:08.400
Justin I would say it depends on which Taz they're talking about.

48:08.400 --> 48:12.880
Are we talking about the Taz from like tiny tunes and later iterations or are we talking

48:12.880 --> 48:15.760
about the original Taz because the original Taz was the bad guy if I remember correctly.

48:15.760 --> 48:25.040
I got a monstrously explicit Marvin the Martian tattoo over my body it's a full body extremely

48:25.040 --> 48:30.400
explicit Marvin the Martian tattoo and when I say extremely explicit I'm talking about

48:30.400 --> 48:42.560
dick on dick like his on mine full-blown full tattoo suit uh-huh yeah right we I remember

48:42.560 --> 48:46.880
last Christmas as well as anybody what the what else do you have to add nothing that

48:46.880 --> 48:51.360
was a great gift that you all got for me that you all chipped in it's a very expensive

48:51.360 --> 49:00.000
procedure getting a full martian body transplant but uh it was worth it that was him of course

49:00.000 --> 49:05.760
that was a classic character an impersonation of his favorite character Marvin the Martian

49:05.760 --> 49:10.960
yeah I actually you know what's fucked I'm kind of over him now a little bit that's

49:10.960 --> 49:15.120
too bad that's that's a shame you hate to hear that everybody this has been my brother

49:15.120 --> 49:20.640
my brother and me it's been an advice show for the modern era uh uh uh we've been recording

49:20.640 --> 49:25.440

49:25.440 --> 49:33.760
