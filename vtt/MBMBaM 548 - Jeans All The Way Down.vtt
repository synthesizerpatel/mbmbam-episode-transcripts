00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Here come the McElroys, we've got jokes and bits.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
We're gonna give advice and do funny skits, laughter it is in store.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Come inside and see, it's time to start.

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
It's my brother, my brother and me.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
Hey everybody, welcome to my brother, my brother, mean advice show for the modern era.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
I'm your middlest brother, the old spotty dog, Travis McElroy.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
It kind of fucked me up that you said hey and not hello, which is...

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Yeah, I've never said hey, it felt casual.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
It felt like we were on Twitch or something more casual than...

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Like a TGI Friday.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Hey guys.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Yeah, hey guys.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Don't forget to like and subscribe.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Yeah.

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
I've been working on some songs during quarantine, and I finished one up just recently.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
All right.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
And I wanted to see what you guys thought.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Now, what kind of songs are you talking about?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Like what genre?

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
What kind of song is it?

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
It's just one song.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
It's just one song.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
But you said plural.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
I mean, you said plural.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Does it play an instrument?

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
No, there's no instruments on it.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
It's acapella.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Okay.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Okay.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Can I sing it?

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
And please don't interrupt me or anything while I'm singing it, okay?

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
And it's just a song.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
How will we know when the song's over and we can start talking?

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
There's like one whole rest.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
So if it goes longer than a whole rest.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Okay.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Okay.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Okay.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Okay.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Here's the song.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
And your brothers will never know that you're eating chili while you record.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
No, that's a secret you'll take to your grave.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
Now your brothers will never know all the beef and beans you're shoving in your gourd.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
They'd prefer it if you would just behave.

02:11.000 --> 02:30.000
It is Thursday at 2.41 p.m. and this is happening in real life on the cilantro sprinkled across the bowl that was chopped up recently by your wife.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Okay.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
What do you guys think so far?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
That's verse one.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Now.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Oh, it's not.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
There's more to it than that?

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
That's just the beginning.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
I wanted to stop for notes.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Now, let me say this.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Uh-huh.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
It's 2.41 p.m. now.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Yeah.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
It's 2.42 according to the clock at this point.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Well, that's not my point, Justin.

02:47.000 --> 02:54.000
I think what you were hoping or maybe anticipating here was that we would be upset that you're eating chili during recording.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
I'm upset that you're eating lunch at almost 3 p.m.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Okay.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Well, it is just a...

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
I feel like I clarified at the beginning is just a song.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
It's a song, Travis.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
It's just a song.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Well...

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
It's like the...

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
It's like confessional standup.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
It doesn't always...

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
It's not describing what's happening right now.

03:13.000 --> 03:20.000
It could be a recording that he did, you know, a couple months back at 2.41 p.m. now, 2.42 p.m. on Thursday.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
Yeah, but there were a lot of specifics in there, Griffin.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
And at one point, I believe he said, this is happening right now.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Right.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
But that's in the...

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
That was...

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Did you hear that that was part of the song?

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Yeah.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
We've done this 560 episodes.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
We've done it 560 times.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
Like, odds are we have recorded on a Thursday at 2.41, now 2.42 p.m.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Can I just...

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Can I just continue?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Yeah, sorry.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Thank you.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Go ahead.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
And the spoon is literally in my hand.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
Me, Justin McElroy, the person singing this song.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
And it's not just a song.

03:57.000 --> 04:04.000
It's a story about me eating chili while I record the show.

04:04.000 --> 04:10.000
My brother, my brother and me, this episode right now.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Now that's...

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
Okay, Griffin, you have to admit that that seems suspicious, right?

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
It could have described any episode.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
He said this episode right now.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
It's when he's singing it.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
It's just a song.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
No, you said in there that it's not just a song, Justin.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
No.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Okay, but that was in the song.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Who are you going to believe, Travis?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Our brother or the song?

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
I believe our brother.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
I believe our brother.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
No.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Okay.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
No.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
This song, he says in the song...

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
It's just a song.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
It's not just a song.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
You said in the song that it's not just a song.

04:43.000 --> 04:49.000
But I said in the song, if the song is just a song, you can't pick and choose what different parts you're going to listen to.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
You know what?

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
You're right.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
I can't decide you believe the part where I say it's not just a song.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
No, Justin, I believe all of it.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
This is the thing.

04:58.000 --> 05:08.000
I believe all of it from start to finish that you currently have a spoon in your hand that you're eating chili that your wife puts cilantro on that you're eating it right now as we record this episode.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Travis.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Travis.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
You're killing me, dude.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
It's just a song.

05:12.000 --> 05:18.000
And I would sign an affidavit with my legal name in front of a notary.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
Say hi to eating chili.

05:21.000 --> 05:31.000
But it will not come to that because my brothers will believe me when I say that this is just a song, even though it's not now.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
Oh, I was ready to buy in until that very last...

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Ooh, that very last kickflip there.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
What was different?

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Did you not like it different?

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
What part was different?

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Is it because it didn't rhyme?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
No.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
I was struggling with that.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
No, I'm fine with free verse.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
It's more that right there at the end you said it's not a song again.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Yeah.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Still not Jermaine, though.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
But it's very clearly not a song.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
Like if OJ Simpson put out a song like, I definitely did it, people would get suspicious.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
He realized that, right?

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Yeah.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Hmm.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
That's...

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
That's...

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
I mean, he did put out a book that was kind of like that.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Yeah.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
And he wasn't like, it was just a book.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Hey guys, it's just a book.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Weird co-winky dink.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
I ate leftover chili for lunch.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
What does that have to do with me?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Right before...

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Well, because that was the nature of the song.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
I'm not saying that that's what you did.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Oh, thank you.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Okay.

06:24.000 --> 06:31.000
But I washed it down with a probiotic soda that Rachel brought into our house.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
For some reason, it was a chunky soda.

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
And so my body's going to make something new.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
What are you guys doing to yourself?

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
I had a fruit smoothie for breakfast and then I had a nice salad.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
What's wrong with you two?

06:48.000 --> 06:54.000
I had some turkey and celery and hummus.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
And then chili.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
Yeah, I actually had a quinoa bowl trap from Panera Bread,

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
so I don't know what you're talking about.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
That thing I just said about the probiotic soda and the chili was a poem.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
No, it wasn't a poem.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
It was Robert Frost's poem about chili.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Oh, I actually remember that now that I know how you say it.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Yeah.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Yeah.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Yeah.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Fuck.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
Excuse me?

07:19.000 --> 07:26.000
My body dead ass feels quite bad.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
I'm actually weirdly pretty hungry because I meant to eat lunch before.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Yeah.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
I meant to eat lunch before we started recording and now I'm going to be hungry for the whole show.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Sure.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
I did recently do, not that I'm saying what you said is true, Justin,

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
but I did recently do a livestream game in which 30 seconds before it began,

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
my wife lovingly brought me a plate with two big pieces of pizza on it.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Oh, God, Justin.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
And then I had to eat it on the stream by ducking down below camera level,

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
taking a couple bites, chewing and eating, then raising back up.

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
Now, Justin, do you want to make any more horrific meat slapping sounds?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Guys, hold on one second.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Sydney's coming in.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
No.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Yeah, no, it was delicious.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Thank you.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
Yeah, the cilantro really, really helped.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Okay.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Now, Justin.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Probably just cut that.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
That was a skit.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Now, Justin.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
What's up?

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
You just said.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Tell him, Justin, it was a skit.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
She said, yes.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
I said what?

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
You said the cilantro was good and that was something.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
She suggested the line about cilantro.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Yeah.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
They're a comedy writing team and they're doing some sketches.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
We're basically a comedy writing team?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Yeah.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
You get it, Justin?

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Yeah.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
I'm not going to rest until I crack this.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Yeah.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
You can try it.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Whatever.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
You can't run from me, Justin.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
I will hunt you down like a dog and I'll prove you ate that chili during this recording.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
I don't think you ever will.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
Justin, I got a whole board set up on my wall already.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
I got strings running the things.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
The only...

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Now, listen, I'm looking at your board via Skype.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
No, that was just a poem.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
I don't have a board, Justin.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
It was just a poem.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
It wasn't a real board, Justin.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
Even if you did have a board, the only thing you could pin up there is that Justin repeatedly

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
stated that he ate chili during the recording.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Right.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
That's a bad board.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Can we do a...

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
This has been a bit the whole time, Justin.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I knew it was real and just a song at the same time.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
I don't even care.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
It was just a bit.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Yeah.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
What about a question?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
You know what I deserve for that?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
What?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
A Bitcoin.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Oh, I get it.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
Boy, I wish we got a coin for every bit we did.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
I think it'd go a little something like this.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Did I invent the term Bitcoin?

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
You did.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Bit?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Just now.

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
Did I coin Bitcoin bit?

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
It's just you're taking so long to get...

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
It's taking a really long time.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
You get mad at me for interrupting you, but everyone knew where you were going 30 seconds

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
before you said coin a Bitcoin Bitcoin coin.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Anticipation.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Okay.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
Now this first question is not one we normally do, but it was such...

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
It tickled my brain.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Are you going to read it?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
I love it.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
You do it.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
You should read it, but it's a good setup.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Who is the best farmer in the world?

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
You know how there's the best soccer player or basketball list in the world?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Who's the best farmer?

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Who has the most farmer stats?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
And that's from Gmail.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
And what I love about this question, and what it makes you think is, this is not saying

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
are there good farmers and bad farmers?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Because yes, of course it's true.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
But is there a best farmer?

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Huh.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Do you know how you know who the best farmer is?

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
How?

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
He's outstanding in his field.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Okay.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Huh.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
I didn't do this question just to set that up, but it popped in my head.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
All right.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
I liked it.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
I would say whichever farm has the most crows.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Oh, you think?

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
The crows have spoken.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
This farm is the best one.

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
It's got the best corn or grapes or whatever crows like to eat.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Probably corn.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
I think it's corn.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
I mean, it's Mr. Monsanto.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Yeah, I love that.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
In his many farms.

11:19.000 --> 11:26.000
What I like about this question, too, is it has a deeper implication that every job,

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
there is a best at it, right?

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Sure.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
Like that there is out there somewhere the world's best sanitation worker that can like

11:36.000 --> 11:42.000
pick up a garbage can and kind of do this scoop move that launches the bags 30 yards

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
into the truck without having to walk over there, right?

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
That everyone's like, oh, they're the best, right?

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Like that has to exist.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
There is a ticket taker somewhere that rips it right in the middle every time.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
You know what I mean?

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Right.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
There has to be a best.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
Someone has to be the best at it.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Yeah.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
And I feel like that's a dream that we all chase is being the best in whatever field

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
we're enthusiastic about.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
I feel like for a sanitation worker, it would be the robot arm that lifts up the can and

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
dumps it in and doesn't lose like a pizza box over the side or something like that.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Like maybe they were in the military.

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
They did one of those bomb exploding robots, and so they got good garbage arm training

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
for that.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
And now I'm writing a fucking Tom Clancy novel in our podcast.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
I do apologize for that.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
Is there something that you guys think you're the best at?

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
In the world?

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Yeah.

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
Like when everybody looks at the leaderboard right there at the top, you got most saying

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
the name of Justin McElroy or Griffin McElroy.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Hmm.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
No.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Wow.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
That's a deep dark.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
No.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
No.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Nothing.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
No.

12:53.000 --> 13:00.000
I'm the best at not remembering to get a napkin or paper towel when I get my food at a restaurant.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Oh, yeah.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
No, I've said that.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
I said that about you before.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Griffin, every time.

13:05.000 --> 13:11.000
I come back to the table with our food, and you guys are like, where's the napkins?

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
And I'm like, I did not get those.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
And then you always say to me, you're the best at that.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
You're the best at that.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
It's so consistent.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
You're the best at not getting those.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
That's probably up there for me.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Mm-hmm.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Mm-hmm.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Not the worst.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
I mean, there's less thing I'm not the worst at.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
You don't think there's anything you're not the worst at?

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
Because I would say, I'm not saying that about you.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
I think it's way easier to be the worst at something.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Oh, sure.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
You know?

13:38.000 --> 13:47.000
No, because you get to a base level where just lack of any experience is a great leveler.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
You know what I mean?

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Yeah.

13:49.000 --> 13:54.000
You could say worst stock trader, and you're going to hit a point of the population where

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
like, don't know, never looked into it, do not know about it, don't know what it is.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
And that's like a wide swath.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
You couldn't be the worst just because of your ignorance.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Yeah.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
There couldn't be one worst.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
I actually have bad news about this best farmer question.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
What's that?

14:09.000 --> 14:15.000
Well, I was thinking about it and how it's like all family farms, and it's like all huge

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
family farms over, and it's all just these big corpo farms.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Oh, yeah.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Oh, yeah.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
And then I started looking into it a little more, and here's what they don't want you

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
to know, guys.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
What's that?

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
There are no more farmers.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Oh.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Yeah.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
We actually don't have farmers anymore in America.

14:33.000 --> 14:40.000
A lot of it comes from China, and a lot of it comes from robotically run food farms that

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
are, but there's no farmers anymore.

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
If you're listening to this and you think that you're a farmer, someone's running the

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
long grift on you because we don't have them anymore.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Now, what about farmers only, Justin?

14:53.000 --> 14:58.000
That's why that crashed in the.com bubble of pets.com, farmersonly.com.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
I lost my fucking shirt when farmers only went under.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
Luckily, I had Christian Mingle there to kind of keep me afloat.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
Oh, I'm more of a plenty of fish guy, but yeah.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Hey, can I do a Yahoo?

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Yeah, I'd like that grift.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Thank you.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
This one was sent in by Amy.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Thanks, Amy.

15:14.000 --> 15:21.000
It's Yahoo Answers user Ray who asks, how do you become the guy who controls the family

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
dinner table?

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Oh.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
Like in the show Boardwalk Empire, Nucky Thompson?

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Is that-

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
That can't be it.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
I don't know if that's a typo.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
I'm Nucky.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
It was Nucky.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Welcome to-

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
That can't be it.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Time for me to-

15:34.000 --> 15:40.000
I'm assuming this is on some sort of like Boardwalk Empire-centric sub-Yahoo because

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
that is the only place that that program would be summoned up for polite discussion.

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
Without even knowing the rest of the question, Tony Soprano should be the reference, right?

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
Not Nucky Thompson.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
It's Nucky Thompson.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
I'm Nucky.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Thanks for enjoying the meatloaf today.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Nucky, can I ask a question?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
No.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
You can't.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
In the show Boardwalk Empire, Nucky Thompson is always the guy with the cool stories and

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
stuff to say at big family parties.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
I'd love to be like that.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
How do you become the guy who controls the family dinner table?

16:15.000 --> 16:20.000
Now, hold on though, because the question isn't about the person at the head of table

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
who everyone looks to.

16:22.000 --> 16:28.000
It's not a locational, it's not based on orientation.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
I mean, that's got to contribute to it somewhat, right?

16:31.000 --> 16:36.000
Well, if you want to be the story person though, you want to be in the middle of the table.

16:36.000 --> 16:41.000
Because you want to just look slightly to your left and right to be able to see everybody.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Yeah, I love that.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
Also, big hands, bigger the better.

16:46.000 --> 16:53.000
You think big hands helps you because everyone is kind of quietly, subconsciously threatened

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
by you?

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Or why the big hands?

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Oh, no, sorry.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
I meant big hand movements, not just like large hands.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Oh, he gesticulates.

17:00.000 --> 17:05.000
Okay, I thought you were saying large physical hands, and then I was like, maybe that's why

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
they call him Nucky Thompson, because his knuckles are so ginormous.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
Large hands does contribute well to large hand movements though, because you have to

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
do a lot less work to just like, now you've moved seven inches.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
Because the hands are so big, it doesn't take much.

17:21.000 --> 17:28.000
Does being the source of the food help you sort of seize the day here?

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Like if they're eating you?

17:30.000 --> 17:36.000
No, well, that would certainly be a topic of like a real starter, you know what I mean?

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
Oh, if they're like serving sushi off of you, you mean?

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
Oh, no, I thought you were saying like, we're eating Nucky's forearm today, and you would

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
kind of have to talk to Nucky about that.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Well, kind of both of those things, right?

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Kind of both.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
Because if you're eating sushi and you're just way too hungry and you get into it, you're

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
like, oh, God, I'm so sorry.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Why didn't you say something?

17:55.000 --> 18:03.000
If you let the sushi eat off a person's body, what's the etiquette for going for the pieces

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
on the privacy area?

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
That has to be less.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
You can't eat them first.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Yeah, 100%.

18:11.000 --> 18:16.000
Nipples, I think that that's a straight, I feel like when you pick up a little hamachi

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
off the nipple and then you find out the nipple's under there, you can plead ignorance a bit

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
and just be like, I didn't think the nipple would be fair.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
I would put it back, by the way.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
If I did that, I would just put the sushi back.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
No, if somebody saw you pick it up and put it back, the party would be over.

18:33.000 --> 18:39.000
You would be uninvited from all future nude sushi parties.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
I would let people eat sushi off my body if I was fully clothed.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
If I was wearing a suit, I'd put sushi on my sushi suit.

18:47.000 --> 18:53.000
I feel like it's just whoever is the most proactive, whoever sort of starts the conversations

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
and guides it.

18:56.000 --> 19:02.000
It's less about power and strength and being naked and having sushi on your body.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
You don't have to wrestle that away from anybody.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
I'll tell you who's good at dominating conversations, it's Justin.

19:10.000 --> 19:16.000
I'm going to show you guys, Justin's going to do a little practical example here for you.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
Griffin and I will have a conversation and Justin's going to come in and nucky all over it.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
You ready?

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Travis, did you watch the Blues game last night?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
I did.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Those coyotes are really giving them the run around, huh?

19:26.000 --> 19:31.000
Yeah, but they did some great scoring and shooting, and I like the way that one of them iced another one.

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
Yeah, I mean, Bennington's doing his best out there, but unless that defense solidifies,

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
they're not going to be able to keep it out of their zone, you know?

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
Yeah, and I was amazed at how many triple dekes they got away with, you know what I mean?

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
Yeah, those are the new hockey rules because of COVID regulations.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
There's the slap shot.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
It looks like Justin's trying to say something.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Justin, are you trying to say something?

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
Oh, so you finally ran out of steam.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
See, this is the secret.

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
You hang back and you let everybody else burn out.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
So anyways, yeah, the Blues game was great.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
And then you stand up and you take control of the table.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
You've had your shot.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
All the sushi fell off.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
We all heard how that worked out.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Don't stand up.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Don't you talk over me.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Don't you talk over – I smashed a bottle on your head.

20:15.000 --> 20:20.000
Roll dexterity saving throw.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
I got a 17 plus 3, a 20.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
You effortlessly duck out of the way.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
I attack Nucky.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Oh, hell yeah.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Get him.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Fuck him up.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
That's a 15 plus 2, a 17.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Does that beat your AC?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Did you use pure silver?

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Yes, of course.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
I'm not a noob.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Yes, I am defeated.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Okay.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
That's one way to do it.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
I guess I haven't watched enough Boardwalk Empire to be really useful here.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
No, that's basically how it goes.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
I guess.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
There was a lot of D&D influence on that show.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
There was also – it felt like a little Peaky Blinders in there, Justin.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Was there just a little Peaky Blinders?

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
I've watched even less.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Are those two different shows?

21:02.000 --> 21:08.000
It's like Boardwalk Empire and then Boardwalk Empire colon Peaky Blinders.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Okay, I see.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
I got another way to control the dinner table, the family dinner table.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
So why don't you two start?

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
I'm talking about something.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
Hey, Justin, did you see that new episode of Boardwalk Empire?

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
No, that hasn't been on for a really long time.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
No, they just started making more of them.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
I don't think that that's actually accurate.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Yeah, Tom Welling's in it.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Hey, get this.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
When I was recording my other member –

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Sorry, guys.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
I got a phone call.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Sorry, guys.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
I got a phone call.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Yeah.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
No, it's me.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Yeah, I can talk.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Yeah, we're having dinner.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Can you – sorry.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Sorry, one second.

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
Can you guys please just give me – can you please just give me a – this is really important.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Can you please just give me a second?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Okay, we'll just talk quietly.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
No, no, no.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Just don't talk.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Just don't talk.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Thank you.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
I'm back.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Thankfully, we know sign language.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Uh-huh.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Yeah.

21:55.000 --> 22:02.000
When I was recording my brother, my brother and me earlier this week, I was eating chili

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
during –

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
I fucking knew it.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
What?

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
I fucking knew it.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Yeah.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Yeah.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Well, this is just in the context of a bit.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
We'll tell them when 2024 runs around.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
Yeah, same thing.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Same thing.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Same thing.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
We'll talk about a run then.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Yeah.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
No, no.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
I'm killing Murphy.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Okay.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Give my love to Dennis Kucinich.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
All right.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Yeah.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Yeah.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Thanks.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
Bye.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
That was my – that's another phone call.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Sorry, guys.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
You're blowing up again, huh?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
Your real phone calls.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
That was when I'm a kid.

22:29.000 --> 22:43.000
I'm going to be Dennis Kucinich's campaign manager in 2024.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Oh, nice.

22:44.000 --> 22:49.040
Now, do I know who that is, or is it just a name that I pulled from the void that is

22:49.040 --> 22:50.040
my mom?

22:50.040 --> 22:51.040
Is it deeply problematic?

22:51.040 --> 22:52.040
Is he?

22:52.040 --> 22:53.040
I don't know.

22:53.040 --> 22:54.040
I literally don't know.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.040
Is he alive?

22:55.040 --> 22:56.040
I don't know.

22:56.040 --> 22:57.040
I don't know.

22:57.040 --> 22:58.040
Can I show one more way to kind of dominate?

22:58.040 --> 22:59.040
Yeah.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.040
Yeah.

23:00.040 --> 23:01.040
I would love that.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.040
This has been so good so far.

23:02.040 --> 23:03.040
Okay.

23:03.040 --> 23:04.040
You two have the conversation.

23:04.040 --> 23:05.040
Okay.

23:05.040 --> 23:06.040
Okay.

23:06.040 --> 23:07.040
Hey, thanks for having my back on the chili thing earlier.

23:07.040 --> 23:08.040
Yeah.

23:08.040 --> 23:09.040
It was my pleasure.

23:09.040 --> 23:10.040
I would do anything.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.040
Ahem.

23:11.040 --> 23:16.400
I will be turning in the coupon that you two gave me for my birthday for one half hour

23:16.400 --> 23:23.480
of uninterrupted monologue by me, and I will now be completely recapping the plot of the

23:23.480 --> 23:28.480
Brendan Fraser movie, Blast from the Past.

23:28.480 --> 23:29.480
Yeah.

23:29.480 --> 23:35.900
You see, it all began when Christopher Walken's character feared that there was going to be

23:35.900 --> 23:41.840
a nuclear attack, so he built a bunker in his basement.

23:41.840 --> 23:47.480
That bunker, it looked a lot like a house except underground, and there was raised-

23:47.480 --> 23:48.480
Why is he talking like this?

23:48.480 --> 23:53.600
A young Brendan Fraser, and then he became old, and he was sent out to the surface-

23:53.600 --> 23:56.640
Like, we just used our regular voices, but Travis is doing his weird-

23:56.640 --> 23:58.840
Where he befriended Alicia Silverstone.

23:58.840 --> 23:59.840
British affectation.

23:59.840 --> 24:02.320
And I believe Dave Foley.

24:02.320 --> 24:03.320
It's funny.

24:03.320 --> 24:06.320
I think if he knew the plot well enough, he'd go faster, right?

24:06.320 --> 24:07.320
Yeah.

24:07.320 --> 24:13.520
And then it turned out that because Brendan Fraser had been raised with 1950s and 60s

24:13.520 --> 24:22.440
ideals, everyone loved him, a thing which is demonstrably untrue in today's society.

24:22.440 --> 24:26.520
Let's do the money zone, maybe, while he continues to recap.

24:26.520 --> 24:27.520
I'd love that.

24:27.520 --> 24:28.520
Hey, thanks.

24:28.520 --> 24:29.520
I'd love that.

24:29.520 --> 24:46.800
I'd love that.

24:46.800 --> 24:52.000
We all shop online for stuff, shoes, for instance.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
What else?

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
What else?

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
Sandals.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.280
What else?

24:57.280 --> 24:58.760
Can you give me six more?

24:58.760 --> 25:05.800
Boots, Crocs, galoshes, and shoes, and sneakers.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.600
Yeah, put six.

25:07.600 --> 25:12.660
So you see that promo code field at checkout, and you're like, is there a way I could save

25:12.660 --> 25:14.440
money and not spend as much money?

25:14.440 --> 25:18.400
And the answer is honey, which rhymes with money, which is the mnemonic device I use

25:18.400 --> 25:19.400
for it.

25:19.400 --> 25:22.400
It's a free browser extension, and whenever you buy something that has one of those little

25:22.400 --> 25:25.960
coupon code fields, it scans the internet.

25:25.960 --> 25:29.400
It releases its little burr, its little sparrows.

25:29.400 --> 25:30.440
Or bees.

25:30.440 --> 25:31.440
It's little bees into the-

25:31.440 --> 25:33.100
You're not a fucking asshole.

25:33.100 --> 25:39.760
It releases its bees out into the internet and into everybody's phones, looking for coupon

25:39.760 --> 25:40.760
codes.

25:40.760 --> 25:41.760
Who's got the coupon codes?

25:41.760 --> 25:42.760
Who's got the coupon codes?

25:42.760 --> 25:48.600
And then the bees come back, and then honey tells you, and it's like, here's $33.

25:48.600 --> 25:50.840
So that's amazing.

25:50.840 --> 25:53.940
It's literally, everybody should be doing it.

25:53.940 --> 25:54.940
It's free.

25:54.940 --> 25:59.460
It sells in just a few seconds, and you can get honey for free at joinhoney.com slash

25:59.460 --> 26:00.520

26:00.520 --> 26:04.400
That's joinhoney.com slash brother.

26:04.400 --> 26:07.000
Have you guys ever eaten food for sustenance?

26:07.000 --> 26:09.520
No, let me do this ad.

26:09.520 --> 26:10.660
Okay.

26:10.660 --> 26:13.480
How good is Sun Basket?

26:13.480 --> 26:14.480
Very good.

26:14.480 --> 26:19.880
Sun Basket is a meal delivery service that has a wild variety of options for you to get

26:19.880 --> 26:21.040

26:21.040 --> 26:27.240
No matter how you're eating or what you like to eat, I truly believe that they are going

26:27.240 --> 26:34.000
to have a meal to suit your needs, and more importantly, your desires.

26:34.000 --> 26:39.240
Getting a meal on the table quickly doesn't mean you have to sacrifice nutrition or quality.

26:39.240 --> 26:43.760
With Sun Basket, you can actually have it all every single day.

26:43.760 --> 26:48.720
So they have the meal kit stuff, and there's a huge variety of those.

26:48.720 --> 26:53.120
What I love that I've just recently gotten into, they have these fresh and ready meals.

26:53.120 --> 26:58.960
They're $8.99, and they come, and you basically heat them up, and it's like a gourmet meal

26:58.960 --> 27:00.520
that you're just instantly enjoying.

27:00.520 --> 27:08.220
They have a chili that I just tried today, actually, earlier today, and it was so delicious

27:08.220 --> 27:13.480
earlier today and very recently, but earlier in this day we were in, and it was so delicious

27:13.480 --> 27:16.400
that I couldn't stop eating it no matter what.

27:16.400 --> 27:23.680
I would do anything, anything, to keep eating it no matter what the cost or the podcast,

27:23.680 --> 27:25.800
whatever was going on in my life.

27:25.800 --> 27:29.440
Even if it meant losing a relationship with one of your brothers.

27:29.440 --> 27:33.400
I don't remember exactly, Tri, but it was a very strong desire to keep eating the chili.

27:33.400 --> 27:34.440
I do remember that.

27:34.440 --> 27:40.560

Huh?

28:02.560 --> 28:06.760
I'm Judge John Hodgman.

28:06.760 --> 28:08.360
And I'm Bailiff Jesse Thorne.

28:08.360 --> 28:12.200
Ten years ago, I came on Jordan Jesse Go and judged my first dispute.

28:12.200 --> 28:14.000
Is chili a soup?

28:14.000 --> 28:15.560
It's a stew, obviously.

28:15.560 --> 28:19.360
The judge has dispensed a decade of justice.

28:19.360 --> 28:25.080
He's the one person wise enough to answer the really important questions like, should

28:25.080 --> 28:28.560
you hire a mime to perform at your own funeral?

28:28.560 --> 28:31.040
After they cry, I want them to laugh.

28:31.040 --> 28:34.320
Do you really need a tank full of jellyfish in your den?

28:34.320 --> 28:37.040
They smell like living creatures decaying.

28:37.040 --> 28:38.200
Only if they are decaying.

28:38.200 --> 28:39.960
Yeah, which they will be.

28:58.520 --> 28:59.520
How about another question?

28:59.520 --> 29:00.800
We're gonna help somebody else.

29:00.800 --> 29:01.800
Okay.

29:01.800 --> 29:02.800
We're doing better.

29:02.800 --> 29:03.800
Do that.

29:03.800 --> 29:10.080
I've been a huge Tom Hanks fan for years and currently have a steady girlfriend.

29:10.080 --> 29:14.760
Recently we've been watching movies and I recommended the 2000 Tom Hanks classic Castaway.

29:14.760 --> 29:16.920
But when I brought up the film, she refused.

29:16.920 --> 29:22.080
She said she thought Tom Hanks was overrated and had no desire to watch the film, claiming

29:22.080 --> 29:24.360
it's too long and probably sad.

29:24.360 --> 29:26.720
Yes and yes.

29:26.720 --> 29:29.220
How do I convince her to watch this Thomas classic?

29:29.220 --> 29:32.680
Which I'm sure she would thank me later for getting her to watch.

29:32.680 --> 29:36.880
I'm stranded in Stratton, PA.

29:36.880 --> 29:44.280
There's different categories of films of this type, I feel like, where there's films that

29:44.280 --> 29:47.000
are culturally important.

29:47.000 --> 29:52.080
And then there are films that are like, if you want to know what the whole hand on a

29:52.080 --> 29:56.440
volleyball thing is, you got to watch Castaway.

29:56.440 --> 30:01.240
You have to do your due diligence and spend two hours watching Tom Hanks cut his teeth

30:01.240 --> 30:04.640
out with roller, with ice skates.

30:04.640 --> 30:06.120
Oh, right.

30:06.120 --> 30:07.120
Yeah.

30:07.120 --> 30:08.840
And that's the price that you pay.

30:08.840 --> 30:12.880
Now I have a lot of films like this.

30:12.880 --> 30:16.640
Whenever people quote Casablanca, I nod my head along.

30:16.640 --> 30:17.800
Oh yes, yes, yes.

30:17.800 --> 30:19.880
A classic gray film.

30:19.880 --> 30:20.880
I do not know.

30:20.880 --> 30:22.820
I have not seen this film.

30:22.820 --> 30:28.500
And so there are parts that it could patch up some of my lack of cultural knowledge there,

30:28.500 --> 30:31.360
but I've decided that my time is better spent elsewhere.

30:31.360 --> 30:33.440
And that's what your girlfriend has done.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.960
And you know, that's what the internet's for.

30:35.960 --> 30:38.200
You Google what's up with the volleyball hand.

30:38.200 --> 30:40.720
Now I know I don't have to watch the film.

30:40.720 --> 30:42.480
You know, you make a good point, Gervin.

30:42.480 --> 30:47.320
We've entered a new period in time, this 2021, Big Dog Ren.

30:47.320 --> 30:51.160
And perhaps now's the time when someone's like, you haven't seen Casablanca.

30:51.160 --> 30:52.160
You have to watch it.

30:52.160 --> 30:54.200
And you just go, no, I don't.

30:54.200 --> 31:01.600
Do you know how many other things there are within my reach at any given time that I could

31:01.600 --> 31:03.720
choose to do?

31:03.720 --> 31:08.520
Yeah, it's liberating in a way.

31:08.520 --> 31:12.440
I will never watch a Criterion Collection film.

31:12.440 --> 31:18.580
And that's a huge weight off, being able to say that out loud in such a public place.

31:18.580 --> 31:19.980
But there it is.

31:19.980 --> 31:24.200
It's out there now.

31:24.200 --> 31:27.240
It's wild to me that that movie exists, isn't it?

31:27.240 --> 31:31.320
That seems like Hollywood was like, people seem to really like Tom Hanks.

31:31.320 --> 31:35.120
We should just do, just maybe just have him.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.120
A one-hander.

31:36.120 --> 31:39.400
Oh yeah, like a movie where he's having a good time and living his best life.

31:39.400 --> 31:40.400
Bad time.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.720
We destroy Tom Hanks for all of America to enjoy.

31:42.720 --> 31:44.520
I want to hurt Tom Hanks.

31:44.520 --> 31:47.360
And I'm a movie executive, and this is my pitch.

31:47.360 --> 31:49.200
I want to hurt Tom Hanks and see what happens.

31:49.200 --> 31:51.920
I'm going to hurt Tom Hanks for two hours and 24 minutes.

31:51.920 --> 31:53.840
Did you guys see the money pit?

31:53.840 --> 31:58.760
Every time that Tom Hanks falls in a hole or gets electrocuted or, you know, wastes

31:58.760 --> 32:02.160
money on this bad house, that was good for me.

32:02.160 --> 32:06.320
And I would like a film that is just about that, about Tom Hanks being hurt over and

32:06.320 --> 32:07.640
over again.

32:07.640 --> 32:11.040
There was a period of time that I think, here's my theory.

32:11.040 --> 32:17.120
There's a period of time where everyone really enjoyed watching Tom Hanks get hurt.

32:17.120 --> 32:19.400
Like the burbs and money pit.

32:19.400 --> 32:24.120
And then I think the natural culmination of that period was cast away.

32:24.120 --> 32:27.880
And I think after that everyone went, I don't like this anymore.

32:27.880 --> 32:30.840
I feel bad now that we've done this to Tom Hanks.

32:30.840 --> 32:34.120
Can he enter the period of time where the worst thing that happens to him is he's trapped

32:34.120 --> 32:35.600
in an airport terminal?

32:35.600 --> 32:37.920
Thank you, please.

32:37.920 --> 32:41.840
The worst thing that happens to him is he has to go back to community college, I think.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.040
I never saw that one.

32:43.040 --> 32:47.640
How long has it been since you guys watched Cast Away, the film Cast Away?

32:47.640 --> 32:48.800
Well, when did it come out?

32:48.800 --> 32:49.800
2000?

32:49.800 --> 32:50.800
So I would say about 21 years.

32:50.800 --> 32:51.800
Yeah.

32:51.800 --> 32:54.480
Yeah, I would estimate it's around there.

32:54.480 --> 32:57.480
Quick spoilies, just because I feel like we're kind of missing it.

32:57.480 --> 32:58.920
Just for just a minute.

32:58.920 --> 33:02.320
On Cast Away, he does get off the island.

33:02.320 --> 33:07.800
Do you guys remember that when he got off the island, his girlfriend married and had

33:07.800 --> 33:10.480
a kid and they had a funeral for him before?

33:10.480 --> 33:13.480
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Justin.

33:13.480 --> 33:15.680
What a picture that is.

33:15.680 --> 33:16.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:16.680 --> 33:17.680
What a picture.

33:17.680 --> 33:24.540
Do you think Bobby Zemeckis is like, my dream is to hang out on an island with Tom Hanks

33:24.540 --> 33:29.480
and just me and my friend Tom, and we're just getting buckwild on it and loving it.

33:29.480 --> 33:31.160
And that's what my dream is.

33:31.160 --> 33:32.160
Can everyone do that?

33:32.160 --> 33:36.920
Can we also remember that the big positive ending though is, don't worry, he still has

33:36.920 --> 33:38.840
that one package to deliver.

33:38.840 --> 33:42.680
So everything's not all bad for old Tommy Hanks.

33:42.680 --> 33:48.320
Can everyone real quick do their best impression of Tom Hanks' character in the Polar Express?

33:48.320 --> 33:50.200
I haven't seen it.

33:50.200 --> 33:51.200
Just saying like, where's your ticket?

33:51.200 --> 33:54.360
Now he has to say, I haven't seen it, but I'm going to do my best, okay?

33:54.360 --> 33:55.360
But where's your ticket?

33:55.360 --> 33:56.360
I'm Thomas Hanks.

33:56.360 --> 33:57.360
It's not all bad.

33:57.360 --> 33:58.360
It's more like, my ticket, please.

33:58.360 --> 33:59.360
My ticket.

33:59.360 --> 34:00.360
I need to see your ticket.

34:00.360 --> 34:01.360
See, yeah, see?

34:01.360 --> 34:02.360
All right, I'll try.

34:02.360 --> 34:08.160
I need to see, I need to see your ticket.

34:08.160 --> 34:10.040
Tom Hanks is a hard impression to do, huh?

34:10.040 --> 34:12.360
Yeah, he just sounds like everybody.

34:12.360 --> 34:13.840
Tom Hanks is the default.

34:13.840 --> 34:17.560
All other impressions are in relation to how Tom Hanks sounds.

34:17.560 --> 34:18.560
Do Woody.

34:18.560 --> 34:19.560
Okay.

34:19.560 --> 34:20.560
There's a snake in my boot.

34:20.560 --> 34:23.320
No, not that line.

34:23.320 --> 34:25.520
Do another line from Toy Story that Woody says.

34:25.520 --> 34:27.560
You are a toy!

34:27.560 --> 34:28.560
Whoa.

34:28.560 --> 34:29.560
Hey, Trav?

34:29.560 --> 34:30.560
That was actually Trav.

34:30.560 --> 34:31.560
That was really fucking good.

34:31.560 --> 34:32.560
He saw the podcast.

34:32.560 --> 34:35.880
Hey, Rachel, can we get it again?

34:35.880 --> 34:38.840
You are a toy!

34:38.840 --> 34:40.320
It was really good, Travis.

34:40.320 --> 34:41.320
It's good.

34:41.320 --> 34:42.320
It's actually pretty good, Trav.

34:42.320 --> 34:43.320
Thank you.

34:43.320 --> 34:44.320
Thank you very much.

34:44.320 --> 34:45.320
You've been hiding your line under a bush.

34:45.320 --> 34:46.720
No, I'm never going to try it again.

34:46.720 --> 34:48.080
Yeah, you can't.

34:48.080 --> 34:49.600
That was right off the hip.

34:49.600 --> 34:51.360
Can't hit that target again.

34:51.360 --> 34:52.640
Nobody ever asks Travis to do it again.

34:52.640 --> 34:53.640
He'll buckle.

34:53.640 --> 34:58.400
He'll do a really shit job the next time because we got that magic moment on tape.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.400
I'm so happy.

34:59.400 --> 35:01.480
In that moment, I was Tom Hanks, you guys.

35:01.480 --> 35:05.080
I saw his face overlap my face for a moment.

35:05.080 --> 35:06.080
Can I do a Yahoo?

35:06.080 --> 35:07.080
Yeah, please.

35:07.080 --> 35:09.800
I just want to send in by Graham Roebuck.

35:09.800 --> 35:10.800
Thanks, Graham.

35:10.800 --> 35:20.040
He's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user who I'm going to call Dan and asks, is there a special

35:20.040 --> 35:21.840
taste bud for chicken wings?

35:21.840 --> 35:25.600
I like to position the foods in my mouth to taste them according to the taste bud that

35:25.600 --> 35:26.840
tastes best for that food.

35:26.840 --> 35:30.460
Is there one for hot wings?

35:30.460 --> 35:37.360
I've recently learned that the taste bud map of your tongue is apocryphal, and this was

35:37.360 --> 35:38.360
heartbreaking to me.

35:38.360 --> 35:39.360
Really?

35:39.360 --> 35:40.360
I thought it was a thing.

35:40.360 --> 35:44.360
No, they're all mixed in with each other, except for the chicken wing taste bud, which

35:44.360 --> 35:46.480
is that dangly thing in the back of your throat.

35:46.480 --> 35:50.760
Oh, that's the chicken wing taste bud is the dangly thing that dangles down?

35:50.760 --> 35:53.840
So if you want to get the most out of your chicken wings, you got to shove it back there

35:53.840 --> 35:55.240
and rub it against that dangly thing.

35:55.240 --> 36:01.200
I always thought that was a sort of, I always called it the throdom because it was like

36:01.200 --> 36:02.200
a-

36:02.200 --> 36:03.200
The throdom is unpleasant.

36:03.200 --> 36:08.200
No, but you know in WAP when she says, I want to gag on a joke, I want it to touch that

36:08.200 --> 36:09.800
dangly thing in the back of my throat.

36:09.800 --> 36:10.800
Yeah.

36:10.800 --> 36:11.800
That's what it is.

36:11.800 --> 36:12.800
Yeah.

36:12.800 --> 36:13.800
That's what it means.

36:13.800 --> 36:15.480
Because she couldn't say my chicken wing taste bud.

36:15.480 --> 36:16.480
My one big one.

36:16.480 --> 36:17.480
Yeah.

36:17.480 --> 36:18.480
No.

36:18.480 --> 36:23.120
But that's why if you just hold the chicken wing on the tip of your tongue, nothing.

36:23.120 --> 36:25.400
You can't even, it's like there's nothing there.

36:25.400 --> 36:26.400
Yeah.

36:26.400 --> 36:27.400
That's interesting, Trump.

36:27.400 --> 36:32.860
As it slides whole down your gullet, you get all the flavor profile there.

36:32.860 --> 36:34.920
Maybe cry a little bit out of joy.

36:34.920 --> 36:39.440
Do you guys, I don't want to do it all, but do you guys know what the, do you guys know

36:39.440 --> 36:43.000
what the radio edit of WAP is?

36:43.000 --> 36:44.280
No.

36:44.280 --> 36:48.720
The radio edit of WAP, and I just want to take a quick poll.

36:48.720 --> 36:52.080
The radio edit of WAP is not wet ass pussy.

36:52.080 --> 36:54.780
It is in fact wet.

36:54.780 --> 36:55.780
It's wet and gushy.

36:55.780 --> 36:56.780
Oh yeah.

36:56.780 --> 36:57.780
Yeah.

36:57.780 --> 36:58.780
No, it's worse.

36:58.780 --> 36:59.780
Hey, it's worse, right?

36:59.780 --> 37:01.080
Like the radio edit is worse on that one.

37:01.080 --> 37:02.080
Yeah.

37:02.080 --> 37:09.000
It falls into a category that another one there is, there is a song by the Ying Yang

37:09.000 --> 37:15.200
Twins, and the real line is, we all like to see ass and titties.

37:15.200 --> 37:21.000
And then the radio edit is, we all like to see tiggle biddies, which I would argue is

37:21.000 --> 37:22.240
far more offensive.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.240
Yeah.

37:23.240 --> 37:24.240
Yeah, hugely challenging.

37:24.240 --> 37:26.280
A hugely challenging thing.

37:26.280 --> 37:27.280
Yeah.

37:27.280 --> 37:30.000
Till the sweat drops down the walls.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.080
Okay, we got wet and gushy.

37:33.080 --> 37:36.920
Although wet and gushy is good because then it lets her rhyme the next line where she's

37:36.920 --> 37:38.440
like, have you seen my tushy?

37:38.440 --> 37:43.480
Which is in the original song, and it's sort of a slant rhyme with the-

37:43.480 --> 37:45.360
Release the tapes about gushy.

37:45.360 --> 37:46.360
Yeah.

37:46.360 --> 37:47.360
Yeah.

37:47.360 --> 37:49.560
There's not a special taste bud for chicken wings.

37:49.560 --> 37:50.640
I wish that there was though.

37:50.640 --> 37:53.200
I wish we could hack our tongues.

37:53.200 --> 37:58.440
The right chicken wing engages all the buds, you know?

37:58.440 --> 38:05.460
The right chicken wing has invites over his friend Spicy, but he makes him stand outside

38:05.460 --> 38:10.460
and then he brings Sweet in, but then sends him out.

38:10.460 --> 38:19.040
And then Sour is on Zoom nearby, and Bitter is occasionally welcomed.

38:19.040 --> 38:20.220
It's Bitter's house.

38:20.220 --> 38:22.080
But not all at once, Justin.

38:22.080 --> 38:25.080
You're making it sound like it's stages, like a Neapolitan chicken wing.

38:25.080 --> 38:27.420
That's how you feel really savoring it.

38:27.420 --> 38:30.240
You're getting the heat, and then you're getting a bit of Sour.

38:30.240 --> 38:31.240
Oh my.

38:31.240 --> 38:33.880
Do you know how, Trav, when Justin eats chicken wings?

38:33.880 --> 38:40.260
He first dabs it on the tip of his tongue, which he has stuck way, way out of his mouth.

38:40.260 --> 38:45.000
And then he just kind of rubs it in a clockwise circle around his tongue and lips.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.560
He also will swirl the chicken wing around and then sniff it deeply.

38:48.560 --> 38:49.560
Yeah.

38:49.560 --> 38:50.560
He says that-

38:50.560 --> 38:51.560
Which I've always found troubling.

38:51.560 --> 38:52.560
Yeah.

38:52.560 --> 38:56.480
He says it helps him hit the flavor spot, and I don't, I don't.

38:56.480 --> 39:00.000
And he'll kind of like half moan, like, look at the legs.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
Yeah.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
You have to see its fingers.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.600
He doesn't actually chew and eat it, which is weird.

39:04.600 --> 39:06.120
He sets it right back down.

39:06.120 --> 39:07.120
Yeah.

39:07.120 --> 39:08.360
Spits it right there in the bucket.

39:08.360 --> 39:09.360
Yeah.

39:09.360 --> 39:12.600
All naked wings that you ever eat in your entire life have been pre-lit by me.

39:12.600 --> 39:13.600
That's true.

39:13.600 --> 39:14.780
That's weird, but it's true.

39:14.780 --> 39:18.000
And if they're a little bit crispy and naked, they've just been sitting out a long time.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
Yep.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
They've dried.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
Just dried in the sun.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
Yeah.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.640
I've been eating a lot of chick wings lately.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.000
Oh, tell me more.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
No.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
Okay.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
Yeah.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
You know what?

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
Here, I have this for you.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.640
I have this for you.

39:32.640 --> 39:36.720
I have this for you.

39:36.720 --> 39:37.720
I want to munch.

39:37.720 --> 39:38.720
Squad.

39:38.720 --> 39:39.720
Squad.

39:39.720 --> 39:42.720
I want to munch.

39:42.720 --> 39:43.720
Squad.

39:43.720 --> 39:44.720
Squad.

39:44.720 --> 39:51.680
What I was trying to capture there was like the soul of winter that didn't have a holiday

39:51.680 --> 39:52.680
feel.

39:52.680 --> 39:55.800
Oh, see, I was thinking it was feeling very, very Georgian.

39:55.800 --> 39:56.800
Okay.

39:56.800 --> 39:57.800
Very, uh.

39:57.800 --> 39:58.800
Sure.

39:58.800 --> 39:59.800
Yeah.

39:59.800 --> 40:00.800
Very Georgian.

40:00.800 --> 40:01.800
This is-

40:01.800 --> 40:05.480
Point Petersburg, Chekhov, Three Sixers, Uncle Vanya.

40:05.480 --> 40:11.720
We've never had you sort of just lay a munch squad at our feet, which is what it feels

40:11.720 --> 40:12.720
like you've done.

40:12.720 --> 40:13.720
I brought this to you.

40:13.720 --> 40:14.720
I usually interrupt, right?

40:14.720 --> 40:15.720
Yeah.

40:15.720 --> 40:20.440
But I feel like as you get older, you don't always want to be saddled with the bad boys

40:20.440 --> 40:21.440
podcasting.

40:21.440 --> 40:22.440
Yeah, sure.

40:22.440 --> 40:23.440
And I mean-

40:23.440 --> 40:24.440
You know.

40:24.440 --> 40:27.440
Especially as this segment moves into its denouement.

40:27.440 --> 40:28.440
Right.

40:28.440 --> 40:29.440
It's final.

40:29.440 --> 40:30.440
Okay.

40:30.440 --> 40:31.440
Right.

40:31.440 --> 40:32.440
That's out.

40:32.440 --> 40:33.440
So the other thing is like this one is, it's like, okay.

40:33.440 --> 40:34.440
Yeah.

40:34.440 --> 40:35.440
You know what I mean?

40:35.440 --> 40:36.840
And I don't want you guys to be like-

40:36.840 --> 40:38.480
It's good of you to know that about yourself, Justin.

40:38.480 --> 40:39.480
Why did you interrupt it?

40:39.480 --> 40:40.480
You know?

40:40.480 --> 40:41.480
Sure.

40:41.480 --> 40:42.480
Sure.

40:42.480 --> 40:43.480
Like why did you interrupt us for one that's okay?

40:43.480 --> 40:44.480
Panera bread.

40:44.480 --> 40:45.480
Do you, you guys heard this?

40:45.480 --> 40:46.480
Yes.

40:46.480 --> 40:49.880
I believe that it translates to bread bread, if I'm not mistaken.

40:49.880 --> 40:55.980
Panera bread did a, um, God, it's really weird.

40:55.980 --> 40:56.980
You know how they have bread bowls?

40:56.980 --> 40:57.980
Yeah.

40:57.980 --> 40:58.980
Yeah, sure.

40:58.980 --> 40:59.980
Okay.

40:59.980 --> 41:03.880
So they've made an ice and toasty bread bowl glove.

41:03.880 --> 41:04.880
Wait.

41:04.880 --> 41:05.880
Okay.

41:05.880 --> 41:06.880
Mm-hmm.

41:06.880 --> 41:13.600
So what the thing is with this is that it is a hand warmer.

41:13.600 --> 41:16.160
That's also a cup holder.

41:16.160 --> 41:19.440
So you can drink iced coffee, even when it's cold.

41:19.440 --> 41:21.560
And also it looks like a bread bowl.

41:21.560 --> 41:22.560
Now, okay.

41:22.560 --> 41:27.760
Until you got to that last part, it's just a glove, but then, huh.

41:27.760 --> 41:28.760
That's it.

41:28.760 --> 41:29.760
It's not made out of bread.

41:29.760 --> 41:30.760
Is it?

41:30.760 --> 41:31.760
Uh, no.

41:31.760 --> 41:32.760
That's the other thing about it.

41:32.760 --> 41:34.120
Fucking cowards.

41:34.120 --> 41:37.020
It's not made out of bread, right?

41:37.020 --> 41:38.840
So like, why did you?

41:38.840 --> 41:39.840
Why did you do it?

41:39.840 --> 41:40.840
Panera bread.

41:40.840 --> 41:42.840
You could have had, oh my God.

41:42.840 --> 41:46.760
Think of how much money they could have saved on soup.

41:46.760 --> 41:54.200
If they had started selling warmed, like right there, fresh from the oven bread gloves that

41:54.200 --> 41:58.800
you would go into a Panera bread, jam a couple of these on your fists and they'd be like,

41:58.800 --> 41:59.800
okay, that'll be 14.99.

41:59.800 --> 42:02.280
And you're like, I can't pay that.

42:02.280 --> 42:03.280
Look at my hands.

42:03.280 --> 42:05.680
How am I, how on earth am I supposed to pay that?

42:05.680 --> 42:07.600
That could have been so nice and fun.

42:07.600 --> 42:10.720
I sent you an image in Slack so you can look at it.

42:10.720 --> 42:12.320
It looks so wild.

42:12.320 --> 42:19.960
It looks like your hand is like a Lego person's hand made out of bread.

42:19.960 --> 42:27.080
What it looks like to me is like, there's some kind of bad guy in Doctor Who where it's

42:27.080 --> 42:30.320
like actual living dough that's trying to look like people.

42:30.320 --> 42:31.320
Okay.

42:31.320 --> 42:32.320
Yeah.

42:32.320 --> 42:33.320
I love that.

42:33.320 --> 42:36.120
And that's like how you can identify like, look at their hands, Doctor.

42:36.120 --> 42:42.480
There's nothing about it where, you know how sometimes you put your iced coffee into your

42:42.480 --> 42:43.480
bread bowl?

42:43.480 --> 42:46.960
It's like, you just combine things you had around.

42:46.960 --> 42:47.960
You know what I mean?

42:47.960 --> 42:50.120
Your iconography is getting fucking sloppy.

42:50.120 --> 42:51.120
Yeah.

42:51.120 --> 42:55.080
Like if somebody saw that, even if they thought, is that a real bread bowl?

42:55.080 --> 42:58.320
Their next thought would be, and are you using it to hold an iced coffee?

42:58.320 --> 42:59.320
What?

42:59.320 --> 43:00.320
Are you okay?

43:00.320 --> 43:03.960
I feel like those realizations would come the other way, Trav, where it would be like,

43:03.960 --> 43:10.080
why on God's green earth and Christ's earth do you have an iced coffee tucked into a bread

43:10.080 --> 43:11.080
bowl?

43:11.080 --> 43:13.000
And also, is that your hand in there?

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
Yep.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
Mm-hmm.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
Mm-hmm.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.440
They did a, oh God, it makes me so angry.

43:17.440 --> 43:18.440
So they did this.

43:18.440 --> 43:19.440
Right?

43:19.440 --> 43:20.440
Yeah.

43:20.440 --> 43:21.440
They made 450 of them.

43:21.440 --> 43:22.440
That's it.

43:22.440 --> 43:23.440
Fucking thanks.

43:23.440 --> 43:26.680
Like just have some fucking, some strength of your convictions.

43:26.680 --> 43:27.680
Right.

43:27.680 --> 43:32.840
You know, like if you believe people want it, you nasty pervert, then do it.

43:32.840 --> 43:33.840
Yeah.

43:33.840 --> 43:34.840
Right?

43:34.840 --> 43:35.840
Then just do it.

43:35.840 --> 43:36.960
You know what?

43:36.960 --> 43:42.200
Nothing can stop me from going into Panera Bread and ordering a empty, a bread bowl straight

43:42.200 --> 43:47.000
up and cramming my little, and cramming my little paw in there, is there?

43:47.000 --> 43:48.360
There ain't no log in it.

43:48.360 --> 43:49.360
There's nobody who's going to say anything to me.

43:49.360 --> 43:50.960
No, they wouldn't take it back from you.

43:50.960 --> 43:52.380
No, I paid for it.

43:52.380 --> 43:53.380
You know?

43:53.380 --> 43:54.380
And you'll pay for it.

43:54.380 --> 43:57.560
In the release where they were talking about it, they said, they cited a statistic that

43:57.560 --> 44:05.080
78% of Americans told them, Panera, that they continue to drink iced coffee even in cold

44:05.080 --> 44:06.080
weather.

44:06.080 --> 44:07.080
Yeah.

44:07.080 --> 44:08.080
Okay.

44:08.080 --> 44:09.400
Then you're fixing a fucking solved problem.

44:09.400 --> 44:11.240
Yeah, we already got this.

44:11.240 --> 44:12.240
We've got it.

44:12.240 --> 44:14.520
We're just doing it and going for it.

44:14.520 --> 44:19.440
78% said they still drink iced coffee, and 100% said they want to stick their little

44:19.440 --> 44:21.800
paws into one of our bread bowls.

44:21.800 --> 44:27.120
I think anybody, when given that opportunity, would leap at it.

44:27.120 --> 44:30.040
Would jump to, hey, I got a hot bread here, you want to jam your hand in there?

44:30.040 --> 44:31.040
Are you going to eat that bread?

44:31.040 --> 44:32.360
It seems like a waste of food.

44:32.360 --> 44:33.360
No, I'm not.

44:33.360 --> 44:36.000
This isn't, if you don't do it, I'm going to let somebody else do it.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.240
Oh, okay.

44:37.240 --> 44:38.680
Everybody would jam their hand in there.

44:38.680 --> 44:40.440
Everybody, everybody, everybody.

44:40.440 --> 44:44.760
Now if the glove was fresh bread bowl sent in, forget about it.

44:44.760 --> 44:45.760
We're done.

44:45.760 --> 44:47.280
I'm taking that all day every day.

44:47.280 --> 44:48.280
Yeah.

44:48.280 --> 44:52.320
I wanted to thank Liam for this one, actually, so thank you, Liam.

44:52.320 --> 44:57.360
Real quick, I did go ahead and go on over to icedandtoasty.com, which is weird that

44:57.360 --> 45:03.880
we didn't own that, but I did go to icedandtoasty.com, and there's just a big picture of the bowl,

45:03.880 --> 45:06.920
and then it says, sorry, we're all out.

45:06.920 --> 45:07.920
Oh, man.

45:07.920 --> 45:12.480
But then under it, there's a link that says, what does this mean?

45:12.480 --> 45:13.480
Oh.

45:13.480 --> 45:28.240
So I go to icedandtoasty.com, and it says, sorry, in huge letters, we're all out.

45:28.240 --> 45:29.240
What's that even mean?

45:29.240 --> 45:30.240
What does this mean?

45:30.240 --> 45:35.240
What do you even mean, sorry, you're all out?

45:35.240 --> 45:40.680
If you click, what does this mean, it then gives a really wordy explanation that breaks

45:40.680 --> 45:42.640
down to, we don't have any more.

45:42.640 --> 45:44.000
We don't have any more of them.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
I clicked it.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
Here's what it says.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
This is from Zach.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.520
Well, it's probably Zach, isn't it?

45:49.520 --> 45:53.000
Well, Zach, and then he's doing the rock horn emoji.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
Yeah.

45:54.000 --> 46:00.400
You may receive this message if all of the products in your area have been claimed or

46:00.400 --> 46:05.580
you're participating after the promotional period has ended.

46:05.580 --> 46:09.120
So in other words, they're all out.

46:09.120 --> 46:10.120
They don't have any.

46:10.120 --> 46:15.320
Well, and then down at the bottom, it then says, 11 out of 23 found this helpful, which

46:15.320 --> 46:18.080
means that there were 12 people who were like, I'm still confused.

46:18.080 --> 46:19.080
I don't get it.

46:19.080 --> 46:20.080
Get it.

46:20.080 --> 46:22.680
How does this help me get a bread bowl glove?

46:22.680 --> 46:24.440
Explain again, Zach, but slower.

46:24.440 --> 46:25.680
Anyway, you can't get it.

46:25.680 --> 46:27.200
I don't know why I wasted your time.

46:27.200 --> 46:28.400
It's a dumb idea.

46:28.400 --> 46:32.560
When Liam sent it, Liam said it's an edible Panera bread cup holder.

46:32.560 --> 46:33.560
That's not right.

46:33.560 --> 46:38.520
Well, it's also right in the sense that like, why the fuck else are they doing it?

46:38.520 --> 46:43.440
If they made an edible cup holder, that's like we baked in a slot for your hand because

46:43.440 --> 46:47.840
we're absolutely out of a solitary fuck to give that I'm into it.

46:47.840 --> 46:53.240
If you want to let me like hold an iced coffee and then finish it, then eat the thing out

46:53.240 --> 46:56.000
my hand because it doesn't have a purpose anymore.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.140
That's biodegradable.

46:57.140 --> 46:58.640
That's 2021.

46:58.640 --> 46:59.640
You know what I mean?

46:59.640 --> 47:00.640
That's new tech.

47:00.640 --> 47:04.120
I think we've talked about it on this show before, but edible doesn't mean digestible.

47:04.120 --> 47:05.120
Liam's not wrong.

47:05.120 --> 47:06.120
Yeah.

47:06.120 --> 47:07.600
You could eat that glove if you tried hard enough.

47:07.600 --> 47:12.360
I'm just saying if they wanted to rebrand as Panera's boutique and they only sold bread

47:12.360 --> 47:15.960
clothes, I think that would be a killer Swaperoni.

47:15.960 --> 47:17.760
Oh yeah.

47:17.760 --> 47:18.760
What else do you guys want to do?

47:18.760 --> 47:20.880
I mean, we do the questions.

47:20.880 --> 47:23.320
We only did two, I guess.

47:23.320 --> 47:24.320
Two?

47:24.320 --> 47:25.320
Yeah.

47:25.320 --> 47:26.320
Two.

47:26.320 --> 47:27.320
Okay.

47:27.320 --> 47:30.600
That's not bad, but I will do another one if you want or Yahoo.

47:30.600 --> 47:35.000
I think the second question is powerful and we should read that.

47:35.000 --> 47:40.200
My employer offers a small stipend for purchase of clothing with the company's logo.

47:40.200 --> 47:44.600
Most of it is pretty bland, polo shirts, light jackets, caps, et cetera.

47:44.600 --> 47:50.240
This year though, they're offering jeans with the company logo embroidered across the ass.

47:50.240 --> 47:54.600
What occasions are appropriate for business casual juicy jeans?

47:54.600 --> 47:59.760
How should I complete the outfit to really impress our clients?

47:59.760 --> 48:02.320
Dress to impress in DC.

48:02.320 --> 48:12.440
An unbuttoned, white, thin fabric shirt and there's a fan close by.

48:12.440 --> 48:19.720
Also, you could do a popped collar jean jacket of the same denim material and make sure you

48:19.720 --> 48:22.840
always have your back turned to them and you're looking over a shoulder.

48:22.840 --> 48:27.720
And make sure you tuck that jacket into the pants just to really complete the look.

48:27.720 --> 48:28.800
That's good, Trav.

48:28.800 --> 48:33.400
If you can find denim shoes, I don't know if that's anything, but anything that draws

48:33.400 --> 48:35.560
attention back to the ass is what you want.

48:35.560 --> 48:40.120
Let me call John Mellencamp and ask to borrow one of his many pairs of denim shoes.

48:40.120 --> 48:41.120
Hold on.

48:41.120 --> 48:42.120
Okay.

48:42.120 --> 48:43.120
I'll get them on the horn.

48:43.120 --> 48:44.120
Okay.

48:44.120 --> 48:46.960
This is not a skit I'm going to do because I don't really know anything about John Mellencamp,

48:46.960 --> 48:47.960
but-

48:47.960 --> 48:55.800
I feel like a great use of this would be if you're doing a presentation and you're like

48:55.800 --> 49:01.400
to a new client and then it's like you use it as the punchline of the presentation because

49:01.400 --> 49:04.480
it makes it look like you went the extra mile.

49:04.480 --> 49:05.480
You know what I mean?

49:05.480 --> 49:12.640
It's like, and one thing I can say about Fidelity Capital Management, we won't be bringing up

49:12.640 --> 49:13.640
the rear.

49:13.640 --> 49:14.640
That's really good.

49:14.640 --> 49:18.640
And you show up your ass and it's like, this company gets it.

49:18.640 --> 49:19.640
That's it.

49:19.640 --> 49:20.640
Yeah.

49:20.640 --> 49:23.360
And then they'll be like, why do your jeans look so dirty and smell so bad?

49:23.360 --> 49:29.720
And you're like, I do not take these off because I love the company.

49:29.720 --> 49:31.760
You heard the part where I talked about loving the company, right?

49:31.760 --> 49:34.300
So like, why would I take off my Fidelity pants?

49:34.300 --> 49:38.520
You could do another pair of jeans over those jeans.

49:38.520 --> 49:40.960
And then when someone's like, I can't believe you wore jeans to work.

49:40.960 --> 49:42.400
You're like, yeah, sorry.

49:42.400 --> 49:43.400
I forgot.

49:43.400 --> 49:44.760
It's a little too casual.

49:44.760 --> 49:49.640
And then you tear those pants away and underneath you have your business, Juicy Jeans.

49:49.640 --> 49:52.120
And everyone's like, that's what I talk about, bro.

49:52.120 --> 49:57.240
And you all high five a bunch and then maybe play some volleyball out in the lawn, I assume.

49:57.240 --> 49:58.240
In your jeans.

49:58.240 --> 49:59.240
Just some jeans volleyball like you do.

49:59.240 --> 50:00.240
Just some jeans volleyball.

50:00.240 --> 50:01.240
Regular jeans volleyball.

50:01.240 --> 50:03.600
The chafing is part of the fun.

50:03.600 --> 50:04.600
Yeah.

50:04.600 --> 50:07.180
It's an endurance sport, jeans volleyball.

50:07.180 --> 50:08.680
Why do they make these?

50:08.680 --> 50:10.920
What do you mean?

50:10.920 --> 50:11.920
Why do they-

50:11.920 --> 50:14.200
It's really kind of weird, isn't it?

50:14.200 --> 50:17.080
It's kind of weird that they would think you would want to put the company's logo right

50:17.080 --> 50:18.080
on your ass.

50:18.080 --> 50:19.080
Yeah.

50:19.080 --> 50:21.760
No, it's not a good place for that.

50:21.760 --> 50:23.240
I guess it depends on what the company is.

50:23.240 --> 50:30.280
Is there a company where, other than Juicy, do you work at Juicy corporate headquarters?

50:30.280 --> 50:32.880
What about endoscopy cameras?

50:32.880 --> 50:35.760
Like if you were like, is that the right one?

50:35.760 --> 50:36.760
Colonoscopy.

50:36.760 --> 50:37.760
That's what I meant.

50:37.760 --> 50:47.120
Like if you were a company that produced enemas, colonoscopy, or just like a billboard company,

50:47.120 --> 50:50.520
and then it has it there and it's like, you looked, didn't you?

50:50.520 --> 50:54.520
And this is what you're trying to sell now is, hi, my name is Travis McElroy, and for

50:54.520 --> 50:58.600
$100 a month, you can buy ad space on my ass.

50:58.600 --> 50:59.600
That's it.

50:59.600 --> 51:00.600
Oh, it's for sale.

51:00.600 --> 51:03.200
Does jeans but advertising work?

51:03.200 --> 51:04.200
Just did.

51:04.200 --> 51:05.200
Because you looked.

51:05.200 --> 51:06.200
I made you look.

51:06.200 --> 51:07.200
You looked at my height.

51:07.200 --> 51:09.040
You looked at my hiner, didn't you?

51:09.040 --> 51:10.040
Yeah.

51:10.040 --> 51:13.200
Are you looking for a house with a great backyard?

51:13.200 --> 51:16.240
And then it has like the listing for, you know, some real estate agents in there, right?

51:16.240 --> 51:17.240
Yeah.

51:17.240 --> 51:18.880
But it's on my ass because I have a great backyard.

51:18.880 --> 51:19.880
Yep.

51:19.880 --> 51:23.480
Next Buc-ee's, exit 23A and 15 miles.

51:23.480 --> 51:24.480
But it says it-

51:24.480 --> 51:25.480
Follow me to-

51:25.480 --> 51:26.480
Right.

51:26.480 --> 51:29.620
Follow me to Buc-ee's, and it says it right there.

51:29.620 --> 51:33.320
It's got basically MapQuest directions to Buc-ee's on my dumper.

51:33.320 --> 51:34.320
Yeah.

51:34.320 --> 51:35.320
Yep, yep, yep.

51:35.320 --> 51:36.320
Yep, yep, yep.

51:36.320 --> 51:42.080
Now, this started as a joke, but now I'm starting to think I could maybe sell some ad space

51:42.080 --> 51:43.080
on my butt.

51:43.080 --> 51:44.080
I think anybody could.

51:44.080 --> 51:45.080
Okay, I want to give you guys a challenge.

51:45.080 --> 51:46.080
Okay, okay.

51:46.080 --> 51:47.080
Are you guys ready for this?

51:47.080 --> 51:48.080
Yeah.

51:48.080 --> 51:49.080
This is a thought experiment for thought leaders like ourselves.

51:49.080 --> 51:50.080
Okay.

51:50.080 --> 51:55.160
If we had to put up a piece of McElroy Family merchandise where it was jeans but the logo

51:55.160 --> 51:59.280
was on the ass, what would you guys do?

51:59.280 --> 52:00.280
We have to do it.

52:00.280 --> 52:02.280
What, would we advertise on the back?

52:02.280 --> 52:03.280
Or what would that-

52:03.280 --> 52:04.280
What would it be?

52:04.280 --> 52:05.280
Just, yeah, describe the product, I guess.

52:05.280 --> 52:09.320
I'd probably put an ad for pets.com on there, but I think it's because you mentioned the

52:09.320 --> 52:10.320
.com bubble earlier.

52:10.320 --> 52:11.320
Yeah, yeah.

52:11.320 --> 52:12.320
And now it's kind of all I can think about.

52:12.320 --> 52:13.480
And my brain went there, too.

52:13.480 --> 52:14.480
My brain was-

52:14.480 --> 52:20.720
So that would be a piece of McElroy Family merch that we would sell that would be the

52:20.720 --> 52:21.720
pets.com logo?

52:21.720 --> 52:22.720
Yes.

52:22.720 --> 52:23.720
Yeah, something like that.

52:23.720 --> 52:28.800
Okay, so you've already, hearing it back, parroted back at you to try to cease the cracks.

52:28.800 --> 52:29.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:29.800 --> 52:38.400
It's a truth campaign, but not their anti-vaping thing they're on now, but like old truth back

52:38.400 --> 52:45.480
in like 2001 where it's like, check out this person and the machine they use to talk.

52:45.480 --> 52:50.440
But we've put that on their butt of merch pants.

52:50.440 --> 52:55.000
I think I would advertise the pants on the pants so that when people look at the pants,

52:55.000 --> 52:57.880
they're like, well, now I want to get those pants, but I don't know where to get them.

52:57.880 --> 52:59.720
It's like, well, the information's right there.

52:59.720 --> 53:00.720
Yeah.

53:00.720 --> 53:03.960
You can get ad pants right there.

53:03.960 --> 53:04.960
I like that.

53:04.960 --> 53:14.520
Or it's like the pants are an ad for your ass branding company, ass branding limited,

53:14.520 --> 53:15.520
let's call it.

53:15.520 --> 53:21.100
And the logo is a pair of jeans that have the ass branding limited wordmark on them,

53:21.100 --> 53:27.080
which happens to be shaped like a pair of jeans, so it's just infinite into your butt.

53:27.080 --> 53:28.560
Jeans all the way down, baby.

53:28.560 --> 53:30.240
Jeans all the way down.

53:30.240 --> 53:35.240
You need a kit, but the good news is if you go too deep, Joseph Gordon-Levitt will kick

53:35.240 --> 53:39.720
your chair into the bathtub, kick you right back up, right out the jeans.

53:39.720 --> 53:44.120
Joseph Gordon-Levitt, that chair kicked into the tub, kicked me right out my jeans.

53:44.120 --> 53:46.640
Kicked me out my jeans, JGL.

53:46.640 --> 53:49.640
Thanks for saving me from my jeans.

53:49.640 --> 53:52.640
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, where's my top?

53:52.640 --> 53:57.600
I need my shirt that I wore with the jeans, JGL, damn.

53:57.600 --> 53:58.960
Are you wearing those jeans?

53:58.960 --> 54:00.840
Were you wearing those jeans when I went in?

54:00.840 --> 54:01.840
Are we still in it?

54:01.840 --> 54:02.840
Oh no.

54:02.840 --> 54:03.840
Oh no.

54:03.840 --> 54:04.840
Kick it.

54:04.840 --> 54:07.160
My wife is trapped in some jeans.

54:07.160 --> 54:09.320
Kick me again, JGL, damn.

54:09.320 --> 54:13.840
I'm in my wife's childhood jeans.

54:13.840 --> 54:19.480
My wife created jeans for us to live in together, but it was between our two jeans.

54:19.480 --> 54:20.480
Oh no.

54:20.480 --> 54:21.480
Let me spin my magic top.

54:21.480 --> 54:24.880
All right, damn it, I left it in my jeans one layer up.

54:24.880 --> 54:25.880
Fuck.

54:25.880 --> 54:30.640
Hey, Tom Hardy, bring my jeans now when you come.

54:30.640 --> 54:31.920
Or at least my magic top.

54:31.920 --> 54:34.920
It's in the pocket of my jeans in your jeans layer.

54:34.920 --> 54:38.040
Hey, I just want to tell you, guy, you're super old now.

54:38.040 --> 54:40.040
Your jeans still look great.

54:40.040 --> 54:41.360
Still wear the hell out of them jeans.

54:41.360 --> 54:43.360
I believe you mean Ken Watanabe.

54:43.360 --> 54:44.360
You said the name.

54:44.360 --> 54:45.360
Extremely old man.

54:45.360 --> 54:46.360
Yes, yes, yes, Ken Watanabe.

54:46.360 --> 54:47.360
Elliot Page.

54:47.360 --> 54:48.360
Way to spoil.

54:48.360 --> 54:49.360
Way to spoil.

54:49.360 --> 54:50.360
Yeah, way to spoil everything.

54:50.360 --> 54:55.080
Elliot Page, I need you to craft some jeans for me with your... No, the jeans were paying

54:55.080 --> 54:57.200
attention to themselves.

54:57.200 --> 54:59.000
The jeans are aware we're in them.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.600
I'm a jeans architect.

55:00.600 --> 55:01.600
You're a tailor?

55:01.600 --> 55:02.600
No.

55:02.600 --> 55:03.600
I've said that many times.

55:03.600 --> 55:08.720
Michael Caine, young and old Michael Caine, all this must be a dream.

55:08.720 --> 55:10.920
We're all three in jeans and kissing.

55:10.920 --> 55:16.480
Sydney made fun of me today for falling over in the snow, and I said, why do we fall, Master

55:16.480 --> 55:17.480
Bruce?

55:17.480 --> 55:18.480
It's to get back up again.

55:18.480 --> 55:23.160
And my voice started sounding like Bane, and I accidentally, and I did Michael Bane.

55:23.160 --> 55:24.160
Michael Bane.

55:24.160 --> 55:27.040
It sounds like a Michael Caine and a Bane impression mixed together.

55:27.040 --> 55:28.040
Mr. Wayne?

55:28.040 --> 55:29.040
Mr. Wayne.

55:29.040 --> 55:32.040
Come in the shorts to a store, Bob.

55:32.040 --> 55:33.040
Mr. Wayne.

55:33.040 --> 55:35.640
It sounds like he's drowning now.

55:35.640 --> 55:44.720
Henry loves Batman, and one time I had him say, where's Falcone, as deep-voiced Batman,

55:44.720 --> 55:49.640
and now he says it anytime he plays Batman, and I feel like I've ruined him.

55:49.640 --> 55:52.600
I feel like nothing will satisfy him now.

55:52.600 --> 55:53.600
Where is Falcone?

55:53.600 --> 55:57.720
Yeah, he asked, and he's like, who is Falcone and why does Batman want him?

55:57.720 --> 56:02.080
And I have to tell him it's because he didn't pay attention in virtual school.

56:02.080 --> 56:03.080
You think that's bad?

56:03.080 --> 56:05.400
My daughter said ba-ba-booey to me this week.

56:05.400 --> 56:06.400
Oh, that's so bad.

56:06.400 --> 56:07.400
That hurts.

56:07.400 --> 56:08.400
Thanks for listening.

56:08.400 --> 56:09.600
Thanks for listening to our podcast.

56:09.600 --> 56:13.760
We're three great dads, and we're happy to have you here.

56:13.760 --> 56:17.320
We hope you're hanging in there as much as can be expected.

56:17.320 --> 56:24.160
If you want to buy some merchandise, we don't have any jeans on offer currently, but if

56:24.160 --> 56:26.440
you go to McElroy Merch, you'll find some other stuff.

56:26.440 --> 56:32.680
There's a cute little boy car pin by Zachary Sterling, our candle lights special, you can

56:32.680 --> 56:34.180
now get that.

56:34.180 --> 56:39.200
We got a Taste of Luxury stemless wine glass and a t-shirt designed by Kevin Budnick.

56:39.200 --> 56:43.360
If you want to watch that, by the way, search Taste of Luxury on YouTube and watch it.

56:43.360 --> 56:44.360
I'd really appreciate it.

56:44.360 --> 56:45.360
It's real funny.

56:45.360 --> 56:46.360
I'm so proud of it.

56:46.360 --> 56:47.360
I'm so proud of watching things.

56:47.360 --> 56:52.240
We got an Adventure Zone Live virtual show this week, February 19th at 9pm Eastern Time.

56:52.240 --> 56:54.160
It's virtual and interactive.

56:54.160 --> 56:58.080
That means there will come moments when we'll need your help deciding what the players do.

56:58.080 --> 57:01.520
We're going to be playing Honey Heist with special guest Erica Ishii.

57:01.520 --> 57:02.520
Tickets are just $10.

57:02.520 --> 57:04.840
You can get them at live.themacroy.family.

57:04.840 --> 57:06.800
It's going to be a blast and a half, folks.

57:06.800 --> 57:08.920
Hey, pre-order Crystal Kingdom.

57:08.920 --> 57:09.920
The third?

57:09.920 --> 57:10.920
Fourth?

57:10.920 --> 57:11.920
Fourth.

57:11.920 --> 57:12.920
Jesus.

57:12.920 --> 57:13.920
We've written a lot of books.

57:13.920 --> 57:16.960
There's a lot of novel in the Adventure Zone balance series.

57:16.960 --> 57:17.960
It's real good.

57:17.960 --> 57:18.960
Go to theadventurezonecomic.com.

57:18.960 --> 57:22.040
Book comes out July 13th, 2021, but don't wait.

57:22.040 --> 57:24.040
Y'all want a final Yahoo?

57:24.040 --> 57:25.040
Yes, please.

57:25.040 --> 57:26.040
Absolutely.

57:26.040 --> 57:28.720
This final Yahoo was sent in by the wizard Ben Cant.

57:28.720 --> 57:29.720
Thank you, Ben.

57:29.720 --> 57:36.160
It is Yahoo Answers user T who asks, how comes bad guys in movies don't eat an apple with

57:36.160 --> 57:38.160
a pocket knife no more?

57:38.160 --> 57:39.160
Yes.

57:39.160 --> 57:40.160
Thank you.

57:40.160 --> 57:42.880
My name is Justin McElroy.

57:42.880 --> 57:43.880
I'm Travis McElroy.

57:43.880 --> 57:44.880
I'm Griffin McElroy.

57:44.880 --> 57:47.880
This has been my brother, my brother, me, Kiss Your Dad.

57:47.880 --> 57:48.880
School.

57:48.880 --> 57:49.880
Air on the lips.

57:49.880 --> 57:50.880
Okay.

57:50.880 --> 57:51.880
That was the show.

57:51.880 --> 57:52.880
Hope you had some fun.

57:52.880 --> 57:53.880
Talked for an hour and now our job is done.

57:53.880 --> 57:54.880
Go back into the world.

57:54.880 --> 57:55.880
Face the day ahead.

57:55.880 --> 58:19.720
Please don't tell our grandparents all the cuss words we said.

58:19.720 --> 58:20.720
Maximumfun.org.

58:20.720 --> 58:21.720
Comedy and culture.

58:21.720 --> 58:22.720
Artists owned.

58:22.720 --> 58:23.720
Audience supported.

58:23.720 --> 58:24.720
Hey, it's Jesse.

58:24.720 --> 58:26.040
Hi, Chris.

58:26.040 --> 58:27.720
It's Jesse calling from Maximum Fun.

58:27.720 --> 58:28.720
Hey, Jesse.

58:28.720 --> 58:30.720
I heard that you got into a car accident.

58:30.720 --> 58:36.960
Yeah, I was listening to stop podcasting yourself and I just laughed so hard that I slammed

58:36.960 --> 58:39.720
into a construction barrier.

58:39.720 --> 58:44.480
You remember what it was that was so funny?

58:44.480 --> 58:45.480
I will never forget.

58:45.480 --> 58:46.480
I'm sure.

58:46.480 --> 58:51.120
They started talking about Vegas and the, you know, if it happens here, it stays here

58:51.120 --> 58:52.120
and that's Logan.

58:52.120 --> 58:56.080
And then Graham was talking about, oh, you know, wasn't there some other slogan for another

58:56.080 --> 58:57.080
commercial?

58:57.080 --> 59:01.360
I was like a commercial for food and it said like, whatever's in there stays in there.

59:01.360 --> 59:08.760
I can't remember what it was, clams or something, just so ridiculous.

59:08.760 --> 59:10.360
And man, I got lightheaded.

59:10.360 --> 59:13.080
I was laughing so hard.

59:13.080 --> 59:20.280
Next thing I know, they are, they are just brilliantly funny.

59:20.280 --> 59:24.120
So I talked to Dave and Graham from stop podcasting yourself.

59:24.120 --> 59:26.120
We would like to pay your car repair bill.

59:26.120 --> 59:27.120
Is that okay?

59:27.120 --> 59:29.520
That, I mean, that would be super nice, Jesse.

59:29.520 --> 59:31.400
I really thank you.

59:31.400 --> 59:50.680
I appreciate that.
