00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.660 --> 00:49.660
It's better it's better

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
It's better it's better

01:00.300 --> 01:02.300
Better it's better

01:11.820 --> 01:15.700
Starting next month to my friends and I will be moving into a new house together

01:15.700 --> 01:21.100
Each of us will have our own bedroom, but there's an extra medium-sized room downstairs

01:21.100 --> 01:24.340
No one will be using the room has no egress window

01:24.460 --> 01:28.100
So we don't want to make it into a bedroom got some code issues there dig it

01:28.300 --> 01:30.920
But we're at a loss for what we should do with it

01:30.920 --> 01:36.060
I was hoping the brothers could come give us ideas about what we could do with this extra space any thoughts

01:36.060 --> 01:38.060
That's from many problem in Minneapolis

01:38.540 --> 01:40.540
P.s. For what it's worth. We're all guys

01:40.580 --> 01:42.580
hot guys

01:42.580 --> 01:45.220
Sincerely Chad Braden blaze a

01:46.420 --> 01:50.860
Blizz three and blaze three hot bros Blizz blaze and blunts

01:51.860 --> 01:58.580
Just kidding two losses the goofy one. Yeah, the goofy, but it's still super fucking kind of gorgeous. Great work blunts

02:00.260 --> 02:04.220
Blunts he's Austrian guys. I didn't know I

02:04.220 --> 02:11.980
I didn't know egress windows were a thing because when the first apartment we lived in in the 13th story

02:12.380 --> 02:16.020
Which is great just for starters just in terms of fiery luck

02:16.860 --> 02:21.060
We made Eric sleep in that one room that didn't have any windows in it. I

02:22.060 --> 02:25.460
Think once you're on the 13th floor Griffin, you don't have to worry about egress windows

02:25.460 --> 02:28.860
Yeah, I don't think that's gonna do you much good at that point. So how about this?

02:28.860 --> 02:34.260
lock the door to said room after filling it with like like

02:34.420 --> 02:37.620
Child's bedroom furniture that you've covered in dust and cobwebs

02:41.740 --> 02:47.860
You're just leaving a little surprise for the next person that tries to remodel this place every time your friends come up

02:47.860 --> 02:52.020
We go. Oh, I want a tour of your house. Yeah. This is the kitchen. Here's the living room our bedrooms upstairs

02:52.020 --> 02:57.460
What's in that room? We don't go in we don't go in that go in there not since the boat accident

02:57.460 --> 03:04.260
Can you to make this the longest and best con Travis? You just took that idea to ten?

03:04.260 --> 03:06.720
I'm about to take it just a little bit farther to 11

03:06.720 --> 03:09.540
Can you wallpaper over the door to that room?

03:09.580 --> 03:15.500
Cuz then nobody's gonna then nobody's gonna find it for 40 goddamn years and it's gonna have a level of authenticity

03:15.900 --> 03:20.460
At that point that I think is just in the center of the room copy of Jumanji. Oh

03:22.180 --> 03:24.180
The movie

03:24.180 --> 03:27.820
That's great, that's real great that's too funny

03:29.140 --> 03:31.140
That can be where you smoke all your pot

03:31.940 --> 03:33.620
That's always important

03:33.620 --> 03:35.820
Drug room just drug group. This is our drug room

03:36.500 --> 03:38.500
The laziest panic room

03:39.300 --> 03:41.180
Just go in there

03:41.180 --> 03:44.820
Close the door you do. This is tricky because I've worked from home for a long time

03:45.900 --> 03:50.260
And in a couple of places including like the house that I I now own with my wife

03:50.260 --> 03:57.660
one of the bedrooms is where I sleep and the other one is where I work because it's my office and it's like I

03:57.660 --> 03:59.700
Get two rooms. That doesn't really seem fair

04:00.260 --> 04:02.540
It doesn't really seem like an equitable

04:04.100 --> 04:07.220
Situation you could trade off and say like Monday Wednesday Friday

04:07.900 --> 04:12.940
The room can be whatever guy a once but then Tuesday Thursday Saturday

04:13.420 --> 04:16.380
It's whatever guy be once and then Sunday

04:16.380 --> 04:22.940
You share it free-for-all party room if you guys had an extra room in the houses you live in now

04:22.940 --> 04:28.280
What would you do with it yoga studio? Did you say yogurt studio because then maybe

04:29.460 --> 04:31.540
Yeah, it's where I paint yogurt

04:33.300 --> 04:34.620
I

04:34.620 --> 04:35.980
think

04:35.980 --> 04:40.980
Gosh, I don't know. We just did like a big purge of all our our stuff

04:40.980 --> 04:44.620
We had one extra room and that that was for the kids

04:44.620 --> 04:49.500
So I guess I don't have any extra rooms anymore. Now. I don't know what I would do with it. Maybe like

04:50.140 --> 04:51.980
just a

04:51.980 --> 04:53.980
more storage

04:54.100 --> 04:59.720
Man, I'd really shot the cannon in doors with that one. Here's what I would do

04:59.720 --> 05:00.180
Okay

05:00.180 --> 05:04.660
I'd put a bunch of newspaper clippings and pictures of people around town on the wall

05:04.660 --> 05:07.300
All right, and then with thumbtacks and pieces of stress

05:07.300 --> 05:10.420
All of them absolutely with like with some people's faces

05:11.500 --> 05:18.480
Yeah, that's like what does it all mean where the money go? What what happened with the case, you know, just all over it

05:19.620 --> 05:25.560
That's just there for people to walk into and go what what is and like I I've almost got it

05:25.560 --> 05:28.780
I've almost got it. It's it's it's right there on the tip of my tongue

05:28.860 --> 05:36.040
I've almost solved it and then usher them out of the room. So basically Travis you want an all-purpose goof room

05:36.040 --> 05:42.760
Yeah, I want like a room of requirement that every time you open the door. It's a different punchline to a joke. Sure

05:43.400 --> 05:47.880
Okay, and a team of people that changes it out betwixt the goofs. Okay, and they live there

05:47.880 --> 05:55.200
Can we just please have a bedroom here, please? You call us in here. No, you can't this is our all-purpose goof room

05:55.840 --> 05:58.620
We will sleep on the inflatable mattress in the dining room

05:59.440 --> 06:02.600
Cuz that's I mean we gotta have our goofs

06:02.600 --> 06:04.600
Oh

06:04.600 --> 06:06.600
We're human

06:06.600 --> 06:08.080
not goof

06:08.080 --> 06:13.180
Human humans good. I have to goof humans got a goof always be goofing. That's us

06:13.920 --> 06:20.880
I work on a history ship. No ghosts. Sorry not to be fair. Doesn't it does a historic ship not a

06:23.960 --> 06:27.680
History ship we're going back to 1512

06:27.680 --> 06:31.720
What's up in 1512? Nothing. It sucks hop on the boat

06:32.800 --> 06:34.800
Here comes the time doc

06:35.880 --> 06:42.460
Shit we missed the time to pay your fees to disembark. We missed the time doc now. It's 1314

06:42.480 --> 06:44.480
It gets worse as you go back

06:45.560 --> 06:50.120
Now we're gonna charge you all a premium for the smallpox vaccine

06:50.560 --> 06:57.400
That's how they get you on history timeship how they extort you on the history ship. I work on a historic ship

06:57.400 --> 07:02.840
No ghosts. Sorry prove that and also that you can see and that have made them their presence. No

07:02.840 --> 07:05.600
Yeah, I mean, let's let's qualify a little bit. They're all

07:06.400 --> 07:09.580
I also live in one of the staterooms that used to be officers quarters

07:09.580 --> 07:13.940
The deal is that I live here for free as long as I agree to be the after-hours

07:14.440 --> 07:20.080
Security guard the problem is I have a hard time kicking people off who snuck on late at night

07:20.200 --> 07:22.580
I'm not a naturally intimidating person

07:22.580 --> 07:29.040
I'm a young early 20s woman usually very cheerful sort of plump and I like nearly everyone I meet

07:29.200 --> 07:32.640
What are some things I can do to scare trespassers?

07:32.640 --> 07:38.560
So they'll get lost without putting up a fight and that's from scarcely scary sailor your last sentence

07:38.560 --> 07:42.400
Your last sentence is answered by your first one. Yes

07:43.120 --> 07:49.800
You have a thousand times. Yes, you have to pretend a ghost you gotta ghost them. You have to ghost them

07:49.800 --> 07:56.160
Yes, all you have to do walk up in like, oh like a old-timey dress and say like have you seen my child?

07:59.520 --> 08:06.920
God Travis you just put a chill up my spine. Yeah, right a ghostly GMVM chillers. Who have you seen my husband?

08:08.520 --> 08:10.520
The lifeboats

08:11.880 --> 08:13.880
Tropic chillers, I'm

08:13.880 --> 08:21.880
I'm cold. I ate some bad shrimp at the buffet. Oh, no, I've had the norovirus for three days

08:21.880 --> 08:26.120
I don't have any fluid in my body or my bowels

08:27.000 --> 08:28.720
I

08:28.720 --> 08:30.720
booped everywhere

08:31.200 --> 08:36.880
The porter lost my trunk. That's not ectoplasm. It's my crushing diarrhea

08:37.920 --> 08:39.920
Again, oh no, I've gotta go bye

08:39.920 --> 08:41.920
I

08:42.840 --> 08:44.840
What if you

08:45.920 --> 08:52.240
What if you are too good is my worry and they stab you because they don't know how ghosts work and they bust you

08:52.240 --> 08:58.200
No, and they know they call the Ghostbusters. Here's my question. Okay, you're a very convincing ghost

08:58.200 --> 09:05.680
Yeah, all right, the Ghostbusters show up to bust you. Mm-hmm. You tell them. Oh, sorry

09:05.680 --> 09:07.680
I understand confusion

09:07.680 --> 09:12.520
I'm a human pretending to be a ghost. Yeah ghost catfishing. I'm ghost fishing

09:13.320 --> 09:15.320
They say haha ghost

09:16.000 --> 09:20.480
Oldest trick in the book. You don't think slime are trying that shit. We've tried this one

09:20.480 --> 09:26.960
We've seen this one many many times before you are a ghost busting makes me feel good add it up

09:27.880 --> 09:30.640
and and those proton beams those uh

09:31.680 --> 09:36.100
Those don't just like make you twirl around and when and sparks shoot off of you

09:36.100 --> 09:38.900
Those will lathe you in half, okay

09:38.900 --> 09:44.340
So we can all agree that there is a circumstance in which the Ghostbusters have accidentally murdered people almost

09:44.820 --> 09:50.740
certainly almost break into the bus busting HQ late at night and and

09:51.100 --> 09:58.180
Winston's jumpy. He's like, whoa, who's that? And then he opens his bedroom door blast. Oops. Oops. Sorry

09:58.180 --> 10:03.500
I know why would you jump on just Winston who is my favorite ghost? Yeah. Yeah, Justin. You want to explain that?

10:03.500 --> 10:07.380
Well, why I just I thought he might be near the front door

10:08.020 --> 10:10.780
Makes I don't know what cuz he was the last Ghostbusters. So he

10:11.700 --> 10:13.340
Is bad. Yeah, she is bad

10:13.340 --> 10:17.460
Everybody else wants to be on the second floor above them so they can use the pole, you know

10:17.460 --> 10:25.020
And they know immediately when they fucked up to right because you kill you kill the woman and then she's just there again

10:25.420 --> 10:27.400
But in a different form now

10:27.400 --> 10:32.140
You do need to bust that because she she has been murdered in a horrible manner

10:32.140 --> 10:35.900
And then it just goes down in the books as a pre-emptive busting. Yeah

10:36.500 --> 10:39.580
That's a good point Travis. It's a causal busting

10:40.820 --> 10:42.820
Not premeditated not premeditated

10:43.580 --> 10:45.580
accidental causal busting

10:46.340 --> 10:52.540
So we hope you you know what? You don't need to scare people off. Just be cool. Listen, honest to God

10:52.540 --> 10:54.540
I've never snuck into anything ever

10:54.540 --> 11:02.000
But I can imagine that if I snuck onto something and somebody with a flashlight period were to say hey get off

11:02.000 --> 11:07.220
I'd be like, oh, yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. You guys cursing a lot is good too. That one's on me

11:07.220 --> 11:13.400
I'm not supposed to be here and I recognize that I am a dork. Yeah, it seems weird that people wouldn't just like

11:13.960 --> 11:20.180
Leave I don't know. I would be so frightened. I hear anyone who tries to argue like no, I'm I'm supposed to be here

11:20.180 --> 11:21.860
I'm on the list

11:21.860 --> 11:27.580
I'm on the historic boat list if you could take a look eyes. Just think you throw a good throaty curse at them and

11:28.140 --> 11:31.500
They're gone. So what's more scary if somebody shines a flashlight on you in a place?

11:31.500 --> 11:35.620
You're not supposed to be he's like hey get out of here. Like hey get the fuck out of here. You're gone

11:35.620 --> 11:41.340
You've been out. You're done. I'll eat your fucking eyeballs. Oh, they hired a Frankenstein. Yeah

11:42.060 --> 11:48.600
Yeah, no noise that scary could come but they captured they took the history shit back in time to win Frankenstein was

11:48.600 --> 11:51.600
And they captured him 1991

11:59.600 --> 12:03.200
When Frankenstein had that hit song I'm too sexy for my shirt, right?

12:03.480 --> 12:08.200
That's how you know, that's how you know your child in the 90s. You remember when Frankenstein was alive

12:08.200 --> 12:13.280
It's one reason to know if you were a child in the 90s Frankenstein killed your sister. I

12:13.280 --> 12:17.280
I will say that

12:18.480 --> 12:22.160
Kicking it at Cheesecake Factory on Sunday morning

12:22.760 --> 12:26.680
The day of the morning of my brother's wedding, which was kind of a weird experience for me

12:26.680 --> 12:30.040
I was the most dressed up anyone's ever been inside a Cheesecake Factory ever

12:30.960 --> 12:33.480
Felt a little bit out of place a little bit fish out of water

12:34.040 --> 12:40.080
Was that before after I made you drive back to my house to get my special Travis made us get his special wedding night underwear

12:40.080 --> 12:45.400
And I had to look at them. I had to get them. I had to get them from the underwear spot

12:45.720 --> 12:50.840
Where he kept all of the things and I had to get it and I touched them to yeah

12:50.840 --> 12:55.640
They acknowledge that they I had to I had to okay. Here's the order. I learned about them

12:55.640 --> 13:02.460
I said that's terrible. Then I learned that I would have to retrieve touch. No feel believe hold grasp

13:03.200 --> 13:04.720
acknowledge

13:04.720 --> 13:06.720
become

13:06.720 --> 13:11.920
Embrace absorb and now you guys are doing that at home. They were silky as fuck

13:11.920 --> 13:17.880
No, they were silky and they were black and they were black just a little bit sheer just a little bit sheer

13:17.880 --> 13:22.080
So I just felt just like I'm a little bit dead now. I acknowledged that they existed

13:22.080 --> 13:27.720
I had to touch my balls women thought about Travis thought about Travis's balls how they would feel inside of them

13:27.720 --> 13:34.500
I had to acknowledge the moment where Travis decided to get special wedding underwear then go to a store

13:34.500 --> 13:37.900
Possibly with his bride-to-be had to think had to learn a lot about

13:38.980 --> 13:42.740
Impulse by it was a lot more of an impulse by where I looked and I said, you know

13:42.740 --> 13:49.340
That's gonna feel real good to learn a lot about Teresa that I didn't know and the things that she prefers there

13:49.780 --> 13:51.380
around there

13:51.380 --> 13:58.540
Terrific best wedding ever here. Let me rewrite all of my best man speech because I have new fucking subjects

13:58.540 --> 13:59.940
I need to address

13:59.940 --> 14:05.140
I'm gonna wait. I'm gonna go pop up music behind the behind the music for a minute. Don't say pop-up

14:05.740 --> 14:11.140
Pop up video behind the music. I bought the wedding underpants not for a sexy bent

14:11.140 --> 14:17.500
But because I knew the silky smooth material would prevent any chafing day of which I didn't want to deal with as I'm walking down

14:17.500 --> 14:19.500
the aisle

14:21.220 --> 14:26.780
The decision to buy special sexy wedding underwear may have been an impulse by

14:26.780 --> 14:33.260
The the decision to send your brother to go get your special wedding

14:35.540 --> 14:37.300
And it was malicious

14:37.300 --> 14:43.980
It was a combination of because I knew that if I didn't I would think about it all day because that's the way my brain

14:43.980 --> 14:48.180
Works like how well my rather I think about it all day and then to all life

14:48.180 --> 14:51.460
It was funny to me to make Griffin. Yeah, it sure was I guess

14:51.460 --> 14:56.340
Your kids in here man, you said whoever you want to go get your special wedding underwear

14:57.540 --> 15:03.100
But now it's it's kind of nice because for the times like when we get sick or one of us is ill and we move

15:03.100 --> 15:06.500
The TV into the bedroom. It really does become an anchor

15:06.500 --> 15:06.980
No

15:06.980 --> 15:07.380
Yeah

15:07.380 --> 15:12.940
Keeps you in bed or brings you to bed early and you don't really do a lot of shit at least in the living room

15:12.980 --> 15:19.220
You do more stuff like I can work on the computer while the TV is on or I feel like at least I'm sitting up

15:19.220 --> 15:25.060
Or walking with a terrifying. Well, I mean what if the darkness creeps up on you while you're in your bedroom?

15:25.060 --> 15:27.420
And you're trying to get dressed. Like what do you do then? I

15:28.260 --> 15:31.220
Sing a little song to myself about how lucky I am to be alive

15:35.620 --> 15:41.620
God I'm not dead because the world would be empty without me. Okay

15:42.700 --> 15:47.420
Usually kind of then devolves from there into how awesome about how great you are. Yeah, sure sure boy

15:47.420 --> 15:52.740
I think we're all pretty lucky Travis is still kicking. I just assume everyone sings a song like that. Thank you

15:52.740 --> 15:54.740
God for Travis

15:55.100 --> 16:01.500
Where would I be with the Sun in the sky and the stars at night who guides me home on the chop?

16:01.500 --> 16:05.800
He sees thank Jesus for Travis Travis is Jesus and they just kind of

16:05.800 --> 16:16.200
Thank you Travis for Travis is all-seeing power. Thank you Travis for Travis

16:18.960 --> 16:21.520
People don't write enough hymns about themselves

16:23.680 --> 16:25.680
But up to the first stands of him

16:26.080 --> 16:33.040
341 thank Travis for Travis and Travis is Travis our hearts are all Travis and brains are Travis to

16:33.040 --> 16:40.560
Third stanza. I need some thank Travis for Travis propaganda posters

16:44.640 --> 16:47.520
You know Travis I I feel like there's been this narrative

16:47.920 --> 16:51.900
Among some of our listenership that you don't get the respect that you deserve on this show

16:52.120 --> 16:55.600
So like I'm all about like I don't know canonizing you

16:55.600 --> 17:00.120
I also I also want to point out one of the reasons that happens is I don't really need it

17:00.120 --> 17:06.720
I take care of that on my own. Yeah, the other thing is like that it is a little bit of that on Travis goes quite

17:06.720 --> 17:10.000
A long way. That's a visit Travis McElroy calm

17:11.400 --> 17:13.400
McElroy needs

17:13.800 --> 17:18.880
In a moment of weakness and lacking insight from the brothers wise I agreed to let my nephew move into my basement

17:19.200 --> 17:25.040
He's in a band. He pays no rent eats all our food leaves messes and generally acts like a 14 year old

17:25.040 --> 17:30.280
How can I get him to pack up his bags and move away? That's from Carl the grumpy old man in Lincoln, Nebraska

17:31.520 --> 17:33.520
Is he 14 years old?

17:33.760 --> 17:36.600
That's a really good question. I don't understand how all this lines up

17:37.640 --> 17:39.760
Okay, there's a if he's 32

17:40.320 --> 17:44.280
Yeah, there's a much different question than if he's like 19, you know

17:44.800 --> 17:48.960
It's so rare that you get to do something nice for somebody like this

17:49.440 --> 17:53.920
You you could I could connive a few ways for you to get rid of them, you know, like

17:53.920 --> 17:58.960
I mean, there's fake ghosts fake haunting races. That's easy

18:00.960 --> 18:03.000
Light them gas light home

18:03.000 --> 18:10.080
That's just every day remove one article of something from their room and put it like in storage or move it to an apartment

18:10.080 --> 18:15.880
There's gonna be a really long-term plan, but like just one sock, you know on Monday and then like a

18:16.640 --> 18:19.640
CD on Tuesday and just slowly move them out of the house

18:19.640 --> 18:25.400
Can you start an even louder band on the top floor?

18:25.680 --> 18:28.960
Do you know I mean like he thinks if he's rocking all day and night on

18:29.640 --> 18:31.560
his his strat

18:31.560 --> 18:38.480
Then maybe you buy an even bigger Marshall stack point that towards the ground and just start like laying down some like kidney stone

18:38.760 --> 18:45.600
Rattling bass riffs. Oh, I love this and if whatever their band is called you call your band that but bigger, right?

18:45.600 --> 18:50.720
So if his band is perfect death, it's like we're perfect dirt death. Er, er

18:52.680 --> 18:58.300
More perfect death and then you get incredibly popular you buy him his own house

18:59.000 --> 19:03.480
Behind your house. Oh, no, I have to entourage this shit. Why would you want it?

19:03.480 --> 19:06.240
If you went to all the trouble of buying him another house

19:06.440 --> 19:11.800
You don't get him the money to buy another plot of land so you can only build him a small doll house in your butt

19:11.800 --> 19:13.800
She still love him. You don't want to be you love him

19:13.800 --> 19:18.720
You don't want to be too far away, but you will have you will have a witch cast a spell on him to make him

19:18.720 --> 19:20.720
Little enough to live in a dollhouse

19:20.880 --> 19:26.720
This is this is called the candor is what is that we have you put him in a bottle city that you keep in your den

19:26.800 --> 19:30.400
Why have you not told him to stop being a dipshit?

19:31.080 --> 19:36.960
Yeah, life has to tell you that you know the guy who owns your house gets to tell you that I'm pretty sure

19:37.520 --> 19:40.360
Like our dad always told us when we were being idiots

19:40.360 --> 19:43.600
You're his dad now because you own his hat you in the house, right?

19:45.000 --> 19:50.360
Like any sitcom in which like a non direct family member or friend moves in

19:50.800 --> 19:56.460
You you now are responsible for them like a parent. That's what the Matthews did for Cory. I'm sorry, Sean

19:56.560 --> 19:58.900
Cory was their son or like in in

19:59.740 --> 20:03.240
Step by step. I believe it was Cody and then flash you got

20:03.240 --> 20:10.840
Like your child fresh Prince of Bel-Air him. There you go. You've got you're the uncle Phil to his fresh Prince of Bel-Air

20:10.840 --> 20:16.240
How to uncle fill him with your love, but you kind of want to have a girl sound says to me like you want to DJ

20:16.240 --> 20:18.240
Jazzy Jeff

20:18.840 --> 20:22.720
That's what you okay, this is the conversation you sit down say you need to make a decision right now

20:22.720 --> 20:26.640
Are you gonna be my fresh Prince of Bel-Air? Are you going to be my DJ Jazzy Jeff?

20:26.640 --> 20:32.680
I'm I can if he doesn't get the reference out. He goes he's obviously a Jeff. This is what I'm saying

20:32.680 --> 20:34.320
It is

20:34.320 --> 20:41.440
Will Smith the I think fresh will was his name just will in the show. Yes. Yeah some bullshit

20:41.440 --> 20:46.080
He couldn't it was well, it was Williams William any um, that was his name

20:47.680 --> 20:49.360
William any um

20:49.360 --> 20:55.400
Represented a pretty tremendous that you go back and watch that show pretty tremendous amount of character growth. Mm-hmm

20:55.400 --> 21:00.920
Oh throughout the run of fresh Prince DJ Jazzy Jeff was was almost belligerently stagnant

21:00.920 --> 21:04.800
Well, did we figure he was thrown on his head several times, right?

21:05.200 --> 21:09.760
So, I mean I there definitely is a physiological element to it. I'm just saying that DJ

21:09.760 --> 21:11.120
Just jazz is Jeff

21:11.120 --> 21:12.920
dishes by the end

21:12.920 --> 21:17.200
And the series finale like we're going to go to college now and he was like

21:17.200 --> 21:22.840
I just want to party all night long and then he puts on line where she's all night long because he's like fucking stuck

21:22.880 --> 21:27.320
You know, I mean, right? Yes now he has no opportunity for he has nothing

21:27.320 --> 21:33.880
Also, did he ever DJ on that show fucking once ever and ever?

21:33.880 --> 21:35.920
I don't think so. I believe he did

21:36.960 --> 21:41.840
There is a an episode in which will rent out the house for a music video and I believe

21:42.000 --> 21:48.640
DJ Jazzy Jeff sneaks in and he's doing a little mixing on the old one and twos. That's fun. That's a fun

21:48.640 --> 21:53.560
That's a fun episode how frustrating must it be to be a genuine like actual musical artist

21:53.560 --> 21:59.240
But for a generation of white people you are that guy that got thrown out of the house

22:00.240 --> 22:02.920
like no, I have like a whole career before this you got

22:04.440 --> 22:10.320
And before we get right in I just remembered that I believe it was not will that rented out the house

22:10.320 --> 22:15.840
He was trying to stop it from happening. In fact Carlton rented out the house. That seems not like Carlton

22:16.360 --> 22:20.360
Now was that was that the same episode? Was that the same episode where Carlton bought a gun?

22:20.360 --> 22:28.840
Yeah, that was a real good one that was Carlton's like Breaking Bad the entire series in one episode for him the best episode

22:28.840 --> 22:33.760
I think is the one where will has to convince Carlton that racism exists. Did you guys?

22:35.480 --> 22:42.400
He was driving slowly and he got pulled over and he thought it's because he was driving so slowly and well, so there's like no

22:43.280 --> 22:49.160
Racism exists and it blows Carlton's mind because he's never experienced it before in his life

22:49.160 --> 22:55.920
No, that's like a that's not like a fun. That's not like a laugh a minute episode. It goes like really hard

22:55.920 --> 22:59.280
It's actually pretty they go fucking hard on that show. We give that show

22:59.280 --> 23:05.360
I'm just saying that we goof we goof about that show because it's called Fresh Prince of Bel Air and there's a character on it

23:05.360 --> 23:10.720
Called DJ Jazzy Jeff. They tackle some fucking heady heady subjects

23:10.720 --> 23:19.160
There's an amazing episode in which will goes off about like his dad leave it. Oh, yeah, they'll rock you to your very core. I

23:19.320 --> 23:21.320
Have a problem with speaking up. I

23:21.680 --> 23:25.720
Frequently have to repeat myself and people often tell me that I talk too quietly

23:26.120 --> 23:31.620
When I increase the volume, it feels like I'm yelling or that my voice takes on an unpleasant or harsh tone

23:31.840 --> 23:37.640
What can I do to make sure that I'm being heard without feeling as though I'm shouting in people's faces. That's from whispering in Wisconsin

23:37.640 --> 23:42.400
I know that problem. No, you don't know. No, no. No, here's the thing

23:43.160 --> 23:44.640
surprising to most

23:44.640 --> 23:50.440
while I am very loud and verbose when like telling a story or a joke or entertaining people are ordering food at a

23:50.560 --> 23:53.840
Restaurant or but here's the thing half the time

23:53.840 --> 23:59.080
I mumble out my order or half the time is I want to ask somebody a question. I don't like

23:59.720 --> 24:07.120
Annunciate I say a really quiet and kind of humbly and it's either one of those two is I'm either super loud or like really

24:07.120 --> 24:13.600
Awkward and quiet and mumbly and Teresa calls me on this all the time and it's like there is no middle ground for me

24:13.600 --> 24:19.560
Yeah, you never sound normal. Yeah, no never not really. I'm surprised you you have found a

24:20.560 --> 24:27.520
Fair amount of success. I would say in this audio only medium while I have my phone turned down to 1%

24:28.320 --> 24:33.000
Yeah, and even now like even that when you said percent you're popping your plosives you're shouting

24:33.000 --> 24:36.280
You don't even know that you're shouting right now, but the people listening like is he mad at me?

24:36.280 --> 24:39.480
I think this is not a fun podcast as an experience for me

24:39.920 --> 24:44.400
Travis is basically three quarters of the way to an SNL character, right? Correct. I

24:45.400 --> 24:49.240
Mean, it looks like Chris Catan. That's not fair Travis. I'm sorry. I said that no

24:50.520 --> 24:55.660
You got a whole beer going on. He can't grow a beard. Yeah, take back a tan not since the fire

24:55.760 --> 25:01.480
Just talk a little louder. You guys don't need us for these. No, here's the thing. No, here's the thing

25:01.480 --> 25:08.000
I think there's an I can infer a problem here and I think the problem is not that they're jumping from like

25:08.360 --> 25:15.560
Quiet to loud. It's that when he speaks at a normal volume or she speaks at a normal volume. They feel loud

25:16.440 --> 25:23.200
which I think that that point is more of a self-confidence about either your speaking voice because you feel like it's harsh and

25:23.680 --> 25:27.040
Unpleasant or you feel like you're yelling and being boisterous

25:27.040 --> 25:33.040
I think that it comes from an inherent fear of voicing your opinions and saying what you need

25:33.040 --> 25:37.520
Let me help you out here. Your problem is that you're you're yelling from your your head

25:37.920 --> 25:42.620
You need it. Where's your power? A lot of people ask me that Justin. Where's my power in my vagina? Okay

25:43.800 --> 25:47.880
It's it's down deep in your diaphragm. That's where you got to push the sound from right now

25:48.360 --> 25:50.720
You can't see it, but I've got

25:51.480 --> 25:54.920
several leather restraints wrapped around my stomach to help me

25:54.920 --> 26:00.680
Remember to always be pushing air out of my diaphragm. I literally have no room to exhale

26:00.680 --> 26:05.480
I'm waiting until after the show to exhale right wait to exhale. I'm waiting to exhale, right?

26:05.480 --> 26:12.960
Oh, they're also there for sex stuff. There are sex stuff related adjacent their sex adjacent. I would say yeah sex adjacent

26:12.960 --> 26:15.880
It's amazing. Those two things don't have to be mutually exclusive

26:16.000 --> 26:19.240
It can both be good for your support and for your sex stuff

26:19.240 --> 26:23.760
This helps me talk good in public and also the chafing does things

26:23.760 --> 26:25.760
vis-a-vis boners

26:27.480 --> 26:29.720
You know sex stuff that is a good point though

26:29.720 --> 26:33.600
Cuz you learn in theater the ability to like support and not yell

26:33.600 --> 26:39.080
Well, you're gonna react and you can be confident without like yelling to the back of the theater

26:39.080 --> 26:42.440
So I think that's it. Just support yourself with air feel confident what you say

26:43.200 --> 26:45.600
Let me uh, let me let me perform a quick demonstration

26:46.320 --> 26:48.320
Terrific. I can't wait for this

26:48.600 --> 26:51.080
This is me speaking with my normal voice

26:51.080 --> 26:58.240
But you can hear all of this sound is coming from my mouth and my neck

27:01.680 --> 27:07.440
Your neck meat that makes the sound my neck meat is filtering the sound waves out through what?

27:07.840 --> 27:11.380
Scientists call this the shout hole your your moist

27:11.560 --> 27:16.640
Your moist cords are slapping together like two fish just throwing together at a fish market

27:16.640 --> 27:21.880
So this is just my normal. This is all with without any other support. Yeah

27:30.600 --> 27:34.680
Justin I'm in the back of the theater. I'm in the back of the theater and I'm hearing every word of that

27:35.920 --> 27:41.440
Diaphragm have an accent. It's just from the sound being pushed out

27:41.440 --> 27:45.660
Oh, that's painful, yeah

27:49.440 --> 27:51.920
It hurts act that's why they pay them so much

27:51.920 --> 27:57.920
It's not easy

28:05.800 --> 28:13.280

beautiful a couple of announcements we got a pin on the month and the pin on the month is for work of fart and

30:24.880 --> 30:28.680
That one that one slipped through my dragnet usually, you know

30:28.680 --> 30:36.960
If there's a piece of merch coming down the pipe that I'm like, that's this isn't fancy elegant like adult way like adult kit

30:36.960 --> 30:42.000
Um, then I will you know, I have veto power but this one I was you know

30:42.000 --> 30:44.640
I was playing a lot of Final Fantasy 14

30:44.640 --> 30:49.560
I was busy and I didn't even see it and then I looked on our website and said work of fart right there

30:49.560 --> 30:55.760
And I went to I went to Travis and I went to Sarah our merch designer and I was like, hey

30:57.280 --> 31:02.080
What what's up and they were like, it's it's really funny and then I looked at it and you know what they were right

31:02.080 --> 31:07.440
And so then I learned a little something about myself and guess what work of fart the pin it

31:07.680 --> 31:11.600

31:11.880 --> 31:18.000

Travis's ongoing fart joke is helping to put trees in the world

31:27.320 --> 31:28.480

31:53.960 --> 32:00.520
My life is better with you. You can find it at bit.ly slash montaigne my bim-bam. That's M. O. N. T. A. I

32:01.400 --> 32:05.560
G. N. E. M. B. M. B. A. M. That came out on Friday. It's so good

32:05.720 --> 32:09.840
We're really we're really happy with it. Oh and the whole song is out there now, too

32:09.920 --> 32:16.240
You've only heard the first verse and I guess the ending but there's a middle part that you're just gonna go wild for

32:17.080 --> 32:22.900
That's it. Enjoy the rest of them the bros better. We'll be back with a new episode next week until then

32:22.900 --> 32:24.900
Arrivederci

32:27.940 --> 32:32.740
From the internationally acclaimed creators of who shot you comes the movie podcast

32:33.660 --> 32:39.660
Maximum film starring producer and film festival programmer Drea Clark as a woman bound by passion

32:39.660 --> 32:45.860
I saw this eight months ago on the festival circuit and I loved it film critic Alonzo de Rolde as a man

32:46.140 --> 32:52.500
Corrupted by greed why watch one home or Christmas movie when I can watch seven and comedian if you waddyway as a man

32:52.500 --> 32:55.380
Protecting a love that society simply won't accept

32:55.380 --> 33:01.540
I think Pacific Rim is a perfect movie and if you can't accept that I want you out of my life from the makers of

33:01.540 --> 33:05.460
The movie podcast who shot you comes maximum film. That's right

33:05.460 --> 33:08.660
We changed the name of our show to maximum film, but don't worry

33:08.660 --> 33:12.660
We're still a movie review show that isn't just a bunch of straight white dudes

33:12.660 --> 33:18.500
So tune into maximum film at maximum fun org or wherever you get your podcasts

33:18.500 --> 33:20.500
You

33:21.220 --> 33:25.260
How about a yahoo hit me so I'm standing by drew Davenport, thank you drew

33:25.860 --> 33:29.620
Test by yahoo answers user DS who asks best battle ever

33:31.780 --> 33:36.900
Takes place in the same area that Goku fought Vegeta the first time

33:37.540 --> 33:41.580
So not not their final battle. We're talking about the first

33:41.580 --> 33:48.740
Right way the first one the premier Goku V Vegeta where we're not the first time Goku fought fajita

33:48.740 --> 33:50.740
Okay, got it. Go ahead

33:50.860 --> 33:56.980
so this is in the religion and spirituality section, so we're talking about Jeremiah the

33:57.780 --> 34:01.300
The prophet the weeping prophet, you know him

34:01.980 --> 34:03.980
You might know him from Kings

34:04.620 --> 34:09.100
50 foot robot Jeremiah with laser eyes and the mobility of eight ten

34:09.100 --> 34:14.860
Ability to fly but only for three minutes before a charge up of five minutes low-class shields and five rockets

34:15.140 --> 34:19.420
machine gun 200 bullets a mag one minute reload time and unlimited mags

34:19.860 --> 34:21.860
versus uh-huh

34:21.980 --> 34:26.620
75 foot Alan Rickman with tentacles for arms and beefy legs mobility of

34:27.060 --> 34:32.260
Five out of ten and mid-class shields machine gun fire from suckers and tentacles

34:32.460 --> 34:37.860
Reload and mag size the same as above unlimited mags and mouth laser equivalent to three eye lasers

34:37.860 --> 34:42.460
Added bonus that he can jump two hundred feet higher than Jeremiah can fly

34:42.620 --> 34:48.080
But can also smash the ground with the power of three missiles, but can only do it twice or his shields will break

34:49.780 --> 34:55.180
Jesus such a good question. It's a really tough one. You got Jeremiah in one corner author of first and second Kings

34:56.220 --> 35:00.980
Wait, is it possible that by Jeremiah they mean Jeremy Irons? No, they mean Jeremiah

35:01.900 --> 35:04.340
creator of that joint hit lamentations

35:04.340 --> 35:09.620
Because I would love to see a battle between giant Jeremy Irons. No, no Alan Rickman

35:09.620 --> 35:15.700
I don't get the connection between Jeremiah and Alan Rickman. This person needed to put this question somewhere

35:16.380 --> 35:22.060
Religion and spirituality I imagine is a pretty good place for like getting answers on your Yahoo mysteries

35:23.120 --> 35:29.060
So he had to get some Bible shit in there somewhere. We got Jeremiah. Do you need the stats again 50 feet Jeremiah?

35:29.140 --> 35:31.220
He's eight out of ten speed. That's pretty fast

35:31.220 --> 35:37.020
He can fly but only for three minutes to charge up for five. So it's not like an unlimited thing Alan Rickman can't fly

35:37.020 --> 35:40.380
He does have tentacle machine-gun arms. He can't jump super high though

35:40.380 --> 35:43.820
And when he pounds the ground it has the strength of three missiles can't do that more than twice

35:43.820 --> 35:49.180
So or his shields will break though. Can they call him thing? I know about Jeremiah. Mm-hmm

35:49.180 --> 35:55.220
It's that he was a bullfrog don't know. Come on, and he was a good friend of Justin start talking

35:55.220 --> 35:57.440
I think that the can they call it can they call in?

35:57.440 --> 36:03.260
Reinforcements can Jeremiah call in another biblical prophet can Jeremiah call in like

36:04.320 --> 36:07.360
Matthew or mark or Luke and Alan Rickman can call it. I don't know like

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
Jason Isaac Janine Garofalo. Hello, Jason Isaac's join me

36:12.640 --> 36:16.760
Take one of my tentacle arms dislodge it from my body and use it to defend yourself

36:16.760 --> 36:23.600
So your problem with this question is that there's not enough specificity and the powers that have been allotted to Jeremiah the biblical

36:23.600 --> 36:26.920
Prophet and Alan Rickman who was right?

36:27.040 --> 36:34.200
I'm saying they are they still human or is this like a mecha like Voltron? I think we might be looking at an Ultraman scenario

36:35.200 --> 36:39.860
so robotic cyber Alan Rickman, I think in this situation Jeremiah is

36:41.640 --> 36:46.420
Is Ultraman and I think Alan Rickman might be the the kaiju

36:47.280 --> 36:50.160
Gotcha. I'm gonna have to go Alan Rickman every time

36:50.160 --> 36:53.280
He it does work. He has a significant height advantage

36:53.760 --> 36:58.400
He's slower and that's I think the only thing that Jeremiah has going from that extra three points of speed

36:58.400 --> 37:03.560
It's gonna fucking count on the battle, but he can he can jump and hit the ground with the power of three missiles

37:04.000 --> 37:09.560
That's true. But Jeremiah has five rockets. So you throw you throw Alan Rickman in the air?

37:09.560 --> 37:11.560
You're basically like skeet shooting at that point

37:11.880 --> 37:19.360
Yeah, and you think you think Alan Rickman's about to win but then Jeremiah finds the locket that Alan Rickman bought for his secretary in

37:19.360 --> 37:22.320
His coat pocket and he gets so pissed. He gets fucking

37:22.840 --> 37:27.120
Angry, and then he turns around it turns the whole battle around and Jeremiah brings him down

37:27.840 --> 37:34.600
Then Jeremiah reaches behind between his shoulder blades and pulls the gun that he had duct-taped there and shoots Alan Rickman

37:34.600 --> 37:38.880
Well, he didn't do that out the window. Oh, he did do that. No. Yeah, you're right

37:38.880 --> 38:08.520
Um, no, that was in Lamentations that was in Lamentations 5-6. Yippee-ki-yay. Holy father. Got one a yahoo answer. Yeah, I'm into that. This yahoo answer was sent in by Alan Black. Thank you Alan Black. A very prolific contributor. So that's about yahoo answer's user SlickNinja360 who asks? Should be good. Should be pretty good. Would it?

38:08.880 --> 38:16.240
Be illegal to go into the middle of a forest and build a maze forcing people to traverse it upon entry.

38:20.480 --> 38:26.320
I guess yeah, I guess that's pretty good. Upon entry the entrance would close it would have spikes on the walls tops

38:26.760 --> 38:28.760
To keep them from escaping.

38:29.400 --> 38:32.120
I was also thinking of having booby traps and things like that

38:33.000 --> 38:35.640
Once they find the exit they could leave.

38:35.640 --> 38:47.320
I don't know about illegal, but logistically it seems like an issue. Yeah, you're gonna have to have some fucking. Is it a motorized gate or like a magical that grows over when they walk through? It's gonna be a fucking pan's labyrinth magic moss.

38:47.320 --> 38:59.080
I will say if we can't fix gun laws, but we have been thorough enough to figure out our forest maze laws. I might be very disappointed in our nation.

38:59.080 --> 39:06.320
If you if if you own the land, and this is troubling because I'm agreeing with the top yahoo response to this

39:06.320 --> 39:12.520
But if you own the land you can build a maze wherever the fuck you want. I don't know that you can corral people into it.

39:12.520 --> 39:18.200
That's where you run into. You can leave a trail of peppermints. There's no guarantee.

39:18.200 --> 39:25.920
This is the beautiful thing about it. If you force people to do it highly illegal. Yeah, if you offer people the opportunity to do it, highly profitable.

39:25.920 --> 39:31.000
Yeah, I can't like I just bought a house and I feel like I have total agency over it.

39:31.000 --> 39:38.200
I do not think I can invite friends in and then lock the door and then swallow the key and say I will let you out as soon as you solve my puzzle of flesh.

39:38.200 --> 39:44.440
And then I would show them my flesh puzzle. Here's the funny thing about luring.

39:44.440 --> 39:58.280
Is the flesh puzzle your genitals? That's my balls. I would bet that 80 to 90 percent of the people in this room if you stumbled upon what you were guaranteed to be a solvable forest maze.

39:58.280 --> 40:01.800
That would lock you in and you would you would fucking die if you couldn't solve it.

40:01.800 --> 40:06.680
If? That's a big if Griffin. How many of you would say? All right. Yeah, I'll tackle this bitch.

40:06.680 --> 40:12.760
This is everything I've ever trained for. Everybody raise your hand. If you stumbled upon a pan's labyrinth.

40:12.760 --> 40:17.480
This is serious. You would not. OK, there's a lot of people raising their hands.

40:17.480 --> 40:21.480
You would risk your life. All those years of playing Professor Layton games are finally going to pay off.

40:21.480 --> 40:27.640
You're going to solve this shit. What what would lure you into? OK, what would lure me into a forest maze?

40:27.640 --> 40:35.880
The seeing the opening of a fucking forest maze. Right. You got it. What if it's risk your life, though?

40:35.880 --> 40:42.520
I don't want you know what? The fourth verse of Tim McGraw's Live Like You Were Dying directly references.

40:42.520 --> 40:52.760
I went into every forest maze I saw. I think. I heard a pan flute beckoning me in.

40:52.760 --> 41:01.800
But there was gold doubloons at the end. Spite traps weren't scaring me away.

41:01.800 --> 41:08.040
Have you ever heard that song? Have you ever heard the song? I'm not great with melodies.

41:08.040 --> 41:12.840
That's actually I was singing the harmony. I thought someone would join in.

41:12.840 --> 41:19.800
Dear brothers, ice cream trucks never pass where I live, ever. Oh, so sorry.

41:19.800 --> 41:25.320
This is a problem. All right. Ice truck ice cream trucks never pass where I live, ever.

41:25.320 --> 41:31.400
Today, I heard one outside and I booked it out the door. He was driving away from me, but I finally caught up with him.

41:31.400 --> 41:40.200
Well done. Good work. When those things don't drive especially fast, but still kudos to you, I suppose.

41:40.200 --> 41:46.120
Faster than human land speed. I guess. You earned your dilly bar. When I bought my ice. How old am I?

41:46.120 --> 41:50.520
When I bought my ice cream, the ice cream guy just gave me this incredulous face and seemed to be annoyed

41:50.520 --> 41:55.640
that a 20-ish year old would be so excited. You know your age, right? I'm guessing.

41:55.640 --> 42:01.720
Yeah, but I was left on a doorstep. It's good storytelling. He's not like forcing omnipotence

42:01.720 --> 42:06.600
and omniscience onto the ice cream truck driver. Would be so excited about an ice cream truck.

42:06.600 --> 42:12.600
Am I too old to be excited about ice cream trucks or was the ice cream guy just a downer?

42:12.600 --> 42:17.960
And that's from vexed in Ventura question for you audience. Vexed in Ventura, are you here?

42:17.960 --> 42:27.400
Hey, welcome. If you're an ice cream driver and it's 2014 and you're in LA, how good is business

42:27.400 --> 42:34.280
that you can fucking get judgy on people? I don't know. It feels like you should go,

42:34.280 --> 42:40.600
do you want anything else? Yeah, please. Also, can you think of anything else cold that I could sell

42:40.600 --> 42:46.440
because I'm dying here. Let's do a quick poll of the audience. This is interesting. In the last,

42:46.440 --> 42:52.680
let's say three months, has anybody seen an ice cream truck that was stationary and selling its

42:52.680 --> 42:57.560
product to anybody? Just a quick show of hands, stationary. Okay, more than I thought. Better

42:57.560 --> 43:02.120
question. I'll be the first to admit that I fucked up with my judgment. I haven't seen a stationary

43:02.120 --> 43:06.760
ice cream every time it's just like slowly crawling at five miles an hour. It's like anybody.

43:06.760 --> 43:10.040
And I'm not talking, by the way, I want to clarify, I'm not talking about a food truck.

43:10.040 --> 43:14.040
No, no, no. You know what I'm talking about. Ice cream. I'm not talking about our keys and all

43:14.040 --> 43:21.720
like, it's got avocados in it. And that's what you sound like food truck drivers, I guess.

43:21.720 --> 43:26.680
I don't know what the ice cream truck environment is like here, but I know what it's like in

43:26.680 --> 43:33.640
Cincinnati. When you see said ice cream trucks, is the paint peeling and the pictures faded and

43:33.640 --> 43:38.920
it looks like they just killed- And sometimes they've got like Pikachu on it and it's like,

43:38.920 --> 43:44.120
hey guys, um, let me just like call Nintendo real quick. Yeah, you didn't like go through

43:44.120 --> 43:50.120
the right fucking channels to get fucking Pikachu to sell your iced wares.

43:53.480 --> 44:00.920
I would, I would feel uncomfortable and only because I would be so worried that I would come

44:00.920 --> 44:07.800
up from vector A and sort of like in my periphery out of nowhere would be a kid on vector B and we

44:07.800 --> 44:12.440
would arrive at the same time. And you would force the issue like- I was here first. You know,

44:12.440 --> 44:17.480
I was here first, right? Hold on. We got, sorry gents, we got one push pop left. Looks like you're

44:17.480 --> 44:22.120
gonna have to wrestle for it. Sweet. You're really little and I'm really big. You just want to give

44:22.120 --> 44:27.320
it to me? I would grab their head and just push it below the window so the guy couldn't see them

44:27.320 --> 44:34.120
until I was done purchasing my novelties. Have you guys noticed that the only people on fucking

44:34.120 --> 44:38.040
earth that call them novelties at the grocery store? They used to confuse the hell out of me

44:38.040 --> 44:42.200
when I was a kid. What's a novel- just say ice cream shit. We all know what you're talking about.

44:42.200 --> 44:49.320
You don't have to get fucking fancy, Kroger. So you guys want a yahoo? Absolutely. So yahoo was,

44:49.320 --> 44:56.360
um, so yahoo was sent in by a man named Drew Davenport, a legend one might say. Thank you,

44:56.360 --> 45:04.520
Drew. It's by yahoo answer's user Pineapple Lifesaver who asks, why do so many people buy

45:04.520 --> 45:11.320
Lunchables? You could put your own together for a lot cheaper. Just put some meat, cheese,

45:11.320 --> 45:20.040
and crackers in a Gladware container. Uh, well fucking thanks, Einstein. Update, it's not cheaper

45:20.040 --> 45:24.040
though for the tiny handful of food that you get even at one dollar. They're using the cheapest

45:24.040 --> 45:29.160
quality of ingredients. Buying some cheap turkey, American singles, and Ritz Saltines will give you

45:29.160 --> 45:35.000
the same amount of 10 or more Lunchables for half the cost. Holy shit, that can't possibly be right.

45:35.640 --> 45:40.360
All right, first off, blasphemy. They're saying 10 or more Lunchables for half the cost. We're

45:40.360 --> 45:46.760
talking about 20 fucking homemade Lunchables per Lunchable proper. That's a lot of margin.

45:46.760 --> 45:53.000
Has anyone ever bought a Lunchable thinking, I am, I'm a thrifty consumer. This is-

45:53.000 --> 45:59.720
Yeah, you're not, you are neither a thrifty, you're not fiscally smart. You are not making

45:59.720 --> 46:05.400
a good nutritional decision. You are basically just saying, I, I'm a piece of shit.

46:05.400 --> 46:08.600
Well, that's one of two things. Either you're saying like, I'm a piece of shit, or you're

46:08.600 --> 46:13.400
saying like, you know what, I'm going to little kid treat myself. Hey, eight year old Travis who

46:13.400 --> 46:18.040
only wanted Lunchables all the time, but his mom packed him like actual sandwiches and apples and

46:18.040 --> 46:21.720
stuff because she cared for him. But at the time he would look around the other kids who ate

46:21.720 --> 46:25.800
Lunchables and think what fun lives are they leaving? If only I was more of a Lunchables

46:25.800 --> 46:30.680
type kid, but I wasn't. So maybe 25 year old Travis buys eight year old Travis a Lunchable

46:30.680 --> 46:32.360
and sends it back to him through his tummy.

46:36.520 --> 46:37.400
We've got to go back.

46:38.840 --> 46:44.200
Can an adult not just enjoy a motherfucking Lunchable though without those auspices?

46:47.160 --> 46:50.040
You guys are throwing a lot of shade at Lunchables right now. I knew we,

46:50.040 --> 46:54.120
I knew we love horses on this podcast, but I did not know we love high horses quite so much.

46:55.480 --> 46:59.960
But are Lunchables not the same? Like I put them in the same category as, uh, the Hot Pocket.

47:00.840 --> 47:02.360
The Toaster Strudel.

47:02.360 --> 47:04.920
Yeah, that's a fucked up Venn diagram you just weaved.

47:04.920 --> 47:09.480
A Hot Pocket's a lot of work. You gotta push the buttons and, and a lot of fiddling.

47:10.360 --> 47:13.000
A Lunchable, you have to construct your own. They don't just hand you a package.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.760
That's customizable. Kids love that.

47:14.760 --> 47:20.280
Let's, um, we're getting away from the fucking heart of the matter. Um, and I want to get us

47:20.280 --> 47:24.040
back to it. And now, okay, if you want to fucking time travel, I'm eight years old.

47:24.040 --> 47:31.080
I roll up to school. I bust out a Gladware DIY. It's a, it's a Lunchaboo.

47:31.080 --> 47:34.440
You've written Lunchable on it, but you spelled it differently to avoid copyright.

47:34.440 --> 47:35.560
Griffin, what the fuck is that?

47:35.560 --> 47:37.880
It's, it's a, it's a Munchable.

47:37.880 --> 47:38.760
It's a what?

47:38.760 --> 47:44.200
A Munchable? Dad, my dad made it for me and he said it's just as good. And what do you-

47:44.200 --> 47:47.000
Stop it! I'm literally gonna cry. I'm literally gonna get too sad.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.200
What are you all eating?

47:48.200 --> 47:53.560
Uh, we're eating Lunchables that, uh, they're brand name Lunchables that our

47:53.560 --> 47:56.040
rich parents got us at the store. What was yours called?

47:56.040 --> 47:56.920
Munchables?

47:56.920 --> 47:57.960
What's in it?

47:57.960 --> 48:02.360
Um, looks like some, looks like I got some oyster crackers and a nice note.

48:04.600 --> 48:06.120
It seems, what seems to be a hair.

48:06.120 --> 48:07.480
Uh, it looks like a hair.

48:07.480 --> 48:10.840
I'm, this is one of my, this is one of my new dad Jerry's hairs.

48:10.840 --> 48:14.840
It seems the container smells like salami because it used to have salami in it.

48:15.720 --> 48:18.360
That's how we got it. We can't afford to buy Gladware either.

48:18.360 --> 48:20.520
We're just reusing the old containers.

48:20.520 --> 48:23.560
Can you, is this a, can I rock Munchables in the modern workplace?

48:23.560 --> 48:29.000
If I roll up and I have a fucking Gladware container and I've written Munchables on there

48:29.000 --> 48:34.200
in a Sharpie and maybe some of the letters are backwards, uh, just to like really drive it home

48:34.200 --> 48:38.840
and, uh, I'm just like Jerry from accounting walks in and he's like, what are you eating there?

48:38.840 --> 48:47.000
I say, oh, Munchables. Uh, and I, yeah, I prefer a fucking snack cracker tower.

48:47.000 --> 48:51.960
And I eat it from top down like a T-Rex. Uh, am I okay?

48:51.960 --> 48:52.520
Am I good?

48:52.520 --> 48:56.760
I think, I think, I think if you, if I got to watch you do that,

48:56.760 --> 49:00.360
just like a huge stack of crackers and cheese and meat, and then just deep

49:00.360 --> 49:03.560
throw it, just put your head at the top of it until it's all gone.

49:03.560 --> 49:07.640
Munchables, what these are Munchables. Yeah, I'll make you some. I'll bring some in tomorrow.

49:07.640 --> 49:11.640
The weird thing is, it's like a, the sadness is greater than the sum of its parts.

49:11.640 --> 49:15.240
Cause if you just brought in like a container with crackers,

49:15.240 --> 49:18.440
a separate container with cheese slices, a separate container.

49:18.440 --> 49:24.680
But that's not weird to me, but you put it all in the same container and transport it that way.

49:24.680 --> 49:27.000
And it's like a hundred percent sadder.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.560
Of course context is important in this situation.

49:29.560 --> 49:36.120
If I eat crackers and then in another room, I eat some lunch meat, it's not going to be a thing.

49:36.120 --> 49:42.200
But if I try to give it my own DIY fucking Pinterest branding, then we have a situation all right.

49:42.200 --> 49:44.760
This is an interesting question for you about Lunchables.

49:44.760 --> 49:51.960
If you go to a party, let's say where there are crackers and cheese and little pieces of meat,

49:51.960 --> 49:56.680
I don't think there's a number of those things that you would eat at which point you would say,

49:56.680 --> 50:01.880
well, I've had lunch now. Did you have lunch? Yes, I did.

50:01.880 --> 50:05.400
I grazed here and now I've had lunch.

50:05.400 --> 50:12.440
You guys are limiting your scope to the fucking snack cracker Lunchable box set.

50:12.440 --> 50:20.440
There was a lot more variety in there for our dirty North American Bento boxes,

50:20.440 --> 50:22.440
essentially is what we're talking about.

50:22.440 --> 50:28.200
I don't know if you guys ever sampled the pizza, which was pizza but cold.

50:28.200 --> 50:36.680
I have very clear memories of watching an adjacent rich kid eat the pizza Lunchable

50:36.680 --> 50:41.640
and being physically repulsed at the idea of eating all of it cold.

50:41.640 --> 50:44.680
And they would call it pizza and it turned my stomach even more.

50:44.680 --> 50:51.480
Let me take you down the Oubliette to even further just peer into the past.

50:51.480 --> 50:57.000
Just peer into the darkness with me and we'll talk about the definition of the word soft taco

50:58.280 --> 51:07.720
because Lunchables also had that that game wasn't especially on point because you had a round thing.

51:07.720 --> 51:08.360
It was the pizza crust.

51:08.360 --> 51:10.120
It was the fucking pizza crust.

51:10.120 --> 51:15.080
And then they had a cold, essentially giant ketchup packet.

51:15.080 --> 51:23.560
But instead of ketchup, it was ground meat question mark.

51:23.560 --> 51:27.720
I don't know how you would meet was a meat was in quotation marks.

51:27.720 --> 51:29.160
It was also an acronym.

51:30.680 --> 51:32.280
It was as bad news bears.

51:32.280 --> 51:36.520
I don't know how you would recreate that for the Munchables brand,

51:36.520 --> 51:38.360
but I think that there is a lot of opportunity in there.

51:38.360 --> 51:42.120
We could probably get some vegan free option vegan free gluten free.

51:42.120 --> 51:46.600
No vegan vegan I think all lunchables are inherently vegan free.

51:46.600 --> 51:48.520
Anyway, this person has a great point.

51:48.520 --> 51:49.640
I'm going to take this to Shark Tank.

51:49.640 --> 51:49.960
Thank you.

51:51.720 --> 51:52.760
Griffin hit me.

51:53.560 --> 51:55.720
This final Yahoo answer was sent in by me.

51:55.720 --> 51:56.040
Think about it.

51:56.040 --> 51:57.080
Drew Davenport.

51:57.080 --> 52:02.840
Yeah, it's in the arts and humanities section.

52:02.840 --> 52:06.280
It's asked by Moniz who asked who was John Candy?

52:06.280 --> 52:06.840
What did he do?

52:06.840 --> 52:07.800
Why is he important?

52:08.680 --> 52:10.200
My name is Justin McElroy.

52:10.200 --> 52:10.840
I'm Travis.

52:10.840 --> 52:11.880
I'm good for McElroy.

52:11.880 --> 52:13.480
This has been my brother, my brother, me.

52:13.480 --> 52:42.120
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

52:42.120 --> 52:53.480
It's better with you.
