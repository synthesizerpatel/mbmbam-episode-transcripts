00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.400
Hello, welcome to My Brother, my brother and mean advice show for the modern era.

00:48.400 --> 00:52.080
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.080 --> 00:57.600
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy, and this one's going right over the plate,

00:57.600 --> 01:00.960
right in it, right over the middle of the plate. Oh, like it's a perfect strike?

01:01.680 --> 01:05.360
This one's going to be a perfect strike. Well, no, because even that sounds like it

01:05.360 --> 01:11.680
takes a lot of effort. This one's going to be by the books, huh?

01:12.240 --> 01:14.080
Oh, okay. Second base.

01:14.640 --> 01:18.880
This one's going to get you to second base. This is a ground rule double. I don't know

01:18.880 --> 01:21.040
what that means. A lot of people are like,

01:21.040 --> 01:28.160
four, nine, nine. There must be ramping up and it's like, nah, we're not evil Knievel.

01:28.160 --> 01:34.560
You know what I mean? We don't need an approach game. This one's going to be right over the plate

01:34.560 --> 01:36.800
and then the next one's going to be fucking wild.

01:36.800 --> 01:39.200
We're walking this bat. This is the batter where-

01:39.200 --> 01:40.640
This batter is going to walk.

01:40.640 --> 01:45.280
We're going to walk this one because we know the next one's an easy out, but this one,

01:45.280 --> 01:50.160
oh, this is the big slugger who scares us because earlier in the season,

01:50.160 --> 01:54.080
he got that grand slam off of us to lose the big game and now we're a little nervous around him,

01:54.080 --> 01:58.480
so we might walk him. But what's that? Oh, Travis is coming in here and he's not ready to walk him.

01:58.480 --> 02:03.920
He's got blood in his eyes. He might kill this batter.

02:03.920 --> 02:08.880
I guarantee you will finish this episode of the podcast and say out loud, fine.

02:09.440 --> 02:09.760
Yeah.

02:12.160 --> 02:14.560
They recorded audio into microphones for an hour.

02:15.360 --> 02:19.360
Anybody can do that. I don't want it to say it's going to be bad.

02:19.360 --> 02:19.840
Okay.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.680
It's going to be fine.

02:21.680 --> 02:23.760
It's going to be an episode.

02:23.760 --> 02:27.440
Juice, it might be great, but I'll tell you this much.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.400
It's going to be a lot like the other episodes.

02:30.400 --> 02:30.640
Yeah.

02:31.200 --> 02:32.240
This one's going to get-

02:32.240 --> 02:36.400
This is the big unit that Travis's analogy was perfect.

02:37.200 --> 02:41.040
This episode's Mark McGuire. We're going to pass on him.

02:41.040 --> 02:43.920
We're going to let him go on to first so he doesn't do a lot of real damage

02:43.920 --> 02:49.200
before fucking Big Papi gets up here on 500 and slams one.

02:49.200 --> 02:53.120
This is the thing is like, no matter how well we did on this,

02:53.120 --> 02:56.080
this might end up being our greatest episode yet,

02:56.080 --> 03:00.080
but I think it would be rare to find somebody who would look at 500 episodes,

03:00.080 --> 03:02.480
like the 500th episode even, and say,

03:02.480 --> 03:05.840
oh yeah, but the most special one was 499.

03:05.840 --> 03:06.400
No, that's not-

03:06.400 --> 03:07.120
I just think that-

03:07.120 --> 03:07.600
That's weird.

03:08.240 --> 03:09.040
Here's what I'd say.

03:09.040 --> 03:10.000
Here's what I'd say, okay?

03:10.000 --> 03:10.640
Okay, yeah.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.880
498 perfect episodes, okay?

03:14.880 --> 03:15.440
Yeah.

03:15.440 --> 03:21.120
Certainly, certainly, dear listeners, I think you would agree, we've earned one.

03:21.120 --> 03:21.760
Right.

03:21.760 --> 03:22.560
For us.

03:22.560 --> 03:22.960
I can't believe-

03:22.960 --> 03:25.280
Not bad. Just for us.

03:25.280 --> 03:30.800
It's just- Go listen to episode 361.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.240
This one's going to be like that.

03:32.240 --> 03:34.560
I just assume it's not a live show or whatever the fuck.

03:34.560 --> 03:38.000
This one's going to be like episode 127, right?

03:38.000 --> 03:40.240
It's just going to be a fucking episode.

03:40.240 --> 03:43.840
Close your eyes and picture your platonic ideal of a my brother,

03:43.840 --> 03:45.040
my brother and me episode.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.320
This is going to be it.

03:46.960 --> 03:51.680
This is the Venn diagram of normal episodes, and this one is going to be one circle.

03:51.680 --> 03:53.760
We're going to do yahoos, we're going to have fun.

03:53.760 --> 03:58.400
But like, don't expect us to set some shit up.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.120
No.

03:59.120 --> 04:02.720
This is not the Rosetta Stone you need to understand episode 500.

04:02.720 --> 04:06.000
This one's Mark McGuire MLB former home run record holder.

04:06.000 --> 04:06.240
But now Griffin you ran-

04:06.240 --> 04:08.560
Don't lower your expectations either.

04:08.560 --> 04:08.960
No.

04:08.960 --> 04:10.080
No, it's going to be fine.

04:10.080 --> 04:10.880
It could be good.

04:10.880 --> 04:14.720
Griffin, you randomly pulled the 361, and I think that this episode,

04:14.720 --> 04:16.560
I would like to do this a few times.

04:16.560 --> 04:21.440
I'm going to just click out a random number generator and return to some great episodes.

04:21.440 --> 04:23.280
I don't want to play clips from them.

04:23.280 --> 04:23.760
Yeah.

04:23.760 --> 04:24.960
I just like this.

04:24.960 --> 04:29.120
So in 361, see if any of this.

04:29.120 --> 04:29.440
Okay.

04:29.440 --> 04:31.360
Hashtag Mambo number five.

04:31.360 --> 04:31.840
Nope.

04:31.840 --> 04:33.440
Nipple shrapnel.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.400
No.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.800
A frequency situation.

04:36.800 --> 04:37.600
No.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.440
Fondue rules.

04:39.440 --> 04:40.960
Fondue rules.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.840
That rings something of a bell.

04:44.720 --> 04:47.520
Navy Beans, Frials, and Nasier.

04:48.240 --> 04:49.360
It sounds like one of the-

04:49.360 --> 04:49.760
Oh wait.

04:49.760 --> 04:50.320
Okay.

04:50.320 --> 04:50.800
Frials and Nasier.

04:50.800 --> 04:53.200
That sounds like one we talked about Frasier in that one.

04:53.200 --> 04:53.600
Yeah.

04:53.600 --> 04:54.800
That's got to be, yeah.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.320
Hey, but we don't normally reminisce on this show.

04:58.320 --> 04:59.920
This one's got to be by the books, Jews.

04:59.920 --> 05:00.160
So.

05:01.040 --> 05:03.040
Well, no, I want it to be by the books.

05:03.040 --> 05:03.280
Yeah.

05:03.280 --> 05:05.280
We've never made a call back before, Griffin.

05:05.920 --> 05:06.560
Never successfully.

05:06.560 --> 05:07.120
No, no, no.

05:07.120 --> 05:11.200
We're not, see a call back implies that we're just recycling bits.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.080
Uh-huh.

05:12.080 --> 05:16.560
I want to just return to the randomly selected episode 141,

05:17.280 --> 05:19.120
Dan the man with the flan plan.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.000
Oh no, I know that one.

05:22.000 --> 05:22.800
Fun to say.

05:23.920 --> 05:29.680
February 2013, so young, favorite Oscars.

05:30.560 --> 05:31.680
Squatting.

05:31.680 --> 05:32.400
Okay.

05:32.400 --> 05:32.960
Eye butt.

05:32.960 --> 05:37.200
That sounds like a fruitful period.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.400
Big city living.

05:39.120 --> 05:39.600
Okay.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.800
Dansexual.

05:40.800 --> 05:41.840
Now that one I remember.

05:42.400 --> 05:45.120
How rich, what a rich tapestry we were weaving.

05:45.120 --> 05:46.080
What a rich time that was.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.280
Did you say, did you say eye butt?

05:48.960 --> 05:53.360
Was that lowercase I, big B butt, like it was from Apple?

05:53.360 --> 05:54.640
Lord almighty, that's good.

05:54.640 --> 05:57.760
An eye butt is one, is one that was in here.

05:57.760 --> 06:00.720
That's a very powerful, that's a powerful turn of phrase.

06:00.720 --> 06:05.280
What might be a fun game is what is the most recent episode

06:05.280 --> 06:08.160
that I can't remember a fucking lick of a thing about?

06:08.160 --> 06:11.360
Cause I bet it's pretty, I bet it's shockingly recent.

06:11.360 --> 06:11.680
Yeah.

06:12.400 --> 06:13.040
Yeah.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.400
466, just pulled that out of my butt.

06:17.040 --> 06:20.880
That would have been 23 episodes ago, right?

06:20.880 --> 06:23.520
We'll think of a journey back to 466, Griffin.

06:23.520 --> 06:25.120
That was the food train.

06:25.120 --> 06:26.240
Okay, I remember food train.

06:26.240 --> 06:26.560
Okay.

06:26.560 --> 06:27.040
Okay.

06:27.040 --> 06:27.760
We're good, we're good.

06:27.760 --> 06:28.400
So 466.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.080
Food train was smart actually.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.080
Food train was a smart, good idea.

06:32.080 --> 06:34.480
But let's go to 439.

06:34.480 --> 06:38.000
439, I bet you know it's a completely different

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
three boys hosted that show.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.680
Okay, 439.

06:41.680 --> 06:41.840
Yeah.

06:41.840 --> 06:44.480
Well that was, that was candle lights 2018.

06:44.480 --> 06:45.600
So you definitely do remember that.

06:45.600 --> 06:46.960
The memories are there, the memories.

06:46.960 --> 06:48.880
So then you probably stand with your arm like,

06:48.880 --> 06:51.680
oh, but this year's number blah, blah, blah.

06:51.680 --> 06:54.160
Which is an excuse for us not to do our usual jokes.

06:54.880 --> 06:57.680
437 to take it back to before that.

06:57.680 --> 06:58.720
A silent chug.

06:58.720 --> 07:00.080
Huh.

07:00.080 --> 07:03.200
That's business paintball, wishbone brutality,

07:03.840 --> 07:04.800
big candies.

07:05.360 --> 07:05.680
Oh.

07:06.880 --> 07:10.720
The fast food arms race, serious Zapdos,

07:11.680 --> 07:12.960
and horny radio Disney.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.120
Horny radio Disney, I remember.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.960
Okay, I got, I got, I got, I locked that in.

07:16.960 --> 07:18.720
Is this fun for anybody other than us?

07:18.720 --> 07:19.360
Probably not.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.440
It's barely fun for me.

07:21.440 --> 07:21.760
Yeah.

07:23.040 --> 07:24.880
I work for a food delivery service.

07:24.880 --> 07:25.760
Congratulations.

07:25.760 --> 07:28.320
We can all agree this is a classic start.

07:28.320 --> 07:28.880
Yeah.

07:28.880 --> 07:29.600
You know what I mean?

07:29.600 --> 07:30.640
This is right down the hump.

07:30.640 --> 07:32.640
And I tried to follow it up to you by doing the thing

07:32.640 --> 07:33.680
where I pretend like,

07:33.680 --> 07:36.000
even though I know Justin's reading the question,

07:36.000 --> 07:38.400
like it's that Justin is saying that thing about himself.

07:39.120 --> 07:39.600
Yeah.

07:39.600 --> 07:40.640
Classic, that's classic.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.240
Classic, classic.

07:42.240 --> 07:44.560
I'm gonna miss these bits in the new era.

07:44.560 --> 07:45.040
Yeah, right?

07:45.040 --> 07:50.480
Of five, in the light of 500 when things change so dramatically

07:50.480 --> 07:52.960
that it's scarcely recognizable as a podcast.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.560
That's when I'm gonna stop phoning it in.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.240
500 is our goop.

07:56.240 --> 07:57.200
This is what I'm saying.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.320
What, really?

07:58.320 --> 07:59.760
Listen, I wanna get back to this question for sure,

07:59.760 --> 08:00.960
for sure, for sure, for sure, for sure.

08:00.960 --> 08:01.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.040
Although I bet that when I started with,

08:03.040 --> 08:04.720
I work for a food delivery service,

08:04.720 --> 08:07.200
there were probably at least 75 people listening.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.960
They're like, yes, they did mine.

08:08.960 --> 08:09.760
All right, here we go.

08:09.760 --> 08:12.320
I thought you were gonna say 75% and I was going to agree.

08:12.320 --> 08:14.320
That number might also be accurate.

08:15.440 --> 08:19.920
I would, yeah, anyway, 500 is our goop.

08:19.920 --> 08:22.400
And what I'm saying is we're gonna transition

08:22.400 --> 08:25.360
from pure comedy to more lifestyle brand.

08:25.360 --> 08:26.560
I like that.

08:26.560 --> 08:29.280
That's where the money is, is a lifestyle brand.

08:29.280 --> 08:29.780
Yep.

08:30.800 --> 08:34.240
And then we can, I've got my new bit called Exfoliation Station.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.040
Yes, yeah.

08:35.040 --> 08:37.600
Everybody's been clamoring for me to have my own segment.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.480
So I'm gonna be talking about all kinds of crystalline rubs.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.200
I'm gonna be talking about peels.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.760
I'm going to be talking about acids.

08:45.760 --> 08:50.400
Abrasive, acidic, but your skin is either gonna look

08:50.400 --> 08:53.840
but your skin is either gonna look great or-

08:53.840 --> 08:54.880
Be gone.

08:54.880 --> 08:57.600
Be completely now your bones.

08:57.600 --> 08:59.360
And even that, maybe we can talk about that.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.840
Yeah, how to beautify your bones.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.920
Everyone's focused on such surface level stuff.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.840
I'm talking about like what's inside that counts,

09:05.840 --> 09:08.160
which is how pretty are your bones?

09:08.160 --> 09:10.160
Make those fucking sinews pop.

09:10.160 --> 09:12.480
Let's talk about the deep tissue.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.480
That in skin, but dazzling.

09:14.480 --> 09:17.040
I'm gonna do a new segment called What Not to Wear

09:17.040 --> 09:19.280
and it's W-H-E-R-E.

09:19.280 --> 09:23.040
And it's all about which vacation spots are out this season.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.080
Loving that.

09:24.080 --> 09:24.640
Thank you.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.240
I'm gonna do a segment called Toxic People in the Trash

09:30.240 --> 09:32.960
for me now and it's about relationships.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.040
Oh man.

09:35.760 --> 09:37.840
Are you in some way implying that that's Groven and I?

09:38.720 --> 09:39.680
No, no, no.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.320
Not in any way.

09:40.320 --> 09:42.640
You guys are bringing some incredible stuff.

09:42.640 --> 09:45.920
Exfoliation, the vacation stuff.

09:45.920 --> 09:46.400
I love it.

09:46.400 --> 09:47.680
What not to wear, please.

09:47.680 --> 09:49.760
Sometimes when I pick up food from a restaurant,

09:49.760 --> 09:50.720
I ask for a drink.

09:51.600 --> 09:52.000
Okay, wait.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.760
Let's run it back to the beginning of the question.

09:55.440 --> 09:56.400
I work for it.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.320
Okay, but that is actually applicable to me.

10:01.520 --> 10:03.040
Sometimes when I pick up food from a restaurant,

10:03.040 --> 10:03.760
I ask for a drink.

10:03.760 --> 10:05.920
About half the time, they just give me a drink.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.760
But sometimes they ask for payment

10:08.400 --> 10:10.480
and then I'm forced to pay for the drink

10:10.480 --> 10:12.240
because I'm not gonna tell them I don't want it now.

10:12.880 --> 10:13.440
That's true.

10:13.440 --> 10:16.080
They already fucking got you right where they want you.

10:16.080 --> 10:16.960
Thirsty.

10:16.960 --> 10:19.600
Brothers, how can I get a free drink from these restaurants

10:19.600 --> 10:21.680
or decline the drink after the fact?

10:21.680 --> 10:23.760
And that's from no such thing as a free drink.

10:23.760 --> 10:24.320
You can't.

10:24.320 --> 10:28.000
This is so fucking wild.

10:28.560 --> 10:32.800
This is such a wild like fast food hacks

10:32.800 --> 10:36.480
keep an empty cup from every fast food restaurant in your car

10:36.480 --> 10:40.240
so you go in for free refills level of you asking us

10:40.240 --> 10:43.040
how to fucking cheat the Burger King.

10:43.040 --> 10:46.240
How to personally cheat and bamboozle the Burger Man.

10:46.240 --> 10:47.760
Okay, counterpoint though.

10:47.760 --> 10:48.400
I get it.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.840
Cause like you are thinking like,

10:49.840 --> 10:51.760
oh, long day, huh?

10:51.760 --> 10:53.920
We're both in the food service industry.

10:53.920 --> 10:54.560
Woo.

10:54.560 --> 10:54.800
Yeah.

10:54.800 --> 10:58.240
Just picking up another order for those bags of bones

10:58.240 --> 10:59.360
who can't come in and get it.

10:59.360 --> 11:00.080
Am I right?

11:00.080 --> 11:02.000
Anyways, I'd love a Mr. Pibbs.

11:02.720 --> 11:06.160
But if that's the sort of spectrum we're going off of,

11:06.160 --> 11:08.000
when I worked at TCBY,

11:08.000 --> 11:11.280
I never walked into the Baskin Robbins down the street

11:11.280 --> 11:13.680
and said like, oof, ice cream days.

11:13.680 --> 11:14.720
Tell me about it.

11:14.720 --> 11:15.920
These hot times.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.360
Oh, when the hot times are here,

11:17.360 --> 11:19.680
ice cream days get rough, right fam?

11:19.680 --> 11:22.560
Anyways, Sprite for free please.

11:23.360 --> 11:25.440
But what have you had and it worked?

11:25.440 --> 11:27.600
That's what I'm saying is this question asker,

11:27.600 --> 11:31.360
there's already some proven proof in the pudding here

11:31.360 --> 11:33.280
that they have received free drink.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.600
They're not asking, can I go do this?

11:35.600 --> 11:38.400
Half the time this works, right?

11:38.400 --> 11:40.560
So here's what I would do.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.000
Here's what I would do.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.520
When the person, when you're like,

11:43.520 --> 11:45.120
oh, can I grab a drink while I'm here?

11:45.120 --> 11:47.360
And they're like, yeah, for money.

11:47.360 --> 11:50.000
You say, oh, no moneys.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.840
And pull your pockets out and they're empty.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.600
And if you can, have a moth in there.

11:53.600 --> 11:54.480
Moth in there, that's good.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.880
That will sell them like, oh, no moneys.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.880
And then you might still get the free drink,

11:58.880 --> 12:00.080
but at the very least it's like,

12:01.680 --> 12:04.640
I delivered for let's say a sandwich chain

12:04.640 --> 12:06.080
known for their rapid deliveries.

12:06.640 --> 12:09.920
And a lot of the times people would tip me cash

12:09.920 --> 12:12.560
and I was so thankful because I needed that money

12:12.560 --> 12:15.840
to put gasoline into my car to get back to the sandwich chain

12:15.840 --> 12:16.480
that I worked at.

12:17.360 --> 12:20.320
And so it's not that far off if someone was like,

12:20.320 --> 12:22.960
it's gonna be 2.99 for this large soda or whatever.

12:22.960 --> 12:24.320
And I was like, no moneys.

12:25.040 --> 12:27.120
I'm probably not lying at that point in my life.

12:27.120 --> 12:28.800
And you did have that trained moth

12:29.360 --> 12:31.040
that you used for this exact scenario.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.880
Well, the moth would wet its beak too.

12:32.880 --> 12:33.360
You know what I mean?

12:33.360 --> 12:35.040
It would get a little Mr. Pippen there as well.

12:38.400 --> 12:39.280
Here's what I would try.

12:39.280 --> 12:42.080
Hey, I'm really, hey, I hate to bother you.

12:42.080 --> 12:42.640
Thanks for the food.

12:42.640 --> 12:44.000
I'm really, really thirsty.

12:45.120 --> 12:46.080
Do you mind if I get a drink?

12:47.040 --> 12:50.160
And they're like, that'll be a dollar.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.920
And you look at them dead in the eye and say,

12:51.920 --> 12:54.720
I just meant from the sink in the bathroom.

12:54.720 --> 12:56.240
I was just gonna get one.

12:56.240 --> 12:58.960
I was gonna make my hands into a cup

12:58.960 --> 13:01.200
and then drink from the sink in your bathroom.

13:01.200 --> 13:04.880
I was just gonna lap up that muddy, dirty puddle outside.

13:04.880 --> 13:05.520
Sorry.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.200
Wow, I didn't know.

13:07.200 --> 13:11.520
I just meant the puddle water and then they'll feel so bad

13:11.520 --> 13:13.440
that they'll maybe just comp you.

13:13.440 --> 13:14.880
Okay, just don't do that on my way.

13:14.880 --> 13:18.400
Have a cold, refreshing nickels worth of syrup and cardboard

13:19.360 --> 13:21.760
and enjoy this soda.

13:22.320 --> 13:24.000
Ooh, what about this undercutting?

13:24.880 --> 13:26.720
Okay, that'll be a buck 50.

13:26.720 --> 13:27.920
You're like, okay, how about this?

13:28.800 --> 13:29.920
How about I give you a dollar

13:29.920 --> 13:31.440
and we both shut the fuck up about it?

13:32.320 --> 13:33.600
That's like a discount.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.040
Okay, you're right.

13:35.040 --> 13:38.400
Right, that's even worse now that I'm saying it out loud maybe.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.240
Yeah, higher chance of getting fired.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.240
That's kind of Sprite embezzlement

13:42.240 --> 13:44.640
if you think about it.

13:44.640 --> 13:48.960
You could just turn around and resell it to another customer.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.400
Be like, oh shit, really?

13:50.400 --> 13:51.680
Okay, hold on, wait.

13:51.680 --> 13:53.120
Anybody want a Sprite?

13:53.600 --> 13:55.040
Normal price.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.400
I did taste it.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.520
So you know it's good.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.160
Why did I just say like,

14:00.160 --> 14:02.000
oh, I was hoping for an employee discount

14:02.000 --> 14:02.800
and they're like, what?

14:02.800 --> 14:05.120
I'm like, I deliver food for you.

14:05.120 --> 14:06.160
I'm an employee.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.720
And then if they're like, no, you're not.

14:08.720 --> 14:09.600
I was like, okay.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.680
And then you take the food and you deliver it somewhere else

14:11.680 --> 14:13.520
and you never talk to that person again.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.880
Yeah, sorry, I got confused.

14:15.600 --> 14:16.880
I thought I worked here

14:16.880 --> 14:19.440
because I'm here picking up food that I'm not going to eat

14:19.440 --> 14:21.680
and I'm taking it to someone else who is going to eat it

14:21.680 --> 14:22.720
and they pay me.

14:22.720 --> 14:25.360
I am here more often than you are.

14:26.560 --> 14:27.920
Do you know who I am?

14:27.920 --> 14:30.000
Do you know who the fuck I am?

14:30.000 --> 14:33.200
Do you know who the fuck I am?

14:33.200 --> 14:35.040
They say, you have to pay for your drink.

14:35.040 --> 14:38.400
Just take the bag of food and up into the floor.

14:38.400 --> 14:39.120
I quit.

14:40.560 --> 14:42.880
Take this job and shove your job.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.760
Please don't call my boss, which I think is you.

14:48.560 --> 14:49.600
Or the app.

14:49.600 --> 14:50.720
Can you call an app?

14:51.360 --> 14:53.760
It would be, if they say, try to charge you,

14:54.400 --> 14:57.120
just pull a sandwich bag out of your pocket

14:57.120 --> 14:59.520
and say, I don't actually need a cup.

14:59.520 --> 15:01.040
I don't know if you have a cheaper rate

15:01.040 --> 15:04.000
if you just fill up this soda bag for me

15:04.000 --> 15:05.200
and then I'll be on my way.

15:05.200 --> 15:06.480
Put a soda bag.

15:06.480 --> 15:07.760
Just fill up this soda bag.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.560
I have a Yahoo here.

15:10.560 --> 15:12.960
This one was sent in by Daisy.

15:12.960 --> 15:13.600
Thank you, Daisy.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.760
It's a Yahoo Answers user, Anthony J.

15:17.120 --> 15:20.800
Who asks, you know such flavors?

15:22.160 --> 15:22.960
Huh?

15:22.960 --> 15:25.760
You know such flavors as chocolate cake

15:25.760 --> 15:29.200
and marble vanilla, strawberry, lemon and such.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.160
Right?

15:30.160 --> 15:30.640
Yeah.

15:30.640 --> 15:32.080
Like cake flavors.

15:32.080 --> 15:32.560
Cake flavor.

15:32.560 --> 15:33.760
I know such flavors.

15:33.760 --> 15:34.000
Okay.

15:34.720 --> 15:37.680
Would anybody be interested in a grape flavored cake?

15:38.560 --> 15:41.040
And I, boys, the last thing I want to do

15:41.040 --> 15:43.040
is relitigate hot grapes, right?

15:43.040 --> 15:45.360
That is the last sort of predicament I want to get into.

15:45.360 --> 15:46.640
Griffin, can I say something?

15:46.640 --> 15:46.880
Yeah.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.720
Didn't cross my mind till you said it.

15:48.720 --> 15:49.040
Okay.

15:49.040 --> 15:53.520
Well, maybe my bit recall is actually better

15:53.520 --> 15:55.120
than I'm giving myself credit for.

15:55.120 --> 15:58.560
But let's talk about this.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.200
Where's the grapes cakes?

16:01.920 --> 16:04.080
Well, here's the thing, Ditto.

16:04.080 --> 16:04.800
Yeah.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.960
Is that there's two different grape flavors,

16:06.960 --> 16:11.280
as is true with a lot of fruit flavors, I would say.

16:11.280 --> 16:14.080
We have the grapes that one might eat off a vine

16:14.080 --> 16:16.080
and then we have the grape flavor that one might get

16:16.080 --> 16:19.200
and say a pouch of Big League Chew, right?

16:19.200 --> 16:20.720
That doesn't taste like that.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.320
They don't taste like each other.

16:22.320 --> 16:23.120
It's purple.

16:23.120 --> 16:23.600
It's purple.

16:23.600 --> 16:24.400
It's a different flavor.

16:24.400 --> 16:24.960
It's purple.

16:24.960 --> 16:25.600
It's purple flavor.

16:25.600 --> 16:29.840
Yeah, but if you taste that weird Big League Chew grape,

16:29.840 --> 16:31.040
you're like, that's grape.

16:31.040 --> 16:32.080
I know what this tastes like.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.280
And you'll eat a grape and you'll be like,

16:33.280 --> 16:34.880
this tastes like grapes, right?

16:34.880 --> 16:36.480
But the twang do not meet.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.600
There's really not a good middle ground

16:39.600 --> 16:41.200
of both grapes, is there?

16:41.200 --> 16:41.920
No.

16:41.920 --> 16:45.200
And if you made a flavor that tasted like grape grapes,

16:46.000 --> 16:47.360
it would be weird as fuck.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.680
It would be really good though, right?

16:49.680 --> 16:50.320
It would be good.

16:50.320 --> 16:51.600
Grapes is good though, actually.

16:51.600 --> 16:52.800
Travis, I'm coming back around.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.080
I'm not saying it would be bad.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.200
Didn't say it'd be bad.

16:55.200 --> 16:56.320
Said it'd be weird.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.640
But they're not making cakes of this stuff.

16:58.640 --> 16:59.200
Yeah.

16:59.200 --> 17:04.000
They're making cakes of virtually every other flavor, right?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.800
I've had so many, I've had more lemon cakes

17:06.800 --> 17:09.280
than you could shake a freaking stick at.

17:09.280 --> 17:09.680
I don't know.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.680
I could shake a stick at a lot of cakes.

17:11.680 --> 17:13.920
And I've seen a lot of shows where they make,

17:13.920 --> 17:15.680
they're making stuff like this.

17:15.680 --> 17:16.560
Oh yeah.

17:16.560 --> 17:17.600
They make weird shit.

17:17.600 --> 17:18.080
I watched it.

17:18.080 --> 17:19.440
I've seen it on the Nailed It,

17:19.440 --> 17:21.200
on the Great British Bake Off,

17:21.200 --> 17:22.800
on the Zumbos.

17:22.800 --> 17:25.680
Where's my Grape British Break Off?

17:25.680 --> 17:27.120
My Grape British Break Off.

17:27.760 --> 17:29.120
Let me, fuck.

17:29.120 --> 17:32.160
My Grape British Bake Off.

17:32.160 --> 17:32.720
Where is it?

17:34.880 --> 17:35.920
I want to take a second.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.520
I went ahead and Googled it.

17:37.520 --> 17:38.800
Grape cake, right?

17:38.800 --> 17:40.320
I Googled grape cake.

17:40.320 --> 17:45.040
And the first result is a Food Network offering

17:45.040 --> 17:48.320
from chopped judge Alex Guarnaschelli.

17:48.320 --> 17:48.640
Yeah.

17:48.640 --> 17:50.880
And here's what she has called this.

17:50.880 --> 17:53.440
It is warm grape cake.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.160
Okay.

17:54.160 --> 17:58.720
And Alex, that's, don't tell me the temperature

17:58.720 --> 18:01.040
at which this cake will arrive to my guests.

18:01.040 --> 18:03.440
Because I would say you probably have a,

18:03.440 --> 18:07.120
at best, 10 minute window of warm, right?

18:07.120 --> 18:10.400
Before you hurdle past out of hot into cold.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.320
Now it just challenges us.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.320
Why does she say, Alex knows this.

18:14.320 --> 18:15.520
She's a foodie.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.760
Why would she call it warm grape cake?

18:17.760 --> 18:19.520
And I think it's because Alex,

18:19.520 --> 18:21.920
Alex read the words grape cake

18:21.920 --> 18:24.000
at the top of her paper guitar band

18:24.000 --> 18:26.880
and thought, that looks fucking crazy.

18:26.880 --> 18:29.040
I can't call it grape cake.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.000
That's insane.

18:30.560 --> 18:32.160
Absolutely can't do that.

18:32.160 --> 18:34.960
It's also entirely possible that Alex included,

18:34.960 --> 18:37.040
well, at some point in the recipe.

18:37.040 --> 18:39.520
So at some point you're going to have to cook these grapes.

18:39.520 --> 18:41.600
And then she was like, I got to warn people

18:41.600 --> 18:43.360
about what they're getting into before.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.280
This is a sin against God.

18:45.280 --> 18:46.320
I got to give them a heads up

18:46.320 --> 18:48.640
before they start mixing flour and what have you.

18:48.640 --> 18:50.160
Yeah, okay.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.520
Here's what I think it is, boys.

18:51.520 --> 18:52.880
Here's what I think it is.

18:52.880 --> 18:54.400
Wait, wait, hold on.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.600
I want to say something else.

18:56.160 --> 19:00.480
The second recipe is from Once Upon a Chef

19:00.480 --> 19:03.280
and it is called Harvest Grape Cake.

19:03.280 --> 19:04.000
Fuck off.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.360
They need something in there, huh?

19:05.360 --> 19:07.120
Just, you got to get something in there

19:07.120 --> 19:08.320
because it's just, okay.

19:08.320 --> 19:11.120
Martha Stewart is the third result

19:11.120 --> 19:14.400
and hers is called a Winemaker's Grape Cake.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.560
Just have some strength in your-

19:16.560 --> 19:18.640
Let it stand on its own merits.

19:18.640 --> 19:21.200
Okay, to be fair, Justin, right?

19:21.200 --> 19:22.160
Someone walks up to you

19:22.160 --> 19:24.320
and they're somehow balancing three trays, right?

19:24.320 --> 19:26.640
And they say, this is a chocolate cake.

19:26.640 --> 19:28.800
And you think, ah, I know what that is.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.400
This is a strawberry cake.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.000
Yes, yes, I understand.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.600
And this is a grape cake.

19:34.400 --> 19:37.120
It's the next result after that is from Kitchen

19:37.120 --> 19:38.800
and it's called Fresh Grape Cake.

19:41.440 --> 19:45.440
Just, I'm having to go to the second page of Google now

19:45.440 --> 19:48.560
to see if there's somebody who had the power

19:48.560 --> 19:51.120
to just stand in their fucking truth.

19:51.920 --> 19:55.280
Okay, fine dining lovers, soft white grape cake.

19:55.280 --> 19:57.040
So the cake is soft and white.

19:57.040 --> 20:00.400
It's weird how not every other fucking cake recipe

20:00.400 --> 20:02.080
has to say it's soft.

20:02.080 --> 20:03.440
Yeah, that's not a thing.

20:03.440 --> 20:04.720
Hey, how was the cake?

20:04.720 --> 20:08.320
Soft, warm, harvest, winemakers.

20:09.600 --> 20:12.720
Rock Recipes has a sunken grape almond cake.

20:12.720 --> 20:13.200
Oh boy.

20:13.200 --> 20:15.520
Come on, that sounds bad.

20:15.520 --> 20:16.800
That sounds haunted.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.720
Here's, okay, picture this, right?

20:18.720 --> 20:19.840
The cakes I described earlier.

20:19.840 --> 20:21.920
I hand you a strawberry cake, you cut into it.

20:21.920 --> 20:23.040
What color is it?

20:23.040 --> 20:23.840
Pink.

20:23.840 --> 20:26.160
Okay, I hand you a lemon cake, you cut into it.

20:26.160 --> 20:27.360
What color is it?

20:27.360 --> 20:28.240
Yellow.

20:28.240 --> 20:31.440
I hand you a grape cake, you cut into it.

20:31.440 --> 20:32.240
Is it purple?

20:33.360 --> 20:37.280
But grapes aren't necessarily, oh shit, Trav.

20:37.280 --> 20:39.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:39.200 --> 20:43.440
Yeah, you better be prepared to stand next to your cake

20:43.440 --> 20:45.360
for each person that comes up and they're like,

20:45.360 --> 20:46.240
what's this?

20:46.240 --> 20:48.560
And you have to tell them, it's a grape cake.

20:48.560 --> 20:51.280
I know it's not purple, but it's not a purple cake.

20:51.280 --> 20:52.400
It's not purple flavored.

20:52.400 --> 20:53.840
It's not purple, it's great.

20:53.840 --> 20:54.880
This is a grape cake.

20:54.880 --> 20:56.320
Yeah, but shouldn't the bread be purple?

20:56.320 --> 20:59.280
No, grapes don't dye things purple.

20:59.280 --> 21:02.480
Like, cut open a grape, rub it on something.

21:02.480 --> 21:03.920
It doesn't make it purple.

21:03.920 --> 21:06.080
It's kind of clear on the inside, isn't it, Paul?

21:06.080 --> 21:06.580
Yeah.

21:06.580 --> 21:10.020
Coming over here talking smart about my grape cake.

21:10.020 --> 21:12.500
I don't think this flavor's gonna be good in your cake.

21:12.500 --> 21:14.660
Well, Paul Hollywood, have you ever had a fucking grape cake?

21:15.620 --> 21:19.300
No, actually, why are we making cakes out of these little guys?

21:19.300 --> 21:19.800
You win.

21:21.380 --> 21:22.900
These little nature's gushers.

21:22.900 --> 21:23.940
I love these things.

21:23.940 --> 21:24.820
I love these guys.

21:24.820 --> 21:25.860
I eat them all the time.

21:26.660 --> 21:27.140
You're right.

21:27.700 --> 21:29.780
I've never even made a cake with these guys.

21:29.780 --> 21:30.980
And I make lots of cakes.

21:32.180 --> 21:32.980
This is weird.

21:32.980 --> 21:35.780
But then imagine Paul Hollywood gets on TV and they're like,

21:35.780 --> 21:37.060
so Paul, what do you make you for us?

21:37.060 --> 21:38.500
And he has to say, grape cake.

21:39.220 --> 21:41.060
Paul's grape cake.

21:43.060 --> 21:44.340
So it's just grape cake, Paul?

21:44.980 --> 21:54.820
I mean, it's a Paul's fresh harvest cake featuring also grapes.

21:54.820 --> 21:57.380
I bet that there was in history at least once that someone said

21:57.380 --> 21:59.780
grape cake and they said, did you say great cake?

21:59.780 --> 22:00.420
I hope so.

22:00.420 --> 22:01.620
I was like, no, grape cake?

22:01.620 --> 22:02.260
Oh, thank you.

22:02.260 --> 22:05.300
I just bought it at the cape store.

22:05.300 --> 22:06.980
No, I didn't say great cape.

22:06.980 --> 22:07.220
What?

22:11.220 --> 22:12.740
Just call it Paul's grape cake.

22:13.300 --> 22:16.580
Just call it Paul's finest grape cake on the market today.

22:17.380 --> 22:20.660
I work at a hardware store, specifically in the paint department.

22:20.660 --> 22:23.620
I worked here for four years and I am a seasoned veteran.

22:23.620 --> 22:25.860
So I know my way around the color spectrum.

22:25.860 --> 22:29.060
I can make over 30,000 different colors.

22:29.060 --> 22:29.560
Jesus.

22:30.260 --> 22:31.780
Yeah, I mean, come on.

22:31.780 --> 22:33.460
How many colors do you two think you can make?

22:33.460 --> 22:35.940
How many can I make or how many can I name?

22:35.940 --> 22:36.660
Wait, can I finish?

22:36.660 --> 22:37.860
Yeah, can I finish?

22:39.620 --> 22:40.420
Can I finish?

22:40.420 --> 22:40.740
Right.

22:40.740 --> 22:41.300
Who is that?

22:41.300 --> 22:41.780
Who is that?

22:41.780 --> 22:43.140
Is that fucking Ross Perot?

22:43.140 --> 22:44.500
That is funny.

22:44.500 --> 22:45.620
Fuck, that's funny.

22:45.620 --> 22:46.660
Fuck, that's funny.

22:47.940 --> 22:50.820
But today a customer asked me a question I've never heard before.

22:51.860 --> 22:52.900
Which color is best?

22:54.420 --> 22:57.380
Well, brothers, what is the best color?

22:57.380 --> 23:03.860
And that's Trent from, okay, Cupid, Oklahoma City.

23:03.860 --> 23:04.340
Yeah.

23:04.340 --> 23:04.980
Okay.

23:04.980 --> 23:06.660
Did you get, oh, you got a little confused.

23:06.660 --> 23:07.460
It's okay say.

23:07.460 --> 23:07.700
Yeah.

23:07.700 --> 23:08.340
It's okay say.

23:08.340 --> 23:09.140
Oh, I know, I know.

23:09.140 --> 23:13.060
Yeah, your brain got scared and confused of the truth.

23:14.420 --> 23:14.920
Blue.

23:16.020 --> 23:16.520
Blue?

23:17.220 --> 23:18.420
No, blue is a sad color.

23:18.420 --> 23:18.920
Green.

23:20.820 --> 23:21.320
Okay.

23:22.580 --> 23:25.540
If we sit here and talk about our favorite colors.

23:25.540 --> 23:26.500
Not our favorite best.

23:26.500 --> 23:29.140
Okay, but I'm talking about what we're currently doing,

23:29.140 --> 23:30.900
which is talking about our favorite colors.

23:31.540 --> 23:34.340
It's not going to be fun or entertaining.

23:34.340 --> 23:39.140
The bias has already, like we've been at this for 0.0 seconds

23:39.620 --> 23:44.580
and the bias has already fucking crept in and polluted the game.

23:44.580 --> 23:48.660
So let's take a step back and we'll take blue and green off the table for a minute

23:48.660 --> 23:50.900
until we can talk about it like scientists and adults.

23:50.900 --> 23:53.460
Okay, I will be a scientist then and I'll tell you.

23:53.460 --> 23:58.420
The answer is, unfortunately, in the context with which I imagine this question is being asked,

23:58.420 --> 24:04.980
which is like paint for either the inside or outside of a home or office or business of some sort.

24:04.980 --> 24:08.180
The answer is like eggshell or off-white or something, right?

24:08.180 --> 24:08.680
Yeah.

24:08.680 --> 24:11.620
Because then it's like, hey, we're not going to make a choice with this color,

24:11.620 --> 24:13.140
but it's not going to be white either.

24:13.140 --> 24:15.140
Oh, we're not going with white.

24:15.140 --> 24:16.500
This is going to have a little life to it.

24:16.500 --> 24:17.460
Well, you are, right?

24:17.460 --> 24:19.700
You are though, right?

24:19.700 --> 24:20.260
What do you mean?

24:20.260 --> 24:23.780
You're saying, I just wanted to clarify that you're saying white's the best color.

24:23.780 --> 24:26.660
I'm not saying white, I'm saying off-white or eggshell.

24:26.660 --> 24:28.900
So, yeah, but those are white.

24:28.900 --> 24:35.140
So you're saying like the best Travis McElroy podcast says white is best.

24:35.140 --> 24:39.940
I said in the context of paint for a room inside or outside.

24:39.940 --> 24:41.700
I don't have room for that in my tweet.

24:41.700 --> 24:43.940
Listen, I love all this stuff.

24:43.940 --> 24:47.140
I think that's really going to help with the TMZ article and everything.

24:47.140 --> 24:48.740
But what about pale gray?

24:48.740 --> 24:49.300
How's that?

24:49.300 --> 24:50.580
We're getting close.

24:50.580 --> 24:53.620
All right, I'm going to take it in a different direction.

24:53.620 --> 24:57.780
With red, you can scare a bull.

24:57.780 --> 24:59.220
Yeah, but-

24:59.220 --> 25:01.540
But a bull's charging.

25:01.540 --> 25:06.500
Okay, Travis, let's play in the fucking space for like a minute, scientifically, okay?

25:06.500 --> 25:08.820
Let's hypothesize in the space.

25:08.820 --> 25:10.740
Bull is charging at you.

25:10.740 --> 25:13.300
What color do you want your little handy towel to be?

25:13.300 --> 25:18.100
I mean, red, but I don't think the customer's asking, what color should I paint?

25:18.100 --> 25:21.780
I'm asking, what color should I buy to paint my handy towel, Griffin?

25:21.780 --> 25:25.860
The color, Griffin has said the bull is scared of red.

25:25.860 --> 25:32.500
So is the way the bull fighting works is the scene is red and the bull has to be like,

25:32.500 --> 25:35.860
that's really fucking scary, but I'm not going to be cowed by this.

25:35.860 --> 25:40.100
I want to show that he's the boss, even though I'm fucking terrified of this town.

25:40.100 --> 25:40.740
No, yeah.

25:40.740 --> 25:45.220
You know, red was the color that every bull's gym coach wore is the thing.

25:45.220 --> 25:48.980
And so the bull's like, I will not be bullied, that's where the term comes from,

25:48.980 --> 25:50.260
by the color red again.

25:51.620 --> 25:56.020
Yeah, so I'm trying to think of like practicality, right?

25:56.020 --> 25:58.580
Yes, I think, what about this?

25:58.580 --> 25:59.380
Camouflage.

26:00.500 --> 26:02.660
That's a few colors though, isn't it, Travis?

26:02.660 --> 26:09.060
Well, you say that, but I see those videos on Facebook where people like dip a helmet.

26:09.060 --> 26:10.820
They don't dick a helmet, that'd be weird.

26:10.820 --> 26:14.500
They dip a helmet into water that has that camouflage paint sitting on top of it.

26:14.500 --> 26:18.660
Those are, dude, and those videos are badass, like we can all agree on that,

26:18.660 --> 26:20.020
but it's so far from being a-

26:20.020 --> 26:23.860
The way they, that and the ones where people dig out like a pool in a house and stuff.

26:23.860 --> 26:25.540
And they just like live there?

26:25.540 --> 26:29.620
Whoa, I can watch that with the sound off for days.

26:29.620 --> 26:33.940
What about the ones where they make cakes, but they're like clear jello cakes?

26:33.940 --> 26:38.500
Oh yes, the ones where they slowly make stuff out of like colored pencils and,

26:38.500 --> 26:42.900
you know, it's like, oh look, I'm going to recreate like a thing to sharpen pencils

26:42.900 --> 26:44.820
and I'm going to do it in like a thousand steps.

26:44.820 --> 26:46.500
I fucking love that, dude.

26:47.220 --> 26:48.180
That's a good color.

26:48.740 --> 26:52.900
I think so far, if we're doing it with an unbiased stance,

26:54.580 --> 27:02.340
my Red Scares the Bull argument is still sort of in the lead because it's the one,

27:02.340 --> 27:06.900
it's the only color you're going to want if a bull's coming to get you.

27:06.900 --> 27:08.180
Okay, okay.

27:08.180 --> 27:13.700
So unless anybody has something that can beat the Red Scares the Bull.

27:13.700 --> 27:14.900
The Red Scares the Bull.

27:18.660 --> 27:20.740
What's a color that bees don't like?

27:20.740 --> 27:22.500
I was just thinking about bees, Travis.

27:22.500 --> 27:23.940
Yeah, you were thinking about bees?

27:23.940 --> 27:26.660
But I don't think they give a fuck about color, do they?

27:26.660 --> 27:28.900
Well, what if you painted your whole house to look like a big bee?

27:30.420 --> 27:32.340
That's multiple colors.

27:32.340 --> 27:33.140
I don't think if you paint-

27:33.140 --> 27:34.260
It's two colors, it's two.

27:34.260 --> 27:34.900
Yeah.

27:34.900 --> 27:37.220
Do you know that bees can see colors we can't?

27:37.220 --> 27:37.860
Yeah.

27:37.860 --> 27:41.220
Oh, so it's probably, the answer is probably whatever color that bee is seeing.

27:41.220 --> 27:46.420
Bees can see UV fucking tripping 24 hours a day.

27:46.420 --> 27:49.060
That makes me mad that there's a color I can't see.

27:49.060 --> 27:49.780
Okay, thank you.

27:49.780 --> 27:50.660
I'm glad they're gone.

27:52.580 --> 27:54.820
Well, when you look at the color spectrum, right?

27:54.820 --> 27:55.780
And let's put it on here.

27:55.780 --> 27:58.820
Let's do, sometimes boys, I like to be a little bit nerdy.

27:59.380 --> 28:01.060
And I like to really geek it up.

28:01.060 --> 28:08.100
It's like just past like indigo, purple, ultraviolet, right?

28:08.100 --> 28:12.900
So like, I just imagine it keeps going and then it's like ultra ultraviolet.

28:12.900 --> 28:16.260
It gets purpler and purpler and purpler.

28:16.260 --> 28:19.460
So like bees, they see all the cool colors that we can see,

28:19.460 --> 28:23.060
but they can see the dankest fucking purples that are so purple,

28:23.060 --> 28:26.100
like our brains can't even think about it.

28:26.100 --> 28:32.100
And what if, hey, you guys, what if one day all the bees looked up

28:32.100 --> 28:35.540
and God had written in like ultraviolet in the middle of the air,

28:35.540 --> 28:38.340
everything's fucked, you guys need to get out of here.

28:38.340 --> 28:41.460
But we couldn't see it and the bees did.

28:41.460 --> 28:42.980
And they're like, oh, we better go.

28:44.260 --> 28:46.420
Can I talk more about bees for one second?

28:46.420 --> 28:47.700
Yeah, I'd love that.

28:48.580 --> 28:51.780
Bees cannot distinguish red from black.

28:51.780 --> 28:56.660
So I think if bees could talk, the first thing bees would say is,

28:57.700 --> 29:00.020
you have got to explain checkers to me.

29:00.020 --> 29:01.700
What the fuck are you guys doing?

29:02.820 --> 29:08.260
Come on, you're just moving these tiny plates?

29:08.260 --> 29:10.980
I don't know, y'all, but it is wild.

29:10.980 --> 29:13.780
That's why we left, because y'all are doing checkers so much.

29:13.780 --> 29:15.940
We're like, this is fucking nothing.

29:16.580 --> 29:20.740
Okay, so just to clarify, bees can see colors that we can't,

29:20.740 --> 29:23.940
but they also can't see colors that we can?

29:25.140 --> 29:26.820
Yeah, baby, it's a trade-off.

29:26.820 --> 29:27.780
I hate that.

29:27.780 --> 29:29.620
That's why we're so different, huh?

29:29.620 --> 29:33.940
It takes all kinds, it takes a whole village to pollinate a flower.

29:33.940 --> 29:36.580
Everyone should have a bee paired with them.

29:36.580 --> 29:39.700
The bee will tell us about all the ultraviolet stuff we can't see.

29:39.700 --> 29:41.940
And we can be like, hey, let me explain to you

29:42.740 --> 29:45.140
why this can of Mountain Dew Red looks so cool.

29:46.660 --> 29:48.260
I'm gonna make a point about bees, all right?

29:48.260 --> 29:49.220
Everybody's pretty upset.

29:49.220 --> 29:49.780
Everybody stand back.

29:49.780 --> 29:50.900
So many of them.

29:50.900 --> 29:54.100
Let's just, real quick, it's red, it scares the bull away.

29:54.100 --> 29:55.460
And now let's go, now we can go on-

29:55.460 --> 29:56.260
It's red, it's settled.

29:56.260 --> 29:56.760
Yeah.

29:58.580 --> 30:01.620
Everybody's complaining about the bees leaving, and they're upset about it.

30:01.620 --> 30:01.860
Yeah.

30:01.860 --> 30:02.660
And I get it, right?

30:02.660 --> 30:04.420
And it's because bees pollinate flower, right?

30:04.420 --> 30:05.940
Yeah, bees pollinate flower.

30:05.940 --> 30:09.460
Here's what I would say, if bees cared about us,

30:11.140 --> 30:14.100
they would probably just tell us how to do it, right?

30:14.100 --> 30:14.820
How to pollinate a flower?

30:14.820 --> 30:19.540
If the bees would tell us how to do the pollinating, we could do it.

30:19.540 --> 30:20.900
And then they could leave.

30:20.900 --> 30:22.740
They could have told us before they left,

30:23.460 --> 30:26.100
here's the secret, you give it a special little billy tickle,

30:26.100 --> 30:27.060
and then you slip the pollen.

30:27.060 --> 30:28.340
I'm guessing, I don't know.

30:28.340 --> 30:29.940
Well, the answer would probably be like,

30:29.940 --> 30:32.900
well, you rub your bits on it, and then you take your bits,

30:32.900 --> 30:35.140
and you rub it over here on this other flower.

30:35.140 --> 30:36.660
There's a lot of bit dipping.

30:36.660 --> 30:37.140
They've been-

30:37.140 --> 30:39.700
They could have just taught ants, right?

30:39.700 --> 30:40.980
What are ants doing?

30:40.980 --> 30:43.780
Well, they're not flying, Justin.

30:43.780 --> 30:44.740
Listen up, ants.

30:44.740 --> 30:47.300
First things first, you gotta get out of the ground.

30:47.300 --> 30:48.500
Sucks to live down there.

30:48.500 --> 30:49.140
What are you doing?

30:49.140 --> 30:50.340
It's dirty as hell.

30:50.340 --> 30:53.700
Second, I want to talk about having a wank in the garden,

30:53.700 --> 30:55.860
because that's how we do things around here.

30:55.860 --> 30:57.060
You're bees now, ants.

30:59.780 --> 31:02.020
I'm just saying bees could be ants.

31:02.020 --> 31:04.340
Well, yeah, obviously, obviously.

31:04.340 --> 31:06.500
But without wings, and the bees like,

31:06.500 --> 31:07.540
you gotta get up there,

31:07.540 --> 31:09.700
and you gotta rub your bits on that flower.

31:09.700 --> 31:11.380
Every time the ant gets up there, it's like,

31:12.420 --> 31:13.300
all right, let's do this.

31:13.300 --> 31:16.100
And it's gotta like climb up the flower stem,

31:16.100 --> 31:17.300
and then it gets up there, and it's like,

31:17.300 --> 31:18.500
well, I don't want to rub my bits on there.

31:18.500 --> 31:19.380
Or maybe it gets up there,

31:19.380 --> 31:21.860
and somebody's already rubbing their bits on the flower.

31:21.860 --> 31:24.500
And it's, I mean, also, ants are just so strong-juiced,

31:24.500 --> 31:26.500
so when they get up there and they try to crank off,

31:26.500 --> 31:28.900
they're gonna rip their members, dude.

31:28.900 --> 31:30.580
Yeah, dude, that's actually true.

31:30.580 --> 31:31.060
Yeah, dude.

31:31.860 --> 31:33.460
Hey, let's take a break.

31:33.460 --> 31:34.100
Rip them right up.

31:34.100 --> 31:36.340
Punch a hole right through their thorax, dude.

31:36.340 --> 31:38.660
These ants aren't gonna be cranking.

31:38.660 --> 31:56.820
Uh, yeah, so we forgot to record the freaking ads, man.

31:56.820 --> 31:58.900
And I don't have an excuse for it.

31:58.900 --> 32:00.660
If you're looking for excuses,

32:00.660 --> 32:02.420
go somewhere the hell else,

32:02.420 --> 32:04.660
um, because we just forgot.

32:04.660 --> 32:07.380
Uh, we recorded like a bunch of my bim-bams.

32:07.380 --> 32:08.820
This, no, you know what?

32:08.820 --> 32:11.060
This, this ain't over the plate, is it?

32:11.060 --> 32:12.500
This one's pretty far off the plate.

32:13.060 --> 32:15.620
So, uh, I'm just gonna do the ads real quick,

32:15.620 --> 32:17.460
and we'll pretend like this never happened.

32:17.460 --> 32:20.260
I mean, pretend like you heard the ads and act on them,

32:20.260 --> 32:22.660
because that makes us look, like, really good.

32:22.660 --> 32:24.980
But anyway, our first sponsor is Away.

32:24.980 --> 32:28.020
Away makes very good suitcases.

32:28.020 --> 32:29.700
We have an Away suitcase,

32:29.700 --> 32:34.340
and I recently purchased a second matching Away suitcase,

32:34.340 --> 32:35.620
because I like it a lot.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.540
It's got lots of dope pockets.

32:37.540 --> 32:41.460
It's got these four 360-degree spinner wheels

32:41.460 --> 32:43.220
and a TSA-approved combination lock,

32:43.220 --> 32:44.420
so don't even worry about that.

32:44.980 --> 32:48.900
Uh, and also there's a 100-day trial on everything Away makes

They're sleek, they're stylish,

32:56.820 --> 32:58.740
they can take a, they can take a bangin',

32:59.300 --> 33:01.380
and keep on rollin'.

We are also sponsored by Warby Parker.

33:22.420 --> 33:24.900
Warby Parker, I know, scary name, right?

33:24.900 --> 33:26.660
It's got war right in there,

33:26.660 --> 33:30.260
but you don't need to be scared because it also has park in there.

33:30.260 --> 33:31.780
And parks are great.

33:31.780 --> 33:35.300
They have grass and birds and trees and stuff.

33:36.100 --> 33:38.020
Warby Parker doesn't deal in grass and trees,

33:38.020 --> 33:39.780
they deal in glasses.

33:39.780 --> 33:41.620
They do the home try-on program

33:41.620 --> 33:43.620
where they send you five pairs of glasses

33:43.620 --> 33:45.380
and you try them on for free for five days

33:45.380 --> 33:47.300
and there's no obligation to buy them.

They ship for free

33:48.420 --> 33:50.500
and they include a prepaid return shipping label.

It's called Scout by Warby Parker.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.980
It's made from a, and this is in the copy so I apologize,

34:30.340 --> 34:33.300

34:38.980 --> 34:40.660
Hi, I am Lori Kilmartin.

34:40.660 --> 34:41.940
And I'm Jackie Kishan.

34:41.940 --> 34:44.260
Together we host a podcast called

34:44.260 --> 34:45.540
The Jackie and Lori Show.

34:46.260 --> 34:47.540
We're both stand up comics.

34:48.180 --> 34:49.780
We recently met each other

34:49.780 --> 34:51.540
because women weren't allowed to work together

34:52.260 --> 34:54.660
on the road or in gigs for a long, long time.

34:54.660 --> 34:57.700
And so our friendship has been unfolding on this podcast

34:57.700 --> 34:58.500
for a couple of years.

34:58.500 --> 35:00.340
Jackie constantly works the road.

35:00.340 --> 35:03.300
I write for Conan and then I work the road in between.

35:03.300 --> 35:04.900
We do a lot of stand up comedy.

35:04.900 --> 35:08.580
And so we celebrate stand up and we also bitch about it.

35:08.580 --> 35:09.700
We keep it to an hour.

35:09.700 --> 35:10.820
We don't have any guests.

35:10.820 --> 35:14.340
We somehow find enough to talk about every single week.

35:14.340 --> 35:15.060
So find us.

35:15.060 --> 35:18.580
You can subscribe to The Jackie and Lori Show at maximumfun.org

35:18.580 --> 35:20.260
or wherever you get your podcasts.

35:20.260 --> 35:32.420
Okay, bye.

35:32.420 --> 35:36.900
I want a munch squad.

35:36.900 --> 35:43.060
I want two munch squads.

35:43.060 --> 35:44.020
I'm standing up.

35:44.020 --> 35:44.260
Whoa.

35:44.900 --> 35:45.620
Right down the middle.

35:45.620 --> 35:46.820
This is one that's usually here.

35:46.820 --> 35:47.860
And now it's here again.

35:48.660 --> 35:49.700
Munch squad.

35:49.700 --> 35:50.900
This is a little late.

35:52.420 --> 35:54.260
So we may have missed this promotion, folks.

35:54.260 --> 35:57.300
But I'm sure plenty of you took advantage of it.

35:58.260 --> 36:03.780
Boston Market selling baby back rib bouquets for $29.99.

36:03.780 --> 36:04.660
Holy shit.

36:06.100 --> 36:07.460
Yeah, I think we missed it.

36:07.460 --> 36:10.260
I don't think they're gonna do it on Easter.

36:11.540 --> 36:12.020
Show that.

36:12.020 --> 36:13.860
No, then they just sell crucifixes.

36:13.860 --> 36:14.980
It's two ribs.

36:14.980 --> 36:15.860
It's two.

36:15.860 --> 36:17.380
And a crucifix.

36:17.380 --> 36:17.940
Same price.

36:17.940 --> 36:19.700
The same price.

36:19.700 --> 36:20.740
Still $30.

36:20.740 --> 36:22.020
It's all about the experience.

36:22.020 --> 36:24.820
It's experiential eating at Boston Market.

36:25.380 --> 36:28.260
Hey, we're kind of taking kind of an avant garde approach

36:28.260 --> 36:30.340
to what it means to be Boston Market.

36:31.780 --> 36:35.860
Boston Market is bidding farewell to flowers

36:35.860 --> 36:40.180
and chow to chocolates this Valentine's Day

36:40.180 --> 36:43.060
with a new one of a kind gift.

36:43.060 --> 36:46.980
A romantic bouquet made of its newest menu offering.

36:46.980 --> 36:50.020
Fall off the bone, baby back ribs.

36:50.580 --> 36:54.980
That term has never sounded good to me.

36:54.980 --> 36:57.940
I need it to be on the bone at least

36:57.940 --> 37:00.260
until it reaches the mouth quadrant.

37:00.260 --> 37:04.820
Well, sir, and certainly if your plan is to deliver

37:04.820 --> 37:06.900
a bouquet of them to your lovers,

37:06.900 --> 37:12.500
you wouldn't want them to stick to your ribs, right?

37:12.500 --> 37:13.540
To your ribs, ribs.

37:13.540 --> 37:18.180
With a pile of meat on the floor and a bunch of bones.

37:18.180 --> 37:20.740
Hey, this Valentine's Day, how about a dozen

37:20.740 --> 37:22.500
fall off the stem roses?

37:23.460 --> 37:29.060
Right, it's beautifully assembled with one dozen

37:29.060 --> 37:32.180
tender Boston Market baby back ribs.

37:32.180 --> 37:34.820
The limited edition and sure to be coveted.

37:36.260 --> 37:40.180
Fucking pull up an imaginary store

37:40.180 --> 37:44.340
and then get a seatbelt on your imaginary stool

37:44.340 --> 37:46.420
and strap yourself into it,

37:46.420 --> 37:48.500
because this is about to blast you right out of the water.

37:48.500 --> 37:49.140
Are you ready for this?

37:51.940 --> 37:56.180
The sure to be coveted bay B-A-E

37:57.540 --> 37:59.380
be back ribs bouquet.

37:59.380 --> 38:04.900
The bay be back ribs bouquet will be available

38:04.900 --> 38:08.100
for purchase on Friday, February 14th

38:08.100 --> 38:11.380
in all Boston Market restaurants nationwide

38:11.380 --> 38:14.580
while supplies last for $29.99.

38:14.580 --> 38:17.140
Hey, fuck, it's one day.

38:17.140 --> 38:19.220
So there are people, other humans,

38:19.220 --> 38:21.540
you know, like us people on earth,

38:21.540 --> 38:23.780
that had to spend their life minutes

38:23.780 --> 38:27.060
learning how to make a tasteful rib bouquet

38:27.060 --> 38:29.860
for this fucking punchline of a promotion

38:29.860 --> 38:31.300
that lasts one day.

38:31.300 --> 38:33.060
Hey, Justin, can I just dip in real quick

38:33.060 --> 38:34.740
for a second to touch on that thought?

38:34.740 --> 38:38.660
Because when you say beautifully arranged,

38:38.660 --> 38:39.460
tastefully arranged,

38:41.460 --> 38:45.060
the idea to execution gap that exists there for me

38:45.060 --> 38:46.820
is insurmountable.

38:46.820 --> 38:50.580
I'm going to take these dozen bones

38:50.580 --> 38:53.060
with meat and drippings on them

38:53.060 --> 38:57.140
and arrange them so that a human being

38:57.140 --> 38:59.220
would look upon them with their eye jellies

38:59.220 --> 39:00.980
and say, beautiful.

39:00.980 --> 39:03.380
Well done, well arranged.

39:03.380 --> 39:05.700
These have certainly been touched

39:05.700 --> 39:07.460
more than the usual ribs.

39:07.460 --> 39:08.660
I'm crazy about them.

39:08.660 --> 39:11.540
And even more so that then another human being

39:11.540 --> 39:13.140
with their eye jellies would look

39:13.140 --> 39:15.460
at the new human being holding this

39:15.460 --> 39:17.860
and say, I wish I had that.

39:19.380 --> 39:22.900
And imagine the light in your lover's eyes

39:22.900 --> 39:25.060
and the shame in yours when you admit to them

39:25.060 --> 39:29.380
it costs $30 for this fucking punchline.

39:30.020 --> 39:31.860
When we first toyed with the idea

39:31.860 --> 39:34.020
of adding baby back ribs to our menu.

39:34.020 --> 39:36.100
Wait, wait, wait, they don't even normally

39:36.100 --> 39:37.620
do baby back ribs?

39:38.260 --> 39:39.540
It's a newer offering.

39:40.260 --> 39:41.300
When we first toyed with the idea of adding-

39:41.300 --> 39:43.060
I love the phrase, toyed with the idea,

39:43.060 --> 39:44.340
like, how playful.

39:44.340 --> 39:45.380
Hey, guys, wouldn't it?

39:45.380 --> 39:47.540
I just want to put the tiger on the table

39:47.540 --> 39:49.300
and fucking just yell at it.

39:49.300 --> 39:50.500
Wouldn't it be so funny?

39:50.500 --> 39:52.820
Baby back ribs, so cute and sweet.

39:52.820 --> 39:54.420
Oh my God, baby back ribs to our menu.

39:54.420 --> 39:57.140
We knew we wanted to focus on flavor and quality,

39:57.700 --> 39:59.620
says Chef Tony Fialho,

39:59.620 --> 40:01.700
Director of Culinary Innovation at Boston Market.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.940
That's why we had to put them in a fucking crazy shape.

40:04.820 --> 40:06.740
Nothing says quality like pretending

40:06.740 --> 40:09.300
like baby back ribs are flowers to try to sell them.

40:10.980 --> 40:12.980
That's why we're slow cooking our ribs

40:12.980 --> 40:15.220
to fall off the bone perfection again

40:15.780 --> 40:18.420
before smothering them in sweet baby Ray's

40:18.420 --> 40:20.100
famous hickory barbecue sauce.

40:20.660 --> 40:23.140
We just launched baby back ribs a few weeks ago

40:23.140 --> 40:24.980
and our guests are loving them.

40:25.540 --> 40:27.300
On their own, our baby back ribs

40:27.300 --> 40:30.180
are sure to delight barbecue enthusiasts everywhere.

40:30.180 --> 40:32.340
But when packaged in a delectable bouquet,

40:32.980 --> 40:35.380
they're the picture perfect Valentine's Day gift

40:35.380 --> 40:40.260
to help anyone delight and feed that special someone.

40:40.260 --> 40:42.740
That is one of the things is you have to sit there

40:42.740 --> 40:45.460
and watch your lover consume the entire bouquet.

40:45.460 --> 40:47.380
That is part of the gift.

40:47.380 --> 40:49.380
Boston Market is also inviting guests

40:49.380 --> 40:52.420
to celebrate their bae over a shared plate

40:52.420 --> 40:56.100
of baby back ribs, making it the perfect date night spot

40:56.100 --> 40:57.860
for some Valentine's Day loving.

40:57.860 --> 41:00.740
Oh my God, wait, read that last sentence again,

41:00.740 --> 41:02.580
but slower and deeper.

41:03.860 --> 41:07.620
Boston Market is inviting guests to celebrate their bae

41:07.620 --> 41:10.420
over a shared plate of baby back ribs,

41:10.980 --> 41:13.220
making it the perfect date night spot

41:13.220 --> 41:15.700
for some Valentine's Day loving.

41:15.700 --> 41:18.260
Yes, friends, Boston Market is encouraging you

41:18.260 --> 41:19.140
to fuck in the booth.

41:19.140 --> 41:24.580
Come on in, eat some cornbread and fuck in the booth.

41:24.580 --> 41:28.900
You know, I'm never my most ready for sexual intercourse

41:28.900 --> 41:31.620
than after consuming a bunch of ribs and bread.

41:32.420 --> 41:33.060
In public.

41:34.420 --> 41:35.860
At a Boston Market.

41:35.860 --> 41:36.500
For $30.

41:39.220 --> 41:44.180
On February 14th, pork isn't the only pork at Boston Market.

41:44.740 --> 41:46.180
It's a double entendre.

41:46.900 --> 41:51.860
On February 14th, couples can enjoy a romantic dinner for two,

41:51.860 --> 41:57.220
featuring two half orders of ribs, two sides per person,

41:57.220 --> 41:59.540
and two pieces of cornbread for only $20,

42:00.340 --> 42:03.140
with a coupon available online at Boston Market.

42:03.780 --> 42:04.660
So you're telling me,

42:06.260 --> 42:11.860
I can get a dozen ribs plus extras plus some bonuses

42:12.900 --> 42:17.380
and then arrange them myself and saved a 10 spot

42:17.380 --> 42:18.340
is what you're telling me?

42:18.340 --> 42:21.780
Yeah, I don't know how much you're in the portion.

42:21.780 --> 42:26.820
10, half rack is like, it's gotta be more ribs for 20,

42:26.820 --> 42:30.900
but they're upcharging you, although you know what?

42:30.900 --> 42:32.580
This is the $10 question.

42:32.580 --> 42:34.740
How do you arrange these ribs?

42:34.740 --> 42:36.500
Well, that's a great question, Griffin.

42:36.500 --> 42:38.340
I'm gonna share with you an image.

42:38.340 --> 42:39.060
Oh, cool.

42:39.060 --> 42:42.900
Of what it looked like, and it is troubling.

42:42.900 --> 42:44.660
And this is a promotional image.

42:45.620 --> 42:47.060
I'm sharing it in Slack now.

42:47.060 --> 42:49.220
It should be noted that this is not an image

42:49.220 --> 42:51.460
of like someone at home got this,

42:51.460 --> 42:55.380
or this is what it looked like in their perfect-

42:55.380 --> 42:57.460
I wish, I'm gonna need to tweet this one out

42:57.460 --> 43:01.620
because the way these ribs descend to the stem

43:01.620 --> 43:03.540
does not make sense.

43:03.540 --> 43:06.100
It can't possibly be anything.

43:06.100 --> 43:08.740
It also kind of looks for this promotional image.

43:08.740 --> 43:13.700
Like they took kind of like big hunks of like wet newspaper

43:13.700 --> 43:16.260
and dipped it in like mud and chocolate.

43:16.260 --> 43:18.340
Chocolate and said, delicious.

43:19.780 --> 43:22.660
This next part isn't germane to the story,

43:23.380 --> 43:24.980
but it is, they've thrown it in here.

43:26.420 --> 43:29.860
Boston Market fans can also spread the love even further

43:29.860 --> 43:31.940
when enjoying the new baby back ribs

43:31.940 --> 43:33.460
or any of their other favorites

43:33.460 --> 43:37.380
thanks to the recently launched Rotisserie Rewards program.

43:38.420 --> 43:41.860
The loyalty program available via the new Boston Market

43:41.860 --> 43:46.260
mobile app for iOS and Android online at bostonmarket.com

43:46.260 --> 43:46.900
or inRestaurant.

43:46.900 --> 43:48.100
Are you doing that intentionally?

43:48.980 --> 43:49.700
What?

43:49.700 --> 43:52.260
The ellenbarkinrestaurant.com.

43:52.260 --> 43:55.860
Bostonmarket.com or inRestaurant

43:55.860 --> 43:58.580
allows customers to earn one point for every dollar

43:58.580 --> 44:00.980
they spend in restaurant or online.

44:03.620 --> 44:09.540
Can you guys imagine what it would be like

44:09.540 --> 44:12.260
to order your food at Boston Market

44:12.260 --> 44:14.660
and then say, hold on a second.

44:15.460 --> 44:19.140
I'm a member of the Rotisserie Rewards program

44:19.140 --> 44:21.940
and I want to make sure I'm credited the points

44:22.500 --> 44:24.180
for these ribs I'm buying.

44:24.900 --> 44:28.260
I'm not eating these ribs for my enjoyment.

44:28.900 --> 44:31.540
This is work to me.

44:31.540 --> 44:32.100
I need these points.

44:32.100 --> 44:33.620
You probably recognize me.

44:33.620 --> 44:35.060
I'm part of the club.

44:35.060 --> 44:39.300
So anyway, Boston Market is making a truly delectable

44:39.300 --> 44:40.420
Valentine's Day mistake.

44:40.420 --> 44:41.460
I'm sorry we missed it.

44:41.460 --> 44:42.740
I'm sorry we couldn't get out there

44:42.740 --> 44:45.620
and warn people about it ahead of time.

44:45.620 --> 44:47.940
But here's a quick Yahoo.

44:47.940 --> 44:49.460
And this one was sent in by Toasty Feet.

44:49.460 --> 44:50.180
Thanks, Toasty Feet.

44:50.180 --> 44:51.780
It's anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

44:52.340 --> 44:54.020
I'm going to call him Blaze asks,

44:56.500 --> 45:00.420
corn with a K, future Super Bowl halftime show?

45:00.980 --> 45:02.260
Oh boy.

45:02.260 --> 45:06.260
Will corn, with a K, ever be selected to do a Super Bowl halftime show?

45:07.220 --> 45:09.620
And then first response here three days ago,

45:09.620 --> 45:13.060
Conley 39 says, it's possible, but unlikely.

45:13.060 --> 45:17.380
Well, that's true of anyone being announced.

45:17.380 --> 45:19.220
They could say we're doing a live my brother,

45:19.220 --> 45:21.460
my brother and me for the, it's possible?

45:22.020 --> 45:24.340
I just side note, I'd rather see corn.

45:24.340 --> 45:25.700
Yeah, no fucking kidding, man.

45:25.700 --> 45:28.020
Corn, corn rips ass, dude.

45:28.020 --> 45:34.500
Okay, here's where it was at, here's where it was at.

45:34.500 --> 45:38.820
If corn did the halftime show, here's how it would go.

45:39.620 --> 45:41.540
The first two or three minutes,

45:41.540 --> 45:44.420
you'd be laughing your fucking brains.

45:44.420 --> 45:46.740
It would be so fucking hysterical

45:46.740 --> 45:49.220
that corn was doing the halftime show.

45:49.220 --> 45:52.100
And then like five to seven minutes in,

45:52.100 --> 45:57.460
they'd probably do like a really obscure cover of some cool song.

45:57.460 --> 45:59.940
And I think, I feel like by the middle of it,

45:59.940 --> 46:04.100
you'd be like, hey, this kind of rips ass, hey, weird.

46:04.100 --> 46:05.540
Maybe I fucking love this.

46:05.540 --> 46:07.540
Actually, this kind of fucking rules,

46:07.540 --> 46:09.380
like this kind of rips ass, doesn't it?

46:09.380 --> 46:11.700
Wait, did we all forget that maybe Freak on a Leash

46:11.700 --> 46:13.220
wasn't like a bad song?

46:15.140 --> 46:19.140
Like this, it's kind of fun with your friends

46:19.140 --> 46:21.700
when you're all palling around and having a few laughs

46:21.700 --> 46:26.980
to be like, but when he does it in the context of this song,

46:26.980 --> 46:28.900
it actually kind of beats ass.

46:29.860 --> 46:32.660
Okay, this is a real Yahoo for adults.

46:32.660 --> 46:33.620
Grace sent it in.

46:33.620 --> 46:37.700
It's anonymous Yahoo Answers user, I'm gonna call JJ, asks,

46:38.500 --> 46:41.220
what would happen if I trolled a poker game in Las Vegas?

46:42.580 --> 46:44.340
Say that I'm in a Las Vegas strip casino

46:44.340 --> 46:45.780
and I go to the bar on the casino floor

46:45.780 --> 46:47.300
and order the largest beer they have.

46:48.020 --> 46:49.460
Then I walk over to the poker room

46:49.460 --> 46:50.660
where people are playing poker

46:50.660 --> 46:52.820
and I fling the beer out of the mug at the table.

46:52.820 --> 46:54.660
Then people are playing poker one moment

46:54.660 --> 46:57.380
and all of a sudden a tsunami of beer comes splashing down

46:57.380 --> 46:59.620
all over the table, the cards, and the chips.

46:59.620 --> 47:02.580
Then I make a run for it, beelining for the nearest exit.

47:02.580 --> 47:04.420
And in some casinos, the nearest exit

47:04.420 --> 47:07.780
is not far away from the poker room, lol.

47:07.780 --> 47:08.660
What would come of that?

47:10.660 --> 47:14.180
Okay, can I just say, I love that this person

47:14.180 --> 47:16.020
asked the question, what would happen?

47:16.020 --> 47:18.180
And then describes what would happen.

47:18.820 --> 47:20.980
I throw it and then I have to run away

47:20.980 --> 47:22.820
because I assume people will be chasing me

47:22.820 --> 47:24.660
because I'd be very much in trouble.

47:24.660 --> 47:25.700
Lots of people play poker.

47:25.700 --> 47:27.940
Lots of people play poker and it's a pro sport

47:27.940 --> 47:30.100
and a lot of people are playing poker these days.

47:32.340 --> 47:38.180
But I feel like there's a lot of room left at the table,

47:39.380 --> 47:41.140
the gambling table where they play poker,

47:42.500 --> 47:48.020
for advanced stratagems like this one.

47:48.020 --> 47:51.220
Obviously, this is like 90% of what poker is.

47:51.220 --> 47:52.740
People will tell you it's about how you bet

47:52.740 --> 47:54.260
or how you play the card, no.

47:54.260 --> 47:56.180
It's about the showmanship.

47:56.180 --> 47:58.740
It's like, maybe you've partnered

47:58.740 --> 48:00.340
with the beer throwing person.

48:00.340 --> 48:02.100
Oh, this person's on a hot streak.

48:02.100 --> 48:02.980
I gotta ice them.

48:03.540 --> 48:06.820
I'll signal the Bobby to throw some natty light on the table.

48:06.820 --> 48:08.020
Oh, what's that?

48:08.020 --> 48:10.420
And that's, I mean, this person has obviously

48:10.420 --> 48:13.940
unlocked the door for us and ushered in a new era.

48:13.940 --> 48:14.580
And that's great.

48:14.580 --> 48:16.820
But I can think of like a hundred different ways

48:16.820 --> 48:18.900
we could just go ahead and bump it up.

48:18.900 --> 48:21.620
We can escalate it to the next level.

48:21.620 --> 48:27.300
So you're playing and you've got pocket rockets, baby.

48:27.300 --> 48:30.340
And the flush, the flop comes out.

48:30.340 --> 48:32.100
It's like two, two, three.

48:32.100 --> 48:34.100
And you're like, fuck, yeah, I got this all in.

48:34.100 --> 48:36.100
The other person's like, I'm all in.

48:36.100 --> 48:38.180
And then they flop a four of a kind.

48:38.180 --> 48:39.860
And you're stuck there with your pocket rockets

48:39.860 --> 48:41.380
like a real dipshit.

48:41.380 --> 48:46.180
And then the poker champ, the poker umpire, yeah.

48:47.220 --> 48:47.860
Devilfish.

48:47.860 --> 48:51.700
Well, the umpire, you're playing against Devilfish.

48:51.700 --> 48:53.060
And the poker umpire is like-

48:53.060 --> 48:54.100
I just wanna make sure he's in the mix.

48:54.100 --> 48:54.500
Yeah.

48:54.500 --> 48:55.140
Devilfish is there.

48:55.140 --> 48:56.580
And also Richard Kind is there.

48:56.580 --> 48:57.540
Richard Kind is there.

48:58.100 --> 49:01.140
He's having a fucking great, he's losing a lot.

49:01.140 --> 49:02.820
But he's having the time of his fucking life.

49:03.620 --> 49:05.860
I lose to Devilfish with my pocket rockets.

49:05.860 --> 49:08.580
And they're like, oops, oh, sorry, Griffin.

49:08.580 --> 49:10.100
You lost with your pocket rockets.

49:10.660 --> 49:15.700
I think I should be like, ah, but like I don't,

49:15.700 --> 49:19.380
but like I'm not gonna give you my chips this time.

49:19.380 --> 49:19.540
Yes.

49:19.540 --> 49:23.140
Because the cards I had were really good.

49:23.140 --> 49:25.380
And the cards you had were really good also.

49:25.380 --> 49:27.540
But I'm gonna hold on to my chips this time.

49:27.540 --> 49:30.820
And like, I don't think there's much you can do about it.

49:30.820 --> 49:34.660
Well, this is where the old double or nothing maneuver comes in.

49:34.660 --> 49:35.380
Oh, nice.

49:35.380 --> 49:38.180
You lose, but then you just yell, double or nothing.

49:38.820 --> 49:40.980
And no one really knows what that means.

49:40.980 --> 49:43.220
But if the person agrees and you win,

49:43.220 --> 49:46.100
then you don't have to give them anything.

49:46.100 --> 49:46.900
I think it's out.

49:46.900 --> 49:48.260
Or you get double.

49:48.260 --> 49:49.780
I'm not really sure.

49:49.780 --> 49:51.780
Can I tell you what my go-to maneuver is?

49:52.740 --> 49:55.780
My go-to, because I, you know, I play the rooms.

49:55.780 --> 49:56.420
You know what I mean?

49:56.420 --> 49:56.900
I'm out there.

49:56.900 --> 49:57.460
I'm on the felt.

49:57.460 --> 49:59.300
I'm kind of a felt jockey, you know?

49:59.300 --> 50:00.660
I'm playing the green felt.

50:00.660 --> 50:01.940
You'll flip the ponies.

50:01.940 --> 50:02.900
Yeah, I'll flip the ponies.

50:02.900 --> 50:03.540
You know what I mean?

50:03.540 --> 50:05.300
Like, I'll dig with the spades.

50:05.300 --> 50:05.860
You know what I mean?

50:05.860 --> 50:08.020
I'll eat the clovers.

50:08.020 --> 50:09.460
I'll break some hearts.

50:09.460 --> 50:10.900
I'll cut some diamonds.

50:10.900 --> 50:11.540
You get it.

50:11.540 --> 50:12.900
Well, these are all card terms.

50:12.900 --> 50:13.700
These are what people say.

50:13.700 --> 50:15.380
You'll put some dice in your butt.

50:15.380 --> 50:16.420
Yeah, exactly.

50:16.420 --> 50:17.780
Thank you, Griffin, right?

50:17.780 --> 50:20.100
I'm a chipper.

50:20.100 --> 50:22.500
And if I look at my cards, right?

50:22.500 --> 50:23.380
I've stuck in.

50:23.380 --> 50:24.900
I've called every bet.

50:25.620 --> 50:26.900
Then I realize I'm losing.

50:26.900 --> 50:28.580
And there's no way I could win.

50:28.580 --> 50:30.500
I pull a deck of cards out of my pocket,

50:30.500 --> 50:31.540
and I start dealing them.

50:32.100 --> 50:32.580
Oh, man.

50:32.580 --> 50:34.100
And I deal them out to everyone else, right?

50:34.100 --> 50:37.300
And now we're playing simultaneous hands of poker.

50:37.300 --> 50:39.540
And maybe they've forgotten which cards

50:39.540 --> 50:40.980
are going with which game, you know?

50:40.980 --> 50:42.740
And I can just flip flop.

50:42.740 --> 50:44.340
And that's where the term flop comes from.

50:45.140 --> 50:48.340
Exchange my cards for other cards from my other hand,

50:48.980 --> 50:50.980
and I win both hands now.

50:50.980 --> 50:54.020
There's a lot of silly stuff you could do at the table

50:54.020 --> 50:56.580
to get everything all scrambled and mixed around.

50:56.580 --> 50:56.820
Yeah.

50:56.820 --> 50:59.460
You know, you could also a big fan.

50:59.460 --> 51:00.660
A big fan, guys.

51:00.660 --> 51:01.300
Big fan.

51:01.300 --> 51:03.860
Like no one's even thought of a big fan yet.

51:03.860 --> 51:05.300
And you don't even need electricity.

51:05.300 --> 51:08.580
It could be like one of those like big just hand fans.

51:08.580 --> 51:08.740
Yeah.

51:09.700 --> 51:12.420
And you could blow the game away.

51:12.420 --> 51:15.060
Sometimes I also will just take my hand on all my chips,

51:15.060 --> 51:16.420
and I'll put them at the front of my shirt

51:16.420 --> 51:17.460
and pretend like I'm pregnant.

51:18.020 --> 51:18.500
Yeah.

51:18.500 --> 51:21.780
Or I'll dribble someone else's chips like behind their head.

51:22.660 --> 51:23.140
Yeah.

51:23.140 --> 51:24.820
And I'm like, oh, what's that?

51:24.820 --> 51:25.940
I've got extended arms.

51:26.660 --> 51:28.740
Do you ever palm a real chip

51:29.380 --> 51:31.620
and then raise one of the poker chips to your mouth

51:31.620 --> 51:33.780
and then secretly eat the real chip?

51:33.780 --> 51:34.180
Oh, yeah.

51:34.180 --> 51:35.300
Just be like, get it?

51:35.940 --> 51:37.940
And that's a great strategy.

51:37.940 --> 51:40.820
You could also just like when you're the short stack,

51:40.820 --> 51:42.660
you could just be like, I'm all in.

51:42.660 --> 51:43.940
And then you pick up all your chips

51:43.940 --> 51:46.580
and you throw them into another player's chip pile.

51:46.580 --> 51:49.300
And then you point and say, hey, some of those are mine

51:49.300 --> 51:50.900
and they don't know how many.

51:50.900 --> 51:51.460
Yeah.

51:51.460 --> 51:52.500
And here's the thing.

51:52.500 --> 51:54.980
If anybody gets too mad at you about any of these stunts,

51:56.660 --> 51:58.180
there's a new secret life hack

51:58.180 --> 52:00.260
I've been working on right here, okay?

52:00.260 --> 52:03.060
If anybody gets too mad at you about any of these stunts,

52:03.060 --> 52:04.340
here's a foolproof plan

52:04.340 --> 52:07.060
that'll get you out of almost any situation once.

52:07.060 --> 52:10.740
Once you look at them and you get embarrassed

52:10.740 --> 52:14.260
and you say, I'm sorry, we're filming in Xenoman 2.

52:15.140 --> 52:18.820
And then you point, see, there's the camera over there.

52:18.820 --> 52:21.220
And when they look at the camera, you run away.

52:22.340 --> 52:24.100
That would work pretty much anytime

52:24.100 --> 52:25.460
you've done something embarrassing.

52:25.460 --> 52:27.220
Because like, of course, this caveman,

52:28.820 --> 52:30.740
I mean, I've barely laid the groundwork for it.

52:30.740 --> 52:32.420
But yeah, unless, I guess, unless what?

52:32.420 --> 52:33.380
Imagine this, Justin.

52:33.380 --> 52:34.500
You do something embarrassing.

52:34.500 --> 52:36.660
You say, I'm filming in Xenoman 2.

52:36.660 --> 52:38.500
Oh no, the person you're embarrassed in front of

52:38.500 --> 52:39.540
is Brendan Fraser.

52:39.540 --> 52:41.620
And he's like, I know you're not filming in Xenoman 2

52:41.620 --> 52:43.540
because I get first look at Xenoman 2.

52:43.540 --> 52:44.580
No one showed me a script for Xenoman 2.

52:44.580 --> 52:45.700
Hey Trav, hey Trav.

52:45.700 --> 52:48.180
Or he's like, or he's deeply wounded.

52:49.060 --> 52:49.940
Wait a minute.

52:49.940 --> 52:52.820
Are you, wow, okay.

52:53.540 --> 52:55.700
Ouch, this one hurts.

52:55.700 --> 52:59.700
I guarantee he got last of my refusal on that one, right?

52:59.700 --> 53:01.060
When they tried to book him originally,

53:01.060 --> 53:04.740
they got Sean Assin, we got the weasel.

53:04.740 --> 53:07.780
And now we need to get the phrase.

53:07.780 --> 53:10.100
And he was like, I'll do it on one condition

53:10.100 --> 53:13.860
for any future Xenomans, I get right of last refusal.

53:13.860 --> 53:14.740
And last rights.

53:16.020 --> 53:20.340
I don't think poker players should get to think

53:21.620 --> 53:24.660
that they're cool as they are.

53:25.700 --> 53:28.820
I think poker players wear the upside down visors

53:28.820 --> 53:32.020
and sunglasses and they smoke big stogies.

53:32.020 --> 53:34.900
And they have cool names like Devil Fish.

53:34.900 --> 53:38.980
And they drive big, cool, loud cars.

53:38.980 --> 53:43.300
And they think they're so big and cool, right?

53:43.300 --> 53:46.260
Hey guys, you're playing board games.

53:47.380 --> 53:49.620
You're basically playing a board game.

53:49.620 --> 53:51.060
Like, you know what I mean?

53:51.860 --> 53:53.140
Yeah, but we have a whole show

53:53.140 --> 53:54.580
where we play Dungeons and Dragons.

53:54.580 --> 53:55.700
And I like to walk around with those

53:55.700 --> 53:58.180
upside down visors and sunglasses inside and stuff.

53:59.140 --> 54:00.900
I'm just saying.

54:00.900 --> 54:03.460
Pauly Shore wants to make Xenoman 2.

54:03.460 --> 54:05.620
I found this story from 2014, he's in.

54:05.620 --> 54:07.140
Okay, we got the weasel.

54:08.180 --> 54:09.220
The weasel wants to do it.

54:09.220 --> 54:10.500
It's probably so picky too.

54:11.700 --> 54:15.060
Xenoman 2, let's do it, he said.

54:15.060 --> 54:17.300
My agent and I are talking about it.

54:17.300 --> 54:21.460
Looks like the writer, Sean Sheps of the 1992 original,

54:21.460 --> 54:23.780
quote, already has an idea for the story

54:23.780 --> 54:24.980
but hasn't written it yet.

54:25.540 --> 54:27.140
So that's a roadblock.

54:27.140 --> 54:28.980
Do you think the idea for this story is

54:28.980 --> 54:30.820
there's a caveman of some sort

54:30.820 --> 54:32.580
and he's doing something in Encino?

54:33.620 --> 54:37.300
He's got kids and one of them is half caveman.

54:37.300 --> 54:39.300
He's giving the kids caveman disease

54:39.300 --> 54:41.060
and he can't live with himself.

54:41.060 --> 54:42.100
I'm sorry, Justin.

54:42.100 --> 54:44.580
If you remember correctly, at the end of the movie,

54:44.580 --> 54:47.060
there's also a cave woman who appears

54:47.060 --> 54:50.260
and she and caveman appear to be happy together.

54:50.260 --> 54:50.580
Maybe.

54:52.100 --> 54:55.860
He's Encino man, the first of the Geico cavemen.

54:55.860 --> 55:00.260
So it sounds like we've got an idea for the story

55:00.260 --> 55:01.620
and haven't written it yet.

55:02.260 --> 55:06.180
So one might say our little small corporation

55:06.740 --> 55:09.140
also is ready to make Encino Man 2

55:09.700 --> 55:12.820
and is as close as Mr. Sheps.

55:12.820 --> 55:13.940
We've been talking about it.

55:14.980 --> 55:16.580
Can we start the episode over

55:16.580 --> 55:20.500
and just make it kind of storyboarding Encino Man 2?

55:20.500 --> 55:22.500
Just really nailing these beats down.

55:22.500 --> 55:24.660
Now we know what episode 500 is gonna be.

55:24.660 --> 55:28.340
Sir, it's just gonna be us perfecting our pitch

55:28.340 --> 55:29.620
for Encino Man 2.

55:29.620 --> 55:31.940
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast,

55:31.940 --> 55:32.980
my brother, my brother and me.

55:32.980 --> 55:34.180
We hope you've enjoyed yourself

55:35.300 --> 55:39.300
and we hope that you are having a good day.

55:39.300 --> 55:41.860
I don't know if we ever say that, but I feel that.

55:41.860 --> 55:42.420
I feel that.

55:42.420 --> 55:43.700
I hope you're having a good day.

55:44.820 --> 55:46.740
I don't know when this episode is posting.

55:46.740 --> 55:49.540
So it's kind of hard for me to articulate much more than that.

55:49.540 --> 55:51.220
But gosh, I hope it's a good one.

55:51.220 --> 55:53.140
I can do big general announcements.

55:53.140 --> 55:57.780
One, tickets went on sale last week for our new live show tour.

55:57.780 --> 55:59.860
Maybe they're sold out, but if they're not,

55:59.860 --> 56:02.340
you should go to McElroy.family, click on tours,

56:03.060 --> 56:04.100
get tickets there.

56:04.100 --> 56:08.180
A bunch of shows, some stuff in Norfolk, Virginia,

56:09.140 --> 56:10.820
stuff at Foxwoods Casino.

56:10.820 --> 56:11.300
It's all there.

56:11.300 --> 56:12.740
There's a bunch of dates.

56:12.740 --> 56:13.940
Go check that out.

56:13.940 --> 56:16.740
Also, the Adventure Zone graphic novel,

56:16.740 --> 56:18.740
Three Pedals to the Metal, it's coming out in July.

56:18.740 --> 56:20.900
If you haven't pre-ordered yet, what are you waiting for?

56:20.900 --> 56:22.340
It's gonna be our best one yet.

56:22.340 --> 56:24.020
I'm not just saying that to be cute.

56:24.020 --> 56:26.020
It's really good, and I'm really proud of it.

56:26.020 --> 56:28.260
You can go to theadventurezonecomic.com

56:28.980 --> 56:30.500
and pre-order it now.

56:30.500 --> 56:32.580
That helps us a lot.

56:32.580 --> 56:34.260
Everybody's so supportive of the book.

56:34.260 --> 56:37.860
And when it comes out, people are always showing their support

56:37.860 --> 56:39.860
and showing that they got it and shared it with their friends.

56:39.860 --> 56:43.300
But the pre-order stuff really does help us out in a major way.

56:43.300 --> 56:45.060
So think about it if you haven't done it yet.

56:45.060 --> 56:47.940
And you can also, as always, go check out McElroyMerch.com

56:47.940 --> 56:51.140
to see all of our fun merchandise stuff there.

56:51.140 --> 56:52.340
It's great.

56:52.340 --> 56:53.940
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters

56:53.940 --> 56:56.100
for the theme song, It's a Departure,

56:56.100 --> 56:57.780
off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

56:59.380 --> 57:03.380
And that one's been there for us.

57:03.380 --> 57:06.340
That one's right down the fucking middle.

57:06.340 --> 57:08.100
That one's right across the plate.

57:08.820 --> 57:11.060
And we are just so appreciative.

57:12.100 --> 57:15.540
Maximum Fun is also on the play, and we love them for it.

57:15.540 --> 57:18.180
Speaking of, Max Fun Drive is coming up

57:18.820 --> 57:19.540
middle of March.

57:19.540 --> 57:20.660
We're gonna have a lot of cool-

57:20.660 --> 57:22.580
Can we say what our episode was?

57:22.580 --> 57:24.020
I feel like we should talk about it.

57:24.020 --> 57:24.820
Yeah, go for it, Griffin.

57:24.820 --> 57:25.300
You know what?

57:25.300 --> 57:26.580
I'm gonna make the call and say yes.

57:27.300 --> 57:29.300
I mean, we do crank calls.

57:29.300 --> 57:30.340
Yeah, we do crank calls.

57:31.060 --> 57:32.900
And it goes super good.

57:32.900 --> 57:34.900
Yeah, we're really good at prank calling.

57:34.900 --> 57:37.060
It's not, you may hear that and think,

57:37.060 --> 57:38.900
but these boys wouldn't be good at that.

57:38.900 --> 57:40.180
That'll be a rough listen.

57:40.180 --> 57:42.260
It's, y'all, it's a fun time.

57:42.260 --> 57:43.300
And we can say that.

57:43.300 --> 57:44.660
We say it's crank calls.

57:44.660 --> 57:46.020
Really, we're just having fun.

57:46.020 --> 57:48.260
And you'll like it too.

57:48.260 --> 57:50.740
And you can get that if you are a donor

57:50.740 --> 57:53.540
or you can become a donor during the Max Fun Drive

57:53.540 --> 57:54.900
or you can be an upgrading donor.

57:54.900 --> 57:56.420
All those things, middle of March,

57:56.420 --> 57:58.180
we're gonna have a lot of fun bonus content,

57:58.180 --> 58:00.180
both for donors only and a lot of stuff

58:01.220 --> 58:02.980
that's just gonna come out on our YouTube

58:02.980 --> 58:04.340
and in our thread.

58:04.340 --> 58:05.380
And yeah, it's gonna be great.

58:05.380 --> 58:06.500
We're gonna have a great time.

58:06.500 --> 58:08.020
I haven't told you boys this yet,

58:08.020 --> 58:10.180
but I edited our crank call episode

58:10.740 --> 58:14.820
and we didn't record, we recorded quite a bit

58:14.820 --> 58:18.420
and it did end up being about 35 minutes long.

58:18.420 --> 58:21.860
So that's about the hit rate we were working with.

58:21.860 --> 58:24.820
But it's 35 minutes of pure good cranks

58:24.820 --> 58:26.500
and how about a final Yahoo?

58:26.500 --> 58:27.300
Yes.

58:27.300 --> 58:30.340
This final Yahoo was sent in by a bunch of folks actually.

58:30.340 --> 58:31.460
Thank you, everybody.

58:31.460 --> 58:33.220
Another anonymous Yahoo Answers user

58:33.220 --> 58:38.420
who I'm going to call Schneider asks,

58:38.420 --> 58:43.300
why are chihuahuas so expensive when they're so little,

58:43.300 --> 58:44.820
not really getting your money's worth?

58:48.820 --> 58:50.500
My name is Justin McElroy.

58:50.500 --> 58:51.460
I'm Travis McElroy.

58:51.460 --> 58:52.500
I'm Griffin McElroy.

58:53.220 --> 58:54.260
It's been my brother, my brother,

58:54.260 --> 59:09.460
may you kiss your dad's square on the lips.
