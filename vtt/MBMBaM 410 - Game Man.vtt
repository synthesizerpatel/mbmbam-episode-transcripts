00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.920
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

00:47.920 --> 00:51.840
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:51.840 --> 00:55.520
I'm your middle brother, Travis Mario McElroy.

00:55.520 --> 01:00.880
I'm your sweet baby brother, Crash Griffin McElroy Bandicoot.

01:00.880 --> 01:02.480
It's time to power up!

01:03.440 --> 01:06.560
That's the stinger that I produced.

01:08.880 --> 01:10.400
Yeah, do you want to hear it again?

01:10.400 --> 01:13.680
Yeah, click play on it because I know you pre-recorded it and play it again.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.240
It's time to power up!

01:16.880 --> 01:18.560
That was really good, Justin.

01:18.560 --> 01:26.400
Yeah, we're getting pumped for the triple, Electronic 3. We are psyched out of our minds,

01:26.400 --> 01:30.400
not going. So stoked for it this time.

01:30.400 --> 01:33.040
Well, you can take the boy out of the games industry,

01:33.040 --> 01:36.080
but you can't take the games out of the boy because I swallowed like

01:36.080 --> 01:40.800
14 Nintendo DS cartridges back in 2009 and hadn't seen them yet.

01:40.800 --> 01:45.600
I swallowed a lot of those Switch cartridges. They tasted bad, but I couldn't help it.

01:45.600 --> 01:49.600
Yeah, you get them down fast enough you don't get the taste in your mouth. Nice try though, Reggie.

01:49.600 --> 01:51.920
Can I tell you guys what I'm really excited about at E3?

01:52.480 --> 01:53.920
Yeah, I know what it is.

01:53.920 --> 01:57.440
Justin has reminded me of it, or I saw it was Griffin.

01:57.440 --> 02:02.240
I can't wait for that new Crash Bandicoot game starring Randy Bandicoot.

02:02.880 --> 02:07.920
Yeah, we all love Randy Bandicoot. He's the nasty Crash Bandicoot who cusses and-

02:07.920 --> 02:11.280
Finally an NC-17 Crash Bandicoot game.

02:11.280 --> 02:15.760
And with Randy, you get all the jeans. He doesn't cut them off at the calf.

02:15.760 --> 02:22.160
He goes full ankle jeans and he cusses and has a gun. So we're all-

02:22.160 --> 02:23.600
I'm looking forward to that.

02:24.160 --> 02:25.520
We all love Randy Coot.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.920
I'm going to say this, but I'm not sure that I'm correct.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.640
I believe Randy Bandicoot is owned by Nintendo,

02:30.640 --> 02:33.840
so that's probably going to be the big Nintendo installation this year.

02:33.840 --> 02:37.280
I think 2016, it was Zelda.

02:37.280 --> 02:41.440
2017, it was Mario. 2018, Randy Bandicoot.

02:41.440 --> 02:42.720
Randy Bandicoot, love it.

02:42.720 --> 02:45.280
There's a new Mario everybody's looking forward to.

02:45.280 --> 02:47.440
This time it's sort of more serious.

02:48.080 --> 02:52.000
And he's older in this one. He's like 70.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.280
So old Mario's coming out.

02:55.840 --> 02:58.080
And then this one, I think he's got a grandson.

02:58.800 --> 03:03.360
And he's teaching his grandson about how toxic masculinity is bad.

03:03.360 --> 03:08.720
And he's like, you use your rage to fight, but you use your heart to temper it.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.640
What are you looking forward to, Justin?

03:10.640 --> 03:15.680
The Master Chef, that's right, Gordon Ramsay, is back in Halo.

03:15.680 --> 03:16.800
And it's just called that.

03:17.360 --> 03:18.000
Yeah, sure.

03:18.640 --> 03:20.080
And that's all we know so far.

03:20.080 --> 03:23.040
But we can speculate about what's going to happen in the game.

03:23.040 --> 03:26.240
Yeah, it's almost like the developers of Halo panicked

03:26.240 --> 03:29.120
because they couldn't think of a funny joke fast enough.

03:29.120 --> 03:31.840
And so they just sort of said the first thing that came to their mind.

03:31.840 --> 03:34.880
Now, why would they be trying to come up with a joke, Griffin?

03:34.880 --> 03:36.000
That doesn't make sense.

03:36.560 --> 03:38.000
PlayStation 5.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.360
Oh, okay.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.640
I've been out of the loop a little bit.

03:44.640 --> 03:50.880
Is PlayStation 5 going to be a sort of going concern at the big day?

03:50.880 --> 03:53.760
I'm looking forward to Xbox XXD.

03:53.760 --> 03:56.080
I'm looking forward to Ubisoft press conference.

03:56.080 --> 03:59.520
Tony Hawk is supposed to come out and just apologize to everyone.

03:59.520 --> 04:01.040
And that's something I've been looking for.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.040
I mean, I need that to move on.

04:03.040 --> 04:06.960
Now, Griffin, you said you were worried about excluding people.

04:06.960 --> 04:11.040
So if you don't follow video games very closely, you may not have gotten that.

04:11.040 --> 04:13.200
So I was hoping you could take a few minutes

04:13.200 --> 04:15.680
to just explain why that last joke was funny.

04:16.240 --> 04:16.480
Sure.

04:16.480 --> 04:18.000
So here's what happened.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.640
Nintendo press conference 2013.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.200
Nintendo came out and they're like, here's our new system.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.160
Everybody's going to love it.

04:24.160 --> 04:24.880
It's got it all.

04:25.840 --> 04:29.760
Mario, Zelda, the Eternal Darkness 2,

04:29.760 --> 04:31.680
all the games you've been looking forward to.

04:31.680 --> 04:34.320
And this is just the prototype is the only one that we've got,

04:34.320 --> 04:36.960
but it does a billion pixel graphics and is free.

04:36.960 --> 04:40.000
And everybody's, and Tony Hawk doing his dumb shit,

04:40.720 --> 04:43.280
kickflips up onto the stage, knocks it over and breaks it.

04:43.280 --> 04:44.720
So none of us got it.

04:44.720 --> 04:48.560
And instead we got the Wii U, a real bastard of a video game product.

04:49.120 --> 04:53.440
And so he's felt really bad about that for a long time.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.080
I will also say, so as not to exclude people,

04:56.080 --> 04:59.040
if you are going to E3 and you don't care about video games,

04:59.040 --> 05:02.400
um, please, please, please, please get some chicken tenders.

05:02.400 --> 05:02.800
Got you.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.080
Let me know how they are.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.400
Because I'm not going to be able to make it this year.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.680
And chicken tenders are my favorite part of E3.

05:09.680 --> 05:11.440
So if anybody's going to be there,

05:11.440 --> 05:15.120
feel free to tweet pictures to me of your chicken tenders.

05:15.120 --> 05:15.920
Get them.

05:16.480 --> 05:17.440
Let me know how they are.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.560
If you see Big the cat,

05:20.560 --> 05:24.240
please ask him to be a guest on my brother, my brother and me.

05:24.240 --> 05:24.880
Got you.

05:24.880 --> 05:26.720
We would love to have him.

05:26.720 --> 05:27.680
Never had a cat.

05:27.680 --> 05:31.920
I'm excited for, uh, I think I heard some scuttlebutt this year.

05:31.920 --> 05:34.160
Nintendo's got a big announcement.

05:34.160 --> 05:36.640
They're finally ready to release the Game Man.

05:37.680 --> 05:38.000
Yes.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.400
He's all grown up and he's ready to fuck.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.240
Tetris, I mean.

05:44.240 --> 05:45.040
That's right.

05:45.040 --> 05:49.040
Fuck Tetris is the first game announced for the Game Man.

05:49.040 --> 05:52.240
It takes eight very horny AAA batteries.

05:53.680 --> 05:57.440
Very sexual flesh colored AAA batteries.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.040
It takes 16 of them.

05:59.040 --> 06:02.320
Every time you clear a line and you slot that last little, uh,

06:02.320 --> 06:05.760
tetromino into the hole in such a pleasing way,

06:05.760 --> 06:09.840
there's just a dude and he comes in through the bad Game Man speakers

06:09.840 --> 06:10.640
and it's just like,

06:11.440 --> 06:12.160
Oh, yeah.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.840
So don't play this one at church, kids.

06:16.400 --> 06:17.920
Wait, Scott, you like-

06:17.920 --> 06:20.720
Did you like when the Game Boy was black and white?

06:20.720 --> 06:21.360
Well, this-

06:21.360 --> 06:23.920
The Game Man's got a new color and it's jizz.

06:24.880 --> 06:25.520
Oh, no.

06:25.520 --> 06:29.120
Oh, now that word's just there, Justin.

06:29.120 --> 06:29.680
Oh, no.

06:30.320 --> 06:31.120
I didn't say it.

06:31.120 --> 06:35.200
Shigeru Miyamoto said it in his original design document for the Game Man,

06:35.200 --> 06:38.800
recently unearthed by the Library of Congress

06:38.800 --> 06:43.040
and some rogue game developers just made the Game Man

06:43.040 --> 06:45.520
without Nintendo's express written permission.

06:45.520 --> 06:47.360
It's a hub-licensed sequel.

06:47.360 --> 06:49.840
This is the problem I have with the Game Man,

06:49.840 --> 06:54.880
is that I don't mind all the updates they've made to the graphics cards

06:54.880 --> 06:56.560
and the sound cards and all the new game.

06:56.560 --> 06:57.520
That's all great.

06:57.520 --> 07:02.560
Why did they have to give the Game Man realistic muscly arms?

07:02.560 --> 07:06.240
I find it off-putting and they're fully artic-

07:06.240 --> 07:07.840
Like they move on their own.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.000
I do not care for it.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.600
I got knuckle tattoos that say ready to jerk it

07:13.600 --> 07:15.520
and they gave it extra fingers

07:15.520 --> 07:17.760
so it would have room for all those letters.

07:17.760 --> 07:20.560
I got home from work the other day

07:20.560 --> 07:26.240
and my Game Man that Nintendo sent me early, I came home.

07:26.240 --> 07:29.840
He was just grilling up some steaks out on the back porch

07:29.840 --> 07:31.920
and I was like, that's not safe.

07:31.920 --> 07:34.240
And he said, he said, cram it.

07:34.960 --> 07:36.160
Oh, no.

07:36.160 --> 07:37.200
And he kicked my ass.

07:37.760 --> 07:38.480
Yeah.

07:38.480 --> 07:40.720
Oh, no Griffin.

07:41.600 --> 07:44.560
I said, I said, Game Man, what kind of beer do you want?

07:44.560 --> 07:46.080
And he said, bad.

07:46.080 --> 07:48.000
And I said, can you be more specific?

07:48.000 --> 07:49.360
He wants a bad beer?

07:49.360 --> 07:50.720
He said, here.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.240
So that's all he cared about.

07:52.240 --> 07:54.800
He doesn't have a palette for a great beer.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.440
He just wants to guzzle down whatever's around.

07:57.440 --> 08:01.520
He made me do 60 pushups in front of my wife, the Game Man.

08:03.360 --> 08:04.240
I don't care for it.

08:04.240 --> 08:05.760
You know, I'm willing to review it now.

08:05.760 --> 08:08.560
I'll say, listen, maybe they'll do some updates

08:08.560 --> 08:10.480
that will make him not so angry

08:10.480 --> 08:12.320
and I do look forward to that.

08:12.320 --> 08:15.440
But like, come on Nintendo.

08:15.440 --> 08:17.920
He pushed me into an umbrella stand

08:17.920 --> 08:19.840
and said he fixed my car.

08:19.840 --> 08:21.120
But here's the thing, guys.

08:21.120 --> 08:22.480
It wasn't broken.

08:22.480 --> 08:25.680
And I would say on a stack of Bibles, it wasn't broken.

08:25.680 --> 08:28.000
So I don't know what exactly he did.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.320
Now I will say this about the Game Man,

08:30.320 --> 08:34.880
is that I will love this 40 pound mobile game console

08:34.880 --> 08:36.800
that kicks my ass and makes me do pushups

08:36.800 --> 08:39.840
in front of my wife if they just put Animal Crossing on it.

08:39.840 --> 08:41.120
I'll do that for you.

08:42.560 --> 08:44.080
It's the thing about the Game Man

08:44.080 --> 08:45.440
is he doesn't have a screen.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.720
So he's just telling you what your character is doing

08:48.720 --> 08:49.760
in Animal Crossing.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.840
And you can make requests.

08:51.840 --> 08:54.160
You know, it almost seems like Nintendo

08:54.160 --> 08:56.800
has just hired a fleet of men

08:56.800 --> 08:58.720
to come to my house and yell at me.

08:59.360 --> 09:01.760
And they don't come with games

09:02.400 --> 09:05.840
and they seem to just be human men

09:06.720 --> 09:08.960
who Nintendo has sent to bully me.

09:08.960 --> 09:10.560
I don't understand this.

09:10.560 --> 09:12.640
What is this business plan, Nintendo?

09:12.640 --> 09:16.640
Oh, I wish I could tell you, Chad, but I was left in disgrace

09:16.640 --> 09:18.000
from the games industry, so.

09:19.280 --> 09:21.760
You know what's so powerful about my brother,

09:21.760 --> 09:22.480
my brother and me?

09:23.280 --> 09:26.000
We can all agree that the Game Man segment

09:26.000 --> 09:27.600
was excellent and good.

09:28.720 --> 09:30.640
And in a traditional writer's room,

09:30.640 --> 09:32.160
what they would probably do is say,

09:32.160 --> 09:35.760
what's funny about E3, keep throwing things out,

09:35.760 --> 09:38.000
and then eventually hit upon the Game Man

09:38.640 --> 09:42.000
and then put that into the show that they're doing.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.760
But what's so powerful about my brother,

09:43.760 --> 09:47.920
my brother and me is we're gonna use all of it.

09:47.920 --> 09:51.040
We're gonna harness all the things we said before

09:51.040 --> 09:53.360
when we were trying to find something funny

09:53.360 --> 09:55.120
and that will still be there for you.

09:55.120 --> 09:56.880
You could see the roadmap, you know,

09:56.880 --> 09:59.600
because you see some of this stuff on TV

09:59.600 --> 10:02.160
and you think, how are they coming up with it?

10:02.160 --> 10:03.920
And on my brother, my brother and me,

10:03.920 --> 10:06.160
we have the courage to say, here's how.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.720
Guessing until we get lucky.

10:08.720 --> 10:12.240
Just kind of closing our eyes and spinning around a lot

10:12.240 --> 10:13.600
and pointing at something.

10:13.600 --> 10:14.240
Yeah.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.720
Knocking down all the vases in the room

10:16.720 --> 10:19.440
until we find one that's full of rubber chickens.

10:19.440 --> 10:19.760
Yeah.

10:20.480 --> 10:22.640
How about a regular question, though?

10:22.640 --> 10:25.360
How do I convince my boyfriend to wear shorts more often?

10:25.360 --> 10:29.120
He's got the legs and ass of a Greek god

10:29.120 --> 10:31.200
and the world needs to know.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.520
He's not self-conscious about his body.

10:33.520 --> 10:35.600
He just likes blue jeans.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.840
And that's from Gam Loving Girlfriend.

10:37.840 --> 10:40.880
What a frustration to keep those beautiful pipes

10:40.880 --> 10:42.400
under denim wrap.

10:42.960 --> 10:44.960
Yeah, if only there was some way

10:44.960 --> 10:47.680
that you could wear jeans and shorts at the same time.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.760
No, it's not that, Trav.

10:49.760 --> 10:50.560
You don't understand.

10:50.560 --> 10:52.160
Sometimes, I'm at home right now.

10:52.160 --> 10:53.200
I've been working from home all day.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.800
I could have changed into shorts at any point,

10:54.800 --> 10:58.400
but I'm wearing these denim boots because it's for me.

10:59.360 --> 11:01.760
Now, there is another compromise here

11:01.760 --> 11:03.440
and that's that you gotta get those,

11:04.400 --> 11:06.560
that George Michael jeans

11:06.560 --> 11:10.080
where it's just you can see it,

11:10.960 --> 11:14.480
all the definition of each nut.

11:14.480 --> 11:16.160
It's just right there for you.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.320
The world is yours.

11:18.320 --> 11:19.120
Do you mean, Girlfriend,

11:19.120 --> 11:20.960
because the jeans be so tight

11:20.960 --> 11:23.200
or because they be so ripped up?

11:24.400 --> 11:25.520
I think both is good.

11:25.520 --> 11:29.920
I think if you can get the rips mostly in the calf zone

11:29.920 --> 11:32.880
so that people can see a neat striation effect

11:33.520 --> 11:35.440
as if to show how old your jeans are,

11:35.440 --> 11:36.400
that can be really good.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.000
But otherwise, you just want these puppies

11:38.000 --> 11:39.040
as tight as possible.

11:39.920 --> 11:42.000
Gripping, gripping, always gripping.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.160
Well, you can also get some sliced up jeans

11:44.160 --> 11:45.840
in the butt region.

11:45.840 --> 11:47.840
So it's like, oh, is there a butt in there?

11:47.840 --> 11:48.800
Yes, there is.

11:48.800 --> 11:49.680
There is.

11:49.680 --> 11:50.960
That's confirmed.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.760
You know, maybe he's just trying to break in

11:53.760 --> 11:56.720
a new pair of shrink-to-fits

11:56.720 --> 11:58.320
and you gotta wear those.

11:58.320 --> 12:01.840
Jesse Thorn says you have to wear them for 17 years.

12:01.840 --> 12:05.280
You put your baby in a pair of tiny shrink-to-fit jeans

12:05.280 --> 12:06.960
and then you don't let them escape

12:06.960 --> 12:10.880
until they graduate high school and that's true

12:10.880 --> 12:12.000
because they grow with you.

12:12.000 --> 12:12.800
They form to your body.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.160
Jesse Thorn says that?

12:14.160 --> 12:15.680
That's what Jesse Thorn says.

12:15.680 --> 12:18.000
Jesse Thorn says that on the graduation day

12:18.640 --> 12:22.160
that they can emerge from their old dirty jeans

12:22.160 --> 12:24.320
like a chrysalis, but until then,

12:24.320 --> 12:28.960
they must grow in the same pair of jeans,

12:28.960 --> 12:30.080
same pair of shrink-to-fits.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.160
So if your boyfriend is breaking in

12:32.160 --> 12:33.440
a pair of shrink-to-fits,

12:33.440 --> 12:37.120
that is an investment that you may not appreciate now,

12:37.120 --> 12:39.920
but much like the hen saving corn

12:39.920 --> 12:42.720
as the grasshopper played in the field,

12:42.720 --> 12:44.560
once the fall comes around,

12:44.560 --> 12:49.040
you'll be so excited about these great jeans

12:49.040 --> 12:51.920
and the investment that he put into them.

12:51.920 --> 12:53.360
So at the end of that parable, Justin,

12:53.360 --> 12:55.040
is the grasshopper come around like,

12:55.040 --> 12:57.840
hey, I wanna eat some corn?

12:57.840 --> 12:59.520
I'm a grasshopper?

12:59.520 --> 13:02.240
Hey, I know I'm the world's first corn-eating grasshopper,

13:02.240 --> 13:04.160
so really the world shouldn't be surprised

13:04.160 --> 13:06.880
that I didn't save any corn because who knew?

13:06.880 --> 13:08.960
But I saw your corn and I was like,

13:08.960 --> 13:09.920
fuck, that looks good.

13:13.680 --> 13:14.880
I know it's about a hen.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.240
There's a hen in there somewhere.

13:18.240 --> 13:19.920
There's a hen in there somewhere.

13:20.480 --> 13:24.960
She asks a bunch of things to help her plant the corn

13:25.600 --> 13:28.160
and they say, maybe it's just a bunch of different animals,

13:28.160 --> 13:29.920
none of which are grasshoppers.

13:29.920 --> 13:31.200
That's possible.

13:31.200 --> 13:33.040
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking of.

13:33.040 --> 13:36.320
And all of them are wearing some really tight, sexy-ass jeans.

13:36.320 --> 13:37.360
Yeah, for sure.

13:37.360 --> 13:38.240
How about a yahoo?

13:39.520 --> 13:40.080
Yeah.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.000
This one was sent in by Fizz.

13:42.000 --> 13:42.880
Thanks, Fizz.

13:42.880 --> 13:46.640
It's anonymous yahoo answers user, so I'ma calm.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.400
I think this is the Papa John guy

13:48.400 --> 13:50.080
and this advertisement says,

13:50.080 --> 13:52.320
no, it's the coach of some sort of sports team,

13:52.320 --> 13:54.960
but he sure as hell looks like the Papa John's man anyway.

13:55.600 --> 13:56.560
Papa John asks,

13:56.560 --> 14:00.880
can the Cavs theoretically sign me to a 15-day contract

14:00.880 --> 14:03.840
if I could win them the championship against Golden State?

14:04.560 --> 14:07.360
How much maximum would I be able to earn in 15 days

14:07.360 --> 14:10.640
if I can win the title for the Cavs with my sidekick, LeBron?

14:11.600 --> 14:12.880
This is an interesting question.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.800
I don't know anything about basketball contracts

14:14.800 --> 14:16.560
or the sport at large,

14:16.560 --> 14:20.480
but would it be possible if I put up my highlight reel

14:20.480 --> 14:23.840
of dunking in six threes

14:23.840 --> 14:28.000
and then somebody at the Cleveland Cavaliers sees it

14:28.000 --> 14:31.280
and says, these are two factors,

14:31.280 --> 14:34.720
these are two things that we are deficient in

14:34.720 --> 14:36.160
is dunks and threes

14:36.720 --> 14:39.760
and then sign me for two weeks and change

14:39.760 --> 14:41.680
to get in there just as long as they're playing

14:41.680 --> 14:44.720
the Golden State Warriors and I can get in there and win

14:44.720 --> 14:46.800
and then the contract's over and I'm free.

14:46.800 --> 14:51.600
Well, Griffin, I think so because I remember not too long ago,

14:51.600 --> 14:53.920
I think it was about two months ago,

14:53.920 --> 14:56.800
when you injured your knees in that freak accident

14:56.800 --> 14:58.800
and then they healed in such a way

14:59.520 --> 15:02.320
that you could dunk like a dunking machine.

15:02.320 --> 15:03.040
Yeah.

15:03.040 --> 15:06.240
And so I could see that happening as like,

15:06.240 --> 15:09.040
maybe just one day you're at a Cavs game

15:09.040 --> 15:11.280
and somebody drops their popcorn,

15:11.280 --> 15:14.080
but whoa, you jump and you grab it

15:14.080 --> 15:15.040
and they're like, who was that?

15:15.040 --> 15:16.560
Yeah, because my flubber knees,

15:16.560 --> 15:17.840
and thank you for bringing that up, Trav,

15:17.840 --> 15:19.600
but definitely haven't brought that up before

15:19.600 --> 15:21.680
because I wasn't trying to keep it private or anything,

15:21.680 --> 15:23.040
but yeah, I guess let's talk about it.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.120
Yeah, I got hit by two different cars at the same time.

15:25.120 --> 15:26.160
You had one for each knee.

15:26.160 --> 15:27.200
So thanks, Trav.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.640
Well, edit it back so it sounds like

15:28.640 --> 15:29.760
I'm talking about someone else.

15:29.760 --> 15:30.880
Probably wondering how that happened.

15:30.880 --> 15:32.800
It was during a drag race, of course.

15:32.800 --> 15:33.920
Thank you, Travis.

15:33.920 --> 15:34.400
I'm sorry, Griffin.

15:34.400 --> 15:37.680
Travis was alluding to the hit teen comedy

15:37.680 --> 15:38.640
Rookie of the Year.

15:38.640 --> 15:39.600
Oh, was I?

15:39.600 --> 15:40.560
Funky but loving.

15:40.560 --> 15:45.200
When he injured, the kid injures his arm in such a way

15:45.200 --> 15:46.880
that makes him great at pitching.

15:46.880 --> 15:51.760
That's, of course, possible and ludicrous at the same time,

15:51.760 --> 15:56.480
but they never explore the extension of that reality

15:56.480 --> 16:02.240
in that fiction that I want to see the pro baseball players

16:02.240 --> 16:06.240
lining up to attempt to give themselves the same injury

16:06.240 --> 16:07.680
that this child withstood.

16:07.680 --> 16:08.480
Yeah.

16:08.480 --> 16:10.960
Like purposely going into the doctor

16:10.960 --> 16:17.120
and having them jam various shivs and what have you

16:17.120 --> 16:19.600
into their musculature to try to reenact

16:19.600 --> 16:20.880
this terrible accident.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.720
That would be ghoulish, but I think

16:22.720 --> 16:24.160
it'd be worth it for the Blu-ray.

16:24.160 --> 16:26.480
Also, could we just for a little bit,

16:26.480 --> 16:30.160
I would like one scene edited in for the 25th anniversary

16:30.160 --> 16:32.160
Blu-ray edition of Rookie of the Year

16:32.160 --> 16:35.360
that's just Major League Baseball's lawyers being like,

16:35.360 --> 16:40.560
well, this child is 15, so we probably can't let him

16:40.560 --> 16:43.760
legally work for us, right?

16:43.760 --> 16:46.160
There's laws against this, is there not?

16:46.160 --> 16:48.080
I want the scene where the kid's arm heals

16:48.080 --> 16:50.160
and he's like, oh, man, I really liked

16:50.160 --> 16:51.520
having that cool pitching arm.

16:51.520 --> 16:53.040
I wonder what other parts of my body

16:53.040 --> 16:55.120
I can sort of modify like that.

16:55.120 --> 16:57.600
And he just whams himself right in the goners

16:57.600 --> 17:00.160
with a big meat tenderizer, just thinking like,

17:00.160 --> 17:02.960
maybe more powerful balls, I guess.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.320
No, that one didn't work.

17:06.320 --> 17:08.000
Hey, mom, hospital again.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.640
Hospital, call an Uber.

17:10.640 --> 17:14.000
What do you think Rowan Gardner goes on?

17:14.000 --> 17:14.800
Yeah, what's up?

17:14.800 --> 17:15.920
That was a deep pull.

17:15.920 --> 17:18.720
Goes on to like, what's he do?

17:18.720 --> 17:22.240
After he lands again, he does an underhanded pitch

17:22.240 --> 17:24.320
in the MLB and he wins the big game.

17:24.320 --> 17:26.320
Spoiler alert for Rookie of the Year.

17:26.320 --> 17:28.480
What does he do with the rest of his life?

17:28.480 --> 17:30.320
Let's write some fan fiction.

17:30.320 --> 17:32.240
Probably tours around malls, right?

17:32.240 --> 17:33.600
He signs things in malls.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.920
Noah goes from school to school showing kids

17:35.920 --> 17:38.960
that drugs are bad by throwing a baseball weird and fast.

17:38.960 --> 17:40.960
Yeah, drugs are bad, but it's okay to like,

17:40.960 --> 17:42.880
injure yourself to be better at sports.

17:42.880 --> 17:44.480
Oh, I have breaking news.

17:45.120 --> 17:48.480
The film of Rookie of the Year is based on

17:48.480 --> 17:54.960
a 1954 American comedy, the name of which is Ruggies Bump.

17:54.960 --> 17:56.320
What?

17:56.320 --> 17:58.800
Sorry, Justin, neither of the words you just said were words.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.640
Can you take another swing at it?

18:00.640 --> 18:02.400
Ruggies Bump.

18:02.400 --> 18:05.040
It still sounds like you're saying Rookie.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.880
Like noogie, but with an R?

18:06.880 --> 18:10.080
My friends, the film is called Ruggies Bump.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.000
Ruggies Bump.

18:12.640 --> 18:16.240
According to the poster, Rookie is the miracle kid

18:16.240 --> 18:17.760
with the super zoom ball.

18:18.480 --> 18:21.120
And the name of the film is Ruggies Bump.

18:21.120 --> 18:22.160
It is Rookie.

18:22.720 --> 18:23.600
It's Rookie.

18:24.160 --> 18:25.760
Rookie, not rookie.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.440
Rookie.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.120
And I don't know why.

18:29.120 --> 18:32.160
And this is the kid with the super zoom ball, right?

18:32.160 --> 18:34.240
This is the one with the super zoom ball.

18:34.240 --> 18:35.760
They call him Rookie.

18:35.760 --> 18:38.640
On the poster, does it say written by cocaine?

18:40.320 --> 18:47.840
Plot is a young boy who loves baseball develops a strange bump on his arm.

18:47.840 --> 18:48.160
Wait.

18:49.760 --> 18:50.320
Rookie.

18:51.520 --> 18:55.680
Rookie's got a strange bump on his arm and it gives him the super zoom ball.

18:55.680 --> 18:58.640
The bump has such an effect on his pitching arm

18:58.640 --> 19:02.640
that he soon finds himself playing for a major league baseball team.

19:02.640 --> 19:07.120
As stupid as the he fell and broke his arm

19:07.120 --> 19:09.280
and the tendons rehealed too tight is,

19:09.280 --> 19:13.760
it's got to be better than my tumor that makes me good at pitching.

19:13.760 --> 19:15.840
A strange bump.

19:15.840 --> 19:16.960
My strange bump.

19:17.600 --> 19:18.080
One question.

19:18.080 --> 19:19.760
Rookie's bump, I call it.

19:19.760 --> 19:20.960
That's right, Rookie.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.400
Oh my God, it's talking.

19:22.400 --> 19:23.360
That was my question.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.480
It definitely talks, right?

19:24.480 --> 19:26.720
And was voiced by like Jimmy Stewart or something.

19:26.720 --> 19:27.520
Had to talk.

19:27.520 --> 19:30.800
I'm looking at one of the variations of the poster for it

19:30.800 --> 19:34.880
and it's Rookie's bump featuring the Brooklyn Dodgers.

19:34.880 --> 19:37.360
So that's a pretty cool year for the Brooklyn Dodgers.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.920
And a good year for the movie

19:39.920 --> 19:43.520
when you have to advertise the fact that you tricked a baseball team to being in it.

19:45.520 --> 19:47.440
That was the least we've ever answered a question.

19:47.440 --> 19:48.240
Let's move on.

19:48.240 --> 19:51.520
I can't stop thinking about the phrase Rookie's bump.

19:51.520 --> 19:53.200
Rookie's bump is my movie.

19:53.200 --> 19:55.920
I'm sorry, sir, but the outlet doesn't look good.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.880
It seems that you have Rookie's bump.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.000
Not Rugal's bump.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.040
How long do I have?

20:01.040 --> 20:05.280
Like three weeks, but they're going to be three really fun major league weeks.

20:06.800 --> 20:09.280
I want to do a sequel to Rookie's bump

20:09.280 --> 20:12.800
and it's the same thing, but the kid hates baseball

20:12.800 --> 20:13.840
and he doesn't want to.

20:13.840 --> 20:15.280
I don't want to do that, doctor.

20:15.280 --> 20:18.000
Well, could you just cure my strange bump?

20:18.000 --> 20:19.680
Could you just cure my strange bump?

20:19.680 --> 20:22.080
I could destroy a beautiful bump like that.

20:22.800 --> 20:23.920
Put my t-shirts fit.

20:24.480 --> 20:27.760
I'm a junior in college living in a student apartment complex.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.000
One of my roommates asked me to watch his plants farm

20:30.000 --> 20:31.440
while he's in Europe for the summer.

20:31.440 --> 20:32.480
And I said yes.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.160
So now I'm alone in my apartment

20:34.160 --> 20:36.720
babysitting an ironing board covered in plants.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.160
My question is this.

20:38.160 --> 20:41.840
My plant owning roommate left a gallon jug of artisanal water

20:41.840 --> 20:44.240
from some fancy well next to the plants.

20:44.240 --> 20:46.400
It looks expensive and it's almost empty.

20:46.400 --> 20:49.280
Do I have to buy more expensive artisanal water?

20:50.160 --> 20:51.840
Can I just water them with tap water?

20:52.480 --> 20:53.920
Will the plants tell on me?

20:53.920 --> 20:57.280
And that's from Confused Plant Sitter in Colorado.

20:58.320 --> 21:00.320
I mean, they'll tell on you by dying

21:00.320 --> 21:02.640
because they're not getting their special water.

21:02.640 --> 21:03.760
Their special water.

21:04.400 --> 21:05.600
Their secret stuff.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.600
Their secret plant stuff.

21:08.160 --> 21:10.720
It is Michael Jordan's sweat, definitely.

21:10.720 --> 21:12.400
That's what they drank in Space Jam, right?

21:12.400 --> 21:13.680
I haven't seen it in a long time.

21:13.680 --> 21:15.200
When they say Michael's secret stuff,

21:15.200 --> 21:16.400
they're talking about his-

21:16.400 --> 21:17.360
Michael's piss.

21:17.360 --> 21:18.480
His fluids.

21:18.480 --> 21:19.280
Thank you, Travis.

21:19.280 --> 21:20.080
Thank you.

21:20.080 --> 21:24.240
Yeah, no, Daffy Duck's spraying happily Michael MJ's piss.

21:24.240 --> 21:26.880
Thank you, Travis, for thinking of Porky Pig

21:26.880 --> 21:29.440
and all of his friends just spraying MJ's piss

21:29.440 --> 21:31.680
right into the gob to be good at basketball.

21:31.680 --> 21:32.000
Thank you, Travis.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.080
What's up with that Space Jam 2?

21:34.080 --> 21:34.640
Yeah, come on.

21:34.640 --> 21:35.520
Where's that?

21:35.520 --> 21:37.600
Water has the following in it.

21:37.600 --> 21:40.480
A little bit of hydrogen, twice as much oxygen,

21:40.480 --> 21:41.840
or perhaps flip that.

21:43.200 --> 21:46.080
I don't think there's anything else in this stuff, right?

21:46.080 --> 21:49.440
Like the water, it comes off the most beautiful glacier

21:49.440 --> 21:52.720
and the stuff that comes out of my street tap

21:53.280 --> 21:55.360
is just water, right?

21:55.360 --> 21:56.880
It's the same chemicals.

21:56.880 --> 21:59.600
So who cares, man?

21:59.600 --> 22:02.720
Well, the plants care because they need their special-

22:02.720 --> 22:03.040
Yeah.

22:04.000 --> 22:04.880
Minerals.

22:04.880 --> 22:06.320
Their special minerals.

22:06.320 --> 22:08.160
Special minerals.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.680
They need their minerals.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.000
What kinds of things do plants need?

22:12.000 --> 22:15.360
Let's just go back and forth listing some of the most

22:15.360 --> 22:17.760
important things that plants need in their water.

22:17.760 --> 22:18.160
Trav?

22:18.160 --> 22:19.520
Have compassion.

22:20.160 --> 22:20.640
Kisses.

22:21.520 --> 22:22.160
Okay.

22:22.160 --> 22:23.920
Plants need kisses, he says.

22:23.920 --> 22:24.240
Yeah.

22:24.800 --> 22:27.920
And they need money.

22:27.920 --> 22:29.120
Plants need your money.

22:29.120 --> 22:31.680
I mean, for me, it's always been water, sunshine,

22:31.680 --> 22:33.280
and for bees to have sex on them.

22:35.200 --> 22:36.720
Is that what that's about?

22:36.720 --> 22:38.960
Is that why we're so concerned about the bees?

22:38.960 --> 22:41.280
Yeah, we need them to get nasty in all our beautiful plants

22:41.280 --> 22:44.160
or else all the corn and blueberries are denzo.

22:44.160 --> 22:47.120
I don't understand giving plants more than they need to live.

22:47.120 --> 22:52.160
I don't believe that there are certain waters that's better for plants

22:52.160 --> 22:55.040
because they're getting the dirty water from the sky, right?

22:55.040 --> 22:59.760
Like, many plants are doing just fine with our shitty, dirty water.

22:59.760 --> 23:00.000
Yeah.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.520
So why do they need special-

23:01.520 --> 23:04.000
I don't believe that these plants need special water.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.360
How do you even know how much?

23:05.360 --> 23:09.200
I bought my wife a plant from Mother's Day and then I hung it outside

23:09.200 --> 23:11.920
and then I gave it various amounts of water,

23:11.920 --> 23:14.400
just hoping that I would stumble on the right combination

23:14.400 --> 23:15.440
that would keep it alive.

23:15.440 --> 23:16.800
I was not successful.

23:16.800 --> 23:19.200
But how do you even know how much water to give the things?

23:19.200 --> 23:22.320
I do also- I love J-Man because I feel the same way

23:22.320 --> 23:25.520
that if I have a plant in my house, it is not about

23:25.520 --> 23:28.080
I hope I can help this plant flourish,

23:28.080 --> 23:32.080
but rather I just hope I can beat the clock on plant death.

23:32.080 --> 23:35.520
Like, I'm not trying to have the world's best fern.

23:35.520 --> 23:38.480
I merely want it to last longer than six months

23:38.480 --> 23:40.080
and that's a big old W for me.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.840
That's why I like pro-flowers.

23:41.840 --> 23:43.200
That ship has sailed.

23:43.200 --> 23:46.400
It's not about keep this alive, it's like preserve this corpse.

23:46.400 --> 23:48.160
And be, you know what I mean?

23:48.160 --> 23:49.600
There's no pressure there.

23:49.600 --> 23:53.360
I'm a mortuary, not a hospital.

23:53.360 --> 23:56.000
And also, what do you do if you have to iron clothes?

23:56.000 --> 23:57.600
Oh my shit, Justin, you're right.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.120
Yeah, I just didn't even think about that.

23:59.120 --> 23:59.680
Yeah.

23:59.680 --> 24:02.400
Can't possibly move these precious spoiled plants.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.800
These pampered plants.

24:04.800 --> 24:05.520
Maybe that's it.

24:05.520 --> 24:07.120
Maybe you need to toughen these plants up

24:07.120 --> 24:08.960
and take it on like a survival weekend.

24:08.960 --> 24:10.560
Take the plants on a road trip.

24:10.560 --> 24:12.160
You and your friend, Jack Black,

24:12.160 --> 24:15.840
in the front seat, these plants in the back seat.

24:15.840 --> 24:18.240
A wild sort of road trip.

24:18.240 --> 24:20.080
Yeah, you're trying to keep these plants alive,

24:20.080 --> 24:21.680
but have they ever really lived?

24:21.680 --> 24:23.600
Yeah, they're gonna be uncomfortable about it at first.

24:23.600 --> 24:25.840
They're gonna be like, ugh, are you sure about this?

24:25.840 --> 24:28.000
And then some bees are gonna start having sex on them

24:28.000 --> 24:30.400
and they're like, well, this is how it's supposed to be.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.240
And then it turns out, oh no, it's weed

24:32.240 --> 24:33.360
and you've been pulled over.

24:33.920 --> 24:34.480
Oh shit.

24:34.480 --> 24:36.800
Oh, has it been weed the whole time?

24:36.800 --> 24:40.080
I think it's been, oh no, it's been weed the whole time.

24:40.080 --> 24:42.000
Have the plants been weed the whole time?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.480
Because your friend is no friend of yours.

24:44.480 --> 24:46.240
It's a friend of Cheech Marin.

24:46.240 --> 24:49.040
That's what I talk about with stoners.

24:49.040 --> 24:50.880
I was playing some Destiny earlier today

24:50.880 --> 24:52.960
and I was playing with some randos online.

24:52.960 --> 24:56.640
Gang, I heard somebody take the longest bong rip I ever heard.

24:56.640 --> 24:58.160
I thought they were pulling a prank on me.

24:58.160 --> 25:02.800
It was literally a good, probably 45 seconds.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.560
Not a joke, not an exaggeration.

25:04.560 --> 25:06.400
A good like, hey, hold on everybody.

25:06.400 --> 25:07.440
Don't start it up yet.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.680
Go ahead and kill all the stuff in the room

25:09.680 --> 25:10.720
and I'll be ready for the boss.

25:10.720 --> 25:15.760
Here we go, like 45 seconds.

25:15.760 --> 25:18.480
I felt like I was like going up a hill on a roller coaster

25:18.480 --> 25:19.600
made of a bong.

25:19.600 --> 25:20.320
That was nothing.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.520
I was sitting here trying to formulate

25:25.520 --> 25:27.920
a rookie of the year version joke of like,

25:27.920 --> 25:31.040
maybe this person had asthma, damaged their lungs

25:31.040 --> 25:33.760
and now they're able to take these ridiculous rips.

25:33.760 --> 25:35.040
I couldn't get there.

25:35.680 --> 25:37.280
The doctor said the only treatment

25:37.280 --> 25:43.200
for my rookie's bump is giant bong rips.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.040
It's just juicy rips.

25:45.040 --> 25:46.240
Hey, I got a quick Yahoo here.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.760
This one was sent in by Erica Batty.

25:47.760 --> 25:48.480
Thank you, Erica.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.720
It's Yahoo Answers user question mark who asks,

25:52.320 --> 25:56.800
if you die hungry, is your ghost hungry forever?

25:57.520 --> 25:59.760
Please don't answer this with ghosts aren't real.

25:59.760 --> 26:01.200
I know there's no physical proof,

26:01.200 --> 26:03.200
but I'm erring on the side of caution.

26:03.200 --> 26:05.600
Always so smart when you're talking about the supernatural.

26:05.600 --> 26:09.040
You're driving down the road heading to Hardee's

26:09.040 --> 26:11.760
and you've got a hearty hunger and you're growing in your belly

26:11.760 --> 26:16.800
and you got to get there soon because you're not you

26:16.800 --> 26:20.800
and you're hungry and you do a quick like cool hairpin turn

26:20.800 --> 26:24.640
into the Hardee's drive through and you flip the car, explode.

26:25.360 --> 26:28.480
Yeah, and you've died hungry and there's your ghost.

26:28.480 --> 26:30.640
It can never enter the Hardee's and even if it could

26:30.640 --> 26:32.640
and couldn't eat the tangible burgers,

26:32.640 --> 26:34.400
is your ghost hungry forever?

26:34.400 --> 26:35.360
Hungry forever.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.600
I'm just going to go ahead and mention

26:37.600 --> 26:39.840
that in Hello from the Magic Tavern,

26:39.840 --> 26:42.240
they do discuss the hunger ghost, so it's okay.

26:42.240 --> 26:44.000
You don't need to tweet at us about that.

26:44.000 --> 26:44.800
You have a ghost.

26:44.800 --> 26:46.800
It's never sated, right?

26:47.360 --> 26:51.040
We have a finite number of resources on this planet,

26:51.040 --> 26:52.960
a finite amount of resources on this planet.

26:52.960 --> 26:57.280
This ghost could eat their way through our food supply

26:58.400 --> 27:02.640
and really put our whole ecosystem in something of a bind

27:02.640 --> 27:05.840
because the ghost could just single-handedly eat up

27:05.840 --> 27:08.480
all our dang hot dogs and all of our good stuff.

27:08.480 --> 27:10.160
The ghost could just chomp it all down.

27:10.160 --> 27:12.160
Now here's my question, J-Man.

27:12.160 --> 27:15.440
When I eat a sandwich, does that create a ghost sandwich?

27:16.080 --> 27:17.520
We've definitely talked about this before.

27:18.480 --> 27:19.920
What does that say about us?

27:19.920 --> 27:21.280
I know, it's a bummer.

27:21.280 --> 27:22.800
What does that say about us?

27:22.800 --> 27:24.080
No, it's rough, but listen,

27:24.080 --> 27:27.760
does this carry over to all known desires?

27:27.760 --> 27:30.400
If I really want to listen to Dave Matthews' band,

27:30.400 --> 27:32.000
but first I'm going to use the toilet

27:32.000 --> 27:33.520
and I definitely die on it,

27:34.400 --> 27:36.960
then am I always going to be floating around Spectral World

27:36.960 --> 27:39.360
just like, damn, I'd love to hear Ian's marching right now,

27:39.360 --> 27:43.280
but my wife is too sad to turn on his feel-good tunes.

27:45.200 --> 27:49.120
I think that the worst sensation to die with

27:49.120 --> 27:50.800
and have forever is being afraid.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.400
Like if you die of fright

27:52.400 --> 27:54.800
and then you're just a scared ghost forever

27:54.800 --> 28:00.640
because what are you going to do as a ghost to not be scared?

28:00.640 --> 28:01.680
Maybe sleepy.

28:01.680 --> 28:02.720
Sleepy's also bad.

28:03.440 --> 28:04.560
Sleepy ghost would be all right

28:04.560 --> 28:06.000
because what else are you going to do?

28:06.000 --> 28:06.480
That's fair.

28:06.480 --> 28:09.040
What if I have to go to the bathroom ghost?

28:09.040 --> 28:12.160
That's no good because then you can never...

28:12.160 --> 28:13.440
See, yours is so bad.

28:13.440 --> 28:14.480
Mine was pretty good.

28:14.480 --> 28:16.320
If you're a sleepy ghost, then it's like,

28:16.320 --> 28:18.800
well, I'm in this big spooky mansion.

28:19.440 --> 28:23.520
I've read all the books by floating through them as I do

28:24.160 --> 28:25.120
and I don't have anything to do,

28:25.120 --> 28:26.720
but I'm always really sleepy,

28:26.720 --> 28:28.880
so I'm just going to sack out for a few hundred years.

28:28.880 --> 28:30.720
Maybe some neighborhood kids will wander in here.

28:30.720 --> 28:32.240
I'll give them a little spookeroonie.

28:32.240 --> 28:35.600
Get out and turn the light off on your way.

28:37.120 --> 28:37.840
Please.

28:37.840 --> 28:40.480
Maybe crank down that AC a couple degrees

28:40.480 --> 28:43.280
and turn on the fan in the bedroom.

28:43.280 --> 28:47.760
Give me some white noise.

28:47.760 --> 28:48.320
The horny.

28:50.480 --> 28:55.440
I feel like horny ghost is a phrase my mouth has said before

28:55.440 --> 28:59.520
and I can't think of a reason it would happen other than this show.

28:59.520 --> 29:02.080
Should we put an embargo on ghost jokes then?

29:02.080 --> 29:05.600
Well, you might need a moratorium if you will.

29:05.600 --> 29:07.840
So now that we know that this is the last ghost bit,

29:07.840 --> 29:10.800
let's talk about some of our favorite ghostly memories

29:10.800 --> 29:12.000
here on My Brother, My Brother and Me.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.720
Some of our favorite ghost humor we've ever done.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.640
Wow, I can't think of one good one.

29:20.640 --> 29:31.680
So maybe let's go to the money zone.

29:35.680 --> 29:39.360
Folks, our first sponsor this week is Bowl and Branch.

29:39.360 --> 29:42.240
Don't you get excited when you know you get to slip in

29:42.240 --> 29:45.760
to your spectral sheets and give yourself a nice ghostly nap.

29:45.760 --> 29:48.240
If you're a ghost that's going to sleep for 100 years,

29:48.240 --> 29:53.120
you should do it on the best sheets available from Bowl and Branch.

29:53.120 --> 29:57.520
And they're made from pure 100% organic cotton.

29:57.520 --> 30:00.400
They start out super soft and you know where they go from there?

30:00.400 --> 30:01.600
Did you guess less soft?

30:01.600 --> 30:04.480
You're incorrect because they get softer over time.

30:05.040 --> 30:06.240
Lots of great reviews.

30:06.240 --> 30:07.440
Shipping is free.

30:07.440 --> 30:10.080
You could try them for 30 nights and if you don't love them,

30:10.080 --> 30:12.560
send them back for a refund.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.400
I also want to say, not just sheets,

30:14.400 --> 30:16.880
I've got a set of towels from Bowl and Branch.

30:16.880 --> 30:18.000
Oh yeah.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.200
And I've had them now for like, you know, almost a year,

30:21.200 --> 30:24.560
maybe over a year and unlike some towels I've had,

30:24.560 --> 30:28.160
the more I wash them, like they stay consistently

30:28.160 --> 30:31.360
that like soft fluffy new towel kind of feeling.

30:31.360 --> 30:32.240
Love that, need that.

30:32.240 --> 30:33.200
Love these towels.

Hey, Stitch Fix.

30:53.280 --> 30:54.080
Yeah?

30:54.080 --> 30:54.960
How's it going, pal?

30:55.520 --> 30:57.200
I'm going to talk about you for a minute.

30:57.200 --> 30:59.840
Hey, Stitch Fix though, just thanks.

31:01.520 --> 31:04.000
Kind of don't love you being here in the room while I do it.

31:04.000 --> 31:04.880
I kind of need my space.

31:04.880 --> 31:05.760
No, go ahead.

31:05.760 --> 31:06.960
I like to watch.

31:07.680 --> 31:08.560
Oh no.

31:08.560 --> 31:11.120
Here's your $200.

31:11.120 --> 31:12.000
Go ahead.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.600
Talk about the service.

31:15.600 --> 31:15.920
All right.

31:16.480 --> 31:17.840
They send you a-

31:17.840 --> 31:18.720
Just let me know if I can-

31:18.720 --> 31:19.200
Slower.

31:22.320 --> 31:22.640
All right.

31:23.840 --> 31:26.400
So just because a sense of style can be elusive for some

31:26.400 --> 31:28.400
doesn't mean it's impossible to attain.

31:28.400 --> 31:31.440
Discover the style you never knew you had with a little help from Stitch.

31:31.440 --> 31:32.720
Sorry, can you put your shirt back on?

31:33.840 --> 31:38.720
Just, yeah, but I just got five new ones in a box from myself.

31:38.720 --> 31:41.280
So I'm going to change into one of these new looks,

31:41.280 --> 31:43.120
and I'd like you to give me your feedback.

31:43.600 --> 31:44.240
All right, go ahead.

31:45.120 --> 31:46.400
Yeah, they're all really good.

31:46.400 --> 31:48.880
I mean, you bought them for yourself, so it's not like-

31:48.880 --> 31:50.320
Well, I didn't actually.

31:50.320 --> 31:54.400
I had one of the people that work inside of me choose them.

31:54.400 --> 31:59.840
They got my favorite, I told them my favorite styles and my budget,

31:59.840 --> 32:05.280
and they selected five brand new clothing, I guess, just for me.

32:05.280 --> 32:08.480
No, I can see them rattling around inside of you when I'm not here.

32:08.480 --> 32:09.200
Whenever you move.

32:09.200 --> 32:10.560
You're huge, by the way.

32:11.600 --> 32:14.560
So anyway, what you do is you answer some questions about your sizes,

32:14.560 --> 32:15.680
favorite styles and budget,

32:15.680 --> 32:20.400
and your personal stylist will hand-select five brand new clothing items just for you.

32:20.400 --> 32:23.360
You send back anything you don't want, and shipping's free both ways,

32:23.360 --> 32:25.840
so you only pay for what you keep.

32:25.840 --> 32:27.680
My size is extra.

32:28.320 --> 32:28.800
What's that?

32:29.840 --> 32:31.040
Extra.

32:31.040 --> 32:32.240
You just are extra?

32:33.360 --> 32:34.880
Yes, extra me.

32:34.880 --> 32:38.320
So you can get your fix whenever you want, regardless of which size you wear,

32:38.320 --> 32:40.720
even if that size is company.

32:41.280 --> 32:44.000
Or you can sign up to receive scheduled shipments.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.960
Hurry to stitchfix.com slash my brother to get started now.

32:46.960 --> 32:50.640
Keep all five items you receive, and you'll get 25% off your entire purchase.

32:50.640 --> 32:52.720
Go to stitchfix.com.

32:53.600 --> 32:54.080
What?

32:54.080 --> 32:55.920
I didn't approve that.

32:55.920 --> 32:58.800
That's just too great of a deal.

32:58.800 --> 33:02.080
I'm gonna go broke with that kind of a deal.

33:02.080 --> 33:05.840
Well, you want me to holler around inside of you and see if I can find the culprit?

33:06.400 --> 33:10.400
Yes, look, check my armpit for Jerry.

33:10.400 --> 33:17.520
He's a new guy, and I think he's the kind of nincompoop that would have a dumb idea

33:17.520 --> 33:26.640
like going to stitchfix.com slash my brother and keep 25% off when you keep all five items.

33:26.640 --> 33:29.840
That sounds like a Jerry original.

33:30.640 --> 33:31.040
Okay.

33:31.040 --> 33:33.920
Trav, you want to read this next message?

33:33.920 --> 33:35.040
I sure do, Griffin.

33:35.040 --> 33:35.840
Thank you for asking.

33:35.840 --> 33:39.920
Are you getting married and you want a beautiful memory to last a lifetime?

33:39.920 --> 33:42.800
Find a woman that could satisfy me.

33:42.800 --> 33:43.760
Stitch Fix.

33:43.760 --> 33:44.720
Oh, goodness.

33:45.360 --> 33:46.960
Oh, I thought he'd be gone.

33:47.600 --> 33:49.760
Hey, Stitch Fix, listen.

33:49.760 --> 33:52.720
I swear, I've seen Blue Apron eyeing you from the other side of the room.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.520
Yes, this will do.

33:56.400 --> 33:57.440
Okay, now that we've-

33:57.440 --> 34:00.880
I need someone with access to plentiful scallions.

34:00.880 --> 34:05.200
Yes, so now that we've got two companies get married, Travis, maybe start this message

34:05.200 --> 34:08.800
from a different sort of corporate sponsor going.

34:10.800 --> 34:14.560
Are you getting married and want a beautiful memory to last a lifetime?

34:14.560 --> 34:18.880
Are you also huge geeks and don't want to be judged for cutting your cake with a replica

34:18.880 --> 34:19.920
of Sting?

34:19.920 --> 34:20.720
Then have-

34:20.720 --> 34:21.920
Wait, the artist?

34:21.920 --> 34:24.080
Don't cut your cake with me.

34:26.480 --> 34:27.280
That was stupid.

34:27.280 --> 34:30.480
Then we got the videographer for you.

34:31.040 --> 34:36.320
David Trothright will film your wedding and make it look as epic as you always knew it

34:36.320 --> 34:37.040
could be.

34:37.040 --> 34:46.800

35:09.120 --> 35:13.520

35:13.520 --> 35:14.320
Thank you.

35:14.320 --> 35:17.600
For all your geek wedding videography needs.

35:17.600 --> 35:22.560
I have a message for Eli, and it's from Reina, and it goes a little something like this.

35:22.560 --> 35:25.840
To my very good big brother Eli, surprise.

35:25.840 --> 35:29.040
I honestly don't even have anything important to say here.

35:29.040 --> 35:34.640
I had an extra hundo lying around and just thought it'd be cool to sneak this up on you.

35:34.640 --> 35:38.640
Now, listen to one of the Mackle boys say these funny words.

35:39.600 --> 35:40.880
Bumfuzzle.

35:40.880 --> 35:42.000
Oh, Justin, I'm so sorry, dude.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.280
Caddywampus.

35:43.280 --> 35:45.840
I'm so sorry you lost the luck of the draw here, pal.

35:45.840 --> 35:48.560
Boopers, I deserved it for the Stitch Fix thing.

35:48.560 --> 35:50.240
I mean, I lost us a sponsor.

35:50.240 --> 35:54.080
The least I can do is earn us a hundred bucks.

35:54.640 --> 35:55.600
That's all, I guess.

35:56.160 --> 35:57.040
Thanks, boys.

35:57.040 --> 35:58.240
Love you lots.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.920
And that's from Eli, from Reina.

36:02.480 --> 36:04.400
You kind of messed up this attribution there.

36:04.400 --> 36:08.160
That one is from Reina to Eli.

36:08.160 --> 36:09.040
Good job.

36:09.040 --> 36:14.480
Here's a message for Angela, and it's from Scott, who says, dearest Angela, you are the

36:14.480 --> 36:18.640
most important person of all time, and you are taking the world by storm.

36:20.080 --> 36:27.520
Chumbo and Numbo, my favorite Pawn Stars characters, now bow before your glowing righteousness.

36:27.520 --> 36:32.640
You are vibing and keeping it tight in ways that other humans cannot begin to fathom.

36:32.640 --> 36:33.920
Your power is endless.

36:33.920 --> 36:35.280
You are a new god.

36:35.280 --> 36:38.640
The earth trembles before you today, the day of your birth.

36:38.640 --> 36:39.840
Sweet Jesus.

36:39.840 --> 36:44.080
Are we supposed to be as scared of Angela as I am in this moment?

36:44.880 --> 36:47.040
I think Angela is powerful and radical.

36:47.840 --> 36:49.120
I am trembling.

36:49.120 --> 36:50.480
Yeah, I'm really glad we got to share.

36:50.480 --> 36:54.240
Oh, no, she just stepped on my house with her huge foot.

36:54.240 --> 36:55.680
Yeah, she's big, powerful.

36:55.680 --> 36:56.320
Too bad.

36:56.800 --> 37:00.000
Hey, this is John Roderick of America.

37:00.000 --> 37:00.960
I know that guy.

37:00.960 --> 37:04.000
He also made the theme song for my brother, My Brother and Me.

37:04.000 --> 37:09.040
And you've teamed up with your friend, Adam, and a guy you also know, Ben Harrison.

37:09.040 --> 37:11.120
Hey, you're my friend.

37:11.120 --> 37:14.480
And we make a war movie podcast called Friendly Fire.

37:14.480 --> 37:20.800
Now, you may be turned off by the premise right then and there, but you would be wrong.

37:20.800 --> 37:24.880
Well, it's because it's about so much more than war or war films.

37:24.880 --> 37:31.840
War movies are also a great window into filmmaking and the way our culture thinks of itself and

37:31.840 --> 37:34.400
other cultures think of themselves.

37:34.400 --> 37:42.320
So listen to Friendly Fire on MaximumFun.org every Friday, or get it wherever you get podcasts.

37:46.320 --> 37:47.040
Oh, thank god.

37:49.280 --> 37:49.780
What?

37:56.960 --> 37:57.920
We got a new fuzz box.

37:57.920 --> 37:59.120
Is this Diamond Dave?

37:59.120 --> 37:59.840
What's going on?

38:01.600 --> 38:02.560
Oh, Jesus.

38:02.560 --> 38:04.400
His guitar got very sick.

38:07.120 --> 38:07.620
Okay, so-

38:07.620 --> 38:09.920
I want a Munch Squad.

38:11.920 --> 38:14.800
I want too much squad.

38:14.800 --> 38:18.320
Juicy, you need to get down to Guitar Center, bud, and get that shit looked at.

38:18.320 --> 38:20.000
I gotta get this thing in the shop.

38:20.000 --> 38:26.480
I've been having to do a lot of Munch Squads lately where the copy is the star of the show

38:26.480 --> 38:31.040
because the products haven't been as really buck wild as we need to get on a Munch Squad,

38:31.040 --> 38:35.760
a podcast within a podcast, profiling the latest and greatest in the quick service restaurant

38:35.760 --> 38:36.320
industry.

38:36.320 --> 38:39.360
But I want to say thank you, fuzzolies.

38:39.360 --> 38:48.160
As I've said no times on the toilet, thank you, fuzzolies, for bringing the heat with

38:48.160 --> 38:50.160
the new breadstick sliders.

38:51.200 --> 38:54.720
Now, if you're in the Indianapolis area, you may have seen these spring up here at the

38:54.720 --> 39:00.720
test market for these bad boys, and they're just as terrifying as they sound.

39:00.720 --> 39:05.600
You know the fuzzolies breadsticks that they used to bring you infinite of if you were

39:05.600 --> 39:09.440
seated at the table, but now don't do that anymore, I don't think.

39:10.160 --> 39:12.080
The breadsticks, the very-

39:12.080 --> 39:17.680
You know the super sloppy ones that seem like eating even one is a dare kind of scenario?

39:17.680 --> 39:18.400
You know what I mean?

39:18.400 --> 39:20.800
Yeah, these little salty little missiles.

39:20.800 --> 39:24.720
Yeah, so what they've done is they've cut one of those motherfuckers in half and stuffed

39:24.720 --> 39:26.160
a bunch of pepperoni in there.

39:26.160 --> 39:30.640
They're perfect as a, it says here, shareable snack.

39:30.640 --> 39:33.040
Now let's not think about, let's think about that for a second.

39:33.680 --> 39:39.200
A shareable snack doesn't seem like one thing should be a shareable snack.

39:39.200 --> 39:44.000
Like if you come to me and you say, I've been snacking on this breadstick full of pepperoni,

39:44.000 --> 39:45.840
would you like to share it with me?

39:45.840 --> 39:49.360
I think the answer would almost always be no, thank you very much.

39:50.160 --> 39:52.400
Perfect as a shareable snack throughout the day.

39:52.400 --> 39:53.680
What?

39:53.680 --> 39:57.360
I know they don't mean that like it sounds.

39:57.360 --> 40:01.440
I know they don't mean like, oh, I'm gonna put the rest of you in the Ziploc baggy.

40:01.440 --> 40:02.800
See you at 3 p.m.

40:02.800 --> 40:03.760
It sounds almost like-

40:03.760 --> 40:05.200
One third of a breadstick slider.

40:05.200 --> 40:10.080
Because you talk to your friend and you say you got anything going on from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

40:10.080 --> 40:12.560
Because we're gonna eat these all day as science.

40:12.560 --> 40:14.000
These are an all days thing.

40:14.000 --> 40:20.080
The revolutionary new ways to indulge in these famous breadsticks include,

40:20.080 --> 40:24.080
the revolutionary, words mean things, you know?

40:25.520 --> 40:27.280
Pepperoni pizza breadsticks.

40:27.280 --> 40:32.960
Each order includes six of Fizzoli's signature garlic breadstick halves,

40:34.240 --> 40:37.760
and then they top them with mozzarella and pepperoni,

40:38.480 --> 40:41.280
and then they bake them to a golden perfection.

40:41.280 --> 40:46.480
So what they've done, if you can visualize this, oh, they're served with marinara for dipping.

40:46.480 --> 40:50.320
These savory cheesy pull apart breadsticks are perfect to share,

40:50.320 --> 40:53.120
or keep all to yourself, or share.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.600
Wait, please share.

40:57.040 --> 41:01.440
If you can visualize that, they've cut the breadsticks in half and then dump pizza on them.

41:02.080 --> 41:03.840
These are breadstick size, right?

41:03.840 --> 41:10.800
Like these are very thin, very thin, non sandwich size.

41:10.800 --> 41:16.800
Yeah, so you can get, it's like one pepperoni width max, maybe.

41:16.800 --> 41:17.760
Maybe.

41:17.760 --> 41:21.920
The Italian breadstick sliders are Fizzoli's signature garlic breadstick halves

41:22.720 --> 41:28.320
made into slider buns and filled with fresh premium ingredients

41:28.320 --> 41:32.160
to create three new Italian breadstick sliders.

41:32.160 --> 41:34.080
You can't just keep saying that.

41:34.080 --> 41:37.280
A smashed meatball breadstick slider.

41:37.280 --> 41:42.160
That's two meatballs topped with Fizzoli's signature marinara sliced mozzarella

41:42.800 --> 41:48.960
baked and finished with a garlic, sorry, a basil pesto drizzle,

41:48.960 --> 41:52.480
and they don't detail why it's a smashed meatball breadstick slider,

41:52.480 --> 41:53.840
but I think we can all guess.

41:53.840 --> 41:56.000
Yeah, they just can't stop fucking it up.

41:57.040 --> 42:02.960
There's a spicy Italian breadstick slider that's sliced genoa salami and capicola

42:02.960 --> 42:09.520
and a meatball topped with sliced mozzarella and baked and topped with a pepperoncini.

42:09.520 --> 42:11.120
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm trying not to laugh,

42:11.120 --> 42:16.400
but I was just thinking that probably the most fucked up thing you could do as a farmer

42:16.400 --> 42:19.840
is to look at a pig right before you butcher it and tell it that it's going to be-

42:19.840 --> 42:27.280
The components are going to be used in a spicy Italian breadstick slider.

42:27.280 --> 42:31.600
It's just the meanest, it's like, I can't imagine a war of dignity.

42:31.600 --> 42:34.480
The pig's like, I'm at least going to Olive Garden, right?

42:34.480 --> 42:37.600
And the farmer's like, oh no, friend, you're not an Olive Garden pig.

42:37.600 --> 42:40.320
Oh no, you're not an Olive Garden pig.

42:40.320 --> 42:45.760
Culinary manager Rick Petralia has one of the more sinister

42:45.760 --> 42:48.320
sounding Munch Squad quotes I've encountered.

42:49.600 --> 42:55.280
We listen and pay attention to our guests' tastes and preferences

42:55.280 --> 43:00.960
in order to craft menu items that we know they'll enjoy.

43:00.960 --> 43:04.480
So that's like, Rick's like, yeah, we've been watching you dirty sons of bitches.

43:04.480 --> 43:08.960
We got close, we smelled the stinkier trash hole of a mouth.

43:08.960 --> 43:10.560
We know what you put in there.

43:10.560 --> 43:14.480
Our guests love our signature unlimited breadsticks.

43:14.480 --> 43:16.480
So we set out, so I guess they are still unlimited,

43:16.480 --> 43:21.600
so we set out to create more ways for them to be enjoyed.

43:21.600 --> 43:23.920
You asked for this and now you've got it.

43:23.920 --> 43:26.160
You've got it, you dirty pigs.

43:26.160 --> 43:30.800
We're excited to give our loyal fans in Indianapolis

43:30.800 --> 43:34.000
the first chance to try these delicious new menu items.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.120
They are the perfect snack for any occasion.

43:37.920 --> 43:41.600
After all, life is always better with breadsticks.

43:41.600 --> 43:43.920
What the fuck are you talking about, Rick?

43:43.920 --> 43:44.800
What are you saying?

43:44.800 --> 43:48.560
I also think using this word snack is this like-

43:48.560 --> 43:49.520
Snack on it.

43:49.520 --> 43:53.920
Take it with you and then, you know, when the moment comes

43:53.920 --> 43:56.560
and you'll know when it is, snack on it.

43:56.560 --> 43:58.720
If I saw someone pull one of these out on the subway,

43:58.720 --> 44:01.760
I would jump right out of the door onto the tracks to my death.

44:01.760 --> 44:04.800
No way, because I don't know what that person's capable.

44:04.800 --> 44:07.120
Actually, I do know what that person's capable of.

44:07.120 --> 44:10.080
I just finished up lunch at Fazoli's a couple hours ago

44:10.080 --> 44:13.520
and I got a couple more hours until I can go back to Fazoli's for dinner.

44:13.520 --> 44:17.840
I wish there was something in between that I could do to kind of tide me over.

44:18.480 --> 44:20.480
A cheesy boat across the river sticks.

44:21.680 --> 44:22.160
That is the-

44:22.160 --> 44:22.800
Quick.

44:22.800 --> 44:26.560
Can I say something though, right at this moment?

44:26.560 --> 44:27.840
Yeah, fuck these up.

44:27.840 --> 44:29.280
Yeah, I would annihilate.

44:29.280 --> 44:31.200
God, I would annihilate them.

44:31.200 --> 44:36.880
I'm coming to Indianapolis to eat these dirty, dirty treats.

44:37.680 --> 44:40.480
I'm coming and hey, I'm announcing on my brother,

44:40.480 --> 44:46.960
my brother and me show in Indianapolis just to eat these nasty boats.

44:47.600 --> 44:48.640
Hey, how about a yahoo?

44:49.520 --> 44:50.720
Yeah, give it to me.

44:50.720 --> 44:52.960
Here's one that was sent in by Graham Roebuck. Thanks, Graham.

44:52.960 --> 44:55.360
It's anonymous yahoo answers user, so I'm gonna call him...

44:56.960 --> 44:57.440
Ruggie.

44:58.160 --> 45:02.000
Ruggie asks, how does one become a ship captain?

45:02.720 --> 45:05.840
I don't mean a captain of a cruise ship or being a captain as a career.

45:05.840 --> 45:06.880
I just mean in general.

45:06.880 --> 45:11.280
For instance, let's just say I bought a boat for myself and my family.

45:11.280 --> 45:13.200
How do you determine who is the captain?

45:13.200 --> 45:16.320
Or another example, how would Jack Sparrow have become a captain?

45:16.320 --> 45:18.960
I don't mean all the technical stuff about Davy Jones and all that,

45:18.960 --> 45:20.800
because I know that part of it.

45:20.800 --> 45:23.680
I just mean that obviously he didn't go to university or college

45:23.680 --> 45:26.000
and professionally obtain a license to be captain,

45:26.000 --> 45:28.320
so how does that all work these days?

45:28.320 --> 45:31.760
Okay, first of all yahoo answers question asker Ruggie,

45:31.760 --> 45:35.440
how dare you undercut the Pirates of the Caribbean point

45:35.440 --> 45:39.440
I was going to make about how Jack Sparrow became a captain?

45:39.440 --> 45:41.760
How dare you take Travis's joke away from him?

45:41.760 --> 45:43.200
How dare you?

45:43.200 --> 45:46.560
I was going to talk about how he made a deal with Davy Jones

45:46.560 --> 45:49.200
to raise the Black Pearl from the bottom of the ocean

45:49.200 --> 45:52.400
and then by granting him a ship that allowed him to become a captain,

45:52.400 --> 45:54.000
and you took that from me.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.640
You know, Travis, though, I think you found a way somehow.

45:56.640 --> 45:57.120
What? Oh.

45:57.120 --> 46:01.680
I'm so glad we got those little peaks and valleys into the waveform.

46:01.680 --> 46:03.840
You can imagine my relief at that.

46:03.840 --> 46:08.000
You know, I've never seen a yahoo answers person that is so belligerent,

46:08.000 --> 46:12.880
so on guard about learning information that they are not actively seeking out.

46:12.880 --> 46:13.520
Yeah, sure.

46:13.520 --> 46:19.760
They have built an impenetrable logical fortress around themselves

46:19.760 --> 46:24.720
to keep themselves from any general tidbit that they're not actively seeking out.

46:24.720 --> 46:28.880
So the scenario presented here that I was attracted to

46:28.880 --> 46:31.040
is I buy a boat for myself and my family.

46:31.040 --> 46:32.560
How do you determine who's the captain?

46:32.560 --> 46:33.680
Is it the one?

46:33.680 --> 46:38.080
Let's say the three of us get together and we're out on the big lake

46:38.080 --> 46:40.160
and I say, I got a surprise for everybody.

46:40.160 --> 46:41.600
I bought a big boat.

46:41.600 --> 46:44.640
Am I the captain just because I'm the one that dished out the cash for it?

46:44.640 --> 46:47.040
Because I'm not convinced that I would be the best captain.

46:47.040 --> 46:47.920
No, Griffin.

46:47.920 --> 46:52.080
Captain is something that like everyone knows about somebody.

46:52.080 --> 46:58.160
And it's just like, you have to say everybody on three point to the person who is the captain.

46:58.160 --> 47:02.560
And I guarantee you nine times out of ten, everyone's going to point at the same person.

47:02.560 --> 47:05.440
Everyone will just inherently be like, that is the captain.

47:05.440 --> 47:09.600
Because it's not a position that's earned or granted or anything.

47:09.600 --> 47:14.880
One is just born a captain or else why would you be allowed to like perform weddings and stuff

47:14.880 --> 47:18.320
and throw people in the brig if it just meant nothing?

47:18.320 --> 47:19.120
You know what I mean?

47:19.120 --> 47:24.400
Like you are preordained to be a captain at birth.

47:24.400 --> 47:29.600
It's like when Martin Short inherited a boat and he went down to go look at it

47:29.600 --> 47:32.160
and he had no idea what to do.

47:32.880 --> 47:34.160
He wandered the street.

47:34.160 --> 47:40.560
There's that 15 minute scene in Captain Ron of him wandering the streets of the place in Florida,

47:40.560 --> 47:41.200
I guess.

47:41.200 --> 47:46.160
And until he found a captain and he couldn't do it himself,

47:46.160 --> 47:51.840
even though he had written and read several books about nautical matters.

47:51.840 --> 47:52.720
Yeah, he knew.

47:52.720 --> 47:53.920
He was a boat scholar.

47:53.920 --> 47:56.720
He knew the information, but he hadn't absorbed it.

47:56.720 --> 47:58.080
It wasn't in his marrow.

47:58.080 --> 47:59.120
Of the waves.

47:59.120 --> 47:59.840
Yes.

47:59.840 --> 48:03.040
I have a theory, by the way, listener, that I'd like to put in your brain

48:03.040 --> 48:04.560
because I think about it all the time.

48:04.560 --> 48:07.680
I developed a theory upon one of my many viewings of Captain Ron.

48:08.640 --> 48:14.800
You know how that one diehard movie, Die Hard with a Vengeance,

48:14.800 --> 48:17.120
was originally written as a lethal weapon film?

48:17.120 --> 48:20.560
You guys know this bit of trivia and then they repurposed it as a diehard film?

48:20.560 --> 48:21.600
Absolutely not.

48:21.600 --> 48:23.280
I didn't know that.

48:23.280 --> 48:30.800
I have this theory that Captain Ron was originally written as a national lampoon film,

48:30.800 --> 48:34.400
which I assume would have been titled National Lampoon's Caribbean Vacation.

48:35.360 --> 48:40.640
Because if you think about, if you replace Chevy Chase in the Martin Short role

48:40.640 --> 48:43.520
and then you replace Captain Ron with Cousin Eddie,

48:43.520 --> 48:46.400
who for some reason has some sort of nautical knowledge,

48:46.400 --> 48:48.880
we can get that in post and figure that in the scripting process.

48:48.880 --> 48:50.000
Well, that's why they switched it over.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.520
They couldn't crack that nut.

48:51.520 --> 48:57.200
If you replace all that stuff, it is beat for beat what that film would have been.

48:57.200 --> 49:00.720
That imaginary film that I came up with would have been Captain Ron.

49:00.720 --> 49:05.360
I would swear on a sack of Bibles it was written as a national lampoon movie

49:05.360 --> 49:08.160
and no one will ever, one of the vacation films specifically.

49:08.160 --> 49:12.320
And I've never found any validation of this online,

49:12.320 --> 49:16.160
but if you're the screenwriter of that film, please get in touch.

49:16.160 --> 49:19.440
I would like to return to a thought exercise that Travis presented just a few minutes ago

49:19.440 --> 49:21.680
before we talked about Captain Ron for a long, long time,

49:21.680 --> 49:22.960
the longest time that's ever been.

49:23.680 --> 49:25.760
I would like each of us, I'll count to three,

49:25.760 --> 49:28.320
and then each of us say the name of which of the three of us would be the captain.

49:28.320 --> 49:29.680
You are allowed to say yourself.

49:29.680 --> 49:30.720
Okay, okay.

49:31.280 --> 49:32.320
And I want no hurt feelings.

49:32.320 --> 49:34.000
I don't want us to get our ego in this.

49:34.000 --> 49:34.880
This doesn't mean anything.

49:34.880 --> 49:36.960
It's a joke for a podcast, but when we do buy a boat,

49:36.960 --> 49:38.800
it is going to be legally binding.

49:38.800 --> 49:39.300
Okay.

49:40.800 --> 49:44.560
One, two, three, Travis.

49:44.560 --> 49:45.440
Travis.

49:45.440 --> 49:46.240
Yeah, okay.

49:46.240 --> 49:46.720
Okay, cool.

49:46.720 --> 49:48.000
I thought that might be the case.

49:48.000 --> 49:48.960
Now let me say this.

49:48.960 --> 49:51.440
Let's count to three and everybody say the reason why.

49:52.080 --> 49:58.320
So one, two, three, because you've seen Pirates of the Caribbean.

49:58.320 --> 50:00.320
Okay, so then we're all on the same-

50:00.320 --> 50:01.520
Beard, I said beard.

50:01.520 --> 50:02.800
Oh, you said beard.

50:02.800 --> 50:04.000
Mine was beard.

50:04.000 --> 50:04.560
Dang.

50:04.560 --> 50:05.760
Mine was beard.

50:05.760 --> 50:08.400
That's a sea beard to catch the salt air.

50:08.400 --> 50:09.280
That is fair.

50:09.280 --> 50:09.840
Yeah, that's great.

50:09.840 --> 50:12.240
We can sort of stand behind Travis and draft on him.

50:12.240 --> 50:13.920
He's going to get all that nasty salt.

50:13.920 --> 50:17.840
He's sort of like God's air purifier with that beard.

50:17.840 --> 50:18.720
Thank you.

50:18.720 --> 50:21.680
I do like that Griffin and I, our heads were in the same place.

50:21.680 --> 50:24.480
I was like, Travis has probably the most nautical knowledge

50:24.480 --> 50:27.760
just through osmosis of seeing Pirates of the Caribbean movies.

50:27.760 --> 50:28.720
I have a new game.

50:29.520 --> 50:30.880
It's called Who's the Captain?

50:31.520 --> 50:34.880
And I'm going to name some casts of some films

50:34.880 --> 50:37.440
and you tell me some ensemble casts

50:37.440 --> 50:40.560
and you're going to tell me who's the captain.

50:40.560 --> 50:42.960
Okay, now let me ask just to clarify.

50:42.960 --> 50:46.080
Are we talking about the actors or the characters?

50:46.800 --> 50:48.080
Oh man, that's tough.

50:48.960 --> 50:50.160
I think the actors, right?

50:50.160 --> 50:51.920
Which actor is the most captain-like?

50:51.920 --> 50:56.320
Okay, this first one starts out hard and it only gets harder.

50:56.320 --> 50:59.520
The, oh fuck, just give me a fucking ad blocker.

51:00.160 --> 51:01.440
Fuck, fuck you.

51:01.440 --> 51:04.240
Damn, it'd be such a shame if we weren't able to do this bit.

51:04.240 --> 51:04.800
You think?

51:05.520 --> 51:07.280
Fuck me, I'm not going to be able to sleep tonight.

51:08.640 --> 51:09.680
Okay, here we go.

51:09.680 --> 51:10.960
Oh, thank Christ.

51:10.960 --> 51:11.920
The Breakfast Club.

51:12.720 --> 51:13.760
The Breakfast Club.

51:13.760 --> 51:18.720
We're talking Emilio, talking Molly Sheedy, Anthony Michael Hall,

51:18.720 --> 51:20.560
Judd Nelson, Maya Ringwald.

51:20.560 --> 51:21.520
Hold on, hold on.

51:21.520 --> 51:22.400
Ally Sheedy.

51:22.400 --> 51:23.280
Ally Sheedy.

51:23.280 --> 51:24.400
Stop the game.

51:24.400 --> 51:25.040
Okay.

51:25.040 --> 51:26.960
There wasn't a boat in Breakfast Club.

51:26.960 --> 51:29.680
There doesn't have to be a boat.

51:29.680 --> 51:31.280
There doesn't have to be a boat in it.

51:31.280 --> 51:32.880
Oh, who is the captain?

51:32.880 --> 51:33.600
Okay.

51:33.600 --> 51:38.000
If they all bought a boat, as soon as the movie ended, who's the captain?

51:38.000 --> 51:38.640
Yeah, okay.

51:38.640 --> 51:39.600
Well, this is a trick.

51:39.600 --> 51:41.280
It's a trick question, Justin.

51:41.280 --> 51:42.240
Why is that?

51:42.240 --> 51:46.320
Because I think that Emilio Estevez will be appointed captain,

51:46.320 --> 51:51.360
but by the end of the film, we find out that like Judd Nelson is the captain.

51:51.360 --> 51:52.800
See, I was going to say Molly Ringwald.

51:52.800 --> 51:55.120
This is not the best game, though.

51:55.120 --> 51:56.240
It's the only problem.

51:57.040 --> 51:57.360
Okay.

51:57.360 --> 51:58.000
Let's try it again.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.400
Maybe the first round was just a little off.

52:00.400 --> 52:04.400
Steven Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio del Toro, Kevin Pollack, Chas Balmentieri,

52:04.960 --> 52:06.160
and Kevin Spacey.

52:06.160 --> 52:07.600
Okay, I know who's not the captain.

52:07.600 --> 52:08.160
Yeah, I know who's going to get kill hauled.

52:08.160 --> 52:09.360
The usual suspects.

52:10.800 --> 52:14.000
So we're going to say, who of those people is the captain?

52:14.000 --> 52:14.800
Are you ready?

52:14.800 --> 52:15.520
Kevin Pollack.

52:16.160 --> 52:18.000
Yeah, that's who I was leaning to.

52:18.640 --> 52:20.160
See, I was thinking Benicio.

52:20.160 --> 52:22.800
I was going to give him the captainship.

52:22.800 --> 52:23.040
Okay, let me give you-

52:23.040 --> 52:26.320
Look around your friends, your friend group, and see if you can figure out who the-

52:26.880 --> 52:28.240
Which one of them is the captain?

52:29.360 --> 52:31.040
Okay, I have one to pitch for you.

52:31.040 --> 52:31.440
Okay.

52:31.440 --> 52:33.280
Star Trek First Contact.

52:34.160 --> 52:35.440
Who's the captain?

52:35.440 --> 52:37.360
Who's the captain of that one?

52:37.360 --> 52:38.880
On Star Trek First Cap-

52:38.880 --> 52:40.320
Worf!

52:45.040 --> 52:46.560
That one's Worf.

52:46.560 --> 52:47.440
That one is Worf.

52:47.440 --> 52:49.120
On that one, it's Worf.

52:49.120 --> 52:51.120
His name is already a boat thing.

52:54.640 --> 52:55.360
Related.

52:56.720 --> 52:59.760
Folks, thank you so much for listening to our dumb, dumb podcast.

52:59.760 --> 53:02.240
My brother, my brother, me, we hope you've enjoyed yourself.

53:03.520 --> 53:05.200
We know we've enjoyed having you.

53:06.000 --> 53:10.400
One to mention, as always, at the beginning of a month, I guess it's sort of,

53:10.400 --> 53:14.000
we're getting closer to mid-month now, as unfathomable as that may be,

53:14.000 --> 53:20.720
we've got a new pin in the McElroy Merch Squad, which you can find at McElroyMerch.com.

53:20.720 --> 53:30.480
This month's new pin is a beautiful shrimp with Angelic Halo on it, designed by Elena Hoyt.

53:30.480 --> 53:33.120
You can find that pin, along with a lot of other great merchandise.

53:33.120 --> 53:38.000
That one's only available through June, though, so make sure you get that if you want it.

53:38.000 --> 53:43.360
I also want to say we have the San Francisco and Phoenix shows coming up.

53:43.360 --> 53:44.640
Thanks, San Francisco.

53:44.640 --> 53:46.880
Yeah, well, in fact, I know San Francisco's called out.

53:46.880 --> 53:49.520
I think there are still some tickets to that Phoenix show.

53:49.520 --> 53:52.560
So if you want to join us, you can go to McElroyShows.com

53:53.440 --> 53:55.200
tours and get your tickets there.

53:55.200 --> 53:59.920
And you can also get tickets to our other upcoming shows in Orlando and Atlanta,

53:59.920 --> 54:04.720
as well as our Adventure Zone graphic novel book tour, which is coming up in mid-July.

54:04.720 --> 54:07.440
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

54:07.440 --> 54:09.520
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

54:09.520 --> 54:12.640
It's got all the songs on it ever recorded.

54:12.640 --> 54:18.480
So Saturday Night Fever, all of the other songs.

54:18.480 --> 54:21.920
And that's all on Putting the Days to Bed by the Long Winters.

54:21.920 --> 54:23.680

Yeah.

54:40.960 --> 54:41.920
You know it.

54:41.920 --> 54:43.440
It was sent in by Andy Schiff.

54:43.440 --> 54:44.000
Thanks, Andy.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.200
It's Yahoo Answers user?

54:45.840 --> 54:47.520
Question mark, so I'll call him.

54:48.880 --> 54:50.880
Bernardf asks,

54:53.520 --> 54:56.400
is the ASS all that matters these days?

55:00.400 --> 55:04.320
Mine is just McElroy and I vote yes.

55:04.960 --> 55:07.840
I'm Travis McElroy and the research just isn't in yet.

55:08.800 --> 55:11.440
My name is Griffin McElroy and I'm not-

55:11.440 --> 55:12.160
This is gross.

55:12.160 --> 55:13.200
I'm not going to joke about that.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.360
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

55:15.360 --> 55:16.240
Kiss your dad.

55:16.240 --> 55:17.520
Square on the lips.

We've all made mistakes in book club, right?

55:45.600 --> 55:47.120
You drink a little too much.

55:47.120 --> 55:48.320
You don't actually read the book.

55:49.200 --> 55:51.440
And if you're under the bubble in Fairhaven,

55:52.000 --> 55:54.880
your individual will get subsumed by the collective.

55:54.880 --> 55:58.320
Hey, maybe I just let him go and whip us up some guac.

55:58.320 --> 56:00.480
We do not require guac.

56:00.480 --> 56:03.920
We require only nutrients and expansion.

56:03.920 --> 56:06.080
You will become book club.

56:06.080 --> 56:08.640
You will eat, pray and love with us.

56:09.200 --> 56:10.560
