00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:50.160
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, and moi. I mean me. My name's Justin

00:50.160 --> 00:57.760
McElroy. C'est magnifique. My name is Lord Travis McElroy. And I am Duncan Worschteshire.

00:57.760 --> 01:06.080
Hi, Duke. Hi, Duke of the Andes Mountains. If you haven't heard the news already,

01:06.640 --> 01:16.800
the Max Fun Drive hit its initial goal of 2,000 donors with just the first week in the rearview

01:16.800 --> 01:24.240
mirror of our jet skis. I believe you mean two milla donors. See, I'm using the metric system

01:24.240 --> 01:34.160
now. Oh. So, in case you're wondering, we are now predicting that we will reach that goal

01:35.440 --> 01:41.200
of the new goal of 4,000 donors and perhaps- Fuck that old goal. Fuck the old goal. Sorry

01:41.200 --> 01:47.120
about the coarse language. We'll reach the goal of 4,000 donors in about three days,

01:47.120 --> 01:52.320
and we'll reach 8,000 donors by the end of the drive, and we'll finally take our place

01:52.320 --> 01:59.200
amongst the super elite rich. I've already gone looking at super yachts. I am saving up

01:59.680 --> 02:06.240
all of my money to have the person who is mowing their lawn outside fucking constantly every time

02:06.240 --> 02:12.800
I record any bit of audio medium, I will have them killed. And you'll be rich enough to get

02:12.800 --> 02:18.240
away with it. Oh, absolutely. And if not- Oh, we will be murdering left and right. And if not,

02:18.240 --> 02:26.880
I will go to badminton jail. What are you two going to miss the most about being able to relate

02:26.880 --> 02:37.120
to our common listeners? Probably being able to eat the simpler cheeses. Yeah, me too. I used to

02:37.120 --> 02:45.280
get down on some Kraft single slices, and that's just not- Oh my God. Can you guys PayPal me your

02:45.280 --> 02:49.680
shares of the max fund money that you already have so I can have this person murdered, and I can get

02:49.680 --> 02:55.360
one good audio quality recording for once in my goddamn life. Sorry, go ahead. What were you saying?

02:55.360 --> 03:01.200
Oh yeah, we're very rich. What are you going to miss, Justin? I'll miss, you know, right now I can

03:01.200 --> 03:08.640
go to the store and I can look at a gallon of milk and tell you about what it costs. Once I'm among

03:08.640 --> 03:12.880
the super rich- Because the price is on the thing underneath it. Once I'm among the super rich,

03:12.880 --> 03:19.520
I imagine I'll pick up a gallon of milk and say, what, from cows? Because I'll only drink milk from-

03:19.520 --> 03:28.560
Is this one gold? Can I get a single fucking cent? That's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna make a spin-off

03:28.560 --> 03:34.560
show with my riches, and it's gonna be called Justin and Some Silent Guys, and I'll be able

03:34.560 --> 03:40.240
to finish all my jokes and they'll just be like, two little Ed McManns just yucking it up. That's

03:40.240 --> 03:48.640
my dream. But only then will you realize, like, I miss it. You'll start a sentence and finish it and

03:48.640 --> 03:52.400
go, well, that was kind of depressing. Well, I didn't have an ending. I had no ending to that

03:52.400 --> 03:55.600
sentence. I never do, and I rely on my profits to step in it. I can say with 100% confidence,

03:55.600 --> 04:00.720
that will not happen. No way. No problems there. There would have been time now. Ocelot

04:00.720 --> 04:07.760
milk was the punchline to that one, Griffin, if you could get it in post. Yeah, I've been getting

04:07.760 --> 04:11.600
real good at that. That would be the thing we could actually do is pay someone to actually edit the

04:11.600 --> 04:19.840
show. I am just gonna miss Hardee's, I think. They won't even let you in. No. Excuse me, sir,

04:19.840 --> 04:24.880
you are far too wealthy to be in here. You're making everyone uncomfortable. The only person

04:24.880 --> 04:31.600
as wealthy as you allow in here is Hardee, our owner and CEO. Ed Hardee, the owner.

04:31.600 --> 04:38.720
You can go to Shardee's, which is a version of Hardee's that only serves Swiss chard and chardonnay.

04:40.880 --> 04:45.760
That'd be a good lunch. God, what a good fucking joke. Do you guys want to do some advice? Oh,

04:45.760 --> 04:51.360
thank you all for donating to Max Fun Drive. It's been a pretty killer response. It's sort of blown

04:51.360 --> 04:57.600
away our wildest hopes and our craziest dreams, but we're still going. Does that mean that you

04:57.600 --> 05:03.440
should get a free pass? No. No. It's time to knuckle down and get a donation in. Time to knuckle

05:03.440 --> 05:10.320
buck. Time to knuckle buck. Time to triple deke us into the super rich. We're over 2,000 donors,

05:10.320 --> 05:15.520
which is our original goal. If we get up to 2,500, Jesse and Jordan will... Are they gonna

05:15.520 --> 05:20.880
record an actual episode out on... In a gross lake. In a gross, gross lake. Travis is gonna

05:20.880 --> 05:26.480
get him a bim bam tattoo that the internet is still deciding on what that's gonna look like.

05:26.480 --> 05:32.000
If we crush it, if we get to 4,000 donors, we're gonna do two bonus episodes of every show

05:32.000 --> 05:39.040
on the network. So two extra bim bams and two extra adventure zones and two extra saw bones and

05:39.040 --> 05:44.800
two extra bunker buddies is a lot of extra shit that we're gonna do over the course of the year

05:44.800 --> 05:49.040
if we get to 4,000. So if you haven't donated and you need a reason to, that's a good one.

05:49.840 --> 05:53.520
We already decided beforehand that one of our bonus episodes would be

05:53.520 --> 05:59.440
the much, the much requested My Sister, My Sister and Me, where our wives get to answer an episode

05:59.440 --> 06:04.960
full of advice. So if you've wanted that one, that would be just one of the many audio delights to

06:04.960 --> 06:12.000
tickle your timpani, timpanic membranes. And not only that, but for every member who signs up or

06:12.000 --> 06:17.760
upgrades above the 2,000 goal, so like it's already happening, Max Funds is gonna donate five meals to

06:17.760 --> 06:22.560
hungry families in Los Angeles to the LA Regional Food Bank. So not only are you giving back to the

06:22.560 --> 06:28.560
network, you're giving back to other people who need it way more than us. So it's an awesome thing

06:28.560 --> 06:33.120
to do. The heat is on. We'll tell you all about how to donate, what you get for donating. Let me get

06:33.120 --> 06:38.880
you a URL though real quick. Yeah, yeah. It's maximumfund.org. We'll tell you all about that

06:38.880 --> 06:44.320
stuff, what you get, all that good stuff later on. But for now, it's vision. I think that's a word.

06:44.320 --> 06:49.440
Wow, there we are inside the lawnmower now. Whoa, guys, watch out for the blades. Duck, duck, duck.

06:49.440 --> 06:56.080
This is like Honey I Shrunk the Kids but in audio form. Right. It's a lot cheaper to produce is the

06:56.080 --> 07:01.520
nice thing. That actually was how Honey I Shrunk the Kids first existed as a radio play in the 40s

07:01.520 --> 07:05.680
when they adapted it into a movie. Not a lot of people know that. It's based on,

07:05.680 --> 07:11.600
it came on between The Shadow and The George Burns Show. Look at these minuscule children.

07:12.640 --> 07:17.280
It was originally called Sweetums. I enshrinkified these level adults we call our kids.

07:17.280 --> 07:22.640
And they shortened it in the Crest Time Fun Happy Family Hour.

07:24.080 --> 07:30.000
Welcome once again to the Crest Fun Time Happy Hour. For Sweetums, I enshrink the lovable adults

07:30.000 --> 07:36.240
we call our children starring Cary Grant as Wayne Zelinsky and Deborah Winger.

07:37.600 --> 07:41.120
The immortal vampire. The immortal Deborah Winger,

07:41.680 --> 07:46.560
which I mean quite literally as Mrs. Zelinsky.

07:46.560 --> 07:51.920
As Dracula. We don't know what we're doing. Honey, I've enshrunking the kids again.

07:53.360 --> 07:59.440
Advice time is two minutes ago. It's half past advice. My sister-in-law is a notorious regifter

07:59.440 --> 08:04.720
even of used items. She once gave me a partially burned candle, food from her own freezer,

08:04.720 --> 08:10.720
and four half-used bottles of dishwashing soap as housewarming gifts. Even when a present is new,

08:10.720 --> 08:15.840
she'll tell me it's a regift and why she didn't want it. Should I refuse her unwanted junk or

08:15.840 --> 08:21.120
would that make me as rude as her? And that's from looking a regift horse in the mouth.

08:21.680 --> 08:23.840
Why is she giving you her garbage?

08:23.840 --> 08:28.320
Is your house shaped like a garbage can? Like that one woman's house was shaped like a boot?

08:30.160 --> 08:33.120
Wait, do you mean the little old lady who lives in the shoe, Griffin?

08:33.120 --> 08:37.200
Yeah, you a little old lady who lives in a basuda.

08:37.840 --> 08:39.600
Are you Oscar the Grouch?

08:39.600 --> 08:43.360
Are you Oscar the Grouch even? Did you even consider that?

08:43.360 --> 08:49.840
Actually, at the end, it looks like the email address is oscarthegrouch at grinder.com.

08:49.840 --> 08:54.000
At grinder.com? I don't think they offer domains. That is weird.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.400
That's weird. He must be on the staff.

08:56.400 --> 09:02.720
Let me check the ISP and let me just tap this into my CSI cyber search. Yeah, it says garbage can.

09:03.920 --> 09:06.800
Grindr's run out of a garbage can by Oscar the Grouch?

09:06.800 --> 09:13.600
Yeah, I've always suspected, but now I can confirm that Oscar the Grouch runs the website

09:13.600 --> 09:21.600
and sex service Grindr out of a garbage can. This is the worst thing. I don't understand.

09:21.600 --> 09:25.360
Even when a present is new, she'll tell you it's a regift and why she didn't want it.

09:25.360 --> 09:31.600
Are they saying that when she buys this from a goddamn Lowe's and brings it to your house,

09:31.600 --> 09:33.200
brand new, says, by the way-

09:33.200 --> 09:34.880
She not only regifts.

09:34.880 --> 09:36.880
New as in unopened.

09:36.880 --> 09:41.200
Okay, so not a half-used bottle of goddamn dishwashing soap.

09:41.200 --> 09:42.720
Do you think she's saying it like,

09:43.920 --> 09:49.280
hey, this is actually such and so company, but I already had a toaster and I didn't need it,

09:49.280 --> 09:54.160
so I thought you would like it? Or is she saying, I didn't want this. Do you want it?

09:55.200 --> 10:00.400
There's some part of me that thinks in our consumption-addicted society,

10:00.400 --> 10:05.120
there's something very useful about the idea of like, well, here, I'm not making use of this,

10:05.120 --> 10:10.720
you make use of it, but really, it's just her garbage. So it's more like,

10:10.720 --> 10:12.080
will you throw this away from me?

10:12.080 --> 10:17.520
Well, that's the thing is like, I think, so in Cincinnati, there was a time where Theresa and

10:17.520 --> 10:22.480
I had like three waffle irons because it was like one had been given to us-

10:22.480 --> 10:23.760
Listen to Bragi McGee over here.

10:23.760 --> 10:27.920
I know. Well, it's that Max Fund money. One had been given to us and the other two,

10:27.920 --> 10:33.280
we had already purchased at thrift stores because one was square and one was round, right?

10:33.280 --> 10:38.560
Oh, my God. Sorry, Travis, but that's not a normal thing. You're a mad man.

10:38.560 --> 10:41.360
Well, I didn't do what my wife did. Say shit to her, Griffin.

10:41.920 --> 10:48.240
She's a mad woman. I need one square waffle stacked atop a circular waffle.

10:48.240 --> 10:51.600
Listen, Theresa and I deeply enjoy waffles.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.160
I need a multi-shaped breakfast experience.

10:54.160 --> 10:58.480
But my point being that if somebody had expressed desire, like if they had said,

10:58.480 --> 11:03.440
like, I can't find a waffle iron anywhere, I could see where you could justifiably,

11:04.000 --> 11:09.680
like for our wedding, one of our friends gave us a set of their cast iron because cast iron is

11:09.680 --> 11:13.920
the thing that like you pass along and like it's something that's supposed to be given to other

11:13.920 --> 11:16.320
people because it's already aged and treated and everything.

11:16.320 --> 11:19.040
It's got that food stank deep in it already and you want it.

11:19.040 --> 11:19.600
Exactly.

11:19.600 --> 11:20.320
It takes a long time.

11:20.320 --> 11:22.560
You do want that. It's a weird thing. It's the one thing,

11:22.560 --> 11:25.600
cast iron skillets are the one thing in your house that you want dirty.

11:25.600 --> 11:26.000
Yes.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.600
You want to leave some dirt on them.

11:27.600 --> 11:34.240
That re-gifting makes sense. A half-burned candle and some used dishwashing soap bottles.

11:34.240 --> 11:37.680
I think we've all been at a place with a candle where you're looking at a new candle and you're

11:37.680 --> 11:39.200
like, where do I even start?

11:39.200 --> 11:39.440
Right.

11:40.000 --> 11:46.160
I wish there was an easy jumping off point with this candle. Some sort of origin.

11:46.160 --> 11:48.160
Like Dr. Who. Where do I get on board?

11:48.160 --> 11:48.480
Right.

11:48.480 --> 11:51.760
Here it is. Let me burn it down enough for you.

11:51.760 --> 11:55.120
What if it's one of those candles that has a $10 bill inside?

11:55.120 --> 12:01.040
You guys do have, I mean, I'm sure everybody has had a candle in their house that they just

12:01.040 --> 12:04.480
haven't talked into yet because they're not sure they're ready for the commitment, right?

12:05.600 --> 12:09.360
Or even worse, you light it and then you're like, oh, this smells like cookie farts.

12:09.360 --> 12:12.400
But maybe somebody else likes cookie farts.

12:13.040 --> 12:15.920
And like, what are you going to do with that candle? Just throw it away?

12:15.920 --> 12:17.520
You burned it once.

12:17.520 --> 12:19.680
You give it to somebody and you say, I hate this.

12:19.680 --> 12:23.760
I hate this. I hope you like it, but if you don't, chain it, my brother.

12:23.760 --> 12:29.520
I live a pretty confrontation free lifestyle and it works for me.

12:29.520 --> 12:31.680
Not always, but most of the time it works for me.

12:31.680 --> 12:37.680
If one of the two of you came to my house with an old shitty candle and a couple half

12:37.680 --> 12:45.040
used bags of bagel bites and four half used bottles of dishwashing soap, I would say,

12:45.040 --> 12:46.560
do not bring those into my house.

12:46.560 --> 12:51.040
They're wrapped though, it's a secret.

12:51.040 --> 12:55.040
I picture these just in like a kind of torn up grocery bag.

12:55.760 --> 12:56.960
That's the worst part.

12:56.960 --> 12:58.560
Used gifts, beautifully wrapped.

12:59.280 --> 13:06.720
$45, they're gold flaked wrapped and they spent so much money on the wrapping,

13:06.720 --> 13:08.640
just invest that into the product itself.

13:08.640 --> 13:12.320
Get me two unused bottles of dishwashing soap.

13:12.320 --> 13:17.600
To fucking take the four bottles, reallocate them into two bottles

13:17.600 --> 13:19.600
and it will at least look newer.

13:19.600 --> 13:20.320
What are you doing?

13:20.320 --> 13:21.760
That's just lazy.

13:21.760 --> 13:24.560
Question asker, I'm going to tell you exactly what you should do here.

13:25.520 --> 13:26.320
This is the thing.

13:27.280 --> 13:32.880
In gift giving, it is universally agreed that it is the thought that counts, right?

13:32.880 --> 13:34.720
And I think that works both ways.

13:36.080 --> 13:39.920
If the thought sucks, which it does here.

13:39.920 --> 13:43.120
Exactly, because basically what this person is doing is saying,

13:43.120 --> 13:45.680
I didn't pick out a gift for you.

13:45.680 --> 13:48.320
I gave you something I already had.

13:48.320 --> 13:52.800
So the thought is as minimal as it could possibly be

13:52.800 --> 13:56.240
and still on some technical level be considered a gift.

13:56.800 --> 13:59.600
So I think you are completely within your rights to say like,

13:59.600 --> 14:00.480
I don't want this.

14:02.240 --> 14:05.600
This is not a thing that applies to me specifically.

14:05.600 --> 14:09.120
This is stuff you had at your house that you're trying to get rid of.

14:09.120 --> 14:11.440
I'd rather not take it into my house.

14:11.440 --> 14:12.160
Thank you.

14:12.160 --> 14:15.680
Although I will say it's really satisfying

14:15.680 --> 14:22.240
when you're doing like a cleansing of your cleaning supplies

14:22.240 --> 14:27.040
and you say, I have so many goddamn half-used bottles of dishwashing soap under the sink.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.120
I'm just going to toss them all and start over.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.880
And then you have so much more room down there

14:30.880 --> 14:34.240
and this person is giving you that experience from the start.

14:34.240 --> 14:38.080
You just put them right under the sink, look at them, survey your goods

14:38.080 --> 14:39.840
and say, no, this will not do.

14:39.840 --> 14:42.560
Put those right in the garbage and go out and buy new soap.

14:42.560 --> 14:44.400
As my housewarming present to you,

14:44.400 --> 14:47.520
I'm giving you the future opportunity to throw these away

14:47.520 --> 14:48.960
and feel good about yourself.

14:48.960 --> 14:49.920
Yeah, exactly.

14:49.920 --> 14:52.240
This half-used candle, I'm never going to finish this.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.400
I don't particularly like the candle stink it makes.

14:56.160 --> 14:59.920
Have you considered the possibility that the gift is the paper?

14:59.920 --> 15:01.440
Like have you checked for maps?

15:02.160 --> 15:04.480
Have you done a map check on the gift wrap?

15:04.480 --> 15:07.040
Or maybe it's like if you put together the clues

15:07.040 --> 15:09.360
and you're like, what does half-burned candle

15:09.360 --> 15:12.560
plus garbage food from your freezer

15:12.560 --> 15:15.680
plus four half-empty bottles of dishwashing soap?

15:15.680 --> 15:17.600
Oh my God, I know where the Constitution is.

15:18.480 --> 15:19.920
Well, yeah, we all do.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.520
It's like at a museum.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.320
No, you know where the American Constitution is.

15:24.320 --> 15:26.640
Oh shit, which one are we talking about?

15:26.640 --> 15:27.680
McDonnelland.

15:27.680 --> 15:29.520
The McDonnelland Constitution.

15:30.400 --> 15:33.680
I took a McDonnelland Constitution once and I got kicked out.

15:33.680 --> 15:37.440
We the people, in order to form a more perfect burger,

15:39.600 --> 15:41.280
that's the Constitution, right?

15:41.280 --> 15:43.040
Or the deck, nobody can keep it straight.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.200
We hold these pickles to be self-evident.

15:45.840 --> 15:48.320
And by the way, would you take these pickles

15:48.320 --> 15:49.360
or just hold them in our bare hands?

15:49.360 --> 15:51.440
They're getting warm in my sweaty palm.

15:51.440 --> 15:54.320
All fry guys are created equal.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.280
Do you guys want a yahoo?

15:55.280 --> 15:57.040
Can we, can I talk about, can I,

15:57.040 --> 15:58.880
I know we talk about McDonnelland every episode.

15:58.880 --> 16:00.400
Can I say something about McDonnelland real quick?

16:00.400 --> 16:00.800
No, please.

16:00.800 --> 16:05.760
It is a really weird makeup of residents in McDonnelland,

16:05.760 --> 16:06.800
if you think about it,

16:06.800 --> 16:11.440
because half of their population is constituted from like

16:14.480 --> 16:15.520
anthropomorphized.

16:16.160 --> 16:17.280
French fry monsters.

16:17.280 --> 16:18.000
Food.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.800
Well, there's the fry guys, which are made of french fries.

16:20.800 --> 16:24.240
There's the Mayor of McCheese, who has a hamburger.

16:25.280 --> 16:28.720
The other half of the McDonnelland constituency

16:28.720 --> 16:31.760
is made up of people who are almost defined

16:31.760 --> 16:34.560
by their desire to eat McDonald's food.

16:35.200 --> 16:38.960
Is there a food chain of McDonnelland,

16:38.960 --> 16:40.960
like a very grim reality where like,

16:40.960 --> 16:43.360
you have a person who's like whole thing,

16:43.360 --> 16:44.320
hamburger is like.

16:45.280 --> 16:46.960
He wants to steal, he wants to steal and eat

16:46.960 --> 16:47.760
Mayor of McCheese's head.

16:47.760 --> 16:48.960
That's all there is fucking to it.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.720
He wants to decapitate Mayor of McCheese,

16:50.720 --> 16:52.960
take that, and then nobody would ever see him again

16:52.960 --> 16:53.840
because it's a perfect crime.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.920
That's the one, that is the last job

16:55.920 --> 16:57.360
that he will ever need to do.

16:57.360 --> 16:58.720
And then he can retire.

16:58.720 --> 17:00.960
Every night before they put Grimace in prison,

17:00.960 --> 17:03.200
they count the number of fry guys there are.

17:03.200 --> 17:05.440
Because if there's one missing, you know he got out

17:05.440 --> 17:06.880
and it's somebody's ass.

17:06.880 --> 17:08.720
Do you think that they created Grimace

17:08.720 --> 17:10.800
as like the embodiment of how you feel

17:10.800 --> 17:12.400
after you eat too much McDonald's?

17:13.760 --> 17:16.960
That is actually accurate, both in like physical,

17:17.520 --> 17:20.880
just like vest, like his look and his name.

17:22.480 --> 17:24.000
And then there's a bird woman.

17:24.000 --> 17:24.720
What the fuck?

17:25.680 --> 17:27.280
How about a little bit of consistency?

17:27.280 --> 17:29.440
The world was designing, the world was eating a McDonald's

17:29.440 --> 17:31.520
and there were just a hundred pigeons outside

17:31.520 --> 17:34.560
eating all the fries scattered around the ground.

17:35.840 --> 17:38.000
Or the nuggets come from her.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.520
Like every action, she just looks under her armpit

17:41.520 --> 17:43.040
and there's like three more nuggets like,

17:43.040 --> 17:45.840
good news guys, got another delivery.

17:45.840 --> 17:46.640
Who are you?

17:46.640 --> 17:48.240
Where are the apple pie boys?

17:50.080 --> 17:51.360
I don't know about that.

17:52.960 --> 17:55.280
Yo, I'm the Shamrock Shake.

17:55.280 --> 17:57.040
I only come around once a year.

17:57.040 --> 17:57.440
Why is that?

17:57.440 --> 17:58.960
Who's got a couch for me?

17:58.960 --> 18:00.480
Not again, Shamrock Shake.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.720
You would think maybe he would be Irish.

18:02.720 --> 18:04.240
No, he's from Boston.

18:04.240 --> 18:04.640
All right.

18:04.640 --> 18:05.520
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

18:06.320 --> 18:07.040
Yes, please.

18:08.240 --> 18:09.040
This Yahoo.

18:09.040 --> 18:10.400
I'm walking here.

18:10.400 --> 18:13.920
This Yahoo was, this Yahoo was sent in by Carrie Poppy.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.920
A little bit across podcast fusion.

18:16.800 --> 18:19.200
It's all about synergy here because now we're rich

18:19.200 --> 18:20.880
and we know all about things like synergy.

18:20.880 --> 18:21.360
It's by Yahoo.

18:21.360 --> 18:22.800
She is from Oh No Ross and Carrie,

18:22.800 --> 18:24.160
which you should also listen to

18:24.160 --> 18:25.680
on the maximumfund.org network.

18:25.680 --> 18:29.920
There was a quick diversion.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.920
We were on a thread talking about different maximum fund shows

18:33.920 --> 18:35.120
and she mentioned in passing

18:35.120 --> 18:36.880
that Oh No Ross and Carrie episodes

18:36.880 --> 18:40.800
take anywhere between 10 and 80 hours

18:40.800 --> 18:42.560
of investigative research.

18:42.560 --> 18:43.200
Can you?

18:43.840 --> 18:44.400
Just like us.

18:45.920 --> 18:46.960
That McDonald land bit,

18:46.960 --> 18:49.200
that took us 12 hours of researching

18:50.480 --> 18:54.960
the physical makeup of every McDonald land creature.

18:54.960 --> 18:57.520
This show would be biannual.

18:57.520 --> 18:59.120
We could literally, it could be like,

18:59.120 --> 19:01.200
man, I can't wait for another Equinox

19:01.200 --> 19:03.520
so I can get another My Brother, My Brother and Me episode.

19:04.160 --> 19:04.960
Carrie Poppy sent this in.

19:04.960 --> 19:05.360
Thank you, Carrie.

19:05.360 --> 19:06.560
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.840
I am trying to look at their name

19:09.840 --> 19:13.360
and it says sorry, something has gone wrong

19:13.360 --> 19:14.320
and it won't load.

19:14.320 --> 19:14.960
So, yep.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.120
Well, that's not at all ominous.

19:18.320 --> 19:22.160
Sorry, something has gone wrong asks Peter pop off miracle water

19:22.160 --> 19:25.040
to cure obese cat.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.680
Hi, my cat Sammy is a male cat, six years old,

19:27.680 --> 19:29.840
but he is very obese because he loves butter.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.160
I am Christian.

19:32.160 --> 19:33.120
I am Christian.

19:33.120 --> 19:34.880
And I noticed Peter pop off.

19:36.400 --> 19:39.360
Actually, they have misspelled it here as Peter po poof.

19:42.560 --> 19:46.080
Peter po poof said on TV that his miracle spring water,

19:46.080 --> 19:48.960
which he manufacture can produce miracles

19:48.960 --> 19:51.840
such as riches or cure health problems.

19:51.840 --> 19:53.920
The prophet sent me some of that water

19:53.920 --> 19:55.600
after I rout him a ladder.

19:56.400 --> 19:59.360
Do I pour it on Sammy or should he drink it?

19:59.360 --> 20:02.240
I want to ask the people who use this miracle water before.

20:04.320 --> 20:04.820
Peter.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.520
Here's one thing I can say pretty concretely.

20:07.520 --> 20:09.040
It will be equally effective.

20:10.320 --> 20:13.440
I also, just before we get into the discussion of the water,

20:13.440 --> 20:17.760
want to point out cats don't have their own access to butter.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.480
Like there is no problem where you're like,

20:20.480 --> 20:22.480
this cat just keeps getting butter

20:22.480 --> 20:23.840
and I don't know how to stop him.

20:23.840 --> 20:26.320
Where do you keep getting butter, Mr. Mittens?

20:26.320 --> 20:29.120
Mr. Mittens, you've been to the store once more.

20:29.120 --> 20:30.400
Same question I have about Garfield, right?

20:30.400 --> 20:33.120
Garfield clearly has an affinity for lasagna

20:33.120 --> 20:34.560
and you always see him in the strips.

20:34.560 --> 20:39.200
He's just got a big like fucking sweaty tray of lasagna there.

20:41.360 --> 20:43.440
John, did Arbuckle fucking give him that?

20:43.440 --> 20:46.960
Did he just bake a lasagna and then put it on the floor

20:46.960 --> 20:49.120
and say, here, let my cat eat this.

20:49.120 --> 20:51.760
You had to prepare that lasagna or go out to the store

20:51.760 --> 20:53.600
and purchase it pre-made, preheated.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.040
And then you get home from the store and you say,

20:55.040 --> 20:57.360
okay, cat time and you put that lasagna on the floor.

20:57.360 --> 20:57.920
What are you doing?

20:59.040 --> 21:02.400
Maybe Garfield signed up for some kind of like evil nature box

21:02.400 --> 21:05.120
where they just deliver lasagnas to his door.

21:05.120 --> 21:08.720
Can we talk about something related to this?

21:08.720 --> 21:09.200
Yeah, please.

21:09.200 --> 21:12.640
John Arbuckle is a single man living on his own.

21:12.640 --> 21:15.760
What is his, how is his thing going

21:15.760 --> 21:22.000
that he's like another big tray of lasagna just for me?

21:22.000 --> 21:22.640
Not for him though.

21:23.440 --> 21:23.840
Not for him.

21:23.840 --> 21:24.480
This is what I'm saying.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.560
He is consciously making the conscious decision

21:26.560 --> 21:28.640
to put lasagna on the floor for his cat to enjoy.

21:28.640 --> 21:31.280
Did he win some sort of fucking Stouffer's contest

21:31.280 --> 21:32.720
when he was 17 years old

21:32.720 --> 21:35.600
and now he gets free sweet zon for life?

21:35.600 --> 21:36.320
What's going on?

21:37.680 --> 21:38.800
It doesn't make any sense.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.400
Peter Pappouf, Miracle World.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.880
It's so optimistic though.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.600
By the time this lasagna goes bad,

21:47.600 --> 21:49.760
I might have met somebody to share it with.

21:49.760 --> 21:50.720
Yeah, that's the whole-

21:50.720 --> 21:51.920
Maybe that's his line.

21:51.920 --> 21:53.920
Maybe he goes to a bar and says like,

21:53.920 --> 21:56.320
hey, I got some lasagna at home.

21:57.200 --> 21:59.760
And then he gets home and that line,

21:59.760 --> 22:02.160
here's the worst part, that line always works

22:02.160 --> 22:03.440
and then he gets home, he's like,

22:03.440 --> 22:05.760
fuck, fuck the cat ate it again.

22:05.760 --> 22:07.760
Garfield, you cock blocked me again.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.240
Garfield, you cock blocked me again with your zon eating.

22:10.240 --> 22:12.240
I thought we were gonna eat lasagna.

22:12.240 --> 22:14.000
Nevermind, I'm leaving.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.520
Do you want me to go to Speedy Tony's

22:17.520 --> 22:19.040
all night lasagna button?

22:19.040 --> 22:20.080
No, I don't.

22:20.080 --> 22:23.920
I want the home-cooked zon that I was promised at the bar.

22:23.920 --> 22:26.080
Give me an hour, I'll make another one.

22:26.080 --> 22:28.480
No, that's an hour I don't have, John.

22:28.480 --> 22:30.400
We were gonna eat lasagna, fuck,

22:30.400 --> 22:31.280
and then I gotta go.

22:33.200 --> 22:36.240
She's like, fine, I'll give you one hour

22:36.240 --> 22:37.280
and then he makes it, he's like,

22:37.280 --> 22:38.720
oh, it's a little too hot.

22:38.720 --> 22:40.880
I'm gonna leave this out on the shelf to cool, babe,

22:40.880 --> 22:42.640
and then here in 20, we'll eat it.

22:42.640 --> 22:44.400
Oh, no, not again.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.080
I was trying to eat some hot lasagna,

22:46.080 --> 22:47.920
get some hot lasagna, fuck energy,

22:47.920 --> 22:49.440
and then I was gonna blow your mind.

22:50.240 --> 22:51.760
I needed the carbo load.

22:52.880 --> 22:55.840
Peter, poof, miracle water to cure obese cat.

22:55.840 --> 22:58.400
Are we talking about a topical solution

22:58.400 --> 22:59.680
or is this an analgesic?

23:01.280 --> 23:03.680
If there's one thing I know about little big kitties,

23:03.680 --> 23:05.680
they don't like to have water put on them.

23:05.680 --> 23:07.120
No, that is true.

23:07.120 --> 23:10.480
But I mean, it is a very obese cat.

23:10.480 --> 23:13.120
The funny thing about this miracle water

23:13.120 --> 23:15.440
is that if you dump the miracle water

23:15.440 --> 23:18.320
on top of the cat every time it tried to eat butter,

23:18.320 --> 23:19.520
it would probably work.

23:19.520 --> 23:22.000
Yeah, or anything.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.200
Anytime you try to do anything,

23:23.200 --> 23:24.960
if you spray it long enough, it'll get the hint,

23:24.960 --> 23:26.080
it'll get the net.

23:26.080 --> 23:28.320
Oh, no butter, okay, all right, I can dig it.

23:28.320 --> 23:29.760
Okay, so when I touch the butter, I get wet

23:29.760 --> 23:32.400
and I don't like that, so I guess butter's bad, cool.

23:33.520 --> 23:35.680
What if it's an enema situation?

23:35.680 --> 23:36.480
Oh, jeezers.

23:37.120 --> 23:39.040
No, I'm just saying all my butter is my enema.

23:39.040 --> 23:41.120
Yeah, what if the dude came out and was like,

23:41.120 --> 23:43.440
listen, I've invented a miracle water,

23:43.440 --> 23:47.680
and I swear to God it totally works.

23:47.680 --> 23:50.000
Promise, I promise it'll work.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.360
But you gotta put it in your butt.

23:53.040 --> 23:55.280
Do you think people would still be so gung-ho

23:55.280 --> 23:57.040
about trying the miracle water?

23:57.040 --> 24:00.480
Again, I think my arthritis in my wrist

24:00.480 --> 24:05.280
is getting really bad from all my typing and pro gaming,

24:05.280 --> 24:09.360
but if I put some water in my butt via an enema,

24:09.360 --> 24:12.080
I'll probably feel better, right?

24:12.080 --> 24:14.960
Not in my wrist, but I'll be a little cleaner

24:14.960 --> 24:16.080
down there, I think.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.960
So I think it'll still have, I think no matter what,

24:18.960 --> 24:20.560
you're gonna like how you feel.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.080
But how will you feel about butter?

24:23.040 --> 24:25.520
I don't think that, I'm fine with butter.

24:26.560 --> 24:28.400
What if every time your cat tries to eat butter,

24:28.400 --> 24:29.200
you give it an enema?

24:31.280 --> 24:32.800
That's effective training tool.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.400
I mean, it'll work.

24:34.400 --> 24:37.040
Ask Jackson Galaxy, that's his number one thing.

24:37.040 --> 24:38.960
Okay, cat won't stop scratching your couch.

24:39.760 --> 24:41.280
Here, let me get out my enema.

24:41.280 --> 24:42.400
I keep it in my guitar case.

24:42.400 --> 24:42.960
Let me get out.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.720
Oh, I see you've got, this is great.

24:44.720 --> 24:46.800
You've got a kiddie play place right by the window,

24:46.800 --> 24:48.800
so he's got lots of different levels to play on,

24:48.800 --> 24:50.080
lots of toys, great.

24:50.080 --> 24:52.480
How many enemas a day would you say you're doing?

24:53.680 --> 24:56.960
He does that, but Super Nanny tries to take that trick,

24:56.960 --> 24:58.000
and she goes to jail.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.840
And everybody gets so uptight.

24:59.840 --> 25:01.120
Double standard.

25:01.120 --> 25:03.600
Let me get out my Galaxy hose.

25:03.600 --> 25:04.320
That's what he calls.

25:05.040 --> 25:08.640
Do you guys ever think about the fact that Jackson Galaxy

25:09.200 --> 25:11.840
with his guitar case full of hoses

25:12.560 --> 25:14.640
and other cat training tools

25:14.640 --> 25:17.920
is basically the cat El Mariachi?

25:19.120 --> 25:19.600
Yeah.

25:19.600 --> 25:20.720
You ever think about that?

25:21.280 --> 25:22.960
He's basically El Mariachi

25:23.760 --> 25:27.520
from Robert Rodriguez fame before kiddies.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.280
Let me tell you the sad thing I think about

25:29.280 --> 25:31.440
every time I think about Jackson Galaxy.

25:31.440 --> 25:33.360
There had to have come a time

25:33.360 --> 25:36.640
when he looked at his guitar in his guitar case

25:36.640 --> 25:40.480
and said, I don't even need to bother with the guitar anymore.

25:40.480 --> 25:41.360
No, I've never heard him play.

25:41.360 --> 25:44.240
Like he made the decision to throw away the instrument

25:44.240 --> 25:46.160
and just fill it with cat shit.

25:46.160 --> 25:47.600
Yeah, he's so, he's-

25:47.600 --> 25:48.560
Brainstorm.

25:48.560 --> 25:48.960
Oh gosh.

25:48.960 --> 25:49.840
Excuse me, guys.

25:51.280 --> 25:53.280
If we reach 4,000 donors,

25:54.000 --> 25:56.240
can we do one of our bonus episodes

25:56.240 --> 25:59.360
be with special guestpert Jackson Galaxy?

25:59.360 --> 26:00.480
Do you think he'd come on the show?

26:00.480 --> 26:02.000
I feel like we've always been pretty nice.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.920
I don't know that's a hundred percent true.

26:04.480 --> 26:06.640
Nobody's got to listen to all the back episodes, right?

26:06.640 --> 26:09.600
Yeah, I don't think he would vet us especially hard.

26:10.400 --> 26:13.600
If, if, if, if we do one of our bonus episodes

26:13.600 --> 26:15.280
I think should be just like a night

26:15.280 --> 26:18.160
of all the stars we can get on our podcast.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.360
All guests spreading at the same time.

26:19.360 --> 26:22.800
So fucking Jackson Galaxy, Scott Bakula, Scott Dracula.

26:22.800 --> 26:29.760
Scott Bakula is, we've had a 100% success rate

26:29.760 --> 26:31.840
with attempting to get people on our program.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.680
The only person who's ever said no is,

26:33.680 --> 26:35.120
is Scott Bakula's people.

26:36.240 --> 26:37.520
It hurts, hurts to this day.

26:37.520 --> 26:38.800
He's our white whale.

26:38.800 --> 26:39.920
Did not have the time.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.400
I'll get you Scott Bakula.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.480
What if we just keep emailing him every month

26:44.480 --> 26:45.680
and pretend like it's the first time

26:45.680 --> 26:46.640
you've ever reached out to him?

26:47.520 --> 26:49.200
Just checking with that schedule again.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

26:50.480 --> 26:51.600
I'm saying reach out to him.

26:51.600 --> 26:53.840
Say, hi, Scott, we have an exciting opportunity for you.

26:53.840 --> 26:54.480
Do you like advice?

26:54.480 --> 26:55.280
Do you like podcasts?

26:55.280 --> 26:57.360
You want to reach out to our 35 million listeners?

26:57.360 --> 26:58.640
Well, we have an opportunity for you.

26:58.640 --> 26:59.680
It's called My Brother, My Brother and Me.

26:59.680 --> 27:00.240
You want to be on it?

27:00.240 --> 27:02.320
And he says, no, no, no, no.

27:02.320 --> 27:03.440
I'm doing CSI New Orleans.

27:03.440 --> 27:05.760
Like I don't need your help with my career anymore.

27:06.400 --> 27:06.960
And we say, okay.

27:06.960 --> 27:08.640
We did miss that window though, didn't we?

27:08.640 --> 27:09.520
Can we all agree on that?

27:09.520 --> 27:11.200
We absolutely missed that window.

27:11.200 --> 27:12.800
By just a few months too, which is the frustrating thing.

27:12.800 --> 27:14.160
I'm saying the month after that we say,

27:14.160 --> 27:15.200
hi, Scott Bakula.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.160
My name is Griffin McElroy.

27:16.160 --> 27:17.680
I'm from a podcast called My Brother, My Brother and Me.

27:17.680 --> 27:21.680
We have an exciting opportunity for you and either we will get him on the show by tricking him

27:21.680 --> 27:23.840
or we will make him think he's gone insane.

27:25.200 --> 27:29.680
If we hit 4,000 donors, I can guarantee that we will gaslight Scott Bakula.

27:29.680 --> 27:30.160
Absolutely.

27:30.160 --> 27:30.960
We're not going to do that.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.120
We're not going to do that to Scott Bakula.

27:34.080 --> 27:35.680
We will gaslight him right into our hearts.

27:35.680 --> 27:39.040
If we get to 4,000 donors, we will learn how to pronounce that dude's last name.

27:39.600 --> 27:40.480
I promise.

27:40.480 --> 27:43.280
I got another question here, Travis, but it's so long.

27:43.280 --> 27:44.400
Do I really have to read all of this?

27:44.400 --> 27:45.200
It's a good one.

27:46.160 --> 27:46.480
Okay.

27:46.480 --> 27:48.160
It's very, it's a rich vein.

27:48.160 --> 27:49.600
This is on you, okay?

27:49.600 --> 27:50.080
Okay.

27:50.080 --> 27:51.280
Do you want me to read it?

27:51.280 --> 27:51.840
No.

27:51.840 --> 27:52.560
Justin, you got it.

27:52.560 --> 27:52.960
No.

27:52.960 --> 27:54.880
I don't want to break tradition here.

27:54.880 --> 27:55.380
Okay.

27:56.560 --> 28:03.040
Recently, I helped my friend, she's also a bambino, move into a new apartment where he

28:03.040 --> 28:04.720
will be living with a classmate of ours.

28:04.720 --> 28:05.600
Let's call her Cheryl.

28:06.400 --> 28:11.120
My friend didn't have that much stuff to move, but no, really like one trip in a Toyota RAV4.

28:11.120 --> 28:17.280
However, Cheryl had a big moving truck, my RAV4, and multiple trips of her civic worth

28:17.280 --> 28:17.780
of stuff.

28:18.400 --> 28:19.520
Here is where the problem lies.

28:19.520 --> 28:24.480
She asked me if I would help since I was already helping my friend move in, and she would quote,

28:24.480 --> 28:25.440
get us pizza?

28:26.000 --> 28:29.280
After a couple of hours moving her stuff out of her old place, her and her boyfriend started

28:29.280 --> 28:34.480
eating cold pizza for the night before and offered us some, which we ate like manbees,

28:34.480 --> 28:38.400
one slice each, and we were both around 250 pounds.

28:38.400 --> 28:41.120
We then moved all of our stuff to the new apartment.

28:41.120 --> 28:45.040
She invited my friend and me to lunch at an Applebee's-like establishment.

28:45.040 --> 28:47.600
There is no place like the Bee's, but moving on.

28:47.600 --> 28:52.480
Even when we sat down, she said something about buying, but when the checks came, she

28:52.480 --> 28:55.760
had them split, and we each had to pay for our own lunches.

28:56.400 --> 28:57.600
I'm right in the middle of being annoyed.

28:57.600 --> 28:58.880
I'm right for being annoyed, right?

28:59.440 --> 29:04.320
Or was the cold pizza that I get, you know, caveat emptor, and inviting us to lunch was

29:04.320 --> 29:07.360
just because we were there when they were making plans.

29:07.360 --> 29:10.720
That's from contemplating contractual compensation in Concord.

29:10.720 --> 29:12.560
That is a really good name.

29:12.560 --> 29:14.560
Oh my God, though.

29:15.200 --> 29:19.360
I would go into the person's house and start moving them out.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.880
I would walk back out the door and just start carrying things out.

29:22.880 --> 29:24.480
And where are you going with my TV?

29:24.480 --> 29:24.880
I don't know.

29:24.880 --> 29:26.240
Where are you going with my pizza promise?

29:26.240 --> 29:29.200
It's being repossessed because you're terrible.

29:29.200 --> 29:30.880
You're late on your pizza dues.

29:30.880 --> 29:38.000
By tricking you into eating garbage pizza, this person has pulled a goddamn mother goose

29:38.000 --> 29:39.920
bridge troll trick on you.

29:39.920 --> 29:44.800
Oh yeah, this is definitely where you're looking at a nursery rhyme scenario.

29:44.800 --> 29:52.240
Is this person some sort of nymph of the forest who is trying to trick you into giving her

29:52.240 --> 29:54.080
your son or daughter?

29:54.080 --> 29:57.600
Oh, you've fallen for my pizza conundrum.

29:57.600 --> 30:02.960
Right, by eating that cold pizza on the wrong side of the river sticks, you are now officially

30:02.960 --> 30:04.000
Haiti's concubine.

30:05.200 --> 30:08.400
I think that's the kind of situation that you've gotten into where they've pulled a

30:08.400 --> 30:09.200
food trick on you.

30:10.160 --> 30:11.440
What a goddamn disaster.

30:11.440 --> 30:18.960
I can't imagine going to fucking town at an Applebee's establishment and just going crazy

30:19.600 --> 30:23.680
on appetizers, like having four different appetizers, two different entrees, and six

30:23.680 --> 30:26.160
desserts thinking this is the best day of my goddamn life.

30:26.160 --> 30:31.120
There is nothing that makes a Southwest quesadilla steak tower taste better than knowing someone

30:31.120 --> 30:32.480
else is picking up the tab.

30:32.480 --> 30:35.680
And then you get that tab and all of a sudden the food turns rotten.

30:36.240 --> 30:39.040
The fields in your tummy turn fallow.

30:40.800 --> 30:45.360
I cannot even imagine getting the fucking rug pulled out from under me.

30:45.360 --> 30:49.200
You should be on like a fucking 60 minute special with this story.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.760
This is some rescue 911 shit.

30:51.760 --> 30:52.640
This is garbage.

30:53.200 --> 30:53.920
This is the worst.

30:53.920 --> 30:58.080
This is what that show The Jinx was about, some guy who did this to some of his friends.

30:58.080 --> 30:59.040
What did I do?

30:59.040 --> 31:01.440
Tricked them all into eating cold pizza.

31:02.480 --> 31:06.560
They carried my futon up the stairs and then I crushed their dreams.

31:06.560 --> 31:07.680
I have not seen the show.

31:07.680 --> 31:10.240
Were we just being incredibly insensitive about a true life crime story?

31:10.240 --> 31:10.640
Don't know.

31:10.640 --> 31:11.520
Haven't seen the show either.

31:11.520 --> 31:12.400
Haven't seen the show.

31:13.040 --> 31:16.080
Probably being very insensitive about a true life crime story though.

31:16.080 --> 31:17.680
Never seen the show myself.

31:17.680 --> 31:19.360
Your first mistake.

31:19.360 --> 31:20.480
Good reference, everybody.

31:21.520 --> 31:22.480
Just around the horn.

31:22.480 --> 31:23.920
Super cool job, the three of us.

31:23.920 --> 31:26.000
We did a real good job.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.440
We knew there was a cultural touchstone we hadn't mentioned yet.

31:29.440 --> 31:31.840
Didn't have any other info, but we went for it.

31:31.840 --> 31:35.040
We skipped a stone, crossed the surface of it, and let it be.

31:35.600 --> 31:39.040
Next up, some great goofs about the works of Flo Bear.

31:39.040 --> 31:42.800
Another topic which we're well equipped to.

31:42.800 --> 31:47.520
Your mistake, of course, was agreeing to help this person move.

31:47.520 --> 31:47.920
What?

31:48.880 --> 31:49.200
No.

31:49.840 --> 31:50.880
Absolutely not.

31:50.880 --> 31:52.080
There's no, there's no.

31:52.080 --> 31:52.880
Okay, listen.

31:53.520 --> 31:58.320
The only reason that you would agree to help a stranger move and they offered you pizza

31:58.320 --> 32:01.120
is that you don't know how to get pizza other ways.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.520
And that's, that's pretty sad and scary to me.

32:03.520 --> 32:04.320
Now, Justin.

32:05.120 --> 32:05.920
Travis.

32:05.920 --> 32:07.760
I'm going to contradict you here.

32:08.320 --> 32:08.640
Whoa.

32:09.360 --> 32:10.880
First, I'm a bim bam first.

32:11.680 --> 32:16.000
The problem is this stranger is moving in with a friend of yours.

32:16.720 --> 32:21.200
So you're going to, I could see that this helping them move as an investment in

32:21.200 --> 32:24.800
future friendship because it's like we're going to be hanging out at this

32:24.800 --> 32:27.760
apartment with our buddy who were actually there to help move.

32:27.760 --> 32:29.680
They're investing in future friends.

32:29.680 --> 32:33.360
Travis, they're friends that I distance myself from because I suspect they might

32:33.360 --> 32:35.120
want to move in the next six months.

32:35.120 --> 32:35.840
Are you kidding?

32:35.840 --> 32:38.800
This is the only reason people make friends.

32:38.800 --> 32:40.480
The debt's already been paid.

32:40.480 --> 32:44.480
There's no reason to pursue a friendship if you already helped the person move.

32:45.600 --> 32:46.480
Are you crazy?

32:46.480 --> 32:49.280
You're saying that this is your, like you helped this dude move and he's never going

32:49.280 --> 32:50.240
to speak to you again.

32:50.240 --> 32:50.960
Travis.

32:50.960 --> 32:51.360
Right.

32:51.360 --> 32:51.520
Yeah.

32:51.520 --> 32:53.040
This is the end game for friendship.

32:53.040 --> 32:53.280
Travis.

32:53.280 --> 32:53.520
Yeah.

32:53.520 --> 32:56.480
Well, you're definitely never going to speak to him again because he lives with

32:56.480 --> 32:57.600
just a food monster.

32:57.600 --> 32:57.920
Travis.

32:57.920 --> 32:58.240
Yeah.

32:58.240 --> 33:00.000
Some sort of pizza warlock.

33:01.600 --> 33:02.640
This thing sucks.

33:02.640 --> 33:05.920
And if you want to press charges, I can put you in contact with my people.

33:05.920 --> 33:06.560
Travis.

33:06.560 --> 33:11.360
You should contact Judge John Hodgeman right this second and make this happen.

33:11.360 --> 33:11.760
Travis.

33:11.760 --> 33:12.880
This is a huge issue.

33:12.880 --> 33:13.280
Travis.

33:13.280 --> 33:14.640
Contact Judge John Judy.

33:14.640 --> 33:15.440
Travis.

33:15.440 --> 33:19.440
I'm so livid about this that I can't actually advise this, but it's very upsetting.

33:19.440 --> 33:19.520
Travis.

33:19.520 --> 33:20.320
Let's take that anger-

33:20.320 --> 33:21.280
I would throw their stuff out the window.

33:21.280 --> 33:21.360
Travis.

33:21.360 --> 33:23.840
Let's take that anger and let's channel it into asking people for money.

33:23.840 --> 33:24.160
Travis.

33:24.160 --> 33:28.800
Listen, I've distanced myself from everybody who would help me move and I have no money

33:28.800 --> 33:30.000
to hire movers.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.040
And that's where you come in.

33:31.040 --> 33:31.120
Travis.

33:31.120 --> 33:32.320
You are moving very soon.

33:32.320 --> 33:32.640
Travis.

33:32.640 --> 33:33.760
You're all part of the plan.

33:33.760 --> 33:33.920
Travis.

33:33.920 --> 33:35.120
You haven't even thought about this, Justin.

33:35.120 --> 33:36.320
You're moving very soon.

33:36.320 --> 33:36.720
Travis.

33:36.720 --> 33:38.240
Yeah, and I'm out of options.

33:38.240 --> 33:38.640
I have no options left.

33:38.640 --> 33:38.640
Travis.

33:38.640 --> 33:42.720
You've been fucking paying it backward for a decade now.

33:42.720 --> 33:43.040
Travis.

33:43.040 --> 33:47.760
I was trying to get my baby to do curls this week so maybe she could cut, carry, I don't

33:47.760 --> 33:50.080
know, a pillow, a scarf, something to help.

33:50.080 --> 33:51.520
Travis.

33:51.520 --> 33:57.360
You've been getting three people to do you a favor that you do nothing about after that

33:57.360 --> 33:58.400
and it dies with you.

33:58.400 --> 33:59.680
You've been paying it backward.

33:59.680 --> 34:01.280
Travis, tell us about the Max Fund Drive.

34:01.280 --> 34:01.840
Travis.

34:01.840 --> 34:02.640
Okay.

34:02.640 --> 34:03.120
Here's the thing.

34:03.120 --> 34:06.960
Let's assume, I'm going to assume for the sake of this pledge break, that this is the

34:06.960 --> 34:09.920
first episode of My Brother, My Brother and Me you've ever listened to.

34:09.920 --> 34:11.920
Maybe even your first podcast.

34:11.920 --> 34:13.120
So here's what you need to know.

34:13.120 --> 34:14.320
Here are the basics.

34:14.320 --> 34:19.600
Maximumfun.org is a donor-supported network, which means that we rely heavily on the support

34:19.600 --> 34:24.640
of listeners like you and your friends to help make the awesome shows on Maximumfun.org

34:24.640 --> 34:25.120
possible.

34:27.200 --> 34:29.120
It's not just money to pay the hosts.

34:29.120 --> 34:30.720
It goes to pay production costs.

34:30.720 --> 34:35.520
It goes to pay to keep the lights on at Max Fund HQ, to put new shows on the network,

34:35.520 --> 34:38.160
and to help us grow our show.

34:38.160 --> 34:42.720
Since last Fund Drive, we've added two new shows to the network that were just McRoy

34:42.720 --> 34:46.800
based, and we've added others that you should listen to now if you haven't yet.

34:46.800 --> 34:50.320
But new shows are created because of support from listeners like you.

34:50.320 --> 34:56.640
So how it works is, once a year, we ask you to commit to making monthly donations.

34:56.640 --> 35:02.800
So every month, that will automatically come out of your bank account to help us support

35:02.800 --> 35:03.840
Max Fund.

35:03.840 --> 35:10.960
And support us, like paying for hosting fees and upfront travel costs and stuff for when

35:10.960 --> 35:15.280
we do shows, tours, like we're doing in shit, like 11 days.

35:15.280 --> 35:16.480
God, very soon, we're hitting the road.

35:16.480 --> 35:21.200
I mean, that's the awesome thing is the money that you donate goes to what you care

35:21.200 --> 35:21.520
about.

35:21.520 --> 35:24.160
It goes to the shows that you love and the shows that you listen to.

35:24.880 --> 35:30.240
And from what I found, and don't quote me on this, but that's not very normal.

35:30.240 --> 35:32.400
That's very unique to Max Fund.

35:32.400 --> 35:33.360
Yeah, it's a special thing.

35:33.360 --> 35:34.720
You're supporting us directly.

35:35.760 --> 35:40.560
Tell the people what they will get for giving us monthly donations at whatever level they

35:40.560 --> 35:41.440
feel comfy with.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.040
Well, I can say this.

35:43.040 --> 35:44.880
Across the board, there's different levels.

35:44.880 --> 35:51.120
But the main thing that you get is, one, our gratitude, and two, a feeling of ownership

35:51.120 --> 35:54.400
and membership in the maximumfund.org family.

35:54.400 --> 36:00.160
But not only that, you also get real shit, too, like quantifiable shit.

36:00.160 --> 36:05.680
For $5 a month, you get access to exclusive donors-only bonus content.

36:06.480 --> 36:09.360
And not just for this year, for all the past years.

36:09.360 --> 36:13.280
So there's like years and years and years and years of bonus content.

36:13.280 --> 36:16.480
Justin did the math, and it's like days and days of content.

36:16.480 --> 36:21.760
I want to say there's like five bonus bim-bams on there at this point.

36:21.760 --> 36:23.120
Oh, at least.

36:23.120 --> 36:23.680
Oh, yeah.

36:23.680 --> 36:31.120
I mean, if you like my brother, my brother, and me, and you donate at least five bucks

36:31.120 --> 36:36.240
a month to this year's drive, you donate five bucks a month.

36:36.240 --> 36:40.720
You will get a live from my brother, my brother, and me recorded at San Francisco Sketch Fest.

36:41.360 --> 36:46.720
The world's only episode of the extant episode that's not on the deep web of Big Gulp

36:46.720 --> 36:48.320
recorded in Los Angeles.

36:48.320 --> 36:57.520
A demo of Fugue for Brother Horns performed by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the author of the hip

36:57.520 --> 37:02.720
musical Hamilton, who also did a parody of Fugue for Tin Horns from Guys and Dolls.

37:04.160 --> 37:05.440
He's a Tony Award winner, folks.

37:05.440 --> 37:07.920
We spared no expense.

37:07.920 --> 37:13.520
He got the, as we reminded him recently, he's got the IGT, and he is so close to the I.

37:13.520 --> 37:16.560
And if you donate to Maximum Fun, you could help him win that Oscar.

37:17.200 --> 37:18.560
Get him that Oscar.

37:18.560 --> 37:21.680
2014, my brother, my brother, and me bonus episode.

37:21.680 --> 37:26.240
2013, 2012, there's another one from 2012 for Maximum Fun Day.

37:26.240 --> 37:31.520
2011, there's two riff videos that we did of public service announcements.

37:31.520 --> 37:35.760
There's 15 minutes of live bim bam from Austin in 2012.

37:35.760 --> 37:37.520
It's mind-boggling.

37:37.520 --> 37:41.360
And then there is a 45-minute prequel episode of The Adventure Zone, which is one of my

37:41.360 --> 37:42.720
favorite things we've ever recorded.

37:43.440 --> 37:44.720
There's how many saw bones?

37:46.560 --> 37:47.520
Two or three?

37:47.520 --> 37:48.560
Two or one?

37:49.200 --> 37:50.000
One, two, or three.

37:50.880 --> 37:52.160
Two bonus saw bones.

37:52.160 --> 37:52.800
There's a bonus.

37:52.800 --> 37:57.040
Oh, and the bonus saw bones for this year is a full-length commentary for the finale

37:57.040 --> 37:57.920
of Two and a Half Men.

37:58.560 --> 37:59.040
Suck it.

37:59.040 --> 37:59.440
Perfect.

37:59.440 --> 38:00.560
Perfect.

38:00.560 --> 38:01.760
There's a bonus bunker buddy.

38:01.760 --> 38:03.040
There's bonus episode.

38:03.040 --> 38:04.560
There's fucking a lot.

38:04.560 --> 38:05.520
If you like Jordan and Jesse, go.

38:05.520 --> 38:09.040
I can't even imagine how many bonus episodes of that show are available.

38:09.040 --> 38:10.720
And that's just for $5 a month.

38:10.720 --> 38:13.040
So that's so much.

38:13.760 --> 38:19.120
And so for $10 a month, you get that and a driving exclusive tote bag that you're only

38:19.120 --> 38:21.120
going to be able to get during Max Fun Drive.

38:22.320 --> 38:26.480
And then for $20 a month, you get the tote bag, you get the bonus content, and you get

38:26.480 --> 38:30.640
an in-flight power pack that contains a mobile device charger, a collapsible water bottle,

38:30.640 --> 38:33.520
antibacterial wipes, and pilot wings.

38:34.560 --> 38:39.840
For $35 a month, you get all of that and a pair of rocket-engraved shot glasses.

38:39.840 --> 38:43.120
Now, I've got the tumblers and they are beautiful.

38:43.120 --> 38:46.240
So trust me, you're going to want these shot glasses.

38:46.240 --> 38:49.440
Now, say you've got a little bit more and you're looking to give at a higher level.

38:49.440 --> 38:54.560
Well, for $100 a month, you get everything from the previous levels and you become a

38:54.560 --> 38:56.960
member in the inner circle, our monthly culture club.

38:56.960 --> 39:04.080
And how that works is once a month, a Max Fun host or a Max Fun employee will pick some

39:04.080 --> 39:07.440
kind of cultural thing and they will ship it to you.

39:07.440 --> 39:11.360
It could be a movie, it could be, you know, an album.

39:11.360 --> 39:15.520
It could be the album Music Evolution by the awesome band Buckshot Lafonque, which is what

39:15.520 --> 39:16.800
we sent all of the-

39:16.800 --> 39:18.320
It likely won't be that again.

39:18.320 --> 39:18.960
I would bet.

39:18.960 --> 39:19.760
Probably not.

39:19.760 --> 39:22.720
This time it will be their self-titled album, Buckshot Lafonque.

39:22.720 --> 39:28.000
And they'll send you a note telling you all about it and send you either a physical copy

39:28.000 --> 39:30.480
or a download code or something that you can get a hold of it.

39:30.480 --> 39:32.320
Now, say you want to do $200 a month.

39:32.320 --> 39:33.120
Holy shit.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.320
One, I love you so much.

39:36.320 --> 39:39.360
That's where we are at with our billions now.

39:39.360 --> 39:45.280
Yes, you get everything else from all the other levels plus free registration to Max

39:45.280 --> 39:46.960
Fun Con 2016.

39:46.960 --> 39:52.400
Let me tell you, this is not only great because it makes good financial sense, but two,

39:52.400 --> 39:55.280
that shit sells out so quickly.

39:55.280 --> 39:56.400
You don't even have to worry about it.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.440
Take a nap on ticket sale day.

39:59.440 --> 40:00.800
Take a dirt nap.

40:00.800 --> 40:01.520
Well, don't do that.

40:02.240 --> 40:03.280
Just take a long nap.

40:03.280 --> 40:06.320
Oh, and not only that, so those are all the levels.

40:06.320 --> 40:07.120
You should do that.

40:07.120 --> 40:09.280
Find the level that's right for you and do that.

40:09.280 --> 40:14.560
But also there's a special competition going on right now that if you tweet using the hashtag

40:14.560 --> 40:19.280
Max Fun Drive, you're automatically entered in the contest that if your tweet is picked

40:19.280 --> 40:23.600
as the best tweet, you win a free ticket to Max Fun Con 2015.

40:23.600 --> 40:24.960
Holy crap.

40:24.960 --> 40:27.840
Which is already sold out, has been sold out for months.

40:27.840 --> 40:29.920
So there's a lot of different things you can get for donating.

40:29.920 --> 40:35.520
We also have challenge donors who, for every new donor that we get, will kick in a certain

40:35.520 --> 40:37.200
amount of cash and all of those.

40:37.200 --> 40:39.280
There's a bunch of them at this point and they all add up.

40:39.280 --> 40:42.960
So if you're a new donor, then we get another chunk of change from them.

40:42.960 --> 40:48.480
And also, if you are an existing donor, you can get these pledge gifts if you upgrade

40:48.480 --> 40:49.520
your donation.

40:49.520 --> 40:53.360
The cool thing about this, a lot of times if you donate to a group or organization,

40:53.360 --> 40:56.320
it's hard to tell exactly where the money is going.

40:56.320 --> 41:02.320
With the Max Fun Drive, 70% of your donation goes directly to the shows that you say you

41:02.320 --> 41:03.120
listen to.

41:03.120 --> 41:08.880
It's your, 70% of your pledge is, 30% goes to help run the network and there's a lot

41:08.880 --> 41:12.640
of overhead with running a podcast network, believe you me.

41:12.640 --> 41:18.480
But 70% of your donation goes straight to the shows that you listen to.

41:18.480 --> 41:23.200
You are directly supporting them and that's pretty great.

41:23.200 --> 41:24.560
The key is to not wait.

41:24.560 --> 41:27.440
There's no reason to wait if you're thinking about it now and you're like, you know what?

41:27.440 --> 41:29.280
I do want to support the shows I listen to.

41:29.280 --> 41:30.800
I want to support the shows I love.

41:31.680 --> 41:35.520
I've got a little bit extra in my budget and I want to do it.

41:35.520 --> 41:40.240
Then go now, maximumfun.org forward slash donate while you're thinking about it.

41:40.240 --> 41:43.840
Don't wait because there's only, by the time this comes out, a couple days left in the

41:43.840 --> 41:46.800
Max Fun Drive and you don't want to miss out on these great gifts.

41:46.800 --> 41:49.760
You don't want to miss out on our gratitude and you want to get caught up in the action

41:49.760 --> 41:50.640
of Max Fun Drive.

41:50.640 --> 41:56.080
Help us hit that 4,000 donor goal and get all of the other bonus content that could

41:56.080 --> 41:57.680
exist if we do that.

41:57.680 --> 41:58.480
Just sail away.

41:59.200 --> 42:00.400
Come sail away with us.

42:00.400 --> 42:01.920
Wait, can you give me the address one more time?

42:01.920 --> 42:03.600
I didn't get a chance to write it down.

42:03.600 --> 42:08.480
It's maximumfun.org forward slash donate and then tweet at us so we can thank you.

42:08.480 --> 42:12.000
After you're done donating, take your game and recognize the game of Rachel Sperling

42:12.640 --> 42:13.840
who sent in this Yahoo answer.

42:13.840 --> 42:14.560
Thank you, Rachel Sperling.

42:14.560 --> 42:15.760
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

42:16.320 --> 42:17.360
They are anonymous.

42:18.960 --> 42:19.840
The group?

42:19.840 --> 42:20.160
Yep.

42:20.880 --> 42:24.400
They said, President Obama, your secrets.

42:24.400 --> 42:30.160
No, they said, is there any science to a nerdgasm?

42:32.160 --> 42:35.120
Okay, so I was watching The Flash.

42:35.120 --> 42:44.640
Major spoilers for The Flash and then there's a big spoiler for The Flash here and I'm

42:44.640 --> 42:46.880
going to leave it out because I assume that some people listen.

42:46.880 --> 42:48.880
Is it that he runs really fast?

42:48.880 --> 42:54.320
Yeah, he runs really fast and when I found that out, okay, end of spoiler, I had a crazy

42:54.320 --> 42:55.280
nerdgasm.

42:55.280 --> 42:56.720
It felt so real.

42:56.720 --> 43:00.080
I was wondering if there's any science or research supporting this.

43:00.640 --> 43:03.360
I'm sorry, it felt so real?

43:03.360 --> 43:08.720
Yeah, I saw him run so fast and I just blew a huge one.

43:08.720 --> 43:09.120
What?

43:09.120 --> 43:10.640
It felt so real?

43:10.640 --> 43:15.520
You produced a spumy fluid?

43:16.400 --> 43:20.080
Do people never think about what they're putting out into the internet?

43:20.880 --> 43:25.120
The implied addendum to it felt so real is it felt so real, I bet.

43:25.840 --> 43:26.320
I bet.

43:28.320 --> 43:30.400
Compared to the real orgasms I've had.

43:30.400 --> 43:31.520
It was so real.

43:31.520 --> 43:34.480
I'm just wondering if there's any science or research supporting this.

43:35.280 --> 43:40.720
I mean our scientific complex, our American scientific complex is so crazy corrupt, hello

43:40.720 --> 43:44.720
global warming, that I wouldn't put it past us that we're probably spending, probably

43:44.720 --> 43:51.760
subsidizing billions of my taxpayer dollars to pay for scientists to watch episodes of

43:51.760 --> 43:54.960
The Flash and then there's a control group that's just jerking off.

43:54.960 --> 44:00.800
Isn't, isn't a nergasm just like, I got really excited to see a thing that I like.

44:00.800 --> 44:04.080
And I, and I jizzed real jizz.

44:04.080 --> 44:09.760
Has, has anyone ever thought that that's what a nergasm really meant?

44:09.760 --> 44:19.120
I think that we as a society are doing something now that we should have done many years ago

44:19.120 --> 44:23.440
and officially retiring the phrase nergasm from the popular vernacular.

44:23.440 --> 44:23.840
Yes.

44:23.840 --> 44:29.840
Once someone thinks that they have experienced this thing that lazy bloggers made up probably.

44:29.840 --> 44:30.560
Yeah.

44:30.560 --> 44:35.680
Once you've, once you have people thinking they've experienced this phenomenon that is

44:35.680 --> 44:40.080
made up and not real, then it's probably time, it's probably gotten reckless.

44:40.080 --> 44:43.280
I mean it's, it's just a portmanteau, people.

44:43.280 --> 44:45.760
Or is it a real scientific phenomenon?

44:45.760 --> 44:47.360
Welcome to San Diego Comic Con.

44:47.360 --> 44:48.560
Here is a mop and bucket.

44:48.560 --> 44:49.600
We're gonna need you to chip in.

44:50.400 --> 44:52.000
If, oh my god, the Firefly panel.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.080
If he sees something, mop something.

44:54.080 --> 44:54.640
Yeah.

44:54.640 --> 45:00.240
At the Firefly panel, we had to put down fucking plastic sheets everywhere that you will be

45:00.240 --> 45:02.480
waiting out of the Firefly panel.

45:02.480 --> 45:03.680
It's a disaster in there.

45:03.680 --> 45:05.600
It's a biological hazard.

45:05.600 --> 45:09.280
He said I came to misbehave and you could literally see it coming out the window.

45:09.280 --> 45:09.600
Right.

45:09.600 --> 45:10.480
It's really, really bad.

45:10.480 --> 45:12.160
A lot of those people just came to came.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.600
It's really, really bad.

45:15.600 --> 45:19.280
This has been a very bad run of sentences that we've had.

45:19.280 --> 45:20.960
A lot of really upsetting.

45:20.960 --> 45:23.280
A lot of very challenging concepts.

45:23.280 --> 45:28.320
But don't you think that this is a like a bigger indication of the issue of like people

45:28.320 --> 45:33.840
not understanding what a referent, like when someone says something like, oh yeah, I had

45:33.840 --> 45:35.120
a total nerdgasm.

45:35.120 --> 45:39.200
That there's some small portion of people that go, what is that?

45:39.200 --> 45:39.680
And I'm not gonna ask.

45:39.680 --> 45:43.600
Or maybe we're just like being pretty fucking reckless with language.

45:43.600 --> 45:48.080
Maybe if we're gonna say something, it should mean that like this, this question asker is

45:48.080 --> 45:50.880
a kind of adult, but they raise a fine point.

45:50.880 --> 45:56.320
Like if this doesn't exist, if you can't have a nerd, if you can't have a scientific verifiable

45:56.320 --> 45:58.560
nerdgasm, maybe it shouldn't be a thing.

45:58.560 --> 46:00.880
Maybe don't like so flip it with language.

46:00.880 --> 46:01.200
Yeah.

46:01.760 --> 46:05.120
Why don't you just say pleasurable, pleasurable sensation?

46:05.120 --> 46:07.040
I got really excited.

46:07.040 --> 46:08.640
Or just like, okay.

46:08.640 --> 46:12.240
I was watching the flash and I ejaculated for some reason.

46:12.240 --> 46:15.040
And I guess that ejaculated for a solid 20 minutes.

46:15.040 --> 46:17.840
Not the first two, because I totally saw that coming.

46:17.840 --> 46:25.600
But then after the first two minutes, it was a solid like 20 minutes of like a slow orgasm.

46:26.400 --> 46:27.280
And then I died.

46:30.480 --> 46:31.920
So yeah, it's probably a real thing, right?

46:32.960 --> 46:33.920
That's where we all land.

46:33.920 --> 46:36.960
I haven't been paying attention for the past 10 minutes, but I think that's where we all

46:36.960 --> 46:37.280
landed.

46:38.480 --> 46:39.680
I mean, I could say this.

46:39.680 --> 46:46.240
I watched the Avengers trailer and I saw a flash of vision at the end and I ruined three

46:46.240 --> 46:47.280
pairs of pants.

46:47.280 --> 46:51.760
Yeah, I actually, I didn't because I haven't been able to have a nerdgasm for the past

46:51.760 --> 46:52.640
couple of years.

46:52.640 --> 46:52.960
Yeah.

46:53.920 --> 46:55.520
That's so hard to say that.

46:55.520 --> 47:00.560
I've been taking like nerd hormone therapy to try and get my stuff right.

47:00.560 --> 47:05.040
And frankly, this is the bravest I've ever felt just sort of talking about it.

47:05.040 --> 47:06.560
It's just nothing does it for me anymore.

47:06.560 --> 47:11.280
I guess when would you say that like you was the last my last nerdgasm?

47:12.320 --> 47:12.960
That's tough.

47:12.960 --> 47:20.560
I remember after seeing Iron Man 2, a movie that Iron Man was not in, and I just sort

47:20.560 --> 47:23.200
of dried up down there after just walking out of the theater.

47:23.200 --> 47:25.200
I just sort of, it just sort of went fallow.

47:26.400 --> 47:30.720
Brothers, I work at a very large company with a very lax dress code.

47:31.280 --> 47:32.640
Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait.

47:32.640 --> 47:33.680
This reminds me of something.

47:33.680 --> 47:34.160
What's that?

47:35.040 --> 47:40.320
A great tweet we got yesterday from, did you guys see this?

47:40.320 --> 47:41.920
From Terry Gross apologizing?

47:41.920 --> 47:45.760
Saying, I'm sorry for chomping your flame for so many years.

47:45.760 --> 47:51.840
No, we got a tweet about somebody who works.

47:52.400 --> 47:55.680
It's from somebody who works in the FCC building.

47:55.680 --> 47:56.560
Oh, yeah.

47:56.560 --> 47:58.400
Or like somewhere adjacent.

47:58.400 --> 47:58.800
I don't know.

47:58.800 --> 48:02.560
They're in the same complex as the FCC.

48:03.200 --> 48:08.000
And they ended up in an elevator with the chairman of the FCC.

48:08.000 --> 48:12.160
And this happened to them twice.

48:13.760 --> 48:19.680
And he gave the FCC chair a plug from a bim bam, trying to explain what the show was he

48:19.680 --> 48:23.520
was listening to on his phone, I guess without headphones or what have you.

48:23.520 --> 48:30.000
And after explaining the premise, the chairman of the FCC said, oh, it's like click and

48:30.000 --> 48:31.760
clack for the modern generation.

48:31.760 --> 48:37.360
That is the most flattering thing that anybody has ever said about our show.

48:37.360 --> 48:41.200
Unfortunately, the next day, the FCC did crack down on podcasts.

48:41.200 --> 48:42.400
And now we're all being fine.

48:42.400 --> 48:46.960
I was going to say like if Tom Wheeler finds out that our show is also distributed through

48:47.920 --> 48:50.800
the internet, he might have to turn around on net neutrality.

48:50.800 --> 48:53.680
Like, well, I wanted to be neutral, but look what you've done.

48:53.680 --> 48:55.120
Look at how reckless you've been.

48:55.120 --> 48:58.480
Brothers, I work at a very large company with a very lax dress code.

48:58.480 --> 49:00.640
Somebody in my building takes things a bit too far.

49:00.640 --> 49:03.360
He never wears shoes or socks.

49:03.360 --> 49:08.960
At times I see him in our cafeteria with naked feet and even worse, there have been times

49:08.960 --> 49:14.800
when I've seen him at the urinal without any barrier between his feet and everything else.

49:14.800 --> 49:16.000
Tapping out, tapping out.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.600
You guys handle this one alone.

49:17.600 --> 49:19.600
I am, I need to take a walk.

49:20.320 --> 49:25.440
How can I let this very casual acquaintance know that this is not okay, even if it does

49:26.400 --> 49:27.760
still fit in our dress code?

49:28.480 --> 49:30.880
That's from Mortified in Madison.

49:30.880 --> 49:35.520
You're going to need to accidentally step on his feet a couple of times.

49:35.520 --> 49:39.200
Or just don't worry about it because I think the staph infection will probably get him.

49:39.200 --> 49:41.840
I think he's not super long for this world.

49:42.640 --> 49:43.920
This was my RA.

49:43.920 --> 49:45.440
Athlete's foot again?

49:45.440 --> 49:46.560
This is the third time this week.

49:46.560 --> 49:49.040
Weird, I've got staph on one foot and MRSA on the other.

49:49.040 --> 49:50.400
How does this keep happening?

49:50.400 --> 49:52.400
My foot has smallpox?

49:52.400 --> 49:53.520
This doesn't seem to make sense.

49:53.520 --> 49:55.520
I have like a foot buffet of gross diseases.

49:56.720 --> 49:58.960
Somebody must have nerdgasm all over this place.

49:58.960 --> 50:01.360
This was my RA.

50:01.360 --> 50:02.800
A lot of challenging ideas.

50:02.800 --> 50:09.120
My freshman year, he was known for always being barefoot, like walking around campus,

50:09.120 --> 50:10.160
being outdoors.

50:10.800 --> 50:16.160
And like I asked him about it eventually and he was like, you know, at first my feet were

50:16.160 --> 50:20.000
real tender, but you know, after a while they really like toughen and leather up and now

50:20.000 --> 50:21.200
it doesn't even bother me anymore.

50:21.200 --> 50:24.720
That's what you want because that's what you gotta have.

50:24.720 --> 50:27.200
Basically his feet became shoes.

50:27.200 --> 50:30.800
I only know one other person that's done this and it's Bobby McFerrin.

50:30.800 --> 50:34.000
I saw an interview with Bobby McFerrin and he never wears shoes.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.720
He says he wants to have rough feet like a dancer's feet.

50:36.720 --> 50:38.320
So Bobby McFerrin never wears shoes.

50:38.320 --> 50:39.440
He's no tender foot.

50:39.440 --> 50:41.440
I don't care how rough your goddamn feet are.

50:41.440 --> 50:44.640
I don't care if you grow a pair of fucking chucks around them like they're goddamn foot

50:44.640 --> 50:45.200
chitin.

50:45.200 --> 50:46.800
You put fucking shoes on.

50:46.800 --> 50:50.720
You put on Japanese courtesy sandals before you go to use the urinal.

50:50.720 --> 50:52.640
What are you fucking talking about?

50:52.640 --> 50:56.000
In the Japanese style put some goddamn slippers on.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.120
Slime foot?

50:57.120 --> 50:59.360
Hey, welcome to the company, slime foot.

50:59.360 --> 51:00.800
It's super duper casual Friday.

51:00.800 --> 51:04.720
I see you're not wearing pants, but you will put on goddamn courtesy sandals or else I'll

51:04.720 --> 51:05.760
fucking fire you.

51:06.400 --> 51:09.760
Guys, my favorite contemporary Christian band is Slime Foot.

51:09.760 --> 51:10.960
You beat me to it.

51:10.960 --> 51:12.000
Oh my god.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.760
This is the grossest and worst thing I've ever heard in my life.

51:16.560 --> 51:21.600
I don't care if you walk around and you step on goddamn hedgehog quills all day and you

51:21.600 --> 51:23.040
still don't get the net.

51:23.040 --> 51:26.800
You put on fucking Japanese courtesy sandals before you step in front of the urinal.

51:26.800 --> 51:28.320
What if you actually piss on your foot?

51:28.320 --> 51:33.120
What kind of fucking large company doesn't care that one of its employees isn't wearing

51:33.120 --> 51:33.620
shoes?

51:34.240 --> 51:35.840
Like how fucking chill?

51:36.880 --> 51:38.960
Unless your large company-

51:38.960 --> 51:41.280
The answer to your question, Travis, is Radio Shack.

51:41.280 --> 51:43.200
Like they're just buying their time, right?

51:44.400 --> 51:46.720
It's basically senior year of college in there.

51:47.280 --> 51:52.320
Yeah, everyone in Radio Shack gives us some weird dates of senior items.

51:52.320 --> 51:53.120
I don't care.

51:53.120 --> 51:55.680
They're just waiting to graduate through unemployment.

51:55.680 --> 51:56.480
If there are-

51:57.600 --> 52:00.000
By the way, if you listen to this show and you work at Radio Shack, I'm sure it's gonna

52:00.000 --> 52:00.560
be working.

52:00.560 --> 52:04.160
Or RBs or any place of business that we make fun of constantly.

52:05.040 --> 52:15.280
I don't care if there are dozens of nozzles hooked up to like propane tanks that just

52:15.280 --> 52:20.160
sort of line the bathroom and only one person's allowed inside at a time and then when that

52:20.160 --> 52:24.480
person walks out, the room is just sort of blasted.

52:24.480 --> 52:30.800
Just sort of flame blasted to kill every living thing inside of it and dry up every ounce

52:30.800 --> 52:32.640
of spume off the floor.

52:33.520 --> 52:36.080
You put Japanese courtesy sandals on before you walk in.

52:36.080 --> 52:42.480
I don't care if a fleet of fucking microbots scour it or those scrubbing bubbles.

52:42.480 --> 52:47.440
If those things were actually real and did their thing to completely fucking cauterize

52:47.440 --> 52:47.680
this bathroom.

52:47.680 --> 52:48.720
You're not wearing any shoes.

52:48.720 --> 52:49.920
That's disgusting.

52:49.920 --> 52:53.280
Yeah, let's get on there or not because even we have limits.

52:53.280 --> 52:55.600
Like, that's the fucking worst mental-

52:55.600 --> 52:56.320
I'm thinking-

52:56.320 --> 53:00.800
This has ruined my day because now I'm imagining the sensation of getting slimy feet.

53:00.800 --> 53:02.800
Fucking dare you to move slime foot.

53:02.800 --> 53:03.440
And I can't-

53:04.000 --> 53:05.520
I literally won't be able to sleep tonight.

53:05.520 --> 53:05.920
So thank you for this very much.

53:05.920 --> 53:07.600
How chunky is this dude?

53:07.600 --> 53:12.720
Like, how crunchy is he that he's like, nah, man, it's God's feet.

53:12.720 --> 53:14.240
Dog, listen, dog.

53:14.240 --> 53:15.600
That's God's piss on the floor.

53:15.600 --> 53:17.680
Listen, we all piss.

53:17.680 --> 53:20.800
I know we all piss and we don't talk about it.

53:20.800 --> 53:24.480
It's totally natural to get other people's pee pee on the bottom of my feet.

53:24.480 --> 53:26.400
The office is a flat circle.

53:26.400 --> 53:27.200
Just walk around.

53:27.200 --> 53:28.080
Just get it, walk around.

53:28.080 --> 53:29.440
Doesn't even matter, man.

53:29.440 --> 53:30.400
Slippery when wet.

53:30.400 --> 53:31.360
You know what I mean, dog?

53:31.360 --> 53:32.000
Know what I'm saying?

53:32.000 --> 53:32.960
Why are your feet pretty?

53:32.960 --> 53:34.480
It's from the bathroom floor.

53:35.120 --> 53:35.440
Cool.

53:35.440 --> 53:37.120
I stepped in all the piss.

53:37.120 --> 53:39.040
This is the worst day of my life.

53:39.040 --> 53:40.480
This is the worst day of my life.

53:40.480 --> 53:42.000
It all mingles together.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.440
Everyone's piss is equal, brother.

53:44.400 --> 53:45.760
You're fired from RadioShack.

53:45.760 --> 53:46.560
Get out.

53:46.560 --> 53:49.360
You know, there have been moments where someone has walked in the bathroom and seen him with

53:49.360 --> 53:50.240
his feet in the sink.

53:50.240 --> 53:51.120
Ah, sorry, bud.

53:51.120 --> 53:51.680
Sorry, bud.

53:51.680 --> 53:52.240
Some gum.

53:53.360 --> 54:00.560
Do you think that what happened was this crunchy dude didn't want to go in the bathroom barefoot,

54:00.560 --> 54:04.640
but he committed to this barefoot lifestyle and he was like, I can't back out now.

54:04.640 --> 54:07.040
They'll all know that I don't really believe in this.

54:07.040 --> 54:12.480
And he had to make that he didn't use the bathroom at work for the first three months.

54:12.480 --> 54:14.960
And then was like, no, I just got to get over it.

54:14.960 --> 54:19.120
Or else the other horrifying reality is that this gentleman like wakes up every day going,

54:19.120 --> 54:20.160
doesn't matter.

54:20.160 --> 54:21.120
I don't care.

54:21.600 --> 54:23.840
Doesn't bother me at all what I step on.

54:23.840 --> 54:25.040
Think about this.

54:25.680 --> 54:29.520
Every office has that one guy that throws half finished sandwiches on the floor.

54:29.520 --> 54:34.960
So think about that guy and the shoeless guy in the same office.

54:34.960 --> 54:38.240
They I bet those two cats do not get along very well.

54:38.240 --> 54:41.920
Now they've taped off the office and they're like, you can be barefoot on that side.

54:41.920 --> 54:43.760
I can drop food on this side.

54:43.760 --> 54:45.840
Don't cross the line.

54:45.840 --> 54:46.560
I'm tired.

54:46.560 --> 54:48.880
I'm tired of getting pastrami toes, bro.

54:50.080 --> 54:51.680
You got your feet in my sandwich.

54:51.680 --> 54:53.600
You got your sandwich in my feet.

54:53.600 --> 54:54.320
Wait a minute.

54:54.320 --> 54:54.960
Wait a minute.

54:54.960 --> 54:55.520
This sucks.

54:55.520 --> 54:56.320
And we both suck.

54:57.120 --> 54:58.640
My birthday's in like a month.

54:59.280 --> 55:03.600
I want you to get me a fucking eternal sunshine in the spotless mind treatment to erase this

55:03.600 --> 55:04.240
episode from my mind.

55:04.240 --> 55:04.960
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

55:06.160 --> 55:06.960
Yeah, hit me.

55:06.960 --> 55:09.120
This Yahoo was sent in by Ira Ray.

55:10.080 --> 55:11.600
Are you Ira Ray?

55:11.600 --> 55:12.800
Who wants to know?

55:12.800 --> 55:13.360
Thank you Ira Ray.

55:13.360 --> 55:14.560
It's by Yahoo Answers User.

55:16.320 --> 55:19.200
Wow, Yahoo, your site fucking sucks now.

55:19.200 --> 55:21.520
It's been a while since I've railed on Yahoo.

55:21.520 --> 55:25.760
But like when your goddamn usernames won't even show up, get it fucking together.

55:25.760 --> 55:26.320
Let me refresh.

55:26.320 --> 55:27.200
See if that fixes it.

55:28.560 --> 55:30.480
No, you just made me waste bandwidth.

55:30.480 --> 55:31.600
God damn it, Yahoo.

55:32.320 --> 55:33.440
Thank you Ira Ray.

55:33.440 --> 55:34.480
And it's by Mr. User.

55:34.480 --> 55:39.520
And they ask, how can I glamp my tent like glamping but do it yourself?

55:40.080 --> 55:42.960
I am going camping and I always see this glamorous camping.

55:42.960 --> 55:45.440
But I want to glamp up my tent, but not make it cheesy.

55:45.440 --> 55:46.080
How can I?

55:46.640 --> 55:47.760
Well, we've all been there.

55:48.880 --> 55:50.240
Oh man, I stepped in glamp.

55:51.360 --> 55:53.600
Gotta start wearing Japanese courtesy sandals.

55:53.600 --> 55:56.800
Could you point me to your glamp aisle, please?

55:56.800 --> 55:58.640
I'm just really looking to glamp up my tent.

55:58.640 --> 55:59.360
Nope, nope, nope.

55:59.360 --> 56:01.360
They're asking for a DIY glamping solution.

56:02.560 --> 56:03.680
Wait a minute, hold on.

56:03.680 --> 56:04.640
Time out, time out, time out.

56:05.360 --> 56:09.440
Earlier in this episode, we had someone who said that they helped someone move

56:09.440 --> 56:14.000
an absolute mountain of things and all they got in exchange was a single

56:14.000 --> 56:15.200
pizza split between them.

56:15.200 --> 56:15.680
Right.

56:15.680 --> 56:17.040
Cold pizza, single pizza slice.

56:17.040 --> 56:18.240
A single split, yeah.

56:18.240 --> 56:23.760
And just now we had someone who is looking to go DIY glamping, presumably

56:23.760 --> 56:26.960
by putting a bunch of like electronics and fancy things in their tent.

56:27.600 --> 56:32.880
Are people just sending us Parks and Rec episode synopsis as question?

56:32.880 --> 56:34.800
Like, is that where we're at right now?

56:34.800 --> 56:38.160
Because this is the second question we've had in this episode that has mirrored

56:38.160 --> 56:39.680
a plot line from Parks and Rec.

56:39.680 --> 56:42.320
And you remember that episode where Ron didn't wear shoes and everyone peed

56:42.320 --> 56:43.360
all over his feet?

56:43.360 --> 56:43.920
Yeah.

56:43.920 --> 56:45.520
Remember that hit episode?

56:45.520 --> 56:47.200
This question was asked six years ago.

56:47.200 --> 56:48.400
So I think it precedes-

56:48.400 --> 56:49.760
This is a rich ARG.

56:49.760 --> 56:50.260
Yeah.

56:52.400 --> 56:56.240
I can't believe that glamping, that very concept existed in 2009.

56:56.960 --> 56:57.520
But it probably-

56:57.520 --> 56:59.920
I have a hard time believing 2009 existed.

56:59.920 --> 57:00.420
Yeah.

57:01.440 --> 57:02.080
Glamping.

57:02.080 --> 57:02.560
Glamping.

57:02.560 --> 57:03.760
Do you know about glamping, Justin?

57:04.480 --> 57:07.280
Yeah, it's basically living in West Virginia, right?

57:07.280 --> 57:10.720
Yeah, basically everywhere you are in West Virginia, you are glamping or camping.

57:10.720 --> 57:14.160
This, once again, this strikes me very similar to the nerdgasm question,

57:14.160 --> 57:16.800
because it seems to me to be a failure of language.

57:17.440 --> 57:22.480
We're like, if you understand that glamping is glamorous camping,

57:22.480 --> 57:24.960
I don't understand where the confusion is.

57:24.960 --> 57:28.000
Like, there's not a specific thing you do.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.800
It's not like, oh, if you don't have blank, you're not glamping.

57:30.800 --> 57:32.000
It's like, okay, great.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.200
Get an air mattress.

57:33.200 --> 57:36.320
Like, take shit with you.

57:36.320 --> 57:40.160
Like, there isn't a manual to follow to glamp.

57:40.160 --> 57:41.840
No, but there is a breaking point.

57:41.840 --> 57:42.960
There's a tipping point.

57:42.960 --> 57:46.480
There's a Malcolm Gladwell tipping point where you're just housing.

57:46.480 --> 57:47.760
Like, you bring too much shit with you.

57:47.760 --> 57:48.880
You blay down some plumbing.

57:48.880 --> 57:50.080
You put down a toilet.

57:50.080 --> 57:51.280
You bring in your TV.

57:51.280 --> 57:53.360
You just moved is what you did, and you built a new house.

57:53.360 --> 57:54.560
And you're on the grid.

57:54.560 --> 57:55.600
You're not even off the grid anymore.

57:55.600 --> 57:57.040
You're on the grid, and you're getting-

57:57.040 --> 57:57.840
You are the grid.

57:57.840 --> 57:59.600
You're the grid, and you're getting mail there.

57:59.600 --> 58:01.680
You're getting all of your Amazon Prime delivered to you there.

58:01.680 --> 58:06.320
If you have to call the grid to get set up, then you've probably over glamped.

58:06.320 --> 58:09.200
But what if you don't do enough, and now you're just camping?

58:10.960 --> 58:12.880
And you're like, well, I brought Tiffany's lamp.

58:12.880 --> 58:14.320
And you're like, yeah, but that's all you brought.

58:14.320 --> 58:15.680
You got nothing to plug it into.

58:15.680 --> 58:17.680
This is just camping, but delicately.

58:18.240 --> 58:21.120
Justin, can I ask when the last time you went camping was?

58:21.120 --> 58:27.440
That time that Trav invited us out there, out to camp, and told us he bought a bunch of beer.

58:27.440 --> 58:30.160
And then the ranger caught him and made him dump out his beer in front of him.

58:30.160 --> 58:32.080
Yeah, that was not a good trip.

58:32.080 --> 58:33.040
That was a rough one.

58:33.040 --> 58:34.400
We haven't been camping since then.

58:35.040 --> 58:36.880
Burned a lot of bridges that day.

58:36.880 --> 58:39.600
Yeah, with the park service, with nature, the whole bit.

58:40.400 --> 58:40.960
You know what?

58:40.960 --> 58:42.640
I never really thought about it.

58:42.640 --> 58:49.200
It is kind of a fucked up priority if the guy charged with preserving this park is like,

58:49.200 --> 58:51.360
I can't have anybody getting drunk in here.

58:51.360 --> 58:58.720
But if you want to go ahead and dump two gallons of Michelob here into the unspoiled wilderness,

58:58.720 --> 59:01.120
then that would probably be fine, man.

59:01.120 --> 59:03.360
If you're going to get drunk, Mother Earth is going to get drunk.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.160
I bet some birds probably got real fucked up that day.

59:10.800 --> 59:16.400
Last time I went, well, the thing that happened is the thing that happens every time I go camping,

59:16.400 --> 59:20.720
which is somehow I just get diarrhea out there and it just sort of happens every time I go out

59:20.720 --> 59:20.880
there.

59:20.880 --> 59:25.600
So my ideal glamping solution does not involve bedazzling my flaps.

59:25.600 --> 59:31.200
It does involve just finding out, just sort of figuring out what's going on in my tract

59:31.200 --> 59:33.280
when I get all natural and stuff.

59:34.240 --> 59:34.720
I don't know why.

59:34.720 --> 59:40.800
I don't know how I can counteract that with like modernity, which is the secret of glamping.

59:40.800 --> 59:42.560
But I do wish that I could, I don't know.

59:42.560 --> 59:44.000
Maybe I just have a doctor on him.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.160
Maybe that's my glamp procedure.

59:48.560 --> 59:53.280
Is it still camping if you go and stay in like a pre-built cabin-y thing?

59:53.280 --> 59:53.760
No.

59:53.760 --> 59:57.280
No, now it's just hoteling, right?

59:57.280 --> 01:00:02.800
If the structure, okay, if the structure existed before you got there, you are not camping

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.480
or glamping, I would say.

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:08.720
I think if you set up your structure, you can fairly call it glamping no matter what

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:09.920
you do after that point.

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:14.960
Like if you set up a tent outside your house, you're still camping.

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:18.800
What if you just knocked down a wall of your house and put up some flaps?

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:19.040
Yeah.

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:21.360
Whoa, that's an idea.

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:27.200
What if you built like a tent and then you just put up a bunch of like trash bags to

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:29.440
make a tunnel connecting the tent to your house?

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:30.480
That would be-

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:32.240
You would never be in the tent.

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.560
You would just have the option there available to you.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.440
The tent is there.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:35.840
Right.

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.280
It's tent adjacent.

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.400
I could be sleeping out there.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.080
It's very, there's a lot of pill bugs.

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:40.800
I don't like that.

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:43.680
No, or any bugs, really, if you think about it.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.120
Not a big fan of bugs.

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:48.160
But every time Griffin sleeps in the tent, he does get diarrhea.

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:51.120
It's, it's, it's, guys, am I allergic?

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:55.120
Am I allergic to like vinyl housing?

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.400
Like what, what happened?

01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:01.920
Is it just the knowledge that there is no bathroom close by that just sours me?

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:02.320
What goes-

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:05.120
If Griffin looks through mesh, he has to shit.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.640
That might, maybe that might be it.

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:13.440
The sound of crickets, if too loud, the frequency resonates with my tract in a way that I do

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.440
not understand, but I do not appreciate.

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.800
I'll tell you what's going to help me glamp.

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:18.320
Yep.

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:23.120
Having a full-time doctor just come with me and in order to have someone like that in

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:24.720
my retinue, I'm going to need a lot of money.

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:27.520
How are you going to get a lot of money at this hour?

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:32.560
Well, I was thinking I get either just sort of go door to door asking people to give me

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:38.560
money because, and I will explain to them all about my woods diarrhea, or I can channel-

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:39.600
Have you heard the good news?

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:47.360
Or I can channel our listenership to see if they'll chip in, you know, a few bucks a month.

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.680
And help us out, help support the podcast.

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:54.000
I promise I won't spend it on natural woods doctors.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:02:00.400
We will spend it on expanding the show and doing all kinds of cool stuff with the donations

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:01.920
and supporting the Maximum Fund Network.

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:06.560
If you go to MaximumFund.org slash donate, it's very, very easy.

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.600
In just a couple minutes, you'll be able to get set up and then you don't have to think

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:10.400
about it again.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:16.240
It just automatically pops out of your, whatever card you set up to give us donations.

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:19.840
And you can really help us out to grow and try and do cool new stuff.

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:23.120
We got some, we got some cool stuff we want to do with the show and we need your support

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.120
if we're going to follow through with it.

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:32.400
So if you are able to kick in $5 a month, you will get a shit gaggle of exclusive bonus

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:37.040
content that is only going to go out to donors for this year and every year prior for every

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:37.600
show on the network.

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:38.160
It's crazy.

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:41.440
There's dozens and dozens of episodes of podcasts for you to listen to.

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:45.200
If you chip in $10 a month, you will get a drive exclusive tote bag.

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:46.560
You can put anything in that tote bag.

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:51.040
We won't, there's no camera installed in the tote bag to tell you what you can and can't

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:55.680
put in it because you're an adult now and you have the freedom to decide what to put

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.360
in your own goddamn tote bags.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.200
There's no tote bag law yet.

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.480
No, not yet.

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:04.000
No gods or kings, only tote bags.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:09.200
Listen, this is our last pledge break of this year.

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:17.040
Last pledge break of this Max Fun Drive and this is your last chance to say, hey, these

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.080
shows are worthwhile.

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:19.440
These shows are worth doing.

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.400
These shows are worth making.

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:25.920
The people who make these shows, the Max Fun Drive, jokes aside, not getting rich doing

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:29.120
it, mainly just kind of do it because it's fun.

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:35.200
We would be recording this show with much worse equipment and much cheaper hosting and

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:38.720
probably more infrequently even without you folks.

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:45.920
But it is, in the sort of society that we form for ourselves, the way you vote anymore

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:47.200
is with your money.

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:51.760
And if you like the stuff that we're doing here on Max Fun, this is the way you say,

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:53.280
hey, I want more of this stuff.

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:57.840
Like we've talked about before, the reason we did another show, the reason we started

01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:02.720
the Adventure Zone was because a lot of people said, hey, I want this.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:03.920
I want you guys to do that.

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:07.920
And people who listen to that show have been coming in in droves, I think, to donate to

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:09.280
the Max Fun Drive.

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:13.680
And if you like what we're doing here and you want it to keep going and you want more

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:17.280
of it, this is the way you make that happen.

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:21.200
And I also want to say that every year since we've joined, my brother, my brother, and

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:25.120
me listeners have really brought it to the Max Fun Drive.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.120
And it always makes me feel really honored.

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:29.520
And I just really appreciate it.

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:30.480
I just want to say thank you.

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.680
So go to maxfunfund.org slash donate.

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:34.880
Pick a level that works for you.

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:39.680
$20 a month, you get the in-flight power pack with mobile device charger, collapsible water

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.600
bottle, antibacterial wipes, and pilot wings.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:44.000
$35 a month, you get the rocket engraved shot glasses.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.120
$100 a month, you get to be in the Inner Circle, which is our culture club where we

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:50.400
will send you cool cultural stuff that we like.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:53.920
$200 a month, you get the free registration for Max Fun Con 2016.

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:56.960
But you don't have to do $200 a month, obviously.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:57.760
That's a big ask.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:00.320
You just do what feels comfortable for you.

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:05.200
$5 a month is like what, like one Starbucks cup of coffee.

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:12.800
If you're comfortable with it and that price makes sense to you for what you get out of

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:14.400
our shows, just think about it.

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:16.240
Maxfunfund.org slash donate.

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:22.560
And if you're already a donor and maybe you started at $5 a month in the past and you're

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:27.280
like, you know what, I feel like I could give a little bit more, upgrading donors count

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:28.880
towards our numbers as well.

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:30.800
And we appreciate any amount you can give.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:34.560
And also, we understand that sometimes you can't afford to give it all.

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:37.920
And I think everyone's been there at some point in their lives.

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:39.040
And that's totally cool.

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:43.120
What you can do is make sure you tweet about the drive, talk to your friends, tell the

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:47.440
people you know that listen to our shows and other shows on Max Fun Network and say, hey,

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.280
have you given to Max Fun Drive yet?

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:54.480
And getting the word out, talking about it on Facebook and Twitter, it's the best thing

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:59.200
you can do to help get people on board with it and say like, hey, check out these shows,

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:01.360
listen to this thing and then help support them.

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:06.240
We appreciate everything you guys do to get the Max Fun Drive as successful as it is.

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:07.040
Yeah.

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.320
Thank you all so, so much.

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.320
And then tell us about it so we can thank you.

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:11.360
Yeah, absolutely.

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:12.160
Question.

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:15.600
When is the right time to throw out a pair of underwear?

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:19.840
Should you be waiting until it's undeniably unrecoverable and ripped and stained?

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:23.440
What if they're mostly serviceable with only a small tear or small mark?

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:24.960
Oh, God.

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:27.280
Or just a bit fake magic.

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:29.040
Challenging episode.

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:33.680
I don't want to be wasteful, but I also don't want to be economical to the point of being

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:34.560
disgusting.

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.480
That's from Pantsless and Perry.

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:40.080
That's from Matthew Perry.

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.800
He's a dirty boy with dirty undergarments.

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:48.160
When should you put your underwear onto the ice floe and send it out to death?

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:50.320
Shoot it with a flaming arrow as it.

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:51.360
Oh, gosh.

01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:56.480
I think rule of thumb is if you would be embarrassed for somebody else to see your underwear, you

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:57.440
should throw it right away.

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:05.760
But don't we all have one or two pairs at the bottom of the rotation that's just like,

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.600
ah, I didn't have time.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.960
That's one that has an ink stain from where the pen broke in my pocket.

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:14.720
Like, ah, it's three weeks since last time I did laundry.

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:16.400
I'm going to wear old ink staining.

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:19.680
For Christmas one year, daddy got me.

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:25.360
But this story is troubling now that I think about it, that my daddy's keeping me in underwears.

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:32.960
But daddy got me a pair of Xbox branded underwear that has the Xbox logo all over it.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:36.480
And on the front it says game, and on the back it says on.

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:40.560
And that pair of underwear, first of all, I should have shot with a flaming arrow while

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:43.440
dad had it in his hands, handed it to me for Christmas.

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:47.440
It would have been very dangerous because my dad is allergic to flaming arrows.

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:51.360
But I should have just blown it sort of straight out of his hands right there and then.

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.240
But I did not.

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:58.320
Instead, it has served as like my blue line on the toothbrush head to let me know that

01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.920
it's time to do laundry.

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:04.880
Because if I get down to wearing my Xbox boxers, I should have done laundry two or three days

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:05.380
ago.

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:08.160
I've allowed myself to get too late.

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:08.880
It's a punishment.

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:13.200
I've allowed myself to get to a point where I have no clothes left because all of them

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:16.240
have my natural stink sort of boiled into it.

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:17.760
Stink sort of boiled into them.

01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:24.720
And now I have to have the shame and embarrassment of when I bend over to pick up, you know,

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:28.320
a wee nunchuck while my friends are over.

01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:32.160
And then they see game on my boxers.

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:33.920
And they say, what is that all about?

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:36.400
And I have to explain, these are my daddy Xbox boxers.

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:44.560
Can I just say that if in speaking about your underpants, the word stained enters into it,

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:48.160
they should have been gone before you emailed us.

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.160
Here's my- here's a yardstick.

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.440
Here's a good yardstick.

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:58.240
If you saw those underwear lying on the ground outside, would you throw them in the trash?

01:08:58.240 --> 01:08:59.280
If so, it's probably priceless.

01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:00.240
Well, hold on, Justin.

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:00.720
If you saw-

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:01.920
Hold on, what's the other-

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:05.040
No, let him finish his terrible, terrible, terrible example.

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:09.920
If you saw these underwear outside and you're like, I can write Dusty's Bad Boys off.

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.360
Oh, Jesus.

01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:14.800
Get a few miles out of them, then I think it's probably okay.

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:19.280
I will say this, if I see some me undies laying on the ground outside,

01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:20.640
I do not care the quality of them.

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:22.480
I will resuscitate them back to life.

01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:26.960
It will not require much work because they are stain proof, tear proof, moisture proof.

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:30.960
When the apocalypse happens, I'm going to build a bunker out of me undies

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:32.720
and I will be the only living man after that.

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:33.840
That's how you go glamping.

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:34.880
You're wearing me undies.

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:35.680
Yeah, for sure.

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:38.240
Welcome to the me undies family time, fun time hour.

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.240
It's so- it's wow, it's not moist in here at all.

01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:40.960
Yeah, I know.

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:42.640
I know exactly what I was doing when I started this.

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:43.200
You're welcome.

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:48.400
When is the- God, I just- I've got a pretty hair trigger for this stuff now.

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:50.320
One of these days I'll throw away my Xbox boxers.

01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:54.080
Maybe that'll be our 4,000 donor bonus is I will just sort of-

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:58.320
How about if we reach 4,000 and you make a video of you shooting them with a flaming arrow?

01:09:58.320 --> 01:09:58.480
Yeah.

01:09:58.480 --> 01:09:59.280
Can you guarantee that?

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:02.400
Or a calendar with the three of us all wearing them at the same time?

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:03.440
What?

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:04.800
How do they do this?

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:05.200
Let's just-

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:05.840
This photoshop.

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:07.280
Let's just do the flaming arrow thing.

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:14.800
Okay, I think that once you start to develop holes, that is definitely out.

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:17.280
Then they're definitely gone, especially around the waistband.

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:21.680
I think that that- you start to get like the waistband pull away, then they've got to go.

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:23.760
And I find that it's like a chain reaction, right?

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:28.320
Because the first- like a couple years ago when I- and it really helped dating Teresa

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:30.240
and her going, oh, you need to throw those away.

01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:32.320
Like your balls are hanging out.

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.840
Get rid of those boxes.

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:38.000
Where once I started doing that and I was like, oh, I should just keep doing this.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.840
I should just throw away the bat.

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:42.320
And then I started like going through my socks and being like, okay,

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:45.040
these socks are like ready to go and throw them away.

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:47.600
And it's this wonderfully adult.

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:50.960
So then you re-gift them and you give them to your cousin and say,

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:53.600
now you can have these gross underpants and socks.

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:54.640
Now these are yours.

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:55.760
I have to go.

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.600
I have a lot of grinder business to get to.

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:01.200
Time is a flat circle.

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:02.800
Travis, you- sorry.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:05.840
I got to circle back to something, speaking of flat circles.

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:08.000
You did mention that your balls are hanging on your boxers.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.320
I am curious how you get holes in the front of your boxers.

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.840
Is your dick a werewolf?

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:12.160
No, no.

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.800
This was in the, in the taint of the boxers.

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:15.280
We're done here.

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:17.520
Oh, another great episode of my-

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.960
That'll be $30, please.

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.640
Time to wipe off the grease paint.

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:24.720
One last time, maximumfund.org first I should donate.

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.880
Please, please, please help us out.

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.040
We joke about being rich, but that was just a bit for the show.

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:34.080
And you can keep those bids coming if you go donate

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:36.080
at maximumfund.org first slash donate.

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:37.040
Chip in whenever you can.

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:40.800
You know, we don't charge for the stuff on the network

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:43.920
because we think people who want it to keep coming will,

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:46.080
will pay money to make sure that that happens.

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.960
So please take a moment right now.

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:49.520
Don't wait.

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.240
Don't hesitate.

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:51.600
Don't regulate.

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.240
Just go to maximumfund.org first slash donate.

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:57.120
Tickets are still on sale for our Chicago show

01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:59.040
for our Midwest mini tour.

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:02.160
If you want to go to that, just go to bit.ly

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:04.720
four slash MBMBAM Chicago.

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:06.960
And you will find a ticket links there.

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.120
If you are going to one of the shows,

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:11.040
either in Minneapolis, Milwaukee, or Chicago,

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:14.160
make sure you send us an email with the name of the city

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:16.400
that you're going to the show in, in the subject line

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:18.960
and let us know so we can answer your question

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:21.840
in a live studio environment.

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.960
Don't forget to tweet using the maxfund drive hashtag.

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:28.480
So you can be entered to win that free tick to max fun con.

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:29.840
And if you can fit it in,

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:33.040
throwing in the maximumfund.org slash donate link

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:37.200
would also be great or the MBMBAM hashtag,

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:38.560
because like, it'd be great to know

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:40.400
that it was one of our people that won that thing.

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:44.080
If you have any ideas for a tattoo,

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:47.680
I can get to celebrate our 2,500 donors.

01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:49.440
Well, you know, I've been thinking about,

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:50.400
I am putting it off.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:51.280
I've been putting it off.

01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:52.640
I've been putting, what better time?

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:56.080
So if you have an idea for one, tweet at me and let me know.

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.160
And then when the drive is over,

01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:00.080
I will let everyone know what I've gone with.

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:02.480
And then I'll post all kinds of pictures when I get it.

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:04.480
Do they get to decide on the part of your body it goes on to?

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:06.480
Dick.

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.800
Well, I don't think so.

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:11.920
Only because too many people I think would jokingly say face

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.120
and I'm not going to do that.

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:13.680
Yeah.

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:14.720
Would it be better?

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:17.920
Could you, could you get one that's on your penis

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:19.200
that said welcome aboard?

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:22.400
So instead of it's a MBMBAM references,

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.400
the down periscope reference, would that be better?

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.240
Well, I think that most people are clamoring

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:28.160
for more down periscope references.

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:30.640
So maybe what I, the two I'm thinking about right now

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:32.800
is middle list in very flowing script.

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:37.520
And then either that or a cartoon ghost horse.

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:39.920
Please just wow Travis with a design

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:41.280
and maybe he'll get that.

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:41.680
I don't know.

01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:42.880
Sounds good to me.

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:44.880
Also, while the drive is going,

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:47.280
go listen to the other maximum fun shows.

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:48.960
We do other shows.

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:51.040
Justin does a medical history show called Sawbones

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:52.080
with his wife, Sydney.

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:54.560
Travis does a show called Bunker Buddies with his buddy, Andy.

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:57.200
And the three of us do the adventure zone with our dad,

01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:59.360
which is a Dungeons and Dragons podcast that-

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:02.080
We just had a Bunker Buddies, Sawbones crossover episode

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.000
where Sydney came on to talk to us

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.840
about plagues and global plagues.

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:06.480
Oh, that's awesome.

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:08.320
It's very, very fun and very informative.

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:09.200
I highly recommend it.

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:09.840
So check it out.

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:11.280
But go listen to the other shows of the network too.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:13.280
Jordan and Jesse go stop podcasting yourself,

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:14.000
throwing shade.

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.640
Rendered is a really good one.

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:18.400
I've been listening to that one a lot.

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:21.600
You are, I promise you will really dig Rendered.

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:22.080
So check that out.

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:23.040
Oh no, Ross and Carrie.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:23.600
Oh no, Ross and Carrie.

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:24.800
That we talked about early in the show.

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:25.520
Flophouse.

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:26.560
Flophouse, Pop Rocket.

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:28.080
There's infinity shows

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.400
and they're putting out their best stuff during the drive.

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:31.280
So go listen to it.

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:33.200
Did you just thank John Roderick?

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:34.000
No, will you do it?

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:36.400
Thanks, John Roderick and the long winners

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.360
for the use of our theme song.

01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:39.440
It's a departure off the album, put the days to bed.

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:43.200
Thanks again to Lin-Manuel Miranda for the bonus song,

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:45.040
the fugue for brother horns.

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:50.000
And if you're in New York in like the summer,

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.120
go see Hamilton.

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.560
It's amazing and it's great.

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:55.680
It's from this summer through the end of time

01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:58.400
because that show is going to be the biggest goddamn thing ever.

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.800
It's absolutely astonishing and very,

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.000
like the best thing I've ever seen.

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:05.040
So yeah, you're gonna dig that.

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.560
Griffin, do you have a final Yahoo?

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:12.320
Yeah, this final Yahoo was sent in by Zoe Kinski.

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:12.960
Thank you, Zoe.

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:15.840
It's by Yahoo Answers user Timelordess.

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:17.600
Finally, the goddamn website loaded.

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:24.720
And who asks, not actually a question, James Spader?

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:31.520
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:36.480
He's Travis McElroy.

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:37.600
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.040
This has been my brother and me.

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:48.640
Kiss your dads, wear on the lips.

01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:59.520
Maximumfun.org.

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:00.560
Comedy and culture.

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:01.680
Artist owned.

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:02.640
Listener supported.

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:08.000
We're Dave and Graham and we host Stop Piecasting Yourself.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.200
We started this podcast back in 2008.

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:13.760
Before podcasts had to have any kind of concept,

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:15.680
so we don't really know how to describe it.

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:17.760
It's kind of like going to the barber shop

01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:22.400
if your barber knew all about the first season of the show Elf.

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:24.080
It's like a 90 minute massage

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:27.600
where the masseuse is two people talking to each other with a third person.

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:30.240
It's like the Monsters of Metal tour,

01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:33.040
only quieter, no music, and just talking.

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:34.720
It's like a makeout session,

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:37.440
but without the lips touching, they just talk a lot.

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:45.280
