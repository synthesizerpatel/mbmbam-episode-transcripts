WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:46.320 --> 00:52.640
Miners. Nope, nope. See, you said you got it. You didn't have it, did you? I do have it because

00:52.640 --> 00:59.760
it's it's it's the two year anniversary. Is it the day of? It is close. You're doing like when

00:59.760 --> 01:06.480
you do Disneyland's birthday where it's like the entire year. This year, all year, we're

01:06.480 --> 01:12.000
celebrating the second year anniversary of the Chilean mining. I don't think you can do that.

01:12.000 --> 01:19.120
I think I feel like our listeners can can chart like when there's no big news stories or big

01:19.120 --> 01:24.720
movies coming out like, ah, here come the here come the miners. I wish I wish it was that simple

01:24.720 --> 01:28.400
because then we would have gotten them out with the release of Captain America and they would

01:28.400 --> 01:35.280
have only been in there for like 45 days rather than 69. Yeah, but yeah, I mean, October 13th,

01:35.280 --> 01:40.080
right? It's just around the seas, just around the court. That was the day. Hey, do you guys have

01:40.080 --> 01:48.720
your Halloween costumes picked out yet? I'm a fifth of Christmas. Christmas just around the

01:48.720 --> 01:57.920
corner now. Yeah. Well, the fifth of August is when they get it got in. Oh, I see. So we're

01:57.920 --> 02:01.680
celebrating. We're celebrating the two year anniversary of them getting trapped. Yeah,

02:01.680 --> 02:08.000
we're celebrating entry day, not Emergence Day. Oh, no, forget that. Right now we're celebrating

02:08.000 --> 02:12.640
the the two year anniversary of when they went in in two weeks. We'll celebrate the two year

02:12.640 --> 02:19.760
anniversary of when America kind of lost interest. Yeah. And then in like in 70 days, we'll celebrate

02:19.760 --> 02:25.280
America getting back into it again in a big, big way. You know, day one, they probably didn't know

02:25.280 --> 02:29.680
that they're that their shit was so, so fucked, right? They probably thought that they were going

02:29.680 --> 02:35.520
on another fun spelunking adventure. Right. But I think around day three, the shine sort of came

02:35.520 --> 02:41.120
off the apple. It's just like camping, isn't it? You know, they're so nice to be back in nature or

02:41.120 --> 02:48.560
in this case, a lightless oxygen. But there's even less threat of bears, right? Well, except

02:48.560 --> 02:57.200
for underground bears. Exactly. Fossil bears, bone bears. Yeah. So so this is our advice to

02:57.200 --> 03:02.880
to the slay miners really savor savor this time. It's your time. You earned it because this is an

03:02.880 --> 03:07.600
advice show. After all, it's an invite to call my brother, my brother and me. And I am the oldest

03:07.600 --> 03:15.280
mining brother, Justin McElroy. I'm the middle. I don't mind things. Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin

03:15.280 --> 03:21.520
McElroy. I'm playing Minecraft right now while we record the show. So if I don't if I'm not paying

03:21.520 --> 03:26.960
attention, it's because of the Minecraft little known fact. Griffin is the canary of my brother,

03:26.960 --> 03:31.280
my brother and me. If he if he dies, then we know that the air has become toxic and we have to stop

03:31.280 --> 03:34.960
doing the podcast. Oh, I think we all know I'm not going to be the brother that dies first.

03:36.160 --> 03:44.480
Which brother is the brother that died? One, one, two, three. Travis, Justin. Yeah. See, I was going

03:44.480 --> 03:49.840
to say Griffin and now we're all split. OK, I know that you have a weak constitution. Yeah. What

03:49.840 --> 03:55.520
if we do a murder murder suicide pact? Yeah. Well, who's the suicide? We're all going to live up to

03:55.520 --> 04:01.520
that. I mean, if you guys need me to kill you, I would kill you. Unfortunately, we're booked on

04:01.520 --> 04:05.360
sponsors for the next couple of months, so we can't off ourselves yet. But maybe. OK, great. Maybe

04:05.360 --> 04:11.360
after that we can kill ourselves. Maybe. Oh, for sweeps. For podcast sweeps. For podcast sweeps.

04:11.920 --> 04:18.240
Hey, have you guys listened to me? Super good. They're going through some radical changes,

04:18.240 --> 04:23.920
both personally and professionally. It's a big departure, literally. Here on my brother,

04:23.920 --> 04:29.920
my brother and me, we take your queries, we turn them alchemy like into wisdom and let's get to it.

04:30.480 --> 04:37.360
Our first question on and off for a year now. I have been sexty texting. That's a gray zone

04:37.360 --> 04:44.160
between sexting and flirty texting a fella. The other day he told me that he has been engaged

04:44.160 --> 04:51.840
for about four months. Am I good? Should I stop or can I continue and leave the moral ambiguity

04:51.840 --> 05:00.880
in his court? That's from Gmail. There there is no middle ground between regular texting and sexting.

05:00.880 --> 05:06.880
There's no there's no four plex thing. There's no there's no next thing. You're just you're either

05:06.880 --> 05:11.760
doing it or you're not doing it. It sounds like you're doing it. I'm also going to throw out here

05:11.760 --> 05:19.120
not to pass judgment. There's not a lot of moral ambiguity here. Yeah, I would say it's pretty

05:19.120 --> 05:24.160
pretty morally black and white here. We're desperate for slivers of light to help you

05:24.160 --> 05:32.480
shimmy out of, but first of all, sweet, sweet life giving water down. I do agree that it's I mean,

05:32.480 --> 05:38.880
it's on him, you know? Well, I mean, no, but I'm saying the previous bad is on him.

05:39.760 --> 05:46.560
Future bad is on both of you. Yeah, yeah. Fool me once, then that one's on that one's on me. Fool

05:46.560 --> 05:54.160
me twice for four months after you've been engaged. That's no good, dog. Yeah, that's not. Oh, man,

05:54.160 --> 06:01.200
this is a tough putt. I can I know you're I understand you're invested in this. It is so much

06:01.200 --> 06:06.720
as you can be invested in a relationship with your thumbs, but which is a lot. It's a lot more than

06:06.720 --> 06:13.680
you would think. Yeah. I mean, look at Billy Mitchell. But I think that this is a good time

06:13.680 --> 06:18.800
for you to make your egress from this situation. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's a great word for it.

06:19.360 --> 06:26.560
Situation. That's the thing is like there is no end to this. That's not messy. It has. You have

06:26.560 --> 06:35.920
been you have been foisted against your will into a situation. Yeah. I'm an messy, messy, messy

06:35.920 --> 06:40.320
situation. And I would say even outside the moral ambiguity, like, get out of it because you're

06:40.320 --> 06:46.080
better than that. Like, this is an engaged dude that, you know, he's taking out all of his, you

06:46.080 --> 06:53.760
know, whatever fear of the future with his fiance with you. He's using you. If you're in for like

06:53.760 --> 07:01.760
the excitement of a good sext, like maybe start sexting your bank, you know. Now that that sex

07:01.760 --> 07:07.600
the sex, the time and temperature line at your bank so that you don't have to, you know, you

07:07.600 --> 07:13.120
don't have to deal with that, that moral shadiness. You can still get your still get your, you know,

07:13.120 --> 07:17.440
your rocks off. Do you think that just like they're like phone sex lines, that there are

07:17.440 --> 07:22.560
phone sex lines that people are working on where you can like sex something and they sex you back

07:22.560 --> 07:28.400
and but it's just a little bit. Absolutely. Absolutely. It's all all computer generated.

07:28.400 --> 07:34.480
You know, it's true. Oh, you are fine. You're completely texting with a robot that is learning

07:34.480 --> 07:42.560
and adapting and you're texting their uncanny valley. Right. Execute yourself from this

07:42.560 --> 07:51.200
situation. Also, just to clarify something, if you find out that someone is engaged, the gray zone,

07:51.200 --> 07:56.960
if it ever existed between flirty texting and sexting completely disappears. If you would not

07:56.960 --> 08:02.880
show it's like, you know, it's a sin if you wouldn't do it in front of Jesus. Like if you

08:02.880 --> 08:10.400
if the fiance would look at what you guys are doing and say and get infuriated, then that's

08:10.400 --> 08:15.680
that's cheating. That's sexting. And this guy, I think, knows exactly what he's done. If it's

08:15.680 --> 08:22.080
taking him four months to tell you that he's engaged. Yeah. And he you're too great. That's

08:22.080 --> 08:27.600
what I'm saying. He's begging for you to help. Guys are stupid. He's begging for you to help him

08:27.600 --> 08:33.120
get out of this because he he sees no solution. He's like he's like a rat in a maze. He's he's

08:33.120 --> 08:38.400
begging for you to lead him, lead him to daylight, which you can do and save face and be totally

08:38.400 --> 08:45.040
cool. And more importantly, like feel good about it in after the short term sort of bummer. You

08:45.040 --> 08:50.640
will look back on the situation, think, gosh, Darlene, you were really responsible there. And

08:50.640 --> 08:56.400
and that's pretty great of you. And I think this is just like any situation when somebody is like,

08:56.400 --> 08:59.760
I really like this girl, but she's dating this guy. They're really unhappy. They're probably

08:59.760 --> 09:04.880
going to break up. You don't want to be the catalyst that makes anything happen here.

09:04.880 --> 09:08.960
It puts way too much pressure on you. And you don't want you don't want Joey Greco kicking

09:08.960 --> 09:13.680
down your door, taking your phone and throwing it into the street because he'll do it. That's

09:13.680 --> 09:17.920
his new thing. Is that his thing? I haven't seen that thing yet. It's called e-cheaters.

09:18.560 --> 09:22.240
And actually, you'll get a text from a number you don't recognize saying, gotcha, bitch.

09:22.240 --> 09:26.160
And then he takes your phone, he throws it in the street and yells cheaters.

09:27.280 --> 09:34.480
Then he zooms in on it real close. I mean, this all, all of our advice right now sort of precludes

09:34.480 --> 09:41.200
the like, we can't account for the possibility that the fiance is like the worst person on earth

09:41.200 --> 09:46.960
and he really needs to leave her. But it goes back to what Travis said. If that is the situation,

09:46.960 --> 09:54.800
he needs to leave her and then get back in contact with you. Like you don't he should have done that

09:54.800 --> 10:02.080
from in the first place. And and you need to let him sort of get his situation sorted out. It may

10:02.080 --> 10:06.960
be that you're his special one and he's your special one, but he needs to be a grown up in

10:06.960 --> 10:11.280
that other relationship first. And then and then you guys can can go back to whatever weird thing

10:11.280 --> 10:16.720
you're doing that didn't exist when I was your age. Hey, you want to Yahoo to wash the palette of

10:16.720 --> 10:22.640
weirdness out of our mouth? Yeah. This Yahoo is not that our not that our dear listener is weird.

10:22.640 --> 10:28.000
The guy's weird. Yeah, everything. Everything. Everything is weird. This one was sent in by

10:28.000 --> 10:37.120
Emily Smith Dicks. Thank you, Emily. Don't lie. That's a woman's name. Okay. Sorry. Try again.

10:37.120 --> 10:45.200
Emily Smith Dicks asks Justin, I won't not this time. Not this third time that you say it. I won't

10:45.200 --> 10:51.920
I will not giggle. Thank you, Emily. It's by Yahoo answers user like IDK who asks,

10:53.280 --> 11:00.640
starting a Jedi braid. So I am planning on growing a Jedi braid. And I know it is behind

11:00.640 --> 11:06.800
the right ear. But IDK exactly where is it right on the bone? But should I let the let it grow on

11:06.800 --> 11:11.920
its own or put extensions on it till it is long enough to be braided? And then he's included a

11:11.920 --> 11:17.920
picture of you and McGregor with the braid. And you're assuming this is a guy asking this question?

11:19.360 --> 11:25.440
I'm assuming I'm assuming as much if it's I think if a lady Jedi has a braid, it's it's

11:26.000 --> 11:33.360
it's just a braid. Here's the number one thing and I and I tell this to people so often and they

11:33.360 --> 11:39.680
never listen. But it is key and it's gonna feel uncomfortable. You can't wash it for the first

11:39.680 --> 11:46.000
Mm hmm. Three to four months. Just let your natural hair oils. It's really not about growing

11:46.000 --> 11:51.760
a piece of hair so much as it's about just letting your spirit sort of become unchained

11:52.320 --> 12:00.400
from corporatism. It's a it's a it's a commitment to the Jedi lifestyle. Right. And your own

12:00.400 --> 12:06.400
spiritual oneness like just don't wash it. Your hair naturally wants to grow you a Jedi braid.

12:06.400 --> 12:11.360
You've got to let that happen. What a lot of people don't know is they think that that is hair,

12:11.360 --> 12:15.840
but actually it's an extension of the brain growing externally through the skull. No,

12:15.840 --> 12:20.480
it's not that it's now that I'm almost certain it is. I know a lot about both Jedi's and science,

12:20.480 --> 12:25.440
you guys. But a lot of people really don't know is that you also got to just let that

12:25.440 --> 12:33.200
just let that Bush go crazy. Jedi Bush. That is a Jedi style that a lot of people a lot of people

12:33.200 --> 12:40.560
don't know about. Old Obi Wan Kenobi. It was like the it's like the forests of Dantooine down there.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.440
You want it to be so whack down there that when you drop your pants,

12:45.440 --> 12:47.920
everyone in the room says, that is not what I'm looking for.

12:50.400 --> 12:55.600
That is not the Bush I'm looking for. Thank you. I that situation is not in any way what I'm

12:55.600 --> 13:02.000
looking for. So you've got to have a braid down there. And you said that jokingly, but you know

13:02.000 --> 13:07.200
it's braid. Mm hmm. Which you know what that means. Jedi can't wear shorts. What's that coming out?

13:07.200 --> 13:12.880
What is that thing at your knee, dad? Oh, no. Do you want to go to the desert planet? Fuck. Again.

13:13.520 --> 13:24.000
Fuck. Just put on some cargos. You'll be fine. I can't. Stupid braided Bush. It's not only that

13:24.000 --> 13:31.280
it's not only the worst look, right? It's the worst explanation of a look that you can. I think

13:31.280 --> 13:37.360
if I had this thing, I would rather say, oh, it's a rat tail. I just honestly was just thinking of a

13:37.360 --> 13:42.080
rat tail. I have a rat tail because I'm a dirty boy, which I think is better than, oh, it's my

13:42.080 --> 13:47.600
Jedi braid. I'm at the academy. It's an unrated. It's an unrated Jedi braid. Can we start calling

13:47.600 --> 13:52.720
rat tails, lazy Jedis? That's basically what it is. If you braided that up, you would have you

13:52.720 --> 13:56.800
would be one with the force. But instead, you're just going to watch. Here's the thing about the

13:56.800 --> 14:00.800
rat tail, though, and the difference between the Jedi braid and the rat tail is it's like you said,

14:00.800 --> 14:05.680
you know, it's a really unattractive look. The rat tail, you know, really help if I just took it

14:05.680 --> 14:12.000
90 degrees to the left. Yeah. You know, like, why is putting something on the side off like,

14:12.000 --> 14:18.320
hey, man, fear leads to hate, man. Hate leads to anger, buddy. Do you know?

14:21.600 --> 14:27.280
Don't do this thing. You're thinking I'm doing. Are you a Jedi? Because I will assure you that

14:27.280 --> 14:33.440
in the in the wide pantheon of the Jedi lifestyle, that's dumb hair thing is pretty low on the list.

14:33.440 --> 14:38.640
Yeah. Like all the OB wasn't even rocking it. There are several other steps that are more

14:38.640 --> 14:43.680
important to the Jedi life. Yes. Windu didn't have a dumb braid. Mr. It didn't have any hair

14:43.680 --> 14:49.360
except for the bush. Is that is the policy that you only have it when you're Patty one?

14:50.160 --> 14:56.640
I think that's I think that's what it is. Is that the thing by like 900 years old that that Yoda

14:56.640 --> 15:02.400
just had like the most rock and bush? I imagine Yoda was half bush under there.

15:06.560 --> 15:11.280
60% of his body mass was bush. Well, just put it this way. If he fell forward,

15:11.280 --> 15:18.960
he would bounce like a gummy bear. It's complete. It's complete. But spring really well groomed.

15:18.960 --> 15:27.680
It's like a fucking topiary. It's beautiful. I can't wait for Star Wars 3D. We're finally

15:27.680 --> 15:32.880
going to get the kind of depth that we need to finally peep that bush. It's going to look like

15:32.880 --> 15:39.440
you're buried in an avalanche. It's going to be amazing. Oh, guys. Chewbacca. He's like all bush.

15:40.320 --> 15:42.800
We didn't even think about that. I guess he's not a Jedi, though.

15:42.800 --> 15:52.800
Hmm. Tricky. Let's how can we make this joke work for us? He is a dog. Do they let dogs be Jedi's?

15:53.440 --> 15:57.600
I don't see why not. They seem like a pretty inclusive organization.

15:58.800 --> 16:04.800
Hey, my issue. This person. I like this person. They get right to it.

16:04.800 --> 16:10.000
My issue is whether or not I'm dating this girl. So full stop. Full stop.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.440
So it's for two months now, this girl now and I have been seeing each other once a week.

16:16.400 --> 16:21.680
But when we hang out, it's usually outside somewhere, really just chilling. My problem is,

16:21.680 --> 16:27.120
I can't figure out whether we're dating or not. Some of my friends say no, this isn't. Some say

16:27.120 --> 16:33.040
we are. I really like this girl a lot. If this is considered dating, then I think I'll make a move

16:33.040 --> 16:40.320
to further our relationship. Thanks, brothers. I look forward to hearing your guys' advice on this.

16:40.320 --> 16:48.080
That's from Gmail. If you don't know, you probably aren't at this moment.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.480
Once a week is a lot, though, isn't it?

16:50.480 --> 16:52.160
I mean, it's a lot.

16:52.160 --> 16:57.840
Yeah, but here's the thing. No offense, question asker from Gmail. You don't give us any context

16:57.840 --> 17:01.520
to what this once a week hanging out is. It could be like a study session.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.440
No, it is outside.

17:03.440 --> 17:07.040
So they play Ultimate together. They're on an Ultimate team.

17:07.040 --> 17:10.080
They could be sitting in the quad playing guitars for money.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.760
That's right, Travis. They could be buskers.

17:15.760 --> 17:17.120
They could be troubadours.

17:18.560 --> 17:25.280
They could be gardeners at a mansion. They could be farmers outside together.

17:25.840 --> 17:29.680
These are all out. They could hang glide together, tandem.

17:29.680 --> 17:34.240
Maybe one of them is a hang glider. Maybe one of them is a statue.

17:35.520 --> 17:40.320
The other one sits under the statue. This email comes to us from a hang glider.

17:41.680 --> 17:42.640
You dummy.

17:44.720 --> 17:48.640
Hey, this is weird. A hang glider is that thing you use to hang glide?

17:48.640 --> 17:50.400
What do you call a person who does it?

17:51.200 --> 17:52.000
Hang glidest.

17:52.000 --> 18:02.000
Hang gliderino. This is why you just got to ask.

18:02.000 --> 18:06.560
You just got to escalate. If you don't escalate, how are we supposed to?

18:06.560 --> 18:08.800
You're not going to know unless you try to escalate.

18:08.800 --> 18:14.160
Halfway between escalate and just ask, you'll find a little thing called escalate.

18:14.160 --> 18:17.520
That's what you got to do. You got to escalate this.

18:17.520 --> 18:19.520
Let's break this down mathematically.

18:19.520 --> 18:24.320
Two months, once a week, you've been on eight dates, hypothetically, right?

18:24.320 --> 18:30.400
If by eight dates, you have not done some kind of physical contact, hand holding, a kiss, something,

18:30.400 --> 18:35.120
you're not dating, but you're not dating, right?

18:37.120 --> 18:41.600
I'm saying there's been no indication to you. There's been no physical contact,

18:41.600 --> 18:46.720
no flirting, making plans for the future. What are we going to do in two weeks?

18:46.720 --> 18:48.320
Maybe there is physical contact.

18:48.320 --> 18:50.080
I mean, maybe there is physical contact.

18:50.080 --> 18:53.360
He just didn't say whether or not there was physical contact.

18:53.360 --> 18:57.520
They might be doing like mad butt stuff. They might have jumped right to butt stuff.

18:57.520 --> 19:00.080
If you're doing just all kinds of butt stuff, you're dating.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.520
You're dating, right?

19:01.520 --> 19:04.160
You're either dating or you're a real tramp.

19:04.160 --> 19:05.760
Should we specify the stuff?

19:06.800 --> 19:08.000
Like butt stamping.

19:11.920 --> 19:12.640
Moon landing.

19:15.120 --> 19:15.680
Diapers.

19:16.400 --> 19:17.360
Lassoing it.

19:17.360 --> 19:18.240
Lasso butts.

19:19.040 --> 19:20.000
Booty chews.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.200
Booty chews.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.640
Did you say booty chews?

19:24.160 --> 19:25.360
Beetle juice.

19:25.360 --> 19:26.960
Beetle juice, booty chews.

19:27.680 --> 19:28.720
Moon chews.

19:28.720 --> 19:29.760
Spankerinos.

19:29.760 --> 19:30.320
All of that.

19:31.440 --> 19:32.480
Upside down noogies.

19:36.080 --> 19:37.360
The Chilean miner.

19:37.360 --> 19:38.480
Like whatever.

19:38.480 --> 19:39.680
All that stuff.

19:39.680 --> 19:41.520
I've been dating you for 60 days.

19:44.160 --> 19:44.960
Okay.

19:44.960 --> 19:46.240
Who got eliminated on Idol?

19:46.240 --> 19:51.280
If you guys have not had any physical contact, I'm going to pass judgment and say that you're not dating.

19:51.280 --> 19:56.480
If you have, then you're really bad at missing cues and you are dating and it's time to escalate.

19:56.480 --> 19:59.760
Either way, you got to escalate it because one of two things will happen.

20:00.480 --> 20:03.600
Either they'll say, no, we're not dating.

20:03.600 --> 20:03.920
Okay.

20:03.920 --> 20:04.480
That's good.

20:04.480 --> 20:05.920
That wraps that situation up.

20:05.920 --> 20:07.280
Would you like to go on a date?

20:07.280 --> 20:08.560
We could do that together.

20:08.560 --> 20:09.840
We seem to enjoy each other's company.

20:09.840 --> 20:12.160
That is a thing that could happen physically.

20:12.160 --> 20:19.360
And then, you know, if it turns out you are dating, you might look a little foolish, but she's already into you.

20:19.360 --> 20:20.080
Yeah.

20:20.080 --> 20:22.560
It is a no-loss scenario.

20:24.560 --> 20:31.360
And if you're together forever, then any one thing that you do doesn't matter in the fullness of time.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.160
Right.

20:32.160 --> 20:32.720
Exactly.

20:33.760 --> 20:37.280
Maybe it's possible she's wondering the same thing.

20:37.280 --> 20:38.080
I know it's scary.

20:38.080 --> 20:39.440
Or maybe she's not.

20:39.440 --> 20:40.560
She might not be.

20:40.560 --> 20:44.480
Or maybe she's not. She might not be wondering that because she's a scarecrow.

20:46.320 --> 20:48.800
It turns out she is a scarecrow.

20:49.360 --> 20:49.680
She is.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.960
I was looking for a geocache.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.320
I found it inside of her and we struck up a conversation.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.480
We've been talking ever since.

20:58.480 --> 20:59.360
Ever since.

20:59.360 --> 21:00.640
But geocaching.

21:00.640 --> 21:01.280
That's another one.

21:02.240 --> 21:04.800
Butt-caching is what you're looking for.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.240
Guys, speaking of butt.

21:06.240 --> 21:08.640
And doing the dirty scarecrow.

21:08.640 --> 21:10.960
This yahoo is sent in by Brynn. Thank you Brynn.

21:10.960 --> 21:14.560
It's by yahoo answers user Kayla who asks, help me with my butt problem.

21:15.200 --> 21:16.160
Oh no.

21:16.160 --> 21:18.720
Well, this may sound quite awkward in some ways.

21:18.720 --> 21:21.520
But I tried to squeeze my butt cheeks as hard as I could.

21:21.520 --> 21:22.080
God.

21:22.080 --> 21:24.000
And now my butt is really sore.

21:24.000 --> 21:24.640
Oh.

21:24.640 --> 21:27.360
Is this some kind of exercise or did I hurt myself?

21:27.920 --> 21:28.800
Butt kegels.

21:30.960 --> 21:37.520
I really like that our sort of world is at a point right now that someone could A,

21:37.520 --> 21:39.280
accidentally do exercise.

21:39.920 --> 21:44.480
B, be terrified at the consequences of said exercise.

21:44.480 --> 21:51.040
C, not be able to identify whether or not exercise had in front of her.

21:51.040 --> 21:52.800
Oh, is this exercise?

21:52.800 --> 21:54.160
What a possible world.

21:55.280 --> 21:59.120
Explain to me why one would squeeze their butt cheeks together as hard as they could

21:59.120 --> 22:01.040
that wasn't exercise.

22:01.040 --> 22:02.800
Maybe they were trying to figure out what exercise.

22:02.800 --> 22:05.200
It's like backing into exercise.

22:05.200 --> 22:06.320
I don't know any exercise.

22:06.320 --> 22:07.120
Literally.

22:07.120 --> 22:08.080
I'm going to do things.

22:08.080 --> 22:10.160
Yeah, I want to do things until they hurt.

22:11.440 --> 22:13.600
And then I'm assuming that will have exercised me.

22:14.720 --> 22:16.160
I will say this, though.

22:16.160 --> 22:20.880
From the first half of the question, I squeezed my butt cheeks together as hard as I could.

22:20.880 --> 22:24.320
I was expecting so many worse things that now they're sore.

22:24.320 --> 22:27.520
Like I think that the question askers to be happy that they're just sore.

22:27.520 --> 22:27.840
Yeah.

22:27.840 --> 22:28.480
Yeah.

22:28.480 --> 22:31.440
Not like I pulled something and now I'll never be able to poop again.

22:31.440 --> 22:35.120
I mean, from help me with my butt problem.

22:35.120 --> 22:40.080
There are so, so many other butt problems you could have that would be worse than this.

22:40.080 --> 22:41.040
I think we can agree.

22:41.040 --> 22:42.960
You got off pretty easy here.

22:42.960 --> 22:43.360
Yeah.

22:43.360 --> 22:45.680
Pretty light as far as butt problems go.

22:45.680 --> 22:48.080
You could have like fused them together permanently.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.160
That is not a thing.

22:50.160 --> 22:50.800
That's true.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.400
Justin, that's true.

22:52.400 --> 22:54.000
Yeah, they call it sphere butt.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.920
When Amelia Westves made that nerd have sphere butt.

22:58.480 --> 23:03.920
Did you guys hear about that when Mitt Romney in school taped that kid's butt cheeks together?

23:03.920 --> 23:05.680
When he got detention.

23:06.960 --> 23:09.600
But the other guys on the wrestling team cheered him on the whole time.

23:10.960 --> 23:13.760
He's under just so much pressure from his dad, I guess.

23:13.760 --> 23:16.400
But also Mitt Romney can put on lipstick with his boobs.

23:18.800 --> 23:21.200
Mitt Romney eats sandwiches with cereal on them.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.400
What's up with that?

23:22.400 --> 23:23.360
It's craziness.

23:24.720 --> 23:30.000
That story about Mitt Romney doing that thing, I think was terrible.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.360
Pretty much the worst.

23:31.360 --> 23:32.160
Pretty much the worst.

23:32.160 --> 23:37.600
I would say that we're probably none of us are proud of everything we did in high school.

23:38.640 --> 23:41.200
Are you apologizing for Mitt Romney right now?

23:41.200 --> 23:43.200
No, I wanted to make a broader point.

23:43.200 --> 23:48.320
And that's what that when you guys heard the story was anybody else sort of disappointed

23:48.320 --> 23:51.680
that the end of it wasn't and then he turned out to be the Joker.

23:51.680 --> 23:54.560
Like it reads very origin story.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.800
Oh, like the kid that he punished.

23:56.800 --> 23:57.600
Exactly.

23:57.600 --> 23:58.640
He teased.

23:58.640 --> 24:00.160
The kid that he teased turned.

24:00.160 --> 24:04.080
And then as it turns out, he was some butt.

24:05.040 --> 24:07.360
Oh, you're saying like Paul Harvey, like the rest of the story.

24:07.360 --> 24:07.920
Exactly.

24:07.920 --> 24:10.320
And it turned out that was Obama.

24:12.320 --> 24:15.200
And as it turns out, it was Obama, right?

24:15.200 --> 24:17.520
And now you know the rest of the made up story.

24:17.520 --> 24:18.720
It was Muammar Gaddafi.

24:20.000 --> 24:20.500
Who knew?

24:21.520 --> 24:22.720
I was just disappointed.

24:22.720 --> 24:23.760
I like narrative arcs.

24:24.320 --> 24:25.920
I was disappointed it didn't pan out that way.

24:25.920 --> 24:29.280
It turned out he was just just hazing some poor kid.

24:29.280 --> 24:31.680
But I thought it would be cool with the poor kid.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.920
And this seems like a pretty good open window.

24:33.920 --> 24:38.640
Now the poor kid like got psychic powers and burned down his high school during the prom.

24:39.280 --> 24:43.440
Something like that would be great, which I think you were referencing.

24:43.440 --> 24:47.840
I don't know, Carrie, but I really wanted you to be referencing zapped or zapped again.

24:47.840 --> 24:49.200
I was referencing zapped again.

24:49.760 --> 24:50.260
You were?

24:51.200 --> 24:53.120
And they all perished in the fire.

24:54.400 --> 24:56.400
Is that how zapped again is?

24:56.400 --> 24:58.080
Yeah, it's not a very good movie.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.160
Yeah, it sounds like a really good movie.

25:01.440 --> 25:03.520
You know, I'll let you be the judge.

25:03.520 --> 25:03.760
What?

25:04.320 --> 25:07.200
OK, so imagine this scene.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.360
You're this child's mother.

25:09.360 --> 25:12.400
You walk in on your child, squeezing their butt cheeks together.

25:13.600 --> 25:14.720
Are they are they?

25:14.720 --> 25:15.840
He was trying to fly.

25:17.840 --> 25:19.760
You ever see that movie, Boy Who Could Fly?

25:19.760 --> 25:21.280
This is about that's what it is.

25:21.280 --> 25:24.240
If you push hard enough, the force just lifts you off the ground.

25:24.240 --> 25:28.560
Do you think that they were just sitting there and they were struck by a fancy like,

25:28.560 --> 25:31.440
Oh, I know what I'll do or that's a time to kill.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.840
Do you think they really prep for this?

25:33.840 --> 25:38.320
You think they put on some sweat bands maybe and got ready to really and maybe left school

25:38.320 --> 25:42.080
a little early to give themselves plenty of time to squeeze their butt cheeks

25:42.080 --> 25:43.360
before their parents got home?

25:44.160 --> 25:45.280
Excuse me, teach.

25:45.760 --> 25:47.920
Can I spend today's class standing?

25:47.920 --> 25:51.360
I am I'm going for a world record this afternoon.

25:51.360 --> 25:52.480
I'm in training.

25:52.480 --> 25:53.600
I'm in training.

25:53.600 --> 25:56.960
I need zero butt pressure until it counts.

25:58.400 --> 25:58.880
I need it.

25:59.600 --> 26:04.320
I need it to feel like like a popped bubble wrap underneath there.

26:04.320 --> 26:06.640
Just like soft and pliant.

26:06.640 --> 26:08.240
Please don't mind the doughnut.

26:08.240 --> 26:09.360
This is training.

26:09.360 --> 26:13.360
This is my training doughnut.

26:13.360 --> 26:14.160
That's right, Sydney.

26:14.160 --> 26:15.600
I don't have hemorrhoids.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.920
This is training doughnut from my butt squeezing.

26:18.640 --> 26:22.480
This is really unfortunate because this probably is a little kid.

26:22.480 --> 26:26.560
Can we get 16 or older for the Internet, please?

26:26.560 --> 26:28.320
Can we can we get a license?

26:29.840 --> 26:35.680
When I have kids, they're going to do dumb shit because I did dumb shit and like I don't

26:35.680 --> 26:38.800
want them going and telling the Internet about the dumb shit that they did.

26:38.800 --> 26:39.440
Better question.

26:40.240 --> 26:44.640
I mean, honest to God, if I had a kid right now, if I had like a 14 year old son and I

26:44.640 --> 26:46.080
was like, what are you going to do today, son?

26:46.080 --> 26:48.960
He was like, well, I'm going to go in my bedroom and squeeze my butt cheeks together.

26:48.960 --> 26:51.280
So I was like, OK, have a great day.

26:51.280 --> 26:52.640
Like I wouldn't stop.

26:52.640 --> 26:54.080
But don't never tell anybody.

26:54.640 --> 26:56.080
Yeah, but go to town.

26:56.080 --> 26:56.880
I mean, it's your life.

26:56.880 --> 26:58.080
I'm not going to tell you what to do.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.360
I'm not the boss of you.

26:59.360 --> 27:04.080
You're never going to know how your body works until you do these kinds of brave experiments.

27:04.080 --> 27:05.600
Just trying to break your butt.

27:05.600 --> 27:07.440
Just don't let your kids on the Internet.

27:07.440 --> 27:10.800
People are just throwing trebuchets of dicks at them.

27:10.800 --> 27:15.680
And like they're just tweeting all of the horrible dumb kids stuff that they do.

27:15.680 --> 27:17.840
Don't let it happen to your kids.

27:17.840 --> 27:21.600
What exactly was the advice that this person was asking for, by the way?

27:21.600 --> 27:23.840
They just wanted to know if this was some sort of exercise.

27:23.840 --> 27:27.600
I'm going to go ahead and say, yeah, you can probably increase the best kind of exercise.

27:27.600 --> 27:28.880
Your butt resistance.

27:28.880 --> 27:31.920
If you can get to a point where you can pick up a pencil with your butt cheeks,

27:32.720 --> 27:34.000
you're a god among men.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.680
I'm at the landing strip.

27:35.680 --> 27:37.440
That doesn't sound extremely difficult.

27:40.240 --> 27:42.400
One step away from being able to pick up singles with your butt.

27:42.400 --> 27:45.520
OK, well, then let's say pick up the pencil and sign your name with it.

27:45.520 --> 27:48.160
Oh, that's incursive?

27:49.200 --> 27:50.880
Well, of course, or else it doesn't count.

27:53.520 --> 27:58.800
We have a lot of sponsors lined up this week for the Money Zone.

27:58.800 --> 28:00.080
I'm excited to get there.

28:00.080 --> 28:05.920
But as long as we're talking about Yahoo Answers, I wanted to draw to your attention.

28:05.920 --> 28:09.920
It's rare that we follow up on questions here at My Brother, My Brother and Me.

28:09.920 --> 28:16.640
But you'll remember last week we heard from a young man named Geof

28:17.280 --> 28:24.160
who had some trouble with his step-dad Ron and used a dog to send messages to him.

28:25.120 --> 28:29.600
And I wanted to just thank Drew M.G. on the Maximum Fun forums.

28:29.600 --> 28:35.200
He went and unearthed another question from Geof that I don't think we need to address.

28:35.200 --> 28:39.920
Yes, but it does help to color in the story a little bit more.

28:39.920 --> 28:40.960
Can we? No, let's.

28:41.680 --> 28:42.560
I haven't read it.

28:42.560 --> 28:43.760
Let's get into it.

28:43.760 --> 28:44.480
You haven't read it?

28:44.480 --> 28:45.840
Well, Griffin, can you read it?

28:45.840 --> 28:48.640
Because I don't think it's legal for me to read a Yahoo Answer.

28:48.640 --> 28:49.360
I don't think it is you.

28:49.360 --> 28:49.860
Let me see.

28:50.640 --> 28:51.360
Oh, shit.

28:52.640 --> 28:54.480
Oh, thank you, Drew M.G. so much.

28:54.480 --> 28:58.320
Geof asks, can my step-dad legally ground me?

29:00.000 --> 29:02.160
I got in trouble and my step-dad Ron grounded me.

29:02.160 --> 29:05.120
Can he legally ground me if he is only my step-dad?

29:06.800 --> 29:09.520
And also, does lying make you stupid?

29:10.320 --> 29:13.440
My step-dad Ron caught me lying and called me disingenuous.

29:14.080 --> 29:16.160
I don't think that lying make you stupid.

29:16.160 --> 29:18.960
I see celebrities who lie all the time and they are famous.

29:18.960 --> 29:20.000
I know it's wrong.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.640
I was just wondering if anyone else thinks it makes you stupid.

29:25.120 --> 29:30.720
I would watch a series of movies about just the relationship between Geof and Ron.

29:30.720 --> 29:35.040
I was just thinking, how is it that Shit My Dad Says is a TV show

29:35.040 --> 29:38.720
and I don't have step-dad Ron and his stupid steps?

29:38.720 --> 29:40.240
Step-dad Ron knows best.

29:42.320 --> 29:46.720
It's like we can watch their relationship develop, right?

29:46.720 --> 29:49.120
It's like, I have this new step-dad.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.240
I stepped out of line.

29:51.280 --> 29:52.640
Can he legally ground me?

29:52.640 --> 29:53.280
Because I don't know.

29:53.280 --> 29:55.120
This is a new scary situation for me.

29:55.120 --> 29:56.320
I'm growing up so fast.

29:56.320 --> 29:56.880
Please help me.

29:56.880 --> 29:57.520
I'm Geof.

29:57.520 --> 30:01.760
And then a couple of days later, he lies to him and he says,

30:02.320 --> 30:05.040
I'm having a hard time making this relationship work.

30:05.040 --> 30:06.480
Does lying make you stupid?

30:06.480 --> 30:07.200
I don't know.

30:07.200 --> 30:07.760
Please help me.

30:07.760 --> 30:09.360
Am I going to become stupid?

30:09.360 --> 30:14.000
And then a few days after that, he asked if he can write messages to his dad on his dog

30:14.000 --> 30:15.360
without making him sick.

30:15.360 --> 30:17.760
In fact, becoming actually pretty stupid.

30:20.560 --> 30:22.240
It's like a whole narrative.

30:22.240 --> 30:24.400
Through Yahoo Answers.

30:24.400 --> 30:28.080
Yahoo Answers, it's the first Yahoo Answers exclusive sitcom.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.160
Oh, Christ.

30:32.160 --> 30:36.720
Well, I don't know what to tell Geof and Ron, but I hope they keep on trucking

30:37.600 --> 30:41.040
because they've certainly filled my life with a lot of joy.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.040
But you know what they haven't filled my life with?

30:43.040 --> 30:55.120
What's that?

30:55.120 --> 30:55.520
Money.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.480
Griffin, who's the first person taking us to the Money Zone this week?

30:59.120 --> 31:05.600
Today, we have WednesdayWolf, whose art you can see at WednesdayWolf.com.

31:05.600 --> 31:09.600
It is, they sell fucked up watercolor paintings.

31:09.600 --> 31:10.880
I have seen these paintings.

31:10.880 --> 31:12.320
I can indeed confirm.

31:12.320 --> 31:13.600
They are pretty fucked up.

31:14.240 --> 31:19.120
But man, there's some awesome ones just right at the top of the page there with Chewbacca

31:19.120 --> 31:21.600
and Yoda and like, they're awesome.

31:21.600 --> 31:25.360
There's a Mario looking more like a human pubis than he ever has before.

31:27.360 --> 31:32.800
But the paintings are really neat and they would look good on a wall of an apartment

31:32.800 --> 31:37.360
or a bathroom or a nursery of a child that you want to just ruin.

31:39.120 --> 31:41.280
Yeah, just for life.

31:41.280 --> 31:43.200
Yeah, but go check it out.

31:43.200 --> 31:44.800
It's WednesdayWolf.com.

31:44.800 --> 31:49.600
I think you're going to like what you see unless you're prone to nightmares.

31:49.600 --> 31:50.400
Day nightmares.

31:51.120 --> 31:51.760
Daymares.

31:52.480 --> 31:54.000
If you're prone to daymares, stay away.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.400
But otherwise, you should get to WednesdayWolf.com.

31:57.600 --> 31:59.200
There's some Pokemon too.

31:59.200 --> 32:00.960
Some really scary Pokemon.

32:00.960 --> 32:01.920
Holy shit.

32:02.480 --> 32:04.720
They've even got my favorite Pokemon, Ghastly.

32:05.600 --> 32:07.440
He looks horrifying.

32:07.440 --> 32:08.560
He looks horrifying.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.640
He looks ghastly, quite literally.

32:10.640 --> 32:12.000
But it's awesome.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.280
You guys got to go take a look.

32:13.280 --> 32:14.160
WednesdayWolf.com.

32:14.160 --> 32:15.200
Just type it in your browser.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.400
Don't think about it.

32:16.400 --> 32:19.920
Justin, tell us about our next sponsor.

32:19.920 --> 32:21.360
The M Submargin Fletch.

32:21.360 --> 32:24.080
If you haven't heard of them, you can go to them.org.

32:24.080 --> 32:30.320
And they're a creative group that spends their time making absurd, this is a quote,

32:30.320 --> 32:35.200
absurd situational photographs to entertain their audience.

32:35.200 --> 32:38.080
They've made some pretty fantastic stuff in the past.

32:38.080 --> 32:43.200
I appreciate, especially Intellectual Dogfight, that features two dogs playing Scrabble,

32:44.080 --> 32:45.760
which makes me really happy.

32:46.640 --> 32:52.880
But they're doing a new series, a sci-fi influenced series called Intergalactic Expansion,

32:52.880 --> 32:54.240
for a show they're going to do in Vienna.

32:54.240 --> 32:57.600
But, and they need your help to make it happen.

32:58.080 --> 33:02.720
You can find the link to this Kickstarter at themps.org.

33:02.720 --> 33:07.440
And if you look at the one photo that they have already put up, if it doesn't make you happy,

33:07.440 --> 33:09.120
I don't know what will.

33:09.120 --> 33:12.960
Your heart has been replaced with a hard lump of hatred.

33:13.840 --> 33:16.080
But you can go and kickstart them.

33:16.080 --> 33:22.800
I'm most excited about a limited edition signed IMPs calendar, good for the year 2022.

33:22.800 --> 33:26.880
Now hold on, they're giving away a limited magician?

33:30.880 --> 33:34.960
Griffin, as you should know by all of our associations with magicians,

33:34.960 --> 33:38.400
they are by definition unlimited.

33:38.400 --> 33:38.880
Okay.

33:38.880 --> 33:43.680
But yeah, you can go to the mps.org and you'll find a link to their kickstart Intergalactic Expansion.

33:43.680 --> 33:45.280
They're going to put the show on in Vienna,

33:45.280 --> 33:49.360
but they will send you cool stuff for helping them to get it mounted.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.200
And it looks fantastic.

33:51.200 --> 33:54.080
And I support more cool things going into the world.

33:54.080 --> 33:55.120
So go check it out.

33:56.400 --> 33:57.920
Speaking of looks fantastic.

34:00.240 --> 34:03.280
Once again, this week, we're sponsored by Mob Rules Games,

34:03.280 --> 34:05.200
the makers of Haunts of the Manson Macabre.

34:05.840 --> 34:07.040
They're working on the Kickstarter.

34:07.040 --> 34:07.760
It's going great.

34:07.760 --> 34:12.000
They've raised about, I would say almost about $11,000 so far.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.600
So they're almost, you know, close to halfway there.

34:16.400 --> 34:21.760
And we're seeing a lot of people go and donate and leave a comment saying that MBMBAM sent them.

34:21.760 --> 34:22.320
So great.

34:22.320 --> 34:23.120
Thank you, guys.

34:23.120 --> 34:25.600
For those of you, maybe you missed a couple of weeks or anything.

34:25.600 --> 34:29.360
Let me read you the description real quick so that you know what you're missing out on.

34:29.360 --> 34:33.440
Manson Macabre is a turn-based horror game that allows you to play either side of the haunting.

34:33.440 --> 34:37.040
So you can either be the explorers or the denizens haunting the house.

34:38.480 --> 34:42.000
We they spent so far $42,000 on development,

34:42.000 --> 34:45.120
and they just need another $20,000 to see it through to completion.

34:45.120 --> 34:49.520
Mob Rules Games believes that transparent business practices are vital to earning your trust

34:49.520 --> 34:54.240
and will make your budget, expenses and sales and schedule publicly available.

34:54.240 --> 34:57.360
So every single thing they do, you can go and see.

34:57.360 --> 34:59.360
There's no, you know, hidden agenda.

34:59.360 --> 35:00.960
There's it's completely transparent.

35:00.960 --> 35:04.560
Every $5 that you pledge earns you a copy of the game.

35:04.560 --> 35:08.800
So if you give $5, then you get a free copy of the game whenever it comes out.

35:08.800 --> 35:13.280
If you donate $25, then you get five copies of the game to give to your friends or,

35:13.280 --> 35:15.760
as they encourage you to do, sell it.

35:15.760 --> 35:19.120
You can sell it and make some extra cash off of your $5.

35:19.120 --> 35:22.960
I think it's one of the best marketing tools ever to say, hey, pirate our stuff.

35:23.920 --> 35:24.720
Don't pirate.

35:24.720 --> 35:25.280
Don't pirate.

35:25.280 --> 35:25.840
No, no, no, no, no.

35:25.840 --> 35:28.160
Pay for it.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.120
Profiteer.

35:29.120 --> 35:29.680
Profiteer.

35:29.680 --> 35:30.080
Thank you.

35:31.200 --> 35:31.760
And their goal is-

35:31.760 --> 35:32.880
Highway robbery with our stuff.

35:32.880 --> 35:34.080
Highway robbery their stuff.

35:34.080 --> 35:36.720
Their goal is to get it out in time for Halloween this year.

35:37.440 --> 35:44.000
So there's, I believe, about another 30 days or another 45 days left in their Kickstarter.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.680
So make sure you go check it out.

35:45.680 --> 35:47.280
It's mobrulesgames.com.

35:47.920 --> 35:49.360
They have links there to the Kickstarter.

35:49.360 --> 35:50.880
So make sure to go check out their stuff.

35:50.880 --> 35:52.720
It looks amazing.

35:52.720 --> 35:58.640
It's kind of Edgar Allan Poe-inspired Edward Gorey stuff.

35:58.640 --> 35:59.920
It looks awesome.

35:59.920 --> 36:00.960
So make sure you check it out.

36:01.680 --> 36:03.280
mobrulesgames.com.

36:04.400 --> 36:10.560
Last up in the money zone this week is Travis.

36:10.560 --> 36:10.960
Hit me.

36:11.520 --> 36:15.680
Well, it's a little TV show pilot called Don't Take This the Wrong Way.

36:15.680 --> 36:17.760
People are still watching TV?

36:17.760 --> 36:18.320
I know.

36:18.320 --> 36:19.760
It's amazing, right?

36:19.760 --> 36:22.720
It's just Everybody Loves Raymond Again.

36:23.360 --> 36:23.920
That's the only TV show I know of.

36:23.920 --> 36:28.880
It's basically like Everybody Loves Raymond Again, only better if you can believe it.

36:28.880 --> 36:32.960
And it's a pilot developed by Craig Lewis and Matthew Chandler.

36:34.320 --> 36:35.600
They're friends from college.

36:35.600 --> 36:38.320
They've worked together since 2002.

36:38.320 --> 36:40.000
And so basically they're working on this show.

36:40.640 --> 36:46.000
They describe it as a combination of The League, which is a show on FX,

36:46.000 --> 36:50.080
and a younger half hour version of Men of a Certain Age.

36:50.080 --> 36:51.600
Men of a Younger Age.

36:51.600 --> 36:52.560
Men of a Certain Age.

36:52.560 --> 36:54.800
That's not the age that the men are on the show.

36:55.680 --> 36:58.400
Maybe Men of a Funnier Age?

36:58.400 --> 37:00.800
Men of a Younger More Accessible Age.

37:00.800 --> 37:04.160
Men of an Age where there are fewer jokes about prostate cancer.

37:04.160 --> 37:05.520
All their boners still work.

37:05.520 --> 37:07.280
More jokes about iPods.

37:08.800 --> 37:10.080
I had to go to my doctor.

37:10.080 --> 37:12.160
He put his finger on my butt and found an iPod.

37:13.360 --> 37:13.600
Cool.

37:13.600 --> 37:16.000
Men of a Younger Age.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.600
Kickstart it.

37:18.480 --> 37:21.920
They've been working on the script for a couple years now, and they've reached a point where

37:21.920 --> 37:22.960
they're ready to film it.

37:22.960 --> 37:27.200
And they want to just grab that bull by the horns and wrestle it to the ground and film

37:27.200 --> 37:28.160
that whole process.

37:28.160 --> 37:28.800
Fuck that bull.

37:30.080 --> 37:30.800
Fuck that bull.

37:31.760 --> 37:38.880
So basically, you know, they just need $18,000 for development, shooting, post-production.

37:38.880 --> 37:43.600
Indiegogo.com forward slash wrong way is where you can see a clip with the guys.

37:43.600 --> 37:45.760
You can hear a little bit about more about the show.

37:46.640 --> 37:48.240
And this is very exciting.

37:48.240 --> 37:53.840
If you mentioned my brother, my brother and me, okay, and not, and I can't stress this

37:53.840 --> 37:57.120
enough, not Jordan, Jesse Goh, my brother, my brother and me.

37:58.160 --> 38:04.880
If we bring more people into their, into their donor pile, then they're going to-

38:05.520 --> 38:07.520
Their writhing pile of donors.

38:07.520 --> 38:10.000
Their writhing, nightmarish pile.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.560
Their daymarish pile of watercolor donors.

38:13.600 --> 38:16.080
Watercolor donors is an awesome band name.

38:16.080 --> 38:27.680
Yeah, by the way, it is, then we will get into an episode, a mention of us, some oblique

38:27.680 --> 38:31.520
reference that only people who enjoy our program will appreciate.

38:31.520 --> 38:35.600
Right now, across the internet globe, Jordan and Jesse are talking about this show.

38:36.320 --> 38:36.560
Right.

38:36.560 --> 38:39.600
And they're great and all, but we're, we're killing it.

38:39.600 --> 38:40.640
They're phoning it in.

38:40.640 --> 38:41.600
We're killing it.

38:41.600 --> 38:46.400
So we need you guys to go and prove that by mentioning us more than them so that we can

38:46.400 --> 38:48.000
get in the episode and not them.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.560
Again, it's Indiegogo.com forward slash wrong way.

38:50.560 --> 38:56.640
Go support those guys, but most importantly, help get us into something, but even more

38:56.640 --> 39:00.320
importantly, keep Jordan and Jesse from getting into something.

39:00.320 --> 39:03.040
Just help us crush our friends, Jordan and Jesse.

39:03.840 --> 39:05.600
Help us crush our foes in opposition.

39:05.600 --> 39:09.200
Uh, so anyway, that is all.

39:09.200 --> 39:11.440
Those are all our sponsors this week.

39:11.440 --> 39:19.120
Unless I'm mistaken, Griffin, um, that is a song you are going to weave together to craft

39:19.120 --> 39:19.120
together.

39:19.120 --> 39:21.120
I'm so fucking angry right now.

39:21.120 --> 39:21.600
So let's see.

39:21.600 --> 39:29.680
You got to get, uh, wednesdaywolf.com, theimps.org, mobrulesgames.com, and indiegogo.com wrong

39:29.680 --> 39:29.680
way.

39:29.680 --> 39:31.920
Actually, Mob Rules Games will, will, will-

39:31.920 --> 39:33.280
I already busted one out for them.

39:33.280 --> 39:38.080
I'll, I will give them a final draft of that come, come the end of this promotion.

39:38.080 --> 39:39.760
So it's don't take this the wrong way.

39:39.760 --> 39:41.440
The Imps and Wednesday Wolf.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.960
I like the idea of Daymare Pile of watercolor donors.

39:44.960 --> 39:45.920
I like that part.

39:45.920 --> 39:47.280
So far so good.

39:47.280 --> 39:48.000
Okay.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Um, what does that cover?

39:50.000 --> 39:52.400
That covers Wednesday Wolf and the Imp.

39:53.600 --> 39:54.640
It covers all three.

39:54.640 --> 39:55.520
They all want money.

39:56.480 --> 39:57.280
That's the connector.

39:57.280 --> 39:58.240
Everybody wants money.

39:58.240 --> 40:06.960
Here we go.

40:06.960 --> 40:11.840
Build a Daymare Pile of watercolor donors.

40:11.840 --> 40:14.720
All these businesses need funds to operate.

40:16.480 --> 40:18.880
You can help Wednesday Wolf.

40:18.880 --> 40:21.680
The Imps don't take the wrong way.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.600
That's almost what it's called.

40:23.600 --> 40:26.000
But I ran out of words in the verse.

40:26.000 --> 40:34.320
Go give them some cash to chase all of their dreams around.

40:37.040 --> 40:37.760
Whoa.

40:37.760 --> 40:40.000
I like how it ended on some of that unresolved.

40:40.000 --> 40:43.120
Dreams of dreams.

40:45.680 --> 40:46.560
I don't know guys.

40:48.880 --> 40:55.120
Build a Daymare Pile of watercolor donors.

40:55.120 --> 40:58.400
You need to give these people lots of cash.

41:00.080 --> 41:02.480
That's how the market works.

41:02.480 --> 41:05.760
They take your money and turn it into goods and services.

41:05.760 --> 41:09.040
And you can take those services to the bank.

41:10.880 --> 41:13.280
While they take your literal money to the bank.

41:16.400 --> 41:18.480
Visit WednesdayWolf.com.

41:18.480 --> 41:19.280
TheImps.org.

41:19.280 --> 41:20.960
And don't take this the wrong way's website,

41:20.960 --> 41:25.680
which you can probably find on Google.

41:29.680 --> 41:30.320
Oh man.

41:31.680 --> 41:36.400
I think the real contest is to find which way of spending your money

41:36.400 --> 41:39.680
your grandparents who lived in the depression would approve of the list.

41:44.720 --> 41:46.880
And it's to buy messages on our show.

41:47.440 --> 41:47.840
Yes.

41:47.840 --> 41:48.800
Surprise.

41:48.800 --> 41:49.840
Big twist.

41:49.840 --> 41:52.800
It's giving us money that they would really approve of the lease.

41:53.760 --> 41:55.680
Hey, I recently met a girl that's wonderful.

41:55.680 --> 41:56.800
We have a lot in common.

41:56.800 --> 41:59.760
She has expressed interest in dating me and it's mutual.

42:00.480 --> 42:03.600
I worry though that in a year when I'm finished college,

42:03.600 --> 42:07.120
I will likely have to move a pretty large distance to start my career.

42:08.160 --> 42:11.440
I also worry that she wants to start a family sooner than I do.

42:12.080 --> 42:13.120
Is this a deal breaker?

42:13.680 --> 42:15.920
Should I just stay single yet another year?

42:15.920 --> 42:17.760
That's from concerning Canada.

42:17.760 --> 42:19.040
Oh man.

42:19.040 --> 42:20.320
Of course not.

42:20.320 --> 42:21.360
Of course not.

42:21.360 --> 42:27.600
Anytime you start a sentence with I'm worried that in a year just stop right there

42:27.600 --> 42:31.600
and finish the question with should I just stay single yet another year?

42:32.320 --> 42:34.640
Yeah, like no, of course not.

42:34.640 --> 42:38.000
Quetzalcoatl is coming for you and me and everyone you love.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.720
And it's December 21st this year.

42:40.720 --> 42:42.240
So no, I wouldn't.

42:42.240 --> 42:45.120
Hey Quetzalcoatl, can I get just like a short extension?

42:45.120 --> 42:47.280
Is it cool if let's just I'll tell you what,

42:47.280 --> 42:50.480
let me pencil you in for like March 014.

42:50.480 --> 42:52.560
Oh no, you're a giant Thunderbird.

42:52.560 --> 42:53.280
We're all dead.

42:53.920 --> 42:55.920
So thanks for the slow pitch.

42:56.560 --> 42:58.800
Ask this girl out immediately.

42:58.800 --> 43:00.240
Yeah, you have no time.

43:00.240 --> 43:02.960
You have to, everybody needs to live like Quetzalcoatl's coming back.

43:02.960 --> 43:04.720
Yeah, don't even bother with birth control anymore

43:04.720 --> 43:06.320
because we are less than nine months out.

43:07.360 --> 43:08.720
Don't even go to the dentist.

43:08.720 --> 43:10.080
Don't even get your teeth checked.

43:10.080 --> 43:11.040
That's bullshit.

43:11.040 --> 43:13.920
You don't want to get eradicated when you're six months pregnant though.

43:13.920 --> 43:16.240
That's that your back's going to be hurt.

43:16.240 --> 43:17.440
Life begins at inception.

43:17.440 --> 43:18.080
That's true.

43:18.080 --> 43:19.040
Weird cravings.

43:19.680 --> 43:23.120
What if you get a weird craving to talk back to Quetzalcoatl?

43:23.120 --> 43:25.840
Then you're going to die, you know, die a lot earlier.

43:25.840 --> 43:27.440
I mean, yeah, I mean, it's six and one.

43:27.440 --> 43:28.640
You're going to live in his service.

43:28.640 --> 43:29.280
Oh, yeah.

43:31.200 --> 43:31.760
Oh, yeah.

43:33.600 --> 43:36.720
Honey, listen, I know this is going to sound weird.

43:37.360 --> 43:41.440
I have a craving for a stew made from the feathers of Quetzalcoatl.

43:41.440 --> 43:43.280
I need you to fetch them from here.

43:43.280 --> 43:46.720
And then just a picture of like the dude driving in a minivan grumbling.

43:47.360 --> 43:52.400
I was just in the middle of the game and now I got to go get some feathers of Quetzalcoatl.

43:52.400 --> 43:55.920
His nest of bones into the Tower of Death Corpses.

43:56.480 --> 43:59.200
That he's formed over where the White House used to be.

44:01.200 --> 44:08.000
The watercolor pile of day rare corpses he's made and now he lives atop.

44:08.000 --> 44:16.080
Listen, in a year, what you want, if this is the person, the one, the person, the special person

44:16.080 --> 44:21.360
that's going to change your whole path in a year, here's what you will want to be with them.

44:21.360 --> 44:23.840
And the other stuff you can figure out.

44:23.840 --> 44:30.080
Like it, you don't know what you want because you are only living half of your life right now.

44:30.080 --> 44:34.000
If this is the special person that you're going to beautiful justice.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.640
Yeah, that's fucking gorgeous.

44:36.640 --> 44:40.240
That's pretty unless you're like a fucking Hallmark card, right?

44:42.000 --> 44:48.080
You don't honestly everything changes when you enter into a committed

44:48.720 --> 44:50.160
permanent relationship with somebody.

44:50.880 --> 44:51.920
Here's the thing, though.

44:51.920 --> 44:53.840
Like I agree with you, Justin.

44:53.840 --> 44:57.840
And the other aspect is anything could happen in a year.

44:57.840 --> 44:59.600
Like maybe you guys get together.

45:00.160 --> 45:01.280
It's great for three months.

45:01.280 --> 45:02.240
It doesn't work out.

45:02.240 --> 45:03.200
It ends.

45:03.200 --> 45:03.920
Okay, great.

45:03.920 --> 45:09.440
But to say because of something happening a year away, I'm not even going to give it the chance.

45:10.240 --> 45:11.040
Like a year.

45:11.040 --> 45:14.320
Now, if you were saying that you were moving away in like a week.

45:14.880 --> 45:16.560
Yeah, that's different.

45:16.560 --> 45:18.160
That's a different kettle of fish.

45:18.160 --> 45:21.600
There's a lot of hurt feelings and stuff that are going to be associated with that.

45:21.600 --> 45:24.800
Yeah, but yeah, she could die.

45:25.600 --> 45:26.560
She could die.

45:26.560 --> 45:27.360
You could die.

45:28.080 --> 45:28.880
You could die.

45:28.880 --> 45:30.000
You could kill each other.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.480
You could kill each other in a gunfight.

45:32.480 --> 45:39.200
Gunfight in like a like one of you tackles the other one off the top of a building and

45:39.200 --> 45:40.960
you're falling together but still fighting.

45:40.960 --> 45:43.040
It's like you're still punching each other as you fall.

45:43.040 --> 45:47.280
And you think like if I can put her body below mine and we fall and hit the ground, then

45:47.280 --> 45:47.680
she'll die.

45:47.680 --> 45:48.960
But I'll be okay liking crank.

45:48.960 --> 45:50.000
But guess what?

45:50.000 --> 45:51.520
Life don't work like crank.

45:51.520 --> 45:53.840
And then she pulls a parachute and you're like bullshit.

45:53.840 --> 45:57.280
I don't have one of those guys married you and I had the chance.

45:57.280 --> 45:58.400
You're very smart.

45:58.400 --> 45:59.040
Cranked again.

45:59.040 --> 46:02.080
Hey, have you guys seen cranked again?

46:02.080 --> 46:06.000
It starts Scott Baio and at the end the school burns down.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.440
It's a pretty weird movie.

46:09.760 --> 46:10.800
What would you be fighting?

46:11.360 --> 46:12.880
I mean, it is we're joking.

46:12.880 --> 46:16.480
It is very realistic that they could be in a gunfight when Quetzalcoatl comes.

46:17.600 --> 46:23.840
Maybe their mom, both their moms have an infection and they both need penicillin.

46:23.840 --> 46:26.320
Of course, Quetzalcoatl drinks penicillin for energy.

46:26.320 --> 46:26.640
Yeah.

46:26.640 --> 46:28.480
So there's not a lot to go around.

46:28.480 --> 46:29.440
Oh, Hunger Games.

46:29.440 --> 46:32.000
There's also a lot we still don't know about Quetzalcoatl.

46:32.000 --> 46:32.480
Yeah, sure.

46:32.480 --> 46:34.560
There's a lot you don't know about Quetzalcoatl.

46:34.560 --> 46:36.960
I know I'm spilling all kinds of facts right now.

46:38.160 --> 46:38.720
It's bird.

46:39.600 --> 46:41.520
It is avian in nature, right?

46:41.520 --> 46:42.560
Am I imagining it?

46:42.560 --> 46:43.680
Isn't it bird snake?

46:43.680 --> 46:44.800
Chicken snake.

46:44.800 --> 46:45.360
Cockatrice.

46:45.360 --> 46:46.480
I can't be bothered to Wikipedia.

46:46.480 --> 46:48.240
I don't know what we're talking about anymore.

46:48.240 --> 46:49.440
I don't know either.

46:49.440 --> 46:51.120
So yeah, go love this girl.

46:51.120 --> 46:53.600
The only thing I know is go love this girl.

46:54.240 --> 46:55.680
That's everybody by the way.

46:55.680 --> 46:56.240
Just pair up.

46:56.240 --> 46:58.960
Yeah, just go ahead and partner off now.

46:58.960 --> 46:59.600
Just partner off.

46:59.600 --> 47:01.440
It'll make it easier to consume.

47:01.440 --> 47:01.680
Stop.

47:03.680 --> 47:05.760
His mouth is only two people wide.

47:05.760 --> 47:10.080
So actually it would be great for him if everybody could pair up before he gets back.

47:10.640 --> 47:12.800
And then maybe if you like, if you each hold hands,

47:12.800 --> 47:17.280
you can like loop around one of his giant fangs and try to hold on as long as you can.

47:17.280 --> 47:22.000
If you are mega fat, hook up with another mega fat, pair up.

47:22.000 --> 47:22.560
He goes to...

47:24.160 --> 47:24.800
Dead.

47:24.800 --> 47:25.360
Choked to death.

47:25.360 --> 47:26.400
Sacrifice yourself.

47:26.400 --> 47:28.960
Thank you for your sacrifice, John Goodman.

47:30.640 --> 47:34.960
If it turns out that the fate of the human race turned on the moment

47:34.960 --> 47:38.480
that Tom Arnold and Roseanne Arnold split up.

47:38.480 --> 47:40.880
That's exactly what I was just thinking of.

47:40.880 --> 47:45.600
Sam, Dr. Sam Beckett goes back and re-inhabits the body of Roseanne Barr.

47:45.600 --> 47:47.680
So Tom Arnold and Roseanne Barr all stay together.

47:47.680 --> 47:48.560
Now Tom.

47:49.200 --> 47:50.320
Oh God damn it.

47:50.320 --> 47:50.800
Oh boy.

47:51.760 --> 47:52.640
I don't know.

47:52.640 --> 47:53.360
I don't know, Sam.

47:53.360 --> 47:57.200
I think you gotta, I think you gotta be eaten by Quetzalcoatl and choked to death.

47:57.200 --> 48:01.280
You gotta first seduce Tom Arnold and then be eaten by Quetzalcoatl.

48:01.280 --> 48:02.560
I don't know which one is worse.

48:03.840 --> 48:05.920
Oh Ziggy, no thanks.

48:05.920 --> 48:07.280
Quantum Leap was a good show.

48:07.280 --> 48:07.760
It was.

48:07.760 --> 48:10.160
There's a lot of possibilities they didn't explore though.

48:10.160 --> 48:14.080
I just, so my girlfriend and I just moved in together and we were going through a CD.

48:14.080 --> 48:16.480
She has the soundtrack to Quantum Leap.

48:16.480 --> 48:17.120
What?

48:17.120 --> 48:19.040
She has the soundtrack to Quantum Leap.

48:19.040 --> 48:19.520
The Quantum Leap soundtrack.

48:19.520 --> 48:20.320
What's it sound like?

48:20.320 --> 48:21.760
Can you give me, can you break me off a beat?

48:21.760 --> 48:23.680
Yeah sure, tracks one through 19 are like.

48:28.800 --> 48:30.080
And there's like a jazz cover.

48:31.280 --> 48:32.240
You guys wanna Yahoo?

48:32.240 --> 48:34.800
And then there's a, there's a spoken word one.

48:35.680 --> 48:39.920
Can I tell you guys something true about Quantum Leap?

48:39.920 --> 48:40.160
Yes.

48:40.960 --> 48:45.840
I read when I was in middle school, I was so way into Quantum Leap

48:45.840 --> 48:49.040
that I read a novelization.

48:49.040 --> 48:50.080
Holy shit.

48:50.080 --> 48:55.080
based on like an unfilmed episode of Quantum Leap.

48:55.600 --> 48:58.080
And in this novelization,

48:59.720 --> 49:02.320
Dr. Sam Beckett leapt into the body

49:02.320 --> 49:07.320
of a carnival worker with Down syndrome.

49:07.440 --> 49:09.880
Oh, yeah.

49:09.880 --> 49:10.720
Yeah.

49:10.720 --> 49:13.260
And it was never produced, you say.

49:13.260 --> 49:16.280
Yeah, I mean, there are like side stories basically

49:16.280 --> 49:19.320
is the best way I can explain it to you.

49:19.320 --> 49:22.480
But yes, yes.

49:22.480 --> 49:23.320
That is what happened.

49:23.320 --> 49:26.560
And did you buy this at a Scholastic school book fair?

49:26.560 --> 49:28.780
If you're at a Scholastic school book fair,

49:28.780 --> 49:33.260
then you will have no problem tracking this one down.

49:33.260 --> 49:35.920
It's pretty fantastic.

49:35.920 --> 49:39.800
He has to pretend to have Down syndrome.

49:39.800 --> 49:40.920
Oh my God.

49:40.920 --> 49:42.640
I know, it deals with a lot of questions

49:42.640 --> 49:45.460
that the episodes never had the courage.

49:45.460 --> 49:48.760
Like what would it be like to be just super offended?

49:48.760 --> 49:50.560
Yeah, like what would it be like

49:50.560 --> 49:52.960
to read the most offensive novel ever written?

49:54.880 --> 49:55.720
Griffin.

49:55.720 --> 49:57.680
This yahoo was sent in by Krista Whelan.

49:57.680 --> 49:59.120
Thank you, Krista.

49:59.120 --> 50:01.840
It's the douchiest, just get ready.

50:01.840 --> 50:05.640
It's by yahoo answers user fifth Earl of Davishire

50:05.640 --> 50:08.940
or perhaps Dave Shire, who asks,

50:10.560 --> 50:12.600
I'm not, I'm not, okay.

50:12.600 --> 50:15.660
May it, I have to do like a voice.

50:15.660 --> 50:18.400
May a gentleman kick a door off its hinges

50:18.400 --> 50:20.200
in an emergency.

50:20.200 --> 50:21.720
I'm not usually the sort of fellow

50:21.720 --> 50:23.700
to go around kicking doors off hinges,

50:23.700 --> 50:26.640
but for reasons too wearisome to detail,

50:26.640 --> 50:28.520
there is presently a locked door

50:28.520 --> 50:31.000
between myself and a crate of gin.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.280
Obviously myself and the gin need to become

50:33.280 --> 50:34.800
better acquainted.

50:34.800 --> 50:37.960
Is there an etiquette to kicking doors to matchwood?

50:37.960 --> 50:39.480
The door in question is the house

50:39.480 --> 50:42.080
of a particularly tiresome aunt of mine.

50:44.080 --> 50:46.800
This is the happiest I've ever been.

50:46.800 --> 50:48.680
Oh my God.

50:48.680 --> 50:50.200
I am not kidding you guys.

50:50.200 --> 50:54.120
There is probably 20 responses,

50:54.120 --> 50:57.640
each of which are done in the style

50:57.640 --> 51:00.800
of like a Downton Abbey role play.

51:02.840 --> 51:06.960
Who taught anthropomorphized owls how to use the internet?

51:06.960 --> 51:08.360
That's what I want to know.

51:10.120 --> 51:11.800
Can we not?

51:11.800 --> 51:12.760
Kick indoors?

51:12.760 --> 51:14.640
I don't think the bobbies would approve

51:14.640 --> 51:16.840
and I know your aunt wouldn't.

51:16.840 --> 51:18.320
Fuck you, stop it.

51:18.320 --> 51:20.240
Breaking and entering plus theft

51:20.240 --> 51:23.620
is good for about five years in the gaol.

51:23.620 --> 51:26.680
If auntie were to suffer a stroke during the misdeed,

51:26.680 --> 51:28.920
then they'd probably permanently confine you

51:28.920 --> 51:30.720
in the Tower of London.

51:30.720 --> 51:35.440
Like, listen to these London things I know.

51:35.440 --> 51:36.960
Certainly not.

51:36.960 --> 51:39.280
One has people to carry out such tasks

51:39.280 --> 51:41.360
as the hero song goes.

51:41.360 --> 51:44.280
Lord Derby tried to mend the electric light.

51:44.280 --> 51:47.800
The current shock struck him dead and serve him right.

51:47.800 --> 51:49.560
It is the duty of the wealthy man

51:49.560 --> 51:51.760
to grant employment to the artisan.

51:53.360 --> 51:56.360
Now listen, are we going to deal with the issue

51:56.360 --> 51:58.640
of this being the douchiest thing I've ever heard

51:58.640 --> 52:00.680
or are we going to talk about kicking indoors?

52:00.680 --> 52:03.080
Listen, we will get to kicking indoors.

52:03.080 --> 52:06.260
I want to know what sort of splinter

52:06.260 --> 52:08.320
Yahoo Answers these people are using.

52:08.320 --> 52:09.860
Steampunk Yahoo.

52:09.860 --> 52:12.560
That everyone else who uses Yahoo Answers

52:12.560 --> 52:15.440
hasn't stumbled in and just been baffled

52:15.440 --> 52:16.400
by what's going on.

52:16.400 --> 52:19.280
Hey yo, are we gonna kick down doors or what?

52:19.280 --> 52:20.720
Fuck.

52:20.720 --> 52:21.780
Yahoo Answers.

52:23.040 --> 52:26.080
Listen, can we get back to talking about

52:26.080 --> 52:28.000
my fucking stepdad or what?

52:28.000 --> 52:28.840
Shit.

52:28.840 --> 52:30.200
Listen, I broke my butt cheeks.

52:30.200 --> 52:32.400
Let's focus up, people.

52:32.400 --> 52:34.360
Jesus, what is this bullshit?

52:34.360 --> 52:37.200
Listen, I was trying to leave poop in some bitch.

52:37.200 --> 52:38.040
Yahoo.

52:40.280 --> 52:41.720
What are you even saying?

52:41.720 --> 52:44.000
I'm trying to figure out how to superman a hoe.

52:44.000 --> 52:44.840
Can we please focus?

52:44.840 --> 52:47.340
Hey, I cut myself for a mermaid spell.

52:47.340 --> 52:48.180
Yahoo.

52:52.800 --> 52:54.940
It would usually be considered a poor show

52:54.940 --> 52:56.820
to kick a door in yourself, old boy,

52:56.820 --> 52:59.120
but drastic times call for drastic measures.

52:59.120 --> 53:02.040
That gin won't drink itself after all.

53:02.040 --> 53:05.160
The very next guy, I fucked a tree to summon aliens.

53:05.160 --> 53:10.160
Oh.

53:10.840 --> 53:14.840
Oh, old chap, that sounds like quite a splintery situation

53:14.840 --> 53:15.880
for your tallywacker.

53:15.880 --> 53:17.840
Like, what the fuck are you talking about?

53:17.840 --> 53:18.680
Oh God.

53:21.860 --> 53:24.940
Tip top, someone said.

53:24.940 --> 53:25.820
Just that?

53:25.820 --> 53:27.340
What's the opposite of that?

53:27.340 --> 53:28.300
Cause that's what this is.

53:28.300 --> 53:29.400
Bottom, bottom.

53:29.400 --> 53:30.640
Bottom, bottom.

53:30.640 --> 53:31.480
Yeah.

53:31.480 --> 53:33.520
Can we, on the subject of crazy Yahoo Answers,

53:33.520 --> 53:36.000
can we, I mean, this is the closer, right?

53:36.000 --> 53:37.720
Are we in the closer?

53:37.720 --> 53:39.440
Yes, this is the, we're living in the closer.

53:39.440 --> 53:40.780
All right, we're gonna do all our thank yous,

53:40.780 --> 53:42.440
but I feel like Travis and I,

53:42.440 --> 53:45.080
I feel like every, I don't know, 50 episodes or so,

53:45.080 --> 53:47.680
we need to give a plea to our listeners

53:47.680 --> 53:48.580
and question submitters,

53:48.580 --> 53:50.920
because seriously, we love you guys so much,

53:50.920 --> 53:54.160
and like, we couldn't do this without your help,

53:54.160 --> 53:57.200
but some of the questions and some of the Yahoos

53:57.200 --> 54:02.080
have gotten a little rankerous, I think is good.

54:02.080 --> 54:04.080
Let's just run down a list of the things

54:04.080 --> 54:05.840
that we won't, for lack of a better word, touch.

54:05.840 --> 54:09.960
Okay, if you talk about having sex with sleeping people,

54:09.960 --> 54:11.600
like fucking stop it.

54:11.600 --> 54:14.420
Like don't, if you submit something,

54:14.420 --> 54:15.620
either Yahoo or a question,

54:15.620 --> 54:16.560
and you look at it and go,

54:16.560 --> 54:18.240
oh, this is pretty fucking gross,

54:18.240 --> 54:20.640
we're probably not going to read it.

54:20.640 --> 54:22.720
Like that includes poop.

54:22.720 --> 54:27.720
It includes masturbating your amputee son.

54:28.040 --> 54:30.440
Yeah, that's a real thing someone sent in.

54:30.440 --> 54:34.320
That's awful, like don't send in gross, awful things anymore.

54:34.320 --> 54:35.880
Like, thank you for the funny stuff,

54:35.880 --> 54:38.120
and like, we appreciate it so much,

54:38.120 --> 54:40.720
but just like, we're not going to read it,

54:40.720 --> 54:42.120
and it's psychically upsetting

54:42.120 --> 54:44.200
when you send us something that is-

54:44.200 --> 54:46.120
And it's a completely different vein,

54:46.120 --> 54:49.080
but please stop asking me questions about Diablo 3.

54:49.080 --> 54:49.920
Yeah.

54:49.920 --> 54:53.200
It's not the same as masturbating your poop,

54:53.200 --> 54:57.080
but Diablo 3 questions, we're covered.

54:57.080 --> 55:02.080
I'll drop my battle tag up in here if you guys,

55:03.600 --> 55:04.760
if you want to meet up.

55:06.480 --> 55:08.280
You know, so just focus up,

55:08.280 --> 55:10.080
and get your question game right.

55:10.080 --> 55:11.700
Yeah, just get it together maybe, just a little bit.

55:11.700 --> 55:13.240
Like think about it before you submit,

55:13.240 --> 55:16.000
think before you submit, and get it right.

55:16.000 --> 55:16.840
Thank you so much.

55:16.840 --> 55:19.040
And if you got a query,

55:19.040 --> 55:21.000
it doesn't have to be anything big.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.040
Sometimes you just need an argument settled,

55:23.040 --> 55:23.880
we're there for you.

55:23.880 --> 55:25.880
Also- You need something every day.

55:25.880 --> 55:27.920
If you could email,

55:27.920 --> 55:29.480
we've probably haven't given out an email in a while.

55:29.480 --> 55:31.320
It's mbnbam at gmail.com.

55:31.320 --> 55:33.040
Send your questions, and your Yahoo's there.

55:33.040 --> 55:34.880
I really appreciate all the ones people send to Twitter,

55:34.880 --> 55:38.120
but it's so hard to like look through that.

55:38.120 --> 55:40.200
We have like a catch-all for Yahoo answers

55:40.200 --> 55:41.260
that come in the email.

55:41.260 --> 55:44.200
So if you email them, that's stupendous.

55:44.200 --> 55:45.020
Thank you so much.

55:45.020 --> 55:48.320
mbnbam at maximumfun.org works the same,

55:48.320 --> 55:49.160
goes to the same place.

55:49.160 --> 55:50.160
Yeah.

55:50.160 --> 55:51.960
Maybe feels a little more official.

55:51.960 --> 55:53.700
So that's- If you like it, a fish.

55:53.700 --> 55:54.540
That's my plea.

55:54.540 --> 55:55.360
Thank you guys.

55:55.360 --> 55:56.200
Everybody, thank you.

55:56.200 --> 55:58.440
I'm honored every day.

55:59.600 --> 56:02.480
Every day is a winding road.

56:02.480 --> 56:03.720
Your bodies are wonderlands.

56:03.720 --> 56:05.520
Thank you, for all your bodies.

56:05.520 --> 56:06.520
Thank you.

56:06.520 --> 56:07.880
Thank you for your bodies.

56:09.840 --> 56:11.520
Hey, I appreciate all the bodies.

56:11.520 --> 56:12.920
I just wanted to get on that bandwagon,

56:12.920 --> 56:13.760
and everybody else was talking about bodies,

56:13.760 --> 56:15.260
and I didn't. Come on.

56:15.260 --> 56:16.100
Come on.

56:16.100 --> 56:19.520
Let me hop on that body bandwagon.

56:19.520 --> 56:22.400
Thanks to everybody who tweeted about the show this week.

56:22.400 --> 56:24.320
I'm not gonna do what I normally do to start at the top.

56:24.320 --> 56:25.720
I'm gonna go backwards.

56:25.720 --> 56:26.760
Okay.

56:26.760 --> 56:31.280
Thanks to Tyler Woodburn, plainzombie,

56:33.240 --> 56:34.280
mecan'ttweet.

56:34.280 --> 56:35.520
That's a pretty good one.

56:35.520 --> 56:38.960
Alicia dances, spaceman spiff, iggy k,

56:38.960 --> 56:41.720
IDF-inners, ID-finners?

56:41.720 --> 56:42.760
It's hard to say.

56:42.760 --> 56:46.240
Spell it right, loser names, Emma Heike.

56:46.240 --> 56:47.980
I almost certainly fucked that up.

56:47.980 --> 56:52.980
Brian from WI, presumably Wisconsin.

56:52.980 --> 56:54.300
Or from WII.

56:54.300 --> 56:56.660
Or from WII, little froggies.

56:56.660 --> 57:00.020
Admiral Christy, Jamie is a twit, thingsbydan.

57:00.020 --> 57:04.180
Thank you to everybody tweeting about the show.

57:04.180 --> 57:06.620
It means a lot to us,

57:06.620 --> 57:09.820
and so thanks.

57:09.820 --> 57:12.620
Just so you guys know, we've got coming up Max Fun Con.

57:12.620 --> 57:13.820
Coming up in just a couple weeks.

57:13.820 --> 57:15.100
We're gonna be doing a live show there,

57:15.100 --> 57:17.620
so if you're going to be at Max Fun Con,

57:17.620 --> 57:19.860
and you would like us to answer a question

57:19.860 --> 57:21.380
at our live show there,

57:21.380 --> 57:23.340
then make sure that you email us that question,

57:23.340 --> 57:24.940
and make sure that you put in the subject line

57:24.940 --> 57:27.060
that it is a question for Max Fun Con,

57:27.060 --> 57:29.500
so that we can answer it for you live.

57:29.500 --> 57:30.580
Please make it good.

57:30.580 --> 57:32.180
There's gonna be so many people there

57:32.180 --> 57:33.020
that are gonna be intimidated.

57:33.020 --> 57:36.500
People that have never heard the show before, possibly.

57:36.500 --> 57:37.900
Oh, I can't think about it.

57:37.900 --> 57:41.060
Like, I'm pants-shittingly terrified of this show.

57:41.060 --> 57:43.100
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

57:43.100 --> 57:44.140
for the use of our theme song,

57:44.140 --> 57:46.540
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

57:46.540 --> 57:49.660
It's a fantastic, fantastic album,

57:49.660 --> 57:52.420
which everyone should own.

57:52.420 --> 57:55.180
Don't Spotify it, okay?

57:55.180 --> 57:56.660
Because then, if your internet goes out,

57:56.660 --> 57:58.940
you can't listen to it, you creep.

57:58.940 --> 58:00.340
Purchase it, physically.

58:02.500 --> 58:05.660
And make sure you go check out TheEmps.org,

58:05.660 --> 58:08.620
WednesdayWolf.com, MobRulesGames.com,

58:08.620 --> 58:12.300
and IndieGoGo.com slash Wrong Way.

58:12.300 --> 58:13.820
And go give a listen to all the other

58:13.820 --> 58:16.980
great Max Fun Fun shows, Throwing Shade,

58:16.980 --> 58:20.580
Jordan Jesse Goh, JaJuan Hodgman, stop podcasting yourself.

58:20.580 --> 58:22.820
They're all just delightful.

58:22.820 --> 58:23.660
The end.

58:23.660 --> 58:24.500
The end of the show.

58:24.500 --> 58:25.540
The end, the end of our show.

58:25.540 --> 58:28.940
This final Yahoo was sent in by Lisa Holofield.

58:28.940 --> 58:29.780
Thank you, Lisa.

58:29.780 --> 58:32.940
It's by Yahoo Answers user Annoying, who asks,

58:34.740 --> 58:38.740
who was your favorite Beatle from the band The Beatles?

58:38.740 --> 58:49.540
I'm Justin McElroy, I'm Travis McElroy, I'm Griffin McElroy, this has been my brother, my brother and me, kiss your dads flair on the lips.
