00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:51.520
Hello, everyone, and welcome to what is sure to be maybe the last episode of 2018 or the

00:51.520 --> 00:58.480
first episode of 2019. Time shall tell. It's always hard to tell when editing will occur.

00:58.480 --> 01:04.480
Yeah, but welcome to my brother, my brother, me and advice show for this, the most modern

01:04.480 --> 01:10.000
era we've yet encountered. My name is Justin McElroy. I'm your brother. Well, see, I was

01:10.000 --> 01:13.120
gonna say I was the oldest brother because you'd missed your chance. Okay, I'm your

01:13.120 --> 01:18.880
middlest brother, Travis McElroy. What a fucking sloppy intro. What a sloppy, nasty. I know the

01:18.880 --> 01:26.720
holidays got us tired. Organic. It's not organic. It's sloppy and rotten. We made it ourselves with

01:26.720 --> 01:35.520
our own two hands. And I'm Griffin McElroy. The baby knew you. This is great. Oh, there's my dogs.

01:35.520 --> 01:40.320
Oh my god, it's the worst intro we've ever done. Justin, quick, drop some spaghetti on the

01:40.320 --> 01:43.840
microphone or something. Drop some spaghetti on the keyboard and spend the next 15 minutes

01:43.840 --> 01:50.800
cleaning it up. I'm gonna talk about the coffee I'm drinking in long-winded and uninteresting terms.

01:50.800 --> 01:55.200
So Justin, get to work on the spaghetti. Travis, get your dog stuff going. I'll take it from here.

01:55.200 --> 02:01.200
No, I'm keeping those dogs quiet now. Give them treats. All right. This is gonna be a weird one,

02:01.200 --> 02:07.920
huh? Because it always is around this year in times. It's either a celebration of like,

02:07.920 --> 02:13.360
it's like a wake. You know, the year is dying. Or it's like a birthday party for a new year.

02:15.280 --> 02:19.360
Pretzel flips? What is happening? No, that's the treats for my good, good puppies.

02:19.360 --> 02:24.960
All right, this is gonna be a wild one. This is like almost an editing challenge.

02:24.960 --> 02:28.720
We should send this one out to like all the editors of all the top podcasts and see who

02:28.720 --> 02:38.080
can make the most listenable thing. Fix this one, Gimlet. Yeah, come on, Gimlet. So what's it all

02:38.080 --> 02:42.560
about? 2019, a lot of people are asking about. And I think it's time that we fucking solve it.

02:42.560 --> 02:46.720
Do we want to solve that up top? Is that probably the best? I think it's gonna take us a half hour.

02:46.720 --> 02:52.160
Traditionally, it takes us about a half hour. I have about 10 ideas. So there's some housekeeping

02:52.160 --> 02:56.080
to get out of the way before we get into the discussion proper. First, I would just like to

02:56.080 --> 03:04.000
start by reviewing our themes throughout the years. A quick tour through history.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.080
Yeah. And how well we've accomplished them. Yeah, that's the part I'm worried about.

03:08.080 --> 03:13.600
I'm not gonna remember that for all these. But okay, so 2010, Zolo. Not much of a theme.

03:13.600 --> 03:18.800
We were in our infancy there. At the same time, maybe our best theme.

03:18.800 --> 03:24.400
A very good theme, we can all agree, but it was Zolo in 2010 because it looked like the word Zolo.

03:24.400 --> 03:29.920
Yeah, sure. And then someone stole that and made a wedding registry website out of it.

03:29.920 --> 03:33.920
Yeah, it's no good. 2000 in Heaven. That was 2011.

03:33.920 --> 03:38.480
Let's get right with Christ. Yeah, right with Christ. That was our evangelical year.

03:40.160 --> 03:45.440
Then we had getting it in 20 does. Oh, yeah. 20 does.

03:45.440 --> 03:52.320
20 does. That is so broad and its broadness can be deeply problematic, I feel like.

03:52.320 --> 03:56.880
Yeah, I mean, yeah. A lot of our early stuff was very problematic.

03:56.880 --> 03:59.600
Sure, sure, sure. This one was,

03:59.600 --> 04:02.800
I liked this one, 2013, dig it up and get it out.

04:03.600 --> 04:08.400
Yeah, that one I actually like a lot. That was kind of when we introduced subtitles

04:08.400 --> 04:14.560
because we started needing them. So 2013, dig it up, get it out. After that, we had 20 forward

04:14.560 --> 04:20.800
from episode 181, Boy Car, 20 forward. Can I ask you guys a question?

04:20.800 --> 04:27.680
Yeah. Do you remember 2014? I don't remember 2014 at all. I don't remember the whole year 2014.

04:27.680 --> 04:33.360
When people mention it, I feel like I just skipped that one. I don't remember 2014 at all.

04:33.360 --> 04:38.720
I blend every year before 2016 in a large miasma in a pot called good.

04:38.720 --> 04:42.800
Yeah. And then it was just kind of other. It's like good and other.

04:42.800 --> 04:49.600
It is when my daughter was born. So my first child was born in 2014. So I do remember that.

04:49.600 --> 04:53.200
I remember 2015. 2015 was 20 grift team.

04:53.200 --> 04:53.440
Yes.

04:53.440 --> 04:55.440
20 grift team, the con is on.

04:56.560 --> 04:59.440
Yeah. And that's when I did steal Declaration of Independence.

04:59.440 --> 04:59.680
Yeah.

05:00.720 --> 05:03.120
2016, building bridges.

05:03.120 --> 05:06.320
Probably the first one to say just didn't build much bridge.

05:06.320 --> 05:06.560
No.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.320
Probably our biggest win.

05:10.320 --> 05:16.320
Well, the problem was is that year I took it too literally and I did build that one bridge

05:16.880 --> 05:18.960
out of wood and stone.

05:18.960 --> 05:19.200
Yeah.

05:20.240 --> 05:24.640
Yeah. It was more like a bridge to Terabithia where we all kind of fell right off it and did

05:24.640 --> 05:27.440
die in the creek. Boy, it was some foresight.

05:27.440 --> 05:28.880
Is that what that book's about?

05:28.880 --> 05:34.000
Yeah. It would have been good if we had had a little foresight and been like 2016.

05:34.880 --> 05:35.680
Whoops.

05:35.680 --> 05:38.400
Oh, here it goes. Hold on.

05:38.400 --> 05:44.880
Here's 20 serpentine, keep them guessing. That was a powerful theme, I thought.

05:44.880 --> 05:45.040
Yes.

05:45.040 --> 05:53.280
And I feel like a lot of people did zag on them. We zagged on television by kicking off our show

05:53.280 --> 05:56.080
and then television zagged on us.

05:56.080 --> 05:56.560
Us.

05:56.560 --> 06:04.080
Yeah. Zagged their zag nuts right on our fucking foreheads. Sure, yeah.

06:04.080 --> 06:08.640
And then we had collaborate teen stronger together, a powerful year.

06:09.440 --> 06:14.160
Now, how do you think you've done as far as collaborating goes?

06:15.600 --> 06:22.720
Some good collaboration. I mean, for us personally, we released our graphic novel.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.720
We collaborated with our daddy, yeah.

06:24.720 --> 06:29.280
Collaborate. Well, we collaborated with Carrie Peach and the fine folks that are our publisher.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.360
We collaborated on the Mysterious Package Company thing. That was a collaboration.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.080
That was cool.

06:34.080 --> 06:35.120
We fulfilled that.

06:35.120 --> 06:35.840
Yeah, we did it.

06:35.840 --> 06:38.640
That was good. We did some collaborating, collaborated on some

06:39.280 --> 06:42.400
shirts and merch and posters. We did lots of collaborations.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.160
Hey, I made the new track with Shaggy.

06:44.880 --> 06:46.880
Yes, it was in fact me.

06:47.520 --> 06:51.280
Yeah, after years of growth and reflection, I can admit it was me.

06:52.800 --> 06:56.320
Now, Travis, you had an idea that maybe we should get out of the way first about

06:56.880 --> 06:59.920
how bad it was and then we'll get on with the show.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.880
Well, now that you've had some time to marinate on it.

07:02.880 --> 07:03.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:03.360 --> 07:06.560
20 equine teen, this year we buy a horse.

07:08.080 --> 07:11.680
It's buying that I don't like, Trav. If I could just ride-

07:11.680 --> 07:11.920
Steel?

07:12.560 --> 07:16.720
Steel. I mean, if you go out into the- I live in Texas, baby.

07:17.280 --> 07:21.920
The Lone Star State, deep in the heart of it, and I feel like there's probably some fucking horses

07:21.920 --> 07:27.920
here out in a field that nobody owns except God, even though you can't really technically own a

07:27.920 --> 07:32.400
horse. I could possess one that is wild and we could become best friends.

07:32.400 --> 07:38.080
I'm happy to change it to this year we acquire through some sort of means a horse.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.760
It's gotta be. It's way too long.

07:39.760 --> 07:44.480
It's so long. It's so long. So we've ruled that one out pretty definitively.

07:44.480 --> 07:49.200
The other problem is horse jokes are oh so over. So, so over.

07:49.200 --> 07:49.680
Wow.

07:49.680 --> 07:55.680
So over. Yeah. Next year, all the jokes are about vegetables and how yucky they are.

07:55.680 --> 08:02.320
Oh. That's a preview for 2019 is how gross vegetables are. So enjoy those.

08:02.320 --> 08:08.320
I would, I also, I think I previously mentioned 20 vaccine, which I still enjoy very much.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.560
I could go for any year.

08:10.560 --> 08:15.120
Yeah, it could go for any year. So I think that we could roll that one out.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.000
So maybe that's just like a rolling one forever.

08:18.640 --> 08:23.360
Well, except for next, the year after 2020, it can't be done anymore. But yes,

08:23.360 --> 08:25.680
I'm going to start throwing some of mine out because I got.

08:25.680 --> 08:28.640
Hold on. I got a Google document. I got to open a Google document.

08:28.640 --> 08:29.040
Okay, please.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.880
Because we're business professionals now.

08:30.880 --> 08:31.360
Yes.

08:31.360 --> 08:36.240
I actually, I have an amazing one that was picked to me by Teresa,

08:36.240 --> 08:40.160
but I actually, I've learned from my mistakes. I'm going to wait.

08:40.160 --> 08:41.840
Yeah, you have to make yours go last.

08:41.840 --> 08:43.520
We never pick the first one.

08:43.520 --> 08:44.480
No, no, we never do.

08:44.480 --> 08:48.080
No, we got to burn through some chaff to get to my wheat.

08:48.080 --> 08:51.360
Let me just put in, as long as that's how we're thinking about this,

08:51.360 --> 08:53.760
let me put out this early contender, that's not going to make it,

08:53.760 --> 08:56.880
but 20 vine teen, a six second celebration.

08:56.880 --> 09:00.480
And this is sort of just getting psyched about it coming back as V2.

09:00.480 --> 09:01.280
Nice.

09:01.280 --> 09:03.520
Now that's officially not happening.

09:03.520 --> 09:06.880
No, there is going to be a vine successor. They are making a vine successor next year.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.760
They came out and said, like, okay, yes, we are going to do it.

09:09.760 --> 09:12.720
And then they came out after that and said, no, we're not.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.160
They didn't cancel it a second time.

09:15.360 --> 09:18.000
Who do you think you're talking to?

09:18.000 --> 09:20.560
Do you really think you know more about Vine than me?

09:20.560 --> 09:23.200
Griffin has Google Alerts set up.

09:23.200 --> 09:23.760
Yeah, dog.

09:23.760 --> 09:28.240
There will be no Vine 2. It's called Byte, B-Y-T-E, and that doesn't work.

09:28.240 --> 09:30.960
That doesn't rhyme. Yeah, it's done. Get out of here, 20 vine teen.

09:30.960 --> 09:33.120
Okay, I'm sure there's Google Alerts.

09:33.120 --> 09:36.240
God, this is not going to be funny, but it is going to be necessary.

09:36.240 --> 09:41.360
What about 20 sign teen? What's AsaBase up to?

09:41.360 --> 09:45.520
Yeah, see, I had 20 signs teen revisiting a Shyamalan classic.

09:45.520 --> 09:46.320
Oh.

09:46.320 --> 09:52.080
And it could be about, like, you know, the sort of message of signs, which is, um, God-

09:52.080 --> 09:52.880
Water bad.

09:53.600 --> 09:59.120
Well, God makes things happen that help you fight the aliens.

09:59.120 --> 10:02.800
God hates aliens.

10:02.800 --> 10:04.640
God hates aliens because he didn't make them,

10:04.640 --> 10:08.080
so he makes things happen that helps you fight them, which is good.

10:09.360 --> 10:12.400
I like how, can we spoil signs for a second?

10:12.400 --> 10:12.880
Yeah.

10:12.880 --> 10:20.160
I like how God had to kill Mel Gibson's wife so she could instruct Joaquin Phoenix to hit

10:20.160 --> 10:21.520
the glass with the bat.

10:21.520 --> 10:26.240
He would have just stood there holding the bat thinking, well, what now?

10:26.240 --> 10:29.920
Okay, here's mine. My current, my favorite currently.

10:29.920 --> 10:30.420
Okay.

10:33.040 --> 10:36.080
20 brine teen. The sea is calling.

10:36.080 --> 10:41.120
Hmm. This is good. I tell you, I like that one.

10:41.120 --> 10:46.400
I'm very afraid of the ocean and everything in it, and above it, and on top of it, and

10:46.400 --> 10:48.320
the big waves that it makes.

10:48.320 --> 10:53.600
But I do, I do kind of like that though, Griffin, because the sea is calling could both be like,

10:53.600 --> 10:59.040
you know, come to me, join me here, but it could also be like in Scream when the killer

10:59.040 --> 11:02.080
is calling, like the sea is calling from inside your house.

11:02.080 --> 11:08.480
That's fun. We've never done one that's like an explicit threat from, like, a body of water.

11:08.480 --> 11:09.040
Yeah.

11:09.040 --> 11:12.560
That could be good, Justin.

11:12.560 --> 11:16.880
Now here's alternate subtitle that really changes it.

11:18.880 --> 11:21.280
20 brine teen. Make meat a treat.

11:21.920 --> 11:27.680
There's a lot of different preparations of meat that would be improved if you brine them

11:27.680 --> 11:30.560
first. You're going to lock in a lot of moisture and a lot of flavor.

11:30.560 --> 11:34.640
If you're not brining your turkey or chicken, even beef, I think that you're really missing

11:34.640 --> 11:36.080
out on some big bowl flavors.

11:36.080 --> 11:40.320
And this is really going to go great with my making fun of vegetables sort of ideas.

11:41.440 --> 11:44.080
Can I pitch a subtitle for 20 brine teen?

11:44.080 --> 11:44.720
Yeah.

11:44.720 --> 11:47.040
20 brine teen. Are you going to eat your pickle?

11:47.040 --> 11:50.480
Hmm. Are you? Hey, you're going to eat that pickle?

11:50.480 --> 11:51.040
Yeah.

11:51.040 --> 11:57.120
Yeah. Listen, it's a specific year. We've shot big before and failed. We tried with building

11:57.120 --> 12:00.960
bridges. We didn't do it. This time, this is all about like, you know what?

12:00.960 --> 12:02.000
Attainable goals.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.920
You're looking at the pickle. I'm not going to eat it. I wish you would just ask.

12:05.920 --> 12:10.720
Sure. Eight straight years of not fulfilling the goals we set before you must be sort of

12:10.720 --> 12:14.560
soul crushing. Let's give you a slow ball.

12:14.560 --> 12:15.600
An attainable one.

12:15.600 --> 12:19.600
An attainable one. I got one here. 20 spine teen. Check your posture.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.880
That could be good. Right now, I'm sitting in a chair. I've got both legs sort of up

12:26.880 --> 12:31.520
in the seat. One is sort of folded upwards and my elbow is resting against it. I look

12:31.520 --> 12:37.040
like a, you know, I'm about to be a cool book reader in front of a fireplace or something

12:37.040 --> 12:40.080
like that, but my posture is absolute dookie right now.

12:40.080 --> 12:45.040
I always sit like that crisscross applesauce when I'm in my office chair and I can't imagine

12:45.040 --> 12:45.680
that's good for me.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.680
Oh man, I'm doing that too.

12:47.680 --> 12:52.160
Yeah. It's almost like I'm playing the floor is lava every time I sit down to record or

12:52.160 --> 12:54.320
edit, so that's not great.

12:54.320 --> 12:55.600
I don't think it's good.

12:55.600 --> 12:56.480
I have one here.

12:56.480 --> 13:04.480
Wait, hold on. Before we move on, posture is important. You guys ever walk around? I

13:04.480 --> 13:08.480
had this thing. I was walking around and I was at Charlie's school a few weeks back and

13:08.480 --> 13:12.800
I was like, my posture is terrible. And I stood up straight and walked around and when

13:12.800 --> 13:19.520
I did that, I instantly felt like some sort of elegant king. And I was like, I'm going

13:19.520 --> 13:25.280
to do this all the time from here on out. And then I did it. But maybe if I had like

13:25.280 --> 13:30.240
an extensive line of merchandise to reinforce it, then I might, you know, it might be a

13:30.240 --> 13:31.040
little easier for me.

13:32.400 --> 13:38.560
So what I've got here written down in my notebook that I have labeled very good ideas.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.240
I have Kevin Klein teen.

13:44.960 --> 13:49.760
Yeah, yeah, well, but Dave was a fucking banger, dude.

13:49.760 --> 13:52.720
Yeah, dude, Dave fucking bangs, bro.

13:52.720 --> 13:58.240
And there's no, I have a second one here, comma, Chris Klein teen.

13:58.240 --> 14:03.120
Okay. Well, I like the first one better because in and out dude fucking bangs.

14:03.120 --> 14:05.920
In and out was good.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.400
Wild Wild West does bang.

14:08.400 --> 14:12.320
Hey guys, Fish Called Wanda, more like a Fish Called Good movie.

14:12.320 --> 14:12.640
Yeah.

14:12.640 --> 14:13.200
Yup.

14:13.200 --> 14:13.440
Yeah.

14:15.280 --> 14:16.720
I'm not writing that one down.

14:16.720 --> 14:16.800
No.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.640
You're not going to write down Kevin Klein teen?

14:18.640 --> 14:23.840
How about this? 20 wine teen, better with age.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.480
And this doesn't have to be about wine.

14:26.480 --> 14:31.200
It could just be like, you are the wine and don't worry about getting older.

14:31.760 --> 14:33.360
But see, you know what is the problem?

14:33.360 --> 14:35.840
There's some shitty older people out there.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.640
Yeah, they didn't get any better.

14:38.640 --> 14:40.320
Unless they started out very bad.

14:40.320 --> 14:40.560
Yeah.

14:40.560 --> 14:46.720
Ooh. Now what if we made it like wine, W-H-I-N-E and it's like 20 wine teen,

14:46.720 --> 14:48.560
and complain about it.

14:48.560 --> 14:50.080
Yeah, that's good.

14:50.080 --> 14:51.040
My food's cold.

14:52.640 --> 14:57.120
I have a quartet here of suggestions that don't have 20 in them,

14:57.120 --> 14:58.400
which I don't even know if we would consider.

14:58.400 --> 14:58.720
You know what?

14:58.720 --> 15:01.360
Collaborate teen didn't have 20 in it, so that's probably okay.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.840
I got dollar sign teen, get the money.

15:03.840 --> 15:04.160
Okay.

15:04.880 --> 15:07.280
I got Frankenstein teen, befriend a monster.

15:07.280 --> 15:09.360
I don't actually like the message of that one.

15:09.360 --> 15:09.920
Yeah.

15:09.920 --> 15:10.400
Okay.

15:10.400 --> 15:14.800
But it could be Frankenstein teen, use what you got, use what you got.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.240
Mm-hmm.

15:16.240 --> 15:17.600
I want to hit you guys with one.

15:17.600 --> 15:17.840
Okay.

15:19.840 --> 15:22.720
20 mine teen, there's gold in them hills.

15:23.440 --> 15:23.760
Wow.

15:25.040 --> 15:29.760
Now what is the sub, is it a literal golden hills?

15:29.760 --> 15:30.160
No, I think all the-

15:30.160 --> 15:31.520
What is it referencing?

15:31.520 --> 15:34.240
If I understand that correctly, all the gold's gone.

15:34.240 --> 15:35.360
We got it all.

15:35.360 --> 15:35.600
Yeah.

15:35.600 --> 15:40.480
But the metaphorical gold in your own personal hills, I think yet remains.

15:41.120 --> 15:41.760
Interesting.

15:41.760 --> 15:44.000
So I've got hills and gold in them.

15:44.000 --> 15:44.960
Yes, exactly.

15:44.960 --> 15:46.880
There's gold, whatever the hills are in your life.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.120
Are you talking about my lovely lumps?

15:49.120 --> 15:49.760
Ooh.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.120
There's gold in them hills.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.960
There's gold in my lovely lumps?

15:52.960 --> 16:01.040
Okay, now I will say Griffin, if history has proven anything, yes, there is gold in them

16:01.040 --> 16:02.080
there lumps.

16:02.080 --> 16:02.960
Okay, wow.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.200
That could be good.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.000
I have one here.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.840
This is the one that Theresa pitched to me.

16:07.840 --> 16:08.800
Oh, yes.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.760
That I love, and I've been very excited to share with you.

16:11.760 --> 16:12.240
Okay.

16:12.240 --> 16:17.600
Refined Teen, the Champagne of Years.

16:18.880 --> 16:22.960
Refined Teen, so let's get Fancy Nancy on it is what you're saying.

16:22.960 --> 16:23.280
Yes.

16:23.280 --> 16:25.680
Refined Teen.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.120
Oh, it's that D in there, isn't it?

16:27.120 --> 16:27.440
It's that naughty-

16:27.440 --> 16:29.680
Well, we can go with Refined Teen.

16:30.640 --> 16:31.760
Get fancy, get fancy on that.

16:31.760 --> 16:33.040
The Champagne of Years.

16:33.040 --> 16:36.000
The Champagne of Years is extremely powerful.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.560
Yeah, what I like about it is that it gives us the highest probability of failure we've

16:40.560 --> 16:42.000
ever had in a theme.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.360
It could just be like twenty-fine teen, the Champagne of Years, but I don't know if that

16:47.360 --> 16:52.640
gets it as across as Refined Teen, the Champagne of Years.

16:52.640 --> 16:55.680
Now, this year would be all about like, are you worth it?

16:55.680 --> 16:56.720
Yeah, you're worth it.

16:56.720 --> 16:58.080
It's the Champagne of Years.

16:59.440 --> 17:04.320
Yeah, oh, you should have a mimosa today, or like, yeah, go buy yourself those shoes

17:04.320 --> 17:05.600
you've been looking at.

17:05.600 --> 17:09.760
It's kind of a you're worth it is the whole deal of this year, and you make this year

17:10.800 --> 17:11.600
nice for you.

17:11.600 --> 17:13.600
And maybe it's like sleeping in, you know?

17:14.160 --> 17:21.040
We are an oscillating fan for these fucking suggestions, these yearly mottos going between

17:21.040 --> 17:27.520
get out there, make it better, do it together, and just fucking it's all about you, baby.

17:27.520 --> 17:29.200
It's all about you this year, baby.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.640
And maybe that's a natural process.

17:30.640 --> 17:34.560
You've got to treat yourself and then go out and treat others because how can you know

17:34.560 --> 17:36.640
real love before you know love yourself?

17:36.640 --> 17:37.600
I should know.

17:37.600 --> 17:38.720
Damn, that's good, Trav.

17:38.720 --> 17:40.960
Yeah, is this anything?

17:41.520 --> 17:48.160
Is it anything, if I were to say 20-fine-teen, fine, okay, fine.

17:48.880 --> 17:52.960
So wait, like 20-fine-teen, I get it.

17:52.960 --> 17:55.440
Fine, okay, fine.

17:55.440 --> 17:59.680
Yeah, and that's like a sort of acceptance, or is it like a sort of-

17:59.680 --> 18:00.400
It's acceptance.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.000
It's very powerful acceptance.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.920
But it sounds like a begrudging acceptance.

18:03.920 --> 18:07.760
Yeah, we shouldn't necessarily be espousing that, I feel like.

18:07.760 --> 18:11.040
It's not fine, for the most part.

18:11.760 --> 18:13.600
So that's the worst one yet.

18:13.600 --> 18:18.080
I got actually on the other end of the spectrum, undermine-teen, destroy it from within.

18:20.400 --> 18:26.720
And in this one, you're sort of a Splinter Cell agent inside the machine of your office,

18:26.720 --> 18:33.760
the government, business, just anything like that.

18:33.760 --> 18:36.000
Anything you can destroy from within, really.

18:36.000 --> 18:36.560
Yeah, sure.

18:36.560 --> 18:37.120
Sure.

18:37.120 --> 18:38.960
Even if it's just like a group chat.

18:39.600 --> 18:43.120
Yeah, and take that shit apart, plank by plank, nail by nail.

18:43.120 --> 18:45.680
20-pine-teen, man, that smells good.

18:45.680 --> 18:51.840
Write your own dumb themes in this document that Griffin isn't even in, please, please.

18:51.840 --> 18:54.240
I can't keep up with all these dumbass ideas.

18:54.240 --> 18:58.160
Okay, I actually have a winner here, but I was gonna save it for last, so it could win.

18:58.160 --> 19:01.520
Before I get to it, realign-teen, new priorities, new you.

19:01.520 --> 19:04.160
Ooh.

19:04.160 --> 19:10.320
But the winner here is clearly 20-shine-teen, unbushel your candle.

19:11.680 --> 19:14.400
20-shine-teen, unbushel your candle.

19:14.400 --> 19:15.200
Okay.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.280
Hiding your light under a bushel.

19:21.040 --> 19:23.840
You know what, I wanna put a star next to it, I really like it.

19:23.840 --> 19:26.320
Shine-teen, 20-shine-teen, unbushel your candle.

19:26.320 --> 19:30.080
I think shine-teen is good, unbushel your candle is good.

19:30.080 --> 19:33.280
Refine-teen, the champagne of years is definitely up there for me.

19:33.280 --> 19:35.680
And I'm gonna just go ahead and say Frankenstein-teen.

19:36.480 --> 19:38.960
See, I feel like we're not circling back to that one.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.920
I wanna chunk out a few more good, I really like the CS calling though.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.920
I'm gonna mark that one just for myself.

19:45.120 --> 19:47.360
Here's one that I wanted to hit you guys with.

19:47.360 --> 19:51.120
20-bloodline-teen, there's power in your ancestry.

19:51.120 --> 19:53.120
Well, I think we could just do bloodline-teen.

19:53.120 --> 19:55.520
I don't think you need the 20 in there, just bloodline-teen.

19:55.520 --> 19:58.800
Bloodline-teen, there's power in your ancestry.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.920
So you go back and you're like, there's power in there.

20:01.920 --> 20:02.640
You know what I mean?

20:02.640 --> 20:04.000
You're looking at your family tree,

20:04.000 --> 20:06.720
there's some power in there that you've yet to unearth.

20:06.720 --> 20:07.120
Yeah.

20:07.120 --> 20:09.520
Now, once again, I have to ask, Justin,

20:09.520 --> 20:11.680
metaphorical power or literal power?

20:13.360 --> 20:18.960
Well, no, Travis, you're not gonna find a fucking cross to kill vampires with.

20:18.960 --> 20:19.520
You don't know?

20:19.520 --> 20:23.120
It's not like a secret power, it's just like a power.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.880
So what you're saying is just looking at an old piece of paper

20:26.880 --> 20:29.360
with a bunch of names on it gives you power?

20:29.360 --> 20:32.160
Yeah, I looked at Dad's 23 and me, he did.

20:32.160 --> 20:33.600
There is no power.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.480
We have no power.

20:34.480 --> 20:35.760
There's no power in there.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.880
It's not a good one.

20:40.960 --> 20:44.000
What other words rhyme with nine, huh?

20:44.720 --> 20:48.400
20-twine-teen, we all get really good at indie game development.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.200
That could be great.

20:51.680 --> 20:52.480
I think we're done.

20:52.480 --> 20:53.040
I think we're done.

20:53.040 --> 20:54.400
I think we need to pick from the list.

20:54.400 --> 20:57.360
I think let's go through this and let's just get rid of the ones

20:57.360 --> 20:58.720
that it's not going to be.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.960
20-online-teen, the web is waiting.

21:02.160 --> 21:02.560
Oh, shit.

21:02.560 --> 21:03.360
Okay, wait, wait.

21:03.360 --> 21:04.560
Fuck it, fuck it, flip it.

21:04.560 --> 21:07.200
Offline-teen, unplug, renew.

21:08.240 --> 21:10.480
Well, our business is the internet, Griffin.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.960
I don't know that we would encourage our whole audience.

21:12.960 --> 21:16.240
Offline-teen, except for my brother, my brother and me

21:16.240 --> 21:18.320
and the adventurers, all of our podcasts.

21:18.320 --> 21:19.440
All of our podcasts.

21:19.440 --> 21:26.080
My friend and yours, Lin-Manuel Miranda, has come in with a late suggestion of 20-now-gene,

21:26.080 --> 21:26.880
moisturize it.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.640
It's very powerful.

21:30.640 --> 21:32.240
He said to get sponsorship for that one.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.920
He's a better writer than us, so maybe that is the best one.

21:35.920 --> 21:36.420
Shit.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.880
20-love-line-teen, bring it back with us in it.

21:40.880 --> 21:41.920
Yeah.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.120
That's a subtitle.

21:43.120 --> 21:46.480
I do, honestly, let me tell you why I like brine-teen.

21:46.480 --> 21:51.200
The Sea is Calling, because we're already going to be going on the cruise,

21:51.200 --> 21:54.080
so we've kind of built ourselves in a check mark.

21:54.080 --> 21:54.880
But it's not...

21:55.840 --> 21:57.200
These aren't for us, Trav.

21:58.160 --> 21:58.880
Okay, well.

21:58.880 --> 21:59.600
They're not for us.

22:00.080 --> 22:01.200
They are for us.

22:01.840 --> 22:02.960
They're for everyone.

22:02.960 --> 22:04.560
For everyone and us, mainly.

22:04.560 --> 22:06.960
We need to make The Sea is Calling a bit broader.

22:06.960 --> 22:10.000
We need to broaden our definitions, because there's people living in South Dakota

22:10.000 --> 22:11.200
who listen to this podcast.

22:12.080 --> 22:16.240
The Sea is so far away that it's not even close to the ocean.

22:16.240 --> 22:18.800
You can't hear the whispers of the sea.

22:18.800 --> 22:21.760
It's a metaphorical sea!

22:22.400 --> 22:24.480
20 brine-teen, build a boat in your tub.

22:26.960 --> 22:28.720
20 brine-teen, build an ark.

22:30.240 --> 22:30.960
It could happen.

22:31.520 --> 22:32.400
Two of each animal.

22:33.120 --> 22:35.920
Justin, when you say the sea is metaphorical.

22:35.920 --> 22:36.420
Yes.

22:37.040 --> 22:38.960
Why are all of yours metaphorical?

22:38.960 --> 22:39.440
All the things...

22:39.440 --> 22:40.560
Because they're more powerful.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.160
Metaphors are more powerful that way.

22:42.160 --> 22:46.720
But because the sea is whatever it has kept you from achieving your goals.

22:46.720 --> 22:50.160
Whatever you're afraid of, whatever you don't want to delve into, it's calling you.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.280
The sea is calling.

22:52.480 --> 22:54.160
Adventure, new opportunities.

22:54.160 --> 22:55.920
I don't know what's wasting the sea.

22:55.920 --> 22:56.480
That's the...

22:56.480 --> 22:57.280
No, Siri.

22:57.280 --> 22:57.760
Oh, man.

22:57.760 --> 23:00.400
I do not know what to make of that.

23:00.400 --> 23:02.720
20 brine-teen, Siri is calling.

23:02.720 --> 23:04.880
It's just you don't know what's out there in the sea.

23:04.880 --> 23:06.320
You gotta get out there to find out.

23:06.320 --> 23:09.040
I don't know what the sea wants with you.

23:09.040 --> 23:10.320
I just know that it's calling.

23:10.320 --> 23:11.200
Sure, sure.

23:11.200 --> 23:13.760
I will go with this if this is what you want to go with.

23:13.760 --> 23:16.320
But first, I want us to do a little exercise, okay?

23:16.320 --> 23:17.600
Are you boys ready for this?

23:17.600 --> 23:18.320
Yes.

23:18.320 --> 23:21.760
Okay, we're gonna role play something, the three of us, and we're really gonna do it.

23:21.760 --> 23:25.680
We're gonna start a new episode, and this will be episode...

23:26.240 --> 23:31.920
Wow, like 492, 93, 490 maybe?

23:31.920 --> 23:35.280
And it's a year from now, and we're trying to pick the 2020 theme,

23:35.280 --> 23:38.000
and we're going back and sort of talking about the previous themes.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.440
So let's just jump to that part, episode 490,

23:41.440 --> 23:44.960
where we are talking about 20 brine-teen, the sea is calling,

23:44.960 --> 23:49.760
a year later, just sort of figuring out if it was good or bad, and if we did it.

23:49.760 --> 23:53.200
Okay, hey, everybody, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

23:53.200 --> 23:55.120
brought to you by Burger King.

23:55.120 --> 23:59.280
It's your one-stop shop for the latest and greatest in burgers.

23:59.280 --> 24:04.000
I'm gonna throw it over to my co-host, Jimmy Fallon, who's here with me.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.080
Hey, guys, meet Jimmy Fallon.

24:06.080 --> 24:08.720
Oh, it's 20 brine-teen.

24:08.720 --> 24:11.840
Well, to wrap it up, 20 brine-teen is almost done here.

24:12.800 --> 24:13.760
The sea is calling.

24:13.760 --> 24:14.880
Did we do it?

24:14.880 --> 24:16.400
Jocotron is here.

24:16.400 --> 24:20.640
Jocotron needs more blood to operate and create...

24:20.640 --> 24:21.840
Oh, not again.

24:21.840 --> 24:24.320
Now Jimmy Fallon's gotta murder someone else.

24:24.320 --> 24:26.080
Anyway, I've been Howard Stern.

24:26.080 --> 24:28.240
That's all the episode we've got for today.

24:28.240 --> 24:34.960
I got time to talk about the year those brothers came up with.

24:34.960 --> 24:38.000
They called it 20 brine-teen, the sea is calling.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.200
They were, of course, tragically killed at sea,

24:41.200 --> 24:44.400
so that name has become extremely ironic now.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.680
What do you think of name Annihilation Alien?

24:47.680 --> 24:50.240
Whoa, because that really came true.

24:51.040 --> 24:52.320
Definitely became true.

24:52.320 --> 24:54.800
Okay, I'm gonna push back to 20 shine-teen.

24:54.800 --> 24:56.240
Unbushel your candle.

24:56.240 --> 24:58.240
I think it is...

24:58.240 --> 24:59.120
Here's my worry.

24:59.120 --> 25:04.720
I think it is powerful, but I worry that it may be too generically powerful.

25:04.720 --> 25:09.760
I don't know that we can necessarily harness that energy.

25:10.320 --> 25:13.360
I'm not sure the energy is specific enough with 20 shine-teen.

25:13.920 --> 25:15.280
Because there's some people...

25:15.280 --> 25:16.880
Hey, I don't know if you guys have been on the internet.

25:16.880 --> 25:20.640
There's some people who I would like for them to keep their candle bright where it is.

25:20.640 --> 25:21.120
Thank you.

25:22.960 --> 25:26.400
I will say that is a worry that unbushel your candle

25:26.400 --> 25:31.760
does have a bit of like entendre to it that I don't care for.

25:31.760 --> 25:32.720
Get your pee pee out.

25:32.720 --> 25:34.160
Yeah, Travis is right.

25:34.160 --> 25:35.680
All right, 20 shine-teen is done.

25:35.680 --> 25:37.600
I tell you, I really like refine-teen.

25:37.600 --> 25:40.000
It's just the meter of it I don't like.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.360
It's the, you know?

25:43.360 --> 25:45.440
It's gotta be four syllables, I feel like.

25:46.160 --> 25:49.280
Twine refine-teen, twine refine-teen.

25:49.280 --> 25:51.520
I'm not giving up on refine-teen.

25:51.520 --> 25:53.600
It's just you gotta make it work phonetically.

25:55.040 --> 25:56.400
I'm not saying that I think...

25:56.400 --> 25:57.600
I'm not sure 20...

25:57.600 --> 25:59.600
I think the C is calling is good.

25:59.600 --> 26:03.760
I don't think 20 brine-teen is extremely powerful.

26:03.760 --> 26:05.120
It can't be another one.

26:05.120 --> 26:08.320
It can't be 20 Kevin Klein-teen, the C is calling.

26:08.320 --> 26:10.560
No, that's what it is exactly.

26:10.560 --> 26:11.680
Now, could it?

26:11.680 --> 26:14.480
It's Kevin Klein-teen, the C is calling.

26:14.480 --> 26:17.200
It's Kevin Klein-teen, you gonna eat that pickle?

26:22.320 --> 26:24.480
Kevin Klein-teen, the champagne of years.

26:24.480 --> 26:25.200
Kevin Klein-teen...

26:25.200 --> 26:26.320
It works with all these.

26:26.320 --> 26:28.400
Kevin Klein-teen, destroy it from within.

26:28.400 --> 26:34.880
Turpentine-teen, start it over.

26:34.880 --> 26:36.560
We're just looking at rhyme zone.

26:36.560 --> 26:38.240
We're just looking at rhyme zone.

26:38.240 --> 26:39.760
We're just looking at rhyme zone.

26:39.760 --> 26:41.600
Oh, rhyme zone, good call Griffin.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.800
Now, we haven't done anything with swine-teen.

26:45.520 --> 26:46.960
Pearls before swine-teen.

26:48.160 --> 26:49.920
No one appreciates your art.

26:49.920 --> 26:51.840
It seems like a wild thing to just...

26:51.840 --> 26:54.480
That seems more like an observation than a goal.

26:54.480 --> 26:56.000
We're getting further from it.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.600
We're getting further from it.

26:57.600 --> 26:59.760
And further from listenability, too.

26:59.760 --> 27:02.080
What would you think about equine-teen?

27:02.800 --> 27:04.320
This year we get a horse.

27:04.320 --> 27:05.760
We're starting back over.

27:05.760 --> 27:07.520
I like themes of renewal.

27:08.640 --> 27:10.240
That's powerful to me.

27:10.240 --> 27:13.280
There's just not many good words that rhyme with nine, I feel like.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.520
Strict-nine-teen.

27:15.520 --> 27:16.240
No, come on.

27:16.880 --> 27:18.640
We need to get fucking serious about this.

27:18.640 --> 27:19.680
Oh, okay.

27:19.680 --> 27:20.880
Oh, what about this?

27:20.880 --> 27:22.240
Okay, are you ready for this?

27:23.520 --> 27:26.320
Tagline-teen, that's the tagline.

27:26.320 --> 27:28.880
The tagline-teen, that's the tagline is good.

27:28.880 --> 27:31.360
And this would be like us taking a year off.

27:31.360 --> 27:34.560
Yeah, kind of giving ourselves infallibility.

27:34.560 --> 27:35.920
What do you think about this?

27:35.920 --> 27:38.320
Fine-wine-teen, the champagne of years.

27:39.120 --> 27:42.800
That does sound kind of like we're saying to have actual champagne,

27:42.800 --> 27:45.520
which there are lots of people that may not be into that.

27:45.520 --> 27:47.760
I think I'm becoming okay with refined-teen.

27:47.760 --> 27:50.640
I just can't, the meter.

27:50.640 --> 27:51.520
I can't do the meter.

27:51.520 --> 27:55.520
What about wine-and-dine-teen, the champagne of years?

27:55.520 --> 27:57.040
I don't want wine to be in it, I don't think.

27:57.040 --> 27:57.760
Okay, okay.

27:58.480 --> 28:01.440
Clandestine-teen, keep it quiet.

28:01.440 --> 28:03.600
I feel like we do a lot of do bad,

28:04.320 --> 28:07.280
like zigzag on them and do, you know, grifts.

28:07.280 --> 28:08.880
I feel like maybe we should-

28:08.880 --> 28:09.840
Is this anything?

28:09.840 --> 28:11.760
Genuine-teen, keep it real.

28:12.560 --> 28:13.760
Genuine-teen.

28:13.760 --> 28:14.800
Ooh.

28:14.800 --> 28:18.000
Genuine-teen, jump on it, my pony.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.040
My saddle's waiting.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.360
Come in, jump on it.

28:21.360 --> 28:24.480
Built-in theme song, I like that of it.

28:24.480 --> 28:26.160
Now, I'm just gonna say this out loud

28:26.160 --> 28:27.440
so no one tweets it at me.

28:27.440 --> 28:30.240
Sparkling wine-teen, the champagne of years.

28:30.240 --> 28:31.040
Okay, yeah.

28:31.040 --> 28:32.720
What we need to do, stop.

28:32.720 --> 28:34.080
We're going at this backwards.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.560
We need to figure out what do we want the message to be?

28:36.560 --> 28:37.840
And then we'll work backwards from there.

28:37.840 --> 28:39.760
What do we want people to actually do?

28:40.800 --> 28:44.240
Because a lot of the time, I want to do a sort of new message.

28:44.240 --> 28:45.760
I want it to be attainable.

28:45.760 --> 28:50.000
I don't want it to be, you know, forward, move forward.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.680
Like that shit is so, like people know to do that shit.

28:53.680 --> 28:55.200
Okay, so what do you want to tell them?

28:56.320 --> 28:58.320
That's what the three of us have to figure out, Travie.

28:59.200 --> 29:03.440
We have told people something about heaven,

29:03.440 --> 29:04.800
to get it, that's good.

29:05.360 --> 29:06.320
Dig it up, get it out.

29:06.320 --> 29:08.880
So they got it and then they dug it up

29:08.880 --> 29:11.120
and then they moved on in 20 forward, right?

29:11.680 --> 29:14.800
And then we step back with 20 grift-teen, the con is on.

29:14.800 --> 29:17.760
So that was sort of like, you got it, you dug it up,

29:17.760 --> 29:21.520
you moved on and you took what you learned to fool other people.

29:21.520 --> 29:24.160
And then we felt bad about that in 2016.

29:24.160 --> 29:26.080
So we decided to build some bridges

29:26.080 --> 29:27.440
to get people back together.

29:27.440 --> 29:29.040
But then while we were building the bridges,

29:29.040 --> 29:30.480
we got a little too predictable.

29:30.480 --> 29:34.640
So we had to zag on them, but then that was a little fishier.

29:34.640 --> 29:36.800
So we're kind of got a rhythm and then starting together,

29:36.800 --> 29:38.000
we're working together again.

29:38.000 --> 29:43.040
So we conned, we built bridges, we zagged, we worked together.

29:43.040 --> 29:46.160
So there's kind of a, so, and even going back to 2013,

29:46.160 --> 29:48.880
we dug it up, got dirty and then 20 forward,

29:48.880 --> 29:50.160
we moved forward with it.

29:50.160 --> 29:53.040
So I feel like we do have sort of a rhythm of-

29:53.040 --> 29:53.680
Yeah, yeah.

29:54.480 --> 29:56.800
And we are due for like a more-

29:57.920 --> 29:58.480
Uplifting?

29:59.360 --> 30:00.640
Might I suggest more scrupulous-

30:00.640 --> 30:02.160
Oh, we're due for a nasty one.

30:02.160 --> 30:03.840
We're due for a nasty one, yes.

30:03.840 --> 30:06.160
What about, because I just saw this one

30:06.160 --> 30:11.200
and it gave me an idea, 20 divine-teen, the magic's in you.

30:11.200 --> 30:12.480
The rhythm, the rhythm.

30:12.480 --> 30:13.360
The rhythm's not good.

30:13.360 --> 30:13.680
It has to be-

30:13.680 --> 30:15.520
Divine-teen, fuck.

30:15.520 --> 30:17.040
Yeah, it's the same as refined-teen.

30:17.600 --> 30:18.640
It's the wrong rhythm.

30:18.640 --> 30:21.440
You gotta have three syllables or one syllable

30:21.440 --> 30:22.400
with a 20 in front of it.

30:22.400 --> 30:23.200
Okay, what about this?

30:23.840 --> 30:26.080
Asinine-teen, get silly with it.

30:26.800 --> 30:28.240
No, because the cursing in it.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.720
Asinine isn't cursing.

30:30.720 --> 30:33.040
But people will make it about the ass part, Travis.

30:33.040 --> 30:34.960
You've been on the fucking internet, man.

30:34.960 --> 30:36.160
You know how these people do it.

30:36.880 --> 30:40.720
How about powerline-teen, eye to eye?

30:43.360 --> 30:44.400
That was just for Travis.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.160
A goofy movie one just for Travis.

30:46.160 --> 30:51.280
Powerline-teen, like, amp it up, or powerline-teen.

30:51.280 --> 30:56.640
That sounds like an energy drink, which I'm kinda into.

30:57.280 --> 30:58.560
We are not gonna do any questions

30:58.560 --> 30:59.840
this episode is starting to feel like,

30:59.840 --> 31:01.200
and potentially no ads.

31:03.840 --> 31:04.800
Whoops.

31:04.800 --> 31:06.000
It's moving in that direction.

31:07.120 --> 31:08.080
Should we just take the year off?

31:08.080 --> 31:09.760
Should we just not do one this year?

31:09.760 --> 31:14.640
What about Frankenstein-teen with a more powerful message,

31:14.640 --> 31:22.160
such as, become unkillable, or Frankenstein-teen, fire bad.

31:22.160 --> 31:23.040
That's useful.

31:24.640 --> 31:28.720
Oh, what about Frankenstein-teen, become the monster.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.680
And that one's less like, don't be afraid of the monster,

31:31.680 --> 31:33.200
become the monster.

31:33.200 --> 31:34.560
I kind of like that.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.360
I think that's extraordinarily powerful.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.560
That is powerful, that really gets it.

31:40.560 --> 31:43.520
I said it, I said it, but I don't know what it means.

31:43.520 --> 31:45.440
And maybe we spend a year unpacking it,

31:45.440 --> 31:47.680
but Frankenstein-teen, become the monster.

31:47.680 --> 31:50.160
Become the monster is really working for me.

31:50.160 --> 31:52.160
That is extremely good, Griffin.

31:53.120 --> 31:55.120
It doesn't mean to do bad stuff.

31:55.120 --> 31:56.000
No, no, no.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.520
If you can't beat the monster, become the monster.

32:00.080 --> 32:01.520
I think that's it, that's it.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.040
Let's move, we got it, let's do it.

32:03.040 --> 32:04.320
That's it, we got it in one,

32:04.320 --> 32:06.160
and now it's time for a quick trick to the money zone.

32:06.160 --> 32:23.120
I'm so excited for the visual possibilities

32:23.120 --> 32:24.480
of Frankenstein-teen.

32:24.480 --> 32:26.320
Frankenstein's not trademarked, is he?

32:26.320 --> 32:27.200
No.

32:27.200 --> 32:31.120
Okay, so we got some sponsors?

32:31.120 --> 32:32.000
Yes, no?

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Just one, just one very special one.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.800
Yeah, let's all get a hand on this ball though,

32:36.800 --> 32:38.240
because it's Stitch Fix.

32:38.880 --> 32:42.240
A lot of people now just comment on any of our Instagrams,

32:42.240 --> 32:45.680
just like, well, this picture is brought to you by Stitch Fix,

32:45.680 --> 32:49.840
because we're almost always just head to toe, to bow to stern.

32:49.840 --> 32:54.240
We sat around at Candle Nights in the backstage area,

32:54.240 --> 32:58.000
like everyone there, like Stitch Fix, Stitch Fix, Stitch Fix?

32:58.000 --> 32:58.800
Yeah, it was wild.

32:58.800 --> 33:00.160
Oh, that's Stitch Fix.

33:00.160 --> 33:02.000
It's an online personal styling service

33:02.000 --> 33:04.080
that finds and delivers clothes, shoes, and accessories

33:04.080 --> 33:06.560
to fit your body budget and lifestyle.

33:06.560 --> 33:09.360
I've been using it for the better part of this year,

33:09.360 --> 33:13.200
and I've almost completely changed my wardrobe,

33:13.200 --> 33:16.000
and I dress much better.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.920
I feel a lot better about the clothes that I wear.

33:18.560 --> 33:20.160
If you don't like something they send you,

33:20.160 --> 33:21.440
you just send it right back.

33:21.440 --> 33:23.360
All the shipping is covered,

33:23.360 --> 33:25.200
and their styling fee is just 20 bucks,

33:25.200 --> 33:28.320
which is applied toward anything you keep from your shipment.

33:28.320 --> 33:29.520
When you go to pay for it,

33:29.520 --> 33:32.640
you can both rank the fit and the price,

33:32.640 --> 33:34.160
and how well it matches your style,

33:34.160 --> 33:36.480
and leave little comments, and they'll listen to that.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.080
And it's not just shirts and pants.

33:38.080 --> 33:42.640
I also get jackets in there, socks, shoes.

33:42.640 --> 33:46.080
I've gotten some really great shoes out of my Stitch Fix boxes.

33:46.080 --> 33:48.320
They sent me some Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

33:49.040 --> 33:49.840
Really?

33:49.840 --> 33:52.320
Yeah, I really needed them, but they fit my body.

33:52.960 --> 33:54.160
That's amazing, Griffin.

33:54.160 --> 33:55.120
Yeah, it was cool.

33:55.120 --> 33:56.400
If you want to get started right now,

33:56.400 --> 33:59.120
you can go to stitchfix.com slash my brother,

33:59.120 --> 34:01.680
and you'll get an extra 25% off

34:01.680 --> 34:03.200
when you keep all the items in your box.

34:03.200 --> 34:07.120
That's stitchfix.com slash my brother.

34:07.120 --> 34:09.520
To get started today, one more time that address,

34:10.160 --> 34:13.680
stitchfix.com slash my brother.

34:14.560 --> 34:15.520
Beginning this summer,

34:15.520 --> 34:17.520
you can listen to new episodes of Inside Pop

34:17.520 --> 34:20.080
every other week for an even deeper dive

34:20.080 --> 34:21.520
inside the world of pop culture.

34:22.160 --> 34:24.560
Now we're still bringing you our brilliant insight,

34:24.560 --> 34:26.080
always on the nose opinions,

34:26.080 --> 34:28.000
and insider-y inside information

34:28.000 --> 34:30.480
on the most interesting pop culture stories of the week.

34:31.200 --> 34:32.720
And we'll also have interviews

34:32.720 --> 34:34.320
with the pop culture professionals

34:34.320 --> 34:36.320
who create the culture you crave.

34:36.320 --> 34:38.240
For example, we'll speak to casting directors

34:38.240 --> 34:41.120
about how they find the right talent for the right role.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.640
We'll talk to music supervisors

34:42.640 --> 34:45.760
about how they choose the music to create the right mood.

34:45.760 --> 34:46.880
And we'll grill producers.

34:46.880 --> 34:49.760
We'll discuss what exactly a producer does.

34:50.560 --> 34:52.720
Oh man, Sean, how many times has someone said to you,

34:52.720 --> 34:55.200
oh, you're a producer, so what do you actually do?

34:55.200 --> 34:58.000
So many times.

34:59.120 --> 34:59.680
Same here.

35:00.320 --> 35:02.400
So make sure to catch Inside Pop

35:02.400 --> 35:04.640
every other Wednesday on Maximum Fun

35:04.640 --> 35:07.360
to indulge your pop culture obsessions.

35:07.360 --> 35:08.960
And to hear in-depth interviews

35:08.960 --> 35:10.640
from the movers and the shakers

35:10.640 --> 35:12.400
in TV, music, film, and more.

35:13.920 --> 35:15.680
How about a question, Justin?

35:15.680 --> 35:16.720
Our first question,

35:16.720 --> 35:18.800
probably a good 35 minutes into the show.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.520
Real quick, before we get to that,

35:22.080 --> 35:22.960
I just wanted to,

35:22.960 --> 35:25.360
we got a really important email here from Tyler

35:25.360 --> 35:26.480
that I wanted to read.

35:26.480 --> 35:27.680
Riddle me piss.

35:28.240 --> 35:30.560
Tyler, you got me from Tyler.

35:30.560 --> 35:32.480
Wait, is Tyler actually the name of the person

35:32.480 --> 35:34.800
who submitted this riddle or did you just make up Tyler?

35:34.800 --> 35:36.240
Tyler really did submit.

35:36.240 --> 35:38.560
Oh, yes, Tyler submitted the riddle.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.440
I like riddle me piss, Trav,

35:41.440 --> 35:43.760
but the voice is what really kills it.

35:43.760 --> 35:45.280
Riddle me piss, boys.

35:45.840 --> 35:47.440
Yeah, piss boys is fun.

35:47.440 --> 35:48.080
All right, I'm ready.

35:49.280 --> 35:51.440
So, you're a math whiz.

35:51.440 --> 35:54.400
You know, two nickels is 20 cents.

35:54.960 --> 35:58.960
How much is 1000 Canadian pennies?

36:00.320 --> 36:03.680
Yeah, this sounds more like the setup of a joke than-

36:03.680 --> 36:05.360
There's a lot to unpack here.

36:05.360 --> 36:07.360
Yeah, because, yeah.

36:07.360 --> 36:09.520
Because two nickels is not 20 cents.

36:09.520 --> 36:11.280
Not 20 cents traditionally, mathematically,

36:11.280 --> 36:13.360
using the sort of our math.

36:13.360 --> 36:16.800
I also really enjoy a riddle that starts

36:16.800 --> 36:18.560
with an aggressive chap.

36:18.560 --> 36:20.480
So, you're a math whiz.

36:20.480 --> 36:26.640
Yeah, I'm gonna say 1000 cents,

36:26.640 --> 36:29.280
which I believe is $10 Canadian,

36:29.280 --> 36:32.000
which I think means $10 Canadian,

36:32.000 --> 36:35.840
I'm pretty sure is like 940 American.

36:36.480 --> 36:38.560
Justin, do you have a solution?

36:38.560 --> 36:40.240
Is it 10 Canadian dollars?

36:41.120 --> 36:44.000
How much is 1000 Canadian pennies?

36:44.000 --> 36:45.520
Answer, nothing.

36:45.520 --> 36:47.760
In Canada, pennies are worthless.

36:47.760 --> 36:55.360
All right, so this is sort of a Canadian joke

36:55.360 --> 36:59.680
about how they don't like their smallest form of currency,

37:00.400 --> 37:02.800
which is, I think, sort of applicable everywhere.

37:02.800 --> 37:05.360
Like, I don't think much of the humble penny either,

37:05.360 --> 37:08.640
but I don't know why you had to make it Canadian, Tyler.

37:08.640 --> 37:09.840
Yeah, Tyler.

37:09.840 --> 37:11.760
Tyler just emailed it to me.

37:11.760 --> 37:12.480
Okay.

37:12.480 --> 37:15.040
This is from riddlemaster555.

37:15.040 --> 37:18.960
Gregory commented, pennies aren't worthless in Canada,

37:18.960 --> 37:20.960
they just aren't produced anymore.

37:20.960 --> 37:23.360
If anything, the alloy used to make them

37:23.360 --> 37:25.680
is worth more than the monetary value of the penny.

37:25.680 --> 37:27.920
So, yeah, it just completely takes your shit apart,

37:27.920 --> 37:28.800
I feel like.

37:28.800 --> 37:31.440
And, two nickels makes 10 cents.

37:31.440 --> 37:32.960
You're thinking of dimes.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.080
Dimes is, yeah, well,

37:34.080 --> 37:35.840
I don't know what a Canadian nickel's worth.

37:35.840 --> 37:38.640
Anyway, do you have any more riddles, riddlemaster?

37:38.640 --> 37:40.080
Not today.

37:40.080 --> 37:40.800
All right.

37:40.800 --> 37:44.160
I'm a 32-year-old very nerdy graphic designer,

37:44.160 --> 37:47.600
and I live slash work in a co-op apartment building.

37:47.600 --> 37:49.920
And there are many people of all ages living here,

37:49.920 --> 37:51.520
including what has been described

37:51.520 --> 37:53.840
as roving packs of teens.

37:53.840 --> 37:55.200
The other day, I was in the elevator

37:55.200 --> 37:56.560
with one of these so-called teens,

37:56.560 --> 37:57.760
and they said I looked cool.

37:58.560 --> 38:02.320
Man, I've never been cool my whole life.

38:02.320 --> 38:03.840
If a teen says you look cool,

38:03.840 --> 38:05.280
does that make you look cool?

38:05.280 --> 38:07.280
That's from keeping it cool in Canada.

38:07.280 --> 38:09.520
Oh, man, who was this teen?

38:10.800 --> 38:12.240
I'll tell you what teens don't like.

38:12.240 --> 38:14.400
I'm not gonna make a Fortnite or a vaping joke here,

38:14.400 --> 38:16.160
because we've done about a thousand of those.

38:16.800 --> 38:18.560
Although they do probably do like Fortnite.

38:18.560 --> 38:19.600
They play it on their iPhone.

38:21.680 --> 38:23.920
They are not complimenting people, though.

38:23.920 --> 38:26.800
I've never seen a teen do a compliment.

38:26.800 --> 38:30.560
I say that, there's probably nice teens out there

38:30.560 --> 38:33.600
who watch nice Netflix movies,

38:33.600 --> 38:35.040
like All the Boys I've Loved Before,

38:35.040 --> 38:38.080
and the message is just be good to each other.

38:38.080 --> 38:41.120
And so there are probably teens who are complimentary.

38:41.120 --> 38:42.960
I've never seen one, I only see the ones

38:42.960 --> 38:45.520
that do Heelys over my toes and crush my toes,

38:46.320 --> 38:47.440
because they weren't paying attention.

38:47.440 --> 38:49.840
Do the teens watch The Great British Baking Show?

38:50.400 --> 38:52.240
Do the kids watch that and then talk about it

38:52.240 --> 38:54.880
at their lockers like, oh, that was the bad bake, huh?

38:54.880 --> 38:56.080
Did you see that, Tyler?

38:56.080 --> 38:57.360
What, the bad bake?

38:57.360 --> 38:58.640
Oh yeah, I saw that.

38:58.640 --> 39:00.640
Yeah, they don't call it baking, though.

39:01.360 --> 39:03.920
They call it yeast blasting.

39:05.280 --> 39:08.240
Did the teens, did the teen when they said it,

39:08.240 --> 39:12.320
were they like, huh, you look cool, like that?

39:12.320 --> 39:15.040
Because that might have been, maybe it was like pejorative.

39:15.040 --> 39:16.480
There's a lot of variables here, yeah.

39:17.040 --> 39:20.160
The tone of voice, you look cool.

39:21.120 --> 39:23.200
Did they say like, you look cool,

39:23.200 --> 39:26.160
like a cool person that would buy teens alcohol?

39:26.160 --> 39:29.840
Oh yeah, did they maybe say, hey, are you cool?

39:30.640 --> 39:31.280
Are you cool?

39:31.280 --> 39:34.960
Do you know how to party, or do you party?

39:34.960 --> 39:36.160
You look cool, do you party?

39:36.160 --> 39:37.440
Are you cool?

39:37.440 --> 39:38.800
Are you a cool cop?

39:38.800 --> 39:39.600
Are you a cool cop?

39:40.560 --> 39:42.720
Hey, hey, you look, can I say something?

39:42.720 --> 39:43.520
You look weed.

39:47.360 --> 39:49.040
Yeah, and then another variable here

39:49.040 --> 39:50.880
is how cool did the teen look?

39:50.880 --> 39:53.840
Because if it was a real fucking poindexter saying,

39:55.840 --> 39:57.040
it just means you're cooler than them,

39:57.040 --> 39:59.200
which is probably still pretty low.

39:59.200 --> 40:01.680
The teens are bringing back styles from the 90s.

40:01.680 --> 40:03.680
I don't know if you guys keep up with teen fashion.

40:03.680 --> 40:04.480
It's back.

40:04.480 --> 40:05.200
Always.

40:05.200 --> 40:08.080
So the nice thing is, if you don't update your shit,

40:08.080 --> 40:10.240
eventually you're gonna circle back around,

40:10.240 --> 40:11.520
and you will have a window.

40:11.520 --> 40:13.680
You may just be in your window right now.

40:13.680 --> 40:14.960
Like, Friends is back.

40:15.760 --> 40:17.360
Like, Hygiene's are back.

40:18.080 --> 40:20.080
Yeah, Hygiene is back.

40:20.080 --> 40:23.200
Were you wearing like a Ross sweater?

40:23.200 --> 40:24.640
Because that might have done it.

40:24.640 --> 40:26.960
Yeah, did you look like a real Ross?

40:26.960 --> 40:28.800
Did you look like a real Ross?

40:28.800 --> 40:29.440
Real Ross.

40:29.440 --> 40:30.960
If they're cool, if they said you're cool,

40:30.960 --> 40:32.160
you don't look like Ross, all right?

40:32.160 --> 40:32.640
You look like Joey.

40:32.640 --> 40:34.080
You look like a Phoebe?

40:34.080 --> 40:35.360
Oh, a Joey.

40:35.360 --> 40:37.280
A Phoebe, the coolest friend?

40:37.280 --> 40:37.920
Yes, for sure.

40:38.800 --> 40:41.200
I think it's all backwards though now,

40:41.200 --> 40:44.080
because I think the kids like Ross.

40:44.080 --> 40:46.080
I think the kids are just crazy about Ross Geller.

40:47.360 --> 40:48.080
No.

40:48.080 --> 40:48.320
No.

40:48.960 --> 40:52.800
No, Griffin, there is no generation

40:52.800 --> 40:55.040
that will ever be into Ross Geller.

40:55.040 --> 40:55.520
That's fair.

40:56.320 --> 40:59.760
He was an impotent clown joke.

41:02.240 --> 41:03.280
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

41:03.280 --> 41:05.520
Don't tweet at me about friends.

41:05.520 --> 41:06.080
Listen.

41:06.080 --> 41:06.960
Please.

41:06.960 --> 41:07.920
Please don't.

41:07.920 --> 41:09.120
I won't appreciate it.

41:09.120 --> 41:10.400
I don't enjoy the program.

41:10.400 --> 41:11.840
Don't tweet at me about friends.

41:12.720 --> 41:13.040
Don't.

41:13.680 --> 41:14.400
It's important.

41:15.520 --> 41:18.160
Here is a Yahoo sent in by Nathan Smith.

41:18.160 --> 41:18.880
Thank you, Nathan.

41:18.880 --> 41:20.720
It's Yahoo Answers user Nathan,

41:22.000 --> 41:24.480
which is maybe just an unfortunate coincidence.

41:24.480 --> 41:25.680
The question's from 2010,

41:25.680 --> 41:26.240
so I don't think this is Nathan.

41:26.240 --> 41:30.400
I wrote this great Yahoo eight years ago.

41:30.400 --> 41:33.440
Okay, well, let's help Nathan out.

41:33.440 --> 41:35.040
This is the first time we've ever been able to get

41:35.760 --> 41:37.600
real hands-on help from the source.

41:37.600 --> 41:37.920
Yeah.

41:37.920 --> 41:38.880
From the source.

41:38.880 --> 41:39.760
Nathan asks,

41:39.760 --> 41:41.680
how can I get sponsored for parkour?

41:42.960 --> 41:44.960
Okay, I've been training parkour for six months,

41:44.960 --> 41:46.320
14 hours a day.

41:46.320 --> 41:49.680
No, I can do anything anyone wants me to do.

41:49.680 --> 41:52.320
For example, I just accomplished a quad kong vault

41:52.320 --> 41:53.280
outside the other day.

41:53.280 --> 41:54.320
No way.

41:54.320 --> 41:55.600
No fucking way, bruh.

41:55.600 --> 41:57.280
Nah, dude.

41:57.280 --> 41:58.560
It's one of the hardest tricks ever.

41:58.560 --> 42:00.240
I take this profession very seriously,

42:00.240 --> 42:02.480
and push myself to the best of my abilities every day.

42:03.600 --> 42:04.560
Real quick, there's a lot more,

42:04.560 --> 42:05.200
but real quick,

42:06.320 --> 42:09.360
can you even quantify the hardest parkour trick?

42:09.360 --> 42:12.640
It seems like you can always do more flips off a building.

42:12.640 --> 42:13.680
Do you know what I mean?

42:13.680 --> 42:15.200
It's a higher building, more flips.

42:15.200 --> 42:16.080
What happens, Griffin,

42:16.080 --> 42:17.760
is someone does a flip off the building,

42:17.760 --> 42:18.960
and their legs explode.

42:20.400 --> 42:22.800
And then you just take that back one flip.

42:22.800 --> 42:24.080
But then you get stronger legs.

42:24.080 --> 42:25.600
Anyway, trying to create-

42:25.600 --> 42:27.200
Real quick, quad kong vault,

42:27.200 --> 42:29.120
just so we have some context here.

42:29.120 --> 42:33.200
Imagine four obstacles in front of you, right?

42:33.200 --> 42:34.800
Like four-

42:34.800 --> 42:35.840
Like hurdles?

42:35.840 --> 42:37.040
Yeah, four hurdles, right?

42:38.320 --> 42:39.040
My depression.

42:41.360 --> 42:42.880
My sort of self-destructive-

42:42.880 --> 42:44.080
Your uprising, yeah.

42:44.080 --> 42:45.040
My upright, yeah.

42:45.680 --> 42:46.880
So upbringing, there's the word.

42:47.520 --> 42:50.080
So it's like, you jump up in the air,

42:50.080 --> 42:53.200
you land on the first obstacle on your hands,

42:53.200 --> 42:54.720
and without really losing momentum,

42:54.720 --> 42:58.640
you jump, you land on each of the four obstacles

42:58.640 --> 42:59.520
with your hands.

42:59.520 --> 43:00.000
So like-

43:00.000 --> 43:00.720
Okay.

43:00.720 --> 43:01.120
It's-

43:01.120 --> 43:02.240
So you don't use your feet?

43:03.760 --> 43:04.320
No.

43:04.320 --> 43:06.560
I mean, you use your feet to get it going,

43:06.560 --> 43:09.040
to get sort of it rolling.

43:09.040 --> 43:10.400
Is it faster than walking?

43:10.960 --> 43:12.640
I mean, if you got a good head of steam,

43:12.640 --> 43:14.000
it would be faster than walking.

43:14.000 --> 43:14.400
But that's-

43:14.400 --> 43:15.600
I have big strong hands.

43:15.600 --> 43:16.560
Oh, I'm watching it.

43:16.560 --> 43:18.640
I just saw someone do it without their feet.

43:18.640 --> 43:19.520
Yeah, this is good.

43:19.520 --> 43:20.960
Hey guys, can I ask another question?

43:20.960 --> 43:21.760
Did parkour-

43:21.760 --> 43:24.800
Is this just sort of an evolved version of

43:24.800 --> 43:28.080
the Monty Python Department of Silly Walking,

43:28.080 --> 43:29.040
if you think about it?

43:29.760 --> 43:30.560
But hard?

43:30.560 --> 43:31.600
Like they were doing that,

43:31.600 --> 43:32.480
but then they did it hard,

43:32.480 --> 43:34.000
and they're like, this is sports now.

43:34.000 --> 43:34.720
We got Justin-

43:34.720 --> 43:37.120
We got here just in time to make parkour jokes.

43:38.240 --> 43:40.000
They're not gonna fly in 2019.

43:40.000 --> 43:40.640
All right, yeah.

43:41.200 --> 43:42.800
No, because there's not gonna be room to breathe

43:42.800 --> 43:45.440
what with all the vegetable jokes I'm gonna be making.

43:45.440 --> 43:47.360
So I only went to a park-

43:47.360 --> 43:48.080
Please let me finish.

43:48.080 --> 43:48.960
Please let me finish.

43:48.960 --> 43:49.600
Uh-huh.

43:49.600 --> 43:51.360
I only went to a parkour gym once,

43:51.360 --> 43:53.520
then decided to learn parkour on YouTube carefully

43:53.520 --> 43:55.120
and was successful about it.

43:55.120 --> 43:55.520
I would like to-

43:55.520 --> 43:57.200
Well, thank God for the carefully part.

43:57.200 --> 43:57.680
For sure.

43:57.680 --> 43:58.880
I would like to get sponsored and go pro-

43:58.880 --> 44:00.560
My name, it's Parkour Jim.

44:01.440 --> 44:06.560
I'm gonna teach you everything you need to know.

44:06.560 --> 44:07.920
I'm not going for the money,

44:07.920 --> 44:09.760
but wanting to go for the experience

44:09.760 --> 44:11.360
and meet new people to learn new moves

44:11.360 --> 44:12.640
and bring my skill to the next level.

44:12.640 --> 44:13.760
Please give me a legit website

44:13.760 --> 44:14.800
and I will be deeply grateful.

44:14.800 --> 44:17.280
Have a great Christmas day for whoever celebrates it.

44:17.280 --> 44:21.600
That's good that these sort of progressive there at the end.

44:21.600 --> 44:22.640
So, hmm.

44:23.680 --> 44:30.480
I wanna do a trick with my body over a fire hydrant.

44:30.480 --> 44:34.320
So good that Taco Bell gives me a hundred thousand dollars.

44:34.320 --> 44:37.200
As long as I wear a sticker on my parkour pants.

44:37.200 --> 44:39.760
I'm gonna share a link here in the chat

44:39.760 --> 44:42.480
for the perfect website this person needs to go to.

44:42.480 --> 44:43.680
Okay, what's that, Travie?

44:43.680 --> 44:44.960
And keep in mind that they can't-

44:44.960 --> 44:47.440
Okay, holy shit, Trav, you're the best brother

44:47.440 --> 44:49.360
and best comedian of all time.

44:49.360 --> 44:52.240
Travis is maybe the greatest comedic mind of all time

44:52.240 --> 44:54.160
and I feel like nobody really appreciates.

44:54.960 --> 44:56.560
I mean, Travis has his fans for sure,

44:56.560 --> 44:58.080
but I don't think anybody really understands

44:58.080 --> 45:00.000
the true depth of your genius.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.280
Thank you very much, Kevin.

45:01.280 --> 45:05.760
So go ahead and say what the parkour sponsorship would be, Trav.

45:05.760 --> 45:06.320
Parquet.

45:06.880 --> 45:07.600
Yeah, the butter.

45:11.040 --> 45:11.680
I'm gonna get-

45:11.680 --> 45:13.440
And we should maybe give people a chance

45:13.440 --> 45:16.320
to really groove on it, really ride the wave.

45:19.120 --> 45:21.520
It comes in spread sticks and squeeze and spray bottles,

45:21.520 --> 45:22.160
if you're wondering.

45:22.160 --> 45:24.720
I'm looking at the website now, parquet.com.

45:24.720 --> 45:25.760
Don't give it away for,

45:25.760 --> 45:28.320
don't give the milk away for free, you silly cow.

45:28.320 --> 45:29.520
You gotta hold on to it.

45:30.960 --> 45:33.200
And don't, yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:33.200 --> 45:37.280
So you gotta go to the parquet factory and start-

45:37.280 --> 45:41.440
I'm looking to see if there's any kind of contact form.

45:41.440 --> 45:43.280
Oh, there is contact us?

45:43.280 --> 45:45.040
The parquet factory is going to have

45:45.040 --> 45:48.400
a giant industrial strength churner in there somewhere.

45:48.400 --> 45:49.680
You have to stunt.

45:49.680 --> 45:52.080
You gotta Kong flip all the fuck the way

45:52.080 --> 45:53.360
over that fucking thing.

45:53.360 --> 45:54.960
You gotta get, and people be scared.

45:54.960 --> 45:56.640
He's gonna fall in and become butter,

45:56.640 --> 45:59.120
but you don't because of your abilities.

45:59.120 --> 45:59.520
And then-

45:59.520 --> 46:01.680
It's gotta be slippery in there, they'll say.

46:01.680 --> 46:02.720
Oh, shit.

46:02.720 --> 46:05.440
Go in the parquet factory with your own butter in your pocket,

46:05.440 --> 46:08.480
spread it on the floor, slip, break your skull.

46:08.480 --> 46:10.720
Then parquet's gonna have to do a settlement for you

46:10.720 --> 46:12.080
and give you millions of dollars.

46:12.080 --> 46:12.960
And at the end of the day,

46:12.960 --> 46:15.120
you can say that's a sort of sponsorship.

46:15.120 --> 46:16.000
There you go.

46:16.000 --> 46:20.400
Or, ooh, spread out some of that competitive brand X butter

46:20.400 --> 46:22.400
and then spread out some parquet butter

46:22.400 --> 46:25.680
and see how easy it is to do it on the brand X butter

46:25.680 --> 46:26.880
because it's not slippery at all.

46:26.880 --> 46:29.360
And then try to do parkour on parquet and you're like,

46:29.360 --> 46:31.360
ah, this butter is the slipperiest.

46:31.360 --> 46:32.000
Yeah, for sure.

46:33.280 --> 46:33.760
That's good.

46:34.480 --> 46:35.280
We're done.

46:35.280 --> 46:38.560
My friend and I are on vacation in Ireland for the holidays.

46:38.560 --> 46:41.600
An old man at a bar and they've written here pub,

46:41.600 --> 46:43.120
I guess, because they're in Ireland.

46:43.120 --> 46:44.880
Like, yeah, we get it.

46:44.880 --> 46:48.560
No, that was an auto-cracked by Irish Google.

46:49.120 --> 46:50.880
It's Irish Clippy.

46:54.000 --> 46:58.960
You be trying to type a bar here in the Emerald Isle.

47:00.560 --> 47:01.680
Travis, you're closer to him.

47:01.680 --> 47:02.880
Swat his nose to the newspaper.

47:02.880 --> 47:05.120
I'm trying to get him, but he's in West Virginia.

47:05.120 --> 47:08.160
Just sit around, so the old man at the bar,

47:08.160 --> 47:10.000
just sent a round of beers over to our table

47:10.000 --> 47:11.600
and wished us a Merry Christmas.

47:11.600 --> 47:12.560
We were about to leave.

47:13.120 --> 47:13.760
What do we do?

47:14.320 --> 47:15.920
We're planning on drinking the beers.

47:15.920 --> 47:16.800
Good start.

47:16.800 --> 47:18.720
But we don't know if we're supposed to buy him

47:18.720 --> 47:19.840
and his friends around now.

47:21.120 --> 47:23.920
How do we leave this pub without seeming like ungrateful tourists?

47:23.920 --> 47:25.760
That's from Gifted in Guinness in Galway.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.600
Amp this to amp this shit up.

47:29.600 --> 47:32.800
I have only had a round bought for me once at a bar.

47:32.800 --> 47:34.800
I've only seen it done once and it was at

47:34.800 --> 47:38.800
my 10-year high school reunion.

47:38.800 --> 47:41.040
So that even escalated even more,

47:41.040 --> 47:43.760
because I got even more skin in the game here.

47:44.560 --> 47:46.640
The party who did buy the drinks did go around

47:46.640 --> 47:48.480
making sure everybody did get their drink,

47:48.480 --> 47:50.640
which is maybe a new way of doing this

47:50.640 --> 47:54.320
that is, I don't know, you could consider successful.

47:54.320 --> 47:58.240
What is the etiquette here for a round of brewskis?

47:58.240 --> 47:59.600
Here's what needs to happen.

47:59.600 --> 48:03.280
Bars need to start carrying incrementally larger glasses.

48:03.280 --> 48:07.120
So it's like, okay, you sent over like one pint.

48:07.120 --> 48:10.240
I'm gonna send back 1.1 pint of beer.

48:10.240 --> 48:11.040
Okay.

48:11.040 --> 48:11.520
Right?

48:11.520 --> 48:12.880
So it's like an investment.

48:12.880 --> 48:14.800
So it's like, I bought you a round.

48:14.800 --> 48:16.320
Oh, it paid off, right?

48:16.320 --> 48:20.800
My investment paid off and now I'm getting a return

48:20.800 --> 48:22.240
on the beer that I bought you.

48:22.240 --> 48:23.760
But if it doesn't come back, you're like,

48:23.760 --> 48:25.280
oh, well, another bad stock.

48:26.640 --> 48:28.000
I didn't choose well on that one.

48:28.000 --> 48:33.040
You go, you take your mug or pint glass, I guess,

48:33.040 --> 48:37.840
of beer up to the bar and you say, hi, I have this

48:38.400 --> 48:39.920
and I'm gonna be back later.

48:39.920 --> 48:43.120
Can you put a lid on it and put it behind the counter for me?

48:43.680 --> 48:47.280
And then I'll be back later to please save this for me

48:48.640 --> 48:50.960
and put a lid on it or something and I'll just come back.

48:50.960 --> 48:52.080
So it doesn't get stinky.

48:52.080 --> 48:55.120
So it doesn't get skunked and I'll come back later and drink it.

48:55.920 --> 49:00.640
Now, how does that help in getting a beer back to this old man?

49:00.640 --> 49:01.600
Yeah, that's the question.

49:01.600 --> 49:05.760
Do you, I feel like a round is such a selfless act.

49:05.760 --> 49:08.400
When you buy a round, if there's like 30 people in the bar,

49:08.400 --> 49:12.000
you're not expecting 29 other people to then do rounds.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.840
That would be a, that would take, first of all,

49:13.840 --> 49:15.440
that would take four and a half days

49:15.440 --> 49:17.120
and no one would survive it.

49:17.120 --> 49:18.000
That's so much.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.800
And no one says like drinks are on me and then you.

49:20.800 --> 49:22.320
And then you do it for me.

49:22.320 --> 49:25.200
It's not a fucking like massage circle that you're doing

49:25.760 --> 49:28.640
on opening night of your community theater production.

49:28.640 --> 49:30.320
It's, you know, it's a pub.

49:30.320 --> 49:31.680
It's a pub, it's a pub.

49:31.680 --> 49:34.400
I think that this is a very pay it forward kind of thing

49:34.400 --> 49:36.080
where like maybe next Christmas,

49:36.080 --> 49:39.520
you're at a bar parentheses pub in parentheses

49:39.520 --> 49:42.800
and you buy a round for a table and you say Merry Christmas

49:42.800 --> 49:46.400
and somewhere that old man feels the warmth in his heart.

49:46.400 --> 49:47.680
Oh no, it's a heart attack.

49:47.680 --> 49:50.320
I mean, the other thing here is you were about to leave

49:50.880 --> 49:54.400
and when the three of us used to go out to like,

49:54.400 --> 49:56.880
you know, bar things after shows

49:56.880 --> 50:00.160
and people would buy us drinks and shots,

50:00.160 --> 50:03.760
I had to get good at saying, I don't want that.

50:03.760 --> 50:07.040
I don't want, people would buy me a shot of like scotch

50:07.040 --> 50:10.240
or some shit and I'd be like, I do not want that.

50:10.240 --> 50:11.920
Put that, here's a shot of gin.

50:11.920 --> 50:13.280
I don't want to have that.

50:13.280 --> 50:14.960
So no, but thank you.

50:14.960 --> 50:16.000
Not even thank you.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.360
What were you thinking?

50:17.360 --> 50:19.120
Of course not, of course not.

50:19.120 --> 50:20.080
Must be tough.

50:20.080 --> 50:22.240
Yeah, no one's ever bought me anything in my life.

50:22.240 --> 50:24.880
Yeah, I've had to work and scrape for every inch.

50:25.840 --> 50:27.440
For every shot of scotch.

50:27.440 --> 50:29.600
I don't think they do shots of scotch, do they?

50:29.600 --> 50:30.960
I don't know much about alcohol.

50:33.040 --> 50:35.040
Here's a question, what did he want?

50:35.040 --> 50:37.440
What's this guy's angle?

50:39.440 --> 50:40.720
You think he's running for mayor.

50:43.680 --> 50:44.560
That's gotta be it.

50:44.560 --> 50:45.040
It's gotta be it.

50:45.040 --> 50:45.520
Probably that.

50:46.320 --> 50:47.840
I have a sort of unique thing here.

50:47.840 --> 50:49.840
Somebody sent in what I thought was Yahoo

50:49.840 --> 50:51.440
and I looked at it and I was like, oh, this is great.

50:51.440 --> 50:53.440
And then I realized it's actually a Reddit.

50:53.440 --> 50:54.000
Is it okay?

50:55.360 --> 50:55.680
Sure.

50:56.800 --> 50:58.560
It's pretty powerful.

50:58.560 --> 50:59.360
Become the monster.

50:59.360 --> 51:00.400
Let's become the monster.

51:01.120 --> 51:04.400
I think participating in Reddit is about as on the nose

51:05.280 --> 51:08.240
of becoming the monster as I can think of.

51:08.240 --> 51:11.360
This is from Desitroso.

51:11.360 --> 51:13.120
Actually, it was sent in by Michelle Smith.

51:13.120 --> 51:13.760
Thank you, Michelle.

51:14.320 --> 51:18.240
By Reddit user Desitroso or something like that.

51:18.240 --> 51:21.760
They ask, and this is in the guitar subreddit.

51:22.880 --> 51:26.400
I got Taco Bell in my guitar and IDK what to do.

51:26.400 --> 51:28.960
I got Taco Bell in my guitar and IDK what to do.

51:29.760 --> 51:31.920
I was eating Taco Bell nachos and like an idiot,

51:31.920 --> 51:33.920
I was eating them over my guitar.

51:33.920 --> 51:35.760
As I was going for a bite out of a chip,

51:35.760 --> 51:38.320
the beans fell and ended up right in my guitar saddle

51:38.320 --> 51:39.440
underneath the strings.

51:39.440 --> 51:41.200
While trying to get it out with a napkin,

51:41.200 --> 51:43.040
I just spread it around and screwed it up.

51:44.560 --> 51:46.080
How do I fix this and get it out?

51:46.080 --> 51:47.120
The brown stuff?

51:47.120 --> 51:49.680
It is, some of it is really deep in the saddle

51:49.680 --> 51:51.200
and I can't even see it anymore.

51:51.200 --> 51:53.600
Will it affect the guitar at all or attract bugs?

51:53.600 --> 51:57.040
Pulls help, I just wanted Taco Bell and this is my main guitar.

51:59.040 --> 52:05.040
The fear is not that you can't get the beans out of your guitar.

52:05.920 --> 52:08.400
The fear is that you play the guitar

52:09.040 --> 52:10.800
and you're better than you've ever been

52:11.600 --> 52:13.600
and then you become overly dependent

52:13.600 --> 52:14.960
on beans in your guitar.

52:14.960 --> 52:17.440
Oh, right, right, right.

52:17.440 --> 52:19.680
It's a rock and roll story, isn't it, of addiction?

52:19.680 --> 52:20.960
It's the tale of oldest time.

52:20.960 --> 52:22.800
Oldest rock and roll story there is.

52:22.800 --> 52:24.800
You get beans in the guitar.

52:24.800 --> 52:27.040
Give me the beans.

52:27.040 --> 52:29.600
I've already brought you so many beans to eat.

52:29.600 --> 52:30.640
I need more beans.

52:30.640 --> 52:31.680
I need more beans.

52:31.680 --> 52:35.200
That's why they call me Beanie Ray Vaughn

52:35.200 --> 52:37.680
because I love to put beans in there before I play.

52:37.680 --> 52:39.040
Jimmy Beandrix.

52:39.040 --> 52:42.240
Yeah, Jimmy Beandrix love to rub beans all over it.

52:42.240 --> 52:46.640
Hey, could you not, when you go to Taco Bell,

52:46.640 --> 52:49.040
I imagine you didn't have your guitar with you.

52:49.040 --> 52:50.640
This didn't happen at the restaurant.

52:50.640 --> 52:52.640
You brought the Taco Bell home,

52:52.640 --> 52:55.040
putting on a guitar while holding a Taco Bell.

52:55.040 --> 52:55.920
Like what was the chain?

52:55.920 --> 52:57.760
I cannot imagine a chain of events

52:57.760 --> 52:59.680
that would lead me to eating Taco Bell

52:59.680 --> 53:02.880
with my six strings strapped around my back.

53:02.880 --> 53:03.720
I can't-

53:03.720 --> 53:06.320
Okay, jam sash slash lunch down.

53:06.320 --> 53:07.840
I can't, you can't do both at once.

53:07.840 --> 53:09.200
First of all, the strings of a guitar

53:09.200 --> 53:12.000
after one minute of playing them become stinky

53:12.000 --> 53:13.760
and smell like robot armpits.

53:13.760 --> 53:17.760
So like I would not want that on my nacho sort of materials.

53:17.760 --> 53:19.840
It just seems like you shouldn't do both of these.

53:19.840 --> 53:22.160
And this is a punishment and it's never gonna come out.

53:22.160 --> 53:24.720
And people are gonna look at your guitar saddle

53:24.720 --> 53:26.880
and say like, hey, is that beans?

53:26.880 --> 53:28.480
And what a goofball.

53:28.480 --> 53:30.880
And you have to accept it that you are a goofball.

53:31.680 --> 53:32.560
There's no way you're gonna get

53:32.560 --> 53:33.600
these fucking beans out there.

53:33.600 --> 53:34.400
They're forever.

53:34.400 --> 53:35.920
These beans are gonna outlive you.

53:36.800 --> 53:40.560
Could you take it to like, I don't know,

53:40.560 --> 53:41.920
a pawn shop or something and tell them

53:41.920 --> 53:46.720
that this is a like, you know, a Van Hengen style

53:46.720 --> 53:51.280
you know, Van Halen bean variation version of this guitar

53:51.280 --> 53:55.840
because Van Halen always ate beans while they played

53:55.840 --> 53:58.640
and see if you can sell it for more money than it's worth

53:58.640 --> 53:59.920
and really con them.

53:59.920 --> 54:01.760
Yeah, pawn shop owners are so fucking stupid.

54:04.080 --> 54:06.160
You can get one over on So Easy.

54:06.160 --> 54:08.960
One time I took in a bunch of Nintendo 64 games

54:09.680 --> 54:11.200
and I said that they are Freddie Prinze Jr's

54:11.200 --> 54:12.880
and they gave me like a hundred bucks.

54:12.880 --> 54:13.380
Whoa.

54:13.380 --> 54:17.380
Oh, yeah.

54:18.260 --> 54:21.940
I mean, a hose, just blast it.

54:22.980 --> 54:25.220
Just blast it with a hose is one option

54:25.220 --> 54:26.100
that Griffin came up with.

54:27.460 --> 54:28.580
Soak it in a bathtub.

54:28.580 --> 54:30.340
What about a dirty toothbrush?

54:30.340 --> 54:32.100
It's good to keep an old toothbrush around

54:32.100 --> 54:33.860
because it's perfect to clean stuff like this up.

54:35.060 --> 54:35.380
Yeah.

54:35.380 --> 54:38.820
Use your dad's toothbrush to clean the beans out of your car.

54:38.820 --> 54:41.140
We almost always had a dirty toothbrush lying around

54:41.140 --> 54:42.740
that we could use to clean things with.

54:42.740 --> 54:44.820
And this was in the home we grew up in.

54:44.820 --> 54:47.060
Since then, I've never had an old toothbrush,

54:47.060 --> 54:48.100
an old dirty toothbrush,

54:48.100 --> 54:49.300
because I think the act of,

54:49.860 --> 54:51.780
there's an act of just defilement

54:51.780 --> 54:53.940
that you have to do to an active toothbrush

54:53.940 --> 54:55.780
in order to get a dirty cleaning toothbrush.

54:55.780 --> 54:56.100
Yes.

54:56.100 --> 54:58.020
And I've never been bold enough to pull the trigger on that.

54:58.020 --> 54:59.060
Nice thing about Quip.

54:59.060 --> 55:00.340
You're gonna have a lot of these lying around.

55:00.340 --> 55:02.100
Every three months, you're gonna get a new cleaning tool.

55:02.100 --> 55:03.140
It's not like you're getting a new brush.

55:03.140 --> 55:06.180
Hey, they didn't pay Justin enough about Quip.

55:06.180 --> 55:06.740
Fuck Quip.

55:11.140 --> 55:11.540
All right.

55:11.540 --> 55:14.260
We're gonna use a brand-ech toothbrush.

55:15.540 --> 55:17.380
So that's gonna do it for us here in our,

55:18.580 --> 55:20.260
maybe last episode of Collaborate Team,

55:20.260 --> 55:21.220
maybe first episode.

55:21.220 --> 55:22.820
Let's just call it first episode,

55:22.820 --> 55:24.180
because we have kicked off the year.

55:24.180 --> 55:26.100
Basically, I'm not gonna adhere to the calendar.

55:26.100 --> 55:27.780
It begins when we say it begins,

55:27.780 --> 55:28.980
and it has begun now.

55:30.580 --> 55:34.180
Frankenstein Team, become the monster.

55:34.180 --> 55:35.140
So welcome to that.

55:35.140 --> 55:37.860
I'm sure we'll have some merch at mcrorymerch.com

55:37.860 --> 55:40.660
coming up real soon for that to celebrate.

55:40.660 --> 55:42.500
Please don't put it on Redbubble.

55:42.500 --> 55:44.260
Just give us a fucking second, please.

55:44.260 --> 55:46.820
Give us a fucking second, please.

55:46.820 --> 55:48.980
One of us needs to go to lawyer school online.

55:49.540 --> 55:51.220
Hey, thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

55:51.220 --> 55:51.940
for these for our theme song.

55:51.940 --> 55:54.260
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

55:54.260 --> 55:55.140
It's a very good album.

55:55.140 --> 55:56.820
It's a very good song,

55:56.820 --> 55:58.340
and it's a powerful way to start out the show,

55:58.340 --> 56:00.020
and it gets me going every time I hear it.

56:01.300 --> 56:03.140
Go to mcrory.family.

56:03.140 --> 56:08.580
We're gonna be in New Orleans and Birmingham in February.

56:08.580 --> 56:10.660
You can get yourself some tickets.

56:10.660 --> 56:11.700
Come to those shows.

56:11.700 --> 56:12.660
Hang out with us.

56:14.020 --> 56:17.220
You can find links for that on our website,

56:17.780 --> 56:20.500
and come see us, and it'll be exciting.

56:20.500 --> 56:20.900
I'm excited.

56:20.900 --> 56:22.340
I've never been to New Orleans before.

56:22.900 --> 56:23.380
I'm excited.

56:24.100 --> 56:25.700
I mean, I've never been to Birmingham either,

56:25.700 --> 56:26.500
so I'm excited about that.

56:26.500 --> 56:30.020
So just go to mcrory.family, click on tours.

56:30.020 --> 56:31.460
Get yourself some tickets.

56:31.460 --> 56:33.300
That's God's country, Birmingham.

56:34.500 --> 56:35.540
And New Orleans.

56:35.540 --> 56:38.420
I mean, all of the earth is God's country.

56:38.420 --> 56:40.420
That's why he protects us from the aliens.

56:42.500 --> 56:43.060
What else?

56:43.060 --> 56:45.140
Thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

56:45.140 --> 56:46.260
Go to MaximumFun.org.

56:46.260 --> 56:47.460
Check out all the great shows there.

56:48.260 --> 56:51.140
Shows like the JV Club with Janet Varney,

56:51.140 --> 56:53.300
newcomer to the network,

56:53.300 --> 56:56.900
and shows like the Beef and Dairy Network,

56:56.900 --> 56:59.860
and Friendly Fire, and a bunch more at MaximumFun.org.

56:59.860 --> 57:00.660
Hey, quick plug.

57:01.220 --> 57:03.220
On the last Sawbones episode we did,

57:03.220 --> 57:05.620
we recorded it live at Cannon Knights in Huntington,

57:05.620 --> 57:10.260
and we've done some that's a Christmas to me bits on the show.

57:10.260 --> 57:14.820
And it is a full Hallmark film that Sydney and I wrote,

57:14.820 --> 57:18.260
and everybody in our family basically performed in it.

57:19.140 --> 57:20.020
So if you've-

57:20.020 --> 57:22.340
It's extremely, it is so fucking funny.

57:22.340 --> 57:23.140
It's really funny.

57:23.140 --> 57:24.020
You guys killed it.

57:24.020 --> 57:24.820
It is so good.

57:24.820 --> 57:25.460
Thank you, guys.

57:25.460 --> 57:25.860
Thank you.

57:26.660 --> 57:27.140
Let's wrap it up.

57:27.140 --> 57:28.180
Genuinely touched by that.

57:28.180 --> 57:28.580
Thank you.

57:29.620 --> 57:30.980
I don't feel like you're becoming monsters,

57:30.980 --> 57:31.860
but that's fine.

57:31.860 --> 57:32.660
We're not in it yet.

57:32.660 --> 57:32.900
Okay, so-

57:32.900 --> 57:34.180
We love monsters.

57:34.180 --> 57:34.660
Okay.

57:34.660 --> 57:36.420
So Merit Palmer sent this one in.

57:36.420 --> 57:36.900
Thank you, Merit.

57:36.900 --> 57:38.980
It's Yahoo Answers user Sasha who asks,

57:39.940 --> 57:43.140
I ate an old Lifesaver candy cherry flavor.

57:43.140 --> 57:45.300
Will I die from the oldness of the candy?

57:45.300 --> 57:45.780
Please help.

57:47.700 --> 57:49.380
My name is Justin McElroy.

57:49.380 --> 57:50.820
I'm Travis McElroy.

57:50.820 --> 57:51.700
I'm Griffin McElroy.

57:51.700 --> 57:52.660
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

57:52.660 --> 57:53.540
Kiss your dad.

57:53.540 --> 58:12.820
Let's go way around the lips.

58:12.820 --> 58:14.740
Maximumfun.org.

58:14.740 --> 58:15.780
Comedy and culture.

58:15.780 --> 58:16.900
Artist-owned.

58:16.900 --> 58:17.940
Listener-supported.

58:17.940 --> 58:24.020
We've all made mistakes in book club, right?

58:24.020 --> 58:25.540
You drink a little too much.

58:25.540 --> 58:26.820
You don't actually read the book.

58:27.620 --> 58:29.860
And if you're under the bubble in Fairhaven,

58:30.420 --> 58:33.380
your individual will get subsumed by the collective.

58:33.380 --> 58:36.740
Hey, maybe I just let him go and whip us up some guac.

58:36.740 --> 58:38.900
We do not require guac.

58:38.900 --> 58:41.860
We require only nutrients and expansion.

58:42.420 --> 58:44.580
You will become book club.

58:44.580 --> 58:47.140
You will eat, pray and love with us.

58:47.140 --> 58:48.580
Join book club.
