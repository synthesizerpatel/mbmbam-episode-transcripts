00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:18.000 --> 00:44.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
Welcome to my brother and my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era. Folks, it's cold and flu season.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
I hope you have your your vitamin C, your echinacea. What else? What else is your portable bubble?

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Your bubble that saves you from infection.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
I'm talking like a shower curtain kind of like force field thing.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Sure. So are you guys ganking ganking out?

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Excuse me.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Ganking is for your A, racism. Don't appreciate it.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Sorry.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
It's a isn't that for your memory?

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
It's for your memory, but that's how you remember to take all the other vitamins.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Remember not to get sick.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
Right. You know, people in Contagion, I, I liked Contagion.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
I liked how early Gwyneth Paltrow left the film, but I think.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Get out of here, Gwyneth.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
Hey, there's the door, lady.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Go cry on Blythe Danner's shoulder.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
I do wish that there had been a boy in a plastic bubble who had risen up to lead them.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Well, he would have been their hero.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
Hey, didn't Ewan McGregor do just that?

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
I guess in a way he just he did. It just didn't commit to it.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
That movie was startling for me on, on, well, three levels.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
The first being, oh, my God, this is how this is it, guys.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
This is it.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
This is how it happens.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
I hate to interrupt. I haven't seen Contagion.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
Okay, well, here, let me give you the, let me give you the elevator pitch.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Everyone gets real sick.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Okay.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Just real sick.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Have you ever been to a hospital?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Uh-huh.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
It's like it made the world into a hospital.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Yeah, pretty much it.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Okay, so the whole world smelled slightly of antiseptic.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Yeah.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
So that was part one.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
Part two is Ewan McGregor's head bubble is just so darling.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
He wears a head bubble like it's like a plastic bag.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
It's like you've never seen American Beauty.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
He wears that on his head.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
He wears that right on his head.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
It keeps him safe from disease.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
How many times in the movie do people ask each other if they've been taking their one a day?

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
That doesn't come up really.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
Yeah, it's apparently not effective in treating whatever contagion is.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
And the third point is that Ewan McGregor's got kind of a fucked up grill.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Well, how's your grill, Yuey?

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
I didn't know because was that movie magic or does he really have that fucked up a grill?

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
I think in every film he's ever made, it's been CGI'd out.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
It's pretty fucked up and it's only from one side.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
On one side, he looks like, you know, Obi-Wan.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
And on the other side, it's like, oh, no.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Oh, man.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
He looks like...

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Grody-Wan.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
I guess.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
I don't know.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
So this is our Ewan McGregor fan cast.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
I'm your older brother than my brother and me.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
I'm your baby brother, Griffin.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
And I apologize for how my voice sounds.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
I have the contagion.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Griffin has the contagion.

03:34.000 --> 03:42.000
And for people who haven't seen it, I hate to spoil it for you, but apparently the only thing that treats it?

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
More cowbell.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
I thought...

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
I was really surprised.

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
That was the only treatment, the only prescription that was available to people.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
And there was a run on cowbell stores?

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
I don't understand.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
But unfortunately, it wasn't covered by their insurance, so it was cost prohibitive.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Right, exactly.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
So people are, like, dying in the streets selling fake cowbell that are made of aluminum foil.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
This is a triangle.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Hey!

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
You need a horse bell, you fucker.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
This is one of those things with the little metal beads on it that you rub to make it sound like it's raining.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
A shrakka.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
A shrakka.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
Two of my female friends are moving into a new house, rent-free, because one of their parents owns it.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
It is a three-bedroom house, and they have invited me to live there with them.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
They are my best friends, and I spend most of my time with them.

04:28.000 --> 04:35.000
My concern is whether or not it's a good idea to live with two women with whom I have no romantic connection with,

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
because TV has taught me that doesn't always work out well from Gmail.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Zombie John Ritter.

04:41.000 --> 04:48.000
Just a reminder, if you're writing a gender-specific question like this, make sure to include your own gender,

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
because it can get kind of confusing.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
I'm thinking it's male.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
It is a male.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
I think you're right.

04:54.000 --> 05:01.000
I've managed to piece it together from context clues, but I had to devote brain cycles to that that I could have been using coming up with advice and wisdom.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Or a cure for contagion.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
I lived with a girl I was not romantically attached to for a month once.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
It was in an apartment.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
What?

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Travis did the same thing, didn't he?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
I did it for like three months, and it's not a good idea.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
I lived with a couple, and it was great.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Well, a couple is different.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
You're a secret third wheel.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Wait, are the girls a couple?

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
I don't think they are.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
I think they would have mentioned that.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
If they are, then yes.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Yes.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Live in there.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
You know what?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Here's the thing.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
I don't think it has any more complications than moving in with anyone.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
It's just different complications.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Explain, Travis.

05:41.000 --> 05:48.000
Well, you move with anyone you don't know or anyone you haven't lived with before, and you have a certain amount of, how's this going to go?

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
Maybe we're going to do things that is going to annoy each other.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Maybe we'll hate each other.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Well, they find it.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
Wherever I hit it, they find that thing that they can never find.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Exactly.

05:59.000 --> 06:12.000
And with moving in with female roommates, there's a certain amount of what tensions could possibly be created over a year that you're not expecting.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
You're talking about sexy stuff.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Yeah, sexy.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
And you've got to assume with two women, they're going to find it.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Wherever you hit that thing.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Where do you hide it?

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
Because it's not deep enough buried in the yard.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
You know that thing, they can never, ever find.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
They're going to find it.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
You get two girls together, they're going to go full scooby-doo.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
They don't even know what it is.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
They're going to scoop it up and just be all up in your shit.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
They're going to find it.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
You would have gotten away with it, too.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
That's the big worry.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Yeah, I think it could work.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
I think two would be easier than one, right?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Yeah, I think so, too.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Personally.

06:53.000 --> 06:59.000
You have to turn off that switch in your brain that tries to interpret things as flirting.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
You know that thing where it's like, oh, she just touched my shoulder, or she said I look really cute.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
Just turn that switch right off, and you are like a monk to them.

07:08.000 --> 07:16.000
You have no feelings towards them in any romantic way, and you have to set that up from the get-go.

07:16.000 --> 07:28.000
You do have to prepare yourself for some of the other unspoken things that come up when you're living with two women, vis-a-vis period stuff.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Yeah.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
No, please indulge me.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Well, they're just going to, you know.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Please, go on.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
They're just going to period, and when that happens, you've got to be prepared.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
And with two of them, they're going to sync up.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
They are going to sync, and when that happens.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
So really, you're saying you're going to live in a place for three weeks, a month, basically.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Yeah.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
You're going to live in a place for three weeks, take a week off.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
I am not entirely sure that I know what a period is.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
I'm in fact sure I don't.

08:02.000 --> 08:09.000
I think that if King of Queens has taught me anything, there's knives involved and a lot of growling.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
I think it's when you get.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
And a lot of snickerdoodles, I think.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
They just keep eating constantly.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
You get pregnant temporarily for four days, right?

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Basically, yes.

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
But with a ghost baby, and then it goes away, I think.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
That's where Casper came from, actually.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
That's where ghosts come from, all ghosts.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Wow.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
I have never been as uncomfortable in one second as I just was.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
It just washed over me like a wave.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
It's called the Justin flip.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
He flips it on you.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
I think you're going to be fine.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
And I think that, you know what?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Well, apart from all the period ghosts.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Except for that, you're going to be fine.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Hang some garlic up.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
That's key.

08:54.000 --> 09:01.000
The other thing is not knowing how a situation is going to work out is not a good reason to not do it.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
I completely agree.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Try it.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
I don't know.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Maybe it's awesome.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Embrace yourself for becoming one of the girls.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
It's just going to happen.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
You've got to deal with it.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Top model.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Yeah.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
And you know what?

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Let's be honest now in this enlightened age.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
That can be kind of awesome.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Yeah, sure.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
You know?

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Girls, they decorate better.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
The house always smells better.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Oh my God, yeah.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
You know?

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Most of the better TV is targeted at women.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Yeah.

09:25.000 --> 09:31.000
Every time I went over to a girl's house in college, I always thought, man, I wish my house was decorated like this.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Because it looks like an adult house.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
It looks like a nice place that people actually want to be.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
They always have juices and almond milk.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Yeah.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Sitting around super fruits.

09:40.000 --> 09:48.000
Just so I'm clear, Trav, before we get the emails and to make sure they get directed at the right person,

09:48.000 --> 09:54.000
you're saying that the nice thing about living with two women is that it's always clean.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Is that what you're saying?

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Wow.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
No.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
That there's always a hot meal on the table when you come home from the salt mines?

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
Can I say, because it's just a nicer place to be, a nicer environment,

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
a gentler environment?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
That makes sense.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Yeah.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
I'll let that slide.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
I don't think clean is right because I know some dirty girls, you know?

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Yeah.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
I know some messy-

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Girlfriend actually knows all the dirty girls.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
I know some messy ladies.

10:19.000 --> 10:25.000
And also, you got to think about how much of that apartment, the square footage, is going to be covered in ectoplasm.

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
You know, from the ghosts.

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
I think people knew what I was talking about when I said ectoplasm.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Do you remember? Do you remember what we were talking about like five minutes ago?

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
It was this whole goof.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
I want everyone to know that this whole episode for me is about period ghost stuff.

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
Good. So tune in. Go get the fam.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Gather around the radio.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
Go get Unky Dan around the radio.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Do you guys want a Yahoo answer?

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Yes, please.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Yeah, absolutely.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
How about this one?

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
This one is sent in by Jacob Locker.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Thank you, Jacob.

11:04.000 --> 11:11.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Terry Banto, who asks,

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
Audio chip embedded in adult diapers. Good idea?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
What?

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Wait, what?

11:17.000 --> 11:22.000
Do you have an elderly relative who needs to wear adult diapers and who is also somewhat impaired in their mental functioning?

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
My stepfather is 92 next month. He's been wearing them for a couple of years.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
He's also become rather negligent in terms of personal hygiene,

11:28.000 --> 11:35.000
and so I thought it would be a big advantage to know that his diaper, or as I call them, Mantees, is saturated. That's not okay.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Wow.

11:36.000 --> 11:43.000
How great would this be? A diaper with an audio chip, like some of those musical greeting cards that's triggered by a specific level of saturation.

11:43.000 --> 11:50.000
It can play tunes such as Moon River, Bridge Over Troubled Waters, or Rollin' on a River, even handles water music. You get the idea.

11:50.000 --> 11:56.000
Anyway, when a caregiver or relative hears the music playing, it's diaper change in time, and grandpa will not be able to argue over it.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
Anyone like this idea? Any venture capitalists?

11:59.000 --> 12:07.000
And then he goes on to say that this is an actual idea he's been kicking around for a while, and he's not just trolling.

12:07.000 --> 12:16.000
I think the music should be played at ear-splitting levels, but piped directly into the cerebral cortex of the elderly person,

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
so that it's blisteringly loud music that only they can hear,

12:20.000 --> 12:26.000
so that their own self-mess shame will be tied to a specific trigger.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Yeah.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
It'll be like a whole cerebral shutdown, basically.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
I think that this is a great idea for anyone who's ever sat around and thought,

12:36.000 --> 12:41.000
man, I'd really like to ruin the song Bridge Over Troubled Waters forever and ever for me.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Forever for me and everyone around me.

12:43.000 --> 12:48.000
Every time it comes on the radio, and you're the passenger in your car, it's like, oh, I love it, and you're like, no, turn it off.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Turn it off.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
This is the pee pants diaper song.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Here's the real question.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
The reason I wanted to read this question, because it's not typically the kind of question that we would get into,

12:57.000 --> 13:06.000
is what song do you want to come out of your pants whenever you pee in them?

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
I want this.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Whenever you urinate on yourself.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
I want whoop, whoop.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
That's the sound of the police.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
That's good.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
I think that would be awesome.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
And people, when they hear that, they'd be like, oh, you did it again.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
I think mine would be Don't Stop Me Now by Queen.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
That'd be good.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
Because some would be like, stop peeing, please, Scott.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
They listen to the tunes.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
I would go with Something in Red.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
That would really upset a lot of people, I think.

13:31.000 --> 13:43.000
I would really like Thunderstruck, but I want it to start out really quiet and slowly over the course of a minute,

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
fade up to a point where anybody can hear it.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
It's like at the beginning.

13:47.000 --> 13:53.000
So people would be sitting around watching TV with me, and I would have this big smirk on my face.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
And they would hear, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
And they'd be like, do I hear grandpa?

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
I love this, because now I want to change the mind to Rocky Like a Hurricane.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
And so it's just epic and triumphant.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
I want it to be big and proud, like everything else I do.

14:14.000 --> 14:21.000
If I'm pooping in my pants, I want it to be bright eyes so everybody else can enjoy my emotional state.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
That's where I'm at.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Hey, everybody, come on down here with me.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
I'm pooping my pants.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
How about Anything by Puddle of Mud?

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
No, sir.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
No, sir.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
I do not like it.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Something they like.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
What kind of music do old people like?

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Something with 23 Skidoo in it.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Something with Glenn Miller.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
He seems to be very popular with the old people.

14:46.000 --> 14:56.000
I think that if I dropped a totally ferocious deuce in my pants as a grownup adult man,

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
and Hoobastank started playing, I feel like people would be angrier about the Hoobastank.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
What if it was just like Tubthumper?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
What?

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Tubthumper by Chumbawumba.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
You mean Tubthumping?

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Yeah.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
Tubthumper is their ballad.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
I like Tubdub.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Tubbed again.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Isn't that nice?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Classic.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
I have a question here.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Yeah?

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Don't you get a questioner?

15:23.000 --> 15:30.000
Well, the person writing this Yahoo Answers question says it's their, what, father-in-law?

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Yeah.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Stepfather?

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Stepfather.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
And the stepfather is 92?

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
92 next month.

15:36.000 --> 15:42.000
So even at like a lowest point estimation, the person asking this question is like 50-something.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Oh, he's a grownass man.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
I'm looking at his picture in the profile.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
He wants this tech to be in place.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
He is a grownass man who's, I would guess, between the ages of 50 and 60, who's like,

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
this is a totally great idea.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Yeah.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
I'm thinking that this guy just got his very first musical birthday card, and he's like,

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
you know what would be great is if that only played if I peed on it.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
Oh wait, diapers, moon river.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
But he also uses the word mantis.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Yeah.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
I have a pretty good detection system.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
If you walk into a room and it smells like the urine of the elderly, maybe change your

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
dad's diaper.

16:19.000 --> 16:24.000
If your house so smells like the urine of the elderly that you can no longer detect

16:24.000 --> 16:30.000
a fresh cloud of that, a fresh system, a high-pressure elderly urine system moving into your living

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
room, maybe you should move.

16:32.000 --> 16:40.000
But what he is saying is he wants music to come out of his steppapa's loins so that

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
his steppapa can't say, not my piss.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
I'm going to take this idea and tweak it slightly.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Okay.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
Have you ever seen those cards where you can record your own message in them?

16:51.000 --> 16:57.000
So you tricked your stepdad into saying, I just pissed my pants.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Yeah.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
And so then when it plays, like, well, you admitted it.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Yeah.

17:02.000 --> 17:07.000
And I heard it come from your pants mouth.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
I think it might be time to put old dad out to pasture.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Put him on the ice floe.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
It's time to put him on the ice floe.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
He's had a good run.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
That's not fun.

17:20.000 --> 17:27.000
You know, Eskimos have 86 words for snow and no words for singing underpants.

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
I don't think you should put your pop peepums out on the ice floe.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
He's a revered elder in the community.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
His pants sing when he poops them.

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
Oh, Christ.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
What are we doing to the elderly?

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
Can't they just poop in their pants?

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
This is the greatest generation.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
If they can poop in their pants in quiet.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
They can poop in their pants.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
Your step peepums was in World War II.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
His pants don't deserve to play Mambo No. 5 when he makes pees in them.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
Your peepaw pooped in Hitler's pants.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
And now you want him.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Come on.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
Oh, that's the perfect song.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
When Johnny Combs is watching Home Again.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
Oh, fuck.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Poor old people.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
They're trying.

18:19.000 --> 18:24.000
Hey, I'm a guy who's been happily dating my girlfriend for a little over four years.

18:24.000 --> 18:30.000
I work with a girl who started calling me pumpkin in a borderline flirty way.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
To make things worse, that's a nickname my girlfriend has for me.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
To make matters worse, I'm a pumpkin.

18:37.000 --> 18:44.000
The girl I work with is cute and we are friends, but I have no interest in her, obviously.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
But I am afraid she's going to do it in front of my girlfriend.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
Put it on my Facebook wall or something like that.

18:50.000 --> 18:56.000
How do I gently ask her to stop doing that without sounding whipped or mean?

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
And that is from the not so great pumpkin.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
I have an opinion.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
Here is how you stop her from doing that.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
You do not.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Now, bear with me.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
She's not hurting anything right now.

19:12.000 --> 19:20.000
You have to respect that if it's a situation where it could be bad, it could be, you know, embarrassing for her to call you that.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
She will not call you that.

19:22.000 --> 19:28.000
There's nothing wrong with her calling you pumpkin at work just because you have a girlfriend who happens to also really enjoy squash.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
Just roll with it.

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
And maybe do like a preemptive thing and say to your girlfriend, like, there's this girl at work.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
She won't stop calling me pumpkin.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
It makes me kind of uncomfortable.

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
And then if it ever happens in front of your girlfriend, you can just look at your girlfriend and go, hey, hey.

19:44.000 --> 19:50.000
And this just in your significant other be a boy or girl being a little bit jealous.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
Not the worst thing in the world can have its benefits.

19:54.000 --> 20:02.000
Is it possible that this girl that you work with is calling you pumpkin in a non flirtatious way?

20:02.000 --> 20:09.000
Maybe are you extremely fat and jaundiced?

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Is that a possibility?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Be honest with me.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Are you fat and jaundiced?

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
Because if so, she might just be calling you pumpkin in a descriptive way.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Maybe it's a mean nickname.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Hey, pumpkin.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
Maybe your girlfriend's calling you that in a mean way, too, and you just never picked up on it.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
She's slimmed down.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
It used to be her little spaghetti squash.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
Yeah, fix your keypens.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Here's the thing.

20:35.000 --> 20:44.000
I don't think there's any way to say it to this girl at work that doesn't sound mean because, like Justin said, she's not hurting anything.

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
And two, what if she comes back and goes, I call everyone pumpkin.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
And now you just look like a dick.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
I don't know anyone's name.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Hey, pumpkin.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
Listen, bitch.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Yeah, that's how you'll sound.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Don't do that.

20:59.000 --> 21:10.000
Yeah, because she's doing something that's nice and, you know, in her mind, probably just a friendly, you know, jokingly flirting kind of thing, and you're going to come back at her and make her feel like a jerk.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
Yeah, and if you do that, here is every interaction we're going to have with her again.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Here are those clothes you asked for.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
Kyle.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
Yeah, I don't think there's anything wrong with it.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Just let it go.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Let it fly.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
All right, isn't it nice?

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
And plus, if she was really flirting with you, she wouldn't be calling you pumpkin.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Like, that's not how girl flirting works.

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
It's not that overt and just really smacking you upside the face with it.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
That's probably the way she interacts with everyone.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Let me ask you guys something.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
It is good to get called a pet name by a stranger.

21:42.000 --> 21:53.000
Now listen, if you go to a bank, if I go to a bank and I make a deposit in the bank and the bank tailor, like, calls me sweetie or something like that, that just makes me feel nice.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
You're walking on sunshine.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I am walking on sunshine and clouds and rainbows.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
Day is made.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Man, I love that.

21:58.000 --> 22:03.000
When I go to, like, a restaurant, the waitress is like, and what are you having, darling?

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
And I'm like, oh, I would like some hash browns, please.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
I'm disarmed.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
I think everybody should start calling everyone by nicknames all the time.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Okay.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Especially police officers.

22:15.000 --> 22:22.000
Well, hey, baby.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
No, wait, are we talking to the police officer or are they talking to us?

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
I think it's funnier if you are talking to the police officer.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Hey, baby.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Do you know why I pulled you over?

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
No, baby, why?

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
No, baby, baby.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
Hey, baby, baby, baby, tell me what's up.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
What'd I do?

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Hey, girl.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Did I do something naughty, sweet girl?

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
Oh, sweet girl, I'm so sorry, baby.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Let me see that ticket.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Was Daddy speeding?

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Did Daddy sign that ticket, girl?

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Let me give you an autograph, baby.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Sir, I'm a 50-year-old man.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
Hey, pumpkin, get me a sugar, sugar.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Give me that ticket.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Come on, little lady.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Let me see that ticket.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Let me just blot my lipstick with that.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
Come here.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
I'm being mad.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
I'm being squeezed.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Come here, baby.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
I'm blotted.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Let me get that.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Put that pepper spray down, sugar.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Sugar?

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Come on.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Don't you tase me.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Hey, sugar.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Don't tase me, sugar.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Hey, baby sugar.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
I don't want to go to jail.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Hey, open that door.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Go ahead, open.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Stop my head.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Take these cuffs off, girl.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
You're...

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Oh.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Oh.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Oh, you're tasing me now.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
You are beating me, sweetness.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
I'm being tased.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Oh, this is electric.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Do you feel this between us, baby, baby?

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
I am on the ground convulsing, sugar.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
Oh, girl, I just threw up on the ground a little bit.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Come on, baby.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Oh, baby, look at my throw up.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Uh-oh.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
I know you got a wet nap, girl.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Come on.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Come on, give me that wet nap.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
People are starting to stare.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
People are staring at me.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
I'm pissing my pants literally as you watch.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Me flail about.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
Come on, girl.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
How many more charges you got in that thing?

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Damn.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Damn.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I bet I got a charge for you.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
A little electric kiss.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Come here, let me kiss you.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
A little police brutality, girl.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Oh, yeah.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
I got some brutality for you.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
I tell you what.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
I need some you-tality.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
Come here.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
I need some of that.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Oh, I'm in the car.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
You shot me.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
You shot me in the...

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
I'm dying.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
I'm dying.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
I'm dying.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Damn, girl.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
You got me dying on the ground right now.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
Look at all that blood, girl.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Oh, girl, I'm bleeding out.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Girl, it's getting hot.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
I'm dying, girl.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Damn, girl.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
Oh, my extremities are so cold, girl.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Girl, I can't feel my fingertips, girl.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
This ain't right.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Come here.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Why don't you blow on them a little bit?

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Come warm me on them.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Tell my mama I love her, girl.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
Damn, girl.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Damn.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
I want you to meet my mama, girl.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Damn.

24:45.000 --> 24:51.000
By the way, I literally want you to carry my remains to my mama for a nice service.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Damn.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
God, those pants look good on you, girl.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Damn.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
I think we just sexually harassed the internet.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
I'm in heaven.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Damn, St. Peter.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
You looking good, girl.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Damn.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Tune in next week.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
Tune in next week when not a girl cop.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Why is that?

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
I feel bad for the police officer.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
He just shoot a man in cold blood, didn't he?

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Yeah, for speeding.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
For speeding.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
He was violently sexually harassing him.

25:23.000 --> 25:29.000
He was provoked, honestly.

25:29.000 --> 25:46.000
The funerals are so expensive, so I think that... No, let's just get the money done.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Oh, a special one.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
This is a tender moment right now.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
Okay.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
So everybody just chill out for a second.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
Travis, I'm going to give the honors to you, Travis.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Well, thank you very much.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
This is from Alex to his girlfriend, Mitchell.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Happy late birthday.

26:04.000 --> 26:09.000
Your birthday was September 29th, and we missed it.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
That was our bad.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
We fucked up.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
That's on us.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Yeah, we ruined it.

26:13.000 --> 26:18.000
Alex put this in for your birthday and stuff, and we blew it.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
So happy late birthday.

26:20.000 --> 26:29.000
Right now, we're giving Alex time to... Well, Alex, go ahead and grab a... You know.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
And so just real quick, one more thing.

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
Alex wants to know, will you marry him?

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
What?

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
What?

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
She never saw this coming.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Look, she's crying.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
I'm crying, and now she's running away.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Uh-oh.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Come back.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Damn.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Wait, girl.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Come on.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Hey, girl.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Hey, girl.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
No, this is a... I shouldn't try to... I shouldn't turn this into a bit.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
This is the most magical moment of their lives.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
They're kissing.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
They're smooching.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
So I'm going to assume that she has said yes.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Look at them.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
Now, look.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
She said yes.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
They're so touched.

27:07.000 --> 27:12.000
Look, they're buying... They're buying My Brother, My Brother and Me T-shirts from MaxFunStore.com.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Oh, they're exchanging them.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
Oh, it's so sweet.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
They bought each other...

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
It's better than rings.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
It's better than rings.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
It's better than rings.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
It's better than rings.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
It's better than rings.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
It's better than rings.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
It's better than rings.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
It's better than rings.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Congratulations to you guys.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
We hope your blessed day was all the more blessed.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.680
Oh, and now when you wear your T-shirt, and people say, do you listen to My Brother, My

27:29.680 --> 27:30.680
Brother and Me?

27:30.680 --> 27:32.920
And you could say, I do.

27:32.920 --> 27:34.480
I love it.

27:34.480 --> 27:35.480
Thanks, you guys.

27:35.480 --> 27:36.480
Congratulations.

27:36.480 --> 27:37.480
Sorry we were late.

27:37.480 --> 27:39.640
We totally... we postponed your engagement.

27:39.640 --> 27:40.480
That's the power.

27:40.480 --> 27:43.440
That's the kind of power we wield.

27:43.440 --> 27:44.440
Oh, man.

27:44.440 --> 27:45.440
I'm drunk on it.

27:45.440 --> 27:47.040
But, congratulations, you two.

27:47.040 --> 27:50.600
love you very much. I love you. I love you more than they do.

27:50.600 --> 27:55.280
Guys, go ahead, Griffin, what were you saying? I was just thinking maybe a Yahoo would be

27:55.280 --> 27:58.240
appropriate to come off of that sweet, sweet wedding moment.

27:58.240 --> 28:04.320
I love it. I love this plan. By which I mean, let me pick the most inappropriate

28:04.320 --> 28:08.320
one I have in my quiver. Just pull one out, knock it.

28:08.320 --> 28:14.720
This one was sent in by Johnny Wags, but he said that he found it thanks to his friend

28:14.720 --> 28:19.520
neverlikethat. Those are both Twitter handles. Okay.

28:19.520 --> 28:24.200
I hope those aren't given names. It's Yahoo Answers user Pistocker who wants

28:24.200 --> 28:33.200
to know, how can I overcome my fear of Bruce Willis?

28:33.200 --> 28:38.400
I have an acute phobia of Bruce Willis. Every time I see him on the television screen, I

28:38.400 --> 28:43.640
become nauseated and clammy. My skin crawls, and I feel like I will die soon thereafter.

28:43.640 --> 28:48.960
How can I get over this? Now, what I love about that question is there

28:48.960 --> 28:54.080
are three different things I can think of, that either his fear of Bruce Willis is that

28:54.080 --> 29:02.880
he's afraid Bruce Willis is going to come get him, or two, there is nothing he's afraid

29:02.880 --> 29:09.600
of in particular, just Bruce Willis in general puts him on edge, or three, he's afraid of

29:09.600 --> 29:14.400
what Bruce Willis might become. Of what he represents, you mean?

29:14.400 --> 29:18.120
Yeah. He's like, I was such a huge fan of him in Die Hard, but I don't know what's

29:18.120 --> 29:22.360
going on now, and I'm afraid. You don't know what his next career move is

29:22.360 --> 29:23.360
going to be. Exactly.

29:23.360 --> 29:25.060
Is that what you mean? He's shifty.

29:25.060 --> 29:28.560
He is transformative. He's like Clayface.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.880
Or Clay Aiken. Or Clay Aiken.

29:30.880 --> 29:36.180
You never know what he's going to do next. He's mutable. I feel what you're saying.

29:36.180 --> 29:44.640
He is going to make a Dwayne The Rock Johnson jump into comedy soon, and I'm worried about

29:44.640 --> 29:47.480
it too. Yeah. Well, he already started. What was the

29:47.480 --> 29:50.880
one with Tracy Morgan? Cop Buddies?

29:50.880 --> 29:55.560
Cop Friends. Cop Friends? Cop Friends in 3D?

29:55.560 --> 30:02.640
Soon he'll be able to take, he'll get into that classic Harrison Ford Clint Eastwood

30:02.640 --> 30:07.080
phase of the action hero's life when he's like, everyone regards him as the biggest

30:07.080 --> 30:12.680
badass in town, but he rarely moves at more than four or five miles per hour. He's like

30:12.680 --> 30:17.320
a really scary tank without guns and a nice hat.

30:17.320 --> 30:21.080
Yeah. Oh, don't cross him. People say back in the

30:21.080 --> 30:24.920
mid-70s he killed 30 kids. He will glare at you and just make you feel

30:24.920 --> 30:29.120
real bad. I remember seeing pictures of him attempting

30:29.120 --> 30:37.760
to keep a civil relationship with Ashton Kutcher as he fully knew that Kutcher was just slobbin'

30:37.760 --> 30:42.160
all over his wife. Thanks for that, by the way, paparazzo.

30:42.160 --> 30:48.340
Much obliged. That picture of Bruce is one of the most intense

30:48.340 --> 30:53.040
faces I've ever seen on a human being before, and if it's that image, I am also terrified

30:53.040 --> 30:57.480
because now to me he's back on the prowl. Sure.

30:57.480 --> 31:01.120
What if I- Can we get those two back together?

31:01.120 --> 31:07.520
What if I run into her at Central Market and we both drop our groceries and while I'm

31:07.520 --> 31:11.680
helping her pick up her groceries, Bruce Willis fucking garrotes me.

31:11.680 --> 31:17.280
No, I think he's totally cool with you, Griffin. Yeah, that's pretty cool.

31:17.280 --> 31:22.120
Totally cool. I think it's great, Ashto.

31:22.120 --> 31:31.800
I'm saying he is Demi's private Batman. Oh. He's not the husband she needs.

31:31.800 --> 31:37.520
He's the husband that will choke out any man who ever looks at her.

31:37.520 --> 31:41.280
I don't understand why you're drawing these conclusions about Bruce's relationship with

31:41.280 --> 31:43.480
Demi's complex. Have you met Bruce Willis?

31:43.480 --> 31:47.920
I have not. Have you? Okay. I haven't either, so doesn't it make

31:47.920 --> 31:55.240
more sense that he would be incredibly just unnaturally violent?

31:55.240 --> 32:01.360
I actually think that I bet that Bruce Willis in real life is- The best parallel I can draw

32:01.360 --> 32:07.600
is a dad whose daughter has just brought in her first homecoming date, and so he's being

32:07.600 --> 32:15.040
very smiley and civil, but it's a thin veneer over just troubled waters. He will kill you

32:15.040 --> 32:18.320
as soon as your daughter leaves the room. He pulls you close and goes, now you know

32:18.320 --> 32:20.960
that's my special girl. Hey.

32:20.960 --> 32:25.800
I'm going to go ahead and say Bruce Willis has definitely killed a man before.

32:25.800 --> 32:29.280
You think? I think he's almost certainly killed a man.

32:29.280 --> 32:35.320
You know what I think the problem here is? I think the problem is that I am only familiar

32:35.320 --> 32:42.920
with Bruce Willis through his music, so the problem is, of course, that you guys know

32:42.920 --> 32:47.560
Bruce Willis, I know Bruno from The Return of Bruno.

32:47.560 --> 32:53.600
Oh, fuck. You understand? I see him as a musician and

32:53.600 --> 33:00.960
a provocateur, I guess. I mean, a singer, songwriter, and performer.

33:00.960 --> 33:03.000
Poet. Poet, really.

33:03.000 --> 33:07.880
And I think that that's where this disconnect is coming from, because I only know his music.

33:07.880 --> 33:10.920
Let's- So you've seen the softer side of Bruce.

33:10.920 --> 33:13.120
I've seen the softer side of Bruce, yeah. Exactly.

33:13.120 --> 33:20.120
Let's get to the heart of it, though. What can we do to get over this fear, this

33:20.120 --> 33:23.840
Bruce-ophobia? Is it possible that we could start selling

33:23.840 --> 33:29.440
amulets to ward him away? Yeah, these are Bruce-proof.

33:29.440 --> 33:33.480
Can you make an amulet out of good career choices? Because he seems pretty averse to

33:33.480 --> 33:37.480
those. I think we're big proponents of immersion

33:37.480 --> 33:41.360
therapy. Is there a movie where you can watch Bruce

33:41.360 --> 33:43.560
Willis not be intimidated? Because I don't think that-

33:43.560 --> 33:50.880
Hudson Hawk. Hudson Hawk's a good one, Daddy Daycare.

33:50.880 --> 33:55.120
I don't think he's intimidated. You may have confused him with Eddie Murphy,

33:55.120 --> 34:02.080
which I totally, totally understand, because of Eddie Murphy's prolific action career,

34:02.080 --> 34:09.400
Pluto Nash. I do not think Bruce Willis is Eddie Daycare.

34:09.400 --> 34:14.920
I recommend watching that to all my patients. Have you ever seen Cop Buddies?

34:14.920 --> 34:18.480
You may or may not be intimidated in that. I tell you what, I wasn't intimidated by

34:18.480 --> 34:23.400
him in Die Hard 4. It was basically just him looking at helicopters

34:23.400 --> 34:28.280
for two hours. It's not that bad.

34:28.280 --> 34:34.080
Have you seen Crazy Cops? Wacky Cops. Wacky Cop Buddies.

34:34.080 --> 34:38.400
Which one was Wacky Cops? I get Wacky Cops and Cop Buddies confused.

34:38.400 --> 34:42.480
Wacky Cops was the one with the 15-minute-long chase scene where he was just on the hood

34:42.480 --> 34:47.180
of the car saying, slow down, over and over again for 15 minutes.

34:47.180 --> 34:53.280
What was the one where he's a cop with a heart of gold, but also one of the scary movie

34:53.280 --> 34:58.600
brothers is in it? Oh, yeah. What's that one, Griff?

34:58.600 --> 35:00.680
That one is- Last Boy Scout.

35:00.680 --> 35:06.440
Last Boy Scout. There it is. Have you seen To Protect and Chuckle?

35:06.440 --> 35:08.720
I don't- You Just Got Served.

35:08.720 --> 35:14.000
You Just Got Served is one that is very popular. It's him and Gerard Depardieu hit one of

35:14.000 --> 35:18.840
them from across the Atlantic trying to get his green card. They fall in love.

35:18.840 --> 35:27.280
Isn't he in Rush Hour? He was in Russia when he tore down that cold

35:27.280 --> 35:30.760
wall. Mr. Willis.

35:30.760 --> 35:33.040
Mr. Willis? Tear down this wall.

35:33.040 --> 35:39.360
Help me tear down this wall with scary movie Gerard Depardieu. This is the weirdest film

35:39.360 --> 35:46.040
promotional event we've ever done, but let's tear down this wall. The wall I'm talking

35:46.040 --> 35:51.600
about is in Russia, basically. Can you find Bruce Willis and have a candid

35:51.600 --> 35:57.120
discussion with him about your fear of him? Separated by bulletproof glasses.

35:57.120 --> 36:00.120
No, no, no. I want you to really get in there and say,

36:00.120 --> 36:05.600
hey, Bruce, I want you to know this has nothing to do with your career. I think you're a fine

36:05.600 --> 36:14.840
actor, a fine thespian, but I am fucking terrified of you. What can I do to get over that?

36:14.840 --> 36:19.440
Have you ever seen Last Man Standing? No.

36:19.440 --> 36:25.360
It's a Bruce Willis movie where he's basically a gangster cowboy. Basically, the movie is

36:25.360 --> 36:34.080
a solid two hours of him shooting dudes constantly. What are you suggesting with this, Travis?

36:34.080 --> 36:36.720
Nothing. I just really love that movie. Fuck you.

36:36.720 --> 36:42.440
You're not even helping anymore. No, I'm saying if you watch that movie, it's

36:42.440 --> 36:45.720
good. It's a good movie to watch. Wait, hold on.

36:45.720 --> 36:50.280
You know what, guys? I just watched What Dreams May Come on Netflix Instant Q the other day.

36:50.280 --> 36:56.400
What a just sterling film. Bruce isn't in it. It's Robin Williams, but nevertheless,

36:56.400 --> 37:00.760
this is movie talk. I'm just saying it's much better than surrogates.

37:00.760 --> 37:06.400
I'm saying you're a jerk. Agreed or disagreed?

37:06.400 --> 37:12.080
I actually don't think the two are mutually exclusive. I think you could dislike surrogates

37:12.080 --> 37:17.160
and hate Travis all at the same time. Did you guys watch Top Shot last night?

37:17.160 --> 37:23.760
Did you guys watch Top Chef? They used the music of Bruce Willis the entire episode.

37:23.760 --> 37:28.680
It really highlighted it. Hey, I used to think setting my phone to vibrate

37:28.680 --> 37:34.560
was much less annoying than having an obnoxious ringtone going off all the time. However,

37:34.560 --> 37:38.960
seems like with newer phones, the vibrating is just as loud or louder. Heaven forbid your

37:38.960 --> 37:42.660
phone is sitting on a coffee table and it vibrates.

37:42.660 --> 37:49.320
So I've come to you to ask, which is worse? A moderately loud ringtone that you have to

37:49.320 --> 37:53.480
hear all the time or having it sound like there's a sex toy in your pocket every time

37:53.480 --> 37:57.400
you get a message. That's from Grant and Granger.

37:57.400 --> 38:07.240
I would like to throw out what I have been doing lately, which is if I am in a group

38:07.240 --> 38:11.400
of people, say we were going out to dinner, hanging out at a bar after a shower or something,

38:11.400 --> 38:15.280
I turn my phone off. Wait, you don't mean power it down.

38:15.280 --> 38:19.960
Yeah, I turn it straight off. Do you know why? Tell me.

38:19.960 --> 38:23.880
Well, I'm of the belief, and I was actually just listening to an episode of Stuff You

38:23.880 --> 38:27.840
Should Know, for instance, Stuff You Should Know, and they talked about the future of

38:27.840 --> 38:34.960
the internet. One of the things they talked about is that smartphones are literally reprogramming

38:34.960 --> 38:40.160
our brains to think differently. So those conversations of who was that guy in that

38:40.160 --> 38:46.240
thing with that girl, those conversations are disappearing because now everybody just

38:46.240 --> 38:52.160
takes a second and looks it up on their smartphone. So I turn off my phone so that I can continue

38:52.160 --> 38:56.720
to have those conversations about who is that guy? What was that movie? Do you remember

38:56.720 --> 38:57.880
that thing?

38:57.880 --> 39:03.040
You are a proponent of returning to the caveman days where you couldn't remember the name

39:03.040 --> 39:09.280
of the movie? Only in social situations. Like if I'm by myself, my phone is on all the

39:09.280 --> 39:12.840
time and it's my outreach to the world.

39:12.840 --> 39:15.560
But it sounds like you're a Luddite though.

39:15.560 --> 39:18.880
Well, one of the things they said on this episode that I really agree with is if you

39:18.880 --> 39:21.960
wouldn't pull out a crossword puzzle and start doing it, you shouldn't pull out your

39:21.960 --> 39:27.000
phone and start tapping away. I think that it is rude in a social situation.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.160
One of the guys from Stuff You Should Know gets a judgmental.

39:29.160 --> 39:34.920
I know, right? But I think that, man, just turn your phone off. If you're in a situation

39:34.920 --> 39:38.600
where you worry about the sound bothering people, like if you're in a movie or at a

39:38.600 --> 39:43.940
play or at dinner or something, just turn it off. You'll be fine for two hours.

39:43.940 --> 39:45.720
I don't agree.

39:45.720 --> 39:48.640
Unless your whole family dies in a house fire.

39:48.640 --> 39:52.720
Yeah, right. Unless someone needs to ask you a question about the My Brother and Me episode.

39:52.720 --> 39:55.880
For hundreds and hundreds of years, we lived in worlds without cell phones.

39:55.880 --> 40:00.400
But we also didn't- the three of us couldn't have hosted a podcast then. We have new technology

40:00.400 --> 40:05.320
demands and I need your attention 24 hours a day. What if I need to ask you a question

40:05.320 --> 40:08.480
about our technology show that we have?

40:08.480 --> 40:09.480
We have a technology-

40:09.480 --> 40:10.480
This is a tech cast.

40:10.480 --> 40:16.640
This is a tech and movie cast. Now what I'm saying is, like, okay, I'm trying to express

40:16.640 --> 40:19.840
this to you in a way that you'll understand because you are a Luddite. You've revealed

40:19.840 --> 40:23.640
yourself. You love bacon and you hate technology. What I'm saying to you is-

40:23.640 --> 40:25.600
I don't hate technology. I fear it.

40:25.600 --> 40:32.360
There are facets of this technology that have changed our daily life so much that we need

40:32.360 --> 40:34.040
the technology to navigate them.

40:34.040 --> 40:35.040
Or we'll die.

40:35.040 --> 40:37.840
Which I mean. We have a show on the internet, right?

40:37.840 --> 40:38.840
Uh-huh.

40:38.840 --> 40:44.740
You can't have a show on the internet and also say, like, phones are rude because I

40:44.740 --> 40:49.760
didn't need to talk to you all the time before we had a show on the internet. So, like, the

40:49.760 --> 40:54.080
technology has perpetuated the need for itself. You can't just put the genie back in the bottle,

40:54.080 --> 40:56.200
I guess is what I'm saying.

40:56.200 --> 41:00.480
All I'm saying is moderation is always the best way to go. I'm not saying get rid of

41:00.480 --> 41:03.800
cell phones. I'm just saying maybe you don't need to have one, like, surgically attached

41:03.800 --> 41:05.720
to your hand all the time.

41:05.720 --> 41:12.880
I am cutting the rope right now while you guys are having this conversation because

41:12.880 --> 41:18.160
I got bored by it and I instinctively reached into my pocket and got my cell phone out and

41:18.160 --> 41:21.840
I said, oh, there are some ropes that need to get cut and cut the rope. And so I started

41:21.840 --> 41:22.840
cutting ropes.

41:22.840 --> 41:25.600
I thought you were playing cut the rope. You're not cutting the rope from your cell phone.

41:25.600 --> 41:26.600
I thought you were cutting the tether.

41:26.600 --> 41:27.600
No, no, no.

41:27.600 --> 41:28.600
Cutting the cord.

41:28.600 --> 41:37.520
No, no. If I could put more ropes onto it. I think it's phenomenal that there is a thing

41:37.520 --> 41:43.960
that I have in my hand that 30 years ago, it would be the size of a small library.

41:43.960 --> 41:48.200
And it also, from to someone 30 years ago, would seem like one of the tricorders from

41:48.200 --> 41:49.200
Star Trek.

41:49.200 --> 41:54.640
Goddamn, it's a fucking, it's a motherfucking lightsaber.

41:54.640 --> 41:55.640
My eyes.

41:55.640 --> 41:56.640
Right, it has a lightsaber in it.

41:56.640 --> 42:02.360
I am a tech wizard. I can't shake the feeling that I'm a tech wizard. I'm a steampunk.

42:02.360 --> 42:04.520
I have to have it in my hands at all times.

42:04.520 --> 42:08.320
On a completely different note, just make sure that your ringtone isn't the same song

42:08.320 --> 42:10.200
that plays when grandpa pees his pants.

42:10.200 --> 42:11.200
Oh, yeah.

42:11.200 --> 42:12.200
Or else it gets really confusing.

42:12.200 --> 42:17.520
Or maybe do. Maybe that would be a fun goof. Like, grandpa, I do it too.

42:17.520 --> 42:21.160
Just kidding. Oh, there I go again on my own.

42:21.160 --> 42:26.360
Just kidding. This is a young girl that I'm gonna go have a good time with. And you rub

42:26.360 --> 42:28.400
that in his face.

42:28.400 --> 42:35.800
We're gonna go find Glenn Miller and spit on him. I think that Travis actually has a

42:35.800 --> 42:41.000
point that if it's in a situation where it's gonna be bad, I say go ahead and turn it off.

42:41.000 --> 42:45.280
Think of all the internet you'll have waiting for you stored up for when you finally do

42:45.280 --> 42:46.280
turn it back on.

42:46.280 --> 42:50.080
Especially, and I can't stress this enough just because I'm in theater, if you go to

42:50.080 --> 42:52.160
a theater event, turn off your phone.

42:52.160 --> 42:54.260
Turn off your goddamn cell phone.

42:54.260 --> 42:58.480
It ruins it for everybody. Because there's always that one dude who doesn't do it and

42:58.480 --> 43:02.920
right in the middle of a really emotional scene, it starts playing some CeeLo Green

43:02.920 --> 43:06.480
and everybody's looking around and you've ruined it for everybody. And you're just

43:06.480 --> 43:07.480
a turd.

43:07.480 --> 43:09.840
Don't ruin the play. Come on.

43:09.840 --> 43:16.000
I feel like every theater in the country should adopt the rules of the Alamo Drafthouse here

43:16.000 --> 43:21.160
in Austin where if your phone goes off or you talk at all, they kick you out and then

43:21.160 --> 43:25.920
they shoot you in the mouth in the street with a gun, which I think is a little excessive.

43:25.920 --> 43:30.360
Yeah, it's a little much. Hey, I've come to you in some need of some sage advice.

43:30.360 --> 43:34.040
I got out of a five-year-long relationship nearly a year ago and have recently started

43:34.040 --> 43:36.380
dating again. Good for you.

43:36.380 --> 43:39.920
The woman I'm seeing now is great. We have a wonderful time together whenever we go out.

43:39.920 --> 43:43.960
So the issue isn't really with the relationship itself. It's when she's on the phone with

43:43.960 --> 43:48.760
me. When we're on the phone, a conversation usually runs upward of an hour before she

43:48.760 --> 43:53.800
feels like she's ready to hang up. And I'm not always in the mood for such extended conversations.

43:53.800 --> 43:57.960
So tell me brothers, is there a way I can get across to her that I don't always feel

43:57.960 --> 44:01.020
like talking on the phone without hurting her feelings or making it seem like I'm making

44:01.020 --> 44:06.720
excuses not to connect? Silent in St. Louis. Oh God, I'm having like a little, I'm having

44:06.720 --> 44:12.920
a panic attack thinking about talking on the phone for an hour. Like I'm, I'm, I'm physically,

44:12.920 --> 44:17.320
I don't know if it's still this way with you guys, but I know that for a while, like the

44:17.320 --> 44:24.320
three of us are incapable of talking on the cell phone, on any phone. I'm so bad at it.

44:24.980 --> 44:30.200
With my ADD, if it goes longer than like 10 seconds, I'm staring at so many other things

44:30.200 --> 44:34.800
and I'm out. I'm gone. I've turned on the TV and I'm, I'm watching SpongeBob. Well, you

44:34.800 --> 44:41.080
also have raging ADD. Like, yeah, I know that's what I'm saying. Like I'm out. I'm impressed

44:41.080 --> 44:44.560
we've managed to keep your attention for this hour. I've been playing fetch with my cat

44:44.560 --> 44:51.560
the whole time. I like that honesty. Yeah, man. Like I hate the phone. My wife knows she'll

44:51.560 --> 44:55.760
call me. Sit'll call like on her way home from work or whatever, just to let me know

44:55.760 --> 45:02.760
she's, she's coming and I'll instantly like, I'll just be quiet. Like I won't talk. And

45:02.880 --> 45:07.080
she'll say, you, you want to wait till I get home, don't you? And I was like, yeah, I do.

45:07.080 --> 45:11.240
I don't want to talk on the phone anymore, please. And when she gets home, like we'll

45:11.240 --> 45:15.160
talk, like I love talking to her and I'll talk as much as she wants to. I, I, I, and

45:15.160 --> 45:20.560
we'll have long conversations. It's the, it's the phone. I can't talk into it. I hate, and

45:20.560 --> 45:24.520
I used to, and I didn't used to be this way. Cause I can remember being in high school

45:24.520 --> 45:28.320
and being on the phone for long periods of time. Well, when I was in high school and

45:28.320 --> 45:32.160
I was, cause I remember doing the same thing and I hated every single second of it, but

45:32.160 --> 45:35.720
I did it because that's what I thought I was supposed to do. But then you get a car and

45:35.720 --> 45:41.000
then you learn how to drive and you can just go to that person. And so now like I established

45:41.000 --> 45:45.680
with Teresa very early on. I was like, listen, I don't like the phone. I'm not good at it,

45:45.680 --> 45:51.620
but I love text messaging and I love long conversations. So if we can meet like somewhere

45:51.620 --> 45:56.280
in the middle and do both of those two things in, you know, either talk in person or just

45:56.280 --> 46:02.320
text message me one question and let me answer it. That's great. Cause in my life, that's

46:02.320 --> 46:06.480
usually what it is. It's like, what are you doing tonight? I'm doing this. Great.

46:06.480 --> 46:09.880
Talking on the phone is like sitting in a room with a person and talking to them. Only

46:09.880 --> 46:12.880
you're not allowed to touch them and your eyes are closed.

46:12.880 --> 46:14.880
Who wants to do that?

46:14.880 --> 46:19.880
It's like a scene out of saw. It's like a challenge. I hate it.

46:19.880 --> 46:23.560
It is a challenge because there's so many things going on right in the periphery. What

46:23.560 --> 46:27.440
are you not doing that you could be doing? I don't know. For me talking to someone is

46:27.440 --> 46:32.360
a full, and this is part of it. I like to get in there. I like to get into that psyche.

46:32.360 --> 46:37.320
I like to look in the eyes. I like some occasional touching of the shoulder. I like to get in

46:37.320 --> 46:38.320
there.

46:38.320 --> 46:39.320
I grabbed the head.

46:39.320 --> 46:40.320
It is intense.

46:40.320 --> 46:41.320
I grabbed the head with both hands.

46:41.320 --> 46:42.320
I said, Hey, look at me.

46:42.320 --> 46:43.320
Look at me.

46:43.320 --> 46:44.800
Basically it's like a Vulcan mind melt kind of thing.

46:44.800 --> 46:48.440
Look at me. Did you watch Totshot last night?

46:48.440 --> 46:53.480
And here's, so here's my, here's my advice. I think you need to tell her that because

46:53.480 --> 46:57.440
what's going to happen and what may already be happening is like you see her call and

46:57.440 --> 47:01.660
you think, man, I do not have the time or patience for an hour long conversation right

47:01.660 --> 47:07.040
now and you don't answer the phone and like that's already planted a bad seed right there.

47:07.040 --> 47:08.400
Shine comes off the apple.

47:08.400 --> 47:13.180
Yeah. So I think that you need to say like, listen, I think you're great. I really love

47:13.180 --> 47:17.760
talking to you, but if you know, why don't we just hang out instead of talking on the

47:17.760 --> 47:22.280
phone or you know, let's save all this up because what you don't want to do is get to

47:22.280 --> 47:26.440
a point where when you hang out in person, you have nothing to talk about because of

47:26.440 --> 47:28.360
your marathon phone conversation.

47:28.360 --> 47:29.880
Yeah. You use it all up.

47:29.880 --> 47:33.320
Yeah. And then be like, so what did you do today? And it's like, well, it's nine o'clock.

47:33.320 --> 47:36.120
So I woke up and that was it.

47:36.120 --> 47:40.080
That was it. I, you know what? I realized sitting here thinking about it while you talked

47:40.080 --> 47:45.500
about whatever it was you're talking about. I, I don't like casual conversations in any

47:45.500 --> 47:51.280
respect. If I see someone, I'll sit down and talk with somebody, but if I see someone that

47:51.280 --> 47:57.840
I know in a public setting, I consider it a loss. If I stop, I like exactly as much

47:57.840 --> 48:04.840
time as I can talk. I've actually caught myself walking in slow motion so I don't lose, like

48:04.840 --> 48:10.200
once I've lost momentum, I've committed myself to a casual conversation. I can't stand it.

48:10.200 --> 48:15.440
See, I always say I, I, I'm terrible at small talk and I'm really great at big talk. Like

48:15.440 --> 48:16.440
I'm great at epic.

48:16.440 --> 48:18.480
Hey, what are you guys going to use about life and stuff?

48:18.480 --> 48:23.600
Yeah, like that, I can carry on that conversation for six hours, but if someone's like, how's

48:23.600 --> 48:28.720
work? How's, how's Teresa doing? I have nothing. I'm like, she's great. It's, it's going fine.

48:28.720 --> 48:34.680
Do you guys ever get, you guys ever get into a conversation with a, a, a casual conversation

48:34.680 --> 48:38.200
in public with, with someone maybe you don't know them that well or you don't see them

48:38.200 --> 48:43.040
that often. They'll go through the whole conversation and they'll ask you these questions being

48:43.040 --> 48:47.280
polite and then you'll end the conversation and you'll realize about 30 seconds later,

48:47.280 --> 48:53.840
like, man, I didn't ask them anything. What a monster I am. Like I, I will do that to

48:53.840 --> 48:58.240
a higher extent where I'll realize I never made eye contact with them once. I did. Yeah.

48:58.240 --> 49:03.640
I did not look at them. I was bad at that one. That one was on me. That's, that's a

49:03.640 --> 49:08.200
loss. We're going to put that in the L column. Do you guys think that we might be sociopaths?

49:08.200 --> 49:12.960
Possibly. We got a touch of it. No, I mean, I'm not saying like we're Bruce Willis level,

49:12.960 --> 49:18.840
but we're, we're so, maybe a little bit. Man, what a bastard that guy is. He's terrifying,

49:18.840 --> 49:25.080
frankly. Um, Griffin. Yeah. How about it? You want a Yahoo? You know I do. Well, I've

49:25.080 --> 49:29.920
got five. Jesus Christ. Just read them all back to back to back. Yeah. Just cram it in.

49:29.920 --> 49:38.920
Yeah, I'll do that. No, don't do that. Um. No, this one's gross. All right, it's, this

49:38.920 --> 49:42.760
one was sent in by Josh Becker. Thank you, Josh. It's by Yahoo. And it's user Seth Wolf

49:42.760 --> 49:49.680
who asks, how can I get my friend to kick me? Hi, I have a foot fetish. Okay. And I

49:49.680 --> 49:53.320
kind of like my friend's feet. We are good friends. And if he kicks me while he is in

49:53.320 --> 49:57.000
this action, I plan to grab his foot, take his shoe off in a playful, friendly way. Like

49:57.000 --> 50:01.000
saying you can't kick me now because I have your shoes. Then he will say something like,

50:01.000 --> 50:06.520
well, I don't need shoes to kick. And then I take off and then I take off and then I

50:06.520 --> 50:10.480
take off his socks and I'll be closer. So I need to know how I, to get my friend to

50:10.480 --> 50:15.880
kick me by saying something to make him playfully kick me or something to get me to see and

50:15.880 --> 50:19.520
touch his feet without him thinking I have a foot fetish. So what do you think? I can

50:19.520 --> 50:24.840
either get him to kick me, but not be mad or take, or me to touch his feet and take

50:24.840 --> 50:31.240
off his socks. I really want to take off his socks, but just touch his feet. So any ideas,

50:31.240 --> 50:37.720
but please no mean or useless ideas, please. Can everyone for a week stop raping their

50:37.720 --> 50:44.920
friends, please? Can we just stop like tricking people into fucking them? Like, and this is

50:44.920 --> 50:50.320
what this is. This person is tricking their friend into raping their feet and I'm done.

50:50.320 --> 50:56.760
I can't do it. That's for them, for in the, in the lens of their perversion. That's what

50:56.760 --> 51:02.160
they're doing and they're killing me. The problem with this kind of question is it makes

51:02.160 --> 51:08.380
me go, which of my friends really like my feet? Is this about me? Who is this person

51:08.380 --> 51:12.680
that I know that once they touch my feet, it changes your whole perception. It's like

51:12.680 --> 51:17.920
when you were in the matrix, like everything changes after this. These are all mean and

51:17.920 --> 51:22.820
useless ideas, guys. How can we get this guy back before the internet? This kind of person

51:22.820 --> 51:26.240
would have just been that lonely person down at the end of the block that everyone would

51:26.240 --> 51:30.600
be like, Oh, Oh, don't worry about old Mr. Jenkins, but no one would have known that

51:30.600 --> 51:34.720
his real thing was he wanted to rape his friends. We are going to sit down in this room, 12

51:34.720 --> 51:38.520
angry men style, and we are not going to get up until we figure out a way for this man

51:38.520 --> 51:45.040
to kiss his friend's naked feet. You try to convince me to help this gentleman. I, the,

51:45.040 --> 51:50.760
the, the, the adjournment is in session. I am sitting here and I'm not going to help

51:50.760 --> 51:58.680
this fucker unless you convince me that I need to. What if he just did it? No. Now Travis,

51:58.680 --> 52:04.120
you're- Give me that foot. Just did it. You're like the Judd Hirsch juror who flips right

52:04.120 --> 52:09.200
away. Like you just gave in. I'm staying strong. I'm not helping this weird beard. And I know

52:09.200 --> 52:13.080
this isn't like the furries thing where I got mad at them for no reason. This guy is

52:13.080 --> 52:18.400
being aggressive and I don't like that. I don't care if you're a foot fetishist who

52:18.400 --> 52:24.560
has a willing partner. This is not good. This is assault is what this is. This is assault.

52:24.560 --> 52:31.440
Can you rub him? You can't rub his foot. Without permission. No, I mean, hey, you, you could

52:31.440 --> 52:37.600
get permission. Who doesn't like a good foot rub? Me. Well, me too. Yeah. I like a good

52:37.600 --> 52:45.840
foot rub. From your buddy? From my friends. Hey buddy. One joke. I got a good way to trick

52:45.840 --> 52:50.720
your friend into kicking him. Tell him you'd secretly like to steal his socks and rub his

52:50.720 --> 52:56.560
feet and put it in your mouth. That's a pretty good kick trigger, I think. This whole scenario

52:56.560 --> 53:02.720
seems so unlikely. I doubt your friend would say anything like, I don't need shoes to kick.

53:02.720 --> 53:07.960
What about socks? That's not a good singer. You don't hear Spider-Man say that after his

53:07.960 --> 53:12.480
shoes have been stolen. Maybe tell him you want to play shoeless Chuck Norris. I have

53:12.480 --> 53:18.080
this theory. We've had a few questions like this, and I think that we have probably, no,

53:18.080 --> 53:26.960
I mean, I like the show in this genre of like people talking about specific situations that

53:26.960 --> 53:32.680
they'd like to get into. And like, like the skull one is another, is another example.

53:32.680 --> 53:38.960
I think that there are people who, for whom have a fetish, but you know, it, it only,

53:38.960 --> 53:46.000
this is how it manifests. But by typing in this specific scenario into a public forum,

53:46.000 --> 53:50.120
they are living it out rather than looking for actual advice on how to do this. So you're

53:50.120 --> 53:55.120
saying if this person listened to our podcast, it would be like a double, double jizzaroo

53:55.120 --> 54:00.800
for them. So you're saying like they're writing like erotic fan fiction, and we are reading

54:00.800 --> 54:08.400
it out loud. I am slam-poeting this person's erotic fan fiction. Can I just say, now that

54:08.400 --> 54:15.200
I said that out loud, I really like the idea of writing like erotic fan fiction about yourself.

54:15.200 --> 54:21.720
Like this is a Travis story by Travis. This is Travis and Harry Potter. I write slash

54:21.720 --> 54:26.920
Vic, but it's always me slash someone. Me. I tried me slash me for a while, but that

54:26.920 --> 54:34.320
was really depressing. It was really sad. Me and Metroid. One day Justin and King of

54:34.320 --> 54:39.840
Queens were at the ice cream store. I love pie, said King of Queens. So do I, said Justin.

54:39.840 --> 54:50.560
And then they blasted each other in the butts. Sex was had by all. Oh man. Great sex, King

54:50.560 --> 54:56.560
of Queens. That's also my favorite Aesop's fable. Here's, here's the moral, here's the

54:56.560 --> 55:04.920
moral of the story. Neither a borrower nor a lender be. Oh fuck. I want to hear Griffin's

55:04.920 --> 55:09.680
last question, but first few housekeeping things. This is of course my brother, my brother,

55:09.680 --> 55:17.480
me. You listen again, so I blame you. I appreciate so much everyone taking the time to tweet

55:17.480 --> 55:21.120
about the show with the my brother, my brother, my brother, my brother, my brother, my brother.

55:21.120 --> 55:26.440
Tons of people on Friday tweeted about the, tweeted out our sampler link. We gave one

55:26.440 --> 55:35.400
of them an FF as they say, a follow Friday to our buddy Brian Minsker. So next Friday

55:35.400 --> 55:43.400
do that again. Tweet the link to our show. It's bit.ly forward slash it's M-B-M-B-A-M.

55:43.400 --> 55:47.360
And Justin, may I say real quick, just because I don't think we've talked about it yet.

55:47.360 --> 55:52.160
I really enjoy Losing the Sheen. Yeah. Well what's Losing the Sheen? Losing the Sheen

55:52.160 --> 55:57.280
is a podcast about two and a half men by two people who have never watched two and a half

55:57.280 --> 56:02.080
men till after Charlie Sheen left. And it's starring our very own Justin McElroy and

56:02.080 --> 56:06.520
his wonderful wife, Sydney McElroy. If you haven't checked it out yet, go to iTunes

56:06.520 --> 56:11.280
and search Losing the Sheen. It's hilarious. Thanks. And yes, Garvin Wright and review.

56:11.280 --> 56:19.040
I appreciate that. The whole bit. People tweeting about Kimbo 2042, jam collie. Who else? Who's

56:19.040 --> 56:28.640
been tweeting about our show this week? Joanna 11. Joanna 11. LGW Green. Anybody else? I

56:28.640 --> 56:34.760
stayed off the grid this week, mostly. Jeff Paulson. You're not feeling good. That's understandable.

56:34.760 --> 56:40.560
Duck Lips 5 for 13, obviously, always. Super Side Guy. James' Wife. Sean MD. Cheesecake

56:40.560 --> 56:46.240
Jones. Austin Man Morico. Always. So many awesome people tweeting about the show. It

56:46.240 --> 56:51.440
makes me really happy. And I would like to personally thank all the people who encouraged

56:51.440 --> 56:57.640
me through Endless Shrimp 2011. I couldn't have done it without your support. Hey, guys.

56:57.640 --> 57:02.120
I look forward to Endless Shrimp 2012. You realize we need three people to do this show,

57:02.120 --> 57:08.320
right? It's funny to watch Travis hurt himself with shellfish, but if he dies from it, the

57:08.320 --> 57:14.080
show's pretty much done. Yeah, it'll pretty much be the end of the show. So stop being

57:14.080 --> 57:21.400
so shellfish. I want to thank Bob Ball for doing our introductory warning, and I want

57:21.400 --> 57:25.000
to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters for the use of their song, It's a Departure

57:25.000 --> 57:29.880
Off the Album, Putting the Days to Bed, which every week, I could get more people saying,

57:29.880 --> 57:32.640
like, oh, I'm listening to The Long Winters now. They're fucking great. Yeah, they are

57:32.640 --> 57:37.000
fucking great. Guys, I told you that. Pay attention. We've been telling you that for

57:37.000 --> 57:41.520
how long now? For forever. Just go listen to The Long Winters. You're going to love

57:41.520 --> 57:49.120
them. They're the best band. Actually, if you go to eMusic, our buddy Tracy Wilson found

57:49.120 --> 57:54.520
that on eMusic, that album, Putting the Days to Bed, or no, no, I'm sorry, The Long Winters

57:54.520 --> 57:58.560
Going to Pretend to Fall is five dollars. Five whole dollars, guys. Go buy it. Five

57:58.560 --> 58:01.840
whole dollars. Go get it. That's not the one with It's a Departure, our theme song, but

58:01.840 --> 58:08.880
it's so good. It's still worth it. Jesus Christ. Okay, so that's our show. Thanks for listening

58:08.880 --> 58:18.400
again. I love you. I love you, Griffin. This final question was sent in by Jacob Locker

58:18.400 --> 58:28.120
as well. Thank you, Jacob. It's by Yahoo Answers user Gishal, who asks, are there Juggalo animals?

58:28.120 --> 58:32.320
I'm Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy. This has been my brother,

58:32.320 --> 58:50.280
me. Kiss your dad. Squirt on the lips.
