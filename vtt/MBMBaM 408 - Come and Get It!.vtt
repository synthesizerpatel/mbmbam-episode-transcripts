00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.840 --> 00:46.720
Hello everybody and welcome, my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the

00:46.720 --> 00:52.000
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I am your middlest brother, Travis

00:52.640 --> 00:57.520
McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

00:57.520 --> 01:01.520
Well, it's time to take my brother, my brother, me to the next level.

01:02.800 --> 01:08.240
Are we getting married to like cereal or something?

01:08.240 --> 01:10.160
Are we getting a fourth brother finally?

01:10.160 --> 01:13.680
No, no fourth brother. Travis, I told you the budget just isn't there.

01:15.440 --> 01:20.640
We could CGI the fourth brother. It would be like Travis, but I don't know,

01:20.640 --> 01:25.440
red hair? No, I have red hair now. Travis, but made of gold.

01:25.440 --> 01:29.680
I have finished the Steve Martin masterclass in comedy.

01:29.680 --> 01:32.320
I can't fucking believe we're talking about this again.

01:32.320 --> 01:40.080
I am ready to, here is my kind of thing. I have absorbed the entirety of the masterclass.

01:40.800 --> 01:49.680
It comes at a retail value of $90. I will impose my knowledge to you for half that amount.

01:49.680 --> 01:50.320
Us?

01:50.320 --> 01:55.040
Yes. Well, we could start with you guys and then we could just take this show on the road.

01:55.040 --> 02:01.120
Now, you all should probably charge one fourth as much as I, the math isn't clean.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.400
Wait, hold on.

02:02.400 --> 02:07.360
2250, I think. And you charge half as much as you paid me because you are giving this

02:07.360 --> 02:11.280
information away third hand at this point. And charge other people, and then how much

02:11.280 --> 02:13.360
of that money do you have to kick back up to Steve?

02:13.360 --> 02:18.960
It's not a big deal. It's just like 10% of everything I earn goes back to, oh.

02:19.760 --> 02:20.720
Yeah, Justin.

02:20.720 --> 02:25.760
Yeah, I see. I see what he wrote me into. Let's just get a dry run at it though.

02:25.760 --> 02:30.960
I'm here. I'm ready to answer your comedy questions from you two. Whatever.

02:32.800 --> 02:36.400
I want to hear your sincere queries about comedy.

02:36.400 --> 02:37.040
I got a great one.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.000
I'm ready to help.

02:38.000 --> 02:38.960
Let's say you're part of a-

02:38.960 --> 02:40.560
Hold on. Can you raise your hand for me?

02:42.080 --> 02:42.800
Yeah, I'm doing it.

02:43.440 --> 02:44.240
Griffin?

02:44.240 --> 02:46.320
Yeah, I wasn't doing it. Eat my nards.

02:46.320 --> 02:46.820
Got him.

02:46.820 --> 02:56.580
So, Steve Junior, Steve TA, say I was part of a comedy outfit, a long-term project that's

02:56.580 --> 03:03.780
been running for eight years or so. And then there was this recurring bit that the other

03:03.780 --> 03:09.940
people in the outfit were really enthusiastic about, but I wasn't. One, what is the right

03:09.940 --> 03:16.420
way to tell them we really shouldn't do that bit again? And number two, if they still want

03:16.420 --> 03:21.540
to just sort of break on through to the other side of comedy, which is tragedy or at the

03:21.540 --> 03:28.820
very least boredom, is it okay to walk away and find new outfit? What do you think about

03:28.820 --> 03:30.180
that, Mr. Steve Junior?

03:31.220 --> 03:35.780
Interesting, huh? Gosh, you really stopped me midway through eating my banana.

03:37.140 --> 03:40.740
That's the funniest fruit, so I'll give you that one, Steve Junior. You got it good.

03:40.740 --> 03:47.860
Here's what I do in your scenario. What I do is I call Marty Short and I say, is this

03:47.860 --> 03:48.360
funny?

03:48.980 --> 03:52.260
Hold on, that's what Steve would do or that's what Steve Junior would do?

03:52.260 --> 03:55.620
This is what Steve told me to do, guys. I don't actually know.

03:55.620 --> 03:56.180
Okay.

03:56.180 --> 04:00.980
I don't actually know, I don't even know Martin Short's phone number, but he just says,

04:00.980 --> 04:04.100
call Marty Short and ask him if it's funny.

04:04.100 --> 04:09.380
Yeah, yeah. And he would say if it was like this, for instance, this bit, this intro,

04:09.380 --> 04:14.180
he would say, and that patented Marty Short voice, he'd be like, no, you know?

04:14.180 --> 04:18.020
Do we have any other questions? What about you, bearded fellow?

04:18.020 --> 04:19.460
Yeah, it's Travis.

04:20.020 --> 04:21.300
Oh, great, Travis.

04:21.300 --> 04:24.020
I mean, I paid for the course, you could learn my name.

04:24.580 --> 04:26.580
Sure, can you raise your hand real quick?

04:26.580 --> 04:27.380
It is raised.

04:27.380 --> 04:27.940
Oh, it's raised.

04:27.940 --> 04:28.740
Up your butt.

04:29.620 --> 04:34.020
Okay, this is good too. You guys are already, you should be the teachers.

04:34.020 --> 04:42.180
I guess my question is, when it comes to like working blue, how blue is too blue?

04:42.180 --> 04:50.500
You know, PC culture is so different than it was when I was starting in the 70s doing my thing.

04:51.380 --> 04:54.500
And some people are into the PC thing and some people aren't.

04:54.500 --> 04:59.460
One thing that everybody can agree on though is banjo music.

04:59.460 --> 05:00.180
Oh.

05:00.180 --> 05:04.420
So you should do more of that.

05:04.420 --> 05:07.460
That can't possibly have been in the lessons, Justin.

05:07.460 --> 05:10.500
Just more banjo music and if you're stuck, call Marty Short.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.180
It was about a three minute long video.

05:13.140 --> 05:17.780
So the whole class, the whole class is just a three minute long video of him playing banjo

05:18.340 --> 05:22.420
and trying to convince you to call Marty Short and ask him if it's funny.

05:22.420 --> 05:29.140
Is it funny to pay $90 for a course and then give them two weeks worth of free advertising?

05:29.140 --> 05:33.380
It's un-fucking-believe. I am beyond belief.

05:34.100 --> 05:38.980
Okay, well, I mean, I was just trying to, here's the way I kind of figured it.

05:38.980 --> 05:42.500
It's like, if I managed to turn it into something funny,

05:43.460 --> 05:48.500
then one, I feel like it's a business expense at that point that I have recouped.

05:48.500 --> 05:48.980
Yeah.

05:48.980 --> 05:53.780
And two, then Steve knows that his time was well spent

05:53.780 --> 05:56.260
because something really funny came out of it from me.

05:56.260 --> 06:00.820
His stew, his bride's pupil, Justin, wild and crazy guy, McElroy.

06:00.820 --> 06:04.180
Right, but neither of those things happened is the only problem.

06:04.180 --> 06:09.060
Okay, negative feedback is something that's going to come to everybody in their career.

06:09.060 --> 06:12.900
But one thing that everybody loves is this fucking banjo and calling Marty Short.

06:14.260 --> 06:18.740
I'm like, we get it. I get it. I gotta eat. I got it. I do have it.

06:18.740 --> 06:21.860
You gave it, you gave it, you gave it to me and I have it now.

06:21.860 --> 06:29.620
Let's say that you have to do a speech at the MoMA for a Tom Hanks ceremony honoring him.

06:29.620 --> 06:32.180
Oh, I love this because I actually do have to do that.

06:32.180 --> 06:34.420
Good. So what you're going to want to start with is like,

06:34.420 --> 06:38.660
what things do you know about Tom personally?

06:38.660 --> 06:42.340
Not the stuff that people read in the papers, but like your own interactions with him.

06:42.340 --> 06:43.300
Soft hands.

06:44.020 --> 06:45.380
Soft hands. That's good.

06:45.380 --> 06:48.580
Softer than you think, but not as soft as you'd hope.

06:48.580 --> 06:50.740
Okay, good. See, that's funny already.

06:50.740 --> 06:52.820
Soft hands, hard dick.

06:53.700 --> 06:56.100
Yep. If there's one thing I know, it's soft hands.

06:56.100 --> 06:59.140
But if there's two things I know, it's hard dick.

06:59.140 --> 07:02.020
Uh, little fella back there, you didn't raise your hand.

07:02.020 --> 07:06.100
I love that you want to contribute and you're excited about being part of the class.

07:06.100 --> 07:07.220
I do need to see that hands.

07:07.220 --> 07:10.580
Yeah, no, come back. Here's my hand, Stephen. You talked about getting nasty.

07:10.580 --> 07:13.940
Let's get nasty. I want you to talk about fucking Tom Hanks throbbing thong.

07:14.500 --> 07:17.460
I want to hear you talk about that right now in your own voice.

07:17.460 --> 07:19.220
Talk about his throbbing thong.

07:19.220 --> 07:25.060
Well, PC culture has come a long way since the 60s when I was a writer on the Smothers Brothers.

07:25.060 --> 07:29.620
And we used to just take that envelope and push it right out the window.

07:30.340 --> 07:33.860
Sure. And the banjo, too, would come in there somewhere.

07:34.900 --> 07:38.180
So this is my Brother by Brother video. It's an advice show for the modern era.

07:38.180 --> 07:40.900
We take your questions and turn them alchemy-like into wisdom.

07:40.900 --> 07:45.060
And now, for the first time in 408 episodes,

07:45.060 --> 07:48.580
this one's going to be funny because I know what I'm doing.

07:48.580 --> 07:49.140
Yeah, sure.

07:49.140 --> 07:50.020
Good, good, good.

07:50.020 --> 07:53.460
I work in an art museum and people are always asking me about my art.

07:53.460 --> 07:56.100
The problem is I'm not an art student. I just work there.

07:56.100 --> 07:59.540
I have blue hair and I'm standing there looking at art. So I get it.

07:59.540 --> 08:04.260
But it's always awkward when they find out I'm actually a law student.

08:04.260 --> 08:05.780
And often they don't believe me.

08:05.780 --> 08:09.380
They usually make an awkward comment about the way I look to justify the assumption.

08:09.380 --> 08:12.340
What can I say to make the whole thing less weird?

08:12.340 --> 08:13.620
That's from Deceptive in DC.

08:14.180 --> 08:18.340
Law is just a kind of art, the art of the deal.

08:18.340 --> 08:20.020
Yeah, it's so subjective.

08:20.020 --> 08:20.660
Thank you.

08:20.660 --> 08:21.540
Yeah, the art.

08:22.420 --> 08:24.500
Prior art, that's a law thing.

08:24.500 --> 08:25.540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:25.540 --> 08:31.700
I would give any amount of money to routinely be set up with the line,

08:31.700 --> 08:33.380
tell me about your art.

08:34.020 --> 08:36.260
So I could say, oh, my art?

08:36.260 --> 08:40.820
And then, I don't know, maybe play the spoons or like lift up my shirt

08:40.820 --> 08:45.460
and I've painted a painting on my belly or, you know, just various things.

08:45.460 --> 08:48.740
I feel like there's so many good punchlines you could deliver.

08:48.740 --> 08:49.380
That's good.

08:50.100 --> 08:52.580
Art doesn't just have to be paint on paper.

08:52.580 --> 08:52.900
Exactly.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.020
Art can be anything.

08:54.020 --> 08:55.460
So they say, tell me about your art.

08:55.460 --> 08:57.700
And you pull out a little, you know, a foosball.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.060
And you're like, I'm a master on that table.

08:59.060 --> 09:00.020
Let me show you.

09:00.020 --> 09:03.860
And you throw it as hard as you can across the room because you don't have a table.

09:03.860 --> 09:06.180
But I think it'll still get the point across.

09:07.140 --> 09:08.580
Yeah, and you do it.

09:08.580 --> 09:09.940
You kind of flick it across the room.

09:09.940 --> 09:10.420
And what's that?

09:10.420 --> 09:14.100
Oh, it pops right into the mouth of that guy that's screaming in that one painting.

09:14.100 --> 09:15.540
And you're like, go.

09:15.540 --> 09:16.180
Yeah, go.

09:16.180 --> 09:18.580
You punch a big hole in the screaming painting.

09:18.580 --> 09:22.180
And they're like, oh my god, the alarms are going off now.

09:22.180 --> 09:26.020
And you say, I know, but this is a pretty good shot right into the scream mouth, huh?

09:26.020 --> 09:26.660
Go.

09:26.660 --> 09:28.020
Or you say, like, my art.

09:28.020 --> 09:29.300
And then you heist the painting.

09:29.300 --> 09:32.820
And you're like, I'm a master thief.

09:32.820 --> 09:33.860
That's my art.

09:33.860 --> 09:35.700
It's the art of stealing shit.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.140
And then you paint it on them.

09:37.140 --> 09:39.460
But then you get them out of prison because that's your real art.

09:39.460 --> 09:40.180
You're a lawyer.

09:40.180 --> 09:45.220
There's a guy I follow on YouTube that my daughter loves his work.

09:45.220 --> 09:47.300
And I'm a fan too, named Joseph.

09:47.300 --> 09:51.620
And he does like Rube Goldberg machines.

09:51.620 --> 09:53.780
And he calls himself a kinetic artist.

09:54.340 --> 09:57.380
And that seems like a pretty easy one to lie about.

09:57.380 --> 10:01.860
Because if you say you're a kinetic artist, no one's really going to push you on it.

10:01.860 --> 10:06.500
And if they do, you just knock a can of pins over and be like, well,

10:06.500 --> 10:08.980
this one is still in the form of stages.

10:08.980 --> 10:10.260
Look at how they scattered.

10:10.260 --> 10:11.220
Isn't that interesting?

10:11.220 --> 10:12.340
It's definitely interesting.

10:12.340 --> 10:14.740
I knew they would all kind of do that.

10:15.460 --> 10:18.020
Just like that is how I meant for it to happen.

10:18.020 --> 10:19.060
Oh, wait, I've got it.

10:19.940 --> 10:20.580
I've got it.

10:20.580 --> 10:23.940
How many times have you been in a museum, right?

10:23.940 --> 10:25.860
And you come across something and you're like,

10:25.860 --> 10:28.180
is that a light switch or is that a piece of art?

10:28.180 --> 10:31.300
What you do is you claim that light switch as your art.

10:31.300 --> 10:32.980
Yeah, put a sticker on it.

10:32.980 --> 10:33.300
Right?

10:33.300 --> 10:35.300
And like you walk over to a trash can and you're like,

10:35.940 --> 10:36.900
this is my art.

10:36.900 --> 10:37.620
This bench.

10:37.620 --> 10:38.580
I made this bench.

10:38.580 --> 10:39.220
I love that.

10:39.860 --> 10:42.420
And then they're like, oh shit, I sat on that bench.

10:42.420 --> 10:43.780
And you say, what?

10:43.780 --> 10:45.540
And you get really mad about it.

10:45.540 --> 10:48.980
Who put this hippopotamus sticker on my light switch for the museum?

10:49.620 --> 10:50.820
You don't understand.

10:50.820 --> 10:54.180
The hippopotamus is my childhood.

10:55.620 --> 10:59.540
The light switch represents an old light switch I had in my house.

10:59.540 --> 11:01.060
And if you don't understand, that's on you.

11:01.060 --> 11:02.420
Because it's my art and it's subjective.

11:02.420 --> 11:03.060
Look at my hair.

11:03.060 --> 11:03.940
You know it's true.

11:03.940 --> 11:08.980
What if you're at the museum and when someone's like looking at a painting,

11:08.980 --> 11:12.020
you come up behind them and say, it belongs to the museum.

11:12.020 --> 11:14.180
And they would say, yeah, it is.

11:14.180 --> 11:14.980
It's in one.

11:14.980 --> 11:17.620
And you say, hello, impression is my art.

11:17.620 --> 11:19.140
I am not Harrison Ford.

11:19.140 --> 11:20.660
I'm in fact this question asked.

11:20.660 --> 11:22.660
Oh, or you walk up behind them and what's that?

11:22.660 --> 11:26.020
You're dressed like Caesar and you say, I was the statue of Caesar,

11:26.020 --> 11:29.460
but I came to life and you have to help me recover a tablet.

11:30.020 --> 11:30.980
I am art.

11:30.980 --> 11:32.020
I am art.

11:32.020 --> 11:33.700
I've been art the whole time.

11:33.700 --> 11:34.500
Art the whole time.

11:34.500 --> 11:37.060
I'm living art for thousands of years.

11:37.060 --> 11:38.100
Help me, Ben Stiller.

11:39.700 --> 11:42.340
Help me sneak some pants onto David.

11:42.340 --> 11:43.780
Because come on, man.

11:43.780 --> 11:46.580
Every time he wakes up at night, it's a whole thing.

11:46.580 --> 11:47.300
It's a whole thing.

11:47.300 --> 11:47.860
Where's that?

11:48.420 --> 11:50.020
You know, Night at the Museum.

11:50.020 --> 11:54.580
Where Ben Stiller turns around, there's a big flesh dick in his face.

11:54.580 --> 11:54.900
What?

11:54.900 --> 11:57.460
That's the most unrealistic thing about Night at the Museum.

11:57.460 --> 12:00.980
Because you know, the first thing he would say is, I'm stealing all of you.

12:00.980 --> 12:03.620
Yeah, everybody get in my van.

12:03.620 --> 12:05.300
I'm going to steal you all.

12:05.300 --> 12:09.700
And you get too far from the museum and like, I don't feel so pop on Mona Lisa now again.

12:09.700 --> 12:10.660
You're like, ha ha ha.

12:10.660 --> 12:11.460
Hell yeah, you are.

12:11.460 --> 12:12.580
Actually, you're confused.

12:12.580 --> 12:17.700
You are a beach house in Maui because I sold you already in my mind.

12:17.700 --> 12:18.660
How about Yahoo?

12:18.660 --> 12:19.140
Yeah.

12:19.140 --> 12:20.260
Here's one from Merit Polymer.

12:20.260 --> 12:20.660
Thanks, Merit.

12:20.660 --> 12:27.380
It's Yahoo Answers user, question mark, who asks, what problems do us farmers have?

12:28.420 --> 12:29.220
Right?

12:29.220 --> 12:30.820
It's confusing.

12:30.820 --> 12:31.460
A bit.

12:31.460 --> 12:36.340
Because you would think if it's us farmers, you would be familiar with the problems that

12:36.340 --> 12:38.980
you face in your chosen vocation.

12:40.020 --> 12:44.500
But maybe you live a sort of, you know, a semi-charm farm life, a semi-farm kind of

12:44.500 --> 12:48.020
life and it's going all good.

12:48.020 --> 12:50.180
And so, but you want to be able to relate to the other farmers.

12:50.180 --> 12:54.660
You go to the farm bar and you say like, oh, how's it going?

12:54.660 --> 12:56.500
Everyone's like, oh, not good.

12:57.220 --> 12:57.460
Why?

12:57.940 --> 12:59.940
You know, bean bugs.

12:59.940 --> 13:02.100
Oh, no, you got the bean bugs again?

13:02.100 --> 13:06.100
Yeah, these little guys climb up all my stalks and they take the beans back to their village

13:06.100 --> 13:07.700
to, you know, worship it or whatever.

13:07.700 --> 13:09.140
And then I don't have that to sell.

13:09.140 --> 13:10.500
Griffin, can I ask you a question?

13:10.500 --> 13:15.860
And I just want to clarify here because I have heard you on other podcasts talk about

13:15.860 --> 13:17.780
the magazine US Weekly.

13:17.780 --> 13:23.060
Is it possibly the question here is what issues do US farmers have?

13:23.780 --> 13:24.820
It's lowercase.

13:24.820 --> 13:26.660
Okay, we're probably good.

13:26.660 --> 13:27.160
Yeah.

13:27.160 --> 13:31.000
Yeah, what problems do us farmers have?

13:31.000 --> 13:32.200
I mean, the usual.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.800
That kind of sounds like a question someone trying to pretend to be a farmer in a farmer

13:37.800 --> 13:39.080
bar would say, right?

13:39.080 --> 13:43.160
Yeah, you guys know about the problems us farmers have, right?

13:43.160 --> 13:48.120
Yeah, they went to the grocery store and they bought a ear of corn and then they, you know,

13:48.120 --> 13:52.520
dug a little hole in their front yard and just laid the ear of corn gently down into

13:52.520 --> 13:55.080
it and they're like, well, I'm now in the farm life.

13:55.080 --> 13:57.720
So now I need more things to complain about.

13:57.720 --> 13:58.200
What's that?

13:58.200 --> 13:58.920
Bean bugs?

13:58.920 --> 14:00.760
Yeah, I hate those fucking things.

14:00.760 --> 14:02.120
I bet I've got them.

14:02.120 --> 14:05.160
I bet I probably have worse bean bugs than you, bean farmer.

14:05.960 --> 14:10.440
I mean, usual stuff, too, like economy is probably not, you know, great for them or

14:10.440 --> 14:11.560
maybe it's very good.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.280
Can't decide what to wear.

14:14.840 --> 14:19.400
Yeah, you know, some days you just go and stand in front of the mirror for 30 minutes

14:19.400 --> 14:23.400
and it's like, these shorts look like shit and I have stains on everything because of

14:23.400 --> 14:25.000
my rough farm life.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.440
What am I going to wear today?

14:26.440 --> 14:30.760
You know, and then you say, like, you know, I think I'm going to go with this black tea,

14:30.760 --> 14:35.320
but then you're out in the sun and the black tea gets so hot.

14:35.880 --> 14:40.760
So you go back and you change into like a crisp white tea and that's pretty good.

14:40.760 --> 14:42.200
Don't get me wrong, it's great.

14:42.200 --> 14:45.480
And it really shows off, I don't know, your muscles, probably.

14:46.360 --> 14:52.680
You know, the cartoon farmer aesthetic is overalls no shirt and that's maybe the worst

14:52.680 --> 14:57.960
imaginable scenario because then you get the hot downtown and the burnt burnt topside.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.200
Is there anything worse than that?

15:00.200 --> 15:01.800
I don't believe there is.

15:01.800 --> 15:08.920
You could complain with them about the absolutely miserable web interface of farmersonly.com.

15:08.920 --> 15:15.640
Yeah, it is just unthinkable in 2018 that this would be how you interact with this website.

15:15.640 --> 15:20.200
And that could be one of the things you bring up is like the images never load.

15:20.200 --> 15:26.200
Yeah, you could also like join them in a good round of complaining about how Farmville isn't

15:26.200 --> 15:29.400
really representative of the kind of work you actually do.

15:30.200 --> 15:31.720
So frustrating.

15:31.720 --> 15:32.920
That's not how it works.

15:32.920 --> 15:34.680
I don't just like click it till it grows.

15:34.680 --> 15:35.160
You know what?

15:35.160 --> 15:37.560
I'm out there with my machines.

15:37.560 --> 15:39.800
You do kind of click it till it grows though, right?

15:39.800 --> 15:41.000
Yeah, it's kind of like that.

15:43.080 --> 15:45.560
Is on FarmersOnly, I've never been on the website.

15:46.920 --> 15:47.800
There's a good reason.

15:47.800 --> 15:50.440
Well, yeah, I'm married, but I don't hate farmers.

15:50.440 --> 15:51.320
I don't want people to think that.

15:51.320 --> 15:55.640
No, I said I wasn't going to say because you're married, though that is a very good reason.

15:55.640 --> 15:56.440
I mean, because you, Griffin...

15:56.440 --> 15:57.640
Oh, yeah, I'm not a farmer.

15:57.640 --> 15:58.600
I'm not a farmer.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.000
The name's right there.

16:01.000 --> 16:08.520
Is there a heuristic, some sort of search filter you can apply to look at potential

16:08.520 --> 16:10.600
partners by their yield?

16:11.080 --> 16:13.880
Because that seems like the one I want to go with.

16:13.880 --> 16:22.120
I'm not as interested in interests or personality or looks or anything like that.

16:22.120 --> 16:30.120
I just want to know what the raw tonnage of carrots was for your institution last year

16:30.760 --> 16:37.240
because I'm here bringing in the payloads of this soybean and I'm killing,

16:37.240 --> 16:39.400
squashing bean bugs left and right, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.840
I got my son walking around.

16:40.840 --> 16:43.560
He's got his stomping boots on killing these nasty guys.

16:43.560 --> 16:47.240
And all my soybeans are coming in and I'm a top earner.

16:47.240 --> 16:50.040
My DPS rankings are off the fucking charts.

16:50.040 --> 16:51.880
I can't be messing around with somebody who's like,

16:51.880 --> 16:54.760
yeah, I brought in four buckets of carrots left.

16:54.760 --> 16:56.200
Four buckets?

16:56.200 --> 16:57.240
I can't love you.

16:59.560 --> 17:03.720
I do want to, as I did sign up for Farmers Only because I thought I would have some good

17:03.720 --> 17:05.960
stuff to kind of share with the show.

17:06.520 --> 17:12.440
I will say this is an irritating thing about FarmersOnly.com is that there is no field

17:12.440 --> 17:13.160
for yield.

17:13.160 --> 17:14.680
There's no yield field, sadly.

17:14.680 --> 17:15.240
Damn it.

17:15.240 --> 17:16.840
How could you get on there, Justin?

17:16.840 --> 17:20.200
What kind of lies did you have to perpetrate to get on Farmers Only?

17:20.200 --> 17:21.000
I got in deep.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.840
But here's the thing I want to share with you.

17:22.840 --> 17:24.440
There is no yield field.

17:24.440 --> 17:31.640
There is a field for profession, which like, I should hope I know the answer to that fucking

17:31.640 --> 17:32.520
question.

17:32.520 --> 17:34.600
I should hope that it's farmer.

17:34.600 --> 17:37.080
I hope that you should say type of farmer.

17:37.080 --> 17:37.580
I hope.

17:38.680 --> 17:40.040
Farmer specialization?

17:40.600 --> 17:40.840
Yeah.

17:40.840 --> 17:43.400
What's your- what are you spec'd in for farming?

17:43.400 --> 17:45.240
Are you dual wielding your field?

17:45.240 --> 17:46.680
Dual fielding, if you will?

17:47.400 --> 17:53.560
It also does have a place for your sign, which is not- I don't know why.

17:53.560 --> 17:56.040
I just did not expect that on FarmersOnly.com.

17:56.040 --> 17:57.000
He's a Virgo.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.840
Don't touch his tomatoes.

17:58.840 --> 17:59.480
You know why.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.000
They're nasty.

18:01.560 --> 18:08.520
I think you should have to print your FarmersOnly.com profile on all goods that you sell.

18:08.520 --> 18:16.600
I think that would be so great if I could buy a big vat of avocados and know sort of

18:16.600 --> 18:20.280
like what they're looking for in a potential special partner.

18:20.280 --> 18:23.800
That's a Scorpio's avocados right there.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.480
Scorpio avocado's delicious.

18:26.360 --> 18:30.600
You think if they got their own dating website, I never thought about this before, probably

18:30.600 --> 18:32.360
pretty tight-knit crew, right?

18:32.360 --> 18:33.160
Yep, yep.

18:33.160 --> 18:39.160
Is- is there a secret farmers market after a sex party?

18:39.160 --> 18:43.240
If there was that, they wouldn't need the website, is what I would suggest.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.800
Oh, they want to so bad.

18:45.800 --> 18:46.680
They want to so bad.

18:46.680 --> 18:54.520
They see my rutabaga, I see, you know, their- their onions, and I'm like, oh my god, I'm

18:54.520 --> 18:57.240
feeling it so hard and they're craving my wave.

18:57.240 --> 19:02.200
Anytime that you leave a farmers market and there's nobody there, like when it's abandoned

19:02.200 --> 19:07.480
and it's rare, so like you could never see it by definition, but anytime that there are

19:07.480 --> 19:13.000
no customers at a farmers market, every single stall is just shouting back and forth to each

19:13.000 --> 19:17.640
other like, are you all like crazy horny?

19:17.640 --> 19:21.400
And they will all say like, yes, we're all extremely horny.

19:21.400 --> 19:21.880
If only-

19:21.880 --> 19:23.800
I wish we didn't have to sell this veg.

19:23.800 --> 19:24.280
Yeah.

19:24.280 --> 19:28.760
I'm very worried because Griffin, because as you pointed out, the farmers are very tight-knit

19:28.760 --> 19:32.920
and I'm worried that they will know that Justin is not a farmer, but he has signed on to their

19:32.920 --> 19:38.040
website and they're going to come for him and I'm worried about my brother.

19:38.040 --> 19:40.600
Oh, he's going to get run over by a big tractor.

19:40.600 --> 19:43.960
Justin, I think you're going to need to start farming right now.

19:43.960 --> 19:45.400
Yeah, like right now, bud.

19:45.400 --> 19:46.440
All right, good luck.

19:46.440 --> 19:51.480
There's no, like unless they're like pinging my IP address, I don't think they're going

19:51.480 --> 19:51.800
to track me.

19:51.800 --> 19:53.400
What if they're listening right now?

19:53.400 --> 19:57.720
You guys think there's a bumper sticker that says, farmers don't make love, they plow?

19:57.720 --> 20:03.960
Oh no, for sure there is.

20:03.960 --> 20:09.480
I'm going to, if not, mackleroymerch.com, just go get that.

20:10.920 --> 20:13.160
I want to ask you guys another question.

20:13.160 --> 20:17.800
For about a year now, I've been collecting screenshots of men on Tinder or OkCupid,

20:17.800 --> 20:21.480
holy up a fish, lobster and crab in their profile pictures.

20:21.480 --> 20:23.400
I have nearly 150 now.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.360
Oh my God.

20:24.360 --> 20:25.400
What should I do with them?

20:25.400 --> 20:27.480
And why do men think this is attractive?

20:27.480 --> 20:30.360
That's from Hook, Line and Tinder in Nova Scotia.

20:30.920 --> 20:37.160
I mean, the obvious thing, and this is, I mean, there are some very old, I guess,

20:37.160 --> 20:41.560
preconceived notions that the man should be the provider.

20:41.560 --> 20:50.520
And maybe he is trying to display his skills at providing sustenance.

20:50.520 --> 20:53.560
This is the protein I could provide for you.

20:53.560 --> 20:57.560
This is the protein that I'm bringing to the relationship.

20:57.560 --> 21:01.240
The question asker has provided a screenshot.

21:01.240 --> 21:04.280
I can't stop, it's really good.

21:04.280 --> 21:07.320
There's something, there's two curious things.

21:07.320 --> 21:11.960
One, all these boys are so proud of these things they killed in the water.

21:11.960 --> 21:14.120
And that's great to me, good job, boys.

21:14.120 --> 21:18.120
You got really rowdy under the sea and you just really got those guys.

21:19.320 --> 21:22.600
Here's the other thing, and stop me if I'm way off base here,

21:22.600 --> 21:24.920
but I'm looking, there is a lot of lobsters.

21:24.920 --> 21:27.400
And a lot of these lobsters are really huge.

21:27.400 --> 21:33.480
I'm saying of this 20 image chunk they sent over, good 11 of them are lobsters.

21:33.480 --> 21:38.280
And boys, I swear to God, the same lobsters in a lot of these pictures.

21:40.840 --> 21:42.280
I don't know what the answer is there.

21:42.280 --> 21:44.840
Maybe a few of these boys went on the same fishing trip.

21:44.840 --> 21:46.360
They caught a lobster and they're like, all right,

21:46.360 --> 21:49.560
let's all take pictures of it and put it up on our dating profile.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.000
And that would explain it.

21:51.000 --> 21:57.800
Maybe there's just one weird sort of rental lobster pickup service

21:57.800 --> 22:01.160
where you go and you get the big lobster and you take a picture with it.

22:01.160 --> 22:05.080
They make it look professional, make it look like you did just kill it in the ocean.

22:05.080 --> 22:08.520
And then you bring it right back and you give them their $40 or whatever.

22:08.520 --> 22:11.800
Is it the lobster maybe who's renting himself out?

22:11.800 --> 22:13.880
Like, yeah, I'll make you look real nice.

22:13.880 --> 22:14.680
Come on in.

22:14.680 --> 22:16.280
All right, boys, what are we doing?

22:16.280 --> 22:16.840
What do we got?

22:16.840 --> 22:18.280
We got profile pictures.

22:18.280 --> 22:18.840
Okay, good.

22:18.840 --> 22:22.200
Go ahead and put a strap on my claw.

22:22.200 --> 22:23.640
I let you pick the color.

22:24.680 --> 22:25.640
That's fine.

22:25.640 --> 22:26.520
Okay, that's good.

22:26.520 --> 22:29.560
Now just scoot me up and you get three shots.

22:29.560 --> 22:32.120
So make them good, okay?

22:32.120 --> 22:34.280
You want to put on the overalls?

22:34.280 --> 22:34.840
You don't have to.

22:34.840 --> 22:35.560
Make sure you...

22:36.360 --> 22:37.160
Let me turn on.

22:37.160 --> 22:42.440
I got a green screen background of a rain-slicked day in St. John's.

22:42.440 --> 22:42.920
Hold on.

22:43.720 --> 22:44.760
All right, good.

22:44.760 --> 22:47.240
Is that really the face you're gonna fucking make, pal?

22:47.240 --> 22:53.080
Because let me spritz the camera a little bit and make the lens look like it's raining on there.

22:53.080 --> 23:01.880
Listen, some fellas find it helps if they imagine the process of obtaining me from the sea.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.560
So maybe you want to give that a whirl.

23:03.560 --> 23:05.480
I'll give you a second in private.

23:05.480 --> 23:06.600
I can't be in here.

23:06.600 --> 23:08.200
I'll fucking puke.

23:08.200 --> 23:12.920
But go ahead and just get yourself ready and then we'll just do this thing, okay?

23:12.920 --> 23:17.800
I also really like the dude in the top left who has the lobster like it's a parrot on his shoulder.

23:17.800 --> 23:19.080
Yeah, he's got a friend here.

23:19.080 --> 23:21.960
Because it fucking reminds me of Muppet's Treasure Island.

23:21.960 --> 23:24.520
All the other ones are like, I just caught this.

23:24.520 --> 23:26.920
That picture might be like, this lobster?

23:26.920 --> 23:28.840
I've had this lobster since I was a baby.

23:28.840 --> 23:29.720
This is my cousin.

23:33.400 --> 23:35.160
I'm just now noticing that he's a lobster.

23:35.160 --> 23:36.840
Thank you for pointing that out, actually.

23:36.840 --> 23:40.440
A bunch of the boys are making sort of a duck mouth face

23:40.440 --> 23:45.480
to sort of let you know that they're, you know, bad boys.

23:45.480 --> 23:51.320
Unless what they're actually doing is doing a pantomime kiss to let you know,

23:51.960 --> 23:54.840
this is the kind of stuff I can haul out of the ocean.

23:54.840 --> 23:57.560
And this is what I'll look like when I'm kissing you because of it.

23:58.280 --> 24:04.200
Which I think is like a really concise sales pitch to be contained inside of a single JPEG.

24:04.200 --> 24:05.000
Like you can do...

24:05.960 --> 24:07.320
What was the question though?

24:07.320 --> 24:08.200
What was the question?

24:08.200 --> 24:09.400
What am I going to do with this?

24:09.400 --> 24:11.320
What should I do with them? You can't do anything with them.

24:11.320 --> 24:12.200
Like now you can't.

24:12.200 --> 24:12.600
You gotta...

24:12.600 --> 24:13.880
This is your secret collection.

24:13.880 --> 24:17.560
You can't like make this a public thing.

24:17.560 --> 24:18.200
You don't want to...

24:18.200 --> 24:18.840
Because you know what?

24:18.840 --> 24:22.920
The thing about it is I'm not sure I would notice individually.

24:22.920 --> 24:28.040
It only becomes notable as a collective, right?

24:28.040 --> 24:33.800
Like you don't think about it until you see a lot of them back on the next to each other.

24:33.800 --> 24:37.720
You really need the full like a wall of pictures in front of you before you're like,

24:37.720 --> 24:40.360
wait a minute and then you can Kaiser Sose it all together.

24:40.360 --> 24:41.000
Yeah.

24:41.000 --> 24:47.240
It's been the same lobster the entire time.

24:47.240 --> 24:48.760
Here's what I would do if I were you.

24:48.760 --> 24:54.360
I would also start collecting photos of men on dating websites posing with dogs

24:54.360 --> 24:58.840
and then try to find men from lobster and dog photos who look similar

24:58.840 --> 25:03.000
and try to construct the narrative where the person's dog was cursed and turned into a lobster.

25:03.000 --> 25:03.640
Yes, that's good.

25:03.640 --> 25:05.320
And you can like write a book about it.

25:05.320 --> 25:07.160
Or lobster to dog.

25:07.160 --> 25:10.200
It's up to you which direction you want to go.

25:10.200 --> 25:11.880
Just for the facial hair.

25:11.880 --> 25:15.560
You could elevate this I think if you were one of these very proud boys

25:16.600 --> 25:20.200
and have one image of you with the big lobster that you definitely caught.

25:20.200 --> 25:22.600
And the second image is you with that.

25:22.600 --> 25:24.680
And this is what would entice me.

25:24.680 --> 25:28.360
You with that lobster cooked, butter poached, delicious looking.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.800
Also, they're holding up today's newspaper to let you know, come and get it.

25:31.800 --> 25:35.560
Do they ever do this on the dating websites where they're like,

25:35.560 --> 25:38.440
they show you a big crock pot full of stew

25:38.440 --> 25:45.640
and then they're holding today's newspaper to let you know, act fast, first come first serve.

25:45.640 --> 25:52.280
I think you should have, there should be a special indicator on every dating profile.

25:52.280 --> 25:54.760
And it's either if it's red, that means nothing.

25:54.760 --> 25:58.600
If it means, if there's a green light, it means, hey, I've got a stew on right now.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.120
Right this second.

26:00.120 --> 26:02.680
Right, you can include it in the bio,

26:02.680 --> 26:06.360
but you're going to be doing a lot of updates just like one day later.

26:06.360 --> 26:09.080
Just like, sorry ladies, no stew today.

26:09.800 --> 26:10.840
I got busy.

26:12.600 --> 26:13.720
I got busy.

26:13.720 --> 26:16.200
I had sex last night because of the stew.

26:16.840 --> 26:18.120
So I'm good for a little bit.

26:18.120 --> 26:20.360
You don't want me to rush it.

26:20.360 --> 26:21.000
Yeah.

26:21.000 --> 26:25.160
I'll put a gumbo on tomorrow and we'll go ahead and just flip.

26:25.160 --> 26:25.880
Watch this face.

26:25.880 --> 26:27.560
We'll do a slow crock pot.

26:27.560 --> 26:31.080
That'll give me at least, if I started at noon on Tuesday,

26:31.080 --> 26:35.240
it'll give me until, I don't know, probably 8pm Wednesday.

26:35.240 --> 26:37.240
So anywhere in there that you want to come over.

26:39.800 --> 26:42.040
If you agree to date me right now,

26:42.040 --> 26:46.760
I have three fourths of a German chocolate cake that my mom made and she left it here.

26:47.320 --> 26:52.520
If you agree to be my girlfriend now, you could have some of this cake.

26:52.520 --> 26:57.000
Our first date will include some of this cake that my mom made me and left at my apartment.

26:57.000 --> 27:01.320
I will save some for you, but I get the last piece because my mommy made it.

27:01.320 --> 27:01.560
Yep.

27:02.360 --> 27:06.120
See, if this were me, I would have four pictures as my dating profile.

27:06.120 --> 27:08.280
Picture one, holding up the lobster.

27:08.280 --> 27:09.080
Got to, got to, got to.

27:09.080 --> 27:10.360
I just caught it.

27:10.360 --> 27:14.040
Picture two, me holding the lobster over a pot of boiling water.

27:14.680 --> 27:18.360
And making a face like, here comes the cook.

27:18.360 --> 27:19.000
Here it goes.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.840
But then photo three, now I'm hugging the lobster.

27:22.840 --> 27:25.560
Picture four, I'm watching with tears in my eyes

27:25.560 --> 27:28.520
as that lobster graduates from college with honors.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.000
And then he's holding a lobster.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.280
Yeah, that's your son.

27:36.280 --> 27:37.720
He's holding your son.

27:37.720 --> 27:46.680
Now, if your picture was a giant lobster holding a tiny man with his hands rubber banded together,

27:47.240 --> 27:48.600
that's a profile picture.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.600
I want to get to know that crustacean.

27:50.600 --> 27:54.360
Yeah, and the big lobster be holding today's newspaper trying to attract the lady lobster.

27:54.360 --> 27:58.760
She was like, do they eat people?

27:58.760 --> 28:01.480
Oh yeah, if they're big enough, for sure, for sure.

28:01.480 --> 28:02.920
Yeah, they would, for sure.

28:02.920 --> 28:03.640
Asked and answered.

28:04.680 --> 28:09.240
Let's take a quick break and we're going to head on over to the Money Zone.

28:19.880 --> 28:22.200
Can I tell you all about Stitch Fix?

28:22.200 --> 28:23.240
I wish you would.

28:23.240 --> 28:29.400
Stitch Fix has helped me, and this is no joke, revolutionize my wardrobe.

28:29.400 --> 28:33.160
Here's the thing I've never had before that Stitch Fix has helped me with.

28:33.160 --> 28:39.880
I've got clothes that are like my winter clothes and now like my spring and summer clothes.

28:39.880 --> 28:46.440
I would say that if you have ever seen a picture from, I would say September 2017 on,

28:47.000 --> 28:49.480
of like I was performing at a live show and you've thought,

28:49.480 --> 28:53.960
oh, I really like Travis's shirt there, 90% chance that's from Stitch Fix.

28:53.960 --> 28:59.480
Yeah, when we are on the road, we're always comparing like, hey, where is that from?

28:59.480 --> 29:00.440
Oh yeah, Stitch Fix.

29:00.440 --> 29:01.000
Yeah, me too.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.120
This is from Stitch Fix.

29:02.120 --> 29:03.240
And it's not just shirts.

29:03.240 --> 29:07.640
Like I get pants, shirts, socks, shoes, jackets.

29:07.640 --> 29:09.960
Like they'll put together whole outfits for you.

29:09.960 --> 29:14.840
And one of my favorite things that they do is they send you a card along with all the

29:14.840 --> 29:19.640
clothes that shows what would go with what, what you could add to stuff that's in the box

29:19.640 --> 29:21.080
to make an outfit.

29:21.080 --> 29:24.920
And like, they give you suggestions of like, it would, you could wear it for this.

29:24.920 --> 29:26.600
And like, it would work with this.

29:26.600 --> 29:28.840
And you have a stylist that you can talk to.

29:28.840 --> 29:32.760
And like, when you send stuff back, you say like, I really love this.

29:33.960 --> 29:35.080
This was okay.

29:35.080 --> 29:35.800
I didn't like this.

29:35.800 --> 29:37.480
You return the stuff you don't want to wear.

29:38.360 --> 29:42.920
And that helps them update their profile for you of your style.

29:42.920 --> 29:48.360
And like, every time it's a better and better fit for both like, how it fits, but also like,

29:48.360 --> 29:48.920
your style.

29:48.920 --> 29:49.560
It's great.

29:49.560 --> 29:52.760
And it's free to ship the stuff back and to get it.

29:52.760 --> 29:55.880

I want to tell y'all about Wink.

30:07.160 --> 30:08.840
Do you like Wink?

30:08.840 --> 30:15.880
You like wine, but I went to go buy wine for my Eurovision party and I look at the wine

30:15.880 --> 30:18.200
and my mind just melts.

30:18.920 --> 30:20.680
I can't make any heads or tails of it.

30:20.680 --> 30:24.120
Some are red, some are white, some are pink, some are blue.

30:24.120 --> 30:26.520
Don't get that one unless you should.

30:26.520 --> 30:27.720
And that's a very rare one.

30:27.720 --> 30:29.240
I don't actually have the answers.

30:29.240 --> 30:29.960
But you know who does?

30:29.960 --> 30:30.920
It's Wink.

30:30.920 --> 30:35.640
Wink makes it easy to discover great wines personalized for you starting at just $13 a

30:35.640 --> 30:35.960

30:37.640 --> 30:38.600

30:44.040 --> 30:45.560
suggest some wines for you.

Go to trywink.com slash my brother.

31:00.600 --> 31:03.240
You'll get $20 off your first shipment.

31:03.240 --> 31:10.120
That's trywink, T-R-Y-W-I-N-C dot com slash my brother.

31:10.120 --> 31:11.960
You get $20 off.

31:11.960 --> 31:17.640
That's trywink.com slash my brother.

31:17.640 --> 31:22.680
I'm really glad there's no questions asked because sometimes I have some really shady

31:22.680 --> 31:24.600
reasons that I don't like a bottle of wine.

31:25.320 --> 31:32.920
It's also worth noting that our exclusive URL trystink.com does work if you don't want

31:32.920 --> 31:34.680
to use that URL.

31:34.680 --> 31:37.800
You can use the URL trystink with a K.

31:37.800 --> 31:41.160
When did we pick that one up, Juicer?

31:41.160 --> 31:42.680
I don't know when we got trystink.

31:42.680 --> 31:43.880
Because it's insulted.

31:43.880 --> 31:49.560
It's a weird dig at the sponsor so it's kind of a weird choice you made.

31:49.560 --> 31:51.000
It's not really.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.240
I don't know how we got that one.

31:53.240 --> 32:00.360
You would probably be better off using trywink W-I-N-C dot com slash my brother.

32:00.360 --> 32:05.880
If you find that hard to remember, I'm sure that Wink would prefer you just take advantage

32:05.880 --> 32:09.240
of their services no matter what fucking URL you have.

32:09.240 --> 32:10.440
That's true, Juicer.

32:10.440 --> 32:11.960
I don't know, Justin.

32:11.960 --> 32:16.040
I'd be worried that they would know somehow and I would get my first shipment of wine,

32:16.040 --> 32:19.400
but also a note that's like, did we do something to upset you?

32:19.400 --> 32:25.000
The emails that we get this week will tell the tale of how Wink feels about their URL

32:25.000 --> 32:26.760
being manhandled like this.

32:26.760 --> 32:30.920
I want to tell you all about Dungeons and Hangovers and Orcs, Orcs, Orcs.

32:30.920 --> 32:32.280
It's two things.

32:32.280 --> 32:35.720
Let me start doing it right now.

32:35.720 --> 32:40.600
Dungeons and Hangovers purveys fun, original D&D adventure modules to the discerning gamer.

32:40.600 --> 32:46.360
Our publications include The Unquiet, a cozy autumnal adventure inspired by Hana Dollwatch

32:46.360 --> 32:53.080
and Snow Daemon, a tale of Krampus set in a magical mountain village where it's always

32:53.080 --> 32:54.680
winter but never candle nights.

32:54.680 --> 32:59.720
This spring, we're releasing our first Dungeons and Hangovers triple shot, a three-pack of

32:59.720 --> 33:05.080
short, chuckle-fest adventures playtested at Orcs, Orcs, Orcs, our tavern pop-up in

33:05.080 --> 33:06.600
Portland, Oregon.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.280
That all sounds extremely good.

33:08.280 --> 33:11.160
If I lived in Portland, you know I'd be hitting up Orcs, Orcs, Orcs.

33:11.160 --> 33:15.880
I don't still know what a pop-up is, although they say that word a lot on like Top Chef

33:15.880 --> 33:20.920
and I'm like, is it a restaurant that you pull both sides of and it inflates?

33:20.920 --> 33:22.760
And I think the answer is yeah, probably.

33:22.760 --> 33:29.400
But visit DungeonsandHangovers.com slash WhereIsWizardHut for an adventure pandering exclusively

33:29.400 --> 33:30.600
to Mbem Bambinos.

33:30.600 --> 33:33.800
Portland folks, come hang out at Orcs, Orcs, Orcs.

33:33.800 --> 33:34.920
I got a message.

33:34.920 --> 33:35.880
It's for Chloe.

33:35.880 --> 33:37.480
It's for Ian and Sarah.

33:37.480 --> 33:41.960
And it's for Joanna and the super secret friend zone.

33:41.960 --> 33:43.400
And it's from Sean.

33:43.400 --> 33:45.400
It says, I love you all.

33:45.400 --> 33:50.760
I cherish the time we spend playing games, talking about anime or the latest Taz, or

33:50.760 --> 33:52.920
teasing Ian with puns.

33:52.920 --> 33:59.240
After Bone Folder, Chloe's rise to fame at Boston Mbem Bamb, that's her Mbem Bamb show

33:59.240 --> 34:05.080
there, I decided to immortalize us all via JTron, which is a fun slang.

34:05.080 --> 34:10.680
For JonTron, everyone's favorite disgraced video game streamer.

34:10.680 --> 34:14.840
Congrats on upcoming weddings for Chloe and Ian and Derek and Anna.

34:14.840 --> 34:16.600
That's going to be one hell of a wedding.

34:16.600 --> 34:17.640
Got to get to that event.

34:17.640 --> 34:23.800
To my friends and the McElroys all, thank you, keep on boning down hard.

34:23.800 --> 34:24.760
Okay.

34:24.760 --> 34:25.560
All right.

34:25.560 --> 34:27.480
All right.

34:27.480 --> 34:33.240
Not usually how this arrangement works is I get sort of sexual encouragement from the

34:33.240 --> 34:34.360
listeners of this show.

34:34.360 --> 34:39.880
Usually it's we make a horse joke here, a ghost joke here, and you send an email in.

34:39.880 --> 34:41.560
It's like, that's great.

34:41.560 --> 34:46.440
I don't even know that I want more of that.

34:46.440 --> 34:49.640
That's weird.

34:49.640 --> 34:54.440
I don't even know that I enjoy that sensation of that.

34:54.440 --> 34:54.940
Cool.

34:56.040 --> 34:57.800
Trav, you want to read this last Jumbotron?

34:57.800 --> 34:58.300
Yeah.

34:58.760 --> 35:04.520
This is from Rocket Ship and from, no, for Smelly It.

35:05.400 --> 35:06.120
All right.

35:06.120 --> 35:08.840
Happy birthday, old Ramble Gamble.

35:08.840 --> 35:11.160
Now, why didn't we go with that nickname?

35:11.160 --> 35:14.360
Why did we start with Smelly It and work our way to Ramble Gamble?

35:14.360 --> 35:15.000
Okay.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.160
Thanks for goofing and aloofing with me.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.240
You all.

35:21.240 --> 35:23.000
And here's to many years more.

35:23.000 --> 35:27.800
Thanks for being the best bestie, a strong independent woman who don't need no man could

35:27.800 --> 35:28.440
have.

35:28.440 --> 35:30.760
The best thing here is the preferred time frame.

35:30.760 --> 35:32.600
Yes, I see you've just gotten there.

35:32.600 --> 35:33.720
I just hit it.

35:33.720 --> 35:38.760
The preferred time frame is read this anytime I don't actually know when his birthday is.

35:39.960 --> 35:43.960
That's somebody, because the Jumbotrons are in demand now, I think we had a lot of people

35:43.960 --> 35:47.000
that were just kind of like blasting through.

35:47.000 --> 35:47.960
Hip firing.

35:47.960 --> 35:48.280
Sure.

35:48.280 --> 35:50.120
It's just like, it's hype anything.

35:51.880 --> 35:52.440
Hi, everybody.

35:52.440 --> 35:53.400
I'm Justin McElroy.

35:53.400 --> 35:54.840
And I'm Dr. Sydney McElroy.

35:54.840 --> 35:59.240
Every week, we release a medical history podcast called Sawbones.

35:59.240 --> 36:04.040
We go over the history of the dumbest, grossest, weirdest stuff humans have been doing to each

36:04.040 --> 36:05.800
other since the dawn of mankind.

36:05.800 --> 36:07.400
But it's a funny show.

36:07.400 --> 36:12.680
But it's also so disgusting and stomach turning, you won't believe it.

36:12.680 --> 36:15.320
But it's also like funny.

36:15.320 --> 36:16.040
It's funny.

36:16.040 --> 36:21.160
It is the wildest, grossest, nastiest stuff you can imagine.

36:21.160 --> 36:22.120
It's a real hoot.

36:22.120 --> 36:23.160
It's called Sawbones.

36:23.160 --> 36:29.080
And we release it every week on iTunes, wherever podcasts are sold, and right here on maximumfun.org.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.360
How about Yahoo?

36:32.360 --> 36:33.320
I love that, Griffin.

36:33.320 --> 36:34.040
Thank you.

36:34.040 --> 36:35.240
You ran my mind.

36:35.240 --> 36:36.040
Yeah, sure.

36:36.040 --> 36:38.120
This one is sent by a couple folks.

36:38.120 --> 36:38.600
Thank you.

36:38.600 --> 36:41.800
It's Yahoo Answers user bad guy who asks.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.400
I'm going to stand.

36:43.400 --> 36:44.280
Oh.

36:44.280 --> 36:45.960
Should I lift up my standing desk?

36:45.960 --> 36:46.760
Should I stand?

36:47.320 --> 36:48.920
I feel like I just wanted to stand.

36:48.920 --> 36:49.720
Okay, let's try it.

36:49.720 --> 36:50.280
I'm going to stand.

36:50.280 --> 36:51.400
So I'm just going to stand.

36:51.400 --> 36:55.080
I will extend the arm of my microphone stand.

36:55.080 --> 36:56.120
It's still going up.

36:56.120 --> 37:00.120
One of the things about stand up is you want to be standing up.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.360
No, that's not from Steve.

37:02.360 --> 37:03.320
That one's from me.

37:04.040 --> 37:05.160
But you could use it.

37:05.160 --> 37:06.840
I feel like I'm going to yell now.

37:06.840 --> 37:07.960
Get the energy flowing.

37:07.960 --> 37:08.520
All right, here we go.

37:08.520 --> 37:09.720
Let's go, Yahoo.

37:09.720 --> 37:13.880
Yeah, bad guy asks, when feeling the heat,

37:13.880 --> 37:17.320
do you usually bail out or stay for the action?

37:17.320 --> 37:18.280
Oh, boy.

37:18.280 --> 37:19.880
So glad I stood for this.

37:19.880 --> 37:21.880
Yeah, this is a thinker regardless.

37:21.880 --> 37:24.200
This one's worth the effort.

37:24.200 --> 37:28.440
So I've been told before, like the, you know, the kitchen,

37:28.440 --> 37:30.120
that the kitchen is hot.

37:30.120 --> 37:31.640
Yeah, but I don't like that.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.320
I should go to the living room.

37:33.320 --> 37:36.840
Yeah, that's what they say when they're trying to get you psyched up for fucking sports.

37:36.840 --> 37:38.600
When it gets difficult, for sure.

37:38.600 --> 37:42.200
And it's like, if you don't like the kitchen because of the temperature,

37:42.200 --> 37:45.080
feel free to sit in the living room, coward.

37:45.080 --> 37:47.400
Yeah, I would rather be doing that though.

37:47.400 --> 37:49.000
That's like where all my devices are.

37:49.560 --> 37:53.080
Sometimes I'm at a party and I see two people starting to fight.

37:53.720 --> 37:55.400
And I think I better start it.

37:55.400 --> 37:58.520
But I learned something from my friend Charles Groton.

37:58.520 --> 38:02.840
He said, we can't possibly keep doing the Steve Martin.

38:02.840 --> 38:05.560
We cannot possibly keep doing the Steve Martin.

38:05.560 --> 38:10.120
He has been doing it for 40 years and look where it's gotten him.

38:10.120 --> 38:11.480
I'm so psyched, boys.

38:11.480 --> 38:14.200
Because this may surprise you to learn.

38:14.200 --> 38:18.120
Really, really good answers from Yahoo Answers users on this one.

38:18.120 --> 38:19.160
It does surprise me.

38:19.800 --> 38:23.720
Best answer, little big man says, I stay for the action, my friend.

38:23.720 --> 38:25.480
Asker gave that one five stars.

38:25.480 --> 38:27.480
So that's the best answer, all of them.

38:27.480 --> 38:28.760
I agree to disagree.

38:29.640 --> 38:30.680
How is it the best answer?

38:30.680 --> 38:33.320
They chose one of the two binary options.

38:33.320 --> 38:38.920
They included the phrase, my friend, Justin, which is like, oh, we just made a connection.

38:38.920 --> 38:39.560
Five stars.

38:40.120 --> 38:41.800
Like the most interesting man in the world, right?

38:41.800 --> 38:42.920
I love his shit.

38:42.920 --> 38:47.640
How about this one from Rick29148 who says, not me, baby.

38:47.640 --> 38:48.520
I'm out of here.

38:51.800 --> 38:52.520
Not me, baby.

38:52.520 --> 38:53.560
I'm out of here.

38:53.560 --> 38:54.760
Not for the Rick.

38:54.760 --> 38:59.640
I stayed a year ago and burned my toes so badly, they actually brought in a surgeon

38:59.640 --> 39:01.480
to make sure they were worth saving.

39:01.480 --> 39:03.640
Took a year, but nine of them are okay.

39:03.640 --> 39:06.280
One of them still giving me troubles.

39:06.280 --> 39:07.080
Wait, what?

39:07.640 --> 39:10.600
How did this become a real world scenario for Rick?

39:10.600 --> 39:11.640
Just had some fun.

39:11.640 --> 39:12.920
Rick just had some fun.

39:12.920 --> 39:14.440
Hey, Griffin, have you ever looked at Yahoo?

39:15.320 --> 39:19.320
Does the original question asker pick the best answer?

39:19.320 --> 39:19.960
Is that something?

39:20.520 --> 39:21.560
Okay, why?

39:22.600 --> 39:31.400
What makes the question asker qualified to decide who is most correct about their question?

39:31.400 --> 39:34.760
It seems like by definition, they know the least about it, right?

39:34.760 --> 39:35.240
Yeah, that's fair.

39:35.240 --> 39:38.200
So like, how do they have any insight into whether or not you should leave your-

39:39.160 --> 39:43.960
Sounds like it's getting pretty hot in here, Justin, with all your questions.

39:44.760 --> 39:45.880
Travis, where are you going?

39:46.680 --> 39:48.040
Come back.

39:48.040 --> 39:50.040
No, I don't want to do the show anymore.

39:50.040 --> 39:51.400
It's too hot in here.

39:51.400 --> 39:53.160
Yeah, it's pretty hot.

39:53.160 --> 39:59.000
I'm staying even though these piggies are sizzling, but I'm gonna stay and keep reading

39:59.000 --> 40:00.520
bad things people said online.

40:00.520 --> 40:03.800
Like Cab, who says, I'm bringing the gasoline.

40:03.800 --> 40:05.400
Fuck yeah, dude.

40:05.400 --> 40:06.600
Yeah, Cab.

40:06.600 --> 40:07.720
Yeah, Cab.

40:07.720 --> 40:12.840
This is a dookie website with a bullshit question with a question that didn't mean anything

40:12.840 --> 40:14.760
and an answer that was garbage.

40:14.760 --> 40:16.200
Fuck yeah, dude.

40:16.200 --> 40:16.700
Get it.

40:18.200 --> 40:19.400
Me, motherfucker?

40:20.120 --> 40:21.480
I'm gonna spice it up.

40:21.480 --> 40:23.960
I'm gonna spice it up Cab style, baby.

40:23.960 --> 40:25.800
God, no, it's too hot again.

40:26.840 --> 40:27.720
Travis is out.

40:27.720 --> 40:28.680
Got too hot.

40:28.680 --> 40:29.880
I told him it was cool.

40:29.880 --> 40:35.480
Pour a little Cabernet Sauvignon on this, which is my way of saying I'm gonna heat it up.

40:35.480 --> 40:36.920
Hey, let's hit you with this one.

40:36.920 --> 40:38.840
Question mark says, turn on the AC.

40:38.840 --> 40:41.160
Anonymous says, turn on the AC.

40:42.200 --> 40:45.160
So got a couple little double down on that one.

40:45.160 --> 40:49.320
I wish the other one would be turn on the AC DC and kind of just crank it up.

40:49.880 --> 40:50.600
Thunderstruck.

40:50.600 --> 40:51.320
Get in there.

40:51.320 --> 40:52.040
Jump in the fire.

40:52.040 --> 40:53.480
Oh God, I just got back here.

40:53.480 --> 40:54.360
Can we please?

40:54.360 --> 40:55.400
Yeah, Travis, let me calm it down.

40:55.400 --> 40:56.600
I'll calm it down.

40:56.600 --> 40:57.720
I'm gonna bring it down with this one.

40:57.720 --> 40:59.080
It's easy.

40:59.080 --> 41:03.400
Blue Sky says, I jump into the frying pan.

41:04.040 --> 41:05.240
Fuck yes.

41:05.240 --> 41:06.280
Are you kidding me?

41:07.320 --> 41:08.040
Wait, hold on.

41:08.040 --> 41:10.120
That's not one of the options in the saying.

41:10.120 --> 41:11.480
It doesn't matter.

41:11.480 --> 41:12.360
It doesn't matter.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.200
It's not like if you can't stay in the kitchen, get into the frying pan.

41:16.200 --> 41:17.400
Like that's not the fucking-

41:17.400 --> 41:21.320
Just so many fucking righteous guys on here.

41:21.320 --> 41:24.040
Just so many fucking cool bros.

41:24.040 --> 41:27.320
Just fucking let me know how sick they are.

41:27.320 --> 41:31.800
Just holding up their giant fish and lobster in their profile pictures.

41:31.800 --> 41:33.000
Let me ask you guys a question.

41:33.640 --> 41:38.920
When it starts cooling down, and I mean getting really cool, do you stay or do you go?

41:38.920 --> 41:41.240
I mean, like it's way too chill.

41:41.240 --> 41:41.960
You know what I mean?

41:41.960 --> 41:45.960
Like everybody's too chill to remember to like eat.

41:45.960 --> 41:47.080
Yeah, yeah, Travis.

41:47.080 --> 41:47.560
You know what?

41:47.560 --> 41:49.560
If given those two options, you know what I'd do?

41:49.560 --> 41:52.680
Stick my balls in the icebox, baby.

41:52.680 --> 41:53.000
Whoa.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.520
Oh hell yeah, dude.

41:54.520 --> 41:55.400
That wasn't-

41:55.400 --> 41:56.600
Chill them out.

41:56.600 --> 41:58.280
No, I'm saying like it's chill.

41:58.280 --> 41:59.240
Everybody's relaxed.

41:59.240 --> 42:00.760
Stay for the action.

42:00.760 --> 42:03.240
Here's the best answer because it's the only realistic one.

42:03.240 --> 42:06.120
The only one that sort of actually mirrors my beliefs.

42:07.080 --> 42:11.080
Dark Places says, want to stay, but bail.

42:16.360 --> 42:22.760
Yeah, there is a fucking very quick sort of turnaround on, God, this party's amazing.

42:22.760 --> 42:25.320
To, I have to go.

42:25.320 --> 42:27.160
I can't be here.

42:27.160 --> 42:31.400
There's like, there's three human bodies difference between those two things.

42:32.440 --> 42:36.920
And also I'm building this question on fucking theory and hyperbole.

42:37.480 --> 42:39.160
I'm 37 years old.

42:39.160 --> 42:40.680
I actually have no idea.

42:40.680 --> 42:44.360
Justin watches the mask and the bit where he says P-A-R-T-Y.

42:44.360 --> 42:48.840
Justin has to sit there for a few minutes and actually sort of think of what the answer would be.

42:48.840 --> 42:50.680
That's a great question, James.

42:50.680 --> 42:52.520
Why are we partying?

42:52.520 --> 42:54.440
Our time is so limited.

42:54.440 --> 42:55.240
So fleeting.

42:55.240 --> 42:56.520
Thank you, James.

42:56.520 --> 42:58.840
And thank you to LMFAO for apologizing.

42:58.840 --> 43:00.600
It was a bit transgressive.

43:00.600 --> 43:03.000
I was having a good time and you rolled up.

43:03.000 --> 43:07.480
You had a, you know, 48 natty lights and you're like, let's get fucking twisted.

43:07.480 --> 43:11.400
And I was like, I was having a good time catching up with my friends, but I'll see you guys later.

43:12.760 --> 43:13.640
Jesus Christ.

43:14.200 --> 43:15.080
Can we sit back down?

43:15.960 --> 43:17.960
No, no, this is, you gotta get up for this.

43:17.960 --> 43:27.240
I have a creaky floorboard right under me and I just found it.

43:27.240 --> 43:28.680
I want to munch!

43:28.680 --> 43:29.240
Squared!

43:31.480 --> 43:33.560
I want to munch!

43:33.560 --> 43:34.040
Squared!

43:37.160 --> 43:37.960
Welcome to Munch Squad.

43:37.960 --> 43:43.480
It's a podcast within a podcast celebrating the latest and greatest in quick serve restaurants.

43:43.480 --> 43:46.040
McDonald's and Sprite announced the debut of

43:46.600 --> 43:47.240
Oh God.

43:47.240 --> 43:54.760
A new multi-faceted marketing campaign created in celebration of mix, all caps.

43:55.400 --> 43:59.000
So when I say the word mix a few times in the next few moments,

43:59.000 --> 44:00.840
you'll know why I'm saying it like that.

44:00.840 --> 44:01.960
Because it's in all caps.

44:02.520 --> 44:10.600
It's a celebration of mix by Sprite Tropic Berry, a sparkling soft drink made with natural flavors.

44:12.600 --> 44:13.320
Yeah, sure.

44:14.040 --> 44:16.600
Each one's got four crushed up berries in it.

44:16.600 --> 44:17.720
Yeah, sure Sprite.

44:17.720 --> 44:18.760
Sure Sprite, okay.

44:19.720 --> 44:23.000
It's 2018, we're all just lying, okay.

44:23.720 --> 44:33.320
Including pineapple, orange, and strawberry blended with a classic crisp lemon-lime taste of Sprite.

44:33.320 --> 44:36.520
Available just for McDonald's customers.

44:36.520 --> 44:41.240
Don't go into Aldi thinking you're gonna get the mix.

44:41.880 --> 44:42.600
Because you're not.

44:42.600 --> 44:45.400
You're only gonna get it at McDonald's and that's why the marketing campaign is called

44:45.400 --> 44:46.920
That's the Mix.

44:46.920 --> 44:50.600
You should only do that if you dress up like a time traveler from the future.

44:50.600 --> 44:54.360
And you roll up to Aldi like, I'll have the pineapple Sprite.

44:55.000 --> 44:59.240
I don't know what beautiful world you come from, but here we just got the plain one.

44:59.240 --> 44:59.720
Damn it.

45:00.360 --> 45:06.680
Do you think that they mean natural flavors in the sense that like they are present in this dimension?

45:07.240 --> 45:08.440
Yes, you taste them.

45:08.440 --> 45:11.720
Like these are natural this dimension flavors.

45:11.720 --> 45:13.880
A Warlock didn't conjure them.

45:13.880 --> 45:14.280
Exactly.

45:14.280 --> 45:19.000
Hey dumb-dumbs, I'm loving all this, but I'm never gonna get to the fashion line if you don't let me.

45:20.600 --> 45:25.160
That's the Mix is gonna launch this Friday when we're recording this on Wednesday.

45:25.160 --> 45:28.840
I'm sorry, it was last Friday, May 25th.

45:28.840 --> 45:30.520
It's probably already sold out.

45:30.520 --> 45:38.360
A dedicated Spotify takeover featuring the premiere of an exclusive new track and music

45:38.360 --> 45:47.160
video about this soda from multi-platinum rapper Kyle, all caps, just like Mix, and an original

45:47.160 --> 45:54.040
custom capsule collection by leading streetwear designer Joe Freshgoods.

45:56.760 --> 45:59.960
And I'm sure he'll continue to be a leading streetwear designer

45:59.960 --> 46:04.920
with McDonald's and their special pineapple drink on his resume.

46:04.920 --> 46:10.680
If you're in Atlanta, Chicago, and Los Angeles, New York, you can go to a select McDonald's there

46:10.680 --> 46:16.280
and you're gonna have the rare opportunity to take home items from the That's the Mix capsule

46:16.280 --> 46:21.800
collection, including a, which I guess a capsule collection must mean something else because I'm

46:21.800 --> 46:25.720
thinking Gachapon, but I guess it's just a small collection of clothes maybe.

46:25.720 --> 46:27.240
I don't understand exactly.

46:27.240 --> 46:31.160
But they're clothes that don't have seasonal application.

46:31.160 --> 46:32.120
Okay, thank you.

46:32.120 --> 46:38.840
Yes, they're including a wool and leather varsity jacket, a long sleeve t-shirt about a soda,

46:38.840 --> 46:44.440
short sleeve t-shirt about a great new sprite with pineapple, and socks with McDonald's on them.

46:45.000 --> 46:50.440
Beginning at 2 p.m. local time, fans who visit one of the participating locations and say out

46:50.440 --> 46:53.320
loud, I'd like the clothes about the juice, please.

46:53.320 --> 47:00.440
They're going to get pieces from the collection which will be available exclusively at McDonald's

47:00.440 --> 47:05.080
while supplies last, which should be for quite some time, I would imagine.

47:06.360 --> 47:10.840
Now, Linda Van Gosen decides to get fucking hysterical.

47:10.840 --> 47:14.760
Linda opens with, we're mixing things up, so to speak.

47:17.560 --> 47:19.320
That's the mix right there.

47:19.320 --> 47:20.600
That is the mix.

47:20.600 --> 47:22.040
That's the mix, Linda.

47:23.400 --> 47:27.240
We're mixing it up in McDonald's with a new exclusive drink.

47:27.240 --> 47:32.200
I don't know why McDonald's gets its rocks off keeping soda from people,

47:32.200 --> 47:34.680
but that is McDonald's whole fucking thing.

47:34.680 --> 47:35.560
They love it.

47:35.560 --> 47:45.560
The flavor, she says, this vice president of menu innovation, the flavor is craveable and delicious.

47:45.560 --> 47:50.520
That would be so weird if it was craveable and disgusting.

47:50.520 --> 47:52.760
Why do I like this so much?

47:52.760 --> 47:53.800
I can't stop.

47:53.800 --> 47:55.320
I hate it.

47:55.320 --> 47:57.960
Please free me from this.

47:57.960 --> 47:59.000
I hate it.

47:59.000 --> 48:03.400
And we know our customers will come back for more of this unique beverage,

48:03.400 --> 48:05.480
which I think is called That's the Mix.

48:05.480 --> 48:11.240
I'm trying to, it just says it's in celebration of Mix by Sprite Tropic Berry.

48:11.240 --> 48:14.600
I guess that's the actual name of the soda.

48:14.600 --> 48:17.560
Yes, it is Mix by Sprite Tropic Berry.

48:18.760 --> 48:23.720
The program launched to McDonald's All American Games Fan Fest on March 25th in Atlanta,

48:23.720 --> 48:28.600
where Kyle premiered That's the Mix, a song about a soda with a live performance,

48:28.600 --> 48:33.880
and fans had the chance to visit the Mix by Sprite Tropic Berry Dug Zone.

48:37.640 --> 48:40.280
Where they were instantly dissolved.

48:40.280 --> 48:43.560
Hi, I'm multi-platinum rapper Kyle.

48:43.560 --> 48:48.760
Welcome to the Mix by Sprite Tropic Berry Dug Zone.

48:48.760 --> 48:50.520
Would you like to hear my new song?

48:50.520 --> 48:52.040
It's about a clear beverage.

48:52.040 --> 48:53.000
That has flavors.

48:53.000 --> 48:53.960
Does that make it?

48:53.960 --> 48:55.160
Now you into it?

48:55.160 --> 48:55.960
They're natural.

48:56.760 --> 49:01.080
I would not kick this jacket out of my closet for eating crackers, boys.

49:02.280 --> 49:03.320
Is it good?

49:03.320 --> 49:08.440
I'll say this, Joe Freshgoods lives up to that name.

49:08.440 --> 49:12.200
I also want to say I just shared in Skype with you a link to Joe Freshgoods' website.

49:12.200 --> 49:14.280
Yeah, it's the best website I've ever seen.

49:14.280 --> 49:17.160
Yeah, specifically his collabs page.

49:17.160 --> 49:18.840
I'm actually not seeing any of the images.

49:18.840 --> 49:21.800
I'm just seeing the message that says, I've been killing shit lately.

49:21.800 --> 49:23.720
Page under construction until further notice.

49:23.720 --> 49:25.000
That is correct.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.120
That's all that's on there.

49:26.120 --> 49:27.880
Fuck yeah, Joe Freshgoods.

49:27.880 --> 49:28.920
I don't need anything else.

49:28.920 --> 49:29.640
I believe you.

49:31.400 --> 49:32.760
That's a great message from Joe.

49:32.760 --> 49:33.960
Things are going very well.

49:33.960 --> 49:38.040
I apparently don't need a website, so I'm not going to make one right now.

49:38.040 --> 49:41.160
And then when I need one later, I will make a website.

49:41.160 --> 49:49.880
So to get this stuff to participate, you purchase a Mix by Sprite Tropic Berry or any soft drink.

49:49.880 --> 49:51.480
Oh, huh.

49:51.480 --> 49:58.520
On May 25th, and you take your receipt to the organized line and wait in line to see

49:58.520 --> 50:01.480
the prize you won while supplies last.

50:02.520 --> 50:07.880
To participate without making a purchase, you must obtain a free method entry form at

50:07.880 --> 50:12.200
the participating restaurant and complete it with your first and last name, your date

50:12.200 --> 50:16.280
of birth, email address, and then take your completed entry form to the organized line

50:16.280 --> 50:19.400
and wait in line to see the prize you won while supplies last.

50:19.400 --> 50:22.760
Can you imagine an exchange more buckwild than,

50:22.760 --> 50:25.880
Hi, I'm here to win the soda jacket.

50:25.880 --> 50:30.440
I won't be purchasing any beverages because I hate it.

50:31.960 --> 50:34.280
I'm a big fan of the idea of soda.

50:34.280 --> 50:38.360
I love the concept of this new exclusive drink that you're keeping from the plebs that can't

50:38.360 --> 50:39.720
get into McDonald's.

50:39.720 --> 50:44.440
And I love this drink and I just want the jacket, but I'm not buying one today.

50:44.440 --> 50:50.200
So I would like to sit here in this McDonald's and fill out an order form, an entry to perhaps

50:50.200 --> 50:53.560
win the great jacket about the soda.

50:53.560 --> 50:57.080
And at this point in our episode, I would like to fast forward like, I don't know, a

50:57.080 --> 51:02.280
year when McDonald's has gone out of business and Ronald is sitting in an empty McDonald's

51:02.280 --> 51:04.200
with Kyle and Joe Freshgoods.

51:04.200 --> 51:09.480
And they're just like sitting on folding chairs and like Ronald raises his drink and they

51:09.480 --> 51:10.040
cheers him.

51:10.040 --> 51:13.720
And he goes, I think we can all agree that was the mix.

51:13.720 --> 51:15.480
And then like fade to credits.

51:15.480 --> 51:16.520
And then the boat sinks.

51:18.120 --> 51:22.280
Every few weeks, my friend brings his Wii U over to my house to play Smash Brothers.

51:22.280 --> 51:26.200
While playing, we typically trash talk and poke fun at each other.

51:26.200 --> 51:30.840
My four year old daughter loves to watch us and comments on how we're doing.

51:30.840 --> 51:34.840
One day I was pretty handily beat to stock in about a minute.

51:34.840 --> 51:35.400
What's that mean?

51:36.360 --> 51:40.760
You had two lives and you got knocked off the map by, you know, Ness's big baseball

51:40.760 --> 51:41.800
bat swing, probably.

51:41.800 --> 51:46.120
My friend, excited in his win, called me a fucking scrub.

51:47.000 --> 51:51.480
Excited by my devastation, my daughter turned to me and shouted quite loudly, you fucking

51:51.480 --> 51:51.980
scrub.

51:51.980 --> 51:58.440
How do I get my daughter to love me again and respect my premium game skills?

51:58.440 --> 52:00.440
And should I worry about her swearing?

52:00.440 --> 52:01.480
Probably not, right?

52:01.480 --> 52:04.840
That's from Sulking in Smashville slash Denver.

52:04.840 --> 52:07.160
I think you need to worry about you being a fucking scrub.

52:07.160 --> 52:08.280
Yeah, that's a problem, huh?

52:08.280 --> 52:13.720
You're so quick to assign blame to everybody else in this situation, except for yourself,

52:13.720 --> 52:17.480
for getting fucking completely dunked on in Final Destination.

52:17.480 --> 52:20.200
Like, L2P maybe a little bit?

52:20.200 --> 52:25.320
Like, maybe before you start throwing stones, look at your own glass house and how quickly

52:25.320 --> 52:28.680
it shatters under the, you know, Salvo Falco's punches.

52:28.680 --> 52:32.680
Especially when you talk about your daughter respecting your quote unquote premium game

52:32.680 --> 52:33.180
skills.

52:34.040 --> 52:36.600
Yeah, kind of sounds like you got put in the toilet.

52:36.600 --> 52:40.120
Yeah, and like, maybe your daughter is now the daughter of your friend.

52:40.760 --> 52:42.280
Yeah, sounds like, yeah.

52:42.280 --> 52:47.560
If my daughter started calling me a fucking scrub, I'd tell her to pick up a controller

52:47.560 --> 52:48.600
and back up those words.

52:48.600 --> 52:50.360
1v1 me.

52:50.360 --> 52:55.160
If you're gonna talk shit, you better 1v1 me, and we'll kind of see who is the best

52:55.160 --> 52:55.880
at Smash Brothers.

52:55.880 --> 52:58.760
I don't understand what button punches in that game.

52:58.760 --> 52:59.800
It's always been a mystery to me.

52:59.800 --> 53:03.880
My daughter could probably beat me through randomness, so this may not be a great tack.

53:03.880 --> 53:05.800
But like, still, 1v1 me, daughter.

53:05.800 --> 53:10.840
And to be fair, Justin did teach his beautiful daughter, Charlie, my niece who I love very

53:10.840 --> 53:16.200
much, to tell me, her uncle who loves her very much, that she is going to kick his ass.

53:16.200 --> 53:20.520
So that is a thing that now I live with all the time.

53:20.520 --> 53:25.560
I've been teaching my daughter to curse for a long time, and I hope that I never reach

53:25.560 --> 53:26.760
a point where I regret it.

53:27.320 --> 53:32.760
And perhaps I will, but you guys can take heart in teaching your children to curse,

53:32.760 --> 53:38.120
confident in the knowledge that if it ever dawns on me that it was a huge mistake, then

53:38.120 --> 53:40.040
I can kind of warn you away.

53:40.040 --> 53:47.240
I can be the lighthouse on the Isle of Cursing, and I can ward your ship into safer waters.

53:47.240 --> 53:51.640
We'll have about two and a half years, like, you'll be able to travel back in time, so

53:51.640 --> 53:54.920
to speak, to us and say, don't make the same mistakes I did.

53:54.920 --> 53:57.400
I'm just gonna teach my son weird cuss words.

53:57.400 --> 53:58.120
Okay.

53:58.120 --> 54:03.000
Okay, not the main ones, but like, you know, piss.

54:05.880 --> 54:07.240
That's the only one?

54:07.240 --> 54:10.840
What was the last time you said, unironically, bastard?

54:10.840 --> 54:11.560
You know what I mean?

54:11.560 --> 54:12.120
Yeah.

54:12.120 --> 54:17.560
My daughter came into our room, and it was 530 in the morning, and we were just trying

54:17.560 --> 54:20.760
to snooze a little bit, so we were trying to get her to just, like, lay down and try

54:20.760 --> 54:21.960
to sleep a little bit.

54:21.960 --> 54:28.600
And then from next to me, I hear, that light on your TV is really annoying, and it's this

54:28.600 --> 54:33.080
blue light that is on on our TV in our bedroom, always.

54:33.080 --> 54:36.040
And I say, yeah, it is really annoying.

54:36.040 --> 54:41.800
And there's about 90 seconds of silence, and then I hear, that light's fucking crazy.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.920
It is, yeah, it is, sweetie.

54:48.920 --> 54:50.120
It is fucking crazy.

54:50.120 --> 54:50.920
That's true.

54:50.920 --> 54:55.080
I don't know why that light does what it does, but you're right.

54:55.080 --> 54:57.080
And you're like, okay, Coop, we're going back to bed.

54:57.080 --> 54:58.440
Those are your first words, eh, Coop?

54:58.440 --> 54:59.000
Thanks.

54:59.000 --> 54:59.720
Great.

54:59.720 --> 55:02.120
Well, this has been a heck of a lot of fun.

55:02.120 --> 55:03.400
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

55:03.400 --> 55:05.000
I'm loving standing.

55:05.000 --> 55:05.880
I'm going to make that a thing.

55:05.880 --> 55:07.080
You know, I'm a little over it.

55:07.640 --> 55:08.360
Okay.

55:08.360 --> 55:11.800
Well, because once I stood up, I realized, like, well, where do I go from here?

55:11.800 --> 55:12.600
You know what I mean?

55:12.600 --> 55:15.160
I feel great if I can get in control of the room.

55:15.160 --> 55:15.720
Anyway.

55:15.720 --> 55:22.520
So real quick, I wanted everyone to know, next weekend, Dad and I are going to be in

55:22.520 --> 55:28.520
a live stream that Wizards of the Coast is doing to announce their new D&D campaign,

55:28.520 --> 55:29.800
their new D&D story.

55:30.760 --> 55:33.480
And the stream is called Stream of Many Eyes.

55:34.920 --> 55:36.120
Dad is performing in one.

55:36.120 --> 55:37.000
I'm performing another.

55:37.000 --> 55:41.720
We're going to be, Merle and Magnus, with different DMs.

55:41.720 --> 55:45.320
My DM is Chris Perkins, which I'm, like, super excited about.

55:45.320 --> 55:45.880
Yes.

55:45.880 --> 55:46.360
I know.

55:46.360 --> 55:48.760
You are in for a good sesh, my friend.

55:48.760 --> 55:49.720
I'm very excited.

55:49.720 --> 55:52.360
It's going to be live streamed, so you can watch it from wherever.

55:53.080 --> 55:58.360

55:58.360 --> 56:03.480

56:03.480 --> 56:05.640
Or you can just, like, look on our Twitter accounts.

56:05.640 --> 56:06.440
We tweeted about it.

56:07.960 --> 56:09.000
We're going on the road.

56:11.320 --> 56:13.080
Okay, Travis, did you misspell-

56:13.080 --> 56:14.120
I can't believe it.

56:14.120 --> 56:14.440
Fuck!

56:14.440 --> 56:16.040
I misspelled our own last name.

56:16.040 --> 56:17.320
I spelled McElroy-

56:17.320 --> 56:19.160
Go to m-a-c-e-l-r-

56:20.600 --> 56:22.680
McElroy shows dot com slash tours.

56:22.680 --> 56:31.080
We're going to be in Phoenix in June and in Orlando and Atlanta at the end of August.

56:31.080 --> 56:37.400
And also, we're going to be doing some shows for our book tour, which are going to be more,

56:37.400 --> 56:40.360
like, Q&A with some readings of the book.

56:40.360 --> 56:41.480
But those are still going to be fun.

56:41.480 --> 56:42.360
Those are in July.

56:42.360 --> 56:46.280
You can find details on all that at McElroy shows dot com slash tours.

56:46.280 --> 56:51.800
Or you can pre-order the graphic novel at theadventurezonecomic dot com.

56:51.800 --> 56:55.480
My wife and I, Sydney and her sister Taylor, we wrote a book.

56:55.480 --> 56:58.680
It's called The Sawbones Book.

56:58.680 --> 57:00.360
It's about our podcast Sawbones.

57:00.360 --> 57:01.480
It's not about our podcast.

57:01.480 --> 57:02.920
It's not like a behind the scenes.

57:02.920 --> 57:05.240
It's similar to our podcast, Taylor to the Illustrations.

57:06.520 --> 57:10.280
And it's going to be great if you go to bit.ly forward slash Sawbones Book.

57:10.280 --> 57:13.480
It comes out in October, but you can pre-order it now.

57:13.480 --> 57:14.760
And I hope you really like it.

57:14.760 --> 57:15.880
Uh, one last thing.

57:15.880 --> 57:19.000
We have a merch website, McElroy Merch dot com.

57:19.000 --> 57:23.480
We are constantly, well not constantly, but we are trying to add new stuff to it as often

57:23.480 --> 57:24.200
as possible.

57:24.200 --> 57:29.800
And I will say right now, I am wearing our Adventure Zone Bureau of Balance hoodie.

57:29.800 --> 57:32.280
It is so incredibly comfortable.

57:32.920 --> 57:38.920
And 90s Travis loves it because there's holes sewn into the cuffs that I can put my thumbs

57:38.920 --> 57:39.720
through.

57:39.720 --> 57:40.520
Fantastic.

57:40.520 --> 57:41.560
I love it.

57:41.560 --> 57:45.480
We've also got a new, we're doing a Bureau of Balance bracer that's only going to be

57:45.480 --> 57:50.840
on pre-sale for another like week or so.

57:50.840 --> 57:52.120
I think another week.

57:52.120 --> 57:55.400
And there's also a monthly pin that changes out.

57:56.440 --> 58:01.400
May's is an abracafuckupin, available in both explicit and non-explicit.

58:01.400 --> 58:02.280
Cause we were curious.

58:02.280 --> 58:07.080
Getting some interesting A, B comparisons on how nasty y'all are.

58:07.080 --> 58:10.600
Yeah, largely nasty, but some not so nasty.

58:10.600 --> 58:11.240
Interesting.

58:11.240 --> 58:12.520
That's at McElroy Merch dot com.

58:13.160 --> 58:16.440
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure

58:16.440 --> 58:17.960
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

58:17.960 --> 58:19.720
I've been listening to that one this week.

58:19.720 --> 58:20.280
It's a good one.

58:20.280 --> 58:21.720
Some of the older albums too.

Nick and Clara made some business cards for Justin McElroy.

59:13.560 --> 59:15.320
Best in the biz and they're really funny.

59:15.320 --> 59:16.440
How many of them did they make?

59:16.440 --> 59:17.080
A good question.

59:17.080 --> 59:23.000
They made 420 and also 69 of them and put them in the same box divided into those groupings

59:23.000 --> 59:23.640
of numerals.

59:23.640 --> 59:24.600
So thank you to everyone.

59:25.560 --> 59:28.120

59:33.640 --> 59:35.080
Asks Schwab.

59:37.160 --> 59:40.600
Is there anybody born in the 20th century alive?

59:43.240 --> 59:44.520
My name is Justin McElroy.

59:44.520 --> 59:46.120
I'm Travis McElroy.

59:46.120 --> 59:47.400
I'm Griffin McElroy.

59:47.400 --> 59:48.760
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

59:48.760 --> 01:00:01.800
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:19.960
Coming up Simpsons.

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:24.280
Every episode we cover a different episode of the Simpsons that is a favorite of our

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:25.160
special guest.

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:29.080
We've had guests that are showrunners and writers and voice actors like Nancy Cartwright.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:34.680
And we've also had people that are on the Max Fun Network already.

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:37.560
Homer wearing that golf outfit is so funny.

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:42.840
And when he gets super into golf, he's wearing the golf hat in bed.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:45.080
We've had Weird Al Yankovic on the show.

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:47.800
I was just struck by how sharp the writing is.

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:49.720
I mean, that's no surprise because it's the Simpsons.

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:53.400
But I mean, like, you can't say that about a lot of TV shows, particularly ones that

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.800
at that point had been on the air for 14 years.

01:00:55.800 --> 01:01:00.920
Find us on Maximumfun.org, iTunes or wherever you get your podcasts.

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:01.400
All right.

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:19.400
Smell you later.
