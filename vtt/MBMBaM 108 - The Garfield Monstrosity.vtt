00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.480
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, The Advice Show for the modern era,

00:49.440 --> 00:55.600
and we are celebrating today No More Human Interaction for a year.

00:55.600 --> 01:00.880
Yay! Back to the safety of my shell.

01:00.880 --> 01:06.320
We did Max Fun Con, it was great. We did E3, it was great. I'm done.

01:06.960 --> 01:10.560
Was it? I'm done talking to everybody.

01:10.560 --> 01:15.040
I know Max Fun Con was great. I don't believe you when you say that E3 was great.

01:15.040 --> 01:18.640
Okay, Max Fun Con, it was great. I did E3, it was...

01:20.240 --> 01:23.200
So did you guys have a good time at Max Fun Con?

01:23.200 --> 01:26.000
Max Fun Con was amazing. We made so many new friends,

01:26.000 --> 01:29.120
and there was a man who had a plate of sausages in a hot tub.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.920
That's really the only thing I took away from the entire weekend.

01:31.920 --> 01:36.000
Jesus, guys. Did you not go? Did you not do like any of the...

01:36.000 --> 01:39.040
Did you do the... Like, I went on the spelunking session.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.640
You went on the spelunking session?

01:40.640 --> 01:47.200
Yeah, I went on Ashcon's spelunking session. It was called Ashcon Subterranean Adventure.

01:47.200 --> 01:50.080
Yeah, huh. Subterranean on the late night.

01:50.080 --> 01:58.320
Yeah, it was really nice. We went down deep inside of the mountain, and we fought mole people.

01:58.960 --> 02:03.600
Is that where you... You brought back a sword that was glowing that had some runes etched on it.

02:03.600 --> 02:11.760
It was an etched runed glow sword that lets me know when there are either mole people

02:11.760 --> 02:19.520
or podcasters nearby. So that bitch was going full blown neon the whole weekend.

02:19.520 --> 02:25.600
Now, see, I did the Steve AG's Lazy River session, and I ended up at the bottom of the mountain.

02:25.600 --> 02:29.360
I don't know what happened, and it was terrifying. It was not lazy at all.

02:29.360 --> 02:35.840
Now, the tricky thing about my etched rune sword is that John Hodgman is both a podcaster and a

02:35.840 --> 02:38.000
mole man. Right, so that was...

02:38.000 --> 02:42.160
So I didn't know whether to strike or to giggle.

02:42.800 --> 02:46.800
Last year at the con, I got myself an etched rune sword, but it just lets...

02:46.800 --> 02:49.120
It glows whenever haters are around.

02:49.120 --> 02:49.520
Yeah.

02:49.520 --> 02:54.960
So it lets me know when haters around the corner are about to hate on me.

02:56.080 --> 02:59.360
There weren't that many haters at Max Fun Con, though, were there?

02:59.360 --> 03:03.360
No, no, no, no, no, no. But at E3, it glued so hard, it became sentient and blinded

03:03.360 --> 03:07.200
an Asian businessman. So that was too bad.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.640
This is, of course, an advice program. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

03:12.640 --> 03:14.640
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

03:14.640 --> 03:18.640
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Seriously, guys, if you came out to Max Fun Con,

03:18.640 --> 03:21.680
thank you so much. It really was such a great weekend.

03:21.680 --> 03:24.240
You are all collectively my new best friend.

03:24.240 --> 03:24.480
Yeah.

03:24.480 --> 03:28.640
And L.A., fuck, I'm glad to not be in you anymore.

03:29.840 --> 03:30.640
Hey, L.A.

03:30.640 --> 03:35.840
Hey, L.A., just one quick note. Just, you know, constructive criticism.

03:35.840 --> 03:36.800
You fucking suck.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.400
No, you know what? I'm in the minority.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.960
I'm in the minority of the three, brother. I love L.A.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.080
I'm gonna get a t-shirt that says so.

03:44.080 --> 03:44.640
We love you!

03:46.720 --> 03:47.680
I mean, it was...

03:47.680 --> 03:49.760
Travis walked around with stars in his eyes.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.720
I was like, where's the contracts, people?

03:53.280 --> 03:57.520
I will say, I saw so many celebs. No kidding.

03:58.160 --> 03:58.400
Like...

03:58.400 --> 03:59.200
I saw a shocking...

03:59.200 --> 04:02.320
Aside from, of course, the great celebs there at Max Fun Con, how many...

04:03.360 --> 04:06.320
What celebs did you actually get? What did we get on the show floor?

04:06.320 --> 04:11.200
We got... Well, I saw... We saw Tim Heidecker coming out of the Arclight when we went and saw...

04:11.200 --> 04:14.640
Yeah, he was at our show of Prometheus.

04:14.640 --> 04:18.320
Shitty... Shitty Alien... Shitty Aliens 4.

04:18.320 --> 04:22.720
Um... I saw... I saw Dave Foley just, like, walking the street with his kid.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.360
What? Cut me out. No way.

04:25.360 --> 04:31.840
I saw the saddest thing I saw all week was I saw Verne Troyer rolling into the conference center.

04:32.400 --> 04:34.400
And then I saw a man trip over him.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.840
What? How can you guys say you hate L.A.?

04:39.760 --> 04:40.080
Um...

04:40.880 --> 04:43.520
Well, let's say... Let's just say none of these people were smiling.

04:43.520 --> 04:46.000
Did you guys talk to Dave Foley, by the way?

04:46.000 --> 04:47.120
No, he didn't have the nerve.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.240
I don't know what I would have...

04:48.960 --> 04:50.080
I don't know what I would... Like...

04:50.880 --> 04:52.720
Like, fuck, man. I'm so sorry.

04:53.760 --> 04:54.320
Can I help?

04:54.960 --> 04:58.000
Is there anything I can do to help you, Dave? David?

04:58.640 --> 05:00.560
I'm so... Let's get you back on track.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.840
I just want to set you straight. Is there anything I can...

05:05.040 --> 05:07.040
I can help chip in. Is that a...

05:07.680 --> 05:10.960
We didn't talk to Tim Heidecker either, Travis. We really needed you with us.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.040
See, this is why I should always be there.

05:13.040 --> 05:15.120
Pardon me, sir. Pardon me.

05:15.120 --> 05:19.600
I saw... Who's the woman from Leeds and the West Wing?

05:19.600 --> 05:20.640
Mary Louise Parker?

05:20.640 --> 05:24.000
I thought I saw her at the Burger King and the LAX,

05:24.000 --> 05:25.920
but that doesn't seem very probable, does it?

05:25.920 --> 05:28.000
No, it was probably her. You're probably right.

05:28.560 --> 05:32.880
She was there with, like, a family of, like, maybe a husband and a daughter.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.160
I didn't do the trouble of Wikipediaing it.

05:36.160 --> 05:39.440
I just saw her while I was walking out with my tinder crisp, and I was like,

05:40.000 --> 05:41.360
yeah, that's probably Mary Louise Parker.

05:41.360 --> 05:44.400
The thing about Mary Louise Parker, she loves chicken tenders.

05:44.400 --> 05:47.520
She was eating a chicken tender through a rice mile,

05:47.520 --> 05:50.080
and I was like, oh, that's probably the MLP.

05:50.080 --> 05:54.320
She calls them chicken tenders. That's how excited about them she gets.

05:54.320 --> 05:58.080
She's like, Justin, let's go to the BK, get some tenders.

05:58.080 --> 06:01.920
And I'm like, I don't know, MLP? I'm married.

06:01.920 --> 06:02.480
I'm not sure.

06:02.480 --> 06:05.920
She also calls Nintendo Nintenders, which is really weird.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.080
Let's get into the advice.

06:08.080 --> 06:13.440
Um, I'm going to be driving across the country at the end of June,

06:13.440 --> 06:16.320
and I'm wondering if you have any advice for doing a cross-country road trip.

06:17.120 --> 06:21.520
Mostly, I'm wondering how to avoid going insane while driving by myself

06:21.520 --> 06:24.560
for 12 hours at a time, five days in a row.

06:24.560 --> 06:26.720
That's from West Coast to Best Coast.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.760
Oh, Jesus.

06:28.720 --> 06:32.560
It's urine for a pretty rough trip.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.000
It's going to be kind of a thing.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.160
I did this exactly once.

06:36.160 --> 06:40.640
I drove from Cincinnati down to Huntington and then from Huntington up to Boston.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.920
And most of that was by myself.

06:43.920 --> 06:47.280
And it was a total, it was a total nightmare.

06:47.280 --> 06:52.640
I drove from Huntington to Oklahoma and back a couple times.

06:52.640 --> 06:53.140
Yeah.

06:54.800 --> 06:59.360
I've never taken the plunge and gone completely across country.

06:59.360 --> 07:04.000
I mean, I think everybody at some point like fantasizes about doing like the Route 66,

07:04.000 --> 07:05.680
traveling the American highway.

07:06.640 --> 07:10.400
And I think that that lasts all of about five hours.

07:10.400 --> 07:13.760
And then you hit like Pennsylvania and you're like, oh, this is dump.

07:14.240 --> 07:14.740
Yeah.

07:14.740 --> 07:18.160
Well, actually Pennsylvania is great because Pennsylvania has the turnpike that is,

07:18.160 --> 07:21.680
I think the speed limit on it is 158 miles an hour.

07:21.680 --> 07:25.440
So you can just like get in and it's like a vacuum tube that like sucks you through the state

07:25.440 --> 07:27.520
as quickly as humanly possible.

07:27.520 --> 07:31.760
Whenever I picture doing that, like Route 66, you know, cross-country thing, I always just,

07:31.760 --> 07:35.040
always just, and I know that this is the eight-year-old in me.

07:35.040 --> 07:40.400
I want to stop at every like roadside attraction and giant plaster dinosaur.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.480
Let me taste your gravy.

07:42.480 --> 07:43.200
Yeah.

07:43.200 --> 07:46.000
Now I see here you have the world's best coffee cake.

07:46.720 --> 07:47.840
Let me get a piece of that, please.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.120
I would like to experience this.

07:49.840 --> 07:56.240
I always imagine that if I'm going to drive from one end of the country and another along the way,

07:56.240 --> 07:57.760
I'm going to right a lot of wrongs.

07:57.760 --> 08:01.120
And I don't right wrongs in my neighborhood.

08:01.120 --> 08:04.560
But I kind of feel like if I do that, I'm going to become a wanderer.

08:05.120 --> 08:06.560
And I want to be the kind of wanderer.

08:06.560 --> 08:10.800
I don't want to be the kind of wanderer that steals your kid when they're going to the bathroom.

08:10.800 --> 08:15.840
I want to be the kind of wanderer that sets things right and helps people,

08:15.840 --> 08:19.280
you know, finds people that are missing or maybe like-

08:19.280 --> 08:21.760
So you want to like quantum leap across the country.

08:21.760 --> 08:25.760
Figures out who stole the pie, just like helping, you know?

08:25.760 --> 08:29.040
I want to be like a, like came from kung fu, just helping people.

08:29.040 --> 08:31.200
Or Bill Bixby.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.880
I wish I did that here, but I don't know.

08:32.880 --> 08:37.040
Everybody knows me and they think I'm just, they think like I'm hypocritical.

08:37.040 --> 08:39.840
I think every person of a certain age has that.

08:41.200 --> 08:48.400
Whenever they do go on a long road trip, they try to fill it with a whimsy and a meaning

08:48.400 --> 08:49.680
that just does not exist.

08:49.680 --> 08:54.080
Like they, like as they drive through, they're like, yeah, man, this is life.

08:54.080 --> 08:55.440
This is what it is.

08:55.440 --> 08:57.680
This is the real America.

08:57.680 --> 09:01.680
They, they just watched, they just watched, they just watched Elizabeth town and they

09:01.680 --> 09:05.680
like want every single stop to be like, oh, this is so steeped in history.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.680
I'll be changed because of this.

09:07.680 --> 09:13.120
And I really think that the, the, the, the wheels come off of that wagon really quickly

09:13.120 --> 09:17.760
when you do drive through, say in Oklahoma and you're like, oh, it's 115 degrees here

09:17.760 --> 09:18.880
and I haven't seen a tree.

09:20.240 --> 09:21.120
I want to die.

09:21.120 --> 09:21.760
I want to die.

09:21.760 --> 09:22.800
I probably will.

09:22.800 --> 09:26.160
I mean, I don't, I've never done such a long one.

09:26.160 --> 09:31.200
I mean, my, my typical advice is always just, just the easy stuff.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.920
Like get a book on your phone.

09:34.880 --> 09:35.920
No, she's driving.

09:35.920 --> 09:36.960
She can't do that at all.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.160
That's a horrible advice.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.120
I said on your phone, like get an odd book.

09:41.120 --> 09:41.680
Okay.

09:41.680 --> 09:43.600
I thought you meant like getting an ear.

09:43.600 --> 09:46.240
That cuts, that cuts down on the whimsy.

09:46.240 --> 09:47.040
You know what I'm saying?

09:47.040 --> 09:53.200
Like you can't really appreciate, you can't soak in America and life and this American

09:53.200 --> 09:57.840
life if you're listening to, you know, the new Grisham, it's hard for you to roll the

09:57.840 --> 10:01.440
window down and put your hand out the window and do that, like do that snake thing and

10:01.440 --> 10:05.760
just like, let your hair blow one with the fucking road.

10:06.320 --> 10:10.240
You know, you can't do that when John Rhys Davies is in your ear.

10:10.240 --> 10:11.600
Just like telling you how it is.

10:13.600 --> 10:16.640
Well, what, I mean, what preach it Jim Dale, let's do this.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.600
Should we, man, I, I do miss Maury.

10:21.600 --> 10:24.080
I wish I had my Maury to spend Tuesdays with.

10:24.080 --> 10:24.960
This is a good book.

10:25.840 --> 10:27.680
Wait, oh fuck, I'm here already.

10:27.680 --> 10:29.600
That I, that was convenient.

10:29.600 --> 10:33.840
See, this is why I recommend podcasts instead of the books because I get caught up in the

10:33.840 --> 10:37.200
book and I'm like, but what's going to happen to Harry?

10:37.200 --> 10:39.120
And then all of a sudden I'm swerving all over the road.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.920
What, how, how into this book are you?

10:42.640 --> 10:46.240
Well, whenever I, whenever I listened to the book on tape version of the novelization

10:46.240 --> 10:49.440
of Harry and the Hendersons, I get pretty into it.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.480
Don't punch him again.

10:52.480 --> 10:56.320
He just wants to live with you and be a family and love.

10:56.320 --> 10:56.720
Damn it.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.560
Novelized version of John Lithgow.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.440
He just wants to stay with it.

11:01.440 --> 11:02.720
Oh, I'm in a holiday inn.

11:02.720 --> 11:03.520
Just drove into it.

11:03.520 --> 11:03.840
Fuck.

11:03.840 --> 11:05.760
Just drove into the building.

11:05.760 --> 11:06.640
I'm in the pool.

11:06.640 --> 11:07.840
God damn it.

11:07.840 --> 11:09.200
Wait, there's John Lithgow.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.480
That's John.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.480
John, you're not going to believe this man.

11:12.480 --> 11:20.800
Listen, how's your fish?

11:20.800 --> 11:21.920
Oh yeah, it's a fish.

11:21.920 --> 11:22.720
Something expensive.

11:23.440 --> 11:29.040
Really your two options are whimsy, but that's going to require a lot of work.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.320
A lot of suspension and disbelief.

11:30.320 --> 11:32.240
A lot of prepro, a lot of yelping.

11:32.240 --> 11:37.200
A lot of yelping or total turn your mind off.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.280
Just like distraction.

11:39.280 --> 11:43.280
It's like sleeping, but you have to be awake to do it.

11:44.080 --> 11:46.160
You have to zone out so hard.

11:46.160 --> 11:49.440
And there are podcasts that will do that for you.

11:49.440 --> 11:50.640
Prairie Home Companion.

11:52.320 --> 11:55.040
It might be a great horrible, horrible posture thing.

11:55.040 --> 11:57.760
I do when I'm driving by myself on a long stretch of road.

11:58.640 --> 12:01.680
Set the cruise control and I'll sit cross legged.

12:01.680 --> 12:02.960
Oh God, Travis.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.160
Travis, you really do that?

12:05.360 --> 12:08.320
Not that I haven't done it in a long time because I haven't been on like a big.

12:08.320 --> 12:10.160
But like when you're driving back from Oklahoma,

12:10.160 --> 12:16.560
there are literally like 40, 50 miles of straight nothing road.

12:16.560 --> 12:20.800
Like you don't see another car for half hour, 45 minutes at a time.

12:20.800 --> 12:26.640
But trade off, it takes you 30 car lengths to stop your vehicle.

12:26.640 --> 12:29.200
That is a little, you set your cruise control.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.240
You get a little shut eye.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.720
This person stopped in front of me.

12:32.720 --> 12:33.920
I got to hold on.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.120
Wait, I need to.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.840
I was doing yoga.

12:37.840 --> 12:38.400
Charlie Horse.

12:38.400 --> 12:38.960
Charlie Horse.

12:42.640 --> 12:48.000
Is there anything scarier than accidentally falling asleep behind the wheel?

12:48.800 --> 12:52.160
And not realize, is this not a thing that you guys have done?

12:52.160 --> 12:52.720
Oh yeah.

12:53.520 --> 12:55.280
I just feel really alive afterwards though.

12:56.080 --> 12:57.440
I drive, like don't do it.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.280
Like it was the stupidest thing I've ever done.

12:59.840 --> 13:03.120
I tried to drive back from Bonnaroo the day that it ended.

13:03.120 --> 13:06.720
So I was still like floating on opium and no, that's a joke.

13:06.720 --> 13:07.920
Opium is a body.

13:07.920 --> 13:13.920
Body just coursing with American cigarettes, tobacco, American spirits, great tobacco.

13:13.920 --> 13:22.480
Just American spirits and opium and some sort of, it was like a black oil and I drank it.

13:22.480 --> 13:24.320
What do you mean oil?

13:24.320 --> 13:26.000
I guess it was just, it might've just been oil.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.480
But a man gave it to me and he called it spirit water.

13:29.440 --> 13:32.160
Anyway, I was just rolling, I was floating on spirit water.

13:32.160 --> 13:36.640
I was floating on spirit water and had a van full of people and I was like,

13:36.640 --> 13:37.840
all right, time to go home.

13:37.840 --> 13:41.360
And I drove the seven hours back from Tennessee to West Virginia overnight.

13:42.160 --> 13:46.160
And I would just like, I would just like be driving.

13:46.800 --> 13:50.320
And then all of a sudden I would hit a rumble strip

13:50.320 --> 13:54.320
and realize that I was in a different state than I was a second ago.

13:54.320 --> 13:54.880
Jesus.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.080
That's terrifying.

13:56.080 --> 14:00.160
And I did, but I couldn't have been asleep the whole time, right?

14:00.160 --> 14:02.240
Cause I'm talking about entire state jumping.

14:02.800 --> 14:08.800
I'm talking about, it must've been some sort of, some sort of twilight region

14:08.800 --> 14:11.040
between sleep and awakeness.

14:11.040 --> 14:11.840
Anyway.

14:11.840 --> 14:14.320
There was a long period of time when I worked in Charleston

14:14.320 --> 14:16.960
and I was driving an hour to work and an hour back.

14:16.960 --> 14:20.240
And there would be times that I would leave work and suddenly be at home.

14:21.040 --> 14:23.600
And like, I couldn't tell you anything.

14:23.600 --> 14:24.640
How did this happen?

14:25.520 --> 14:26.720
There was no whimsy.

14:26.720 --> 14:30.800
Well, I meant for this to be such a whimsical return trip

14:30.800 --> 14:35.040
and instead I'm home and oh no, it was all a dream.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.080
I'm dead and in heaven.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.120
I think it might be a really great opportunity.

14:39.120 --> 14:44.480
Just what if you could spend the entire time with no stimulus?

14:45.120 --> 14:48.480
Just spend it thinking about everything and just clearing it.

14:48.480 --> 14:50.800
Oh, put some tape over the clock.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.440
Yeah, just clear it out completely.

14:53.440 --> 14:55.520
Put some tape over the windshield even.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.040
Need some mushrooms.

14:57.600 --> 14:58.400
No, not that.

14:58.400 --> 15:01.200
That's kind of stimulating.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.920
I mean, just watch Fantasia 2000.

15:03.920 --> 15:04.400
Go down.

15:04.400 --> 15:08.640
Just get in there, get a broom and just unpack your adjectives, you know?

15:08.640 --> 15:10.240
Just sweep it all out.

15:10.240 --> 15:10.800
Yeah.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.720
Get everything that's been on your mind out.

15:12.720 --> 15:14.160
Figure out where you are going.

15:14.160 --> 15:16.480
By the end of it, you'll be Maury.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.920
You don't need to spend two days with him anymore because you'll be him.

15:19.920 --> 15:24.560
I think I would eat my own arm in this scenario that you have described.

15:24.560 --> 15:25.760
All right, fine.

15:25.760 --> 15:27.200
Just for something to do?

15:28.240 --> 15:29.280
Just for the novelty?

15:30.400 --> 15:32.800
I have two arms now, I want to be like with one arm.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.320
This will be whimsical.

15:34.320 --> 15:35.680
Do you want a Yahoo answer?

15:35.680 --> 15:36.160
I do.

15:36.160 --> 15:37.600
It was sent in by Ethan Booker.

15:37.600 --> 15:38.400
Thanks, Ethan.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.680
It's about Yahoo Answers user Jamal who asks,

15:41.680 --> 15:49.360
What was the goal of Al-Qaeda in their assassination of Dale Earnhardt?

15:49.360 --> 15:49.840
Oh, no.

15:49.840 --> 15:50.320
What?

15:50.320 --> 15:55.760
In February 2001, members of Al-Qaeda tested their infiltration skills on American soil

15:55.760 --> 16:00.720
by sabotaging the race car of Dale Earnhardt Sr., which ultimately resulted in his death.

16:01.520 --> 16:05.920
Several reliable sources indicate that this was an attempt to destroy the country's morale

16:05.920 --> 16:08.720
in the months before the planned 9-11 attacks.

16:08.720 --> 16:13.440
However, it's common knowledge that most U.S. citizens do not watch NASCAR.

16:13.440 --> 16:17.440
If so, what was Al-Qaeda's motivation for killing Dale Earnhardt?

16:18.480 --> 16:23.840
Okay, first and foremost, disclaimer, Dale Earnhardt was a perfectly fine human being

16:23.840 --> 16:25.360
and it's a tragedy of his loss.

16:25.360 --> 16:26.320
What the fuck?

16:27.200 --> 16:29.520
I mean, I think everyone knew that.

16:29.520 --> 16:31.200
We don't have to, we're just telling people.

16:31.200 --> 16:35.520
Yeah, but I'm probably going to launch into my anti-Dale Earnhardt thing later.

16:35.520 --> 16:38.720
I did not know that you had strong feelings one way or the other towards Earnhardt.

16:38.720 --> 16:40.880
I do not have strong feelings towards Dale Earnhardt.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.720
It sounds like you're about to have them.

16:42.720 --> 16:47.840
Well, I have strong feelings towards the number three never forget and it being everywhere

16:47.840 --> 16:51.920
and like it was a tragedy, but this making him a saint.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.520
I almost lost a job over at once.

16:54.560 --> 16:57.520
I think that, anyways, I don't like NASCAR.

16:57.520 --> 16:59.520
How did you lose a job over here?

16:59.520 --> 17:01.520
I have to know how you almost lost a job.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.040
You can't just leave those breadcrumbs out.

17:03.040 --> 17:03.520
Come on.

17:03.520 --> 17:08.240
No, I brought it up and my boss literally looked at me and said, take it back.

17:08.240 --> 17:09.600
And I said, excuse me.

17:09.600 --> 17:14.320
And he said, I swear to God, take it back or you're fired.

17:14.320 --> 17:16.000
What job was this?

17:16.000 --> 17:23.040
It was when I was working in a shop at OU and I made a joke about how he, oh God, this

17:23.040 --> 17:28.720
is a terrible joke, but I was an asshole in college and I said, all he did was drive a

17:28.720 --> 17:31.040
race car really fast and apparently not that well.

17:31.040 --> 17:33.680
Oh, Travis.

17:33.680 --> 17:38.320
I know, I don't defend the joke now, but is that really something to fire a man over?

17:38.320 --> 17:43.440
I don't think, just cause the man didn't, didn't tweak his bit, you know, like just

17:43.440 --> 17:45.120
cause you didn't punch up the gag.

17:45.120 --> 17:47.520
Oh, wait, was this a comedy improv shop?

17:47.520 --> 17:51.760
I thought I was here to workshop these gags.

17:51.760 --> 17:56.560
I was at the chuckle garage and we were just getting deep into a bit and,

17:56.560 --> 18:02.160
Dale had you hoisted it up, was lubing it.

18:02.160 --> 18:05.280
I was lubing the bit and he was like, hey, apologize.

18:05.280 --> 18:06.560
And so I was like, I'm sorry.

18:06.560 --> 18:08.480
And he was like, that was close.

18:08.480 --> 18:09.480
How?

18:09.480 --> 18:10.480
Thanks man.

18:10.480 --> 18:14.320
If you had an apologist, I don't know what I would have done.

18:14.320 --> 18:18.400
I lose, I entirely lose control of my body and actions.

18:18.400 --> 18:22.800
I start thinking about the intimidator and it's literally, I go black and red.

18:22.800 --> 18:32.160
Literally the next day he came in, in like full like t-shirt, jacket, t-shirt, oh, like

18:32.160 --> 18:34.400
you didn't already fucking know.

18:34.400 --> 18:40.480
Like he had to, uh, like just to really drive the point home, huge Earnhardt fan.

18:40.480 --> 18:44.960
Now listen, you can't apologize to Dale Earnhardt himself.

18:44.960 --> 18:49.520
You're going to either apologize to junior or you're going to apologize to Barry pepper

18:49.520 --> 18:54.600
who played him in the hit sports channel miniseries three.

18:54.600 --> 18:55.600
Apologize to Barry pepper.

18:55.600 --> 18:56.600
Go call up Barry pepper.

18:56.600 --> 18:57.600
Go call up Barry pepper.

18:57.600 --> 18:58.600
I'm sorry Barry pepper.

18:58.600 --> 18:59.600
I'm sorry junior.

18:59.600 --> 19:00.600
I'm so sorry.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.640
I'm sorry Barry pepper.

19:02.640 --> 19:03.640
Now leave me alone.

19:03.640 --> 19:06.640
I'm going to go jerk off with this Benzoil.

19:06.640 --> 19:09.080
God damn it.

19:09.080 --> 19:10.080
This is 530.

19:10.080 --> 19:11.080
This is 530.

19:11.080 --> 19:14.960
I need 400 to get it in there.

19:14.960 --> 19:16.800
I don't like this guy you work for, Travis.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.180
I want to call him.

19:18.180 --> 19:21.960
How awkward is the apology that you have to make to somebody when you make a tasteless

19:21.960 --> 19:23.220
Dale Earnhardt joke?

19:23.220 --> 19:24.220
Because are you?

19:24.220 --> 19:25.220
It was pretty awkward.

19:25.220 --> 19:29.160
Cause we were also like on our backs underneath a platform attaching legs.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.720
So we're going, we're lying next to each other in the dark.

19:31.720 --> 19:34.400
So it was like doubly creepy.

19:34.400 --> 19:35.400
Kind of romantic.

19:35.400 --> 19:38.160
The other thing was it's a dude in theater, right?

19:38.160 --> 19:44.560
Like in no way would I have ever suspected that this was a touchy subject with him prior

19:44.560 --> 19:45.560
to this.

19:45.560 --> 19:46.560
Right.

19:46.560 --> 19:50.280
Cause you were dissing terry cloth bathrobes and small dogs, right?

19:50.280 --> 19:51.280
Yeah.

19:51.280 --> 19:54.280
What are you saying?

19:54.280 --> 19:57.200
Um, oh shit.

19:57.200 --> 20:01.120
Why does, why did I have to, I know we've gone over this, but I have to know why he

20:01.120 --> 20:05.240
demanded an apology and wasn't just like, Oh, that was kind of tasteless.

20:05.240 --> 20:09.600
What does you apologizing to him get him in the long run?

20:09.600 --> 20:11.600
He felt I had crossed the line, I guess.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.280
I don't know what line that was.

20:13.280 --> 20:19.720
Yeah, but he is not a conduit for the Earnhardt estate, you know, he actually was the executor

20:19.720 --> 20:20.940
of the Earnhardt estate.

20:20.940 --> 20:23.720
And I failed to mention that earlier on in the story.

20:23.720 --> 20:24.960
He was Dale Earnhardt jr.

20:24.960 --> 20:26.440
I should have said that.

20:26.440 --> 20:28.120
You have to listen.

20:28.120 --> 20:33.160
If you, if you believe in Dale Earnhardt hard enough, and if that's a big part of your belief

20:33.160 --> 20:37.880
system, then you have to clap your hands and you have to believe that Dale is watching

20:37.880 --> 20:39.360
us all the time.

20:39.360 --> 20:51.080
Dale is watching us, Dale is watching us, Dale is watching us from a distance.

20:51.080 --> 20:55.740
If you don't believe that, that he is always seeing you, that he can see the tasteless

20:55.740 --> 21:00.080
joke you made, that he can see me making fun of Barry Pepper.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.580
He doesn't care for that either.

21:01.580 --> 21:09.800
If you can't believe that Dale is omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, and omnifast, then

21:09.800 --> 21:10.800
what's your belief system?

21:10.800 --> 21:17.320
Travis, how many, Travis, how many Hail Berries did you have to do, uh, after you've created

21:17.320 --> 21:18.320
that sentence?

21:18.320 --> 21:21.560
I'm sorry, it's actually a Hey Barry!

21:21.560 --> 21:23.720
That's what it's called.

21:23.720 --> 21:29.440
When you, when you make a tasteless Dale Earnhardt jr., uh, senior joke, you have to do eight

21:29.440 --> 21:35.800
Hey Berries, and, um, if you say something about how Dale Earnhardt jr. is gonna lose

21:35.800 --> 21:38.200
a race, that's only two Hey Berries!

21:38.200 --> 21:41.680
What, what did Al Qaeda have against him?

21:41.680 --> 21:43.280
You know what they had against him.

21:43.280 --> 21:44.280
What?

21:44.280 --> 21:46.400
Cause he, cause he was so inspirational to us.

21:46.400 --> 21:56.920
He was, this was a man, Justin, who, uh, played by his own rules, changed the rules, uh, there's,

21:56.920 --> 22:05.920
there's something to be said about the immeasurable amount of freedom had by these men who are

22:05.920 --> 22:09.320
only allowed to drive in a circle very carefully.

22:09.320 --> 22:10.320
Right.

22:10.320 --> 22:15.120
Um, and so, they took that sign of freedom, it's like if they had, if they had single-handedly

22:15.120 --> 22:20.760
killed all bald eagles on the planet, uh, that's pretty much what they did when they

22:20.760 --> 22:22.280
killed Dale Earnhardt jr.

22:22.280 --> 22:28.720
I do really like, I like the logic of this theory, which is, they had, so they were planning

22:28.720 --> 22:33.760
9-11, and they said, okay, so that's pretty bad, but what can we do to undermine the morale

22:33.760 --> 22:34.760
of the country?

22:34.760 --> 22:36.760
Cause 9-11's not gonna do it.

22:36.760 --> 22:41.880
It's just a massive miscalculation, I think, if you're sitting in a room planning on 9-11,

22:41.880 --> 22:47.440
and you say, you know, the problem with this plan is it's not gonna make people in red

22:47.440 --> 22:49.720
states hate brown people enough.

22:49.720 --> 22:50.720
Yeah.

22:50.720 --> 22:54.520
They're not gonna, they're not gonna be too upset about it, we really need to dig into

22:54.520 --> 23:00.480
those guys and get like, no, they were, they're gonna be the angriest, like they're gonna

23:00.480 --> 23:06.920
be so angry at anybody who looks like you for the longest time, they're gonna be mad

23:06.920 --> 23:11.680
at like Harry Hamlin, like, it's gonna get bad, okay?

23:11.680 --> 23:17.000
It's gonna get real, they're gonna get, they're gonna get really mad at anybody who even remotely

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
looks like you.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.960
I don't think you need to also kill Dale Earnhardt.

23:20.960 --> 23:25.920
Can you imagine on the day that Dale Earnhardt, Sr. died, being a graphic designer who had

23:25.920 --> 23:29.480
really only nailed down italicized numbers and wings?

23:29.480 --> 23:30.480
Yeah.

23:30.480 --> 23:32.840
Like, it must have been just like the best day for that one guy.

23:32.840 --> 23:33.840
Mhmm.

23:33.840 --> 23:38.360
Especially if he just hooked up with like a plate manufacturer, like, it's so fucking,

23:38.360 --> 23:41.440
ugh, time to print some gold.

23:41.440 --> 23:44.080
Oh, gosh.

23:44.080 --> 23:49.040
I'm sorry, you know, we brought the show down, I feel like.

23:49.040 --> 23:53.560
I feel like, let's, what could cheer, is there any way we could cheer up Griffin?

23:53.560 --> 23:59.040
I know a great way we can cheer up when we can ponder the death of Dale Earnhardt, Sr.

23:59.040 --> 24:03.400
That's to watch Comedy Bang Bang every Friday at 10, 9 central on IFC.

24:03.400 --> 24:07.680
It's an absurd half hour comedy show that only looks like a talk show, it's comedy so

24:07.680 --> 24:10.020
nice, they banged it twice.

24:10.020 --> 24:13.560
With your host Scott Ackerman, a band led by Reggie Watts, and it's got amazing guests

24:13.560 --> 24:17.720
from some of the biggest names in comedy like Amy Poehler, Zach Galifianakis, and Seth Rogen.

24:17.720 --> 24:21.240
So you could catch that and give it a watch.

24:21.240 --> 24:22.240
Give it a watcher.

24:22.240 --> 24:25.680
Hey, I need help overcoming my absent mind in this.

24:25.680 --> 24:32.520
Ever since I was a kid, I've been prone to misplacing things, forgetting, what, what?

24:32.520 --> 24:36.920
I've been prone to misplacing things, forgetting appointments, and suddenly realizing I have

24:36.920 --> 24:39.640
no idea what I came in the room looking for.

24:39.640 --> 24:44.120
Generally, I'm very good natured about it, but now that I'm a young professional with

24:44.120 --> 24:50.080
bills and deadlines, I spend more and more time worried that I'm forgetting something

24:50.080 --> 24:51.080
important.

24:51.080 --> 24:53.840
What can I do to improve my memory and maintain some peace of mind?

24:53.840 --> 24:56.680
That's from Leonard Shelby.

24:56.680 --> 24:59.720
You gotta put it in the cloud.

24:59.720 --> 25:00.920
Is that the key?

25:00.920 --> 25:01.920
I don't know.

25:01.920 --> 25:02.920
Is that like let go and let God?

25:02.920 --> 25:04.240
Yeah, let go and let God.

25:04.240 --> 25:08.000
Jesus take this wheel from me, please.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.880
Jesus take my appointments down.

25:09.880 --> 25:12.000
Jesus is my stenographer.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Got it.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Okay.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.360
Dictated, but not written by Jesus.

25:17.360 --> 25:19.840
So yeah, you got to put it in the cloud.

25:19.840 --> 25:23.320
Keep keep keep E files of everything.

25:23.320 --> 25:27.320
That's what I have to do after the second that anyone tells me I have to put a calendar

25:27.320 --> 25:31.400
to eat breakfast or I forget oatmeal is a thing.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.480
What do you normally end up eating then?

25:33.480 --> 25:34.480
Nothing.

25:34.480 --> 25:35.480
I ended up eating the hunger.

25:35.480 --> 25:38.320
There's a sad realization to make about yourself.

25:38.320 --> 25:41.360
I know got to put it in the cloud.

25:41.360 --> 25:43.880
Is there a what's the name for that?

25:43.880 --> 25:49.200
When you forget something that you're like you walk in a room and you forget what you're

25:49.200 --> 25:50.200
going to be doing in the room.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.920
There's a there's an idiom for it in another country.

25:52.920 --> 25:53.920
Does anyone know?

25:53.920 --> 25:54.920
Forgetful?

25:54.920 --> 25:55.920
Fushigi.

25:55.920 --> 25:56.920
Fushigi.

25:56.920 --> 25:58.240
Oh, man.

25:58.240 --> 26:00.280
I went a whole week without practicing Fushigi.

26:00.280 --> 26:02.160
That's the real human cost of my life.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.520
Can I tell you something though?

26:03.520 --> 26:04.520
What?

26:04.520 --> 26:06.960
You can put that shit in the cloud.

26:06.960 --> 26:07.960
That's true.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.960
I could have been working with it in the cloud for the whole week.

26:09.960 --> 26:14.840
I could have been I could have had my Johnny Mnemonic virtual reality gloves on and I could

26:14.840 --> 26:18.020
have been manipulating my Fushigi during my mini break.

26:18.020 --> 26:22.080
And you still schedule breaks would not have been the nerdiest looking person at either

26:22.080 --> 26:23.560
Max von Connery 3.

26:23.560 --> 26:27.040
You know what I do to help remember things?

26:27.040 --> 26:28.040
What's that?

26:28.040 --> 26:29.040
It's not a joke.

26:29.040 --> 26:32.620
I'm really bad about setting things down in random places like without thinking.

26:32.620 --> 26:37.440
And then when I go to look for it later, it's like on top of the refrigerator or in a drawer

26:37.440 --> 26:39.400
in my kitchen or something.

26:39.400 --> 26:44.240
I loudly announce exactly what I'm doing whenever I set something down.

26:44.240 --> 26:45.240
No, you don't.

26:45.240 --> 26:46.240
I do too.

26:46.240 --> 26:47.240
No way.

26:47.240 --> 26:49.680
When I'm at work and I need to like I'm putting my keys down.

26:49.680 --> 26:55.120
I'll say like I'm putting them in this chair.

26:55.120 --> 26:59.880
I do because I have at work because I work in a very large theater.

26:59.880 --> 27:04.560
I will put my keys down somewhere and then when it's time to leave, we will spend forty

27:04.560 --> 27:07.340
five minutes looking for where I put my keys down.

27:07.340 --> 27:10.240
So this way I just announce where I'm putting them down.

27:10.240 --> 27:12.880
And so when I say where did I put my keys?

27:12.880 --> 27:15.600
Everyone that was in the room will say you put them in that chair.

27:15.600 --> 27:21.000
Now listen, I know I know sometimes I get a little overzealous about Dale Earnhardt,

27:21.000 --> 27:26.280
but I work with a guy who announces every goddamn thing he does today.

27:26.280 --> 27:30.080
He said, I'm eating my twenty seventh bite of this muffin.

27:30.080 --> 27:32.560
I'm eating my twenty eighth bite of the muffin.

27:32.560 --> 27:34.280
Is it I'm throwing the wrapper away.

27:34.280 --> 27:39.280
Is it possible, Travis, that you are actually being haunted by the mischievous specter of

27:39.280 --> 27:43.840
Dale Earnhardt Senior because of your tasteless comedy, Goofs, and he just moves your things

27:43.840 --> 27:45.480
around on you?

27:45.480 --> 27:46.920
Is it possible?

27:46.920 --> 27:48.960
Is it is it likely?

27:48.960 --> 27:50.560
Yes.

27:50.560 --> 27:53.840
Is it 100 percent certain exactly what's happening?

27:53.840 --> 27:57.040
Every culture has its own Dale Earnhardt.

27:57.040 --> 28:00.480
Some people call him the Sasquatch, some the Yeti.

28:00.480 --> 28:07.520
In Japan, Dale Earnhardt fills his children's shoes with motor oil if they have been bad.

28:07.520 --> 28:10.480
If they have been good, he leaves them a koozie.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.120
Hello, Ricky.

28:13.120 --> 28:16.360
Have you been good this year?

28:16.360 --> 28:21.960
I'm going to leave you a koozie filled with Skoal tobacco products.

28:21.960 --> 28:24.080
This is the kooziest Christmas.

28:24.080 --> 28:25.460
This is the kooziest.

28:25.460 --> 28:31.440
You know, every child in Whoville had no koozies, yet Christmas came anyway.

28:31.440 --> 28:34.280
Someone had stolen all the koozies.

28:34.280 --> 28:41.460
That is my favorite rank and bass animated series when the Japanese specter of Dale Earnhardt

28:41.460 --> 28:48.800
has to travel across the globe and recapture the koozies that the evil insert other race

28:48.800 --> 28:54.040
car driver's name here has stolen from around the globe.

28:54.040 --> 28:56.760
Jeff Gordon, is he still on the pro circuit?

28:56.760 --> 28:57.760
We could do Jeff Gordon.

28:57.760 --> 28:58.760
Yeah.

28:58.760 --> 28:59.760
Yeah.

28:59.760 --> 29:00.760
Remember me?

29:00.760 --> 29:01.760
Known for being an evil koozie thief.

29:01.760 --> 29:02.920
Jeff Gordon is the perfect thief.

29:02.920 --> 29:06.760
Jeff Gordon hates fresh and cold beverages.

29:06.760 --> 29:16.320
Koozies and oil, koozies and oil, mean so much more when I see that black liquid filling

29:16.320 --> 29:22.160
up koozies under racing Christmas trees.

29:22.160 --> 29:31.400
Other countries are much weirder than ours when it comes to holidays, I think.

29:31.400 --> 29:33.640
You got to respect it, though.

29:33.640 --> 29:34.640
You got to respect it.

29:34.640 --> 29:35.640
Oh, Christ.

29:35.640 --> 29:36.640
Did you ask it?

29:36.640 --> 29:37.640
Maybe the guy was Japanese, Travis.

29:37.640 --> 29:40.640
Did you ask if he was Japanese?

29:40.640 --> 29:43.440
Maybe that was the problem.

29:43.440 --> 29:45.560
No goof I can make here won't be racist.

29:45.560 --> 29:47.640
I want to move on, please.

29:47.640 --> 29:53.200
We've entered into this weird Venn diagram of racism where redneck people and Japanese

29:53.200 --> 29:55.200
people cross over.

29:55.200 --> 29:57.400
Oh, Christ.

29:57.400 --> 30:03.240
So yeah.

30:03.240 --> 30:10.200
This is goofy, but I take a... This is really goofy, actually, but I'll take a picture.

30:10.200 --> 30:15.400
I'll make my fingers like a frame and then take a mind picture of something.

30:15.400 --> 30:19.160
If I need to remember where it is, do you say like click?

30:19.160 --> 30:21.600
No, I'm not like a crazy person.

30:21.600 --> 30:25.720
I just take the mind picture and then I'll remember like, oh, okay, I put this down here

30:25.720 --> 30:27.720
so I don't forget it.

30:27.720 --> 30:29.880
That's a whimsical thing that you can do on a car drive.

30:29.880 --> 30:33.320
It's just like snap pics, make a little frame with your hand.

30:33.320 --> 30:37.240
It's hard to Instagram them, though.

30:37.240 --> 30:47.720
You know what really makes me super mad is the fact that my memory is selective, but

30:47.720 --> 30:50.120
also really shitty.

30:50.120 --> 30:53.200
It's shitty about the things that it selects to remember.

30:53.200 --> 30:58.400
I can't remember to eat my oatmeal in the morning, but I can remember the password to

30:58.400 --> 31:05.920
Mega Man 2 that is saved right before you've finished all of the Robot Masters except for

31:05.920 --> 31:07.520
Quick Man.

31:07.520 --> 31:13.820
I can remember the exact pattern that password is, but I cannot remember my dad's phone number

31:13.820 --> 31:16.420
if I need to in case of emergency.

31:16.420 --> 31:20.400
I've learned over the last couple of days in communicating with one of my new Max Funcon

31:20.400 --> 31:27.080
friends, Rhea Butcher, that I can tell you every tertiary character in Back to the Future

31:27.080 --> 31:34.360
1, 2, and 3, but I cannot tell you the names of most people I met at Max Funcon.

31:34.360 --> 31:37.920
Which is a shame, because we kept seeing them over and over again.

31:37.920 --> 31:40.080
And they wore name tags.

31:40.080 --> 31:43.400
They wore basically little things that said, hey, stupid, this is my name.

31:43.400 --> 31:47.800
Travis actually couldn't remember their names in the time it took his eyes to travel from

31:47.800 --> 31:50.720
their name tags to their eyes, so it was pretty humiliating.

31:50.720 --> 31:53.080
He had to do this quick up and down dance.

31:53.080 --> 31:56.720
It looked like he was just nodding very intently, but actually he was just like, Jeff, okay,

31:56.720 --> 31:57.720
Jeff.

31:57.720 --> 31:58.720
Fuck!

31:58.720 --> 31:59.720
Hold on.

31:59.720 --> 32:00.720
I've gotten really good at heyduting.

32:00.720 --> 32:01.720
Yeah.

32:01.720 --> 32:02.720
Hey, bud.

32:02.720 --> 32:06.520
No, actually, heyduting is where you pretend to be one of the characters from the Nickelodeon

32:06.520 --> 32:07.520
show Hey Dude.

32:07.520 --> 32:08.520
Preferably Ted.

32:08.520 --> 32:09.520
Yeah, sure.

32:09.520 --> 32:10.520
Hi.

32:10.520 --> 32:11.520
My name is Melody.

32:11.520 --> 32:12.520
Hi, I'm Ted.

32:12.520 --> 32:16.840
Did you see how Travis actually just set up that conversation with a plan to sabotage

32:16.840 --> 32:17.840
it?

32:17.840 --> 32:18.840
Thank you.

32:18.840 --> 32:23.560
Thank you for appreciating the prep of the goof.

32:23.560 --> 32:26.560
I wish- What's up, girl?

32:26.560 --> 32:30.280
I just wish I could remember things better, or I wish I could remember more practical

32:30.280 --> 32:35.400
things, because it is almost never that I can impress somebody with my Mega Man 2 password

32:35.400 --> 32:36.400
knowledge.

32:36.400 --> 32:40.720
I actually, whenever I have something I have to remember, I feel like I'm racing against

32:40.720 --> 32:44.520
time until I can put it in my phone as a reminder.

32:44.520 --> 32:46.840
I shit you not, I agree.

32:46.840 --> 32:47.840
You got to have buckets.

32:47.840 --> 32:52.360
I mean, that's the only thing that I can tell you is buckets for... I use a service called

32:52.360 --> 32:58.440
Remember the Milk, which is a... It's in the cloud.

32:58.440 --> 33:04.800
It is just a big to-do list that is parsed out with different areas of your life.

33:04.800 --> 33:08.880
When I have something I know I need to do, the only time I can breathe easy is when I'm

33:08.880 --> 33:12.160
like race... Is when I can actually type it in to Remember the Milk.

33:12.160 --> 33:13.720
It's like, okay, got it.

33:13.720 --> 33:14.720
That's in there.

33:14.720 --> 33:19.640
I don't have to worry about it anymore, but until then, I can't leave the room.

33:19.640 --> 33:21.040
I can't stand up.

33:21.040 --> 33:25.200
My brain won't hold on to it for more than 20 seconds, and then it'll just be gone forever.

33:25.200 --> 33:26.200
That's a problem.

33:26.200 --> 33:30.280
There's a memento where you blink your eyes, or you look away and look back, and it's gone.

33:30.280 --> 33:34.440
I will sit here and say to myself, don't forget to grab that bag on the way out the door.

33:34.440 --> 33:36.880
Don't forget to grab that bag on the way out the door.

33:36.880 --> 33:41.200
Then if I turn and do something else, I'm out the door and I've left the bag, unless

33:41.200 --> 33:43.040
I do it in that second.

33:43.040 --> 33:48.280
That's the problem with the cloud is that I'll be on a bus playing Chrono Trigger,

33:48.280 --> 33:52.200
and I'll be like, I'm going to check my email, and so I go back to the home screen, and then

33:52.200 --> 33:56.640
I see my cloud, and I'm like, oh shit, I haven't been in my cloud in a while, and I'll go in

33:56.640 --> 34:00.080
and I'll be like, oh fuck, I was supposed to pick Billy up from his locker practice

34:00.080 --> 34:01.080
two and a half weeks ago.

34:01.080 --> 34:04.800
I put it in the cloud, but I forgot to go back in the cloud.

34:04.800 --> 34:06.520
Now he's just a cute little skeleton.

34:06.520 --> 34:10.640
Now I have a tattoo of a cloud on the back of my hands, so I know.

34:10.640 --> 34:11.640
Just peep the cloud.

34:11.640 --> 34:14.400
So I guess that's good advice, just do everything right away.

34:14.400 --> 34:15.400
Don't wait.

34:15.400 --> 34:18.280
Or just eat some ginkgo biloba, or be fucking smarter than we are.

34:18.280 --> 34:22.080
Yeah, that would be good if you could figure out what combinations of supplements you

34:22.080 --> 34:23.840
need to take to remember shit.

34:23.840 --> 34:28.240
Now, this is going to sound like a goof, but I've actually always wondered this, because

34:28.240 --> 34:32.400
they always have it in movies and TV shows, like professional business people have personal

34:32.400 --> 34:34.120
assistants.

34:34.120 --> 34:39.520
Is that a real thing that you can just hire someone to do, or do you have to be a signed

34:39.520 --> 34:40.520
one at a business?

34:40.520 --> 34:44.120
I make the internet my personal assistant.

34:44.120 --> 34:47.480
By which I mean, I'll get on Twitter and be like, hey Twitter, in like a half hour, can

34:47.480 --> 34:49.360
you remind me to take my vitamins?

34:49.360 --> 34:52.440
And how's that working out for you?

34:52.440 --> 34:53.440
Not very well.

34:53.440 --> 34:54.440
Not well.

34:54.440 --> 34:58.200
I'll get a tweet like a half hour later, but it's like, suck my dick.

34:58.200 --> 35:01.800
And I'm like, that's, I don't think that's what I was supposed to do.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.920
But I didn't need any vitamin dick.

35:03.920 --> 35:04.920
Yeah.

35:04.920 --> 35:09.920
Let's go to the money zone.

35:09.920 --> 35:20.660
What was that, chuckles the clown?

35:20.660 --> 35:23.960
This message is for Cara Joy Chapman.

35:23.960 --> 35:30.020
She's at Chapman Cara on Twitter, and it's from Israel Johnson.

35:30.020 --> 35:31.020
They're best friends.

35:31.020 --> 35:35.400
She's a college student, future coolest elementary school teacher ever been listening since episode

35:35.400 --> 35:40.040
three and got me into the show for my episode 11.

35:40.040 --> 35:43.860
Last year we went to the Cincy live show for her birthday where she got that poster Justin

35:43.860 --> 35:46.720
mentioned in her Twitter profile pic.

35:46.720 --> 35:49.080
She's turning 20 June 13th.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.360
Happy birthday, best friend.

35:51.360 --> 35:58.840
Love Israel at the monster truck rally this Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, one man against the

35:58.840 --> 35:59.840
world.

35:59.840 --> 36:04.280
Four wheels, hot rod, birthday, birthday.

36:04.280 --> 36:07.640
The ghost of Dale Earnhardt poster.

36:07.640 --> 36:13.640
The Japanese ghost of Dale Earnhardt in Cara Chapman's birthday.

36:13.640 --> 36:18.920
First hundred kids who've been good all year through the door get a koozie supply by Japanese

36:18.920 --> 36:21.920
Dale Earnhardt's ghost.

36:21.920 --> 36:22.920
Happy birthday, Cara.

36:22.920 --> 36:23.920
Happy birthday, Cara.

36:23.920 --> 36:32.660
I want to tell you guys about an album, a musical album on Bandcamp by Red Sky Phenomenon.

36:32.660 --> 36:37.920
It's an album that is entirely made on a Nintendo DS using the Korg DS 10, which is a Nintendo

36:37.920 --> 36:43.240
DS game that is sort of an emulator of the Korg synthesizer.

36:43.240 --> 36:46.360
The album's named Your Own Price, meaning you can get it for a buck or two or you can

36:46.360 --> 36:52.280
get it for free and you can check it out at Red Sky Phenomenon dot Bandcamp dot com.

36:52.280 --> 36:57.400
Wait a minute, this guy just played DS for an hour and yours was giving money for it?

36:57.400 --> 37:00.600
He played Pokemon Platinum and he recorded it.

37:00.600 --> 37:01.600
He recorded the sounds.

37:01.600 --> 37:04.960
You can get a video of me playing Pokemon for two hours.

37:04.960 --> 37:09.440
God, I would probably do that.

37:09.440 --> 37:10.440
You would buy that?

37:10.440 --> 37:11.440
I probably would, yeah.

37:11.440 --> 37:15.960
I like seeing how people develop their tactics and which Pokemons they go on.

37:15.960 --> 37:18.000
God damn it, you've got a problem.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
You've got a serious problem.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.160
I like to be the best.

37:21.160 --> 37:24.600
This podcast is supported by Bing, making search social.

37:24.600 --> 37:28.600
Use Bing to include results from both the web at large and also social media sites like

37:28.600 --> 37:33.680
Facebook and Twitter, pulling content from your own friends and from the experts.

37:33.680 --> 37:35.760
More online at Bing dot com.

37:35.760 --> 37:37.720
Bing is for doing.

37:37.720 --> 37:39.200
For doing what?

37:39.200 --> 37:40.200
It.

37:40.200 --> 37:41.200
It.

37:41.200 --> 37:42.680
It's for doing it?

37:42.680 --> 37:43.680
Yeah.

37:43.680 --> 37:44.680
I love Bing.

37:44.680 --> 37:48.160
I don't think they want their message to read like that.

37:48.160 --> 37:50.960
Bing is for doing magic.

37:50.960 --> 37:53.920
You know with some of the sponsors we have on the show, they like it when we get silly

37:53.920 --> 37:54.920
with it.

37:54.920 --> 37:56.480
I'm not sure Bing wants us to get silly.

37:56.480 --> 37:57.480
Bing is for riffing.

37:57.480 --> 37:59.760
What if I said, uh.

37:59.760 --> 38:00.760
It's yours for friendship.

38:00.760 --> 38:04.000
What if I said, I'm trying to Bing tonight.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.520
What if I said, hold on, wait, let me try this.

38:07.520 --> 38:10.440
You know what my favorite character from Friends is?

38:10.440 --> 38:11.440
Shandler Google.

38:11.440 --> 38:13.240
No, wait, that's not it.

38:13.240 --> 38:15.480
Okay, this is pretty good.

38:15.480 --> 38:20.560
This is a good, now, listen, seriously guys, I don't think Bing wants their corporate message

38:20.560 --> 38:22.600
chopped and screwed in that special way.

38:22.600 --> 38:23.600
The only way to do it.

38:23.600 --> 38:24.600
Okay, how about this?

38:24.600 --> 38:25.600
How about this?

38:25.600 --> 38:27.960
Bing wants to like read these things and then dip out.

38:27.960 --> 38:28.960
We read it.

38:28.960 --> 38:31.240
I'm just saying that Google has been horseshit lately.

38:31.240 --> 38:33.360
I don't know what they do anymore.

38:33.360 --> 38:41.680
Yeah, they spend all their time making goofy logos and then what the fuck?

38:41.680 --> 38:42.680
I don't even get those logos.

38:42.680 --> 38:43.680
I don't even get search results anymore.

38:43.680 --> 38:44.680
How about this?

38:44.680 --> 38:46.880
I search something like, I don't know, both.

38:46.880 --> 38:47.880
How about this?

38:47.880 --> 38:53.120
Bing, colon, because Google sucks now and what else are you going to use, Alta Vista,

38:53.120 --> 38:54.120
dummy?

38:54.120 --> 38:56.680
Chaps, do you want to tell us about this next thing?

38:56.680 --> 38:57.680
Sure.

38:57.680 --> 38:58.680
Smooth.

38:58.680 --> 39:03.360
So, there's a, once again, we've got another Kickstarter and I tell you what, this one

39:03.360 --> 39:04.360
looks awesome.

39:04.360 --> 39:10.360
Basically, we're looking to support word realms and so I'm sure everyone knows Kingdom of

39:10.360 --> 39:11.360
Loathing.

39:11.360 --> 39:12.360
Oh yeah.

39:12.360 --> 39:13.720
The incredible stick figure game.

39:13.720 --> 39:19.240
This is from the people that brought you Kingdom of Loathing and so think Words with Friends

39:19.240 --> 39:25.720
if it was an RPG fighting game and basically, through the construction of words using word

39:25.720 --> 39:31.440
tiles, you're able to do attacks and stuff and it looks just incredible and they describe

39:31.440 --> 39:37.040
it as fisticuffs scrabble, which is basically like the best thing I've ever heard.

39:37.040 --> 39:44.680
The single person version is already finished and it can be yours for just $11 for a Kickstarter

39:44.680 --> 39:46.000
donation.

39:46.000 --> 39:51.200
There's only 11 days left on the Kickstarter, so make sure you go to wordrealms.com and

39:51.200 --> 39:53.680
check it out now before it's too late.

39:53.680 --> 39:55.000
Trust me, you won't regret it.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
It looks incredible.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.240
Sounds really neat.

39:57.240 --> 40:04.520
I get down on RPGs and word games and this sounds like a nice collabo of those two.

40:04.520 --> 40:06.960
Yeah, so go check it out now before it's too late.

40:06.960 --> 40:10.840
There's only 11 days left, so don't wait.

40:10.840 --> 40:18.640
So for Bing, what if Bing, what if it was just like, Bing.

40:18.640 --> 40:19.640
That's good.

40:19.640 --> 40:20.640
And that's the whole thing.

40:20.640 --> 40:21.640
Oh, that's nice.

40:21.640 --> 40:22.640
BONG!

40:22.640 --> 40:23.640
Nope, nope, you blew it.

40:23.640 --> 40:24.640
BING!

40:24.640 --> 40:25.640
There it is.

40:25.640 --> 40:33.880
So that's my Bing joke.

40:33.880 --> 40:42.560
I wish I could just make the jingle for the Korg album Pokemon, like me playing Pokemon

40:42.560 --> 40:43.560
on my Nintendo.

40:43.560 --> 40:44.560
Why can't you do that?

40:44.560 --> 40:45.560
I can, actually.

40:45.560 --> 40:55.480
Griffin, can you just sing along with the theme?

40:55.480 --> 40:56.480
Yeah.

40:56.480 --> 40:58.840
Money's own.

40:58.840 --> 41:03.160
This time is for Red Sky Phenomenon.

41:03.160 --> 41:08.880
He made an album on the Korg DS-10.

41:08.880 --> 41:14.240
It's like Pokemon with less Pokemon.

41:14.240 --> 41:17.040
Everybody's got to pick it up.

41:17.040 --> 41:19.160
Nobody likes Fleet Foxes anymore.

41:19.160 --> 41:22.480
Fill the Fleet Foxes void.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.280
I think that's all I got.

41:24.280 --> 41:25.520
It's hard to sing along with this version.

41:25.520 --> 41:27.520
This is like the Chop and Screwed remix.

41:27.520 --> 41:30.480
Sounds like somebody losing their mind.

41:30.480 --> 41:36.760
I hear you saying that, and I instinctively want to give you three dollars and ask if

41:36.760 --> 41:39.280
I can take you to the nearest shelter.

41:39.280 --> 41:40.280
WordRealms.com.

41:40.280 --> 41:43.000
I need help.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.160
Can you have some soup?

41:45.160 --> 41:46.720
I live on soup.

41:46.720 --> 41:48.440
I live on the streets.

41:48.440 --> 41:50.160
I fight with words.

41:50.160 --> 41:58.080
I yell at the dogs at night.

41:58.080 --> 41:59.080
Is that audio coming?

41:59.080 --> 42:00.080
How are my levels?

42:00.080 --> 42:01.080
Is that audio coming through at all?

42:01.080 --> 42:02.080
It's good levels.

42:02.080 --> 42:03.080
So visit those places.

42:03.080 --> 42:05.320
The speaker on the Game Boy Micro, it's surprisingly-

42:05.320 --> 42:06.320
Dang it.

42:06.320 --> 42:07.320
Yeah.

42:07.320 --> 42:10.320
Well, this is all I'm doing now during the show.

42:10.320 --> 42:12.200
Griffin, put it down.

42:12.200 --> 42:13.200
Put it down.

42:13.200 --> 42:14.200
Okay.

42:14.200 --> 42:15.200
All right.

42:15.200 --> 42:16.200
I'm going to put it down.

42:16.200 --> 42:20.400
Griffin, I can hear you playing the game.

42:20.400 --> 42:22.360
Do you guys want a Yahoo answer?

42:22.360 --> 42:23.360
Yes.

42:23.360 --> 42:24.360
Yeah.

42:24.360 --> 42:26.200
This one was sent in by Josh Papow.

42:26.200 --> 42:32.840
I haven't decided if it's the kind of question that we could get in trouble for reading yet.

42:32.840 --> 42:33.840
Okay.

42:33.840 --> 42:34.840
Yay.

42:34.840 --> 42:35.840
Yay.

42:35.840 --> 42:36.840
Thank you, Josh.

42:36.840 --> 42:37.840
It's about Yahoo Answers.

42:37.840 --> 42:40.440
Here's your question, Mark, who asked, really freaked out my girlfriend.

42:40.440 --> 42:41.440
Need help?

42:41.440 --> 42:47.200
As a teenager, I suffered from severe depression and formed a strong bond with the character

42:47.200 --> 42:52.360
Garfield and his outlook.

42:52.360 --> 42:56.120
It's sad, but reading Garfield anthologies obsessively was the only thing that made me

42:56.120 --> 43:01.080
feel normal, and it eventually took on something of an erotic fixation.

43:01.080 --> 43:03.960
Oh, no.

43:03.960 --> 43:11.440
I think you mispronounced normal.

43:11.440 --> 43:15.760
Reading Garfield books obsessively made me feel normal.

43:15.760 --> 43:20.880
To avoid feeling like a sicko, I drew pictures of Garfield with a woman's, I think a Pamela

43:20.880 --> 43:30.640
Anderson circa 1991, body and Garfield's head so that I was assured that my fixation wasn't

43:30.640 --> 43:34.040
with animals or repressed homosexuality.

43:34.040 --> 43:41.080
This Garfield-Pam hybrid still had the same biting wit and acerbic outlook and tended

43:41.080 --> 43:45.640
to cut herself in self-loathing while wolfing down a lasagna to fill the void after sleeping

43:45.640 --> 43:50.400
with drawings of a much more handsome and muscular version of myself.

43:50.400 --> 43:54.540
These drawings eventually evolved into erotic fan fiction starring Garfield and myself.

43:54.540 --> 43:59.200
In my head, Garfield still has a woman's body, but someone reading the stories would think

43:59.200 --> 44:01.520
I'm having sex with regular Garfield.

44:01.520 --> 44:03.880
I killed off John in a jealous rage.

44:03.880 --> 44:05.200
I didn't touch Odie.

44:05.200 --> 44:12.200
I enjoy his companionship and don't mind if he watches.

44:12.200 --> 44:17.320
The stories are your pretty basic wish fulfillment stuff, balanced with a self-loathing rants.

44:17.320 --> 44:25.320
I've been doing this near daily for years and I have a substantial amount of writing

44:25.320 --> 44:28.800
in a folder I keep buried in eight different folders.

44:28.800 --> 44:33.040
My girlfriend stumbled across them by accident when they came up in a search and is pretty

44:33.040 --> 44:34.200
freaked out.

44:34.200 --> 44:39.640
How can I show her I'm just a normal guy with a weird outlet for my psychological problems

44:39.640 --> 44:41.400
and not some kind of sicko?

44:41.400 --> 44:45.800
And then they included a sample of some of the erotic fiction and I didn't think I would

44:45.800 --> 44:49.680
ever say this on this podcast, but it's too gross to read out loud.

44:49.680 --> 44:56.000
Okay, first and foremost, ladies and gentlemen at home listening to our podcast, after this,

44:56.000 --> 45:00.600
I don't want to receive any questions of how to meet people and fall in love because this

45:00.600 --> 45:04.240
fucker found a girlfriend.

45:04.240 --> 45:11.360
So on the days that he has unconsensual sex with Garfield in a woman's body, does that

45:11.360 --> 45:13.320
happen on Mondays?

45:13.320 --> 45:15.840
Because that would definitely make a lot of sense.

45:15.840 --> 45:19.800
That would fill in a lot of gaps for me in the narrative.

45:19.800 --> 45:25.280
I also like that he had to go out of his way to clarify that it had nothing to do with

45:25.280 --> 45:28.280
repressed homosexuality.

45:28.280 --> 45:32.280
Anybody who stumbled upon this would be like, you want to have sex with Garfield?

45:32.280 --> 45:33.280
What are you gay?

45:33.280 --> 45:36.920
Yeah, no, no gay boys living in my house.

45:36.920 --> 45:40.960
You'll have sex with Garfield's girlfriend or nothing.

45:40.960 --> 45:43.200
You'll love Gadget and that's it.

45:43.200 --> 45:51.000
Now maybe, just maybe, if you put his head on Pamela Anderson's body, maybe we could

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
make that work.

45:52.000 --> 45:57.440
Guys, I know different strokes for different folks.

45:57.440 --> 46:04.000
Listen, we've all got something buried deep inside that you never, ever, ever want anybody

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
to know ever.

46:05.000 --> 46:11.400
Now, I'm not saying mine would be as weird as putting a woman's body on Garfield's head,

46:11.400 --> 46:13.060
but it's pretty fucking weird.

46:13.060 --> 46:19.200
The secret to not getting made fun of is that you can't tell the entire world, which is

46:19.200 --> 46:21.000
on the internet.

46:21.000 --> 46:25.120
This is a secret you can never, you're embarrassed your girlfriend found out, so you decided

46:25.120 --> 46:26.960
to put it on the internet?

46:26.960 --> 46:28.680
How bad are you at internet?

46:28.680 --> 46:33.840
You can't hide a Yahoo answer in folders, because I found it.

46:33.840 --> 46:36.320
I found it and I know it forever now.

46:36.320 --> 46:39.760
Now everyone knows, it's a ripple effect.

46:39.760 --> 46:41.040
It's a butterfly effect.

46:41.040 --> 46:45.560
Because you put this out, there's going to be a tornado somewhere, because you want to

46:45.560 --> 46:46.560
fuck Garfield.

46:46.560 --> 46:47.560
Right.

46:47.560 --> 46:55.400
But you know the worst thing about it is that by setting a new bar of creepiness, the perpetual

46:55.400 --> 47:00.000
creep out arms race that is the internet, someone else is now going to have to do something

47:00.000 --> 47:01.360
weirder and creepier than this.

47:01.360 --> 47:03.520
It's like the last scene of Batman.

47:03.520 --> 47:04.520
It's escalation.

47:04.520 --> 47:06.760
I've always been a fan of Heathcliff.

47:06.760 --> 47:08.000
Time to step up my game.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
Time to step up my game.

47:09.000 --> 47:15.000
Time to put a fucking Steve Buscemi's body on Heathcliff's head.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
And then I'm going to fuck that.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
Then I'm going to fuck that thing up.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
Come here.

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
What are you, Cat Burt?

47:21.000 --> 47:26.080
I really love the rabbit hole-esque quality of this question, where he kept trying to

47:26.080 --> 47:29.000
make it better and was only making it worse.

47:29.000 --> 47:34.440
By putting Garfield's head on Pamela Anderson, that was supposed to in some way improve the

47:34.440 --> 47:39.000
situation, but I feel that it made it creepier.

47:39.000 --> 47:42.120
Yeah, there's nothing that's going to get you out of that.

47:42.120 --> 47:47.600
Even if at the end you're like, and that's what Tree of Life was about, nothing is going

47:47.600 --> 47:48.600
to save you.

47:48.600 --> 47:53.720
I think when you drop the sentence, I killed John off in a jealous rage.

47:53.720 --> 47:54.720
Yeah.

47:54.720 --> 47:56.960
But I like it when Odie watches.

47:56.960 --> 48:00.400
I wonder what his position on Nermal is.

48:00.400 --> 48:03.440
Why not just fuck Nermal for fuck's sake?

48:03.440 --> 48:10.000
Is Nermal, I thought Nermal, well one, it's still a cartoon cat, but a dude, right?

48:10.000 --> 48:11.720
Is it Nermal a dude?

48:11.720 --> 48:14.120
I thought Nermal was the lady cat.

48:14.120 --> 48:20.280
Nermal's, I'm pretty sure Nermal's asexual, not that that's going to slow this guy down.

48:20.280 --> 48:21.280
Fair enough.

48:21.280 --> 48:22.280
Sure.

48:22.280 --> 48:27.220
Do you guys think, I'm just, if Jim Davis ever saw these drawings, I think he would

48:27.220 --> 48:28.920
literally fucking die.

48:28.920 --> 48:30.440
I think he would fucking die.

48:30.440 --> 48:33.040
I think his heart would explode in his chest and he would die.

48:33.040 --> 48:36.120
He would say my baby and then he'd die.

48:36.120 --> 48:39.800
Yeah he's fine with Garfield minus Garfield, but Garfield plus dick.

48:39.800 --> 48:40.800
Yeah.

48:40.800 --> 48:41.800
Garfield plus.

48:41.800 --> 48:42.800
Garfield plus a vagina.

48:42.800 --> 48:43.800
Garfield plus sweet tits.

48:43.800 --> 48:50.720
Garfield minus Garfield, plus Garfield's head, plus sweet tits, plus a strange dick.

48:50.720 --> 48:52.080
This is awful.

48:52.080 --> 48:57.420
I feel like the answer for this guy is simple and that is you are fighting a losing battle

48:57.420 --> 48:59.400
trying to convince him that you're not a sicko.

48:59.400 --> 49:03.360
I think you need to accept the fact that you are a sicko and it's part of what makes you

49:03.360 --> 49:09.520
you and maybe, I don't know, try to turn it around on her.

49:09.520 --> 49:16.960
How do you, Travis, tell me how to make that fucking riposte work and I'll quit the show.

49:16.960 --> 49:22.320
You say like, well yeah I want to fuck Garfield but you never wear matching socks.

49:22.320 --> 49:23.320
Okay.

49:23.320 --> 49:24.320
What's wrong with you?

49:24.320 --> 49:25.320
Yeah sure.

49:25.320 --> 49:26.320
At least mine's imaginary.

49:26.320 --> 49:28.080
And you don't want to have sex with the lights on.

49:28.080 --> 49:29.080
Yeah.

49:29.080 --> 49:30.240
That's a problem.

49:30.240 --> 49:35.760
Only because I wear my Heathcliff mask, weirdo.

49:35.760 --> 49:38.160
I wouldn't want to do anything with the lights on in a room with this guy.

49:38.160 --> 49:40.280
I would be too afraid he'd find me.

49:40.280 --> 49:42.560
I need to be able to make a quick egress.

49:42.560 --> 49:45.480
Hey, real quick, just for a second.

49:45.480 --> 49:49.640
Let's play devil's advocate here and just like get ourselves in this guy's head space

49:49.640 --> 49:50.640
and just like imagine.

49:50.640 --> 49:51.640
No, I'm not.

49:51.640 --> 49:52.640
I don't want to do that at all.

49:52.640 --> 49:55.660
Guys, come on, come on, come through the door.

49:55.660 --> 49:57.960
We're going to step into this guy's mind.

49:57.960 --> 49:59.240
What if I die in this dream?

49:59.240 --> 50:03.760
You die in the dream and you're stuck in Garfield fucking limbo forever.

50:03.760 --> 50:05.720
You need Joseph Gordon-Levitt to give you the kick.

50:05.720 --> 50:06.720
Yeah, yeah.

50:06.720 --> 50:07.720
Yeah, the kick.

50:07.720 --> 50:08.720
He'll kick you in the head until you die.

50:08.720 --> 50:09.720
Hey, Garfield, give me the kick.

50:09.720 --> 50:10.720
I'm ready.

50:10.720 --> 50:11.720
Okay.

50:11.720 --> 50:16.960
Um, which would you, which, no, come on.

50:16.960 --> 50:19.320
Which would you prefer?

50:19.320 --> 50:23.800
Pamela Anderson body and Garfield head or Garfield body and Pamela Anderson head?

50:23.800 --> 50:30.840
If you had to party down on one of those bad boys, which would you go with?

50:30.840 --> 50:31.840
Additional information.

50:31.840 --> 50:36.840
The Garfield head is wearing sunglasses.

50:36.840 --> 50:41.600
Garfield body suction cup hands or no suction cup hands?

50:41.600 --> 50:42.600
Either or.

50:42.600 --> 50:47.560
Whichever you, whichever would feel be more pleasurable.

50:47.560 --> 50:49.360
Will Garfield's head be into it?

50:49.360 --> 50:54.600
Is he being acerbic and biting or is he down?

50:54.600 --> 50:56.920
Does he realize, okay, okay.

50:56.920 --> 51:03.320
Does Garfield's head on Pamela Anderson's body realize that his very existence is a

51:03.320 --> 51:11.600
sin against God or is he like into it with, does he know that he's a misfit toy or is

51:11.600 --> 51:12.600
he DTF?

51:12.600 --> 51:16.160
Or is he like DTF, like ready to fuck?

51:16.160 --> 51:19.480
And same question for Pamela Anderson head on Garfield body.

51:19.480 --> 51:26.760
Is she like wildly like screaming at the horror, the human centipede ass kind of situation

51:26.760 --> 51:29.280
that she has been placed in or is she like ready?

51:29.280 --> 51:34.160
Or was she born into this world as an abomination and has accepted it over the years?

51:34.160 --> 51:38.760
I think that, I think the gypsy curse that put her in this, this sad state, uh, I think

51:38.760 --> 51:39.760
she knows about it.

51:39.760 --> 51:42.320
I think she's been aware of it for, for quite some time.

51:42.320 --> 51:46.000
So I think that they have both, they've both been in this world like this for such a long

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
time.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
And they are just happy to have some companionship.

51:48.000 --> 51:49.000
Okay.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
Garfield.

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
Do they hang out with each other?

51:51.000 --> 51:52.560
Cause that's how you're making it sound.

51:52.560 --> 51:56.080
Um, no, I think that probably weirdest brothel in the world.

51:56.080 --> 51:57.080
Yeah.

51:57.080 --> 51:58.080
That would probably be awkward.

51:58.080 --> 51:59.080
Um, yeah.

51:59.080 --> 52:04.640
I mean, obviously Garfield's head would prefer feeling companionship, but he realizes that

52:04.640 --> 52:06.760
that is anatomically improbable.

52:06.760 --> 52:08.040
Is there a danger?

52:08.040 --> 52:09.040
Okay.

52:09.040 --> 52:10.480
This is, this is actually what I need to know.

52:10.480 --> 52:11.480
This is key.

52:11.480 --> 52:15.240
Obviously these two things have been created by, by science, not God.

52:15.240 --> 52:16.240
This is nothing.

52:16.240 --> 52:18.280
God did it.

52:18.280 --> 52:24.720
If I have sex with Pam body, Garfield head, is there a danger of impregnation?

52:24.720 --> 52:29.640
Because I'm pretty sure that would bring about the antichrist.

52:29.640 --> 52:30.640
Is that a danger?

52:30.640 --> 52:32.200
I need you to answer this for me.

52:32.200 --> 52:33.200
Um, I dunno.

52:33.200 --> 52:36.180
It would be human ovaries down there.

52:36.180 --> 52:40.120
I'm just saying if we're getting science on it, like it probably human ovaries, but

52:40.120 --> 52:44.840
then again, I don't know cause if it didn't have a hybrid DNA, then it would reject your

52:44.840 --> 52:45.840
seed.

52:45.840 --> 52:48.840
Your seed would find no purchase in her, her, her loamy soil.

52:48.840 --> 52:49.840
Okay.

52:49.840 --> 52:50.840
Let me ask you one more question.

52:50.840 --> 52:51.840
Okay.

52:51.840 --> 52:52.840
Please.

52:52.840 --> 52:56.040
Is Odie there and is he just jerking it so right?

52:56.040 --> 53:02.840
Odie loves what he sees either, either way, either scenario, Odie's down, Odie is down

53:02.840 --> 53:03.840
to clown.

53:03.840 --> 53:04.840
Uh, there is.

53:04.840 --> 53:09.200
Justin, do you want to pick first?

53:09.200 --> 53:14.320
Well Griffin, you asked the questions that you have to answer.

53:14.320 --> 53:28.040
I'll say, I'll say if it's Bill Murray's voice, pan body, Garf head, well, well I'm flaccid

53:28.040 --> 53:29.040
forever now.

53:29.040 --> 53:30.040
He had a good run.

53:30.040 --> 53:31.040
I knew it would happen.

53:31.040 --> 53:32.040
I knew it would happen eventually.

53:32.040 --> 53:33.040
Travis?

53:33.040 --> 53:34.040
Oh no.

53:34.040 --> 53:39.040
I've already killed myself in this situation.

53:39.040 --> 53:52.800
Decenting opinion from, from justice, from justice McElroy?

53:52.800 --> 53:53.800
I think.

53:53.800 --> 53:54.800
Okay.

53:54.800 --> 53:55.800
What did you choose?

53:55.800 --> 54:00.640
I went pan Bobby, pan body, Garf head, uh, Bill, Bill Murray voice.

54:00.640 --> 54:01.640
Okay.

54:01.640 --> 54:05.120
I'm going to go.

54:05.120 --> 54:06.120
So Travis is dead.

54:06.120 --> 54:11.200
Travis, if, if afforded the options, Travis would kill himself.

54:11.200 --> 54:16.960
Can I throw Travis's body at the corpse and buy myself enough time, Travis's corpse at

54:16.960 --> 54:19.360
the creation and buy myself enough time to get out?

54:19.360 --> 54:20.360
Here's the problem though.

54:20.360 --> 54:22.240
You throw it at pan body, Garf head.

54:22.240 --> 54:24.060
Who's that coming up from behind?

54:24.060 --> 54:28.560
It's Garf body, pan head and, and it is very upset.

54:28.560 --> 54:29.560
Okay.

54:29.560 --> 54:30.680
For many reasons.

54:30.680 --> 54:37.640
You have in your inventory, a dagger and a shield, open doors, open doors are West and

54:37.640 --> 54:38.640
North.

54:38.640 --> 54:39.640
Okay.

54:39.640 --> 54:49.240
Can I, I am going to go with pan head, Garfield body, but Lorenzo music voice.

54:49.240 --> 54:54.480
Um, I have a thing with the real Ghostbusters, so I think that would be enough to get me

54:54.480 --> 54:55.480
through it.

54:55.480 --> 55:05.560
You're worried, you're worried about finishing, I can't, I can't, you also changed Pam Anderson's

55:05.560 --> 55:06.560
voice to Garfield's.

55:06.560 --> 55:12.320
No listen, if I have, if I, if it's, I have too much respect for Bill Murray's work, if

55:12.320 --> 55:18.360
it's Lorenzo music, Pamela Anderson's voice, if I, if it's, I don't see why Pam Anderson's

55:18.360 --> 55:25.240
voice is not going to come out of Garfield's head and I, I find Larry the crash test dummy

55:25.240 --> 55:28.000
to be a very soothing sexual influence.

55:28.000 --> 55:33.140
So if I can pretend that if it's Lorenzo music's voice and I can pretend it's Peter

55:33.140 --> 55:38.040
Venkman of the Ghostbusters cartoon or Larry the crash test dummy, or perhaps even tummy

55:38.040 --> 55:41.200
gummy from Disney's adventure gummy bears.

55:41.200 --> 55:44.200
How many other cartoons can you ruin for me right now?

55:44.200 --> 55:45.200
I can't.

55:45.200 --> 55:49.440
That's all Lorenzo music that I'm aware of, probably something else that didn't even,

55:49.440 --> 55:54.760
that thought didn't even the thought of what would be the most sexually pleasurable that

55:54.760 --> 55:55.760
didn't even cross my mind.

55:55.760 --> 55:58.120
This is pure survival instincts.

55:58.120 --> 56:01.960
I can't think about Bill Murray even, I don't want to ruin Bill Murray.

56:01.960 --> 56:04.120
Like I don't think that that's that much to ask.

56:04.120 --> 56:06.440
I don't want to ruin Bill Murray for myself.

56:06.440 --> 56:09.040
We need to, we need to pull out of this nosedive.

56:09.040 --> 56:10.040
Let's move on.

56:10.040 --> 56:11.040
Pull out of something.

56:11.040 --> 56:17.480
Hey, I am 24 and I'm trying to get my sexies so right, but I'm afraid there's one thing

56:17.480 --> 56:19.440
that's holding me back, vidya games.

56:19.440 --> 56:23.440
I love them, play them all the time, talk about them all the time and most people my

56:23.440 --> 56:27.800
age seem to enjoy them as well, but I can't seem to shake the feeling that they are kid

56:27.800 --> 56:34.280
stuff and that people think of me as a man child when I play my game boy at Starbucks.

56:34.280 --> 56:38.440
I really don't want to stop playing, but is it time to put down childish things and start

56:38.440 --> 56:40.480
reading a newspaper?

56:40.480 --> 56:43.120
That's from digitally distraught in Davis.

56:43.120 --> 56:50.200
Oh man, this, oh fuck, this is really rough because Justin and I both write about games

56:50.200 --> 56:52.880
for a living and so I don't want to sound like they are a thing that you should be ashamed

56:52.880 --> 56:58.440
of, but I do have a real problem with playing them on like handheld devices in public.

56:58.440 --> 56:59.440
You know what?

56:59.440 --> 57:00.440
I feel the same way.

57:00.440 --> 57:04.560
I play video games a lot and when I started reading this question, I did not have a problem

57:04.560 --> 57:10.760
with it until you hit the phrase game boy, which let's face it is not like not designed

57:10.760 --> 57:13.200
to sound manly in any way.

57:13.200 --> 57:16.520
I don't think that's, I don't think that there's something that suddenly becomes very childish

57:16.520 --> 57:17.520
about this handheld game.

57:17.520 --> 57:18.920
I don't think the problem is the name of it.

57:18.920 --> 57:21.880
I don't think people are walking by and saying game boy, huh?

57:21.880 --> 57:22.880
I need a game man.

57:22.880 --> 57:24.960
I want my tall vintage rip.

57:24.960 --> 57:27.680
No, it's not about getting a game man.

57:27.680 --> 57:29.720
It's about the difference.

57:29.720 --> 57:34.640
It's just like it is, it's named that way and so, you know, it's not exactly, I'm just

57:34.640 --> 57:38.460
saying that across the board, it was not designed to be incredibly adult.

57:38.460 --> 57:41.760
It's not, I mean, okay.

57:41.760 --> 57:50.720
Video games by and large, you're not going to be seen as like a more mature, it is not

57:50.720 --> 57:56.520
going to help the perception of your maturity if you're playing a video game in public.

57:56.520 --> 57:59.400
Does that always stop me from playing a video game in public?

57:59.400 --> 58:01.520
No, sometimes I'm not, I'm not, I don't have any fucks to do with it.

58:01.520 --> 58:02.920
You just have to not give a fuck.

58:02.920 --> 58:07.280
Like I was, it's also way more socially acceptable on like an iPhone.

58:07.280 --> 58:09.000
And there's, that's the, that's what's so fucked up.

58:09.000 --> 58:13.640
If I'm playing Pokemon on my game boy micro, which I bought because I prayed it would be

58:13.640 --> 58:17.920
so tiny that people couldn't see it in my hands on the subway in Chicago.

58:17.920 --> 58:22.020
I'm going to get some, I'm going to get some looks, but if I'm playing it on an iPad, which

58:22.020 --> 58:25.640
God please Nintendo make that dream come true.

58:25.640 --> 58:26.640
It's like, look at him.

58:26.640 --> 58:27.640
He's so sophisticated.

58:27.640 --> 58:28.640
What's he doing?

58:28.640 --> 58:29.640
Browsing the web?

58:29.640 --> 58:30.640
Nope.

58:30.640 --> 58:31.640
Catching them all.

58:31.640 --> 58:35.200
I, I, and I'm being honest with you here because like I, my whole career is video games.

58:35.200 --> 58:42.080
So like I'm not disparaging them and I personally know the, the progress the medium has made

58:42.080 --> 58:45.140
in towards like maturity over the past 10 years or what have you.

58:45.140 --> 58:50.360
I'm just saying that you're not shaking the perception that they still are a childish

58:50.360 --> 58:52.920
thing to be playing in public.

58:52.920 --> 58:55.540
I mean, people are not going to think of you as a mature person.

58:55.540 --> 58:56.540
Maybe you don't care.

58:56.540 --> 59:00.600
Maybe that's the, see, if I'm going to be in public and I'm going to be consuming media,

59:00.600 --> 59:01.840
I want to consume media.

59:01.840 --> 59:05.240
That's going to make them think that I'm cool or cooler, you know?

59:05.240 --> 59:08.160
So like a newspaper, it looks very grown up and debonair.

59:08.160 --> 59:09.160
Yeah.

59:09.160 --> 59:11.640
But let me, let me counter argument that.

59:11.640 --> 59:12.640
Okay.

59:12.640 --> 59:13.640
Who?

59:13.640 --> 59:17.040
Like the people that are on the subway, the random people who are at Starbucks, who gives

59:17.040 --> 59:18.040
two shits.

59:18.040 --> 59:19.720
You're never going to see those people again.

59:19.720 --> 59:20.720
This is what I'm saying.

59:20.720 --> 59:25.600
If you're not in a mood for fuck giving, then just play it and who cares?

59:25.600 --> 59:30.240
Like if you're already paired off with somebody, you got a beautiful child, like fucking play

59:30.240 --> 59:31.240
your video games in public.

59:31.240 --> 59:33.480
But that's, but at the same time, there are people out there.

59:33.480 --> 59:39.720
Like what's so great about, um, events like, uh, uh, like PAX and stuff like that, uh,

59:39.720 --> 59:44.840
is that when you, when you are playing your, your PS Vita in public or something like that,

59:44.840 --> 59:47.600
people aren't going to walk by and like give you a dirty look.

59:47.600 --> 59:49.800
They're like, Hey, what are you, what are you playing?

59:49.800 --> 59:51.880
Like it'll attract a certain type of crowd.

59:51.880 --> 59:57.960
And I don't think we should say that it either won't do that or that that crowd is, you know,

59:57.960 --> 59:59.920
not the kind of people you should be associating with.

59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.640
I'm just fucking do it.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:03.600
Who fucking, who gives a fuck?

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:08.280
I wish I was playing video games all the time, but I, I know there are certain environments

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:11.920
like if you're in a reception area waiting to go in for a job interview or something,

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:17.560
don't break out your Pokemon, but unless you're going in killing some time, yeah, unless you're

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:23.840
going in for the job interview for the position of number one Pokemon master, I, and I, and

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:29.400
if we're looking at like a larger scale, like in terms of not just like what you, what people

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:36.200
see in public, the thing that has always, uh, that, that helps me to counterbalance

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:42.040
whatever perception people might have of video games is that myself, I take in a lot of different

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:43.040
media.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:50.600
Like I read, you know, I listen to music, I watch movies, like it's not, um, video game,

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:55.680
whatever people may think of people who play video games, I know for my own peace of mind

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:58.400
that I'm a pretty well-rounded person.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:02.680
So I don't, it doesn't bother me, you know, what people want to think.

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:08.200
If you are the sort of person that only plays video games, that doesn't have knowledge of,

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:11.760
you know, what is going on in the world, like, you know, you mentioned a newspaper, like,

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:12.760
are you reading a newspaper?

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:15.000
I, I try to read a newspaper every day.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.400
I mean, this guy obviously listens to podcasts, like we can tell that he has some good media

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.400
habits.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:21.600
Yeah, that's true.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.120
You're breaking it up a little bit.

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:24.800
Um, so, so don't give anything up.

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:29.300
Are you saying like diversify, you know, maybe get, and then people can think whatever they

01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:30.300
want to fuck.

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:33.800
Get really beefy strong and then get super beefy strong.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:40.880
And then you can play like the craziest, like Japanese nudity dating game on your PSP in

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:41.880
public.

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:42.880
Get super beefy strong and get a Tamagotchi.

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:43.880
Yeah.

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:46.000
And then when people walk by, when people walk by you, they're not going to see shit

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.760
because they're going to be like, who's this guy?

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:51.640
And then they'll see your guns and be like, uh oh.

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:56.000
The only, the other thing you can do to really help the cause is play video games in public,

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.680
but dress like really good.

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:00.240
Like dress like an adult.

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:03.960
Dress super debonair, you know, no black cargo shorts for you.

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:04.960
Yeah.

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.640
You're, you're dressed like an adult and playing video games.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.180
No chain to your wallet.

01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:09.440
Your wallet's going nowhere.

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:10.440
Yeah.

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:13.880
If I saw, who's a stylish man?

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:15.520
Donald, Jesse Thorne, Donald Trump.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:20.440
If I saw Jesse Thorne collecting Pokemon, I don't know how that would treat me.

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:22.840
I could actually probably see that happening.

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:23.840
What about like Donald Trump?

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:30.640
What if I saw Barack Obama, like in a sweet suit, like sweet silk suit, just like, just

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:34.960
like dip it into fire red and I'm like, you know, I'd start with squirtle.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.080
You're the best president.

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.080
You're a squirtle president.

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:40.440
We've reached a point, I think in video gaming where you say those things and none of them

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:44.040
sound completely utterly ridiculous to me.

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:49.040
Like I could almost picture maybe not a game boy, but Barack Obama would kick him backwards

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.560
in fruit ninja on his iPhone.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:51.560
No, no, he's a wee.

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.640
He loves the wee.

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:54.640
He does?

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.640
This is public knowledge.

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:56.640
Yeah.

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:57.640
He's into it.

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.720
He drinks a cold PBR and plays some Wii.

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:00.720
Yeah.

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:01.720
No, he doesn't do that.

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:02.720
He does too, you guys.

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:03.720
He loves the peepers.

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:04.720
All right.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.720
Loves peepers.

01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:06.720
Griffin.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:07.720
Griffin, you know what I mean.

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:08.720
A Yahoo answer.

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:10.680
Can we just do the Garfield one again?

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:14.680
Actually, that got a little gross for me.

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.240
Not going to be able to do it for a few years.

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:20.200
Well, this one isn't incredibly and accidentally related to that one.

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.480
It's sent in by Yahoo Answers user question mark.

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.520
Got to put names down, people.

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:27.000
Got to know who sent them in.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.640
Got to cite them properly.

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:37.560
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user xxsnailsxx who asks, is it possibly a cat likes aggressive

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:38.560
petting?

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:44.480
I know that sounds very weird and you may have had weird thoughts, but in all seriousness,

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.800
my Siamese cat is strange.

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:52.120
I can pet him gently or tickle him or rub his ears, head, chin, etc. and he just chills

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:53.340
like it doesn't matter.

01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:57.640
If I pet him aggressively, put pressure on him, pull at him when I pet him.

01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:00.240
He'll start to purr like he's the happiest cat in the world.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:04.100
He'll start fights with me, bite me, claw me, and then flop over and love on me and

01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:06.200
start purring like I'm the best cat mom ever.

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.960
Is it possible for a cat to like tough love?

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:09.960
This little guy is evil.

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:10.960
Ha ha.

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:11.960
Hey, cat people.

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:12.960
No, no, no.

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:17.960
Is it possible this cat just loves that rough stuff?

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:31.680
Griffin, if people like rough stuff, I don't see why cats can't also like rough stuff.

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:35.960
Their problem with it is, is that we already did a cat fucking question.

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:39.120
That cats don't like, cats don't have mouths.

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:43.200
They can't tell you what they like and don't like, so you probably should assume the thing

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:46.240
that isn't abusing them, right?

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:50.640
And I also have to assume, when I hear that there might be cats that like rough stuff,

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:55.160
that there are cats that like it super romantic.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:05:02.320
You light some candles, pour a glass of wine, turn on some smooth music, and you just-

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:08.800
This cat loves a warm bath, why don't you drop some salts, baby?

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:16.520
Sometimes my cat and I will meet at an agreed upon location and pretend that we don't know

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:17.520
each other.

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:20.520
Hey, what you doing in this alley, girl?

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:21.520
Damn.

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.040
Why don't you come on home with me?

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:25.920
Let me get you some warm milk, perhaps a flea bath.

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:31.600
Hey, hey baby, you want some pussy?

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:35.120
That's a little joke I like to tell, because I'm a sweet pussy cat.

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:39.080
I'm a sweet pussy cat.

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:43.440
Hey, you want some cottage cheese mixed up with peaches?

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:51.120
I ain't Siamese, but I would love to attach with your body, what do you say?

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.840
I'm just a little nasty tabby, don't worry about it.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:55.840
Yo, that's a little bad, girl.

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:58.080
Hey, does anybody smell tuna?

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:02.120
Don't worry about your bed getting all ruffled, I'm a short hair, pretty, it's gonna feel

01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:05.040
real nice against your skin.

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:08.600
Don't worry, baby, I've been declawed.

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:12.880
No telling marks in the morning over here, I'm just going to gently paw, gently massage

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:13.880
your tummy.

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:21.200
This is a lung behavior, I remember from trying to get milk out of my mother's sack.

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:25.640
Had to compete with four to five brothers and sisters, typically.

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:29.760
Genetically speaking, it's a large litter.

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:33.320
And don't worry about it, hey baby, I'm gonna be dead in like seven years.

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:35.960
Ain't no need to tie yourself down.

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:40.720
You're not looking for something long-term, yeah, I dig that, I dig that.

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:46.520
My lifespan is rapidly accelerating past your years of humans.

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:50.560
Baby don't mess with those dogs, don't get down and dirty with the dogs.

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:51.560
No, listen, hey.

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:54.240
I am so uncomfortable right now.

01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:56.240
Leave the canaries cage on them, baby.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:57.240
Oh God.

01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:02.320
What if I name a little snack a-rooey after we, well, you know, meow.

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:05.040
Okay, we gotta stop.

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:06.040
I tried to be cool.

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:10.720
I want to issue a public apology to anybody who was wearing headphones because that had

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:11.720
to be the worst.

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:17.800
I would have had an ice pick jammed into my cortex because there had to be like 30 seconds

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:22.480
in where there was like an inner monologue of, are they talking about, no, there's no

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:23.480
way.

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:25.640
They're still going.

01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:31.680
The creepiest part is, the worst part, I should say, because we did it, the worst part is

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:36.040
that there's one man or woman who has just realized like, well, this is the thing that

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.040

I need to listen to the McElroy brothers do impressions of a human voiced sexy cat.

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:49.000
Yeah, it's somewhere between red dwarf and red light distance.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.200
Somebody is, and there's also somebody hoping that we do a voice impression for the cat

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:56.880
that loves to just like, just fuck, just like fuck.

01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:00.800
If you want to do that, just go see cats, that's what it's all about, cats love to fuck.

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:06.920
Mr. Mistoffelees loves to cats, loves to colon DTF, loves to be, he loves to be choked.
