WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.920
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother and my brother and me, an advice show from

00:47.920 --> 00:50.880
modern era. We usually come up with something to say at the beginning,

00:51.520 --> 00:55.280
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

00:55.280 --> 00:58.080
I'm your babiest brother, Griffin McElroy. Did you just tell everybody

00:58.080 --> 01:01.120
what we won't do? My thing for the beginning this week

01:01.120 --> 01:03.120
was a little bit of my brother and my brother and me trivia,

01:03.680 --> 01:05.840
in that we normally come up with something to do at the beginning.

01:05.840 --> 01:08.800
Fun facts, here's a thing we're not doing this week. You know why?

01:08.800 --> 01:12.240
Because we stay up till like 2am watching the Pokemon Live musical.

01:15.040 --> 01:18.720
That is true, Griffin. Okay, we're all sitting here recording.

01:18.720 --> 01:21.040
I'm going to paint a picture for everybody who can't see us right now.

01:21.040 --> 01:25.360
Justin's pointing furiously at Travis and the board, just pointed to something up.

01:25.360 --> 01:29.520
Are we good? Those levels look much better to me.

01:30.240 --> 01:32.560
Oh, by the way, if you're just tuning in as your second episode ever,

01:32.560 --> 01:34.960
and you listen to the canonized episode, we curse a lot.

01:34.960 --> 01:38.880
Ooh, fuck, it feels so good to be back in the fucking saddle.

01:40.080 --> 01:43.520
We had hundreds of people who- Six hundreds of people.

01:43.520 --> 01:48.320
Listen, we had six hundreds of people who traveled from hundreds of miles away

01:48.320 --> 01:54.560
to see our show. Our wives are literally in the goddamn next room,

01:54.560 --> 01:57.760
and they cannot be bothered. They have a free-

01:57.760 --> 02:02.400
What do you want them to do, stand in the doorway and just watch us lovingly bullshit at each other?

02:02.400 --> 02:06.720
I want them to pull up a couple chairs, get some nog, and make it a real festive show.

02:07.680 --> 02:10.880
A personal, intimate live- You know what? I could eBay that.

02:10.880 --> 02:15.280
A personal, intimate live show. Just you and your favorite brothers

02:15.280 --> 02:20.880
doing their comedy show, so intimate. I asked my wife to do a special Christmas

02:20.880 --> 02:24.960
hour special with us, and you know what she did? She gave me an old finger and she made this noise.

02:28.800 --> 02:32.240
So I'm sure that our wives will be stopping in throughout this show to say hi.

02:32.240 --> 02:34.800
Kind of a family. Maybe sing some songs.

02:34.800 --> 02:37.920
Maybe you'll hear them laughing in the background. They're great jokes.

02:37.920 --> 02:41.760
Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe that also might not happen.

02:41.760 --> 02:46.080
If you came to our live show, thank you very much for coming to Huntington.

02:46.800 --> 02:50.720
We hope you have fun. We hope we can do that again next year.

02:50.720 --> 02:55.760
Maybe in a more acoustically treated building and or room.

02:55.760 --> 02:59.200
A less century old building than that building was.

02:59.920 --> 03:02.640
But the show, the audio for the recording was good.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.600
Yeah, it was good. But apparently some folks listening

03:05.600 --> 03:08.800
had some troubles hearing it. If that was you, we are sorry, but we hope-

03:08.800 --> 03:12.480
I'm not sorry. The magic of being there made up for it.

03:12.480 --> 03:15.920
I heard a lot of people say, Echo, guess what? You just got fucking two shows.

03:15.920 --> 03:17.600
Two bonus shows. Two shows in one.

03:17.600 --> 03:21.280
And here's a little tidbit from us to you. There was Echo on stage.

03:22.560 --> 03:25.840
Try doing that at all. It is an-

03:25.840 --> 03:26.560
But it was great.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.160
But it was great. It was a lot of fun.

03:29.440 --> 03:33.600
Next year we want to have just a festival.

03:33.600 --> 03:37.600
Candlelight's Festival. Get every podcast in the world to come to Huntington.

03:37.600 --> 03:38.880
And sing a song on stage.

03:38.880 --> 03:42.480
And sing a song on stage. I just want to be like Stephen Colbert for like a second.

03:42.480 --> 03:45.680
He can get like, like, Bill de Blasio.

03:45.680 --> 03:50.400
And like- That was the best thing that he had was Bill de Blasio.

03:50.400 --> 03:54.560
Literally, I cannot think of a single person that is- George Lucas.

03:54.560 --> 03:55.120
Yeah, yeah.

03:55.120 --> 03:55.600
You know what I mean?

03:55.600 --> 03:56.880
I think he'd get Gio.

03:56.880 --> 03:57.520
You think he'd get Gio?

03:57.520 --> 03:58.480
What's he doing?

03:58.480 --> 03:59.280
He's not doing anything.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.400
Making that Ferngully movie.

04:00.400 --> 04:01.840
We'll talk about this off mic.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.520
Well, yeah, we'll get Lucas.

04:03.520 --> 04:04.560
We'll get back to you.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.240
Lucas, if you're out there, get at me.

04:06.800 --> 04:09.520
When I'm dining out specifically at restaurants with an Asian flair,

04:09.520 --> 04:11.680
I tend to prefer my food rather spicy.

04:11.680 --> 04:15.760
While I love the burn, spicy food usually makes my nose run.

04:15.760 --> 04:19.520
I know that by no means acceptable will blow your nose on a cloth napkin at a restaurant,

04:19.520 --> 04:24.960
but I can wipe my nose covertly without making any disgusting noises.

04:24.960 --> 04:25.760
Can I wipe my nose?

04:25.760 --> 04:26.480
They were saying can.

04:26.480 --> 04:27.120
Can I?

04:27.120 --> 04:28.240
They weren't bragging.

04:28.240 --> 04:29.120
I can do it.

04:29.120 --> 04:31.040
Don't even act like I can't wipe my nose.

04:31.040 --> 04:33.040
Don't even try to spot me wiping my nose.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.160
You're going to miss it.

04:34.160 --> 04:35.280
I'm illusion.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.840
Did a ghost just fly across Linda's face?

04:37.840 --> 04:39.520
That's from Restaurant Runs.

04:39.520 --> 04:40.160
Restaurant Runs.

04:40.160 --> 04:43.040
Well, that's a different thing.

04:43.040 --> 04:46.480
Man, the spicy food is giving me the Restaurant Runs.

04:46.480 --> 04:47.440
Yeah, I mean, both.

04:47.440 --> 04:48.320
Why can't it be both?

04:50.560 --> 04:51.600
I mean, what's your alternative?

04:51.600 --> 04:54.400
Just let yourself have a leaky mess on your face.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.960
But this used to not be a thing because people used to have like

04:56.960 --> 05:00.320
handkerchiefs like on the ready like all the time for this.

05:00.320 --> 05:04.560
Because can you imagine being that restaurant employee that has cloth napkins and be like,

05:04.560 --> 05:07.120
oh, yeah, OK, snotty McGee on two.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.360
And we got snotty Deborah on six.

05:09.360 --> 05:15.600
In Victorian days, you would have usually wood or ivory nose plug

05:15.600 --> 05:17.360
that you would put into your nostrils.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.880
And that would help keep that.

05:18.880 --> 05:23.920
Ladies would sometimes decorate theirs with like sparrows or leaves and shit.

05:23.920 --> 05:26.720
And they just pop that badmama jammer right in there.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.240
That's how Chrashan got her look.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.680
That's how Chrashan's look was born.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.760
Do you guys ever think about old timey handkerchief days

05:31.760 --> 05:34.240
where it was just like a catch all for all of the plague

05:34.240 --> 05:36.480
that you had inside of your nasal cavities?

05:36.480 --> 05:40.640
And then when they get home and like take that bad boy out of their pocket,

05:40.640 --> 05:41.840
how wouldn't you just?

05:43.120 --> 05:43.600
I would just.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.920
It's also not like they had their laundry game on point or anything,

05:47.920 --> 05:48.400
you know what I mean?

05:48.400 --> 05:50.000
They weren't throwing OxiClean in there.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.760
They never had a fresh handkerchief.

05:51.760 --> 05:53.200
Did they even have water?

05:53.200 --> 05:53.920
They probably did.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.240
No, water wasn't invented until 1922.

05:56.240 --> 05:58.720
Yeah, everyone was just super fucking thirsty, basically.

05:58.720 --> 05:59.760
No, they had Gatorade.

05:59.760 --> 06:04.800
No, just have a handkerchief with you that says like my spicy buddy.

06:06.560 --> 06:09.440
Then have it embroidered with the words my spicy buddy.

06:09.440 --> 06:11.600
And then when you get really to business,

06:11.600 --> 06:13.440
everybody will be like, you got to drop it.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.440
You got to pull them out because then they'll get excited.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.600
They'll get excited to see you wipe your nose.

06:17.600 --> 06:20.320
And that's a hard needle to thread.

06:20.320 --> 06:20.820
Yeah.

06:22.720 --> 06:23.600
I'm sorry.

06:23.600 --> 06:24.720
It's very distracting.

06:25.360 --> 06:29.520
We had several guests from listeners at the live show.

06:29.520 --> 06:30.320
Thank you all so, so much.

06:30.320 --> 06:31.360
Thank you so much.

06:31.360 --> 06:41.360
One of the oddest was eight VHS copies of assorted Eddie Murphy films on VHS.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.680
And I was just sitting here noticing that The Nutty Professor,

06:43.680 --> 06:47.360
The Nutty Professor 2, well, they obviously had the same box art.

06:47.360 --> 06:48.320
That's fine.

06:48.320 --> 06:51.680
But it's also basically the same as Dr. Doolittle.

06:51.680 --> 06:54.800
Basically, it's like they were just saying, hey, this is the same movie.

06:54.800 --> 06:55.440
It's just the same thing again.

06:55.440 --> 06:56.800
Let's just keep this branding going.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.000
Let's keep this brand going.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.040
Yeah.

06:59.040 --> 07:01.440
That Murph train will never stop rolling.

07:01.440 --> 07:02.560
Never stop the Murph train.

07:02.560 --> 07:03.360
I think there's actually nine.

07:03.360 --> 07:04.560
I think one might be on the floor.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.160
We had some fun with those VHS tapes.

07:06.160 --> 07:06.960
I tell you what, boy.

07:06.960 --> 07:07.920
Oh, boy.

07:07.920 --> 07:08.240
Oh, boy.

07:08.240 --> 07:09.840
Did we have some fun with those VHS tapes?

07:09.840 --> 07:10.640
I made a fort.

07:10.640 --> 07:11.520
You want to Yahoo?

07:11.520 --> 07:12.960
Yeah, I guess.

07:12.960 --> 07:13.680
Got Yahoo.

07:15.040 --> 07:17.360
That was sent in by Adam Bash.

07:17.360 --> 07:18.000
Thank you, Adam.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.520
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

07:21.280 --> 07:22.720
I prefer Adam Franklin.

07:22.720 --> 07:23.220
OK.

07:24.080 --> 07:24.880
I got you.

07:24.880 --> 07:28.160
Franklin and Bash goop, pretty tight, pretty tight.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.880
I'm Adam Rizzoli, and I'm Adam Ailes.

07:30.880 --> 07:36.640
This Yahoo Answers user asks, my boyfriend gave me a 60-count box of waffles for Christmas.

07:36.640 --> 07:40.240
He seems so excited about it, but I don't want to hurt his feelings.

07:40.240 --> 07:43.840
And then there's a picture of a AGO Homestyle 60-count waffle box.

07:43.840 --> 07:44.480
It's big, man.

07:44.480 --> 07:44.720
It's big.

07:44.720 --> 07:45.760
And it's name brand.

07:45.760 --> 07:48.240
This isn't your off-brand store brand waffles.

07:48.240 --> 07:53.200
Yeah, this isn't like yum, yum, and yum ones, 60 good time waffles.

07:53.200 --> 07:56.000
That's probably a $20 box of waffles.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.040
That you think?

07:57.040 --> 07:57.840
Yeah.

07:57.840 --> 07:58.400
60?

07:58.400 --> 07:59.680
That's a pretty good value.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.120
Pretty good value.

08:01.120 --> 08:01.840
60?

08:01.840 --> 08:06.400
We're talking about $23 waffle meals for $1 each.

08:06.400 --> 08:11.280
I'm trying to think, because I want to say a regular box of AGOs is like, what, $3, $4?

08:11.840 --> 08:13.840
And that only has four and a half AGOs in it.

08:13.840 --> 08:14.400
Mm-hmm.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.640
So now we're talking 60, so I'm going to do some math.

08:16.640 --> 08:18.240
OK, just tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

08:18.240 --> 08:21.520
So yeah, you're paying like $0.06 an ounce.

08:21.520 --> 08:25.120
This is a tough gift for somebody who struggles with weight.

08:25.120 --> 08:27.440
Because you get a box of waffles, right?

08:27.440 --> 08:29.600
And you're like, well, I'm going to treat myself.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.960
I'm going to have a waffle.

08:30.960 --> 08:33.440
But then you think, well, it's time to get my life together.

08:33.440 --> 08:34.240
It's time to lose weight.

08:34.240 --> 08:39.440
But then you see, well, I'm not going to be losing weight till this box is empty.

08:39.440 --> 08:43.600
The diet starts as soon as I pop my last AGO.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.680
Let's get it down to what you do on your deathbed.

08:46.720 --> 08:48.560
Let go, my soul.

08:48.560 --> 08:50.320
Let go.

08:50.320 --> 08:53.680
Yeah, I mean, then you got to at least eat it down to a nice round number.

08:53.680 --> 08:56.000
You got to say, well, today I'm getting it down to 50.

08:56.560 --> 08:58.320
But then you eat one too many, 49.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.320
You can't stop at 49.

09:00.320 --> 09:02.240
No, you have to eat the 50th.

09:02.240 --> 09:03.360
You got to keep rocking.

09:03.360 --> 09:06.320
I like this president because this president is saying, hey,

09:06.320 --> 09:08.560
I'm going to move into your freezer for a while.

09:09.440 --> 09:12.160
Like, I'm going to keep this stuff at your place.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.600
I want to keep these waffles at your house.

09:13.600 --> 09:17.120
You know, she's not adequately impressed by the fact

09:17.120 --> 09:19.120
that that's a tough wrap.

09:19.120 --> 09:20.160
That's a tough wrap.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.280
You got to time that.

09:21.280 --> 09:23.680
They're not individual waffles, Justin.

09:23.680 --> 09:24.400
They're in a box.

09:24.400 --> 09:27.920
No, he's thinking about their temperature considerations.

09:27.920 --> 09:28.640
Right, right.

09:28.640 --> 09:31.200
I don't know what the paper does for insulation.

09:31.200 --> 09:31.760
I don't know.

09:31.760 --> 09:33.200
What's that inside the freezer?

09:33.200 --> 09:36.160
Did Santa leave behind a special present?

09:36.160 --> 09:37.440
I hope it's not a head.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.920
Somebody should check in the freezer.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.600
What's that puddle underneath the tree?

09:41.600 --> 09:42.560
Did the stand?

09:42.560 --> 09:44.240
No, that's waffle juice.

09:44.240 --> 09:44.960
Waffles are fucked up.

09:44.960 --> 09:45.760
Frozen waffle juice.

09:45.760 --> 09:49.040
I'm just like, wicked bad at presents, I guess.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.960
Does it say how long they've been together?

09:50.960 --> 09:51.520
No.

09:51.520 --> 09:53.760
Because there's a weird bell curve that I think they are.

09:53.760 --> 09:54.560
They get worse.

09:54.560 --> 09:54.960
You're right.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.000
The longer they're in the box.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.080
But if you've been together two weeks, right,

09:58.080 --> 10:00.000
and you give them a 60 count, it's like, OK, right.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.040
I wasn't expecting anything.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.160
We've been together two weeks.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.000
If you've been together like 20 years,

10:04.000 --> 10:05.440
and he gets you like Eggo's, it's like,

10:05.440 --> 10:06.720
oh, what a fun present.

10:06.720 --> 10:08.240
Because you know how much I love Eggo's,

10:08.240 --> 10:09.600
or this is a fun ironic joke.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.920
But if you've been together like a year and get Eggo's,

10:11.920 --> 10:12.800
you're done, though.

10:12.800 --> 10:13.280
You're done.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.880
Do you not?

10:14.880 --> 10:19.120
Isn't there also a window where it's like, whoa, moving a little

10:19.120 --> 10:19.840
fast, huh?

10:19.840 --> 10:21.440
Oh, 60?

10:21.440 --> 10:22.960
I'll start at four and a half.

10:22.960 --> 10:24.080
I guess you've got a point.

10:24.080 --> 10:27.120
If it was 12 waffles, there is no, that's fine.

10:27.120 --> 10:27.680
Whatever.

10:27.680 --> 10:30.560
12 waffles, I'll give a person on the street 12 waffles.

10:30.560 --> 10:31.040
Right.

10:31.040 --> 10:31.920
60 waffles.

10:31.920 --> 10:34.080
Jesus, that's a commitment to yourself and to waffles.

10:34.080 --> 10:35.840
Yeah, that's like a modern version

10:35.840 --> 10:37.360
of giving somebody your apartment key.

10:37.360 --> 10:39.440
Like, hey, we're always going to have waffles for a while.

10:39.440 --> 10:41.760
What if there's an engagement ring inside one of the waffles?

10:41.760 --> 10:44.400
But then you won't know for like four months,

10:44.400 --> 10:45.680
because that's how long it's going to take you.

10:45.680 --> 10:47.760
Well, unless you get in the first waffle.

10:47.760 --> 10:48.880
Oh, no.

10:48.880 --> 10:50.080
The object is so slim.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.240
Well, you say that, but somebody's got to win,

10:52.240 --> 10:53.200
and it might as well be you.

10:53.840 --> 10:55.360
My mother is an older mom.

10:55.360 --> 10:56.080
I'm 22.

10:56.080 --> 10:56.720
She's 60.

10:57.680 --> 11:00.880
And she recently received a new smartphone from my father

11:00.880 --> 11:02.720
as a belated birthday gift.

11:02.720 --> 11:03.920
This is all fine and dandy.

11:03.920 --> 11:06.480
However, some at the AT&T store are turning on to this app

11:06.480 --> 11:09.360
with all the obnoxious free ringtones from circa 2006.

11:09.360 --> 11:11.840
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

11:11.840 --> 11:13.360
That's my impression of Crazy Frog.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.240
These gems include a Blake Shelton

11:16.240 --> 11:18.640
sound like singing Your Hubby is Calling.

11:18.640 --> 11:20.160
Give us a taste of that.

11:20.160 --> 11:23.280
Your hubby is calling.

11:23.280 --> 11:26.960
And a woman shouting, alert, it's your mother-in-law.

11:26.960 --> 11:27.460
Brothers.

11:28.640 --> 11:29.200
Brothers.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.440
I love my mother dearly,

11:31.440 --> 11:35.840
but I can't change another one of her contacts

11:35.840 --> 11:37.760
to one of the corresponding tones.

11:37.760 --> 11:38.260
Help.

11:38.260 --> 11:38.760
Help.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.580
That's from Audibly Arrayed in Austin.

11:40.580 --> 11:41.540
That's my city.

11:41.540 --> 11:42.340
I don't want to hear that.

11:42.340 --> 11:43.380
That's polluting your air.

11:43.380 --> 11:45.380
I don't want to be at Whole Foods in here.

11:45.380 --> 11:47.060
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

11:47.060 --> 11:50.500
Your hubby is calling to die.

11:50.500 --> 11:51.140
That's Blake.

11:51.140 --> 11:52.260
Why don't you make a deal with her

11:53.060 --> 11:54.420
that they're all very annoying,

11:54.420 --> 11:57.780
so you're gonna put them all into one single ringtone

11:57.780 --> 11:59.060
that she has to use for everything.

11:59.060 --> 12:01.460
Oh, and then she can only use it when you're calling,

12:01.460 --> 12:02.820
because then you'll never be around.

12:02.820 --> 12:05.220
Let's give a sampler what that would sound like.

12:05.220 --> 12:10.260
Three, two, one.

12:10.260 --> 12:11.380
That would be pretty good.

12:11.380 --> 12:12.900
I think that would be a pretty good ringtone.

12:12.900 --> 12:13.860
And if you want to take that,

12:13.860 --> 12:14.660
and you want to cut that out,

12:14.660 --> 12:15.860
make it a WAV file,

12:15.860 --> 12:17.460
maybe an M4A file,

12:17.460 --> 12:19.460
attach that to all our contacts.

12:19.460 --> 12:20.420
Maybe a GIF.

12:20.420 --> 12:22.020
When we call you, we want that sound.

12:22.020 --> 12:24.260
Yeah, this is basically Prairie Home fucking campaign.

12:24.260 --> 12:25.940
Or wait, wait, don't fucking tell.

12:27.460 --> 12:27.960
Yeah.

12:30.100 --> 12:33.300
This sucks, and that person at AT&T store should feel bad.

12:33.300 --> 12:34.740
Did they upsell them?

12:34.740 --> 12:35.380
Why do you...

12:35.380 --> 12:37.940
No, probably didn't upsell them on this shitty ringtone app.

12:37.940 --> 12:39.780
No, it was probably another 60 year old was like,

12:39.780 --> 12:40.980
hold up, you gonna love this.

12:40.980 --> 12:42.580
Hold on, players.

12:42.580 --> 12:44.100
You're gonna love this app.

12:44.100 --> 12:45.140
You think about going with that...

12:48.340 --> 12:50.180
No, put that away, put that away.

12:50.180 --> 12:51.060
I got something for you.

12:51.060 --> 12:52.580
Ring, ring, I'm a phone.

12:52.580 --> 12:53.300
Do you like that?

12:54.020 --> 12:54.580
I do.

12:54.580 --> 12:56.020
I got more where that came from.

12:56.020 --> 12:56.900
I do like that.

12:56.900 --> 12:57.140
Check this out.

12:57.140 --> 12:58.340
First taste is free.

12:58.340 --> 12:58.980
Check this out.

12:59.860 --> 13:01.620
No, of course, it's not the real Tim Allen.

13:02.580 --> 13:03.460
I like it though.

13:03.460 --> 13:04.900
We couldn't get the real Tim Allen.

13:04.900 --> 13:05.940
It's close enough for me.

13:05.940 --> 13:06.980
I'm not a proud woman.

13:09.140 --> 13:10.180
You got text.

13:11.300 --> 13:13.380
You really have your finger on my pulse here.

13:13.380 --> 13:14.340
We got Rim Allen.

13:14.980 --> 13:15.480
Sorry?

13:16.660 --> 13:17.380
Rim Allen.

13:18.020 --> 13:18.660
Do you know how...

13:18.660 --> 13:19.860
Is that Tim's nephew?

13:19.860 --> 13:22.100
Do you know how in Zelda there's...

13:22.100 --> 13:22.740
I don't know.

13:22.740 --> 13:23.620
You've lost me already.

13:23.620 --> 13:24.660
I'm a 60 year old woman.

13:24.660 --> 13:25.460
There's Dark Link.

13:26.580 --> 13:27.700
That's what Rim Allen is.

13:28.980 --> 13:30.180
Rim Allen is Dark Link?

13:30.740 --> 13:31.220
For Tim Allen.

13:31.220 --> 13:32.660
Oh, for Tim Allen, there's a metaphor.

13:32.660 --> 13:33.940
Shadow world version.

13:33.940 --> 13:35.540
You got any other ringtones on there?

13:35.540 --> 13:36.340
I might have to pay...

13:36.340 --> 13:37.940
These are probably like $100, right?

13:38.500 --> 13:40.420
I'm probably gonna pay $100 for this ringtone app.

13:41.140 --> 13:42.740
$100 a ringtone?

13:42.740 --> 13:43.460
$100 a ringtone.

13:43.460 --> 13:44.900
How many bitcoins does this cost?

13:44.900 --> 13:46.420
I hear my grandchildren talk about it.

13:46.420 --> 13:49.140
How much would you expect to pay in bitcoins for this ringtone app?

13:49.140 --> 13:49.620
Christ.

13:50.420 --> 13:51.700
Four kilobytes.

13:51.700 --> 13:52.660
At least four kilobytes.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.180
I mean, you can delete it and she'll never find it.

13:56.180 --> 13:56.740
She won't find it again.

13:56.740 --> 13:58.100
She'll never find it again.

13:58.100 --> 14:03.460
But then when somebody calls her, it's just gonna be like...

14:03.460 --> 14:04.260
Read another question.

14:05.620 --> 14:06.820
Not a lot of people sent...

14:06.820 --> 14:09.460
I got some great yahoos this week, but not a lot of people sent in yahoos.

14:09.460 --> 14:12.020
I guess they were celebrating the Christ child.

14:13.060 --> 14:17.460
My desk is located next to both the kitchen and mailboxes at work.

14:19.540 --> 14:22.500
I have a young coworker who literally every time she walks past my desk

14:22.500 --> 14:24.100
asks in a sing-song voice,

14:24.100 --> 14:24.980
How's it going?

14:25.780 --> 14:27.860
And actually expects an answer.

14:27.860 --> 14:31.860
At first, I answered her honestly, but lately I've been getting annoyed

14:31.860 --> 14:32.660
and will just say,

14:32.660 --> 14:33.380
Fine.

14:33.380 --> 14:34.740
It's going fine.

14:34.740 --> 14:37.300
Or, you know...

14:37.860 --> 14:41.780
Brothers, can you help me come up with some different ways to answer this woman

14:41.780 --> 14:45.620
who demands to know how it's going five to eight times a day?

14:45.620 --> 14:49.220
That's from It's Going Freaking Fine in Columbus.

14:49.220 --> 14:49.540
Bless you.

14:49.540 --> 14:52.580
We had a genuine my brother, my brother and me sneeze on the scene.

14:52.580 --> 14:53.380
You heard it here first.

14:53.380 --> 14:54.100
You heard it here first.

14:54.100 --> 14:58.100
Can't edit that one over out because we are recording one track.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.100
I think this is why people come up with idioms.

15:02.100 --> 15:04.980
I think it's why our dad speaks almost exclusively in idioms at this point.

15:05.540 --> 15:09.060
He is basically just a ringtone app of idioms at this point

15:09.060 --> 15:11.700
because you just want to have fun stuff to say like,

15:11.700 --> 15:12.420
How's it going?

15:12.420 --> 15:13.300
Fire and frogs here.

15:13.300 --> 15:14.660
Split four ways.

15:14.660 --> 15:15.540
That's what that is.

15:15.540 --> 15:16.180
You realize that, right?

15:16.180 --> 15:16.980
That's a good jam.

15:17.700 --> 15:18.980
Fire and frogs here.

15:18.980 --> 15:19.940
Split four ways.

15:19.940 --> 15:22.180
And if you want to get a little fancy,

15:22.180 --> 15:25.060
if you can nail the execution, split four ways and sand it down.

15:25.060 --> 15:26.260
Now, that's a harder.

15:26.260 --> 15:26.660
That's a harder.

15:26.660 --> 15:27.700
You got to nail it this way.

15:27.700 --> 15:28.580
You got to nail it this way.

15:28.580 --> 15:31.140
It's going to be hard to make that frog stand that stand.

15:31.140 --> 15:33.460
The good thing about fire than frogs here is

15:33.460 --> 15:35.700
if you don't know it and you probably don't,

15:35.700 --> 15:37.700
the person's still kind of like chewing on it

15:37.700 --> 15:40.740
and you have plenty of time to push them over and run away.

15:40.740 --> 15:40.980
Yeah.

15:41.620 --> 15:44.900
You can push them into an open trash can and then run.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.020
Don't be so confused.

15:46.020 --> 15:49.300
Is it possible she's just been waiting for you to turn it around

15:49.300 --> 15:52.900
and she's not doing so hot and you don't say like,

15:52.900 --> 15:54.260
well, no, how are you?

15:54.260 --> 15:55.860
And then she's just got to break.

15:55.860 --> 15:57.140
It's like, oh, my God.

15:57.140 --> 15:58.180
I'm glad you asked.

15:58.180 --> 15:58.900
I'm so glad.

15:58.900 --> 15:59.780
It's because I've been waiting.

15:59.780 --> 16:00.580
I'm the worst.

16:00.580 --> 16:02.660
Is she doing like Joey from Friends?

16:02.660 --> 16:03.860
Like, how's it going?

16:06.020 --> 16:07.060
I'm sorry.

16:07.060 --> 16:07.780
Want some more?

16:08.740 --> 16:10.020
How's it going?

16:10.020 --> 16:10.820
He got worse.

16:11.540 --> 16:12.100
Joey's melting.

16:12.100 --> 16:12.900
Joey's melting.

16:12.900 --> 16:18.180
Joey's melting.

16:18.180 --> 16:21.700
If you had asked us in like season one,

16:21.700 --> 16:22.740
My Brother, My Brother, Me,

16:22.740 --> 16:24.180
I probably would have said something funny.

16:24.180 --> 16:26.420
And like, but this is like nothing.

16:26.420 --> 16:27.620
This is a non-issue.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.700
Like when did, what season are we in now?

16:29.700 --> 16:30.580
And when did season one end?

16:30.580 --> 16:32.740
I think the Canalized Specialists are season one finale,

16:32.740 --> 16:33.300
which by the way,

16:33.300 --> 16:36.020
thanks for tuning into the thrilling season premiere,

16:36.020 --> 16:36.580
season two.

16:37.780 --> 16:39.060
Someone dies.

16:39.620 --> 16:41.460
Someone flies.

16:41.460 --> 16:42.260
Save the cheerleader.

16:42.260 --> 16:42.740
Save the world.

16:44.340 --> 16:45.620
I just feel like this is like,

16:46.180 --> 16:47.780
she's asking how's it going

16:47.780 --> 16:49.780
and she just happens to be the other person

16:49.780 --> 16:51.540
that's kind of interested in the answer.

16:52.100 --> 16:53.780
Like there's way worse people

16:53.780 --> 16:55.700
that you will encounter in work.

16:55.700 --> 16:57.700
Like that's not that bad.

16:57.700 --> 16:59.460
But you have to give it up

16:59.460 --> 17:02.340
for the fact that this person got the worst desk, right?

17:02.340 --> 17:05.220
Is right next to all the shit.

17:05.220 --> 17:06.820
It's a high traffic area.

17:06.820 --> 17:07.620
You don't want that.

17:07.620 --> 17:08.900
You want a secret cubby hole.

17:08.900 --> 17:13.300
How else are you gonna look at funny videos on E-bombs world?

17:13.300 --> 17:15.140
Can you just respond like it's going great.

17:15.140 --> 17:16.980
Thanks for asking every time.

17:16.980 --> 17:17.700
And like-

17:17.700 --> 17:19.140
And try to wear her down.

17:19.140 --> 17:20.020
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

17:20.020 --> 17:21.540
But you have to do it in like a pleasant.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.300
Like I'm not like, oh, it's fine.

17:23.300 --> 17:24.180
Thanks for asking.

17:24.180 --> 17:25.460
Say like, fine, thanks for asking.

17:25.460 --> 17:26.740
Fine, thanks for asking.

17:26.740 --> 17:28.180
But exactly the same.

17:28.180 --> 17:30.820
That's not, that is not gonna have the desired effect.

17:30.820 --> 17:32.260
I feel like if you drop a fireman frog's hair,

17:32.260 --> 17:33.700
split four ways and stand it down.

17:33.700 --> 17:35.060
Every time she asks you,

17:35.060 --> 17:37.220
she is going to stop asking you.

17:37.220 --> 17:38.500
No, because then

17:38.500 --> 17:40.660
you're the funny, cute one who uses that.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.980
And now it's a thing between the two of you.

17:42.980 --> 17:44.500
And you always say like, oh, how's it going?

17:44.500 --> 17:46.020
Fireman frog hair split four ways.

17:46.020 --> 17:47.060
She's like, that's our thing.

17:47.060 --> 17:49.300
You do that eight times a day for a year.

17:49.300 --> 17:50.420
You're not a cute, funny one.

17:50.420 --> 17:51.540
You're a Cyberman.

17:52.180 --> 17:53.620
Oh, can you do it just flat?

17:53.620 --> 17:54.420
Like no effect.

17:54.420 --> 17:56.980
Fireman frog hair split four ways.

17:57.700 --> 17:59.060
Why don't you look her dead in the eye

17:59.700 --> 18:02.980
and grab her, grab her necktie and pull her real close.

18:02.980 --> 18:03.300
Okay.

18:03.300 --> 18:04.500
Is this Paula Poundstone?

18:04.500 --> 18:07.700
Grab her necktie, pull her real close

18:07.700 --> 18:10.420
and just get in her ear and say, diarrhea.

18:12.980 --> 18:13.620
Every time.

18:13.620 --> 18:14.500
A little added effect there,

18:14.500 --> 18:16.100
Justin went beyond the pop filter.

18:16.100 --> 18:17.780
Go beyond the pop filter again.

18:17.780 --> 18:18.340
Diarrhea.

18:18.340 --> 18:19.380
Can you tell the difference?

18:19.380 --> 18:20.580
There was a little bit of pop in there

18:20.580 --> 18:21.380
and some diarrhea.

18:21.940 --> 18:22.660
You wanna Yahoo?

18:22.660 --> 18:22.900
Yeah.

18:24.260 --> 18:26.180
This Yahoo was sent in by Drew Davenport.

18:26.180 --> 18:28.020
Let's all get really comfortable with each other, okay?

18:28.020 --> 18:29.060
Thanks, Drew Davenport.

18:29.060 --> 18:31.140
You are a miracle boy.

18:31.140 --> 18:33.860
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user.

18:34.660 --> 18:36.420
And since he's finally starting to kick in, huh?

18:36.420 --> 18:38.820
Oh yeah, it does not smell like poop in here as much anymore.

18:38.820 --> 18:39.540
So thank you for that.

18:39.540 --> 18:41.460
We're recording in the same room

18:41.460 --> 18:44.100
that my cat litter box is.

18:44.660 --> 18:46.580
And usually I'm very diligent about cleaning up.

18:46.580 --> 18:47.780
But you know, it's the holidays.

18:47.780 --> 18:48.900
You let things slide.

18:49.460 --> 18:50.820
You wrap them up as presents.

18:50.820 --> 18:52.420
You wrap them up as presents.

18:52.420 --> 18:53.540
You feed them to your baby.

18:55.140 --> 18:56.420
Amy Sue Harris asks,

18:56.420 --> 18:59.540
I know, dry hump advice?

18:59.540 --> 19:01.220
I know it sounds stupid,

19:01.220 --> 19:03.940
but for a 15-year-old hormone-enraged girl

19:03.940 --> 19:06.660
who can't go on the pill and whose boyfriend isn't ready,

19:06.660 --> 19:09.060
it's a pretty smart way to pleasure both of us.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.220
This person is 32.

19:11.220 --> 19:14.420
Shh, pretty new to our relationship though.

19:14.420 --> 19:15.940
And I have some questions.

19:15.940 --> 19:17.300
How do I position ourselves?

19:17.300 --> 19:18.340
So it's like his,

19:20.740 --> 19:21.940
that's what it says,

19:21.940 --> 19:28.020
is rubbing right against my arm so it's more enjoyable.

19:28.020 --> 19:30.900
And is it better as fast and hard?

19:30.900 --> 19:32.500
And what's the best way to do it?

19:32.500 --> 19:34.580
Usually I wear tights and he wears jeans.

19:34.580 --> 19:36.020
Tips? Thank you.

19:36.820 --> 19:38.900
Valerie, clear our schedule.

19:38.900 --> 19:41.060
We're doing the rest of the show

19:41.060 --> 19:43.780
about how to teach teens on dry humping.

19:43.780 --> 19:45.780
Oh, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.

19:46.340 --> 19:47.700
Is this legal hot waters?

19:47.700 --> 19:49.300
Because this is a 15-year-old.

19:49.300 --> 19:51.460
No, because it's not a 15-year-old.

19:51.460 --> 19:52.820
It's not a 15-year-old, Griffin.

19:52.820 --> 19:55.220
This is not worded how a 15-year-old would ask.

19:55.220 --> 19:59.060
When you say things like his ahem and my ahem,

19:59.060 --> 20:00.740
this is a 40-year-old woman.

20:01.460 --> 20:03.220
Trying to dry hump a 15-year-old boy.

20:03.220 --> 20:05.460
Yeah, like, hey, I need some tips.

20:05.460 --> 20:07.780
Now that'll sound weird if I say I'm a 40-year-old

20:07.780 --> 20:08.980
trying to hump a 15-year-old.

20:08.980 --> 20:10.580
Yeah, try that, it might sound a bit weird.

20:10.580 --> 20:11.540
Oh, I know.

20:11.540 --> 20:13.300
I'll say I am also 15.

20:13.300 --> 20:16.260
Here, let's just give general dry hump advice

20:16.260 --> 20:17.380
into the ether.

20:17.380 --> 20:19.620
And then if it hits this 15-year-old, cool, cool.

20:19.620 --> 20:20.980
If they catch it like dry humping.

20:20.980 --> 20:22.100
Like big butterflies.

20:22.100 --> 20:25.300
How long can we give dry hump advice to teens

20:25.300 --> 20:26.660
before our wives come in?

20:26.660 --> 20:28.740
At least one is like, stop.

20:28.740 --> 20:29.300
Stop it.

20:29.300 --> 20:29.860
Stop it.

20:29.860 --> 20:31.540
Guys, stop it.

20:31.540 --> 20:32.260
No.

20:32.260 --> 20:32.820
Stop it.

20:33.860 --> 20:34.740
Dry scissoring.

20:37.460 --> 20:39.220
Just like lead off with that, Justin.

20:39.220 --> 20:40.500
That's good for placement.

20:41.140 --> 20:41.860
You know what I like?

20:41.860 --> 20:43.460
A nice side-by-side dry hump

20:43.460 --> 20:45.940
where you just rub your legs together like crickets

20:45.940 --> 20:48.020
and you just get some friction in your jeans.

20:48.020 --> 20:49.220
Yeah, fire hazard, though.

20:49.220 --> 20:50.100
You gotta watch out for that.

20:50.100 --> 20:52.020
Oh, yeah, don't get no sandpaper in there.

20:52.020 --> 20:52.340
Ooh.

20:52.340 --> 20:54.260
You're saying you preheat the oven

20:54.260 --> 20:57.220
by rubbing your zone to get it super friction hot

20:57.220 --> 20:59.220
and then you touch it gingerly against it?

20:59.220 --> 21:01.060
No, that's how you build up static electricity

21:01.060 --> 21:02.900
and then you poke them in the face and shock them.

21:02.900 --> 21:04.020
Some dudes like that.

21:04.020 --> 21:04.740
That's all I'm saying.

21:04.740 --> 21:06.180
Some dudes are into that.

21:06.180 --> 21:08.740
One thing is you can put a sandpaper patch

21:08.740 --> 21:10.180
on your front of your jeans

21:10.180 --> 21:12.500
and that can give you some really good traction

21:12.500 --> 21:13.940
when you're dry humping.

21:13.940 --> 21:14.420
You know what?

21:15.620 --> 21:17.460
What I like is the old sit and spin.

21:18.020 --> 21:18.660
Oh, yeah?

21:18.660 --> 21:20.500
Yeah, where you both sit on sit and spins

21:20.500 --> 21:21.620
and just play with them.

21:21.620 --> 21:23.300
I like the double wrecking ball.

21:23.300 --> 21:24.020
How does that work?

21:25.220 --> 21:25.700
Let me think.

21:27.140 --> 21:29.860
If you gotta be on some sort of swing,

21:29.860 --> 21:33.060
some sort of rope, lever, attach to the ceiling,

21:33.060 --> 21:35.540
and then the two of you just sort of go like this

21:35.540 --> 21:37.620
and you just sort of swing into each other over and over again.

21:39.620 --> 21:40.180
That's pretty good.

21:40.180 --> 21:41.060
You just smash it together.

21:41.060 --> 21:42.420
How about the mortar and pestle?

21:42.420 --> 21:43.700
And that's where you dry hump,

21:43.700 --> 21:47.300
but you put some barley down there

21:47.300 --> 21:48.580
and you grind it up when you're done.

21:48.580 --> 21:50.100
And when you're done, you have ground up barley.

21:50.740 --> 21:53.220
I like the kind of dry humping where you dry hump so hard

21:53.220 --> 21:55.060
that I guess some stuff just got through,

21:55.060 --> 21:56.820
or at least that's what I told my gynecologist.

21:58.020 --> 22:00.020
Wow, a lot going on there.

22:00.580 --> 22:04.180
I think that one of the weirdest things about dry humping

22:04.180 --> 22:05.460
is I feel like it has...

22:06.100 --> 22:08.020
What are the weirdest things about dry humping?

22:08.020 --> 22:10.180
There's a sentence I want to hear my middle brother say.

22:10.180 --> 22:10.740
Hit me.

22:10.740 --> 22:12.900
I'm just thinking about like that there must be

22:12.900 --> 22:16.900
like kind of that age of innocence

22:16.900 --> 22:19.700
because there has to be a point where you suddenly go,

22:19.700 --> 22:20.740
what are we doing?

22:20.740 --> 22:21.540
What are we doing?

22:21.540 --> 22:22.660
This is too dry.

22:24.260 --> 22:25.380
This is dumb.

22:25.380 --> 22:28.180
And I doubt very much that there are 40-year-old people

22:28.180 --> 22:30.740
who are like, hey, let's just dry hump tonight.

22:31.380 --> 22:33.140
Because then you're just looking going, what are we doing?

22:33.140 --> 22:35.140
Hey, I got an idea to spice things up.

22:35.140 --> 22:36.580
Let's reduce the moisture.

22:37.620 --> 22:38.900
What are we doing?

22:38.900 --> 22:41.300
And so it's almost like this very innocent,

22:41.300 --> 22:42.980
but also very weird thing.

22:44.900 --> 22:46.660
You know how much it would please me

22:46.660 --> 22:48.180
if they dry hump?

22:48.180 --> 22:51.140
Just right now for once, to just feel young again.

22:51.140 --> 22:52.420
Probably not like a lot.

22:52.420 --> 22:54.260
Do you think people ever dry hump for the novel?

22:54.260 --> 22:55.700
Are you feeling young again?

22:55.700 --> 22:56.340
Yeah.

22:56.340 --> 22:59.860
Just like the same way you'd like go to see

22:59.860 --> 23:02.900
a Backstreet Boys reunion tour.

23:02.900 --> 23:03.620
And dry hump.

23:03.620 --> 23:06.740
And dry hump all the Backstreet Boys in sequence.

23:06.740 --> 23:07.620
Just to feel young.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.060
Wait, in what sequence?

23:09.060 --> 23:10.500
What's the proper sequence?

23:10.500 --> 23:13.140
I will unlock the Pharaoh's tomb.

23:13.140 --> 23:19.700
OK, it's JC, Tori, Jody, December, Big Ralph.

23:19.700 --> 23:21.700
OK, if you do it in that order.

23:21.700 --> 23:23.380
Sorry, was one of them called December?

23:24.020 --> 23:26.340
Yeah, December was one of them.

23:26.340 --> 23:28.820
Tori, Jody, December, Big Ralph.

23:28.820 --> 23:29.460
Chazes.

23:29.460 --> 23:30.260
And Chazes.

23:30.260 --> 23:31.220
They're all brothers.

23:31.220 --> 23:32.660
You sweep back around.

23:32.660 --> 23:33.300
That's the scene, guys.

23:33.300 --> 23:34.500
All right, nobody's popping up in the tomb.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.420
And while Justin's going to be a very rich man very soon,

23:36.420 --> 23:39.380
very rich with locusts, you got to swoop back around

23:39.380 --> 23:40.660
and get JC again.

23:40.660 --> 23:43.620
So can you imagine the last-

23:43.620 --> 23:45.780
By that point, you will have worn holes in your jeans.

23:45.780 --> 23:46.340
Right.

23:46.340 --> 23:49.540
The last five minutes of our show being transcribed,

23:49.540 --> 23:51.940
and Dave Barry just hands it to his editor.

23:51.940 --> 23:53.060
This is my new book.

23:53.060 --> 23:55.220
Weird stuff about dry humping by Dave Barry.

23:55.220 --> 23:56.260
I'm not sure, Dave.

23:56.260 --> 23:57.460
I don't think you've got a hit.

23:57.460 --> 23:58.980
Forward by JC Chazes.

24:00.180 --> 24:01.140
Please leave me alone.

24:01.140 --> 24:02.100
Please, please, please.

24:02.100 --> 24:03.620
I don't know where the treasure is.

24:03.620 --> 24:05.620
I don't know how many times I have to tell you.

24:05.620 --> 24:06.660
Please stop dry humping me.

24:06.660 --> 24:07.860
I haven't dry humped in months.

24:07.860 --> 24:10.580
Stop talking about me.

24:10.580 --> 24:12.980
Keep my name out your mouth when you're talking about dry humping.

24:14.340 --> 24:16.740
What are some other great things to say about dry humping out loud?

24:18.500 --> 24:20.020
It's better than impact humping.

24:20.580 --> 24:24.900
Is dry humping, is that a gateway, do you think?

24:24.900 --> 24:27.620
You go from dry humping to like arid humping?

24:27.620 --> 24:30.500
Yeah, you got to make sure it's the gateway in the right direction

24:30.500 --> 24:31.940
to hydrated humping.

24:31.940 --> 24:35.380
And then you got, you got, you have to get your electrolytes.

24:35.380 --> 24:35.860
You can't be-

24:35.860 --> 24:36.820
Oh my God.

24:36.820 --> 24:38.420
Oh, it's so easy.

24:38.420 --> 24:41.940
Don't try to, don't try to dry hump without talcum powder on hand.

24:41.940 --> 24:42.740
Something.

24:42.740 --> 24:43.220
Something.

24:43.940 --> 24:45.300
Should we go to the money ton?

24:45.300 --> 24:46.580
I feel like we're already there.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.460
This week, talcum powder.

24:49.460 --> 24:51.060
Put it down there, you have to.

25:00.740 --> 25:04.020
Guys, we have a return of a classic sponsor,

25:04.020 --> 25:07.140
and this is one that I'm real big into, one month.

25:07.140 --> 25:07.780
Here's a fact.

25:08.900 --> 25:10.100
Have we made that joke yet?

25:10.100 --> 25:10.500
No.

25:10.500 --> 25:10.980
Finish it.

25:16.260 --> 25:17.380
If you want a chicken.

25:17.380 --> 25:21.300
If you want to code a website that demands the death of Griffin McElroy

25:21.300 --> 25:23.380
for the last 15 seconds of audio.

25:23.380 --> 25:24.340
You cannot kill me.

25:25.540 --> 25:27.060
I opened the Pharaoh's tomb.

25:31.060 --> 25:31.540
That weird.

25:31.540 --> 25:32.020
Coding.

25:32.020 --> 25:36.260
Coding was the most in demand job skill of 2014.

25:36.260 --> 25:36.980
That is one of them.

25:37.620 --> 25:38.980
Peanut butter will be 2015.

25:38.980 --> 25:40.340
You heard it here first, I'm guessing.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.740
Here's my thing to you, okay?

25:44.740 --> 25:46.260
Your 2014 was a little rough.

25:46.260 --> 25:48.580
Fine, fine, fine, fine.

25:48.580 --> 25:49.380
Are you talking to everyone?

25:49.380 --> 25:50.980
Cause it was pretty much rough room.

25:50.980 --> 25:52.420
Yeah, but you know how we're going to fix it.

25:52.420 --> 25:53.620
We're all going to learn how to code.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.140
We're going to code our way right out of here.

25:56.500 --> 25:59.860
In 2015, you're going to learn how to code with one month rails.

25:59.860 --> 26:01.700
Imagine you can build your website overnight.

26:01.700 --> 26:04.500
Imagine that your resume could stand out when you're applying for a job.

26:04.500 --> 26:05.860
That's like how I'm imagining.

26:05.860 --> 26:09.460
One month rails is the easiest way to learn how to code.

26:09.460 --> 26:13.140
You can learn Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, GYAT.

26:14.100 --> 26:15.220
I don't know what GYAT is.

26:15.220 --> 26:15.940
GYAT.

26:15.940 --> 26:16.660
GYAT.

26:16.660 --> 26:17.160
GYAT.

26:17.540 --> 26:18.500
You can learn all that stuff.

26:18.500 --> 26:18.820
I haven't-

26:18.820 --> 26:20.340
That's why you said all the bugs in your code.

26:20.340 --> 26:20.820
GYAT.

26:20.820 --> 26:24.580
I have done a one month course on HTML.

26:25.300 --> 26:28.740
I knew a little bit beforehand, but it was a really good,

26:28.740 --> 26:31.060
I mean, not just a refresher because HTML has changed so much

26:31.060 --> 26:37.220
since I made the GeoCities webpage for my band of Vezo in the mid 90s.

26:37.220 --> 26:38.660
It's changed a thing you say.

26:38.660 --> 26:40.500
So has your band of Vezo.

26:40.500 --> 26:40.740
Yeah.

26:40.740 --> 26:44.420
Our sound is very much evolved in that we have been dormant for 15 years.

26:44.420 --> 26:45.940
By the way, Justin is panda bear.

26:45.940 --> 26:46.440
All right.

26:47.460 --> 26:50.340
So it is a really super easy way.

26:50.340 --> 26:53.620
They break it down to where it's like a half hour every day, 30 minutes.

26:53.620 --> 26:56.340
You dip in, you do the lesson for that day.

26:56.340 --> 26:58.180
The biggest problem I had was honestly stopping,

26:58.180 --> 27:01.540
because sometimes I wanted to do another lesson because they're a lot of fun.

27:01.540 --> 27:02.660
They've got other classes too.

27:03.380 --> 27:05.460
One month iOS to help you build an iPhone app.

27:05.460 --> 27:06.820
Whoa, I want to do that one.

27:06.820 --> 27:07.780
That sounds like fun.

27:07.780 --> 27:08.020
Yeah.

27:09.300 --> 27:11.220
One month growth hacking.

27:11.220 --> 27:14.660
That's to get like GBH.

27:15.380 --> 27:17.300
And there's one month HTML.

27:18.100 --> 27:19.060
I took the class.

27:19.060 --> 27:20.340
Like I said, it's great.

27:20.980 --> 27:23.780
30 minutes for 30 days, and then you will have this new skill.

27:23.780 --> 27:24.900
I'm totally going to do that.

27:24.900 --> 27:25.380
App one.

27:25.380 --> 27:25.780
That sounds great.

27:25.780 --> 27:26.500
Yeah, do an app.

27:26.500 --> 27:30.580
I'm going to make an app, because that's what the world needs is more apps.

27:30.580 --> 27:31.380
And how do they do it?

27:31.940 --> 27:34.420
You go to onemonth.com slash my brother.

27:34.420 --> 27:37.940
Now, typically your room is going to be $99, but if you join now,

27:37.940 --> 27:42.660
you're going to get a one time discount of 25% off.

27:42.660 --> 27:46.340
Which I think is going to be like $24.96.

27:46.340 --> 27:48.740
One month is the service.

27:48.740 --> 27:51.700
Again, that address is onemonth.com slash my brother.

27:52.420 --> 27:54.260
You are really going to like one month a lot.

27:54.260 --> 27:55.860
Let's turn around 2015.

27:55.860 --> 27:56.420
You've earned it.

27:56.420 --> 27:57.460
Here's a call to action.

27:58.260 --> 28:02.020
Assemble and check out slash cg.com.

28:02.020 --> 28:03.220
Ship just got real.

28:03.220 --> 28:05.060
I guess that's the tagline for it.

28:05.060 --> 28:07.220
I think it's short for like friendship.

28:07.220 --> 28:08.580
Or relationship.

28:08.580 --> 28:09.060
Oh, OK.

28:09.700 --> 28:12.340
Games by Playdate is excited to release The Blanks,

28:12.340 --> 28:16.980
a customizable expansion for the hit party game slash romance without boundaries.

28:17.700 --> 28:18.980
Put yourself, your friends, and...

28:20.180 --> 28:20.820
Oh, God.

28:21.540 --> 28:22.180
It's cush.

28:22.180 --> 28:25.540
Put yourself, your friends, and your frenemies in a one true pairing

28:25.540 --> 28:27.380
with your favorite pop culture figures.

28:27.380 --> 28:32.180
Why not add Orb, Glass Shark, Tiny Amelie, or Edward Snowden

28:32.180 --> 28:34.180
to your evening of improv slash fic?

28:34.180 --> 28:37.300
I don't know who any of those things are or what they're referring to.

28:37.300 --> 28:40.580
My Bim Bam won't care that you've got them making pretend romance

28:40.580 --> 28:43.380
to She-Ra or Rasputin, probably.

28:43.380 --> 28:44.420
Well, uh...

28:44.420 --> 28:48.580
True love can't be stopped by time, space, logic, or literary canon.

28:48.580 --> 28:49.940
Hey, that's not true.

28:49.940 --> 28:52.260
Space, logic, or literary canon.

28:52.260 --> 28:55.140
Hey, fuck the shit out of Rasputin.

28:55.140 --> 28:55.940
I don't give a damn.

28:55.940 --> 28:57.940
Games by Playdate, they're great.

28:57.940 --> 29:02.420
They've been big supporters of our show, and we're huge fans of theirs.

29:02.420 --> 29:05.380
They sent me a couple games and everything, just out of the goodness of their heart.

29:05.380 --> 29:08.340
There's a Shakespeare game that they sent me that I cannot wait to play.

29:08.340 --> 29:10.020
They made a Sawbones game.

29:10.020 --> 29:11.860
They made 13 Dead in Drive.

29:11.860 --> 29:13.140
They made that board game.

29:13.140 --> 29:14.500
I'm gonna send it back in time.

29:14.500 --> 29:15.060
Kerplunk?

29:15.060 --> 29:16.820
By the way, guys, I have 13 Dead in Drive.

29:16.820 --> 29:18.100
You wanna play some fucking 13 Dead in Drive?

29:18.100 --> 29:19.060
Stop the show now.

29:19.060 --> 29:21.540
A copy of 13 Dead in Drive has ever worked once.

29:21.540 --> 29:22.740
That game's busted.

29:22.740 --> 29:24.740
It's a combination of Clue and Mousetrap.

29:24.740 --> 29:25.300
Enjoy!

29:25.300 --> 29:26.100
And Broken Shit.

29:26.100 --> 29:28.100
So, check out slash CG.com.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.700
Ship just got real.

29:29.700 --> 29:32.500
Just got another message for Toby, and it's from Zach Sasha.

29:32.500 --> 29:33.780
Another message for Toby.

29:33.780 --> 29:35.060
Yep, he just keeps getting them.

29:35.060 --> 29:37.060
We've probably done a Toby message at some point.

29:37.060 --> 29:40.260
It's from Zach, Sasha, and Jake, who say,

29:40.260 --> 29:45.060
Dear Toby slash Dink Joe slash Swaday.

29:46.020 --> 29:46.660
Swaday.

29:46.660 --> 29:49.060
Swaday.

29:49.060 --> 29:50.180
Shaday.

29:50.180 --> 29:51.060
Shaday.

29:51.060 --> 29:54.260
Congratulations on being born 27 goat years ago.

29:54.820 --> 29:59.060
You read so many books, know so many things, and frown so much.

29:59.060 --> 30:01.700
We, not Zach, adore your curls.

30:01.700 --> 30:02.020
Wow.

30:02.020 --> 30:05.140
Your feminine cardigans and your obnoxious t-shoes.

30:05.140 --> 30:07.780
I said t's, but your t's are probably fucked up too.

30:08.580 --> 30:12.660
Your bi-weekly grumpy visits almost make up for you moving out,

30:12.660 --> 30:16.420
and we're all proud of your literary success and smoke-free lungs.

30:16.420 --> 30:16.740
Love.

30:17.940 --> 30:18.580
Love.

30:18.580 --> 30:18.900
Love.

30:18.900 --> 30:19.780
Love.

30:19.780 --> 30:20.580
Love.

30:20.580 --> 30:22.580
Sorry about your curls.

30:22.580 --> 30:26.180
Toby, it sounds like you're getting your life together vis-a-vis smoking.

30:26.180 --> 30:27.380
I do wish you would smile.

30:27.380 --> 30:28.260
Turn that frown upside down.

30:28.260 --> 30:29.780
Turn that frown upside down.

30:29.780 --> 30:31.780
You don't have to worry about nicotine stains anymore.

30:31.780 --> 30:32.900
Let's get that smile going.

30:33.620 --> 30:34.580
Hey, baby girl.

30:34.580 --> 30:35.220
Hey.

30:35.220 --> 30:35.460
Hey.

30:35.460 --> 30:36.900
Show me that smile.

30:36.900 --> 30:38.900
Show me that, no, it's right here.

30:38.900 --> 30:41.780
Show me, show me that smile.

30:41.780 --> 30:43.620
Let me try, no, it's up right here.

30:43.620 --> 30:46.980
Show me that smile again.

30:46.980 --> 30:48.580
Show me that smile.

30:49.300 --> 30:54.260
Don't waste another minute on your crying.

30:54.260 --> 30:58.260
We know we're near the end.

30:58.260 --> 31:01.620
The best is ready to begin.

31:06.020 --> 31:09.300
As long as we got each other,

31:09.300 --> 31:16.260
we got the world spinning right in our hands, baby.

31:16.260 --> 31:25.780
You and me, we gotta be the luckiest dreamers who never quit dreaming.

31:28.660 --> 31:29.460
We just made that up.

31:32.580 --> 31:33.780
Excuse me, boys.

31:33.780 --> 31:39.380
I'm Alan Thicke, and all of you are going to prison for a long time.

31:39.380 --> 31:41.540
I'm Canada's Alan Thicke.

31:41.540 --> 31:44.020
Please don't remind anyone I'm related to Thicke.

31:44.020 --> 31:45.540
Oh my god, it's my daughter.

31:45.540 --> 31:46.260
Hi, Charlie Gale.

31:46.260 --> 31:47.460
Hey, Charlie Gale.

31:47.460 --> 31:49.700
In her third costume of the day.

31:49.700 --> 31:50.100
Wow, already?

31:50.100 --> 31:54.500
You just keep on pooping and spitting, pooping and spitting, pooping and spitting.

31:54.500 --> 31:55.780
And we pooped right through it.

31:55.780 --> 31:56.500
Pooped right through it.

31:56.500 --> 31:57.780
Pooped right through it.

31:57.780 --> 31:58.980
Just like we're doing to this show.

31:59.620 --> 32:00.580
Welcome to Vim Bam.

32:00.580 --> 32:02.260
We pooped right through our clothes.

32:02.260 --> 32:03.380
Welcome to Vim Bam.

32:03.380 --> 32:09.380
Our let's just get 45 minutes of audio containing anything ever on the book.

32:09.380 --> 32:11.860
Did we just sing the growing pains theme song?

32:11.860 --> 32:13.140
I don't know, I'm blacked out.

32:13.140 --> 32:14.500
That ain't a good 90 seconds.

32:14.500 --> 32:14.980
That was great.

32:15.620 --> 32:16.260
Hey, everyone.

32:16.260 --> 32:21.060
We're the Flophouse, one of the newest additions to the Maximum Fun podcasting network.

32:21.060 --> 32:22.260
I'm Dan McCoy.

32:22.260 --> 32:23.540
I'm Stuart Wellington.

32:23.540 --> 32:24.980
And I'm Elliott Kalin.

32:24.980 --> 32:27.700
What is the Flophouse, you may very well ask.

32:27.700 --> 32:29.940
We watch a bad movie, and then we talk about it.

32:29.940 --> 32:31.300
A bad movie podcast?

32:31.300 --> 32:33.780
Isn't that like every fifth podcast on the internet?

32:33.780 --> 32:37.460
I'd answer that by saying, one, we've been doing this show for over seven years,

32:37.460 --> 32:40.580
long before the entire premise of our show was a cliche.

32:40.580 --> 32:42.100
And two, shut up.

32:42.100 --> 32:43.300
Sick bird.

32:43.300 --> 32:46.020
I'd say that our show is more of a comedy podcast.

32:46.020 --> 32:48.420
A podcast about words that sound like other words.

32:48.420 --> 32:53.060
A podcast about me singing long irritating songs like this one.

32:53.060 --> 32:56.020
A podcast about pitches for a Ziggy comic book movie.

32:56.020 --> 32:58.260
Or discussions about sex tarps.

32:58.260 --> 33:02.340
Yeah, I mean, mostly it's a show about three friends just hanging out.

33:02.340 --> 33:03.860
And talking about ding dongs.

33:03.860 --> 33:04.900
That's mostly used to.

33:04.900 --> 33:05.780
Wait, what?

33:05.780 --> 33:09.460
So if you like any of those things, subscribe in iTunes today,

33:09.460 --> 33:13.540
or visit MaximumFun.org to follow the show.

33:13.540 --> 33:14.580
The Flophouse.

33:15.460 --> 33:16.980
I work for a small company.

33:16.980 --> 33:20.180
My only everyday coworker is my boss's daughter.

33:21.380 --> 33:21.940
I don't know.

33:22.980 --> 33:24.980
Starring Ashton Kutcher.

33:24.980 --> 33:29.220
We recently moved into a small office, roughly 10 by 15.

33:29.220 --> 33:32.980
And whatever perfume, body spray, or whatever is just overwhelming.

33:33.700 --> 33:35.780
To make it worse, she's a germaphobe

33:35.780 --> 33:40.820
and applies similarly scented hand sanitizer at least every hour.

33:40.820 --> 33:45.860
I'm sitting next to her right now and I have such a headache because of the smell.

33:45.860 --> 33:48.580
To be clear, the scent itself is not unpleasant,

33:48.580 --> 33:52.980
but it's the perfume volume to space ratio that's causing the problem.

33:52.980 --> 33:56.340
Well, I've made subtle general remarks.

33:57.220 --> 33:59.620
She's obviously not picking up on those.

33:59.620 --> 34:01.780
What's the best way to approach this situation?

34:01.780 --> 34:02.900
Do I confront her about it,

34:02.900 --> 34:05.300
or do I find a way to make my experience less miserable?

34:05.300 --> 34:07.300
That's from Stunk Out in St. Louis.

34:08.180 --> 34:09.700
You gotta over stink her.

34:10.340 --> 34:11.620
You have to out stink the stinker.

34:11.620 --> 34:12.580
Gotta do it.

34:12.580 --> 34:16.100
You gotta fight those waves of force with it to fuel you on your own.

34:16.660 --> 34:17.540
And what, how?

34:18.340 --> 34:19.060
Go negative?

34:19.700 --> 34:21.620
Well, you can take the campaign negative.

34:21.620 --> 34:22.500
Suck on the anti-smell.

34:22.500 --> 34:23.780
Yeah, well, cause here's the thing.

34:23.780 --> 34:26.340
She's already a fan of like the positive smells.

34:26.340 --> 34:27.700
You know, she's doing the scents.

34:27.700 --> 34:28.980
She's doing the perfumes.

34:29.540 --> 34:30.820
You gotta go negative.

34:30.820 --> 34:32.980
You gotta take the campaign negative.

34:32.980 --> 34:34.500
Are you talking about stinky bad smells,

34:34.500 --> 34:36.180
or are you talking about negative smell?

34:36.180 --> 34:39.300
Things that, things that possess no smell and-

34:39.300 --> 34:41.540
Some activated carbon in the air.

34:41.540 --> 34:42.020
Yeah.

34:42.020 --> 34:42.820
Something.

34:42.820 --> 34:46.820
Or maybe just go like steaks, like a hearty, like a-

34:46.820 --> 34:47.620
Steak salad?

34:47.620 --> 34:49.380
Yeah, like you get like a steak, you know,

34:49.380 --> 34:55.300
like you get like a, more of a savory smell to combat the sweet.

34:55.300 --> 34:57.780
Get a steak candle and replace the pretty stink

34:57.780 --> 34:58.660
with the right angry stink.

34:58.660 --> 34:58.900
Yeah.

35:00.900 --> 35:03.780
Listen, you could, you could do one thing.

35:05.140 --> 35:10.740
I've seen commercials for like, like Febreze air spray

35:10.740 --> 35:12.420
and according to commercials,

35:12.420 --> 35:14.500
you just like grabs the smell out of the air

35:14.500 --> 35:16.260
and tackles it and brings it down.

35:16.260 --> 35:17.140
Maybe you could try that.

35:17.140 --> 35:19.380
Cause scientifically that makes sense to me.

35:19.380 --> 35:22.020
The Febreze grabs the stink.

35:22.020 --> 35:24.340
It makes a bubble around the stink and then brings it down.

35:24.340 --> 35:25.940
And now you're in the carpet.

35:25.940 --> 35:27.780
Now it's like no, no air.

35:27.780 --> 35:28.660
Is that what it's called?

35:28.660 --> 35:29.300
No air?

35:29.300 --> 35:29.700
You know.

35:29.700 --> 35:30.980
The Febreze no air.

35:30.980 --> 35:33.460
Don't spray too much in an enclosed space.

35:33.460 --> 35:36.420
Because it'll depressurize and you'll be sucked out of the chamber.

35:36.420 --> 35:38.820
Can you put a giant air purifier on your desk

35:38.820 --> 35:40.900
and then when she looks, just give her like a facial expression,

35:40.900 --> 35:43.860
like bleh, P-U, P-U.

35:43.860 --> 35:44.820
Can you say you have an allergy?

35:44.820 --> 35:45.300
That's a good thing.

35:45.300 --> 35:47.220
Oh, oh, an allergy.

35:47.220 --> 35:47.780
That's good.

35:47.780 --> 35:48.420
That's so good.

35:48.420 --> 35:49.940
Do you know what I just thought of?

35:49.940 --> 35:50.900
Is it better than an allergy?

35:50.900 --> 35:51.540
Cause you-

35:51.540 --> 35:52.900
It's a different avenue.

35:52.900 --> 35:53.140
Okay.

35:54.260 --> 35:56.820
Tell her that you read on the internet

35:56.820 --> 35:59.620
that all of these hand scented lotions and perfumes

36:00.180 --> 36:03.780
contain this germ that in like 10% of people

36:03.780 --> 36:07.060
is causing some kind of skin infection or skin irritation.

36:07.060 --> 36:13.380
Oh, so you, her comeuppance for her germaphobia

36:13.380 --> 36:15.540
is that you're gonna force her to lean into her germaphobia.

36:15.540 --> 36:17.620
Okay, so you give me that and I'll be-

36:17.620 --> 36:19.620
You wanna gaslight this poor woman.

36:19.620 --> 36:20.660
I'll be stinky coworker.

36:20.660 --> 36:22.580
You give me that and I'll, let's just see how it goes.

36:22.580 --> 36:22.900
Okay.

36:22.900 --> 36:24.420
Can I get some coffee while you guys are doing this little play?

36:24.420 --> 36:24.740
No, you can't.

36:24.740 --> 36:25.220
Perfect.

36:25.220 --> 36:26.420
You gotta be here as the boss.

36:26.420 --> 36:26.980
You gotta be here.

36:26.980 --> 36:28.900
You have to be this woman's father.

36:28.900 --> 36:29.940
You're the Drew Carey.

36:29.940 --> 36:30.660
Okay.

36:30.660 --> 36:33.300
Listen, you two have a good day working.

36:33.300 --> 36:37.220
I'll be out getting a few rounds of goldfin.

36:37.220 --> 36:38.740
You can't see her, it's in this fiction.

36:38.740 --> 36:42.180
The boss is, half of the boss's mouth is sewn shut apparently.

36:42.180 --> 36:43.380
We work for Harvey Dent.

36:43.380 --> 36:44.900
It was a golf accident.

36:45.540 --> 36:47.220
Have a good workday, kitten.

36:47.860 --> 36:50.660
Don't let this man take away your good smells.

36:50.660 --> 36:51.220
Okay, so the-

36:51.220 --> 36:52.340
Do you remember-

36:52.340 --> 36:53.780
He says that a few weeks.

36:53.780 --> 36:58.100
Remember what mommy said about a good clean girl

36:58.100 --> 37:01.860
smells like roses and flowers and sand and breeze.

37:01.860 --> 37:03.220
We asked you to be the Drew Carey.

37:03.220 --> 37:05.220
You're kind of being the Colin Mochrie right now.

37:05.780 --> 37:06.340
Okay.

37:06.340 --> 37:07.460
Give me the pitch.

37:07.460 --> 37:10.340
Oh, hey, did you, I read, I think it was on Facebook, man.

37:10.340 --> 37:11.140
You're like BuzzFeed.

37:11.140 --> 37:13.060
But they found it like-

37:13.060 --> 37:15.140
I'm watching this from the doorframe.

37:15.140 --> 37:16.420
You better nail it.

37:16.420 --> 37:19.380
0.1% of people have like an allergic reaction.

37:19.380 --> 37:22.260
It's something to do with like this drug or like a germ

37:22.260 --> 37:24.340
or something they found in these hand lotions.

37:24.340 --> 37:25.940
Okay, hold on just a second.

37:26.820 --> 37:28.100
I just Googled it, you're lying.

37:28.740 --> 37:30.660
If you're gonna be this boss in my daughter,

37:30.660 --> 37:32.180
you better have a ring in your pocket.

37:33.300 --> 37:34.420
Hold on, what?

37:34.420 --> 37:36.420
You better be proposing marriage

37:36.420 --> 37:41.460
if you would dare take away her good smell.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.940
She's Dottie's little flower girl.

37:43.940 --> 37:45.380
How about a yahoo?

37:45.380 --> 37:47.380
You're a yahoo out of this office.

37:48.020 --> 37:49.460
Did I just get fired?

37:49.460 --> 37:50.660
Yeah, you both did.

37:50.660 --> 37:51.700
Sorry, get in.

37:51.700 --> 37:52.900
He's too deep in the fiction.

37:52.900 --> 37:55.940
You should have known not to get embroiled with a man like this.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.140
We're gonna have to chloroform.

37:57.140 --> 37:59.300
Tell you how to live your smell.

37:59.300 --> 38:01.780
Somebody flip the factory reset on Justin.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.140
Don't let any man steal your smell.

38:03.140 --> 38:05.540
Somebody hold Justin's power button for five seconds

38:05.540 --> 38:06.260
until the LED lights.

38:06.260 --> 38:07.860
You're a strong sira.

38:07.860 --> 38:09.620
Don't let any man steal your smell.

38:09.620 --> 38:12.100
Okay, Travis, I think you need to take the fuse out of the power box.

38:12.100 --> 38:12.580
Okay.

38:12.580 --> 38:13.380
Okay, here we go.

38:14.020 --> 38:16.180
Posted by Marko Resnick and a few other people.

38:16.180 --> 38:16.580
Thank you.

38:16.580 --> 38:19.700
It's by yahoo answers user Samantha who asks,

38:21.060 --> 38:23.860
I'm throwing a sexy Santa party.

38:24.900 --> 38:28.100
Every year my boyfriend and I throw some sort of Christmas party.

38:28.100 --> 38:30.260
Last year we did a kind of dress up dinner party,

38:30.260 --> 38:32.740
but we were thinking of doing a sexy Santa party this year

38:32.740 --> 38:36.100
and having everyone wear their sexiest PJs.

38:36.100 --> 38:37.540
Any, why Santa then?

38:37.540 --> 38:40.580
Any ideas of other things we can do to make the party sexy?

38:41.860 --> 38:43.700
Oh, we are in our early 20s.

38:43.700 --> 38:44.980
Fucking of course you are.

38:44.980 --> 38:45.700
I hope so.

38:46.580 --> 38:47.620
In case that helps.

38:47.620 --> 38:50.340
I can pinpoint your birth month from this question.

38:51.700 --> 38:52.660
Sexy Santa party.

38:53.940 --> 38:55.620
Santa's already sexy.

38:57.140 --> 39:00.740
He's a man who is very giving and responsible

39:00.740 --> 39:02.980
and takes care of like, yeah.

39:03.620 --> 39:04.820
Here's my question.

39:04.820 --> 39:07.540
How do you propose this to your friend in a way

39:07.540 --> 39:10.260
that all of your friends in a way that they don't go,

39:11.220 --> 39:12.340
do you want to see my bitch?

39:12.340 --> 39:14.420
Do you want to see my dick?

39:14.420 --> 39:15.220
Is that what's up?

39:15.220 --> 39:16.180
Like, how do you say like,

39:16.180 --> 39:17.940
I thought a really fun party would be like,

39:17.940 --> 39:20.180
we all wear see-through clothes and stuff.

39:20.180 --> 39:20.500
Bring it.

39:20.500 --> 39:21.460
Haha, get it?

39:21.460 --> 39:22.500
BYOB.

39:22.500 --> 39:26.500
But the last B stands for Bush because I want to see it.

39:26.500 --> 39:27.460
I want to see it.

39:27.460 --> 39:28.580
Want to see that Bush.

39:29.140 --> 39:29.940
Happy holidays.

39:29.940 --> 39:30.740
Happy holidays.

39:30.740 --> 39:32.660
Show me your Christmas Bush.

39:32.660 --> 39:36.020
Show me your Christmas Bush and bring a covered dish.

39:36.020 --> 39:36.500
But you know what?

39:36.500 --> 39:39.220
Here, I was just thinking that I remember some parties

39:39.220 --> 39:42.100
like in college or like the anything but clothes parties

39:42.100 --> 39:43.220
or like that idea of like,

39:43.860 --> 39:48.180
it was a thing where like you people when you're young,

39:48.180 --> 39:51.380
I almost remember people used to dress sexy

39:51.380 --> 39:52.980
to go to things on purpose.

39:53.700 --> 39:54.820
Is that a thing?

39:54.820 --> 39:56.420
Did that happen or am I dreaming it?

39:56.420 --> 39:57.540
It's like a, it's like a,

39:57.540 --> 39:59.860
it's like an Eyes Wide Shut invitation orgy.

39:59.860 --> 40:01.140
You can't send something out saying,

40:01.140 --> 40:02.740
hey, come on, give up.

40:02.740 --> 40:04.340
You got, it's got to be veiled.

40:04.340 --> 40:06.020
It's got to be thickly, thickly veiled.

40:06.020 --> 40:07.460
They have to be like,

40:07.460 --> 40:09.700
is this going to be an orgy or is it not?

40:09.700 --> 40:12.100
You can't be like, come on and bring your Bush.

40:12.100 --> 40:12.900
You can't do that.

40:12.900 --> 40:14.180
You can't put that on an invitation.

40:14.180 --> 40:14.740
You can't do it.

40:14.740 --> 40:15.940
I won't let you do it.

40:15.940 --> 40:16.900
I won't let you do it.

40:16.900 --> 40:18.660
You can't let somebody just bring their own Bush.

40:18.660 --> 40:20.740
No, this sucks.

40:20.740 --> 40:21.620
Bush optional.

40:22.180 --> 40:24.100
Why is it sexy Santa if they're wearing PJs?

40:24.100 --> 40:26.260
You're waiting for Santa sexily.

40:26.260 --> 40:28.100
Oh, then they call it Santa baby.

40:28.100 --> 40:29.540
No, that could be misleading.

40:29.540 --> 40:30.820
People could show up as giant Santa baby.

40:30.820 --> 40:33.140
Do you think Santa actually still comes down the chimney

40:33.140 --> 40:34.580
of like five houses a year

40:34.580 --> 40:38.100
and he picks it based on this very specific criteria?

40:38.100 --> 40:39.620
Like, uh-oh, Bush party.

40:40.340 --> 40:41.460
Gotta get down.

40:41.460 --> 40:43.300
No, put Biloxi on the list.

40:43.300 --> 40:45.940
If he doesn't, I think we've proved that he doesn't exist

40:45.940 --> 40:48.580
because like that would be the party that I'd stop at.

40:48.580 --> 40:49.460
Come down the chimney like,

40:49.460 --> 40:51.460
Bush, Bush, Bush, Bush, Bush, Bush, cool.

40:51.460 --> 40:52.740
Y'all been naughty.

40:52.740 --> 40:54.820
And then he vanishes.

40:54.820 --> 40:58.340
If you want you and all your young attractive friends

40:58.340 --> 41:00.100
to be basically naked together,

41:00.740 --> 41:02.900
don't drag Santa into this.

41:02.900 --> 41:04.100
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

41:04.100 --> 41:07.620
This is all pretense to like Christmas time follies.

41:07.620 --> 41:09.860
I want to think that this is like their six year

41:09.860 --> 41:12.020
hosting this party and they've put up

41:12.020 --> 41:14.660
with boring ass themes for five years,

41:14.660 --> 41:17.300
just building up like the equity

41:17.300 --> 41:19.460
to be able to get all their friends naked.

41:19.460 --> 41:22.020
I would worry about if you call it a sexy Santa party,

41:22.020 --> 41:23.220
you're going to have people show up

41:23.220 --> 41:26.980
with like just ripped red overalls,

41:26.980 --> 41:28.580
like to show their muscles coming through

41:28.580 --> 41:32.580
and like not a beard so much as like a stubble,

41:32.580 --> 41:34.740
like white stubble and just shredded.

41:36.100 --> 41:37.140
Wait, why is that a worry?

41:38.340 --> 41:40.900
You're worried about starting a sexy clothes party

41:40.900 --> 41:41.700
is that people show up in sexy clothes.

41:41.700 --> 41:43.780
Are you, Justin's drooling right now.

41:43.780 --> 41:45.780
Are you just painting erotic fiction

41:45.780 --> 41:46.900
for our listeners right now?

41:46.900 --> 41:47.940
About Santa?

41:47.940 --> 41:49.700
That's ASMR right there.

41:49.700 --> 41:50.420
No, it wasn't.

41:50.420 --> 41:52.980
It was ASMR right, basically.

41:52.980 --> 41:53.480
No.

41:54.180 --> 41:56.420
Have you guys noticed the more we talk about ASMR,

41:56.420 --> 41:58.580
the more defensive people get about ASMR?

41:58.580 --> 42:00.500
And the more demand that there is for it.

42:00.500 --> 42:01.540
For it, yeah.

42:01.540 --> 42:02.180
It's upsetting.

42:02.180 --> 42:03.140
Y'all welcome.

42:03.140 --> 42:04.340
Y'all welcome.

42:04.340 --> 42:05.940
You're throwing stones at a glass house right now

42:05.940 --> 42:07.540
because that's like your jam and you can't find it.

42:07.540 --> 42:09.860
I don't get militant about it though.

42:09.860 --> 42:10.360
Okay.

42:11.940 --> 42:13.220
Oh, you're sad now?

42:13.220 --> 42:16.500
This Christmas, I received the same gifts

42:16.500 --> 42:18.420
from my parents and my boyfriend's parents

42:18.420 --> 42:20.260
after they shopped for my Amazon wish list.

42:20.900 --> 42:22.100
I don't want to upset either of them

42:22.100 --> 42:23.300
by returning the gifts they chose,

42:23.300 --> 42:26.100
but I also don't need two pairs of the same shoes.

42:26.820 --> 42:28.980
Should I let one of them know I'm returning their gift

42:28.980 --> 42:30.740
or should I keep it on the down low

42:30.740 --> 42:31.780
and thank them each for the gifts

42:31.780 --> 42:33.380
for returning one of the duplicates?

42:33.380 --> 42:34.740
That's ruining our returns.

42:34.740 --> 42:36.340
Do you fucking need our-

42:36.340 --> 42:39.140
Like, did you come all the way down to our office for this?

42:39.140 --> 42:40.260
Could I get free money

42:40.260 --> 42:42.180
or should I just put things in garbage can?

42:42.180 --> 42:43.140
What are you saying?

42:43.140 --> 42:44.420
What are you talking about?

42:44.420 --> 42:45.060
I will say-

42:45.060 --> 42:46.660
How did you get past the secretary?

42:46.660 --> 42:48.820
Let me say congratulations

42:49.780 --> 42:53.540
on opening that second present and pulling it off.

42:53.540 --> 42:56.100
Because that's a challenge every year.

42:56.100 --> 42:57.380
You open that second present

42:57.380 --> 43:00.100
and you have that split second rushes through your brain,

43:00.100 --> 43:01.060
like, oh, I got this.

43:01.060 --> 43:01.700
What do I say?

43:01.700 --> 43:02.580
Oh my God, this is so-

43:02.580 --> 43:03.540
I know I'm going to do it.

43:03.540 --> 43:04.100
I'm going to do it.

43:04.100 --> 43:05.380
And then you pull out of that nose dive

43:05.380 --> 43:06.980
and you're like, oh my God, thank you so much.

43:06.980 --> 43:07.300
Thank you.

43:07.300 --> 43:07.780
It's crazy.

43:07.780 --> 43:09.060
Exactly what I wanted.

43:09.060 --> 43:11.620
Two, I say you keep it.

43:12.500 --> 43:12.740
What?

43:12.740 --> 43:13.540
You got to back up.

43:13.540 --> 43:14.660
Have a backup.

43:14.660 --> 43:15.460
Have a back-

43:15.460 --> 43:18.180
My greatest fear at any point in my life

43:18.180 --> 43:20.260
is that one of my wonderful material possessions

43:20.260 --> 43:20.740
will be ruined.

43:20.740 --> 43:23.460
So take one of your many belongings.

43:23.460 --> 43:24.740
And then, and so knowing

43:24.740 --> 43:27.300
that I've got a backup material possession

43:27.300 --> 43:28.900
will put me at ease.

43:28.900 --> 43:29.780
Put me at ease.

43:29.780 --> 43:31.220
And just the having of-

43:31.220 --> 43:32.740
Oh, having things.

43:32.740 --> 43:34.660
Having things is so great.

43:34.660 --> 43:35.700
You've got one whole thing

43:35.700 --> 43:36.980
just to do whatever you want with.

43:40.820 --> 43:42.420
It was about packages.

43:42.420 --> 43:43.700
It was about tags.

43:43.700 --> 43:45.220
Grinch brings your shit back and it's like,

43:45.220 --> 43:46.740
we already bought new shit.

43:46.740 --> 43:48.100
And now we've got two of the shits.

43:48.100 --> 43:49.540
It's a Christmas miracle.

43:49.540 --> 43:51.140
And this has been Travis's Grinch.

43:52.020 --> 43:53.860
We've got so many who bangers.

43:55.620 --> 43:56.740
That's one of the things that-

43:56.740 --> 43:58.020
Yo, what's up party people?

43:58.020 --> 44:00.740
I got another who banger coming at you.

44:00.740 --> 44:01.860
Get on the floor.

44:01.860 --> 44:02.360
Door.

44:02.980 --> 44:04.420
Now pass that who hash.

44:06.660 --> 44:09.060
Put your titties on the roast beast.

44:09.060 --> 44:10.900
Put your titties on the roast beast.

44:10.900 --> 44:15.540
You said that with your mouth.

44:15.540 --> 44:18.500
Don't put your titties on the roast beast.

44:18.500 --> 44:20.020
That's not where they go.

44:20.020 --> 44:20.660
We done?

44:20.660 --> 44:21.140
We done.

44:21.140 --> 44:21.700
We done.

44:22.340 --> 44:24.180
Listen, this has been my brother,

44:24.180 --> 44:24.980
my brother and me,

44:24.980 --> 44:26.580
an advice show for the modern era.

44:26.580 --> 44:28.420
We hope you had a lot of fun listening.

44:28.420 --> 44:29.460
Kind of a truncated one,

44:29.460 --> 44:30.660
but you know, it's the holidays

44:30.660 --> 44:32.180
and you should just count yourself lucky

44:32.180 --> 44:32.660
to get anything at all.

44:32.660 --> 44:33.380
Well, don't say that.

44:33.940 --> 44:34.900
Handle it.

44:34.900 --> 44:36.660
Travis and Teresa are late

44:36.660 --> 44:37.860
for a Christmas appointment.

44:37.860 --> 44:39.380
We're trying to get them out the dope.

44:39.380 --> 44:42.980
Oh, so thank you for hanging in there with this.

44:42.980 --> 44:45.940
We appreciate you listening to the program

44:45.940 --> 44:48.340
and laughing along with us

44:48.340 --> 44:49.300
and learning and growing.

44:49.860 --> 44:52.580
We hope you had a great holiday season.

44:52.580 --> 44:54.900
We thank you to people who,

44:54.900 --> 44:58.820
by the way, bought tickets to see us in LA.

44:58.820 --> 45:01.220
That show is sold out from what I understand.

45:01.860 --> 45:03.220
Believe there are still some tickets

45:03.220 --> 45:04.980
to see us with JJ Go in San Francisco

45:05.540 --> 45:06.580
so you can buy those.

45:06.580 --> 45:08.740
Travis, do you remember the Bitly he created?

45:08.740 --> 45:13.060
It's bit.ly forward slash mbmbamsketchfest.

45:13.060 --> 45:16.500
Okay, so you can find those tickets

45:16.500 --> 45:18.900
and buy those if you want to see us in San Francisco.

45:18.900 --> 45:20.740
And we'll be announcing new live shows

45:20.740 --> 45:22.100
probably within a month or so.

45:24.100 --> 45:27.780
Some folks who came to our live show in Huntington

45:27.780 --> 45:29.780
had actually traveled from areas

45:29.780 --> 45:33.940
that we will be in shortly.

45:33.940 --> 45:34.900
So that was kind of awkward.

45:34.900 --> 45:36.180
So that may be Switzerland.

45:36.180 --> 45:37.540
Yeah, maybe Switzerland, who knows?

45:38.900 --> 45:40.340
But so keep an eye out for that.

45:41.220 --> 45:43.620
If you're not a big social media person or whatever,

45:43.620 --> 45:45.860
just follow us, just us,

45:46.660 --> 45:51.860
and we'll tweet information out

45:51.860 --> 45:57.860
that people can consume and use however they want.

45:57.860 --> 45:59.060
Griffin, do you have any thank yous?

45:59.700 --> 46:01.220
Yeah, I want to thank John Roderick

46:01.220 --> 46:02.740
in the long winters for the use of our theme song,

46:02.740 --> 46:04.980
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

46:04.980 --> 46:07.060
You can find that wherever Fine Music is sold.

46:07.060 --> 46:09.220
Saw a few people tweet pictures

46:09.220 --> 46:11.060
of them getting the vinyl for Christmas,

46:11.060 --> 46:12.260
which is very, very exciting.

46:12.260 --> 46:15.300
I also own that vinyl, and boy, is it waxy.

46:16.660 --> 46:19.940
Oh, I also want to say the podcast that I do

46:19.940 --> 46:21.860
with my friend Andy Bolt, Bunker Buddies,

46:21.860 --> 46:24.420
the comedy survival podcast,

46:24.420 --> 46:26.580
we're doing a live show with Jordan Jesse Goh

46:26.580 --> 46:30.260
at UCB Franklin in Los Angeles on January 6th.

46:31.060 --> 46:32.980
It's at 11 p.m. and tickets are only $5.

46:32.980 --> 46:37.860
If you go to bit.ly forward slash LA Bunker Buddies,

46:37.860 --> 46:38.820
you can get tickets there.

46:38.820 --> 46:39.940
So we hope you come out and see us.

46:39.940 --> 46:41.780
It's our first live show and we're really excited.

46:42.420 --> 46:45.940
Also, listen to other podcasts on the Max Fun Network,

46:45.940 --> 46:48.420
Jordan Jesse Goh, stop podcasting yourself,

46:48.420 --> 46:53.300
Throwing Shade, The Goose Down, Song Exploder, Risk.

46:53.300 --> 46:54.580
There's all kinds of free entertainment.

46:54.580 --> 46:56.580
Let's not forget about Sawbones.

46:56.580 --> 46:57.540
Sawbones.

46:57.540 --> 46:58.660
And The Adventure Zone,

46:58.660 --> 47:00.340
our new Dungeons and Dragons podcast

47:00.340 --> 47:01.860
that we do with our dad.

47:01.860 --> 47:03.540
There's a new episode going up this Thursday

47:03.540 --> 47:04.820
that I'm very excited about.

47:05.620 --> 47:07.860
Both, all three of you guys actually do

47:07.860 --> 47:09.700
some really dope shit in this episode.

47:09.700 --> 47:11.220
This was the episode that marks the point

47:11.220 --> 47:14.100
where we forgot we were doing a comedy silly game

47:14.100 --> 47:15.780
and all three got really into it.

47:15.780 --> 47:16.900
It gets pretty silly.

47:16.900 --> 47:18.740
You guys forget some of the antics we got up to,

47:18.740 --> 47:21.460
but there's also some dope adventure shit in there.

47:21.460 --> 47:23.220
Anyway, that's this Thursday.

47:23.220 --> 47:25.460
Tune in, we're only like three episodes deep.

47:25.460 --> 47:27.620
So it's still, you still have time to get on board.

47:27.620 --> 47:28.020
It's really fun.

47:28.020 --> 47:29.860
Seeing a lot of people say they've never played D&D before,

47:29.860 --> 47:32.980
listen to it, it's got a lot of crossover appeal.

47:32.980 --> 47:34.660
And if you decide to play D&D's result,

47:34.660 --> 47:35.940
please tell Wizards of the Coast

47:35.940 --> 47:38.260
so they'll send us some money.

47:38.260 --> 47:38.900
Yeah, I guess.

47:38.900 --> 47:40.260
Or at least some campaign books.

47:40.260 --> 47:42.020
Or some campaign books or just merch.

47:43.060 --> 47:44.340
You got a noisy baby in there.

47:44.340 --> 47:46.100
I hope that we're not picking up the baby's box.

47:46.100 --> 47:47.380
Baby's singing.

47:47.380 --> 47:48.980
Yeah, baby's just spreading the word.

47:49.780 --> 47:50.260
So that's gonna do it for us.

47:50.260 --> 47:51.940
She's the young Ellen Thicke.

47:51.940 --> 47:54.900
Thank you so much for listening to the program.

47:55.860 --> 47:58.500
We hope you've had fun and we're going to miss you.

47:58.500 --> 48:00.660
We hope you have a great, this is the last time.

48:00.660 --> 48:01.940
20, we gotta figure it out.

48:01.940 --> 48:06.900
This is the last time we're gonna talk to you in 2013.

48:06.900 --> 48:07.940
Or no, 20.

48:09.300 --> 48:10.420
Oh my god, what was our shit?

48:10.420 --> 48:11.700
What was 2014?

48:12.900 --> 48:13.380
Oh no.

48:13.940 --> 48:14.500
What was it?

48:14.500 --> 48:16.420
I mean, whatever it was, we didn't fulfill it.

48:16.420 --> 48:18.660
Let's be honest and just say it was 2014.

48:18.660 --> 48:19.620
20 forward.

48:19.620 --> 48:20.660
20 forward.

48:20.660 --> 48:21.540
2014.

48:21.540 --> 48:23.380
It was 2014 though, if we're being honest.

48:23.380 --> 48:25.700
I watched a bore video that somebody made

48:25.700 --> 48:28.020
of a big fox lady swallowing him up.

48:28.020 --> 48:29.860
And it was spliced in with,

48:29.860 --> 48:32.580
brace yourselves, colonoscopy videos.

48:32.580 --> 48:34.020
Or perhaps an endoscopy.

48:34.020 --> 48:35.460
Daddy didn't like that.

48:35.460 --> 48:37.620
Daddy did not like, suddenly the subject of war

48:37.620 --> 48:40.100
became much less funny overnight.

48:40.820 --> 48:41.300
Just like that.

48:41.300 --> 48:44.020
So we have votes from listeners.

48:44.020 --> 48:45.220
Not that they get to vote.

48:45.220 --> 48:45.940
For 2015?

48:46.580 --> 48:48.340
What we're hearing right now,

48:48.340 --> 48:52.900
here are the teen choices in order.

48:52.900 --> 48:54.740
Jim Carrey again wins.

48:54.740 --> 48:57.540
From the bottom up, 2015.

48:57.540 --> 48:58.580
What's that mean?

48:58.580 --> 49:00.260
Seriously, does anybody else smell that?

49:00.260 --> 49:01.300
20 mifteen.

49:02.100 --> 49:03.140
20 swifteen.

49:04.020 --> 49:05.300
20 shifteen.

49:05.300 --> 49:06.500
20 blissteen.

49:07.060 --> 49:08.180
20 milfteen.

49:08.180 --> 49:09.460
Never stop getting it.

49:09.460 --> 49:10.420
20 lifteen.

49:10.420 --> 49:11.940
Raise someone's spirits.

49:11.940 --> 49:13.220
20 whatifteen.

49:13.220 --> 49:14.340
Imagine the possibilities.

49:16.980 --> 49:18.260
20 gifteen.

49:18.260 --> 49:19.300
Share the wealth.

49:19.300 --> 49:20.580
20 splifteen.

49:20.580 --> 49:22.180
Oh my god, I forgot about 20 splifteen.

49:22.180 --> 49:23.300
I'm gonna 420 so hard next year.

49:23.300 --> 49:25.300
20 thrifteen.

49:25.300 --> 49:26.500
And the number one.

49:26.500 --> 49:28.420
And what I think should be the official.

49:28.420 --> 49:28.980
Grifteen.

49:28.980 --> 49:29.780
20 grifteen.

49:29.780 --> 49:30.660
The con is on.

49:31.780 --> 49:32.900
20 grifteen.

49:32.900 --> 49:35.220
The con is on all year long.

49:35.220 --> 49:37.620
So wait, we need to fucking get out the blueprints right now

49:37.620 --> 49:39.380
and start planning this heist.

49:39.380 --> 49:42.340
This is the con is on next year in 20 grifteen.

49:42.340 --> 49:43.860
So we hope to see you there.

49:43.860 --> 49:46.900
Thank you for being with us through 20 forward slash 2014.

49:47.780 --> 49:48.820
Sorry we didn't do it.

49:48.820 --> 49:49.700
Sorry that we didn't.

49:49.700 --> 49:50.340
I don't know.

49:50.340 --> 49:53.540
I feel like we moved forward significantly.

49:53.540 --> 49:54.340
We moved the change.

49:54.340 --> 49:55.140
Griffin one last time.

49:55.140 --> 49:56.740
I swallowed lots of men.

49:58.100 --> 49:58.980
So it's a tie, really.

49:58.980 --> 49:59.460
It's a toss up.

49:59.460 --> 50:00.020
Griffin.

50:00.020 --> 50:03.540
This final Yahoo was sent in by, how appropriate, Drew Davenport.

50:03.540 --> 50:05.380
The beginning and the end.

50:05.380 --> 50:06.420
Thank you, Drew Davenport.

50:06.420 --> 50:11.460
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ross who asks, oh, I navigated away from the page.

50:11.460 --> 50:16.180
Ross asks, how hard can you twerk without dying?

50:17.300 --> 50:18.340
I'm Justin McElroy.
