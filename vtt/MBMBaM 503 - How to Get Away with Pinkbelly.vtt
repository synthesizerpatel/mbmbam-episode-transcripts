00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.840 --> 00:47.680
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show from the modern

00:47.680 --> 00:51.440
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:51.440 --> 00:54.720
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin Andrew McElroy.

00:54.720 --> 01:01.040
Guys, what's still funny? Very little, it seems.

01:01.040 --> 01:05.600
What's still funny is the thing for me. You know what, Justin? I don't know about

01:05.600 --> 01:10.240
funny. I don't know from funny anymore. What's still funny? We're supposed to punch

01:10.240 --> 01:14.480
up, not down. Everybody's down. Yeah, we can punch side to side.

01:14.480 --> 01:17.440
I can punch you, and you can punch Griffin. Let's try punching each other.

01:17.440 --> 01:24.160
Lateral punches. Let's give that a shot. Okay, let me go. Travis, the noise of you

01:24.160 --> 01:29.280
eating peanut M&Ms when we began was profane. But I did it off mic, Justin.

01:29.280 --> 01:32.000
No, you didn't, bud, because I just told you what you were eating.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.840
No, sorry, sorry. I did it off audience mic. The audience didn't have to. Just you.

01:37.840 --> 01:41.040
Just you, my brother. Yeah, but I got it.

01:41.040 --> 01:43.760
I don't like this. I don't like us punching side to side.

01:43.760 --> 01:46.720
No punching sideways. Travis, did you send questions?

01:46.720 --> 01:52.240
We going to do those, or it feels... Maybe not questions this time. I don't know.

01:52.240 --> 01:54.640
Questions feels... Okay, let's talk about... Listen,

01:55.280 --> 01:59.920
this is negative for everyone. Let's acknowledge something up front.

01:59.920 --> 02:04.720
This situation is negative for everyone to different degrees.

02:04.720 --> 02:07.280
Yes. This is not news to us.

02:07.280 --> 02:17.360
We are going to push forward in the best way that we can sort of manage in our sort of twisted...

02:17.360 --> 02:25.040
Let's shut up. First of all, can you guys fucking wait for the South Park episode about this?

02:25.040 --> 02:29.600
Holy shit, guys. I said that fucking phrase out loud.

02:29.600 --> 02:32.560
Oh, no. But I don't think they're in production.

02:32.560 --> 02:36.560
I think everybody stopped production. See, you can't even get like a little twist

02:36.560 --> 02:42.560
of South Park humor joke going right now. Hey, can I tell you guys something real

02:42.560 --> 02:44.240
from the heart? Yeah, sure.

02:44.240 --> 02:46.080
I guess. I had a lot of funny stuff to say

02:46.080 --> 02:47.680
about South Park, but go ahead, Travis. I know.

02:47.680 --> 02:52.640
I'm so happy to be talking to you two boys. Oh, God, I know.

02:52.640 --> 02:58.480
Because if I'm being honest, even though I spent time with my family,

02:58.480 --> 03:02.960
I have spent a little too much time with myself. Oh, I see.

03:02.960 --> 03:09.520
Yeah, last night, I found the entire season of Boy Meets World on Disney+.

03:09.520 --> 03:14.160
So I was watching some episodes of that, which led me to thinking about the Lawrence Brothers,

03:14.160 --> 03:18.560
which, and this is not an exaggeration for the podcast, I became very worried about the

03:18.560 --> 03:20.960
Lawrence Brothers. I hadn't heard from them in a while.

03:20.960 --> 03:26.320
And I found myself having real emotional investment in making sure that the Lawrence

03:26.320 --> 03:31.200
Brothers are doing okay. In the context of the global pandemic?

03:31.200 --> 03:37.120
Okay, so you're just saying you're worried about early 2019 Lawrence Brothers.

03:37.120 --> 03:41.120
Yeah, I'm just saying I've kept up with most brothers in the game.

03:41.680 --> 03:45.760
I know what's going on, but we get the newsletters. Right, but the Lawrence Brothers,

03:45.760 --> 03:50.800
I realized it's been a solid grip since I heard anything about those fools.

03:50.800 --> 03:53.040
And I was worried about them, but they're Wikipedias.

03:53.040 --> 03:55.520
It seems like everything's okay. Good, good, good.

03:55.520 --> 03:58.320
I think that's the secret, right? We're all anxious people.

03:58.320 --> 04:01.680
And when I say all, I mean literally every person listening to this.

04:01.680 --> 04:06.240
And if you are listening to this and you don't have anxiety, what are you doing, man?

04:06.240 --> 04:10.080
Yeah, give me a snoot of that. Yeah, let me have a huff of whatever

04:10.080 --> 04:12.720
you're huffing, pal, because I would love to ride that Bronco.

04:13.520 --> 04:20.480
But, you know, it's maybe you can occupy your anxiety with something completely demented,

04:20.480 --> 04:23.920
like what are the Lawrence Brothers up to? And then you can-

04:23.920 --> 04:27.200
Griffin, let me be clear, not what are they up to? Are they okay?

04:27.200 --> 04:28.720
Are they okay? Are they good?

04:28.720 --> 04:30.400
Are they doing well? Are they-

04:30.400 --> 04:34.400
Here's the thing, it's three child actors in that family,

04:34.400 --> 04:37.360
and all three of them seem to be doing okay, statistically.

04:37.360 --> 04:40.000
But they're in cloaking mode. Yes.

04:40.560 --> 04:47.440
Here is one bad thing, is I will tell you guys up front,

04:48.000 --> 04:50.480
I wanted to come hot with a fun segment.

04:51.200 --> 04:55.120
Not a lot of innovation in the fast food space right now.

04:55.120 --> 04:59.440
Shoot, Juice. That innovation has ground to a halt.

04:59.440 --> 05:03.360
And I know what you're thinking, it seemed to have been all upside so far

05:03.360 --> 05:08.160
with this unpleasantness, but now there's a downside as well.

05:08.160 --> 05:15.040
And it is fast food innovation has ground to a halt.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.520
When we needed them most. I know.

05:17.520 --> 05:21.200
Here's a new innovation, if any of the fast food industry is listening.

05:21.760 --> 05:23.520
Yeah. What if it was-

05:23.520 --> 05:25.680
And what excuse do they have? Yeah, right?

05:26.480 --> 05:32.640
What if it was like food, but I went to the store and bought it,

05:32.640 --> 05:35.760
and then I could make it at home, so no other human hands ever touched it?

05:37.360 --> 05:40.480
That's them's groceries. That's groceries.

05:40.480 --> 05:41.840
Yeah, you made groceries. You know what?

05:41.840 --> 05:45.680
I knew it as soon as I said it, I was like, yeah, you're right.

05:45.680 --> 05:49.040
Okay, what about this? A bigger drive-through window,

05:49.040 --> 05:52.800
so like eight people can be getting food all at once.

05:53.840 --> 05:56.720
We're veering towards food train, Trav.

05:56.720 --> 05:59.040
So yeah, we've also covered food train.

05:59.680 --> 06:03.280
Okay, food train, if you are not aware of the deep lore,

06:04.080 --> 06:08.320
food train is an innovation where all the world's food would be art.

06:08.320 --> 06:11.040
No, sorry, all the nation's food would be on a single train

06:11.680 --> 06:13.920
that would be like a roving food truck

06:13.920 --> 06:17.840
that could move along and expand or attract capacity as needed.

06:17.840 --> 06:18.480
Yeah, right.

06:18.480 --> 06:22.480
And crucially, it was staffed by sexy robots.

06:22.480 --> 06:25.600
Yeah, because the full surface was so hot.

06:25.600 --> 06:30.800
Yeah, whose bodies were grills, and they all look like Mark Ruffalo.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.640
I've watched this bit recently.

06:32.640 --> 06:33.920
I forgot that part.

06:33.920 --> 06:37.040
The sexy Ruffalo bots and everybody wanted to get on the train

06:37.040 --> 06:38.720
because it looks so sexy and hot.

06:39.360 --> 06:44.240
Would we be, as a nation, in a better or worse scenario

06:44.240 --> 06:48.320
if the nation had heeded our warnings about food train

06:48.320 --> 06:51.440
some three years ago or however long ago it was

06:51.440 --> 06:53.520
when we sort of breathed that into existence?

06:54.320 --> 06:55.920
I think one would fix the other.

06:57.280 --> 06:58.400
I think one would fix the other.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.480
Which one would fix the other one, Griffin?

07:00.480 --> 07:00.800
Yep.

07:02.240 --> 07:05.200
Oh, like Seabiscuit fixed all of us, that kind of thing.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.680
But also how we kind of fix Seabiscuit, if you think about it.

07:07.680 --> 07:08.800
Thank you, we did.

07:08.800 --> 07:09.520
We did fix Seabiscuit.

07:09.520 --> 07:10.800
Because we made a movie about him,

07:10.800 --> 07:12.640
and without that, he's just another horse.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.560
Hey, do you guys think we could get a bunch of podcasters

07:14.560 --> 07:16.720
together and make a viral video of us all singing

07:16.720 --> 07:18.640
like Wild Honey Pie or...

07:18.640 --> 07:23.120
Actually, I think we, Griffin, I hate to sort of tone police you,

07:23.920 --> 07:26.480
I think we're switching back to popular.

07:26.480 --> 07:30.800
I think we're gonna stop calling videos and stuff viral,

07:30.800 --> 07:32.800
and I think we're just gonna start calling that popular again.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.000
Oh, that's good, I like that.

07:34.000 --> 07:34.880
I like that a lot.

07:34.880 --> 07:38.480
But we could do like, we could get fucking Joe Rogan

07:38.480 --> 07:44.080
and do like Dizzy Miss Lizzy or like Eleanor Rigby or something.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.440
That's so close-minded.

07:45.440 --> 07:49.520
What about Sex and Candy by Marcy's Playground?

07:49.520 --> 07:53.280
That could be super strong, and I would think that, Trav,

07:53.920 --> 07:56.640
we would make that video, Travis?

07:56.640 --> 07:57.040
Yeah.

07:57.040 --> 08:01.200
And I think it would do something out there.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.320
Well, because here's what I'll say,

08:02.320 --> 08:05.840
here's what I see an opportunity for, baby boom, right?

08:05.840 --> 08:08.560
Everybody was talking before this, there's not enough babies.

08:08.560 --> 08:09.120
Everyone agreed.

08:09.120 --> 08:13.440
I have not been particularly horny the past month or so, Trav.

08:13.440 --> 08:14.560
Well, that's what I'm saying.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.600
We're all locked up, but we don't have the hornet.

08:17.600 --> 08:21.280
What if we do Sex and Candy and everyone's like, oh shit.

08:21.280 --> 08:23.600
Oh, actually, yeah, let's reproduce.

08:23.600 --> 08:24.160
Yeah, right?

08:24.160 --> 08:26.640
They hear that, as everyone can agree,

08:26.640 --> 08:31.200
Sex and Candy by Marcy's Playground is the sexiest song on Earth

08:31.200 --> 08:33.280
because it's about the two things people like most.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.280
Right there on the 10, right there on the 10.

08:35.280 --> 08:36.960
And so you hear Sex and Candy and you're like,

08:36.960 --> 08:38.400
well, I really don't feel like it,

08:38.400 --> 08:40.960
and I think we were supposed to socially distance each other,

08:40.960 --> 08:42.240
even in our own homes.

08:42.240 --> 08:44.400
I'm not certain about that part, but-

08:44.400 --> 08:46.720
I tried to convince my kids that that was the case.

08:46.720 --> 08:48.080
They just weren't buying it.

08:48.080 --> 08:48.320
Yeah.

08:49.120 --> 08:51.280
So let's get Robert Kralwich on the phone,

08:51.840 --> 08:54.320
and we'll get him to drop a verse of Sex and Candy.

08:54.320 --> 08:55.120
Justin, do you know him?

08:55.120 --> 08:56.080
Or just the whole thing.

08:56.640 --> 08:59.440
Get Robert Kralwich, yeah, that'll be our Imagine video.

08:59.440 --> 09:05.280
It's just Robert Kralwich singing all of Sex and Candy front to back.

09:05.280 --> 09:05.520
Yep.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.680
Can I tell you guys the traveling thing

09:09.680 --> 09:12.080
about some of these ideas that we tend to throw out there?

09:12.080 --> 09:13.040
They're getting you too horny.

09:13.760 --> 09:18.720
No, it's that I now have this bad part of my brain that's like,

09:18.720 --> 09:20.240
what the fuck else are they doing?

09:20.240 --> 09:21.760
You know, like we could get-

09:21.760 --> 09:25.520
I've been thinking like, is this the moment that we should try

09:25.520 --> 09:28.720
to get like bag some big celebs?

09:28.720 --> 09:28.960
Yeah.

09:28.960 --> 09:29.520
Like, yeah.

09:29.520 --> 09:34.320
You know, business as usual for us, I mean, except if I can find the time

09:34.320 --> 09:35.840
to keep coming down here and doing this.

09:36.720 --> 09:43.040
But like, I know a lot of Hollywood and TV are sort of in suspension right now.

09:43.040 --> 09:48.560
We had a couple of projects kind of thrown into disarray by this.

09:48.560 --> 09:54.400
So we are speaking from a reasonably educated stance here.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.240
Should we try to bag some big ones?

09:56.240 --> 09:58.720
I think we could get a Richard Gere.

09:59.280 --> 10:05.280
Like that feels like a reach for not just like scale wise,

10:05.280 --> 10:07.680
but also just like demographic wise.

10:07.680 --> 10:10.640
I feel like a Richard Gere is out of our reach in many ways,

10:11.200 --> 10:13.600
but maybe a Richard Gere type.

10:13.600 --> 10:16.000
I'm not even saying necessarily Richard Gere.

10:17.520 --> 10:17.840
We could-

10:17.840 --> 10:19.280
No, Richard Gere's good, Trav.

10:19.280 --> 10:20.400
Let's talk about that for a second.

10:20.400 --> 10:23.760
Because what I like about that is extremely difficult to attain.

10:23.760 --> 10:28.640
And I think also my best guess would be a very bad match for the energy of this program.

10:29.280 --> 10:33.200
Between those two, I think that's an interesting submission.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.080
Griffin, who do you have?

10:34.080 --> 10:36.560
Can we get a- No, it's Richard Gere, Justin.

10:36.560 --> 10:39.440
Because we're going to give Richard Gere podcast glow up, baby.

10:39.440 --> 10:39.920
Yes!

10:39.920 --> 10:45.360
We're going to turn this motherfucker into a real popular sensation on the internet.

10:45.360 --> 10:47.120
It's really hard to not say that word.

10:47.120 --> 10:50.720
And I think that we can make him good at Fortnite.

10:50.720 --> 10:54.000
I think that we can make him talk about TikTok.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.080
I think we can make him whip a Nae Nae.

10:56.720 --> 10:57.920
What up, GearHeads?

10:57.920 --> 10:59.120
It's me, Richie Boy.

10:59.760 --> 11:00.560
Coming at you live.

11:00.560 --> 11:01.840
Be sure to smash that like and subscribe button.

11:01.840 --> 11:02.720
GearHeads is good.

11:02.720 --> 11:03.600
Smash that.

11:03.600 --> 11:04.400
Smash them.

11:04.400 --> 11:07.520
And I'm going to open up a box of small toys.

11:08.160 --> 11:09.520
And this one's for kids.

11:09.520 --> 11:10.240
I'm Richard Gere.

11:10.240 --> 11:10.960
What's in this box?

11:10.960 --> 11:14.400
It's going to have some marbles and hard candies in there.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.320
Hey kids, smash the like, bud.

11:16.320 --> 11:21.840
I just got legitimately excited to watch Richard Gere open some blind bags

11:21.840 --> 11:23.840
with complete enthusiasm.

11:23.840 --> 11:28.960
Yeah, I got the new LOLs, glow ups, season three, rip them open.

11:28.960 --> 11:30.960
This is advertorial content.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.400
Just got to get that out there.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.600
And remember guys, if you're not sleeping on Casper, you're not really sleeping.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.520
Okay, so let's open these bags.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.440
This is how we're going to whip this thing's ass.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.360
Is not saying what can Richard Gere do for us?

11:44.240 --> 11:44.640
Yes.

11:44.640 --> 11:46.640
But what can we do for Richard Gere?

11:47.200 --> 11:47.840
Yes, yes.

11:47.840 --> 11:54.240
And by Richard Gere, sometimes I also mean other people who actually need help in the world.

11:54.240 --> 11:54.560
Well, sure.

11:54.560 --> 11:58.960
Right now, hypothetically, we're going to start with making Richard Gere a top tier YouTuber.

12:00.240 --> 12:06.160
And if I could just sort of do, maybe I get in touch with Ninja and I say,

12:06.160 --> 12:08.480
Ninja, can Richard Gere be you for a day?

12:09.920 --> 12:10.960
Yeah, that would be good.

12:10.960 --> 12:17.120
And Ninja gets to live, trading spaces with Richard Gere and Ninja would be good.

12:17.120 --> 12:18.800
Richard Gere has to go on and try.

12:18.800 --> 12:25.760
If you just try to log on to Ninja's computer, if you can figure out how to start on Twitch,

12:28.240 --> 12:33.600
you can phone three 13 year olds that you know and they can try to help you.

12:34.160 --> 12:36.480
See, and he's going to fucking get it.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.360
No, we're releasing this on Monday.

12:39.360 --> 12:40.160
We're probably fine.

12:40.160 --> 12:40.720
Fine.

12:40.720 --> 12:46.480
Listen, I've seen some of our celebrities already.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.600
Listen, everybody's saying, imagine that was great.

12:49.600 --> 12:50.240
We were-

12:50.240 --> 12:50.800
We love that.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.560
Not asked to get in on that.

12:52.560 --> 12:58.400
I got to give a shout out to my man, Sam Neal, who we have talked about during the Celebrity Wine,

12:58.400 --> 12:59.280
Why Not segment.

13:00.160 --> 13:04.880
Sam Neal put out a video of himself and this is the entirety of the video.

13:04.880 --> 13:07.520
Sam Neal says, hey, I'm doing okay.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.120
Of course, he looks fucking great.

13:09.120 --> 13:09.440
Yeah.

13:09.440 --> 13:10.640
So sexy.

13:10.640 --> 13:15.200
Out on his like vineyard, wherever, hold up like, well, I'm in isolation.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.160
He's like, I don't know.

13:16.160 --> 13:17.520
I didn't know what to do with myself.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.360
So I washed all my shoes.

13:19.360 --> 13:21.440
And then he shows a shot of all his clean shoes.

13:21.440 --> 13:23.680
He's like, but I don't have anywhere to wear them.

13:23.680 --> 13:26.960
But man, and then he picks one up and just gets a snoot fall.

13:26.960 --> 13:29.280
He's like, man, do they smell good?

13:29.840 --> 13:32.240
Anyway, hope your family is doing well.

13:33.440 --> 13:36.160
Sam Neal, that's the best you got.

13:36.160 --> 13:38.000
This is amazing because it's-

13:38.000 --> 13:41.760
Man, you've been in isolation for four days and you're already washing your shoes?

13:41.760 --> 13:43.280
It sets a bar for us, doesn't it?

13:43.280 --> 13:45.040
Because I don't know the decorum.

13:45.040 --> 13:48.080
I would love to make the world fucking laugh and share a Pepsi,

13:48.080 --> 13:51.120
but I also don't want to be, you know, unrespectful.

13:51.680 --> 13:58.800
But now I have a bottom, a baseline of like what I can put out into the world.

13:58.800 --> 14:03.840
And it's me in my own vineyard, huffing my clean, expensive shoes.

14:04.560 --> 14:06.240
That's the bottom of it.

14:06.240 --> 14:07.840
Top of it is the imagine video.

14:07.840 --> 14:11.040
Now I want to put out a video that's like me in my vineyard.

14:11.040 --> 14:14.880
And I'm like, I'm in isolation and I didn't know what to do.

14:14.880 --> 14:19.440
So I just did a bunch of research on the Lawrence brothers to make sure they were okay.

14:19.440 --> 14:23.120
And then I just like huffed some pictures of the Lawrence brothers.

14:23.120 --> 14:25.440
Like maybe I've printed out their Wikipedia.

14:25.440 --> 14:28.240
And I say, man, this Wikipedia smells great.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.160
And then I just eat the pages.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.360
That's good too.

14:31.360 --> 14:35.360
Or we could have Richard Gere and Sam Neal have a grape fight in his vineyard.

14:35.360 --> 14:36.720
But from six feet away.

14:36.720 --> 14:37.600
From six feet away.

14:37.600 --> 14:38.160
You got to.

14:38.800 --> 14:42.960
Should we do a question just to get our sea legs under us?

14:42.960 --> 14:45.360
I want to say one other thing.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.000
Slightly more seriously, but it's on my heart.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.880
And I don't know how to like process this otherwise.

14:51.520 --> 14:58.960
We have gone at, for the past, like let's call it nine and a half years.

14:58.960 --> 15:02.240
We've tried, cause we've been doing the show for 10 almost.

15:02.240 --> 15:04.160
Gonna be a big anniversary soon.

15:04.160 --> 15:06.400
But we've been doing the show for a while.

15:06.400 --> 15:10.400
And for the bulk of it and like most of our professional careers,

15:10.400 --> 15:16.320
we've made it our goal, like try to have fun without hurting people

15:16.320 --> 15:19.840
and trying not to like make things worse or make people feel bad really

15:19.840 --> 15:20.880
is what I should say.

15:21.600 --> 15:26.400
But I feel like everyone is in the same boat in a sense,

15:26.400 --> 15:29.520
which should be like easier to make that easier.

15:29.520 --> 15:30.960
But everybody's in very different boats

15:30.960 --> 15:33.120
because it's going to impact everybody differently.

15:33.120 --> 15:37.040
So we're just trying, we're going to try.

15:37.040 --> 15:37.600
I don't know.

15:37.600 --> 15:38.800
It's a tough time.

15:38.800 --> 15:42.800
I'm obviously like, again, I have to put this like corollary and everything,

15:42.800 --> 15:45.600
but like it's harder for a lot of people.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.120
It's easier for some people, I'm sure.

15:50.240 --> 15:53.040
So we're trying, we're going to try our best

15:53.040 --> 15:54.480
and it'll be a learning process.

15:56.480 --> 15:59.040
But like, we're not going to stop.

15:59.680 --> 16:01.200
We can't stop.

16:01.200 --> 16:01.680
No, we could.

16:01.680 --> 16:02.560
We could.

16:02.560 --> 16:06.160
I mean, yeah, but they canceled all our dang tours.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.400
So we do have to keep the lights on.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.800
To be fair, I've got nothing else to do.

16:10.800 --> 16:11.840
Nothing else to do.

16:13.760 --> 16:17.440
So please, you know, hang in there with us

16:17.440 --> 16:18.640
and we will hang in there with you

16:18.640 --> 16:21.200
and we'll get through this thing together

16:22.320 --> 16:26.320
and it will continue to be like the show,

16:26.320 --> 16:28.640
but it'll be different because everything's different now.

16:28.640 --> 16:32.240
But we're still here to provide an oasis for you

16:33.440 --> 16:34.800
in as much as we can.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.320
Drink our cool waters.

16:36.320 --> 16:37.680
Drink these calm, cool waters.

16:37.680 --> 16:40.000
Drink a sip of these calm, cool waters

16:40.720 --> 16:44.080
and we're going to do our best to make this fun for everybody.

16:44.640 --> 16:46.960
Obviously, if you're already struggling,

16:46.960 --> 16:49.680
I know a lot of people, especially in like service industries

16:49.680 --> 16:53.600
and restaurants, bars, et cetera,

16:53.600 --> 16:57.120
that are already like in pain and we love you

16:57.120 --> 17:01.440
and hang in there.

17:01.440 --> 17:02.960
Justin, that was very nice.

17:03.680 --> 17:04.720
Thanks, Travis.

17:04.720 --> 17:07.120
You like didn't, you barely even let me finish

17:07.120 --> 17:07.680
before you said that.

17:07.680 --> 17:09.120
So I feel like you had that queued up.

17:09.120 --> 17:10.080
No, it's just so exciting.

17:10.080 --> 17:11.200
I really didn't mean it.

17:11.200 --> 17:13.360
I thought it could have been better.

17:13.360 --> 17:14.240
Oh, well.

17:14.240 --> 17:14.640
Wow.

17:14.640 --> 17:16.560
Okay, well, you can punch it up in editing.

17:16.560 --> 17:18.000
Maybe add some strings.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.520
Sure, let me add like some like.

17:24.400 --> 17:24.960
Oh, let me.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.200
Woo, go Justin.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.800
Woo, slam dunk.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.480
Griffin, you can edit this in wherever.

17:30.480 --> 17:31.440
Okay, and I'll drop that in.

17:33.280 --> 17:34.320
And let me do this one.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.120
You the man.

17:35.680 --> 17:36.640
That was good.

17:36.640 --> 17:37.760
My son's gonna wake up from his nap.

17:37.760 --> 17:40.560
Travis, I have to ask you about these questions real quick.

17:41.600 --> 17:47.600
What epoch of human civilization are they from, would you say?

17:48.320 --> 17:49.760
They're from the before time.

17:50.720 --> 17:51.920
Okay, well, that'll be fun.

17:51.920 --> 17:54.000
We have a limited supply of these bad boys.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.280
Yeah, this is from all the way back March 16th.

17:58.080 --> 18:01.440
Oh, I'm looking at currently.

18:01.440 --> 18:02.800
Oh, and they're all titled,

18:02.800 --> 18:04.480
roommate keeps drinking their own pee?

18:04.480 --> 18:05.840
Question mark, question mark, question mark.

18:05.840 --> 18:07.680
So this is like 1700 of those.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.280
So that'll be a hot topic.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.280
I actually have a question here, can't, may I?

18:12.160 --> 18:12.480
No.

18:12.480 --> 18:14.000
Rittle me piss, boys.

18:14.000 --> 18:14.960
Oh my God.

18:16.160 --> 18:17.440
I'd rather drink my own pee.

18:17.440 --> 18:20.480
It's the thing that's gonna get us out of this funk.

18:20.480 --> 18:21.920
Rittle me piss, Justin.

18:21.920 --> 18:23.840
I would argue that the thing that's gonna get us out of the funk

18:23.840 --> 18:28.720
is doing the thing that you usually do.

18:28.720 --> 18:29.440
But this is good.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.280
Actually, I would rather do this now, Juice,

18:32.240 --> 18:33.440
where it's at the beginning,

18:33.440 --> 18:34.800
and then we can recover from it

18:34.800 --> 18:37.200
instead of having it hit us in the middle

18:37.200 --> 18:38.160
and knock us off balance.

18:38.720 --> 18:39.760
Give me a feast,

18:39.760 --> 18:43.360
give me something I can really sink my fucking teeth into, Trav.

18:43.360 --> 18:46.400
This one I find, I think it's revolutionary.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.040
Are you ready?

18:47.040 --> 18:48.240
Let me make a meal of it.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.320
There are three ants.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.800
The first one is at the front.

18:52.800 --> 18:56.560
Second one in the middle and third one at the back.

18:57.600 --> 19:00.720
The front one says that behind me there are five ants.

19:01.120 --> 19:04.160
The middle one says that behind me there are three ants.

19:04.560 --> 19:07.360
And the back one says that there are eight ants in front of me.

19:07.360 --> 19:08.480
How can this be?

19:10.080 --> 19:11.920
Holy shit, Travis.

19:11.920 --> 19:15.680
I cannot even visualize what you are saying.

19:15.680 --> 19:17.040
Do you need me to read it again, Justin?

19:17.040 --> 19:19.280
I mean, I know the version of this riddle

19:19.280 --> 19:24.800
where the numbers aren't just fucking number pasta

19:24.800 --> 19:27.920
just kind of thrown in a bowl and stirred all around.

19:27.920 --> 19:32.320
This one was sent to us by Michael.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.200
Do you need to hear it again?

19:35.200 --> 19:36.880
No, I mean, they're walking in a circle,

19:36.880 --> 19:38.720
but why are there more ants?

19:39.360 --> 19:41.520
Well, the one in front says behind me there are five.

19:41.520 --> 19:43.200
The middle one says behind me there are three.

19:43.840 --> 19:46.000
And the back one says in front of me there are eight.

19:46.000 --> 19:46.800
Did you guys give up?

19:46.800 --> 19:49.120
Oh, they're walking in front of a mirror.

19:50.160 --> 19:50.800
And it's a circle.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.560
They're a circle walking in front of a mirror.

19:53.120 --> 19:53.680
Good guess.

19:53.680 --> 19:54.320
Good guess.

19:54.320 --> 19:55.360
Justin, any guesses?

19:56.000 --> 19:57.760
No, Travis, I don't have any guesses.

19:57.760 --> 19:59.520
Well, the answer is simple.

20:00.160 --> 20:02.240
They are all liars.

20:02.240 --> 20:02.480
Okay.

20:03.360 --> 20:04.320
You can't.

20:04.320 --> 20:05.520
You can't do that.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.880
This is why I love this because this is revolutionary

20:08.880 --> 20:10.160
because this could be like, you know,

20:10.160 --> 20:13.200
a father and son are in a plane crash

20:13.200 --> 20:16.240
and the father dies and the son is rushed to the hospital

20:16.240 --> 20:18.080
but when he gets there, the doctor says,

20:18.080 --> 20:20.800
I can't operate on this child because he's my son.

20:20.800 --> 20:21.520
How can this be?

20:22.080 --> 20:23.600
Answer, he's lying.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.040
We could just have all kinds of questions like this.

20:27.040 --> 20:28.880
What can you put in a barrel to make it lighter?

20:28.880 --> 20:30.240
A fucking lie.

20:30.240 --> 20:30.720
A lie.

20:31.520 --> 20:34.000
What's red and white and green all over?

20:34.000 --> 20:34.560
Nothing.

20:34.560 --> 20:35.680
I lied.

20:35.680 --> 20:37.200
Travis has lied to you.

20:39.680 --> 20:40.560
Okay, here's a question.

20:41.680 --> 20:43.840
My friend is getting a vasectomy soon

20:43.840 --> 20:46.560
and the doctor said he could choose any music he likes.

20:46.560 --> 20:48.720
The doctor warned he would likely associate this music

20:48.720 --> 20:50.240
with the procedure forever afterwards.

20:50.800 --> 20:51.920
Any recommendations?

20:51.920 --> 20:53.040
That's from Sniptoon.

20:54.960 --> 20:56.720
I can only imagine.

20:57.760 --> 20:58.800
Is that one?

20:58.800 --> 20:59.360
Is that anything?

20:59.360 --> 21:04.240
Well, Justin, it seemed like you were coming at this

21:04.240 --> 21:07.280
from the position of let's put a stinker song in there

21:07.280 --> 21:10.640
that you're not gonna be sort of like poisoned by.

21:10.640 --> 21:11.600
You know what I mean?

21:11.600 --> 21:13.120
I can only imagine.

21:13.120 --> 21:18.320
But Justin, you seem to quite enjoy your set.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.240
Yeah, that's what I was trying to capture

21:20.240 --> 21:22.480
was the sort of spirit of rejoicing.

21:22.480 --> 21:23.040
Oh, I see.

21:23.040 --> 21:25.040
A hymn of sorts.

21:26.640 --> 21:29.200
I wish I had had this option because my vasectomy,

21:29.200 --> 21:33.920
the doctors just talked about a bunch of garbage,

21:34.640 --> 21:35.840
a bunch of nonsense.

21:35.840 --> 21:36.560
Do you remember?

21:36.560 --> 21:37.360
Remember any of it?

21:38.080 --> 21:40.160
It was in a sort of Twilight state.

21:40.160 --> 21:42.560
Wait, they gave you Twilight sleep?

21:44.720 --> 21:46.240
We did an episode right after I did it.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.840
I'm sure there's like more details there,

21:47.840 --> 21:49.360
but my brain has not held on to them.

21:49.360 --> 21:51.680
I should go back and listen to it.

21:53.040 --> 21:55.120
Is it just one song long?

21:55.120 --> 21:56.960
It seemed much longer than that.

21:57.680 --> 21:58.400
They're really...

22:00.240 --> 22:01.600
What linked this song?

22:01.600 --> 22:03.840
Is this like an American Pie sort of deal?

22:03.840 --> 22:05.280
Or is it more of a...

22:06.880 --> 22:08.640
I'm gonna do In a God of DeVita, please.

22:08.640 --> 22:13.200
Yeah, because I really want you to take your time down there, yes.

22:13.200 --> 22:16.160
Justin, I'm assuming one of the things that the doctor said

22:16.160 --> 22:17.520
when they were down there was something like,

22:17.520 --> 22:19.040
did you get...

22:19.040 --> 22:21.440
You gotta check out this dude's nuts.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.480
Something like that.

22:22.480 --> 22:25.280
Did you see this dude's huge nuts?

22:25.280 --> 22:26.720
Something like that.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.320
I do remember him saying like,

22:28.320 --> 22:30.240
wow, these are so regular.

22:30.240 --> 22:33.120
Just a normal kind that everybody has.

22:33.120 --> 22:35.360
This just right in the middle of the median.

22:35.360 --> 22:36.400
The whole thing.

22:36.400 --> 22:37.280
It's just so average.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.640
You see him from the outside and you're like,

22:38.640 --> 22:39.360
whoa, big nuts.

22:39.360 --> 22:40.640
But you get in there.

22:40.640 --> 22:41.680
Not that big, dude.

22:42.560 --> 22:43.920
It's an optimal illusion, dude.

22:43.920 --> 22:44.800
Can you believe this?

22:46.800 --> 22:47.280
No, look at it.

22:47.280 --> 22:48.480
Kind of cross your eyes.

22:48.480 --> 22:49.040
It's a rhino.

22:49.040 --> 22:51.120
Dude's got razzle dazzle on his balls.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.320
So sick, dude.

22:52.320 --> 22:53.920
Hey, hey, hey.

22:53.920 --> 22:56.080
Start Amber by 311 over again.

22:56.080 --> 22:56.880
It just ran out.

22:56.880 --> 22:57.920
Flip the tape.

22:57.920 --> 22:58.960
I got distracted.

23:00.400 --> 23:01.920
I just remember I started chanting,

23:01.920 --> 23:03.520
peer sit, peer sit.

23:03.520 --> 23:04.320
Like I'm already...

23:04.320 --> 23:05.280
It's fine down there.

23:05.280 --> 23:07.440
Yeah, you're already there.

23:07.440 --> 23:09.920
What's a good song to get of it?

23:09.920 --> 23:15.040
I mean, Justin, were you hurting for a distraction?

23:15.040 --> 23:17.920
Were you like, boy, I wish I had something else to think about

23:17.920 --> 23:21.200
to get my mind off what's happening down there?

23:21.200 --> 23:22.240
I was high.

23:22.240 --> 23:23.920
I mean, I was high on drugs.

23:23.920 --> 23:24.480
Right, right.

23:24.480 --> 23:25.600
I didn't...

23:25.600 --> 23:26.800
I don't want to...

23:27.840 --> 23:30.960
I was trying to fall asleep and I couldn't.

23:30.960 --> 23:33.200
And they told me I couldn't fall asleep.

23:33.200 --> 23:34.880
I didn't want to be around for it.

23:34.880 --> 23:37.520
I wanted to step out of the building for a few moments

23:37.520 --> 23:41.280
and come back to my ruined penis.

23:41.280 --> 23:42.560
But I couldn't.

23:42.560 --> 23:43.360
I couldn't.

23:43.360 --> 23:45.200
I was like very present in the moment,

23:45.200 --> 23:46.640
but there was just chattering away,

23:46.640 --> 23:47.920
just talking, talking, talking.

23:47.920 --> 23:48.720
Yeah, that's interesting.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.000
I do remember them saying like,

23:50.000 --> 23:51.520
I can't believe this guy's laughing.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.560
That's the one quote I remember.

23:54.560 --> 23:55.760
They couldn't believe that I was like,

23:56.480 --> 23:57.440
chuckling it up.

23:57.440 --> 23:58.720
What were you laughing about?

23:58.720 --> 23:59.280
Can you remember?

24:00.880 --> 24:02.000
No, I really...

24:02.000 --> 24:02.640
My memory...

24:02.640 --> 24:04.880
I feel like I did have memories at the beginning

24:04.880 --> 24:07.040
and whatever, they have been replaced by,

24:08.000 --> 24:11.200
I guess, like animal crossing strats or something.

24:11.200 --> 24:11.760
I don't know.

24:13.600 --> 24:14.880
You're probably laughing because at one point,

24:14.880 --> 24:15.760
one of the doctors was like,

24:16.560 --> 24:20.240
I need that clamp right there and can you hand me these?

24:21.360 --> 24:22.880
And then he just kind of waited.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.000
Just kind of waited.

24:24.000 --> 24:24.560
It's rare that you have...

24:24.560 --> 24:25.440
Doctor, you do this every time.

24:25.440 --> 24:25.920
We can't.

24:27.280 --> 24:29.200
This is our eighth vasectomy today.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.800
Please, please.

24:30.800 --> 24:31.920
I like bro surgeon.

24:31.920 --> 24:34.400
Bro surgeon's my new favorite guy.

24:34.400 --> 24:35.280
Hey, how about a Yahoo?

24:36.560 --> 24:37.920
I do remember this.

24:37.920 --> 24:39.440
After they had given me the gas,

24:39.440 --> 24:42.160
the doctor came in wearing a hooker shell necklace

24:42.160 --> 24:43.520
and I was too late.

24:43.520 --> 24:44.720
I just couldn't...

24:44.720 --> 24:45.760
I couldn't stop.

24:45.760 --> 24:47.200
At that point, it was like,

24:47.200 --> 24:48.800
I can't stand up and walk out.

24:48.800 --> 24:49.920
They were at a gas ring.

24:49.920 --> 24:52.400
I'm in for the ride of my life.

24:54.640 --> 24:57.120
Here is a Yahoo sent in by Adrian Cowles.

24:57.120 --> 24:57.680
Thank you, Adrian.

24:57.680 --> 24:59.280
It's an anonymous Yahoo answers user

24:59.280 --> 25:02.640
who I'm going to call famous.

25:02.640 --> 25:05.840
Asks, in college,

25:06.560 --> 25:09.680
what's the punishment for roughhousing in class?

25:12.320 --> 25:14.000
And then that's the end of the question.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.800
And we're not talking about fighting.

25:20.640 --> 25:21.440
When you fight...

25:23.120 --> 25:24.240
In high school, if you fight,

25:24.240 --> 25:25.520
you're out of here, mister.

25:25.520 --> 25:27.280
Like not in my school.

25:27.280 --> 25:29.440
We're here trying to educate

25:29.440 --> 25:32.000
and enrich these young lives and souls

25:32.960 --> 25:34.160
so that they get to go to heaven.

25:34.160 --> 25:37.120
And I'm talking about roughhousing,

25:37.120 --> 25:38.960
which is kind of just rough play.

25:42.080 --> 25:45.600
Pressing hard in your friend's armpit

25:46.400 --> 25:48.160
and they fall over accidentally.

25:48.160 --> 25:52.400
Like roughhousing, like a noogie.

25:52.400 --> 25:53.600
Yeah, like a noogie, right?

25:53.600 --> 25:58.320
Where you wouldn't necessarily say there's ill intent,

25:58.320 --> 25:59.440
but if you found out later

25:59.440 --> 26:01.600
that that person does not like you,

26:01.600 --> 26:02.640
you'd be like, oh, okay.

26:02.640 --> 26:04.240
This makes a lot of sense now.

26:04.240 --> 26:06.320
Giving a friend a pink belly.

26:08.320 --> 26:09.360
Too much.

26:09.360 --> 26:10.560
Saying, friend, pull up that shirt.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.480
But okay, but I'm in college

26:12.480 --> 26:13.920
and I am learning about law

26:13.920 --> 26:15.520
because I'm about to be a lawyer.

26:15.520 --> 26:18.320
And my friend accidentally lifts up his shirt

26:18.320 --> 26:19.440
and I say pink belly.

26:19.440 --> 26:20.800
I give him pink belly.

26:20.800 --> 26:22.240
Am I going to, what's the...

26:22.240 --> 26:26.160
Like what is the lawyer professor gonna fucking do?

26:28.320 --> 26:30.880
It's not how to get away with murder.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.400
It's not how to get away with pink belly.

26:33.920 --> 26:34.560
What if it was?

26:35.120 --> 26:36.320
What if it was?

26:36.320 --> 26:37.600
Welcome to my new show.

26:37.600 --> 26:38.560
The perfect pink belly.

26:38.560 --> 26:39.440
The perfect pink belly.

26:41.200 --> 26:41.920
Wouldn't that be wild

26:41.920 --> 26:43.280
if you just lift up your shirt and be like,

26:43.280 --> 26:46.480
hey, okay, no one's gonna believe me,

26:47.360 --> 26:49.280
but my belly's pink and it stinks

26:49.280 --> 26:55.280
and I know one of you did it.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.720
Let's show me your hands.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
As one lone student just whistles

27:00.000 --> 27:01.760
as they leave out the door

27:01.760 --> 27:04.960
and then it's like, I put it all together.

27:04.960 --> 27:06.640
The lights go off and there's a scream

27:06.640 --> 27:07.920
and a chandelier falls.

27:10.560 --> 27:11.760
Who punctured my belly?

27:11.760 --> 27:12.560
Like candles.

27:13.200 --> 27:16.240
One person has a pink belly.

27:16.240 --> 27:17.920
Somebody pink to Donald.

27:17.920 --> 27:18.880
Who did this?

27:18.880 --> 27:20.320
Everybody put your hand print up

27:20.320 --> 27:22.240
against the hand print on my belly quickly

27:22.240 --> 27:23.200
before it disappears.

27:24.320 --> 27:25.840
Don't have much time.

27:25.840 --> 27:28.160
I'm already moving past this inconvenience.

27:28.160 --> 27:29.520
It couldn't have been me.

27:29.520 --> 27:31.840
I had honey all over my palm

27:31.840 --> 27:33.440
from that sandwich I received.

27:33.440 --> 27:35.200
If I had pinked your belly,

27:35.200 --> 27:36.880
there would be honey residue.

27:37.440 --> 27:39.360
Yeah, and you were loudly announcing

27:39.360 --> 27:40.800
right before the lights went out

27:40.800 --> 27:42.000
how you were really enjoying

27:42.000 --> 27:43.840
your super stinky sandwich.

27:43.840 --> 27:45.760
Yes, so you see, it couldn't be I.

27:46.320 --> 27:47.680
Reginald's slab belly.

27:47.680 --> 27:49.600
You're being really quiet over there, Lawrence.

27:50.320 --> 27:52.480
Oh, Griffin, you're Lawrence.

27:52.480 --> 27:54.720
Oh, yeah, yeah, man.

27:57.520 --> 27:59.040
Oh, yeah, dude.

27:59.040 --> 28:00.720
Oh, man, pink belly, huh?

28:00.720 --> 28:01.680
That's the pits.

28:02.880 --> 28:06.320
Lawrence, I heard thou in the lavatory.

28:06.320 --> 28:08.160
Why do you talk like that?

28:08.160 --> 28:10.880
I'm a foreign exchange student from the past.

28:13.920 --> 28:16.720
I saw a lot of shit in mid school

28:16.720 --> 28:19.920
and high school, vis-a-vis.

28:19.920 --> 28:21.200
Did you call it mid school?

28:21.200 --> 28:22.000
Vis-a-vis.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.040
Yeah, vis-a-vis.

28:23.920 --> 28:25.280
That's what the cool kids call it.

28:25.280 --> 28:28.000
People doing a big fight or a wrestle

28:28.000 --> 28:31.520
or horseplay in class

28:31.520 --> 28:32.720
that got a little out of hand.

28:32.720 --> 28:33.920
Once I did a horse playing class

28:33.920 --> 28:34.560
that got out of hand,

28:34.560 --> 28:36.160
I got detention in middle school.

28:36.160 --> 28:38.080
I accidentally knocked the table over

28:38.080 --> 28:42.560
and it grazed a young girl's leg

28:43.120 --> 28:45.440
and I got written up

28:45.440 --> 28:47.280
and on the pink slip, the teacher wrote,

28:48.240 --> 28:50.000
in an effort to be cute,

28:50.560 --> 28:52.720
Griffin flipped a table over

28:52.720 --> 28:56.480
and mauled a young woman

28:56.480 --> 28:58.320
who then had to go to the hospital.

28:58.320 --> 28:59.520
Like, no, that was true.

28:59.520 --> 29:00.560
And I wasn't trying to be cute.

29:00.560 --> 29:01.600
I didn't appreciate that.

29:01.600 --> 29:03.200
But I got sent to detention.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.800
Nothing like that.

29:04.800 --> 29:06.160
I don't think I ever saw anybody go.

29:06.960 --> 29:07.520
Let's start here.

29:07.520 --> 29:08.640
Does college have detention?

29:09.680 --> 29:10.640
It has to, right?

29:11.360 --> 29:11.840
Because if not-

29:11.840 --> 29:12.560
You live there.

29:12.560 --> 29:13.440
What are the fucking-

29:13.440 --> 29:14.000
You live there.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.760
What are the fucking stakes?

29:16.800 --> 29:18.880
Maybe that's the secret.

29:18.880 --> 29:19.600
Well, hold on.

29:20.160 --> 29:21.120
If in real life,

29:21.120 --> 29:22.400
let's take it one step further.

29:22.400 --> 29:24.240
If in real life I horseplay,

29:24.240 --> 29:25.360
I could go to jail, right?

29:25.360 --> 29:26.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:26.080 --> 29:26.880
They don't call it that.

29:26.880 --> 29:27.920
When you do horseplay

29:27.920 --> 29:29.360
and you hurt someone in real life,

29:29.360 --> 29:31.120
they don't call it horseplay anymore.

29:31.120 --> 29:32.480
No, they call it assault.

29:32.480 --> 29:33.920
They call it assault.

29:33.920 --> 29:36.560
And if I do that in high school,

29:36.560 --> 29:38.000
I go to detention.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.080
Why, Griffin, as you're pointing out,

29:40.080 --> 29:42.720
is college this like safe,

29:42.720 --> 29:44.560
uncanny Middle Valley thing

29:44.560 --> 29:45.840
of just like horseplay here?

29:46.400 --> 29:47.600
You're fine.

29:47.600 --> 29:48.160
You're fine.

29:48.720 --> 29:51.120
I want to know what dies in us

29:51.840 --> 29:53.760
when we graduate high school

29:53.760 --> 29:55.120
where we no longer feel like

29:55.120 --> 29:56.880
doing an awful waffle to our friends

29:56.880 --> 29:58.240
in the middle of our history class.

29:59.440 --> 30:00.240
I don't get it.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.160
Too much going on, I guess.

30:03.280 --> 30:04.720
I guess beer, right?

30:04.720 --> 30:05.200
Oh.

30:05.200 --> 30:06.400
Oh, man.

30:06.400 --> 30:07.120
Is that it?

30:07.120 --> 30:08.080
And probably beer?

30:08.080 --> 30:09.680
Getting laid.

30:09.680 --> 30:12.240
Well, I don't know about that.

30:12.240 --> 30:13.600
Yeah, bro.

30:13.600 --> 30:15.040
So I've gotten laid before

30:15.040 --> 30:16.880
and wanted to do an awful waffle

30:16.880 --> 30:18.160
immediately after.

30:18.160 --> 30:19.920
Really?

30:19.920 --> 30:22.800
Which my sexual partner was not into.

30:22.800 --> 30:25.280
And so I had to quell those dark urges

30:25.280 --> 30:27.760
back inside and write them down

30:27.760 --> 30:29.440
in my sex journal.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.160
Speaking of sex journals,

30:34.160 --> 30:35.440
should we go to the money zone?

30:35.440 --> 30:45.040
Let's go.

30:47.040 --> 30:49.040
We do have a sponsor this week.

30:49.040 --> 30:51.040
It is Honey.

30:52.320 --> 30:53.280
I actually, you know what?

30:53.280 --> 30:55.840
I installed this little doohickey

30:55.840 --> 30:56.800
on my Chrome browser.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.120
And I tell you, it has saved me

31:01.120 --> 31:02.720
a fair bit of money.

31:02.720 --> 31:03.760
It makes it really easy.

31:03.760 --> 31:05.440
Actually, you install it.

31:05.440 --> 31:06.400
There's just a few clicks

31:06.400 --> 31:07.600
and you get it for free.

31:07.600 --> 31:09.840
And then when you get to the apply coupons

31:09.840 --> 31:11.280
part of the checkout,

31:11.280 --> 31:13.520
Honey just checks a bunch of coupons

31:13.520 --> 31:15.680
to see if there's any that will work for you.

31:15.680 --> 31:18.160
And a lot of times,

31:18.160 --> 31:19.280
I'm like, hey, here's one.

31:19.280 --> 31:20.400
I'll save you a few bucks.

31:20.400 --> 31:20.880
It's nice.

31:20.880 --> 31:23.680
I saved like 10 bucks

31:23.680 --> 31:25.120
off a pair of headphones

31:25.120 --> 31:26.320
that I was buying.

31:26.320 --> 31:27.520
Do you think they tried to call

31:27.520 --> 31:28.960
the business money,

31:28.960 --> 31:30.560
but then they mistyped it

31:30.560 --> 31:32.160
that they had already spent

31:32.160 --> 31:35.840
the dollars at GoDaddy?

31:35.840 --> 31:36.800
That's probably it.

31:36.800 --> 31:39.280
Honey works on over 30,000 stores

31:39.280 --> 31:40.640
and they add more every day.

31:40.640 --> 31:44.080
And with over 100,000 five-star reviews,

31:44.080 --> 31:46.000
I mean, they gotta be doing something right.

31:46.000 --> 31:46.800
You know?

31:47.760 --> 31:49.440
It's a cool service.

31:49.440 --> 31:50.240
You should check it out.

31:50.240 --> 31:52.800
Visit joinhoney.com slash brother.

31:52.800 --> 31:55.360

31:55.360 --> 31:56.160
Give it a whirl.

31:56.160 --> 31:58.240

31:58.240 --> 32:02.960
It's joinhoney.com slash brother.

32:02.960 --> 32:05.920
Welcome back to Fireside Chat on KMAX.

32:05.920 --> 32:07.840
With me in studio to take your calls

32:07.840 --> 32:10.320
is the dopest duo on the West Coast,

32:10.320 --> 32:12.960
Oliver Wong and Morgan Rhodes.

32:12.960 --> 32:14.160
Go ahead, caller.

32:14.160 --> 32:16.400
Hey, I'm looking for a music podcast

32:16.400 --> 32:18.240
that's insightful and thoughtful,

32:18.240 --> 32:20.320
but like also helps me discover artists

32:20.320 --> 32:21.760
and albums that I've never heard of.

32:21.760 --> 32:22.240
Yeah, man.

32:22.240 --> 32:23.920
Sounds like you need to listen to Heat Rocks.

32:23.920 --> 32:26.080
Every week, myself and I'm Morgan Rhodes.

32:26.080 --> 32:28.320
And my co-host here, Oliver Wong,

32:28.320 --> 32:31.360
talk to influential guests about a canonical album

32:31.360 --> 32:33.440
that has changed their lives.

32:33.440 --> 32:35.760
Guests like Moby, Open Mike Eagle,

32:35.760 --> 32:38.240
talk about albums by Prince, Joni Mitchell,

32:38.240 --> 32:39.520
and so much more.

32:39.520 --> 32:41.600
Yo, what's that show called again?

32:41.600 --> 32:44.400
Heat Rocks, deep dives into hot records.

32:44.400 --> 32:46.480
Every Thursday on Maximum Fun.

32:48.480 --> 32:49.760
I have a question for you guys.

32:49.760 --> 32:50.260
Okay.

32:51.280 --> 32:52.720
And we're definitely gonna like,

32:52.720 --> 32:56.400
you know, we're gonna be, like I said,

32:56.400 --> 32:58.960
it's gonna be a little mix.

32:58.960 --> 33:01.440
Okay, grip it, not me.

33:01.440 --> 33:03.360
Wait, who's first thing you'll grip?

33:03.360 --> 33:04.720
Oh, well, I don't care if Travis does.

33:04.720 --> 33:06.080
I saved it.

33:06.080 --> 33:06.560
Okay.

33:06.560 --> 33:07.920
Because I wanted to frame Justin,

33:07.920 --> 33:08.960
but then he instantly was like,

33:08.960 --> 33:09.440
it wasn't me.

33:10.640 --> 33:11.920
Can we go back and like,

33:11.920 --> 33:13.280
pretend it was Justin for a while

33:13.280 --> 33:14.800
and do some jacuzzi?

33:14.800 --> 33:15.840
That would be funny.

33:16.480 --> 33:17.280
It would be funny,

33:17.280 --> 33:18.720
but we've already kind of blown it.

33:18.720 --> 33:19.680
Next time, next time.

33:19.680 --> 33:21.680
Next time, two of us will grip it and grip it,

33:21.680 --> 33:23.040
and we will be up to the audience to decide.

33:23.040 --> 33:24.800
Why do you keep, Travis, Travis, Travis.

33:24.800 --> 33:25.360
Yeah.

33:25.360 --> 33:27.200
Where does that voice, what part,

33:27.200 --> 33:28.480
where does that voice deep inside of you?

33:28.480 --> 33:30.160
It's Riddle Me, Piss Guy, and he won't leave.

33:30.160 --> 33:31.440
It's like the third time Riddle Me,

33:31.440 --> 33:32.560
Piss Guy has showed up this episode,

33:32.560 --> 33:34.160
and I wish he would, here's the door.

33:34.160 --> 33:36.400
It's me, Riddle M. Pissworth.

33:36.400 --> 33:38.240
Yeah, get out of here, Riddle M. Pissworth.

33:38.240 --> 33:39.200
I don't want you.

33:39.200 --> 33:40.560
I want Travis.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.400
But I paid to be here.

33:42.400 --> 33:43.200
We love Travis.

33:43.200 --> 33:43.920
I hate you.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.520
Did you hear that, Riddle M. Pissworth?

33:47.520 --> 33:49.120
They finally chose me.

33:49.120 --> 33:52.880
Right before the unpleasantness began,

33:53.600 --> 33:59.200
the last two big hit shows on Netflix that we got like,

33:59.200 --> 34:00.480
I don't know if everybody on this call,

34:00.480 --> 34:02.160
I'm pretty sure almost everybody on this call

34:02.160 --> 34:04.080
got obsessed with at least one of these, right?

34:04.640 --> 34:07.760
The last two big Netflix, like Sweep the Globe,

34:08.320 --> 34:12.240
huge hits, was one, The Circle,

34:12.800 --> 34:15.040
which imprisoned people in apartments

34:15.040 --> 34:17.120
and forced them to only contact each other

34:17.120 --> 34:18.320
through social networking.

34:18.320 --> 34:18.960
Yes. Right?

34:19.680 --> 34:23.680
The second big one right after that is Love is Blind,

34:23.680 --> 34:25.840
where people were put into isolation

34:25.840 --> 34:27.920
and forced to fall in love and marry each other.

34:27.920 --> 34:28.160
Yes.

34:28.880 --> 34:30.640
So my question is this.

34:31.440 --> 34:33.760
Did Taco Bell, not Taco Bell.

34:33.760 --> 34:34.400
Wait, what?

34:34.400 --> 34:35.520
I don't know why I said Taco Bell.

34:35.520 --> 34:36.960
Justin, no, hold on.

34:36.960 --> 34:40.160
Well, why did you just confuse Netflix and Taco Bell, son?

34:41.680 --> 34:44.800
I was thinking about Taco Bell's response to the unpleasantness.

34:44.800 --> 34:51.680
Did Netflix get in right under the wire

34:51.680 --> 34:55.520
or right before peak relevance?

34:55.520 --> 34:56.400
That's my question.

34:56.400 --> 34:56.880
Oh.

34:56.880 --> 35:00.720
Did these show, the timing of these shows is wild either way.

35:00.720 --> 35:01.440
It is wild.

35:01.440 --> 35:04.800
And I hope if this passes prologue

35:04.800 --> 35:07.440
vis-a-vis Netflix's programming,

35:07.440 --> 35:08.640
I sure hope we don't hit,

35:08.640 --> 35:10.400
I sure hope we don't get a bird box.

35:12.720 --> 35:14.160
Yeah, I guess that's true, girl.

35:14.160 --> 35:16.240
Now you're hoping that a real bird box doesn't happen?

35:16.960 --> 35:19.680
But a Terrace House would be fantastic.

35:19.680 --> 35:21.680
No, if Terrace House were to really happen,

35:21.680 --> 35:22.640
that would be so exciting.

35:22.640 --> 35:23.040
That would be so exciting.

35:23.040 --> 35:24.560
Real people would live together

35:25.200 --> 35:27.040
and get to know each other by living together.

35:27.040 --> 35:28.160
That would be incredible.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.200
Instead of a bird box,

35:29.200 --> 35:32.160
I would rather we all do a To All the Boys I've Loved Before

35:32.160 --> 35:33.600
is where I would rather be.

35:33.600 --> 35:34.160
Definitely, definitely.

35:34.160 --> 35:35.360
That's the world I wanna live in.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.560
You know what world I wanna live in?

35:38.560 --> 35:39.600
The Boss Baby world.

35:40.480 --> 35:42.640
Justin, can you make them do Boss Baby world?

35:42.640 --> 35:46.160
Uh, I guess I could try to get the world of Boss Baby going.

35:46.160 --> 35:46.720
Okay.

35:46.720 --> 35:48.080
You seem to know people, Justin.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.680
I don't know how you're all connected, but-

35:49.680 --> 35:54.320
Tell them.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.360
I thought you said-

35:58.960 --> 36:00.000
I want a munch.

36:00.000 --> 36:00.800
Squad.

36:03.440 --> 36:05.200
I want to munch.

36:05.200 --> 36:06.000
Squad.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.520
Squad.

36:09.520 --> 36:09.760
Okay.

36:11.360 --> 36:14.240
You know, there's still gonna be one up in the mix.

36:14.240 --> 36:15.760
Come on, they're not stopping.

36:16.720 --> 36:19.520
All of the others will be turned,

36:19.520 --> 36:22.080
but rising is still Taco Bell.

36:22.080 --> 36:22.640
Okay, now it's-

36:22.640 --> 36:25.360
See, I had my suspicions

36:26.080 --> 36:28.960
when Justin had his Freudian slip of the tongue

36:29.520 --> 36:31.440
that perhaps might be a munch slot on the horizon.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.040
I had that Taco Bell time open,

36:33.040 --> 36:34.400
ready to pull the trigger on it,

36:34.400 --> 36:36.080
and I just went too soon.

36:36.080 --> 36:36.720
Taco Bell-

36:38.400 --> 36:40.000
I want to frame this for y'all

36:40.000 --> 36:41.200
before I get into the press release.

36:42.640 --> 36:45.120
I think that we're going to be talking about

36:45.120 --> 36:48.880
the longest shell ever with the triple lupa.

36:48.880 --> 36:49.360
Huh.

36:49.360 --> 36:52.000
The ultimate reinvention of the fan favorite chalupa.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.120
It's the triple lupa.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.440
I guess what I'm thinking is

36:58.800 --> 37:01.280
there had to be someone at Taco Bell

37:01.280 --> 37:02.480
in the past couple weeks,

37:02.480 --> 37:04.320
as bad as things have been,

37:04.320 --> 37:06.000
I will tell you that there's someone

37:06.000 --> 37:07.760
I've talked about in the past couple weeks

37:07.760 --> 37:09.600
that at some point has had the thought,

37:10.640 --> 37:12.880
man, now nobody's going to talk about the triple lupa.

37:14.720 --> 37:15.280
Yeah.

37:15.280 --> 37:17.920
Three shells, three flavors.

37:17.920 --> 37:18.480
Huh.

37:18.480 --> 37:21.360
The triple lupa triples the flavor

37:21.360 --> 37:23.600
and doubles the beef in Taco Bell's

37:23.600 --> 37:25.680
first tear apart menu item.

37:25.680 --> 37:27.600
Tear apart menu item?

37:28.560 --> 37:28.960
Terror?

37:28.960 --> 37:30.880
Tear apart menu item.

37:30.880 --> 37:34.160
I would argue any item at Taco Bell

37:34.160 --> 37:36.080
is tear apart if you want it.

37:36.080 --> 37:36.640
If you believe.

37:36.640 --> 37:37.200
If you need it.

37:37.200 --> 37:37.360
Yeah.

37:38.480 --> 37:40.640
Taco Bell is no stranger to giving fans

37:40.640 --> 37:42.240
more of what they love.

37:42.240 --> 37:43.680
And now the latest reinvention

37:43.680 --> 37:46.240
of the iconic chalupa gives fans

37:46.240 --> 37:48.960
three times the reason to get excited.

37:48.960 --> 37:50.320
Launching for a limited time

37:50.320 --> 37:52.560
in participating restaurants nationwide

37:52.560 --> 37:53.440
on March 12th.

37:53.440 --> 37:54.000
Ooh.

37:54.000 --> 37:54.500
The tr-

37:55.520 --> 37:56.160
That's tough.

37:56.800 --> 38:00.160
The triple lupa serves as a hands-on experience

38:00.160 --> 38:02.080
with three mini chalupas

38:02.080 --> 38:03.680
featuring three flavors

38:03.680 --> 38:05.280
and double the seasoned beef

38:05.280 --> 38:06.880
compared to the regular chalupa.

38:07.520 --> 38:09.520
Combining three mini chalupas

38:09.520 --> 38:10.960
to create the longest shell

38:10.960 --> 38:12.720
in Taco Bell history.

38:12.720 --> 38:14.880
The triple lupa marks Taco Bell's

38:14.880 --> 38:17.040
first ever tear apart menu item.

38:17.040 --> 38:18.880
It takes all the elements of the chalupa

38:18.880 --> 38:19.840
to the next level

38:19.840 --> 38:20.880
with different flavors

38:20.880 --> 38:22.560
in each of the mini shells.

38:22.560 --> 38:23.120
Nachos.

38:23.120 --> 38:25.200
Do you see how they've become mini shells?

38:25.200 --> 38:27.200
Solely solely by the fact

38:27.200 --> 38:29.680
that there's three of them joined together.

38:29.680 --> 38:30.880
Now they're mini shells.

38:30.880 --> 38:31.840
It's bite size.

38:31.840 --> 38:33.920
It's like they've made a flight of chalupas

38:33.920 --> 38:36.000
but it's like a concentric flight.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.280
There's nacho cheese on one end.

38:39.280 --> 38:40.640
Chipotle on the other.

38:40.640 --> 38:43.200
And a combination of the two.

38:43.200 --> 38:45.120
Cheesy chipotle in the third.

38:45.120 --> 38:45.840
Okay, fuck off.

38:45.840 --> 38:47.600
That's not three flavors.

38:47.600 --> 38:49.120
That's not three flavors.

38:49.120 --> 38:51.200
That's a messy spot in the middle

38:51.200 --> 38:53.280
where you can't separate the two.

38:53.280 --> 38:54.480
Justin, can I ask you a question?

38:55.280 --> 38:56.080
Yeah, I'm not.

38:56.080 --> 38:57.200
Is it about the triple lupa?

38:57.200 --> 38:58.320
Because it's all I care about.

38:58.320 --> 39:00.720
I'm not as in touch with the quick service industry

39:00.720 --> 39:01.200
as you are.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.480
Was there ever a double lupa

39:04.480 --> 39:05.920
or did they just skip straight

39:05.920 --> 39:07.920
from single lupa to triple lupa?

39:07.920 --> 39:08.800
Because if so,

39:08.800 --> 39:10.080
I feel like they have missed

39:10.880 --> 39:12.640
a very important milestone here.

39:12.640 --> 39:14.640
There's a market there for the double lupa

39:14.640 --> 39:16.800
for those of us who are scared of the triple lupa.

39:16.800 --> 39:17.280
Yes.

39:17.280 --> 39:19.040
If we can find a way to fill that niche,

39:19.040 --> 39:20.560
fill the South Park niche,

39:20.560 --> 39:21.440
we're gonna be in the money.

39:21.440 --> 39:23.920
The double lupa is not on sale right now

39:23.920 --> 39:26.320
but it's just called the double chalupa.

39:26.320 --> 39:28.240
Okay, so it's two,

39:28.240 --> 39:31.120
it's a double wide basically.

39:31.120 --> 39:32.240
Yeah, if they-

39:32.240 --> 39:32.640
Double chalupa.

39:32.640 --> 39:33.520
But that's not the same.

39:34.160 --> 39:35.920
If they were gonna skip ahead,

39:35.920 --> 39:37.920
they should have just gone straight to the quadrupa.

39:40.720 --> 39:43.280
Well, that's just two of those squished together

39:43.280 --> 39:44.720
by a very strong man.

39:44.720 --> 39:45.920
That's a good point.

39:49.200 --> 39:51.120
Okay, so the triple lupa,

39:51.120 --> 39:52.960
getting back into the mix here.

39:52.960 --> 39:54.640
Since the introduction in 1999,

39:54.640 --> 39:57.680
the beloved menu item has continuously transformed in shape,

39:57.680 --> 40:00.080
form and ingredients to become the most reinvented

40:00.080 --> 40:02.080
Taco Bell menu item of all time.

40:02.080 --> 40:03.200
Weird brag.

40:03.200 --> 40:09.040
We just can't seem to get this fucking thing right.

40:09.040 --> 40:10.720
All our fans agree.

40:10.720 --> 40:12.240
We can't get this one right.

40:14.400 --> 40:18.000
From flavor innovation like the Baja Chalupa in 2000-

40:18.000 --> 40:19.680
Which wasn't it.

40:19.680 --> 40:21.520
We know it's not a good idea.

40:21.520 --> 40:24.160
Which wasn't it, we know it wasn't it.

40:24.160 --> 40:25.520
We know we missed on that one.

40:25.520 --> 40:27.840
Don't tweet at us anymore, please.

40:28.560 --> 40:31.600
To size innovation with the double chalupa in 2017-

40:31.600 --> 40:32.640
What were we thinking?

40:33.680 --> 40:34.240
We blew it.

40:37.200 --> 40:39.840
At Taco Bell, we recognize and love the fandom

40:39.840 --> 40:42.000
that the chalupa has cultivated over the years.

40:43.600 --> 40:47.040
A fandom that is devoted to essentially a concept.

40:47.040 --> 40:49.520
Really, a brand name, really.

40:49.520 --> 40:52.160
Because this thing has been reinvented so many times.

40:52.160 --> 40:54.560
But fandom to me implies they're out there,

40:54.560 --> 40:56.480
people out there doing cosplay

40:56.480 --> 41:00.400
and writing fan fiction about the chalupa.

41:00.400 --> 41:01.280
Probably there is.

41:02.560 --> 41:05.120
It's an all new flavor and shell experience

41:05.120 --> 41:06.640
with the triple lupa.

41:06.640 --> 41:08.880
That's from Kristen Fudelan,

41:08.880 --> 41:11.360
associate manager of research and development at Taco Bell

41:11.360 --> 41:13.680
and lead product developer behind the triple lupa.

41:13.680 --> 41:16.080
The triple lupa's nationwide launch

41:16.080 --> 41:18.640
gives us the opportunity to celebrate the transformation

41:18.640 --> 41:20.240
of this beloved menu item.

41:20.240 --> 41:21.920
And we can't wait for everyone to taste

41:21.920 --> 41:22.960
this latest innovation.

41:25.440 --> 41:27.360
For the triple lupa's nationwide debut.

41:27.360 --> 41:29.920
I want to thank Taco Bell, honestly, kidding aside.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.680
I haven't thought about anything but the triple lupa

41:31.680 --> 41:32.720
for the past like three minutes

41:32.720 --> 41:34.000
and it's been pretty incredible.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.760
And this one is so long

41:35.760 --> 41:37.440
and there's no way they could have known.

41:37.440 --> 41:39.600
And they made such a long press release for this.

41:40.320 --> 41:41.120
Thank you.

41:41.120 --> 41:43.360
For the triple lupa's nationwide debut,

41:43.360 --> 41:45.200
Taco Bell is partnering with a brand

41:45.200 --> 41:47.920
known for serving up its own reinventions.

41:47.920 --> 41:49.520
Guess, right now, both of you guess.

41:49.520 --> 41:53.840
Oh my God, segue.

41:55.440 --> 41:57.200
Is that a brand?

41:57.200 --> 41:58.000
Travis?

41:58.000 --> 41:59.120
Just an invention?

41:59.120 --> 41:59.840
Oh wait, Tesla.

41:59.840 --> 42:00.880
I take it back, Tesla.

42:00.880 --> 42:02.400
Well, it's TikTok.

42:02.400 --> 42:02.720
Oh.

42:02.720 --> 42:05.200
The short form mobile video platform

42:05.200 --> 42:09.280
serves as the framework for the triple lupa's national TV spot

42:09.280 --> 42:12.320
and is the first time TikTok has partnered with a brand

42:12.320 --> 42:14.000
on a national advertising campaign.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.520
Shot in TikTok's full screen vertical video format,

42:17.520 --> 42:20.080
the ad spot follows the creative, unexpected,

42:20.080 --> 42:23.360
and joyful content the TikTok community is celebrated for,

42:23.360 --> 42:26.480
which I would assume is much less triple lupa focused now

42:26.480 --> 42:27.920
than it would have been two weeks ago.

42:28.560 --> 42:31.040
When I look back at our history with social trends,

42:31.040 --> 42:34.080
I'm proud of the fact that we are always leading the industry

42:34.080 --> 42:35.600
and pushing boundaries.

42:35.600 --> 42:38.160
Whether it's being the first on new platforms

42:38.160 --> 42:39.920
or breaking records on others,

42:39.920 --> 42:44.240
Taco Bell is constantly at the forefront of online trends,

42:44.240 --> 42:45.760
said Tracy LaRocca,

42:45.760 --> 42:48.640
senior VP of brand engagement at Taco Bell,

42:48.640 --> 42:51.040
who must have a very confusing job at the moment.

42:53.920 --> 42:56.640
The most natural step for us would be to partner

42:56.640 --> 42:58.320
with a brand like TikTok.

42:58.320 --> 42:59.040
Yep.

42:59.040 --> 43:04.880
The most natural step for our taco store would be to part...

43:06.720 --> 43:07.760
Where did it go?

43:07.760 --> 43:10.080
Oh, how did it get to here?

43:10.080 --> 43:12.480
Where the most natural step for our taco store

43:12.480 --> 43:14.720
is to partner with this small video because...

43:14.720 --> 43:17.920
Jesus, Justin, we can't say that exact sentence

43:17.920 --> 43:20.400
that you just said out loud about how did we get to here

43:20.400 --> 43:22.240
because it invites you to open up a door

43:22.240 --> 43:24.720
and do a pitch black abyss that I got.

43:24.720 --> 43:28.000
I actually got vertigo from like thinking about it

43:28.000 --> 43:29.520
and I had to close the door.

43:29.520 --> 43:30.960
I can tell you exactly how it happened.

43:30.960 --> 43:31.680
Are you ready for this?

43:31.680 --> 43:32.400
It happened like this.

43:32.400 --> 43:32.800
Yeah.

43:32.800 --> 43:36.720
Picture like a conference room table full of execs,

43:36.720 --> 43:39.040
some young, some not so young.

43:39.040 --> 43:41.440
One of them playing on his phone is Bradley.

43:41.440 --> 43:43.840
He never pays attention during these meetings.

43:43.840 --> 43:47.440
And Mr. Bell, who is of course the owner of Taco Bell,

43:47.440 --> 43:49.120
says, Bradley, what do you think?

43:49.120 --> 43:50.240
And Bradley, without thinking,

43:50.240 --> 43:51.600
just looks over and goes, TikTok?

43:52.240 --> 43:54.560
And that's how it was born.

43:54.560 --> 43:56.160
That's how most business happens.

43:56.160 --> 43:56.400
Yeah.

43:56.400 --> 44:00.080
Because of fucking Bradley and his malfeasance.

44:00.080 --> 44:03.920
And then Bradley said, TikTok-o and everyone lost their shit.

44:03.920 --> 44:05.040
I mean, that's probably it, yeah?

44:05.040 --> 44:08.800
Yeah.

44:08.800 --> 44:12.000
Oh my God, I'm looking at a triple looper right now.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.600
Taco Bell was tweeting about this.

44:14.320 --> 44:17.920
The brand is encouraging fans to jump in on the fun

44:17.920 --> 44:22.800
by participating in an upcoming Taco Bell hashtag challenge on TikTok

44:22.800 --> 44:26.640
and plans to announce more details about the challenge in the coming weeks.

44:26.640 --> 44:27.440
I doubt it.

44:28.320 --> 44:31.360
Taco Bell will also be partnering with select TikTok creators

44:31.360 --> 44:34.560
to inspire fans to reinvent something themselves

44:34.560 --> 44:36.000
and share it on the platform.

44:37.440 --> 44:41.040
So yeah, that one hasn't gotten, I'm looking at Twitter,

44:41.040 --> 44:43.760
and that one hasn't gotten a lot of the traction

44:43.760 --> 44:48.160
you would sort of hope for on that one.

44:48.160 --> 44:49.920
That one hasn't gotten a lot of heat.

44:49.920 --> 44:50.320
I tell you.

44:50.320 --> 44:52.000
The best laid plans, huh?

44:52.000 --> 44:55.680
I'm looking at this wild taco caterpillar

44:55.680 --> 44:57.680
that they have put together for me.

44:57.680 --> 45:00.640
And the only one of these that I'm interested in

45:00.640 --> 45:07.840
is the liminal lupa, the centralized sort of middle of the Venn diagram.

45:08.400 --> 45:09.120
Give me that one.

45:09.120 --> 45:11.680
I want a service that will rip the liminal lupa

45:11.680 --> 45:14.960
out of the middle of this caterpillar and mail it to my house.

45:15.760 --> 45:19.760
Now, what if I get one of these and I got two friends

45:20.480 --> 45:22.480
and one of the friends is like, I want cheesy.

45:23.040 --> 45:24.960
And the other friend said, I want Chipotle.

45:24.960 --> 45:25.920
But here's the thing, guys.

45:26.480 --> 45:28.240
I wanted Chipotle.

45:28.240 --> 45:30.880
I didn't want, now I'm stuck in the middle?

45:30.880 --> 45:32.640
With the, are we each supposed to get our own?

45:33.200 --> 45:36.480
I think you spend as long as you can arguing about that

45:37.760 --> 45:40.160
and then find another vine to swing to.

45:40.160 --> 45:41.840
Yeah, you just enjoy each other's company

45:41.840 --> 45:43.360
for the brief moment you have.

45:43.360 --> 45:45.520
I wouldn't call that enjoying company.

45:45.520 --> 45:47.920
Having a taco fight, Travis, is not enjoyable company.

45:47.920 --> 45:49.520
I'll tell you, Griffin, right now,

45:49.520 --> 45:51.120
I would love to have a taco fight with a human being.

45:51.120 --> 45:52.720
You'd love to have a taco fight, huh?

45:52.720 --> 45:54.880
Yes, that wasn't my wife and kid.

45:54.880 --> 45:57.360
I love my wife and kids, but we've had plenty of taco fights

45:57.360 --> 45:58.720
over the last couple of days.

45:58.720 --> 45:59.920
Yeah, it's not even complete.

45:59.920 --> 46:02.080
You know who's gonna win before you even get started.

46:02.080 --> 46:03.680
And it's BB.

46:03.680 --> 46:04.400
Yeah.

46:04.400 --> 46:08.240
I'm frustrated by another Taco Bell product.

46:08.240 --> 46:10.400
They got a new grande burritos.

46:10.400 --> 46:11.760
I don't have a price list about this one,

46:11.760 --> 46:15.520
but there's two new flavors of the dollar grande burritos.

46:15.520 --> 46:18.720
One of the flavor is called Loaded Taco Burrito.

46:18.720 --> 46:21.760
Huh, what are y'all doing?

46:22.640 --> 46:23.520
What are you doing?

46:24.320 --> 46:26.720
That's just two of the things.

46:26.720 --> 46:27.600
What are you doing?

46:27.600 --> 46:28.960
What if Taco Bell just tweeted like,

46:28.960 --> 46:30.960
hey, right now we realize no one's looking,

46:30.960 --> 46:33.440
so we're just gonna rename everything, everything.

46:33.440 --> 46:35.120
Because none of y'all are paying attention.

46:35.120 --> 46:36.720
We're gonna completely change our menu

46:36.720 --> 46:37.680
by the time y'all get back.

46:37.680 --> 46:39.520
Listen, we're innovators,

46:39.520 --> 46:41.680
and we are not afraid to make bold choices,

46:41.680 --> 46:44.720
and we're gonna move everything just one over to the left.

46:44.720 --> 46:46.560
Yep, and you won't notice.

46:46.560 --> 46:47.060
Good luck.

46:48.800 --> 46:51.680
Just get, you just go to the drive-thru

46:51.680 --> 46:55.120
and like, just give me a bag of sludge and bread, please.

46:55.120 --> 46:58.720
Yep, just whatever conflagration of that,

46:58.720 --> 47:02.080
whatever different permutations you have.

47:02.080 --> 47:04.480
Let me get a meat and bread.

47:04.480 --> 47:06.640
Does that say fettuccine alfredo?

47:06.640 --> 47:08.080
Taco Bell, what the fuck?

47:08.080 --> 47:09.840
Hey, wait, this is two soft tacos.

47:09.840 --> 47:11.200
Yep, you cracked the case.

47:11.200 --> 47:14.080
A conflagration is actually a fire,

47:14.080 --> 47:18.320
but that actually is a plumber, I think, in our situation.

47:20.640 --> 47:22.800
Anyway, this has been my brother, my brother, and me.

47:22.800 --> 47:25.520
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

47:27.040 --> 47:29.360
We hope that we could,

47:29.360 --> 47:33.920
and we'll continue to provide a little bit of cheeriness for you.

47:34.640 --> 47:38.960
Hopefully we won't spend as much time couching it,

47:38.960 --> 47:40.240
I think, next week.

47:41.280 --> 47:44.560
It would be wild not to sort of talk about it, I guess.

47:44.560 --> 47:45.600
We're just like everybody.

47:45.600 --> 47:47.760
We're fucking flying by the sea of our pants right now.

47:47.760 --> 47:50.480
We'll, you know, it's like things are,

47:50.480 --> 47:54.000
we normally record on Wednesdays and publish on Mondays.

47:54.000 --> 47:57.680
Like, it seems like things are so drastically different,

47:57.680 --> 48:01.200
even in like a four-day time span.

48:02.320 --> 48:06.640
But, you know, I really, I think we're gonna get through this.

48:06.640 --> 48:08.880
Like, we've been doing this show for almost 10 years.

48:08.880 --> 48:12.480
That's like, if we can do this show for 10 years, you know?

48:12.480 --> 48:13.120
Yeah.

48:13.120 --> 48:16.000
Wait, are you comparing talking to your brothers

48:16.000 --> 48:20.160
for an hour every week to a quarantine?

48:20.160 --> 48:24.080
I was just saying like the time shall pass,

48:24.080 --> 48:26.880
and we will figure out a new way of being.

48:26.880 --> 48:30.240
You're making it sound like once we hit 10 years though,

48:30.240 --> 48:32.720
we're out of the worst of it.

48:32.720 --> 48:33.220
Finally.

48:34.320 --> 48:37.040
I mean, I would hope we're out of the worst of this show.

48:37.040 --> 48:38.800
We're passing through the clouds now.

48:39.360 --> 48:40.640
I real quick just wanted to say,

48:41.520 --> 48:43.200
isolate yourself and wash your hands.

48:43.200 --> 48:44.880
This is the kind of thing where I still see people,

48:44.880 --> 48:46.160
even this far into the whole thing.

48:46.160 --> 48:47.920
I hate to be serious for a minute,

48:47.920 --> 48:50.400
but I see people saying, well, I'm not worried about it.

48:50.400 --> 48:51.840
Well, it's not about you.

48:51.840 --> 48:53.440
It's about everyone.

48:53.440 --> 48:55.200
And there are people that are worried about it.

48:55.200 --> 48:57.040
And the best thing that we could do right now

48:57.040 --> 48:59.360
is to self isolate and social distance

48:59.360 --> 49:01.280
and wash the hell out of your hands.

49:01.280 --> 49:02.080
Please do that.

49:02.080 --> 49:03.680
Yes, do that.

49:03.680 --> 49:04.880
I could just be a good citizen.

49:04.880 --> 49:05.680
Wash your whole body.

49:06.240 --> 49:07.840
A lot of people aren't gonna tell you to do that,

49:07.840 --> 49:11.520
but wash your feet and your butt.

49:11.520 --> 49:13.280
Like do your hands whenever you're near a sink,

49:13.280 --> 49:14.800
but don't forget about the rest of your body too.

49:14.800 --> 49:15.360
I'm worried.

49:15.360 --> 49:19.360
And here's one more thing I would say.

49:21.200 --> 49:23.600
This is just advice from somebody who's lived with anxiety

49:23.600 --> 49:25.760
for basically his whole life.

49:26.880 --> 49:30.800
Do your best to accept your scenario as it changes.

49:33.440 --> 49:38.400
Do your best to just embrace where you're at

49:38.400 --> 49:39.520
and be in that moment

49:39.520 --> 49:41.920
and don't let yourself get too far ahead

49:41.920 --> 49:43.280
because there's no way of knowing.

49:43.280 --> 49:46.640
And you know, we got today, so focus on today.

49:46.640 --> 49:48.160
And really, you know what?

49:48.160 --> 49:53.520
Really, seriously, look at your situation

49:53.520 --> 49:56.080
and say, how could the McElroy brothers address this?

49:56.080 --> 49:59.600
I need advice about the new nuance,

49:59.600 --> 50:01.120
the new meaningless things,

50:02.480 --> 50:04.960
the new meaningless conflicts in my life.

50:04.960 --> 50:06.960
And we will continue to address those

50:06.960 --> 50:08.320
because this is gonna be weird

50:08.320 --> 50:09.360
because a lot of us are gonna have

50:09.360 --> 50:11.760
a lot of the same meaningless conflicts in our life.

50:11.760 --> 50:13.440
The same meaningless challenges,

50:13.440 --> 50:15.280
the same easily overcome challenges

50:16.160 --> 50:18.160
that we can all sort of talk about

50:18.160 --> 50:19.120
and work through together.

50:19.120 --> 50:22.160
So, you know, let us know how we can help

50:22.160 --> 50:25.680
and we will continue to be there to advise

50:25.680 --> 50:28.000
through these challenging days until-

50:28.000 --> 50:30.320
Or as was the case in this episode

50:30.320 --> 50:32.880
to talk about Richard Gere and Taco Bell a whole lot.

50:32.880 --> 50:33.440
Yep.

50:33.440 --> 50:37.120
What if Richard Gere worked at Taco Bell?

50:37.120 --> 50:39.120
I think it would go a little something like this.

50:39.120 --> 50:40.160
Something like this.

50:40.160 --> 50:44.720
Something like this.

50:44.720 --> 50:46.720
My name is Justin McGrath.

50:46.720 --> 50:48.560
No, wait, no, wait, Griffin didn't say the thing.

50:48.560 --> 50:50.160
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

50:50.160 --> 50:50.960
for the use of our theme song.

50:50.960 --> 50:51.920
It's a departure off the album,

50:51.920 --> 50:52.960
putting the days to bed.

50:52.960 --> 50:54.080
Thank you to Maximum Fun.

50:55.680 --> 50:57.760
Thank you to, just thank you to you.

50:57.760 --> 50:58.320
Let's do it.

50:58.320 --> 50:59.120
Let's do that final.

51:00.160 --> 51:01.440
Yeah, we got a final yahoo.

51:01.440 --> 51:04.880
You usually don't introduce the final yourself, Griffin.

51:04.880 --> 51:06.160
It's a weird transition.

51:06.160 --> 51:08.080
So let me do it also for you.

51:08.080 --> 51:08.560
Okay.

51:08.560 --> 51:10.080
Here comes Griffin with the final yahoo.

51:10.080 --> 51:11.440
I'm gonna do the final yahoo now.

51:11.440 --> 51:12.160
Here it comes.

51:13.600 --> 51:14.560
It's from Graham Roebuck.

51:14.560 --> 51:14.960
Thanks, Graham.

51:14.960 --> 51:16.480
It's an anonymous yahoo answers user

51:17.200 --> 51:20.320
who I am gonna call Picard

51:20.320 --> 51:21.280
because there's an F for it.

51:22.000 --> 51:22.800
Picard asks,

51:25.360 --> 51:28.240
can poems have curse words in them?

51:32.080 --> 51:33.040
My name is Justin McGrath.

51:33.040 --> 51:34.320
I'm Travis McElroy.

51:34.320 --> 51:35.360
I'm Griffin McElroy.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.200
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

51:37.200 --> 51:37.840
Kiss your dad.

51:37.840 --> 51:41.600
We should change that.

51:41.600 --> 51:43.360
No, I can't.

51:43.360 --> 51:44.880
You shouldn't though, right?

51:44.880 --> 51:46.160
But your dad's fine.

51:46.720 --> 51:48.240
Everybody can kiss your dad's fur.

51:48.240 --> 51:49.280
You might not be fine.

51:50.320 --> 51:51.920
Yeah, I guess it's true.

51:51.920 --> 51:53.200
Do we need a new one?

51:54.160 --> 51:55.840
Kiss your dad from six feet away.

51:56.800 --> 51:57.600
That's impossible.

51:57.600 --> 51:59.120
Yell at your dad.

51:59.120 --> 52:01.600
Yell something affirming at your dad.

52:03.200 --> 52:03.840
Encourage it.

52:03.840 --> 52:05.360
Check on your dad with your phone.

52:05.360 --> 52:06.160
Check on your dad.

52:06.160 --> 52:07.200
Yeah.

52:07.200 --> 52:09.120
Send your dad the kissy face emoji.

52:10.160 --> 52:11.040
We'll just keep it.

52:11.040 --> 52:11.920
It'll be weird

52:11.920 --> 52:13.520
because in a few months,

52:13.520 --> 52:15.280
people have forgotten all about this

52:15.280 --> 52:16.960
and I don't wanna make it weird for them

52:16.960 --> 52:18.320
when they listen to the ending.

52:18.320 --> 52:21.440
Imagine those quotes around kiss and lives.

52:22.480 --> 52:25.120
Yeah, for yourself now, imagine that.

52:25.120 --> 52:27.840
I hate actually putting those quotes there, Travis.

52:27.840 --> 52:28.320
Yeah, you know.

52:28.320 --> 52:30.400
I want you to write it down

52:30.400 --> 52:32.320
and I want you to read it

52:32.320 --> 52:34.720
and then think about your actions and your sayings.

52:34.720 --> 52:35.920
Kiss.

52:35.920 --> 52:37.600
I would actually hazard to say

52:37.600 --> 52:40.240
that every word of it is worse with quotes.

52:40.240 --> 52:41.520
Like there's not a thing in there

52:41.520 --> 52:42.880
you put quotes around and it works.

52:42.880 --> 52:44.320
Kiss your dad.

52:44.320 --> 52:45.760
Kiss your dad.

52:45.760 --> 53:04.320
Yeah, any words are bad.
