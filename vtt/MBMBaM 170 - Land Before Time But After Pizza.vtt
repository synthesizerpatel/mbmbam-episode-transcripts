00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.600 --> 00:10.400
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.360 --> 00:16.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:16.000 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:50.400
Welcome to My Brother My Brother Me, a very honored advice show for the modern era. I'm

00:50.400 --> 00:54.560
your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother Travis McElroy. I'm your baby

00:54.560 --> 01:01.520
brother Griffin McElroy. Gosh, could not, this is huge. I want to say, uh, gosh, where to start,

01:01.520 --> 01:08.640
thank you so much. Uh, welcome to new listeners, I guess, obviously. Uh, and thank you so much to

01:08.640 --> 01:17.120
Vince Gilligan, Gilliam, Vince, or what he just said to us. Gungan. Vince Gundham. Thank you,

01:17.120 --> 01:24.800
uh, creator of Breaking Bad. Uh, seeing My Brother My Brother Me referenced, uh, so many times. I

01:24.800 --> 01:31.200
counted 18, 18 discrete references to My Brother My Brother. I mean, it started innocuously enough.

01:31.920 --> 01:39.600
Like when, uh, uh, Jesse was like, guys, I've got to, I, listen to me, Beaver and Trunch,

01:40.160 --> 01:45.920
his two friends. I got it. I don't want to listen to hardcore rap anymore. I've got a podcast that

01:45.920 --> 01:51.520
you guys are going to love. And then there was just, uh, how, what seemed to be a 16 to 17 minute

01:51.520 --> 01:58.320
segment that was just Jesse clip from our show, like Beaver and Trunch listening to our show.

01:58.320 --> 02:02.160
And it was weird because it was basically this like Jesse staring expectantly at Beaver and

02:02.160 --> 02:07.840
Trunch, like going, ah, you like this, right? Just wait, just wait, wait till they get to the

02:07.840 --> 02:12.320
extreme. They do this one bit about horses. They do this. They do these 1000 different bits about

02:12.320 --> 02:20.080
horses. It was a weirdly tense scene. Um, but not like a violent tense, but more like a awkward

02:20.080 --> 02:27.120
tense because nobody was laughing. Um, but then it just sort of went on from there. Uh, so, uh,

02:27.120 --> 02:32.240
my favorite part, I loved when, um, uh, Lamont Cranston's character, what's his name? Lamont

02:32.240 --> 02:36.800
Cranston. Lamont Cranston. Well, Lamont Cranston was cooking up some of his meth and somebody

02:36.800 --> 02:40.640
tasted it and they said like, ah, this meth is sweeter than the goofs on My Brother My Brother

02:40.640 --> 02:46.480
and Me. Yeah. Like really blatant. That one felt a little bit forced to me. There were those three

02:46.480 --> 02:51.440
brothers that bought meth from him. Um, even though he's been out of the game for a while,

02:51.440 --> 02:54.720
which is like kind of seemed like a plot holding me, but I'm not complaining cause obviously like

02:55.280 --> 03:01.600
it's genius level TV. And he, one of the guys was like, you're trying to sell meth to my brother,

03:01.600 --> 03:06.720
my brother and me. But he kept doing, he kept referencing themselves like in that style. Oh,

03:06.720 --> 03:13.600
hold on. I'm checking Navy club right now. The review of the finale is in. I got it. It got an F.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.360
Probably because of that at the end when I just kind of zoomed like a really big zoom out and you

03:21.360 --> 03:29.120
realized it was just Griffin staring into a snow globe. Griffin's dream. It was little Griffin's

03:29.120 --> 03:34.800
dream the entire time. And the snow globe fell from his hand shattered grease, his hand greased

03:34.800 --> 03:40.400
with the grease of a thousand potato chips. And he of course said, oops, uh, I eat it all the

03:40.400 --> 03:47.280
potato chips. I dropped daddy's favorite snow globe. And the doctor said, it's so sad to see

03:47.280 --> 03:52.960
a 45 year old man reduced, reduced to this and they pulled out and it was another snow globe.

03:55.120 --> 04:00.880
And the snow globe, the snow globe was full of snow, obviously. And then in giant block letters,

04:00.880 --> 04:05.280
the word bad. And then when it fell to the floor and shattered, and then I looked at the camera and

04:05.280 --> 04:14.080
I said, get it created by events. Gilligan. I thought the polar bears were a nice touch though.

04:14.080 --> 04:20.880
Yeah. I don't know why Hurley was chosen to continue on the meth lab, but, um, so gosh,

04:20.880 --> 04:25.920
thank you to the new listeners who found our show, uh, through our, they're all gone. Sorry,

04:25.920 --> 04:32.720
juice. I I'm looking at the live cast stats right now. They all already left. There were 2.6 million

04:32.720 --> 04:40.000
people listening and they're all gone. They all left. Uh, so, but thank you. Thank you to, uh,

04:40.000 --> 04:47.040
those who left, uh, those download, you know, those numbers still spend, uh, and, uh, let's,

04:47.040 --> 04:52.400
let's do what we came here to do, which is help people. You know, I don't want to lose sight with

04:52.400 --> 04:58.960
our fame. Uh, I don't want to lose sight of that initial goal around 2 a.m. Every night. I'm

04:58.960 --> 05:05.280
awakened by a very loud cat fight. An outdoor neighbor cat enjoys coming by my bedroom window

05:05.280 --> 05:10.240
to antagonize my indoor cat. They hiss and meow and try to fight through the glass, making it

05:10.240 --> 05:14.720
impossible for me to sleep. Keeping the window closed and shades down doesn't help. What should

05:14.720 --> 05:20.880
I do? That's from cranky in Chicago. I think you should let them fight it out. Yeah. They got beef

05:20.880 --> 05:25.360
and who are you to try and try and squash it yourself? That's not how the animal kingdom

05:25.360 --> 05:28.720
works. It's like Justin and I used to fight a lot. And then my dad would be like, well,

05:28.720 --> 05:32.960
I'm just going to strap some boxing gloves to you guys and let you like do get out. And I'd

05:32.960 --> 05:37.840
be like, whoa, hold on. It's not that bad. So maybe it's just a lot of, uh, a lot of blunder,

05:37.840 --> 05:41.440
a lot of fuss. But when you actually say, Hey kitty, I'm gonna let you fight that other kitty.

05:42.160 --> 05:49.440
The way our dad escalated that, um, that strategy was that I thought a little irresponsible of him.

05:49.440 --> 05:55.280
Like I love our dad, but like once that strategy wore off, he like, he like pumped us full of

05:55.280 --> 05:59.120
mescal and, and like dropped us in the desert with, with swords. And he just like threw a

05:59.120 --> 06:03.680
knife down in the middle of us and said, you know, work it out. And then when he said, um,

06:05.760 --> 06:10.320
I'm going to strap knives to both your hands, he duct taped knives into our hands, both our hands.

06:10.320 --> 06:16.880
And he blindfolded us. I'm not coming back till one of you has taken one. I'm taking one son home.

06:16.880 --> 06:21.680
I'm taking one son home. I'm going to dip into my college fund that I saved for you guys.

06:21.680 --> 06:26.800
He didn't, but he's a great man. I love him. He did, uh, try to have us kill each other though,

06:26.800 --> 06:32.080
on several occasions, but you know, it made us closer. That's how Pokemon was invented

06:33.440 --> 06:40.800
by us fighting. Why is your cat in your room? I have a very strict policy when it comes to this.

06:40.800 --> 06:49.200
I have a closed door. I have a closed door policy for, for my cats at night. They have run up the

06:49.200 --> 06:55.040
entire house. There's one room that they cannot enter. And of course that bothers them. So they

06:55.040 --> 07:01.840
scratched. So now what I literally have is a closed door with a baby gate in front of it.

07:01.840 --> 07:08.400
They cannot even scratch. It is completely my territory, humans only a thank you.

07:08.400 --> 07:12.240
But sometimes when Justin wakes up too early, he'll find his two cats with like a rolled out

07:12.240 --> 07:17.200
blueprint staring at the door and then they're like, roll it up real quick. Meow. Meow. Meow.

07:17.200 --> 07:25.760
We're cats. Yeah. There's a Brad Pitt cat eating a sandwich. Um, I've been watching a lot of my cat

07:25.760 --> 07:32.720
from hell lately. Uh, it's on Netflix. You should Netflix it. Um, so like I Jackson galaxy has been

07:32.720 --> 07:38.240
like preparing me for this, for this question, my whole life, these past four days, Griffin,

07:38.240 --> 07:44.000
the way you, the way you talk about some programs, I'm just going to assume that one day you

07:44.000 --> 07:49.360
accidentally put it on animal planet and then through your remote into the sun, because that,

07:49.360 --> 07:54.000
that is the only explanation for the amount of terrible animal related television.

07:55.200 --> 07:59.520
This is you. This is you. Oh, my cat. I'm going to pet it. Pet it. Love it. Love it. Love it. I

07:59.520 --> 08:05.840
pet it and I love it. All right. Beat me. Why did it happen? That's you every day. This is me

08:05.840 --> 08:10.240
petting the cat. Oh, the cat's tail is switching. That must mean I put too much energy into it with

08:10.240 --> 08:15.680
my pets. It's all about how much it's all about managing the energy that you put into your cat.

08:15.680 --> 08:19.680
Cause if you overstimulate it, do you know what it's going to do? What it's going to bite you

08:19.680 --> 08:24.560
with his little teeth. Oh, like those little like a toy cars that you pull backwards to rev up. But

08:24.560 --> 08:28.560
if you pull them back too far, they start clicking and bite you. You got to rub those cheeks too.

08:28.560 --> 08:31.840
Cause that's where they get them pheromones out of. And then they like smelling that shit on your

08:31.840 --> 08:37.440
hands. Cause cats are nasty. That's like, that's true. So they smell their own funk on you and

08:37.440 --> 08:41.520
they're like, yeah, yeah. You my friend. Also, how do you know that your indoor cat isn't

08:41.520 --> 08:46.000
antagonizing the outdoor cat? Like what's up? I got a cool sitch in here. It's totally warm and

08:46.000 --> 08:51.120
I get food on the reg. I don't understand. Where do you, so where, like, where does the milk and,

08:51.120 --> 08:56.400
and, and kibble come from for you out there? Oh, you don't get that, huh? You're eating garbage.

08:56.400 --> 09:03.280
And you like that? Oh, cause you're poor. I bet you went to public school.

09:05.360 --> 09:12.960
Wait a minute. If one cat in a situation went to any schooling, I have to imagine that that's the,

09:12.960 --> 09:17.440
the privileged cat. Cause cats by and large, don't, don't get a lot of education. You didn't

09:17.440 --> 09:25.440
send your cat to private school? Yeah. Jackson Galaxy said 101. Have you even seen cat waiting

09:25.440 --> 09:31.440
for Superman? Like the public cat school system is fucked beyond repair. You got to get some vouchers

09:31.440 --> 09:38.880
for these goddamn cats. My cat is in fifth grade and learning algebra. Fifth grade. I, I sent my cat

09:38.880 --> 09:44.480
to a Montessori cat school. I think I learned as much from my cat as I do from tracks and galaxy,

09:44.480 --> 09:51.600
which is to say a lot. My cat's still in kit, kitten garden. Ah, done. God damn it. Kitten

09:51.600 --> 09:59.920
garden. Oh, okay. Do you guys want to Yahoo? Please. Anything. Um, this Yahoo was sent in by

09:59.920 --> 10:03.120
Jennifer Cheek. Thanks Jennifer. It's by Yahoo. Interest user. So who asks,

10:05.280 --> 10:14.720
I just ate some ricearoni that expired in 2004. Am I going to get sick? Yeah. Definitely realized

10:14.720 --> 10:20.320
this after I made it and ate some. It didn't have bugs or anything that I noticed. The box said

10:20.320 --> 10:25.440
best before, not expires, but I still feel like it's going to be bad for me to have eaten. Is

10:25.440 --> 10:30.640
anyone eaten old ricearoni before? And then there's a, there's an emoticon. It's like a frowny face

10:30.640 --> 10:36.000
with a bracket. So like, that's a piece of the rice. I think it's, I think it's, I think you're

10:36.000 --> 10:44.000
supposed to pronounce that. Oh God. Oh man. This is like my worst fear. We laugh at this person,

10:44.000 --> 10:49.280
but I think they're definitely dead. Oh, sorry. Okay. First off they're, they're dead. So let's

10:49.280 --> 10:55.040
not worry about helping them. I think that everybody has at least a few things, at least

10:55.040 --> 11:02.080
I know we do that are in the cupboard that I have no memory of purchasing. And if I do take it out

11:02.080 --> 11:10.640
to inspect as I have before the, the date is always like Clinton administration, like a mystery item.

11:10.640 --> 11:16.000
I would argue that I do not because I obsessively check dates on things.

11:16.000 --> 11:24.240
Because you obsessively eat. Because I have no food. We can't keep food in the house,

11:24.240 --> 11:28.400
but it's like, I understand having some old shit, you know, sometimes I go to the jungle

11:28.400 --> 11:32.000
gyms and I'm like, well, of course I want this weird package of figs. And you know,

11:32.000 --> 11:36.880
then I don't touch it cause it looks gross. At home it looks gross. It looks great.

11:39.280 --> 11:43.920
But then like I pull it out. I always look like, how do you pull out that box of rice,

11:43.920 --> 11:48.400
your onion go? I don't remember buying this. It's rice. It's uncooked rice. You don't think

11:48.400 --> 11:53.120
that shit goes bad. It's rice. Yeah. But there's gotta be a threshold that we're like,

11:53.120 --> 11:59.520
I don't think this went bad. But granted it was nine years ago. I think, I think that

11:59.520 --> 12:06.000
this has an infinite freshness. I think that the best before date is a recommendation in this case,

12:06.000 --> 12:11.200
or else they would have worded it a bit more strongly. There should be a best before date

12:11.200 --> 12:21.520
and a worst after date. It is best before 2004. It is worse after 2011. After 2011,

12:21.520 --> 12:27.280
it is the worst. It can't get any worse. The half-life will not reduce anymore at this point.

12:27.280 --> 12:32.640
This is what makes shelf-stable food so scary and why I try to keep as many of them in the

12:32.640 --> 12:36.880
house as possible because you can trust shelf-stable foods. They'll be there for you.

12:36.880 --> 12:42.640
Yeah. I do not have the same success rate with vegetables. There's no place in my home

12:43.200 --> 12:50.320
where the divide between aspiration and reality is more clear than walking from my produce drawer

12:50.320 --> 12:58.960
to my trash can. I actually this week threw away, and this is 100% true, I threw away a

12:58.960 --> 13:08.240
a biggest loser branded bag of celery unopened. I guess the celery was the biggest loser.

13:09.520 --> 13:13.760
I bought that in a store thinking, you know, that celery could not be more.

13:14.560 --> 13:19.040
There is zero hassle with that celery. It's just like potato chips. You pop open the bag,

13:19.040 --> 13:24.720
you eat celery. It is not hassle. That's why I love that in the fridge,

13:24.720 --> 13:30.000
it's like refrigerator designers went, let's make sure we hide these. I'll hide this. Nobody wants

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
to see this. We're going to put it on the bottom in a drawer by itself. So you never have to think

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
about the fact that you're not eating it. Justin, otherwise it's taunting you constantly. Did the

13:38.000 --> 13:42.880
bag have some sort of like hyper color label on it that as it expired, it slowly revealed a picture

13:42.880 --> 13:49.760
of bingo looking disappointed at you. Couldn't crack the bag, huh? I get it, man. Veggies be

13:49.760 --> 13:55.840
scary. Why are they green? You know what else is green? Monsters. You know what else is green?

13:55.840 --> 14:01.280
Godzilla. Bingo's terrified of Godzilla. Hates that motherfucker almost as much as he hates

14:01.280 --> 14:08.800
vegetables. Sneak him in the meat. This steak tastes weird. It's oozing green. Oh well, it's

14:08.800 --> 14:15.440
meat. Bingo's got to get big. The only vegetables he'll eat are pimentos that are hidden in head

14:15.440 --> 14:25.360
cheese. Fat fuck. I haven't seen bingo in a while. He may have slimmed down. Lost 80 pounds. Still

14:25.360 --> 14:32.800
big. And he's a little kid. How did he do it? Most kids are 80 pounds. Bingo lost a kid. And

14:32.800 --> 14:40.960
he's still, there's still a lot of bingo to just to admire. I don't know who you're referencing.

14:40.960 --> 14:48.080
Fucking, oh god, Google. Like how have you not Googled this kid yet? I don't know. You always

14:48.080 --> 14:52.320
talk about bingo for biggest loser and I don't know this person. I also, I don't want to Google

14:52.320 --> 14:55.840
it because I don't want to ruin the image in my head that you've created because I've got like a

14:55.840 --> 14:59.360
rich, rich fiction going on in my head. Let me tell you something. You're going to Google this

14:59.360 --> 15:05.440
kid and you're going to fuck it up because his name has two i's in it. Stupid. No, it doesn't

15:05.440 --> 15:11.120
really. Mm-hmm. Bingo was his name. Oh, but the song doesn't work. It doesn't work for this

15:11.120 --> 15:18.960
particular bingo. A big hello to my favorite trio of brothers. As you know, Halloween is coming up

15:18.960 --> 15:24.320
soon. I just had a major upheaval in my costume plan. I was going to be the cowardly lion in a

15:24.320 --> 15:31.440
group. My group disbanded and I'm left with no idea what to be. My hair is teal and medium length.

15:31.440 --> 15:36.800
If that helps. That's from Kaiser McMuffin. I think that when you do a big group thing,

15:37.600 --> 15:43.920
one, it works if everybody is on the same level of like commitment and goodness as everybody else.

15:43.920 --> 15:48.320
It doesn't work alone. Like one person spent like $150 on a costume and worked on it for like days

15:48.320 --> 15:52.240
and days and days. And the other person just like reaches into their closet and throws it on.

15:52.240 --> 15:56.400
But it also doesn't work when you're at the party and you all separate to go do other things.

15:56.400 --> 16:02.240
Yeah, but then you're just a fucking lion. Like you're a lion. That's good enough. That's fine.

16:02.240 --> 16:05.920
That's fine. You did it. You did a costume.

16:05.920 --> 16:09.120
I mean, great. But imagine like you're doing the dudes from Reservoir Dogs,

16:09.120 --> 16:12.560
right? And like your other dudes leave you and then you're just a guy in a black suit.

16:13.680 --> 16:17.280
What about if he goes peanut butter and jelly and then your partner leaves you and suddenly

16:17.280 --> 16:23.440
you're just toast? Why is jelly crying? Jelly looks so sad. I guess peanut butter just wasn't

16:23.440 --> 16:33.920
ready for it. Oh, God. I love that. Travis liked it. I did. It's a thinker is what it is. I got a

16:33.920 --> 16:40.160
mullet. You could go as a mullet. That would be a tough costume to pull off.

16:40.160 --> 16:44.880
I'm giving up on Halloween. I think I'm pretty much done with it.

16:46.640 --> 16:49.520
Because for two years running, I put a lot of work into a costume.

16:49.520 --> 16:54.720
As first as a contestant on Legends of the Hidden Temple, people would be like,

16:54.720 --> 17:00.640
oh, you're a biker because of your helmet. Like, oh, you fuck. These are obviously barracudas.

17:00.640 --> 17:05.280
Anyway, last year I was homeless Elmo because Mitt Romney wanted to shut down Sesame Street.

17:05.280 --> 17:10.800
It was political. It was fucking nobody. Nobody understood my art. Nobody understood my craftwork.

17:11.840 --> 17:17.920
Last year I did Marty McFly and I built a fucking hoverboard and put a little

17:17.920 --> 17:25.200
bit of work into it. The first dude I saw when I walked in to the party was like, oh, what are you?

17:27.600 --> 17:33.120
I was like, I've got a hoverboard. He's like, I'm Marty McFly from Back to the Future. He's like,

17:33.120 --> 17:39.040
oh, I've never seen it. You fucking stress out about it all month and then you spend like $45

17:40.080 --> 17:44.320
acquiring the goods and nobody knows who or what the fuck you are.

17:44.320 --> 17:49.680
I also feel like I could see Halloween being totally worth it if over the weekend, like the

17:49.680 --> 17:55.360
28th, 29th, 30th, 31st, you went to like four separate parties and got four different days of

17:55.360 --> 18:00.960
like rocking this costume you spent like $50 to $60 on. But otherwise you're going to one party for

18:00.960 --> 18:07.040
like four hours and you get that initial like, oh, awesome. Yeah, that doesn't sound so bad.

18:07.600 --> 18:11.520
Who doesn't want a chance to just get outside themselves for a night, you know?

18:11.520 --> 18:16.880
Well, I love myself though. What if I just went as like me on my best day?

18:17.840 --> 18:22.000
Is that a good Halloween costume? Me just living it.

18:23.120 --> 18:31.600
Actually, our friend Mike Murdock, one year recently, he was in his mid 30s at the time

18:31.600 --> 18:36.960
and he went as himself from when he was happy in his mid 20s.

18:36.960 --> 18:43.440
And he acted like he did when he was happy before he was miserable.

18:43.440 --> 18:47.120
It's like, just do that every day. Can you go as America's Next Top Model 2.0,

18:47.120 --> 18:48.320
boys in the house? Boys in the house.

18:48.320 --> 18:50.480
Boys in the house. Boys in the house.

18:51.840 --> 18:56.160
There is nothing more to say about this that will be funny.

18:56.880 --> 18:59.760
I don't think anything has been said about it that was funny.

18:59.760 --> 19:06.160
I mean, either. Okay, let me rephrase that. There's nothing on earth to say about this as funny

19:06.160 --> 19:08.320
because if there were, we would have discovered it.

19:08.320 --> 19:14.000
I love it. I love everything about fall. I love cider. I love pumpkin spice lattes.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.480
I love pumpkin spice waffles. Spice anything with some fucking pumpkins and I'll eat it.

19:18.480 --> 19:26.960
I love crisp leaves. I love carving things. I fucking hate like October 1st is Tuesday

19:26.960 --> 19:30.480
and I'm gonna have to start like cranking the gears. I gotta kick it in the high gear.

19:31.520 --> 19:34.080
Can we all agree that like Halloween is dead?

19:34.080 --> 19:34.240
It's dead.

19:34.240 --> 19:38.000
Halloween is, what are you talking? Halloween is, the older I get,

19:38.000 --> 19:44.640
the more I enjoy Halloween over Christmas and that is a set. You guys wait till you're 30.

19:44.640 --> 19:53.760
Here's the thing though. If I could attend a Halloween party where it was like a macabre

19:53.760 --> 19:57.600
kind of like gothic thing where everybody was just like dressed in black and like suits but

19:57.600 --> 20:02.640
like really nice like classy outfits but just the difference was it was orange and black,

20:02.640 --> 20:07.040
that would be dope. It's when you show up to a Halloween party and like really let's be honest,

20:07.040 --> 20:10.720
three quarters of the people are wearing a t-shirt with something they've drawn on a piece

20:10.720 --> 20:14.560
of paper safety pin to it and they're like do you get it? I'm a bottle of ketchup and it's like no,

20:14.560 --> 20:18.960
you're wearing a red t-shirt with ketchup written on a piece of paper. It's like this is sad. Like

20:18.960 --> 20:23.920
this is a bad party. Like let's just be adults and get drunk with a purpose.

20:23.920 --> 20:29.920
I want my Halloween to be a Dawson's Creek Halloween special. I want the fucking thing

20:29.920 --> 20:34.320
to go right off the rails. I want to go to a haunted house where maybe there's an actual

20:34.320 --> 20:40.480
fucking ghost up in there. I want to maybe solve a mystery and then at the end everyone gets

20:40.480 --> 20:46.240
murdered and then the next episode nobody got murdered. I think you've skewed into Boy Meets

20:46.240 --> 20:52.560
World. I just want to be spooked I guess. I haven't been spooked in a real long time.

20:53.120 --> 20:59.120
Why don't you come to West Virginia. We'll go to the West End Asylum. It's the largest

20:59.120 --> 21:03.200
freestanding stone structure in America. Second largest in the world after the Kremlin. Used to

21:03.200 --> 21:09.840
be filled with poorly treated insane people and go on a tour. They'll let you sleep there at night.

21:09.840 --> 21:14.000
It's crazy. That doesn't sound like something I would be into. That sounds too spooky. I want to

21:14.000 --> 21:19.040
split the difference. Split the spook difference. Yeah. Does anybody remember what I was for

21:19.040 --> 21:23.520
Halloween last year? I can't remember. You and Sydney had a couple's costume didn't you?

21:23.520 --> 21:30.400
We usually do but. You were the Doctor Who. And that was two years ago. What year did you go as

21:30.400 --> 21:40.720
Lowell and Antonio Scarpacci from Wings? I went as Lowell and Thomas Hayden Church from Sideways.

21:41.920 --> 21:47.840
How about Yahoo? Yeah teach me to laugh again. This Yahoo is also sent in by Jennifer Chee.

21:47.840 --> 21:54.400
Thanks Jennifer. But Yahoo answers user Daniel who asks first day at Little Caesars. Today is

21:54.400 --> 21:58.720
my first day at Little Caesars and I'm pretty nervous. I knew no one there at the orientation.

22:02.080 --> 22:07.760
Yeah Little Caesars class of 2013. Plus I don't know how to punch in.

22:10.480 --> 22:15.120
Also they only showed us how to make one kind of pizza at the orientation. How will we all know

22:15.120 --> 22:20.400
what to make if we didn't get very much training? The store opened like a week ago. When I get there

22:20.400 --> 22:24.800
should I just ask my boss how to do so and what to do? I don't want to look like I need constant

22:24.800 --> 22:33.760
help. Additional details. I don't want to seem needy. Man fucking Little Caesars apparently has

22:33.760 --> 22:40.240
like a drunk dad at the public pool method of teaching their employees. The one kind of pizza

22:40.240 --> 22:45.680
you have to learn is the five dollar hot and ready pepperoni oven that no one else is coming

22:45.680 --> 22:49.920
and going. You know what I want? That really complicated expensive pizza. Everybody rolls up

22:49.920 --> 22:57.600
two o'clock in the morning gets himself 18 hot and ready and sits in their car. Nobody's coming

22:57.600 --> 23:04.320
into Little Caesars to ask for the chickpea and chevrola pizza. It's not happening. Can I get the

23:04.320 --> 23:13.440
goat cheese and spinach artisanal pizza? Is your shiitake local? Local grown? We got boomperonis.

23:13.440 --> 23:21.120
Can I have your corn-fed shiitake? Is your crust organic? I have a problem with I mean it might

23:21.120 --> 23:25.760
seem that Little Caesars is being irresponsible but I have a question for this gentleman.

23:25.760 --> 23:33.040
Why did you apply for a job as a pizza maker if you do not know how to make pizzas? That seems

23:33.040 --> 23:39.520
like a very of a large ethical piece. Justin let me throw you a different question. Where

23:39.520 --> 23:45.040
other than Little Caesars do you think is the base entry level position as a pizza maker?

23:45.040 --> 23:49.040
What do you think you're saying? I need to go to pizza school first before I can. You're also

23:50.640 --> 23:55.280
assuming that like they show up to Little Caesars on the first day like so how'd you get into Little

23:55.280 --> 23:58.960
Caesars? Like I've been making my own pizzas at home for such a long time and just I found the

23:58.960 --> 24:04.800
prospects so rewarding I thought hey I could probably make a career out of this no. I'm going

24:04.800 --> 24:12.080
pro. I also found out this week by talking to uh the the young man playing Superman in the musical

24:12.080 --> 24:17.920
I'm directing he works at Little Caesars actually and he was telling me that his his role in the

24:17.920 --> 24:24.080
process is he takes the pizza out of the oven and he cuts the pizza and he tries not to burn himself

24:24.080 --> 24:28.720
and sometimes he does not do the last one so well and he does burn himself on occasion but

24:29.280 --> 24:35.280
maybe because the Little Caesars process is so specialized no one needs to holistically know how

24:35.280 --> 24:42.080
to make a pizza. You mean you just need to know how your your part in the assembly process. They

24:42.080 --> 24:47.120
by specialized you mean they have mastered the craft of shoving a pizza inside of a cannon

24:47.600 --> 24:52.880
and then firing it through a superheated oven directly into your mouth. Right.

24:52.880 --> 24:59.520
Right. No. Yes. This carnival ride costs you five dollars. I believe it was Henry Ford who said the

24:59.520 --> 25:05.040
beauty of the assembly line is that no one needs to know shit about making pizza and we only have

25:05.040 --> 25:11.920
to charge five dollars. Five goddamn dollars for it instantly. Instantly. It's hot and ready. It's

25:11.920 --> 25:17.920
not hot and not ready. It's not cold and ready. It's hot and ready. Uh I have to actually disagree

25:17.920 --> 25:23.520
with the hot part. I don't think I've eaten a hot Little Caesars pizza in a while. I think at my

25:23.520 --> 25:29.600
local Little Caesars pizza I think that they have some sort of robot that makes 500 pizzas at 9 am

25:29.600 --> 25:35.920
as soon as they open and then they just like they just shuffle up and deal. There was a uh a limited

25:35.920 --> 25:42.160
time you could get they had a pretzel crust pizza at Little Caesars in the hot and ready and I

25:42.160 --> 25:50.000
actually showed up for one so early that they had not prepared them yet. They were not ready

25:50.560 --> 25:56.000
for me because it was like 11 in the morning and I was buying an entire pizza. Hey how's your day?

25:56.000 --> 26:02.400
How's your day? It's going pretty bad uh if I remember correctly so I thought I'd cheer myself

26:02.400 --> 26:06.480
up but you know what if you're cheering yourself up at 11 with pizza all you're really doing is

26:06.480 --> 26:11.280
buying yourself a bad rest of your day. If you do that you have to roll up in scrubs covered in

26:11.280 --> 26:18.080
blood and say like I had the worst night shift of my life and all I need is pizza. I just want one

26:18.080 --> 26:23.120
zombie. You know when you're holding the child in your hands and it breathes its last breath you

26:23.120 --> 26:27.120
think well that hot and ready later it's gonna make it back. No but I'm glad that you hadn't

26:27.120 --> 26:31.920
started making the pizzas. Man I'm gonna need to have eaten an entire pizza in 11 minutes.

26:33.840 --> 26:37.600
But no how was your important pizza making job that you couldn't get started yet?

26:37.600 --> 26:42.640
Uh if we're gonna continue to buy hot and readies every day we're gonna need some money.

26:42.640 --> 26:46.720
And not much not a lot of money. Not a lot of money. One of these spots and we'll be good to

26:46.720 --> 26:48.000
coast on for like two months.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.920
I want to tell you guys about a book. You go to amazon.com here's how you get the book. You type

27:01.920 --> 27:08.880
in 50 ways to say you're awesome and then there will be a book there. Just click the buy button.

27:08.880 --> 27:15.200
Don't think about it. Buy it. What's it about? Doesn't matter. I'm in charge here. Get out get

27:15.200 --> 27:23.520
in the passenger seat. Miss Daisy I'm driving you to a book about laughs and also uh it has pages.

27:24.400 --> 27:29.760
Can I get it at a store like a local bookstore or do I have to amazon? You don't why do you have

27:29.760 --> 27:35.200
to get snooty about it? It doesn't have to be a locally sourced artisanal copy of 50 ways to say

27:35.200 --> 27:41.920
you're awesome. I'm sorry is this paper gluten free? I only read corn fed books. Um also like

27:41.920 --> 27:44.960
why the fuck are you gonna buy a book without being able to show it to other people while

27:44.960 --> 27:49.920
you're buying it to impress them? Good point. Amazon doesn't commend me. I'm like oh griffin

27:49.920 --> 27:55.600
you just bought a 250 page book. That's gonna be very are you gonna read all of that you big man?

27:55.600 --> 28:01.440
Cerebrally rewarding. The book is 50 ways to say you're awesome. It's a collection of love notes

28:01.440 --> 28:06.640
and thank you notes for the modern era which they think they're being cute by putting that in their

28:06.640 --> 28:13.600
ad text but uh you'll be speaking from my lawyer you'll hear from him. You'll be seeing from his

28:13.600 --> 28:21.840
mouth because you're a ventriloquist. You'll be feeling from my lawyer. You'll be sad because of

28:21.840 --> 28:31.200
my lawyer's stuff to you. Call PJ Johnson and Johnson we'll make him sad for you with the stuff

28:31.200 --> 28:39.840
we do. We're good time lawyers yes sir. We are great great lawyers with law degrees and everything

28:39.840 --> 28:46.480
we're gonna do stuff you're gonna have money they won't and they'll be so sad about it. Top notch

28:46.480 --> 28:56.400
lawyering okay. Get ready for a feeling coming from law legal. All the legal feelings legal to

28:56.400 --> 29:03.600
feel. Book it. Book them Dano now we're suing ourselves. Feel that? That's irony.

29:06.160 --> 29:14.320
Irony that pays you. Car accident, puddle accident, slip and fall accident, bathroom accident,

29:14.320 --> 29:21.920
hot pocket burns, burns on your mouth from a hot pocket. We'll do it. We got this I think.

29:23.680 --> 29:35.120
Torts, torts and gavels. Let's make fun of tabloids not the celebrities although the fake ones

29:35.120 --> 29:41.120
probably deserve it but let's make fun of gossip magazines the business itself. Us Weekly Digest

29:41.120 --> 29:48.320
is a short funny video every week where one man tries to make sense of why these rags do what they

29:48.320 --> 29:54.720
do. It sounds insane and it's on YouTube which is a video streaming hosting. I'm sorry which one's

29:54.720 --> 30:02.240
YouTube Justin? It's a video streamer hoster. It's not US Weekly Digest it's Us Weekly Digest

30:02.240 --> 30:07.680
but I think either one's gonna get the job done just type US and then Weekly Digest into YouTube

30:07.680 --> 30:12.000
next to the magnifying glass and you're gonna see these uh videos and you're gonna laugh at them.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.880
Hey what do you guys think about this? YouPube.

30:17.920 --> 30:24.080
I don't even I don't even hear the rest. Travis liked it. Dear Shark Tank, here's the idea.

30:24.080 --> 30:30.640
YouPube. Get Foxworthy's in. You're asking for four hundred thousand dollars for a two percent

30:30.640 --> 30:35.280
stake in YouPube. That means you evaluate your company. Let me do the math. Twenty billion

30:35.280 --> 30:44.240
dollars. Yep. Uh excuse me everyone. I have an announcement to make. YouPube redirects to DirecTV.

30:48.240 --> 30:53.360
That's my official announcement. Breaking news. YouPube.com

30:55.360 --> 31:00.640
redirects to DirecTV. You know guys I am looking at my keyboard the p and t keys are wicked far

31:00.640 --> 31:05.520
away from each other. This has to be they have made a concerted effort to stake their claim.

31:05.520 --> 31:10.000
If I can draw your attention to the pie chart as you can see 63 percent of our business comes from

31:10.000 --> 31:16.880
people being redirected from YouPube and going hey that is a good deal. Uh do you guys know about

31:16.880 --> 31:23.600
Wise Guys? I do but I want you to tell me about it. They're they uh they're they're game dudes.

31:23.600 --> 31:31.440
They're Miles and Greg. They design challenges for Survivor on CBS. But I've always wondered

31:31.440 --> 31:37.840
who makes those fucking games. Those these guys are doing it and they're uh right now

31:37.840 --> 31:43.440
I've actually met them. They they had a game at E3 once that I I played. It was the one Griffin

31:43.440 --> 31:46.320
do you remember the one where everybody wore trench coats and they had napkins in their pocket

31:46.320 --> 31:52.080
and they stole the stuff? No. It was great and it was a real game but they made up but they make

31:52.080 --> 31:56.240
games they have games for Survivor. They've showcased games 83 and they're kick starting a

31:56.240 --> 32:01.680
game for downtown Los Angeles that will be hidden in plain sight for anyone to find and play for

32:01.680 --> 32:09.120
free. It's uh so dope. It's a noir and players sleuth out clues concerning a stolen artifact

32:09.120 --> 32:12.480
and a missing detective. You interact with characters and artifacts some real and some

32:12.480 --> 32:20.400
virtual while visiting actual locations uh around LA. Um that sounds amazing. It also sounds like

32:20.400 --> 32:26.320
I want that. It sounds like I could get real thorny real quick. Wiseguisevents.com go there

32:26.880 --> 32:34.400
and uh kick on their uh click on their Kickstarter. Kick on their starter baby. Click that starter.

32:34.400 --> 32:39.520
Kickstart my heart. Don't you never stop. I need I I really desperately need this to get

32:39.520 --> 32:45.440
kickstarted so that I can do it. Yeah we need this to exist. So you're not afraid of being like

32:45.440 --> 32:53.200
I swear I saw a clue in the LA river. Oh nope it's a real body. I feel very sick. Is this a clue?

32:53.200 --> 32:56.640
Nope. No you have hepatitis. It's clue it's Clumidia. Doctor.

32:59.600 --> 33:03.840
Now that if you go right now to the website uh you're not going to find a Kickstarter link.

33:03.840 --> 33:09.440
That's going to go live tomorrow. Maybe we spoiled it by telling you about it now but you got to

33:09.440 --> 33:16.320
remember. Set a reminder on your iPhone. Siri remind me. Clue me in. Clue me in Siri. Tomorrow.

33:17.280 --> 33:22.640
We're kick we're kick kick starting. We're kickstart start kicking. And just just so there's

33:22.640 --> 33:26.560
no confusion when we say tomorrow we mean October 1st. So maybe you'll listen to this like three

33:26.560 --> 33:35.120
weeks from now and just lose your mind. October 1st. Uh listen guys you've probably tried hulu.com.

33:35.120 --> 33:39.680
You know you you want to stream a tv show but you know you're not getting the optimal experience

33:39.680 --> 33:45.600
right? I mean it's fine hulu.com is fine but there's kind of a vip lounge just to the left.

33:45.600 --> 33:51.600
If you look to your left you'll see hulu. Do you mean pu blue? Nope. Lefter. More left. No.

33:51.600 --> 33:54.960
Hulu.gov? No. Bye sponsors. Well we had a good one.

33:57.120 --> 34:02.080
Some feedback. One thing uh that we didn't really enjoy about the spot. Can you not put pube in it?

34:02.080 --> 34:07.920

35:30.960 --> 35:36.400
at little caesar's on when they get high on their own there is no overhead on a hot night

35:36.400 --> 35:41.040
because there is no mark high margins on the hot and ready pizza they can they can afford to take

35:41.040 --> 35:46.240
a bath on those listen we're making 4.95 off of every five dollars hot and ready so you can have

35:46.240 --> 35:50.800
it for like a quarter can i get one of those day old hot and ready so they're just sitting in the

35:50.800 --> 35:57.680
back yeah it's uh five dollars what um they actually have to eat the pizzas once they're

35:57.680 --> 36:06.480
no longer ready or hot this is cold and old we got a cold and old for the employees you guys have

36:06.480 --> 36:14.880
to eat it otherwise they'll just fill up the universe the staff at little caesar's is our

36:14.880 --> 36:19.280
first line of defense actually that's the plot of wall-e they stopped eating the the hot and

36:19.280 --> 36:24.960
readies and they ran out of room also wall-e is wall-e is a totally tubular dinosaur this is the

36:24.960 --> 36:30.000
version of wall-e that was made in the 80s it was a dinosaur that transformed into a sports car when

36:30.000 --> 36:34.480
he ate too much pizza everybody had to fly off in space so they got fat enough to consume the rest

36:34.480 --> 36:37.760
of the pizzas that were left and then they could come back because they would have room in their

36:37.760 --> 36:43.200
tum-tums to store all the hot and ready switched by this point we're cold and oldies the original

36:43.200 --> 36:50.160
title of the film was the land before time but after pizza all of our clocks are pizza now

36:53.440 --> 36:59.920
hey folks this is kevin allison of the max fun podcast risk where people tell true stories they

36:59.920 --> 37:06.320

37:06.320 --> 37:12.400
it's an all-star lineup of jaw-dropping true stories from aisha tyler this being the 90s

37:12.400 --> 37:17.040
i was drinking malt liquor don't fuck you when you're racist you're all racist for laughing

37:18.240 --> 37:23.920
tom lennon whenever i walk into a place that's called mr binky's i'm expecting armenian bumblebee

37:23.920 --> 37:30.400
to be like i got jackoff pills for you yeah jay moore me public school in new jersey i didn't

37:30.400 --> 37:34.000
need to know anything because everybody knew you got pregnant by peeing in each other's butts that's

37:34.000 --> 37:42.880
how we knew andy dick we've had a monogamous relationship for five years i barely cheated on her

37:42.880 --> 37:48.880
and the daily shows jessica williams oh my god i have like this need to be responsible for some

37:48.880 --> 37:55.520
reason that doesn't really benefit me so like jessica clean it up look for risk on itunes or

37:55.520 --> 38:04.160
of course at maximum fun dot org hey brothers i live in kentucky and when i talk to people outside

38:04.160 --> 38:08.320
the state and mention where i'm from they often assume i live with a bunch of rednecks or that i

38:08.320 --> 38:15.520
eat kfc all the time at first i played along with their jokes and took it in stride but after a while

38:15.520 --> 38:19.040
these false assumptions started to bother me and i started feeling that i should take pride in my

38:19.040 --> 38:23.440
state and try to dispel their negative stereotypes should i just let it go when it comes up in

38:23.440 --> 38:28.480
conversation or should i tell them that kentucky is more than just kfc bourbon hicks and horses

38:28.480 --> 38:34.480
and that's from one cantankerous kentuckian why don't you tell those people fuck off yeah that's

38:34.480 --> 38:38.160
not talking to people from outside your state no it's on the fuck off like what if they are what

38:38.160 --> 38:42.640
so what if the state's full of rednecks and people eat kfc like and horses and bourbon like all that

38:42.640 --> 38:48.320
shit rules yeah that sounds pretty sweet actually that sounds actually it sounds like a paradise

38:48.320 --> 38:54.480
state actually what you've just described um yeah you from west virginia i totally relate yeah i

38:54.480 --> 38:59.600
think we all relate but like people like yeah all i bet you're all just a bunch of backwoods

39:00.240 --> 39:06.240
just just people doing stunts on atvs like yep that's that that would be totally cool if true

39:06.240 --> 39:11.360
like you guys drink a lot of moonshine and play banjos like yeah both of those fucking are awesome

39:11.360 --> 39:17.520
like what's the big deal with you i i like to challenge people like that i ask them when oh uh

39:17.520 --> 39:22.400
you know when the last time they visited was and the answer is always never and then they look

39:22.400 --> 39:28.640
silly like silly gooses when i went to school in oklahoma the number of people from like oh and i

39:28.640 --> 39:32.240
say this with all the love in the world people from oklahoma who are like i bet you guys don't

39:32.240 --> 39:36.480
wear shoes and it's like listen oklahoma i know you're a wonderful state but where do you get off

39:36.480 --> 39:40.240
well west virginia see that too and i moved to texas like people like you roping steers down

39:40.240 --> 39:46.720
there like really bro but yes yes definitely i mean i am but i'd rather not discuss it in

39:46.720 --> 39:53.120
such a derogatory way here's the secret everybody come real close no matter where you live it's all

39:53.120 --> 39:59.360
the same everything is the same it all got bought by corporations every city's the exact same and

39:59.360 --> 40:05.280
it's owned by starbucks and the illuminati and just move on every city's the same it's all the

40:05.280 --> 40:11.040
same got bought got bought by corporations i don't think that's true it's no place has any identity

40:11.040 --> 40:18.720
anymore oklahoma is like new york stretched out new york is like huntington west it's like big

40:18.720 --> 40:24.800
flat new york take one block in in queens and just sort of just sort of smush it to the size of a

40:24.800 --> 40:30.640
state new york is one huntington repeated endless times and squooshed together that's what always

40:30.640 --> 40:35.200
killed me like i'd come back to visit from college and people would be like so how's oklahoma it's

40:35.200 --> 40:41.600
like exactly the same as here but flatter i mean like unless you live in new york city which yes is

40:41.600 --> 40:48.400
on well i mean basically new york city is like big chicago but or like la i call it double chicago

40:48.400 --> 40:55.360
double chicago chicago squared like unless you live in like one of those places or orlando every

40:55.360 --> 41:00.800
other city in america is the same city well orlando gets a pass because they have uh more

41:00.800 --> 41:06.320
uh amusement parks per capita yeah uh than the rest of the country put together that's different

41:06.320 --> 41:11.520
you know when people ask me how austin is i usually respond like you can get fried avocado

41:11.520 --> 41:16.480
tacos like pretty much anywhere that is literally like the defining characteristic of this of this

41:16.480 --> 41:20.400
city and state for me that i think people are like how's cincinnati i'm like well it's right

41:20.400 --> 41:28.000
on a river so we have a thriving trade he just basically recites the wikipedia page our main

41:28.000 --> 41:34.240
exports and imports are i almost hit a dude in with my shopping cart yesterday at walmart

41:35.520 --> 41:39.200
i was buying ingredients to bake a tart to tan today that's going to happen too

41:39.200 --> 41:43.920
but everybody can come over and have some if they want uh got some more that's my favorite that's

41:43.920 --> 41:51.840
my favorite musketeer uh uh but i almost hit this dude with my cart and he smiled and said sorry

41:52.640 --> 41:56.480
because that's west virginia people here are great and you wouldn't know anything about it

41:56.480 --> 42:02.400
if you weren't here yes it's impoverished like a lot of areas here's here's a surprise for you uh

42:03.360 --> 42:09.040
most places that have these kinds of reputations aren't impoverished because they love they love

42:09.040 --> 42:15.120
going out back and not having anything there they don't love going to bed hungry because it's like

42:15.120 --> 42:22.320
their fucking identity they're poor because you corporations bought everything stole our

42:22.320 --> 42:29.600
resources so yes i i mean i understand that why why these stereotypes about reasons are handy

42:29.600 --> 42:35.760
because your brain can't hold all the truth so the brain has to hold convenient lies like when i

42:35.760 --> 42:42.320
think about orlando that i i mean it literally might as well be a road straight to that big

42:42.880 --> 42:47.920
globe in epcot there's a name for that you know that weird dome anyway spaceship earth

42:47.920 --> 42:54.720
spaceship earth what's up so you can i mean i watch a lot of behind the scenes uh documentaries

42:54.720 --> 43:01.600
from uh from disney world so that's my life i watched a lot of battlefield earth so that's sort

43:01.600 --> 43:06.080
of like what i'm into yeah like if you don't travel a lot you just fucking make up these

43:06.080 --> 43:12.880
assumptions you just assume you assume the the funniest about a state and yeah i don't know it's

43:12.880 --> 43:17.200
no one's gonna say like i bet you have like a middle in commerce and i bet you rely heavily

43:17.200 --> 43:22.880
on tourism but most of your money is actually made by coal am i right like yeah that is actually

43:22.880 --> 43:29.040
pretty close you nailed it got it i bet you have average rainfall and a pretty uh common uh lowest

43:29.040 --> 43:40.320
point of the state i bet your pollen count from your deciduous forest i didn't know i didn't know

43:40.320 --> 43:47.920
any smart things to say i just said smart sounding words and then kind of i bet you

43:47.920 --> 43:52.560
i bet your tributaries to uh your biggest the water table

43:56.400 --> 43:58.080
i bet your geology is

44:00.400 --> 44:06.560
slate and shale do you guys want to yeah sure this yahoo was sent in by julie ken thank you

44:06.560 --> 44:14.640
julie it's by yahoo answers user woe is me who asks things you would like to tell non-horse people

44:14.640 --> 44:22.080
and then there's an enumerated list uh i'm ready some of them are just like gibberish

44:22.640 --> 44:26.880
uh just because he's a paint doesn't mean his name is patch i think maybe she meant pinto

44:27.520 --> 44:32.960
no paint is that a type of horse yes it is it's those uh horses that have look like they have

44:32.960 --> 44:39.920
splotches oh okay um no he's not being silly he's pissed off because you're acting like a retard

44:39.920 --> 44:46.800
all right great wow wow cool i'm glad you're focused on horse sensitivity right now we'll

44:46.800 --> 44:52.000
we'll circle back around to human sensitivity uh not his pony won't grow to be a horse didn't mean

44:52.000 --> 44:58.480
anything uh i stepped in horse poop and i don't care it's gonna smell like horse it's a barn

44:58.480 --> 45:03.440
i guess this is if you're in a barn with these people go complain somewhere else and then in

45:03.440 --> 45:10.080
parentheses animal activists at local fairs what do you want to tell these really specific problem

45:10.080 --> 45:16.640
what do you want to tell these people who don't know about horses you're a horse person listen

45:16.640 --> 45:21.680
we're all horse people here this is a saviour horse zone uh what do you say to non-horse people

45:21.680 --> 45:27.440
people who are cool about horses don't offer him that he quit smoking three years ago okay

45:27.440 --> 45:33.040
it seems like a pretty specific scenario i mean i'm just taking people off from my horse smokes yeah

45:34.480 --> 45:39.920
um there's a lot of answers on this which is why i think oh of course there are

45:40.960 --> 45:45.040
um people love to talk there's one thing that people horse people love more than anything

45:45.840 --> 45:51.120
more than uh breaking the spirit of a beautiful animal so they can ride it around town like

45:51.120 --> 45:56.960
the mayor of fancy land but they the other thing they love is judging people who don't have horse

45:56.960 --> 46:03.120
fever as as though as though the uh the thing keeping me from horse isn't the economic barrier

46:03.120 --> 46:10.640
it's just my distaste for for quadrupedal beings um when yahoo answers users said very

46:10.640 --> 46:16.560
interesting question with a lot of good answers fun reading had a good time

46:19.120 --> 46:22.720
i like people that aren't there to provide an answer they just want to

46:22.720 --> 46:28.880
uh comment on how things are going i like the work you're doing asking the tough questions um

46:28.880 --> 46:34.480
here's some more answers yes my horses just eat hay that is what keeps them warm in the winter not

46:34.480 --> 46:40.800
grain so like i guess in this situation quit asking hey i bet your horse keeps warm from grain

46:40.800 --> 46:47.600
like no dog don't talk don't run your fucking mouth in here man you have no fucking idea what

46:47.600 --> 46:53.360
you're talking about take your grain agenda right out the door no which is over there and it opens

46:53.360 --> 46:58.800
in the middle because we gotta get horses through uh no my particular horses don't need shoes if

46:58.800 --> 47:05.280
that changes i'll look into it should put some shoes on that hey why don't you fuck right off

47:05.920 --> 47:12.080
you're not his horse parent i just i just listened to the stuff you should know horseshoes episode

47:12.080 --> 47:17.040
how horseshoes work and i'm almost positive that if you do not put shoes on your horse

47:17.040 --> 47:21.440
their feet hurt real bad travis that's where those attitudes come from now you're gonna get

47:21.440 --> 47:27.920
hate mail you don't know who what this person's fucking situation is and you're talking shit no

47:27.920 --> 47:33.600
i don't blanket my horses in the winter they grow a thick fur coat and do just fine god damn it dad

47:34.960 --> 47:42.080
you gotta trust me you gotta show a little faith we're never gonna make it through this if you

47:42.080 --> 47:47.200
don't trust me this is what's wrong with america we don't teach people at little caesar's how to

47:47.200 --> 47:52.800
make pizza but we expect people who don't own horses to understand the intricacies of maintaining

47:52.800 --> 47:57.280
them this person these all these answers have come from the same person and the wheels kind

47:57.280 --> 48:02.160
of fall off the wagon here yes i have three horses on four acres they have lots to eat

48:02.160 --> 48:07.280
and their pastures will manage so don't tell me the law says they need x number of acres per

48:07.280 --> 48:12.720
hour i think that might actually be like a law legal law i think that might i think we might

48:12.720 --> 48:20.160
need to call our law experts to do some stuff have your horses got a tummy hunger grass on down

48:20.160 --> 48:27.360
you got horses we've got answers we'll sell you our grass no i'm not a horse expert that is why

48:27.360 --> 48:32.160
i have a vet and a farrier i trust and ask lots of questions not knowing every single thing there

48:32.160 --> 48:37.200
is to know in the world of horses does not make me a moron or disqualify me from owning one this

48:37.200 --> 48:42.080
now sounds like a person who is a horse person that is defending themselves from other horse

48:42.080 --> 48:47.840
people who are better horses yeah eight of my horses died under mysterious circumstances also

48:47.840 --> 48:52.400
if you're trusting fairies for horse advice you you should probably hang it up right there

48:53.120 --> 48:58.320
no a farrier a person who drives fairies wait a minute why is the person who drives fairies

48:58.320 --> 49:02.320
knowledgeable about horses because they use the ferry to get the horse across the river

49:02.320 --> 49:09.040
oh no read a goddamn book justin i'm not doing this again get no he's gonna have to take the

49:09.040 --> 49:13.680
bridge like everybody else i'm not putting another horse on my ferry why does that tell

49:13.680 --> 49:18.480
you some things about horses why does that horse look so sad he looks like he was beaten um maybe

49:18.480 --> 49:26.240
because he has a long face literally hey hey whoa okay so that's just you're just telling

49:26.240 --> 49:32.960
a really bad horse joke at this point he he ran into a horse door so what if he walks into a bar

49:34.000 --> 49:40.400
and then why are you so tired all you did was horse riding yeah you wish that's all i was doing

49:42.720 --> 49:50.160
i had a busy day before i got on the horse i went to the bank i paid some bills i bought a saddle

49:51.040 --> 49:55.920
men cleaned it women won't laugh along with you when you crack horse penis jokes so don't even

49:55.920 --> 50:02.480
go there with us okay now it's getting this is starting to veer heavily away from like horses

50:03.440 --> 50:07.920
don't talk about dicks just because i'm around a bunch of republican conservative yahoos doesn't

50:07.920 --> 50:16.640
make me one a jewish liberal equestrian it cannot be whoa man what hold on this is narrow casting

50:16.640 --> 50:22.160
i think right now we're we're getting uh we're intercepting a message intended for one person

50:22.160 --> 50:29.120
um i sometimes worry that as much as i love horses i might hate horse people you know

50:29.920 --> 50:36.880
i hate half horse half people too well no wait no i'm saying like centaurs they can keep it to

50:36.880 --> 50:41.600
themselves i'm done with it centaurs always prancing around uh just because i'm a centaur

50:41.600 --> 50:48.640
doesn't mean i can't poop in the potty like a big boy just because my centaur kids only have three

50:48.640 --> 50:53.840
acres i know what i'm doing thanks they don't have shoes they don't that's because i'm poor

50:54.480 --> 50:59.680
yes i'm half horse but i also eat things other than hay and grains i mean i will eat hay and

50:59.680 --> 51:06.400
grains because they're delicious but i could have a steak if i wanted uh yes my body does have two

51:06.400 --> 51:15.120
