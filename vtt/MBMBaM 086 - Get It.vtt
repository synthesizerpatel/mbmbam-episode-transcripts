WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:51.600
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, let us welcome you to 20 Does.

00:52.480 --> 00:55.040
20 Does or 20 Doesn't.

00:55.040 --> 01:02.320
20 Does, 20 Do this year. I have a, what do you guys feel about 20 Does? Because I feel like

01:02.320 --> 01:05.440
it's going to be real super hyphy.

01:05.440 --> 01:09.120
I'm thinking that in the future people will refer to this year as the really doesn't.

01:10.480 --> 01:14.240
I want people to refer to it as the my brother, my brother and me year.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.280
Is that, can we do that?

01:15.280 --> 01:17.040
The year of my brother, my brother and me?

01:17.040 --> 01:18.480
Yeah. My bim bam year.

01:18.480 --> 01:25.040
I have resolved myself to making 20 Does the year that I just get it.

01:28.080 --> 01:30.080
I just want to get it this year.

01:30.080 --> 01:32.160
A lot of times I see Griffin and I'm like,

01:32.800 --> 01:36.560
he is going at it full bore, but I'm not sure he's getting it.

01:38.160 --> 01:46.400
When is that fool just going to steal his nerves and ready himself and just get it?

01:46.400 --> 01:50.160
It seems like we're always so close to getting that brass ring.

01:51.760 --> 01:57.440
20 Does I think is the year where we grab it just by its big round body and say, hello ring.

01:57.440 --> 01:59.680
Hello ring, you're mine now. I got you.

01:59.680 --> 02:00.800
We got you this time.

02:00.800 --> 02:03.040
We got you this time in 20 Does.

02:03.040 --> 02:06.400
This is my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.560
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

02:08.560 --> 02:10.960
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.960
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

02:12.960 --> 02:17.840
And for the new listeners in 20 Does, maybe we can explain what we do.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.800
What is it we does on this show?

02:20.800 --> 02:21.760
We get it.

02:21.760 --> 02:22.720
We get it?

02:22.720 --> 02:23.360
Every time.

02:24.880 --> 02:28.720
You give us your questions and you say, guys, I'm not getting it.

02:28.720 --> 02:30.160
I'm not going full bore.

02:30.160 --> 02:32.320
And we say, listen, amp it.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.840
First you amp it and then you get it.

02:35.840 --> 02:38.640
You got to fire on all eight cylinders all the time.

02:38.640 --> 02:39.280
All eight.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.240
You got to punch the sky.

02:41.680 --> 02:42.720
Punch the sky.

02:42.720 --> 02:46.880
No, we take questions that people send in and we answer them to the best of our ability,

02:46.880 --> 02:48.080
which usually isn't pretty good.

02:48.640 --> 02:53.200
And also we do the same thing to people in the Yahoo Answers service

02:53.200 --> 02:54.800
who did not send in their questions,

02:55.680 --> 02:59.920
but we still give them the full consideration of our heart of hearts.

03:00.720 --> 03:04.960
And then sometimes we do a Mad Lib.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.400
Sometimes Travis does a Mad Lib.

03:06.400 --> 03:09.360
You won't hear that on this episode because it's the new year

03:09.360 --> 03:11.760
and we're all far too hung over to put up with that.

03:11.760 --> 03:12.000
Yep.

03:12.000 --> 03:12.480
Yep.

03:13.600 --> 03:16.000
Like, for example, the level of comedy you're going to get

03:16.000 --> 03:18.080
when Griffin said far too hung over.

03:18.080 --> 03:20.320
I heard fart toot hung over.

03:20.320 --> 03:20.720
Okay.

03:20.720 --> 03:22.160
So that's about it.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.600
Solid gold.

03:23.600 --> 03:25.440
Solid gold brass ring.

03:25.440 --> 03:29.920
Did you guys take 2000 in Heaven out with a bang last night?

03:29.920 --> 03:31.920
And by a bang, I mean drinking?

03:32.560 --> 03:32.800
Yeah.

03:33.520 --> 03:33.920
Absolutely.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.200
I consume beverages.

03:35.200 --> 03:39.360
And hey, this is to like everybody on TV.

03:39.360 --> 03:42.000
Can I go through a year?

03:42.000 --> 03:43.520
Can I, is it possible?

03:43.520 --> 03:47.600
Is it legal to ring in a new year without the Black Eyed Peas there?

03:48.160 --> 03:51.200
Like, do they, are they just, are they building the ball

03:51.200 --> 03:53.120
and making it drop like the beat?

03:53.120 --> 03:57.200
Because I have to assume one of their parents is financing the whole thing

03:57.200 --> 03:58.640
and that's how they get to keep playing.

03:59.200 --> 03:59.760
Has to be.

03:59.760 --> 04:01.840
Like they sponsored all of 2012.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.040
It's like their year.

04:03.040 --> 04:06.160
It's like, it seems like you can't do anything

04:06.160 --> 04:08.160
without one of those guys sneaking in.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.440
Yeah.

04:09.440 --> 04:11.600
They, they officiated my wedding.

04:12.240 --> 04:12.880
Yeah.

04:12.880 --> 04:13.920
Against your will.

04:13.920 --> 04:14.640
Against my will.

04:14.640 --> 04:18.880
I didn't want to, but God, once they make the beat drop.

04:18.880 --> 04:19.120
Yeah.

04:19.120 --> 04:19.440
Yeah.

04:19.440 --> 04:20.880
Let the beat drop.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.600
Then like, I didn't have a say in the matter anymore.

04:23.600 --> 04:23.920
Yeah.

04:23.920 --> 04:25.920
And you were like, I thought it was supposed to be a different priest

04:25.920 --> 04:28.240
and they were like, this is mega switch up.

04:28.240 --> 04:28.480
Yeah.

04:29.280 --> 04:30.720
Last night there was.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.040
Is that Black Eyed Peasly Arc?

04:33.040 --> 04:33.360
Yeah.

04:33.360 --> 04:33.600
Yeah.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.440
Mega switch up.

04:35.440 --> 04:42.400
Last night, Will.i.am did a solo number and he was introduced by Fergie and not,

04:43.200 --> 04:46.560
she didn't make reference to the fact that she knows him fairly well.

04:47.920 --> 04:50.880
Being in the Black Eyed Peas and all.

04:50.880 --> 04:54.080
It was like, he, she, she just said, now this is new up.

04:54.080 --> 04:56.240
So Will.i.am, check him out.

04:56.240 --> 04:57.920
My former cohort.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.920
My former cohort before the debt.

04:59.920 --> 05:02.400
Known associate, Will.i.am.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.840
We were employed together by the beat.

05:05.840 --> 05:10.960
Now a man I know from a Dr. Pepper commercial we did together, it's Will.i.am.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.200
But enough advising Fergie.

05:15.200 --> 05:19.760
She stopped listening after the first time we did a fun drive.

05:19.760 --> 05:22.880
So she's a fair weather fan at best.

05:23.520 --> 05:25.520
Let's move on to the real stalwarts.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.640
Guys, I just got a haircut and I hate it.

05:28.640 --> 05:31.760
At the barbershop, I took off my glasses for the haircut and when it was over,

05:31.760 --> 05:33.120
I couldn't see how it looked.

05:33.120 --> 05:34.640
I just assumed it was fine.

05:35.360 --> 05:38.400
When I got home, I looked in the mirror and noticed that it was horrible.

05:38.400 --> 05:41.200
Is it okay to go back to the barbershop and demand a redo?

05:41.760 --> 05:43.840
How can I make it as unawkward as possible?

05:43.840 --> 05:45.520
That's from Campion10.

05:45.520 --> 05:48.560
Campion, I don't think you know how hair works.

05:48.560 --> 05:51.440
Yeah, you don't get a mulligan.

05:51.440 --> 05:52.400
You just get a mullet.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.880
Yeah, you, it doesn't like, you're not a Play-Doh man.

05:58.880 --> 06:05.840
I'm confused by the concept that like, so I get me, I have to take my glasses off too

06:05.840 --> 06:06.560
when I get a haircut.

06:06.560 --> 06:07.520
Everyone with glasses does.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.880
Did you fail to put them on before you got home?

06:11.680 --> 06:11.920
Yeah.

06:11.920 --> 06:13.840
Like crash.

06:14.800 --> 06:15.440
Bad haircut.

06:17.040 --> 06:22.160
Is it possible that it actually looks pretty dope and you're just not used to it?

06:22.160 --> 06:22.400
Yeah.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.200
Hey, let me see.

06:23.200 --> 06:23.920
Let me take a look.

06:25.040 --> 06:26.720
Pull your haircut up to your iPod.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.400
Yeah, looks good.

06:28.400 --> 06:32.880
The trick, do you guys want to know the trick to always getting a good haircut?

06:32.880 --> 06:33.360
What's that?

06:33.360 --> 06:38.800
Well, I know this, people, stylists die for this kind of info, so I can't believe I'm

06:38.800 --> 06:39.840
giving it out for free.

06:40.320 --> 06:47.120
What you have to do is get a haircut from somebody who you think is attractive.

06:47.120 --> 06:47.920
Oh, really?

06:47.920 --> 06:52.080
Yeah, because they're not going to cut, they know what looks good, obviously.

06:52.080 --> 06:54.480
Look at how attractive they are, right?

06:54.480 --> 06:59.760
They want to shape other people into other good looking people, so there's more people

06:59.760 --> 07:03.840
at the sex parties that they want to get invited to if they're ugly.

07:04.480 --> 07:04.800
Right.

07:05.440 --> 07:09.120
I'm saying no pretty is going to make you into an elko.

07:09.120 --> 07:12.320
Unless they're hoarding it.

07:12.320 --> 07:16.720
Unless they're doing it on purpose to make themselves look better.

07:16.720 --> 07:18.800
That's why you got to go to the opposite sex.

07:18.800 --> 07:22.240
If you go to someone of the same sex, they don't want the competition for the pack.

07:22.240 --> 07:29.840
Yeah, and they might give you a tonsure up there, or they might just slit your throat.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.240
Yeah, bake you into pies.

07:32.240 --> 07:35.360
The barber saw a racist fingerprint, so they would never be caught.

07:35.360 --> 07:39.520
Yeah, I mean, they're sitting in a chair that's surrounded with pictures of your kids.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.520
So there are clues, I'm not saying there are clues.

07:43.520 --> 07:48.160
Before you returned to the barber and asked for a redo, did you save your receipt?

07:48.160 --> 07:50.160
Because without your receipt, you don't get that redo.

07:50.720 --> 07:51.120
Really?

07:51.120 --> 07:51.920
Yeah.

07:51.920 --> 07:54.400
You have to present documentation, huh?

07:54.400 --> 07:58.080
Yeah, otherwise you roll up and the barber's like, I don't even remember you.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.680
You just have an ugly haircut now.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.680
I would never cut that hair that way.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.920
If it's a bad haircut, I think you need to go.

08:04.560 --> 08:07.600
I don't think there's an unawkward way of doing it.

08:07.600 --> 08:12.080
I think you need to go to somebody else and say, hey, what can you do for me?

08:12.080 --> 08:14.400
Because obviously you don't like their haircut style.

08:14.400 --> 08:15.840
You don't like how they're doing it.

08:15.840 --> 08:16.960
Go to someplace else.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.120
You know, I've actually done this before.

08:19.120 --> 08:23.680
I've actually gone back to a place and been like, hey, this is kind of weak.

08:23.680 --> 08:26.640
And it was like the sides of my hair were uneven or something.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.320
They cut one side shorter than the other.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.240
It was real bad.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.880
And then I rolled back up to the place and I was like, hey, fix it.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.320
Yeah, can you?

08:34.320 --> 08:37.440
I mean, that is just, that's just shoddy workmanship.

08:37.440 --> 08:38.960
That's not even a style question.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.480
Unless that's a hip style now.

08:41.120 --> 08:44.480
Is the R. Kelly long on one side, short on the other?

08:44.480 --> 08:44.640
Right.

08:44.640 --> 08:48.080
Nine tenths of good haircutting cutsmanship is preparation.

08:48.080 --> 08:51.040
I think you got to go, you got to find the right person.

08:51.040 --> 08:54.480
If you go to a barbershop, I have this a lot in Austin as I'll go to a barbershop

08:55.120 --> 08:59.120
and it'll be one of those rando situations, like a upscale fantastic Sam's.

09:00.160 --> 09:03.200
Or I, you know, sit down and who knows who I get this time.

09:03.200 --> 09:06.240
And sometimes it's an attractive woman.

09:06.240 --> 09:11.760
And sometimes it's a man and half of his hair is bleached blonde and the other half is bright pink.

09:11.760 --> 09:15.520
And he's like, let's do this. And I'm like, I don't think I want to do this.

09:15.520 --> 09:17.120
I don't know what's going to happen up there.

09:17.840 --> 09:22.320
If this happens, I want to hold out, hold out for a new, I'm going to hold out.

09:22.320 --> 09:22.880
I'm going to sit here.

09:22.880 --> 09:26.400
I'm going to finish my Shiner and I'm going to read the paper.

09:26.400 --> 09:34.640
Ladies and gentlemen, if you, if you, if you get a good haircut once ever, never, you can't move.

09:34.640 --> 09:38.320
You can't go hold on to that person.

09:38.320 --> 09:42.560
They're the most valuable person to you in your whole life because they know how to cut it the way you like it.

09:42.560 --> 09:46.000
I have for a while, I was driving back to my girl, Mo, back in Huntington.

09:46.000 --> 09:55.200
My man, my man, Sunny, up at the, up at the master cuts, up at the Huntington mall, just, just, just next to tilt the arcade.

09:55.200 --> 09:57.520
He, he will, he will take care of you.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.200
Tell him, tell him Justin sent you.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.560
Cause he remembers my name.

10:00.560 --> 10:01.600
He remembers my name.

10:01.600 --> 10:02.880
He remembers my name.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.080
He remembers my name.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.040
He remembers my name.

10:05.040 --> 10:08.240
Tell him, tell him Justin set you cause he remembers my name.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.560
Well, he calls me buddy, but I know he knows my name.

10:10.560 --> 10:13.600
I bet he always just calls me buddy.

10:14.480 --> 10:15.280
Why don't you buzz it?

10:16.720 --> 10:20.160
Ooh, buzz it down self, self medication there, huh?

10:20.160 --> 10:22.720
I've been actually thinking about it's ridiculous.

10:22.720 --> 10:27.600
I go to a barber and I paid them $13 to buzz my hair with a size six guard.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.360
Like I think I could probably do that myself.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.920
I'm impressed that you know the size guard that you use when I go in.

10:33.920 --> 10:36.640
If I don't, what if they use a size four guard?

10:36.640 --> 10:37.840
And then it's like, well, see, that's what's weird.

10:37.840 --> 10:39.360
I walk in and they say, what size?

10:39.360 --> 10:41.680
And I'm like, I honestly couldn't tell you.

10:41.680 --> 10:44.080
And they're like, you know, we'll start with like a three or something.

10:44.080 --> 10:45.440
And then it's always too short.

10:46.320 --> 10:47.200
Always too short.

10:48.160 --> 10:48.960
Learn your number folks.

10:48.960 --> 10:50.320
Life is so hard.

10:50.320 --> 10:50.560
Yeah.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.320
Here's what I do.

10:52.320 --> 10:55.040
It haircut, hair cutters love this.

10:56.080 --> 11:00.480
Just start, just say, just clean it up a little bit and then just keep telling them that like,

11:00.480 --> 11:01.760
no, not quite clean enough.

11:01.760 --> 11:04.240
And that way you can ease them into it.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.640
And then when it works, take a picture.

11:06.640 --> 11:10.480
You're going to sound like you have like OCD or something.

11:10.480 --> 11:10.880
My hair is not clean enough.

11:10.880 --> 11:15.040
You're the one that has to live with the haircut for six months or eight months

11:15.040 --> 11:17.920
or maybe even like 12 months.

11:17.920 --> 11:20.560
I need you to make it cleaner on the sides by which I mean,

11:21.520 --> 11:23.840
shave my basketball number into those.

11:25.040 --> 11:26.240
They call me clean sweep.

11:26.240 --> 11:31.200
Will you please take up one sideburn, but just the one.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.280
Can you put those fun lines in the side?

11:34.560 --> 11:36.160
Hey, I have a job car up there.

11:36.160 --> 11:36.480
Please.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.680
I have a job interview in the new year for position.

11:39.680 --> 11:42.160
I'm totally under qualified for it.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.600
It'd give me a great salary.

11:43.600 --> 11:47.440
It's pretty much my dream job and it would allow me to move to London.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.760
How can I fool my interviewers into thinking their company will go into administration?

11:51.760 --> 11:54.400
Unless I'm on board.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.080
That's from skeptical in Scotland.

11:56.080 --> 11:59.120
For those that don't know, going into administration is like going bankrupt here.

11:59.120 --> 12:00.320
Ah, okay.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.920
Here?

12:01.920 --> 12:03.280
In the US of A.

12:03.280 --> 12:03.760
Oh, okay.

12:05.520 --> 12:06.480
What did you think I meant?

12:07.040 --> 12:08.000
On this show?

12:08.000 --> 12:10.080
Well, here my brother, my brother and me.

12:10.080 --> 12:12.320
You made it sound like we were in the UK.

12:13.440 --> 12:14.480
Oh, okay.

12:14.480 --> 12:15.840
Pushing made it so.

12:15.840 --> 12:16.560
Okay.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.240
Yeah, we'll get over there UK.

12:18.240 --> 12:19.040
You just hold out.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.240
Start sending us money now.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.640
Why wouldn't you qualify yourself for your dream job?

12:26.640 --> 12:28.560
What are you doing?

12:28.560 --> 12:31.920
Why is the one thing you want to do more than anything on earth the one thing you're not

12:31.920 --> 12:33.520
qualified to do?

12:33.520 --> 12:35.600
What have you been preparing to do?

12:35.600 --> 12:37.280
Yeah, what have you been preparing for?

12:38.160 --> 12:39.440
Did something else fall through?

12:40.720 --> 12:46.000
I dream of being a ballerina so I've trained to be a lumberjack and I just hope it works out.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.560
Maybe just don't tell them you're under qualified.

12:51.360 --> 12:52.720
Yeah, I mean, yes, Travis.

12:52.720 --> 12:56.320
I think that that goes without saying is don't say don't give me this job because I'd be bad

12:56.320 --> 12:56.800
at it.

12:56.800 --> 13:00.080
No, but I'm saying like I don't know what special prep you would have to do because

13:00.080 --> 13:01.760
they like can't read your mind.

13:01.760 --> 13:03.680
They're not going to give you an on the spot test.

13:04.480 --> 13:09.840
My name is Dylan and I'm from Scotland and I'm unqualified for this position.

13:10.560 --> 13:12.080
I suck at this.

13:12.080 --> 13:14.000
I don't know where I am.

13:14.560 --> 13:15.680
This is my dream.

13:15.680 --> 13:18.560
So you made this come true.

13:18.560 --> 13:23.040
Maybe, maybe you could play that aspect and be like, listen, straight up.

13:23.040 --> 13:29.760
I have no idea the fuck what I'm doing, but think of how educational this experience.

13:29.760 --> 13:31.120
I am a lump of clay.

13:31.120 --> 13:33.920
Think about how I will learn from this.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.840
Think about how I will better my oh no.

13:35.840 --> 13:37.440
Oh, okay.

13:37.440 --> 13:38.480
You're standing up.

13:38.480 --> 13:38.960
Is that it?

13:38.960 --> 13:40.000
Okay, I should go.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.640
Okay, so I should just I should just here's the thing in this day and age.

13:44.640 --> 13:50.320
People change jobs, millennials, no one is tied to any one position anymore, which makes

13:50.320 --> 13:57.920
which makes it makes a creating past work experience just the easiest thing.

13:57.920 --> 14:01.920
Yeah, pick a friend, give right down their cell phone number.

14:01.920 --> 14:05.280
Say they were the manager at the now defunct, etc.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.400
And then and then have the manager call them.

14:10.400 --> 14:14.720
Your friend will say whatever you tell him to, you know, have have the manager call us.

14:15.760 --> 14:16.960
We'll say whatever you want.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.320
Yeah, yeah, I'll say I'll lie.

14:18.320 --> 14:20.960
I'll put my five dollars, I'll tell them you were president.

14:21.840 --> 14:25.600
Can you stretch your job titles at your jobs?

14:25.600 --> 14:27.760
Because nobody definitely nobody's going to check that.

14:27.760 --> 14:33.120
Like, instead of being a cashier at Taco Bell, say you were like a taco coordinator.

14:35.840 --> 14:40.000
I was a sort of a gordita middleman.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.360
I guess you could say I think what you're looking for is chalupa artisan.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.040
I was a nacho cheese engineer.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.680
That part is true.

14:47.680 --> 14:51.200
Is it possible that it's not like they're underqualified,

14:51.200 --> 14:54.000
like they don't have the use of experience, but they're underqualified?

14:54.000 --> 15:00.720
Like, it's a job as like an engineer or like as a surgeon and they just don't.

15:00.720 --> 15:02.800
Well, I fucking hope it's not a surgeon.

15:03.440 --> 15:04.560
Yeah, I hope so, too.

15:05.200 --> 15:09.120
I don't think the people who listen to our show are clinically unstable,

15:09.120 --> 15:10.880
which seems to be the picture that you're painting.

15:11.520 --> 15:12.800
Now, come in here, Dylan.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.960
What prepares you to be a marine biologist?

15:15.680 --> 15:16.480
Nothing.

15:16.480 --> 15:16.960
Nothing.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.320
Absolutely nothing.

15:18.320 --> 15:19.840
I like fish and I'm scared of water.

15:19.840 --> 15:20.560
Let's get this done.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.840
Let's learn some shit about otters.

15:23.840 --> 15:24.400
I got you.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.080
I got an underwater microscope.

15:26.080 --> 15:26.560
Come on.

15:28.640 --> 15:29.520
Science.

15:29.520 --> 15:30.320
Where's the whale?

15:31.120 --> 15:32.000
Where's the whale at?

15:32.640 --> 15:34.080
Which one's the shark again?

15:34.080 --> 15:34.480
Okay.

15:34.480 --> 15:35.280
Yeah, that's right.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.080
I want to put my microscope on a shark.

15:38.080 --> 15:40.640
I'm going to call in that big fish like Jonah did.

15:40.640 --> 15:41.520
Remember?

15:41.520 --> 15:43.120
Learn about his inside part.

15:43.120 --> 15:45.760
By the way, I only believe in sciences in the Bible.

15:45.760 --> 15:46.960
Let's do this.

15:46.960 --> 15:47.840
I'm unqualified.

15:47.840 --> 15:49.040
The Bible and Pinocchio.

15:50.000 --> 15:50.800
This is my dream.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.520
This is my dream, sir.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.560
This is my dream job.

15:54.560 --> 15:55.600
I fucking hate fish.

15:56.240 --> 15:56.880
I hate this.

15:56.880 --> 15:57.440
Let's do it.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.160
Come on, you slimy bitches.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.000
Look at him flop around on the table.

16:04.000 --> 16:04.720
This is crazy.

16:05.280 --> 16:06.720
Somebody get me a science knife.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.080
I'm going to go to town on this fish.

16:09.680 --> 16:10.640
Give me a science knife.

16:10.640 --> 16:12.080
I gots to cut this whale open.

16:12.080 --> 16:14.400
Tell you what, I'm not qualified for this job,

16:14.400 --> 16:16.880
but I'm going to dissect this octopus right in front of you.

16:16.880 --> 16:17.360
Watch.

16:17.360 --> 16:18.400
You watch.

16:18.400 --> 16:18.960
You watch.

16:19.600 --> 16:20.800
I'm going to cut off some squid legs.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.080
Put it on this octopus.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.000
Make the ultimate tentacle monster animal.

16:26.720 --> 16:27.440
Is this science yet?

16:27.440 --> 16:28.080
Did we do it?

16:29.440 --> 16:30.560
I want to do some science.

16:30.560 --> 16:31.360
Drop me in this tank.

16:31.360 --> 16:34.160
I'm going to tie this octopus's legs together like Popeye.

16:34.960 --> 16:35.360
Come on.

16:35.360 --> 16:36.480
I'm going to do some science.

16:36.480 --> 16:37.600
Drop me a beat.

16:37.600 --> 16:38.640
Drop me a beat.

16:38.640 --> 16:39.280
Drop me a beat.

16:39.280 --> 16:40.640
I'll write something like Bill Nye.

16:40.640 --> 16:41.360
Science guy.

16:41.360 --> 16:42.320
Like a science song.

16:42.320 --> 16:44.240
You guys want to?

16:44.240 --> 16:45.440
Oh, marine biologists.

16:45.440 --> 16:48.000
I bet you didn't know your job was that funny,

16:48.000 --> 16:51.920
but that's exactly the kind of insight you can expect every week in 20 Does.

16:51.920 --> 16:52.560
Here, I'm my brother.

16:52.560 --> 16:53.200
My brother and me.

16:53.200 --> 16:53.840
You want a Yahoo?

16:54.400 --> 16:55.440
Yes, please.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.720
First Yahoo of 20 Does.

16:56.720 --> 16:57.280
20 Does.

16:57.280 --> 16:57.920
Let's make it count.

16:57.920 --> 16:59.360
This one was sent in by Team Money.

16:59.360 --> 17:01.200
Thank you, Team Money.

17:01.200 --> 17:01.760
You're welcome.

17:02.320 --> 17:04.880
It's by Yahoo answer user Chi, who asks,

17:06.880 --> 17:09.280
is there a charity where I can donate to walruses?

17:10.720 --> 17:12.160
I really love walruses.

17:12.160 --> 17:13.840
And I would like to donate to them.

17:13.840 --> 17:15.280
Is there one you could think of?

17:15.280 --> 17:16.480
Thank you for your help, everyone.

17:16.480 --> 17:17.200
Happy New Year.

17:18.080 --> 17:19.680
Like directly to the walrus?

17:19.680 --> 17:20.960
That's what it sounds like, isn't it?

17:21.600 --> 17:22.720
He wants to get right at him.

17:22.720 --> 17:26.560
He doesn't want it to get hung up in like overhead.

17:26.560 --> 17:27.040
Yeah.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.040
Where can I take my walrus sweaters?

17:30.240 --> 17:30.960
I want this.

17:30.960 --> 17:31.920
I don't want this overhead.

17:31.920 --> 17:35.520
I want to under tusk in their mouth.

17:35.520 --> 17:39.760
I think the most direct option is obviously go to the Arctic Circle

17:39.760 --> 17:41.840
and fucking just make it rain.

17:43.040 --> 17:44.000
Make it rain fish.

17:44.000 --> 17:50.000
Just like stick some hundos to their blubbery, wrinkly, gray skin.

17:50.800 --> 17:55.200
A lot of people don't know what walruses need, walruses need now.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.240
What do they need?

17:56.240 --> 18:00.000
Like after the terrible earthquakes in Haiti, a lot of people were like,

18:00.640 --> 18:03.280
send money, send dollars, just send us some cash.

18:03.920 --> 18:06.240
But then they didn't realize they have different money in Haiti.

18:06.240 --> 18:08.000
So they couldn't do anything with it.

18:08.000 --> 18:08.560
They ate it.

18:08.560 --> 18:10.240
They used the money.

18:10.240 --> 18:13.760
They used the dollar bills to make compresses and food.

18:14.640 --> 18:16.080
They didn't know what to do with it.

18:16.080 --> 18:17.920
You know, I actually read about this.

18:17.920 --> 18:19.840
You know what walruses need more than anything?

18:19.840 --> 18:20.800
What's that?

18:20.800 --> 18:21.360
Counseling.

18:21.920 --> 18:22.640
Yeah.

18:22.640 --> 18:23.120
Really?

18:23.120 --> 18:23.520
Are they?

18:23.520 --> 18:24.320
Yeah, they just need to talk.

18:25.440 --> 18:26.640
They just need to talk.

18:26.640 --> 18:29.760
They are the ugliest thing on the earth, I think.

18:29.760 --> 18:33.520
You know, it's that kind of mentality that are giving these walruses issues.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.000
That's kind of cruel of God, isn't it though?

18:36.000 --> 18:39.520
And he's like, let's make them put sharp stuff on their face.

18:39.520 --> 18:40.560
Let's make them fat.

18:40.560 --> 18:42.480
And then also, let's throw a mustache on them.

18:43.040 --> 18:45.280
And then let's make them really, really sensitive.

18:46.480 --> 18:49.840
Not a lot of people know that they are the most emotionally sensitive animals.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.080
Now, they don't seem awful enough.

18:52.080 --> 18:56.720
So let's make them eat seals, which is nature's most beautiful animal.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.960
Yeah, and make them look like ugly seals.

18:58.960 --> 19:01.280
So like the parallelism is lost.

19:01.280 --> 19:02.800
It's going to be really great.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.040
Can you imagine when you're a walrus?

19:05.040 --> 19:07.600
Like at first, you think, well, this sucks.

19:07.600 --> 19:11.120
But at least everybody else is in the same boat as me.

19:11.120 --> 19:17.840
And then the first time you see like a beautiful deer, or like a beautiful pelican.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.440
Just a water deer skippering across the water.

19:19.440 --> 19:20.800
Look at that beautiful water stag.

19:21.520 --> 19:26.240
Like, oh, you got you have four legs instead of one stupid leg.

19:26.240 --> 19:29.200
Oh, you don't bark like an idiot.

19:29.200 --> 19:29.680
Okay, great.

19:29.680 --> 19:30.560
Cute little bushy tail.

19:30.560 --> 19:30.960
That's great.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.240
Hey, where's your mustache?

19:32.240 --> 19:32.720
Don't have one.

19:32.720 --> 19:33.760
Oh, you don't have one.

19:33.760 --> 19:34.640
Don't have one.

19:34.640 --> 19:37.680
Can we get these walruses some like mustache tremors?

19:39.040 --> 19:40.000
I don't think they want that.

19:40.000 --> 19:48.240
That's a sign of everybody knows that the walrus's facial hair is the sign of their masculinity.

19:48.240 --> 19:49.760
Okay, what about mustache wax?

19:49.760 --> 19:51.120
Let's turn that into handlebars.

19:51.760 --> 19:54.400
Yeah, now see that with some preening.

19:54.400 --> 19:55.360
I bet they love that.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.440
That would help them to feel not so bad about themselves.

19:57.440 --> 19:59.040
Walruses do love irony.

19:59.040 --> 20:03.680
If we could wrap some tight denim around their chubby, chunky tails.

20:03.680 --> 20:07.520
Can we get some walrus skinny jeans, please?

20:08.080 --> 20:09.440
Thank God knows they could use it.

20:10.480 --> 20:13.520
I was into krill long, long before it was popular.

20:16.240 --> 20:17.920
Hey, did you guys get the new Krillex?

20:21.840 --> 20:22.720
Oh, Krillex.

20:22.720 --> 20:23.760
God damn.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.840
Yeah, he's always good for a laugh.

20:25.840 --> 20:26.720
He sure is.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.320
Well, at least for me he is.

20:28.320 --> 20:33.040
Hey brothers, I was wondering what you thought about dating girls who have a much different

20:33.040 --> 20:35.120
personality and lifestyle from your own.

20:35.120 --> 20:38.720
I have this friend and I was thinking about asking her out sometime soon, but the more

20:38.720 --> 20:42.880
I just hang out with her, I see that her lifestyle is very different from my own.

20:42.880 --> 20:45.760
She's the kind of girl who would go out to a party at night.

20:46.320 --> 20:49.200
Well, I would rather spend the night relaxing in my dorm room.

20:49.760 --> 20:54.160
And now I just question whether having a different lifestyle should stop me

20:54.160 --> 20:55.440
from asking her out at all.

20:55.440 --> 20:59.280
That's from asking in Alaska.

20:59.280 --> 21:00.480
No, it shouldn't stop you.

21:01.040 --> 21:01.440
Next.

21:02.480 --> 21:03.920
I mean, it could be exciting, right?

21:03.920 --> 21:04.560
That's love.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.760
That's what the heart wants.

21:07.760 --> 21:10.000
I mean, not a lot can be done about that.

21:10.000 --> 21:15.280
Although, I mean, will it force you?

21:15.280 --> 21:19.920
You have to realize that in a sense, this could be very good for you, right?

21:19.920 --> 21:25.040
Like, I think it's good to have that balance in a relationship where one person wants to

21:25.040 --> 21:28.400
do this, another person wants to do another thing, and you find a happy medium.

21:28.400 --> 21:34.800
Now, there might be some friction as a result, but I think it's better for yourself in the

21:34.800 --> 21:35.120
long run.

21:35.120 --> 21:36.960
It's better for your day to day.

21:36.960 --> 21:38.240
Just be prepared to...

21:39.600 --> 21:41.760
You're gonna have to be prepared to be flexible about it.

21:41.760 --> 21:45.360
You're gonna have to be prepared to, you know?

21:45.360 --> 21:46.080
To give a little.

21:46.800 --> 21:47.520
Exactly.

21:47.520 --> 21:51.760
I would say the only concern I would have about it is if her behavior is in any way

21:51.760 --> 21:52.560
self-destructive.

21:52.560 --> 21:59.760
Like, you know, if by partying, I mean, like, she's going out and just, you know, doing

21:59.760 --> 22:02.480
a bunch of drugs and destroying herself, then I could see why that would be a problem.

22:02.480 --> 22:05.440
But if she just likes to have a good time and hang out with her friends and is a social

22:05.440 --> 22:11.280
person, then maybe, you know, when you're in that relationship, maybe there's a balance

22:11.280 --> 22:15.600
where you go out more often than you normally would, and she stays home with you more often

22:15.600 --> 22:20.320
than she normally would, and you find a good balance and kind of, you know, are good for

22:20.320 --> 22:20.960
each other.

22:20.960 --> 22:24.880
Guys, what we're dealing with here is a classic along came Polly scenario.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.280
Yeah, classic Polly.

22:27.280 --> 22:32.960
What you gotta do is you gotta just let yourself live, let yourself love, let yourself...

22:32.960 --> 22:34.400
And then eat some sidewalk nuts.

22:34.400 --> 22:39.360
Don't eat spicy Indian food at a party and then have diarrhea.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.320
And wipe your butt with a ferret, if I remember correctly.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.120
Oh, is that really...

22:43.680 --> 22:44.480
Oh, God.

22:44.480 --> 22:48.080
Can you stop dropping, like, specific references to this movie?

22:48.080 --> 22:49.600
Like, you just watched it this week.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.040
It really creeps me out when you do that.

22:51.920 --> 22:54.480
So you don't want me to talk about, like, you gotta watch out for when you go on your

22:54.480 --> 22:59.120
honeymoon and then your wife sleeps with the scuba instructor, as played by Hank Azaria?

23:00.080 --> 23:04.400
No, I don't want to know about any more along came Polly related things.

23:05.360 --> 23:09.920
When you go see your best friend, Philip Seymour Hoffman in Jesus Christ Superstar at a community

23:09.920 --> 23:10.240
theater.

23:10.880 --> 23:17.280
This is a new year, it's a new slate, and you are muddying that slate with your shit,

23:17.280 --> 23:20.400
with your human feces, which is along came Polly.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.480
Yeah, but to be fair, that movie didn't introduce me to the word shart, so...

23:24.480 --> 23:27.680
As it introduced America, sir.

23:27.680 --> 23:31.680
Sir, and all our lives are richer for it.

23:31.680 --> 23:35.280
I would never take that away from from Philip Seymour Hoffman, but...

23:35.280 --> 23:39.680
You know, you guys can give me shit all you want to, but I'm just preparing to be qualified

23:39.680 --> 23:42.480
for my dream job as a long came Polly historian.

23:42.480 --> 23:43.040
Okay.

23:43.040 --> 23:46.320
That is my dream job too, however, I am woefully unqualified.

23:46.320 --> 23:47.440
Woefully unqualified for it.

23:48.640 --> 23:52.480
Have you seen that super meta movie one night at the along came Polly museum?

23:54.080 --> 23:54.720
It's great.

23:54.720 --> 24:00.240
It's about Ben Stiller working in a museum for along came Polly, and then all the characters

24:00.240 --> 24:00.720
come to life.

24:01.760 --> 24:03.120
He is still very, very sad.

24:03.120 --> 24:04.480
Could not keep my Stiller straight.

24:05.600 --> 24:10.160
Actually, the role of the Ben Stiller mannequin when he comes to life is played by Hank Azaria.

24:10.160 --> 24:11.600
It gets very confusing.

24:11.600 --> 24:11.840
Yeah.

24:12.560 --> 24:14.400
And Owen Wilson, I bet it's in there somewhere too.

24:14.400 --> 24:15.760
You know he's in the mix.

24:15.760 --> 24:18.240
Maybe playing Luke Wilson just to further muddy that.

24:18.880 --> 24:19.280
Weird.

24:19.920 --> 24:22.960
I just just just try it.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.400
What's the worst that's gonna happen?

24:24.400 --> 24:27.200
I mean, it's listen, it's 20 does.

24:27.200 --> 24:31.360
I'm gonna give this blanket advice out to everybody who's under the thrall of my voice

24:31.360 --> 24:31.920
right now.

24:31.920 --> 24:33.360
It's 20 does.

24:33.360 --> 24:34.240
Get it.

24:34.240 --> 24:38.320
If you have a question about should I, the answer is get it.

24:38.960 --> 24:39.280
Yes.

24:39.840 --> 24:40.400
Get it.

24:40.400 --> 24:41.120
Just get it.

24:41.120 --> 24:42.000
And maybe it'll work out.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Maybe it won't, but you won't know until you get it.

24:44.000 --> 24:44.800
Get it.

24:44.800 --> 24:45.280
Yes.

24:45.280 --> 24:46.880
No regrets in 20 does.

24:46.880 --> 24:47.920
Just say yes.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.200
Just say yes and get it.

24:49.200 --> 24:50.480
Just go on a rampage.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.840
We're gonna go get high and then go to the bowling alley.

24:53.840 --> 24:54.400
Are you in?

24:54.400 --> 24:54.960
Yes.

24:54.960 --> 24:55.200
Get it.

24:55.200 --> 24:56.000
Yeah, I am.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.360
I want to do high bowling.

24:57.360 --> 24:58.400
I want to get strikes.

24:59.200 --> 25:00.480
I want to get striked up.

25:01.200 --> 25:04.720
Let's go get striked up and let's go let's go bowl together.

25:05.440 --> 25:06.880
Do you want to go to a funeral with me?

25:06.880 --> 25:08.080
I would rather not.

25:08.080 --> 25:13.200
But I will because I'm opening myself up to new experiences even if they're depressing

25:13.200 --> 25:13.760
in some way.

25:13.760 --> 25:15.120
We'll have some smelling salts.

25:16.160 --> 25:19.440
We'll rave and we'll get it at the funeral.

25:19.440 --> 25:19.760
We'll see.

25:19.760 --> 25:21.040
That's what your grandma would want.

25:22.080 --> 25:25.120
That's what she would want is just to rave and get nuts.

25:25.120 --> 25:26.240
20 does guys.

25:26.800 --> 25:27.520
I'm done.

25:27.520 --> 25:30.080
I'm done equivocating with people.

25:30.080 --> 25:30.480
I'm done.

25:30.480 --> 25:31.520
So that's the slogan.

25:31.520 --> 25:33.440
20 does rave at a funeral.

25:33.440 --> 25:34.160
Rave at a funeral.

25:34.160 --> 25:35.120
20 yes.

25:35.120 --> 25:39.760
We're gonna rave into this into the the great good night that will come to claim us all

25:40.640 --> 25:41.520
in late December.

25:41.520 --> 25:44.720
But until then everybody let's just give it a shot.

25:44.720 --> 25:51.360
I am going to stave off Quetzalcoatl with two glow sticks on the top of a fucking mountain

25:51.360 --> 25:54.880
just blasting Skrillex just like come get it.

25:56.160 --> 25:57.280
Ready for you.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.080
Not this day.

25:59.760 --> 26:04.080
If you're gonna eat me you're gonna have to eat my stupid cat in the hat hat too.

26:06.880 --> 26:09.520
Enjoy this adult size pacifier you bitch.

26:09.520 --> 26:14.320
Let's make Quetzalcoatl our pitch this year and just say yes.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.480
Do I want to ask her out?

26:16.480 --> 26:17.120
Yeah sure.

26:17.680 --> 26:18.800
She broke my heart.

26:18.800 --> 26:19.600
Ask again.

26:19.600 --> 26:20.800
Ask someone different.

26:20.800 --> 26:22.960
Ask that same person but in a different way.

26:22.960 --> 26:24.960
Ask her out using a Quetzalcoatl line.

26:24.960 --> 26:27.280
Like listen time is limited here.

26:27.280 --> 26:28.800
We need to get moving.

26:28.800 --> 26:30.320
Can I ask you a Quetzalcoatl?

26:34.880 --> 26:35.840
Oh shit.

26:35.840 --> 26:37.520
Hey Griffin.

26:37.520 --> 26:37.760
Yeah.

26:37.760 --> 26:38.720
Yeah.

26:38.720 --> 26:42.720
Before Quetzalcoatl comes I need to build a bomb shelter and the only way I can do that

26:42.720 --> 26:47.120
is with money and the only way I know how to make money is with The Money Zone.

26:57.280 --> 27:05.200
This week on The Money Zone we are being driven there first off by our dear friends

27:05.200 --> 27:07.200
Vincent and Paul Goldberg.

27:07.200 --> 27:08.000
Goldberg?

27:09.040 --> 27:10.240
Goldberg the goalie.

27:10.240 --> 27:15.280
No Goldberg is getting butt cheek friendship tattoos.

27:16.480 --> 27:20.560
They didn't know what what it was going to be and and this is a Christmas present for

27:20.560 --> 27:26.880
Paul Goldberg which is everybody knows are the perfect the perfect things the perfect

27:26.880 --> 27:28.000
thing for Paul Goldberg.

27:28.720 --> 27:31.280
They want to know what they should get on their butts on their bottoms.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.800
Well a tattoo that just says butt.

27:34.800 --> 27:37.680
But no that's not not very good.

27:37.680 --> 27:39.680
Can the tattoo be butt colored?

27:40.560 --> 27:42.320
Uh-huh a butt color tattoo?

27:42.320 --> 27:43.680
So that nobody is going to see it.

27:44.800 --> 27:54.720
I have always wanted to get a tattoo of Herve Villiches and he's rolling up his sleeve and

27:54.720 --> 27:59.120
on his arm is a tattoo of the band Tattoo.

27:59.120 --> 27:59.440
Uh-huh.

28:00.080 --> 28:02.880
So if you guys wanted to get so many layers to that.

28:02.880 --> 28:03.760
I know right.

28:03.760 --> 28:08.320
If you guys want to get that tattoo of Tattoo with the Tattoo of Tattoo that would be I

28:08.320 --> 28:08.960
think ideal.

28:09.680 --> 28:12.720
There's probably another level of abstraction you could get there but I don't know what

28:12.720 --> 28:12.880
it would be.

28:12.880 --> 28:17.520
Can I get a what about a tattoo of Bob Seger with a tattoo of me?

28:20.720 --> 28:23.200
Now why would Bob Seger get a tattoo of you Griffin?

28:23.200 --> 28:28.320
Well he wouldn't but in this fictional universe that I've painted on my body forever.

28:28.960 --> 28:31.760
What about a tattoo of Bob Seger except with my head?

28:31.760 --> 28:34.400
So it's Bob Seger's body.

28:34.400 --> 28:37.120
Okay but it would have to say like under it this is Bob Seger.

28:37.920 --> 28:40.400
He has to wear a t-shirt that just says Bob Seger.

28:40.400 --> 28:40.640
Okay.

28:41.680 --> 28:45.920
Nobody could tell Bob Seger just by his body or at least more specifically nobody who's

28:45.920 --> 28:50.400
going to see my butt could tell could tell Bob Seger just from his body.

28:50.400 --> 28:56.480
So guys I hope that I hope that helps you and I hope that hope that that's that's enough

28:56.480 --> 29:01.920
of a inspiration that you can find something that really works for your personal butt.

29:01.920 --> 29:06.720
Also taking us to the money zone this week our friends our dear friends Topataco.

You're going to be supporting people like our friend Corey Schmitz.

You're going to find things you won't find anywhere else.

30:00.640 --> 30:02.640
You want to peep up his nasty gum shirt?

30:02.640 --> 30:03.360
They can do that.

30:03.360 --> 30:05.520
They can make that dream a reality for you.

30:05.520 --> 30:08.320
Do you want them to draw a really crazy picture of a rhinoceros?

30:09.040 --> 30:11.200
They might do that too on your receipt.

30:11.200 --> 30:12.240
They're crazy over there.

30:13.120 --> 30:18.240
They once they once drew a picture of a really disturbed really disturbing picture of

30:18.240 --> 30:22.960
Lisa Loeb's glasses on somebody's package once.

30:22.960 --> 30:26.240
It was all very upsetting but they're the best people in the world and we love them very much.

30:27.680 --> 30:29.440
So here's a shitty song for them.

30:29.440 --> 30:30.800
So here's a shitty jingle for them.

30:32.080 --> 30:40.800
I don't have anything.

30:40.800 --> 30:54.560
Do you want cheese and sour cream?

30:57.920 --> 30:59.120
You can't do that.

30:59.120 --> 31:00.720
It's not a taco.

31:00.720 --> 31:05.600
It's a website and they sell t-shirts for free.

31:06.400 --> 31:07.760
No, they're not free.

31:07.760 --> 31:14.160
They cost actual money, but that money goes to us.

31:18.960 --> 31:24.800
Topataco.com and buy stuff.

31:25.920 --> 31:29.200
Specifically maximum fun gear.

31:29.200 --> 31:30.480
So we don't buy.

31:30.480 --> 31:32.080
I want that maximum fun.

31:32.080 --> 31:39.280
Don't buy anything that says stop podcasting yourself or judge John Hodge or any of those other guys.

31:39.280 --> 31:40.400
Jordan Jesse go forget.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.240
Jordan Jesse no, I say.

31:42.240 --> 31:44.560
Just buy our stuff and give us your money.

31:44.560 --> 31:48.160
My brother and my brother in glee is what you'll have in your heart when you buy our stuff.

31:48.160 --> 31:52.320
In fact, what you should do is you should pay them extra money to not send you the other stuff.

31:53.440 --> 31:56.880
Yeah, here's $10 to not send me a Jordan Jesse go shit.

31:56.880 --> 31:57.840
God, I love money.

31:59.280 --> 32:00.160
I love it too.

32:00.160 --> 32:03.040
I love it too, but do actually buy their stuff too because we love it.

32:03.040 --> 32:03.920
Yeah, their stuff is fine.

32:03.920 --> 32:05.200
But first buy our stuff.

32:06.720 --> 32:08.960
Don't use all your don't use up all your money.

32:08.960 --> 32:09.440
We need it.

32:10.240 --> 32:13.840
You should buy our stuff and then buy their stuff to keep our stuff in.

32:17.360 --> 32:22.400
It's a t-shirt I bought for my t-shirt to keep it warm.

32:26.480 --> 32:27.120
Hello there.

32:27.120 --> 32:29.680
My name is Graham Clark and I'm Dave Shumka.

32:29.680 --> 32:33.520
And together we host a podcast called Stop Podcasting Yourself.

32:33.520 --> 32:37.920
This is a file that you download from the internet and then you listen to it in your pod.

32:37.920 --> 32:39.360
What's that about you ask?

32:39.360 --> 32:40.800
Well, who are you to ask?

32:40.800 --> 32:41.920
Who do you think you are?

32:41.920 --> 32:43.920
Yeah, get lost bozo.

32:43.920 --> 32:48.320
We're a couple of stand up comedians in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

32:48.320 --> 32:50.960
And every week we bring a guest on the show.

32:50.960 --> 32:52.240
Sometimes they're Canadian.

32:52.240 --> 32:53.520
Sometimes they're not.

32:53.520 --> 32:54.880
Sometimes they're a ghost.

32:54.880 --> 32:58.160
It's like you're sitting in on a friendly afternoon chat.

32:58.160 --> 33:00.960
Plus we're Canadian, so you get a tax break.

33:02.160 --> 33:05.840
You can find us on iTunes or online at Maximumfun.org.

33:10.800 --> 33:11.680
You guys want a Yahoo?

33:12.240 --> 33:12.640
Yeah.

33:12.640 --> 33:14.080
This one was sent in by Lisa Holofield.

33:14.080 --> 33:14.640
Thank you, Lisa.

33:14.640 --> 33:15.360
It's by Yahoo!

33:15.360 --> 33:17.520
Industries user CrashFu who asks,

33:18.640 --> 33:22.960
what is a good team name for a softball team sponsored by a male performance enhancement

33:22.960 --> 33:23.280
clinic?

33:23.280 --> 33:27.120
True story, I was thinking 10 bats and 20 balls, but that's a load to put on a shirt.

33:27.120 --> 33:27.620
Help.

33:30.240 --> 33:30.960
Big swingers.

33:32.640 --> 33:39.040
Well, that, that, that, um, I guess that has a certain charm.

33:39.040 --> 33:39.760
Sort of feel.

33:41.760 --> 33:42.800
Um, bat boys.

33:45.760 --> 33:49.200
So you're just sticking with the, a bat looks like a penis.

33:49.200 --> 33:49.700
Yeah.

33:49.700 --> 33:50.240
Bonus.

33:50.240 --> 33:50.740
Okay.

33:50.740 --> 33:51.280
I gotcha.

33:51.280 --> 33:51.780
Okay.

33:51.780 --> 33:53.640
Okay. Well, that one was not very good.

33:53.640 --> 34:02.440
That one, uh, um, can it be like a traditional team?

34:02.440 --> 34:06.600
Like the Levitra Lions is Levitra.

34:06.600 --> 34:07.640
The Boner Tigers.

34:07.640 --> 34:08.140
Okay.

34:10.800 --> 34:12.640
Travis, I don't think you're very good at this.

34:12.640 --> 34:14.640
Um, Cox Cox.

34:14.640 --> 34:17.840
And it's like penis and a rooster.

34:18.880 --> 34:20.400
No, that one needs to be worse.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.720
No, that one needs to be workshopped a little bit more.

34:24.880 --> 34:25.920
Let's start over.

34:25.920 --> 34:29.520
No, let's think about this because there's a lot of questions you have to answer first.

34:29.520 --> 34:29.680
Okay.

34:29.680 --> 34:30.640
Let me ask you this.

34:30.640 --> 34:32.800
What do you think about not so shortstop?

34:32.800 --> 34:35.120
Ooh, that's good.

34:35.840 --> 34:36.880
That's not bad, right?

34:36.880 --> 34:39.600
That's, that's something, something there, ma'am.

34:42.240 --> 34:42.740
Hmm.

34:43.200 --> 34:43.680
Do you think?

34:44.800 --> 34:45.520
Humpire.

34:46.080 --> 34:46.640
Humpire?

34:46.640 --> 34:47.600
Humpire?

34:47.600 --> 34:48.100
No.

34:48.100 --> 34:49.780
No, that's not, that's not bad.

34:51.060 --> 34:52.260
Do you think that anybody?

34:52.260 --> 34:54.180
RBI runs bonered in.

34:54.180 --> 34:54.580
Okay.

34:56.820 --> 34:59.140
I'm more confused by the mechanics of the team.

34:59.140 --> 35:05.460
I want to know if anybody on the team is physically capable of diving into a plate without,

35:05.460 --> 35:08.180
I think they're going to land right on the boner is what I think.

35:08.180 --> 35:10.740
And I think that that's kind of put some friction on the ground.

35:10.740 --> 35:12.900
I think it's going to keep them from reaching their destination

35:13.460 --> 35:15.060
and also break their penis in half.

35:15.060 --> 35:17.620
It'll at least break the bone.

35:17.620 --> 35:18.340
Look at a fracture.

35:19.300 --> 35:20.820
Definitely fracture that penis bone.

35:21.780 --> 35:25.940
I think it would be, this would be the team that you would probably dread playing against.

35:25.940 --> 35:26.340
Well, yeah.

35:26.340 --> 35:28.980
Because they got that self-satisfied look on their faces.

35:30.100 --> 35:31.460
And you can't bring your children.

35:31.460 --> 35:31.780
Yeah.

35:31.780 --> 35:35.300
Concession stands hated because nobody wants to buy a corn dog and watch the team.

35:38.260 --> 35:41.700
Can anybody, can any local business have a baseball team?

35:41.700 --> 35:44.340
Because if so, that seems, that seems kind of fucked up.

35:44.340 --> 35:47.380
Like can funeral homes be like, Hey, we're the dead people team.

35:47.380 --> 35:55.620
And can like, can like sex, sex, candy, toy stores be like, you know, sex, candy, toy stores.

35:56.180 --> 35:56.660
Yeah.

35:56.660 --> 35:58.900
Well, at least it would make, it would make lines.

35:58.900 --> 36:01.460
Then that would be very easy to pick a mascot.

36:01.460 --> 36:01.780
Yeah.

36:01.780 --> 36:03.220
And the pleasure chest pirates.

36:04.100 --> 36:04.500
Right.

36:04.500 --> 36:04.980
Exactly.

36:05.620 --> 36:09.940
I'm willing to bet that when you are a, an amateur softball team,

36:10.740 --> 36:12.420
beggars can't be choosers.

36:12.420 --> 36:12.820
Yeah.

36:12.820 --> 36:16.740
I doubt very much that there's, there's much wiggle room there as far as who you

36:16.740 --> 36:17.940
allow to sponsor your team.

36:17.940 --> 36:19.460
And if you don't, what about wiggle room?

36:20.740 --> 36:21.140
Yeah.

36:21.140 --> 36:23.380
I think there's going to be a shortage of wiggle room all around.

36:24.500 --> 36:28.020
Can we get back to our community and start our own softball team?

36:29.460 --> 36:31.300
My brother, my brother and me boners.

36:31.300 --> 36:36.020
Well, can we actually look into how much it would be, how much it would cost to sponsor

36:37.220 --> 36:38.740
a softball team in someone's area?

36:38.740 --> 36:41.140
200 tops, right?

36:41.140 --> 36:42.740
Tops 200. Yeah.

36:42.740 --> 36:44.500
Like so well worth it.

36:44.500 --> 36:45.940
I mean, how much does a bat cost?

36:45.940 --> 36:47.060
They only need the one bat.

36:47.620 --> 36:49.460
That's like 10 bucks.

36:49.460 --> 36:50.340
10 bucks for the bat.

36:51.140 --> 36:54.900
If you're a local softball team would like us to sponsor them, please email us.

36:54.900 --> 36:55.380
No kidding.

36:55.380 --> 36:58.980
We have a, like, I don't want to toot our horns, but we have a grip of listeners.

36:58.980 --> 37:02.020
Certainly we can find 10 people who are baseball.

37:02.020 --> 37:03.940
Can you be the Bim Bambinos?

37:03.940 --> 37:04.980
Oh my God.

37:04.980 --> 37:06.580
That's a fucking awesome name, right?

37:06.580 --> 37:07.460
Mm-hmm.

37:07.460 --> 37:07.700
Yeah.

37:07.700 --> 37:08.260
It'd be good.

37:08.260 --> 37:08.980
It would be really good.

37:08.980 --> 37:15.060
But I would want to go with something like my brother, my brother and me, like home run.

37:15.060 --> 37:15.940
Murderers.

37:15.940 --> 37:16.260
Yeah.

37:16.260 --> 37:16.900
The murderers.

37:19.140 --> 37:20.020
The molesters.

37:21.540 --> 37:22.260
I don't want to play against that team.

37:22.260 --> 37:23.620
Okay, so we'll sponsor your team.

37:24.420 --> 37:27.860
But in exchange, you have to have like the most embarrassing name.

37:28.660 --> 37:33.700
I don't think that, I think that no matter what you can call your team,

37:33.700 --> 37:42.260
people are not going to, they're not going to like you because of the connotations of your sponsor.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.420
That's all they're going to be able to think about.

37:44.420 --> 37:47.220
They're not going to, maybe that would be good as a smoke screen though.

37:47.220 --> 37:53.300
They're giggling up their sleeve about how you're like the Viagra vagabonds or something.

37:53.300 --> 37:56.260
And meanwhile, you're getting all the touchdowns.

37:56.260 --> 38:01.380
I think that you just hit on a great name, Justin, and you could be the Viagra gigglers.

38:01.380 --> 38:07.860
What about hard dicks?

38:10.980 --> 38:11.460
Go on.

38:13.060 --> 38:13.540
That's it.

38:14.180 --> 38:15.620
Okay, okay.

38:15.620 --> 38:16.260
What about it?

38:16.260 --> 38:19.220
All right, well, that's a pretty good starting point.

38:19.220 --> 38:22.500
What about erections with a Z?

38:24.500 --> 38:25.300
New erections.

38:28.100 --> 38:29.380
Second chance erections.

38:29.380 --> 38:37.780
I feel like baseball doesn't have enough sexual innuendo goofing possibilities.

38:37.780 --> 38:46.180
Like I feel like if this was basketball, we would already have like 100 to 125 different names.

38:46.180 --> 38:48.660
Do you think basketball is a sexier sport than baseball?

38:49.540 --> 38:53.140
No, I just think that baseball, because they've got like the bats and balls,

38:53.140 --> 38:57.620
it's so, as far as like penis jokes goes, it's like it's making the joke already.

38:57.620 --> 39:04.980
Like it's already so clear you have to go real deep cut to find anything worthwhile.

39:06.740 --> 39:12.660
I think we've all been to a baseball arena and seen a guy with a baseball bat

39:13.620 --> 39:15.140
duct tape to his crotch.

39:15.140 --> 39:16.820
Like, oh, I've got a big wooden penis.

39:16.820 --> 39:19.460
Like we've all seen that one.

39:19.460 --> 39:19.940
That could be their mascot.

39:19.940 --> 39:21.220
We've all seen that in our dreams.

39:21.220 --> 39:22.580
That could be their mascot though.

39:24.980 --> 39:25.620
Dick bats.

39:25.620 --> 39:27.460
That's inappropriate.

39:27.460 --> 39:28.260
Can that be the name?

39:28.260 --> 39:28.900
The Dick Bats?

39:30.260 --> 39:30.900
Dick Bats.

39:30.900 --> 39:34.020
I did really love his talk show back in the late 60s.

39:34.980 --> 39:36.420
The Dick Bats Variety Hour.

39:40.900 --> 39:42.180
He goes by Richard Bats now.

39:43.540 --> 39:46.180
He was sort of like a more more ethnic Lawrence Welk.

39:48.340 --> 39:49.300
But I really liked it.

39:49.300 --> 39:54.500
Did we have a single good joke in that entire question?

39:54.500 --> 39:56.260
Remember when we said Dick Bats?

39:57.220 --> 39:58.660
I don't think that was funny.

40:00.180 --> 40:06.100
Hey everybody, this is where you get to make your own gag.

40:06.100 --> 40:06.900
Just write in.

40:06.900 --> 40:09.140
Say, hey, I came up with a better gag than you guys did.

40:10.580 --> 40:13.700
But you got to make sure to drink a lot the night before or else you're cheating.

40:13.700 --> 40:18.980
Hey, I have a brother.

40:18.980 --> 40:23.460
He lives in another town, so I keep in touch with him mostly through phone conversations.

40:24.500 --> 40:29.460
The problem is, sometimes he'll decide to use the bathroom in the middle of our conversation.

40:29.460 --> 40:32.500
He doesn't think it's a big deal, but it grosses me out.

40:32.500 --> 40:36.100
I told him that I would stop speaking to him if he continues to do it, but he's starting

40:36.100 --> 40:38.100
to simply continue doing it without telling me.

40:40.260 --> 40:42.740
You can't give your brother an opening like that.

40:42.740 --> 40:46.580
Please tell my brother to stop making his bathrooms while we are making a conversation.

40:46.580 --> 40:49.380
That's from Euphemistic and Eugene.

40:51.780 --> 40:55.620
You can't tell your brother that you don't like something, especially something that

40:55.620 --> 40:57.060
he can continue to do to you.

40:59.380 --> 41:00.900
How bad are you at brothers?

41:02.900 --> 41:03.400
Why?

41:04.340 --> 41:11.060
You shouldn't be able to have a conversation with anyone except your lover.

41:11.060 --> 41:16.420
Anyone except your lover in which you can have a conversation with them and also be

41:16.420 --> 41:18.020
able to see and touch your penis.

41:18.900 --> 41:20.260
That's just my ground rule.

41:22.420 --> 41:29.380
That's my base level for conversation skills, is if you can see and touch your penis, you

41:29.380 --> 41:31.620
shouldn't be talking to anyone.

41:31.620 --> 41:32.820
That's a good rule.

41:32.820 --> 41:34.580
Yeah, it's a pretty good rule, Travis.

41:35.460 --> 41:37.060
It's like the best rule that there is.

41:37.060 --> 41:40.580
If you can see and touch your penis.

41:40.580 --> 41:42.420
See and or see and or.

41:43.220 --> 41:44.420
I can't imagine.

41:44.420 --> 41:44.980
I mean, you can.

41:44.980 --> 41:46.660
I guess you can always touch your penis.

41:48.340 --> 41:48.900
Trust me.

41:50.020 --> 41:55.940
As numerous suspensions in grade school will attest, you can always touch your penis.

41:55.940 --> 41:57.700
He is your constant companion.

41:57.700 --> 42:01.380
I can't imagine actually a scenario where you can see your penis but not touch it.

42:02.420 --> 42:05.220
I can only think some kind of like bound and gag situation.

42:05.220 --> 42:05.940
It's right there.

42:05.940 --> 42:06.900
Please.

42:06.900 --> 42:08.420
Why are you in that glass cage?

42:10.180 --> 42:12.420
Unless you're Pikachu, I guess, in which case.

42:13.060 --> 42:15.780
What if you get stuck in like a glass floor?

42:17.140 --> 42:18.260
Sorry, what were you saying, Travis?

42:19.140 --> 42:20.340
You're stuck in a glass floor.

42:21.540 --> 42:25.460
So your top half is above the glass and your bottom half is below the glass.

42:26.100 --> 42:27.460
Like if you're in a big glass castle.

42:28.260 --> 42:29.060
Just think about it, guys.

42:29.060 --> 42:29.380
It makes complete sense.

42:29.380 --> 42:30.820
It's so fucking dumb, though.

42:31.700 --> 42:32.900
It's a dumb thing.

42:32.900 --> 42:35.220
I said this funny thing about Pikachu and then you're like.

42:35.220 --> 42:35.860
He nailed it again.

42:35.860 --> 42:37.380
How about a word fart, everybody?

42:37.940 --> 42:38.820
I got one for you.

42:41.700 --> 42:43.300
Remember when I said that thing about Pikachu?

42:43.860 --> 42:46.100
I love that you said Pikachu and not like a T-Rex,

42:46.100 --> 42:49.620
which I think more people would understand the arm to body ratio of.

42:49.620 --> 42:51.140
Pikachu's got wicked short arms, everybody.

42:52.020 --> 42:55.140
Travis is inventing a scenario with half-body glass cages.

42:55.140 --> 42:56.740
Hey, you get me out of this.

42:56.740 --> 42:59.140
No, you're a key member in this fart.

42:59.140 --> 43:00.020
You're deep in it.

43:00.820 --> 43:02.740
There's no extraction from here.

43:02.740 --> 43:05.700
What are you and your brother talking about that you can't that he can't take

43:05.700 --> 43:07.780
like a five minute break from the phone convo?

43:09.380 --> 43:10.820
Yeah, it can't be that important.

43:12.180 --> 43:14.180
That's where you say, hey, I'll call you right back.

43:14.180 --> 43:14.900
I got a deuce.

43:15.540 --> 43:19.700
Maybe when you call him, you say like, hi, I wanted to catch up,

43:19.700 --> 43:24.260
but I just I want to know if you were going to have to duty in the next 15 minutes or so.

43:24.260 --> 43:25.940
What's your battle situation currently?

43:27.220 --> 43:28.580
When did you last evacuate?

43:28.580 --> 43:31.940
Uh, tell your brother to do it right last because by 2015,

43:31.940 --> 43:34.980
I think every call will be a video call, right?

43:34.980 --> 43:36.900
I mean, we'll all have moved on to that tech.

43:36.900 --> 43:39.380
Yeah, so he's not going to be able to sneak one in on you anymore.

43:40.340 --> 43:41.700
Well, it doesn't sound like he's sneaking it.

43:41.700 --> 43:43.140
It sounds like he's proud of it.

43:43.140 --> 43:45.060
Yeah, it sounds like he's reveling.

43:45.060 --> 43:50.260
What if he decorates the wall behind his toilet to look like some sort of cafe?

43:52.580 --> 43:55.300
Oh, so you're saying like in in peewee's playhouse

43:55.300 --> 43:57.380
that he pulls down the screen behind him.

43:57.380 --> 44:00.980
Yes, he pulls it down and then you FaceTime with him.

44:00.980 --> 44:03.540
And then you think, oh, he's at a trendy bistro.

44:03.540 --> 44:07.460
So really, he's dropping, dropping child, getting it done, getting it.

44:08.260 --> 44:12.260
I think that if you make a one, that's okay on the phone.

44:12.260 --> 44:14.420
I think I think once he once he's more upsetting.

44:14.420 --> 44:15.940
Yeah, because you can hear a onesie.

44:17.780 --> 44:19.940
There's also the chance that he drops you in the toilet.

44:19.940 --> 44:20.500
Mm hmm.

44:20.500 --> 44:21.700
And then you're in his pee.

44:21.700 --> 44:22.260
Guess what?

44:22.260 --> 44:23.220
Your brother peed on you.

44:23.220 --> 44:23.720
Oops.

44:24.580 --> 44:25.080
Whoops.

44:25.540 --> 44:26.040
Oops.

44:26.040 --> 44:27.060
You have to kill yourself.

44:27.060 --> 44:29.700
No, you're a dead man.

44:29.700 --> 44:30.260
Now you're dead.

44:30.820 --> 44:31.700
Dead man walking.

44:34.100 --> 44:36.500
Hey, brother, stop, stop doing this.

44:37.620 --> 44:38.180
Sorry.

44:38.180 --> 44:39.140
No, not you.

44:39.940 --> 44:40.180
Okay.

44:40.180 --> 44:40.740
The email.

44:40.740 --> 44:41.940
Me? Is it me?

44:44.260 --> 44:49.860
I am happy to tell you guys that I have never made a bowel movement

44:49.860 --> 44:51.140
while I've been on the phone with you.

44:51.700 --> 44:54.100
While I have been podcasting with you.

44:54.100 --> 44:55.940
That is a different story altogether.

44:55.940 --> 44:57.140
Uh huh. Uh huh.

44:57.140 --> 45:01.860
But as far as phone calls, direct one to one telephonic conversation,

45:02.420 --> 45:04.580
no, no bathrooms.

45:04.580 --> 45:09.620
So so you you've bathroomed while on the phone with the world,

45:10.340 --> 45:12.260
but not individually with us.

45:12.820 --> 45:18.740
Justin has made millions of people watch him as he uses the bathroom.

45:19.300 --> 45:22.260
Well, Griffin, I otherwise I can't finish.

45:22.260 --> 45:23.300
Okay, so.

45:23.300 --> 45:25.860
Finish using the bathroom, I hope you mean, and not the other.

45:25.860 --> 45:26.900
Christ, I hope so.

45:26.900 --> 45:30.020
Hey, I recently introduced a friend of mine to your podcast.

45:30.020 --> 45:33.300
He loves it, but he's recently given me calls to question his taste.

45:34.100 --> 45:36.100
He has raised the subject of wanting to buy what he calls

45:36.820 --> 45:38.580
feety pajamas.

45:38.580 --> 45:41.860
The one piece sleepwear of children and crazy old men.

45:41.860 --> 45:44.900
I, a girl, find this to be terrible.

45:44.900 --> 45:46.820
And I'm hoping you guys can set him right.

45:46.820 --> 45:48.340
And that's from Concerned in Canada.

45:49.140 --> 45:50.420
He should get it.

45:50.420 --> 45:50.820
Get it.

45:51.380 --> 45:52.740
It's 20 does.

45:52.740 --> 45:53.300
Get it.

45:54.020 --> 45:55.460
Does it have rubber soles?

45:55.460 --> 45:58.340
Are the rubber soles and the fuzzy slippers on the bottom?

45:58.340 --> 46:02.100
I just I just want to throw this out because as I was listening to the question,

46:02.100 --> 46:06.020
I had the best image pop in my head and it's of this dude in feety pajamas.

46:06.020 --> 46:07.060
Just raging, girl.

46:07.060 --> 46:08.020
Does he have a big beard?

46:08.020 --> 46:09.860
Because in mine, he has a big beard.

46:09.860 --> 46:11.540
Yeah, my beard in mine.

46:11.540 --> 46:16.820
He's a half glass case in the top of his body and he can't can't adjust his feety pajamas.

46:16.820 --> 46:18.100
Oh, feety pajamas.

46:18.100 --> 46:23.220
That's a perfect example of when you can neither see nor touch your penis.

46:23.220 --> 46:24.660
OK, that's fair.

46:24.660 --> 46:27.700
Does it have what if it's a forever lazy and then there's the zipper in the front?

46:27.700 --> 46:30.580
Is there a flap in the back for his fanny to hang out of?

46:31.220 --> 46:32.580
Oh, that'd be adorable.

46:32.580 --> 46:33.700
Look at his little fanny.

46:33.700 --> 46:34.820
He's going to get a suntan.

46:35.940 --> 46:40.020
So he's got a big old beard and the flap is open and he's raging drunk.

46:40.020 --> 46:43.060
He's got a cute little fanny except he's 36 years old.

46:43.060 --> 46:49.540
And he's got a tattoo of Herve Villiches on his butt.

46:49.540 --> 46:52.020
I think if I could pull it off.

46:52.900 --> 46:54.180
I'm not sure I could pull it off.

46:54.740 --> 46:59.300
I think it would make me a little claustrophobic because I like my feet to be out there.

46:59.300 --> 47:01.860
Like I want them sometimes they want to go off on their own.

47:01.860 --> 47:05.380
They want to get out from under the blanket or peel off a sock or what have you.

47:05.380 --> 47:10.260
But I think if I could really commit to the look, I think it could be super cozy.

47:10.260 --> 47:16.180
Super cozy, I wonder what it seems like such a specific time that that would be appropriate.

47:16.180 --> 47:18.180
And that is when you are alone forever.

47:19.860 --> 47:23.140
Yeah, it doesn't seem like you could wear that to anything.

47:23.140 --> 47:27.940
Like if you had friends or family with you, you can't wear that.

47:27.940 --> 47:31.460
But you shouldn't be in your PJs with friends and family around anyway.

47:31.460 --> 47:33.940
Like you shouldn't be changing into those.

47:33.940 --> 47:36.740
Yeah, but if you're having like a lazy Sunday afternoon with a lover

47:36.740 --> 47:40.980
and you curl it up on the couch and you're watching Netflix.

47:40.980 --> 47:42.900
You just finished a session of lovemaking.

47:42.900 --> 47:46.740
You just finished making love and she's wearing some cute,

47:47.700 --> 47:50.660
literally anything other than one piece, feedie pajamas.

47:51.540 --> 47:54.740
And you roll up there in your one piece, feedie pajamas.

47:56.020 --> 47:56.820
The jig is up.

47:57.700 --> 48:00.980
Unless you turn it around backwards and the flaps on the front and your dick's hanging out.

48:00.980 --> 48:04.100
That's a worse look than the look that it could possibly be.

48:04.100 --> 48:06.260
That's a power move though.

48:06.980 --> 48:11.300
That is, she will know who is dominating that relationship and it is her.

48:11.300 --> 48:11.860
And then all you-

48:13.140 --> 48:19.460
Can that be the official uniform of the boner softball team?

48:19.460 --> 48:20.500
Yes, it can.

48:20.500 --> 48:21.540
My brother, my brother and me.

48:25.220 --> 48:25.780
Check it out.

48:28.500 --> 48:31.860
I think there's so many other sleepwear alternatives that are more comfortable.

48:31.860 --> 48:35.540
Cause feedie pajamas are just like a big fucking full body textile prison.

48:36.260 --> 48:36.660
Yeah.

48:36.660 --> 48:37.380
Can't get out of it.

48:37.380 --> 48:40.260
All it is, it's like a bathroom booby trap.

48:40.260 --> 48:45.940
All your smells, all your smells get trapped in there and they come out your neck.

48:45.940 --> 48:47.060
And you know what's right above your neck?

48:47.780 --> 48:48.340
Your nose.

48:49.860 --> 48:51.060
That's not gonna be good for you.

48:54.260 --> 48:55.380
What about a big shirt?

48:56.580 --> 48:57.860
Would you guys wear a night shirt?

48:57.860 --> 49:02.660
Yeah, I'd wear like an Ebenezer Scrooge style night shirt every day of my life, right?

49:02.660 --> 49:04.180
With that little bent over hat.

49:04.180 --> 49:06.260
Why are you wearing a hat to bed Ebenezer Scrooge?

49:08.580 --> 49:09.300
I'm in a pickle.

49:09.860 --> 49:12.420
My boss at my current job has a crush on me.

49:12.420 --> 49:15.860
This works out pretty well, generally, and she is fun to talk to.

49:15.860 --> 49:19.540
But, office ethics aside, I'm not attracted to her.

49:20.580 --> 49:25.140
I'm worried if I'm too forward in shooting her down, it may make working under her

49:25.140 --> 49:26.980
more complicated.

49:26.980 --> 49:29.220
What would a McElroy do in my shoes?

49:29.220 --> 49:32.340
Thanks from Dave in Accounting.

49:32.340 --> 49:32.820
Get it.

49:32.820 --> 49:33.380
Get it.

49:33.380 --> 49:34.660
Just get it.

49:34.660 --> 49:35.700
Get the brass ring.

49:37.140 --> 49:37.700
Full bore.

49:38.660 --> 49:44.180
I just, why don't you just say, I don't, I love you.

49:46.580 --> 49:47.380
Just tell her.

49:47.380 --> 49:50.900
I love you, but I'm not in love with you and can I get that promotion?

49:51.940 --> 49:52.980
Then you get me twice.

49:52.980 --> 49:53.620
Why do you have to?

49:53.620 --> 49:56.420
Then you get me twice.

49:56.420 --> 49:58.100
Why do you have to shoot her down at all?

49:58.100 --> 49:58.340
Yeah.

49:58.900 --> 50:00.180
She's your boss.

50:00.180 --> 50:00.980
She's the boss.

50:00.980 --> 50:02.900
That means if she says you're going out, you are.

50:04.420 --> 50:06.180
That's the way the world works, Dave.

50:06.900 --> 50:08.900
Otherwise it's insubordination.

50:08.900 --> 50:09.860
Dave.

50:09.860 --> 50:11.940
That kind of thing get you court-martialed, Dave.

50:12.660 --> 50:15.060
Make her, make you go out with her.

50:15.620 --> 50:16.500
Run that shit.

50:16.500 --> 50:17.460
Run that flagpole.

50:17.460 --> 50:18.980
Run that up HR's flagpole.

50:18.980 --> 50:22.340
Uh-huh, and then you, she gets fired.

50:22.340 --> 50:23.140
You get her job.

50:23.140 --> 50:24.580
You get it three times.

50:25.380 --> 50:31.780
Listen, you have a, you have a perfect out here and it's that you don't think it's ethical.

50:32.740 --> 50:35.700
Say, listen, girl, I want us to be together.

50:35.700 --> 50:37.140
I love your look.

50:37.140 --> 50:38.340
I love your style.

50:38.340 --> 50:46.980
I love your ways and your moves, but I can't, I can't two, two people who both work at TJ

50:46.980 --> 50:56.340
Maxx in the infant and mom section, they can't date each other because what if, what if it goes raw?

50:56.340 --> 50:59.780
But what if she loves you so much that like she quits her job and then you're just like,

50:59.780 --> 51:00.580
oh, I was kidding.

51:01.220 --> 51:02.180
Well, then she quits her job.

51:02.180 --> 51:02.900
She's not your boss.

51:02.900 --> 51:03.860
Problem solved.

51:03.860 --> 51:04.420
Oh, okay.

51:04.420 --> 51:04.980
I love it.

51:04.980 --> 51:05.540
It's win-win.

51:05.540 --> 51:07.140
Yeah, she can't make trouble.

51:07.140 --> 51:10.340
I mean, she could go out to the parking lot and slash your tires or something, but she

51:10.340 --> 51:12.260
can't make trouble for you in the office anymore.

51:12.260 --> 51:19.220
I'm upset about how you think of TJ Maxx as some sort of feudal hierarchy where the boss

51:19.220 --> 51:20.980
can make you an indentured servant.

51:21.540 --> 51:22.420
There's a tiered system.

51:22.420 --> 51:23.780
You're my dating slave.

51:23.780 --> 51:24.180
Yeah.

51:24.180 --> 51:26.260
I'm a, oh, I'm, I work at TJ Maxx.

51:26.260 --> 51:26.820
I'm a serf.

51:27.380 --> 51:27.860
It's great.

51:28.580 --> 51:33.540
The hours are awful and I have to marry whoever my boss tells me to, but it's okay because

51:33.540 --> 51:34.660
I get an acre of land.

51:36.180 --> 51:38.100
TJ Maxx named the business after himself.

51:38.100 --> 51:39.220
He's clearly a despot.

51:40.420 --> 51:41.540
So obviously.

51:41.540 --> 51:42.260
Right, exactly.

51:42.260 --> 51:42.820
There's a feudal system.

51:42.820 --> 51:45.140
Tiberius Jonas Maxx is an asshole.

51:45.140 --> 51:45.860
Yeah.

51:45.860 --> 51:46.820
I'm naming you.

51:47.380 --> 51:49.540
I'm naming you Lord of Incidentals.

51:52.420 --> 51:55.300
You shall be the ruler of all the intimate section.

51:56.980 --> 52:00.500
I was going to say that TJ Maxx is part of the 1%, but I don't think I've ever crossed

52:00.500 --> 52:02.100
the threshold of a TJ Maxx.

52:02.740 --> 52:03.700
Is that a ladies' store?

52:04.580 --> 52:05.300
It's like a-

52:05.300 --> 52:07.060
It's an everyone's store, Griffin.

52:07.060 --> 52:12.100
The thing I know about it is that they provided most of all the outfits from Sally Jessie

52:12.100 --> 52:12.820
Raphael.

52:12.820 --> 52:13.460
Oh, okay.

52:13.460 --> 52:15.620
So most of her clothing came from TJ Maxx.

52:15.620 --> 52:17.300
A lot of good looks on that show, so.

52:18.100 --> 52:18.340
Yeah.

52:18.340 --> 52:19.300
And those glasses?

52:19.300 --> 52:19.460
Yeah.

52:19.460 --> 52:20.420
Don't mind if I do.

52:20.420 --> 52:21.060
I'll take two.

52:22.100 --> 52:24.900
I'll take four because I want to do it in 20 Does.

52:24.900 --> 52:30.100
Speaking of 20 Does, this has been My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the

52:30.100 --> 52:30.740
modern era.

52:30.740 --> 52:37.940
Thank you so much for listening and for fjording into the next year with us by your side.

52:38.820 --> 52:40.180
So much more good stuff to come.

52:40.180 --> 52:46.180
We had an amazing 2011 because, mainly because of you guys at home listening to us.

52:46.180 --> 52:47.540
We got to do some live shows.

52:47.540 --> 52:48.580
We'll do some more this year.

52:49.780 --> 52:55.540
I'm sure of it, but thank you for all your support and spreading the word to friends

52:55.540 --> 52:56.420
and everything.

52:56.420 --> 52:57.860
It means a lot.

52:57.860 --> 52:58.740
It means a lot to me.

52:58.740 --> 53:00.260
It means a lot to me, I guess.

53:00.260 --> 53:04.020
I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters for letting us use their song, It's

53:04.020 --> 53:09.140
a Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed, which is it still $5?

53:09.140 --> 53:11.940
I saw a tweet somewhere that said it was $5 somewhere.

53:11.940 --> 53:12.740
It was $5.

53:12.740 --> 53:13.460
I don't know.

53:13.460 --> 53:14.900
Let me check while you're doing your announcements.

53:14.900 --> 53:15.540
Just buy it.

53:15.540 --> 53:16.180
No matter what.

53:16.180 --> 53:17.780
It doesn't matter what the price is.

53:17.780 --> 53:18.260
Just buy it.

53:18.260 --> 53:19.220
It doesn't need to be $5.

53:19.220 --> 53:20.420
It's so good.

53:20.420 --> 53:22.260
It's worth upwards of like $8.

53:22.260 --> 53:22.740
Yeah.

53:22.740 --> 53:24.660
And you're, well, what?

53:24.660 --> 53:25.460
Maybe more.

53:25.460 --> 53:25.940
I would say.

53:25.940 --> 53:26.740
I don't know how money works.

53:26.740 --> 53:27.380
I would say it's worth it.

53:27.380 --> 53:30.180
I personally paid $15 for it and have not regretted it.

53:30.180 --> 53:32.580
I bought the CD, and then I bought it on vinyl.

53:32.580 --> 53:35.300
So I spent at least $45 on that record.

53:35.300 --> 53:35.940
Whoa.

53:35.940 --> 53:37.940
For $45 and a lot of credibility.

53:37.940 --> 53:38.420
Yeah.

53:38.420 --> 53:39.780
Just buy a CD already.

53:41.780 --> 53:42.580
It was on Amazon.

53:42.580 --> 53:44.820
It was on the Amazon Streamys.

53:44.820 --> 53:45.380
Oh, yeah, yeah.

53:45.380 --> 53:46.420
They're streamers.

53:46.420 --> 53:51.460
