WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

03:35.560 --> 03:38.100

The guests on podcast don't normally do that cuz I'm fucking Michael Caine

03:43.220 --> 03:48.440
You know, I feel like Conan should step in here with one of his trademark and I'm Andy

03:49.180 --> 03:54.500
Wait, you're both Andy and like that's actually not about Andy. Yeah, I was doing my impression

03:54.500 --> 04:00.820
It's your Louie Anderson impression actually and those two I don't think are this but Andy is within the name of Louie Anderson

04:00.820 --> 04:02.820

05:07.940 --> 05:09.100
podcast

Okay over here

05:17.460 --> 05:21.440
I mean open the door to our new

05:22.140 --> 05:23.940
office based

05:23.940 --> 05:29.700
Fancasts hosted by people who were on the office for a short period of time

05:30.780 --> 05:32.780
It's called

05:33.860 --> 05:39.700
Blunder giggling. Yeah, I got something. Welcome back to blunder giggling

05:40.420 --> 05:42.500

master

05:53.140 --> 05:55.700
we called him props master Dave and

05:56.540 --> 06:02.420
He he made I feel like Griffin is is Arnold Schwarzenegger in that scene in true lies when he's holding

06:03.180 --> 06:09.060
Jamie Lee Curtis dangling from a helicopter and that's the grip that Griffin has on this Kevin voice right now

06:09.060 --> 06:14.340
It's like right there and if he could just pull well the whole point of this was they give me a chance to do my slam

06:14.340 --> 06:16.340
dunk James fader and then he

06:17.700 --> 06:19.700
Spader couldn't make it today

06:23.300 --> 06:27.860
I don't know who this is, but it's not James. It's me James Spader. I was

06:32.180 --> 06:34.180
The coffee shop

06:36.860 --> 06:42.300
That was Jeff Goldblum actually he's next on the show was Jeff Goldblum on the office

06:42.300 --> 06:43.860

06:43.860 --> 06:50.900
Rip the I probably was it seems like I probably would have been. Hey guys, it's me Griffin. Sorry. I love this show

06:53.060 --> 06:59.100
Is the office ready for us we're in a sort of loop right now a kind of vortex

06:59.100 --> 07:05.740
That's gonna be hard for you to James Spader's and you the actor who played Kevin on the office to understand but

07:05.740 --> 07:12.020
I'm going to do you see this orb? That's floating around. That's where the audience is

07:12.180 --> 07:15.980
I'm gonna take us over to smartless Griffin. No, I can't

07:17.620 --> 07:20.620
All right, hold on let me grab the orb fuck it's so hot

07:20.860 --> 07:21.380
Okay

07:21.380 --> 07:26.580
Now here's what I want all of us are just gonna start doing our impression of one of the three hosts

07:26.860 --> 07:32.620
Okay, and I want to see where we like in a perfect world. We'll all pick a different one. Okay, okay

07:32.620 --> 07:37.420
Okay, you ready? I'm gonna count down from three. Can't wait. Should the impression be of your name? So to be a media

07:38.300 --> 07:43.900
You're introducing yourself like and I'm okay. I'm watching Griffin Google the names. No, no, I got it. I'm good. I'm good

07:43.900 --> 07:49.260
I'm good. You're good. He's good. He's good. I didn't have to fellas. All right, you ready? I got him tattooed on my heart

07:49.260 --> 07:53.260
Oh, yeah, three two one. I'm John

07:55.140 --> 07:57.140
It's John Cryer one of them

07:57.140 --> 08:01.580
No, you were looking for Sean Hayes Griffin Sean Hayes

08:01.660 --> 08:07.100
Well, we did you three different ones which that was three different ones. Maybe the guest this week was John Cryer

08:07.260 --> 08:09.260
Yeah, he definitely was on

08:09.980 --> 08:13.780
That podcast at some point, right? I mean, come on. Well, they've had every well

08:13.780 --> 08:19.620
Let me grab the orb and I'm gonna fucking run with it right down the hallway back to the bim-bam studios and wait

08:20.300 --> 08:24.100
Jason Bateman need to eat your orb for fuel. Oh, no, not again

08:24.100 --> 08:29.640
So he's an orb based talent. So this is a that's pretty good. That's pretty good. It's all right

08:29.640 --> 08:34.140
This is an advice podcast. Don't now do Donald Duck. Yeah, let's all break

08:35.980 --> 08:41.540
We love it we love that here we love my Mickey Mouse is getting better, but I still don't have it on yeah

08:41.540 --> 08:44.740
No one does nobody has it on it's a real duck. Hey

08:45.580 --> 08:47.580
advice show

08:47.780 --> 08:49.500
Sorry

08:49.500 --> 08:51.900
About the inconvenience, but you did show up

08:51.900 --> 08:55.540
Don't complain about this because it was your fault for showing up. So early

08:56.220 --> 09:01.100
Time for advice. I love to take my dog for walks in our beautiful Riverside Park

09:01.100 --> 09:04.400
He's a good boy and other dogs and people love to meet him

09:04.400 --> 09:09.380
I'm fine with this as he's super friendly and loves the attention, but I'm socially awkward

09:09.540 --> 09:14.940
So I don't know how to interact with the other people who are petting my dog. Do I pet them too?

09:15.340 --> 09:17.340
Now I look off into the distance

09:17.340 --> 09:24.700
What are some small talk suggestions for people whose dogs have their noses halfway up my dogs, but please help me brothers

09:24.740 --> 09:28.220
That's from mumbling mutt in Memphis. They had to have meant

09:28.940 --> 09:33.060
Do I pet their dog to hear their dog? They could not have meant

09:33.580 --> 09:40.340
Pet their pet the owner had the flesh of the human being who's just trying to live their life next time

09:40.340 --> 09:44.620
Someone says can I pet your dog say can yeah, absolutely. Can't may I pet you?

09:44.620 --> 09:48.420
Yeah, and then my dog will pet me and the circle will be complete

09:49.100 --> 09:52.060
Your dog gets left out. Fuck your dog. Your dog

09:52.660 --> 09:59.620
Guys, we never get questions. This just occurred. We never get questions to start like so my problem is I'm too socially

09:59.620 --> 10:02.860
Well-adjusted I always know what to do in every situation

10:03.340 --> 10:04.700
You don't have a problem

10:04.700 --> 10:10.460
One of those lucky people we it takes three of us to figure out what not one normal person might do. I think

10:10.460 --> 10:15.540
What I would do start petting my dog is I would look away and say I'll give you two a moment

10:19.780 --> 10:22.380
When you're ready, yeah, we have no business you and I

10:23.820 --> 10:25.820
Can you charge money?

10:26.060 --> 10:30.300
$20 I was about to say the words $20 $20 have my dog to pet this

10:30.300 --> 10:32.820
Oh good thing if someone says can I bet your dog say I don't know

10:32.820 --> 10:35.860
Can you and then you don't have to worry about it because they won't keep talking to you

10:35.860 --> 10:39.260
No, I'll have your face with a knife. How about this?

10:39.260 --> 10:44.460
Okay. Yes, you can but you have to promise me that you won't make any wishes promise

10:44.460 --> 10:50.020
I'm gonna make you go really really bad. I've seen some really bad chaotic wishes come out of this dog

10:50.380 --> 10:53.940
Please you have to promise me you're not wishing and you might even think back your mind

10:53.940 --> 10:55.780
Like I wish I could get some Arby's late

10:55.780 --> 11:00.300
Yeah, I think that you've got it airtight and that there is no room for ironic

11:00.700 --> 11:06.580
Classic, but it's this dog. This dog will twist it on you a hundred percent of these don't use up my dog

11:06.580 --> 11:09.660
Which that's the whole reason I bought him. Um

11:10.580 --> 11:12.180
Can you?

11:12.180 --> 11:18.160
Pet the dog too and be like wow that is I've never touched this dog do what to it

11:18.160 --> 11:22.540
That are even thought of that very good the first me how you do that

11:22.540 --> 11:27.060
Show me that again flat hand or closed hand if you were gonna express this dog's anal glands

11:27.060 --> 11:29.060
How would you go about that? Just?

11:29.660 --> 11:33.980
Can I bet your dog? Yeah, as soon as they touch it like haha yours now and run away

11:33.980 --> 11:35.620
You

11:35.620 --> 11:38.780
Were the last one to touch it. He's your problem now

11:40.900 --> 11:42.900
Why do you do you love my dog

11:45.020 --> 11:48.300
You love my dog, okay, what are you asking me for ask him?

11:50.180 --> 11:53.020
This makes him ask the dog say can I pay

11:53.960 --> 11:57.420
Yes, get down there hands and knees and begged

11:58.660 --> 12:02.200
Say it in dog tongue not in your filthy human speech

12:02.200 --> 12:04.400
The dog only let him pay you back

12:06.640 --> 12:08.640
It's a

12:09.000 --> 12:13.280
Yeah, I mean I feel like there's a certain class of people for whom this is not a bug

12:13.280 --> 12:18.920
It's a feature. Yes, where it's like I get to meet lots of other like this is the moment right?

12:18.920 --> 12:25.240
The ice has been broken. This is the moment where they would say like so now we've broken the ice

12:25.240 --> 12:28.520
Let's chat like people who seek out. Yeah, it's like

12:28.520 --> 12:32.120
a it's like people who are into like

12:32.680 --> 12:37.800
Motorcycles and stuff where they just want you to ask them about their motorcycle so that you can ask them like

12:38.280 --> 12:44.920
About their motorcycle and be like good good car people regularly have events because I hear them

12:44.920 --> 12:51.460
Yeah, where they just parked their good cars near each other. Yeah, and then they walk around like pretty good pretty good

12:51.460 --> 12:55.040
Well the nice thing about that, especially if they have a dog too, right?

12:55.040 --> 13:00.900
If you have that shared thing you can focus 100% of the conversation on that thing

13:01.000 --> 13:08.520
Yeah, right. It's when it starts to branch out if someone's like and tell me about you the human attached to this dog

13:08.520 --> 13:14.160
And I'm like, oh no, no, no, but then you've got five like rapid-fire questions

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
about dog care like

13:17.040 --> 13:18.680
What so?

13:18.680 --> 13:23.920
We love dogs, right? Like like but a good conversation starter. I don't talk about dogs. I don't know

13:23.920 --> 13:27.400
I mean you could say like what breed how old are they? Yeah, what's their name?

13:27.400 --> 13:33.280
If you want throw something like looks like there's some like Sheba in there

13:33.280 --> 13:38.440
Don't have to but nobody knows nobody. Yeah, just pick any kind of like classy looking dog

13:38.440 --> 13:44.160
Oh there is there some visual in there and then this person this person is uncomfortable talking to other people Travis

13:44.160 --> 13:50.720
I know that you don't understand this but they're uncomfortable talking to other people and what you want them to do is take a swing

13:50.720 --> 13:55.360
And a miss like to have the awkwardness of getting their dogs breed wrong. No, here's what I'm saying

13:55.360 --> 13:59.080
There is no miss right because here's you're not a dog person

13:59.600 --> 14:03.160
There are two things that dog owners love talking about their dogs breed

14:03.760 --> 14:10.400
The correct yes, you are right good for noticing or I you would think that but actually either way isn't it?

14:10.400 --> 14:13.240
That is the two things that they will talk about

14:13.840 --> 14:18.040
The most is if you get it right or get it wrong now, either way doesn't matter

14:18.040 --> 14:22.360
It doesn't matter if they do pay your dog a compliment like oh, he's such a precious special, baby

14:22.360 --> 14:25.880
Look at those toe beans. I want to eat him up and say like yeah, but

14:26.920 --> 14:28.920
Did you did you see?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Clifford the big red dog movie

14:33.520 --> 14:38.260
Because this dog this dog is good but in that one

14:38.400 --> 14:41.760
what are some of your favorite dog and that one the dog is a

14:41.760 --> 14:49.440
Very unique color and so big that a grown-up can ride on him like a big horse

14:49.440 --> 14:55.680
And you can't do that with my dog. So it's it's a fine. It's a fine dog

14:55.680 --> 14:59.080
It is no Clifford the big red dog now, which now I would

14:59.840 --> 15:03.800
Trade I trade him for Clifford in a heartbeat. I would put this dog above

15:04.280 --> 15:06.280
Beethoven though cuz that dog

15:06.280 --> 15:12.680
Oh and I see that look on your face a lot of people get confused by this Beethoven's is actually about a dog not about the

15:12.680 --> 15:15.000
Composer, I know what you're thinking because you see it's a

15:16.280 --> 15:18.280
Beethoven is the Charles Grodin character

15:19.560 --> 15:22.480
The dog is called Beethoven's dog. Yeah

15:23.640 --> 15:27.760
And strangely Charles Grodin is called Beethoven's owner and no one's quite sure

15:30.200 --> 15:32.360
There's a middleman we haven't pinned down yet

15:32.360 --> 15:36.760
Between Charles Grodin and the dog that connects the two of them. We're not sure

15:36.760 --> 15:39.260
But do you think Turner and Hooch are married in real life?

15:40.200 --> 15:42.200
God, I still miss Gordy every day

15:43.080 --> 15:45.320
they made a series of

15:46.760 --> 15:51.840
Successful films of of it's a big dog man. I don't know what to tell you. He's a big dog

15:51.840 --> 15:58.880
I see not shit over it is that it is 50 though. It's a genius formula. It's 50 said that 50 said man

15:58.880 --> 16:04.300
I love it when when Charles Grodin hates stuff. Yeah, whenever you ever sit here or wine that guy up and see him

16:04.300 --> 16:06.840
Get like really really grumpy. Oh, it's good

16:07.000 --> 16:12.580
It's like a weird manic smile on when he's really mad that if I was there in real person, I'd be terrified

16:12.580 --> 16:15.320
But we watch him. I'm just eating my popcorn and loving it

16:15.400 --> 16:19.240
They put they pointed this out of like check, but he was in Clifford. You remember Clifford?

16:19.240 --> 16:23.780
Yeah with Martin short a little red fucking dog. Yes, Justin. We talked about it

16:23.780 --> 16:28.460
Boy, no, he's a little white boy. That's what it's called Clifford the little white boy

16:29.500 --> 16:31.500
played by the old I

16:32.540 --> 16:38.340
Just realized what was the pitch for the Clifford movie with Martin short it. No, here's the thing

16:38.860 --> 16:41.860
He's a devil. He's a demon child

16:42.460 --> 16:46.020
Played by an adult and also Charles Grodin is there. Sorry

16:46.020 --> 16:52.540
It's it's a skewing to this is too close to anti Martin short dog. We want no I would never I would never abide

16:52.540 --> 17:00.180
I would never is one other question. Yeah, cuz I just discovered that the wiki how I had pulled we have done before and so

17:00.180 --> 17:04.320
I do believe that the wizard is going to be on vacation for this particular episode

17:04.980 --> 17:06.980
Well, how about another question that you know what?

17:08.100 --> 17:12.540
You would have noticed that if they had arrived when they were supposed to arrive. Yeah

17:13.340 --> 17:15.340
Early you would have had this is their fault

17:16.580 --> 17:20.800
My mom and I love to watch shows together. I they actually said like

17:20.800 --> 17:26.880
So I'm putting a little yeah. Hey Justin, how about you don't editorialize? They're still getting to know each other

17:27.800 --> 17:30.500
My mom and I like to watch shows together and recently

17:31.280 --> 17:35.240
What if the question was like my mom and I like to watch shows together?

17:35.600 --> 17:38.520
Can you guys recommend several new shows that you've been enjoying?

17:39.040 --> 17:45.440
No jokes and jokes out of the room. The jokes part is the work to talk about. What if they were just like what shows?

17:45.680 --> 17:50.480
What are you guys watching right now? Don't make bits about it. Don't describe it too much. Just say like the name

17:50.480 --> 17:52.480
I've been watching resident alien. It's good

17:52.640 --> 17:56.720
Do you have friends that when you see them at a party you only talk about the shows?

17:56.720 --> 18:02.800
Yeah, watching. Yeah, and once you once you have gone through all the shows you've been watching you get this feeling like I don't know

18:02.800 --> 18:04.800
This person very well

18:05.440 --> 18:09.680
I'm an adult. Of course. I have those people think we have that much in common

18:09.680 --> 18:13.880
Nothing. I think oh, it's fun when you find out they also like board games or something and it's like well

18:13.880 --> 18:17.680
Have you played this board game and that opens up another 20 to 30 minutes of conversation?

18:17.680 --> 18:23.760
Yeah, and at that point you feel okay about leaving the party you've been there long enough 40 minutes is a good amount of time

18:25.120 --> 18:32.160
Do you want to read more than the first five words of this? Yeah, I was just making some conversation for the podcast. Sorry

18:33.120 --> 18:34.480
um

18:34.480 --> 18:36.480
Let's see now you got me on

18:36.880 --> 18:39.440
Recently, we've been watching the great british bake-off nice

18:39.520 --> 18:43.120
We invited my dad to come watch with us and ever since he's been watching it often

18:43.120 --> 18:47.920
Every time I go downstairs. He's watching it. I heard him stay up till one in the morning last night watching it

18:48.080 --> 18:51.600
He said he couldn't pick me up from school today, and I had to get a ride for a friend

18:51.840 --> 18:54.000
And when I got home, he was watching it

18:55.200 --> 19:00.640
Should I interfere that's from baffled by bake-off in ohio. Oh, he found something. Wow

19:01.600 --> 19:06.240
I miss this feeling. Oh when you find something don't you oh you find a show

19:06.800 --> 19:11.440
And there's so many of them. Yeah, and you could just watch all of them if you want god

19:11.440 --> 19:16.820
I miss that also for it to be great british bake-off in this day and age. Oh the joy the serotonin

19:18.240 --> 19:25.360
You're in for some pivots. You need to be a yeah, but I mean imagine if you got him onto like uh, breaking bad

19:25.600 --> 19:28.800
And it's just like i'm worried about the influences is gonna have on my dad

19:29.040 --> 19:33.360
But great british bake-off the worst thing is gonna happen. You got some more baked goods in the house now

19:33.360 --> 19:40.400
He might start affecting a british accent. Yeah, and we love that it it the thing with breaking bad is it doesn't have

19:40.400 --> 19:42.400
It doesn't have

19:42.480 --> 19:45.620
Sir paul hollywood's just like cerulean

19:46.480 --> 19:51.440
Pools that you just sweat that he just shoots his sex beams out of through the tv screen

19:52.080 --> 19:54.160
Have you not seen the super cuts of all the times?

19:54.480 --> 19:59.920
When uh, walter white finished making a batch and paul hollywood step in and try it and be like, that's a good bake and shake his hand

20:00.560 --> 20:02.560
Do you remember that? Yeah

20:04.560 --> 20:07.680
That crunchy rock and he'd like eat a big rock of it and he'd be like

20:07.680 --> 20:12.160
Like it's a little soggy in the bottom and then he'd be like zeep zop. Zooby dee borp

20:12.320 --> 20:14.480
I don't know what you do when you have done mel

20:15.760 --> 20:18.160
I don't i've not done meth and I don't really know

20:19.520 --> 20:23.840
I don't know what it's like like I can imagine what doing other drugs is like but meth

20:23.920 --> 20:30.000
I assume you just go like bb boop. Zeep zop a leap board and it turns you into like a alien man

20:30.080 --> 20:32.800
It turns you into an andy sandberg character. Yeah, apparently

20:32.800 --> 20:34.320
Yeah

20:34.320 --> 20:37.920
Uh, this is fine as long as it does lead to getting goods baked for you

20:38.080 --> 20:43.840
Because that is the outcome so often with with great british bake often. It's also a good uh, uh,

20:44.000 --> 20:48.240
It's a good onboarding to like taskmaster, which is another good one you want to watch together

20:48.480 --> 20:51.280
No, now you're just doing the thing that we said we wanted to I know

20:53.120 --> 20:55.120
Now there is a okay

20:55.680 --> 20:56.800
There is

20:56.800 --> 21:00.800
A seedy underbelly of possible outcome of him watching too much of this

21:00.800 --> 21:04.240
It's like next family get together grandma brings out a little pie. He takes a bite

21:04.240 --> 21:09.200
He's like soggy bottom and shoves it away, right where he's oh and he's like you call this a scone

21:09.440 --> 21:13.040
And like throws it back in her face like prude did that one time, you know that kind of thing

21:13.040 --> 21:17.040
Or he's like, oh you guys hear about bengate and it's like that. We can't keep bringing up bengate

21:17.120 --> 21:21.040
It's been a long time that kind that's the downside. That's the dark

21:21.760 --> 21:24.160
I will say that I do enjoy

21:25.040 --> 21:27.840
on a whole baked goods less

21:27.840 --> 21:34.160
Because now I know what to look for what they could have been. Yeah, like when I eat a bread

21:34.800 --> 21:36.800
And it's like super chewy

21:37.200 --> 21:42.400
Before I knew anything I was like, oh chewy bread, but now I know like they didn't prove it

21:43.040 --> 21:47.520
They didn't prove it enough. They didn't prove the yeast they improved the existence of bread

21:47.840 --> 21:51.200
No, I i'm glad now because just from watching great British bake-off

21:51.200 --> 21:56.160
I've been able to add the word claggy into my vocabulary and I don't know what it means and I don't think they do either

21:56.160 --> 22:02.320
But it seems like a good way to really put down someone's baking. It's like it's a bit claggy. It's a little stodgy

22:04.400 --> 22:07.040
You don't have to interfere you don't have to intercede just let them enjoy the baking

22:07.360 --> 22:12.000
Maybe set a timer so he doesn't stay up to one o'clock or miss picking up from school. That is worrisome

22:12.240 --> 22:18.960
I I I do. Okay. I love cooking shows. I love great British bake-off. I mean, I love

22:19.500 --> 22:25.200
Zumbo's best desserts. Oh, yeah, I love is it cake sweet genius with ron ben israel?

22:25.200 --> 22:27.200
uh, is it cake

22:28.640 --> 22:30.640
But the other ones I love

22:31.200 --> 22:32.240
and uh

22:32.240 --> 22:37.120
I i'm hard on is it cake because there was a version called eye candy starring josh groban on roku

22:37.680 --> 22:42.400
Or what was a quibi and then it was on right? Anyway, sorry doesn't have anything to do with anything

22:43.120 --> 22:49.920
uh, is it possible your father is obsessed just with the episode where they had to make cake busts of famous people and someone made

22:50.240 --> 22:52.240
nightmare tom delong

22:52.240 --> 22:58.000
I love those shows. I have never felt like I gotta fucking watch the next one. Really?

22:58.800 --> 23:02.800
I've got to see what happens next. It's the reason I didn't watch a long podcast called bacon

23:03.040 --> 23:08.480
Uh, I think of the last two seasons. That's how we feel when we watch it. We have watched uh the season

23:08.960 --> 23:14.960
Uh, like the first season that aired on netflix we watched that shit. Uh, uh, like once a month

23:15.200 --> 23:17.840
We watched that same series over and over again

23:18.640 --> 23:21.120
I feel bad that the wizard let us down this week

23:21.120 --> 23:25.280
Yeah, it is a little sad, isn't it? Do you guys want to learn how to fight with us?

23:25.360 --> 23:27.840
Hey, we're recording this on uh, september first griffin

23:28.800 --> 23:31.120
Don't monthly observance do not do this to me

23:31.760 --> 23:34.880
Aren't you guys curious what kind of month it's going to be in september? I'm so curious

23:35.840 --> 23:37.520
God dang it

23:37.520 --> 23:39.520
Yeah, so we got some special month

23:40.380 --> 23:41.600
observances

23:41.600 --> 23:51.280
To do happy september happy september first everybody. Did you know that this is the month if if you do have a new fall hat?

23:51.520 --> 23:54.640
That you are excited about it is fall hat month

23:55.360 --> 24:00.240
No, it's not fall is here. It's getting colder. So it's time to break out the headgear. It's fall hat month

24:00.880 --> 24:04.080
During fall hat month switch out of the cool weather head protection

24:04.560 --> 24:10.480
And into stylish felt and fabric styles no period on the end of that sentence. No period just laying it all out there

24:10.480 --> 24:12.240
Someone was murdered

24:12.240 --> 24:15.120
Writing that first paragraph and then somebody hopped back in

24:16.160 --> 24:21.440
For the next paragraph hats were probably one of the first items of clothing found among primitive humankind

24:22.080 --> 24:23.280
what

24:23.280 --> 24:25.280
Where are we going with this?

24:25.280 --> 24:30.720
That can't possibly be right when we're walking around with our butt and gooch and privates just out

24:30.800 --> 24:36.560
And someone's like I have to get my hair hidden birds and bugs keep getting in there

24:36.560 --> 24:40.640
Um, so it's fall hat month everybody

24:41.360 --> 24:42.320
and

24:42.320 --> 24:43.280
I guess

24:43.280 --> 24:45.760
Hats have played an impressive role in human history

24:46.060 --> 24:52.240
Presumably us president william henry harrison died shortly after his inaugural dress because he refused to wear a cap on that cold

24:52.240 --> 24:56.000
Nasty day now hold on justice. Was it just if my man

24:56.800 --> 24:58.400
had had

24:58.400 --> 25:05.680
A nice derby on he would still be with us today is what you're saying prove that you can't prove that you assume

25:05.680 --> 25:08.160
If well, but there's no way to prove that

25:08.560 --> 25:12.960
It wasn't a magic hat that a witch gave him and said as long as you wear this you'll never get sick

25:13.440 --> 25:18.720
You don't know unless wait. No, I refuse to unless that that is so nice. But what if it was?

25:18.880 --> 25:22.900
No, no, no, no, i'm closing this what if it was a magic hat they give all precedents

25:24.320 --> 25:30.320
Better breakfast month better breakfast. Fuck you judgmental. You don't know what i'm eating. You don't know maybe I can't get better

25:30.320 --> 25:36.160
Hey, you can always get better. I'm looking at a picture. It looks like it has seven banana slices and some chia seeds

25:36.400 --> 25:38.400
No, thank you. That's it

25:38.800 --> 25:45.200
No, thank you any breakfast be better than that can't be it that can't be i've seen pictures of a balanced breakfast

25:45.280 --> 25:50.720
And it didn't contain chia seeds it contained frosted flakes a glass of milk and orange juice for some reason

25:51.040 --> 25:52.640
Yeah, it toasts

25:52.640 --> 25:56.900
If I ate a balanced breakfast as recommended by cereal commercials

25:56.900 --> 26:03.620
I would be on the toilet until lunch time. It's so much fucking food

26:04.180 --> 26:06.340
It's so much food. It's milk

26:06.980 --> 26:11.540
And orange juice you want me to the orange juice also it is in a pitcher

26:12.020 --> 26:18.100
Did I did I need did I wait? Did I take the extra minute to get out a pitcher and fill my kids?

26:18.660 --> 26:24.180
Pitcher with it's better breakfast month decant your juice for your dirt bad kids

26:24.180 --> 26:26.340
Decant your juice and give your kids

26:26.980 --> 26:33.540
These fucking hard hardened charcoal tablets to enjoy with their seven banana slices

26:34.340 --> 26:39.700
Can we go back to uh as long as we're talking about can we go back to original fruit loop recipe, please?

26:40.100 --> 26:44.820
Just before they use the art back when they use the artificial colors and the artificial sweeteners

26:44.900 --> 26:48.660
I like the old school tricks recipe as well, please. I'm listen

26:48.660 --> 26:51.780
I'm an adult now and I would like to make these decisions for you. They did

26:51.780 --> 26:59.220
They don't okay. You're saying a lot of wild stuff. They did go back to the original tricks. Look people hated the no artificial colors

26:59.220 --> 27:04.180
Thank you. So you're covered there. Thank you. Awesome. Save your photos. Save your photos month

27:04.900 --> 27:06.580
Save your photos month

27:06.580 --> 27:09.140
Now in case of I guess a storm

27:09.780 --> 27:15.220
That comes to try to take your photos away. I guess put them in the cloud that that one doesn't feel like it needs

27:15.780 --> 27:19.060
That won't take me. I don't have the urgency of spending a month doing this

27:19.060 --> 27:27.060
Um, I'm almost certain we've talked about international update your resume month, which like for us would be kind of I don't want

27:27.620 --> 27:33.140
I don't want the two of you to ever update your resumes because that would affect me

27:33.780 --> 27:36.740
That would have implications for me and my life

27:37.300 --> 27:39.780
If I find out the two of you are updating your resume

27:40.340 --> 27:46.020
I would probably quit first just so you don't get the satisfaction of pulling the rug

27:46.020 --> 27:50.100
Just so you don't get the satisfaction of pulling the rug out from me

27:50.820 --> 27:58.200
Well good news. I can tell you this personally. Yeah, unless the employer is interested in a decade of podcast experience

27:58.740 --> 28:03.540
I don't have a lot go unless they're like, well, yeah. Oh we see here that back from

28:04.080 --> 28:06.740
2007 to 2009 you worked at best buy

28:07.360 --> 28:12.500
Interesting. Yes, please be the manager of this big company. I don't see that happen

28:12.500 --> 28:16.660
I'm not bringing a lot to the table outside of what i'm currently doing looks

28:16.980 --> 28:20.900
Looks like I haven't updated my resume in about eight years

28:21.300 --> 28:25.940
So I really don't know if I have I don't have one. I have an acting resume

28:26.580 --> 28:28.980
from my time upon the boards

28:29.460 --> 28:37.300
I have a curriculum verite those I use for my professorships special skills being really good at acting

28:38.020 --> 28:40.020
That's not one but that's a secret for you

28:40.020 --> 28:43.940
You can put that as a special skill in anything being good at doing this job

28:44.820 --> 28:46.820
um, baby safety month

28:46.820 --> 28:49.700
Gotta take that serious. That should be every month

28:50.420 --> 28:57.700
It's hugely a problem. That is a massive the idea that you have been putting off making your home safe for your baby

28:58.020 --> 29:00.020
and then you see like

29:00.100 --> 29:06.260

Uh, I don't have enough manacles for everybody. Uh, I didn't expect goro to have so many arms. That's on me

32:51.140 --> 32:52.980
So i'm one I am one set short

32:52.980 --> 32:59.640
I thought I could just do two sets of manacles on goro, but I kind of have to do a crisscross applesauce

33:02.020 --> 33:05.620
That's a good question justin do you go side to side or you go exes

33:05.620 --> 33:12.580
Yeah, if he could still go up and down and squish things, that's not good. Right? Yeah. Yeah, so speaking of

33:13.380 --> 33:17.140
Goro bondage play bombas is their mission is simple

33:17.780 --> 33:22.180
They make the most comfortable clothes ever and match every item sold with an equal item donated

33:22.260 --> 33:25.220
So I bet goro is a sub though. So when you buy

33:26.340 --> 33:29.380
You are also giving to someone in need

33:30.100 --> 33:33.940
Bombas designed their socks shirts and underwear to be the clothes. You can't wait to put on every day

33:33.940 --> 33:38.580
Everything they make is soft seamless tagless and has a cozy feel

33:39.140 --> 33:41.780
Unlike do you guys think sub-zero on scorpion ever kiss?

33:42.500 --> 33:48.420
And did you know that socks underwear and t-shirts are the three most requested clothing items at home? Are they related?

33:48.740 --> 33:52.980
Are they are there's also smoke and there's like a snake one reptile

33:53.060 --> 33:57.460
That's why bombas donates one for every item you buy so far bombas customers

33:57.460 --> 34:00.980
Like you have helped donate over 50 million items of essential clothing

34:00.980 --> 34:06.340
We're kind of the same clothing. So you have the same size. Yeah, are they related?

34:07.380 --> 34:09.380

But what if there's pumpkin spice obviously, but what is it? What are the other drinks justin that they're partnering the button real spice experience with

40:58.400 --> 41:03.600
I like that one and it's a fan that one's a fan favorite. Yeah, I get nasty for that one. If you keep bringing something back four times

41:03.600 --> 41:10.080
Then I would hope that fans enjoy it because otherwise I don't know what you're doing with all that

41:10.480 --> 41:14.080
Pumpkin cold brew. Oh shit. I could be buying pumpkin flavored beer right now

41:30.640 --> 41:33.920
What do you mean to open up the reserves?

41:35.120 --> 41:37.680
No, it's like a fancier coffee. It's like a better fan

They have better coffee and they're just like we could be giving you better coffee than what we have

41:41.840 --> 41:46.160
But we're holding this back. You dirty birds. I mean, it's a commodity right supply and demand

42:53.600 --> 42:55.600
um

42:56.160 --> 43:01.760
Hardee's is making a beer. I mean what usual the usual what hardy's making beer is fun

43:02.800 --> 43:09.040
Yeah, hardy's is teamed with southern grist brewing company on a strawberry biscuit ale. So it's like you ever

43:09.680 --> 43:15.920
I eat a strawberry biscuit at hardy's and think god. I wish this get me wrecked. Yeah, dude. Now your dreams can come true

43:16.560 --> 43:21.520
Yeah, drink a delicious beer. That is actually a biscuit from hardy's all mushed up and fermented

43:21.520 --> 43:23.520
delicious

43:23.620 --> 43:29.380
Does anyone else on this call or in the world have the experience of it becomes fall you get really excited you buy like fall beer

43:29.860 --> 43:35.300
Uh, so you buy a bunch of it and then you have like six of them in a week or whatever and you're like

43:35.380 --> 43:37.380
Oh, i'm tired of this already

43:37.540 --> 43:42.260
And then those pumpkin beers sit in your fridge for many months until it gets to be like summer and you're like well

43:42.340 --> 43:44.580
I haven't been to the store in a while and i'm out of here

43:44.740 --> 43:48.980
So you crack open like a pumpkin beer in the middle of july and you're like, oh, this actually is terrible

43:48.980 --> 43:56.340
I hate this. Yeah, but then fall comes around again and you're like, oh hell yeah pumpkin beer season. Yeah, that's sort of just the

43:57.060 --> 43:58.420
futility of

43:58.420 --> 43:59.860
Of it all, huh?

43:59.860 --> 44:01.060
Yeah, man

44:01.060 --> 44:05.380
There's an artemis moon donut at crispy cream delicious. Yeah

44:05.460 --> 44:10.020
It's a one day special for the to celebrate the planned launch of artemis one

44:10.420 --> 44:17.300
Can you and they fucking post I have beef with nazza because I get my kid I get my class together

44:17.300 --> 44:22.740
And sit in front of the big tv screen and I say they're about to shoot that shit right up into outer space

44:22.820 --> 44:25.720
It's got nobody on it, which is wasteful

44:26.420 --> 44:28.580
It's like do you see cars on the highway?

44:29.220 --> 44:32.020
With no one in them emissions much

44:32.740 --> 44:38.100
And I was my class was psyched and then the last minute they're like something was wrong with one of the engines

44:38.180 --> 44:43.460
So we didn't do it and it's like no one's in the rocket if it does a big explode

44:43.460 --> 44:49.780
My class is going to talk like remember that forever and talk about that. I didn't know there was no one in it

44:50.100 --> 44:56.820
And that actually explains to me why they were so candid about the engine problems because you know, if that's a manned mission

44:56.900 --> 45:01.060
They don't just say like we had engine they were this close

45:01.540 --> 45:03.700
Right, we almost shuffled a few

45:04.020 --> 45:10.420
There was a big whoopsie that devin should have caught and he didn't and if that shit had gone up there

45:10.420 --> 45:14.580
It would have been yikes city end of astronauts

45:16.020 --> 45:19.780
Imagine being an astronaut who's like on that and they're like, yeah, we had a lot of mechanical issues

45:19.860 --> 45:24.260
But it'll be fine by tomorrow get ready to go and you're like what no

45:25.700 --> 45:31.780
It is still kind of hilarious. I understand what happens. I'm basically i've watched a lot of different movies

45:32.340 --> 45:38.980
But it is kind of funny that we're gonna black like blast a rocket into the sky. It's cost like billions of dollars

45:38.980 --> 45:44.820
To get to this point and then it starts raining and everyone's like fuck

45:47.380 --> 45:49.380
No, no, no

45:49.700 --> 45:55.300
No, no, sorry. Sorry. We tried to oppose your will with our incredible brains. You win

45:55.460 --> 45:58.180
Is this is it bad for the rocket? No, it's just

45:58.580 --> 46:01.460
We wanted that morning glow on it when we took all the pictures

46:01.940 --> 46:07.860
And we've like been staging it we put a bunch of like doilies around it and stuff rocket get wet. It looks

46:07.860 --> 46:09.860
It looks so dumb

46:13.620 --> 46:17.060
The decals get loose it's it everything gets wrinkled

46:18.020 --> 46:20.420
There's a lot of steam when the rocket goes

46:21.700 --> 46:27.460
The wet rock they do that they do that if for takeoff, but they don't do it for landing

46:27.620 --> 46:30.340
Yeah, they're never like it's raining go around

46:30.340 --> 46:35.160
Oh my god, we're gonna reroute you to phoenix

46:38.660 --> 46:44.660
Madagascar is dry. Take a left go to the ocean people are watching

46:47.060 --> 46:48.020
Be careful

46:48.020 --> 46:52.340
There's a reason they don't fish the rockets out of the ocean once they do go splash smash

46:52.740 --> 46:56.580
And that's because they look so fucking stupid. Well, yeah like a wet penis

46:56.580 --> 47:00.980
Is yeah, it's a big stupid. It's so stupid. It's just stupid

47:01.940 --> 47:06.100
My first job out of college. I ran art groups for teens out of necessity

47:06.340 --> 47:11.060
I trained myself into a lot of habits to help maintain boundaries and dissuade unwanted attention

47:11.380 --> 47:17.460
One of these things included if I ever need to bend over I did it in the most unflattering way possible years later

47:17.460 --> 47:19.460
I still have this habit

47:19.620 --> 47:24.820
Problem is I now have a serious girlfriend. I'm afraid I've trained my body to move in this not erotic way forever

47:24.820 --> 47:31.800
This is brothers. What can I do to drop this habit and learn to bend over sexy? That's for rescue in rochester

47:33.700 --> 47:36.420
It takes your it takes a long time to train that out of you

47:36.820 --> 47:41.620
Take it from me. I've had to work so hard to drain every bit of sexy out of my body

47:42.020 --> 47:45.140
Yeah took years it for me. It just took um

47:46.100 --> 47:48.360
Oh god, oh travis dropped this camera

47:48.360 --> 47:53.640
Yeah, wow, you really dropped it huh

47:54.600 --> 47:57.640
Wow, I feel like i'm watching a colonoscopy for a robot

47:59.880 --> 48:02.680
Wow, you dropped the shit out of that tribe you still haven't fixed it

48:03.560 --> 48:07.480
He's still trying to fix it. It might have come unconnected disconnected. Wow

48:11.560 --> 48:13.560
Well

48:13.560 --> 48:16.840
We don't need to see you I guess. Um, yeah, we just won't film the rest

48:16.840 --> 48:22.200
Okay, i'm curious. I wish i'd gotten a little bit more maybe you could share screen of a picture of you

48:24.760 --> 48:31.160
If we could have gotten some description of what your unsexy bend over method looks like if that would have been hugely helpful

48:31.240 --> 48:36.200
Yeah, I think we can just take the bend and snap from legally blonde and do the antithesis of that

48:36.280 --> 48:39.400
Yeah, so it's like kind of your squinching down to the side for sure

48:39.480 --> 48:43.640
What if you just like your hip is going one way your knees go the other you just fall to the ground

48:43.640 --> 48:49.240
And you have to stand back up and then but see standing back up in a non-state like what's that look like?

48:52.280 --> 48:56.200
The amount of overthinking that went into this is truly

48:56.900 --> 48:58.040
humbling

48:58.040 --> 49:02.600
Like I thought I thought that I overthink everything but to be like i'm an art teacher

49:03.000 --> 49:06.220
I can't possibly bend over a sexy way if I drop a paintbrush

49:06.680 --> 49:10.200
So i'm gonna develop this new I sort of twist my body

49:10.200 --> 49:15.100
Sideways a little bit and then I do if golem was picking up a paintbrush

49:15.100 --> 49:17.500
Yeah, I go down gorilla style baby

49:17.820 --> 49:23.180
And then I get the paintbrush and I stand up so fast that no one could ever look at me and be like that's oh

49:23.420 --> 49:25.420
That's an erotic pose right there

49:26.140 --> 49:30.940
Perfect. I love it. How do you bring it back? The question is not how to undo the sexy. They've done that

49:31.420 --> 49:36.540
How do you bring it back? Oh, thank you. Justin. Thank you for screen sharing a picture of me talking to a microphone now

49:36.540 --> 49:39.500
You did pick in my big beard face. Yeah

49:39.500 --> 49:45.420
Uh, i'm sorry trap. I should have measured your beard length against your current to find the exact

49:46.140 --> 49:48.780
Image or maybe you can stop being such a clumsy

49:49.420 --> 49:51.980
Fuck and keep your camera on your desk

49:52.700 --> 49:58.220
Well, right. Okay. Um, I turned it off because I feared I was too sexy and it would distract you guys

49:58.780 --> 50:00.780
um, but now

50:00.860 --> 50:06.380
You've made me feel terrible about it and I don't know how to turn with so the weird thing is the camera light is on

50:06.860 --> 50:08.860
So it wants to be on

50:08.860 --> 50:09.660
You got it

50:09.660 --> 50:13.980
I'm going to go over to bnh.com and see if they got manuals and I will I will get back

50:13.980 --> 50:17.100
All right, and then all how about this you guys do that and i'll do the show

50:18.860 --> 50:23.260
You guys go do some other thing and i'll do the show people are listening to right I got the orb right in front of me

50:23.740 --> 50:30.060
It's not it's not my fault griffin. We weren't ready. Okay, right? Travis would have had his camera in the perfect place

50:30.540 --> 50:36.060
So secure. Yeah, all of this would be all set up already. Yeah, right. We weren't ready for so the

50:36.060 --> 50:41.020
The bend snap, you know, look at that picture, you know about yeah about how to bend over sexy

50:41.100 --> 50:47.660
A lot of people like you're eating a mouse won't tell you wow that you have got to squish your butt cheeks together

50:49.020 --> 50:50.540
With your hands

50:50.540 --> 50:51.740
Oh

50:51.740 --> 50:57.100
To get a sexy bend going to do a sexy bend if you can't squish your butt cheeks together using just butt

50:57.580 --> 51:01.980
Muscle, it's okay to use your I i'll write you a note that says it's okay

51:01.980 --> 51:07.260
Until you make it i'll write a note that says it's okay for you to use your hands to squish your butt cheeks together

51:07.420 --> 51:12.860
Like a doctor's note and so when your your partner is like, why did you do that?

51:13.260 --> 51:14.380
I mean it looked great

51:14.380 --> 51:17.420
But did you need to use your hands you can show them the note that says

51:17.660 --> 51:21.660
Griffin said it's okay for me to do it like that. Griffin said it's actually very important and fine

51:21.740 --> 51:26.460
I would also say, uh, you know, what makes everything sexier. What's that doing it a little slower?

51:26.940 --> 51:31.020
So the slower you can bend over and stand back up the slower you can do it

51:31.020 --> 51:37.420
Yeah, this also more eye contact so slow lots of eye contact and now that's gonna be hard if they're behind you

51:37.500 --> 51:40.140
You gotta turn behind so slow slow

51:40.700 --> 51:47.500
Quick quick slow. Yeah, no, no, no slow quick slow slow quick and the whole time just push them

51:48.700 --> 51:53.100
What push them together with your hands push them together with your hands eye contact no matter where they are in the room

51:53.340 --> 51:56.620
If they move around you stay locked in on them the whole time

51:56.620 --> 52:01.100
And when when you're picking the thing up you have to say oh there it is

52:01.660 --> 52:04.860
Every time make sure you see like, okay

52:05.100 --> 52:10.140
Lock into the object first and then make eye contact because you don't want to whiff on it a couple times

52:10.140 --> 52:14.540
Because then you're gonna be like, oh there. No. Oh there. What? Oh, there it is

52:14.700 --> 52:17.500
Can you tear your pants and make it seem like an accident?

52:18.860 --> 52:20.860
Oh to get it all out

52:21.660 --> 52:23.180
Yeah

52:23.180 --> 52:26.700
How do you sorry? How do you mean tear your pants and make it look like an accident?

52:26.700 --> 52:33.180
Well, you're already holding your butt. Yeah. Yeah. Well, they're gonna know they're gonna think you tore your pants with your hands, which is not

52:34.060 --> 52:37.420
Sexy. Oh, can you hold your butt and then move your butt like it's talking

52:37.500 --> 52:43.020
You know that clip of uh, linny cravitz on stage and then he kind of does like a little dip

52:43.420 --> 52:49.180
And then and his crap his leather his leather pants split and his like whole hog

52:49.180 --> 52:53.520
springs forth as if it's been in prison this whole time like

52:56.080 --> 52:59.520
It's so it's so tight inside of linny cravitz's pants

53:01.040 --> 53:05.440
I just had to get out of there like something like that. I'm the real prince

53:06.800 --> 53:08.800
What it's like the man in the iron mask

53:10.880 --> 53:12.000
Yeah

53:12.000 --> 53:14.320
I don't know why that was so hard for for me to get
