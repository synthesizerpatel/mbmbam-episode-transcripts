00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.640
Hello, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Being Advised Show. For the modern era,

00:48.640 --> 00:53.680
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:53.680 --> 00:56.720
I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30 Griffin McElroy.

00:56.720 --> 01:01.520
I was thinking about how around Halloween, when I do that hello,

01:01.520 --> 01:03.840
I might stop before I get to the oh.

01:04.400 --> 01:07.120
Oh yeah, I'd be like, imagine it's Halloween okay.

01:07.120 --> 01:07.780
Halloween...

01:10.000 --> 01:13.520
Yeah, no I'm definitely scared because I'm seeing,

01:13.520 --> 01:17.440
I'm seeing the hell demons, I'm seeing skeletons and you know, blood volcanoes,

01:17.440 --> 01:22.480
and I'm getting real uh quite spooked and it's June, so how could you do this to me now?

01:22.480 --> 01:27.480
I am literally vibrating with anticipation

01:28.440 --> 01:31.640
because we got ourselves a watch, Jurassic World,

01:31.640 --> 01:36.120
Lost World Kingdom of Dinosaurs coming out.

01:36.120 --> 01:37.360
Who knows when?

01:37.360 --> 01:42.360
That's what makes this watch so exciting.

01:42.440 --> 01:44.960
I don't even know when the movie comes out.

01:44.960 --> 01:49.680
We've all seen the posters that just say, Jeff's in it.

01:49.680 --> 01:50.520
Yeah.

01:50.520 --> 01:53.720
Everybody's so excited about Jeff coming back,

01:53.720 --> 01:55.200
doing his thing.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.960
Jeff's in this one, folks.

01:56.960 --> 01:58.600
He's in it, confirmed.

01:58.600 --> 02:00.400
Yeah, we got a lot of sort of classic stuff in here.

02:00.400 --> 02:03.160
We got Jeff in it, and he says the great line

02:03.160 --> 02:07.200
about how everything can get all fucked up sometimes,

02:07.200 --> 02:09.440
and Richard Schiff comes back.

02:09.440 --> 02:12.680
He gets chomped by another Tyrannosaurus Rex.

02:12.680 --> 02:15.040
Well, he got robotic legs after he was chomped

02:15.040 --> 02:16.360
in half the first time.

02:16.360 --> 02:19.220
Yeah, his top half lived inside the T-Rex for a long time,

02:19.220 --> 02:21.600
but then he got out of the Sarlacc pit like Boba Fett,

02:21.600 --> 02:23.520
and then they gave him new legs,

02:23.520 --> 02:25.060
and then he shows up to the park like,

02:25.060 --> 02:26.320
I think I'm really gonna be able to,

02:26.320 --> 02:27.960
and then a pterodactyl comes, picks him up,

02:27.960 --> 02:29.840
drops him in a T-Rex's mouth,

02:29.840 --> 02:33.440
and it's supposed to be funny, I guess, that he dies.

02:33.440 --> 02:35.640
So Jeff wasn't in the first one.

02:35.640 --> 02:36.480
Wasn't in the first Jurassic World.

02:36.480 --> 02:38.000
Well, it's hard to say

02:38.000 --> 02:39.780
because there was a lot of jungle in there.

02:39.780 --> 02:41.400
And there was a lot of wide shots.

02:41.400 --> 02:44.740
He might have been hiding in the forest living his new life.

02:44.740 --> 02:46.480
Jeff wasn't in that one.

02:46.480 --> 02:48.560
Jeff's in two.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.240
Jeff's in Jurassic World.

02:50.240 --> 02:51.760
It done fell back.

02:51.760 --> 02:54.960
But the thing that I found out today,

02:54.960 --> 02:59.640
Jeff is also the tutorial voice in Jurassic World Evolution.

02:59.640 --> 03:01.800
The video game is Dr. Ian Malcolm.

03:01.800 --> 03:05.300
So he just reignited the passion for the role, I guess,

03:05.300 --> 03:07.920
and is willing to just do it.

03:07.920 --> 03:10.600
Jurassic World brand toilet paper is very good.

03:10.600 --> 03:11.720
Take it from me.

03:11.720 --> 03:12.640
Life finds a way.

03:12.640 --> 03:16.280
And so he's doing a commercial for it.

03:16.280 --> 03:19.920
Hi, I'm popular actor Jeff Goldblum from apartments.com.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.120
If you have to lay an egg,

03:22.120 --> 03:26.280
and then he looks at the camera for a minute straight,

03:26.280 --> 03:28.320
and then that's the end of the commercial.

03:28.320 --> 03:29.760
He says, if you have to lay an egg,

03:29.760 --> 03:33.140
and then he slowly lives up the TP.

03:33.140 --> 03:33.980
Here's the thing.

03:33.980 --> 03:37.080
I think what happened was he did that Thor movie.

03:37.080 --> 03:38.600
He did the Thor movie and he was like,

03:38.600 --> 03:42.800
you know what, I like being in these big movies.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.200
I missed being in the movies.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.160
These apartment.com ads are very good.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.200
And I am making a good amount of money.

03:49.680 --> 03:52.960
Jeff Goldblum plays a character called Brad Bellflower

03:52.960 --> 03:55.160
in the apartments.com ads.

03:55.160 --> 03:56.340
And we were watching one.

03:56.340 --> 03:58.860
This campaign has been ongoing for several years now.

03:58.860 --> 04:00.040
We were watching one and Siddy said,

04:00.040 --> 04:02.200
why does it say his name is Brad?

04:02.200 --> 04:03.480
I said, well, and she said,

04:03.480 --> 04:05.360
I thought he was just playing Jeff Goldblum.

04:05.360 --> 04:08.000
I said, you thought he was just playing Jeff Goldblum,

04:08.000 --> 04:09.840
popular actor, showing people

04:09.840 --> 04:12.100
how to find the best apartments for them?

04:12.100 --> 04:14.400
Is that something you would trust Jeff Goldblum to do?

04:14.400 --> 04:15.980
And the answer of course is,

04:15.980 --> 04:18.120
yes, in a heartbeat.

04:18.120 --> 04:20.320
Yeah, that's fair because the Travago guy

04:20.320 --> 04:22.880
isn't playing himself, I assume.

04:22.880 --> 04:23.760
No, that's not true.

04:23.760 --> 04:25.320
His name's David Travago.

04:25.320 --> 04:26.960
Oh, can I tell you,

04:26.960 --> 04:30.320
I got two theories about Jurassic World, Lost World.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.280
You don't want to talk about Travago guy?

04:32.280 --> 04:34.760
No, well, my theory number one is he's in it

04:35.640 --> 04:37.200
as Travago guy.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.000
I don't like how when you search

04:39.000 --> 04:42.560
for any hotel accommodations on Travago,

04:42.560 --> 04:45.560
the first result is always my guest room

04:45.560 --> 04:48.000
and it's a picture of the Travago guy

04:48.000 --> 04:49.720
trying to get you to stay at his crib.

04:49.720 --> 04:52.320
The picture of the bed has him lying in the bed,

04:52.320 --> 04:54.120
kind of like head up on one hand,

04:54.120 --> 04:56.240
you know, on his elbow kind of thing.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.920
Harris Tassel as if you've just awoken him from a nap.

04:58.920 --> 05:00.160
And there's a big paragraph in there

05:00.160 --> 05:02.180
about how he lost all his shirts in a fire

05:02.180 --> 05:04.960
and that's why he's not wearing any of the pics.

05:04.960 --> 05:06.200
That's weird.

05:06.200 --> 05:07.320
It's so strange.

05:07.320 --> 05:10.280
But it is a good way to demonstrate the size of the bed

05:10.280 --> 05:13.320
to give me some sort of context.

05:13.320 --> 05:16.220
My house is four Travago guys tall.

05:16.220 --> 05:17.060
Yeah, right?

05:17.060 --> 05:19.840
And there's plenty of room for you to stretch out

05:19.840 --> 05:22.760
in my one and a half Travago guy size bed.

05:22.760 --> 05:26.000
Here's my theory about the Jurassic World lost world.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.800
One, they're finally gonna show the dinosaurs in this one.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.080
This one, oh, it's gonna have them.

05:31.080 --> 05:31.920
Been waiting.

05:31.920 --> 05:33.080
I think we're finally gonna see them.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.760
Unfair that Richard Schiff got chopped in half off screen.

05:35.760 --> 05:36.600
Yes.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.440
I needed to see that to finish.

05:38.440 --> 05:39.280
I have to.

05:39.280 --> 05:40.140
Ha ha!

05:40.140 --> 05:42.860
Number two, my theory is at the end,

05:42.860 --> 05:45.520
it's gonna pull back, camera pulls back,

05:45.520 --> 05:47.720
and all of that was inside a dome

05:47.720 --> 05:50.840
with super intelligent dinosaurs looking in

05:50.840 --> 05:52.840
and saying like, yes, our experiment

05:52.840 --> 05:55.960
to breed extinct humans is going very well.

05:55.960 --> 05:57.520
Yeah, into phase one.

05:57.520 --> 05:58.660
Onto phase two.

05:58.660 --> 05:59.500
Yes.

05:59.500 --> 06:00.440
Let's get Chris Pratt up here.

06:00.440 --> 06:01.280
Let's get him nude.

06:01.280 --> 06:05.620
Your thing would make more sense, I think, Travis.

06:05.620 --> 06:08.320
Your thing would be more logical

06:08.320 --> 06:12.560
if the humans were the animals in this world.

06:12.560 --> 06:14.240
It would make more sense than the fact

06:14.240 --> 06:16.040
that they done did the park again.

06:16.040 --> 06:17.400
They did it again.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.080
They did it again.

06:19.080 --> 06:22.060
You know how in the first one, Jeff is like,

06:22.060 --> 06:25.400
this is so whack, and everybody's like,

06:25.400 --> 06:26.680
hey, Jeff, can you calm down?

06:26.680 --> 06:28.280
We're just really excited to see dinosaurs.

06:28.280 --> 06:29.960
And I think at that point, even the audience is like,

06:29.960 --> 06:31.560
hey, don't listen to him.

06:31.560 --> 06:33.160
I really wanna see a dinosaur.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.920
And then when everybody starts getting eaten,

06:34.920 --> 06:36.600
he's like, let's go faster.

06:36.600 --> 06:39.000
Like, he's like, yeah, I told you so.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.720
Wouldn't it be rad, I haven't seen the film,

06:40.720 --> 06:42.480
wouldn't it be rad in this one if he was like,

06:42.480 --> 06:44.280
super jazzed about it?

06:44.280 --> 06:45.640
Like, he's just like.

06:45.640 --> 06:48.280
My old friend's dinosaurs.

06:48.280 --> 06:49.680
Are you shitting me?

06:49.680 --> 06:51.600
Hell yeah, I'm so stoked.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.440
Who wouldn't wanna see a fucking dinosaur?

06:53.440 --> 06:54.520
This is incredible.

06:54.520 --> 06:55.760
This is amazing.

06:55.760 --> 06:57.400
The claws, the teeth.

06:57.400 --> 07:00.400
He sees a big pile of dookies, like, that's a lot of shit.

07:00.400 --> 07:01.640
I love it.

07:01.640 --> 07:02.480
I like it this time.

07:02.480 --> 07:03.660
I'm very excited.

07:03.660 --> 07:05.680
My roommate and I do not get along.

07:05.680 --> 07:06.820
Our relationship went downhill

07:06.820 --> 07:08.920
when she bought a Jenga board.

07:08.920 --> 07:11.560
We're gonna talk about it, just wait.

07:11.560 --> 07:13.560
She'd ask casually from time to time,

07:13.560 --> 07:15.000
usually I would be cooking dinner

07:15.000 --> 07:17.080
when I'd play Jenga with her.

07:17.080 --> 07:18.760
I have a nine to five job,

07:18.760 --> 07:21.380
but I'm often at home at varying times.

07:21.380 --> 07:24.300
So I was hesitant to make plans with her to play Jenga

07:24.300 --> 07:26.080
that I probably couldn't keep.

07:26.080 --> 07:28.040
I told her just to ask me when I'm at home

07:28.040 --> 07:30.920
and not cooking and I will play Jenga with her.

07:30.920 --> 07:32.980
The shit really hit the wall one night.

07:34.360 --> 07:36.440
I came home and all the lights in the house were off.

07:36.440 --> 07:38.800
I walked in the living room looking for the light switch

07:38.800 --> 07:40.520
when I heard something moving in the dark.

07:40.520 --> 07:42.280
When I turned on the lights, it was my roommate

07:42.280 --> 07:45.040
playing Jenga by herself in the dark.

07:45.040 --> 07:48.320
I don't really want to play Jenga with her anymore,

07:48.320 --> 07:50.260
but I feel like she might light my room on fire

07:50.260 --> 07:51.520
if I don't indulge her.

07:51.520 --> 07:52.760
What do I do?

07:52.760 --> 07:54.320
That's from Gmail.

07:54.320 --> 07:57.160
So I was very thrown by this question

07:57.160 --> 07:58.840
because I've never heard anybody in my life

07:58.840 --> 08:00.240
say a Jenga board.

08:00.240 --> 08:02.760
I don't know even what that could be

08:02.760 --> 08:04.840
and I thought maybe they meant a Ouija board.

08:04.840 --> 08:06.200
And just fucked up the worst.

08:06.200 --> 08:07.040
Yeah, but no.

08:07.040 --> 08:07.860
And just fucked up the words,

08:07.860 --> 08:10.120
but it got weirder because I've also never heard somebody

08:10.120 --> 08:11.800
say they're going to play Ouija.

08:11.800 --> 08:12.680
I've never heard that.

08:12.680 --> 08:14.400
So I think that it is a Jenga.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.520
I don't, but a Jenga board.

08:16.520 --> 08:18.520
I mean, I don't know what I would call it instead,

08:18.520 --> 08:21.240
but it's certainly, there's nothing board like

08:21.240 --> 08:25.040
the Jenga play set, I guess.

08:25.040 --> 08:25.880
I don't know.

08:25.880 --> 08:26.960
It's certainly not a board.

08:26.960 --> 08:30.920
I also, not to nitpick a little bit,

08:30.920 --> 08:34.280
I've also never heard the phrase the shit hit the wall.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.800
Though I get, listen, through context,

08:36.800 --> 08:38.840
I totally understand what it means.

08:38.840 --> 08:40.200
Unless it's being used literally.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.680
We missed the fan.

08:41.680 --> 08:44.040
We threw it at the fan and the fan moved

08:44.040 --> 08:45.400
and then it hit the wall.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.380
Because the lights were off.

08:46.380 --> 08:47.220
Because the lights were off.

08:47.220 --> 08:48.540
Because they were in the dark.

08:48.540 --> 08:53.540
They were using the Jenga in the dark to hone their senses.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.720
You don't need your eyes, your sight,

08:56.720 --> 08:58.480
in order to get a really good Jenga going.

08:58.480 --> 09:00.160
You just need to sort of feel it out.

09:00.160 --> 09:01.640
And the more you can kind of hone that,

09:01.640 --> 09:04.080
I think the better a player you're going to be.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.920
So I wouldn't be too freaked out about that.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.900
They're probably not going to set your room on fire.

09:07.900 --> 09:09.680
They are, I guess the worst case scenario,

09:09.680 --> 09:11.840
going to kick your ass so bad at Jenga so bad

09:11.840 --> 09:14.000
that you'll never be able to leave the house again.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.920
Seems like the more likely scenario.

09:16.920 --> 09:18.280
Would you guys play Jenga right?

09:18.280 --> 09:21.280
If I was like, you want to play some Jenga right now?

09:21.280 --> 09:23.120
Would you guys play Jenga right now?

09:23.120 --> 09:28.120
I mean, I would get on some sort of gig economy service

09:28.660 --> 09:30.080
to have somebody come to my house

09:30.080 --> 09:31.880
and set up the board for me.

09:31.880 --> 09:33.520
Because I couldn't possibly be,

09:33.520 --> 09:34.960
oh, and I just called it a board.

09:34.960 --> 09:37.040
So it's catching on.

09:37.040 --> 09:40.000
But I would love to play Jenga with you right now, Justin.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.160
I don't have the prerequisite, you know,

09:43.160 --> 09:45.400
40 minutes required to set up the Jenga game

09:45.400 --> 09:48.340
only to have your dumb unskilled hands

09:48.340 --> 09:50.240
topple the whole shit over

09:50.240 --> 09:52.080
and sending it crashing down to the floor.

09:52.080 --> 09:54.560
And you're laughing like, uh-oh, guess I did a bad job.

09:54.560 --> 09:57.120
And then I'm crying actual tears because I have to-

09:57.120 --> 09:58.300
Because you're so excited for the game.

09:58.300 --> 10:01.260
I guess in my mind, I'm kind of,

10:01.260 --> 10:03.640
I would just love to play Jenga so much right now.

10:03.640 --> 10:04.520
Yeah. Really?

10:04.520 --> 10:07.520
Well, listen, Justin, everyone loves to play Jenga,

10:07.520 --> 10:09.360
but Griffin is dead on.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.400
You know, and everyone's fine playing Jenga,

10:11.400 --> 10:14.440
but nobody wants to do the work to set up Jenga.

10:14.440 --> 10:15.280
Nobody wants to put in the hours to set it up.

10:15.280 --> 10:16.200
Yes.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.280
There was a bar here in Cincinnati

10:18.280 --> 10:20.160
since closed called Neon's.

10:20.160 --> 10:22.680
And they had like giant Jenga sets.

10:22.680 --> 10:23.920
The big Jenga, yeah.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.880
And it was like huge blocks, right?

10:25.880 --> 10:28.340
And the thing would like, it sat on a table

10:28.340 --> 10:32.520
and the board itself was often, you know, four feet high.

10:32.520 --> 10:34.880
And that's really great because it takes Jenga

10:34.880 --> 10:36.400
as not only a game of skill,

10:36.400 --> 10:40.120
but also turns it into a truly dangerous game.

10:40.120 --> 10:41.680
Dangerous for everyone in the bar,

10:41.680 --> 10:43.040
no matter how close you are to it,

10:43.040 --> 10:44.780
because you could be sitting at the other end of the bar,

10:44.780 --> 10:46.420
having a drink with your friend, just like,

10:46.420 --> 10:47.840
I'm so sorry he left you.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.200
I know that y'all were trying to make it work out.

10:50.200 --> 10:52.000
And please, if there's anything,

10:52.000 --> 10:54.060
I know this feeling, if there's anything I can do,

10:54.060 --> 10:58.440
just as the Jenga board falls over.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.080
And it does sound like two buildings

11:00.080 --> 11:01.160
collapsing into each other,

11:01.160 --> 11:04.040
like the Rampage Monster squished them together.

11:04.040 --> 11:07.500
And it sort of scares the living shit out of everyone.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.520
It's not a fun environment.

11:09.520 --> 11:11.720
Quickly, tell me the truth.

11:12.680 --> 11:16.640
At what point do you say Jenga as it's falling?

11:16.640 --> 11:18.760
As it's falling, do you say Jenga?

11:18.760 --> 11:21.080
You screamed it for everyone to dive out of the way

11:21.080 --> 11:22.620
as one might yell timber.

11:22.620 --> 11:23.460
Yeah.

11:23.460 --> 11:24.280
Jenga!

11:24.280 --> 11:25.120
And you dive.

11:25.120 --> 11:25.960
That's right.

11:25.960 --> 11:26.780
See, that's not right.

11:26.780 --> 11:29.960
Do you chant Jenga to try to psych someone out?

11:29.960 --> 11:32.500
Do you say, uh, do you say it when you're done saying it up?

11:32.500 --> 11:33.840
Like, uh, Jenga!

11:33.840 --> 11:37.120
Well, is Jenga good or is Jenga bad?

11:37.120 --> 11:37.960
Oh, no.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.920
Nobody's ever really dialed into that,

11:39.920 --> 11:42.800
where do you yell it when you're excited

11:42.800 --> 11:44.280
because the Jenga's about to happen?

11:44.280 --> 11:46.040
Or do you use it, as Justin suggests,

11:46.040 --> 11:49.400
as a sort of, you know, wizard's curse?

11:49.400 --> 11:52.120
Jenga is derived from kujenga,

11:52.120 --> 11:54.360
a Swahili word which means to build,

11:54.360 --> 11:55.640
according to the pedia.

11:55.640 --> 11:58.640
I think as it's falling does not, does not trap.

11:58.640 --> 11:59.480
That's an un-Jenga.

11:59.480 --> 12:00.640
De-Jingas.

12:00.640 --> 12:03.200
Let me try this, let me see what you think about this.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.820
The board falls, it's scattered,

12:05.820 --> 12:07.840
everyone looks at it in silence for a moment,

12:07.840 --> 12:10.500
and the person who knocked it over just whispers,

12:10.500 --> 12:11.920
Jenga.

12:11.920 --> 12:13.820
And it's just kind of admitting defeat,

12:13.820 --> 12:15.440
and it's time to build again.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.500
Yeah, I guess the cycle begins anew.

12:17.500 --> 12:20.480
I mean, I wouldn't, I would leave the situation.

12:20.480 --> 12:21.920
I used to date the situation,

12:21.920 --> 12:23.680
but he loved playing Jenga so much.

12:23.680 --> 12:24.520
Yeah.

12:24.520 --> 12:25.360
But it didn't work out.

12:25.360 --> 12:26.640
You used to date the situation?

12:26.640 --> 12:29.920
And the situation from Jirish, or he loves Jenga.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.160
And he loved me for a time, but he loved Jenga more.

12:32.160 --> 12:33.000
He loved it so much,

12:33.000 --> 12:34.440
because each of the big, big bricks

12:34.440 --> 12:37.360
look like one of his individual strong fingers.

12:37.360 --> 12:40.520
And so Justin, did you give the situation an ultimatum,

12:40.520 --> 12:43.040
and you said like, it's me or the Jenga?

12:43.040 --> 12:43.880
I thought you were gonna ask

12:43.880 --> 12:45.160
if I gave him his first Jenga set,

12:45.160 --> 12:47.720
because a lot of people say that, and it's not true.

12:47.720 --> 12:48.840
He already had one,

12:48.840 --> 12:51.560
we found it in a lake house that we rented together,

12:51.560 --> 12:54.760
and he got so into it at that point,

12:54.760 --> 12:56.680
and it's when I really started to lose him.

12:56.680 --> 12:58.120
But so you found it at the lake house,

12:58.120 --> 13:00.480
but you did show him how to play?

13:00.480 --> 13:02.200
Everybody knows how to play Jenga.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.440
It's very obvious.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.640
If you see it set up, all you can think is,

13:05.640 --> 13:06.960
I'd love to knock this down,

13:06.960 --> 13:09.280
but I'd love to make it look like it was an accident.

13:09.280 --> 13:11.560
That's your main reaction when you see the Jenga thing,

13:11.560 --> 13:12.680
is how can I knock this down

13:12.680 --> 13:14.740
and make it look like I didn't mean to?

13:14.740 --> 13:17.360
And so everybody knows the rules of Jenga in their heart.

13:17.360 --> 13:19.400
Do you ever hear from the situation now?

13:19.400 --> 13:21.620
Yeah, when was the last time you talked to a situation?

13:21.620 --> 13:22.460
You know what?

13:22.460 --> 13:25.080
I always hear from him when there's a new

13:25.080 --> 13:27.680
limited edition set released.

13:27.680 --> 13:30.660
Because he thinks that I'm gonna be excited about it too.

13:30.660 --> 13:33.040
Like, hey, did you hear there's Donkey Kong Jenga?

13:33.040 --> 13:35.840
Hey, did you hear there's Jenga blank?

13:35.840 --> 13:37.880
Or there's giant, giant Jenga.

13:37.880 --> 13:39.160
You remember Sex Jenga,

13:39.160 --> 13:41.440
where they would write like a little sexy things

13:41.440 --> 13:43.120
you're supposed to do when you pull the bricks out?

13:43.120 --> 13:47.840
Is there any less sexual situation imaginable on earth

13:47.840 --> 13:49.640
than playing Jenga?

13:49.640 --> 13:52.600
I don't like conflating that at the act

13:52.600 --> 13:57.600
of beautiful lovemaking with a lot of brick removal tension.

13:59.200 --> 14:02.120
So, oh wait, the question, of course.

14:02.120 --> 14:04.620
Yes, of course, all apologies.

14:04.620 --> 14:05.960
You should just play Jenga,

14:05.960 --> 14:07.880
because it's fun and I love to play Jenga.

14:07.880 --> 14:10.280
If I have time, I'll get over there.

14:10.280 --> 14:11.840
If you want me to play Jenga with your roommate

14:11.840 --> 14:13.420
instead of you, I'm happy to do it.

14:13.420 --> 14:14.640
Let me ask you guys this.

14:14.640 --> 14:17.260
Is there a level of bad you could be at Jenga

14:17.260 --> 14:19.880
that the roommate would no longer want to play with you?

14:19.880 --> 14:20.720
Yes.

14:20.720 --> 14:21.540
Oh.

14:21.540 --> 14:23.640
Can you hide or burn one of the Jenga bricks

14:23.640 --> 14:25.600
and they'll never be able to play with that set again.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.800
Especially if you can get the bottom ones.

14:27.800 --> 14:28.640
Well.

14:30.040 --> 14:34.540
Or every night, every night burn three Jenga bricks.

14:34.540 --> 14:37.040
Right, so that way the tower just gets shorter

14:37.040 --> 14:37.880
and shorter and shorter.

14:37.880 --> 14:38.720
Oh, that's good.

14:38.720 --> 14:41.240
That's shortening the length of the game or extending it.

14:41.240 --> 14:43.480
Or are you extending the length of the game by doing that?

14:43.480 --> 14:46.000
Okay, so every night add three Jenga bricks.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.480
Add three Jenga bricks

14:47.480 --> 14:49.040
and then they'll get tired of setting it up.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.560
Well, eventually it gets pinched

14:50.560 --> 14:51.920
between the table and the ceiling.

14:51.920 --> 14:54.640
And then the friction is such that nobody can remove

14:54.640 --> 14:55.840
any bricks and now you just have

14:55.840 --> 14:57.920
sort of a cool wood column in your home.

14:57.920 --> 14:59.760
And that's gonna raise the property values.

14:59.760 --> 15:02.400
I would give any amount of money for you to read Yahoo.

15:02.400 --> 15:03.880
Here's one from Merit Palmer.

15:03.880 --> 15:06.280
Thank you Merit, it's Yahoo Answers user question mark.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.120
We'll call him.

15:08.100 --> 15:13.100
Bev asks, what makes something food?

15:13.720 --> 15:14.560
Huh.

15:14.560 --> 15:19.560
The fact that this had to be asked by this person

15:19.920 --> 15:24.920
makes me wonder what their last say hour has been like.

15:25.360 --> 15:26.200
You know what I mean?

15:26.200 --> 15:28.800
What the hour leading up to them getting on Yahoo

15:28.800 --> 15:30.360
and typing this question in was like.

15:30.360 --> 15:33.160
Let me pose this to you two.

15:33.160 --> 15:34.820
Is paper food?

15:34.820 --> 15:36.800
I mean, maybe it would be better

15:36.800 --> 15:38.760
instead of Travis going down the list

15:38.760 --> 15:41.680
of all inanimate objects that are extant,

15:41.680 --> 15:45.080
we could come up with some baseline filmmakers.

15:45.080 --> 15:46.080
I was gonna make a point.

15:46.080 --> 15:49.680
I wasn't just speaking hypothetically.

15:49.680 --> 15:50.520
I'm talking about-

15:50.520 --> 15:51.600
Okay, yes, paper is food.

15:51.600 --> 15:56.280
You could season paper in such a way

15:56.280 --> 15:57.480
that it would be pleasant to eat.

15:57.480 --> 15:59.360
Like a fucking paprika cigarette?

15:59.360 --> 16:00.200
What are you talking about?

16:00.200 --> 16:03.120
No, you could just like, you could make it pretty good.

16:03.120 --> 16:05.000
You could season it and make it good to eat

16:05.000 --> 16:08.200
and then it's got fiber in it and probably a vitamin.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.880
Justin, you are fucking with my point on purpose

16:10.880 --> 16:12.400
because you know I was gonna say,

16:12.400 --> 16:14.160
oh, it's not food, but you can eat it.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.520
And now you've taken that away from me with your-

16:16.520 --> 16:20.200
You just raised the specter of the question.

16:20.200 --> 16:23.960
The bounds of the question are what is food?

16:23.960 --> 16:25.640
What things are food?

16:25.640 --> 16:26.980
How did food do it?

16:26.980 --> 16:28.520
Just because you don't wanna eat paper

16:28.520 --> 16:30.180
doesn't mean it's not food.

16:30.180 --> 16:32.640
But here's my point is if you got a burrito

16:32.640 --> 16:34.640
wrapped in paper and you took a bite of it

16:34.640 --> 16:37.320
with the paper still on, you would go to jail.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.280
Yes, it would not be pleasant.

16:39.280 --> 16:40.600
Not all food is pleasant.

16:40.600 --> 16:41.440
That's a good point.

16:41.440 --> 16:44.440
See, I was thinking here, if you wanna eat it,

16:44.440 --> 16:46.580
put it in your tummy, it tastes good,

16:46.580 --> 16:49.440
then that's the sort of three things you need for food.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.240
But there's a lot of things that are food,

16:51.240 --> 16:56.240
like for me, a vegetable that I don't think it tastes tasty.

16:57.080 --> 16:58.160
I don't want it in my belly.

16:58.160 --> 17:00.000
I don't think I want it in my mouth.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.860
I don't desire it, but it's still food, isn't it?

17:02.860 --> 17:04.380
So shit.

17:04.380 --> 17:06.640
Yeah, it's still food.

17:06.640 --> 17:09.400
I mean, everybody's talking about a hot dog sandwich or not,

17:09.400 --> 17:10.320
but I think we can all agree,

17:10.320 --> 17:11.840
these things are food.

17:11.840 --> 17:15.320
Maybe food is completely subjective.

17:15.320 --> 17:17.640
One man's food is another man's treasure.

17:17.640 --> 17:20.720
Yeah, I look at grass and I'm like, no, thank you.

17:20.720 --> 17:23.560
But a cow looks at grass and a cow's like, yum, yum, yum.

17:23.560 --> 17:24.960
Now that's what I call food.

17:24.960 --> 17:29.440
And then I look at the cow and I say, well, do you know?

17:29.440 --> 17:33.160
To the cow, the cow thinks I'm just me.

17:33.160 --> 17:36.000
But I see the cow and I say, that's like 10 hamburgers.

17:36.000 --> 17:41.000
Cause I'm a fucking big, big wild animal, just a big idiot.

17:41.480 --> 17:44.000
Who also can't measure how big a hamburger is

17:44.000 --> 17:45.800
compared to a cow.

17:45.800 --> 17:46.640
Yeah.

17:46.640 --> 17:47.800
All right, Travis, how many hamburgers

17:47.800 --> 17:48.760
can you get out of a cow?

17:48.760 --> 17:50.280
Answer me truthfully at all times with your heart.

17:50.280 --> 17:52.160
They're not sliders.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.780
35.

17:53.780 --> 17:54.620
That's right.

17:54.620 --> 17:55.440
35 hamburgers for a single cow.

17:55.440 --> 17:56.280
No, he's right.

17:56.280 --> 17:57.120
He got it right.

17:57.120 --> 17:58.320
God, he got it right.

17:58.320 --> 18:00.120
He got the right answer.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.460
It's like, what is food?

18:02.460 --> 18:03.560
What is food?

18:03.560 --> 18:05.160
Is toothpaste food?

18:05.160 --> 18:06.240
No, stop.

18:06.240 --> 18:09.400
You gotta stop asking these dumb questions for the jokes.

18:09.400 --> 18:12.320
No, listen, toothpaste isn't food.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.280
And I can back that up.

18:14.280 --> 18:18.140
Cause if you, it has chemicals in it that make you sick

18:18.140 --> 18:20.560
if you eat more than a portion of it.

18:20.560 --> 18:21.400
Sure.

18:21.400 --> 18:24.080
And a portion is a deck of cards or the palm of your hand.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.840
So if you eat more,

18:25.840 --> 18:27.880
you should be able to eat a portion,

18:27.880 --> 18:30.720
which is a deck of cards or the palm of your hand.

18:30.720 --> 18:33.880
That's about the size of a portion of any food.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.360
And you should be able to eat a portion of anything.

18:35.360 --> 18:37.120
I thought you were saying that's how much toothpaste

18:37.120 --> 18:39.040
you're putting on your brush every time.

18:39.040 --> 18:41.280
No, that's how much food you should be able to eat

18:41.280 --> 18:43.060
of something for it to qualify as food.

18:43.060 --> 18:45.320
There should be nothing where if you ate more

18:45.320 --> 18:49.200
than a deck of cards size of it, you would be sick.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.040
You'd be dead.

18:50.040 --> 18:53.080
What if you ate a deck of cards of salt?

18:53.080 --> 18:54.040
Here's what's fucking me.

18:54.040 --> 18:54.960
Salt is food.

18:54.960 --> 18:56.060
Here's what's fucking me up.

18:56.060 --> 18:56.940
Salt is food.

18:56.940 --> 18:58.320
Eat a deck of cards of salt, you're good.

18:58.320 --> 19:00.000
Here's what's fucking me up.

19:00.000 --> 19:00.880
I don't think so.

19:00.880 --> 19:02.400
I think you'd get very sick.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.080
Here's what's fucking me up though.

19:04.080 --> 19:09.080
You take the sticky stuff of dough, that ain't food.

19:10.280 --> 19:12.160
No, that's not food.

19:12.160 --> 19:17.160
You put it in the hot area, get it out, now it's food?

19:17.280 --> 19:18.500
What?

19:18.500 --> 19:23.500
You have, by cooking it and killing some of the latent

19:24.080 --> 19:29.080
bacteria in it by cooking it, you have made it qualify

19:29.080 --> 19:32.320
for food of rule number one.

19:32.320 --> 19:34.680
Sorry, rule of food number one.

19:34.680 --> 19:38.160
You could eat a deck of it and be okay.

19:38.160 --> 19:42.120
What about a novelty size deck of playing cards?

19:42.120 --> 19:43.800
No, a deck of it, a portion.

19:43.800 --> 19:44.760
This is the rule.

19:44.760 --> 19:47.240
If you eat a deck of raw dough,

19:47.240 --> 19:49.560
that you could still get salmonella, get sick.

19:49.560 --> 19:51.240
That ain't food, cousin.

19:51.240 --> 19:53.160
Hey family, that ain't food.

19:53.160 --> 19:57.000
Let me ask you this, Justin, is drink food?

19:57.000 --> 20:00.920
Stop, you're just being a pisser right now, Trav.

20:00.920 --> 20:03.760
I'm just trying to create new rules for food.

20:03.760 --> 20:07.860
I've got one for you, where if you eat a deck of it,

20:07.860 --> 20:09.920
if it makes you sick, that ain't food, nephew.

20:09.920 --> 20:13.920
Does one must derive some form of nutrition

20:13.920 --> 20:15.660
for it to be food?

20:15.660 --> 20:17.720
Nope, because cotton candy's food.

20:17.720 --> 20:18.640
Shit.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.920
Can I cook a deck of toothpaste?

20:20.920 --> 20:21.760
Ooh.

20:21.760 --> 20:26.760
No, you would just exacerbate, that's not food.

20:26.760 --> 20:27.680
We need more rules.

20:27.680 --> 20:30.260
If you eat a deck of it and you're healthy still,

20:30.260 --> 20:31.100
that's food.

20:31.100 --> 20:31.920
That's fucked up though,

20:31.920 --> 20:33.980
because I can't do that for cheese.

20:33.980 --> 20:36.280
No, there has to be rules, Justin.

20:36.280 --> 20:38.000
There can be other rules.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.360
What other rules, Justin?

20:40.740 --> 20:43.200
You're founding a new religion here, Justin.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.440
You can't stop at one rule.

20:45.440 --> 20:48.200
I came up with the one, like my rule is great.

20:48.200 --> 20:49.560
I could eat a candle.

20:49.560 --> 20:54.200
I could eat a playing card deck size of candle,

20:54.200 --> 20:55.840
and I think I would live.

20:55.840 --> 20:57.400
Probably not though.

20:57.400 --> 20:58.880
I didn't say live.

20:58.880 --> 20:59.700
Oh.

20:59.700 --> 21:00.920
I said get sick.

21:00.920 --> 21:03.960
And I think my friend, my young friend,

21:03.960 --> 21:08.240
I think that if you ate a candle the size of your fist,

21:08.240 --> 21:11.080
you'd probably not be feeling tip top

21:11.080 --> 21:12.120
for the rest of the day.

21:12.120 --> 21:13.800
That isn't food, brother.

21:13.800 --> 21:14.840
I'm looking around my room,

21:14.840 --> 21:16.240
thinking about things I could eat

21:16.240 --> 21:19.040
a playing card deck size of.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.000
I'll give you one.

21:20.960 --> 21:21.960
Some playing cards.

21:21.960 --> 21:22.800
Uh-huh.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.160
It's rule two.

21:25.160 --> 21:28.280
If someone, no, it can't just be someone,

21:28.280 --> 21:31.000
because there would be people that would eat a candle

21:31.000 --> 21:32.240
and say like, I loved it.

21:32.240 --> 21:35.040
I'm gonna say if there's 20 people anywhere on Earth

21:35.040 --> 21:37.360
who do enjoy eating the thing,

21:37.360 --> 21:39.920
it also then is food.

21:39.920 --> 21:43.160
Does that include like YouTube prank videos?

21:43.160 --> 21:44.560
Ah, shit, yeah.

21:44.560 --> 21:47.880
You don't, you would be so sick.

21:47.880 --> 21:52.080
If you ate a deck of playing cards, they're waxed.

21:52.080 --> 21:53.360
You would be sick.

21:53.360 --> 21:54.800
It's not food.

21:54.800 --> 21:57.120
I'm not gonna tell you how my fucking trick works, dude.

21:57.120 --> 21:58.320
I ate a deck of playing cards

21:58.320 --> 21:59.920
and I'm still here alive to tell the tale.

21:59.920 --> 22:01.320
You figure it out.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.800
Does anybody have another rule for food?

22:03.800 --> 22:05.600
I already fucking gave you one.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.520
My esoteric one.

22:07.520 --> 22:10.640
Would you eat this in front of the Pope?

22:10.640 --> 22:11.480
What food?

22:11.480 --> 22:13.120
Hey, let's pretend for a second.

22:13.120 --> 22:15.120
Because I would eat some ribs in front of the Pope.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.080
Oh, hell yeah.

22:16.080 --> 22:18.080
What is the number one food

22:18.080 --> 22:20.040
that you at least want to eat

22:20.040 --> 22:22.760
in front of a potential employer?

22:22.760 --> 22:24.320
My own resume.

22:24.320 --> 22:25.720
Yeah, probably a cake

22:25.720 --> 22:27.640
with pictures of their family on it.

22:27.640 --> 22:30.480
You guys are the pits.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.000
You're not even applying yourselves

22:32.000 --> 22:33.640
to the context of the question.

22:33.640 --> 22:35.600
I wouldn't want to eat their lunch.

22:35.600 --> 22:38.960
Okay, but like, you all are like,

22:38.960 --> 22:40.360
if the man had seen the sawdust,

22:40.360 --> 22:42.560
he wouldn't have died lateral thinking, puzzled me.

22:42.560 --> 22:43.400
Oh, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

22:43.400 --> 22:44.800
I just want a good answer.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.040
Yeah, I got a good answer.

22:47.040 --> 22:48.240
It could be a hot dog

22:48.240 --> 22:49.560
that you've written the word dickhead

22:49.560 --> 22:51.000
and mustard on the top of it.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.560
How about Taco Bell?

22:53.560 --> 22:55.240
A big bag of Taco Bell.

22:55.240 --> 22:57.800
And there's, instead of a receipt inside,

22:57.800 --> 23:00.080
there's a piece of paper that says I stole this.

23:00.080 --> 23:04.640
How about a big bag of Taco Bell

23:04.640 --> 23:07.200
and also you're at Qdoba?

23:07.200 --> 23:09.760
Oh, you're applying for a job at Qdoba.

23:09.760 --> 23:10.600
Yeah.

23:10.600 --> 23:13.320
Let me, I would like to suggest

23:13.320 --> 23:15.400
a pretty dynamic change

23:15.400 --> 23:18.360
to the way we are thinking about things.

23:18.360 --> 23:21.600
I would like to suggest we split this into two categories.

23:21.600 --> 23:26.080
Food, F-O-O-D, and that's where your sandwiches,

23:26.080 --> 23:28.320
you know, your salads,

23:28.320 --> 23:30.240
what you would think of when you think of food goes.

23:30.240 --> 23:34.840
And then food, F-U, with an umlaut over it, C,

23:34.840 --> 23:37.480
where we can put stuff like some paper,

23:39.040 --> 23:41.120
a leaf you found outside.

23:41.120 --> 23:45.200
You can't, okay, the word you're looking for is edible.

23:45.200 --> 23:47.680
We have two rules for food, Travis.

23:47.680 --> 23:50.120
Yes, but no rules for feud.

23:50.120 --> 23:51.640
Everything else is feud.

23:51.640 --> 23:53.880
If it's edible and not food, it's feud.

23:53.880 --> 23:55.120
Yes, this is what I'm saying.

23:55.120 --> 23:57.400
Okay, here are the two rules we have for food.

23:59.400 --> 24:02.240
If you can eat a deck of it and not get sick

24:02.240 --> 24:07.240
and 20 people anywhere like it.

24:07.240 --> 24:09.160
But it can't be the same 20 people

24:09.160 --> 24:12.920
who are just like stunting to expand the list.

24:12.920 --> 24:15.240
I think we're on it, we got a good start here.

24:15.240 --> 24:17.040
And then everything else is feud.

24:17.040 --> 24:20.280
Everything else is feud, a new food-like product

24:20.280 --> 24:21.880
from Travis McElroy.

24:21.880 --> 24:24.480
Gang, I'm thinking it might just be easier

24:24.480 --> 24:26.600
to just do a list.

24:26.600 --> 24:27.440
See?

24:27.440 --> 24:31.920
All the things that are food.

24:31.920 --> 24:34.040
Listen, I'm just saying that I think we will find

24:34.040 --> 24:36.120
less things that aren't food.

24:36.120 --> 24:40.080
So if we went, can we get the folks down at MIT on this?

24:40.080 --> 24:42.040
Recently, I moved to a small town

24:42.040 --> 24:44.880
that's about three by three miles long.

24:44.880 --> 24:47.600
Nine square miles, next question.

24:47.600 --> 24:48.640
Nice try.

24:48.640 --> 24:50.680
How big is my town?

24:50.680 --> 24:53.040
How big's my town in square mileage?

24:53.040 --> 24:55.200
There's your answer, next.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.320
Sometimes while I'm working at my retail job,

24:58.320 --> 25:01.280
I'll see customers with a nice cold Jamba Juice

25:01.280 --> 25:03.640
and think about treating myself to one.

25:03.640 --> 25:05.600
The problem is that there isn't a Jamba Juice

25:05.600 --> 25:06.960
in my town at all.

25:06.960 --> 25:07.800
Yeah.

25:07.800 --> 25:09.960
Ha ha ha ha ha.

25:09.960 --> 25:12.120
The closest neighboring town that has one

25:12.120 --> 25:14.120
is about a 40 minute drive.

25:14.120 --> 25:15.560
I spent all my time Googling

25:15.560 --> 25:19.360
and can't find one in my or my neighboring towns.

25:19.360 --> 25:21.280
Would it be okay for me to ask a customer

25:21.280 --> 25:22.800
where the Jamba Juice is?

25:22.800 --> 25:25.800
Do my customers drive 40 minutes for juice?

25:25.800 --> 25:26.720
Should I?

25:27.600 --> 25:29.440
This is from Jamba Juice Junkie.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.640
Well, let me make one quick correction.

25:31.640 --> 25:36.640
Your customers drive 80 minutes for a Jamba Juice.

25:36.920 --> 25:37.760
Sure.

25:37.760 --> 25:39.800
That's a fucking great point, Travis.

25:39.800 --> 25:41.000
Thank you so much.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.040
How is there even juice left in the cup

25:43.040 --> 25:44.160
by the time they get to you?

25:44.160 --> 25:46.480
How do you not immediately drain one of these?

25:46.480 --> 25:48.560
Maybe they take like a cooler with them.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.800
They buy eight Jamba Juices at once,

25:50.800 --> 25:53.840
put it in some dry ice, have it all week.

25:53.840 --> 25:55.740
Do you know how far I would have to drive

25:55.740 --> 25:56.920
to get the Jamba Juice?

25:56.920 --> 25:57.760
Uh oh.

25:57.760 --> 25:59.540
Ooh, how far Justin?

25:59.540 --> 26:02.500
Well, it wouldn't be 40 minutes, my man.

26:02.500 --> 26:04.280
Our town is a little bit bigger

26:04.280 --> 26:07.940
than nine by nine square miles,

26:07.940 --> 26:11.040
but your boy Hoops would need to drive

26:11.040 --> 26:14.400
three and a half hours to get the Jamba Juice.

26:14.400 --> 26:16.400
So I'd have to really be craving that.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.360
I don't know if I've ever had this juice.

26:18.360 --> 26:20.000
Is it good?

26:20.000 --> 26:21.680
I mean, it's not three and a half hours.

26:21.680 --> 26:24.160
Sorry, as Travis and Riley points out, seven hours.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.840
I mean, just so you don't feel bad, Justin,

26:25.840 --> 26:27.520
here in Cincinnati, which I would call

26:27.520 --> 26:29.460
a smallish major city.

26:29.460 --> 26:30.640
That's a juice town.

26:30.640 --> 26:31.480
That's a juice town.

26:31.480 --> 26:35.640
The closest one is in Lexington, 81 miles away.

26:35.640 --> 26:38.840
Maybe what we're really realizing here right now

26:38.840 --> 26:42.960
is that maybe Jamba Juice needs to open some more locales.

26:42.960 --> 26:45.280
Or Question Asker needs to.

26:45.280 --> 26:47.360
Oh my god, Travis.

26:47.360 --> 26:48.200
Yes.

26:48.200 --> 26:50.360
The universe has been speaking to you

26:50.360 --> 26:53.480
with these brave pilgrims and their delicious juice.

26:53.480 --> 26:55.040
The universe is telling you,

26:55.040 --> 26:58.960
Dilip, listen, it's time to open a Jamba Juice.

26:58.960 --> 27:00.820
Quit your job. The market is here.

27:00.820 --> 27:02.360
The market is here.

27:02.360 --> 27:04.800
Your town is full of people that love Jamba Juice

27:04.800 --> 27:06.040
and hate driving.

27:06.040 --> 27:07.700
The time has come.

27:07.700 --> 27:11.960
And maybe if you want to save on some fees

27:11.960 --> 27:15.800
and some negotiating with Jamba Juice,

27:15.800 --> 27:18.320
just open a Jumbo Juice.

27:18.320 --> 27:21.960
Same exact everything else, but now it's you

27:21.960 --> 27:23.200
and you don't have to pay for a franchise.

27:23.200 --> 27:24.740
Open a Jambi Juice.

27:24.740 --> 27:26.900
And you're gonna work with your friend Paul Reubens.

27:26.900 --> 27:29.040
You're gonna open a Jambi Juice.

27:29.040 --> 27:32.200
And John Paragon, I guess, would have to get in on it

27:32.200 --> 27:34.000
to do like VO and stuff.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.320
I don't think you can ask them

27:35.320 --> 27:37.360
where they got the juice, though.

27:37.360 --> 27:38.720
You don't think-

27:38.720 --> 27:40.520
Cause that conversation would go,

27:40.520 --> 27:41.600
hey, where'd you get that?

27:41.600 --> 27:44.680
And they would say, Jamba Juice.

27:44.680 --> 27:48.520
Or maybe they're getting it from like a Speak Juicy

27:48.520 --> 27:49.840
and they can't tell you where,

27:49.840 --> 27:52.200
cause it's like an underground Jamba Juice here in town

27:52.200 --> 27:53.440
that you're not allowed to know about

27:53.440 --> 27:55.360
cause you just moved there.

27:55.360 --> 27:58.120
Or maybe it's not a real Jamba Juice

27:58.120 --> 28:00.320
that they're getting their juice from.

28:00.320 --> 28:02.020
It's an old foot locker

28:02.020 --> 28:04.720
that somebody is just crushing up some oranges and apples

28:04.720 --> 28:05.560
and what have you in.

28:05.560 --> 28:07.360
And then they say, they sell it to them

28:07.360 --> 28:09.080
and they say, this will be $60.

28:09.080 --> 28:10.360
And they say, that seems stiff.

28:10.360 --> 28:13.040
And they say, well, can I tell you, we're a real Jamba Juice.

28:13.040 --> 28:14.900
And you don't wanna burst their bubble

28:14.900 --> 28:17.040
that they're drinking bootleg Jamba Juice.

28:17.040 --> 28:19.160
Haven't you noticed that it's just like solo cops

28:19.160 --> 28:21.320
with the words Jamba Juice written onto it?

28:21.320 --> 28:23.800
And it's got a lot of seeds, like many seeds.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.560
It's so seedy.

28:25.560 --> 28:27.360
It's pretty much all seeds.

28:27.360 --> 28:29.240
How far would you guys drive for juice?

28:29.240 --> 28:30.280
How far would I drive for juice?

28:30.280 --> 28:32.440
I wouldn't go to my kitchen for juice, Justin.

28:32.440 --> 28:37.440
If I handed you a cold juice right now,

28:39.000 --> 28:40.600
you would just upturn the cup, huh?

28:40.600 --> 28:42.200
Yes, onto your head.

28:42.200 --> 28:45.080
Hey folks, it's just sugar.

28:45.080 --> 28:45.920
Whoa.

28:45.920 --> 28:46.740
You're welcome, yeah.

28:46.740 --> 28:49.600
Didn't even think political would happen on this show.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.320
But Justin got political.

28:51.320 --> 28:53.680
I'm just mad because I tried to do a juice fast once

28:53.680 --> 28:55.080
on the day of trick or treat,

28:55.080 --> 28:56.720
and I only made it four hours.

28:56.720 --> 29:01.480
Did you try to juice a bit of honey?

29:01.480 --> 29:03.240
And you're like, this is not producing much.

29:03.240 --> 29:04.240
Nothing.

29:04.240 --> 29:06.160
This is nothing.

29:06.160 --> 29:07.740
Oh boy, it was bad though.

29:08.960 --> 29:11.060
Let's take a quick trip over to the money table.

29:11.060 --> 29:16.060
Hey, can I tell you about Blue Apron?

29:22.920 --> 29:24.120
Can I tell you about Blue Apron?

29:24.120 --> 29:25.660
Yeah, Justin, you do it.

29:25.660 --> 29:30.660
Every Friday, I go out on, and I open my front door,

29:31.620 --> 29:33.200
and you know what's waiting for me?

29:33.200 --> 29:34.720
Don't say a cardboard box.

29:34.720 --> 29:35.700
It's so much more than that.

29:35.700 --> 29:38.460
It's a world of cuisine.

29:38.460 --> 29:41.620
Now this is all food, not the box.

29:41.620 --> 29:43.420
Not the box, not the frozen elements.

29:43.420 --> 29:44.700
Well, the box is feud,

29:44.700 --> 29:47.220
and the frozen elements are probably feud too,

29:47.220 --> 29:48.740
but don't take my word for it.

29:48.740 --> 29:51.460
And they're really delicious food at that.

29:51.460 --> 29:56.140
Blue Apron delivers fresh, pre-proportioned ingredients

29:56.140 --> 29:58.980
with step-by-step recipes right to your door

29:58.980 --> 30:01.320
that can be cooked in under 45 minutes.

30:01.320 --> 30:02.980
I have been a Blue Apron customer

30:02.980 --> 30:06.280
since they started advertising with us,

30:06.280 --> 30:09.060
and I pay for all my Blue Apron meals now.

30:09.060 --> 30:11.460
I say that with a point of pride.

30:11.460 --> 30:13.700
I'm happy that I can continue to support

30:13.700 --> 30:15.180
this great organization

30:15.180 --> 30:17.980
because they deliver such fantastic food.

30:17.980 --> 30:22.980
Sidney made one yesterday that was like a noodle dish,

30:23.700 --> 30:26.300
like a chicken noodle dish

30:26.300 --> 30:30.660
with some semolina in there and some seasoning.

30:30.660 --> 30:32.900
Oh boy, I know I'm not describing it very well,

30:32.900 --> 30:35.020
but hachi-machi was it ever good.

30:35.020 --> 30:36.420
You're gonna love this stuff.

30:36.420 --> 30:39.140
They're chef-designed recipes,

30:39.140 --> 30:41.500
and you're gonna feel like you really know

30:41.500 --> 30:42.380
what you're doing around the kitchen,

30:42.380 --> 30:44.380
and if you do it for long enough, you really will.

30:44.380 --> 30:46.540
I've worked with so many ingredients

30:46.540 --> 30:47.820
that I wouldn't have worked with otherwise,

30:47.820 --> 30:49.220
and I feel like, honestly, I know, Griffin,

30:49.220 --> 30:50.340
you feel the same way,

30:50.340 --> 30:53.340
just I have learned a lot about cooking.

30:53.340 --> 30:54.180
Yeah, it's very.

30:54.180 --> 30:55.380
Which I would never try otherwise.

30:55.380 --> 30:56.740
It's a very good skill to know.

30:56.740 --> 30:58.120
Thank you, Blapron.

30:58.120 --> 30:59.460
So check out this week's menu

30:59.460 --> 31:02.400
and get your first three meals free

31:02.400 --> 31:07.460
at blueapron.com slash my brother.

31:07.460 --> 31:10.380
No, blueapron.com slash my brother.

31:10.380 --> 31:12.580
You fucked that up so bad.

31:12.580 --> 31:15.580
We say that at least like six times an episode.

31:15.580 --> 31:17.620
This is why we created the different one.

31:17.620 --> 31:19.760
This is my brother and my sitter.

31:19.760 --> 31:23.800
Go to blapron.com.

31:23.800 --> 31:26.620
That's our private vanity URL

31:26.620 --> 31:29.140
that we registered much to their chagrin.

31:29.140 --> 31:32.000
That'll take you to blueapron.com slash my brother,

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
or you can go to blapron.com

31:34.000 --> 31:37.220
and get your first three meals free.

31:37.220 --> 31:42.220
Blue Apron is, quite simply, if I do say so myself,

31:42.320 --> 31:43.460
a better way to cook.

31:43.460 --> 31:44.580
Can I tell you about Wink?

31:44.580 --> 31:47.100
Fuck me, I wanna do one of the ads.

31:47.100 --> 31:48.220
Here's the thing about Wink.

31:48.220 --> 31:50.620
I love wine.

31:50.620 --> 31:51.940
But for a while there,

31:51.940 --> 31:54.780
I thought I just kinda sorta liked wine.

31:54.780 --> 31:56.500
Cause basically I was just being introduced

31:56.500 --> 31:58.760
to the same like three bottles

31:58.760 --> 32:00.940
over and over and over again.

32:00.940 --> 32:03.780
But with Wink, I type in a couple of things.

32:03.780 --> 32:05.340
They ask me a couple of simple questions,

32:05.340 --> 32:07.060
like how do you take your coffee

32:07.060 --> 32:08.580
and how do you feel about blueberries?

32:08.580 --> 32:10.380
And frankly, I don't trust them.

32:10.380 --> 32:12.300
With just those simple answers,

32:12.300 --> 32:13.780
they will then recommend to you

32:13.780 --> 32:15.060
and send you some wines

32:15.060 --> 32:18.220
that are well-suited to your palate and your taste

32:18.220 --> 32:19.580
without you having to know anything

32:19.580 --> 32:21.380
about your palate and your taste.

32:21.380 --> 32:22.640
It's incredible.

32:22.640 --> 32:23.740
And these wines come

32:23.740 --> 32:26.220
and they're new and interesting brands

32:26.220 --> 32:27.640
I had never seen in a store,

32:27.640 --> 32:29.740
but I'm now falling in love with.

32:29.740 --> 32:32.780
And you can personalize, you know, what bottles you get.

32:32.780 --> 32:34.220
And there's no membership fees.

32:34.220 --> 32:35.720
You can skip any month.

32:35.720 --> 32:37.060
You can cancel any time.

32:37.060 --> 32:38.220
Shipping is covered.

32:38.220 --> 32:40.740
And if you don't like a bottle, they'll replace it.

32:40.740 --> 32:41.840
No questions asked.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.220
It's a great deal.

32:43.220 --> 32:46.240
Have you tried Jason Biggs Power Wine?

32:48.060 --> 32:51.060
No, that one hasn't come yet.

32:51.060 --> 32:52.320
You gotta, I think, request it.

32:52.320 --> 32:55.660
Well, it takes a specific sort of profile answer.

32:55.660 --> 32:57.320
And it's one that you wouldn't normally

32:57.320 --> 32:58.280
sort of fill in there.

32:58.280 --> 33:01.620
You have to really be looking for Jason Biggs Power Wine.

33:01.620 --> 33:04.380
But they ask you things like, what's your favorite movie?

33:04.380 --> 33:06.320
And you do have to say, you know,

33:06.320 --> 33:08.880
American Pie, Saving Silverman, something like that.

33:08.880 --> 33:11.760
And it's like, name one word, one adjective,

33:11.760 --> 33:13.740
how you want your wine.

33:13.740 --> 33:17.720
And you said, you have to say like psyched up.

33:17.720 --> 33:20.380
Or just big, but two Gs.

33:20.380 --> 33:23.260
Or you just put in, it says any additional details

33:23.260 --> 33:24.540
and you can just type in there,

33:24.540 --> 33:27.380
I wanna drink the Jason Biggs Power Wine.

33:27.380 --> 33:29.720
And that'll usually get it to you there.

33:29.720 --> 33:31.300
And I know you're probably wondering, is it red?

33:31.300 --> 33:32.700
Is it white?

33:32.700 --> 33:34.700
It doesn't have a discernible color.

33:34.700 --> 33:36.620
It's kind of opalescent, I guess,

33:36.620 --> 33:38.120
would be the word I would use.

33:38.120 --> 33:40.100
Yeah, chunky.

33:40.100 --> 33:41.920
So you can discover great wine today

33:41.920 --> 33:44.960
if you go to trywink.com slash my brother.

33:44.960 --> 33:49.960
That's trywink, T-R-Y-W-I-N-C.com slash my brother.

33:50.100 --> 33:52.820
And when you do, you'll get $20 off your first shipment.

33:52.820 --> 33:56.980
That's trywink.com slash my brother for $20 off.

33:56.980 --> 33:57.920
Go check it out.

33:57.920 --> 33:59.060
I wanna tell you about a podcast.

33:59.060 --> 34:01.340
This one's called I Hate It, But I Love It.

34:01.340 --> 34:02.180
That's the name of it.

34:02.180 --> 34:05.180
It is not my review of the show.

34:05.180 --> 34:06.860
It's called I Hate It, But I Love It.

34:06.860 --> 34:09.020
You can find it at hatelovepodcast.com

34:09.020 --> 34:10.500
or wherever you get your podcasts.

34:10.500 --> 34:12.980
I Hate It, But I Love It is a super fun podcast

34:12.980 --> 34:15.900
about the pop culture you love and hate simultaneously.

34:15.900 --> 34:18.780
Each week, hosts and best pals Kat and Jocelyn

34:18.780 --> 34:22.140
discuss a movie or TV show that they both love and hate,

34:22.140 --> 34:24.780
like Game of Thrones, Armageddon, The Devil Wears Prada,

34:24.780 --> 34:26.860
or anything J.J. Abrams ever made.

34:26.860 --> 34:29.220
Then they try to figure out why they feel that way.

34:29.220 --> 34:31.060
Oh, and did I mention they're Canadian?

34:31.060 --> 34:32.240
That's not really important,

34:32.240 --> 34:34.080
but any Canadians listening right now

34:34.080 --> 34:35.440
just got a little bit excited.

34:35.440 --> 34:36.720
You should listen.

34:36.720 --> 34:39.040
I think you should listen no matter where you live,

34:39.040 --> 34:41.180
but Canadians, you're gonna love

34:41.180 --> 34:44.460
all of the great Canadian sensibilities

34:44.460 --> 34:46.340
present in this show, I bet.

34:46.340 --> 34:48.020
So that's I Hate It, But I Love It.

34:48.020 --> 34:52.280
You can find it on your podcast destination.

34:52.280 --> 34:55.540
We have a message for future Annie,

34:55.540 --> 34:58.860
and it's from present Annie, and it says,

34:58.860 --> 35:02.460
Annie, I hope you aren't driving to work right now

35:02.460 --> 35:03.540
while you hear this.

35:03.540 --> 35:05.060
It's okay if you are.

35:05.060 --> 35:06.660
I'm not disappointed in you.

35:06.660 --> 35:08.800
All things take time.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.940
You're probably absolutely crushing it

35:10.940 --> 35:12.420
no matter what you're doing.

35:12.420 --> 35:14.780
I hope things are better then than now.

35:14.780 --> 35:15.620
Don't settle.

35:15.620 --> 35:16.500
You can always do better.

35:16.500 --> 35:19.760
Also, Madison, I hope you're good.

35:20.620 --> 35:21.860
This was for me, though.

35:21.860 --> 35:24.860
They wanted this to air in March,

35:24.860 --> 35:29.580
so I super duper hope that things are going well for you

35:29.580 --> 35:31.180
because it's been a few months.

35:31.180 --> 35:33.620
Yet a few bonus months there tacked on to the end

35:33.620 --> 35:36.140
where things have almost certainly started doing better.

35:36.140 --> 35:39.540
I have to imagine they've gotten better at this point.

35:39.540 --> 35:41.340
I mean, the span, I mean, the events

35:41.340 --> 35:43.340
of everything that's happened between March and June

35:43.340 --> 35:47.220
is nothing but just no clouds in the sky,

35:47.220 --> 35:49.140
beautiful, bright, sunshiny day.

35:49.140 --> 35:50.780
Yep, yep, yep.

35:50.780 --> 35:53.020
Annie, I think you're great,

35:53.020 --> 35:56.580
and I bet you are crushing it no matter what you're doing.

35:56.580 --> 35:57.420
And Madison-

35:57.420 --> 35:58.540
We're proud of you.

35:58.540 --> 36:01.660
And Madison, quit trying to jump in on Annie's thing.

36:01.660 --> 36:04.420
Yeah, yeah, Madison, back off.

36:04.420 --> 36:05.680
This is for Annie.

36:05.680 --> 36:08.860
I actually don't, I actually wonder about Annie's situation

36:08.860 --> 36:11.660
because since Annie, I hope you aren't driving to work

36:11.660 --> 36:13.380
right now while you hear this.

36:13.380 --> 36:15.000
It's okay if you are.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.520
Are they disappointed?

36:16.520 --> 36:18.140
There's a few things that can be disappointing to you.

36:18.140 --> 36:20.980
One, that they're listening to the show still.

36:20.980 --> 36:22.740
They have maybe wanted to stop.

36:22.740 --> 36:24.180
I hope that's not the case.

36:24.180 --> 36:25.640
Or disappointed that they heard it.

36:25.640 --> 36:28.060
It could be they wanted to stop driving to work,

36:28.060 --> 36:30.180
and they promised themselves they would start walking

36:30.180 --> 36:31.600
or riding their bike.

36:31.600 --> 36:33.180
That may be another thing.

36:33.180 --> 36:36.660
Or it could be that they wanted them to have a different job.

36:36.660 --> 36:39.040
I think Matt, I thought I took it as,

36:39.900 --> 36:43.160
I'm disappointed in you for listening to anything

36:43.160 --> 36:44.140
while driving to work,

36:44.140 --> 36:46.380
a time when you should be focusing on driving.

36:46.380 --> 36:48.700
Yeah, you should be driving, pay attention to driving.

36:48.700 --> 36:51.620
This is for Pat, and it's from Sam.

36:51.620 --> 36:52.740
Hi, Pat.

36:52.740 --> 36:54.780
I know we said we weren't gonna do this,

36:54.780 --> 36:58.400
but you're proposing to Rebecca today,

36:58.400 --> 37:00.460
so that seems like a big deal.

37:00.460 --> 37:05.220
So since this is going to be in the future, happy wedding.

37:05.220 --> 37:07.420
Congrats on that coming up.

37:07.420 --> 37:11.020
Unless she says no, which would be a colossal bummer.

37:11.020 --> 37:13.160
Not that I need to tell you that.

37:13.160 --> 37:15.820
In that case, keep your chin up, bud.

37:15.820 --> 37:16.740
I love you.

37:16.740 --> 37:20.060
And that's for whenever, man.

37:20.060 --> 37:24.100
Okay, a lot going on.

37:24.100 --> 37:25.120
Yeah.

37:25.120 --> 37:26.660
A lot going on.

37:26.660 --> 37:30.260
I feel like I need some sort of Reddit fan club

37:30.260 --> 37:33.420
to break down the timeline for this.

37:33.420 --> 37:37.780
I need an Inception flow chart to sort of follow.

37:38.780 --> 37:40.860
What I love about this Jumbotron

37:40.860 --> 37:42.820
is what this makes me think

37:42.820 --> 37:45.580
is that Sam was talking to Pat,

37:45.580 --> 37:46.540
and Pat was like,

37:46.540 --> 37:49.140
yeah, I'm gonna propose to Rebecca today.

37:49.140 --> 37:52.980
Whatever you do, don't get me a Jumbotron

37:52.980 --> 37:55.820
that wishes me a future happy wedding.

37:55.820 --> 37:58.180
And Sam says, okay, I won't do this,

37:58.180 --> 37:59.940
and then jumps onto the phone,

37:59.940 --> 38:02.780
and it's like, I know we said we weren't gonna do this.

38:02.780 --> 38:06.700
It seems like Pat has been wronged before by Sam

38:06.700 --> 38:08.380
in this exact way,

38:08.380 --> 38:09.460
because I don't know why else

38:09.460 --> 38:11.460
they would need to warn them otherwise.

38:11.460 --> 38:14.220
Well, Adam, we're still putting out

38:14.220 --> 38:16.060
the Greatest Discovery podcast

38:16.060 --> 38:17.700
while we wait for season two.

38:17.700 --> 38:19.620
What are we doing with these episodes?

38:19.620 --> 38:22.060
We've talked to a whole bunch of interesting people,

38:22.060 --> 38:24.460
like the Wall Street Journal's Ben Fritz

38:24.460 --> 38:27.580
and MaximumFun.org's own Danielle Radford.

38:27.580 --> 38:29.900
We're kind of using this time to find ways

38:29.900 --> 38:32.340
to entertain ourselves and you

38:32.340 --> 38:34.460
while we wait for the next season.

38:34.460 --> 38:36.820
So catch yourself up with Star Trek Discovery

38:36.820 --> 38:39.860
and join us Tuesday on The Greatest Discovery.

38:39.860 --> 38:43.500
It's on MaximumFun.org or wherever you get your podcasts.

38:43.500 --> 38:44.380
How about a Yahoo?

38:44.380 --> 38:46.420
Yeah, actually, no.

38:46.420 --> 38:47.620
Okay.

38:47.620 --> 38:52.620
It's time to play the game that's shaking up America.

38:52.900 --> 38:57.340
We return to it every week or so.

38:57.340 --> 38:58.340
What do you got?

38:58.340 --> 39:00.780
Celebrity Wine.

39:00.780 --> 39:03.180
Why not?

39:03.180 --> 39:04.500
Welcome to Celebrity Wine.

39:04.500 --> 39:05.340
Why not?

39:05.340 --> 39:06.180
It's a very good show.

39:06.180 --> 39:07.140
Did you know you were gonna do this

39:07.140 --> 39:10.380
before I talked about Jason Biggs' Power Wine?

39:10.380 --> 39:14.620
Celebrity Wine, Why Not is a new show.

39:14.620 --> 39:18.180
It's a quiz show with my brother, my brother, and me

39:18.180 --> 39:19.740
where I'm gonna tell you,

39:21.540 --> 39:23.940
I forget how we, how did we, what were the rules?

39:23.940 --> 39:26.580
I think you gave us the name of the wine

39:26.580 --> 39:29.300
and we tried to guess the celebrity and the rating.

39:29.300 --> 39:30.140
Okay.

39:30.140 --> 39:30.980
If I remember correctly.

39:30.980 --> 39:34.980
I am going to, okay, the list is still shared with you

39:34.980 --> 39:39.820
and I'm gonna hit you with the name and the score of a wine

39:39.820 --> 39:43.580
and you're gonna tell me which actor from our list

39:43.580 --> 39:45.060
is responsible for it.

39:45.060 --> 39:46.260
I mean, don't tell us the score though.

39:46.260 --> 39:47.260
That's half the fun.

39:47.260 --> 39:49.660
Yes, you will guess the score after.

39:49.660 --> 39:54.260
So I'm going to say our first one today,

39:54.260 --> 39:56.300
our first one, let me open up this bottle.

39:56.300 --> 40:01.300
Hello, gentlemen, I, my name is Smalley A. Justin

40:01.660 --> 40:05.140
and I am so happy you came to our restaurant.

40:06.100 --> 40:08.980
Today we have a fine bottle for you.

40:08.980 --> 40:13.980
It's a Ferguson Crest 2014 Private Reserve Syrah.

40:14.100 --> 40:16.660
It's from the Santa Ynez Valley.

40:16.660 --> 40:21.340
And it's, oh, half of the label has worn off here.

40:21.340 --> 40:25.060
I can't read the celebrity, but I knew that a very

40:25.060 --> 40:27.600
considerable celebrity was attached to this wine.

40:29.100 --> 40:30.140
Oh, I know it.

40:30.140 --> 40:31.100
Yeah, I do too.

40:31.100 --> 40:33.500
It's not the hardest one you've given us before.

40:33.500 --> 40:35.060
It did take a second.

40:35.060 --> 40:36.380
Is that by Fergie Furr?

40:36.380 --> 40:37.220
Is that Fergie's wine?

40:37.220 --> 40:39.540
Fergie Furr, that's Fergie's wine.

40:39.540 --> 40:41.580
Give me the score.

40:41.580 --> 40:42.420
Oh man.

40:42.420 --> 40:44.940
Now to remind you of the scale here,

40:44.940 --> 40:47.660
really between 80 and 100 is really the score.

40:47.660 --> 40:49.460
I'm gonna say 87.

40:49.460 --> 40:50.780
I'm gonna say 83.

40:50.780 --> 40:52.820
Well, that's a 90 on this one.

40:52.820 --> 40:54.940
Hey, great wine Fergie.

40:54.940 --> 40:56.980
Fergie did a good job.

40:56.980 --> 41:01.980
She tried her best and she was very, very, very pleased.

41:02.220 --> 41:03.940
I'm gonna Google just to real quick,

41:03.940 --> 41:07.340
see how original our nation sort of wine critics are.

41:07.340 --> 41:10.780
Fergie wine fergalicious.

41:10.780 --> 41:13.300
And see how many people sort of led with that.

41:13.300 --> 41:14.320
Yeah, yep.

41:14.320 --> 41:17.940
Len, it looks like my computer just imploded.

41:17.940 --> 41:19.980
It just sort of disappeared in my desk.

41:19.980 --> 41:22.100
It Googled it too hard and died.

41:22.100 --> 41:26.220
So gentlemen, please enjoy the Ferguson Crest 2014.

41:26.220 --> 41:29.060
Look out for candied blackberry and black currant.

41:29.060 --> 41:33.260
Meet with lilacs on the concentrated gooey nose

41:33.260 --> 41:34.580
of this bottling.

41:34.580 --> 41:36.020
Gooey nose?

41:36.020 --> 41:38.060
That's what wine enthusiasts fucking said.

41:38.060 --> 41:38.900
I kid you not.

41:38.900 --> 41:40.100
A gooey nose?

41:40.100 --> 41:43.340
Just a gooey nose on Fergie's wine.

41:43.340 --> 41:45.820
Fergie, this one's got a gooey nose.

41:45.820 --> 41:48.120
Next up, gentlemen, if you'll follow me over

41:48.120 --> 41:50.860
to Tuscana, Italy.

41:50.860 --> 41:53.220
We're going to be sampling the Il Pallaggio

41:53.220 --> 41:56.220
2012 Sister Moon Red.

41:56.220 --> 41:57.780
Say it again.

41:57.780 --> 42:02.780
This is the Il Pallaggio 2012 Sister Moon Red

42:02.960 --> 42:05.240
from Tuscana, Italy.

42:05.240 --> 42:06.900
You're gonna be looking for a polished palate

42:06.900 --> 42:11.300
showing mature red plum, tobacco, and vanilla.

42:11.300 --> 42:14.060
I'm going to say Lorraine Bracco.

42:14.060 --> 42:16.180
Um, I don't know who that is.

42:16.180 --> 42:17.820
I don't either.

42:17.820 --> 42:21.740
I mean, as bad as I want it to be, Mike Ditka.

42:21.740 --> 42:25.900
I don't think it is Mike Ditka.

42:25.900 --> 42:27.360
It sounds fancy.

42:27.360 --> 42:30.460
So I'm going to say either Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie

42:30.460 --> 42:32.020
or Sting.

42:32.020 --> 42:34.580
I'm going to say Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie.

42:34.580 --> 42:36.540
Oh, it was Sting, sir.

42:36.540 --> 42:39.180
Oh, sir, it was Sting.

42:39.180 --> 42:40.140
Ah, fuck.

42:40.140 --> 42:42.500
I'm actually, I have to be honest with you guys.

42:42.500 --> 42:44.940
I'm at a bit of an advantage here

42:44.940 --> 42:47.060
because while on vacation this summer,

42:47.060 --> 42:50.500
I did have a bottle of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's wine.

42:50.500 --> 42:51.460
Ah, shit.

42:51.460 --> 42:55.700
So here's the question for all of you here on the call.

42:55.700 --> 42:59.660
Who's better at wine, Sting or Fergie?

42:59.660 --> 43:03.220
Oh no, I'm going to say Sting is an 82.

43:03.220 --> 43:05.460
I'm going to say Sting didn't make good wine.

43:05.460 --> 43:08.180
I think Sting, 82 feels right to me, Trav.

43:09.260 --> 43:10.420
You know, it's 88.

43:10.420 --> 43:11.860
He did a great job.

43:11.860 --> 43:13.620
It wasn't as good as Fergie did.

43:13.620 --> 43:18.620
But yeah, we got one more in Celebrity Wine, why not?

43:18.860 --> 43:21.660
Really excited about this one.

43:21.660 --> 43:24.860
Gentlemen, let me summon my character back up.

43:24.860 --> 43:25.700
Thank you.

43:25.700 --> 43:26.780
Gentlemen, our last wine,

43:26.780 --> 43:29.460
because I can tell you're getting a little inebriated

43:29.460 --> 43:30.620
here at the table.

43:30.620 --> 43:33.780
Our last is a 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon,

43:33.780 --> 43:38.780
a Cab Sav in the lingos from Columbia Valley of Washington.

43:39.700 --> 43:43.060
And it is called Pursued by Bear.

43:43.060 --> 43:47.460
It's a 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon Pursued by Bear.

43:47.460 --> 43:50.060
It's a little Shakespearean pun.

43:50.060 --> 43:53.860
It provides plenty of immediate appeal,

43:53.860 --> 43:58.420
but will only benefit from some time in the cellar.

43:58.420 --> 44:00.500
If I can go down the list here.

44:00.500 --> 44:02.540
This isn't the Jeff Gordon Speedwine.

44:02.540 --> 44:05.340
It's not the Mario and D'Andretti Speedwine.

44:05.340 --> 44:06.900
I want to say Kyle McLaughlin,

44:06.900 --> 44:09.100
because Pursued by Bear seems like somebody

44:09.100 --> 44:13.500
who has a fun like understanding of Shakespeare

44:13.500 --> 44:16.940
and also the fact that I think it's in Washington state,

44:16.940 --> 44:19.460
which is where I think Twin Peaks is.

44:19.460 --> 44:21.300
Wait, is it from Washington?

44:21.300 --> 44:24.020
I'm sorry, gentlemen, the owner says I cannot-

44:24.020 --> 44:25.180
Oh, this game stinks.

44:25.180 --> 44:26.900
My descriptions.

44:26.900 --> 44:28.860
I'm gonna say Kyle McLaughlin.

44:28.860 --> 44:30.100
It is from Washington.

44:30.100 --> 44:31.100
I've checked with the owner.

44:31.100 --> 44:33.000
He said I could share that from you.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.100
It is from Columbia Valley of Washington.

44:35.100 --> 44:37.540
It's probably Kyle McLaughlin.

44:37.540 --> 44:41.340
So sirs, just so I can quantify this,

44:41.340 --> 44:45.340
you think Kyle McLaughlin decided to make a wine

44:45.340 --> 44:48.860
of Washington because he was in a TV show there

44:48.860 --> 44:50.260
25 years ago?

44:50.260 --> 44:51.100
Yes.

44:51.100 --> 44:51.940
Is that sort of-

44:51.940 --> 44:53.180
No, they did the reboot.

44:53.180 --> 44:55.340
This is, I told you it was a 2012.

44:55.340 --> 44:57.460
It was a 2012 Cab Sav.

44:57.460 --> 44:59.400
Someone from Washington said,

44:59.400 --> 45:02.860
you know who I bet is a big fan of us

45:02.860 --> 45:04.900
because he shot a TV show here

45:04.900 --> 45:06.780
and they reached out to Kyle McLaughlin.

45:06.780 --> 45:07.620
All right, I'm gonna change it.

45:07.620 --> 45:08.460
That's my logic.

45:08.460 --> 45:09.580
I'm gonna change it to-

45:09.580 --> 45:10.420
You're a coward.

45:10.420 --> 45:11.380
Sam Neal.

45:13.540 --> 45:15.300
The answer is Kyle McLaughlin.

45:15.300 --> 45:17.140
Yes! What the fuck?

45:17.140 --> 45:20.180
Yes, I stuck with my gut, Griffin.

45:20.180 --> 45:21.340
You are rewarded.

45:21.340 --> 45:23.700
You get a second pour here. That's bullshit.

45:23.700 --> 45:25.300
Here you go, sir, enjoy.

45:25.300 --> 45:27.980
I told you it had a fun, actor-y name,

45:27.980 --> 45:29.260
pursued by Bear.

45:29.260 --> 45:30.620
I know, but Justin came at me

45:30.620 --> 45:32.020
with all this negative energy

45:32.020 --> 45:33.540
and it ruined my vibe.

45:33.540 --> 45:35.740
Don't be bullied by our older brother.

45:35.740 --> 45:38.620
Who is better at making wine,

45:38.620 --> 45:42.300
Agent Dale Cooper or Fergie Ferg?

45:42.300 --> 45:44.020
Probably- I'm gonna go high

45:44.020 --> 45:45.980
because I'm betting that Kyle McLaughlin

45:45.980 --> 45:47.820
really got involved in the process

45:47.820 --> 45:49.180
and was a stickler for quality.

45:49.180 --> 45:50.860
I'm gonna say a 95.

45:50.860 --> 45:54.220
I'm gonna say that I've doubted Fergie in the past

45:54.220 --> 45:55.340
and it has not served me well.

45:55.340 --> 45:56.700
I think her wine's better.

45:56.700 --> 46:00.140
Kyle McLaughlin's pursued by Bear 2012 Cab Sav

46:00.140 --> 46:03.420
comes in at 93 points from my enthusiast.

46:03.420 --> 46:07.420
Second only to Earth's best celebrity winemaker,

46:07.420 --> 46:08.820
Boz Scaggs.

46:08.820 --> 46:10.620
We all remember Boz is the best.

46:10.620 --> 46:13.140
What's my dick-cause-fucking-wine call?

46:14.380 --> 46:16.700
Sir, if you want me to-

46:16.700 --> 46:19.380
I'm gonna get kicked out of this fucking winery.

46:19.380 --> 46:20.220
I'm Googling it.

46:20.220 --> 46:21.060
Fuck you, Samoyed.

46:21.060 --> 46:25.500
If you want my dick-cause-2011 Cabernet Sauvignon

46:25.500 --> 46:27.740
called The Icon.

46:27.740 --> 46:29.260
I'm sorry, no, he's got three.

46:29.260 --> 46:31.900
He's got a Merlot called The Player

46:31.900 --> 46:34.540
and he's got a Cab Sav called The Coach.

46:34.540 --> 46:37.100
I want a Coach wine.

46:37.100 --> 46:39.380
Order all three of those right now.

46:39.380 --> 46:40.620
Hi, Mike Ditka.

46:40.620 --> 46:43.420
It's me, your wine producer.

46:43.420 --> 46:44.940
We need a name for this wine.

46:44.940 --> 46:46.420
What are some words you know?

46:47.980 --> 46:48.820
The player?

46:51.620 --> 46:52.980
The coach?

46:52.980 --> 46:54.660
And the ball.

46:54.660 --> 46:57.540
No, we can't, we're not gonna do the ball wine.

46:57.540 --> 47:00.180
It's Mike Ditka's ball wine.

47:00.180 --> 47:01.180
Freshly sweet.

47:01.180 --> 47:02.820
It's got notes of currant,

47:02.820 --> 47:04.740
it's got notes of strawberry in it,

47:04.740 --> 47:06.500
and a little bit of pigskin, baby.

47:06.500 --> 47:07.780
Can we do DeWine?

47:07.780 --> 47:09.940
No, we can't do DeWine, sir.

47:09.940 --> 47:12.740
Congratulations to Kyle McLaughlin and Fergie

47:12.740 --> 47:14.500
for shocking the haters

47:14.500 --> 47:16.620
and producing a better wine than Sting.

47:17.900 --> 47:19.980
How about one, Yahoo?

47:19.980 --> 47:20.820
Yeah, I'd love that.

47:20.820 --> 47:22.340
This one's sent in by Allen.

47:22.340 --> 47:24.580
Allen, thank you, Allen.

47:24.580 --> 47:26.180
Sorry, I almost attributed it to you.

47:26.180 --> 47:28.100
It's Yahoo Answers User?

47:28.100 --> 47:33.100
So Mike Ditka asks, what to wear to laser tag?

47:34.860 --> 47:36.980
I'm Mike Ditka.

47:36.980 --> 47:38.020
From Family Guy.

47:38.020 --> 47:39.220
From Family Guy.

47:39.220 --> 47:42.940
It is really hot,

47:42.940 --> 47:45.620
and I haven't got any black tanks and stuff.

47:45.620 --> 47:48.260
Could I possibly wear a play suit, blue,

47:48.260 --> 47:50.140
or is that too much?

47:50.140 --> 47:50.980
What?

47:50.980 --> 47:52.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:52.700 --> 47:53.780
What's a play suit?

47:53.780 --> 47:55.100
Mm-hmm.

47:55.100 --> 47:57.740
A play suit, Travis, I'm glad you asked.

47:57.740 --> 47:58.580
I googled it.

47:58.580 --> 47:59.420
It's not anything.

47:59.420 --> 48:01.260
It's not anything that exists in the world.

48:01.260 --> 48:02.140
This is so tough,

48:02.140 --> 48:03.380
because you have to find something

48:03.380 --> 48:05.700
that is both resistant to lasers

48:05.700 --> 48:08.460
and nacho cheese afterwards.

48:08.460 --> 48:12.420
Yeah, something hydrophobic and laserphobic.

48:12.420 --> 48:14.500
What it, oh, I've got it.

48:14.500 --> 48:16.860
I'm sorry, I'm sorry to answer this one so quickly.

48:16.860 --> 48:17.940
We'll have to do another one,

48:17.940 --> 48:19.700
but I have the answer,

48:19.700 --> 48:22.580
and the answer is you're gonna wanna dress

48:22.580 --> 48:25.780
like an employee of the laser tag place.

48:25.780 --> 48:26.620
Okay.

48:26.620 --> 48:28.860
Okay, kind of a covert.

48:28.860 --> 48:30.620
Sure, and you get blasted.

48:30.620 --> 48:31.460
Peer-peer, and you're like,

48:31.460 --> 48:32.780
what the fuck are you doing?

48:32.780 --> 48:34.300
Can you see my clothes?

48:34.300 --> 48:35.580
I'm a journalist.

48:35.580 --> 48:37.660
I'm covering this laser war.

48:37.660 --> 48:40.300
Are you trying to get yourself thrown out of here?

48:40.300 --> 48:42.260
Because I have that power.

48:42.260 --> 48:44.500
Could you do like a RoboCup outfit?

48:44.500 --> 48:45.980
Did I say RoboCup?

48:45.980 --> 48:47.300
You did. RoboCup.

48:47.300 --> 48:48.140
Pfft.

48:48.140 --> 48:48.980
Pfft.

48:48.980 --> 48:49.800
Pfft.

48:49.800 --> 48:50.640
Pfft.

48:50.640 --> 48:51.480
Pfft.

48:51.480 --> 48:52.300
Pfft.

48:52.300 --> 48:53.140
Pfft.

48:53.140 --> 48:56.220
This police officer got killed by a big gang,

48:56.220 --> 48:57.460
and they're like, we can save him,

48:57.460 --> 48:59.180
make him even better than before.

48:59.180 --> 49:00.700
And he wakes up, and he's like,

49:00.700 --> 49:03.180
uh-oh, wait a minute, uh-oh.

49:04.700 --> 49:06.140
What did you do to me?

49:06.140 --> 49:08.460
You're like, well, you got a little handle there,

49:08.460 --> 49:10.420
cute little floral pattern.

49:10.420 --> 49:11.740
You got your own saucer.

49:11.740 --> 49:12.740
You got a saucer.

49:12.740 --> 49:13.860
This is your partner.

49:13.860 --> 49:14.700
Saucer.

49:14.700 --> 49:16.320
He used to be a firefighter,

49:16.320 --> 49:18.460
but we fucked him up too.

49:18.460 --> 49:21.620
So anyway, do I have any cool robot powers?

49:21.620 --> 49:25.780
You can hold different beverages inside.

49:25.780 --> 49:27.220
And is it gonna hurt when it's a hot,

49:27.220 --> 49:28.060
oh, it'll hurt.

49:28.060 --> 49:28.900
Yeah.

49:28.900 --> 49:29.720
It'll hurt.

49:29.720 --> 49:30.560
Yeah.

49:30.560 --> 49:31.400
How long will they stay hot or cold?

49:31.400 --> 49:33.100
Not long, you are not insulated.

49:33.100 --> 49:35.740
You're sort of a guy cup, so.

49:35.740 --> 49:36.700
Sorry about that.

49:36.700 --> 49:38.300
Sorry about all of it.

49:38.300 --> 49:41.620
They, listen, we tried to order RoboCup parts,

49:41.620 --> 49:43.900
but Jeff over here fucked up the order form,

49:43.900 --> 49:46.620
did a typo on it, so you're gonna get what you get.

49:46.620 --> 49:48.540
Hey, at least this, you're not dead.

49:48.540 --> 49:49.860
Yeah, I guess.

49:49.860 --> 49:50.860
I guess.

49:50.860 --> 49:51.860
I'd rather be.

49:51.860 --> 49:55.220
Well, the bad news is we don't know how to kill a cup.

49:55.220 --> 49:57.020
So what do I do now?

49:57.020 --> 49:58.620
Am I supposed to fight crime?

49:58.620 --> 50:02.220
Oh, well, if you want, I guess.

50:02.220 --> 50:04.820
I mean, you're not suited for that, if we're being honest.

50:04.820 --> 50:07.740
You're a cup, it feels like a tall order.

50:07.740 --> 50:09.820
And let me check this out.

50:09.820 --> 50:12.180
I heard Dizzy's making a live action Beauty and the Beast.

50:12.180 --> 50:15.420
Now we're gonna get you down there casting.

50:15.420 --> 50:16.700
Can you do a chip?

50:16.700 --> 50:18.700
Oh, wait, they made that like four years ago.

50:18.700 --> 50:20.060
Fuck, man, I don't know.

50:20.060 --> 50:22.020
You might have a job on Sunset Boulevard,

50:22.020 --> 50:24.020
get your picture taken with Chip the Cup

50:24.020 --> 50:25.740
from Beauty and the Beast.

50:25.740 --> 50:27.980
You know, you could make $20 a day.

50:27.980 --> 50:30.460
No, sorry, you can't charge for those.

50:30.460 --> 50:33.420
They might have a sequel in the works, you never know.

50:33.420 --> 50:34.900
Might be uniquely suited.

50:34.900 --> 50:35.940
Now get on out of here.

50:35.940 --> 50:38.220
We're gonna turn someone into Tupperware.

50:38.220 --> 50:40.300
Well, hold on, a sequel, that would be Beauty

50:40.300 --> 50:44.620
and the Handsome Dude and all of his human house servants.

50:44.620 --> 50:45.900
Everything still good?

50:45.900 --> 50:48.380
Yep, okay, roll credits.

50:48.380 --> 50:50.980
No, it's just called Gaston's Funeral.

50:50.980 --> 50:52.820
Don't nobody wanna go to that.

50:52.820 --> 50:55.140
Anyway, you're a cup now.

50:55.140 --> 50:56.660
Get on out of here.

50:56.660 --> 51:00.740
We had a conversation about this, we were talking about.

51:00.740 --> 51:04.900
Okay, so we are doing some shows in Orlando,

51:04.900 --> 51:08.340
and one show, no?

51:08.340 --> 51:12.220
Yeah, one show in Orlando at the end of August.

51:12.220 --> 51:15.380
So we're thinking about like ducking our heads in to Disney

51:15.380 --> 51:17.700
for a few days while we're down there.

51:17.700 --> 51:21.660
And the one thing that Charlie was really firm on

51:21.660 --> 51:24.180
is that she does not wanna see Gaston.

51:24.180 --> 51:29.180
She wants to, she does not wanna see Gaston.

51:29.500 --> 51:32.540
And she said, and we, Sydney and I were talking,

51:32.540 --> 51:35.020
and I guess in the same room as her,

51:35.020 --> 51:37.260
and Sydney very briefly said like,

51:37.260 --> 51:40.460
well, sweetie, you realize that's not the same,

51:40.460 --> 51:42.220
and then she stopped herself.

51:42.220 --> 51:45.100
We can't really go down that road.

51:45.100 --> 51:47.580
We can't go down the you know what's not the same

51:47.580 --> 51:51.260
Gaston road because you take that one brick out

51:51.260 --> 51:53.220
and it all sort of tumbles around you.

51:53.220 --> 51:55.900
And then I very helpfully jumped in and said,

51:55.900 --> 51:58.940
well, Gaston died, so that's a different Gaston.

51:58.940 --> 52:01.500
That was not better.

52:01.500 --> 52:03.020
So helpful, Justin.

52:03.020 --> 52:05.340
That was not better, actually.

52:05.340 --> 52:08.500
So it's a cyborg Gaston, nothing to be afraid of there,

52:08.500 --> 52:10.900
or brought back to life with dark magics.

52:10.900 --> 52:13.140
Again, not- An unstoppable Gaston zombie.

52:13.140 --> 52:15.220
Not anything to be afraid of there.

52:15.220 --> 52:18.340
Why do they have that pervert Gaston even at the park?

52:18.340 --> 52:20.280
I hate that guy.

52:20.280 --> 52:24.100
Why does he get, he's a very bad per,

52:24.100 --> 52:27.100
and you know what, he's not bad in the traditional,

52:27.100 --> 52:29.460
I'll steal your voice and then become the,

52:29.460 --> 52:34.460
no, he is a racist, and he gets killed for it.

52:35.360 --> 52:37.620
Whatever, but it's wild that he's like,

52:37.620 --> 52:40.660
everyone pose with me, expectorating.

52:40.660 --> 52:42.900
I'm a cool guy who tried to force a woman

52:42.900 --> 52:45.980
to marry me against her will by imprisoning her dad.

52:45.980 --> 52:48.140
Yeah, I gaslighted her dad, it was great.

52:48.140 --> 52:51.980
I ate all of Griffin's eggs and spit on his car,

52:51.980 --> 52:53.900
and it's like, Jesus, dude.

52:53.900 --> 52:57.580
You know, here's the thing though, listen,

52:57.580 --> 52:59.700
I don't want to blow this whole thing wide open,

52:59.700 --> 53:00.900
but if you think about it,

53:00.900 --> 53:04.100
the beast also imprisoned Belle's dad

53:04.100 --> 53:06.700
in an attempt to try to force her to marry him.

53:06.700 --> 53:09.620
So it seems like both of them kind of suck.

53:09.620 --> 53:11.340
I mean, there should be maybe a bad Disney World

53:11.340 --> 53:14.020
where Gaston, the beast, the bad guy from Pocahontas,

53:14.020 --> 53:16.740
who was like real bad.

53:16.740 --> 53:19.060
Real, real, real bad, pretty bad.

53:19.060 --> 53:22.340
Not fun bad, like a lot of the, you know, Ursula.

53:22.340 --> 53:24.140
This is a different podcast.

53:24.140 --> 53:25.380
This is not our podcast.

53:25.380 --> 53:27.540
I mean, I just, it's a different park.

53:27.540 --> 53:30.740
It's Nasty Disney World where bad kids go.

53:30.740 --> 53:32.980
Nasty Disney World where all the villains are kept

53:32.980 --> 53:35.460
and the bad kids can elect to go to it.

53:35.460 --> 53:39.620
They are, they haven't been redeemed.

53:39.620 --> 53:42.740
You know what, it's sort of a heaven and hell situation.

53:42.740 --> 53:43.820
Are there still rides?

53:43.820 --> 53:45.620
Yes, the rides are way cooler.

53:45.620 --> 53:47.020
The rides are so much cooler,

53:47.020 --> 53:49.660
so much more dangerous and action packed.

53:49.660 --> 53:53.100
The food's all nachos, more or less just all,

53:53.100 --> 53:56.460
just big spicy beef nachos, pretty much all over.

53:56.460 --> 53:59.340
And you can just shit anywhere.

53:59.340 --> 54:00.660
It's Nasty Disney World.

54:00.660 --> 54:01.580
It's where all they,

54:01.580 --> 54:04.420
it's where good Disney World keeps all the mosquitoes.

54:04.420 --> 54:06.060
Listen, it's not pluses and minuses.

54:06.060 --> 54:07.380
The rides are cooler.

54:07.380 --> 54:09.580
There are mosquitoes everywhere.

54:09.580 --> 54:10.420
It's fine.

54:10.420 --> 54:13.020
Their mouse buddy Sid from Toy Story, it's cool.

54:13.020 --> 54:13.860
It's really cool.

54:13.860 --> 54:16.060
You get a paintball gun when you go in.

54:16.060 --> 54:16.980
And that's nice too,

54:16.980 --> 54:20.460
because then if you're an employee at regular Disney World

54:20.460 --> 54:21.300
and they're like,

54:21.300 --> 54:23.520
Todd, I noticed that you were taking 40 minute breaks

54:23.520 --> 54:25.340
instead of 30 minute breaks.

54:25.340 --> 54:27.980
You don't want to have to work Nasty Disney, do you?

54:27.980 --> 54:29.340
Yeah. No, of course not.

54:29.340 --> 54:30.580
But then it's okay,

54:30.580 --> 54:33.440
cause Jafar will sell you some skunk weed.

54:33.440 --> 54:38.440
It's not all bad.

54:39.300 --> 54:40.380
Folks, that's gonna do it for us.

54:40.380 --> 54:44.980
Thank you so much for listening to our program.

54:44.980 --> 54:48.980
If you came out to see us in San Francisco or Phoenix,

54:49.880 --> 54:52.740
thank you for coming out.

54:52.740 --> 54:55.300
Tragic news, or I guess, I don't know,

54:55.300 --> 54:56.220
depends on your perspective.

54:56.220 --> 54:57.540
Yeah, maybe you don't care.

54:57.540 --> 55:00.060
If at the Phoenix show,

55:00.060 --> 55:02.700
that audio was...

55:02.700 --> 55:04.660
Just fucking mulch.

55:04.660 --> 55:06.580
Just fucking mulch.

55:06.580 --> 55:09.260
So that show will never be released.

55:09.260 --> 55:13.020
That is your show to treasure and enjoy.

55:13.020 --> 55:15.020
If you made a secret pirate copy of it,

55:15.020 --> 55:16.500
please let us know,

55:16.500 --> 55:18.740
cause otherwise it's lost to the ether.

55:19.820 --> 55:23.500
So don't, sorry about that.

55:23.500 --> 55:24.860
But you know, it's a special show

55:24.860 --> 55:26.140
that you get to treasure in your heart now,

55:26.140 --> 55:27.900
and no one else will ever hear.

55:27.900 --> 55:29.220
But thank you for coming out.

55:29.220 --> 55:30.060
Like I mentioned,

55:30.060 --> 55:31.460
we do have some other appearances coming up.

55:31.460 --> 55:32.500

55:34.780 --> 55:38.380

55:38.380 --> 55:40.660
And we hope that you'll join us.

55:40.660 --> 55:42.220
That includes not only our live shows,

55:42.220 --> 55:46.980
but also Summit Adventure Zone graphic novel book events.

55:46.980 --> 55:51.540
We're doing like live read and graphic novel stuff in July.

55:51.540 --> 55:55.420
And then throughout July and August,

55:55.420 --> 55:57.780
some combination of us and our dad

55:57.780 --> 55:59.140
and the artist, Carrie Peach,

55:59.140 --> 56:00.620
are going to be stopping

56:00.620 --> 56:03.060
at our kind of local bookstore establishments

56:03.060 --> 56:04.420
for meet and greets and signings.

56:04.420 --> 56:05.700
So if you don't want to miss that,

56:05.700 --> 56:09.460
McElroyShows.com slash tours, yeah.

56:09.460 --> 56:11.380
I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters

56:11.380 --> 56:12.300
for these for our theme song,

56:12.300 --> 56:15.140
It's a Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

56:15.140 --> 56:17.100
It is a, it's a choice cut.

56:17.100 --> 56:18.340
As we say in the music industry,

56:18.340 --> 56:20.260
you're gonna just love these tunes.

56:20.260 --> 56:22.420
And hey, thanks to MaxFun for having us on the network.

56:22.420 --> 56:24.180
Go to MaximumFun.org and check out

56:24.180 --> 56:25.620
all the great shows there.

56:25.620 --> 56:27.340
You're gonna find something that you're gonna enjoy.

56:27.340 --> 56:28.620
Maybe it's Bubble,

56:28.620 --> 56:31.660
the new sci-fi sort of fiction podcast

56:31.660 --> 56:33.660
that Jordan Morris wrote

56:33.660 --> 56:36.220
and a bunch of folks starred in.

56:36.220 --> 56:37.780
We have guest spots in an episode

56:37.780 --> 56:39.260
that I don't think has come out yet,

56:39.260 --> 56:43.580
but it's a very fun show that I bet you're just gonna dig

56:43.580 --> 56:44.900
because everybody worked really hard on it.

56:44.900 --> 56:48.300
It's called Bubble and all that's at MaximumFun.org.

56:48.300 --> 56:50.820
I've done a couple quick guest spots.

56:50.820 --> 56:52.180
Well, I've done a couple of guest spots

56:52.180 --> 56:57.020
on a D&D live stream show called Dice Camera Action.

56:57.020 --> 56:58.340
It's from Wizards.

56:58.340 --> 57:01.860
You can find it twitch.tv slash D&D,

57:01.860 --> 57:03.820
or it's on the D&D YouTube channel.

57:03.820 --> 57:05.460
You can just search for Dice Camera Action.

57:05.460 --> 57:07.140
And it's just been a real blast.

57:07.140 --> 57:09.420
I brought Magnus back to play with them

57:09.420 --> 57:11.280
and it's been fun playing Magnus again

57:11.280 --> 57:12.760
and playing with these folks.

57:12.760 --> 57:14.740
And Chris Perkins is the DM

57:14.740 --> 57:17.020
and he's one of our inspirations.

57:17.020 --> 57:18.500
So I'm a big fan of it

57:18.500 --> 57:20.620
and I recommend everybody check it out.

57:20.620 --> 57:22.380
Yeah, how about that final?

57:22.380 --> 57:23.220
Hit me.

57:23.220 --> 57:24.260
This one was sent in by Allen.

57:24.260 --> 57:27.960
Also, it's Yahoo Answers user, Jack M who asks,

57:29.100 --> 57:31.380
I accidentally shifted the upper case.

57:31.380 --> 57:33.100
How do I get back to lower cases

57:33.100 --> 57:34.980
so my passwords will work?

57:34.980 --> 57:38.820
My name is Justin McElroy.

57:38.820 --> 57:40.220
I'm Travis McElroy.

57:40.220 --> 57:42.060
I'm Griffin McElroy.

57:42.060 --> 57:43.180
This has been my brother, my brother,

57:43.180 --> 57:45.020
may kiss your dad's around the lips.

57:45.020 --> 58:12.540
I'm Travis McElroy and I'm Travis McElroy.

58:12.540 --> 58:15.900
Whether you are a parent or just know kids exist

58:15.900 --> 58:17.580
in the world, join us each week

58:17.580 --> 58:21.160
as we honestly share what it's like to be a parent.

58:21.160 --> 58:23.220
Turns out it isn't what we thought it would be.

58:23.220 --> 58:25.580
For example, stickers on car windows.

58:25.580 --> 58:27.800
It's no longer about what type of monster

58:27.800 --> 58:28.840
would let that happen

58:28.840 --> 58:31.880
and more like realizing you are that monster.

58:31.880 --> 58:35.060
So join us each week as we judge less, laugh more,

58:35.060 --> 58:38.260
and remind you that you are doing a great job.

58:38.260 --> 58:41.220
