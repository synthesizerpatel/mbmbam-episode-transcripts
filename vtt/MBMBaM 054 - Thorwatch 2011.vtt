00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.800
Welcome, my brother, my brother and me, where Travis has suggested we lead off the show by

00:48.800 --> 00:54.480
mentioning the release of Thor. That's his high-energy opening. Did you guys see Thor?

00:54.480 --> 00:57.600
Hey, did you guys hear about Thor? He's got this hammer thing.

00:57.600 --> 01:03.040
He's got a hammer? Did you guys see Thor? Yeah, he's like the prince of Asgard or something.

01:03.040 --> 01:08.480
Thorwatch. What's your cinch? Thorwatch 2011, Griffin.

01:08.480 --> 01:12.480
The countdown is over. The countdown is over.

01:12.480 --> 01:18.800
I saw Thor. There's a Thor signing up my Trader Joe's. He's picking up some soft pretzel bread

01:18.800 --> 01:24.160
for Loki. Thorwatch 2011 is an

01:24.160 --> 01:28.480
advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:29.680 --> 01:32.720
I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:32.720 --> 01:36.720
This is not a gag. I said, what should we lead the show off with? And Travis says,

01:36.720 --> 01:39.200
Thor came out. All right.

01:41.120 --> 01:44.400
What else happened this week that's worth noting? Thor.

01:44.400 --> 01:53.920
Yep. So as I mentioned, this is an advice show for the modern era and a Thorwatch

01:54.880 --> 01:59.760
simultaneously. We take your questions and turn them into wisdom.

01:59.760 --> 02:07.920
And first comes to us from the Carolinas. A few weeks ago, I asked out a female friend,

02:07.920 --> 02:12.080
classmate of mine. She said she thought it would be best to just be friends,

02:12.080 --> 02:19.120
but we stayed pretty close. We've had a couple of double dates as she called them with a couple

02:19.120 --> 02:26.160
we know. I started actively pursuing a relationship with her after she gave me the just friends line,

02:26.160 --> 02:33.840
but we still kept up the flirty playful banter. We text each other very often. She sends me messages

02:33.840 --> 02:39.360
like, I love you. After I say something particularly considerate or funny. For what

02:39.360 --> 02:43.840
it's worth. She's going to prom with a friend of mine who likes her, but she doesn't feel the same

02:43.840 --> 02:48.160
way about him. Obviously I'm still attracted to her, but I don't really want to try anything just

02:48.160 --> 02:53.520
to get shut down or ruin our friendship flirting. What's her deal? And how should I respond?

02:53.520 --> 02:59.280
Confused in Carolina. You should respond by getting as far away from her as possible.

02:59.840 --> 03:05.520
Yeah. You should just, we should subtitle this question. Everything bad that one person can do

03:05.520 --> 03:11.440
to another person in a relationship. All the evils of the world condensed into one question.

03:12.640 --> 03:22.000
With our, let's see, how old are we altogether? We're over 70, right? We're almost 80. With our

03:22.000 --> 03:28.800
almost 80 years of experience, we just would like to tell you that you're about to get your heart

03:28.800 --> 03:34.720
broken in a way that you cannot even wrap your mind around if you don't take some immediate action.

03:34.720 --> 03:39.760
Imagine there's like a giant hammer being swung by Thor at your face.

03:39.760 --> 03:43.600
Yeah. That's what's going on right now. You're on top of Mount Olympus.

03:45.520 --> 03:51.760
Nope. You're in Asgard and you're about to get a hammer spat in the face swung by this girl.

03:51.760 --> 03:55.840
Here's the problem here. You need to guard your ass because you're about to get fucked in it.

03:55.840 --> 04:04.000
That's what we're saying. So your issue is that this girl really, really likes the attention.

04:04.960 --> 04:10.000
That's the problem here. You need to get away from her because she's using you.

04:11.040 --> 04:18.000
Like a toothpaste tube. I guarantee that if a dude rolled up that she dug on,

04:18.000 --> 04:23.680
she would drop you so fast, you would have to pick your face up off the ground.

04:23.680 --> 04:28.640
Yeah. Hey, pick up your face. This might be painful to hear,

04:29.840 --> 04:35.600
but just imagine if it was like in gym and she was doing it in front of the bleachers and

04:35.600 --> 04:38.960
everybody. Like, trust us, it's better now in the privacy of your iPod.

04:39.680 --> 04:45.280
It sounds like she's playing a trick on you, much like Loki plays tricks on Thor,

04:45.280 --> 04:48.400
because he's the trickster. That's good, Griffin.

04:48.400 --> 04:51.360
I've never read it. I don't know what that- You're getting in the Thor-watched

04:51.360 --> 04:58.320
I don't know anything about the Thor-averse. But you do know a lot about Thor-a-birch.

04:58.880 --> 05:05.280
Yes. I would also suggest that you take a step back and look at what she's doing to your friend

05:05.280 --> 05:09.520
that she's going to prom with and realize she's doing the exact same thing to you.

05:10.640 --> 05:14.960
What's up? She's like a thermos the way she's playing the hot and cold.

05:16.480 --> 05:20.800
You know that scene in Wayne's World where Garth finds the note from the agent that says,

05:20.800 --> 05:25.840
exploit feeble public access show. And he says, I'm really glad I'm not that those guys.

05:25.840 --> 05:30.320
That's you right now. Like you are, that is the exact guy that you are right now.

05:30.320 --> 05:36.720
You're that guy. Get out, cut off all connections. And, and you know what?

05:36.720 --> 05:42.240
Here's the, here's the really crazy thing. You ready for this? She'll come after you.

05:43.760 --> 05:49.120
This is not a gag. If you have the, the wherewithal, the fortitude to just say,

05:49.120 --> 05:54.880
I'm out and run, she is going to be so into you in a heavy, heavy way.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.480
And that way lies madness.

05:56.480 --> 06:00.400
Yeah. It's, it's, it's important that you have a lot of willpower,

06:00.400 --> 06:02.560
just like Thor's best friend, the Green Lantern.

06:02.560 --> 06:19.920
Okay. So in closing, Thor is being shown in 3d and 2d in a theater near you.

06:19.920 --> 06:23.840
Get his friend out and really turn in a really nice film here.

06:23.840 --> 06:26.800
And I think they're going to enjoy the picture. Next question.

06:26.800 --> 06:33.760
How do you turn down a birthday invite when you know the party will be lame?

06:34.800 --> 06:37.520
It's not for a few weeks. So an excuse would seem weird.

06:38.160 --> 06:39.120
Action now on Twitter.

06:40.400 --> 06:45.840
Is he asking how to like how to snipe future plans? Like how to get them from far away?

06:47.040 --> 06:52.000
That's a toughie. That's a toughie. You had to have the trick is with this one.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.280
You have, you have to snipe them from the outset.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.680
Like if you're going to do a long-term snipe, it's got to be an immediate one

07:01.680 --> 07:06.880
because now you've lost the believability of, of doing a long-term snipe

07:07.520 --> 07:10.800
because they've already asked you and you should have had the conflict then.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.480
And, and first and foremost,

07:12.480 --> 07:18.640
start training yourself now to never respond in the absolute positive or absolute negative.

07:18.640 --> 07:19.680
For anything?

07:19.680 --> 07:22.800
Yeah. Well, when you get asked to make plans that you don't want to do,

07:22.800 --> 07:26.640
don't say yes. Don't say no. Say, when is that?

07:26.640 --> 07:29.440
Oh, I'm going to have to check. I think that I can't remember.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.520
For every single thing, Travis?

07:31.520 --> 07:36.240
I mean, it's a good habit to get into if you want to, if you want to be a douche nozzle.

07:36.240 --> 07:40.240
People, I've developed that habit. And let me tell you, people just love it.

07:41.120 --> 07:44.800
I have that. I have that particular quirk where everything is like,

07:44.800 --> 07:46.880
cause I hate to make plans. I hate to have plans.

07:46.880 --> 07:50.320
I'll say, yeah, well, we will definitely try to get there.

07:50.320 --> 07:54.720
Trying to, trying to hold on to Travis is like trying to hold a handful of water.

07:54.720 --> 07:57.600
You can't do it. It'll go right through the cracks of your fingers.

07:57.600 --> 07:59.360
Well, the other option is someone says,

07:59.360 --> 08:01.440
do you want to come to my birthday party in three weeks?

08:01.440 --> 08:04.000
And you say, yeah. And now-

08:04.000 --> 08:06.800
And then you go to their birthday party and you have a fucking rager.

08:06.800 --> 08:10.800
Then we're ignoring the context of the question where he's asking,

08:10.800 --> 08:13.440
how do you say no to that without seeming like a dick?

08:13.440 --> 08:17.680
Yeah. I think it's a social contract where if you say,

08:17.680 --> 08:20.240
oh, I don't know, I'm going to have to check my schedule.

08:20.240 --> 08:22.320
That is the nice way of saying no.

08:22.320 --> 08:26.640
I'm going to assume that whenever you get a Facebook invite to an event, you say maybe.

08:27.280 --> 08:27.920
I do.

08:27.920 --> 08:32.320
That's like a construct that somebody built in for your, for your non-committal.

08:32.320 --> 08:35.040
The maybe is there so that you don't have to say no.

08:35.760 --> 08:38.160
And they know that you're not going to be there.

08:38.160 --> 08:41.680
Like, cause if you say maybe no one's going, that maybe probably means yes.

08:41.680 --> 08:46.400
I'm pretty sure Emily Walpost would have some choice words for you right now, Travis.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.720
I'm pretty sure you're violating etiquette.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.640
But okay, in the exact-

08:50.640 --> 08:53.680
We're talking about how he should have, would have, should have, could have.

08:53.680 --> 08:56.320
What does he do right now, right this second?

08:57.040 --> 08:58.480
Get it off his plate.

08:58.480 --> 09:03.040
I would like to suggest A, just go put on a cat in the hat hat,

09:03.040 --> 09:05.040
roll some E, just go have a rager.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.880
Just roll some E, put on one of those big cat in the hat.

09:08.880 --> 09:11.040
How do you turn down a birthday rave?

09:11.040 --> 09:12.720
One of those big cat in the hat hats.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.960
Put on a Jester hat, you're saying.

09:14.960 --> 09:17.360
Right on yourself and some glow in the dark highlighters.

09:17.920 --> 09:18.480
Exactly.

09:18.480 --> 09:20.400
I don't know the protocol now.

09:20.400 --> 09:24.560
Oh, and then it's a self-solving problem because then you'll never get asked to

09:24.560 --> 09:26.080
another birthday party again.

09:26.080 --> 09:26.560
Yeah.

09:26.560 --> 09:30.720
If you show up to your friend's lame ass birthday party and you're fucking colon rolling, like-

09:31.760 --> 09:33.840
Like a one man, one man rave.

09:34.880 --> 09:37.360
You'll have to suffer through this one, but it'll never happen again.

09:38.320 --> 09:38.960
You gotta go.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.040
Okay, why?

09:41.040 --> 09:46.640
Well, because I think birthday parties are the one party like that people throw where

09:46.640 --> 09:50.000
it is a direct affront to your relationship if you don't go.

09:50.560 --> 09:53.680
If they're like, I'm throwing a Halloween party and you don't go, then it's like,

09:53.680 --> 09:54.320
who cares?

09:54.320 --> 09:57.200
But birthday party, it's celebrating them being alive.

09:58.800 --> 10:01.520
If you don't go, you're basically saying, I wish you were never born.

10:01.520 --> 10:03.040
Yeah, yes, exactly.

10:03.040 --> 10:04.480
This isn't worth observing.

10:04.480 --> 10:07.280
And try to think about like, when you have a birthday party,

10:07.280 --> 10:11.840
the people's birthday parties that you go to, they're gonna feel obliged to go to yours.

10:11.840 --> 10:12.160
Oh yeah.

10:12.160 --> 10:14.240
So you don't wanna be that lonely little boy.

10:14.240 --> 10:15.200
Do you, Alan?

10:15.200 --> 10:15.760
Do you?

10:15.760 --> 10:17.040
Do you, Alan?

10:18.080 --> 10:20.560
Do you, Alan?

10:20.560 --> 10:21.060
Griffin.

10:21.680 --> 10:22.640
It'll probably be sick.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.320
Yeah, it's probably gonna be sick.

10:24.320 --> 10:24.820
Griffin.

10:26.000 --> 10:26.800
You wanna Yahoo?

10:28.560 --> 10:28.800
Yes.

10:30.720 --> 10:31.680
Yes, I do.

10:31.680 --> 10:32.240
Let's see.

10:33.120 --> 10:33.600
Had a lot of new-

10:33.600 --> 10:35.760
Well, thank you for still asking after all these years.

10:35.760 --> 10:40.080
Had a lot of new contributors this year.

10:40.080 --> 10:40.800
I like that.

10:42.880 --> 10:43.440
How about this?

10:43.440 --> 10:45.200
This one was sent in by Krista Whalen.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.320
Thank you, Krista.

10:46.320 --> 10:50.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Raven Anna Lolita.

10:50.880 --> 10:56.240
Who asked, how can I lose weight off of my hands?

10:59.120 --> 11:03.040
I need to get to the peanut butter at the bottom of the jar that the knife won't get,

11:03.040 --> 11:05.600
but my hands are getting too big.

11:05.600 --> 11:08.960
So I need to make them small and I can't cut my fingers off

11:08.960 --> 11:10.800
because I need them to scoop up the peanut butter.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.640
Is this that question asked by a bear?

11:19.120 --> 11:21.840
I just wanna get one more smackerel of honey.

11:21.840 --> 11:23.680
Listen, here's the thing.

11:24.240 --> 11:26.160
Help, head stuck in the honey jar.

11:27.440 --> 11:28.320
Guys, I've got this.

11:29.040 --> 11:29.540
Okay.

11:30.720 --> 11:31.920
Just cut your fingers off.

11:31.920 --> 11:37.360
No, wait, you specifically said in your question

11:37.360 --> 11:39.440
that you need those to scoop up the peanut butter.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.720
Cut your fingers off and replace it with spoons.

11:42.720 --> 11:44.880
This is like a snake eating its own tail

11:44.880 --> 11:46.880
because if you were to stop eating the peanut butter,

11:46.880 --> 11:49.120
you could probably fit your fat ass hand in there.

11:50.880 --> 11:52.720
Oh man, I love that peanut butter.

11:52.720 --> 11:55.680
It's my only vice because I know when I eat it,

11:55.680 --> 11:57.520
it just goes straight to my hands.

11:57.520 --> 12:01.040
Is this, I'm imagining like a fucking ever long scenario.

12:01.040 --> 12:01.540
Yes.

12:01.540 --> 12:02.400
Putting out here.

12:02.400 --> 12:05.680
A moment on the lips, forever on the fingertips.

12:05.680 --> 12:06.560
There it is.

12:10.560 --> 12:11.760
Peanut butter's good.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.880
Yahoo Answers user Asher responded,

12:14.880 --> 12:17.040
break or dislocate your thumb.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.560
Then your hand will slide right in

12:18.560 --> 12:20.320
and you can still use your other fingers

12:20.320 --> 12:21.920
to scoop out the peanut butter.

12:21.920 --> 12:23.600
Why not just cut open the jar?

12:25.200 --> 12:25.700
Yeah.

12:25.700 --> 12:27.040
Listen, if you're gonna do that,

12:27.040 --> 12:28.400
listen, if she had a knife,

12:28.400 --> 12:30.240
listen, if she had access to a knife,

12:30.240 --> 12:31.680
she wouldn't need to put her whole mitt

12:31.680 --> 12:33.280
in the peanut butter jar.

12:33.280 --> 12:34.640
God knows she's not allowed

12:34.640 --> 12:36.400
to have sharp objects on the ward.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.240
I'm actually, I think that we could make

12:38.240 --> 12:42.000
a pretty compelling sequel to 127 Hours here.

12:43.440 --> 12:45.840
Or instead of it being Aaron Rolston

12:45.840 --> 12:48.720
getting trapped under a rock in a canyon

12:48.720 --> 12:50.240
and having to cut his own arm off.

12:50.880 --> 12:52.640
It's a really dumb person.

12:52.640 --> 12:55.200
That's like soups hungry for peanut butter.

12:55.200 --> 12:58.240
And halfway through she'd masturbate

12:58.240 --> 12:59.520
to a picture of pizza she took

12:59.520 --> 13:00.480
on her digital camera.

13:01.840 --> 13:02.720
Here's what I love.

13:02.720 --> 13:04.720
Her complaint is that her knife

13:04.720 --> 13:06.880
can't get to the peanut butter

13:06.880 --> 13:08.880
and she wants to slim her hand down.

13:08.880 --> 13:09.120
Yeah.

13:09.840 --> 13:11.760
Just smaller than a knife?

13:11.760 --> 13:12.720
Is that what she's saying?

13:14.080 --> 13:15.840
She wants Edward Scissorhands.

13:15.840 --> 13:19.520
Ah, that old chestnut.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.360
Edward peanut butter taste.

13:21.360 --> 13:23.040
Listen, sometimes tools,

13:23.040 --> 13:25.200
simple rudimentary tools,

13:25.200 --> 13:26.480
aren't enough to get the job done.

13:26.480 --> 13:29.520
Your finger is the most elegant tool

13:29.520 --> 13:30.560
that God ever made.

13:31.440 --> 13:33.120
The finger is the most elegant

13:33.120 --> 13:35.760
peanut butter scooping tool.

13:35.760 --> 13:38.240
It's a great intersection of flexibility.

13:38.240 --> 13:39.360
Haven't you seen the videos

13:39.360 --> 13:41.520
of the chimpanzee trying to get the thing,

13:41.520 --> 13:44.000
like the honey out of the beaker,

13:44.000 --> 13:45.760
and then a little kid tries to do it

13:45.760 --> 13:46.800
and the little kid can't do it

13:46.800 --> 13:48.240
because he's so fucking stupid,

13:48.240 --> 13:50.880
but the chimpanzee just dips his finger in there

13:50.880 --> 13:53.760
and it's like, mm, syrup.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.400
Can I show yours a little kid like that?

13:56.400 --> 13:58.080
Like he eats the little kid's honey too?

13:58.800 --> 13:59.920
Yeah, he goes to the little kid

13:59.920 --> 14:01.280
and he's like, give me that, you dumb fuck.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.760
Come here, you got some nits in your hair

14:05.760 --> 14:06.960
that I'm gonna eat.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.880
I'm protecting you now like my child.

14:08.880 --> 14:11.040
Your fingers are made,

14:11.040 --> 14:12.960
these fingers are made for scooping

14:12.960 --> 14:14.080
and that's just what they'll do.

14:16.160 --> 14:19.760
I would love to see this person's keyboard

14:19.760 --> 14:20.960
that they type this question down.

14:22.160 --> 14:23.280
Pretty sticky, right?

14:23.280 --> 14:25.920
We would have to agree, pretty overall, pretty sticky.

14:26.800 --> 14:30.320
We'd say it's stickiness rating is 10 out of 10.

14:30.320 --> 14:32.960
The P and B keys are like worn down demands

14:35.840 --> 14:38.240
for all the PB forums.

14:39.680 --> 14:41.440
I'd like to see the roof of her mouth.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.520
What's going on up there?

14:43.520 --> 14:45.520
Oh boy, can you do any tongue twisters?

14:45.520 --> 14:47.600
I cannot, not since the mid-70s.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.840
Ancient reservoirs of sweet peanut butter.

14:51.680 --> 14:53.920
There's kinds that they don't even make up there.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.920
There's Peter Pan up there.

14:58.400 --> 15:00.800
So in closing, kill yourself, I guess.

15:00.800 --> 15:05.200
I don't know, I don't have a good answer for this person.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.360
They've set themselves up with a logistical conundrum.

15:07.360 --> 15:10.320
You gotta pick your favorite PB scooping thing.

15:11.360 --> 15:12.240
Pick your favorite.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.120
Thank you, I think they understood

15:15.120 --> 15:17.760
what I meant when I said PB scooping thing.

15:17.760 --> 15:20.080
All right, no, like you've bought into the reality

15:20.080 --> 15:21.840
that this person has absorbed you into.

15:21.840 --> 15:22.320
You pick?

15:22.320 --> 15:24.960
The best PB scooping thing is like a spoon or something.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.120
Choose your favorite thing, cut all the others off.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.720
You only need that one.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.680
That would actually streamline the hand enough

15:31.680 --> 15:33.520
that they can get whatever their favorite,

15:33.520 --> 15:34.640
I don't wanna bias them,

15:35.840 --> 15:37.680
but they could get their favorite

15:37.680 --> 15:40.960
peanut butter scooping finger, slice the rest off,

15:40.960 --> 15:45.040
and just make like the perfect PB tool.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.360
Like a hand probiscus, like, yeah.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.920
Could they get another mouth on their finger?

15:51.920 --> 15:52.720
Is that possible?

15:53.840 --> 15:56.240
Hey, science, can you do this for us?

15:56.240 --> 15:57.040
It's science?

15:57.040 --> 15:59.840
I'm tired of lifting it all the way to my mouth.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.920
If I could just put my probiscus.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.680
I need to cut out the middle man

16:03.680 --> 16:05.600
and just turn my middle finger into a probiscus,

16:06.480 --> 16:09.120
which I can use to sop up all the sweet PB.

16:09.120 --> 16:10.800
I'm not sad.

16:10.800 --> 16:11.440
This question is gonna be sad.

16:11.440 --> 16:13.520
I've been sad for about two and a half minutes.

16:13.520 --> 16:14.160
I'm hungry.

16:15.840 --> 16:18.160
I'm headed to my friend's bachelor party

16:18.160 --> 16:23.680
for a weekend of food, fun, five beverages, and frivolity.

16:23.680 --> 16:26.720
I plan on driving out with a friend of mine

16:26.720 --> 16:30.240
who lives in town since the party is two hours away.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.160
The only problem is that the party starts

16:32.160 --> 16:33.440
pretty early in the morning.

16:33.440 --> 16:34.880
We're playing mini golf at nine.

16:35.840 --> 16:37.680
And now the friend I'm driving with

16:37.680 --> 16:40.560
refuses to wake up early enough to get us there on time.

16:40.560 --> 16:42.320
I would really like to be there for the whole party

16:42.320 --> 16:44.000
since the groom is a good friend of mine

16:44.000 --> 16:45.280
and I'm sure it will be a good time.

16:45.840 --> 16:47.200
With rising gas prices,

16:47.200 --> 16:49.040
it would be an expensive weekend to drive alone.

16:49.040 --> 16:52.000
How can I make it to the party on time,

16:52.000 --> 16:53.520
worrisome in Wisconsin?

16:54.160 --> 16:57.520
Finally, some advice that everyone can apply to their lives.

16:57.520 --> 17:00.720
How do I make it to the bachelor mini golf

17:01.440 --> 17:03.600
by myself early enough in the morning?

17:03.600 --> 17:07.280
Tell your friend that you will make a little bed for him,

17:07.280 --> 17:10.720
a little nap zone right there in the passenger seat.

17:10.720 --> 17:12.560
And then you go up to his room.

17:13.280 --> 17:14.480
He has to give you his house keys.

17:15.040 --> 17:18.960
You go up to his room, you open the door,

17:18.960 --> 17:25.920
you lovingly, like a parent whose child has fallen asleep

17:25.920 --> 17:27.360
watching their favorite Disney film.

17:29.760 --> 17:30.720
Look at his face.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.120
He's tuckered, plump tuckered.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.560
You've known each other for years.

17:34.560 --> 17:36.880
Just scoop him up and hold him close.

17:36.880 --> 17:37.840
Make sure he's big.

17:37.840 --> 17:40.960
Get his banky, get his winky, get his boinky.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.560
Pick all four of them up, himself included,

17:44.560 --> 17:45.600
and carry him down.

17:47.120 --> 17:49.680
Oh, oh, oh, oh, careful.

17:49.680 --> 17:51.360
There's a roller skate on the step stone.

17:51.360 --> 17:52.960
Oh good, you missed it.

17:52.960 --> 17:55.520
And then just lay him down in the passenger seat

17:55.520 --> 17:56.480
and stroke his hair.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.800
Maybe turn on some soothing music.

18:00.800 --> 18:04.240
Maybe some raffy, some Sharon Loveson Bram.

18:04.240 --> 18:06.960
I know you've got some Norah Jones in that CD box.

18:06.960 --> 18:13.040
Don't know why you're driving to mini golf this early.

18:13.040 --> 18:14.160
Something like that.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.400
Put that on and just let him sleep the whole trip.

18:17.120 --> 18:17.760
Done.

18:17.760 --> 18:18.960
He doesn't even have to wake up.

18:18.960 --> 18:23.840
He'll wake up and oh, what a good mini golf.

18:23.840 --> 18:24.800
Like what could be better?

18:25.920 --> 18:28.400
I want to throw out one change to that.

18:28.400 --> 18:28.960
Okay.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.160
Don't tell him beforehand.

18:31.760 --> 18:32.320
Where am I?

18:32.320 --> 18:35.760
And maybe don't take him to mini golf.

18:35.760 --> 18:38.560
Take him somewhere else and let him find his way to mini golf.

18:38.560 --> 18:40.720
But also steal his wallet and cell phone and keys.

18:41.600 --> 18:45.200
Okay, so you're creating more of a hitcher scenario

18:45.200 --> 18:48.480
where it's like a life or death test.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.800
And just leave a note pinned to a shirt that says

18:50.800 --> 18:53.840
waking up early doesn't seem like such a bad idea anymore, does it?

18:54.480 --> 18:54.960
Good luck.

18:55.840 --> 18:56.560
Call if you die.

18:58.320 --> 19:00.800
I think just let him sleep and you can take him

19:00.800 --> 19:02.240
and everything will be fine.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.400
And then when you wake up, just make him pay for gas.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.680
Tell him he can sleep the whole time.

19:05.680 --> 19:08.400
I do have to say, though, whoever this bachelor is or-

19:08.400 --> 19:10.400
He's the worst fucking worst fucking guy on the planet.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.680
What the fuck?

19:11.680 --> 19:14.160
Who makes people wake up that early?

19:14.160 --> 19:16.480
I know I'm already like super inconveniencing you

19:16.480 --> 19:17.760
by making you come to my wedding.

19:17.760 --> 19:21.680
But also you're going to drive two hours to come play fucking mini golf.

19:21.680 --> 19:24.000
Like sorry about it being so early.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.080
It was the best tea time I could get.

19:26.080 --> 19:26.960
Yeah.

19:26.960 --> 19:31.360
Do you know before my friend Tommy Red's wedding, the day of,

19:31.360 --> 19:33.120
he did a traditional bachelor party.

19:33.120 --> 19:36.160
And then the day of the wedding before he actually went and got married,

19:36.160 --> 19:38.640
we went to the zoo to watch monkeys jerk it.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.240
That's 100% true.

19:42.240 --> 19:43.600
We did that, then we left.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.000
That was a pretty good start to the wedded bliss, I guess.

19:46.560 --> 19:50.320
Mini golf is like the shittiest bachelor party, I think.

19:50.320 --> 19:51.840
I don't think it's just mini golf.

19:51.840 --> 19:53.520
I think they're starting with mini golf.

19:53.520 --> 19:54.720
That's so early, though.

19:54.720 --> 19:59.120
If you start partying at nine o'clock, you can't party all day.

19:59.120 --> 20:00.080
Maybe that's the idea.

20:01.120 --> 20:03.520
Do you think it's sexy mini golf?

20:03.520 --> 20:08.960
Like there are ladies there that dance while they play it.

20:08.960 --> 20:11.360
To try to distract them even with their hips and shaking and stuff?

20:11.360 --> 20:11.920
Yeah, yeah.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.880
So like instead of a windmill, it's like a sexy lady.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.600
And maybe she's like swinging her arms.

20:17.600 --> 20:24.160
Like just like at the end of the game, they'll put out.

20:24.160 --> 20:25.360
Please go to the next question.

20:26.880 --> 20:30.000
Last night, I ordered delivery for my local eatery.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.960
When the food showed up, it happened to be delivered by a friend of mine who I met this

20:32.960 --> 20:33.460
semester.

20:34.160 --> 20:38.480
We chatted a bit, and when I wondered what I was supposed to do for a tip, it's weird

20:38.480 --> 20:41.520
tipping a friend because it's like paying them for hanging out.

20:41.520 --> 20:43.520
Am I supposed to tip more because he's a friend?

20:44.080 --> 20:46.480
What do I do if this situation rises again?

20:46.480 --> 20:47.840
Okay, Ben.

20:47.840 --> 20:48.560
That's from Ben.

20:48.560 --> 20:53.840
Ben, it may have seemed weird to you, but I'm pretty sure he probably wanted that tip.

20:53.840 --> 20:55.200
Yeah, I'm sorry.

20:55.200 --> 20:56.960
The answer is you tip more.

20:57.520 --> 21:01.520
Yeah, because like he's your friend, so it's an opportunity to give him money guilt free.

21:01.520 --> 21:05.040
So you should probably just give him like probably give him a good amount of money.

21:05.040 --> 21:09.760
I also like how that question evolved from it was some dude that I met this semester,

21:09.760 --> 21:12.880
but he's like my best friend, so I shouldn't have to tip him, right?

21:12.880 --> 21:14.640
Like we're too close for that.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.160
I think you want.

21:16.160 --> 21:16.880
Here's the thing.

21:16.880 --> 21:18.640
You just want to get it's not weird.

21:18.640 --> 21:23.280
You just want to give them because it's like it's their job, you know, so they want to

21:23.280 --> 21:28.240
get paid to do it like so just give them a nicer tip than you would normally give to

21:28.240 --> 21:34.720
somebody and I think that they'll have warm feelings about you and they won't break up

21:34.720 --> 21:36.800
with you break up with your friendship.

21:36.800 --> 21:41.680
And I tell you as a dude who delivered food when I rolled up to a friend's house.

21:42.560 --> 21:47.520
In my mind, like it was a big checkmark of now I know I'm getting a good tip because

21:48.160 --> 21:50.480
they're my friend, you know, they're going to appreciate that.

21:50.480 --> 21:51.520
Hey, I know this guy.

21:51.520 --> 21:54.160
I know this guy, so if you were like, oh, this is weird.

21:54.800 --> 21:56.880
Nope, could we could we play on that?

21:56.880 --> 22:01.440
Could if you're like a food deliverer and a small town, can you just be friends with

22:01.440 --> 22:01.920
everyone?

22:01.920 --> 22:05.120
So people like, oh, oh, Ben's here.

22:05.120 --> 22:07.760
I think that's a good idea.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.280
Let's make it rain on that fool.

22:11.120 --> 22:13.920
Let's take it one step further and get them so paid.

22:13.920 --> 22:18.960
Set up a delivery service for your friends or like say that they're sitting around.

22:18.960 --> 22:19.920
They want some Taco Bell.

22:19.920 --> 22:23.360
They call you, you drive to Taco Bell, pick up their food and bring it to them.

22:23.360 --> 22:24.160
And they tip you.

22:25.360 --> 22:31.120
You get a whole network of people at your at your food station, at your food stand,

22:31.120 --> 22:36.320
so that you have a person for every single person that lives in your town.

22:37.280 --> 22:39.520
Hey, anybody know Jerry?

22:39.520 --> 22:40.640
Like, I know Jerry.

22:40.640 --> 22:41.680
Like, go get him.

22:41.680 --> 22:43.680
Go get his go get his tips.

22:43.680 --> 22:44.320
Go get some.

22:44.320 --> 22:45.200
Get that's on.

22:45.200 --> 22:45.840
Bring it to him.

22:45.840 --> 22:52.160
So how embarrassing was what this person ordered that they say they ordered delivery from a

22:52.160 --> 22:53.200
local eatery?

22:53.200 --> 22:54.000
What did you get?

22:55.200 --> 22:56.720
Because there's something you're hiding here.

22:56.720 --> 22:58.160
You're covering up something, Ben.

22:59.120 --> 23:00.480
I'm a good enough detective.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.680
I'm a good enough private dick to know when someone's hiding a food choice.

23:03.680 --> 23:04.480
Oh, maybe that's it.

23:05.200 --> 23:08.000
Hey, hey, Ben, here's your novelty dick shaped pizza.

23:09.280 --> 23:10.480
Happy Valentine's Day.

23:11.040 --> 23:12.960
This is the first one we've made of these.

23:12.960 --> 23:15.920
Is there a dick shaped pizza that's not a novelty?

23:15.920 --> 23:18.800
Here's your average boring dick shaped pizza.

23:19.920 --> 23:21.200
Here's your run of the mill.

23:22.480 --> 23:27.200
Um, I, uh, yeah, just give him a give him a tasty, tasty tip.

23:27.200 --> 23:31.040
And I think that they'll really they'll you'll be friends.

23:31.040 --> 23:31.520
Griffin.

23:32.880 --> 23:36.080
You got any more of those Yahoo answers just sort of lying around?

23:36.080 --> 23:37.200
Yeah, how about this one?

23:37.200 --> 23:37.680
How about this?

23:37.680 --> 23:39.520
This one was sent in by Haley Keller.

23:39.520 --> 23:40.560
Thank you, Haley.

23:40.560 --> 23:41.760
Thanks, Hales.

23:41.760 --> 23:43.360
It's by Yahoo answers user.

23:44.400 --> 23:46.800
Iggy is being constantly reported.

23:46.800 --> 23:47.280
Thanks.

23:49.600 --> 23:53.920
Who asks, do you hate people who urinate loudly?

23:56.320 --> 23:58.720
I am listening to it right now.

23:59.680 --> 24:05.120
And it's taking all I have to not to start shouting at them to piss quietly.

24:05.120 --> 24:06.800
As I know that would sound strange.

24:06.800 --> 24:10.240
And I don't feel like I should be judging or trying to control the way people urinate

24:10.240 --> 24:13.040
when they are presumably relaxing and doing something private.

24:13.040 --> 24:16.000
But it's just a pet peeve, you might say.

24:16.880 --> 24:19.040
I can't stand the noise when it happens to me.

24:19.040 --> 24:23.040
So I can't understand people who urinate so loud that it sounds like the roof is going

24:23.040 --> 24:24.640
to cave in from water pressure.

24:24.640 --> 24:25.280
Oh, God.

24:25.840 --> 24:27.840
I don't mean normal urinating, by the way.

24:27.840 --> 24:29.440
I mean loud.

24:29.440 --> 24:31.280
Yes, I realize this question is weird.

24:33.120 --> 24:35.600
Jimmy, Jimmy, turn down the nozzle.

24:35.600 --> 24:36.240
Yeah, dog.

24:37.120 --> 24:38.320
You're blowing my ears out.

24:38.320 --> 24:41.440
Narrow your aperture.

24:41.440 --> 24:46.080
Like, what kind of pressure are you dealing with?

24:46.080 --> 24:47.600
When was the last time you peed?

24:48.720 --> 24:50.240
I do know what he's talking about, though.

24:50.240 --> 24:52.480
Not from the annoyance, not the annoyance.

24:52.480 --> 24:58.400
But you go into you go to the bathroom, you see like some giant 60 year old Greek dude.

24:58.400 --> 25:00.080
That's who it always seems to be.

25:00.080 --> 25:04.160
And he'll just open up like, whoa, are you dumping out a big gulp in there?

25:04.160 --> 25:04.960
What's going on?

25:04.960 --> 25:09.840
I want to I want to go a little bit deeper and set this question.

25:09.840 --> 25:10.880
I bet you do.

25:10.880 --> 25:11.760
Gross.

25:11.760 --> 25:12.000
What?

25:12.720 --> 25:13.040
What?

25:13.040 --> 25:18.400
OK, I want to talk about technology in the modern day where this gentleman is able to

25:18.400 --> 25:23.600
listen to really loud urination and simultaneously ask Yahoo answers about it.

25:24.240 --> 25:26.480
I feel like there needs to be some distance between those two events.

25:26.480 --> 25:29.520
I presume he was just dictating it to his secretary.

25:29.520 --> 25:32.320
Is that is that not accurate?

25:32.320 --> 25:40.320
Margaret, take notes dictated, but not read from Stephen Billshop.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.960
Can can you can you control?

25:44.960 --> 25:46.320
Can you control your pressure?

25:46.880 --> 25:49.120
Oh, you got to get that tantric peeing.

25:50.160 --> 25:51.040
Oh, God.

25:51.040 --> 25:51.600
Oh, no.

25:57.840 --> 25:59.040
OK, so we get it.

25:59.040 --> 26:00.480
It's not like a super soaker.

26:00.480 --> 26:04.240
We're like, I pump it four times and it only goes 50.

26:04.240 --> 26:07.760
Yeah, if you're if you're in the studio, his thing is like, I want to go take a pee.

26:08.320 --> 26:12.000
Usually your answer is like, I'm going to go to the DMV or go get a hotel room or something

26:12.960 --> 26:14.400
because I can't I can't wait for that.

26:14.400 --> 26:14.880
I'll see you.

26:14.880 --> 26:15.520
I'll see you tomorrow.

26:15.520 --> 26:15.840
Stay.

26:15.840 --> 26:19.040
No, but the nice thing, the nice thing is he has so much control over it.

26:19.040 --> 26:20.560
He can do it in a second.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.080
Oh, right.

26:22.080 --> 26:22.640
He can just walk in.

26:22.640 --> 26:23.140
Done.

26:24.160 --> 26:26.800
It sounds like Niagara Falls.

26:26.800 --> 26:30.160
But it sounds like Niagara Falls.

26:30.160 --> 26:33.120
It sounds like somebody throwing a water balloon in a fat person.

26:33.120 --> 26:35.280
It's just like done out.

26:37.600 --> 26:39.040
I do feel bad for Sting.

26:39.040 --> 26:43.200
I think he's got a bum rap because everybody talks about his tantric sex

26:43.200 --> 26:46.400
and nobody remembers his his his hit music.

26:47.680 --> 26:50.400
You know, Fields of Gold was written about his urination.

26:50.400 --> 26:50.960
Stop it.

26:51.520 --> 26:52.400
It's true.

26:52.400 --> 26:55.760
To be fair, he is the poster boy of tantric anything, right?

26:55.760 --> 26:58.320
You hear the word tantric and immediately go to Sting.

26:58.320 --> 26:59.680
I bet he loves that.

26:59.680 --> 27:01.600
Have you ever played tantric mini golf with him?

27:02.560 --> 27:04.160
That's why you have to start at nine.

27:04.160 --> 27:06.480
Otherwise, it takes slightly longer than normal mini golf.

27:06.480 --> 27:07.040
Yeah.

27:07.040 --> 27:08.000
Sting, holy fuck.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.120
You got you.

27:09.120 --> 27:10.880
You shot a seven hundred and thirty.

27:13.120 --> 27:14.960
How did you even do this?

27:14.960 --> 27:15.840
It's next week.

27:17.840 --> 27:18.800
We missed the wedding.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.000
We missed the wedding, Sting.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.320
Sting, we missed the wedding by six whole days.

27:22.320 --> 27:24.000
How are you so bad at this?

27:24.000 --> 27:27.520
Do you guys get a hint of jealousy from this question?

27:28.720 --> 27:30.960
Doesn't it seem like this person wishes they could have

27:31.520 --> 27:32.880
just a column of pee,

27:32.880 --> 27:34.080
just a jet of urine,

27:34.640 --> 27:37.200
a defiant blast of urine,

27:37.200 --> 27:40.400
just like just something that like picks him up like a little kid

27:40.400 --> 27:42.480
holding a fire hose in an 80s movie,

27:42.480 --> 27:44.560
just like spinning around, you know.

27:46.560 --> 27:49.040
Oh, speaking of making mouth noises,

27:49.040 --> 27:50.320
that's the guy I can't stand.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.840
Have the loudest urination you want.

27:51.840 --> 27:53.920
But I'm tired of these guys who start peeing and then go,

27:56.320 --> 27:57.680
like, what are they doing?

27:58.320 --> 28:00.400
Yeah, they're enjoying themselves.

28:01.520 --> 28:02.320
Is it time yet?

28:03.280 --> 28:04.480
It's so time, man.

28:04.480 --> 28:05.760
Like for the money zone?

28:05.760 --> 28:22.000
Yeah, like for the money zone.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.360
So this week, the money zone is another sponsorship.

28:26.240 --> 28:30.720
We are officially endorsing Alison Borges,

28:31.280 --> 28:33.280
a friend of the show, Alison Borges, I should say,

28:33.280 --> 28:36.880
to be named the official graduate.

28:37.600 --> 28:39.840
I want to say the official 2011 graduate,

28:39.840 --> 28:42.080
because we're probably going to get a lot of other graduates,

28:42.080 --> 28:45.520
but the official 2011 graduate of my brother,

28:45.520 --> 28:46.720
my brother and me.

28:46.720 --> 28:50.240
And we are forsaking all other graduates.

28:50.240 --> 28:52.480
That seems like a blessing and a curse.

28:52.480 --> 28:55.200
The amount of pressure that Alison has on her now

28:55.200 --> 28:56.880
to live up to that title.

28:56.880 --> 28:58.800
To succeed, right?

28:58.800 --> 29:01.120
You think she can slap that bitch on a resume?

29:01.120 --> 29:01.600
Oh, yeah.

29:02.400 --> 29:03.040
Oh, yeah.

29:03.040 --> 29:04.880
Well, so she got a degree in zoology, right?

29:04.880 --> 29:07.360
So when she rolls up to a zoo,

29:08.240 --> 29:10.240
I mean, it's the first thing that springs to mind,

29:10.240 --> 29:12.880
and she says, hey, Mr. Zookeeper,

29:12.880 --> 29:14.880
you should hire me to take care of the monkeys

29:14.880 --> 29:15.840
who are jerking it,

29:15.840 --> 29:18.240
because I am the official graduate

29:18.240 --> 29:19.600
of my brother, my brother and me.

29:20.720 --> 29:22.080
Class of 2000 in heaven.

29:25.040 --> 29:26.560
Well, that makes it sound like she's dead.

29:27.440 --> 29:28.240
Isn't she?

29:28.240 --> 29:29.280
Is she not dead?

29:29.280 --> 29:31.360
Now that college is over, it might as well be.

29:31.360 --> 29:31.760
Oh, god.

29:31.760 --> 29:33.040
It's all downhill from here.

29:33.040 --> 29:35.360
You made the biggest mistake of your life.

29:35.360 --> 29:37.360
Haven't you seen Van Wilder?

29:37.360 --> 29:39.280
You gotta stay in college, you guys.

29:40.160 --> 29:41.040
As long as you can.

29:42.400 --> 29:43.920
Where'd all my friends go?

29:43.920 --> 29:46.160
Ah, that's right, college ended.

29:46.160 --> 29:47.360
I miss all of them.

29:47.360 --> 29:49.440
Why do I only see them at lunch

29:49.440 --> 29:50.560
at the Indian restaurant?

29:51.280 --> 29:52.240
Because you're old now.

29:52.880 --> 29:53.840
You're an old person.

29:53.840 --> 29:55.760
I'm disappointed in you, Alison,

29:55.760 --> 29:59.360
but I'm proud of you and your friend,

29:59.360 --> 30:03.600
and your special somebody, Nick Coffin,

30:04.640 --> 30:09.120
wanted us to name you our official graduate.

30:09.120 --> 30:13.360
So congratulations, and Griffin,

30:13.360 --> 30:15.120
let's move on to the next question.

30:15.120 --> 30:17.360
No, but I think there was a thing.

30:17.360 --> 30:20.000
I think, well, I'm looking at this.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.240
I'm pretty sure there was a special note

30:22.240 --> 30:23.040
on this question.

30:23.040 --> 30:25.120
Not seeing any notes.

30:25.120 --> 30:27.840
That Nick Coffin specifically wanted you

30:27.840 --> 30:29.280
to do the jingle for Alison.

30:31.600 --> 30:35.840
So let's go ahead and let's get out that sixth string.

30:35.840 --> 30:37.360
And kick it off one time.

30:37.360 --> 30:38.960
Let's pluck them out.

30:38.960 --> 30:40.160
I don't know how to,

30:41.120 --> 30:43.200
I don't play guitar like you do, though.

30:43.200 --> 30:45.200
Get out your sixth string and let's pluck one out.

30:46.160 --> 30:48.240
You always sort of freestyle.

30:48.240 --> 30:53.680
Yeah, going well.

31:00.080 --> 31:01.440
This is a pretty chord progression.

31:05.440 --> 31:08.320
Shy, la, la, la, la, la, don't be shy.

31:09.440 --> 31:13.120
Why, why you gotta graduate?

31:13.120 --> 31:17.360
Shy, la, la, la, la, la, don't be shy.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.640
You gotta don't play or hate.

31:22.640 --> 31:30.160
Whoa, there's some science doing it across the room.

31:32.320 --> 31:34.720
Go and find some gold doubloons.

31:34.720 --> 31:45.280
Come on, learn about goats.

31:46.400 --> 31:47.200
Graduate.

31:52.800 --> 31:54.160
Study books.

31:54.160 --> 31:56.480
Don't mind their dirty looks.

31:56.480 --> 31:58.800
You gotta graduate.

31:58.800 --> 32:03.680
Whoa, la, la, la, la, la, get some paper.

32:04.640 --> 32:05.920
Earn some cash.

32:06.720 --> 32:08.720
Don't discriminate.

32:08.720 --> 32:11.520
Whoa, whoa, come on, Alison.

32:11.520 --> 32:16.800
Wear that robe and learn about any animals around with robe.

32:19.280 --> 32:19.840
Antelopes.

32:21.840 --> 32:24.240
Whoa, whoa, come on, Alison.

32:24.240 --> 32:26.000
We're proud of you.

32:26.000 --> 32:30.560
Don't let us down to just like a cockatoo.

32:39.280 --> 32:40.880
Oh, yeah.

32:40.880 --> 32:41.680
Nailed it.

32:41.680 --> 32:42.640
Chunky ending.

32:43.680 --> 32:44.720
That was good, right?

32:46.160 --> 32:47.200
Two notes.

32:47.200 --> 32:48.480
Like Stevie Ray Yon.

32:50.000 --> 32:50.560
Two notes.

32:52.240 --> 32:54.240
You did great with all the animals.

32:54.240 --> 32:57.600
You named at least two animals in there, one fake animal.

32:59.120 --> 33:02.000
Also, the gold doubloons part, you kind of lost me a little bit.

33:04.640 --> 33:08.640
I did just want to say gold doubloons did not have a good connector there.

33:08.640 --> 33:12.480
I assumed that was because she was going to study in South America and, you know,

33:12.480 --> 33:14.880
Cortez and gold doubloons and everything.

33:14.880 --> 33:15.360
Mayans.

33:19.360 --> 33:20.000
Hard to say.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.120
So congratulations, Alison.

33:21.120 --> 33:29.200
How about another question from our dear friends out there on the internet?

33:29.200 --> 33:33.760
Just a reminder, if you want to send us a question, mbnbam at maximumfun.org.

33:33.760 --> 33:39.520
Our form spring is formspring.me forward slash mbnbam, or you can use Twitter.

33:40.400 --> 33:42.320
Just use the mbnbam hashtag.

33:42.320 --> 33:47.920
If you want us to take you to the money zone, you just got to contact Teresa at maximumfun.org.

33:47.920 --> 33:49.520
That's Teresa with an H.

33:49.520 --> 33:52.400
It's a hundred dollars for a personal message like that one right there,

33:52.400 --> 33:54.400
or $200 for a business message.

33:54.400 --> 33:58.640
But either way, you still get a jingle to the tune of a Disney song.

33:59.520 --> 34:02.080
I'm pretty renowned writer in my neck of the woods.

34:02.080 --> 34:04.560
So I often have people run up to me on the street,

34:04.560 --> 34:07.920
show a manuscript into my hand and breathlessly explain.

34:07.920 --> 34:12.640
There's might be the next great American novel with a little help from me.

34:12.640 --> 34:13.760
I usually decline.

34:13.760 --> 34:16.960
But when one of my bestest buddies asked me to read his own work, I couldn't refuse.

34:16.960 --> 34:21.760
My question for you guys, how do I let my friend know that he sucks

34:21.760 --> 34:25.360
and just pinned a pile of shit without saying it like that?

34:25.360 --> 34:31.200
Also, he's a little dyslexic, feeling preemptively sucky,

34:31.920 --> 34:37.120
or shitty, sorry, feeling preemptively shitty in Chicago.

34:37.120 --> 34:38.560
Man, this sucks.

34:39.440 --> 34:42.800
Hey, listen, if he listens to our show, just let us tell him.

34:43.440 --> 34:44.480
We just did.

34:44.480 --> 34:47.280
Are you a friend of a prolific author in Chicago?

34:47.280 --> 34:48.880
Because you're probably bad at writing.

34:48.880 --> 34:50.720
Are you slightly dyslexic?

34:50.720 --> 34:51.200
You suck.

34:52.320 --> 34:53.840
You're not good at writing.

34:53.840 --> 34:56.800
Maybe audiobooks is the way to go for you.

34:56.800 --> 35:01.040
Maybe you could give him just like a positive

35:01.040 --> 35:04.800
and then two negatives into infinity.

35:04.800 --> 35:06.720
Like if you're like, I really like the title,

35:07.520 --> 35:10.400
but your characters are all shitty and your punctuation is terrible.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.640
So you're saying you give him one step forward

35:12.640 --> 35:15.280
and two steps back until he hangs himself.

35:15.280 --> 35:15.920
Right.

35:15.920 --> 35:18.000
So you give him like, you say like,

35:18.000 --> 35:21.040
I really like the paper you used,

35:21.040 --> 35:22.960
but everything on it is just the worst.

35:22.960 --> 35:23.760
Great font.

35:25.120 --> 35:26.080
Terrible story.

35:28.560 --> 35:31.280
You spelled many of the words correctly.

35:31.840 --> 35:34.720
But this is clearly the plot to Weekend at Bernie's.

35:35.520 --> 35:36.960
You are just copying Bernie's style.

35:36.960 --> 35:42.800
What you've done here is you've written a book adaptation of Weekend at Bernie's.

35:42.800 --> 35:45.120
But bad, so bad.

35:45.120 --> 35:47.040
But like bad, like super dyslexic.

35:48.480 --> 35:51.680
Like the most dyslexic version there could be.

35:52.240 --> 35:56.160
Everyone knows that in Weekend at Bernie's, Bernie was dead.

35:56.160 --> 36:00.320
Well, my book presupposes maybe he isn't.

36:01.440 --> 36:03.600
I would read that book, by the way, if he came back.

36:03.600 --> 36:06.400
What if he came back and started solving crimes?

36:06.400 --> 36:07.520
He was a detective.

36:07.520 --> 36:09.440
Oh, but like afterlife crimes.

36:09.440 --> 36:10.400
Afterlife crimes.

36:10.400 --> 36:10.640
Right.

36:11.440 --> 36:15.120
Like Beetlejuice basically mixed with Dead Men Don't Wear a Plan.

36:15.120 --> 36:16.240
Something like that.

36:16.240 --> 36:16.960
Exactly.

36:16.960 --> 36:17.280
Like Medium.

36:17.280 --> 36:18.320
I've watched that.

36:18.320 --> 36:20.080
Like the TV show Medium?

36:20.080 --> 36:21.040
Like Medium.

36:21.040 --> 36:22.320
Like the TV show Medium.

36:22.320 --> 36:23.440
Or like The Closer.

36:25.680 --> 36:26.800
What are we doing?

36:26.800 --> 36:27.760
Are we just randomly?

36:28.800 --> 36:30.240
Maybe it's like Saving Grace.

36:30.800 --> 36:32.400
Guys, guys, guys.

36:32.400 --> 36:34.400
Maybe it's like The Ghost Whisperer.

36:34.960 --> 36:35.840
Travis, Justin.

36:35.840 --> 36:36.560
Yeah?

36:36.560 --> 36:36.800
Yeah.

36:37.440 --> 36:38.000
Cold Case.

36:43.440 --> 36:46.480
So tell your friend to watch Cold Case.

36:47.040 --> 36:50.560
Hey, here's one that I always like to use.

36:51.120 --> 36:53.520
Why is the burden of truth placed on you?

36:54.160 --> 36:59.520
Clearly people throughout this person's life have told them that they are good,

36:59.520 --> 37:00.960
that they're better than they are.

37:00.960 --> 37:03.760
Why can't you just pass that buck?

37:03.760 --> 37:05.760
Pass it on up the drain.

37:05.760 --> 37:07.120
Say like, yeah, this is good.

37:07.120 --> 37:07.840
I like it.

37:07.840 --> 37:08.960
I like reading it.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.560
I would give it to someone else.

37:10.560 --> 37:11.280
See what they think.

37:12.480 --> 37:18.320
You could also always switch for the lesser douche move of saying you never got a chance to read it.

37:19.760 --> 37:20.960
Like just stay out of it.

37:20.960 --> 37:23.360
And maybe you're the jerk who couldn't take the time to read it,

37:23.360 --> 37:26.160
but you're not the jerk who has to lie to his friend or tell him he's crappy.

37:26.960 --> 37:31.600
Yeah, because it's not worth sacrificing the friendship for the truth.

37:32.880 --> 37:33.600
You know what?

37:33.600 --> 37:34.800
Here's another thing to think about.

37:35.520 --> 37:37.360
Snooki just published a book.

37:37.360 --> 37:41.120
Like shit goes out all the time that people like.

37:41.120 --> 37:43.520
There's no reason to say people won't like it just because it sucks.

37:44.080 --> 37:45.360
Lots of things that suck.

37:45.360 --> 37:50.800
But you could have been the one person who like could have avoided that whole situation.

37:52.320 --> 37:55.040
See, that's where I think it gets tricky because as his friend,

37:55.760 --> 37:57.440
is it his duty to say,

37:57.440 --> 38:00.960
hey, this should probably end with you and I,

38:00.960 --> 38:02.720
and you probably shouldn't show this to anyone else

38:02.720 --> 38:04.720
because I think it needs a lot of work.

38:05.280 --> 38:06.240
What's the harm though?

38:06.240 --> 38:10.160
Like it's not going to be any worse if he's just going to tell him that he sucks.

38:10.160 --> 38:13.920
Like it's not going to be any worse than some agent like him not being able to get traction on it.

38:15.120 --> 38:18.560
Well, I think it's because like this dude is very clearly a respected

38:18.560 --> 38:20.560
writer in his neck of the woods, as he says.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.800
And like, it seems like as an artist,

38:22.800 --> 38:26.480
it's his job to make sure that good art is being produced.

38:27.280 --> 38:30.480
Yeah, but his is that friendship responsibility comes first.

38:30.480 --> 38:33.600
So yeah, I'll agree with that.

38:33.600 --> 38:34.240
Lie to him.

38:34.800 --> 38:35.680
Just lie, right?

38:35.680 --> 38:36.240
Lie to me.

38:36.240 --> 38:37.600
That's another TV show.

38:37.600 --> 38:39.920
Or just let us do it.

38:39.920 --> 38:40.720
We don't care.

38:40.720 --> 38:41.520
Hey, Kevin.

38:42.160 --> 38:42.880
Oh, it's amazing.

38:43.440 --> 38:44.560
Do you did a great job.

38:44.560 --> 38:46.080
Take some night classes maybe.

38:46.080 --> 38:47.360
Yeah, but I think you're close.

38:47.360 --> 38:48.160
I think you're really close.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.360
It's really good.

38:49.360 --> 38:50.720
Oh, I can feel it.

38:51.280 --> 38:53.840
Maybe just change a couple of the character names

38:53.840 --> 38:57.120
and like locations and like the events that happen.

38:57.120 --> 38:58.640
Yeah, like you're really close to me.

38:58.640 --> 39:00.640
I'm not sure this feels like a script to me, though.

39:00.640 --> 39:04.720
To me, it feels like an episode of CatDog.

39:04.720 --> 39:06.400
And maybe with just some reworking,

39:07.440 --> 39:10.240
you could have a CatDog script published, printed,

39:10.800 --> 39:12.400
have your name in lights, I guess.

39:13.120 --> 39:14.000
You guys want a Yahoo?

39:14.640 --> 39:15.360
Yes, please.

39:15.360 --> 39:16.800
Yeah, I guess I do, actually.

39:17.360 --> 39:19.360
Unless there's like a super fresh question that you want.

39:19.360 --> 39:21.600
No, like I kind of want a Yahoo now for each.

39:21.600 --> 39:22.960
How about a Yahoo answer?

39:22.960 --> 39:25.280
This one was sent in by Gali Ayali.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.000
Thank you, Gali.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.280
It's by Yahoo Answers user, question mark, who asks,

39:31.120 --> 39:33.840
what is an awesome wedding theme?

39:35.280 --> 39:42.960
Example, Jamaica, Lion King, New York, Asia, et cetera.

39:42.960 --> 39:44.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

39:44.400 --> 39:45.200
Whoa, whoa.

39:45.200 --> 39:48.800
Hold on, did I mean to say prom, but instead I said wedding?

39:48.800 --> 39:51.040
Nope, that is the word.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.600
Can you give me those possibilities again?

39:53.600 --> 39:54.480
Let's run them back.

39:54.480 --> 39:56.160
Yeah, give me a replay.

39:56.160 --> 39:57.680
Let's play that tape back.

39:58.240 --> 39:59.360
Jamaica, okay?

39:59.360 --> 40:00.080
Weird.

40:00.080 --> 40:01.520
Lion King, dig it.

40:01.520 --> 40:02.720
New York, sure.

40:02.720 --> 40:05.600
Asia, it's kind of a lot of things is Asia.

40:05.600 --> 40:07.040
Asia is kind of a lot of things.

40:07.840 --> 40:11.200
Asia is very mini, unless you're talking about the band Asia,

40:11.200 --> 40:13.680
which that would be a pretty good wedding.

40:13.680 --> 40:14.400
Pretty baller.

40:15.440 --> 40:18.800
I think that those are all equally good.

40:18.800 --> 40:20.720
Those are all equally great themes.

40:20.720 --> 40:22.960
I'm gonna throw out the, it's a great test though,

40:22.960 --> 40:27.200
because if you have found an SO that agrees with you

40:27.200 --> 40:29.440
that you should have a Lion King themed wedding,

40:29.440 --> 40:31.200
you are meant for each other.

40:31.200 --> 40:32.960
I think you forgot some possibilities.

40:32.960 --> 40:37.200
There's Enchantment Under the Sea, Arabian Nights.

40:38.160 --> 40:39.120
Paradise City.

40:40.560 --> 40:43.200
One Night Only is one that would be good.

40:43.200 --> 40:44.320
Snow Princess.

40:44.320 --> 40:45.920
Snow Princess wedding.

40:45.920 --> 40:47.120
One Night in Bangkok.

40:48.240 --> 40:49.680
Well, I think Asia would.

40:49.680 --> 40:54.000
Well, First Night in Bangkok, actually, if it's a wedding, right?

40:54.000 --> 40:55.120
One Night in Paris.

40:56.480 --> 40:57.760
I think that that's a bad one.

40:57.760 --> 40:58.960
I don't think that that's very good.

41:00.240 --> 41:05.760
Do weddings have themes in the way that parade floats have themes?

41:05.760 --> 41:07.120
I was not aware of this.

41:07.120 --> 41:08.720
I did not know that weddings have-

41:08.720 --> 41:11.600
You get a wedding marshal and then the Shriners show up.

41:12.720 --> 41:16.880
Do you license the rights to your wedding out to whichever Disney property

41:16.880 --> 41:18.320
hasn't been produced there for a while?

41:18.320 --> 41:23.120
For Justin's wedding, the ring man was actually a Shriner in a little car.

41:23.120 --> 41:23.600
He drove it up.

41:23.600 --> 41:24.240
It was cool.

41:24.240 --> 41:25.040
Drove it up the aisle.

41:25.040 --> 41:26.080
Sorry, the what?

41:26.640 --> 41:27.680
The Shriner?

41:27.680 --> 41:28.640
No, no, no, before that.

41:29.600 --> 41:31.040
What position did he fill?

41:31.040 --> 41:31.920
He was the ring bearer.

41:32.800 --> 41:33.840
You said ring man.

41:36.480 --> 41:37.200
Did I?

41:37.200 --> 41:38.400
He was the ring man.

41:39.760 --> 41:43.760
Now, if you're talking about a wrestling themed wedding right now, I'm fucking there.

41:43.760 --> 41:44.240
No, no, no.

41:45.840 --> 41:46.800
We've done that.

41:46.800 --> 41:48.320
We've done that wedding.

41:48.320 --> 41:48.960
Now we're talking about-

41:48.960 --> 41:50.320
Now we're all about Asia.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.920
Is there some reason that your wedding can't be wedding themed?

42:00.720 --> 42:04.160
Answer one said, how about affordable?

42:04.160 --> 42:09.440
Or love, marriage, and commitment, not five-year-old's birthday party.

42:09.440 --> 42:18.080
My favorite, my favorite, saying vows, eating, drinking, and dancing as adults, not trying to

42:18.080 --> 42:19.120
recreate our prom.

42:19.120 --> 42:22.480
Oh, question mark, pick up your face.

42:23.680 --> 42:28.240
I hate it when the answers are, I've already so thoroughly answered the question.

42:28.880 --> 42:33.520
Well, hold on, because there's a second answer on here that's a little bit more constructive.

42:34.080 --> 42:34.720
Okay, good.

42:34.720 --> 42:42.960
Answer two says, some off the top of my head that are out there, Las Vegas, Star Wars,

42:44.640 --> 42:50.720
Candy Land, Winter Wonderland, superheroes, Mickey and Minnie Mouse.

42:52.240 --> 42:54.400
I thought about that and how creepy it would be.

42:54.400 --> 42:55.680
Okay, I'm going to throw out this.

42:55.680 --> 43:01.200
If your wedding has fucking mandatory face paint, you have fucked up somewhere down the line.

43:01.200 --> 43:06.240
Imagine you get that invitation, you get that invitation, and then you're looking at it going,

43:06.880 --> 43:08.000
okay, wait, I'm confused.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.600
Why is this invitation shaped like Mickey Mouse's head?

43:11.600 --> 43:14.160
So you call your friend and you're like, I got the invitation.

43:15.040 --> 43:16.560
Is this for your kid's birthday party?

43:16.560 --> 43:17.200
What's going on?

43:17.200 --> 43:18.720
And they're like, no, it's for my wedding.

43:18.720 --> 43:20.880
It's Mickey and Minnie Mouse themed.

43:20.880 --> 43:21.600
Didn't you hear?

43:21.600 --> 43:23.920
I'm a fucking crazy person now.

43:23.920 --> 43:25.280
I got hit by that bus.

43:25.280 --> 43:27.840
I got hit by that bus last month, and now I'm fucking insane.

43:27.840 --> 43:30.960
Do you ever see that Jeff Bridges movie Fearless?

43:30.960 --> 43:33.520
That's me, except now I'm just really stupid.

43:33.520 --> 43:34.480
Tasteless.

43:34.480 --> 43:35.040
Tasteless.

43:36.080 --> 43:39.840
Do you think the douche chills would be so bad that they would travel through time

43:39.840 --> 43:42.480
and make you vomit as soon as you saw the invitation?

43:42.480 --> 43:45.200
Yeah, a winter wonderland of douche chills.

43:46.160 --> 43:47.200
I am freezing.

43:47.840 --> 43:53.520
The Flintstones, Disney princess theme, rock and roll theme, Hollywood glamour.

43:53.520 --> 43:57.440
See, this is what happens when we allow 12 year olds to get married.

43:57.440 --> 44:01.280
Yeah, people push for that age to be reduced, and then this is where we end up.

44:01.840 --> 44:03.280
Hollywood glamour.

44:03.920 --> 44:05.200
Night before Christmas.

44:06.080 --> 44:06.400
What?

44:06.960 --> 44:07.280
What?

44:07.920 --> 44:09.360
This is wedding time.

44:09.360 --> 44:10.640
This is wedding time.

44:12.080 --> 44:13.040
Excuse me?

44:14.480 --> 44:16.240
The night before Christmas?

44:16.880 --> 44:18.160
Who officiated your wedding?

44:18.160 --> 44:19.920
Oh, I believe it was Oogie Boogie.

44:19.920 --> 44:21.440
It was the worst wedding ever.

44:22.800 --> 44:25.120
I told you we should have gone wrestling theme.

44:25.120 --> 44:27.920
We went with a Beethoven themed wedding.

44:27.920 --> 44:29.520
Oh, like all Beethoven music?

44:29.520 --> 44:30.400
No, like the dog.

44:30.400 --> 44:31.440
It was like the dog.

44:31.440 --> 44:33.200
He had a ring tied to him.

44:33.200 --> 44:34.560
It was great.

44:34.560 --> 44:37.600
But then I got into shenanigans and flipped over some chairs.

44:39.120 --> 44:40.160
I went to Charlie's wedding.

44:40.160 --> 44:41.120
You know what he did?

44:41.120 --> 44:41.600
Thor.

44:41.600 --> 44:42.560
Thor themed wedding.

44:42.560 --> 44:43.760
It was so fucking awesome.

44:44.400 --> 44:45.200
Loki was there.

44:45.920 --> 44:49.520
Everyone saw it in 2D and 3D and screen near you.

44:49.520 --> 44:50.160
Super romantic.

44:50.160 --> 44:51.280
You got to choose.

44:51.280 --> 44:55.200
There's a bride side, groom side, 2D side and 3D side.

44:55.200 --> 44:56.320
Fucking sick wedding.

44:56.320 --> 44:58.400
Four Siders Arena Theater.

44:58.400 --> 45:02.640
Hey, wouldn't that be the best priest though if he stood up,

45:02.640 --> 45:05.680
saw him in their Fred and Wilma costumes and then just said,

45:05.680 --> 45:07.200
Dearly beloved.

45:07.200 --> 45:07.600
Nope.

45:11.200 --> 45:13.040
Yabba dabba divorced.

45:13.040 --> 45:17.200
I'm just going to throw out anyone who ever argues that

45:17.200 --> 45:22.000
that legalizing gay marriage takes something away from the

45:22.000 --> 45:25.680
sanctity of marriage to justify that point.

45:25.680 --> 45:28.800
You're going to have to hunt down this question asker and

45:28.800 --> 45:31.920
kill them with your bare hands.

45:31.920 --> 45:32.880
With your bare hands.

45:32.880 --> 45:35.200
And there has to be a picture of it in the front page of the

45:35.200 --> 45:35.840
newspaper.

45:36.720 --> 45:38.960
Sanctity of marriage confirmed.

45:38.960 --> 45:39.680
Wedding safe again.

45:39.680 --> 45:41.600
Flintstone wedding burned to ground.

45:42.320 --> 45:46.000
I want to hear Griffin's last question, but real quick.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.880
We've already told you how you can ask us a question, so we

45:48.880 --> 45:50.080
won't go into that again.

45:50.080 --> 45:53.360
But we will tell you that mbnbam.com is our website.

45:53.360 --> 45:55.680
Got all kinds of interactive interactive elements.

45:55.680 --> 45:57.200
You guys like flash games.

45:57.200 --> 45:58.480
We don't have any of those.

45:58.480 --> 45:59.760
We don't have any flash games.

45:59.760 --> 46:00.320
Sudoku.

46:00.880 --> 46:02.080
You like word search?

46:02.080 --> 46:04.000
Don't don't have those.

46:04.000 --> 46:04.720
Don't have those.

46:04.720 --> 46:09.920
Do have pictures and a lot of Aqua Aqua and yellow.

46:09.920 --> 46:10.800
There's a lot of those.

46:11.520 --> 46:13.600
So if you want those things, we have got you.

46:13.600 --> 46:17.200
So we have some pretty rocking forums.

46:17.200 --> 46:17.760
Yeah.

46:17.760 --> 46:18.480
Oh, that's good.

46:18.480 --> 46:20.000
Check out the community.

46:20.000 --> 46:20.480
That's there.

46:21.440 --> 46:26.960
We are getting close to having our next live show all sort of

46:27.760 --> 46:28.560
straightened out.

46:28.560 --> 46:30.480
It's sort of in the final acts.

46:31.360 --> 46:33.200
Hopefully we'll be able to tell you that next week.

46:34.400 --> 46:35.280
That is our plan.

46:35.280 --> 46:36.320
Tell me where it is, though, right?

46:37.040 --> 46:39.280
Yeah, we are planning on having it tentatively.

46:39.280 --> 46:41.760
We're going to be doing a show in Travis's hometown of

46:41.760 --> 46:42.400
Cincinnati.

46:42.400 --> 46:45.360
It's probably mid-Jun ish.

46:47.040 --> 46:50.400
So that's the plan right now.

46:50.400 --> 46:51.760
Kind of clear your calendars.

46:51.760 --> 46:54.960
We're thinking about like June 12th, right?

46:54.960 --> 46:56.640
Is that the tentative date?

46:57.440 --> 46:59.760
Tentative tentatively guys.

46:59.760 --> 47:01.360
We're trying to get it all worked out for you.

47:01.360 --> 47:04.640
We're holding on to this idea with both hands.

47:04.640 --> 47:06.080
Don't stop believing.

47:06.080 --> 47:08.160
It's not actually as hard as we're making out to be.

47:08.160 --> 47:09.040
We just haven't done it.

47:09.040 --> 47:12.640
So it is going to be a Flintstones theme podcast live

47:12.640 --> 47:12.880
show.

47:14.160 --> 47:14.800
You're going to love it.

47:14.800 --> 47:15.520
It's good for you.

47:15.520 --> 47:16.560
Good for the kids.

47:16.560 --> 47:19.520
And if you know somebody, maybe like a podcast or musician,

47:19.520 --> 47:23.600
a stand-up comedian in the area who'd like to open up for our

47:23.600 --> 47:25.120
show, get in contact.

47:25.120 --> 47:25.680
Reach out.

47:27.840 --> 47:32.400
But we'll have hopefully details on that for you next week.

47:32.400 --> 47:33.760
It's going to be bomb, though.

47:33.760 --> 47:34.480
It's going to be awesome.

47:35.120 --> 47:38.160
And I think that's it.

47:38.160 --> 47:39.440
Do we have anything else going on?

47:39.440 --> 47:40.320
Anything else cracking?

47:41.040 --> 47:45.040
If you haven't yet, take a moment and go check out Jordan

47:45.040 --> 47:49.040
Jesse Go and stop podcasting yourself and Judge John Hodgman

47:49.040 --> 47:51.440
and all those other wonderful Max Fun podcast.

47:51.440 --> 47:52.880
Did we win the friendship war?

47:53.600 --> 47:54.400
We don't know.

47:54.400 --> 47:56.480
I don't think we don't know, but I'm pretty sure.

47:57.040 --> 47:58.720
Pretty sure we trounced them.

47:58.720 --> 47:59.840
It felt like we won.

48:00.400 --> 48:04.480
We got a little Twitter hashtag war with our friends over at

48:04.480 --> 48:05.120
Jordan Jesse Go.

48:05.680 --> 48:06.560
A tiff.

48:06.560 --> 48:07.440
A tiff, I think.

48:07.440 --> 48:08.400
A spat.

48:08.400 --> 48:09.680
I'm pretty sure we destroyed them.

48:10.400 --> 48:16.080
We do love seeing those people quoting our show and talking

48:16.080 --> 48:16.720
about the show.

48:18.080 --> 48:19.840
Wendy Batty, Joey Weiser.

48:19.840 --> 48:21.920
They were all up in it this week.

48:23.040 --> 48:23.680
We got to thank-

48:24.480 --> 48:27.760
Did you guys see Willie Pond's sweet ass Peabody's nasty gum

48:27.760 --> 48:28.320
hat?

48:28.320 --> 48:28.720
Yes.

48:28.720 --> 48:29.680
Yes, that was sweet.

48:30.400 --> 48:31.360
Jen's Valor.

48:31.360 --> 48:35.280
We have to say Jen's Eric Valor.

48:35.280 --> 48:39.600
We have to say thank you to randomly promoting our show to

48:39.600 --> 48:40.480
Julie Benz.

48:42.480 --> 48:43.600
Didn't seem to catch.

48:43.600 --> 48:44.800
Maybe next time.

48:44.800 --> 48:45.600
Maybe next time.

48:45.600 --> 48:47.520
Just keep throwing at her and see what sticks.

48:48.240 --> 48:50.320
Can I throw out a personal message real quick?

48:50.320 --> 48:50.640
Yes.

48:50.640 --> 48:51.360
Of course.

48:51.360 --> 48:53.760
I just want to say happy birthday to my wonderful girlfriend,

48:53.760 --> 48:54.240
Teresa.

48:56.240 --> 48:57.680
And hey, happy Mother's Day to your mom.

48:57.680 --> 49:03.120
If your mom is still around, go give her a hug on the neck and

49:03.120 --> 49:04.160
a peck on the cheek.

49:04.160 --> 49:08.480
They say thanks, moms, for the love and support.

49:10.320 --> 49:11.920
And I think that's it.

49:11.920 --> 49:13.040
I think we're done.

49:13.040 --> 49:13.440
All right.

49:14.080 --> 49:16.400
This final question was sent in by Scatter Heart.

49:17.120 --> 49:18.080
Thank you, Scatter Heart.

49:18.080 --> 49:22.400
It's by Yahoo Answers user Down to Earth who says,

49:24.000 --> 49:26.640
where can I find an adult race car bed?

49:31.440 --> 49:32.560
Justin McElroy.

49:32.560 --> 49:33.680
I'm Travis McElroy.

49:33.680 --> 49:35.040
I'm Griffin McElroy.

49:35.040 --> 49:36.560
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

49:36.560 --> 49:37.280
Kiss your dad.

49:37.280 --> 50:06.560
Let's go around the Earth.
