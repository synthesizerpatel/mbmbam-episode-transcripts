00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.120
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.120 --> 00:48.320
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

00:48.320 --> 00:52.640
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. No wait.

00:52.640 --> 00:53.600
No wait, hold on.

00:53.600 --> 00:54.400
Hold up.

00:54.400 --> 00:58.880
I am your middle-est and now current oldest brother on the show.

00:58.880 --> 01:02.960
Oh shit. Justin is... Do you want to say your name?

01:04.160 --> 01:05.280
Oh, I'm Travis McElroy.

01:05.280 --> 01:11.200
Thank you. Justin's actually moving this week into a new house in beautiful Huntington,

01:11.200 --> 01:12.160
West Virginia.

01:12.160 --> 01:13.760
Into a new palatial estate?

01:14.320 --> 01:19.200
It is. Joking aside, it's a massive place that he bought entirely with your Max Fund Drive

01:19.200 --> 01:20.880
donations. Thanks, suckers.

01:22.880 --> 01:26.960
What you didn't know was Justin was going to use that money to buy a house. Gotcha.

01:26.960 --> 01:32.320
A house is really the ultimate sort of production equipment you can have, isn't it?

01:32.320 --> 01:33.280
Because it's like where all your...

01:33.280 --> 01:35.040
He's put up a lot of baffling.

01:35.040 --> 01:40.400
Yeah, it's where all your shit is. That house is 100% baffling. So yeah, Justin won't be

01:40.400 --> 01:47.520
able to record this week because internet in Huntington is already pretty shoddy and

01:47.520 --> 01:54.240
when relocation is involved, it's just not a possibility. So we got a best-of episode

01:54.240 --> 01:57.840
for you this week. What do we call them? Bros better, bros best?

01:57.840 --> 02:00.400
Bros better, bros better, bros best. I think.

02:00.400 --> 02:04.560
I don't think there's a third one in there. I think I suggested that as a goof for the

02:04.560 --> 02:10.000
first one and I can't fucking believe it's still something we do whenever we run out

02:10.000 --> 02:11.120
of material.

02:11.120 --> 02:11.600
But it is.

02:11.600 --> 02:17.040
So yeah, apologies for not having a new episode. I know it's kind of lame right after the Max

02:17.040 --> 02:23.600
Fund Drive, but Justin's got to move and we're actually under kind of a tight timetable anyway

02:23.600 --> 02:29.760
because we are leaving here in just a few days to begin our first mini tour.

02:30.880 --> 02:32.720
We're very excited about it.

02:32.720 --> 02:38.720
Super psyched. Not our last mini tour. Maybe one day we'll do a mid-sized tour. Maybe we

02:38.720 --> 02:39.840
can get up the gumption.

02:39.840 --> 02:41.440
And then we'll do a fun-sized tour.

02:42.080 --> 02:47.040
And then we'll do one show every other day for like a month.

02:47.040 --> 02:49.200
That'll be our king-sized tour.

02:49.200 --> 02:55.760
Right, exactly. Yeah, we're going to Minneapolis, Milwaukee, and Chicago this week. We're very,

02:55.760 --> 02:56.560
very excited.

02:56.560 --> 03:03.680
If you're going to those shows, make sure to send us questions to nbmbam at maximumfund.org.

03:04.720 --> 03:07.440
And make sure to put the city you'll be at in the subject line.

03:07.440 --> 03:11.440
Yes, absolutely. We want to hear from you. If you've never been to a show before, we

03:11.440 --> 03:16.000
do have some audience questions that we do. It's a lot of fun.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.440
We're really looking forward to seeing everybody in the Midwest.

03:20.720 --> 03:23.280
If you're in the rest of the country, don't get too comfortable.

03:23.280 --> 03:24.880
We're coming at you, coming for you.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.880
Thanks again to everybody who donated to the Max Fund Drive.

03:28.880 --> 03:34.880
It was by far, it's almost ridiculous to say our most successful Max Fund Drive ever.

03:34.880 --> 03:35.520
Oh my god, yes.

03:35.520 --> 03:40.480
I think it was all of the Max Fund Drive donors put together since we joined the network.

03:40.480 --> 03:41.600
It was ridiculous.

03:41.600 --> 03:42.160
It's insane.

03:42.720 --> 03:43.440
Thank you all so much.

03:43.440 --> 03:49.040
It's very flattering and humbling to say the least.

03:50.400 --> 03:52.640
So yeah, we got a best of episode for you.

03:52.640 --> 03:54.160
What's the episode range, Travis?

03:54.160 --> 03:55.280
You're the one putting this one together.

03:55.280 --> 03:58.160
This is 62 to 71.

03:59.040 --> 04:00.080
Yes, the golden age.

04:01.760 --> 04:04.720
The golden era of my brother, my brother and me.

04:05.760 --> 04:06.400
Cool.

04:06.400 --> 04:09.200
Travis, you want to talk about your tat before we get going?

04:09.200 --> 04:11.840
Yeah, I got my brother, my brother and me tattoo.

04:11.840 --> 04:12.640
Did you cry?

04:12.640 --> 04:14.000
Did you cry a little bit?

04:14.000 --> 04:15.920
I did not, Griffin.

04:15.920 --> 04:16.880
Thank you very much.

04:16.880 --> 04:20.560
But it did hurt like a mother.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.240
That's tender skin there on your ribs.

04:24.240 --> 04:29.360
Here's what most people don't know about getting a tattoo.

04:29.360 --> 04:30.880
Everyone's like, do tattoos hurt?

04:31.440 --> 04:33.600
They don't at first.

04:33.600 --> 04:37.600
At first you're like, oh, okay, I can kind of get down.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.680
I understand what this feeling is.

04:39.680 --> 04:44.720
And then like two hours later, it's just like your same area

04:44.720 --> 04:48.640
has just been pummeled by a needle for two hours.

04:48.640 --> 04:51.040
A tender, a succulent area.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.200
By the way, Travis, you really should have asked me

04:53.200 --> 04:55.920
about the placement of the tattoo, the location,

04:55.920 --> 04:58.960
because you know I have a claim on those sweet, sweet ribs.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.480
Oh, I know, Griffin, but I made sure

05:00.480 --> 05:02.080
that the meat was not damaged.

05:02.080 --> 05:05.360
How did that, Travis and I actually have a deal

05:05.360 --> 05:08.640
where if we're ever stranded in a life or death situation,

05:08.640 --> 05:11.760
I'm allowed to eat his amazing, delicious ribs.

05:11.760 --> 05:13.440
I have no idea where that spawned from,

05:13.440 --> 05:15.920
but that's been going for a long time.

05:15.920 --> 05:16.880
That's canon.

05:16.880 --> 05:17.600
That's canon.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.600
That's canon, I wanna eat those sweet ribs.

05:19.600 --> 05:20.320
That's true.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.800
Anyway, God, there's only two of us,

05:22.800 --> 05:24.320
and we've only been going for a couple of minutes,

05:24.320 --> 05:26.880
and we've already gone completely wildly off track.

05:26.880 --> 05:28.400
If you wanna see a picture of that tattoo,

05:28.400 --> 05:30.320
I'm gonna post it on our Facebook group.

05:30.320 --> 05:32.960
My brother and me, just search that on Facebook

05:32.960 --> 05:33.680
and you'll find it.

05:33.680 --> 05:34.400
It's really beautiful.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.160
It was designed for me by Diana Nock.

05:36.720 --> 05:38.400
You should go check out her webpage

05:38.400 --> 05:40.560
Intrepid Girlbot and read her comics

05:40.560 --> 05:42.160
and see all of her amazing art.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.880
I also wanted to say thank you to Graham

05:44.880 --> 05:47.600
at the Purple Panther Tattoo in Los Angeles.

05:48.240 --> 05:51.360
He did it for me and it was lovely and wonderful.

05:51.360 --> 05:52.560
I highly recommend the shop.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.200
Was it clean?

05:53.200 --> 05:53.840
Was it a clean shop?

05:53.840 --> 05:56.560
It was so clean, so wonderful, so much fun.

05:56.560 --> 05:58.160
Everyone there was super nice.

05:58.160 --> 06:00.240
That's my main concern is like every time

06:00.240 --> 06:02.240
I see a tattoo shop in movies,

06:02.240 --> 06:05.920
it's always like there's a drug dealer dying somewhere

06:05.920 --> 06:09.600
and there's like knocked over cans of Mountain Dew.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.120
No Mountain Dew on the ground.

06:11.680 --> 06:12.720
It's very clean.

06:12.720 --> 06:13.760
There's a skeleton.

06:13.760 --> 06:14.080
There's like two skeletons.

06:14.080 --> 06:16.080
All the Mountain Dew was upright.

06:16.080 --> 06:18.080
Okay, there's like three or four skeletons.

06:18.640 --> 06:21.200
There were skeletons, but I think they were purely decorative.

06:22.080 --> 06:24.080
I also wanna say thank you to Travis Dixon,

06:24.640 --> 06:26.800
my friend who went with me and filmed it all.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.200
So I'm actually gonna have a video of me getting the tattoo

06:29.200 --> 06:30.480
up on YouTube pretty soon.

06:30.480 --> 06:31.680
Yeah, and what is the tattoo?

06:31.680 --> 06:32.880
You haven't said it yet.

06:32.880 --> 06:36.080
Oh, it's a beautiful-

06:36.080 --> 06:37.840
Are you looking at it right now to check?

06:37.840 --> 06:38.960
You forgot what it was already?

06:38.960 --> 06:40.000
I can't, it's on my ribs.

06:40.000 --> 06:40.800
I can't see it.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.160
It's a, I was trying to think of the word

06:42.160 --> 06:43.680
cause I think the word is like raring,

06:43.680 --> 06:45.520
but when like a horse is like raised up-

06:45.520 --> 06:46.320
Rearing.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.280
Yeah, rearing.

06:47.280 --> 06:50.560
A rearing stallion with a banner middlest across it

06:50.560 --> 06:52.320
and it's glorious and majestic.

06:53.520 --> 06:54.320
So majestic.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.960
Is it like mid dressage?

06:57.520 --> 07:00.000
Yes, and it's also huge.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.080
It's about like seven inches high.

07:02.080 --> 07:03.440
It's- Holy shit.

07:03.440 --> 07:05.200
It's pretty big.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.160
Okay, that we've prattled for long enough.

07:08.160 --> 07:09.120
Thank you all for listening.

07:09.120 --> 07:11.040
Thank you all so much for donating.

07:11.040 --> 07:14.480
We'll be back in a little bit to tell you about

07:14.480 --> 07:16.080
some of our wonderful sponsors.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.880
So we will see on the other side.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.480
So I recently moved into a apartment

07:22.480 --> 07:23.760
with two other wonderful people

07:23.760 --> 07:26.080
and trying to come up with a name to refer to it as.

07:26.080 --> 07:29.600
The ranch, the old place, but nothing has really stuck.

07:29.600 --> 07:32.720
My roommate, my roommate and me are getting desperate.

07:32.720 --> 07:33.120
Help us.

07:33.120 --> 07:33.840
That's from Tom.

07:34.560 --> 07:37.280
I think that the ranch and the old place

07:37.280 --> 07:38.640
and like the commune and stuff.

07:38.640 --> 07:39.520
That's pretty cool.

07:39.520 --> 07:41.040
But let me pitch this.

07:42.560 --> 07:47.360
What about like an old timey Southern plantation name?

07:47.360 --> 07:48.160
Oh wow.

07:48.160 --> 07:50.080
Like if you called it like Bell Rouge.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.240
I love that.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.920
This is my home La Croix.

07:55.920 --> 07:57.840
Can we just name the house a person's name

07:57.840 --> 08:00.080
and then have it sort of be a character in their story?

08:00.800 --> 08:02.800
Like this is Steve the house?

08:02.800 --> 08:03.760
This is Dennis.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.040
This is my house Dennis.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.120
It's very spacious.

08:07.120 --> 08:07.760
I live in here.

08:07.760 --> 08:09.520
And then you pretend like it's like haunted

08:09.520 --> 08:12.320
and you talk to it and like Dennis, it's cold in here.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.200
Wait, is Dennis your butler?

08:15.920 --> 08:18.400
Well, it's more like a house spirit.

08:19.440 --> 08:23.680
Dennis, your spirit has your ectoplasm has given me a chill.

08:23.680 --> 08:25.040
How can you ever move though?

08:25.920 --> 08:27.520
Yeah, you leave Dennis behind.

08:27.520 --> 08:28.320
Gotta burn it down.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.200
Dennis, as with all friendships,

08:31.200 --> 08:32.560
when you have to leave one of your friends,

08:32.560 --> 08:33.360
you must kill them.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.440
If I can't have you know, I can't Dennis.

08:35.440 --> 08:39.200
Can they name it Scott Bakkila?

08:39.200 --> 08:41.200
Can they name the house Scott Bakkila?

08:41.200 --> 08:47.520
This is my house America's treasure Scott Bakkila.

08:47.520 --> 08:48.320
I live in him.

08:50.720 --> 08:51.200
Hold on.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.880
I live inside Scott Bakkila.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.560
Can we take it to the next level?

08:54.560 --> 08:54.880
Okay.

08:54.880 --> 08:59.040
Can the three of you, assuming you're not on a long lease

08:59.760 --> 09:01.520
that you would be penalized for leaving,

09:01.520 --> 09:03.920
can you just go live inside of Scott Bakkila?

09:04.880 --> 09:06.400
Like inner space style?

09:06.400 --> 09:08.960
Like inner space style, live in his guts.

09:09.840 --> 09:13.040
Are you saying they need to invent shrinking technology?

09:13.040 --> 09:14.240
Shrinking technology.

09:14.240 --> 09:15.040
Where do you live?

09:15.040 --> 09:16.880
Just send that letter straight to Scott.

09:17.760 --> 09:19.200
Just P.O. Box Scott.

09:20.800 --> 09:23.040
I've attached some notes and stuff to his eyeballs

09:23.040 --> 09:25.200
so I can read it too.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.400
Don't read my mail Scott.

09:29.680 --> 09:30.160
That's weird.

09:30.160 --> 09:32.000
All these letters just keep getting mailed to me

09:32.000 --> 09:33.920
but it just says Scott on it.

09:33.920 --> 09:34.640
Oh, that's mine.

09:35.440 --> 09:36.240
Just eat the letter.

09:36.240 --> 09:36.640
I'll get it.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.800
If I could control Scott Bakkila's body from the inside

09:44.800 --> 09:47.680
starting inner space, quantum leap to day one.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.160
You guys don't even know.

09:50.160 --> 09:50.880
Leaped again.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.240
Leaped again.

09:52.240 --> 09:52.800
Here I go.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.080
Oh boy, here I go again.

09:57.120 --> 09:59.760
Tiny people in my body making me make this poor decision.

10:04.080 --> 10:08.960
Scott Bakkila's manager would get a call

10:09.680 --> 10:12.240
and he said, hi, is this a manager?

10:12.240 --> 10:12.740
Yes.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.640
This is definitely Scott Bakkila.

10:16.640 --> 10:19.120
These are definitely aren't people inside of Scott Bakkila.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.520
So wait, wait, wait.

10:21.520 --> 10:23.440
This is gone from living in Scott Bakkila

10:23.440 --> 10:26.000
to controlling it like Meet Dave style.

10:26.000 --> 10:26.500
Yeah.

10:26.500 --> 10:29.360
Like you're inside Scott Bakkila's head piloting him.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.160
That's what we're at Travis, keep up.

10:30.160 --> 10:30.660
Exactly.

10:31.280 --> 10:33.280
That's exactly the situation.

10:34.240 --> 10:36.000
Can you put me on a TV show?

10:36.000 --> 10:36.500
What kind?

10:37.600 --> 10:38.640
Quantum Leap is pretty good.

10:40.400 --> 10:43.120
You know how we've been itching to start on Quantum Leap

10:43.120 --> 10:45.200
to the sequel?

10:45.200 --> 10:47.680
To the sequel to a TV show?

10:50.240 --> 10:52.800
That thing that, of course, people do all the time.

10:52.800 --> 10:56.400
If they're bringing back Dallas, can't they bring back-

10:56.400 --> 10:57.520
I mean, they're bringing back-

10:57.520 --> 11:00.160
I'm willing to bet they wouldn't call it Quantum Leap 2.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.000
I think they could just call it Quantum Leap.

11:02.720 --> 11:04.480
Quantum Leap colon some more.

11:05.040 --> 11:08.400
As everyone knows, he took a brief sabbatical

11:08.400 --> 11:09.360
and never returned home.

11:09.360 --> 11:10.640
He's still out there leaping.

11:10.640 --> 11:11.520
He is.

11:11.520 --> 11:13.120
That show had a very ambiguous ending.

11:13.120 --> 11:16.080
I'm saying it's up to us to shrink ourselves lip and Scott Bakkila's body

11:16.080 --> 11:18.960
and control him to create Quantum Leap 2.

11:18.960 --> 11:19.600
Still leaping.

11:19.600 --> 11:20.100
Yep.

11:21.360 --> 11:21.920
Leaped again.

11:22.720 --> 11:24.880
How much money?

11:24.880 --> 11:26.960
How much dollar do you want me to push for, Scott?

11:26.960 --> 11:30.320
Just the regular amount.

11:30.320 --> 11:33.120
However much I normally get from shows.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.400
Can we three times that money?

11:34.400 --> 11:36.720
Can we triple it and then split it with your-

11:36.720 --> 11:37.760
And then shrink it.

11:37.760 --> 11:39.600
I got a lot of Minnie Mouse to feed.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.120
I have Minnie Mouse to feed.

11:41.120 --> 11:44.640
I mean, by which I mean tiny mouths that live inside me.

11:44.640 --> 11:48.000
Can we make Scott Bakkila giant so that-

11:48.000 --> 11:49.840
Okay, seriously, not shrink down.

11:49.840 --> 11:52.160
We just blow up Scott Bakkila.

11:52.160 --> 11:54.480
Oh my God, you guys have just set up a reality

11:54.480 --> 11:58.080
where we can have a battle between giant Scott Bakkila

11:58.080 --> 11:59.840
and giant Gawdaria.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.560
Waging a war.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.760
Laser shooting out of his eyes.

12:07.760 --> 12:08.400
He's leaping.

12:08.400 --> 12:11.200
Although I don't know why he would have laser technology.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.960
He's just big Scott Bakkila.

12:13.680 --> 12:15.520
Well, you know.

12:15.520 --> 12:15.840
Bigger.

12:15.840 --> 12:16.320
Why not?

12:16.320 --> 12:18.720
I mean, if you're gonna shoot for the stars, shoot for the stars.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.160
Don't limit yourself here.

12:22.160 --> 12:23.120
We gotta dream big.

12:23.840 --> 12:27.200
So we're all gonna go to Scott Bakkila, get inside him at once,

12:27.200 --> 12:31.840
and what if we just gave Scott Bakkila the antibodies to fight Gawdaria

12:31.840 --> 12:34.480
and then you would live inside him and be cured?

12:35.360 --> 12:35.760
Oh, okay.

12:35.760 --> 12:36.960
So he's like an incubator.

12:36.960 --> 12:38.880
He's like a water slide, is what you're saying.

12:40.240 --> 12:44.000
Like every person on Earth would have to go through Scott Bakkila's body

12:44.000 --> 12:45.840
and then they would be free of diseases?

12:45.840 --> 12:47.360
I don't understand what you're saying.

12:47.360 --> 12:51.280
Yeah, Scott Bakkila needs to eat everybody, is what I'm telling you.

12:51.280 --> 12:52.880
Giant Scott Bakkila, not regular Scott Bakkila.

12:52.880 --> 12:55.680
So to answer your question about what to name your apartment,

12:55.680 --> 12:58.080
Scott Bakkila should eat everybody in the world.

12:59.760 --> 13:01.920
Glad that we could help with that one.

13:01.920 --> 13:04.160
No, giant Scott Bakkila should eat everybody in the world.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.480
Sorry, I meant to say giant Scott Bakkila.

13:06.480 --> 13:10.000
If regular Scott Bakkila eats people, he's Hamillector.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.680
Oh, and so then he absorbs all the Gawdaria

13:13.680 --> 13:15.840
and then flies into space and explodes,

13:15.840 --> 13:18.320
saving everyone on Earth but sacrificing himself.

13:18.320 --> 13:20.640
This rain is really weird.

13:20.640 --> 13:25.440
It smells like Scott Bakkila and Gawdaria in rain form.

13:26.160 --> 13:27.440
Why did we come out today?

13:30.800 --> 13:32.880
I share Travis's Netflix account.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.800
I have it hooked up to my PS3

13:34.800 --> 13:36.800
so I can use his account to watch movies,

13:36.800 --> 13:38.400
and the recommendations that pop up

13:38.400 --> 13:41.200
are probably my favorite thing on the planet.

13:41.200 --> 13:44.240
Here's more movies like Earth Girls Are Easy.

13:44.800 --> 13:45.360
Thanks, dude.

13:46.560 --> 13:47.840
Thanks, Netflix.

13:47.840 --> 13:50.960
To be fair, the funny thing is I love really terrible 80s movies

13:50.960 --> 13:52.720
and Griffin loves horror movies,

13:52.720 --> 13:54.880
so the recommendations that they come up with

13:54.880 --> 13:57.280
is some of the most twisted shit I've ever seen.

13:57.280 --> 13:58.400
It usually just gives up.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.480
It's like, fuck it, you get Kangaroo Jack.

14:00.480 --> 14:00.880
Watch it.

14:02.480 --> 14:03.680
I hate you guys.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.040
You broke my computer brain.

14:06.480 --> 14:08.080
I love those recommendations, though,

14:08.080 --> 14:09.040
because it's like,

14:09.040 --> 14:11.040
here's some movies like Earth Girls Are Easy.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.080
Cocoon.

14:12.080 --> 14:15.200
Well, I'm not actually sure that that's...

14:15.200 --> 14:17.200
2001 is Space Odyssey.

14:17.200 --> 14:19.280
Netflix, just because it has space in it,

14:19.280 --> 14:19.760
that's not...

14:20.960 --> 14:22.320
There's two different things.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.680
And also, to be fair, real quick,

14:23.680 --> 14:25.040
while we're talking to Netflix,

14:25.040 --> 14:27.440
I've noticed Netflix that sometimes they'll say shit like,

14:28.000 --> 14:30.320
recommendations, if you liked Earth Girls Are Easy,

14:30.320 --> 14:32.320
check out Earth Girls Are Easy.

14:32.320 --> 14:34.240
That's some weak-ass shit, Netflix.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.160
Netflix, are you sure that I'll like that?

14:36.160 --> 14:37.120
Oh, that reminds me.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.640
Have you seen Earth Girls Are Easy?

14:38.640 --> 14:39.520
I have, Netflix.

14:39.520 --> 14:40.320
You know I have.

14:42.880 --> 14:44.560
Netflix, I watched it on you.

14:45.520 --> 14:46.720
I used you to watch it.

14:47.600 --> 14:48.480
You know that.

14:48.480 --> 14:49.360
You know this truth.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.640
Can we go see Earth Girls Are Easy?

14:52.640 --> 14:56.560
We can't, because we just did seconds ago.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.160
I got a theatrical cut.

14:58.160 --> 14:59.360
That's the same one.

14:59.360 --> 15:00.960
I watched that one with you.

15:00.960 --> 15:01.600
You loved it.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.960
This one has even more Jeff Goldblum sex scenes.

15:04.960 --> 15:05.920
And he's furry in them.

15:06.480 --> 15:07.600
I don't know how much you like that.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.960
Oh, you like furry Jeff Goldblum sex movies?

15:10.960 --> 15:12.080
Here's Earth Girls Are Easy.

15:15.520 --> 15:16.000
Perfect.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.320
Hey, have you seen Das Boot?

15:18.320 --> 15:19.360
Let me start it up.

15:19.360 --> 15:20.080
What the fuck?

15:20.080 --> 15:21.680
This is Earth Girls Are Easy again.

15:22.320 --> 15:23.680
You just changed the picture.

15:24.720 --> 15:26.000
You changed the fuck line.

15:26.880 --> 15:28.240
Actually, now that I've examined it here,

15:28.240 --> 15:31.520
I can see where you've just hastily scribbled Das Boot in crayon.

15:31.520 --> 15:34.000
I mean, the Earth Girls Are Easy box.

15:35.280 --> 15:37.600
Just darkened everything so it looks like it's in a submarine.

15:38.240 --> 15:40.240
I was trying to watch the pianist,

15:40.240 --> 15:43.840
but I see that you went ahead and you just loaded up Earth Girls Are Easy.

15:43.840 --> 15:49.200
By the way, if someone makes an Earth Girls Are Easy sequel in a submarine,

15:49.200 --> 15:52.560
like Earth Girls Are Easy and oh my god, there's so much water.

15:55.040 --> 15:57.600
Earth Girls Are Easy and deeply submerged.

15:57.600 --> 15:58.720
Like, I would watch that.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.320
I would watch that movie, I think.

16:00.320 --> 16:04.880
Like, who would be, okay, who would be the aliens?

16:04.880 --> 16:08.800
Like, before it was Damon Wayans, Jeff Goldblum, and Jim Carrey.

16:08.800 --> 16:10.000
Who would be like-

16:10.000 --> 16:10.880
Oh, Christ.

16:10.880 --> 16:12.160
That's such a power pack.

16:12.160 --> 16:13.040
That's like the-

16:13.040 --> 16:14.480
I mean, you gotta assume-

16:14.480 --> 16:16.320
That's like the new Hollywood rap pack, right?

16:16.320 --> 16:19.920
You gotta assume Dax Shepard weasels his way in there, right?

16:21.520 --> 16:23.600
Gotta get two scoops of Dax.

16:23.600 --> 16:24.880
Gotta get Dax up in there.

16:25.440 --> 16:27.120
See, I think Jonah Hill's too big now.

16:27.120 --> 16:30.240
Jonah, oh, he wouldn't fit in the submarine.

16:30.240 --> 16:30.740
Idiot.

16:33.200 --> 16:33.700
Asshole.

16:35.440 --> 16:40.160
I think Dax Shepard, I think that DL Hughley could use a job.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.080
I need one more.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.480
And Jim Carrey.

16:48.480 --> 16:49.520
And Jim Carrey.

16:50.800 --> 16:55.040
This summer, Jim Carrey, Dax Shepard, and DL Hughley

16:55.040 --> 16:59.440
learn that Earth girls are easy, and also underwater pretty deeply.

17:00.240 --> 17:05.280
They learn how to steer submarines, and also how to please a woman.

17:06.240 --> 17:07.840
Wearing a backup diaper.

17:07.840 --> 17:09.760
Because who's that driving the submarine?

17:09.760 --> 17:10.800
It's Carrot Top.

17:11.600 --> 17:12.800
God, this is a good movie.

17:13.840 --> 17:14.880
When is this coming out?

17:15.440 --> 17:16.720
I really do want to see it.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.120
What are you even saying?

17:21.120 --> 17:23.680
Are you saying Little Brother is going through viral puberty?

17:23.680 --> 17:24.480
What are you saying?

17:24.480 --> 17:25.200
What are you saying?

17:26.960 --> 17:27.520
Hey, Mike.

17:27.520 --> 17:30.080
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:30.080 --> 17:31.040
Pass me my juice.

17:31.840 --> 17:33.200
I'm gonna watch some Yu-Gi-Oh.

17:33.200 --> 17:33.760
You down?

17:36.960 --> 17:38.960
You gotta check this Saturday morning lineup.

17:38.960 --> 17:42.640
We got Yu-Gi-Oh, we got Phineas and Ferb, and SpongeBob.

17:42.640 --> 17:43.760
It's fucking sick.

17:43.760 --> 17:44.720
It's fucking killer.

17:47.440 --> 17:50.080
I spilled Capri Sun on my jam jams.

17:50.080 --> 17:50.580
Fuck.

17:50.580 --> 17:52.260
My whole scene is fucked, Mike.

17:55.060 --> 17:57.380
Hey, Mom, throw my jam jams in the dryer.

17:57.380 --> 17:59.300
Got Capri on them again.

17:59.300 --> 18:00.100
Fuck.

18:00.100 --> 18:02.500
This wouldn't be so frustrating if I knew how to jerk it.

18:02.500 --> 18:03.220
Fuck this.

18:03.220 --> 18:03.860
Fuck everything.

18:05.620 --> 18:07.140
I wish I was three again.

18:10.100 --> 18:12.180
Shit was so easy back then.

18:16.180 --> 18:17.380
I like your idea.

18:17.380 --> 18:26.340
I like your idea that banks are lady zoos.

18:27.620 --> 18:28.500
That's what they are.

18:28.500 --> 18:29.700
They're lady zoos.

18:29.700 --> 18:32.100
You go through the drive-through, you get to see a lady.

18:32.740 --> 18:39.060
You pay your deposit, you pay your APR, and you get to see ladies in prison.

18:43.540 --> 18:46.580
Anybody could use an automatic teller machine for anything.

18:46.580 --> 18:47.940
You know why you don't?

18:47.940 --> 18:51.540
It's because you're going to go see a lady in a prison, and you're going to think,

18:51.540 --> 18:52.740
oh, I should ask her out.

18:52.740 --> 18:57.860
You're going to treat yourself to a little midday alternate reality fantasy about this

18:57.860 --> 18:58.180
girl.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.620
But you're just stop it.

18:59.620 --> 19:01.220
Just go use the teller machine.

19:01.780 --> 19:03.380
Why do you want an extra interaction?

19:03.380 --> 19:03.940
I don't get it.

19:05.300 --> 19:05.940
I don't get it.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.860
So I think somewhere in there, we've decided it's not a good idea to ask that.

19:09.860 --> 19:15.780
I think we've decided that anybody in any service industry, you should not court.

19:15.780 --> 19:16.580
Leave them alone.

19:16.580 --> 19:17.140
They're working.

19:17.140 --> 19:18.100
Leave them alone.

19:18.100 --> 19:19.780
Can't you just leave them alone?

19:20.500 --> 19:21.220
I'll tell you what.

19:21.220 --> 19:22.580
Here's the message you're sending.

19:22.580 --> 19:24.340
Let's talk about first impressions for a second.

19:24.340 --> 19:25.220
You order a pizza.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.940
So this person knows two things about you.

19:27.940 --> 19:29.300
One, you pay for it.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.660
And two, you don't cook.

19:33.460 --> 19:36.900
So that's not a good start.

19:36.900 --> 19:38.020
No, it's not a good start.

19:38.020 --> 19:43.300
Plus, plus, plus, you have to decide this so quickly.

19:43.300 --> 19:45.220
You know absolutely nothing about them.

19:45.220 --> 19:46.020
No, nothing about them.

19:46.020 --> 19:47.940
It's like mystery day.

19:47.940 --> 19:51.700
You look at them for five seconds like, I have to make a split second decision.

19:51.700 --> 19:52.260
And you do too.

19:52.820 --> 19:54.100
That's what decides right now.

19:54.100 --> 19:54.980
We're making a connection.

19:54.980 --> 19:56.740
You guys don't believe in love at first sight?

19:56.740 --> 19:57.380
No.

19:57.380 --> 20:01.220
Not when she's driving a shitty rusted out Dodge Dart and holding a pizza box.

20:01.780 --> 20:05.540
Why can't you fall in love with a girl driving like you said?

20:05.540 --> 20:07.540
Chaz, you're throwing a lot of hate.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.460
You're throwing a lot of hate this app.

20:09.460 --> 20:11.460
I'm just saying that you know nothing about her.

20:11.460 --> 20:12.980
She knows nothing about you.

20:12.980 --> 20:13.700
It's too on the spot.

20:13.700 --> 20:20.660
I have built entire marriages out of less information than you like pizza and don't

20:20.660 --> 20:22.100
like driving to get pizza.

20:25.940 --> 20:26.980
You're down with Hawaiian.

20:26.980 --> 20:30.580
That must mean you're mysterious, cultured, and you have a sophisticated ballot.

20:32.260 --> 20:36.500
Can I appreciate the intermingling, the delicate dance of salty and sweet?

20:40.500 --> 20:40.740
Yahoo!

20:40.740 --> 20:49.460
Answer user Bunny asks, do ghosts see you when you are having sex or when you are using

20:49.460 --> 20:50.020
the toilet?

20:51.620 --> 20:56.260
I think my house is haunted and I don't mind, but I was thinking that if it was my dead

20:56.260 --> 21:00.740
granddad or anyone else I know who has died, then it'd be embarrassing if they saw me naked

21:00.740 --> 21:03.140
or doing things with my husband or on the toilet.

21:08.020 --> 21:08.660
Hey, dummy.

21:08.660 --> 21:11.300
Okay, here's the thing.

21:11.860 --> 21:15.620
Let's play into the premise that your house is haunted with your granddad.

21:17.700 --> 21:22.820
Do you think that in the ethereal plane he's really super duper worried about what you're

21:22.820 --> 21:23.700
doing on the toilet?

21:24.980 --> 21:26.580
Yeah, that'd be really weird of your grandpa.

21:26.580 --> 21:28.180
Was your grandpa like a nasty freak?

21:28.740 --> 21:29.700
Is that like something you do?

21:29.700 --> 21:31.300
Like poke his head in ghost head style?

21:31.300 --> 21:32.740
Like what's going on in here?

21:33.300 --> 21:35.300
Sorry, didn't realize.

21:35.300 --> 21:36.260
I won't keep you.

21:36.260 --> 21:40.500
If he was a nasty Gramps in real life, then I have no reason to believe he won't be a

21:40.500 --> 21:42.260
nasty Gramps in the afterlife.

21:43.460 --> 21:46.740
The idea of a ghost is that after they die, they had unfinished business.

21:46.740 --> 21:51.300
If his unfinished business is to peep on you while you're doing it or hitting the toilet,

21:51.300 --> 21:51.620
then-

21:51.620 --> 21:54.900
If his unfinished business is your unfinished business, then-

21:54.900 --> 21:56.980
I can't move on until I watch your deuce.

21:57.860 --> 22:00.020
I can't move on until you make a movement.

22:00.020 --> 22:02.660
I would watch people fuck all the time if I was a ghost, so.

22:03.860 --> 22:05.380
Eat your ghost popcorn.

22:05.380 --> 22:06.500
What is this question?

22:06.500 --> 22:06.900
Is this-

22:07.940 --> 22:09.700
Of course they fucking do.

22:09.700 --> 22:12.820
Like, are ghosts not allowed to watch you fuck?

22:12.820 --> 22:16.100
Like, if you have sex in a room with a ghost in, the ghost is like, oh, gotta go!

22:17.700 --> 22:19.140
This is awkward.

22:19.140 --> 22:20.180
Are they just colorblind?

22:20.180 --> 22:21.620
Like they can't see naked people?

22:22.340 --> 22:23.220
Don't be a child.

22:24.020 --> 22:24.420
This is-

22:24.420 --> 22:25.460
Don't be a child.

22:25.460 --> 22:27.860
Of course ghosts are watching you have sex all the time.

22:27.860 --> 22:31.780
You're not allowed to believe in ghosts and hauntings and also believe that ghosts aren't

22:31.780 --> 22:35.540
gonna watch you fuck and use the bathroom, because of course they do.

22:36.100 --> 22:40.980
The reason the rest of us are out here in fucking same town is because I-

22:40.980 --> 22:42.900
That idea is too creepy.

22:42.900 --> 22:43.460
I can't-

22:43.460 --> 22:46.020
I can't even begin to believe that-

22:46.580 --> 22:49.380
That there are not only ghosts, but they're watching me deuce.

22:49.380 --> 22:50.580
You know why it's creepy?

22:51.380 --> 22:54.980
Almost a trillion people have walked the earth.

22:55.780 --> 22:56.740
Almost one-

22:57.300 --> 22:58.900
Really let that number sink in.

22:58.900 --> 23:02.100
A trill of people have walked the earth?

23:03.540 --> 23:05.780
The space is gotta be-

23:05.780 --> 23:06.660
We are just caught-

23:06.660 --> 23:07.140
Like a flock of ghosts.

23:07.140 --> 23:12.740
So what you're saying is, the chances that when I am shooting a duke, there is a ghost

23:12.740 --> 23:14.260
not only watching me, but occupying the same space that I am.

23:14.260 --> 23:15.380
I'm in you!

23:15.380 --> 23:16.500
Under you!

23:16.500 --> 23:18.260
You are shitting at a ghost.

23:18.260 --> 23:22.740
You are not only having sex with your wife, you're having sex with like three to four ghosts

23:23.380 --> 23:25.700
that are inhabiting the same space as your wife.

23:25.700 --> 23:29.220
We need to deal with this astral infestation.

23:29.220 --> 23:30.020
This is ridiculous.

23:30.020 --> 23:30.500
Really bad.

23:31.300 --> 23:32.740
Many of them have gone to hell.

23:32.740 --> 23:33.460
Oh, okay.

23:33.460 --> 23:35.460
For watching people use the bathroom.

23:36.260 --> 23:37.540
That's the secret about ghosts.

23:38.740 --> 23:44.180
That's the one rule of ghosts is that you get to walk the earth, but if you watch people

23:44.180 --> 23:49.460
have sex or make a BM or if you actually see a penis or a boob, you go to hell instantly.

23:49.460 --> 23:50.260
There is no appeal.

23:50.260 --> 23:56.500
I am suggesting that we can really get rid of these trillion ghosts if we all just walk

23:56.500 --> 23:57.380
around with our dicks out.

23:58.980 --> 23:59.860
Bye ghosts.

23:59.860 --> 24:00.500
What are you doing?

24:00.500 --> 24:04.580
They'll say as I walk down the street with my dick out and I'll just say, ghost busted.

24:04.580 --> 24:05.940
Busted makes me feel good.

24:05.940 --> 24:09.060
Busted makes me feel good, which explains how fully erect I am.

24:10.340 --> 24:11.220
Don't mind me.

24:11.220 --> 24:11.860
What are you doing?

24:11.860 --> 24:12.740
I'm killing ghosts.

24:13.940 --> 24:14.180
Well.

24:14.180 --> 24:15.060
Makes me feel good.

24:16.340 --> 24:17.220
It's finally happened.

24:18.660 --> 24:19.540
Finally happened.

24:19.540 --> 24:21.620
Griffin's chasing ghosts around with his penis.

24:21.620 --> 24:23.700
So did you guys hear Ray Parker Jr.

24:23.700 --> 24:26.100
Got locked up for public exposure.

24:26.100 --> 24:26.660
We got a button.

24:26.660 --> 24:27.460
We got to get him out.

24:27.460 --> 24:28.660
He's the only one who can stop.

24:31.620 --> 24:34.500
There's a joke about me calling my penis slime right here.

24:34.500 --> 24:35.220
Give me a second.

24:36.740 --> 24:38.020
Okay, we'll just take a break.

24:38.020 --> 24:38.260
Okay.

24:41.460 --> 24:44.260
Is there anything really wrong with being a character, though?

24:44.260 --> 24:51.300
Well, if you name any literary character such as anything from eat, pray, love to the goblet

24:51.300 --> 24:51.940
of fire.

24:51.940 --> 24:52.340
Okay.

24:52.340 --> 24:53.140
I will.

24:53.140 --> 24:54.580
I will impersonate.

24:54.580 --> 24:55.380
Mystic pizza.

24:56.020 --> 24:56.740
Mystic pizza.

24:57.860 --> 25:00.020
Oh, there's some spooky pepperoni.

25:00.020 --> 25:00.900
Pass the insight.

25:01.540 --> 25:01.940
Okay.

25:01.940 --> 25:02.260
Okay.

25:03.380 --> 25:04.980
Sisterhood of the traveling pants.

25:05.540 --> 25:06.740
Hey, come back here.

25:06.740 --> 25:11.780
Hey, hey, hey, I'm all skin and undies down there.

25:11.780 --> 25:12.580
Come on back.

25:12.580 --> 25:15.140
I don't know how we can, how she can use this.

25:15.140 --> 25:20.020
She can't just walk around without pants and say, hi, I'm sisterhood of the traveling pants

25:20.020 --> 25:22.420
because then so I got any other.

25:22.420 --> 25:26.980
You got any other characters for me or all mine are empowered female groups.

25:26.980 --> 25:30.020
Divine secrets of the sisterhood, fried tomatoes.

25:30.020 --> 25:30.820
This is all I got.

25:32.180 --> 25:33.700
These are crunchy yet sour.

25:33.700 --> 25:34.900
I just learned about growing up.

25:39.140 --> 25:39.620
Beaches.

25:40.980 --> 25:41.460
What?

25:41.460 --> 25:43.220
Beaches and or moon struck.

25:44.260 --> 25:47.060
Uh, beaches, uh, moon struck.

25:47.060 --> 25:53.140
I have not seen, uh, beaches, uh, uh, women, you find wings.

25:54.980 --> 25:55.540
That's all I know.

25:55.540 --> 25:56.900
You got stomped.

25:56.900 --> 25:57.860
That was not good.

25:57.860 --> 25:58.740
I'm not sure.

25:58.740 --> 26:00.020
Beaches trivia.

26:00.020 --> 26:00.260
Okay.

26:00.260 --> 26:01.540
Was beaches a book though?

26:03.300 --> 26:04.340
I have a literary mind.

26:04.340 --> 26:05.540
I thought you were all into books.

26:05.540 --> 26:06.820
Now you have a stake in them.

26:07.780 --> 26:10.020
Um, it proves to me beaches was a book.

26:10.020 --> 26:15.700
I have to believe that there is a book adaptation of the film beaches, and I have to believe

26:15.700 --> 26:22.580
that I have won all the book prizes that books can win best book based on beaches.

26:24.660 --> 26:31.940
And now the 1997 best book award goes to beaches.

26:31.940 --> 26:34.500
The book of the movie with Bette Midler.

26:34.500 --> 26:38.660
You can only read it once because once you get to the end, your tears have soaked the

26:38.660 --> 26:39.620
book through.

26:39.620 --> 26:40.500
Just throw it away.

26:40.500 --> 26:41.860
Buy a new Beaches book.

26:41.860 --> 26:43.300
Buy two Beaches book.

26:43.300 --> 26:44.260
I need your money.

26:45.060 --> 26:47.620
Mark Twain, come on up here and accept this award.

26:50.660 --> 26:54.020
I'm glad he came out of retirement to write Beaches, the book of the movie with Bette

26:54.020 --> 26:54.500
Midler.

26:58.500 --> 27:01.300
Uh, this Yahoo was sent in by Mike Bernsteil.

27:01.300 --> 27:01.860
Thank you, Mike.

27:01.860 --> 27:03.860
It's a pretty cool name.

27:03.860 --> 27:04.420
Huh?

27:04.420 --> 27:05.380
Pretty cool name.

27:05.380 --> 27:05.940
Yeah.

27:05.940 --> 27:06.500
Yeah.

27:06.500 --> 27:07.060
I like it.

27:07.060 --> 27:09.060
You know what, now that you mention it, it is a pretty cool name.

27:09.060 --> 27:17.700
It's by Yahoo Answers user PDFGhost, who says, what are some good ways to look cool at the

27:17.700 --> 27:18.260
urinal?

27:21.780 --> 27:24.420
I'm trying to seem cool at work when I'm at the urinal.

27:24.420 --> 27:27.620
Lately, while I'm peeing, I've been putting my hands in my pockets.

27:27.620 --> 27:31.780
I've thought about resting my elbow on the wall and putting my head against my hand, just kind of

27:31.780 --> 27:34.340
chilling, acting like it's not even a big deal, and I'm peeing.

27:34.340 --> 27:35.140
NBD.

27:35.140 --> 27:36.500
Any other ideas?

27:37.220 --> 27:39.220
It's not like I'm trying to hook up with any dudes.

27:39.220 --> 27:42.420
I just want people to think, man, that's a chill dude.

27:42.420 --> 27:45.300
And everyone has to go to the bathroom, so that's where you see the widest variety of

27:45.300 --> 27:45.800
people.

27:48.340 --> 27:51.060
Bring your office chair with you and just kind of recline.

27:51.060 --> 27:52.580
Oh, god, yes.

27:52.580 --> 27:54.260
Just roll in there like, what's up?

27:54.260 --> 27:59.140
Chillin', chill dude.

27:59.140 --> 28:04.100
Oh, and go to the tiny kid's urinal, and just lean back in your chair and hit it.

28:04.100 --> 28:04.900
It looks huge.

28:05.540 --> 28:06.900
Can you have a Mai Tai in your hand?

28:06.900 --> 28:10.020
I don't know how cool your office is, but if you can have a Mai Tai in your hand while

28:10.020 --> 28:14.980
you pee from your chair into a child's urinal while your boss watches you.

28:16.420 --> 28:20.340
If you can do it hands-free and put both hands up in a gesture that says, what the fuck,

28:20.340 --> 28:21.860
it's summer, chill dude.

28:22.500 --> 28:23.860
And maybe like hang ten.

28:23.860 --> 28:24.100
Yeah.

28:25.940 --> 28:31.220
If you can do some wall push-ups while you're doing it, like get that, get diesel.

28:31.780 --> 28:32.420
Get pumped.

28:32.420 --> 28:35.220
Is it too complicated to do a touchdown dance?

28:36.820 --> 28:39.460
As you're, like when you're done or what?

28:39.460 --> 28:40.580
Like as you're doing it.

28:41.940 --> 28:46.820
Yeah, I mean, it seems like a premature celebration because you don't know how long it's gonna

28:46.820 --> 28:48.740
go or if you're gonna go that dribble.

28:48.740 --> 28:49.860
What if you do a bad job of it?

28:49.860 --> 28:55.620
Um, can you plank?

28:55.620 --> 28:59.860
Oh, you could if you had those like wall divider things and you just laid across them.

28:59.860 --> 29:02.420
And you tucked your wormy in one of the toilets.

29:03.220 --> 29:04.100
While you aim down.

29:04.100 --> 29:05.940
While you planked on it and you peed straight down.

29:07.300 --> 29:10.340
But if there are other people in that bathroom, I mean, if there are other people at the other

29:10.340 --> 29:12.420
urinals that you're planking on, that's gonna be a scene.

29:12.420 --> 29:14.500
That's gonna be a whole ordeal.

29:15.460 --> 29:17.380
And what if they got one of those big pee troughs?

29:18.020 --> 29:18.900
Oh, wait.

29:18.900 --> 29:20.260
Nothing just laying in the trough.

29:20.260 --> 29:21.060
That would be perfect.

29:21.620 --> 29:25.460
I've seen some people, I've seen some people at a Cubs game that just go to sleep in that

29:25.460 --> 29:26.100
trough.

29:26.100 --> 29:27.140
Daddy, is he planking?

29:27.140 --> 29:28.020
Like, no, son.

29:29.060 --> 29:30.180
No, son, he's half dead.

29:30.980 --> 29:32.180
That's, that's JB.

29:32.180 --> 29:34.020
You gotta pee, pee around him.

29:37.060 --> 29:40.820
Although, although if you would look cool, peeing on another guy is cool.

29:45.140 --> 29:45.860
Who's the boss?

29:46.420 --> 29:46.900
Who's the boss?

29:46.900 --> 29:48.980
Oh, wait, you are the boss of this company.

29:48.980 --> 29:50.740
I'll go clean out my desk.

29:52.180 --> 29:52.980
Sorry about your desk.

29:52.980 --> 29:54.900
Maybe just move your desk into the bathroom.

29:56.340 --> 29:56.740
Yeah.

29:56.740 --> 29:57.860
Don't pee in a urinal.

29:59.060 --> 30:01.380
Take Dominion back over your urination.

30:01.380 --> 30:03.300
Just pee in the middle of a conversation.

30:05.380 --> 30:06.180
Pee in your pants.

30:06.180 --> 30:06.980
I better go watch the show.

30:06.980 --> 30:08.740
Hey, Bradley, can you hold on for just one second?

30:10.020 --> 30:10.660
Okay, go on.

30:10.660 --> 30:14.820
Can you pee in your pants and then put your pants in the urinal while everybody's watching?

30:14.820 --> 30:18.420
And wash them in there like a little washing machine?

30:18.420 --> 30:19.220
I'll get this later.

30:19.220 --> 30:19.940
Or just leave them behind.

30:19.940 --> 30:21.460
Yeah, I'll pick it up at five.

30:21.460 --> 30:23.940
Hey, Jerry, how are things in accounts?

30:25.860 --> 30:27.780
When Bradley Cooper took the Limitless Pill,

30:27.780 --> 30:31.300
do you think he came up with the coolest way to ever use the urinal?

30:31.300 --> 30:33.060
Can you just do what he does in that movie?

30:33.060 --> 30:34.180
So you've seen the movie, right?

30:34.820 --> 30:37.060
Have not seen it, but does he use a urinal at one point?

30:37.060 --> 30:37.460
He uses-

30:37.460 --> 30:38.820
He uses all the urinals.

30:38.820 --> 30:40.660
Uh-huh, all of them at once.

30:41.300 --> 30:43.700
Limitless, Limitless Pill gives you five dicks

30:43.700 --> 30:46.020
that are very accurate for each one.

30:46.020 --> 30:48.980
You know how human beings only use 20% of their dicks?

30:50.980 --> 30:54.500
Bradley Cooper uses 100% of his five dicks.

30:54.500 --> 30:56.820
He does 500% all the time.

30:56.820 --> 30:58.100
That's what Limitless is all about.

30:59.940 --> 31:00.340
I thought I-

31:00.340 --> 31:01.300
Is that what it's about?

31:02.340 --> 31:05.620
To be fair, if that's what it was about, it would have been a way better movie.

31:06.580 --> 31:10.580
Just a ring of dicks and never any ring of dicks around his-

31:10.580 --> 31:12.580
Like a Cthulhu.

31:12.580 --> 31:15.940
Like, it's a very Cthulhu-esque situation.

31:15.940 --> 31:16.340
Uh-huh.

31:18.980 --> 31:20.740
So I guess those are some cool things you can do.

31:20.740 --> 31:21.380
Can you flex?

31:21.940 --> 31:23.460
Can you thumb wrestle the guy next to you?

31:23.460 --> 31:24.740
There's so many options.

31:24.740 --> 31:26.340
Can you thumb wrestle yourself?

31:27.460 --> 31:29.300
You can scream at the top of your lungs.

31:30.020 --> 31:30.900
Scream not again.

31:31.620 --> 31:33.140
Or I finally got it.

31:33.140 --> 31:33.380
Yeah.

31:33.380 --> 31:34.340
I got it.

31:34.340 --> 31:37.300
Can you open up a window and pee out the window?

31:37.300 --> 31:37.780
Just like-

31:37.780 --> 31:39.540
And put your arms up in a manner that says,

31:39.540 --> 31:40.980
I don't fucking care, man.

31:40.980 --> 31:42.020
I think that part's good.

31:42.020 --> 31:44.020
I think that part is non-negotiable.

31:44.020 --> 31:44.580
You gotta put your hands up.

31:44.580 --> 31:46.180
It's gotta be the, like, fuck it.

31:46.180 --> 31:46.340
Yeah.

31:46.340 --> 31:47.460
Just peeing in.

31:47.460 --> 31:51.780
And I do love dropping, like, pants and underwear.

31:51.780 --> 31:52.500
Hey, by the way-

31:52.500 --> 31:53.780
Oh, be a girl.

31:53.780 --> 31:56.260
I think it's a pretty dope way to win at the urinal.

31:56.260 --> 31:58.500
If you're a girl, I think this day is yours.

31:58.500 --> 31:58.740
How-

31:58.740 --> 31:59.860
Hey, Dave, check this out.

31:59.860 --> 32:00.500
High five.

32:00.500 --> 32:00.980
I got it.

32:01.700 --> 32:04.820
You go to the stall and you sit down to pee,

32:04.820 --> 32:06.580
but you leave the stall door open.

32:09.620 --> 32:10.580
Oh, occupy.

32:10.580 --> 32:11.220
Oh.

32:11.220 --> 32:12.180
Oh.

32:12.180 --> 32:12.580
No, don't worry.

32:12.580 --> 32:13.300
What are you looking at?

32:13.300 --> 32:14.260
Hey, we're all dudes.

32:14.260 --> 32:15.860
Hey, all dudes here.

32:15.860 --> 32:18.900
I'm just taking a break, taking a relaxer while I go.

32:19.540 --> 32:20.580
This one's for me.

32:20.580 --> 32:20.980
This one's-

32:21.780 --> 32:23.300
This Tucker's for me.

32:24.020 --> 32:26.420
Does anybody have an O Magazine I can peruse?

32:28.420 --> 32:30.020
Got some good housekeeping in here.

32:30.020 --> 32:31.060
You guys want to read?

32:31.060 --> 32:31.780
Oh, you can't read.

32:31.780 --> 32:33.300
You're standing up, dummies.

32:33.300 --> 32:34.660
You still use urinals?

32:34.660 --> 32:45.220
What a joke.

32:45.220 --> 32:46.740
All right, we're going to end this real quick.

32:46.740 --> 32:48.820
We've got some sponsors for this week's episode,

32:49.540 --> 32:52.260
and it's some of our favorites.

32:52.260 --> 32:52.420
Yeah.

32:53.220 --> 32:57.140
You could even call this a bros better bros best of sponsors.

32:57.140 --> 32:59.140
I think that that would be accurate, Griffin.

32:59.140 --> 33:01.060
I think that that is absolutely correct.

33:01.060 --> 33:04.100
Our first sponsor this week, you know them, you love them.

33:04.100 --> 33:06.180
It might be on your genitals right now.

33:06.180 --> 33:06.900
Me undies.

33:07.780 --> 33:08.980
Tabasco hot sauce.

33:10.740 --> 33:11.620
What are you into?

33:11.620 --> 33:12.900
Daisy sour cream.

33:12.900 --> 33:13.700
What the fuck?

33:13.700 --> 33:14.500
Why did you put that?

33:14.500 --> 33:15.220
What are you doing?

33:16.340 --> 33:17.140
Me undies.

33:17.140 --> 33:19.140
It's you're going to wear underwear.

33:19.140 --> 33:21.700
You're just going to do it unless you're one of those weird people

33:21.700 --> 33:23.380
that's never wearing underwear.

33:23.380 --> 33:24.900
In which case, like we get it.

33:24.900 --> 33:27.140
You're spirited and earthy and stuff,

33:27.140 --> 33:29.780
but put some underwear on because it feels better,

33:29.780 --> 33:33.060
especially when the underwear you've got on is me undies.

33:33.060 --> 33:35.860
And it's going to keep your balls from rubbing against your jeans.

33:35.860 --> 33:37.940
I wore them all day today while I was doing yard work.

33:37.940 --> 33:40.900
I was doing some very hot and heavy hedge trimming.

33:40.900 --> 33:44.900
And I got back inside and my whole body was damp like a sponge cake.

33:44.900 --> 33:47.700
And then I took my me undies off and it was like a mummy down there.

33:47.700 --> 33:48.420
It was so dry.

33:49.700 --> 33:50.260
It was weird.

33:50.260 --> 33:54.260
I was mummy like in one zone and the rest of my area was sponge cake.

33:55.220 --> 33:58.100
When I travel, I only wear me undies for that very

33:58.100 --> 34:00.900
because, you know, you start you sit on a plane for like four hours.

34:00.900 --> 34:03.060
Listen, we're getting into the nitty gritty right now,

34:03.060 --> 34:06.500
but we're going to talk exclusively about genital moisture.

34:06.500 --> 34:11.060
But I'm just saying like it keeps your zone very pleasant on long plane rides,

34:11.060 --> 34:12.180
long car drives.

34:12.180 --> 34:15.140
I'll tell you this, a me undies like pop up store,

34:15.140 --> 34:18.100
you know, opened up in our neighborhood.

34:18.100 --> 34:18.820
Oh my God.

34:18.820 --> 34:21.620
And Teresa and I went down and each bought like three pairs.

34:21.620 --> 34:26.500
So like I'm slowly turning over my whole underwear wardrobe to me undies.

34:26.500 --> 34:27.300
That's a good call.

34:27.300 --> 34:30.180
When I get to the bottom of my me undies in my lineup,

34:30.180 --> 34:31.300
it's time for laundry.

34:31.300 --> 34:33.300
I don't want to do anything but wear me undies.

34:33.300 --> 34:34.180
Here's the thing.

34:34.180 --> 34:37.540
Me undies is dedicated to offering the most comfortable underwear that fit great.

34:37.540 --> 34:40.980
Don't ride up on you and literally pull moisture away.

34:40.980 --> 34:42.580
Literally pull moisture away.

34:42.580 --> 34:44.100
You can hear the sucking.

34:44.100 --> 34:47.620
You can hear the sucking sound and it's I won't lie.

34:47.620 --> 34:48.820
That part's a little bit upsetting.

34:48.820 --> 34:52.100
I wish that they didn't make a loud, like it's hard to talk.

34:52.100 --> 34:53.700
It's hard to have a conversation over them.

34:53.700 --> 34:54.580
Like I can barely hear you.

34:54.580 --> 34:57.540
But after a while, it just kind of like tunes out in the background,

34:57.540 --> 34:59.220
you know, and you won't even notice it anymore.

34:59.220 --> 35:02.340
I sleep to them actually now, the white noise of the sucking sound.

35:02.340 --> 35:03.380
It really helps.

35:03.380 --> 35:04.900
It's environmentally friendly.

35:04.900 --> 35:07.140
The materials they use are sustainably sourced.

35:07.780 --> 35:10.100
And also they look great.

35:10.100 --> 35:10.900
Like that's the thing.

35:10.900 --> 35:13.540
There's tons of different, tons of different patterns.

35:14.260 --> 35:15.700
They're for men and women.

35:15.700 --> 35:19.380
You can get matching pairs if like you and your loved one want to do that.

35:19.380 --> 35:20.980
It's pretty cute, you guys.

35:21.860 --> 35:22.660
Here's what I want you to do.

35:22.660 --> 35:25.940
I want you to go to meundies.com.

35:25.940 --> 35:27.460
No matter what, go to meundies.com

35:27.460 --> 35:29.540
because then you can look at pictures of people wearing underwear.

35:29.540 --> 35:30.340
That's awesome.

35:30.340 --> 35:32.660
But go to meundies.com slash my brother.

35:32.660 --> 35:34.580
Not only will you look at pictures of people in underwear,

35:34.580 --> 35:37.540
you get 20% off your first order and free shipping.

35:37.540 --> 35:38.340
It's amazing.

35:38.340 --> 35:40.500
It's an amazing deal for some amazing underwear.

35:40.500 --> 35:42.340
You have no reason not to do it.

35:42.340 --> 35:43.540
Go get at it.

35:45.300 --> 35:47.300
We also have another sponsor this week.

35:47.300 --> 35:48.180
Can I tell you about them?

35:48.740 --> 35:52.020
Oh, I mean, I already know about it, but sure.

35:52.020 --> 35:55.540
I was more talking to my computer monitor, I guess.

35:55.540 --> 35:59.380
Oh, like the general you, the royal you.

35:59.380 --> 36:00.500
The ghost in the machine.

36:01.380 --> 36:03.060
I want to tell you about Blue Apron.

36:03.060 --> 36:07.060
Blue Apron is a tasty, tasty meal delivery service

36:08.340 --> 36:09.940
that for less than $10 a meal,

36:10.980 --> 36:14.580
they'll get you the fresh ingredients that you need to make these delicious meals.

36:14.580 --> 36:16.420
They are going to be perfectly proportioned

36:16.420 --> 36:19.860
with step-by-step instructions on how to make each recipe.

36:20.580 --> 36:22.660
Well, you're not making the recipe, are you?

36:22.660 --> 36:25.220
You're making the food that the recipe details.

36:25.220 --> 36:26.420
Well, and I'll tell you this,

36:26.420 --> 36:28.660
Theresa and I love Blue Apron.

36:28.660 --> 36:33.220
We pretty much, it's pretty much taking over our dinner schedule.

36:34.340 --> 36:38.900
And I'll say this, man, it says it's for two people,

36:38.900 --> 36:40.740
but you're going to end up with leftovers.

36:40.740 --> 36:41.140
Yum.

36:41.140 --> 36:43.700
And it's going to feed you for another two meals.

36:43.700 --> 36:45.300
It's such a good deal.

36:45.300 --> 36:46.020
Double food.

36:46.020 --> 36:47.380
It's double food.

36:47.380 --> 36:48.260
What do you party on?

36:48.260 --> 36:51.940
Because they got chili blackened cod with epizote.

36:51.940 --> 36:53.860
Fuck, I didn't say that right, probably.

36:53.860 --> 36:55.380
No, I think you nailed it.

36:55.380 --> 36:58.180
Chili blackened cod with epizote.

36:58.180 --> 37:00.180
Grapefruit, avocado, and rice salad.

37:00.180 --> 37:02.100
They got lamb meatball stew.

37:02.100 --> 37:03.460
What's your jam?

37:04.100 --> 37:05.460
Man, I tell you what we just made.

37:06.260 --> 37:09.220
They were these, I'm trying to remember what the meat was.

37:09.220 --> 37:10.500
I want to say it was like bison,

37:10.500 --> 37:13.700
but it was burgers on pretzel buns with this cheddar sauce.

37:14.340 --> 37:15.460
It was insane.

37:16.020 --> 37:16.820
So good.

37:17.460 --> 37:19.380
Like, this is the thing.

37:19.380 --> 37:21.060
Here's the best thing about Blue Apron.

37:21.060 --> 37:23.460
Not only do they send you the stuff, right?

37:23.460 --> 37:25.620
So like, everything's right there to make the meal.

37:26.180 --> 37:29.220
Like, you still get to feel the accomplishment

37:29.220 --> 37:30.500
of making the meal.

37:30.500 --> 37:32.100
They give you step-by-step instructions.

37:32.100 --> 37:32.900
It's so clear.

37:32.900 --> 37:35.300
It's so even if you know nothing about cooking,

37:35.300 --> 37:37.540
they tell you everything you need to do to do it.

37:37.540 --> 37:40.740
And then you're like, I made this awesome meal.

37:40.740 --> 37:42.420
Look what I hath wrought.

37:42.420 --> 37:45.220
And it really gives you this like very empowering feeling.

37:45.220 --> 37:48.820
You can impress, you know, if you're trying to impress a date.

37:48.820 --> 37:50.340
It's a pretty solid.

37:50.340 --> 37:52.660
You feel like a food god.

37:52.660 --> 37:54.100
You can check out this week's menu

37:54.100 --> 37:56.500
and get your first two meals for free,

37:56.500 --> 37:58.260
which is fucking bonkers,

37:58.260 --> 38:01.460
by going to blueapron.com slash my brother.

38:01.460 --> 38:02.740
It's such a good deal, people.

38:02.740 --> 38:03.460
I'm a big fan.

38:04.260 --> 38:06.820
Our sponsors tend to win me over pretty quickly.

38:06.820 --> 38:09.860
And then I'm like, well, I'm just doing this from now on.

38:09.860 --> 38:12.660
Like, Teresa and I pretty much only wear me undies

38:12.660 --> 38:14.420
and eat Blue Apron.

38:14.420 --> 38:15.460
In your undies.

38:15.460 --> 38:16.260
In our undies.

38:16.260 --> 38:18.260
But we can't get it on our undies.

38:18.260 --> 38:18.820
Nope.

38:18.820 --> 38:21.220
It stains.

38:21.220 --> 38:29.220
Our next ad is for 199X at www.agamewithoutmechanics.com.

38:29.220 --> 38:31.700
And then vote for it on Steam Greenlight.

38:31.700 --> 38:34.580
199X is a lightly interactive adventure game

38:34.580 --> 38:37.220
that explores the relationship between the player, you,

38:37.220 --> 38:39.060
and Clara, the person you control.

38:39.060 --> 38:42.100
It is funny, sad, and everything in between.

38:42.100 --> 38:43.300
Catch the fever.

38:43.300 --> 38:44.340
I love that tagline.

38:44.340 --> 38:47.220
It seems so wildly incongruous with the game

38:47.220 --> 38:48.020
that they're presenting.

38:48.020 --> 38:51.300
It's like, catch and collect all of the Claras.

38:51.300 --> 38:53.380
And then trade them with your friends on the playground.

38:53.380 --> 38:54.100
Who can battle?

38:56.020 --> 38:57.780
Who can level up the strongest, Clara?

38:58.820 --> 39:00.260
Quick description for their website.

39:00.260 --> 39:02.420
In 199X, you control Clara.

39:02.420 --> 39:04.500
I think it's 1990X, like a year.

39:04.500 --> 39:05.140
Oh, sure.

39:05.140 --> 39:05.380
OK.

39:06.580 --> 39:07.540
You control Clara.

39:07.540 --> 39:08.500
That's the problem.

39:08.500 --> 39:10.420
The doctors say she's delusional.

39:10.420 --> 39:12.020
But you know that can't be true.

39:12.020 --> 39:13.620
She doesn't seem to believe it either.

39:13.620 --> 39:15.940
The two of you need to work together to find a cure.

39:16.900 --> 39:17.940
That sounds pretty cool.

39:17.940 --> 39:18.900
I'm going to check that out.

39:18.900 --> 39:19.700
And you should too.

39:20.340 --> 39:21.140
We've got another.

39:21.700 --> 39:23.300
Can I control Bulbasaur instead?

39:24.020 --> 39:24.740
Well, you can always control Bulbasaur.

39:24.740 --> 39:26.580
Is that even an option in this video game?

39:26.580 --> 39:27.940
Did they even consider that?

39:27.940 --> 39:29.540
I haven't played through it yet, Griffin.

39:29.540 --> 39:30.340
So I don't know.

39:30.340 --> 39:31.060
But go to www.

39:31.060 --> 39:33.620
Did they even consider Kengis Khan?

39:33.620 --> 39:37.460
Go to www.agamewithoutmechanics.com and check it out.

39:37.460 --> 39:38.180
One last thing.

39:38.180 --> 39:41.220
If you are on the search for a brand new comedy podcast

39:41.220 --> 39:43.940
to suit all of your pop culture cravings,

39:43.940 --> 39:46.580
look no further than Almost Famous.

39:46.580 --> 39:51.140
This is a podcast that is hosted by Hollywood hotshot Alex

39:51.140 --> 39:54.820
Wareheit and esteemed academic Caitlin Sabold

39:54.820 --> 39:58.420
as they discuss pop culture, film, television, celebrities,

39:58.420 --> 40:00.660
actual real life, and everything in between

40:00.660 --> 40:03.940
as they struggle to become Almost Famous.

40:03.940 --> 40:06.580
Alex and Caitlin share outrageous personal anecdotes,

40:06.580 --> 40:08.740
put a fresh spin on pop culture, and even

40:08.740 --> 40:10.580
make some heartfelt social commentary,

40:10.580 --> 40:12.660
all while being uproariously funny.

40:12.660 --> 40:15.540

40:26.580 --> 40:30.580
We feel our life force waning with every unsubscription.

40:30.580 --> 40:32.980
Speaking of Almost Famous, while I was getting my tattoo,

40:32.980 --> 40:36.260
I took a break to walk around and get some blood flowing.

40:36.260 --> 40:38.820
I stepped outside with my friend Travis.

40:38.820 --> 40:40.740
And he was like, hey, look over there.

40:40.740 --> 40:44.020
And it was Sam Rockwell and Joaquin Phoenix just hanging out

40:44.020 --> 40:44.980
at a coffee shop.

40:44.980 --> 40:45.780
Oh, man.

40:45.780 --> 40:47.620
To be a fly on that glass.

40:47.620 --> 40:49.860
Well, it was wonderful because I had my shirt half off,

40:49.860 --> 40:52.340
so the tattoo was still exposed, which also meant

40:52.340 --> 40:53.860
my gut was exposed.

40:53.860 --> 40:56.260
So Sam Rockwell looked over at me at one point,

40:56.260 --> 40:57.940
kind of registered I was there, and went back

40:57.940 --> 40:58.820
to his conversation.

40:58.820 --> 41:00.260
And I was like, oh, great.

41:00.260 --> 41:02.420
So if nothing else, I know Sam Rockwell,

41:02.420 --> 41:03.620
so I'm going to be your gut today.

41:03.620 --> 41:04.100
Yeah.

41:04.100 --> 41:05.700
Joaquin Phoenix unbuttoned his shirt

41:05.700 --> 41:08.180
and showed you his 14 horse tattoos.

41:08.180 --> 41:08.660
Mm-hmm.

41:08.660 --> 41:10.180
And he was like, oh, good luck, man.

41:10.180 --> 41:10.900
Good luck.

41:10.900 --> 41:11.620
Thanks, Joaquin.

41:11.620 --> 41:13.220
And he was like, do you want to be in my next movie?

41:13.220 --> 41:14.660
And I said, Joaquin, I'm flattered.

41:14.660 --> 41:15.940
And he said, it's cool, man.

41:15.940 --> 41:17.940
So Inherent Fights 2, look for it.

41:17.940 --> 41:18.820
Look for it.

41:18.820 --> 41:21.140
Keep walking the line some more.

41:21.780 --> 41:22.740
Run the line.

41:22.740 --> 41:24.660
A line even further.

41:24.660 --> 41:25.620
A line to remember.

41:26.740 --> 41:28.340
That was a lot of things, a lot of jokes

41:28.340 --> 41:29.140
that we're throwing at you.

41:29.140 --> 41:31.940
See, there is some new material in this episode.

41:31.940 --> 41:33.940
Fuck, we're going to have to put this best of episode

41:33.940 --> 41:35.540
in the next best of episode, Trav.

41:35.540 --> 41:38.500
Oh, remember that time when Sam Rockwell saw Trav as his gut?

41:39.220 --> 41:39.940
Classic bit.

41:40.580 --> 41:41.080
Yeah.

41:41.700 --> 41:44.340
Thank you all for listening again and for donating again.

41:44.340 --> 41:46.020
We're just going to keep thanking you for donating

41:46.020 --> 41:48.980
for the next year, probably, until the next Max Fund Drive.

41:48.980 --> 41:49.300
I hope that's OK.

41:49.300 --> 41:50.500
It's all going to bleed together.

41:51.860 --> 41:52.900
Back to the goofs.

41:54.260 --> 41:55.780
Everybody, I want complete silence.

41:55.780 --> 41:56.660
Griffin, you have to read the whole thing.

41:56.660 --> 41:58.180
Let's see how long we can go.

41:58.180 --> 41:58.980
OK.

41:58.980 --> 41:59.480
Oh, man.

42:00.500 --> 42:03.780
This is Baka Otaku 30.

42:04.660 --> 42:05.220
Good start.

42:06.100 --> 42:08.420
Is there some music you can underlay here later

42:08.420 --> 42:09.460
when you're editing together?

42:09.460 --> 42:10.500
Something kind of nice.

42:10.500 --> 42:12.100
Yeah, I'll throw down some Norah Jones.

42:12.100 --> 42:12.600
Yeah.

42:12.600 --> 42:14.440
That would be great, actually.

42:15.960 --> 42:18.280
Having been to my fair share of spanking parties,

42:18.280 --> 42:19.240
I'll happily answer this.

42:19.880 --> 42:21.720
Though more information can be found in an essay

42:21.720 --> 42:23.480
that I posted on my spanking blog months ago.

42:24.120 --> 42:25.800
The link to my blog can be found on my profile,

42:25.800 --> 42:28.040
though it'll take some digging to find the correct entry.

42:28.040 --> 42:31.400
Unless a party has a specific theme like teacher-student,

42:31.400 --> 42:33.720
most people will simply wear clothes that are comfortable

42:33.720 --> 42:34.440
and casual.

42:34.440 --> 42:37.400
Spankers may tend to wear clothes that are more formal

42:37.400 --> 42:38.440
or authoritative.

42:38.440 --> 42:55.320
And spankies lean towards clothes that are loose fitting

42:55.320 --> 42:56.040
or easily removed,

42:56.040 --> 42:58.520
allowing faster access to bare their bottom.

43:01.080 --> 43:03.720
Skirts are common among female spankies,

43:03.720 --> 43:06.200
with pleated schoolgirl skirts being the most common.

43:06.200 --> 43:08.600
Some people will dress in roleplay, though,

43:08.600 --> 43:10.760
and there are some parties devoted entirely to roleplay.

43:11.320 --> 43:13.400
Yes, you may sit and observe if you don't feel like playing.

43:13.400 --> 43:16.040
No one is forced to play,

43:16.040 --> 43:18.440
and many parties have the attendees wear stickers

43:18.440 --> 43:21.560
that show the orientation for their night.

43:21.560 --> 43:23.000
Top, bottom, or switch.

43:25.560 --> 43:28.040
I just threw a can across the room because I was so like,

43:28.040 --> 43:29.560
yes, I gave blood today.

43:30.360 --> 43:31.720
This is a crazy sticker.

43:31.720 --> 43:36.680
And include a designation for observer or newbie.

43:36.680 --> 43:38.360
As Phil pointed out, you may be encouraged to play,

43:38.360 --> 43:39.480
but most people won't be pushy.

43:39.480 --> 43:41.080
If you're new, the best parties will give a new person

43:41.080 --> 43:42.920
a chance to feel comfortable before they start playing.

43:44.520 --> 43:46.040
Most parties do have an entrance fee

43:46.040 --> 43:47.880
or at least ask for a donation to cover costs

43:47.880 --> 43:49.720
or that the attendees bring a-

43:49.720 --> 43:50.360
What cost?

43:50.360 --> 43:51.720
Or that the attendees bring a-

43:51.720 --> 43:53.080
The aloe vera?

43:53.080 --> 43:55.880
Or that the attendees bring a covered dish to share.

43:57.240 --> 43:58.440
Who brought the fried kale?

43:58.440 --> 43:58.920
This is-

43:58.920 --> 43:59.400
Ow!

43:59.400 --> 43:59.880
Fuck!

43:59.880 --> 44:00.380
Ow!

44:00.380 --> 44:02.060
Not yet, Steve!

44:02.060 --> 44:03.020
Jesus fuck!

44:03.020 --> 44:04.140
Look at my sticker!

44:04.860 --> 44:05.900
I'm an observer!

44:05.900 --> 44:07.020
Check my sticker!

44:07.020 --> 44:07.580
Jesus!

44:08.940 --> 44:11.100
I'm the caterer to this big party.

44:12.140 --> 44:13.420
God damn.

44:13.420 --> 44:16.460
I'm clearly dressed in a more authoritative manner.

44:16.460 --> 44:18.060
I am the swanger!

44:18.060 --> 44:19.740
I like to wear a trench coat to the parties

44:19.740 --> 44:21.340
and tell them that I'm the covered dish.

44:25.100 --> 44:26.780
The best parties also offer the most

44:26.780 --> 44:27.820
for the least amount of cash.

44:27.820 --> 44:30.540
From what I've heard, Shadow Lane costs far too much

44:30.540 --> 44:31.500
for what is available.

44:31.500 --> 44:33.420
And I went to a Crimson Moon party

44:33.420 --> 44:35.500
and can say that the same is true for all of them.

44:35.500 --> 44:37.020
Crimson Moon, fuck you.

44:37.020 --> 44:38.220
Fuck you, that's made up.

44:38.220 --> 44:39.740
The most bang for the buck-

44:39.740 --> 44:40.540
Oh, this is promising.

44:40.540 --> 44:42.540
The most bang for the buck, from my experience,

44:42.540 --> 44:44.860
is the Texas All-State Spanking Party

44:44.860 --> 44:46.540
as their entrance fees are always low

44:46.540 --> 44:47.500
yet the party is huge,

44:47.500 --> 44:49.980
particularly the years that it takes place in Dallas.

44:49.980 --> 44:51.020
Road trip.

44:51.580 --> 44:53.100
Griffin must go.

44:53.100 --> 44:55.020
I'm gonna shade down to a mustache.

44:55.020 --> 44:58.140
I'm gonna fucking show up to that.

44:58.140 --> 44:59.100
Oh, God.

44:59.100 --> 45:00.780
Larger parties take place in hotels and resorts.

45:00.780 --> 45:02.460
Smaller parties usually at private residences.

45:02.460 --> 45:04.460
I enjoy the seclusion of a cabin party.

45:04.460 --> 45:05.420
There's something alluring to me

45:05.420 --> 45:07.420
at the public nature of a hotel party.

45:07.420 --> 45:09.020
There are also icebreaker games

45:09.020 --> 45:11.020
to get everyone comfortable when a party starts

45:11.020 --> 45:12.140
so spanking can begin.

45:12.780 --> 45:14.780
Demos, vendors, contests, and special events.

45:15.820 --> 45:16.300
Hey, guys.

45:17.100 --> 45:17.900
Just really quick.

45:19.980 --> 45:20.540
I mean, I get-

45:20.540 --> 45:23.660
Um, like, what's the-

45:23.660 --> 45:24.380
What's the-

45:24.380 --> 45:28.300
Does it go trust falls, then low ropes activities,

45:28.300 --> 45:30.300
and then you fucking punish someone's-

45:30.300 --> 45:31.500
Just punish that ass.

45:32.540 --> 45:33.260
What's the core-

45:33.260 --> 45:34.140
What is the-

45:34.140 --> 45:35.180
Explain to me.

45:35.180 --> 45:36.540
You played the minister's cat.

45:36.540 --> 45:37.100
It's-

45:37.100 --> 45:40.060
No, it's name game, keep the balls in the air,

45:40.620 --> 45:42.460
and then paddle till bloody chumps.

45:42.460 --> 45:44.300
Just fucking wail on that ass.

45:46.300 --> 45:49.660
Punish that student, and then you go back to low ropes.

45:49.660 --> 45:52.300
Is it light as a feather, stiff as a board,

45:52.300 --> 45:55.020
and then cat and nine tails, or-

45:55.020 --> 45:56.220
I can never remember.

45:56.220 --> 45:58.220
See, I like to use spanking to break the ice

45:58.220 --> 45:59.420
before I do something uncomfortable.

45:59.420 --> 46:00.380
Like, hey, I'm Justin.

46:01.340 --> 46:01.740
Low ropes-

46:01.740 --> 46:02.940
Ask to borrow money or something.

46:02.940 --> 46:03.820
You want some Sprite?

46:06.940 --> 46:08.060
Hey, I have a Yahoo.

46:08.060 --> 46:08.380
Yeah.

46:08.380 --> 46:08.940
Okay.

46:08.940 --> 46:10.060
I'd like us to explore.

46:11.500 --> 46:13.180
This one was sent in by Terry Dutton.

46:13.180 --> 46:13.660
Thanks, Terry.

46:13.660 --> 46:13.980
It's by-

46:13.980 --> 46:16.060
Take that thing for Terry Dutton.

46:16.060 --> 46:16.620
Terry Dutton.

46:16.620 --> 46:18.540
Terry Dutton sent this in. Thank you.

46:18.540 --> 46:22.540
It's by a Yahoo Answers user, Morgan Gretman, who asks-

46:22.540 --> 46:23.820
Take that thing-

46:23.820 --> 46:24.860
It's Morgan Gretman.

46:24.860 --> 46:25.340
Morgan Gretman.

46:26.140 --> 46:28.460
Picking the perfect quote, opinions needed.

46:29.660 --> 46:31.660
Getting a tattoo at the end of the month, and-

46:31.660 --> 46:32.540
Oh, no.

46:32.540 --> 46:34.860
I thought I had the perfect saying picked out,

46:34.860 --> 46:36.860
but I've come across a few more that I just love.

46:37.660 --> 46:40.300
If I could have all of them put on, I would.

46:41.420 --> 46:44.460
Just need opinions on which one sounds slash would look best.

46:44.460 --> 46:46.780
I am getting a horse tattoo on my back.

46:46.780 --> 46:47.660
Uh-huh.

46:47.660 --> 46:50.060
Not sure if it will be a rearing horse or a galloping horse,

46:50.060 --> 46:52.380
but here are the quotes I can't pick from.

46:54.860 --> 46:56.940
Elegance, beauty, spirit, fire.

46:56.940 --> 46:58.300
Uh-huh.

46:58.300 --> 46:58.780
Okay.

46:58.780 --> 46:59.340
So that's the first one.

46:59.340 --> 47:00.300
Not a quote.

47:00.300 --> 47:01.660
Not a quote at all.

47:01.660 --> 47:03.020
Two hearts, one passion.

47:03.020 --> 47:04.300
Nope.

47:04.300 --> 47:04.860
Okay.

47:06.460 --> 47:08.220
Hoofprints never fade.

47:08.220 --> 47:08.700
What?

47:08.700 --> 47:09.260
They not.

47:11.980 --> 47:13.020
They don't fade.

47:13.020 --> 47:14.460
They don't.

47:14.460 --> 47:15.180
Together.

47:15.180 --> 47:16.620
Scientifically proven.

47:16.620 --> 47:17.180
Wait, wait, wait.

47:17.180 --> 47:17.420
Okay.

47:17.420 --> 47:18.140
Go ahead, Griffin.

47:19.100 --> 47:20.060
Together as one.

47:21.580 --> 47:22.220
Wave.

47:22.220 --> 47:23.900
I was going to put this into the tattoo section,

47:23.900 --> 47:25.900
but who would know better than horse lovers themselves?

47:25.900 --> 47:27.820
I don't want any big long quotes or anything.

47:27.820 --> 47:29.740
Something small and simple, but gets to the point.

47:30.300 --> 47:32.220
That gets to the point of how I'm a crazy person.

47:32.780 --> 47:34.860
Is- wait, hold on.

47:34.860 --> 47:37.420
Two hoofprints, one passion.

47:38.460 --> 47:41.180
Two hearts, one passion, which I love.

47:41.180 --> 47:43.820
Like, what's- is the passion going?

47:43.820 --> 47:46.380
Like, just moving- moving forward quickly?

47:46.380 --> 47:47.660
Like, that's my thing.

47:47.660 --> 47:49.500
Also, what about that horse's second heart?

47:50.220 --> 47:51.020
Uh-huh.

47:51.020 --> 47:51.180
Yeah.

47:51.180 --> 47:52.060
Didn't think about that.

47:52.060 --> 47:52.300
Time works.

47:52.300 --> 47:53.820
Time works.

47:53.820 --> 47:58.460
What do you want to bet this person does not in any way own a horse?

47:58.460 --> 47:59.340
No, no horse.

47:59.340 --> 48:01.980
Really, they want to remind themselves to save up for it.

48:01.980 --> 48:04.460
And they think that this is sort of throwing their hat over the fence.

48:04.460 --> 48:05.980
Like, if you get this, you got to have a horse.

48:05.980 --> 48:07.340
People are going to think you're an asshole.

48:07.340 --> 48:11.100
Elegance, beauty, spirit, fire.

48:11.100 --> 48:11.900
Fire.

48:11.900 --> 48:16.060
Hey, the way that you ride a horse is really bad if fire's involved in the equation.

48:17.100 --> 48:19.660
Maybe you leap through fire as you're going to rescue-

48:19.660 --> 48:20.860
Oh, I ride a-

48:20.860 --> 48:24.700
What shitty quotes did they have before that they heard these and went,

48:24.700 --> 48:25.900
oh no, that's way better.

48:26.540 --> 48:27.900
Now I'm up in the air.

48:27.900 --> 48:30.140
Do- uh, did anybody make any suggestions or anything?

48:31.340 --> 48:34.300
Uh, a lot of people are down with elegance, beauty, spirit, fire.

48:34.300 --> 48:35.900
Yeah, it's very elegant.

48:35.900 --> 48:37.500
A rearing horse would be better.

48:37.500 --> 48:39.740
Um, I really like hoofprints never fade.

48:39.740 --> 48:41.180
But here are some you may like.

48:42.380 --> 48:43.500
Oh, Christ.

48:45.340 --> 48:48.060
In riding a horse, we borrow freedom.

48:48.060 --> 48:48.940
Do we know?

48:48.940 --> 48:50.220
If you mind if I, uh-

48:50.220 --> 48:51.180
Excuse me, horse.

48:51.180 --> 48:51.820
Can I get a cup of freedom?

48:51.820 --> 48:52.860
Can I just for a second?

48:52.860 --> 48:54.380
Let me- that freedom looks pretty neat.

48:54.380 --> 48:55.180
Can I just check it?

48:56.060 --> 48:57.260
Pardon me, neighbor.

48:57.260 --> 48:58.540
Can I get a cup of freedom?

48:59.980 --> 49:01.660
And the horse just looks back and says,

49:01.660 --> 49:03.260
you look with your eyes, not with your hands.

49:03.260 --> 49:05.340
Hey, I am bone dry on freedom.

49:05.340 --> 49:07.260
Can I just mount you for a second?

49:07.260 --> 49:08.940
And just a little-

49:08.940 --> 49:11.740
To ride a- to ride a-

49:11.740 --> 49:12.540
Alright, can I finish?

49:14.220 --> 49:16.620
To ride a horse is to ride the sky.

49:19.580 --> 49:21.740
No, the problem I have with these quotes

49:21.740 --> 49:23.500
is that they're objectively untrue.

49:23.500 --> 49:25.260
To ride a horse is to ride a horse.

49:26.860 --> 49:27.820
That's all you're doing.

49:28.940 --> 49:31.660
It's a galloping bundle of bones and meat

49:31.660 --> 49:33.100
and you're riding it and that's-

49:33.100 --> 49:36.220
Hoofprints do in fact fade pretty quickly.

49:36.220 --> 49:37.580
They barely even think.

49:37.580 --> 49:38.700
Like, what are you doing?

49:38.700 --> 49:40.780
My horse is made of clouds and fire

49:40.780 --> 49:42.220
and it sucks to be on it.

49:42.220 --> 49:43.580
It sucks to touch this horse.

49:45.260 --> 49:47.340
Horses lend us the wings we lack.

49:48.380 --> 49:48.780
What?

49:48.780 --> 49:50.780
You're making these up by yourself now.

49:50.780 --> 49:51.580
I'm not making these up

49:51.580 --> 49:53.340
because I'm not a fucking crazy person.

49:53.980 --> 49:56.220
Hey, everyone, quit borrowing shit from horses.

49:56.780 --> 49:59.260
Like, they're not good lenders.

50:00.540 --> 50:03.260
Neither a borrower or a lender or a horse me.

50:03.820 --> 50:04.220
That's my-

50:04.220 --> 50:04.940
To see what-

50:04.940 --> 50:06.220
For poor Richard.

50:06.220 --> 50:07.580
To see what man has made,

50:07.580 --> 50:08.620
one must get in a car.

50:08.620 --> 50:10.780
To see what God has made, one must get on a horse.

50:11.420 --> 50:14.140
No, to see what God has made, one must get in a horse.

50:16.940 --> 50:17.900
Nice work, Big G.

50:18.860 --> 50:21.260
You really grossed me out with all these horse parts.

50:21.260 --> 50:23.100
Big G, this is some sticky stuff.

50:24.300 --> 50:27.180
To be fair, I did think I was gonna freeze to death out here.

50:27.180 --> 50:27.900
Oh, thank you.

50:28.540 --> 50:30.940
Hey, Big G, I thought these were so bad on the outside.

50:31.980 --> 50:34.380
Hey, horse, can I borrow your-

50:34.380 --> 50:35.020
Well, your life.

50:35.020 --> 50:37.500
Uh, you may not get this one back for a while.

50:37.500 --> 50:40.140
Hey, horse, can I borrow your heat guts so I don't die?

50:41.020 --> 50:43.500
I need your guts heat to keep my bones warm.

50:44.140 --> 50:45.340
You're so good inside.

50:45.340 --> 50:45.660
Thank you.

50:47.340 --> 50:48.060
How about this quote?

50:48.060 --> 50:49.580
I'm gonna build a chair from your bones.

50:50.300 --> 50:51.100
How about this quote?

50:51.100 --> 50:54.700
To ride a horse is to borrow the entire Billy Joel discography.

50:54.700 --> 50:56.140
How did they figure?

50:56.940 --> 50:59.260
Because it makes as much sense as anything else.

51:01.020 --> 51:01.580
If your horse was-

51:01.580 --> 51:04.940
This is moving out, then I'm moving out.

51:04.940 --> 51:08.060
To fly a horse up in the sky is you are high.

51:08.060 --> 51:10.220
You are having a reaction to drugs.

51:10.220 --> 51:11.580
This is a different answer.

51:11.580 --> 51:12.860
If your horse is a racehorse,

51:14.380 --> 51:17.020
you were a great champion when you ran the ground shook.

51:17.020 --> 51:19.180
The sky opened and mere mortals parted,

51:19.180 --> 51:20.540
parted the way to victory.

51:20.540 --> 51:22.300
Where I'll meet you in the winner's circle,

51:22.300 --> 51:24.220
where I'll put a blanket of flowers on your back.

51:25.340 --> 51:25.580
Okay.

51:25.580 --> 51:27.340
So like a head to toe tattoo.

51:27.900 --> 51:29.820
Why were the mortals on the track?

51:29.820 --> 51:31.500
Get out of the way.

51:31.500 --> 51:33.500
Get out of the way, there's horses.

51:34.700 --> 51:37.580
I feel like horses are kind of like,

51:38.540 --> 51:41.740
kind of like you were talking about with like cats and other house pets.

51:41.740 --> 51:44.700
Can we just leave horses alone?

51:44.700 --> 51:47.820
Can we just let them run free and beautiful?

51:47.820 --> 51:50.540
And not try to capture their essence with your back meat?

51:51.580 --> 51:56.700
It's gotta be rough because anyone can become a cat person just by buying a cat.

51:56.700 --> 52:01.100
You can buy a cat nowadays and take care of it for its entire lifespan for like 15 bucks.

52:01.100 --> 52:01.980
Like NBD.

52:02.620 --> 52:05.740
Horses, you really gotta go for that crazy.

52:06.860 --> 52:08.700
That's a lifestyle change.

52:08.700 --> 52:10.700
A crazy, crazy lifestyle change.

52:10.700 --> 52:13.500
You can't just casually take off for the weekend.

52:14.220 --> 52:18.220
To be fair, have you ever watched Animal Cops Houston?

52:18.860 --> 52:19.180
Yes.

52:19.900 --> 52:21.740
It doesn't always require a life.

52:22.780 --> 52:25.740
Sometimes you're like, I brought this horse, it's in my apartment now.

52:25.740 --> 52:27.580
Oh shit, I forgot I had that horse.

52:28.220 --> 52:28.940
What?

52:28.940 --> 52:31.580
There's a horse behind your barn, you haven't fed it in three weeks.

52:31.580 --> 52:32.460
Oh shit!

52:32.460 --> 52:35.180
Stop, fuck, I haven't gone in that guest room in a long time.

52:38.860 --> 52:40.940
Let's do a Yahoo answer question.

52:43.020 --> 52:47.100
This one was sent in by Pandapocalypse.

52:47.740 --> 52:48.860
Thanks, you.

52:48.860 --> 52:52.540
It's by Yahoo Answers user, I'm all yours.

52:52.540 --> 52:59.740
Who says, who asks, best places for sex in college?

53:01.260 --> 53:03.900
Just curious, because sometimes it's hard to find a good place.

53:03.900 --> 53:07.100
I try to do it in my dorms sometimes, but it's not easy because I would never want to

53:07.100 --> 53:09.820
do it in front of my roommate, that would look horrible on my part.

53:09.820 --> 53:12.380
So please, what places did you have sex while you were in college?

53:12.380 --> 53:12.780
Thanks.

53:14.940 --> 53:16.620
There's only one place to do it.

53:16.620 --> 53:17.500
Yeah, in your bed.

53:18.300 --> 53:19.900
Dean's couch.

53:19.900 --> 53:20.400
Whoa!

53:22.300 --> 53:24.140
Sorry, Dean, asshole.

53:24.940 --> 53:26.620
McElroy!

53:26.620 --> 53:30.460
I just had some sex on your couch, Dean.

53:31.180 --> 53:36.700
Hey, big man, I just had sex on your couch, Dean, asshole.

53:36.700 --> 53:39.900
Don't sit on the middle cushion anymore, that one's mine.

53:39.900 --> 53:43.500
Hey, I'm cleaning that with my own human musk, Dean.

53:45.180 --> 53:47.740
Unhuman musk is the name of my college jam band.

53:47.740 --> 53:51.740
See those, see those wavy lines coming off it?

53:51.740 --> 53:53.020
That's my sex steak.

53:55.820 --> 53:57.100
I hate you, Dean.

53:57.100 --> 53:58.860
I hate you so much, Dean.

53:58.860 --> 54:00.620
Why wouldn't you let me into your college?

54:03.500 --> 54:04.700
I'm not a student here.

54:08.220 --> 54:09.820
Here's a, here's a fun suggestion.

54:09.820 --> 54:11.100
I think it's fun for the whole family.

54:11.100 --> 54:19.180
Uh, dress your kid like a, um, a doggy and then put it in a cage and then leave it home and go get drunk.

54:19.180 --> 54:19.680
What?

54:21.580 --> 54:25.180
Party for Halloween, the spirits are out tonight.

54:26.060 --> 54:31.900
Me and mom going out and you're gonna be alright in your cage we made for you.

54:33.660 --> 54:35.660
Just put some candy in there and it'll be fine.

54:35.660 --> 54:38.620
Put some candy in the clothes hanger cage that we made for you.

54:38.620 --> 54:42.140
You just re-bend them, you just bend them into bars.

54:42.140 --> 54:43.020
Babies aren't strong.

54:43.020 --> 54:43.900
It won't take long.

54:43.900 --> 54:45.980
Just go out and get drunk with mom.

54:45.980 --> 54:47.020
You guys deserve it.

54:47.020 --> 54:47.980
You've earned the night off.

54:50.220 --> 54:51.020
It's 10 p.m.

54:51.020 --> 54:52.220
Do you know where your baby is?

54:52.220 --> 54:53.180
Yes, in a cage.

54:53.180 --> 54:54.220
He's in the baby dog.

54:54.220 --> 54:55.900
It's okay, he's like, he dressed up like a dog.

54:56.620 --> 54:58.540
He's a baby dog, that much the better.

54:58.540 --> 55:02.540
The kind of irreparable harm you've done to your relationship by arguing about costumes.

55:02.540 --> 55:07.740
You gotta get on a retreat and by retreat, I mean go to Shakey's and get you drunk.

55:07.740 --> 55:12.460
Make sure you take lots of pictures of that too so that when your kid turns 18 and kills

55:12.460 --> 55:15.660
everyone he knows, you can show those pictures to the news.

55:15.660 --> 55:19.020
Just throw some Alpo in the cage and go get your drunk.

55:20.460 --> 55:21.500
Get that drunk.

55:21.500 --> 55:25.340
Mr. Stevenson, I'm sorry I'm placing you under arrest.

55:25.340 --> 55:28.700
Your son was locked in a cage unsupervised.

55:28.700 --> 55:29.340
What the fuck?

55:29.340 --> 55:30.620
That's a dog.

55:30.620 --> 55:31.420
That's a dog.

55:31.420 --> 55:34.300
That is actually your child in a dog.

55:34.300 --> 55:36.540
Well, color me embarrassed, officer.

55:36.540 --> 55:37.740
Look at his nose.

55:37.740 --> 55:40.060
I have painted it brown like a dog's nose is brown.

55:40.860 --> 55:43.180
Officer, you are terrible at improv games.

55:43.180 --> 55:45.660
I, yeah, you're supposed to say yes.

55:45.660 --> 55:46.860
Yes, and.

55:46.860 --> 55:47.820
Yes, and.

55:47.820 --> 55:50.300
Yes, and my baby's a dog in a cage.

55:51.100 --> 55:52.700
Yes, and do you want some of this beer?

55:52.700 --> 55:54.620
I have extra because we have so much in us.

55:57.500 --> 55:58.700
Do you want a brewski?

55:58.700 --> 56:00.940
And we'll forget about this and also forget about the kid.

56:00.940 --> 56:02.700
He's fine for another hour or so.

56:04.300 --> 56:05.500
Let's go play some foosball.

56:05.500 --> 56:07.820
Let's go play, let's go foos it up, copper.

56:09.500 --> 56:12.220
And then it turns out that the cop is a baby dressed as a cop.

56:13.660 --> 56:14.700
Incepted.

56:14.700 --> 56:17.980
Baby police, you just got busted by the highest authority in the land.

56:20.220 --> 56:20.940
Baby police?

56:20.940 --> 56:23.340
Baby police is the highest authority in the land, sentient baby.

56:23.340 --> 56:25.020
We are under baby martial law.

56:27.020 --> 56:29.660
It's adorable and also restrictive.

56:31.020 --> 56:32.780
This is a baby police state.

56:32.780 --> 56:37.900
All TVs will watch Nick Jr.

56:37.900 --> 56:39.660
All things will go boring when you hit them.

56:42.780 --> 56:44.940
The cow says moo, you say nothing.

56:46.540 --> 56:48.620
I snap my fingers, you pull out a tit.

56:48.620 --> 56:49.580
This is baby law.

56:52.140 --> 56:53.180
We're out of things now.

56:54.300 --> 56:58.940
You know, I would watch a legal drama called Baby's Law, which is about a baby lawyer.

56:58.940 --> 57:04.220
Yeah, um, babies don't grow up to be adults because this is what you do.

57:04.220 --> 57:06.460
You think about baby anarchy.

57:08.700 --> 57:11.180
Which is adorable and terrifying at the same time.

57:14.060 --> 57:15.820
This one was sent in by Diego McKinney.

57:15.820 --> 57:17.980
I'm almost certain Justin just looked at it.

57:17.980 --> 57:18.540
It's by Yahoo!

57:18.540 --> 57:20.380
Answers user Garland Garcia who asks,

57:20.380 --> 57:23.260
is it legal to have sex with trees on your own property?

57:24.700 --> 57:27.100
Oh, oh my.

57:27.100 --> 57:31.340
Now the top answer is unless the tree can be seen by a passerby, it's not illegal.

57:32.460 --> 57:35.340
It's not as if there's a precedent to making it illegal.

57:35.340 --> 57:38.540
Despite the foolishness of the question, I've decided to address it seriously.

57:39.100 --> 57:43.900
And I appreciate that, John Lennon, which is your username.

57:44.940 --> 57:46.460
I don't think that that's accurate.

57:46.460 --> 57:47.100
No, yeah, sure.

57:48.620 --> 57:51.980
Here's what's terrifying about this question and why I decided to discuss it.

57:51.980 --> 57:56.140
Now by accurate, do you think I meant the answer or the fact that that is John Lennon?

57:56.140 --> 57:58.060
Or the fact that there's no precedent for this.

57:58.060 --> 57:59.340
I know, I agree with that part.

57:59.340 --> 58:00.460
I don't agree with that.

58:00.460 --> 58:03.820
That is John Lennon's ghost in the machine,

58:03.820 --> 58:04.700
but he's trapped in Yahoo!

58:04.700 --> 58:07.100
Answers forever and he just wants out so bad.

58:07.100 --> 58:08.780
Please let him on another site.

58:08.780 --> 58:11.260
He can't find his way out because it's a labyrinth.

58:11.260 --> 58:12.220
Take it from me.

58:12.220 --> 58:15.180
Our show is really about trying to find John Lennon's ghost hidden in Yahoo!

58:15.180 --> 58:15.340
Answers.

58:15.340 --> 58:17.100
Hidden in the hedge maze of terrible.

58:17.100 --> 58:18.540
This is the closest we've ever gotten.

58:19.260 --> 58:24.460
Is this gentleman's concern that a tree would report him to the police?

58:24.460 --> 58:26.380
For tree sex, for arboreal sex crimes?

58:27.740 --> 58:29.020
I don't think that that's a concern.

58:29.740 --> 58:36.220
Then what other law besides just being completely indecent in public,

58:36.220 --> 58:39.660
which is a law no matter what you're having sex with.

58:39.660 --> 58:40.620
Wrongo.

58:42.540 --> 58:43.500
Wrongo.

58:43.500 --> 58:44.380
Here's what I'm saying.

58:44.380 --> 58:45.500
Here's what's upsetting.

58:45.500 --> 58:46.940
If your fence is high enough.

58:47.820 --> 58:49.340
People could be fucking trees all the time.

58:49.340 --> 58:50.700
People could be fucking trees.

58:50.700 --> 58:54.460
They could have trees fucking them or each other.

58:54.460 --> 58:57.740
They could have grown the trees into a position that makes it look like they're having sex.

58:57.740 --> 59:03.180
I'm talking about branches and the bird holes and the fucking man, a nasty mess.

59:03.180 --> 59:04.060
A nasty mess.

59:04.060 --> 59:06.540
Is your concern that this is like rampant?

59:06.540 --> 59:08.060
I'm saying who knows?

59:08.060 --> 59:11.020
If you walk by a house with an eight foot fence,

59:11.020 --> 59:14.460
you just go ahead and assume that they are fucking something they should not be.

59:14.460 --> 59:14.620
Yeah.

59:14.620 --> 59:15.980
And spray paint on the fence.

59:15.980 --> 59:17.580
Tree fuckers go home.

59:17.580 --> 59:17.820
Yeah.

59:17.820 --> 59:23.020
And then just spend every night worrying about white ash beetles.

59:25.260 --> 59:25.980
Termites.

59:26.780 --> 59:29.580
I mean, I think people are stumping on the reg.

59:30.300 --> 59:30.780
You do?

59:30.780 --> 59:33.500
I think people are stumping right now somewhere in this world.

59:33.500 --> 59:34.460
That explains.

59:34.460 --> 59:35.340
Okay.

59:35.340 --> 59:36.940
Now I get the t-shirts.

59:37.580 --> 59:38.860
Stumpers have wood.

59:39.420 --> 59:39.660
Yeah.

59:39.660 --> 59:48.620
I get it now.

59:48.620 --> 59:53.500
It upsets me that we can find loopholes in the legal system to allow this kind of thing.

59:53.500 --> 59:56.700
Aren't laws supposed to keep you from doing really upsetting things?

59:56.700 --> 59:57.340
Isn't that the whole idea?

59:57.340 --> 01:00:01.660
I want the fucking law and order special victims unit to kick in the door and be like,

01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:02.700
hey, sex police.

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:03.260
Don't move.

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:05.740
Why do we even have special-

01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:07.580
Down on the floor, tree fucker.

01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:07.820
Yeah.

01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:11.500
Why even have the SVU if they're not going to stop shit like this from happening?

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:12.860
Because psychically, it's in my brain.

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:16.940
Like, there's a tiny, here's what you guys may not realize about my brain is just by

01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:19.900
saying that word, saying like tree fucker.

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:24.940
Now in my brain, there's constantly a 24-7, till the day I die, a tiny man fucking a

01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:25.980
tiny tree in my brain.

01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:29.500
And he's just shouting, tree fucker, tree fucker, tree fucker, tree fucker.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:33.820
Or tree man, penis, intercourse, intercourse, intercourse.

01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:36.300
Like, it can't be stopped.

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:37.260
Please stop the noise.

01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:38.540
But you can't stop the noise.

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:42.700
I want fucking iced tea to kick in the door and be like, stop SVU.

01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:44.140
And he can't do that in your brain.

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:44.700
He's got to stop-

01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:45.020
Hold on.

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:46.540
I got to incept him in there.

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:47.100
Get him out.

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:47.820
Brain iced tea.

01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:53.100
Griffin's eyeballs are bleeding.

01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:55.500
I think he incepted too much.

01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:58.220
Don't have sex with trees.

01:00:58.220 --> 01:00:59.820
Don't have sex with-

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:04.780
If only to avoid the horrifying half-human, half-tree babies.

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:07.100
And also the dick splinters.

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:07.820
Stop it.

01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:09.020
Listen, you motherfuckers.

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:10.700
Dryads have to come from somewhere.

01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:13.420
I want them to walk the earth, and this is the only way to get it done.

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:14.460
It may not be pleasant.

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:15.340
It may not even be-

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:19.740
It's questionably illegal, but if we're going to have someone to bestow upon us,

01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:21.980
like, special tree powers and stuff-

01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:22.700
Dryad magic.

01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:23.980
Dryad magic, man.

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:29.900
I would like to imagine that dryad babies are just completely, like, boring and normal people.

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:32.700
And you see, like, a half-human, half-tree, and you're like, give me your wisdom.

01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:35.020
And he's just like, dude, I work at the plant.

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:35.740
I got nothing.

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:37.340
No pun intended.

01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:38.700
I work on my ship models.

01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:43.260
When you guys were younger, did you ever read The Taking Tree?

01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:47.260
Take a tree.

01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:50.700
Give me that sap.

01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:53.180
God.

01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:55.100
Oh, I'm sad in my brain.

01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:58.860
Yeah, me too.

01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:04.300
Hey, this Monday, my wife and I will find out if we are indeed going to be parents.

01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:09.180
We're excited at the possibility and have started trying to plan ahead things to get.

01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:12.380
One area we're stuck in is a baby-themed room.

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:15.420
We wanted something different from the normal animal-themed room.

01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:15.900
Whoa.

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:17.020
Whoa, y'all.

01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:17.520
Whoa.

01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:19.900
Animal-themed rooms.

01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:21.900
No, we're sticking with Aminal.

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:26.220
And felt that the Wise Brothers 3 would provide us with some great thoughts.

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:29.580
That's from confounded in KC.

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:37.580
I'm gonna throw out, and this is kind of meta, but what about a baby-themed, baby-themed room?

01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:38.860
Oh, man.

01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:41.260
And you just paint babies all over the walls.

01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:44.060
Yeah, and like with signs like, you are this.

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:45.100
Like, I love that.

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:49.740
I think that's important for human beings to know what and who they are pretty much instantly

01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:51.420
so they can start growing and learning from it.

01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:53.580
Like, I think you learn from yourself.

01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:57.500
Maybe instead of a baby, it's like a zygote.

01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:59.660
Or like a fetus.

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:02.780
And you're like, you were this, now get better.

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:04.060
Ooh, I like that.

01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:11.020
What if you took it as an educational thing and you put just a ton of objects in the room

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:17.500
that would say, maybe like out loud, perhaps with one of the greeting card sound chips,

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:19.660
they would say out loud what they are.

01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:24.060
But they would all do it at the same time, and they would do it 24 hours a day.

01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:28.860
Chair, chair, chair, chair, chair, chair, chair, chair, chair, chair, chair.

01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:29.820
Bad, bad, bad.

01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:30.860
I am drums.

01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:32.300
I am drums.

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:33.340
Dad's hidden pot.

01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:34.540
Dad's hidden pot.

01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:35.340
Pump shoes.

01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:38.700
Why did you hide your pot in the baby's room, dad?

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:42.860
You had to touch one of them and it just said, baby, baby, baby.

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:44.940
And just be Justin Bieber.

01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:52.220
Oh, that would be, that would make for probably a Unibomber.

01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:54.460
That would probably make for a Unibomber situation.

01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:55.740
How was my babyhood?

01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:56.460
I will tell you.

01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:59.340
Not great, because I'm looking at that lamp and it's screaming in my brain.

01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:01.500
So it could be better.

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:05.420
All I could think of when I blew out the building was, well, that's one building of things that

01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:09.020
won't be screaming at babies today.

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:10.060
Building, building, building, building.

01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:11.020
Building, building.

01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:11.980
Windows, windows.

01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:14.220
Windows, I have to kill the building.

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:18.860
But now it's screaming pit, empty pit, empty pit, empty pit.

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:22.060
It's just like my heart, heart, heart, heart.

01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:33.500
Hey, can we, can we, I want to take a brief hiatus here to tell you about the text.

01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:34.300
Oh, yeah.

01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:37.500
That I just got from my father, our father.

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:38.140
Did you guys get-

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:39.100
Me too, yes.

01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:46.780
Okay, so he just sent a text that says, in quotes, what day is it, son?

01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:47.500
What day?

01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:53.100
What could that, is that a reference to the hit film We Are Marshall?

01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:53.580
I think it is.

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:54.780
It has to be.

01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:55.740
Oh, but it's-

01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:58.620
I think the response to that is football day or something.

01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:01.420
No, listen, listen, let's explain this because people are going to think our dad is like

01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:02.940
some sort of crazy 9-11 guy.

01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:05.820
I don't think he knows it's 9-11.

01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:09.980
I think the three of us should probably text him.

01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:13.660
I'm texting him right now and I'm asking him if he means September 11th.

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:15.340
Okay, hold on, let's all take a moment.

01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:19.420
We need to, we need to text him back because I don't want our dad like walking through

01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:21.340
the day with like a spring in his step.

01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:23.020
It's game day!

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:25.020
Hey, everybody, are you excited?

01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:28.220
Okay, my message is sent.

01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:31.580
I look, I've been looking forward to the day for so long.

01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:36.700
Yeah, it seems like it's been 10 years since this last happened, by which I mean football.

01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:41.100
I love football, getting the points, scoring points.

01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:42.300
I get all the points.

01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:47.020
This one was sent in by Jesse Thorn.

01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:49.260
Thank you, Jesse.

01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:52.780

01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:53.820
Oh, oh my.

01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:56.460
Who asks, ladies.

01:05:58.460 --> 01:05:59.260
Already winning.

01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:05.980
Ladies, if someone paid you $300,000 or pounds to sit on a real human skull, would you sit on it?

01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:07.980
What?

01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:10.540
Would you cross your legs?

01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:13.020
If you did, you would get an extra $300,000.

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:15.980
I have actually asked this question before.

01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:19.980
Sincerely, Skeletor.

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:24.460
Love, Jack Skellington.

01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:26.620
So many questions.

01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:33.100
So many questions, first off, ladies, if you pick the $300,000 above the 300,000 pounds,

01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:34.540
then you are a rube.

01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:37.180
Yeah, I was gonna say conversion rate.

01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:38.140
I think maybe that's it.

01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:39.500
It's like a deal or no deal thing.

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:42.620
Like you could take the $300,000 or-

01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:45.180
Or 600,000 if you crossed your legs while you do it.

01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:50.860
Or you can get it in pounds and have to spend 10 minutes getting it converted at a bank.

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:54.460
Yeah, but that's an awkward story to tell the cashier.

01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:56.860
Hey, how'd you get these 600,000 pounds?

01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:59.020
I sat on a real human skull.

01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:04.380
These smell like calcium and taint.

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:06.700
Are you one of those bone jockeys?

01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:07.740
Are you a bone jockey?

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:11.580
You're people sick of me.

01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:14.300
Hey, Carl, we got another one.

01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:17.260
Look at this one.

01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:19.100
She sat on a human skull.

01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:20.060
She got boned.

01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:22.380
And then they all chuckle, chuckle.

01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:24.380
There are so many questions.

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:25.420
God damn it.

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:30.300
Is this skull inside of skin and muscles of a living human being?

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:33.500
Is it a last request kind of thing?

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:34.940
Is this how someone wants to get buried?

01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:36.620
It's what I'm saying.

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:37.980
Is this a Devo video?

01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:40.620
Are we talking about a Devo?

01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:42.700
Is this a Devo right now?

01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:44.140
Are you pulling a Devo on us?

01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:46.780
Like a bloody Devo?

01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:52.700
Why does the price point start out at $300,000?

01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:55.100
Why wouldn't you, why wouldn't you haggle up?

01:07:56.380 --> 01:08:00.620
I just noticed in the related questions on the sidebar,

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:03.900
this question by Miserable Little Smug Bastard.

01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:09.420
Ladies, if someone paid you $100,000 or pounds to sit on a real human skull, would you do it?

01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:14.460
He's driving a hard part.

01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:17.340
If you're offended by this question.

01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:21.420
What do I have to say to get you on this skull before you leave today?

01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:23.420
If you're offended by this question, then ignore it.

01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:24.300
Would you cross your legs?

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:25.500
If you did, you would get extra.

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:27.260
It would be the skull of a serial killer.

01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:28.320
What?

01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:31.740
You laughed that out when you brought it to $300,000.

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:32.220
Who?

01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:34.060
He's trying to, he's driving a deal.

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:35.100
He's trying to make this happen.

01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:36.780
Griffin, what is this username again?

01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:39.740
Miserable Little Smug Bastard.

01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:40.300
Okay.

01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:42.380
Miserable Little Smug Bastard.

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:45.260
He's like, he's been negotiating this.

01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:49.660
He's, for all his foibles, he's a pretty smart negotiator.

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:52.220
He started low and made a serial killer skull.

01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:55.580
He's like a, he's like a Ron Popeil.

01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:57.660
Like, okay, I'll take out.

01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:01.020
It's no longer a serial killer skull, just a regular skull.

01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:02.620
Just a real human skull.

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:04.780
And also this set of Sham Wows.

01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:08.380
Yeah, I will throw in a solid flavor injector.

01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:11.340
Oh God.

01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:16.780
Would you slap chop a real human skull for, I'm gonna, I'm gonna bump it up to 400k.

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:22.460
You do have to sit on it before, but afterwards you'll slap chop it into non-existence.

01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:23.660
It'll just be dust.

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:27.500
I will sit on two horse skulls for 50k.

01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:32.860
You know, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that this is one of those circumstances

01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:36.700
where I would rather that this were not a hypothetical question.

01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:42.220
Because if he had some purpose behind this, for some reason that makes it okay than him

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:43.740
just sitting around wondering.

01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:51.420
Travis, the amount of work that he has put into negotiating, just yelling into the internet,

01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:54.620
it has to have been resolved, right?

01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:56.780
It has to, it has to have happened.

01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:57.580
It has to have.

01:09:58.460 --> 01:09:59.660
Has to have happened by now.

01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:03.980
Do you realize how much money 300,000, what would I not do for $300,000 or pounds?

01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:07.100
Because to sit on a real human skull?

01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:07.580
Yes.

01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:08.620
It ain't on that list.

01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:12.140
Yeah, I would make the skull.

01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:13.420
I would.

01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:14.300
Night and waiting.

01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:20.220
I would turn the person into a skull, is what I'm saying.

01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:26.700
I'm such a fucking sucker though, because that first time around, when he's like 100k,

01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:28.620
I would have jumped at it.

01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:29.260
You would have taken it.

01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:31.100
I wouldn't even thought to hold off.

01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.900
You've got to check the trade magazines.

01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:36.300
What's the going rate right now?

01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:42.460
You know, I actually got a Groupon for sitting on a human skull.

01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:45.740
Yeah, a bunch of my friends and I are going to do it for 50k.

01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:46.220
The problem is-

01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:47.020
The same skull?

01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:50.140
Yeah, it's the same skull, so there's always a huge line.

01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:50.860
You really got to-

01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:55.500
And after a while, you know, it gets warm.

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:57.180
That skull is pretty rowdy.

01:10:57.180 --> 01:11:01.900
The thing is, he doesn't even clarify and say like, you have to be nude, or it has to be set.

01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:05.100
He just wants you to sit on it, cross your legs, and get off and leave.

01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:05.580
Can we-

01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:07.180
Let's talk about the crossing the legs thing.

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:11.100
Is he wanting us to incubate this skull like a mama bird?

01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:14.140
Keep it secret.

01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:15.180
Keep it safe.

01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:16.220
You get $300,000.

01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:20.380
But he doesn't say naked.

01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:23.740
So what he's saying is, just sit on.

01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:25.980
Just roll up in your mom jeans.

01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:30.380
Roll up in your mom jeans, sit on it, cross your legs, get off, leave, get out of here.

01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:35.420
Okay, I need to know, can a human skull support the weight of a fully grown adult woman?

01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:37.180
It takes like 14 pounds of pressure to-

01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:42.620
We are just skeletons with a big egg on top of our necks.

01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:45.980
So it's just a big egg in there?

01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:46.780
It's just a big-

01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:50.780
It's just like a big stupid egg in there, and it's if a human being-

01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:51.660
If it was like a tiny-

01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:53.420
If it was a baby, maybe, but-

01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:58.540
Oh, maybe he's doing that age old seventh grade science experiment where you have to

01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:02.220
build a bridge to save an egg, you know what I mean?

01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:04.300
And you have to walk across it and see if it destroys the egg.

01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:07.500
Travis, there was so much goddamn dumb stuff in that sentence.

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:09.820
You just said it would take us a week to tear it apart.

01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:13.180
It was.

01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:15.100
It was a seven layer bar of dumb shit.

01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:16.460
You know, an egg bridge.

01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:17.660
You know, egg bridge.

01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:18.780
I saw it on Mr. Wizard.

01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:21.980
You literally just confused like five different science projects.

01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:26.300
I was like, you know, an egg bridge, and then you put baking soda on it, and-

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:27.340
And it's a volcano.

01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:28.380
It's a volcano.

01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:32.780
Let's stop talking about sitting on skulls, because it's literally making my grundle

01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:33.740
uncomfortable.

01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:38.300
Like, just the thought of trying to perch myself on a cranium.

01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:39.340
I don't think it would feel good.

01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:41.740
No, I wouldn't think so.

01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:43.260
But you know what would feel great?

01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:45.580
I could buy myself a new grundle with 300k.

01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:47.980
Or 300 pounds.

01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:48.780
Jesus Christ.

01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:51.100
This guy.

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:52.380
This fucking guy.

01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:54.940
Do you think he's normal in his day to day?

01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:56.780
You think it's somebody really nice and well respected?

01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:57.980
Do you think it's Tom Hanks?

01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:03.420
Oh, couldn't- wouldn't you believe it if somebody was like, yeah, he's a great actor,

01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:05.020
and like, he's a real sweetheart.

01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:06.060
He's got this one thing.

01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:10.380
All right, everybody, we're going to wrap up.

01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:15.340
Hope you enjoyed that best out of episode as much as we enjoyed making those like 10

01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:16.380
or 11 episodes.

01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:18.220
I don't remember if I enjoyed making those episodes, Jared.

01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:19.020
I don't either.

01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:22.620
There's a pretty good chance I didn't enjoy making some of them.

01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:24.860
No, I don't remember what was going on in my life at that point.

01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:28.620
I think I referenced my girlfriend, Teresa, which sounds really weird at this point.

01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:32.300
It's like a weird time capsule to reopen these old episodes.

01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:33.420
But we hope you enjoyed them.

01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:39.020
We want to say- let's just start it off by saying thank you again to everyone who donated

01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:40.380
to Max Fun Drive.

01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:41.660
It was wildly successful.

01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:43.100
We felt incredibly supported.

01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:44.860
And here's the thing.

01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:51.020
Just so you know, if you weren't able to donate, but you still would like to become a sponsor,

01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:53.980
become a donor, you can do that at any point.

01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:56.700
You can go to maximumfun.org forward slash donate.

01:13:56.700 --> 01:14:01.180
You won't get the pledge gifts, but you can still support the network anytime you want

01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:01.660
to.

01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:03.260
Do you not get the bonus content?

01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:05.580
I think you still get the bonus content.

01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:09.900
If not, I will fight for you to still get the bonus content.

01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:11.580
Yeah, we will be in your corner.

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:15.420
But seriously, the response this year was absolutely bonkers.

01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:19.500
I cannot believe how many people came out to support our show.

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:24.860
It was a pretty amazing past couple of weeks, and we have you guys to thank for that.

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:26.220
So thank you all so much.

01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:29.020
Also, thanks to Blue Apron, who makes cooking at home easy.

What was that, Griffin?

01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:54.380
I just want to say we hit the genitals thing pretty hard when we talk about MeUndies, but

01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:58.060
usually it's like a goof thing.

01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:00.060
And you said that so casually.

01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:01.020
I don't know why.

01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:01.980
I just wanted to let you know.

01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:05.100
I wanted to stop the show and let you know that that one kind of bothered me.

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:06.620
That was the first one that bothered you?

01:15:06.620 --> 01:15:07.740
Yeah, I think it was.

01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:09.340
That was a sincere thank you, though.

01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:11.980
I really appreciate the support that MeUndies provides.

01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:15.820
We still have tickets to the Chicago show this coming Easter Sunday.

01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:20.460
Come, celebrate with your whole family.

01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:24.780
I know you're wondering, McElroy brothers, did you know that that was going to be Easter

01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:26.140
Sunday when you booked the date?

01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:30.220
And the answer is, but anyway, there's tickets available.

01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:32.860
Bit.ly slash MBMBAM Chicago.

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:38.300
Please send in your questions with the subject line saying which show you're going to be at.

01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:40.220
I need my Yahoo warriors.

01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:41.340
I need my Davenport's.

01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:42.220
I need my Sperling's.

01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:48.220
I need my Ray's to to step up and help me out, help me survive, because that's a lot

01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:50.220
of Yahoo's that we're going to need for all three shows.

01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:52.300
It's three shows worth of questions, people.

01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:53.180
We need your help.

01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:53.740
Have we done?

01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:56.940
I know we did three shows in one day before, but this is the first time we're going to

01:15:56.940 --> 01:15:58.700
three discrete cities.

01:15:58.700 --> 01:15:59.900
That is very excited.

01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:01.180
I'm very excited as well.

01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:07.180
At these shows, we've got some beautiful posters that Justin Gray, you can see some of his

01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:09.660
My Brother, My Brother and Me posters on the Max Fun Store.

01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:11.180
Go to maxfunstore.com.

01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:13.580
A bunch of merch there, just as a side note.

01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:16.700
Lots of awesome My Brother, My Brother and Me merch, some Sawbones merch.

01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:18.220
We're going to get some Adventure Zone merch.

01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:22.220
Yeah, we're going to be filling that up in over the next few months.

01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:26.060
So but go check out his posters there so you can get super excited.

01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:29.740
They're going to be show specific posters, which we've never done before.

01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:34.540
We're going to have one specific one for Milwaukee, one for Chicago, one for Minneapolis.

01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:37.500
Like, and they're beautiful, you guys.

01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:38.780
They're fucking awesome.

01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:40.140
They're like, they're fucking great.

01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:40.620
I'm definitely going to steal one.

01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:44.380
I'm ready to buy one so we can ride all over it and ruin it.

01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:49.500
And now that you've donated to the Max Fun Network, go listen to the other Max Fun shows.

01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:51.260
There's Jordan and Jesse Go.

01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:52.540
There's Judge John Hodgman.

01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:53.740
There's Throwing Shade.

01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:55.180
There's Pop Rocket.

01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:56.140
There's Rendered.

01:16:57.020 --> 01:16:58.780
There's a ton of really good shows.

01:16:58.780 --> 01:16:59.740
We do other ones.

01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:02.380
Travis does Bunker Buddies with his buddy Andy.

01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:05.900
Justin does a medical history show called Sawbones with his wife Sydney.

01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:12.700
Me and Justin and Travis and our dad do a Dungeons and Dragons podcast called The Adventure Zone.

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:17.500
A bunch of people have asked, now that we've hit all of our goals and everything,

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:21.580
we're going to totally make my sister, my sister and me bonus episode happen.

01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:22.860
A lot of people have been asking about it.

01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:24.940
A lot of people got really excited about it.

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:26.300
We're going to make this happen, people.

01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:31.980
Fortunately, our wives got excited about it because I don't know about you,

01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:35.660
but I forgot to run that by Rachel before we said we'd do it.

01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:37.900
100% a swing and a miss.

01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:40.860
Teresa heard about it on the show as she listened that day.

01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:44.460
Yeah, I got a message from Rachel that day.

01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:45.900
Like, so I'm doing a podcast, huh?

01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:50.700
And then my response was, oh yeah, I forgot to run that by you first.

01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:56.540
We've talked about it before, but it hadn't become an extant idea.

01:17:56.540 --> 01:17:58.300
We are the fucking worst husbands basically.

01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:00.780
But start thinking about questions you want to ask our wives.

01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:02.380
It's going to be, I'm really looking forward to hearing.

01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:04.700
We don't know when that's, I don't know when that's going to go up.

01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:09.740
We're doing, so because we hit these pledge tiers,

01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:12.780
we're going to do two bonus episodes throughout the year for donors.

01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:15.340
One of them is going to be my sister, my sister and me.

01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:19.580
And we're also going to do, have we announced what the other thing is going to be?

01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:23.580
We're going to do a Freaky Friday swap with some other podcast on the Maximum Fun Network.

01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:24.700
Don't know what that's going to be yet.

01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:28.780
I got a few in mind, but we will see how it shakes out.

01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:30.380
So that should be very interesting.

01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:32.300
So it's going to be a pretty bonkers year.

01:18:32.860 --> 01:18:33.900
I've said bonkers a lot.

01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:35.820
Before we get past it, I want to say thank you.

01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:40.380
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of their theme song.

01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:42.620
It's a departure off of the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:44.220
It feels good, right?

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:45.020
It's like a very phonetically.

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:46.060
It does, it feels really good.

01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:47.100
I think it's iambic pentameter.

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:48.300
Yeah, it just flows.

01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:50.940
I think it's like one of those things where it's like those are words of power.

01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:54.700
Like Freemanship.

01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:57.100
Let's throw it back to, yeah, it's a Dovahkiin shout.

01:18:57.100 --> 01:19:03.420
Let's throw it back to the past and hit you up with that final Yahoo goodness.

01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:04.700
Thank you all so much for listening.

01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:09.340
We'll be back with probably one of our live shows next Monday.

01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:14.460
I promise at least one of the three of them is going to sound really good,

01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:15.900
and that'll be the one we throw up first.

01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:19.580
So thank you all so much for listening, and we will see you later.

01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:24.700
This final Yahoo was sent in by Galiayali.

01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:25.580
Thank you, Gali.

01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:27.900
It's by Yahoo Answers user question mark, who asks,

01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:31.980
did you ever guest star on the Golden Girls?

01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:36.460
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:37.660

This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:42.780
Kiss your dad.

01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:57.580
Squabble lips.
