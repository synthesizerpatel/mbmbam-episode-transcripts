00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.920
Hey everybody, welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:48.640 --> 00:53.040
I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:53.040 --> 00:58.880
I'm your sweet baby, baby brother, Griffin McElroy. And babykins? That's a new thing.

00:58.880 --> 01:03.760
Well, everybody. Blartwatch, Blartwatch is back. I'm on Blartwatch.

01:03.760 --> 01:08.240
Blarty in the USA. Did we have a maiden voyage for the SS Blartwatch?

01:08.240 --> 01:12.080
I'm pretty sure we Blartwatched before. This is Blartwatch 2. The game has done

01:12.640 --> 01:20.320
changed. Second weekend, Paul Blart Mall Cop was in a rough fight for second place with Furious 7.

01:20.320 --> 01:27.120
It's in the 13 to 14 million dollar range. That's how Blart is right now. It's gonna clear the 40

01:27.120 --> 01:31.600
million mark. It's domestic total by the end of the weekend, so it's gonna be a big picture,

01:31.600 --> 01:34.880
a big win for- And that's on a budget of how much?

01:34.880 --> 01:41.280
Eight dollars. Kevin James, the whole team stands to gain a lot of money.

01:41.920 --> 01:46.880
Everybody volunteered for that except for Kevin James and his only stipulation on his

01:46.880 --> 01:50.640
writer is that when they were done filming all of his scenes in the movie, they were gonna go

01:50.640 --> 01:56.080
to yogurt land and he was gonna get a cup of frozen yogurt. Ended up costing eight dollars

01:56.080 --> 02:02.080
because it was a considerable amount of yogurt. When I saw the billboard for Paul Blart Mall Cop

02:02.080 --> 02:10.320
2 and it said always bet on Blart and I laughed legitimately, a hearty belly laugh, and automatically

02:10.320 --> 02:14.720
$15 was deducted from my bank account. He got your money on one or the other.

02:14.720 --> 02:20.560
Yeah, and they were like that laugh ain't free. Now just to check in, you know Blart's not just

02:20.560 --> 02:26.320
about money, it's also a work of art and I think- A work of Blart. A work of Blart, thank you,

02:26.320 --> 02:31.200
I left the door wide open for that one. So just do you want to check in real quick, real quick on

02:31.200 --> 02:41.280
what the, what are the critics saying about Paul Blart? Just, just, let's see, Andy Webster says,

02:41.280 --> 02:48.480
you won't find much offensive in Kevin James's, Rick James's slick innocuous song Paul Blart Mall

02:48.480 --> 02:56.000
Cop 2. It's, it's, it doesn't believe in the worthiness of its hero, should why, why should

02:56.000 --> 03:00.720
we from Kimberly Jones? Kimberly Jones apparently wanting a little more action. A little bit of

03:00.720 --> 03:09.440
pathos sounds like. Pathos for Paul Blart. Very deep, the hero's journey. This is Ivan Morales

03:09.440 --> 03:13.680
from Cine Premier says, the only thing about, thing that stands out about this film is how hard

03:13.680 --> 03:18.800
it tries to be an average comedy. Now that review is in Spanish, so in case you're curious how

03:20.080 --> 03:23.520
Blart is playing with the Spanish-speaking audiences, the answer is not well.

03:23.520 --> 03:27.520
Wait, it's, wait, its biggest problem is that it tries really hard to be an average comedy,

03:27.520 --> 03:31.120
like it was a super above average comedy, it's like we gotta tone this down.

03:31.120 --> 03:36.240
Lost in translation here. Mike McHalehill from the Observer in the UK probably has the, the,

03:36.240 --> 03:40.560
the best review. He says, this isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film.

03:40.560 --> 03:44.080
The most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.

03:45.120 --> 03:49.920
So it kind of sounds to me like all these reviewers are biased and they're probably

03:49.920 --> 03:56.160
either being paid off or they're just, you know, they just have sort of a preternatural bias

03:56.160 --> 03:57.360
for Big Sandler.

03:58.320 --> 04:01.440
Wait, well, but what if he means when he says it's a fly's fart of a film,

04:01.440 --> 04:03.520
he means really funny to think about.

04:04.480 --> 04:07.520
Yeah, that's a good point, Travis, I didn't even think about that.

04:07.520 --> 04:15.680
Now, just to, just so we're clear, full disclosure, we do have a, a positive review

04:15.680 --> 04:21.120
here from Simon Weaving, who says, no more than an excuse for James to play out his affable

04:21.120 --> 04:27.440
brand of humor, mixing physical slapstick with verbose running commentary of both grandiose

04:27.440 --> 04:30.320
and self-deprecating observations on life and himself.

04:30.320 --> 04:34.080
Words too big, too big for Blart, those words are.

04:34.080 --> 04:38.960
See, all the reviews should just be like, at least Native Americans didn't walk off

04:38.960 --> 04:40.000
the set of this one.

04:40.000 --> 04:40.800
Paul Blart too.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.640
Yeah, they're ahead of the curve.

04:42.640 --> 04:47.760
Now, a lot of people are, are not critics, you know, a lot of people are just common

04:47.760 --> 04:53.200
folks, like user Billy Barnett at Rotten Tomatoes, he says, I just saw this last night

04:53.200 --> 04:54.640
and it's better than the first one.

04:54.640 --> 04:57.600
These critics are insane, don't trust them.

04:57.600 --> 05:01.840
The very first response is, having the runs is better than having full on diarrhea too.

05:01.840 --> 05:04.720
I'm not sure what that means.

05:04.720 --> 05:05.840
Wait, hold on.

05:05.840 --> 05:09.440
I thought those were synonymous, have I been wrong about diarrhea my whole life?

05:09.440 --> 05:12.320
I thought they were, they're apparently different.

05:13.120 --> 05:16.560
But I don't get, is he saying that like it's still bad, it's just not as bad as

05:16.560 --> 05:17.120
the first one?

05:17.120 --> 05:20.800
Because then the point still holds up, it's still better than the first one.

05:20.800 --> 05:26.240
There is one submitted quote from the film, submitted by Lucas B. five days ago, and it

05:26.240 --> 05:28.960
is this, it's a Paul Blart line, match.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.200
Where did all my ham go?

05:31.200 --> 05:35.200
I swear I left it right here.

05:35.200 --> 05:37.360
I had three hams and now I only have one ham.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.600
You're going to UCLA.

05:41.760 --> 05:44.960
Wow, okay, is that to himself in a mirror?

05:44.960 --> 05:45.920
That's the iconic.

05:48.560 --> 05:54.800
Nothing sums up the plot of Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 better than the line, you're going

05:54.800 --> 05:55.760
to UCLA.

05:55.760 --> 05:58.960
Yeah, going to UCLA.

05:58.960 --> 06:02.800
4% of critics liked it, 49% of audiences liked it.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.440
See, that's my real America.

06:05.440 --> 06:06.560
Let's get into some advice.

06:06.560 --> 06:10.560
Yeah, this is an advice show for the modern era where we don't just monitor the coming

06:10.560 --> 06:16.560
and goings of Paul Blart, but we will be bringing you those throughout the show, and throughout

06:16.560 --> 06:21.040
the show, by that I mean not just this episode, but for the entirety of our show.

06:21.040 --> 06:24.400
We'll continue to follow the actions of Paul Blart, but we also give advice to people.

06:24.400 --> 06:24.960
So let's do that.

06:24.960 --> 06:28.960
I can't wait until the third Paul Blart where he fakes his own death, and at the end

06:28.960 --> 06:34.400
Alfred just sees him sitting at a Venetian cafe, you know, and they make eye contact,

06:34.400 --> 06:36.160
and then he farts really loud.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.360
And he farts on a fly.

06:38.800 --> 06:41.920
He farts and a fly comes out of his butt, and then that fly farts too.

06:41.920 --> 06:47.600
And then it zooms in on his face, and the fly looks right into the camera, and it's

06:47.600 --> 06:51.440
a vignette effect, and it zooms in right on the fly's face, and he goes, you're going

06:51.440 --> 06:52.720
to UCLA.

06:52.720 --> 06:53.520
Cut to black.

06:53.520 --> 06:55.280
They opened that on your birthday, Griffin.

06:55.280 --> 06:56.560
Best birthday ever, yeah.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.240
Let's get into the advice.

06:58.240 --> 06:59.200
How was it?

06:59.200 --> 07:00.400
I'm assuming you went.

07:00.400 --> 07:01.040
It was pretty good.

07:01.040 --> 07:03.120
I wish the theater wasn't full of people jerking off.

07:03.760 --> 07:04.720
That was a weird touch.

07:05.280 --> 07:06.960
Okay, now I will get to the advice.

07:06.960 --> 07:07.760
No more Blart.

07:07.760 --> 07:11.360
How early is too early to start yard work?

07:12.160 --> 07:16.240
I live in a neighborhood of garden homes that are fairly close to one another.

07:16.240 --> 07:18.000
I don't have a large yard.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.160
It still requires regular maintenance, but because it isn't a project that takes more

07:22.160 --> 07:26.720
than an hour or two at most, I prefer to get in early so I don't spend a whole day doing

07:26.720 --> 07:26.880
it.

07:26.880 --> 07:31.200
Sometimes I do this on Saturday, but I usually have at least one free day during the week.

07:32.080 --> 07:36.720
This is starting to turn into like an SAT puzzle question, okay.

07:37.760 --> 07:39.280
Because he referenced two days of the week?

07:39.280 --> 07:40.320
Two days of the week.

07:40.320 --> 07:41.680
I don't know when those are.

07:41.680 --> 07:43.040
So my question is this.

07:43.040 --> 07:46.240
How early can I start while being courteous to my neighbors?

07:46.240 --> 07:47.680
And that's from Terry.

07:47.680 --> 07:51.280
Well, you got to go door to door, knock on everybody's door and make sure they're not

07:51.280 --> 07:53.200
about to start recording a podcast.

07:53.200 --> 07:55.920
That is a service that my neighbors do not provide to me.

07:55.920 --> 08:00.720
The good news is that there's never a time that people are happy to hear people doing

08:00.720 --> 08:02.480
yard work outside their house.

08:02.480 --> 08:07.200
I've never once heard someone mowing a lawn or using a leaf blower and thought, oh, good.

08:07.760 --> 08:08.320
Awesome.

08:08.320 --> 08:13.600
Unless your neighbor's dirty, dirty tall grass, hairy, and you get sight that he's

08:13.600 --> 08:15.280
about to, he's dealing with it fucking crazy.

08:15.280 --> 08:18.080
You're just psyched to find out what's in there.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.600
Maybe there's an old tricycle.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.400
Hey, if you see my wallet-

08:20.400 --> 08:23.440
One of those like turtle sandbox things.

08:24.640 --> 08:25.760
You guys speak for yourself.

08:25.760 --> 08:31.040
Every time I hear one of my neighbors revving up their engines, I get out there with a big

08:31.040 --> 08:32.880
thumbs up and I say, you go get them.

08:33.920 --> 08:35.520
You're doing it next door, Paul.

08:35.520 --> 08:40.960
I knock on their door afterwards and they're all sweaty from mowing and I say, hey, I just

08:40.960 --> 08:43.440
wanted you to know because not a lot of people are going to stop and say it.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.800
This looks great.

08:46.480 --> 08:47.360
You did a good job.

08:47.360 --> 08:53.360
And then they look in their hand and I somehow slipped a glass of ice cold iced tea into

08:53.360 --> 08:53.760
their hand.

08:53.760 --> 08:56.720
They don't know how I did it, but that's what being a neighbor is all about.

08:57.360 --> 08:59.920
But there's no, you didn't give them a cup.

09:01.120 --> 09:04.240
You've just poured a glass's worth of iced tea onto their hand.

09:04.240 --> 09:08.000
It's actually frozen and I say act fast, then I walk away.

09:08.640 --> 09:09.200
That's good.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.000
That's what they're doing.

09:10.000 --> 09:10.560
Give them a chore.

09:10.560 --> 09:10.800
Yeah.

09:10.800 --> 09:15.280
I think that 9, 9 a.m.

09:15.280 --> 09:15.520
Yeah.

09:15.520 --> 09:16.640
Wake the fuck up.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.040
What are you doing sleeping past 9?

09:19.760 --> 09:21.040
What are you what are you doing?

09:21.920 --> 09:24.880
Theresa and I are up like every day at 730.

09:24.880 --> 09:29.840
And I told someone this the other day and they were like, you know, a 28 year old adult

09:29.840 --> 09:32.560
person by all intensive purposes.

09:32.560 --> 09:36.880
And they said, oh, I never get up before 11.

09:37.680 --> 09:38.080
What?

09:38.080 --> 09:39.200
Like, what the fuck?

09:39.200 --> 09:41.120
What you're missing so much shit.

09:41.120 --> 09:41.360
Nobody.

09:41.360 --> 09:44.880
I don't care how fucking old you are or how late at night you had the previous evening.

09:44.880 --> 09:49.440
Nobody has any excuse to sleep past the end of the McDonald's breakfast menu.

09:49.440 --> 09:54.000
If you have slept and then if you wake up and McDonald's is serving lunch, you fucked

09:54.000 --> 09:54.640
up somewhere.

09:55.520 --> 10:01.360
What if like your baby was up all night like crying and you just got her to sleep and like

10:01.360 --> 10:04.400
you just want to sleep in a little bit?

10:04.400 --> 10:06.960
Like, is that not permissible where you go a little bit?

10:06.960 --> 10:09.120
A little bit a little bit is fine.

10:09.120 --> 10:10.720
I'm talking not past nine o'clock.

10:11.520 --> 10:12.800
That's crazy, though.

10:12.800 --> 10:13.840
That doesn't make sense.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.560
You have so much life to live.

10:16.560 --> 10:18.160
Yeah, there's so much to do.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.920
I want to have the energy to do it all day.

10:19.920 --> 10:23.920
Maybe now I'm not speaking for myself, but I'm the one who gets yelled at when our neighbors

10:23.920 --> 10:25.040
are mowing at 9 a.m.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.720
My wife wants to sleep in a little bit.

10:26.720 --> 10:29.600
I guess we're getting into a much broader question here.

10:29.600 --> 10:34.800
And that is of, let's say, 16 hours of the day.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.800
You got to be up for 16, right?

10:36.800 --> 10:40.560
And then you get your solid eight and then you're down and then you get you get your

10:40.560 --> 10:41.360
next 16.

10:41.360 --> 10:45.360
What are the 16 best hours of the day to be conscious?

10:45.360 --> 10:47.200
The golden 16.

10:47.200 --> 10:50.960
Because I think like I think it's it's hold on.

10:50.960 --> 10:52.640
Let me map this out real quick.

10:52.640 --> 10:56.160
I want to say it's like 7 to 11.

10:56.160 --> 10:56.560
I see.

10:56.560 --> 10:57.920
I was going to say 8 to 12.

10:58.960 --> 11:00.240
8 to 12 is fine, too.

11:00.240 --> 11:00.880
It's close enough.

11:00.880 --> 11:04.240
But I go with 7 to 11 and I feel like I never miss anything.

11:04.240 --> 11:05.760
Hey, here's the okay.

11:05.760 --> 11:06.720
Here's the real thing.

11:06.720 --> 11:11.360
And I guarantee there are some of you listening scientists, inventors, engineers.

11:11.360 --> 11:13.680
Why haven't we invented a quiet lawnmower yet?

11:14.400 --> 11:16.800
Like everybody hates the sound of the lawnmower.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.080
Make a quiet lawnmower.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.360
I'll step in here, Travis.

11:20.640 --> 11:22.960
They were for a really long time.

11:22.960 --> 11:24.160
There's already one invented.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.520
It's called the manual lawnmower.

11:27.360 --> 11:27.920
Remember?

11:27.920 --> 11:28.560
Remember?

11:28.560 --> 11:28.960
Okay.

11:28.960 --> 11:30.800
And why aren't we using that anymore, Justin?

11:30.800 --> 11:31.840
Because it sucks.

11:31.840 --> 11:32.400
It sucks.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.840
It's really, really wicked hard.

11:33.840 --> 11:38.800
Well, then let's make a quiet one that we just pull a switch or maybe something that

11:38.800 --> 11:39.520
does itself.

11:39.520 --> 11:40.640
We've got robots.

11:40.640 --> 11:41.680
One that does itself?

11:41.680 --> 11:42.880
You mean a goat?

11:45.440 --> 11:47.680
Are you speaking about a goat?

11:47.680 --> 11:50.880
Because we invented those a very long time ago.

11:50.880 --> 11:51.760
We took a deer.

11:51.760 --> 11:52.560
We took a sheep.

11:52.560 --> 11:54.080
We said, y'all two, fuck.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.200
And then you did.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.160
And a goat came out.

11:56.160 --> 11:57.040
Y'all want a Yahoo?

11:57.040 --> 11:57.600
Yeah.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.840
I would like more of this goat story, but sure.

12:00.480 --> 12:01.760
That's all there is to say.

12:01.760 --> 12:04.320
Deer, fuck that sheep.

12:04.320 --> 12:05.120
And he said, all right.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.200
I'm going to enjoy it, too.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.160
Maybe it's an antelope.

12:08.960 --> 12:09.760
Which came from?

12:09.760 --> 12:10.400
Never mind.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.720
This one Yahoo answer was sent in by Rachel Sperling.

12:12.720 --> 12:13.760
Recognize that game.

12:13.760 --> 12:14.400
Take a moment.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.040
Recognize it.

12:15.040 --> 12:15.920
Respect it.

12:15.920 --> 12:17.040
Appreciate it.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.400
You don't know what you got until it's gone.

12:18.400 --> 12:19.440
For later generations.

12:19.440 --> 12:20.320
Put it away.

12:20.320 --> 12:21.200
Don't use it all up.

12:21.200 --> 12:21.840
Thank you, Rachel.

12:21.840 --> 12:27.680
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jess, who asks, he's lying to me about boats.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.240
Boats.

12:30.240 --> 12:32.480
This is in the singles and dating category.

12:33.440 --> 12:38.160
Jess asks, so my boyfriend for the last few weeks has been talking about buying a boat.

12:38.160 --> 12:42.080
He will tell me about all these boats for sale and their prices and location.

12:42.080 --> 12:46.000
Says he is going to go look at them, but always after that says nothing more.

12:46.720 --> 12:49.120
He is only looking at them on this one site.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.680
Last night he was telling me about some boat for sale.

12:51.680 --> 12:55.200
I wanted to see it, so I searched for it on the site and it didn't exist.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.760
I then looked for all the boats he had told me about.

12:57.760 --> 12:58.640
Not there.

12:58.640 --> 13:02.160
My boyfriend does sometimes lie, but I don't know why he would lie about this.

13:02.160 --> 13:03.120
It's so weird.

13:03.120 --> 13:07.440
But I have noticed he will use these boats as an excuse when I'm supposed to see him.

13:07.440 --> 13:11.760
Like I'll say I'm coming over and he'll say he's driving to go look at a boat.

13:16.240 --> 13:20.240
Oh, I wish you had called 10 minutes ago.

13:20.240 --> 13:22.880
I know it's appointment to go see a boat.

13:22.880 --> 13:27.120
I know I'm supposed to make dinner and I know I promised by totally spaced and made a boat

13:27.120 --> 13:27.620
appointment.

13:28.960 --> 13:30.480
Is it possible he's saying butt?

13:31.600 --> 13:32.100
What?

13:32.720 --> 13:35.840
Like he's searching a website for butt, so he's gotta go see a butt?

13:35.840 --> 13:41.280
To buy and then telling his girlfriend about him in like detail?

13:42.000 --> 13:44.400
Does it make any more sense that he's talking about boats?

13:44.400 --> 13:48.320
Honey, I would love to come to your sister-in-law's birthday party,

13:48.320 --> 13:50.160
but I saw a butt on the internet.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.400
I've gotta get a closer look at it.

13:52.400 --> 13:53.920
I made an appointment to go buy it.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.280
I'm thinking about investing.

13:55.280 --> 13:56.320
It's a great market.

13:56.880 --> 13:58.320
Values are only gonna go up.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.720
Think about the fun we could have with that butt.

14:02.560 --> 14:03.520
It's not just for me.

14:03.520 --> 14:04.480
This is for you and me.

14:04.480 --> 14:05.600
This is for both of us.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.440
You always spend time on the butt.

14:07.440 --> 14:12.000
Remember when you used to tell me that the happiest times you could remember were at

14:12.000 --> 14:16.800
your grandma and grandpa's lake out on their pontoon butt just zipping around.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.880
Remember I'm trying to recreate that for you.

14:18.880 --> 14:20.960
This is wonderful.

14:20.960 --> 14:26.560
This is the perfect crime for getting out of things that this person clearly doesn't want to do.

14:26.560 --> 14:29.120
There's no way he's gonna get caught.

14:29.120 --> 14:31.760
One thing I am curious about is this line.

14:33.760 --> 14:37.920
I wanted to see it, so I searched for it on the site and it didn't exist.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.640
Then I looked for all the boats he had told me about, not there.

14:40.640 --> 14:42.640
What are those?

14:43.280 --> 14:47.120
I work on the web, so I'm very interested in web technology.

14:47.120 --> 14:50.960
I'm very interested in web technology search engine analytics.

14:50.960 --> 14:55.760
I'm really curious about the heuristics she would use to search for these boats to prove they don't exist.

14:55.760 --> 15:00.880
She just searched boats my boyfriend talked about and hit enter and nothing came up.

15:00.880 --> 15:10.720
There was a blue one and it had a propeller and he said we could have cool times out on the river.

15:12.160 --> 15:14.480
Search boat river propeller.

15:14.480 --> 15:19.280
Gotta put in quotes, cool times on the river. No boats available. This is so bizarre.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.760
Maybe I need to put plus signs between it.

15:21.760 --> 15:28.880
What if he is just inventing makes and models of boats to cover his tracks?

15:30.480 --> 15:33.920
I'm gonna go check out a float master 6000.

15:33.920 --> 15:35.840
It's actually the fish getter X.

15:35.840 --> 15:41.600
It's a new model and it got a really good price.

15:41.600 --> 15:47.520
How much? $20, $80,000?

15:47.520 --> 15:53.600
Can't you just picture her clicking through the site trying to find them and one by one as she enters search turns and nothing comes up.

15:53.600 --> 15:55.440
It's like zooming in on her face.

15:55.440 --> 16:00.720
It's like realization dawns and she can see a Kaiser Sose moment.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.720
There's no such thing as a Toyota big raft.

16:02.720 --> 16:06.720
I feel like such a fool.

16:06.720 --> 16:13.680
On the bulletin board there's like a Toyota flyer and over here there's a picture of Tom Sawyer on a raft and she starts putting it all together.

16:13.680 --> 16:16.160
Wait a minute and Mr. Big from Sex in the City.

16:16.160 --> 16:17.440
Hold on, hold the phone.

16:19.280 --> 16:20.320
Hold the phone.

16:21.280 --> 16:22.400
There's no boat.

16:23.680 --> 16:24.960
There's no such thing as boats.

16:26.320 --> 16:27.200
Maybe we've all been.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.440
I've definitely been out on boats before, Travis.

16:29.440 --> 16:30.800
I have to stop you right there.

16:30.800 --> 16:31.600
Have you?

16:31.600 --> 16:32.400
Oh my god, no.

16:32.400 --> 16:33.280
It was a dream.

16:34.240 --> 16:35.440
I got a question for you guys.

16:35.440 --> 16:38.480
I just passed the bar exam but one of my best friends from law school didn't.

16:39.600 --> 16:44.640
I know from law school that she's smart and a hard worker but this is the second time that she's failed the exam.

16:44.640 --> 16:53.520
Is there a way to talk to her or hang out with her in such that my whole situation doesn't just rub in that she's having problems with this test?

16:53.520 --> 16:58.080
What's the best way to be a supportive friend here that's from credentialed in the Carolinas?

16:58.080 --> 17:00.480
It's just a very hard test.

17:00.480 --> 17:01.680
Anybody can fail that.

17:01.680 --> 17:02.560
I could fail that.

17:02.560 --> 17:05.040
Franklin and Bash passed it.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.000
Who?

17:06.000 --> 17:06.880
Well, think about it.

17:07.840 --> 17:09.040
Both Franklin and Bash.

17:09.600 --> 17:10.720
I don't know who you're talking about.

17:10.720 --> 17:15.920
You know, from the hit TNT series Franklin and Bash starring Mark Paul Gosselaar and another guy.

17:17.520 --> 17:18.160
Sure.

17:18.160 --> 17:18.800
Wait, wait.

17:20.000 --> 17:20.960
I've almost got it.

17:21.680 --> 17:22.240
Nope.

17:22.240 --> 17:22.800
No, no.

17:22.800 --> 17:23.200
Brecken.

17:23.200 --> 17:27.120
That is the boat of TV shows.

17:27.120 --> 17:43.760
I think that if you're looking for a way to support your friend who didn't pass the test you just passed, might I suggest imparting some of the wisdom and knowledge that you used to pass the test you passed to help her pass this test that she wants to pass?

17:43.760 --> 18:01.200
Are we looking at a montage scenario where it's like we're going to do this together and it cuts to sessions of you sitting in what's probably like an old looking library because that's where law stuff is and you're pounding your fist and she's kind of going like, I don't get it.

18:01.200 --> 18:12.080
You take off your jacket and you spin the table and you cross saddle it and then you just look at it and you say, so habeas corpus and then it's another shot they've moved on.

18:12.080 --> 18:14.080
And then there's like one where you're-

18:14.080 --> 18:19.040
And then pretty soon she just nods and you see her scribble down, law, exclamation point in her book.

18:19.680 --> 18:20.720
I get it.

18:20.720 --> 18:25.600
And then Sean Connery from Finding Forrestal shows up and he's like, you're the new man now, dog.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.120
You're taking her old place.

18:27.120 --> 18:29.040
I think he's an important part of any montage.

18:30.160 --> 18:32.000
You're a lawyer now, dog.

18:32.000 --> 18:38.800
And his last film was an animated movie called Food Fight and I don't think he wants that to be his swan song so he'd probably get back out for it.

18:38.800 --> 18:47.760
It's really uncomfortable when there's like a bikini car wash super sexy teen montage and then all of a sudden Sean Connery is there and he's like, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

18:47.760 --> 18:48.560
Nice.

18:48.560 --> 18:49.200
Look at it.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.120
I can both shake it and stir it.

18:51.120 --> 18:52.000
Watch it spin.

18:53.360 --> 18:55.040
I mean my boat.

18:55.040 --> 18:55.920
Look at my boat.

18:55.920 --> 19:00.160
I possess jam because jelly doesn't shake like this, I think.

19:00.160 --> 19:02.720
Science has proven that jelly doesn't shake like that.

19:02.720 --> 19:06.640
Do you like how my boat fills out these jean cut off shorts?

19:07.200 --> 19:08.320
What are we saying?

19:08.320 --> 19:08.880
His boat.

19:10.960 --> 19:16.960
Is the bar exam something you can only take a certain amount of times and like if you fail a third time, you're done?

19:17.520 --> 19:22.640
I think it costs like $25,000 to take so I'm sure there's somebody who's like, oh another stab at it, huh?

19:22.640 --> 19:23.360
Yeah, bring it on.

19:24.720 --> 19:33.680
Because at a certain point, like if you fail it, and I'm not saying that she should give up or anything or anyone should give up, but how many times do you fail something like that before you're like, you know what, maybe.

19:34.320 --> 19:37.120
Like this isn't my scene.

19:37.120 --> 19:38.240
Well, what are you supposed to do?

19:38.240 --> 19:39.680
You've already gone to law school, Travis.

19:40.400 --> 19:41.680
You're a lawyer now.

19:41.680 --> 19:45.440
Maybe go to where whoever failed her and just be like, I object.

19:45.440 --> 19:50.880
And then quoted them some laws that they didn't know about that makes your friend pass the test.

19:51.440 --> 19:57.280
If we can get that guy approved officially as Santa Claus in Miracle on 34th Street, I think we can swing this.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.000
Yeah, probably.

19:58.000 --> 20:07.280
Oh yeah, just hand the judge a dollar and but on it you've written, please make my friend pass the bar exam and he's like, well, it's right there in black and white on the dollar.

20:07.280 --> 20:08.160
I'll allow it.

20:08.160 --> 20:08.720
I'll allow it.

20:08.720 --> 20:09.600
And then everybody cheers.

20:09.600 --> 20:16.800
Isn't it funny how if you give a judge $1 bill, it's moving and if you give him $25,000 bills, it's a federal crime.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.080
I don't understand.

20:18.080 --> 20:19.760
I don't understand the logistics.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.440
Come on, Obama.

20:21.440 --> 20:31.360
I mean, it's with this suggestion, it's one I haven't given in a while, but why don't you tell her to pack her bags and move away and go to a state where the bar exam is super duper easy.

20:31.360 --> 20:35.760
I'm saying maybe a Florida, probably a little bit easier to pass it down there.

20:35.760 --> 20:37.680
I'm saying maybe definitely a Missouri.

20:38.240 --> 20:39.440
Oh, that's an easy bar.

20:39.440 --> 20:39.920
Maybe Montana.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.680
I think there's only 20 people there.

20:41.680 --> 20:44.400
Yeah, Montana, there's like one law and it's don't kill.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.720
And so that was pretty easy.

20:46.720 --> 20:48.640
It's pretty easy to enforce it in Montana.

20:48.640 --> 20:52.480
Just get up there, write don't kill on a sheet of paper, hand it to the nearest judge.

20:52.480 --> 20:53.360
Boom, bang, bang.

20:53.360 --> 20:53.840
You're a lawyer.

20:53.840 --> 20:55.200
Do you know why they call it the bar exam?

20:55.200 --> 20:57.520
Beat the last state lawyer in a fist fight.

20:57.520 --> 20:58.080
Uh-huh.

20:58.080 --> 21:03.760
You know why they call it a bar exam is because there's a bar you have to clear and that bar is going to be at a different height from state to state.

21:03.760 --> 21:05.120
If you're in New York, fuck that.

21:05.120 --> 21:06.720
They got billions of laws up there.

21:06.720 --> 21:08.400
Montana, one law, no killing.

21:11.040 --> 21:11.840
You guys want a Yahoo?

21:12.880 --> 21:13.520
Yes, please.

21:13.520 --> 21:21.200
Uh, this Yahoo was sent in by level 900 Yadru Answers Druid Drew Davenport.

21:21.840 --> 21:22.880
Stumbled through that one.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.400
My apologies, Drew Davenport.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.960
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ronkey who asks.

21:28.240 --> 21:30.320
That's a great name, Ronkey.

21:31.200 --> 21:35.280
Ronkey asks, how do I make myself have a sex dream?

21:37.200 --> 21:39.440
I love having sex dreams.

21:39.440 --> 21:42.480
No, I think they are better than the real thing.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.240
But they happen so rarely.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.240
I want to have a sex dream every night.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.840
How do I force myself to do this?

21:51.520 --> 21:57.200
You know, but if you have a sex dream every night, you'll start to really look forward to the dreams where like your teeth just fall out.

21:57.200 --> 21:59.600
After your teeth fall out, do you do some weird oral stuff?

22:00.960 --> 22:04.160
I hope that's in the question and not coming from my baby brother's mouth.

22:04.160 --> 22:04.560
Wait a minute.

22:04.560 --> 22:05.120
Yeah, sorry.

22:05.120 --> 22:06.000
That came from the internet.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
Couldn't every weird dream just be a prelude to...

22:10.000 --> 22:11.760
Okay, here's what I'm saying.

22:11.760 --> 22:13.840
You know all the classic dreams, right?

22:14.400 --> 22:15.440
Maybe they are just...

22:15.440 --> 22:20.640
If we let them play out, maybe they're preludes to sex dreams.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.720
Okay, so all your teeth fall out.

22:22.720 --> 22:24.080
Amazing oral action.

22:25.680 --> 22:31.120
You've got the dream where you're naked on stage at your school auditorium.

22:31.120 --> 22:31.920
That's obvious.

22:31.920 --> 22:35.760
I see an orgy coming, you know?

22:35.760 --> 22:36.560
No, you got it the first time.

22:36.560 --> 22:38.000
Yeah, was it right the first time?

22:38.000 --> 22:39.280
I see a Ronkey coming.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.360
I see the black suits coming.

22:43.600 --> 22:44.400
Men in black.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.720
What about being chased through an abandoned amusement park?

22:46.720 --> 22:47.360
That's mine.

22:47.360 --> 22:49.840
It happens, I don't know, three times a week.

22:50.480 --> 22:55.920
Yeah, and then you stop at a roller coaster and the thing is chasing you is gone, and then you fuck that roller coaster.

22:55.920 --> 22:56.240
Okay.

22:56.240 --> 22:56.560
Go for it.

22:56.560 --> 23:01.920
Or you fuck a cotton candy machine, and there it is.

23:01.920 --> 23:03.680
We've all thought about it, and it's debunked.

23:03.680 --> 23:06.880
What if I fuck the cotton candy machine and the roller coaster gets jealous?

23:07.760 --> 23:08.720
That's a good point.

23:08.720 --> 23:12.080
Wow, you know, the dream where you're flying?

23:12.720 --> 23:18.480
Good news, somebody's about to be touched by an angel in a sexual way.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.000
In the bathing suit area.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.360
Been a while since I've seen that show.

23:21.360 --> 23:27.920
I do not think that there's a lot of flying, and there's very little lovemaking, if memory serves.

23:27.920 --> 23:34.000
I don't think Della Reese is like airborne, just like wailing on a guy.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.840
Just cruising around looking for flesh and meat.

23:37.840 --> 23:39.200
Looking for cloud peen.

23:41.840 --> 23:43.280
Looking for sky boats.

23:46.160 --> 23:48.880
Look at the boat on that one down on the ground, honey child.

23:48.880 --> 23:50.480
I'm gonna go down there and swoop it.

23:50.480 --> 23:53.120
I'm gonna swoop that boat.

23:53.120 --> 23:53.840
Swoop that boat.

23:53.840 --> 23:58.080
My husband was just abducted, was just sexually abducted by Della Reese.

23:59.120 --> 24:00.000
Again.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.040
Again.

24:01.040 --> 24:01.760
God damn it.

24:01.760 --> 24:04.160
When will the cops do something about this?

24:04.160 --> 24:04.800
What are you gonna do?

24:04.800 --> 24:05.440
Bust an angel?

24:05.440 --> 24:06.080
You can't.

24:06.080 --> 24:07.360
Busted by an angel.

24:11.680 --> 24:13.280
How do you make yourself have a sex dream, though?

24:13.840 --> 24:16.240
Just stay asleep longer, Justin, is what you're suggesting, right?

24:16.240 --> 24:18.400
When you feel yourself waking up, you edge it.

24:18.400 --> 24:24.480
You hang in there longer, and then the sex will start.

24:24.480 --> 24:25.200
You just gotta wait.

24:25.200 --> 24:26.480
You gotta wait for it.

24:26.480 --> 24:33.120
Can you also not just do a little, oh, what's the thing where you're doing conscious dream it,

24:33.120 --> 24:35.040
where you're in control of it?

24:35.040 --> 24:37.040
And you can be like, oh, I see where this is going.

24:37.040 --> 24:40.960
And then you just kind of self-edit and jump forward 20 minutes in the dream

24:40.960 --> 24:42.800
to when the sex is going on.

24:42.800 --> 24:47.760
You're talking about time traveling inside your own dreamosphere to get to the good part.

24:47.760 --> 24:53.680
You're talking about a fucking, like, Mr. Skin dream edit is what you're suggesting.

24:53.680 --> 24:53.920
Yeah.

24:54.720 --> 24:56.400
This is boring exposition.

24:57.200 --> 25:01.760
I want to see some dicks, and I want to see some butts, and I want to see all of it.

25:01.760 --> 25:02.720
I want to see some boats.

25:03.520 --> 25:08.320
I want to see some docks and some boats, if you know what I mean.

25:09.360 --> 25:10.160
I think you do.

25:10.160 --> 25:21.520
Yeah, I love skipping the good parts, and that's why I want to go straight to the money.

25:25.520 --> 25:27.760
Want to tell you folks about Pro Flowers.

25:28.880 --> 25:34.320
They are a service that is going to take care of you for Mother's Day.

25:34.320 --> 25:40.160
I actually got a beautiful package of Pro Flowers flowers in the mail.

25:40.160 --> 25:41.200
They were looking good.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.000
Lovely vase.

25:42.000 --> 25:42.640
Really nice.

25:43.600 --> 25:47.680
Translucent pink and some beautiful flowers and a box of candies.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.440
These are good deals.

25:51.440 --> 25:58.240
You're going to be able to get 100 blooms with a free glass vase for just $19.99.

25:58.240 --> 26:03.040
You can make the day extra special by upgrading to a premium vase and chocolates for just

26:03.040 --> 26:04.880
$9.99 more.

26:04.880 --> 26:09.120
You got to go to proflowers.com, and you're going to use the code MYBROTHER.

26:10.400 --> 26:13.760
Teresa and I did this for her mom last year for last Mother's Day.

26:13.760 --> 26:19.520
We used Pro Flowers and sent her the 100 blooms and the chocolates, and she really loved them.

26:19.520 --> 26:20.960
They lasted a long time.

26:21.600 --> 26:23.200
These flowers stay fresh.

26:23.200 --> 26:26.480
They cut them real fresh, and they put them out before they've bloomed.

26:26.480 --> 26:28.960
They're still fresh for two or three weeks after that.

26:30.160 --> 26:31.760
A hundred is a lot of flowers.

26:31.760 --> 26:34.320
They're going to see how many flowers they're getting, and they're going to fucking barf.

26:34.880 --> 26:38.480
If you want to put some in your teeth and tango around like in the movies,

26:38.480 --> 26:39.360
you can do it a hundred times.

26:39.360 --> 26:40.400
Do it a hundred times.

26:40.400 --> 26:43.360
You can do it 20 times before you'd even fucking notice.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.400
You're going to get sick of tangoing.

26:46.400 --> 26:48.160
That's the Pro Flowers guarantee.

26:48.160 --> 26:51.920
Go to proflowers.com, look for the blue microphone, click on that.

26:51.920 --> 26:54.400
It's in the top right corner of the website, and type in MYBROTHER.

26:55.440 --> 26:56.400
Go now.

26:56.400 --> 26:57.680
Take care of this right now.

26:57.680 --> 27:00.160
I also want to thank Nature Box for supporting the show this week.

27:00.160 --> 27:04.240
Nature Box's snacks are all made with zero artificial flavors, colors or sweeteners,

27:04.240 --> 27:07.680
zero grams trans fats, and no high fructose corn syrup.

27:07.680 --> 27:10.080
Get out of here, fructose.

27:10.080 --> 27:13.680
I don't even know what you are, but you sound like science, and I don't trust science.

27:14.320 --> 27:18.480
If you grab, you can go to Nature Box, and you can grab sriracha roasted cashews,

27:18.480 --> 27:22.800
white truffle popcorn, and peanut butter nom noms, or maybe some Big Island pineapple,

27:22.800 --> 27:27.760
or some barbecue kettle kernels, or some Greek blueberry Greek yogurt pretzels.

27:27.760 --> 27:30.480
I've got these snacks stuck in my head like a beautiful song.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.920
I really like the lemon tea biscuits.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.520
They're real buttery.

27:35.520 --> 27:36.000
I love them.

27:36.720 --> 27:40.560
The Asiago cheese crisps are the greatest snack I've ever had in my entire life,

27:40.560 --> 27:44.160
and that is no smoke up your butts on your boats.

27:44.160 --> 27:46.560
If you want some smoked snacks, I'm sure they got those too.

27:46.560 --> 27:47.760
Just go to naturebox.com.

27:47.760 --> 27:49.680
Check out their selection of vape juices.

27:51.760 --> 27:55.280
Go to naturebox.com slash MYBROTHER, and you can get a free trial box

27:55.280 --> 27:58.960
of their favorite snacks, and then you can pick up some of your own.

27:58.960 --> 28:03.360
I cannot tell you how many listeners have picked up Nature Box, gotten on board,

28:03.360 --> 28:05.360
and have absolutely adored it.

28:05.360 --> 28:09.360
So go to naturebox.com slash MYBROTHER right now, and get a free trial of your favorite snacks.

28:10.160 --> 28:13.040
I got a message for Sarah, and it's from Jesse, who says,

28:13.040 --> 28:18.320
Sarah! Sarah! Hey Sarah! Happy birthday!

28:18.320 --> 28:20.160
You are the love of my life.

28:20.160 --> 28:22.160
You make every day better than the last.

28:22.160 --> 28:26.080
Your beauty rivals even the most glorious stallion.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.480
But let's be real, no one is winning that contest.

28:29.920 --> 28:31.680
I hope you had a wonderful day.

28:31.680 --> 28:34.880
You're my favorite person, and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.

28:34.880 --> 28:35.760
Love, Jesse.

28:35.760 --> 28:36.400
That's the sweetest and goddamn-

28:36.400 --> 28:39.520
Also, I sit three seats behind you in math class.

28:39.520 --> 28:44.480
We've overspoken, but you are the virginal canvas on which I shall paint my masterpiece.

28:46.240 --> 28:49.600
One day our souls shall join together forever and eternity.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.600
Got a message from Mark here from Minna.

28:51.600 --> 28:55.360
Happy birthday, Sarah. That was horrifying.

28:55.360 --> 28:59.040
And you sound like a really great person, but not as great as a horse,

28:59.040 --> 29:01.040
which Jesse will be the first person to admit.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.960
Got a message from Mark from Minna.

29:03.600 --> 29:05.280
Says, happy birthday, buddy.

29:05.280 --> 29:08.000
And then she said, I'm sorry that Justin misread this,

29:08.000 --> 29:10.400
and it should say happy anniversary, buddy.

29:10.400 --> 29:11.680
Sorry that he's such a dullard.

29:11.680 --> 29:12.560
What did you say?

29:12.560 --> 29:13.760
I said birthday.

29:13.760 --> 29:18.880
Living with you has been amazing, even if we still can't wake up in the morning.

29:18.880 --> 29:19.840
So there you go.

29:19.840 --> 29:20.400
What?

29:20.400 --> 29:22.400
Some people don't like to get up in the mornings, Travis.

29:22.400 --> 29:25.040
Are they trapped under some kind of, like, spell?

29:25.040 --> 29:27.200
A bookcase fell on them in the sleeping times.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.520
They could send one email, and this is the one.

29:30.240 --> 29:33.040
Thank you for supporting me through my dumb PhD studies.

29:33.040 --> 29:34.800
I couldn't have gotten this far without you.

29:34.800 --> 29:37.600
I'm incredibly excited to eat delicious food, travel the world,

29:37.600 --> 29:39.600
and be disgustingly happy with you.

29:39.600 --> 29:41.760
Justin, something in the taco voice.

29:41.760 --> 29:43.280
I'm not aware of a taco.

29:43.280 --> 29:46.720
That's a different brand in our cross-media empire.

29:48.800 --> 29:49.680
Give him a piece of it.

29:49.680 --> 29:50.640
It'll be cross-promotion.

29:50.640 --> 29:51.760
Cross-promotion, okay.

29:51.760 --> 29:54.560
I hope you had a fantastic anniversary, darling.

29:55.600 --> 29:57.040
That sounded kind of weird.

29:57.040 --> 29:59.440
Yeah, well, it's hard to get into if I'm not in character.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.840
It takes 15 minutes just to get there.

30:02.640 --> 30:03.360
Edit that out.

30:05.200 --> 30:06.480
Oh, hey there, everybody.

30:06.480 --> 30:09.200
I'm Guy Branum, and welcome to Pop Rocket,

30:09.200 --> 30:13.120
a new weekly show picking over the pop culture we all love to love.

30:13.120 --> 30:16.800
With me to talk TV, film, music, and anything else entertaining

30:16.800 --> 30:21.440
are journalist Margaret Wappler, academic writer and DJ Oliver Wang,

30:21.440 --> 30:25.120
digital strategist Wyndham Mitchell, and comedian Santina Muha.

30:25.120 --> 30:27.440
It's an intellectual and incredibly snark-filled discussion

30:27.440 --> 30:30.560
about pop culture by five cranky Hollywood 30-somethings.

30:30.560 --> 30:33.600
No name-calling, no rudeness, just straight talk and a lot of role play.

30:33.600 --> 30:35.200
I'm only 30-something for another year.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.080
Me too.

30:36.080 --> 30:38.640
And I don't tell anybody I'm 30-something.

30:39.600 --> 30:42.720
Pop Rocket comes out every week from MaximumFun.org.

30:42.720 --> 30:47.680
I work at Arby's.

30:48.320 --> 30:48.880
Oh, shit.

30:51.600 --> 30:52.800
I'm not laughing at you.

30:52.800 --> 30:55.200
I'm laughing because now I'm uncomfortable.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.560
Arby's is the-

30:56.560 --> 30:58.400
Experiment's only natural defense.

30:58.400 --> 31:01.520
Arby's is the official fast food partner of my brother and me.

31:01.520 --> 31:02.240
As everybody knows,

31:02.240 --> 31:05.840
we've been working together to create great jokes for many years.

31:05.840 --> 31:07.280
At Arby's expense.

31:07.280 --> 31:08.560
Well, it's more of a-

31:08.560 --> 31:10.480
I think of it as a collaboration.

31:10.480 --> 31:13.920
Arby's keeps me at Arby's and we do Arby's material.

31:13.920 --> 31:15.280
I think Arby's is great.

31:17.040 --> 31:19.360
And I really like the Big Montana.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.720
You're trying to whitewash your Arby's history right now,

31:22.720 --> 31:23.760
and I'm not gonna let you.

31:24.720 --> 31:25.040
Okay.

31:25.680 --> 31:30.080
You've been heinous to Arby's and the people who are employed by Mr. Arby.

31:30.080 --> 31:32.240
I've never said anything bad about Arby's employees.

31:32.240 --> 31:36.800
I think the real solidly are folks who do a great job working at that restaurant.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.880
And I frequent Arby's.

31:38.880 --> 31:40.720
I'm a frequent customer there.

31:40.720 --> 31:42.640
Really into the jalapeno hash browns.

31:42.640 --> 31:43.280
Or, sorry.

31:43.280 --> 31:47.840
Justin, just blink twice if there's an Arby's person holding a gun to you right now.

31:47.840 --> 31:48.720
Hash puppies.

31:48.720 --> 31:49.360
Uh, okay.

31:49.360 --> 31:50.320
I work at Arby's.

31:51.760 --> 31:56.480
Part of my job is to visit guests in the lobby and make sure everything is to their satisfaction.

31:56.480 --> 31:57.040
You apparently-

31:57.040 --> 31:57.520
What?

31:57.520 --> 31:59.360
This is apparently a pilot program.

31:59.360 --> 32:03.200
I'm assuming that experience has never happened to me.

32:03.200 --> 32:04.480
Oh la dee dah.

32:05.360 --> 32:07.280
Welcome to our bondos.

32:07.280 --> 32:11.120
Cafe Arbando.

32:12.320 --> 32:15.360
Often there are a lot of occupied tables near each other,

32:15.360 --> 32:17.120
and it can get a little repetitive and awkward to say,

32:17.120 --> 32:18.400
hey, how's it going?

32:18.400 --> 32:20.080
Over and over to every guest.

32:20.080 --> 32:23.920
Do you have any tips on how to change it up and be less awkwardly repetitive with my customers?

32:23.920 --> 32:25.280
That's from muddled in management.

32:26.160 --> 32:28.640
If I was doing this, my first thing that I would say is,

32:28.640 --> 32:30.400
hey, you're eating inside an Arby's.

32:30.400 --> 32:31.120
Are you okay?

32:32.960 --> 32:33.920
Is everything going-

32:33.920 --> 32:34.800
How are you doing?

32:34.800 --> 32:36.720
No, like, but really, how are you doing?

32:36.720 --> 32:37.600
How are you doing?

32:37.600 --> 32:39.120
Hey, it's gonna get better than this.

32:40.080 --> 32:40.480
Certainly.

32:40.480 --> 32:41.120
Are you cool?

32:41.760 --> 32:46.240
Statistically speaking, it's gonna get better than this.

32:46.240 --> 32:49.200
I don't understand why you have to go from table to table, person to person,

32:49.200 --> 32:52.080
asking each and every person the same thing when you could just yell to the room,

32:52.080 --> 32:53.280
how's everyone doing?

32:53.280 --> 32:55.600
And they all respond in unison, pretty bad.

32:57.360 --> 33:00.480
By a round of applause, I'm greasy on your fingers.

33:02.400 --> 33:04.560
Who here is a sloppy beef boy?

33:04.560 --> 33:07.040
All of you.

33:07.040 --> 33:09.600
I feel like I'm not, I wanna be clear,

33:09.600 --> 33:13.200
I'm not saying anything negative about people who would eat Arby's food.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.800
I am among those people.

33:15.520 --> 33:18.400
I'm questioning the people who look at Arby's and think,

33:18.400 --> 33:19.360
I gotta get in there.

33:21.120 --> 33:22.960
I hope there's an available table.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.000
I hope there's no way-

33:24.000 --> 33:25.520
I hope there's a table at Arby's.

33:25.520 --> 33:26.880
Babe, did you make a reservation?

33:27.600 --> 33:29.280
At Cafe Arbando's?

33:30.160 --> 33:33.200
Do you guys remember, actually remember the last time that you ate

33:33.200 --> 33:35.280
physically inside a fast food restaurant?

33:36.080 --> 33:38.160
Do you remember the last time you actually sat down and did that?

33:38.160 --> 33:41.200
Has it been in your, like, adult life?

33:41.200 --> 33:42.640
I mean, on a road trip, probably.

33:44.560 --> 33:47.840
Like, stop at the McDonald's, though, and eat inside the McDonald's?

33:48.560 --> 33:49.760
I mean, sometimes it's dope.

33:49.760 --> 33:51.360
Sometimes they got Wi-Fi.

33:51.360 --> 33:54.400
Sometimes a man comes to you and says,

33:54.400 --> 33:57.920
Griffin, I just wanna check in, make sure you're doing okay.

33:57.920 --> 33:59.600
Have you experienced a free Wi-Fi?

33:59.600 --> 34:01.040
I say, yes, I have.

34:01.040 --> 34:03.520
And he's like, here, have a pumpkin pie.

34:03.520 --> 34:04.560
I'm like, what the fuck?

34:04.560 --> 34:05.280
It's April.

34:06.480 --> 34:09.280
I've actually had that experience having to wheeze the Wi-Fi off

34:09.280 --> 34:11.680
of my local Fazoli's, which is amazing,

34:11.680 --> 34:13.760
because they'll keep bringing those breadsticks.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.240
They change shifts pretty frequently.

34:16.240 --> 34:18.080
They don't know how long you've been there.

34:18.080 --> 34:20.720
Because people keep biting their fingers

34:20.720 --> 34:22.960
as they hold out breadsticks to them.

34:22.960 --> 34:25.120
Excuse me, sir, would you like a free-

34:25.120 --> 34:26.880
Oh, God, you got the tip of my thumb.

34:26.880 --> 34:27.380
Oh, God.

34:27.380 --> 34:30.260
The turnover rate of Fazoli's is enormous,

34:30.260 --> 34:32.660
and the turnover rate on Fazoli's employees' hands

34:32.660 --> 34:33.620
is even even bigger.

34:33.620 --> 34:35.460
My local Fazoli's has a new policy,

34:35.460 --> 34:36.740
where they don't have someone going around

34:36.740 --> 34:37.780
with a breadstick basket.

34:37.780 --> 34:41.780
You have to go to the counter, hands empty,

34:41.780 --> 34:44.020
pockets out turned, and just say,

34:44.020 --> 34:46.820
hi, I'm a breadstick boy, and I am-

34:46.820 --> 34:48.100
What's this, please?

34:48.100 --> 34:49.860
What's this, please?

34:51.060 --> 34:52.420
Me hungy, I guess.

34:53.620 --> 34:55.620
I'm sorry, I don't mean to bother you.

34:55.620 --> 34:58.100
You're clearly working very hard behind the counter.

34:58.100 --> 35:00.180
I just wanted to say, me hungy.

35:01.940 --> 35:02.420
Peas.

35:02.420 --> 35:02.980
Me hungy.

35:04.260 --> 35:05.540
I think that the opportunity

35:05.540 --> 35:08.020
that Question Master has here is great,

35:08.020 --> 35:09.700
because I think this is the kind of scenario

35:09.700 --> 35:12.340
where customers enjoy a little bit of levity.

35:12.900 --> 35:14.900
They realize the situation's kind of weird

35:14.900 --> 35:17.060
to have the management of Arby's be like,

35:17.620 --> 35:19.860
so you get to come up with different phrases,

35:19.860 --> 35:21.620
and the one that popped into my head is,

35:21.620 --> 35:25.700
how are you enjoying your sandwich journey?

35:25.700 --> 35:27.300
That's a mouthful, though.

35:27.300 --> 35:28.660
I see you're on a beef path.

35:28.660 --> 35:41.620
I see you got an extra large diet, Dr. Pepper.

35:41.620 --> 35:44.420
He's my favorite companion on the beef path, too.

35:44.420 --> 35:47.060
You got yourself a little beef sherpa, I see.

35:47.060 --> 35:50.900
Can I offer you any words of encouragement or experience?

35:50.900 --> 35:54.180
Or guidance, perhaps, on your beef journey?

35:54.180 --> 35:56.580
Oh, man, just a few bites left.

35:56.580 --> 35:57.780
You're almost through this,

35:57.780 --> 35:59.620
and then you won't have to be in an Arby's anymore.

35:59.620 --> 36:03.220
You can go home, see your wife and kids,

36:03.220 --> 36:05.620
really think about the choices you've made with your life.

36:05.620 --> 36:06.980
Maybe tomorrow's a new day.

36:08.180 --> 36:09.380
You're almost through this.

36:10.900 --> 36:12.660
Maybe this is the turning point.

36:12.660 --> 36:13.780
You can do this.

36:13.780 --> 36:15.380
I see you're eating our meat stack,

36:15.380 --> 36:16.740
which is a real thing.

36:16.740 --> 36:17.380
What is it called?

36:17.380 --> 36:18.420
Tower of Meat?

36:18.420 --> 36:19.860
They have a thing that's like the-

36:19.860 --> 36:23.620
I've been paying my rent every day at the Tower of Meat.

36:25.860 --> 36:27.380
I think they call it a ham column.

36:27.380 --> 36:30.900
I have worked a lot of different places,

36:30.900 --> 36:33.940
and take it from me, I've tried it both ways.

36:33.940 --> 36:37.380
You will be immeasurably happier at any job you do

36:37.380 --> 36:39.460
if you decide once you walk in those doors

36:40.580 --> 36:43.620
that you are completely sold out

36:43.620 --> 36:48.180
and 100% a huge booster of whatever business you work at.

36:48.180 --> 36:53.460
Nothing puts people, one, at ease more,

36:54.340 --> 36:56.580
and two, sort of like is fascinating

36:56.580 --> 36:59.060
than a person who's like deep into it.

36:59.060 --> 37:02.340
What I'm saying to you is go get to Wikipedia,

37:03.460 --> 37:05.140
read up on some Arby's history.

37:05.780 --> 37:07.300
Are you enjoying that sandwich?

37:07.300 --> 37:10.500
Do you know on this day in 1972,

37:10.500 --> 37:14.340
that's exactly when Jebediah Arby's in 1874

37:14.340 --> 37:18.260
founded the first Arby's in a dirty, unused garbage pit.

37:19.220 --> 37:20.820
He created that sandwich.

37:21.380 --> 37:23.220
Originally it was buffalo beef.

37:23.220 --> 37:24.420
Not a lot of people know that.

37:24.420 --> 37:25.380
Roast buffalo.

37:25.380 --> 37:26.660
Okay, enjoy your sandwich.

37:27.860 --> 37:28.420
I love that.

37:28.420 --> 37:31.300
I think it's a much more fun way to go through your work day

37:31.300 --> 37:34.900
if you decide that you love the place that you work at.

37:35.460 --> 37:38.740
A lot of people in jobs that they don't consider

37:38.740 --> 37:41.300
to be their full-time career for their life

37:41.300 --> 37:45.060
will kind of have a sort of antagonistic relationship

37:45.060 --> 37:45.940
with the places they work.

37:45.940 --> 37:49.460
I'm saying if you decide to make the decision

37:49.460 --> 37:51.220
that you love the place you work at,

37:51.220 --> 37:54.340
it really does immeasurably improve your work day.

37:54.340 --> 37:56.820
When I worked at Best Buy, I was sold out.

37:57.460 --> 37:59.380
Store 573 on top.

37:59.380 --> 38:00.100
That was me.

38:00.100 --> 38:02.660
I was pushing the Best Buy brand in a major way.

38:02.660 --> 38:05.460
So early 20s Justin's philosophy was

38:05.460 --> 38:06.660
don't chase your dreams,

38:07.380 --> 38:09.700
wait for just make your dreams come to you.

38:09.700 --> 38:11.220
It's a very Buddhist way of looking at

38:11.220 --> 38:12.740
minimum wage employment, Griffin.

38:12.740 --> 38:15.300
I am here at Best Buy today,

38:15.300 --> 38:17.060
and today I will love being at Best Buy.

38:17.860 --> 38:18.180
Man, how long did that-

38:18.180 --> 38:19.380
The best of the situation.

38:20.100 --> 38:24.500
Have you ever told the story of when that fire died?

38:25.060 --> 38:27.220
That fire inside you for the Best Buy brand.

38:28.100 --> 38:28.820
Let's see.

38:28.820 --> 38:31.460
Because nothing gold can fucking stay, pony boy.

38:31.460 --> 38:33.860
Every one of these relationships

38:33.860 --> 38:35.700
with a big business you've ever been in

38:35.700 --> 38:38.180
ended with a, we'll say, turmoil.

38:38.180 --> 38:42.420
Well, yeah, at Blockbuster I was fired

38:42.420 --> 38:43.540
for stealing a copy of Fight Club,

38:43.540 --> 38:45.220
which seemed like a very Tyler Durden thing to do.

38:46.260 --> 38:46.740
Even though you stole many-

38:46.740 --> 38:48.340
They said that in the exit interview.

38:48.340 --> 38:48.740
Yeah.

38:48.740 --> 38:50.980
You stole many other VHS cassettes,

38:50.980 --> 38:52.580
which I will not announce on the show

38:52.580 --> 38:54.260
for fear of embarrassing you, Showgirls.

38:56.100 --> 38:58.260
Now, hey, I had my friend Tommy Red

38:58.260 --> 38:59.540
tape Showgirls off HBO

38:59.540 --> 39:00.900
because we were on vacation when it ran.

39:01.780 --> 39:03.540
You just, oh, and you just stole

39:03.540 --> 39:05.620
a Blockbuster video box and label

39:05.620 --> 39:06.980
for it to make it look official.

39:06.980 --> 39:08.900
Well, I needed the extended version later,

39:08.900 --> 39:09.300
but anyway-

39:09.300 --> 39:10.500
For sure.

39:10.500 --> 39:13.620
Best Buy, I, let's see, how do I,

39:13.620 --> 39:16.420
oh, I was not moving at a pace

39:16.420 --> 39:18.340
that was acceptable to the managers

39:18.340 --> 39:19.300
around the show floor

39:20.100 --> 39:21.380
when they wanted me to go around and hand out-

39:21.380 --> 39:22.900
The cracks were beginning to show.

39:22.900 --> 39:24.100
The cracks were beginning to show.

39:24.100 --> 39:25.620
And they said, when you're on that show floor,

39:25.620 --> 39:27.380
you need to move like your ass is on fire.

39:27.940 --> 39:30.020
And then I said, okay.

39:30.020 --> 39:32.020
And I moved like my ass is on fire

39:32.020 --> 39:32.900
right out the door.

39:32.900 --> 39:37.700
No notice at Best Buy, just kind of left.

39:37.700 --> 39:39.620
Oh, it's, it's harder if you,

39:39.620 --> 39:41.540
if you prolong it, it's,

39:41.540 --> 39:42.820
when it's real love,

39:42.820 --> 39:44.580
if you prolong the, the split,

39:44.580 --> 39:45.220
oh, it just-

39:45.220 --> 39:46.340
They didn't know what they had

39:46.340 --> 39:47.380
in a young Justin Macro.

39:47.380 --> 39:48.900
They didn't know that I would someday

39:48.900 --> 39:50.580
go on to invent podcasting.

39:50.580 --> 39:51.060
They didn't know that.

39:51.060 --> 39:51.620
Yeah, sure.

39:53.220 --> 39:53.860
God love them.

39:55.700 --> 39:56.500
You guys want a Yahoo?

39:57.300 --> 39:57.800
Yes.

39:58.980 --> 40:01.060
This Yahoo was sent in by Zoe Kinski.

40:01.060 --> 40:03.540
Thank you, Zoe. It's by Yahoo Answers user.

40:04.500 --> 40:05.460
It's not loading.

40:06.340 --> 40:07.940
Let me refresh.

40:07.940 --> 40:09.620
It's still not loading.

40:09.620 --> 40:10.180
Pretty cool website.

40:10.180 --> 40:11.060
Make up a name, it doesn't matter.

40:12.420 --> 40:13.220
Germs.

40:16.180 --> 40:16.680
Germs.

40:17.140 --> 40:19.620
Germs asks, butt emergency.

40:20.340 --> 40:22.740
Anyone who knows how to make a butt look hot,

40:22.740 --> 40:23.540
answer this.

40:23.540 --> 40:24.820
Serious answers only.

40:25.460 --> 40:27.220
My senior, my senior year starts-

40:27.220 --> 40:28.900
Gonna have to go out and paint the deck.

40:28.900 --> 40:30.580
Get a fresh coat of paint on the starboard

40:30.580 --> 40:31.380
and port sides.

40:32.100 --> 40:34.180
My senior year starts in less than a week,

40:34.180 --> 40:35.860
and since I haven't worked out for a while,

40:35.860 --> 40:37.780
my butt is starting to look flat.

40:37.780 --> 40:39.540
Does anyone know any butt lifting

40:39.540 --> 40:40.740
and firming exercises

40:40.740 --> 40:42.100
or anything around those lines?

40:42.820 --> 40:43.780
For one week.

40:44.420 --> 40:45.380
Power blast it.

40:47.220 --> 40:48.580
I was just about to say maybe

40:48.580 --> 40:50.580
some kind of alternative means,

40:51.220 --> 40:52.420
like a duct tape

40:52.420 --> 40:54.740
or perhaps some sort of superglare.

40:55.380 --> 40:56.020
How would that-

40:56.020 --> 40:57.540
You can't just say shit, Travis.

40:57.540 --> 40:59.540
That's my new motto for the show, by the way.

40:59.540 --> 41:01.380
You can't just say shit

41:01.380 --> 41:03.380
and almost always specifically Travis.

41:03.940 --> 41:05.060
You gotta start the tape

41:05.060 --> 41:06.500
at the bottom of the butt cheek, right?

41:06.500 --> 41:07.540
And then kind of lift

41:07.540 --> 41:09.700
and then pull the end of the tape

41:09.700 --> 41:10.580
to your shoulder.

41:11.460 --> 41:14.580
And it's kind of like suspenders for your butt, right?

41:14.580 --> 41:16.420
And that lifts it up a little bit.

41:16.420 --> 41:18.340
Or you just wrap each butt cheek

41:18.340 --> 41:20.580
in some tape to kind of fill it out a little bit.

41:20.580 --> 41:22.500
Now it's going to be uncomfortable,

41:22.500 --> 41:24.660
but we all know that beauty is pain.

41:24.660 --> 41:26.180
Am I right, everyone?

41:26.180 --> 41:27.460
Nothing tastes as good

41:27.460 --> 41:29.860
as butt suspenders feel.

41:29.860 --> 41:30.420
Wait, what?

41:32.580 --> 41:34.580
Butt suspenders one is sweeter

41:34.580 --> 41:36.180
than butt suspenders earned.

41:37.540 --> 41:39.780
Now, Travis, does it lift and separate the butt?

41:39.780 --> 41:42.180
Because that seems to be a big thing for fashion.

41:42.180 --> 41:44.340
Well, it depends on which way you want to go, Justin,

41:44.340 --> 41:45.140
because you could always do

41:45.140 --> 41:47.220
a cross your back kind of scenario, right?

41:48.020 --> 41:48.660
Hot cross buns.

41:49.220 --> 41:51.060
Hot cross buns.

41:51.060 --> 41:51.780
Or you could do it

41:51.780 --> 41:53.620
where it pulls the butt together

41:53.620 --> 41:55.540
making it into one giant cheek,

41:55.540 --> 41:57.860
which isn't popular now,

41:57.860 --> 42:00.340
but I think that if you pay attention in 2016,

42:00.340 --> 42:01.860
we're going to see a big move

42:01.860 --> 42:03.620
towards just one big butt cheek.

42:03.620 --> 42:06.260
Is it just one party that this person's going to?

42:06.260 --> 42:07.140
Is that what's going on?

42:07.140 --> 42:08.420
It's their senior year of high school.

42:08.420 --> 42:09.300
Thanks for paying attention.

42:09.300 --> 42:10.260
The whole senior year?

42:10.260 --> 42:11.460
Just a graduation or?

42:12.260 --> 42:14.340
Their senior year starts in less than a week.

42:14.340 --> 42:15.380
Okay, see, I was going to say,

42:15.380 --> 42:16.500
if it's a prom-like event,

42:16.500 --> 42:18.180
what you can do is buy a new butt

42:18.180 --> 42:19.700
and just leave the tags on it.

42:19.700 --> 42:21.460
And then once you're done with it,

42:21.460 --> 42:22.260
you just return it.

42:22.260 --> 42:24.980
You just return it.

42:24.980 --> 42:25.860
But you got to be careful

42:25.860 --> 42:27.380
because if you spill anything on that butt,

42:27.380 --> 42:28.340
they won't take it back.

42:28.980 --> 42:29.460
Trust me.

42:30.500 --> 42:32.020
I'm looking for a more organic,

42:32.740 --> 42:34.260
healthy option,

42:34.260 --> 42:35.140
like I always am,

42:35.940 --> 42:38.660
for permanent butt perfection.

42:39.940 --> 42:41.060
So like an exercise,

42:41.060 --> 42:43.380
something to really confuse and explode my glutes.

42:45.060 --> 42:46.420
You know in Ace Ventura?

42:47.860 --> 42:49.220
You know that scene in Ace Ventura?

42:49.780 --> 42:51.060
Where he makes his butt talk?

42:51.060 --> 42:53.220
I bet that would be a pretty good workout.

42:53.220 --> 42:54.260
But you're going to have to be

42:54.260 --> 42:56.900
a lot more forceful than Mr. Kerry was.

42:56.900 --> 42:57.540
And the thing is,

42:57.540 --> 42:59.540
you're going to have to go on for a long time.

42:59.540 --> 43:00.260
You're going to have to do

43:00.260 --> 43:02.500
like a staged reading of Dune.

43:02.500 --> 43:05.780
Like the entire Dune series with your butt.

43:05.780 --> 43:07.300
You can't just be like,

43:07.300 --> 43:08.500
let me ask you a question.

43:08.500 --> 43:09.460
That's not going to do it.

43:09.460 --> 43:12.020
You got to start like from the beginning.

43:12.020 --> 43:12.580
Now Justin,

43:12.580 --> 43:14.260
does it have to be a staged reading?

43:14.260 --> 43:17.700
Does the sight of the crowd affect the results?

43:17.700 --> 43:20.740
Well, it's going to help give you the motivation,

43:20.740 --> 43:21.860
not to give up.

43:21.860 --> 43:26.260
And now a rare concert performance of Justin

43:26.260 --> 43:28.660
using his butt to read all of Dune.

43:28.660 --> 43:29.140
I will kill him.

43:29.140 --> 43:31.380
Not a drop of rain ever falls on a rack ass.

43:32.660 --> 43:33.620
But let me tell you,

43:33.620 --> 43:34.980
when I read the Liturgy of Fear,

43:34.980 --> 43:37.540
there's not a dry eye in the house with my butt.

43:42.100 --> 43:44.820
My girlfriend and I are embroiled in an apartment hunt.

43:45.380 --> 43:47.140
We found several that suit our needs,

43:47.140 --> 43:50.260
but just a couple of hundo out of our price range.

43:50.260 --> 43:52.900
She proposes we begin negating the leasing agents

43:53.700 --> 43:55.860
in an effort to make them want to lease to us.

43:55.860 --> 43:57.860
And this sounds like an interesting prospect to me.

43:57.860 --> 43:58.900
The question to you is,

43:59.540 --> 44:00.980
how would we go about this?

44:00.980 --> 44:03.540
Do we insult the apartment or the agent themselves?

44:07.060 --> 44:08.820
Is peacocking recommended?

44:08.820 --> 44:09.380
Thanks.

44:09.380 --> 44:12.180
That's from Randy for Rentals in Richmond.

44:12.180 --> 44:13.140
Oh man.

44:13.140 --> 44:14.020
We need to shut this down.

44:14.020 --> 44:16.260
A couple of things to unpack here.

44:17.220 --> 44:17.700
First off,

44:17.700 --> 44:21.220
everybody's, you know what?

44:21.220 --> 44:22.340
If you want negging,

44:22.340 --> 44:23.540
I have something for you.

44:23.540 --> 44:26.580
It's called like the world most of the time.

44:26.580 --> 44:28.340
Like don't neg people.

44:28.340 --> 44:29.140
We're all humans.

44:29.140 --> 44:30.900
We're all trying to get through this thing together.

44:30.900 --> 44:32.020
I don't think there's a context

44:32.020 --> 44:34.580
which I would ever neg a human being

44:34.580 --> 44:36.020
about their own situation

44:36.020 --> 44:41.300
that is wholly ineffective and cruel and terrible.

44:41.300 --> 44:43.140
RE peacocking.

44:43.140 --> 44:44.020
You can do that,

44:44.020 --> 44:45.380
but don't have an agenda.

44:46.020 --> 44:47.060
Just do it for you.

44:47.060 --> 44:49.220
I peacock for me all the time.

44:49.220 --> 44:50.340
By which I mean I actually put-

44:50.340 --> 44:51.380
I peacocked 24-7.

44:51.380 --> 44:54.020
I put rainbow feathers in my boat

44:54.020 --> 44:55.140
and I just walk around like that.

44:55.140 --> 44:56.420
If you're going apartment hunting,

44:56.420 --> 44:57.780
bring the peacock along.

44:57.780 --> 44:59.460
Hey, where can my peacock stay in here?

44:59.460 --> 45:00.980
Is this a peacock-friendly apartment?

45:02.420 --> 45:03.380
I doubled down

45:03.940 --> 45:06.340
and my fursona is that of a peacock.

45:06.980 --> 45:08.500
So I'm getting it left and right.

45:08.500 --> 45:09.620
Please don't tell my wife.

45:09.620 --> 45:12.260
My fursona is that of a peacock and I own a peacock.

45:12.260 --> 45:15.060
So I'm both a human-sized peacock and a regular peacock.

45:15.860 --> 45:16.180
Yes.

45:16.180 --> 45:17.700
J-Town, let me ask you a question.

45:17.700 --> 45:17.940
Yeah.

45:17.940 --> 45:19.700
You have bought two homes now, right?

45:19.700 --> 45:20.420
Yeah.

45:20.420 --> 45:21.220
And two peacocks.

45:21.860 --> 45:22.340
One per home.

45:23.860 --> 45:25.220
In movies and TV shows,

45:25.220 --> 45:27.620
they always show people like scheming to walk around

45:27.620 --> 45:27.940
and be like,

45:27.940 --> 45:30.340
oh, I don't know about this archway

45:30.340 --> 45:31.940
and I'm not really happy with the door.

45:31.940 --> 45:34.020
To try to get money knocked off?

45:34.020 --> 45:37.620
Is that a real thing that real people do in real life?

45:39.220 --> 45:39.700
What?

45:39.700 --> 45:41.860
The thing is when you're looking at houses,

45:41.860 --> 45:45.620
you're very rarely looking at it with the person selling it.

45:45.620 --> 45:46.580
So like your agent-

45:46.580 --> 45:47.380
That sucks.

45:47.380 --> 45:48.340
That's shitty.

45:48.340 --> 45:49.300
Boo to that.

45:49.300 --> 45:49.940
That sucks.

45:49.940 --> 45:51.220
You call that a bathroom?

45:52.100 --> 45:55.060
Uh, now, when we bought our new home,

45:55.060 --> 45:57.140
we bought it for sale by owner.

45:57.140 --> 45:58.500
So the owner showed us around the place.

45:58.500 --> 46:01.060
So I did punch a hole right in the guest room wall.

46:01.860 --> 46:02.340
How much do you-

46:02.340 --> 46:04.260
Look at how flimsily this is made.

46:05.060 --> 46:06.420
And you broke your hand.

46:06.420 --> 46:09.140
This window just breaks right away when I put my butt on it.

46:10.740 --> 46:12.260
I farted in every room of this house.

46:12.260 --> 46:14.100
How much of a discount are you willing to offer me?

46:14.100 --> 46:16.180
I'm just wondering if there's a scenario

46:16.180 --> 46:18.180
where you'd walk around with the real estate person

46:18.180 --> 46:20.340
being like, ugh, what the fuck is this?

46:20.340 --> 46:21.380
Look at this floor.

46:21.380 --> 46:22.100
Oh, gross.

46:22.660 --> 46:23.460
This bathtub.

46:23.460 --> 46:26.980
And they'd be like, well, would you do $1,200 a month?

46:28.260 --> 46:32.500
I think that you just have a gross misunderstanding

46:32.500 --> 46:33.700
of how that process works.

46:33.700 --> 46:35.300
Yeah, none of that is going to be-

46:35.300 --> 46:36.420
None of that's accurate.

46:37.540 --> 46:41.220
Also, like in renting, I've rented, I don't know,

46:41.220 --> 46:42.820
12 apartments in my lifetime.

46:42.820 --> 46:44.260
A lot of apartments.

46:44.260 --> 46:46.340
I don't know that I've ever been in a scenario

46:46.340 --> 46:48.500
where I was able to haggle a price.

46:48.500 --> 46:52.100
I think they say like, this apartment is $1,200 a month.

46:52.100 --> 46:53.460
And it's just like, okay.

46:53.460 --> 46:54.580
Let me ask you a question.

46:55.140 --> 46:55.700
Do you ask?

46:56.500 --> 46:57.380
Have you asked?

46:58.740 --> 47:01.060
Have I ever asked if it could be cheaper?

47:01.060 --> 47:01.300
Yes.

47:02.500 --> 47:03.940
You know, Justin, I haven't.

47:03.940 --> 47:04.980
There you go.

47:04.980 --> 47:06.500
The invitation was never there.

47:06.500 --> 47:08.900
They never said like, now what we're asking for

47:09.460 --> 47:10.900
is $1,200 a month.

47:10.900 --> 47:11.780
What do you think?

47:11.780 --> 47:15.220
They specifically say, Travis, you will pay me $1,200.

47:16.340 --> 47:18.500
I will take that money and it will be mine after that.

47:19.380 --> 47:22.340
Yeah, I like the straightforwardness

47:22.340 --> 47:23.860
of this arrangement.

47:23.860 --> 47:25.300
When I was living in Chicago,

47:25.300 --> 47:29.060
I shortchanged our landlord by $100 every month

47:29.060 --> 47:31.220
for six months without realizing it.

47:31.220 --> 47:32.340
Didn't say shit.

47:32.340 --> 47:33.700
That's what I call a power move.

47:35.220 --> 47:36.500
They didn't say shit either?

47:37.380 --> 47:39.060
No, I don't think they realized.

47:39.060 --> 47:40.900
It was like the first time they'd rented it out.

47:40.900 --> 47:42.260
And I don't think they, I don't know.

47:42.260 --> 47:44.180
Maybe they couldn't count that high.

47:44.180 --> 47:45.060
I don't know.

47:45.060 --> 47:46.340
They were really sweet landlords.

47:46.340 --> 47:47.460
I liked them a lot.

47:47.460 --> 47:49.540
But I stole $600 from them.

47:49.540 --> 47:50.500
Thank you.

47:50.500 --> 47:51.700
It's expensive in Chicago.

47:51.700 --> 47:52.260
I needed it.

47:53.220 --> 47:54.820
Could you pretend to be a ghost expert?

47:55.540 --> 47:56.660
Oh, yeah.

47:56.660 --> 47:59.940
In which I'm saying you show up your whole persona.

47:59.940 --> 48:01.060
Maybe your fursona.

48:01.060 --> 48:02.100
Maybe you're a fox witch.

48:02.100 --> 48:02.820
I don't know.

48:02.820 --> 48:08.420
Your whole persona is that of like a wizened magic user.

48:08.420 --> 48:10.500
Somebody who really understands the ethereal point.

48:10.500 --> 48:11.460
A magi.

48:11.460 --> 48:13.060
A magi, if you will.

48:13.060 --> 48:14.740
And you show up and you say,

48:14.740 --> 48:18.740
this home is pulsing with spectral energy

48:18.740 --> 48:21.620
and you're not gonna get a dollar over 700 for it.

48:21.620 --> 48:22.580
Trust me on this one.

48:22.580 --> 48:24.260
But I will make it my life's goal to,

48:24.260 --> 48:26.180
I'll go on Yelp and tell everybody

48:26.180 --> 48:27.540
this is a very, very positive part of it.

48:27.540 --> 48:29.940
I will Yelp review an individual house.

48:30.900 --> 48:31.700
I'll make you a deal.

48:31.700 --> 48:35.700
I wanna write a review for 1019 Washington Boulevard

48:35.700 --> 48:36.180
real quick.

48:36.980 --> 48:38.180
I want you in that house.

48:38.180 --> 48:39.380
And I am a magus.

48:39.380 --> 48:42.980
And let me tell you, it is pulsing with spectral energy.

48:42.980 --> 48:44.740
Two out of five would not live there.

48:44.740 --> 48:46.100
But if you do go,

48:46.100 --> 48:48.340
make sure to try the Parmesan bread bites.

48:48.340 --> 48:49.220
They're delicious.

48:50.100 --> 48:52.820
The previous owner had them in the refrigerator.

48:52.820 --> 48:54.900
I don't know if they were four guests,

48:54.900 --> 48:57.140
but I did take them and I enjoyed them.

48:57.140 --> 48:59.460
I don't know if he's gonna keep putting those in there

48:59.460 --> 49:00.980
or what's the situation.

49:04.740 --> 49:07.380
I say you do one better and you say,

49:07.380 --> 49:09.780
I'm not gonna pay a goddamn cent to live here,

49:09.780 --> 49:14.100
but I will be the ghost super for the whole building.

49:15.220 --> 49:16.740
Oh, like you'll help them move on

49:16.740 --> 49:18.900
or you'll protect the rest of the building from ghosts.

49:19.700 --> 49:21.380
I think it means like

49:21.380 --> 49:23.700
if there's a ghost related plumbing issue,

49:23.700 --> 49:25.540
ghosts get stuck in the pipes and God damn it.

49:25.540 --> 49:28.260
That's half a clogs that you deal with.

49:28.260 --> 49:29.940
Plumbers aren't ready for that shit

49:29.940 --> 49:32.420
because you didn't just knock a stick of deodorant in there.

49:32.420 --> 49:35.220
No, they're just taking caribous and shy guys and stuff.

49:35.220 --> 49:38.180
That's actually how rental prices in San Francisco got so bad

49:38.180 --> 49:39.780
is because they started letting a bunch of

49:40.500 --> 49:42.100
spectral supers live there

49:42.100 --> 49:43.860
and then they gotta make that up somewhere

49:43.860 --> 49:45.780
and you as a non-magic user

49:45.780 --> 49:46.980
are the one paying the price for that.

49:47.780 --> 49:50.660
It's government subsidizing.

49:51.460 --> 49:53.220
Subsidized spectral supers.

49:53.860 --> 49:54.820
So at the end of the day,

49:54.820 --> 49:56.260
take some night classes,

49:56.260 --> 49:57.620
like become a magus,

49:57.620 --> 50:00.100
be able to like take care of yourself

50:00.100 --> 50:01.940
and then you can get those discounts.

50:01.940 --> 50:04.260
I think Matthew Lesko sells a class on it

50:04.260 --> 50:05.940
if you wanna like I think it's something

50:05.940 --> 50:07.940
like you could make $10,000 a year

50:07.940 --> 50:09.860
just by being a ghost super,

50:09.860 --> 50:10.820
something along those lines.

50:10.820 --> 50:11.300
Check it out.

50:11.300 --> 50:12.340
Something like that.

50:12.340 --> 50:13.060
Open your eyes.

50:13.860 --> 50:15.780
And your heart to ghosts.

50:16.340 --> 50:18.020
Man, it's been a while since we talked about ghosts.

50:18.020 --> 50:20.580
It's like putting on a comfortable pair of jeans from college.

50:20.580 --> 50:24.740
You talked about Packing Your Bag as a Move Away.

50:24.740 --> 50:27.300
It's a real classic episode, a lot of hits.

50:27.300 --> 50:27.940
Yeah.

50:27.940 --> 50:28.660
A lot of the hits.

50:29.380 --> 50:31.060
Thank you for listening to our comedy podcast

50:31.060 --> 50:32.500
from Brother My Brother and Me.

50:32.500 --> 50:34.100
If you'd like to see us live,

50:34.100 --> 50:35.300
you can do just that.

50:35.300 --> 50:39.860
If you live anywhere near Seattle or Vancouver,

50:39.860 --> 50:41.540
we're coming there in late August,

50:42.260 --> 50:44.340
believe the, what is it?

50:44.340 --> 50:48.180
The 29th and 30th respectively to those two cities.

50:48.180 --> 50:49.380
We are also going to Portland,

50:49.380 --> 50:50.500
but tickets to that have sold out.

50:50.500 --> 50:51.220
If you're in Portland,

50:51.220 --> 50:52.340
you didn't get tickets to that show,

50:53.140 --> 50:54.660
come up to see us in Seattle.

50:54.660 --> 50:55.780
It's not that far of a drive.

50:55.780 --> 50:57.780
I have to drive that far

50:58.500 --> 51:00.100
literally every time I wanna see a concert

51:00.100 --> 51:01.140
with anybody I enjoy.

51:01.140 --> 51:02.020
So go for it.

51:02.020 --> 51:05.940
bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM Seattle

51:06.580 --> 51:08.340
is the address for the,

51:08.340 --> 51:10.100
as you may have guessed, the Seattle show.

51:10.100 --> 51:12.100
bit.ly forward slash van,

51:12.100 --> 51:15.460
MBMBAM is the Vancouver show.

51:16.660 --> 51:18.180
Those are both assigned seating.

51:18.180 --> 51:20.740
Okay, so don't sleep on that.

51:20.740 --> 51:22.260
Go get tickets.

51:22.260 --> 51:24.340
There are still some good seats in Vancouver,

51:25.860 --> 51:27.780
but you're gonna wanna act fast

51:27.780 --> 51:29.460
because they are going quickly.

51:29.460 --> 51:31.780
I wanna thank John Roderick in the long winters

51:31.780 --> 51:32.740
for the use of our theme song,

51:32.740 --> 51:33.700
It's a Departure off the album,

51:33.700 --> 51:34.900
Putting the Days to Bed.

51:34.900 --> 51:37.940
You can find that album on iTunes or Amazon,

51:37.940 --> 51:39.220
wherever it is you buy music.

51:40.260 --> 51:44.500
And again, I just wanna wish great luck

51:44.500 --> 51:48.660
to John Roderick for his Seattle City Council campaign.

51:48.660 --> 51:49.860
I hear it's going very well.

51:49.860 --> 51:53.140
I'm seeing some promising things on the AP wire.

51:53.140 --> 51:54.660
And this isn't like a bullshit.

51:54.660 --> 51:56.180
He's not doing this as a publicity stunt.

51:56.180 --> 51:56.980
No, it's not a goose.

51:56.980 --> 51:58.900
It's a real campaign.

51:58.900 --> 51:59.860
He's got some good ideas.

51:59.860 --> 52:00.900
I'm very excited for him.

52:01.780 --> 52:02.580
We also wanna add,

52:02.580 --> 52:05.060
if you enjoyed this episode and past episodes,

52:05.060 --> 52:07.620
why not hop on over to iTunes?

52:07.620 --> 52:11.060
Maybe subscribe, rate, review, that kind of thing.

52:11.060 --> 52:12.660
It'll take you about three minutes.

52:12.660 --> 52:15.060
And it really helps us in like the iTunes rankings

52:15.060 --> 52:18.180
and everything like that and bumps this on up the charts,

52:18.180 --> 52:19.540
which we always really appreciate.

52:19.540 --> 52:21.140
And it makes us feel good.

52:21.140 --> 52:23.620
We appreciate your positive feedback.

52:23.620 --> 52:26.420
There's a ton of other podcasts on Maximum Fun as well.

52:26.420 --> 52:27.460

52:34.260 --> 52:36.100
The three of us played D&D with our dad

52:36.100 --> 52:37.780
in a show called The Adventure Zone.

52:37.780 --> 52:40.420
Justin has a medical history show with his wife, Sydney,

52:40.420 --> 52:41.460

It's all at MaximumFun.org.

52:55.460 --> 53:00.100

53:00.100 --> 53:01.380
Let's do that this week, guys.

53:01.380 --> 53:02.500
That'd be great.

53:02.500 --> 53:03.220
That'd be pretty tight.

53:03.220 --> 53:04.980

53:37.060 --> 53:40.900
is Santa Monica Studios gonna make Kratos kill Jesus?

53:40.900 --> 53:44.020
I don't want Jesus to die in the future God of War games.

53:44.020 --> 53:45.060
You Christians agree?

that you need to seize today.

You're a taxpayer, right?
