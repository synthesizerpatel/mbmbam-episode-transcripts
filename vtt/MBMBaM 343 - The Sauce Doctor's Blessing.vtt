00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:48.160
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, the podcast.

00:48.720 --> 00:54.000
My name is Justin McElroy. Ring, ring, ring, ring. Sorry, let me get that. Yes, hello. Uh-huh.

00:54.000 --> 01:03.280
Uh-huh. I would love to, Marty, but I'm busy recording a podcast. Yeah? Okay. Okay. Sorry.

01:03.280 --> 01:06.240
This is your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. And this is your baby brother,

01:06.240 --> 01:11.520
Griffin McElroy. Hey, guys, what are we doing here? What? What is this? Oh, sorry. I just got

01:11.520 --> 01:16.960
a call from Marty Scorsese. Do you know? Oh, Marty. Do you know his work? He was just calling.

01:16.960 --> 01:24.160
He wants to direct a gritty, like McElroy Brothers-based movie with a lot of intrigue

01:24.160 --> 01:32.720
and betrayal. A lot of drug use. I was confused because me and legendary director Martin Scorsese,

01:32.720 --> 01:38.000
and over my hours of hanging out with him, I did learn the proper right way to say his name.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.960
I just call him El Scorcho. Thank you for correcting that pronunciation,

01:42.960 --> 01:48.320
because suddenly that makes so much more sense as to why when you're ribbing him about some of his

01:48.320 --> 01:54.080
badder movies, why you call him Martin Scorcheasy. It makes so much more sense to me now. Thank you.

01:54.080 --> 01:57.760
Yeah. So me and Scor- I had Scorcho on the phone the other day. He's like,

01:57.760 --> 02:02.000
Departed 2, are you in? And I was like, what's it all about? He's like, get this, Martin Sheen,

02:02.000 --> 02:07.040
he's back. He's super dyed in the- Yeah, no, he's back. And this time, you're his little brother.

02:07.040 --> 02:12.480
I don't even understand how chronologically, don't doubt the Scorch, he said to me, yelled it even.

02:12.480 --> 02:18.000
Ring, ring, ring, ring. Hello? Jerry. Okay. Yeah, it's J-Man.

02:20.960 --> 02:29.040
Yeah. These pretzels are making me thirsty. Okay. Great. Yeah. Yeah, just send him on over. Bye.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.560
Who was that, Justin? So that was Jerry Seinfeld. He watched the first episode of our TV show,

02:34.560 --> 02:40.560
and he is actually sending me all his Emmys in shame, he said. Oh, wow. He's embarrassed of his

02:40.560 --> 02:46.880
TV show, and he doesn't want the Emmys anymore, and he's sending them to me. That is both nice

02:46.880 --> 02:54.560
and humble of him. That's really sweet of him. He doesn't deserve them. He saw our comedy show,

02:54.560 --> 02:58.560
and he says, oh, that's how you do it. I don't deserve all these. I don't deserve all these

02:58.560 --> 03:05.200
Emmys. I'm going to give them back. Oh, hey, hold on one second. Oh, wow, a real phone ringtone.

03:05.200 --> 03:12.560
Hold on. Hello? Hey, Joe. How's it going? Do you want to... Oh, today? I'm a little bit...

03:13.200 --> 03:17.280
We could do lunch today. Pasta... You want to go to Pasta Garden?

03:19.680 --> 03:23.200
I think it's Olive Garden. The name of the restaurant is Olive Garden, not Pasta Garden.

03:25.120 --> 03:29.760
There's not a restaurant called Pasta Garden in Austin. That would be crazy if there's a

03:29.760 --> 03:34.240
restaurant called Pasta Garden. You get that, right? It's Olive Garden. Okay, fine. I'll meet

03:34.240 --> 03:42.400
you at the Pasta Garden. 1230? Fine. Okay, bye. That was Joe Pantaleano. He's in Austin,

03:42.400 --> 03:46.560
and he was insistent the restaurant was called Pasta Garden. I didn't know what to tell him.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.280
Jelly Pants.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.440
Griffin, I'm sorry. That was so rude of me. I left the sound on, but I actually got a text

03:51.440 --> 03:57.440
in the middle of that call from the Oscars committee, and they said that they were

03:57.440 --> 04:03.920
retroactively giving me Leonardo DiCaprio's Oscar. They were going to take it away from him

04:03.920 --> 04:09.440
for his Bear movie, and they're going to give it to me now so he still doesn't have an Oscar

04:09.440 --> 04:15.280
anymore. The Bear Challenger, I believe was the title of it. From Bear Man. The Bear Man movie.

04:15.280 --> 04:20.000
From Leo's ill-fated gritty Yogi Bear reboot.

04:22.640 --> 04:29.920
I love fame. It's so good. Let's just say it. I love this stuff, man.

04:29.920 --> 04:36.480
I can't get enough. I wish we weren't still under contract to do a thousand podcast episodes,

04:36.480 --> 04:39.680
or I would just quit doing this show and focus on being famous all the time.

04:40.720 --> 04:45.040
I mean, this podcast has been, I think, about as successful as the medium can get. Has it ever

04:45.040 --> 04:51.520
secured me one ticket to paradise, by which I mean a 1230 lunch reservation at Pasta Garden with my

04:51.520 --> 04:56.720
good friend Joe Pantaleano? No. Only television got me there. Only television got me across that

04:56.720 --> 04:57.680
beautiful finish line.

04:57.680 --> 05:02.640
There's just so much power that comes from being on a streaming internet comedy show.

05:03.200 --> 05:07.200
You know what I mean? You don't get that from podcasts. You got to get on the old media,

05:07.200 --> 05:08.960
like streaming internet comedy.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.000
Has it changed things, though?

05:12.560 --> 05:15.840
Has it changed things? That's what everybody's wanting to know.

05:15.840 --> 05:17.120
That's a problem.

05:17.120 --> 05:22.720
I'm recording this laying down on my polar bear skin rug, but I've always done that,

05:22.720 --> 05:24.240
so that's not new.

05:24.240 --> 05:28.800
It's like when Michael Jordan was playing basketball, wherever he did it before,

05:29.520 --> 05:36.000
he did it, and then he did it, and people were like, whoa, and he was like, things have changed.

05:37.360 --> 05:42.400
You know what I mean? He was the best basketball player, and as soon as people were crazy about

05:42.400 --> 05:46.880
number 23, he was just like, things have changed for me, I think.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.640
That's actually what most people-

05:48.640 --> 05:49.120
Oh, shit.

05:49.120 --> 05:55.120
Sorry, guys. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Hold on. MJ.

05:55.680 --> 05:56.640
Oh, it's actually him.

05:57.520 --> 06:06.880
Oh, yeah, dial him in. MJ. Hey. You want me to take... Oh, so I would be 23.

06:07.520 --> 06:08.080
Oh, wow.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.280
Okay, and the... Wow.

06:09.280 --> 06:10.240
It's the call, Travis.

06:10.880 --> 06:16.480
And, okay, so I'll be 23, and you're just going to give me all of your basketballs.

06:16.480 --> 06:21.040
Oh, okay. I mean, just from the one episode, don't you want to wait to see the rest of the...

06:22.480 --> 06:29.280
Okay. And, oh, yeah. Oh, well, the cover of Bad. So I'll be on the cover of all the copies of Bad

06:30.160 --> 06:35.360
that they sell from now on, and you'll get stickers to put my face on.

06:35.360 --> 06:37.280
Okay, so it's all MJs.

06:38.080 --> 06:38.320
Okay.

06:38.320 --> 06:39.120
Seems like it.

06:39.840 --> 06:44.240
Whoa. Mahalia Jackson, you're on here to... Wow. Okay, so you're going to give me

06:44.240 --> 06:48.480
your Grammys as well. So I'll be on the cover of Bad, I'll own Neverland Ranch,

06:48.480 --> 06:52.480
I get all the basketballs, and I'm number 23. Just from the one ep... You guys don't want to wait to...

06:53.760 --> 06:58.320
Okay. Sure. Yeah, for sure. Okay, thank you so much. That means a lot. Thanks.

06:59.440 --> 07:05.280
Yeah, these pretzels are making me thirsty too. Yeah. Love that shit. Okay, bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.440
Wow, Juice, that sounded like a pretty big call.

07:09.440 --> 07:13.600
Just a lot of MJs giving me their honors and their awards and their recognitions.

07:13.600 --> 07:17.440
Well, congratulations for all your... Ah, fucking shit. Hold on one second.

07:20.480 --> 07:25.520
Hey, Bryce? I can't today, Bryce. I'm sorry. Bye. This is my friend, Bryce.

07:27.440 --> 07:31.040
He wanted to get lunch, but obviously I'm spoken for, so...

07:33.920 --> 07:37.680
This has never been more important that we help people.

07:37.680 --> 07:47.680
Oh, sorry. Just one more call. Sorry. Yes, hello? Joseph Gordon Biden.

07:48.240 --> 07:58.800
Oh, no. A life debt? Uh-huh. Follow me to the ends of the earth? Uh-huh. Like a Belvedere situation?

07:58.800 --> 08:08.400
Okay. Can you start tomorrow? Cool. Cool, cool, cool. All right. I'll have Debra send over the

08:08.400 --> 08:15.280
address. I'll see you then. Okay. Bye. Guys, you'll never believe who it was.

08:16.480 --> 08:20.160
I can't guess. It was Barack Obama.

08:21.040 --> 08:22.320
Whoa, weird. Okay.

08:22.320 --> 08:23.440
Doing a character?

08:23.440 --> 08:26.720
Yeah, he was using his nom de plume, Joseph Gordon Biden.

08:26.720 --> 08:35.760
All right. I think it's time that we reveal that these have all been pranks that we have done so

08:35.760 --> 08:40.480
far. Basically, everything you've heard up to this point, except my fucking rude friend,

08:40.480 --> 08:45.600
Bryce calling me, somehow piercing through the do not disturb that I have said on my phone.

08:45.600 --> 08:49.280
I don't know how you hacked into my shit to get the phone call through, but all the other stuff

08:49.280 --> 08:56.560
has been just pranks, and we don't know these people. We hope you enjoyed all the

08:56.560 --> 08:57.680
stuff we've done so far.

08:57.680 --> 09:01.760
We would never do something like that on the TV show. We really save our really fully formed

09:02.880 --> 09:07.280
great gags for our new medium of television.

09:08.320 --> 09:13.760
Should we do... Please watch our TV show. It comes out on Thursday on CSO. Go get CSO on

09:13.760 --> 09:17.360
whatever set top box you got. Go to CSO.com and check it out on Thursday.

09:18.640 --> 09:25.680
And if you want to and you haven't yet, we have an episode of the show up now. You can see it on

09:25.680 --> 09:34.960
YouTube. I put a link to it on McElroyShows.com, and you can watch a full episode now wherever

09:34.960 --> 09:36.720
you are. So go enjoy that.

09:36.720 --> 09:41.680
Sorry, by the way, sorry that the one that we put out has spiders in it. Apparently,

09:41.680 --> 09:48.000
for some people, that's challenging. I've heard it's a challenging thing for some people. A lot

09:48.000 --> 09:53.040
of people are not very pleased about that, and I am sorry for that.

09:53.040 --> 09:57.280
It is the only episode with spiders in it, though. I can guarantee that.

09:57.280 --> 10:02.080
Yes. Let's hit... Can we do some fucking advice, please?

10:02.880 --> 10:08.400
My husband calls petting the dog, rubbing the dog's fur. How can I make him stop?

10:09.040 --> 10:11.360
That's from Dogs Deserve Dignity in Michigan.

10:12.080 --> 10:17.280
I don't know that this is like a full meaty question. So much as I just want to say to

10:17.280 --> 10:24.960
the question asker's husband, I respect you. This idea of... This was probably one time

10:24.960 --> 10:28.320
you meant to say, I'm going to go pet the dog, and you couldn't think of the word pet,

10:28.320 --> 10:33.360
and you said, I'm going to go rub the dog's fur, and you fucking committed to it. And you're like,

10:33.360 --> 10:40.560
this is me now. I'm a man who pets dogs, I rub dogs fur from now on. That's me for life.

10:41.280 --> 10:46.880
I have to say, I think that the question asker said they call themselves Dogs Deserve Dignity

10:46.880 --> 10:53.440
in Michigan. I would argue that this is a much more dignified way of referring to the practice.

10:53.440 --> 10:57.200
Because by saying you're petting the dog, what you're saying inherently is like,

10:57.760 --> 11:01.440
I'm petting my possession, I'm owning my possession, which is a pet.

11:01.440 --> 11:03.200
I'm massaging my friend.

11:04.160 --> 11:09.680
My friend has fur, just happens to have fur, and I'm rubbing it with my hand,

11:09.680 --> 11:14.480
which is an equal appendage to a paw. We are all on equal playing field here.

11:14.480 --> 11:20.160
I am going to go interact with the dog in an adult, consensual way.

11:20.160 --> 11:25.680
I'm going to massage my friend's hairy body in a way that we will both enjoy very much.

11:25.680 --> 11:29.600
And when you say it like that, it could be anyone at that point, you know what I mean?

11:31.440 --> 11:37.360
That's not patronizing to the dog. I'm going to go rub my friend's hairy body. That's universal.

11:37.360 --> 11:44.000
I'm feeding my friend some table trash, and I know some do not approve, but this is a personal

11:44.000 --> 11:49.200
relationship between my friend and I, where I feed him trash from the table.

11:49.200 --> 11:52.160
I'm watching my friend defecate in my yard.

11:52.160 --> 11:57.200
My friend looks hungry, so I'm going to serve them up a tall bowl of stink cereal.

11:57.200 --> 12:01.600
I'm just going to tie this rope around my friend's neck and walk him down the street.

12:01.600 --> 12:07.280
It's for my friend, though, because he'll see a car and he'll be murdered by the car, by a person.

12:07.280 --> 12:10.480
So the rope is for my friend.

12:10.480 --> 12:17.760
Hi, thanks for seeing me on such short notice. I need you to express my friend's anal glands,

12:17.760 --> 12:22.080
and I need you to express my friend's anal glands, and I need you to express my friend's

12:22.080 --> 12:29.120
anal glands, and I need you to express my friend's anal glands, and I need you to do it in a mature,

12:29.120 --> 12:34.000
consensual way, because it's too yucky for me personally, because we're friends,

12:34.000 --> 12:35.360
and it would be overstepping the line.

12:35.360 --> 12:38.720
And please don't make eye contact with my friend while you do it. He hates that.

12:39.440 --> 12:47.040
My friend ate my fucking car keys, and so I'm not really sure what to do about that.

12:47.040 --> 12:52.160
I was rubbing his hairy body, and I looked down, and my dang keys were gone.

12:54.880 --> 12:58.160
Do you guys want a Yahoo? This is good. Just keep doing this. You're fine.

12:59.200 --> 13:03.840
This one was sent in by Aaron Keys. Thank you, Aaron. It's by Yahoo Answers user AGLU, who asks,

13:05.280 --> 13:09.200
should it be illegal to steal someone's kill on Call of Duty?

13:11.760 --> 13:15.920
So I've just been playing some Call of Duty Black Ops 2 when this kid kept stealing my kills.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.960
It was the same person over and over. Every time I went in for a kill,

13:18.960 --> 13:23.920
this kid just ran in and took it. 11 assists I got. They should have been kills.

13:23.920 --> 13:27.600
So I think you should be put in prison for stealing someone's kills in an FPS.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.640
Remind me, which one is the Call of Duties?

13:31.360 --> 13:35.120
It's the one with the soldier men, but they have future guns.

13:35.120 --> 13:41.600
Gotcha. You know, the irony here is that it's illegal to steal someone's kill in a video game,

13:41.600 --> 13:45.840
but in real life, if you're about to kill someone and somebody else kills them first,

13:45.840 --> 13:50.240
that's suddenly illegal. You're now legal. You're off the hook.

13:50.240 --> 13:50.880
Yeah, you're good to go.

13:50.880 --> 13:55.680
Because you didn't actually do the kill, you know what I mean? It's ironic if you think about it.

13:55.680 --> 14:05.600
But if you want to get all the, I don't know, duty points that you can use to buy new

14:06.400 --> 14:15.120
weed emblems, weed skins for your gun to turn your character into just a big three-dimensional

14:15.120 --> 14:23.680
sort of ganja guy, you can buy him for 3000 duty bucks, you're going to need to get those kills.

14:23.680 --> 14:30.560
And this child is coming in and really just griefing him. And so can I put the kid in jail?

14:32.000 --> 14:36.160
Actual jail, too. This person is talking about real-world physical

14:36.800 --> 14:38.160
jail, not just Call of Duty jail.

14:38.160 --> 14:41.840
No, this is interesting, Travis. You've just given...

14:41.840 --> 14:45.200
Justin and I work in the video games industry.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.960
So we know the people to talk to to make things happen.

14:46.960 --> 14:50.320
We know the people to talk to to get these sorts of ideas going because

14:50.320 --> 14:56.320
I think there should be a jail for every game. And not like you get banned and you can't play

14:56.320 --> 15:03.040
the game. I think if you do too much bad stuff, maybe not stealing somebody's kill, but if you

15:03.040 --> 15:10.240
call somebody mini epithets, then the next time you log in, your weed-shaped soldier man is just

15:10.240 --> 15:14.320
in a cage. And there's a little timer there that's like one month, he's in the cage.

15:14.320 --> 15:15.680
Like real time?

15:15.680 --> 15:17.120
Real time one month.

15:17.120 --> 15:21.120
Yeah, real time one month. And you can walk around in the cage and try to find a way out,

15:21.120 --> 15:23.600
but there is no way out. You're in the cage.

15:23.600 --> 15:27.440
Is there an opportunity, Griffin, there for a time off for good behavior thing

15:27.440 --> 15:31.520
where they bring other people to the cage that you can talk to and say,

15:31.520 --> 15:37.760
let me tell you why I'm in here and you shouldn't make fun of people online and be mean to them.

15:37.760 --> 15:41.760
And maybe that shaves some time off of your sentence.

15:41.760 --> 15:47.200
When you log on, the cage is also filled with orphans and there is a book there in the cage.

15:47.200 --> 15:52.320
So if you read to them stories, read them The Lion, The Witch, The Wardrobe or whatever,

15:52.320 --> 15:54.400
you can shave some time off your sentence.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.000
And the orphans are real time.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.040
You gotta really read it.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.480
Real time, real orphans.

15:58.480 --> 16:03.360
Plug in your microphone. I know. Dig it out. Gotta read orphans.

16:03.360 --> 16:07.760
Listen, I have some advice for you, question asker.

16:10.240 --> 16:11.120
Get good.

16:11.120 --> 16:11.760
Oh yeah.

16:11.760 --> 16:14.560
Just close the murder deal.

16:14.560 --> 16:14.800
Yeah.

16:14.800 --> 16:23.760
You opened the store of murdering and you didn't stick around to close up for the day.

16:23.760 --> 16:25.840
There's probably a better metaphor there, but get good.

16:25.840 --> 16:26.800
Yeah.

16:26.800 --> 16:29.600
Scrub, just get good. Just close the deal.

16:29.600 --> 16:34.080
If you would have given them one right in the old brain box,

16:34.080 --> 16:36.560
they wouldn't have time to get stolen.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.200
You know what I mean?

16:37.200 --> 16:38.240
Can't steal a headshot.

16:38.240 --> 16:39.760
Can't steal a noscope.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.080
May I pitch a zag?

16:43.600 --> 16:44.320
Yeah, sure.

16:44.320 --> 16:48.320
Should we all get fucking MLG pro level Call of Duty gamers?

16:48.320 --> 16:48.880
No, no, no.

16:48.880 --> 16:50.320
Start a clan or something?

16:50.320 --> 16:55.600
Question asker follows this kill stealer around and steals their kill stealings.

16:55.600 --> 17:00.160
Like you have a sniper rifle right over their shoulder as they're pointing a sniper rifle.

17:00.160 --> 17:02.960
They can't see you because they're looking down their sniper rifle and it's like,

17:02.960 --> 17:06.400
oh, he's about, and I stole his kill steal.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.200
Stole it back.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.280
I'm the Robin Hood of Call of Duty.

17:11.200 --> 17:11.680
Sort of.

17:12.480 --> 17:15.680
Yeah, I steal the kill from the kill stealer.

17:15.680 --> 17:18.400
Steal, fuck, got away from me.

17:18.960 --> 17:22.400
What if everybody just waits for everybody else to initiate the fight?

17:22.400 --> 17:25.600
There's only kill stealing and then nobody starts it.

17:25.600 --> 17:27.760
It's like, oh, it's reservoir dogs.

17:27.760 --> 17:29.680
Why don't we talk it out, you know?

17:29.680 --> 17:31.440
Like maybe we just talk through it.

17:31.440 --> 17:34.000
Whatever's going on between the red guys and the blue guys.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.440
Maybe we just figure it out.

17:35.440 --> 17:36.320
I like that.

17:36.880 --> 17:42.320
It's like, hey, rather than kill stealing, let's just sit down and rap about this beef.

17:43.680 --> 17:46.000
Let's wrap this beef up and sell it.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.200
Check this out.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.520
New Call of Duty game comes out next month

17:49.520 --> 17:52.160
because I'm pretty sure them shits are coming out on a monthly basis now.

17:52.800 --> 17:53.520
You pick it up.

17:53.520 --> 17:54.960
You get it together with your friends.

17:54.960 --> 17:56.480
You get all your stuff together.

17:56.480 --> 17:57.360
You're four loco.

17:57.360 --> 18:00.400
It's a time for a night full of shooting and hooting.

18:00.400 --> 18:04.720
And you go in and you play a met round and you do okay.

18:04.720 --> 18:05.840
You get like six kills.

18:05.840 --> 18:07.840
Your friend Benny gets 14.

18:07.840 --> 18:08.640
You're like, damn, Benny.

18:08.640 --> 18:09.760
He's like, I just have it.

18:09.760 --> 18:10.480
I just have it.

18:11.040 --> 18:12.000
And then the match ends.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.880
You're like, time to rack up my duty bucks and see how well I did.

18:14.880 --> 18:19.680
And you and all of your teammates and everybody you played against are all in small jail cells.

18:19.680 --> 18:23.520
And there's just like, I think there's just a guy that comes and walks through the jail,

18:23.520 --> 18:24.400
like the warden.

18:24.400 --> 18:28.160
And he's just like, what were you guys doing in there?

18:28.160 --> 18:29.200
You can't just kill.

18:29.200 --> 18:31.520
You can't just shoot and kill and hurt.

18:31.520 --> 18:32.480
So what did you do?

18:32.480 --> 18:33.280
Six kills?

18:33.280 --> 18:35.600
That's fucking 14 to life.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.680
So that's pretty, that's not great.

18:37.680 --> 18:38.240
Benny.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.200
Oh my God.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.200
Benny actually come with me.

18:41.200 --> 18:49.600
Benny, it's, we save this for only the most brutal monsters that rear their heads in this game.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.440
But you need to come with me now, Benny.

18:52.160 --> 18:55.360
Maybe you follow after this person steals your kill.

18:55.920 --> 18:57.840
Just get right up in their face and scream.

18:57.840 --> 18:58.560
What did you do?

18:59.360 --> 19:01.360
That was a living person.

19:01.360 --> 19:01.680
Yeah.

19:01.680 --> 19:02.560
You can't just snuff.

19:02.560 --> 19:04.000
I was just trying to scare him.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.960
You can't just snuff out a human life like that, you animal.

19:06.960 --> 19:09.680
And then follow them around for the rest of the game shouting that kind of thing.

19:09.680 --> 19:09.920
Yeah.

19:09.920 --> 19:10.560
Yeah.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.800
That's going to hurt their KD for sure.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.080
Or at least hurt their feelings.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.720
It's going to hurt their KD lying.

19:18.160 --> 19:18.960
Read another one.

19:19.520 --> 19:22.800
I work at a software company and we have a communal kitchen with shared dishes.

19:23.440 --> 19:27.360
During the other day, during lunch the other day, sorry.

19:27.360 --> 19:31.120
I caught a coworker lifting a plate to his face and licking it clean.

19:31.760 --> 19:36.720
I had a full on panic attack in my head as I watched in horror as he continued unabated

19:36.720 --> 19:43.280
in his quest to get every morsel of sauce off a plate that I could very well be using tomorrow.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.440
My question is this.

19:45.440 --> 19:48.640
Are you hiring because now I need a new job?

19:48.640 --> 19:51.200
And that's from Clean Plate Club in Atlanta, Georgia.

19:51.840 --> 19:54.560
Holy shit.

19:54.560 --> 19:55.520
No, no.

19:56.640 --> 19:57.120
Yes.

19:57.120 --> 19:57.360
No.

19:57.360 --> 19:57.920
What?

19:57.920 --> 19:58.320
No.

19:58.320 --> 19:59.600
What, Griffin?

19:59.600 --> 19:59.920
What?

19:59.920 --> 20:01.280
How could you?

20:01.280 --> 20:03.360
I feel betrayed by you, Griffin.

20:03.360 --> 20:04.000
Okay, fine.

20:04.000 --> 20:09.360
But if you go to a fucking nice restaurant and you and you see how I did the accent there.

20:09.360 --> 20:11.840
That's how you know how nice this restaurant was.

20:12.400 --> 20:17.040
And you fucking get yourself a fucking etouffee.

20:17.040 --> 20:17.920
Play the gumbo.

20:17.920 --> 20:18.640
Gumbo.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.480
Get yourself an etouffee.

20:20.480 --> 20:28.240
And you finish the etouffee but you don't want to waste the good hard work done by the sauce doctor.

20:29.040 --> 20:32.080
Then you fucking lick it all up good and then guess what?

20:32.080 --> 20:35.600
You're going to put it in like a hot, steamy, soapy box.

20:35.600 --> 20:40.000
And then all of your tongue stuff is just going to be gone in the soapy box.

20:40.560 --> 20:45.440
Griffin, this person did not go to the Cajun kitchen.

20:45.440 --> 20:50.560
This person fucking microwaved a Stover's lasagna and like-

20:50.560 --> 20:51.040
You don't know that.

20:51.040 --> 20:51.520
You don't know that.

20:51.520 --> 20:52.240
You don't know that.

20:52.240 --> 20:52.960
You don't know that.

20:52.960 --> 20:53.440
You don't know that.

20:53.440 --> 20:56.800
I do know that because they were in the break room at work.

20:57.520 --> 20:58.800
Like, this was not-

20:58.800 --> 21:03.280
Okay, even so, Griffin, are you telling me it is your belief

21:03.280 --> 21:09.200
that this work break room has a functioning sanitizing dishwasher in it

21:09.840 --> 21:15.120
and not just a sink that people lazily rinse dishes in

21:15.120 --> 21:17.120
and then immediately put back in the cabinet?

21:18.880 --> 21:19.440
I don't know.

21:19.440 --> 21:20.800
There's a lot of variables here.

21:20.800 --> 21:26.800
But even if it was just you run hot soapy water over it, their tongue stuff is gone.

21:26.800 --> 21:29.840
How are you guys this upset about this?

21:29.840 --> 21:31.840
Because I know, Griffin.

21:31.840 --> 21:34.000
And even worse, I sort of know.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.720
Because if all the plates look the same, they're all bad now.

21:38.720 --> 21:39.120
They're all-

21:39.120 --> 21:39.840
What are you going to do?

21:39.840 --> 21:41.520
You're going to fucking walk up to them and grab the plate

21:41.520 --> 21:42.960
and fucking shatter it on the floor and be like,

21:42.960 --> 21:46.240
I hope you enjoyed the sauce doctor's good work, but now-

21:46.240 --> 21:46.740
Yes.

21:49.040 --> 21:49.540
Okay.

21:50.240 --> 21:55.200
We're glossing over the point that this is unacceptable workplace behavior.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.880
There is also that.

21:56.880 --> 22:00.000
You can't watch someone do that and then like,

22:00.000 --> 22:04.720
I guess we're teaming up on the new project for the boss together.

22:04.720 --> 22:09.360
And also I just watched you lick a plate clean like my friend who is a dog.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.360
Like my hair friend.

22:11.360 --> 22:12.560
Like my hairy friend.

22:13.920 --> 22:17.280
So guys, close your eyes and just think of,

22:17.280 --> 22:24.080
have you ever had something where the good stuff wasn't immediately fork accessible

22:24.080 --> 22:30.080
and you had to go hair friend on the plate to get to receive the sauce doctor's blessing?

22:30.080 --> 22:32.400
Then you mop it up with a bread, buddy, Griffin.

22:32.400 --> 22:32.800
Crusty bread.

22:32.800 --> 22:34.240
A nice crusty bread.

22:34.240 --> 22:34.720
Okay.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.640
So they just have sauce bread.

22:36.640 --> 22:36.960
They have like a bowl of-

22:36.960 --> 22:38.560
You plan ahead, Griffin.

22:38.560 --> 22:40.320
You have to plan ahead.

22:40.320 --> 22:43.120
If you know that you got a good sauce from the sauce doctor,

22:43.120 --> 22:46.480
you got to bring a crusty bread, buddy, and plan the fuck ahead.

22:46.480 --> 22:50.080
You can't just fucking like live in the moment and lick it clean.

22:50.720 --> 22:53.120
Could you bring crusty bread to this person?

22:53.120 --> 22:53.760
Say hey.

22:53.760 --> 22:54.960
I use this.

22:54.960 --> 22:57.040
I saw you licking the plate like a toddler.

22:57.040 --> 22:58.960
Would you maybe enjoy a baguette?

22:58.960 --> 22:59.440
For next time.

22:59.440 --> 23:02.800
Can I maybe interest you in this for next time forever?

23:02.800 --> 23:05.840
And also, can you go back and find the plates that you've ever licked in your life

23:05.840 --> 23:07.440
and shatter them, please?

23:07.440 --> 23:10.160
The only place that this is okay, work behavior.

23:10.160 --> 23:11.680
This is all right work behavior.

23:11.680 --> 23:13.520
If you work at someplace like Pixar,

23:13.520 --> 23:16.320
where everything is just a little bit more cash, you know?

23:16.320 --> 23:18.880
Everybody's just razor scootering around

23:18.880 --> 23:21.760
and they've made their cubicles look like tiki huts.

23:21.760 --> 23:25.920
And like, you know, they've got a ping pong table in the break room.

23:25.920 --> 23:26.480
Okay.

23:26.480 --> 23:27.120
Lick it clean.

23:27.120 --> 23:27.360
Fine.

23:27.360 --> 23:28.960
We're all in Hawaiian shirts anyways.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.560
It's all higgledy-piggledy up in the air.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.320
You nervously walk into John Lasseter's office

23:35.200 --> 23:40.480
and he's, I don't know, he's in there eating himself a good plate of gumbo.

23:41.040 --> 23:42.800
And you're like, hey, I've got a good pitch for a movie.

23:42.800 --> 23:44.320
And he's like, oh, just one second.

23:44.880 --> 23:48.000
And then he licks the plate clean because he's John Lasseter and he can do whatever.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.400
It takes 15 minutes in complete silence.

23:50.400 --> 23:51.040
Complete silence.

23:51.040 --> 23:54.720
And he leaves one little scrap of the sauce doctor's blessing right there.

23:54.720 --> 23:55.520
He's like, what?

23:55.520 --> 23:57.520
Oh, yeah, it sounds good.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.640
What are you talking about?

23:58.640 --> 24:00.800
It's cats, but they are firefighters.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.320
Yeah, sure, what the fuck ever.

24:02.320 --> 24:04.720
We did airplanes as firefighters, so I don't see why not.

24:04.720 --> 24:05.680
Anyway, come on over here.

24:05.680 --> 24:07.680
And I guess if you want me to green light this,

24:08.320 --> 24:12.240
why don't you get up on this sauce doctor's blessing with your dog tongue?

24:13.600 --> 24:14.560
What did you say to me, John?

24:15.120 --> 24:17.360
Lick this up with your doggy tongue

24:17.360 --> 24:21.040
if you want me to make your cat firefighter movie.

24:22.080 --> 24:23.920
You're a good hairy boy.

24:23.920 --> 24:28.000
Why don't you lick the sauce doctor's blessing from this terrain?

24:28.960 --> 24:30.000
But it's a trick.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.120
It's a trick test.

24:31.120 --> 24:32.240
You go over there, lick it.

24:32.240 --> 24:36.240
But before you do, you realize that he has licked the sauce, the remaining sauce,

24:36.240 --> 24:40.800
into the perfect shape of the next Nemo-esque hit character.

24:40.800 --> 24:42.400
We're like, sauce boy.

24:42.400 --> 24:46.800
And then that's all over bed spreads and lunch boxes.

24:46.800 --> 24:48.160
Sauce boy everywhere.

24:48.160 --> 24:50.320
Because he's John fucking Lasseter and he's a genius.

24:50.320 --> 24:54.560
And you slurp up the sauce doctor's blessing right off this plate.

24:54.560 --> 24:58.000
And John says, I could never make a movie with such a nasty boy.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.520
And then he drives off in the bumper car he's been sitting in the whole time.

25:02.800 --> 25:05.120
And he snapchatted you with doing it.

25:05.120 --> 25:07.520
And he put it on his snapchat so now everybody's seeing it.

25:07.520 --> 25:08.160
And you're ruined.

25:08.160 --> 25:08.660
Damn it.

25:09.520 --> 25:10.560
Got me again, John?

25:11.600 --> 25:12.960
You'll put that on the gram, huh?

25:12.960 --> 25:14.720
You make such, you make great movies, John.

25:14.720 --> 25:18.400
But your Machiavellian plots in the workplace, they need to stop.

25:18.960 --> 25:22.640
Hey, and also, John, for future reference, John, you kind of just fired me.

25:22.640 --> 25:22.960
Yeah.

25:22.960 --> 25:24.400
You're the boss of the thing.

25:24.400 --> 25:28.560

25:47.680 --> 25:48.480
He was in the Matrix.

25:48.480 --> 25:49.680
Do you think we could get him?

25:49.680 --> 25:56.320
We can get him in as Taz, Tabby, we'll figure out the name later, John.

25:56.320 --> 25:57.360

26:04.160 --> 26:05.120
He's a tabby who drives a cab.

26:05.120 --> 26:06.800
Tabby Cabby, he's in a cab and he drives around?

26:06.800 --> 26:09.760
He's in a cab and he drives around?

26:09.760 --> 26:10.960
I'm off the, I'm off the project.

26:31.200 --> 26:32.160
Just put it on speaker quick.

26:32.160 --> 26:32.720
I want to hear him.

26:32.720 --> 26:38.720
Yeah, let me put it on speaker, hold on.

26:38.720 --> 26:41.280
Well, that's uncalled for.

26:41.280 --> 26:41.780
Yeah.

26:42.800 --> 26:45.840
I wouldn't say we stole any of your jokes for the show.

26:45.840 --> 26:46.560
When you and I were.

26:51.200 --> 26:54.160
OK, well, that's, I mean, that's, that's racist.

26:54.720 --> 26:56.400
You know, you know that that's.

26:58.880 --> 27:00.320
No, I want to work this out with you, too.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.080
Yeah, OK.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.120
Let's find something.

27:03.120 --> 27:05.600
How about instead of a protracted legal battle,

27:05.600 --> 27:09.680
you and I find something that we can work together on soon?

27:09.680 --> 27:10.960
Justin, Justin, Justin, pitch him.

27:10.960 --> 27:12.960
Well, that sounds pretty good.

27:12.960 --> 27:14.160
Whoa, whoa.

27:14.160 --> 27:14.660
Whoa.

27:15.600 --> 27:16.720
Thank you for calming down.

27:16.720 --> 27:17.920
First off, thank you.

27:18.640 --> 27:20.880
Travis, did you have something you want me to add to Tasmanian Devil?

27:20.880 --> 27:24.000
Pitch him the cat firefighter movie with the tabby cabby.

27:24.000 --> 27:24.800
Yeah, tabby cabby.

27:24.800 --> 27:25.680
Give him tabby cabby.

27:25.680 --> 27:30.240
Hey, I had a project where, you know, Lassie?

27:30.240 --> 27:32.240
John Lasseter.

27:32.240 --> 27:32.800
Yeah, Lassie.

27:34.800 --> 27:35.920
So here's the pitch.

27:35.920 --> 27:41.760
Tabby cabby is a cat that drives a cab and.

27:41.760 --> 27:43.040
Reel him in, reel him in.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.240
You know, there's an arc.

27:44.880 --> 27:52.720
Of course, he goes to China and there's lots.

27:52.720 --> 27:53.680
Give him the name.

27:53.680 --> 27:55.520
We got Joey Pants attached.

27:55.520 --> 27:59.360
And we got Joey Pants is in basically.

27:59.360 --> 28:03.360
We, the ink is not spilled yet on that one, but.

28:05.920 --> 28:08.720
Yeah, I thought it sounded pretty intriguing too.

28:12.720 --> 28:13.680
The pretzels are making me.

28:15.040 --> 28:16.000
Love that gag.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.760
Anyway, Taz, I will talk to you so soon.

28:17.760 --> 28:19.120
I'm doing the podcast.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.920
I know still, believe it or not.

28:21.920 --> 28:22.240
Yeah.

28:22.240 --> 28:22.720
Okay.

28:27.040 --> 28:38.720
We don't hang up, we just go to money zone.

28:38.720 --> 28:40.240
That sounds pretty good, Taz.

28:40.240 --> 28:41.440
Let's all go together.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.640
Can I tell you all about a thing that's very important?

28:55.200 --> 28:56.800
Very close to me, literally.

28:56.800 --> 28:57.600

28:58.160 --> 28:58.640
Yeah.

28:58.640 --> 28:59.040
Yeah.

28:59.040 --> 29:00.000
I'm talking about me undies.

29:01.680 --> 29:03.440
Basically, my whole collection now is me undies.

29:03.440 --> 29:05.360

If this message had popped up on adventure zone, like it'd be a pretty easy, like,

32:21.440 --> 32:23.200
oh, this is a D and D group.

32:23.200 --> 32:29.280
Um, which it, which it is, but it's also like the big, can you imagine if we did adventure

32:29.280 --> 32:32.160
zone and there were 12 fucking people on the call each week?

32:32.160 --> 32:34.240
This is so many adventurers.

32:34.240 --> 32:35.280
It's a hell of a thing.

32:35.280 --> 32:40.240
We're crossing time, planes, and storylines to congratulate you on officially becoming

32:40.240 --> 32:41.760

Dr. John from, from one, um, from one DM to the other.

33:07.200 --> 33:10.960
Although again, like, this is a Herculean effort that you've done here.

33:10.960 --> 33:15.920
Cause maybe they're doing, I've done this before where I had like a D and D league where

33:15.920 --> 33:19.440
we had like 10 people and we would swap in whoever was available that night.

33:19.440 --> 33:21.440
So we didn't have to like wait.

33:21.440 --> 33:24.640
And then like we would just level people up accordingly when they would step in.

33:25.360 --> 33:27.120
That'd be cool if I could do that with you guys.

33:27.920 --> 33:28.880
Just replace us?

33:28.880 --> 33:32.960
Well, just like if they have a bad week, it's like, well, let's just try out somebody else.

Let's give Rothfuss a chance.

33:34.160 --> 33:35.280
Let's see what he does in there.

33:36.320 --> 33:38.640
Uh, so congratulations, Dr. John.

33:38.640 --> 33:40.640
Sounds like you were in the right place at the right time.

33:40.640 --> 33:41.440
God, Justin.

34:10.720 --> 34:11.280
Good.

34:11.280 --> 34:16.000
After five years of friendship, I'm proud of the nerdy, loving, healthy relationship

34:16.000 --> 34:17.120
we've built together.

34:17.120 --> 34:20.880
I love you as much as I love hit points or Harry Potter.

34:20.880 --> 34:21.920
It's HP.

34:21.920 --> 34:23.040
Probably Harry Potter.

34:23.040 --> 34:23.520
Probably Harry Potter.

34:23.520 --> 34:29.120
I love you as much as I love Hewlett Packard and you love Star Wars combined.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.280
Thank you for being you, Boo.

34:31.840 --> 34:34.880
And so it's just a nice message.

34:34.880 --> 34:36.480
There's nothing to really congratulate them on.

34:38.160 --> 34:40.640
So birthday, I guess.

34:40.640 --> 34:42.240
It seems like the month for the birthday.

34:42.240 --> 34:44.080
So happy birthday, Joe.

34:44.080 --> 34:50.400
I love you as much as I love Harvey Purvis, who is an accountant living in San Bernardino.

35:40.560 --> 35:41.600
Got a few good ones.

35:41.600 --> 35:45.200
This one was sent in by, and I apologize for how bad I'm going to pronounce this,

35:45.200 --> 35:51.760
but from Aulia Irham Waisessa, who, thank you, Aulia.

35:51.760 --> 35:53.280
It's from Yahoo Answers User.

35:53.280 --> 35:54.240
They are anonymous.

35:55.040 --> 35:55.680
Let's call them.

35:56.880 --> 36:04.640
Todd asks, would a toaster still work in a freezer?

36:07.920 --> 36:11.600
Their subhead for this is, would this create cold toast, which is fucking stupid.

36:11.600 --> 36:15.200
But the good question is there at the top.

36:15.200 --> 36:19.440
You put a fucking toaster in a freezer, run the extension cord in there.

36:19.440 --> 36:20.800
You put some good bread in there.

36:20.800 --> 36:21.600
You click it down.

36:22.160 --> 36:23.840
What even happens, right?

36:23.840 --> 36:29.120
Because you say, if you think it would get hot, well, then the freezer hasn't done its job.

36:29.840 --> 36:32.960
But if you say it gets cold, then the toaster hasn't done its job.

36:33.920 --> 36:40.160
Let me say there is a factor here which makes this more of a brain puzzle to me.

36:40.160 --> 36:40.800
Yeah.

36:40.800 --> 36:44.640
If you immediately take the toaster, put it in the freezer, press the thing down,

36:44.640 --> 36:49.760
I think like, yes, it's still going to work because the freezer has not had time.

36:49.760 --> 36:56.080
But if you put the toaster in the freezer for say like 20, 30 minutes, then do it.

36:56.080 --> 36:56.320
Yeah.

36:56.320 --> 37:01.680
So like the coils, those toaster coils, they done cooled down.

37:01.680 --> 37:04.240
And so it might come to room temperature.

37:04.240 --> 37:08.240
So you might end up with room temperature bread because it's a timed thing.

37:08.240 --> 37:10.960
Unless you have a toaster that operates on some kind of heat sensor.

37:10.960 --> 37:12.400
I think it's a timed thing.

37:12.400 --> 37:15.680
So you would end up with like the coils would reach room temperature,

37:15.680 --> 37:18.880
but not necessarily hot enough to toast the bread.

37:20.240 --> 37:21.760
Possibly, potentially.

37:21.760 --> 37:22.560
I'm worried that-

37:22.560 --> 37:26.160
You're just talking out of your ass though, Mr. Wizard.

37:26.160 --> 37:28.720
Yeah, I'm worried in having this discussion we're ruining

37:28.720 --> 37:31.360
the new season of Bill Nye the Science Guy that's coming out.

37:31.360 --> 37:33.440
Like first, Bill's listening to this and he's like,

37:33.440 --> 37:34.880
fuck, that was like first episode.

37:34.880 --> 37:38.400
We're three quarters of the way through shooting.

37:38.400 --> 37:41.040
I don't think you could, okay.

37:41.040 --> 37:43.840
But you couldn't close the freezer all the way.

37:44.560 --> 37:45.520
So you're gonna have-

37:45.520 --> 37:48.960
I mean, it would seal around like a small thin enough cord.

37:48.960 --> 37:52.400
Like it was that like that seal thing that is on freezers.

37:52.400 --> 37:53.520
It would still seal around it.

37:53.520 --> 37:54.720
I don't think that's a factor.

37:54.720 --> 37:56.080
That's a fucking easy out, Justin.

37:56.080 --> 37:58.320
You try to fucking like cheat your way out of this question.

37:58.320 --> 37:59.520
What's gonna happen in there?

38:00.320 --> 38:04.800
Because I think we're worried about whether or not the bread's gonna turn into toast.

38:04.800 --> 38:09.120
I'm on some like, this is gonna be like we're inventing time travel.

38:09.120 --> 38:12.800
Like we're on some like accidental weird science Steins Gate shit.

38:12.800 --> 38:18.400
Like I'm worried that like it's gonna open up a black hole of temperature.

38:20.640 --> 38:22.560
I just don't think it'll get as toasty.

38:23.200 --> 38:25.280
Like it'll be less toasty toast, right?

38:27.280 --> 38:29.200
Probably less toasty I would think.

38:29.200 --> 38:29.600
Why does-

38:29.600 --> 38:32.080
Like warmed through, but not as toasty.

38:32.080 --> 38:33.600
Why does one of them win?

38:33.600 --> 38:37.520
Is like, because in your mind you're saying the freezer beats the toaster.

38:37.520 --> 38:38.000
Why?

38:38.000 --> 38:39.600
I think freezer beats toaster.

38:39.600 --> 38:42.240
It's bigger and it's been doing it for longer.

38:42.240 --> 38:46.720
Like I've been keeping things frozen in here for years.

38:46.720 --> 38:51.120
You cannot come into my house and try to toast things and expect it to fly.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.560
It's not gonna fly with me.

38:52.560 --> 38:54.320
I'll get colder if I have to.

38:54.320 --> 38:56.160
Okay Justin, what about this?

38:56.880 --> 39:01.840
Imagine if you will, we're gonna get into some, this is all mind puzzles and not real.

39:01.840 --> 39:02.640
Keep that in mind.

39:02.640 --> 39:03.600
I realize that we-

39:03.600 --> 39:05.040
It's real to me, damn it.

39:05.040 --> 39:07.600
Griffin, we're about to go on a flight of fancy.

39:07.600 --> 39:08.800
Fuck it, buckle in.

39:08.800 --> 39:09.520
Oh fucking shit.

39:09.520 --> 39:11.280
All right, Ms. Frizzle, take me.

39:11.280 --> 39:18.400
What if instead of toaster in freezer, we had a giant toaster that we put a freezer,

39:18.400 --> 39:20.240
a smaller freezer in.

39:20.240 --> 39:25.200
We started the toaster, would the freezer still keep things cold inside of it?

39:25.200 --> 39:28.000
That's a fucking banger of a question, Travis.

39:28.000 --> 39:36.000
Yes, because I posit that Justin is correct in a roundabout way, that if you put something

39:36.000 --> 39:41.440
inside another thing, the bigger thing containing it will always be dominant because it is bigger

39:41.440 --> 39:43.360
and containing the inner vessel.

39:43.360 --> 39:45.040
And it's been in the game for longer.

39:45.040 --> 39:46.800
I don't wanna discount Savvy.

39:48.080 --> 39:53.280
I feel like if you put a toaster in a, okay, if you put a freezer in a giant toaster,

39:53.280 --> 39:56.000
I feel like the freezer is still gonna get it done.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.440
But every time you use the toaster, the freezer is gonna be like, what the fuck?

40:00.000 --> 40:01.920
I just got it cold in here.

40:01.920 --> 40:06.560
And you ruined everything again and you refreeze it, you're definitely gonna get some ice crystals.

40:08.160 --> 40:09.920
That's gonna be a big problem.

40:10.720 --> 40:12.960
But I feel like the freezer won't give up.

40:12.960 --> 40:18.640
The freezer would never quit, always trying to get things cold again after the toaster

40:18.640 --> 40:20.960
did its thing.

40:20.960 --> 40:24.240
Is it possible that we get that cold, crunchy toast?

40:24.240 --> 40:28.880
Is it possible that this is just a new fucking molecular gastronomy thing where it's like,

40:28.880 --> 40:33.600
this toast isn't burned or cooked at all, but it's crunchy, but it's cold?

40:33.600 --> 40:37.840
It's crunch like toast, but cold like ice cream.

40:37.840 --> 40:46.640
If you toasted a toaster pastry, toaster strudel, it's got the hot filling and the

40:46.640 --> 40:52.720
hot flaky crust, but then immediately did a quick dip in some liquid nitrogen,

40:52.720 --> 40:59.120
would the inside remain molten hot while the outside was frozen?

40:59.120 --> 40:59.680
I think so.

41:00.560 --> 41:01.280
That would be a take.

41:01.280 --> 41:03.120
I would jam on that.

41:03.120 --> 41:08.400
I mean, I'd probably die because I think maybe the liquid nitrogen would be bad for my tum-tum.

41:08.400 --> 41:11.440
This reminds me of the scene in the brave old toaster where the brave old toaster went

41:11.440 --> 41:13.680
up to the freezer and was like, 1v1 me, motherfucker.

41:16.720 --> 41:18.560
Can I do a different?

41:18.560 --> 41:20.560
I didn't think that that yahoo was gonna have my new legs.

41:20.560 --> 41:21.840
And I also feel this way about this one.

41:21.840 --> 41:23.760
Can I do like a two for one?

41:23.760 --> 41:24.960
Yeah, two for one sale.

41:24.960 --> 41:27.600
This one was sent in by Rachel Rosen, game recognized game, Rachel Rosen.

41:27.600 --> 41:28.080
Thank you, Rachel.

41:28.080 --> 41:33.120
It's by yahoo answers user J who asks, in Italian cuisine,

41:34.000 --> 41:37.760
is it appropriate to mix two different types of pasta?

41:38.960 --> 41:42.480
I had lunch at a recently opened restaurant in my area and one of the pasta dishes I saw

41:42.480 --> 41:46.080
served to the table diagonally for me had both spaghetti and fessucine,

41:46.960 --> 41:50.480
maybe tagliatelle in white sauce with clams.

41:50.480 --> 41:51.600
I'm not sure what it's called.

41:51.600 --> 41:53.200
First thing that came to mind was, wow, that's different.

41:53.200 --> 41:53.920
But the more I think about it,

41:53.920 --> 41:56.800
mixing two types of pasta together doesn't sound right at all.

41:56.800 --> 41:58.800
To reiterate my question, in Italian cuisine,

41:58.800 --> 42:00.960
is it appropriate to mix two different types of pasta?

42:02.080 --> 42:04.080
I read this and I don't know how serious to talk about here,

42:04.080 --> 42:07.280
but I also imagined spaghetti macaroni together,

42:07.280 --> 42:09.440
just chilling together in a bowl with some sauce.

42:09.440 --> 42:14.000
And I was like, hey, that's the most wack shit I think I've ever heard of in my entire life.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.040
Yeah, good luck finding which fork to use.

42:17.040 --> 42:21.200
Because do I use my macaroni fork or do I use my linguini fork?

42:21.200 --> 42:22.800
I don't know.

42:22.800 --> 42:24.240
There's also different techniques.

42:24.240 --> 42:26.240
There's different pursuit techniques.

42:26.240 --> 42:26.880
Yeah, for sure.

42:27.600 --> 42:31.520
If you do the swirl, you know that big, silly swirl

42:31.520 --> 42:33.840
that people like to do where they do a big, silly swirl

42:33.840 --> 42:36.720
and then they put it on a spoon and eat it like that?

42:36.720 --> 42:37.760
That's one way of doing it.

42:37.760 --> 42:41.120
Like they made a Donald Duck style like, whoop, ow, whoop.

42:41.120 --> 42:44.080
Like they made a pasta nest that they're gonna roost in for a bit.

42:45.520 --> 42:50.480
You're not gonna get, you may get all macaroni, like singular.

42:50.480 --> 42:52.320
I don't know what the singular of macaroni is,

42:52.320 --> 42:54.320
but you might get one macaroni in there.

42:55.040 --> 42:59.360
You know, I would like to be in the kitchen of this restaurant

42:59.360 --> 43:02.080
where like the chef reached for the box of pasta or whatever

43:02.080 --> 43:04.160
and was like, ooh, there's not enough of this dish.

43:04.160 --> 43:06.880
And there was like a solid like five minute rushed,

43:07.760 --> 43:10.720
heated but whispered conversation about like,

43:10.720 --> 43:15.920
can we convince a customer that mixing two pastas is a thing

43:15.920 --> 43:20.000
and not just because we ran out of this kind of pasta halfway through the dish?

43:20.000 --> 43:24.640
It's like, yeah, I call this fettighetti, enjoy.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.360
I love Guy Fettighetti.

43:27.360 --> 43:29.840
I've been watching a lot of his stuff since we got cable.

43:32.080 --> 43:33.600
Now, exception to this,

43:34.960 --> 43:40.160
if we could somehow thread the most tender angel hair pasta

43:40.720 --> 43:42.720
through the juiciest macaroni noodles.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.200
Into a beautiful necklace.

43:45.200 --> 43:46.880
Into a beautiful edible necklace

43:46.880 --> 43:51.440
that we would serve to you on my, while I'm wearing it.

43:51.440 --> 43:52.880
And you would have to, it's the-

43:52.880 --> 43:54.080
On your friend's hairy body.

43:56.480 --> 43:58.400
This is my naked brother Griffin.

43:58.400 --> 44:00.080
I've coated him in chains.

44:00.080 --> 44:00.580
Hello.

44:02.080 --> 44:02.880
Thank you, Griffin.

44:02.880 --> 44:04.320
Griffin, I did ask you not to speak.

44:04.320 --> 44:05.520
Please, you'll move the noodles.

44:06.560 --> 44:10.640
I've layered him much like chain mail, but it's noodle mail.

44:10.640 --> 44:14.080
It's noodle mail armor where I've threaded lovingly,

44:14.080 --> 44:17.920
threaded spaghetti through the macaroni noodles

44:17.920 --> 44:20.480
and made him sort of an edible armor.

44:20.480 --> 44:25.600
So now he's just sort of a noodle boy for you to enjoy.

44:25.600 --> 44:26.400
Enjoy this noodle boy.

44:26.400 --> 44:27.520
I am working on a jingle.

44:28.960 --> 44:31.520
I don't have a tune yet, but it's coming along.

44:31.520 --> 44:33.360
Noodles and noodles on this beautiful boy.

44:33.360 --> 44:34.560
It's something like that.

44:34.560 --> 44:35.920
Just one moment, I'm all plain.

44:35.920 --> 44:36.960
I'm feeling a bit under the weather.

44:36.960 --> 44:38.720
Time to get a visit from the sauce doctor.

44:38.720 --> 44:40.720
And then the sauce doctor come and just dumps it on me.

44:41.280 --> 44:42.560
And then I'm ready to go.

44:42.560 --> 44:44.000
It's going to get messy, I say.

44:44.640 --> 44:49.920
See, I love this because this is both fitting in the most upscale Italian restaurant

44:49.920 --> 44:54.800
and also could double as like a Cirque du Soleil performance.

44:54.800 --> 44:58.000
So it's like it's a performance art right there at your table.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.400
People love that because sometimes it's a magician

45:00.400 --> 45:03.680
or sometimes it's like a fun band who like walks around the restaurant place.

45:03.680 --> 45:07.680
And sometimes it's a naked boy wearing macaroni mithril

45:07.680 --> 45:09.600
and you just eat it off of him.

45:09.600 --> 45:13.920
What's hard is, though, you know that eventually Griffin's going to get some job offers

45:13.920 --> 45:17.920
from somebody else, maybe Pasta Garden or Marty Scorsese,

45:17.920 --> 45:20.080
and he's going to have to quit and there's going to be a new boy.

45:20.080 --> 45:23.200
And everybody's going to say, I really like the flavors different,

45:23.200 --> 45:26.560
I think, off the new boy than the old one.

45:26.560 --> 45:28.560
I prefer the old noodle boy.

45:28.560 --> 45:30.320
I like noodle boy classic.

45:30.320 --> 45:40.240
The old noodle boy Griffin had almost like a Parmesan grime.

45:40.240 --> 45:42.240
So I guess I'm a little bit disappointed.

45:43.120 --> 45:44.560
I'm so excited about this question.

45:44.560 --> 45:44.880
Please.

45:45.440 --> 45:48.240
The other day I was spending quality time with one of my best friends

45:48.960 --> 45:52.400
when he mentioned that he was starting to cook breakfast for himself.

45:52.400 --> 45:56.160
This was fine, but the way he said it struck me as odd.

45:56.160 --> 45:59.760
Fuck, I've been frying eggs instead of just having cereal.

46:00.640 --> 46:02.480
Yeah, but cereal is good, I replied.

46:03.360 --> 46:04.160
I do like it.

46:05.040 --> 46:07.840
Nothing beats a nice warm bowl of cereal.

46:09.600 --> 46:15.600
I inquired further and ascertained that he has been microwaving the milk

46:15.600 --> 46:20.720
for his normal breakfast cereal his entire life.

46:21.360 --> 46:21.760
What?

46:22.320 --> 46:23.200
Help.

46:23.200 --> 46:24.160
Am I good?

46:24.160 --> 46:26.880
Am I good? And that's from Toasty in Toledo.

46:26.880 --> 46:29.440
I love that this person recognizes this is such a breach of trust

46:29.440 --> 46:31.680
that they are curious if they are good.

46:31.680 --> 46:33.840
They are good, if they are good by association.

46:34.400 --> 46:36.480
The answer is no, obviously.

46:36.480 --> 46:37.360
You are ruined.

46:38.480 --> 46:41.280
What could you have be-

46:41.280 --> 46:41.840
What?

46:41.840 --> 46:43.600
Who did this to you?

46:43.600 --> 46:45.920
Who hurt you back in the day?

46:45.920 --> 46:47.520
Someone did this to you as a child.

46:47.520 --> 46:49.360
I'll tell you who did it to them as a child.

46:49.360 --> 46:50.480
Fucking Cocoa Weeds.

46:51.440 --> 46:53.600
Cocoa Weeds did their dark things and they're like,

46:53.600 --> 46:55.440
this is gonna be your jam.

46:55.440 --> 46:56.880
It's like cereal, but hot.

46:56.880 --> 46:59.680
It could also just be oatmeal, like oatmeal in general.

46:59.680 --> 47:02.160
They're like, this is good, but what if checks?

47:02.160 --> 47:04.560
No, nah, nah.

47:04.560 --> 47:06.560
They do it with Grape Nuts.

47:06.560 --> 47:10.160
People will sell you this on Grape Nuts where if you heat it up,

47:10.160 --> 47:13.040
it's just, I mean, hi, is Justin here?

47:13.040 --> 47:16.480
If you pour milk on Grape Nuts and heat it up, that's gruel.

47:16.480 --> 47:18.160
That's gruel that you make at home.

47:18.160 --> 47:20.240
It's not just sad.

47:20.240 --> 47:21.200
It's just sad.

47:21.200 --> 47:24.400
You're having Grape Nuts and it's time to spice it up for yourself.

47:25.760 --> 47:27.680
Just sit down and eat it as quickly as you can

47:27.680 --> 47:28.720
and move on with your day.

47:28.720 --> 47:30.320
The reason that Grape Nuts tells you to do that

47:30.320 --> 47:32.160
is because maybe you'll heat the milk up too much

47:32.160 --> 47:33.920
and burn your tongue so bad that you don't realize

47:33.920 --> 47:36.080
how fucking shitty Grape Nuts taste.

47:36.080 --> 47:37.600
That's why they tell you to do that.

47:37.600 --> 47:40.000
The fact that you are doing this to Cinnamon Toast Crunch

47:40.000 --> 47:42.560
when I could eat the Cinnamon Toast Crunch with a cold milk

47:42.560 --> 47:44.000
makes you so angry.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.160
Do you know, this falls into a category,

47:46.160 --> 47:47.280
it's a very slim category,

47:47.280 --> 47:48.800
but a category of like breakfast

47:48.800 --> 47:50.800
that then asks you to take one more step.

47:50.800 --> 47:53.280
Like before Frosted Mini Wheats were mini

47:53.280 --> 47:54.880
and it was just one giant wheat

47:54.880 --> 47:57.360
that you yourself were supposed to break up.

47:57.360 --> 48:00.880
Like, no, the process is pour milk, eat.

48:00.880 --> 48:03.600
There is no other step in the middle of this.

48:03.600 --> 48:06.160
Now that is still how shredded wheat is distributed.

48:06.160 --> 48:07.520
Yes, I will, I will.

48:07.520 --> 48:08.160
I hate it.

48:09.680 --> 48:10.480
I agree with you.

48:10.480 --> 48:12.480
Also, I think people eat shredded wheat hot.

48:12.480 --> 48:14.320
I think that's another thing that people are doing.

48:14.320 --> 48:14.800
I'd fuck with that.

48:14.800 --> 48:15.520
I'd get down with that.

48:15.520 --> 48:15.680
Yeah, I think so.

48:15.680 --> 48:17.440
And I actually like the hot Grape Nuts too.

48:17.440 --> 48:20.560
You have just added a second,

48:20.560 --> 48:23.360
you have shred the wheat yourself and then heat it.

48:23.360 --> 48:26.800
That's two more steps in what it's supposed to be a,

48:26.800 --> 48:28.640
oh no, I've only got two minutes

48:28.640 --> 48:30.480
before the carpool gets here.

48:30.480 --> 48:33.440
Like milk cereal, done, out the door.

48:34.880 --> 48:37.120
I think I could get behind this

48:37.120 --> 48:40.240
under the shredded wheats clause.

48:40.240 --> 48:43.360
But also if you worked at like,

48:44.160 --> 48:47.280
if you were like a construction worker in Buffalo,

48:47.280 --> 48:48.880
and like you showed up to the site

48:48.880 --> 48:51.120
and they were like, hey, Denny, what are you eating today?

48:51.120 --> 48:53.920
And you were like, I'm having some hot rings.

48:53.920 --> 48:54.880
And they're like, hot rings?

48:54.880 --> 48:55.600
What are those?

48:55.600 --> 48:57.680
I heated up my Cheerio milk

48:57.680 --> 48:59.120
and you slobber it out of the thing

48:59.120 --> 49:00.880
on a cool blustery winter day.

49:00.880 --> 49:02.960
I think that that would be acceptable.

49:02.960 --> 49:06.240
Hot rings for a construction worker is acceptable in Buffalo,

49:06.240 --> 49:08.240
but that's about, that's basically it.

49:08.240 --> 49:10.320
Otherwise, I don't want to hear about your hot Cheerios.

49:11.200 --> 49:13.040
That's sort of like the first time

49:13.040 --> 49:14.880
I tried to make warm milk for myself

49:14.880 --> 49:17.200
because I'd been sold that as a sleep aid.

49:17.200 --> 49:19.600
And then I tried to drink it with my own mouth.

49:19.600 --> 49:23.120
And it's absolutely repellent.

49:23.120 --> 49:25.920
And the fact that you would bring something like that

49:25.920 --> 49:28.560
into the blessed bond of cereal and cold milk

49:28.560 --> 49:32.000
is honestly hugely offensive to me.

49:32.000 --> 49:33.280
It's hugely offensive.

49:33.280 --> 49:35.600
Can I read another question that makes me really happy?

49:35.600 --> 49:37.600
And as we near the end of February,

49:37.600 --> 49:39.760
the February question list will fall off.

49:39.760 --> 49:42.000
And I just want to say this out loud.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.600
I want to put this out in the world.

49:43.600 --> 49:44.960
We don't even have to discuss it so much.

49:44.960 --> 49:46.960
Yeah, secret the shit.

49:46.960 --> 49:49.680
Today, as I was painting sets for the school play,

49:49.680 --> 49:51.760
my drama teacher came in to get a can of paint

49:51.760 --> 49:53.440
and spilled it all over the floor.

49:53.440 --> 49:58.240
She then said, ugh, this makes me so mad I could bust a nut.

50:00.800 --> 50:02.960
I think she thinks bust a nut

50:02.960 --> 50:05.600
is an angry version of the phrase bust a gut.

50:05.600 --> 50:05.920
It is?

50:06.560 --> 50:10.080
I told her to never say that phrase ever again,

50:10.080 --> 50:13.760
but she just laughed and took it as old people

50:13.760 --> 50:15.760
like you shouldn't use slang.

50:15.760 --> 50:19.040
My question is, how do I make my 60 year old teacher

50:19.040 --> 50:21.600
never say bust a nut ever again

50:21.600 --> 50:24.080
without having to explain to her what it means?

50:24.080 --> 50:26.640
And that's from, and I still have to clean up the paint.

50:27.440 --> 50:29.120
There's a typo in this.

50:29.120 --> 50:32.880
And I believe the typo is when you said don't.

50:32.880 --> 50:33.280
Yeah.

50:33.280 --> 50:36.880
And instead, as much as humanly fucking possible,

50:36.880 --> 50:39.840
get your 60 year old teacher to say bust a nut.

50:39.840 --> 50:43.840
This woman is a walking story.

50:43.840 --> 50:47.920
She is a walking story that she gifts to people

50:47.920 --> 50:51.360
who are around when she does something that makes her angry

50:51.360 --> 50:54.480
and she says the bad, wrong, very, very funny, good thing.

50:54.480 --> 50:58.480
Assumedly, assumedly, she's using the wrong thing.

50:58.480 --> 51:01.360
And it is very selfish of you to say,

51:01.360 --> 51:04.080
I would like to be the last recipient of this story

51:04.080 --> 51:06.000
because we might get another question.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.480
We've probably gotten questions about this very person before.

51:09.600 --> 51:12.240
You don't wanna be the person that brings that story to an end.

51:12.240 --> 51:15.840
And you are also in a position where in the middle of class

51:15.840 --> 51:18.560
you could get into a fake fight with somebody and yell,

51:19.280 --> 51:20.320
one more word out of you

51:20.320 --> 51:22.800
and I am gonna bust a nut in this place.

51:22.800 --> 51:25.280
And your teacher would just be lolling.

51:25.280 --> 51:26.960
Like your teacher would be loving it.

51:26.960 --> 51:28.880
And everyone would look at you.

51:28.880 --> 51:30.880
Miss Stevens is cool as shit.

51:30.880 --> 51:32.480
She's just laughing this off.

51:32.480 --> 51:32.880
Yeah.

51:32.880 --> 51:35.520
I thought she'd give him a pink slip, but no dice.

51:35.520 --> 51:36.800
She's loving it.

51:37.840 --> 51:39.920
Maybe we should all talk about busting a nut.

51:39.920 --> 51:41.360
And now it's a thing.

51:41.360 --> 51:44.160
That's the thing is now you have the opportunity to like

51:44.160 --> 51:46.800
the next time you get mad with a group of friends say,

51:47.440 --> 51:49.360
this is making me so mad I could bust a nut.

51:49.360 --> 51:51.600
And everyone says, excuse me, what?

51:51.600 --> 51:51.920
Sorry?

51:51.920 --> 51:54.880
And then you say, ah, okay, thank you for inquiring.

51:54.880 --> 51:56.400
And then you tell them the story.

51:56.400 --> 52:01.120
And now this is weird because you can travel back in time

52:01.120 --> 52:05.040
to make this phrase make sense the way she's using it.

52:05.040 --> 52:07.440
Because now you're gonna start this and in 20 years

52:07.440 --> 52:11.600
people will be using bust a nut to describe how mad they are.

52:11.600 --> 52:12.960
And she started that.

52:13.520 --> 52:17.360
Are you suggesting this person could tort the fabric

52:17.360 --> 52:20.560
of language around this person rather than correct them?

52:20.560 --> 52:21.520
Inception.

52:21.520 --> 52:23.840
This is inception to busting a nut.

52:24.480 --> 52:26.320
So it all just comes back around.

52:26.320 --> 52:30.000
You do this nut busting chuckle routine for like a month.

52:30.560 --> 52:32.960
And like a month later in that drama class,

52:32.960 --> 52:37.040
your friend Derek is like, man, I'm so frustrated over here.

52:37.040 --> 52:38.240
I'm about to jizz.

52:38.240 --> 52:41.920
And your teacher's like, Derek, leave principal's office now.

52:41.920 --> 52:43.440
We don't use words like that.

52:43.440 --> 52:45.440
No, no.

52:45.440 --> 52:46.880
We don't say jizz in this class.

52:46.880 --> 52:47.840
We don't say jizz.

52:47.840 --> 52:48.880
You've made me so frustrated.

52:48.880 --> 52:51.200
I'm about to seriously bust a nut right here.

52:53.840 --> 52:55.360
What if you confronted your teacher

52:55.360 --> 53:00.320
if I was like, Ms. Stevens, bust a nut means,

53:00.320 --> 53:02.160
if she's like, I know exactly what it means.

53:02.160 --> 53:03.600
Hilarious, right?

53:03.600 --> 53:04.240
It's good, right?

53:04.240 --> 53:04.800
Oh, shit.

53:04.800 --> 53:05.300
Oh, shit.

53:07.120 --> 53:08.800
Ms. Stevens is funny as fuck.

53:10.320 --> 53:11.280
Oh, my God.

53:11.280 --> 53:12.640
I can't wait to be 60 now.

53:12.640 --> 53:14.240
I'm going to run this con on everybody.

53:15.840 --> 53:17.120
Oh, she doesn't know.

53:17.120 --> 53:18.000
Oh, I know.

53:18.000 --> 53:18.640
Oh, I know.

53:18.640 --> 53:19.440
Oh, I know.

53:19.440 --> 53:20.480
I've always known.

53:20.480 --> 53:21.600
I've always known.

53:22.240 --> 53:22.880
Inception.

53:23.440 --> 53:24.720
What a good teacher.

53:24.720 --> 53:26.080
What a good time.

53:26.080 --> 53:27.040
What a great teacher.

53:27.040 --> 53:27.520
I remember-

53:27.520 --> 53:28.320
What a great teacher.

53:28.880 --> 53:30.240
Thank you for meeting me, President Obama.

53:30.240 --> 53:31.920
I was wondering if you could call my favorite teacher.

53:31.920 --> 53:35.280
It would be very, it would be very special to her.

53:35.280 --> 53:35.840
If you could just give her-

53:35.840 --> 53:36.000
Sure.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.320
What kind of impact did she have on your life?

53:38.320 --> 53:38.560
Well-

53:38.560 --> 53:38.720
All right.

53:38.720 --> 53:39.600
So check this shit out.

53:41.440 --> 53:41.680
Okay.

53:41.680 --> 53:42.320
Get Joey in here.

53:42.320 --> 53:42.960
He's going to love this.

53:46.160 --> 53:46.560
Whatever.

53:46.560 --> 53:47.760
Joey's the one that convinced her.

53:48.800 --> 53:51.280
Joey comes in, he's like, yeah, bust a nut means you're angry, right?

53:52.080 --> 53:52.580
Joey.

53:53.120 --> 53:53.920
Yeah, you got me.

53:53.920 --> 53:56.000
I, by the way, I just want everybody to know,

53:56.000 --> 53:58.480
I'm not going to die on this nut busting cross

53:58.480 --> 54:01.360
to change the language, to contort around your teacher.

54:01.360 --> 54:03.200
I will not give up busting nut.

54:04.480 --> 54:05.520
No, it's an important phrase for what it means.

54:05.520 --> 54:09.680
Justin, your obstinance is making me so angry I could bust a nut.

54:10.480 --> 54:11.280
Don't stop.

54:11.280 --> 54:12.480
Like, don't do it.

54:12.480 --> 54:13.840
Because what you're going to do

54:13.840 --> 54:16.720
is this will not extend beyond our community.

54:16.720 --> 54:17.040
Yeah.

54:17.040 --> 54:19.520
And we're just going to lose the ability to tell

54:19.520 --> 54:21.360
whether people are angry or horny.

54:21.360 --> 54:24.960
Yeah, that's true.

54:24.960 --> 54:25.840
Or both.

54:25.840 --> 54:27.280
Or both in some cases.

54:27.280 --> 54:29.040
That's going to do it for us, I think.

54:29.040 --> 54:30.160
Yeah, we're done.

54:30.160 --> 54:32.160
That's the end of this podcast for this week.

54:32.720 --> 54:35.440
All right, so this is our big pitch, okay?

54:36.320 --> 54:41.840
If you like us at all, we've got a TV show coming out on CISO,

54:41.840 --> 54:44.400
which is a comedy streaming service run by NBC.

54:46.560 --> 54:50.000
At CISO.com is where you can sign up and what all.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.640
But there is also an Apple TV app.

54:52.640 --> 54:53.680
There's a Roku app.

54:53.680 --> 54:55.040
There's a iOS app.

54:57.040 --> 54:58.080
It is US only.

54:58.080 --> 55:02.240
But if you could just go ahead and go watch our TV show,

55:02.240 --> 55:03.920
it comes out February 23rd.

55:04.480 --> 55:08.320
And we would really appreciate it.

55:08.320 --> 55:09.360
We think you'll like it.

55:09.360 --> 55:12.400
We also just, we have a ton of people on our Facebook group.

55:12.400 --> 55:16.640
We have a spin-off Facebook page for specifics

55:16.640 --> 55:19.200
about the TV show because not everybody can watch it yet.

55:19.200 --> 55:20.960
We don't want to spoil anything or what have you.

55:20.960 --> 55:24.960
So if you search for MBMBAM TV show,

55:24.960 --> 55:27.280
I think it pops up there on the book.

55:27.280 --> 55:30.080
So you can sign up for that if you want to talk about the show.

55:30.080 --> 55:33.200
And just to clarify, because we made that TV show thing,

55:33.200 --> 55:38.560
so if you try to post stuff about the TV show

55:38.560 --> 55:41.520
on the regular podcast group, it's gonna get denied.

55:42.560 --> 55:44.160
We want to make sure that we keep that-

55:44.160 --> 55:45.120
Specific stuff.

55:45.120 --> 55:48.240
Specific stuff about the episodes that are going up.

55:48.880 --> 55:49.920
Maybe not more general things.

55:49.920 --> 55:52.400
But I just also want to say,

55:52.400 --> 55:56.480
the absolute fact of the matter is

55:56.480 --> 56:00.080
we would not have had this opportunity

56:00.080 --> 56:01.360
if it weren't for you all

56:02.640 --> 56:04.480
over the past almost seven years,

56:05.280 --> 56:06.400
spreading the word about the show,

56:06.400 --> 56:08.880
listening to the show, reviewing the show, all that stuff.

56:09.440 --> 56:11.440
And we really owe it to you

56:11.440 --> 56:12.880
and we'll be forever indebted to you.

56:12.880 --> 56:16.560
And we hope we made something that will delight you

56:16.560 --> 56:20.720
because that was the absolute 100% only ideal

56:20.720 --> 56:22.400
that we had in mind when we were making the show.

56:22.400 --> 56:24.880
So thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

56:24.880 --> 56:25.380
Thank you.

56:27.200 --> 56:30.880
And just as a reminder, I also want to say the mods,

56:32.560 --> 56:39.360
Rachel and Wes and Anthony and Lucy and Stormy,

56:40.160 --> 56:42.880
who are mods on the podcast group

56:42.880 --> 56:44.880
are also the mods on the TV show group.

56:45.600 --> 56:46.960
And they're working really hard,

56:46.960 --> 56:51.200
but it takes a while to sort through all the membership requests

56:51.200 --> 56:52.640
because we want to make sure that we keep,

56:54.160 --> 56:56.480
that we don't get spam accounts in there and everything.

56:56.480 --> 56:59.200
And they also work really hard to sort through everybody's posts

56:59.200 --> 57:00.240
and it can take a while.

57:01.040 --> 57:04.320
And we've given them fairly specific guidelines

57:04.320 --> 57:06.960
as far as like what kind of stuff should be approved

57:06.960 --> 57:07.680
and what shouldn't.

57:07.680 --> 57:11.840
So just know it can be, you might have to wait a while.

57:11.840 --> 57:13.120
A post might get denied.

57:13.120 --> 57:14.480
Yeah, please be patient with them.

57:14.480 --> 57:17.440
Please be patient with them, they're working really, really hard

57:17.440 --> 57:19.440
and it is a completely thankless job.

57:20.160 --> 57:21.280
But we sure appreciate it.

57:21.280 --> 57:22.640
Like we literally don't thank them.

57:22.640 --> 57:23.840
Yeah, not at all.

57:23.840 --> 57:25.280
I thank you all very much.

57:26.320 --> 57:27.840
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

57:27.840 --> 57:28.560
for using our theme song.

57:28.560 --> 57:30.560
It's a part drop the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

57:30.560 --> 57:31.920
It's also the theme song for the TV show.

57:31.920 --> 57:34.480
I saw a lot of people like excited that we got to use it

57:34.480 --> 57:38.160
for the TV show when the premiere episode came out.

57:39.040 --> 57:40.720
And we were super excited too,

57:40.720 --> 57:42.080
because like it would have been weird if I'm like,

57:42.080 --> 57:48.000
and now I'm a bim bam bing bing bing bing bing bing bing.

57:48.000 --> 57:49.120
Like some shitty song.

57:49.120 --> 57:51.760
That was what I think a shitty song sounds like.

57:51.760 --> 57:53.040
Although really it was kind of a banger.

57:53.040 --> 57:54.880
Like it hadn't like a nice sort of-

57:54.880 --> 57:55.360
That was good.

57:55.360 --> 57:55.920
It wasn't bad.

57:55.920 --> 57:56.160
Yeah.

57:56.880 --> 57:58.560
It was polyphonic spree level right there.

57:59.440 --> 58:02.480
So we have a live show in Austin in May.

58:02.480 --> 58:02.980
Oh, geez.

58:03.680 --> 58:04.800
May, what is it?

58:04.800 --> 58:05.440
What day?

58:05.440 --> 58:06.000
What are we doing?

58:06.560 --> 58:07.760
I think 20th and 21st.

58:07.760 --> 58:08.480
Is that right?

58:08.480 --> 58:09.280
Yeah, that sounds right.

58:09.280 --> 58:10.080
Nobody's really quite sure.

58:10.720 --> 58:11.520
No one knows when.

58:11.520 --> 58:13.680
But so May, I believe it's May 20th and 21st.

58:13.680 --> 58:14.000
It is.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.320
Saturday the 20th and Sunday the 21st.

58:17.680 --> 58:20.480
And those tickets are going on sale this week.

58:21.760 --> 58:23.680
You know, I know that-

58:25.120 --> 58:28.480

58:28.480 --> 58:31.200
But just in case, make sure, you know,

58:31.200 --> 58:32.640

59:10.080 --> 59:13.520
That's the time zone our brother lives in, that Austin exists in.

59:13.520 --> 59:16.160

59:16.160 --> 59:18.320

59:19.920 --> 59:25.200
They're going to go on sale Friday the 24th, 10 a.m. Central Time.

59:26.800 --> 59:31.120

Thank you, Paige.

59:44.400 --> 59:46.000
It's Yahoo Answers user.

59:46.000 --> 59:50.800
Another anonymous, we'll call him Hieronymous, asks,

59:52.880 --> 59:58.000
is it immature when a guy says penis power during sex?

59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.760
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:02.960
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:04.400
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.520
It's been my brother, my brother, me.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:06.160
Kiss your dads.

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:32.080
Square on the lips.

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:37.520
We host the weekly comedy podcast One Bad Mother, we celebrate our moments of parenting genius,

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:39.200
as well as our failures.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:41.280
Just like, we're going to have hot dogs.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.120
And I'm like, no, we're having fun.

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:44.400
Everybody loves hot dogs.

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.320
And it just like smashes that thing right on my chest.

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:49.360
And then I'm just crying in the middle of like kids space while people are like literally

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.560
dancing with their children.

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:54.320
Parenting can be sad and painfully funny at the same time.

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:59.280
So join us each week as we admit that this is hard, but we're getting really good at it.
