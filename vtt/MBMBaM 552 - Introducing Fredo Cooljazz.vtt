T-bird car that's gonna be in a lot of the scenes now and oh is it like a

01:48.400 --> 01:55.680
character all its own yeah it's a and it takes place in New York City and yeah

01:55.680 --> 01:59.080
and it's that's also kind of a character so you just heard our new theme song

01:59.080 --> 02:04.080
it's called my life is better with you by Montaigne who is a very talented

02:04.080 --> 02:08.960
artist who you should seek out immediately love to get her in on the

02:08.960 --> 02:12.320
show it would be cool if we could get her on the show in the next like 28

02:12.320 --> 02:18.960
minutes question comes along yeah yeah like later this episode yeah we'll see

02:18.960 --> 02:24.600
yeah yeah it's maybe in the works it's wild it's it's wild enough to me that we

02:24.600 --> 02:29.680
know somebody who's competing on Eurovision let alone that we have now

02:29.680 --> 02:35.640
worked with somebody and will now be on a weekly basis sort of you know played

02:35.640 --> 02:39.600
on by somebody who's gonna be on your vision and do you think that means we

02:39.600 --> 02:45.200
can go to Eurovision ticks can we get can we compete will we be able to leave

02:45.200 --> 02:52.280
our nation is that is a huge question in America we join Europe can we read

02:52.280 --> 02:57.440
sub in sub in the UK's out that's fine sub us in baby I mean if they're

02:57.440 --> 03:03.040
including Australia I'm just saying we're ready why not America let me we'll

03:03.040 --> 03:07.800
start out by doing we'll infiltrate some backup dancers for some of the other for

03:07.800 --> 03:11.640
some of the smaller countries that don't really have a shot and I feel like we'd

03:11.640 --> 03:17.240
really blend in with like say uh-huh let me think maybe like France France yeah I

03:17.240 --> 03:21.320
think we could get in there and get like experimental with it and then we'll take

03:21.320 --> 03:26.640
off our masks at the end and be like it's us America and we can do it and we

03:26.640 --> 03:32.320
can hang out too yeah and oh what's that we're building bridges both figuratively

03:32.320 --> 03:37.880
and literally across the Atlantic Ocean yeah oh man you are so cool where's that

03:37.880 --> 03:44.440
bridge thank you come on thank you it's 2021 let's build a bridge across the

03:44.440 --> 03:55.360
ocean or under the ocean this is what I'm saying rich to Europe back to us

03:55.360 --> 04:00.360
drive in your car you'll go very far hope it don't collapse actually it's a

04:00.360 --> 04:07.240
walking it's a it's a walking it's like one of those escalator ground escalator

04:07.240 --> 04:12.240
things you just kind of stand on it and you start a little life down there and

04:12.240 --> 04:20.040
then like a month and a half later good good evening governor oh you're on the

04:20.040 --> 04:24.120
other side here that's means you're on the other side and then we can change it

04:24.120 --> 04:28.520
to like oh yeah under the pond and that's what we'll say across the pond

04:28.520 --> 04:32.640
it's like oh I came under the pond in the tube and they're like on the subway

04:32.640 --> 04:37.120
you're like no in the tube there's a tube it's about like three feet wide and

04:37.120 --> 04:42.040
like six and a half feet tall it's very tight very dark do you know there's a

04:42.040 --> 04:46.960
special British RSS feed of this show that just has content warnings but in

04:46.960 --> 04:52.600
front of every episode everyone the people in Eurovision who are responsible

04:52.600 --> 04:55.720
for Eurovision are gonna listen to the last two and a half minutes of this show

04:55.720 --> 05:01.360
and say damn not yet they ain't ready yet to be called I feel like in three

05:01.360 --> 05:06.760
minutes we started to establish new bonds and separate them violently oh boy

05:06.760 --> 05:11.480
oh boy we should build the bridge over the Atlantic Ocean and then set fire to

05:11.480 --> 05:16.560
it as we're driving in the last golden spike I love it hey can we do our show I

05:16.560 --> 05:21.160
would love that actually that would be fantastic that would be cool yeah I feel

05:21.160 --> 05:24.440
like we haven't done it in a while you know what I mean like I don't think we

05:24.440 --> 05:29.440
answered any questions last week yeah did we not I don't know it got rowdy we

05:29.440 --> 05:36.160
talked about here's a regular one okay oh my wife and I had our first baby last

05:36.160 --> 05:42.640
year a girl she's now ten months old my father-in-law bought her a gift and he's

05:42.640 --> 05:46.640
very excited to see her playing with the problem is it's clearly labeled a dog

05:46.640 --> 05:52.200
toy oh yeah tag the tag say to keep it away from babies he ordered it online so

05:52.200 --> 05:55.400
he may not have noticed this how do I navigate this without hurting his

05:55.400 --> 05:58.520
feelings I can't tell him that he actually bought our daughter a dog toy

05:58.520 --> 06:04.640
but I also don't want her to play with a dog toy helicopter parent am I right

06:04.640 --> 06:09.440
yeah really and I'm free in California I like the ones where they set it up so

06:09.440 --> 06:13.240
that there is no writing here there's two things that could happen both are

06:13.240 --> 06:20.080
bad yeah so I've lived this we we were killing time at some strip mall

06:20.080 --> 06:24.000
somewhere with Henry and he picked up a dog toy at a pet land we were just kind

06:24.000 --> 06:27.200
of walking around cuz we thought hey maybe he'll look at fish and be

06:27.200 --> 06:31.780
distracted for a little bit and he picked up a little little squishy dog

06:31.780 --> 06:37.840
toy and enjoyed it and we took a picture must post it online and then my my my

06:37.840 --> 06:43.760
mother and father-in-law sent that toy for Henry and he was like fuck yeah and

06:43.760 --> 06:46.960
started to play with it and then we looked at the tag later like this is kid

06:46.960 --> 06:53.640
poison this is this dogs love it kids hate it kids bodies hate it dogs bodies

06:53.640 --> 06:58.320
can withstand it but don't let a child put this in his mouth whatever you do

06:58.320 --> 07:02.800
whatever you do don't do that so what we did is we immediately took the toy away

07:02.800 --> 07:08.240
and we told the parents and we said hey this is funny you got our human child a

07:08.240 --> 07:12.400
dog toy and then we all had a good laugh about it and it was a mistake that was

07:12.400 --> 07:18.880
never made again so really you gotta say something but make it fun be like you

07:18.880 --> 07:23.520
poisoned my child that can be fun and then it's like they're not gonna feel

07:23.520 --> 07:27.280
bad cuz it's like a funny joke what kind of toy is it cuz if he got her a

07:27.280 --> 07:31.960
Nylabone it might be on purpose maybe he's just being really mean god I hate

07:31.960 --> 07:36.760
brushing my son's teeth if I could just toss a Nylabone in there and let that

07:36.760 --> 07:43.360
do the work enjoy that would be cool the kids don't appreciate if you've never

07:43.360 --> 07:46.800
tried to brush the teeth of a human that does not want their teeth brush yeah

07:46.800 --> 07:52.840
that is the one any place where kids can flex nuts they absolutely will right and

07:52.840 --> 07:57.360
this is the one place where kids will can absolutely flex nuts on you and they

07:57.360 --> 08:01.960
do every single fucking time yeah if you ever want to feel powerless be brushing

08:01.960 --> 08:07.680
a kid's teeth and have them bite down on you're done and I can't pull on it

08:07.680 --> 08:12.040
without some like marathon man bullshit that's gonna have you staring into the

08:12.040 --> 08:15.960
mirror for the next two hours like questioning who you your very soul yeah

08:15.960 --> 08:20.200
like there's no play you just let go of it at that point yeah all right

08:20.200 --> 08:23.680
you let your teeth fall out they don't need those teeth anyway that's what I'm

08:23.680 --> 08:27.640
saying that's why it's kind of hard we took BB to the dentist you know when it

08:27.640 --> 08:30.280
was time cuz we're good parents or whatever and they're like yeah you got

08:30.280 --> 08:34.200
to start flossing and I could think it's like ooh I don't know I'll bring her

08:34.200 --> 08:40.800
back my friend how often can I bring her in yeah if we just chuck a bone in there

08:40.800 --> 08:45.960
and let the bone do the brushing it's weird that there's not a child we got

08:45.960 --> 08:51.680
that we got that we got that tech for dogs but I don't have that tech for

08:51.680 --> 08:56.080
toddlers that's hey science how's your priorities pretty fucking bad I think

08:56.080 --> 09:01.520
yeah actually thank you also a squeaker inside those things they'd love that I

09:01.520 --> 09:05.740
would love that I'm just saying that I bought BB a lot of stuffed animals and

09:05.740 --> 09:09.420
now dot a lot of stuffed animals and very few of them have like tough tech

09:09.420 --> 09:13.880
technology that let him really rag doll him around to get that squeaker out I'm

09:13.880 --> 09:17.680
just saying let's keep our kids a little busier and maybe make those true toys

09:17.680 --> 09:22.560
last a little bit longer for the kids okay yeah um hey you wanna Yahoo yes

09:22.560 --> 09:26.640
this one was sent in by several people thank you everybody it's extremely

09:26.640 --> 09:31.320
unhelpful answer by the way yeah yeah no yeah do tell them I'm telling you I

09:31.320 --> 09:37.440
lived this and I got through okay and it's fun so thank you everybody who sent

09:37.440 --> 09:42.080
this in it's yahoo answers user Natalie who asks shipping a horse from Canada

09:42.080 --> 09:47.520
to Australia I want to transport my horse from Canada to Australia in a few

09:47.520 --> 09:52.160
years he is a gelding and at that time will be for is this dangerous to do can

09:52.160 --> 09:57.240
he get sick for it how much will it cost about has anyone else done this that can

09:57.240 --> 10:01.440
give please give me some information on this what are some good company that can

10:01.440 --> 10:07.920
do this via ship or by air that can give me a quote gotta get is it and let's go

10:07.920 --> 10:12.760
ahead and just say operation Dumbo drop out loud yeah and then we can move on to

10:12.760 --> 10:22.140
like more creative waters okay I'm on a plane yeah now that that's out of the

10:22.140 --> 10:29.040
way here's the problem I can think of so many ways to get a horse from Canada to

10:29.040 --> 10:36.480
Australia yeah if they can be dead at the oh at the end of oh at the end of it

10:36.480 --> 10:40.800
right well I guess the other way around wouldn't work would the other way around

10:40.800 --> 10:46.280
you know some like powerful magic unless you kill the horse ship it left ways

10:46.280 --> 10:51.720
over the international date line it shows up in Australia feeling Hale and

10:51.720 --> 10:56.280
Hardy no that would be tomorrow fuck no still dead dead for a day it might

10:56.280 --> 11:00.920
actually be easier to shoot the horse up into the sky in a rocket let the earth

11:00.920 --> 11:07.520
rotate underneath it rocket come back down oh cool and land in Australia if it

11:07.520 --> 11:11.560
goes might be easier and we could really interstellar it and launch around old

11:11.560 --> 11:15.200
Jupiter up in the sky and have a cut slingshot all the way back and when it

11:15.200 --> 11:20.360
comes back we have it's been ten years on earth but for the horse it's been

11:20.360 --> 11:27.920
like nine years and like 11 months and it's still a lot of time it's pretty

11:27.920 --> 11:31.960
it's pretty you would need to go how many seats would you have to buy on a

11:31.960 --> 11:37.560
plane oh to go with before they let you take the horse on yeah carry on horse

11:37.560 --> 11:45.240
yeah I've seen okay for reference yeah I once saw a large pitbull yeah that was

11:45.240 --> 11:49.240
like a rescue animal that had been trained to be like an assistive animal

11:49.240 --> 11:56.920
right and he I would put him at probably 80 pounds that's a little horse that's

11:56.920 --> 11:59.840
this is what I'm saying so if we scale that up that was like one seat right

11:59.840 --> 12:04.180
right so horse is what like 800 pounds that's 10 seats there's gonna be a

12:04.180 --> 12:07.880
four-year-old horse so we're not talking about a little full straight out the out

12:07.880 --> 12:14.120
the gate I'm checking the pet travel page on Delta okay and just control F

12:14.120 --> 12:21.120
horse some pets can travel with Delta as a carry-on shipped as very special

12:21.120 --> 12:25.560
cargo depending on their size okay review the requirements okay I'm

12:25.560 --> 12:31.960
checking the guidelines and requirements okay yeah there's a section here on

12:31.960 --> 12:36.920
inappropriate animal behavior so all rude dogs need not apply oh no not this

12:36.920 --> 12:43.080
this ponies are real saint it's this ponies a fucking gentleman one of the

12:43.080 --> 12:47.320
inappropriate animal behaviors is barking excessively not in response to

12:47.320 --> 12:52.400
a handler's needs or distress yeah I want to I did listen it does that dog

12:52.400 --> 12:57.720
sense distress because if so I need him to let me in on what the problem is

12:57.720 --> 13:01.360
because we are in an airplane this dog's having a chill time and he's got his

13:01.360 --> 13:06.240
favorite tunes plan and it's nice and cool in here but he's being extremely

13:06.240 --> 13:10.680
loud art now are we 25,000 feet up in the air and is that uncomfortable for a

13:10.680 --> 13:14.400
dog yeah one of the things one of the things that'll get your your pet kicked

13:14.400 --> 13:20.040
off the plane is relieving themselves in the gate area or cabin if my dog

13:20.040 --> 13:25.200
relieves themselves in the cabin obviously that's clear I actually that's

13:25.200 --> 13:28.560
absolutely a hundred percent I'm with you I agree I would love to have this

13:28.560 --> 13:31.500
dog off the plane too because it's obviously not working out what is your

13:31.500 --> 13:37.920
plan right your ex Phil that's a threat hey yeah we're we're in the middle of

13:37.920 --> 13:42.520
the ocean you gotta pop that door open even if you're that serious about it

13:42.520 --> 13:46.280
that's putting others in danger I'm gonna steal you directly in the eye but

13:46.280 --> 13:54.600
while Rex pisses in coach there they no longer allow as of January 11th 2021

13:54.600 --> 14:00.440
they no longer allow what are listed here as non-dog service animals I love I

14:00.440 --> 14:05.280
think all animals love to think of themselves as non dogs yeah so here's

14:05.280 --> 14:10.480
what they don't permit small mammals or pocket pets like hedgehogs or sugar

14:10.480 --> 14:16.600
okay that's not a problem this is a huge mammal so we're fine so far no

14:16.600 --> 14:20.240
insects or spiders and to be fair I believe I will be the judge of that

14:20.240 --> 14:26.120
because you will never know yeah there's no rodents mice rats the

14:26.120 --> 14:31.960
hamsters they list they list out rodents mice rats hamsters gerbils guinea pigs I

14:31.960 --> 14:36.440
feel like if I'm planning to bring an animal like that on the plane I should

14:36.440 --> 14:39.440
at least know if it's a rodent or not right you don't have to specify you

14:39.440 --> 14:45.360
don't mention chinchillas interesting now they do have they list here

14:45.360 --> 14:51.320
amphibians uh-huh birds obviously they just get competitive right that with the

14:51.320 --> 14:57.560
plane animals improperly cleaned or with a foul odor that's fine this this again

14:57.560 --> 15:01.560
this ponies a gentleman it's gonna smell fucking so far we're in the clear yeah

15:01.560 --> 15:10.200
this is good so far last one animals with tusks horns or hooves oh gee goats

15:10.200 --> 15:15.600
and pigs but does not specifically list horses but they do have hook okay okay

15:15.600 --> 15:21.840
I'm just saying some large sneakers yeah never know well but they x-rays so the

15:21.840 --> 15:28.400
hooves can the hooves come off for like a minute do they regrow like Tony do

15:28.400 --> 15:31.360
they come back and I'm sure this is a horrible thing to say I'm sure it hurts

15:31.360 --> 15:35.400
and there's probably some monstrous sort of practice that is being done to

15:35.400 --> 15:39.680
horses that is not funny in the least but this isn't fine this is serious

15:39.680 --> 15:43.840
we're trying to solve a really serious issue or else this horse is gonna get

15:43.840 --> 15:49.840
left behind the horse hang their hooves out the windows and they're not on the

15:49.840 --> 15:55.760
plane that's good that's good you could also just bring them to the to the gate

15:55.760 --> 16:03.920
and just be like look at it look at his big wet eyes that animals got hooves ah

16:03.920 --> 16:08.680
fuck you're right he does oh well we can still get on right we're still cool

16:08.680 --> 16:12.760
right we're still okay right I can tell you're a pretty cool person who

16:12.760 --> 16:17.400
probably likes a hundred dollars am I right can you imagine get to the gate

16:17.400 --> 16:23.040
with your your hoof list sneaker wearing horse that has been through hell and you

16:23.040 --> 16:29.600
are walking up the tarmac and then the horse lets out a dookie and you're like

16:29.600 --> 16:37.480
we were so close mr. Chamberlain fuck I I just want to say for the record I

16:37.480 --> 16:42.120
think that lost would have been 25% better if there had been a horse

16:42.120 --> 16:46.920
survivor on the island that had been on the plane the horse lands and then they

16:46.920 --> 16:50.720
just treated it like another it was like there's yeah there's Jack yeah hey

16:50.720 --> 16:54.280
there's Sawyer there's more Chamberlain there's her and every time they make

16:54.280 --> 16:59.240
horse we gotta get off this island I would love that man I'd be so into that

16:59.240 --> 17:03.640
yeah it's making me happy thinking about it one of the things they do list I

17:03.640 --> 17:08.040
want to move from the FAQ page and this doesn't help us necessarily but I did

17:08.040 --> 17:11.640
want to mention it they're one of the FAQs is what if I have a service or

17:11.640 --> 17:15.960
support animal in training oh and they say that a service animal in training

17:15.960 --> 17:18.960
does not meet qualifications for a trained animal but I do love the idea of

17:18.960 --> 17:22.880
pull it up to the gate be like listen I'm gonna warn you right up front this

17:22.880 --> 17:29.280
guy's a fucking loose cannon yeah he will serve he services me for sure but

17:29.280 --> 17:32.920
sometimes he goes too far I've asked for his badge and gun repeatedly but he

17:32.920 --> 17:36.880
won't step down I actually have to support animals one of them very by the

17:36.880 --> 17:42.440
book yeah he's six months for retirement he's training this new rookie but that

17:42.440 --> 17:45.640
rookie cannot be controlled and they butt heads but you know what they get

17:45.640 --> 17:48.640
the job done and you're gonna be glad they're on this plane you're gonna be

17:48.640 --> 17:53.920
glad they're on this plane yeah you may need some real service done but not maybe

17:53.920 --> 17:59.080
off-book service right service they don't teach it service talk yeah cool

17:59.080 --> 18:02.400
recently my girlfriend and I moved into a new house where the landlord

18:02.400 --> 18:06.320
conveniently already provides the internet we're both biologists in our

18:06.320 --> 18:10.960
late 20s and today discovered that safe search is on through some entirely

18:10.960 --> 18:16.200
innocent and work-related web searches how do we ask our landlord to remove

18:16.200 --> 18:20.400
safe search without him immediately jumping to the conclusion that we want

18:20.400 --> 18:24.840
to desecrate his house with filthy unspeakable pornography that's from not

18:24.840 --> 18:31.280
so lewd lodgers in Leeds UK well my theory my supposition would be that if

18:31.280 --> 18:35.720
you have some sort of safe search software enabled some sort of sort of

18:35.720 --> 18:39.400
net nanny mm-hmm that there's some sort of whitelisting that you could do right

18:39.400 --> 18:44.160
which makes me know I feel like all you have to do is go to your landlord and

18:44.160 --> 18:52.240
tell him exactly the nasty URLs that you are going to be exploring yeah this is

18:52.240 --> 18:59.760
tough why because yeah I understand that it's probably 99.9 percent of the time

18:59.760 --> 19:04.920
not from unspeakable things yeah but what about that point one percent you

19:04.920 --> 19:08.760
don't want to go to him about K thanks for letting us look at like I don't know

19:08.760 --> 19:13.000
bird genitals or whatever because we're biologists but also but we actually I

19:13.000 --> 19:18.440
gotta tell you mark we accidentally did look at a dick today and we need you to

19:18.440 --> 19:22.920
tighten up the algorithms mark this is a cool this is a Christian household

19:22.920 --> 19:27.360
that's his deal his deal is he'll turn off safe search but if you it's a

19:27.360 --> 19:32.200
otter system yeah you see anything that you're not supposed to you have to let

19:32.200 --> 19:36.640
me know and I'll explain it to you yeah I'll make what you saw make sense I

19:36.640 --> 19:42.520
promise I won't leave you alone in this hey mark I saw some and they look like

19:42.520 --> 19:47.280
adults doing some stuff to each other like okay sit down I've walked so many

19:47.280 --> 19:51.880
tenants through this okay it was the mommy daddy hug do you know what I'm

19:51.880 --> 19:58.840
talking about you know mark also our disposals broken the disposals broken

19:58.840 --> 20:02.520
and I can't get my sights to load where they do the special mommy daddy hug can

20:02.520 --> 20:08.360
you come tweak both why are they dancing so hard mark they seem so angry at each

20:08.360 --> 20:15.080
other there's no music if you're like there we're fairly positive that your

20:15.080 --> 20:18.800
landlord is able to see your entire internet history right if this is the

20:18.800 --> 20:24.920
setup like 100% right yeah yeah I guess it's literally like this sounds like

20:24.920 --> 20:33.160
you're connected straight to his gmail account yeah you have to go borrow his

20:33.160 --> 20:38.080
his his lappy his laptop the computer is in the dining room that you all share

20:38.080 --> 20:42.040
and your landlord is also your dad yeah you just admit it your dad for

20:42.040 --> 20:46.760
complimentary internet access you just have to come to my place and ask to use

20:46.760 --> 20:51.200
my book yeah I'll crack it open for you my web book and it's just a sticker on

20:51.200 --> 20:56.440
it it just says the internet on it wouldn't the dad lord lets us use the

20:56.440 --> 21:02.880
internet sometimes we see some sites I think you should have a conversation

21:02.880 --> 21:07.480
with work about whether he keeps the net nanny on on his computer yes if he's

21:07.480 --> 21:13.840
doing that fair you know fair play fair play I was not he needs to let you get

21:13.840 --> 21:17.920
all the nasty corners you need ask him if you can pay extra for the dirty

21:17.920 --> 21:21.800
sites in your in your rental agreement well it will increase just like how you

21:21.800 --> 21:25.560
have a pet addendum this is just like yeah you can look at whatever you want

21:25.560 --> 21:30.960
for an extra $50 a month let me choose three dirty sites on your premium

21:30.960 --> 21:39.320
package that sucks and it should I don't think it's legal I think you should be

21:39.320 --> 21:43.160
able to do something about I don't know who you complain to the better biz the

21:43.160 --> 21:48.320
Better Business Bureau somebody somebody I don't know if they do that in the UK

21:48.320 --> 21:53.480
but this there's got to be there has to be an answer to this that we don't know

21:53.480 --> 21:56.680
because it's such a preposterous situation it shouldn't be happening do

21:56.680 --> 22:01.000
you have a 14 year old nephew who you could ask for like the creative

22:01.000 --> 22:06.440
spellings of words that he uses oh yeah to like search yeah probably hook you up

22:06.440 --> 22:10.520
he's probably got some weird ones he's like have you tried typing in Stiffy

22:10.520 --> 22:19.680
Stiffy sometimes gets through and surprisingly teats works quite often if

22:19.680 --> 22:26.880
you tape in teats but not cow sometimes you can get through teats minus cow

22:26.880 --> 22:52.360

fucking talk about Zach's pieces over here like we taught our employees how to

27:36.200 --> 27:44.920
build improvised explosive devices right and here's our last update from burger

27:44.920 --> 27:50.440
phi a chain I'm not familiar then then I and every time you do this Justin where

27:50.440 --> 27:53.800
you bring one that nobody's heard of before it's usually the rowdiest

27:53.800 --> 27:59.120
imaginable thing it's really rowdy after having nationwide success with the spicy

27:59.120 --> 28:02.920
fried chicken sandwich burger fight international is launching a new type of

28:02.920 --> 28:12.680
sandwich war what and this one has to do with burgers you can't well imagine if

28:12.680 --> 28:16.480
in the middle of World War two someone's like we're starting World War three like

28:16.480 --> 28:24.240
now you let's finish this one first shit yeah burger fires like December 7th is a

28:24.240 --> 28:29.920
day that will live in infamy and it is about burgers so this one's about

28:29.920 --> 28:35.120
burgers yeah is the burger fine menu is array of chef inspired selections and

28:35.120 --> 28:39.960
high-quality Wagyu beef it was only name it was only natural for the premium fast

28:39.960 --> 28:43.880
casual concept to take it to the next level with a one-of-a-kind spicy burger

28:43.880 --> 28:48.960
sensation whoa the swag burger features double Wagyu and a brisket burger a

28:48.960 --> 28:53.640
brisket blend burger charred jalapenos candy ghost pepper bacon to pack the

28:53.640 --> 28:58.800
heat sweet tomato relish to add a bit of sweet habanero pepper jack cheese and

28:58.800 --> 29:03.120
hot steak sauce so it's so I feel like we're in a lot of ingredient territory

29:03.120 --> 29:08.960
already right it seems like there may be shooting the cannon into burger fights

29:08.960 --> 29:12.960
credit it doesn't go out of sins there is a couple restaurants out there who

29:12.960 --> 29:16.840
are so focused on the chicken war that they're not watching their home fronts

29:16.840 --> 29:20.360
you know I mean here comes burger fire like sneaking in the back fuck you all

29:20.360 --> 29:24.920
up y'all so busy worried about chicken we're here with that beef game for the

29:24.920 --> 29:29.400
new product burger fi initiated a consumer research study focused on the

29:29.400 --> 29:34.080
initial reaction to the product use utilizing its savory description to test

29:34.080 --> 29:39.160
the appeal cool do you understand what I just said we asked people people what's

29:39.160 --> 29:45.680
on the sandwich exactly we described this sandwich would y'all like that

29:45.680 --> 29:49.440
would that good what if we added one more thing to it it says here in the

29:49.440 --> 29:59.080
press release do you like it this burger is hot as fuck and I'll melt a hole

29:59.080 --> 30:03.520
through the back of your skull do you want it yeah they conducted a concept

30:03.520 --> 30:11.440
test on the flavor build product name and price if they're like okay what if

30:11.440 --> 30:15.480
we called it Dave super smash burger that's pretty good what if instead of

30:15.480 --> 30:19.360
four pieces of bacon you had three I don't know that seems less good okay no

30:19.360 --> 30:22.600
did thank you does okay but Justin that does kind of makes sense as to why it's

30:22.600 --> 30:28.600
called the swag burger why it's called the swag burger oh yeah I'm not there

30:28.600 --> 30:33.480
yet over 2,500 participants were part of the study with approximately 500 people

30:33.480 --> 30:38.320
per concept tested so what they said is they came up with five different rad

30:38.320 --> 30:43.440
burgers the research proved invaluable in determining the selection of Wagyu

30:43.440 --> 30:49.360
beef versus Angus beef in the burger wow that's a long way of saying that

30:49.360 --> 30:53.240
let's check in with Paul Griffin burger fries chief culinary officer the CCO

30:53.240 --> 30:58.440
burger fries foundation is burgers and because the spicy chicken wars have

30:58.440 --> 31:03.360
been part of the cultural conversation over the past few years they're safe I

31:03.360 --> 31:07.040
think it's cuz that's the only one they have something more they've picked a

31:07.040 --> 31:10.840
little notch of the war that they could carve out for themselves right well it's

31:10.840 --> 31:14.760
a war on many fronts you have the ground war you have the at sea you have the

31:14.760 --> 31:19.960
sky ground before I see the grilling war yeah the chicken wars have been part of

31:19.960 --> 31:24.080
the cultural conversation over the past few years is that really I mean I know

31:24.080 --> 31:27.320
you guys talk about it a lot but I haven't heard a single human being alive

31:27.320 --> 31:31.760
references we've been talking about it a lot Justin well in our little corner of

31:31.760 --> 31:35.000
culture which is obviously a biased sample yeah one where you talk about

31:35.000 --> 31:40.320
fast food all the time the proc it's this whole thing started as a way to

31:40.320 --> 31:45.040
find a new chick-fil-a that everyone can eat without feeling like dog shit about

31:45.040 --> 31:49.320
it and it started out as emotionally started out as something fun and it

31:49.320 --> 31:53.040
started as something virtuous and everybody was just like all hands on

31:53.040 --> 31:56.120
deck but then it turned into well I think Popeye's is the best replacement

31:56.120 --> 31:59.400
well I think Zaxby's is the best replacement and then Popeye's and

31:59.400 --> 32:06.060
Zaxby's was like it's a war baby and it's not we're having fun while thwarting

32:06.060 --> 32:10.200
fucking chick-fil-a but can we remember what it's all about and now other people

32:10.200 --> 32:17.400
are talking about like no it's burgers war now it's gonna be car war I will say

32:17.400 --> 32:20.640
Griffin that there's still some virtue to it I see a lot of young folks out

32:20.640 --> 32:25.000
there they're you know they're recycling their scrap metal they're turning in

32:25.000 --> 32:29.440
their nylons to support the troops out there sure everybody's a part of this

32:29.440 --> 32:35.680
effort Griffin I won't sit here and let you besmirch the honor yeah of our

32:35.680 --> 32:39.640
troops you know what I mean and Griffin I think maybe if you had a little bit

32:39.640 --> 32:45.040
more patriotism thank you um it cared a little bit more about the chicken wars

32:45.040 --> 32:49.200
just let me wrap this up please Paul Griffin is not done Paul Griffin could

32:49.200 --> 32:52.920
have stopped there but instead Paul Griffin continued once we had the idea

32:52.920 --> 32:58.360
of the spicy burger it was fun to start playing with ingredients and texture it

32:58.360 --> 33:03.280
was the best day of my life it was so fun this has been actually super fun the

33:03.280 --> 33:07.560
candy ghost pepper bacon is perfect for those guests are more adventurous and

33:07.560 --> 33:13.560
that makes with the boldness of Wagyu and the creamy and this and the kick of

33:13.560 --> 33:19.280
habanero pepper jack cheese it really rounds out the burger to make it one of

33:19.280 --> 33:25.080
the most flavorful menu items at burger fight and you could tell the person like

33:25.080 --> 33:30.120
dictating this it was just like still nodding and maybe Paul was like um I say

33:30.120 --> 33:34.040
something else or are we okay that seems like enough that's good yeah I should

33:34.040 --> 33:37.680
stop there taking this while sitting on the toilet they had been sitting on for

33:37.680 --> 33:43.640
the last hour and a half trying to pass one of these through their system but

33:43.640 --> 33:50.160

door behind him hey it's me it's me the owner of burger fire Justin McElroy I

34:16.760 --> 34:20.640

34:24.600 --> 34:29.240
redefining the way world eats burgers okay oh boy

34:29.240 --> 34:35.520

34:40.640 --> 34:46.400
experience okay damn I could go for a burger no yeah I get I mean that's the

34:46.400 --> 34:53.080
one that's the terrible part about this segment is I always end up extremely

34:53.080 --> 34:57.440
yeah do you know what this is gonna be the worst outcome for burger fi is that

34:57.440 --> 35:03.640
no one will rise to their challenge no one will even acknowledge that they have

35:03.640 --> 35:08.440
attempted to start a burger war and if and life's just gonna go on without

35:08.440 --> 35:12.960
burger fi sort of being a part of it and that's him that's gonna be embarrassing

35:12.960 --> 35:15.920

in October 2020 okay are you kidding me can you think of a more challenging time

35:30.400 --> 35:35.360
to step into these waters Julio doesn't give a shit anyway that's

35:35.360 --> 35:39.800
that's a update please let me know if you tried different chicken sandwiches

35:39.800 --> 35:45.960

about it or you could to him at me if you want I just always like to try to

35:49.480 --> 35:52.760

35:52.760 --> 35:57.160

36:14.240 --> 36:18.320

36:18.320 --> 36:22.640
kids are growing up now Joe there I did give you that big medal

Joe look at it you remember so we're gonna take a quick break and right now

36:27.600 --> 36:31.880
and then we'll come back with more great content until then let's kick it over to

36:31.880 --> 36:34.520
the money zone

36:46.600 --> 36:51.360
stamps are great you can put them on mail to make the mail go places and you

36:51.360 --> 36:55.760
can collect them and create decks of stamps that you battle against other

36:55.760 --> 37:01.520
folks for their stance that lasts forever sure yeah there's stamps that

37:01.520 --> 37:07.120
lasts forever and then there's hollow hollow foil ones yeah and they're chase

37:07.120 --> 37:11.360
there's chase stamps and those can be fun but going you know it's not fun it's

37:11.360 --> 37:14.600
just going to the post office when you're not feeling like it well stance

37:14.600 --> 37:19.200
calm is gonna keep you from having to make such a dreary afternoon of it

37:19.200 --> 37:23.640
because they let you print off postage right there it's your freaking computer

37:23.640 --> 37:26.760
you can send letters or packages and you can pay a lot less with discounted rates

37:26.760 --> 37:35.800
from USPS UPS and more so it cuts out a lot of the BS yeah I think and yeah

37:35.800 --> 37:41.160
whoever do a stamps calm and so good that they'll put us on stamps oh man

37:41.160 --> 37:46.560
though we could probably get them to put us on stamps calm like a picture of us

37:46.560 --> 37:49.800
like having a great time battling our stamps against each other but I don't

37:49.800 --> 37:53.240
know if they would actually put us on the postage itself I want to be on the

37:53.240 --> 37:57.120
postage I want to do that that feels like a cool thing that not everybody

37:57.120 --> 38:02.440
gets to do right well gotta be president or go to space and make a big space

38:02.440 --> 38:06.000
so much work though can I just do a really good ad read in the middle of my

38:06.000 --> 38:10.800
podcast you gotta invent some medicine go to space and make a space discovery

38:10.800 --> 38:18.120
or be the president trap they got discounts up to 40% off post office

we're the majority a here's a here's another question from our dear listeners

43:33.680 --> 43:38.400
I'm a college student and decided to spontaneously bleach my hair at home

43:38.400 --> 43:44.440
it's kind of a disaster flash forwards now I want to get it cut but I'm

43:44.440 --> 43:49.260
absolutely terrified the hairdresser will somehow find a way to yell at me

43:49.260 --> 43:54.200
for bleaching my hair at home what should I do if I get bombarded with guilt from

43:54.200 --> 44:02.160
a professional that's from son of a bleach in Ohio there is no one in the

44:02.160 --> 44:05.000
contiguous United States of America that would know how to answer this question

44:05.000 --> 44:12.760
I'm going through my US contacts I'm fucking coming up empty oh you know who

44:12.760 --> 44:17.560
can help yeah we could reach across the pond and then down through the bigger

44:17.560 --> 44:25.560
pond across the pond a sort of diagonal vertex across many pond let's just call

44:25.560 --> 44:29.480
call Australia I think it's like I know it's like Friday there what do you

44:29.480 --> 44:33.600
yeah it's Friday so sure I didn't have the answer Montaigne we'll just call

44:33.600 --> 44:39.320
Montaigne who created who created the my brother my brother me theme song yeah

44:39.320 --> 44:43.160
right there you heard earlier so let's just call hold on don't forget to dial

44:43.160 --> 44:45.800
the extra numbers oh thanks now you're saying you great

44:45.800 --> 45:08.680
extra number thing I didn't bring bring hey hello it's Montaigne hi Montaigne

45:08.680 --> 45:13.320
I'm Justin McElroy you probably saw that on the caller ID though I'm actually

45:13.320 --> 45:19.880
you know so I don't have it saved but I'll wait yeah no I'll do it give me a

45:19.880 --> 45:26.740
sec all of our guests do this I did it really very very uncomfortable for me

45:26.740 --> 45:35.840
and Travis if he asked you about LinkedIn just hang up thank you so much for for

45:35.840 --> 45:41.800
answering this I think unsolvable paradox for us and also for writing one

45:41.800 --> 45:54.120
one real slap in tune slap a rip the first thing is now that I'm 40 there's

45:54.120 --> 45:59.680
literally no good way for me to refer to a piece of music I mean like there's

45:59.680 --> 46:09.040
not there's nothing that is it woefully sort of antiquated or like sweaty beyond

46:09.040 --> 46:13.040
all recognition yeah that's why I just lean into it at this point and I just

46:13.040 --> 46:16.840
say like this is a swinging to but I have to hear you say I have to hear you

46:16.840 --> 46:24.960
say that cost the real human cost Montaigne you have hair I actually I have

46:24.960 --> 46:34.240
I've pretty little hair at the moment I have a buzz cut and it's yeah sorry but

46:34.240 --> 46:37.080
you've met you've met you've messed around with your hair probably at

46:37.080 --> 46:44.200
different times you know others with hair how do you deal with okay you're in a

46:44.200 --> 46:48.580
professional setting I know I just want to say I know that the concedes that we

46:48.580 --> 46:52.400
need in Montaigne's Hell on this I also have dyed hair I'm just gonna say no

46:52.400 --> 46:57.640
it's not the same Montaigne you're a professional setting with people how do

46:57.640 --> 47:02.920
you how do you deal okay I'll give you I'll re I'll refigure it for like your

47:02.920 --> 47:10.120
experience when you're talking to a nobody like ourselves about music and

47:10.120 --> 47:14.200
you know so much about music yeah where where are you at with that are you in

47:14.200 --> 47:18.080
like a judgmental place usually are you in a place where you're like wanting to

47:18.080 --> 47:24.160
help where are you at definitely not um definitely not judgmental that I yeah

47:24.160 --> 47:29.880
yeah music is for everyone you know no matter how much knowledge or wisdom is

47:29.880 --> 47:35.360
involved it is you know to be shared and loved in whatever way that each

47:35.360 --> 47:42.440
individual person wants it to be shared and loved and I think like you guys good

47:42.440 --> 47:47.240
with that love music I think so definitely no judgment there very nice

47:47.240 --> 47:51.720
I think that's very pleasant if you go to a hairdresser with a bad home bleached

47:51.720 --> 47:56.800
on they're not going to be angry at you they're going to judge you and feel bad

47:56.800 --> 48:01.560
for you it's going to be you're gonna hear a lot of oh yeah to carry the

48:01.560 --> 48:05.920
analogy when I'm sure when Montaigne heard my Rugrats theme song for the

48:05.920 --> 48:11.840
show Montaigne what didn't send me an email like you suck shit yeah don't do

48:11.840 --> 48:18.000
music I genuinely loved I genuinely loved the Rugrats cover quite frankly I

48:18.000 --> 48:24.720
thought it was so nice if you loved it so much Montaigne we're gonna need that

48:24.720 --> 48:32.120
huge novelty check back that we left on your on your back for now just forward

48:32.120 --> 48:40.880
that to class what's your approach to hair do you just feel like you were

48:40.880 --> 48:44.240
talking about you keep it very short right now is that just like the look you

48:44.240 --> 48:47.240
like do you experiment a lot do you just say like hey whatever just sort of

48:47.240 --> 48:50.320
entertains you right now that's what I'm going with I've had the same haircut

48:50.320 --> 48:57.080
since I was six my approach is fairly impulsive I'd say for the Eurovision

48:57.080 --> 49:02.840
stuff in particular I had a very particular aesthetic that I wanted which

49:02.840 --> 49:10.560
was have really short buzz cut hair that is like ultra colorful so my hair for

49:10.560 --> 49:15.440
Eurovision will be quite rainbow and buzz cut it but like a year ago my hair

49:15.440 --> 49:20.200
was just like natural color like short but not buzz cut and then the year

49:20.200 --> 49:24.120
before that was blue it was quite long and the year before that was pink so

49:24.120 --> 49:29.040
just like whatever I feel like really must be nice keeping keeping everybody's

49:29.040 --> 49:33.280
heads on swivel exactly I made the mistake of having my purple hair become

49:33.280 --> 49:37.480
part of our merchandise and now Justin and Griffin won't let me change it you

49:37.480 --> 49:41.240
know you mentioned Eurovision I that's such a coincidence because your your

49:41.240 --> 49:48.920
Eurovision track see even track like track my mouth it turns to actual my

49:48.920 --> 49:55.360
lips Technicolor is the name of the song the video came out today as we're

49:55.360 --> 50:00.520
recording this I gotta go almost go as you're listening to it it's called

50:00.520 --> 50:04.560
Technicolor you can find it on YouTube I think it's streaming on Spotify

50:04.560 --> 50:10.280
Eurovision that's massive congratulations thank you it is big in a

50:10.280 --> 50:17.080
way that I find rather intimidating really yeah oh my god I'm like no not

50:17.080 --> 50:24.000
really big I know it's big you seem so cool and confident I think I mostly am I

50:24.000 --> 50:29.800
think every like other week my anxiety will start to like build up there a

50:29.800 --> 50:34.560
little bit just because like there's a lot I think the issue is that there's

50:34.560 --> 50:39.720
this enormous compression of like time and the number of things that we can get

50:39.720 --> 50:42.600
done in a certain number of time and you want to do things well and when you don't

50:42.600 --> 50:47.040
have time it's hard to do that in a way that is like foolproof so that's been

50:47.040 --> 50:55.640
a bit of a stress oh yeah thanks for wasting time on our song this to God

50:55.640 --> 50:58.680
literally a dream come true we're gonna talk about that and just one second I

50:58.680 --> 51:02.280
want to talk about Technicolor for one more second cuz it is so fucking good

51:02.280 --> 51:05.840
and if you go listen to it you're gonna listen to it on repeat everybody on our

51:05.840 --> 51:10.960
staff has been listening to it literally constantly sharing the be around we are

51:10.960 --> 51:16.600
in love with it I I want to ask you I was watching the the performance video

51:16.600 --> 51:22.360
today that did you wish at any point while you have been recording in this

51:22.360 --> 51:27.840
and do you ever wish you put fewer notes in it because maybe you guys sing a lot

51:27.840 --> 51:32.760
of notes in front of like but a bajillion people on a massive stage

51:32.760 --> 51:36.880
you're like god I put a lot of notes in this mother fucking five notes not five

51:36.880 --> 51:42.040
but certainly not this many it's a lot honestly there is very little time to

51:42.040 --> 51:44.800
breathe in the song which is quite difficult because we have organized

51:44.800 --> 51:49.680
this choreography for it as well I think like all of it is manageable if I

51:49.680 --> 51:59.160
stand still but I've I've opted I've opted not to which country are you most

51:59.160 --> 52:05.160
gunning for yeah yeah I don't know if you guys paid any attention to Eurovision

52:05.160 --> 52:12.960
last year but Iceland put forward the most ripping guys like absolutely

52:12.960 --> 52:15.660
fantastic god it makes you mad how good it is

52:15.660 --> 52:19.920
Jimmy comes up listen this fucking song it's amazing and the video and the

52:19.920 --> 52:24.840
conceit like it's about his unborn or like too little to have any

52:24.840 --> 52:30.680
consciousness kid who's wondering about the thoughts of and it's just like so

52:30.680 --> 52:35.040
sweet and the video is so funny it's just he's amazing I'm actually a huge

52:35.040 --> 52:39.240
fan of him you're gonna crush him right you guys you guys you guys heard this

52:39.240 --> 52:43.520
song right here here I want to play you five seconds of the song I'm allowed to

52:43.520 --> 52:45.920
like Eurovision I don't care and just be quiet for a

52:45.920 --> 53:14.400
second unbelievable but you're gonna beat their ass beat them all the way

53:14.400 --> 53:19.680
back to Iceland um hey let's talk about the my brother my brother me theme song

53:19.680 --> 53:31.040
which I guess is not gonna be called I titled it in the file I sent to you my

53:31.040 --> 53:36.400
life and then in brackets is better with you exclamation mark from my brother my

53:36.400 --> 53:43.320
brother and we can work on that we can Sufjan it up a bit and just be like in

53:43.320 --> 53:49.000
brackets just be like a fateful occurrence on the shores of the on the

53:49.000 --> 53:55.960
great wide Mississippi exactly yeah what what is amazing about your song is we

53:55.960 --> 54:01.920
had a very I mean it couldn't have been a more abstract brief that we slid across

54:01.920 --> 54:06.160
your proverbial desk I didn't find it abstract at all actually I thought was

54:06.160 --> 54:11.280
really clear oh well that's good to hear but you really I mean we told you sort

54:11.280 --> 54:18.200
of kind of what we were in the market for and it's like you reach into our

54:18.200 --> 54:22.760
brains and found a song that somehow fulfilled all of it without us being

54:22.760 --> 54:27.960
able to like actually articulate any of that so how'd you do that I guess is my

54:27.960 --> 54:34.400
question which is I mean I am your demo like I was already a listener of the

54:34.400 --> 54:40.960
show for like a few years and like I'm into comedy and Sam and my partner

54:40.960 --> 54:47.000
writes funny things and yeah I guess like that's already a genre and a type

54:47.000 --> 54:51.760
of music that I'm familiar with and amenable to and enjoy making a lot and

54:51.760 --> 54:56.320
also like there's a bit of a 2000s revival happening right and like let's

54:56.320 --> 55:03.280
sort of based on the brief I what I imagined was a kind of like high school

55:03.280 --> 55:09.120
coming-of-age like comedy film where it's like incredibly corny and but very

55:09.120 --> 55:16.640
like instead of being about awful boys who do terrible things in high school it

55:16.640 --> 55:20.320
was gonna be about like these two friends who like meet each other and

55:20.320 --> 55:28.200
they just generally oh hello my cat captain poodles has just walked in yeah

55:28.200 --> 55:31.360
it was just gonna be about like two wholesome friends who like meet each

55:31.360 --> 55:35.200
other enjoy each other's company and then realize like oh this is really

55:35.200 --> 55:39.280
great and my life is is nice and I thought that was that fit the vibe of

55:39.280 --> 55:43.120
the show yeah it's great who's the friend who's the friends and I get like

55:43.120 --> 55:48.760
if we're gonna miss to miss if you want sir I can make no no no because I want

55:48.760 --> 55:52.560
this to be like the who's the me and my brother my brother and me I we need more

55:52.560 --> 55:58.240
we need more mystique around our show at this point we've given so much away it

55:58.240 --> 56:02.760
makes me you know the fact the first time I thought about it listen to the

56:02.760 --> 56:09.200
song and this is so I don't know this is perhaps overly modeling but um it it

56:09.200 --> 56:14.400
really exemplifies the way that not how I think about my brother is really at

56:14.400 --> 56:20.000
all but okay that's kind of a zero sum but how I think about our our listeners

56:20.000 --> 56:24.480
like the people who listen to the show like it really captures my the

56:24.480 --> 56:29.240
exuberance I have for like making stuff for them and because of the pandemic

56:29.240 --> 56:34.640
like the extent to which I have missed seeing people like seeing people that

56:34.640 --> 56:38.320
like listen to our stuff and meeting our listeners who are kind of like an

56:38.320 --> 56:43.640
extended family for us like it really captured that that sense I have like not

56:43.640 --> 56:47.840
kind of a little bit of the the bittersweet part of like missing seeing

56:47.840 --> 56:50.880
them and missing seeing them in person and doing shows for them but also like

56:50.880 --> 56:56.360
how how much they have improved our life just by listening to our stuff it really

56:56.360 --> 57:00.720
captures that energy I didn't get that at all cool that's all right that's

57:00.720 --> 57:04.960
music for you huh it just made it made me miss going to the movies you know what

57:04.960 --> 57:10.320
I mean like why'd you have to cut out my rap verse yeah let's talk about the

57:10.320 --> 57:13.480
third and fourth and fifth verses that we wrote for the song that you did not

57:13.480 --> 57:16.440
include you know what Griffin we'll include it now Griffin if you just want

57:16.440 --> 57:20.760
to do it yeah well the problem is in the note that I got back from Montana and I

57:20.760 --> 57:24.200
thought it was fair and I didn't have an answer to it she said this is mostly

57:24.200 --> 57:30.600
numbers right I said that's I guess you have a good point there I hadn't thought

57:30.600 --> 57:34.640
about it is that this this verse is most it's more numbers than words and it is

57:34.640 --> 57:41.320
basically math equation and you did and you said that doesn't match the vibe and

57:41.320 --> 57:49.480
I took that I took that very personally yeah I'm sorry but sometimes the truth

57:49.480 --> 57:55.000
hurts and you're just gonna live with it and and and grow strong and move on you

57:55.000 --> 58:01.320
know do you think it's weird Martin that your song technicolor includes the line

58:01.320 --> 58:09.160
yeah I promise you yes all you nasty dudes and that's not in our song it

58:09.160 --> 58:18.240
seems impossible that you wrote that lyric but it's not part of our again it

58:18.240 --> 58:22.420
didn't feel like it fit the vibe of the song but again if we do a remix and I'm

58:22.420 --> 58:29.720
happy to splice the two and make a technicolor move in BAM themed mashup I

58:29.720 --> 58:34.360
want to do a remix of the song that's just this song exactly as it is but it

58:34.360 --> 58:40.440
includes clips from the show interspersed like they do I'm like Batman Michael

58:40.440 --> 58:46.640
Keaton come in like of good good work last time you all watch the kids from a

58:46.640 --> 58:51.120
rose music video because it's just shots from the movie interspersed with seal

58:51.120 --> 58:55.460
like standing next to like a floodlight and it's all lit the same as the movie

58:55.460 --> 59:01.240
clip yeah like so it's like seal is on it I'm on an adjacent rooftop I'm

59:01.240 --> 59:08.200
watching Batman and Nicole Kidman Montaigne what's next for you obviously

59:08.200 --> 59:12.880
very focused on Eurovision that's gonna be this spring and then what's what's

59:12.880 --> 59:19.400
what's after that um maybe album three I guess last year I made a lot of music

59:19.400 --> 59:24.880
with the same guy who did the theme song and who did the Eurovision song and I

59:24.880 --> 59:28.760
think it's probably it's probably adding up to a third album which I'm excited

59:28.760 --> 59:35.080
about who is that who is that that did his name's Dave Hammer Dave Hammer yeah

59:35.080 --> 59:43.120
he's a key guy his name is Dave Hammer and you waited now to mention it he his

59:43.120 --> 59:49.560
name is Dave Hammer well his real name is David Haddad but his his like former

59:49.560 --> 59:55.080
official sort of name is Dave Hammer both great names his real name is dr.

59:55.080 --> 01:00:04.960
smashing style but yeah so just like a lot of hammer based music production in

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:10.440
the studio that's not true no he's a really awesome lovely person who

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:16.080
listens to all my crazy ideas and yeah just so easy to work with and we've made

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:20.800
really really cool stuff like over the last year which I'm really excited about

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:26.280
and hopefully can do more of this coming well I we're so thrilled to have you as

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:32.040
part of our sort of extended extended extended family and I stuttered that I

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:35.240
didn't mean to say extended seven times because it really it really imbued it

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:45.920
with a distance and arms reach that I do live very far away but oh my god Montaigne

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:50.680
when we do get down there to or over there it's kind of down it's basically

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:55.040
down it's a perspective in it but when we get down there we'll do a shot you

01:00:55.040 --> 01:01:00.240
will do a show together it's gonna be great I just gonna say really quickly as

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:04.760
well I recently did an interview from like the Mardi Gras event with Courtney

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:09.640
Act who's this amazing drag queen and was done on top of the Harbour Bridge

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:14.520
and what was so funny to me it was like entering the facility where they like

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.480
hosts the Harbour Bridge climbs and stuff like that they have all these

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:21.240
pictures of like all these celebrities who've done the bridge climb and I

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:25.880
forgot like how much of a staple of like tourism and like celebrities visiting

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:29.960
Australia that was like doing the bridge climb because like everyone like the

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:34.960
village people had a photo there and like Danny Radcliffe when he was 11 and

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:38.000
like all these people it was very funny anyway you guys go to the bridge climb

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.360
and I climb a bridge sure yeah absolutely okay we got a bridge here

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:48.520
that Montaigne all right over we've all got breaks over the New River to West

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:54.800
Virginia it's over the New River Gorge which is a just a massive thing very

01:01:54.800 --> 01:02:00.800
deep hole like really gorgeous it's a deep hole and it's weird the weirdest

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:06.360
thing about it is there's this thing called bridge day where for one not real

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:14.400
for one day it's legal to jump off the bridge like yeah but very localized to

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:18.480
be clear jump off the bridge like with a parachute yeah with the parachute or

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:23.400
base jump or whatever your flavor is but there's this I don't know how I just

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:27.240
wish I had been there when it started so he's like okay everybody I've

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:33.640
adopted to make a sheriff everyone can jump off the bridge today asking that's

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:37.920
really funny that's great thank you so much for for being with us and thanks

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:42.840
for the help and thanks for writing our song where can people find more Montaigne

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:48.120
oh man so many places there's obviously like you said like my music streams on

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:51.320
Spotify but it also you know Apple music and you should build all that stuff I

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:55.720
also twitch stream and I like make music live on my twitch often I haven't

01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:59.280
streamed for a while because I've been so tanked with like Eurovision stuff but

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:03.920
me my partner also sometimes just play games and I also have a discord if

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:06.760
anyone wants to join the disco it's a really wholesome lovely place we've

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:10.800
mostly just sent each other pictures of like our animals gosh what else I think

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:15.360
that's kind of it and like if you live in Australia or in Sydney you'll

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.960
probably see me around on the street because I've got the brightest head

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:23.600
visible from all kinds of kilometers away nice all right thank you so much

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:31.760

Norris thank you guys for having me so much hey guys real thank you so real

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:41.760
quick before we wrap up I just shared a link and the slack I want you guys to

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:45.840
look at this tweet because just real quick I want you to think about what the

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:49.760
implications of this are I've never watched The Masked Singer before but

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:56.840
apparently it was revealed that the giant snail contained well you see in

01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:02.640
the video a celebrity and it was this really weird reveal and then the

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.320
celebrity in the giant snail when you guys see it just say it out loud hey

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:12.320
kidding me with this this is so unfair

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:16.320
spoilers for The Masked Singer but the giant snail was Kermit the Frog what

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:21.120
does that mean what does that mean hey how was anybody supposed to fucking

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:26.520
guess that how what is that wait what does that mean but Kermit the Frog who's

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:32.560
Kermit yes thank you but it wasn't Kermit it was the person it was that's not

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:37.960
