00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:47.840
Hello, and welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm

00:47.840 --> 00:51.760
your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother. I've just been handed this,

00:51.760 --> 00:54.320
Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin.

00:54.320 --> 01:06.720
He's Griffin, I'm Justin, and this is How We Do It. This is a holiday special in the sense that

01:06.720 --> 01:13.920
it is mid-December. Fair, and the holidays are here again, and we wanted to share with you some

01:13.920 --> 01:19.440
of our holiday recommendations, ways that you can make it really special, specific to different

01:19.440 --> 01:29.200
holidays. I want to talk about my favorite holiday movies, Justin.

01:29.200 --> 01:30.880
Okay, what are they, Travis?

01:30.880 --> 01:32.240
I like the one-

01:32.240 --> 01:35.280
I want to talk about my favorite Christmas cookies.

01:35.280 --> 01:39.520
This is a sub-bracket. This is a sub-bracket within the kind of a carrot.

01:39.520 --> 01:42.400
Okay, Griffin, you go, and then we'll slingshot back up.

01:42.400 --> 01:48.880
You've heard of Elf on a Shelf. Well, what about Dilf on a Shilf?

01:48.880 --> 01:50.640
How is that a cookie?

01:50.640 --> 01:53.280
Oh, no, I changed it again.

01:53.280 --> 01:53.760
Damn it.

01:54.400 --> 01:58.880
The subject. We can't get through a complete holiday thought this episode, Travis. You know the rules.

01:58.880 --> 02:02.000
I want to talk about my favorite holiday sweaters.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Okay, Travis, what's your favorite holiday sweater?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.160
I like the fuzzy ones.

02:06.800 --> 02:12.000
Okay, listener, now, if you looked at your touch-tone phone, you can press 1 if you want

02:12.000 --> 02:16.080
to hear a bit about movies, press 2 if you want to hear the sweater thing,

02:17.120 --> 02:20.960
and press 3 if you want to talk about cookies.

02:20.960 --> 02:26.160
Oh, they've chosen movies. Okay, my favorite movies is the one where the birch log is crackling,

02:27.120 --> 02:32.000
and you can see a couple of the stockings hanging, and it goes for about an hour.

02:32.880 --> 02:38.560
I love that. Chevy Chase is so funny. I like the one where it's a fireplace,

02:38.560 --> 02:48.960
but it has not been enkindled, and there's an okay dad, and he's in the fireplace trying to fix it,

02:49.840 --> 02:56.880
and it's an hour of him just sort of clanging around, and there's long stretches where you just

02:56.880 --> 03:04.640
kind of see his jeans, and it looks like he's laying perfectly still in there for 15 minutes,

03:04.640 --> 03:08.320
just because he's too ashamed to come out and get on Google, and maybe actually he

03:08.320 --> 03:14.160
likes it in there. It's quiet. In the fireplace? He likes it in the fireplace? It's quiet.

03:14.160 --> 03:18.720
He's standing up in the chimney. It's a big chimney at this point. He's up in it.

03:18.720 --> 03:25.520
I like the one where it's the people renting an Airbnb, and they light a fire in the fireplace

03:25.520 --> 03:30.240
because it's the holidays, but they don't realize that the flu was closed years and years ago,

03:30.880 --> 03:35.040
and so the house fills with smoke, and they end up having to call the fire department.

03:35.040 --> 03:39.360
The fire department comes and puts it out, and then they have to pay for smoke damages to the

03:39.360 --> 03:44.480
house. And then Kirk Cameron shows up and saves everyone with his face. Yeah, and he just keeps

03:44.480 --> 03:52.960
yelling, fireproof! Yeah, it's pretty good. I like the one where it's a family watching a video

03:53.600 --> 04:00.160
of the Christmas log, but the family looks nicer than your family. I mean, this is a hot family.

04:00.160 --> 04:02.480
Yeah, they've got it going on. Is that the one where it looks like you're looking through the

04:02.480 --> 04:09.120
window at them? Yeah, that's a good one. I like the one where it's a family, but they're not

04:09.120 --> 04:16.240
watching the fireplace. It's just lit behind them. They have turned to face you, and they stare right

04:16.240 --> 04:22.160
at you for one hour in complete silence. I like the one that's exactly like that,

04:22.160 --> 04:26.800
but they're talking to each other instead of looking at the fireplace, and I'm just screaming

04:26.800 --> 04:33.280
at the screen. Come on! Look at that beautiful fireplace, y'all. You're missing the best show

04:33.280 --> 04:38.720
on Earth. I like the one where it's kind of like that, and I'm looking into their window,

04:38.720 --> 04:45.280
watching them watch a fire and talk to each other, and then I show up in it, but it's like a slightly

04:45.280 --> 04:51.920
better looking me who looks happy and more successful than I am, and then I slowly fade

04:51.920 --> 04:59.760
away in real life. Oh, fascinating. Yeah, I like that one a lot. I like the one where a family of

04:59.760 --> 05:14.240
fires watches a box of human flesh. Just sort of jibbling and gurgling around. I like Evil Dead 2.

05:14.240 --> 05:26.480
Oh, okay. And another thing. I don't want to get off on a tangent, but I couldn't get through the

05:26.480 --> 05:34.560
series. I don't know. It wasn't the same. So this is our advice show. No, it's a holiday special.

05:36.240 --> 05:40.880
Our next episode is explicitly going to be our holiday special, so I don't know what this is.

05:40.880 --> 05:44.480
This one's special because of how non-holiday themed it's going to seem.

05:45.040 --> 05:51.760
The episode you heard last Monday was recorded that Monday. This episode is recorded the Wednesday

05:51.760 --> 05:58.720
after that. So right now, I don't think my brothers are very funny, but no, it's not you.

05:58.720 --> 06:06.240
I also don't think I'm funny. It's just like I should be doing yard work. That's what my human

06:06.240 --> 06:15.040
body right now is built for, is yard work. You know, just like a grownup sort of yard business.

06:15.040 --> 06:16.720
Yeah, we got all the wiggles out.

06:16.720 --> 06:20.320
Yeah, I can't. Travis is right. I can't be silly right now.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.520
And you all want me to be silly right now? I've got hedges to trim.

06:25.520 --> 06:27.920
Yeah, our parents took us to the kids' museum.

06:27.920 --> 06:33.520
Yeah, Justin, fucking grip it and rip it, baby. Slop that down, dude. Shit,

06:33.520 --> 06:38.320
yeah, dude. Crack one for the big boy. Fuck, yeah, dude.

06:38.320 --> 06:39.840
Yeah, let the big dog hunt.

06:39.840 --> 06:43.920
Let the big dog out, dude, and cram it, dude. Shit, yeah.

06:47.520 --> 06:50.320
Come on. Growl, big dog.

06:50.320 --> 06:53.040
Justin, if you would just open those before we started recording,

06:53.040 --> 06:55.680
this wouldn't have to be an ongoing segment.

06:55.680 --> 06:58.240
Okay, here's a real thing.

06:58.240 --> 07:02.320
I don't want to talk about it. I just fainted.

07:03.920 --> 07:04.240
Wait.

07:04.960 --> 07:06.720
I just fainted for a second.

07:08.720 --> 07:13.360
From that. While I was laughing, I fainted. What do you guys think about that?

07:13.360 --> 07:18.640
Well, we talked about this two episodes ago, and now it's come to pass.

07:18.640 --> 07:20.400
Fucking, I know, dude, goosebumps.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.880
That is my favorite episode of Goosebumps.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.760
It becomes real in real life. Goosebumps.

07:27.760 --> 07:28.960
Yeah.

07:28.960 --> 07:32.640
We did a podcast about it, and then it became real in real life Goosebumps.

07:32.640 --> 07:35.200
That's actually what RL stands for, is real life Stein.

07:36.480 --> 07:37.600
Not a lot of people know that.

07:38.160 --> 07:39.680
Juice, it's probably not great.

07:39.680 --> 07:40.240
You should-

07:40.240 --> 07:43.360
It's fine, but it's fun though. I'm having fun with my brothers,

07:43.360 --> 07:46.320
and I'm sitting in a comfortable chair. It's fine.

07:46.320 --> 07:47.840
Yeah, it's fine and fun.

07:47.840 --> 07:50.080
And listen, if this causes Justin to die,

07:50.080 --> 07:53.200
he'll die doing what he loves, thinking I'm really funny.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.400
Great jokes, yeah.

07:54.400 --> 07:57.920
Having great jokes. It wasn't even a joke. It was just you observing the fact that I

07:57.920 --> 08:01.280
cracked open a refreshing Pepsi Zero Sugar.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.560
Yeah, dog.

08:02.560 --> 08:06.720
I go to an art university, and we usually have critiques where we talk about our works at the

08:06.720 --> 08:10.880
end of the semester. One of my professors, who is really nice, usually brings in some

08:10.880 --> 08:15.920
cookies he made for the critiques. However, the cookies have a large nut in them and love them,

08:15.920 --> 08:19.040
and I do not like eating them, but I do enjoy the cookie parts.

08:19.920 --> 08:23.200
I tried to pick out the nut, but the cookies made in such a way that it basically exploded

08:23.200 --> 08:27.200
into powder in my hands if I do so. What do I do, brothers? Do I eat around the nut

08:27.200 --> 08:31.840
and throw it away when no one's looking? Do I decline the cookie even though I like eating

08:31.840 --> 08:35.760
them? I don't want to be rude and decline the cookies that he has made. That's from Cookie

08:35.760 --> 08:36.400
Conundrum.

08:37.280 --> 08:38.960
That's art, isn't it?

08:38.960 --> 08:39.460
What?

08:40.240 --> 08:42.160
This is art. This could be art.

08:42.160 --> 08:43.280
This could be an art piece.

08:43.280 --> 08:47.040
This is an art piece, and it's talking about how we all have...

08:47.040 --> 08:55.520
We all sort of put out a good energy, a positive energy, but inside, we're all a little nuts,

08:55.520 --> 08:56.480
aren't we?

08:56.480 --> 08:56.980
Oh!

08:57.520 --> 09:02.800
That could be sort of what it's saying. Regardless, it is a food crime, what they've done. Nobody

09:02.800 --> 09:09.280
wants to be eating something and then change what they're eating to include one big nut.

09:09.280 --> 09:10.080
Correct.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.040
Do you know what I'm...

09:11.040 --> 09:11.440
Yes.

09:11.440 --> 09:11.920
Right.

09:11.920 --> 09:16.720
No matter how much you love nuts, and please don't tweet at me about how much you love nuts,

09:16.720 --> 09:21.200
I'm saying that you hit the middle and there's a little jelly in there, amazing. You hit

09:21.200 --> 09:25.280
the middle, there's a little chocolate kiss, amazing. You hit the middle and there's a

09:25.280 --> 09:25.680
nut?

09:25.680 --> 09:30.240
There's one big nut, and you chop the nut up and mix it in. Okay, now I'm eating a

09:30.240 --> 09:36.880
nut cookie. I'm not eating a nut at the same time as the cookie. Do you know what I mean?

09:36.880 --> 09:38.320
Nobody wants this.

09:38.320 --> 09:38.720
A nut?

09:38.720 --> 09:40.000
A whole nut?

09:40.000 --> 09:46.800
A nut? Now, here's what you could do. You could take a little bit after one of the greatest

09:46.800 --> 09:52.240
artists of all time, Bob Ross, and adopt yourself a pet squirrel. Bring that pet squirrel with

09:52.240 --> 09:56.800
you. You eat the cookie. You hand that squirrel the nut. That's a treat for both of you.

09:57.760 --> 09:58.560
That's good.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.560
And a fun affectation.

10:00.560 --> 10:01.600
That's why Bob had it.

10:02.240 --> 10:04.480
Yep. Bob hated nuts.

10:04.480 --> 10:10.960
This professor's bringing in cookies for critique. Maybe they should get in on the fun. In the

10:10.960 --> 10:15.360
spirit of critique, I'd like to give you some mild feedback on your cookies.

10:15.360 --> 10:15.600
Yeah?

10:16.240 --> 10:22.000
The cookie parts we're all wild about, but I talked to our entire class, had a meeting.

10:22.000 --> 10:28.480
Oh, oh, oh, okay. Go to them and say our entire class had a discussion. You must do this in

10:28.480 --> 10:33.840
private. Our entire class had a discussion and I've been nominated to be the spokesperson.

10:33.840 --> 10:39.760
We don't like your whack cookies, except all of it. We do like, but the nut part, got to

10:39.760 --> 10:42.720
go, Kiyosabe. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

10:42.720 --> 10:45.920
Where did you even find a nut that huge?

10:45.920 --> 10:47.200
Because no one wants it.

10:47.760 --> 10:52.320
But the problem with that, Justin, is if you're critiquing the cookie with the nut the same

10:52.320 --> 10:57.280
way one might critique a painting, it's basically what you're saying is, I really love the frame

10:57.280 --> 11:03.520
around it, but right there in the center where you put paint, I hate that part. I like the

11:03.520 --> 11:05.360
cookie that frames the nut, you see.

11:05.360 --> 11:08.720
You're being so obtuse, Travis. That's absolutely not the same thing.

11:08.720 --> 11:14.240
Is the nut not the paint in this nut where he's taken cookie and he's put his spin on

11:14.240 --> 11:15.760
it with nut?

11:15.760 --> 11:20.320
It really is kind of like an inversion of what you just said, Travis, because the art

11:20.320 --> 11:26.640
is the cookie and then the frame is in the middle. That is as wild, like if a painting

11:26.640 --> 11:28.720
did that, that is what this teacher has done.

11:28.720 --> 11:31.920
Y'all, that would be good art right there.

11:31.920 --> 11:38.480
It's just some thin paint around a big thing of wood and you'd be like, I flipped them.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.400
What do you think about this?

11:40.400 --> 11:41.360
Does this mean something?

11:41.360 --> 11:42.560
Is this art for you?

11:43.360 --> 11:45.120
I'm the first one to have flipped them.

11:45.680 --> 11:48.480
I'm the first one to do that, so that's for sure art.

11:48.480 --> 11:50.000
Nobody else has flipped them before.

11:50.560 --> 11:51.760
I have a yahoo.

11:51.760 --> 11:54.160
Did you guys hear about the banana art?

11:54.160 --> 11:54.660
Yeah.

11:55.840 --> 11:56.720
It's crazy, right?

11:56.720 --> 11:57.200
What?

11:57.200 --> 11:57.760
Thanks, Travis.

11:57.760 --> 12:04.160
Yeah. Hey, I thought I was one-twoing your joke, big dog.

12:05.520 --> 12:06.320
Banana art.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.600
Yeah, I heard about this.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.040
Let's see what Justin goes through.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.400
Everybody buckle up.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.720
Justin's about to make an observation.

12:12.720 --> 12:18.400
When someone asks a question about have you heard of something, saying yes kills the-

12:18.400 --> 12:20.160
I'm saying it's the end of it.

12:20.160 --> 12:24.400
Yes, I've heard of it and I can't wait to hear your humorous observation about the banana,

12:24.400 --> 12:25.040
Justin.

12:25.040 --> 12:29.680
The implication is yes, I've heard of it and there's no reason for you to recap it.

12:29.680 --> 12:30.160
So we can't actually summon-

12:30.160 --> 12:31.200
Griffin hasn't heard about it.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.000
I got your back.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.720
Hey, Griffin, you gotta hear what Justin's about to say.

12:34.720 --> 12:35.840
It's so funny and-

12:35.840 --> 12:37.280
Oh, about the banana art?

12:37.280 --> 12:38.400
I'm already aware.

12:39.840 --> 12:44.640
Please go on because the third party in this group doesn't know about the banana art.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.880
Artist in Miami got a banana.

12:46.880 --> 12:50.480
He taped it to a wall and he priced it at $120,000.

12:51.440 --> 12:52.720
This is excellent.

12:52.720 --> 12:53.760
We're all agreed.

12:53.760 --> 12:55.040
That is good.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.880
It's art, right?

12:56.880 --> 12:57.760
Yeah, that's art.

12:57.760 --> 13:04.880
Then another cat came in and he ate the extremely expensive art banana off the wall.

13:06.880 --> 13:09.360
And his quote when he said it is,

13:09.360 --> 13:11.200
Maurizio, it's a good banana-

13:11.200 --> 13:12.160
That's the artist's name.

13:12.160 --> 13:14.880
Maurizio, it's a good banana, I have to say.

13:19.120 --> 13:20.160
I don't know if that was part-

13:21.280 --> 13:22.640
Okay, so here's a wild thing.

13:22.640 --> 13:28.880
The second guy who ate the banana is a performance artist and he ate the original art.

13:29.360 --> 13:30.880
Can you do that?

13:30.880 --> 13:31.280
Yeah.

13:31.280 --> 13:37.200
Because I don't think you're allowed to just make your art around a different art.

13:37.200 --> 13:41.040
Like, can you eat something else art to say that's art now?

13:41.040 --> 13:42.880
I just farted on Starry Night.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.200
So now who's the artist?

13:45.200 --> 13:46.240
Not you?

13:46.240 --> 13:49.440
I just did a big punch through water lilies, so-

13:49.440 --> 13:50.480
That's something.

13:50.480 --> 13:51.600
That's something.

13:51.600 --> 13:52.400
That's art.

13:52.400 --> 13:53.120
That's art.

13:53.120 --> 13:55.280
I have a Yahoo that was sent in by like 50 different people.

13:55.280 --> 13:55.920
Thanks, everyone.

13:55.920 --> 13:58.000
It's Yahoo Answers user Jah who asks,

13:59.120 --> 14:01.520
is dirt a spice?

14:02.960 --> 14:03.760
Huh?

14:03.760 --> 14:06.240
Is dirt, comma, a spice?

14:07.120 --> 14:09.040
You know how all spices come from the ground?

14:09.040 --> 14:09.920
Well, so does dirt.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.400
I don't see why we're not using it to season our food.

14:13.680 --> 14:18.080
I mean, I guess in a very broad sense, all spice comes from the ground

14:18.080 --> 14:24.560
because, like, it grows on plants, a lot of it, which comes out of the ground, I suppose.

14:25.040 --> 14:28.000
Yeah, dirt's just a, you know, bed for a plant.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.160
But a strong case could be made that salt is dirt.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.880
Salt is rock, right?

14:34.880 --> 14:36.960
Yeah, it's like a little rock.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.040
I mean, dirt is just small rock, right?

14:41.520 --> 14:43.440
You lost me there, Trav.

14:43.440 --> 14:44.560
There you didn't get me.

14:44.560 --> 14:46.480
Dirt is just ground up rock.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.560
I think it's different stuff.

14:48.560 --> 14:51.760
I think dirt is just really ground up rock.

14:51.760 --> 14:52.320
Are you sure?

14:52.880 --> 14:56.560
Hey, I'm not sure, Griffin, but I don't see why it wouldn't be.

14:56.560 --> 14:57.920
Well, shit, hold up.

14:57.920 --> 14:58.960
What else would it be?

14:58.960 --> 15:00.080
Ground up tree?

15:00.080 --> 15:01.680
It's probably ground up tree and plant.

15:01.680 --> 15:03.760
I mean, it's probably a combination of a lot of things.

15:03.760 --> 15:06.480
I'm just saying that there's probably some ground up rock in there.

15:06.480 --> 15:10.320
I'm just saying there was somebody who got this crunchy white stuff

15:10.320 --> 15:14.400
and put it on some chips in caveman days and ate it and was like,

15:14.400 --> 15:16.720
that one is a spice.

15:16.720 --> 15:18.480
Yeah, keep going with that.

15:18.480 --> 15:19.760
Grand announcement.

15:19.760 --> 15:22.160
This one is a spice, but then they got-

15:22.160 --> 15:24.400
The white hard dirt, that's spice.

15:24.400 --> 15:25.200
That's spice.

15:26.080 --> 15:26.960
That one's spice.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.240
Let me try this red flower.

15:28.240 --> 15:28.960
Grind that up.

15:28.960 --> 15:30.400
Ooh, it hurt my mouth.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.800
That one's spice too, I decided.

15:33.920 --> 15:36.080
That's what I'm calling it, spice too.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.360
It's the second spice.

15:37.360 --> 15:40.000
Now let me get some of this brown stuff on my chips.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.800
Mmm, not a spice.

15:43.520 --> 15:46.160
Unfortunately, not a spice.

15:46.720 --> 15:50.320
Okay, but let me, I'm going to complicate this.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.160
If you have a big pile of dirt, right?

15:53.040 --> 15:58.480
And then you dump a jar of cinnamon into it and then you stir it all up.

15:58.480 --> 16:01.520
You don't say that you have dirt and cinnamon.

16:01.520 --> 16:03.120
You have dirt, right?

16:03.120 --> 16:06.560
Like you just have more different spicy dirt.

16:06.560 --> 16:07.440
That is true.

16:07.440 --> 16:10.560
Like it just has to become dirt.

16:10.560 --> 16:14.560
When reintegrated into dirt, it's dirt.

16:14.560 --> 16:17.840
Well, how much dirt would I have to put in the cinnamon jar

16:18.800 --> 16:20.720
before it stops being cinnamon juice?

16:20.720 --> 16:24.560
I was about to say one to one, but that's not true, right?

16:24.560 --> 16:27.760
Like there, I think that there would be, what is the-

16:27.760 --> 16:30.400
I could put a little bit of dirt and some cinnamon

16:30.400 --> 16:33.840
and I think I would still eat the cinnamon if pressed.

16:33.840 --> 16:34.080
Right.

16:34.080 --> 16:34.320
Right?

16:34.320 --> 16:36.960
Like, but what is the amount?

16:36.960 --> 16:38.960
Oh, this is a fun game.

16:39.760 --> 16:43.920
Is how dirty just would it have to be for you to not want it anymore?

16:43.920 --> 16:46.960
It helps because the visual of cinnamon blends in.

16:46.960 --> 16:49.840
Whereas if this was like very fine, yes.

16:49.840 --> 16:54.160
If this was fine salt and you threw some like really dark dirt in there,

16:54.160 --> 16:55.200
I'm like, oh, I can see it.

16:55.200 --> 16:55.840
That's gross.

16:57.040 --> 17:00.160
Umami is all the rage.

17:00.880 --> 17:01.120
Thanks.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.280
It's all the rage right now.

17:03.280 --> 17:04.480
It's just dirt.

17:04.480 --> 17:05.920
People don't like sour.

17:05.920 --> 17:07.360
People don't like sweet.

17:07.360 --> 17:11.280
Spicy hurts our tongue now and everybody wants to talk about umami.

17:11.280 --> 17:16.800
And so they're doing, they're trying the fish and squishing mushrooms.

17:16.800 --> 17:17.360
They're making the hamburgers.

17:17.360 --> 17:18.800
They're making the hamburgers.

17:20.800 --> 17:25.360
They spin of the pizza and they're making it so umami.

17:25.920 --> 17:28.160
It's really a matter of time, right?

17:28.160 --> 17:36.080
Before we just scoop up scoop fulls of this brown ground up tree stuff.

17:36.080 --> 17:37.440
That's my new flavor.

17:37.440 --> 17:38.320
Ew, daddy.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.720
And it's just gross.

17:40.720 --> 17:42.240
And it's a gross flavor.

17:42.240 --> 17:43.840
You have sour, you got sweet.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.160
You got, I don't know, the other ones.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.760
And then you have savory and the umami.

17:47.760 --> 17:50.000
I mean, you have gross and you call it ew, daddy.

17:51.120 --> 17:52.560
That's a good point, Travis.

17:52.560 --> 17:55.360
You don't say, like, if I eat something really raunchy,

17:55.360 --> 17:57.120
I don't say it's like sour or sweet.

17:57.120 --> 18:00.000
I just say, like, ugh, it sucks.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.240
Yeah, this is a really gross flavor.

18:02.240 --> 18:03.760
Ew, daddy.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.880
Why can't gross be a flavor, right?

18:07.680 --> 18:08.400
Right, yeah.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.600
Nobody's like, oh, I accidentally ate goat barf.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.600
It could have used more sugar.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.920
It's like, that is irredeemable.

18:15.920 --> 18:19.360
It has a new term, which is ew, daddy.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.120
Okay, all right, it begs the question.

18:23.120 --> 18:27.040
If you have, let's say, goat barf, right?

18:27.040 --> 18:29.760
And you have goat barf and it's fucking repellent.

18:30.320 --> 18:32.560
The fact that you don't assign a flavor,

18:32.560 --> 18:34.720
if you assign any flavor to it,

18:34.720 --> 18:36.720
the implication is that with an addition

18:36.720 --> 18:39.200
of enough other flavors, it could be good.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.840
It's like, it's, oh, it's bitter.

18:41.840 --> 18:44.720
Well, if you add some sugar and salt and sour,

18:44.720 --> 18:45.920
maybe it'd be good then.

18:45.920 --> 18:48.480
No, it's not, because it's not any of the flavors.

18:48.480 --> 18:49.360
It's ew, daddy.

18:49.360 --> 18:50.400
It's ew, daddy.

18:50.400 --> 18:50.800
No.

18:50.800 --> 18:51.680
Ew, daddy.

18:51.680 --> 18:54.400
You serve up goat barf on Top Chef,

18:54.400 --> 18:56.400
Tom Colicchio would be like,

18:56.400 --> 18:58.240
did you taste this before you sent it out?

18:58.240 --> 19:02.320
And you'd have to be like, no, Tom, you fucking pervert.

19:03.760 --> 19:05.120
It's fucking foul.

19:05.120 --> 19:07.760
Hey, Justin, did you taste the back of this

19:07.760 --> 19:10.240
Nintendo Switch cartridge before you brought it out?

19:10.240 --> 19:11.520
Because it's ew, daddy.

19:12.240 --> 19:13.840
Thank you, that's what I was going for.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.240
That would be good, because then when someone's like,

19:16.240 --> 19:19.200
this food is gross, you'd be like, yes, got them.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.080
Got them, did it.

19:20.080 --> 19:21.600
How do I-

19:21.600 --> 19:24.800
Welcome to my themed garbage pail kids restaurant.

19:24.800 --> 19:28.160
How do I get people to notice that I'm great at Sudoku?

19:28.160 --> 19:29.520
It's like they don't even care.

19:29.520 --> 19:31.040
That's from Dean from Ohio.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.520
I care, Dean.

19:33.520 --> 19:34.560
We all care, Dean.

19:34.560 --> 19:35.840
Here's the thing, right?

19:35.840 --> 19:36.960
There are many skills.

19:37.840 --> 19:42.640
The world is unfair, because, oh, somebody runs so fast?

19:42.640 --> 19:43.520
Super cool.

19:43.520 --> 19:44.640
Everybody loves that.

19:44.640 --> 19:47.440
Oh, they're so, I do a Sudoku real fast?

19:48.000 --> 19:48.640
Nothing.

19:48.640 --> 19:52.000
No one's taking my picture to put on a magazine or whatever.

19:52.560 --> 19:54.960
I've been struggling with this lately,

19:55.520 --> 19:58.800
because I'm getting good at Rubik's Cubes,

19:59.840 --> 20:02.160
and I have them littered all around my home.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.760
I have noticed that.

20:03.760 --> 20:08.000
And the problem is, it's very hard.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.080
So here's the way you could tell.

20:10.800 --> 20:12.880
There's limited ways you can communicate

20:12.880 --> 20:15.280
that you're getting pretty good at the Rubik's Cube.

20:15.280 --> 20:18.080
Here's a list of them, because I researched this thoroughly.

20:18.080 --> 20:21.360
At this point, one, say it on a podcast.

20:21.360 --> 20:22.080
No one cares.

20:22.720 --> 20:26.960
Two, leave unsolved Rubik's Cubes around your home,

20:27.680 --> 20:31.200
and then when someone is nearby,

20:31.200 --> 20:34.960
you begin solving it and just hope to fucking God

20:34.960 --> 20:37.520
that they somehow can maintain attention

20:37.520 --> 20:39.840
on you solving the Rubik's Cube

20:39.840 --> 20:41.920
for long enough for you to get to the solution.

20:42.560 --> 20:44.960
Because if they look over and you just have

20:44.960 --> 20:47.840
a solved Rubik's Cube in your hand, who gives a shit?

20:47.840 --> 20:49.760
Maybe it was solved before.

20:49.760 --> 20:51.440
They have to be there for the process,

20:51.440 --> 20:53.360
and no one wants to watch it.

20:53.360 --> 20:55.760
But at least then, Justin, you have the benefit

20:55.760 --> 20:57.040
of easy color.

20:58.160 --> 20:59.600
You can look at a Rubik's Cube

20:59.600 --> 21:01.920
and see if it's correctly solved or not.

21:01.920 --> 21:06.000
Whereas if you slam a Sudoku in 45 seconds,

21:06.000 --> 21:07.680
you can hold it up and say, I did it.

21:07.680 --> 21:11.360
And unless that person wants to check your math

21:11.360 --> 21:15.040
and make sure that all the numbers are in the correct spot,

21:15.040 --> 21:16.560
they don't give two shits.

21:16.560 --> 21:21.840
It doesn't matter, even if you did it in one second.

21:21.840 --> 21:24.000
If I was sitting next to you on the plane

21:24.000 --> 21:26.160
and you popped out your number two pencil

21:26.160 --> 21:30.080
and got out the hard Sudoku from the Washington Post

21:31.360 --> 21:33.200
and you cleared your throat super loud

21:33.200 --> 21:34.800
so that I had to look over at you,

21:34.800 --> 21:36.880
and I watched you solve the Sudoku

21:36.880 --> 21:40.000
in one and a half seconds, and you hold it up

21:40.000 --> 21:43.280
and be like, holy shit, did you see that?

21:43.280 --> 21:47.040
I would be like, yeah, it's a child's number game.

21:49.680 --> 21:52.320
I guess you solved the child's number game.

21:52.320 --> 21:55.680
I have so much of my own shit going on

21:55.680 --> 21:57.280
in my own head right now

21:57.280 --> 21:59.840
that it's hard for me to get excited, Justin,

21:59.840 --> 22:02.880
about your child's color shape

22:02.880 --> 22:04.480
that you like to twist and spin

22:05.040 --> 22:07.600
because I have sort of other more engaging,

22:07.600 --> 22:08.720
important stuff going on.

22:08.720 --> 22:11.760
And by me, I mean us, all of us, the rest of us.

22:11.760 --> 22:15.120
But people like to celebrate when people are good

22:15.120 --> 22:16.960
at the child's ball throwing game

22:16.960 --> 22:19.120
or the child's ball kicking game.

22:19.120 --> 22:21.040
Why can't we be good at child's paper games?

22:21.040 --> 22:23.040
Because those are badass and cool to see.

22:23.600 --> 22:25.760
What if I did a Sudoku in a really cool way?

22:26.560 --> 22:28.960
Not fucking possible.

22:28.960 --> 22:32.240
I'm doing it on my bicycle, no hands on the handlebar

22:32.240 --> 22:34.320
because they're busy with the number two pencil.

22:34.320 --> 22:35.120
It's reckless.

22:35.120 --> 22:35.840
It's reckless.

22:35.840 --> 22:37.120
That's just reckless.

22:37.120 --> 22:44.400
Yeah, now I'm the bad boy Sudoku.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.560
Travis, it is such an honor to have you

22:46.560 --> 22:50.160
on the show, the bad boy Sudoku, the Sudoku world.

22:50.160 --> 22:50.960
Fuck you.

22:52.880 --> 22:55.520
He, of course, remember Travis as the one who,

22:55.520 --> 22:57.040
when an opponent wasn't looking,

22:57.040 --> 23:00.160
reached in and wrote blue in one of the squares

23:00.160 --> 23:03.760
and they fucking brought the entire convention to its knees.

23:03.760 --> 23:06.960
It was a scandal writ large.

23:06.960 --> 23:07.520
Yep.

23:07.520 --> 23:10.880
And I remember that one time you leaned over

23:10.880 --> 23:13.440
to Kenny Numberman and bit his nose,

23:14.000 --> 23:15.760
cleaned the hell off his face.

23:15.760 --> 23:19.920
I do regret that because it turned out

23:19.920 --> 23:22.320
we weren't even competing at that point.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.240
No, you were on a ski lift.

23:26.240 --> 23:28.240
You guys were going on a ski trip together.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.760
And I bit his nose off.

23:29.760 --> 23:31.280
I thought there was a bug on it.

23:32.240 --> 23:33.840
That was pretty cool, man.

23:33.840 --> 23:34.320
Thank you.

23:34.320 --> 23:37.760
I remember when you brought a six pack of Coors

23:37.760 --> 23:39.440
to my grandpapa's funeral.

23:40.400 --> 23:42.640
I also regret that.

23:42.640 --> 23:46.560
I did appreciate how you put two Sudoku puzzles,

23:46.560 --> 23:50.400
one on each of his eyes while you sent him on his way

23:50.400 --> 23:51.760
across the River Styx.

23:52.320 --> 23:54.080
Well, the family paid me for that.

23:54.880 --> 23:56.320
You never think about that.

23:56.320 --> 23:58.080
The ferryman every once in a while is like,

23:58.080 --> 23:59.840
I got so many fucking coins, y'all.

23:59.840 --> 24:00.640
I'm good.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.880
Please send a Sudoku puzzle.

24:02.880 --> 24:04.800
Please send a Sudoku puzzle.

24:04.800 --> 24:06.320
It's so boring here.

24:06.320 --> 24:08.480
I just go back and forth on the river.

24:08.480 --> 24:09.520
Send a Sudoku.

24:10.160 --> 24:11.280
It's not a good puzzle.

24:12.240 --> 24:14.640
Well, you don't think the Sudoku is a good puzzle?

24:14.640 --> 24:15.140
No.

24:15.840 --> 24:18.000
It's quite a brain teaser.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.520
Would you rather do riddles, Griffin?

24:19.520 --> 24:20.720
Because we could do riddles.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.560
Don't you fuck with me.

24:22.560 --> 24:25.040
You know how they made a movie out of escape room,

24:25.040 --> 24:29.600
a horror movie where the teens got trapped in escape room

24:29.600 --> 24:31.200
and then they thought they were in the lobby,

24:31.200 --> 24:33.520
but it turns out this is the escape room

24:33.520 --> 24:35.440
and it is full of deadly traps.

24:35.440 --> 24:38.160
And it was based on escape rooms.

24:39.040 --> 24:40.800
Do you think they'll ever do that for Sudoku?

24:41.440 --> 24:44.480
Yeah, I've actually been working on a script for Sudoku

24:44.480 --> 24:47.040
and it's a university that teaches Sudoku

24:47.040 --> 24:48.960
and things get pretty ribald.

24:49.840 --> 24:50.880
That's funny.

24:50.880 --> 24:54.320
Yeah, the six and the nine are always next to each other,

24:54.320 --> 24:55.440
if you know what I mean.

24:55.440 --> 24:56.800
Hell yeah, dude.

24:56.800 --> 24:57.840
This is 69.

25:00.080 --> 25:00.960
What's that?

25:00.960 --> 25:02.160
It's a sex number.

25:02.880 --> 25:03.680
Why is that?

25:03.680 --> 25:05.360
It's because when you put them together,

25:05.360 --> 25:07.200
it looks like the six and the nine

25:07.200 --> 25:09.280
are orally pleasuring one another.

25:11.120 --> 25:12.000
Do you see it now?

25:12.800 --> 25:14.560
Look at it and squint like a magic eye.

25:15.120 --> 25:17.200
You know how we're all just genitals

25:17.200 --> 25:18.560
attached to one big mouth?

25:19.120 --> 25:20.000
You get it.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.600
Hey guys, 69 is nothing.

25:23.600 --> 25:24.800
That doesn't look like that.

25:25.520 --> 25:27.520
One person went, oh, a six and a nine together.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.840
That looks like two people orally pleasuring each other

25:29.840 --> 25:32.240
while curled up like a Sonic the Hedgehog.

25:32.240 --> 25:34.720
And another person was like, yeah, it does.

25:34.720 --> 25:36.080
Hey, guess what, gang?

25:36.080 --> 25:36.960
It doesn't.

25:36.960 --> 25:38.000
It wicked doesn't.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
If you had a seven and an L maybe.

25:40.800 --> 25:41.280
Maybe.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.080
The other thing is you can't even do that.

25:45.760 --> 25:46.260
Wait.

25:47.200 --> 25:49.440
You can't even do it now.

25:49.440 --> 25:50.240
It doesn't work.

25:51.120 --> 25:51.840
Justin's right.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.200
Where do the legs even go?

25:55.520 --> 25:56.800
What do you do with your pants?

25:56.800 --> 26:00.480
If I was to train 69 in the way that the numbers prescribed,

26:00.480 --> 26:04.480
I would have to put like my wife's entire lower body

26:04.480 --> 26:05.280
in my mouth.

26:05.280 --> 26:05.760
What?

26:05.760 --> 26:06.400
That's not-

26:06.400 --> 26:07.120
Wait, is that-

26:07.120 --> 26:08.000
Wait, is that not-

26:08.720 --> 26:10.080
Oh shit, Trav.

26:10.080 --> 26:11.360
We should go to the money zone.

26:11.360 --> 26:25.200
Hey, I want to tell you about me undies.

26:25.200 --> 26:26.400
Undies.

26:26.400 --> 26:28.960
We always talk about getting me undies for yourself,

26:28.960 --> 26:30.160
but you know what?

26:30.160 --> 26:32.000
It's the time for others.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.440
You need to think about putting clothes on other people's bodies.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.640
Me undies makes a great gift for someone you care about

26:40.640 --> 26:41.840
this holiday season.

26:41.840 --> 26:43.280
And it's not just underwear.

26:43.280 --> 26:45.360
They have all kinds of things.

26:45.360 --> 26:52.320
You got comfy pants, t-shirts, robes, slippers,

26:52.320 --> 26:56.480
all kinds of stuff, including a baby body suit.

26:56.480 --> 26:57.760
Adorable.

26:58.400 --> 27:00.640
And of course, all of their clothes are cozy.

27:01.520 --> 27:04.800
And they have sizes XS through 4XL.

27:05.920 --> 27:08.240
And it's three times softer than cotton.

27:08.240 --> 27:09.360
You know it is.

27:09.360 --> 27:10.640
So you're going to want to check it out.

27:10.640 --> 27:14.400

27:14.400 --> 27:18.960

slash my brother, that's meundies.com slash my brother.

27:24.960 --> 27:27.280
Going to the post office is hell.

27:27.280 --> 27:27.600
Okay.

27:29.760 --> 27:31.200
Especially this time of year.

27:31.760 --> 27:35.120
It can be really, the holidays are tough on everybody

27:35.120 --> 27:37.520
and mostly because of how much you have to go to the post office.

27:37.520 --> 27:41.600
Which is to be fair, that's also true of going outside

27:41.600 --> 27:43.200
anywhere at all ever.

27:43.920 --> 27:44.960
That's fair, Travis.

27:44.960 --> 27:48.960
Stamps.com is going to save you from having to go to post office

27:49.520 --> 27:54.480
and save you the money that you would have spent on things

27:54.480 --> 27:56.560
at post office because they've got discounts,

27:56.560 --> 27:58.320
the Stamps.com people do.

27:58.320 --> 28:02.720
You use your computer, you'll print official US postage 24-7.

28:02.720 --> 28:03.280
That's right.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.280
Once you start, you will be printing postage

28:07.280 --> 28:10.720
every waking moment of your life for any letter, any package,

28:10.720 --> 28:14.240
any class of mail, anywhere you want to send things.

28:14.240 --> 28:15.440
But it's worth it.

28:15.440 --> 28:16.400
It's worth it.

28:16.400 --> 28:17.920
It's a new lifestyle.

28:17.920 --> 28:20.560
This is a lifestyle brand, Stamps.com.

28:20.560 --> 28:23.040
Once your mail is ready, you just hand it to your mail carrier

28:23.040 --> 28:24.400
or you drop it in a mailbox.

28:24.400 --> 28:27.600
It's no wonder over 700,000 small businesses

28:27.600 --> 28:30.880
already use Stamps.com and folks, that's basically a million.

28:31.520 --> 28:33.520

29:05.680 --> 29:08.000
Have you ever watched a movie so bad

29:08.000 --> 29:10.160
you just needed to talk to somebody about it?

29:10.160 --> 29:12.720
Well, here at the Flophouse, we watch a bad movie

29:12.720 --> 29:13.840
and then talk about it.

29:13.840 --> 29:15.280
Yeah, you don't have to do anything.

29:15.280 --> 29:17.040
We'll watch it and we'll talk it.

29:17.040 --> 29:18.080
We do the hard work.

29:18.080 --> 29:21.520
Featuring the beautiful vocal talents of Dan McCoy.

29:21.520 --> 29:23.200
Stuart Wellington.

29:23.200 --> 29:25.680
And me, America's Rascal, Elliot Kalin.

29:25.680 --> 29:28.560
New episodes every other Saturday at MaximumFun.org

29:28.560 --> 29:30.880
or wherever you get your podcasts, dude.

29:30.880 --> 29:32.160
Bye-bye.

29:32.160 --> 29:32.660
Bye-bye.

29:32.660 --> 29:44.560
I want to munch.

29:44.560 --> 29:45.060
Squad.

29:45.060 --> 29:49.560
I want to munch.

29:49.560 --> 29:50.520
Squad.

29:50.520 --> 29:53.480
Squad.

29:53.480 --> 29:54.520
Hello, welcome to Munch Squad.

29:54.520 --> 29:56.120
It's podcast after podcast about the latest

29:56.120 --> 29:58.200
and greatest in brand eating.

29:58.200 --> 30:04.040
I have, if it so please the court, I just have a couple.

30:04.040 --> 30:07.080
Two to three that I'd love to get through.

30:07.080 --> 30:09.480
Because I don't want a new year to begin

30:09.480 --> 30:13.320
and still have stuff on my desk that I have to clear off.

30:13.320 --> 30:14.600
Is that OK with everybody?

30:14.600 --> 30:16.200
Edible.

30:16.200 --> 30:19.000
This is our sub-segment of Munch Squad.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.240
It's our CBD update, which I've decided

30:21.240 --> 30:23.000
to start calling CBD's nuts.

30:23.000 --> 30:28.680
Oh, I get it.

30:28.680 --> 30:31.960
Welcome to the party Edible Arrangements.

30:31.960 --> 30:36.360
The world's largest franchiser of fresh fruit arrangements

30:36.360 --> 30:39.560
has officially debuted a new Incredible Edibles hemp

30:39.560 --> 30:44.480
derived CBD product line, including smoothies

30:44.480 --> 30:47.800
and chocolate dipped fruit.

30:47.800 --> 30:50.080
It's from Incredible Edibles, a company which

30:50.080 --> 30:55.240
focuses on supplying CBD with traceability and authenticity

30:55.240 --> 30:58.280
from the hemp farm to the finished product.

30:58.280 --> 31:00.120
That's right, folks.

31:00.120 --> 31:02.840
Farm to smoothie CBD.

31:02.840 --> 31:05.480
We've finally fucking done it.

31:05.480 --> 31:10.600
Quote from Tariq Freed, the founder and CEO

31:10.600 --> 31:14.000
of Edible Arrangements.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.680
Consumers are showing an increasing demand

31:15.680 --> 31:17.440
for CBD products.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.020
And now is the perfect time for us

31:19.020 --> 31:21.960
to make our mark on this flourishing industry.

31:21.960 --> 31:24.240
We've always prided ourselves on our knack.

31:24.240 --> 31:28.800
I just want to say, hey, good euphemism for cash in.

31:28.800 --> 31:30.640
Yeah, we have always prided ourselves

31:30.640 --> 31:32.260
on our knack for innovation.

31:32.260 --> 31:34.500
And we continue to do so with the introduction

31:34.500 --> 31:38.300
of new menu innovations for fresh and healthy alternatives.

31:38.300 --> 31:40.560
In the case of Incredible Edible CBD products,

31:40.560 --> 31:46.240
the alternative we now offer is high quality traceable CBD

31:46.240 --> 31:50.080
with a focus on health, not high.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.600
I'd like to go back to where it's

31:52.600 --> 31:55.000
talking about increasing demand.

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
Am I to believe, Tariq, that at least one time

31:59.000 --> 32:02.720
in human existence, someone blew into the doors

32:02.720 --> 32:04.720
of an Edible Arrangements and just shouted,

32:04.720 --> 32:07.880
like, I need this fruit to have CBD in it?

32:07.880 --> 32:09.800
Hey, you said edible, right?

32:09.800 --> 32:11.500
You want our chocolate dipped strawberries

32:11.500 --> 32:12.680
to get you fucked up?

32:12.680 --> 32:14.680
No, it's for health.

32:14.680 --> 32:15.840
Not high.

32:15.840 --> 32:17.600
OK.

32:17.600 --> 32:22.880
Red Lobster has made a Cheddar Bay Biscuit sweater.

32:22.880 --> 32:24.480
It's for the holidays.

32:24.480 --> 32:27.280
And it's got little lobsters on it

32:27.280 --> 32:29.400
and Cheddar Bay Biscuits on it.

32:29.400 --> 32:33.160
And it's got a special insulated pocket

32:33.160 --> 32:35.520
to help keep your Cheddar Bay Biscuits warm.

32:35.520 --> 32:38.680
To help steal your Cheddar Bay Biscuits, we should be clear.

32:38.680 --> 32:39.640
Yes.

32:39.640 --> 32:40.440
How big?

32:40.440 --> 32:43.360
Hey, Juice, how big a pocket we talking?

32:43.360 --> 32:46.120
It says, they're kept warm to perfect.

32:46.120 --> 32:47.960
I'm looking at a picture of a woman

32:47.960 --> 32:49.880
with four biscuits in her sweater pocket.

32:49.880 --> 32:50.360
Fuck yeah.

32:50.360 --> 32:51.000
That's good.

32:51.000 --> 32:51.500
That's good.

32:51.500 --> 32:53.600
I was worried it would just be a single serve.

32:53.600 --> 32:57.600
For those looking to turn heads at their office party,

32:57.600 --> 33:00.080
I think that you would turn heads in this sweater,

33:00.080 --> 33:02.880
but you'd turn them back and forth in kind of a sad way.

33:02.880 --> 33:05.320
You know?

33:05.320 --> 33:07.320
You would oscillate heads.

33:07.320 --> 33:08.000
Right.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.520
Those looking to oscillate heads in a slow fashion

33:11.520 --> 33:16.840
or give an unforgettable gift to a seafood-loving one.

33:16.840 --> 33:19.920
It says, a seafood-loving loved one.

33:19.920 --> 33:22.040
Just do it with the first draft on this one, huh?

33:22.040 --> 33:23.280
Red Lobster, OK.

33:23.280 --> 33:25.360
Our Cheddar Bay Biscuits, a good holiday sweater.

33:25.360 --> 33:27.600
Originally, the copy said, a seafood-loved one.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.800
And they're like, that doesn't seem right.

33:29.800 --> 33:32.960
It's guaranteed to help holiday enthusiasts

33:32.960 --> 33:38.400
slay S-L-E-I-G-H all season long.

33:38.400 --> 33:41.720
I'm trying not to fill up before I get to my shrimp scampi

33:41.720 --> 33:43.520
sweater that I also ordered.

33:43.520 --> 33:46.160
So I'm going to pass on these.

33:46.160 --> 33:46.920
That's fair enough.

33:46.920 --> 33:47.760
It's $40.

33:47.760 --> 33:50.680
You can buy it if you don't value your life.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.560
Last one real quick.

33:52.560 --> 33:55.240
And I want to say thank you to Robin for this one.

33:55.240 --> 33:58.480
The Michael Jordan Steakhouse is offering a limited time Space

33:58.480 --> 34:00.080
Jam menu.

34:00.080 --> 34:03.760
Boy, if you're a die-hard Space Jam fan like many of us

34:03.760 --> 34:05.680
in Chicago, you will be thrilled to hear

34:05.680 --> 34:08.320
that Michael Jordan Steakhouse is offering limited time

34:08.320 --> 34:10.680
Space Jam-inspired menu.

34:10.680 --> 34:13.800
From now until April 13, 2020, you

34:13.800 --> 34:18.040
can try a Space Jam-inspired meal during every Chicago Bulls

34:18.040 --> 34:19.680
home game.

34:19.680 --> 34:22.040
For anyone who's ever wanted to be like Mike,

34:22.040 --> 34:24.360
this meal will take you back to the Michael Jordan days

34:24.360 --> 34:27.640
and give anyone who tries it a feeling of nostalgia

34:27.640 --> 34:30.480
and a chance to eat like Mike.

34:30.480 --> 34:36.200
That would be a fucking wild, wild reaction to this meal.

34:36.200 --> 34:41.560
The new item, titled Mike's Secret Stuff, is no joke.

34:41.560 --> 34:44.360
It includes a Space Jam burger.

34:44.360 --> 34:46.520
It consists of a 10-ounce beef patty that's

34:46.520 --> 34:49.600
stacked with BBQ braised pork belly, dill

34:49.600 --> 34:52.400
pickled, stout mustard, pickled onions,

34:52.400 --> 34:54.280
and aged cheddar cheese.

34:54.280 --> 34:56.160
What does that have to do with Space Jam?

34:56.160 --> 35:00.600
Well, you eat it off of Wayne Knight's nude body.

35:00.600 --> 35:03.440
If that's not enough for you, the menu,

35:03.440 --> 35:05.800
how could it not be enough?

35:05.800 --> 35:11.000
And the menu item also comes as a combo with hand-cut fries

35:11.000 --> 35:14.520
and a Mike's Secret Stuff salted caramel milkshake.

35:14.520 --> 35:18.240
Hey, Mike, what's your secret stuff?

35:18.240 --> 35:20.000
Well, friend, it turns out it's fucking

35:20.000 --> 35:22.480
salted caramel milkshakes.

35:22.480 --> 35:25.400
Help me deliver on the b-ball court.

35:25.400 --> 35:30.200
The FDA must have a law preventing anyone

35:30.200 --> 35:34.600
from advertising, quote, secret stuff on their food menus.

35:34.600 --> 35:38.800
Yes, because it can cover any number of sins.

35:38.800 --> 35:43.080
What makes me mad is that they called the menu item, which

35:43.080 --> 35:45.960
is a burger, Mike's Secret Stuff,

35:45.960 --> 35:49.720
and then they called the milkshake Mike's Secret

35:49.720 --> 35:50.480
Stuff.

35:50.480 --> 35:52.520
Like, you were so close.

35:52.520 --> 35:54.920
If you had just waited, you could have gotten it

35:54.920 --> 35:56.400
into a drink form.

35:56.400 --> 35:58.000
But no, you had to call the burger.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.760
You can't just call them both Mike's Secret Stuff.

36:00.760 --> 36:03.240
Michael Jordan was not beginning games

36:03.240 --> 36:06.960
by eating a fucking cheeseburger.

36:06.960 --> 36:09.920
Mike has a lot of secrets, Justin.

36:09.920 --> 36:13.640
And then a milkshake to wash it down.

36:13.640 --> 36:16.800
That's not how Mike began his games.

36:16.800 --> 36:20.920
I just, I'm bothered by something

36:20.920 --> 36:26.040
that seems so thematic that then once you peel one layer back,

36:26.040 --> 36:29.400
has zero theme at all.

36:29.400 --> 36:32.360
Like, you could put some fig jam on there.

36:32.360 --> 36:34.280
And I would have been like, OK, done.

36:34.280 --> 36:35.360
Now you're fucking talking.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.920
But there's nothing.

36:36.920 --> 36:40.600
I would sooner believe that Mike's Secret Stuff is fig jam.

36:40.600 --> 36:44.140
If I just went back in the locker room

36:44.140 --> 36:47.040
and saw Michael Jordan eating piles of fig jam

36:47.040 --> 36:50.080
from a jar with a spoon, that would be more plausible to me.

36:50.080 --> 36:54.200
Producing eggs from some sort of sack.

36:54.200 --> 36:57.080
The executive chef of Michael Jordan's steakhouse,

36:57.080 --> 36:59.680
Craig Cooper, is thrilled to be offering

36:59.680 --> 37:02.720
Bulls and Michael Jordan fans alike this opportunity.

37:02.720 --> 37:03.720
A burger!

37:03.720 --> 37:07.040
A burger and milkshake with fries!

37:07.040 --> 37:10.240
Quote, we're doing it with really great ingredients

37:10.240 --> 37:11.640
and going over the top.

37:11.640 --> 37:15.520
Yeah, I mean, it would be better than if you went with,

37:15.520 --> 37:21.000
we're doing it with bad food that we can't sell otherwise.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.480
If they wanted to be really thematic,

37:22.480 --> 37:24.920
the drink should just be like a glass of water.

37:24.920 --> 37:28.240
But then you drink it and you beat the monsters.

37:28.240 --> 37:30.880
Michael's Secret Stuff is hydration and plenty of sleep.

37:30.880 --> 37:33.600
We were, this is continuing the quote,

37:33.600 --> 37:35.400
we were inspired by Space Jam.

37:35.400 --> 37:36.960
And who knows?

37:36.960 --> 37:38.500
Maybe the Mike's Secret Stuff shake

37:38.500 --> 37:40.040
will be enough to bring the Bulls back

37:40.040 --> 37:41.800
to their Michael Jordan era prime.

37:41.800 --> 37:45.080
So Craig, just so I can be fucking clear,

37:45.080 --> 37:48.760
you are saying that maybe if the entire Bulls franchise

37:48.760 --> 37:52.720
drank a salted caramel milkshake before the game began,

37:52.720 --> 37:55.200
they might launch back to prominence.

37:55.200 --> 37:56.520
Is that where we're going with this?

37:56.520 --> 37:58.280
Perhaps even stranger, Justin.

37:58.280 --> 37:59.560
What he is suggesting is,

37:59.560 --> 38:03.580
if some people in a restaurant drink the shake,

38:03.580 --> 38:06.640
the enjoyment of said shake might be enough

38:06.640 --> 38:11.640
to power a basketball team to victory, perhaps miles away.

38:11.840 --> 38:15.320
The thing, the fictional setting that Craig has created,

38:15.320 --> 38:18.360
yes, thank you, Travis, is not that the team,

38:18.360 --> 38:22.960
it's that a city would love a salted caramel milkshake

38:22.960 --> 38:25.360
so much that their favorite team

38:25.360 --> 38:26.940
would be good at basketball again.

38:26.940 --> 38:29.720
That is what Craig is, that's a good milkshake, Craig.

38:29.720 --> 38:30.560
Are you sure?

38:30.560 --> 38:31.960
Does it just have the regular things

38:31.960 --> 38:34.820
like salt and caramel and ice cream?

38:34.820 --> 38:36.800
Imagine if in Angels of the Outfield,

38:36.800 --> 38:39.660
the actual scenario had been that there were angels

38:39.660 --> 38:41.720
somewhere else in the city,

38:41.720 --> 38:44.400
and everyone was so excited about those angels

38:44.400 --> 38:46.280
that the baseball team won.

38:46.280 --> 38:48.760
And that's what's going on here.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.000
Angels a few blocks over.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.620
Yes, Angels at the Walmart,

38:52.620 --> 38:55.640
and the angels are just shopping, but everyone loves them.

38:55.640 --> 38:59.000
I would pay 200 American dollars

38:59.000 --> 39:02.440
for a Space Jam hamburger if-

39:02.440 --> 39:03.760
A Space Jam burger?

39:03.760 --> 39:05.680
A Space Jam burger.

39:05.680 --> 39:10.680
If Michael Jordan himself ran towards my table with it

39:10.720 --> 39:14.400
in his hand, no plate, and jumped way up in the air

39:14.400 --> 39:16.480
and dunked it right into my head,

39:16.480 --> 39:18.160
but then he picked me up off the ground

39:18.160 --> 39:20.680
where he flattened me, and he stands me up

39:20.680 --> 39:23.360
and dusts me off and says, do you want to come

39:23.360 --> 39:26.080
in the back with me and help me hurt the Monstars?

39:26.080 --> 39:31.080
And then me and him got to go back in the kitchen

39:31.240 --> 39:34.640
where he's got the Monstars captured,

39:34.640 --> 39:39.360
and then he and I hurt them because of how bad they were

39:39.360 --> 39:40.420
to the Looney Tunes.

39:41.480 --> 39:46.480
So in Space Jam 2, we can only assume that LeBron

39:46.480 --> 39:51.120
will drink LeBron's secret stuff.

39:51.120 --> 39:53.960
Now, as we all know, Michael Jordan's secret stuff

39:53.960 --> 39:57.440
was water, and LeBron's secret stuff,

39:57.440 --> 39:59.240
I'm assuming, will also be water.

39:59.240 --> 40:00.600
Maybe Sprite- At some point,

40:00.600 --> 40:03.800
the Looney Tunes must become suspicious

40:03.800 --> 40:05.920
of pro basketball players trying

40:05.920 --> 40:08.400
to sell them high-priced water.

40:08.400 --> 40:10.920
I mean, the other side of that, Justin, is that,

40:10.920 --> 40:13.480
and I'm not saying this about LeBron James, mind you,

40:13.480 --> 40:17.560
but that at some point, an NBA star gives them, say,

40:17.560 --> 40:21.320
anabolic steroids to make them successful at basketball,

40:21.320 --> 40:23.880
and they're like, finally, something that works.

40:23.880 --> 40:27.760
I do look forward to the inevitable Wayne Knight cameo

40:27.760 --> 40:29.920
and hearing a room full of seven-year-olds scream,

40:29.920 --> 40:31.840
who the fuck is that?

40:31.840 --> 40:34.360
Or just hearing them yell, Newman!

40:34.360 --> 40:39.260
Because that is a show that stretches beyond age.

40:39.260 --> 40:40.560
What will be more depressing,

40:40.560 --> 40:42.280
that the room full of seven-year-olds don't know

40:42.280 --> 40:43.880
who Wayne Knight is, or that they don't know

40:43.880 --> 40:45.080
who Michael Jordan is?

40:45.080 --> 40:46.200
Oh.

40:46.200 --> 40:48.560
Depends on if you're Michael Jordan or not.

40:48.560 --> 40:52.120
I could show it up in his kenga,

40:52.120 --> 40:57.120
ready to enjoy that great movie with his family,

40:57.320 --> 40:59.960
and he strides out of the screen

40:59.960 --> 41:02.520
with a bottle of his secret stuff,

41:02.520 --> 41:05.560
and is met with fucking silence

41:05.560 --> 41:07.840
by a room full of seven-year-olds.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.560
Is that a Fortnite guy?

41:09.560 --> 41:11.720
I have a Yahoo here that was sent in by Graham Roebuck.

41:11.720 --> 41:12.560
Thank you.

41:12.560 --> 41:14.880
It's from Yahoo Answers user, Nurbel, who asks,

41:15.800 --> 41:19.000
what would a witch even do with a cauldron?

41:19.000 --> 41:20.520
Good question.

41:20.520 --> 41:22.080
Why did witches have cauldrons?

41:22.080 --> 41:24.860
A cauldron holds a massive quantity of soup or stew,

41:24.860 --> 41:27.160
but they are a witch.

41:27.160 --> 41:28.740
How many people are they serving?

41:28.740 --> 41:31.080
It's not like they know a lot of people

41:31.080 --> 41:33.240
because they're witches and probably keep to themselves,

41:33.240 --> 41:35.800
and they didn't have refrigerators back then

41:35.800 --> 41:36.920
to save some for later.

41:36.920 --> 41:39.120
Seems like they would have wasted a lot of food.

41:39.120 --> 41:41.480
Okay, first, my dude, Covens.

41:41.480 --> 41:43.400
What do you mean witches don't know people?

41:43.400 --> 41:46.120
Inherently, witches are part of a big group.

41:46.120 --> 41:47.840
That's the thing, Covens.

41:47.840 --> 41:49.120
Come on, my dude.

41:49.120 --> 41:51.720
Someone's gonna draw it, your coven comes over,

41:51.720 --> 41:53.720
you've got a cauldron for one.

41:53.720 --> 41:56.040
Embarrassing, no thank you.

41:56.040 --> 41:58.800
A big cauldron, you can make one portion.

41:58.800 --> 42:01.520
A small cauldron, you can't make more than one portion.

42:01.520 --> 42:03.460
Options, buddy.

42:03.460 --> 42:04.600
Read a book.

42:04.600 --> 42:07.800
Whenever you do see

42:07.800 --> 42:12.800
a depiction of a witch with a cauldron

42:13.080 --> 42:14.760
who is stirring something up,

42:15.680 --> 42:20.360
my mind has never leapt to chili

42:21.280 --> 42:26.280
or beef stew or potatoes soup.

42:27.560 --> 42:30.000
It's always some sort of potion.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.520
Yes, am I alone in this?

42:31.520 --> 42:34.160
Well, chili can be a potion, Griffin.

42:34.160 --> 42:39.160
It's a kind of bean fart potion, sure.

42:39.640 --> 42:41.240
But then that brings up the question

42:41.240 --> 42:43.200
of how much potion do you need?

42:43.200 --> 42:44.280
Do potions go back?

42:44.280 --> 42:46.920
If a potion has an eye of newt in it,

42:46.920 --> 42:50.680
that I imagine would go bad after a bit.

42:50.680 --> 42:53.800
It has a perishable sort of object in it.

42:53.800 --> 42:55.640
That is, here's the thing though, Griffin.

42:55.640 --> 42:58.560
If you watch any movie with a witch building a potion,

42:58.560 --> 43:01.920
they have some kind of base potion in there, right?

43:01.920 --> 43:04.280
Because the cauldron's almost always full.

43:04.280 --> 43:06.560
And then when the person says,

43:06.560 --> 43:09.120
I need a powerful love spell or whatever,

43:09.120 --> 43:10.560
that's when they start throwing in

43:10.560 --> 43:11.400
the individual ingredients.

43:11.400 --> 43:13.400
It's a sourdough starter, essentially,

43:13.400 --> 43:14.400
is what you're suggesting.

43:14.400 --> 43:15.320
Okay.

43:15.320 --> 43:18.040
That there's some kind of base potion,

43:18.040 --> 43:20.340
a universal potion base,

43:20.340 --> 43:24.560
that then they can add specific ingredients to

43:24.560 --> 43:25.800
as soon as someone gets there.

43:25.800 --> 43:26.640
Because that's the thing.

43:26.640 --> 43:28.800
If a villager rolled up and said,

43:28.800 --> 43:31.880
I need a potion to punish my enemies,

43:31.880 --> 43:33.760
you wouldn't be like, okay, sit down.

43:33.760 --> 43:35.820
This thing holds 60 gallons.

43:35.820 --> 43:38.160
It's gonna take a while to heat up.

43:38.160 --> 43:39.120
You're gonna be here.

43:39.120 --> 43:40.800
That's like, you know, it's like a drug dealer

43:40.800 --> 43:43.080
hanging out with you while you make the deal,

43:43.080 --> 43:45.920
I assume, because I've watched TV and movies.

43:45.920 --> 43:49.720
They gotta have smaller cauldrons, right?

43:49.720 --> 43:52.360
Like, they're batch making all these.

43:52.360 --> 43:55.160
Well, you think they're just made of cauldrons, Justin?

43:55.160 --> 43:58.360
Well, they at least have another one for chili, right?

43:58.360 --> 44:02.680
We can agree that it's not the same cauldron, right,

44:02.680 --> 44:05.320
for chili and love spell potions.

44:05.320 --> 44:06.920
Oh no, that could go so bad.

44:06.920 --> 44:09.920
They very temporarily put in the stopper,

44:09.920 --> 44:12.460
dump the love spell potion into the bathtub,

44:12.460 --> 44:14.480
make the chili in the cauldron,

44:14.480 --> 44:16.600
edit up, share it with the friends,

44:16.600 --> 44:20.080
scoop the love spell potion back into the cauldron.

44:20.080 --> 44:23.120
After it's been cleaned, oops, it wasn't cleaned.

44:23.120 --> 44:25.040
I got ding-danged beans and onions

44:25.040 --> 44:26.680
in my love potion again.

44:26.680 --> 44:28.080
And it works even better.

44:28.080 --> 44:29.140
It works really good.

44:30.240 --> 44:32.000
Do you think witches ever get mad

44:32.000 --> 44:34.040
when somebody's like, I need a potion?

44:34.040 --> 44:37.000
Do you think the first thought the witch's head is always,

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
oh man, I gotta build a fire in the middle of my house?

44:40.000 --> 44:43.480
I really, this is where I sleep and live,

44:43.480 --> 44:45.520
and I don't wanna build a fire in the middle of my house,

44:45.520 --> 44:47.520
but I have to make the potion.

44:47.520 --> 44:48.480
Can I do it outside?

44:48.480 --> 44:50.060
No, it'll be contaminated.

44:50.060 --> 44:52.400
But the potions, and people don't like to hear this,

44:52.400 --> 44:53.560
they smell super bad.

44:55.120 --> 44:56.760
There's a lot of stinky, stinky stuff in there.

44:56.760 --> 44:58.600
Can I just make you some chili?

44:58.600 --> 45:00.420
You want me to make ones with mushrooms

45:00.420 --> 45:02.040
and animal eyes in it?

45:02.040 --> 45:04.040
That one's gonna stink, my man.

45:04.040 --> 45:06.780
That must be the worst, is when a client shows up and says,

45:06.780 --> 45:09.440
I need a love potion and some chili.

45:09.440 --> 45:10.600
And you're like, oh no.

45:10.600 --> 45:12.200
I don't have the pots for that.

45:12.200 --> 45:13.320
I don't have the bandwidth.

45:13.320 --> 45:14.280
Oh boy.

45:15.600 --> 45:17.100
Can you come back tomorrow?

45:18.280 --> 45:20.280
I can't, I wanna love chili right now.

45:20.280 --> 45:21.120
Oh no.

45:21.120 --> 45:26.120
I don't like chili, I don't wanna learn.

45:26.120 --> 45:28.200
I'm usually in charge of going to the supermarket,

45:28.200 --> 45:30.020
but I was sick this week,

45:30.020 --> 45:32.200
and my wife did the shopping instead.

45:32.200 --> 45:33.840
First, it seemed like she just got the usual things

45:33.840 --> 45:34.660
that we always eat,

45:34.660 --> 45:35.920
but when I opened the freezer this morning,

45:35.920 --> 45:37.880
I saw three gigantic tubs of Cool Whip

45:37.880 --> 45:38.920
staring back at me.

45:38.920 --> 45:41.440
My wife has never mentioned her interest in Cool Whip,

45:41.440 --> 45:44.380
and I haven't had this stuff since I was a kid.

45:44.380 --> 45:46.020
What does this mean for my marriage,

45:46.020 --> 45:48.000
and am I cool to dig in while she's at work?

45:48.000 --> 45:50.680
And that's from Cool Whip Cassie.

45:50.680 --> 45:53.960
No, don't just eat Cool Whip.

45:53.960 --> 45:56.920
Oh, what if you need it for something?

45:56.920 --> 45:59.240
Yeah, what if you need Cool Whip?

45:59.240 --> 46:01.340
Come on Griffin, use your head.

46:01.340 --> 46:03.680
You've had that pumpkin pie sitting around for a while,

46:03.680 --> 46:05.480
you've been waiting for an excuse.

46:05.480 --> 46:08.440
Cool Whip can be a fun addition to lots of things.

46:08.440 --> 46:12.680
Strawberry shortcake, maybe a fun peanut butter sandwich.

46:12.680 --> 46:14.040
Add a little Cool Whip on there.

46:14.040 --> 46:15.520
Ooh, interesting.

46:15.520 --> 46:18.240
That's new, add just a little ice cream.

46:18.240 --> 46:20.720
Why are we talking about Cool Whip?

46:20.720 --> 46:23.480
Nobody wants to talk about Cool Whip.

46:23.480 --> 46:25.120
Sorry Cass, hey Cassie, sorry,

46:25.120 --> 46:27.520
but nobody wants to talk about Cool Whip.

46:27.520 --> 46:29.560
Well, it's kind of the question,

46:29.560 --> 46:31.520
so we kind of have to do whatever the question says.

46:31.520 --> 46:34.160
Yeah, but I don't really want to talk about Cool Whip.

46:34.160 --> 46:37.840
Okay, here's the thing to me

46:37.840 --> 46:39.880
that makes this whole situation a little weird,

46:39.880 --> 46:41.440
that it's in the freezer.

46:41.440 --> 46:44.680
Because if you're planning on enjoying the Cool Whip,

46:44.680 --> 46:46.280
it must be defrosted.

46:46.280 --> 46:49.480
No one says, like, what you said just now before

46:49.480 --> 46:51.200
is a situation where you start thinking,

46:51.200 --> 46:53.560
man, I'd love to eat some Cool Whip in four hours.

46:53.560 --> 46:55.080
Oh, I've solved it.

46:55.080 --> 46:57.160
I've cracked this whole thing wide open.

46:57.160 --> 47:02.040
So Cassie's wife doesn't normally do the shopping, right?

47:02.040 --> 47:02.880
Right.

47:02.880 --> 47:04.200
Cassie normally does the shopping.

47:04.200 --> 47:08.600
So wife went, maybe got a little flustered.

47:08.600 --> 47:10.640
There's a great deal on Cool Whip.

47:10.640 --> 47:13.640
They thought maybe Cassie never buys Cool Whip

47:13.640 --> 47:17.400
because it's always expensive, but this is a good deal.

47:17.400 --> 47:19.000
I don't even know if we need Cool Whip,

47:19.000 --> 47:20.840
but we've never had it before.

47:20.840 --> 47:23.600
It's such a good deal, I'm buying three of them.

47:23.600 --> 47:26.360
Cassie hasn't ever mentioned Cool Whip before,

47:26.360 --> 47:29.440
but that could be because of the prohibitive price.

47:29.440 --> 47:33.240
Cassie's worried about getting me excited about Cool Whip

47:33.240 --> 47:36.320
and then not being able to afford it and letting me down.

47:36.320 --> 47:39.680
Well, I'm gonna surprise Cassie with three,

47:39.680 --> 47:42.120
yes, three tubs of Cool Whip.

47:42.120 --> 47:43.920
Well, Cassie, be pleased.

47:43.920 --> 47:46.680
To pitch a different scenario,

47:46.680 --> 47:49.240
you're walking through the grocery store

47:49.240 --> 47:51.840
you've never grocery shopped in your life.

47:51.840 --> 47:56.480
It's a strange labyrinth of products and produce.

47:56.480 --> 47:58.360
Some of this stuff you've never even seen before.

47:58.360 --> 48:00.040
You're lost, you're unmoored.

48:00.040 --> 48:02.640
You're sure you're gonna do a terrible job.

48:02.640 --> 48:05.560
And then you look in a refrigerated section

48:05.560 --> 48:10.040
and you see a product and this product is cool.

48:10.040 --> 48:10.920
Yeah.

48:10.920 --> 48:14.760
You think that's a good place to start.

48:14.760 --> 48:15.800
That's cool.

48:15.800 --> 48:18.000
These are cool, so I'll get these.

48:18.000 --> 48:21.320
If there's something called, if there was great bread,

48:21.320 --> 48:23.760
that's my next destination.

48:23.760 --> 48:26.760
And maybe this is the reward that I do this sometimes.

48:26.760 --> 48:28.400
So I'm like, I'm shopping so good.

48:28.400 --> 48:30.240
I'm buying the healthy items.

48:30.240 --> 48:33.800
I'm gonna buy myself some Sunday cones or whatever.

48:33.800 --> 48:36.800
Something, just a treat for me.

48:36.800 --> 48:39.560
And now three seems excessive, three tubs,

48:39.560 --> 48:42.400
but Cool Whip is a luxury item.

48:42.400 --> 48:44.840
It is rarely necessary.

48:44.840 --> 48:48.160
So maybe Cassidy's wife just thought they were doing

48:48.160 --> 48:49.400
a really great job.

48:51.120 --> 48:55.880
Maybe Cassidy's wife knew that my daughter was coming over

48:55.880 --> 48:59.200
because on Thanksgiving, I had a tub of Cool Whip out

48:59.200 --> 49:00.800
to put on my Ritz tort.

49:00.800 --> 49:05.800
And I had the tray out and I opened the Cool Whip tub

49:06.080 --> 49:08.200
and I looked away to grab a spoon.

49:08.200 --> 49:09.680
And when I looked back, my daughter had shoved

49:09.680 --> 49:11.240
her entire fucking face into it.

49:11.240 --> 49:13.240
Just shoved her face right into the Cool Whip.

49:13.240 --> 49:16.440
I had another tub because I've been down this road before.

49:16.440 --> 49:19.280
I've been down this particular road to perdition.

49:19.280 --> 49:21.080
She thought she had one on me.

49:21.080 --> 49:23.960
And the next time I went to the store, I said,

49:23.960 --> 49:25.800
well, I'm gonna buy two tubs of Cool Whip

49:25.800 --> 49:29.160
because somebody might shove their face into one.

49:29.160 --> 49:30.800
And then she looks at me dead in the eyes and say,

49:30.800 --> 49:33.680
well, somebody shoved their face into two.

49:33.680 --> 49:35.440
Fuck, she got me.

49:35.440 --> 49:37.440
Damn, cold blooded.

49:37.440 --> 49:42.440
So you're suggesting that they bought three suspect ink

49:42.440 --> 49:44.280
that your daughter is going to come to their house.

49:44.280 --> 49:47.440
My daughter is invited to their holiday gatherings.

49:47.440 --> 49:49.280
You can't have enough tubs of Cool Whip

49:49.280 --> 49:51.080
around the house around the holidays, folks.

49:51.080 --> 49:51.920
That's a dessert.

49:51.920 --> 49:53.880
Hey, listen, if a bunch of guests show up,

49:53.880 --> 49:55.960
you don't have a dessert, cut up some fresh fruit,

49:55.960 --> 49:58.520
throw in some Cool Whip, you got a dessert going right there.

49:58.520 --> 50:00.000
Your dessert's done.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.480
You could also just open the tub

50:01.480 --> 50:03.040
and throw some spoons in it.

50:03.040 --> 50:04.840
Now you got a dessert going.

50:04.840 --> 50:07.400
Just have them eat the Cool Whip.

50:07.400 --> 50:08.400
Yeah, man.

50:08.400 --> 50:10.840
Just get out a big thing of cracked pepper

50:10.840 --> 50:13.800
and say, here's a spicy dessert for everyone.

50:13.800 --> 50:15.040
This is fun.

50:15.040 --> 50:17.840
We can all eat things that aren't supposed to be food.

50:18.840 --> 50:21.320
I'm not saying you eat the spoons, Griffin.

50:21.320 --> 50:24.000
Yeah, you just crack open a bunch of Diet Cokes

50:24.000 --> 50:25.360
and pour them in a big bowl.

50:25.360 --> 50:27.160
Hey, everyone, soup's on.

50:30.120 --> 50:32.160
That's actually a good start for a soup.

50:32.160 --> 50:35.280
This has been our podcast, My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

50:35.280 --> 50:36.920
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

50:38.480 --> 50:39.440
We got a couple of things.

50:39.440 --> 50:41.240
The first one I'd like to mention,

50:41.240 --> 50:44.120
this time of year, our incredible listeners

50:44.120 --> 50:48.000
all get together to help fill some empty stockings

50:48.000 --> 50:51.160
here in the Huntington, West Virginia area.

50:51.160 --> 50:53.480
There's a whole list of needs, people that,

50:53.480 --> 50:58.000
not even gifts, there are some for kids on there,

50:58.000 --> 51:00.080
but a lot are just people trying to get clothes

51:00.080 --> 51:01.440
for the cold weather.

51:03.800 --> 51:05.880
Our listeners are always really good about helping,

51:05.880 --> 51:07.080
I mean, literally everybody.

51:07.080 --> 51:08.480
It's amazing every time of year.

51:08.480 --> 51:11.640
It's called MBMBAM Angels.

51:11.640 --> 51:13.440
It's been going on for years now,

51:13.440 --> 51:17.240
and the 2019 drive is in full swing.

51:17.240 --> 51:21.240
If you get a few moments and you have a few bucks to spare,

51:21.240 --> 51:25.400
please head on over to MBMBAMangels.com.

51:25.400 --> 51:30.400
You can claim a family or just send money

51:30.600 --> 51:33.040
to help with the effort.

51:33.040 --> 51:36.800
Huge thanks to all the organizers of that,

51:36.800 --> 51:39.920
and you are the best, and we love you,

51:39.920 --> 51:41.760
and thank you if you can donate.

51:41.760 --> 51:45.160
It would really mean a lot, MBMBAMangels.com.

51:45.160 --> 51:49.960
It looks like they are about halfway there

51:49.960 --> 51:50.800
as I'm reading this.

51:50.800 --> 51:53.440
So if you could pitch in, it would really mean a lot.

51:53.440 --> 51:56.880
Also, big announcement, here in February,

51:56.880 --> 51:58.720
we're gonna be doing a couple of live shows

51:58.720 --> 52:03.240
here in Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, the queen city.

52:03.240 --> 52:04.560
Why Cincinnati, you ask?

52:04.560 --> 52:09.200
Well, it's where I live, and I'll just have had a baby,

52:09.200 --> 52:10.720
and I don't want to go anywhere,

52:10.720 --> 52:11.920
but we're doing some live shows here,

52:11.920 --> 52:15.240
and those tickets are going on sale this Friday.

52:16.520 --> 52:18.440
So be ready for that.

52:18.440 --> 52:21.480
We'll tweet all the links and details and everything.

52:21.480 --> 52:25.280
Also, the Adventure Zone Bureau of Balance game,

52:25.280 --> 52:28.200
the cooperative card storytelling game

52:28.200 --> 52:30.840
that we made with Together Studios,

52:30.840 --> 52:32.360
the presales are open now.

52:32.360 --> 52:34.720
You can go to TheAdventureZoneGame.com

52:34.720 --> 52:36.160

52:41.200 --> 52:43.000
and pre-order the next graphic novel, too.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.120
Why not just do both?

52:45.120 --> 52:47.080
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

52:47.080 --> 52:48.000
for the use of our theme song,

52:48.000 --> 52:50.040
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

52:50.040 --> 52:54.360
Find, just go there, go to wherever you get music,

52:54.360 --> 52:57.560
the music store or the online music store,

52:57.560 --> 52:59.400
and get this music, folks.

52:59.400 --> 53:00.880
And hey, thanks to Maximum Fun

53:00.880 --> 53:02.040
for having us on the network.

53:02.040 --> 53:03.080

53:03.080 --> 53:04.680
Check out all the great shows there.

53:04.680 --> 53:06.960
They have so many, and you're gonna love them.

53:06.960 --> 53:09.280
All of them, I guarantee it.

53:09.280 --> 53:12.600
Send in your Canon Lens questions if you haven't already.

53:12.600 --> 53:15.200
And it's gonna be island-themed, by the way,

53:15.200 --> 53:17.160
so if you wanna dress cordially, feel free.

53:17.160 --> 53:18.640
Wait, really?

53:18.640 --> 53:19.480
Yeah, baby.

53:19.480 --> 53:20.640
Better order a shirt.

53:20.640 --> 53:24.120
I have a box with over 200 beach balls in it

53:24.120 --> 53:25.560
in my home as we speak.

53:25.560 --> 53:27.880
Did we talk about this?

53:27.880 --> 53:30.680
Well, no, I just put my mother-in-law in charge of it,

53:30.680 --> 53:32.800
so it's gonna be buck wild.

53:32.800 --> 53:35.120
This is a woman that once made 30 children into trees

53:35.120 --> 53:36.600
for a Wizard of Oz production.

53:36.600 --> 53:38.960
It's gonna be buck wild, okay?

53:38.960 --> 53:39.800
