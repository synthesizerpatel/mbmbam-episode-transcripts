WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:46.480 --> 00:50.160
Hi everybody, welcome to- Hey Justin, what's wrong?

00:50.160 --> 00:53.280
My brother and my brother and me, whatever. What's the matter?

00:53.280 --> 00:56.720
Vice show or something. I want to look at the calendar.

00:57.680 --> 00:58.160
Yeah? You see-

00:59.200 --> 01:04.000
You see, if you look at the my brother, my brother, and me calendar, you see how, um,

01:04.880 --> 01:09.920
Sunday, February 26th was like, circled, and there's a smiley face. You see,

01:09.920 --> 01:13.520
I put like a bunch of happy face stickers on it and stuff.

01:13.520 --> 01:16.720
Uh-huh. You drew three people sitting on a couch, and they're eating popcorn,

01:16.720 --> 01:18.720
and they're laughing and jesting with each other.

01:18.720 --> 01:27.920
Right. That was us watching the Oscars, and it was great. Billy Crystal was just so funny,

01:27.920 --> 01:30.000
and such a minch.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.640
Billy Crudup was in rare form.

01:32.640 --> 01:34.240
Billy Zane was pretty awesome.

01:34.240 --> 01:34.800
Yeah.

01:34.800 --> 01:38.000
Billy O'Connell was Irish, and Billy D. Williams was there.

01:40.320 --> 01:41.120
I got P.O.D.

01:42.240 --> 01:42.480
Yeah.

01:42.480 --> 01:43.200
Hmm?

01:43.200 --> 01:51.440
Yeah. I got post-Oscar depression. It's a clinical thing. It's a real disorder,

01:51.440 --> 01:55.280
and I'm living with it. I'm not dying from it.

01:55.280 --> 01:55.680
Yeah.

01:55.680 --> 02:02.720
Symptoms include just the sorrow that comes from knowing that you're just not

02:02.720 --> 02:06.000
going to see Billy Crystal again for another, ah, four or five years.

02:07.120 --> 02:08.560
I mean, at best.

02:08.560 --> 02:13.040
Justin, can't you self-medicate by watching the SAG Awards, and the Golden Globes,

02:13.040 --> 02:15.200
and the Grammys, and the Kids' Choice Awards?

02:15.200 --> 02:17.200
And City Slickers, and City Slickers 2.

02:18.720 --> 02:24.560
That's like going to the methadone clinic, though. It's good. It's definitely a way

02:24.560 --> 02:27.040
towards healing, but I don't want to kick this addiction.

02:27.040 --> 02:27.520
Yeah.

02:27.520 --> 02:33.200
I just want to—there are no after-effects. There are no side effects of this addiction

02:33.200 --> 02:39.760
to glamour, this addiction to suspense, the anticipation, the drama, the pomp,

02:39.760 --> 02:41.600
the circumstance, the tradition.

02:41.600 --> 02:42.640
Hmm.

02:42.640 --> 02:47.360
To say nothing of the—the gowns.

02:47.360 --> 02:47.920
Yeah.

02:47.920 --> 02:49.520
You could do what I do, Justin.

02:49.520 --> 02:50.240
What's that?

02:50.240 --> 02:52.320
Live every day like it's a red carpet show.

02:53.280 --> 02:55.120
A red carpet show, you say?

02:55.120 --> 02:57.680
Yes. And as you're walking down the street, just walk up to people and go,

02:57.680 --> 02:58.800
who are you wearing?

02:58.800 --> 02:59.040
Yeah.

02:59.840 --> 03:00.080
Yeah.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.000
I've been arrested a couple times.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.920
Who am I wearing? A smile, because I'm living my life on the red carpet right now.

03:05.920 --> 03:06.480
Yeah.

03:06.480 --> 03:09.520
That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to live my life on the red carpet,

03:09.520 --> 03:12.240
and next year, when the Oscars come on, I'm going to TiVo it,

03:12.240 --> 03:13.520
I'm going to watch it minute a day.

03:13.520 --> 03:22.320
Because the problem is, I use it up all at once. I mainline a whole big chunk of Oscar magic,

03:22.320 --> 03:26.880
when I should be spreading it out as part of my morning prep, morning get-ready ritual.

03:26.880 --> 03:27.600
Slow drip it.

03:28.240 --> 03:30.480
Slow drip it. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

03:30.480 --> 03:32.240
I'm your middle-aged brother, Travis McElroy.

03:32.240 --> 03:36.160
I'm your baby brother, Griffin. Guys, Vegas odds. What are we putting our money on?

03:36.160 --> 03:38.320
Best pick. Best pick.

03:39.600 --> 03:40.720
You mean for 2013?

03:40.720 --> 03:44.480
Best pick for this... Well, yeah, I guess by the time this episode will come out,

03:44.480 --> 03:45.600
we'll have missed it.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.960
I think it was Titanic again.

03:48.080 --> 03:51.440
Yeah, I think Titanic 3D is going to win handily.

03:52.640 --> 03:54.640
If you think about how hard it swept.

03:54.640 --> 04:00.960
Can 3D remakes actually win Oscars? Because if so, that's probably not right.

04:02.560 --> 04:07.280
You just took the movie and you stretched it out, so that it come towards the audience a little bit.

04:07.280 --> 04:11.280
When they have the power to move you, which I think Titanic 3D will do.

04:11.280 --> 04:14.880
Right, but Titanic 2D also had that power. Only now it's like,

04:14.880 --> 04:16.960
well, this ship's coming at me. All right.

04:16.960 --> 04:22.160
But I think because of the economic collapse, it's going to be especially relevant.

04:22.160 --> 04:26.400
I'm saying I have to put their glasses over my glasses, which are already pretty big,

04:26.400 --> 04:28.320
and I'm not sure I want to pay money to do that.

04:31.120 --> 04:33.600
Now, why does that have any bearing on its awards?

04:35.440 --> 04:36.160
You've lost me a little bit.

04:36.160 --> 04:38.160
Movies should be a pleasant experience, right?

04:39.040 --> 04:42.800
The movies that win Oscars, the critics, the academy, the people,

04:43.680 --> 04:47.120
when they walk out of the movie, they say, ugh, right?

04:47.120 --> 04:48.560
They say, oh, man.

04:48.560 --> 04:50.000
Is that a good uh?

04:50.000 --> 04:53.600
Yeah, yeah, they say, or maybe a bad uh, but I think-

04:53.600 --> 04:56.720
That sounded like somebody who had super bad gas.

04:56.720 --> 05:00.880
Yeah, nobody walked out of No Country for Old Men with a fucking spring in their step.

05:00.880 --> 05:03.920
They walked out either confused or kind of lonely.

05:04.960 --> 05:11.280
Yeah, reminded of their eventual ever approaching extermination.

05:12.400 --> 05:17.200
So it can go, I mean, it can go both ways, but you can't get that experience when you have to

05:17.200 --> 05:21.760
put a pair of glasses over your fucking glasses so you look like a dad on vacation.

05:24.880 --> 05:27.680
You know why No Country for Old Men got people so hard?

05:27.680 --> 05:30.960
It's because you hear the author's name and it's Cormac McCarthy.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.920
Boy, does that sound like a cheery guy.

05:34.640 --> 05:35.760
He sounds jovy.

05:35.760 --> 05:41.120
He sounds like maybe a pub owner who gives you a free bacon with your beer.

05:41.680 --> 05:45.600
Like a festive jolly, and it's just not that.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.280
That's not his style at all.

05:47.280 --> 05:50.320
Justin, the name of the movie is No Country for Old Men.

05:50.320 --> 05:50.880
Yeah.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.680
Like there are no words in that title that are pleasant.

05:53.680 --> 05:54.560
Well, then again, it could-

05:54.560 --> 05:57.760
Unless you cut half of them off and put grumpy at the beginning,

05:58.480 --> 06:00.720
and then it's like, oh my, this is very funny.

06:00.720 --> 06:02.080
I guess Travis is an idiot.

06:02.080 --> 06:08.160
Also, No Country for Old Men could be describing like a spring break vacation, right?

06:09.280 --> 06:10.480
This place is not for old men.

06:10.480 --> 06:14.720
No, you're thinking of No Old Men Allowed, which was a much different movie.

06:14.720 --> 06:16.640
I'm starting a young Shia LaBeouf.

06:16.640 --> 06:19.200
I'm thinking of Co-Ed Explosion, Shark Attack.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.160
Who would be in No Old Men Allowed?

06:22.160 --> 06:26.400
It would probably be Shia LaBeouf and in his final performance, Mr. Pat Morita.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.480
I would think would be the cast.

06:29.600 --> 06:33.440
Oh, and like Shia LaBeouf dresses up Pat Morita like a young guy to sneak him in.

06:33.440 --> 06:35.680
Hey kids, I'm here.

06:35.680 --> 06:36.160
Wow.

06:36.160 --> 06:38.080
Surf's up, wax on.

06:38.080 --> 06:38.580
Great.

06:41.840 --> 06:43.600
I've just been dumped.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.760
Do you have any suggestions for getting over an ex?

06:46.480 --> 06:51.360
More importantly, how can I make my ex-boyfriend jealous and or regret leaving me?

06:51.360 --> 06:54.160
That's from dashed lines.

06:54.160 --> 06:58.720
Now I feel like we've answered the first half of this question a lot, recovery sandwich,

06:58.720 --> 07:02.080
but I really want to delve into the second half of this question.

07:02.080 --> 07:06.720
Or how can I make my ex-boyfriend jealous and or regret leaving me?

07:06.720 --> 07:11.360
The problem is you can't do the second thing while also doing the first thing and vice versa.

07:11.360 --> 07:13.280
Wow, that's so true.

07:13.920 --> 07:19.520
Your heart has got to let go of him and you've got to move on to the next man.

07:20.560 --> 07:24.880
You see that report that they just came out from all the scientists that said that love

07:24.880 --> 07:27.760
and hate in your brain is like the same part of your brain.

07:28.320 --> 07:31.680
So when you hate somebody so much because they hurt you, guess what?

07:32.560 --> 07:34.240
You might as well still love them.

07:34.240 --> 07:34.880
Yeah.

07:34.880 --> 07:35.380
Yeah.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.600
And the thing is too, like if you're trying to make him jealous and trying to make him

07:39.600 --> 07:41.840
regret leaving you, you're doing the opposite.

07:43.120 --> 07:43.680
Yeah.

07:43.680 --> 07:44.080
Wait.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.200
And what?

07:45.200 --> 07:46.320
I don't understand.

07:46.320 --> 07:46.640
Hold on.

07:46.640 --> 07:50.480
I would say that if you are actively like, hey, look how happy I am now,

07:50.480 --> 07:54.400
you're confirming in his mind that he made the right choice.

07:54.400 --> 08:01.760
Oh, you're saying that by moving on, you're removing one of your best regret weapons and

08:01.760 --> 08:04.400
that is guilt?

08:04.400 --> 08:05.040
Guilt.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.160
Yeah, exactly.

08:06.160 --> 08:12.000
So you, she needs to hang on to loneliness and just look like super, super lonely all

08:12.000 --> 08:12.400
the time.

08:12.400 --> 08:15.840
That's not, I feel like that's not, that's not what Beyonce would do.

08:16.560 --> 08:17.440
No, no.

08:17.440 --> 08:18.720
What would Beyonce do, Griffin?

08:20.960 --> 08:26.320
Beyonce would just get a new man and the new man would be incredible.

08:27.120 --> 08:27.600
Yeah.

08:27.600 --> 08:33.200
He was at the gym every day and every night he's in front of the stove making up the finest

08:33.200 --> 08:33.600
cuisine.

08:33.600 --> 08:38.240
He's not wearing a shirt and he's hugging her from behind, he's hugging her from behind

08:38.240 --> 08:41.280
and they're standing in a window and the wind is blowing into the room.

08:41.280 --> 08:44.960
Now you have to be careful because if you're looking for a man that's not wearing a shirt,

08:44.960 --> 08:46.160
it could go either way.

08:46.160 --> 08:48.960
That could go one of two ways, but this man, oh boy.

08:48.960 --> 08:51.520
This man is impossible.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.440
It's impossible for a man to be like this.

08:55.440 --> 08:59.040
You've heard of a six pack, he has a 30 pack, it's disgusting.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.880
He has a cube of abs.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.480
It looks like bubble wrap down there.

09:02.480 --> 09:05.040
He's got a microbrewery inside of him.

09:05.040 --> 09:10.880
He's got a whole papst inside of him, but he is all man.

09:13.040 --> 09:15.520
That's the quintessential thing, right?

09:15.520 --> 09:21.600
I guess you could hit him up style, blue can trial style.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.280
You mean steal his credit card and run up a bunch of bills.

09:25.840 --> 09:27.280
I mean petty theft.

09:27.280 --> 09:29.040
Petty theft, right.

09:29.040 --> 09:30.400
Identity theft.

09:30.400 --> 09:33.040
I always wish that song had ended with her getting locked up.

09:33.680 --> 09:37.200
And then having her ramp it off of a cliff Thelma and Louise style.

09:37.200 --> 09:39.120
It'd be quite the caper tune.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.320
There aren't enough caper songs.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.520
I love caper tunes.

09:41.520 --> 09:44.560
They really do seem just like the purview of the Dixie Chicks.

09:47.120 --> 09:51.600
I'm saying that Beyonce has had a much more illustrious career than blue can trial.

09:51.600 --> 09:52.880
So maybe you should take her advice.

09:52.880 --> 09:58.080
Get a man who is just psychedelic to look at.

09:58.080 --> 10:00.480
If Beyonce is so much better than blue can trial,

10:00.480 --> 10:02.400
maybe you can tell me why she named her baby after her.

10:03.120 --> 10:04.000
Oh, man.

10:04.720 --> 10:04.960
Yeah.

10:06.960 --> 10:10.880
Get Beyonce to name her kid after me.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.000
Now you're jealous.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.360
Didn't think I could pull this off.

10:15.360 --> 10:16.960
It took 10 years.

10:16.960 --> 10:17.280
Yeah.

10:18.240 --> 10:19.360
Man, I miss blue can trial.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.520
That's the longest con blue can trial.

10:23.280 --> 10:24.720
That's a pretty good con on her part.

10:24.720 --> 10:27.200
Quite a grift from blue can trial.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.160
You gotta let it go.

10:28.720 --> 10:28.960
Yeah.

10:30.240 --> 10:34.640
Because what I was about to say was that this is what Facebook is for, but it's not.

10:34.640 --> 10:35.680
It shouldn't be.

10:35.680 --> 10:36.000
Yeah.

10:36.000 --> 10:36.400
Oh, no.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.760
You block him.

10:37.760 --> 10:39.200
He can't see your shit anymore.

10:41.040 --> 10:41.680
That's the thing.

10:41.680 --> 10:47.200
I think anything that you do, you're just digging yourself in deeper.

10:47.200 --> 10:49.840
Like you need to let go of this on so many levels.

10:49.840 --> 10:50.640
Like, yeah.

10:50.640 --> 10:53.440
The regret will come just like naturally, I think.

10:53.440 --> 10:53.840
Yeah.

10:53.840 --> 10:55.200
You're great.

10:55.200 --> 10:55.760
You're awesome.

10:55.760 --> 10:57.120
He's going to realize it.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.760
And then he's going to be like, what'd I do?

11:01.280 --> 11:02.320
I did it so wrong.

11:02.320 --> 11:03.360
And then he's going to feel bad.

11:03.360 --> 11:09.440
You've got to make sure your, you know, your Facebook is full of pictures of you

11:09.440 --> 11:12.000
and impossible Dave, the impossibly handsome man.

11:12.560 --> 11:19.440
Just like skiing while like he's reading Bible stories to local orphans.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.280
Just having the time of your lives.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.200
Standing in a window without a shirt, maybe.

11:23.840 --> 11:24.320
Yeah.

11:24.320 --> 11:26.080
Just like the sun's rays.

11:26.080 --> 11:28.160
His muscles rippling in the breeze.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.520
He's ordering your drink at Starbucks.

11:31.520 --> 11:32.160
That's so big.

11:32.160 --> 11:33.440
They don't even put it on the menu.

11:34.080 --> 11:35.440
He knows about the name of it.

11:36.480 --> 11:37.440
And he's the only one.

11:38.560 --> 11:41.040
It's a really special drink and he's sharing it with you.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.840
Let me get a Gordo.

11:44.880 --> 11:48.160
Can I a Gordo, please?

11:48.160 --> 11:54.480
Gordo drip.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.000
Hey, I recently started Griffin.

11:56.000 --> 11:56.560
No, you know what?

11:56.560 --> 11:59.680
I was about to read the next question, but I'm going to do an executive order here until

11:59.680 --> 12:04.240
I'm going to tell you to read me a Yahoo question from the Yahoo Answers service.

12:04.240 --> 12:06.080
I will ratify that.

12:06.960 --> 12:07.360
Okay.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.000
Do you have to do that?

12:08.000 --> 12:08.560
Can I get a second?

12:08.560 --> 12:09.440
Can I get a second?

12:09.440 --> 12:10.080
It's ratified.

12:11.840 --> 12:14.560
This one was sent in by Sarah Rimmer.

12:14.560 --> 12:15.120
Thank you, Sarah.

12:15.120 --> 12:20.640
It's by Yahoo Answers user firerescue343 who asks, I have been drinking.

12:20.640 --> 12:20.960
Help.

12:23.920 --> 12:27.280
This is my first time drinking alcohol ever and I'm drunk.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.400
How do I get sober?

12:28.400 --> 12:29.440
I've tried to sleep.

12:29.440 --> 12:30.400
I can't help.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.200
We've all been there, right?

12:40.400 --> 12:41.120
Have we?

12:41.120 --> 12:46.160
The first time your mind goes to a place that it's never been before?

12:46.160 --> 12:50.240
Yeah, we all need an Apache guide.

12:50.240 --> 12:54.320
I have before been to that place where it's like, well, this is my life from now on.

12:54.320 --> 12:56.160
I'm never going to not be this ever again.

12:56.160 --> 12:57.680
This is just how I'm going to be now.

12:58.960 --> 13:00.480
This is how things are forever.

13:01.120 --> 13:07.680
But once again, I love our modern age because I did not run to the internet.

13:07.680 --> 13:09.520
Tell everyone about it.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.840
That's a pretty good the first time I got drunk story.

13:12.880 --> 13:16.160
First time I got drunk, I got so drunk that I had to ask the internet.

13:17.920 --> 13:21.280
The internet had to guide me out with its trustworthy hand.

13:21.280 --> 13:25.200
And I'm sure the internet was super supportive because that's what you want.

13:25.200 --> 13:30.240
That's what you want is your wingman when you're tripping through the mind fantastic.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.080
Step one, just breathe.

13:32.080 --> 13:33.520
We're going to make it through it OK.

13:33.520 --> 13:39.520
Yeah, you're all you're doing now is exploring the boundaries of your own limits.

13:39.520 --> 13:41.200
I'm here for you, brother.

13:41.200 --> 13:41.840
I'm here.

13:41.840 --> 13:42.560
Just refresh.

13:42.560 --> 13:43.120
I'm here.

13:50.000 --> 13:56.400
I mean, there are people that are like offering extremely helpful but thoroughly scientific

13:57.120 --> 14:01.200
advice like your body will digest roughly one unit of alcohol per hour.

14:01.200 --> 14:05.920
One times four hundred and forty milliliters can of Stella is two point two units.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.720
A whole seven hundred and fifty milliliter bottle of vodka whiskey.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.000
I'm drunk right now.

14:10.000 --> 14:10.880
I'm so drunk.

14:10.880 --> 14:11.680
What does this mean?

14:11.680 --> 14:12.720
What does this mean?

14:12.720 --> 14:13.840
I can't do math.

14:13.840 --> 14:18.560
Get your science out of here and say maybe it's like take your shoes off.

14:18.560 --> 14:22.400
Put your feet on the floor and feel it and then make the spins go away.

14:22.400 --> 14:25.200
Drink a bunch of water and take some ibuprofen.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.320
You maybe do some and then maybe do some math apparently.

14:28.320 --> 14:31.520
Yeah, like long division to figure out how fucked you are.

14:31.520 --> 14:34.080
Answer very because what's your BMI?

14:34.080 --> 14:36.720
OK, first figure out your BMI and then we're going to get through this.

14:36.720 --> 14:43.120
Can you remember the first time that like when you start drinking at the age of 21 legally,

14:43.120 --> 14:49.120
when you start, when you kick that process off, you have no context for how much of this devil

14:49.120 --> 14:51.120
juice you have to put in your body to feel good.

14:51.760 --> 14:57.360
There's and there's a thin, thin needle you have to thread between like, ah, this feels great.

14:57.360 --> 15:01.680
And oh, no, what do I do?

15:01.680 --> 15:03.120
Do you remember the first time?

15:03.120 --> 15:07.760
And by first time, I mean probably the first time you ever drink that you were like, oh,

15:08.320 --> 15:10.320
fuck, I shot the cannon indoors.

15:11.200 --> 15:17.200
Yeah, I can remember being being in a hotel and running around wildly,

15:17.200 --> 15:21.280
trying to just trying to find some sort of semblance of of reality.

15:21.280 --> 15:24.720
Yeah, this was so messed up about the Yahoo Answers question.

15:24.720 --> 15:28.480
Is it I'm 31 years old and sometimes.

15:29.760 --> 15:30.800
I still mess it up.

15:32.160 --> 15:38.160
I'll be at an event I'm uncomfortable with and suddenly I'll realize that I'm trying to impress

15:38.160 --> 15:43.520
the international medicine doctor that Sydney knows while he's telling me stories about visiting

15:43.520 --> 15:44.320
Ecuador.

15:44.320 --> 15:48.160
I'm trying to impress him because once I saw Jungle to Jungle on TV, yes.

15:49.440 --> 15:53.600
The worst part of that moment is you're watching like a slow wave like hit you.

15:53.600 --> 15:56.880
Yeah, at first you're like, oh, fun.

15:56.880 --> 15:57.680
I'm drunk.

15:57.680 --> 16:00.000
And that lasts for about three and a half seconds.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.400
And you're like, oh, I got to deal with this now.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.400
Oh, no, this is my situation right here.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.440
It's a minefield.

16:05.440 --> 16:06.880
No one else is this drunk.

16:06.880 --> 16:07.680
It's just me.

16:08.320 --> 16:13.520
And the one thing I find it impossible to do when I'm in that place and the one thing

16:13.520 --> 16:18.240
that I should do to get through it is I lose that voice that says, you don't need to contribute

16:18.240 --> 16:19.280
this to this conversation.

16:19.280 --> 16:24.480
Just keep your keep a lid on that.

16:24.480 --> 16:25.760
You don't have to let him know.

16:25.760 --> 16:27.760
Yeah, that's that.

16:27.760 --> 16:28.560
Keep that.

16:28.560 --> 16:29.360
Keep your secret.

16:29.360 --> 16:34.160
Wouldn't it be great if you did that one time, you know, like talking to like a foreign ambassador

16:34.160 --> 16:38.240
just like, bro, I'm sorry to interrupt your story about child labor or whatever.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.720
I just got real drunk.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.240
And he was like, it's cool, bro.

16:42.240 --> 16:43.280
We've all been there.

16:43.280 --> 16:45.520
You want me to go get you some water or something?

16:45.520 --> 16:46.400
It's cool, man.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.520
You're going to come down from this.

16:47.520 --> 16:48.240
It's OK.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.640
Mr. President, what happened to Tastations?

16:51.920 --> 16:55.360
What can you use like your legal orders?

16:55.920 --> 17:02.160
I was thinking about you're the president and you could do an executive order to make

17:02.160 --> 17:03.120
Tastations again.

17:04.640 --> 17:05.200
Open up.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.760
It's think of jobs, job growth.

17:09.920 --> 17:10.960
Think of the job growth.

17:14.080 --> 17:15.600
So I heard you used to smoke.

17:15.600 --> 17:24.480
Do you want to dog pound it out of here and just I'm sorry to catch a butt outside and

17:24.480 --> 17:27.440
we'll talk about discontinued hard chocolates.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.520
You're the coolest president ever.

17:32.400 --> 17:33.280
You're really cool.

17:33.280 --> 17:34.160
No, I mean that.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.160
No, seriously, I mean that.

17:36.160 --> 17:40.720
And I think you I think you might be a lamppost.

17:40.720 --> 17:42.000
I think I might be outside.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.680
I might have been outside this whole time.

17:45.680 --> 17:47.040
I might have been outside this whole time.

17:47.040 --> 17:48.320
But listen, you know what?

17:48.320 --> 17:49.600
I want to go to Yahoo Answers.

17:50.160 --> 17:51.760
I love you, President Lamppost.

17:51.760 --> 17:52.720
I got to go.

17:52.720 --> 17:56.080
I got to go see if they can help me because I'm so lost right now.

17:56.080 --> 17:56.640
I want to.

17:56.640 --> 17:57.680
Who is this person?

17:58.240 --> 17:59.120
Who is this person?

17:59.680 --> 18:00.960
I'm going to try drinking.

18:00.960 --> 18:04.240
I know the perfect time and place to do this.

18:04.240 --> 18:05.120
It's a social.

18:05.120 --> 18:07.840
They say you have a problem with alcohol if you start drinking alone.

18:07.840 --> 18:10.880
This person like opened with that.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.240
Yeah.

18:12.240 --> 18:13.440
Where's he got to build to?

18:14.080 --> 18:16.160
Yeah, I'm just going to sit in a room and drink vodka.

18:16.160 --> 18:21.040
I mean, that's not a bad idea because this dude can drape himself in the anonymity of

18:21.040 --> 18:26.160
the internet like a warm, soothing blanket and then ride this out and then understand

18:26.160 --> 18:27.360
how much booze he needs to take.

18:27.360 --> 18:32.080
But if he's at a party, then it's going to be a bad, rough, rough scene.

18:32.960 --> 18:35.680
Griffin, could you do me one favor real quick?

18:35.680 --> 18:36.400
Sure.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.000
Read me his username again.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.200
It's a fire rescue 343.

18:43.200 --> 18:44.320
Oh, no.

18:44.320 --> 18:47.440
Yeah, I hope he wasn't on on fireman call.

18:49.280 --> 18:56.960
This is why it's so important that our nation's 14, 15, 16 year old start drinking because

18:56.960 --> 18:59.840
everyone has that embarrassing college experience.

18:59.840 --> 19:00.720
Or maybe they do.

19:00.720 --> 19:04.880
Maybe not everyone, but many have that embarrassing college experience where they they didn't

19:04.880 --> 19:10.160
know their own limits and they drank too much and they got sloppy.

19:10.160 --> 19:16.640
If we start our kids drinking at 13, 14, 15, they're going to be like Hawkeye Pierce and

19:16.640 --> 19:20.560
BJ sipping martinis and just living life, living it up.

19:20.560 --> 19:25.760
Can we not bring this into our public school system and alongside like sex ed have like

19:25.760 --> 19:30.480
party ed where it's like, listen, if you're at a music festival and somebody offers you

19:30.480 --> 19:35.280
opium, don't do it, but if you do have a buddy, take you to the chill out.

19:35.280 --> 19:39.120
You want to find the most air conditioned bus that is there and go in that.

19:40.080 --> 19:44.640
We had a party ed at our high school, but everyone told me he graduated in 87 and he

19:44.640 --> 19:46.720
was just usually sitting at the bleachers.

19:46.720 --> 19:47.840
That was my party ed.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.320
He's a good man, though, and he was best man at wedding.

19:52.320 --> 19:53.200
I love him very much.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.080
I love you, party ed.

19:54.080 --> 19:54.800
Everything I know.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.400
Thank you, party ed.

19:56.400 --> 19:57.680
Thank you for your tutelage.

19:57.680 --> 20:01.760
Hey, I recently started working on a project with a friend for the project.

20:01.760 --> 20:07.440
My friend was, I'm guessing that that accent is appropriate.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.640
I haven't read the question.

20:08.640 --> 20:13.760
Something felt strange when I was reading his work, so I Google line of what he wrote

20:13.760 --> 20:17.360
only to find out that he had plagiarized it.

20:17.360 --> 20:22.320
When I confronted him, he said that he did not and that I am crazy, even though he is

20:22.320 --> 20:23.280
clearly lying.

20:23.280 --> 20:24.800
This is not a new thing.

20:24.800 --> 20:30.080
He has even come to me with an idea for a podcast where he gives out fake advice.

20:32.080 --> 20:33.120
Now it's personal.

20:33.120 --> 20:33.920
Help me, brothers.

20:33.920 --> 20:38.960
Do I take the project for my own or should I just cancel the project altogether?

20:38.960 --> 20:42.320
That is from Zucked in Zuckersburg.

20:42.320 --> 20:42.960
That's great.

20:44.240 --> 20:45.200
Oh, man.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.560
He did get Zucked.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.600
It sounds like we're about to get fucking Zucked.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.320
We need to shut this kid down.

20:52.320 --> 20:57.520
Okay, listen, you no account motherfucker, you're dead.

20:57.520 --> 20:58.880
You're dead and you don't even know it.

20:58.880 --> 21:03.760
You're walking around talking, eating liquor made, and you don't even know you're dead.

21:03.760 --> 21:04.800
You are dead.

21:04.800 --> 21:08.640
We know lawyers and we know desperate, desperate people.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.520
People that would do anything for liquor made.

21:11.520 --> 21:15.040
They love liquor made and we know where to get it.

21:15.040 --> 21:18.640
The only place you can get it is this one shitty gas station in Chilla Coffee.

21:18.640 --> 21:21.680
And we're not going to tell anyone which shitty gas station in Chilla Coffee.

21:21.680 --> 21:28.400
No, we're not telling anybody that we have a currency and it's liquor made and we can get anything we want.

21:28.400 --> 21:29.040
Okay?

21:29.040 --> 21:33.520
So you better back off and come up with another podcast idea or steal somebody else's.

21:33.520 --> 21:44.560
Maybe two friends chat about the events of the day or a bespectacled man judges people.

21:44.560 --> 21:45.200
I love it.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.480
Fairly or unfairly.

21:46.480 --> 21:48.080
Maybe that's an idea you could do.

21:48.080 --> 21:52.160
Two Canadians and a comedian friend yuck it up.

21:53.280 --> 21:53.520
Right.

21:54.160 --> 21:57.600
That's the new tagline that I've come up for, for stop podcasting yourself.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.800
Oh, and call it start podcasting yourself.

22:00.800 --> 22:01.040
Yeah.

22:01.840 --> 22:06.480
Yeah, that's alphabetically you've trumped them, which is, as we all know-

22:06.480 --> 22:08.720
Commence podcasting yourself.

22:08.720 --> 22:11.280
Start podcasting a time.

22:12.880 --> 22:14.160
Time to podcast.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.320
Just bring it back, Captain Kangaroo.

22:16.320 --> 22:19.120
He's not making his TV show new, what are you making into a podcast?

22:19.120 --> 22:21.040
Yeah, don't steal anything but our show.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.320
This is all we got.

22:22.320 --> 22:23.040
Don't steal.

22:23.840 --> 22:24.400
Remake.

22:24.400 --> 22:24.640
Yeah.

22:25.200 --> 22:29.040
Remake, reboot, refresh the franchise.

22:29.040 --> 22:29.840
Do you know what I mean?

22:29.840 --> 22:30.640
Oh my God.

22:30.640 --> 22:37.120
What if this kid remixed, refreshed, rebooted My Brother, My Brother, and Me?

22:37.120 --> 22:38.640
With Captain Kangaroo.

22:38.640 --> 22:40.400
The My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.200
The sequel.

22:41.200 --> 22:41.760
It's new.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.600
It's got Vanderbeek.

22:43.600 --> 22:46.480
It's got Tony Maguire.

22:46.480 --> 22:49.600
You just gotta call like the ultimate My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

22:49.600 --> 22:50.160
Right.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.240
My Brother, My Brother, and Me babies.

22:52.240 --> 22:53.040
Ultimate universe.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.280
Ultimate universe two.

22:55.280 --> 22:56.080
2022.

22:57.680 --> 23:00.880
My Brother, My Brother, and Me 2099 babies.

23:01.520 --> 23:02.720
Baby YZs.

23:03.280 --> 23:03.920
Rebirth.

23:03.920 --> 23:04.400
Rebirth.

23:04.960 --> 23:05.520
Exodus.

23:08.000 --> 23:08.880
Holiday special.

23:08.880 --> 23:13.440
Uh, so there are plenty of other ideas for podcasts out there.

23:13.440 --> 23:17.280
And honestly, aren't podcasts more important than whatever this dumbass project you're

23:17.280 --> 23:18.560
working on for school is?

23:18.560 --> 23:20.880
Listen, none of us are going to high school anymore.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.640
We all dropped out to make podcasts.

23:22.640 --> 23:23.360
Yeah.

23:23.360 --> 23:27.600
And if you can get a pretty good idea, everyone, I'd drop this project altogether.

23:27.600 --> 23:29.520
Yeah, but not when you stole from someone else.

23:30.640 --> 23:32.880
Or not when you stole specifically from us.

23:32.880 --> 23:33.200
Yeah.

23:33.200 --> 23:34.400
And you know what?

23:34.400 --> 23:36.800
I just realized reading back over this question.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.960
The project I don't think is for school.

23:39.680 --> 23:42.480
Like, this is just a fun project they're doing together, right?

23:43.360 --> 23:44.000
This is-

23:44.000 --> 23:48.880
Can you pick a more abstract word to describe the thing you're doing?

23:50.240 --> 23:51.680
A project.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.200
Yeah, we're building a soapbox.

23:54.720 --> 23:58.160
But I'm just wondering, like, who's like, hey, let's do a fun thing together.

23:58.160 --> 24:00.560
Okay, let me go plagiarize some stuff.

24:00.560 --> 24:00.800
Sure.

24:01.600 --> 24:02.320
It just seems-

24:03.360 --> 24:04.720
Sometimes you get overwhelmed.

24:04.720 --> 24:11.840
Your friend, Zucked, in Zuckerberg, has great taste in podcasts and he's got a lot of great ideas.

24:11.840 --> 24:14.240
And you think, I wish I had some of his ideas.

24:14.240 --> 24:16.240
And then you get somebody else's ideas.

24:16.240 --> 24:17.680
But there are fucking ideas.

24:18.800 --> 24:19.040
Yeah.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.960
Please, please stop stealing our ideas.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.800
You're standing on the shoulders of giants.

24:22.800 --> 24:23.680
And we're the giants.

24:23.680 --> 24:24.800
Do you know what plagiarism-

24:24.800 --> 24:25.920
Get off of our shoulders.

24:25.920 --> 24:26.880
We're little giants.

24:26.880 --> 24:28.080
We can't take the pressure.

24:28.720 --> 24:30.480
We just plagiarized little giants.

24:30.480 --> 24:31.200
Just by mentioning it.

24:31.200 --> 24:31.700
Dammit.

24:32.480 --> 24:34.240
But he forced us into it.

24:34.240 --> 24:38.800
I feel real pressured now to come up with a new idea for a podcast as this guy's moving in.

24:38.800 --> 24:41.120
And the little giants fan cast is it.

24:42.240 --> 24:42.960
That's right.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.320
Little, little giants.

24:44.320 --> 24:45.440
My fan cast.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.200
Little giants, where are they now?

24:47.200 --> 24:51.840
They might be little giants, a fan cast about little giants.

24:51.840 --> 24:54.560
The movie that nobody saw but the three people who are currently speaking.

24:55.200 --> 24:56.960
So hope you like the goofs, everyone.

24:56.960 --> 24:57.440
Good night.

24:57.440 --> 25:05.200
Okay, if you were to make a kid's sports podcast that is about, it could be about angels in the

25:05.200 --> 25:10.880
outfield, little giants, little big league, little big league, rookie of the year, big green-

25:10.880 --> 25:12.320
Guts, guts, global guts.

25:13.120 --> 25:16.960
Guts, global guts, Bad News Bears and Bad News Bears remake.

25:16.960 --> 25:17.440
Yeah.

25:17.440 --> 25:21.440
What was that one with Keanu Reeves where he taught all the inner city kids a thing or two

25:21.440 --> 25:22.240
about baseball?

25:23.200 --> 25:24.240
Ladybugs.

25:24.240 --> 25:26.400
No, it was called a thing or two about baseball.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.360
A thing or two about baseball.

25:29.200 --> 25:30.640
Ladybugs would be good.

25:31.840 --> 25:32.480
Heavyweights.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.280
Heavyweights, sure, yeah.

25:35.840 --> 25:37.760
There's go-kart racing in that against the-

25:37.760 --> 25:39.360
Dropping LBs is the ultimate sport.

25:39.360 --> 25:43.440
Torturing Ben Stiller is the most rewarding game.

25:44.240 --> 25:45.680
I think that'll be a pretty good podcast.

25:45.680 --> 25:46.720
Why don't you make that one?

25:46.720 --> 25:48.080
Yeah, here, that one's yours.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.360
We just wrapped a little ribbon around it.

25:49.360 --> 25:51.600
Go fucking take it, but don't take ours.

25:52.720 --> 25:53.120
Take it.

25:53.120 --> 25:58.240
Or I'll plagiarize somebody who murdered someone sometime to your friend.

25:58.240 --> 26:02.320
I'll show them, I'll rip off their style, but I'll do it on your friend, the murder.

26:03.840 --> 26:05.680
Can you go over this for me one more time?

26:05.680 --> 26:06.320
Yeah, I'm trying.

26:06.880 --> 26:08.880
John Wayne Gacy, he was a murderer, right?

26:09.520 --> 26:10.480
He murdered kids, though.

26:11.040 --> 26:12.160
Who didn't murder kids?

26:12.160 --> 26:13.840
Who was just an all-around murderer?

26:14.480 --> 26:15.120
Jack the Ripper.

26:16.160 --> 26:18.240
Jack the Ripper murdered women.

26:18.240 --> 26:23.120
I'm gonna steal his style of murder, and I'll kill your fucking friend.

26:25.120 --> 26:27.600
Okay, let's cut out all the jibba-jabba.

26:27.600 --> 26:28.880
You're gonna murder somebody.

26:29.600 --> 26:31.280
You're just talking around in circles.

26:31.280 --> 26:35.680
I'm not gonna guarantee murder this guy, but if a show called

26:35.680 --> 26:41.360
Three Siblings and One, I'll fucking kill him.

26:41.360 --> 26:42.000
He's dead.

26:42.560 --> 26:43.360
He's dead.

26:43.360 --> 26:44.320
He doesn't even know it.

26:44.320 --> 26:44.880
He's dead.

26:44.880 --> 26:50.480
So, uh, you do whatever you want with your project, because it might not be a problem anymore,

26:50.480 --> 26:52.320
because it sounds like we're gonna have to kill your friend.

26:52.320 --> 26:52.800
Yeah.

26:52.800 --> 26:53.280
Sorry.

26:53.280 --> 26:56.720
Sorry you wrote in, and this blood is on your hand.

26:56.720 --> 26:57.680
You'll hear from our lawyers.

26:59.200 --> 26:59.760
Our dead.

26:59.760 --> 27:01.360
Our, if they don't kill them first.

27:01.360 --> 27:02.880
Our lawyers are ghosts.

27:04.880 --> 27:07.040
Everyone we know is a ghost or a horse.

27:07.040 --> 27:07.760
That's sort of our thing.

27:07.760 --> 27:08.240
Griffin?

27:08.240 --> 27:08.720
Yep.

27:08.720 --> 27:09.520
That's sort of the theme.

27:09.520 --> 27:12.720
Can you read me a Yahoo answer, please?

27:12.720 --> 27:13.680
Sure, sure, sure.

27:13.680 --> 27:15.280
Sure, sure, sure.

27:15.280 --> 27:16.240
This'll flow nicely.

27:16.240 --> 27:17.600
This is sent in by Emily Wall.

27:18.160 --> 27:18.720
Thank you, Emily.

27:18.720 --> 27:23.760
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Nom, who asks, demon hunter, help me.

27:25.600 --> 27:26.000
Wait.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.520
I want to be a demon hunter.

27:27.520 --> 27:28.720
I beg you guys.

27:28.720 --> 27:30.480
Real demon hunters out there?

27:30.480 --> 27:31.280
Knock, knock.

27:31.280 --> 27:32.000
Answer me.

27:32.000 --> 27:32.880
Teach me.

27:32.880 --> 27:35.280
I want to be a demon hunter and the best.

27:35.920 --> 27:36.960
Please answer me.

27:36.960 --> 27:41.040
I only want answers from the real ones, not the wannabes or the nonbelievers.

27:41.040 --> 27:43.920
There's nothing worse than wannabe demon hunters.

27:43.920 --> 27:44.480
Yeah.

27:44.480 --> 27:45.760
I'm trying to-

27:45.760 --> 27:48.000
They bought all their demon hunting gear from L.L. Bean.

27:51.760 --> 27:55.840
I'm trying to make a circle of salt to capture a fey and it's like, whoa, what'd I trip over?

27:55.840 --> 27:56.960
Like, get out of here.

27:58.240 --> 28:00.960
You, you wannabe demon hunter.

28:00.960 --> 28:03.200
Some of us are trying to track down the Balrog.

28:07.040 --> 28:07.440
Buddy.

28:08.080 --> 28:08.480
Buddy.

28:08.480 --> 28:13.360
That guy wouldn't know a werewolf from a wolf man.

28:14.480 --> 28:19.600
Do you think in the world of demon hunters, like the lowest tier are like the Sasquatch hunters?

28:20.640 --> 28:20.960
Yeah.

28:20.960 --> 28:23.120
They're just wandering around in circles and looking.

28:23.120 --> 28:30.800
I am convinced that Sasquatch hunters are just looking for a cover to have gay sex in the woods.

28:32.800 --> 28:35.440
They do keep saying the word squash a lot.

28:35.440 --> 28:36.640
They say squash a lot.

28:36.640 --> 28:37.600
That's clue one.

28:37.600 --> 28:39.360
Clue two, it's just two guys.

28:39.360 --> 28:44.640
Like in any other culture, the fact that two guys in a tent go to the woods,

28:44.640 --> 28:49.200
stay for some unspecified amount of time and come back with nothing.

28:49.200 --> 28:55.280
They are having secret gay sex with each other that they're hiding from their wives.

28:55.280 --> 29:01.040
Because the alternative is that they're looking for a shit that does not exist in the real world.

29:01.040 --> 29:06.800
I sooner understand fishing and that's just hurting fish for no reason.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.880
That's just being mean to fish.

29:08.880 --> 29:13.440
That's just being mean to fish, which after seeing that movie about Nemo,

29:13.440 --> 29:14.800
I don't see how anybody could do that.

29:14.800 --> 29:19.840
You're stretching this out to encompass basically all folklore.

29:19.840 --> 29:25.680
So across the globe, like Chupacabra, Loch Ness Monster,

29:25.680 --> 29:29.200
these are just different reasons for different countries

29:29.200 --> 29:31.760
and different cultures to have secret gay sex.

29:31.760 --> 29:37.840
Loch Ness Monster, two Scottish gay guys wanted to have sex by a lake.

29:37.840 --> 29:41.840
Area 51, a bunch of people in Nevada got together in the desert.

29:42.640 --> 29:43.920
For dusty sex.

29:43.920 --> 29:46.240
Dusty bone circle is what they did.

29:46.880 --> 29:48.720
And then they came back like, yeah, we found a bunker.

29:48.720 --> 29:49.200
It was great.

29:50.320 --> 29:54.880
Great, we can't ever find it again, but it's no big deal.

29:56.240 --> 29:57.760
What other mythological beasts?

29:57.760 --> 29:58.560
I'm trying to-

29:58.560 --> 29:59.440
Spring-heeled Jack.

29:59.440 --> 30:03.360
Spring-heeled Jack, is that Jack the Ripper?

30:04.240 --> 30:04.720
I don't know.

30:05.280 --> 30:06.400
He was quite real.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
What about Champion, Lake Champlain?

30:10.880 --> 30:11.920
What is that?

30:11.920 --> 30:14.080
That's like America's Loch Ness Monster.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.720
Okay, well, do you remember what I was talking about?

30:16.720 --> 30:18.640
No, I think that's real.

30:18.640 --> 30:19.440
That one is actually real.

30:19.440 --> 30:20.160
That one's true.

30:20.880 --> 30:23.280
Jersey Devil, real.

30:23.280 --> 30:23.840
Mothman.

30:23.840 --> 30:33.680
Two older gentlemen from the Point Pleasant area who wanted to have gay sex under a bridge.

30:33.680 --> 30:34.480
I see.

30:34.480 --> 30:38.480
Jackalope even sounds, Jackalope sounds like some sort of gay sex.

30:38.480 --> 30:40.640
That one's not even a clever disguise.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.640
That's when two guys named Jack eloped together.

30:44.640 --> 30:44.880
Yeah.

30:45.680 --> 30:51.120
Yeah, that's, wow, that's a little on the, what I'm saying is basically

30:51.120 --> 30:55.760
the entire cryptozoology field.

30:55.760 --> 30:56.480
Dinosaurs.

30:57.760 --> 31:02.080
Dinosaurs, obviously cavemen wanting to have gay sex with each other.

31:02.080 --> 31:03.840
Oh, that's a huge conspiracy.

31:03.840 --> 31:06.000
A lot of bucks went into forging that one.

31:06.000 --> 31:11.200
That one must be for like, I don't know, rich museum owners to have gay sex with each other.

31:12.000 --> 31:18.320
My name is Stephen J. Smithsonian and I'd like to have secret gay sex with another man.

31:18.320 --> 31:21.200
I know dinosaurs.

31:21.200 --> 31:24.800
Welcome to Jurassic Secret Gay Sex Dungeon.

31:25.440 --> 31:27.440
Welcome to Jurassic Pork.

31:28.560 --> 31:29.600
Fuck, you're so sweaty.

31:31.840 --> 31:32.800
Oh, man.

31:32.800 --> 31:36.240
Hey, Deb, I'm gonna be back next weekend.

31:36.960 --> 31:40.560
I'm just gonna go out, look for some mega fauna with Gary.

31:41.520 --> 31:42.320
I'll come back.

31:42.320 --> 31:49.040
Hopefully nothing hurts me out there in the wild.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.720
Uh, that's not real.

31:51.360 --> 31:55.120
That's not a real thing you're going out looking for and everybody knows it.

31:55.120 --> 31:57.040
Dude, I don't think everybody knows it, Justin.

31:57.040 --> 32:03.280
I think that there are some groups of people that have gone out there looking for el chupacabra

32:04.000 --> 32:08.800
and what they have found instead is, hey, I had such a fun time looking for chupacabra.

32:09.360 --> 32:10.400
Let's, let's.

32:10.400 --> 32:17.680
How much would you hate to be the rookie sasquatch hunter that's really in it to find the sasquatch

32:17.680 --> 32:19.440
and you're really passionate about it?

32:19.440 --> 32:20.720
True believer.

32:20.720 --> 32:24.800
And like you roll up and like you find a group of guys like, yeah, we're sasquatch hunters

32:24.800 --> 32:28.320
and like they're all winking at each other and like, oh, they know where the sasquatch is.

32:28.320 --> 32:30.480
I'm going with those guys and then you get out there.

32:30.480 --> 32:34.640
The fucking witching hour rolls around and it's, it's dicks out, everyone.

32:35.360 --> 32:36.080
Everyone dicks.

32:36.080 --> 32:36.880
Dicks ahoy.

32:37.440 --> 32:38.880
Dennis, I'm butting your pants.

32:38.880 --> 32:41.280
We're going to find a sasquatch.

32:41.280 --> 32:43.840
Come here, you big, you big fire monster.

32:45.040 --> 32:47.040
You know what they say about big feet.

32:47.040 --> 32:47.680
What's up?

32:48.320 --> 32:49.200
Sasquatch.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.320
Squatchin' it.

32:50.320 --> 32:51.360
Let's squatch together.

32:51.360 --> 32:56.080
That's why they call secret gay sex sasquatch.

32:57.600 --> 32:58.960
But this is interesting.

32:58.960 --> 33:00.560
This only applies to men.

33:00.560 --> 33:04.240
If women want to have secret gay sex with each other, they just do it because they're grownups.

33:05.840 --> 33:07.040
They do it like adults.

33:07.040 --> 33:13.920
They don't hide in the forest and pretend to be looking for the, uh, the globster or goat man.

33:14.560 --> 33:15.520
Hoedog.

33:15.520 --> 33:16.880
What's a, what's a globster?

33:18.080 --> 33:18.720
Oh, sorry.

33:18.720 --> 33:19.200
Say again.

33:19.200 --> 33:19.920
A globster.

33:19.920 --> 33:20.640
Globster.

33:20.640 --> 33:22.640
A globster is a b- a blob.

33:23.440 --> 33:25.920
A glob that's also a lobster, obviously.

33:25.920 --> 33:28.640
It's, it's a blob from New Zealand.

33:30.880 --> 33:33.360
Yeah, it's pretty, it's pretty brutal.

33:33.360 --> 33:38.080
But listen, guys, just admit you love each other and live your lives.

33:38.640 --> 33:41.280
And stop go- just leave Sasquatch alone.

33:41.280 --> 33:41.840
Uh, yeah.

33:41.840 --> 33:43.680
He's got, he's got better things to do.

33:43.680 --> 33:51.440
He's got better things to do to avoid the, the clumsy advances of a bunch of closeted homosexual men.

33:51.440 --> 33:57.760
I'm, uh, I'm looking back at the Yahoo page and I just want to share a couple of responses.

33:57.760 --> 34:06.000
One was by Yahoo Answers user Mastema, whose, uh, image is, I would say, uh, an absolutely terrifying

34:06.000 --> 34:11.280
pale white face with murderous red lips and, uh, a long black hair.

34:11.840 --> 34:14.080
Uh, and he says, stop hunting.

34:14.080 --> 34:15.360
I came to you.

34:15.360 --> 34:16.080
Kill me.

34:17.200 --> 34:17.700
Whaaat?

34:18.800 --> 34:23.840
And then, uh, right below him is WickedVamp whose profile, I would say, fits the exact

34:23.840 --> 34:28.400
description I just gave you, uh, who says, pulls up a chair.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.440
Okay, demon hunter, let's see you do your thing.

34:31.440 --> 34:34.400
Mastema, looks like we know what's for dinner tonight.

34:35.440 --> 34:35.940
Oops!

34:37.680 --> 34:38.240
Whoopsies!

34:38.240 --> 34:41.600
And then the third one that says, guys, this is your dad.

34:41.600 --> 34:42.480
Get off the computer.

34:42.480 --> 34:42.800
Whoops!

34:42.800 --> 34:43.920
Calm down to dinner.

34:43.920 --> 34:47.600
Aw, man, looks like you accidentally role-played on Yahoo Answers.

34:50.240 --> 34:51.440
That was the thing you did there.

34:51.440 --> 34:51.940
Oops!

34:51.940 --> 34:52.980
Oops!

34:52.980 --> 34:57.140
I'm waiting for a call from work and I can't get it while you guys are on the modem.

34:57.140 --> 34:59.220
Please log, please log off.

35:01.220 --> 35:04.740
Oh, oh, god damn.

35:06.340 --> 35:09.700
People, people, demon, demon hunters.

35:09.700 --> 35:13.700
Are there more answers about demon hunters?

35:13.700 --> 35:16.500
The thread, the thread there just stopped.

35:16.500 --> 35:19.700
I mean, there's somebody else who says, you Twittered soul.

35:19.700 --> 35:21.460
Why would you like to become a hunter?

35:21.460 --> 35:23.060
You not join us.

35:23.700 --> 35:26.020
So I think they were also going for I'm a demon.

35:29.620 --> 35:30.980
No, let's be honest.

35:30.980 --> 35:33.220
Demons would not be good at typing.

35:33.220 --> 35:36.500
No, because they have like three fingers and it's like all claws.

35:36.500 --> 35:38.260
Yeah, it's all claws and prongs down there.

35:39.620 --> 35:44.100
What if the best place, would you be shocked to find that the best ways to find demons is

35:44.100 --> 35:45.300
on Yahoo Answers?

35:45.300 --> 35:46.340
I would be shocked.

35:46.340 --> 35:48.500
Like if that turned out like they've all been there.

35:48.500 --> 35:52.580
I would be shocked if the best place to find them was literally anywhere else.

35:53.620 --> 35:55.060
I think this is a breeding ground.

35:55.060 --> 35:58.980
I think that Yahoo Answers web servers are built on a fucking hell mouth.

36:00.980 --> 36:04.500
This sounds like, this sounds like the spinoff series that Blake Lively is going to do.

36:05.140 --> 36:08.900
I used to be just a normal average girl to one day on Yahoo Answers.

36:08.900 --> 36:12.180
I found demons and now I hunt them because I'm half demon.

36:13.700 --> 36:14.900
And also we got canceled.

36:14.900 --> 36:19.140
Sorry dad, I messed up.

36:20.340 --> 36:21.300
Hey Griffin.

36:21.300 --> 36:21.620
What?

36:22.340 --> 36:23.940
You know where I go looking for demons?

36:24.740 --> 36:24.980
Where do you go?

36:24.980 --> 36:25.940
My impersonal demons?

36:25.940 --> 36:26.420
Where do you go?

36:27.940 --> 36:28.660
Money.

36:28.660 --> 36:30.580
That's, that's my, that's my demon.

36:30.580 --> 36:31.540
That's the monkey on my back.

36:31.540 --> 36:32.180
That's your vice?

36:32.900 --> 36:35.860
That's my vice is the pursuit of the green stuff.

36:35.860 --> 36:37.460
The old green bats, sawbucks.

36:38.500 --> 36:39.700
And there's only one cure for that.

36:39.700 --> 36:41.780
Presidential flashcards!

36:41.780 --> 36:43.540
Presidential flashcards, baby.

36:43.540 --> 36:45.540
Deb Prezos.

36:45.540 --> 36:46.580
Yum yum, give me some.

36:59.300 --> 37:03.460
Today we're getting taken to the money zone by Apple and Kiwi Comics.

37:04.660 --> 37:07.300
According to the information that has been provided to me,

37:07.300 --> 37:16.020
it is the story of a moderately insane adventure with his lazier and less insane adventure friend.

37:16.020 --> 37:19.780
And they live together in a, they live fairly average city lives,

37:19.780 --> 37:24.100
not including the nightmarish creatures, the kidnappings, and journeys to strange places.

37:24.100 --> 37:26.820
Also, their dog is a cactus.

37:26.820 --> 37:29.140
You left out the fact that one's black and one's white.

37:30.020 --> 37:30.580
Because I-

37:30.580 --> 37:31.700
You won't guess which one.

37:31.700 --> 37:35.700
They said, they said that in the email to us to say to everyone else.

37:35.700 --> 37:42.100
Because it's one's moderately insane black adventurer and his lazier and less insane white adventurer.

37:42.100 --> 37:50.100
Right, I don't, I didn't understand specifically what role race played in Apple and Kiwi Comics.

37:50.100 --> 37:54.900
I assumed it's like in Final Fantasy you have like the the white mage and the black mage.

37:54.900 --> 37:57.940
One's a black adventurer, one's a white adventurer.

37:57.940 --> 37:58.900
That's good, Travis.

37:58.900 --> 38:03.460
Oh, one follows the forces of chaos, the other the forces of peace.

38:03.460 --> 38:04.100
I like that.

38:04.100 --> 38:07.300
Hold on, because we might be getting racist again.

38:08.340 --> 38:08.660
Okay.

38:09.700 --> 38:11.620
No, no, no, that's not what I mean.

38:11.620 --> 38:12.580
I just mean-

38:12.580 --> 38:14.420
You mean that one is unruly.

38:16.340 --> 38:16.820
One is-

38:16.820 --> 38:17.460
I mean that-

38:17.460 --> 38:19.700
Would you say savage, Justin?

38:19.700 --> 38:21.780
White is good and black is bad.

38:21.780 --> 38:22.660
I don't see-

38:22.660 --> 38:23.620
What's the pro-

38:23.620 --> 38:24.580
Oh no!

38:24.580 --> 38:26.660
What problem in my head?

38:26.660 --> 38:28.340
So Apple and Kiwi Comics.

38:29.940 --> 38:32.900
AppleandKiwiComics.com.

38:32.900 --> 38:34.900
Check it out.

38:34.900 --> 38:35.540
Check it out.

38:37.380 --> 38:38.100
And if you need-

38:38.740 --> 38:41.620
If you need to wash away the dirt of our racism.

38:41.620 --> 38:45.780
Need to wash away the dirt of accidentally thinking you might have sounded racist on

38:45.780 --> 38:48.660
your comedy podcast, boy have I got a soap for you.

38:50.260 --> 38:52.980
It's stack soap and it's soap that stacks.

38:54.260 --> 38:56.420
I know what you're saying, witchcraft.

38:56.420 --> 38:56.900
Illegal.

38:57.780 --> 38:58.340
Uh, no.

38:58.340 --> 38:59.140
Black magic.

38:59.940 --> 39:00.900
Black magic, fuck!

39:00.900 --> 39:02.100
Fuck!

39:02.100 --> 39:04.660
You need some white soap to clean up your black magic.

39:04.660 --> 39:05.380
Oh fuck!

39:06.180 --> 39:07.220
God damn it!

39:07.220 --> 39:07.460
Shit!

39:08.020 --> 39:08.340
Shit!

39:12.660 --> 39:13.780
Okay, I'm gonna try again.

39:15.620 --> 39:20.580
Soap that goes into another soap is stack soap.

39:20.580 --> 39:22.420
The soap squashes together.

39:22.420 --> 39:29.380
When you've used up one bar of soap till you just have a sliver, a stupid sliver,

39:29.380 --> 39:36.900
there's a crevasse in the next bar of stack soap that is specifically made so that your

39:36.900 --> 39:42.180
sliver can go inside the new bar.

39:42.180 --> 39:44.900
So you will never miss out on using soap again.

39:46.420 --> 39:50.900
How does this interface with the shampoo suds that I use as soap?

39:52.660 --> 39:56.420
It is going to completely negate your need for them because you'll finally have real

39:56.420 --> 39:58.260
soap like a real boy.

39:58.260 --> 40:02.100
Travis, you used stack soap while visiting me this weekend.

40:02.100 --> 40:02.900
What'd you think?

40:02.900 --> 40:08.580
I was surprised to find it did not dry out my skin and it left me feeling cleaner than

40:08.580 --> 40:10.500
I believe I've ever felt before in my life.

40:11.780 --> 40:12.420
Wonderful.

40:12.420 --> 40:13.700
That's a god's honest.

40:14.420 --> 40:19.300
Stack Soap's looking for your contributions to help get them off the ground.

40:19.300 --> 40:21.380
You can go to stacksoap.com.

40:21.380 --> 40:28.820
They've already met their fundraising goal, but they're still taking donations and you

40:28.820 --> 40:35.220
can still get a lot of great soap for a pretty darn good price as you help a burgeoning young

40:35.220 --> 40:36.420
business find its footing.

40:36.420 --> 40:38.100
So go to stacksoap.com.

40:39.060 --> 40:45.380
Griffin, I believe you have a song about apple and kiwi that you have prepared that makes

40:45.380 --> 40:47.300
no mention to skin color.

40:47.300 --> 40:48.420
Can you swing that for me?

40:48.420 --> 40:53.780
Yeah, this is going to be a tricky wicket.

40:53.780 --> 41:00.500
I was going to do a goof, like I downloaded a fart piano app on my phone, but now the

41:00.500 --> 41:02.580
waters are choppy enough as is.

41:02.580 --> 41:04.420
Oh, I think I should really give this one.

41:04.980 --> 41:05.220
Okay.

41:09.620 --> 41:16.980
Whether you're black or white or wrong or right, not that black people are wrong and

41:16.980 --> 41:24.260
white people are right all the time, you got to go on adventures with your ethically diverse

41:24.260 --> 41:25.060
friends.

41:25.060 --> 41:32.420
That's the best kind of adventure you can have at appleandkiwicomics.com.

41:34.580 --> 41:34.820
No.

41:34.820 --> 41:36.020
Appleandkiwicomics.com.

41:36.020 --> 41:36.740
Was that racist?

41:36.740 --> 41:37.780
Was the song racist?

41:38.340 --> 41:39.300
No, not at all.

41:39.300 --> 41:40.980
I said that black people were wrong.

41:43.300 --> 41:44.180
You said not that they were wrong.

41:44.180 --> 41:45.540
It was a couplet.

41:45.540 --> 41:47.060
It was obviously a couplet.

41:47.780 --> 41:53.060
That's the listener introducing his own racist parallelism into your song that's just about

41:53.060 --> 41:54.820
friends and adventure.

41:55.620 --> 41:56.260
And race.

41:56.900 --> 41:57.460
And race.

42:00.180 --> 42:02.420
You've been working on a stack soap song.

42:02.420 --> 42:06.500
Yeah, I've been thinking about doing a right in the middle, like right after the first

42:06.500 --> 42:19.940
bridge, doing like a fart piano solo, so like right there.

42:20.740 --> 42:23.220
I shouldn't find that as funny as I do.

42:23.220 --> 42:24.580
You certainly shouldn't.

42:24.580 --> 42:26.340
Why am I four years old?

42:27.860 --> 42:28.740
It's going to be good.

42:28.740 --> 42:29.220
It's going to be good.

42:29.220 --> 42:30.420
How many more weeks?

42:30.420 --> 42:34.020
Wait, I think you got like two more weeks to come up with something.

42:34.020 --> 42:39.140
But so Griffin will have something pretty sick by the time all is said and done.

42:39.140 --> 42:40.100
It's going to be pretty great.

42:41.060 --> 42:44.980
But we'll have to keep following his jingle progress for a stack soap.

42:44.980 --> 42:48.340
Hey, and if you're looking for a more racially sensitive podcast, might as

42:48.340 --> 42:51.220
suggest any on the Maximum Fun Network.

42:51.220 --> 42:53.540
Here's an ad for one right now.

42:56.820 --> 42:59.060
I'm Jesse Thorne, America's Radio Sweetheart.

42:59.060 --> 43:01.220
And I'm Jordan Morris, Bully Detective.

43:01.220 --> 43:06.260
Every week on our show, Jordan Jesse Go, I would say that we share a little slice

43:06.260 --> 43:10.580
of our hearts and a little peek at our dicks.

43:12.500 --> 43:17.380
But every week we have a podcast where we have fun and funny conversations with

43:17.380 --> 43:20.260
guests from the worlds of comedy, film, television.

43:20.260 --> 43:24.740
It's all online at Maximumfun.org or just search for Jordan Jesse Go in iTunes.

43:26.500 --> 43:30.820
Hey, are bulges in the crotch area of a guy's pants socially acceptable?

43:30.820 --> 43:34.020
My friend is poor and has very few pairs of pants.

43:34.820 --> 43:38.580
One he got recently at a Goodwill causes a rather noticeable man

43:38.580 --> 43:40.500
lump in his groin region.

43:40.500 --> 43:44.580
He asked me if they were OK and being a guy myself, I had no good answer for him.

43:44.580 --> 43:46.820
Do the ladies find this attractive?

43:46.820 --> 43:50.580
Are there specific social events where this kind of thing is accepted?

43:50.580 --> 43:51.460
Encouraged?

43:51.460 --> 43:54.420
That's from awkward in Arvana.

43:54.420 --> 43:59.860
Does this person think that this guy, when he bought the pants at Goodwill,

43:59.860 --> 44:01.940
it already had a boner in it?

44:03.940 --> 44:04.340
He didn't.

44:06.020 --> 44:08.180
I'm so confused as to the premise.

44:08.180 --> 44:12.580
Is this like the pants are so tight that you can see all the nooks and crannies?

44:12.580 --> 44:17.780
Or is this like because of like the way it's sewn and when you put on a belt,

44:17.780 --> 44:19.860
it just naturally like lumps up?

44:19.860 --> 44:24.900
Or are you saying your fucking buddy has got priapism

44:24.900 --> 44:26.900
and you don't know how to deal with that reality?

44:26.900 --> 44:34.180
I do think that if your friend has priapism, he's suffering from that.

44:34.180 --> 44:36.100
You do need to get convincing to see a doctor.

44:36.100 --> 44:37.460
That's your duty as a friend.

44:37.460 --> 44:42.820
Do these new pants rub against this thing in a way that is vaguely pleasurable?

44:43.700 --> 44:43.940
No.

44:47.620 --> 44:50.420
He just is a medical freak, is what you say.

44:50.420 --> 44:51.300
He likes new pants.

44:53.140 --> 44:54.820
He likes new old pants.

44:54.820 --> 44:56.260
He loves new old pants.

44:56.260 --> 45:01.620
Hey, you know, I as personally, I mean, personally, I love this.

45:01.620 --> 45:06.340
I love women have the ladies been walking around for like

45:08.020 --> 45:08.660
All time?

45:08.660 --> 45:10.340
Like long all time.

45:10.340 --> 45:11.540
10,000 years.

45:11.540 --> 45:13.620
Bosoms full blast.

45:13.620 --> 45:13.940
Yeah.

45:13.940 --> 45:16.900
Like the ladies have them cranked up.

45:16.900 --> 45:18.500
Can you turn down your bosoms, please?

45:18.500 --> 45:20.260
Because I can't hear you over your bosoms.

45:20.260 --> 45:25.620
The ladies turned up the bosoms full blast and then they tore off the knob.

45:25.620 --> 45:29.060
So I love that guys see that and say, you know what?

45:29.060 --> 45:30.740
I'm turning the tables on this.

45:30.740 --> 45:33.540
I'm going to go on my bulge on full blast.

45:33.540 --> 45:35.220
Now here is the caveat to this.

45:35.220 --> 45:36.660
The ladies will not enjoy that.

45:37.700 --> 45:39.700
It is not in any way intriguing.

45:39.700 --> 45:41.540
Well, maybe we're just not doing it right yet.

45:41.540 --> 45:46.020
Like maybe we need to come up with pants with a little slit so you can just see like,

45:46.020 --> 45:49.300
I don't know, a couple inches of the right side of the shaft.

45:50.340 --> 45:50.580
Yeah.

45:51.220 --> 45:53.460
You're talking like junk cleavage.

45:53.460 --> 45:55.620
That's what I'm talking about is shaft cleavage.

45:55.620 --> 45:56.420
Yeah.

45:56.420 --> 45:56.740
Sure.

45:56.740 --> 45:57.060
Why not?

45:57.060 --> 46:06.660
Why is it okay for ladies to show one third to like two fifths of a boob and that it's

46:06.660 --> 46:09.860
not okay for a guy to walk around with a little-

46:09.860 --> 46:15.460
With an inch to an inch and a half of clear plastic right down there just showing off

46:15.460 --> 46:17.700
one of the edges of the shaft.

46:17.700 --> 46:18.100
Just a-

46:18.100 --> 46:19.700
Maybe just some mesh.

46:19.700 --> 46:20.900
A vertical slice.

46:20.900 --> 46:26.820
Some mesh down there and the weave of the mesh is dependent on how formal the event

46:26.820 --> 46:27.300
you're going to.

46:27.300 --> 46:28.020
I love this.

46:28.020 --> 46:29.060
You're going-

46:29.060 --> 46:31.300
Oh, did you see his dicklitage?

46:31.300 --> 46:32.740
Oh, Christ.

46:32.740 --> 46:37.380
TM, don't plagiarize that, you fucking Zuckerberg thief.

46:37.380 --> 46:41.300
Zuck's friend, we're watching you.

46:41.300 --> 46:47.860
You know, you go to, if you're going to maybe a wedding or a funeral, you have a tasteful

46:47.860 --> 46:51.540
understated that may, dicklitage-

46:51.540 --> 46:54.900
You don't want to be, you don't want to distract from the groom's dicklitage.

46:54.900 --> 46:59.700
Right, maybe even it looks solid in certain lights.

46:59.700 --> 47:01.060
Ooh, that's a good look.

47:01.060 --> 47:02.740
Do you know who can make dicklitage look great?

47:02.740 --> 47:05.220
If you're at Clooney at the red carpet.

47:06.180 --> 47:06.820
Clooney.

47:06.820 --> 47:07.380
Clooney.

47:07.380 --> 47:08.180
Start this trend.

47:08.180 --> 47:11.460
He could go 2.5 inches of dicklitage down there.

47:11.460 --> 47:15.860
I don't want to think about it.

47:15.860 --> 47:18.900
Colin Farrell sets it off and pretends it's something they've been doing in Ireland for

47:18.900 --> 47:19.140
years.

47:19.140 --> 47:19.540
Sure.

47:19.540 --> 47:21.060
That makes it immediately cool.

47:21.060 --> 47:24.260
Yeah, over there, we call it cocklebloggers and something.

47:24.900 --> 47:28.660
And then, that's all the rage over there, the lads love it.

47:28.660 --> 47:29.780
The cocklebloggers.

47:29.780 --> 47:30.900
We've been wearing them since I was weak.

47:30.900 --> 47:31.380
Can you break that word?

47:31.380 --> 47:33.700
In an area over here, it's like, I'm in.

47:33.700 --> 47:34.180
I'm down.

47:35.380 --> 47:39.540
I think we just need to figure out what the appropriate amount of shaft to show is to

47:39.540 --> 47:42.820
get a woman to do the Diamond Dave double take.

47:42.820 --> 47:43.220
Yeah.

47:43.220 --> 47:46.500
Where she lowers her day glow plastic sunglasses.

47:46.500 --> 47:46.740
Yeah.

47:48.020 --> 47:50.500
And then, it does a triple like, bam, bam, bam.

47:50.500 --> 47:51.460
Like a zoom.

47:51.460 --> 47:57.300
I have this specially wired dicklitage that every time I peel it open, it plays a record

47:57.300 --> 48:00.100
scratch sound from my crosshair.

48:00.100 --> 48:02.580
Zip-a-dip-a-dip-a-dip-a-dip-bam.

48:02.580 --> 48:02.900
What?

48:03.940 --> 48:04.180
What?

48:04.180 --> 48:06.820
That's the sound a woman makes when she's doing a Diamond Dave double take.

48:06.820 --> 48:10.500
She does a fucking Scatman riff?

48:10.500 --> 48:12.500
She turns into Scatman Carruthers.

48:12.500 --> 48:12.820
Yeah.

48:14.260 --> 48:17.220
Well, if you guys have never made a woman do it, then I'm not surprised you don't know

48:17.220 --> 48:17.700
what she sounds like.

48:17.700 --> 48:22.900
I have never made a lady, I have never ever made a lady squee-de-beep with her mouth.

48:24.260 --> 48:26.180
But I've never experimented with dicklitage.

48:26.820 --> 48:27.140
Yep.

48:27.140 --> 48:27.380
Yeah.

48:28.340 --> 48:30.260
Well, I spent some time over in Europe, so.

48:31.060 --> 48:31.700
Oh, sure, sure.

48:31.700 --> 48:32.580
It's all the rage over there.

48:32.580 --> 48:33.780
Yeah, that explains it.

48:33.780 --> 48:35.780
My buddy Colin Farrell showed me what to do.

48:36.500 --> 48:37.540
I went to Burning Man.

48:37.540 --> 48:38.820
It was edible down there.

48:38.820 --> 48:39.620
What do I care?

48:40.500 --> 48:41.060
Set it off.

48:41.060 --> 48:42.420
It wasn't made to be edible.

48:42.420 --> 48:44.420
It wasn't made to be edible, but it was a long weekend.

48:45.380 --> 48:46.740
We all made a lot of mistakes.

48:46.740 --> 48:49.140
So I guess, yes?

48:49.140 --> 48:50.580
Is that, like, what's the answer?

48:50.580 --> 48:51.060
No?

48:51.060 --> 48:54.740
I don't, if you got a bulge, there's no guarantee it's not a tumor.

48:54.740 --> 48:54.980
Yeah.

48:54.980 --> 48:56.260
That's all I'm saying to you.

48:56.260 --> 48:57.780
I'll be worried about you if I see that.

48:58.500 --> 49:00.340
Hey, let's get you to, let's get that train.

49:00.340 --> 49:02.820
I can see your healthy shaft.

49:03.540 --> 49:04.740
A healthy few inches.

49:06.180 --> 49:06.900
Nothing wrong with that.

49:06.900 --> 49:07.780
Nothing wrong with that.

49:07.780 --> 49:10.820
That's gonna put my mind at ease, and you're gonna look good in the picture.

49:10.820 --> 49:11.860
You're gonna look good doing that.

49:13.060 --> 49:19.380
I also want to take a moment to say hi to our frequent listener, our grandmother, Nani.

49:19.380 --> 49:20.820
Oh, hi, Nani.

49:20.820 --> 49:24.420
Certainly enjoyed your visit this weekend, and I hope you got back to Florida safely.

49:26.020 --> 49:32.820
You'll find this special cut down version episode of this episode that we sent to you

49:32.820 --> 49:36.180
through Hotmail so that you can listen to it,

49:36.180 --> 49:38.740
and you won't hear all the stuff we said about dick tips and shafts.

49:39.700 --> 49:40.100
You're welcome.

49:40.100 --> 49:41.940
You're welcome. I love you.

49:41.940 --> 49:45.780
We make her a special Nani-friendly version every week.

49:45.780 --> 49:47.220
It is four and a half minutes long.

49:47.220 --> 49:52.260
We get Diplo and Cascade in the mix, and they do a remix version of us.

49:53.940 --> 49:57.220
Our Nani loves one thing, and that's for us to be chopped and screwed.

49:57.220 --> 49:58.980
Chopped and screwed, the Nani Club mix.

50:01.220 --> 50:04.980
Uh, can you read me a Yahoo, please?

50:04.980 --> 50:05.480
Sure.

50:05.480 --> 50:13.320
Um, I forgot about this one.

50:13.320 --> 50:15.480
This one was sent in by Golly and Yali.

50:16.760 --> 50:18.280
Thank you, Golly.

50:18.280 --> 50:22.040
It's by Yahoo Answers user Vampire Knight Fan.

50:22.040 --> 50:35.960
It asks, why did so many critics not like Without a Paddle?

50:35.960 --> 50:39.160
I mean, it was a good movie, had action, was really funny,

50:39.160 --> 50:41.640
and when I watched the movie, I was never bored.

50:41.640 --> 50:43.400
Was it really that bad?

50:43.400 --> 50:45.800
And if you don't know why critics didn't like it,

50:45.800 --> 50:48.200
then can you tell me what you think of the movie?

50:48.200 --> 50:53.240
Why did those Philistines not appreciate the beauty of Without a Paddle?

50:53.240 --> 50:57.320
All right, just a real quick, uh, I know we make a lot of references here that people don't get,

50:57.320 --> 51:01.000
and you would be excused for not being on board with this one.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.080
This stars, uh, Matt Lillard.

51:03.080 --> 51:04.600
Let's see, Matt Lillard.

51:04.600 --> 51:05.560
Dax Shepard.

51:05.560 --> 51:06.520
Dax Shepard.

51:06.520 --> 51:07.480
That's from memory.

51:07.480 --> 51:08.040
Seth Green.

51:08.040 --> 51:10.680
And Seth Green in one goddamn movie.

51:10.680 --> 51:11.960
I shit you not.

51:11.960 --> 51:15.560
And the three of these, these bros, these buddies are,

51:15.560 --> 51:20.840
these bros, these buddies are going on a camping expedition?

51:20.840 --> 51:24.120
I think they're mourning the passing of one of their friends by partying in the woods.

51:24.120 --> 51:24.760
Yeah, that's it.

51:24.760 --> 51:25.880
Let me, uh, to the Google.

51:26.920 --> 51:31.720
Yeah, uh, uh, so that's, that's, they reunite for the funeral of a childhood friend,

51:32.440 --> 51:35.080
and they start looking for treasure?

51:35.720 --> 51:35.960
Yeah?

51:35.960 --> 51:39.800
And they get somehow, they're criminals, they're dangerous criminals that get mixed up in the,

51:40.760 --> 51:41.320
get mixed up.

51:41.320 --> 51:44.360
The Apple Dumbling Gang is also looking for the treasure.

51:44.360 --> 51:45.560
Yeah, they're on a race to...

51:47.720 --> 51:48.600
Here's all I'm saying.

51:49.160 --> 51:53.960
Budget, 19 mil, gross, 58 mil in the USA alone.

51:53.960 --> 51:54.840
So sorry, haters.

51:54.840 --> 51:56.200
Hey, haters, what do you think about that?

51:56.760 --> 51:57.400
Oh, you gave it-

51:57.400 --> 51:58.040
Sorry, haters.

51:58.040 --> 52:00.840
You gave it no stars, Mr. Ebert?

52:01.480 --> 52:02.520
Well, guess what?

52:02.520 --> 52:04.600
It's got three, it's got three stars.

52:04.600 --> 52:06.760
Dax Shepard, Seth Green, and Matt Lillard.

52:07.320 --> 52:09.880
And 58 million dollars.

52:09.880 --> 52:12.680
And it won the Oscar for surprising as gross.

52:12.680 --> 52:13.560
That's amazing.

52:13.560 --> 52:14.840
58 million dollars?

52:15.640 --> 52:17.480
In the USA alone.

52:18.280 --> 52:20.360
We are dumb assholes.

52:20.360 --> 52:20.920
We don't deserve-

52:20.920 --> 52:23.000
And that's why they made Without a Paddle 2.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.360
And Scott Adzit is in it.

52:24.920 --> 52:25.240
Oh, is he?

52:25.240 --> 52:26.040
From 30 Rock.

52:26.040 --> 52:26.540
Oh.

52:27.320 --> 52:28.920
It's, it's a great movie.

52:30.920 --> 52:35.960
He's, Scott Adzit is in the film, credited as Greasy Man.

52:35.960 --> 52:42.600
Which, I love Scott Adzit, but that's, that's actually sounds pretty accurate.

52:43.400 --> 52:48.680
It actually has a, there was a person in the movie who was literally named Morgan Reese Fairhead.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.200
That is not a good name.

52:53.080 --> 52:53.560
Listen.

52:53.560 --> 52:55.400
How long was this movie?

52:55.400 --> 52:58.840
How long do people sit in the theater and nod and chuckle along?

52:58.840 --> 52:59.880
95 minutes.

52:59.880 --> 53:00.680
That sounds about right.

53:00.680 --> 53:04.120
The year was, yeah, it was, listen, we're, it was 2004.

53:04.120 --> 53:05.640
We're still trying to get over 9-11.

53:05.640 --> 53:06.600
You gotta cut us some slack.

53:06.600 --> 53:07.240
Yahoo Answers.

53:09.080 --> 53:11.880
I don't know how to tell you this, but the film wasn't very good.

53:11.880 --> 53:15.880
And so the critics said mean things about it because that her job, their job is to say,

53:15.880 --> 53:17.480
hey, this film wasn't very good.

53:17.480 --> 53:18.360
And here's how you know.

53:20.280 --> 53:21.560
It had Dax Shepard in it.

53:22.440 --> 53:23.240
Yeah.

53:23.240 --> 53:26.440
Well, see, I think it breaks down.

53:26.440 --> 53:31.480
Everyone individually has been involved with a quality production.

53:31.480 --> 53:36.520
You tell me what Dax Shepard was good in right now and I will eat my own head off my neck.

53:37.560 --> 53:41.880
Get ready to say goodbye to your head because he was amazing in Idiocracy.

53:42.600 --> 53:43.720
Sorry, Griffin.

53:43.720 --> 53:43.960
Fuck.

53:45.000 --> 53:45.320
Sorry.

53:51.080 --> 53:52.360
I can only reach for my lips.

53:55.800 --> 54:00.200
Seth Green was in Buffy and Matthew Lillard was in The Descendants.

54:00.200 --> 54:01.320
So what the fuck?

54:01.320 --> 54:01.960
I don't know.

54:03.960 --> 54:04.440
I don't know.

54:06.040 --> 54:10.360
You get these three together and it's a cinematic Holocaust.

54:12.200 --> 54:13.880
Sometimes they do okay.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.920
That was actually the tagline of the movie.

54:18.920 --> 54:21.720
Without a paddle, a cinematic Holocaust.

54:23.640 --> 54:29.000
On the section on IMDb where it says stars, Matthew Lillard, Seth Green, Dax Shepard.

54:29.000 --> 54:33.560
Uh, if you mouse over the word stars, there's actually a picture of Tom Hanks farting.

54:33.560 --> 54:38.920
It's kind of a weird commentary on that.

54:38.920 --> 54:41.880
Oh, my God.

54:41.880 --> 54:46.440
Um, so, uh, it seemed, I don't know why people didn't like it so much.

54:46.440 --> 54:51.080
Um, were there any responses from, oh God, were there some responses from defenders of

54:51.080 --> 54:51.720
the film?

54:51.720 --> 54:52.600
I can only dream.

54:53.400 --> 54:55.240
I mean, there's just some shit.

54:55.240 --> 54:56.760
Hey guys, Seth Green here.

54:56.760 --> 54:57.800
I thought it was great.

54:57.800 --> 54:59.880
Because critics can't put bias into it.

54:59.880 --> 55:04.280
They look at it like you would look at a short story if you were analyzing it.

55:04.280 --> 55:08.840
They look at things we don't really concern about like cinematography, speech, camera

55:08.840 --> 55:11.080
angles, et cetera, script, especially.

55:11.080 --> 55:11.800
But I agree.

55:11.800 --> 55:14.760
Most good movies get negative to mixed reviews.

55:14.760 --> 55:16.680
Hey, no, they don't.

55:16.680 --> 55:21.240
Did they say one of the things that critics pick on that they shouldn't is script?

55:21.240 --> 55:22.840
They actually said speech.

55:22.840 --> 55:28.760
So, Matthew Lillard, I have to say your one, your line delivery in the scene where the

55:28.760 --> 55:36.200
canoe flipped and all of Seth Green's weed got wet and he said, oh, my dank herb is ruined.

55:37.400 --> 55:38.520
I was not convinced.

55:38.520 --> 55:39.320
No stars.

55:41.640 --> 55:47.880
Um, I don't mean to be elitist here, but cinematography is basically what makes a movie a

55:47.880 --> 55:48.360
movie.

55:48.360 --> 55:48.680
Yeah.

55:48.680 --> 55:49.640
So it's a pretty big deal.

55:49.640 --> 55:51.320
Because if it wasn't that, it would be a book.

55:51.320 --> 55:56.840
On tape, and then you'd have to hear Seth Green said, oh, yes, you soaked my gansh.

55:57.400 --> 55:57.880
What?

55:58.920 --> 55:59.400
What?

56:00.840 --> 56:04.200
I have two reviews for you.

56:04.200 --> 56:06.040
I'd like to read without a paddle.

56:07.800 --> 56:15.720
The first comes to us from John J Puccio from movie Metropolis says, maybe the filmmakers

56:15.720 --> 56:18.600
should have called this picture without a laugh.

56:18.600 --> 56:19.560
That is funny.

56:19.560 --> 56:23.560
Without a laugh, that is from his review of the film.

56:23.560 --> 56:25.400
Just below, we have another review.

56:25.400 --> 56:29.320
I kept looking and hoping for a laugh that never came.

56:29.880 --> 56:33.880
John J Puccio without a paddle, Blu-ray edition.

56:33.880 --> 56:41.960
So this fucking hero cracks open the Blu-ray and thinks maybe this time the Yahoo Answers

56:41.960 --> 56:44.440
user saw something I didn't.

56:44.440 --> 56:51.720
And maybe on the Blu-ray I can see that thread, but no, but he did go back to give it another

56:51.720 --> 56:52.200
shot.

56:52.200 --> 56:56.680
So don't say that he doesn't know his business because he most certainly does.

56:56.680 --> 57:02.840
So I found a copy of the without a paddle full script transcription on the Internet

57:02.840 --> 57:08.600
and I'll be honest, I spent the last minute or so searching for words like toot just to

57:08.600 --> 57:13.000
see if like Matthew Lillard toots as italicized action.

57:13.000 --> 57:17.320
Matthew Lillard toots as a bear smokes weed nearby.

57:19.480 --> 57:21.640
And the bear says, man, this dank is wet.

57:24.680 --> 57:29.000
Then Danny DeVito appears for a brief uncredited cameo as the bear.

57:32.600 --> 57:34.120
I really want to watch this movie right now.

57:34.120 --> 57:35.000
Yeah, I know.

57:35.000 --> 57:43.800
I pretty much want to it has become my new Inspector Gadget tube, my new white whale.

57:43.800 --> 57:45.320
I've got to see it and watch it.

57:45.320 --> 57:49.240
We need to start having my brother, my brother, me viewing parties where we invite a bunch

57:49.240 --> 57:49.560
of people.

57:50.120 --> 57:51.320
God damn it.

57:51.320 --> 57:52.680
OK, Rotten Tomatoes.

57:53.400 --> 57:58.760
The percentage of positive reviews that it received from critics is 14 percent.

57:58.760 --> 58:04.760
The number of positive reviews it received from the audience that watched it, 73 percent.

58:04.760 --> 58:09.240
Whoa, we are every 99 percent, by which I mean, 73 percent.

58:09.720 --> 58:12.840
That is this is how I'd like to point out that I'm sorry.

58:12.840 --> 58:14.040
I'm math don't lie.

58:14.040 --> 58:19.960
What they've said there is that that 14 percent of critics that when like the audience will

58:19.960 --> 58:22.280
love this, they were right.

58:22.840 --> 58:24.440
Like they called it.

58:24.440 --> 58:28.520
Yeah, they I mean, 14 percent of critics were I mean, is that is that true?

58:28.520 --> 58:29.320
I mean, is that accurate?

58:29.320 --> 58:34.840
Like 40 percent of critics or were somehow more have their finger on their Hollywood

58:34.840 --> 58:36.120
elite there.

58:36.120 --> 58:42.440
They are New York liberals and they are tearing our country apart and they are raiding our

58:42.440 --> 58:49.160
Doc Shepherd movies unfairly and they are a cancer on the organ of this country.

58:49.160 --> 58:51.160
That is American made cinema.

58:51.160 --> 58:54.520
That's just where I'm at is all those things I just said.

58:56.520 --> 59:02.920
Rich Klein says looks like another gross out farce, but it's actually a genuinely engaging

59:02.920 --> 59:04.600
comic adventure.

59:04.600 --> 59:05.400
Wow.

59:05.960 --> 59:07.960
Is it is it any of those things?

59:07.960 --> 59:10.680
And my brother, Dax Shepard, was awesome in it.

59:11.640 --> 59:12.120
Oh, my God.

59:12.120 --> 59:12.600
Oh, my God.

59:12.600 --> 59:13.320
Oh, my God.

59:13.320 --> 59:17.880
This is from Vince Koehler and entertainment spectrum yet another one of the few critics

59:17.880 --> 59:21.240
that really had his finger on the pulse enough to know that America would love this movie.

59:21.960 --> 59:26.280
These guys get in a way over their heads stuck in the wilderness.

59:26.280 --> 59:31.720
The cover, the fucking poster is them standing in the water and the water is over their heads.

59:31.720 --> 59:33.240
This dude didn't watch the movie.

59:33.240 --> 59:34.520
He just looked at the poster.

59:35.400 --> 59:39.160
Now you can tell he watched the movie because his next sentence is the characters are developed.

59:39.160 --> 59:40.920
So the audience cares for the guys.

59:40.920 --> 59:45.000
The characters laugh when funny things happen and cry when it is sad.

59:45.000 --> 59:50.040
Amy Biancolli says it's a successfully infantile new spin on Deliverance.

59:50.040 --> 59:52.280
What the fuck do you laugh at?

59:52.280 --> 59:54.280
Like, what do you think is hysterical?

59:54.920 --> 01:00:02.680
I hear the original cut of the script was Matt Lillard and Dax and is it cool if I just

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:03.240
call him Dax?

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:03.800
I don't know.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:04.360
I don't know.

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:04.920
I don't know.

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:05.400
I don't know.

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:05.960
I don't know.

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:06.440
I don't know.

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:06.920
I don't know.

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:07.480
I don't know.

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.040
I don't know.

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:08.680
I don't know.

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:09.240
I don't know.

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:09.720
I don't know.

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:10.280
I don't know.

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:11.160
Is it cool if I just call him Dax?

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:13.560
Because I'm pretty sure everybody knows who I'm talking about when I just say Dax.

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:13.800
Sure.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:14.040
Yeah.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:14.840
Everybody knows Dax.

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:21.720
So Matt Lillard, Dax, and Seth Green go river rafting to have secret gay sex with each other.

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:27.560
It's called With a Paddle was the original title.

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:33.000
They changed it because they didn't think loose anal play would freak some people out.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.280
So Americans with your pretension and conventional attitudes towards loose anal play.

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:42.840
I bet you that if that shit had included loose anal play, then guess what?

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:46.520
That 17% would have been closer to 80, 82.

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.440
It would have gotten a certified fresh sticker.

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:49.880
Yep.

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:50.280
Think about it.

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:50.680
How about it?

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.480
Think about that.

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:53.080
How about it Without a Paddle 2?

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:57.880
There's already Without a Paddle 2 called Without a Paddle Nature's Calling that I'm

01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:58.520
reading about right now.

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.440
How about it Without a Paddle 3?

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:02.120
Grin and-

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:03.000
Without a Paddle 3D.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:03.880
Grin and bear it.

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:10.040
And then, but there's this, there's a bear, but also it's a talking about sodomy, I guess.

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.360
There's sodomy and also bears there.

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:15.160
Dax Shepard's back doing his thing.

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.320
Oh my God.

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:17.880
Oh my God.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.080
There are two reviews.

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:19.880
Still reading them.

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:21.880
Without a Paddle Nature's Calling.

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:30.120
One of them is from John J. Puccio of Movie Metropolis back for round three.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:40.440
I want this to spiral into a giant tribe about like the consciousness of America.

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:41.240
We are the paddle.

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:44.840
He just wants to understand.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:45.960
The paddle is all of us.

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:50.920
We are the river of life that flows through Dax Shepard.

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:57.000
And in doing so, we absorbed our own Dax Shepard and each of us are Dax and we are no Dax and

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.040
we love Dax, but in the end, we die with him.

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:00.760
Dax is all.

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:03.000
Dax is all.

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:09.560
When it finally comes out of like the third one comes direct to Game Boy.

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:14.360
Now I get it.

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:16.520
Press B to drop your weed in the river.

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:19.800
Oh, when the third prequel comes out.

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:20.200
Yeah.

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:22.120
Then it ties the other two together.

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:23.880
Without a battle, with a battle.

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:29.480
The third triumvirate, The Legend of Carly's Gold.

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:32.360
Without a battle three, try not to lose this battle.

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:33.240
Seriously, boys.

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:41.160
John's snippet is clearly the words frivolous and scatterbrained are in play here.

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:44.760
When you have been loved him in there when they were assigning the review for

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.360
Without a Paddle, Nature's Calling.

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.080
No, guys, I got.

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:52.440
Hey, Pooch, you're pretty much an expert on this, right?

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:52.760
Please.

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:54.200
Yeah, I got this, guys.

01:02:54.200 --> 01:03:01.240
This is my possibility that Poochiano was the only person who saw this movie,

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:03.560
but he paid 58 million dollars to do so.

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.880
He's a little steep, but I got to find out how these characters are developed

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:09.480
because I already really like him.

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:11.960
He's seen it at least twice.

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:18.040
By the way, Without a Paddle, Nature's Calling, 22% of the audience enjoyed that.

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:21.320
It's a pretty stark drop. So we are growing as a country.

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:23.180
Wow.

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:29.400
This has been our Without a Paddle fancast, my brother, my brother, and me.

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:32.600
Thank you again for hanging out with us.

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:39.320
If you can take a second this week and you say,

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:42.440
this show is free, I love it, I wish I could pay for it.

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:46.920
Well, what you can do is tell somebody you know to listen.

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:52.440
You give them a link to our sampler, bit.ly forward slash it's my bim bam.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.320
And you send them to that, it's 14 minutes of YouTube gold.

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:00.040
And here's how this pyramid scheme works.

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:04.360
You tell them it costs a dollar to listen to, payable directly to you.

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:04.600
Right.

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:06.920
That's how you make the money.

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:10.600
We get the ears, you get the cash, it works out for everybody.

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:19.960
Also, you can follow us on Twitter, we're at mbmbam in the common parlance.

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:23.720
And if you could also tweet about the show this week,

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:29.400
maybe throw a link to the sampler up and then use the mbmbam hashtag.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:38.280
Like so many people like DJ Pizzazz, Dirty Mustard, Kyle Mac 13,

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:44.200
Andy Talks A Lot, Dylan Duarte, Not Brandon Crane, Parsip Zilla,

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:49.960
our old friend Crystal Whalen, Omnitarian, Captain Novoland, just started.

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:57.000
Hopefully he's enjoying the show and everybody, thank you so much for tweeting about it.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000
And that's because that's the only way we really have to spread the show's influence.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.560
So it means a lot.

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:08.440
Yeah, it means a lot. Make sure you go and check out AppleandKiwiComics.com

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:14.920
and if you would like to either have us awkwardly talk about your business or website,

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:20.200
or if you'd like us to awkwardly wish you or someone you love happy birthday or happy anniversary,

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:23.880
you can go to MaximumFun.org forward slash Jumbotron

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:29.720
and get a message on either our show or any one of the awesome MaximumFun.org shows.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:31.880
I want to thank John Rodgers. Can I do that?

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:34.040
Yeah, be quick.

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:36.600
Thanks to John Rodgers and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song,

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:39.800
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed, which is our theme song.

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:45.480
Go buy it. I've told you to do it 100 times and I'm sure you've done it twice already

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:50.440
because you respect my time and you know how valuable it is.

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:52.520
And you know what's good for you.

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.120
You know what's good for you. I'm not going to lie,

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:57.880
I am reading the script without a paddle, have been doing it for a while.

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:00.360
Still into it, still feeling it.

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.280
It is incomprehensible.

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.880
And go discuss Without a Paddle on our forums.

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:13.320
Don't mention this episode, just start talking about Without a Paddle in the thread for this

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:18.120
show and it will make people who do not listen to the show completely lose their goddamn minds.

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:20.200
Swap stories, swap fanfic.

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:24.120
Maybe I want this third movie to get made.

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:27.960
I want to see how the epic trilogy comes to an end,

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:30.520
or maybe just a 3D remake in theaters would be fun too.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.760
I want to see how this episode comes to an end.

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:34.520
Yeah, me too.

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:39.880
And it's with a question from the Yahoo answer service that Griffin's going to read to us

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:42.040
to kind of just ease us into the week.

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.040
Something to think about and we'll come back to next time.

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:47.560
Sure. This final Yahoo answer was sent in by Jacob Locker.

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:48.200
Thank you, Jacob.

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:52.280
It's by Yahoo answers user android5000 who asks,

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:57.080
Could Dragon Ball Z be possible in some way?

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:02.200
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.080
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:05.720
Is that a Dragon Ball?

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:07.640
This is me, my brother, my brother and me.

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:08.600
Kiss your dads.

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:23.560
Swear on the lips.

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:26.680
Keep your heart, three stacks.

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:26.680
Keep your heart, hey, keep your heart, three stacks, keep your heart, man, these girls are smart, three stacks, these girls are smart.

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:44.680
I'm Travis McElroy, and I'll see you next time.
