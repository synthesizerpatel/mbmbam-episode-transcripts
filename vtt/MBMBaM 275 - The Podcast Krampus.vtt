00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.080
Hello, welcome to my brother and my brother mean advice show for the modern era. My name

00:48.080 --> 00:52.240
is Justin McElroy. I'm your oldest brother. My name is Travis McElroy. I'm your middle

00:52.240 --> 00:59.200
brother. I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Check that calendar. What day is it?

00:59.200 --> 01:02.400
It just, I just see a bunch of ones. It's just all ones.

01:02.400 --> 01:07.840
Nav one. Nav one, and you know what that means. Punch it. That Christmas creep is on.

01:07.840 --> 01:13.280
Punch it to 88 miles an hour. Happy anniversary. Back to the future.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.880
Today was the day. Today was it.

01:16.880 --> 01:20.160
They took down his Halloween decorations and back to the future and put up his

01:20.160 --> 01:23.760
Christmas decorations. We on that creep now, guys. I'm excited.

01:23.760 --> 01:28.240
That creep popped off. Nav one. That means the creep is on.

01:28.240 --> 01:31.760
Halloween's over. Halloween's done with. That means there's no more holidays until

01:31.760 --> 01:35.600
the holidays. Isn't it weird how you can leave your

01:35.600 --> 01:40.640
Christmas decorations up for a little while, but if you have your Halloween decorations up

01:40.640 --> 01:45.920
one day after Halloween, you're a sicko. You just look like a sicko pervert.

01:45.920 --> 01:49.840
I like your pumpkin there, pervert. You weirdo. What did you want to hold onto

01:49.840 --> 01:54.320
that death, huh? A death and despair. Oh, you carved out Master Chief's face

01:54.320 --> 01:59.760
and a pumpkin. That's really great, pervert. That's really good for you, pervert.

01:59.760 --> 02:03.680
You should be very proud of yourself. Yeah, spooky skeleton in that tree, I see.

02:03.680 --> 02:08.960
Maybe, you know, like I've got kids, so... I gotta tell you, maybe it's a Christmas

02:08.960 --> 02:13.040
creep side effect, but by the time Christmas is done, I'm like,

02:13.040 --> 02:17.920
woof. Okay, good. Thank you. Goodbye, Christmas. I enjoy you very much.

02:17.920 --> 02:22.320
So happy to have you gone. I feel like I didn't even get enough Halloween

02:22.320 --> 02:24.720
this year, and I was really trying to get deep into it.

02:24.720 --> 02:28.560
I really like a Halloween extension. The problem is, Justin, because I thought

02:28.560 --> 02:33.920
about this. Everybody accepts that Christmas, you can start celebrating on November 1st,

02:33.920 --> 02:37.920
right? You can start decorating, and the music plays, and everyone's like, yeah.

02:37.920 --> 02:43.360
But if you start doing Halloween stuff, if you dress up on October 21st,

02:43.920 --> 02:49.600
people are like, what the fuck? No, Danny, it's more than a week away. Be cool.

02:49.600 --> 02:56.800
Cool. My local Rite Aid started, like, I went there this morning, right?

02:57.440 --> 03:03.920
And the creep had, like, just disassembled. Like, there's people just throwing piles of

03:03.920 --> 03:08.080
Dracula's out the window. Like, please, make room for Santa's, please.

03:08.080 --> 03:14.720
I went to a Marshall's the other day. Yesterday. The Halloween day. All Hallows Eve.

03:14.720 --> 03:20.080
I fucking walked up in that spot, and they had Halloween stuff next to Christmas stuff.

03:20.080 --> 03:24.960
It was like the creep was starting to encroach. Like, oh, come on. Get out of here,

03:24.960 --> 03:28.400
Dracula's. You're done. You're done. You're done. All Dracula's must go.

03:28.400 --> 03:31.920
It was weird seeing them in the same place. Like, oh, Santa versus Dracula. That would be

03:32.560 --> 03:39.760
fucking sick. I went to the Halloween store, and I heard somebody asking if everything went on sale

03:39.760 --> 03:46.960
the day after Halloween. And it occurred to me, like, they're probably just going to box that up

03:46.960 --> 03:51.520
and sell it again next year, right? There's not big shifts. No, we got to get the new models.

03:51.520 --> 03:56.480
We're going to get the 2016 Dracula's in here. Much more streamlined with cup holders.

03:56.480 --> 04:00.480
These days have three sharp fangs. Everybody knows that. That's what the kids are into.

04:00.480 --> 04:02.400
You know that new Dracula you've been looking for?

04:03.680 --> 04:09.360
Do you guys remember on the last episode, I talked about batting zero out of a thousand

04:09.360 --> 04:12.320
for putting on Halloween costumes that anybody recognizes?

04:13.440 --> 04:19.760
That after last night, my perfect record of badness has not changed.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.800
Yeah. No recognition.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.800
I got a kick out of your costume, which was a...

04:23.920 --> 04:26.720
It was a birdhouse in your soul. I bought a birdhouse at Target,

04:26.720 --> 04:29.920
because I didn't buy a costume until yesterday at, like, 4 p.m.

04:29.920 --> 04:34.400
And we were going to a thing at 545, and so I went to the Target. It's really on me. Like,

04:34.400 --> 04:37.440
I have no one to blame but myself, and I saw a birdhouse. I was like, that'll do.

04:37.440 --> 04:41.840
That didn't do. It didn't. That didn't do for anybody.

04:41.840 --> 04:44.480
It didn't. That dog did not hunt.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.320
No. That dog sat on the floor.

04:46.320 --> 04:49.200
You did fashion a harness for it, which I thought was quite impressive.

04:49.200 --> 04:52.560
Staple gun and elastic. So you were in that thing, huh?

04:52.560 --> 04:57.360
I was in it to win it. Made it really hard to piss. Had a big birdhouse right there.

04:57.360 --> 04:58.160
My sight lines.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.480
Well, the spooky times are over, and we all met Christmas creeps now.

05:04.480 --> 05:10.080
And thank God. It was getting a little too spooky for me. I don't know how it treated you guys,

05:10.080 --> 05:14.080
but, like, one of my neighbors went all out. It had mummies in their yard. Mummies?

05:14.080 --> 05:16.000
You don't think that's taken a little too far?

05:18.160 --> 05:19.440
Did that scare you, Griffin?

05:19.440 --> 05:23.440
Mummies are real, though, is the thing. Like, people actually did that to people.

05:23.440 --> 05:24.080
You know what I mean?

05:24.720 --> 05:26.640
Yeah. Mummies are real.

05:26.640 --> 05:30.640
Skeletons, I guess, are kind of real because they're inside you, but they can't do anything.

05:30.640 --> 05:34.960
Mummies were real. Mummies were and are and will be real.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.240
Mummies alive, right now.

05:36.960 --> 05:42.320
Guys, listen. Mummies alive. That show's title was a fucking warning.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.080
Mummies alive.

05:44.080 --> 05:44.480
Hey, guys.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.080
Hey, listen. Speaking of being on that creep,

05:47.280 --> 05:53.360
tickets are now on sale for our Candle Nights Holiday Family Fun Spectacular.

05:53.360 --> 05:59.040
It's a pan-religious, pan-sexual, personal pan holiday just for you.

05:59.040 --> 06:03.680
And tickets are on sale now if you go to bit.ly forward slash Candle Nights 2.

06:04.480 --> 06:08.880
And we've sold a good number of tickets already. Like, a solid number.

06:08.880 --> 06:11.600
But there's an even better number of tickets still available.

06:11.600 --> 06:12.160
Yeah.

06:12.160 --> 06:15.040
So go get those and then come to Huntington with us.

06:15.920 --> 06:19.200
Are we doing costumes for that? Because we had costumes last year and it was pretty fun,

06:19.200 --> 06:22.320
but I don't know what other, other than the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future,

06:22.320 --> 06:24.960
like what other trio of, I guess, wise men?

06:25.520 --> 06:28.640
We could do the wise men. That seems pretty on the nose.

06:28.640 --> 06:29.520
It seems, yeah.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.880
And I like it. Don't get me wrong. On the nose. And I like it.

06:32.880 --> 06:36.800
See, Griffin, that's your problem with costumes. It's okay if it's recognizable.

06:36.800 --> 06:37.280
I went to a party last night.

06:37.280 --> 06:39.680
You can do a thing that people go like, oh, I get it.

06:39.680 --> 06:42.720
I went to a party last night where I didn't know literally anybody,

06:42.720 --> 06:46.560
and I was near a table getting a drink and there were a bunch of people sitting at the table

06:46.560 --> 06:50.480
whispering and finally one woman like stood up and was like, sorry, what is your costume?

06:50.480 --> 06:52.800
I was like, oh, it's a birdhouse from your soul.

06:52.800 --> 06:56.480
And she was like, I don't- I was like, oh, it's like the They Might Be Giants song.

06:56.480 --> 06:59.440
And somebody at the table yelled, what is it? What's his costume?

06:59.440 --> 07:03.280
And she yelled back, she yelled back, something esoteric.

07:03.280 --> 07:04.960
And I was like, yeah, I guess that's-

07:04.960 --> 07:07.600
And did you then just turn and walk right out the door?

07:07.600 --> 07:08.960
Because that's what I would have done.

07:08.960 --> 07:10.000
Yeah, I would have left.

07:10.720 --> 07:15.040
So come to our holiday show. It's going to be really good.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.400
And I'm going to try to make it more Jewish this year.

07:18.400 --> 07:22.160
Last year was very Christmas-y and I'm going to try to make it more-

07:22.720 --> 07:24.480
Well, we're going to do a rotation.

07:24.480 --> 07:25.440
Okay.

07:25.440 --> 07:28.320
That's the good thing about candle lights. It can- it can- it's amorphous.

07:29.360 --> 07:30.320
I actually wanted to-

07:30.320 --> 07:33.280
It can actually be a little spooky. We could have some Jewish mummies up there.

07:33.280 --> 07:34.960
I don't even joke about that.

07:34.960 --> 07:39.600
Yes. I actually have struggled with this and maybe listeners can like give us some guidance here.

07:39.600 --> 07:45.600
I know like what stuff- like I know that pretty much anything Christmas-y is like

07:46.560 --> 07:51.520
fair- fair use, right? In terms of like being fun.

07:51.520 --> 07:56.400
Hahaha. But like I don't know with like Jewish stuff.

07:56.400 --> 08:01.120
I don't know what is like a fit- like it seems like a lot of that stuff is holy.

08:01.120 --> 08:05.280
And I didn't- like I made a video, a dumb video, promoting candle lights.

08:05.280 --> 08:08.800
And I needed to put- I wanted to put something like- I had some Christmas-y,

08:08.800 --> 08:11.040
Santa-type stuff and I wanted to put something Jewish in it.

08:11.680 --> 08:13.840
And I was going to have like a cool menorah on a table.

08:13.840 --> 08:16.480
But like I don't know if that's holy or not. Is that holy?

08:16.480 --> 08:16.880
That's cool.

08:16.880 --> 08:20.800
Is that not allowed? I ended up going with a dreidel because that seems pretty benign.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.480
That's about as innocuous as it gets.

08:22.480 --> 08:29.120
Yeah, a menorah is totally cool, dude. That is the Hanukkah equivalent of a Christmas tree.

08:29.120 --> 08:31.840
But I have to know the limits of the symbology, Griffin.

08:31.840 --> 08:36.560
If I stay on that stage and use a menorah to light an American flag on fire-

08:36.560 --> 08:39.600
Well that's taking it a touch too far, my boy.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.360
Yeah, I don't know where the line is, Griffin.

08:41.360 --> 08:43.200
That's what I'm saying. I don't know where the line is.

08:43.200 --> 08:46.320
Hold on. You say you would light an American flag on fire with a menorah

08:46.320 --> 08:48.320
and you don't know that that's over the line?

08:48.320 --> 08:50.240
No, I would assume the line is there.

08:50.240 --> 08:53.440
Like, I definitely see that as an outside boundary of the line.

08:53.440 --> 08:57.280
When you take three to four steps back from that, I have no idea where I'm at.

08:57.280 --> 09:02.640
If I rigged a menorah to shoot Nickelodeon Gak out at the audience-

09:02.640 --> 09:05.440
That would be fucking sick. Everyone would love that.

09:05.440 --> 09:09.600
I don't think so. I think it would be offensive to people. I really do.

09:10.160 --> 09:13.120
Well, offensive to people in the splash zone, sure.

09:13.120 --> 09:16.720
Sure. Well, they saw the signs outside.

09:16.720 --> 09:20.800
It's not- You may get wet. You will get wet

09:21.360 --> 09:24.240
with holy menorah emissions. You may get gacked.

09:24.240 --> 09:25.920
Yeah, you may get gacked. I don't know.

09:25.920 --> 09:28.240
It was- All right, let's do the show.

09:28.240 --> 09:30.080
Yeah, we'll talk about this afterwards.

09:30.960 --> 09:33.040
It's a fair point. I was-

09:33.040 --> 09:34.320
It's a fair- Yes.

09:34.320 --> 09:37.440
We're young Southern Baptist boys that just don't want to step on anybody's toes,

09:37.440 --> 09:41.600
but we want to be as inclusive of our Jewish friends as possible because it is a-

09:41.600 --> 09:45.200
Then we have to have a Gak Christmas tree and a Gak Kwanzaa.

09:45.200 --> 09:50.400
And we need some non-religious, just general, like, solstice stuff up there.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.320
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, for sure.

09:52.320 --> 09:56.560
And I don't actually- Maybe somebody could tell me, like,

09:56.560 --> 10:02.480
can I even dip my toe into Kwanzaa? Can I even drive by Kwanzaa and take a look?

10:02.480 --> 10:04.480
Of course. Of course.

10:04.480 --> 10:08.240
You can window shop Kwanzaa. I'm not going to be part of the problem.

10:09.040 --> 10:13.520
Dear Mabim Bam, I ordered pizza the other day with my friend. Since my friend was at the house,

10:13.520 --> 10:18.240
I did the courtesy of paying for the pizza. When we finished the delicious za, there were leftovers.

10:18.240 --> 10:24.240
My friend then proceeded to start packing up the leftovers in order to take them home,

10:24.240 --> 10:26.640
even though I paid for the pizza.

10:26.640 --> 10:30.720
Am I within my rights to keep the leftovers, or should I stop being so fussy?

10:30.720 --> 10:33.360
The pizza cost $40. That's a good pizza.

10:33.360 --> 10:35.520
What? Including delivery, which is fairly expensive.

10:35.520 --> 10:38.000
For just you and one other person? How much za?

10:38.000 --> 10:40.800
This is my foie gras pizza. Did you have a-

10:40.800 --> 10:43.280
Did you each get your own fucking pizza?

10:43.280 --> 10:46.960
Did you have a stack of eight leftover pizzas, like the family at home alone?

10:46.960 --> 10:49.120
Like, is that why they thought they could have some?

10:50.720 --> 10:54.160
Considering work part-time, am I within my rights to keep the leftovers,

10:54.160 --> 11:02.560
or should I stop being so fussy? That's from Sherwood likes some pizza in Sherwood Park.

11:05.760 --> 11:06.480
What's up, Griff?

11:07.440 --> 11:09.680
It's just their friend has committed so many-

11:10.480 --> 11:11.360
Pizza crimes.

11:11.360 --> 11:15.360
Pizza crimes here. It's like, first of all, the person who pays for the pizza

11:15.360 --> 11:18.240
should most of the time keep the pizza.

11:18.240 --> 11:22.800
The only thing that can be like a variable in that situation is who is hosting the evening.

11:22.800 --> 11:28.240
Because by taking a pizza that you broke bread with somebody in their house,

11:28.240 --> 11:31.120
and then you take it out of their house, that's theft.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.720
That's theft, according to the law.

11:33.280 --> 11:33.840
It's theft.

11:33.840 --> 11:36.800
It's just- Okay, here's the scenario that works out.

11:36.800 --> 11:40.000
Like, you apparently ordered six pizzas.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.720
There's five whole pizzas left over, and they say,

11:42.720 --> 11:44.000
please take some.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.160
That we don't have room to store all of this pizza.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.400
No, we insist, take some with you.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.240
But to just like finish the day, I'm like,

11:50.240 --> 11:53.840
well, guess I'll be heading home.

11:53.840 --> 11:56.000
As you like scoop it into your backpack.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.120
Get the fuck out.

11:57.120 --> 12:00.000
Because did you like ask for like Ziploc bags?

12:00.000 --> 12:00.720
You- Yeah.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.680
Oh, you're the worst.

12:01.680 --> 12:02.400
You're the worst.

12:02.400 --> 12:03.680
This is the worst.

12:03.680 --> 12:04.240
Let me- Let me-

12:04.960 --> 12:07.280
The payment issue like completely solidifies it.

12:07.280 --> 12:09.840
You paid it, your house, your pizza, that's theft.

12:09.840 --> 12:10.720
Pizza crime.

12:10.720 --> 12:12.880
I'm calling the pizza police right now,

12:12.880 --> 12:14.400
and they're gonna kick in this person's door.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.760
Send me their information.

12:15.760 --> 12:16.560
I'm not a cop.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.000
I have to, I would have to tell you if I am,

12:18.000 --> 12:18.880
but I know cops.

12:19.920 --> 12:20.640
Pizza cops.

12:23.120 --> 12:26.160
If you bring a six pack of beer to a person's house,

12:26.160 --> 12:27.760
and you don't finish that six pack,

12:28.720 --> 12:30.320
you still leave it at their house, right?

12:30.320 --> 12:32.400
Because it's their- It's a party payment.

12:32.400 --> 12:33.520
It's their house.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.120
At that point, it's their house.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.680
I want to drink those beers later,

12:37.680 --> 12:39.920
and I'm going to drink some more beers when I go home,

12:39.920 --> 12:41.360
and I don't have any at home.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.800
But it is important in that scenario

12:42.800 --> 12:45.760
that you leave some sort of toll or tax,

12:45.760 --> 12:47.200
where you, like, if you have a six pack,

12:47.200 --> 12:48.480
you drink two, there's four left.

12:48.480 --> 12:49.520
You leave at least one.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.000
Or just leave a small toy.

12:52.800 --> 12:53.840
That also works.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.120
You just have to swap it out,

12:55.120 --> 12:57.680
or like a bag of sand the same weight

12:57.680 --> 12:59.200
as the beer that you're taking.

12:59.200 --> 12:59.760
Exactly.

13:01.360 --> 13:04.640
I would challenge, Travis,

13:04.640 --> 13:07.920
I would challenge your assertion that if someone

13:09.200 --> 13:11.200
offers leftover pizza,

13:11.200 --> 13:13.280
that you are then permitted to take it.

13:13.280 --> 13:16.560
I would challenge it based on an irrefutable law

13:16.560 --> 13:18.560
that I've been working on called

13:18.560 --> 13:21.840
the elasticity of pizza deliciousness.

13:21.840 --> 13:22.800
And here's how it works.

13:23.440 --> 13:25.360
After you finish pizza,

13:25.360 --> 13:27.040
and you've eaten a lot of pizza,

13:27.040 --> 13:28.480
you look at the pizza,

13:28.480 --> 13:31.760
and you think, ugh, never again.

13:31.760 --> 13:34.160
I'm destroying my human body with pizza.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.000
I'm never gonna eat pizza again.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.840
Everybody, take some of this pizza with you,

13:37.840 --> 13:38.480
because I don't want it.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.480
I'm just gonna throw it in the garbage.

13:40.480 --> 13:41.840
The next morning you wake up,

13:41.840 --> 13:44.320
it's 11 o'clock, you're a little bit hungover.

13:44.320 --> 13:47.360
You would move heaven or earth

13:47.360 --> 13:49.840
to get one of those toasty slices

13:49.840 --> 13:51.280
right into your belly.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.800
They knew that.

13:52.800 --> 13:55.520
I'm saying this law is so universal

13:55.520 --> 13:57.760
that you should not legally be permitted

13:57.760 --> 13:59.920
to take leftover pizza under any circumstances.

13:59.920 --> 14:03.440
But what if there's not room to store it

14:03.440 --> 14:04.560
in your refrigerator?

14:04.560 --> 14:05.280
That's not the case.

14:05.280 --> 14:07.280
Stop throwing bullshit variables into this.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.280
This person has a big empty fridge.

14:09.280 --> 14:10.240
It's empty.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.440
It's pizza-less.

14:11.440 --> 14:12.640
They've got a pizza shelf,

14:12.640 --> 14:14.000
a pizza crisper drawer.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.680
Also, listen, question asker.

14:15.680 --> 14:18.160
Can I just say, if you're working part-time

14:18.160 --> 14:19.680
and money is an issue,

14:19.680 --> 14:21.520
you could get like two pizzas

14:21.520 --> 14:23.920
for like $15 from Domino's.

14:23.920 --> 14:25.360
Get cheaper za.

14:25.360 --> 14:27.440
Why are you getting $40 pizza?

14:27.440 --> 14:29.360
Pizza Hut's got a carryout order

14:29.360 --> 14:30.960
for $10 any.

14:30.960 --> 14:31.760
Go with that.

14:31.760 --> 14:33.840
You can do 11 if you order due delivery.

14:33.840 --> 14:34.880
You only get one go-around.

14:34.880 --> 14:36.240
Eat the best pizza you can.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.840
That's my whole thing.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.520
That's sort of like what I'm all about.

14:39.520 --> 14:41.360
I realize that's a privileged position to take,

14:41.360 --> 14:42.560
but I think pizza's worth it.

14:44.640 --> 14:46.320
I mean, that is the best pizza that I could get.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.280
It is really good.

14:48.080 --> 14:50.560
That's sad for me in a major way.

14:51.680 --> 14:52.560
My name is Griffin,

14:52.560 --> 14:54.240
and I'm here to say that you should

14:54.240 --> 14:55.680
eat better pizza every day.

14:55.680 --> 15:00.320
Do you guys want a yahoo?

15:00.320 --> 15:00.640
Yes.

15:00.640 --> 15:03.040
I'm not done with this by a country mile.

15:03.040 --> 15:05.840
Well, it's cut and dry.

15:05.840 --> 15:06.320
It's cut and dry.

15:06.320 --> 15:07.440
This is fucking bullshit.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.880
If you bring something to somebody's house

15:09.520 --> 15:11.360
for all of you to consume,

15:11.360 --> 15:12.080
it's theirs.

15:12.080 --> 15:12.800
It's their house.

15:12.800 --> 15:13.280
It's theirs.

15:13.280 --> 15:13.920
It's their house.

15:13.920 --> 15:14.560
It's theirs.

15:14.560 --> 15:16.480
Stop fucking taking shit out of the house.

15:16.480 --> 15:17.440
This is easy.

15:17.440 --> 15:18.400
No, not unless.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.640
No, this is un-unlessable.

15:20.640 --> 15:21.440
There is unless.

15:21.440 --> 15:22.080
You're a criminal.

15:22.080 --> 15:22.560
You're a thief.

15:22.560 --> 15:24.720
You're the fucking pizza burglar.

15:24.720 --> 15:25.840
Rubble rubble, that's you.

15:25.840 --> 15:27.680
What if there's a precedent established

15:27.680 --> 15:29.200
and this question asker

15:29.200 --> 15:32.160
did something similar at this person's house?

15:32.160 --> 15:33.280
Two wrongs don't make a right.

15:34.320 --> 15:35.360
But three lefts do.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.040
Do you guys remember that Reliant K album?

15:37.680 --> 15:38.720
What about, okay,

15:38.720 --> 15:40.240
what if there were two pizzas,

15:40.240 --> 15:42.880
two extravagantly expensive pizzas ordered,

15:43.600 --> 15:46.080
but one was for each like,

15:47.120 --> 15:50.160
okay, what if one was specifically crafted

15:50.160 --> 15:52.560
by the person who stole the pizza?

15:52.560 --> 15:56.960
Like they incepted it with like their favorite olives

15:56.960 --> 15:58.960
and ham and turds or whatever,

15:58.960 --> 16:00.320
and it's just for them, right?

16:00.320 --> 16:02.640
They said like, just get me a tom.

16:02.640 --> 16:05.840
It's not beyond who paid for the pizza.

16:05.840 --> 16:06.960
Think about this for a second.

16:07.680 --> 16:09.280
Paying for the pizza is simple.

16:09.280 --> 16:10.720
Anybody could do that.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.000
What this person did

16:12.000 --> 16:14.560
is they looked at a huge list of ingredients

16:14.560 --> 16:16.960
and they opened up their third eye

16:16.960 --> 16:21.200
and they just like conceived of the perfect pizza for them.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.120
Like it's their creation at that point.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.720
Isn't there some ownership

16:24.720 --> 16:26.880
that they've been vested at that point?

16:28.880 --> 16:29.380
No.

16:31.600 --> 16:32.560
Yeah, how about Yahoo?

16:33.360 --> 16:37.760
Yeah, I'm just, it actually is a little disquieting

16:37.760 --> 16:41.920
that you basically just endorsed breaking and entering.

16:41.920 --> 16:44.000
That's what I'm upgrading it to, breaking and entering.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.560
I'm pretty pizza picky though,

16:46.560 --> 16:48.480
and I don't want people leaving pizza

16:48.480 --> 16:50.480
that has pineapple around.

16:50.480 --> 16:51.280
Like I don't want that.

16:51.280 --> 16:51.920
You can pick it off

16:51.920 --> 16:53.360
and then it's still got that good cheese on it.

16:53.360 --> 16:53.680
I don't want to fucking hear it.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.200
Now if they chipped in,

16:55.200 --> 16:59.120
if the person put in 20, is it then okay?

16:59.120 --> 17:01.680
Yeah, well still probably no, it's their house.

17:01.680 --> 17:03.680
I think there has to be a discussion.

17:03.680 --> 17:05.200
Like you're robbing someone

17:05.200 --> 17:07.680
of their most valuable natural resource.

17:07.680 --> 17:08.480
Not natural.

17:09.360 --> 17:12.880
Then you need to have a conversation about it regardless.

17:12.880 --> 17:15.040
I think you always have to have a discussion.

17:15.040 --> 17:16.160
Gonna be an uncomfortable discussion.

17:16.960 --> 17:17.920
We have to move on.

17:17.920 --> 17:18.800
I'm getting mad.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.320
Real super quick though.

17:20.320 --> 17:22.640
You want to reheat pizza just in a perfect fashion?

17:22.640 --> 17:23.600
Get a waffle iron.

17:23.600 --> 17:24.000
Oh yeah.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.760
Fold the pizza on half itself.

17:25.760 --> 17:28.800
You will be astounded at how good that is.

17:28.800 --> 17:31.280
And then bury it in the backyard for three weeks.

17:31.280 --> 17:33.520
Then dig it up when the time is right.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.240
Guess what?

17:34.240 --> 17:35.120
Now you've got kimchi.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.080
That's how kimchi is made.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.160
Do you guys know, I hate to break the flow,

17:40.160 --> 17:42.080
but I feel like we just haven't had a flow yet

17:42.080 --> 17:42.800
in this episode.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.320
So I want to get this in under the wire.

17:44.880 --> 17:46.240
Do you guys know about the Switch Witch?

17:47.440 --> 17:49.120
Okay, I saw this on Shark Tank.

17:49.120 --> 17:50.640
It pisses me off something fierce.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.400
Yeah, the Switch Witch.

17:52.400 --> 17:53.440
Do you know about it, Trav?

17:53.440 --> 17:54.080
No, I do not.

17:54.800 --> 17:58.560
We went to the drive-in yesterday to see Hocus Pocus

17:58.560 --> 18:00.240
and they did car-to-car trick-or-treat.

18:00.240 --> 18:00.960
It was really cute.

18:00.960 --> 18:02.880
Kids were coming car-to-car and trick-or-treating

18:02.880 --> 18:03.680
and it was great.

18:03.680 --> 18:06.160
I bought Mike and Ike's and Rachel hated that

18:06.160 --> 18:07.600
because I like Mike and Ike's and she thinks

18:07.600 --> 18:09.200
I'm the only person in the world that likes Mike and Ike's

18:09.200 --> 18:10.800
and so I just got candy that she knew.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.720
She knew that I got candy that only I liked

18:12.720 --> 18:14.880
so that if we didn't give all our candy away,

18:14.880 --> 18:16.960
I would have a bunch of Mike and Ike's and guess what?

18:16.960 --> 18:19.200
That is exact how it is, how it panned out.

18:19.840 --> 18:21.120
And the kids didn't seem so psyched

18:21.120 --> 18:22.240
about the Mike and Ike's anyway.

18:22.240 --> 18:25.360
Anyway, this mom came by and she had two kids,

18:25.360 --> 18:30.560
the two little kids and I gave them a bunch of Mike and Ike's

18:31.680 --> 18:35.360
and this boy actually stuck his hand into my giant bag

18:35.360 --> 18:37.760
of Mike and Ike mini-sized packages,

18:37.760 --> 18:38.960
pulled out like 20 bags.

18:38.960 --> 18:40.160
I was like, hell yeah.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.240
She was like, it's his first Halloween.

18:42.240 --> 18:43.440
I was like, he's a natural.

18:43.440 --> 18:44.560
He's very good at this.

18:44.560 --> 18:46.480
And she was like, well,

18:46.480 --> 18:47.840
it's all going to the Switch Witch anyway

18:47.840 --> 18:48.960
so it doesn't really matter.

18:48.960 --> 18:52.000
And I was like, well, I gotta Google that.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.840
You've said a thing that isn't a thing

18:53.840 --> 18:55.600
so let me just Google that real quick.

18:55.600 --> 18:56.880
And then when I found out what it was,

18:56.880 --> 18:58.400
I wanted to track her down and say,

18:58.400 --> 19:00.480
I'm gonna need you to give me that candy back

19:01.200 --> 19:04.080
because the Switch Witch is garbage.

19:04.080 --> 19:05.840
All right, Trav, what is it?

19:06.800 --> 19:07.760
It's like a shelf elf.

19:08.320 --> 19:09.760
It's like a shelf elf, right?

19:09.760 --> 19:10.960
A shelf.

19:10.960 --> 19:16.480
Switch Witch, you leave your hard-earned Halloween candy.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.800
You leave it for the Switch Witch, okay?

19:19.360 --> 19:21.760
In the end of the night,

19:21.760 --> 19:24.000
once the night's over and you wake up the next morning,

19:24.000 --> 19:26.560
your candy is gone and replaced with a present.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.800
But you get to decide how much candy you want to give up.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.680
The more candy you give up, the better present you get.

19:33.680 --> 19:36.720
There's an economy of scales to this.

19:36.720 --> 19:37.680
I hate this.

19:37.680 --> 19:38.080
I hate this.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.280
I hate it too.

19:39.280 --> 19:41.920
The family that was selling one of my Shark Tank said,

19:41.920 --> 19:43.440
we want to push this product

19:43.440 --> 19:46.640
so there's a Switch Witch in every house in America.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.400
And I just want to point out that, like,

19:48.960 --> 19:51.680
you do understand that we're not idiots, right?

19:51.680 --> 19:54.960
Like, the candy economy would definitely...

19:54.960 --> 19:58.400
Like, if everybody knew that you were taking their candy

19:58.400 --> 19:59.680
and throwing it in the trash

19:59.680 --> 20:01.520
because that's what everybody did

20:01.520 --> 20:03.360
and they fed it to some dumb witch,

20:03.360 --> 20:05.840
there's no way anybody's gonna hand out candy anymore.

20:05.840 --> 20:08.720
I am literally angry as a person who has bought

20:08.720 --> 20:10.960
and handed out candy with this idea of like,

20:10.960 --> 20:12.560
okay, and then we garbage it.

20:12.560 --> 20:15.280
A lot of that isn't even touching a kid mouth.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.040
I think about how much candy I handed out last night

20:17.040 --> 20:18.480
that's not even touching,

20:18.480 --> 20:21.440
not even crossing the sweet gums of a kid mouth.

20:21.440 --> 20:22.400
What? Why?

20:23.280 --> 20:23.760
No.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.120
What are we all doing here?

20:26.560 --> 20:29.520
This is as bad as burning an American flag with a menorah.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.720
I will not stand for it.

20:30.720 --> 20:32.400
This is worse.

20:32.400 --> 20:33.920
It's at least beside it.

20:33.920 --> 20:34.960
I did want to hit you guys.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.160
As long as we're talking about candy,

20:36.160 --> 20:38.640
like, we'll get back to the advice in a second.

20:38.640 --> 20:42.160
I had a weird Halloween and I need to unpack it

20:42.160 --> 20:42.960
is what I'm saying.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.000
I need to unpack mine.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.600
This is the first year that I took Charlie trick or treating

20:48.480 --> 20:52.160
and I wasn't struck with this problem

20:52.160 --> 20:53.600
until I started doing it

20:53.600 --> 20:57.120
and I'm curious like how you guys would have approached it.

20:57.120 --> 21:00.800
So I'm in the scenario where she definitely has a pumpkin

21:01.520 --> 21:03.200
and I definitely am.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.200
Well, first off, like I'm an adult man.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.600
I'm obviously carrying a few extra pounds

21:07.600 --> 21:10.480
and I'm carrying this baby around

21:10.480 --> 21:13.520
who can't say trick or treat or at least she won't.

21:13.520 --> 21:14.480
She can.

21:14.480 --> 21:15.440
She just won't.

21:15.440 --> 21:15.920
She won't.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.360
She's being very obstinate.

21:17.360 --> 21:18.240
Yeah, no kidding.

21:18.240 --> 21:21.600
She won't say thank you or bye or anything really.

21:21.600 --> 21:22.320
God.

21:22.320 --> 21:24.880
And she clearly can't eat candy.

21:24.880 --> 21:26.080
That is also true.

21:26.080 --> 21:26.800
Okay, yeah.

21:26.800 --> 21:28.480
But like I want to do,

21:28.480 --> 21:30.240
but it's like a fun thing, right?

21:30.240 --> 21:32.240
Just like you're walking around the neighborhood.

21:32.240 --> 21:34.240
So like I had two options.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.160
One is like I go up and I'm like,

21:36.160 --> 21:37.760
hey, give me some candy.

21:37.760 --> 21:38.400
Look at this.

21:38.400 --> 21:39.360
Look at this baby.

21:39.360 --> 21:41.360
Can I have some candy for my adult body?

21:41.360 --> 21:41.840
Thank you.

21:42.400 --> 21:43.920
And the other option-

21:43.920 --> 21:44.480
It's not for me.

21:44.480 --> 21:45.840
It's for the Switch Witch.

21:45.840 --> 21:47.120
It's for the Switch Witch, did you see?

21:47.120 --> 21:49.040
I'm hoping to get a new iPod.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.640
The other option I had though

21:50.640 --> 21:52.480
was to go to people's stores to be like,

21:52.480 --> 21:54.640
no thanks, I don't need any candy.

21:54.640 --> 21:55.760
It's just like, look.

21:55.760 --> 21:56.640
Look at this baby.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.240
You're just doing it for the XP.

21:58.240 --> 22:02.160
Apparently I'm just grinding my memories here with this baby.

22:03.440 --> 22:04.800
Mother fu-

22:04.800 --> 22:06.080
Okay, listen.

22:07.680 --> 22:08.000
Fuck.

22:08.560 --> 22:08.800
Fuck.

22:09.360 --> 22:10.000
Fuck though.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.520
Fuck though y'all for real though.

22:13.920 --> 22:14.880
Travis, tell them what happened

22:14.880 --> 22:17.200
because I'm too fucking angry.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.080
Here's what happened.

22:19.120 --> 22:22.320
My audacity for no goddamn reason

22:22.320 --> 22:24.320
stopped recording halfway through the episode.

22:24.320 --> 22:25.200
Pooped right in the bed.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.480
Got poop all over the sheets.

22:26.480 --> 22:27.760
The nice sheets.

22:27.760 --> 22:29.840
People ask us what programs we use to record

22:29.840 --> 22:30.880
and I always tell them audacity.

22:30.880 --> 22:32.560
Don't fucking use audacity for anything.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.320
No, it's free garbage.

22:34.320 --> 22:35.760
Free, that's why it's free

22:35.760 --> 22:36.560
because they left it on the floor.

22:36.560 --> 22:38.160
Anybody want this free garbage?

22:39.360 --> 22:41.360
It's like we're yelling into a toilet

22:41.360 --> 22:44.160
and praying to God that the toilet records our voices.

22:44.160 --> 22:46.560
The thing that hurts about it is that

22:47.680 --> 22:51.360
I feel that we are the earthly stewards

22:52.160 --> 22:55.680
of a divine talent.

22:55.680 --> 22:56.240
Yeah.

22:56.240 --> 22:59.440
And we have been bad stewards.

22:59.440 --> 23:03.040
We recorded, we used some of that gift

23:03.040 --> 23:05.760
to record half a fucking podcast.

23:05.760 --> 23:07.360
We spilled our seed on the ground.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.120
That's exactly it, Travis.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.680
We spilled our comedy seed on the soil

23:11.680 --> 23:13.760
down there with the snakes and rats.

23:13.760 --> 23:14.640
And now we're unclean.

23:15.440 --> 23:18.080
Ceremonially unclean.

23:19.200 --> 23:22.240
I don't have to do a whole smudging thing.

23:22.240 --> 23:26.400
So many good goofs that have just been consigned to oblivion.

23:26.400 --> 23:27.280
They're just lost now.

23:27.280 --> 23:27.920
They're just lost now.

23:27.920 --> 23:28.640
I remember them.

23:28.640 --> 23:29.760
I still get a good chuckle.

23:29.760 --> 23:34.400
Uh, should we just do a fresh 30?

23:35.280 --> 23:35.760
Yeah.

23:35.760 --> 23:36.880
Somebody's mowing their lawn now.

23:38.400 --> 23:39.520
Yesterday was better.

23:39.520 --> 23:41.520
Yesterday was a funnier comedy day.

23:41.520 --> 23:42.640
I have a cold now.

23:42.640 --> 23:44.240
I didn't have a cold yesterday.

23:44.240 --> 23:44.480
Yeah.

23:45.360 --> 23:45.600
Yeah.

23:46.560 --> 23:47.440
Well, let's just-

23:47.440 --> 23:48.800
This is gonna be, this one's gonna,

23:48.800 --> 23:51.520
the rest of the show's gonna be off the fucking rails.

23:51.520 --> 23:51.840
Yeah.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.120
And I hope you're all ready for it.

23:53.120 --> 23:53.840
Let's spin it up.

23:53.840 --> 23:56.160
I'm like, I'm barely hanging on.

23:56.160 --> 23:57.600
I got my key in the ignition.

23:57.600 --> 23:58.240
Let's twist it.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.880
Uh, this Yahoo was sent in by Tim Atkin.

24:00.880 --> 24:01.840
Thank you, Tim.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.360
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

24:04.240 --> 24:05.120
They're anonymous.

24:06.080 --> 24:08.960
Let's call them Pquad.

24:10.560 --> 24:11.680
Pquad asks,

24:13.040 --> 24:14.720
I will never learn a backflip.

24:15.840 --> 24:16.240
Hello.

24:17.280 --> 24:19.760
I'm trying to get over my fear of backflip.

24:19.760 --> 24:22.800
I'm trying to get over my fear of doing a backflip, but I can't.

24:22.800 --> 24:26.160
I saw over 100 videos on how to do a backflip.

24:26.160 --> 24:29.520
I can do a front flip pretty good, but I can't backflip.

24:29.520 --> 24:31.600
I got the part where you fall on your back

24:31.600 --> 24:33.440
and put your legs over your head.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.800
All of those, the wrong you-er.

24:38.160 --> 24:39.280
I do that good.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.040
I have done that a lot of times.

24:41.040 --> 24:43.680
I just don't have guts to do a backflip.

24:43.680 --> 24:47.520
I even have my mom as a spotter beside me, who I really trust,

24:47.520 --> 24:49.280
and I still can't do it.

24:49.280 --> 24:52.160
I jump, get ready, then I won't flip back.

24:52.720 --> 24:53.680
Any help, please.

24:53.680 --> 24:54.320
Thanks.

24:54.320 --> 24:57.600
I just want to start off by saying what a world in which we live

24:57.600 --> 25:01.680
that there's 100 videos available to our young people

25:01.680 --> 25:03.120
on how to do a backflip.

25:03.120 --> 25:05.680
Like what is not covered in the first one.

25:06.240 --> 25:06.560
Right.

25:06.560 --> 25:07.520
Yeah, right.

25:07.520 --> 25:10.240
The fact that there were 99 and somebody's like,

25:10.240 --> 25:12.640
nope, this is not instructive enough.

25:12.640 --> 25:15.280
No, I need a different angle.

25:15.280 --> 25:17.600
Oh, you're using the Bertolucci method.

25:17.600 --> 25:18.400
I see, I see.

25:19.120 --> 25:19.760
Fascinating.

25:19.760 --> 25:22.080
A little rote, perhaps.

25:22.080 --> 25:24.240
A little plebian.

25:24.240 --> 25:27.680
I also really enjoy the fact that, okay,

25:27.680 --> 25:30.000
so he's got the part where he falls backward

25:30.000 --> 25:31.520
and he puts his legs up, right?

25:32.080 --> 25:32.320
Yeah.

25:33.520 --> 25:37.040
His mom's got him perfected on that step.

25:37.040 --> 25:40.240
His mom's just like tighter, ankles in 15 degrees, perfect.

25:40.240 --> 25:41.840
Now next, you gotta have guts.

25:42.560 --> 25:45.840
So the only thing stopping him is not a physical problem.

25:46.400 --> 25:46.640
No.

25:46.640 --> 25:49.920
It's that there's a mental block in his brain

25:49.920 --> 25:54.400
that will not let him do a sweet 360 backflip.

25:54.400 --> 25:56.400
I think it's just your inner ear, right?

25:56.400 --> 25:56.640
Yeah.

25:57.280 --> 26:01.120
It's your cochlear defense mechanism

26:01.120 --> 26:02.640
triggering and telling you, hey, don't do that.

26:02.640 --> 26:03.440
Hey, stop it.

26:04.240 --> 26:06.080
Stop doing that.

26:06.080 --> 26:08.320
I see where this person is coming from because,

26:09.120 --> 26:10.160
okay, so they can flip.

26:10.160 --> 26:13.040
You gotta remember, Trev, that they are flipping

26:13.040 --> 26:15.120
and landing on their back good.

26:15.120 --> 26:15.600
Yeah.

26:15.600 --> 26:22.800
They want to be on their feet after having done a 360 degree rotation, right?

26:22.800 --> 26:26.480
So right now, they're getting to about 180.

26:26.480 --> 26:27.120
Yeah.

26:27.120 --> 26:32.080
There are still many degrees of just paralysis.

26:32.080 --> 26:32.480
Yeah, sure.

26:32.480 --> 26:35.520
Just complete and total like incident

26:35.520 --> 26:38.080
that they have to like clear in one pass.

26:38.080 --> 26:40.880
But Justin, mom's not gonna let that happen.

26:40.880 --> 26:42.640
That's why he's got his mom there.

26:42.640 --> 26:45.840
You can't practice the part where you land butter side down.

26:48.480 --> 26:49.200
You're dead.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.040
Like dead ski dead 100%.

26:51.040 --> 26:51.760
Welcome to heaven.

26:51.760 --> 26:52.720
How far did you get?

26:52.720 --> 26:53.920
About 270.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.760
That's the worst one you could do.

26:57.760 --> 27:00.160
I gotta tell you, man, if you'd made at least 280,

27:00.160 --> 27:01.600
I think you would have been all right.

27:01.600 --> 27:03.360
I mean, 270 is the worst.

27:04.160 --> 27:07.520
You went full 6 p.m. and you can't do that, dog.

27:07.520 --> 27:09.440
Now, can I get back to midnight?

27:10.080 --> 27:12.000
You landed right on your C6.

27:12.000 --> 27:12.720
Damn, son.

27:12.720 --> 27:14.320
That's a bad one to hit.

27:14.320 --> 27:15.120
That's a rough one.

27:15.120 --> 27:16.480
It's one of the best ones I made.

27:16.480 --> 27:17.040
I made that one.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.000
That's what I call that one.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.360
The paralysis bone.

27:19.360 --> 27:20.960
You gotta watch out for that one.

27:20.960 --> 27:21.920
Tricky bone.

27:21.920 --> 27:22.800
Tricky, tricky bone.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.320
How to give humans a weak point, you see?

27:25.680 --> 27:26.160
That was it.

27:26.160 --> 27:27.200
That's the only one.

27:27.200 --> 27:30.160
How does anyone learn about like who did the first backflip?

27:31.280 --> 27:33.200
That's a good question, Travis.

27:33.200 --> 27:34.160
Yeah, that is good.

27:34.160 --> 27:35.760
The answer is Ben Vereen.

27:37.840 --> 27:40.720
So it was probably like 1977 and Ben Vereen did it.

27:40.720 --> 27:42.880
And people were like, what?

27:42.880 --> 27:44.160
How much coke did I take?

27:44.880 --> 27:46.080
Excuse me?

27:46.080 --> 27:46.640
Sorry?

27:48.880 --> 27:51.040
Even Ben Vereen didn't know what had just happened.

27:51.040 --> 27:54.960
Like he was trying to do a front flip and like just did it backwards.

27:54.960 --> 27:56.160
Yeah, yeah.

27:56.160 --> 27:56.880
Well, he was drunk.

27:57.840 --> 28:00.560
Classic drunk Ben Vereen did a backflip.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.560
I shouldn't have done that, he said.

28:03.520 --> 28:05.040
He tore a hole in the universe.

28:05.040 --> 28:06.640
Have you guys ever done a backflip?

28:06.640 --> 28:08.400
Yeah, I did one today, earlier today.

28:08.400 --> 28:12.080
I woke up and did my pee, my morning pee.

28:12.080 --> 28:13.440
I did a flip off the toilet.

28:14.880 --> 28:17.040
No, I've never done a fucking backflip.

28:17.760 --> 28:20.320
I'm just curious if you guys have ever done a backflip before.

28:20.320 --> 28:22.080
I don't know if I've done any flip.

28:22.080 --> 28:23.440
I think I've done a somersault.

28:23.440 --> 28:24.880
That's the one where you just roll on the ground the whole time.

28:24.880 --> 28:27.760
I don't even like doing somersaults because your butt hits the ground really hard.

28:27.760 --> 28:29.520
And it's close to C6 territory.

28:29.520 --> 28:33.440
It's not flipping and rolling, it's just not my speed.

28:33.440 --> 28:34.560
You gotta wonk at it.

28:34.560 --> 28:36.320
You gotta roll and then pop up.

28:36.960 --> 28:37.600
Yeah.

28:37.600 --> 28:40.480
But if I was that agile, I'd be doing backflips every day.

28:40.480 --> 28:41.040
Well, yeah.

28:42.240 --> 28:44.720
Maybe they need an impetus, right?

28:44.720 --> 28:49.280
You have no biological need to do a backflip, right?

28:50.080 --> 28:57.520
Maybe they need some sort of threat that they have to not get hit by

28:57.520 --> 28:59.680
and that necessitates a backflip.

28:59.680 --> 29:03.280
Oh, so like a blade coming at your knees?

29:03.280 --> 29:04.800
Blade, the vampire blade?

29:04.800 --> 29:10.960
Like, you know how your dad pushes you in the pool and then you learn to swim?

29:10.960 --> 29:11.360
Yeah.

29:11.360 --> 29:12.960
What is that for backflips?

29:14.720 --> 29:15.600
But this is what I'm saying.

29:15.600 --> 29:19.600
Like, I don't think there is a need for backflips.

29:20.400 --> 29:23.920
I don't think that there is any problem that can only be solved by backflip.

29:23.920 --> 29:26.640
Well, say that, but then you watch Ocean's Eleven.

29:27.440 --> 29:28.400
Oh, right, that too.

29:28.400 --> 29:34.960
Um, maybe this person's mom is giving them bad instructions

29:36.080 --> 29:39.040
trying to keep them from doing more backflips.

29:39.040 --> 29:40.320
Like, they're nagging them.

29:40.320 --> 29:44.320
Right, it's the most dangerous, it's the most dangerous game is backflips.

29:44.320 --> 29:46.400
And so the mom is like, yep, no, you did it.

29:46.400 --> 29:47.440
You just did one.

29:47.440 --> 29:48.400
That was a good one right there.

29:48.400 --> 29:49.440
That was one right there.

29:49.440 --> 29:51.440
You did, no, that was a backflip.

29:52.240 --> 29:53.040
That was a backflip.

29:53.040 --> 29:56.080
You just laid on your back and you put your legs up in the air and you kicked them.

29:56.080 --> 29:56.800
That was good.

29:56.800 --> 30:00.640
Have y'all ever seen somebody really beef a backflip?

30:01.200 --> 30:02.640
It's terrifying.

30:02.640 --> 30:03.440
It's the worst.

30:03.440 --> 30:04.720
It's a very bad scene.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.360
It makes people, like, no matter what age or...

30:08.080 --> 30:11.040
Everybody comes together for the fear of that person's back.

30:11.040 --> 30:13.440
When we were in middle element, was it elementary school or middle school?

30:13.440 --> 30:14.960
It was at Miller Elementary, boy.

30:15.840 --> 30:17.200
Go Owls?

30:17.920 --> 30:20.080
Go Owls, the most terrifying.

30:20.720 --> 30:24.240
Somebody there knew the Red Ranger from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.

30:24.240 --> 30:28.320
It was like an associate producer's daughter or something like that.

30:28.320 --> 30:32.480
And so he came to the school to tell us all about how drugs were banned.

30:33.120 --> 30:38.640
And then he attempted to do a backflip off of the stage and beefed it so hard.

30:38.640 --> 30:41.200
He was so coke high, which is the ironic thing.

30:41.200 --> 30:42.480
He was so coke high.

30:42.480 --> 30:43.920
He actually did a 540.

30:45.680 --> 30:49.600
He landed on a C5 and I was like, oh, close one, Austin.

30:49.600 --> 30:50.800
It was Austin St. John.

30:50.800 --> 30:55.120
Can you not spread, like, fucking vicious rumors about Austin St. John's drug use?

30:55.120 --> 30:55.680
No, you're right.

30:55.680 --> 30:56.960
He's clean.

30:57.920 --> 31:01.120
It was just karate energy that gave him the extra flipping strength.

31:01.120 --> 31:05.600
But I remember, like, I was, like, nine years old and I was like, oh, that's bad.

31:05.600 --> 31:06.400
He might...

31:06.400 --> 31:07.040
He'll never...

31:07.040 --> 31:08.720
He's certainly not gonna flip again.

31:08.720 --> 31:10.880
Certainly not gonna pilot Megazord again.

31:10.880 --> 31:11.920
That's definitely true.

31:11.920 --> 31:14.000
Do you guys think...

31:14.000 --> 31:16.560
I have a question for you about your elementary school years.

31:16.560 --> 31:21.520
Did the landscape change in terms of, like, what lies...

31:21.520 --> 31:22.080
Okay.

31:22.080 --> 31:26.480
When you're in elementary school and you're out on the playground, kids lie constantly, right?

31:26.480 --> 31:27.840
I got a Canadian girlfriend.

31:27.840 --> 31:29.600
I got an uncle who works at Nintendo.

31:29.600 --> 31:30.800
I'm good at basketball.

31:30.800 --> 31:31.760
I'm good at basketball.

31:31.760 --> 31:33.600
My dad knows the Red Ranger.

31:33.600 --> 31:34.560
I'm the king of Spain.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.400
I've switched places with a pauper.

31:36.400 --> 31:42.800
When that girl actually managed to materialize the Red Ranger, that must have changed the

31:42.800 --> 31:45.280
whole game in terms of lying out there.

31:45.280 --> 31:46.080
It was pretty sick.

31:46.080 --> 31:51.360
But then that excitement was short-lived because I watched him absolutely chomp a flipper.

31:51.920 --> 31:53.360
Just absolutely chomp a beef.

31:53.360 --> 31:54.960
And then that little girl ran up to him.

31:54.960 --> 31:56.000
You embarrassed me, Austin St. John!

31:56.000 --> 31:57.760
You embarrassed me, Austin St. John.

31:58.720 --> 32:00.000
No, no, Power Ranger.

32:01.440 --> 32:02.160
I like that.

32:03.120 --> 32:08.880
He set up a foundation to help fix Austin St. John and it's time to raise some money for it.

32:08.880 --> 32:11.200
Please teach Austin St. John how to flip good.

32:12.160 --> 32:13.760
He doesn't have the confidence.

32:13.760 --> 32:18.960
Can you imagine if you beef a flipper in front of like 47-year-olds?

32:20.320 --> 32:21.280
You'll never flip again.

32:21.280 --> 32:22.880
That's the ultimate shame.

32:22.880 --> 32:24.800
Ironically, you know who's really forgiving?

32:24.800 --> 32:26.080
47-year-olds.

32:26.080 --> 32:26.480
You know what?

32:27.440 --> 32:32.560
I had three near-simultaneous thoughts of, man, I hope Austin St. John doesn't listen to this.

32:32.560 --> 32:35.600
And then, oh man, there's no way Austin St. John remembers this.

32:35.600 --> 32:40.480
And then, yeah, he bet he totally does remember this.

32:40.480 --> 32:42.640
Austin, what would you like to talk about in today's session?

32:42.640 --> 32:43.600
The backflip again.

32:43.600 --> 32:44.960
Again, Austin?

32:44.960 --> 32:48.400
Again, I thought we had such a breakthrough last time when you just laid on your back

32:48.400 --> 32:49.520
and you kicked your feet up.

32:49.520 --> 32:50.020
Yeah.

32:51.040 --> 32:51.840
Thanks, Mom.

32:51.840 --> 32:53.200
I got super duper close.

32:53.200 --> 32:54.400
Stick to kipups, Austin.

32:54.400 --> 32:55.440
Okay, here we go.

32:55.440 --> 32:58.560
Let's raise some money for Austin St. John in the Money Zone.

32:58.560 --> 33:13.600
Our first sponsor this week is Naturebox.com.

33:13.600 --> 33:18.240
Well, I guess they just prefer Naturebox, but they don't normally put the...

33:18.240 --> 33:23.680
Anyway, they have a ton of great snacks like peanut butter nom-noms and sriracha cashews.

33:23.680 --> 33:25.520
I like the mini Belgian waffles.

33:25.520 --> 33:26.560
Boy, those are nice.

33:26.560 --> 33:30.960
Just like a little spot of natural peanut butter goes down real good.

33:31.680 --> 33:33.920
Also, just smother them in chocolate.

33:33.920 --> 33:34.640
Sure.

33:34.640 --> 33:36.320
Nutella, pretty much any liquid.

33:36.960 --> 33:39.440
I like their bacon uh-ohs.

33:40.240 --> 33:41.680
That's not a real one.

33:41.680 --> 33:44.720
Yeah, bacon, you haven't had the bacon uh-ohs?

33:44.720 --> 33:47.440
At least brand new choices every single month.

33:48.640 --> 33:51.360
Naturebox is full of flavor, but without any of the junk.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.400
So here's the deal.

33:52.400 --> 33:58.640
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother and you can unbox a world of taste and possibility.

33:59.680 --> 34:02.160
I really like their salt promises.

34:02.160 --> 34:03.120
Have you guys had those?

34:03.120 --> 34:04.560
Again, not real?

34:04.560 --> 34:05.680
No, no, no, those are...

34:05.680 --> 34:07.840
I was kidding about bacon uh-ohs, but salt promises.

34:07.840 --> 34:08.400
That's like a...

34:08.400 --> 34:12.000
They're like little salty promises.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.800
Griffin, have you tried the Melting Susans?

34:14.800 --> 34:16.400
I have not tried the Melting Susans.

34:17.680 --> 34:19.520
You gotta do it quick or they're gone.

34:19.520 --> 34:24.640
Yeah, I really like caramel and there's a question mark at the end of it.

34:25.760 --> 34:28.320
I like the salted peppermint missed connections.

34:28.320 --> 34:30.000
Yeah, those are very good.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.840
Naturebox.com slash my brother.

34:31.840 --> 34:35.600
Find out which of these are real and which are fake and get your first box of hand-picked

34:35.600 --> 34:37.840
snacks sent direct to your doorstep.

34:37.840 --> 34:39.280
I want to tell you guys about Zip Recruiter.

34:41.280 --> 34:46.960
Zip Recruiter is a place where you can recruit millions of people to work at a single business,

34:46.960 --> 34:47.460
I think.

34:47.460 --> 34:49.220
No, wait, no.

34:50.180 --> 34:51.060
That's a crazy business.

34:51.060 --> 34:54.580
Have you ever wanted to have millions of employees in your small business?

34:54.580 --> 34:55.780
Raise your own army.

34:57.540 --> 34:59.380
Zip Recruiter is an army recruitment...

34:59.380 --> 35:04.100
No, if you're short staffed, there's no time to deal with the dozens of different job sites

35:04.100 --> 35:04.740
that are out there.

35:04.740 --> 35:08.820
Monster, cooljobs.fart, was that what it was?

35:11.620 --> 35:16.100
With Zip Recruiter, you can post to 100 plus job sites with a single click and be instantly

35:16.100 --> 35:20.020
matched to candidates from over 6 million resumes.

35:20.020 --> 35:21.540
You can hire all 6 million if you want.

35:21.540 --> 35:23.060
I'm not going to tell you what to do.

35:23.060 --> 35:27.060
Zip Recruiter has been used by over 400,000 businesses and you can try it right now for

35:27.060 --> 35:27.300
free.

35:27.300 --> 35:29.860
Go to ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

35:29.860 --> 35:32.900
That's ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

35:32.900 --> 35:34.500
Start surfing the human web.

35:36.740 --> 35:41.700
I got a message for Tom and Jessica from Ashley Shannon and this is the entire message.

35:42.340 --> 35:43.300
Hey guys, call me back.

35:43.300 --> 35:46.660
All right, is that for us or?

35:46.660 --> 35:47.220
No, it wasn't.

35:48.020 --> 35:53.860
I also just want everyone to know that this was a best available time slot.

35:54.500 --> 35:57.620
So God knows how long Ashley has been waiting for this call.

35:58.900 --> 36:02.340
She could be like a cartoon skeleton with cobwebs by this point.

36:02.340 --> 36:07.380
She probably is because I bet she got locked out of her refrigerator and she couldn't eat

36:07.380 --> 36:09.700
any food and now she's a cobweb skeleton.

36:09.700 --> 36:13.780
Tom's like, hey Jessica, do you remember an Ashley Shannon?

36:15.060 --> 36:16.500
Do you remember Ashley Shannon?

36:17.380 --> 36:18.740
She's all bones now.

36:18.740 --> 36:23.700
We make the Pony Express look like Prodigy or CompuServe.

36:25.700 --> 36:29.300
I have another message here and it's from Sarah and it's to Jesse.

36:30.100 --> 36:32.900
And Sarah says to Jesse, hey Jesse, Jesse!

36:34.820 --> 36:38.660
I wanted to wish you a happy birthday in Truman Bim Bam style since you were sweet enough to

36:38.660 --> 36:40.340
do the same for me on my birthday.

36:40.340 --> 36:42.260
I love you more than anything else in the world.

36:42.260 --> 36:43.300
You better get ready.

36:43.300 --> 36:49.620
I'll bring the love and you bring the powerade so we can replenish ourselves after we do

36:49.620 --> 36:50.660
activities together.

36:51.460 --> 36:53.700
You know, like they're playing some ultimate.

36:54.260 --> 36:54.900
Oh, okay.

36:54.900 --> 36:56.740
Ooh, I thought you meant boning.

36:56.740 --> 36:58.260
Travis, Patrick McElroy.

36:58.820 --> 36:59.860
Yes Griffin Andrew?

37:00.420 --> 37:01.220
What?

37:01.220 --> 37:03.540
We just said fuck like 18 times.

37:03.540 --> 37:05.940
Well, that's because we lost a fucking recording.

37:05.940 --> 37:07.220
That fucking sucks.

37:07.220 --> 37:08.100
That was out of anger.

37:08.100 --> 37:09.140
That's not profanity.

37:09.140 --> 37:11.220
But we can't talk about fucking out of love.

37:11.220 --> 37:12.180
No Travis.

37:13.060 --> 37:14.260
Can I say lovemaking?

37:16.420 --> 37:18.020
In many ways that's worse.

37:18.660 --> 37:21.620
They need the powerade to replenish our fluids after lovemaking.

37:24.580 --> 37:26.260
The sweet embrace of coitus.

37:26.900 --> 37:27.380
We're eight.

37:27.940 --> 37:31.060
Do you think Austin St. John makes love or does he just fuck?

37:31.060 --> 37:41.220
Can you imagine having that his mouth just inches away from your ear and he whispers?

37:42.020 --> 37:43.220
It's morphin time.

37:43.220 --> 37:43.460
Yeah.

37:45.060 --> 37:46.580
I'm gonna morph inside you.

37:46.580 --> 37:47.220
What?

37:47.220 --> 37:47.620
Austin?

37:48.660 --> 37:49.380
Austin, no.

37:50.580 --> 37:51.460
It's porkin time.

37:54.020 --> 37:55.380
Let's move on with our lives.

37:55.380 --> 37:56.980
What if Zordon, what do you think?

37:57.860 --> 37:58.900
I've got a Zordon.

37:58.900 --> 38:00.580
I've got a raging Zordon.

38:05.700 --> 38:06.820
I hate this shit.

38:06.820 --> 38:09.140
See, if that wasn't in the one we lost.

38:11.060 --> 38:14.020
Ty is a pedantic person.

38:14.020 --> 38:18.420
I think when he pronounces these words, it's in a very show-offy way.

38:18.900 --> 38:19.700
Jairo.

38:19.700 --> 38:20.660
Yiro.

38:20.660 --> 38:21.620
Sacrebleu.

38:21.620 --> 38:22.660
Sacrebleu.

38:22.660 --> 38:23.700
Ayers Rock.

38:23.700 --> 38:24.260
Uluru.

38:24.260 --> 38:30.260
What you are witnessing is real.

38:30.260 --> 38:32.420
The participants are not actors.

38:32.420 --> 38:34.900
They are actual litigants with real cases.

38:35.460 --> 38:41.300
They call in via Skype to Judge John Hodgman's court, the real people's court.

38:41.300 --> 38:44.900
Now I call you to Judge John Hodgman's internet court.

38:44.900 --> 38:49.140
Find it at Maximumfun.org or wherever you download podcasts.

38:49.940 --> 38:53.140
I recently referred my friend to work at the same company as me

38:53.140 --> 38:59.540
and he got the job, which I just found out comes with a nice $1,500 bonus before taxes.

38:59.540 --> 39:02.900
He recently messaged me and said he thinks he should get a chunk of it.

39:02.900 --> 39:03.860
What the fuck?

39:04.420 --> 39:05.780
He is a single guy.

39:05.780 --> 39:08.020
I have a wife, two kids, and a mortgage to pay.

39:08.020 --> 39:08.740
Not relevant.

39:09.380 --> 39:10.340
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

39:11.060 --> 39:12.660
You could be a coke dealer.

39:12.660 --> 39:14.820
I told him no, but in a nice way.

39:14.820 --> 39:17.860
After all, we're only a few weeks away from buying candlelight presents

39:17.860 --> 39:19.620
and also diapers are expensive.

39:19.620 --> 39:23.220
Do I owe it to him to toss him a few bucks since I don't technically earn it?

39:23.780 --> 39:25.860
Or is getting him the new job good enough?

39:25.860 --> 39:26.900
Am I good?

39:26.900 --> 39:28.340
That's from All Mine in Atlanta.

39:28.340 --> 39:31.700
This is insanity.

39:33.060 --> 39:34.980
The fact that you're trying to justify it to us like,

39:34.980 --> 39:36.500
I have kids and I have to buy diapers.

39:37.940 --> 39:39.220
That's great and all, doesn't matter.

39:39.220 --> 39:42.420
I don't care if you said I'm gonna take that $1,500 and burn it.

39:43.060 --> 39:48.660
I'm allergic to money and if I touch it, I get very, very ill.

39:48.660 --> 39:49.860
I don't give a shit.

39:49.860 --> 39:51.060
It's your fungibles.

39:52.180 --> 39:54.500
His bonus is a paycheck.

39:54.500 --> 39:58.020
It's a paycheck that you got him in the bank every two weeks, homie.

39:58.740 --> 39:59.540
What are you talking about?

39:59.540 --> 40:01.060
Do you get a cut of that?

40:01.060 --> 40:06.820
Do you give him like $500 now and then you get 10% of his paycheck every like month?

40:06.820 --> 40:08.820
You need a royalty on this deal.

40:09.460 --> 40:12.100
Gotta get that, gotta get your long straw out.

40:12.100 --> 40:14.900
You gotta sip, you gotta sip of that juice.

40:14.900 --> 40:15.860
Is it possible?

40:15.860 --> 40:21.940
Is it possible after like the pizza thing and then this thing that like people just don't have-

40:21.940 --> 40:23.540
The society is just grumbling around us?

40:23.540 --> 40:29.140
Yeah, like friendship is just not what it was anymore because I cannot imagine,

40:29.140 --> 40:33.380
even like my closest friend who I have no problem saying like whatever to.

40:33.380 --> 40:34.660
I can say anything to them.

40:34.660 --> 40:37.620
The idea of being like, but I need some of your money.

40:38.340 --> 40:41.780
Like, no, no, ew, ow.

40:41.780 --> 40:43.380
This is bonkers and bad.

40:43.380 --> 40:47.060
I think you and should break up with this friend and pizza,

40:47.060 --> 40:49.620
would sure would like some pizza in Truett Park, break up with their friend.

40:49.620 --> 40:53.620
You're each other's friends now and the other two friends can just fucking parasite off each other

40:53.620 --> 40:56.580
until they run out of money or pizza and just wither up and die.

40:58.580 --> 40:59.300
Unless.

40:59.300 --> 41:00.820
Unless.

41:01.700 --> 41:03.060
Check that calendar again.

41:04.180 --> 41:05.540
What year is it?

41:05.540 --> 41:07.140
Well, it's November 2nd now.

41:07.140 --> 41:08.660
Yeah, but what year is it?

41:09.700 --> 41:10.500
2015.

41:11.220 --> 41:13.140
Sorry, did you just say 2015?

41:13.140 --> 41:17.220
Sorry, do you mean 20-grifteen colon the con is on?

41:17.220 --> 41:18.420
The con is still on, yeah.

41:18.980 --> 41:21.620
The con is on.

41:21.620 --> 41:24.260
Is it off on January 1, 16?

41:24.260 --> 41:24.500
Yeah.

41:26.100 --> 41:27.300
Then the apologies begin.

41:27.300 --> 41:28.900
Got about 58 days.

41:28.900 --> 41:32.100
So start, keep your conning, finish those cons up.

41:32.100 --> 41:33.940
It's time to move on to the fucking prestige.

41:36.100 --> 41:39.780
So what if this, okay, you get your friend a job.

41:39.780 --> 41:39.940
Yeah.

41:39.940 --> 41:43.460
Yeah, 750 in your pocket, 750 in his pocket.

41:43.460 --> 41:43.780
Garbage.

41:43.780 --> 41:44.420
He quits.

41:44.980 --> 41:45.700
Okay.

41:45.700 --> 41:46.900
How long does he have the job?

41:47.460 --> 41:47.860
What?

41:47.860 --> 41:49.460
How long does he have to keep the job?

41:49.460 --> 41:50.340
It doesn't matter.

41:50.340 --> 41:51.140
A day.

41:51.140 --> 41:53.620
I mean, he literally, he like calls in the next day.

41:53.620 --> 41:54.660
He's like, hey, it's Brian.

41:54.660 --> 41:55.860
I got hit by a bus, bye.

41:56.660 --> 41:57.460
And he's just gone.

41:57.460 --> 41:58.180
I'm an angel now.

41:58.180 --> 42:00.500
I'm calling you on an angel phone.

42:00.500 --> 42:01.860
Then you show up.

42:01.860 --> 42:02.900
He's back.

42:02.900 --> 42:04.020
Fake mustache.

42:04.020 --> 42:05.860
This is my friend, Ryan.

42:05.860 --> 42:08.820
He is in many ways more qualified than Brian.

42:08.820 --> 42:11.220
So far, so good.

42:11.220 --> 42:15.540
I don't want to speak ill of the dead, but fuck Brian's whole work ethic.

42:15.540 --> 42:18.980
Brian gets the job, 750 in your pocket.

42:18.980 --> 42:22.420
Next day, you overhear a little chatter around the coffee maker.

42:22.420 --> 42:24.580
Did you hear the tragic news?

42:25.140 --> 42:28.100
Ryan moved to Aruba and was hit by a bus.

42:29.300 --> 42:30.580
That's probably a little more fiction.

42:30.580 --> 42:31.460
Hi, everybody.

42:31.460 --> 42:32.980
This is president Obama.

42:32.980 --> 42:37.060
I'm prioritizing legislation to just get rid of buses.

42:37.060 --> 42:38.420
They're fucking out of control.

42:38.420 --> 42:39.460
They're out of control.

42:39.460 --> 42:40.580
Did you see Ghost Dad?

42:42.500 --> 42:45.940
Then who's that knocking on the door the next day?

42:45.940 --> 42:48.580
Boss checks his day planner.

42:48.580 --> 42:49.140
What's that?

42:50.180 --> 42:54.100
I have a 1030 with a new hire applicant named Brian.

42:54.660 --> 42:55.860
Can that be right?

42:55.860 --> 42:56.740
It can.

42:56.740 --> 43:00.420
And guess who's about to make 750 more dollars?

43:00.420 --> 43:00.980
It's you.

43:00.980 --> 43:01.940
The con is on.

43:01.940 --> 43:02.660
Also, Brian.

43:03.860 --> 43:04.500
Next day.

43:04.500 --> 43:05.380
You and Brian.

43:05.380 --> 43:06.500
Next day, Brian.

43:06.500 --> 43:07.220
Hit by a bus.

43:07.220 --> 43:08.500
Brian's not even a name.

43:09.060 --> 43:10.420
I'm gonna miss him, though.

43:10.420 --> 43:11.620
This is my friend, Scryin.

43:13.300 --> 43:14.500
He's had a lot of work.

43:15.060 --> 43:16.420
He's really into seeing the future.

43:16.420 --> 43:17.380
Yeah, he's a soothsayer.

43:17.940 --> 43:19.380
This is a lot of work.

43:19.380 --> 43:21.140
Didn't foresee that bus, though.

43:21.140 --> 43:21.860
Because he's dead.

43:21.860 --> 43:22.740
750 more.

43:22.740 --> 43:23.700
This is Dryin.

43:23.700 --> 43:24.200
Dryin?

43:24.980 --> 43:25.540
Dryin?

43:25.540 --> 43:26.180
Travis, you're right.

43:26.180 --> 43:28.580
It is a lot of work, and that's why we got to simplify the process.

43:28.580 --> 43:31.860
Cut Dryin, Brian, Dryin, Ryan out completely.

43:31.860 --> 43:33.140
It's just you.

43:33.140 --> 43:33.780
Okay.

43:33.780 --> 43:35.940
Okay, you show up at work.

43:35.940 --> 43:37.620
Hey, boss, it's Doug.

43:37.620 --> 43:39.780
I've got another great candidate for you.

43:39.780 --> 43:40.740
His name is Jug.

43:43.220 --> 43:43.860
It's you.

43:43.860 --> 43:45.540
You're in a bowler cap and a monocle.

43:45.540 --> 43:46.100
Good day.

43:46.100 --> 43:47.060
Good day.

43:47.060 --> 43:48.260
Yes, I am Jug.

43:48.820 --> 43:49.620
I'm Jug.

43:49.620 --> 43:51.860
I'm prepared to work at your establishment.

43:51.860 --> 43:53.380
I will work hard.

43:53.380 --> 43:54.660
I will do good jobs.

43:55.620 --> 43:58.580
Can you just be like, yeah, I've got a candidate.

43:58.580 --> 43:59.780
It's you, boss man.

43:59.780 --> 44:00.740
You're hired.

44:00.740 --> 44:02.100
I'm hiring you for your job.

44:02.100 --> 44:03.620
That'll be $1,500.

44:03.620 --> 44:04.660
Money, please.

44:04.660 --> 44:05.380
Money, please.

44:05.380 --> 44:07.620
I'll take it in small or large bills.

44:07.620 --> 44:09.140
You know who else we should hire?

44:09.140 --> 44:10.580
Debra from accounting.

44:11.620 --> 44:12.580
Bring Debra in here.

44:12.580 --> 44:13.540
Debra, good news.

44:13.540 --> 44:14.900
I'm hiring you for your job.

44:14.900 --> 44:16.260
Well, yeah, I already work.

44:16.260 --> 44:17.300
You're perfect then.

44:17.300 --> 44:18.260
A perfect candidate.

44:18.260 --> 44:19.220
Very qualified.

44:20.180 --> 44:20.580
I don't know.

44:20.580 --> 44:21.620
This still seems exact.

44:21.620 --> 44:22.660
Can I just embezzle?

44:23.300 --> 44:25.300
Yeah, just embezzle.

44:25.300 --> 44:25.780
Or just steal.

44:25.780 --> 44:27.700
It just seems much more straightforward.

44:27.700 --> 44:28.900
Just steal.

44:28.900 --> 44:29.460
Just take.

44:30.020 --> 44:31.140
Can I just steal?

44:32.420 --> 44:33.700
Just steal and take.

44:33.700 --> 44:36.100
And don't try and get clever about it because that's how you get caught.

44:36.100 --> 44:37.540
Just fucking take.

44:38.100 --> 44:39.540
Yeah, just take.

44:40.180 --> 44:42.420
Because everybody assumes nobody's stealing.

44:42.420 --> 44:43.140
Yeah, but everyone-

44:43.140 --> 44:47.060
Unless you yourself are a stealer, in which case you're assuming everybody is all the time.

44:47.060 --> 44:48.340
This is the secret.

44:48.340 --> 44:50.340
Everyone's stealing all the time.

44:51.540 --> 44:53.460
I steal from this podcast a bunch.

44:54.340 --> 44:56.020
What do you steal from this podcast?

44:56.580 --> 44:58.500
I stole 30 Minutes Trash's recording.

44:58.500 --> 45:00.500
It's me, podcast Krampus.

45:01.220 --> 45:02.820
I've cursed Audacity.

45:02.820 --> 45:03.700
Just kidding.

45:03.700 --> 45:07.940
But we cut your head off and buried you in a grave and put a cross up and set a fire around it.

45:07.940 --> 45:10.100
Yeah, it takes two crosses.

45:10.820 --> 45:11.300
Damn it.

45:11.300 --> 45:12.260
You can't kill podcast Krampus.

45:12.260 --> 45:15.140
I told you, Travis, we shouldn't have gotten cheap on the crosses.

45:15.860 --> 45:17.300
Well, you know, ties are tight.

45:17.300 --> 45:18.020
It's candlelight.

45:18.020 --> 45:19.300
There's not a lot of money to go around.

45:19.300 --> 45:21.460
Also, you used Epsom salt.

45:21.460 --> 45:25.220
It takes kosher if you want to take down old podcast Krampus.

45:26.260 --> 45:28.740
That's what I had left over from my gout.

45:29.940 --> 45:30.420
Sorry?

45:30.420 --> 45:32.740
You heard me, Krampus.

45:32.740 --> 45:34.500
No, I heard the words you said.

45:35.700 --> 45:39.060
They didn't make sense since you have to put salt on your gout.

45:40.100 --> 45:40.980
You gotta soak it.

45:40.980 --> 45:41.860
Come on, Krampus.

45:41.860 --> 45:42.820
Read a book.

45:42.820 --> 45:44.740
100% certain what gout is.

45:44.740 --> 45:46.580
And I'm pretty sure I did a salt buns episode about it.

45:46.580 --> 45:47.940
Yeah, no, that's nothing.

45:48.660 --> 45:53.140
I know, I've seen gout as you guys swollen toe because you drink too much wine and you

45:53.140 --> 45:54.340
live too high on the hog.

45:54.900 --> 45:56.260
That's exactly it.

45:56.260 --> 45:57.460
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

45:57.460 --> 45:57.700
Please.

45:57.700 --> 46:00.580
Yes, I hope podcast Krampus doesn't steal it.

46:02.580 --> 46:06.660
I like the idea of podcast Krampus because I feel like it's a very relatable thing for

46:06.660 --> 46:08.020
podcast creators.

46:08.020 --> 46:09.460
It's just losing shit.

46:09.460 --> 46:11.140
I listen to a lot of worst idea of all time.

46:11.140 --> 46:14.180
Those guys have lost like a dozen episodes at this point.

46:14.180 --> 46:16.900
Fucking podcast Krampus is busy in New Zealand.

46:19.380 --> 46:22.900
This one was sent in by Yahoo Answers user game recognized game Rachel Sperling.

46:22.900 --> 46:25.380
It's by Yahoo Answers user boomhauer.

46:25.380 --> 46:28.660
Did I call Rachel Sperling Yahoo Answers user Rachel Sperling?

46:28.660 --> 46:29.780
I think you might have.

46:30.740 --> 46:33.620
At this point, it's not inaccurate.

46:33.620 --> 46:34.260
That's a good point.

46:35.140 --> 46:36.260
Boomhauer asks.

46:38.420 --> 46:43.860
If I'm at an MLB game and that's Major League Baseball, could I help my team?

46:44.820 --> 46:45.140
Sorry?

46:46.340 --> 46:47.140
Go Royals?

46:47.140 --> 46:48.020
I'm going to jump right on that.

46:48.020 --> 46:49.460
You don't have to say go Royals.

46:49.460 --> 46:50.020
They won it.

46:50.660 --> 46:52.820
But that's why I'm jumping on it because they won it.

46:52.820 --> 46:53.060
Okay.

46:53.620 --> 46:54.900
So now I'm a fan.

46:54.900 --> 46:55.540
Good, good.

46:56.500 --> 46:59.860
If I'm at an MLB game, could I help my home team get a home run this way?

47:01.380 --> 47:06.500
Say that I am at an MLB baseball game and a batter for my home team hits a ball and starts

47:06.500 --> 47:07.140
running bases.

47:07.940 --> 47:12.180
So as the opposing outfielders are looking for the ball to drop so they can throw it

47:12.180 --> 47:18.660
to home or to a baseman to try and get my batter out, what I do is throw another baseball

47:18.660 --> 47:23.220
on the field to distract them from the real ball that is actually in play.

47:23.220 --> 47:28.420
So they all go after my baseball and then even if they get him out, the ruling is reversed

47:28.420 --> 47:33.540
when it turns out that they did so with an entirely different baseball that wasn't the

47:33.540 --> 47:34.580
one in play.

47:34.580 --> 47:39.300
So just help my team get a home run through the classic Sun Tzu strategy of creating a

47:39.300 --> 47:39.780
diversion.

47:41.620 --> 47:42.260
Could this work?

47:45.140 --> 47:46.500
It happens all the time.

47:46.500 --> 47:47.140
It does happen.

47:47.140 --> 47:53.780
It happened in the World Series game five last night.

47:53.780 --> 48:03.300
The problem you're going to run into is that once you enter a second ball into play that

48:03.300 --> 48:07.540
then they have to play the rest of the game with two balls.

48:08.900 --> 48:10.340
It's like, what's that?

48:12.180 --> 48:12.980
Said two balls.

48:12.980 --> 48:13.860
Oh, excellent.

48:13.860 --> 48:14.420
Great.

48:14.420 --> 48:16.660
Yeah, it's like pinball rules when you get a multi ball.

48:16.660 --> 48:18.020
They're both in there now.

48:18.020 --> 48:22.980
You have to get two batters, two pitchers, two catchers all working.

48:22.980 --> 48:24.180
Backup catcher.

48:24.180 --> 48:25.140
Backup catcher.

48:25.140 --> 48:26.180
Pull him out of the outfield.

48:26.180 --> 48:29.620
That's what the book Catcher in the Rye is based on because that's what they call the

48:29.620 --> 48:31.060
area just behind the plate.

48:32.020 --> 48:32.900
They call that the rye.

48:35.060 --> 48:38.500
So two balls are going simultaneously and you have to keep track.

48:38.500 --> 48:45.460
Usually the judges, you know, the baseball judges, the panel will paint one of the balls

48:45.460 --> 48:47.700
red to help keep track of it.

48:47.700 --> 48:49.140
And that's the double point ball.

48:49.140 --> 48:51.940
Yeah, that's the one that's full of bonuses.

48:52.500 --> 48:58.020
And if you catch that one, nobody can touch you for like 30 seconds.

49:00.660 --> 49:02.340
I feel like these rules are getting a bit complicated.

49:02.340 --> 49:04.020
But now you have to be careful.

49:04.020 --> 49:05.220
Don't hit the green one.

49:05.220 --> 49:07.620
If you hit the green one, your team loses a point.

49:08.180 --> 49:09.380
That's the innocent ball.

49:09.380 --> 49:14.660
But if you hit the sort of glowing one, then your bat becomes imbued with those properties,

49:14.660 --> 49:17.060
which is like a plus three strength.

49:17.060 --> 49:20.660
Yeah, and then you can hit all of the basement with your bat as you run around.

49:20.660 --> 49:22.660
Yeah, but watch out because they can fight back.

49:22.660 --> 49:23.460
They got knives.

49:24.260 --> 49:27.940
Two ball baseball started as a joke to me.

49:27.940 --> 49:28.740
It would be sick.

49:28.740 --> 49:31.300
And now I really want to, it sounds way better.

49:31.300 --> 49:33.060
Can I bust it out, flip it, and reverse it for you, though?

49:33.700 --> 49:34.180
Hit me.

49:35.140 --> 49:36.740
What's the worst part of baseball?

49:36.740 --> 49:38.580
When your team is fielding.

49:38.580 --> 49:40.740
Yeah, it's just the outfield in general.

49:40.740 --> 49:43.940
It's a giant barren land where nothing exciting ever happens.

49:44.820 --> 49:46.100
Let's just get rid of it.

49:46.100 --> 49:46.740
Just infield.

49:47.620 --> 49:50.100
Just the core diamond, right?

49:50.100 --> 49:55.620
But then let's duplicate that, flip it around, mirror image.

49:55.620 --> 49:58.500
We're talking about two batters batting at each other.

49:58.500 --> 50:00.340
Oh, so like full court baseball.

50:00.340 --> 50:01.140
Full court baseball.

50:02.020 --> 50:02.820
Yeah, two balls.

50:02.820 --> 50:03.860
That's where the difference is.

50:03.860 --> 50:07.540
Full court baseball, yeah, two balls, that's where the two balls comes in.

50:07.540 --> 50:09.700
No defense, no defense whatsoever.

50:11.380 --> 50:12.900
And two gloves, one on each hand.

50:12.900 --> 50:14.340
Why they got that free hand?

50:14.340 --> 50:16.820
Yeah, just sort of like a home run death battle.

50:17.780 --> 50:18.900
This is amazing.

50:18.900 --> 50:20.020
This is very good.

50:20.020 --> 50:21.860
Would this work in football?

50:21.860 --> 50:23.060
There's no defense.

50:23.060 --> 50:23.700
No defense.

50:23.700 --> 50:28.820
Just two teams trying to score points on each other.

50:28.820 --> 50:29.940
Yeah, at the same time.

50:29.940 --> 50:31.700
Two footballs, double the pigskin, baby.

50:31.700 --> 50:35.140
So that sounds way, because like that cuts out the point part.

50:35.140 --> 50:36.020
Let me say this.

50:36.020 --> 50:38.500
Maybe shorten the old football field.

50:38.500 --> 50:40.900
Like, you know, 100 yards is a long way.

50:40.900 --> 50:42.260
I can't imagine going that far.

50:42.900 --> 50:44.020
Oh, go ahead.

50:44.980 --> 50:46.340
Do you think I'm going for arena football?

50:46.340 --> 50:47.460
Because that's not what I was going for.

50:47.460 --> 50:48.500
Oh, dang.

50:48.500 --> 50:50.180
No, no one wants to watch arena football.

50:50.180 --> 50:53.140
No one even wants to hear us tell jokes about arena football.

50:53.140 --> 50:55.060
I'm just talking like 25 yards.

50:55.060 --> 50:55.460
Oh my God.

50:55.460 --> 50:56.660
Whoa, okay.

50:56.660 --> 50:59.860
Yeah, I can conceptualize running 25 yards.

50:59.860 --> 51:02.740
So like that's how far it would need to be for me to play football.

51:03.700 --> 51:07.940
This pro crazy football that is like a future sport at this point.

51:07.940 --> 51:10.100
Yeah, and it only goes like 15 minutes.

51:10.100 --> 51:10.980
I mean, oh, shit.

51:10.980 --> 51:12.020
Oh, fuck.

51:12.020 --> 51:13.940
Advertising is at a premium.

51:13.940 --> 51:15.620
That sounds real digestible, yeah.

51:15.620 --> 51:19.460
Yeah, this sounds like, this kind of sounds like NFL Blitz at this point.

51:19.460 --> 51:21.300
The street football.

51:21.300 --> 51:22.500
Sounds like NFL shits.

51:22.500 --> 51:25.780
Can I hit you guys with another idea that's even better than all the ideas

51:25.780 --> 51:27.060
that you two have come up with so far?

51:27.060 --> 51:28.340
Yeah, please.

51:28.340 --> 51:30.740
NASCAR driving in circles.

51:30.740 --> 51:34.500
What if half the cars are driving one way and half the cars are driving the other way?

51:34.500 --> 51:37.060
And then it's like everybody's playing Mario Kart,

51:37.060 --> 51:38.500
but half the people are really bad at it.

51:38.500 --> 51:40.500
So they get far behind and instead of trying to win,

51:40.500 --> 51:42.100
they just like try and take the other people out.

51:42.100 --> 51:44.420
I do have to point out that this is like,

51:44.420 --> 51:46.740
we're doing this in our real lives every day.

51:46.740 --> 51:47.620
And it's just called like,

51:49.220 --> 51:51.140
homecoming traffic, different lanes.

51:51.140 --> 51:52.020
Not really that thrilling.

51:53.540 --> 51:54.820
And so just to keep it safe,

51:54.820 --> 51:56.420
we'll put a concrete divider in the middle of the road.

51:56.420 --> 51:59.380
There's going to be a bright yellow line dividing the two lanes.

51:59.380 --> 52:02.180
And then you know how sometimes like during NASCAR races,

52:02.180 --> 52:04.980
there are people like camped out in the middle and like trailers and shit.

52:04.980 --> 52:07.620
We got to give them some way to like get out of the middle of the thing.

52:07.620 --> 52:12.100
So we're going to put like a special light at one point on the racetrack

52:12.100 --> 52:14.180
that like tells the cars to like, hey, chill out.

52:14.180 --> 52:16.020
Brian's got to go refill his Diet Coke.

52:17.540 --> 52:21.380
So like a light that changes like if it's greener,

52:21.940 --> 52:23.380
then they can keep going.

52:23.380 --> 52:26.260
But if there's like a red one, then they have to stop going.

52:26.260 --> 52:27.620
Is that kind of what you're thinking?

52:27.620 --> 52:30.580
And you know, if it were me driving in a circle all day long,

52:30.580 --> 52:31.380
I'd get really bored.

52:31.380 --> 52:32.260
So I'd want some like,

52:32.900 --> 52:35.140
some like off-shoot roads that I could pull off

52:35.620 --> 52:37.380
and maybe head towards other roads.

52:37.380 --> 52:37.940
Yeah, sure.

52:37.940 --> 52:39.700
I don't see why the race has to be,

52:39.700 --> 52:42.420
I feel like the race, you should have to like find your own way.

52:42.420 --> 52:46.260
And so there should be lots of different roads leaving the racetrack.

52:46.260 --> 52:48.660
And then we can also just put a bunch of like residences

52:48.660 --> 52:49.940
and businesses to sort of all around.

52:49.940 --> 52:53.780
Yeah, so maybe I pull off the race and then like I stop at the office.

52:53.780 --> 52:56.260
Is this what the movie Cars is?

52:56.260 --> 52:58.500
I think this is basically the movie.

52:58.500 --> 53:02.260
What if people get bored in car city

53:02.260 --> 53:04.100
and they want to watch a race?

53:04.100 --> 53:08.100
So they have to maybe build a smaller go-kart track

53:08.100 --> 53:10.500
in the middle of car city that you can go to

53:10.500 --> 53:12.580
to watch an unfettered race.

53:12.580 --> 53:13.220
Yeah.

53:13.220 --> 53:16.340
And then we just keep collapsing that in on itself

53:16.340 --> 53:18.740
until we're like model cars, hot wheels,

53:18.740 --> 53:21.860
just like three guys sitting around a hot wheels track,

53:21.860 --> 53:24.660
just watching them go.

53:24.660 --> 53:26.500
It's just race cars all the way down, baby.

53:26.500 --> 53:27.540
Can we do golf?

53:27.540 --> 53:28.260
Can we do golf?

53:29.700 --> 53:32.420
What would golf be in these sort of like heightened,

53:32.420 --> 53:34.100
like 1v1 terms?

53:34.740 --> 53:37.460
I feel like you would need more than one person.

53:37.460 --> 53:40.420
I feel like a golf course, very big.

53:40.420 --> 53:43.380
People, very small, like an army.

53:43.380 --> 53:46.820
100 people batting in a circle for a hole in the middle of all of them.

53:46.820 --> 53:47.860
Last man standing.

53:47.860 --> 53:50.020
You go laser tag rules, right?

53:50.020 --> 53:56.180
Each golfer starts at opposing sides of the golf court

53:56.820 --> 54:02.180
and each one has a hole and a flag taped to their back,

54:02.180 --> 54:02.900
like coming out of their back.

54:02.900 --> 54:03.940
Oh, fuck.

54:03.940 --> 54:08.100
You're just like beaming golf balls at like,

54:08.100 --> 54:09.140
hey, I got a hole in Doug.

54:10.740 --> 54:12.900
Just sink it, just sink a hole in Doug.

54:12.900 --> 54:14.100
Man, that was a par four Doug.

54:14.100 --> 54:17.220
That was an incredible, incredible shot, Henry.

54:17.220 --> 54:19.380
Yeah, he hit up a tree, but I still got him.

54:19.380 --> 54:20.260
Still got him.

54:20.260 --> 54:22.900
He did fall out of the tree, landed right on his C6.

54:22.900 --> 54:23.940
Do you know what though?

54:23.940 --> 54:26.900
This is a realistic application for a backflip.

54:26.900 --> 54:29.780
Like if you can reliably do a backflip,

54:29.780 --> 54:31.620
no one's ever going to score on you.

54:31.620 --> 54:34.340
Nobody's ever golf dunked on Austin St. John.

54:36.580 --> 54:38.020
Hasn't been done.

54:38.020 --> 54:38.740
What are you trying to do?

54:38.740 --> 54:39.620
Forward, nice try.

54:43.380 --> 54:43.780
Flip.

54:43.780 --> 54:46.020
Oh, I'll get you Austin St. John.

54:46.660 --> 54:47.380
Rubble, rubble.

54:47.380 --> 54:49.780
Well, I don't think the Hamburglar

54:49.780 --> 54:52.180
was a Mighty Morphin Power Rangers villain.

54:52.180 --> 54:53.460
He had to get work after there.

54:54.340 --> 54:56.500
Rita, what was her fucking name?

54:56.500 --> 54:57.620
Rita Repulsa.

54:57.620 --> 54:58.420
Damn, Justin.

54:58.420 --> 55:00.260
Nice, good pull.

55:00.260 --> 55:00.900
Good pull, right?

55:02.100 --> 55:02.980
Should we end the show?

55:04.020 --> 55:04.580
Uh, no.

55:07.220 --> 55:09.140
Okay, this has been my brother,

55:09.140 --> 55:11.620
my brother, me, and it's a vice show for the modern era.

55:11.620 --> 55:13.220
I hope you guys liked this second take.

55:13.220 --> 55:17.380
Yeah, we said different things, so that's good.

55:17.380 --> 55:20.260
So that other one's just lost the time in memorial.

55:20.260 --> 55:21.300
Sorry about that.

55:21.300 --> 55:24.020
God, I fucking hate podcast crampus so much.

55:26.900 --> 55:29.060
We should tell you, we mentioned earlier,

55:29.060 --> 55:30.260
but just to reiterate,

55:31.140 --> 55:33.300
we are doing the Candle Nights show

55:34.260 --> 55:36.580
again here in Huntington, West Virginia.

55:36.580 --> 55:38.260
We're going to have Sawbones there

55:39.300 --> 55:42.020
and it's going to be a lot of fun,

55:42.020 --> 55:44.020
a lot of frivolity.

55:44.020 --> 55:46.100
There'll be an after party afterwards

55:46.100 --> 55:48.420
where we can like hang out and chill together

55:49.860 --> 55:56.180
and we'll have better sound than we had last year.

55:56.180 --> 56:00.100
We had some sound issues and so we'll have that fixed.

56:00.900 --> 56:02.900
If you're looking for a place to stay, by the way,

56:02.900 --> 56:05.460
the show's at the Big Sandy Superstore Arena.

56:06.100 --> 56:07.940
It's actually in one of like the smaller rooms.

56:07.940 --> 56:09.220
We're not like playing in an arena,

56:09.220 --> 56:13.140
but there is a Holiday Inn like right next door.

56:13.940 --> 56:15.060
And it's one of the nice ones.

56:15.060 --> 56:15.940
It's one of the nice ones.

56:15.940 --> 56:16.980
It's a nice Holiday Inn.

56:16.980 --> 56:20.660
And you'll be close to like shopping and some food.

56:20.660 --> 56:22.020
And industry.

56:22.660 --> 56:23.380
And industry.

56:23.380 --> 56:27.140
You're literally right next to the venue,

56:27.140 --> 56:29.140
so it's going to be sick.

56:29.140 --> 56:32.020
And City Hall and the courthouse.

56:32.020 --> 56:33.300
There's so much to see and do.

56:33.300 --> 56:35.860
Jim's Spaghetti.

56:35.860 --> 56:39.140
If you actually go to justinmaccroy.wordpress.com,

56:39.140 --> 56:41.620
I did a post last year about stuff you can do in Huntington.

56:41.620 --> 56:42.740
There's a lot of fun stuff to do.

56:42.740 --> 56:44.820
And this will be on a Monday instead of a Sunday.

56:44.820 --> 56:46.340
So like shit will be open.

56:47.620 --> 56:48.900
I want to say thanks to NatureBox,

56:48.900 --> 56:50.980
where you can order hundreds of great tasting snacks

56:50.980 --> 56:52.740
and get a naturebox.com slash my brother

56:52.740 --> 56:55.060
to sign up for a great box of great tasting snacks.

56:55.060 --> 56:57.460
I might, can I recommend Swirl?

56:59.220 --> 57:01.860
It's a new snack flavor that they have.

57:03.220 --> 57:05.460
Can I recommend Apple Attack?

57:05.460 --> 57:07.460
Apple Attack.

57:08.180 --> 57:10.020
Apple Attack sad face.

57:10.020 --> 57:11.860
Yeah, there's an emoji in there.

57:11.860 --> 57:12.980
Not a real one, again.

57:13.540 --> 57:14.740
We also want to say go check out

57:14.740 --> 57:17.140
all the other amazing maximumfun.org shows.

57:17.140 --> 57:19.140
Shows like Sawbones that Justin and Sydney do,

57:19.140 --> 57:22.180
where they talk about the history of misguided medicine.

57:22.180 --> 57:23.860
You can check out Jordan, Jesse Goh,

57:23.860 --> 57:25.220
Judge John Hodgman.

57:25.220 --> 57:27.060
I do a show with my friend Andy,

57:27.060 --> 57:29.620
where we talk about how to survive different apocalypses

57:29.620 --> 57:30.660
called Bunker Buddies.

57:31.540 --> 57:34.420
I produce and semi co-host a show called

57:34.420 --> 57:35.620
Can I Pet Your Dog?

57:35.620 --> 57:38.100
All about dogs and dog enthusiasts.

57:39.540 --> 57:40.900
There's tons of great shows on there.

57:40.900 --> 57:42.100
Go check them all out.

57:42.100 --> 57:43.140
Check every last one of them out.

57:43.140 --> 57:44.740
I want to thank John Roderick in the Long Winters

57:44.740 --> 57:46.100
for his theme song, It's a Departure,

57:46.100 --> 57:47.780
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

57:47.780 --> 57:50.340
He's a super great guy, that John Roderick.

57:51.780 --> 57:55.540
And the band's super great and the music is very great.

57:55.540 --> 57:56.900
And go listen to it because it's great.

57:56.900 --> 57:58.100
It's a great holiday album.

57:59.460 --> 58:00.500
Also, we haven't mentioned in a while,

58:00.500 --> 58:01.940
but if you've got a question for us,

58:01.940 --> 58:05.780
you can send it to mbmbamatmaximumfund.org.

58:06.420 --> 58:07.620
Just make sure that, you know,

58:07.620 --> 58:11.460
that there's some form of advice being asked for.

58:11.460 --> 58:13.220
Some people are just like, which one's better?

58:13.220 --> 58:14.820
It's like, okay, that's not,

58:14.820 --> 58:16.740
we don't really make those decisions.

58:16.740 --> 58:17.700
We give advice.

58:17.700 --> 58:20.020
So as long as you're asking for advice, it'll be great.

58:20.020 --> 58:20.980
Also, no bummers.

58:20.980 --> 58:21.860
No bummers.

58:21.860 --> 58:22.500
No bummers.

58:22.500 --> 58:23.780
Should we close it out?

58:23.780 --> 58:24.820
Yeah, we're done.

58:24.820 --> 58:26.180
Oh, I'm having a stretch.

58:27.460 --> 58:28.260
That's excellent.

58:28.260 --> 58:29.220
Excellent update.

58:29.220 --> 58:30.180
So sinewy.

58:30.180 --> 58:31.380
How about this one?

58:31.380 --> 58:33.060
It was sent in by level9000.

58:33.060 --> 58:34.180
Yeah, Drew, Drew, Drew Devonport.

58:34.180 --> 58:35.380
Thank you, Drew.

58:35.380 --> 58:38.180
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Navya, who asks,

58:40.180 --> 58:42.340
who invented the names of things?

58:45.620 --> 58:46.980
I'm Justin McElroy.

58:46.980 --> 58:48.100
I'm Travis McElroy.

58:48.100 --> 58:49.380
I'm Griffin McElroy.

58:49.380 --> 58:50.420
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

58:50.420 --> 58:51.700
Kiss your dad.

58:51.700 --> 59:01.300
Swear on the lips.

59:10.260 --> 59:12.180
Maximumfun.org.

59:12.180 --> 59:13.220
Comedy and culture.

59:13.220 --> 59:14.340
Artist owned.

59:14.340 --> 59:15.300
Listener supported.

59:16.180 --> 59:16.900
This is Biz.

59:16.900 --> 59:17.780
And I'm Teresa.

59:17.780 --> 59:22.180
And we host a show called One Bad Mother, a comedy podcast about parenting.

59:22.180 --> 59:24.180
Not a parenting podcast.

59:24.180 --> 59:25.060
Guess what?

59:25.060 --> 59:26.660
We both just had babies.

59:27.220 --> 59:27.720
Again.

59:27.720 --> 59:47.240
Check out the show enjoyed by breeders and ballers alike on iTunes or Maximumfun.org.
