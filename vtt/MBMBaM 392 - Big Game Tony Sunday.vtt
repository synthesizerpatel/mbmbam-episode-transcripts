00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:48.160
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern era.

00:48.160 --> 00:59.440
I'm your oldest brother, Justin Pigskin McElroy. I'm Travis Touchdown McElroy,

00:59.440 --> 01:05.280
and I'm Griffin McElroy. I'm a hologram this time. Couldn't get the real me. Couldn't get the

01:05.280 --> 01:12.480
meet me. This time, it's the hologram one, for this time, the episode. We all loved the big game

01:12.480 --> 01:19.680
last night, and a lot of fun was had by all, and congratulations. Or none was. It's possible no fun

01:19.680 --> 01:25.120
was had. Or maybe it all ended in a tie, and everybody just went home. Yeah, and they fell

01:25.120 --> 01:30.160
in love. All the New England's fans fell in love with all the Philadelphia's fans. Anything's

01:30.160 --> 01:33.120
possible in football, and that's what's so exciting and dynamic about this sport. That's

01:33.120 --> 01:38.960
why Vince is getting in on the action. We wanted to say in our second consecutive football intro,

01:39.760 --> 01:45.680
to both the teams, you'll get them next year. Yeah. Or you got them this year. Or you got it.

01:45.680 --> 01:49.520
You did get them this year. Maybe they both got them. Maybe they both win. Maybe they do the thing,

01:49.520 --> 01:53.440
and then the Eagles win, and they're like, you know what guys? We had so much fun,

01:53.440 --> 01:58.160
and we still have lots of fun Doritos commercials that we didn't even have time to do,

01:58.720 --> 02:05.680
because they won the game in three periods. Do you guys want to play again? What do they do

02:05.680 --> 02:10.400
if they finish the game early? Has that ever happened? All the time. All the time. And they're

02:10.400 --> 02:15.280
just like, what do we do with this leftover? Because we already got the top score, and we

02:15.280 --> 02:20.560
can't play anymore. As we all know, if your team gets to 69 points, you instantly win,

02:20.560 --> 02:27.360
whether or not you're ahead. And if you go over, you lose. Well, no, but you just don't win. So

02:27.360 --> 02:32.640
like you may want to overshoot it, right? Oh, shoot. Why did we go for two? We had 68 points,

02:32.640 --> 02:36.480
and now we have 70. Well, that means we don't get the instant win. And somebody else comes in and

02:36.480 --> 02:43.360
gets 69. Nice. They win. But it's only been one period, and it's like, wow, our defense fucking

02:43.360 --> 02:48.160
sucks. Oh, shit. Somebody caught the snitch already. Somebody caught the 69 snitch. That's

02:48.160 --> 02:53.440
the thing that you don't talk about in Quidditch, by the way. If somebody catches the snitch in the

02:53.440 --> 03:00.000
first five minutes, and you fucking paid like 800 Krugles or whatever for your box seats,

03:00.000 --> 03:05.120
and you're like, oh, it's been three minutes, and the game's done? Do I get my Krugles back? No?

03:05.120 --> 03:12.160
I just want to step in here. It would be Bitcoin. That is what wizards and warlocks use. And that's

03:12.160 --> 03:17.280
why I can't find a motherfucking graphics card for my computer, just because Hagrid's buying them all

03:17.280 --> 03:23.840
up reselling them on eBay for a thousand bucks piece of shit. So big predictions for the game

03:23.840 --> 03:33.920
this year. I have a lot of money down on like 30 bucks on one that is probably not going to happen.

03:33.920 --> 03:41.360
But if it does, it has like a 100 times buyout. So that would be like 300 bucks is the rapture

03:41.360 --> 03:47.760
happens in the middle of the game. And everyone just, well, not everyone, but most people, well,

03:47.760 --> 03:52.560
not most people. Just Tom Brady. I mean, let's say it, just Tom Brady. Do you think Jesus is

03:52.560 --> 04:00.000
going to let Tom Brady in after all the deflate gate? I don't think so. Jesus loves hard, full

04:00.000 --> 04:08.400
balls, not these soft ones that Tom likes to play with. My prediction is that if, I have to figure

04:08.400 --> 04:15.840
out the right tense here, if they will have won, if the Patriots will have won in the past, right?

04:15.840 --> 04:18.800
Yeah. Then during the post-game interview,

04:18.800 --> 04:22.320
they're going to say to Tom Brady, like, what are you going to do now? And he's going to say,

04:22.320 --> 04:25.920
I'm going to go fuck that beauty rest mattress I've had my eye on.

04:25.920 --> 04:29.680
Yeah. Yeah. He loves to do that. Puts his wiener between.

04:29.680 --> 04:33.600
You all seen that commercial, right? Where he's definitely going to have sex with that mattress

04:33.600 --> 04:36.400
and the dude's like, will there be anything else? And he's like, no,

04:36.400 --> 04:40.160
I'm just going to go fuck that mattress. And he fucks a mattress, huh?

04:40.160 --> 04:45.520
Yeah. Well, in the extended version, they edit it for TV, but you can find it on YouTube

04:45.520 --> 04:50.560
where there's a solid 10-minute rest of the commercial where he just-

04:50.560 --> 04:52.640
Oh, he fucks that. You know what? I'll say it. Makes love.

04:52.640 --> 04:56.080
You said YouTube likes that. YouTube loves it.

04:56.080 --> 05:00.320
YouTube wants that content on their channel. YouTube loves it. You can see Tom Brady make

05:00.320 --> 05:02.880
love to a mattress on YouTube. All right.

05:02.880 --> 05:06.880
And search for those words exactly. Yeah, explicitly.

05:06.880 --> 05:12.160
One of the things that I'm going to love, I did love, was the Prince hologram.

05:12.160 --> 05:17.440
Now, what's fun about the Prince hologram is everybody, I think people started joking about it

05:17.440 --> 05:21.440
at some point and then everybody started saying like, yeah, actually, now that I think about it,

05:21.440 --> 05:24.160
the way things are going, there will probably be a Prince hologram.

05:24.160 --> 05:30.240
Yeah. So Justin Timberlake and Sheila E. got on the phone.

05:30.240 --> 05:36.640
Sheila E. takes the Twitter and is like, don't even trip. JT assures me there's no hologram.

05:36.640 --> 05:42.720
But if I was going to drop a hologram, that's exactly the environment I want to drop it into.

05:42.720 --> 05:46.720
Because when you're not expecting a hologram, that's when you're going to love it the most.

05:46.720 --> 05:51.280
And you know Sheila E. can't keep a secret. Telephone, telegraph, tell a Sheila E.

05:51.280 --> 05:57.040
I want, if it will have happened, that the hologram pops up and everybody's kind of like,

05:57.040 --> 06:03.200
uh, and then like JT tries to like throw it off to Prince and Prince just like shakes his head.

06:03.200 --> 06:10.560
Yeah, I would love a hologram of Prince who was explicitly against ever being a hologram

06:10.560 --> 06:21.040
ever was just like, actually, no, dude, you can't just sort of fucking conjure me there, JT.

06:21.040 --> 06:25.040
I mean, it's fucked that you get to do the Super Bowl again anyway.

06:25.040 --> 06:31.040
And Janet is banned for life. We all kind of remember that. This is mine now.

06:31.040 --> 06:35.680
No, JT, I think maybe calm down for just a minute because it's not,

06:36.320 --> 06:41.200
you don't get to have Prince's sort of essence. Do you know what I mean, dude?

06:41.200 --> 06:44.800
Like, here's the one, here's the one way I'm okay with them doing a Prince hologram.

06:44.800 --> 06:49.360
Oh, be careful. Look at the ice below you, bud. You can see the water right through.

06:49.360 --> 06:53.840
It's wild. While JT is performing, they just cut to the stands.

06:53.840 --> 06:57.280
And Prince is just like sitting in a seat, like eating some popcorn,

06:57.280 --> 07:00.560
cut back to Justin Timberlake, right? And then people are just like, wait,

07:00.560 --> 07:06.480
was that a Prince hologram? Hold on. And then at the end of it, Justin Timberlake is

07:06.480 --> 07:09.760
banned from the Super Bowl for life. Well, congratulations to everybody.

07:09.760 --> 07:14.640
I guess is what we're trying to get at. It kind of feels like we all won.

07:14.640 --> 07:18.720
And those commercials don't get me started on the ad. You know what?

07:18.720 --> 07:25.920
I only watch the big game, which we have to call it. I only watch the big game for the ads.

07:25.920 --> 07:31.680
Tony, can you go back and edit out every time he said Super Bowl and put in big game, Tony?

07:31.680 --> 07:34.560
No, don't put in big game, Tony. Why are you laughing?

07:34.560 --> 07:38.800
Don't put in big game, Tony. We don't call the Super Bowl big game, Tony.

07:38.800 --> 07:42.720
I mean, we can if you want. You've been trying to get big game,

07:42.720 --> 07:47.040
Tony going for a long time and we told you it's not happening.

07:47.040 --> 07:51.760
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to big game, Tony 52.

07:51.760 --> 07:58.320
I'm very excited. It's big game, Tony Sunday.

07:59.920 --> 08:05.360
Are you ready for some Tony? Hey, folks, all our big screen TVs are on sale

08:05.360 --> 08:10.640
to celebrate big screen, Tony Sunday. Come on down for this big screen, Tony sale.

08:10.640 --> 08:13.440
Holy shit. Big game, Tony Sunday.

08:13.440 --> 08:16.720
Hey, let's actually help people for a change.

08:16.720 --> 08:21.200
I think we just help people with some good jokes about the big game, Tony.

08:21.840 --> 08:25.600
Hi, brothers. I work as a waiter at a Thai restaurant from 530 to 11.

08:26.560 --> 08:29.760
Seems unnecessary, but thank you for the specificity.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.120
Well, you'll find out why.

08:31.680 --> 08:36.160
One of the highlights of working here is there's a family style meal the staff gets for dinner,

08:36.160 --> 08:38.880
which the chefs put extra special love and care into.

08:38.880 --> 08:42.960
However, if it's a slow night, my boss will sometimes tell me I can go home early.

08:42.960 --> 08:44.720
That sounds nice.

08:44.720 --> 08:47.680
What this means is that I don't get dinner from the kitchen

08:47.680 --> 08:49.760
because the chefs and waiters usually eat around 10.

08:50.320 --> 08:55.200
Sometimes I can literally smell the curry cookie when my boss tells me to go home

08:55.200 --> 08:57.280
and I have to live with the fact that I don't get to eat it

08:57.280 --> 09:00.160
and instead have to survive on cereal or leftover pasta.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.960
When my boss tells me to go home, is it acceptable for me to say,

09:02.960 --> 09:06.800
no, Ashley, I'd like to stay for dinner. Thank you very much.

09:06.800 --> 09:09.680
Or is that absolutely crazy?

09:09.680 --> 09:12.480
That's from Tongue Tied in New Jersey.

09:13.200 --> 09:17.360
This is, well, see, here's, okay.

09:17.360 --> 09:21.280
The reason you get sent home is because there's not enough business

09:21.280 --> 09:23.600
to justify paying for you to be there.

09:23.600 --> 09:28.960
What is the window of time that you would have to be within 10 o'clock

09:29.600 --> 09:31.440
that it would not be weird if you said,

09:31.440 --> 09:37.200
okay, I'm off the clock, but I'm going to stick around until dinner time, right?

09:37.200 --> 09:40.640
Is that 15 minutes, 30 minutes, two hours?

09:41.120 --> 09:43.440
Two hours, it's not two hours.

09:43.440 --> 09:47.200
I think if it's about to pop off, I think you're fine to be like,

09:47.200 --> 09:49.440
can I, you mind if I kick it and just eat?

09:49.440 --> 09:52.720
Because I would love to just grub here if that's fine by you.

09:52.720 --> 09:55.040
The boss is like, grub away, grub away.

09:55.040 --> 10:04.560
This one's challenging for me because my two favorite things in Earth is eaten and not working.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.800
And so it sounds like these two things are so diametrically opposed.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.520
If you tell me I'm going to send you home an hour early,

10:11.520 --> 10:16.160
I think that's another hour of Monster Hunter I can play before my body has to go to sleep.

10:16.160 --> 10:17.520
And that's very good to me.

10:17.520 --> 10:21.200
It's almost as good as eating this good free food it sounds like,

10:21.200 --> 10:23.920
which is also something I'm extremely into.

10:23.920 --> 10:27.520
So in my mind, you're looking at a win-win.

10:27.520 --> 10:29.280
This is a great job because it's a win-win.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.160
Every night you work.

10:30.160 --> 10:35.600
Either you get to go home early and spend an hour or two doing shit you'd rather do than work,

10:36.240 --> 10:37.760
or you work the whole time.

10:39.040 --> 10:41.920
But then you get to eat some yum stuff.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.320
And that's very good too.

10:44.320 --> 10:48.400
I think you need to celebrate sort of either way this thing breaks.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.120
But that's what I'm saying.

10:49.120 --> 10:52.640
I think 20 minutes, half hour of like, okay, cool.

10:52.640 --> 10:53.520
I'm off the clock.

10:53.520 --> 10:59.600
I mean, because you could ostensibly like just shoot the shit with the boss until dinner is,

10:59.600 --> 11:02.240
you know, and then be like, oh, well, as long as I'm here, right?

11:02.240 --> 11:05.120
Oh, stall them in a conversation.

11:05.120 --> 11:06.400
That's very good, Travis.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.880
Where it's like, you don't explicitly ask to be sent home.

11:08.880 --> 11:14.400
You just enjoy their company so much that eventually it'd be like rude for you to leave then.

11:14.400 --> 11:15.360
The dinner's coming out.

11:15.360 --> 11:16.560
It's time for me to just kick it.

11:17.840 --> 11:20.480
Can we talk for a second about getting sent home early from work?

11:20.480 --> 11:24.800
Because there's really nothing better than that.

11:24.800 --> 11:25.520
And it's fun.

11:25.520 --> 11:29.760
And the fun thing about that is you don't get paid when you get sent home from work.

11:29.760 --> 11:35.120
And you ostensibly got a job because you did want to get paid for time rendered.

11:35.120 --> 11:40.320
But that value proposition, something about getting sent home an hour early,

11:40.320 --> 11:43.040
that value proposition just goes straight out the window.

11:43.040 --> 11:49.200
Like, if you could just stream together weeks of getting sent home early,

11:49.200 --> 11:52.720
I mean, again, financially, you're going to be in ruin.

11:52.720 --> 11:53.120
Yeah.

11:53.120 --> 11:55.760
It just, nothing goes down sweeter than that.

11:55.760 --> 11:59.120
And you absolutely lose that when you work for yourself.

11:59.120 --> 12:04.000
Or like when you, because like I remember even before like working from home,

12:04.000 --> 12:08.320
when I worked at the theater, I wasn't hourly.

12:08.320 --> 12:09.440
I was salary.

12:09.440 --> 12:15.840
And so like leaving early was a decision I made and always made me feel guilty and bad.

12:15.840 --> 12:19.440
But having a boss type person who looks at me and goes,

12:19.440 --> 12:21.360
this decision isn't up to you.

12:21.360 --> 12:24.240
I'm telling you to go home and take a nap.

12:24.240 --> 12:26.080
It's like, okay.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.360
I like it the opposite.

12:27.360 --> 12:29.120
I added him a bim bam.

12:29.120 --> 12:38.080
And then I'm like, time to yank the old pterodactyl whistle and clock out.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.040
Jesus.

12:39.040 --> 12:40.080
Okay, okay.

12:40.080 --> 12:48.480
So like, for instance, you should have gotten to the end of that sentence quicker Griffin.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.120
My, oh, oh, my back hitting that podcast.

12:51.120 --> 12:52.480
It's a flaring up.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.640
Guess the rainstorms coming in.

12:54.640 --> 12:56.160
Better punch out.

12:56.160 --> 12:58.480
Play some Monster Hunter for nine hours.

12:58.480 --> 12:59.280
Oh, my back.

12:59.920 --> 13:01.040
You've earned it.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.240
I think I earned it.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.640
Stay at the podcast minds.

13:04.640 --> 13:07.200
Or just, you can probably just take the food, right?

13:07.200 --> 13:08.960
Like nobody's going to yell at you.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.400
Well, not if it's not ready.

13:11.520 --> 13:13.520
I mean, it's curry.

13:13.520 --> 13:17.760
You could probably just throw it on a pot at home and get it to where it needs to be.

13:17.760 --> 13:18.480
Oh, that's good.

13:18.480 --> 13:20.240
Okay, Griffin has a great point.

13:20.240 --> 13:24.000
What you do is you go in the kitchen with a Tupperware and you just start scooping things

13:24.000 --> 13:25.200
out of pots as they're cooking.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.320
Like, don't worry, bros.

13:26.320 --> 13:27.600
I'll finish this one at home.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.640
Yeah, I mean, curry is a lot of principle work, right?

13:30.640 --> 13:37.200
It's a lot of chopping and screwing and boiling and then simmering and then simmering and then

13:37.200 --> 13:40.160
really like 90% of it's just mostly simmering.

13:40.160 --> 13:41.680
You can do that at home.

13:41.680 --> 13:44.000
You just throw it on the pot and then-

13:44.000 --> 13:49.280
Yeah, that's a real good way to cut out the love and care too that the chefs usually provide

13:49.280 --> 13:52.400
if you consistently say, well, I could just do this myself.

13:52.400 --> 13:55.920
I feel like the love and the care is in the mise en place.

13:55.920 --> 13:59.200
Like after that, it's just heat and time.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.000
Like you could do that.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.760
Yeah, stove top don't care.

14:01.760 --> 14:02.720
Stove top don't love.

14:03.760 --> 14:04.400
It's all right, guys.

14:04.400 --> 14:06.000
I'll nuke it at home.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.880
How long do you think I need to nuke this to finish up your work?

14:08.880 --> 14:10.160
I'm not saying curry is easy to cook.

14:10.160 --> 14:11.200
It's extremely difficult.

14:11.200 --> 14:15.760
But what me and Justin are saying is like most of that stuff comes in the beginning of it

14:15.760 --> 14:18.880
when you sort of build the house that the curry is going to live in.

14:18.880 --> 14:21.600
And then you sort of let that house settle on the stove top.

14:21.600 --> 14:25.440
And I think it comes right at the end when the person lifts the lid at the very end to

14:25.440 --> 14:28.320
check it, kisses the surface of the curry.

14:28.320 --> 14:28.800
Yes.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.680
And that's where the love gets infused into it.

14:31.680 --> 14:36.880
And you know really like a master curry chef by how blistered and horribly scarred their

14:36.880 --> 14:40.000
lips are from kissing this extremely hot stuff.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
And can they get the lipstick print to stay on the surface of the curry?

14:44.000 --> 14:45.280
It's hard, man.

14:45.280 --> 14:49.520
Yeah, don't you guys hate when you get takeout curry and you take a bite and you're like,

14:49.520 --> 14:50.240
ugh.

14:50.240 --> 14:53.280
You can tell they've only kissed it like two or three times.

14:53.280 --> 14:56.960
It's like if I had known that when I was there, I would have just asked for extra kisses

14:57.600 --> 14:58.320
while I was already there.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.720
I could drive back out to get the rest of my kisses.

15:00.720 --> 15:04.160
And not only that, Justin, it's also like the peanut butter where you open it up and

15:04.160 --> 15:06.720
there's the surface level, right, where the kiss was.

15:06.720 --> 15:09.680
And if that's already been scooped out and you're getting down to like the middle of

15:09.680 --> 15:13.440
the peanut butter, like did the kiss make it all the way down there?

15:13.440 --> 15:14.000
You know what I mean?

15:14.000 --> 15:14.640
So that's the problem.

15:14.640 --> 15:18.080
If someone makes a big old pot of curry, like a big old pot, they kiss the top.

15:18.080 --> 15:22.080
Even if they kiss it 10 times, is that really making it to the bottom third of the curry?

15:22.640 --> 15:25.840
The thing is you have to kiss your ingredients as you go.

15:25.840 --> 15:28.400
That's the only way to make sure that you're really well covered.

15:29.280 --> 15:29.920
That's so true.

15:29.920 --> 15:31.760
Griffin, how about Yahoo?

15:31.760 --> 15:34.560
Blue Apron kisses all their stuff for you, so you don't have to worry about that.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.560
It shows up pretty smooched.

15:36.560 --> 15:39.440
You do have to kiss your own salt and pepper and olive oil, though.

15:39.440 --> 15:39.680
Yes.

15:39.680 --> 15:43.200
Sometimes there's a disposable ramekin of kisses in case you want to add more and you

15:43.200 --> 15:44.160
can handle it.

15:44.160 --> 15:44.480
Yeah.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.240
This one was sent in by the delivery man, Seth Carlson.

15:46.240 --> 15:46.720
Thank you, Seth.

15:46.720 --> 15:48.160
It's Yahoo Answers user.

15:49.760 --> 15:57.120
MiniMiniTeckel asks, do doves like being used for magic tricks?

15:57.120 --> 15:59.120
Huh.

16:01.280 --> 16:01.600
Ethics.

16:01.600 --> 16:02.400
Huh.

16:02.400 --> 16:03.360
Ethics, y'all.

16:03.360 --> 16:04.720
Been watching a lot of Good Place.

16:04.720 --> 16:07.840
Just the ethics, though, of this one is a real challenge.

16:07.840 --> 16:08.400
Is this...

16:08.400 --> 16:10.960
Okay, how is this not already a cartoon movie?

16:10.960 --> 16:11.360
I've got...

16:11.360 --> 16:11.760
Hold on.

16:12.480 --> 16:14.720
Cartoon movie.

16:14.720 --> 16:17.600
Hey, Travis, read me everything on that shitty notepad right now.

16:17.600 --> 16:19.120
I want to know everything you got.

16:19.120 --> 16:19.600
No, no, no.

16:19.600 --> 16:21.280
I'm Googling it first just to make sure.

16:22.720 --> 16:26.800
Okay, understand what I think about you and sort of how your brain works that I was

16:26.800 --> 16:31.840
100% sure you had a notebook full of half-baked movie.

16:31.840 --> 16:32.960
No, I absolutely do.

16:32.960 --> 16:35.280
In my phone, I do keep a running note.

16:35.280 --> 16:38.800
The other day, I just wrote down taglines for movies that don't exist, and my favorite

16:38.800 --> 16:41.360
one was, she's one hip granny.

16:41.360 --> 16:46.400
And it's about a grandmother who gets hip surgery and has a bionic hip that maybe turns

16:46.400 --> 16:49.440
into a superhero or some kind of dance champion.

16:49.440 --> 16:49.680
Yeah.

16:49.680 --> 16:50.000
Don't know.

16:50.000 --> 16:50.960
Haven't fleshed it out.

16:50.960 --> 16:56.880
I think it would be hard to make a compelling animated feature about a bird that spends

16:56.880 --> 16:59.600
multiple hours at a time in a man's armpit.

16:59.600 --> 17:00.080
Yeah.

17:00.080 --> 17:04.560
That, I don't think that that, like you could get Jason Sudeikis to do the voice if you

17:04.560 --> 17:06.560
wanted to, still would not be...

17:06.560 --> 17:08.240
The footage, the visual element of the film.

17:08.240 --> 17:10.800
Just the visual element of very dark...

17:10.800 --> 17:14.000
That's a good twist for the ending though, like a bird, like a dove who's trying to,

17:14.000 --> 17:18.640
maybe it's a pigeon, right, who isn't a dove, and the pigeon's trying to break into show

17:18.640 --> 17:22.320
business, and everyone's like, we only bring doves in here, and the pigeon's like, I can

17:22.320 --> 17:26.560
do it, right, and the pigeon's training, and then at the end, he's like, oh yeah, you

17:26.560 --> 17:30.000
know what, you made it, come on bird, but then the bird, the end of the movie is just

17:30.000 --> 17:32.560
like him in a sleeve, and he's like, oh this isn't...

17:32.560 --> 17:33.040
Oh wait.

17:33.040 --> 17:33.840
Yeah, this sucks.

17:33.840 --> 17:34.320
This sucks.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.400
All right, let's break it down, pros and cons.

17:36.400 --> 17:43.760
Okay, the con, I think that like any performer, the dove probably hates the part where she's

17:43.760 --> 17:50.800
in a person's armpit, but then for many hours, that part is probably not a big hit, but I

17:50.800 --> 17:55.600
think that the dove probably loves the part where everybody's like, oh shit, a dove.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.400
Yeah, people are...

17:56.400 --> 17:57.680
Like that's gotta be thrilling.

17:57.680 --> 18:00.560
Think of a time where you are that excited to see a bird.

18:00.560 --> 18:01.360
It's almost...

18:01.360 --> 18:01.840
Never.

18:01.840 --> 18:02.800
Pretty much never.

18:02.800 --> 18:10.000
My like interest in birds is a sliding scale to they're up in the sky, they're in a tree,

18:10.000 --> 18:14.320
okay, they're right in front of me on the sidewalk as I'm walking towards them, I'm

18:14.320 --> 18:17.440
a little interested, I hope that thing flies away before I get to it, it almost certainly

18:17.440 --> 18:21.760
will, I'm not worried about it, to it gets in my house somehow, oh god, oh god, I'm

18:21.760 --> 18:27.440
extremely interested in this bird, but not really excited for its presence, to oh shit,

18:28.080 --> 18:29.840
where did that thing even come from?

18:29.840 --> 18:32.640
Probably the armpit, but that's still kind of an impressive feat.

18:33.280 --> 18:39.600
Now to counteract the counter for the armpit thing is magicians are known to train their

18:39.600 --> 18:45.280
bodies to get a lot of space in there, I don't know, like Pin, Pin has like, you could get

18:45.280 --> 18:48.880
like a gallon and a half of water inside of Pin's armpit.

18:48.880 --> 18:51.120
Yeah, it's a deep, deep, deep pit.

18:51.120 --> 18:55.360
Chris Angel, before he started doing sort of more transgressive magical acts, he did

18:55.360 --> 18:56.880
a lot of sort of dove work.

18:56.880 --> 19:03.440
You, I mean, you could eat an entire bowl of gazpacho, like a full, like full belly's

19:03.440 --> 19:07.680
worth of gazpacho out of that dude's pit, if you were nasty.

19:07.680 --> 19:12.960
He actually had a lot of his dove pockets removed to make it harder on him to do magic

19:12.960 --> 19:15.840
because it was just, he lost sort of the thrill of it.

19:15.840 --> 19:20.880
You know, I'm thinking about what that moment must be like for the dove, right?

19:20.880 --> 19:26.400
You're in a dark armpit, you know, and you're like, I hate this, and then you come out the

19:26.400 --> 19:31.920
sleeve and you're like, you get half a second of like, oh yes, I'm out, and then it's all

19:31.920 --> 19:36.640
bright lights and techno music and people clapping really loudly and you're probably

19:36.640 --> 19:38.240
like, put me back in that armpit.

19:39.040 --> 19:40.000
This sucks.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.680
It's probably a little bit spooky.

19:41.680 --> 19:46.240
I've never been physically present for a show where a dove is magically sent out in the

19:46.240 --> 19:49.040
audience after a magician does his incredible trick.

19:50.160 --> 19:55.840
I think that would be highly distracting because that has gone from magic trick almost instantly

19:55.840 --> 19:59.200
devolves from magic trick into serious scenario.

19:59.200 --> 20:04.400
I would be clocking that bird for the rest of the program, just making sure that its

20:04.400 --> 20:09.280
movements did not hove into my sort of like, action scene.

20:09.280 --> 20:11.600
Because what, somebody in the audience has to get the dove.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.200
Like somebody's gonna have to grab the dove.

20:13.200 --> 20:18.400
Yeah, well I think the closest we've come, Justin, is when we went to the pirate adventure

20:19.840 --> 20:21.760
and they sent out a big old parrot.

20:22.400 --> 20:26.480
Big old parrot made a loop and then I get, never showed up again for the rest of the

20:26.480 --> 20:31.760
show, which I do have to think like, I wish I could do that as a performer, like be in

20:31.760 --> 20:36.160
a play where I just come out pre-show, hi everybody, and then I sit backstage and I

20:36.160 --> 20:37.120
eat some fruit.

20:37.120 --> 20:38.320
Here's a big wild dog.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.440
I'm just gonna let it out into the audience for the rest of the show.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.040
Keep an eye on it.

20:43.040 --> 20:43.840
Don't look at it.

20:46.000 --> 20:51.600
How come parrot is okay to be out inside bird, but pretty much most other birds if they're

20:51.600 --> 20:55.920
outside in the house, it's like, if I go into a house and there's a parrot just like chilling,

20:55.920 --> 20:59.600
not in any sort of captivity, I'm like, yeah, all right.

20:59.600 --> 21:02.640
Any other bird, I'm like, you know, you've got a pigeon in here, right?

21:02.640 --> 21:05.440
You know, even a parrot.

21:05.440 --> 21:08.880
A really fun goof would be like, invite someone over to your house for the first time, and

21:08.880 --> 21:12.160
there's like a parrot on a stand right, and then they're like, oh, a parrot, and you

21:12.160 --> 21:13.360
react like, what?

21:13.360 --> 21:15.360
Oh, God, how did that get in here?

21:15.360 --> 21:16.960
It's because it can talk, right?

21:16.960 --> 21:17.760
That's it?

21:17.760 --> 21:20.240
That's because it's big, easy to spot.

21:20.240 --> 21:20.720
I think it's size.

21:20.720 --> 21:28.160
My concern about animal size can be plotted on a sort of bell curve to, the peak of the

21:28.160 --> 21:32.880
bell curve is the likelihood with which I could spin kick the animal.

21:32.880 --> 21:40.240
So like, if it's very small, if it's a mouse or pigeon, which is a mouse that flies, that

21:40.240 --> 21:43.280
I would have a very hard time spin kicking.

21:43.280 --> 21:48.640
If it gets larger than that to like medium range, like a parrot, absolutely, absolutely

21:48.640 --> 21:51.920
one flying spin kick, I could take that down.

21:51.920 --> 21:58.560
If it gets bigger than that, a very, very, like a bear, right, I could spin kick it all

21:58.560 --> 21:59.520
day long.

21:59.520 --> 21:59.840
Yes.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.760
It's not going to have the desired effect.

22:01.760 --> 22:09.040
So on the x-axis is ability to spin kick, and on the y-axis is impact of spin kick.

22:09.040 --> 22:13.200
Well, yeah, and there's a z-axis of need to spin kick, because I want to make it clear,

22:13.200 --> 22:18.480
I'm assuming Justin's talking about self-defense here, and not that he is some sort of small

22:18.480 --> 22:25.120
game, the smallest game hunter who goes around with an insatiable desire to spin kick God's

22:25.120 --> 22:25.920
creations.

22:25.920 --> 22:28.000
The new sequel, it's a monster hunter.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.160
Yeah, Justin spin kicks a bunch of birds.

22:30.160 --> 22:35.920
I need to know, I could defend my family from the animal via spin kick, if need be.

22:35.920 --> 22:41.920
Because there is also a number of like, one parrot v. a hundred pigeons, you know what

22:41.920 --> 22:42.240
I mean?

22:42.240 --> 22:48.160
Like, we could get into some Tippi Hedren shit of just like, I don't mind a dove.

22:48.160 --> 22:50.560
Oh no, a thousand doves.

22:50.560 --> 22:51.680
That's how birds ends.

22:51.680 --> 22:57.600
Tippi Hedren does a sick street fighter spin kick, gets like 20 doves at a time in that

22:57.600 --> 22:58.000
kick.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.480
I want to make another point here.

23:00.480 --> 23:05.920
I feel like there would be sort of a mounting resentment for a dove used in a magic trick,

23:05.920 --> 23:13.600
because there really is not much career advancement you could seek beyond that as a dove, aside

23:13.600 --> 23:17.200
from John Woo movie use.

23:17.200 --> 23:18.080
Yes, huge.

23:18.080 --> 23:23.440
And that is a very small, or like even the job pool for this one, very competitive, is

23:23.440 --> 23:25.200
sign of a miracle from God.

23:25.840 --> 23:30.720
And that's, that's, that's a, I don't even know where you apply, like you can't get,

23:30.720 --> 23:34.720
Zip Recruiter is great, but I don't think you can get on Zip Recruiter, a bird Zip Recruiter

23:34.720 --> 23:41.120
and say like, great dove, beautiful wings, beautiful lustrous beak, looking to be used

23:42.000 --> 23:44.640
to show people that it's going to stop raining real soon from God.

23:44.640 --> 23:50.240
Uh, Trav, can I check in with you real quick and see how much energy you expended trying

23:50.240 --> 23:52.640
to come up with a punny name for a bird related to Zip Recruiter?

23:52.640 --> 23:55.360
Oh, a lot Justin, thank you for asking.

23:55.360 --> 23:58.240
I was sitting here in silence trying to do it.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.040
That's exactly what was going on, thank you for asking.

24:03.040 --> 24:07.440
Yeah, do you have any failed, uh, failed things that you just want to like throw out there?

24:07.440 --> 24:12.720
Was, Travis, did, in the last 30 seconds has, has the word bird recruiter crossed your mind

24:12.720 --> 24:13.040
sort of reflexively?

24:13.040 --> 24:18.000
No, it was more like tweet recruiter, I was trying to do it like bird sounds,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
cheap recruit, you know, like something in there.

24:20.640 --> 24:23.840
Um, and I just, and I honestly just wasn't getting there.

24:23.840 --> 24:29.680
It just wasn't, I didn't even have any false starts, the engine wasn't even turning over

24:29.680 --> 24:34.080
because I, I was simultaneously trying to come up with a punny name for it and also

24:34.720 --> 24:40.480
thinking, man, I hope that there's not like a whole like, magicians are bad to doves kind of thing.

24:40.480 --> 24:46.480
Um, let me, let's like, let's lay that on the table and yell at it.

24:46.480 --> 24:48.320
It's not a nice thing to do.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.760
One of my cool metrics is when I do it to a human child,

24:51.760 --> 24:55.840
because I don't think that I would do that to a human child.

24:55.840 --> 24:59.840
I put it in my sleeve and, and then throw it out into an audience.

25:01.040 --> 25:04.880
Yeah, when you put it like that, it's an uncool thing.

25:04.880 --> 25:05.280
You're right.

25:05.280 --> 25:06.720
It's an, it's inhumane.

25:06.720 --> 25:09.200
And I think we can put, put, put this to bed.

25:09.200 --> 25:10.960
Doves do not like being used for magic tricks.

25:10.960 --> 25:14.160
And so I would like to present to you the magic trick of the future.

25:14.160 --> 25:18.640
You see me, I've got a white cloth and I say, keep an eye on this cloth, folks.

25:18.640 --> 25:20.400
You're going to love what happens next.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.960
And then I tuck it into my sleeve or whatever magicians do.

25:24.960 --> 25:30.400
And then I pull out a drone and then I just kind of fly the drone around the audience for a little

25:30.400 --> 25:31.520
bit for like 10 minutes.

25:31.520 --> 25:34.240
And that's going to eat up a lot of magic showtime.

25:34.240 --> 25:38.640
I actually think that that would, that is far more impressive than a duh.

25:38.640 --> 25:39.200
Okay, cool.

25:39.200 --> 25:40.640
It's a small drone.

25:40.640 --> 25:43.520
I'm not talking about like one of those big ones they use for movies and shit.

25:43.520 --> 25:46.000
I'm not talking about one of those Avatar 2 drones.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.720
I'm talking about like a little one, stocking stuffer drone.

25:48.720 --> 25:50.240
Here's, okay, here's a movie.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.800
All right, here's, here's a cool magic trick.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.560
No, go ahead and say the movie, Trav.

25:55.200 --> 25:55.440
Okay.

25:55.440 --> 25:57.040
Just chase that instinct, bud.

25:57.040 --> 25:59.040
There's no reason to shy away from it.

25:59.040 --> 25:59.680
Okay.

25:59.680 --> 26:01.440
Here's the magic movie about doves.

26:02.080 --> 26:06.560
So the dove, it's all about, it's kind of a John Henry kind of thing where now there's

26:06.560 --> 26:11.600
a mechanical dove being brought in who does his own magic tricks and the dove has to outperform

26:12.240 --> 26:12.800
the drone.

26:13.520 --> 26:19.840
But also, sorry, the dove, the dove is the magician.

26:21.040 --> 26:25.200
Cause this can be great if, if a magician pulls a dove out and the dove's like, oh

26:25.200 --> 26:25.440
yeah.

26:25.440 --> 26:30.320
And the dove lifts up its wing and produces like a bee and it's yeah.

26:30.320 --> 26:30.560
Yeah.

26:31.360 --> 26:34.160
And then the bee pulls out some plankton or something like that.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.360
And it's like, what's up?

26:35.360 --> 26:36.080
What's up?

26:36.080 --> 26:39.280
And then the plankton lifts up and what's that as a blue whale?

26:39.280 --> 26:40.960
And it just starts all over again.

26:41.840 --> 26:45.120
That's what the circle of life is from Lion King.

26:45.840 --> 26:46.720
How about another question?

26:47.360 --> 26:48.240
Yeah, I'd love that.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.000
Don't put doves in your armpits.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.840
I accidentally, I'm looking over these questions and realizing the first three are all about

26:53.840 --> 26:54.400
food.

26:54.400 --> 26:58.880
And then I just remembered I didn't eat breakfast, so they might all be connected.

26:58.880 --> 27:00.160
Anyways, next question.

27:00.720 --> 27:04.640
While leaving our apartment today, my boyfriend and I found a torn open unmarked cardboard

27:04.640 --> 27:09.200
box full of 10 boxes of Tagalong Girl Scout cookies in our lawn.

27:09.840 --> 27:13.920
It was rained on, but none of the cookie boxes are damaged.

27:13.920 --> 27:19.040
There is a receipt with the attended address in it, but the address is half a mile away.

27:19.040 --> 27:23.520
The address also belongs to the house that I lived next to last year.

27:24.240 --> 27:25.840
And they were terrible neighbors.

27:25.840 --> 27:26.320
God.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.160
Can we keep these?

27:28.720 --> 27:30.800
Are they ours now?

27:30.800 --> 27:34.560
Or will we end up in some horrible cookie hell?

27:34.560 --> 27:39.120
That's from taking tagalongs in Muncie.

27:39.120 --> 27:49.200
Now, I don't know if this is going to be important for the show itself, but tagalongs are the

27:49.200 --> 27:52.880
ones that are like a cookie with peanut butter on top and then covered in chocolate.

27:52.880 --> 27:53.200
Yeah.

27:53.200 --> 27:54.480
Oh, shit.

27:54.480 --> 27:55.280
I love those.

27:56.000 --> 27:56.320
But-

27:56.880 --> 27:57.440
Sure, of course.

27:57.440 --> 28:00.080
Of course, that specific cookie.

28:01.360 --> 28:02.640
There's two questions here.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.880
One, are you going to eat these cookies?

28:04.880 --> 28:06.080
And they didn't even mention this.

28:06.080 --> 28:08.640
Are we going to eat these rained on outside cookies?

28:08.640 --> 28:10.400
I don't know how to begin unpacking that.

28:10.400 --> 28:11.520
I don't know how to begin answering that.

28:11.520 --> 28:12.480
Take them out of the box.

28:13.360 --> 28:15.520
No, I know how eating cookies works, Travis.

28:15.520 --> 28:16.560
I'm very good at it.

28:18.480 --> 28:22.800
The other question is returning them because here's my theory.

28:22.800 --> 28:30.080
The girl scout in this family of the neighbors you live to next to last year who were terrible

28:30.880 --> 28:35.600
is on that grift grind so hard.

28:35.600 --> 28:38.880
Yeah, it just went out, sold the whole freaking box.

28:38.880 --> 28:40.960
It was amazing.

28:40.960 --> 28:42.320
Sold the whole freaking box.

28:42.320 --> 28:43.440
Don't even worry about it.

28:43.440 --> 28:48.560
So I'm going to get my points that I need for the trip to Disneyland because of the box.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.720
Now, this grift has not been thought through very well because I mean-

28:50.720 --> 28:51.200
No, yes.

28:51.200 --> 28:56.480
What, like $40 that they, unless they stole, maybe they, you know, stole $40 or they went

28:56.480 --> 28:59.520
up to somebody and said, hey, can I just have $40?

28:59.520 --> 29:00.320
And they said, yes.

29:00.320 --> 29:01.200
And they said, good.

29:01.200 --> 29:05.600
And then they threw the box they were carrying as hard and as far away as they possibly could.

29:05.600 --> 29:08.160
I actually did a similar thing when I was a child once.

29:08.160 --> 29:09.760
This is another Travis anecdote.

29:09.760 --> 29:11.040
Is this banned candy?

29:11.040 --> 29:16.560
Yeah, it was banned candy and I ate, I think, all the bars and then like it came time to

29:16.560 --> 29:20.240
turn in the money or the unsold bars and I had to go to mom and dad and be like, hey,

29:20.240 --> 29:25.040
I need $30 because I just ate all of those and they did it.

29:25.040 --> 29:26.480
Or I will go to prison.

29:26.480 --> 29:27.120
Yeah.

29:27.120 --> 29:29.040
Yeah, in other words, candy fraud.

29:29.040 --> 29:36.080
And they did it and they were not, they were not pleased with me for, oh, so many reasons.

29:36.080 --> 29:40.560
I think you have to take the cookies to them and drop them on their porch.

29:40.560 --> 29:41.520
It's an angel test.

29:42.160 --> 29:47.280
The problem is, the problem is that you don't know, there's two things you don't know.

29:47.280 --> 29:53.120
One, have the people moved and maybe there's very nice new people there who spent the last

29:54.000 --> 29:57.280
$50 they had buying 10 boxes of tagalong cookies.

29:57.280 --> 29:58.080
Are they bad with money?

29:58.080 --> 29:58.640
Of course they are.

29:58.640 --> 30:00.560
That's how they got down to just $50 left.

30:00.560 --> 30:04.960
And bad with cookies, it sounds like, because they just left them laying on their lawn somewhere.

30:04.960 --> 30:06.000
Yeah, bad with cookies.

30:06.000 --> 30:10.480
But if you don't take the cookies as person, you're setting up a world where this person

30:10.480 --> 30:15.040
is going to be mercilessly hounding a Girl Scout asking about their cookies.

30:15.040 --> 30:16.320
And that's not very nice.

30:16.320 --> 30:20.480
Like, that's not a good reality for that poor girl to have to endure.

30:20.480 --> 30:25.360
Not only that, but I look at this and I think about all the factors here, right?

30:25.360 --> 30:26.640
10 boxes.

30:27.360 --> 30:28.320
10 boxes.

30:28.320 --> 30:29.280
10 boxes.

30:29.280 --> 30:32.960
And it appears to be rained on, but no damage to the boxes.

30:32.960 --> 30:37.280
And it just so happens to be the address of a house you live next to.

30:38.400 --> 30:42.880
And you know they're bad people, but you also know that these cookies belong.

30:42.880 --> 30:44.720
This is a test of some sort.

30:44.720 --> 30:46.800
I've been watching a lot of Good Place.

30:46.800 --> 30:49.280
And I truly believe that this is some sort of ethical-

30:49.280 --> 30:51.520
Because to have all those factors of like-

30:51.520 --> 30:52.560
All those factors.

30:52.560 --> 30:56.000
It's just far enough away that you'd have to drive there.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.720
But not so far that like you don't know where it is.

30:58.720 --> 31:00.240
You know the people who live there.

31:00.240 --> 31:01.680
Somebody's watching you.

31:02.400 --> 31:03.520
Yeah, you're being watched.

31:03.520 --> 31:10.000
If there is a van parked across the street from your place and the windows are blacked out,

31:10.000 --> 31:12.960
I can give you basically a 100% Griffon macro guarantee

31:12.960 --> 31:15.120
that John Quinones is in there somewhere.

31:15.120 --> 31:17.680
Because he's run out of ideas pretty much completely

31:18.480 --> 31:23.040
based on how many times we reference him in our podcast about situations like this.

31:23.840 --> 31:24.640
Here's the problem though.

31:24.640 --> 31:26.880
And this is where my dilemma is.

31:26.880 --> 31:28.320
This is a good thing to do, right?

31:28.320 --> 31:29.600
Taking the cookies back.

31:29.600 --> 31:30.720
That is a good thing to do.

31:30.720 --> 31:34.720
And by the way, I recognize the whole time that we've been talking about this question,

31:34.720 --> 31:37.200
you have been at home, chocolate all over your mouth.

31:37.200 --> 31:38.000
Oh no.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.920
Oh no, yeah.

31:39.920 --> 31:41.600
But it's a good thing to do.

31:41.600 --> 31:46.320
Or alternatively, you've just left a wet cookie crate in your home somewhere,

31:46.320 --> 31:47.840
which is also very unappealing.

31:48.960 --> 31:49.920
It's a good thing to do, right?

31:49.920 --> 31:54.240
Taking these cookies back, categorically, unless this is a grift

31:54.240 --> 31:56.640
and you are going to be putting this Girl Scout on blast.

31:56.640 --> 32:03.120
And you can not just turn on a fellow grifter like this.

32:04.080 --> 32:05.040
Yeah, that's true.

32:05.040 --> 32:06.080
It's really rough.

32:06.080 --> 32:09.600
Maybe you could talk to the Girl Scout about maybe cutting you in on the grift.

32:09.600 --> 32:10.720
Interesting.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.400
Now there's an idea.

32:15.200 --> 32:21.280
An unaddressed envelope, you just drop it off at their front door,

32:21.280 --> 32:27.280
is an envelope with one tag along in it as like a warning.

32:27.280 --> 32:28.560
Maybe wrapped in a napkin.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.480
I know the grift.

32:30.480 --> 32:31.680
I need a taste.

32:31.680 --> 32:33.440
I've run this one so many times.

32:34.640 --> 32:35.680
I need into your grift.

32:35.680 --> 32:37.760
And maybe you could actually help with the grift.

32:37.760 --> 32:42.480
Like you could just be like, hi, I'm looking for a tag.

32:42.480 --> 32:45.600
I want tag along so much.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.520
If you've got some coming, I'll pay you twice.

32:48.080 --> 32:50.960
If you just give me half of it now, half of the money now,

32:51.600 --> 32:54.160
I can give you twice as many tag alongs later.

32:54.160 --> 32:56.240
Yeah, the parents might answer the door though.

32:56.240 --> 33:02.480
And you have to be like, hello, your daughter sold me a box of tag along cookies.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.400
And because you got to get to her, right?

33:04.400 --> 33:06.640
To like set up the grift arrangement.

33:06.640 --> 33:11.680
And so you're like, and I don't know how to eat them.

33:11.680 --> 33:17.040
So I was hoping to get a little bit more additional details from your little salesperson.

33:17.680 --> 33:24.720
And then the grift is over because you fucked up.

33:24.720 --> 33:27.840
I wanted to discuss wine pairings.

33:27.840 --> 33:31.040
And I thought maybe she would have some suggestions.

33:31.920 --> 33:32.960
You're going to prison.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.240
Actually, if you do wine, you're going to prison.

33:34.240 --> 33:35.280
So don't do mine.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.880
Mine seems like a bad idea.

33:38.160 --> 33:39.680
No, oh, this is it.

33:39.680 --> 33:40.800
I figured out the grift.

33:40.800 --> 33:41.840
I figured out the grift.

33:42.560 --> 33:43.200
What's the grift?

33:43.200 --> 33:47.280
Okay, the person orders the boxes from the Girl Scout.

33:47.280 --> 33:50.240
The Girl Scout orders them, right?

33:50.240 --> 33:53.600
They then say the box never made it to me.

33:54.160 --> 33:56.800
Then another box of 10 tag alongs gets sent.

33:57.360 --> 33:58.800
Then that person pays for it.

33:58.800 --> 34:03.120
Then the Girl Scout goes back, collects the 10 boxes, resells those.

34:03.120 --> 34:07.120
Bada bing, bada boom, rolling in money.

34:07.120 --> 34:13.360
So wait, you think that the Girl Scout is in some sort of shipping fulfillment business

34:14.160 --> 34:21.760
where she is handling bulk orders and something went wrong somewhere in the logistical side?

34:21.760 --> 34:23.040
And she's counting on you.

34:23.040 --> 34:24.880
That's why the address is so close to you.

34:24.880 --> 34:30.000
Counting on you returning the box once the second batch has been ordered.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.920
And then that doubles up profits.

34:33.920 --> 34:35.120
It's a profits game.

34:35.680 --> 34:41.760
I don't understand why the Girl Scout has to use somebody's yard as a dead drop for this grift.

34:41.760 --> 34:44.080
It seems like she could just keep it somewhere in her home.

34:44.080 --> 34:45.440
Now they come and check that shit.

34:46.400 --> 34:47.120
Okay.

34:47.120 --> 34:48.800
The Girl Scouts are very thorough.

34:49.440 --> 34:50.320
Very thorough.

34:50.320 --> 34:52.720
I think you should return these cookies.

34:52.720 --> 34:55.360
Or one other thing you could do.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.800
PO Box 54.

34:56.800 --> 34:56.960
No.

34:56.960 --> 35:00.160
Don't make us complicit in the sin.

35:00.800 --> 35:02.880
Yeah, don't make us complicit in the sin.

35:02.880 --> 35:04.720
Also, I don't like Tagalongs that much.

35:04.720 --> 35:05.040
What?

35:05.040 --> 35:05.680
So...

35:05.680 --> 35:09.360
You scoop out the peanut butter with your teeth, you eat that chunk,

35:09.360 --> 35:10.400
and then you eat the whole cookie.

35:10.400 --> 35:11.680
What's not to love?

35:11.680 --> 35:12.880
So there is a way to eat Tagalongs.

35:12.880 --> 35:13.600
Yes, there is.

35:13.600 --> 35:14.880
There is a correct way.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.800
Okay, so maybe the scam is better than I thought.

35:16.800 --> 35:18.320
You can say that to the parents like,

35:18.320 --> 35:19.760
I need help eating these things.

35:19.760 --> 35:21.120
And like, what the fuck are you talking about?

35:21.120 --> 35:25.440
And then you take it and first you press it up into your cheek and you're like,

35:25.440 --> 35:26.960
oh, nope, missed again.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.160
Then you take just like a little bit of a nibble.

35:30.160 --> 35:31.920
You're gonna watch me do this whole thing.

35:33.120 --> 35:35.280
Is the nose involved?

35:36.080 --> 35:36.720
Please help.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.840
How much tonguey stuff should I be doing?

35:40.400 --> 35:41.680
Does she have WhatsApp?

35:41.680 --> 35:42.320
I'll just...

35:42.320 --> 35:44.080
I could just hit her up there.

35:45.120 --> 35:45.840
That would be fine.

35:46.720 --> 35:49.280
Listen, if we're gonna buy a bunch of Girl Scout Cookies of our own,

35:49.280 --> 35:51.200
I don't know if the season is on or not.

35:51.200 --> 35:51.600
I'm just saying...

35:51.600 --> 35:52.080
Oh, it is.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.080
It's on like Donkey Kong, my friend.

35:54.080 --> 35:54.880
Is it on?

35:54.880 --> 35:55.520
Okay.

35:55.520 --> 35:57.200
Well, we're gonna need the other money zone.

35:57.200 --> 35:58.400
So let's go.

36:09.120 --> 36:11.280
Our first sponsor this week is Casper.

36:11.840 --> 36:13.440
You like to sleep, coward?

36:14.240 --> 36:15.360
Whoa, huh?

36:15.360 --> 36:15.760
Wow.

36:16.320 --> 36:17.200
No, sleep is good.

36:17.200 --> 36:18.720
They want sleep to happen in this app.

36:18.720 --> 36:19.520
Oh, they want sleep.

36:19.520 --> 36:19.760
Okay.

36:19.760 --> 36:20.320
They want...

36:20.320 --> 36:20.720
Oh, good.

36:20.720 --> 36:20.960
Okay.

36:20.960 --> 36:21.680
See, you know what?

36:21.680 --> 36:22.560
I should read to the end.

36:23.120 --> 36:24.000
Sleep is good.

36:24.000 --> 36:24.400
Yeah.

36:24.400 --> 36:28.080
Which is something that Casper, a sleep brand that continues to revolutionize its line of

36:28.080 --> 36:32.400
products to create an exceptionally comfortable sleep experience one night at a time,

36:32.400 --> 36:33.200
thinks as well.

36:34.000 --> 36:38.160
They offer affordable prices because Casper cuts out the middleman.

36:38.160 --> 36:40.480
And you know, what is the middleman doing to your mattress?

36:40.480 --> 36:41.680
A lot of people don't know.

36:41.680 --> 36:44.000
Like, are they getting a sleep in on it?

36:44.000 --> 36:46.080
Are they maybe trying it out before you get to it?

36:46.080 --> 36:47.440
You don't have to worry about that with Casper.

36:47.440 --> 36:49.680
Is your middleman Tom Brady wearing a big fake mustache?

36:49.680 --> 36:51.360
Because I'll tell you what he's gonna do to your mattress.

36:51.360 --> 36:57.680
Casper Ray mattresses combine multiple, supportive, never fucked Fimmery moans.

36:57.680 --> 37:01.040
Fimmery moans?

37:01.040 --> 37:01.600
Hold on.

37:02.320 --> 37:04.160
They combine multiple...

37:04.160 --> 37:04.800
I misread.

37:04.800 --> 37:05.280
I'm sorry.

37:05.280 --> 37:06.000
I misread.

37:06.000 --> 37:06.320
Multiple, supportive...

37:06.320 --> 37:08.640
No, it says Fimmery moans here.

37:08.640 --> 37:10.000
That's on Casper.

37:10.000 --> 37:16.480
Never fucked Fimmery moans for a quality sleep surface that has the right amount of both sink

37:16.480 --> 37:18.080
and bounce, Tom.

37:18.080 --> 37:20.960
We will not be paid for this advertisement.

37:20.960 --> 37:21.840
That's fine.

37:21.840 --> 37:22.320
I get it.

37:23.680 --> 37:28.560
Kira at Max Fun, go ahead and email us when you want to set up the make good for this ad,

37:28.560 --> 37:30.720
which we will not be compensated for.

37:30.720 --> 37:35.920
You can be sure of your purchase with Casper's 100 night risk-free sleep on it trial.

37:35.920 --> 37:42.960
Get $50 towards selected mattresses by visiting Casper.com slash my brother

37:43.680 --> 37:46.880
and using promo code my brother at checkout.

37:46.880 --> 37:48.000
Terms and conditions apply.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.440
I have a really serious question.

37:49.440 --> 37:56.800
And we had a lot of fun there, but this question, I think we need to give it sort of the weight

37:56.800 --> 38:00.240
that it deserves because it's heavy.

38:01.440 --> 38:08.000
And that is, do you guys think that Tom Brady marries each mattress before he has sex with

38:08.000 --> 38:08.560
them?

38:08.560 --> 38:09.060
Yes.

38:10.800 --> 38:12.480
I want to tell you about Pro Flowers.

38:12.480 --> 38:19.680
I got a beautiful little bouquet of roses sent to me by Pro Flowers last week, and they

38:19.680 --> 38:20.640
are so lovely.

38:21.600 --> 38:22.400
It is so exciting.

38:22.400 --> 38:25.200
We've gotten Pro Flowers in like this a few times, and it's so nice.

38:25.200 --> 38:29.200
I never really think about getting flowers in the house.

38:29.200 --> 38:33.680
I'm not much of a plant guy, but it's really nice to just have a beautiful little vase

38:33.680 --> 38:38.320
of flowers just sitting in your house and making everything look good and smell good.

38:39.440 --> 38:41.600
And Pro Flowers sets you up like that.

38:41.600 --> 38:42.560
They'll send you a bouquet.

38:42.560 --> 38:43.600
They'll send you the vase you need.

38:43.600 --> 38:46.080
They'll send you the food that you need to keep the flowers fresh.

38:46.080 --> 38:46.800
It's really great.

38:47.360 --> 38:51.840
So an exclusive Valentine's Day bouquet from Pro Flowers is a perfect way to make a big

38:51.840 --> 38:52.720
impression.

38:52.720 --> 38:55.040
Pro Flowers thought inside the box, so you can too.

38:55.040 --> 38:58.960
Their flowers are boxed fresh and delivered fast, so they'll last surprisingly longer.

38:58.960 --> 39:00.000
Seven days at least.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.120
You just choose a delivery date, and it's guaranteed making you look good.

39:03.120 --> 39:08.000
Right now, our listeners can send a bouquet to their Valentine or whoever and save 20%

39:08.000 --> 39:10.640
off of their purchase of $29 or more.

39:10.640 --> 39:11.680
So hurry and order today.

39:11.680 --> 39:16.160
Valentine's Day is next week to get 20% off your purchase.

39:16.160 --> 39:16.720
Yeah, I know.

39:16.720 --> 39:20.800
To get 20% off your purchase of $29 or more, go to proflowers.com today and use the promo

39:20.800 --> 39:24.320
code MYBROTHER in the special codes box at checkout.

39:24.320 --> 39:27.600
That's proflowers.com and the code MYBROTHER.

39:27.600 --> 39:29.760
And that's the end of the ad, Pro Flowers.

39:29.760 --> 39:31.440
You can stop listening right there.

39:32.480 --> 39:36.480
One fun thing is that Pro Flowers is sponsoring three of our podcasts.

39:36.480 --> 39:40.960
So I got three boxes of Pro Flowers sent to my house on the same day.

39:41.600 --> 39:47.120
So now it kind of looks like in my house, it kind of looks like I'm trying to hide the

39:47.120 --> 39:52.960
scent of a corpse I buried underneath my floorboards because I have three vases of flowers.

39:52.960 --> 39:54.320
Now that is a good question.

39:54.320 --> 39:57.120
How would you cover up the smell of a corpse under your floorboards?

39:57.120 --> 39:58.960
Because for me, it would be Febreze.

39:58.960 --> 40:02.640
I would turn to- with these prices, I don't think you could afford not to use Pro Flowers.

40:02.640 --> 40:08.720
14 Knights of Ahriman is an asymmetrical two player unit and resource management card game.

40:08.720 --> 40:13.920
One player leads the defense of a medieval city while the other controls a reawakening ancient

40:13.920 --> 40:14.560
evil.

40:14.560 --> 40:18.400
Each player will take turns building their economy and recruiting powerful units for

40:18.400 --> 40:19.840
the ongoing war.

40:19.840 --> 40:24.400
Both players recruit from the same five decks, but a high priest in service to the city behaves

40:24.400 --> 40:27.520
quite differently than a cult leader pledged to the dark.

40:27.520 --> 40:34.000
You visit ATOZGame.com or find them on Kickstarter to see more.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.280
That sounds awesome.

40:35.280 --> 40:35.920
Yeah, that sounds extremely good.

40:35.920 --> 40:36.640
Sounds really cool.

40:37.440 --> 40:40.000
I want to get that now.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.160
And that's A-A-T-O-Z-Game.com.

40:44.160 --> 40:46.320
A-T-O-Z-Game.com.

40:46.960 --> 40:48.160
I'm just gonna go to this website.

40:48.160 --> 40:49.360
This is a nice little website.

40:49.360 --> 40:50.320
This is a nice little website.

40:50.320 --> 40:51.280
This game looks dope as hell.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.920
Just gonna go grab this one real quick.

40:53.920 --> 40:55.120
Just can't get this.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.720
While you guys do that, I'll read the next one.

40:56.720 --> 41:02.160
This is for, and these are all exclamation points, so I will try to read it.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.040
Please don't yell.

41:03.040 --> 41:03.760
Please don't yell.

41:03.760 --> 41:04.560
I'm not going to yell.

41:04.560 --> 41:05.360
I'm not going to yell.

41:05.360 --> 41:06.960
I'm just saying I edit the show, and so if you yell-

41:06.960 --> 41:07.600
I'm not going to yell.

41:07.600 --> 41:07.920
It's a lot of work for me.

41:07.920 --> 41:10.000
I'm going to try to say it with excitement.

41:10.000 --> 41:18.080
Elena, Ash, Chris, Mike, Riley, Cheryl, Erica, Patrick, Meredith.

41:18.080 --> 41:19.120
No, it is just Sherry.

41:19.760 --> 41:21.920
I think you read the exclamation point from L there.

41:21.920 --> 41:24.960
No, that's fine, because there's a free one there, because Sherry, you are included in

41:24.960 --> 41:27.600
this one, and Cheryl, just go make a friend named Sherry-

41:27.600 --> 41:30.320
Cheryl, and that's more free money zone for you.

41:31.120 --> 41:33.280
And this is from Turbles.

41:33.280 --> 41:35.600
To my beloved Vortex, pals.

41:36.240 --> 41:39.760
If all has gone according to plan, you now have a recording of a macro,

41:39.760 --> 41:42.400
exclaiming your name you can use as a ringtone.

41:43.200 --> 41:45.120
Yes, I threw one in for myself.

41:45.760 --> 41:46.800
My name is Sherry.

41:48.240 --> 41:51.120
You're all amazing people and good, good friends.

41:51.120 --> 41:55.120
Thank you for being horny for this one, even in the darkest of times.

41:55.120 --> 41:57.040
Love you always, Turbo.

41:57.040 --> 42:01.200
And that's so important that we find the ability, even in the darkest hour,

42:01.200 --> 42:03.440
to still maintain a level of horniness.

42:04.240 --> 42:10.400
Like that's- because sometimes you're like, oh no, everything seems so down and so bleak.

42:10.400 --> 42:11.520
And not horny.

42:11.520 --> 42:12.320
But still-

42:12.320 --> 42:13.440
Not horny at all.

42:13.440 --> 42:15.600
I'm so horny for this, you know?

42:15.600 --> 42:17.360
Like, it's so important.

42:17.360 --> 42:20.640
I have a message here for Clara, and it's from Savannah, who says,

42:20.640 --> 42:23.600
to the best wolf mom around, happy 21st.

42:23.600 --> 42:28.160
From Urinetown Ensemble to Company Wives, every show with you is a joy.

42:28.160 --> 42:29.920
Can't wait for you to save the oceans.

42:29.920 --> 42:32.320
I love you to shrimp heaven and back.

42:32.320 --> 42:36.160
So does all of Hoof and Horn, which is why they pitched in for this Jumbotron.

42:36.160 --> 42:42.240
Love, Julia, Wes, Karen, Maddie, Libby, Shana, Adam, Cole, Booty, and Savannah.

42:42.240 --> 42:44.480
One of those names is not like the other.

42:44.480 --> 42:46.640
And it's- it's Karen.

42:46.640 --> 42:50.560
Karen, I love when we get a Jumbotron that makes me go,

42:51.680 --> 42:51.920
what?

42:51.920 --> 42:53.920
I want to know about these people.

42:53.920 --> 42:54.160
Yeah.

42:54.160 --> 42:55.440
I want to know all about this.

42:55.440 --> 42:57.360
These sound like great people.

42:57.360 --> 42:59.520
Are they all in the Piss musical?

42:59.520 --> 43:00.320
I don't know.

43:00.320 --> 43:02.240
Are they in the Piss musical?

43:02.240 --> 43:03.440
What is Hoof and Horn?

43:03.440 --> 43:05.280
Is it like Skull and Bones?

43:05.280 --> 43:07.440
But for, you know, Buffalo?

43:07.440 --> 43:08.160
But for Buffalo?

43:08.160 --> 43:09.360
But for Buffaloes?

43:09.360 --> 43:11.360
Is this a message for like nine buffaloes?

43:12.800 --> 43:13.920
So what's the story here, y'all?

43:13.920 --> 43:16.800
Do buffaloes like being used in Magic Acts?

43:16.800 --> 43:17.600
Absolutely.

43:17.600 --> 43:18.240
They love it.

43:20.400 --> 43:20.960
Yeah, Mark.

43:20.960 --> 43:21.840
Hey, buddy.

43:21.840 --> 43:22.640
Oh, hey, what's up, man?

43:23.200 --> 43:26.160
So I'm at this mafia restaurant.

43:26.160 --> 43:26.480
What?

43:26.480 --> 43:31.280
I'm going to go in and ask these guys what they think the best pasta shape is.

43:31.280 --> 43:32.640
Mark, they're probably eating-

43:32.640 --> 43:35.360
I have a hunch that it's probably ravioli.

43:35.360 --> 43:36.000
But I mean, you know what?

43:36.000 --> 43:36.720
That's a good idea.

43:36.720 --> 43:40.080
Whatever they're eating, I'll just take a look in their bowls and see what they have.

43:40.080 --> 43:40.240
Maybe-

43:40.240 --> 43:41.600
There's supposed to be a big meeting there today.

43:41.600 --> 43:42.960
Can you see it from the street?

43:42.960 --> 43:44.320
That sounds really dangerous.

43:44.320 --> 43:45.680
I'm just going to go inside and ask.

43:45.680 --> 43:46.880
Don't, don't bother them.

43:46.880 --> 43:48.160
They're probably eating, you know-

43:48.160 --> 43:49.520
Look, I'm not threatened by them.

43:49.520 --> 43:52.480
How about we tell them what the best pasta is on our podcast?

43:52.480 --> 43:53.760
We got this with Mark and Hal.

43:53.760 --> 43:54.880
Oh, that's a great idea.

43:54.880 --> 43:55.760
Thank God.

43:55.760 --> 43:56.720
Tuesdays at nine?

43:56.720 --> 43:58.400
On MaximumFun.org.

43:58.400 --> 43:59.760
Hey, I love that show.

44:02.800 --> 44:04.720
Here comes the Unready Yahoo for you.

44:04.720 --> 44:05.360
I just picked it up.

44:06.240 --> 44:07.920
God, but I was-

44:07.920 --> 44:12.880
I was really excited.

44:12.880 --> 44:14.080
I want a munch!

44:14.080 --> 44:14.560
Squad!

44:17.440 --> 44:19.280
I want to munch!

44:19.280 --> 44:20.320
Squad!

44:20.320 --> 44:23.440
Are you trying not to wake somebody up because it was a very reserved-

44:23.440 --> 44:26.400
Nah, I'm just getting over a little bit of a bug.

44:26.400 --> 44:27.280
Welcome to Munch Squad.

44:27.280 --> 44:29.040
It's a podcast within a podcast.

44:30.480 --> 44:31.440
I do want to get-

44:33.600 --> 44:34.880
There's an elephant in the room.

44:34.880 --> 44:36.640
The elephant is shaped like nachos.

44:36.640 --> 44:37.680
Olive Garden.

44:37.680 --> 44:38.640
Yes, I know.

44:38.640 --> 44:40.320
There are nachos at Olive Garden.

44:40.320 --> 44:41.120
Justin!

44:42.000 --> 44:42.880
What's wrong, Griff?

44:44.160 --> 44:45.440
This is not what the-

44:45.440 --> 44:46.400
This is the worst-

44:46.400 --> 44:49.600
This is so much worse than Taco Bell doing fries.

44:49.600 --> 44:52.400
This is so much worse than that.

44:52.400 --> 44:54.240
But that's not what the episode's about today.

44:54.240 --> 44:58.080
I just want to mention, I know that, but they don't have the fucking guts.

44:58.640 --> 45:05.200
They don't have the guts to make a press release about

45:05.200 --> 45:12.960
their loaded pasta chips, which are chips made of pasta with stuff dumped on them.

45:12.960 --> 45:15.120
They don't have the guts to do a press release for it.

45:15.120 --> 45:20.000
This is just pasta they ruined, and now they're trying to find a way to get it out?

45:20.000 --> 45:21.920
It's extremely al dente.

45:21.920 --> 45:25.200
It's extremely al dente.

45:25.200 --> 45:26.480
It's Alfred dente.

45:27.200 --> 45:29.600
Cherry peppers in an Alfredo drizzle.

45:29.600 --> 45:31.600
Oh my god.

45:31.600 --> 45:35.840
It's chilling, but they don't have the guts to do a press release, so I can't do-

45:36.480 --> 45:38.800
Yeah, you have to send me a press release, folks.

45:38.800 --> 45:40.720
That's the only way this segment works.

45:40.720 --> 45:43.040
And I do have one here from Einstein Bros.

45:44.640 --> 45:50.560
They're the bros that make bagels, and they introduce breakfast-themed alarm tones.

45:52.640 --> 45:56.080
So Einstein Brothers, a place that sells bagels,

45:56.080 --> 46:04.240
announced the launch of Wake Up Tones for limited edition downloadable alarm tones

46:04.240 --> 46:11.120
that mimic morning breakfast essentials to help people wake up on the right side of the bed

46:11.120 --> 46:15.360
in time for the most important meal of the day, breakfast.

46:15.360 --> 46:28.080
Now, if you visit einsteinbros.com slash wake up, you can download the free mp3 alarm tone.

46:28.080 --> 46:34.800
Direct your mobile device, and you get a coupon for an egg sandwich.

46:34.800 --> 46:36.160
Now, here's the thing.

46:36.160 --> 46:43.440
So the consumer that this program is for is the consumer that is like,

46:43.440 --> 46:51.520
like, I really need the sound of bacon sizzling or coffee brewing to use as a very,

46:51.520 --> 46:58.480
I would assume, ineffective alarm, but I just don't know where to get the glossy mp3 file to upload.

46:58.480 --> 47:02.240
So what they're supposing here is that I'm going to go to-

47:02.240 --> 47:05.920
I'm going to type in the web address einsteinbros.com slash wake up.

47:05.920 --> 47:10.560
I want to pick from bacon, coffee, a rooster crowing, or eggs frying.

47:10.560 --> 47:14.800
I'm going to pick one of those mp3s to download.

47:14.800 --> 47:15.120
Yeah.

47:15.120 --> 47:21.520
Now, only one of those seems to me to be of alarm sound quality.

47:22.080 --> 47:27.040
I've never heard eggs frying and covered my ears and thought, oh, god, no, so loud.

47:27.040 --> 47:30.560
The ineffectiveness, I think, is what we're getting at there.

47:30.560 --> 47:32.480
I don't see how that would work very well.

47:32.480 --> 47:36.080
So this is a fun thing we can do because this is an audio program.

47:36.080 --> 47:40.640
Let's just play eggs frying right now just so we can have a conversation about it.

47:45.440 --> 47:46.640
Rise and shine.

47:46.640 --> 47:52.240
Sizzling bacon, fresh cracked eggs, and warm delicious bagels aren't going to eat themselves.

47:52.240 --> 47:53.680
Go ahead, get up.

47:53.680 --> 47:57.680
Let Einstein Brothers Bagels handle breakfast so you can handle your day.

47:58.480 --> 48:00.880
So there's a few problems here with eggs frying.

48:00.880 --> 48:05.280
The first is that the sound that starts off is quiet, not loud enough to wake you up.

48:05.280 --> 48:11.920
If it does wake you up, it also kind of sounds like the sound of, I don't know, drywall being

48:11.920 --> 48:18.240
ablaze, which is maybe not like, oh, god, oh, god, oh, god, smashed through the window

48:18.240 --> 48:23.840
every time your phone goes off because you think that a fire has taken the house.

48:24.400 --> 48:25.440
That's a challenge.

48:25.440 --> 48:31.360
The other challenge is the, I'm sorry, stranger who has wandered into your bedtime routine

48:31.360 --> 48:33.840
to yell at you about this bagel store.

48:33.840 --> 48:38.800
These eggs aren't going to eat themselves is maybe the weirdest phrase to use to wake

48:38.800 --> 48:39.440
someone up.

48:39.440 --> 48:44.080
And you know, if you're going to go that far to have a voice in it, why not just make

48:44.080 --> 48:48.000
that like, here's somebody telling you to get the fuck up.

48:48.000 --> 48:53.200
Like, that seems to me a more- this is not an eggs frying alarm clock.

48:53.200 --> 48:57.200
This is a human voice saying, hey, go eat some eggs.

48:57.200 --> 48:58.400
At Einstein Brothers.

48:58.400 --> 49:01.520
Can we just, can we just before, can we just sample coffee brewing?

49:01.520 --> 49:05.840
Yeah, I wanted to talk about coffee brewing also because there's a sound and it sounds

49:05.840 --> 49:07.040
a little like something else.

49:07.040 --> 49:08.080
And let's go ahead and tune in.

49:12.640 --> 49:13.520
Good morning.

49:13.520 --> 49:15.440
Time to conquer another day.

49:15.440 --> 49:20.480
Stop by Einstein Brothers Bagels for an incredible breakfast and cup of coffee to set your day

49:20.480 --> 49:21.600
up for success.

49:21.600 --> 49:22.320
You got this.

49:23.280 --> 49:24.000
Good morning.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.600
It's time to take a piss.

49:25.600 --> 49:27.680
It's definitely, I'm definitely already pissing.

49:27.680 --> 49:28.960
And guess what, pal?

49:28.960 --> 49:33.360
You are too, right now, because this is the sound you chose to woke up to today.

49:33.360 --> 49:40.720
Every so often in Munch Squad, I like, Justin will talk about a food and I will think who

49:40.720 --> 49:41.680
will want that.

49:41.680 --> 49:43.280
And then I think somebody.

49:43.280 --> 49:47.120
There's somebody who is experiencing some kind of food challenge.

49:47.120 --> 49:52.160
I myself just recently on Trends Like These, we were talking about a bagel place that for

49:52.160 --> 49:55.040
the Super Bowl was making a pretzel, excuse me, a big game.

49:55.040 --> 50:00.480
Tony was making a pretzel bagel with mint chocolate chip spread on it.

50:01.440 --> 50:01.920
Hell yeah.

50:01.920 --> 50:03.120
Yeah, it sounds really good.

50:03.120 --> 50:05.600
And here's the thing about this.

50:05.600 --> 50:12.800
I don't only wonder who would want these, but also like the amount of work you would

50:12.800 --> 50:16.000
have to go to to actually put these onto your phone.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.040
It would be tremendous.

50:17.040 --> 50:22.400
It would be a tremendous, it's a tremendous, hey listen, if you're a higher ranked member

50:22.400 --> 50:28.080
of the Schmear Society, which is actually a thing that they call their fans, I guess,

50:29.600 --> 50:30.960
it doesn't, you want this.

50:30.960 --> 50:34.400
You want these strangers to be the first voice that you hear in the morning.

50:34.400 --> 50:39.600
You want the sound of this hot, troubled piss to be the first thing that you hear in the

50:39.600 --> 50:42.960
morning, because you hear that hot, troubled piss and you think Einstein Brothers sounds

50:42.960 --> 50:43.920
pretty good right about now.

50:43.920 --> 50:51.760
You also, if they're, what if you were married and you, I think that's fair grounds for

50:51.760 --> 50:56.400
divorce, is like every morning my husband Jeffrey, who I love very much, wakes up to

50:56.400 --> 51:01.680
a piss alarm and then a man yells at him to go to Einstein Brothers.

51:01.680 --> 51:05.360
Let me just say, let me just say also, if you're the sort of person that would download

51:05.360 --> 51:10.160
an Einstein Brothers ringtone to serve as your alarm, you do not need a reminder to

51:10.160 --> 51:11.760
go to Einstein Brothers.

51:11.760 --> 51:16.560
I have to imagine that is your first fucking thought every day when you wake up, is I have

51:16.560 --> 51:19.120
got to get to Einstein Brothers right away.

51:19.120 --> 51:24.480
Now I think we have an opportunity here though, because they clearly missed the point here,

51:24.480 --> 51:25.520
Einstein Brothers did.

51:25.520 --> 51:29.680
But I mean, I think there's a lot of opportunity here and maybe we could just knock out a few

51:30.720 --> 51:32.400
wake up alarms for them.

51:32.400 --> 51:34.320
Like I have some coffee right here, so I could go like,

51:37.520 --> 51:41.360
hot damn, get your ass to Einstein's partner.

51:42.560 --> 51:45.120
That'll wake people up, I feel like.

51:45.120 --> 51:47.840
The sound is bad, doesn't sound like piss.

51:47.840 --> 51:48.560
Uh huh.

51:48.560 --> 51:52.400
And then the voice is just more of a command.

51:52.400 --> 51:53.680
That'll get your pants on.

51:53.680 --> 51:55.840
Let me see what foley stuff I have around here.

51:55.840 --> 51:56.960
Here, let me try this.

52:00.160 --> 52:04.960
A lot of paperwork at the office you gotta do, you better wake up good, just stop by

52:04.960 --> 52:05.520
outside.

52:05.520 --> 52:08.320
Try that again but yell it like louder, because it's not gonna, it's got a long.

52:08.320 --> 52:11.040
And try to make the paperwork sound less like farting.

52:11.040 --> 52:12.640
Yeah, it sounded a lot like a big toot.

52:13.200 --> 52:13.700
Okay.

52:13.700 --> 52:14.200
Okay.

52:17.540 --> 52:20.580
That paperwork isn't gonna complete itself.

52:20.580 --> 52:21.940
Louder, get louder at the end.

52:22.820 --> 52:23.320
Okay.

52:24.420 --> 52:26.660
Start off kind of quiet but then get louder.

52:26.660 --> 52:27.160
Okay.

52:30.500 --> 52:32.980
That paperwork isn't gonna do itself.

52:34.100 --> 52:35.700
Time to get some brothers.

52:35.700 --> 52:44.580
Bagels, coffee, they're not picky, you can have whatever you want at Einstein Brothers

52:44.580 --> 52:46.980
Bagels or other places that have bagels.

52:46.980 --> 52:48.020
I'm not getting a cut.

52:48.580 --> 52:52.820
My name is Enrique Iglesias and I recorded this voicemail just for you.

52:52.820 --> 52:53.320
Perfect.

52:53.780 --> 52:54.900
Was it a voicemail?

52:54.900 --> 52:56.740
It was a voicemail.

52:56.740 --> 53:03.060
Also leave a message, leave a message at the sound of the bacon.

53:03.060 --> 53:08.260
If you, if you are not a coward you will download these and make them your voicemail message.

53:10.900 --> 53:14.820
I was calling to talk to a human being but certainly I couldn't have reached that

53:14.820 --> 53:16.260
considering your voicemail message.

53:16.820 --> 53:17.320
Jesus.

53:18.260 --> 53:19.300
Let me try another one.

53:19.300 --> 53:20.340
Oh yeah, try just one more.

53:21.300 --> 53:26.980
Bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, Kevin Bacon.

53:27.780 --> 53:29.300
You've reached Kevin Bacon's phone?

53:29.300 --> 53:31.780
Leave a message at the numbers at the top, at the...

53:31.780 --> 53:32.740
Leave a message.

53:34.580 --> 53:36.580
If you know Kevin Bacon you can get that to him.

53:37.860 --> 53:39.140
So here's Yahoo.

53:39.140 --> 53:41.940
This one was sent in by level 9000 Yajur Jujur Davenport.

53:41.940 --> 53:46.820
We've done one similar to this before but it's, this one has some exciting sort of options for us.

53:46.820 --> 53:49.380
It's Yahoo Answers user...

53:49.380 --> 53:54.820
Orange Glow Ahoy asks, I need a catchphrase.

53:54.820 --> 53:55.320
Help.

53:56.420 --> 53:57.380
Here they is.

53:57.940 --> 53:58.440
One.

53:59.380 --> 54:00.580
I like a do what?

54:00.580 --> 54:01.380
I like a do what?

54:03.780 --> 54:04.280
Two.

54:04.820 --> 54:06.900
Oyster burger a palooza.

54:08.340 --> 54:08.840
Three.

54:09.700 --> 54:10.820
Hack it, why don't ya?

54:12.900 --> 54:13.700
End of options.

54:13.700 --> 54:16.100
So, I thought we could...

54:16.660 --> 54:23.700
We have a lot of great stuff here in the writers room and I figured we could just kind of weigh

54:23.700 --> 54:26.820
them because obviously it's got to be one of these three.

54:26.820 --> 54:30.980
I feel like this is the new sort of like personality test of what kind of person you are.

54:30.980 --> 54:35.700
Like hack it, why don't you just want to leave the party a little bit earlier than everybody else

54:35.700 --> 54:39.780
because they need to, you know, go home and recuperate some of their energy.

54:40.500 --> 54:45.940
Here's my question and I'm really trying to rack my brain for a catchphrase from a popular

54:46.500 --> 54:50.660
media thing that, I mean, maybe got me cheese.

54:51.780 --> 54:52.180
Question.

54:52.180 --> 54:54.900
I'm looking for a question catchphrase.

54:54.900 --> 54:57.940
What was the other catchphrase Trav that...

54:57.940 --> 55:00.420
I was trying to remember this last night because I was showing my daughter

55:01.700 --> 55:03.060
some Urkel clips on YouTube.

55:04.100 --> 55:07.780
What was the catchphrase that you identified that we didn't recognize?

55:07.780 --> 55:08.740
Not while I'm pouring?

55:08.740 --> 55:11.380
Not while I'm pouring.

55:11.380 --> 55:12.500
Yeah, that was a good...

55:12.500 --> 55:12.900
I forget.

55:12.900 --> 55:14.100
I want to watch that clip now.

55:14.100 --> 55:14.980
He had a lot of them.

55:15.540 --> 55:16.420
Yeah, it was almost like

55:16.980 --> 55:20.100
Urkel was purely written to just have catchphrases.

55:20.900 --> 55:22.020
It's weird, yeah.

55:22.020 --> 55:23.460
I like a do what?

55:23.460 --> 55:25.860
I like a do what is so good.

55:25.860 --> 55:27.620
Let's circle back to I like a do what.

55:27.620 --> 55:27.940
Okay.

55:27.940 --> 55:29.700
Because I think it has the most promise.

55:29.700 --> 55:38.100
Oysterburgerpalooza, the use case for that one is gonna be quite limited, I worry.

55:38.100 --> 55:42.180
Well, also, it's got a lot of hard syllables in it.

55:42.740 --> 55:46.180
Like, it doesn't exactly drip from the tongue.

55:46.180 --> 55:47.780
It's hard to say.

55:47.780 --> 55:48.420
Yeah.

55:48.420 --> 55:50.180
It takes a long time to say, too.

55:50.180 --> 55:53.300
People are gonna be tuning out in the middle of your catchphrase.

55:53.300 --> 55:57.140
Also, it's straight up dookie nonsense.

55:57.140 --> 55:59.620
And the other two are, yes, also that.

55:59.620 --> 56:03.060
But they at least form semi-coherent thoughts.

56:03.060 --> 56:06.740
Now, I actually see a lot of promise for hack it, why don't you?

56:06.740 --> 56:08.740
Because that seems like a good thing.

56:08.740 --> 56:10.260
Like, if somebody's complaining like,

56:10.980 --> 56:15.860
oh, I can't get my iPhone to connect to the...

56:15.860 --> 56:17.220
Well, hack it, why don't you?

56:17.220 --> 56:20.660
Because in this day and age of people trying to figure out constant life hacks.

56:20.660 --> 56:22.260
Oh, I see.

56:22.260 --> 56:24.740
Yeah, 10 things you didn't know your iPhone could do,

56:25.460 --> 56:27.380
that kind of like YouTube, you're just like,

56:27.380 --> 56:29.700
ugh, this guy, hack it, why don't you?

56:29.700 --> 56:32.740
And it could both be used to encourage someone

56:32.740 --> 56:34.740
to figure out how to use their device properly,

56:34.740 --> 56:36.500
but also it's kind of a snarky like,

56:36.500 --> 56:39.220
oh, why don't you just tell me about some life hacks?

56:39.220 --> 56:40.820
Just hack it, why don't you?

56:40.820 --> 56:42.660
I think it means like hack it, like...

56:43.460 --> 56:44.500
Yeah, that's how I read it.

56:44.500 --> 56:46.100
Like, oh, you just can't hack it.

56:46.100 --> 56:48.340
Oh, buddy, hack it, why don't you?

56:49.220 --> 56:52.100
But I do think Travis is right.

56:52.100 --> 56:54.500
And we're wrong, we're the wrong ones,

56:54.500 --> 56:57.140
because it could just be like,

56:57.140 --> 57:00.180
I'm having a lot of trouble getting big wins

57:00.180 --> 57:01.380
in PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.

57:01.380 --> 57:03.620
It's like, well, hack it, why don't you?

57:03.620 --> 57:07.380
Get some, look through walls, do some cheats on there.

57:07.380 --> 57:10.100
I get the appeal now of hack it, why don't you?

57:10.100 --> 57:11.940
But can I just offer this up?

57:13.140 --> 57:14.180
I like to do what?

57:14.180 --> 57:15.540
I like to do what?

57:15.540 --> 57:16.180
Here's what I like.

57:16.180 --> 57:17.220
It's so good.

57:17.220 --> 57:20.580
It's rare to find a catchphrase, as I said, that is a question.

57:20.580 --> 57:23.380
It's even rarer to find a catchphrase

57:23.380 --> 57:26.260
that is both a question and a response

57:26.260 --> 57:28.260
to something someone else has just said

57:28.900 --> 57:31.540
that is so specific that someone would be like,

57:31.540 --> 57:33.060
Travis, do you like crosswords?

57:33.060 --> 57:34.820
I like to do what?

57:34.820 --> 57:35.860
Crosswords.

57:35.860 --> 57:36.180
Yes.

57:36.820 --> 57:37.540
Yes, I do.

57:37.540 --> 57:38.340
Thank you for asking.

57:38.340 --> 57:40.660
Yes, thank you for reconfirming that.

57:41.220 --> 57:44.820
I got some good ones here though from Yahoo Answerage.

57:44.820 --> 57:45.940
Thank you, God, thank you.

57:45.940 --> 57:51.060
I want to thank God and Jesus, just my heaven friends,

57:51.060 --> 57:51.620
for this one.

57:51.620 --> 57:54.100
How much longer do we have on the Yahoo Answers, by the way?

57:54.100 --> 57:54.980
Do we have a timetable?

57:54.980 --> 57:57.780
Because they definitely killed Instant Messenger.

57:57.780 --> 57:58.100
Yeah.

57:58.100 --> 58:04.340
And like, I mean they and like the broad sense here.

58:04.340 --> 58:05.140
Kim Trails.

58:05.940 --> 58:08.740
Kim Trails, they killed it because they didn't have the guts.

58:10.580 --> 58:12.260
It can't have long, right?

58:12.260 --> 58:13.060
Probably not long.

58:13.060 --> 58:17.300
Probably not long, so let's gather our delicious rosebuds

58:17.300 --> 58:19.540
that we're going to eat like you do with rosebuds.

58:20.340 --> 58:22.020
Proflowers.com.

58:22.020 --> 58:24.660
Proflowers, they're the tastiest rosebuds.

58:24.660 --> 58:25.220
They're edible.

58:25.780 --> 58:27.460
Well, everything is, if you try hard enough.

58:27.460 --> 58:29.060
Yahoo Answers user question mark says,

58:29.780 --> 58:31.540
don't light your farts on a hayride.

58:31.540 --> 58:33.540
And again, the use case for this one.

58:34.260 --> 58:34.820
Narrow.

58:34.820 --> 58:38.580
It's more of a folksy idiom, I would say.

58:39.540 --> 58:41.860
Catchphrases have to be broadly applicable.

58:41.860 --> 58:44.260
I mean, the fact that, shh, not why I'm pouring,

58:44.260 --> 58:46.900
got as many uses as it did is kind of an anomaly.

58:48.020 --> 58:49.380
This user who's just an emoji,

58:49.380 --> 58:50.740
so I'm not going to try to pronounce that,

58:51.860 --> 58:53.220
says, eat my shorts.

58:53.220 --> 58:55.540
And it's a good one, but the problem with that is that

58:55.540 --> 58:57.220
it was already used.

58:57.220 --> 58:58.580
Well, just take it and turn it.

58:58.580 --> 58:59.780
Don't eat my shorts.

58:59.780 --> 59:01.940
Hey, stop eating my shorts.

59:01.940 --> 59:03.140
Stop eating my shorts.

59:03.140 --> 59:04.180
Again, the use case.

59:04.740 --> 59:07.620
No, you could use it if somebody kind of like

59:07.620 --> 59:08.980
don't blow smoke up my ass.

59:08.980 --> 59:10.500
It would be like, if someone was like, hey,

59:10.500 --> 59:11.780
I really think you're doing a great job.

59:11.780 --> 59:13.140
I'm like, listen, man, I don't need it.

59:13.140 --> 59:13.940
Stop eating my shorts.

59:13.940 --> 59:15.380
I don't need anybody eating my shorts right now.

59:16.900 --> 59:18.900
Smiley says-

59:18.900 --> 59:21.380
Someone eating my shorts is the last thing I need, okay?

59:22.740 --> 59:24.660
Don't eat my shorts and tell me it's a goat.

59:27.460 --> 59:29.060
Listen, people have been eating my shorts

59:29.060 --> 59:30.180
around here all morning.

59:30.180 --> 59:31.860
Just be straight with me, Doug.

59:31.860 --> 59:33.860
Is it a good presentation or not?

59:33.860 --> 59:35.140
Don't eat my shorts on this one.

59:35.140 --> 59:36.500
Hey, Valerie, we're all counting on you.

59:36.500 --> 59:37.700
Don't eat your shorts, okay?

59:37.700 --> 59:38.740
Just don't eat your shorts.

59:39.780 --> 59:40.580
This is your moment.

59:40.580 --> 59:41.620
You're the anchor here, okay?

59:41.620 --> 59:42.420
Don't eat your shorts.

59:42.420 --> 59:43.380
You're the anchor.

59:43.380 --> 59:45.860
This is your moment to shine at the big presentation.

59:45.860 --> 59:46.980
Don't eat your shorts.

59:46.980 --> 59:47.780
Go in there.

59:47.780 --> 59:49.460
You make them eat their shorts.

59:50.820 --> 59:53.380
14 seconds on the clock in the fourth period

59:53.380 --> 59:56.260
and Tom Brady just has wide open receivers

59:56.260 --> 59:58.740
and he really eats the shorts on this one, folks.

01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:01.860
I'm not going to eat my shorts.

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:03.060
I'm not going to eat my shorts.

01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:04.340
I'm not going to eat my shorts.

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:08.500
A big, stinky mouthful of shorts for Thomas Brady.

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:10.740
He's basically chewing the shorts at this point.

01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:14.420
Smiley says, winner, winner, chicken dinner.

01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:16.420
Or when you go out with friends to eat,

01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:19.220
when the bill comes, tell them you got the tip.

01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:20.820
Always wear clean underwear

01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:22.980
or look both ways when crossing the street.

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:25.140
That's like a routine.

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:27.460
It's not a catchphrase.

01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:28.660
And the best one here's from

01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:39.060
sportswithaz55 said, where did you buy those clothes?

01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:40.100
At the toilet store?

01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:44.740
It's a mean catchphrase,

01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:49.780
but I mean, some catchphrases are transgressive.

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:51.540
Well, now here's what's interesting about this.

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:55.540
I guess it could be considered a catchphrase,

01:00:55.540 --> 01:01:00.020
but it is also a joke from Anchorman

01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:03.620
in which someone is trying to make a joke in the movie

01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:05.380
and fails.

01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:06.260
Well, that's a good point.

01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:08.260
Can we just do more jokes from Anchorman

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:10.500
on our fucking podcast without realizing it?

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.180
Has it been long enough now?

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:14.180
I mean, shit, dude.

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:15.940
I ate the shorts hard on that one.

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:20.340
Oh, God.

01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:21.720
Damn it.

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.180
Now it's making me wonder how many other things

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:25.300
we ate the shorts on and said,

01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:30.820
like, an Anchorman thing throughout the last 392 episodes.

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:36.260
I mean, the jokes per minute in that film is a lot.

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:39.140
And so it's kind of, you kind of used them all up, I think.

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:41.060
Well, and also they use a lot of words in there

01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:42.740
that if we said, like, you know, coffee,

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:44.820
and it's like, oh, they said coffee once on Anchorman.

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:45.460
That was an Anchorman reference.

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:46.660
Yeah, I mean, we said coffee a lot

01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:49.300
when we were talking about the Einstein Brothers stupid thing.

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:51.220
And I think we said San Diego before.

01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:52.980
That's an Anchorman reference.

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:57.300
Damn it.

01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:58.180
Nanu Nanu.

01:01:58.180 --> 01:01:58.900
That's a good one.

01:01:58.900 --> 01:01:59.860
That's a good catchphrase.

01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:01.860
That's a good one because it's,

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:04.100
um, you can use it pretty much anytime

01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:05.940
that you don't have something different to say.

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:09.140
I don't think so is a good one,

01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:10.340
but you have to say it like that.

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:12.020
That's fine.

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:13.540
Because if you say, I don't think so,

01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:13.780
that's not a catchphrase.

01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:15.300
I like to do what?

01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:16.180
I like to do what?

01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:17.140
I like to do what?

01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:20.660
It does land.

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:21.620
It does land.

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:23.300
All right, let's end the episode.

01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:25.300
So that's the end of our show.

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:28.820
Hey, I'm doing the voice of a guy named Very Deadward

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:30.260
on a show called Slug Riot.

01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:35.380
And you can find that at vrv.co and search for Slug Riot.

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:38.260
It's a fun animated series about a guy

01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:39.620
who makes a mold core band.

01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:41.060
His sister tries to make him bring it back.

01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:41.460
It's fun.

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:42.500
The episode's like three minutes longer.

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:42.820
Check it out.

01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:43.380
You'll like it.

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:45.300
I destroyed my voice doing it.

01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:46.500
So please enjoy it.

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.220
Make it worth it.

01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:48.980
Yeah, make it worth it.

01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:50.500
Also, that's where you can find my brother.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:51.940
My brother and me to stream.

01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:53.220
If you want to watch the episodes

01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:55.700
and own them for your very own,

01:02:55.700 --> 01:03:00.580
you can do so now via Google Play or on iTunes.

01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:01.780
You can get them there.

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:04.660
And so thank you again to everybody who got that.

01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:09.380
And we take that to number one on the TV charts.

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:11.700
We put up a commentary for episode two

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:14.580
to thank everybody so you can hear the three of us

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:16.900
and director and showrunner J.D. Amato.

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:21.860
That's in just our regular My Brother, My Brother, and Me feed

01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:23.700
if you want to listen to the commentary

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:25.300
and watch the episode at the same time.

01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:27.620
I also want to say,

01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:31.940
so I put together a secret society show here in Cincinnati.

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:34.340
It's not so secret anymore if you're talking about it.

01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:35.620
Well, here's what it is.

01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:37.140
I'm going to tell you where it is,

01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:38.660
when it is, and how to get tickets.

01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:41.380
But the guests are a secret mystery.

01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:42.740
I can tell you right now,

01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:46.740
I've got six amazing guests that I know who they are

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:49.140
and it's pretty good.

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:50.260
You did a pretty good job.

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:52.100
And I'm also pretty excited to say

01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:53.940
it's already three quarters of the way sold out

01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:57.300
and we're still about two months away from the show.

01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:58.340
So it has allowed us to go ahead

01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:00.740
and start planning for the show for April two.

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:04.180
And so I'm hoping that this will become an every month thing

01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:05.780
and it seems like people are into it.

01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:08.740
It's the Cincinnati Underground Society Show.

01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:11.140
If you want to get tickets, they're $15.

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:13.780
And once we cover the expenses,

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:16.580
50% of profits are going to go towards next month's show.

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:18.340
And the other 50%, I'm going to donate

01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:19.860
to a local Cincinnati charity.

01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:24.820
You can get tickets at bit.ly forward slash cussmarch.

01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:28.500
C-U-S-S-M-A-R-C-H, because it is the March show.

01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:30.900
And I'm also working,

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:34.420
you might've seen the great logo made by Justin Russo.

01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:37.780
And I'm also working on some like enamel pins

01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:38.900
and stuff for the show.

01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:41.060
And profits from that will also go to the charity.
