00:00.000 --> 00:07.680
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:07.680 --> 00:14.880
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:14.880 --> 00:24.160
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:24.160 --> 00:30.160
What's up, you cool baby?

00:54.160 --> 01:12.880
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, main advice show for the modern era, I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:12.880 --> 01:20.240
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

01:20.240 --> 01:29.040
And I'm your sweet baby brother, and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

01:29.040 --> 01:34.640
That was pretty even, thank you.

01:34.640 --> 01:36.640
Good balance, everyone.

01:36.640 --> 01:46.160
I assume when everyone screams as loud as they possibly can, it all works out the same, because there's a cap on pure human joy.

01:46.160 --> 01:54.800
Do you want to clarify before we go on, you may be looking at me and think, did Travis change clothes between shanners?

01:54.800 --> 01:57.440
No, this shirt is reversible.

01:57.440 --> 02:01.920
I just want to make that clear.

02:01.920 --> 02:05.440
He called Levi's and he's like, I'm doing two in a row, is there anything you can do for me?

02:05.440 --> 02:07.440
And those fucking fashion wizards.

02:07.440 --> 02:09.440
They did it.

02:09.440 --> 02:12.400
I feel very good.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.400
Yeah!

02:14.400 --> 02:16.400
And you may be asking, why?

02:16.400 --> 02:18.400
Is it the energy of Nashville?

02:18.400 --> 02:20.400
Is it to our life?

02:20.400 --> 02:22.400
Is it just that we've gotten good at this?

02:22.400 --> 02:32.400
Is it the excitement of Nashville crowds, which I tell everyone are the best crowds in the world?

02:32.400 --> 02:34.400
It's not.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.400
It's not that.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.400
It's salad, baby.

02:38.400 --> 02:42.400
You're looking at three genuine salad boys.

02:42.400 --> 02:46.400
Oh, and I know what you're thinking.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.400
Certainly someone made them get salad.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.400
Nope.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.400
Or did it on their own?

02:52.400 --> 02:54.400
Completely voluntary.

02:54.400 --> 02:58.400
This is not a cookie points transaction or investment situation.

02:58.400 --> 03:04.400
This was three adults who said, do you know what would be good for my human body?

03:04.400 --> 03:06.400
Right.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.400
Salad.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.400
And everyone in the room went, oh.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.400
We've been on the road for two days.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.400
It's taken a serious toll.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.400
You're joking.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.400
I'm not.

03:18.400 --> 03:22.400
Road Griffin makes choices that home Griffin would not.

03:22.400 --> 03:32.400
This morning I had two big, big muffins, a bag of Skittles, and a whole can of Pringles before 10 a.m.

03:32.400 --> 03:40.400
If I was sitting in my living room watching Teen Titans go with my child and wife,

03:40.400 --> 03:44.400
I would not say, you know what would be good breakfast?

03:44.400 --> 03:46.400
It would not involve Skittles and a whole can of Pringles.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.400
I can guarantee you that much.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.400
Now, I don't know about you guys.

03:50.400 --> 03:56.400
I don't want to speak for you, but the sort of arc that I went on this evening was intellectually saying,

03:56.400 --> 03:58.400
I should have a salad.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.400
The poops have been strange today.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.400
And then intellectually saying that.

04:02.400 --> 04:06.400
And then when dinner arrived, I went on a spike like this, oh, hell yeah, dinner.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.400
And then I was like, ah, shit.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.400
That's right.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.400
I got a salad.

04:12.400 --> 04:16.400
But then at my lowest point, which was one of the worst things to ever happen to me,

04:16.400 --> 04:20.400
because I could have gotten anything and I did get salad.

04:20.400 --> 04:28.400
As I started to eat it, my body was like fucking Wesley and Buttercup emerging from the lightning sands.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.400
Oh, thank God.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.400
Vitamins, nutrients, thank you.

04:32.400 --> 04:34.400
The amazing thing about this is I actually.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.400
Wait, hold on.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.400
That was really funny.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.400
Just let him finish laughing.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.400
Now, okay.

04:42.400 --> 04:46.400
I experienced the exact inverse of this this afternoon, Griffin and I.

04:46.400 --> 04:50.400
Travis made some fucking decisions at Puckett's.

04:50.400 --> 04:56.400
I went to Puckett's and I ordered for appetizers.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.400
No, F-O-R.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.400
But I did.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.400
And F-O-U-R, actually.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.400
F-O-U-R for appetizers.

05:04.400 --> 05:08.400
I got fried green beans, fried green tomatoes, fried pickles.

05:08.400 --> 05:12.400
And then we also got the sausage and cheese.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.400
He did that.

05:14.400 --> 05:18.400
He ordered that trio of literally everything in the appetizers menu that said fried on it.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.400
And I instinctively went like, holy fuck.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.400
And I said this out loud in a restaurant I've never been to.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.400
No shit.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.400
I ordered those three things.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.400
Rapid fire.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.400
The server went, wow.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.400
She actually said, awesome.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.400
It was probably the first time.

05:34.400 --> 05:38.400
And so I was very excited spiritually to order these things.

05:38.400 --> 05:48.400
And then I started consuming them in my body like the other father in Coraline just like melted.

05:48.400 --> 05:52.400
My body started to consume this earthly decadence.

05:52.400 --> 05:56.400
What we are saying is that these were prescription salads.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.400
These were medicinal salads.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.400
So this is an advice show.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.400
And what does that mean?

06:02.400 --> 06:04.400
Well, we tell you what to do.

06:04.400 --> 06:08.400
Now, if you've never listened to this before and you've just heard this bit, you might be thinking,

06:08.400 --> 06:12.400
I probably shouldn't do what they tell me to do.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.400
Chase that instinct.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.400
Follow that.

06:16.400 --> 06:18.400
Don't lose sight of that.

06:18.400 --> 06:22.400
Let's hear from someone who supposedly is in the audience tonight.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.400
Supposedly.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.400
A lot of liars listen to our show.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.400
We'll see.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.400
I don't know. Plans change.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.400
Sure.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.400
I don't know what would be more important.

06:34.400 --> 06:36.400
Life finds a way.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.400
Let's read the advice question.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.400
I'm trying to.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.400
You guys are talking.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.400
I'm a poor college kid working the graveyard shift in a big office building.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.400
During the night, many of the office floors aren't used.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.400
I'll hide on money.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.400
I'll grab some of the food from the other floor's fridges.

06:50.400 --> 06:54.400
Most being from corporate lunches, not personal lunch boxes.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.400
Am I good?

06:56.400 --> 06:58.400
This isn't stealing, technically, right?

06:58.400 --> 07:00.400
What do I say if someone catches me one night?

07:00.400 --> 07:02.400
And that's from raccooning in Kentucky.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.400
And you said most.

07:04.400 --> 07:06.400
Yeah, that's a critical most.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.400
I'm going to rewind that most.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.400
I steal food.

07:10.400 --> 07:14.400
Most being from corporate lunches, not personal lunch boxes.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.400
So you said most.

07:16.400 --> 07:22.400
So, like, usually, but sometimes, it's Gerald's lasagna.

07:22.400 --> 07:28.400
And now that we've voided out your evil, are you here?

07:28.400 --> 07:30.400
Yes, yes, yes, you are here.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.400
Okay.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.400
You're just a little sheepish about it, and I get it.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.400
Is Gerald here?

07:36.400 --> 07:38.400
Because we got the guy.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.400
We got him.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.400
We got him, Gerald.

07:42.400 --> 07:44.400
We got him.

07:44.400 --> 07:48.400
You know the thing I love about Gerald's lasagna?

07:48.400 --> 07:50.400
What's that, Justin?

07:50.400 --> 07:54.400
The cheese is so nice and bubbly, and his mom made it for him.

07:54.400 --> 07:58.400
And also, it's Gerald's, and not yours.

07:58.400 --> 08:04.400
The cheese tastes great, and the fact that you're depriving Gerald of his motherly gift is...

08:04.400 --> 08:08.400
I've always said lasagna stolen is sweeter than lasagna earned.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.400
Indeed, Travis, indeed.

08:10.400 --> 08:18.400
I've never heard the question phrased, this isn't technically stealing right, where the answer was, yeah, you're fine.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.400
Right.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.400
Because what it should be, it's actually the reverse is true.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.400
It is technically stealing.

08:24.400 --> 08:28.400
You are taking something that's not yours and making it yours.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.400
That's stealing.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.400
But what you're asking is, what isn't stealing?

08:32.400 --> 08:40.400
You also used the term raccooning to refer to yourself, and nobody's ever seen a raccoon going through their garbage or picnic basket and thought like, aw, tight.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.400
Right.

08:42.400 --> 08:46.400
Aw, thank God, now I don't have to worry about that sandwich I was gonna eat.

08:46.400 --> 08:52.400
Right, no one ever sees a raccoon combing their yard and thinks, man, I hope he found the rotten turkey I saved for him in my trash.

08:52.400 --> 08:56.400
Like, you didn't save it for the raccoon, the raccoon is taking what they want.

08:56.400 --> 09:01.400
But it's not even that, because like, this isn't food someone was discarding.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.400
Indeed, true.

09:03.400 --> 09:05.400
They were saving it for later, and you said, no you're not.

09:05.400 --> 09:07.400
Well, maybe.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.400
You were saving it for me.

09:09.400 --> 09:17.400
Maybe the Quiznos party platter was a little bit too much party than this office can handle, and it would end up in the dumpster.

09:17.400 --> 09:28.400
That's what I'm saying, I think there's an arc that goes through when you're buying food in bulk, and you bought too much, and there's like, one of the containers of like, soup doesn't get even opened.

09:28.400 --> 09:32.400
You feel really bad about it, and you're like, I'm gonna save this and figure out something to do with it.

09:32.400 --> 09:38.400
And then the fridge does its grim work, and a week later, it is trash, like, oh, I gotta throw this away.

09:38.400 --> 09:45.400
And you can feel great about it, because the fridge sort of babysat, like, the fridge is sometimes like food hospice.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.400
It's a trash incubator, is what you're saying.

09:47.400 --> 09:57.400
The fridge, carefully, gradually, lovingly, and in an appropriate setting, where family are welcome, shepherds the food to death.

09:57.400 --> 10:06.400
And then you can feel great about throwing it away, because, well, it's done its job, and I didn't throw it away when it was good and edible.

10:06.400 --> 10:12.400
So what was the question?

10:12.400 --> 10:15.400
I think it's a victimless crime, except Gerald.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.400
Gerald is a victim.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.400
Gerald has been victimized.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.400
Otherwise, I think you're good.

10:19.400 --> 10:22.400
It's just, it's corporate food.

10:22.400 --> 10:25.400
Steal from, eat the rich's sandwiches.

10:25.400 --> 10:29.400
I guess what I'm saying.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.400
That is a power move.

10:31.400 --> 10:35.400
If you're like, hey, CEO, your pastrami was great.

10:35.400 --> 10:36.400
But you don't say it.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.400
Oh, don't say it.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.400
But you know it.

10:39.400 --> 10:46.400
How about a Yahoo from the great Yahoo Answers service?

10:46.400 --> 10:48.400
This one was sent in by Gina Invieri.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.400
Thank you, Gina.

10:49.400 --> 11:13.400
It's by Yahoo Answers user Morgan, who asks, how do I sell a single potato?

11:13.400 --> 11:19.400
I managed to grow only one big potato in my yard.

11:19.400 --> 11:21.400
Just wondering where I could sell it.

11:21.400 --> 11:22.400
How much can I get for it?

11:22.400 --> 11:28.400
The type is a King Edward potato.

11:28.400 --> 11:37.400
You know, it's wild to me that you would work all that time and get one potato, and your first thought is, I gotta sell this bad boy.

11:37.400 --> 11:40.400
Like, did you, you really didn't want a potato, huh?

11:40.400 --> 11:44.400
Because you just got one, and you're like, I have to divest myself with this potato.

11:44.400 --> 11:51.400
The skill level of your horticulture game is not apparently awesome, because you only got the one.

11:51.400 --> 11:56.400
I can't imagine it's the most luscious potato ever grown.

11:56.400 --> 11:59.400
To be fair, they do say one big potato.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.400
How big?

12:01.400 --> 12:05.400
I mean, if you let a potato grow, it can get, as far as I understand, infinitely large.

12:05.400 --> 12:13.400
Perhaps they are amazing, they have a really green thumb, but this one big potato consumed all the other smaller potatoes.

12:13.400 --> 12:17.400
Yes, it's an Akira potato!

12:17.400 --> 12:22.400
I feel bad for this cat the first time they saw The Martian, though.

12:22.400 --> 12:25.400
Because, like, that's gotta be demoralizing, huh?

12:25.400 --> 12:37.400
He grew that, this guy went to space, grew potatoes in his shit from nothing on space in Mars, and then he got, like, enough to live forever on them.

12:37.400 --> 12:43.400
This guy did one in his yard, with presumably potato food and special seed.

12:43.400 --> 12:45.400
Where potatoes belong.

12:45.400 --> 12:52.400
The Martian benefited, those potatoes benefited from having Matt Damon's dookie all over them.

12:52.400 --> 12:56.400
Which is, as we all know, the most wonderful fertilizer around.

12:56.400 --> 13:04.400
He might also have been disheartened just because he's a really big Matt Damon fan, and the idea of Matt Damon being trapped on Mars really fucked him out.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.400
Because he can't make a lot of movies up there.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.400
Just the one.

13:08.400 --> 13:13.400
Yeah, everything you just said made a lot of sense, to me.

13:13.400 --> 13:26.400
Here's the thing, you can't go to a farmer's market, and somebody walks up to your booth, and you have one potato sitting on some sort of column with a velvet cloth on it, with a spotlight shining down on the potato.

13:26.400 --> 13:33.400
Like you're a fucking, like, vendor in Legend of Zelda, like, 90 rupees for my only potato.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.400
Sold out, bye, we'll never talk again.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.400
You're wrong, Griffin, and let me tell you why.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.400
Let me tell you why you're incorrect.

13:39.400 --> 13:44.400
What people love these days, farm to table, locally sourced, small batch.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.400
Yeah.

13:46.400 --> 13:58.400
Imagine if you were walking through a farmer's market, and someone caught your attention and said, would you like to be the only human to ever eat one of my potatoes?

13:58.400 --> 14:05.400
Because you could, you could, like, the next day, like, be talking to your friends, like, I mean, I had the most amazing potato last night, and they said, oh, that sounds great, we're gonna get one.

14:05.400 --> 14:06.400
Prove it.

14:06.400 --> 14:07.400
And you're like, you can't.

14:07.400 --> 14:08.400
You can't.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.400
It was mine.

14:10.400 --> 14:14.400
I call them Bo-tatoes, and yes, as you've guessed, my name is Bo.

14:14.400 --> 14:15.400
Ah.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.400
And it's the one, it's the only one.

14:17.400 --> 14:18.400
I'll ever grow in my life.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.400
This is a bespoke potato.

14:20.400 --> 14:25.400
As you can see, I wrote 2017 on it to help me remember that this is my, this year's potato.

14:25.400 --> 14:28.400
You just take small slices off it every day?

14:28.400 --> 14:30.400
A potato this good, you don't eat how it was.

14:30.400 --> 14:33.400
Yeah, this is Bo to table, and I made it just for you.

14:33.400 --> 14:36.400
Apparently, if you buy it, it's $35.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.400
I know you're asking, is it magical?

14:38.400 --> 14:41.400
Will it make a big potato stalk into the heavens?

14:41.400 --> 14:46.400
I can't legally say yes, but my lawyers have been very clear.

14:46.400 --> 14:50.400
Also, they've made some very competitive bids for the potato.

14:50.400 --> 14:53.400
You should act fast.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.400
How about another question, Justin?

14:55.400 --> 15:00.400
Okay, gotcha.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.400
Hello, my, I was locked.

15:02.400 --> 15:03.400
Hello, brothers.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.400
It wasn't.

15:04.400 --> 15:07.400
I was up there, you saw I was lying, and I just spaced out for a second.

15:07.400 --> 15:12.400
But for you down here, the illusion was perfect.

15:12.400 --> 15:18.400
See, you thought you had bad seats, but apparently you had the fucking investigative seats up there.

15:18.400 --> 15:21.400
Where you can catch me in all my dirty tricks.

15:21.400 --> 15:24.400
Anyway, and stop reading ahead.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.400
It's very small down here.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.400
You can't see, but it's very small.

15:28.400 --> 15:30.400
The tight, I'm having a hard time actually.

15:30.400 --> 15:31.400
Yeah.

15:31.400 --> 15:34.400
Do you think the salad's turning on you in some way?

15:34.400 --> 15:37.400
Oh, God, you washed the salad before you ate it, right, Justin?

15:37.400 --> 15:38.400
Dun, dun, dun.

15:38.400 --> 15:39.400
Hello, brothers.

15:39.400 --> 15:43.400
With candle lights fast approaching, my mother gave me some diamond earrings to give to my

15:43.400 --> 15:45.400
fiancé, because she does not wear them anymore.

15:45.400 --> 15:48.400
Somebody in the audience went, mmm.

15:48.400 --> 15:52.400
And wanted for me to pass them down through the family.

15:52.400 --> 15:57.400
My question is, should I tell her that they were nice earrings that my mother wanted me

15:57.400 --> 16:00.400
to give her?

16:00.400 --> 16:04.400
Let me, yes.

16:04.400 --> 16:11.400
Or, can I pretend that I spent money on real diamond earrings?

16:11.400 --> 16:15.400
For one of the best candle lights gifts ever, that's from Candle Lights Confused in Coopersville

16:15.400 --> 16:18.400
and you're not confused.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.400
That's not what that word means.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.400
You know the answer already.

16:22.400 --> 16:25.400
What is your fucking long game here?

16:25.400 --> 16:27.400
Are you here?

16:27.400 --> 16:32.400
You can't, yes, good chase, also chase that instinct to not identify yourself.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.400
You may be here with me.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.400
This is how this vignette plays out.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.400
Honey, Merry Christmas.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.400
Oh, these are beautiful.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.400
Pop, pop, puts them in.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.400
Thank you, honey.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.400
Mom walks in room.

16:44.400 --> 16:48.400
Oh, I see you got the earrings I gave my son to give you.

16:48.400 --> 16:49.400
Boom, wedding's off.

16:49.400 --> 16:50.400
Yeah.

16:50.400 --> 16:54.400
There's only one answer and I'm certain you've already guessed it.

16:54.400 --> 17:00.400
If your head's stuck in 2015, you got to bring your mom in on the grift.

17:00.400 --> 17:04.400
Hey, can your mom hang?

17:04.400 --> 17:05.400
Mom, I have a grift?

17:05.400 --> 17:07.400
No, I told you I was out.

17:07.400 --> 17:08.400
I'm out.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.400
I ran my last one.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.400
Once you were born, I was out of the game.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.400
It got too hot.

17:13.400 --> 17:17.400
We lost too much on the Biloxi job.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.400
Hey, Dylan, I love your new girlfriend.

17:19.400 --> 17:26.400
She's really nice and we have similar interests and she seems like a fucking patsy.

17:26.400 --> 17:30.400
I'm going to take her down.

17:30.400 --> 17:31.400
Seems like an easy mark.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.400
Are you bringing Susan to Thanksgiving?

17:33.400 --> 17:34.400
That chump?

17:34.400 --> 17:36.400
That fucking chump.

17:36.400 --> 17:39.400
Does she own any land we could...

17:39.400 --> 17:41.400
Keep the con going.

17:41.400 --> 17:42.400
We're just getting started.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.400
We're in too deep, Dylan.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.400
You can't back out on me now.

17:46.400 --> 17:52.400
The danger, of course, is that your mom gets deep in the grift and then she can't get out the grift.

17:52.400 --> 17:57.400
And then it's like every two weeks she's texting you, like, found another fucking mark.

17:57.400 --> 17:58.400
This guy's such an idiot.

17:58.400 --> 18:01.400
He works with me at Amazon.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.400
Zebra and Accounting just got an inheritance.

18:03.400 --> 18:07.400
I've got another pair of diamond earrings.

18:07.400 --> 18:09.400
Oh, this must have just slipped right off your ears.

18:09.400 --> 18:10.400
How would that work?

18:10.400 --> 18:11.400
Yeah.

18:11.400 --> 18:13.400
Mom, is that a gun?

18:13.400 --> 18:15.400
Are you carrying a gun all the time now?

18:15.400 --> 18:17.400
It's just...

18:17.400 --> 18:18.400
It's hot out there.

18:18.400 --> 18:19.400
It's hot out there, you know.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.400
What?

18:20.400 --> 18:21.400
Get hot out there.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.400
How...

18:22.400 --> 18:23.400
We've got to change the subject.

18:23.400 --> 18:24.400
Also, are you hungry?

18:24.400 --> 18:26.400
Do you want a sandwich?

18:26.400 --> 18:28.400
First one's free.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.400
Oh, no.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.400
I lost who sent this.

18:31.400 --> 18:32.400
Yahoo in.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.400
I'm going to find it by Googling.

18:34.400 --> 18:35.400
It's also by Gina Enviere.

18:35.400 --> 18:36.400
Thank you, Gina.

18:36.400 --> 18:41.400
It's Yahoo Answers user Paul T. asks,

18:41.400 --> 18:46.400
how does wearing khaki pants make you feel?

18:46.400 --> 18:51.400
Should I have said that like more breathy, like...

18:51.400 --> 18:55.400
How does wearing khaki pants make you feel?

18:55.400 --> 18:56.400
I can tell you...

18:56.400 --> 18:58.400
How does it feel?

18:58.400 --> 19:05.400
I can tell you how it makes me feel.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.400
Like I'm ready for anything,

19:07.400 --> 19:10.400
because you can get out into the jungles

19:10.400 --> 19:11.400
and have khaki pants.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.400
You can go to a nice dinner and have khaki pants.

19:14.400 --> 19:15.400
Those are the two things.

19:15.400 --> 19:16.400
Not the same...

19:16.400 --> 19:17.400
I have to...

19:17.400 --> 19:20.400
I'm almost done cutting through these branches,

19:20.400 --> 19:23.400
and then I'm going to go have a nice burger.

19:23.400 --> 19:26.400
At Applebee's.

19:26.400 --> 19:27.400
Yeah.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.400
When you wear...

19:28.400 --> 19:29.400
Say they're flexible garments.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.400
Khaki is the bridge pant, right?

19:31.400 --> 19:34.400
It takes you from maybe I'm going to mow the lawn

19:34.400 --> 19:36.400
to maybe I've got to attend

19:36.400 --> 19:38.400
some kind of fancy religious ceremony.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.400
Khaki pants go from day to evening, exactly, Travis.

19:40.400 --> 19:41.400
Thank you.

19:41.400 --> 19:42.400
Yeah.

19:42.400 --> 19:44.400
That's why you always see James Bond in them.

19:44.400 --> 19:48.400
I mean...

19:48.400 --> 19:51.400
I like your pleat, Mr. Bond.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.400
They don't go from day to evening

19:53.400 --> 19:55.400
as much as they go from your house

19:55.400 --> 20:01.400
to your shift at Best Buy.

20:01.400 --> 20:04.400
99% of my khaki wearing took place

20:04.400 --> 20:07.400
at some sort of retail job where it was required.

20:07.400 --> 20:11.400
And by the way, I only had the one pair of khakis, by the way.

20:11.400 --> 20:14.400
So if you saw me, it wasn't for a fancy event,

20:14.400 --> 20:17.400
because those boys were probably not so...

20:17.400 --> 20:18.400
Bad boys.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.400
Probably a bad stink.

20:20.400 --> 20:23.400
I've always called khaki pants the shrug of pants.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.400
He always says that.

20:24.400 --> 20:25.400
He says that all the time.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.400
Because when you put on khaki pants,

20:27.400 --> 20:30.400
you're basically going, I don't know, pants?

20:30.400 --> 20:35.400
There are very few situations where khakis would be in a...

20:35.400 --> 20:37.400
Either if you go to something casual,

20:37.400 --> 20:39.400
it's like, well, look at you.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.400
Dressed up, huh? Khakis.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.400
And then if you're at a funeral, it's like,

20:43.400 --> 20:45.400
oh, look at you, thank you for coming.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.400
Because they wouldn't mention it.

20:47.400 --> 20:48.400
Because it's a funeral.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.400
What are you thinking?

20:49.400 --> 20:51.400
We're all going to miss Greg so much.

20:51.400 --> 20:52.400
But also...

20:52.400 --> 20:53.400
But also, sweet pants.

20:53.400 --> 20:54.400
Nice khakis.

20:54.400 --> 20:55.400
Thank you.

20:55.400 --> 20:56.400
He would have loved those.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.400
How I feel when I wear khakis

20:58.400 --> 21:01.400
is constantly worried I'm about to drop chocolate on them.

21:01.400 --> 21:02.400
Yeah.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.400
You don't get that with a G.

21:04.400 --> 21:05.400
I don't.

21:05.400 --> 21:06.400
I've never...

21:06.400 --> 21:08.400
If I'm wearing jeans and I drop something on them,

21:08.400 --> 21:09.400
it's like, I'll wash these.

21:09.400 --> 21:10.400
Drink it, soak it in.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.400
Yeah, that's what jeans are for.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.400
Jeans catch that stuff, lick it up and love it,

21:14.400 --> 21:15.400
and they just look better.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.400
You get one drop of khaki...

21:17.400 --> 21:19.400
Maybe that's why Best Buy and Associated Retailers,

21:19.400 --> 21:20.400
by which I mean all of them,

21:20.400 --> 21:22.400
want you to wear khakis,

21:22.400 --> 21:24.400
because they can tell if you're a sloppy boy.

21:24.400 --> 21:25.400
Yeah.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.400
If you're getting into some nasty stuff,

21:27.400 --> 21:28.400
they can keep tabs on you.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.400
I will say the other side of that is true, though.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.400
Because if I worked with someone at Best Buy

21:32.400 --> 21:34.400
and their pants stayed perfectly crisp and clean

21:34.400 --> 21:36.400
at the end of the day, I'm like, you're not living.

21:36.400 --> 21:37.400
You're not doing anything.

21:37.400 --> 21:38.400
You're not doing it.

21:38.400 --> 21:39.400
Get out there.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.400
Make some mistakes.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.400
At Best Buy?

21:41.400 --> 21:42.400
Well...

21:42.400 --> 21:44.400
Like what?

21:44.400 --> 21:46.400
I mean, you're basically talking about steely DVDs.

21:46.400 --> 21:49.400
It's all you mean.

21:49.400 --> 21:50.400
Yeah.

21:50.400 --> 21:51.400
Yeah.

21:51.400 --> 21:52.400
Okay.

21:52.400 --> 21:53.400
That's fine.

21:53.400 --> 21:54.400
I got another question.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.400
Here, let me get it open.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.400
Now it is really locked.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.400
This time...

21:57.400 --> 21:58.400
Thank you, Griffin.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.400
Thank you for having my back

21:59.400 --> 22:01.400
for fucking once in our miserable lives.

22:01.400 --> 22:02.400
I really appreciate you.

22:02.400 --> 22:03.400
Not combative.

22:03.400 --> 22:04.400
Okay, here it comes.

22:04.400 --> 22:05.400
He closed it.

22:05.400 --> 22:06.400
I didn't close it.

22:06.400 --> 22:07.400
It's the new iOS.

22:07.400 --> 22:08.400
Did it.

22:08.400 --> 22:09.400
We still live at home,

22:09.400 --> 22:10.400
as does our 87-year-old grandmother.

22:10.400 --> 22:11.400
We live in harmony.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.400
That's nice.

22:12.400 --> 22:13.400
For the most part.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.400
Don't most people live at home?

22:14.400 --> 22:15.400
Fair.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.400
My gran...

22:16.400 --> 22:17.400
But, uh...

22:17.400 --> 22:18.400
But, uh...

22:18.400 --> 22:19.400
Uh...

22:19.400 --> 22:20.400
Uh...

22:20.400 --> 22:21.400
Uh...

22:21.400 --> 22:22.400
Uh...

22:22.400 --> 22:23.400
Uh...

22:23.400 --> 22:24.400
Uh...

22:24.400 --> 22:25.400
Uh...

22:25.400 --> 22:26.400
Uh...

22:26.400 --> 22:27.400
Uh...

22:27.400 --> 22:28.400
Uh...

22:28.400 --> 22:29.400
Uh...

22:29.400 --> 22:31.400
Uh...

22:31.400 --> 22:32.400
Uh...

22:32.400 --> 22:33.400
Uh...

22:33.400 --> 22:34.400
Uh...

22:34.400 --> 22:35.400
Uh...

22:35.400 --> 22:36.400
Uh...

22:36.400 --> 22:37.400
Uh...

22:37.400 --> 22:38.400
Uh...

22:38.400 --> 22:39.400
Uh...

22:39.400 --> 22:40.400
Uh...

22:40.400 --> 22:41.400
Uh...

22:41.400 --> 22:42.400
Uh...

22:42.400 --> 22:43.400
Uh...

22:43.400 --> 22:44.400
Uh...

22:44.400 --> 22:45.400
Uh...

22:45.400 --> 22:46.400
Uh...

22:46.400 --> 22:47.400
Uh...

22:47.400 --> 22:48.400
Uh...

22:48.400 --> 22:49.400
Uh...

22:49.400 --> 22:50.400
Uh...

22:50.400 --> 22:51.400
Uh...

22:51.400 --> 22:52.400
Uh...

22:52.400 --> 22:53.400
Uh...

22:53.400 --> 22:54.400
Uh...

22:54.400 --> 22:55.400
Uh...

22:55.400 --> 22:56.400
Uh...

22:56.400 --> 22:57.400
Uh...

22:57.400 --> 22:58.400
Uh...

22:58.400 --> 23:05.760
She also chooses to have every conversation in a whisper from about two inches from your face.

23:05.760 --> 23:10.360
She'll sneak up behind us and whisper things like,

23:10.360 --> 23:20.240
there's ham in the bottom drawer or do we need some more toothpaste?

23:20.240 --> 23:27.360
Our home is turning into a jump scare factory and it's only a matter of time before she scares one

23:27.360 --> 23:32.360
of us so bad we come out swinging.

23:32.360 --> 23:36.120
Fucking hair trigger, man, it's your grandma, all right?

23:36.120 --> 23:37.000
Pump the brakes.

23:37.000 --> 23:42.320
There is no court of law that will let you go for that, you realize, right?

23:42.320 --> 23:44.000
Well, she scared me so bad.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.520
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it scared them.

23:46.520 --> 23:49.280
That's from should we put a bell on our grandma?

23:49.280 --> 23:50.800
All so bad.

23:50.800 --> 23:52.960
Neither of these things are acceptable.

23:52.960 --> 23:56.920
And that's from should we put a bell on our grandma and please say no

23:56.920 --> 23:59.560
from Beckley West, by God, Virginia.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.160
What's up?

24:01.160 --> 24:01.880
Are you here?

24:01.880 --> 24:03.320
Currently chilling in Nashville.

24:03.320 --> 24:04.520
Yeah, what's up?

24:04.520 --> 24:07.160
What's up?

24:07.160 --> 24:11.400
Oh, yeah, glad the home state is represented here.

24:11.400 --> 24:14.480
Don't hit your grandma.

24:14.480 --> 24:18.680
Hey, your grandma can be as scary as she wants.

24:18.680 --> 24:20.960
That's not a fucking invitation.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.240
It's your grandma.

24:22.240 --> 24:30.440
You can't you can't make her stop sneaking up on you because you can't make anybody older than 70 do anything.

24:30.440 --> 24:32.560
I do. I like that in your mind.

24:32.560 --> 24:37.920
This is just a random happenstance of a conflagration of things that she does.

24:37.920 --> 24:39.480
She's doing it on purpose.

24:39.480 --> 24:41.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, fucking funny.

24:41.360 --> 24:44.560
Yeah. Your grandma's hunting you.

24:44.560 --> 24:45.840
That's obvious. Yeah.

24:45.840 --> 24:51.400
You're not accidentally silent like she's sneaking up on you to scare you.

24:51.400 --> 24:54.320
This is a hot. This is a past time.

24:54.320 --> 24:57.160
She was she was born before the Xbox.

24:57.160 --> 25:01.760
She can't just go play Halo and hang out with Master Chief and all of her friends.

25:01.760 --> 25:03.840
Right. This is the game that she played.

25:03.840 --> 25:05.320
She was born in the dark.

25:05.320 --> 25:14.720
Right. And you want her you want her to go from sneaking behind the Huns enemy lines to collect intel to just like watching Mori Povich.

25:14.720 --> 25:19.240
She was a spy. Your grandma was a super sneaky spy.

25:19.240 --> 25:23.320
Duh. That seemed obvious to me reading the question.

25:23.320 --> 25:25.680
So she was a super sneaky spy.

25:25.680 --> 25:32.360
And how are you guys caught up on the Americans or I don't want to spoil anything.

25:32.360 --> 25:38.080
I haven't watched it. So if you were expecting some sort of joke relevant.

25:38.080 --> 25:40.440
Thank you, Travis. That's the word.

25:40.440 --> 25:45.160
I have a thing I want to suggest, but I also don't want to suggest.

25:45.160 --> 25:46.760
Well, let's take a poll.

25:46.760 --> 25:54.520
If you if you if you spook your grandma just once in a similar fashion.

25:54.520 --> 25:55.480
Fine line.

25:55.480 --> 26:00.360
Immediately retracted, immediately struck from the record, immediately edited.

26:00.360 --> 26:02.840
Also, your grandma will hit you.

26:02.840 --> 26:06.320
You could do that. She will give you one chance at that.

26:06.320 --> 26:09.200
She might be training. Like, why is it?

26:09.200 --> 26:14.320
OK, I don't want to get combative.

26:14.320 --> 26:17.800
But you know, your grandmother lives in the house and she does this.

26:17.800 --> 26:19.520
How is your head not on a swivel at this point?

26:19.520 --> 26:20.640
24-7, 24-7.

26:20.640 --> 26:25.560
How are you not just like, ah, your grandma's like sneaking up behind you.

26:25.560 --> 26:29.240
Ah, she's like, that's what the world is like.

26:29.240 --> 26:32.320
Oh, she's trying to make you hard, strong and hard.

26:32.320 --> 26:38.200
Yeah, you got to be tough because one day it won't be me sneaking up on you.

26:38.200 --> 26:41.680
It'll be the Batman.

26:41.680 --> 26:45.400
One day it'll be Zorro.

26:45.400 --> 26:47.760
What? What are you talking about?

26:47.760 --> 26:48.920
It'll be the Shadow.

26:48.920 --> 26:52.000
Stop it. It's really old stuff.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.760
It'll be Fibber McGee and Molly.

26:53.760 --> 26:55.120
Come on, Grandma.

26:55.120 --> 26:56.960
You're just making stuff.

27:02.440 --> 27:06.360
It was the I had a bug on my iPad.

27:06.360 --> 27:07.520
Let me see.

27:07.520 --> 27:10.440
You're going to. It's that new iOS, man.

27:10.440 --> 27:15.160
Oh, shit. We have a haunted doll wash coming in hot.

27:18.640 --> 27:22.680
This is rough. This is rough.

27:22.680 --> 27:24.160
This is Rose.

27:24.160 --> 27:26.680
Sorry, Mr. Reddit.

27:26.960 --> 27:30.840
It would be weird if their posting started with, this is rough.

27:30.840 --> 27:31.680
This is rough.

27:31.680 --> 27:34.320
It would be weird pretty much anyway it started because

27:34.320 --> 27:36.960
it's eBay listing for a doll that is haunted.

27:36.960 --> 27:38.600
But let's just see what this one says.

27:38.600 --> 27:41.880
Haunted dolls found in the storage after Grandma passed away.

27:41.880 --> 27:43.880
What just happened?

27:43.880 --> 27:49.560
Oh, shit. Are you with us right now?

27:49.720 --> 27:54.040
I am having paranormal activity after bringing these dolls home.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.360
At first, I was very scared,

27:56.360 --> 27:59.240
but now I'm spending more time with each doll in order to get

27:59.240 --> 28:03.160
a sense of their energy and give the buyer as much information as possible.

28:03.160 --> 28:09.240
I love this phrase. I am what they call a sensitive.

28:09.440 --> 28:14.400
Therefore, I'm able to use all my senses and feel spirits.

28:14.400 --> 28:19.240
My grandma was a kind loving spirit and my Aunt Angelica was

28:19.240 --> 28:21.680
a healer and a psychic in her country.

28:21.680 --> 28:23.000
Family business. Love that.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.040
Just like this podcast.

28:24.040 --> 28:25.760
She was fake and not real.

28:25.760 --> 28:28.640
She was a psychic. She was a psychic in her country.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.640
She got over here and was like, I can't see shit.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.000
I don't know. I don't know, man.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.040
I'm not getting the signal. I got direct TV now.

28:34.040 --> 28:35.000
I don't know.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.320
I only do metric.

28:37.320 --> 28:39.320
I was taken care of by my aunt,

28:39.320 --> 28:42.400
so I learned how to perceive and work with energy from an early age.

28:42.400 --> 28:48.080
I'm using different forms of communication as a pendulum and automatic writing

28:48.080 --> 28:51.840
in order to give my buyers as much information as I can about my spirit dolls.

28:52.520 --> 28:55.000
If you decided to buy any of my dolls,

28:55.000 --> 28:58.080
you need to establish your own way of communicating with your spirit.

28:58.080 --> 29:00.560
It's like, listen, it's not that it doesn't work.

29:00.560 --> 29:02.960
You just need to find, like, your thing.

29:02.960 --> 29:04.680
Yeah, go your own way.

29:04.680 --> 29:08.800
My Aunt Angelica, a renowned psychic and healer in Costa Rica.

29:08.800 --> 29:10.920
By the way, in case you're keeping track,

29:10.920 --> 29:14.640
we are not yet to the item description.

29:14.640 --> 29:19.800
These have just been bona fides at this point.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.320
So here's the doll vessel.

29:21.320 --> 29:23.880
It's five inches tall, porcelain brown eyes.

29:23.880 --> 29:26.760
That is quite little. That is quite a tiny doll, actually.

29:26.760 --> 29:27.840
Not so scary.

29:27.840 --> 29:29.320
It's a McDonald's Beanie Baby.

29:29.320 --> 29:33.680
This, this person got pretty buck wild with capital letters.

29:33.680 --> 29:35.480
So I'm going to try to emulate it as best I can.

29:36.160 --> 29:40.280
Rose is the embodiment of pure love.

29:42.680 --> 29:47.360
Her aura is pink and she is able to transmit her loving energy

29:47.360 --> 29:49.560
with beams of light. Sure.

29:49.560 --> 29:53.720
She has come through to help someone find their soulmate

29:53.720 --> 29:56.720
and bring loving people into recipient's life.

29:56.720 --> 30:01.920
She is an angelic spirit that should be given respect

30:01.920 --> 30:06.200
and care. Recipient should place her on a nightstand

30:06.200 --> 30:08.640
with a pink candle where prayers should be made.

30:09.880 --> 30:12.920
A good, good night. Have a good night.

30:12.920 --> 30:15.800
My personal experience with Rose.

30:16.520 --> 30:19.960
She emits a pink warm glow and warm sensations on your body.

30:19.960 --> 30:21.800
When you hold her, you're filled with love.

30:21.800 --> 30:26.400
Angels are the intermediates between God and humans.

30:26.400 --> 30:29.560
They are able to help us send and receive messages from God.

30:30.200 --> 30:34.480
They are pure love and light and always by our side to help us.

30:36.400 --> 30:38.000
Disclaimer.

30:40.920 --> 30:43.920
No returns is the disclaimer on that.

30:43.920 --> 30:49.040
So that's Rose. You can just catch Rose on eBay right now.

30:49.040 --> 30:53.320
You can go get Rose. Why? Why? Why would you need that disclaimer?

30:53.320 --> 30:55.680
You just spent like four paragraphs saying

30:55.680 --> 31:00.440
if you pray to this doll, God will put cool people in your life.

31:00.440 --> 31:03.480
But no returns. If you touch this doll,

31:03.480 --> 31:06.800
you'll feel love for the first time and warm sensations over your body.

31:06.800 --> 31:09.200
And God will talk to you through the doll.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.200
All transactions are final.

31:14.120 --> 31:16.520
Holy shit. Yeah.

31:18.000 --> 31:24.000
I, I will say I like a haunted doll that is actually an angel doll.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.560
Right. I like that. That's nice.

31:26.560 --> 31:28.880
It's not spooky. It's not spooky. It's nice.

31:28.880 --> 31:31.600
Yeah. We like to ignore the fact that angels are just ghosts

31:31.600 --> 31:33.440
that you do want around.

31:33.440 --> 31:36.240
But I'm glad. To help you cheat at baseball.

31:36.240 --> 31:38.680
To help you cheat at baseball. Exactly.

31:43.440 --> 31:45.720
You want to know, I have a regular question.

31:45.720 --> 31:46.920
How about a regular question?

31:46.920 --> 31:50.440
And then maybe depending on how long the regular question goes,

31:50.440 --> 31:54.080
maybe we can kick it to audience questions after that.

31:54.080 --> 31:57.920
Okay. Got it. Perfect.

31:57.920 --> 32:00.960
Here we go. Here it comes.

32:00.960 --> 32:03.000
I need your help. I love my job.

32:03.000 --> 32:08.360
Unlock the iPad and then you want to go to the Google drives.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.840
I love my job, but there's one problem.

32:10.840 --> 32:14.920
My boss is obsessed with Taco Bell.

32:14.920 --> 32:18.120
He forces everyone on my team to eat there every week.

32:18.120 --> 32:20.600
Forces? Forces.

32:20.600 --> 32:21.640
Open your fucking mouth.

32:21.640 --> 32:24.360
It's a kiss. Don't get down.

32:24.360 --> 32:27.480
Any time one of us even suggests the different restaurant,

32:27.480 --> 32:30.720
he threatens to fire us.

32:30.720 --> 32:33.280
I used to actually enjoy the bell,

32:33.280 --> 32:35.560
but after three years of eating under duress,

32:35.560 --> 32:37.920
it's lost its flavor. I have died.

32:37.920 --> 32:40.440
I'm dead. And I'm in a doll.

32:40.440 --> 32:43.160
I'm writing to you from hell.

32:43.160 --> 32:45.440
How do I escape this Taco Friday trap,

32:45.440 --> 32:54.080
but also keep my job that's from Southern Bell and Taco Hell?

32:54.080 --> 32:56.520
Are you present? Are you with us?

32:56.520 --> 32:58.400
Benevolent spirit. Are you with us, spirit?

32:58.400 --> 32:59.640
No. Dead person.

32:59.640 --> 33:04.200
Okay. Now, there are many things that I am not.

33:04.200 --> 33:07.720
And one of them is like a legal expert.

33:07.720 --> 33:13.320
Sure. But I'm pretty sure he can't fire you for that.

33:13.320 --> 33:17.440
Yeah. Do you have an HR- Is the HR person just a mop

33:17.440 --> 33:20.440
with glasses on it that this boss created?

33:20.440 --> 33:24.360
Just wearing a sign that says Taco Bell Yum Yum?

33:24.360 --> 33:27.920
Let me get a number nine with three softies.

33:27.920 --> 33:29.760
That's what we call soft tacos in Austin, Texas.

33:29.760 --> 33:33.320
It's not catching on.

33:33.320 --> 33:36.560
I would love this.

33:36.560 --> 33:38.760
No. Because basically,

33:38.760 --> 33:41.040
whenever somebody asks me, I want to eat,

33:41.040 --> 33:44.480
the answer in my heart is Taco Bell.

33:44.480 --> 33:47.920
And then there are other things in my body,

33:47.920 --> 33:52.960
social, mental, economic, physical, sort of existential,

33:52.960 --> 33:55.640
things like that, snares that I put in place

33:55.640 --> 33:58.400
to keep myself from eating Taco Bell at every meal.

33:58.400 --> 34:01.880
Is it beans is the first step in the flow chart?

34:01.880 --> 34:03.120
Beans are a good stopgap

34:03.120 --> 34:05.880
because there's no room in the tummy for nothing else.

34:05.880 --> 34:08.840
But if I had a boss that forced me to eat Taco Bell,

34:08.840 --> 34:10.440
I think that would give me permission to sort of be like,

34:10.440 --> 34:12.720
well, I need this job.

34:12.720 --> 34:17.600
Wait, question asked was looking at this, all wrong.

34:17.600 --> 34:21.880
What you have is the shortest path to promotion ever.

34:21.880 --> 34:22.720
Why?

34:22.720 --> 34:24.360
Because like on Thursday, you look at the boss like,

34:24.360 --> 34:25.840
you know what I'm craving?

34:25.840 --> 34:27.080
Hey.

34:27.080 --> 34:28.600
Little Taco Bell.

34:28.600 --> 34:29.440
Little T-Bell.

34:29.440 --> 34:31.720
Hey man, brought in, I went to Taco Bell.

34:31.720 --> 34:33.960
I know, again, love it.

34:33.960 --> 34:35.800
Had some extra, do you want some?

34:35.800 --> 34:38.160
I know you were considering Marsha for the big promotion,

34:38.160 --> 34:40.280
but you know what I heard?

34:40.280 --> 34:43.400
She is thinking inside the bun.

34:43.400 --> 34:46.780
So one thing about her is that,

34:46.780 --> 34:51.300
could you start taking your boss out to lunch more?

34:51.300 --> 34:53.120
And it's always Taco Bell.

34:53.120 --> 34:54.800
See if you could burn him out.

34:56.160 --> 34:57.360
Oh, what are you in the mood for?

34:57.360 --> 35:00.880
Just kidding, I know what you want, Taco Bell.

35:00.880 --> 35:03.040
We just left the Taco Bell.

35:03.040 --> 35:04.160
I know.

35:04.160 --> 35:05.000
I know.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.480
Oh my, I thought you liked Taco Bell.

35:06.480 --> 35:08.960
Weird, I guess I like it way more than you, huh?

35:08.960 --> 35:10.080
Weird.

35:10.080 --> 35:10.920
I thought you were the number one T-Bell fan.

35:10.920 --> 35:14.600
How is the, by the way, smoking crater of a bathroom

35:14.600 --> 35:16.840
at this fucking office building?

35:19.600 --> 35:20.440
Hey.

35:20.440 --> 35:24.000
Not to get blue, but you are in a science experiment

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
and you don't know it.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.640
I'm gonna be working from home every Friday afternoon

35:28.640 --> 35:30.400
for the rest of my life.

35:30.400 --> 35:35.000
So I'm never coming to this building on Friday afternoons.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.160
I wonder if it's reached the point

35:36.160 --> 35:38.040
where the boss walks into Taco Bell

35:38.040 --> 35:40.440
and the employees are like, no.

35:40.440 --> 35:42.200
No, dog.

35:42.200 --> 35:43.760
Please, we care about you.

35:43.760 --> 35:46.880
Taco Bell doesn't make its employees eat Taco Bell

35:46.880 --> 35:47.840
once a week.

35:47.840 --> 35:49.160
Like, seriously.

35:51.080 --> 35:52.480
Yeah, we've had a lot of turnover.

35:52.480 --> 35:55.360
We've had to outlaw the eating of the food.

35:57.400 --> 35:58.360
How about one more Yahoo?

35:58.360 --> 35:59.920
This one was sent in by Level 9000.

35:59.920 --> 36:02.680
Yahdrew, Druid, Drew Davenport, thank you, Drew.

36:02.680 --> 36:09.360
It's from Yahdrew Answers user, Alex, who asks,

36:09.360 --> 36:15.320
what would happen if you put pets in virtual reality?

36:15.320 --> 36:17.440
Like a cat or a dog?

36:17.440 --> 36:19.200
Yeah, thank you, thank you.

36:19.200 --> 36:21.000
Those are common pets.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.520
If they somehow figured out a way

36:22.520 --> 36:26.120
to transfer your nervous system and apply animals translate,

36:26.120 --> 36:28.360
would that mean people could talk to their pets

36:28.360 --> 36:30.840
and would they be able to act like humans?

36:30.840 --> 36:33.760
Okay, like, stop.

36:33.760 --> 36:35.800
Did you see the new season of Catfish?

36:35.800 --> 36:37.000
It was wild.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.040
A catfish got in the virtual world

36:39.040 --> 36:43.280
and pretended to be a human using the mind link.

36:43.280 --> 36:48.200
We are talking, these are two wildly different questions.

36:48.200 --> 36:50.440
Could my dog play super hot?

36:50.440 --> 36:54.560
And also, can I talk to my dog with my mind?

36:54.560 --> 36:56.040
Are you fucking with me?

36:56.040 --> 36:58.960
One question is about putting a helmet on a dog

36:58.960 --> 37:02.840
and the other one's about fucking creating dog language

37:02.840 --> 37:04.800
and community, like, we are probably gonna need

37:04.800 --> 37:07.840
to pioneer that before we get into VR

37:07.840 --> 37:10.840
rather than trying to back into dog communication.

37:10.840 --> 37:14.040
Yeah, that would be a weird, like, thing to fall into.

37:14.040 --> 37:15.800
Like, yeah, we were all thinking,

37:15.800 --> 37:18.000
what the fuck, you want what?

37:18.000 --> 37:20.920
He just said he wanted a bone, this is great.

37:20.920 --> 37:23.000
I think this is a dog.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.800
He looks like a virtual dude, but I have my suspicions.

37:26.800 --> 37:29.160
Could I put my pet in VR?

37:29.160 --> 37:30.960
And also, could I talk to my pet?

37:30.960 --> 37:33.560
And also, if I ate Fritos, would it make me fly?

37:33.560 --> 37:36.080
And this is in a world where Fritos make you fly.

37:36.080 --> 37:39.560
So those are the other questions that are corollary on it.

37:39.560 --> 37:42.280
Though we do need to work that technology out first.

37:42.280 --> 37:44.560
Dog would bite it.

37:44.560 --> 37:48.600
Not enjoy the helmet experience for a bit.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.040
You would need to do the helmet and the cone.

37:52.600 --> 37:56.160
I have actually found that if I do FaceTime with my wife

37:56.160 --> 37:57.000
and the dog is around,

37:57.000 --> 37:59.440
the dog does not respond to me whatsoever.

37:59.440 --> 38:02.240
So my thought process is,

38:02.240 --> 38:03.960
if you put the helmet on the dog,

38:03.960 --> 38:05.160
the dog would just sit there like,

38:05.160 --> 38:07.000
I don't know what to do with this.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.920
This smells like nothing to me.

38:08.920 --> 38:12.200
Until a million balls come flying at them,

38:12.200 --> 38:14.640
holy shit, I just turned the corner

38:14.640 --> 38:16.880
and I'm very into dog VR.

38:18.160 --> 38:21.200
I think dogs should be able to use virtual reality.

38:21.200 --> 38:23.520
There, I think we should set it.

38:23.520 --> 38:26.640
Because imagine you're a sweet pup

38:26.640 --> 38:31.640
and just a billion bones fall down from the sky.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.520
I can't make that happen for a dog,

38:35.520 --> 38:40.000
but like dog's second life could ostensibly make that happen.

38:40.000 --> 38:44.440
Dogs, you've been keeping your dog prisoner for years.

38:44.440 --> 38:46.160
This is the least you could do,

38:46.160 --> 38:48.200
is to let them have a peek at the outside world.

38:48.200 --> 38:50.680
My dog would not do well in the outside world.

38:50.680 --> 38:53.320
She is institutionalized, she is happy where she is.

38:53.320 --> 38:57.000
Your dog would look at you with some amount of betrayal,

38:57.000 --> 38:59.320
like, this is what you've been doing the whole time?

38:59.320 --> 39:00.920
And you kept this from me?

39:00.920 --> 39:03.240
Like, of course, why wouldn't you share this with me?

39:03.240 --> 39:04.080
This is fantastic.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.560
This is incredible, there's a water slide, this is great.

39:06.560 --> 39:08.040
This is fantastic.

39:08.040 --> 39:09.560
And I can't die here?

39:09.560 --> 39:10.720
Whoa, hold on.

39:13.600 --> 39:16.520
Okay, wait, stop, no, stop.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.840
Your dog does not know they're going to die.

39:18.840 --> 39:21.360
That's why they're so jized all the time.

39:21.360 --> 39:22.840
Jized.

39:22.840 --> 39:25.680
Don't, okay, you get VR.

39:25.680 --> 39:29.920
The first thing you do in VR is just you learn dog language

39:29.920 --> 39:31.720
and then you use that to communicate

39:31.720 --> 39:33.960
the idea of mortality.

39:33.960 --> 39:35.680
And then your dog's gonna be like,

39:35.680 --> 39:37.840
and I can shoot a bow and arrow in here too?

39:37.840 --> 39:41.480
Amazing, thank you for the goggles, I love it.

39:41.480 --> 39:45.400
And again, what about seven, one seventh as long as,

39:45.400 --> 39:48.000
okay, dog ears, I finally understand.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.640
I've been wondering what you guys meant by that,

39:49.640 --> 39:51.720
but thank you so much for clarifying.

39:51.720 --> 39:53.280
This is fantastic.

39:53.280 --> 39:56.280
Hey everybody, this is Griffin McElroy.

40:05.280 --> 40:07.680
Thank you so much for listening to our live show

40:07.680 --> 40:11.040
from Nashville, from our tour that we did this past weekend.

40:11.040 --> 40:12.720
We had a lot of fun down in the southeast

40:12.720 --> 40:13.680
in Nashville and Atlanta.

40:13.680 --> 40:17.280
Thank you to everybody who came out to those live shows.

40:17.280 --> 40:19.800
We were hoping to be able to record another episode

40:19.800 --> 40:21.640
while we were there so we wouldn't have two live shows

40:21.640 --> 40:22.720
go up back to back again,

40:22.720 --> 40:24.920
but unfortunately we did not have time.

40:24.920 --> 40:27.360
The next episode that goes up will be a regular episode.

40:27.360 --> 40:29.320
We'll probably sit on the Atlanta live show

40:29.320 --> 40:31.600
for a little while, but yeah,

40:31.600 --> 40:33.680
that's just kind of the way that it shook out.

40:33.680 --> 40:35.320
But thank you all so much for listening.

40:35.320 --> 40:38.200
Real quick, if you live in Chicago or around Chicago

40:38.200 --> 40:39.400
and you wanna come see us,

40:39.400 --> 40:42.000
we added another date in Chicago.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.960
That is Thursday, November the 16th,

40:45.960 --> 40:48.200
and we still have a bunch of tickets available for that.

40:48.200 --> 40:51.120
If you wanna come see us, please do.

40:51.120 --> 40:53.320

40:53.320 --> 40:55.840

40:55.840 --> 40:57.560
I think we still have some tickets available

40:57.560 --> 41:00.200
for the Milwaukee show on that tour as well.

41:00.200 --> 41:02.940
All those are at mcroyshows.com slash tours.

41:02.940 --> 41:04.360
I wanna tell you about our sponsors this week.

41:04.360 --> 41:06.920

41:16.720 --> 41:17.840
They'll send you a digital scale

41:17.840 --> 41:20.620
which automatically calculates exact postage,

41:20.620 --> 41:23.480

Also wanna tell you about Squarespace.

41:45.640 --> 41:48.520
Squarespace allows you to create a beautiful website

41:48.520 --> 41:51.960
that you can use to turn your cool idea into a website

41:51.960 --> 41:55.460
or sell your products and services of any kind.

41:55.460 --> 41:57.040
We have a Squarespace website.

41:57.040 --> 41:59.040
It is the aforementioned mcroyshows.com.

41:59.040 --> 42:02.800
Travis whipped it up and links out to all of our stuff

42:02.800 --> 42:05.000
and it looks really, really good.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.440
Squarespace allows you the ability to customize your site

42:18.420 --> 42:19.260

42:19.260 --> 42:20.720
I don't know, but make it fuckin' stand out.

42:20.720 --> 42:22.960
If you're gonna make it, make people see it.

42:51.040 --> 42:53.040
First message is for Ray and Kristen,

42:53.040 --> 42:54.720
and it's from Rob, who says,

42:54.720 --> 42:57.940
"'Happy first anniversary, Bear and Mrs. Bear.

42:57.940 --> 43:00.520
"'May you have many happy hibernations to come.'"

43:00.520 --> 43:01.960
And that's from Brother Bear.

43:01.960 --> 43:04.600
I don't know how these bears got a laptop in the forest,

43:04.600 --> 43:06.680
unless, of course, it is those wonderful bears

43:06.680 --> 43:09.600
from Wee Bear Bears who do have a laptop in the forest

43:09.600 --> 43:13.060
and, oh my god, cartoons are real.

43:13.060 --> 43:14.460
All cartoons are real.

43:14.460 --> 43:17.600
Congratulations on your anniversary, Bear and Mrs. Bear.

43:17.600 --> 43:19.180
Or Ray and Kristen.

43:19.180 --> 43:20.820
I don't know if this is for humans or bears,

43:20.820 --> 43:22.860
but it warms my heart either way.

43:22.860 --> 43:24.800
This next message is for Scott,

43:24.800 --> 43:26.320
and that's Scott with one t,

43:26.320 --> 43:29.180
and it's from Ty, who says,

43:29.180 --> 43:31.020
"'Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott,

43:31.020 --> 43:33.160
"'Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott,

43:33.160 --> 43:36.120
"'Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott,"

43:36.120 --> 43:36.960
like 40 times.

43:36.960 --> 43:39.800
"'Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott."

43:39.800 --> 43:40.940
And that's the end of the message.

43:40.940 --> 43:42.640
I don't know if I said enough Scots.

43:42.640 --> 43:43.520
I hope I did,

43:43.520 --> 43:45.320
because I don't wanna get in illegal hot water.

43:45.320 --> 43:49.800
Scott, Ty is just really enthusiastic about your name, and we're really enthusiastic about

43:49.800 --> 43:53.120
just sort of your whole life.

43:53.120 --> 43:57.000
Thank you again to the Tennessee Performing Arts Center for having us.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.400
Here in the next chunk of the show is the audience questions, and I wanted to preface

44:00.400 --> 44:03.280
that by saying we tried something new.

44:03.280 --> 44:07.520
We are sort of looking for a way to make the audience questions segment be a little bit

44:07.520 --> 44:13.400
more based around the audience actually asking questions instead of sort of saying like a

44:13.400 --> 44:19.600
funny thing or anecdote, which is very enjoyable, but it's not maybe the best launchpad for

44:19.600 --> 44:22.280
what we do in a live environment.

44:22.280 --> 44:25.960
So we try something new in this next segment where we have two people ask questions and

44:25.960 --> 44:29.840
then we pick the one that we think we can help the most while still trying to help out

44:29.840 --> 44:34.080
the other person just in a much more brisk manner.

44:34.080 --> 44:39.200
I think that it might come off as like mean or overly competitive at first, but I promise

44:39.200 --> 44:41.240
you that is never going to be the intention of it.

44:41.240 --> 44:46.640
It's just like a way for us to really hone in on the questions that are sort of best

44:46.640 --> 44:53.160
suited for this to make sure that we can answer the stuff that I think we can do the most

44:53.160 --> 44:56.000
good for or have the most fun with.

44:56.000 --> 44:59.400
I think it went really, really well, and I think we're probably going to do this moving

44:59.400 --> 45:02.640
forward because I think the audience had a lot of fun with it too.

45:02.640 --> 45:04.940
So I just wanted to preface that because I didn't want you to hear what we were doing

45:04.940 --> 45:10.080
and think like we had turned super shitty and wanted our live shows to turn into some

45:10.080 --> 45:12.900
sort of blood sport or anything.

45:12.900 --> 45:15.200
So yeah, I think that's probably it.

45:15.200 --> 45:18.480
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters for theme songs that depart you off the album

45:18.480 --> 45:19.520
Putting the Days to Bed.

45:19.520 --> 45:20.720
Thank you to Max Fun for having us.

45:20.720 --> 45:24.600
Go to maximumfun.org, check out all the great podcasts there, and yeah, I'm going to let

45:24.600 --> 45:29.680
you get back to the rest of the episode, and the next one will be just a regular episode

45:29.680 --> 45:32.360
that is going to go up October 30th.

45:32.360 --> 45:35.240
All Hallows Eve Eve!

45:35.240 --> 45:37.240
I'm a ghoul.

45:37.240 --> 45:38.240
Bye.

45:38.240 --> 45:40.040
Hello, I'm Kerry Poppy.

45:40.040 --> 45:44.240
And I'm Ross Blatcher, host of maximumfun.org's Ono, Ross, and Kerry.

45:44.240 --> 45:47.600
We wanted to tell you the good news that our podcast is now weekly.

45:47.600 --> 45:48.600
Yeah, weekly!

45:48.600 --> 45:51.400
On Ono, Ross, and Kerry, we don't make extraordinary claims.

45:51.400 --> 45:52.400
We investigate them.

45:52.400 --> 45:56.600
We go undercover with fringe religious groups, investigate paranormal claims, and participate

45:56.600 --> 46:00.240
in pseudoscientific medical treatments and report our findings to you.

46:00.240 --> 46:04.560
In a time where alternative facts reign supreme, we cut through the murky spin to give you

46:04.560 --> 46:11.240
the real deal on topics like UFOs, the anti-vaccination movement, Scientology, and even apocalyptic

46:11.240 --> 46:12.240
churches.

46:12.240 --> 46:16.080
We're even undercover for some very exciting investigations right now.

46:16.080 --> 46:18.400
Well, not right now, right now.

46:18.400 --> 46:20.400
Yeah, that would be unwise.

46:20.400 --> 46:23.320
That's Ono, Ross, and Kerry at maximumfun.org.

46:23.320 --> 46:25.280
We show up so you don't have to.

46:25.280 --> 46:26.280
Fantastic.

46:26.280 --> 46:30.240
On that uplifting note, should we turn it over to the audience?

46:30.240 --> 46:31.240
We should.

46:31.240 --> 46:32.400
All right, some ground rules.

46:32.400 --> 46:34.360
Please don't get up and line up in front of the mics.

46:34.360 --> 46:36.280
We're going to try some different stuff out.

46:36.280 --> 46:38.320
Who was at our Atlanta show last night?

46:38.320 --> 46:40.680
It was a lot of fun.

46:40.680 --> 46:44.720
Got a little out of hand on the audience questions part.

46:44.720 --> 46:46.440
We have some new stuff we want to try out.

46:46.440 --> 46:47.980
Justin came up with the idea.

46:47.980 --> 46:53.080
It might be a little mean, so I want to let Justin explain what the rules of it are.

46:53.080 --> 46:54.080
It's not mean.

46:54.080 --> 46:55.080
It's not mean.

46:55.080 --> 46:56.080
It's fun.

46:56.080 --> 46:57.080
First, let me check on something.

46:57.080 --> 46:59.080
Do we have two microphones for audience usage?

46:59.080 --> 47:00.080
Yes, we do.

47:00.080 --> 47:01.080
Stage left, stage right.

47:01.080 --> 47:02.080
Stage left, stage right.

47:02.080 --> 47:03.080
Fantastic.

47:03.080 --> 47:04.080
Here's what we're going to do.

47:04.080 --> 47:08.080
We're going to have two people come simultaneously.

47:08.080 --> 47:09.560
Amp versus amp.

47:09.560 --> 47:10.560
No.

47:10.560 --> 47:13.960
In the program I've devised, they'll both tell us-

47:13.960 --> 47:16.280
Do you want to play a game?

47:16.280 --> 47:19.480
They'll both tell us their questions.

47:19.480 --> 47:21.200
Then I will choose- No.

47:21.200 --> 47:27.720
We will hear your questions, and again, questions, not anecdotes, if you don't mind.

47:27.720 --> 47:30.680
I saw a cool kite at the park yesterday.

47:30.680 --> 47:31.680
Am I good?

47:31.680 --> 47:33.800
No, you're not actually, because I asked for a question.

47:33.800 --> 47:39.000
So questions, and then we will choose who we can help the most.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
The other person we will appreciate, but their life is-

47:41.000 --> 47:43.480
A trap door will open immediately below you.

47:43.480 --> 47:44.480
They will be killed.

47:44.480 --> 47:47.400
They will be prestiged.

47:47.400 --> 47:50.600
We're going to choose the person we can help most, and the other person will kindly take

47:50.600 --> 47:54.480
a seat, but we will very much appreciate them sharing their life with us for that brief

47:54.480 --> 47:55.480
moment.

47:55.480 --> 47:59.120
But that is how we are going to try to- We only have a limited amount of time to do audience

47:59.120 --> 48:03.440
questions, so we want to make sure we help people who need it the most, or we can do

48:03.440 --> 48:04.440
the most good.

48:04.440 --> 48:05.440
And you know the other main role?

48:05.440 --> 48:06.440
No bummer.

48:06.440 --> 48:07.440
Cool.

48:07.440 --> 48:09.240
Can we get even more house lights?

48:09.240 --> 48:10.240
It's kind of scary.

48:10.240 --> 48:11.240
Yeah, it's a little hard to say.

48:11.240 --> 48:12.240
Maybe a little less us-like.

48:12.240 --> 48:13.240
It kind of looks like a million ghosts.

48:13.240 --> 48:18.540
And I'll let them pick while I go pick- Oh my God.

48:18.540 --> 48:19.540
That is fantastic.

48:19.540 --> 48:20.540
Thank you.

48:20.540 --> 48:21.540
All right.

48:21.540 --> 48:23.080
I see a guy in a hat, and somebody else is pointing to somebody.

48:23.080 --> 48:25.680
I see a shadow with a hat on, and somebody's pointing.

48:25.680 --> 48:26.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:26.680 --> 48:27.680
You're waving your hat in the air.

48:27.680 --> 48:28.680
You're good.

48:28.680 --> 48:29.680
Travis, somebody on the left.

48:29.680 --> 48:30.680
I'm looking.

48:30.680 --> 48:31.680
Hmm.

48:31.680 --> 48:32.680
Okay.

48:32.680 --> 48:33.680
I see a guy in a long sleeve shirt.

48:33.680 --> 48:34.680
Yep.

48:34.680 --> 48:35.680
Yep.

48:35.680 --> 48:36.680
That person.

48:36.680 --> 48:37.680
We're good.

48:37.680 --> 48:38.680
All right.

48:38.680 --> 48:39.680
Way to go.

48:39.680 --> 48:40.680
Here we go.

48:40.680 --> 48:41.680
Left and right.

48:41.680 --> 48:42.680
Let's start with you.

48:42.680 --> 48:43.680
What's your name?

48:43.680 --> 48:44.680
Zach.

48:44.680 --> 48:45.680
What's up, Zach?

48:45.680 --> 48:46.680
What's up?

48:46.680 --> 48:50.400
And what's your name?

48:50.400 --> 48:51.400
My name is Allen.

48:51.400 --> 48:52.400
Sorry?

48:52.400 --> 48:53.400
Allen.

48:53.400 --> 48:54.400
Allen.

48:54.400 --> 48:55.400
Allen.

48:55.400 --> 48:56.400
Allen with an E.

48:56.400 --> 48:57.400
Allen.

48:57.400 --> 48:58.400
Thank you.

48:58.400 --> 48:59.400
Degenerate.

48:59.400 --> 49:00.400
All right.

49:00.400 --> 49:01.400
Zach, here's Justin.

49:01.400 --> 49:02.400
All right.

49:02.400 --> 49:03.400
So we had wireless mics.

49:03.400 --> 49:05.520
We could do the whole show from the can.

49:05.520 --> 49:07.600
And that is the ideal.

49:07.600 --> 49:09.840
Zach, what is your question?

49:09.840 --> 49:12.160
We'll start with you, because you were at the mic first.

49:12.160 --> 49:13.160
Okay.

49:13.160 --> 49:15.160
First thing, Justin, thanks for coming back.

49:15.160 --> 49:16.160
Appreciate it.

49:16.160 --> 49:17.160
No problem.

49:17.160 --> 49:20.000
So pretty soon going to become an uncle.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
Nice.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.960
My brother and his wife are going to have a baby.

49:22.960 --> 49:24.960
That's typically how it works.

49:24.960 --> 49:25.960
Yes, yes.

49:25.960 --> 49:26.960
Yeah.

49:26.960 --> 49:27.960
Ran the numbers.

49:27.960 --> 49:28.960
That's how it works.

49:28.960 --> 49:34.280
My parents have started to do the whole, like, we're coming up with, like, what our grandparent

49:34.280 --> 49:35.280
names are going to be.

49:35.280 --> 49:36.280
Sure.

49:36.280 --> 49:48.680
And so for whatever reason, my dad thinks it's a good idea for his name to be Tarzan.

49:48.680 --> 49:49.680
Extremely good.

49:49.680 --> 49:56.760
So please, for the love of God, how do I tell my dad that that's an awful idea, and I do

49:56.760 --> 49:57.760
not want that.

49:57.760 --> 49:58.760
That's a pretty good one.

49:58.760 --> 49:59.760
Okay.

49:59.760 --> 50:00.760
Exactly.

50:00.760 --> 50:01.760
Ellen.

50:01.760 --> 50:02.760
Bring the heat.

50:02.760 --> 50:03.760
Okay.

50:03.760 --> 50:09.880
So I literally work at my dream job, and it's wonderful, except I have a co-worker who

50:09.880 --> 50:15.880
has worked with this company for 17 years, I believe, and he doesn't understand things

50:15.880 --> 50:19.800
like how to load the printer.

50:19.800 --> 50:24.840
How do I deal with that?

50:24.840 --> 50:28.000
I'm tempted to go with Tarzan on this one.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
All right.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.720
Because the answer to that one is just to talk to HR.

50:31.720 --> 50:36.680
I feel like I've run out of good office etiquette once, because there's, like, a person who's

50:36.680 --> 50:42.160
like a my brother, my brother and me person personified, except they can actually do shit

50:42.160 --> 50:44.360
who works at the company.

50:44.360 --> 50:45.360
So we can help you both.

50:45.360 --> 50:48.800
Ellen, just talk to that person and try to get them either fired or helped.

50:48.800 --> 50:49.800
Either one is fine.

50:49.800 --> 50:50.800
It's fine.

50:50.800 --> 50:51.800
It solves your problem.

50:51.800 --> 50:52.800
So thank you, Ellen.

50:52.800 --> 50:53.800
Thank you, Ellen.

50:53.800 --> 50:56.800
And we're going to kick it over to you, Zach.

50:56.800 --> 50:57.800
Tarzan.

50:57.800 --> 50:59.960
Tarzan's very good is the only thing.

50:59.960 --> 51:04.400
The thing is, you need to get really comfortable with Tarzan very quickly.

51:04.400 --> 51:10.680
How about instead, how about instead you convince your dad to just go with Lord Greystoke?

51:10.680 --> 51:13.000
Because that is Tarzan's actual name and title.

51:13.000 --> 51:17.600
Convince your dad to go with Christopher Plummer, who, of course, played Tarzan.

51:17.600 --> 51:25.000
It's just buck wild what your dad has done in that you can't, a good grandpa or grandma

51:25.000 --> 51:32.800
name is GG, or PP, or poop, poop, booboo, booboo, if only we had made this joke before

51:32.800 --> 51:33.800
at some point.

51:33.800 --> 51:34.800
No, no.

51:34.800 --> 51:35.800
But it can't.

51:35.800 --> 51:36.800
Oh, yeah, that's right.

51:36.800 --> 51:37.800
We'd fuck.

51:37.800 --> 51:38.800
But it wouldn't.

51:38.800 --> 51:42.320
What it can't be is like Darth Vader.

51:42.320 --> 51:46.200
Okay, so I'm Pac Man.

51:46.200 --> 51:50.600
So even worse is my mom wants to be Lulu.

51:50.600 --> 51:51.600
That's good.

51:51.600 --> 51:52.600
That's good.

51:52.600 --> 51:53.600
Yes, that's cool.

51:53.600 --> 51:54.600
But like, what the fuck is Tarzan?

51:54.600 --> 51:55.920
Yeah, it is.

51:55.920 --> 51:57.240
That is an excellent point.

51:57.240 --> 51:58.240
Yeah.

51:58.240 --> 52:01.680
Because if this kid, okay, here's what you do.

52:01.680 --> 52:05.840
In public, start loudly calling your dad Tarzan.

52:05.840 --> 52:08.100
Yeah.

52:08.100 --> 52:10.120
Make him introduce himself to people.

52:10.120 --> 52:11.120
Oh, me?

52:11.120 --> 52:12.120
I'm Tarzan.

52:12.120 --> 52:13.120
Rub his nose in it.

52:13.120 --> 52:14.120
You know what I mean?

52:14.120 --> 52:16.440
Yeah, shake the old no-no can of life at him.

52:16.440 --> 52:18.320
Just make him introduce himself as Tarzan.

52:18.320 --> 52:19.560
Because that's the thing.

52:19.560 --> 52:24.320
What he's not picturing is a four-year-old in Walmart like yelling two aisles over, Tarzan!

52:24.320 --> 52:25.320
Tarzan!

52:25.320 --> 52:31.840
And him having to look at someone and go, that's me.

52:31.840 --> 52:32.840
That's me.

52:32.840 --> 52:34.200
That's mine.

52:34.200 --> 52:37.240
I came up with that one.

52:37.240 --> 52:40.040
So does that help?

52:40.040 --> 52:41.040
It doesn't help you.

52:41.040 --> 52:42.040
No.

52:42.040 --> 52:43.040
It doesn't help you.

52:43.040 --> 52:44.040
No.

52:44.040 --> 52:46.480
It helps me knowing that this situation is going to be out in the world somewhere.

52:46.480 --> 52:47.480
Yeah.

52:47.480 --> 52:50.880
Makes you feel a little bit better about the state of things.

52:50.880 --> 52:51.880
Thank you, Zach.

52:51.880 --> 52:52.880
Thank you, Zach.

52:52.880 --> 52:53.880
Thank you, Zach.

52:53.880 --> 52:54.880
You've helped, Zach.

52:54.880 --> 52:59.880
All right, Justin, you get to pick this time.

52:59.880 --> 53:00.880
Okay.

53:00.880 --> 53:05.480
I'm going to say this person who's being pointed at would be excellent.

53:05.480 --> 53:06.480
Yes, it's you.

53:06.480 --> 53:07.480
In second row?

53:07.480 --> 53:08.480
Both of you.

53:08.480 --> 53:09.480
Yeah.

53:09.480 --> 53:10.480
Both of you.

53:10.480 --> 53:11.480
You go right.

53:11.480 --> 53:12.480
You go left.

53:12.480 --> 53:13.480
That's it.

53:13.480 --> 53:14.480
Yes.

53:14.480 --> 53:15.480
Oh, this is great.

53:15.480 --> 53:16.480
Yes.

53:16.480 --> 53:17.480
No longer do we have to make the choice.

53:17.480 --> 53:18.480
Frank will choose.

53:18.480 --> 53:19.480
Oh, my God.

53:19.480 --> 53:20.480
Your shirts say...

53:20.480 --> 53:24.560
Okay, real quick, stand up, reverse.

53:24.560 --> 53:26.560
You got to reverse so they won't get it.

53:26.560 --> 53:30.680
Fucking throw five stooges, so you can figure it out.

53:30.680 --> 53:31.680
Come on.

53:31.680 --> 53:32.680
We, we, move to the other side.

53:32.680 --> 53:33.680
We, we, you're on the other side.

53:33.680 --> 53:34.680
Are you kidding me with this?

53:34.680 --> 53:35.680
This is so good.

53:35.680 --> 53:36.680
Yeah.

53:36.680 --> 53:45.920
There are five people in the front row wearing custom shirts that say, we horny for this

53:45.920 --> 53:46.920
one.

53:46.920 --> 53:47.920
Thank you.

53:47.920 --> 53:48.920
Now, also, that is unlicensed.

53:48.920 --> 53:51.920
My brother and I are going to need you to burn it.

53:51.920 --> 53:52.920
Perfect.

53:52.920 --> 53:54.160
Thank you.

53:54.160 --> 53:55.160
It's very good.

53:55.160 --> 53:56.160
It's a very good shirt.

53:56.160 --> 53:57.160
Perfect.

53:57.160 --> 53:58.160
Thank you.

53:58.160 --> 53:59.160
Thank you.

53:59.160 --> 54:00.160
Thank you.

54:00.160 --> 54:01.160
We'll start on this side this time.

54:01.160 --> 54:02.160
What's your name?

54:02.160 --> 54:03.160
My name is Amanda.

54:03.160 --> 54:04.160
Hi, Amanda.

54:04.160 --> 54:05.160
What's your name?

54:05.160 --> 54:06.160
I'm Sandy.

54:06.160 --> 54:07.160
Hi, Sandy.

54:07.160 --> 54:08.160
Hi, Sandy.

54:08.160 --> 54:09.160
Amanda, we'll start with you.

54:09.160 --> 54:10.160
What's your question?

54:10.160 --> 54:11.160
Yeah.

54:11.160 --> 54:13.720
So, I'm going to be ending my graduate school experience and I'm...

54:13.720 --> 54:15.680
Just quit and just fuck this place.

54:15.680 --> 54:16.680
Bye.

54:16.680 --> 54:17.680
Yeah.

54:17.680 --> 54:18.680
Fuck graduate school.

54:18.680 --> 54:24.920
I'm starting a real person job and it's Monday through Thursday and so that's four days,

54:24.920 --> 54:30.400
but I only have four dress shirts and one pair of pants.

54:30.400 --> 54:35.800
Is that okay if I wear the same kind of outfits throughout the week?

54:35.800 --> 54:38.640
Just sort of, just sort of dug it right there.

54:38.640 --> 54:39.640
Yeah.

54:39.640 --> 54:40.640
Is that okay?

54:40.640 --> 54:42.680
Like, how many clothes should I have?

54:42.680 --> 54:43.680
I really don't know.

54:43.680 --> 54:44.680
Okay.

54:44.680 --> 54:45.680
Thank you.

54:45.680 --> 54:47.880
I do see a lot of room for us to help here.

54:47.880 --> 54:48.880
Yeah.

54:48.880 --> 54:49.880
Sure.

54:49.880 --> 54:50.880
What's...

54:50.880 --> 54:51.880
And what is your question?

54:51.880 --> 54:53.880
So, I have a lovely two-year-old daughter named Sonia.

54:53.880 --> 54:58.600
At least I thought she was lovely until I went to the Y to pick her up from childcare

54:58.600 --> 55:04.880
last week and got a full-page report of how she has been stealing toys, pulling chairs

55:04.880 --> 55:15.200
out from underneath other kids and I'm wondering, is my daughter destined for prison or is there

55:15.200 --> 55:18.080
something I can do to help her?

55:18.080 --> 55:19.080
Okay.

55:19.080 --> 55:25.400
I'm gonna, okay, I'm gonna rule here and we're gonna go this way and I'm gonna tell you why.

55:25.400 --> 55:31.360
There's a very slim, slim sliver of daylight with child-rearing questions and it's just

55:31.360 --> 55:34.760
where it's like the could go just off the road.

55:34.760 --> 55:35.760
It's the Kobayashi Maru.

55:35.760 --> 55:36.760
The Kobayashi Maru.

55:36.760 --> 55:37.760
Thank you.

55:37.760 --> 55:43.840
Or the Star Wars whole bomb in there, explode the big, the big one?

55:43.840 --> 55:44.840
The round ship?

55:44.840 --> 55:47.800
The one with the ship and it's got the big moon, but it's not a moon.

55:47.800 --> 55:48.800
Yeah.

55:48.800 --> 55:51.160
I'm about three horses next in and I'm not gonna find this sliver.

55:51.160 --> 55:57.320
I'm not gonna be able to find it, so my prayers are with you and your family and I super do

55:57.320 --> 56:02.920
hope that works out for you, but I'm gonna take the grounder over here if you don't mind.

56:02.920 --> 56:03.920
I hope you understand.

56:03.920 --> 56:08.120
If yours could be answered with buy one more shirt, we would go with it.

56:08.120 --> 56:09.120
No spoilers.

56:09.120 --> 56:10.120
Don't listen.

56:10.120 --> 56:13.120
If we could tell you, oh, just buy one more shirt and then your daughter will do better

56:13.120 --> 56:15.280
in daycare, we would do yours.

56:15.280 --> 56:16.280
Yeah, but seriously.

56:16.280 --> 56:17.280
Thank you.

56:17.280 --> 56:18.280
Thank you.

56:18.280 --> 56:19.280
Yeah.

56:19.280 --> 56:20.280
Thank you.

56:20.280 --> 56:21.280
Hey, what's up?

56:21.280 --> 56:23.360
So four shirts, one pants.

56:23.360 --> 56:24.960
And also one pair of flats.

56:24.960 --> 56:27.080
Oh, we gotta revise the math then.

56:27.080 --> 56:28.080
Okay.

56:28.080 --> 56:29.080
Hold on.

56:29.080 --> 56:30.080
You've changed the whole calculation.

56:30.080 --> 56:31.080
Okay.

56:31.080 --> 56:32.080
You say real person job.

56:32.080 --> 56:33.880
Does that mean five days a week?

56:33.880 --> 56:34.880
Because we're already hitting a snag.

56:34.880 --> 56:35.880
Monday through Thursday, four days.

56:35.880 --> 56:36.880
Oh, then you're fine.

56:36.880 --> 56:41.160
You got a shirt for each day.

56:41.160 --> 56:42.520
Is there a casual day?

56:42.520 --> 56:43.520
No.

56:43.520 --> 56:44.520
Oh, shit.

56:44.520 --> 56:48.040
You do need one other pants.

56:48.040 --> 56:51.560
Not because of like the mix and match kind of thing.

56:51.560 --> 56:52.560
But for chocolate emergencies.

56:52.560 --> 56:53.560
Yeah.

56:53.560 --> 56:54.560
Yeah.

56:54.560 --> 56:57.480
If something goes terribly, terribly wrong, you don't want to be sitting there both embarrassed

56:57.480 --> 57:01.720
because you got to stand on your pants and also at a loss for what to do tomorrow.

57:01.720 --> 57:02.720
Right.

57:02.720 --> 57:06.400
If you spill spaghetti sauce in your pants, your first thought can't be, well, I can't

57:06.400 --> 57:07.400
go to work.

57:07.400 --> 57:08.400
It's not a good-

57:08.400 --> 57:09.400
Gotta fake sick.

57:09.400 --> 57:10.400
Gotta take some PTO.

57:10.400 --> 57:16.280
I mean, you could cut them off and make jean shorts, of course, but that trick works once.

57:16.280 --> 57:20.960
And while people may not notice you wearing the same pair of jeans every day, they will

57:20.960 --> 57:25.360
in fact notice you wearing the same pair of jean shorts every day, which is kind of a

57:25.360 --> 57:27.480
paradox, but it is true.

57:27.480 --> 57:31.160
I actually think maybe lean into this a little bit and like you have four different shirts.

57:31.160 --> 57:36.000
Make one the Monday shirt, one the Tuesday shirt, one the Wednesday shirt, one the Thursday

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
shirt.

57:37.000 --> 57:42.240
But then, two years in, new shirt in the mix.

57:42.240 --> 57:45.160
Everyone's going to compliment new shirt.

57:45.160 --> 57:49.880
Everyone knows it's new shirt because you only got four.

57:49.880 --> 57:54.660
There are very few people in anybody's life who notice when you buy new clothes as evidenced

57:54.660 --> 57:59.680
by the fact that when we were in Atlanta yesterday, I bought this shirt at J. Crew and none of

57:59.680 --> 58:05.800
my family members have said anything about it.

58:05.800 --> 58:07.600
Thank you.

58:07.600 --> 58:12.480
So you're probably good no matter what because people don't care what folks are wearing to

58:12.480 --> 58:17.240
work most of the time unless you work at a Best Buy and you're not wearing the very specific

58:17.240 --> 58:18.240
thing that they request.

58:18.240 --> 58:19.240
No.

58:19.240 --> 58:20.240
That is an excellent point.

58:20.240 --> 58:24.480
I've worked at Best Buy, Sears, and Petsmart and I wore the same thing every day to those

58:24.480 --> 58:25.480
jaws.

58:25.480 --> 58:27.880
And no one was ever like, hmm, blue polo again, huh?

58:27.880 --> 58:30.840
Well, that was a legally mandated blue polo.

58:30.840 --> 58:36.160
And if you start to get nervous, you can kind of punch it up with like maybe a fun brooch.

58:36.160 --> 58:38.160
A kicky shawl.

58:38.160 --> 58:42.240
Kind of a kicky shawl would be nice.

58:42.240 --> 58:43.240
Kind of punch it up.

58:43.240 --> 58:44.240
Did that help?

58:44.240 --> 58:45.240
You're good.

58:45.240 --> 58:46.240
Yeah.

58:46.240 --> 58:47.240
New pants, probably.

58:47.240 --> 58:48.240
Yeah.

58:48.240 --> 58:49.240
You're good.

58:49.240 --> 58:50.240
Ride it out.

58:50.240 --> 58:51.240
All right.

58:51.240 --> 58:54.320
Let's do some a little bit further back.

58:54.320 --> 58:58.240
On the aisle, sitting on the aisle in a blue shirt, waving both their hands, pointing at

58:58.240 --> 58:59.240
your shirt.

58:59.240 --> 59:00.240
Blue shirt in the aisle.

59:00.240 --> 59:01.240
Yep.

59:01.240 --> 59:02.240
Yep.

59:02.240 --> 59:03.240
And then left side.

59:03.240 --> 59:04.240
Left side.

59:04.240 --> 59:05.240
Left side.

59:05.240 --> 59:06.240
Left side.

59:06.240 --> 59:07.760
Somebody's wearing what looks like a pink cardigan over a black shirt.

59:07.760 --> 59:15.120
And I remember we used to do like 50 seat venues and we could just be like, Todd.

59:15.120 --> 59:17.440
Welcome to Terror Dome.

59:17.440 --> 59:18.440
What is your name?

59:18.440 --> 59:19.440
You were here first.

59:19.440 --> 59:20.440
Oh shit.

59:20.440 --> 59:21.440
Oh no.

59:21.440 --> 59:22.440
My name's Faith.

59:22.440 --> 59:23.440
Disqualified.

59:23.440 --> 59:24.440
Faith?

59:24.440 --> 59:25.440
Sorry.

59:25.440 --> 59:30.020
Those are the rules.

59:30.020 --> 59:31.020
What was your name?

59:31.020 --> 59:32.020
Faith.

59:32.020 --> 59:33.020
Faith.

59:33.020 --> 59:34.020
Hi.

59:34.020 --> 59:35.020
Sorry about all of this.

59:35.020 --> 59:36.020
And what's your name?

59:36.020 --> 59:37.020
My name's Lake.

59:37.020 --> 59:38.020
Like the water.

59:38.020 --> 59:39.020
Hi, Lake.

59:39.020 --> 59:40.020
Like the water.

59:40.020 --> 59:41.020
Faith, we'll start with you.

59:41.020 --> 59:42.020
Hold on.

59:42.020 --> 59:43.020
Faith's having her microphone adjusted.

59:43.020 --> 59:44.200
Let's start with Lake.

59:44.200 --> 59:47.520
My stepmom, in her spare time, she makes crafts.

59:47.520 --> 59:54.400
They're usually like designs on pillows or blankets or shirts.

59:54.400 --> 59:58.080
The problem is she likes to put like a signature on them.

59:58.080 --> 01:00:04.160
And what she does is my parents' initials.

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.560
And so it's S and M.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:26.080
Faith, yours better be fucking good.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:29.120
But it's also, I don't think there's much advice that we could do here.

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:32.040
And now you're both just sitting on the edge of the stage, which I'm very into, a very

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:34.000
casual vibe.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.760
Was there a question there or was that just a fun anecdote?

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:38.280
How do you change their names?

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:39.280
What do I do?

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.280
Okay.

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:41.280
I figured that might be you.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:42.280
Faith.

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:43.280
Very, very good.

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.280
Faith.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.280
Hi.

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.280
Hi.

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:47.280
Hi, Faith.

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.280
I have a roommate.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:49.280
Okay.

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.840
She does this thing where she'll start a conversation with me in the living area.

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:56.080
And as she's speaking to me and I'm invested in the conversation-

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.520
She stays there, just doesn't go anywhere because that's-

01:00:58.520 --> 01:00:59.520
No.

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:02.480
She'll do the opposite, actually.

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:07.720
And she'll go into her room and she'll talk to me and close the door as she's speaking.

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:08.720
Okay.

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:09.720
God, that's miserable.

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:10.720
And she'll go, oh, yeah.

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:11.720
I had a chemistry test today.

01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:12.720
It was really hard.

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:20.520
And I was wondering, and I'm just left there wondering, does she want me to seek her out?

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:21.520
Right.

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:22.520
Is that her?

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:23.520
Are we done?

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:24.520
Is that her saying, I don't want to talk anymore?

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:29.280
I thought you were going to say she goes into the turlet and keeps on rocking like nothing's

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.440
going on there.

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:34.520
I feel tempted to go with the S and M quill.

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:38.560
But I don't know that we're going to say anything funnier than the very concept.

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:39.560
Nothing just happened.

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:42.560
Ooh, this is a toughie.

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:46.640
Yeah, I think you just stop talking to your roommate whenever they do this because if

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:52.080
you can't see them, the conversation has ended, and that just seems like a good sort of protocol.

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.080
Is that okay?

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:54.080
Yeah, that'll work.

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:55.080
Okay.

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:56.080
Thank you for your honesty.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.080
Thank you for your honesty.

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.080
I know it wasn't the best.

01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.080
Yeah, you didn't sugarcoat it.

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.080
I appreciate that.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.080
Now, about these S and M quilts.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.080
Yeah.

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:10.120
We actually don't have anything funnier to say than the quilts, so you may actually be...

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:14.880
Was the question, what is your address so I can send you one of these awesome quilts?

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:19.040
Also, is your concern that someone will get this and be like, oh, this is lovely needle

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:20.040
point.

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.040
Flip it over.

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:22.040
What?

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.040
That explains it.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:27.800
Like, I'm pretty sure people won't be confused.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:31.160
What are some of the other things that S and M are stitched onto?

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.160
I mean, the problem...

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:35.160
Thank you, Paul.

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:40.760
Paul's the best.

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:41.760
Other crafts.

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:42.760
What else are we talking about?

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:48.120
I mean, the problem is I got rid of it, but at one point I had a sweater with it on it.

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.120
That fucking rules.

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.120
I'm sorry.

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.440
Everything about your life owns bones.

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.840
You do not need our help.

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:56.720
You just wanted to brag and I love it.

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:57.720
I'm into it for sure.

01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:02.280
It's very good, but it makes me feel bad and small because your life rules.

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:03.280
Yeah.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:07.840
I'm scared because she goes to farmer's markets with quilts that say S and M on them.

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:10.720
And she's incredibly successful because her shit rules.

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:18.760
She makes so much money, even more than the bespoke potato guy down the hall.

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:19.880
We have nothing else for you.

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:20.880
Your shit rules.

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:21.880
Congratulations.

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:22.880
Congratulations.

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:23.880
Well done.

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.240
Our mailbox addresses are listed on the website.

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:28.720
I will make sure to send something if I can.

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:29.720
Thank you.

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:30.720
Thank you.

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:31.720
All right.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:32.720
I'm done picking people.

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:33.720
I've done a lot.

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:34.720
Yeah.

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:35.720
You've done good.

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:39.000
I'm going to say this person over here with the hat from Mario, come on down.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.360
The clothes from Mario also, I think.

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:42.360
Yes.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:43.360
Just a Mario outfit.

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:44.360
Thank you so much.

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:45.360
I'm very into that.

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:46.360
All right.

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:47.360
From the left side.

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:48.360
Okay.

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:52.040
I think it's the Adventure Zone purple shirt with maybe gray hoodie over it, brown hair.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.040
You just look sad.

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.040
I'm pointing at you.

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.040
Yeah.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.040
Yeah.

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.040
You.

01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.040
Yeah.

01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:59.040
The person I'm describing.

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.040
Whoa.

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.040
Okay.

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.040
Oh, it's that whole Mario Odyssey cosplay.

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:05.520
I'm so into that because I'm very excited for Mario Odyssey to come out on Friday.

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:06.520
Same.

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:10.960
And you're cosplaying for it like it's like E3, which seems weird, but also I'm so into

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:15.880
it because I saw you and I was like, oh shit, Friday's going to be a very good day.

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:16.880
I work at GameStop.

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:17.880
Thank you.

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:18.880
Oh, cool.

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:19.880
Excellent.

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:20.880
What's your name?

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:21.880
I am Rebecca.

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:22.880
Hi, Rebecca.

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:23.880
What is your name?

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:24.880
My name is Brianna.

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:25.880
Hi, Brianna.

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:26.880
Rebecca.

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:27.880
Let's go.

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:28.880
Here we go.

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:29.880
Like he says.

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:30.880
Here we go.

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:31.880
Yes.

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:32.880
All right.

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:35.880
My name is Rebecca and I work at GameStop and unfortunately I am very small.

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:36.880
Okay.

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:42.480
And sometimes I have to close alone and while I do live in a pretty safe place, one time

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:44.520
we got burgled while I was there alone.

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:45.520
Hey, I hear you.

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:49.120
Let's talk after this.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:52.000
I was scared pantsless while I was wearing a skirt.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Doesn't matter.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:59.320
Well, I'm not, I'm not very large and scary like someone that should be.

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:02.320
I wish I was so that I wasn't burgled.

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:03.320
It was only like 50 bucks.

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:04.320
Well, you need to understand.

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:05.320
You weren't targeted.

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:07.720
They weren't like, we're going to rob her.

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:12.840
Even big, strong, tough people who look very scary and intimidating can get robbed working

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:15.160
at GameStop.

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:20.200
It happens to even the toughest, surliest looking bad dudes.

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:24.840
I feel like we could solve this pretty easy Good Will Hunting style by, it's not your

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:27.320
fault that you got robbed at GameStop.

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:30.080
You need to understand that.

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:34.400
It is also your job to not be intimidating and then it's your job to be like, you got

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.400
it.

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:36.400
You got it.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.400
Whatever you need.

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.400
Absolutely.

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:39.400
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:40.400
Now your question.

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:41.400
Okay.

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.400
How do I bulk up fast?

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:47.520
I'm going to go rob a GameStop lane.

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:51.120
Where are some easy ones?

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:55.480
I can tell you one that's a pushover guaranteed.

01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:58.200
So what is the question?

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:04.640
I was going to ask, how do I become intimidating without changing my physical self?

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:05.640
No, you don't.

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:12.040
You're approaching this from a, okay, let's do, we'll do yours, but what's, what was your

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:13.040
question?

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:14.040
Okay.

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:18.160
So ever since me and my friends got to our hotel room, weird things have been happening.

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:19.160
Here in Nashville?

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:20.160
Yes.

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:21.160
Okay.

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:26.360
Lights flickering, elevators stuttering, doors getting stuck, and we would just think this

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:31.400
is a sign of a shitty hotel, but there's literally a graveyard across the parking lot.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:32.720
Hell yeah.

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:35.360
Our hotel room is haunted.

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:39.240
What is the protocol for dealing with this ghost?

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:40.560
Move hotel rooms.

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:41.560
Yeah.

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:42.560
Ask for it.

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:43.560
That's money.

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:47.520
Well, that's money is a really good, that should be a catchphrase of my bim bam for

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.640
like the thing you've said won't work.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:51.640
That's money.

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:52.640
That's money.

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:53.640
Hmm.

01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:54.640
Okay.

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.680
Which, who can we help?

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:57.680
Shit.

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:58.680
Shit.

01:06:58.680 --> 01:06:59.680
Ghosts are real.

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:00.680
Ghosts are real.

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:01.680
Burglary is also wicked real.

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.280
Burglary is also real.

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:04.880
It's like a mad real.

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:10.480
I feel like though, if we give advice, anything burgle related that we could be called to

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:13.640
testify at some point in the future.

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:15.800
There is no ghost court, right?

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:20.200
Like we're not gonna, we're not gonna be held liable.

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:22.280
Uh, I don't know.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:27.480
Anything burgled sucked a lot and, but there's like nothing you, you, all joking aside, there's

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:30.160
nothing you could have done about that.

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:31.800
There's nothing you should have done about that.

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:33.280
So you're like good.

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:38.680
There is no amount of intimidating I think an employee can be that someone who is decided

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:45.540
to rob a store will walk in and go, no, you know what, actually I'll come back tomorrow.

01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:48.520
They've already decided to rob it.

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:49.520
Yeah.

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:51.000
Uh, yeah.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.480
Is that, is that okay?

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:53.480
You're all right.

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:54.480
I hope you're doing okay.

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:55.480
Genuinely.

01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:56.480
Yeah.

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:57.800
I just, I don't care if they rob it.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:58.800
Just not while I'm there.

01:07:58.800 --> 01:07:59.800
Well, that's not a great.

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:00.800
Okay.

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:01.800
Thank you so much for coming.

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:02.800
Okay.

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:03.800
You're really embodying the spirit of Mario.

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:04.800
As long as I get to mine.

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:05.800
As long as it happens to Greg.

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:22.680
It's a not me, it's a not me.

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:24.680
Mario it happened again.

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:25.680
Okay.

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:28.080
I was at home.

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:31.940
Go to the cafeteria or whatever at the hotel.

01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:34.760
Get some salt, circle of salt, duns out.

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:35.760
Okay.

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:38.800
Because even if it doesn't work, the ghost will see the circle of salt and be like, they

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:40.800
know what's up.

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:46.080
You do not want an active player as a ghost, even if the stuff doesn't work.

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.520
You don't want someone who's engaged in battling you.

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:49.520
That's the last thing.

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:52.740
Because if you live forever as a spectral form, I think you're probably going to walk

01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:56.680
pretty cautiously when it comes to like, oops, I could get banished.

01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.520
You're probably pretty careful about that shit.

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:01.000
You see a circle of salt, you're like, not worth it.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.040
So you have to kind of pity a hotel room ghost, because human beings are their absolute worst

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:07.400
in a hotel room.

01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:09.280
You would think like, no, at home they're most comfortable.

01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:10.280
No, no, no.

01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:12.760
I walk in, I throw my stuff around.

01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:15.960
I just drop shit, half empty cup, I just fuck it.

01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:20.520
It's like not quite rockstar parting, just so much as just like human animal.

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:23.560
Ghostbusters is so buck wild.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:28.080
Because if you are a spiritual being that can live forever, and you want to probably

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:33.520
protect that, the last thing you're going to want to do is go fight or spook or pull

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:38.200
pranks on the only people that can kill a ghost.

01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:42.280
Sorry, that has nothing to do with what you said.

01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:43.280
It is true.

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.280
It is very true.

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:50.380
It's like, it's weird because any ghost that you see stay to do battle with the Ghostbusters

01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:52.680
is fucked up beyond belief.

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:55.960
That's actually like the baddest ghost that you do not want to mess with.

01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:00.360
Because there's like four people on earth that can fuck with them, and they are choosing

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:02.600
to pick a fight with those four people.

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:03.600
Just leave.

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:08.720
Just go to like another room or another, just another anywhere.

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:11.080
There's only four of them, and you're in New York.

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:12.080
There's plenty of space.

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:13.080
There's plenty of places to haunt.

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:14.080
Fly up into space.

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.080
You're a ghost.

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:16.080
Forget about it.

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:20.280
Do you think the first, like a big group of ghosts like stood against the Ghostbusters?

01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:23.920
They're like, we're asking you now.

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:30.200
And then like they busted the first ghost, and like the other six, you were like, shit.

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:33.000
This is not anything.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Circle of Salt.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
You're good.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
You're good.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000
That's fine.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Thank you so much.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Glad we could help.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Want to wrap up?

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Yeah.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Let's wrap up.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Thank you all so much.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000
That was very fun, by the way.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.440
I think we're going to do that from now on, but we're going to wrap the show up.

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:48.440
Thank you all so, so, so much for being here.

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:51.440
You all have been so cool.

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:55.400
A couple of things real quick before we go, we forgot to mention this last night.

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.000
We'll mention it tomorrow night, too.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.960
But as long as we have a captive audience, we are putting out an Adventure Zone graphic

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:01.960
novel.

01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:02.960
Yes.

01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:03.960
It's theadventurezonecomic.com.

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:11.560
You all don't know what the Adventure Zone is, but the crowd tomorrow is going to fuck

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:12.560
up.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:13.560
Yeah.

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.640
Also, we do want to say, we already thanked him once.

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:17.640
We'll thank him again.

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:18.640
Paul Seborn.

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:19.640
Thank you, Paul.

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:20.640
Amazing.

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:22.480
Paul should go check out Paul and Storm.

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:23.900
If you aren't already fans, you should become them.

01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:25.920
We assume that you are already.

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:28.320
Thank you to Schmanners for opening for us today.

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.320
Thank you, Schmanners.

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:32.480
Thank you to the Tennessee Performing Arts Center.

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:38.360
This place is very cool, and I'm very excited that we are doing another show here tomorrow.

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:39.360
Thank you, Nashville.

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.360
Thank you, Nashville.

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:41.360
Thank you, Nashville.

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:44.000
Thank you, John Roderick and the Long Winters for the Use Your Theme Song.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.600
It's a departure of the album, Putting the Days to bed.

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:46.600
It's very good.

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:47.600
Thank you to Max Funner for having us.

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:49.200
We mentioned posters by Louis Armstrong.

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.200
Thank you, Louis.

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:51.200
Thank you, Max Funner.

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:52.200
Thank you, Max Funner.

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:53.200
Yeah, that's...

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:58.480
Oh, we wish we could, but we are unable to do a meet and greet after the show because

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:01.580
we have another show to do tomorrow, and we have babies and children.

01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:02.920
I took a nap backstage.

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:04.320
My body is dead.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:07.760
That salad revived me, but the salad juice is just gone.

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:11.200
So we won't be able to do that, but you're all great.

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:14.280
We're so sorry that we're old and boring and waxed.

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:15.280
We suck.

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:16.280
Idiots.

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:17.280
How about that...

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:18.280
Half dead.

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.280
Thank you.

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:23.960
Thank you. How about this finally a bunch of you met our dad at Walgreens?

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:27.720
That's something right

01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:34.000
Like dad wasn't just waiting at Walgreens just like getting band-aids and free nose

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.960
