00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.600
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern

00:47.600 --> 00:51.120
era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

00:51.120 --> 00:57.120
I'm your baby-est baby baby Griffin McElroy. Ladies and gentlemen, we're here with a breaking,

00:57.120 --> 01:05.360
not really breaking, breaking update from the CBN news desk, and that is the Cake Boss news

01:05.360 --> 01:13.040
news desk. A hot story from the great state of New Jersey. New Jersey just still trying to get

01:13.040 --> 01:24.640
all of the particulars in order. Here's what we do know right now. Cake Boss was arrested on DWI

01:24.640 --> 01:35.440
charges in Manhattan, driving, swerving around near Hudson Yards. DWI of course standing for

01:35.440 --> 01:45.600
driving while I'm the Cake Boss. Right. Just so you know, prosecutors say that when arrested,

01:46.320 --> 01:53.280
the Cake Boss said, and this is not a goof, this is not us generating the story. Travis,

01:53.280 --> 01:59.120
do you know this? Do you know what he said? You can't arrest me. I'm the Cake Boss.

02:00.880 --> 02:06.720
You can't arrest me. I'm the Cake Boss. Which would have been great if all the police officers

02:06.720 --> 02:12.400
had all gone, oh shit, you're right. I forgot about that. He's got diplomatic immunity, guys.

02:12.400 --> 02:20.560
He mastered cake. We forgot about Roe v. Betty Crocker. Yeah. His life has officially become the

02:20.560 --> 02:30.000
first act of a Nicolas Cage movie. Like Weather Man, Family Man, Cake Man. This is the third of

02:30.000 --> 02:36.480
his Man trilogy. Now to be fair, it actually is a case without precedent because he was driving a

02:36.480 --> 02:43.040
car that was actually a cake that he baked. Yeah. So it's not like, how do you get a Corvette cake

02:43.040 --> 02:50.880
up to 80? I think that's impressive enough. He stepped out of the cake car, fucking sloshed,

02:50.880 --> 02:56.800
fucking slaughtered. It's a wrong cake car. And then the police officers were like,

02:56.800 --> 03:01.600
listen, Cake Boss, I hate to do this. You are a national treasure, but I have to take you to the

03:01.600 --> 03:06.000
pokey because you're drunk. And then he ate the car in one bite and said, prove I was driving.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.080
What car? Prove I was driving. What car? Look behind you, a fat kid just ate it.

03:10.080 --> 03:14.400
Yeah. I think that when Cake Boss is though, I mean, we all laugh, but

03:15.360 --> 03:24.560
if Cake Boss is in a car made of cake, he technically has diplomatic immunity in a cake

03:25.440 --> 03:34.720
that he has constructed. So his Cake Boss, Bonifides, hold up because he is inside a

03:34.720 --> 03:43.680
cake. He is in fact the boss. Bon appetites. His Bon appetites, hold up because he's inside a cake.

03:43.680 --> 03:47.280
Do you think when he got out of the car, the cops were really afraid that he would touch them and

03:47.280 --> 03:54.800
they would turn into cake? That's the only reason that he can turn out cakes at such a high speed

03:54.800 --> 04:01.120
and volume is that he's telling my God, the cakes have been people the whole time. You listen to me,

04:01.120 --> 04:06.880
pigs. Don't make me take off the gloves. Don't make me take off the gloves that protect my

04:06.880 --> 04:14.080
magic cake hands. Why isn't it working? Why isn't it working? God, I'm drunk.

04:17.600 --> 04:21.760
Oh, Cake Boss, Cake Boss. Maybe, should we practice? Should we like,

04:21.760 --> 04:27.440
because I think we're assuming a lot when you read on paper and you know what? They used

04:27.440 --> 04:32.240
exclamation points in the quote, which is like a journalistic no-no because it's a leading

04:32.240 --> 04:36.720
punctuation, right? Because the way that it's written now, you read it and you think it's like,

04:36.720 --> 04:41.520
you can't arrest me, I'm the Cake Boss, angry like that. But what if it was like kind of sweet,

04:41.520 --> 04:47.280
like, ah, come on, guys. Come on, guys, you can't arrest me, I'm the Cake Boss.

04:47.920 --> 04:51.280
Or what if the like just the punctuation was all wrong and he said, you can't,

04:51.280 --> 04:58.480
oh God, arrest me, I'm the Cake Boss. Put me in jail for pastry crimes.

04:58.480 --> 05:01.200
Stop me before I bake again. Oh God.

05:02.400 --> 05:11.600
So this is an advice ship where we try to help Cake Boss navigate the choppy waters of his life.

05:12.800 --> 05:17.360
But let's get to actually helping people because I want to get my help on today.

05:17.360 --> 05:22.080
Okay. What is the proper etiquette when showering in someone else's home?

05:23.440 --> 05:29.280
Are soap slash shampoo slash other shower equipment up for grabs? Is there some sort

05:29.280 --> 05:33.520
of unspoken line like shower gel is okay to borrow but someone's bar soap is gross?

05:34.240 --> 05:39.200
Or is using anything in someone else's shower unacceptable? And I'm basically a social pariah

05:39.200 --> 05:43.120
for even having to ask this question. That's from Befuddled in Baltimore.

05:43.120 --> 05:48.640
I was thinking that we'd answered this question before, and we may have. Time is a fucking flat

05:48.640 --> 05:52.960
circle. And we've been doing this for like 800 years. But I think I was actually thinking of

05:52.960 --> 06:00.720
like episode two, which was 223 episodes ago, where we talked about peeing in the shower at

06:00.720 --> 06:02.800
somebody else's house. Right.

06:02.800 --> 06:08.560
And I'm almost certain that we probably wang that one. And time and maturity would allow us to come

06:08.560 --> 06:13.840
up with a much better answer. So I guess this is new territory. And I'd say, yeah, go for it.

06:16.080 --> 06:23.920
I think the line is what touches the body. So like, oh, yeah.

06:26.080 --> 06:29.440
Liquid soap? Yes. Loofah? No.

06:29.440 --> 06:33.840
Here's the thing. I want to go with you. I want to say yes, Justin. I want to agree.

06:34.480 --> 06:37.120
But I know that I've used other people's loofahs before.

06:37.120 --> 06:39.440
There. There. I said it.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.440
You haven't used it. Not my loofah.

06:41.440 --> 06:42.480
Certainly not mine.

06:42.480 --> 06:47.360
You're applying water and soap to it. Like you're inherently washing it as you wash yourself.

06:49.200 --> 06:53.040
Unless you have just gotten back from like working in a slaughterhouse,

06:53.040 --> 06:55.360
what horrible things are you scraping off your body?

06:56.160 --> 06:58.560
Ball. Ball essence.

06:58.560 --> 07:02.400
Ball essence. Slivers of balls.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.440
Well, then otherwise you're just going to use their fancy products and put them in like the

07:05.440 --> 07:08.400
palm of your hand and scrub yourself like a Neanderthal.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.200
Yeah. Yes.

07:09.200 --> 07:13.600
Yes. That's how I've been bathing myself. I can't even have a loofah in my home anymore

07:13.600 --> 07:17.760
because sometimes you're at my house and God knows you might just slip up there.

07:17.760 --> 07:20.240
Slip up there and treat yourself to a little scrubby scrub.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.280
Well, I bathed several times a day.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.040
That's true.

07:25.040 --> 07:28.880
I think that staying at someone's house and using their shower products,

07:28.880 --> 07:33.440
let's take loofahs out of the equation, is like staying at a hotel and use it.

07:33.440 --> 07:37.040
Like because then where else do you draw the line? Because if you say no,

07:37.040 --> 07:40.240
then do you just get in and use water and pretend like that's it?

07:42.640 --> 07:48.320
No. Okay. First off, maybe you have some special soap that you like.

07:49.360 --> 07:53.760
That's going to be the problem. I got that in my birch box yesterday.

07:53.760 --> 07:59.520
I was really looking forward to using that plush tea tree oil shampoo and now it's all gone.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.280
Now it's gone. Gonzo.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.360
You drank it? God damn it.

08:04.960 --> 08:08.320
God damn it, Cake Paws. You have a problem. Get out of my house.

08:08.880 --> 08:13.360
Why did I ever let you in here? No, I mean, but this is the thing, right?

08:13.360 --> 08:17.200
With everything like this, there's always a double standard.

08:17.200 --> 08:24.480
There is what we, the hosts of a comedy advice podcast will tell you.

08:25.200 --> 08:29.600
There's what you're going to do when no one's looking, which is always going to be different.

08:29.600 --> 08:35.600
But we all have our little secrets that we do in the secret behind the curtain.

08:36.800 --> 08:43.760
Is it too much for us to ask that everybody who listens to this show live their lives through the

08:43.760 --> 08:48.640
lens of imagining that we are constantly watching them wherever they are,

08:48.640 --> 08:51.440
wherever they are, no matter what they're doing, our eyes are on you.

08:52.400 --> 08:55.600
And it's like a judgment thing. It's not like a sexy thing. Okay.

08:55.600 --> 08:59.120
It can be if that's, it won't be for us. It's imaginary in your brain.

08:59.120 --> 09:02.560
If you want it to be a sexy thing, go ahead. It's your play space.

09:03.120 --> 09:10.880
Ooh, I just had an idea. This could be what all of those hotel baths and so, you know,

09:10.880 --> 09:17.280
the soaps and stuff that you steal are for like make a little basket, keep it in your linen

09:17.280 --> 09:21.520
closet. And then when you have guests stay with you, like you set it out, like you set out their

09:21.520 --> 09:26.800
towels and washcloths and stuff. What is the, I, but I just don't have any,

09:26.800 --> 09:30.880
I don't have any problem with somebody using my shampoo, like use my shampoo and conditioner,

09:30.880 --> 09:37.360
treat yourself. Don't rub things on your things that go on my things. I want no thing to think.

09:37.360 --> 09:42.160
You should cross stitch that over your toilet. Yeah. Keep your things off my things.

09:42.160 --> 09:47.200
Keep your things off my things. Ebola is real. Here's another factor that we're not considering

09:47.200 --> 09:51.760
is that my, my labs, shower products have a very distinctive smell.

09:51.760 --> 09:58.480
Um, and if Travis walks out of the master bathroom at the, at the Griffin and Rachel McElroy estate,

09:58.480 --> 10:04.960
um, smelling like my bath, I'm going to be fucking furious with you.

10:04.960 --> 10:08.400
Are you afraid that you'll just like Pavlovian response become aroused?

10:08.960 --> 10:12.080
You'll be attracted to me in a weird way and you won't be able to put your finger on it.

10:12.560 --> 10:15.520
I'll be able to put my finger directly on it. Um,

10:15.520 --> 10:20.720
Can we go one fucking week on the show without one of us trying to ramp up the sexual tension?

10:20.720 --> 10:28.640
I refuse to let this become a Ross and Ross and Rachel show. This is not happening.

10:28.640 --> 10:34.160
It's it's, it's our Tumblr slash fiction game is falling off. There just are not enough

10:34.800 --> 10:38.800
fans shipping us and it's a problem and our stock is slipping.

10:40.240 --> 10:47.280
That's what people want. Maybe in our webisodes, our webisodes that you can get with our companion

10:47.280 --> 10:52.160
app that don't exist. Don't, don't tell people that it doesn't exist. Uh, do you guys know Yahoo?

10:52.960 --> 10:55.120
Absolutely. I'm cleaning my glasses real quick.

10:56.560 --> 10:57.200
Dramatically.

10:58.960 --> 11:02.240
Hold on. I couldn't see the screen cause my glasses were dirty.

11:02.240 --> 11:04.080
Okay. You guys ready for Yahoo?

11:04.800 --> 11:06.720
Yep. Go for it. Dirty boy.

11:06.720 --> 11:13.440
Um, this Yahoo was sent in by Sarah Benson. Thank you, Sarah. Uh, it's by Yahoo answers user Nathan,

11:13.440 --> 11:19.520
who asks, what should you do when you see your principal by beer?

11:22.000 --> 11:28.480
What should you do when you see your principal by beer? And I, I hit that hard P there,

11:28.480 --> 11:32.400
that plosive P, um, because they spelled the goddamn word wrong.

11:33.600 --> 11:38.320
That's how you know that it's by the way, a legit Yahoo answers and off some fakey, fake,

11:38.320 --> 11:45.200
jokey joke bullshit is if they spell a word wrong, usually it's a 12 year old. Um, this Nathan,

11:45.200 --> 11:51.040
by the way, has been a member since October 31st, 2014. So something tells me Nathan was maybe at

11:51.040 --> 11:57.920
the speed speedway on Halloween and saw his principal getting ready to get fucking wrecked.

11:58.800 --> 12:05.840
Okay. I think about this and at first I want to jump to like, Oh, you stupid. But then I think

12:05.840 --> 12:11.280
about what if I was 12 and I saw my principal in the wild, like buying beer, like I would have

12:11.280 --> 12:16.240
thought that was scandalous. I would have thought he might as well like be buying crystal math.

12:16.240 --> 12:19.840
Here's a weird thought exercise for everybody. Think about all the times that you've seen

12:19.840 --> 12:24.160
teachers in the wild. We've all done that. We've all, I feel like we talked about that on the show

12:24.160 --> 12:30.640
that none of them ever remember us, which is devastating. Um, nobody ever sees a principal

12:30.640 --> 12:36.320
in the wild. It just doesn't happen. They are the fucking scariest human beings on earth when

12:36.320 --> 12:41.920
you're 12 years old and they don't exist outside of the school. They're fucking holograms projected

12:41.920 --> 12:48.720
by the ghost heart of the school. That was always the weird thing about, um, the principal.

12:48.720 --> 12:55.040
Like when I, when I was in school, they seem to be in another, like I didn't get sent to the

12:55.040 --> 13:00.080
principal's office, right? I was a good kid, but there did seem to be kids that, um, got sent to

13:00.080 --> 13:04.320
the principal's office a lot that seemed to have developed. Like whenever I'd walk by and see them

13:04.320 --> 13:10.240
in there, there seemed to be some sort of comradery in there. Yeah. Like a principal. Yeah. For like

13:10.240 --> 13:15.200
the repeat offenders, they seem to like hang out a lot and that they had developed some sort of

13:15.200 --> 13:19.520
affinity for them. I was always a little jealous, but I wasn't going to like live the life that

13:19.520 --> 13:23.280
demanded me in the principal's office. Do you think that after a while it becomes like yours

13:23.280 --> 13:28.720
in the principal's secret tea time and it's like, see you back again tomorrow at 11. Yep.

13:28.720 --> 13:32.160
Yep. I know you hate math, Jim. I'll see you down here.

13:32.880 --> 13:38.720
As, um, as sort of earth shattering, as it might've been to see my principal buying beer

13:38.720 --> 13:43.440
when I was a kid, I think I would run an equal risk of having my perception shipped to them

13:44.000 --> 13:52.320
now as an adult, seeing what beer they buy, right? That is very, that is like, if I,

13:52.320 --> 13:57.440
if I'm walking in and like this person who has been sort of an authority figure, almost a,

13:57.440 --> 14:04.480
uh, a messianic figure in my life. And I see them with a, like a case of beast.

14:04.480 --> 14:11.360
Like I can't, I can't with this, with this. Is Mr. Lake buying a cube of Mike's hard lemonade?

14:11.360 --> 14:18.800
Is that a cube of limeritas? I hope that's for like a party and not just for him. Certainly

14:18.800 --> 14:24.000
he's not just buying like 24 for himself. Tell me you're fucking buying ironic

14:24.000 --> 14:29.040
cramberitas. Cause I cannot, I cannot see you as an authority figure.

14:29.040 --> 14:32.560
Does he have just a bag of buzz balls? Is he okay?

14:32.560 --> 14:38.000
Where did Mrs. Scott even find Four Loko? Is that Five Loko?

14:38.000 --> 14:43.360
Is that Five Loko, an illegal and even more illegal version of Four Loko that they only

14:43.360 --> 14:47.440
sell to principals? If I don't go to sleep, Monday can't come.

14:47.440 --> 14:56.240
Oh shit. That should be the fucking slogan of Sparks

14:56.240 --> 15:01.360
and Four Loko. If you don't go to sleep, Monday can't come.

15:01.360 --> 15:06.880
Um, I would say you maybe do a little bit of extortion here and you walk up and you say,

15:06.880 --> 15:12.320
hey Mrs. Scott, those Five Locos look tall and delicious and you're going to have a really

15:12.320 --> 15:16.160
great time with them, but I am going to put you on blast come Monday. Unless maybe you sign me

15:16.160 --> 15:20.880
and Bryce here a couple of cans and then you and Bryce go and you squirrel them away in,

15:20.880 --> 15:24.320
in his loft. And then it's your secret treasure forever.

15:25.360 --> 15:25.840
It's weird.

15:25.840 --> 15:30.880
You got to go, you got to go house of cards. You got to take the picture with your camera first

15:31.440 --> 15:36.160
and then say, oh, it would be such a shame if this got Snapchat and if it got Snapchat,

15:36.160 --> 15:41.840
you would have no idea of how to access it or find it or anything. Cause Snapchat is a secret.

15:41.840 --> 15:46.160
And, and then you go eat some ribs. I haven't seen very much of the show.

15:48.080 --> 15:53.520
And then you go to the poker tournament. It's cause it's cards. It's weird to me. I'm sitting

15:53.520 --> 15:58.800
here thinking like there's so many like stereotypes and thoughts that we all have about teachers.

15:58.800 --> 15:59.280
Yeah.

15:59.280 --> 16:00.400
I don't really have those.

16:00.400 --> 16:04.240
Anything about principles and principles are just like super teachers. They're teachers who

16:04.240 --> 16:05.440
fucking evolved.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.920
Because I wanted to say like, isn't it,

16:07.920 --> 16:12.720
isn't it like the principal's right and duty to have a beer because he's got to deal with

16:12.720 --> 16:17.280
kids all day long. And then I was like, wait, hold on. Who's just saying that they do. Maybe

16:17.280 --> 16:20.080
they're sitting there going, I hope someone gets in trouble today.

16:20.080 --> 16:24.320
New segment on the show. Principal watch. If you are a principal listening to the show,

16:24.320 --> 16:27.440
or you're in close contact with the principal outside of a school setting,

16:27.440 --> 16:32.800
give us the dirt. We want to know all your principal stories. Principal watch.

16:32.800 --> 16:38.560
Is it, I feel like every school I went to, the standard was that the principal was like this

16:39.360 --> 16:45.760
totally hands-off leader that nobody ever saw except at like pep rallies. But the vice principal

16:45.760 --> 16:51.040
was a fucking badass that would like wreck you if you stepped out of line. Like that was the

16:51.040 --> 16:52.800
person that you really had to be afraid of.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.920
Man, I would go drunk. I would go power mad.

16:55.920 --> 16:56.420
Yeah.

16:56.420 --> 17:03.620
I would. I would. You know, I always judged, you know, you judge the vice principal. It's very easy

17:03.620 --> 17:07.700
to judge the vice principal when you're young. Like, oh, that guy's such a creep. I would be

17:08.340 --> 17:10.180
the absolute worst.

17:10.180 --> 17:16.500
How, how can we never hear more about vice principals conspiring to kill the principal

17:16.500 --> 17:17.220
to become them?

17:20.180 --> 17:22.900
Just, why don't we hear more about that? It's 2014.

17:22.900 --> 17:27.940
The answer is that of course they are a ghost that is projected by the ghost heart of the school.

17:27.940 --> 17:30.500
Everyone knows this. This is common. How about another question?

17:31.780 --> 17:34.340
There's a guy at work who I get the feeling is into me.

17:35.140 --> 17:39.860
However, I'm not keen on dating a coworker and I've told him this. He's smart. He's funny.

17:39.860 --> 17:46.100
He's charming. And we match really well. He would be perfect for me except for the work thing.

17:46.100 --> 17:47.700
And I'm not super attracted to him.

17:47.700 --> 17:48.420
Well then.

17:48.420 --> 17:50.260
So just those two things.

17:50.260 --> 17:55.940
Let me just as one, I am starting to like him more as we become friends.

17:56.660 --> 18:01.140
My girlfriend warned, this is the, by the way, your grandkids are going to love this meat.

18:01.140 --> 18:01.700
Cute.

18:01.700 --> 18:05.860
Wow. What a fucking sweeping romance this is.

18:06.740 --> 18:12.740
My girlfriend warned me. He may be doing the wear down method, the passive aggressive.

18:12.740 --> 18:17.460
Maybe she'll see me as something more one day method. Is that real?

18:17.460 --> 18:20.900
I kind of think it's starting to work. What should I do, brothers?

18:20.900 --> 18:24.500
That's from can't decide in Canada. I cannot believe you've done this.

18:24.500 --> 18:26.180
I can't believe you've done this.

18:26.180 --> 18:32.180
I can't believe works for 226 episodes to convince people not to do this thing you're talking about.

18:32.180 --> 18:34.020
And now you're reinforcing this thing.

18:34.020 --> 18:35.380
Now you're done doing it.

18:35.380 --> 18:37.540
Is this a thing? Of course it's a thing.

18:37.540 --> 18:41.300
And well, is it a thing though?

18:41.300 --> 18:43.300
It's the ducky. I call it the ducky.

18:44.420 --> 18:46.980
I can't think of the method as anything other than the ducky.

18:46.980 --> 18:51.620
The, the, is this good enough? That's what ducky sounds like in my mind. I haven't seen the movie.

18:52.260 --> 18:56.820
Um, I, it's just like, it's, is it, is it a thing?

18:56.820 --> 19:00.100
I don't, I think I'm uncomfortable with the term wear down because that,

19:00.100 --> 19:03.380
that intimates that there's like, I don't know that you have this thick,

19:04.500 --> 19:12.020
thick lustrous chitin that, that this person is eroding by just like being, being nice, I guess.

19:12.820 --> 19:14.740
Griffin, let me put it in this context.

19:14.740 --> 19:20.820
If you are just friends with the person, um, and by you, I mean the person that would, uh,

19:20.820 --> 19:25.380
do the wear down, quote unquote, if you were just friends with no ulterior motive,

19:25.380 --> 19:28.900
and then one day take both of you kind of realize you have feelings for each other,

19:28.900 --> 19:31.940
then you're just getting to know each other and you grow closer together.

19:31.940 --> 19:35.620
If you have feelings for the person from the beginning and they tell you that you're not

19:35.620 --> 19:40.660
interested and you put all your effort and set your sights onto convincing them to like you,

19:40.660 --> 19:44.820
that's called the wearing down, like there's no other word for it in my mind than like,

19:44.820 --> 19:46.020
I'm going to wear them down.

19:46.020 --> 19:49.300
But it doesn't, I mean, there's nothing in this question though that makes it sound like they're,

19:49.300 --> 19:53.460
except for the fact that the, the friend thinks that he's wearing them down, but based on what

19:53.460 --> 20:00.580
this question asker has said, she, she gets the feeling that he's into her and he, she told him

20:00.580 --> 20:06.260
that he's not, she's, oh Christ, she doesn't want to date a coworker, right? But it doesn't,

20:06.260 --> 20:11.700
she didn't say like, and then like, he keeps buying me chocolate. It's not, you know?

20:11.700 --> 20:15.860
I guess the weird factor in here is like, if you're not super attracted to him,

20:15.860 --> 20:19.780
when you say you're just like starting to like him more, do you mean like as a person,

20:19.780 --> 20:22.420
like he's fun to be around and you enjoy his friendship?

20:23.620 --> 20:28.900
Because unless like you become more and more attracted to him along with liking him more,

20:28.900 --> 20:31.540
then that just means you're becoming friends with someone.

20:31.540 --> 20:35.540
I think, I think the idea of the wear down method is gross. So we've talked about that before of

20:35.540 --> 20:41.860
like approaching friendship with the ultimate ulterior motive of I'm, I'm trying to hit that.

20:42.420 --> 20:48.340
Please, please may I hit it? That sucks, right? That's rough. But don't like, don't let yourself

20:48.340 --> 20:55.140
be so skeptical of a person's like friendliness that you just like immediately assume like,

20:55.140 --> 20:59.140
oh, you're trying to hit this, please. Do you know, do you know how you know?

20:59.140 --> 21:03.060
How do you know, Joe? It's in his jokes. It's in his jokes.

21:03.060 --> 21:09.140
Stop it. It's not, it is because, because if like he's occasionally dropping something like,

21:09.140 --> 21:13.460
well, I guess we look pretty cute together today, huh? Oh, matching sweaters. Like that kind of

21:13.460 --> 21:19.860
thing. Then it's like, Oh, okay. He's like testing the waters with those jokes to see how you respond

21:19.860 --> 21:25.140
to them. That's I think like the greatest clue that someone is trying to do the quote unquote

21:25.140 --> 21:29.460
wear down. Like this is a challenge because I act like I'm into everybody.

21:29.460 --> 21:30.100
Yeah.

21:30.100 --> 21:32.740
Man and woman. That's just me. You know?

21:32.740 --> 21:36.660
Animal, animal, mineral, vegetable, plasma.

21:36.660 --> 21:39.780
I'm a flirt machine. I'll flirt with anything. I don't care.

21:39.780 --> 21:41.460
Justin flirted with the sun yesterday.

21:42.020 --> 21:47.700
I flirted with the sun like Icarus. He flirted with failure.

21:48.820 --> 21:50.340
We're all flirting with failure here.

21:52.340 --> 21:56.420
I think that should be the name of the show. Um, I, it sounds like she's overthinking this

21:56.420 --> 22:03.220
maybe he or she, I guess I should say, cause it's not, it's not, uh, quantified here. Um,

22:03.220 --> 22:08.820
it sounds like maybe overthinking it. Like maybe just kind of like go with it,

22:08.820 --> 22:12.740
go with the flow and see, see how you feel. But like, I don't know.

22:12.740 --> 22:16.260
Just do what you're comfortable. Just be, just do what you're comfortable with.

22:17.620 --> 22:21.700
And if it becomes clear that he is still interested in you,

22:21.700 --> 22:25.700
whether he's wearing you down or not, that's not important. If it becomes clear that he's

22:25.700 --> 22:30.100
still interested in you and you are not interested in him or interested in dating a coworker,

22:30.100 --> 22:33.620
then maybe you just need to stop spending so much time with him or, I mean,

22:33.620 --> 22:36.420
you've already said it to him that you're not interested in dating a coworker.

22:36.420 --> 22:40.420
So if he doesn't listen to that, then you just need to stop spending time with him.

22:40.420 --> 22:42.260
If you don't want to spend time with him anymore,

22:42.260 --> 22:45.140
like you're under no obligation to become closer with this dude.

22:46.420 --> 22:50.660
It's weird because this is actually two kind of issues that are being dealt with here.

22:50.660 --> 22:56.660
On the one hand, it's this idea of the wear down, but on the other, it's this,

22:57.460 --> 23:04.580
the idea of not dating a coworker. So, I mean, I don't know if your resolve is slipping there.

23:04.580 --> 23:10.260
Like if that's sort of the issue or it's just your feelings in general for him.

23:10.260 --> 23:14.340
Because I think that your rule about not dating a coworker is like the best.

23:14.340 --> 23:16.260
It's very, it's a rule.

23:16.260 --> 23:17.860
That can be very sexy.

23:17.860 --> 23:20.020
It can be.

23:20.020 --> 23:24.100
I do think, however, that that rule falls into the same kind of category for me as when people say,

23:24.100 --> 23:28.180
like, I'm just want to focus on schoolwork or I'm just not looking for a relationship right now.

23:28.180 --> 23:32.660
Like it's a really good rule to have until you like meet that person who just blows you away.

23:32.660 --> 23:34.420
Because what if it's love?

23:34.420 --> 23:35.220
What if it's love?

23:35.220 --> 23:35.940
That's what I'm saying.

23:35.940 --> 23:36.660
How about a Yahoo?

23:37.220 --> 23:37.620
Okay.

23:37.620 --> 23:41.460
This Yahoo was sent in by Rachel Sperling, who has been killing it lately.

23:41.460 --> 23:44.420
Game, recognize game, Rachel Sperling.

23:45.380 --> 23:47.300
Yahoo answers user mobile.

23:47.300 --> 23:55.940
Uh, member since November 13th, 2014.

23:56.740 --> 23:59.700
The Yahoo answer service is fucking expanding.

23:59.700 --> 24:00.980
Is blowing up.

24:00.980 --> 24:02.020
New users.

24:02.020 --> 24:07.460
Mobile asks, what happens if I drink water without interruption?

24:07.460 --> 24:09.380
Would my pee keep going?

24:09.380 --> 24:10.980
Could I pee like this forever?

24:13.940 --> 24:15.300
Could I pee like that?

24:15.300 --> 24:19.620
Could I, is it possible that I could pee like this?

24:19.620 --> 24:20.660
Dream come true.

24:23.140 --> 24:25.940
I don't want to close my eyes.

24:27.620 --> 24:29.860
I don't want to stop this pee.

24:29.860 --> 24:30.660
Oh man.

24:30.660 --> 24:34.660
Could you just turn yourself into a beautiful Greco Roman fountain?

24:34.660 --> 24:38.740
We learned from Austin Powers, the spy who shagged me that if you drink some water,

24:38.740 --> 24:40.500
you can immediately start peeing again.

24:41.940 --> 24:42.260
What?

24:42.260 --> 24:46.980
What he does that in a scene cause he unplugs the fountain and then he's worried the guard

24:46.980 --> 24:48.980
will notice that the fountains not on anymore.

24:49.860 --> 24:50.020
Yeah.

24:50.020 --> 24:51.540
And he's eating some asparagus in there.

24:51.540 --> 24:55.540
And then that's how he gets caught because the guard can smell the asparagus and his

24:55.540 --> 24:58.740
pee that he just ate and immediately peed out.

24:58.740 --> 24:59.140
Two questions.

24:59.140 --> 25:01.300
Why did they stop making these movies?

25:01.300 --> 25:01.940
Fuck me.

25:03.620 --> 25:05.540
God damn comedy gold.

25:05.540 --> 25:08.340
And we just, we just decided to leave that gold buried.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.180
And I want to clarify a correction.

25:10.180 --> 25:11.380
It was in gold member.

25:11.380 --> 25:11.700
Okay.

25:11.700 --> 25:12.420
That's why I don't remember it.

25:12.420 --> 25:14.100
Cause I knew it was poopy garbage.

25:15.940 --> 25:18.820
Could I pee like this forever?

25:20.180 --> 25:22.100
Could I pee like this forever?

25:22.740 --> 25:22.980
All right.

25:22.980 --> 25:25.060
Now let's, let's actually look at this.

25:25.060 --> 25:25.940
Let's think about it.

25:25.940 --> 25:30.420
We know that we know that if you drink water later, you will pee.

25:30.420 --> 25:31.220
Pee comes out of you.

25:31.940 --> 25:32.260
Right.

25:32.260 --> 25:37.140
I think the problem and, and I do, I mean, so that system is working.

25:37.140 --> 25:44.340
I think the problem would be that the lead on the pee that you would need would be so

25:45.220 --> 25:51.380
I don't think you'd be able to drink enough before the piece started to keep it going permanently.

25:52.740 --> 25:58.580
But I think that in this fiction that mobile has created, he's saying, or she's saying,

25:58.580 --> 26:05.860
what if it was just like a, I could keep drinking like quantity capacity was not an issue.

26:05.860 --> 26:08.180
Scientifically, how much do you displace?

26:08.180 --> 26:08.500
Right.

26:08.500 --> 26:11.140
Pints, pints per minute.

26:11.140 --> 26:15.140
Your pee, you gotta look at your PPM and then you measure that.

26:15.140 --> 26:19.300
And then you just displace that by drinking the same amount of water.

26:19.300 --> 26:21.540
And you're not going to be chugging.

26:21.540 --> 26:24.340
You know, the pee doesn't fall out of you that quickly.

26:26.020 --> 26:29.780
So I think as long as you displace it like that and you keep it going, you keep it float,

26:29.780 --> 26:33.220
keep it, just keep the stream rolling.

26:33.220 --> 26:37.220
Big wheel keep on turning, then you're going to be able to turn yourself into a beautiful fountain

26:37.220 --> 26:38.900
like in that hilarious gold member movie.

26:39.540 --> 26:43.220
But then the question is like, how much water turns into how much pee?

26:43.220 --> 26:45.380
Like, are you taking one to one, one to one?

26:45.380 --> 26:48.660
You add some yellow in there somewhere in your body, probably in the gallbladder.

26:49.220 --> 26:52.820
And then then then it's ready to go ready to ship that product out.

26:53.940 --> 26:55.700
Could this work?

26:55.700 --> 26:56.020
Yes.

26:56.580 --> 26:57.460
For another?

26:58.100 --> 26:59.300
Oh, Justin.

26:59.300 --> 27:02.980
And did you become a dirt machine?

27:05.300 --> 27:06.260
A dirt machine.

27:06.260 --> 27:07.460
You shouldn't have.

27:07.460 --> 27:08.820
You eat that food.

27:08.820 --> 27:12.980
You eat a taco, pizza, ramen noodle, dirt machine.

27:12.980 --> 27:17.380
You, I feel like are the most equipped to make this experiment happen with your baby.

27:17.380 --> 27:18.500
What is that supposed to mean?

27:18.500 --> 27:26.660
With your baby, because your baby, as a baby, the pipes there are so short, short pipes.

27:26.660 --> 27:30.980
We're that's probably like a that's probably like a 15 minute exchange all told.

27:32.260 --> 27:39.300
I think what I think what you're describing leads to a pretty chilly reception from the

27:39.300 --> 27:41.300
jury on my part.

27:41.300 --> 27:47.620
I think I think what you're describing is a fairly is a fairly cold shoulder from a

27:47.620 --> 27:48.500
jury of my peers.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.620
And in conclusion, science, science.

27:51.620 --> 27:55.860
In conclusion, I was trying to discover science.

27:55.860 --> 27:57.700
I'll take my children to jail.

27:57.700 --> 28:00.020
I asked, I will go to jail now.

28:00.020 --> 28:02.100
I asked myself, can I?

28:02.100 --> 28:04.020
But I never asked myself, should I?

28:04.020 --> 28:08.020
But if I had the answer still would have been yes, because it was pretty great.

28:08.020 --> 28:12.100
So now I'm slapping him on a lunchbox and I'm selling it.

28:12.100 --> 28:27.460
I am starving.

28:27.460 --> 28:33.620
We're recording this on a rare Saturday morning and my hunger is off the charts right now.

28:35.220 --> 28:39.540
Do you guys have any big like Saturday plans that that maybe you'll be snacking during?

28:39.540 --> 28:41.860
Uh, we got that.

28:41.860 --> 28:44.660
I gotta watch Marshall beat Rice.

28:44.660 --> 28:45.940
Go herd.

28:45.940 --> 28:46.660
Go herd.

28:46.660 --> 28:48.180
I've got a herd on.

28:48.180 --> 28:49.940
I've got a herd on too, Travis.

28:49.940 --> 28:54.980
I have thundering herd erectile dysfunction.

28:56.740 --> 28:58.180
I have a semi herd on.

28:59.540 --> 29:01.540
Have you guys ever noticed that sounds like a hard on?

29:01.540 --> 29:03.300
Oh my God, you're right.

29:03.300 --> 29:05.460
Guys, tell me about Nature Box.

29:05.460 --> 29:09.620
Nature Box is going to give you some free snacks.

29:09.620 --> 29:10.340
How does that sound?

29:11.140 --> 29:11.700
Here's the thing.

29:12.420 --> 29:17.540
There's delicious, wholesome snacks available at naturebox.com.

29:17.540 --> 29:18.820
It's like a subscription service.

29:19.540 --> 29:25.860
You tell them which of their snacks that you want to try and they will send you a box of them

29:27.140 --> 29:28.020
in the mail every month.

29:28.020 --> 29:30.900
Now, but before you like commit to that, cause that's a lot.

29:30.900 --> 29:32.100
That's a lot to commit to.

29:32.100 --> 29:38.580
They're going to send you a free trial sampler to enjoy all on your own.

29:38.580 --> 29:39.700
Can you imagine?

29:39.700 --> 29:44.100
I can because people are tweeting at us all the time with pictures of their free cocoa.

29:44.100 --> 29:46.660
I can because I'm eating Nature Box right now.

29:46.660 --> 29:47.220
Yeah.

29:47.220 --> 29:49.060
What are you, what are you, what are you notching?

29:49.060 --> 29:54.740
I've got some plantain chips, which I thought would be sweet and are actually savory and super

29:54.740 --> 29:55.140
good.

29:55.140 --> 29:58.740
Yeah, plantains are just a palette for spices to be painted on.

29:59.700 --> 30:01.140
I want to talk about clusters this week.

30:01.140 --> 30:01.460
Oh, shit.

30:01.460 --> 30:02.740
That's what I'm into this week.

30:02.740 --> 30:03.540
Like scientific?

30:03.540 --> 30:06.180
Black sesame seed, black sesame seed clusters.

30:06.980 --> 30:08.900
Those are limited edition through December.

30:08.900 --> 30:09.940
So you don't want to miss out on that.

30:09.940 --> 30:14.260
Blueberry almond bites, which I love, cashew power clusters.

30:14.900 --> 30:18.420
That's what the transformers were fighting over, if I remember correctly.

30:19.860 --> 30:22.580
We have to retrieve the cashew power clusters.

30:23.700 --> 30:29.860
If you want to get your free box and start dipping in, go to naturebox.com slash my brother

30:29.860 --> 30:32.900
and you're going to, it's not, it won't cost you money.

30:32.900 --> 30:35.380
It's a free trial box.

30:35.380 --> 30:38.420
And you're not going to get artificial flavors or colors or sweeteners.

30:39.060 --> 30:41.700
And there's no trans fats or high fructose corn syrup.

30:41.700 --> 30:43.940
You're just going to get fed and full and happy.

30:44.660 --> 30:45.700
From nature.

30:45.700 --> 30:47.060
From nature for once.

30:47.860 --> 30:53.940
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother and get a free trial box of delicious snacks.

30:53.940 --> 30:56.980
Isn't it time that nature gave something back to you?

30:56.980 --> 31:04.420
Now say I love my trial box and I decide immediately that I want to purchase $35,000

31:04.420 --> 31:05.620
worth of nature box snacks.

31:05.620 --> 31:05.940
Mm-hmm.

31:07.060 --> 31:09.140
Then you would be making a wise investment.

31:09.140 --> 31:11.380
I am, I am a hoarder.

31:11.380 --> 31:13.620
The doomsday is just around the corner.

31:13.620 --> 31:16.100
The polar vortex is killing us all.

31:16.100 --> 31:17.540
It's already started.

31:17.540 --> 31:21.300
Read the newspapers, by which I mean the underground newspapers.

31:21.300 --> 31:25.540
The only ones that are really telling the truth about this goddamn polar vortex that

31:25.540 --> 31:27.060
seems, oh, it's such an oddity.

31:27.060 --> 31:28.900
We never get these polar vortexes.

31:28.900 --> 31:32.340
Is that, cause it feels like we get them about every six months now.

31:32.340 --> 31:33.860
So just read the literature.

31:33.860 --> 31:34.420
You have a fucking point.

31:34.420 --> 31:36.180
What were we doing?

31:36.740 --> 31:40.340
$35, $35,000 worth of snacks from nature box.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.580
So face it.

31:42.580 --> 31:44.740
Oh, I need, I need $35,000.

31:44.740 --> 31:45.300
That's right.

31:46.580 --> 31:53.620
So maybe you need $35,000 to hoard or maybe you need $35,000 to fix your home.

31:53.620 --> 31:59.060
Or maybe you need some money to go back to school or maybe you need to get car repairs

31:59.060 --> 32:02.340
that you can't afford or dental work or medical bills.

32:02.340 --> 32:07.060
Well, there's a peer-to-peer lending service called prosper.com that you should check out.

32:07.060 --> 32:11.220
And basically how it works is instead of going to a bank and dealing with all of the bank

32:11.220 --> 32:16.660
interactions and working with people who do not care about you, that old bank smell that

32:16.660 --> 32:20.180
smells like money and greed and those pin chains.

32:20.180 --> 32:21.620
Smells like wet change.

32:21.620 --> 32:28.580
Oh, instead you just go to prosper.com and you put in what you need the loan for and

32:28.580 --> 32:29.460
how much you need.

32:29.460 --> 32:34.660
And then other users of the site decide if they want to invest in your loan or not.

32:35.300 --> 32:40.580
So that way, rather than one location giving you all of that money, it's several different

32:40.580 --> 32:40.980
people.

32:40.980 --> 32:45.860
It's many, many people all contributing into your loan and then you're paying them back.

32:45.860 --> 32:47.220
So it cuts off the middleman.

32:47.220 --> 32:48.740
I mean, that's what banks do anyways.

32:48.740 --> 32:52.660
If you put money into a bank, that money is what goes into other people's loans.

32:52.660 --> 32:54.100
So why not cut out the middleman?

32:54.660 --> 32:55.860
Maybe save a little money.

32:56.580 --> 33:00.020
Yeah, it's basically like the end of It's a Wonderful Life.

33:00.020 --> 33:02.020
Just you don't have to be a good person.

33:02.020 --> 33:02.420
Yeah.

33:02.420 --> 33:07.140
You could actually be, it's the end of It's a Wonderful Life, but even the bad guy from

33:07.140 --> 33:08.580
It's a Wonderful Life can get it.

33:10.340 --> 33:12.900
Nobody knows what kind of person you are on the internet.

33:12.900 --> 33:13.380
Bad.

33:13.380 --> 33:14.740
If you're on the internet, you're a bad person.

33:14.740 --> 33:18.660
If you want to go check your rate and see if you would qualify for a low rate, you can

33:18.660 --> 33:21.380
do so instantly without affecting your good credit.

33:21.380 --> 33:24.820
If you just go to prosper.com slash my brother and check your rate.

33:24.820 --> 33:29.780
And also right now, listeners of this show, if you get a loan through prosper.com, you'll

33:29.780 --> 33:34.740
automatically get a free $50 visa gift card that you can use in any way you want to.

33:34.740 --> 33:39.140
So on top of the loan you're getting, you're also just getting $50 that you'll never have

33:39.140 --> 33:39.620
to pay back.

33:39.620 --> 33:40.820
And that's just free money.

33:40.820 --> 33:46.180
And in America, that free money is better than, I don't know, seeing your principal

33:46.180 --> 33:47.140
buy beer.

33:47.140 --> 33:52.260
You can buy your principal two cubes of beast with that kind of scratch.

33:52.980 --> 33:53.700
At least.

33:54.340 --> 33:59.220
If you find it on sale, like a Black Friday beast sale, which I assume happens.

33:59.220 --> 33:59.700
Cool.

33:59.700 --> 34:01.700
Cool day after Thanksgiving plans.

34:01.700 --> 34:02.660
Other restrictions apply.

34:02.660 --> 34:04.820
See site for programming visa prepaid card details.

34:04.820 --> 34:06.260
All personal loans are made by what bank?

34:06.260 --> 34:09.700
Utah chartered industrial bank member, FDIC, equal opportunity lender.

34:09.700 --> 34:10.200
Booyah.

34:10.200 --> 34:17.160
Uh, I got a message for Blair and it's from, get this, a lice.

34:17.160 --> 34:19.160
I guess it's like a lice bug.

34:19.160 --> 34:20.440
Did you like that joke?

34:21.080 --> 34:24.040
Griffin, I'm the dad on the show.

34:24.040 --> 34:28.600
I wish we could just get a fucking focus group to do one of our episodes for us live and

34:28.600 --> 34:34.280
just tell us what jokes are amazing and which jokes are just pretty good.

34:34.280 --> 34:34.920
Like that one.

34:34.920 --> 34:40.280
Dear Blair, you deserve to hear how awesome you are from as many people as possible.

34:40.280 --> 34:44.040
So why not three count them three McElroy's?

34:44.040 --> 34:49.000
I am always impressed by your strength of character and your devotion to the people

34:49.000 --> 34:50.120
and things that you love.

34:50.120 --> 34:53.080
You're a total badass and should never, ever doubt it.

34:53.080 --> 34:54.440
I love you big sister.

34:55.160 --> 34:57.320
Don't ever stop being a beautiful.

34:57.320 --> 34:59.000
Oh, hold the goddamn shit.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.760
That's like the Twilight Twilight zoned.

35:02.760 --> 35:05.640
Yeah, you really flipped it on us there at the end.

35:05.640 --> 35:09.960
I got to say, Alice, this is a very sweet message that you've given to your big sister

35:09.960 --> 35:14.520
Blair, but it's going to fall on deaf ears, which is to say no ears cause she's a tree.

35:14.520 --> 35:16.360
She's a tree Shyamalan.

35:16.360 --> 35:17.480
Unless she's like an ent.

35:18.040 --> 35:19.080
Oh my God.

35:19.080 --> 35:24.440
What if she's a proto ent and you play the message for her and a little bit of sap comes

35:24.440 --> 35:26.680
out of where her eye holes would be.

35:26.680 --> 35:30.840
Chelsea Handler vehicle, my sister, the ent only lasted three episodes.

35:30.840 --> 35:32.840
And I think that is a crying shame.

35:32.840 --> 35:33.800
She deserved better.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.440
Carla got a message for you coming from Dan.

35:39.560 --> 35:41.720
What does Dan have to say, Trev?

35:41.720 --> 35:44.600
Dan says the past three years have been the best of my life.

35:44.600 --> 35:48.680
Even during the parts with all the problems, you made me want to be a better me and gave

35:48.680 --> 35:51.000
me a whole new appreciation for finding Nemo.

35:51.000 --> 35:51.640
I love you.

35:51.640 --> 35:56.280
And I look forward to many years of mutual love and one true football too many years

35:56.280 --> 35:58.600
of mutual love of the one true football.

35:58.600 --> 35:59.400
I made it better.

35:59.400 --> 36:00.360
I don't think you did.

36:00.360 --> 36:03.000
I think he broke it with my, with my accidental words.

36:04.600 --> 36:06.280
These are like both really nice.

36:06.280 --> 36:09.160
It is, but I'm so now unaccustomed.

36:09.160 --> 36:11.960
I'm so much more used to hit me up on my mobile.

36:11.960 --> 36:14.120
Yeah, which is fine, which is great.

36:14.120 --> 36:14.600
It's fine.

36:15.480 --> 36:19.160
I, but again, this one has like a twist mystery at the end of twistery, doesn't it?

36:19.160 --> 36:19.960
They're at the end.

36:19.960 --> 36:24.920
Cause it's Dan, a football football.

36:25.720 --> 36:28.280
I don't think they have a pet football.

36:28.280 --> 36:30.680
Maybe the two of them together love a football.

36:30.680 --> 36:34.920
Maybe they're both footballs in which case, who sent this message in?

36:34.920 --> 36:37.400
It's a twister, it's a twistery.

36:37.400 --> 36:39.800
Griffin, really, if you think about it, aren't we all footballs?

36:39.800 --> 36:41.240
Ooh, wait, let me check.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.600
Wait, I don't have arms and legs.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.040
I'm all leathery and laced up.

36:44.040 --> 36:45.720
It's a twistery.

36:45.720 --> 36:49.240
What if God was a football?

36:49.240 --> 36:53.160
Delicious, delicious twistery.

36:53.160 --> 36:56.040
We can only see out our eyes.

36:56.040 --> 36:58.600
We can't look down at our hands.

36:58.600 --> 37:03.400
So we could have been footballs all the time.

37:03.400 --> 37:05.960
Oh, but Bruce Willis is the only non football.

37:05.960 --> 37:07.240
Oh my God.

37:07.240 --> 37:10.040
And if you really look back over the movie, the clues were all there.

37:10.040 --> 37:11.800
Cause he's not made of leather.

37:11.800 --> 37:13.880
Cause all the characters were footballs.

37:13.880 --> 37:18.440
Haley Joel Osment actually kind of looks like a football now.

37:18.440 --> 37:20.760
I don't know if you've seen him lately.

37:20.760 --> 37:21.240
Come on.

37:21.240 --> 37:23.000
He's a, I love, it's a good look.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.160
I think a football is the most handsome of all the balls.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.160
He's like a living Hey Arnold.

37:27.160 --> 37:27.800
That's what it looks like.

37:27.800 --> 37:28.280
No.

37:28.280 --> 37:29.160
Hey.

37:29.160 --> 37:31.240
I meant like vertically oriented.

37:31.240 --> 37:33.000
I'm never going to get him on the show now.

37:33.000 --> 37:33.400
Damn it.

37:35.480 --> 37:37.320
Hey, feeling lonely?

37:37.320 --> 37:38.840
My name's Jesse Thorn.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.840
My name's Jordan Morris.

37:40.840 --> 37:46.840
Do you want to listen to a program where two good friends get intimate with amazing guests

37:46.840 --> 37:52.840
like Maria Bamford, Rob Corddry, and other comedy superstars?

37:52.840 --> 37:55.880
Jordan Jesse Coe is here for you every week.

37:55.880 --> 37:59.560
We'll spill our guts for you and then make some jokes.

37:59.560 --> 38:03.320
Jordan Jesse Coe free at maximum fun.org.

38:04.840 --> 38:09.000
My boyfriend and I have been together for 25 years and live 2.5 years.

38:09.000 --> 38:09.800
Holy shit.

38:10.680 --> 38:12.840
My Travis read it.

38:12.840 --> 38:13.240
I'm done.

38:13.240 --> 38:13.720
I'm at the game.

38:13.720 --> 38:18.200
My boyfriend and I have been together for 2.5 years and living together for the last year.

38:18.200 --> 38:18.600
Lately.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.200
I feel like we have grown apart.

38:20.200 --> 38:22.600
What is the least shitty way to break up with someone?

38:22.600 --> 38:23.080
God, it's tough.

38:23.080 --> 38:25.400
And that's from It's Not Me, It's Utah.

38:25.400 --> 38:27.960
That's an amazing choice for our comedy show.

38:27.960 --> 38:31.800
Pretty great Saturday morning cartoon here for us.

38:31.800 --> 38:36.040
Listen, it's a topic we haven't covered and I feel like there's a lot of help to give here.

38:36.600 --> 38:39.080
You know what the least shitty way is?

38:39.080 --> 38:41.960
The least shitty way for the other person.

38:41.960 --> 38:47.240
Not for you because that's what's fucked up is it is an inverse relationship.

38:47.240 --> 38:50.520
The more shitty it is for you, the less shitty it is for them.

38:50.520 --> 38:54.120
And so if you want to actually do this and you want to do it right,

38:54.120 --> 38:56.760
it's going to be fucking miserable for you.

38:56.760 --> 38:58.440
You have to fake your own death.

38:58.440 --> 39:01.720
No, that's no, that's the least shitty way for you.

39:02.840 --> 39:04.680
I think that's pretty good.

39:04.680 --> 39:10.440
No, I mean, the least shitty way for the other person is direct and like honest and just say,

39:10.440 --> 39:14.360
like, hey, I don't think, you know, it's changed and I don't feel the same way.

39:14.360 --> 39:18.600
And then you have to just like sit there and take whatever they fucking take it.

39:18.600 --> 39:27.560
It open your jaw and swallow, swallow all the anger or sadness or pain in their eyes or whatever.

39:27.560 --> 39:31.480
And then you also, if you're the instigator, you've got to deal with a lot more fallout

39:31.480 --> 39:35.000
from like your friends and neighbors and all of those people that, you know,

39:35.000 --> 39:37.320
in town that have gotten to know you guys as a couple.

39:37.320 --> 39:39.720
And you share a lot of stuff because you live together.

39:39.720 --> 39:41.080
And I'm not telling you not to do it.

39:41.080 --> 39:44.520
I'm just saying as the instigator, it's usually a lot more.

39:44.520 --> 39:54.440
Sucks ass. I, the thing that I think I learned during like my dating career was that like,

39:54.440 --> 40:00.280
don't, don't, don't check out so much before you break up with the person that all you can

40:00.280 --> 40:04.440
think about is how fucking sweet it's going to be after you don't have this horrible thing

40:04.440 --> 40:05.720
in front of you anymore.

40:05.720 --> 40:09.880
If you don't treat this thing with the respect that like the length of your relationship,

40:09.880 --> 40:15.080
like the, the amount of credit that that has earned with you, like if you, if you don't keep

40:15.080 --> 40:21.080
in mind like how much time and energy the, both of you have put into this thing while

40:21.080 --> 40:25.640
considering your options for how to break up with the person, you are doing both of you

40:25.640 --> 40:27.800
a fucking enormous disservice.

40:28.600 --> 40:32.360
The grown apart is like the worst way of breaking up.

40:32.360 --> 40:37.400
Like that's the, cause they may come out an absolute clear blue sky for the other person,

40:37.400 --> 40:39.960
like no clue.

40:39.960 --> 40:45.720
Or I would say the other, other side of that coin is if you hesitate and you like if right

40:45.720 --> 40:50.200
now this second, you know, it's not working and you are mentally ready to break up with

40:50.200 --> 40:54.520
them and then you put it off for like a couple of weeks because you're not ready to actually

40:54.520 --> 41:00.280
do it yet and then your behavior changes, your attitude towards them change and it just

41:00.280 --> 41:02.200
is hell for the next four weeks.

41:02.200 --> 41:05.720
Trav, could you use that time to start seeding it though?

41:05.720 --> 41:11.160
So it's not such a complete, like could you start saying things like, ah, I could use

41:11.160 --> 41:12.680
some more space.

41:12.680 --> 41:16.120
Or like, do you want to rent the Jennifer Aniston movie The Breakup again?

41:16.120 --> 41:23.560
No, guys, cause, cause that's just, that's just a way of making, of, of spreading the

41:23.560 --> 41:25.720
worstness out, you know what I mean?

41:25.720 --> 41:31.560
It's not going to be less shitty for this person to get dumped if they just do it all

41:31.560 --> 41:36.760
at once, it's going to be, it's going to be more, way more shitty for them to see it coming,

41:36.760 --> 41:42.040
to have this like nice thing, like sort of go sour and then ultimately when it ends,

41:42.040 --> 41:43.800
like it's going to hurt just as much anyway.

41:43.800 --> 41:52.280
Have, have you guys, here's a question for you, have you been dumped or dumped more?

41:52.280 --> 41:53.560
What has happened to you more?

41:53.560 --> 41:55.560
Have you been the dumper or the dumpee more?

41:55.560 --> 41:57.000
I have been dumped more.

41:58.120 --> 41:58.680
Okay.

41:58.680 --> 41:59.160
Griffin?

41:59.160 --> 42:04.280
Uh, Justin, this is a fucking trap because I, it's going to make me sound like a douche

42:04.280 --> 42:07.800
because I've dumped, I've definitely dumped, dumped Ed more.

42:07.800 --> 42:09.320
I, I got really bad.

42:09.320 --> 42:14.440
We have a great, we have a great representation here because I'm right, right in the middle.

42:14.440 --> 42:15.560
He split the uprights.

42:15.560 --> 42:16.840
One, one and one.

42:17.880 --> 42:18.760
I, one and one.

42:18.760 --> 42:25.880
I got to, my problem was a, especially like in college that I would usually, if I was

42:25.880 --> 42:30.440
not, no longer interested in continuing the relationship, would just kind of act like

42:30.440 --> 42:33.080
a jerk until it ended so that I wouldn't have to do it.

42:34.200 --> 42:34.520
You know what I mean?

42:34.520 --> 42:38.360
I don't need to, uh, amend.

42:38.920 --> 42:47.400
I have dumped more and the one extra that I had forgotten about, sorry, madam, uh, uh,

42:47.400 --> 42:49.720
I told I was moving soon.

42:50.520 --> 42:52.280
I was moving soon.

42:52.280 --> 42:57.480
And I couldn't pursue a relationship because I was moving so that's weird because I feel

42:57.480 --> 42:59.560
like you've lived in Huntington basically your whole life.

42:59.560 --> 43:03.160
I didn't end up going through with the move.

43:03.160 --> 43:03.480
Okay.

43:03.480 --> 43:07.640
Wait, no, at the time, were you honestly planning to move and change your mind?

43:08.120 --> 43:08.840
I was young.

43:08.840 --> 43:12.680
I had a lot of options in front of me, so I mean, hell, I don't know.

43:12.680 --> 43:14.120
It's a big wide world out there.

43:14.120 --> 43:16.520
It was potential energy that brought that.

43:16.520 --> 43:17.000
Right.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.880
Um, no, it's, I, I, here's the thing.

43:19.880 --> 43:21.880
Here's the thing I feel.

43:22.920 --> 43:23.960
Oh God.

43:23.960 --> 43:27.800
Whenever I got dumped, it was always sudden out of the clear blue sky.

43:28.440 --> 43:32.600
And whenever I dumped, it was, I would always just let it fucking fester like this.

43:32.600 --> 43:35.080
And that's why I got to feel like you can't do it.

43:35.080 --> 43:36.600
It's like an infected limb.

43:37.160 --> 43:37.480
Yeah.

43:37.480 --> 43:39.880
It's, it's, it's, it's really, really horrible.

43:39.880 --> 43:48.920
I think also, can we just agree as a fucking nation as a world ground rules, nothing with

43:48.920 --> 43:54.280
written words, no emails, no God damn texts, no AI Ms.

43:54.280 --> 43:56.840
Nobody wants to, we're done.

43:57.560 --> 43:59.240
That's the sound of the instant message.

43:59.240 --> 44:03.720
And, and as comforting as you feel like or protective, don't like go out to a restaurant

44:03.720 --> 44:05.320
and dump somebody in a restaurant.

44:05.960 --> 44:06.840
Like do it.

44:06.840 --> 44:10.840
Unless you like, I don't know, unless you need a safe space to do it.

44:10.840 --> 44:11.640
Well, that's true.

44:11.640 --> 44:15.240
It's just like, uh, is there a place you could do it?

44:15.240 --> 44:15.640
Okay.

44:15.640 --> 44:15.880
Okay.

44:15.880 --> 44:16.120
Okay.

44:16.120 --> 44:16.280
Okay.

44:16.280 --> 44:17.080
Okay.

44:17.080 --> 44:21.720
Is there a place that you could dump someone, a place or a time or whatever?

44:21.720 --> 44:26.120
Is there a place where you could dump someone where they might be able to, because of the

44:26.120 --> 44:33.720
place they are in could like convert it to where they can almost instantly get over it?

44:33.720 --> 44:35.160
Dave and Buster's.

44:35.160 --> 44:37.320
That's what Dave and Buster's is for.

44:37.320 --> 44:38.440
Oh man, that sucks.

44:38.440 --> 44:44.440
Let me get an onion ring tower and oh my God, you guys have a, a fisherman's bait here.

44:44.440 --> 44:45.240
This is going to be great.

44:45.240 --> 44:48.600
I'm going to go, I'm going to eat this onion ring tower and then I'm going to go play

44:48.600 --> 44:51.000
that a deep sea shooter game that Sega made.

44:51.000 --> 44:55.000
Griffin, you write about video games for a living and it took you 10 seconds to pull

44:55.000 --> 44:55.960
an arcade game.

44:55.960 --> 44:56.600
I'm so disappointed.

44:56.600 --> 44:58.520
And your pole was fisherman's bait.

44:58.520 --> 44:59.720
Oh, I'm so frustrated.

44:59.720 --> 45:02.760
I'm going to go play Silent Scope and then they go play Silent Scope and then they're

45:02.760 --> 45:03.080
fine.

45:03.080 --> 45:05.640
And they won enough tickets to get a new girlfriend.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.000
That is not how that works.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.120
Oh God.

45:12.120 --> 45:14.120
Is a phone, can we establish it?

45:14.120 --> 45:21.240
As long as we're fucking writing up the articles of confederation here is, is a phone call.

45:21.240 --> 45:21.960
Okay.

45:21.960 --> 45:28.280
Within two months, if you've only been dating two months, but two and a half years and you're

45:28.280 --> 45:30.680
living together, that's not a phone call.

45:32.040 --> 45:33.560
I recused myself from the question.

45:33.560 --> 45:34.360
Okay.

45:34.360 --> 45:34.600
Yeah.

45:35.160 --> 45:42.600
Oh, that was kind of my jam, but it was also my jam because it was like situations like

45:42.600 --> 45:47.320
this where it was, where it was like, oh, we've grown very, very far apart and we both

45:47.320 --> 45:48.680
kind of know this thing is coming.

45:48.680 --> 45:54.200
That's the other thing, like that is another dynamic entirely of if both of you think this

45:54.200 --> 45:59.960
thing is about to like come crashing down, then it's almost like a relief to end it.

45:59.960 --> 46:00.520
You know what I mean?

46:00.520 --> 46:03.640
Cause we don't know how, we don't know how your boyfriend feels.

46:04.200 --> 46:09.640
If your boyfriend is like in the same boat as you, then maybe the breakup won't be as

46:09.640 --> 46:14.280
like, I mean, it'll be very, very sad, but maybe it won't be as like hyper painful.

46:14.280 --> 46:16.680
Maybe it'll be a relief to some degree.

46:16.680 --> 46:16.920
Right.

46:16.920 --> 46:22.040
I think, I think when a bad relationship ends that both people are unhappy with when that

46:22.040 --> 46:24.840
ends, that is a good thing for everybody involved.

46:26.600 --> 46:32.840
And, and it will suck for, I mean, no matter what, like even if you have grown apart, but

46:32.840 --> 46:34.120
like that's the nature of it.

46:34.120 --> 46:35.480
That's the nature of the beast.

46:35.480 --> 46:36.840
So just do it.

46:36.840 --> 46:42.440
Make, can I make a recommendation though, please, please try to have your shit boxed

46:42.440 --> 46:47.480
up, please try to be a little bit prepared for what's going to happen next because one

46:47.480 --> 46:51.000
of you is going to have to a carry that lease by yourself.

46:51.000 --> 46:54.360
You're going to pay the rent by yourself and the other one's going to have to move.

46:54.360 --> 46:56.360
Like please have an eggs fill.

46:57.800 --> 47:01.480
I've had friends that have been living with people and broken up like three months into

47:01.480 --> 47:08.840
a year long lease and then have continued like living under the same roof, but as exes

47:08.840 --> 47:11.480
because neither one could screw the other.

47:11.480 --> 47:14.520
It's just sounds like the most purgatorial shit.

47:15.400 --> 47:22.600
Could you like, could that be, could you like use that to transition into like being okay

47:22.600 --> 47:23.080
with it?

47:23.080 --> 47:24.440
Could you use that for closure?

47:24.440 --> 47:25.240
Is that possible?

47:25.240 --> 47:27.560
Has anyone ever successfully done that?

47:27.560 --> 47:28.520
Nobody ever.

47:28.520 --> 47:32.520
No, because the problem is like even if it's like a two bedroom house and you're living

47:32.520 --> 47:34.360
in separate rooms, like what are you supposed to do?

47:34.360 --> 47:35.240
Start dating again?

47:35.800 --> 47:39.800
Like, or then you're still just hanging out all the time.

47:39.800 --> 47:41.000
I guess it worked on new girl.

47:42.440 --> 47:45.160
Spoilers, you guys want to Yahoo?

47:46.280 --> 47:46.440
Yeah.

47:50.600 --> 47:52.680
This Yahoo was sent in by level 44.

47:53.880 --> 47:56.520
Yahoo shaman drew Davenport.

47:56.520 --> 47:57.240
Thank you, Drew.

47:57.240 --> 47:59.080
It's by Yahoo, Drew answers users.

47:59.080 --> 48:08.360
Christian, a member since July 22nd, 2013, an aged veteran who asks, reaching for a dollar?

48:10.120 --> 48:13.000
Someone bent down to pick up a dollar outside the pharmacy.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.360
She almost had it when I stopped on it and picked it up.

48:16.920 --> 48:19.320
I scared her badly and I feel bad.

48:19.320 --> 48:23.000
I apologize for scaring her, but she still looks confused.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.520
Should I have apologized more?

48:24.520 --> 48:28.440
Or so this is just as hard as the last question.

48:28.440 --> 48:32.520
I feel like, okay, wait, break it down for me again.

48:33.320 --> 48:33.880
Okay.

48:33.880 --> 48:37.160
Someone been down and pick up a dollar outside of the pharmacy.

48:37.160 --> 48:42.280
Oh, she almost had it, but then this person stomped on it and picked it up.

48:42.280 --> 48:43.320
That is okay.

48:44.120 --> 48:46.440
Again, game recognize game.

48:46.440 --> 48:51.800
That is good dollar pickup strategy because if someone's getting the old fishing line,

48:51.800 --> 48:52.840
you're not going anywhere.

48:52.840 --> 48:56.440
You fucking Washington get you.

48:56.440 --> 49:00.120
Do you think that this question asked her like watched and watches like, oh, she's almost

49:00.120 --> 49:00.600
got it.

49:00.600 --> 49:01.000
Okay.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.760
And then left 45 feet into the air.

49:04.760 --> 49:05.320
Not today.

49:05.320 --> 49:10.280
Grandma went super saying and then butt stomped right down on this dollar bill.

49:10.920 --> 49:14.680
You were probably thinking about using that dollar bill to buy your, your grandson some

49:14.680 --> 49:17.080
candy for pills.

49:20.120 --> 49:20.280
Okay.

49:20.280 --> 49:22.440
If you guys see a dollar on the ground, you've been to pick it up, right?

49:22.440 --> 49:22.840
No.

49:22.840 --> 49:26.440
And what, what, what denomination, what, how, what denomination?

49:26.440 --> 49:27.000
I'm sorry.

49:27.000 --> 49:27.800
I said a dollar.

49:27.800 --> 49:30.040
So a dollar won a single dollar bill.

49:30.040 --> 49:32.280
Are you fucking kidding me with my back?

49:33.880 --> 49:36.120
That's why I keep, I keep my grabber arm with me.

49:37.000 --> 49:42.280
If you see a 50 outside of a business, do you take it into the business to say like,

49:42.280 --> 49:43.480
Hey, I found this outside.

49:43.480 --> 49:48.360
So if, in case someone comes looking for it, just like the, the legendary drakul, it all

49:48.360 --> 49:50.200
depends on the threshold.

49:50.200 --> 49:52.760
If it is outside, it is fair game.

49:52.760 --> 49:53.240
Yeah.

49:53.240 --> 49:56.520
If it's inside, it's fair game for a 50.

49:56.520 --> 49:59.640
I would fight everybody around me in a 100 foot radius.

49:59.640 --> 50:02.600
Like, and I was in fucking battle Royale.

50:02.600 --> 50:04.760
I would fight everyone for that shit.

50:04.760 --> 50:09.720
It would be like the opening scene in on Bach, just like me fucking climbing a tree to get

50:09.720 --> 50:12.520
to the $50 bill on top, just like kicking dudes to the ground.

50:13.160 --> 50:14.200
No way.

50:14.200 --> 50:16.280
$50 bill, 10 more dollars.

50:16.280 --> 50:18.200
I can buy a new AAA video game.

50:18.200 --> 50:19.800
Fuck off.

50:22.520 --> 50:24.120
But see, that's the thing though.

50:24.120 --> 50:27.960
I don't bend over for a single, but if I did 50 times.

50:31.000 --> 50:35.240
The reason I wanted us to address this question is because I feel like it, it, it, it tackles

50:35.240 --> 50:41.240
a lot of really tough subjects like embarrassing yourself by taking, bending over to pick up

50:41.240 --> 50:42.040
garbage off the ground.

50:42.040 --> 50:42.760
Cause that's what it is.

50:44.600 --> 50:45.800
Thievery potentially.

50:45.800 --> 50:47.320
Cause that might be somebody else's dollar.

50:47.320 --> 50:50.200
It might be this person's dollar that they literally just dropped.

50:50.200 --> 50:54.680
And you were standing behind this person, tailing them, waiting for them to drop currency.

50:54.680 --> 50:56.840
And then when they did, you swooped it.

50:56.840 --> 51:01.880
I think my favorite part of this question is the question askers like confusion at the

51:01.880 --> 51:03.800
other person's confusion.

51:03.800 --> 51:05.320
Like why would they be confused?

51:05.320 --> 51:07.560
Well, because like you waited until they almost had it.

51:07.560 --> 51:09.320
And then you stomped your foot down on it.

51:09.320 --> 51:13.720
You followed this person for seven blocks and they were like, whoops.

51:13.720 --> 51:15.320
And you were like mine.

51:15.320 --> 51:20.920
And then they were admittedly confused and they were confused because they had never

51:20.920 --> 51:23.640
seen a fucking bridge troll in their life before.

51:25.640 --> 51:28.440
I, uh, you guys throw pennies on the ground.

51:28.440 --> 51:29.000
Oh God.

51:29.000 --> 51:29.560
Yeah.

51:29.560 --> 51:36.840
When we were in Japan, we, uh, I racked up a lot of one yen coins and I don't know if

51:36.840 --> 51:42.840
you guys know how the, how the yen works, but it's basically 100 of those equals $1.

51:42.840 --> 51:48.840
So one yen, the coins are like made out of like play school, like plastic.

51:48.840 --> 51:50.440
They're the shittiest, worst coins.

51:50.440 --> 51:53.720
And I racked up like 700 of them while we were there.

51:53.720 --> 52:00.040
And I literally, the day we left, I put them all in a can and I threw the can away, threw

52:00.040 --> 52:04.360
it right in the garbage because like nobody takes them.

52:04.360 --> 52:05.400
Nobody wants those.

52:05.400 --> 52:12.520
I had a friend that I learned in middle school, actually, uh, who, who hated pennies and he

52:12.520 --> 52:14.920
would throw them like on the ground.

52:14.920 --> 52:18.920
If he got a penny, he would just like chuck it and, and, and lose it.

52:18.920 --> 52:20.440
He lived with his grandparents.

52:20.440 --> 52:28.200
And one day we were almost out of middle school, his grandfather presents this jar where he

52:28.200 --> 52:31.480
had been picking up these pennies and like collecting them.

52:31.480 --> 52:36.680
And he had like a sizable chunk of change and he was basically taunting my friend, Mark,

52:36.680 --> 52:40.120
because he had collected these riches off of him.

52:40.120 --> 52:45.240
He had like scrimped and saved and then had like a good 650 in a jar.

52:45.240 --> 52:52.280
Hold on, hold on, hold on, his $6 and 50 cents or $650, $6 and 50 cents.

52:52.280 --> 52:54.760
But keep in mind, of course, this was the eighties.

52:54.760 --> 53:01.240
Okay, but that could still, that could still, that could still, that could still, that could

53:01.240 --> 53:06.760
pull out to 650 zero, $6,500.

53:06.760 --> 53:10.040
And I still think all the work that went into picking up those pennies probably wasn't

53:10.040 --> 53:11.040
worth it.

53:11.040 --> 53:13.760
Peepers, Peepers, your back is so shitty.

53:13.760 --> 53:17.360
How did your back get so wildly shitty, Peepers?

53:17.360 --> 53:19.480
I just picked up $6 and 50 cents.

53:19.480 --> 53:21.560
That'll pay for my back surgery, won't it?

53:21.560 --> 53:22.920
No, it won't.

53:22.920 --> 53:27.480
Try adding another $14,994 to that.

53:27.480 --> 53:30.220
And then we can probably talk about back surgery.

53:30.220 --> 53:33.400
You fool.

53:33.400 --> 53:36.640
I can't believe we won the great war.

53:36.640 --> 53:37.640
With you.

53:37.640 --> 53:40.640
With you and your ilk.

53:40.640 --> 53:43.320
Thanks everybody so much for listening to our program.

53:43.320 --> 53:46.560
We hope you've had a lot of fun.

53:46.560 --> 53:55.760
Want to let you know we're going to be doing a live, a live broadcast of our, of our program.

53:55.760 --> 53:58.200
My brother, my brother and me.

53:58.200 --> 53:59.200
Home for the candle nights.

53:59.200 --> 54:00.200
A holiday spectacular.

54:00.200 --> 54:01.920
We're going to be in Huntington, West Virginia.

54:01.920 --> 54:08.520
We have sold 430 tickets, believe it or not.

54:08.520 --> 54:11.200
And we want you to be there.

54:11.200 --> 54:15.600
Travis, you made a bit.ly link, but I can't seem to scrounge it up.

54:15.600 --> 54:17.320
Do you remember what it was?

54:17.320 --> 54:20.600
It is bit.ly forward slash candle nights live.

54:20.600 --> 54:21.600
Okay.

54:21.600 --> 54:23.820
Bit.ly forward slash candle nights live.

54:23.820 --> 54:27.760
And you're going to be able to, uh, to go see that show.

54:27.760 --> 54:29.960
Now maybe you're thinking, Hey, I don't live near West Virginia.

54:29.960 --> 54:31.080
I can't do that.

54:31.080 --> 54:34.360
Let me tell you some of the places where we have sold tickets.

54:34.360 --> 54:41.200
We've sold 12 in Tennessee, 23 in Virginia, 38 in Pennsylvania, 15 from North Carolina,

54:41.200 --> 54:48.800
15 from Maryland, 44 from Kentucky, 18 from Illinois, eight from Georgia, two from Florida,

54:48.800 --> 54:55.400
three from Connecticut, two from Colorado and two from Switzerland.

54:55.400 --> 54:57.920
So I think that probably you can come.

54:57.920 --> 55:02.640
No pressure, but if we don't fucking all three of us turn into mirror balls on the stage

55:02.640 --> 55:07.560
and shoot light out of every pore from our body and hover around 15 feet in the air and

55:07.560 --> 55:13.360
give everybody $5,000, then I don't think that this show is going to be as good as these

55:13.360 --> 55:15.800
Swiss people think it's going to be.

55:15.800 --> 55:20.280
Oh boy, we'll do our best.

55:20.280 --> 55:23.160
If it makes you feel any better after the show, we'll probably get drunk with everyone

55:23.160 --> 55:26.560
and just get like blitzed.

55:26.560 --> 55:30.240
So that might be fun.

55:30.240 --> 55:34.480
So go see that, bit.ly forward slash Candle Nights Live.

55:34.480 --> 55:41.080
I don't know what we're going to do that would live up to how far people are coming, but

55:41.080 --> 55:43.200
it will be popping off.

55:43.200 --> 55:44.760
Yeah, we'll do our best.

55:44.760 --> 55:47.880
We want to hang out afterwards and all that good stuff.

55:47.880 --> 55:55.440
And Sawbones also will be opening, so fans of that program should come too.

55:55.440 --> 55:59.840

Speaking of YouTube, we just put up a new animated short from Tyler Crowley and it's

56:54.760 --> 56:55.760
so good.

56:55.760 --> 57:00.040
It's the shitty Iron Man bit, which is like, I don't know about you guys, but that's one

57:00.040 --> 57:02.760
of the funniest things that Griffin has done on the show.

57:02.760 --> 57:03.760
I love his rants.

57:03.760 --> 57:06.480

That cartoon, by the way, has three thousand, two hundred nine six, which is about a million

57:33.340 --> 57:34.340
two for you.

57:34.340 --> 57:36.960
Let's get Robert Downey Jr. to tweet that and then we're done.

57:36.960 --> 57:37.960
We can retire.

57:37.960 --> 57:40.200
Oh, and check out all the other shows on Max Fonda.

57:40.200 --> 57:41.200
They're incredible.

57:41.200 --> 57:42.200
That goes without saying.

57:42.200 --> 57:43.200
But I assume you're what's our featured show?

57:43.200 --> 57:48.080
Let's say this week's feature show is throwing shade, throwing shade.

57:48.080 --> 57:51.480
A man and a woman.

57:51.480 --> 57:52.560
I'm not sure if they're a couple.

57:52.560 --> 57:55.560
I think they might be a couple.

57:55.560 --> 58:00.480
They talk about women's issues and gay issues.

58:00.480 --> 58:01.920
I'm not sure what gives them the right.

58:01.920 --> 58:03.400
But sure.

58:03.400 --> 58:05.760
And throwing shade is actually really, really, really funny.

58:05.760 --> 58:06.760
It's super good.

58:06.760 --> 58:08.880
If you like this show, you'll like throwing shade.

58:08.880 --> 58:11.160
I know they might be giants or a fan of throwing shade.

58:11.160 --> 58:14.580
So hey, that's that's enough for me.

58:14.580 --> 58:15.880
I think that's going to do it.

58:15.880 --> 58:16.880
Final yahoo.
