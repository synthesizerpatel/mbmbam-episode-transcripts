00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:45.920 --> 00:53.520
in the air, and love smells like the windscreen on a microphone, though that may just be the

00:53.520 --> 01:01.520
windscreen on my microphone. Hi, I'm Justin McElroy, the co-brother, co-host, and co-provocateur of

01:01.520 --> 01:06.800
My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm Travis McElroy, and I am

01:06.800 --> 01:18.480
a co-host and co-privateer as well. Oh, Griffin! Griffin, what's wrong?

01:20.240 --> 01:26.720
I mean, nothing, I guess. No, now come on, don't keep it inside. A feeling locked inside

01:26.720 --> 01:32.640
is poison for your mind. That's what I always say. Hey, I just, I did want to note before you

01:32.640 --> 01:37.680
talk about your crushing loneliness, we had to record this intro twice, and I did the same

01:37.680 --> 01:42.640
windscreen bit before, and I thought it was so good that I decided to stick with it. It wasn't

01:42.640 --> 01:46.480
like a thing of the moment that I came up with. That's like the second time I decided that would

01:46.480 --> 01:53.760
be good enough. You actually even giggled at it this time. It ramped up. It really got to me. It

01:53.760 --> 02:02.160
really got jumped up in there. Griffin, Valentine's Day was created by a greeting card. Think about

02:02.160 --> 02:13.280
it. I am thinking about it. Here's my stance on it. Jewish people... Good start. They don't get

02:13.280 --> 02:19.200
sad around Christmas, right? Right. Well, A, because they're so occupied with candle nights,

02:19.200 --> 02:29.760
but B, ain't got no dog in that race. Yeah, no dog in that particular race. I get it. You know

02:29.760 --> 02:36.400
what, Griffin? You're lonely all the time. You shouldn't let the corporations make you feel

02:36.400 --> 02:44.640
lonelier today. You know what? Here's my motto. I'm bringing lonely back. Some of the best poetry,

02:44.640 --> 02:48.640
some of the best songs have been written in a state of loneliness. Some of our best podcasts

02:48.640 --> 02:56.960
have been recorded while Griffin was single. It's true. Namely, 100% of them. And possibly

02:56.960 --> 03:02.080
throughout the fullness of time. No, no, no. You'll find that special somebody. Maybe we'll

03:02.080 --> 03:08.800
find somebody in here, in this mix. Between the three of us? Fuck, I hope not. No, I don't think

03:08.800 --> 03:17.120
so. And now our special guest, Vanessa Hudgens. Okay, here we go. Valentine's Day is coming up,

03:17.120 --> 03:22.960
and I'm wondering if you guys have any ideas of what I can get my lady, Lily, as a gift.

03:22.960 --> 03:27.280
I have a limited budget since we were both in college in this dirt poor, but I want to make

03:27.280 --> 03:33.040
it kind of special too. Thoughts? David from Gmail. You know, there's so many things that

03:33.040 --> 03:40.880
you can do that costs little to no money, but show a great deal of thought. But what really matters

03:40.880 --> 03:47.760
is money is how much money you spend on it. No, if Lily's cool with, you know, a coupon for one free

03:47.760 --> 03:54.400
back rub, then... Or a groupon for one free back rub. 200 people bought in, and now we get free

03:54.400 --> 04:03.200
back rubs. Really tired hands. So you think back rubs are the way to go? I mean, it's an oldie,

04:03.200 --> 04:08.560
but a goodie. Yeah, I mean, that's a classic. Griffin, what do you think? Cheap Valentine's

04:08.560 --> 04:20.000
Day gifts? Like a shitty necklace? I don't know. Hey, I got creative this year, and I got you bad

04:20.000 --> 04:26.080
things. It's not only that, I just want everybody to know that... I don't know. I don't usually give

04:26.080 --> 04:34.080
great advice, but on this particular episode, I'm not on my fucking A game. Get her a DVD, I guess.

04:34.080 --> 04:42.480
With love in it. Like Love Actually? Or For Love of Money. That's a good flick. Can't watch it too

04:42.480 --> 04:48.880
much nowadays without getting hurt, but like, it's a good movie. Just a DVD, or a Blu-ray if

04:48.880 --> 04:53.760
you really love her, but I know that you're straight out of low cash, so gotta make do.

04:53.760 --> 04:59.520
Hey David, I know it might seem like a great idea to loudly announce that for Valentine's Day,

04:59.520 --> 05:06.800
you're giving her a world class fucking... It's not gonna have... Top of the line! It's not gonna

05:06.800 --> 05:11.920
read the way. I'm giving you my best moves tonight. Tonight, I'll be supplying you with some of my

05:11.920 --> 05:18.320
grade A moves. Maybe just put like a bow on your wiener, and yell, you're welcome. You're welcome.

05:18.320 --> 05:23.520
It's the gift that keeps on giving. Accept it like it gives once. For 15 minutes, and then

05:23.520 --> 05:27.760
he gets a little bit. And a power bar. Then your feet are touching me, they're so cold,

05:27.760 --> 05:32.240
people are going to sleep. I moved to a new city recently, and I opened a business.

05:32.960 --> 05:36.640
I'm a pretty social guy, and I don't have trouble meeting people on a personal level,

05:36.640 --> 05:42.880
but I need to promote my business to build my clientele. What's the best way to go about

05:42.880 --> 05:47.360
promoting my business to people that I meet in a social setting without sounding too pushy and

05:47.360 --> 05:58.080
annoying? Brady. Brady, there's only one real way to grow your business. That's of course to become

05:58.080 --> 06:04.160
a sponsor of my brother and my brother and me. I mean, it is a great way. You get a lot for your

06:04.160 --> 06:14.800
money. Yeah. You know, you get the fame. We have literally tens of listeners. Yeah. You get the

06:14.800 --> 06:20.960
gravitas. You can't put a price on gravitas. You know what? You could get a special promotion. You

06:20.960 --> 06:25.520
meet one person. Meet one person that you want to impress at a social setting, right? Tell them to

06:25.520 --> 06:31.040
listen to this new podcast, and then you pay us to tell them about your business. That seems a

06:31.040 --> 06:36.320
little backwards. No, it's good. It'll be good. Because they'll say, hey, I know a show you can

06:36.320 --> 06:41.600
listen to specifically this episode. And then when they listen, we'll tell them about your business.

06:41.600 --> 06:48.800
Hey, have you heard of Brady's photocopies? Our friend Brady does the best photocopies.

06:50.000 --> 06:58.720
The print quality is just superb. No line breakage or splotch zones. Those margins to die for. So

06:58.720 --> 07:03.840
tight. Is that ivory blend on that paper? Yeah, it is. That's all Brady uses at Brady's photocopies.

07:03.840 --> 07:13.680
Not a lot of pulp in here. This is a smooth pulp free zone. Brady, I think that you're having,

07:13.680 --> 07:19.440
like, this is sort of the classic question of sales, right? It's something that I'm not

07:19.440 --> 07:25.200
particularly good at. I don't know any answer. I'm great at sales. I am. Okay. I mean, I was

07:25.200 --> 07:30.480
saying I am good at sales. Well, help them then, Tracks. Help them then, for Christ's sake. Don't

07:30.480 --> 07:36.640
hold your light under a fucking bushel. I was just gonna say that if you really do think that

07:37.680 --> 07:43.760
what you have is a good service, like if you think you've got the best service, then you

07:43.760 --> 07:48.000
shouldn't feel any hit. Remember that you're not asking them for something. It's a win-win,

07:48.000 --> 07:52.720
or at least it should be. You have to put it in your head that they will want to hear about it,

07:52.720 --> 07:59.920
because that's how you think of your product. And my advice would be this. You want to be

07:59.920 --> 08:05.120
indirectly direct, where you don't want to bring up your business. You don't want to say,

08:05.120 --> 08:08.240
hey, my name is Brady. Let me tell you about my new business, because they're immediately

08:08.240 --> 08:16.480
going to shut off. You want to have a conversation that, like, leads to talking about your business.

08:17.120 --> 08:23.920
Yeah. You know, ask them what they do, so then they'll ask you what you do. Yeah, that's a

08:23.920 --> 08:28.320
pretty good idea. Get interested in them first. Remember, that's our old classic. That works if

08:28.320 --> 08:33.520
you want to have sex with someone or want to be their sole photocopy supplier. Also,

08:35.120 --> 08:39.920
those two things are basically the same. Those two things are basically the same,

08:39.920 --> 08:46.160
because there's a bed involved, right? Either way. Griffin, hit me with a Yahoo answer.

08:46.160 --> 08:52.880
I will absolutely do that. I got a nice eclectic. I got some mixed nuts,

08:53.600 --> 08:57.120
which is, by the way, what I'm going to start calling the Yahoo answer segment.

08:57.120 --> 09:01.840
Can we start playing, like, a sound effect after you say it? Like, boing, or something like that?

09:01.840 --> 09:09.040
Absolutely. But this week, we got some Valentine's Day questions and some not-Valentine's-Day

09:09.040 --> 09:14.960
questions. But let's start out with the former. It was sent in by Valentine's Day.

09:16.880 --> 09:21.920
Wow. It's become corporeal. It's tormenting you.

09:21.920 --> 09:27.920
I've been incepted. This one was sent in by Cal. Thank you, Cal. It's by Yahoo answer's user,

09:27.920 --> 09:36.080
ManMan, who asks, what type of collage should I do for my boo on Valentine's Day?

09:38.160 --> 09:43.360
I want to do a collage for my boyfriend of eight months. I would love to put some pictures of us

09:43.360 --> 09:47.680
and movie tickets of the movies we've seen together, but sadly, we don't have that right now.

09:47.680 --> 09:52.160
Just our memories. I threw away the tickets, and now I wish I should have not done that.

09:53.600 --> 09:58.480
Do you guys have any other suggestions I can make for him? What other collage can I make for him?

09:58.480 --> 09:59.600
A garbage collage.

10:01.440 --> 10:05.360
This should stand in place for the garbage I threw out earlier. This is different garbage,

10:05.360 --> 10:08.880
but it's symbolic. Hey, you should maybe not-

10:10.720 --> 10:16.240
Kyle, I made you a collage. Sadly, I burn everything that has to do with you the moment it

10:16.240 --> 10:21.440
no longer has use. I've saved no pictures or anything. If you were to die today, there would

10:21.440 --> 10:24.560
be no proof of your existence in my house. Here's all the pictures and movie tickets

10:24.560 --> 10:29.760
from my last boyfriend. I saved those. I don't know. It's weird. Don't read into that too much.

10:32.640 --> 10:38.080
I've scribbled out the Poseidon adventure, and I've written Hancock, which, if you'll remember,

10:38.720 --> 10:43.840
was our first date. It was not. You say it was not our first. You're right. That was him too.

10:43.840 --> 10:51.200
That was also Ron. What I've made you is words cut out of magazines like a serial killer.

10:52.560 --> 11:01.200
We went to movie summer. I love you so much, Derek. You're my one. You're my one. You're my only.

11:01.200 --> 11:05.600
I know your name's not Derek, but that's the only name I could find printed in the magazine.

11:05.600 --> 11:11.440
And this one says sassy. I just like the font on that.

11:11.440 --> 11:16.240
What do you want us to tell you? You don't have anything to make a collage out of.

11:16.240 --> 11:20.480
I threw my shit away, and I want to make a time capsule, but I don't have

11:21.040 --> 11:26.400
any shit to put in it because I'm irresponsible. I love the framework of this question of,

11:26.400 --> 11:31.120
I want to make a really romantic, personally touching thing. Please tell me what I should put

11:31.120 --> 11:38.480
on it. Let me tell you what I know about your relationship. How about you make a collage out

11:38.480 --> 11:46.800
of ugly collages? Hey, you didn't save the memory collage. The victory, the elbow grease,

11:46.800 --> 11:53.040
the memory collage is not gluing it to corkboard. That's not the part where it's impressive. It's

11:53.040 --> 11:58.160
impressive because you saved the shit. Did you just start liking him? Did you not like him for

11:58.160 --> 12:02.080
months and you're like, I'm going to get in this guy? It just occurred to me seven months in that

12:02.080 --> 12:11.920
we're dating. Why don't you draw some pictures of your memories and then use those pictures,

12:12.640 --> 12:22.880
use those illustrations as fodder for your collage. Draw a picture of you two sitting

12:22.880 --> 12:37.200
at Hancock and maybe like grazing hands cocks. He's making a hit. He's making Hancock.

12:39.200 --> 12:44.320
It's a classic. It's a classic. And Griffin, you actually have just described my favorite

12:44.320 --> 12:55.440
independent web comic. So it's exactly like that. So maybe just take him to dinner or something.

12:55.440 --> 12:59.920
Or maybe try again next year. Like maybe don't throw everything away that you get.

12:59.920 --> 13:04.640
Maybe collage isn't a good idea this year. How about a coupon for one free collage?

13:04.640 --> 13:13.840
It's redeemable in exactly 365 days. My wife and I have a one year old. Sorry. I don't know why

13:13.840 --> 13:22.000
that sounded so sad. He's super lame. The novelty's really gone. My wife and I have a one year old.

13:22.000 --> 13:29.360
When we found out that she was pregnant again. What? What are you saying? Slow your roll. Your

13:29.360 --> 13:36.000
wife. Okay. When we found out my wife was pregnant. Okay. We were really happy but knew that things

13:36.000 --> 13:41.600
are going to get tight money wise. We just found out the baby's actually twins. Oh shit. Worst.

13:41.600 --> 13:47.760
So now we're still excited but also freaking out a bit. Yeah. Our wedding anniversary is coming up

13:47.760 --> 13:52.400
and all the money is tight. Do you have any suggestions to make my soon to be worn out wife

13:52.400 --> 14:03.920
feel special? Thanks Frugal in Philly. Um. What can you do? Like can this woman is about to pass

14:03.920 --> 14:09.120
two human beings? You know you want to you want to make her feel special right? You're you're about

14:09.120 --> 14:13.520
to have three kids and not enough money for them. You want to make her feel special. Right now those

14:13.520 --> 14:19.520
kids have two parents. That's like eh. But if they have one parent can you imagine? Imagine that.

14:19.520 --> 14:24.160
There's only one of you. There's only you only have a mommy so that's pretty special because

14:24.160 --> 14:31.680
your daddy your daddy moved to Vegas. Three three parents. Sister wives. I know we're on a sister

14:31.680 --> 14:38.240
wife streak but like you got one parent per kid. Apparently you're having babies every year so

14:38.240 --> 14:42.320
maybe with two wives you could alternate it and they can at least have a year off. Yeah. I know

14:42.320 --> 14:47.760
you don't worry about your wife being worn out and at this rate she will be. Like yeah. So I would

14:47.760 --> 14:53.440
say get a second wife to maybe carry one of the twins. Is that is that possible? A brood wife.

14:55.680 --> 14:59.840
Get yourself a brood wife and then like one can be your society wife

15:00.720 --> 15:05.440
and then one can be your you know your gestating hive queen.

15:08.000 --> 15:15.840
Hi this is this is uh this is my second wife Crystal. Crystal. Her name is Crystal. It's not

15:15.840 --> 15:23.360
Chrysalis. I don't know why I thought that and her name is also not dx173pon so I don't believe

15:23.360 --> 15:29.680
people saying that either. And I certainly have I have never considered harvesting her jellies.

15:31.760 --> 15:38.160
For Valentine's Day I got you a second wife in a tank of plasma and we're just gonna use her to

15:38.160 --> 15:44.880
harvest organs and babies from. You're welcome. You're welcome. What did you get me? Oh a stone

15:44.880 --> 15:56.640
temple pilot CD. Thank you. Wow we're really even now. Oh shit. Um so what to get your wife?

15:56.640 --> 16:03.520
Have you considered a collage? Maybe a nice collage with some of the things you've done together.

16:05.120 --> 16:11.760
What about uh uh make a nice dinner? You know it seems so cliche but if you really

16:11.760 --> 16:16.080
can cook well and you can knock one out of the park that's so nice. And she's eating for three.

16:16.720 --> 16:24.480
Yeah. Or four. Check it. Check it. Double check it. You got trips. She got trips. Heard it here first.

16:26.160 --> 16:33.680
We got the scoop on your baby's itch. Uh you you really I I think that a one you know one night

16:33.680 --> 16:38.560
thing where you know you do the dinner and the movie and really do the real date thing can can

16:38.560 --> 16:45.120
be really nice. But I think that you can make a longer lasting difference here and just really

16:46.960 --> 16:53.200
I and I'm I'm making judgments about you but I mean it's it's it's just sort of general advice.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.320
Yeah right exactly because I don't know you may already be doing this but you know in every way

16:58.320 --> 17:04.160
you can especially over the next couple years do what you can for her. You know when you when you

17:04.160 --> 17:10.560
there are times when you know you might want to watch the big game or something uh and you know

17:11.840 --> 17:17.040
take that time and maybe do something to make her life a little easier because you know that sort of

17:17.600 --> 17:23.200
lubrication on the gears of life could be a gift that that people appreciate all year round.

17:24.320 --> 17:31.920
Not hard to box up sure. Yeah. What aren't all the best gifts? It's beautiful. Thank you

17:31.920 --> 17:36.560
Travis. I worked really hard on it and again the collage thing I can't yeah I can't endorse that

17:36.560 --> 17:44.560
enough. Last week I met a boy when I visited my friend at a different collage. He got my number

17:44.560 --> 17:52.080
and we've been texting ever since. He seems great except there is one problem whenever he texts me

17:52.080 --> 18:01.120
he refers to me as a boo. I don't know where he got the idea for this pet name but I really don't

18:01.120 --> 18:07.120
but I really dislike it and all pet names in general. How do I get him to stop calling me boo

18:07.120 --> 18:13.600
besides just saying stop calling me boo uh love the show and sorry if this makes Griffin feel

18:13.600 --> 18:21.520
lonely not your boo bear. Let me posit this. Okay. Is it possible that whenever he looks at you

18:21.520 --> 18:33.280
you freeze in place and disappear? Oh I got you. Oh good. Final links. Yeah these are the jokes.

18:34.400 --> 18:42.800
You know people always always uh email through these questions and a lot of times I think they

18:42.800 --> 18:47.280
the question should just be this there's a simple solution to my problem but I'm not gonna do it.

18:47.280 --> 18:54.800
Make up a harder one for me. Why do you want us to complicate your life? Let me check this.

18:54.800 --> 19:02.080
Check this heat. Hey I'm not I'm not crazy about that nickname. Hey I'm I am mad creeped. Can you

35:33.840 --> 35:38.880
of some advice would it be rude to suggest my husband to we sell my engagement ring yep

35:39.440 --> 35:45.840
whoa i'm into this question now elaboration yeah please my husband and i have been married for

35:45.840 --> 35:50.880
almost two years now and i never wear my engagement ring i chose a simple gold band for a wedding ring

35:50.880 --> 35:56.160
which i prefer and wear all the time my engagement ring is worth over two thousand dollars it is just

35:56.160 --> 36:00.960
sitting in a drawer in my house and won't remain there until this lost stolen or given away the

36:00.960 --> 36:07.200
practical side of me wants to sell my ring but is this a subject best left alone dana dana there's

36:07.200 --> 36:15.680
no good way to breach this with dana this is a like yeah this is a no win situation let me

36:15.680 --> 36:22.160
put it to you in like a practical a way a practical person will understand um unless you like need

36:22.160 --> 36:26.800
the money do you if you don't need the money then you never you never know you might have a kid you

36:26.800 --> 36:33.040
might have a daughter or a son someday um the the engagement ring i gave my wife was passed down to

36:33.040 --> 36:42.080
me from my my grandmother so you know it's it you you never know you might want to to reuse it in

36:42.080 --> 36:49.440
that sense um or make some really bitchin ear jewelry like you just you never know uh but that

36:49.440 --> 36:55.440
it's a that's a no that's that's a loser that's got loser printed all over that that convo you

36:55.440 --> 37:00.960
have with your hubs here here's my suggestion start referring to things in terms of the cost

37:00.960 --> 37:06.000
of the wedding rings our engagement ring so if your husband's looking at a new tv say yeah that'd

37:06.000 --> 37:18.400
be about one and a half engagement rings that's much better advice actually that's a really nice

37:18.400 --> 37:22.640
speed but what do you say frank that's like three engagement rings four engagement rings it's not

37:22.640 --> 37:31.120
bad that's what we'll name it when we buy it by selling this engagement ring oh man it is that

37:31.120 --> 37:37.280
screen is big you know i know you like the 30 inch but for about half engagement ring we can go up

37:37.280 --> 37:44.880
to 50 that ring upgrade um i mean do you need the cash like if you don't need it just it's

37:45.520 --> 37:50.640
why not have it it's like a think of it is another way it's like a nest egg it's like a

37:50.640 --> 37:56.400
a rainy day fund it's gonna depreciate though in value when people stop giving out engagement rings

37:56.400 --> 38:01.280
right because what what's that gonna happen uh i mean people are just gonna people are just gonna

38:01.280 --> 38:06.800
rise above it people don't are gonna realize they don't need physical representations of their sweet

38:06.800 --> 38:13.600
love oh yes say it in the words and just like say it and the words are all that matters in the

38:13.600 --> 38:21.920
future that sounds good yeah i read about it tell your husband that listen in the future i wrote it

38:21.920 --> 38:29.440
down somewhere but uh i'm basically so i sold my engagement ring the thesis of this story is that

38:29.440 --> 38:34.400
i no longer have that ring you bought me with your three-month salary do you want to go deeper

38:34.400 --> 38:40.240
because that's i pretty much gave you the abstract on this little paper i've written about this

38:41.440 --> 38:50.080
also um whoa some ice just fell off my roof that was scary uh also spring is springing three

38:50.080 --> 38:57.760
months salary two thousand dollars that doesn't seem right to me you either got played are you

38:57.760 --> 39:04.480
dude's bank account is busted what you should bring up all of these things you should bring up

39:04.480 --> 39:10.960
all the this this here is an embarrassment stanley let me refer to my powerpoint presentation about

40:52.320 --> 40:59.200

41:00.480 --> 41:06.480
this is our new perfume eva mendez's vagina strangely it smells like oranges and cinnamon

41:06.480 --> 41:14.160
which you would never guess can we just call it mint mendez been dead from for my personal

41:14.800 --> 41:21.440
fragrance i would want to be something beefy because i'm a you know i'm a dude i'm out there

41:21.440 --> 41:30.000
making deals making plays in business something beefy but kind of like like cigarettes like kind

41:30.000 --> 41:37.120
of like beef and cigarettes okay okay yeah i call it big business because that's what i'm out there

41:37.120 --> 41:42.880
doing oh i actually love that that's a direct name for cologne big business it smells like raw beef

41:42.880 --> 41:48.080
and cigarettes okay i don't like that part as much does somebody make a money perfume

41:50.000 --> 41:54.640
this is my perfume ballin it smells like money no no it would be more tasteful than that it would

41:54.640 --> 42:00.880
come in a it would look like a maybe a piggy bank that's a little good uh-huh maybe a dollar sign

42:00.880 --> 42:11.600
maybe just call it like crisp bills or just like or just crisp rollin rollin see you guys are you're

42:11.600 --> 42:20.480
thinking about a sort of a hip-hop superstar affectation making it rain and it would it would

42:20.480 --> 42:26.080
smell like rain and money like money that's been left out in the rain hey what can we talk

42:26.080 --> 42:30.960
about the atmospheric situation in your bedroom right now devin because it right now it's supposed

42:30.960 --> 42:35.440
like it's been raining money and i don't think that like meteorologically i don't think that

42:35.440 --> 42:42.080
that's a sound scenario for you to be sleeping in i would i wouldn't want mine to smell like my two

42:42.080 --> 42:52.400
favorite smells which is um baby skin and campfires wowzers that first one was like super creepy yeah

42:52.400 --> 42:57.360
but then you combine it with the campfire and you imagine the smell of baby skin on a camp

42:57.360 --> 43:02.240
cracklin baby skin that's travis all over that's actually what i would call it cracklin

43:04.800 --> 43:10.240
that's really upsetting travis it smells like burning baby skin and even mendez's vagina

43:10.240 --> 43:15.200
it's called cracklin and it's a fragrance and you can buy it at the store and mendez

43:16.160 --> 43:25.280
costs eight dollars don't don't be fooled by this department store riposte like sizzling

43:26.080 --> 43:32.720
it's eight so it's just like it but it smells like toddler skin on a gas burner and

43:32.720 --> 43:40.240
dorothea lang's vagina don't don't be fooled don't be fooled by imitators i uh i think if i

ever became a solo folk artist just traveling around the country with my guitar and a harmonica

43:46.480 --> 43:51.760
