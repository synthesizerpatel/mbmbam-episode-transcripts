00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:21.000 --> 00:31.000
It's familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar.

00:31.000 --> 00:45.000
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say hey I wanna, just say hey I wanna.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin Tyler McElroy.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis Patrick McElroy.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin Penelope McElroy.

01:02.000 --> 01:10.000
Justin, you were just telling us before we started recording, and you expressed some hesitance to actually want to talk about this on the program.

01:10.000 --> 01:18.000
That you have just purchased a new vehicle, and I think there's a lot of legs here.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
I hope there's not a lot of legs on the car, Griffin.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
It could be a fucking My Neighbor Totoro cat bus, but no, it's probably a four-wheeled vehicle car.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
And I just wanted to sort of dive into like the decision, because I know you're such a gearbox.

01:34.000 --> 01:43.000
And I know that you really like to get into these vehicles and really inspect them, bumper-to-bumper guarantee.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Yeah, for sure.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
And just go over all the parts and try and maximize the efficiency.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
See how the parts go? Yeah, upgradability, being able to put some turbo in there is huge to me.

01:53.000 --> 02:00.000
Usually you wanna make sure that it's got room for turbo, because you buy a car and the trunk's all full of parts already, you don't have room for turbo.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
Where's the nocks go? Where's the nocks? The nocks.

02:06.000 --> 02:13.000
So walk me through sort of the decision-making process that you went through that led you down the winding road to your new whip.

02:13.000 --> 02:23.000
Well, I almost bought a Honda Odyssey, which is a minivan, because it had a built-in vacuum in it. Have you ever heard of such a thing?

02:23.000 --> 02:32.000
So a built-in vacuum, how does, like, the engine has a vacuum to suck the fuel up into the engine to make it go faster?

02:32.000 --> 02:39.000
No, there's a vacuum in the back that you can pull out, it's got a huge tube, and you turn on the engine and it just sucks.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
And you can clean up all the baby detritus.

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
That's fun, because you can look at your friends and they'd be like, why did you buy this? And you would say, because this car sucks.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
And you would all have a good laugh. Or a medium laugh.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
So it's not, like, for going, it's for, like, Cheez-Its.

02:57.000 --> 03:04.000
Yeah, it's like, I almost got this car because it had a built-in vacuum.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
What was the engine like on that one, though?

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Oh, it used gas.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Oh, man, you got it.

03:13.000 --> 03:20.000
Hey, Justin, quick question about this vehicle. I know you didn't go with it, but is it got hemi?

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
Yeah, if I wanted to go farther, I could stop in pretty much any gas station.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Oh, hell yes.

03:28.000 --> 03:38.000
Actually, I wasn't planning on buying a new vehicle, but I had to because the Germans tried to kill the planet with my car.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
They made my car into a planet-killing sleeper agent.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Hold on, don't blame that on all Germans.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
It was the Germans.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
No, they zagged on me and Justin pretty hard with these VWs.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
It was a pretty big zag.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Mine is killing the planet.

03:52.000 --> 04:00.000
It's definitely draining Gaia of the live stream or whatever, but it goes so fast and I like how it looks.

04:00.000 --> 04:09.000
Your unwillingness to part with this car has been fascinating to me because I was so stoked when they offered to take it back from me

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
because I bought it during, I guess, Sydney and I were having a simultaneous midlife crisis

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
and we bought this convertible Beetle that you can't put a car seat in and then we had a baby, so that was whack.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Then the Germans lied and they killed the planet with my car.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
They zagged you, yeah.

04:23.000 --> 04:29.000
Plus, isn't someone offering to take your car away and give you money back for it so you can get a different car?

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
Even if you love your car, just like, I can just do a different car now?

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Yeah.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Not if you just bought it a year ago and you don't like car shopping.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Anyway, Justin loves car shopping and I want to get back into it.

04:41.000 --> 04:49.000
So, tell me about the vehicle that you did end up, any other candidates that you were thinking about just based on sort of their specs?

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
Hi, if you're just joining us, welcome to Car Talk, the new Car Talk 2.0.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
Car Talk Extreme Baja Blast.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
So, basically, I was thinking also about Kia Sorento.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
Now, that's a very fuckable ride.

05:07.000 --> 05:15.000
Well, you know, we were looking for something with three rows that wouldn't be too terrible, you know?

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
So, I was thinking about maybe a Kia Sorento, but we ended up going with a Honda Pilot.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
What's the spoiler like on that?

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Spoiler, I love it.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
It's just a great ride all around.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
That's another car joke that I got.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
And how's this baby hump the road?

05:32.000 --> 05:41.000
When you get her out there and you're taking the turns through the country, is she humping the road or nah?

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
I basically just drive it from my house to Rite Aid and back.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
Yeah, what kind of like, you time that?

05:48.000 --> 05:56.000
Yeah, I can get from my house to Rite Aid in like five minutes, which is about how long it took with my last car.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Nice.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
This one has three rows, so that's nice.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
What's the engine smell like when it heats up?

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Yeah, it's a good one, Trav.

06:04.000 --> 06:12.000
You know, just like a motor burning.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Head out on the highway, you know?

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Do you want me to say freedom? I mean, it's just a Honda Pilot.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
Gas-wise, gas-wise, are we talking diesel or are we talking about that regular tan stuff?

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Or like old french fry stuff?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
I'm never buying a diesel car again.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Nobody sells diesel.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Never buying that again.

06:29.000 --> 06:35.000
I'm sorry the Germans tricked me into killing the planet with diesel. Sorry.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
Diesel's good for the planet. The planet drinks that shit up.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
That's what they try to tell me. Try to sell me on that.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Have you done any sort of mods?

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Because I know like you are a real gearbox and I love you.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
And I know that you like to get under the hood and under the car.

06:51.000 --> 06:59.000
You know, they have the little dolly that you lay down on and I see you sometimes just sliding around on that.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Just having like the best day ever.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
When you're hanging with your crew.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Yeah, your pit crew.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
Yeah, I have made a couple of additions in there.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Oh, nice.

07:11.000 --> 07:20.000
One of the things was it didn't have, well, my garage door opener wasn't clipped to the thing.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
Little salvage job from the last whip.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
And that's going to pick you up like two or three miles per hour just right there.

07:27.000 --> 07:33.000
Yeah, and then also it didn't have any disc in the...

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
And the tires, those are called rims.

07:35.000 --> 07:43.000
There was no disc in the Blu-ray player and then I swapped that not having a disc out with Peppa Pig Muddy Puddles and other stories.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Nice.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Yeah, so I did that swap.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
And how does that tweak the torque? Pretty good?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
It's booming actually.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
I can really feel it when they jump in those muddy puddles.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
I can feel it, the sound system.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
The tweeters and woofers and stuff are really booming on that.

07:58.000 --> 08:05.000
Now, Justin, when you're doing your illegal street racing and you really hit the height of that Peppa Pig episode,

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
do you feel like that's the boost you need to get you over that old finish line?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Yeah.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Just a second question to add onto that.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Is it also the closest that you feel to seeing God's face?

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Yeah.

08:19.000 --> 08:25.000
Sometimes I confuse the voice of Daddy Pig with the voice of God because they've both got very low rumbles.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Just when you're in that speed zone.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Sure.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
When you're transcending.

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
I would actually like to mention that I had to do a pretty sad...

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
This is pretty savage actually.

08:38.000 --> 08:45.000
I had to bring back the car, the Beetle, and I had to walk through the dealership and they had already closed

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
and they were just sitting around.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
This is where my appointment was.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
They were all sitting around, just chatting, and they asked me how they could help me.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
I had to tell them, I'm here to sell back my car to you.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Take this car from me.

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
They looked very downtrodden and dejected.

09:04.000 --> 09:11.000
The Honda dealership is actually on the same lot, so I just walked out the door and walked over to the other place.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Just waving a wad of cash in front of you.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
Hey, listen, these suckers just bought back my Beetle.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Got them.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Justin, I'm so happy for you.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I know you love your beautiful toys.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
You're a real Jay Leno.

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
I'm just really excited for you to just have a new canvas to sort of do your art on.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
Whatever you do, don't get out there and start racing for pinks again.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Yeah.

09:35.000 --> 09:41.000
One thing that is hard is if my garage door is open and I try to open the back of the car,

09:41.000 --> 09:47.000
there's not enough room, so I have to mod either the garage door or the car.

09:47.000 --> 09:54.000
So now you're hoping that there's a secret planet-killing device inside of this car so that you can fix this mistake you've made.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Yeah, this is a big whiff.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I'm going to have to try again.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
That's not a bad car shopping technique.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
I'm not looking for city versus highway miles per gallon.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
I'm not looking for any kind of aesthetic.

10:07.000 --> 10:14.000
I'm looking for the car that secretly has a device inside of it that is killing the planet so that in like a year or so I can get another free new whip.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
Yeah, the only MPGs I care about is mendacity per gallon.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
I just want to know how many lies you can stuff in there.

10:22.000 --> 10:33.000
So when I uncover the lot, when some enterprising gearhead like myself discovers the lies that you hid in your car, it's like leasing.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
It's lysing.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
It's just like you find cars with lies in them.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
It's fleecing.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
It's fleecing.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
There we go.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
There we found it.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Can we please do a show?

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
I warned you guys it wouldn't be funny.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Dude, no, you did good, and it was funny, and I loved it.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
It was good.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Justin.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
I'm a pretty practical car shopper at this point.

10:51.000 --> 11:00.000
Listen, I had my fun with my 1982 Malibu and my 1992 Cutlass Sierra.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
I have owned that Cutlass Sierra.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
I had a lot of work in.

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
I had a lot of fun with my Kia Sophia and my Kia Sportage.

11:08.000 --> 11:14.000
Listen, I've had my fun, you know, my fun cars, and now my Subaru Outback.

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
Now I'm just ready to like settle down with a little more grown-up ride.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
How about some questions?

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
I've wasted my youth.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Yeah.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Hey, brothers.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
I recently started up a band with a couple of friends of mine.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
I'm the lead singer.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Fuck yeah.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Slash guitarist, slash songwriter.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
The problem is our bassist isn't very good.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Listen, I see where this is going.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
The answer is yes.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
I will take the job.

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
Here, let me give you a sample.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Hi.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
Sorry, are you finished?

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
No, hold on.

11:52.000 --> 11:58.000
Wait a minute.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Wow, he was pretty good.

12:01.000 --> 12:08.000
My name's Griffin, and I'd also like to apply for the job.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
I would also like to throw my hat in the ring, please.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
Bass, bass, bass, bass, bass, bass, bass, bass, bass, bass, bass.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Hey, you've got a sound we've never heard before.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
We must have you.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Thank you very much.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
One million dollars.

12:23.000 --> 12:30.000
The actual problem is what's worse is he frequently argues with me about how our songs, which I wrote, should sound.

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
I try my best to take his opinion into account, but most of the time his take on a song is flat out bad.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
I feel really bad kicking him out.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
How can I deal with this without breaking up the band?

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
That's from Cacophonus in Canada.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Liam, Liam, I love this Wonderwall song.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
Have you thought about doing it very, very fast?

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
And maybe super happy.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
Super fast and happy, and also very loud electric guitars.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
It's whiny in it.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
It's a little whiny in it.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
What if it was much faster, like 210 BPM?

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
What if you did it more like Pharrell?

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
You like Pharrell?

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
You like Pharrell?

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
I've been listening to a lot of Pharrell.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
What if we called it the Thunderwall?

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
What if we got LMFAO to do a verse?

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Oh, that'd be nice.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
That'd be good.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Actually, this song sounds fucking really good.

13:21.000 --> 13:28.000
Thunderwall by LMFAO, a 210 BPM fucking trance hit featuring Oasis.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
It'll be on the Facebook group by the end of the week.

13:32.000 --> 13:38.000
You often hear about bands that get famous and then kick somebody out.

13:38.000 --> 13:44.000
And then you hear about bands that kick somebody out and then get famous.

13:44.000 --> 13:52.000
I'm thinking of Pete Best that happened with Pete Best.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
The original drummer from the Oneaters?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Yeah, the original drummer.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Okay, this is good.

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
The Metallica kicks out Dave Mustaine, they get huge.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Beatles kick out Pete Best, they get huge.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
Oneaters kick out the original drummer, they get huge.

14:07.000 --> 14:13.000
I'm thinking maybe this guy from where he's not very good at it

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
and causing discord, thank you, within the band.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
Maybe if you kick him out, the band would be better?

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Maybe?

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
And you would get famous right away?

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
He's the catalyst.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
This is such a precarious situation because you are the songwriter,

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
lead singer, head of the band, right?

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
But you don't want to come off as a complete prick, right?

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
And I get that.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
And I think you do have to walk a pretty delicate line here.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
Now, on the other side of things, where the fuck does this bassist get off?

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
Where the fuck does this bassist get off?

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
I love a good bassist.

14:50.000 --> 14:55.000
I mean, shit, some of my favorites are very important to me,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
but I'm going to keep them a secret.

14:57.000 --> 15:03.000
That's not what a bassist do though.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
McCartney was a bassist, right?

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
And then Beatles, I guess he probably had a few things to say.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Or was that Harrison?

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
I'm sorry, I have to stop you guys.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
I'm very uncomfortable right now because you're both just kind of like

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
casually endorsing bassism.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Oh, Jesus.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Thank you.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Hi, everybody.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
It's Travis McElroy here.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
I would like to jump in now and say a thing.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
I'm quitting the show and doing my own spinoff of a bit.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
It's just me saying bad puns.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
It's called Believe It or Not, I'm Doing My Best.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
With Pete Best.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
With Pete Best.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
With Travis McElroy, Pete Best.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
Boy, we just couldn't get it together, could we?

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Nope.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
And look how much more successful everybody else is doing now.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
Okay, I've never formed a band before.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
I have no idea what goes into it.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
But what's the pre-probe before you let somebody into a band like this

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
that you only later find out, like, oh, you're not good at music.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Whoops.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
Like, isn't that a thing that you should find out free-forming?

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
I want you to imagine it or something for me, okay?

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
You're you, okay?

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
And you're doing – somebody's like, I know a cool bassist.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
And you're like, okay, great.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
And he gets up and you're like, show me what you got.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
And he's like, brum brum brum brum brum brum brum.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
And you're like, okay, cool.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
It sounds like you got it.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Like, there's no way to tell if he's good at it or not.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
Wait, you're saying there's no way to tell if a bassist is good?

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
Yeah, you can't tell if a bassist is good or not.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Well.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Well.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Sorry.

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
We're living in 2020 when we have to do a bass arts thing where we pay $500 to bassists

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
to make up for everything we've said about them in the past.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
No, I love a fucking fresh bass line.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
Like, there's some good – you're saying there's no way to tell if a bassist is good?

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
What are you talking about?

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
I know who good bassists are.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
They do, like, Flea.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
He's good.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Okay.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Bootsy Collins.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
Geddy Lee.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
Like, there's a lot of very good bassists out there that play the bass, and it sounds

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
good when they play it.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Vic Wooten.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Okay, now you're looking at a fucking Google list.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
No, I know Vic Wooten.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Oh, yeah.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
He played with – what's that guy's name?

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
Dad likes him.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Bella Fleck.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Oh, yeah.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
Yeah, no, that's very, very talented.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
We're digging ourselves a bassist hole, and I want to get out of it.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
I'm just kidding.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
I'm doing, like, old jokes about bassists.

17:36.000 --> 17:41.000
I know that you all have had it rough, and I'm sorry about piling on here.

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
I don't mean it, and I don't want to hear from you.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
More importantly –

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
More importantly, and I can't stress this enough, I don't want to be educated.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Okay, please.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
I've learned so much and grown so much.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
I can afford to write off this group of people.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
No, that's not – you already have that group of people, and it's jugglers.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
You don't get a second slot.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
But please, don't educate.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
I don't want to know.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Here's the question.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
Here's the question for Question Writer.

18:08.000 --> 18:14.000
Because you really have to take a long, hard look in the mirror and decide,

18:14.000 --> 18:20.000
do you think that this band is going to go somewhere, or is this a fun –

18:20.000 --> 18:26.000
like, we get together on the weekends, you know, maybe three times a month if we can swing it

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
and make the schedule work, play some songs together, drink some beers,

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
and then we usually end up playing Mario Kart kind of thing.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
Because if it's that second one, it's going to be fine.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
Just, like, breathe deep and, like, listen to their shitty suggestions

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
and then just go on with whatever.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
It'll be fine.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
If you actually think, like, no, this is what I want to do for a living,

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
this is my career, and then we're really trying to make a go of this,

18:49.000 --> 18:54.000
then you have to take that into account, and you've got to cut this person loose.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
Because if this is your job and they are not good at it and they are hard to work with,

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
the last thing you want is, like, you play a concert and someone's like, hey, that's great.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
I would love to sign you guys.

19:04.000 --> 19:11.000
And now you are stuck with them forever, and, like, that is what tears your band apart in two years

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
because you can't stand one member of it.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
You know, it's funny.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
One of the things that you – like, when you're creating something,

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
one of the things that I have learned and this – I have found –

19:21.000 --> 19:28.000
I've discovered, like, why some people who are actually celebrities, I think,

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
get the reputation of being, like, hard to work with, I think.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
Because I think when you're creating something and it's a collaborative thing,

19:35.000 --> 19:41.000
especially, like, if you're writing the songs and creating that stuff,

19:41.000 --> 19:47.000
other – you think about your own stuff probably 50 to 100 times more than other people think about it.

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
But when you're working on it together, they want to have equal say in it.

19:52.000 --> 19:58.000
And I think that it's okay if you're creating something and you have, like, an idea of what you want to create.

19:58.000 --> 20:07.000
I think it's okay for you to relax some of the, like, social convention of, like, how people normally, like, interact.

20:07.000 --> 20:12.000
I don't think it's inconsiderate, I guess is what I'm saying, or inhumane to have a creative vision

20:12.000 --> 20:20.000
and want people who are going to, like, support it and help you realize it rather than try to fight you at every corner.

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
That's not to say that, you know, something can't be gained through conflict,

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
because I think that creative work is filled with stories like that.

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
But I do think that if it's not gelling with this person and you're serious about this, then, you know, there's –

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
it's not like – it's like – it's a professional setting, you know.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
They're not working for the project that you're doing.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
I don't think you should feel bad about making that clear.

20:43.000 --> 20:48.000
Kick them the fuck out, and maybe you'll be doing them a favor and they'll be like Pete Best,

20:48.000 --> 20:54.000
who started a band called The Better Beatles, and they were – they were. They were better.

20:54.000 --> 21:03.000
They did White Album too. We Did It Better This Time. Two Revolvers. Do you remember that album?

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Do you remember Two Revolvers?

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
That's the one that's better than Revolver?

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
Yeah, because they had two guns the whole time.

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
I hope Paul McCartney never dies. Obviously. But I think –

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Full stop.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
Full stop. I want to make that clear up front.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
But I think we all know deep down he will die before Ringo Starr does.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
Like, I think we're all pretty clear about that happening. I just hope –

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
He will win the Tontine.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
Yeah. I just hope – and that Tontine is this.

21:32.000 --> 21:39.000
I just hope that Ringo Starr has the guts to do a solo tour marketed as a Beatles reunion tour.

21:39.000 --> 21:45.000
I just want – I just want – and here's the thing. No other instruments can be on stage.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
It is just Ringo Starr playing drums –

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
And he also does like the few harmonies, so it's just like –

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
That sounds – again, that sounds –

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
That sounds fucking good.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
I didn't know you were a bassist and a drummer.

22:05.000 --> 22:10.000
All right. So listen. Right? Peace and love. Peace and love. I want the –

22:10.000 --> 22:17.000
The left third of the auditorium, you're George, okay? So like, you do George stuff.

22:17.000 --> 22:24.000
And middle third, you're – John was him. And then right third, you're Paul.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
So you do Paul stuff, and I'm just going to do Ringo stuff.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
All right. I hate to stop you again.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
You were a little off, George, part of the crowd. Please get it together.

22:34.000 --> 22:39.000
Hey, George. Hey, whichever one of you Georgians is fucking up, raise your hand.

22:39.000 --> 22:44.000
All right. You have to leave the concert because you're dragging us down.

22:44.000 --> 22:49.000
74 of you are fired from the band. The best Beatles.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Take that, BeatBest. Put that in your fucking pipe.

22:51.000 --> 22:56.000
But you wish you thought of that name, didn't you? You're a bastard.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
Okay. Yahoo time. I got one here from level 9000.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
Thank you, Drew. It's by Yajuransersuser.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
Parami, and I don't think it's going to be a meaty one,

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
but it's something we need to fucking discuss right now.

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
Parami asks, I just heard the new company is finally taking over Yahoo.

23:12.000 --> 23:18.000
What will happen to our emails and Yahoo Answers? This saddens me. Saw it on the news.

23:18.000 --> 23:24.000
I saw it on the news this morning that Verizon's company, that Alibaba or Aldaba

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
or whatever the hell it's called will be replacing Yahoo here in a few.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
I hate this so much. I hate it. I love answering questions on Yahoo Answers.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
Me too. I fucking love being a member of this community,

23:35.000 --> 23:40.000
and I don't know what Altauba is going to do with it now that they are Yahoo,

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
and I'm not sure what the business arrangement here.

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
I know Melissa Mayer is on the way out, and she has been a stalwart guardian.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
She was the one behind, I don't know if you guys know this,

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
there's a new app called Yahoo Answers Now.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Hello, Yahoo Answers Now. I'm so glad to meet you.

23:54.000 --> 24:00.000
I'm glad you came out like a couple months ago when the fucking fires are the hottest,

24:00.000 --> 24:05.000
when the Yahoo Answers sun has reached its zenith in the sky.

24:05.000 --> 24:11.000
But now she's gone. Altauba's here. Nobody quite knows what's going to happen to Yahoo Answers,

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
but I'll tell you what's going to happen. It's gone. It's gone.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
It's going to die and be gone, and then this podcast is going to die and be gone.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
You can't just turn off a website, Griffin.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
Sorry?

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
You can't just stop a website.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
You can't stop the signal?

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
You can't stop the signal, Griffin.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
What are they going to do, just not anymore?

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
What's that even look like? You know what I mean?

24:33.000 --> 24:38.000
Yeah, I guess they've already uploaded all the data to the web.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
It's not like a building you can tear down.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
They're not going to close their doors.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
Let's really think about this, though.

24:45.000 --> 24:50.000
It's not like they can just suck the data back down from the web.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
Once you put the data up there, it's like up there.

24:53.000 --> 25:00.000
I'm trying to work through this. I have Yahoo Answers tabs open on my computer right now.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
I have the data. They can't take it off my computer, right?

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
Is Altaba going to come and destroy my MacBook?

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
No. It's important to note that Yahoo, the company,

25:13.000 --> 25:21.000
sold its verticals and its internet business and all that stuff to Verizon.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
So, Verizon bought that stuff.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Yes.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
What's left is Altaba.

25:26.000 --> 25:31.000
So, I don't think Altaba will have any connection to Yahoo, the entity.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
Okay. So, where does that leave my precious Altaba Ants?

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
Just saying that. It felt like poop falling out of my mouth.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Altaba Ants.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
Awful, awful mouthfeel.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
What's going to happen to it, Justin?

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Because you know more about this business.

25:48.000 --> 25:56.000
I know I'm the Forbes 30 under 30 luminary, but you are like Bloomberging out.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
It's actually the Washington Post that I'm reading, but yeah, for sure.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Fuck.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
Yeah. So, it's going to be Altaba.

26:03.000 --> 26:10.000
Am I going to be able to get on here and find out what to do because I shoved a whole 18-inch pizza up my butt?

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
Am I still going to have this utility available to me?

26:14.000 --> 26:20.000
Can we agree that Yahoo was never a very good name, or do we think it was a good name?

26:20.000 --> 26:26.000
I mean, they had that fun theme song where it was like, yeah, whoo, whoo.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
I don't think you can call that a theme song, Griffin.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Yeah, sure you can, dude.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Yeah, you can.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
Top 10 TV theme songs of all time.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
Okay.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Scrubs.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
That's my favorite TV theme song.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Yeah.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
So, I'm just really worried.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
I know there's not much to talk about here, and there's a lot of uncertainty in the air,

26:49.000 --> 26:54.000
but I didn't want the next episode of MyBimBam to be like, and here's an Altaba answers,

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
and there's no groundwork for it, you know?

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
It's just some things are important.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
I have another guy who does that.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Words don't mean things.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
Hold on, though.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
I don't want to leave it there.

27:07.000 --> 27:16.000
Zag, what if Altaba comes in and like turns this shit around and suddenly everybody's username loads on the first time every time?

27:16.000 --> 27:21.000
And there's no more, you'll never believe that Melissa McCarthy is dead ads that pop up, you know?

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Oh, my God.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
That's my dream, but I'd still have to say Altaba answer.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
Altaba.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Altaba.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
Altaba answers.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
I feel like an asshole just saying it.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Alt answers.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
No, then it's no.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
No.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Okay, I'm going to read another Altaba.

27:40.000 --> 27:44.000
I'm just going to practice it so that like when it does switch over, it's normal.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
Here's an Altaba answers from another one from Altaba.

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
Level 9000, Altaba Druid.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
See fucking.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
Drew Davenport, thank you.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
It's from the Nikki Bella who asks.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
I don't think this is the wrestler woman, but she asks.

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
Is Ronald McDonald a virgin or did he lose his virginity?

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
This is the stuff that like, I don't want to be gone.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
It can't be gone.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
I don't know that.

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
I want, but if he did, it was with Wendy.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
All right.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
Like, do we finally go too deep for you, Travis?

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
Maybe.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
This might be.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
Was it with Wendy or was it with the Taco Bell dog?

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
No, it was.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
Here's my question, you guys.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Maybe it's with the Burger King.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
Hello.

28:37.000 --> 28:49.000
Do you think that this is why there have been different iterations of Ronald McDonald over the year that when he gives away his treasure, his toy surprise.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
Yeah.

28:50.000 --> 28:57.000
Then they have to like, he is then free to leave and a new Ronald McDonald is brought in.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Yeah.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
Like this, like the Dread Pirate Roberts.

29:01.000 --> 29:15.000
So is there a test you could do on Ronald McDonald's to see if they're still virginal?

29:15.000 --> 29:24.000
Now, would this be some sort of medical swab or what are you suggesting?

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Or some kind of like word puzzle?

29:26.000 --> 29:30.000
I think you could just ask him because I don't think he can lie.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
He cannot lie to a child.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
No, well, we'd need a child to ask him because he can't lie to a child.

29:34.000 --> 29:39.000
A child has to ask him if he's had sex and he can't lie to a child.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
No, absolutely not.

29:41.000 --> 29:47.000
And also, if he's lost his virginity, French fries turn to ash in his mouth.

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
You have to wait until you see the white smoke come out of the chimney of Burger King.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Yeah.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
What is Burger King going to say?

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
Well, they just announce it because it's weird for McDonald's to talk about.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
And I also meant to say McDonald's.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
Just sort of acoustically, I can tell.

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
Are you talking like, is your face in your hands in disgust right now?

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
It's basically sort of, my hands are here.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
They're sort of rubbing my head.

30:14.000 --> 30:22.000
I'm just thinking about if we can come back from this.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
I mean, the McDonald's sponsorship is out.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
I think we can all agree that now that ship is sailed, correct?

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
I mean, I don't, I would be, I'm fine with that.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
I'm, you know, I'm scrupled.

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
Me and fucking Spurlock, me and Morgan Spurlock hanging out all the time.

30:38.000 --> 30:43.000
If that fool sees me with a big and tasty in my gob, he will never, he'll cut me off.

30:43.000 --> 30:49.000
He will think you're eating a five-year-old hamburger, which would be a bit, yeah, that would be...

30:49.000 --> 30:57.000
What if McDonald's though, the ad campaign for 2017 was, he did it.

30:57.000 --> 31:02.000
And I'm not saying in the commercial we have to see Ronald McDonald making love.

31:02.000 --> 31:09.000
I'm just saying like, like the new commercial is that same Ronald McDonald, do you believe in magic, man?

31:09.000 --> 31:16.000
But now he's, he's wearing like some fucking cool blue jeans and he's just like walking down the street all smooth.

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
Slick back, you know, and he's wearing some real cool like Warby Parker shades.

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
Yeah. And it's like, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, he did it.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Call me Ron now.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Call me Ron now. I made love.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
I want to paint the ad for you. Allow me to paint this picture.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
Yeah.

31:32.000 --> 31:41.000
We light up on a sad little, probably seven-year-old boy sitting on a bench outside of Mickey D's.

31:41.000 --> 31:48.000
And he's like, obviously downtrodden, he's wearing a medal that says second place in soccer.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
And he's obviously...

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Wait, the medal says second place in soccer.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
Can you please not interrupt me while I'm doing my ad?

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
The medal says second place in soccer.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
Okay.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
And then you hear like, boom, boom, boom, boom.

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
And Ron McDonald sits down next to him.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
Ron McDonald.

32:06.000 --> 32:11.000
He pops his collar and he's like, hey, kid, you having a rough day?

32:11.000 --> 32:16.000
And the kid's like, yeah, I guess you could say that, Ron.

32:16.000 --> 32:21.000
And Ron says, well, I know just the thing that could turn that around.

32:21.000 --> 32:26.000
And the kid's like, burgers and fries from McDonald's?

32:26.000 --> 32:32.000
And Ron says, um, yeah, that could work too, I guess.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
And then he, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
As he lowers his shade and looks right at the camera, freeze frame.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
Uh-huh.

32:38.000 --> 32:46.000
And then the new tagline that he says directly to the camera is, McDonald's, it's what kids have to do to feel good.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
He puts his sunglasses...

32:48.000 --> 32:52.000
And then like, it fades to black.

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
And then the lights come back up and he's still got his sunglasses down.

32:56.000 --> 33:00.000
And he's like, but not adults, if you know what I mean.

33:00.000 --> 33:06.000
And he wakes and then black out and then the lights come back up and he's still got his sunglasses down.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
And he says, I mean, have sex.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
I did it.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
I did it.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
Good too.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Now read my new book.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
Let me fucking paint you a new ad picture, okay?

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
Okay.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
It's the jack-in-the-box man.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
And he's doing his fucking bullshit, right?

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
He's like dressed up as a fucking cowboy.

33:24.000 --> 33:33.000
He's advertising a new meal where you can get four tacos and a stank burger and a big old plate of spaghetti all for $1.

33:33.000 --> 33:37.000
And he's like doing his like funny bit and everybody's like having a good time laughing.

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
And who's that driving down the street in a big stretch limo?

33:40.000 --> 33:47.000
Well, the back window rolls down and you see just like a sweaty Ron and he's not wearing a shirt.

33:47.000 --> 33:52.000
And he just looks at the jack-in-the-box man kind of condescendingly.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
And you can tell that he's like making love in there.

33:55.000 --> 34:00.000
And then like the window rolls up and he drives up and then it's ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
He's doing it.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
And it's not a jack-in-the-box commercial anymore.

34:04.000 --> 34:09.000
So McDonald's buys a commercial app from underneath them.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
Yes.

34:10.000 --> 34:15.000
Or another one could be the fucking creepy Burger King King is like peering through a window.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
And who's in that window?

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
It's a mid-coitus Ron.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
And you don't see him.

34:21.000 --> 34:28.000
You never see him but you hear sort of some squeaking and some low moaning.

34:28.000 --> 34:34.000
I think a good way to keep this campaign moving because I don't want the campaign to stall.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
It's so important to reinvent.

34:36.000 --> 34:40.000
I think you've seen all the classic ads sort of run out.

34:40.000 --> 34:46.000
Even like ones people love like where's the beef or whatever.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
They run out of steam eventually.

34:48.000 --> 34:54.000
Bo knows that you know I could name other ads but I feel like we keep the campaign moving forward

34:54.000 --> 35:00.000
where each ad Ronald discovers a new sex thing.

35:00.000 --> 35:04.000
So he's like more it's like ba-da-bum-bum-bum.

35:04.000 --> 35:09.000
There's more holes and he's like excited that he's excited he found other holes.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
And then he's like ba-da-bum-bum-bum.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
Not just women.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
You can do it with guys too.

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
You could do it with basically anybody that's willing.

35:19.000 --> 35:24.000
And like in every commercial he finds a new sex thing that he's excited about.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
And then the last commercial he has to learn to love himself.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Exactly.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
By which I mean masturbation.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
I could have just been doing this the whole time.

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
I could have done this the whole time.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
All right.

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
So that and that was that one.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
That was that.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
That was that bit.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
That bit is that.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
That was what you heard earlier was the end of it.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
That was the end of it.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
This is after it.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
This is after it.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
And I hope you all.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Another classic bit in the books.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
That but we're done.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
We're done.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
Come on.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
Let's go.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
Come on get in the car.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
We're going.

36:02.000 --> 36:13.000
I'm going to tell you about nature box.

36:13.000 --> 36:18.000
Nature box is the best place to go to get snacks that taste great and are better for you.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
Made with high quality ingredients that are free from artificial colors flavors or sweeteners.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
So you can feel great about snacking.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
They have a ton of really great snacks.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
I have a few bags on hand right now.

36:27.000 --> 36:31.000
Got some dark chocolate almonds that are really good.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
Got some salt and pepper pop pops.

36:34.000 --> 36:38.000
I've got some raspberry whole wheat figgy bars.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
I've got some big island pineapple.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Really into the big island pineapple.

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
It's just like dried pineapple rings but they're good as hell.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
If fruit roll ups were good it could be big island pineapple.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
It's really simple.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
A shot fired across the bow of fruit roll ups.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
We're just rolling out sponsors left and right huh?

36:57.000 --> 37:01.000

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000

I would like to talk to everybody about their underpinnings.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
It's underwear.

37:29.000 --> 37:35.000
What's on your frame?

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Really informs.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
No it's not a question.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
It's the rest of the sentence.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
Really informs I would say the rest of your day.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
You know what I mean?

37:46.000 --> 37:52.000
I don't know if you're like me but you wake up in the morning and you kind of look through your walk in closet of underwear.

37:52.000 --> 37:56.000
And you decide what kind of day you're going to have.

37:56.000 --> 38:00.000
Are you going to wear your favorite pair?

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Are you going to wear your least favorite pair?

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Are you going to wear your productive underpants?

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Are you going to wear your comfortable underpants?

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Are you going to wear your chain mail underpants?

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Are you going to wear your lead lined underpants?

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
You really have to decide.

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
It's laundry day so I'm wearing some non-mundies.

38:16.000 --> 38:21.000
And it's a pair of boxers that are like a size too big for me.

38:21.000 --> 38:26.000
And to quote the classic song Huge Basketball Shorts, it's like a Bedouin group tent cinched by a belt.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
It's no good down there.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
And it's ruining this podcast.

38:30.000 --> 38:35.000
So we would like you to really get your undercarriage game on point.

38:35.000 --> 38:43.000
Much like Justin might modify the undercarriage of his new whip, you can modify your undercarriage with me undies.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
And you know what?

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Here's the super fun.

38:46.000 --> 38:54.000
And you know, it's a little bit cheesy but I think it's nice that you can do matching underpants for you and your partner.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Or partners.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
You know what I mean?

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
Go to town.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Matching the undercarriage of me undies.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
That would be fun, wouldn't it?

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
For your business partners.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
For your business partners?

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
For your band partners?

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
That might be the thing that brings you up.

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
Maybe you're like, you know how the Red Hot Chili Peppers always perform with their dicks out?

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Oh yeah, I love that.

39:14.000 --> 39:20.000
Because that's what I want to see is a bunch of like 50 year old dudes hanging brain at the Super Bowl.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
Right?

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Thanks Chili Peps.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
So maybe your band thing is you all playing matching me undies.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
Right?

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
Now I know what you're thinking.

39:28.000 --> 39:33.000
But Travis, I am in the polyphonic spree and that would cost way too much.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
Okay.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Well first of all, thank you for listening.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
I think that's a bold claim, but I'm not making it.

40:20.000 --> 40:24.000
I guarantee 2017 is the year that if you haven't girded your loins with me undies,

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
you're just not doing it right.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Meundies.com slash my brother.

40:28.000 --> 40:32.000
I have a message here for Jacqueline and it's from Misty who says,

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Happy birthday to my favorite older sister.

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
You did a great job this past year and I'm sure this next year will be even better.

40:38.000 --> 40:43.000
You're still an awesome sister even if you're seeing Hamilton three times and only taking me once.

40:43.000 --> 40:47.000
You did introduce me to the brothers so I guess it's a fair trade.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
Happy birthday again from your sweet baby sister.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
And wow, that one's for January 13th.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
We did a good job with the timing on that.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
Yay.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
Good job.

40:58.000 --> 41:04.000
I love – you got to see Hamilton three times because that's when you really start to notice the ARG.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
Yeah.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Lynn is hitting – happy birthday Lynn by the way.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
Happy birthday Lynn.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
Happy birthday Lynn.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
Happy birthday.

41:10.000 --> 41:14.000
Have so many secret messages though and so many like a secret game and like a fun riddle.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
And there's like call outs that they want you to do.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
Yeah.

41:18.000 --> 41:24.000
Like you can actually – a lot of people don't know this but if you watch Hamilton and do the call outs at the right time,

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
you actually shift the story.

41:26.000 --> 41:30.000
They're like, oh we have a puzzle keeper in the audience.

41:30.000 --> 41:36.000
There's like an old wizard that is not normally by the show but he comes out and he's like, we have a puzzle keeper.

41:36.000 --> 41:40.000
And then the rest of the show just becomes about you trying to solve the – it's still very good.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
It's still good.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
The first time you just watch the show.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
The second time you look for the clues.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
The third time, the trick is you got to watch the audience to find out who the murderer is.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Find out who the murderer is.

41:49.000 --> 41:54.000
But then if you find out the right keyword, at the end of the show, Bird's got his gun pointed at Hamilton.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Hamilton points his pistol at this guy.

41:56.000 --> 42:00.000
And then you shout, we the people because that's the key code.

42:00.000 --> 42:04.000
Hamilton points his gun down, shoots Aaron Bird to death.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
And Hamilton lives.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
And Hamilton wins.

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
But then you get this good ending.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
Nobody's gotten the good ending yet.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
You've only gotten the bad ending.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
And also here's a little secret that they don't tell you when you buy your ticket.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
Reach under your chair.

42:18.000 --> 42:23.000
There's a little keypad in there and you can vote on which ending you want to see.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
Yeah.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
Look under your chair.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
You also get to vote on –

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
No farther. Reach farther.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
Farther.

42:28.000 --> 42:34.000
You get to vote on which family submission video is the funniest American home video.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
That's what they don't tell you.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
They don't tell you that.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
A lot of secret stuff.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
I have another message.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
Oh no.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
You can do it.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
Can I?

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
Do you mind?

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
This message is for Sarah and Ty.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
It's from Dad.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
It's from Mom.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
It's from Rachel.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
It's from Elliot.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
It's from Tim.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
And it's from Elizabeth.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Congratulations on your wedding.

42:53.000 --> 42:57.000
We hope your new life together is full of love, joy, and puppies.

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
Now let the brothers three –

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Say it.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
Weltern?

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
Weltum?

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
Weltum?

43:07.000 --> 43:11.000
Weltum you to married life with our theme song.

43:11.000 --> 43:18.000
We are the Coulter family and we are hospitable in every single little way possible.

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
We've got fire hazards in every room.

43:21.000 --> 43:29.000
Just make sure you're not here when it goes boom, tick, tick, boom, boom, boom.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
That's the theme song.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
That's a good theme song.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
Thanks.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
No, it's not.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
I'm not congratulating you.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
I'm congratulating this family.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
You can write it.

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
There is a lot of notation here.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
It's fully orchestrated and stuff.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
Yeah.

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
Congratulations, Sarah and Ty, rest of the family.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
Get the fuck together.

43:49.000 --> 43:53.000
Fire is serious business, y'all.

43:53.000 --> 43:58.000
Don't make us call somebody – like have a building inspector come in and shut you down.

43:58.000 --> 44:02.000
I'll call the fire police, the cop who's also a fireman.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
He's the most powerful.

44:04.000 --> 44:09.000
He's the most powerful because he has jurisdiction over both – over legal law and fire law,

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
so you better watch out and you better not cry.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
They let him use an ax and a gun.

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
He's got an ax and a gun, so you better watch out.

44:17.000 --> 44:20.000
Better say your prayers.

44:20.000 --> 44:27.000
When I was a kid, I used to see the fire inspector come by and I thought his job was to tell

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
if it was a fire or not.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Yeah, this was done by a fire.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
This one was a fire, guys.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
Back it up.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
Hi, brothers.

44:34.000 --> 44:39.000
My boyfriend today did this joke kiss thing where he leaned in with his mouth wide open

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
to put his mouth over the top of my mouth and also my nose.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
Oh my god.

44:43.000 --> 44:47.000
Instinctually, I tapped him pretty hard in the balls.

44:47.000 --> 44:51.000
I do not feel the punishment fits the crime and I'm wondering what kind of gift I should

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
get that says I'm sorry for balls tapping you.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
Any suggestions?

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
Thanks.

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
And that's from Sorry About Your Sandbags in Seattle.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
It's a funny thing about the ball tap.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
Yeah.

45:01.000 --> 45:09.000
Because if you don't have balls, when you see people get kicked in the nards, like Wolfman

45:09.000 --> 45:13.000
or whoever, get kicked in the nards, a lot of times you think, oh, that must be the most

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
painful thing.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
It's actually the tap is worse.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
The tap is worse.

45:17.000 --> 45:23.000
The worst ball pain, I think, is when you're wrapping up in an extension cord and you're

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
not taking great care.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
And you're not wearing pants.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
I hear a laugh of recognition.

45:29.000 --> 45:35.000
Everybody who has balls goes through this one, I think, sometimes.

45:35.000 --> 45:40.000
You wrap it up in an extension cord and it just gives that tap.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
It's nausea.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
It's rough.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
It's really rough.

45:43.000 --> 45:47.000
I was laughing because it would be funny if we just talked about different ways you could

45:47.000 --> 45:51.000
get hit in your gyms for the next 20 minutes.

45:51.000 --> 45:55.000
Maybe a bee lands on your crotch and someone's trying to be helpful.

45:55.000 --> 45:59.000
You get hit with a newspaper.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
It's very good.

46:00.000 --> 46:04.000
I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about nut shots because that ain't us.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
That just ain't us.

46:05.000 --> 46:09.000
I like to think we're a little bit better than this Ashton Kutcher form of humor.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
And we got at least 20 more episodes.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
We got to stretch it out a little bit.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
We got to stretch it out.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
We don't want to burn it out.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Stretching it out is another painful way.

46:16.000 --> 46:20.000
But I do want to say that I do actually think the punishment fit the crime because they

46:20.000 --> 46:24.000
tried to do baby CPR on you and that is unacceptable.

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
That's actually I think how the dementor's kiss works.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
Yes.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
You've got to be careful with that shit.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
You might have saved your life.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
You don't know.

46:32.000 --> 46:38.000
Maybe this whole boyfriend thing has just been a long con to eat your soul to commit you.

46:38.000 --> 46:42.000
I took a baby CPR class and you just put your whole mouth over basically their entire face

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
and it's like, ugh, really?

46:44.000 --> 46:48.000
Kiddo, I wouldn't like that basically at all.

46:48.000 --> 46:51.000
And I know it's a life-saving procedure but ugh, boy, their whole face.

46:51.000 --> 46:55.000
Yeah, the whole head basically just popping in your mouth like a jawbreaker and you breathe

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
real hard.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
Shit, that seems like it would stink but alright.

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
I can't imagine having that be done to me as a person.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
No thank you.

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
I think you're on solid ground here.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Yeah, no one should do that.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
He shouldn't have done that to you.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
And I mean like, he'll remember.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
Yeah.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
He's not going to try it again.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
Absolutely not.

47:16.000 --> 47:21.000
The three of you enter a cave of a big red dragon and is standing over a hoard of precious

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
golden rubies.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
And he says, what do you do adventures?

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
I'm a dragon man.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
I cast fire on him.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
It's very good.

47:28.000 --> 47:32.000
I address the red dragon and say, us, we're the hosts of the Adventure Zone, a podcast

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
about family playing Dungeons and Dragons.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
Very good synergy.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
Commit to the bit.

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
I roll to charm new listeners.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
It is very effective against all odds.

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
Everybody, we're the Macroids, we host the Adventure Zone, it's a podcast where we play

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
Dungeons and Dragons together.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
It's a comedy podcast.

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
We don't take the rules too seriously because there's a lot of them and we did not take

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
the time to learn them.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
Maybe listen to us.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
We come out every other Thursday on the Maximum Fun Network.

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
You can find us on iTunes or on MaximumFun.org.

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
I think this promo's a critical hit.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
I have a Yahoo real quick here I could do.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
Okay.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
It's from Altaba Answers user Drew Davenport.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
It's from Altaba's own Drew Davenport.

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
That's his new name, Altaba's Own.

48:19.000 --> 48:28.000
It's from Altaba user Hominy Dominy who asks, do you know some movie, cartoon, or book with

48:28.000 --> 48:31.000
same style of monkey bone?

48:31.000 --> 48:39.000
Maybe the nearest it that I know be The Mask or movies of Tim Burton and yet it's not exactly

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
that I quest.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
Okay.

48:42.000 --> 48:46.000
You know how sometimes those like fake news stories pop up at the bottom of other news

48:46.000 --> 48:52.000
stories and they say like, why no one will ever cast such and such in a movie again?

48:52.000 --> 48:56.000
I often see that for Brendan Fraser and I'm like, oh, I know why.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Oh no, I've got it.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
I like Brendan Fraser.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
I do too.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
I love Brendan Fraser.

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
But that's fool.

49:05.000 --> 49:10.000
Listen, we've talked about the nine lives of Brendan Fraser's career many times before,

49:10.000 --> 49:17.000
but like he in like one year made like the remake of Bedazzled, Monkeybone, and like

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
six other movies.

49:19.000 --> 49:23.000
Can we just talk quick pivot?

49:23.000 --> 49:28.000
I was listening to a recent Rosebuddies where your wife Rachel said she's never seen a

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
Brendan Fraser film.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
Yeah.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
What?

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
What?

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
Pretty wild.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
I didn't accidentally see a Brendan Fraser movie.

49:35.000 --> 49:40.000
I think she's, I think sometimes on that show she just like, she says stuff to sound more

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
erudite than I am.

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
Sure.

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
But you know she's seen George of the Jungle and loved it.

49:45.000 --> 49:49.000
She saw George of the Jungle and George of the Jungle too and loved both of them, even

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
though I don't think Brendan's in the second one.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
She's just so hungry for that Fraser content.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
One time she watched, oh, this is great.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
We were scrolling through Netflix and she's like, what's this show?

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
And I was like, Fraser?

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
And she was like, yeah, let's watch it.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
And she was like, where's Brendan the whole time?

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
And I was like, he's not in this one.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
He's not in that one.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
It's Kelsey in this one.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
How do you not at least see Encino Man?

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
I mean-

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
Yeah, we can't.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
Weaves in the Juice?

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
I know.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
Yeah.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
Love Brendan Fraser.

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
What the fuck were we talking about?

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Monkeybone, is there a show, it's like a recommendation.

50:18.000 --> 50:27.000
We can do like a Netflix recommendation, how you watch one documentary on how grains are

50:27.000 --> 50:33.000
harvested in Turkey or something like that and it's like, oh, here's a hundred more grain

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
movies.

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
Oh, I've got it.

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
I don't know.

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
I've got it, Griffin.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
I've got it.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
I've got it.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
You like Monkeybone.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
I love Monkeybone.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
I love Monkeybone.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
Must love Monkeybone.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Then you might like Cool World.

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
Cool World is very Monkeybone.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
Oh, man.

50:49.000 --> 50:52.000
Cool World on the SNES, love that.

50:52.000 --> 50:59.000
You control Jack, the character from Cool World and you're just like doing it.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Was Brad Pitt in Cool World?

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
Yeah, he was.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
Brad Pitt was Cool World.

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
Yeah, he was Cool World.

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
Whoa.

51:05.000 --> 51:13.000
I loved the Monkeybone game on the JNES and that console only had four games on it and

51:13.000 --> 51:23.180
it was Monkeybone, it was Gremlins 3, it was Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11.

51:23.180 --> 51:25.760
So they did make one, they released one more late game.

51:25.760 --> 51:29.120
I believe that was the Streetball version.

51:29.120 --> 51:34.200
Can everybody just give me 45 seconds?

51:34.200 --> 51:39.860
Cool World for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System has a Wikipedia page.

51:39.860 --> 51:44.600
The Wikipedia page will fill a single browser window, it is not extensive.

51:44.600 --> 51:49.660
The largest section is gameplay, it is broken into two paragraphs.

51:49.660 --> 51:52.600
Here is the full text of that section.

51:52.600 --> 51:56.980
The player controls Jack, who must avoid being surrounded by the pauper police, a cartoon

51:56.980 --> 51:59.400
police force, or get arrested.

51:59.400 --> 52:02.480
Depending on how many times the player has broken the law and whether he has collected

52:02.480 --> 52:08.600
the in-game currency of nickels, that's italicized, or not, the player will either get a lecture

52:08.600 --> 52:12.440
by Detective Frank Harris and or be forced to pay bail money.

52:12.440 --> 52:15.720
Ten coins is the usual bail required by Detective Harris.

52:15.720 --> 52:19.680
Players can visit Las Vegas to increase their nickel stash and store their coins at the

52:19.680 --> 52:21.400
Cool World bank.

52:21.400 --> 52:24.640
Other in-game, that's the first paragraph, other in-game locales include a pawn shop

52:24.640 --> 52:31.040
that allows items to be traded or bought with nickels, in addition to the stash slash club

52:31.040 --> 52:33.240
where the player arranges a date with Holly Wood.

52:33.240 --> 52:37.400
At Holly Wood's house, the player must navigate the exterior of the house in order to reach

52:37.400 --> 52:38.660
the date with Holly.

52:38.660 --> 52:41.880
If the player did not arrange a date with Holly before reaching the top, Jack is tossed

52:41.880 --> 52:43.320
back to the ground level.

52:43.320 --> 52:47.040
In the malt shop, candy can be found, in addition to other sweets.

52:47.040 --> 52:52.080
However, entry is restricted to players who have collected several pieces of candy.

52:52.080 --> 52:54.080
End of gameplay description.

52:54.080 --> 52:55.080
That's a good one.

52:55.080 --> 52:56.080
Gotta watch out.

52:56.080 --> 52:58.720
Gotta get my hands on this card.

52:58.720 --> 53:02.640
Now Nintendo Power did give that bad boy 3.25 out of 5.

53:02.640 --> 53:05.720
Power Unlimited went with 75% rating in their July 1993 issue.

53:05.720 --> 53:08.240
You know, three quarters of it's pretty good.

53:08.240 --> 53:11.840
There's a- I didn't like the malt level with the candy, but other than that-

53:11.840 --> 53:16.080
I love the pawn shop though, and the very graphic sex scene with Holly Wood.

53:16.080 --> 53:21.800
The graphics in the pawn shop and the sex scene were- the graphics were amazing.

53:21.800 --> 53:27.720
This is three fourths of the way to the greatest game you could possibly make, basically.

53:27.720 --> 53:32.200
I look at- I look at this, I look at Link to the Past and I say like, this is only 25%

53:32.200 --> 53:34.200
worse than this.

53:34.200 --> 53:37.240
Cool world, man.

53:37.240 --> 53:38.240
What a trip.

53:38.240 --> 53:40.440
That's a good recommendation for this.

53:40.440 --> 53:43.320
Didn't get Brad Pitt on the box though.

53:43.320 --> 53:49.800
Did not get Brad Pitt- there's a- there's a cartoon Kim Basinger, but not Brad Pitt.

53:49.800 --> 53:50.800
Didn't get the license.

53:50.800 --> 53:55.200
That's probably one of those Tom Cruise situations where like, he won't allow his spirit to be

53:55.200 --> 53:58.440
sucked up in a video game cartridge.

53:58.440 --> 53:59.780
I have a recommendation.

53:59.780 --> 54:05.160
If you like Monkeybone, you will love Seabiscuit.

54:05.160 --> 54:06.560
Now why is that?

54:06.560 --> 54:07.560
Okay.

54:07.560 --> 54:17.820
Well, Chris Kattan is in it, and he plays- he plays Monkeybone, and he's a rival jockey,

54:17.820 --> 54:19.660
but he's like, up to no good.

54:19.660 --> 54:22.200
So it's an unofficial non-canonical sequel?

54:22.200 --> 54:23.560
Is that what you're saying?

54:23.560 --> 54:25.760
It's canon- it is canonical.

54:25.760 --> 54:31.280
Seabiscuit's in the Boneverse, baby, and a lot of movies are and you don't realize it.

54:31.280 --> 54:34.320
Hamilton's technically in the Monkeyboneverse.

54:34.320 --> 54:36.280
Just nobody knows it because it's in the good ending.

54:36.280 --> 54:37.280
Here's a question.

54:37.280 --> 54:40.720
I have a problem where I can't throw away any stuffed animals or put them in my closet

54:40.720 --> 54:42.600
because I don't want to hurt their feelings.

54:42.600 --> 54:44.040
Fuck you, Toy Story.

54:44.040 --> 54:48.000
The real issue is that whenever people come over, they see my stuffed animals, assume

54:48.000 --> 54:50.640
I collect them, and then get me more as gifts.

54:50.640 --> 54:52.080
Ooh, that's rough.

54:52.080 --> 54:56.200
It's nice of them, but I am 20 years old, and I have about 50 stuffed animals now, and

54:56.200 --> 54:57.920
I'm running out of room on my bed.

54:57.920 --> 55:01.840
How do you politely tell people to stop getting me stuffed animals?

55:01.840 --> 55:06.400
That's from Entombed in East Lansing.

55:06.400 --> 55:09.960
You don't see that part of Toy Story, where Andy's just like crushed by the emotional

55:09.960 --> 55:14.480
weight of having all these toys, and his mom's like, look, I got you a new year, it's Dash

55:14.480 --> 55:15.480
Rendar.

55:15.480 --> 55:22.640
He's like, fucking another toy that I can't, ugh, hello Dash, hi, I'm Dash Rendar, point

55:22.640 --> 55:28.960
me which way to Boba Femme, kick his ass, okay, well, Dave, don't let me die or get

55:28.960 --> 55:29.960
rid of me.

55:29.960 --> 55:35.120
Okay, god, it's like I have 40 kids, this sucks, I hate my toys.

55:35.120 --> 55:39.800
I'm a Star Wars character without any superpowers or laser swords, I'm everybody's favorite.

55:39.800 --> 55:42.880
I don't have a cool motorcycle thing.

55:42.880 --> 55:43.960
I'm nothing.

55:43.960 --> 55:47.320
If you carry me out on the street and let me go and I fall into a drain, it's like you've

55:47.320 --> 55:48.840
murdered a real person.

55:48.840 --> 55:49.840
All right, Dash, fuck.

55:49.840 --> 55:53.280
Do you just want to stay in my room, I guess?

55:53.280 --> 55:58.080
Yeah, but don't let the cat get me, it'll actually kill me like it's killed a real person.

55:58.080 --> 56:01.680
The problem is, if you get rid of some of your stuffed animals, people will come by

56:01.680 --> 56:03.760
and say, mm, supplies look a little low.

56:03.760 --> 56:06.160
Let me run through them real quick.

56:06.160 --> 56:10.400
Let me top you off with a few more stuffed animals.

56:10.400 --> 56:14.640
This is Susan the rabbit and she has to take these pills twice a day.

56:14.640 --> 56:17.760
Okay, just more responsibility.

56:17.760 --> 56:21.360
You don't need all this responsibility on your shoulders at 20 years old.

56:21.360 --> 56:28.000
I think you need to divest, or maybe come up with a fictional sort of plague that sweeps

56:28.000 --> 56:29.760
through, you know what I mean?

56:29.760 --> 56:35.160
That's a dark way to take it, but if you're worried about offending the spirits or whatever

56:35.160 --> 56:41.760
of these stuffed animals, maybe some of them, I don't know, died and then you can get rid

56:41.760 --> 56:42.760
of them.

56:42.760 --> 56:46.360
I know that's a dark way to take this, but it solves the problem pretty well.

56:46.360 --> 56:52.840
Well, there's a lighter way to go with this and the answer is in the question.

56:52.840 --> 56:59.440
You're stuck in Toy Story 1, you gotta get to Toy Story 3 and give these to a child who

56:59.440 --> 57:04.960
will appreciate having 100 stuffed animals all over their bed, you know what I mean?

57:04.960 --> 57:06.360
It's their problem now.

57:06.360 --> 57:11.840
You need to put away such childish things and start a new journey for, you know, Mr.

57:11.840 --> 57:16.160
Bear McGuggins and give them to a neighborhood child.

57:16.160 --> 57:19.600
Don't do a Toy Story 2 though and give one of them to a weird pervert because then you

57:19.600 --> 57:24.800
actually end up with more toys at the end of the movie.

57:24.800 --> 57:28.080
It's a net toy gain.

57:28.080 --> 57:32.040
I suggest, you know people do Christmas cards.

57:32.040 --> 57:36.440
I would like to suggest a new kind of card that you can send out to everybody.

57:36.440 --> 57:39.160
People use Christmas cards to update people with their life scenario or whatever.

57:39.160 --> 57:43.880
I want to suggest a new kind of card called I'm out the game cards and basically here's

57:43.880 --> 57:44.880
what this would be.

57:44.880 --> 57:48.960
It would be a picture of you with all your stuffed animals and at the top it would say

57:48.960 --> 57:54.840
in huge letters, I'm out the game and on the inside it would say, see all these motherfuckers?

57:54.840 --> 57:56.300
They're headed to the dumpster.

57:56.300 --> 58:01.220
This chapter of my life is over and everybody needs to be made aware of that, but you don't,

58:01.220 --> 58:02.960
you don't do anything.

58:02.960 --> 58:05.320
You don't get rid of them.

58:05.320 --> 58:09.880
You keep them and if people come by just be like, yeah I haven't made it to the dumpster

58:09.880 --> 58:11.720
yet but soon I'm gonna get there.

58:11.720 --> 58:14.840
But then everybody will know that you're out of the game and they won't get you any more

58:14.840 --> 58:17.200
stuffed animals and you can do this with anything.

58:17.200 --> 58:22.760
Any hobby that you're over, like if nine-year-old Griffin could have said to everybody, I'm

58:22.760 --> 58:28.200
out the game regarding NASCAR, which he had a brief flirtation with, the reverberations

58:28.200 --> 58:29.200
echoed.

58:29.200 --> 58:31.760
I teased with it.

58:31.760 --> 58:35.720
And you didn't quite, didn't quite shake it for a while.

58:35.720 --> 58:41.380
I got a NASCAR, I got a fucking NASCAR like fat head that I had hung up on the wall of

58:41.380 --> 58:45.720
my room for like a minute and I was like, what am I doing?

58:45.720 --> 58:46.720
This isn't me.

58:46.720 --> 58:51.680
But he knew he was out the game but other people didn't know that he was out of the

58:51.680 --> 58:52.680
game.

58:52.680 --> 58:57.600
So I'm saying we need to make it a custom that you make, you make a broad sweeping announcement

58:57.600 --> 59:00.880
that everybody should be aware that you're out of a particular game, that you're no longer

59:00.880 --> 59:01.880
in the game.

59:01.880 --> 59:06.760
Uh, but then like what if they've already bought me, you know, the Joey Logano fat head

59:06.760 --> 59:12.600
to hang up alongside the, the, the DJ 3 fat head.

59:12.600 --> 59:13.600
You throw it in the trash.

59:13.600 --> 59:14.600
DJ?

59:14.600 --> 59:15.600
Who's DJ?

59:15.600 --> 59:20.340
Cause it's, it would definitely be DE would be Dale Earnhardt and he's definitely junior,

59:20.340 --> 59:21.340
not the third.

59:21.340 --> 59:25.040
So I kind of, I, I, man, ha ha, racing, right?

59:25.040 --> 59:27.160
Like there's so many racers it's hard to keep them all straight.

59:27.160 --> 59:28.360
I think it's racist.

59:28.360 --> 59:33.800
If you're following toys, if you're following toy story rules, um, then if you have your

59:33.800 --> 59:39.520
stuffed animals somewhere where you can see them easily that you're robbing life seconds

59:39.520 --> 59:43.760
from them, honestly, because they can't live their lives as long as you can see them.

59:43.760 --> 59:47.780
So the kindest thing you could do for them is put them in an attic where they can build

59:47.780 --> 59:52.920
a new society free from your tyrannical rule and they can live forever up there and they

59:52.920 --> 59:57.760
never have to shut off their spirits and you can live your life downstairs and everybody

59:57.760 --> 59:59.600
can just go back to business.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:00.600
That's what I would do.

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:01.720
That's the toy floor.

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:02.720
We don't go up there.

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:03.720
They have their life.

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:04.720
We have ours.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.200
If we go up there, we kill them.

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:07.200
So we have to stay here.

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.200
When you see them, they're dead.

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:15.880
So you would think there would be one scene in toy story of like a toy, like sneezing

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.840
and everybody being like, what, right?

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:21.600
Like the toy sneezes when it's in dead mode.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:25.880
Yeah, because they're just pretending to be toys.

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:26.880
Yeah.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:27.880
Yeah.

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:28.880
I mean, definitely.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:33.960
What's the toy movie that's sort of like the Christmas toy?

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:34.960
Christmas, right.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:35.960
You guys read that one?

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:36.960
Yeah.

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:41.680
That's kind of like it follows toy story law sort of, but if you get spotted, you're dead.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:42.680
Yeah.

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:43.680
That's cool.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:44.680
But you're still a toy.

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:45.680
That's the thing.

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:51.240
Just your anima, your soul is ripped from your toy body and you are then, and the worst

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:55.440
part about that is, is like, and not to jump into the old internet, you know, toy story.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.440
What if they die?

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:59.160
But like, then that toy's still there.

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:02.840
It's not like the human picks up and goes, nah, soul's out of it, better get rid of this

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:03.840
one.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:04.840
This one's got a soul.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:08.880
Got a soul dumpster.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:12.200
So this has been my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:14.360
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:16.080
Sorry about killing all those toys at the end.

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:17.980
I think it's got a little dark.

01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:22.680
And sorry about what else, the Ronald sex thing was like out of line.

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:24.120
Really sorry about that.

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:28.720
Even bringing that awful Brendan Fraser movie to my like attention, you manifested it into

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:31.600
my universe and I don't know if I can forgive you for that.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:32.600
That's a nightmare.

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.160
That maybe should be wiped from existence.

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:37.900
So sorry about all that stuff, but we hope you've managed to enjoy yourself somehow against

01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:38.900
all odds.

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:43.160
Is there anything cooking that we want to tell people about, anything in the hopper?

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:50.000
I would like to do a little plug for a new project that I am starting this week.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.760
So me and Hal Lublin, who is, you know, another host of General Podcasts and a good friend

01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:01.320
of mine, we're starting a podcast called Surprisingly Nice, where we sit down with

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:08.320
people that we are both friends and fans of and just have a super pleasant conversation.

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:13.240
We just recorded our first episode with Adam Savage and topics of discussion included,

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:16.260
what's your favorite kind of weather and why?

01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:20.640
What's your favorite smell that you would never find as a Yankee Candle?

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:25.320
When you have ice cream, do you eat it right away or let it melt a little?

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.000
And it's very nice.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:35.600
And the kind of hook of it is each episode, there will be a 45 minute version made available

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:42.840
for free to everybody, and there will also be an extended version on Bandcamp for a dollar.

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:48.240
And all money from those sales goes to a charity of the guests choosing.

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:52.600
So in episode one, Adam Savage chose the Standing Rock Tribe.

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:57.400
So all money from the sale of those episodes will go to Standing Rock.

01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:02.440
So if you want to check that out, all the free episodes will be on iTunes and we'll

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:03.680
also tweet out the link.

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:07.240
The Twitter is The Nice Cast.

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:14.560
And you can also find the extended versions on Bandcamp at bit.ly forward slash surprisingly

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:15.560
nice.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.600
Our monikers expansion came out.

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:23.540
And so if you bought one of those, then you should have it or have it very soon.

01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:27.800
If you didn't, I don't think there's, is there going to be a way to get it after this?

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:34.400
I think we warned people fairly well that it was a one time dealie.

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:36.160
So yeah, I hope you all enjoy it.

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:37.880
I'm really happy with how it turned out.

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:45.280
It's cool that we have like a card game thing that like has all our dumb jokes on it.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:49.000
And thank you to the monikers folks for doing that with us.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.760
It was a lot of fun.

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:56.240
Our CISO show is coming out soon, in like a month, and that's going to be really good

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.240
too.

01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:01.760
There's going to be more stuff about it coming out soon, more video stuff that I think y'all

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:02.760
are going to like.

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:06.920
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the Use of Our Theme Song Instead of Parture

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:09.040
off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:12.640
It's a very, very, very good album to listen to during this long winter.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.160
Also want to thank Maximum Fun for having us.

Yeah, so I have a final yahoo here and it's sent in by, wow, what's wrong?

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:45.680
Yeah.

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:49.360
It's just like Justin suddenly forgot how he ended every episode of the show.

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:50.360
Yeah.

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:51.360
Sorry, I'm still getting over this call.

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.360
I don't feel great.

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:53.360
I'm just trying my best.

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:56.360
Don't say that you didn't like this episode because I was trying my best.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:57.680
Who's trying his best, everybody?

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:01.400
I'm trying my best, believe it or not.

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:07.400
This one was sent in by, man, a lot of people sent in some really good ones this week, but

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:11.880
this closer was sent in by Level 9000 Altaba user Drew Davenport.

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:14.200
Sorry, is that the hat trick?

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.200
Yeah.

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:16.200
Damn.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:17.920
Thank you, Drew.

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:26.320
It's from Altaba answers user Brian who asks, what hookah tobacco smells like sex or a sexy

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.320
woman?
