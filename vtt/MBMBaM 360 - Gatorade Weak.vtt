The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.880
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern

00:48.880 --> 00:53.840
era. I'm your oldest brother Justin Tyler McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis P. McElroy.

00:53.840 --> 00:58.000
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary Griffin McElroy A.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.560
A is my middle. A is my middle initial. Turn around every now and then I get a little bit

01:04.560 --> 01:16.800
nervous. My Brother, My Brother and Me 360. We've done it. We're all the way back at the start.

01:16.800 --> 01:26.480
So it's like a geometry joke. Okay, so we've circled back around or like a fully immersive

01:26.480 --> 01:34.720
interactive experience. Well, it's both Travis. We're back to the beginning, which means

01:36.480 --> 01:41.360
just a lot. We're just going to use challenging terminology for everybody that isn't a straight

01:41.360 --> 01:49.680
white dude. What's the audio quality going to be like, you ask? Oh, it will be unlistenable.

01:49.680 --> 01:55.920
It's gonna be hard. Yeah, it'll be hard to recreate that. I'm gonna go put my expensive

01:55.920 --> 02:00.800
mic sort of dip it in a toilet for a bit and then continue using it. I should recreate sort

02:00.800 --> 02:06.800
of the original WAV files I was producing. Back at the beginning as if we never left My Brother,

02:06.800 --> 02:11.280
My Brother and Me the beginning. What was that? Hey, here's a trivia question for you.

02:11.840 --> 02:16.480
What was the first question ever on My Brother, My Brother and Me?

02:16.480 --> 02:23.840
Was it shampoo and a shower? Yeah, maybe. You don't know. You shouldn't have asked it if you

02:23.840 --> 02:30.000
didn't know it. I shouldn't have asked it if I didn't know it. I completely agree. Now Justin,

02:30.000 --> 02:35.040
where does the 360 immersive like fully VR experience? That's what I want to know about.

02:35.040 --> 02:42.400
Can I plug this into my fucking Google cardboard that came with my New Yorker magazine and be in

02:42.400 --> 02:48.400
it be in the room be in the studio turn to my left see the big big box of sickness tissues I've

02:48.400 --> 02:52.800
got going look to my right and see the I've got a roll of toilet paper over here just in case I run

02:52.800 --> 02:56.880
out of sickness issues. Can people experience this at real time in their Google cardboard?

02:58.560 --> 03:05.840
That's the plan. We're still the tech is still sort of in its in a nebulous infancy. We've got

03:05.840 --> 03:11.680
until tomorrow to figure it out because we're recording on Sunday. So getting the 360 experience

03:11.680 --> 03:17.040
I think is obviously the biggest challenge we're facing currently. Well maybe we can maybe we can

03:17.040 --> 03:23.200
like audio it a little bit and I can say like well right now to my right I'm recording on my desktop

03:23.200 --> 03:30.560
but to my left I'm shopping on Amazon for Father's Day presents for myself and I'm eyeballing the

03:30.560 --> 03:36.160
portable air conditioner I had to turn off so as not to actually make it sound like our first 10

03:36.160 --> 03:42.400
episodes right yeah and every second that takes by makes me sweat more and more it was the air

03:42.400 --> 03:48.640
conditioner saying all the problematic stuff yeah that air conditioner oh boy I've got the AC and

03:48.640 --> 03:56.640
definitely not PC yeah I've got the first question you ready yeah my brother my brother comes to us

03:56.640 --> 04:03.440
from the potato the underscore potato on Twitter god that sounds bad yes I want a larger follower

04:03.440 --> 04:08.640
account but I'm finding it difficult to get more than two in a day this was our can I do start a

04:08.640 --> 04:14.320
bunch of accounts and have them follow each other oh that was a good one good job good job question

04:16.160 --> 04:22.480
fucking social media like acumen that was really what we fucking kicked it off with hey listen we

04:22.480 --> 04:29.280
did okay I mean like you can't you I do I did have a lot fewer followers than I do now so something

04:29.280 --> 04:38.000
here is probably pretty good um what are you all boys doing for dad's day I'm gonna play um a lot

04:38.000 --> 04:45.680
of computer games and for one brief hour pretend like my life now isn't at the whim of my seven

04:45.680 --> 04:50.720
month old daughter and that I can actually make decisions for myself I'm trying to get to that

04:50.720 --> 04:57.440
captain underpants oh yes I'm trying to get over there another dreamworks franchise I want to

04:57.440 --> 05:03.120
celebrate the entire sort of company output um I gotta get over there I tried to get over try to

05:03.120 --> 05:08.240
get over there and my excitement I had two big buckets of popcorn two big puppets and you know

05:08.240 --> 05:11.680
I kicked the door open into the theater and they asked me to leave right there and then so maybe

05:11.680 --> 05:17.520
I'll try again a little more subdued contain a little bit contain it who's your do you guys want

05:17.520 --> 05:22.560
to talk about a dad that's important to you not our dad obviously because it's the easy one but

05:22.560 --> 05:28.960
a dad that's important to you like in media or like in real life like my friend steve's dad or

05:28.960 --> 05:34.000
something I mean if whatever you want to do a dad's important to you it's the only sort of but

05:34.000 --> 05:39.280
not our dad no no no I mean our dad's the most important dad he's a great dad and a very special

05:39.280 --> 05:43.760
father but I feel like we talk about him and his funny injuries every father's day like it's time

05:43.760 --> 05:48.240
to cut his butt open use a maxi pad it's a big bandage you know basic stories like that still

05:48.240 --> 05:54.000
be on those phones though there's still me well no not on his butt bones because the the I believe

05:54.000 --> 05:59.200
it was a window screen cut him wide open butt fell right off so dad that's important to us now

05:59.200 --> 06:03.600
on our dad who poured kitty litter and bleached down a drain and knocked himself out for several

06:03.600 --> 06:06.640
hours right right right right right right it's convenient about the it's convenient about the

06:06.640 --> 06:11.600
butt thing he puts his wallet in that side of his pants he sits normal now it all bounces out

06:11.600 --> 06:17.120
because some of the butt fell out when he cut himself right right that was yes I'll start I

06:17.120 --> 06:29.280
guess dave hester from storage wars we get to see some of that relationship unfold and entangle on

06:29.280 --> 06:38.880
the show with dave jr and I don't know I mean not a traditional great dad I guess um but he has he

06:38.880 --> 06:44.560
has a catchphrase and everybody loves that for a good dad and you know passes on business acumen

06:44.560 --> 06:50.640
passes on the family business at all times I am I am I am fucking rolling on that suda

06:50.640 --> 06:56.640
so fucking hard I'm on that suda 51 so hard that like I'm being hypnotized watching my own

06:56.640 --> 07:01.760
waveforms appear on the screen in front of me it's gonna be a fun record I want to talk about Dave

07:01.760 --> 07:09.840
Thomas okay wait which founder founder of Wendy's America's dad uh here's some cool he wants to

07:09.840 --> 07:17.840
know some cool fucking things about Dave Thomas oh yeah uh he was he was adopted he started a

07:17.840 --> 07:25.840
foundation for adoption um he worked at Kentucky Fried Chicken and the colonel tried to lure him

07:26.640 --> 07:35.440
into um a tryst a big pan a big pit full hamburgers and he was like you know me too well

07:35.440 --> 07:43.840
colonel no he was he was uh uh he he listen he founded Wendy's this is huge agreed found

07:43.840 --> 07:50.640
a Wendy's in Columbus Ohio go to the first Wendy's I think it's closed now but um found the

07:50.640 --> 07:58.240
first Wendy's extremely successful but didn't graduate from college right get this he quit high

07:58.240 --> 08:05.040
school uh in fact he didn't even finish high school but he found just a rose that keeps blooming

08:05.040 --> 08:12.560
I know but get this you ready yeah he was so successful after dropping out of high school

08:12.560 --> 08:18.320
he was worried that people would use him as an example for why you shouldn't finish high school

08:18.320 --> 08:25.280
so he went back to high school in like yeah in 1993 he went to coconut creek high school

08:25.280 --> 08:31.200
after founding Wendy's this motherfucker went back to high school it's great got his GED it's amazing

08:31.200 --> 08:37.040
let me pop right in can I get can I pop into the cut real quick whatever you got is it about how

08:37.040 --> 08:44.080
he how he didn't wait for the draft of the Korean War he volunteered for the army well that yeah

08:44.080 --> 08:50.800
now did he have kid did he have a kid did he have children he had four children okay

08:51.600 --> 08:55.200
I just want to pop in I just want to pop in there because we are talking about great dads

08:55.200 --> 08:59.200
and he's America's dad he's the father of the Wendy's franchise and he's father

08:59.200 --> 09:04.640
of of he's like a a surrogate father to kids that want to quit high school yeah and then find out

09:04.640 --> 09:09.280
that um and here's just another factoid this isn't really related but he made a cameo appearance as

09:09.280 --> 09:14.160
himself in bionic ever after a reunion tv movie based on the six million dollar man and the bionic

09:14.160 --> 09:20.000
woman so that's kind of a cool thing about Dave Thomas and that would be I do not have any context

09:20.000 --> 09:25.280
for that scene but I'm assuming it's a pretty cool scene yeah if for some reason Dave Thomas shows

09:25.280 --> 09:30.720
up as himself I cannot fathom what happens in that scene but I'm very excited that it exists

09:30.720 --> 09:37.840
do we know anything about Dave Thomas's politics oh Jesus hold on um I mean he was rich so that

09:37.840 --> 09:42.560
probably didn't not great maybe but I don't know I don't know about his personal politics

09:42.560 --> 09:46.880
I'm not here to talk about Dave Thomas's politics I'm here to talk about how he went back to high

09:46.880 --> 09:52.880
school to inspire kids to finish school I think that's inspiring uh looks like he's pro-choice

09:52.880 --> 10:03.280
he's not anything he's passed away but the fine um so advice so this is an advice show and um

10:03.280 --> 10:08.080
we help people with the real issues that are going on in their lives back in the early days

10:08.080 --> 10:12.640
we used to do a lot of like benign shit you know what I mean because we were afraid to get our toes

10:12.640 --> 10:20.400
into some hot water um but with it's 360 so now we're back around to really um well soak in these

10:20.400 --> 10:27.600
toes soaking these toes in the hot water like race sex politics nothing's off limits because this is

10:27.600 --> 10:35.200
my brother my brother he 360 here's our first question how much cream cheese should I put

10:35.200 --> 10:42.240
on my bagel and that's from cream cheese confounded um and it's you know what

10:43.200 --> 10:48.400
it's a pretty good question yeah I guess so it differs from where you go to where you aren't

10:48.400 --> 10:52.000
it's because you go to an airport and you get a bagel at an airport and they give you

10:53.040 --> 10:59.920
a thimble a borrower full of cream cheese the littlest cup but you go to a new york deli hey

11:01.120 --> 11:06.080
they get fucking crazy it's like they've got a bunch of cream cheese and it's like

11:06.080 --> 11:11.680
brewster's million style they have to get rid of all of it in order to win the treasure or something

11:11.680 --> 11:17.760
here's the thing when it comes to cream I see four options with your cream cheese application

11:17.760 --> 11:23.360
hold on you faxed me over a chart here let me yeah listen I put a lot of thought all right

11:23.360 --> 11:29.200
I'm reviewing it option a you have your open face cream cheese on both sides of the bagel option

11:29.200 --> 11:35.920
right two different halves both of them cream cheesed option b you put cream cheese on one

11:35.920 --> 11:42.640
half you make a sandwich out of it option c cream cheese on both half sandwich out of it this is

11:42.640 --> 11:48.160
double cream cheese you're gonna dribble and it's gonna be you're gonna get a lot of like

11:48.160 --> 11:55.120
is that cum no it's not it's cream cheese I did it I got I flew too close to the to the bagel sun

11:55.120 --> 12:03.920
and option option four and this is my preferred option just a container whatever a big lump of

12:03.920 --> 12:09.120
cream cheese whatever a dollop of cream cheese however you prefer to measure it out and then

12:09.120 --> 12:15.440
you break off pieces of the bagel there we go scoop the cream cheese with it that is your

12:16.560 --> 12:22.480
cream cheese palette and you will dip your brush and then spread it into the canvas of your mouth

12:22.480 --> 12:28.160
correct I I think that cream cheese is actually a pretty good measure for where you're at as a

12:28.160 --> 12:35.360
grown-up oh when I was a little kid no cream cheese butter and jam for me please mother butter

12:35.360 --> 12:42.880
and jam and then maybe a scoop of clotted cream as I got a little older I had basically the thinnest

12:42.880 --> 12:48.560
possible layer of cream cheese and then as I got even older and I started to appreciate that gooey

12:48.560 --> 12:53.520
salty cheese I started thinking like I could take a little bit more of this I can handle some more

12:53.520 --> 12:58.640
and so I would be eating a bagel with a pretty substantial amount of cream cheese and then from

12:58.640 --> 13:03.760
out of nowhere some adult like a real grown-up would walk past me and be like you know some of

13:03.760 --> 13:08.000
us are putting locks on it and it's like I'll never get there I'm never gonna get to a point

13:08.000 --> 13:12.080
where like oh that's a good amount cream cheese maybe a fillet of brine salmon on top of that

13:12.080 --> 13:17.280
you know they're doing some capers on there too which are just I cannot fuck with capers in any

13:17.280 --> 13:22.000
way but like to think of a breakfast where I'm gonna put a fillet of brine salmon on my cream

13:22.000 --> 13:27.840
cheese no way it's unthinkable it's unthinkable it's unimaginable I'll fuck with some mocks though

13:27.840 --> 13:33.200
I don't know why I said it's oh I think about it a lot and capers are really just like olives that

13:33.200 --> 13:40.400
couldn't quite get there huh it is tiny salty just like little uh you know like pop rocks

13:40.400 --> 13:46.880
only for salt instead of sugar that's what caper is they're just weird sick peanuts yes if you

13:46.880 --> 13:57.120
really unpack it um I prefer Travis's method it's just like I have um some tooth problems bottom

13:57.120 --> 14:02.080
left my the whole bottom left quadrant of my mouth just doesn't behave I've gone to see the dentist

14:02.080 --> 14:06.720
dentist says it's all made up and I say it's he says you're just thinking too hard about it just

14:06.720 --> 14:11.840
to eat your eat your fucking food uh it's all goofed up and so every bite of food I take is is

14:11.840 --> 14:18.240
it's it's precious because it could be the last so I want to perfectly measure out each perfect bite

14:18.240 --> 14:24.240
every bite of bagel that I take is like a little amuse bouche and I just have a hundred of them

14:24.240 --> 14:29.280
and it's perfectly creamed and I'm good I'm good to go I'm ready to go anytime I have the opportunity

14:29.280 --> 14:34.880
to do that with my food I will chase it anytime I have the opportunity to have a sort of dunkaroo

14:34.880 --> 14:40.400
method I'm going I am going to chase that 100 percent of the time you touched on this Griffin

14:40.400 --> 14:46.800
but I would like to circle back around when I'm getting deli in New York like a New York like they

14:46.800 --> 14:59.600
say a bow bow hey what is what you know how they do it yeah what is with the the literal like down

14:59.600 --> 15:06.000
comforter of cream cheese that I have to like nosh through to get to the bagel inside what is

15:06.000 --> 15:11.440
going on over there it makes it makes me think that you're supposed to take some of it off and

15:11.440 --> 15:16.000
save it for later like it's like this is for tomorrow's we don't we don't know if you have

15:16.000 --> 15:20.480
cream cheese at home so this is for tomorrow's and possibly the day after that's bagels it's a three

15:20.480 --> 15:26.640
day cheese well what most people don't realize about the economy of New York City is the like

15:26.640 --> 15:31.760
the cost of living is very high like a beer is like twenty dollars and you know like rent is of

15:31.760 --> 15:35.520
course very high everybody knows that and it's like twenty dollars yeah right it's like twenty

15:35.520 --> 15:40.960
dollars and the sandwich is like twenty dollars and the balance is that cream cheese super cheap

15:40.960 --> 15:46.720
like yeah one cent a pound so like that's how they keep like that's how New York is able if

15:46.720 --> 15:51.200
you took cream cheese out of the equation everything will become so imbalanced in New

15:51.200 --> 15:55.440
York City that it would literally sink hit me with this hit me with this it's a city on the go

15:56.080 --> 15:59.120
city on the go city on the move everybody's always always moving and going from business

15:59.120 --> 16:02.400
meeting to business never sleeps never never sleeps getting a cab go from one business

16:02.400 --> 16:05.600
being the fucking next business meeting you've been home to check on your kids or your dog or

16:05.600 --> 16:10.160
whatever and forever they're gone they're gone they're gone they're gone they're on the go too

16:10.160 --> 16:14.160
they went to upstate New York they're out give me a cup give me a cup of mine you see baby stay out

16:14.160 --> 16:19.840
this baby stay out that's all it is so listen how come New York's food is like universally

16:19.840 --> 16:24.560
a big sloppy mess you can go and get a big wet slice of za and it's gonna dribble and drizzle

16:24.560 --> 16:29.840
all over you get a pound of cream cheese between two round boys and that's gonna get all over you

16:29.840 --> 16:35.200
you eat a big the coney dogs coney dogs don't get me started there's two different types of dribbling

16:35.200 --> 16:39.280
and drizzling that you can do all over yourself what is it you're on the go and you're on the

16:39.280 --> 16:43.440
move and everybody's just fucking sticky and and and wet and covered in condiments all the time

16:43.440 --> 16:48.640
what's up New York that's why that's why Griffin they need it as an excuse to stop like that's how

16:48.640 --> 16:53.200
you know your day is done in New York it's like well I'm caked in ketchup and cream cheese and

16:53.200 --> 16:57.760
syrup and whatever so now it's time now it's time to take a breathe you've been out on the

16:57.760 --> 17:02.400
big streets making mud pies and mom's calling you in for the day exactly you've had enough

17:02.400 --> 17:08.240
maybe though let me hit you with this maybe that is you ever heard the term tourist trap

17:08.240 --> 17:14.000
maybe it's pretty literal in this sense like oh you ate the food well you're stuck and I can just

17:14.000 --> 17:19.440
zip right on past you hey no problem New York more like no fork because they don't use they

17:19.440 --> 17:24.960
don't even use utensils for these big messy foods no fork city do you guys want a yahoo

inside you know it's juicy and it's been sitting up there long enough that it's also like really

17:44.160 --> 17:50.720
soft so you're gonna bite it and the texture's not gonna be right sorry trap sorry uh stop the

17:50.720 --> 17:55.280
podcast uh it's been up there where do you think the apple is it's on top of the empire state

17:55.280 --> 18:01.200
building that's why king kong climbed up there to get the tracks yeah he needed that apple

18:01.200 --> 18:08.080
it was worth it was worth a thousand bonus points that's fine fine did you not think

18:08.080 --> 18:15.760
I'd have an answer for that Justin oh of course of course uh Kevin Zach asks more like Big Snapple

18:15.760 --> 18:22.000
it's been a while oh it's been a while I'm glad it's back oh um wow this website's not good

18:23.760 --> 18:28.960
Kevin Kevin Zach the man so nice they named him twice asked how do we make apple juice more

18:28.960 --> 18:33.520
relevant to adult consumers our company's been pressing apples and making apple juice for

18:33.520 --> 18:37.760
generations all of the apple juice we make is Griffin I'm gonna stop you I'm gonna stop you

18:39.120 --> 18:46.080
I think you're tripped out on Sudafed we did do this question last week did we no it was brought

18:46.080 --> 18:51.040
up in the twofer part at the end of the episode but we didn't do it right but you said the thing

18:51.040 --> 18:55.440
was that just a preview of things to come yeah now we're gonna do it we didn't we didn't talk

18:55.440 --> 19:03.600
about it did we so I don't remember this at all so wait hold on it's been 360 episodes and this

19:03.600 --> 19:10.240
is the first one in which Griffin actually said a yahoo last week that we are actually going to

19:10.240 --> 19:14.960
talk about the next week that's the way we've always done it this wasn't the final this wasn't

19:14.960 --> 19:22.320
the final I'm losing my mind I mean I am too I'm literally not lucid right now um how do we make

19:22.320 --> 19:26.160
these fucking juices more relevant to adult consumers it's good it's a good topic do you

19:26.160 --> 19:32.800
want to not do it no I do I do I just I wanted to be the human tweet that we were going to get

19:32.800 --> 19:38.400
okay Travis McElroy is the human tweet here's the thing do you know what the people love these

19:38.400 --> 19:44.560
days can you let me finish the fucking I thought you finished it oh god no you don't you interrupted

19:44.560 --> 19:51.440
him you I don't even remember all the apple juice we make is pure uncut shit fucking send you to

19:51.440 --> 19:58.320
space all the apple juice we make is pure not from concentrate pressed from local apples and sold

19:58.320 --> 20:02.720
shelf stable not chilled we sell our apple juice in four different pack sizes one liter a best

20:02.720 --> 20:11.040
selling format format five pack seven ounce juice boxes and 128 ounce jug and a 46 ounce bottle

20:11.040 --> 20:15.200
primary consumer of apple juice has traditionally been kids concern around the sugar content of

20:15.200 --> 20:19.280
juice along with the aging population in the households having fewer kids has led to apple

20:19.280 --> 20:23.840
juice declines in recent years apple juice is loaded with health benefits that are irrelevant

20:23.840 --> 20:28.400
to adults yet it has never been directly targeted or promoted to them the pure and local nature of

20:28.400 --> 20:33.920
our apple juice is on trend with the today's adult consumer note solutions with alcohol are

20:33.920 --> 20:38.960
not compatible with our brand so think of something else to say Justin and Travis yeah yeah yeah

20:38.960 --> 20:44.400
actually if I could if I could speak on that for a moment uh I went through Taco Bell drive-thru

20:44.400 --> 20:49.600
on my way home from the airport because there's not a lot of options and I liked eating it also

20:49.600 --> 20:55.680
and um to other I prefer it to other options when many options are presented often that is the one

20:55.680 --> 21:02.160
I prefer to eat with my mouth and uh it's cheat day buzz off anyway I ate there and they have a

21:02.160 --> 21:13.440
new option there um that is Mountain Dew spiked I had a moment that I was so fucking excited

21:13.440 --> 21:20.320
about Mountain Dew spiked lemonade that Taco Bell finally it's a one-stop shop well you can get

21:20.320 --> 21:24.000
everything there at three in the morning now after you've been drinking you can now get

21:24.800 --> 21:32.480
drunk drunker yeah and here's the thing it's non-alcoholic and it says you have it says on

21:32.480 --> 21:38.080
the sign does not contain alcohol and I just wanted to say to Taco Bell this is sort of like

21:38.080 --> 21:44.720
a mini Munch Squad diversion I guess if you have to specify that a product does not contain alcohol

21:44.720 --> 21:50.880
maybe it's time to go back to the drawing board on what you named the thing like if you if you

21:50.880 --> 21:57.040
were to have like um we've got a new thing it's apple juice with cocaine and then at the bottom

21:57.040 --> 22:03.680
of the screen it says does not contain any actual cocaine it's probably like time for a new name

22:03.680 --> 22:11.120
yeah back to the drawing board here's my idea for apple juice apple juice here's the thing

22:11.120 --> 22:17.440
you know what people love these days they like beverages that claim health benefits

22:17.440 --> 22:23.760
while also being delicious okay but you can't just say that you can't just be like it's healthy

22:23.760 --> 22:28.400
it's got to be like makes your brain more powerful and gives you the energy to have sex good and

22:28.400 --> 22:34.800
stuff like it's got to sound extreme like coconut water is a thing just make apple water just call

22:34.800 --> 22:40.320
it apple water talk about like it'll make you live to 140 or whatever and you can say whatever

22:40.320 --> 22:46.880
you want because by the time people crack down on that we're on to something else just make whatever

22:46.880 --> 22:55.520
bogus claims you want it's like a moving target yes I this is what Don Draper would do just

22:55.520 --> 23:00.560
fucking call it like sex juice and tell people when you drink apple juice your boners are better

23:00.560 --> 23:05.840
and you look better and everybody enjoys having sex with you more and you'll go for like sting

23:05.840 --> 23:10.880
time and everybody will be impressed with how good you are at sex because you drink some apple juice

23:10.880 --> 23:16.640
when you're down to pound get the fruit that's round and now in a bottle it's sex juice it's

23:16.640 --> 23:22.560
made entirely from apples and other natural ingredients like pan-x which apparently makes

23:22.560 --> 23:31.360
your wiener bigger learn the secret that bees have known for centuries apples make you better

23:31.360 --> 23:38.640
at fucking hey you ever see a horse turn down an apple no you ever see a horse's shlong it's

23:38.640 --> 23:46.160
amazing apples definitely make you good at sex and make it bigger and better for you and your

23:46.160 --> 23:54.960
loved one you heard it straight from the horse's mouth and then when people are like hey that thing

23:54.960 --> 24:00.400
you said about apples and sex isn't true you say well the horse did say nay it's right in there

24:00.400 --> 24:09.440
that's the asterisk could you just put some chunks in there oh my god like orbits like

24:09.440 --> 24:16.320
like people love that what's that like bubble tea but instead it's just chunks of apple that you

24:16.320 --> 24:21.280
have to sift through i don't love that sort of stuff it's sort of like a virgin sangria is what

24:21.280 --> 24:27.840
you're discussing people love filter feeding yeah they love when they're drinking and then they have

24:27.840 --> 24:32.080
to do work yeah and they can push the apple juice out through their baleen you know what i mean and

24:32.080 --> 24:40.080
then just keep the chunks and you get a little snack um i tell you what would sell it for me

24:40.080 --> 24:46.560
can i tell you and this is a fucking this is foolproof okay on my way to wrestlemania last

24:46.560 --> 24:52.480
year and that's an important part of the story i went to stop to bucky's got a big thing a minute

24:52.480 --> 24:58.560
minute time minute time apple juice i think is what it's called and a big big bag of sugar-free

24:58.560 --> 25:05.440
gummy bears and blasted through them both and then they blasted through me with some

25:07.200 --> 25:16.640
just chart topping loose stools just just some some real next level stuff um and so like my idea

25:16.640 --> 25:23.760
is to have them do some sort of eternal sunshine of the spotless mind on me so that i can ever

25:23.760 --> 25:29.040
or because i think here's the thing i think the sugar-free gummy bears are the ones that threw

25:29.040 --> 25:34.000
the party inside of me but the apple juice was certainly a guest of honor and it's going to be

25:34.000 --> 25:42.240
hard for me to sort of divorce it from its role in the festivities um so whatever they can do to

25:42.240 --> 25:47.920
sort of just get that out of out of my mind um so i can enjoy the taste again i'll take my question

25:47.920 --> 25:55.280
i answer off the air uh real talk those fucking little glass balls also that they had on uh boy

25:55.280 --> 26:00.400
meets world and i think on like martin little glass balls they just pull out of the fridge

26:00.400 --> 26:04.880
and i know we've talked about those beautiful globules but like i would drink anything out

26:04.880 --> 26:09.520
of those are you kidding me i'd feel like i'm a fucking diablo 2 barbarian just chugging a

26:09.520 --> 26:15.200
potion getting ready for battle you know what i mean with your toilet i i think the thing that

26:15.200 --> 26:22.480
apple juice is gonna have to overcome is the fact that it is entirely sugar i mean it's just pure

26:22.480 --> 26:26.720
sugar and adults are a little more savvy about that like if you want me to drink something like

26:26.720 --> 26:31.280
if you want me to drink a 12 ounce glass of apple juice you're probably gonna have to do better than

26:31.280 --> 26:38.880
a fucking half cup of sugar in the bottle of apple juice that i'm consuming that's lunacy

26:38.880 --> 26:44.560
yeah no adult's gonna buy that maybe stop making it or you could do like tropic canada's with their

26:44.560 --> 26:49.280
tropican of 50 line and literally just fill half the bottle with water that's what they did and

26:49.280 --> 26:54.880
they're like it's better for you now it's like well i mean yeah yeah yeah in a blend i could

26:54.880 --> 27:00.160
enjoy at home that's why i i've long advocated for gatorade to make a lime that's just called

27:00.160 --> 27:06.640
gatorade weak and it's just watered down because sometimes a gatorade is just too much and you pour

27:06.640 --> 27:10.480
half of it out and you fill it with the water and it's like ah this is exactly the level of

27:10.480 --> 27:16.880
beverage that i desired it's gatorade week it won't it won't help you in sports i love you

27:16.880 --> 27:24.560
i love you gatorade g2 is already a thing and that exists and they done did it they done did

27:24.560 --> 27:31.840
they gotta go now i do love the idea of gatorade for once sort of toning their brand down instead

27:31.840 --> 27:37.760
of just escalating and escalating and escalating until it's just like randy moss eating his way

27:37.760 --> 27:43.440
through a car door to get at the gatorade extreme like that is sitting in the the uh sitting in the

27:43.440 --> 27:49.600
cup holder inside you're looking pretty down what's that you've got eight sonnets to finish

27:49.600 --> 27:54.960
before class tomorrow we'll pound one of these it's gatorade week it's not going to keep you

27:54.960 --> 28:00.880
up too late and it's going to fuel your neurons with a mild amount of electrolytes just this is

28:00.880 --> 28:05.680
the commercial i see just me sitting on the couch i grab a gatorade i take a sip and my face just

28:05.680 --> 28:12.080
kind of goes like oh and it's like too much we totally hear you sorry about that we put too many

28:12.080 --> 28:17.600
electrolytes in there here's a cup dump half of it out now try this we put some water in the

28:17.600 --> 28:23.280
gatorade you already had but we charged you for it again oh that seems fair glug glug glug oh

28:23.280 --> 28:30.080
that's perfectly miles i'm ready to take a nap please enjoy our sleepy time chamomile gatorade

28:30.080 --> 28:42.080

28:42.080 --> 28:47.760
your cravat this morning well maybe you need to fuel your brain and cravat tying fingers

28:47.760 --> 28:56.800
with gatorade week that bonsai tree's not gonna prune itself it's like the cool side of the pillow

28:56.800 --> 29:02.400
in a bottle i work in a hospital and today i went to a subway down the street for lunch i

29:03.280 --> 29:09.280
they didn't capitalize it but i'm gonna assume that it was a restaurant and now i'm i'm one of

29:09.280 --> 29:15.360
the night people and i like to enjoy i think you have to say i went to subway i think if you say

29:15.360 --> 29:19.600
a subway that is a different thing that's different i had my headphones in listening

29:19.600 --> 29:25.440
to my bim bam while i was eating and while i was walking back to work i took off my headphones when

29:25.440 --> 29:29.600
i walked to the door and apparently a doctor had been following behind me and asked me what i got

29:29.600 --> 29:35.680
from subway okay um i had no idea who this doctor was and i just responded that i got a meatball

29:35.680 --> 29:40.240
sammy he told me his favorite is the chicken teriyaki and continued to tell me that the

29:40.240 --> 29:45.360
previous week there was a special where you could get lobster at subway then he just walked away and

29:45.360 --> 29:49.360
didn't say anything else i don't know what the hell just happened to me please help that's from

29:49.360 --> 29:57.920
confusion cincinnati um you just had a conversation like yeah it's just it's just you may congratulations

29:57.920 --> 30:06.000
i mean you made small talk you made it everybody a deep deep connection i mean he was lying

30:07.120 --> 30:13.920
so like i guess that that would be a confusing part he was lying correct oh my god subway did

30:13.920 --> 30:21.760
have a lobster sandwich oh my goodness golly gosh so that's all that happened to you i mean this is

30:21.760 --> 30:28.960
more this feels more to less like a question to me and the bim bam 360 kind of about a triumph

30:28.960 --> 30:33.680
like i had a conversation with someone i made benign small talk for a couple minutes and then

30:33.680 --> 30:39.120
we parted ways they didn't like what usually happens in our questions like try to sell me

30:39.120 --> 30:45.760
a skeleton or grab my butt or whatever like you just had a regular interaction with somebody i

30:45.760 --> 30:50.000
think that's glorious but it's not something you need our help with you did it congratulations

30:51.120 --> 30:55.920
360 you all finally learned how to fly please teach us when you get a second now you do a

30:55.920 --> 31:01.280
podcast and we'll listen to it what's your favorite subway sammy though i used to fuck

31:01.280 --> 31:07.440
with the chicken bacon ranch but can't 30 39 30 i can't have ranch anymore i had a weird

31:07.440 --> 31:12.800
realization the first time i went to a subway that wasn't in huntington west virginia and

31:12.800 --> 31:20.080
tried to find my favorite pizza sub on the menu and not a nationwide experience i think the pizza

31:20.080 --> 31:24.240
sub i think you could probably gen one up they just make it there for you you would get that

31:24.240 --> 31:27.440
they you came in and ordered it one day and they're like i guess we'll put some marinara

31:27.440 --> 31:34.080
on some shit and cheese it and okay here you go little small boy we love you very much

31:34.080 --> 31:40.800
very good job i guess that's not a national thing i don't know they're very big in west virginia

31:40.800 --> 31:45.520
though i don't know they're every west virginia subway i don't have a favorite i just like walk

31:45.520 --> 31:52.160
in and say surprise me okay they're all good i've never been disappointed i used to this is true

31:52.160 --> 31:58.640
back when i was a young man who didn't know better used to get the tuna sub the tuna sub at subway

31:58.640 --> 32:04.320
oh what a mistake that was that's the one that they make with the tuna salad in subway right

32:04.320 --> 32:12.560
yeah that's the one that they make begrudgingly are you sure yeah yeah it's sort of a hesitant

32:12.560 --> 32:17.680
scoop that you get on that one uh like you'll get a half scoop of it i'm just trying to limit

32:17.680 --> 32:21.440
the risk here when they go to hand it to you they'll jerk it back click and they're like

32:21.440 --> 32:27.600
are we on a prank show please don't do this to us they said you order it and they say ah trying

32:27.600 --> 32:33.760
not to get somebody to not sit next to you on the bus today huh very clever there are safer ways to

32:33.760 --> 32:50.000
do this sir uh let's get the money some my brother my brother me that's right this podcast is supported

32:50.000 --> 32:59.680
in part by casper an online retailer of premium premium obsessively engineered mattresses for a

32:59.680 --> 33:05.200
fraction of the price up the price of what i don't know it's not in the copy point but like think of

33:05.200 --> 33:13.520
something else and it's less than that think of a big price no you're wrong or or you might have

33:13.520 --> 33:18.640
thought like sixty dollars and that is too low that's actually come on it's it is a mattress

33:18.640 --> 33:24.400
it's like be be fucking serious and don't you like 801 because the person next to you said 800

33:24.400 --> 33:31.920
that's cheap that a fucking oh it's the worst casper uh they the box you get from casper should

33:31.920 --> 33:38.320
not contain a mattress but it does and that's the first sin of casper and it's really there's

33:38.320 --> 33:43.040
several sins though they should not be this cheap that's gluttony i think is one of those

33:43.040 --> 33:49.600
it's our and but and the other sin is they've defied god and made a box too small to hold a

33:49.600 --> 33:55.680
mattress that does hold a mattress when you open it just like expands out and the sin is everywhere

33:55.680 --> 34:00.400
it's like what i what i always imagined in cartoons when they like had an emergency raft

34:00.400 --> 34:05.120
and it was like a little envelope and then they pull it unfolds that's basically a casper mattress

34:05.680 --> 34:10.240
um except it's not funny it's just comfort well it does kind of make a funny noise i guess yeah

34:10.240 --> 34:16.880
kind of makes this like so far yeah that's very quiet one though there's a risk-free uh trial and

34:16.880 --> 34:21.040
return policy you're not going to want to do this but you can try sleeping on a casper for 100 days

34:21.040 --> 34:26.240
with free delivery to the us and canada and painless returns now when they say that that's

34:26.240 --> 34:30.320
a lie because you are going to have to stuff it back in that mattress and you're not a wizard

34:30.320 --> 34:34.320
so you're going to be at that for the rest of your days um that's not sure i'm sure there's

34:34.320 --> 34:37.760
another way of getting the mattress back to them uh and these matches they're made right here in

34:37.760 --> 34:44.880
the good old us of a our listeners can get 50 towards any mattress purchase if they go to

34:44.880 --> 34:51.760
casper.com slash my brother and use the promo code my brother that's all one word at checkout

34:52.400 --> 34:59.200
and it says here also terms and additions apply i would like to tell you about i beat you to it

34:59.200 --> 35:06.240
i would like to tell you about a service i call blapron because i'm a man on the go i don't have

35:06.240 --> 35:13.840
time to say blue apron anymore so i shortened it to a mess a messy sticky new yorker exactly i gotta

35:13.840 --> 35:19.680
go go go i don't have time to go to the store and figure out how much of what ingredient i want and

35:19.680 --> 35:24.720
how to cook it and what ingredients are required for what recipe and what recipes are and where

35:24.720 --> 35:30.320

here they huge vape rigs yeah yeah hey guys this is adam conover you may know me from my true tv

39:10.800 --> 39:15.120
show adam ruins everything well guess what now we're doing a podcast version right here on

39:15.120 --> 39:19.200
maximum fun what we do is we take all the interesting fascinating experts that we talked

39:19.200 --> 39:23.920
to for just a couple minutes on the show and we sit with them for an entire podcast really going

39:23.920 --> 39:28.640
deep and getting into the fascinating details of their work find adam ruins everything wherever

39:28.640 --> 39:35.040
you get your podcasts or at maximum fun.org how about yahoo yeah that would go down real smooth

39:35.040 --> 39:41.680
right now this one was sent in by ryan p fahmy thank you ryan it's yahoo answers user no name

39:42.880 --> 39:48.000
that is their name i don't know why um should i invent a contraption that only the very smart

39:48.000 --> 39:54.000
sperm cells are able to make it through will this make future generations smarter i am a scientist

39:56.160 --> 40:01.840
i am a scientist i therefore want to invent some sort of maze that sperm cells have to move through

40:01.840 --> 40:07.040
the problem with this maze is that only the most intelligent sperm cells will be able to make it

40:07.040 --> 40:11.120
through this maze therefore since only the most intelligent sperm cells will make it through the

40:11.120 --> 40:16.000
maze the egg will only be fertilized by the most intelligent sperm and an egg fertilized by an

40:16.000 --> 40:20.400
intelligent sperm cell will make a super intelligent baby again just to go back to

40:20.400 --> 40:28.800
the first sentence here i am a scientist this is some um i mean light eugenics it's

40:28.800 --> 40:37.920
it's yeah it's a mild soft um here's what let me hit you with this open up sunday paper laugh at

40:37.920 --> 40:42.640
foxtrot done i'm i'm glad i'm done with this sunday paper because it will not be usable after

40:42.640 --> 40:49.120
this next part find the the maze or if your local paper does not have a maze junior jumble

40:49.120 --> 40:57.840
or maybe even the sudoku blast one out on it see who wins take that one and then do a pregnancy

40:57.840 --> 41:07.040
with it so i'm a scientist and i i'll tell you the the issue is that i came on the junior jumble

41:07.040 --> 41:12.480
solved it right there and the one that i saw sort of scribbling out the answers scooped him up with

41:12.480 --> 41:21.440
a you know tool science tool and did a pregnancy with it and uh einstein jr came out so my problem

41:21.440 --> 41:27.920
with this is that there's a lot of different kinds of intelligence yeah and i didn't get fluid liquid

41:27.920 --> 41:35.520
and what you're solving for is a very particular type of um a very particular type of intelligence

41:35.520 --> 41:42.640
and i'm not necessarily sure i'm ready for a world populated by basically just will shorts just like

41:42.640 --> 41:51.040
a sort of huge gaggle of will shortes just sort of running buck wild across yeah where's our like

41:51.040 --> 41:55.760
street smart sperm you know what i mean like they can't make it through a maze but they could tell

41:55.760 --> 42:02.080
you how to get like how to get to the store the quickest way or like well let me tell you this is

42:02.080 --> 42:05.920
how it works this is where you're going to get like the freshest you know vegetables at the market

42:05.920 --> 42:11.600
or like uh you need to make friends with the bus drivers and that's how like where's that

42:11.600 --> 42:16.400
kind of intelligence they kind of tell us that they don't teach at sperm school you know yes

42:16.400 --> 42:23.520
um the kind you learn living on the streets of goo york oh man

42:25.120 --> 42:31.120
we've talked a lot about new york which one they're both gonna stick right i mean they're

42:31.120 --> 42:39.200
both sort of well something's gonna stick oh god thanks i just want a sperm that's gonna be able to

42:39.200 --> 42:44.400
like explain twin peaks that return to me just like tell like oh i've never thought of it that

42:44.400 --> 42:48.720
way you're intelligent in a very specific way so in order to come up with that joke i just said i

42:48.720 --> 42:52.320
was trying to think of like a movie i could say there instead so i googled smart movies and just

42:52.320 --> 42:58.960
like going down um the google search history that just popped up in my bar smart movies apple juice

42:58.960 --> 43:06.160
diarrhea dave thomas problematic dave hester's son these are all very very good i am on the fbi

43:06.160 --> 43:14.400
watch list for some something uh here is another question um whenever i'm part of a group photo

43:14.400 --> 43:19.280
inevitably someone says okay now let's do a silly one i never know what to do for these and usually

43:19.280 --> 43:24.400
just didn't up making a face it looks like i'm in pain any help for what could be my thing that's

43:24.400 --> 43:30.480
from sans silly in san francisco and if you're looking to measure sibilance in your broadcasting

43:30.480 --> 43:37.360
equipment that's a pretty good one to go for um i like about this i like uh just like a context

43:37.360 --> 43:44.960
list silly like no matter where this silly will always play you know what i mean i try to just

43:44.960 --> 43:49.520
sort of register my disappointment in the request in the photo itself and then like if everybody

43:49.520 --> 43:58.400
else is like making a fart face or a funny you know like either yelling or doing a like a you

43:58.400 --> 44:04.160
know a fucking jack jack nicholson like you know uh but you just you see my face in the background

44:04.160 --> 44:10.320
i'm like fuck off with it like it's kind of funny it's like a silly you know i'll tell you a good

44:10.320 --> 44:17.120
i'll tell you good go to turn around goku well that also works but turn around just turn your

44:17.120 --> 44:22.720
back on the camera that's so silly because the camera's supposed to your face yeah and you put

44:22.720 --> 44:28.560
your glasses on the back of your head and unbutton the your butt flaps so your butt's hanging out like

44:28.560 --> 44:35.200
a little kid and turn your shirt around so the ties on on your back and also turn your pants

44:35.200 --> 44:40.800
wait no then then it does just look like you're facing forward and maybe it won't play put eyes

44:40.800 --> 44:47.040
and a nose on the back of your head oh wait it's gotten away well get out of the blow up sexual

44:47.040 --> 44:53.520

44:53.520 --> 44:56.560
photo while you're blowing it up it's not going to play you need the fully blown up sexual doll

44:56.560 --> 45:00.880
that you have with you pull it out of your backpack and do it right there so good dude

45:00.880 --> 45:08.400
are you kidding if i saw that fuck maybe you take a picture of them taking a picture of you

45:08.400 --> 45:15.920
oh you have your own camera yeah push it like just start pushing everyone around you really hard

45:15.920 --> 45:21.440
don't hurt them but just push them all over push them here's one that you all see a lot just give

45:21.440 --> 45:26.960
them like a was that was that was great because they'll be so excited to see that that's and

45:26.960 --> 45:31.280
somebody looks at that photo they're like when was this taken and you'll have to convince them

45:31.280 --> 45:36.320
that like no it was not during the wasab craze of that particular super bowl it was afterwards

45:36.320 --> 45:40.160
ironic why don't you want to hinge your jaw and put the head of the person standing in front of

45:40.160 --> 45:46.000
you completely in your mouth like a big snake or something i love that that's really funny when you

45:46.000 --> 45:54.320
do that vogue vogue is good voguing is good maybe put on a really convincing mask so it's like

45:54.320 --> 46:02.320
suddenly what's that oh tom cruise was there what's he doing there but he wasn't so you're

46:02.320 --> 46:10.480
so you're thinking that you maybe are getting ready to leave for an event and you'll just sort

46:10.480 --> 46:18.240
of put into your back pocket a mask of tom cruise that you'll like just sort of carry with you

46:18.240 --> 46:23.440
throughout the day for this payoff you make an accent point justin what you're gonna need to do

46:23.440 --> 46:29.360
and i i will consider this part an homage to mr cruise himself you're going to already want to

46:29.360 --> 46:37.520
have the tom cruise mask on and then put a mask of yourself over it oh remove your mask to reveal

46:37.520 --> 46:44.160
tom cruise mask then it's good like mission impossible jokes exactly what about ellen ellen

46:44.160 --> 46:51.600
what about ellen um and bradley whitford brad bradley cooper do you remember at the oscars when

46:51.600 --> 46:56.720
they took that picture and like everybody was really deeply into it yeah for sure could you

46:56.720 --> 47:02.400
do something could you do something like that that's what that's taking a picture though

47:02.400 --> 47:07.440
griffin like you're you're already doing something like that by taking the picture i was just trying

47:07.440 --> 47:11.600
to take a good picture like good funny pictures it's a it's a hard needle of thread and they did

47:11.600 --> 47:17.920
a good job can you wear a child's uh two-piece bathing suit and then right when the picture's

47:17.920 --> 47:23.360
about to be taken you get a dog to kind of funny cute come up and like pull the bottom of your

47:23.360 --> 47:31.040
britches down i like that sort of like the exposed butt's gonna get you there like no matter what

47:31.040 --> 47:35.760
there's really no if your first ingredient is exposed but there's really no recipe but not

47:35.760 --> 47:40.720
mooning not mooning because that's gross and awful but like if a dog comes and shows your

47:40.720 --> 47:46.560
butt a little bit then here's my worry here's my worry about exposed butt guys oh yeah first

47:46.560 --> 47:53.840
time it's pretty funny the second third fourth fifth like okay but then do you think it comes

47:53.840 --> 48:05.040
back around on like the 12th time like he's doing but again yeah what if you just i don't know man

48:05.040 --> 48:12.560
smiled if you just have a nice smile what if you oh this is fucking great this is great

48:12.560 --> 48:17.840
just do like a fucking like sexy smile and then everybody else around you is like

48:20.560 --> 48:26.000
and you're in the background just like what's up but not in like the budweiser way but like

48:26.000 --> 48:30.000
just that you're saying it in a cool way then everybody's gonna look at this picture and be

48:30.000 --> 48:35.760
like look at all these jagoffs wait a minute who's that in the background who is this they

48:35.760 --> 48:41.360
they look like they just drank a bunch of apple juice so they're ready to go to my home my home

48:41.360 --> 48:47.280
to my hometown and here's here's the here's the power move if anyone sees that photo and says to

48:47.280 --> 48:52.560
you like that's weird everybody's doing a silly one why didn't you do a silly one you say here's

48:52.560 --> 48:58.480
the weird thing the photographer didn't say yeah that we were gonna do a silly one everyone else

48:58.480 --> 49:03.680
are just that's so good so they photographer actually said make it do a sexy one and that's

49:03.680 --> 49:07.440
why i look so sexy everybody else you see in this picture and it's everybody that is at this party

49:07.440 --> 49:11.360
that i they look really pissed off because i'm saying this really loudly so they can they're a

49:11.360 --> 49:18.560
bunch of fucking clowns when it comes to sexuality so what i'm saying is that i'm a mature grown-up

49:18.560 --> 49:25.040
who is in full control of their own sexuality yeah and and that could be yours that's what i've got

49:25.040 --> 49:30.560
on on doc every time you go to a party that these people host you bring that picture with you your

49:30.560 --> 49:35.280
new person comes apart hi what's up i'm david let me show you this picture before you sort of start

49:35.280 --> 49:44.000
making judgments about people here at the house um that is me in the back yeah it's different

49:44.000 --> 49:48.080
than everyone else i know we were asked by the photographer to confront and expose our own

49:48.080 --> 49:54.800
sexuality and this is what these i mean forgive me clowns brought to the table vis-a-vis their

49:54.800 --> 49:59.920
their own human beautiful human sexuality do you like to get out of here would you like to get out

49:59.920 --> 50:03.440
of this den of clowns do you want to get out of here do you want to hook up with uh let's see

50:03.440 --> 50:08.080
there's two different groups of people doing charlie's angels so that's their sex so maybe

50:08.080 --> 50:14.160
we should just a go because it's as good as it gets jack nicholson do you guys think when they

50:14.160 --> 50:22.080
do a group shot at an event for clowns and they're like do a silly one i bet it fucking pops off

50:22.080 --> 50:29.040
right i bet it's like so silly back when clowns were legal because barnum and bailey shut down

50:29.040 --> 50:35.840
and by the way everybody just a heads up about that barnum bailey shut down so be on the lookout

50:35.840 --> 50:41.520
for clowns and jugglers just like roaming the streets like wild animals specifically jugglers

50:41.520 --> 50:46.560
you have to look out for but um i i would be careful about that i was driving the grocery

50:46.560 --> 50:51.600
store with my kids and i looked to my left and there's a motorcycle on a big steel ball

50:51.600 --> 50:55.600
it's not safe that's not safe get that off the road big steel ball could roll over my car crush

50:55.600 --> 50:59.760
like indiana jones here's the good here's the good news you're gonna see jugglers and you're

50:59.760 --> 51:03.200
gonna be terrified because they have the projectiles right there in their hands and it's

51:03.200 --> 51:08.400
very very scary but the truth is if they were to use one of those projectiles they then lose all

51:08.400 --> 51:13.360
their power and die like exactly don't be afraid of them yeah it's they're they're a lot more

51:13.360 --> 51:18.080
threatening uh looking than they actually are but don't get too close because if threatened

51:18.080 --> 51:24.480
they will sacrifice their juggling career to fend you off so appreciate it at a distance

51:24.480 --> 51:30.960
um the danger the majestic danger of the juggler well folks that's got to do it for us here on my

51:30.960 --> 51:38.400
