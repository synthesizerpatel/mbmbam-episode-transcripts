00:00.000 --> 00:02.960
Hey folks, it's Jesse, the founder of MaxFun.

00:02.960 --> 00:07.120
Since we postponed our annual MaxFun drive in mid-March,

00:07.120 --> 00:09.520
we have gotten a lot of questions about if and when

00:09.520 --> 00:11.240
we'd be rescheduling it.

00:11.240 --> 00:14.440
And honestly, we've been asking ourselves the same thing.

00:14.440 --> 00:17.040
Well, now we have an answer for you.

00:17.040 --> 00:20.480
The 2020 MaxFun drive will start on July 13th.

00:20.480 --> 00:21.840
That's coming up soon.

00:21.840 --> 00:23.760
We decided to have the drive now

00:23.760 --> 00:27.040
because it's always brought a lot of joy and excitement

00:27.040 --> 00:29.400
to our community and certainly to us.

00:29.400 --> 00:30.560
And to be totally honest,

00:30.560 --> 00:34.160
it's also the main source of income for some of our hosts.

00:34.160 --> 00:35.520
Like pretty much everything right now,

00:35.520 --> 00:37.880
this year's drive is gonna be a little different.

00:37.880 --> 00:40.360
We'll still be bringing you very special episodes,

00:40.360 --> 00:43.720
fun community activities, premium thank you gifts,

00:43.720 --> 00:45.560
but we also know it's a weird time

00:45.560 --> 00:48.040
and for some folks, a really difficult one.

00:48.040 --> 00:49.800
Some people are in a position to become new

00:49.800 --> 00:52.000
or upgrading members, others can't right now.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.680
And that is okay.

00:53.680 --> 00:56.920
We'll have ways for you to support MaxFun at every level,

00:56.920 --> 00:59.960
including some ways that won't cost you anything.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.280
We're also gonna run the drive for four weeks

01:02.280 --> 01:03.600
instead of two.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.840
We didn't think it was a good time to be rushing anybody

01:05.840 --> 01:09.440
and having a longer drive lets us be a little more low key

01:09.440 --> 01:11.040
in our drive pitch.

01:11.040 --> 01:13.600
It also gives us more time to do fun stuff,

01:13.600 --> 01:15.760
like the weekly live streams we'll be putting on

01:15.760 --> 01:17.880
for charity throughout the drive.

01:17.880 --> 01:20.520
Most importantly, we want the 2020 MaxFun drive

01:20.520 --> 01:22.840
to highlight all the ways we support each other

01:22.840 --> 01:24.200
and our communities.

01:24.200 --> 01:27.520
We also wanna show how grateful we are to you

01:27.520 --> 01:30.880
for making all the work that we do possible.

01:30.880 --> 01:34.560
Stay safe, we'll see you July 13th for the MaxFun drive.

01:34.560 --> 01:37.200
The McElroy brothers are not experts

01:37.200 --> 01:40.080
and their advice should never be followed.

01:40.080 --> 01:42.440
Travis insists he's a sexpert,

01:42.440 --> 01:45.840
but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

01:45.840 --> 01:48.160
Also, this show isn't for kids,

01:48.160 --> 01:50.560
which I mentioned only so the babies out there

01:50.560 --> 01:52.880
will know how cool they are for listening.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.360
What's up, you cool baby?

01:54.360 --> 02:01.360
It's familiar, but not too familiar,

02:01.360 --> 02:05.360
but not too not familiar.

02:05.360 --> 02:08.360
It's a new craze.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.360
And good girls, do you want it?

02:10.360 --> 02:13.360
Just say, hey, I want it.

02:13.360 --> 02:15.360
Just say, hey, I want it.

02:18.360 --> 02:21.360
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother,

02:21.360 --> 02:23.360
Me, an advice show for the modern era.

02:23.360 --> 02:26.360
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

02:26.360 --> 02:28.360
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy,

02:28.360 --> 02:30.360
and you can bite my butt.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.360
Whoa, hachi-machi.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.360
I don't even wanna say my name

02:34.360 --> 02:36.360
because I don't want people to get me confused

02:36.360 --> 02:38.360
with the attitude that Travis just brought to the table.

02:38.360 --> 02:41.360
That one was Travis, it's not me, I'm Griffin.

02:41.360 --> 02:43.360
Guys, I'm sorry, real quick.

02:43.360 --> 02:45.360
I should have talked with you guys about this off mic

02:45.360 --> 02:48.360
before I started, but the director called me,

02:48.360 --> 02:50.360
the My Brother, My Brother, Me director

02:50.360 --> 02:52.360
and the executive producers and stuff.

02:52.360 --> 02:53.360
Sure.

02:53.360 --> 02:55.360
And they said that I need to make a heel turn.

02:55.360 --> 02:56.360
Okay.

02:56.360 --> 03:00.360
That we've been without kind of conflict for too long,

03:00.360 --> 03:03.360
and I've been playing the nice guy for a while now,

03:03.360 --> 03:05.360
and so I have to do like a heel turn.

03:05.360 --> 03:06.360
So just kind of, if you can-

03:06.360 --> 03:09.360
So this has been you as the nice guy the whole time?

03:09.360 --> 03:11.360
Yeah, this has been me being nice,

03:11.360 --> 03:13.360
and now I have to do a heel turn.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.360
So if you guys could just like play off it

03:16.360 --> 03:18.360
and kind of let me be the villain.

03:18.360 --> 03:23.360
I need to talk to Cameron Crowe, the director of our podcast,

03:23.360 --> 03:25.360
because I don't know,

03:25.360 --> 03:27.360
I've never had to deal with that energy in the show,

03:27.360 --> 03:29.360
so I'm not sure how to do that.

03:29.360 --> 03:30.360
Feels hostile.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.360
We're a little, we're all flying.

03:32.360 --> 03:33.360
That's the idea, right?

03:33.360 --> 03:34.360
Yeah, that's the point.

03:34.360 --> 03:36.360
Justin and I don't know how to play with that in the space.

03:36.360 --> 03:37.360
I love playing in the space,

03:37.360 --> 03:39.360
but that doesn't seem like a fun game.

03:39.360 --> 03:41.360
Well, maybe we can find it,

03:41.360 --> 03:44.360
and I don't know that I, do I have to be mean to you?

03:44.360 --> 03:46.360
Or just like mean?

03:46.360 --> 03:49.360
I mean, people like the general anger sometimes.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.360
Okay, well let's just start, we'll just start.

03:51.360 --> 03:53.360
Justin, you do like an intro.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.360
Just something, draw anything.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.360
I already did that, I already did that.

03:56.360 --> 03:58.360
No, no, no, I mean like pick a topic or something.

03:58.360 --> 03:59.360
Like, hey, have you ever noticed?

03:59.360 --> 04:02.360
Let's do just a general sort of,

04:02.360 --> 04:03.360
well, we did a watch last week.

04:03.360 --> 04:05.360
Justin, maybe you can tell us a funny story about kids.

04:05.360 --> 04:06.360
Yeah, go for it.

04:06.360 --> 04:07.360
Um, okay.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.360
Kids do silly, say like kids,

04:09.360 --> 04:10.360
hey, kids did a silly thing today.

04:10.360 --> 04:12.360
Oh, this is great, actually.

04:12.360 --> 04:15.360
I went to, I was driving with Charlie.

04:15.360 --> 04:16.360
I don't care.

04:16.360 --> 04:17.360
Wow.

04:17.360 --> 04:18.360
Wow.

04:18.360 --> 04:21.360
I don't know how conducive this is gonna be to call the guys.

04:21.360 --> 04:22.360
Okay, I'm sorry.

04:22.360 --> 04:23.360
You know what?

04:23.360 --> 04:24.360
That was bad.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.360
That was, I'm gonna take that note.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.360
I'm gonna take that note, let me try again, okay?

04:28.360 --> 04:29.360
Give it to me again.

04:29.360 --> 04:30.360
Okay.

04:30.360 --> 04:31.360
I was driving with Charlie,

04:31.360 --> 04:34.360
and we were going to pick up some,

04:34.360 --> 04:39.360
we had ordered some baked goods from like a local,

04:39.360 --> 04:41.360
from a local bakery called,

04:41.360 --> 04:45.360
that's not, that's super not nice.

04:45.360 --> 04:48.360
That's actually funny about it, damn it.

04:48.360 --> 04:50.360
From a local bakery called the,

04:50.360 --> 04:52.360
That's fucking good.

04:52.360 --> 04:57.360
A local bakery called the,

04:57.360 --> 04:59.360
Okay, I hate it now.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.360
I've turned around on it.

05:00.360 --> 05:03.360
That's still pretty good for me.

05:03.360 --> 05:05.360
She said the funniest thing.

05:05.360 --> 05:06.360
Awuga.

05:06.360 --> 05:07.360
Yeah.

05:07.360 --> 05:09.360
I left my airborne, yeah, sorry.

05:09.360 --> 05:14.360
I feel like I don't appreciate the fact

05:14.360 --> 05:17.360
that Travis sort of nominated himself to be the heel turn.

05:17.360 --> 05:20.360
It wasn't me, but listen, I will say,

05:20.360 --> 05:24.360
I think this is a very collaborative effort.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.360
If one of you wants to make a heel turn,

05:26.360 --> 05:29.360
and I can stick with being nice, we could try that.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.360
All right, Travis, you do a nice thing,

05:31.360 --> 05:34.360
and then Griff, do you want to be like the bad boy?

05:34.360 --> 05:35.360
I can try.

05:35.360 --> 05:37.360
Do you guys think you could call me donkey dick?

05:37.360 --> 05:38.360
Yeah.

05:38.360 --> 05:40.360
Yeah, like I was thinking that could be his name.

05:40.360 --> 05:42.360
What about donkey dick Dave?

05:42.360 --> 05:45.360
No, just, that's because I'm Griffin.

05:45.360 --> 05:46.360
Oh, okay, got it.

05:46.360 --> 05:47.360
Okay, got it, okay.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.360
I just want to say thank you to everybody

05:49.360 --> 05:51.360
for listening, your support during this time

05:51.360 --> 05:53.360
has just meant so much to us,

05:53.360 --> 05:57.360
and like people telling their friends about the show.

05:57.360 --> 06:01.360
Donkey dick likes it too.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.360
Okay, well that's nice.

06:03.360 --> 06:06.360
That's more supportive than I expected.

06:06.360 --> 06:07.360
Pretty good.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.360
From donkey dick.

06:08.360 --> 06:12.360
Yeah, okay, and so I guess from donkey dick and all of us,

06:12.360 --> 06:15.360
thank you for supporting my brother and my brother.

06:15.360 --> 06:17.360
Love to your family from donkey dick.

06:17.360 --> 06:25.360
Okay, sorry, donkey dick, is this sincere or?

06:25.360 --> 06:27.360
Yeah, it's fucking, yeah,

06:27.360 --> 06:29.360
but it's the way he's saying it,

06:29.360 --> 06:31.360
and the fact that his name is donkey dick is mean.

06:31.360 --> 06:33.360
Oh, okay, cool, cool, cool.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.360
Justin, do you want to try saying something nice

06:35.360 --> 06:38.360
to let donkey dick play off of that energy?

06:38.360 --> 06:40.360
Well, there can't be, hold up, hold up, hold up.

06:40.360 --> 06:42.360
There can't be two of us bad and mean at the same time,

06:42.360 --> 06:44.360
so let me, hold on, give me a second.

06:44.360 --> 06:47.360
Okay, I just put donkey dick in the drawer, Justin.

06:47.360 --> 06:49.360
Wait, I've lost the plot now.

06:49.360 --> 06:50.360
Am I nice or mean?

06:50.360 --> 06:52.360
Wait, Griffin, you say something

06:52.360 --> 06:54.360
and let Justin, you be the heel, Justin,

06:54.360 --> 06:56.360
and you react to it.

06:56.360 --> 07:04.360
Okay, yeah, so I got stung by a big bee yesterday.

07:04.360 --> 07:06.360
Shut up and tell jokes.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.360
Well, that's too real.

07:08.360 --> 07:10.360
This is the start of the joke,

07:10.360 --> 07:12.360
so if you would be chill for a fucking joke.

07:12.360 --> 07:14.360
Sorry, my bad.

07:14.360 --> 07:16.360
No, it's okay, you didn't know.

07:16.360 --> 07:18.360
The construction of the sentence was such that

07:18.360 --> 07:20.360
it could have just been an anecdote.

07:20.360 --> 07:22.360
No, go ahead, it's fine.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.360
Okay, so I got stung by a big bee yesterday

07:24.360 --> 07:25.360
right on my face.

07:25.360 --> 07:26.360
Is this still the beginning?

07:26.360 --> 07:27.360
Yeah.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.360
Go for it.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.360
So I was playing around in the backyard yesterday

07:31.360 --> 07:33.360
playing some baseball with my friends,

07:33.360 --> 07:35.360
and then a big bee came around and stung me.

07:35.360 --> 07:37.360
I'm getting pretty worked up for the joke.

07:37.360 --> 07:39.360
Stung me right on my fanny.

07:39.360 --> 07:41.360
Was that the joke?

07:41.360 --> 07:42.360
No, it's still the setup.

07:42.360 --> 07:43.360
I've said that part already.

07:43.360 --> 07:44.360
I'm getting amped.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.360
I'm getting amped for it over here.

07:46.360 --> 07:48.360
So I was looking for the EpiPen that I need

07:48.360 --> 07:50.360
to keep myself alive.

07:50.360 --> 07:52.360
Oh, fuck.

07:52.360 --> 07:54.360
And I came inside and I found it.

07:54.360 --> 07:55.360
Throw it down.

07:55.360 --> 07:57.360
Go for it, this is the moment right now.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.360
I found it in the kitchen drawer.

07:59.360 --> 08:01.360
We're ready, drop it.

08:01.360 --> 08:02.360
I jabbed it into my butt

08:02.360 --> 08:05.360
and I realized it was a regular Bic pen.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.360
Just a regular Bic pen.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.360
And I put a bunch of ink in my butt.

08:08.360 --> 08:10.360
So did you die?

08:10.360 --> 08:11.360
No, I didn't die.

08:11.360 --> 08:13.360
I'm here recording the show with you now.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.360
Do the joke.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.360
I'm sorry, that was the joke.

08:16.360 --> 08:18.360
Say it funnier.

08:18.360 --> 08:21.360
I stabbed a fucking Bic pen in my ass cheeks

08:21.360 --> 08:24.360
and poop happened.

08:24.360 --> 08:28.360
Do four more jokes.

08:28.360 --> 08:30.360
Yeah, okay.

08:30.360 --> 08:33.360
We have to get some alts on that.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.360
Could you give us another read?

08:35.360 --> 08:38.360
I would love to hear another read on the punchline

08:38.360 --> 08:40.360
just for safety.

08:40.360 --> 08:41.360
Okay.

08:41.360 --> 08:43.360
But then I looked down and it turned out

08:43.360 --> 08:45.360
it wasn't my EpiPen.

08:45.360 --> 08:51.360
It was a Charms Blow Pop.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.360
And it went in.

08:53.360 --> 08:56.360
Can you do it again but without the brand name?

08:56.360 --> 08:57.360
Yeah.

08:57.360 --> 09:00.360
When I pulled it out, I realized it wasn't my EpiPen.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.360
It was a lollipop with bubble gum.

09:02.360 --> 09:03.360
EpiPen's a brand name.

09:03.360 --> 09:05.360
It wasn't my allergies.

09:05.360 --> 09:09.360
It wasn't my energy life-saving allergies pen.

09:09.360 --> 09:12.360
It was a lollipop with bubble gum inside.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.360
A little faster.

09:14.360 --> 09:15.360
Fuck.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.360
I'm just going to comment.

09:16.360 --> 09:17.360
Sorry.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.360
I'm just a producer.

09:18.360 --> 09:19.360
But a real quick note.

09:19.360 --> 09:20.360
What if it was an EpiPen?

09:20.360 --> 09:22.360
Can you try that?

09:22.360 --> 09:24.360
Wait, but he just said I shouldn't do it.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.360
No, but don't say the brand name.

09:26.360 --> 09:27.360
But you did find it.

09:27.360 --> 09:28.360
Yes, yes, yes.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.360
Okay, so I stabbed it.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.360
Can I get some clicks for the edit?

09:31.360 --> 09:34.360
Yeah, here.

09:34.360 --> 09:36.360
So I poked it into my butt.

09:36.360 --> 09:41.360
And when I looked down, it was my life-saving allergy dispenser.

09:41.360 --> 09:42.360
And I felt better.

09:42.360 --> 09:43.360
And my butt didn't hurt anymore.

09:43.360 --> 09:45.360
And I went back outside and finished the baseball game

09:45.360 --> 09:46.360
with my friends.

09:46.360 --> 09:49.360
You are on some next level shit right now.

09:49.360 --> 09:50.360
I'm loving this.

09:50.360 --> 09:52.360
See, Travis, I'll be honest.

09:52.360 --> 09:54.360
I was nervous about this energy.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.360
But I think it's really amped up the show.

09:56.360 --> 09:57.360
I think so, too.

09:57.360 --> 09:58.360
This is a show now.

09:58.360 --> 09:59.360
I'm psyched out of my mind.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.360
Yeah, I'm psyched out of my mind.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.360
Let's fucking tear into it.

10:01.360 --> 10:02.360
Let's ride this wave.

10:02.360 --> 10:05.360
I had a kitchen-sized trash can with a latch-closed lid

10:05.360 --> 10:07.360
that broke a few years ago.

10:07.360 --> 10:09.360
Can you imagine if a friend of yours came up to you

10:09.360 --> 10:11.360
and started a story that way?

10:11.360 --> 10:13.360
And it's like, this is going to be a boring story.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.360
No friend of mine would tell me a story like this.

10:15.360 --> 10:17.360
Okay, but to be fair, Justin,

10:17.360 --> 10:21.360
our show conceit is not impress us.

10:21.360 --> 10:25.360
I'm still in the heel-turn phase.

10:25.360 --> 10:27.360
I want people to juice it.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.360
You know what I mean?

10:28.360 --> 10:29.360
Yeah, sure.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.360
Hook me.

10:30.360 --> 10:33.360
I finally replaced it and left the trash can

10:33.360 --> 10:35.360
and its broken lid out with my garbage.

10:35.360 --> 10:36.360
When the trash people came,

10:36.360 --> 10:38.360
they left the empty trash bin

10:38.360 --> 10:41.360
with my other larger empty trash bins.

10:41.360 --> 10:44.360
How do I signal to the trash service people,

10:44.360 --> 10:47.360
this is part of my trash?

10:47.360 --> 10:50.360
Do you know how long this person

10:50.360 --> 10:53.360
probably agonized over trash service people?

10:53.360 --> 10:55.360
What's the best way of saying this?

10:55.360 --> 10:56.360
Trash collector.

10:56.360 --> 10:59.360
Trash collectors makes it sound like it's not a job.

10:59.360 --> 11:02.360
Sanitation workers are dumb.

11:02.360 --> 11:04.360
Trash man is bad.

11:04.360 --> 11:07.360
How do I throw away this trash can?

11:07.360 --> 11:11.360
Am I doomed to have it sitting next to my big bins forever?

11:11.360 --> 11:14.360
That's from Scrap Stooge in Somerville.

11:14.360 --> 11:18.360
I have had this exact problem.

11:18.360 --> 11:19.360
I think we all have.

11:19.360 --> 11:22.360
Trash cans aren't immortal.

11:22.360 --> 11:27.360
We have one legal, ethical way of getting rid of them.

11:27.360 --> 11:31.360
In that one way, there is a loophole

11:31.360 --> 11:35.360
that renders the whole thing kind of inert.

11:35.360 --> 11:38.360
What I did once when I was moving away

11:38.360 --> 11:41.360
from an apartment in Chicago

11:41.360 --> 11:44.360
is I picked up a big cinder block

11:44.360 --> 11:47.360
and dropped it on the big plastic trash can

11:47.360 --> 11:49.360
that became smaller pieces that would then fit

11:49.360 --> 11:51.360
inside of the second trash can.

11:51.360 --> 11:52.360
I see.

11:52.360 --> 11:53.360
Let me tell you what.

11:53.360 --> 11:54.360
That's just recycling 101.

11:54.360 --> 11:56.360
I'll tell you what you don't do,

11:56.360 --> 11:57.360
because I've run into this before.

11:57.360 --> 11:58.360
You don't put the bigger can

11:58.360 --> 12:00.360
or the smaller can inside the bigger can,

12:00.360 --> 12:02.360
because then you run into the chance

12:02.360 --> 12:03.360
that someone opens it and goes,

12:03.360 --> 12:05.360
oh, this can is pregnant.

12:05.360 --> 12:06.360
I can't throw anything away in here.

12:06.360 --> 12:07.360
And they don't want to, yeah.

12:07.360 --> 12:11.360
Yeah, because this trash can is going to have a baby soon,

12:11.360 --> 12:13.360
and that's a problem.

12:13.360 --> 12:14.360
I solved it by moving,

12:14.360 --> 12:16.360
and I just left the old trash cans,

12:16.360 --> 12:18.360
and that's their problem now.

12:18.360 --> 12:20.360
And the other lesson I learned

12:20.360 --> 12:22.360
is that there's a few things in life

12:22.360 --> 12:24.360
that you should spend a little bit more money on,

12:24.360 --> 12:27.360
and number one on that list for me is,

12:27.360 --> 12:30.360
some things are disposable, and it doesn't matter.

12:30.360 --> 12:33.360
Get a wonderful trash can

12:33.360 --> 12:35.360
if you want to live with you forever.

12:35.360 --> 12:38.360
I cheaped out when I first moved into our first house,

12:38.360 --> 12:41.360
and I hated that trash can forever.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.360
I could never get rid of it.

12:42.360 --> 12:45.360
So next time, get yourself a great trash can,

12:45.360 --> 12:46.360
a trash can that does everything.

12:46.360 --> 12:50.360
Your family, your lover, your security blanket,

12:50.360 --> 12:51.360
whatever you need.

12:51.360 --> 12:53.360
Probably not your lover.

12:53.360 --> 12:54.360
Not your lover.

12:54.360 --> 12:55.360
Not your lover.

12:55.360 --> 12:57.360
But I guess that is how trash cans get pregnant.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.360
That is true.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.360
I have another solution you could try, though,

13:00.360 --> 13:01.360
that I didn't have the guts.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.360
Can I just say, to your point,

13:03.360 --> 13:04.360
can I just say real quick before you say the solution?

13:04.360 --> 13:05.360
Say anything.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.360
Get a trash can with good wheels.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.360
You need good wheel action.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.360
Invest in the wheels.

13:10.360 --> 13:12.360
Maybe get your own trucks for it.

13:12.360 --> 13:13.360
You know what I mean?

13:13.360 --> 13:16.360
Really get down there and lube them up if you need to.

13:16.360 --> 13:19.360
When we're born, we should all be assigned a thick,

13:19.360 --> 13:23.360
granite, unbreakable, sturdy trash can

13:23.360 --> 13:26.360
that is our trash can that we use for our life,

13:26.360 --> 13:28.360
and then when we die, we get ashtub into it,

13:28.360 --> 13:33.360
and then it is our literal constant companion into eternity.

13:33.360 --> 13:35.360
That's what happens in the giver.

13:35.360 --> 13:37.360
Yes, that's basically what the giver's about.

13:37.360 --> 13:39.360
Here's one that I think you should try.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.360
Get a can of spray paint,

13:42.360 --> 13:48.360
and spray paint this is trash on yourself,

13:48.360 --> 13:53.360
and that'll remind you to spray paint this is trash on the can,

13:53.360 --> 13:54.360
so it's kind of a reminder.

13:54.360 --> 13:56.360
You know that doesn't help, though, right, Juice?

13:56.360 --> 13:57.360
Right.

13:57.360 --> 14:00.360
If I see a trash can that says this is trash on it,

14:00.360 --> 14:03.360
I will think, yep, that is where the trash goes.

14:03.360 --> 14:04.360
Fuck.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.360
Fuck, you're right.

14:06.360 --> 14:08.360
I think it would be way more confusing

14:08.360 --> 14:11.360
if you had to write on trash cans you didn't want to throw away.

14:11.360 --> 14:14.360
This isn't trash, because then if I,

14:14.360 --> 14:16.360
the sanitation worker, come along and see it,

14:16.360 --> 14:18.360
I think, well, I guess I leave that one alone?

14:18.360 --> 14:20.360
I think every town should have a volcano in it.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.360
Okay.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.360
Because I think that there's a,

14:22.360 --> 14:25.360
I think there's a, we have a few cans here in Austin.

14:25.360 --> 14:28.360
I got a compost bin, got a recycling,

14:28.360 --> 14:32.360
and I got a little garbage can, and that's all great,

14:32.360 --> 14:34.360
but then there's stuff like other trash cans.

14:34.360 --> 14:37.360
There's stuff like, you know, electronics.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.360
I don't know if that's great to put in there,

14:39.360 --> 14:41.360
something with like a big battery in it, no thanks.

14:41.360 --> 14:44.360
Fucking oil, when you get oil out of the pan,

14:44.360 --> 14:46.360
I'm still not quite sure what people are supposed to do with that.

14:46.360 --> 14:48.360
We should have volcano.

14:48.360 --> 14:50.360
And you can't use it all the time.

14:50.360 --> 14:51.360
You obviously have to drive to volcano,

14:51.360 --> 14:53.360
but like, that's where you throw trash can into.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.360
That's where you throw your old oil into.

14:55.360 --> 14:56.360
That's where you throw your-

14:56.360 --> 14:57.360
Batteries.

14:57.360 --> 14:58.360
Batteries go right into volcano.

14:58.360 --> 14:59.360
Obviously.

14:59.360 --> 15:00.360
Yeah.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.360
And it's perfect, because all it does,

15:02.360 --> 15:03.360
I guess it just goes down in the earth.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.360
Like, volcano's not going to overflow

15:05.360 --> 15:07.360
because of something you did.

15:07.360 --> 15:09.360
That's the trash truck.

15:09.360 --> 15:11.360
The trash truck is outside right now as we're talking.

15:11.360 --> 15:12.360
Oh, boy.

15:12.360 --> 15:13.360
I'm going to go yell at Dan.

15:13.360 --> 15:15.360
Hold up.

15:15.360 --> 15:17.360
Hey, you guys should do a volcano.

15:17.360 --> 15:22.360
For garbage cans to go in.

15:22.360 --> 15:24.360
And electronics and oil.

15:24.360 --> 15:26.360
They're laughing, guys.

15:26.360 --> 15:27.360
They're busting the fuck up.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.360
Are they laughing at it?

15:28.360 --> 15:30.360
They thought that was fucking hilarious.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.360
Do you guys want to hear Yahoo?

15:32.360 --> 15:34.360
But they're not going to take it seriously?

15:34.360 --> 15:37.360
No, they laughed in a serious way.

15:37.360 --> 15:39.360
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

15:39.360 --> 15:40.360
Thank you, Adrian.

15:40.360 --> 15:42.360
It's Yahoo Answers user anonymous.

15:42.360 --> 15:45.360
I'm going to call Travis.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.360
No, what?

15:47.360 --> 15:48.360
Travis asked this.

15:48.360 --> 15:50.360
Travis McRoy asked,

15:50.360 --> 15:53.360
okay to take all the pepperoni from the pizza?

15:53.360 --> 15:55.360
I love pepperoni on my pizza.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.360
So while at my neighbor's house,

15:56.360 --> 15:58.360
I picked all the pepperonis off,

15:58.360 --> 16:02.360
and I put it on my slices.

16:02.360 --> 16:03.360
I figured, I like it, so why not?

16:03.360 --> 16:05.360
Well, my rude neighbor said,

16:05.360 --> 16:07.360
I guess I'll have cheese pizza.

16:07.360 --> 16:08.360
What's this guy's problem?

16:08.360 --> 16:10.360
You're supposed to please your guest, right?

16:10.360 --> 16:12.360
Some people really shouldn't entertain.

16:12.360 --> 16:14.360
Whoa.

16:14.360 --> 16:16.360
Whoa, that went places.

16:16.360 --> 16:17.360
So what's the question?

16:17.360 --> 16:20.360
Is it okay to take the pepperonis off the pizza

16:20.360 --> 16:21.360
and put it on my slices?

16:21.360 --> 16:24.360
All of it?

16:24.360 --> 16:27.360
It says all of it, yeah.

16:27.360 --> 16:28.360
I picked all the pepperonis.

16:28.360 --> 16:29.360
Okay, at a certain point.

16:29.360 --> 16:30.360
Yeah.

16:30.360 --> 16:34.360
And even getting out of the realm of manners,

16:34.360 --> 16:36.360
or etiquette, or whatever,

16:36.360 --> 16:43.360
to overload one slice with all of the pepperonis is obscene.

16:43.360 --> 16:45.360
There's no obscene amount of pepperonis.

16:45.360 --> 16:46.360
Yeah.

16:46.360 --> 16:48.360
You go to eat it, and it'd be like,

16:48.360 --> 16:51.360
it's piled with them discs.

16:51.360 --> 16:52.360
That's too much, yeah.

16:52.360 --> 16:53.360
And you're going to get upset.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.360
Tommy, I do love pepperoni though, damn.

16:55.360 --> 16:57.360
I think the problem is putting all the pepperonis

16:57.360 --> 17:00.360
on either one slice that you're going to eat

17:00.360 --> 17:02.360
or your half of the pizza.

17:02.360 --> 17:04.360
I think if you are going to rearrange them,

17:04.360 --> 17:06.360
you slide the pepperonis around

17:06.360 --> 17:10.360
so that it's every other slice has double the pepperonis

17:10.360 --> 17:12.360
from its adjacent, let's say, one to the left slice

17:12.360 --> 17:13.360
gets moved all over to it.

17:13.360 --> 17:15.360
And then whenever you're eating the pizza,

17:15.360 --> 17:18.360
you just prioritize those pieces.

17:18.360 --> 17:19.360
Do you know what I mean?

17:19.360 --> 17:23.360
And so maybe you'll get away with it that way.

17:23.360 --> 17:25.360
They'll almost certainly eat

17:25.360 --> 17:27.360
one of the heavy pepperoni slices,

17:27.360 --> 17:29.360
but you're going to be ahead of the game.

17:29.360 --> 17:32.360
Can I just say how much I enjoy Neighbor,

17:32.360 --> 17:34.360
who, if I understood the question correctly,

17:34.360 --> 17:36.360
it was their party?

17:36.360 --> 17:40.360
And says, I guess I'll have cheese pizza?

17:40.360 --> 17:41.360
Mm-hmm.

17:41.360 --> 17:44.360
And the other person's like, how rude.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.360
It's like, well, hold on.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.360
It's like you stabbed him, and he said,

17:48.360 --> 17:49.360
well, I guess I'll just bleed to death.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.360
And you're like, jerk.

17:51.360 --> 17:52.360
I love that those two things

17:52.360 --> 17:54.360
are equivalent in Travis's mind.

17:54.360 --> 17:57.360
Not exactly the same, but they're close.

17:57.360 --> 18:00.360
Is it, do you, if you are a guest at someone's home

18:00.360 --> 18:01.360
and they serve you pizza

18:01.360 --> 18:05.360
that they have either purchased or prepared,

18:05.360 --> 18:07.360
and you do the thing with the napkin

18:07.360 --> 18:09.360
where you blot up all the grease off the pizza.

18:09.360 --> 18:10.360
So rude.

18:10.360 --> 18:12.360
That's rude, right?

18:12.360 --> 18:14.360
I remember the first time I saw someone do this

18:14.360 --> 18:16.360
and I loudly announced that they had ruined pizza forever

18:16.360 --> 18:17.360
for everyone.

18:17.360 --> 18:18.360
Yeah.

18:18.360 --> 18:21.360
But eventually, every once in a while, you got to.

18:21.360 --> 18:22.360
It's not dirt.

18:22.360 --> 18:23.360
It's not dirt.

18:23.360 --> 18:25.360
It's oil that the pizza sweated out

18:25.360 --> 18:28.360
when it got cooked like that.

18:28.360 --> 18:30.360
Do you think it's rude if I went to a party

18:30.360 --> 18:32.360
and someone's serving pizza,

18:32.360 --> 18:34.360
and I folded it in half,

18:34.360 --> 18:36.360
and then folded it in half again.

18:36.360 --> 18:37.360
So I had like one big triangle.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.360
And you kept doing that until it disappeared?

18:39.360 --> 18:40.360
Yeah.

18:40.360 --> 18:41.360
Is that rude?

18:41.360 --> 18:42.360
Yeah.

18:42.360 --> 18:43.360
Is that rude?

18:43.360 --> 18:44.360
Yeah, cause some people would, I get it.

18:44.360 --> 18:45.360
It was an amazing trick.

18:45.360 --> 18:46.360
I've never seen anything like it in my life,

18:46.360 --> 18:48.360
but there are people who want to eat it.

18:48.360 --> 18:49.360
But see, but then here's the thing.

18:49.360 --> 18:53.360
The prestige is later they drive home

18:53.360 --> 18:56.360
and they go to get their nightgown out of their drawers.

18:56.360 --> 18:57.360
They open their drawer.

18:57.360 --> 19:02.360
There's the whole pizza sitting there with nary a crease.

19:02.360 --> 19:03.360
That's good.

19:03.360 --> 19:05.360
That's the, now is it still rude?

19:05.360 --> 19:07.360
No, now it's cool.

19:07.360 --> 19:09.360
There you go.

19:09.360 --> 19:15.360
This is obviously a profoundly bad thing to do.

19:15.360 --> 19:19.360
I think that you have maybe a misunderstanding

19:19.360 --> 19:23.360
of the sort of host-guest relationship.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.360
Yes.

19:24.360 --> 19:28.360
If I prepare dinner for you when you come to my house,

19:28.360 --> 19:32.360
you need to eat it even if it is nasty, muddy, shitty garbage.

19:32.360 --> 19:33.360
Do you know what I mean?

19:33.360 --> 19:34.360
Yeah.

19:34.360 --> 19:35.360
And you don't get to complain about it.

19:35.360 --> 19:37.360
You're supposed to, you do eat it.

19:37.360 --> 19:39.360
I want to make you feel comfortable in my home,

19:39.360 --> 19:42.360
but I will not accept any notes or criticism

19:42.360 --> 19:44.360
about how I decide to go about doing that.

19:44.360 --> 19:46.360
Now, hold on, now I am confused

19:46.360 --> 19:49.360
because I thought the question asker went to someone else's home.

19:49.360 --> 19:50.360
Yes.

19:50.360 --> 19:52.360
Took all the pepperoni off of the pizza

19:52.360 --> 19:54.360
and applied it to one slice.

19:54.360 --> 19:57.360
And then the homeowner, the host, said,

19:57.360 --> 20:00.360
I guess I'll just eat cheese pizza.

20:00.360 --> 20:03.360
So, but that is the thing of like,

20:03.360 --> 20:07.360
how far does the host need to go to please the guest?

20:07.360 --> 20:10.360
If I'm the guest and I'm like, your TV's nicer than mine,

20:10.360 --> 20:11.360
I'm going to take it.

20:11.360 --> 20:12.360
Fair.

20:12.360 --> 20:15.360
Because I want you to be a good host and I'm the guest.

20:15.360 --> 20:18.360
And this is my plasma now.

20:18.360 --> 20:20.360
You can't take your host's plasma though.

20:20.360 --> 20:21.360
No, they need that.

20:21.360 --> 20:22.360
They need that to live.

20:22.360 --> 20:24.360
Well, no, you put that in a centrifuge

20:24.360 --> 20:27.360
and you can just fill it with saline and put that back in.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.360
Yeah.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.360
Travis is a doctor, so.

20:30.360 --> 20:31.360
Yep.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.360
I think for me-

20:32.360 --> 20:35.360
I needed beer money a couple of times at college

20:35.360 --> 20:37.360
and here we are.

20:37.360 --> 20:39.360
But okay, what if I, as the guest, say,

20:39.360 --> 20:41.360
I'm not that hungry, I'm just going to have one slice,

20:41.360 --> 20:44.360
but also, and then I throw the rest of the pizza

20:44.360 --> 20:46.360
in the garbage because I'm like,

20:46.360 --> 20:48.360
but I don't want you to have any either.

20:48.360 --> 20:51.360
And as the guest, what I say goes.

20:51.360 --> 20:52.360
That's gonna be cool.

20:52.360 --> 20:55.360
You could pull out a big, stinky, dirty, old bag

20:55.360 --> 20:58.360
of your own pepperoni from like your jacket pocket

20:58.360 --> 21:00.360
and like open it up and be like,

21:00.360 --> 21:04.360
oh, I was gonna load up my slices with this sweet red meat.

21:04.360 --> 21:05.360
God, I love this stuff so much,

21:05.360 --> 21:08.360
but oh, smell this bag of pepperoni I brought.

21:08.360 --> 21:09.360
That's not good anymore.

21:09.360 --> 21:12.360
But fuck, I do need to eat a lot of pepperoni today.

21:12.360 --> 21:16.360
My doctor said, oh well, I guess I'll start shuffle,

21:16.360 --> 21:18.360
shuffle up and deal.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.360
Oh, smell this meat.

21:19.360 --> 21:21.360
Oh my God, no.

21:21.360 --> 21:23.360
If only there was some other way.

21:23.360 --> 21:25.360
Do you want to just take the rest of the pepperoni

21:25.360 --> 21:27.360
off the pizza?

21:27.360 --> 21:30.360
I mean, it is for medicine, so.

21:30.360 --> 21:33.360
I mean, I would hate for you to die.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.360
Yeah, I will, and I will.

21:35.360 --> 21:38.360
I guess I'll just have cheese pizza.

21:38.360 --> 21:41.360
Let me go rinse off my stinky bag of pepperoni in the sink

21:41.360 --> 21:43.360
and see if that, nope, it's not helping.

21:43.360 --> 21:46.360
It still smells bad.

21:46.360 --> 21:48.360
Announcement, I have a new segment for the show.

21:48.360 --> 21:49.360
Oh.

21:49.360 --> 21:55.360
Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no.

21:55.360 --> 22:03.360
This is the tick tock, tick tock, the don't, tick tock,

22:03.360 --> 22:05.360
come on, there's something there, come on.

22:05.360 --> 22:08.360
Tick tock o'clock, tick tock o'clock.

22:08.360 --> 22:09.360
Okay, there we go.

22:09.360 --> 22:10.360
Sucks.

22:10.360 --> 22:11.360
I know it's there.

22:11.360 --> 22:12.360
Tick tock o'clock.

22:12.360 --> 22:16.360
Weirdly, for no reason that I can discern,

22:16.360 --> 22:19.360
clips of our show have become popular on the social video

22:19.360 --> 22:22.360
sharing app, Tick tock, which I describe like that

22:22.360 --> 22:25.360
because I am 39 years old.

22:25.360 --> 22:28.360
I don't know how to find these videos.

22:28.360 --> 22:30.360
I have to be shown them.

22:30.360 --> 22:32.360
This is a way that other grownups can see these,

22:32.360 --> 22:37.360
is have your sister-in-law Riley show you.

22:37.360 --> 22:38.360
Yep.

22:38.360 --> 22:41.360
And she will show you the tick tocks if you want to see them,

22:41.360 --> 22:45.360
but these clips of our show, illegally, but that's fine.

22:45.360 --> 22:47.360
And I want to, here's what I wanted to do.

22:47.360 --> 22:50.360
They take our sound and then they put new video to them

22:50.360 --> 22:53.360
and help craft a tapestry.

22:53.360 --> 22:56.360
And they have had to make do with what we've already done.

22:56.360 --> 22:57.360
Yeah.

22:57.360 --> 22:58.360
Unintentionally, for not that.

22:58.360 --> 23:00.360
For not that.

23:00.360 --> 23:03.360
So what Tick tock o'clock is about

23:03.360 --> 23:07.360
is we are going to be creating some sounds

23:07.360 --> 23:12.360
that they can then repurpose into like a cogent narrative.

23:12.360 --> 23:16.360
Some bespoke tick tock content.

23:16.360 --> 23:18.360
The rules are this.

23:18.360 --> 23:21.360
One of us will begin, the other two must answer.

23:21.360 --> 23:23.360
It can either relate or not relate,

23:23.360 --> 23:25.360
but it's just three lines

23:25.360 --> 23:27.360
because we got to keep the tick tock snappy.

23:27.360 --> 23:30.360
I think they can only be like eight or nine seconds.

23:30.360 --> 23:32.360
Like, I think they can be like a minute.

23:32.360 --> 23:33.360
I've seen some pretty long ones.

23:33.360 --> 23:36.360
Are we trying to create a narrative?

23:36.360 --> 23:39.360
It's not incumbent on us to create a narrative.

23:39.360 --> 23:41.360
Okay, great, great, great.

23:41.360 --> 23:42.360
Okay.

23:42.360 --> 23:43.360
Justin, you begin and I'll respond

23:43.360 --> 23:45.360
and then Griffin can finish up.

23:45.360 --> 23:47.360
Okay.

23:47.360 --> 23:50.360
Hey guys, I got a brand new Wendy's life hack for you.

23:50.360 --> 23:53.360
Wait till you see this, you're going to lose your mind.

23:53.360 --> 23:55.360
I'm sorry, I can't.

23:55.360 --> 23:57.360
Has anyone seen my pants?

23:57.360 --> 24:01.360
A spaghetti for sale?

24:01.360 --> 24:02.360
See, that's a good tick tock.

24:02.360 --> 24:03.360
Yeah?

24:03.360 --> 24:04.360
That's funny to me.

24:04.360 --> 24:05.360
That's a good tick tock.

24:05.360 --> 24:06.360
Okay, Griffin, you start one.

24:06.360 --> 24:08.360
Okay.

24:08.360 --> 24:10.360
It can be like, hey everybody,

24:10.360 --> 24:12.360
I have a hot new makeup tutorial for you.

24:12.360 --> 24:14.360
It goes something like this.

24:14.360 --> 24:15.360
Oh, Travis and I should have discussed.

24:15.360 --> 24:17.360
Oh yeah, I just assumed you'd go next.

24:17.360 --> 24:19.360
Okay, okay.

24:19.360 --> 24:21.360
Give it to me again, give it to me again.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.360
Hey everybody, I have a hot new makeup tutorial.

24:23.360 --> 24:25.360
I think you're just going to love it.

24:25.360 --> 24:27.360
First you eat the sponge and then...

24:27.360 --> 24:30.360
No, hold on, because teens are going to eat the sponges, Justin.

24:30.360 --> 24:31.360
Don't eat the...

24:31.360 --> 24:33.360
And I need a little bit more than that, Justin.

24:33.360 --> 24:34.360
Yeah, you're right, Travis.

24:34.360 --> 24:35.360
You're right, Travis.

24:35.360 --> 24:37.360
I'm so sorry, Griffin, give it to me one more time.

24:37.360 --> 24:41.360
Hey everybody, here comes a hot new makeup tutorial for you.

24:41.360 --> 24:45.360
First you don't eat the sponge and then you wait.

24:45.360 --> 24:47.360
Anyways, here's some Walking Dead spoilers.

24:47.360 --> 24:55.360
I think we could do one more.

24:55.360 --> 24:56.360
Yeah?

24:56.360 --> 24:59.360
Trav, you can kind of start at tapestry.

24:59.360 --> 25:00.360
Okay.

25:00.360 --> 25:01.360
And then we'll weave it,

25:01.360 --> 25:03.360
so it'll be more TikTok appropriate.

25:03.360 --> 25:04.360
Oh, okay.

25:04.360 --> 25:09.360
Hey, you guys need to get ready or we're going to be late

25:09.360 --> 25:12.360
for Derek's birthday party at Mickey D's.

25:12.360 --> 25:15.360
I don't have a strapless dress, so I'm going to cut up my socks.

25:15.360 --> 25:17.360
Spaghetti for sale.

25:17.360 --> 25:19.360
Spaghetti strapless dress, you mean?

25:19.360 --> 25:21.360
These dogs are barking.

25:21.360 --> 25:23.360
Shit, fuck, we talked all over each other.

25:23.360 --> 25:24.360
We really fucked that one up, guys.

25:24.360 --> 25:26.360
That's going to be a good one though.

25:26.360 --> 25:28.360
So any one of those you want to use TikTokers,

25:28.360 --> 25:30.360
God, I hope you call yourselves that.

25:30.360 --> 25:31.360
No.

25:31.360 --> 25:32.360
Fuck.

25:32.360 --> 25:33.360
I think it's TikTokists.

25:33.360 --> 25:35.360
TikTok.

25:35.360 --> 25:38.360
That's been TikTok o'clock.

25:38.360 --> 25:41.360
How about another question?

25:41.360 --> 25:42.360
Yes.

25:42.360 --> 25:43.360
Is that the way to go?

25:43.360 --> 25:44.360
Yes.

25:44.360 --> 25:48.360
I opened my mail to find a birthday card from my Grammy Kern.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.360
It was very sweet.

25:50.360 --> 25:54.360
She included a check written out to me for $100.

25:54.360 --> 25:55.360
Holy shit.

25:55.360 --> 25:57.360
There is one problem though.

25:57.360 --> 25:59.360
I have no idea who Grammy Kern is,

25:59.360 --> 26:01.360
and my birthday is not in April.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.360
Huh.

26:02.360 --> 26:03.360
Both?

26:03.360 --> 26:04.360
What?

26:04.360 --> 26:05.360
Whoa.

26:05.360 --> 26:09.360
Both the card and the check have my correct name

26:09.360 --> 26:11.360
and address on it.

26:11.360 --> 26:14.360
I've tried to find Grammy Kern on Facebook,

26:14.360 --> 26:16.360
but had no such luck.

26:16.360 --> 26:17.360
What should I do here?

26:17.360 --> 26:19.360
Would it be wrong to attempt to cash the check,

26:19.360 --> 26:20.360
or do I throw it away?

26:20.360 --> 26:23.360
$100 would be really nice in these trying times,

26:23.360 --> 26:25.360
but is it the right thing to do?

26:25.360 --> 26:27.360
Please help vexed in Virginia.

26:27.360 --> 26:28.360
Fuck.

26:28.360 --> 26:30.360
It is made out to you.

26:30.360 --> 26:32.360
That's a doozy though.

26:32.360 --> 26:34.360
It's got your correct name and address on it.

26:34.360 --> 26:39.360
So the only logical thing, this person knows who you are,

26:39.360 --> 26:40.360
even if you don't know who they are.

26:40.360 --> 26:43.360
So they have decided to give you $100

26:43.360 --> 26:46.360
knowing who you are and where you live.

26:46.360 --> 26:47.360
I think you're good.

26:47.360 --> 26:50.360
Oh, but there's a risk here

26:50.360 --> 26:55.360
that this is some kind of strange social contract kind of catfish

26:55.360 --> 26:57.360
where you accept the $100,

26:57.360 --> 26:58.360
and then they roll up and like,

26:58.360 --> 27:01.360
hey, I need to stay with you for like a week

27:01.360 --> 27:02.360
while my place gets renovated.

27:02.360 --> 27:03.360
And you're like, well, you can't.

27:03.360 --> 27:06.360
Whoa, you didn't seem to think you didn't know me

27:06.360 --> 27:08.360
when you cashed my $100 check.

27:08.360 --> 27:12.360
Ooh, that's a legitimate concern.

27:12.360 --> 27:14.360
See, I was going to say there was a worry

27:14.360 --> 27:19.360
that maybe your name is like Dylan Smith or something,

27:19.360 --> 27:21.360
and she just like Googled Dylan Smith

27:21.360 --> 27:23.360
and somebody had fully, fully doxxed you,

27:23.360 --> 27:26.360
and she just wrote a check to the first Dylan Smith

27:26.360 --> 27:27.360
she found at Google.

27:27.360 --> 27:29.360
I mean, I guess that's possible,

27:29.360 --> 27:34.360
but I'm going to go more with the weird catfishing thing

27:34.360 --> 27:36.360
of just needing a place to stay for a week.

27:36.360 --> 27:38.360
It does feel that way, right?

27:38.360 --> 27:40.360
Like if you cash it, then they get your like,

27:40.360 --> 27:42.360
I don't know what information,

27:42.360 --> 27:45.360
like how eager you were to cash it,

27:45.360 --> 27:47.360
and they can use that to start to build a profile.

27:47.360 --> 27:49.360
Well, this feels a little bit like, you know,

27:49.360 --> 27:52.360
if you push this button, I'll give you a million dollars,

27:52.360 --> 27:54.360
but someone somewhere will die.

27:54.360 --> 27:56.360
Someone on ours will die, and it will be Grammy Kern.

27:56.360 --> 27:57.360
And it'll be Grammy Kern.

27:57.360 --> 27:59.360
Cash this check, that's $103,

27:59.360 --> 28:04.360
but just you will have to pay for it in some form

28:04.360 --> 28:09.360
or function down the line, and the juice is running.

28:09.360 --> 28:11.360
I do need to know more about what the birthday card said,

28:11.360 --> 28:13.360
because if they were more pertinent,

28:13.360 --> 28:17.360
and it could be something like Dear Vex in Virginia

28:17.360 --> 28:22.360
with red hair and the shirt that has an elephant on it,

28:22.360 --> 28:24.360
and they are describing the shirt you wear every day

28:24.360 --> 28:26.360
that has an elephant on it, I guess,

28:26.360 --> 28:29.360
because this is like Doug, and you wear the same outfit

28:29.360 --> 28:30.360
every day.

28:30.360 --> 28:33.360
But you have Auburn hair, and you're like, hmm.

28:33.360 --> 28:34.360
Ah, fuck.

28:34.360 --> 28:35.360
Could this be me?

28:35.360 --> 28:37.360
Or what if it said inside, like, from Grammy Kern,

28:37.360 --> 28:41.360
I wish you were my grandkid, because my real grandkid sucks.

28:41.360 --> 28:46.360
Every year, I choose someone at random to send $100 to

28:46.360 --> 28:49.360
instead of my grandkid who I do not like.

28:49.360 --> 28:51.360
Who sucks this year to see you.

28:51.360 --> 28:53.360
Congratulations.

28:53.360 --> 28:55.360
You send a card to the grandkid, and it's like,

28:55.360 --> 28:57.360
I did it again. Sorry.

28:57.360 --> 28:58.360
Ah!

28:58.360 --> 29:01.360
I need you to spend this on Beyblades

29:01.360 --> 29:04.360
and send pictures of yourself with your Beyblades

29:04.360 --> 29:06.360
to my dipshit grandson Dylan.

29:06.360 --> 29:08.360
Here's his Instagram handle.

29:08.360 --> 29:10.360
Really tear him the fuck up.

29:10.360 --> 29:12.360
Throw the Beyblades in the garbage can

29:12.360 --> 29:14.360
and make him watch.

29:14.360 --> 29:16.360
Love, Grammy Kern.

29:16.360 --> 29:21.360
Let's take a break and head on into the Money Zone

29:21.360 --> 29:23.360
so we can buy Beyblades.

29:23.360 --> 29:35.360
Hey, Justin and Griffin.

29:35.360 --> 29:36.360
Yep.

29:36.360 --> 29:39.360
Do you like to be entertained?

29:39.360 --> 29:41.360
Yeah, bud.

29:41.360 --> 29:42.360
Yeah, you do.

29:42.360 --> 29:44.360
Then I bet you like Audible.

29:44.360 --> 29:46.360
Audible has so much to offer you.

29:46.360 --> 29:48.360
You gotta stop gyrating your hips

29:48.360 --> 29:49.360
while you're talking about this, Travis.

29:49.360 --> 29:50.360
I can't, buddy.

29:50.360 --> 29:51.360
The way you're doing it.

29:51.360 --> 29:53.360
We got some free time nowadays

29:53.360 --> 29:56.360
as we're spending a lot more time safely indoors,

29:56.360 --> 30:00.360
and it's time that you were entertained.

30:00.360 --> 30:02.360
The hip gyration, Travis.

30:02.360 --> 30:03.360
I'm begging you, bud.

30:03.360 --> 30:05.360
I'm begging you, bud.

30:05.360 --> 30:08.360
Please sit down in a chair if you have to.

30:08.360 --> 30:09.360
Oh, I'm doing it in a chair over.

30:09.360 --> 30:10.360
Not backwards.

30:10.360 --> 30:12.360
Audible is the leading provider

30:12.360 --> 30:14.360
of spoken word entertainment and audio books,

30:14.360 --> 30:17.360
Audible Originals, Daily News Digest,

30:17.360 --> 30:20.360
and soothing audio experiences.

30:20.360 --> 30:21.360
You're sweating so much.

30:21.360 --> 30:22.360
Like, how are you doing that?

30:22.360 --> 30:24.360
Like, you're making the sweat come out fast.

30:24.360 --> 30:25.360
Oh, yeah.

30:25.360 --> 30:29.360
Audible is entertaining.

30:29.360 --> 30:30.360
Can I tell you?

30:30.360 --> 30:31.360
Okay, listen.

30:31.360 --> 30:35.360
All gyrating aside, there is a really, really wonderful-

30:35.360 --> 30:38.360
It's my favorite NPR show every Sunday morning.

30:38.360 --> 30:39.360
All gyrations considered.

30:39.360 --> 30:40.360
I put my feet up.

30:40.360 --> 30:43.360
There is a wonderful kind of, I guess, series.

30:43.360 --> 30:46.360
It's like a podcast series on Audible

30:46.360 --> 30:48.360
that is narrated by Stephen Fry,

30:48.360 --> 30:50.360
and it's called Victorian Secrets,

30:50.360 --> 30:53.360
and it's all about the seedy underbelly

30:53.360 --> 30:57.360
of the Victorian era, and it is so good,

30:57.360 --> 30:59.360
and it's got this amazing sound design,

30:59.360 --> 31:04.360
and there's actors playing Victorian-era people.

31:04.360 --> 31:06.360
It is wonderful.

31:06.360 --> 31:07.360
Badass.

31:07.360 --> 31:10.360
Yeah, Teresa and I could not stop listening to it,

31:10.360 --> 31:15.360
and listen, I've been a big fan of audio books forever,

31:15.360 --> 31:19.360
and so I've been an Audible subscriber for as long as I can remember,

31:19.360 --> 31:22.360
but there's so much more than audio books, you know?

31:22.360 --> 31:24.360
They've got podcasts, news, all kinds of things there,

31:24.360 --> 31:26.360
so if you haven't checked out Audible in a while,

31:26.360 --> 31:27.360
you have to go.

31:27.360 --> 31:30.360
Go to audible.com slash brother,

31:30.360 --> 31:35.360
or text brother to 500500.

31:35.360 --> 31:40.360
That's audible.com slash brother.

31:40.360 --> 31:41.360
Me and Andy's back again,

31:41.360 --> 31:44.360
and they have the softest dang underwear and other stuff

31:44.360 --> 31:46.360
in the whole wide world.

31:46.360 --> 31:47.360
They are softer than soft.

31:47.360 --> 31:49.360
They are sustainable, these underpants,

31:49.360 --> 31:54.360
and they do have fun prints with unicorns, mermaids,

31:54.360 --> 31:59.360
cool colors, dots and stripes, all kinds of great stuff.

31:59.360 --> 32:00.360
I'm wearing some right now.

32:00.360 --> 32:02.360
These ones have little peace signs on them,

32:02.360 --> 32:05.360
but they're a bunch of different colors, and I love that.

32:05.360 --> 32:08.360
They also got a monthly subscription membership service

32:08.360 --> 32:11.360
that will send you new pairs right to your house

32:11.360 --> 32:14.360
or apartment or whatever,

32:14.360 --> 32:19.360
and you can have just a whole underwear drawer full of fun,

32:19.360 --> 32:22.360
and you also get some site-wide savings

32:22.360 --> 32:24.360
and exclusive sales with this here membership.

32:24.360 --> 32:28.360
They also have matching pairs if you have a love or a friend

32:28.360 --> 32:31.360
who you want to maybe step over some boundaries with,

32:31.360 --> 32:35.360
and you can share the same underwear designs with them.

32:35.360 --> 32:40.360
You can get a range of sizes from extra small to 4XL,

32:40.360 --> 32:44.360
and I cannot vouch for these underwear and other things enough.

32:44.360 --> 32:46.360
You can get 15% off your first order, free shipping,

32:46.360 --> 32:48.360
and a 100% satisfaction guarantee

32:48.360 --> 32:51.360
by going to meundies.com slash my brother, all one word.

32:51.360 --> 32:53.360
That's meundies.com slash my brother.

32:56.360 --> 32:58.360
Hey, I'm Mallory O'Mara, a weird fiction reader

32:58.360 --> 33:01.360
who enjoys whiskey and owns a book weight.

33:01.360 --> 33:03.360
And I'm Bria Grant, a science fiction reader

33:03.360 --> 33:06.360
who likes iced tea and reads to escape the world.

33:06.360 --> 33:08.360
And we host Reading Glasses, a weekly show

33:08.360 --> 33:11.360
that dives into reading suggestions, goals, complaints,

33:11.360 --> 33:13.360
and the really important questions,

33:13.360 --> 33:15.360
like what are the best reading snacks?

33:15.360 --> 33:17.360
And seriously, Mallory, what is a book weight for?

33:17.360 --> 33:19.360
Every week, we talk about reading.

33:19.360 --> 33:20.360
It's not a book club.

33:20.360 --> 33:23.360
You're not going to have to listen to us review a book you haven't read.

33:23.360 --> 33:25.360
You just have to be excited about books, authors,

33:25.360 --> 33:27.360
the bookish community, writing, and talking about reading.

33:27.360 --> 33:30.360
We can literally talk about reading, like, all day long.

33:30.360 --> 33:31.360
Reading Glasses.

33:31.360 --> 33:33.360
Every Thursday on MaximumFun.org.

33:33.360 --> 33:34.360
Glasses.

33:34.360 --> 33:39.360
I thought about doing that.

33:39.360 --> 33:40.360
Let's see here.

33:40.360 --> 33:42.360
I got another question.

33:42.360 --> 33:44.360
I recently decided to get good at roller skating

33:44.360 --> 33:47.360
after 19 years of clinging to the walls at the rink.

33:47.360 --> 33:49.360
One of the things that has helped me so much

33:49.360 --> 33:51.360
has been instructional videos online.

33:51.360 --> 33:53.360
A lot of these videos take place in the skate park

33:53.360 --> 33:57.360
and show really cool tricks on ramps and bowls and stuff.

33:57.360 --> 34:01.360
It has inspired me to eventually try and skate at the park.

34:01.360 --> 34:04.360
However, when I've gone to check out the skate parks in my area,

34:04.360 --> 34:08.360
there are usually a few or many skateboarders there.

34:08.360 --> 34:11.360
I'm scared I'll be made fun of for roller skating there

34:11.360 --> 34:12.360
instead of skateboarding.

34:12.360 --> 34:14.360
How do I intimidate the skateboarders

34:14.360 --> 34:17.360
and take my rightful place as alpha of the park

34:17.360 --> 34:18.360
so I don't get made fun of?

34:18.360 --> 34:22.360
That's from Scared of Skaters in Tennessee.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.360
You know, can I be honest with you guys?

34:24.360 --> 34:27.360
I don't know that we're equipped to answer this question,

34:27.360 --> 34:30.360
but when I think of skateboarders and skate parks,

34:30.360 --> 34:32.360
you know who I think of?

34:32.360 --> 34:33.360
Who, Travis?

34:33.360 --> 34:34.360
Hank Green.

34:34.360 --> 34:35.360
Yeah.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.360
Oh, he's a lifelong grinder.

34:37.360 --> 34:40.360
Yeah, they call him Hank Shredder Green.

34:40.360 --> 34:41.360
Hank Shredder Green.

34:41.360 --> 34:43.360
I bet if you think on that for 30 seconds

34:43.360 --> 34:44.360
while I'm talking about other things,

34:44.360 --> 34:46.360
you'll come up with something better.

34:46.360 --> 34:48.360
I'll give you a little breathing room,

34:48.360 --> 34:50.360
and I'll give Hank on-

34:50.360 --> 34:51.360
Grindr Green?

34:51.360 --> 34:52.360
That's nothing.

34:52.360 --> 34:53.360
I'm gonna give him a-

34:53.360 --> 34:54.360
That's not it.

34:54.360 --> 34:55.360
Green-der.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.360
Tony Hank.

34:56.360 --> 35:03.360
That was it, we found it, it was Tony Hank.

35:03.360 --> 35:04.360
It's ringing.

35:04.360 --> 35:05.360
Hello!

35:05.360 --> 35:06.360
Shit, it went to voicemail.

35:06.360 --> 35:09.360
Hello, no, it's me.

35:09.360 --> 35:12.360
No, it's still part of the voicemail.

35:12.360 --> 35:13.360
This is still part of the trick.

35:13.360 --> 35:14.360
Let me call him again.

35:14.360 --> 35:17.360
Oh, I fooled you, it was just voicemail the whole time.

35:17.360 --> 35:18.360
I knew it.

35:18.360 --> 35:20.360
Okay, I'm hanging up, I'm trying again.

35:20.360 --> 35:22.360
I'll do a speed redial.

35:22.360 --> 35:24.360
Hi there, brothers.

35:24.360 --> 35:25.360
It's me, Hank Green.

35:25.360 --> 35:26.360
It's me, Hank Green.

35:26.360 --> 35:28.360
Hank, were you screaming your calls?

35:28.360 --> 35:29.360
You didn't take-

35:29.360 --> 35:32.360
Well, you're not in my phone bank,

35:32.360 --> 35:33.360
whatever they call that.

35:33.360 --> 35:34.360
Oh.

35:34.360 --> 35:36.360
I think they called the Hank Bank.

35:36.360 --> 35:37.360
Yep.

35:37.360 --> 35:38.360
That's right.

35:38.360 --> 35:42.360
Hey, I don't wanna distract you

35:42.360 --> 35:45.360
because I know that a beautifully foolish endeavor,

35:45.360 --> 35:47.360
your new book comes out July 7th,

35:47.360 --> 35:50.360
and I'm sure you're geared up to make the rounds

35:50.360 --> 35:53.360
on Maury and all the other talk shows,

35:53.360 --> 35:55.360
but if I could, can I bother you for a second?

35:55.360 --> 35:56.360
Yeah, sure, hit me.

35:56.360 --> 35:59.360
We have a listener who is into skating,

35:59.360 --> 36:02.360
like roller skating, and they wanna go to a skate park,

36:02.360 --> 36:04.360
but they're afraid of getting sort of intimidated

36:04.360 --> 36:05.360
by skateboarders.

36:05.360 --> 36:06.360
By the skateboarders.

36:06.360 --> 36:07.360
And we know that you're a pretty,

36:07.360 --> 36:08.360
you're like a grindy crust punk.

36:08.360 --> 36:09.360
Yeah.

36:09.360 --> 36:10.360
And we were hoping that you could-

36:10.360 --> 36:11.360
Hank Grinder Green.

36:11.360 --> 36:12.360
Me?

36:12.360 --> 36:13.360
Tony Hank.

36:13.360 --> 36:14.360
See, okay.

36:14.360 --> 36:15.360
I think it's better.

36:15.360 --> 36:16.360
Yeah.

36:16.360 --> 36:17.360
Still.

36:17.360 --> 36:18.360
Yeah, and obviously my new book,

36:18.360 --> 36:19.360
A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor,

36:19.360 --> 36:23.360
is about skating of various kinds.

36:23.360 --> 36:24.360
Oh, yeah.

36:24.360 --> 36:26.360
Having wheels under your feet of all sorts.

36:26.360 --> 36:29.360
It's kind of a spiritual successor to Gleaming the Cube

36:29.360 --> 36:30.360
from what I understand.

36:30.360 --> 36:31.360
I don't know what that is.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.360
It's a skate movie, okay.

36:33.360 --> 36:35.360
Now, Hank, can I ask, within your book,

36:35.360 --> 36:40.360
is the foolish endeavor deciding to get good at skating

36:40.360 --> 36:43.360
after 19 years of not being good at skating?

36:43.360 --> 36:44.360
Yeah.

36:44.360 --> 36:45.360
Because that, for me-

36:45.360 --> 36:47.360
It does generally end in broken elbows.

36:47.360 --> 36:48.360
I'm not sure-

36:48.360 --> 36:49.360
Yes.

36:49.360 --> 36:50.360
Why this is the thing.

36:50.360 --> 36:51.360
It's back, though.

36:51.360 --> 36:52.360
It's definitely back.

36:52.360 --> 36:53.360
I've seen it.

36:53.360 --> 36:56.360
I've seen the youth are roller skating again,

36:56.360 --> 36:58.360
and they look very cool.

36:58.360 --> 36:59.360
I will say that.

36:59.360 --> 37:00.360
Oh, sure.

37:00.360 --> 37:01.360
Yeah.

37:01.360 --> 37:02.360
Of course the youth are.

37:02.360 --> 37:05.360
I have become only more brittle and awkward as I have aged.

37:05.360 --> 37:08.360
I don't look at my adult body now and think,

37:08.360 --> 37:11.360
this could take falling down a bunch.

37:11.360 --> 37:13.360
You guys know that I'm actually a pretty good,

37:13.360 --> 37:15.360
I actually am a fairly good roller blader,

37:15.360 --> 37:19.360
but I feel like it's deeply uncool to be a roller blader right now.

37:19.360 --> 37:21.360
I used to play roller hockey in Florida,

37:21.360 --> 37:23.360
so I would put wheels on my feet,

37:23.360 --> 37:25.360
and I would run fast into other boys,

37:25.360 --> 37:28.360
and that was my recreation.

37:28.360 --> 37:30.360
I feel like there's,

37:30.360 --> 37:32.360
and maybe Hank, you can inform us of this,

37:32.360 --> 37:34.360
but I feel like there's an amount of time

37:34.360 --> 37:36.360
where if you don't put wheels on your feet,

37:36.360 --> 37:38.360
you should never do it again.

37:38.360 --> 37:42.360
I don't know if it's days, weeks, months, years,

37:42.360 --> 37:44.360
but I definitely feel like there is a window

37:44.360 --> 37:46.360
where one morning you wake up and you think,

37:46.360 --> 37:49.360
if I put wheels on my feet today, I will die.

37:49.360 --> 37:52.360
It's like the opposite of the saying about riding a bike.

37:52.360 --> 37:55.360
It's like once you learn to ride a bike, you never forget.

37:55.360 --> 37:59.360
But if you go more than 36 hours without wheels on your feet,

37:59.360 --> 38:00.360
give it up.

38:00.360 --> 38:01.360
It's short.

38:01.360 --> 38:02.360
It ain't long.

38:02.360 --> 38:04.360
You're sitting here thinking like, oh, what is it,

38:04.360 --> 38:06.360
like 10 years without wheels on your feet?

38:06.360 --> 38:07.360
No, bud.

38:07.360 --> 38:10.360
I'm thinking it's probably about, I would say two months.

38:10.360 --> 38:11.360
It's two months.

38:11.360 --> 38:12.360
That's so gracious.

38:12.360 --> 38:13.360
More than that for me.

38:13.360 --> 38:15.360
We're getting really close to one of my chief shames here,

38:15.360 --> 38:17.360
and I didn't expect this to happen,

38:17.360 --> 38:20.360
but it is that I bought a pair of Heelys as an adult man.

38:20.360 --> 38:22.360
I think I was probably in my 30s.

38:22.360 --> 38:23.360
Hank?

38:23.360 --> 38:24.360
Hank?

38:24.360 --> 38:25.360
Hank?

38:25.360 --> 38:26.360
Hank?

38:26.360 --> 38:27.360
Hank?

38:27.360 --> 38:28.360
Hank?

38:28.360 --> 38:29.360
Hank?

38:29.360 --> 38:30.360
Hank?

38:30.360 --> 38:31.360
Hank?

38:31.360 --> 38:32.360
Hank?

38:32.360 --> 38:33.360
Hank?

38:33.360 --> 38:34.360
Hank?

38:34.360 --> 38:35.360
Hank?

38:35.360 --> 38:36.360
Hank?

38:36.360 --> 38:37.360
Hank?

38:37.360 --> 38:38.360
Hank?

38:38.360 --> 38:39.360
Hank?

38:39.360 --> 38:40.360
Hank?

38:40.360 --> 38:41.360
Hank?

38:41.360 --> 38:42.360
Hank?

38:42.360 --> 38:47.360
I wager that I was early 30s.

38:47.360 --> 38:50.360
Even that, though, Hank, are we talking 33?

38:50.360 --> 38:52.360
Because that's Jesus' age, Hank.

38:52.360 --> 38:53.360
Could have been 33.

38:53.360 --> 38:54.360
OK.

38:54.360 --> 38:55.360
Oh, boy.

38:55.360 --> 38:56.360
Probably it may have been 34.

38:56.360 --> 38:59.360
This is the rest of this, I'm sorry, Hank.

38:59.360 --> 39:01.360
I'm sure you wanted to talk about your book and everything,

39:01.360 --> 39:03.360
but the rest of this segment is about the thing you just said.

39:03.360 --> 39:06.360
Well, no, unfortunately I need to know why you decided

39:06.360 --> 39:07.360
buying Heelys was cool.

39:07.360 --> 39:09.360
Oh my god, I actually have the solution that,

39:09.360 --> 39:11.360
thank you to Hank Green.

39:11.360 --> 39:15.200
a Hank Green, this is the play, right?

39:15.200 --> 39:20.200
You show up in your roller skates ready to shred.

39:20.540 --> 39:24.560
You have a friend, let's say a Hank Green type,

39:24.560 --> 39:28.600
show up on the same day wearing Heelys.

39:28.600 --> 39:32.280
And then you start bullying it as soon as they show up,

39:32.280 --> 39:35.240
you're like, hey, get a load of this guy.

39:35.240 --> 39:36.640
Yeah.

39:36.640 --> 39:40.800
Hey, fellow skaters, get a load of this guy in the Heelys.

39:40.800 --> 39:42.160
Can you believe this?

39:42.160 --> 39:46.720
Now, I will say, you run the risk with that plan, Justin.

39:46.720 --> 39:49.000
Then you start doing that and all the skateboarders

39:49.000 --> 39:51.200
are like, hey, bullying's not cool.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.800
I think everyone should be allowed

39:52.800 --> 39:54.360
to wheel however they want.

39:54.360 --> 39:56.820
And then the Hank Green type is welcomed

39:56.820 --> 39:58.400
into the skateboarder circle

39:58.400 --> 40:00.700
and you're kind of shunned for being a bully.

40:00.700 --> 40:04.040
You do it opposite where I show up in my Heelys

40:04.040 --> 40:07.280
and then I start bullying you, like lastly,

40:07.280 --> 40:08.760
when you show up in your roller skates

40:08.760 --> 40:10.420
and then all the people at the skate park are like,

40:10.420 --> 40:11.440
that's not cool, man.

40:11.440 --> 40:14.440
And then I have to like slunk off into the darkness.

40:14.440 --> 40:16.800
Well, roll off.

40:16.800 --> 40:18.520
Well, I never got that good at it.

40:18.520 --> 40:22.160
So I probably would just walk into the darkness

40:22.160 --> 40:25.640
and then you are forever in the good graces

40:25.640 --> 40:26.900
of the skateboarders.

40:26.900 --> 40:28.280
Yeah.

40:28.280 --> 40:30.600
Hank and John have built a business around DFTBA,

40:30.600 --> 40:32.420
don't forget to bully always.

40:32.420 --> 40:37.420
And then he's just riding the company line right now.

40:37.680 --> 40:39.040
Another great option, Hank,

40:39.040 --> 40:41.320
I know you have some clout in Hollywood.

40:41.320 --> 40:43.320
You could just make sure that,

40:43.320 --> 40:45.840
and you're doing this as a favor to this question asker,

40:45.840 --> 40:48.600
you could get Greenlit a revival.

40:48.600 --> 40:51.280
That's what they call it when one of Hank's projects

40:51.280 --> 40:52.800
is approved.

40:52.800 --> 40:54.240
Sorry, industry slang.

40:55.880 --> 40:59.440
Get Greenlit a revival of Disney's Brink

40:59.440 --> 41:01.580
starring Eric Von Detten.

41:01.580 --> 41:04.520
And you gotta get Eric Von Detten who I just Googled.

41:04.520 --> 41:05.640
He is currently working

41:05.640 --> 41:07.980
at a precious metals asset management firm.

41:07.980 --> 41:10.880
So he is out of the business of movie making

41:10.880 --> 41:11.720
and has been for a bit,

41:11.720 --> 41:14.400
but I bet, I mean, it's just like falling off a log.

41:15.400 --> 41:16.720
No, wait, hold on, I'm thinking about it.

41:16.720 --> 41:19.000
If he's been working in precious metals for this long,

41:19.000 --> 41:20.980
he probably hasn't had wheels on his feet for-

41:20.980 --> 41:23.160
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, you don't know that.

41:23.160 --> 41:26.160
I bet he straps wheels on his feet every day.

41:26.160 --> 41:29.080
Hank just stays fresh for a Brink, too.

41:29.080 --> 41:31.040
Can I say something to you, Hank?

41:31.040 --> 41:32.800
And this is a little too judgy

41:32.800 --> 41:34.040
and I wanna get your thoughts on it

41:34.040 --> 41:35.460
because I feel like we talk too much.

41:35.460 --> 41:38.520
But like, we've been in kind of a weird,

41:38.520 --> 41:40.760
I don't know if you heard about the virus and stuff,

41:40.760 --> 41:42.120
but it's been like,

41:42.120 --> 41:44.280
everybody's been kind of quarantined for a while.

41:44.280 --> 41:47.800
Can I say, I'm worried that if you have not

41:47.800 --> 41:51.720
taken this opportunity to get good at the Heelys,

41:51.720 --> 41:53.560
it probably is not gonna happen.

41:53.560 --> 41:55.140
Well, here's what happened. Does that feel like fair?

41:55.140 --> 41:57.800
Here's what happened is at one day I thought,

41:57.800 --> 41:58.800
where are my Heelys?

41:58.800 --> 42:00.320
And they weren't in my house anymore.

42:00.320 --> 42:02.720
And so this is why you get married.

42:02.720 --> 42:03.760
This is the whole reason.

42:03.760 --> 42:06.760
This is the purpose is so that your,

42:06.760 --> 42:08.640
so the person you love can think,

42:08.640 --> 42:11.480
this is something that they are not proud of

42:11.480 --> 42:13.120
and I can just make it go away.

42:13.120 --> 42:14.480
And I don't know where those Heelys went,

42:14.480 --> 42:16.960
but I do no longer own them.

42:18.040 --> 42:18.920
They're on me.

42:18.920 --> 42:20.120
I'm wearing them right now.

42:20.120 --> 42:21.280
I'm going all around the office.

42:21.280 --> 42:23.040
I look cool as heck.

42:23.040 --> 42:23.920
I bet you do.

42:23.920 --> 42:25.720
I feel like we fixed this.

42:25.720 --> 42:28.660
Hank, tell us about your book.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.360
And then like in a sexy way,

42:32.360 --> 42:33.840
like that lets people know why they should

42:33.840 --> 42:34.960
absolutely get it.

42:34.960 --> 42:35.800
Adventure.

42:35.800 --> 42:37.460
It's about adventure.

42:37.460 --> 42:40.360
It's about the things that happen

42:40.360 --> 42:41.720
when you get famous on the internet.

42:41.720 --> 42:45.040
It's also about the platforms that control us

42:45.040 --> 42:47.680
and how ridiculously powerful they are

42:47.680 --> 42:49.700
and how much of our brains they take up

42:49.700 --> 42:51.480
and what they might look like in the future.

42:51.480 --> 42:53.840
It's a science fiction adventure story

42:53.840 --> 42:56.640
about young people trying to make their way in the world.

42:57.720 --> 42:58.560
Wow.

42:58.560 --> 43:00.960
Does it have cool fights?

43:00.960 --> 43:01.880
It does have cool fights.

43:01.880 --> 43:03.820
The second one has a lot of cool fights, actually.

43:03.820 --> 43:04.660
It was really fun.

43:04.660 --> 43:05.500
Fuck yeah.

43:05.500 --> 43:06.760
What's the first one called

43:06.760 --> 43:08.360
in case we only want to catch up?

43:08.360 --> 43:09.200
Yeah.

43:09.200 --> 43:10.020
The first cool fight.

43:10.020 --> 43:10.860
What did you call the first cool fight?

43:10.860 --> 43:11.680
Is it like swords?

43:11.680 --> 43:12.520
Swords versus knives.

43:12.520 --> 43:14.640
The battle of lower sword Phil.

43:14.640 --> 43:15.860
There are giant robots.

43:15.860 --> 43:18.960
I think people might be into that.

43:18.960 --> 43:21.300
And there's mostly punching.

43:22.340 --> 43:23.640
And the first one's called

43:23.640 --> 43:24.860
An Absolutely Remarkable Thing.

43:24.860 --> 43:26.200
And it's available cheap on audio

43:26.200 --> 43:28.160
if you want to go that route and catch up real quick.

43:28.160 --> 43:29.600
Did you read it?

43:29.600 --> 43:30.440
I did not.

43:30.440 --> 43:31.520
It's from the perspective of,

43:31.520 --> 43:34.440
the story is like a memoir of a 23 year old woman.

43:34.440 --> 43:36.520
So it would be weird if I read it.

43:36.520 --> 43:38.760
Hank, one last question about your book.

43:38.760 --> 43:41.300
Did you come up with some kind of cool futuristic

43:41.300 --> 43:43.140
like substitute for money?

43:43.140 --> 43:43.980
Yeah.

43:43.980 --> 43:44.800
What are they called?

43:44.800 --> 43:45.640
Creds?

43:45.640 --> 43:46.460
Zerks?

43:46.460 --> 43:47.300
Cyberchips?

43:47.300 --> 43:48.140
Zinni?

43:48.140 --> 43:50.160
The problem is that yes.

43:50.160 --> 43:51.320
Yeah.

43:51.320 --> 43:52.160
God dang it.

43:52.160 --> 43:53.500
That makes it sound bad.

43:53.500 --> 43:54.460
Well, no, not bad.

43:54.460 --> 43:55.760
It's just my favorite thing

43:55.760 --> 43:59.080
about writing any kind of sci-fi or fantasy

43:59.080 --> 44:00.840
is having to at some point sit down

44:00.840 --> 44:03.200
and think, what am I going to call money?

44:03.200 --> 44:05.520
Because I can't just call it money.

44:05.520 --> 44:06.560
Well, there's money.

44:06.560 --> 44:08.240
There's still regular money,

44:08.240 --> 44:09.660
but then there is in the second book,

44:09.660 --> 44:12.760
it's kind of an important plot point

44:12.760 --> 44:15.040
that a new currency does get developed

44:15.040 --> 44:17.880
and starts to take on some credibility.

44:17.880 --> 44:18.840
Is it Bitcoin?

44:18.840 --> 44:21.720
So you didn't just make up a future currency.

44:21.720 --> 44:25.160
You wrote, Travis got it like right to the quick.

44:25.160 --> 44:27.960
You wrote the whole book about new cyber money.

44:27.960 --> 44:28.800
Right.

44:28.800 --> 44:30.600
And I've also, I'm launching the cyber money

44:30.600 --> 44:35.240
on Tuesday, and you can get in on the ground floor.

44:35.240 --> 44:37.240
Get yourself some Hank Green.

44:39.240 --> 44:40.080
Wuffa doofa.

44:40.080 --> 44:41.020
I'm leaving.

44:41.020 --> 44:42.320
Yes, thank you, Hank.

44:42.320 --> 44:43.160
Thanks, Hank.

44:43.160 --> 44:43.980
Bye.

44:43.980 --> 44:44.820
Thanks for the help.

44:44.820 --> 44:45.640
I can't stay any longer.

44:45.640 --> 44:48.100
Grind off, grind off into the sunset.

44:48.100 --> 44:48.940
Reee!

44:52.940 --> 44:57.200
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

44:57.200 --> 45:00.740
Choo-loo-lee-loo-loo-loo-loo-loo-loo-loo-loo-loo.

45:00.740 --> 45:01.900
I want a munch.

45:01.900 --> 45:02.740
Squat!

45:02.740 --> 45:03.560
Squat.

45:03.560 --> 45:04.680
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

45:04.680 --> 45:06.540
I want too much.

45:06.540 --> 45:07.840
Squat.

45:07.840 --> 45:10.340
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

45:10.340 --> 45:11.220
Welcome to Munch Squad.

45:11.220 --> 45:12.240
It's a podcast within a podcast

45:12.240 --> 45:14.940
about the latest and greatest brand eating.

45:14.940 --> 45:17.280
I have some current Munch,

45:17.280 --> 45:19.600
don't have to dig back into the nooks

45:19.600 --> 45:22.160
and crannies of history courtesy of Mark.

45:22.160 --> 45:26.280
And here's the headline, folks.

45:26.280 --> 45:28.880
The rumors are true.

45:28.880 --> 45:31.440
Baskin Robbins and Bud Light Seltzer pairings

45:31.440 --> 45:33.680
are the summer drinks you never knew you needed.

45:33.680 --> 45:34.520
Ew!

45:35.680 --> 45:39.080
There was so much information in that sentence

45:39.080 --> 45:41.880
that I did not know and it all sucked.

45:41.880 --> 45:45.840
31 flavors and Bud Light Seltzer pairings

45:45.840 --> 45:48.520
are the summer drinks you never knew you needed.

45:48.520 --> 45:50.280
Whether your idea of the perfect summer refreshment

45:50.280 --> 45:53.360
comes in a scoop or a skinny can,

45:53.360 --> 45:56.880
no matter which flavor of pervert you are,

45:56.880 --> 45:58.360
we've got you covered.

45:58.360 --> 46:01.500
We got an idea that'll take your summer plans up a notch.

46:01.500 --> 46:03.520
We've partnered with Bud Light

46:03.520 --> 46:05.680
to dream up delectable hard seltzer

46:05.680 --> 46:08.200
and Baskin Robbins pairings for you to sip on

46:08.200 --> 46:10.140
all summer long.

46:10.140 --> 46:13.400
And then this is where it goes next.

46:13.400 --> 46:18.220
Hard seltzers are crisp, refreshingly bubbly beverages

46:18.220 --> 46:20.600
that have gained immense popularity,

46:20.600 --> 46:23.700
especially since big name brewer Bud Light

46:23.700 --> 46:25.800
entered the game earlier this year.

46:26.960 --> 46:28.560
They're so incredibly popular

46:28.560 --> 46:30.100
that we're using the second paragraph

46:30.100 --> 46:31.760
to tell you what they are.

46:32.680 --> 46:33.800
And more than that,

46:35.380 --> 46:40.280
really kind of seems like a flagrant lie

46:40.280 --> 46:45.000
to say that they became popular once Bud entered the game.

46:45.000 --> 46:50.000
Especially since big name brewer Bud Light

46:50.080 --> 46:52.840
entered the game earlier this year with four flavors,

46:52.840 --> 46:56.320
including lemon lime, strawberry, black cherry, and mango.

46:56.320 --> 46:58.760
If you've tried all the flavors

46:58.760 --> 47:01.840
and are looking for a new way to liven up your seltzer,

47:01.840 --> 47:03.280
because who isn't,

47:03.280 --> 47:06.280
we've got four tasty ways to do just that.

47:06.280 --> 47:09.200
Bud Light seltzer features natural carbonation

47:09.200 --> 47:12.180
and quality ingredients like sparkling water,

47:12.180 --> 47:15.120
real cane sugar, and natural fruit flavors.

47:15.120 --> 47:18.400
That's right, Bud Light seltzer is the perfect drink

47:18.400 --> 47:23.400
for you health nuts out there looking to eat clean.

47:23.600 --> 47:25.440
Bud Light seltzer.

47:25.440 --> 47:29.480
It's the perfect canvas for an adult ice cream float.

47:29.480 --> 47:32.800
Okay, so they've been kind of dancing around.

47:32.800 --> 47:36.080
They've been hinting at like the thesis statement

47:36.080 --> 47:39.040
of this press release, and there you have it.

47:39.040 --> 47:41.460
Put some ice cream in your seltzer.

47:41.460 --> 47:45.320
Hey, we're Baskin Robbins, and we wanna get you fucked up.

47:45.320 --> 47:48.560
It says, scoop a healthy spoonful

47:48.560 --> 47:51.520
of the Baskin Robbins flavor and drop it into your glass

47:51.520 --> 47:55.600
or blend the two together for a fruity, freezing cocktail.

47:55.600 --> 48:00.600
Folks, before you heard this press release,

48:00.600 --> 48:03.840
if you went to a friend's house and you said,

48:03.840 --> 48:05.040
what are you drinking?

48:05.040 --> 48:07.920
And they said, I dumped some Baskin Robbins

48:07.920 --> 48:09.720
into a Bud Light seltzer,

48:09.720 --> 48:11.800
you would call the police.

48:11.800 --> 48:15.320
You would have them put on some sort of watch

48:15.320 --> 48:18.200
to make sure that they did not destroy themselves

48:18.200 --> 48:20.280
because this is a desperate person.

48:20.280 --> 48:21.960
But now that you've seen this press release,

48:21.960 --> 48:25.760
it's a fun summer trend, I guess.

48:25.760 --> 48:29.240
Can I say that the most troubling thing about that,

48:29.240 --> 48:33.040
if a friend or former friend of mine had done this,

48:33.040 --> 48:35.240
is the forethought that it would take

48:35.240 --> 48:37.120
to be able to engage in this beverage?

48:37.120 --> 48:41.320
Because I don't know that you can buy pints

48:41.320 --> 48:42.480
of Baskin Robbins.

48:42.480 --> 48:45.000
I think you have to go to the store to get it,

48:45.000 --> 48:46.680
at which point you would sit there and think,

48:46.680 --> 48:50.960
well, I've got the Bud Seltzer mango in the fridge,

48:50.960 --> 48:54.180
so I'm gonna go on a 40-minute round trip

48:54.180 --> 48:57.640
to go grab some BR to really complete the picture.

48:57.640 --> 48:58.600
Clarify for me, Justin.

48:58.600 --> 49:02.200
Are they making these in-house at Baskin Robbins?

49:02.200 --> 49:05.480
Is this a press release saying, hey, we thought, hey.

49:05.480 --> 49:09.240
One thing you could do when you go home

49:09.240 --> 49:12.760
is get some Bud Light Seltzer and dump this ice cream into it.

49:12.760 --> 49:14.860
That's fucking wild.

49:15.880 --> 49:17.040
Do you think?

49:17.040 --> 49:19.880
That's wild, no, it's absolute madness,

49:19.880 --> 49:22.720
especially considering I wanna get fucked up,

49:22.720 --> 49:24.760
but I wanna do it really slowly

49:24.760 --> 49:27.280
because I melted a slurry of ice cream into it

49:27.280 --> 49:30.000
and I want it to be like half butter.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.440
It's the ideal drink, delicious, thank you.

49:32.440 --> 49:34.440
But this isn't, maybe the Seltzer is good,

49:34.440 --> 49:36.200
but you know what would bring it home?

49:36.200 --> 49:38.560
Some melty milk in it.

49:38.560 --> 49:41.360
They don't do this with other shit.

49:41.360 --> 49:43.320
Baskin Robbins has never put out a press release before

49:43.320 --> 49:46.900
that's like, do you like our Rocky Road ice cream?

49:46.900 --> 49:49.600
You should take it home and put Nutella on it.

49:49.600 --> 49:51.040
You're welcome, we love you.

49:51.040 --> 49:53.080
Baskin Robbins, don't forget.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.560
From three days before this press release came out,

49:56.560 --> 49:58.980
June 26th, stay cool this summer

49:58.980 --> 50:02.640
with cotton candy crackle drink recipes from Baskin Robbins.

50:02.640 --> 50:05.840
First up, the cotton candy crackle pina colada.

50:05.840 --> 50:09.000
It's gonna start with two and a half ounces of white rum,

50:09.000 --> 50:10.620
two ounces of pina colada mix,

50:10.620 --> 50:13.760
one four ounce scoop of cotton candy crackle ice cream,

50:13.760 --> 50:16.960
a cup of ice, and then you make it in a blender

50:16.960 --> 50:18.080
and then you drink it

50:18.080 --> 50:21.440
because Baskin Robbins is done fucking around.

50:21.440 --> 50:22.640
We're done.

50:22.640 --> 50:24.900
They know you wanna get fucked up.

50:24.900 --> 50:26.360
This situation that we're all in

50:26.360 --> 50:27.640
will not be fixed by ice cream,

50:27.640 --> 50:30.400
but maybe if you put some rum in it,

50:30.400 --> 50:33.840
maybe that would be enough to create a bomb.

50:33.840 --> 50:36.720
We know your kid just had a big softball game,

50:36.720 --> 50:38.440
so you're looking to get him a treat,

50:38.440 --> 50:42.520
but also your boss has really been riding you at the office.

50:42.520 --> 50:45.240
Don't you worry, Baskin Robbins has you covered on

50:45.240 --> 50:47.160
both fronts, friends.

50:47.160 --> 50:51.080
TCBY already beat us, we're fucking done.

50:51.080 --> 50:53.240
Take a fucking sit, babes.

50:53.240 --> 50:54.400
It's over.

50:54.400 --> 50:57.280
Try Baskin Robbins toffee crunch

50:57.280 --> 51:00.480
with a big heap and a spoonful of cocaine.

51:00.480 --> 51:04.880
I think that the last step of this

51:04.880 --> 51:07.720
pina colada, cotton candy crackle pina colada recipe

51:07.720 --> 51:11.280
is pour into a hurricane glass

51:11.280 --> 51:13.120
and garnish with a colorful straw.

51:13.120 --> 51:16.880
Hey, newsflash, if you're the sort of person

51:16.880 --> 51:21.040
that's gonna mix up a fucking cotton candy cocktail,

51:21.040 --> 51:22.360
you are not taking the time

51:22.360 --> 51:24.740
to select appropriate glassware.

51:24.740 --> 51:27.880
Yeah, it's whatever fucking container that will hold it,

51:27.880 --> 51:29.480
including my mouth and body.

51:29.480 --> 51:30.860
I gotta gram this.

51:31.720 --> 51:34.580
Yeah, I gotta gram my defeat.

51:35.840 --> 51:39.320
Hey, everybody, the influencer Travis here, I've given up.

51:41.640 --> 51:45.720
Everybody, I'm chronicling my descent.

51:45.720 --> 51:48.360
Here's the first of you guys in November.

51:48.360 --> 51:50.280
Hey, it's Baskin Robbins, we've got a great recipe

51:50.280 --> 51:52.680
for you, pick up our new cotton candy flavored ice cream,

51:52.680 --> 51:54.760
go grab yourself a King Cobra malt liquor

51:54.760 --> 51:57.440
from the gas station nearby, and oh, what's that?

51:57.440 --> 51:58.960
You don't have the ice cream?

51:58.960 --> 52:00.960
That's fine still.

52:00.960 --> 52:03.880
No bowl, just swish them around in your mouth.

52:03.880 --> 52:06.920
It'll be great, it'll be so great.

52:07.960 --> 52:10.800
This one, this one, okay.

52:10.800 --> 52:15.720
This one is a cotton candy crackle mermaid float, okay?

52:15.720 --> 52:20.720
So this is eight ounces of lemon lime soda chilled.

52:20.720 --> 52:23.760
Okay, so eight ounces of Sprite,

52:23.760 --> 52:25.680
one ounce of whipped cream vodka.

52:25.680 --> 52:26.520
Oh, boy.

52:27.920 --> 52:30.520
And a half ounce of blue curacao,

52:30.520 --> 52:33.920
and 2.5 ounce scoop of cotton candy crackle ice cream.

52:33.920 --> 52:36.040
I did not need a measurement on that, thank you.

52:36.040 --> 52:38.040
Just a scoop, I have a question.

52:38.040 --> 52:40.400
Eight ounces of Sprite and one ounce of vodka?

52:40.400 --> 52:43.880
What is that supposed to do for me, a man?

52:43.880 --> 52:46.720
I'm a 39-year-old man, what do you want me to do

52:46.720 --> 52:50.120
with eight ounces of Sprite mixed with an ounce of vodka?

52:50.120 --> 52:51.320
It does kind of make it seem like

52:51.320 --> 52:53.560
whoever the watchdogs were who got upset

52:53.560 --> 52:56.760
about Joe Camel seemingly appealing to children

52:56.760 --> 53:00.520
are probably like, hey, red flag on this one, too?

53:00.520 --> 53:03.160
You're making cocktails for kids.

53:03.160 --> 53:06.520
This is a cocktail for teens, sorry, pal.

53:06.520 --> 53:09.240
Hey, is your dad out of town this weekend?

53:09.240 --> 53:11.080
Yeah, right, this is the perfect thing.

53:11.080 --> 53:13.800
It's blue and has ice cream floating in it.

53:15.240 --> 53:16.800
But thank you, Baskin Robbins,

53:16.800 --> 53:19.720
for giving us what we need as a nation.

53:19.720 --> 53:22.800
There is a Baskin Robbins near me, so, oh, by the way,

53:22.800 --> 53:24.600
oh, I did want to mention one thing,

53:26.260 --> 53:27.600
one of the last things on here.

53:27.600 --> 53:32.600
It talks about how you can go to order.baskinrobbins.com

53:33.600 --> 53:37.280
to figure out how to get Baskin Robbins delivered to you.

53:37.280 --> 53:38.940
And then the next paragraph is,

53:38.940 --> 53:41.320
if you want Bud Light seltzers delivered directly

53:41.320 --> 53:43.680
to your doorstep, visit, and they give the link.

53:43.680 --> 53:47.160
So this is quite the little one-act play

53:47.160 --> 53:48.460
they've written here for us.

53:48.460 --> 53:49.960
This is a person that doesn't need

53:49.960 --> 53:53.280
to leave the house anymore because both Bud Light seltzer

53:53.280 --> 53:56.440
and Baskin Robbins is delivered to their doorstep.

53:56.440 --> 53:57.880
They know exactly who they're targeting.

53:57.880 --> 54:00.960
Justin, I would posit that what this is

54:00.960 --> 54:04.020
is them acknowledging that if you have reached the point

54:04.020 --> 54:07.120
where you are ready to mix Bud Light seltzer

54:07.120 --> 54:10.840
and Baskin Robbins, you are not safe to drive anymore.

54:10.840 --> 54:12.040
You have reached the point

54:12.040 --> 54:13.560
where you have already been drinking

54:13.560 --> 54:16.860
and you thought, oh, you know what I want.

54:16.860 --> 54:18.720
You know, it sounds good to me.

54:18.720 --> 54:21.760
You've crossed the Bud Light event horizon at that point.

54:21.760 --> 54:23.520
No light can escape.

54:23.520 --> 54:25.320
Hey, can I do a quick Yahoo?

54:25.320 --> 54:26.160
Sure.

54:26.160 --> 54:26.980
This one's sent in by Graham Roebuck, thank you.

54:26.980 --> 54:28.720
It's from Yahoo Answers user Josh,

54:28.720 --> 54:33.060
slightly pertinent to the preceding bit,

54:33.060 --> 54:35.040
the little skit we just did.

54:35.040 --> 54:37.680
Josh asks, what can I say to sound

54:37.680 --> 54:39.760
like I've had beer before?

54:39.760 --> 54:42.680
Are there any words or phrases that could make it sound

54:42.680 --> 54:44.300
like I have drank beer before?

54:44.300 --> 54:45.340
Thanks.

54:45.340 --> 54:47.400
Brewski, for sure.

54:48.360 --> 54:50.960
Slide me a brewski is good.

54:50.960 --> 54:53.480
Beer me, if you say like beer me.

54:53.480 --> 54:54.320
That's not anything,

54:54.320 --> 54:56.360
because that's like people say that already

54:56.360 --> 54:57.380
about other stuff.

54:57.380 --> 54:59.940
I think you've got to say something.

55:01.200 --> 55:05.040
There are terms, okay, things like hops.

55:05.040 --> 55:06.520
Ooh, you can really taste the hops.

55:06.520 --> 55:07.360
Oh, I see.

55:07.360 --> 55:08.520
Have you ever had Keystone Light?

55:08.520 --> 55:10.760
I can't, the hops are a little assertive for me.

55:10.760 --> 55:11.600
I'm not really sure.

55:11.600 --> 55:13.920
Yeah, but it's like, oh, assertive hops is good,

55:13.920 --> 55:15.880
but if you want to be someone who's like into beer,

55:15.880 --> 55:18.020
you can be like, hmm, hoppy birthday to me.

55:18.020 --> 55:20.800
This one is really hoppy.

55:20.800 --> 55:23.120
This is a very hoppy one you've given me.

55:23.120 --> 55:24.680
That's a Bud Light seltzer.

55:25.800 --> 55:29.000
Yeah, you can't, it can't be anything,

55:29.000 --> 55:30.240
you've raised a good point, Travis.

55:30.240 --> 55:33.400
It can't be anything where you get caught

55:33.400 --> 55:35.680
with it not being that, right?

55:35.680 --> 55:37.200
Yeah, I mean, you've got to look at the ingredient list

55:37.200 --> 55:39.760
of whatever you're drinking to make sure hops is in them,

55:39.760 --> 55:40.580
is in there.

55:41.680 --> 55:42.720
Is hops in here?

55:42.720 --> 55:44.480
That's not good.

55:44.480 --> 55:46.120
That's not good either.

55:46.120 --> 55:49.760
You can really taste the Rocky Mountain water there.

55:49.760 --> 55:53.360
You get, that's what you just announce, like loudly,

55:53.360 --> 55:57.720
like, hmm, malt water and hops, can't believe it.

55:57.720 --> 55:58.680
Can't beat it.

55:58.680 --> 55:59.520
Oh, you know what's it?

55:59.520 --> 56:02.520
Malt water, yeast and hops, that's it.

56:02.520 --> 56:03.360
That's the stuff.

56:03.360 --> 56:04.320
Here's a power term.

56:04.320 --> 56:06.520
Here's a power word that you can use.

56:06.520 --> 56:08.000
Oh, it's skunked.

56:08.000 --> 56:08.840
Oh, this is skunked.

56:08.840 --> 56:11.480
Oh, this is, oh, this is skunked.

56:11.480 --> 56:15.840
Oh, man, ah, oh, this is skunked.

56:15.840 --> 56:19.280
This fricking, this fricking Smirnoff Ice is skunked, baby.

56:19.280 --> 56:21.720
Oh, the hops have gone so bad in this one.

56:21.720 --> 56:25.280
Oh, the hops are really skunked in this one.

56:25.280 --> 56:30.060
Oh, oh, oh, you skunked out the hops.

56:30.060 --> 56:33.160
Oh, the brewer skunked the hops for sure on this one, guys.

56:33.160 --> 56:35.760
The brewer skunked the Anthony Hopkins in this one,

56:35.760 --> 56:36.600
huh, gang?

56:36.600 --> 56:40.920
The Jim Brewer skunked Anthony Hopkins.

56:40.920 --> 56:41.760
Ah.

56:43.680 --> 56:45.860
You can talk about how much you hate wine.

56:45.860 --> 56:46.700
Yeah.

56:46.700 --> 56:48.940
Oh, that's actually, yeah, absolutely.

56:48.940 --> 56:50.700
This is, we may want to come at this

56:50.700 --> 56:53.240
with a little bit more lateral thinking

56:53.240 --> 56:57.000
because I feel like there's lots of ways to say things.

56:57.000 --> 57:00.260
Like if I heard someone say things like,

57:02.760 --> 57:05.640
oh, yeah, Richardson's got a good arm this year,

57:05.640 --> 57:08.000
I'd be like, that person has had beer before.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.360
Do you know what I mean?

57:09.360 --> 57:10.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57:10.200 --> 57:11.040
Oh, absolutely.

57:11.040 --> 57:11.860
Yeah, I just don't,

57:11.860 --> 57:14.200
I don't think Jeff Gordon's ever gonna reach this plate.

57:14.200 --> 57:17.320
You have had, that is someone who has had beer before.

57:17.320 --> 57:19.240
But may I pitch this?

57:19.240 --> 57:20.760
You take a sip of the beer and you say,

57:20.760 --> 57:22.520
you know what this reminds me of?

57:22.520 --> 57:25.400
Out on the lake with the boys, right?

57:25.400 --> 57:28.180
That's not bad, that's not bad.

57:28.180 --> 57:30.680
Because then it directly says,

57:30.680 --> 57:33.400
I've had an experience with this beer before.

57:33.400 --> 57:35.000
If someone said, have you ever had beer before?

57:35.000 --> 57:36.040
You're gonna say, mm, yeah,

57:36.040 --> 57:38.960
the taste reminds me of darts with pawpaw.

57:38.960 --> 57:41.400
Right, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

57:41.400 --> 57:44.560
I remember he snuck me a little sip

57:44.560 --> 57:46.480
when I was just eight years old.

57:46.480 --> 57:51.120
Get the beer, crack it open, have a huge guzzle,

57:51.120 --> 57:53.520
don't cough or throw up.

57:53.520 --> 57:55.640
Because it's not gonna taste good to you the first time.

57:55.640 --> 57:58.520
You take a huge drink and then you just loudly announce,

57:58.520 --> 58:00.560
mm, not a single chunk.

58:00.560 --> 58:03.920
Yeah, I like that.

58:03.920 --> 58:07.560
Because that's, mm, not a single chunk in this one.

58:07.560 --> 58:11.120
Usually pawpaws brews, I have to ring out of a cheesecloth.

58:11.120 --> 58:12.360
Not this one, chunk free.

58:12.360 --> 58:14.320
What is this, Keystone Light?

58:14.320 --> 58:16.020
Wow, so smooth. Yeah, when you finish it,

58:16.020 --> 58:18.600
look down in the bottom, look straight through the hole

58:18.600 --> 58:20.640
and say, mm, not a winner.

58:20.640 --> 58:21.720
And when they're like, what do you mean?

58:21.720 --> 58:23.280
Like, oh, you don't know?

58:23.280 --> 58:25.120
And laugh it off and walk away.

58:25.120 --> 58:27.200
Leave them wondering. Leave them wondering.

58:27.200 --> 58:28.440
You also don't have to drink the beer.

58:28.440 --> 58:29.560
I'm assuming you don't want to drink the beer,

58:29.560 --> 58:31.320
which is noble.

58:31.320 --> 58:32.800
You could just crack one open and be like,

58:32.800 --> 58:35.400
mm, I can't wait to drink my 10th beer

58:35.400 --> 58:38.000
and then spill it all over the ground.

58:38.000 --> 58:38.840
No!

58:40.660 --> 58:44.480
Before you drink it, just be like, mm, my 10th of the day.

58:44.480 --> 58:46.600
Can't believe it. 10th beer today.

58:47.900 --> 58:50.720
I promised myself after I finished my novel,

58:50.720 --> 58:53.120
I would have my 10th beer of the day.

58:53.120 --> 58:55.920
Just get 12 cans of beer, pour them all down the toilet

58:55.920 --> 58:57.360
and then scatter them around your yard.

58:57.360 --> 58:58.440
And when your friends show up, be like,

58:58.440 --> 59:01.560
can someone help me pick up the 12 empty beer cans

59:01.560 --> 59:02.400
I drank today?

59:02.400 --> 59:04.120
I shouldn't drink any more.

59:04.120 --> 59:05.640
Any more of this.

59:05.640 --> 59:08.760
Hey, yeah, you guys should have partied with me earlier.

59:08.760 --> 59:10.200
Everybody was over here.

59:10.200 --> 59:13.320
Squiggo, dumb Phil, everybody.

59:13.320 --> 59:14.560
Smart Larry.

59:14.560 --> 59:18.240
Smart Larry, we were all getting absolutely snackered on.

59:18.240 --> 59:19.920
You guys can drink now if you want.

59:19.920 --> 59:21.440
I'll just watch.

59:21.440 --> 59:22.520
Yeah, you guys watch,

59:22.520 --> 59:23.880
because I'm already pretty snackered

59:23.880 --> 59:26.480
on these beautiful tall boys that I call beer.

59:26.480 --> 59:28.360
They were hoppy as hell.

59:28.360 --> 59:30.960
They were so fucking hoppy.

59:30.960 --> 59:32.900
You should have been here.

59:32.900 --> 59:35.240
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast,

59:35.240 --> 59:36.240
my brother, my brother, and me.

59:36.240 --> 59:38.780
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

59:38.780 --> 59:42.040
We hope that you're hanging in there and doing well.

59:42.880 --> 59:45.920
And that's the main thing we wanted to get across

59:45.920 --> 59:47.080
is just how much we love you.

59:47.080 --> 59:47.920
Yeah.

59:47.920 --> 59:49.520
That's the big thing.

59:49.520 --> 59:51.980
Hey, we got a new graphic novel book coming out.

59:51.980 --> 59:52.820
What?

59:52.820 --> 59:54.280
Next week?

59:54.280 --> 59:55.440
Holy shit, yeah.

59:55.440 --> 59:57.720
It's the Adventure Zone Pedals to the Metal,

59:57.720 --> 01:00:00.060
third installment in our adaptation

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:02.800
of the Adventure Zone Balance arc.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:05.920
And you have just a little bit more time to pre-order that

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.200
if you want to get it on release day.

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:09.600
I just got two big fucking boxes

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.440
chock full of these beauties.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:13.920
Lovely book, lovely book.

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.080
Very excited for it to be out there.

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:17.400
And not only is the book coming out,

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:19.680
which you can pre-order at The Adventure Zone,

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.160
theadventurezonecomic.com,

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.800
we also have a live event,

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:27.360
a virtual live event happening on July 17th

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:28.680
at 8 p.m. Eastern time.

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:31.200
It's gonna be streaming and free to watch.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.200
It's gonna be featuring us, Kerry,

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.320

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:40.240
and buy exclusive signed copies of the books

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:45.240
from The Strand at bit.ly slash TazGNLive.

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:47.720
I don't know if capitalization matters.

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:52.140
If it does, TazGN and the L are all capitalized.

01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:55.740
So bit.ly slash TazGNLive.

01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:58.880
And you can watch us do some readings.

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:01.240
We're gonna do a Q&A about the book

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:03.400
and you can order signed copies.

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.920
It's gonna be fun as hell.

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.840
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.360
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:10.800
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed,

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.880
which is just a terrific album,

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:16.520
terrific piece of artistic work.

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.760
And you should listen to it.

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.480
I got two more quick announcements.

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:23.480
One, supporting roles, the D&D live stream

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.900
that I'm doing along with some amazing people.

01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:30.900
We postponed it and we will be doing it on the 11th.

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:35.740
So that is, what, this Saturday

01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:37.620

Also, we got new merch, a really cool, wonderful poster.

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:53.420
It's for the show Wonderful and it is also wonderful.

01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:57.780

01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:00.140

Thank you so much for listening.

01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:13.900
Griffin, do you have a final Yahoo to share with us?

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:14.740
Oh, I sure do.

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:16.060
This one was also sent in by Adrian Kals.

01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:16.900
Thank you, Adrian.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:19.820
It's Yahoo Answers user Bowie asks,

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:24.820
could mashed potatoes be considered a sauce?

01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:31.300
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:32.540
I'm Travis McElroy.

I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.700
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:36.540
Kiss your dad.

01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:37.520
Square on the lips.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:53.020
I'm Travis McElroy and this has been my brother, my brother and me.

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:54.020
Kiss your dad.

I'm Travis McElroy and this has been my brother, my brother and me.

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:15.020
Kiss your dad.

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:16.020
Square on the lips.

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:17.020
I'm Travis McElroy and this has been my brother, my brother and me.

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:18.020
Kiss your dad.

I'm Travis McElroy and this has been my brother, my brother and me.
