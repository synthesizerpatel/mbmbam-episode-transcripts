00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:50.160
Does anybody remember Laughter? That's one of my favorite lines from the hit movie,

00:50.160 --> 00:55.680
Almost Famous. I remember laughing. It was just one Monday ago when I listened to My Brother,

00:55.680 --> 01:01.840
My Brother, Me, but the sun has gone around the earth seven times. Is that it? That's how it goes,

01:01.840 --> 01:10.880
and we're back for another episode of Jucks, Jokes, and Chorkels, and Jucks, and Chorks,

01:10.880 --> 01:17.200
and Mighty Ducks, and Mighty Ducks. Quack. This is My Brother, My Brother, Me. It's an

01:17.200 --> 01:24.400
advice show for the modern era. I am Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:24.400 --> 01:30.400
So our show is that you ask us things, and then we take those things, and we make you

01:30.400 --> 01:37.440
sound smarter by giving you the answers to all your problems. So let's get right into the answers

01:37.440 --> 01:44.160
to the problems. I get ultra nervous around famous people. How can I work through my fear and build

01:44.160 --> 01:50.400
up enough courage to talk to Felicia Day or Bruce Campbell at the Chicago Comic Con this year? That's

01:50.400 --> 01:59.280
from Chaz Monroe. The easy answer is you don't. Don't. Don't do that. What do they need with you?

01:59.280 --> 02:03.520
What do you have to say to people like them? Their lives are so much cooler than yours.

02:04.720 --> 02:10.880
Well, the thing is, it's win-win, though. What are you going to say to them where Bruce

02:10.880 --> 02:17.600
Campbell's going to make the decision not to hang out with you anymore? What have you got to lose?

02:17.600 --> 02:21.840
Travis is really the one to be answering this question, because we usually,

02:21.840 --> 02:26.560
if we see a celebrity or something, what we do is we tell Travis to go talk to them.

02:26.560 --> 02:29.360
Oh, God. Yeah, he's our envoy to the stars.

02:31.920 --> 02:34.400
Well, the nice thing is you can walk up to Bruce Campbell and be like,

02:34.400 --> 02:37.840
hey, Bruce, shove it, and then walk away. He has no idea who you are.

02:39.440 --> 02:41.360
Yeah, because they don't have feelings.

02:41.360 --> 02:45.600
Well, but if you walk up and you say the nicest compliment you could possibly construct,

02:45.600 --> 02:52.240
or the meanest insult, your stock doesn't go down in Bruce Campbell's eyes.

02:52.240 --> 02:59.280
That's true. This conundrum is all in your head. If you say to yourself,

02:59.280 --> 03:03.120
ah, screw it, I'm just going to be normal and polite, that's the number one thing.

03:03.840 --> 03:07.120
What you don't want is for them to walk away thinking, man, what a weirdo.

03:07.120 --> 03:07.680
Yeah.

03:07.680 --> 03:10.000
What a weird guy. Now, speaking of this,

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
Travis, did you or did you not once give Bruce Campbell a cookie? Is that accurate?

03:14.000 --> 03:18.480
I did. I did give him a cookie because he was talking about how everybody was giving him

03:18.480 --> 03:23.920
hand-drawn pictures of Ash and action figures that they had made in their basement,

03:23.920 --> 03:25.520
working on it for several weeks.

03:25.520 --> 03:26.240
Ash Ketchum?

03:26.880 --> 03:30.880
Yeah, Ash Ketchum. And I was like, well, do you want a cookie? I didn't make it,

03:30.880 --> 03:34.640
but you can have it. And he was like, that's the greatest thing anyone's ever given me.

03:34.640 --> 03:38.480
So anyone who sees Bruce Campbell at Comic-Con, give him a cookie.

03:38.480 --> 03:40.080
He's down, man.

03:40.080 --> 03:42.640
I guarantee he did not eat that cookie.

03:42.640 --> 03:46.080
He did not. Hey, Darlene, throw this in the poison box for me.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.280
It's chocolate chip and pills.

03:52.880 --> 03:54.560
I cried into it just a little.

03:55.760 --> 03:58.480
Just remember, when it comes to talking to famous people,

03:58.480 --> 04:01.360
really your only goal should be that for years to come,

04:01.360 --> 04:03.840
you can tell your friends how you talk to Bruce Campbell.

04:04.400 --> 04:07.760
Yeah, it's not going to matter much to Bruce Campbell, ultimately.

04:07.760 --> 04:09.760
Like, if you expect them to look at you and go, man,

04:09.760 --> 04:11.280
that was a really witty thing you just said.

04:11.280 --> 04:13.600
You seem like somebody I could be best friends with.

04:13.600 --> 04:14.640
Yeah, that's not happening.

04:14.640 --> 04:18.800
That's the thing. You've got to be realistic about what the interaction is going to be,

04:18.800 --> 04:21.040
because they're not going to walk away thinking like, man,

04:21.040 --> 04:23.600
I wish I had more time to chill with that dude.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.200
It's just not how people's brains are wired.

04:27.360 --> 04:30.320
Just try to make the best impression possible and be confident.

04:30.320 --> 04:31.840
That's the number one thing.

04:31.840 --> 04:36.560
Although I bet the only thing Bruce Campbell hates more than when people come up to him

04:36.560 --> 04:45.520
and are super skin-peelingly awkward are the people who think they can hang on the same level

04:45.520 --> 04:48.880
as Bruce Campbell or even worse or cooler than Bruce Campbell.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.160
Yeah, you're not that.

04:50.160 --> 04:54.080
You want to be reasonably complimentary.

04:54.720 --> 04:56.160
You want to be like, I love your work.

04:57.360 --> 04:58.800
Keep up the good stuff.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.160
See you later.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.680
That's it. That's all you need to do.

05:01.680 --> 05:06.480
Mm-hmm. I do want to make a note about Felicia Day.

05:07.360 --> 05:08.720
That is a different situation.

05:08.720 --> 05:09.680
Just don't do that.

05:09.680 --> 05:10.800
Yeah, don't talk to her.

05:10.800 --> 05:11.840
Just don't talk to her.

05:12.400 --> 05:13.760
She gets that all the time.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.440
Let it go.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.400
But talk to Bruce Campbell.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.360
He seems all right.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.040
Felicia Day from everything I've heard is very nice.

05:19.040 --> 05:20.240
I haven't spoken to her.

05:20.240 --> 05:22.880
I'm sure she's very nice, but the odds are you're going to walk up

05:22.880 --> 05:26.080
and no matter what wonderful compliment you have formulated in your head,

05:26.080 --> 05:26.880
it's going to come out like this.

05:26.880 --> 05:31.600
Yeah, you're just going to start expectorating.

05:31.600 --> 05:31.920
Wow.

05:31.920 --> 05:34.640
Your hair is red.

05:34.640 --> 05:35.600
It's nice.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.920
Your pants like your toe.

05:39.360 --> 05:41.760
I recently moved to a new city to be with my girlfriend.

05:41.760 --> 05:42.800
Mistake?

05:42.800 --> 05:43.040
Yeah.

05:45.760 --> 05:47.360
There's like in parentheses, it doesn't.

05:47.360 --> 05:48.160
Mistake?

05:48.160 --> 05:48.400
Yes.

05:49.040 --> 05:52.240
At first it was difficult, but well, well.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.240
Wonder who could have told you that?

05:54.240 --> 05:56.080
Could it have been our first episode?

05:56.080 --> 05:56.480
Yep.

05:56.480 --> 05:59.120
At first it was difficult, but now things are going well

05:59.120 --> 06:02.000
and I've recently been hired on to do my dream job.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.960
However, the most important thing in my life,

06:04.960 --> 06:07.360
by which I mean my motivation, is this girl.

06:08.800 --> 06:12.800
She recently informed me that she's moving to a city an hour and a half away

06:12.800 --> 06:20.000
and said so nonchalantly as if it had not been a consideration

06:20.000 --> 06:22.240
in the decision making process.

06:22.240 --> 06:24.960
Is she packing her bags and moving away?

06:24.960 --> 06:25.920
Love this guy.

06:25.920 --> 06:28.960
Dude, she's giving you the Carmen Sandiego slip.

06:32.240 --> 06:34.480
She goes from Nashville to Norway.

06:35.680 --> 06:38.640
Hey, Ricky, where's Tracy?

06:38.640 --> 06:39.120
I don't know.

06:39.120 --> 06:40.480
I have to go buy an atlas.

06:41.520 --> 06:43.520
Hello, shoes.

06:43.520 --> 06:45.440
Where's your girlfriend?

06:45.440 --> 06:47.440
How familiar are you with country flags?

06:47.440 --> 06:50.720
Because I need someone who can identify them to find my girlfriend.

06:52.080 --> 06:54.960
Hey, first off, that's some cold shit.

06:54.960 --> 06:57.680
I just want to tell you that she's doing to you.

06:57.680 --> 07:02.240
So you moved to Nowheresville, Indiana,

07:02.240 --> 07:04.560
and she says, I'm moving an hour and a half away.

07:04.560 --> 07:07.040
Is that the way this shakes out?

07:07.040 --> 07:07.540
Really?

07:08.960 --> 07:12.880
I've got to tell you, dude, honestly, I love you

07:12.880 --> 07:16.560
because you listen to our show and I know that you love this girl.

07:18.880 --> 07:23.440
That doesn't sound like the actions of somebody who cares enough about you.

07:23.440 --> 07:25.120
No, especially to drop it.

07:25.120 --> 07:29.120
It's one thing to be like, listen, I've had this opportunity come up.

07:29.680 --> 07:30.640
I can't turn it down.

07:30.640 --> 07:33.200
But you're just be like, oh, PS, I'm moving.

07:33.200 --> 07:34.640
Peace, like.

07:34.640 --> 07:35.680
BT dubs.

07:35.680 --> 07:36.560
Yeah, that's right.

07:36.560 --> 07:38.640
The nonchalantly is what really bothers me.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.320
I mean, maybe she's, you know, I do that.

07:40.320 --> 07:42.960
I think everybody does that where you feel really bad about something.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.480
So it's not a big deal.

07:44.480 --> 07:47.520
It's not an effective defense mechanism in the slightest.

07:48.640 --> 07:50.240
But I've done it before.

07:50.240 --> 07:54.800
I mean, 90 minutes isn't isn't too bad.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.760
It's not like as far as long distance relationships goes, it's not too bad.

07:57.760 --> 08:00.960
But presumably the only one he knows there.

08:01.840 --> 08:02.560
Yeah.

08:02.560 --> 08:05.280
And also, he moved to a city to be with her.

08:05.280 --> 08:08.560
And then, yeah, like if they were in the same city to begin with,

08:08.560 --> 08:11.520
and then she moved an hour and a half away, no problem.

08:11.520 --> 08:15.600
But to him to relocate himself and then she moves away.

08:15.600 --> 08:18.160
Here's a little tough love.

08:18.160 --> 08:22.000
You might want to take a step back from the situation

08:22.000 --> 08:24.400
and kind of take stock of the relationship

08:24.400 --> 08:26.240
because you might be a little too close to it

08:26.240 --> 08:28.640
and it might not be going as well as you think.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.480
We got another email here.

08:34.480 --> 08:36.720
I keep moving away from my boyfriend.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.880
When is he going to and then he moves to where I am.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.400
When is he going to get it to hit?

08:40.400 --> 08:42.320
Love lost in Las Vegas.

08:42.320 --> 08:44.160
I say, you know,

08:44.160 --> 08:46.960
I say you just got hired to your dream job.

08:48.880 --> 08:51.040
It's time to make a new home an hour and a half away

08:51.040 --> 08:53.120
from your ex-girlfriend.

08:53.120 --> 08:55.680
Yeah, you need some time for you.

08:55.680 --> 08:56.400
You really do.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.080
You need to take some time and see where it goes.

08:58.080 --> 08:58.960
Don't follow her again.

09:00.080 --> 09:02.560
If you want to like cool things off

09:02.560 --> 09:06.800
and see if it's still working out in a few months, cool.

09:06.800 --> 09:08.160
But you just got a good job.

09:08.160 --> 09:13.760
And you really, the fact that she would do that

09:13.760 --> 09:15.520
without really thinking about you that much,

09:16.320 --> 09:18.880
it doesn't, it's worrisome.

09:18.880 --> 09:19.520
Let's put it that way.

09:19.520 --> 09:20.240
It's worrisome.

09:20.240 --> 09:22.400
So take, I agree with Travis, take stock.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.560
Just bury yourself in your work

09:24.560 --> 09:26.720
because really work is the best girlfriend

09:26.720 --> 09:27.760
that a guy could ask for.

09:29.200 --> 09:33.440
I have 13 goddamn Yahoo answer questions.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.600
Let's just do them back to back to back to back to back.

09:35.600 --> 09:38.240
Yeah, let's kill ourselves.

09:38.240 --> 09:40.480
I think it'd be good to start out with this one.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.920
It was sent in by Randy May.

09:41.920 --> 09:43.040
Thank you, Randy May.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.200
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Sarah, who asks,

09:47.280 --> 09:50.240
why do I sleepwalk to the toilet, sit there and cry?

09:53.360 --> 09:54.560
Ever since I was a child,

09:54.560 --> 09:55.920
I would sleepwalk to the bathroom

09:55.920 --> 09:57.360
and just sit on the toilet,

09:57.360 --> 09:59.120
not going to the bathroom and cry.

09:59.840 --> 10:02.320
The thing is, I'm usually conscious of it.

10:02.320 --> 10:03.760
So am I sleepwalking?

10:03.760 --> 10:06.160
Why am I doing this?

10:06.160 --> 10:09.440
Hey, no, you're like really depressed.

10:09.440 --> 10:12.080
You're like, you've been super depressed your whole life.

10:12.080 --> 10:12.800
Your whole life.

10:13.360 --> 10:14.480
And this thing you're doing

10:14.480 --> 10:16.400
is the most depressing thing I've ever heard of.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.160
So it's like a cyclical.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.440
You're making yourself more depressed.

10:19.440 --> 10:20.800
You're not sleepwalking.

10:20.800 --> 10:21.360
You can't sleep.

10:21.360 --> 10:22.560
You're conscious.

10:22.560 --> 10:23.280
You're conscious.

10:24.400 --> 10:25.680
Sometimes I sleepwalk,

10:25.680 --> 10:28.000
but I didn't lay down to go to sleep,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.800
but I did this really super depressing thing.

10:30.800 --> 10:33.120
Um, everybody.

10:33.120 --> 10:33.600
Yeah.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.920
Everybody in the answers section agrees that,

10:36.640 --> 10:39.040
agrees that this is just stone cold depression.

10:39.040 --> 10:40.160
Can I just say right now,

10:40.160 --> 10:42.880
if you post a question on Yahoo Answers

10:42.880 --> 10:44.800
and everyone in the answers is like,

10:44.800 --> 10:49.200
uh, if everyone on Yahoo Answers

10:49.200 --> 10:50.640
isn't where you have a problem.

10:51.280 --> 10:52.320
Oh, bad news.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.600
If there's not one person in the answers who's like,

10:55.600 --> 10:57.200
no, there's completely normal.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.720
Then you've broken Yahoo Answers

10:58.720 --> 10:59.760
and it's time to stop.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.280
Cause there's some fucked up things

11:01.280 --> 11:03.440
that people will endorse on Yahoo Answers.

11:03.440 --> 11:04.560
It'll get raw in there.

11:04.560 --> 11:06.640
Yahoo Answers user Jeremy responded.

11:06.640 --> 11:08.960
It's probably hard gas and depression.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.760
Wait, hard gas?

11:11.760 --> 11:13.200
The least of combination.

11:15.280 --> 11:15.600
Oh no.

11:15.600 --> 11:16.160
Sounds bad.

11:17.520 --> 11:19.440
Thanks for coming into my office today, Fred.

11:19.440 --> 11:20.400
I've been listening to your stomach.

11:20.400 --> 11:21.680
Sounds like you got hard gas.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.560
That's where it crystallizes.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.480
We're going to get some little miners in there

11:26.480 --> 11:28.720
and really get that out for you.

11:28.720 --> 11:31.200
Hard gas is the hardest thing to deal with

11:31.200 --> 11:31.760
that you can have.

11:31.760 --> 11:32.720
It's harder than diamonds.

11:33.440 --> 11:34.240
Hard gas.

11:35.040 --> 11:36.560
What's wrong with you Yahoo Answers?

11:37.760 --> 11:40.800
So she, so she's, she goes to sleep

11:41.440 --> 11:44.240
and she says, I need a walk.

11:44.240 --> 11:47.840
I'm going to go to the toilet and sit on it and cry.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.120
But she's not asleep is the thing.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.880
Is the thing is she's not asleep.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.400
That's not sleepwalking.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.920
She's just unconsciously,

11:55.920 --> 11:58.560
she's just like, you know, you do that from time to time.

11:58.560 --> 11:59.280
You time travel.

11:59.280 --> 12:01.120
You're like, oh, how did I, why am I doing this?

12:01.120 --> 12:04.320
Like how am I, why am I sitting on my porch?

12:04.320 --> 12:05.280
I'm not even wearing pants.

12:05.280 --> 12:06.000
What's going on?

12:07.520 --> 12:11.120
Maybe I went to like the worst hypnotist show ever.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.440
Every time you see Jay Leno's face,

12:17.440 --> 12:19.120
you will stand up from your bed.

12:19.120 --> 12:21.280
You will walk to your toilet and you will cry.

12:22.640 --> 12:25.120
To be fair, I do that every time I see Jay Leno's face.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.400
I see Jay Leno's face too.

12:26.960 --> 12:29.520
Hey, whenever I call a pizza place,

12:29.520 --> 12:31.840
the first thing they say is, how can I help you?

12:32.400 --> 12:34.800
I've gotten in the habit of saying, I'd like a pizza,

12:35.920 --> 12:38.720
but I'm beginning to think that sounds a little patronizing.

12:38.720 --> 12:40.400
Of course I'm ordering a pizza.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.640
When I call a restaurant with pizza in its name,

12:42.640 --> 12:44.480
what's the proper etiquette here?

12:44.480 --> 12:46.960
How do I get through the pizza ordering process quickly

12:46.960 --> 12:48.080
and without seem rude?

12:48.080 --> 12:49.280
Thanks, Caro.

12:50.080 --> 12:51.280
I like this one a lot.

12:51.280 --> 12:55.120
Travis, is it Caro or did you just paste it improperly?

12:55.120 --> 12:56.240
No, it's Caro.

12:56.240 --> 12:56.960
Okay, Caro.

12:57.520 --> 12:58.240
Not Carol.

12:58.240 --> 12:59.680
Um, no.

12:59.680 --> 13:04.320
I like that this is, uh, um, that's better than my usual,

13:04.320 --> 13:06.400
which is I say, any pies today?

13:08.160 --> 13:09.680
I just yell, zombie brah.

13:10.800 --> 13:11.520
Zombie brah.

13:14.080 --> 13:15.680
What's the za situation over there?

13:17.200 --> 13:18.480
I like this a lot.

13:18.480 --> 13:21.600
I think that when you, when you call, um, any,

13:21.600 --> 13:23.280
any sort of food business,

13:23.280 --> 13:26.160
you should explain as explicitly as, as possible,

13:26.160 --> 13:30.560
the, the steps, the processes that brought you to,

13:30.560 --> 13:34.560
to this phone call, like, hi, uh, Papa John's.

13:34.560 --> 13:35.840
This is Griffin.

13:35.840 --> 13:39.840
Um, I, I understand that you have pizza.

13:39.840 --> 13:40.800
I'm in need of pizza.

13:41.360 --> 13:44.160
Uh, I am calling your particular location

13:44.160 --> 13:45.520
because that's close to my apartment.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.760
And, uh, also I've heard great,

13:47.760 --> 13:49.360
great things about your garlic dipping sauce.

13:49.360 --> 13:52.320
So, uh, can we just begin the exchange right now?

13:52.320 --> 13:54.560
Or do you have, do you have any questions for me?

13:54.560 --> 13:56.640
I shouldn't, I shouldn't be so presumptuous.

13:57.280 --> 14:00.240
What are the possibilities that you could bring me a pizza?

14:00.240 --> 14:01.520
Do I need to come get the pizza?

14:01.520 --> 14:04.880
What is the pizza situation at your location?

14:06.000 --> 14:06.960
I don't want a pizza.

14:06.960 --> 14:09.680
What I'd like is a round crust with sauce,

14:09.680 --> 14:11.840
cheese, and toppings melted on top of it.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.120
Can you do that for me?

14:13.120 --> 14:14.240
Is that a possibility?

14:14.960 --> 14:17.040
Hey, uh, I gotta, I gotta tell you,

14:17.040 --> 14:18.880
this guy's working at the pizza place.

14:19.840 --> 14:22.480
There is not, like, you being expedient

14:22.480 --> 14:25.120
and efficient in your order

14:25.120 --> 14:26.800
is the least rude thing you could do.

14:26.800 --> 14:27.040
Yeah.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.200
Like, the last thing he wants to do

14:29.200 --> 14:31.280
is listen to you prattle on about,

14:31.280 --> 14:33.200
and hem and haw about, you know, how,

14:33.200 --> 14:34.640
what do you want to, what are you saying?

14:34.640 --> 14:35.760
Your pizza's great.

14:35.760 --> 14:36.480
I don't make it.

14:36.480 --> 14:37.760
I work in a chain.

14:37.760 --> 14:40.000
What I like to do is when they ask, how can I help you?

14:40.000 --> 14:42.080
I pretend like I've called OnStar

14:42.080 --> 14:43.360
and I've been in an accident.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.120
That's good.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.200
That's an efficient way of getting pizza.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.000
That's not gonna be awkward.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.520
How is this bad at getting pizza?

14:50.400 --> 14:52.800
So bad, but really great at getting out of cars.

14:54.800 --> 14:56.560
This is a, this is a total non sequitur,

14:56.560 --> 14:58.800
but I found, I came across this incredible thing

14:58.800 --> 15:01.280
on the internet that people have started doing

15:01.280 --> 15:04.000
where they write, whenever you order pizzas online,

15:04.640 --> 15:05.840
there's like a special field

15:05.840 --> 15:07.760
where you can write in, like, special requests

15:07.760 --> 15:10.000
and people have started asking, like,

15:10.000 --> 15:11.840
draw a wizard on the box

15:11.840 --> 15:14.240
and, like, sometimes you'll get somebody awesome

15:14.240 --> 15:17.120
who will, in fact, draw a wizard on the pizza box.

15:18.080 --> 15:20.720
So I wholly encourage people to start doing that.

15:20.720 --> 15:21.760
Do you think if you said,

15:22.400 --> 15:26.640
can you make me a happy face out of pepperonis?

15:26.640 --> 15:27.920
Yes, I think they could do that.

15:27.920 --> 15:28.240
Yeah.

15:28.240 --> 15:29.280
Oh, you know what else?

15:30.720 --> 15:36.960
Emailer, Caro, I have completely stopped using the phone

15:36.960 --> 15:37.920
for my pizza order.

15:37.920 --> 15:39.200
I mean, maybe if you're calling, like,

15:41.200 --> 15:43.200
you know, the local pizza joint,

15:43.200 --> 15:45.840
then this would be a different situation.

15:45.840 --> 15:50.560
But, like, Papa John's and Dominio's,

15:50.560 --> 15:53.040
they will, you just do that online.

15:53.040 --> 15:54.560
Do that on your computer.

15:54.560 --> 15:58.560
Dominio's has a tracking system that tells you

15:58.560 --> 16:01.040
who made your pizza and who is putting it in the oven.

16:01.040 --> 16:05.120
Yeah, like, what stage of its life cycle it's currently at.

16:05.120 --> 16:06.720
I wish it went further, actually.

16:06.720 --> 16:09.120
I wish it was, like, in your small intestines.

16:10.560 --> 16:11.680
Or into the past, like,

16:11.680 --> 16:14.560
Justin is thinking about ordering a pizza.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.640
Justin has a deep, deep pizza hunger.

16:18.880 --> 16:19.920
That's your intro.

16:19.920 --> 16:21.200
Hi, my name is Phillip.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.960
My pizza hunger is deep.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.800
I have a deep, rich pizza hunger.

16:25.440 --> 16:28.560
I got a vein of pizza need in me that goes way down.

16:30.400 --> 16:31.760
Do you guys sell pizza?

16:32.400 --> 16:33.920
Because you're called Pizza Hut.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.520
There's still a little confusion there.

16:37.520 --> 16:38.880
It's nebulous.

16:38.880 --> 16:40.320
It's nebulous on your pizza.

16:40.320 --> 16:43.280
So I guess what we've settled on is zombie, bro.

16:43.280 --> 16:44.880
I think that's still the best.

16:44.880 --> 16:45.760
Griffin, hit me.

16:45.760 --> 16:46.480
We need another one.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.560
Good, because I got them.

16:48.560 --> 16:49.920
I know, you know you got them.

16:52.720 --> 16:53.440
How about this?

16:53.440 --> 16:55.440
It was sent in by Emily Terrible.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.320
Thank you, Emily Terrible.

16:56.320 --> 16:59.760
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Drake H, who asks,

17:00.720 --> 17:03.120
need some good drug awareness slogans.

17:03.120 --> 17:03.760
10 points.

17:05.440 --> 17:06.560
Oh, I should explain.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.800
Yahoo Answers has this form of currency

17:08.800 --> 17:09.920
that I don't think I've ever discussed,

17:09.920 --> 17:13.040
but it's highly upsetting.

17:14.640 --> 17:16.400
I think like you can give people points

17:16.400 --> 17:17.600
for answering your questions.

17:17.600 --> 17:18.400
I don't know what you do.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.480
You spend those points on like kush balls?

17:20.480 --> 17:21.040
I don't know.

17:21.040 --> 17:21.760
I'll never know.

17:23.120 --> 17:25.920
Anyway, just need some good drug awareness slogans.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.360
It'll be better if they rhyme.

17:27.360 --> 17:28.480
10 points to the best one.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.080
That probably means the one with the most

17:30.080 --> 17:32.640
or the one with a really, really good one.

17:32.640 --> 17:33.280
Thanks, guys.

17:34.160 --> 17:38.560
The best answer is by Yahoo Answers user, A7X Rules,

17:38.560 --> 17:41.200
who says, for inhalants, you could get a picture

17:41.200 --> 17:43.280
of the big bad wolf huffing something

17:43.280 --> 17:44.800
and write he huffed and puffed

17:44.800 --> 17:46.400
and then a picture of a grave

17:46.400 --> 17:47.600
and underneath that, right?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.120
And he blew himself in.

17:53.120 --> 17:55.520
Or there's a whole website dedicated to it.

17:56.320 --> 17:58.000
Just say, no, I'm too good for drugs.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.040
Drug-free is the way to be.

17:59.040 --> 17:59.920
Don't choose the booze.

17:59.920 --> 18:01.360
If you choose the booze, you lose.

18:01.360 --> 18:02.400
What's your anti-drug?

18:02.400 --> 18:03.200
Stay alive.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.080
Don't drink and drive.

18:04.080 --> 18:06.320
Shoot up for the stars, not your arms.

18:06.320 --> 18:08.400
Smoking the dope won't help you breathe.

18:08.400 --> 18:10.240
You cope up with hope, down with dope.

18:10.240 --> 18:12.480
If you don't know jack, you won't smoke crack.

18:12.480 --> 18:13.120
This is your brain.

18:13.120 --> 18:14.080
This is your brain on drugs.

18:14.080 --> 18:14.720
Any questions?

18:14.720 --> 18:17.120
Drugs are retarded, so don't get started.

18:17.120 --> 18:18.080
Say not to pot.

18:18.080 --> 18:18.960
PCP bad for me.

18:18.960 --> 18:21.360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.280
Say not to pot?

18:23.280 --> 18:24.560
Hey, man, do you want some pot?

18:25.200 --> 18:25.700
Not.

18:27.120 --> 18:30.400
No, no, it's like a Wayne's World throwback.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.440
Hey, I'd love some pot.

18:32.240 --> 18:32.740
Not.

18:34.560 --> 18:35.920
PCP bad for me.

18:35.920 --> 18:37.360
I love that one.

18:37.360 --> 18:43.360
Because sometimes, like, I have a big PCP rock, a big vial of PCP juice.

18:43.360 --> 18:44.640
A big sack of PCP.

18:44.640 --> 18:46.240
A big strip of PCP.

18:46.240 --> 18:48.480
I have a container full of PCP.

18:48.480 --> 18:53.040
I have a container with PCP in its appropriate form in the appropriate amount to get me fucked

18:53.040 --> 18:53.540
up.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.520
And I think, is it?

18:55.520 --> 18:56.160
Can I?

18:56.160 --> 18:56.960
Should it?

18:56.960 --> 18:57.460
Do it?

18:58.400 --> 19:02.720
But then PCP bad for me just runs through my mind, and I fly away.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.120
Kiss meth mouth goodbye.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.480
Hugs not drugs.

19:06.480 --> 19:07.600
I'm above the influence.

19:08.160 --> 19:09.920
Pot makes your brain rot, so let's not.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.200
Get high on life, not on drugs.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.960
You don't need heroin to be a hero.

19:14.960 --> 19:15.600
Be aware.

19:15.600 --> 19:16.160
Don't share.

19:17.280 --> 19:17.780
What?

19:18.400 --> 19:19.360
Griffin, you are-

19:19.360 --> 19:20.800
Those are your drugs.

19:20.800 --> 19:24.640
Griffin, you're probably the best slam poet of our time.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.000
Do you think?

19:26.000 --> 19:29.600
I feel like, listening to you, I feel like I'm on Russell Simmons Deaf Poetry Jam.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.560
It's like a tri- it's transportive.

19:33.280 --> 19:34.240
Say not to pot?

19:34.240 --> 19:40.880
You can't just make things up, and then pretend that not is something you say to people.

19:40.880 --> 19:41.380
Yeah.

19:41.920 --> 19:45.120
You can't be like, say jeed to weed.

19:45.120 --> 19:46.320
Say what?

19:46.320 --> 19:50.720
The rest of that should be, say not to pot, and then get beat up because you're an idiot.

19:51.520 --> 19:56.080
If you say any of these things, you will get the shit beaten out of you.

19:56.080 --> 19:58.160
Like, hey, hey, hey buddy.

19:59.120 --> 20:04.000
You wanna, you wanna eat, do you wanna eat or snort or somehow imbibe this PCP?

20:04.000 --> 20:07.120
Uh, sorry guys.

20:07.680 --> 20:08.240
PCP?

20:09.040 --> 20:09.680
Bad for me.

20:10.320 --> 20:13.120
Do you wanna help me drink this empty squeeze it bottle of PCP?

20:15.120 --> 20:16.080
That's what they keep them in.

20:17.120 --> 20:18.560
They melt the top of the lighter.

20:19.920 --> 20:22.720
They drink to squeeze it, then they melt the top of the lighter.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.160
That's why it's so popular, it's a drug.

20:24.160 --> 20:24.640
It's because-

20:24.640 --> 20:25.840
They fill it with PCP.

20:25.840 --> 20:27.680
There's so much impetus to squeeze it.

20:29.920 --> 20:32.480
Who are these people that are constantly having to turn down drugs?

20:32.480 --> 20:35.200
And why can't they just say no?

20:36.080 --> 20:39.200
Is the dealer gonna be like, that wasn't creative enough, take this.

20:40.480 --> 20:41.040
Try again.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.280
I need to feel it.

20:43.280 --> 20:45.600
I need to feel that you really don't want my drugs that I bought.

20:46.720 --> 20:51.120
Could you, if only you had rhymed, I wouldn't be shoving this PCP in your mouth and eyes.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.240
Or possibly ears or nose.

20:54.240 --> 20:55.760
Or ears or nose.

20:55.760 --> 20:56.800
Perhaps butthole.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.640
I don't know how it's distributed.

20:58.640 --> 21:01.280
I don't know about PCP very well.

21:01.280 --> 21:03.360
Angel dust, Griffin, angel dust.

21:03.360 --> 21:03.920
Is that what it is?

21:04.480 --> 21:05.840
Yeah, you know, angel dust.

21:07.040 --> 21:07.920
Probably snort.

21:07.920 --> 21:08.960
That actually sounds kind of nice.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.240
But it's bad for you, don't forget.

21:12.240 --> 21:13.280
Ah, shit.

21:13.280 --> 21:17.040
Yeah, sometimes I get confused.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.120
I label my empty squeeze it bottles.

21:19.840 --> 21:21.360
Just say bad for me, honestly.

21:21.360 --> 21:24.080
Can we come up with anything for this person?

21:24.080 --> 21:26.640
Like, better than say not to pot?

21:27.280 --> 21:30.320
How about say yes to the dress?

21:30.320 --> 21:34.320
Because if you spend your money on dresses, you won't have any money for drugs.

21:34.320 --> 21:37.440
Yeah, all I can come up with is something like angel dust.

21:37.440 --> 21:39.680
It sounds really pleasant, but I'm going to have to pass.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.200
No, see, that's nice because I didn't know that before.

21:43.200 --> 21:48.000
I was literally 15 minutes away from going out to the street and finding some dust.

21:48.720 --> 21:52.240
I appreciate your offer of marijuana, my friend, but unfortunately,

21:52.240 --> 21:55.120
I'm going to have to pass because I have things to do today.

21:56.080 --> 21:56.640
What about I'm broke?

21:56.640 --> 21:58.480
By that point, you're just punched in the face.

21:58.480 --> 21:59.440
I'm broke?

21:59.440 --> 22:00.240
I'm broke.

22:00.240 --> 22:07.280
How about you holding, keep holding, and then you walk away.

22:07.280 --> 22:08.480
That's a pretty good one.

22:08.480 --> 22:10.560
I think that that would really shut him down.

22:11.520 --> 22:13.760
Hey, I'm a secret cop.

22:13.760 --> 22:14.800
A secret cop.

22:14.800 --> 22:15.680
Yeah, I'm a cop.

22:15.680 --> 22:17.440
That'll get you out of any of these.

22:17.440 --> 22:18.800
Let me tell you about Jesus.

22:19.760 --> 22:21.440
My dad, not angels.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.400
You're confused.

22:22.400 --> 22:23.200
My dad's a cop.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.000
That's how you turn any drug dealer down.

22:26.000 --> 22:26.640
My dad's a cop.

22:26.640 --> 22:28.960
Yeah, he's going to bust us.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.640
I think that this is an imagined situation.

22:32.640 --> 22:36.640
I don't think that there are these people who want to say no to drugs,

22:37.520 --> 22:40.160
but don't know how to do it.

22:41.200 --> 22:46.320
Who don't know how to come up with a good cover story for why they don't want to do drugs.

22:46.320 --> 22:49.440
Yeah, do you want to know how I say no to drugs when people offer them to me?

22:50.720 --> 22:51.440
Oh, no, thanks.

22:53.200 --> 22:53.760
That's it.

22:53.760 --> 22:55.120
That's all you have to do.

22:55.120 --> 22:56.640
Yeah, or maybe I'm cool.

22:57.280 --> 22:58.720
I'm cool, but you're the fool.

22:58.720 --> 22:59.280
Don't do drugs.

22:59.280 --> 23:00.880
I'll just keep drinking this whiskey.

23:00.880 --> 23:01.680
Thank you so much.

23:02.320 --> 23:03.760
That's what I usually say.

23:03.760 --> 23:05.840
I'm getting high on life, by which I mean whiskey.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.440
My friend wants to ask someone to Sadie's.

23:10.480 --> 23:11.600
What is that?

23:11.600 --> 23:12.960
Like Sadie Hawkins?

23:12.960 --> 23:13.520
Okay.

23:13.520 --> 23:14.720
Sorry, I didn't have that in my school.

23:14.720 --> 23:17.760
I grew up in the 50s and that had been antiquated for 30 years.

23:18.400 --> 23:21.120
She doesn't know what she should say.

23:21.120 --> 23:27.680
Her plan is to make a banner with a pickup line and the question to ask the guy to Sadie's

23:27.680 --> 23:29.600
and hang it from the top of the stairs at lunch.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.520
What should she put on there?

23:32.720 --> 23:33.520
Sorry about this.

23:34.240 --> 23:35.440
Any suggestions are welcome.

23:35.440 --> 23:38.640
If you come up with something inappropriate, she's willing to tape it up there and run

23:38.640 --> 23:40.080
off campus if necessary.

23:40.640 --> 23:40.960
Thanks.

23:41.840 --> 23:42.560
Shigatai.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.280
How about, hey, you're probably going to say no because of this banner.

23:47.280 --> 23:51.360
Hey, everything you just said sounds absolutely like the worst.

23:53.360 --> 23:54.480
Don't do any of that.

23:55.120 --> 23:57.040
You know what really makes someone want to go out with you?

23:57.040 --> 23:58.480
Public embarrassment.

23:58.480 --> 23:59.360
Humiliation.

24:00.320 --> 24:01.200
Hey, look over there.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.560
It's Banner Bob.

24:02.560 --> 24:06.720
Kid that people only know because they'll go on a banner about him.

24:06.720 --> 24:12.400
Just print out some four by sixes of his tiny dick and paste it on every single locker that

24:12.400 --> 24:12.960
you can find.

24:13.680 --> 24:14.880
This is Bob's dick.

24:14.880 --> 24:16.240
It's minuscule.

24:16.240 --> 24:17.920
Will he get a Sadie Hawkins with me?

24:17.920 --> 24:18.800
Not now.

24:18.800 --> 24:19.360
Probably.

24:22.320 --> 24:23.120
Oh, God.

24:23.120 --> 24:31.200
See, okay, girl, you are illustrating the classic men are from Mars, whoever from V is

24:31.200 --> 24:31.760
Conundrum.

24:31.760 --> 24:32.800
A girl would love that.

24:33.360 --> 24:34.960
That would be so romantic.

24:34.960 --> 24:36.240
She would love that.

24:36.240 --> 24:39.360
A guy that does not, he's not, no, don't do that.

24:39.360 --> 24:41.360
He's in a very delicate situation.

24:41.360 --> 24:42.240
He's in high school.

24:43.520 --> 24:44.720
Probably, presumably, right?

24:44.720 --> 24:47.120
I mean, high school, it seems like a Sadie Hawkins, right?

24:47.120 --> 24:47.840
High school.

24:47.840 --> 24:50.560
Well, she said run off campus or he said run off campus.

24:50.560 --> 24:54.800
And like, if I tried to run off my campus at Huntington High School, I would have been

24:54.800 --> 24:56.240
shot as I tried to leave the gate.

24:57.920 --> 24:58.560
Got a runner.

25:00.080 --> 25:01.040
My question is this.

25:04.080 --> 25:09.280
What possibly put your friend under the impression that she needed to do a big display?

25:09.280 --> 25:12.640
Why don't you just walk up to the dude and be like, hey, Sadie Hawkins, you down?

25:12.640 --> 25:15.440
Um, like, that's going to cover it.

25:15.440 --> 25:16.560
Yeah, that'll be plenty.

25:16.560 --> 25:18.320
That'll be plenty of interaction for this.

25:19.280 --> 25:21.120
Now doesn't even have to do that much.

25:21.120 --> 25:25.360
OK, but we are we are we're we are violating the premise of this question.

25:25.360 --> 25:27.280
She's hanging a banner up the banner.

25:27.280 --> 25:28.320
She bought the banner.

25:28.320 --> 25:31.920
OK, she's already prepaid on the banner.

25:31.920 --> 25:33.440
OK, she lost her receipt.

25:33.440 --> 25:35.840
She's already done three exchanges at Walmart this year.

25:35.840 --> 25:38.080
So it's not going back.

25:38.080 --> 25:38.640
Got to do it.

25:39.360 --> 25:40.320
What is the banner say?

25:40.320 --> 25:44.240
Um, you're the best I'm going to do.

25:44.240 --> 25:45.760
Let's go to Sadie Hawkins together.

25:47.120 --> 25:50.160
I still think sorry about all this would be really effective.

25:51.280 --> 25:52.720
Please don't read this banner.

25:52.720 --> 25:54.000
Let's go to Sadie Hawkins.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.240
What if you blame it on somebody he doesn't like?

25:57.600 --> 25:59.040
Carolyn put this banner up.

25:59.040 --> 26:00.880
So don't go to Sadie Hawkins with her.

26:00.880 --> 26:02.800
Go to Sadie Hawkins with me, your friend.

26:04.720 --> 26:08.000
What if you made one of those pictographs?

26:08.000 --> 26:08.800
Is that what it's called?

26:08.800 --> 26:11.360
One of the things that's like pictures with like, it's like a puzzle.

26:12.080 --> 26:13.040
A rebus.

26:13.040 --> 26:13.680
A rebus.

26:13.680 --> 26:15.040
So you have a rebus, right?

26:15.040 --> 26:19.120
But it's you just take a big picture of Stephen Hawking and you put it up there.

26:19.920 --> 26:26.400
So you put it up there and like you write minus T minus Tevin.

26:29.760 --> 26:32.640
I was much more interested in going to a Stephen Hawking's dance.

26:32.640 --> 26:36.640
Yeah, the good thing is lots of seating.

26:39.360 --> 26:40.640
Not a lot of talking.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.160
Not a lot of talking.

26:42.160 --> 26:46.000
And all of like the hip-hop, the shitty hip-hop music they play is run through a vocoder.

26:47.600 --> 26:48.560
Shorty got low.

26:54.240 --> 26:56.960
We're allowed to make fun of him because he's so goddamn smart.

26:56.960 --> 26:58.960
Yup, he's never gonna listen.

26:58.960 --> 27:02.560
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buttons hun.

27:03.600 --> 27:04.400
Here it is.

27:04.400 --> 27:06.640
Want to roll up to the Stephen Hawking's dance with me?

27:07.520 --> 27:09.840
Why don't you ask him to the Stephen Hawking's dance?

27:12.240 --> 27:15.920
Why don't you get Stephen Hawking to ask him to the Sadie Hawkins dance for you?

27:17.920 --> 27:18.800
Wait, where are you going?

27:18.800 --> 27:19.680
Come back.

27:19.680 --> 27:22.080
Just give me 21 minutes to type this out with my eye.

27:25.280 --> 27:25.920
Stop it.

27:25.920 --> 27:28.080
Is that what he does?

27:29.040 --> 27:30.160
Why don't you turn the banner?

27:30.160 --> 27:30.160
Why?

27:30.160 --> 27:31.120
I can make fun of him.

27:31.120 --> 27:32.720
He's like, he's succeeded.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.960
Sure, he ripped a hole in space with his thoughts, but listen.

27:40.080 --> 27:41.280
What if he does that to me?

27:41.280 --> 27:44.160
He uses his brain to kill me from far away.

27:44.160 --> 27:45.360
He almost certainly will.

27:46.320 --> 27:47.760
You've got this banner, right?

27:47.760 --> 27:49.520
That's what we're saying, that she has this banner.

27:51.040 --> 27:55.440
Why don't you not write something clever on it and hang it at the top of the stairs at lunch?

27:55.440 --> 27:57.920
Why don't you use it as some sort of makeshift net?

27:59.120 --> 28:00.240
Catch that boy.

28:00.240 --> 28:01.680
Catch that boy and bind him.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.520
Catch him, bind him, take him to the dance.

28:03.520 --> 28:06.160
I'm going to wrap you up like a mummy and you're going to be mine forever.

28:08.000 --> 28:08.800
Come on, mummy.

28:09.760 --> 28:13.680
Because what every guy is waiting for is to be wrapped up like a mummy.

28:13.680 --> 28:16.000
And then tag him and release him back into the water.

28:18.240 --> 28:18.880
Where's Rob?

28:18.880 --> 28:20.880
He looks like he's in science class right now.

28:20.880 --> 28:28.560
In six months, we'll pull him in and trim his nails and clean his teeth and see how he's doing.

28:28.560 --> 28:30.000
Well, I'm going to get him investigated.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.360
He'll eat me out of your hand.

28:33.360 --> 28:35.120
Hold a super donut out of your hand.

28:35.120 --> 28:35.920
He'll peck at it.

28:37.600 --> 28:38.240
Now he's sleepy.

28:38.240 --> 28:39.040
Who's sleepy?

28:39.040 --> 28:40.480
Now he's sleepy.

28:40.480 --> 28:41.520
How about a Yahoo?

28:41.520 --> 28:42.320
Yeah, perfect.

28:42.320 --> 28:42.640
Okay.

28:42.640 --> 28:44.560
This one was sent in by Jacob Blocker.

28:44.560 --> 28:45.760
Thank you, Jacob Blocker.

28:46.560 --> 28:48.880
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Holmes, who asks,

28:48.880 --> 28:50.720
Answering the phone while having sex.

28:50.720 --> 28:52.160
Super hot or really rude?

28:54.800 --> 28:57.680
That sounds like the headline of like a some sort of Dateline report.

28:57.680 --> 29:02.080
I'm sure at one point or another while you were all doing the deed, the phone rang.

29:02.080 --> 29:03.920
And that's where this question starts.

29:05.680 --> 29:06.720
Where does it end?

29:06.720 --> 29:07.920
No one knows.

29:07.920 --> 29:12.240
Is it super hot to answer the phone and pretend like nothing is going on while continuing to have

29:12.240 --> 29:15.680
sex, or is it unbelievably rude to even glance at the phone to see who it is?

29:15.680 --> 29:16.880
What more, answer it.

29:16.880 --> 29:20.560
I think we are all in agreement that texting during a dinner date is terrible manners,

29:20.560 --> 29:24.800
but why is it more acceptable during sex, considering sex is much more intimate than

29:24.800 --> 29:25.840
sharing a meal or a conversation?

29:25.840 --> 29:26.640
It's not!

29:26.640 --> 29:27.120
Your thoughts?

29:27.120 --> 29:29.120
You're a fucking psychopath, Hans.

29:29.120 --> 29:30.480
You're a fucking psycho.

29:30.480 --> 29:34.480
Who said- Why is it that everybody says it's cool to text during sex?

29:34.480 --> 29:36.400
Like, what are you talking about?

29:36.400 --> 29:37.360
That's not a thing.

29:37.360 --> 29:39.280
What reports are you reading?

29:39.280 --> 29:41.520
Yeah, according to the Hans Daily.

29:44.000 --> 29:44.720
If I ever-

29:44.720 --> 29:48.320
Texting was sexting, like that's what you thought sexting was.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.840
Everybody's talking about sexting right now.

29:49.840 --> 29:51.920
I guess it's all right to do, but it seems rude to me.

29:52.480 --> 29:57.280
Also, I just want to point out, I don't care how good a fucking actor you are.

29:57.280 --> 29:57.680
I'll know.

29:58.720 --> 30:00.320
Ain't no way you're pulling that off.

30:00.320 --> 30:02.240
You're not- Yeah, everybody knows.

30:02.240 --> 30:05.760
What's upsetting is that I probably wouldn't know, and like that's the most upsetting thought

30:05.760 --> 30:06.720
in my mind right now.

30:06.720 --> 30:10.640
So now whenever I have a conversation with anybody over the phone and I hear like a small

30:10.640 --> 30:14.880
lull, like the tiniest lull, I'm just going to assume that they're boning down.

30:16.320 --> 30:20.080
So this is- Okay, first off, I'll tell you what is sexy, Hans.

30:20.080 --> 30:22.080
Calling it doing the deed.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.400
That's really- That's so hot.

30:24.400 --> 30:29.040
What I love is a euphemism for sex that I'm pretty sure my gym teacher used when he was

30:29.040 --> 30:30.880
trying to explain it to boys and girls.

30:30.880 --> 30:34.000
When you say doing the deed, it makes it sound like you're committing a felony.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.640
Is it okay to answer the phone when making whoopee?

30:36.640 --> 30:42.080
That's either like a small, small boy or a dog or a corpse that you're doing the thing

30:42.080 --> 30:42.320
to.

30:42.320 --> 30:44.880
Later he did the deed.

30:46.560 --> 30:48.000
Don't know how else to put it than that.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
And he chopped him up and he buried him in a hole.

30:51.120 --> 30:53.120
So find him guilty, please.

30:53.120 --> 30:56.640
We got tons of evidence because he was talking on his goddamn cell phone.

30:57.280 --> 30:59.280
We've been tracing all his texts.

30:59.280 --> 31:03.040
His texts that he sent while having sex with people.

31:04.000 --> 31:04.640
What a weird-

31:04.640 --> 31:06.560
Chopping him up right now, lol.

31:07.440 --> 31:08.160
Loz.

31:08.160 --> 31:08.660
Loz.

31:09.840 --> 31:12.640
You know what's worse is that he probably doesn't have like an iPhone.

31:12.640 --> 31:17.280
He's probably got one of those old, like, Zack Morris giant cell phones.

31:17.280 --> 31:18.000
Time out!

31:18.720 --> 31:19.520
Hey, sweetheart.

31:19.520 --> 31:21.440
Sweetheart, can you unflip this for me?

31:21.440 --> 31:22.720
I need you to flip it open.

31:23.280 --> 31:26.640
I need to- And I need you to hold the pound key down while I press this letter so I can

31:26.640 --> 31:27.360
capitalize it.

31:28.240 --> 31:33.920
I mean, good for Hans to apparently have this as much like- He can just like focus on- He

31:33.920 --> 31:36.320
can do more than one thing at once whenever he's doing the deed.

31:36.320 --> 31:41.280
Like, how does that not demand all of your- How does that not demand all your attention?

31:41.280 --> 31:43.680
If it's not, then you're not a very considerate lover.

31:44.400 --> 31:48.000
Maybe, Hans, the problem is you're not a very considerate lover.

31:48.000 --> 31:55.200
Also, getting to have sex and getting somebody to call me to want to do something are two

31:55.200 --> 31:56.240
such rare events.

31:56.240 --> 31:57.760
I can't imagine them aligning.

32:00.160 --> 32:03.680
I just know that when I go into a movie, I turn off my cell phone so it's not to interrupt

32:03.680 --> 32:04.480
the other patrons.

32:04.480 --> 32:07.040
But when I'm having sex, I turn it all the way up.

32:08.800 --> 32:10.000
Sorry, other patron.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.200
It's just you and me now.

32:13.360 --> 32:14.080
I even tweet.

32:14.080 --> 32:15.920
I tweet my phone number like, give me a ring.

32:15.920 --> 32:16.720
About to get it on.

32:18.320 --> 32:19.920
Nothing hotter than that.

32:19.920 --> 32:21.040
Hit me up.

32:21.040 --> 32:25.520
When you call the My Brother, My Brother, Me voicemail, I guess it can't- That doesn't

32:25.520 --> 32:27.200
work because it happens on the internet.

32:27.200 --> 32:29.360
Yeah, it's gross also to think about.

32:29.360 --> 32:30.960
But just, you know, chances are.

32:30.960 --> 32:31.520
Chances are.

32:31.520 --> 32:33.680
I fuck all the time.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.400
Just 26, 7.

32:37.200 --> 32:38.320
Oh, because he's in Chicago.

32:38.320 --> 32:40.240
He's got that extra hour in that different time zone.

32:40.960 --> 32:44.160
How much does age matter in a relationship?

32:44.160 --> 32:48.640
I'm 22 and I work with a 35 year old that I am crushing on hardcore.

32:49.280 --> 32:52.960
I think the only reason that we aren't sleeping together right now is because he thinks I

32:52.960 --> 32:53.520
am too young.

32:54.080 --> 32:54.480
Thoughts?

32:55.680 --> 32:56.720
Well, you are too young.

32:56.720 --> 32:57.520
You are too young.

32:57.520 --> 32:58.240
That's gross.

32:58.240 --> 33:01.840
22 and 35?

33:01.840 --> 33:03.920
I think it's once it's half your age.

33:03.920 --> 33:06.960
If half your age is the difference between, I think that's-

33:06.960 --> 33:08.160
But that's so he's cool?

33:08.880 --> 33:10.160
No, I'm saying he's not cool.

33:10.160 --> 33:11.840
I'm saying that's more than half your age.

33:12.480 --> 33:15.360
If half of his age is 11, right?

33:15.360 --> 33:17.760
Half of his age is 35.

33:20.400 --> 33:22.800
So adding 11 to 22 is 33.

33:24.000 --> 33:24.720
Right?

33:24.720 --> 33:26.000
You're too young.

33:26.000 --> 33:26.960
You're too young.

33:26.960 --> 33:28.240
He's gonna hurt you.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.760
He knows so much more shit than you do.

33:30.800 --> 33:35.600
I mean, if you're mature enough to enjoy the taste of a vine-ripened 30 plus man,

33:37.760 --> 33:39.840
I'd say that you are pretty mature.

33:39.840 --> 33:41.360
Don't listen to Travis.

33:41.360 --> 33:44.000
Us 30 plus guys have to stick together.

33:44.000 --> 33:49.040
His jaundiced, sun-stained, wrinkly old skin.

33:49.040 --> 33:52.960
There's no one- I think once you hit 30 plus, you assume that no one wants to have sex with

33:52.960 --> 33:53.040
you.

33:53.040 --> 33:54.480
Maybe you need to be more explicit.

33:54.480 --> 33:58.480
And just go up to him and say, hey, oldie, let's do this.

34:00.000 --> 34:00.720
Hey.

34:00.720 --> 34:01.520
Hang a banner.

34:02.800 --> 34:05.280
Ready to be a statistical improbability?

34:05.280 --> 34:06.160
Have some sex.

34:08.160 --> 34:09.600
This is a sexy episode.

34:09.600 --> 34:11.200
It is not a lot of sex in this episode.

34:11.200 --> 34:12.080
It's just right.

34:12.080 --> 34:14.480
A lot of people want to have sex, but not able to work it out.

34:14.480 --> 34:15.440
Or a pizza.

34:15.440 --> 34:17.840
They just can't seem to make the initial connection.

34:17.840 --> 34:19.520
Sagging with sex juice.

34:19.520 --> 34:27.440
Hey, yeah, I'd like extra cheese, pepperoni, and sagging with sex juice.

34:29.280 --> 34:30.080
Is this weird?

34:30.080 --> 34:31.600
Is this a weird conversation we're having?

34:31.600 --> 34:36.160
I was looking for a less awkward way to order pizza, and the podcast I listened to said,

34:36.160 --> 34:39.760
I should order it with sex juice so that we'd have a good laugh about it.

34:39.760 --> 34:41.360
Sex juice and angel dust.

34:43.040 --> 34:45.520
That is my favorite Cary Grant movie, though.

34:45.520 --> 34:50.240
I still have like a dozen yahoos.

34:50.240 --> 34:51.280
Okay, do another one.

34:51.280 --> 34:52.240
Okay, do another one.

34:52.800 --> 34:56.320
Wait, are we, I mean, did we help 22 and 35 out enough?

34:56.320 --> 34:57.040
Just go for it.

34:57.040 --> 35:01.520
He wants to, he wants to, he wants you on and around him.

35:01.520 --> 35:02.080
Just go for it.

35:03.120 --> 35:07.120
The short answer is age doesn't matter in a relationship unless it does matter in a relationship.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.320
Like, if it doesn't matter to either one of you, it's not a problem.

35:10.320 --> 35:11.840
If it matters to him, then it's a problem.

35:12.400 --> 35:14.080
He doesn't think you're too young, trust me.

35:14.080 --> 35:17.600
I think, I mean, he's just scared.

35:17.600 --> 35:18.960
Long as he's not married.

35:18.960 --> 35:19.920
Long as he's not married.

35:19.920 --> 35:21.200
You don't want to be a homewrecker.

35:21.200 --> 35:21.840
Unless he is.

35:22.480 --> 35:26.560
I feel like maybe I should just read like five or six of the headlines,

35:26.560 --> 35:27.920
and then you guys can tell me.

35:28.480 --> 35:29.760
Choose your adventure style.

35:29.760 --> 35:32.080
Which one we should, which one we should dip into.

35:32.080 --> 35:32.560
Okay.

35:32.560 --> 35:32.880
Do it.

35:32.880 --> 35:33.840
Does that sound acceptable?

35:35.680 --> 35:37.120
Okay, how about this?

35:37.120 --> 35:40.240
I'll just read them, and then I'll go into further detail when you decide.

35:40.240 --> 35:43.920
Question, who does Ash really kiss from Pokemon?

35:45.760 --> 35:47.440
Is it okay to cry after sex?

35:48.880 --> 35:50.960
How do you ask someone to model for you?

35:53.120 --> 35:56.160
Could an adult male survive on just breast milk?

35:58.560 --> 35:59.920
Can I lick my cat?

35:59.920 --> 36:01.120
I enjoy it, does he?

36:03.440 --> 36:06.880
Getting a tattoo soon, I know what I want, but could you guys help me with something?

36:06.880 --> 36:10.000
I need help naming my chinchilla breeding business.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.200
Okay, okay, all right.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.920
Could I legally hunt and kill a Sasquatch?

36:17.920 --> 36:21.120
Okay, I vote on the chinchilla business.

36:21.120 --> 36:22.240
Okay, chinchilla business.

36:22.240 --> 36:22.800
This is easy.

36:22.800 --> 36:24.000
We can knock this one out quick though.

36:24.000 --> 36:24.720
Okay, all right.

36:24.720 --> 36:26.560
Chinchis and a cinchi.

36:26.560 --> 36:27.040
What?

36:27.040 --> 36:28.960
This one was sent in by Matt Warren.

36:28.960 --> 36:29.600
Thank you, Matt Warren.

36:29.600 --> 36:31.280
It's by Yahoo Answers user Megan, who asked,

36:31.280 --> 36:34.480
I need help naming my chinchilla breeding business.

36:34.480 --> 36:34.960
Hello?

36:34.960 --> 36:38.640
I am looking into breeding chinchillas, but I need a name for my company.

36:38.640 --> 36:43.680
I want it to be something elegant and pretty, and the last word needs to be chinchillas or exotics.

36:43.680 --> 36:47.200
I don't want anything that says Megan's or Ontario's, etc.

36:47.200 --> 36:50.160
I also don't want silly names like chinny chin chins.

36:50.160 --> 36:51.600
That's the best.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.440
That's the best one, though.

36:53.440 --> 36:55.440
It needs to sound sophisticated.

36:55.440 --> 37:00.240
For example, some names I like are Blue Moon Chinchillas, Blue Moon Exotics,

37:00.240 --> 37:03.200
Autumn Breeze Chinchillas, Autumn Breeze Chinchillas,

37:03.200 --> 37:05.840
Autumn Breeze Chinchillas, Autumn Breeze Exotics,

37:05.840 --> 37:08.720
White Rose Chinchillas, White Rose Exotics.

37:08.720 --> 37:10.880
If you need any other information, just ask.

37:10.880 --> 37:15.360
Also, if you want to add in some possible chinchilla names, I wouldn't mind.

37:16.000 --> 37:16.720
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

37:16.720 --> 37:17.360
Bramble Pelt.

37:18.880 --> 37:21.280
Thanks for everything, Megan.

37:21.280 --> 37:22.000
Storm Scream.

37:23.840 --> 37:24.880
Night Shadow.

37:24.880 --> 37:28.880
Can I suggest Fluffy Rats Exotics?

37:28.880 --> 37:34.320
Because that says what they are without it coming right out and saying chinchillas.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.000
Chinchillas is a bit on the nose.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.240
Can I suggest Chin Deep?

37:38.240 --> 37:39.840
Chin Deep.

37:40.480 --> 37:42.720
Now, it does have to end with chinchillas or exotics.

37:42.720 --> 37:43.840
Those are the rules.

37:43.840 --> 37:45.120
Chin Deep Exotics?

37:45.120 --> 37:46.320
Oh, that's not good.

37:46.320 --> 37:47.520
That's not a good...

37:47.520 --> 37:50.720
That doesn't work for me at a few levels.

37:52.160 --> 37:55.680
That sounds like a website that opens up when you're on another website

37:55.680 --> 38:00.400
you shouldn't be on accidentally.

38:00.400 --> 38:01.600
Ready to go chin deep?

38:03.040 --> 38:04.640
How did you get chin deep?

38:07.360 --> 38:08.960
No one started dumping exotics.

38:08.960 --> 38:10.880
When it got waist deep, you weren't like, ow.

38:12.720 --> 38:14.000
It didn't happen all at once.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.640
I am chin deep in exotics right now.

38:16.640 --> 38:19.120
That pit of exotics doesn't look so deep.

38:19.120 --> 38:21.040
I'm going to jump in and just see how it goes.

38:21.920 --> 38:22.960
I'm chin deep.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.320
What about Speed Rats?

38:24.320 --> 38:26.160
Speed Rats.

38:26.160 --> 38:27.600
Because that's what chinchillas are.

38:27.600 --> 38:30.880
They're like rats, but they dart back and forth very quickly.

38:31.520 --> 38:32.560
Erotic exotics.

38:33.680 --> 38:35.760
Okay, now we're on to something.

38:35.760 --> 38:36.560
Yeah, that's good.

38:36.560 --> 38:38.240
It's got like a little flow to it.

38:38.240 --> 38:40.320
What about Mussolini's Chinchillas?

38:43.120 --> 38:44.800
I mean, you want something classy.

38:44.800 --> 38:45.680
Something classy.

38:46.800 --> 38:48.800
How about Sacco Chinchillas?

38:48.800 --> 38:50.240
Sacco Chinchillas.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.960
And then your best thing is like, you already have a gimmick.

38:52.960 --> 38:56.400
So like, people come in, you're like, how about a Sacco Chinchillas?

38:56.960 --> 39:01.120
And like, they can pay extra for the grab bag, and who knows what's in the grab bag.

39:01.120 --> 39:02.640
Spoiler alert, dead chinchillas.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.120
There's a good one.

39:05.120 --> 39:06.320
Dead chinchillas.

39:07.760 --> 39:10.160
People come in like, hey, what the fuck, man?

39:10.160 --> 39:12.880
And you're like, no, no, no, they're very much alive.

39:12.880 --> 39:13.520
Would you like one?

39:14.400 --> 39:15.440
It's pronounced the odd.

39:16.480 --> 39:18.400
How about Tiny Shitty Cats?

39:19.760 --> 39:20.560
Chinchillas.

39:20.560 --> 39:21.200
Exotics.

39:21.200 --> 39:21.700
Exotics.

39:22.640 --> 39:23.600
Exotics.

39:23.600 --> 39:27.120
Anytime you have like any pets smaller than a cat, just fuck you.

39:27.120 --> 39:28.080
Like, that's not a thing.

39:28.080 --> 39:29.280
Yeah, let's get out of here with that.

39:29.280 --> 39:31.280
Unless it's a ferret, which is like a long cat.

39:31.280 --> 39:32.640
I still don't like those.

39:32.640 --> 39:37.280
A friend of mine once told me that I shouldn't be afraid of his chinchilla

39:37.280 --> 39:41.120
because it has little raspberry eyes and it wouldn't hurt a flea.

39:41.120 --> 39:41.840
What does that mean?

39:41.840 --> 39:44.000
That's a weird name for a business.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.280
It has like segmented eyes?

39:45.840 --> 39:49.840
Yeah, no, it looks like a ra- I think it may be just the color of raspberry.

39:49.840 --> 39:51.200
I hope they don't have segmented eyes.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.480
That would be pretty much the worst.

39:55.520 --> 39:56.800
They could see you from all angles.

39:58.320 --> 39:59.520
There's gotta be something.

40:00.240 --> 40:00.880
I think we've got-

40:00.880 --> 40:03.440
Out of curiosity, are there any answers on that question?

40:03.440 --> 40:04.880
Yeah, there's gotta be some, right?

40:04.880 --> 40:06.240
I mean, they're all, but they're all very...

40:08.800 --> 40:11.120
How about Clueless Money Grubbers R Us?

40:11.680 --> 40:13.040
That's a little mean.

40:13.040 --> 40:13.680
Excuse me?

40:14.400 --> 40:16.720
Breeding any animals not a business or a company.

40:16.720 --> 40:19.920
They're not there for your profit.

40:19.920 --> 40:20.640
I'm ruining things.

40:21.280 --> 40:21.920
Oh, God.

40:22.400 --> 40:23.200
Oh, God.

40:23.200 --> 40:24.640
Ragged Telecaster says,

40:24.640 --> 40:27.680
I don't know about names, but I'll breed with your chinchillas if you like.

40:28.320 --> 40:29.280
Oh, no.

40:29.280 --> 40:29.780
Dude.

40:30.960 --> 40:31.200
What?

40:32.640 --> 40:33.680
What did you say to me?

40:34.960 --> 40:35.680
You'll breed-

40:38.240 --> 40:42.800
Here, hey, do it on site and call it the worst thing you've ever seen chinchillas.

40:43.760 --> 40:45.520
The island of Dr. Moreau chinchillas.

40:45.520 --> 40:47.200
Yeah.

40:47.200 --> 40:49.200
A nightmare circus sideshow.

40:49.920 --> 40:52.720
Everything you've ever feared in your life, chinchillas.

40:52.720 --> 40:53.200
How about just chinchilla-

40:53.200 --> 40:55.120
I want to buy a chinchilla, maybe want to die.

40:56.960 --> 40:58.800
How about loose and easy chinchillas?

41:00.400 --> 41:02.960
The sluttiest madam chinchillas.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.480
Madam chinchillas.

41:06.480 --> 41:08.560
Your first time around, you're gonna want Rosie.

41:10.080 --> 41:11.360
She breaks in the newbies.

41:11.920 --> 41:14.080
Yahoo Answers user EmeraldA responded,

41:14.080 --> 41:18.240
I like autumn breeze exotics, but I am thinking chinny chinny chill lala.

41:19.840 --> 41:23.680
Chinchilla cool cats or chinchilla CCs for short.

41:24.400 --> 41:25.760
Chinchilla CCs?

41:25.760 --> 41:26.400
What?

41:26.400 --> 41:29.840
It is good to start out the name with C because one of the first listed in directories.

41:29.840 --> 41:32.240
And how about chinny chilled out cats?

41:32.240 --> 41:33.040
Lol.

41:33.040 --> 41:35.440
What the fuck are you saying?

41:35.440 --> 41:37.200
Chinny chilled out cats?

41:38.000 --> 41:40.080
How about fun dip baseball disco dance?

41:40.080 --> 41:42.800
Like how about we just make a bunch of words

41:42.800 --> 41:44.880
that have nothing to do with the thing that she asked about.

41:45.920 --> 41:48.480
So he says you should pick something with a C

41:48.480 --> 41:50.320
because it's one of the first letters.

41:50.320 --> 41:52.320
Like you know the first one, right, dog?

41:54.720 --> 42:00.160
Yeah, maybe a few pages in the directory that precede chinny chilled out cats.

42:00.800 --> 42:01.520
You dumb fuck.

42:01.520 --> 42:04.880
To be fair, everyone knows everyone just skips right over A and B

42:04.880 --> 42:06.320
because those are for pussies.

42:06.320 --> 42:08.000
You got to go right into the C.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.520
That's where the meat of the matter is.

42:09.520 --> 42:10.800
Absolutely amazing.

42:10.800 --> 42:13.120
Chinny chin chinchilla cats.

42:13.680 --> 42:18.160
Aardvarks chin chinchillas for fuck's sake.

42:18.160 --> 42:19.680
This is what you call your business.

42:19.680 --> 42:22.160
Aardvarks and chinchillas and not aardvarks.

42:24.240 --> 42:29.120
Aardvarks, chinchillas, and just kidding about the aardvark exotics.

42:29.120 --> 42:34.320
Just do a rebus with a picture of an aardvark plus chinchilla minus aardvark.

42:34.320 --> 42:38.160
Because everybody knows that in the film book rebuses come first.

42:38.160 --> 42:42.320
Go on in and watch a grown man fucking chinchilla.

42:42.320 --> 42:45.040
I'm so glad we're back to back.

42:45.040 --> 42:47.040
The rebus for that is going to be a nightmare.

42:47.760 --> 42:50.080
Here at aardvarks, chinchillas, and not aardvarks.

42:50.800 --> 42:54.720
I came here to fuck aardvarks and chinchillas and we're fresh out of aardvarks.

43:00.160 --> 43:01.840
So this is misleading advertising.

43:02.480 --> 43:03.520
I'm also a lawyer.

43:03.520 --> 43:04.800
Good to see you.

43:04.800 --> 43:10.800
But first I am going to- I've heard good things about Rosie.

43:10.800 --> 43:11.760
Can you direct me to her?

43:13.200 --> 43:14.320
Goddamn slut rats.

43:15.360 --> 43:16.480
You're fooling nobody.

43:18.080 --> 43:19.520
I can't get past it.

43:19.520 --> 43:22.480
Nothing's funnier than a man having sex with a chinchilla.

43:22.480 --> 43:23.840
How am I going to top that with like-

43:23.840 --> 43:26.720
More like logistically perplexing.

43:26.720 --> 43:30.400
Yeah, all I can picture is that if that was as the business,

43:30.400 --> 43:34.880
watch a dude fucking chinchilla, it's just him waving and smiling at a crowd.

43:34.880 --> 43:36.480
And it's really messing with me.

43:36.480 --> 43:41.200
Dear Bob, do you and your chinchilla-sized wiener want to go to Sadie Hawkins with me?

43:42.080 --> 43:42.960
Get back of me.

43:42.960 --> 43:46.800
Here's a photo of reference for people who are not familiar with Bob.

43:46.800 --> 43:49.760
You said chinchilla-sized and I heard chinchilla-shaped.

43:52.080 --> 43:53.600
We have to move on.

43:53.600 --> 43:55.120
We can't legally.

43:55.760 --> 43:56.640
I'm stuck here.

43:56.640 --> 44:01.040
I'm stuck here, too many terrible images.

44:01.040 --> 44:05.520
Is it weird or gross when you answer your cell phone while on the toilet?

44:05.520 --> 44:06.880
My brother does that all the time.

44:06.880 --> 44:08.720
And when I tell him it's gross, he begs to differ.

44:09.360 --> 44:10.960
Yes, the end of the show.

44:10.960 --> 44:11.600
That was easy.

44:12.880 --> 44:13.680
Yeah, it is.

44:13.680 --> 44:14.720
Don't ever do that again.

44:16.160 --> 44:17.120
I mean, what's the fucking-

44:18.080 --> 44:21.040
What could possibly be ambiguous about this?

44:21.040 --> 44:24.320
There's nothing to debate on this question.

44:24.320 --> 44:25.280
It's gross.

44:25.280 --> 44:26.080
It's gross always.

44:26.080 --> 44:26.480
Unless.

44:27.040 --> 44:27.840
Unless.

44:27.840 --> 44:28.080
No.

44:28.880 --> 44:38.560
Unless you push it and answer your phone in a huge airport bathroom while everyone else is going.

44:38.560 --> 44:39.200
That's really good.

44:39.760 --> 44:42.800
Hey, Christy, it's Reggie.

44:42.800 --> 44:43.440
What's up?

44:43.440 --> 44:44.080
What are you doing?

44:44.080 --> 44:44.960
I'm just crying.

44:47.520 --> 44:48.400
How did I get here?

44:49.440 --> 44:51.520
Thank you for calling me and helping me snap out of it.

44:51.520 --> 44:52.960
Damn you, Mr. Mysterio.

44:52.960 --> 44:56.080
You got me again.

44:56.080 --> 44:57.680
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

44:57.680 --> 45:00.640
But first, housekeeping.

45:00.640 --> 45:07.680
If you want to listen to other shows, if you want to talk to like-minded individuals,

45:09.360 --> 45:14.880
anything you can dream of, mbmbam.com is our web address.

45:15.840 --> 45:20.240
Make sure you head over to the maximumfun.org forums.

45:20.240 --> 45:23.040
That's where everybody is talking.

45:23.040 --> 45:26.880
We've seen there have been a lot of mbmbam listeners who have made the pilgrimage over

45:26.880 --> 45:32.320
there and I just want to tell each and every one of you how just I'm legitimately super

45:32.320 --> 45:33.600
proud of every one of you.

45:34.960 --> 45:36.080
Yeah, scary.

45:36.080 --> 45:39.120
But just don't be afraid because you could do it.

45:39.120 --> 45:43.360
I noticed a little bit of hesitation in the first couple first couple weeks, but I think

45:43.360 --> 45:46.560
that I think that our communities are they're jelling.

45:46.560 --> 45:47.360
Yeah, they are jelling.

45:47.360 --> 45:52.720
And also there's a there's a post on the forum every week where people discuss the

45:52.720 --> 45:53.680
new show.

45:53.680 --> 45:58.720
Go there and like talk about it so we can beat those jerks that stop podcasting yourself.

45:58.720 --> 46:00.960
I want our forum to have more responses than theirs.

46:02.080 --> 46:03.520
Why are you so angry at them?

46:03.520 --> 46:04.080
I'm going to start.

46:04.080 --> 46:05.840
I need to start an imaginary.

46:05.840 --> 46:08.960
You know how like they say you go to prison and kill somebody the first day?

46:08.960 --> 46:10.560
It's the same principle.

46:11.760 --> 46:12.560
No, I love those guys.

46:12.560 --> 46:14.720
They just had their 150th show for them.

46:14.720 --> 46:15.760
Oh, congrats.

46:15.760 --> 46:16.000
I know.

46:16.000 --> 46:16.560
Congrats, guys.

46:16.560 --> 46:17.680
Mazel tov.

46:17.680 --> 46:19.040
That's a funny ass show.

46:19.040 --> 46:20.480
I feel like we should do a better job.

46:20.480 --> 46:22.720
Like, go listen to all the different Maximum Fun podcasts.

46:22.720 --> 46:24.560
They're all so, so incredible.

46:24.560 --> 46:25.200
Yeah, they're all great.

46:25.760 --> 46:28.880
We get questions all the time where people are like, well, I'm finally caught up on your

46:28.880 --> 46:29.440
show.

46:29.440 --> 46:32.000
What do I do now to wait till next Monday?

46:32.000 --> 46:36.640
Go to Maximumfun.org and listen to all of those shows.

46:36.640 --> 46:39.040
There's like hundreds of Jordan Jesse Goes.

46:39.040 --> 46:39.520
Yeah, there's.

46:39.520 --> 46:40.400
Jump on those.

46:40.400 --> 46:41.440
Stop podcasting yourself.

46:41.440 --> 46:42.480
Judge Jon Huntsman.

46:42.480 --> 46:45.600
Go listen to Jordan Jesse Go a bit where they're coming up with new

46:45.600 --> 46:50.400
new sci-fi channel movies that combine people with animals.

46:51.440 --> 46:52.400
One of them was Jose.

46:53.040 --> 46:54.320
Jose can snake.

46:56.880 --> 46:57.920
So go listen to those shows.

46:57.920 --> 46:58.800
You'll really enjoy them.

46:59.920 --> 47:03.520
If you would like to sponsor our show, we will.

47:03.520 --> 47:04.400
We will.

47:04.400 --> 47:06.880
We would love to have you on as a sponsor.

47:06.880 --> 47:08.800
We'll say whatever the hell you want us to.

47:08.800 --> 47:09.840
We're dirty like that.

47:10.640 --> 47:13.520
And you can like where the chinchillas of podcasting.

47:13.520 --> 47:14.800
We are the chinchillas of pocket.

47:14.800 --> 47:15.840
That was our original title.

47:17.040 --> 47:18.400
The email Teresa.

47:18.400 --> 47:19.840
That's with an H, correct?

47:19.840 --> 47:20.800
That is correct.

47:20.800 --> 47:24.880
At Maximumfun.org and tell her, hey, I want to get on board with those guys.

47:26.240 --> 47:26.880
It's affordable.

47:27.440 --> 47:27.760
It is.

47:29.040 --> 47:30.080
It's like a hundo.

47:30.080 --> 47:31.040
So get on board.

47:31.040 --> 47:33.840
Hundo for a personal message, 150 for a commercial message.

47:36.480 --> 47:38.080
I'd like to say a couple of special things.

47:38.080 --> 47:46.160
Um, one out to KSDB, the Wildcat 91.9, your antidote to commercial radio with hot Donna.

47:46.160 --> 47:47.200
That's good.

47:47.200 --> 47:48.000
What are you doing?

47:48.000 --> 47:48.160
Yeah.

47:48.160 --> 47:48.800
You like that?

47:48.800 --> 47:49.600
No, I like this.

47:50.160 --> 47:52.640
It's a Kansas state, uh, college radio station.

47:52.640 --> 47:56.960
Um, and hot Donna gave us a great shout out and recommended us to all the listeners.

47:56.960 --> 47:57.760
So can I wait?

47:57.760 --> 47:59.600
I want to give her a liner.

47:59.600 --> 48:00.400
I want to give her a letter.

48:01.760 --> 48:05.120
Hey, you're listening to KSDB, the Wildcat 91.9.

48:05.120 --> 48:08.480
Your antidote to commercial radio with hot Donna.

48:10.240 --> 48:12.640
Worth its weight in gold.

48:12.640 --> 48:13.760
You're welcome hot Donna.

48:14.400 --> 48:16.880
Hey, this is my brother, my brother, me and Oasis.

48:16.880 --> 48:20.240
And you're listening to KSDB Wildcat.

48:20.240 --> 48:20.960
They're being quiet.

48:23.120 --> 48:24.400
We're here with Mark McGrath.

48:24.400 --> 48:26.880
Listen to the KSDB, the Wildcat 91.9.

48:26.880 --> 48:30.400
Can we go a week without a Mark McGrath reference?

48:30.400 --> 48:34.640
It's dated and like completely like why the fuck do we keep talking about this dude?

48:34.640 --> 48:35.360
I love him.

48:35.360 --> 48:36.080
I can't get enough.

48:36.080 --> 48:41.120
Hey, lock into KSDB, the Wildcat 91.9 and enjoy fucking that chinchilla.

48:42.720 --> 48:43.760
Break off the knob.

48:46.320 --> 48:51.680
Uh, so also a special thanks to Michael, Eric and Stephen for helping me out with a,

48:51.680 --> 48:53.520
with a project, uh, for work.

48:53.520 --> 48:54.800
They're very nice guys.

48:54.800 --> 49:01.440
Um, on Twitter, thank you to at Matt Murray for recommending us to your friend and at

49:01.440 --> 49:02.160
mad offer.

49:02.720 --> 49:04.160
Sorry about fart touch.

49:04.160 --> 49:06.000
I just kind of want to apologize to everyone.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.720
It's like a blanket apology for touching.

49:08.720 --> 49:13.360
I feel like fucking Pandora and I opened a box and let fart touch out and I've ruined

49:13.360 --> 49:13.840
lives.

49:13.840 --> 49:14.880
Yeah, you can't put that back.

49:15.520 --> 49:17.120
I'm so very sorry.

49:17.120 --> 49:19.040
Master Stealth on YouTube.

49:19.680 --> 49:24.080
He created a video to help introduce, um, new listeners.

49:24.080 --> 49:25.520
So, you know, check it out.

49:25.520 --> 49:28.000
It's all about the people's nasty gum bit.

49:28.640 --> 49:30.800
Um, so thank you much.

49:30.800 --> 49:33.360
If you search MBM on YouTube, you find a lot of clips.

49:33.360 --> 49:36.080
That's a good way to introduce people to show say, Hey, let's do the show.

49:36.080 --> 49:36.960
Here's a bit.

49:36.960 --> 49:37.440
Here's a bit.

49:37.440 --> 49:37.840
They do.

49:37.840 --> 49:38.800
There's a classic bit.

49:38.800 --> 49:39.920
One of the recurring bits.

49:40.560 --> 49:43.440
We don't actually have those, but it would be nice if we did, you know, we need to bring

49:43.440 --> 49:48.320
back, you know, it's coming back in fashion for the, for the new spring season listening

49:48.320 --> 49:49.280
parties.

49:49.280 --> 49:50.720
Ooh, listening parties.

49:50.720 --> 49:54.000
We, this for our, for our new listeners, we used to do this thing and we still do it.

49:54.000 --> 49:57.840
We just, not a lot of people have requested them where, uh, if you get together with a

49:57.840 --> 49:59.440
group of friends, what was our ruling?

49:59.440 --> 50:00.320
Was it four?

50:00.960 --> 50:02.960
We said it's two for God.

50:02.960 --> 50:04.080
So four for us.

50:04.080 --> 50:05.280
Cause it's okay.

50:05.280 --> 50:08.560
So, you know, four more gathered in our name.

50:08.560 --> 50:11.680
Preferably some people who've never, maybe, maybe a couple of people who'd never heard

50:11.680 --> 50:12.560
the show before.

50:12.560 --> 50:18.160
Um, but you, uh, yeah, you guys, you get together with them, uh, and you, you schedule a listening

50:18.160 --> 50:22.800
party and you send us an email with explicitly stating this is for the listening party.

50:22.800 --> 50:26.640
Uh, and we will record you a brief private message, which we will send to you.

50:26.640 --> 50:30.640
Tell us as much about the party as you can so we can try to make it, you know, it's

50:30.640 --> 50:31.200
personal.

50:31.200 --> 50:34.960
Yeah, it's important that afterward we need pics or it didn't happen.

50:35.760 --> 50:36.880
Photographic evidence.

50:36.880 --> 50:44.560
Uh, if you need a template, uh, just check out the mod locks because, uh, dude's still

50:44.560 --> 50:47.040
repping the set after what?

50:47.040 --> 50:51.680
Like five months, nothing, but nonstop parties like party 17 or something.

50:51.680 --> 50:55.280
Yeah, it's completely, it's sickening, but like in a good way, sickening in a good way.

50:55.280 --> 50:56.000
No, I'm thank you.

50:56.000 --> 50:56.880
I'm I'm sick.

50:57.840 --> 50:59.120
And I think that's it, right?

50:59.120 --> 51:01.200
That's all of our garbage we have to do.

51:01.200 --> 51:02.800
All of our housekeeping.

51:02.800 --> 51:04.960
Uh, did you give out our email address?

51:04.960 --> 51:06.560

51:06.560 --> 51:07.440

Wow.

51:13.280 --> 51:13.760

51:14.480 --> 51:16.720
I don't think you got a single one of those.

51:16.720 --> 51:17.200
I don't.

51:17.200 --> 51:18.400
I don't actually know the number.

51:19.120 --> 51:22.400

51:23.120 --> 51:23.360
Okay.

51:23.360 --> 51:24.080
Oh, it's easy enough.

51:24.080 --> 51:25.440
That's easier than I made it out to be.

51:25.440 --> 51:26.080
I think.

51:26.080 --> 51:26.320
Yeah.

51:26.320 --> 51:28.800
Just call and leave us a message cause we like hearing your voices.

51:28.800 --> 51:30.640
Yeah, we just, we love you very much.

51:30.640 --> 51:33.280
Uh, so Griffin hit me with the last question.

51:33.280 --> 51:33.920
One to grow on.

51:33.920 --> 51:34.800
One to think about.

51:34.800 --> 51:35.280
Yeah.

51:35.280 --> 51:35.520
Yeah.

51:35.520 --> 51:37.280
This one was sent in by Donald Hawkins.

51:37.280 --> 51:38.400
Thank you, Donald.

51:38.400 --> 51:40.720
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Tommy Smith, who asks,

51:42.160 --> 51:45.600
can you help me stop thinking about Sonic the Hedgehog?

51:50.960 --> 51:52.000
He's Travis McElroy.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.200
He's Griffin McElroy.

51:53.200 --> 51:55.120
He's been my brother, my brother and me.

51:55.120 --> 51:55.760
Kiss your dad.

51:55.760 --> 52:01.200
This is going to wear on the lips.

52:01.200 --> 52:02.960
Keep your heart three stacks.

52:02.960 --> 52:04.000
Keep your heart.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.160
Hey, keep your heart three stacks.

52:06.160 --> 52:07.120
Keep your heart.

52:07.120 --> 52:09.120
Man, these girls are smart three stacks.

52:09.120 --> 52:10.240
These girls are smart.

52:10.240 --> 52:27.200
Play your part, play your part.
