WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.360 --> 00:16.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:16.000 --> 00:30.880
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.880 --> 00:50.560
Nobody that can't believe Jamaica's got a running team. Ladies and gentlemen,

00:51.280 --> 00:58.400
against all odds and probably, Jamaica has won the little country that could.

00:58.400 --> 01:05.760
Jamaica has won all three medals in the 200 meter dash.

01:05.760 --> 01:11.680
It's a real underdog story, Justin, because of course the favorite was the runner from Switzerland.

01:11.680 --> 01:13.360
Sure, right, because of the hills.

01:13.360 --> 01:16.080
Yeah, and barely got beat out by the Jamaican three.

01:16.080 --> 01:23.040
Now, you don't think about that, but it is hard to learn how to run without certain natural

01:23.040 --> 01:26.960
aspects of the environment, like hills, like the snow makes it hard.

01:26.960 --> 01:28.000
Like ground.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.360
You gotta train your legs, your glutes, and your crutes

01:31.360 --> 01:34.400
to really get your legs up and over those snow mounds.

01:34.400 --> 01:38.000
Now, Travis, I understand that this Jamaican running team, which did take

01:38.000 --> 01:45.200
all three medals in the 200 meter dash, I understand it was coached by John Candy.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.120
Now, how and or why?

01:47.120 --> 01:52.160
Well, how is the big question here, Justin, because as you know, he's dead.

01:52.160 --> 01:52.800
Sure, right.

01:52.800 --> 01:55.760
And he's been dead for quite some time now, so mostly they just watch

01:55.760 --> 01:59.280
Wagons East over and over and over again while they were running.

01:59.280 --> 02:04.080
They set up like a vid screen in their running complex to watch Wagons East.

02:04.080 --> 02:11.680
If you'll remember, there is that one scene in Wagons East where John Candy and Matthew Perry

02:11.680 --> 02:12.960
have to run away.

02:12.960 --> 02:14.560
I'm not thinking of the right movie.

02:14.560 --> 02:16.240
Nope, not in the least.

02:16.240 --> 02:17.760
You're thinking of Shanghai Noon.

02:19.680 --> 02:21.280
Now, what movie is it that you're thinking of?

02:21.280 --> 02:23.120
You're thinking of Almost Heroes.

02:23.120 --> 02:23.840
Oh, no.

02:23.840 --> 02:24.480
Oh, my God.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.600
I made a Farley Candy goof.

02:27.600 --> 02:30.240
In case anyone was wondering, Almost Heroes was another movie poster

02:30.240 --> 02:32.000
I had on my wall for a long time.

02:32.000 --> 02:32.960
Let's be fair.

02:32.960 --> 02:34.960
First off, that's fucking bananas.

02:34.960 --> 02:36.000
But let's be fair.

02:37.520 --> 02:41.920
John Candy was a very, very fast man, very expedient.

02:41.920 --> 02:44.240
Yeah, for once so large, quite graceful.

02:44.240 --> 02:50.080
In his prime, which is to say when he was alive, John Candy could hoof it.

02:50.080 --> 02:54.000
Mm-hmm, this is my brother-by-brother meeting advice show for the modern era.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.840
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

02:55.840 --> 02:57.760
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.760
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

02:59.760 --> 03:01.360
God, I miss you, John Candy.

03:01.360 --> 03:02.560
I know, right?

03:02.560 --> 03:04.160
I genuinely do.

03:05.040 --> 03:10.880
Did you know that motherfucker shot his entire role in Home Alone in a single day?

03:11.600 --> 03:14.960
Did you know that almost his entire part was improvised?

03:14.960 --> 03:22.480
Jesus, that too, but still, one day in a, these Hollywood magic doesn't exist anymore

03:22.480 --> 03:27.360
because every single second of The Avengers took four whole weeks to shoot.

03:27.360 --> 03:27.600
That's true.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.120
Every second, every frame.

03:29.120 --> 03:30.080
That's true.

03:30.080 --> 03:35.360
Actually, at one point, Chris Helmsworth died and was replaced by his brother, Liam Helmsworth.

03:35.360 --> 03:35.760
Exactly.

03:35.760 --> 03:36.720
And no one noticed.

03:36.720 --> 03:37.040
No one noticed.

03:37.040 --> 03:38.000
Nobody even noticed.

03:38.640 --> 03:40.640
Do you think that'll happen to one of us someday?

03:42.640 --> 03:44.720
Griffin, I can't be sure it hasn't already.

03:44.720 --> 03:45.440
It's true.

03:45.440 --> 03:46.640
We all look so similar.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.560
With podcast magic these days.

03:48.560 --> 03:49.680
Yeah, that's a good point.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.080
Let's get right into the advice.

03:52.080 --> 03:55.360
How do you break up with someone you aren't at something?

03:55.360 --> 03:56.080
Okay, that's easy.

03:56.720 --> 03:57.840
Sorry, Desk.

03:57.840 --> 03:58.960
I'm out of here.

03:58.960 --> 03:59.360
Sorry.

03:59.360 --> 04:00.960
We had a good run, Coffee Mug.

04:02.080 --> 04:05.600
You can tell Griffin and I just named the four things our eyes laid on.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.760
This is how improvisational comedy happens.

04:09.600 --> 04:12.240
Don't say no and just name the things that you see in front of you.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.160
Those are the two things.

04:14.160 --> 04:14.960
Recite them.

04:14.960 --> 04:17.520
Yes, and I see a cupholder.

04:18.320 --> 04:21.040
How do you break up with someone you aren't actually dating?

04:21.040 --> 04:24.480
I connected with the gentleman on an online dating site.

04:24.480 --> 04:27.680
We started texting and went out on one coffee date.

04:27.680 --> 04:32.400
Then he started texting me all the time, making plans way too far in the future.

04:32.400 --> 04:34.720
Like where would we go for Christmas dinner?

04:34.720 --> 04:35.200
Oh no.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.960
He even sent flowers to my office.

04:39.680 --> 04:43.040
I tried to tell him he was coming on too strong, but to no avail.

04:43.040 --> 04:47.040
How could I break it off with him when it was never really on?

04:47.600 --> 04:50.400
That's from mystified miss in the Midwest.

04:50.400 --> 04:53.120
I could probably shed some light on this situation,

04:53.120 --> 04:58.720
being probably the only one of the three of us who did this, who did the online dating.

04:58.720 --> 05:01.440
I didn't, I mean, not that I went straight up Christmas crazy, but-

05:01.440 --> 05:04.160
Okay, I thought that's what you were saying.

05:04.160 --> 05:06.640
I don't like to think about where I'm having Christmas dinner.

05:06.640 --> 05:06.960
Yeah.

05:06.960 --> 05:07.440
Right.

05:07.440 --> 05:12.800
So what you do, and let me tell you from first-hand experience, it's very effective.

05:12.800 --> 05:16.480
Just don't ever respond to anything they say ever, ever again,

05:16.480 --> 05:21.360
because that's the real beauty of internet, is that you can just turn your-

05:21.360 --> 05:24.160
When I block somebody on Twitter, they die.

05:24.160 --> 05:25.120
Did you know that?

05:25.120 --> 05:26.480
I've heard that.

05:26.480 --> 05:27.520
They're dead.

05:27.520 --> 05:29.360
They are for all intents and purposes.

05:29.360 --> 05:34.160
If I never see or talk to you or experience you ever again, you're dead.

05:34.160 --> 05:34.960
And that's really the-

05:34.960 --> 05:36.160
But Griffin, you're dead.

05:36.160 --> 05:37.440
And that's really the-

05:37.440 --> 05:39.840
Here's the one thing about this question, though, that freaks me out,

05:39.840 --> 05:46.400
is that she could totally easily do that, but the gentleman has already sent flowers to her office.

05:46.400 --> 05:52.160
What if he just starts bombarding her cubicle with the teddy bears with hearts that say,

05:52.160 --> 05:54.000
why don't you tweet me anymore?

05:54.000 --> 06:01.200
Ah, that's the other beauty of online dating, Travis, is because this person is online dating,

06:01.200 --> 06:05.120
they are not going to be brave enough to do any of those things.

06:05.120 --> 06:07.840
So you are made in the shade.

06:07.840 --> 06:14.320
Just let this Adams half-life just decay slowly and then it's gone.

06:14.320 --> 06:15.360
What about the texts?

06:16.240 --> 06:17.760
The texts, not a big deal.

06:17.760 --> 06:18.960
They're not going to keep that up.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.480
He's got pride.

06:21.040 --> 06:23.840
He's not going to let 12 texts go unanswered.

06:23.840 --> 06:24.720
Maybe 10.

06:24.720 --> 06:26.960
You're suggesting full cold shoulder.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.960
I'm suggesting two cold shoulders.

06:28.960 --> 06:29.280
I know.

06:29.280 --> 06:30.560
This is what always happens to me.

06:30.560 --> 06:31.760
So wait a little while.

06:31.760 --> 06:32.800
Don't respond to them.

06:32.800 --> 06:37.120
And then in like a month, respond to one with, who is this?

06:37.120 --> 06:38.000
No, no, no.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.280
No, and I'll tell you why.

06:39.280 --> 06:43.040
Because whenever I get that text from someone, I always just assume that they've gotten a

06:43.040 --> 06:47.280
new phone and this is someone else who now has this phone number.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.200
That's like, it's Travis.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.080
And they're like, oh, okay.

06:52.080 --> 06:56.080
Wait, now how does it, I've never actually seen, Travis is in the same room as me.

06:56.080 --> 06:59.120
I've never been able to see one of these bad ideas formulated in person.

06:59.120 --> 07:04.640
Now, can you explain, what has helped by texting them, who is this?

07:04.640 --> 07:08.960
Then they get embarrassed and either think that you've forgotten about them or that you're

07:08.960 --> 07:10.960
somebody new and then they stop texting you.

07:10.960 --> 07:16.000
It's way better than a straight up denial and shoot down to pretend like you no longer

07:16.000 --> 07:17.120
know who they are.

07:17.120 --> 07:22.320
Justin, I imagine that when Travis is formulating one of these things, like a thick cloud of

07:22.320 --> 07:30.960
purple dumb smoke, like comes out of his mouth and ears and just envelops his entire body

07:30.960 --> 07:31.680
forming a cocoon of idiocy.

07:31.680 --> 07:37.520
Here's the weird thing, you guys are not going to believe this, but steam just pours

07:37.520 --> 07:38.320
out of his ears.

07:40.320 --> 07:42.320
He looks like Herman Munster, it's bizarre.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.000
You said you'd never tell anyone that.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.600
Don't rub the salt in the wound, just let him die.

07:49.600 --> 07:55.840
Well, it depends, but I'm just saying it depends on how quickly he picks up on it.

07:55.840 --> 08:00.000
If after like three texts and no response and like you blocking him on stuff, he's like,

08:00.000 --> 08:01.520
okay, great, I get it.

08:01.520 --> 08:05.920
I'm saying if he's still texting you like four times a day, every day for like two months,

08:07.040 --> 08:11.200
you can't just assume that he's going to get the hint and stop contacting you.

08:11.200 --> 08:11.840
Yeah.

08:11.840 --> 08:12.960
You got to do something.

08:12.960 --> 08:16.480
You got to step up and I mean, at some point you might just have to say, if it gets to

08:16.480 --> 08:19.920
that point, just say like, Hey, I, this is done.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.120
This isn't going anywhere.

08:21.120 --> 08:22.720
This was never anything.

08:22.720 --> 08:24.000
Please don't contact me anymore.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.240
Oh, can we, uh, can we do a sidebar?

08:26.240 --> 08:26.480
Sure.

08:27.600 --> 08:33.360
Uh, this is, this is for the person on the other end of this question, which is to say

08:33.360 --> 08:35.840
probably a few of our listeners, probably a lot of our listeners.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.800
If you're online dating, this is the worst.

08:39.600 --> 08:42.080
This is the, this is the worst period.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.040
That's the end of the sentence.

08:43.840 --> 08:44.640
That's the whole thing.

08:44.640 --> 08:49.040
Don't do this. You've done it all wrong from, from a to Z.

08:49.040 --> 08:53.760
As cool as you need to play it with regular dating, you need to play it

08:54.320 --> 08:59.200
900 times cooler when you're, when you're, when you're doing that online stuff.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.240
Now, why is that Griffin?

09:00.880 --> 09:05.680
Because, because people, when they meet online, they're like skittish little birds.

09:06.240 --> 09:07.360
They're like little birds.

09:07.360 --> 09:11.440
And if you try and squeeze them too tight in your hand, they will die in your hand.

09:11.440 --> 09:14.800
They're leasing birds because you love them so much.

09:14.800 --> 09:20.560
Now at the beginning, because at the beginning you are distracted by the fact that,

09:21.920 --> 09:27.200
you know, your, your, your relationship is built on a pretty thin basis,

09:27.200 --> 09:29.760
which is a computer thought we'd love each other.

09:29.760 --> 09:30.160
Yeah.

09:30.160 --> 09:33.360
And I mean, eventually you'll have more to go on than that, but that's a pretty-

09:33.360 --> 09:37.040
But based on, based on like my Amazon suggested buys,

09:37.040 --> 09:40.800
like a computer I think is able to make that decision for us now.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.160
Oh, no doubt.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.440
I think a computer is there.

09:44.160 --> 09:50.000
But what's great is on that first date, you have the option of just getting up and leaving

09:50.000 --> 09:54.080
just late and then like not having to worry about it ever again.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.720
It's one of my favorite things about the website.

09:56.720 --> 09:57.040
Okay.

09:57.040 --> 09:57.440
Cupid.

09:57.440 --> 10:01.760
Cause it's built into the name of your acceptance of whatever the website tells you to do.

10:01.760 --> 10:02.400
Yeah, sure.

10:02.400 --> 10:02.800
Okay.

10:02.800 --> 10:03.280
Cupid.

10:03.280 --> 10:04.400
Whatever you say.

10:04.400 --> 10:05.040
All right.

10:05.040 --> 10:06.080
You're driving this train.

10:06.640 --> 10:06.800
Yeah.

10:07.360 --> 10:08.160
Keep it cool.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.880
Don't, just don't text.

10:10.880 --> 10:11.760
Don't, just don't-

10:11.760 --> 10:14.240
Don't bring up the words Christmas dinner ever again.

10:14.240 --> 10:19.120
Don't mention, when you are on a blind online date, holidays do not exist.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.120
Neither do your family.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.120
Living that, living this moment.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.480
Keep it super fish.

10:24.480 --> 10:25.840
What you talking about?

10:25.840 --> 10:27.200
What you're eating and drinking.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.000
That's the only few things-

10:28.000 --> 10:29.520
How about those Olympics?

10:29.520 --> 10:30.000
Use it.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.120
I'm giving that to you.

10:31.120 --> 10:33.120
Once she's done eating her dinner, it's gone.

10:33.120 --> 10:33.840
It never happened.

10:33.840 --> 10:39.440
She might, you might need to eat a second dinner to really commit to how in the moment you're going to be.

10:39.440 --> 10:47.280
Now, if you're in your fifties or sixties, everything I just said out the window, first date, start talking plans.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.720
Start figuring it out.

10:48.720 --> 10:50.320
Well, that's like old people catnip.

10:50.320 --> 10:51.280
They'll eat that up.

10:51.280 --> 10:52.320
Oh, they love that shit.

10:52.320 --> 10:52.880
They love it.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.160
It's old people optimism.

10:54.160 --> 10:55.040
They love that.

10:55.040 --> 10:55.520
Anything.

10:55.520 --> 10:57.520
You know how we've been around for Christmas?

10:57.520 --> 10:58.240
Let's talk about it.

10:58.240 --> 10:58.720
Yeah.

10:59.440 --> 11:01.040
I'm thinking about building a shed.

11:01.040 --> 11:02.160
Tell me more.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.280
How long is it going to take?

11:03.280 --> 11:04.560
Where are you going to get your supplies?

11:04.560 --> 11:05.600
The depot?

11:05.600 --> 11:07.520
You're going to totally be allowed to finish it.

11:07.520 --> 11:11.040
Griffin, I need a Yahoo answer question.

11:11.040 --> 11:11.600
Sure.

11:11.600 --> 11:12.880
Here's one.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.720
It was sent in by Spummy or Spumy.

11:14.720 --> 11:15.760
Still haven't decided.

11:15.760 --> 11:16.800
Thank you.

11:16.800 --> 11:17.360
It's by Yahoo.

11:17.360 --> 11:22.000
It's user Carly who asks, do teens in high school have parties like in Superbad?

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Because I have not once seen a party like that.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.760
I am a junior now and I haven't really seen it.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.520
Any of you guys been to parties like that?

11:29.520 --> 11:32.160
I'm not a mom pretending to be a kid at all.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.640
I'm not an undercover officer.

11:35.600 --> 11:38.400
Anybody seen any parties where underage kids are drinking?

11:39.120 --> 11:46.000
Can I tell you the best answer I have to this is that there's a sort of a fraternity row

11:46.000 --> 11:53.120
here in Huntington that I have driven past and I think that there have been parties like

11:53.120 --> 11:53.920
that in there.

11:53.920 --> 11:55.280
Like, it looks very fun.

11:55.280 --> 11:56.720
It looks like they're having a good time.

11:56.720 --> 11:58.080
I've seen these parties.

11:58.080 --> 12:03.440
I've seen the after effects of a party and believe that once there was a party there,

12:03.440 --> 12:05.280
but I've never actually caught it in the act.

12:05.280 --> 12:05.520
Right.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.880
Yeah, it's sort of like Oasis-like.

12:08.880 --> 12:11.040
When I approach a party like that, it dissipates.

12:11.040 --> 12:11.440
I don't know.

12:12.880 --> 12:13.280
I don't know.

12:13.280 --> 12:21.360
I think if everybody thinks back, I think everybody in their time goes to one party

12:21.360 --> 12:29.360
that is way cooler than they are and you realize it in that perfect moment, like, holy shit,

12:29.360 --> 12:36.480
I'm at a super bad party or an animal house party if you're not 12 and then you just try

12:36.480 --> 12:37.280
to live it up.

12:37.280 --> 12:42.480
You try to just, you try to experience it as hard as you possibly can because it's never,

12:42.480 --> 12:44.400
ever, ever going to happen again.

12:44.400 --> 12:45.360
It's like Narnia.

12:45.920 --> 12:48.000
Once you go back looking for it, it won't be there.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.200
I remember mine.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.160
I remember mine.

12:52.320 --> 12:54.560
We watched Jurassic Park and Laserdisc.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.360
Fuck me, Justin.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.880
That's the saddest thing.

12:58.880 --> 13:05.280
No, but later there was a, got pretty crazy because we watched a bootleg VHS of Into the

13:05.280 --> 13:06.000
Woods.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.400
Oh my Christ child.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.160
It got pretty good.

13:11.200 --> 13:11.920
Pretty good.

13:11.920 --> 13:14.400
I don't have to deal with Travis's disapproving looks.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.960
He's like actually physically here looking at me.

13:16.960 --> 13:20.880
See, this is great because the people at home don't know how hard I'm judging Justin right

13:20.880 --> 13:23.600
now to answer your question real hard.

13:23.600 --> 13:28.800
I think I went to one and I did not, it was like a friend of mine was like, let's go to

13:28.800 --> 13:29.600
this party.

13:29.600 --> 13:33.360
And I thought it was going to be like every other party I went to, but it ended up being

13:33.360 --> 13:38.480
like a full blown, our parents are like, his parents weren't even out of town.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.560
His parents were like, really asleep.

13:40.560 --> 13:44.640
His parents were like fucking going to see the lake house or something.

13:44.640 --> 13:49.360
And like, he was like, we got an hour and a half window while they're in trance by Keanu

13:49.360 --> 13:49.680
Reeves.

13:49.680 --> 13:50.240
Let's do this.

13:50.240 --> 13:53.680
Let's, you know, let's drink and let's hanky pank.

13:53.680 --> 13:58.240
And it actually got broken up by his parents while I was there.

13:58.240 --> 13:58.800
Oh my God.

13:58.800 --> 13:59.440
I swear to God.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.040
It's the only time that's ever happened to me.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.600
And it felt so, we left that party.

14:03.600 --> 14:05.360
I felt like some sort of conquering king.

14:06.480 --> 14:12.560
When I see that scene in any movie where like, you know, it's going to be pretty chill.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.480
I got cheese plate for me and my six friends.

14:14.480 --> 14:15.520
Is that all that is coming?

14:16.080 --> 14:22.800
And then it's like, cut to the whole house, like full of teens and somebody smashes a

14:22.800 --> 14:23.120
vase.

14:23.120 --> 14:25.360
And this scene is in basically every movie.

14:25.360 --> 14:27.760
There's like, you know, Hey, who are you?

14:27.760 --> 14:28.320
Dillop?

14:28.320 --> 14:29.600
No, I'm Phil.

14:29.600 --> 14:30.560
I live here.

14:30.560 --> 14:31.280
Okay, man.

14:31.280 --> 14:32.160
We're a party on.

14:32.720 --> 14:36.640
That scene is more terrifying to me than any horror film I've ever done.

14:36.640 --> 14:39.120
I cannot imagine.

14:39.120 --> 14:45.520
First off, it's bad enough that you're in a huge, huge party.

14:45.520 --> 14:46.480
That's pretty brutal.

14:46.480 --> 14:50.720
But an introvert like myself, if you were planning, if you're looking forward to intimate

14:50.720 --> 14:54.480
get together with friends, maybe a couple of board games, and then it turned into a

14:54.480 --> 14:54.880
party.

14:54.880 --> 14:55.840
Oh my God.

14:55.840 --> 14:57.040
I want to puke just thinking about it.

14:57.040 --> 14:59.360
I would just call the police on myself.

14:59.360 --> 15:01.840
Could someone please come down here and help me break this up?

15:01.840 --> 15:06.720
Can you throw everyone out of our house except for the six people who are going to play cards

15:06.720 --> 15:08.640
against humanity with me, please?

15:08.640 --> 15:10.800
I was just planning a quiet risk night.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.640
And now I'm so scared.

15:12.640 --> 15:14.080
You ruined my risk night.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.000
That has an allure when you're young.

15:16.960 --> 15:20.960
Because when I was at that party and realized like, Oh my God, this is an illegal party.

15:20.960 --> 15:21.840
I was so down.

15:21.840 --> 15:28.880
But I think at the tender age of 25, as I am now, I think if I went to somebody's house

15:28.880 --> 15:31.840
and there's a crazy party going on outside and it's like, Hey, man, is this your house?

15:31.840 --> 15:34.000
And they're like, Nah, man, I'm house sitting for my brother.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.080
I would just be like, Oh, thank you and leave.

15:36.080 --> 15:38.960
Because I don't want to be, I would be so uncomfortable at that party.

15:38.960 --> 15:41.760
This is, or you're breaking and entering basically.

15:41.760 --> 15:42.240
Yeah.

15:42.240 --> 15:47.600
You know, I think back to, I remember being in college and my roommate and best friend

15:47.600 --> 15:50.880
Brent and I would often like just try to find a party.

15:50.880 --> 15:55.360
And we went through a period, which was really weird, where we would just like try to find

15:55.360 --> 15:57.680
a friend of a friend of a friend, anything.

15:57.680 --> 16:01.120
So we weren't bored and meeting new people because we were hanging out with the exact

16:01.120 --> 16:02.160
same people every weekend.

16:02.160 --> 16:06.160
And now I think about that, and if I rolled up to a party and it was just crazy wild,

16:06.160 --> 16:11.280
even if it was like my friends throwing the party, how, how just against it all I would

16:11.280 --> 16:16.080
be like, Oh man, I just want to sit down, like drink a glass of red wine.

16:16.080 --> 16:20.160
You get to this point where you realize I actually, it actually happened to me in my

16:20.880 --> 16:26.320
fifth year of college and no comments from the peanut gallery, but my fifth year college,

16:26.320 --> 16:28.080
that's my, that's my old man voice.

16:28.080 --> 16:32.400
My fifth year college, I was talking to my college friends and we were like, where are

16:32.400 --> 16:32.960
the parties?

16:32.960 --> 16:37.600
And then we realized, we were like, we never hear about parties going on anymore.

16:37.600 --> 16:39.360
And then it's like, hold on a second.

16:39.360 --> 16:42.960
I don't think people, we actually thought for a few minutes, like, why doesn't anybody

16:42.960 --> 16:44.160
do parties anymore?

16:45.040 --> 16:47.120
Why does everybody stop throwing parties?

16:47.120 --> 16:48.720
Wait a minute.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.640
Nobody asked us to go to them.

16:52.960 --> 16:56.880
I work in an office where I spend most of my days sitting down and talking to people.

16:56.880 --> 16:59.200
Office where I spend most of my day sitting in a cubicle.

16:59.200 --> 17:03.360
My coworkers are older than me and they decorate their cubes, pictures of their spouses, kids

17:03.360 --> 17:04.160
and pets.

17:04.160 --> 17:08.080
Whenever they come into my cube, they always comment on how I haven't decorated it at all.

17:09.040 --> 17:10.160
Decorated it at all.

17:10.160 --> 17:11.360
Yeah, I got the right number.

17:11.360 --> 17:11.760
There we go.

17:12.400 --> 17:16.320
I am a single guy without any kids or pets and I need some decorating ideas that are

17:16.320 --> 17:19.760
personal enough to be interesting, but still appropriate for work.

17:19.760 --> 17:20.720
Any suggestions?

17:20.720 --> 17:23.840
That's from memento lists in Memphis.

17:23.840 --> 17:26.880
Oh, man.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.400
Now I'm bummed.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.720
Well, I mean, you could do toys.

17:30.720 --> 17:39.520
Like, I've got in my cubicle a Harry Houdini bobblehead, a Superman bust, and a donkey

17:39.520 --> 17:41.360
figurine from Shrek that talks.

17:42.480 --> 17:43.760
Go fuck yourself.

17:44.400 --> 17:44.960
What?

17:44.960 --> 17:45.440
Why?

17:45.440 --> 17:45.940
Griffin?

17:46.480 --> 17:47.920
No, Travis.

17:47.920 --> 17:48.880
You're an adult.

17:49.520 --> 17:50.160
I am an adult.

17:50.160 --> 17:51.920
I'm an adult that works at a theater.

17:51.920 --> 17:56.400
You're going to be somebody's husband soon and you have a Shrek toy on your desk where

17:56.400 --> 17:56.960
you work.

17:56.960 --> 17:57.040
He talks.

17:57.040 --> 17:59.680
He says, like, you know what else is better than parfaits?

17:59.680 --> 18:02.000
You know when someone says, you want parfaits?

18:02.000 --> 18:03.280
He says, hell no, I don't want parfaits.

18:03.280 --> 18:04.400
Parfaits are delicious.

18:04.400 --> 18:05.440
It's hilarious.

18:05.440 --> 18:07.280
That was word for word.

18:09.600 --> 18:14.400
You have used this toy so much that you have memorized that entire soliloquy.

18:14.400 --> 18:15.120
It's great.

18:15.120 --> 18:16.320
It's a good thing.

18:16.320 --> 18:18.320
And he also makes jokes about Shrek farting.

18:18.320 --> 18:21.920
He says, like, shoo, Shrek, did you just rip one off?

18:21.920 --> 18:24.240
I have my mouth open and everything.

18:24.240 --> 18:25.040
It's pretty great.

18:26.080 --> 18:26.720
I'm just saying.

18:26.720 --> 18:28.320
I hate you so much.

18:28.320 --> 18:29.360
It's just a pretty good thing.

18:29.360 --> 18:31.360
Justin spit coffee all over his keyboard.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.160
He had to go.

18:33.040 --> 18:33.680
Did he really?

18:34.640 --> 18:35.680
Yeah, he's cleaning it up.

18:38.880 --> 18:39.200
OK.

18:41.600 --> 18:42.400
Idiot.

18:42.400 --> 18:43.040
You're so dumb.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.400
You're a stupid Shrek doll.

18:44.400 --> 18:48.240
What about there's going to be something you like, right?

18:48.240 --> 18:49.120
About Doctor Who.

18:50.080 --> 18:52.000
There's a bunch of Doctor Who memorabilia.

18:53.280 --> 18:54.640
I also have a Dalek clock.

18:54.640 --> 18:56.800
That's what Sidney's got in her office, and it looks awesome.

18:56.800 --> 19:05.200
She's got a bunch of Doctor figures and adipose and whatever song.

19:05.200 --> 19:05.600
It's great.

19:06.240 --> 19:13.040
You guys are thinking about the fashion of the desk, what it's going to do for you.

19:13.040 --> 19:18.240
What you've got to think about when it comes to desk management is the function of it.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.160
What's it going to do for everybody?

19:22.560 --> 19:27.440
In my mind, I think you've either got to go full-blown minimalist,

19:28.640 --> 19:30.720
just your keyboard, mouse, and screen.

19:30.720 --> 19:32.320
That's it.

19:32.320 --> 19:33.440
And those are the only things you have.

19:33.440 --> 19:38.000
And if your cubicle isn't already stark white from floor to ceiling,

19:38.000 --> 19:39.280
then go ahead and paint that.

19:39.280 --> 19:45.200
And the opposite side of that is you clutter your desk with so much garbage

19:45.200 --> 19:48.640
that everybody thinks you are the busiest man in the whole world.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.080
Oh, yeah, right.

19:50.080 --> 19:53.040
You've got to look like an old-timey newspaper reporter.

19:53.600 --> 19:58.960
You've got to have stacks of papers, six half-empty coffee cups,

19:59.920 --> 20:06.160
which are sometimes called mugs, and pins scattered around,

20:06.160 --> 20:14.800
and two briefcases, a sandwich wrapper from the deli nearby,

20:16.960 --> 20:20.400
empty Skittles bags, because busy people eat Skittles.

20:20.400 --> 20:21.120
Right.

20:21.120 --> 20:24.320
There was a lady that I worked with at the newspaper,

20:24.320 --> 20:28.400
one of the newspapers I worked at, who had a jar of candy on her desk.

20:28.400 --> 20:33.920
And the deal was, if you came over and took some candy, you had to talk to her.

20:33.920 --> 20:36.400
And not like- Wait, wait, wait.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.440
Was that a stated deal?

20:38.240 --> 20:40.800
This was not like an unwritten social contract.

20:41.360 --> 20:44.640
This was a deal vocalized by her.

20:44.640 --> 20:45.120
Oh, no.

20:45.120 --> 20:48.320
Well, if you're taking some candy, gotta stay and chat.

20:48.320 --> 20:50.240
I'm so crushingly lonely.

20:50.240 --> 20:51.120
Please.

20:51.120 --> 20:54.160
There's a bear trap installed on a table,

20:54.160 --> 20:57.840
and if I see you try to pull your hand out of that jar with some sixlets,

20:57.840 --> 21:02.240
without chatting me up first, say goodbye to your paw.

21:02.240 --> 21:04.160
It's in the jar.

21:04.160 --> 21:05.280
How's your sugar daddy, huh?

21:05.280 --> 21:06.960
How's your thing about my sugar daddy?

21:07.840 --> 21:08.960
How's your family?

21:08.960 --> 21:10.160
That must be nice to have that.

21:12.160 --> 21:17.600
Basically, all I got are my wrestling tapes that I made in the 80s.

21:17.600 --> 21:18.800
I taped a bunch of wrestling.

21:18.800 --> 21:22.000
I watched those, and I do have a ferret.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.120
I had a ferret.

21:23.120 --> 21:24.080
He left.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.200
He ran away.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.320
He moved away.

21:26.320 --> 21:27.280
That's my life.

21:27.280 --> 21:28.320
I know, Deborah.

21:28.320 --> 21:32.240
It's the same thing you've been telling me for the past 17 weeks.

21:33.040 --> 21:34.480
Nothing has evolved.

21:34.480 --> 21:37.200
Well, time to go enjoy these sixlets.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.920
Thanks for the conversation.

21:39.920 --> 21:40.880
Totally worth it.

21:40.880 --> 21:43.200
I'm going to start going to the store.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.120
I'll buy my own candy.

21:47.120 --> 21:50.480
What about if you put up pictures of everyone else's family?

21:51.760 --> 21:56.880
That is a bad idea on 14 discrete levels.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.880
I can't see how this could possibly go wrong.

21:59.680 --> 22:02.480
Other people's family that you do work with or that you don't work with?

22:02.480 --> 22:03.280
That you do work with.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.280
Just ask if you could photocopy their pictures.

22:07.600 --> 22:08.960
Well, that's the ball game, folks.

22:10.640 --> 22:11.440
Oh, man.

22:11.440 --> 22:13.600
Just buy frames that already have pictures in them.

22:14.640 --> 22:16.400
This is me at my eight weddings.

22:16.400 --> 22:16.880
Right here?

22:16.880 --> 22:18.480
This is me graduating from high school.

22:19.040 --> 22:20.160
This is my son, Kevin.

22:20.160 --> 22:21.040
I love him very much.

22:22.240 --> 22:25.120
This is me and my whole family in raincoats.

22:25.120 --> 22:27.280
As you can see, we love sailing.

22:27.280 --> 22:28.160
We love to sail.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.280
This is my sailing ship.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.640
I have a picture of it.

22:33.200 --> 22:34.880
I built this model of my sailing ship.

22:35.600 --> 22:36.240
We take it out.

22:36.240 --> 22:37.120
We sail.

22:37.120 --> 22:37.680
We sail.

22:38.240 --> 22:39.520
Just a big sailing family.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.760
Can you just have empty frames?

22:44.560 --> 22:47.760
And then if somebody asks what happened, just say a terrible tragedy happened.

22:48.480 --> 22:49.440
Something terrible.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.280
Ghosts took the...

22:51.280 --> 22:54.320
Oh, somebody traveled back in time and erased my path.

22:54.320 --> 22:57.040
These used to have really great, beautiful pictures of my children in it.

22:57.920 --> 23:01.040
Someone traveled back in time and stopped me from meeting what was to be my wife.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.600
And it was my son, so fuck him.

23:03.600 --> 23:04.480
Fuck that kid.

23:04.480 --> 23:06.560
He's imaginary now.

23:06.560 --> 23:07.840
Yeah, he doesn't exist anymore.

23:07.840 --> 23:08.160
It's very, very...

23:08.160 --> 23:09.200
I'm starting a charity.

23:09.200 --> 23:12.080
If you'd like to donate $20, then you can also have some candy.

23:13.280 --> 23:15.520
Just put empty frames up and then have little post-its on them.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.920
Like one will say mother and one will say son.

23:18.560 --> 23:19.360
To do.

23:19.360 --> 23:20.240
Find a son.

23:20.240 --> 23:25.840
Find son.

23:25.840 --> 23:27.120
That would be great if somebody came by and were like,

23:27.120 --> 23:29.200
why are all these picture frames empty?

23:29.200 --> 23:31.360
Stand up and be like, like you just realized.

23:31.360 --> 23:33.440
Like, oh fuck, not again.

23:35.120 --> 23:37.280
Strap on the time belt and then disappear.

23:37.280 --> 23:38.240
You've got to disappear.

23:38.240 --> 23:39.360
That's going to be the hard part of this.

23:40.880 --> 23:42.720
You got to have a TARDIS right next door.

23:42.720 --> 23:43.120
Yeah.

23:43.120 --> 23:43.920
I'll be right back.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.880
Hey, do you have any creative ideas for fundraisers?

23:46.880 --> 23:50.160
I'm raising money to spend two years in Nicaragua.

23:50.800 --> 23:53.360
Volunteering and I'm a little short of my goal.

23:53.360 --> 23:53.840
Thanks.

23:54.560 --> 23:55.060
Evide.

23:56.480 --> 23:59.440
Can you kickstart a Nicaragua trip?

24:00.160 --> 24:01.280
You can kickstart pretty much.

24:01.280 --> 24:04.560
If I wanted to go to Hardee's, but I didn't want to pay like the four bucks for

24:05.520 --> 24:10.800
a sandwich of sausage and eggs, then I could kickstart that.

24:10.800 --> 24:14.160
Let's kickstart my brother, my brother and me Hardee's party.

24:14.160 --> 24:17.360
And it's basically like however much money we get, that's how many people.

24:17.360 --> 24:17.520
Okay.

24:17.520 --> 24:20.560
To start, we need $500,000 to build a Hardee's.

24:20.560 --> 24:20.880
What?

24:20.880 --> 24:22.800
There's a Hardee's in Route 60.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.000
You guys have Hardee's here?

24:24.000 --> 24:24.640
Go get it.

24:24.640 --> 24:28.960
We'll need at least, I think we're in pretty good with Andrew WK.

24:28.960 --> 24:32.720
So he'll probably cut us a pretty sweet deal to record a version of a song.

24:32.720 --> 24:34.960
When it's time to party, we will party hard ease.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.080
Breakfast fundraising experience.

24:40.080 --> 24:44.960
When it's time to party, we will party hard ease.

24:44.960 --> 24:46.480
What are the California raisins doing?

24:46.480 --> 24:47.680
Will they come back?

24:47.680 --> 24:51.360
I will put on a garbage bag and dress like a California raisin for you.

24:51.920 --> 24:53.600
This is going to be a really good party.

24:53.600 --> 24:54.640
I'm really excited about this.

24:54.640 --> 24:56.720
You guys, this is going to be like a super bad party.

24:57.280 --> 24:58.160
You're welcome.

24:58.160 --> 24:59.520
I went to my super bad party.

24:59.520 --> 25:01.120
It was at a Hardee's on Route 60.

25:01.920 --> 25:02.960
They had a little slide.

25:03.680 --> 25:04.480
It was awesome.

25:04.480 --> 25:05.840
It was a little arty farty.

25:05.840 --> 25:10.160
What are we doing?

25:10.160 --> 25:10.720
It's Hardee's.

25:10.720 --> 25:13.360
It's no Sardee's, but it was a Hardee's party.

25:14.720 --> 25:16.080
Just don't be, don't be tardy.

25:16.080 --> 25:18.080
Oh, for Christ's sake, move on.

25:18.080 --> 25:20.000
Get a ride with my friend Marty to the Hardee's party.

25:20.000 --> 25:20.320
Next.

25:20.320 --> 25:22.160
My friend Marty erased all my pictures.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.200
Creative ideas for fundraisers.

25:30.400 --> 25:34.240
I think if I saw a grown woman selling lemonade, that would be pretty crazy.

25:34.240 --> 25:38.560
I think I would probably donate to her because I'd assume she had fallen on hard times.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.320
Especially if some of the letters were backwards.

25:42.320 --> 25:43.680
If she put like womenade.

25:45.680 --> 25:48.880
Wait, not women, not women.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.760
I actually think you could be arrested for selling womenade on the street.

25:57.040 --> 25:59.120
Excuse me, you got a permit for this womenade?

26:00.800 --> 26:02.400
You sound adorable, officer.

26:02.400 --> 26:07.600
No, I mean, is lemonade, is lemonade, is womenade, lemonade sold by women?

26:07.600 --> 26:08.480
What is it?

26:08.480 --> 26:11.360
I thought it was lemonade sold for women.

26:11.360 --> 26:12.240
Like made of them.

26:14.960 --> 26:18.320
Like you put a spigot in the side of a woman and womenade comes out.

26:20.000 --> 26:20.560
It's adorable.

26:20.560 --> 26:23.280
It's 100% pure, fresh lemonade.

26:23.280 --> 26:29.120
This is like, I feel like a new energy beverage, a new vitamin water is invented every week

26:29.120 --> 26:32.880
and womenade is our fucking meal ticket.

26:32.880 --> 26:33.380
I know.

26:35.680 --> 26:36.400
Here's what it's got.

26:36.400 --> 26:38.320
It's got a natural balance of electrolytes.

26:38.320 --> 26:40.320
It's going to help you rehydrate.

26:40.320 --> 26:44.000
It's also got estrogen because that's something that's in ladies.

26:44.000 --> 26:44.560
Here's what you do.

26:44.560 --> 26:50.640
You can also B12 and whatever is in red wine that makes you not get Alzheimer's.

26:53.440 --> 26:57.920
You take a regular country time lemonade, you cut it with water because vitamin drinks

26:57.920 --> 27:04.720
can't taste as good as normal drinks and then you throw a one a day women's supplement in there.

27:04.720 --> 27:05.920
That's okay.

27:05.920 --> 27:07.680
And then just a dash of red wine.

27:07.680 --> 27:09.120
Hey guys, let me throw this out.

27:09.120 --> 27:09.920
Let me eat you with this.

27:09.920 --> 27:10.420
Okay.

27:10.420 --> 27:10.720
Okay.

27:10.720 --> 27:12.720
The spokesperson, Ray Liotta.

27:12.720 --> 27:14.080
Ray Liotta for womenade.

27:14.080 --> 27:15.120
I think we should get a woman.

27:15.120 --> 27:17.440
That's a brave choice.

27:17.440 --> 27:19.600
That seems pretty cut and dry.

27:19.600 --> 27:20.560
I don't like it.

27:20.560 --> 27:21.200
Too obvious.

27:21.200 --> 27:29.040
Too obvious. You know what women these days are so concerned about is osteoporosis.

27:29.040 --> 27:31.520
So womenade does have ground up bones in it.

27:31.520 --> 27:32.080
Yeah.

27:32.080 --> 27:33.360
So you can get your calcium.

27:33.360 --> 27:33.920
It is.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.600
It's the chunks that let you know it's working.

27:35.600 --> 27:37.120
It does make it a little mealy.

27:37.120 --> 27:39.120
It makes it sort of sludge like.

27:39.120 --> 27:42.000
Hey guys, what would you think of this as like a mascot?

27:42.880 --> 27:45.280
The little animated baby from Ally McBeal.

27:47.200 --> 27:47.920
I love it.

27:47.920 --> 27:53.440
Your biological clock's ticking and it's counting down to womenade time.

27:53.440 --> 27:59.600
Crack open a fresh womenade with the baby from Ally McBeal and Ray Liotta, our spokespeople.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.080
Get out of here, baby.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.440
You're creeping me out.

28:03.440 --> 28:04.960
This is Ray Liotta's voice.

28:06.400 --> 28:09.600
They promised him that they were going to CGI the baby in later, but they never did.

28:11.360 --> 28:14.160
Did you see that fucking womenade commercial?

28:14.160 --> 28:15.600
Ray Liotta is losing it.

28:15.600 --> 28:18.640
I'm losing my mind over this.

28:18.640 --> 28:20.480
Look at him with his little diaper.

28:21.840 --> 28:22.880
Doing that little dance.

28:22.880 --> 28:24.480
What do you call that, baby?

28:24.480 --> 28:26.800
It's just, hey baby, get back here.

28:26.800 --> 28:28.480
Hey, hold this drink for a second, baby.

28:28.480 --> 28:29.520
I got a womenade.

28:29.520 --> 28:30.640
I gotta pitch womenade.

28:31.520 --> 28:32.800
Gotta sell the people on it.

28:33.680 --> 28:34.960
Ooga chaka.

28:34.960 --> 28:35.840
Right, baby?

28:35.840 --> 28:36.480
You like that?

28:36.480 --> 28:37.120
Ooga chaka, right baby?

28:37.120 --> 28:37.840
Remember that?

28:37.840 --> 28:39.520
Remember when you and Pyrrha McNichol?

28:39.520 --> 28:40.960
Man, I love that show.

28:40.960 --> 28:48.400
This, I feel like womenade idea is going to make us a lot of money, but in the meantime,

28:49.520 --> 28:52.480
we could make money by going to the money zone.

29:06.480 --> 29:07.680
Hey, building a website?

29:08.560 --> 29:09.120
Dummy?

29:09.120 --> 29:10.240
Can't do it on yourself?

29:10.240 --> 29:10.880
I don't blame you.

29:10.880 --> 29:13.040
I don't know how to build them either, but here's what you need to do.

29:13.040 --> 29:15.040
You need to get the all new Squarespace 6.

29:15.600 --> 29:17.040
It's got beautiful new templates.

29:17.920 --> 29:18.400
Dummy.

29:18.400 --> 29:20.080
It's got drag and drop interface.

29:20.080 --> 29:23.120
It's got responsive design, social media connectivity.

29:23.120 --> 29:24.320
You don't know what that means?

29:24.320 --> 29:25.120
Tough noogies.

29:25.120 --> 29:27.280
Squarespace is going to walk you through it all.

29:27.280 --> 29:30.560

29:43.600 --> 29:48.080

29:48.080 --> 29:50.480
Go to squarespace.com and get out of my hair.

29:50.480 --> 29:51.760
God, Jesus, guys.

29:52.800 --> 29:53.200
I know.

29:54.240 --> 29:57.840
If our listeners have had a hard day, you think that's going to make it any easier?

29:58.720 --> 30:00.960
Now they can build a website to cry about it.

30:00.960 --> 30:01.360
Okay.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.440
There'll be JavaScript.

30:03.440 --> 30:06.720
Click a button to make me cry.

30:08.720 --> 30:10.000
I'm an internet baby.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.520
I'm an internet baby.

30:11.520 --> 30:12.640
My feelings are hurt.

30:12.640 --> 30:15.520
Ray Liotta, can you see me dancing around?

30:15.520 --> 30:17.120
Oh, cuddle me, Ray Liotta.

30:17.120 --> 30:18.880
Cuddle me, Ray Liotta.

30:18.880 --> 30:20.400
You nurture me, Ray Liotta.

30:20.400 --> 30:22.960
I'm an internet baby from Alley McBeal for women.

30:22.960 --> 30:25.440
Make all my problems go away, Ray.

30:25.440 --> 30:28.800
Scoop me up in your arms and rub my soft cheek on your bristle.

30:28.800 --> 30:32.000
Protect me from everything that could possibly happen to me, Ray Liotta.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.520
Your breath smells like chewed up cigarettes and old whiskey.

30:35.520 --> 30:36.960
I love you, Ray Liotta.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.160
I'm an internet baby.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.800
The mackerel has hurt my feelings.

30:40.800 --> 30:41.840
Well, well, well.

30:41.840 --> 30:45.040
Wrap me up in your old leather coat and drive me-

30:45.040 --> 30:47.600
We'll watch Wild Hogs together, Ray Liotta.

30:47.600 --> 30:49.840
You can tell me what it was like working with Tim Allen.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.360
I won't understand the big words.

30:52.160 --> 30:53.600
You have to slow down.

30:54.240 --> 30:55.360
Because I'm a baby.

30:55.360 --> 30:57.280
Because I'm an internet baby, Ray.

30:57.840 --> 30:59.040
I love you.

30:59.040 --> 31:01.920
You're my new dad.

31:01.920 --> 31:02.720
Oh, God.

31:02.720 --> 31:05.120
Travis, your pile of media you don't like anymore

31:05.120 --> 31:07.600
has become a threat to me and others that you love.

31:07.600 --> 31:08.480
They're my babies.

31:08.480 --> 31:09.440
Leave me alone.

31:09.440 --> 31:10.800
Will you sell your babies?

31:10.800 --> 31:11.520
Yes.

31:11.520 --> 31:13.680
You go to a bunda trade for five years.

31:13.680 --> 31:16.000
They've been perfecting the media trade in biz.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.640
They take 25% more things than anybody else.

31:18.640 --> 31:23.440
And they're going to give you 10% more for your CDs, DVDs, video games,

31:23.440 --> 31:27.200
and gadgets like iPhones, iPods, and Androids.

31:27.200 --> 31:28.880
So I don't know why you get rid of an Android.

31:28.880 --> 31:29.840
Trade-in data.

31:29.840 --> 31:30.880
Trade-in data.

31:30.880 --> 31:31.760
Get some money.

31:31.760 --> 31:34.960
On trade-ins valued $25 or greater, you're going to get free shipping.

31:34.960 --> 31:39.680
And our listeners can get an extra 10% on their trade-ins.

31:39.680 --> 31:42.720
So that's even more money for you.

31:42.720 --> 31:48.880
Go to a bunda trade, A-B-U-N-D-A-T-R-A-D-E.com forward slash my brother.php.

31:48.880 --> 31:52.320
And you're going to get that extra 10% on your babies

31:52.320 --> 31:54.320
that you used to love and now are money.

31:56.080 --> 31:56.800
You want a Yahoo?

31:57.440 --> 31:57.920
Yes.

31:57.920 --> 31:59.600
I do. I was going to ask for that.

31:59.600 --> 32:01.280
This Yahoo was sent in by Lisa Holifield.

32:01.280 --> 32:01.840
Thank you, Lisa.

32:01.840 --> 32:09.760
It's by Yahoo Answers user MarleyCanFly with two Ys, who asks,

32:12.160 --> 32:14.320
how can I make a homemade engagement ring?

32:16.160 --> 32:18.240
I am ready to propose to my girlfriend of over a year,

32:18.240 --> 32:20.880
but we're in college, so you can imagine that money is tight.

32:20.880 --> 32:24.160
I want to make a ring by Thursday night, which is when I am proposing.

32:24.160 --> 32:26.880
It doesn't have to be super fancy, as I know eventually

32:26.880 --> 32:28.560
I will buy her something nice.

32:28.560 --> 32:30.720
I just need something to show I care and love her.

32:30.720 --> 32:32.320
Please help, smiley face.

32:32.320 --> 32:34.640
Hey, bro, you're doing this all wrong.

32:35.600 --> 32:38.720
Now, we haven't dealt with this on the show,

32:38.720 --> 32:44.000
but one of us just recently went through the very similar process.

32:44.560 --> 32:46.720
Yes, I got engaged a couple weeks ago.

32:47.360 --> 32:50.160
And let me tell you, here's the thing, bro.

32:50.160 --> 32:53.840
It's real easy to say like, hey, I made you this ring out of a coat hanger

32:53.840 --> 32:54.400
and I love you.

32:54.400 --> 32:55.760
Will you marry me forever?

32:55.760 --> 33:00.880
The point is that you cared enough about it to save up and get this beautiful ring.

33:00.880 --> 33:02.000
It's not so much that.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.440
You cared enough to make a ring.

33:04.080 --> 33:08.720
Yeah, I think it's more of a, hey, I am a good partner to share your life with

33:08.720 --> 33:11.680
because I have enough financial stability to purchase this.

33:11.680 --> 33:15.920
It's that, and also to say, I've been thinking about this for long enough

33:15.920 --> 33:17.440
to save the money.

33:17.440 --> 33:21.040
I'm truly committed to this idea and not like, hey,

33:21.040 --> 33:24.720
you made me a really nice dinner Monday night, so now I'm totally sold on it.

33:24.720 --> 33:25.920
Let's do this.

33:25.920 --> 33:28.240
I mean, are we talking pipe cleaners?

33:28.240 --> 33:30.320
That seems like the number one thing.

33:30.320 --> 33:32.080
Get yourself some popsicle sticks.

33:32.080 --> 33:35.360
Popsicle sticks, preferably not the ones with jokes on them.

33:35.360 --> 33:36.960
After all, this is a formal event.

33:37.920 --> 33:44.320
And just wrap up a pipe cleaner around like a marshmallow for a gem.

33:44.320 --> 33:45.440
I think that would be beautiful.

33:45.440 --> 33:46.160
No, that's good.

33:46.160 --> 33:49.360
What about, can I propose just a, no pun intended.

33:49.360 --> 33:53.600
Just like a, how about a ring pop, but you gotta suck it down for a bit

33:53.600 --> 33:55.440
or else it's just going to be ostentatious.

33:55.440 --> 33:56.800
It's going to be gaudy, too gaudy.

33:56.800 --> 33:58.080
She's not Zsa Zsa Gabor.

33:58.080 --> 33:59.280
Yeah, exactly.

33:59.280 --> 34:01.760
And if they do make like a, I don't know, like a,

34:01.760 --> 34:07.360
do they make like a plain crystal, like rock candy, like a meth-flavored ring pop?

34:07.360 --> 34:10.640
They do, they make a flavorless, colorless ring pop.

34:11.280 --> 34:15.360
But there's tons of flaws in it, so it's not rated very highly.

34:15.360 --> 34:16.560
That's why you gotta suck it down.

34:16.560 --> 34:18.240
You gotta whittle it, you know?

34:19.120 --> 34:20.720
You know how people whittle diamonds?

34:21.840 --> 34:22.080
Right.

34:22.080 --> 34:23.280
Right, here's the thing.

34:23.280 --> 34:25.200
Old timey guys sit on a porch.

34:25.200 --> 34:26.880
And they whittle down their diamonds with their diamond knives.

34:26.880 --> 34:29.760
They get their laser knife out and they just carve it right down.

34:29.760 --> 34:30.720
Oh, lost my thumb.

34:32.480 --> 34:33.600
And also my kneecaps.

34:33.600 --> 34:34.560
And also my kneecaps.

34:34.560 --> 34:35.840
I hate this laser.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.280
Why did I start this?

34:37.280 --> 34:38.720
God, I hate my empty life.

34:40.160 --> 34:46.160
Have you ever watched The Real Housewives of any statehood?

34:46.160 --> 34:47.360
No, never, never.

34:48.480 --> 34:50.320
In fact, I've actively not watched it.

34:50.320 --> 34:56.320
I haven't, let me go ahead and set up this thing I'm about to say by saying I have not either.

34:56.320 --> 35:00.640
But I bet you if you got one of them, like a ring that you had,

35:01.280 --> 35:05.280
like a ring-shaped piece of construction paper that you had cut out and said,

35:05.280 --> 35:06.480
will you marry me?

35:06.480 --> 35:10.000
They would throw you off the premises of wherever it is that they live.

35:10.000 --> 35:14.400
Okay, but what we haven't taken into consideration is maybe this guy is a blacksmith.

35:14.960 --> 35:15.520
Right.

35:15.520 --> 35:17.680
That he's actually smelting a ring.

35:17.680 --> 35:20.800
Okay, maybe he owns like a blood diamond mine.

35:20.800 --> 35:21.360
Sure, right.

35:22.080 --> 35:26.720
I do like that in his question, he specifies that it doesn't need to be fancy,

35:26.720 --> 35:29.440
as though by Thursday, he's going to learn metallurgy.

35:31.120 --> 35:32.320
I don't need anything.

35:32.320 --> 35:34.000
It doesn't need to look store-bought.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.600
Yeah, no kidding.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.120
I mean, it'll be electroplated.

35:37.120 --> 35:40.800
But other than that, I only have access to cubic zirconia.

35:40.800 --> 35:47.120
So now if you like learned how to make rings and you actually like put the work into that,

35:47.120 --> 35:48.800
like took a class or something, you know,

35:48.800 --> 35:55.520
you went to the museum and you took a class on ring-making, ring-a-street.

35:55.520 --> 35:58.080
You took a class on ring-a-street and then you made the ring.

35:58.080 --> 36:02.640
That's special because it wasn't something you wanted to do by Thursday.

36:02.640 --> 36:03.200
Yeah.

36:03.200 --> 36:03.440
Yeah.

36:04.080 --> 36:08.480
Well, and you know, I'll say this, having just done it, after I did it,

36:08.480 --> 36:13.440
after I actually like bought, you know, a nice, somewhat for me, expensive ring,

36:13.440 --> 36:14.960
I felt really adult.

36:14.960 --> 36:19.040
I feel like I'd really earned it and deserve to propose to my girlfriend, you know?

36:19.680 --> 36:23.440
Because I was an adult now and I could pay for a ring than an adult would get.

36:24.800 --> 36:25.280
What was that?

36:25.280 --> 36:25.840
So there.

36:25.840 --> 36:26.640
The losers.

36:26.640 --> 36:27.120
What was that?

36:27.120 --> 36:30.000
I've been googling furiously for like two and a half minutes.

36:30.000 --> 36:30.960
What was that toy?

36:32.640 --> 36:36.560
And it was like a, it's like an Easy-Bake oven, but...

36:36.560 --> 36:37.440
Metal maker.

36:37.440 --> 36:38.080
Metal maker?

36:39.200 --> 36:40.000
Yeah, I believe so.

36:40.560 --> 36:41.280
Was that really?

36:41.280 --> 36:42.480
I don't think you made rings.

36:42.480 --> 36:45.280
I think you just made tiny dragon and wizard figurines.

36:45.280 --> 36:48.160
You could have proposed to your girlfriend with that.

36:48.160 --> 36:50.800
It was like an Easy-Bake oven, except you put little pewter balls in it

36:50.800 --> 36:53.120
and it would melt the pewter balls down into whatever shape.

36:53.120 --> 36:54.320
No, a metal molder.

36:54.320 --> 36:54.880
That was it.

36:54.880 --> 36:55.760
Metal molder.

36:57.600 --> 36:58.000
I don't know.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.040
I think you could probably...

36:59.920 --> 37:01.200
Yes, it was metal molder.

37:01.200 --> 37:03.520
You could make something like that work, I feel like.

37:03.520 --> 37:05.520
I feel like they probably made a ring-shaped thing

37:05.520 --> 37:08.240
and then maybe if you get fancy, you could stick a wizard on it.

37:09.200 --> 37:09.760
Yeah.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.840
And then you put little rhinestones in the wizard's eyes.

37:11.840 --> 37:12.800
Stick a wizard on it.

37:12.800 --> 37:16.560
You stick a wizard on it and you put the gemstones in his eyes and then...

37:16.560 --> 37:18.080
Just fill him with the gemstones.

37:18.080 --> 37:20.720
And then the person knows how much you love them.

37:21.360 --> 37:26.080
Oh, honey, you sought out a 1995 metal molder and you made me a wizard ring.

37:26.960 --> 37:29.520
How did we think that was a good idea for our kids?

37:29.520 --> 37:31.040
How did we not think that there was just gonna be...

37:31.040 --> 37:32.560
I made a thousand wizards.

37:32.560 --> 37:34.720
And you were the only child in the whole country

37:34.720 --> 37:37.360
who didn't fucking Johnny Tremaine themselves right away.

37:37.920 --> 37:39.600
Fuck, you beat me to Johnny Tremaine.

37:39.600 --> 37:41.280
I mean, damn it.

37:42.880 --> 37:45.680
You opened that door just so you could say Johnny Tremaine, right?

37:45.680 --> 37:48.080
Sometimes I do that for myself.

37:48.080 --> 37:49.360
Hey, kids, read a fucking book.

37:49.360 --> 37:51.040
Johnny Tremaine is a book.

37:51.040 --> 37:52.000
Idiots.

37:52.000 --> 37:52.400
Idiots.

37:52.400 --> 37:52.880
Read it.

37:52.880 --> 37:53.920
Just read it.

37:53.920 --> 37:56.240
I swear to God, last week our listeners were smart.

37:56.800 --> 37:57.920
I don't know what happened.

37:57.920 --> 37:58.320
It's like...

37:58.320 --> 37:59.120
I don't know what happened.

37:59.120 --> 38:01.440
They listen to our show too much in other tones.

38:01.440 --> 38:02.240
I guess.

38:02.240 --> 38:04.400
Hey, brothers, I have a pressing issue.

38:04.400 --> 38:07.120
My best friend started dating a girl last year.

38:07.120 --> 38:09.040
She seems to make him happy and that's great.

38:09.040 --> 38:09.920
Here's the problem.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.760
I really dislike her.

38:11.760 --> 38:15.200
It's not that she's bitchy or mean to me most of the time.

38:15.200 --> 38:17.040
It's just that I don't like her personality.

38:17.040 --> 38:20.160
They often ask me to hang out with him and a few other friends of ours.

38:20.160 --> 38:21.440
My question is this.

38:21.440 --> 38:24.720
Should I not hang out with him and so not see my best friend?

38:24.720 --> 38:28.400
Or should I still hang out with him and just grin and bear her company?

38:28.400 --> 38:30.000
Please, brothers, I need advice.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.600
That's from reverse Jesse's girl.

38:34.160 --> 38:36.880
You know, I'm starting to learn and I'm coming to accept this

38:36.880 --> 38:43.680
that as an adult that exists in society, I don't get to play that game anymore.

38:43.680 --> 38:47.280
I used to think I don't like this person so it's completely within my rights

38:47.280 --> 38:49.040
to make it obvious to them that I don't like them

38:49.040 --> 38:51.040
and I never have to talk to them and I never have to see them.

38:51.920 --> 38:54.560
And then, you know, you have friends that start dating people

38:54.560 --> 38:59.040
and you get jobs and you have kids that start dating people

38:59.040 --> 39:03.600
and all this stuff gets added into your life that you can't control anymore

39:03.600 --> 39:06.000
and you gotta learn the skill of grinning and bearing it.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.120
Yeah, it's a great trick.

39:08.160 --> 39:11.680
Washing your hands with somebody is a great trick that you can do like five times

39:11.680 --> 39:13.760
and then you wake up you're like, I'm alone.

39:13.760 --> 39:16.400
And it really only works till somebody else says,

39:16.400 --> 39:18.640
hey, what's your problem with that person?

39:18.640 --> 39:22.320
And suddenly the scrutiny makes it no longer an available option.

39:22.320 --> 39:26.240
If you ever watched Lost, you'll know that if you spend enough time

39:26.240 --> 39:28.800
with somebody that you at first really hate,

39:28.800 --> 39:32.400
you may get to really like them and perhaps even fall in love with them.

39:32.400 --> 39:33.600
Or Jack and Sawyer.

39:33.600 --> 39:36.160
Or possibly they're an evil ghost.

39:37.680 --> 39:38.000
Okay.

39:38.720 --> 39:40.880
But if she's an evil ghost, don't you want to unearth that

39:40.880 --> 39:42.400
and save your friend the indignity?

39:43.680 --> 39:47.280
The embarrassment of having dated an evil ghost?

39:48.240 --> 39:49.760
That's what no one ever tells you in that story

39:49.760 --> 39:52.000
where like the guy picks up the hitchhiking girl

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
and then as he passes her grave, she disappears

39:54.000 --> 39:55.520
and then he just feels so embarrassed.

39:55.520 --> 39:56.400
Oh boy.

39:57.600 --> 39:58.880
I am such a dumbo.

39:58.880 --> 39:59.680
Not again.

39:59.680 --> 40:00.880
Get it together, Chuck.

40:00.880 --> 40:02.720
I was already planning Christmas dinner.

40:02.720 --> 40:03.520
Damn it.

40:03.520 --> 40:04.960
How many times is this, Chuck?

40:07.520 --> 40:08.000
Idiot.

40:08.880 --> 40:10.640
This is just what mother warned you about.

40:13.840 --> 40:17.680
Yeah, this isn't your tough, tough tea.

40:17.680 --> 40:18.880
Yeah, you got to deal with it.

40:18.880 --> 40:22.880
If you ever send us an email and the question is, he's very happy,

40:22.880 --> 40:29.920
but like just erase the email and then go play Nintendo or something.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.040
Go do something else.

40:31.760 --> 40:38.000
It's like, if you really care about this dude, that's what you want.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.200
Like that's the goal.

40:39.920 --> 40:41.040
You want him to be happy.

40:41.040 --> 40:42.320
If he's happy, great.

40:42.320 --> 40:43.360
Unless the end of the sentence is,

40:43.360 --> 40:46.640
but I don't think he should be doing as much heroin as he's doing.

40:47.200 --> 40:47.520
Right.

40:48.080 --> 40:49.120
But then you can step in.

40:49.120 --> 40:50.640
But she does supply him with HM's.

40:50.640 --> 40:51.120
Yeah.

40:51.120 --> 40:57.200
Unless this woman is like shooting sweet, sweet H into his arm every night

40:57.200 --> 40:58.480
as she sings him to sleep.

40:58.480 --> 41:06.640
She has bullied him emotionally into forming a radical to semi-radical hate group,

41:06.640 --> 41:08.880
but he seems to be enjoying himself.

41:10.160 --> 41:14.160
That is a condition under which, but like, I mean, seriously, who knows?

41:14.160 --> 41:15.360
Maybe you'll get to like her.

41:15.360 --> 41:16.240
Maybe you won't.

41:16.240 --> 41:19.840
Newsflash about growing up, you're not going to like most people.

41:20.960 --> 41:23.280
There's 6 billion people on earth.

41:23.280 --> 41:25.040
I know like 20 of them.

41:25.040 --> 41:29.360
I know like 20 of them and here's the thing is you're not saying,

41:29.360 --> 41:31.600
I started dating this girl and I don't like her.

41:31.600 --> 41:33.040
You're not involved in this.

41:33.040 --> 41:34.480
You don't need to make this decision.

41:34.480 --> 41:35.760
You just gotta hang in there.

41:35.760 --> 41:40.400
And maybe, and like, even if you don't like, if she's hurting him, that's one thing.

41:40.400 --> 41:43.680
But if, if it's just that you don't dig her personality, like.

41:44.800 --> 41:45.840
Suck it up.

41:45.840 --> 41:46.320
Tough.

41:46.880 --> 41:50.960
I love you because you listen to our show and maybe you're a donor to Max Fun,

41:50.960 --> 41:52.320
in which case you're right.

41:52.960 --> 41:53.280
God.

41:53.280 --> 41:54.480
Ugh.

41:54.480 --> 41:56.240
That is the service we provide.

41:56.240 --> 41:59.040
We can tell you that the bad life decisions that you're making.

41:59.040 --> 42:02.720
For only $20 a month, we can totally reinforce your behavior.

42:02.720 --> 42:03.040
Yeah.

42:03.040 --> 42:03.280
Right.

42:04.080 --> 42:08.000
But no, it's, it's, it's, I mean, you, you might get, grow to like her.

42:08.000 --> 42:11.200
You might see, if you like this guy and he sees something in her,

42:11.200 --> 42:14.000
maybe, and maybe she doesn't like you.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.760
I mean, that's why she's acting the way she's acting.

42:15.760 --> 42:19.360
And here's some other practical advice that I just know from studying acting.

42:19.360 --> 42:22.880
If you fake it enough, you will eventually grow to like her.

42:22.880 --> 42:24.960
If you grin and bear it enough, if you hang out with them

42:24.960 --> 42:28.400
and you pretend to have a good time and try to convince yourself that she's great,

42:28.400 --> 42:30.880
eventually you'll at least grow to tolerate her,

42:30.880 --> 42:33.440
which is better than what it sounds like you're at now.

42:33.440 --> 42:37.280
And note to those listening at home, especially the young ones,

42:37.280 --> 42:40.400
if someone says to you, here's something I learned from acting,

42:40.400 --> 42:42.080
usually you don't want to do the next thing.

42:42.080 --> 42:42.240
Yeah.

42:43.040 --> 42:44.800
No, but what I said was good.

42:44.800 --> 42:50.160
What's fun is you can actually usually do the opposite to great benefit to your life and health.

42:50.160 --> 42:52.720
Here's something I learned on the floorboards on the stage.

42:52.720 --> 42:56.080
When I was trotting the boards, as we say in the limelight,

42:58.400 --> 43:00.000
as I was practicing the bard.

43:00.720 --> 43:03.360
You just find the nearest sharp thing, put it in them somewhere.

43:04.720 --> 43:06.560
I need a place to store this.

43:06.560 --> 43:07.520
Hey, hold this.

43:07.520 --> 43:08.400
In your tummy.

43:08.400 --> 43:08.800
Thanks.

43:10.880 --> 43:11.200
Christ.

43:12.320 --> 43:12.640
Cool.

43:13.280 --> 43:14.720
Hey, you want another question?

43:14.720 --> 43:14.960
Yes.

43:14.960 --> 43:15.520
Another real one?

43:16.080 --> 43:19.840
I've recently started my first office job and I've noticed something unusual.

43:19.840 --> 43:23.280
I attend several meetings each week and frequently hear my co-workers use

43:23.280 --> 43:24.880
expression I've never heard before.

43:24.880 --> 43:28.800
For example, I'm not here to cut down the bush and throw it in the fire.

43:30.080 --> 43:33.120
I'm not here to put the elephant on the table and attack it.

43:33.120 --> 43:33.600
What?

43:34.160 --> 43:38.720
We're up to our eyeballs and alligators and there's a little hair on that.

43:41.120 --> 43:43.760
I'm going to go over these again because they're fantastic.

43:43.760 --> 43:46.400
I'm not here to cut down the bush and throw it in the fire.

43:46.400 --> 43:47.520
Not a real thing.

43:47.520 --> 43:48.480
Not a thing.

43:48.480 --> 43:51.040
I'm not going to put the elephant on the table and attack it.

43:51.040 --> 43:52.880
Physically, physically improbable.

43:52.880 --> 43:54.320
Do you work at a zoo?

43:54.320 --> 43:56.320
If so, that totally works.

43:56.320 --> 44:02.800
Up to our eyeballs and alligators and there's a little hair on that.

44:03.520 --> 44:05.840
I understand these in context where they seem weird to me.

44:05.840 --> 44:08.720
I also find that others pick up on them and start using them too.

44:08.720 --> 44:09.600
Am I missing something?

44:09.600 --> 44:11.040
And these are common expressions.

44:11.040 --> 44:16.320
Any ideas about a new weird expression I could try introducing into the workplace.

44:16.320 --> 44:18.160
That's from Oblivious in Ontario.

44:18.160 --> 44:18.640
Okay.

44:18.640 --> 44:22.400
There are two equally awesome situations you've stumbled onto here.

44:22.400 --> 44:26.400
One, you work at the coolest place ever and people are just coming up with this stuff.

44:26.400 --> 44:29.440
Two, you work at the coolest place ever and people are fucking with you.

44:30.080 --> 44:33.040
Before each meeting they say, no, which one are we going to use today?

44:33.040 --> 44:34.240
Oh, there's a little hair on that?

44:34.240 --> 44:34.960
Let's do it.

44:34.960 --> 44:37.920
Is it possible that this is just someone sending back their lunch order?

44:39.760 --> 44:40.960
There's a little hair on this.

44:40.960 --> 44:42.640
I can't, is that a new phrase?

44:43.360 --> 44:47.760
Listen, I hate to be a bother and I really don't want to put the elephant

44:47.760 --> 44:50.720
on the table and attack it, but you forgot the Swiss.

44:52.320 --> 44:52.880
Pardon me.

44:53.840 --> 44:58.560
Listen, I ordered the crocodile and then we are up to our eyeballs in alligators.

44:59.920 --> 45:01.840
Does this person work in the outback?

45:04.000 --> 45:07.280
They sound outbacky to me and that might just be like racism.

45:08.640 --> 45:11.360
Are you saying the restaurant, outback, steakhouse?

45:11.360 --> 45:17.440
No, I mean the outback of the great country continent, which is Australia.

45:17.440 --> 45:18.080
Australia.

45:18.720 --> 45:19.280
You know what?

45:19.280 --> 45:22.240
That country continent stuff, you know that there's other countries in that continent?

45:22.240 --> 45:23.040
Oh, come on.

45:23.760 --> 45:24.160
I know.

45:24.880 --> 45:26.000
I didn't know.

45:26.000 --> 45:26.800
I found out.

45:26.800 --> 45:27.200
There are.

45:27.760 --> 45:30.160
Sure, just like there's other countries in North America.

45:30.720 --> 45:31.760
Papua New Guinea?

45:31.760 --> 45:32.720
That's in Australia.

45:32.720 --> 45:33.200
Yeah.

45:33.200 --> 45:33.700
What?

45:34.400 --> 45:35.200
Did you know this?

45:35.200 --> 45:35.920
I didn't know that.

45:35.920 --> 45:37.120
Everyone knew it.

45:37.120 --> 45:37.520
Everyone knew it.

45:37.520 --> 45:38.400
Is Fiji in there?

45:38.400 --> 45:39.440
I tricked you, everyone knew it.

45:41.600 --> 45:42.560
I think that you...

45:43.440 --> 45:45.200
We should be able to help this person.

45:45.200 --> 45:47.440
You could say, let's dump this melon.

45:47.440 --> 45:48.320
Let's dump this melon.

45:48.320 --> 45:49.120
We say that.

45:49.120 --> 45:50.160
Just steal stuff from us.

45:51.280 --> 45:53.760
We say a bunch of dumb stuff that we forget about.

45:53.760 --> 45:54.720
We say a bunch of fun...

45:55.360 --> 45:58.080
We say a bunch of shit that's not real shit.

45:58.640 --> 45:59.600
Rachel googled...

45:59.600 --> 46:01.600
We used to say, we say Scrowdy Ralph all the time,

46:01.600 --> 46:04.400
in reference to a thing that's not the nicest that it could possibly be.

46:05.040 --> 46:06.240
Yeah, it's a little Scrowdy Ralph.

46:06.240 --> 46:08.560
And Rachel heard me say that and said, that's not a real thing.

46:08.560 --> 46:10.720
And I said, it definitely is, and then googled it.

46:10.720 --> 46:15.200
And the only result was a joystick post that Justin had written like four years ago.

46:15.200 --> 46:16.560
So it isn't invented.

46:17.280 --> 46:18.080
It is not real.

46:21.040 --> 46:23.840
Yeah, so now as far as adopting these phrases,

46:24.400 --> 46:25.680
that would make me a little nervous.

46:25.680 --> 46:29.600
Because I can't imagine an office where someone said,

46:30.560 --> 46:32.560
I'm just going to come up with a few different things

46:32.560 --> 46:35.600
and see how long before the new hires start using them.

46:35.600 --> 46:39.120
In which case, that's kind of cool and you're playing along.

46:39.120 --> 46:42.800
But like, I would make sure that those are going around elsewhere.

46:42.800 --> 46:46.320
Maybe you need to be at a certain level of the office to be able to use those.

46:46.320 --> 46:48.240
Like, you're like, yeah, there's a little hair on that.

46:48.240 --> 46:50.800
And like, whoa, that's a middle management thing.

46:50.800 --> 46:51.840
That's kind of our thing.

46:51.840 --> 46:54.080
We've earned that because we've been here for a while.

46:54.880 --> 46:55.840
Now here's the thing.

46:55.840 --> 46:58.640
Throughout time and the English language,

47:00.080 --> 47:02.480
none of our idioms were just there.

47:02.480 --> 47:04.240
All of them had to be invented at some point.

47:04.240 --> 47:07.440
So somebody had to say like, let's throw it at the wall and see what sticks.

47:07.440 --> 47:07.920
Hold on.

47:07.920 --> 47:09.120
Somebody else had to go, what the fuck?

47:09.120 --> 47:12.480
Does this person maybe work at like an idiom factory?

47:12.480 --> 47:13.920
That's what I'm saying.

47:13.920 --> 47:16.800
Maybe you're in a think tank that's just there to come up with idioms.

47:16.800 --> 47:20.880
Your real job is a ruse.

47:20.880 --> 47:24.800
It's not a real, like, yeah, we make the little things

47:24.800 --> 47:26.480
that hold the toilet paper and bathrooms.

47:26.480 --> 47:26.880
You're not.

47:26.880 --> 47:28.400
There's plenty of people who already do that.

47:28.400 --> 47:30.080
You're currently being Truman showed.

47:30.080 --> 47:32.160
You are being Truman showed and you've got to come up.

47:32.160 --> 47:34.560
You are under a lot of pressure right now to come up with idioms

47:34.560 --> 47:36.240
that we can pass on to our children.

47:36.240 --> 47:37.200
Let's just put it this way.

47:37.200 --> 47:38.800
If you don't start coming up with some of your own,

47:38.800 --> 47:39.840
it's show and prove time.

47:39.840 --> 47:41.520
You may have to hit the bricks.

47:41.520 --> 47:44.560
Yeah, or else you're going to be like a puppy on a skateboard on a boat.

47:45.120 --> 47:47.440
Listen, you are up to your eyeballs in alligators right now,

47:47.440 --> 47:48.480
and you need to get it together.

47:48.480 --> 47:48.720
Yeah.

47:48.720 --> 47:51.360
I am exposed in my job.

47:51.360 --> 47:56.560
I'm exposed to a sort of surprising amount of corporate speak,

47:56.560 --> 47:59.520
the kind of language I never thought I would hear growing up.

48:00.880 --> 48:02.720
Like lewd curse words?

48:02.720 --> 48:04.720
No, like adult language.

48:04.720 --> 48:10.400
No, like synchronize synergy.

48:10.400 --> 48:14.160
Now, I heard one for the first time this last summer.

48:15.200 --> 48:18.240
We were at a game developers studio

48:18.240 --> 48:19.680
and they were going to show us some secret stuff

48:20.240 --> 48:23.840
and they referred to it as opening the kimono.

48:23.840 --> 48:28.960
Now, if you have not heard this expression, it's ghoulish.

48:28.960 --> 48:31.520
And there is a great temptation to say,

48:31.520 --> 48:32.960
I'm going to start saying that.

48:32.960 --> 48:33.760
Don't.

48:33.760 --> 48:36.160
What's under the kimono?

48:36.160 --> 48:38.080
Does that mean they're inviting you to a swinger party?

48:38.080 --> 48:38.560
I'm going to-

48:38.560 --> 48:39.120
Who wants to see-

48:39.120 --> 48:40.160
Listen, we just brought you guys here.

48:40.160 --> 48:42.640
We're just going to open the kimono, just show you.

48:42.640 --> 48:45.760
And that's like, it's the expression for like, show you everything.

48:45.760 --> 48:48.000
And this is like a business thing.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.400
Who wants to see Mario's penis?

48:51.040 --> 48:53.520
We're going to open the kimono and happy ending.

48:53.520 --> 48:55.760
Because that's on special order today.

48:55.760 --> 48:58.400
It's Mario and Wario's penis.

48:58.400 --> 49:01.280
Two penises at once underneath this sweet kimono.

49:01.280 --> 49:02.480
I tell you what, if you're at home

49:02.480 --> 49:05.440
and you've heard a cool business expression,

49:06.400 --> 49:08.640
business idiom being thrown around at your office,

49:08.640 --> 49:09.360
send it to us.

49:09.920 --> 49:11.360
Maybe we'll read some next week.

49:11.360 --> 49:15.120
Most of our business terminology that we use

49:16.480 --> 49:19.200
at my current employer, Polygon,

49:19.200 --> 49:23.040
are just things that we started joking about

49:23.600 --> 49:25.920
and then started saying unironically.

49:25.920 --> 49:29.200
So like, I heard the guys on You Look Nice Today

49:29.200 --> 49:32.400
say blue sky solutioneering, started saying it as a goof,

49:32.400 --> 49:34.000
and now we say it for real.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.120
Now we just actually say, let's blue sky solutioneer this.

49:38.320 --> 49:41.440
We often refer to ourselves as solutionaristas at work

49:41.440 --> 49:43.040
because we've got to figure out problems.

49:43.040 --> 49:44.720
And I wish that that was not true.

49:44.720 --> 49:47.440
Like if I come up with like a really good idea at work,

49:47.440 --> 49:49.360
sometimes I'll call it like the final solution.

49:56.800 --> 49:58.880
I'm dying, son of a bitch.

49:58.880 --> 49:59.520
All right.

49:59.520 --> 50:01.200
I don't want to do this podcast.

50:01.200 --> 50:02.080
I don't either.

50:02.080 --> 50:04.160
I don't think anybody else does too.

50:04.160 --> 50:04.800
I'm done with it.

50:04.800 --> 50:06.080
This has been my brother and my brother and me.

50:06.080 --> 50:08.080
It's an advice show for the Modron era.

50:08.080 --> 50:10.480
Thank you so much for listening.

50:10.480 --> 50:12.240
I'm sorry it got hostile.

50:14.480 --> 50:19.280
But I do want to thank everybody for tweeting about the show.

50:20.240 --> 50:27.120
Mike Kloss, Noah, Anna Ang, Anna Meyer, Brian Wildsmith,

50:27.120 --> 50:31.440
Grant Buell, as always, our dear friend, Michael Maney.

50:31.440 --> 50:32.960
If you haven't gotten a chance to check out

50:32.960 --> 50:37.120
his NBNBM origin comic, we posted a link to it.

50:37.120 --> 50:38.080
Man, it's beautiful.

50:38.080 --> 50:38.640
Make sure you get it.

50:38.640 --> 50:41.360
How about that Dr. Mudgeon art?

50:42.240 --> 50:46.240
Our dad's comic column, Dr. Mudgeon,

50:46.240 --> 50:48.160
he did a piece of art with all of us

50:48.160 --> 50:50.400
and our significant others in it.

50:50.400 --> 50:52.000
And it's really dope.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.320
Thank you to Dan Rubenstein, Samuel Doran,

50:54.320 --> 50:58.480
and Stoke Romance, Wicked Cheap, Bursar K. Greetness.

50:58.480 --> 51:00.560
And Rocky Horror is working on the next

51:00.560 --> 51:02.000
My Brother, My Brother and Me mixtape.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.760
So if you have any suggestions or requests,

51:03.760 --> 51:06.160
make sure you tweet at him at Rocky Horror.

51:06.160 --> 51:07.440
Oh, shit.

51:07.440 --> 51:08.160
Yeah.

51:08.160 --> 51:10.160
Is it going to have Skrillex in it, you think, this time?

51:10.800 --> 51:11.200
I don't know.

51:11.200 --> 51:13.280
I think he might do some dubstep breaks.

51:13.280 --> 51:13.520
Good.

51:14.080 --> 51:14.880
Maybe trip step.

51:14.880 --> 51:15.520
Who knows?

51:15.520 --> 51:16.000
Who knows?

51:17.040 --> 51:19.360
Griffin, did you want to thank anybody?

51:20.320 --> 51:22.640
I want to thank, of course, John Roderick,

51:22.640 --> 51:24.400
the long winters for the use of our theme song.

51:24.400 --> 51:27.440
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.800
I also want to thank John Roderick for the fruit basket he sent me.

51:30.800 --> 51:31.520
It was lovely.

51:31.520 --> 51:32.160
Did he really?

51:32.720 --> 51:33.040
Yeah.

51:33.840 --> 51:35.120
What the fuck?

51:35.120 --> 51:37.360
He heard I got engaged and he was like, hey, congratulations.

51:37.360 --> 51:42.640
Every week, every week, I push albums from that guy.

51:42.640 --> 51:45.440
And I don't, that's, that's it.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.920
Is it possible he just doesn't like you?

51:47.920 --> 51:49.360
I'm cutting off the gratitude train.

51:50.000 --> 51:50.640
No, I'm not.

51:50.640 --> 51:51.200
I'll keep it.

51:51.200 --> 51:51.840
I'll keep it going.

51:51.840 --> 51:52.800
I'm sorry.

51:52.800 --> 51:54.960

52:07.120 --> 52:09.920
that any human being has ever been in the history of mankind.

52:09.920 --> 52:12.720
And it's going to be probably, it's going to be real fun to listen to, I bet.

52:12.720 --> 52:13.280
Catch that.

52:14.080 --> 52:16.720
And anyway, Griffin, I believe you have one more question for us.

52:16.720 --> 52:18.000
Something for us to grow on.

52:18.000 --> 52:18.480
Yeah, sure.

52:18.480 --> 52:19.680
Something for us to ponder, chew on.

52:19.680 --> 52:21.440
Yeah, this one was sent in by Christopher.

52:21.440 --> 52:22.080
Thank you, Christopher.

52:22.080 --> 52:24.320

52:26.000 --> 52:27.040
Eel help.

52:27.040 --> 52:28.400
Has he gone crazy?

52:30.160 --> 52:30.720
Oh, sorry.

52:30.720 --> 52:31.840
One more time.

52:31.840 --> 52:32.880
Eel help.

52:32.880 --> 52:34.160

52:36.080 --> 52:36.880
I'm Travis McElroy.

52:36.880 --> 52:38.160
I'm Griffin McElroy.

52:38.160 --> 52:39.440
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

52:39.440 --> 52:40.000
Kiss your dad.

52:40.000 --> 52:54.880
Just going to wear it on the lips.
