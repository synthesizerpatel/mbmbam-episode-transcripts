00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:49.360
How close do you think you came to just eating? You just almost ate so much shit.

00:49.360 --> 00:51.680
Almost ate it. That would have been so bad.

00:54.240 --> 00:59.360
But it did something for Kelsey Grammer, right? We all remember when he ate shit famously off

00:59.360 --> 01:06.000
that one stage. Next year, Finding Neverland called him up. Hey, are you Fraser and also

01:06.000 --> 01:12.080
the guy who ate shit off that one stage? Love that, dude. Real good. Do you think if you'd

01:12.080 --> 01:16.240
fallen off the stage, Fraser would have called you and said, hey, you're in the club. Welcome

01:16.240 --> 01:19.280
to the club. That's not how the show starts. You're right. So hold on.

01:21.680 --> 01:25.040
Hello and welcome to my brother, my brother meeting advice show for the modern era. I'm

01:25.040 --> 01:36.400
your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. And I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.080
And I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

01:46.080 --> 01:57.120
I'm sorry for the faces I made during the first 30 seconds or so of us being on stage.

01:57.120 --> 02:07.200
We ate a lot of velvet taco. But the important thing is not how much we ate, I would argue.

02:07.200 --> 02:12.160
But in fact, the timeline in which we ate it because it arrived five minutes ago.

02:12.160 --> 02:20.800
We slammed it. We have been making noises that are not the traditional toots and burps,

02:22.080 --> 02:29.280
but new sounds, exciting sounds from new places. New fresh sounds. If you fill the bagpipe with

02:29.280 --> 02:36.160
Jell-O and maybe some Gak from the 90s. We made a glomp. It came from my chest.

02:36.160 --> 02:45.280
My elbow made a slurp sound. We had a this is not a joke. We had a pretty serious two minute

02:45.280 --> 02:50.160
conversation backstage where we try to think if we can make a bit out of us needing like five

02:50.160 --> 02:55.360
minutes just to sit up here while you talk amongst yourselves to digest. And we promised like we'd

02:55.360 --> 03:00.400
like we get you back at the end. We'd go longer. Like we weren't wasting your time. We just needed

03:00.400 --> 03:06.960
some time up here. So far here in Dallas, we did the Adventure Zone last night and

03:09.440 --> 03:17.040
thank you very much. It's a D&D podcast that we. Well, it's an RPG podcast. But it's been a very

03:17.040 --> 03:23.120
eventful two days. So we did the show and also there was like some kind of. There was like a

03:23.120 --> 03:30.880
college prom last night, like an SMU formal at our hotel, literally outside my window. And y'all,

03:30.880 --> 03:42.800
our nation is facing a crisis. And it's that there hasn't been a party rock anthem released

03:42.800 --> 03:50.320
in like eight years because they were playing no joke fucking back to back shots. Yeah. Gangnam

03:50.320 --> 03:56.560
style. Yeah. And it's like, are we just done? Did Side Do Gangnam style? And we're like,

03:56.560 --> 04:01.920
that's it. No more party rock. To be fair. Yeah. Oh, they also played party rock.

04:03.520 --> 04:09.680
Um, but another night, Joe. So Conight Joe was in there also, which is. Yeah. But what you're

04:09.680 --> 04:14.240
wondering about, sometimes dad comes to us before we go on stage. Like when we first arrive in a

04:14.240 --> 04:19.440
city, it usually is within the first 12 hours of arriving on the scene. Dad comes to us and he says,

04:19.440 --> 04:24.880
Hey, I've got your pre-show bit. And he doesn't say it in those words. He says it with other

04:24.880 --> 04:33.040
words. But what we hear is, Hey, good news. Your pre-show bit is settled. Our dad brushed his teeth

04:33.920 --> 04:41.920
with capsaicin cream. So what's that? And you don't know capsaicin is a,

04:41.920 --> 04:47.200
it's a cream people use for pain relief. And the capsaicin is of course the same chemical in very

04:47.200 --> 04:57.760
hot peppers. And here's the thing. When papa told us that I would have equally believed the mistake

04:57.760 --> 05:05.040
or I was curious. Yeah. I wanted to try. I want it. I just wanted to find out. Let me find out.

05:05.040 --> 05:08.960
Maybe he did it for his sons who he loves so they can have a good intro bit for podcasts.

05:08.960 --> 05:14.480
That would be the only thing to explain why he does it every fucking time. Well, and this is

05:14.480 --> 05:19.600
the thing. New creams I should know, not always capsaicin. It's always some different cream. I

05:19.600 --> 05:27.200
think that this is very insightful to see like the, the chain from our dad to us because how it works,

05:28.480 --> 05:33.440
your story goes in here. So dad will do something embarrassing and then tell us in an embarrassed

05:33.440 --> 05:38.720
way, but then get a funny reaction to it. And eventually he's bragging about it to people.

05:39.280 --> 05:43.200
Where he'll say like, I don't tell people about how I brush my teeth with capsaicin.

05:43.200 --> 05:46.400
It's actually very instructive in your own life. If you have shame,

05:46.400 --> 05:52.400
try to own it like our dad does. Yeah. Our dad's like, if our dad fucks up super bad,

05:52.400 --> 05:56.560
he feels bad about it. And by the end of the week, he's like, could we do a t-shirt of this

05:56.560 --> 06:02.800
bad thing that I did? This bad fuck up that I fucked up. It's a good launch pad for your children's

06:02.800 --> 06:06.880
careers too. I don't even know if he was thinking about it that way. For instance, 20 years ago when

06:06.880 --> 06:11.520
he cut his butt wide open with a window scream and had to duct tape it shut with a maxi pad.

06:11.520 --> 06:16.800
I don't know if he was thinking about it when he did it like, oh, they're going to love this though.

06:17.600 --> 06:22.480
I don't know if he was thinking about it when he held a huge tray of cold cuts and a truck

06:22.480 --> 06:28.000
drove past him so close that it hit him with the side view mirror and sent fucking ham flying

06:28.000 --> 06:34.800
everywhere. Now I know what you're asking. Where was he? How close do you have to be to have cold

06:34.800 --> 06:40.640
cuts and truck? I think it was just like at the park. Who was in the wrong place? The truck or

06:40.640 --> 06:45.120
our dad? I have a very clear memory of being like 12 years old and driving to the hospital

06:45.120 --> 06:49.760
and a lady that dad worked with was praying over him and I can very much remember thinking,

06:49.760 --> 06:57.040
he does not deserve that. Ma'am, please do not bother God with this, okay? What happened?

06:57.040 --> 07:03.360
The truck and cold cut. That is the first time I've heard that one. That was me. I'm trying to

07:03.360 --> 07:12.080
launch a comedy podcast up here. See you in 20 years, boys. Wait, what? What? So anyway, we do-

07:12.080 --> 07:17.440
We are going to be making a ham delivery tomorrow and get hit by one big truck and it'll be a

07:17.440 --> 07:22.160
beautiful karmic moment. So as you've almost certainly guessed, we do an advice show. Untraditional,

07:22.960 --> 07:26.080
but you want to start with the Yahoo? I do want to start with the Yahoo. This one was

07:26.080 --> 07:34.320
This one was sent in by Merit Palmer. Thank you, Merit. It's Yahoo Answers User? Question mark?

07:34.880 --> 07:40.480
But not like it's not loading properly. That's their fucking name. That's what they've gone with.

07:41.280 --> 07:47.760
Question mark asks, I have an idea for a syrup. How can I go about selling it commercially?

07:47.760 --> 07:56.080
You've heard of maple syrup. Have you heard of weeping willow syrup? It's a new ex- It doesn't

07:56.080 --> 08:02.880
have syrup in it. How did you- I squeezed it so hard. I don't even think this person has gotten

08:02.880 --> 08:08.480
to the production stage. Yeah. It sounds like what they have done and said, I know a flavor I like

08:08.480 --> 08:16.240
is tomatoes. I know I love the viscosity of syrup. How can I bring these two things together?

08:17.040 --> 08:24.240
There's that one weeping willow- Honey, honey, wake up. I've done it. Stone syrup. What? Stone

08:24.240 --> 08:29.520
syrup. What's the most expensive substance on earth? Diamonds. I'd like to talk to you today.

08:31.280 --> 08:36.000
It looks like Mark is going to be a good guy. He's going to be a good guy.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.360
It looks like Mark's out. He does not want to invest in diamond syrup.

08:43.040 --> 08:50.400
I have a new idea for syrup. Have we not explored all of the syrup that there is? Apparently not.

08:51.520 --> 08:56.560
Because here's the thing, if this is just like add flavor to it like blueberry, it's maple syrup,

08:56.560 --> 09:01.040
but with blueberry in it, that's nothing. That's nothing. I can do that. We're all doing our own

09:01.040 --> 09:07.280
flavor experiments at home with syrup all the time. What is this new syrup that's going to

09:07.280 --> 09:15.600
change the fucking game? Maybe it's not the flavor. It is the practical use case of the syrup.

09:15.600 --> 09:22.880
Engine syrup. Engine syrup. Make your car go zoom. Make your car sweet. Sweet operation on this car.

09:22.880 --> 09:28.640
Edible. Edible engine syrup. Finally. Any time- You ever pour motor oil in your car and think,

09:28.640 --> 09:35.440
fuck, that looks good? Listen, we've all been there. Now it's engine syrup we've rebranded.

09:37.200 --> 09:45.680
Can we frame it so that your car is a hungry mouth and then all the stuff you put into it

09:46.240 --> 09:53.120
is food for car? Listen, we got engine syrup. We got go soup. We got it all. We got bottom donuts.

09:53.120 --> 10:03.200
What are tires? Yes. Okay. I call those bottom donuts now. That sounds deeply sexual. Yes. Yes.

10:03.200 --> 10:07.600
That's part of the appeal. It's going to make it pop on the aisle of the Pep Boys. That's very on

10:07.600 --> 10:14.080
trend with millennials. We need tires. These bottom donuts cost $200 more than the tires.

10:14.080 --> 10:20.880
That's right. They're so sexual. I know you meant like A-I-S-L-E of the Pep Boys,

10:20.880 --> 10:29.440
but what I heard was aisle of the Pep Boys. Welcome to Pep Boys aisle. Can you survive?

10:30.720 --> 10:33.280
There's three of us and one of you. Do the math.

10:37.680 --> 10:40.160
How about a question? The problem with new syrup. Okay.

10:42.080 --> 10:48.000
If you're saying what the name of it is, it's going to be confusing if it goes on that thing

10:48.000 --> 10:53.040
or not. Maple syrup, no one thinks, oh, I'm going to put syrup on a maple. That doesn't make any

10:53.040 --> 11:01.440
sense. What? Hot dog syrup is like- Oh, shit. Is this flavored like a hot dog in syrup form

11:01.440 --> 11:08.000
or is this syrup for my hot dog? That's the biggest problem with hot dog syrup. I absolutely agree.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.320
Yeah. No matter which way that cookie crumbles, it's going to be a hard pass.

11:12.320 --> 11:21.920
Yes. It's going to be a firm no. What if it's good?

11:27.040 --> 11:30.000
You didn't tell me it was good hot dog syrup.

11:30.800 --> 11:34.720
No, it's obviously good hot dog syrup. Does that mean the hot dog syrup is good

11:34.720 --> 11:39.600
or that it was expressed from good hot dog? If the hot dog syrup isn't good,

11:39.600 --> 11:43.920
why is Mark Cuban giving me all this money? He loves it.

11:47.440 --> 11:54.160
Here's a question from somebody here. Recently, my boyfriend started up a blogging platform

11:54.160 --> 11:59.760
for reviewing pizza from local establishments. Everything from the info pages to the username

11:59.760 --> 12:05.280
are pizza themed. The problem is he doesn't review the pizza, but instead reviews the

12:05.280 --> 12:09.760
establishment's features and amenities such as the civil ware, table mats, and bathrooms.

12:12.080 --> 12:15.360
He usually concludes the review with a single sentence about the pizza.

12:15.360 --> 12:19.360
Yep. Usually something brief and simple like the margarita pizza was okay.

12:21.120 --> 12:25.520
How do I help him improve his platform's reach and review quality while hinting to him

12:25.520 --> 12:30.400
that not even trying to review the pizza he eats at different locations is probably not the best

12:30.400 --> 12:37.600
idea? That's from Frustrated and Flower Mound. Are you here? Okay, wait. Hold on. Hello. Thank you

12:37.600 --> 12:41.040
for coming. Thank you. Thank you for being here. Thank you for buying a ticket. Thank you for

12:41.040 --> 12:48.400
sending in a question. I do have to ask, is boyfriend here? Okay. This fucking kills me,

12:48.400 --> 12:55.840
so I guess you found a way to tell him, huh? Fuck. You're just going to fucking enlist me

12:55.840 --> 13:04.880
in your struggles, okay? What I got here is step one. Now he had to hear it from his all-time hero,

13:04.880 --> 13:11.440
okay? Great. It's the opposite of hitting a home run for the sick kid in the hospital.

13:11.440 --> 13:16.240
This is the opposite. It's hitting it, but it smashes through the window and hits the sick kid

13:16.240 --> 13:19.680
because everybody else is going to love the great home run. Except for that one.

13:19.680 --> 13:28.480
You have one crazy long hair. Are you seeing this shit? Whoa. Holy shit. Don't derail the show.

13:28.480 --> 13:40.480
They're not going to be able to enjoy that. Get it out. Get it out. It was so long. Here's the

13:40.480 --> 13:52.000
thing. Question asker, you are wrong. Sorry. Sorry. And boyfriend blogger is right. It sounds

13:52.000 --> 13:56.720
great. Honestly, it sounds great. Because that's all I want. When I go on Yelp, I don't care about

13:56.720 --> 14:04.240
the fucking food. Charles Dickens could write a book called A Tale of Three Pizzas in which he

14:04.240 --> 14:09.440
takes 600 pages to describe the three most lovely pizzas he's ever eaten. That's not going to put

14:09.440 --> 14:16.560
the fucking pizza in my mouth, Charles. All I need is one sentence that's just, is it good or is it

14:16.560 --> 14:23.440
okay or is it bad? And then if you want to dedicate a whole blog post to, for instance, do the locks

14:23.440 --> 14:30.000
on the bathroom doors work properly, now you're in my fucking wheelhouse. Not only do they fucking

14:30.000 --> 14:33.600
work, but does it look like they've put six different lock options and only one of them works?

14:33.600 --> 14:38.640
I don't trust that shit. Only one of them works? This is all I think about any time I go. I scope

14:38.640 --> 14:44.320
out the B room and I make sure that it's good for me. Six locks and only one of them works?

14:44.320 --> 14:50.880
What makes me think that sixth one is not going to give out during my tenure? That actually,

14:51.600 --> 14:54.960
we're going to get back to this in one second. I did want to briefly derail. Right before the show,

14:54.960 --> 14:59.040
I walked out. There's a long hall away from our dressing room that goes to the bathroom

14:59.600 --> 15:04.480
and there was a security guard sitting in the hall. So don't fucking try anything. Nice try.

15:04.480 --> 15:12.800
And as I passed him, I'm sort of, I don't know what to, I always feel indebted. Like thank you

15:12.800 --> 15:18.240
for, thank you for your service, for protecting my life. So I give him like a, I told, I actually

15:18.240 --> 15:22.720
told him I just ate too many tacos. And then I was going, I went to the bathroom and the bathroom

15:22.720 --> 15:29.280
didn't have a lock on it. And then I was like, well, I don't know what to do. And then I was

15:29.280 --> 15:36.160
like, well, there's that security guard. And it's not exactly clear what he's guarding,

15:36.160 --> 15:41.440
but if he's trying to guard me and your treasure and my sort of continued existence,

15:42.240 --> 15:50.080
I did go back out and ask him like, if you do see anybody, if anybody, if anybody's coming this way,

15:50.080 --> 15:54.960
just give him a heads up. Cause I have no lock. I don't think he said, yeah, why do you think I'm

15:54.960 --> 15:59.520
here? That's why I'm here, Justin. Don't worry about it. To guard your bathroom experience. Yeah, dude. I know.

15:59.520 --> 16:06.560
I know. Yeah, dude. Don't tell me how to do my job. When I'm looking up restaurant reviews,

16:07.280 --> 16:13.040
all I care about is like, I need a whole review that's just like, you won't regret coming here.

16:13.040 --> 16:17.920
And I don't mean the food. I mean you, Travis McElroy, will feel like you've made the right choice.

16:17.920 --> 16:28.240
The right choice. Oh boy. If you could have it in review whether or not there is check candy.

16:30.000 --> 16:36.240
So you know going in that you're going to get check candy. Would you want that? I think I would. But wait.

16:37.440 --> 16:44.000
Isn't that a spoiler? Isn't that very exciting? One of the few joys of adult life

16:44.000 --> 16:49.280
when the check comes, you're like, oh, but then there's like an Andes mint. So you're like, okay.

16:49.280 --> 16:55.040
Oh, but it could also be. Free food. Nice. I guess I got one over on you. Well, I guess I will be

16:55.040 --> 17:03.040
having dessert tonight. Yeah. Unless. Unless. It's one of those green mints and you don't know whether

17:03.040 --> 17:11.680
it's tropical flavored or spearmint. No stars. Great ambiance. Pizza's the best I've ever eaten.

17:11.680 --> 17:17.840
They gave me one of those tricky mints. I will tell you what would give me a no star review right off

17:17.840 --> 17:23.520
the bat. No clear indication as to whether I should ask for the check or walk up and pay at the counter.

17:25.120 --> 17:31.520
That is a that is a no star review for me right there. I can't. I've sat at a table for 20 minutes

17:31.520 --> 17:36.800
because there's nothing worse than the fear of like just going up to somebody like here is this

17:36.800 --> 17:43.440
is this for you? Are you an adult? Are you? Can you handle this? I just want to go fix for me.

17:43.440 --> 17:50.960
Thanks for Justin. Here is money. Justin give money. You let leave. And have you ever noticed

17:50.960 --> 17:55.440
that when you do get it wrong and you try to give your waitress some money, they will fucking

17:55.440 --> 18:01.120
destroy every time they are so pleased to be able to say, oh no, no, no, no, no. You're gonna have

18:01.120 --> 18:09.680
to march up there and face what you did alone and buy some chiclets too. I have a yahoo here.

18:09.680 --> 18:15.040
This one was uh sent in by Adrian Cowles. Thank you Adrian. Sent in a ton of good ones. Thank you.

18:15.040 --> 18:25.680
It's from cool cat 4567. Who had to whose fucking house was on fire but they just had to pick a yahoo

18:25.680 --> 18:34.160
name real fast. Cool cat 4567. Cool cat's taking shit. Get the dog. I'm a cool cat. What else matters?

18:36.320 --> 18:42.880
I touched a supposedly haunted piano that didn't know was haunted. Am I screwed?

18:47.280 --> 18:53.520
Okay wait. Read it one more time. Yeah there's something. I touched I touched a supposedly

18:53.520 --> 19:00.080
haunted piano comma that didn't know was haunted comma am I screwed? Are they saying

19:01.840 --> 19:07.040
is this another hot dog syrup situation? No are they saying the piano didn't know it was haunted?

19:08.480 --> 19:12.480
Like the piano is haunted but the piano is not aware of a haunting status? Okay okay there's

19:12.480 --> 19:17.120
no such thing as a piano ghost which is to say a piano that gets killed in a terrible passion and

19:17.120 --> 19:21.760
then levitate spirit. A piano but what about those pianos that like fall when they're trying to

19:21.760 --> 19:28.320
hoist it up? Still no spectral energy latent spectral energy inside the piano. Now a human ghost

19:28.320 --> 19:35.600
gets put in the piano. Now we're talking. Now we're cooking baby. Now we've got a little

19:35.600 --> 19:42.160
ferro vehicle. Do they know that they're a piano? Second question does the piano know it's a ghost?

19:44.320 --> 19:49.440
You know one funny thing about me hey other fellow living humans one weird thing about me

19:49.440 --> 19:55.760
is when people tickle me I sing beautiful music. I had not words just kind of a beautiful music

19:55.760 --> 20:00.400
kind of a bing bing bing. I love that this could be one of those good ghost movies and he's trying

20:00.400 --> 20:05.600
to like tell his wife and kids I love you I miss you I'm sorry about the big wreck I did that I

20:05.600 --> 20:12.240
beefed it. It's so bad on the carpet. And they see him and then he's like wait I love you I have so

20:12.240 --> 20:20.240
much in me but then the wife and kids just here run away. No! And so he literally has to be

20:20.240 --> 20:26.320
self-taught how to play piano. Yes backwards because he's inside. By the way Black Mirror

20:26.320 --> 20:30.640
season five trademark trademark trademark. Obviously we're gonna sell it. I've got it I've got

20:30.640 --> 20:36.880
it I've got it I've got the setup. Piano falls from a crane crushes a person they rebuild the

20:36.880 --> 20:42.880
piano. Fusion! They rebuild the piano what's that now the spear or maybe the whole person's in there

20:42.880 --> 20:49.840
I don't know how good they are at rebuilding pianos. Maybe it's every time you hit that the

20:49.840 --> 20:57.440
second octave f sharp key you see your person like I'm in this one. I'm sorry Steve you're

20:57.440 --> 21:02.240
half piano half man now you're a piano man. Yeah I can now sing us a song.

21:02.240 --> 21:10.640
He's piano man but he does have a gun that comes out of his leg and he uses to shoot burps it's

21:10.640 --> 21:16.800
weird it's not connected he actually had that before the accident before the accident and we

21:16.800 --> 21:21.920
thought this made sense because you were already part robot. Hey piano man is actually pretty good

21:21.920 --> 21:26.320
like uh ghost that's half piano half man that's actually pretty good. Yeah good joke. TM TM no

21:26.320 --> 21:30.560
no no like good idea to sell. Oh okay. I was thinking people always tell us we don't appreciate

21:30.560 --> 21:35.040
Travis's jokes enough and so I wanted to put a pin in this one so that they would stop telling me

21:35.040 --> 21:42.560
that. Hang a lantern on it. Oh need a bit. One sec real quick drink all right I'm ready to do more

21:42.560 --> 21:47.440
podcast. Okay and we're back. Hello welcome back you've joined us already in progress.

21:49.440 --> 21:55.520
Okay I'll take I'll take drinks more often then. My boss has a habit of coming out of his office

21:55.520 --> 22:01.280
into the bullpen loudly saying a single word then returning to his office. Mostly these words

22:01.280 --> 22:15.600
pertain to our work. Meeting. Parking. Cash. Cattle. Cattle. Okay. Cattle. We gotta park the cows.

22:15.600 --> 22:25.440
She bull. Whoa boss. Uh but yesterday. Scannered. Free bird. Yesterday I was having lunch and

22:25.440 --> 22:32.000
eating a slice of homemade cake at my desk. My boss walked past my cubicle and shouted cake

22:34.160 --> 22:41.200
and stood there. Nice. I made awkward eye contact for about 15 seconds and said

22:41.200 --> 22:49.760
yes and then turned around. 15 seconds is the perfect comedy amount of time to have waited

22:49.760 --> 22:53.760
for that answer. Actually you know what I'm just going to use the the timer right here. Oh Jesus

22:53.760 --> 22:58.000
Christ. Travis this is what that would have felt like okay. I'll be the person and you be the boss

22:58.000 --> 23:19.040
okay. Ready. Cake. Yes. It's perfect. And that's 15 seconds of podcast that we don't have to do.

23:19.600 --> 23:24.480
It's just done. We'll edit that down when you listen to it at home later. It'll it'll be more

23:24.480 --> 23:30.480
like eight seconds. Um I made uh and then I turned around my chair and I ate my cake while not looking

23:30.480 --> 23:35.440
up to make further eye contact. So you don't know how much longer the boss was there. Days.

23:36.480 --> 23:41.120
Uh did my boss want some of my cake? Did he want a conversation about the cake?

23:41.840 --> 23:46.480
Brothers what should I do next time he addresses one of these one-word shouts in my direction?

23:46.480 --> 23:52.000
That's from Caked and Confused in Cowtown. Maybe your boss had only ever read about cake but never

23:52.000 --> 23:58.480
actually seen it. There is. Cake. There's that fluffy stuff. And then when you confirmed his

23:58.480 --> 24:04.880
identification. Yes. Nailed it. Nice. Great. No because if that was the case like nobody hears

24:04.880 --> 24:12.160
about cake their whole life sees cake for the first time and is like all right bye anyway cool

24:12.160 --> 24:16.800
I'm gonna walk away with that taste of that wonderful stuff. I want I wish that the boss

24:16.800 --> 24:24.320
would move to next cubicle and just be like cereal. Or cake. No not at this one. No cake here.

24:25.520 --> 24:30.320
Keep looking. No. And then somebody's like eight cubicles down eating cake like oh fuck.

24:33.760 --> 24:39.920
Is it possible that this is not just a boss but it is a boss baby? Or

24:39.920 --> 24:49.360
a big situation? Or both big boss baby? Yeah. Which is the premise of the question we're talking

24:49.360 --> 24:54.080
about now and also the villain of the next Metal Gear Solid game. Very excited about that.

24:55.760 --> 25:03.120
Just confirmed actually. Just confirmed. A big boss baby baby climbed up into the Zoltan machine

25:04.160 --> 25:09.680
because that's what they do. I've had a baby for 16 months now I get like nine ten claw machines

25:09.680 --> 25:14.400
can't take this kid to a Dave and Buster's. One time he got stuck in two different claw machines

25:14.400 --> 25:19.600
at one Dave and Buster's trip. What am I supposed to do? Stop going to Dave and Buster's?

25:21.600 --> 25:27.920
Watch your kid? Come on. Got blown up into Tom Hanks. Showed up to work the next day.

25:28.640 --> 25:34.880
Apple. No. What? What? Juice. Do you want juice? You want juice? Juice.

25:34.880 --> 25:41.360
Juice. Yes you want juice. Apple. Apple. Do you want apple juice or do you want an apple?

25:41.360 --> 25:49.120
Cake. Cake. No. No. No. What are you even saying no to?

25:51.360 --> 25:55.200
You're my boss. Boss? You can't cry in front of me. You're my boss.

25:55.200 --> 26:03.840
Boom boom. Did you did you make boom boom? You're my boss. I don't have to clean that up. Yes.

26:05.680 --> 26:11.760
This is the role Tom was born to play. Now in order for this to work. The role that Tom Hanks

26:11.760 --> 26:16.240
was born to play was in the music video for I Really Really Like You. Every other role has been

26:16.240 --> 26:21.520
ancillary. It has to be like a couple times it's really paid off and they're like this guy's got

26:21.520 --> 26:25.360
some great idea so it's like I don't know we need to get some new computers for the office but what

26:25.360 --> 26:31.760
kind should we get? Apple. Hey. Hey all right. Good idea. And the year is 1983 so he's like very.

26:31.760 --> 26:39.600
Yeah it's cutting edge. Sort of out in front of it. Computers I mean. And this man's name was

26:39.600 --> 26:46.560
Steve Jobs. And they were like what's an apple computer and he's like exactly. Welcome to the

26:46.560 --> 26:59.520
future start making them. How about a yahoo? Yeah let's hit the yahoo. I get nervous. Yeah I just.

26:59.520 --> 27:02.800
Now here's where I get nervous because we're about halfway through what we're calling act

27:02.800 --> 27:07.680
one of tonight's festivities and usually that's where you say yeah Griffin go ahead and do your

27:07.680 --> 27:18.560
work up there and then I start doing my work and you're tapping on the iPad a lot. This just popped

27:18.560 --> 27:24.560
up. I just got a notification this just popped up. Wait what app do you get ghost notification

27:24.560 --> 27:28.160
haunted doll notifications? If I told you then everybody would get it and the segment wouldn't

27:28.160 --> 27:35.680
be special anymore. Okay. It's Google Maps. It's Google Maps. It's April Fool's thing they're

27:35.680 --> 27:41.920
doing. Haunted porcelain doll with orbs slash paranormal slash stunning.

27:45.440 --> 27:52.320
We never we talk about the orbs so much we never talk about how beautiful these dolls are.

27:52.320 --> 28:00.400
She's about to condition all caps in quotes exclamation point. Wonderful.

28:00.400 --> 28:09.680
Okay what does that mean? What a haunted doll. The condition of this doll is wonderful.

28:11.200 --> 28:16.880
Um first off check out the orbs.

28:16.880 --> 28:27.840
I had a mouth full of drink when you check the peep the orbs. Check out those or those orbs though.

28:27.840 --> 28:39.440
Like a 1980s music video. What those orbs do though. They'll fuck with your remote control.

28:39.440 --> 28:47.680
They'll fuck with your remote control. You cannot get this hung up on each line because it is like

28:47.680 --> 28:52.960
there's other journeys to go on here. This doll looks just like a real little girl.

28:56.000 --> 29:02.560
Such a realistic face. An absolutely gorgeous doll. Her pictures do not do her justice. Hey lady

29:02.560 --> 29:08.240
she's got a beauty that moves. Hey lady if the pictures don't do her justice take more pictures.

29:08.240 --> 29:16.480
It's a doll. It doesn't mind. Take more pictures until you get a picture that does it justice.

29:16.480 --> 29:23.200
Get some glamour shots. Here's a doll from an investigation in Savannah Georgia. Cold spots

29:23.200 --> 29:27.840
are often found in the room that she's placed in. Also thumping in the middle of the night.

29:29.680 --> 29:32.960
I have captured orbs in second photo so check it out.

29:32.960 --> 29:39.120
They want to make sure you've seen the orbs. We have also seen. We are currently reading more of

29:39.120 --> 29:44.800
the description without going to look at the orbs though which is kind of speaks to what we do on

29:44.800 --> 29:49.840
the show with Hanna doll watch that somebody's just said I captured ghost orbs in a photo and

29:49.840 --> 29:56.480
Justin said I'll get to those ghost orbs later. I have to keep reading. Okay well then I say I'm

29:56.480 --> 30:03.280
gonna have to go. I'm gonna. What are you typing? What could you control F ghost or I'm picking out

30:03.280 --> 30:09.600
the second image. Whoa check out those orbs. The orbs are not fucking anything. It's there's not

30:09.600 --> 30:14.400
a lens flare. I mean you all won't you know how every JJ Abrams movie is haunted. It's just a

30:14.400 --> 30:22.400
lens flare on the orb. It's nothing. You do photoshop effects generate orbs. Those photos do

30:22.400 --> 30:29.280
not do her justice. The photos don't do her justice. I can say that for sure. EVPs have been

30:29.280 --> 30:35.520
okay sorry I got tripped up but we have also seen her slightly moved to the side at times all on

30:35.520 --> 30:43.200
her own. She's a very beautiful doll. She has these very long golden locks of hair. EVPs have

30:43.200 --> 30:48.400
been recorded from her in the past. We believe she's a girl from around the age of nine. We

30:48.400 --> 30:54.320
this is the part of Haunted Doll Watch where we just. It gets sad in the middle. We have tried to

30:54.320 --> 31:01.600
communicate with her and asked her how she passed. We also received one EVP saying car. Okay. And

31:01.600 --> 31:16.400
another saying ham. So we believe it she talks about her car a lot. This is what it says. She

31:16.400 --> 31:21.520
talks about her car a lot. If you wish to adopt her into your home she can be yours. She also has

31:21.520 --> 31:26.320
an adorable giggle. Perhaps adorable is not what you would associate with a ghost giggle from a

31:26.320 --> 31:34.080
doll. Be prepared exclamation point no fucking context whatsoever. Just says be prepared. Make

31:34.080 --> 31:39.360
sure to put a towel in a cardboard box for her to live in. Because who knows. She needs a loving home

31:39.360 --> 31:43.600
so don't adopt her unless you're going to be good to her. Oh you don't fucking care. If she only

31:43.600 --> 31:48.320
pays the I'm going to guess thirty one dollars for this doll. You don't fucking care what kind

31:48.320 --> 31:54.720
of home it goes to. There's no screening process. By the way hundred dollars. Oh that's about it

31:54.720 --> 31:59.440
now. Thank you. My mistake. It is a beautiful. It is wild though. It's like be good to her. She's

31:59.440 --> 32:03.680
like one of my children. Anyway I'm going to put her up for sale on the Internet. Is that how you're

32:03.680 --> 32:08.320
good to people. Do you think is putting the children for sale on the Internet. Be good to

32:08.320 --> 32:14.000
her. Be prepared. Be prepared. Be prepared. And then this is another complete sentence. It just says

32:14.640 --> 32:23.200
nice big doll. If you're worried about it being haunted but being too small don't worry about

32:23.200 --> 32:31.520
that here. She's a nice big doll. Ghosts got a lot of elbow room. She is about a 24 inch doll

32:32.240 --> 32:37.120
from the top of the hat down. Thank you for clarifying because if I had gotten the doll and

32:37.120 --> 32:44.800
said well yeah if you count the hat I wanted a two foot tall doll. I could put my own hat on.

32:44.800 --> 32:50.960
Great. Just imagine I think for context the eyes of the doll would be just over the top of our table.

32:52.080 --> 32:56.400
Yeah. This is maybe. Picture it. And the orbs would be fucking crazy.

32:59.040 --> 33:02.560
This is maybe the most perplexing sentence in the whole thing. You're fucking kidding me. There's

33:02.560 --> 33:09.040
more perplexing stuff. Yeah this one's really perplexing. She's an expensive doll. Sells for

33:09.040 --> 33:17.840
around 300 to 400 dollars. Apparently not. I mean right. Like apparently not because you are selling

33:17.840 --> 33:24.560
it for 100 dollars. So like apparently not. Does having a ghost in the doll make it worth less.

33:24.560 --> 33:29.280
Less. Is it less valuable to capture a spectral ghost. If there was an antiques road show where

33:29.280 --> 33:38.720
they brought on a doll and the doll was like I don't know old and nice and belonged to you know

33:39.360 --> 33:46.240
Lincoln. And they were like wow I've never seen a doll in this. Is this Lincoln's. Yes. This has got

33:46.240 --> 33:54.720
to be worth a million dollars. Well one thing. Great condition. Beautiful doll. Big old doll.

33:54.720 --> 34:03.760
Big nice big. Nice big doll. Be prepared. There's a ghost in there. Are we still in a mint situation.

34:03.760 --> 34:07.920
Are we down to like. Oh it's like when someone cleans the patina off of the thing and they're

34:07.920 --> 34:12.160
like now if there wasn't a ghost in there. Yeah. It would be like three thousand to four thousand

34:12.160 --> 34:18.400
dollars. But with the ghost 20 bucks. I just feel like if you're the sort of person that would be

34:18.400 --> 34:23.920
concerned about the presence of a ghost in a doll is more of a binary thing right. Like it's not going

34:23.920 --> 34:30.480
to affect the sale price. It's going to be like no probably not. I don't actually think so because

34:30.480 --> 34:36.960
it's haunted and the home is where I live. So I don't think so. Can I do yahoo.

34:40.640 --> 34:49.360
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Guess. Who did you just check with. Death. Okay. Thank you daddy. It's yahoo answers.

34:49.360 --> 34:53.920
No not the user but Adrian Cowell sent this one in too. Thank you Adrian. It's yahoo answers. Well

34:53.920 --> 34:59.360
technically I think if you go on yahoo to find yahoo's for this show. You're a part of the

34:59.360 --> 35:05.440
fucking community. And I'm saying that risking losing all of these good folks who are doing

35:05.440 --> 35:14.240
this work for us but it calls them like I see them. User CPC 26 CA. This one's just fucking diarrhea.

35:14.240 --> 35:19.600
The other one at least had some direction. I am a cool cat. These are four sequential numbers.

35:20.640 --> 35:26.480
Maybe this is like a license plate. Maybe there's a code in there. It means something.

35:27.520 --> 35:36.000
I'm not going to do this joke. Am I. We can do that. Am I allowed to bring my Rubik's cube

35:36.000 --> 35:59.920
to a football game. Legally. Yes. Should that change. Yes. Imagine you just did one of the

35:59.920 --> 36:08.320
best touchdowns ever. Wait give me a second. They fumbled it. You ran it all the way back.

36:08.880 --> 36:14.160
One yard line. You fumbled it. They ran it back. Another fumble. You ran it back. Longest touchdown

36:14.160 --> 36:19.840
run in history. Incredible. You're living your dream. Right. Your hands in the air.

36:20.880 --> 36:25.920
You're living it. And then you look in the stands and there's just one person like hmm.

36:25.920 --> 36:34.320
Hmm. Fine. Anyway back to my puzzle. And that person was my football teacher.

36:37.600 --> 36:39.600
My football teacher Malcolm McDowell.

36:41.680 --> 36:46.080
All I wanted was for him to give me a certificate that said football grand master.

36:46.080 --> 36:50.000
Dude's got a fucking spiral on him though like I'll show you an outlier.

36:50.000 --> 37:00.480
Boom 130 yards. That's Malcolm Gladwell. Oh shit. I'm sure they get that all the time.

37:00.480 --> 37:07.840
I'll go get in the box. You you you shouldn't. If people are trying. They're performers.

37:08.400 --> 37:12.720
They're putting on a show just for you. You realize that's the only point. Okay okay okay.

37:12.720 --> 37:19.040
But in one four downs of football. Uh huh. There's only like eight seconds of football

37:19.040 --> 37:23.760
actually being played. And then it's like a half minute of like figuring out what the next one's

37:23.760 --> 37:28.720
going to be. Which is astounding to me because how many variations can there possibly be?

37:29.840 --> 37:34.480
You either throw it or you run with it or you kick it right? Am I missing something?

37:34.480 --> 37:40.640
There's so much. But there's a lot of down times. There's also Griffin there's also the

37:40.640 --> 37:45.120
times where you hide it under your jersey and pretend you're pregnant. That's a fourth category

37:45.120 --> 37:50.720
is I think fun-em-ups like are we going to run pass kick or do a funny fun one. So you're mighty

37:50.720 --> 37:56.480
ducks. Sounds like a mighty ducks fun one. Here go big greens. Did you guys remember there's a part

37:56.480 --> 38:02.000
in mighty ducks where Gordon Bombay gets mad at them for doing too many fun ducks stunts?

38:02.000 --> 38:08.080
It's like hey Gordon we're trying to enjoy the movie. Can you not get mad at them for having

38:08.080 --> 38:14.000
some fun with the hockey tricks? Whenever they call a timeout. Yeah. Which in a sport if you

38:14.000 --> 38:19.280
call a timeout that's basically you saying like we fucked up and we need to fix it right? And

38:19.280 --> 38:24.800
that's disrespectful of my time in the stands. I want to have some busy work. I want to if not

38:24.800 --> 38:29.440
have the whole time to play a game of Pokemon trading cards at least get my deck in order.

38:30.080 --> 38:35.200
At least solve one face of the Rubik's Cube. Are we running a danger though going up on the

38:35.200 --> 38:41.040
Jumbotron of the first period? Look at this nerdlinger. And then second period let's check

38:41.040 --> 38:48.320
back in. Oh yikes. Having a rough time there Griffin. It's all about the snake pattern. Do

38:48.320 --> 38:52.560
you need me to come down there and do it for you? And then you see you see one of the angels in the

38:52.560 --> 38:58.160
outfield behind him like no he's got it. He can do it. He's got. Okay now turn. Oh fuck no what

38:58.160 --> 39:05.600
was it? Uh let me do it. Shit. Uh. Let me solve it. God? Not mine. I can't figure those. Those are

39:05.600 --> 39:14.720
wild man. I don't know shit about those things. You know those the devil. Surprise. Um do we have

39:14.720 --> 39:21.360
time for one more? You wanna do another yahoo? Yes. And we're not leaving. Yeah. We're not leaving yeah

39:21.360 --> 39:26.320
we're just gonna pee. Um I can do it. I actually have a very good yahoo here. Okay. If I could do

39:26.320 --> 39:33.360
two in a row that's okay with everybody here. I kid you not Adrian Kells also sent this one in.

39:33.360 --> 39:38.960
Absolutely fucking crushed it. It's by question mark. Probably a different one. This time I think

39:38.960 --> 39:47.840
it was it didn't load because it's a a bad website. Uh they asked what are we gonna have

39:47.840 --> 39:57.760
for breakfast in 100 years from now? Thanks. Whatever it is it's gonna have good hot dog

39:57.760 --> 40:04.880
syrup on it. The finest. What I really like is I obviously they're asking like human beings but

40:04.880 --> 40:08.560
what it could also be it's like hey what do you guys want to have for breakfast 100 years from

40:08.560 --> 40:13.680
now? I just want to start planning now. Let's go ahead and get it out in front of it. It may be

40:13.680 --> 40:20.960
weird to think it's human beings because it could also be talking to the answer could be us by robots.

40:20.960 --> 40:28.320
Right. Humans. But assuming it's not about humans and we're still ruling shit 100 years from now

40:28.320 --> 40:36.000
no way. Um what are we gonna eat 100 years from future? Answer obvious ones. Computer eggs.

40:39.520 --> 40:45.040
X1. Are those eggs computers like? Kind of cyber cyber bacon. Cyber bacon.

40:45.040 --> 40:50.080
Oh man. Amazon toast.

40:52.640 --> 40:58.560
I I hope that in 100 years I will be able to vape all my meals. That is why I want to get

40:58.560 --> 41:04.400
vape nutrients. I want vape. I don't just want vape nutrients. I want vape satisfaction. I want

41:04.960 --> 41:11.360
a filling. I went to we went to Edith's uh Edith's cafe with the french stuff. As good as hell. As

41:11.360 --> 41:18.480
good as hell but I wish I had vaped it. I want that level of satisfaction. What I want and I know

41:18.480 --> 41:24.720
this is a long way off but what I want is a drone that will come to me and like bring me french toast

41:24.720 --> 41:30.640
while I sleep and open my mouth and put it in my mouth move my chin up and down massage my throat

41:30.640 --> 41:35.440
so I swallow it and I can just keep sleeping. And it would need to know your favorite song that it

41:35.440 --> 41:42.240
could play you if you wake up in the middle of this process. And a super sharp hypodermic needle

41:42.240 --> 41:48.240
so you wouldn't even notice the injection going in. Yeah. With the nanobots. I mean it'll be

41:48.240 --> 41:56.080

47:48.320 --> 47:53.360
new show on the maximum fun network that we'd love to share with you it's called Heat Rocks Morgan

47:53.360 --> 47:59.200
we should probably explain what a heat rock is it is a banger a fire track track track track

47:59.200 --> 48:04.480
fire track true fire right dope album each episode we will bring on a special guest to join us to

48:04.480 --> 48:09.040
talk about one of their heat rocks it might be a musician a writer maybe a scholar I mean I would

48:09.040 --> 48:13.280
have been happy to just talk to you about your heat rocks but this is a different show yeah I

48:13.280 --> 48:17.200
think people might enjoy hearing maybe the guests instead to do that you'll have to go to maximum

48:17.200 --> 48:23.200
fun.org so if you want to talk about hot music you should check us out heat rocks it's time to

48:23.200 --> 48:30.880
enter the gauntlet for you and for us lock the doors the gauntlet is our gauntlet it's not

48:30.880 --> 48:35.520
your gauntlet it's not a competition although there will be a winner and there will be a loser

48:36.800 --> 48:41.760
uh I'll do the pitch so here's the thing we're going to choose two people to come to the

48:41.760 --> 48:48.880
microphones they are going to tell us their names if they want to give us their pronouns

48:48.880 --> 48:55.840
if they're comfortable with that we love that if you if you see that as a uh hilarious rich vein

48:55.840 --> 49:03.440
of goofs don't that won't that won't go well for you trust and let me double down on that if you

49:03.440 --> 49:09.040
then see griffin saying don't make a joke out of it as a challenge of like oh but I think I still

49:09.040 --> 49:19.040
can we we are in the meat space this is not twitter we have microphones here uh so the uh and uh you'll

49:19.040 --> 49:26.080
give us your questions and uh we will choose the person not the person with like the zaniest or

49:26.080 --> 49:31.520
the funniest just the person we can help the most because honestly our toolbox you can't see it it's

49:31.520 --> 49:39.360
behind the table it's fairly small it's a limited also two rules other rules you know the first one

49:41.680 --> 49:45.920
that was no bummers if you have trouble making out a million voices at once that's right there's a

49:45.920 --> 49:53.120
million people here you all have set the world attendance record for and number two that mark

49:53.120 --> 50:00.400
marin number two number two our constant enemy and number two have it be a question and not just

50:00.400 --> 50:04.960
like a fun story or like a fun thing you saw okay if the ending of your question is am i good

50:06.880 --> 50:10.720
okay can we get house lights up and we're gonna start picking folks oh don't get up and dance

50:10.720 --> 50:14.960
around we just raise your hand and we will wow there's a big theater full house lights i think

50:14.960 --> 50:20.640
it's and maybe a little bit less stage lights okay hey what's up uh hi i'm sarah i'm super

50:20.640 --> 50:25.840
nervous um it's okay sarah you got this so my husband and i go to our local grocery store

50:25.840 --> 50:34.240
um pretty regularly buy groceries um good thing to do there for sure we can no longer go to the

50:34.240 --> 50:41.200
meat and seafood count counter there because the employee that is always there does not know how

50:41.200 --> 50:49.280
that exchange is supposed to work money for meat has been my understanding what is their

50:49.280 --> 50:56.480
understanding they hand you money do you have meat for me i don't know where we get the meat

50:56.480 --> 51:01.440
i just assume we buy it from people who come here it's a trading post i'm like an npc in a

51:01.440 --> 51:08.480
role playing game yes i will take your stringy buzzard meat here's 20 coin so it's worse than

51:08.480 --> 51:18.720
that actually um it's worse than that that was a joke go on so uh my husband and i didn't realize

51:18.720 --> 51:23.200
that this was happening to both of us until we both came home and complained about it um well

51:23.200 --> 51:28.720
ask for our meat or our seafood and he'll come out to give it to us and when we go to grab for

51:28.720 --> 51:46.560
it he'll pull it back and go too slow every time every time like we separately can count three or

51:46.560 --> 51:52.800
four times a piece okay sarah just hang tight sarah you've been through a lot okay hang on

51:54.080 --> 52:02.160
just hang in there one more second okay all right this is really scary wow i know imagine being us

52:03.920 --> 52:07.920
good point um so my name's adam i use they them pronouns what's up adam

52:10.880 --> 52:15.520
um so my question is kind of weird so like for for preface my dad's super affirming it's not

52:15.520 --> 52:20.720
the first time i've come out to him before um i'm really exceedingly queer in every way um

52:24.640 --> 52:28.720
and but my question is though is i have yet to come out to him as gender fluid now the thing

52:28.720 --> 52:34.480
is about coming out is that it's always a weird process even when it's affirming and i know the

52:34.480 --> 52:39.120
person is going to be affirming so my question is what's a really funny way to come out to my dad

52:39.120 --> 52:47.520
is gender fluid all right bye justin i'm trying to come up with questions we're less equipped to

52:47.520 --> 52:55.120
answer adam and frankly right now i'm drawing a blank hold on okay let me check the toolbox

52:55.120 --> 53:00.240
hold on let me look at the toolbox one sec oh no there's just a sandwich in here why didn't we only

53:00.240 --> 53:10.000
bring a sandwich oh no that's a that's a toffee adam that's so hard because you have to understand

53:10.000 --> 53:13.360
you're asking us to come up with funny adam i don't add

53:17.840 --> 53:22.880
where you need to think about jiff and jiff again adam here's the thing one day you'll be able to

53:22.880 --> 53:28.880
eat a jiff of jiff if that's still if that's become memetic yet maybe oh that's it lead with

53:28.880 --> 53:33.440
that when you're talking to your dad like hey dad what if one day dad i have went also yeah we're

53:33.440 --> 53:38.480
gonna help adam real quick just go to your dad and say listen i have two really funny things to

53:38.480 --> 53:47.520
tell you you're gonna love them both equally the second one isn't a joke and the first one is

53:47.520 --> 53:53.280
they're not both funny okay let me start over dad i'm sorry just let me leave the room and

53:53.280 --> 53:57.040
walk back in you're reading like this off a sheet of paper that you've transcribed of this exact

53:57.040 --> 54:04.160
podcast episode and i think that's gonna go real good so thank you adam i think we're

54:06.160 --> 54:12.560
we're doing both yeah we're doing both thank you adam adam thank you so much does that help

54:12.560 --> 54:25.600
wait hold on adam does that help maybe thank you adam you are going to have to train mind body

54:25.600 --> 54:32.400
so that here's my 20 let me get those uh little shrimp and he goes all right here

54:36.240 --> 54:42.080
and then he says you're ready you're and then you have to work now you're the meat yeah my husband's

54:42.080 --> 54:52.240
actually tried that move to like and it did not go over damn the back ramp to beef everywhere

54:52.240 --> 54:57.280
okay here's what so you're saying it's literally impossible to be faster than this guy like we

54:57.280 --> 55:03.120
either have to like go out of our way to go to a different grocery store or become vegetarians

55:06.000 --> 55:13.280
wow wow what uh one of my favorite things about having a baby is like to see uh humanity condensed

55:13.280 --> 55:18.560
into but because it's as much personality but in a very small thing and now when people do that

55:18.560 --> 55:25.520
like oh oh my baby's face is what every human being feels when that happens but unfiltered it's just

55:29.520 --> 55:38.320
and it's the best because it's like yeah that's what i feel hey you're gonna need if you if

55:38.320 --> 55:44.160
reflexes aren't getting it done and i still think y'all could push it a little bit harder

55:44.160 --> 55:52.480
you're gonna need like a a blow gun with some sort of neurotoxin or you're gonna have to partner

55:52.480 --> 55:57.120
with your husband right so you're standing there the person reaches out then what's that your

55:57.120 --> 56:05.840
husband comes and the meat and the meat salesman goes clever folks and then and then you eat him

56:05.840 --> 56:17.440
yeah no not like that no wait uh does that help or what if what if and you just wait oh

56:27.200 --> 56:29.600

waving their jacket oh god and y'all we gotta make examples sorry uh okay so my name's david

57:40.480 --> 57:49.440

57:49.440 --> 57:59.920
about a week ago i was eating breakfast at edith's oh nice yeah and an elderly man

58:01.040 --> 58:06.320
the raclette oh yeah my dad had that dad had that it's a bunch of cheese how are you feeling

58:06.320 --> 58:13.760
he said he says bad okay uh okay so so there was an elderly man that sat next to my wife and i

58:13.760 --> 58:20.880
wearing a red jacket approximately the same color and size as fashionable good okay um uh real quick

58:20.880 --> 58:23.920
the rest of the question it's not gonna be something mean about the red jacket right no

58:23.920 --> 58:27.920
not at all okay good because i'm very jealous of the red jacket if i had it right now i'd wear it

58:27.920 --> 58:33.360
go ahead so that's why i started up a conversation with him and i found out he was a retired marine

58:33.360 --> 58:40.240
cool cool okay and he said that his kids couldn't come with him on a trip to hawaii and he invited

58:40.240 --> 58:53.920
my wife and i oh what oh did he now hold on huh the only like little thing was i would have just

58:53.920 --> 59:04.720
sorry there's just one you just had one thing i got like 11 off the off the dome so this is like

59:04.720 --> 59:11.680
a marine's only resort at hawaii and it would it would cost us it would cost us a hundred dollars

59:11.680 --> 59:20.560
a person should we go okay what i love stop stop stop we'll get around to it we have another

59:20.560 --> 59:31.760
question hello hello hi i'm sarah hi sarah mine's not quite that weird okay um so i find myself so i

59:31.760 --> 59:40.080
ask these two people to go to a marine vacation okay go ahead sarah um i find myself in a similar

59:40.080 --> 59:47.520
situation to you in that i work with two of my sisters okay and my question is how do i in the

59:47.520 --> 59:54.960
professional world what's the best way to establish your dominance as alpha sibling like

59:54.960 --> 01:00:04.960

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.440
dye your hair purple oh

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:16.160
doesn't hurt uh i mean you just do the best work

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:33.600
i'm getting in such a situation i could teach you some pretty good jokes about pictures of

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:39.600
peanut butter that you could maybe try it out kind of what i'm bringing to the table okay

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:48.800
uh i think the hawaii one has a siren so much there's like three things that you can do right

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:56.480
now actionable items thank you so much thank you sarah okay we did our best okay here's my

01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:01.200
here's what i want you to break down for me because and i'm going to lay out how i think it

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:07.600
went and you tell me if i'm correct do you want to go with me it's a hundred dollars a person

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:16.080
and we leave in in may are you in i'm serious are you in we leave we leave in may and i come back

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:22.000
in june i mean we all come back in june what did i say what did you say i'm sorry how serious was

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:29.360
this offer it felt pretty serious and he set like a secondary meeting place if we like if i wanted

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:34.160
to follow through he was like the elks have a dinner at the first like the last friday of

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:41.280
every month oh that's where he's gonna get you he's not gonna play in hawaii oh no that would

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:50.320
be cost prohibitive he can get you at the elks lodge i so wait is travel included he didn't say

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:59.120
okay so no no because if he had that to pitch he wouldn't have kept that in his quiver right he

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:05.040
right he would have brought and i'm like and i'll fly you like i at that point i might say yes

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:10.400
do you think maybe he's putting together a music festival like a fire island style a fire fire

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:15.040
fire fire festival kind of thing where it's like listen i'm just trying to get this off the ground

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:18.640
i know young people love music for a hundred dollars you can come to my new festival that

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:24.160
i'm doing with jaw roll that's right jaw rolls back in the game he will not be defeated he's very

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:30.320
sorry uh a hundred dollars is a good price it's a good price for all the what bands are going to

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:45.680
be there the flaming laps the strokes the bottles who's that supposed to be but the beatles why

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:52.720
would that be there because they there's a good band cover band justin ran out of bands he knew

01:02:52.720 --> 01:03:04.640
about jimmy buffet it's good very good uh don't don't got you did you hey wait just to clarify

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:10.800

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:19.200
okay good excellent you made the right call all right balcony heroes let's begin on this side

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:26.640
i'm sorry about the height of the microphone there's yes that's not very nice sorry i mean

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:37.280
i didn't say it i'm sorry so i'm a mortuary student sorry i need a funeral director in training

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:44.640

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:49.200
fallon okay cool i'm sorry that when people mishear you you have to then say the follow-up thing he

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:54.800
just said because that was a very cool thing all right go ahead i can't hear anything anyways okay

01:03:54.800 --> 01:04:00.400
okay uh i have this uh slight problem with when when i'm public speaking or speaking in general

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:07.120
i uh i have vocal fry my voice cracks a lot and uh i'm not sure what i should do if that ever

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:15.120
happens when i'm in the middle of a funeral and i'm oh oh i see yeah so if you'd like to pay your

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:34.400
last respects please come up to the okay side note i can do it on purpose okay okay but i often

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:40.400
do it on accident okay and i don't want them to be like bobcat goldthwait is presenting our fear

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:49.600
yeah i would love to have bobcat goldthwait at mine okay okay found thank you let's hear our

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:58.160
other question hello hello i'm scott i am also a really socially anxious college student i thought

01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:04.400
you're gonna say also a mortuary student in training but i'm a bitter rival of the person across

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:10.720
they get all the good dead bodies all right why don't we get the good dead bodies there's a new

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:19.120
mortuary in town all right so scott all right so i really love like film and music criticism and

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:25.280
all of that stuff and the problem is i love to bring this up and have you know discussions about

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:29.840
hey i thought the editing in this was really interesting and subversive in a lot of cool ways

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:36.720
and most people are like i thought that movie was fine so the question is how do i sell myself

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:40.800
and not end up just making it sound like i hate their movie because i had a lot of thoughts about

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:46.320
it are you talking to like spielberg no you're not talking to them about their movie no that's

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:51.040
a good question other people because i need to make friends and i don't have those you want to

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:56.640
have deeper conversations yeah you want to be friends with stephen spielberg and you want us

01:05:56.640 --> 01:06:02.560
to help you with that no i we could i want to be friends with bobcat goldthwait is the point okay

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:08.240
it all ties together thank you thank you scott for tying that bit back together i mean if you're

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:14.080
looking for a place to go to have more and this will be quick okay more in-depth conversations

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:20.560
about movies and music my experience has been literally go to any non-starbucks coffee shop

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:27.040
and wait about four seconds i yeah i will i will also say right across the street i'm pretty sure

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.960
he's at college and they probably have some kind of like actually it's not even across the street

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:41.440
i think we're technically in it um uh so that but also real quick answer establish yourself

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:46.320
in the group as like the person who knows why a thing is because like i i have friends that

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:50.800
like know about music and i'll hear a song and i'll look at them and say why do i like that oh

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:55.200
it's because the way that this like diminishes and resolves itself is very satisfying and so

01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:59.280
people that i'm like okay great thank you very much and so being a resource for information

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:04.400
like that can like really be useful in a conversation much better to be a resource

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:08.640
than kind of like force that information onto someone else you gotta wait for your opportunity

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:13.120
yes that's a very good point the problem there is you you don't just go up to people like i'm

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:19.280
your resource now open me up i'm an encyclopedia hey you can try it yeah yeah you can try it

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:25.440
what you need to know this let's thank you very much i hope we helped even a little bit god thank

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:33.200
you all right i'm gonna get i'm gonna get real for a second i think well first of all this is

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:39.280
the first time i've and maybe the closest proximity to me dunking on a profession as a goof in an

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:44.640
episode of the podcast and then being confronted by a practitioner of that profession i'm sorry

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:49.680
i made jokes about funeral directors i heard a lot about it the next day it was all fun and

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:53.600
games apparently must not have been a very good goof because nobody here seems to remember that

01:07:53.600 --> 01:08:02.400
i did it so that being said i think something like busting out a nar vocal fry in the middle

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:07.760
of like a funeral speech is actually a pretty great thing because the folks who are there are

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:16.080
very sad and usually usually very sad and whenever something happens that is like a funny memory of

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:20.480
that day during a sad no i'm serious whenever something funny happens during like a very sad

01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:25.520
thing that like breaks the tension of it like best case scenario that's the stuff you remember

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:31.120
from a funeral and so 100 serious like that's a good thing that you're providing a moment of like

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:35.680
levity even though you're the butt of the joke maybe a little bit if it's like a funny memory

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:38.720
that they get to take home then that's a good this is absolutely true because it's the kind of

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:42.880
thing where in the moment it might feel inappropriate but 10 years later is the thing

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:49.680
like hey do you remember yeah i do and like you have a strange kind of fond memory you'll be a

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:53.600
you'll be the most powerful inside joke between these two people who are experiencing the most

01:08:53.600 --> 01:09:00.800
bittersweet moment of their life ever and that sucks for you but it's so good for them i uh to

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:09.040
break our to break our own rule for a moment uh when we were at our um our mom's uh viewing uh

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:14.480
one of our extended relatives came up to us and said i'm so sorry and i without really

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:28.080
thinking about it said we don't blame you and i'm pretty sure i was just being a dick

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:36.720
because i thought i'd earned it there was like that's what i remember the most from that day

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:41.520
and that's good because there's a lot of bummer shit there was somebody who

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:45.600
walked up to me and said your mom's in heaven and she can't wait for you to get there

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:59.760
i think i think i think providing something memorable like that is gonna make is gonna

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:05.280
make the day easier for people and honestly that should be a focus of your profession from now on

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.920
slapstick i'm being a hundred here's your coffee

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:14.720
i was self-imposed i was like oh i'm pieing the face to the brief but like you like

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:22.240
trip and fall and it's just like don't mind me everybody there's probably going to be one out

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:27.440
of a hundred people who are like so disrespectful and the other one would be like they ripped a big

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:43.920
beaver in the middle of it guys guys patch sadoms all right does that help

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:53.920

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:35.240
Hi, we're Lisa.

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:36.240
And Emily.

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:39.240
Why don't you try our podcast, Baby Geniuses?

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:43.240
On each episode of our podcast, we discuss a weird Wikipedia page such as

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:44.240
Flatulence Humor,

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:45.240
Clamato,

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:46.240
Catalan Witches,

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:48.240
Clippy, the Microsoft Office Helper,

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:50.240
Death during Consensual Sex,

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:52.240
and the Talking Mongoose.

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:54.240
We ask each other stupid questions.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:59.240
If you got a packet with like 300 seeds in it,

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:06.240
what kind of plant would you choose the seeds to be?

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:10.240
That felt like you were assigned to ask me a question

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:12.240
and there were certain words you weren't allowed to use.

01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:16.240
We talk about Martha Stewart, her pony, and other celebrity horse news.

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:17.240
Ben Chunch.

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:19.240
Every other week on Maximum Fun.

01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:25.240
Baby Geniuses.
