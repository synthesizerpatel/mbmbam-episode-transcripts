The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:47.040
Hello everybody and welcome to our Brother for Brother mean advice show for the

00:47.040 --> 00:51.680
imaginary. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

00:51.680 --> 00:57.280
I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy. Got a story for you guys.

00:57.280 --> 01:05.040
All right. Does it have spooks and scares or is it more like a jokes and laughs one,

01:05.040 --> 01:09.840
like the funny sermons? You know what's funny? It's got both. Is there any hug and

01:09.840 --> 01:17.920
loving and kissing in it? Yeah, what's it rating MPAA-wise? R. Oh, okay. Some adult content,

01:18.640 --> 01:23.120
but educational adult content. Oh, okay. It's one of those horny,

01:23.120 --> 01:28.720
edutainment movies with spooks and scares. What's the educational nudity? All right.

01:28.720 --> 01:34.480
This will actually, I'll click for you guys when I tell you it's about my upcoming vasectomy.

01:35.040 --> 01:42.320
Oh, so does, you can see how it all kind of tracks, right? Oh my. So just to set the stage,

01:42.320 --> 01:46.800
I did not know. Don't really got to set it more than that. Well, I didn't. This is the first work

01:46.800 --> 01:51.120
here. This is the first sort of vasectomy based conversation that I believe the three of us have

01:51.120 --> 01:57.040
had unless you and Travis are having secret sidebar vasectomy chat. We all share our calendar

01:57.040 --> 02:01.600
and mine has had an appointment labeled vasectomy appointment. You are fucking kidding. We win.

02:02.320 --> 02:09.440
In the calendar, look in the calendar. Yesterday afternoon, blow it up. Justin, I need to know,

02:09.440 --> 02:16.000
do you have any like big plans for the day before your vasectomy? I'll just like some final,

02:16.000 --> 02:21.520
some just bucket list things you want to accomplish. I'll be damned, dude. Yesterday afternoon,

02:21.520 --> 02:26.080
you had a vasectomy appointment, all caps. Oh no, we missed it. I didn't get you a card

02:26.080 --> 02:31.280
or anything. You didn't get me a card or anything. I went to the, I went to get, I got,

02:31.280 --> 02:42.320
gotta get a vasectomy. I'm just crazy about it. I'm crazy about this vasectomy. And it is like,

02:42.320 --> 02:48.880
it, if you're a person with a penis, I think that, you know, it's a pretty, it's like reversible,

02:50.160 --> 02:53.040
unlike, and which is the one negative.

02:55.280 --> 03:00.000
There is a chance you could accidentally reverse it. Like you could pick something up wrong.

03:01.520 --> 03:08.800
There's a lot of, there's a lot of birth control that is less, you know, taxing or more taxing or

03:08.800 --> 03:16.720
whatever. But I just decided vasectomy is the way to go. So I go in, I waited, I would say for like

03:16.720 --> 03:26.960
45 minutes and it was rough because I have no, I mean like I'm not in any way like worried or

03:26.960 --> 03:34.400
nervous or unsure about this, but they were showing a video in the lobby on loop of what it's like to

03:34.400 --> 03:40.320
get a vasectomy. So like some person's balls are just being split open in front of me. Every like

03:40.320 --> 03:45.920
15 minutes, this one clip would pop up. Did it have a little narrator who was just like,

03:45.920 --> 03:51.520
and you're still sure? Yeah. It was like, it's no big deal. You go, we go, just go in and clip

03:51.520 --> 03:57.680
the vas deferens and, and then we get out in and out. Was it the Jurassic park DNA strand?

03:57.680 --> 04:03.040
Who's like, there's going to be less of me kind of popping around. It's pretty close to that. We

04:03.040 --> 04:11.360
got, uh, when I went in, I, uh, there was a, I was so bored. There was like a hearing test kiosk

04:11.360 --> 04:14.640
that I like sat and took a hearing test. So I was waiting for-

04:14.640 --> 04:18.000
Now not during, right? You weren't taking a hearing test during.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.520
No, but I go back-

04:19.520 --> 04:21.520
How'd the hearing test go? Probably not great.

04:21.520 --> 04:27.120
Bad actually. My hearing is just as suspected bad. Um, but I just don't, I feel like I don't

04:27.120 --> 04:32.240
want to go into doctor's offices every week to get something about my broken 30 year old body.

04:32.240 --> 04:37.760
So at this point you've just accepted like, this doesn't work.

04:37.760 --> 04:42.960
It doesn't work. That's life. So I get back there and there's a nurse back there to take my vitals.

04:42.960 --> 04:47.840
And the first thing she says is, so you don't want any more kids?

04:47.840 --> 04:48.720
Wow.

04:48.720 --> 04:52.720
And I was like, um, feels like if you went to buy a car and someone's like,

04:52.720 --> 04:57.440
you sure you want to pay for gas all the time? I think she was just making conversation.

04:57.440 --> 05:02.720
I literally have no idea why she would decided to pitch it this way. And I said, um, yeah,

05:02.720 --> 05:06.160
no, I'm for sure, for sure, for sure, for sure, for sure, for sure, for sure.

05:06.160 --> 05:09.360
You should have said to the nurse that asked you that question. You should have been like,

05:09.360 --> 05:14.560
oh yeah, I totally want more kids. Wait, should I not? Can I not do that?

05:14.560 --> 05:18.720
Wait, I thought this was just sort of an aesthetic choice. You're telling me, wow.

05:19.440 --> 05:23.520
I just want to walk around with my vas deferens hanging out through my scrotum. No big deal.

05:23.520 --> 05:27.360
Now, Justin, were you worried about like a rookie of the year scenario

05:27.360 --> 05:29.200
in which you would have this procedure done?

05:31.440 --> 05:33.760
You would nut super hard every time you did.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.840
It would really amaze Daniel Stern.

05:38.480 --> 05:44.400
Yeah. So she asked me what I did for a living, and that's always a good conversation.

05:44.400 --> 05:47.440
So I tried to muddle my way through that. Oh, by the way, she asked me,

05:47.440 --> 05:52.400
you don't want any more kids? I said, and I didn't even like monitor my tone.

05:52.400 --> 06:00.000
It's just what like belched out of me was, no. She said, why not? I said, got them.

06:01.040 --> 06:03.440
Got kids. Checked off the boxes.

06:03.440 --> 06:07.040
Got them. Got a lot of kids. All good. No more thank you.

06:07.040 --> 06:11.520
I got Boardwalk and Park Place. I'm not going to eat any more Big Macs.

06:12.160 --> 06:18.240
So we, I was, the doctor finally made his way in about an hour after I got there.

06:18.240 --> 06:25.600
And he has me, he said, the first thing he says is like, so what do you do for a living?

06:25.600 --> 06:28.720
And I'm just like trying to explain. It's like, oh God.

06:28.720 --> 06:33.680
I was like, this sounds so stupid, but like, I guess like technically

06:35.760 --> 06:40.160
entertainer, I guess, I don't know. It's like, it's where my brothers and I do podcasts.

06:40.160 --> 06:45.760
And then we just like wrote a, we're like, we just wrote a graphic novel that just came out.

06:45.760 --> 06:50.160
And we do like these live, he cuts me off. He's like, do you lift heavy things?

06:51.280 --> 06:53.280
No, no, I don't. I don't.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.800
You, you've, you're in the career path that you're in so that you explicitly

06:56.800 --> 06:58.720
never have to lift anything heavy.

06:58.720 --> 07:03.360
And that's all he was trying to ascertain. Like dude did not need my fucking LinkedIn.

07:03.360 --> 07:06.480
I thought you were going to say, he was like, wait, are you Taco?

07:06.480 --> 07:08.160
Are you Justin McElroy? Oh my God.

07:09.360 --> 07:11.600
I'm honored to be working on your balls.

07:11.600 --> 07:14.640
What a treat to be working on your balls.

07:14.640 --> 07:22.160
And he, he, uh, he said, um, we can, we can give you, uh, some Valium before.

07:22.960 --> 07:30.240
And the, another option is, um, you can do the gas that'll knock you out for it.

07:30.240 --> 07:31.680
And it's like 80 bucks more.

07:32.480 --> 07:38.000
So I don't know what 80 bucks is worth, but it's that apparently.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.280
So like $80. And I don't know why he knew the amount like right off the top of his head,

07:43.280 --> 07:47.840
but it's like $80 where I want to knock myself out with gas for this ball procedure.

07:48.400 --> 07:51.200
Um, but then he's like, okay, stand up and take off your pants.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.360
I did. I did. I acquiesced.

07:53.920 --> 07:56.160
And you tore away your tear away pants.

07:56.160 --> 07:59.200
Yeah. And I dropped my pants and, um.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.160
Did he say, this is too big, man. I can't, I wouldn't even know where to find

08:02.160 --> 08:03.600
the vas deferens in this thing.

08:03.600 --> 08:08.080
He just grabbed, he just grabbed, grabbed my vas deferens, both of them.

08:08.080 --> 08:10.480
And he, this is not bullshit.

08:10.480 --> 08:12.880
Without looking, it was amazing.

08:12.880 --> 08:21.040
He pinched them and I, and I felt like, oh God, oh boyzy.

08:21.040 --> 08:23.680
And he said, this is, these are his words.

08:23.680 --> 08:24.880
Can you tolerate that?

08:27.200 --> 08:28.000
Wow.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.240
Fuck yeah, I can tolerate it. Look at me.

08:32.160 --> 08:34.240
Some people black out when I do that.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.440
If you can tolerate that.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.640
And he was like, if you tolerate that, we should be good to go.

08:40.640 --> 08:43.440
Some people black out and then, but in the back of my head was thinking,

08:43.440 --> 08:45.920
fuck, if I was one of those people that blacked out, I could save myself $80.

08:46.800 --> 08:49.200
You just pinched my vas deferens.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.440
Also, where's the word of warning?

08:51.440 --> 08:53.360
Like, hey, I'm about to pinch some stuff.

08:53.360 --> 08:55.120
You might black out.

08:55.120 --> 08:59.200
The other word that I didn't get was like, you can pull your pants back up.

08:59.200 --> 09:04.480
Cause we were like a few sort of conversational threads into this discussion

09:04.480 --> 09:08.320
before I was like, can I cover my balls or?

09:08.320 --> 09:10.000
Tell me more about podcasting.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.320
Yeah, is there more we need to address?

09:12.320 --> 09:14.560
So we go, we finished that appointment.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.080
I made my appointment for the thing.

09:16.080 --> 09:19.920
He said, you'll need a driver, which it was a fun, like,

09:19.920 --> 09:22.000
give it a fun sort of heist feel.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.800
The theft of Justin's ability to create.

09:26.800 --> 09:27.920
Call Statham.

09:27.920 --> 09:29.840
I got a guy working on my balls.

09:29.840 --> 09:31.760
You need a no baby driver.

09:31.760 --> 09:44.640
So I'm in the sort of checkout area and I'm getting a date for when I could get my vasectomy.

09:44.640 --> 09:48.400
The doctor at first offered me, how about tomorrow?

09:48.400 --> 09:51.040
And that was a part of me was like, fuck yeah, let's go.

09:54.240 --> 09:58.320
And I told him, it was like, unfortunately, actually that won't work for me

09:58.320 --> 10:01.200
cause I'm gonna have to watch both of my kids all day by myself.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.240
But I'll definitely be ready for a vasectomy after that.

10:04.240 --> 10:09.360
So let's go ahead and we scheduled it out as I'm standing in the checkout area

10:09.360 --> 10:10.480
when they're making my appointment.

10:11.520 --> 10:16.880
And the lady's like, so there's a couple of things you just need to be aware of.

10:19.840 --> 10:23.920
When you come, you're gonna need to bring somebody to drive you

10:24.640 --> 10:28.720
and a valium to take and a jockstrap.

10:28.720 --> 10:32.080
And I'm like, you know I don't have a jockstrap.

10:32.080 --> 10:37.200
And she's like, you can get one in the gift shop and bring it with you.

10:37.200 --> 10:40.240
And she said, you're gonna need to wear a jockstrap.

10:40.240 --> 10:43.600
She said, you're gonna have some swelling for about 48 hours.

10:44.480 --> 10:47.440
Sexual activity will be okay after a week.

10:48.320 --> 10:53.840
And you're gonna need to wear the jockstrap for two weeks to alleviate the discomfort.

10:53.840 --> 10:57.360
I was like, so really the sexual activity will be okay in two weeks?

10:57.360 --> 11:00.000
I'm like, let's go ahead.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.760
And the question of sexual activity will be off the table

11:03.760 --> 11:06.000
as long as the jockstrap is in the equation.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.400
Okay, so we got the jockstrap.

11:08.400 --> 11:11.280
And then the last thing, this is wild, you gotta come back.

11:12.160 --> 11:19.280
She's like, you're gonna need 20 evacuations after you have the surgery.

11:19.280 --> 11:21.120
And then we'll test your sperm count again.

11:21.120 --> 11:28.160
So it could, and then you'll be sort of like clear for, you know, sex without condoms.

11:28.160 --> 11:31.840
But 20 evacuations, so it could be, you know,

11:31.840 --> 11:33.760
three or four months before we're ready to test that.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.760
In my head, I'm like, yeah, it could be.

11:38.160 --> 11:40.640
I was so happy she snuck in three or four months

11:40.640 --> 11:43.040
because I was ready to be like, oh, so just a few.

11:43.040 --> 11:44.080
Oh, never mind.

11:44.080 --> 11:46.800
It's not just like a six pack of Gatorade or whatever.

11:46.800 --> 11:50.720
So do you have a waiting room or is there something comfortable?

11:52.560 --> 11:53.680
20's a tall order.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.440
Jesus Christ.

11:56.160 --> 11:57.120
But this is the worst part.

11:57.840 --> 12:02.960
She's like, at that point, she gets like really vague,

12:02.960 --> 12:07.600
like upsettingly vague about this sample procedure.

12:07.600 --> 12:10.640
And she was like, so you'll just have the cups

12:10.640 --> 12:14.480
and you'll bring in the cups and we'll test them.

12:14.480 --> 12:19.120
And I was like, okay, like, where are the cups coming from?

12:19.120 --> 12:20.160
Oh, we'll have them here.

12:20.720 --> 12:24.080
And she was like, and then you want to take them to the,

12:24.080 --> 12:26.240
oh, let me actually scratch that out in the form.

12:26.240 --> 12:29.840
See, it says you used to take them here and she scratches it out.

12:29.840 --> 12:32.160
She's like, but actually you're going to take them to the lab

12:32.160 --> 12:33.760
and they're actually at this different address.

12:33.760 --> 12:35.840
And she scratches it out and writes something else in.

12:35.840 --> 12:38.080
Then she's like, and their times are different actually,

12:38.080 --> 12:39.920
scratching it out and right back again.

12:39.920 --> 12:44.400
So at this point, like I'm going to bring a cup of juice to somebody

12:44.400 --> 12:49.200
can we please nail down exactly when and where that is happening?

12:49.200 --> 12:51.200
Like, I don't even know where I get the cups.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.440
Like, will you give me the cups here?

12:53.440 --> 12:56.640
I actually asked her like, I don't know how to say this,

12:56.640 --> 13:02.160
but will I prepare the sample at home

13:02.800 --> 13:06.240
or will I prepare the sample here?

13:06.240 --> 13:07.920
That seems like a small question.

13:07.920 --> 13:12.240
It's the biggest difference humanly possible.

13:12.240 --> 13:15.200
The biggest difference, like she said, and it could be,

13:15.200 --> 13:16.240
it doesn't have to be right away,

13:16.240 --> 13:21.200
but it should be within two hours of procuring the sample.

13:21.200 --> 13:26.320
And I'm like, ma'am, I cannot weigh the social ramification.

13:26.320 --> 13:28.320
Please just tell me exactly how many minutes

13:28.320 --> 13:29.600
and I'll do it perfectly.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.920
I don't want to rush, but I don't want to be late.

13:31.920 --> 13:35.760
I want to know the exact method this is happening.

13:35.760 --> 13:37.280
Here you go, still steaming.

13:37.840 --> 13:38.480
Right.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.560
No, you nasty pervert.

13:40.560 --> 13:42.880
The cups, you're supposed to use different cups.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.360
It's only been 10 minutes.

13:45.360 --> 13:46.720
It's way too soon.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.480
You just cranked off.

13:50.480 --> 13:51.600
You just cranked it.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.040
Did you already have your shoes on

13:53.040 --> 13:54.480
and your keys in your other hand?

13:54.480 --> 13:57.040
What are you doing?

13:57.040 --> 13:58.960
We did a temperature scan on this.

13:58.960 --> 14:01.920
You're a dirty pervert.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.840
It's how close you live.

14:03.840 --> 14:06.320
So we have security cameras, okay?

14:06.320 --> 14:07.600
You can't do that.

14:07.600 --> 14:08.960
We did it like the Predator.

14:08.960 --> 14:10.880
This stuff's magma red hot.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.280
Also, you have no sperm.

14:15.280 --> 14:16.320
Congratulations.

14:16.320 --> 14:18.160
But also, also nice.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.800
The cum puzzle has been solved.

14:22.480 --> 14:24.000
I'm now like worried about,

14:24.000 --> 14:26.640
there is going to be a period,

14:26.640 --> 14:29.280
when people talk about the back catalog of the show,

14:29.280 --> 14:31.680
there is going to be a jockstrap period

14:31.680 --> 14:34.880
where I did record wearing a jockstrap for a while.

14:34.880 --> 14:36.480
What if that's your best word?

14:36.480 --> 14:37.520
Maybe that's like, yeah,

14:37.520 --> 14:39.120
then I'll have to keep it on all the time.

14:39.120 --> 14:42.320
It'll get like superstitious about it.

14:43.040 --> 14:44.320
I do see in the calendar now,

14:44.320 --> 14:46.560
your actual vasectomy day,

14:46.560 --> 14:47.920
the day vasectomy will happen.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.360
It's, and I know it is

14:49.360 --> 14:50.880
because I'm not going to say what day it is

14:50.880 --> 14:52.400
because I don't want you to get tweets from people

14:52.400 --> 14:55.440
like congratulating you or checking in on how you're doing.

14:55.440 --> 14:57.440
So just go ahead and start sending those in nonstop

14:57.440 --> 14:58.240
for the next month.

14:59.040 --> 15:00.640
But it does say vasectomy in all caps

15:00.640 --> 15:02.000
with a big exclamation point,

15:02.000 --> 15:03.360
which is one nice,

15:03.360 --> 15:05.360
because it notes just how excited you are

15:05.360 --> 15:06.160
for this procedure.

15:06.160 --> 15:08.960
But it also lets me know that I am going to see you

15:08.960 --> 15:10.480
during the jockstrap period

15:10.480 --> 15:14.320
because my seeing you will be within two weeks of this date.

15:14.320 --> 15:15.600
So I'm, I can't wait.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.760
Oh yeah, within two weeks of this date,

15:17.760 --> 15:19.440
we will be on tour, won't we?

15:19.440 --> 15:20.800
Yeah, we sure will, bud.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.880
I just need a little bit to process the fact

15:22.880 --> 15:24.560
that I'm going to be walking around Disney World

15:24.560 --> 15:25.440
with my balls in my hands.

15:25.440 --> 15:26.080
Oh, no!

15:26.080 --> 15:29.040
You will be at Disney World in a jockstrap.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.480
It's a small world.

15:30.480 --> 15:34.080
It's going to be, oh, rough, rough time.

15:34.080 --> 15:36.720
All right, well, that's going to be a cool trip.

15:36.720 --> 15:38.480
I'm sure I'll be fine by then.

15:38.480 --> 15:41.280
So anyway, that's like my sort of situation.

15:41.280 --> 15:43.440
That's where I'm at in my walk.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.840
Let's move on to the questions, though.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.400
About two weeks ago,

15:48.400 --> 15:51.520
a set of keys was found near a set of mailboxes

15:51.520 --> 15:52.480
in my neighborhood.

15:53.040 --> 15:55.040
Someone hung them on a nearby bulletin board,

15:55.040 --> 15:56.160
but no one has claimed them.

15:56.160 --> 15:58.960
There's a store loyalty card on the key chain,

15:58.960 --> 16:00.960
and I happen to know there's a vulnerability

16:00.960 --> 16:01.920
in the company's website

16:01.920 --> 16:04.800
that would allow me to access their personal information,

16:04.800 --> 16:07.040
including a phone number and email address.

16:07.920 --> 16:10.880
Is it okay to obtain and use that information

16:11.440 --> 16:13.840
to contact them and help them get their keys back?

16:13.840 --> 16:16.800
PS, I reported the vulnerability to the company months ago,

16:16.800 --> 16:18.800
but they don't seem interested in fixing it.

16:18.800 --> 16:21.520
That's from Helpful Hacker in Redacted.

16:21.520 --> 16:22.720
Fuck yeah, I'm in.

16:24.320 --> 16:25.120
I'm doing good.

16:25.120 --> 16:26.240
I'm a white hat.

16:26.240 --> 16:29.200
I'm into the Aldi network database.

16:29.200 --> 16:32.080
I found the sarin gas.

16:32.080 --> 16:34.320
Release sarin gas in all Aldis.

16:34.960 --> 16:37.440
Cancel sarin gas, but I could.

16:37.440 --> 16:39.360
Why do they even have this command?

16:40.000 --> 16:43.440
Piggly Wiggly has just forwarded me 15 Bitcoins

16:43.440 --> 16:45.760
to release sarin gas in all the Aldis.

16:46.320 --> 16:48.320
Is that a lot or not many?

16:48.320 --> 16:49.920
I don't even know if 15 Bitcoin,

16:49.920 --> 16:51.760
is that like 15 cents or $15?

16:52.480 --> 16:53.520
How does that, is it?

16:54.320 --> 16:55.440
How many Bitcoins?

16:55.440 --> 16:57.200
I'm gonna say it's probably about quarter million dollars.

16:57.200 --> 17:00.400
You could do a lot of crimes to me

17:01.040 --> 17:04.720
if it meant I get my keys or wallet back.

17:04.720 --> 17:07.440
If I lose my keys or wallet, not my phone.

17:07.440 --> 17:08.480
Losing my phone is annoying

17:08.480 --> 17:10.160
and it's gonna be kind of expensive,

17:10.160 --> 17:12.400
but like I can spend the money

17:12.400 --> 17:15.600
and get like the insurance coverage on the phone

17:15.600 --> 17:17.760
to do the thing and I'll get the phone back.

17:17.760 --> 17:19.840
But my keys, holy shit.

17:19.840 --> 17:21.920
If I lost my keys, that's my month

17:21.920 --> 17:25.840
is just getting reassembling the fellowship

17:25.840 --> 17:28.800
of the key ring of just getting,

17:28.800 --> 17:30.320
like I would have to first remember

17:30.320 --> 17:32.000
all the keys I have on my key ring

17:32.000 --> 17:33.440
and then my wallet, fucking forget about it.

17:33.440 --> 17:34.560
If my wallet disappears,

17:34.560 --> 17:35.920
then I'm just gonna like start over,

17:35.920 --> 17:38.160
change my identity, you know?

17:38.160 --> 17:39.360
Cause it's, there's no point.

17:39.360 --> 17:40.080
There's no point.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.080
I could not tell you the cards that are in there.

17:42.080 --> 17:43.440
So like I would let you,

17:43.440 --> 17:47.600
I wouldn't mind you hacking the Aldi website

17:47.600 --> 17:50.400
to get my info if it meant reuniting me.

17:50.400 --> 17:51.760
Here's what I'm more worried about.

17:51.760 --> 17:53.360
I would also love to have my keys back

17:53.360 --> 17:54.880
though I only have three keys,

17:54.880 --> 17:58.160
but I do have a really great like Tardis key chain on there

17:58.160 --> 18:00.560
that I love and I wouldn't know where to get a replacement.

18:00.560 --> 18:02.000
Yeah, it's like one of those like,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.080
it's shaped like a hotel room, you know,

18:04.080 --> 18:05.920
like diamonds and it's like information

18:05.920 --> 18:07.040
about the Tardis and stuff.

18:07.040 --> 18:08.720
But it's not, it's not three-dimensional.

18:08.720 --> 18:09.680
It's not a three-dimensional.

18:09.680 --> 18:10.880
It's a flat key.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.880
That's what I thought is that you had a phone box

18:12.880 --> 18:13.760
in your pocket, okay.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.680
No, but what I'd be worried about

18:15.680 --> 18:17.600
is the information that you could access here

18:17.600 --> 18:19.840
of like Travis went to the grocery store

18:19.840 --> 18:21.840
and like had a week where he really thought

18:21.840 --> 18:23.760
he was gonna get into fancy cheeses

18:23.760 --> 18:25.600
and bought too much cheese one weekend.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.400
Like that's information I don't want you to have about me.

18:28.960 --> 18:32.640
I'm also disappointed in whatever grocery store chain

18:32.640 --> 18:34.400
this is that you reached out to them

18:34.400 --> 18:36.160
and was like, hey, there's a backdoor

18:36.160 --> 18:37.920
and they're like, well, okay, whatever.

18:37.920 --> 18:38.480
It happens.

18:38.480 --> 18:41.440
Oh, I mean, literally nobody gives a shit.

18:41.440 --> 18:42.720
I think go ahead and hack them.

18:43.760 --> 18:44.720
And I don't usually say that.

18:44.720 --> 18:46.720
I usually think that the hack is not good.

18:46.720 --> 18:47.760
Here's the thing though.

18:48.320 --> 18:49.600
It's been two weeks.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.480
So my point being is like this person's probably

18:52.480 --> 18:55.120
already working on like rebuilding their key chain.

18:55.680 --> 18:57.280
They might even be like done.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.800
And now like two or three weeks later,

19:00.800 --> 19:03.120
you're like, here they are.

19:03.680 --> 19:06.320
Like they've just gotten over the fact

19:06.320 --> 19:08.640
that they've lost and replaced these keys.

19:08.640 --> 19:09.840
Can you imagine?

19:10.480 --> 19:12.720
I was thinking when Griff was talking about

19:12.720 --> 19:17.040
how sort of terrible this would be for his keys and wallet.

19:17.040 --> 19:19.440
Like it would be unfathomably annoying.

19:19.440 --> 19:22.400
Like no argument there.

19:22.400 --> 19:26.480
Can you imagine if this could happen for internet?

19:27.680 --> 19:30.400
Can you imagine how kind of like

19:31.280 --> 19:33.280
if just one day you woke up and you're like,

19:34.160 --> 19:37.360
I can't do it at all.

19:37.920 --> 19:38.640
I can't.

19:38.640 --> 19:39.440
Like you can't.

19:39.440 --> 19:40.720
Hold on, Justin, just to follow up.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.000
It's all internet.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.320
I can't internet.

19:44.320 --> 19:47.600
And all my internet is gone from me, right?

19:47.600 --> 19:49.680
I can't get to it, but it is gone.

19:49.680 --> 19:52.240
Like it's not gonna, not like some weird hacker is like,

19:52.240 --> 19:53.920
it's gone.

19:53.920 --> 19:58.000
Like your internet is like a physical thing in the world

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
and you just can't get into it.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.920
So you can't check your sites?

20:01.920 --> 20:03.520
Can't check your sites.

20:03.520 --> 20:04.880
I could do this now, right?

20:04.880 --> 20:06.400
Just log off, go to a cabin.

20:07.520 --> 20:09.360
But what if people start talking shit?

20:10.320 --> 20:11.360
Oh, okay.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.080
What if people are asking questions about your vasectomy

20:14.080 --> 20:15.520
and you can't be there to answer them?

20:15.520 --> 20:16.960
Yes, I won't be there to answer them.

20:16.960 --> 20:19.040
So I can't do that.

20:19.040 --> 20:20.800
It's like, I don't know what the,

20:20.800 --> 20:22.960
I'm having trouble sort of like conceiving this.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.080
I was just thinking about how like,

20:24.640 --> 20:25.760
it would be really nice,

20:25.760 --> 20:27.760
it would be almost kind of nice with a wallet

20:27.760 --> 20:30.000
cause there's like, you get a lot of cruft

20:30.000 --> 20:32.080
and it's like, okay, well I just need like,

20:32.080 --> 20:33.920
all I need is like a license and a card.

20:33.920 --> 20:36.240
And like after that, I'm just, I don't care.

20:36.240 --> 20:38.160
I'll figure out the AAA's phone number.

20:38.160 --> 20:40.960
Like if I need to contact them, whatever, no problem.

20:40.960 --> 20:42.160
I do have a lot of junk in my wallet.

20:42.160 --> 20:43.280
It's just a lot of junk.

20:43.280 --> 20:46.000
And I just kind of wish you could do that with like internet

20:46.000 --> 20:48.080
where like, I just need this email address.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.120
Just empty it out?

20:49.120 --> 20:50.640
What if I just emptied out my internet?

20:50.640 --> 20:51.440
Fuck yes.

20:52.480 --> 20:52.880
Okay.

20:53.440 --> 20:56.720
I've got a fucking lick ice cream frequent,

20:56.720 --> 20:59.120
ice cream buyer card that's all the way punched out.

20:59.120 --> 21:00.000
Hell yeah.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
I get a free fucking pint of ice cream.

21:02.000 --> 21:02.720
Are you kidding me?

21:03.280 --> 21:04.640
What else is in here?

21:04.640 --> 21:05.680
What's in my wallet?

21:05.680 --> 21:06.480
Let me see.

21:06.480 --> 21:08.240
Anybody, hey, this is a funny, hold on, wait.

21:08.240 --> 21:09.600
This can be like a funny bit.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.440
Anybody got, anybody got a Jimmy cap?

21:13.280 --> 21:15.760
Anybody got a, anybody got a rubber?

21:15.760 --> 21:20.400
Ah, no.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.360
Yeah, I don't either.

21:21.360 --> 21:21.760
All right.

21:21.760 --> 21:22.480
Here's a Yahoo.

21:23.280 --> 21:25.280
This one was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

21:25.280 --> 21:25.920
Thank you, Adrian.

21:25.920 --> 21:27.120
It's Yahoo Answers user.

21:27.680 --> 21:28.640
They're anonymous.

21:28.640 --> 21:30.480
I'll call them Cody asks.

21:31.840 --> 21:34.800
Well, people think I'm tough if I talk through clenched teeth

21:34.800 --> 21:36.080
and wear sunglasses.

21:38.720 --> 21:42.480
They might think you have to go to the bathroom really bad.

21:42.480 --> 21:43.920
I don't know, Trav.

21:43.920 --> 21:45.360
I think it could be pretty bad ass.

21:45.360 --> 21:47.280
I think you could sound like a real tough, okay.

21:48.480 --> 21:52.960
Can you show me which way it is to the rallies?

21:55.120 --> 21:58.160
Do you know, see, that sounds, Griffin, like you need to shit.

21:58.160 --> 22:00.000
Or you're angry at rallies.

22:00.000 --> 22:00.640
Let me try.

22:01.440 --> 22:04.320
Where's the closest rallies?

22:04.960 --> 22:10.640
If you sound like a representation of like a physical manifestation of anger,

22:11.200 --> 22:13.760
like the Lewis Black character in Inside Out,

22:13.760 --> 22:17.600
is that tough or are you just kind of fussy?

22:17.600 --> 22:20.960
Is there a way to talk through clenched teeth and not sound angry?

22:21.680 --> 22:24.400
Like if you were like, oh, I love rallies.

22:25.120 --> 22:27.120
No, that still sounds like you're pretty pissed off.

22:27.760 --> 22:28.480
Okay, let me try again.

22:28.480 --> 22:29.360
Let me try again.

22:29.360 --> 22:31.680
I love rallies.

22:32.640 --> 22:35.040
I don't know how to diagnose that one, Trav.

22:35.040 --> 22:35.920
Okay, okay.

22:36.640 --> 22:37.760
Can it be inspirational?

22:38.960 --> 22:39.760
Like what?

22:39.760 --> 22:44.720
It always seems impossible until it's done, Nelson Mandela.

22:45.680 --> 22:50.400
That kind of sounded a little bit like the Joker and Batman had a raspy voiced baby.

22:50.400 --> 22:53.200
Yeah, but I do appreciate the quote.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.880
I found it uplifting.

22:54.880 --> 22:58.320
Was that somebody speaking to Nelson Mandela or did you include that?

23:00.320 --> 23:02.000
Hey, Nelson Mandela.

23:02.000 --> 23:02.800
It was both.

23:02.800 --> 23:05.840
It was someone quoting Nelson Mandela to Nelson Mandela.

23:05.840 --> 23:08.320
So Nelson Mandelbeck, okay, you got me.

23:08.320 --> 23:12.480
And Nelson Mandela thinking, wow, I'm uplifted and that person's tough.

23:12.480 --> 23:14.080
Yeah, that's a very tough version.

23:14.080 --> 23:14.880
I'll say this.

23:14.880 --> 23:18.480
The sunglasses are going to go a long fucking way to looking tough.

23:19.120 --> 23:22.400
Let me offer a similar but different option.

23:22.400 --> 23:25.280
Sunglasses and your teeth never touch.

23:26.160 --> 23:28.560
So you say like, let's go to the rallies.

23:29.120 --> 23:31.920
Has anybody seen my Bible?

23:31.920 --> 23:36.640
Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, and today is a gift.

23:36.640 --> 23:38.880
That's why they call it the present.

23:39.920 --> 23:41.440
Nelson Mandela.

23:41.440 --> 23:42.960
Actually, Kung Fu Panda.

23:43.760 --> 23:44.160
Okay.

23:44.160 --> 23:48.240
I found a page of 10 life changing Kung Fu Panda insurational quotes.

23:48.240 --> 23:48.720
Ah, cool.

23:48.720 --> 23:51.600
Let's figure out which one is the toughest.

23:54.400 --> 23:57.600
Which one of these KFP quotes can Justin make sound the most hard ass?

23:58.240 --> 23:58.560
Okay.

23:59.360 --> 24:00.800
That was Master Oogway, of course.

24:01.520 --> 24:04.560
Your story may not have such a happy beginning,

24:04.560 --> 24:06.880
but that does not make you who you are.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.280
It is the rest of it.

24:09.280 --> 24:11.200
Who you choose to be.

24:12.000 --> 24:12.480
It's from the Seasayer.

24:12.480 --> 24:14.080
Not exactly pithy.

24:14.080 --> 24:15.440
No, it's a little wordy.

24:16.800 --> 24:17.520
Do you have sunglasses?

24:17.520 --> 24:18.320
Do you have sunglasses?

24:19.200 --> 24:19.440
Yeah.

24:20.240 --> 24:21.520
I know you have your fucking Gunnars,

24:21.520 --> 24:25.120
but those have never made anybody look tough ever in the history of time.

24:25.120 --> 24:26.080
Okay, here we go.

24:26.080 --> 24:27.520
I got my sunglasses on now.

24:27.520 --> 24:28.960
Tap them so I can hear it.

24:28.960 --> 24:30.400
Yeah, tap them against the mic.

24:30.400 --> 24:30.960
Okay.

24:30.960 --> 24:32.000
He could be tapping anything.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.840
I believe him. Master Oogway says,

24:35.440 --> 24:37.520
There are no accidents.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.920
Okay, wait.

24:39.920 --> 24:41.360
Shit, no, that was bad.

24:41.360 --> 24:44.000
That was fucking hard ass, dude.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.280
There are some, though.

24:45.280 --> 24:45.760
That one's just-

24:45.760 --> 24:47.120
But there are accidents.

24:47.120 --> 24:48.320
There are accidents.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.480
If I knock over my cup and I'm like,

24:50.480 --> 24:51.920
oh, I'm so sorry, and you're like,

24:51.920 --> 24:52.960
there are no accidents.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.040
There was an answer on this,

24:55.040 --> 24:56.800
and it's from an anonymous user who says,

24:57.680 --> 24:59.520
do you have a jaw issue?

24:59.520 --> 25:00.640
And then follows that up with,

25:00.640 --> 25:02.720
sunglasses are way fucking tough.

25:03.280 --> 25:04.640
Yeah, for sure.

25:04.640 --> 25:08.160
Me and my family like to go out and eat every weekend.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.880
And one of our favorite places to visit

25:10.880 --> 25:13.040
is a local Mexican food restaurant,

25:13.040 --> 25:15.120
but recently we've been avoiding the restaurant

25:15.120 --> 25:17.520
since one of the staff there keeps asking us riddles

25:17.520 --> 25:18.320
while we order.

25:18.320 --> 25:19.600
Oh my God in heaven.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.600
He won't even ask us if we want to hear them anymore.

25:21.600 --> 25:24.400
He just starts asking us riddles until we've lost our appetite.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.640
There was even an instance where the whole night

25:28.640 --> 25:30.960
he just kept trying to get us to invest in Bitcoin.

25:30.960 --> 25:32.080
And that's not a riddle.

25:32.080 --> 25:33.280
That's different.

25:33.280 --> 25:35.040
Well, is it a riddle, Justin?

25:35.040 --> 25:36.560
How does Bitcoin work?

25:36.560 --> 25:39.280
I love this restaurant since it has amazing burritos,

25:39.280 --> 25:41.440
but this guy repels us from going back.

25:41.440 --> 25:44.160
How should I confront this burrito riddler

25:44.160 --> 25:46.560
so that I can enjoy a nice meal

25:46.560 --> 25:48.240
without being forced to listen to his musings?

25:48.240 --> 25:49.280
That's from Gmail.

25:51.920 --> 25:52.720
I just-

25:52.720 --> 25:57.200
If meat and cheese wrapped up by bring to thee,

25:57.200 --> 26:01.440
you must answer me, visa riddles three.

26:01.440 --> 26:06.960
It's just, are the riddles Mexican food based

26:07.680 --> 26:10.320
or are they just anything goes?

26:11.920 --> 26:13.280
Okay, what do you guys think about this?

26:13.280 --> 26:17.120
I just read these on Reddit about riddles.

26:17.120 --> 26:18.560
Oh, what was it?

26:18.560 --> 26:22.000
So there's like a guy and it's a puddle of the food.

26:22.000 --> 26:22.800
Oh, what was that?

26:22.800 --> 26:26.240
Well, like how does he just have these riddles ready to go?

26:26.240 --> 26:27.600
Is he reading them from a book?

26:28.560 --> 26:29.520
What's he steal?

26:30.960 --> 26:33.840
And why does he want you to invest in Bitcoin?

26:33.840 --> 26:35.440
I just don't see...

26:38.080 --> 26:39.120
It just makes me...

26:43.520 --> 26:46.800
I don't want to do a riddle then, but sometimes I do.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.240
And that's the problem with riddles

26:48.240 --> 26:51.040
is you can never get a nice brain tickler

26:51.680 --> 26:53.440
when you need one.

26:53.440 --> 26:54.640
And I don't really want to do that

26:54.640 --> 26:55.920
when I'm trying to eat Mexican food.

26:55.920 --> 27:01.280
Where is this guy when I'm on a long car trip with my wife?

27:01.280 --> 27:07.200
Because then we can really use a nice little cerebral diversion

27:07.200 --> 27:09.840
to sort of ponder over.

27:09.840 --> 27:12.320
Especially when it's time to order,

27:12.320 --> 27:13.680
which I think we can all agree,

27:13.680 --> 27:16.560
no matter how confident you are in what meal you want,

27:16.560 --> 27:17.760
as soon as someone asks you,

27:17.760 --> 27:20.240
it becomes like the most high stress,

27:20.960 --> 27:23.920
like, oh, please let me go last.

27:23.920 --> 27:27.280
Like, why would that be the time to ask me some riddles?

27:27.280 --> 27:30.960
I'm barely keeping it together, ordering from you.

27:32.880 --> 27:34.960
I googled taco riddles

27:34.960 --> 27:37.040
because I did want to have one where you could like...

27:38.560 --> 27:40.000
My grand plan was,

27:40.960 --> 27:44.080
what if you twisted it back on him with a taco riddle?

27:44.080 --> 27:48.320
And like that would really knock him for a loop.

27:48.320 --> 27:54.560
And I found an online riddle database that's crowdsourced.

27:54.560 --> 27:57.200
So the quality of the riddles,

27:57.200 --> 27:58.800
specifically the one I found,

27:58.800 --> 28:00.800
and then as I continue to peruse the site,

28:01.760 --> 28:05.760
all on this site is questionable.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.360
So I don't have...

28:07.360 --> 28:09.440
I wanted you guys to know

28:10.320 --> 28:12.640
that when I don't have anything to add to this,

28:12.640 --> 28:14.720
it's not for lack of trying.

28:14.720 --> 28:16.000
I tried a few things.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.560
I looked and I just couldn't bring home the bacon this time.

28:20.560 --> 28:21.760
Well, hold on, Justin.

28:21.760 --> 28:22.720
Let us hear them.

28:23.120 --> 28:24.640
Don't just assume that.

28:25.200 --> 28:26.960
Hit us with those gems.

28:26.960 --> 28:31.120
Okay, well, here's the one riddle on the internet about tacos.

28:31.120 --> 28:31.840
Riddle.

28:31.840 --> 28:33.680
This is from riddles.com,

28:33.680 --> 28:35.920
which is my new fucking homepage.

28:35.920 --> 28:39.280
I have 10 tacos.

28:39.280 --> 28:41.520
My friend eats three of his.

28:41.520 --> 28:42.880
I eat 11.

28:42.880 --> 28:44.800
How many do I have left by tomorrow?

28:44.800 --> 28:46.480
How many do I have left by tomorrow?

28:46.480 --> 28:47.040
Wait, what?

28:48.480 --> 28:48.800
Okay.

28:50.080 --> 28:52.160
Okay, I got it, I got it, I got it.

28:52.160 --> 28:53.760
I'm gonna read this one more time.

28:53.760 --> 28:55.440
I have 10 tacos.

28:55.440 --> 28:57.200
My friend eats three of his.

28:57.200 --> 28:57.840
I eat 11.

29:00.240 --> 29:02.880
How many do I have left by tomorrow?

29:02.880 --> 29:04.960
You have negative one taco.

29:04.960 --> 29:05.600
No, I've got it.

29:05.600 --> 29:06.720
No, Travis.

29:06.720 --> 29:13.360
The riddles are all about sort of open-minded way of thinking.

29:13.360 --> 29:16.800
And the answer to this one is the doctor was his mom.

29:16.800 --> 29:20.160
Oh, they don't bury alive tacos.

29:20.160 --> 29:23.760
They all fuse into a piece of feces in my toilet.

29:23.760 --> 29:24.160
Yum.

29:24.800 --> 29:25.040
That's the answer.

29:25.040 --> 29:27.600
Holy shit, doctor.

29:27.600 --> 29:28.320
Just saying.

29:29.040 --> 29:30.800
Hey guys, here's another riddle.

29:31.360 --> 29:33.920
What do ghosts eat for breakfast?

29:37.120 --> 29:38.960
Cereal with boo-berries?

29:38.960 --> 29:39.200
No.

29:40.640 --> 29:40.880
No.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.680
No, blueberry pancakes.

29:43.680 --> 29:44.720
Invisible eggs.

29:47.040 --> 29:47.920
Dreaded wheat.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.760
Fucking hell, man.

29:52.400 --> 29:53.120
Damn, dude.

29:53.840 --> 29:58.800
Great riddles that get frazzled out through the ages are very challenging.

29:58.800 --> 30:04.640
And riddles.com is where people can come and just sort of do whatever.

30:04.640 --> 30:07.200
Just sort of play around and explore the space.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.960
I'm deep in the guts of this website right now.

30:08.960 --> 30:09.760
Here's one.

30:09.760 --> 30:11.440
Oh, I got one for you.

30:11.440 --> 30:14.800
I'm neither liquid nor solid or gas.

30:15.520 --> 30:19.760
I'm used to create famous things, but I do not get any fame.

30:20.480 --> 30:25.920
If you merge solid and liquid, you will find the other part of who I am.

30:26.720 --> 30:27.440
What am I?

30:30.000 --> 30:30.480
What?

30:30.480 --> 30:31.360
I am paint.

30:32.560 --> 30:34.480
Hey, paint's liquid.

30:35.280 --> 30:36.640
Hey, what are you doing?

30:36.640 --> 30:39.520
What are you doing?

30:39.520 --> 30:40.560
You're not.

30:40.560 --> 30:41.840
You're not paint.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.440
What are you doing?

30:43.440 --> 30:48.000
I am not water or soda or beer or wine,

30:48.000 --> 30:52.560
but I am a wet liquid that you drink and I'm not milk.

30:52.560 --> 30:53.280
What am I?

30:54.240 --> 30:55.120
I'm water.

30:56.320 --> 30:59.040
But a different kind of water than what you were thinking of.

31:00.480 --> 31:01.440
That's a good riddle.

31:01.440 --> 31:02.720
Damn, could this be?

31:02.720 --> 31:04.240
Advice is played.

31:04.240 --> 31:06.560
Can we all agree that advice is played?

31:06.560 --> 31:08.080
Riddles are where it's at.

31:08.080 --> 31:08.640
That's where it's at.

31:08.640 --> 31:14.160
Okay, you can carry it everywhere you go and it does not get heavy.

31:14.800 --> 31:15.600
What is it?

31:17.120 --> 31:18.000
I don't know what.

31:19.120 --> 31:23.280
Okay, one, we can spend the next 45 minutes listing things

31:23.280 --> 31:25.040
that fit that clarification.

31:25.040 --> 31:27.040
The answer is your name.

31:27.040 --> 31:30.560
Okay, but like also a light bag, a balloon.

31:31.680 --> 31:34.800
Like there are lots of things, a grain of sand.

31:34.800 --> 31:37.600
Hey, guys, I'm big as an elephant, but lighter than a feather.

31:37.600 --> 31:38.160
What am I?

31:40.160 --> 31:41.840
You know, the wind.

31:42.720 --> 31:45.200
That wind is as big as an elephant.

31:46.800 --> 31:49.680
This is riddles.com.

31:49.680 --> 31:55.200
This should be like brain teasers.fart, not like riddles.com,

31:55.200 --> 32:00.240
which should be the web address of like the internet's premiere riddle source.

32:00.240 --> 32:04.320
Here's one for you.

32:04.320 --> 32:07.520
Which of these words is the odd one out?

32:08.240 --> 32:12.320
Apple, care, or strawberry?

32:12.880 --> 32:13.360
Care?

32:14.160 --> 32:15.680
The answer is not care.

32:15.680 --> 32:20.720
The answer is strawberry because apple and care end with an E,

32:20.720 --> 32:21.840
but strawberry doesn't.

32:21.840 --> 32:23.840
Okay, but like.

32:23.840 --> 32:27.520
Seriously, you just can't do that.

32:27.520 --> 32:31.920
Just can't do that. That's not how any of it works.

32:33.200 --> 32:34.080
You can't.

32:35.200 --> 32:36.720
You simply can't.

32:36.720 --> 32:37.520
Okay, you ready?

32:37.520 --> 32:38.640
I like this one.

32:38.640 --> 32:41.200
The hand sows, the eye harvests.

32:42.400 --> 32:43.440
That's the riddle?

32:43.440 --> 32:44.160
Yep.

32:44.160 --> 32:47.120
The hand sows, the eye harvests.

32:47.120 --> 32:49.360
I ask again, that's the riddle.

32:49.360 --> 32:49.860
Yep.

32:50.800 --> 32:52.880
Answer, to read and to write.

32:53.440 --> 32:54.960
Okay, we gotta go to Money Zone.

32:54.960 --> 32:55.840
We could do this all day.

32:55.840 --> 32:58.400
This is the dumbest shit I've ever seen.

33:00.640 --> 33:03.280
This is worse than Yahoo Answers and it's riddles.com.

33:03.280 --> 33:05.200
This should be a fucking honored website.

33:05.200 --> 33:08.080
I want to do one more just to like get us into the Money Zone.

33:10.320 --> 33:12.720
Help me solve this, is the name of this one.

33:14.480 --> 33:20.800
Riddle, I have six legs, three eyes, five tails, 20 ears, and half a head.

33:20.800 --> 33:21.440
Who am I?

33:22.400 --> 33:24.080
Answer, I don't know.

33:24.080 --> 33:25.680
Please help me solve this.

33:25.680 --> 33:27.360
Are you kidding me?

33:27.360 --> 33:29.280
Oh, riddles.com.

33:33.280 --> 33:33.780
No.

33:36.880 --> 33:37.440
All right.

33:37.440 --> 33:38.960
Well, the hunt is on.

33:38.960 --> 33:40.880
I've got the beginning of a riddle.

33:42.640 --> 33:44.720
I feel like this is a riddle I've started.

33:47.120 --> 33:50.800
We have a considerable platform here, boys, that we need to use responsibly.

33:50.800 --> 33:52.560
We are now crowdsourcing the hunt.

33:52.560 --> 33:54.160
Give me the numbers again, Juice.

33:54.160 --> 33:54.660
Juice.

33:55.200 --> 33:59.840
I have six legs, three eyes, five tails, 20 ears, and half a head.

33:59.840 --> 34:00.340
Who am I?

34:00.960 --> 34:01.120
Yeah.

34:01.120 --> 34:01.760
So get out there.

34:01.760 --> 34:03.200
Get looking, friends.

34:03.760 --> 34:04.640
Write in your theories.

34:04.640 --> 34:05.360
Work together.

34:05.840 --> 34:07.280
I want to see this on the message boards.

34:07.280 --> 34:07.840
Do your math.

34:07.840 --> 34:11.360
I want to see people helping this person figure this one out.

34:11.360 --> 34:12.560
Oh, my good god.

34:12.560 --> 34:25.600
Oh, I had such a great dinner last night, y'all.

34:25.600 --> 34:32.320
It was meatballs in like a soy glaze over rice and peppers.

34:33.600 --> 34:34.400
Very delicious.

34:34.400 --> 34:35.280
Very quick to make.

34:35.280 --> 34:36.240
Very satisfying.

34:36.240 --> 34:40.080
And the fancy restaurant I got it at was, what was the name of it?

34:40.080 --> 34:40.720
Oh, that's right.

34:40.720 --> 34:41.840
That's right.

34:41.840 --> 34:42.400
My Kitchen.

34:42.400 --> 34:42.900
Whoa.

34:42.900 --> 34:49.440
Believe it or not, it's from Blue Apron, where you're going to get delicious, high-quality

34:49.440 --> 34:55.680
ingredients that you will make into absolutely stunning meals that you will not be able to

34:55.680 --> 34:57.680
believe that you yourself cooked.

34:57.680 --> 35:00.640
If you thought like, hey, I should learn to cook a little bit better or get into some

35:00.640 --> 35:05.840
new recipes or try some new ingredients that maybe you've never messed around with, Blue

35:05.840 --> 35:08.480
Apron is a great way to get started.

35:08.480 --> 35:11.760
They've got chef-designed recipes and exciting partnerships.

35:13.440 --> 35:17.760
Some of the recipes that are going to be coming up in the next few weeks are hidden right

35:17.760 --> 35:20.400
now because they're going to be determined by MasterChef.

35:21.440 --> 35:22.720
That's exciting.

35:22.720 --> 35:26.640
There's even a Bob's Burgers-themed meal coming up soon.

35:26.640 --> 35:27.680
Get out.

35:27.680 --> 35:28.320
Yeah, I'm serious.

35:28.320 --> 35:30.160
So check out this week's menu.

35:30.160 --> 35:35.360
Get your first three meals free at BlueApron.com slash my brother.

35:35.360 --> 35:39.120
That's BlueApron.com slash my brother.

35:39.120 --> 35:41.840
Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.280
Can I tell you about Wink?

35:43.280 --> 35:44.240
Yes.

35:44.240 --> 35:45.280
Wink's real good.

35:45.280 --> 35:49.920
Wink will help you figure out what wine's good and then bring it right to your door.

35:49.920 --> 35:57.920
There's a guy, his name is Todd Winkles, and he will come to your house.

35:57.920 --> 36:03.120
He carries the box, and he sets it down really gently, and a lot of these wine delivery companies,

36:03.120 --> 36:05.440
they won't set the box down gently.

36:05.440 --> 36:10.320
At that point, you don't got nice bottles of wine that have been sort of tailored for

36:10.320 --> 36:11.520
your taste buds.

36:11.520 --> 36:17.360
You got a wet doormat, a wet wine stain doormat.

36:17.360 --> 36:18.960
Wink won't do you like that.

36:18.960 --> 36:20.080
They got online ordering.

36:20.080 --> 36:21.120
They got quick shipping.

36:21.120 --> 36:23.280
They got personalized recommendations.

36:23.280 --> 36:28.480
The only way that Wink can make wine discovery, the act of it, easier is if they drank it

36:28.480 --> 36:29.440
for you.

36:29.440 --> 36:32.320
A lot of other wine delivery companies will do this.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.320
Companies will do that.

36:33.320 --> 36:34.320
They do do that.

36:34.320 --> 36:35.760
They insist on that.

36:35.760 --> 36:38.240
It's always two for you, one for us.

36:38.240 --> 36:40.320
Thanks for buying us this wine, they say.

36:40.320 --> 36:45.200
And Todd Winkles will really want to, and if you invite him in for a glass, he will

36:45.200 --> 36:49.360
appreciate it, but he loves this red stuff and this white stuff sometimes.

36:49.360 --> 36:52.200
It's pink and bubbly, but he won't do it.

36:52.200 --> 36:53.760
He will resist the temptation.

36:53.760 --> 36:59.280
Anyway, it's Wink, W-I-N-C-E, W-I-N-C-E.

36:59.280 --> 37:02.000
It's wince.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.280
What a riddle.

37:03.280 --> 37:06.160
W-I-N-C, this is my riddle.

37:06.160 --> 37:13.800
What is the wrong way to spell a company's name and then not get paid for a commercial.

37:13.800 --> 37:16.000
Wink makes it easy to discover the great wine by-

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
Discover the great wine.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
I don't know what's wrong with me.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
It's the greatest wine.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
I don't know what's wrong with me.

37:20.000 --> 37:26.000
Why am I incapable of reading it and talking it the same?

37:26.000 --> 37:30.040
It's in all of the greats.

37:30.040 --> 37:32.320
What's happening to me?

37:32.320 --> 37:34.360
Jesus Christ.

37:34.360 --> 37:36.200
They match wines to your taste

37:36.200 --> 37:37.800
and ship them right to your door.

37:37.800 --> 37:39.000
They got no membership fees.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.560
You can skip any month, cancel any time.

37:40.560 --> 37:43.440
Anyway, go to trywink.com slash my brother.

37:43.440 --> 37:46.080
You're gonna get $20 off your first shipment.

37:46.080 --> 37:51.080
That's T-R-Y-W-I-N-C.com slash my brother for 20 bucks off.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.320
Trywink.com slash my brother.

37:54.320 --> 37:55.400
Oh, thank God.

37:55.400 --> 37:58.360
I got a message from Jamie to Matt.

37:58.360 --> 38:00.200
Happy anniversary.

38:00.200 --> 38:02.760
Since we have one in August and one in December,

38:02.760 --> 38:04.780
I have a higher chance of getting this message

38:04.780 --> 38:06.060
to you on time.

38:06.060 --> 38:08.020
I'm thrilled that my relentless onslaught

38:08.020 --> 38:10.360
of making you listen to McElroy podcasts worked

38:10.360 --> 38:12.280
and that we can enjoy them together now.

38:12.280 --> 38:16.460
Thanks for 13 years of loves, laughs, and vidya games.

38:16.460 --> 38:19.200
I love you and I like your back.

38:19.200 --> 38:20.400
Nice.

38:20.400 --> 38:21.880
Like your, I like your back.

38:21.880 --> 38:24.240
Oh, I thought you said I like you back, but it's your back.

38:24.240 --> 38:25.240
I said it right.

38:25.240 --> 38:27.160
I can read and talk at the same time.

38:27.160 --> 38:29.960
All right, no need to get like that about it.

38:29.960 --> 38:32.320
Yeah, I enjoy good back.

38:32.320 --> 38:37.120
This is a message for B and it's from your Tom.

38:37.120 --> 38:39.420
Oops, fuck, that's right.

38:39.420 --> 38:44.180
From me to the McElroys to you.

38:44.180 --> 38:47.440
Thanks for showing up to the club fair,

38:47.440 --> 38:49.680
dining to Monster Factory with me,

38:49.680 --> 38:51.840
and all the other more serious and mushy ways

38:51.840 --> 38:55.200
you've changed my life for the better, you electro cutie.

38:55.200 --> 38:56.600
No matter when you hear this,

38:56.600 --> 38:58.640
I know I can't wait to see you.

38:58.640 --> 39:02.380
Ernie and Brian are okay too, I guess.

39:02.380 --> 39:07.380
Was the intro to that message Tom realizing

39:07.760 --> 39:09.960
that they have to actually write something?

39:09.960 --> 39:12.320
Yes, I do think that Tom maybe didn't know

39:12.320 --> 39:16.360
that Tom was gonna get through and Tom just decided

39:16.360 --> 39:20.640
that they were gonna make it up kind of on the spot.

39:20.640 --> 39:21.480
I love that.

39:21.480 --> 39:23.280
You did good, Tom, you did good.

39:23.280 --> 39:26.320
You did prefer for this to pop off around March 2nd,

39:26.320 --> 39:31.000
so we are not accommodating you there on that note,

39:31.000 --> 39:34.640
but still, here we are.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.640
Here's a message for Jonathan Kane.

39:36.640 --> 39:40.840
It's from May, Andrew, Artemis, and Matchy who say,

39:40.840 --> 39:43.440
hey Slippery Boy, thank you so much for existing

39:43.440 --> 39:44.920
and we're so glad we met you.

39:44.920 --> 39:47.400
You and the Kane clan are always in our hearts,

39:47.400 --> 39:48.840
especially Papa Kane.

39:48.840 --> 39:50.620
You're the most special garbage boy

39:50.620 --> 39:52.160
and bigger than life itself.

39:52.160 --> 39:53.620
We love you more than the world.

39:53.620 --> 39:56.280
Keep filling our lives with 69 jokes.

39:56.280 --> 39:59.080
Oh wait, 69 jokes?

39:59.080 --> 40:01.240
Or maybe exactly 69.

40:01.240 --> 40:03.780
You've told us 57 jokes and eight jokes,

40:03.780 --> 40:04.920
we're done with you.

40:06.040 --> 40:09.260
Love the Sin Siblings and the other Ding Dongs

40:09.260 --> 40:11.360
in Underwater Piss Utopia.

40:12.200 --> 40:13.320
So there's a lot of stuff in that one

40:13.320 --> 40:15.640
that I didn't quite understand.

40:15.640 --> 40:17.800
Is this underground wrestling?

40:17.800 --> 40:20.240
Because I've been trying to find a foothold in that world.

40:20.240 --> 40:21.800
I think we might be talking about

40:21.800 --> 40:23.660
some real backyard shit, boys.

40:25.480 --> 40:26.320
Hi, I'm Allie Girtz.

40:26.320 --> 40:27.360
And I'm Julia Prescott

40:27.360 --> 40:29.520
and we're Everything's Coming Up Simpsons.

40:29.520 --> 40:32.320
We are a Simpsons podcast on the Maximum Fun Network

40:32.320 --> 40:34.120
and we've got some exciting news.

40:34.120 --> 40:35.520
Ooh, tell me.

40:35.520 --> 40:38.580
We are going to be doing some live podcast shows

40:38.580 --> 40:40.360
in some of our favorite cities.

40:40.360 --> 40:43.000
We're so excited and we wanna let you guys know

40:43.000 --> 40:44.400
out there in the Max Fun universe

40:44.400 --> 40:46.120
that we are coming to you.

40:46.120 --> 40:47.520
Hell yeah. Hell yeah.

40:47.520 --> 40:48.960
On Saturday, September 15th,

40:48.960 --> 40:51.720
we will be at the North Door in Austin, Texas.

40:51.720 --> 40:52.560
Yee-haw.

40:52.560 --> 40:54.040
On Saturday, December 1st,

40:54.040 --> 40:56.240
we will be at the Alamo Drafthouse,

40:56.240 --> 40:58.280
Sloan's Lake in Denver, Colorado.

40:58.280 --> 40:59.920
There's no basement in the Alamo.

40:59.920 --> 41:00.880
We'll find out.

41:00.880 --> 41:02.440
Friday, December 7th,

41:02.440 --> 41:05.400
we are gonna be at the Vera Project in Seattle, Washington.

41:05.400 --> 41:07.120
Oh God, Nirvana.

41:07.120 --> 41:07.960
Yes. Okay.

41:07.960 --> 41:09.080
And Saturday, December 8th,

41:09.080 --> 41:12.440
we will be at Mississippi Studios in Portland, Oregon.

41:12.440 --> 41:13.600
Hey, Matt Groening lives there.

41:13.600 --> 41:15.240
Yes. Or once lived there.

41:15.240 --> 41:16.900
He still lives there in our hearts.

41:16.900 --> 41:20.500
So make sure that you mark your calendars for those dates

41:20.500 --> 41:22.400
and we will be posting the ticketing links

41:22.400 --> 41:24.600
on our Twitter that is at SimpsonsPod

41:24.600 --> 41:26.080
and we will smell you later.

41:31.940 --> 41:35.520
I have a friend who plays live music in bars

41:35.520 --> 41:37.880
and restaurants as a primary source of income.

41:37.880 --> 41:40.000
He has a great steady gig at a hotel restaurant

41:40.000 --> 41:41.540
except for one tiny problem.

41:41.540 --> 41:43.040
Every time he plays.

41:44.760 --> 41:46.360
Why? Why is this true?

41:46.360 --> 41:48.120
Every time he plays a solo show there,

41:48.120 --> 41:50.920
he is contractually obligated to play Stacy's Mom

41:50.920 --> 41:51.960
by Fountains of Wayne.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.160
Not a joke.

41:54.160 --> 41:55.880
He did not read his contract carefully enough

41:55.880 --> 41:58.120
before signing and now legally,

41:58.120 --> 42:00.040
it's required for him to apply for fictional mom

42:00.040 --> 42:01.680
at least once a week.

42:01.680 --> 42:03.280
Brothers, it's been almost a year of this

42:03.280 --> 42:05.960
and my friend now hates this song more than anything.

42:05.960 --> 42:07.000
Is there anything I can do

42:07.000 --> 42:08.900
to help him get out of this situation?

42:08.900 --> 42:12.040
That's for Sick of Stacy's Mom in Southern Maine,

42:12.040 --> 42:14.800
which actually almost kind of sounds like

42:14.800 --> 42:15.840
Fountains of Wayne. Fountains of Wayne.

42:15.840 --> 42:16.680
Very good.

42:16.680 --> 42:19.040
Let me get something out of the way

42:19.040 --> 42:21.280
before we get into this question.

42:21.280 --> 42:22.880
Fountains of Wayne is a good band,

42:22.880 --> 42:26.960
but I can understand how there are very few songs

42:26.960 --> 42:29.760
that I think you would play them every single time

42:29.760 --> 42:32.860
you played a gig that you would still feel great about.

42:32.860 --> 42:35.440
Now, I bet even Fountains of Wayne,

42:35.440 --> 42:37.240
if they had to do this, would be like,

42:37.240 --> 42:38.080
okay, we feel like we're doing this song.

42:38.080 --> 42:40.480
Hey Travis, do you think maybe in 2003,

42:40.480 --> 42:41.960
you think maybe they might have done that

42:41.960 --> 42:43.200
around that period?

42:43.200 --> 42:44.520
Hey buh buh buh buh boys,

42:44.520 --> 42:47.160
I don't know if Fountains of Wayne is actively touring.

42:47.160 --> 42:48.720
I'm gonna bet Fountains of Wayne

42:48.720 --> 42:49.880
don't get to leave the building

42:49.880 --> 42:51.280
if they don't do Stacy's Mom.

42:51.280 --> 42:52.500
I'm sorry. Yes.

42:52.500 --> 42:53.560
Yeah, they're gonna go ahead

42:53.560 --> 42:56.040
and bang that one out for everybody

42:56.040 --> 42:57.480
every single time they perform.

42:57.480 --> 43:01.160
Of course, they're making like big coin off of that.

43:01.160 --> 43:02.920
Like they, I don't know,

43:02.920 --> 43:05.760
maybe they don't have to do Stacy's Mom every time.

43:05.760 --> 43:09.140
I would think they would probably have a hard time

43:09.140 --> 43:11.080
not doing Stacy's Mom.

43:11.080 --> 43:12.160
Before we talk about anything else,

43:12.160 --> 43:16.640
we need to talk about why this was in a contract,

43:16.640 --> 43:20.360
a legal contract that a lawyer probably helped do.

43:20.360 --> 43:22.200
I have two guesses.

43:22.200 --> 43:26.160
Guess one, that the bar is like called Stacy's.

43:26.160 --> 43:27.400
Okay. Or the owner

43:27.400 --> 43:29.720
or like the bartender's name is Stacy

43:29.720 --> 43:32.040
and it's like a fun thing.

43:32.040 --> 43:37.040
Or two, at their audition for this gig,

43:37.060 --> 43:40.040
this musician friend played Stacy's Mom

43:40.040 --> 43:41.200
and they were like, oh my God,

43:41.200 --> 43:42.880
it's the best, I love that song.

43:42.880 --> 43:45.120
Yes, but you gotta do that every time.

43:45.120 --> 43:46.800
And he was like, okay, you got it.

43:46.800 --> 43:48.920
And then didn't know that it was like,

43:48.920 --> 43:50.560
that was actually in the contract

43:50.560 --> 43:53.300
because that is the song that got them the gig.

43:54.780 --> 43:58.020
Or the bar is owned and operated and themed

43:58.020 --> 43:59.320
after Fountains of Wayne.

43:59.320 --> 44:00.640
That's also- Now we're talking about it.

44:00.640 --> 44:01.880
That's also possible.

44:01.880 --> 44:05.520
Maybe a Fountains of Wayne themed bar.

44:05.520 --> 44:06.880
Soda Fountains of Wayne.

44:06.880 --> 44:08.200
Soda Fountains of Wayne.

44:08.200 --> 44:10.620
There's no alcohol served at this bar.

44:10.620 --> 44:12.280
No, it's a strictly Christian staff.

44:12.280 --> 44:15.120
Straight edge Christian Fountains of Wayne themed bar.

44:18.160 --> 44:19.700
Profoundly unpopular.

44:20.640 --> 44:22.480
Oh, I'm there, I'm there.

44:22.480 --> 44:24.440
And it's just one big,

44:24.440 --> 44:26.960
and it's not a soda fountain in the traditional sense.

44:26.960 --> 44:30.720
It's a literal water feature in the middle of the floor,

44:30.720 --> 44:33.800
but it's sort of a caffeine-free Mountain Dew feature

44:33.800 --> 44:36.000
and all of the teens just come around

44:36.000 --> 44:38.680
and they stick their head over the jets

44:38.680 --> 44:42.240
and get just the blast of that fresh mountain flavor

44:42.240 --> 44:45.640
while they do just dance and just enjoy the night

44:45.640 --> 44:47.260
to the music of Fountains of Wayne.

44:47.260 --> 44:49.360
And it's nice because you can drop your kids off there

44:49.360 --> 44:51.000
and you know it's safe.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.040
Like you know there's no alcohol.

44:53.040 --> 44:57.660
I liked Fountains of Wayne before Stacey's mom happened

44:57.660 --> 45:00.140
and I felt very vindicated.

45:00.140 --> 45:03.440
But then they won Best New Artist Grammy,

45:03.440 --> 45:05.120
which is so baffling to me

45:05.120 --> 45:07.840
because they'd been operating for like a full decade

45:07.840 --> 45:08.920
before that actually happened.

45:08.920 --> 45:09.840
But anyway.

45:09.840 --> 45:11.520
Yeah, Stacey's mom's 15 years old.

45:11.520 --> 45:12.360
That's wild.

45:12.360 --> 45:13.180
That's so wild.

45:13.180 --> 45:14.020
The song is.

45:14.020 --> 45:15.680
The mother in the subject of the song is.

45:15.680 --> 45:19.080
Stacey's mom is in the Guinness Book of Records.

45:19.080 --> 45:22.560
Youngest mom with a teenage kid.

45:22.560 --> 45:25.860
Doesn't make sense her daughter's one year older than her.

45:28.960 --> 45:32.280
Is there some stank you can put on the song Stacey's Mom

45:32.280 --> 45:33.960
to like freshen it up?

45:33.960 --> 45:36.160
Stacey's Mom, A Look Back.

45:36.160 --> 45:38.160
And it's like, you know what, I realize now

45:38.160 --> 45:40.760
that maybe it was just a childhood crush.

45:40.760 --> 45:45.280
I think Griffin is more thinking we take it to the islands

45:45.280 --> 45:46.400
with a reggae cover.

45:46.400 --> 45:47.840
No, that was actually wasn't.

45:47.840 --> 45:48.680
That was the opposite of what I was thinking.

45:48.680 --> 45:51.240
Griffin wants to take it on to the islands.

45:51.240 --> 45:53.280
No, I think that'd be hugely problematic,

45:53.280 --> 45:56.520
but I would, you know, like a nice bossa nova might be okay.

45:56.520 --> 45:59.320
Maybe redo it, but in a minor key.

45:59.320 --> 46:00.160
Oh, that's fun.

46:00.160 --> 46:02.360
Stacey's Mom.

46:02.360 --> 46:05.360
Let me look up the chords.

46:05.360 --> 46:09.720
Or maybe write a song about Stacey's dad.

46:09.720 --> 46:11.040
Have we talked about this before?

46:11.040 --> 46:13.960
Stacey's dad is back from work.

46:13.960 --> 46:18.200
He's doing his best with his ship collection.

46:18.200 --> 46:22.800
Grills a real good steak and can fix the lawnmower.

46:22.800 --> 46:27.020
I know it is a pretty much equal, just normal,

46:27.020 --> 46:30.440
but I think Stacey's dad is a good guy.

46:30.440 --> 46:32.080
He's trying his best.

46:32.080 --> 46:35.960
He doesn't know how to relate to his teenage daughter,

46:35.960 --> 46:37.960
but he's doing his best.

46:37.960 --> 46:40.040
My guitar's open tuned, so I can't play this,

46:40.040 --> 46:41.440
but it's just E-A-B-A.

46:41.440 --> 46:44.320
But so it'd be E minor, A minor, B minor, A minor.

46:44.320 --> 46:45.320
And you could probably do a good-

46:45.320 --> 46:46.160
Why are you open?

46:46.160 --> 46:47.880
Why did you open tune?

46:47.880 --> 46:51.080
You know, I like to get Tinder on it.

46:51.080 --> 46:53.120
Yeah, I think you're just lazy.

46:53.120 --> 46:54.720
You want it to sound good when you're not hitting.

46:54.720 --> 46:55.560
Do you got your guitar?

46:55.560 --> 46:56.380
Do you got your guitar on you?

46:56.380 --> 46:57.240
Yeah.

46:57.240 --> 46:58.340
Give me an E minor.

46:58.340 --> 46:59.180
Okay.

47:01.780 --> 47:03.360
Stacey's- Stacey's-

47:03.360 --> 47:04.400
And then A minor.

47:05.860 --> 47:06.680
A minor?

47:06.680 --> 47:07.860
Is that A minor?

47:07.860 --> 47:08.700
Yeah.

47:08.700 --> 47:11.700
Stacey's mom has got it going on.

47:11.700 --> 47:12.540
B minor.

47:15.620 --> 47:20.620
Stacey, can I come over after school?

47:23.500 --> 47:24.340
Haunting.

47:24.340 --> 47:25.160
You're in the major.

47:25.160 --> 47:26.000
You're in the major.

47:26.000 --> 47:31.000
We can hang around by the pool.

47:39.920 --> 47:44.920
Did your mom get back from her business trip?

47:44.920 --> 47:45.760
You went back to the major.

47:45.760 --> 47:47.380
Listen, I know you want to play the major

47:47.380 --> 47:49.880
because it sounds so good, but it's got to be minor.

47:49.880 --> 47:54.880
Is she there or is she trying to give me the slip?

47:58.320 --> 48:02.040
Why, Stacey's mom has been dead for over 50 years.

48:02.040 --> 48:06.440
Oh, now see the pre- the pre-chorus

48:06.440 --> 48:08.840
is already slightly minor.

48:08.840 --> 48:09.680
Let's just jump to the-

48:09.680 --> 48:10.520
Fuck the pre-chorus.

48:10.520 --> 48:11.340
Get to the chorus.

48:11.340 --> 48:13.440
Oh boy, that used to be.

48:13.440 --> 48:18.440
Stacey's mom has got it going on.

48:18.440 --> 48:23.440
She's all I want and I've waited for so long.

48:24.560 --> 48:29.560
Stacey, can't you see you're just a G7 minor girl for me.

48:31.720 --> 48:33.320
C sharp minor.

48:33.320 --> 48:35.880
I know it might be wrong,

48:35.880 --> 48:40.880
but I'm in love with Stacey's mom.

48:42.360 --> 48:44.400
No, God bless.

48:44.400 --> 48:45.240
Mom.

48:47.520 --> 48:48.760
Yeah, so you do that and it's like

48:48.760 --> 48:50.960
if your parents have you mow the lawn all the time

48:50.960 --> 48:52.800
and you mow the lawn super bad once,

48:52.800 --> 48:54.280
you don't have to mow the lawn anymore.

48:54.280 --> 48:56.320
Justin, I thought you did a great job

48:56.320 --> 48:58.400
at doing a bad job at that song.

48:58.400 --> 49:02.400
The problem is that I was bringing the melody into the mix

49:02.400 --> 49:06.240
because I don't know, I can't transpose that

49:06.240 --> 49:07.600
in my head on the fly.

49:07.600 --> 49:10.280
So I was trying to eyeball what that melody

49:10.280 --> 49:11.120
would look like in a minor key.

49:11.120 --> 49:13.040
No, I know it's a fun song.

49:13.040 --> 49:13.880
I don't blame you.

49:13.880 --> 49:16.960
It's a fun song and what you did to it is a perversion.

49:16.960 --> 49:18.720
And so that was your body reflexively

49:18.720 --> 49:20.920
trying to sing the fun song.

49:20.920 --> 49:22.400
That was like sneezing.

49:22.400 --> 49:24.000
It was like sneezing, Justin.

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
It was just like sneezing.

49:27.000 --> 49:28.440
Folks, thanks so much for listening.

49:28.440 --> 49:30.240
We hope you have enjoyed yourself

49:30.240 --> 49:32.800
aside from the music part there.

49:32.800 --> 49:34.920
Sorry about that.

49:34.920 --> 49:35.920
It was good.

49:35.920 --> 49:38.400
It was good, you did a good, bad job.

49:38.400 --> 49:40.960
You know, I did my best.

49:40.960 --> 49:42.480
We've got some, if you wanna come see us,

49:42.480 --> 49:46.520
we're gonna be out and about this nation of ours.

49:46.520 --> 49:51.520
Trav is gonna be in Newport, Kentucky on August 11th.

49:51.800 --> 49:55.160
Dad and I are gonna be in August 11th at Barbersville.

49:55.160 --> 49:56.920
And then Travis and dad are gonna be

49:56.920 --> 49:59.240
in Lexington on August 18th.

49:59.240 --> 50:03.720
And those are all signings for the Taz graphic novel.

50:03.720 --> 50:06.400
So come on out to those.

50:06.400 --> 50:10.400
You can find the detours at macroshows.com slash tours.

50:10.400 --> 50:13.000
We've also got, and I think there's a few tickets left

for our show in Orlando, August the 31st

50:17.120 --> 50:18.680
at the Walt Disney Theater.

50:18.680 --> 50:20.720
That is also macroshows.com slash tours.

50:20.720 --> 50:22.600
You may be able to get tickets for the Atlanta show

50:22.600 --> 50:25.440
that's on September 1st, but that may also be sold out.

50:25.440 --> 50:28.400
I'm not exactly clear.

50:28.400 --> 50:31.520
But no, there's a few seats for that if you wanna come.

50:31.520 --> 50:33.080
So please come see us at Atlanta.

50:33.080 --> 50:34.160
That's gonna be fun.

50:34.160 --> 50:35.000
It's gonna be a really fun one.

50:35.000 --> 50:36.920
I also think maybe we might,

50:36.920 --> 50:39.240
I would like, I think I might be doing some stuff

50:39.240 --> 50:40.560
at DragonCon that same weekend.

50:40.560 --> 50:41.720
I'll let you know.

50:41.720 --> 50:43.400
But if you are gonna come to those shows,

50:43.400 --> 50:46.360
please send in your Orlando and Atlanta yahoos

50:46.360 --> 50:47.280
and regular questions.

50:47.280 --> 50:49.120
Make sure to put that in the subject line.

50:49.120 --> 50:53.480
Also, PodCon, the fundraiser IndieGoGo for PodCon 2

50:53.480 --> 50:55.600
is going on right now.

50:55.600 --> 50:59.000
Help us fund it so we can have an even better second PodCon,

50:59.000 --> 51:00.680
one of my favorite conventions I've ever done.

51:00.680 --> 51:03.040
And Justin and I helped found,

51:03.040 --> 51:08.040
you can go to bit.ly slash McElroyPodCon 2

51:08.040 --> 51:09.080

51:09.080 --> 51:12.680
And that's a good way to go ahead and get your tickets.

51:12.680 --> 51:15.000
And our graphic novel is on sale.

51:15.000 --> 51:20.000

51:20.240 --> 51:23.640

51:23.640 --> 51:25.160
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

51:25.160 --> 51:26.000
for these for a theme song.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.200
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

51:28.200 --> 51:29.600
It's a very, very good album.

51:29.600 --> 51:34.240
And we're so fortunate that we get to use that song

51:34.240 --> 51:36.640
as our theme and have for many years now.

51:36.640 --> 51:38.680
And thank you to MaxFun for having us on the network.

51:51.600 --> 51:52.720
Oh, one more thing.

51:52.720 --> 51:56.080
Schmaners is coming to the London Podcast Festival,

51:56.080 --> 51:57.760
I believe September 8th.

51:57.760 --> 51:58.840
Whoa.

51:58.840 --> 52:02.080
And we're gonna have a ticket link for that

52:02.080 --> 52:04.720

It was sent in by a Level 9000 Yadru Druid,

52:08.640 --> 52:09.480
Drew Davenport.

52:09.480 --> 52:10.320
Thank you, Drew.

52:10.320 --> 52:12.200
It's Yadru Answers user.

52:12.200 --> 52:15.120
Matt 85.

52:15.120 --> 52:17.800
Matt 85 asks,

52:19.280 --> 52:24.280
have you ever bought a burger from a burger van?

52:24.280 --> 52:36.280
My name is Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy. This has been my brother, my brother and me. Kiss your dad, square on the lips.

52:36.280 --> 52:44.280
Hey, girls, do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna?

53:06.280 --> 53:10.280
Debunking.

53:10.280 --> 53:12.280
Rebunking.
