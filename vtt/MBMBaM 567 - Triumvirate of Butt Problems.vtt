00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.960 --> 00:49.960
It's better it's better

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
It's better it's better

01:00.260 --> 01:02.260
Better it's better

01:09.900 --> 01:16.860
Hello welcome to my brother my brother me an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

01:16.860 --> 01:21.500
I'm your middle is brother big dog Travis woof woof from McElroy

01:22.060 --> 01:25.860
Hello, this is your sweet, baby brother Griffin McElroy

01:26.340 --> 01:33.100
Even though a lot of people like to pretend it isn't the case like my grandpa Dan. This is my job

01:33.100 --> 01:37.680
Yeah, this is my office. You're in my office. This is on my

01:38.180 --> 01:43.420
Courtroom did I record this show last Friday for an audience of our beloved friends?

01:43.420 --> 01:48.540
I did. Yeah, did I record this show again on the following Monday? Yes. Yes

01:48.540 --> 01:54.580
I did my recording it now again on the Friday following that Monday making our

01:55.060 --> 01:57.060
third performance in

01:57.700 --> 02:01.660
Seven days. Yes, but this is my office

02:02.220 --> 02:05.640
This is where I work. I'm sorry to interrupt, but we also

02:06.220 --> 02:12.460
Travis you're interrupting me at work. I know I'm interrupting at work, but we did also do you I guess at our other job

02:12.460 --> 02:17.780
Adventure zone and saw bones and trainers and wonderful. Are those separate jobs or is in the same office?

02:17.780 --> 02:23.300
I'm lost my office to this different offices different offices different jobs. Same

02:23.980 --> 02:27.160
Coliseum, it's just us versus all the other

02:30.340 --> 02:36.300
So, what about when we do business meetings and stuff that's also in the battle area and when we do phone calls

02:37.300 --> 02:39.200
gymnasium

02:39.200 --> 02:42.560
Wait, are we fighting? Are we doing our job battle knives?

02:44.780 --> 02:51.460
Why I'm just my office this is my office was it an office where you do battle it's an office

02:51.460 --> 02:54.380
It's a studio. It's a gymnasium. It's an art. Thank you

02:56.540 --> 02:59.140
Dream scene it's a fucking surfboard

03:00.020 --> 03:06.140
Wait, what? It's a fucking a subway sandwich restaurant. It's a fucking pop-up tent

03:06.140 --> 03:12.940
It's a desk sucks compared to your guys. Yeah, it's a desk. It's my it's my father my mother

03:12.980 --> 03:19.260
It's my it's it's my desk. Why and that's your desk. It's a Coliseum

03:19.260 --> 03:25.860
It's my studio space my work zone. This is everything. This podcast is everything to me

03:25.860 --> 03:27.860
I just want to reinforce that like

03:28.740 --> 03:32.620
We take how to seriously we take this and I got a lot of people

03:32.620 --> 03:36.540
Don't get like they'll just listen to it. And this is just gonna

03:38.100 --> 03:45.340
Beyond but some people listen to this at a faster speed that we recorded it and like I don't want to be the person

03:45.340 --> 03:50.780
It's how you this but I will be it's not sustainable because I can't do them faster

03:51.780 --> 03:59.060
You're gonna you're gonna use them all up. That's not sustainable. I want to reinforce sustainable use of podcast

03:59.060 --> 04:06.220
Yeah, when there's not sustainable usage when you harvest a podcast you have to plant another podcast in its place, right?

04:06.220 --> 04:09.780
Yes, you got a cycle through podcasts, you know what I mean?

04:09.780 --> 04:11.300
Like we've got it

04:11.300 --> 04:16.660
We've stretched this taffy out as far as she'll go if we're not careful

04:16.660 --> 04:19.940
We're gonna we're gonna have a podcast dust bowl people

04:19.940 --> 04:27.180
I've been saying this for years now, but we gotta let some of the fields rest. They're gonna go to dust

04:27.180 --> 04:33.140
they're gonna live it up all the podcast cows are gonna get buried in podcast dirt and

04:33.700 --> 04:36.140
It's gonna be a real problem down in podcast, Oklahoma

04:36.380 --> 04:41.260
And Travis is doing his best by starting a bunch of podcasts and then letting them die

04:41.380 --> 04:46.820
Then burying their corpses in the grounds to let their nutrients enrich the soil for the next podcast

04:46.820 --> 04:53.740
I killed how Lublin seven years ago. The next podcast are the mushrooms that grow on the corpse of Travis is abandoned by

04:53.740 --> 04:58.500
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm doing my best

04:59.380 --> 05:07.060
I even started I started streaming just to use up less podcast resources. You guys are welcome

05:07.580 --> 05:11.900
Thank you for that. Your streams are the compost. Yeah

05:15.620 --> 05:21.260
Television show this is what people don't know is I started streaming and I stopped creating podcasts

05:21.260 --> 05:26.020
But I'm still cancelling podcasts at the same rate. So now I'm creating more

05:26.020 --> 05:33.380
I've cancelled other people's podcasts at this point, you know how your favorite podcast listener at home got cancelled. I did that. You're welcome

05:33.380 --> 05:35.220
Yeah, true

05:35.220 --> 05:41.540
Well, we still got to do this one though. And I do we yes we do because this is our office. Oh, right

05:42.940 --> 05:49.700
Firefighter doesn't go into the office and say I put out three fires this week. I'm done. I'm done with fires people

05:49.700 --> 05:56.020
Still need us, you know, but here's the thing. Hey you guys ever think about if a firefighter goes into work and doesn't do anything

05:56.020 --> 05:58.020
All day, that's a good day

05:58.460 --> 06:03.300
Right, like if I didn't do shit today people like awesome

06:04.220 --> 06:09.340
Congratulations, Jim, but when I do that people are like, where's the podcast Travis? Yeah

06:10.220 --> 06:14.780
Yeah, the work you do is about on par with fire firefighters

06:14.780 --> 06:18.740
Well, I'm not allowed to take an easy day like a firefighter who doesn't get an alarm. You know what I mean?

06:18.740 --> 06:23.940
What's he doing all day or do you think they you think they hit snooze sometimes?

06:24.580 --> 06:29.220
Yeah on the fire a fire alarm because off five more minutes

06:29.220 --> 06:32.140
It depends on how many alarms it is if it's a five alarm fire

06:32.400 --> 06:37.140
They gotta be there, right two or one of you five cute little fire

06:37.140 --> 06:43.140
Oh one is like a somebody dropped like a lit cigarette in the trashcan, but it's outside and the trash cans made of metal

06:43.140 --> 06:47.420
So it's definitely a fire and there's a little figure itself out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, eventually

06:47.420 --> 06:55.060
The trash all burn up and then is that good? We don't know we don't know yet, but it's all stardust, isn't it?

06:55.060 --> 06:57.060
Yeah star stuff, baby

06:57.660 --> 07:04.340
Yeah, okay. This is an advice show. We help people here believe it or not. You're having fun

07:05.140 --> 07:08.060
Just sit there and enjoy it. Just sit here and

07:08.740 --> 07:13.500
Fucking guzzle it. This might be grandpa's last podcast sit there and enjoy it

07:13.500 --> 07:15.500
We're gonna have a good time together as a family

07:15.500 --> 07:21.100
You can go, you know watch a hollow cube on tik-tok after this right now

07:21.100 --> 07:28.700
You're gonna have a media delivered either way God attended at one point zero X or slower

07:29.180 --> 07:31.180
or slower

07:31.180 --> 07:38.260
Favorite to preserve our limited podcast only you can preserve

07:39.500 --> 07:41.500
And you know what stop listening

07:48.180 --> 07:53.540
Yeah, that's we would not to keep making them laugh more pause every time you laugh

07:53.540 --> 08:00.860
And died eight years ago and his brain is in a jar. They won't let it stop podcasting. Well, let him die

08:01.340 --> 08:05.940
You know listen to podcast the way sting would that's what I say, you know

08:05.940 --> 08:12.700
I mean five minutes listen two hours off on a beach. I would stay listen to a podcast because

08:14.700 --> 08:16.700
Probably in a really cool oil

08:16.780 --> 08:20.420
Tantric thing but like he probably has a giant podcasting sweater

08:20.420 --> 08:25.980
He slips on when he's ready to enjoy one and a huge bug that he uses for his podcasting kombucha

08:25.980 --> 08:26.580
Oh see

08:26.580 --> 08:32.860
I was thinking more he would be in some kind of like floating sensory deprivation chamber where the podcast is all around him and he is

08:32.860 --> 08:38.340
In the podcast and the podcast is him and he fully experiences it with every like ounce of his body

08:38.660 --> 08:40.940
One time sting was like, yeah

08:40.940 --> 08:46.740
I like to take my time before I nut and the rest of us lost our fucking minds and painted this picture

08:46.740 --> 08:53.020
I bet you sting. Here's my thing about sting. I bet you he's the most vanilla acid boring dude in the whole world

08:53.020 --> 08:58.620
It's just one time. He said yeah, I like to not nut immediately and we're all like, wow, what a god

09:09.820 --> 09:15.940
Be my sharpest thing. Yeah, I just like to when I'm having sex I don't like to jizz like instantly Wow

09:15.940 --> 09:18.100
Wow, look at this fucking hippie

09:19.500 --> 09:21.500
Hippie dippie doo-doo

09:26.060 --> 09:30.260
Like his name is Gordon Sumner no one ever mentioned it again

09:34.460 --> 09:37.980
I just don't go full at it right away cuz I'm worried about you know

09:37.980 --> 09:44.300
Jizzin too soon, so I take my time in these fields of gold the man can't even release new music

09:44.300 --> 09:48.740
Cuz we were like he certainly waited before he nutted on this one. Yeah

09:51.780 --> 09:57.620
So is that something anyone could do just like start publicly talking about how that they like to wait before they not and get a

09:57.740 --> 10:00.300
Reputation for like tantric shit cuz you really cool

10:00.300 --> 10:00.700
Yeah

10:00.700 --> 10:00.900
Yeah

10:00.900 --> 10:05.580
Is that just a thing like cuz I don't feel like I feel like sting would be like I'm really cool and I wait

10:05.580 --> 10:07.580
Before I nut and everyone went okay

10:07.580 --> 10:14.500
Well, what an awesome no one went fuck used to prove it. Yeah, this is starting to feel like

10:14.860 --> 10:20.540
Tantric advice at this point, please read the I just think I just think it's a you brought the point up

10:20.860 --> 10:24.660
That's the only thing we talked about a more of his thing is that he likes to wait a bit

10:25.580 --> 10:29.980
What else does he do? I've gotten really into sourdough lately. I

10:30.700 --> 10:31.780
Mean, here's the thing

10:31.780 --> 10:38.100
He's doing like duets with shaggy and no one wants to talk about it like in a hundred years

10:38.100 --> 10:44.700
It should be like some popular musical artists of the 1980s and 90s were staying a guy that let's take a second

10:47.100 --> 10:51.260
Music does it you it's lost the time. I honestly don't remember

10:52.220 --> 10:57.580
The only thing we captured was that he liked to take a bit before he nuts

10:58.300 --> 11:00.300
It might just be a breath

11:00.300 --> 11:05.820
We don't right if they let him fit if they had let him finish which is already a challenge

11:05.820 --> 11:08.580
He would have been like, yeah, I'd like to take my time when I have sex

11:08.580 --> 11:11.100
It takes me like seven minutes to do it

11:15.980 --> 11:23.140
It's not bad sting so I'm sorry IMDb said he wrote two episodes of Lucifer that can't be right

11:24.060 --> 11:28.460
Okay, it can't be right sting wrote two episodes of

11:28.460 --> 11:35.860
Lucifer listen it listen was a writer on two episodes of of Lucifer, but that's got to be wrong. I can't be true

11:35.860 --> 11:44.060
Oh, no, sorry. He wrote songs on the soundtrack for this series Lucifer. He did not write two episodes. I was about to say

11:44.180 --> 11:47.460
Okay, my wonderful father-in-law has a trail camera

11:48.260 --> 11:50.460
She has no trail cameras. It's a camera

11:52.220 --> 11:54.220
Automatic camera that takes oh

11:54.220 --> 11:58.900
Yeah trail care. I should have waited for the context clues here that he uses at his house in rural

11:58.900 --> 12:03.760
Virginia to capture photos of the surrounding wildlife between one and four times a week

12:03.760 --> 12:11.260
He will email us photos of deer bears turkeys and coyotes from the camera. Although mostly it's deer. Mm-hmm

12:11.980 --> 12:16.020
I've run out of ways to respond to email photos of these woodland friends

12:16.020 --> 12:19.580
And if we don't respond he texts us and says did you see my photo?

12:19.580 --> 12:25.720
What are some good ways to respond to email photos of a deer? That's from befuddled in Brooklyn. I

12:28.980 --> 12:32.300
Love these beautiful animals. Yeah

12:34.140 --> 12:40.900
But we have deer that come in our front yard literally every day oh, yeah gobble gobble up the jasmine and

12:42.140 --> 12:44.420
It's it doesn't bother me. It's like

12:45.100 --> 12:48.140
I'm sure you guys are getting more out of this than I am

12:48.140 --> 12:51.220
Mm-hmm, but I I have become completely

12:52.460 --> 12:58.380
Inoculated to deer unless I saw one that had big antlers the other day. Oh, yeah, that's the best. That's great

12:58.380 --> 12:59.940
That's I don't know why that's so awesome

12:59.940 --> 13:04.940
I don't know why there's a natural thing when you see a deer that has big antlers where you're like

13:04.940 --> 13:06.660
That's different and awesome

13:06.660 --> 13:11.020
And I don't know how that instinct turns into and I'm gonna kill you because of it

13:11.340 --> 13:16.960
Because of how many antlers you have and how big they are that's so awesome and different. You must die

13:16.960 --> 13:18.320
I'll

13:18.320 --> 13:19.560
Have them. Thank you

13:19.560 --> 13:26.080
There's another end of that spectrum there too when I see a little youngling a tiny deer who's maybe even a little wobbly need

13:26.080 --> 13:31.920
And I'm gonna protect you with my everything and then there's the between deer where I'm just like fuck off

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Get out of the fucking way

13:34.680 --> 13:41.520
Grow antlers the air coming in our yard all the time and every time my dogs go absolutely bananas

13:41.520 --> 13:48.000
But especially my little dog buttercup who weighs about 30 pounds and I know what the fuck you gonna do if I let you out

13:48.000 --> 13:51.520
There right now you're gonna take down that deer buttercup bullshit

13:52.440 --> 13:56.840
sometimes Pete you get too hung up on that you need to create a

13:58.320 --> 14:04.400
Memorable response to something, you know, I sometimes it not everyone has to be gold

14:04.400 --> 14:11.920
Sometimes it could just be like hey nice shot. Yeah cool here cool here. I love it. Love this nice shot. All right, I'm gonna take a

14:12.880 --> 14:16.840
shot in the dark and say your father-in-law might be retired and

14:17.240 --> 14:22.240
Sounds like he enjoys this and he maybe has not processed whether other people enjoy it

14:22.240 --> 14:27.200
So he assumes other people enjoy it at the same level. He enjoys that and simply acknowledging the exchange

14:27.320 --> 14:29.080
He feels like he's giving you something

14:29.080 --> 14:34.560
All you need to do is acknowledge it and say cool deer and that's it help and get on to the gram. Oh

14:37.600 --> 14:41.120
Everybody could appreciate is his great one and all you have to do is like it

14:41.320 --> 14:44.040
All you gotta do is one quick like and then he knows you saw it

14:44.040 --> 14:47.520
You don't got a comment or nothing then you can share with all your friends

14:47.520 --> 14:50.200
You know this great deer this one. This one's a good one everybody

14:50.200 --> 14:56.360
Well, what's more likely is that he won't get a lot of engagement on his deer picks and that's how he finds out

14:56.360 --> 15:01.240
It's like oh fuck. These are actually. Oh wait, these don't have the cool. They don't have a lot of antlers. That's boring

15:01.240 --> 15:05.520
I mean to be fair griffin doesn't sell he's getting a lot of engagement now, right?

15:05.520 --> 15:09.600
But why not have the internet break that to him and have you have to do it?

15:09.600 --> 15:11.600
Maybe you could find some really juggy deers

15:14.440 --> 15:16.440
You fucking dog

15:16.600 --> 15:19.520
He's gonna get some juggy deers and then he's gonna get

15:20.600 --> 15:22.600
What is that even what's that?

15:22.600 --> 15:29.580
Think about it. Yeah, think about it. There's deer that can get it. You know what I mean? The ones that humans like

15:32.600 --> 15:38.880
Does tasty be anybody can like it like a nice chuggy deer people can be at the deers. It's 2021

15:39.120 --> 15:44.080
This stop this was this was acceptable. I think no no no no listen listen listen listen

15:44.480 --> 15:48.520
This was acceptable for like the first two times you guys were talking about it

15:48.520 --> 15:53.680
And then I think for a minute and a half was way too long to talk about it. Well, I'm sorry

15:53.680 --> 15:58.180
We talked about it for seven minutes. I'm assuming they that Rachel trimmed it a little bit

15:58.520 --> 16:03.960
We did about a seven minutes of junky deer material. Yeah, I got it. I got another suggestion. I

16:05.180 --> 16:07.180
Got another suggestion for you

16:08.000 --> 16:15.460
You can after your father-in-law sit. I say his name's Dave after Dave since you picture of a deer

16:15.460 --> 16:21.660
Be like this is great Dave you gotta have some more pictures of deer and then be like, oh, yeah

16:21.660 --> 16:24.580
No problem. And then when you get those pictures, you're like, oh, these are pretty good

16:24.580 --> 16:27.380
But you I gotta get some more great pictures

16:27.380 --> 16:31.900
He just keep asking for more and more and more pictures and so he runs out and he's like

16:32.060 --> 16:36.700
This is getting a little bit irritating. I don't I don't really want to send you it anymore. Oh

16:37.580 --> 16:43.940
So just you're just saying ruin the relationship. No, I'm just saying like if you get real thirsty for deer pigs

16:43.940 --> 16:48.220
Yeah, eventually he will run out of them. You got any pics of the deer's feet

16:48.780 --> 16:50.780
Dave

16:52.420 --> 16:55.000
You got to be more subtle with that they're like, oh cool pic

16:55.000 --> 17:01.300
I love how you got a good shot of the feet there and then sort of slowly guide him like oh nice man feet looking bigger

17:02.140 --> 17:05.800
Just over and over again. Oh, man, there should be a name for a deer feet

17:06.700 --> 17:09.300
You can also ask him to just hold on to them

17:09.300 --> 17:16.900
And so like maybe the last day of the month and then just like let him let him loose and like a huge bodacious wave

17:17.220 --> 17:22.480
Or just like ask him to save them all up and make a coffee table book for you for Christmas

17:24.020 --> 17:30.620
Or a flip book. Yeah put all of them in one thing and it's a flip book. Yeah, shitty not like

17:31.900 --> 17:36.000
Mule linear flip book or it's just like bear turkey bear turkey turkey

17:36.000 --> 17:40.300
Dear dear dear dear dear bear turkey be our dear if you flip it quick enough. It's a crime against God in nature

17:40.900 --> 17:46.100
You know what sucks about this if I get pics of turkeys who cares deers who cares coyotes?

17:46.100 --> 17:49.500
Yeah, who cares but if I get pics of bears, I'm like fucking cool

17:49.500 --> 17:54.020
Look at the size it look at the size of that unit. So you can't shut the hose off

17:54.100 --> 17:56.900
Nope, cuz that will mean no more bear pics

17:56.900 --> 17:57.420
No

17:57.420 --> 18:03.300
This is like this is a wildlife blind bag and you you have to buy it to see if you get a bear in there

18:03.300 --> 18:09.100
Yeah, chase bear. Yeah bear in there. Whoo. Is this a shiny holographic bear? I love it

18:11.740 --> 18:18.020
The the summer months are upon us and it's the things are a little bit different this year and I don't know about you all

18:18.020 --> 18:22.420
But the place I've been most excited to get out to now that we've really cracked this thing

18:22.780 --> 18:27.900
By which I mean coven by which I mean, it's still an issue is the skate park

18:27.900 --> 18:35.180
Okay, and so I did I received I talked to the wizard of the cloud via Maria who sent this

18:35.580 --> 18:39.820
Wikihow article in and it's super important. Does Maria work for the wizard?

18:40.500 --> 18:42.140
Maria is a

18:42.140 --> 18:44.140
Apprentice apprentice. Yes

18:44.860 --> 18:47.140
Basically, so the answer is yes, but unpaid

18:48.220 --> 18:53.340
You're better than that. The wizard of the cloud has so much knowledge and power but is

18:53.340 --> 18:59.420
Just kind of a shitty as a like ethically as a person. Oh, yeah, I guess an entity

18:59.420 --> 19:03.780
I guess the wizard isn't I'm pretty sure you don't get to be a wizard without being kind of shitty. Sure

19:03.780 --> 19:09.820
Yeah, so anyway, this is gonna teach us how to differentiate between a real skater and a poser skater. Oh, thank God. Yeah

19:11.020 --> 19:17.020
Lot of it is watch them skate Wow. Okay, which then we're getting a little bit into

19:17.900 --> 19:22.040
Let's test your let's test your I guess this whole article is about let's test your cred out

19:22.040 --> 19:23.520
But there's ways of doing it

19:23.520 --> 19:28.000
That's not gonna make you look like a huge creep running up on them while they skate and say like do a fucking trick

19:28.000 --> 19:32.200
Do a fucking trick. Let's see it one test their knowledge in a conversation

19:32.720 --> 19:39.640
Ask for bait listen for basic skateboard terms and slang like real skaters are gonna talk real skaters are gonna talk about

19:40.040 --> 19:45.240
Frontside and backside tricks. Yeah, they're gonna use basic skateboard terms like pop and kickflip

19:45.560 --> 19:50.680
Listen for one of the most basic terms of all ollie. Yeah, they won't say things like I

19:50.680 --> 19:55.080
I so I hauled a bunch of perps in the station this weekend. It was a great

19:56.640 --> 20:02.760
They won't say anything like who wants a pepperoni on another pizza pie because that's a pizza restaurant worker

20:03.120 --> 20:06.940
Now Griffin skater will typically talk about Ollie's and kickflips

20:06.940 --> 20:11.620
They won't say things about your driveshaft because that's a car person now Griffin

20:11.620 --> 20:14.560
Are you scared that in doing this article publicly?

20:14.560 --> 20:20.200
What you're really doing is teaching people what other people are looking for out of real skaters and you're right

20:20.200 --> 20:24.960
You're teaching people to pose more effectively. You're right. You could say one of these terms

20:25.920 --> 20:33.640
This first one's I think fake and actually Travis has the uroboros has wrapped all the way around and this article is in fact

20:33.640 --> 20:39.200
A test to see who is a real skater or not because the first term they list here is a slappy

20:39.200 --> 20:44.760
I don't know that kickflip. I've heard a vert. Yes tweak I guess stall sure shifty

20:44.760 --> 20:47.520
Huh kick turn no and mob not real

20:47.520 --> 20:53.400
Some of those are not real slappy is definitely not real when you mess up my trick and your board flips up in the air

20:53.400 --> 20:56.320
And smacks you in the face and you cry a little bit you cry

20:56.520 --> 20:59.160
I mean, that's what that's and you look shifty

20:59.160 --> 21:04.480
But it's a good way to ingratiate yourself to other skaters because skaters are very caring and nurturing a lot

21:04.480 --> 21:07.140
And so when you slap yourself in the face and a single tear rolls down

21:07.140 --> 21:11.240
They'll immediately want to make you feel better and take you out for ice cream and maybe some fries

21:11.240 --> 21:17.400
And then that a better result from this than trying to shame somebody for whether or not they like actually know about skateboarding

21:17.400 --> 21:19.880
Hey, here's a little here's it. Here's a test

21:19.920 --> 21:23.940
Here's a fucking Blade Runner test for how to really catch him in your dragnet

21:24.000 --> 21:28.320
You could try asking something like so have you mastered a kickflip on a vert ramp yet?

21:28.320 --> 21:31.680
Or have you seen Robert do kickflips? He has huge pop

21:35.080 --> 21:38.020
What is this person the article tried to do

21:39.680 --> 21:41.880
Prove whether or not somebody's a real or a

21:41.880 --> 21:46.940
phony fake yeah, we're going to fight void confing some

21:47.480 --> 21:53.420
Void confidence fucking skater poser. Yeah, this article should say watch them skate for five seconds

21:53.420 --> 21:59.240
It's a fall over and cry for a half hour and then have their dad come pick him up

21:59.520 --> 22:05.380
They're probably faking it but they just that even that assumes that if I Travis McElroy write down

22:05.380 --> 22:09.080
I have never skateboarded in my life if I went down to a store and bought one

22:09.080 --> 22:14.000
I don't even know where I would do that and went to a skate park and tried to skate that people would be like

22:14.000 --> 22:17.960
He's trying to pose as a real skater, and I'd be like clearly. I'm not clearly

22:18.000 --> 22:22.240
There's nothing about what I'm doing right now that implies that I think I'm doing a good job

22:22.520 --> 22:26.680
I'm trying to learn and people might yell poser and I'd say no. I'm just beginning

22:26.680 --> 22:29.680
This is a second phase of my lifestyle, and I'm just learning right now

22:30.240 --> 22:32.600
This is a shitty skater is not a poser

22:32.600 --> 22:33.600
Yeah, no no

22:33.600 --> 22:39.720
But if someone is just sitting on the sidelines holding a board that they've clearly scrapped up with a pocketknife or something and they're going

22:39.720 --> 22:44.180
That's a bad jump bounce that you did now that my friends

22:44.440 --> 22:49.520
That's about how lazy is that person that they wouldn't even learn the word kickflip. I know

22:49.960 --> 22:52.940
Where were they gonna learn it Griffin? Yeah, that's fair

22:53.640 --> 22:57.900
You could try asking do you hold your board by the trucks or deck do you think it matters now?

22:57.900 --> 23:03.120
That's that one might actually catch me ask if they ride regular or goofy now listen

23:03.120 --> 23:09.360
A poser is gonna hear this and say well. I don't ride goofy. Oh, I'm a fucking kick-ass skater

23:09.360 --> 23:15.800
I'm a good skater a real serious one. Do you say why do you think max goof would say max goof?

23:16.600 --> 23:17.880
Especially nothing

23:17.880 --> 23:22.200
Movie do you think he would be like I ride goofy or even if he knew what he was talking was like?

23:22.200 --> 23:25.560
I don't want to be like my dad goofy aka George Keefe

23:25.560 --> 23:29.480
We can all agree that max from goofy movie is a fucking poser skater

23:29.480 --> 23:36.200
Wow, hey fuck off. Hey Griffin fuck off. Bart Simpson is a poser. Yeah, sure

23:36.200 --> 23:40.880
I mean like you see him he skates once and then he'll go two years without skating that is yeah

23:40.880 --> 23:44.560
And then they'll see him skate again. It's like okay, so you do you love it?

23:44.560 --> 23:47.480
Do you live for it? Do you live for the grind the daily grind?

23:47.600 --> 23:50.240
Well, he might also just be doing it when he's not on camera

23:51.080 --> 23:53.080
That's possible. Yeah

23:53.080 --> 24:00.680
Ask them about their board ask what material it's made out of do you tighten or loosen your trucks when you get on your board?

24:00.680 --> 24:06.200
What type of arch do you have on your deck? You know real stompers for a person?

24:07.040 --> 24:10.880
Who can't just look at their fucking skateboard and say oh, it's got a

24:12.080 --> 24:14.760
Let's see. It's like some tribal art and

24:15.720 --> 24:21.080
Some fire. Yeah, try the Martian on there. It's pretty good. Yep

24:21.080 --> 24:24.280
Um ask who their favorite skaters and skate brands are

24:24.720 --> 24:32.040
They'll know more pro names than Tony Hawk BAM and Ryan Sheckler. Damn it. I'm out. Damn it. I'm out of them

24:32.720 --> 24:37.220
They will know about a few name brands. Even if it's a negative opinion. It's still knowledge. Ooh

24:37.720 --> 24:41.840
That's a good way around it. Is Stussy one? Stussy, Birdhouse

24:42.920 --> 24:44.400
Girlfriend

24:44.400 --> 24:46.400
Journeys

24:47.040 --> 24:48.600
Liz

24:48.600 --> 24:51.120
Spencers orange Julius

24:53.920 --> 24:55.760
Auntie Anne's

24:55.760 --> 25:00.360
Wham-o wham-o slam-o brand silly skateboard big kicks

25:02.520 --> 25:10.000
Skateboard skate boys skate boys skate men's we can go to the person and just be like hey get this phony Hawk

25:10.240 --> 25:13.000
And if they look at your like arm busted

25:13.000 --> 25:18.720
Then you got them, but look at you like god, that's funny. Hey if they carry their board by the trucks

25:18.720 --> 25:22.640
That's called a mall grab and it's usually considered to be a poser red flag

25:22.640 --> 25:28.980
Let me continue because the next point is there's a lot of controversy about whether or not the mall grab truly indicates your opposer since a lot

25:28.980 --> 25:34.080
Of skaters these days do hold their boards like that. So in conclusive so in

25:34.680 --> 25:36.680
Conclusion this is a bad article

25:36.680 --> 25:44.240
Watch them then there's a whole section as I watch them skate study what they do watch them follow them watch them skate

25:44.240 --> 25:45.880
I just feel like

25:45.880 --> 25:49.080
Should be one right? It should be number one

25:49.080 --> 25:54.120
No, just yeah, cuz someone could be a bad skater and not a poser, right?

25:54.120 --> 25:57.120
Yeah, I'm gonna be a very good skater and be a poser

25:57.480 --> 26:03.680
That's true classic poser moves include just standing around chatting smoking cigarettes

26:03.680 --> 26:07.360
Oh, that's thing and getting old and I'm gonna say vapes in there, too

26:07.360 --> 26:09.760
Oh texting and get only a poser

26:10.040 --> 26:14.080
Even has their vape rig on them at the skate park because they could fall down on it and either

26:14.400 --> 26:21.620
Break the glass on or explode the battery. Yeah, that's why I built mine into my board. I got ohms everywhere

26:21.620 --> 26:23.120
I got ohms all over my pants

26:23.120 --> 26:28.600
I do this thing where I go up in the air off I vert off the kid flip and then I hold the board up

26:28.600 --> 26:31.640
In the air and just rip a big grip right off the end of the board

26:31.640 --> 26:37.200
And then when I come down I let go of a big cloud and I call it puff of the magic wagon

26:39.560 --> 26:46.160
So they've these are getting more intrusive you watch them study them ask them to do tricks they'll say like no

26:46.160 --> 26:48.160
I can't right now. I'm sick and you say oh

26:49.240 --> 26:56.800
Here I'm here. You should be at home. I brought medicine for you. Take the medicine and fucking ollie, but then the next one is

26:57.920 --> 26:59.760
inspect their appearance

26:59.760 --> 27:02.080
Examine them for scrapes and bruises

27:02.520 --> 27:05.600
Yeah, if you skate you're gonna fall off your board and get scraped off

27:05.600 --> 27:10.120
Even if you're good when you're coming up with new tricks, you're gonna fuck you you will I've been skating for years

27:10.120 --> 27:15.160
I don't fall ever. I have never been scraped or scratched while doing my art on the board

27:15.480 --> 27:18.720
Sometimes when I'm skating I will fall into the air

27:19.880 --> 27:24.760
That's how good I am. I look out for name-brand clothing because that means that they're a poser

27:24.960 --> 27:29.360
There's a lot of stuff in here. I'm sure there's good skaters who had just I just bought these shoes

27:29.360 --> 27:31.360
That's why they're not scuffed up fuck off

27:32.040 --> 27:38.120
Phony, oh phony jabroni. No, I just got off work at Orange Julius. That's why my shirt says it

31:37.380 --> 31:39.380
How do you think it's going so far guys?

31:39.980 --> 31:43.100
Overall very very good. Yeah, I would say

31:43.100 --> 31:48.940
Very good the best episode we've ever done one of the top episodes. We've ever done. I have a quick I

31:49.660 --> 31:57.260
Want to this is like a new version of Munch Squad. Okay, where it's just for vegans and vegetarians, okay?

31:57.740 --> 32:02.180

32:35.420 --> 32:39.820
Hi, why I want a Munch Why

32:50.980 --> 32:52.980
Listen this

32:53.900 --> 32:55.900
They're doing

32:55.900 --> 32:57.900
Oh

33:05.060 --> 33:08.020
Vegetarians are just like us and they want to be dirt bags

33:08.820 --> 33:13.340
Sometimes and this will let them simulate be an absolute dirt bags

33:13.660 --> 33:20.180
It's it's really the main thing they miss out on yeah is getting to live like stay up there

33:20.180 --> 33:26.140
They have ways of getting protein and all the strong beef power that I get when I eat a big hamburger

33:26.140 --> 33:30.520
But what they don't usually get is that I feel like shit after I eat most meals

33:30.660 --> 33:34.820
Yeah, listen when vegans get drunk they want to make food mistakes, too

33:34.820 --> 33:41.140
You know yes when they're hungover they want to get rumbly tumbly and it gives them the vegan shits later, too

33:41.140 --> 33:43.140
You know what I mean, so let's do this thing

33:43.340 --> 33:48.900
Yeah, everybody an equal opportunity to make bad life choices the naked chalupa

33:48.900 --> 33:53.900
This is actually called the naked chalupa with a crispy plant-based shell awesome name

33:54.300 --> 34:01.300
Really actual name really described as a new menu innovation that gives vegetarian and veggie curious

34:04.100 --> 34:06.560
I've been looking for a way to get into vegetables

34:06.560 --> 34:14.180
This is just a gateway drug I require a new menu innovation that gives vegetarian and veggie curious fans everywhere reasons to

34:14.180 --> 34:17.060
Celebrate oh

34:18.500 --> 34:21.100
Now hold on wait is that spelled

34:22.180 --> 34:27.580
Sh-e-l-l a break or did it say do a share impression while you say this next part celebrate, okay?

34:28.860 --> 34:30.860
celebrate so it's

34:31.260 --> 34:34.460
You want one no problem because they're everywhere

34:34.460 --> 34:41.100
Oh in the kitchen of the Taco Bell at two two two two Barranca Parkway in Irvine, California

34:41.100 --> 34:48.460
Damn it. You got me kid Justin from now until June 27th fucking Marty McFly go get you one

34:49.340 --> 34:52.900
Why would you get you one? They're everywhere and here for good

34:53.420 --> 34:56.700
As long as you can kill my good time and make it to Irvine

34:58.580 --> 35:00.940
So that is happening there Wendy's

35:02.100 --> 35:03.900
What is it constituted?

35:03.900 --> 35:05.020
What is it?

35:05.020 --> 35:08.180
This is the most sinister thing about it is they don't say what it is

35:08.180 --> 35:12.900
It's just you don't know you probably shouldn't worry about it. No. I'm worried about it

35:12.900 --> 35:18.660
I know what I know about like the impossible burger and seitan and tofu and all that jazz, but

35:19.300 --> 35:22.740
Yeah, they'll never mention this fit this yeah, don't worry about it

35:23.260 --> 35:26.980
They're doing it. They're they're still working with beyond meat to make fake Taco Bell meat

35:26.980 --> 35:30.540
So like this is you don't need this with us. This is not this is never going to be a good concern

35:30.580 --> 35:32.980
You'll never hear about this thing in you'll never see it again

35:32.980 --> 35:36.260
Okay, Wendy's on the other hand is wants to get into the mix with

35:36.260 --> 35:39.740
the in the plant-based category with a

35:41.500 --> 35:43.500
Spicy black bean burger. Oh

35:43.900 --> 35:45.900
Right now man. That's pretty good

35:46.260 --> 35:52.060
but so Aaron Bennett is the manager of culinary production innovation and

35:52.980 --> 35:54.980
her team

35:55.020 --> 36:01.260
Helped create this this spicy new product meant for flexitarians, huh?

36:01.260 --> 36:03.660
I don't know if you guys know about this

36:03.660 --> 36:06.420
this term but flexitarians

36:07.580 --> 36:12.500
According to John Lee the vice president of culinary innovation who describes it as

36:13.100 --> 36:17.900
Not your parents or your grandparents black bean burger

36:18.100 --> 36:25.140
So I mr. Lee I do agree that neither my parents nor my naughty or my grandmother

36:25.380 --> 36:28.860
Barbara Allen would have enjoyed a black bean burger

36:28.860 --> 36:34.420
I can't we are in agreement. Hey, can we not blow past the flexitarian thing?

36:34.420 --> 36:39.220
Is that somebody who sometimes eats vegetables and sometimes he's me because there's another name for that

36:39.220 --> 36:41.840
There's a definitely another name for that. It's omnivore

36:42.460 --> 36:46.780
It's a yeah, it's a it's some of the centers on plat plant foods

36:47.060 --> 36:51.180
But every once in a while you're like a bit of meat, please. That's nothing

36:52.820 --> 36:55.660
Huh, I don't know what you I don't know what you want from me

36:55.660 --> 37:02.740
I'm just here to tell you about the spicy black bean burger. Okay, uh, they explored 70 to 80 different options during the process

37:02.740 --> 37:08.140
Wow, and this is what they came to we have a this is I tell you man fucking John Lee

37:08.740 --> 37:12.100
Who I don't know that we featured on the show before a bunch squad

37:13.340 --> 37:17.780
Which is I should have mentioned earlier. It's a podcast then podcast that profiles lazy crazy brandy

37:19.260 --> 37:20.620
John Lee is bringing it

37:20.620 --> 37:27.820
He says we have a lot of equity and a lot of strength and a lot of understanding in terms of what our customers want

37:27.820 --> 37:32.940
Jesus part of it is flavor. Yeah in the world of paint plant-based protein

37:32.940 --> 37:34.620
Hey, wait, just a lot of stop you real quick

37:34.620 --> 37:40.540
Dustin is there a press release here in which a human person said that we had to study to make sure that our

37:40.700 --> 37:45.100
Customers at a food place wanted to be able to taste the food. Okay

37:45.100 --> 37:48.140
Yeah part listen to John Lee's bringing some fucking heat to you

37:48.140 --> 37:52.260
Now part of it is flavor in the world of plant-based protein

37:52.260 --> 37:57.300
There are a lot of products out there that are just substitutes and they end up getting

37:57.780 --> 37:59.780
built in sandwiches that I call

38:00.420 --> 38:02.180
Okay. Oh

38:02.180 --> 38:03.980
snap, that's

38:03.980 --> 38:10.180
Amazing. They're not flavorful. Yeah, they're bullshit the way Aaron built this

38:11.300 --> 38:13.300
It really is craveable. I

38:13.300 --> 38:19.340
I don't miss eating me. I swear to God on my dad's grave

38:19.340 --> 38:26.980
I swear on the grave of my father John Lee senior. This burger is craveable may Christ

38:29.980 --> 38:33.480
I'll bleed if I'm wrong you you take this knife

38:33.660 --> 38:39.020
You hold in your hand in your other hand taste this burger if I'm wrong on what you stab me directly in the heart

38:39.020 --> 38:45.340
May coven 19 be supplanted by a far more vicious cove in 2022

38:46.140 --> 38:51.620
That wife's humanity for the face the earth, but god damn it. This is craveable

38:51.620 --> 38:59.160
I love this fucking burger and I don't I don't miss eating meat when I eat that spicy black bean

39:00.580 --> 39:05.380
Not even my ex-wife. I love this burger. I don't miss a fucking second of it

39:05.380 --> 39:08.700
It's not just a black bean says John Lee

39:08.700 --> 39:11.760
Okay, it's all the components together that give it the right texture the right flavor

39:12.260 --> 39:18.140
Nutritional profile that we felt good about now. We're focused on taste first. I mean no no no about it

39:18.740 --> 39:20.420
big T

39:20.420 --> 39:23.860
Little in is what I call it. Why what?

39:26.100 --> 39:32.860
No say that again cuz that was wild that was now we're focused on taste first make no doubt about it

39:32.860 --> 39:39.060
Big T. Little in is what I call it big get the taste, right? Make sure it looks fantastic

39:39.860 --> 39:42.060
Nutrition comes second. Oh, okay. Okay

39:43.020 --> 39:44.780
big taste

39:44.780 --> 39:46.780
little nutrition little nutrition

39:52.620 --> 39:56.180
Big taste and a little nutrition. Hey, hey, um

39:56.860 --> 40:00.540
Lee I think you're pushing the wrong thing here. No, no, no

40:00.540 --> 40:04.660
I let him know that it tastes great and it's bad for you. Yeah, that's the yeah

40:04.660 --> 40:08.740
You don't have to say that part. That's what we want you to skip over next time buddy

40:09.260 --> 40:11.820
So all these ingredients, okay beyond the patty

40:12.820 --> 40:18.620
This is like the longest interview of it's an interview on QSR the longest interview I've ever seen about a sandwich

40:19.540 --> 40:24.580
What are the odds that they call them to just get like a quick quote and he would not let them off the phone

40:24.580 --> 40:30.820
Guys, I tell you I fucking hate vegetables fucking hate him hate him, but this is when I eat these

40:30.820 --> 40:35.100
It doesn't make me want to barf like every other time I eat vegetables. I've never felt anything before

40:35.100 --> 40:41.180
I held my own baby in my arms. I look at his face. I love nothing. I took one bite of this burger

40:41.180 --> 40:44.020
I cried for the first time in my life out of happiness

40:46.500 --> 40:50.180
Beyond the patty we wanted to focus is Aaron Bennett again beyond the patty

40:50.180 --> 40:55.740
We want to really focus on having some texture and flavor contrast as I mentioned not wanting to have that mushy

40:56.660 --> 40:57.980
boring

40:57.980 --> 41:01.180
Experience that we see in so many other places. So we added a lot of really nice

41:01.820 --> 41:06.980
Crisp fresh produce. Oh, yeah, like onions and tomatoes and romaine lettuce

41:07.020 --> 41:11.820
Then we have this really cool new ingredient crispy chipotle jalapeno

41:11.980 --> 41:19.020
They're actually jalapenos that are see which is like so weird that you have a specify that era. Yeah

41:19.020 --> 41:21.620
Oh these things these jalapenos

41:21.660 --> 41:29.180
They're actually jalapenos that are seasoned with a chipotle seasoning that perfectly complements the spicy the spicy

41:29.460 --> 41:35.940
Black bean patty itself and we topped with chipotle sauce and then they really come together in addition to nice

41:36.540 --> 41:38.340
Creamy cool

41:38.340 --> 41:45.580
Pepper jack cheese. Hell. Yeah. Hell. Yeah. Wait a minute. Not bland. It's not boring. It's spicy. Is it vegan?

41:45.580 --> 41:47.580
Pepper jack cheese?

41:48.660 --> 41:51.100
It's not bland it's not boring it's spicy

41:51.620 --> 41:58.100
But I like to think of it as an approachable spice where you bite into it and you're like, okay

41:58.100 --> 41:59.700
I can eat this, you know

41:59.700 --> 42:03.340
Like when you're at the bar and you see an attractive person, but they're not too attractive

42:03.340 --> 42:06.020
And you're comfortable walking up and talking to them

42:06.020 --> 42:11.460
But then also if they reject you you're not too sad because they weren't that super attractive to begin with you get it

42:11.500 --> 42:14.220
You get it you look at a person you're like, okay, I could eat them

42:14.220 --> 42:19.940
You get it. Was there a PR rep hovering over his shoulder and he was like, it's so spicy

42:20.020 --> 42:26.860
It'll burn your asshole right off. No, no walk back walk back. Okay, it's a it's an approachable spice

42:26.940 --> 42:32.100
Yeah, yeah, perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Dave Thomas rose from his grave and tried to choke me and my family to death

42:32.620 --> 42:36.860
This thing's so spicy. He said this isn't my Wendy's anymore. You have to change the name

42:37.340 --> 42:39.340
Change it to hell

42:39.340 --> 42:41.340
That's what you've done to my beloved brand

42:41.340 --> 42:45.940
This fucking shit is spicy and craveable. Walk it back walk it back. Just a little bit

42:45.940 --> 42:47.940
It's an approachable spice

42:47.940 --> 42:49.940
No, that's what happened

42:49.940 --> 42:55.940
It must be told. Dave Thomas rose from his grave and tried to choke me and my family to death

42:55.940 --> 42:58.620
What he meant to say was it's an approachable spice

42:59.180 --> 43:05.620
Dave Thomas actually rose from his grave to say this is a great addition to our menu. It would pair great with a Frosty

43:05.620 --> 43:09.140
It would really have to cool down your palate just 99 cents

43:09.140 --> 43:12.980
He busted out. He said this is great for vegetarians and God love our troops

43:19.940 --> 43:22.500
It's so spicy it made me hate our troops

43:26.500 --> 43:28.500
I have a clear shot. Take it

43:28.500 --> 43:48.500
Take it. Take it out. God is dead and this sandwich killed him. No no no no no. I've seen the end. It was so hot I could see through time to the very collapse of the universe. This is all meaningless. Nothing matters.

43:50.500 --> 43:56.500
Everything you do is pointless. We're all on a trajectory that was planned long before the invention of time

43:56.500 --> 44:06.500
But do enjoy the Frosty with it. You can dip your fries in it. It's delicious. He's right. It's craveable. The craveability is inarguable. We can all agree on that.

44:06.500 --> 44:24.500
The sniper is nodding his head. Yes we can. Single tear on his face. You are my best friend. I had to take this shot and I have to put you in the ground but this burger is flavorful. But I'll marry your wife just like I promised.

44:24.500 --> 44:40.500
I will and I'll raise your son just like you would have wanted with lots of spicy foods. But not too spicy. I'm sorry I have to stop the interview. Sir did you just Morse code tap on the table that your butt got turned into a volcano by this hot hot spicy...

44:40.500 --> 44:46.500
No. No. These are actual jalapenos. Wink.

44:46.500 --> 45:06.500
This is the perfect triumvirate of butt problems where it's incredibly spicy with several new kinds of jalapenos that are actually jalapenos and mainly black beans and also made at Wendy's. So it's going to have a real kind of ribble bathroom after party that you should check out.

45:06.500 --> 45:21.500
Hey listen if anyone from Wendy's is listening I'm actually a big fan of Wendy's. I love what you guys are doing. Love Wendy's. Love them. I don't know why Justin said that you guys make people's butts hurt. I've never had that experience at Junior Bacon Cheeseburger. It's like my favorite thing. I don't know why Justin said that.

45:21.500 --> 45:32.500
I'm conflating the time that I had diarrhea and had to drive quickly to Wendy's to throw away my underwear. But Wendy's was there for you in that moment Justin. That was and I shouldn't be dragging them down.

45:32.500 --> 45:40.500
Especially when they're churning out some of the most craveable menu options.

45:40.500 --> 45:44.500
I'm a vegan and have a full time job. So my brother called me...

45:44.500 --> 45:49.500
I'm looking for a burger that will fucking shatter my reality.

45:49.500 --> 46:04.500
I'm a vegan and have a full time job. So when my brother called me and offered to make me handmade vegan spaghetti I accepted. It's now sitting in front of me and it's gross. The problem is he spent two and a half hours making it and he's sitting right behind me.

46:04.500 --> 46:19.500
Brothers, how do I dispose of the spaghetti he made specifically without him seeing? Follow up. How do I get more food later without getting caught? That's from stealthily disposing of spaghetti in a Spokane.

46:19.500 --> 46:22.500
You can't just put it in the garbage. Too visible. He's going to open that garbage later?

46:22.500 --> 46:24.500
Yeah.

46:24.500 --> 46:29.500
God and there's not a lot of like outside animals that eat spaghetti that you could like chuck it to?

46:29.500 --> 46:38.500
You would have to make it to a window at that point too. I think your best bet is maybe a two-part disposal where you're going to put it in like a drawer that's rarely used.

46:38.500 --> 46:44.500
Right? Dump it in that drawer. And then you're going to recover that in an hour or so when the heat's off.

46:44.500 --> 46:45.500
Yeah.

46:45.500 --> 46:50.500
Right? And then you're going to need...

46:50.500 --> 46:52.500
This is a two person operation.

46:52.500 --> 46:53.500
Yeah.

46:53.500 --> 46:54.500
No matter what.

46:54.500 --> 46:57.500
You need a friend to collaborate.

46:57.500 --> 47:02.500
You could do an accidental dump on the floor, right? Where you turn too quickly.

47:02.500 --> 47:03.500
That's so mean, Mel.

47:03.500 --> 47:14.500
Yeah, yeah. That's really mean. That's going to hurt a lot. You know, spaghetti is a really good food for scooting it into mounds and then acting like, ugh.

47:14.500 --> 47:15.500
I couldn't possibly.

47:15.500 --> 47:18.500
I'm stuffed. I've eaten so much of it.

47:18.500 --> 47:22.500
Could you put it on your head and pretend it's your hair?

47:22.500 --> 47:25.500
Oh, there's something there.

47:25.500 --> 47:27.500
Is there? Well, I mean, you're going to have to style it.

47:27.500 --> 47:29.500
No, there's something there for sure.

47:29.500 --> 47:36.500
It's a kind of permanent solution though at that point because if it starts to fall off, hmm.

47:36.500 --> 47:43.500
You could ask, what's in this? And then have them go down the list of ingredients.

47:43.500 --> 47:48.500
And at some point in there, be like, oh, did you say capers? This ain't vegan.

47:48.500 --> 47:49.500
Yeah.

47:49.500 --> 47:50.500
Oh, yeah.

47:50.500 --> 47:56.500
Yeah, capers. You wouldn't think it, but they're just little snail eyes.

47:56.500 --> 47:58.500
Are you sure? I thought they were like little weird olives.

47:58.500 --> 48:01.500
Nah, man. They're fucking snail feet.

48:01.500 --> 48:03.500
Sucks. You worked real hard on this.

48:03.500 --> 48:08.500
Sucks that you undid all that good hard work just because you weren't paying attention to the ingredients.

48:08.500 --> 48:11.500
How about I order some steaks, huh? I'll get on DoorDash.

48:11.500 --> 48:18.500
Let's get some steaks and some pork rinds.

48:18.500 --> 48:22.500
I don't know what you want me to say to this question.

48:22.500 --> 48:26.500
I need full situational awareness to do a cheat like this.

48:26.500 --> 48:30.500
You didn't even give us like exits.

48:30.500 --> 48:32.500
You know, we have no information.

48:32.500 --> 48:34.500
How big are your pockets?

48:34.500 --> 48:37.500
Yeah. Are you wearing loose pants like a ginko jean?

48:37.500 --> 48:40.500
Are they lined with spaghetti proof plastic?

48:40.500 --> 48:42.500
Do you have a dog in the house?

48:42.500 --> 48:47.500
And it's so important. Make sure that the plastic is rated for spaghetti.

48:47.500 --> 48:50.500
Don't just use Ziploc. It's not rated for spaghetti.

48:50.500 --> 48:52.500
How big is the kitchen counter?

48:52.500 --> 48:55.500
Because you could potentially spread like one strand here, one strand there.

48:55.500 --> 49:00.500
Like some sort of Easter egg hunt where even if they saw individual strands,

49:00.500 --> 49:04.500
it would not seem like enough to make up an entire plate of spaghetti.

49:04.500 --> 49:06.500
And you could just be like, oh, it was so delicious.

49:06.500 --> 49:11.500
I just tore into it like the Tasmanian devil and launched those little bastards all over the kitchen.

49:11.500 --> 49:15.500
Yeah. I tore it up all crazy like a wild boar.

49:15.500 --> 49:17.500
And I spun into it.

49:17.500 --> 49:22.500
I turned into a tornado and I spun into the middle of it and spaghetti was everywhere.

49:22.500 --> 49:23.500
I'm so, so sorry.

49:23.500 --> 49:24.500
Oh, that's good.

49:24.500 --> 49:26.500
I mean, you could do it for real though, right in front of them.

49:26.500 --> 49:31.500
And just like, yeah, like smash your face into it like the Cookie Monster

49:31.500 --> 49:33.500
and you're only going to have to eat a couple bites,

49:33.500 --> 49:36.500
but the rest of it is just going to go hither and yon.

49:36.500 --> 49:43.500
Yeah. If you Cookie Monster it, it'll look like maximum impact with like minimum intake.

49:43.500 --> 49:44.500
Very little work.

49:44.500 --> 49:46.500
You could also do that thing where you turn like profile to him

49:46.500 --> 49:49.500
and you open your mouth up and you turn your head facing upward

49:49.500 --> 49:51.500
and you hold up one strand at a time and go like, ah.

49:51.500 --> 49:55.500
But actually you're dropping it beside your face on the opposite side of him.

49:55.500 --> 49:57.500
And you're going to do that a lot.

49:57.500 --> 49:59.500
It's going to take a long time to get through this.

49:59.500 --> 50:04.500
Just now and it's going to look like it's disappearing into your mouth,

50:04.500 --> 50:05.500
but you're not really eating it.

50:05.500 --> 50:07.500
It's a magic trick.

50:07.500 --> 50:11.500
Could you turn it into a braided bracelet?

50:11.500 --> 50:12.500
That's cool.

50:12.500 --> 50:14.500
Give it, give it right back.

50:14.500 --> 50:15.500
Yeah.

50:15.500 --> 50:16.500
Spaghetti bracelet.

50:16.500 --> 50:17.500
Spaghetti bracelet for brothers.

50:17.500 --> 50:22.500
How do you fuck up spaghetti that bad, especially once you work on it for two hours?

50:22.500 --> 50:23.500
Spaghetti squash.

50:23.500 --> 50:27.500
This is where I've been thinking about the entire time I've been sitting here.

50:27.500 --> 50:28.500
Yeah.

50:28.500 --> 50:31.500
Spaghetti squash that you've just done wrong, right?

50:31.500 --> 50:39.500
Squash has, we could all agree has a limited window of viability.

50:39.500 --> 50:40.500
Yeah.

50:40.500 --> 50:43.500
Well, here's what I will say as a parent.

50:43.500 --> 50:46.500
It says it's sitting in front of you and it's gross,

50:46.500 --> 50:49.500
which makes me think maybe you haven't tried it.

50:49.500 --> 50:52.500
So maybe it doesn't look, maybe it doesn't look like your thing.

50:52.500 --> 50:53.500
Open it up.

50:53.500 --> 50:54.500
Open it up.

50:54.500 --> 50:56.500
But maybe take a bite and see if you like it.

50:56.500 --> 50:59.500
How about a three bite rule, just like Pete the Cat says.

50:59.500 --> 51:02.500
You try three bites and you see if you like it.

51:02.500 --> 51:03.500
Because it might be good.

51:03.500 --> 51:05.500
It might be good, little baby.

51:05.500 --> 51:08.500
So open the hair and here comes the airplane.

51:08.500 --> 51:09.500
Vroom, vroom.

51:09.500 --> 51:10.500
Here we come.

51:10.500 --> 51:11.500
Brrrr.

51:11.500 --> 51:13.500
Oh no, we've been shot.

51:13.500 --> 51:14.500
Got to aim.

51:14.500 --> 51:16.500
We're coming in for a hot landing.

51:16.500 --> 51:20.500
Oh, it's the sub with Campbell being chased by the Red Baron.

51:20.500 --> 51:22.500
You're not opening your mouth.

51:22.500 --> 51:23.500
What's wrong?

51:23.500 --> 51:24.500
Eat it.

51:24.500 --> 51:25.500
Oh no.

51:25.500 --> 51:27.500
Then it never crashes into the hangar, does it?

51:27.500 --> 51:28.500
No.

51:28.500 --> 51:29.500
No.

51:29.500 --> 51:32.500
I wish my, I'm glad my son doesn't know that.

51:32.500 --> 51:34.500
That if he just doesn't open his mouth,

51:34.500 --> 51:39.500
I'm not going to smash the spaghetti into his closed mouth.

51:39.500 --> 51:44.500
It's a little life hack for you four year olds.

51:44.500 --> 51:47.500
Before we wrap up, can I talk about my life real quick?

51:47.500 --> 51:48.500
Yeah, I guess so.

51:48.500 --> 51:58.500
This weird thing happened with minions where the groups that were posting lots of different memes went private.

51:58.500 --> 52:01.500
And then these groups were only minions.

52:01.500 --> 52:03.500
It's really weird, guys.

52:03.500 --> 52:05.500
If you look for these groups, you can't find them anymore.

52:05.500 --> 52:07.500
It was really hard to find the last batch.

52:07.500 --> 52:09.500
That's not what I want to talk about though.

52:09.500 --> 52:12.500
I got into one that was invite only.

52:12.500 --> 52:13.500
Oh, okay.

52:13.500 --> 52:17.500
Where you had to answer questions like, I mean, I think the question was like, do you love minions?

52:17.500 --> 52:19.500
Was that a tough one?

52:19.500 --> 52:22.500
It was a tough one, but I came down with yes.

52:22.500 --> 52:28.500
But now that I'm in the groups, I'm afraid to leave because what if I need them?

52:28.500 --> 52:31.500
They would get suspicious if I left.

52:31.500 --> 52:36.500
I just want to tell you guys some stuff that's happened in the groups.

52:36.500 --> 52:43.500
They've gone so that they're not really talking about minions as much as you would think they would be talking about minions.

52:43.500 --> 52:46.500
I would think they would be speaking about the minions quite a bit.

52:46.500 --> 52:55.500
I mean, there's a good amount of minions material, but here's a poll that someone put up that said the monsters or the Addams Family, which one was the best show?

52:55.500 --> 52:56.500
Oh, fuck.

52:56.500 --> 52:57.500
It's very nuanced.

52:57.500 --> 52:59.500
I don't know if there's a clear answer to that.

52:59.500 --> 53:03.500
So I'm going to read you guys without any names.

53:03.500 --> 53:07.500
I'm going to read you guys without skipping anything.

53:07.500 --> 53:09.500
The answer.

53:09.500 --> 53:11.500
Okay, the answers that this post received.

53:11.500 --> 53:15.500
By the way, people go absolutely bug nuts for these.

53:15.500 --> 53:20.500
There's 283 respondents wanting to rushing, rushing to give you their two cents.

53:20.500 --> 53:21.500
Ready?

53:21.500 --> 53:22.500
Yep.

53:22.500 --> 53:25.500
Both shows are better than most reality shows they have now.

53:25.500 --> 53:26.500
Okay.

53:26.500 --> 53:27.500
That wasn't part of it.

53:27.500 --> 53:29.500
So wait, wait, hold on.

53:29.500 --> 53:33.500
Do you think, can we, did you think those are reality television programs?

53:33.500 --> 53:34.500
Huh?

53:34.500 --> 53:36.500
Anyway, so both shows.

53:36.500 --> 53:37.500
Okay.

53:37.500 --> 53:38.500
Both.

53:38.500 --> 53:39.500
Both.

53:39.500 --> 53:40.500
Tammy.

53:40.500 --> 53:41.500
Both.

53:41.500 --> 53:42.500
Amber.

53:42.500 --> 53:43.500
I like both of them.

53:43.500 --> 53:44.500
Beth.

53:44.500 --> 53:45.500
Toss up.

53:45.500 --> 53:46.500
Cassie.

53:46.500 --> 53:47.500
Love them both.

53:47.500 --> 53:48.500
Gordon.

53:48.500 --> 53:49.500
Love them both.

53:49.500 --> 53:50.500
Roma.

53:50.500 --> 53:51.500
Both funny.

53:51.500 --> 53:52.500
Stephanie.

53:52.500 --> 53:53.500
I love both.

53:53.500 --> 53:54.500
Donna.

53:54.500 --> 53:55.500
I love them both equally.

53:55.500 --> 53:56.500
Donna.

53:56.500 --> 53:57.500
I love them both.

53:57.500 --> 53:58.500
Hermelina.

53:58.500 --> 53:59.500
Love them both.

53:59.500 --> 54:00.500
Huh?

54:00.500 --> 54:01.500
Scott.

54:01.500 --> 54:02.500
Love them both.

54:02.500 --> 54:03.500
Elaine.

54:03.500 --> 54:04.500
I hate making choices.

54:04.500 --> 54:05.500
Crap.

54:05.500 --> 54:06.500
I love watching both as a kid.

54:06.500 --> 54:07.500
Crap.

54:07.500 --> 54:08.500
Lisa says, I like both.

54:08.500 --> 54:09.500
We're not getting anywhere.

54:09.500 --> 54:10.500
Jan said.

54:10.500 --> 54:11.500
I, both, but a force to pick.

54:11.500 --> 54:12.500
I'd go for Adam's family.

54:12.500 --> 54:13.500
Claire.

54:13.500 --> 54:14.500
Both were awesome.

54:14.500 --> 54:15.500
I grew up watching both.

54:15.500 --> 54:16.500
Dwayne.

54:16.500 --> 54:17.500
Can't choose.

54:17.500 --> 54:18.500
Love them both.

54:18.500 --> 54:28.500
Angela.

54:28.500 --> 54:34.500
Adam's family spelled A-D-A-M apostrophe S. Hi, I'm Adam and this is my family.

54:34.500 --> 54:37.500
Welcome to my wild mixed up family.

54:37.500 --> 54:38.500
Deborah.

54:38.500 --> 54:39.500
Both.

54:39.500 --> 54:40.500
Lynn.

54:40.500 --> 54:41.500
Picture of a flossing skeleton.

54:41.500 --> 54:42.500
Okay.

54:42.500 --> 54:43.500
Okay.

54:43.500 --> 54:44.500
Frank.

54:44.500 --> 54:45.500
Both.

54:45.500 --> 54:46.500
Oh, boy.

54:46.500 --> 54:47.500
Which one would you guys pick?

54:47.500 --> 54:50.500
Don't make me choose, but probably Adam's family.

54:50.500 --> 54:51.500
Adam's family.

54:51.500 --> 54:52.500
Definitely.

54:52.500 --> 55:00.780
But that 1313 Mockingbird Lane, an unaired pilot that Brian Fuller made that was an adaptation

55:00.780 --> 55:05.500
starring Jerry O'Connell as Herman Munster and Eddie Izzard as grandpa thing.

55:05.500 --> 55:06.500
What?

55:06.500 --> 55:07.500
Fucking slapped.

55:07.500 --> 55:08.500
Yeah.

55:08.500 --> 55:09.500
It was very extremely good.

55:09.500 --> 55:10.500
The answer is both.

55:10.500 --> 55:11.500
Is what I was looking for.

55:11.500 --> 55:12.500
Oh, both.

55:12.500 --> 55:14.020
Hey, thanks for listening to our podcast.

55:14.020 --> 55:18.780
We hope you have enjoyed yourself and had a lot of fun and made some new friends along

55:18.780 --> 55:19.780
the way.

55:19.780 --> 55:20.780
Learn something.

55:20.780 --> 55:21.780
Learn something about yourself.

55:21.780 --> 55:28.540
Our video on demand of the summer boybeque is still available for just a little bit longer

55:28.540 --> 55:34.100
if you go to bit.ly slash M-B-M-B-A-M virtual, so go check that out.

55:34.100 --> 55:40.500
Oh, Taz Crystal Kingdom, our newest Adventure Zone graphic novel comes out next week, July

55:40.500 --> 55:42.380
13th, 2021.

55:42.380 --> 55:43.380
Go ahead and get that pre-order.

55:43.380 --> 55:44.380
What are you waiting for?

55:44.380 --> 55:52.260
It's bit.ly slash AdventureZoneComic.com, but even more exciting, we're doing a live

55:52.260 --> 55:56.660
and virtual event to celebrate the graphic novel coming out on July 13th.

55:56.660 --> 55:59.500
We've got special guests coming and I'm not going to tell you who they are now, but we've

55:59.500 --> 56:04.460
all got to line up and it's going to be wild, wild and silly and you're going to have a

56:04.460 --> 56:05.500
great time.

56:05.500 --> 56:12.300
Go to bit.ly slash Taz G-N-L-I-V-E-2-0-2-1.

56:12.300 --> 56:16.060
That's Taz G-N-L-I-V-E-2-0-2-1 for more info.

56:16.060 --> 56:20.980
It's got event exclusive signed book plates are available from our partner bookstores.

56:20.980 --> 56:26.180
More info can be found at that link and we have a non-event exclusive pre-order gift

56:26.180 --> 56:29.920
from First Second, which is a Kravitz lenticular laptop sticker.

56:29.920 --> 56:35.260
You can submit your pre-order receipts at bit.ly slash Taz for pre-order.

56:35.260 --> 56:39.180
Lot of bit.ly's in there, but it's all worth it.

56:39.180 --> 56:40.180
All worth it.

56:40.180 --> 56:41.180
Tell me about that merch, Griffin.

56:41.180 --> 56:46.620
Yeah, we got lots of merch at our McElroy merch page, including a new pin of the month

56:46.620 --> 56:51.620
for the Gushy Wolves, which if you've listened to the Ethersea Setup episodes, you know,

56:51.620 --> 56:57.060
of course it's the mascot for the, I guess, only school in that entire world.

56:57.060 --> 56:58.780
We love the Gushy Wolves.

56:58.780 --> 57:03.140
And the sales for that are going to benefit the Innocence Project, which exonerates the

57:03.140 --> 57:07.060
wrongly convicted through DNA testing and reforms the criminal justice system to prevent

57:07.060 --> 57:08.660
future injustice.

57:08.660 --> 57:10.980
There's other stuff on there too.

57:10.980 --> 57:14.060
This trash sticker from the MBMBAM TV show.

57:14.060 --> 57:19.780
There's a beautiful green stoneware mug with the Taz logo on it.

57:19.780 --> 57:26.020
And even the besties is getting in on the game with a video game book club shirt.

57:26.020 --> 57:31.780
And it's very, it's very stylish, and you'll get lots of compliments on it.

57:31.780 --> 57:33.560
And hey, you know what?

57:33.560 --> 57:38.260
Thank you to Montaigne for using our theme song, and that theme song is called My Life

57:38.260 --> 57:44.900
is Better with You, and when it drops, and we know when, we know when it drops.

57:44.900 --> 57:50.300
We basically have our fingers on the Switch that when we flip it, then the song goes live

57:50.300 --> 57:51.300
on iTunes.

57:51.300 --> 57:53.940
Yeah, it's up to us and we're withholding it.

57:53.940 --> 57:58.100
And that's the important thing is that you make sure that you know that it's fully us

57:58.100 --> 58:00.940
and we're the ones that iTunes calls us every day.

58:00.940 --> 58:05.820
It's like, we have a song now and we're like, oh, sorry, we're so busy.

58:05.820 --> 58:08.900
Did you guys know that Montaigne streams on Twitch?

58:08.900 --> 58:10.740
I did not know that, but it tracks.

58:10.740 --> 58:13.260
Yeah, actual Montaigne on Twitch.

58:13.260 --> 58:17.940
I just watched Montaigne do a Sims 4 stream the other day.

58:17.940 --> 58:20.100
It was absolutely wonderful.

58:20.100 --> 58:22.860

58:22.860 --> 58:25.300
It is TheTravisMcElroy.

58:25.300 --> 58:28.300
I've been getting into Overwatch, if you can believe it.

58:28.300 --> 58:29.300
Trying to get good at it.

58:29.300 --> 58:30.300
It's 1998.

58:30.300 --> 58:38.060
Yeah, with that and NBA Jam, new games I'm checking out.

58:38.060 --> 58:39.300
Here's a final Yahoo.

58:39.300 --> 58:41.620
This one was sent in by Breckin Meyer.

58:41.620 --> 58:42.620
Whoa.

58:42.620 --> 58:45.160
Yeah, pretty badass.

58:45.160 --> 58:48.300
And it's asked by Shrek and Pryor.

58:48.300 --> 58:49.300
Huh.

58:49.300 --> 58:50.300
Who...

58:50.300 --> 58:53.360
Sorry, Shrek and Pryor?

58:53.360 --> 58:55.060
It's Richard Pryor's grandsons.

58:55.060 --> 58:56.100
Got it.

58:56.100 --> 58:58.500
His Shrek-based grandson.

58:58.500 --> 58:59.500
Shrek-inspired.

58:59.500 --> 59:03.820
Shrek-inspired asks...

59:03.820 --> 59:13.420
That's weird, it just says Donkey with five exclamation points and four question marks.

59:13.420 --> 59:16.740
I don't even know how this one got past the filters on Yahoo.

59:16.740 --> 59:24.340
I think it has to be two words, but it just says Donkey on it.

59:24.340 --> 59:25.340
Is there a question?

59:25.340 --> 59:26.340
That was it, Donkey.

59:26.340 --> 59:27.340
That was the whole...

59:27.340 --> 59:28.340
Yeah, that was the whole thing.

59:28.340 --> 59:29.340
My name is Justin McElroy.

59:29.340 --> 59:30.340
Travis McElroy.

59:30.340 --> 59:31.340
Maybe it didn't load.

59:31.340 --> 59:32.340
Let me refresh the browser.

59:32.340 --> 59:33.340
I finished that.

59:33.340 --> 59:34.340
No.

59:34.340 --> 59:35.340
It's...

59:35.340 --> 59:36.340
This is Griffin McElroy.

59:36.340 --> 59:37.340
It's the full page.

59:37.340 --> 59:39.420
This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me, Kissy Tats.

59:39.420 --> 59:41.100
Go wear on the lips.
