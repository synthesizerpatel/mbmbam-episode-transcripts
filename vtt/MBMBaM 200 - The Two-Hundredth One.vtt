WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:46.560 --> 00:53.760
Inrich, don't you approve? Is that the song you're going with?

00:54.640 --> 01:01.280
One who's just running around, one who can't move.

01:01.280 --> 01:03.040
Let me throw this out. Let me throw this song out.

01:03.040 --> 01:08.880
Where are the clowns? Okay, now try this song on. Are you ready?

01:08.880 --> 01:20.000
As we go on, we remember all the times we had together.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.960
This is it. I couldn't remember the rest of the song.

01:26.960 --> 01:32.160
It definitely doesn't spiral off into whatever that Zelda menu music you were just doodling.

01:32.160 --> 01:38.000
That was pop and circumstance, I think. What song would you like to sing, Griffin?

01:38.000 --> 01:42.800
Just when I'd stopped opening doors. Justin has it on the nose.

01:43.360 --> 01:46.400
Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours.

01:48.320 --> 01:55.760
Making my entrance again with my usual flair. Sure of my lies.

01:55.760 --> 01:58.240
It's a little bit masturbatory, this introduction so far.

01:59.600 --> 02:03.280
No one is there. It feels like those episodes of Quantum Leap

02:03.280 --> 02:10.800
where Scott Bakula would jump into Elvis and be like, just because you wanted to sing.

02:10.800 --> 02:15.600
Losing my timing this late in my career. It says in my writer,

02:15.600 --> 02:18.320
Donald Bellisario, I get four singing episodes this season.

02:18.320 --> 02:21.840
Where are the clowns? Quick.

02:23.120 --> 02:28.080
Big finish. Send in the clowns.

02:28.720 --> 02:30.720
Oh, fuck it. Don't bother.

02:30.720 --> 02:39.920
They are on fire. I haven't heard the song.

02:40.800 --> 02:43.840
We're here. The clowns. My brother, my brother and me.

02:44.400 --> 02:48.480
Don't need to send us in. We're here. Episode 200. It's huge.

02:48.480 --> 02:52.800
Can we not play it up like we made all these big grand plans for the old-

02:52.800 --> 02:55.440
We have a special guest star. Larry the Cable Guy.

02:55.440 --> 03:01.120
Hey, hell yeah, get her done. All right, brothers.

03:01.120 --> 03:03.600
Thanks so much for having me. Get her done.

03:03.600 --> 03:07.760
I want to say hello to all them little pygmy children out there.

03:07.760 --> 03:10.400
Lord, I apologize. Get her done, data salad.

03:13.600 --> 03:19.040
Yeah, your side. I have been confused.

03:19.040 --> 03:22.320
We are Hivemind now. We are one of the blue-collar comps

03:22.320 --> 03:26.640
who are fused into one man. We fell on a big pit of comedy acid

03:26.640 --> 03:30.000
and now we're just a big gelatinous blob of country idioms.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
Get her done, salad. I'm Larry the Fox High Decker

03:34.000 --> 03:38.160
and I'm here to tell you that get her done, son.

03:39.440 --> 03:42.320
Please kill me. Please set me free from-

03:42.320 --> 03:45.040
I've got seven arms. My mortal pain.

03:46.880 --> 03:50.880
I'm in a flesh prison, y'all. I'm in a prison of flesh.

03:50.880 --> 03:54.000
I have no mouth, but I must screen get her done.

03:57.440 --> 04:00.080
Listen, we didn't do- It seems like a good episode to start with.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.600
It seems like it's pretty good so far.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.320
If you wanted to get somebody on board with the show,

04:04.320 --> 04:06.800
this seems like the one that you would tell them to jump on with.

04:06.800 --> 04:12.320
Episode 200. We have passed actually last month,

04:12.320 --> 04:15.840
without comment, our four-year anniversary.

04:15.840 --> 04:21.920
Oh, wow. 2010 is when this whole crazy journey got started.

04:21.920 --> 04:24.720
And when will it end, Justin? When will it end?

04:25.600 --> 04:31.120
December 12th, 2016, along with all of the rest of creation.

04:31.120 --> 04:32.480
So mark it down.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.200
That dude was so close. And by that dude,

04:35.200 --> 04:37.760
I mean the entire Mayan culture, I guess.

04:37.760 --> 04:39.680
Their whole- Their whole sort of thing.

04:40.480 --> 04:44.240
We're saving the juice for 500. We're not even fucking halfway there.

04:44.240 --> 04:48.880
500? We'll destroy 500. We will have special guests.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.560
We will get Billy Crystal.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.160
We will have jet packs.

04:52.160 --> 04:53.520
We will have jet packs.

04:53.520 --> 04:56.720
We'll get Billy Crystal over to our studio with a jet pack.

04:57.760 --> 04:59.680
I don't know what's more unlikely in that scenario,

04:59.680 --> 05:01.920
that A, we will somehow get a hold of Billy Crystal.

05:01.920 --> 05:03.040
B, there will be jet packs.

05:03.040 --> 05:08.480
Or C, that the three of us will somehow pool our resources to have a studio.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.560
I think it's actually most unlikely that we'll stick with this

05:12.560 --> 05:15.280
for like another seven years. For another 300 episodes, yeah.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.760
God, I hope not. Oh, God. Don't even say that.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.280
I get a little scared just thinking about it.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.600
Anyway, this is our Comedy Advice Show.

05:21.600 --> 05:23.920
My brother, my brother, and me, you're here.

05:24.480 --> 05:26.640
It's gonna be a lot easier to keep track of these

05:26.640 --> 05:28.080
now that we're starting at 200.

05:28.080 --> 05:32.080
It seems like counting has become hard.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.080
187. Like, what does that even mean?

05:34.080 --> 05:35.600
What is- What is 187?

05:35.600 --> 05:38.560
What is 187? 200. What are numbers?

05:38.560 --> 05:39.760
That's a big one.

05:39.760 --> 05:42.240
So let's- Like, we're not gonna do that much different,

05:42.240 --> 05:44.400
except just like help you.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.800
We're gonna check in with some old friends.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.560
We're gonna tell you about some snacks.

05:49.120 --> 05:51.440
And it's just gonna be like a regular show.

05:51.440 --> 05:52.400
So it's gonna be great.

05:53.680 --> 05:54.320
I hope you like it.

05:54.960 --> 05:55.680
Hi, brothers.

05:55.680 --> 05:58.560
I've been spending the last year or so getting fit and beefy.

05:58.560 --> 06:01.600
I got designs drawn up for a couple tattoos that I've wanted for a few years.

06:01.600 --> 06:05.280
I've told myself I'd only get them when I finally got my sexy right.

06:05.280 --> 06:08.320
Now that I'm there, I feel like I might be too old to get my first tattoo.

06:08.320 --> 06:09.600
I'm 25.

06:09.600 --> 06:12.400
I get the feeling getting your first tattoo is something for rebellious teens

06:12.400 --> 06:13.840
or dipshit college kids.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.840
Did I miss the window or am I good?

06:15.840 --> 06:17.600
That's from Hesitant in Houston.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.920
What kind of world do we live in that at 25,

06:19.920 --> 06:22.400
someone's worried they're too old to do something?

06:22.400 --> 06:23.920
To do anything.

06:23.920 --> 06:24.560
Oh my god.

06:24.560 --> 06:29.120
If 25's too old to do anything, that is only exacerbating my panic attack.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.000
Please.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.200
I'm 33 years old.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.960
Please tell me that's not too old to do anything.

06:32.960 --> 06:33.760
Look at me.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.920
25 got all my shit together.

06:35.920 --> 06:39.040
Living up here in the adult life in this penthouse.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.200
My old rotten bones.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.360
Could stick it up at noon.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.360
Wait, do you have Jack disease?

06:45.360 --> 06:47.200
I didn't ask.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.120
Do you have Jack Bauer disease?

06:49.120 --> 06:50.240
Can I tell you guys something?

06:50.240 --> 06:53.520
I think our advice would be a hundred times better

06:53.520 --> 06:58.160
if we would stop assuming that everyone who asks us for advice has Jack disease.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.600
But it wouldn't be as applicable to that one person that does.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.760
Yeah, I mean, one out of every-

07:03.760 --> 07:06.320
No one's talking to me, the one guy with Jack disease.

07:06.320 --> 07:09.120
One out of every hundred people does have progenitals.

07:09.120 --> 07:13.280
What if, okay, I'm not talking about the actual disease.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.680
I'm talking about Jack disease.

07:15.680 --> 07:18.560
The other thing's a real thing that is not funny.

07:18.560 --> 07:23.520
No, most diseases are not known for their humor quantity.

07:23.520 --> 07:24.880
Except for chuckle peas.

07:24.880 --> 07:25.760
And jungle fever.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.880
Here's my advice.

07:32.880 --> 07:36.240
One, two, three, and fuck it.

07:36.240 --> 07:36.960
Yeah.

07:36.960 --> 07:39.280
It's you're 25, you wanna get a tattoo?

07:39.280 --> 07:40.560
I think 25 is a great time.

07:40.560 --> 07:43.120
I think I was probably around 25 when I got my first tattoo.

07:43.120 --> 07:44.000
Maybe younger, yes.

07:44.640 --> 07:46.720
I think, here's the question though.

07:47.600 --> 07:53.680
If you're a beefy dude, I'm gonna assume that this guy is like thick as shit.

07:53.680 --> 07:55.920
Not chunky, but like-

07:55.920 --> 07:57.280
Like Vin Diesel.

07:58.080 --> 08:02.000
Like Vin Diesel, but maybe a little bit shorter

08:02.000 --> 08:05.280
and a little bit thicker and a little bit broader,

08:05.280 --> 08:06.880
but it's all muscle mass.

08:06.880 --> 08:07.440
I'm thinking-

08:08.800 --> 08:10.960
You are painting quite the word picture.

08:10.960 --> 08:15.280
I'm thinking of like the thing from the Fantastic Four.

08:15.280 --> 08:17.280
Lot of ripples and a lot of bulges.

08:17.280 --> 08:19.920
And I think when you are that rippled and bulged,

08:21.040 --> 08:23.520
you can't get a Triforce tattoo.

08:23.520 --> 08:25.680
You have to get some tribal shit on your neck.

08:26.240 --> 08:27.040
Oh yeah.

08:27.040 --> 08:27.360
Yeah.

08:27.360 --> 08:31.040
You have to get a sleeve of tribal, I think just tribal shit in general.

08:31.040 --> 08:37.040
I think the tribal tattoo industry is built upon the scaffolding of 100 beefy men.

08:37.040 --> 08:38.480
Let me throw this out.

08:38.480 --> 08:43.120
Tribal tattoo around your bicep, but you only tattoo three quarters of the way around.

08:43.840 --> 08:46.480
And then when people ask why you didn't finish it,

08:46.480 --> 08:48.720
you say, oh, it used to touch.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.080
And then I started working out.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.920
That's my extra skin I got.

08:55.920 --> 09:04.080
Oh, I was just like totally ripping, lifting, crushing, dipping, squatting, potting, jumping,

09:04.080 --> 09:08.720
and crumping in the gymnasium with a lot of super heavy weights.

09:08.720 --> 09:12.800
And I just looked down one day, I was like, oh no, my tattoo got interrupted

09:12.800 --> 09:15.520
by the new skin that showed up with the extra muscles that I built.

09:15.520 --> 09:16.240
Yikes.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.160
I think tribal is absolutely the way to go.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.280
I think it's got to look like,

09:19.280 --> 09:24.080
it should look like a spiky alien is eating you from the inside, consuming you gradually.

09:24.640 --> 09:25.520
That's what it should look like.

09:25.520 --> 09:29.440
The dream is that it looks like the Venom suit mid-transformation, right?

09:29.440 --> 09:30.000
Correct.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.840
That's the idea with tribal tattoos.

09:33.520 --> 09:34.480
Where do you get it though?

09:35.280 --> 09:36.720
I'm a fan of Nex-

09:36.720 --> 09:37.520
Prison.

09:37.520 --> 09:38.020
Okay.

09:38.880 --> 09:44.560
Wouldn't it be great to get a tribal tattoo while you were working with Greenpeace in a tribe?

09:44.560 --> 09:47.760
And then when someone's like, oh, fuck a tribal tattoo, be like, yeah, I got this.

09:48.400 --> 09:52.480
Yeah, but then you don't know, maybe the tattoo says Pussy Willow

09:52.480 --> 09:54.240
and they wouldn't tell you that.

09:54.240 --> 09:56.400
Or even better, you ask for that.

09:56.400 --> 09:59.040
Can I get one that says Pussy Willow and it says like hard ass motherfucker

09:59.040 --> 10:00.160
and you're like, damn it.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.720
Oh no, I definitely wanted Pussy Willow.

10:02.720 --> 10:05.120
I want everyone to know that I am a gentle soul.

10:05.120 --> 10:06.160
Griffin, how about Yahoo?

10:06.720 --> 10:07.220
Sure.

10:08.480 --> 10:11.200
I'm glad we started off our 200th by not helping someone.

10:11.840 --> 10:14.480
I mean, we told them exactly what kind of tattoos to get and where to get it.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.160
So if that's not helping, I don't know what is.

10:16.160 --> 10:18.160
The fuck it is the best advice you can get.

10:18.160 --> 10:18.960
You're 25 years old.

10:18.960 --> 10:20.320
You want to get a tattoo, get a tattoo.

10:20.320 --> 10:20.560
Yeah.

10:20.560 --> 10:21.200
What do I care?

10:22.000 --> 10:23.520
You're pretty far from death.

10:23.520 --> 10:25.120
You got a lot of ball game left to play.

10:25.680 --> 10:26.180
Yeah.

10:27.120 --> 10:31.360
You're still in early innings, optimistically speaking.

10:32.960 --> 10:34.480
This Yahoo was sent in by Peter Steiner.

10:34.480 --> 10:35.440
Thank you, Peter.

10:35.440 --> 10:43.040
It's by a Yahoo Answers user who has been deleted from the Tron grid of Yahoo.

10:44.480 --> 10:45.120
Thank you, Peter.

10:47.040 --> 10:50.640
This mystery user asks, what are some hot guy names?

10:50.640 --> 10:55.920
Uh, this is in the section, pregnancy and parenting baby names.

10:55.920 --> 11:00.480
So they're looking for hot guy names for their baby.

11:00.480 --> 11:00.960
Okay.

11:00.960 --> 11:01.200
Yeah.

11:01.200 --> 11:08.080
Do they mean a hot, do they mean popular or names that would be fit a hot guy?

11:08.880 --> 11:09.520
Hunky dude.

11:09.520 --> 11:11.440
Like, like blaze.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.400
How about this?

11:12.400 --> 11:14.160
Or steel with four L's.

11:14.160 --> 11:15.200
Additional info.

11:15.840 --> 11:16.340
Steel.

11:17.040 --> 11:17.840
Steel.

11:17.840 --> 11:22.160
Steel.

11:22.160 --> 11:22.880
Yeah.

11:22.880 --> 11:26.080
Just tell me guy names that sound hot.

11:26.080 --> 11:26.800
Thanks.

11:26.800 --> 11:27.280
Okay.

11:27.280 --> 11:28.320
That clarifies it.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.200
It's definitely steel.

11:33.520 --> 11:35.360
I mean, they have a point, right?

11:36.400 --> 11:39.600
Rachel and I have been watching a bunch of Survivor because they just added a bunch of

11:39.600 --> 11:40.800
that shit to Hulu.

11:40.800 --> 11:44.960
And I feel like, you know, you don't even need to see the dudes.

11:44.960 --> 11:52.000
You'll hear of like Noah and you're like, fuck, yeah, that dude's going to look awesome.

11:52.560 --> 11:55.520
That's going to be one awesome looking guy.

11:56.160 --> 11:56.400
Yeah.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.120
Or dreams.

11:59.120 --> 12:00.080
Dreams.

12:00.080 --> 12:01.760
Another one of my favorite Survivor.

12:01.760 --> 12:04.560
My name is steel dreams.

12:04.560 --> 12:14.960
So here's some, these are some suggestions from Yahoo.

12:15.840 --> 12:26.080
Fool in the rain says Brody, Jake, Luke, Talon, Spencer, Jackson, Ethan, Heath, Jude.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.560
Matt is usually a hot guy's name.

12:28.560 --> 12:28.880
Matt?

12:29.520 --> 12:30.020
Matt?

12:31.040 --> 12:34.240
I can write from the top of my head name you five despicable mats.

12:34.240 --> 12:35.280
I could name you five.

12:35.280 --> 12:37.040
That was my favorite cartoon movie.

12:37.040 --> 12:41.200
Sort of squirrely mats with weird hair.

12:41.760 --> 12:42.080
I don't know.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.760
What about Matt Mateus?

12:44.880 --> 12:46.080
I don't know who that is.

12:46.080 --> 12:46.480
I don't know.

12:46.480 --> 12:48.160
I'm just saying like that'd be a way hotter version.

12:48.160 --> 12:49.440
Oh, it's super, super hotter.

12:49.440 --> 12:50.160
Yeah, sorry.

12:50.160 --> 12:50.960
Yes, definitely.

12:50.960 --> 12:51.600
Thank you.

12:51.600 --> 12:52.560
What about Mateo?

12:54.240 --> 12:55.520
What about Materia?

12:55.520 --> 12:56.560
Matt-teria.

12:58.240 --> 12:59.200
How about Bahamut?

12:59.760 --> 13:00.880
How about Efreet?

13:00.880 --> 13:02.000
Fight to the round.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.960
Hi, my name is Knights of the round.

13:06.960 --> 13:07.200
Hi.

13:08.240 --> 13:09.600
Hi, my name is Chocobob.

13:13.520 --> 13:14.000
Oh, I get it.

13:14.000 --> 13:14.800
My name is Sid.

13:14.800 --> 13:15.760
That's a much better one.

13:15.760 --> 13:16.640
I should have used Sid.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.000
It's like a real person's name.

13:18.000 --> 13:18.880
And can I tell you something?

13:18.880 --> 13:20.480
It's a fucking hot guy's name.

13:21.040 --> 13:21.760
Sid?

13:21.760 --> 13:25.200
Yeah, I'm just going to just burn down it.

13:25.200 --> 13:25.680
Travis.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.280
Yes, somebody does actually say Blaze.

13:28.640 --> 13:29.360
Silas Matthews.

13:29.360 --> 13:30.080
How many Z's?

13:30.800 --> 13:31.360
Just one.

13:31.360 --> 13:32.720
Just the one regular.

13:32.720 --> 13:35.840
Is it B-L-A with the apostrophe over at Z?

13:36.720 --> 13:37.600
You mean Blase?

13:38.240 --> 13:38.800
No.

13:38.800 --> 13:39.680
No E.

13:39.680 --> 13:42.160
B-L-A with apostrophe, Z.

13:42.160 --> 13:42.960
Blaze.

13:42.960 --> 13:43.520
Blutz.

13:45.040 --> 13:47.840
Silas Matthews, Preston James, Landon Edward,

13:47.840 --> 13:52.640
Call Gregory, K-A-H-L, Indermichael.

13:52.640 --> 13:53.600
Stop it.

13:53.600 --> 13:53.840
Kane.

13:53.840 --> 13:54.560
Whoa.

13:54.560 --> 13:55.280
Wait, are these all?

13:55.280 --> 13:55.920
Wait, hold on.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.360
Are these all like one name?

13:57.360 --> 13:59.680
Like you would name a girl like Sue Ann?

13:59.680 --> 14:00.560
I don't know what you're doing.

14:00.560 --> 14:02.560
Are you saying Indermichael as like a name?

14:02.560 --> 14:03.200
Yeah.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.800
I have a theory to run by you guys that I was just thinking about here.

14:07.440 --> 14:13.440
Okay, you know how the joke when like a rich dude gets a convertible

14:14.720 --> 14:16.880
and everybody jokes that he's compensating for something?

14:16.880 --> 14:19.200
What are you compensating for with your sports car, you know?

14:19.760 --> 14:25.520
I feel like nerdy dads do this with their kids' names.

14:25.520 --> 14:33.120
They will pick the like coolest, hardest sounding child's name

14:33.120 --> 14:37.200
from popular fiction to compensate for,

14:37.200 --> 14:42.160
like when I hear you named your kid Ender or Han, for example,

14:42.160 --> 14:44.640
just to name two off the top of my head,

14:44.640 --> 14:47.680
I feel like you're overcompensating for something.

14:47.680 --> 14:53.440
You're trying to gird this child with a sort of veneer of rugged cool

14:53.440 --> 14:58.080
that maybe has escaped you throughout your earlier years.

14:58.080 --> 15:00.240
But at the same time, I'm with you on that, Justin.

15:00.240 --> 15:01.200
I genuinely am.

15:01.760 --> 15:04.800
But at the same time, I've never met a Brody

15:04.800 --> 15:08.400
that I wasn't like, damn, when I saw him.

15:09.760 --> 15:14.560
When I saw, when I like maybe I became internet friends with them

15:14.560 --> 15:17.840
in freshman orientation and then you see them for the first time

15:17.840 --> 15:21.680
and you're like, God damn, Brody, you did great.

15:21.680 --> 15:23.040
You got it right.

15:23.040 --> 15:24.880
You did so good.

15:24.880 --> 15:28.560
So is the reverse of that theory that if there was a dad

15:28.560 --> 15:30.560
that was like super cool in high school,

15:30.560 --> 15:33.680
so much so that he felt all this pressure to be cool

15:33.680 --> 15:35.120
and behave the way that he did and he was like,

15:35.120 --> 15:37.840
you know what, I don't want my son to be that cool.

15:37.840 --> 15:38.080
No.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.600
I'm gonna name him Greedo.

15:39.600 --> 15:42.240
I'm gonna name him Bill.

15:42.240 --> 15:45.680
Have you guys ever met a Bill that you were like, oh shit.

15:45.680 --> 15:47.200
Is that short for William?

15:47.200 --> 15:47.600
No.

15:47.600 --> 15:47.920
No, it's not.

15:47.920 --> 15:49.280
It's short for Billium.

15:49.280 --> 15:51.120
It's standard Bill.

15:51.120 --> 15:54.320
It's like the vanilla Bill.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.440
Classic Bill.

15:55.440 --> 15:56.560
I'm Vabila.

15:56.560 --> 16:02.160
I think it's the inverse of the boy named Sue sort of strategy

16:02.160 --> 16:06.560
where rather than having a less tough sounding name

16:06.560 --> 16:10.480
that like crafts them into like a dynamic person,

16:10.480 --> 16:13.680
what you're doing is like giving them a lifetime

16:13.680 --> 16:15.680
of trying to live up to Riker.

16:16.320 --> 16:18.480
Like they're just never gonna hit it.

16:18.480 --> 16:20.080
They're gonna constantly fall short.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.160
Y'all are dipping into some nerd ass shit

16:22.160 --> 16:23.440
for your recommendations.

16:23.440 --> 16:27.040
And I hope you understand that if a child is named Riker

16:27.040 --> 16:29.920
or Ender or fucking lightsaber,

16:29.920 --> 16:34.800
they're not gonna end up like a fucking Maurice.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.080
You guys understand that yet?

16:36.080 --> 16:37.600
Well, Maurice is probably not great.

16:38.560 --> 16:38.960
Drake.

16:38.960 --> 16:40.160
Don't go with Maurice.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.200
I like Maurice.

16:41.920 --> 16:45.200
I do too, but that's not like a standard like,

16:45.200 --> 16:46.400
oh, that's a good looking guy.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.920
I bet just based on the name.

16:47.920 --> 16:49.840
Oh, you're saying it's just not a hot guy name.

16:49.840 --> 16:50.560
Not a hot guy name.

16:50.560 --> 16:52.320
It's a subversive guy name.

16:52.320 --> 16:56.400
I think you need a name that can evolve and change

16:56.960 --> 17:00.080
as you get more or less physically beautiful.

17:00.080 --> 17:04.240
Like if you, maybe you're Brodeus

17:04.240 --> 17:05.840
when you're like a little,

17:05.840 --> 17:07.840
you let yourself go a little bit.

17:07.840 --> 17:09.120
You got some punch.

17:09.120 --> 17:13.360
You're saying Brodeus is what happens.

17:13.360 --> 17:15.440
Brodeus is like your full,

17:15.440 --> 17:18.560
that's like someone says, hey Brody.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.800
I don't deserve to be called Brody right now.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.280
I haven't seen the inside of a gym for three months.

17:23.280 --> 17:24.560
I am not Brody.

17:24.560 --> 17:27.600
That's your sweatpants name is what you're saying.

17:27.600 --> 17:31.200
That's your cookie pants name is Brodeus.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.920
So that intimates that my entire life,

17:33.920 --> 17:37.920
my cookie pants name has been Griffin Andrew McElroy

17:37.920 --> 17:40.720
and that someday I'll get totally blasted

17:40.720 --> 17:41.200
and I'll be-

17:42.080 --> 17:42.580
Grifter.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.520
Grifter with five Y's in the middle.

17:45.520 --> 17:51.040
Yep, I am worried that when you two have boy babies,

17:51.680 --> 17:54.640
you're gonna like dip into this bizarre well

17:55.360 --> 17:59.120
of like hacker names,

17:59.120 --> 18:04.000
like weird cyberpunk names like Grifter with four Y's.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Deslin with three Y's.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.200
Deslin with three Y's and a zero and a one in there together.

18:10.720 --> 18:13.600
We asked all of you for follow ups

18:13.600 --> 18:17.840
if you gave us a question, we answered it

18:17.840 --> 18:20.080
and you did or did not follow our advice.

18:20.080 --> 18:21.280
We wanted to hear about it.

18:23.200 --> 18:26.800
Don't let this segment make you think

18:26.800 --> 18:28.320
we've changed our mind about you

18:28.320 --> 18:30.080
not doing the things we tell you to do

18:30.080 --> 18:31.840
because you still definitely don't.

18:33.840 --> 18:34.960
That definitely not.

18:35.600 --> 18:36.960
So let's check in with a few of these.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.800
Travis didn't really call them down to the good ones

18:41.440 --> 18:43.040
so we'll just take a shot.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.640
They're all good in their own special way.

18:46.320 --> 18:47.520
You answered two of my questions

18:47.520 --> 18:50.000
but I only took your advice on one because I'm lazy.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.160
In episode 159, you answered my question

18:52.160 --> 18:55.360
about apologizing to a friend about dating her ex.

18:55.360 --> 18:57.120
My cover name was Monster Engine.

18:57.920 --> 18:59.520
That's a great cover name.

18:59.520 --> 19:00.720
Good cover name.

19:00.720 --> 19:03.920
I decided to take Travis's advice of Envino Veritas

19:03.920 --> 19:05.040
and got drunk with her.

19:05.040 --> 19:05.920
What of all?

19:07.040 --> 19:08.160
What were we doing?

19:08.160 --> 19:10.880
Well, sorry, what the fuck was Travis doing?

19:10.880 --> 19:14.160
It did not devolve into Envino Punchitas, fortunately.

19:14.160 --> 19:17.040
We laughed about it and she forgave me entirely.

19:17.040 --> 19:18.240
In fact, she is now a listener

19:18.240 --> 19:19.680
of your hilarious and amazing show.

19:20.480 --> 19:22.320
You guys also read a Jumbotron from me

19:22.320 --> 19:26.320
and my boyfriend Eric in episode 183, which is fantastic.

19:26.320 --> 19:28.080
It was only a month after our anniversary

19:28.080 --> 19:29.680
so don't sweat the fuck up.

19:29.680 --> 19:31.520
Don't worry, I wasn't.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.280
That is good to hear.

19:35.280 --> 19:37.280
I'm glad that that panned out okay for you.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.680
I like this one specifically

19:39.680 --> 19:41.840
because I cannot remember what we talked about,

19:41.840 --> 19:42.720
but it's this.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.160
Hey brothers, you answered my question

19:44.160 --> 19:47.360
on episode 104 concerning song choice at karaoke.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.920
After your suggestions of don't choose a downer,

19:49.920 --> 19:52.240
something good but would claim to like ironically

19:52.240 --> 19:54.880
and smack my rep dick on the mic.

19:54.880 --> 19:57.760
We didn't say, we would never.

19:57.760 --> 20:00.560
I ended up choosing Some Like It Hot by the Power Station.

20:00.560 --> 20:03.360
It was a hit that ended up getting people clapping

20:03.360 --> 20:04.160
to the beat.

20:04.160 --> 20:06.000
Unfortunately, I did not get the chance

20:06.000 --> 20:07.440
to throw the goods around

20:07.440 --> 20:09.920
but I'm sure it would have earned a standing ovation.

20:09.920 --> 20:10.800
Thanks for the help,

20:10.800 --> 20:13.280
the artist formerly known as Thunderwaffle.

20:13.280 --> 20:13.920
It's pretty good.

20:15.920 --> 20:18.880
We couldn't have said don't put your dick on something.

20:18.880 --> 20:19.920
That doesn't sound like us.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.520
That doesn't sound like us.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.760
We're very conservative with dick exposure.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.240
Somebody put together this incredible video

20:26.240 --> 20:29.360
of all of the final questions that we've done

20:29.360 --> 20:32.240
throughout like the history of our show for four years.

20:32.240 --> 20:33.680
It was an immense labor.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.400
Yeah, it's like an hour long or something, it's crazy.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.760
It's a lot.

20:37.760 --> 20:39.280
And I listened to all of it

20:40.320 --> 20:43.680
and I didn't remember anything before.

20:43.680 --> 20:45.520
No kidding, 196.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.080
Every so often I see like NBNBA and Wisdom

20:50.080 --> 20:51.840
will tweet like a quote from the show

20:51.840 --> 20:53.920
where I go, who said that?

20:53.920 --> 20:55.040
Oh, it was me.

20:55.040 --> 20:55.760
Okay, cool.

20:55.760 --> 20:57.440
It was me three and a half years ago.

20:57.440 --> 20:58.160
Weird.

20:58.160 --> 20:59.920
And then there's some despicable things

20:59.920 --> 21:01.680
that come from NBNBA and Wisdom.

21:01.680 --> 21:03.440
I think, oh no, who said that?

21:03.440 --> 21:04.400
That was very naughty.

21:04.400 --> 21:05.200
Yikes.

21:05.200 --> 21:06.480
Those are very bad boys.

21:06.480 --> 21:09.840
They have maybe gotten some more progressive views

21:09.840 --> 21:11.040
about a couple of things

21:11.040 --> 21:13.200
and learned a few things about how to be sensitive

21:13.200 --> 21:13.840
and in the world.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.680
Maybe since they said that, maybe they don't know that.

21:18.800 --> 21:19.520
Maybe.

21:19.520 --> 21:19.840
Yes.

21:21.600 --> 21:24.720
Sure has been a good 200 episodes.

21:24.720 --> 21:27.520
It's been a great 200 episodes and growing.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.080
Humiliation.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.040
Oh, the growing.

21:30.160 --> 21:30.800
Here's another one.

21:30.800 --> 21:34.000
Petting zoo boyfriend here from episode 162.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.280
My lady and I decided to just have a kid

21:37.280 --> 21:39.040
so we could take her to the petting zoo.

21:39.040 --> 21:39.920
Follow-up question.

21:39.920 --> 21:42.160
How old does she have to be to go to the petting zoo?

21:42.160 --> 21:44.720
She's about three months old by the time you read this.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.400
Don't question the numbers, Travis.

21:46.400 --> 21:49.280
That's Zany and Zaftik at the zoo.

21:50.960 --> 21:52.320
That's Bathroom Monster, right?

21:52.320 --> 21:53.600
This child is Bathroom Monster?

21:53.600 --> 21:54.800
That was, yeah, absolutely.

21:54.800 --> 21:55.300
Right.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.360
Is that the same one that like,

21:57.360 --> 21:58.880
you know what, we get a lot of questions like this.

21:58.880 --> 22:03.440
It reminds me of the guy who got a lot of tickets

22:03.440 --> 22:04.880
at like the showbiz pizza

22:05.440 --> 22:10.560
and didn't know if he could hand them off to kids safely.

22:10.560 --> 22:12.320
I'd like to hear from that person.

22:12.320 --> 22:13.840
Kids are tricky, guys.

22:13.840 --> 22:15.200
We get a lot of questions

22:16.240 --> 22:17.600
that are from people worried

22:17.600 --> 22:19.200
about looking like child abductors.

22:20.560 --> 22:22.400
I feel like this is a very common issue

22:22.400 --> 22:23.840
plaguing today's young people.

22:24.560 --> 22:25.600
Or today's old people.

22:26.400 --> 22:27.760
Or today's people.

22:27.760 --> 22:29.280
Just like take a child.

22:29.920 --> 22:32.000
I actually have been struggling with this

22:32.000 --> 22:34.080
now that I have a kid on the way.

22:35.680 --> 22:38.160
I want the child to experience everything.

22:38.160 --> 22:41.200
I want to show them the world shining, shimmering, splendid.

22:41.200 --> 22:44.720
But I want them to appreciate it when I go.

22:44.720 --> 22:47.520
If I'm gonna lay out the money to do the Disney thing,

22:47.520 --> 22:50.000
I gotta know that they're gonna be forging childhood memories

22:50.000 --> 22:53.360
and not some vague, hazy, you know,

22:53.360 --> 22:55.520
recall of a man in a mouse suit.

22:55.520 --> 22:56.240
I can't have that.

22:56.240 --> 22:58.000
It's gotta be crystallized memories.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.800
But this puts me in an unenviable position of like,

23:00.800 --> 23:04.320
so am I just not supposed to do anything good for five years?

23:04.320 --> 23:05.680
Am I just supposed to stall

23:05.680 --> 23:07.680
and wait till the kid is forming like

23:07.680 --> 23:09.920
really great crystallized memories?

23:10.640 --> 23:11.680
I don't know what to do with them.

23:11.680 --> 23:13.600
I don't want to waste a bunch of time and energy

23:13.600 --> 23:14.880
if the kid's not gonna remember everything.

23:14.880 --> 23:16.480
Let me throw this out, Justin.

23:16.480 --> 23:16.980
Okay.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.160
Tell the kid that you went to Disney World

23:20.160 --> 23:21.360
with them when they were three.

23:21.920 --> 23:22.160
Yeah.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.120
So when they're like seven,

23:23.120 --> 23:24.320
they're like, I want to go to Disney World.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.360
You've already been there.

23:25.360 --> 23:25.920
Don't you remember?

23:25.920 --> 23:27.840
We just took you there for years.

23:27.840 --> 23:28.400
You just went.

23:28.400 --> 23:29.600
We were just there.

23:29.600 --> 23:32.080
We just got back in 2007.

23:34.480 --> 23:36.640
I sent you a question for episode 108

23:36.640 --> 23:39.440
about getting my sexy so right as a gamer.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.640
You told me to get super fit, dress classy,

23:42.640 --> 23:44.960
and not give any fucks about what people think about my gaming.

23:44.960 --> 23:47.680
Well, since then, I've lost 10 pounds,

23:47.680 --> 23:49.840
completed two half marathons,

23:49.840 --> 23:52.160
and greatly improved my wardrobe.

23:52.160 --> 23:53.680
Best of all, about a year after I wrote it,

23:53.680 --> 23:55.040
I met my super wonderful girlfriend

23:55.040 --> 23:56.720
who's as into games as I am.

23:56.720 --> 23:58.400
Lately, we've been marathoning through this-

23:58.400 --> 24:00.720
All right, man, I don't need to know everything.

24:02.160 --> 24:05.520
We don't need to know about your perverse sexual habits.

24:05.520 --> 24:06.880
I lost interest.

24:06.880 --> 24:10.000
I lost interest when it stopped being about how great we are.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.680
But I introduced you to the show,

24:11.680 --> 24:12.800
and now we listen every week.

24:12.800 --> 24:13.440
Oh, thank you.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.760
Thank you for the wonderful help and support over the years.

24:15.760 --> 24:19.280
That's from formerly digitally distraught in Davis.

24:19.280 --> 24:20.640
108.

24:20.640 --> 24:22.160
That was 92 episodes ago.

24:22.160 --> 24:22.560
That's insane.

24:22.560 --> 24:23.760
I'm just gonna throw this out.

24:23.760 --> 24:26.560
If I run two half marathons in my life,

24:26.560 --> 24:28.640
I tell people I ran a whole marathon.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.920
But using that logic, Travis,

24:35.920 --> 24:40.240
and I can say that I've probably run like 80 marathons just-

24:40.240 --> 24:41.760
I take a hefty break.

24:41.760 --> 24:45.040
Just with the cumulative total of walking,

24:45.040 --> 24:46.800
of perambulating that I've done.

24:46.800 --> 24:48.240
You ran a whole marathon?

24:48.240 --> 24:48.720
Yeah.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.240
Yeah, I ran half of it,

24:50.800 --> 24:52.080
and I had to catch my breath.

24:52.880 --> 24:54.000
For two and a half years.

24:54.000 --> 24:54.480
For two and a half years.

24:54.480 --> 24:56.000
I didn't really think about what it meant

24:56.000 --> 24:57.440
to complete the marathon.

24:57.440 --> 25:00.640
And then I didn't want to overexert myself,

25:00.640 --> 25:01.600
so I took a break.

25:02.240 --> 25:03.600
I finished it later.

25:03.600 --> 25:04.800
I don't think they let you do that.

25:04.800 --> 25:07.440
You come back to the same marathon two years later.

25:07.440 --> 25:08.880
No, I paid last time.

25:08.880 --> 25:10.880
No, no, I'm gonna start up there

25:10.880 --> 25:12.480
because it's where I got last time.

25:12.480 --> 25:13.360
Is that cool?

25:13.360 --> 25:16.160
Just come stumbling out for the woods with a giant beard

25:16.160 --> 25:17.520
and you're same numbered outfit.

25:17.520 --> 25:18.880
Where have I been?

25:18.880 --> 25:20.400
Okay, I'm coming in with you guys.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.600
I wrote in two to three years ago,

25:23.600 --> 25:26.480
worried about being taken seriously by my employees.

25:26.480 --> 25:27.680
Justin laid down some wisdom

25:27.680 --> 25:29.600
about being lavish with my affirmation

25:29.600 --> 25:31.040
or something mushy like that.

25:31.040 --> 25:32.080
And then the advice wound up

25:32.080 --> 25:33.920
including something about a rubber baby, I think.

25:35.360 --> 25:36.080
Sounds about right.

25:36.640 --> 25:38.800
Post advice, I actually did try to be more positive

25:38.800 --> 25:39.920
with my employees.

25:39.920 --> 25:41.200
This was to no avail, all right?

25:43.600 --> 25:44.080
Listen.

25:44.080 --> 25:45.760
Win some, lose some.

25:45.760 --> 25:46.720
The situation actually got-

25:46.720 --> 25:48.000
Poe Buddy's Nerfick, baby.

25:50.480 --> 25:52.480
The situation actually got really bad.

25:52.480 --> 25:55.360
The employees threw things at me.

25:55.360 --> 25:55.920
Cool, cool.

25:56.640 --> 25:58.480
There are all sorts of racially insensitive

25:58.480 --> 25:59.840
and otherwise inappropriate language.

25:59.840 --> 26:00.240
Yikes.

26:00.240 --> 26:01.920
Directed physical intimidation.

26:01.920 --> 26:03.520
And these people were older than my parents

26:03.520 --> 26:04.320
and acting like this.

26:04.320 --> 26:06.160
So I quit and went to grad school.

26:06.160 --> 26:07.280
I graduate next week

26:07.280 --> 26:09.600
and will be working as an individual contributor

26:09.600 --> 26:10.960
in a more professional environment.

26:10.960 --> 26:13.280
It would be hard to find a less professional environment.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.800
They do let us off the hook and say,

26:14.800 --> 26:16.320
I'm not sure any advice could have saved me

26:16.320 --> 26:17.920
from the situation I was in.

26:17.920 --> 26:18.240
Thanks.

26:18.800 --> 26:20.000
Thanks for that, I guess.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.600
I'm glad we could make it so bad

26:21.600 --> 26:22.400
you had to get out.

26:22.400 --> 26:23.280
That was our plan all along.

26:23.280 --> 26:24.000
That was our plan.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.800
Listen, we knew you were in an unwinnable game.

26:26.800 --> 26:27.040
Yeah.

26:28.080 --> 26:29.600
So we set into motion-

26:29.600 --> 26:31.280
The only way to win an unwinnable game

26:31.280 --> 26:32.640
is to change the rules.

26:32.640 --> 26:33.440
Or quit playing.

26:33.440 --> 26:34.800
Kobayashi Maru.

26:34.800 --> 26:37.200
Find a different game that's not Kobayashi Maru.

26:37.200 --> 26:38.960
Or find an easier game.

26:38.960 --> 26:41.120
Kobayashi Maru's a hot guy name.

26:41.120 --> 26:41.360
Yeah.

26:42.800 --> 26:43.120
That's what-

26:43.120 --> 26:44.160
It sounds like two kids.

26:44.160 --> 26:46.240
This is my son Kobayashi and Maru.

26:46.240 --> 26:48.160
That's what Kobe Bryant's full name is.

26:48.160 --> 26:50.160
Listen, Travis just said that

26:50.160 --> 26:52.480
and then one of you fuckos out there just went,

26:52.480 --> 26:52.800
Uh-huh.

26:53.440 --> 26:53.840
Hello.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.440
Let me jot this down.

26:55.440 --> 26:56.080
Dear diary.

26:56.080 --> 26:57.760
Then Kobayashi and Maru.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.520
Maru is actually would not be a bad person.

27:01.520 --> 27:02.080
Anyway.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.440
Especially their twins.

27:03.440 --> 27:05.680
You guys discussed various social dynamics

27:05.680 --> 27:08.720
of hugging vis-a-vis friend groups.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.800
But what if you're in a situation

27:10.800 --> 27:12.640
where you want to hug some of the people in the group

27:12.640 --> 27:13.600
but not all of them?

27:14.160 --> 27:16.000
I hang out with a group of friends on the reg

27:16.000 --> 27:18.160
and mostly I don't see those people

27:18.160 --> 27:19.600
outside the group situations.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.200
I like everyone but I'm kind of picky

27:21.200 --> 27:22.880
who I let in my touch bubble.

27:22.880 --> 27:23.040
And-

27:23.840 --> 27:25.520
Touch bubble would be a good name for a kid.

27:25.520 --> 27:26.160
Yeah.

27:26.160 --> 27:27.440
That's a hot guy name.

27:27.440 --> 27:29.200
This season on Survivor,

27:29.200 --> 27:30.320
Hey, I'm touch bubble.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.600
Hey ladies, touch bubble here.

27:33.600 --> 27:35.920
So hot to handle, too cold to hold.

27:35.920 --> 27:38.080
Because he's got a very small touch bubble.

27:41.680 --> 27:44.720
And only some of the people in this group qualify.

27:44.720 --> 27:46.160
I want to hug them.

27:46.160 --> 27:47.040
But I don't-

27:47.040 --> 27:48.160
Because I don't see them much.

27:48.160 --> 27:50.960
Otherwise, I don't want to make the non-huggables feel bad.

27:50.960 --> 27:53.760
Is there a way to negotiate this smoothly?

27:53.760 --> 27:54.480
I need a hug.

27:54.480 --> 27:54.880
That's from-

27:54.880 --> 27:56.080
I need a hug but not from you.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.640
Oh, that's so tricky.

27:58.640 --> 28:00.000
It's so true.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.160
You've got to start thinking like a velociraptor.

28:04.160 --> 28:06.640
You have to separate the group.

28:06.640 --> 28:09.040
You have to lead one off from the herd.

28:09.040 --> 28:11.360
Hey Dylan, could you step in the bedroom with me?

28:11.360 --> 28:12.320
I just want to hug you in private.

28:12.320 --> 28:13.360
Well, not the bedroom.

28:13.360 --> 28:16.160
If you're going to conduct a secret-

28:16.160 --> 28:17.600
Will you step in the laundry room with me?

28:17.600 --> 28:18.560
Secret hug business.

28:18.560 --> 28:19.440
Physical, intimate act.

28:19.440 --> 28:19.920
Yeah.

28:19.920 --> 28:20.960
You don't do the bedroom.

28:20.960 --> 28:21.520
You cannot-

28:21.520 --> 28:23.280
Will you step into my hug panic room, please?

28:24.720 --> 28:28.000
You cannot bust your touch bubble in the bedroom.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.520
It is inappropriate.

28:29.520 --> 28:30.800
I'm saying just weed them off.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.960
Maybe it's just like a line of sight thing.

28:33.520 --> 28:38.720
Where you come up from behind while the rest of the group is watching, you know, Eurovision

28:38.720 --> 28:40.960
or something, and then you hug them.

28:40.960 --> 28:42.160
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick!

28:42.160 --> 28:43.200
Quick, now, now, now!

28:43.200 --> 28:44.320
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

28:44.320 --> 28:47.600
Well, you can't fucking rush it is the problem.

28:47.600 --> 28:53.760
You can't dip in their stealth and then bust that bubble and then get out in like half

28:53.760 --> 28:56.320
a second, because that's going to be a shitty ass hug.

28:56.320 --> 28:57.760
You need to get a full embrace.

28:57.760 --> 28:59.120
You need to go chin to shoulder.

28:59.840 --> 29:01.040
Can I throw this out?

29:01.680 --> 29:04.560
This is the third time you said throw this out.

29:04.560 --> 29:05.600
You've got to get-

29:05.600 --> 29:06.320
Just do it.

29:06.320 --> 29:07.440
Be more confident.

29:07.440 --> 29:08.560
Let me interject this.

29:08.560 --> 29:08.800
Okay.

29:10.080 --> 29:12.240
Please allow me to insert this into the conversation.

29:12.240 --> 29:14.960
Excuse me while I whip this out.

29:14.960 --> 29:20.880
What if you just fucking do it and you look the unhuggables dead in the eye, and then

29:20.880 --> 29:23.200
when Deborah's like, hey, how come we never hug?

29:23.200 --> 29:26.720
Say, hey, remember that time when I tried to tell you about my meanwhile surgery and

29:26.720 --> 29:27.840
you kind of cold-shouldered me?

29:29.360 --> 29:30.240
That's why.

29:30.240 --> 29:36.400
Or, or, while you're giving this other person a deep, deep chin to shoulder hug, you make

29:36.400 --> 29:44.400
eye contact with the unhuggables and you whisper, unhuggable, just to really let them know where

29:44.400 --> 29:44.960
they stay.

29:44.960 --> 29:45.440
I get it.

29:45.440 --> 29:49.440
Like this happens a lot when like we'll go on these overnight trips with a big group

29:49.440 --> 29:52.240
of friends and maybe we're standing at a lake house and just like bonding.

29:52.240 --> 29:53.920
Oh, the tightest bonding.

29:53.920 --> 29:57.360
Bonfire secrets and lakeside memories.

29:57.360 --> 30:00.480
And then at the end, everybody's going their separate ways and you get that little bit

30:00.480 --> 30:03.600
of summer camp tinge of like, ah, I'm going to miss you fools because we're not going

30:03.600 --> 30:05.360
to hang out constantly like we did this weekend.

30:05.360 --> 30:06.640
You start hugging everyone.

30:06.640 --> 30:13.680
And then there's like, and then there's blaze that like your buddy works with who he brought

30:13.680 --> 30:18.720
and he's fine, but like you haven't known him long enough to get those lakeside memories

30:18.720 --> 30:20.080
going with blaze quite yet.

30:20.080 --> 30:24.880
Like the only awkward time for the entire weekend was when you and blaze found yourself

30:24.880 --> 30:27.280
making pop darts at the same time in the kitchen.

30:27.280 --> 30:27.760
It was only the two of you.

30:27.760 --> 30:28.240
Hey, man.

30:28.240 --> 30:28.800
Hey.

30:28.800 --> 30:29.120
Hey.

30:29.120 --> 30:29.600
Hey.

30:29.600 --> 30:30.720
Hey, pop darts.

30:30.720 --> 30:31.040
You having a good time?

30:31.040 --> 30:31.600
So silly, right?

30:31.600 --> 30:31.840
Yeah.

30:32.960 --> 30:33.760
Toaster pastry.

30:33.760 --> 30:34.400
Who knew?

30:34.400 --> 30:35.600
Kyle seems cool.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.120
Yeah, Kyle is pretty cool.

30:37.120 --> 30:38.560
I've known him my whole life.

30:38.560 --> 30:39.680
Blaze, who are you?

30:39.680 --> 30:40.240
What are you?

30:41.840 --> 30:42.720
Interloper.

30:44.800 --> 30:48.560
I find myself in this situation with surprising frequency and I just do it.

30:48.560 --> 30:49.280
Just hug them.

30:49.280 --> 30:49.680
Whatever.

30:50.400 --> 30:50.960
Just hug them.

30:51.680 --> 30:52.240
Just hug them.

30:53.200 --> 30:54.160
You're not going to start.

30:54.160 --> 30:56.320
You have to start hugging blaze sometime.

30:56.320 --> 30:57.840
You're going, listen, you're going to hug blaze.

30:57.840 --> 31:01.440
That'll make it all the more special because like blaze sees you hugging everybody else.

31:01.440 --> 31:04.720
And then one day seven trips in, you hug blaze and blaze is like, I'm in.

31:04.720 --> 31:08.960
Have you ever, have either of you ever met somebody who is like a friend of a friend

31:08.960 --> 31:12.000
who like all of your other friends know and you just haven't met yet.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.320
And then they come up to you and they say, oh, hey.

31:14.320 --> 31:17.360
And then they just go in immediately, immediately from the jump.

31:17.360 --> 31:20.320
Yes, that person is named Travis Patrick Mackerel.

31:20.320 --> 31:20.880
Okay.

31:20.880 --> 31:25.520
But like outside of yourself, have you met a person like that?

31:25.520 --> 31:28.800
And then not immediately been like, oh, I like that blaze.

31:30.080 --> 31:30.640
You know what I mean?

31:30.640 --> 31:34.560
Like they go, they just fucking go for it from the jump and it lets you know, like,

31:34.560 --> 31:36.960
I can feel comfortable with this person.

31:36.960 --> 31:40.720
I can feel comfortable getting to know this person because they're very warm, very inviting.

31:40.720 --> 31:44.720
They go full blown chin to shoulder, guaranteed a hundred percent of the time.

31:44.720 --> 31:48.080
What everybody wanted at the end of the day is to be liked, you know?

31:48.080 --> 31:52.400
And I think that if you can give off that vibe that you like the person you're interacting with,

31:52.400 --> 31:56.000
it doesn't take forever to build a relationship or a rapport.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.440
People really respond to that.

31:57.440 --> 31:59.680
So just go in for the hug.

31:59.680 --> 32:04.000
What I like about it is it kind of skips a lot of awkwardness by saying like,

32:04.000 --> 32:08.320
hey, even if we're faking it, we can be comfortable around each other.

32:08.320 --> 32:11.920
Like we're, you know, like let's pretend like we've known each other forever

32:11.920 --> 32:14.320
and just skip past all the shit where you don't know me.

32:14.320 --> 32:15.120
Skip the shit.

32:15.120 --> 32:18.080
There's a lot of shit in getting to know somebody.

32:18.080 --> 32:21.520
And it's this, it's this shit of are we hugging friends yet?

32:21.520 --> 32:22.160
Fuck that.

32:22.160 --> 32:24.000
Just hug that creep.

32:24.000 --> 32:24.720
I'm hungry.

32:25.600 --> 32:28.640
Is your I'm hungry trying to get in the money zone?

32:28.640 --> 32:29.120
Yeah.

32:29.120 --> 32:29.620
Okay.

32:30.400 --> 32:31.520
Teach me how to snacky.

32:33.040 --> 32:33.920
I don't know what you mean.

32:35.440 --> 32:36.960
You haven't said money zone yet.

32:37.600 --> 32:38.480
Money zone.

32:38.480 --> 32:38.980
Okay.

32:39.840 --> 32:42.720
Kind of giving away what the contents of the money zone is.

32:44.480 --> 32:46.400
I know a little preview taste for the audience.

32:46.400 --> 32:48.800
Here's a little sneak sneak taste.

32:48.800 --> 32:49.680
Snack sneak.

32:49.680 --> 33:03.920
It's going to, it will involve snacking.

33:03.920 --> 33:05.200
You slide to the left.

33:06.080 --> 33:07.760
That's not what that is.

33:07.760 --> 33:08.320
No, that's it.

33:08.320 --> 33:12.800
You slide to the left and then you get on www.naturebox.com

33:12.800 --> 33:16.000
because you remember that you left your computer slightly to the left.

33:16.000 --> 33:16.880
Just out of reach.

33:16.880 --> 33:18.080
What do I do once I'm there, Jeff?

33:18.080 --> 33:21.200
What do you do once you go to www.naturebox.com?

33:21.200 --> 33:21.840
Yes.

33:21.840 --> 33:23.600
You're going to start snacking smarter.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.680
Well, not eating all that bullshit.

33:25.680 --> 33:26.560
Not instantly.

33:26.560 --> 33:26.960
It's not.

33:26.960 --> 33:30.160
You click on the website and then you have, there are snacks in your mouth.

33:30.160 --> 33:31.920
Griffin, do you know what makes the best sauce?

33:31.920 --> 33:32.400
What does?

33:32.400 --> 33:50.160
Worcestershire.

33:50.160 --> 33:51.600
You dumb piece of shit.

33:56.720 --> 34:00.320
For a second, I thought you were talking about a food product

34:00.320 --> 34:02.720
on the nature box website.

34:05.360 --> 34:05.600
Okay.

34:07.280 --> 34:08.720
So you click on the website.

34:08.720 --> 34:10.320
You immediately have food in your mouth.

34:10.320 --> 34:11.440
What else do you have to do?

34:13.680 --> 34:16.160
You got to choose the snacks you want.

34:16.160 --> 34:18.640
They got BBQ kettle kernels.

34:18.640 --> 34:19.600
They got everything.

34:19.600 --> 34:20.400
Bagel sticks.

34:20.400 --> 34:24.240
I heard there's some stuff with seaweed that's pretty good on Twitter.

34:24.240 --> 34:25.760
Somebody told us that.

34:25.760 --> 34:28.000
The South Pacific plantain chips.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.880
There's over a hundred more.

34:30.880 --> 34:31.680
There's a ton of stacks.

34:31.680 --> 34:35.760
They're all like healthy enough trans fat or high for just corn syrup.

34:35.760 --> 34:39.760
And they're not genetically modified or any of that garbage.

34:39.760 --> 34:41.520
They're just healthy and good for you.

34:41.520 --> 34:42.320
And they're cheap.

Thank you nature box for sponsoring our program.

35:14.800 --> 35:15.280

35:15.280 --> 35:18.560
And thank you to Squarespace who's also supporting my brother, my brother, me.

35:18.560 --> 35:23.520
It's the all in one platform that makes it super fast and super easy to make your

35:23.520 --> 35:26.320
own professional website or online portfolio.

35:27.760 --> 35:28.960
They got updates.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.560
You thought you knew Squarespace.

35:30.560 --> 35:32.000
You don't know shit.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.040
Shut your mouth.

35:33.040 --> 35:34.160
It's uninformed.

35:34.720 --> 35:37.040
They got beautiful designs you can start with.

35:37.040 --> 35:38.480
You can start from scratch.

35:38.480 --> 35:40.000
They got style options.

35:40.880 --> 35:41.600
Whoa.

35:41.600 --> 35:42.160
Whoa.

35:42.160 --> 35:42.960
Style options.

35:42.960 --> 35:44.800
Nobody told me there'd be style options.

35:45.680 --> 35:48.160
Style options is a pretty hot name for a kid.

35:48.160 --> 35:50.880
It's like a hat for your website.

35:50.880 --> 35:54.720
And you put it on there and it's something new with the style options.

35:54.720 --> 35:55.760
It sounds pricey.

35:55.760 --> 35:56.880
It's not pricey.

35:58.480 --> 36:01.760
You understand that these people are paying us to talk about their awesome product.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.280
I'm not saying it sounds like it's going to be expensive.

36:03.280 --> 36:04.880
This sounds the worst.

36:04.880 --> 36:05.360
It's not.

36:05.360 --> 36:06.000
It's awesome.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.520
It's $8 a month.

36:07.520 --> 36:11.520
And that includes a free domain name if you sign up for a year, which is a steal.

36:12.400 --> 36:14.800
Justin has bought so many domain names.

36:14.800 --> 36:20.080
So maybe he can speak to like how much those cost normally for Fart Patrol.

36:20.080 --> 36:21.520
And what's the other one?

36:21.520 --> 36:23.120
What's the fartpatrol.com?

36:23.120 --> 36:24.400
You got the dot com on that one.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.000
What's the other one that you just bought?

36:26.000 --> 36:27.920
And fartpatrol.gov.

36:27.920 --> 36:29.760
I wish I had fartpatrol.gov.

36:29.760 --> 36:31.200
I cannot get that.

36:31.200 --> 36:33.520
The NSA actually has that, believe it or not.

36:33.520 --> 36:34.960
What is the other website?

36:34.960 --> 36:38.000
It was like the smoothest, smoothest, smoothest face.

36:38.000 --> 36:38.640
My smooth face.

36:38.640 --> 36:39.120
Hold on one second.

36:39.120 --> 36:39.600
I'll tell you.

36:40.160 --> 36:40.560
Let's see.

36:40.560 --> 36:43.440
I own fartpatrol.com.

36:43.440 --> 36:43.760
Yeah.

36:43.760 --> 36:45.360
griffinspacejam.com.

36:45.360 --> 36:46.480
You own that?

36:46.480 --> 36:46.800
Yeah.

36:47.360 --> 36:47.840
That's mine.

36:47.840 --> 36:52.560
Mysmoothface.com is what you're thinking of.

36:52.560 --> 36:53.440
We're going to get rid of that.

36:53.440 --> 36:55.200
We're going to sell that off for fucking...

36:55.760 --> 36:56.720
We'll retire.

36:56.720 --> 36:58.400
We will retire off My Smooth Face.

36:59.520 --> 37:04.960

My brother.

38:17.440 --> 38:20.160
Justin, are you listening to this album right now?

38:20.720 --> 38:22.400
I thought I'd lay it down underneath.

38:22.960 --> 38:23.360
Kind of like...

38:23.360 --> 38:23.600
Okay.

38:24.320 --> 38:25.440
Oh, I like this.

38:25.440 --> 38:26.240
Yeah, it's good, right?

38:26.800 --> 38:27.760
This is it work.

38:27.760 --> 38:28.320
Some dumpy...

38:28.320 --> 38:29.280
For Blue Circle.

38:29.280 --> 38:30.080
Dumpy bass.

38:30.880 --> 38:32.320
Leave it on the ground.

38:32.320 --> 38:34.000
Maybe he's going to sing here or should I sing?

38:35.680 --> 38:37.120
Let's play this over our next one.

38:37.120 --> 38:42.160
Turn the treble all the way up and turn everything else down because that's how I like to listen to

38:42.160 --> 38:42.560
the music.

38:44.560 --> 38:45.200
Oh, this is good.

38:45.200 --> 38:45.760
Okay.

38:45.760 --> 38:48.240
This is at thespencerohan.com.

38:48.240 --> 38:48.640
Okay.

38:48.640 --> 38:51.840
You understand that this is arguably the worst way to listen to music.

38:51.840 --> 38:52.880
We're not doing Spencer Ohan.

38:52.880 --> 38:53.840
I don't disagree.

38:53.840 --> 38:54.800
But like, what are we going to do?

38:54.800 --> 38:55.360
Edit it in?

38:58.320 --> 39:00.160
I have a message for Pizza Zach.

39:00.960 --> 39:03.200
And it's from Caramel.

39:04.000 --> 39:04.560
I love that.

39:04.560 --> 39:07.440
Uh, who says, happy belated birthday to my best friend.

39:07.440 --> 39:10.800
Hope you enjoy this birthday message because I couldn't think of anything else to get you

39:10.800 --> 39:12.240
that wasn't yoga clothes.

39:15.840 --> 39:16.960
Oh, Pizza Zach.

39:16.960 --> 39:18.880
Your interests are so single faceted.

39:20.240 --> 39:20.800
And who else?

39:20.800 --> 39:21.440
Do you know, Zach?

39:21.440 --> 39:22.560
He only likes two things.

39:22.560 --> 39:27.840
This podcast about hot guy names and pizza and yoga clothes.

39:27.840 --> 39:28.560
So three things.

39:29.120 --> 39:31.760
Oh, he eats the pizza while he does yoga.

39:31.760 --> 39:32.320
It's really fast.

39:32.320 --> 39:32.640
He eats pizza.

39:32.640 --> 39:33.840
That doesn't mean he likes it.

39:33.840 --> 39:37.600
If somebody invents a yoga that you do while eating pizza, they're going to be rich.

39:39.040 --> 39:43.440
And who else could help appropriately celebrate this milestone than the McElroy brothers themselves.

39:43.440 --> 39:44.960
So happy quarter of a century.

39:44.960 --> 39:46.880
And here's to getting it done in 20 forward.

39:46.880 --> 39:47.760
Hashtag blessed.

39:49.840 --> 39:54.400
I don't like thinking of my age as being above a quarter of a century.

39:54.400 --> 39:55.760
It bums me out in pretty big way.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.040
We're all dying.

39:57.040 --> 39:59.680
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.

40:00.480 --> 40:02.240
Hello, my name is Graham Clark.

40:02.240 --> 40:03.360
My name is Dave Shamka.

40:03.360 --> 40:06.560
Together we host a show called Stop Podcasting Yourself.

40:06.560 --> 40:07.520
We're from Canada.

40:08.560 --> 40:09.600
Don't hang up, don't hang up.

40:10.240 --> 40:15.120
And every week we're lucky enough to be joined by a guest, sometimes a comedian,

40:15.120 --> 40:19.840
or sometimes just somebody that we like and somebody probably you've never heard of.

40:20.800 --> 40:22.080
But trust us.

40:22.080 --> 40:26.240
If you followed us this far into the promo, just try it out, please.

40:27.360 --> 40:28.400
Do we sound too desperate?

40:29.600 --> 40:33.120
Stop podcasting yourself on maximumfun.org.

40:33.120 --> 40:34.560
Let's check in with somebody else.

40:35.520 --> 40:36.400
Who's also dying.

40:37.120 --> 40:37.680
Stop it.

40:38.880 --> 40:39.440
You're killing me.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Wait, pretend I said that.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.040
Pretend I said something else.

40:43.840 --> 40:47.360
I got advice from you in episode 130, Holy Terror.

40:47.360 --> 40:50.160
I wanted to send you an update for episode 200 check-ins.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.400
You understand that's check-ins, not check-ins.

40:54.400 --> 40:55.280
Hey, check-ins.

40:55.280 --> 40:56.960
Hey, I got a hot check-in for you.

40:56.960 --> 41:03.280
And I wrote in asking if it was okay to have a friend slash ex-girlfriend help me pick

41:03.280 --> 41:05.680
out a gift for a current girlfriend.

41:05.680 --> 41:11.600
I loosely followed the advice Travis gave me and had my friend who you dubbed Large Mark.

41:11.600 --> 41:13.680
Why would we do that?

41:14.320 --> 41:17.280
Note she is actually a petite Asian girl.

41:17.280 --> 41:20.560
Recommend some hip stores rather than a specific gift.

41:20.560 --> 41:23.360
And with that, I was able to pick out a nice gift myself.

41:23.360 --> 41:25.680
The present was a hit with my girlfriend.

41:25.680 --> 41:28.000
We are still dating to this day and very much in love.

41:28.000 --> 41:28.960
Because of that present.

41:29.520 --> 41:34.800
In addition, I got a chance to introduce my friend and my girlfriend, and they hit it

41:34.800 --> 41:36.160
off really well.

41:36.160 --> 41:40.160
I've been listening to the show since around episode 16, and I'm a max fund donor.

41:40.160 --> 41:40.960
Thanks for the great work.

41:40.960 --> 41:42.400
Looking forward to the next 100 episodes.

41:42.400 --> 41:43.040
Thanks again.

41:43.680 --> 41:45.760
Gift blind guy in Minneapolis.

41:45.760 --> 41:47.920
Okay, that one turned out really fucking well.

41:47.920 --> 41:49.280
That is incredible.

41:49.280 --> 41:50.320
You are welcome.

41:50.320 --> 41:52.160
So let me follow that up with this one.

41:52.160 --> 41:53.280
I'm hungry and awkward.

41:53.280 --> 41:56.960
The guy who wondered if his Chinese delivery guy was flirting by adding extra things in

41:56.960 --> 41:57.760
my order.

41:57.760 --> 42:01.440
I weighed the value of the food against the awkwardness of the situation and decided to

42:01.440 --> 42:03.200
say screw it and asked him out.

42:03.760 --> 42:04.400
Wasn't gay.

42:04.960 --> 42:07.040
He had no idea about the extra stuff.

42:07.040 --> 42:09.040
Turned out the dude was just a friendly guy.

42:09.040 --> 42:11.520
Luckily, it was a totally not awkward situation.

42:11.520 --> 42:15.440
We both laughed it off, and I'm still able to order my whole grilled fish and weird spicy

42:15.440 --> 42:16.720
sauce without problem.

42:16.720 --> 42:21.200
He even pointed out another dude who works there who was gay, but sadly that did not

42:21.200 --> 42:22.320
work out well.

42:22.320 --> 42:23.440
Satisfied and secure.

42:24.800 --> 42:26.800
Well, you're welcome.

42:26.800 --> 42:27.520
You're welcome.

42:27.520 --> 42:29.040
I mean, you definitely did.

42:29.040 --> 42:30.800
I'm almost certain.

42:30.800 --> 42:35.520
I don't remember this specific question, but I'm almost certain we would not tell anybody

42:35.520 --> 42:41.680
regardless of their gender or sexual preference to ask out a person that delivers food to

42:41.680 --> 42:42.560
them professionally.

42:44.080 --> 42:45.600
But I'm glad it didn't work out.

42:45.600 --> 42:48.480
I'm glad it didn't work out because we told you it wouldn't and didn't.

42:48.480 --> 42:49.120
Don't lie.

42:49.120 --> 42:50.400
Here's a good one.

42:50.400 --> 42:55.280
Back in episode 87, I asked you how to gain weight for a movie role and signed an irritatingly

42:55.280 --> 42:57.040
thin Portland hipster.

42:57.040 --> 43:01.520
I ate a ton of bread because that's what I could afford, and I gained 10 pounds.

43:01.520 --> 43:06.640
I did not, as Travis suggested, do a ton of squats to try to gain the weight all in my

43:06.640 --> 43:06.960
legs.

43:06.960 --> 43:07.760
That was a quote.

43:08.640 --> 43:10.240
Quote, all in my legs.

43:10.240 --> 43:13.680
But I still looked a little bigger, and it read well on camera.

43:13.680 --> 43:17.440
I'm now slightly less than LA Hipster, and the movie, A Tale of the Light, comes out

43:17.440 --> 43:19.440
on video on demand this month.

43:19.440 --> 43:20.400
Thanks, Brian.

43:20.400 --> 43:21.440
I'm glad that worked out for you.

43:21.440 --> 43:24.640
And the movie, Yum Yum Bread Boy, comes out on video on demand this month.

43:26.560 --> 43:28.960
Silly Billy the Bread King.

43:28.960 --> 43:32.400
And the movie, Johnny Huge Legs, comes out on video on demand this month.

43:33.120 --> 43:34.080
Can't wait to catch it.

43:35.040 --> 43:35.840
This is great.

43:36.480 --> 43:40.800
Writing a follow up on advice given about my friend's fantasy football league I had

43:40.800 --> 43:42.640
been forcibly drafted into.

43:42.640 --> 43:44.080
Your advice was threefold.

43:44.080 --> 43:45.520
One, get out of the league.

43:45.520 --> 43:47.120
Two, moneyball.

43:47.120 --> 43:49.440
Three, something about looking at players' teeth.

43:50.480 --> 43:54.400
Well, just wanted to let you know that my friend got in trouble at work and lost his

43:54.400 --> 43:57.920
internet privileges, so the league collapsed before it even began.

43:57.920 --> 44:00.720
Happy endings all around, thanks for the advice.

44:00.720 --> 44:02.720
That's from Sam from Lakewood.

44:02.720 --> 44:03.520
Wonderful.

44:03.520 --> 44:04.640
Wonderful.

44:04.640 --> 44:06.400
We solved another one, gang.

44:06.400 --> 44:12.480
We actually reported your league commissioner to his boss at work.

44:12.480 --> 44:14.480
That actually would have been a much better idea.

44:14.480 --> 44:17.520
I wish we had created that, because that would have been a great plan.

44:18.240 --> 44:19.920
Well, that's some Machiavellian shit.

44:19.920 --> 44:20.960
I don't think we could have...

44:20.960 --> 44:22.560
I don't think we're capable of generating...

44:22.560 --> 44:23.680
Sun Tzu nonsense.

44:23.680 --> 44:24.800
You must undo him.

44:26.160 --> 44:26.960
Y'all want Yahoo?

44:27.600 --> 44:27.920
Yep.

44:29.760 --> 44:31.840
This Yahoo was sent in by Campbell Bird.

44:31.840 --> 44:32.720
Thank you, Campbell.

44:32.720 --> 44:34.080
That's a great fucking name.

44:34.720 --> 44:36.240
That's a pretty hot guy name.

44:36.240 --> 44:36.800
Super hot.

44:38.320 --> 44:40.800
It's by Yahoo Answers user Liv who asks,

44:40.800 --> 44:43.840
"'How to command attention and have a presence?

44:45.280 --> 44:48.880
"'When I walk into a room, I want to look like I mean business.

44:49.600 --> 44:54.800
"'I want to have a thing about me that makes people look up and pay attention

44:54.800 --> 44:57.040
"'when I speak or walk into a room.

44:57.040 --> 45:00.400
"'I want tone like an unstoppable force.

45:00.400 --> 45:02.480
"'Is it something to with appearance...?'

45:03.280 --> 45:03.840
Oh, God.

45:03.840 --> 45:06.720
"'Is it something to with appearance, the clothes I wear?

45:06.720 --> 45:10.480
"'Something to do with how I present myself, posture, the way I dress,

45:10.480 --> 45:11.760
"'the way I talk, et cetera?

45:11.760 --> 45:12.800
"'Or the way I speak?

45:12.800 --> 45:14.960
"'I feel invisible when I walk into a room.

45:14.960 --> 45:16.480
"'Literally nobody notices me.

45:16.480 --> 45:17.760
"'How can I fix this?''

45:17.760 --> 45:19.280
You can wear a t-shirt that says swag.

45:19.840 --> 45:20.800
That's pretty good.

45:21.680 --> 45:22.880
I mean, it says it all.

45:22.880 --> 45:24.240
Not great for...

45:24.240 --> 45:24.800
Says it all.

45:25.360 --> 45:26.080
It does say...

45:27.040 --> 45:28.480
Who doesn't look good?

45:28.480 --> 45:32.800
Who doesn't command attention on a sweet t-shirt with simple type swag?

45:32.800 --> 45:34.560
I don't think I would look great in that, Travis.

45:35.360 --> 45:36.640
I think you would, Griffin.

45:36.640 --> 45:38.560
I think I might actually look pretty bad in that.

45:38.560 --> 45:40.640
Can you get a pallbearer?

45:40.640 --> 45:41.200
I'm sorry.

45:42.160 --> 45:44.480
Like the wrestler, not an actual...

45:44.480 --> 45:45.760
Oh, yes.

45:46.480 --> 45:47.440
You need a hype man.

45:49.520 --> 45:52.640
We're coming for you at Summer Slam, Hogan.

45:52.640 --> 45:54.560
Uh, I'm sorry.

45:54.560 --> 45:57.680
I asked if you wanted fries with your hamburger.

45:57.680 --> 45:59.040
We're coming for you.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.360
How about an animal mask?

46:02.480 --> 46:04.000
How about George the Animal Steel?

46:05.920 --> 46:07.360
What about Coco Beware?

46:07.360 --> 46:09.360
Can you get Coco Beware to follow you around?

46:11.280 --> 46:11.760
It's gotta-

46:11.760 --> 46:14.480
Justin, I feel like you're really thinking inside the box on this one.

46:15.040 --> 46:16.480
Yeah, I can't get myself out of the box.

46:16.480 --> 46:18.560
Give me the high points of the question again.

46:18.560 --> 46:20.240
How to command attention and have a presence.

46:20.240 --> 46:23.520
I want to look like I mean fucking business when I walk in a room.

46:23.520 --> 46:24.080
What is it?

46:24.080 --> 46:24.640
Posture?

46:24.640 --> 46:25.200
Clothes?

46:25.200 --> 46:26.400
How do I present myself?

46:26.400 --> 46:27.360
I'm invisible now.

46:28.400 --> 46:30.160
Sincerely, the invisible boy.

46:32.160 --> 46:33.760
How about you set your shoulders on fire?

46:34.560 --> 46:35.280
Like in what?

46:35.280 --> 46:36.160
Like in the Hunger Games.

46:36.160 --> 46:36.640
Like the-

46:36.640 --> 46:37.360
Like just, yeah.

46:37.360 --> 46:38.720
Just as you're about to walk in the room,

46:39.600 --> 46:40.880
set your shoulders on fire.

46:40.880 --> 46:42.160
Every time you walk in a room,

46:42.160 --> 46:44.960
be wearing a magic dress that Lenny Kravitz made you

46:44.960 --> 46:47.360
that when you spin around, it turns into fiery birds.

46:47.360 --> 46:50.400
I don't see why you're having such a hard fucking time with this.

46:50.400 --> 46:51.600
That's 101.

46:51.600 --> 46:52.480
That's 101.

46:52.480 --> 46:54.480
Lenny Kravitz will make you a magic dress.

46:55.040 --> 46:55.840
Call Lenny Kravitz.

46:55.840 --> 46:56.080
Call Lenny Kravitz.

46:56.080 --> 46:57.040
1-800-LENNY.

46:57.040 --> 46:57.200
1-800-LENNY.

46:57.200 --> 46:58.240
He's sitting by the phone.

46:58.240 --> 46:59.840
He's sitting by the phone, waiting for your call.

46:59.840 --> 47:02.240
He will make you a magic dress.

47:02.240 --> 47:03.760
Lenny Kravitz's are standing by.

47:03.760 --> 47:06.880
They're multiple Krav-I.

47:06.880 --> 47:08.240
They will make you fiery dresses.

47:10.000 --> 47:10.960
Wasting our time.

47:13.200 --> 47:14.880
Make sure it's a big room, though.

47:14.880 --> 47:17.600
Those fiery birds don't know where the fuck to go.

47:17.600 --> 47:18.720
They're made out of fire.

47:19.840 --> 47:22.960
Lenny Kravitz makes you promise to use it only outdoors.

47:22.960 --> 47:23.920
I'll give you this fiery dress-

47:23.920 --> 47:25.280
And only for good.

47:25.280 --> 47:26.400
I can't go back to jail, man.

47:26.400 --> 47:30.480
With fiery Lenny Kravitz dress comes great responsibility.

47:30.480 --> 47:33.840
Spider-Man 3 in theaters now took a couple liberties.

47:35.600 --> 47:36.880
Organic web shooters?

47:36.880 --> 47:37.600
What are webs?

47:37.600 --> 47:38.080
What are webs?

47:38.080 --> 47:38.560
There are no ends to this.

47:38.560 --> 47:39.920
What is a spider?

47:39.920 --> 47:42.320
Uncle Ben is Lenny Kravitz?

47:42.320 --> 47:44.240
That seems like you're retconning a little bit.

47:45.360 --> 47:48.160
Sally Field also Lenny Kravitz, huh?

47:48.160 --> 47:48.480
Okay.

47:49.120 --> 47:52.080
I don't remember there being so many fiery dresses or birds.

47:53.120 --> 47:54.720
Excelsior, I guess.

47:55.600 --> 47:57.200
Stanley is in it, though.

47:57.200 --> 47:59.680
He's the voice of one of the fiery birds.

47:59.680 --> 48:01.040
Hail, true believers.

48:01.040 --> 48:03.440
Look at my beautiful Lenny Kravitz dress.

48:04.160 --> 48:05.680
Sorry about your hair, lady.

48:06.240 --> 48:08.640
I set it on fire, Excelsior.

48:10.880 --> 48:14.320
I like how his uncle is named Ben

48:14.960 --> 48:17.520
as if we just forgot about that rice.

48:17.520 --> 48:17.760
Yeah.

48:18.560 --> 48:19.360
Same guy.

48:19.360 --> 48:20.400
Same guy.

48:20.400 --> 48:22.960
That's how Peter can afford to do all this science shit.

48:22.960 --> 48:23.600
Exactly.

48:23.600 --> 48:25.680
Guys, is it just confidence?

48:25.680 --> 48:26.960
Is that how you command shit?

48:26.960 --> 48:29.280
I don't know.

48:29.280 --> 48:33.280
I'm pretty confident, and I don't feel like I command anything yet.

48:34.400 --> 48:38.000
The problem is you're not hoving into enough people's field of view.

48:38.000 --> 48:42.880
If you stand in one place in a room, people only address you

48:42.880 --> 48:46.080
or are made aware of you when they're looking directly at you.

48:46.080 --> 48:53.360
You've got to get on the hustle to start getting in front of people more.

48:53.360 --> 48:57.840
What the fuck did you just say?

48:57.840 --> 49:01.040
I mean, you need to move throughout the room more

49:01.760 --> 49:04.640
so people have to address you more often.

49:05.200 --> 49:08.320
I want them to turn around and you're there again.

49:09.440 --> 49:15.280
Maybe with doing a very quiet, almost an audible techno beat under your breath

49:15.280 --> 49:19.440
as you chug a chug around the room to be in front of everybody all at once.

49:20.160 --> 49:22.240
Just oots, oots, oots, oots.

49:22.240 --> 49:26.240
You know Mysterio from the Spider-Man 3 movie?

49:30.000 --> 49:31.280
It seems like he could pull this off.

49:32.080 --> 49:35.680
It turns out that Mysterio was the one in charge of all the confusion

49:35.680 --> 49:37.520
and all the fiery bird dresses and stuff.

49:37.520 --> 49:40.080
It was a trick to make Spider-Man forget he was ever born.

49:42.720 --> 49:46.560
If you want more people to notice you, you just have to be in all places at once.

49:46.560 --> 49:51.760
You have to have a glass dome on your head like Mysterio.

49:52.480 --> 49:54.000
Allow me to leave you with this.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.920
Okay, leave us with something.

49:55.920 --> 50:00.560
Rather than asking people to look at you, dare them not to.

50:05.120 --> 50:06.000
Next question.

50:06.000 --> 50:06.800
What is that?

50:06.800 --> 50:10.240
No, no, no, no, no.

50:10.240 --> 50:14.640
Griffin, you seem very concrete about it being time for the next question.

50:14.640 --> 50:17.440
I'm sorry, but when Travis uses that voice, I have to comply.

50:18.480 --> 50:22.480
Starting next month, two of my friends and I will be moving into a new house together.

50:23.600 --> 50:25.120
Each of us will have our own bedroom,

50:25.120 --> 50:28.800
but there's an extra medium-sized room downstairs no one will be using.

50:28.800 --> 50:33.040
The room has no egress window, so we don't want to make it into a bedroom.

50:33.040 --> 50:35.120
Got some code issues there, dig it.

50:35.120 --> 50:37.760
But we're at a loss for what we should do with it.

50:37.760 --> 50:42.160
I was hoping the brothers could come give us ideas about what we could do with this extra space.

50:42.160 --> 50:42.640
Any thoughts?

50:42.640 --> 50:44.720
That's from MiniProblem in Minneapolis.

50:45.280 --> 50:46.720
P.S. for what it's worth, we're all guys.

50:47.440 --> 50:47.940
Hot guys?

50:48.800 --> 50:49.520
All hot guys.

50:49.520 --> 50:51.440
Sincerely, Chad, Brad, and Blaze.

50:52.800 --> 50:54.080
Did you say Blizz?

50:54.080 --> 50:54.480
Three-

50:54.480 --> 50:55.040
And Blizz.

50:55.040 --> 50:56.000
Three hot bros.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.440
Blizz, Blaze, and Blonce.

50:58.640 --> 50:59.360
Just kidding, two of us.

50:59.360 --> 51:00.480
Blonce is the goofy one.

51:00.480 --> 51:01.360
Yeah, the goofy one.

51:01.360 --> 51:01.680
But it's still so hot.

51:01.680 --> 51:03.360
It's still super fucking hot.

51:03.360 --> 51:04.240
Incredibly gorgeous.

51:04.240 --> 51:05.200
Great work, Blonce.

51:06.960 --> 51:07.760
Blonce?

51:07.760 --> 51:08.960
He's Austrian.

51:08.960 --> 51:14.320
Guys, I didn't know egress windows were a thing.

51:14.880 --> 51:21.360
Because the first apartment we lived in, in the 13th story, which is great for starters,

51:21.360 --> 51:27.520
just in terms of fiery luck, we made Eric sleep in that one room that didn't have any windows in it.

51:28.720 --> 51:32.000
I think once you're on the 13th floor, Griffin, you don't have to worry about egress windows.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.800
Yeah, I don't think that's going to do you much good at that point.

51:34.800 --> 51:35.520
So how about this?

51:35.520 --> 51:42.560
Guys, lock the door to said room after filling it with like child's bedroom furniture that

51:42.560 --> 51:44.240
you've covered in dust and cobwebs.

51:48.560 --> 51:53.200
You're just leaving a little surprise for the next person that tries to remodel this place.

51:53.200 --> 51:54.720
Every time your friends come over and go,

51:54.720 --> 51:56.320
oh, I want a tour of your house.

51:56.320 --> 51:57.200
Yeah, this is the kitchen.

51:57.200 --> 51:57.840
Here's the living room.

51:57.840 --> 51:58.640
Our bedroom's upstairs.

51:58.640 --> 51:59.440
What's in that room?

51:59.440 --> 52:00.800
We don't go in there.

52:00.800 --> 52:02.080
We don't go in that room.

52:02.080 --> 52:04.000
Not since the boat accident.

52:04.000 --> 52:07.040
Travis, you just took that idea to 10.

52:07.040 --> 52:09.520
I'm about to take it just a little bit farther to 11.

52:09.520 --> 52:12.400
Can you wallpaper over the door to that room?

52:12.400 --> 52:16.640
Because then nobody's going to find it for 40 goddamn years,

52:16.640 --> 52:20.640
and it's going to have a level of authenticity at that point that I think is just going to-

52:20.640 --> 52:23.040
Ooh, and then in the center of the room, copy of Jumanji.

52:23.040 --> 52:24.880
Oh, wait a minute.

52:24.880 --> 52:25.680
The movie.

52:25.680 --> 52:26.400
Yeah, you lost me.

52:27.760 --> 52:28.800
That's great.

52:28.800 --> 52:29.760
That's real great.

52:29.760 --> 52:30.560
That's great.

52:30.560 --> 52:31.280
That's great.

52:31.280 --> 52:31.920
That's great.

52:31.920 --> 52:34.240
That's great. That's real great.

52:34.240 --> 52:34.560
That's too funny.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.840
That can be where you smoke all your pot.

52:38.800 --> 52:39.600
That's always important.

52:40.400 --> 52:40.880
Drug room?

52:41.680 --> 52:42.480
This is our drug room.

52:43.520 --> 52:44.960
The laziest panic room.

52:46.160 --> 52:47.040
Just go in there.

52:48.000 --> 52:48.800
Close the door.

52:48.800 --> 52:51.840
Dude, this is tricky because I've worked from home for a long time

52:52.880 --> 52:56.960
in a couple of places, including the house that I now own with my wife.

52:58.080 --> 53:00.240
One of the bedrooms is where I sleep,

53:00.240 --> 53:03.440
and the other one is where I work because it's my office,

53:03.440 --> 53:05.120
and it's like I get two rooms?

53:05.120 --> 53:06.400
That doesn't really seem fair.

53:07.120 --> 53:11.200
That doesn't really seem like an equitable situation.

53:11.840 --> 53:14.800
You could trade off and say like Monday, Wednesday, Friday,

53:14.800 --> 53:17.040
the room can be whatever guy A wants,

53:17.600 --> 53:22.000
but then Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, it's whatever guy B wants,

53:22.000 --> 53:26.080
and then Sunday, you share it free for all party room.

53:26.080 --> 53:29.760
If you guys had an extra room in the houses you live in now,

53:29.760 --> 53:30.880
what would you do with it?

53:30.880 --> 53:32.080
Yoga studio.

53:32.080 --> 53:33.760
Did you say yogurt studio?

53:33.760 --> 53:35.040
Because then maybe.

53:36.320 --> 53:38.160
Yeah, it's where I paint yogurt.

53:40.800 --> 53:44.880
I think, gosh, I don't know.

53:44.880 --> 53:47.600
We just did like a big purge of all our stuff.

53:47.600 --> 53:51.360
We had one extra room, and that was for the kids,

53:51.360 --> 53:54.480
so I guess I don't have any extra rooms anymore now.

53:54.480 --> 53:55.600
I don't know what I would do with it.

53:55.600 --> 53:59.920
Maybe like just more storage?

54:00.560 --> 54:04.400
Oh, man, you really shot the cannon indoors with that one.

54:05.040 --> 54:06.240
Here's what I would do.

54:07.040 --> 54:09.280
I'd put a bunch of newspaper clippings

54:09.280 --> 54:11.680
and pictures of people around town on the wall,

54:11.680 --> 54:13.840
and then with thumbtacks and pieces of string,

54:13.840 --> 54:16.240
connect all of them with certain people's faces.

54:16.240 --> 54:18.400
I have always wanted a room like this.

54:18.400 --> 54:20.640
Yeah, that's like what does it all mean?

54:20.640 --> 54:21.600
Where'd the money go?

54:22.480 --> 54:23.840
What happened with the case?

54:23.840 --> 54:25.680
You know, just all over it.

54:26.480 --> 54:29.200
That's just there for people to walk into and go,

54:29.200 --> 54:32.240
what is, and like, I've almost got it.

54:32.240 --> 54:33.200
I've almost got it.

54:33.200 --> 54:35.760
It's right there on the tip of my tongue.

54:35.760 --> 54:37.200
I've almost solved it.

54:37.200 --> 54:38.480
And then usher them out of the room.

54:39.040 --> 54:42.720
So basically, Travis, you want an all-purpose goof room.

54:43.520 --> 54:45.840
Yeah, I want like a room of requirement

54:45.840 --> 54:47.200
that every time you open the door,

54:47.200 --> 54:49.120
it's a different punchline to a joke.

54:49.120 --> 54:50.400
Sure, okay.

54:50.400 --> 54:52.320
And a team of people that changes it out

54:52.320 --> 54:54.720
betwixt the goofs. And they live there.

54:54.720 --> 54:56.560
Can we just please have a bedroom here?

54:57.120 --> 54:58.960
Please, you call us in here.

54:58.960 --> 54:59.680
No, you can't.

55:00.320 --> 55:01.840
This is our all-purpose goof room.

55:02.720 --> 55:04.400
We will sleep on the inflatable mattress

55:04.400 --> 55:05.280
in the dining room.

55:06.240 --> 55:09.360
Because that's, I mean, we gotta have our goofs.

55:11.440 --> 55:12.480
We're human.

55:12.480 --> 55:13.840
What are we supposed to do, not goof?

55:14.560 --> 55:15.280
We're human.

55:15.280 --> 55:16.800
Humans have to goof.

55:16.800 --> 55:18.160
Humans gotta goof.

55:18.160 --> 55:19.360
Always be goofing.

55:19.360 --> 55:19.920
That's us.

55:19.920 --> 55:20.400
That's us.

55:20.400 --> 55:21.600
And that's our show.

55:21.600 --> 55:23.120
So I want to wrap up.

55:23.120 --> 55:27.680
Let's get one more of these follow-ups.

55:27.680 --> 55:29.520
This was the one I was most excited about reading,

55:29.520 --> 55:30.560
so I saved it for the end.

55:31.200 --> 55:34.000
I wrote in asking advice on how to get our babysitter

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
just to skedaddle after my husband and I

55:36.000 --> 55:37.520
returned from a date night.

55:37.520 --> 55:39.600
You guys offered many practical solutions,

55:39.600 --> 55:41.680
and we naturally chose Justin's about faking

55:41.680 --> 55:45.120
explosive diarrhea immediately upon our return

55:45.120 --> 55:46.400
to apply to our next night out.

55:46.400 --> 55:47.440
So good.

55:47.440 --> 55:49.600
However, the fates intervened and it seemed

55:49.600 --> 55:51.680
it didn't smile on our planned dishonesty,

55:51.680 --> 55:53.520
as we didn't need the faking illness,

55:53.520 --> 55:56.400
and I got horribly carsick on the drive home from our date.

55:56.400 --> 55:58.240
It did end up rushing through the door

55:58.240 --> 56:00.640
and making it rain dollars on the babysitter

56:00.640 --> 56:01.920
on my way to the bathroom.

56:01.920 --> 56:04.720
So in that way, our plan was a success.

56:04.720 --> 56:06.400
Thanks so much for all you guys do.

56:06.400 --> 56:07.360
Really enjoy your show.

56:07.360 --> 56:08.160
Happy 200.

56:08.160 --> 56:10.480
Is karma punishing our listeners?

56:10.480 --> 56:11.520
It's not karma.

56:11.520 --> 56:12.880
It's not karma.

56:12.880 --> 56:14.560
It's fucking clairvoyance.

56:14.560 --> 56:19.040
We are the diarrhea mediums.

56:19.040 --> 56:20.400
Starring Patricia Arquette.

56:22.800 --> 56:24.720
I knew we'd be good for something someday.

56:25.680 --> 56:27.520
Predicting people's diarrhea.

56:27.520 --> 56:28.640
Don't get on our-

56:28.640 --> 56:31.440
At some point in the future, you will have diarrhea.

56:31.440 --> 56:34.880
Don't get on our bad side ever, listeners.

56:34.880 --> 56:37.120
Don't you hit that unsubscribe button.

56:37.120 --> 56:40.480
Jeff, who will have diarrhea on June 7th

56:40.480 --> 56:46.640
at three o'clock after eating that weird hot pocket

56:46.640 --> 56:49.280
in the back of his freezer he shouldn't have ate?

56:50.640 --> 56:53.520
They don't even make the meatball one anymore, Jeff,

56:53.520 --> 56:54.880
for this explicit reason.

56:55.760 --> 56:57.200
Enjoy your diarrhea, though.

56:57.200 --> 56:59.040
Maybe think about subscribing again in the future

56:59.040 --> 56:59.920
and becoming a donor.

57:01.280 --> 57:03.040
Only then will we repeal our curse.

57:06.800 --> 57:08.960
Well, that's gonna do it for us here

57:08.960 --> 57:11.600
on my brother and brother me episode two hundo.

57:12.320 --> 57:13.760
Gosh, I can't believe we made it,

57:13.760 --> 57:17.840
and we're so thankful, so, so, so thankful

57:17.840 --> 57:21.680
to all of you for sticking with us through thick and thin.

57:23.200 --> 57:24.000
We really do love you.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.600
I know, we don't say it enough.

57:25.600 --> 57:26.400
We don't.

57:26.400 --> 57:27.280
Thank you so much.

57:27.280 --> 57:31.520
This show is a crazy, crazy,

57:31.520 --> 57:33.280
I can't even call it a dream come true

57:33.280 --> 57:37.360
because like what psychopath would dream of something

57:37.360 --> 57:40.560
like what we do, it's crazy,

57:40.560 --> 57:42.160
and it's the best thing ever,

57:42.160 --> 57:44.320
and we're very, very, very thankful for it.

Thank you to people tweeting about the show

57:47.200 --> 57:51.040

58:05.120 --> 58:08.160
And thanks again to Naturebox.

58:18.960 --> 58:20.480
That's gonna do it for us, right?

58:20.480 --> 58:21.760
No, no, we're not even close.

58:21.760 --> 58:24.240
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

58:24.240 --> 58:25.120
for the use of our theme song,

58:25.120 --> 58:27.280
It's a Departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

58:28.400 --> 58:31.440
You can get that wherever good music is sold.

58:31.440 --> 58:33.760
Don't go looking for it in the bad music store.

58:33.760 --> 58:34.880
You will not find it.

58:34.880 --> 58:36.960
I wanna remind you about BoatParty.biz,

58:37.840 --> 58:40.560
the Atlantic Ocean Music and Comedy Festival.

58:41.600 --> 58:43.360
They are still selling tickets to that,

58:43.360 --> 58:44.400
and it's gonna be amazing.

58:44.400 --> 58:46.320
You can go on a cruise to Jamaica,

58:46.320 --> 58:48.400
and they announced three new acts.

58:48.400 --> 58:52.960
The Antebalas, Afrobeat Orchestra, Lake, and Matt Braunger

58:53.600 --> 58:54.800
are all gonna be there.

58:55.920 --> 58:58.240
And a ton of like funny people

58:58.240 --> 59:02.080
and W. Kamau Bell and John Roderick and-

59:02.080 --> 59:03.200
Of the Long Winters.

59:03.200 --> 59:04.080
Of the Long Winters.

59:04.080 --> 59:05.120
Of fame.

59:05.120 --> 59:07.760
BoatParty.biz, go.

59:07.760 --> 59:10.960
Next week, we're probably gonna have to do a weird app.

59:10.960 --> 59:12.400
I'm not sure what it's gonna look like,

59:12.400 --> 59:14.000
but I'm going out of town for a while.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.440
We need to start saving up shit

59:15.440 --> 59:18.320
for the crazy three podcast day

59:18.320 --> 59:20.000
that we have coming up in a couple of weeks.

59:21.760 --> 59:24.240
So next week is probably gonna be,

59:24.240 --> 59:25.280
what is it gonna be, Juice?

59:25.280 --> 59:26.160
You wanna know my best of?

59:26.160 --> 59:26.800
Best of?

59:26.800 --> 59:27.840
Yeah, you and I can work on a best of.

59:27.840 --> 59:29.600
But still, go ahead and send in questions.

59:29.600 --> 59:30.960
Please, please, please, please.

59:30.960 --> 59:32.160
We gotta do three shows.

59:32.160 --> 59:34.480
We are bone dry in the Yahoo department.

59:36.480 --> 59:39.040
I need Emerald member Drew Davenport.

59:39.040 --> 59:40.160
I need Ira Ray.

59:40.160 --> 59:41.760
Are you out there, Ira Ray?

59:41.760 --> 59:42.880
How about Jacob Locker?

59:42.880 --> 59:43.600
Where you been, buddy?

59:43.600 --> 59:44.320
Krista Whalen.

59:44.320 --> 59:45.120
Krista Whalen.

59:45.120 --> 59:46.640
Guys, I need some help.

59:46.640 --> 59:48.240
I need some serious help.

59:49.040 --> 59:51.280
Also, we are in the final stages

59:52.080 --> 59:54.640
of planning for a live show in June.

59:56.800 --> 59:58.000
With our app next week,

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.080
we may or may not be able to announce it

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:00.720
when it's all done.

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:02.400
So make sure you're following,

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:04.160
check us out on Twitter

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.920
and check mybrotherandmybrotherandme.com

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:08.880
or maxfun.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.240
And we will announce that as soon as it's up

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.680
and make sure everybody gets a chance

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:14.160
to get tickets.

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:16.720
It's gonna be in Los Angeles if all goes well.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.200
So make sure you stay tuned

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.200
and pay attention to our Twitter feed.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:24.080
And we're trying to figure out a way to do more.

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:25.760
That's all I'll say for now.

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:27.440
That's all I'll say for now.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:30.560
But we're doing a lot already this year for us.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.600
For us, it's a lot.

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:33.440
For a throwing shade, it's not very much.

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:34.560
They're very good at this.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.120
We're very bad.

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:36.640
We're very bad.

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.600
Anyway, that's it for us.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.800
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:39.280
Thank you.

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.160
You're all the best.

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:40.720
We love you.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.360
Please share the show with a friend.

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:44.480
Maybe not at this episode.

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:45.520
It seemed kind of hit or miss,

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:46.800
but like another one, a good one.

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:48.000
Have them-

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.320
One that's already proven to be a classic.

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:50.800
Right.

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:51.200
Who knows?

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:53.920
Maybe this will ascend to the annals of comedy history.

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:54.640
It's hard to say.

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:56.960
But that's gonna-

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.320
Thanks. I mean, thank you.

01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:58.960
Thank you.

01:00:58.960 --> 01:00:59.440
That's it.

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.720
Griff, do you have a last yahoo?

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:01.120
Yeah, let's-

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:02.560
Oh, and before we go, hold on.

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:03.280
Whoops.

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:03.920
I got one more.

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:05.760
Thanks to Max Fun.

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:06.480
Yeah.

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:10.320
On like episode like 32, we joined Max Fun,

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.160
and it's just been super great since then.

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.080
We wouldn't have been able to do, you know,

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:16.880
the last 170-some episodes without them.

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:20.000
If you don't listen to all the other Max Fun podcasts,

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.480
go to maximumfun.org and fix that right now,

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:23.440
because they're all amazing.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.840
And it's a super great place to be a part of.

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.520
So thank you to them.

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:27.920
Thank you.

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:28.800
Thank you.

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:29.840
Go listen to all the shows.

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:31.120
Yes, definitely do that.

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.240
This final yahoo was sent in by Michael R.

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:34.960
Thank you, Michael.

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:37.600
It's by yahoo answers user Glenn.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:38.480
Pretty hot boy name.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:40.480
Glenn asks,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.080
how to get Cosmo Kramer hair.

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:48.240
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:48.960
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:50.000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:50.880
It's been my brother, my brother.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.000
May kiss your dad.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:01.600
Skull and lips.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.480
Maximumfun.org.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:13.520
Comedy and culture.

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.640
Artist owned.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:15.600
Listener supported.

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:20.480
Hey folks, this is Kevin Allison of the Max Fun podcast,

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:23.040
Risk, where people tell true stories

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.200
they never thought they'd dare to share.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.720
If you've never heard Risk,

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:29.600
why not start with our 150th episode?

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:32.960
It's an all star lineup of jaw dropping true stories

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.320
from Aisha Tyler.

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.680
This being the nineties,

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:36.800
I was drinking malt liquor.

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.240
Don't fuck you with your racist thoughts.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:40.400
You're all racist for laughing.

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:42.400
Tom Lennon.

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:45.040
Whenever I walk into a place that's called Mr. Binkies,

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.680
I'm expecting Armenian bumblebee to be like,

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:49.440
I got jack off pills for you.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.640
Yeah.

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:51.600
Jay Moore.

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.360
Me, public school in New Jersey.

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:54.560
I didn't need to know anything

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:55.840
because everybody knew you got pregnant

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.040
by peeing in each other's butts.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.320
That's how we knew.

01:02:58.320 --> 01:02:59.360
Andy Dick.

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:03.040
We've had a monogamous relationship for five years.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.880
I barely cheated on her.

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:08.640
And The Daily Show's Jessica Williams.

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:09.520
Oh my God.

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:12.400
I have like this need to be responsible for some reason

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.080
that doesn't really benefit me.

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:16.880
So like, Jessica, clean it up.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.560
Look for Risk on iTunes

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:21.680
or of course at MaximumFun.org.
