00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.760
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern era.

00:47.760 --> 00:51.040
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

00:51.040 --> 00:56.800
I'm your babiest baby baby, Griffin McElroy. April showers have brought May flowers.

00:56.800 --> 01:03.920
We are recording before May, sir. There's no way that you know about the relative florality.

01:05.200 --> 01:09.920
My flowers have already come in. I got some Easter lilies that done popped off.

01:09.920 --> 01:12.720
But then they're not May flowers, you fucking liar.

01:12.720 --> 01:17.840
Yeah, April showers done brought April flowers again, Twight.

01:17.840 --> 01:18.720
I guess.

01:18.720 --> 01:21.840
You don't know. There could be a solar flare tomorrow.

01:21.840 --> 01:26.800
It kills everything on Earth, like in that movie Next.

01:26.800 --> 01:32.080
Please don't say things like that, Griffin. You know how prone I am to panic like that.

01:32.080 --> 01:38.560
Please don't put also in my sphere of consciousness the possibility of solar flare activity.

01:38.560 --> 01:44.320
April showers bring April flowers and May brings a total global extinction event.

01:45.680 --> 01:46.800
Like in the movie Next.

01:47.840 --> 01:51.280
Or an extinction level event like on the Busta Rhymes album.

01:51.280 --> 01:52.160
Which one?

01:52.160 --> 01:52.660
Yes.

01:53.360 --> 01:55.760
Extinction level event is the name of that one.

01:55.760 --> 01:57.040
I'm not familiar.

01:57.680 --> 01:59.360
Man, I hope I got that right.

02:00.800 --> 02:07.840
I do not make many rap references and I did not. Yes, correct.

02:08.480 --> 02:09.600
I did nail that one.

02:10.240 --> 02:13.840
A no look shot from Justin McElroy, nothing but net.

02:13.840 --> 02:14.800
A no Wikipedia shot.

02:14.800 --> 02:18.720
A no listen, no knowledge of what the fuck he's talking about shot.

02:18.720 --> 02:22.400
I sunk it. I sunk it and I'm gonna live with that forever.

02:23.120 --> 02:28.000
Never forget that one time I made that Busta reference and everybody loved it.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.040
Is there really nothing we can talk about in the news that's like-

02:33.040 --> 02:36.000
I mean, there's Hoskins.

02:36.560 --> 02:41.760
Yeah, that'll be a real goof starter. A real barn burner and a goof starter, that one.

02:41.760 --> 02:45.040
At least my wife will finally be able to tell him and Danny DeVito apart,

02:45.040 --> 02:47.920
so that's like something. If you see one of those guys, it's Danny.

02:47.920 --> 02:56.240
Yeah, but unless you're watching an old movie in which I didn't typically see Hoskins on my day

02:56.240 --> 03:01.280
to day, I would witness him in the long go Friday or something like that,

03:01.840 --> 03:04.160
not like on the street and be like, are you DeVito?

03:06.400 --> 03:07.520
I bet he got that a lot though.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.960
Probably not, they look nothing alike.

03:10.240 --> 03:10.720
And he's British.

03:10.720 --> 03:11.440
And also he's British.

03:12.240 --> 03:15.120
I'm ready to help people and I know you guys are too, so let's just get to it.

03:15.120 --> 03:19.600
Yeah, now that I'm super sad about Bob Hoskins, let's go ahead and light the ignition.

03:19.600 --> 03:24.560
I'm a recently single 27 year old female. I've always had a thing for older guys,

03:24.560 --> 03:28.720
but I'm wondering how old is too old and that's from- it's not because of daddy issues.

03:30.240 --> 03:33.440
That's good context, I appreciate that in there.

03:35.280 --> 03:37.120
My first question is, maybe it is.

03:40.240 --> 03:40.800
That's my first question.

03:40.800 --> 03:45.920
Kind of a weird shade to throw at this person we've just met, but okay.

03:47.920 --> 03:53.360
Listen, I totally get it because older dudes tend to have their shit together.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.440
Older humans tend to have their shit together.

03:57.440 --> 04:00.640
Regardless of gender, the older you are, the more shit together you typically have.

04:00.640 --> 04:03.760
Yes, but the question asker didn't say, I like to date older humans.

04:04.720 --> 04:05.920
That's a good point.

04:05.920 --> 04:10.560
But I don't know that that's 100% true because I feel like there's a bell curve where you start

04:10.560 --> 04:15.520
to figure shit out in your 30s and then when you turn 45, you fucking lose the script a little bit.

04:16.240 --> 04:22.160
I'm pretty sure that what the key to this is just to pick somebody who's sort of your

04:22.160 --> 04:28.160
constant in the- like an older male actor that is your constant-

04:28.160 --> 04:32.480
Or scientist or political figure. You don't have to limit it to just celebrity.

04:32.480 --> 04:39.600
That's fine. Pick the sexiest biologist you can find and let him be your bellwether.

04:39.600 --> 04:42.480
By which I mean, let's say you settle on Clooney.

04:42.480 --> 04:44.880
That feels right to me as a 27 year old.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.400
You settle on Clooney.

04:46.400 --> 04:55.280
As Clooney ages, so does your window of fellas you can date.

04:55.280 --> 05:00.160
So it's a constantly shifting window between your age and Clooney's age.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.440
Here's a counter question.

05:01.440 --> 05:09.440
As you age, how suddenly will there be an age at which they are older but too young to fit

05:09.440 --> 05:10.800
within your window?

05:11.840 --> 05:17.280
You know, so like right now at 27, maybe 40, you know, it's like I'm attracted to older guys and

05:17.280 --> 05:18.800
that age starts at 40.

05:18.800 --> 05:24.240
But when you're like 34, 40 won't fit into that window anymore.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.120
No, now it's 60.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.560
I get some graph paper or something.

05:26.560 --> 05:27.060
Yeah.

05:27.060 --> 05:33.300
There's got to be a sliding scale where it's like 10 years older, but not older than, you know,

05:33.300 --> 05:35.380
25 years older than you.

05:35.380 --> 05:38.900
Something like that, you know, anywhere it always moves with you as you go.

05:38.900 --> 05:40.900
So that when you're like 67.

05:40.900 --> 05:44.580
How is that fundamentally different from my Clooney?

05:44.580 --> 05:47.060
Because you didn't have a starting age.

05:47.060 --> 05:48.100
Or a cutoff, Justin.

05:48.100 --> 05:58.260
Your theory is based on the idea that, for instance, myself and George Clooney are aging

05:58.260 --> 06:00.100
at different rates.

06:00.100 --> 06:07.460
I'm pretty sure that every second that passes in George Clooney life also expends a second

06:07.460 --> 06:09.300
of my time on this earth.

06:09.300 --> 06:10.020
Does that make sense?

06:10.020 --> 06:14.180
That's actually a common misconception, Griffin, because he is on famous time.

06:14.180 --> 06:18.020
He's paid for, have you seen that movie Out of Time with Justin Timberlake?

06:18.020 --> 06:18.820
I have not.

06:18.820 --> 06:23.460
But what I believe happens in it is that when people are rich and famous, they can't afford

06:23.460 --> 06:25.780
to be a little bit more leisurely about their day to day.

06:26.980 --> 06:29.940
Let's all put our cards on the table, okay?

06:29.940 --> 06:36.660
One day of Clooney's life is probably worth one year of our life, right?

06:36.660 --> 06:42.820
Like when Clooney passed, here's my, here's my, here's my, here's my, here's my, here's

06:42.820 --> 06:44.900
my, here's what I'm saying.

06:45.620 --> 06:47.380
On the sad day that George Clooney passed...

06:47.380 --> 06:47.860
Oh great.

06:47.860 --> 06:49.300
Now let's keep all of this, like...

06:50.420 --> 06:51.540
Now, hang on.

06:51.540 --> 06:52.260
Now, hear me out.

06:53.300 --> 06:57.220
On the day that George Clooney passes, if we assume that I'm still alive, I hope I'm

06:57.220 --> 06:57.620
not.

06:57.620 --> 06:58.820
I don't want to see this.

06:58.820 --> 07:04.660
But when George Clooney passes, I would assume that the majority of the human population

07:04.660 --> 07:11.940
would say, I would trade one more day of George Clooney on this earth for one year of this

07:11.940 --> 07:14.440
portly gentleman from West Virginia's life.

07:14.440 --> 07:15.280
I would trade away one year.

07:15.280 --> 07:16.280
I have enough people do that.

07:16.280 --> 07:18.040
We could have Clooney for another month

07:18.040 --> 07:20.240
and Justin would be dead.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.560
Think about it.

07:21.560 --> 07:23.940
I just think Clooney would appreciate it.

07:23.940 --> 07:25.960
And I think that given the possibility,

07:25.960 --> 07:27.840
most people would prefer to have Clooney.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.160
That's all I'm saying.

07:29.160 --> 07:30.320
How many people do you think,

07:30.320 --> 07:32.480
how many days do you think we could gain back

07:32.480 --> 07:35.920
from people doing like a give a year, get a day program?

07:35.920 --> 07:40.160
Is Clooney the best target for this?

07:40.160 --> 07:43.160
Are we saying that he is the most valuable human being

07:43.160 --> 07:44.000
on earth?

07:44.000 --> 07:44.820
You are correct, Griffin,

07:44.820 --> 07:46.680
because we need to do Clooney and Brad Pitt

07:46.680 --> 07:49.320
so we can have like oceans 46.

07:49.320 --> 07:52.900
That's going to eat up a thousand human lives.

07:52.900 --> 07:56.640
We are going to throw a thousand human lives into a Clooney.

07:56.640 --> 07:57.720
How many people are you willing to lay down

07:57.720 --> 07:58.920
before the altar of Clooney?

07:58.920 --> 08:01.960
Who are we going to toss into the soul furnace?

08:03.260 --> 08:06.080
It will really hustle up production though.

08:06.080 --> 08:08.580
Like if Stevie Soda is like,

08:08.580 --> 08:10.480
can we get one more take on that?

08:10.480 --> 08:11.920
And it's like, well, I don't know.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.200
I don't know.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.360
I don't know, Stevie.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.240
Do you know somebody who's going to trade away

08:16.240 --> 08:18.320
a year of their life for this extra shot?

08:18.320 --> 08:19.160
Cause it's not, I say we got it.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.320
Oh, it's like Kickstarter, but with like,

08:21.320 --> 08:22.400
with your life force.

08:22.400 --> 08:25.500
It's Patreon, but with a soul furnace

08:25.500 --> 08:28.560
that you have to burn your whole family into.

08:28.560 --> 08:30.920
To be fair, Patreon already does kind of sound

08:30.920 --> 08:31.880
like a soul furnace.

08:31.880 --> 08:33.120
That's true.

08:33.120 --> 08:35.320
It's a very great- Let your children be gnashed

08:35.320 --> 08:38.560
in the teeth of Patreon, the soul furnace.

08:38.560 --> 08:43.560
Step your ears into his gape.

08:43.920 --> 08:45.360
Gross.

08:45.360 --> 08:46.440
Gross.

08:46.440 --> 08:47.280
So-

08:47.280 --> 08:49.160
Gaping ma of Patreon, the soul furnace.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.360
To answer your question,

08:51.360 --> 08:53.640
burn yourself in the soul furnace.

08:53.640 --> 08:55.560
And maybe we can, maybe we can get a new

08:55.560 --> 08:56.480
ocean movie going.

08:57.960 --> 08:58.780
Graffiti got a Yahoo?

08:58.780 --> 08:59.620
Yeah, sure.

09:01.060 --> 09:03.180
This Yahoo was sent in by Alan Black.

09:03.180 --> 09:04.020
Thank you, Alan Black.

09:04.020 --> 09:08.720
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Beth, who asks,

09:08.720 --> 09:12.780
can I become a police officer, but I'm tiny.

09:14.160 --> 09:15.000
So that's nice.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.240
You heard that first part and you were like,

09:16.240 --> 09:17.940
well, yes, obviously.

09:17.940 --> 09:18.780
And then she was like,

09:18.780 --> 09:21.560
she's arguing with you in the title of the question.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.720
Although I have the option of striving

09:23.720 --> 09:24.880
for something more academic,

09:24.880 --> 09:26.960
it's always been my passion to help people.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.240
I want to be on the front lines.

09:28.240 --> 09:30.120
My problem is that I'm very small.

09:30.120 --> 09:32.640
At only five foot four and a hundred pounds,

09:32.640 --> 09:34.920
won't it be difficult for me to do my job?

09:34.920 --> 09:37.540
I work with horses and sometimes face difficulties

09:37.540 --> 09:40.860
due to my size, but do have techniques and tools

09:40.860 --> 09:44.460
to aid me in most situations to achieve the same outcome

09:44.460 --> 09:47.480
that a larger, taller, stronger person would get.

09:47.480 --> 09:50.440
Would working as an officer require similar techniques

09:50.440 --> 09:53.320
or tools, or would I really be struggling

09:53.320 --> 09:54.520
with this shortcoming?

09:54.520 --> 09:56.420
No pun intended, I'm assuming.

09:56.420 --> 09:58.560
If it helps, I live in Western Canada.

09:59.880 --> 10:01.920
And then of course there's like nine comments

10:01.920 --> 10:02.960
of Yahoo Answers users.

10:02.960 --> 10:06.200
People like, yeah, just shoot them with your gun.

10:07.560 --> 10:08.400
And then she updates.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.800
I don't have guns in Canada.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.160
She updates to say,

10:11.160 --> 10:13.640
I don't believe drawing your gun to intimidate people

10:13.640 --> 10:16.920
is something law enforcement encourages on a daily basis.

10:16.920 --> 10:20.520
Well, but I feel like she's answered her own question.

10:21.380 --> 10:22.600
She likes to ride horses.

10:22.600 --> 10:23.680
She's going to be a Mountie.

10:23.680 --> 10:26.800
You're on the, like a huge intimidating animal.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.800
Yeah, you're absolutely right Travis.

10:28.800 --> 10:29.720
When you're on a horse,

10:29.720 --> 10:34.720
that horse's height gets naturally added to your height.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.740
A person on a, what I'm saying to you

10:36.740 --> 10:39.400
is the person on a horse is the tallest thing in the world

10:39.400 --> 10:43.900
because they are elevated not just by hooves and stems,

10:43.900 --> 10:47.880
but they're elevated by spirit and a bond

10:47.880 --> 10:49.280
that most of us could never understand.

10:49.280 --> 10:51.360
That's six inches right there.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.480
Six inches of bond.

10:52.480 --> 10:53.920
Right there. Easy.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.180
Can you imagine Yao Ming on a horse?

10:57.300 --> 10:59.520
Yeah, that's how Galactus got his start.

10:59.520 --> 11:00.440
Did you know that?

11:00.440 --> 11:01.380
Where's Earth?

11:02.800 --> 11:04.360
It's in Yao Ming's mouth.

11:04.360 --> 11:06.000
But he was on the Earth, I know.

11:07.720 --> 11:08.560
Now where is he?

11:08.560 --> 11:09.380
Now where is he?

11:09.380 --> 11:10.220
We don't know.

11:10.220 --> 11:11.060
He's all around you.

11:12.640 --> 11:13.540
Keep looking up.

11:13.540 --> 11:18.120
I have never had an encounter with a police officer

11:18.120 --> 11:21.720
that I would consider great.

11:24.320 --> 11:27.760
And in no circumstance did I feel

11:27.760 --> 11:32.120
like I had a better shot at coming out of the encounter

11:32.120 --> 11:37.120
with more of my dignity in hand

11:37.560 --> 11:39.720
based on the size of the person

11:39.720 --> 11:42.880
who was fucking writing me a ticket

11:42.880 --> 11:45.280
for just living my goddamn life.

11:46.620 --> 11:49.240
Like if a person, in the many, many times

11:49.240 --> 11:50.920
that I have been penalized

11:50.920 --> 11:53.720
just for living my goddamn day to day,

11:53.720 --> 11:58.640
I've never looked at the officer who was penalizing me

11:58.640 --> 12:01.120
and gone, well, I'm a couple inches taller than you,

12:01.120 --> 12:01.940
so.

12:03.600 --> 12:06.560
Yeah, I would say I very rarely size up

12:06.560 --> 12:08.560
a police officer I'm interacting with.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.600
I don't think, could I take this person?

12:10.600 --> 12:12.840
I tend to just sort of hand over my wallet

12:12.840 --> 12:13.680
and ask for leave.

12:13.680 --> 12:16.000
Hey, just take as much as you want out of there, man.

12:16.000 --> 12:16.960
You got me.

12:16.960 --> 12:17.920
You got me.

12:17.920 --> 12:22.500
Oh, I was drinking a Diet Mountain Dew at a bus stop.

12:22.500 --> 12:23.520
Didn't know that was.

12:23.520 --> 12:24.360
Yeah, go ahead.

12:24.360 --> 12:26.200
Just, what do you think, like 150?

12:26.200 --> 12:28.000
200 for sure.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Oh, 200, sure.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.040
I mean, I don't have 200 in the wallet.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.400
I can hit the ATM if you,

12:32.400 --> 12:34.960
oh, you're just gonna come with me to the ATM.

12:34.960 --> 12:35.800
Okay.

12:35.800 --> 12:36.880
Oh, I'm being robbed at the ATM.

12:36.880 --> 12:37.700
Can you stop?

12:37.700 --> 12:38.960
Oh, you didn't stop him.

12:38.960 --> 12:40.320
Still want that 200 though.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.540
That's okay.

12:43.760 --> 12:48.440
Somebody has got to be around to catch the short criminals.

12:48.440 --> 12:52.120
If you're too tall, maybe you're at a disadvantage there.

12:52.120 --> 12:57.080
Maybe that's when you get the smaller officer on the scene.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.840
I would almost argue that the problem is

12:59.840 --> 13:01.800
that this person is not small enough

13:01.800 --> 13:04.340
because I think you got a crust backwards

13:04.340 --> 13:06.120
to be the tiny detective.

13:06.120 --> 13:07.360
And if you're the tiny detective,

13:07.360 --> 13:12.360
like we got someone under five-fives been murdered,

13:12.960 --> 13:15.240
call the tiny detective.

13:15.240 --> 13:16.760
We've tracked the serial killer,

13:16.760 --> 13:19.560
but he's hiding under a porch.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.000
Get the tiny detective.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.120
Get the tiny detective.

13:23.120 --> 13:23.960
You will be-

13:23.960 --> 13:26.280
I can't been far enough to see these footprints.

13:26.280 --> 13:27.120
Yeah.

13:27.120 --> 13:27.960
Damn, my height.

13:27.960 --> 13:29.880
Someone with lower eyes.

13:32.160 --> 13:34.120
I think you're gonna be in real danger

13:34.120 --> 13:37.160
of encroaching on the rescue rangers here though.

13:37.160 --> 13:39.080
Yeah, that seems like their beat.

13:39.080 --> 13:41.460
I would argue that a crime has officially gone

13:41.460 --> 13:42.560
slipping through the cracks

13:42.560 --> 13:44.460
if it's somewhere that the tiny detective

13:44.460 --> 13:46.360
is needed to access.

13:46.360 --> 13:47.200
Yeah.

13:47.200 --> 13:50.020
That's something, where's that TLC show, you know?

13:50.020 --> 13:51.880
They make a show about the littlest chocolatiers,

13:51.880 --> 13:56.800
which is, I'm sorry, fucking stereotyping and racism,

13:56.800 --> 13:59.400
but they won't make a show about a little person

13:59.400 --> 14:02.440
that's defying societal conventions

14:02.440 --> 14:04.400
and busting some fucking perps.

14:04.400 --> 14:07.060
Sure, it's also, where's the proof, you know?

14:07.060 --> 14:08.960
That's what I've always wondered.

14:08.960 --> 14:10.080
What do you mean?

14:10.080 --> 14:12.000
I'm saying this show is saying,

14:12.000 --> 14:13.020
hey, check this out.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.020
We got the littlest chocolatiers here.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.000
Fucking prove it.

14:16.920 --> 14:17.760
Yeah.

14:17.760 --> 14:18.580
That's a fine point.

14:18.580 --> 14:19.420
Fucking prove to me

14:19.420 --> 14:22.160
that there aren't littler chocolatiers somewhere.

14:22.160 --> 14:23.480
I don't think you can.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.520
There's a lot of people on this earth.

14:25.520 --> 14:27.400
The littlest chocolatiers is about them

14:27.400 --> 14:30.040
going around the globe and whacking smaller chocolatiers.

14:30.040 --> 14:31.400
Yeah.

14:31.400 --> 14:32.560
One day, their strive,

14:32.560 --> 14:35.200
the littlest chocolatiers is not a title

14:35.200 --> 14:36.960
as much as a goal.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.600
Yeah, when it started out,

14:38.600 --> 14:40.900
it was we're the 19th littlest chocolatiers,

14:40.900 --> 14:42.120
and now they're down to like the fourth.

14:42.120 --> 14:44.120
The other three are in hiding.

14:44.120 --> 14:45.000
Not good.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.540
This also would be a very upsetting premise

14:47.540 --> 14:48.920
for 19 kids and counting.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.720
Sure, sure would.

14:50.720 --> 14:51.720
Boy.

14:51.720 --> 14:54.200
Counting, but in which direction?

14:54.200 --> 14:55.040
Oh, no.

14:55.040 --> 14:56.840
You're right.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.800
This week on the series finale

14:58.800 --> 15:00.440
of One Kid and Counting,

15:02.000 --> 15:03.720
a race through the woods,

15:03.720 --> 15:05.140
a desperate hunt.

15:06.040 --> 15:08.160
Only one will emerge victorious.

15:08.160 --> 15:09.020
And by this point,

15:09.020 --> 15:11.720
the kid is basically Katniss from The Hunger Games.

15:11.720 --> 15:14.080
The kid is hiding in tree tops,

15:14.080 --> 15:17.360
taking out deer with a bow for sustenance.

15:17.360 --> 15:18.360
Ah, fuck, we ran out of kids.

15:18.360 --> 15:19.200
K plus eight.

15:19.200 --> 15:22.280
Can we get like three of them?

15:22.280 --> 15:24.240
Please, Sweeps is coming up.

15:24.240 --> 15:26.540
My wife is expecting our firstborn in July,

15:26.540 --> 15:29.060
and I'm trying to keep my cursing to a minimum.

15:29.060 --> 15:33.240
I recently used cowabunga in place of an expletive,

15:33.240 --> 15:35.180
and let's just say I suffered some serious mockery

15:35.180 --> 15:37.120
from my wife for using that word,

15:37.120 --> 15:38.040
and you earned it.

15:38.040 --> 15:40.500
Can we please suggest some place words

15:40.500 --> 15:43.000
I could use instead of typical expletives?

15:43.000 --> 15:45.080
That's from Cussin in Canada.

15:45.080 --> 15:46.360
How about these?

15:46.360 --> 15:49.000
Fuck, shit, ass, dick.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.640
Like, if your kid hears you say this shit

15:51.640 --> 15:52.520
and goes to school,

15:52.520 --> 15:54.560
and it's like, stubs his toe in second grade,

15:54.560 --> 15:56.040
and is like, oh, cowabunga,

15:56.040 --> 15:57.780
he is gonna be killed.

15:57.780 --> 16:02.780
He's gonna learn a lot of curse words very fast.

16:02.800 --> 16:05.360
Let me bounce this off you two.

16:05.360 --> 16:08.240
In second grade, I swore like a fucking sailor,

16:08.240 --> 16:09.960
and so did everybody I know,

16:09.960 --> 16:14.160
and maybe that explains like why I am the way I am today,

16:14.160 --> 16:16.560
but like it was a nonstop,

16:16.560 --> 16:21.560
just like jet stream of filth coming out of my mouth.

16:22.400 --> 16:25.080
Listen, here's some advice.

16:25.080 --> 16:27.640
We teach kids about words and language all the time,

16:27.640 --> 16:29.800
where we say like, oh no, that's not a dog, it's a cat,

16:29.800 --> 16:31.160
and this is what a cat is,

16:31.160 --> 16:33.280
and kids have this,

16:33.280 --> 16:35.200
there's this psychologist named Piaget

16:35.200 --> 16:37.680
who had this box theory that as kids develop,

16:37.680 --> 16:40.760
they form boxes into which ideas are put,

16:40.760 --> 16:43.160
and so when you like show a kid a dog and say,

16:43.160 --> 16:46.380
that's a dog, it was okay, four legs, fur, dog, right?

16:46.380 --> 16:47.720
And then you have to break down that like,

16:47.720 --> 16:49.440
no, sometimes it's a cat, so whatever.

16:49.440 --> 16:52.440
You stupid fucking kid, that's obviously a dog.

16:52.440 --> 16:54.960
So why don't we teach our kids the same thing with language

16:54.960 --> 16:57.100
like, hey, fuck is an awesome word,

16:57.100 --> 16:59.400
but it's used to apply in this situation

16:59.400 --> 17:01.120
and not this situation.

17:01.120 --> 17:04.960
Use it here, don't use it here, don't be an asshole.

17:04.960 --> 17:07.640
I think you just tell them like if you use it at a teacher,

17:07.640 --> 17:09.080
you get in trouble,

17:09.080 --> 17:10.120
but when you're on the playground,

17:10.120 --> 17:11.560
if you say cowabunga,

17:11.560 --> 17:14.280
you're gonna get jumped out of the playground.

17:14.280 --> 17:17.480
So yeah, so teach your kids like what words to say when

17:17.480 --> 17:18.760
and when not to say them,

17:18.760 --> 17:21.300
and let your kid just be like a goddamn human being

17:21.300 --> 17:22.560
living in the world,

17:22.560 --> 17:23.800
and don't try to shelter your kid

17:23.800 --> 17:26.160
because otherwise they're gonna learn the words

17:26.160 --> 17:28.040
because look, they're going to,

17:28.040 --> 17:29.240
it's in TV, it's in movies,

17:29.240 --> 17:30.560
every other kid on the playground.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.240
They're gonna watch Game of Thrones.

17:32.240 --> 17:34.720
They're gonna know what fisting is before they're six.

17:34.720 --> 17:35.560
Yeah.

17:35.560 --> 17:38.040
So if you don't teach your kid some kind of context

17:38.040 --> 17:39.760
to put these words into,

17:39.760 --> 17:41.640
then you're just handing them a loaded gun

17:41.640 --> 17:42.480
and letting them go.

17:42.480 --> 17:43.300
You know what I mean?

17:43.300 --> 17:45.720
Teach the words to the kids.

17:45.720 --> 17:46.840
Tell them what they mean,

17:46.840 --> 17:48.840
and when to use them and when not to use them,

17:48.840 --> 17:51.480
and treat kids like tiny adults.

17:51.480 --> 17:52.600
That's what I do.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.240
I've been thinking about this a lot lately

17:54.240 --> 17:55.080
with a kid on the way,

17:55.080 --> 17:58.800
and I mean, I don't think anything's wrong with profanity.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.040
Profanity doesn't offend me.

18:00.040 --> 18:01.980
I think we spend too much time worrying about it,

18:01.980 --> 18:04.280
but I do know that in certain contexts,

18:04.280 --> 18:06.360
it's not appreciated, right?

18:06.360 --> 18:09.220
Like I direct children's theater sometimes,

18:09.220 --> 18:10.760
and I have a hard time.

18:10.760 --> 18:13.760
I don't censor myself basically at any other part of my life,

18:13.760 --> 18:15.880
so I have a hard time sort of shutting that off.

18:15.880 --> 18:19.400
If I can't make that distinction ably,

18:19.400 --> 18:21.880
why would I expect a five-year-old to be able to do that?

18:21.880 --> 18:23.880
Oh, because your kid's gonna be way better than you.

18:23.880 --> 18:24.720
Yeah.

18:24.720 --> 18:26.600
Well, that's the hope.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.640
I mean, I guess that's sort of the dream and fear

18:28.640 --> 18:29.480
of every new parent.

18:29.480 --> 18:31.140
Well, because it'll be half Sidney,

18:31.140 --> 18:34.920
so I have to assume it'll be 50% better.

18:34.920 --> 18:37.360
Sidney curses as much as I do, though.

18:37.360 --> 18:40.240
She's not limiting herself.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.480
I just think you should swear,

18:44.480 --> 18:47.160
because is there anything better

18:47.160 --> 18:49.920
than when a little kid swears?

18:49.920 --> 18:54.920
We used to try to get Riley, Justin's little sister-in-law,

18:56.160 --> 18:58.040
to swear when she was a little tyke,

18:58.040 --> 19:00.000
because it was the fucking funniest thing ever,

19:00.000 --> 19:02.960
and it got to a point where we taught her all of them,

19:02.960 --> 19:04.520
and then we would make her say some more

19:04.520 --> 19:06.360
off-the-beaten-path stuff.

19:06.360 --> 19:10.360
Just some, let's just say, deep cuts

19:10.360 --> 19:13.260
based on troubling ideas that aren't,

19:13.260 --> 19:18.260
maybe didn't fall into the Carlinian sort of structure

19:18.840 --> 19:20.600
of what swear words traditionally are,

19:20.600 --> 19:22.760
but they were, if heard by an adult

19:22.760 --> 19:25.040
that was in charge of her well-being,

19:25.040 --> 19:27.480
would be frustrating, I think.

19:27.480 --> 19:29.200
I did enjoy that kill Whitey kick.

19:29.200 --> 19:32.080
That was a good kick that we got her on for like a bit,

19:32.080 --> 19:33.120
for like a minute,

19:33.120 --> 19:35.800
because she doesn't know what the fuck she's saying.

19:35.800 --> 19:39.360
You only have a few years where you can pull that game off,

19:39.360 --> 19:41.540
and it's the best game.

19:41.540 --> 19:43.960
Are you able to, I don't know the law and the rules,

19:43.960 --> 19:46.040
are you able to make your kid bulletproof

19:46.040 --> 19:48.200
to getting in trouble for cursing

19:48.200 --> 19:50.640
if you yourself do not believe it is a problem?

19:50.640 --> 19:52.360
I mean, that's the big hammer, right?

19:52.360 --> 19:53.640
It's like, we'll bring your parents in.

19:53.640 --> 19:55.660
If I just stare that prince in the eye and say,

19:55.660 --> 19:56.500
I don't care. Yeah, I mean,

19:56.500 --> 19:57.320
that's always the worry.

19:57.320 --> 19:58.160
I'm gonna call your dad, and you're like,

19:58.160 --> 19:59.220
yeah, no, I taught him that.

19:59.220 --> 20:02.360
Call him, get my pops on the fucking phone.

20:02.360 --> 20:03.920
Let's see how this shakes out for you.

20:03.920 --> 20:05.200
Who the fuck is this?

20:05.200 --> 20:07.880
You trying to say to my fucking kid,

20:07.880 --> 20:09.780
how about you let me take care of my own shit at home,

20:09.780 --> 20:11.120
and you keep to yourself, teach?

20:11.120 --> 20:12.760
How about you do job number one,

20:12.760 --> 20:14.400
and don't let my kid die, teach,

20:14.400 --> 20:16.880
and then I'll handle the edumacation when they get home.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.340
How does that squeal you?

20:20.080 --> 20:23.480
Are you, so where did you land vis-a-vis cursing?

20:23.480 --> 20:24.660
I don't have an answer.

20:24.660 --> 20:26.320
I mean, I guess I'll try to limit it

20:26.320 --> 20:28.800
until they're old enough to know when not to.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.640
I guess would be the question.

20:30.640 --> 20:33.640
There's a lot of things I won't expose them to

20:33.640 --> 20:36.480
when they're too young to sort of handle it, right?

20:36.480 --> 20:40.680
Like Cosmos, I don't need my kid thinking about

20:40.680 --> 20:44.080
how infinitesimal they are in the grand scheme of things

20:44.080 --> 20:45.160
when they're five.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.600
Nobody needs anything that heavy in their life.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.680
And don't let her start drinking until she's like 12

20:49.680 --> 20:51.260
and can really handle it.

20:51.260 --> 20:52.100
Yeah.

20:52.100 --> 20:52.920
Oh, crap.

20:54.600 --> 20:58.400
So are there any words that this person can use?

20:58.400 --> 21:00.080
I was sitting here trying to think of something

21:00.080 --> 21:02.060
that wouldn't get you mocked,

21:02.060 --> 21:04.700
but could still help you express your frustration

21:04.700 --> 21:05.540
at something.

21:05.540 --> 21:06.760
And all I can think of is like old-timey,

21:06.760 --> 21:10.280
like 1930s, 1940s phrases.

21:10.280 --> 21:12.760
I like ding-dang.

21:12.760 --> 21:15.240
Just like shut the ding-dang door.

21:15.240 --> 21:16.600
What about guldarnet?

21:17.600 --> 21:19.000
No, that's too prospectory.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.120
Yeah, a little prospectory.

21:20.120 --> 21:21.940
What about, I like shucks.

21:21.940 --> 21:24.840
It's simple, but effective.

21:24.840 --> 21:26.320
Crumbs is good.

21:26.320 --> 21:28.960
Yeah, crumbs is good if you're an effete

21:28.960 --> 21:32.120
British socialite in the Victorian era.

21:32.120 --> 21:34.120
Oh, crumbs.

21:34.120 --> 21:34.960
I don't know.

21:34.960 --> 21:39.960
I get into like sort of grooves with profanity,

21:39.980 --> 21:41.960
or non-profanity, I guess.

21:41.960 --> 21:43.400
Been saying hotcha-matcha a lot

21:43.400 --> 21:45.120
because I've been watching The Critic on DVD.

21:45.120 --> 21:45.960
Yeah.

21:45.960 --> 21:47.240
You can use that if you want.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.980
I catch myself saying fudge a lot,

21:48.980 --> 21:52.800
like not ironically, but just like fudge, and it feels good.

21:52.800 --> 21:57.380
I do a lot of how you doing.

21:57.380 --> 22:02.220
Like from Friends, the television show.

22:03.320 --> 22:05.920
Then when Ross would say it all the time.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.780
I think I'll ban hate speech.

22:07.780 --> 22:09.780
I don't think hate, like slurs,

22:09.780 --> 22:11.920
I will probably take a hard line against.

22:11.920 --> 22:12.760
Yeah.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.420
But see, that's, okay, this is what I love

22:14.420 --> 22:17.400
is because that is for like a really good reason.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.500
That is rude on all levels.

22:19.500 --> 22:21.200
It's bad taste, it's bad.

22:21.200 --> 22:23.080
I think expletives are just bad

22:23.080 --> 22:25.200
because someone said they were.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.800
Yeah, right?

22:26.800 --> 22:28.360
I've seen a lot of parents trying to make

22:28.360 --> 22:29.700
shut up an expletive.

22:29.700 --> 22:31.240
Come on, stupid.

22:31.240 --> 22:32.280
Or that one too.

22:32.280 --> 22:33.120
Suck.

22:33.120 --> 22:34.880
Stop it, stop it.

22:34.880 --> 22:37.280
I remember when I turned 16

22:37.280 --> 22:39.240
and I could use damn around the house

22:39.240 --> 22:40.360
as much as I wanted to.

22:40.360 --> 22:41.760
Wasn't even a big deal anymore.

22:41.760 --> 22:44.460
You got to, on your 16th name day,

22:44.460 --> 22:47.080
you were allowed to fucking pick one word

22:47.080 --> 22:48.320
that you were allowed to pick.

22:48.320 --> 22:50.880
And if that was the case, why did you go with damn?

22:51.880 --> 22:52.800
Damn is the one I use.

22:52.800 --> 22:54.440
I don't think I've said damn.

22:54.440 --> 22:57.640
I'll say god damn because if you're gonna go to town,

22:57.640 --> 22:58.880
you might as well go into Lincoln.

22:58.880 --> 23:00.120
But I don't think I've said like,

23:00.120 --> 23:01.980
stub my toe, damn.

23:01.980 --> 23:05.240
I don't think I've said that in my life.

23:05.240 --> 23:06.580
I say damn you a lot.

23:08.300 --> 23:09.260
When?

23:09.260 --> 23:12.000
Like when I am usually doing carpentry

23:12.000 --> 23:14.040
or more often than not, fuck you.

23:14.040 --> 23:14.880
But damn you is the best.

23:14.880 --> 23:15.720
When you're larping?

23:15.720 --> 23:17.960
When I'm doing carpentry.

23:17.960 --> 23:20.120
I've been playing Dark Souls too

23:20.120 --> 23:21.800
so I've been really reinvesting.

23:21.800 --> 23:26.800
It's the equivalent of going to a rededication ceremony

23:27.880 --> 23:29.980
in your marriage except with profanity.

23:29.980 --> 23:33.300
I'm rediscovering profanity, reawakening our relationship,

23:33.300 --> 23:35.160
bonding again.

23:36.160 --> 23:38.720
I just can't think of a situation where I'd wanna say damn

23:38.720 --> 23:42.000
or I wouldn't say like, shit if it's my fault

23:42.000 --> 23:43.520
or fuck if it's the thing.

23:43.520 --> 23:47.120
If I think it's the thing that I'm mad at,

23:47.120 --> 23:49.380
that it screwed up, then I'll yell fuck at it.

23:49.380 --> 23:51.240
But I don't, damn.

23:51.240 --> 23:53.800
That's the only way I can say it.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.000
Damn.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.560
I can't, it sounds weird like damn.

23:57.560 --> 24:01.040
Griffin goes full lift gal whenever he tries to say damn.

24:01.040 --> 24:01.960
It's a mystery.

24:03.720 --> 24:04.560
Oh boy.

24:04.560 --> 24:05.940
You wanna Yahoo? Please.

24:07.120 --> 24:08.720
This'll be an interesting one.

24:09.920 --> 24:13.520
It was actually sent in by Justin Minsker, my dear friend.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.720
Based on a conversation we were having the other night

24:15.720 --> 24:21.220
and then it spawned into a hunt for Yahoos.

24:21.220 --> 24:24.320
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jack X who asks,

24:24.320 --> 24:29.320
large silverback gorilla versus large male lion.

24:31.040 --> 24:33.520
The gorilla is said to be as strong as 10 to 12

24:33.520 --> 24:36.160
world strongmen or higher.

24:36.160 --> 24:37.000
What?

24:37.000 --> 24:39.720
It have massive scary arms.

24:39.720 --> 24:43.960
World strongmen, it have massive scary arms

24:43.960 --> 24:48.320
that can rip limbs with a bite of 1,000 plus,

24:48.320 --> 24:51.920
the useful hands and thumbs for grabbing.

24:51.920 --> 24:53.860
The gorilla's around 500 pounds,

24:53.860 --> 24:56.540
but obese gorilla have been around 600 pounds

24:56.540 --> 25:00.080
with deadly canines as the lion versus.

25:00.080 --> 25:02.520
The lion's is a natural predator.

25:02.520 --> 25:05.800
Their strategy is aim for throat, lock and kill.

25:05.800 --> 25:08.280
The claws can leave terrible scars.

25:09.320 --> 25:12.680
Which I'm sure the gorilla's very concerned about.

25:12.680 --> 25:14.480
Oh, damn, I got scarred.

25:14.480 --> 25:16.680
My modeling career is over.

25:16.680 --> 25:20.560
Damn, with deadly canines,

25:20.560 --> 25:23.760
large males can weigh up to 550 pounds.

25:25.800 --> 25:29.400
So that was it and we did debate this for,

25:29.400 --> 25:33.880
I mean, it was one of those arguments like cake or pie.

25:33.880 --> 25:37.940
That's just like, once you get that going, that's the night.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.120
That's like your whole night at that point.

25:41.120 --> 25:43.960
There was another one, a very popular perennial favorite

25:43.960 --> 25:46.520
among my group of friends about

25:48.360 --> 25:50.520
if you were sitting in a group of your friends

25:50.520 --> 25:52.000
and you had to poop right there,

25:52.000 --> 25:53.480
right there in that instant,

25:53.480 --> 25:56.120
would you rather do it in a diaper that you're wearing

25:56.120 --> 25:58.960
and have to be in that or do it in a bucket

25:58.960 --> 26:01.320
and then you're clean, but you just did that.

26:03.720 --> 26:04.640
Little bit off topic,

26:04.640 --> 26:06.640
I'm introducing a lot of complicated,

26:06.640 --> 26:09.200
very challenging. So if a lion has to poop in a bucket

26:09.200 --> 26:11.560
and a gorilla's wearing a diaper.

26:11.560 --> 26:12.760
You're mixing it up.

26:12.760 --> 26:14.920
The gorilla's in the bucket.

26:14.920 --> 26:16.560
We'll focus on gorilla versus lion,

26:16.560 --> 26:19.820
but you guys sort of percolate on that other subject

26:19.820 --> 26:21.560
and we can talk about it off the air.

26:21.560 --> 26:23.440
Before we get started discussing this,

26:23.440 --> 26:25.800
I have to take slight umbrage.

26:25.800 --> 26:29.920
I don't know that all of this question askers facts

26:29.920 --> 26:31.680
are correct.

26:31.680 --> 26:32.680
What's your ish?

26:32.680 --> 26:35.760
I have seen these strongman competitions

26:35.760 --> 26:38.860
and these duders can lift, let's just say low estimate,

26:38.860 --> 26:40.240
cause I can't think of a real number

26:40.240 --> 26:41.080
like I've seen them lift,

26:41.080 --> 26:43.720
but like 250 pounds.

26:43.720 --> 26:44.960
So if the gorilla-

26:44.960 --> 26:46.400
That's not much at all.

26:46.400 --> 26:48.040
That's not very much.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.840
I can easily squat 250.

26:49.840 --> 26:54.200
It's basically 800 pounds is the peak,

26:54.200 --> 26:55.440
is sort of the peak of human.

26:55.440 --> 26:56.720
Okay, great.

26:56.720 --> 26:58.080
The record is a thousand.

26:58.080 --> 26:58.920
I was looking this up

26:58.920 --> 27:03.400
because I was researching superhero power levels,

27:04.240 --> 27:07.080
strength ranges and what have you.

27:07.080 --> 27:08.720
You were building your hero clicks team.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.840
Cause they're classified.

27:10.840 --> 27:11.760
Sure.

27:11.760 --> 27:13.000
But anyway.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.960
But so if the strongman can lift 800 pounds

27:15.960 --> 27:19.500
and the gorilla can lift 10 to 12 times that.

27:21.080 --> 27:23.600
Travis, how many times have you read in the news

27:23.600 --> 27:27.560
like a chimpanzee just ripped a fucking woman's face off

27:27.560 --> 27:29.280
like it was picking a rag up off the ground.

27:29.280 --> 27:31.800
But the face isn't heavy Griffin.

27:31.800 --> 27:36.800
That's saying that this gorilla could pick up four tons.

27:36.800 --> 27:40.960
What about the scene where in Dunstan checks in

27:40.960 --> 27:45.520
where Dunstan just fucking cold clocks Jason Alexander

27:45.520 --> 27:49.560
and then drags him effortlessly up to the roof of the hotel

27:49.560 --> 27:54.000
and then throws him super far off the hotel to his death.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.040
And that's a chimpanzee.

27:55.040 --> 27:55.880
Dunstan wasn't even a goddamn gorilla.

27:55.880 --> 27:58.320
He was an orangutan you stupid bitch.

27:58.320 --> 28:01.160
He was a orangutan chimpanzee gorilla.

28:01.160 --> 28:04.540
It's all different sizes of the same goddamn animal.

28:04.540 --> 28:05.880
I'm saying gorillas are way bigger

28:05.880 --> 28:08.680
than orangutans or chimpanzees or spider monkeys

28:08.680 --> 28:11.920
which are also in their own way very, very strong,

28:11.920 --> 28:14.760
very adept at lifting and crushing and throwing.

28:14.760 --> 28:17.520
So a gorilla is lifting, throwing and crushing power.

28:17.520 --> 28:19.440
It's gonna be off the charts.

28:19.440 --> 28:21.840
Let me posit a different question.

28:21.840 --> 28:24.600
Which animal would win in a battle of wits?

28:27.000 --> 28:30.040
The one that can fucking learn and speak flawless English.

28:30.040 --> 28:33.600
And have a pet kitten, I think, basically.

28:33.600 --> 28:36.160
But then the lion could just take the kitten hostage

28:36.160 --> 28:38.040
and hold that against the gorilla.

28:38.040 --> 28:40.220
Amy, Amy, smart.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.380
Green drop, drink.

28:44.380 --> 28:46.260
I'm went gorilla all the way.

28:46.260 --> 28:48.040
Maybe this doesn't even need to be discussed

28:48.040 --> 28:50.700
because it seems like the logical answer

28:50.700 --> 28:52.440
like a lion can jump up there and scratch

28:52.440 --> 28:54.920
and leave terrible scars and it can bite.

28:54.920 --> 28:56.200
It'll go for the throat.

28:56.200 --> 28:58.040
Gorilla has fucking hands.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.880
It has human hands.

28:59.880 --> 29:02.240
It can just grab the lion and just tear it in half.

29:02.240 --> 29:06.760
The problem is that I see is like lions are a pack hunter.

29:07.920 --> 29:08.760
You know what I mean?

29:08.760 --> 29:09.580
They run things.

29:09.580 --> 29:12.160
So you wanna give fucking team lion five other lions.

29:12.160 --> 29:14.760
I'm just saying like if it's multiple lions,

29:14.760 --> 29:15.760
you give it to the lion.

29:15.760 --> 29:18.160
But that's why lions are able to take down

29:18.160 --> 29:21.280
like gigantic animals because they don't do it

29:21.280 --> 29:22.400
by themselves.

29:22.400 --> 29:23.960
How about we get the money's in?

29:24.960 --> 29:26.400
We didn't really answer the question.

29:26.400 --> 29:29.560
Well, it's pretty obvious to me that I think it's a gorilla

29:29.560 --> 29:33.520
because they're smarter and they can sign for help.

29:35.520 --> 29:36.360
From other.

29:36.360 --> 29:39.060
I'm gonna go lion just because I like an underdog.

29:39.060 --> 29:40.720
They climb up a tree.

29:40.720 --> 29:43.120
They use their jungle wifi.

29:43.120 --> 29:45.160
They get on Amazon.

29:45.160 --> 29:47.040
They buy goddamn lion poison.

29:47.040 --> 29:48.720
They're not Gilligan.

29:48.720 --> 29:51.040
They're not inventing shit.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.620
They're just like smarter.

29:52.620 --> 29:54.160
And I think they could come up with this strategy.

29:54.160 --> 29:58.000
I feel like the lion would maybe go

29:58.000 --> 29:59.800
to where the fight was gonna be

29:59.800 --> 30:01.160
and step in the wrong place.

30:01.160 --> 30:02.940
And there would be like a primitive trap,

30:02.940 --> 30:04.160
like a net.

30:04.160 --> 30:05.000
Definitely.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.760
And then the gorillas would just throw small rocks at it.

30:07.760 --> 30:09.640
And the gorilla would come out and take off its monocle

30:09.640 --> 30:12.640
and say, you've fallen into my trap, dear lion.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.440
Yeah, you've fought gorilla growled.

30:14.440 --> 30:16.400
What a terrible decision.

30:16.400 --> 30:21.400
And then it would drink a large gulp of its homemade wine

30:21.720 --> 30:24.840
from the hollowed out skull of Jason Alexander.

30:24.840 --> 30:28.560
Here's an unpopular opinion.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.320
I think the soundtrack to Tarzan is better

30:30.320 --> 30:31.720
than the soundtrack to Lion King.

30:31.720 --> 30:32.560
Case closed.

30:40.200 --> 30:42.120
Why is that even germane?

30:42.120 --> 30:45.360
You gotta think about brand recognition in this battle too.

30:45.360 --> 30:47.760
Can we please now go to the money zone?

30:47.760 --> 30:58.600
Absolutely.

30:58.600 --> 31:00.180
Listeners, we love you.

31:00.180 --> 31:03.720
We have to tell you, you are so just,

31:03.720 --> 31:05.760
you're such an ingrateful old twerp.

31:05.760 --> 31:07.300
You know that?

31:07.300 --> 31:08.140
You know that?

31:08.140 --> 31:11.800
When was the last time you did something nice for moms?

31:11.800 --> 31:13.240
For any, well, for anyone.

31:13.240 --> 31:15.040
Yeah, Travis, for starters.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.920
But how about the person that pushed you

31:17.920 --> 31:22.400
either through their vagina or their tummy

31:22.400 --> 31:24.360
or they adopted you,

31:24.360 --> 31:26.840
which is still a significant amount of work,

31:26.840 --> 31:29.240
I bet, a lot of paperwork and logistics.

31:30.120 --> 31:32.620
You gotta do something nice for them this Mother's Day.

31:32.620 --> 31:34.840
So how about you make it rain

31:35.760 --> 31:39.440
a hundred beautiful blooms in a bouquet

31:39.440 --> 31:42.620
and a free glass vase from proflowers.com

31:42.620 --> 31:44.640
for just $19.99.

31:44.640 --> 31:46.080
A hundred blooms?

31:46.080 --> 31:50.640
A hundred blooms, make it rain from the sky blooms

31:50.640 --> 31:51.480
on your suite.

31:51.480 --> 31:52.620
I don't think she'll be able to process

31:52.620 --> 31:54.360
how many blooms that is.

31:54.360 --> 31:55.200
No, she'll start to count.

31:55.200 --> 31:56.200
So you make her sit down

31:56.200 --> 31:58.000
and count every single one of them.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.260
You count every bloom, Diane.

32:02.040 --> 32:03.840
Count and number the blooms.

32:05.400 --> 32:08.200
You can also upgrade that.

32:08.200 --> 32:09.020
That's already sick.

32:09.020 --> 32:09.920
That's already crazy.

32:09.920 --> 32:13.560
Proflowers, they are a returning sponsor for us.

32:13.560 --> 32:16.040
We have all received flowers from proflowers

32:16.040 --> 32:17.680
that were really, really nice

32:17.680 --> 32:22.040
and they lasted a crazy amount of time.

32:22.040 --> 32:23.480
They sent me a new bouquet

32:23.480 --> 32:25.960
to celebrate this new partnership

32:25.960 --> 32:30.960
on the like two weeks ago this Saturday

32:31.360 --> 32:32.880
that are still looking great.

32:32.880 --> 32:34.240
I think they're cursed.

32:34.240 --> 32:35.080
Yeah.

32:35.080 --> 32:36.240
I think they're beautiful

32:36.240 --> 32:38.200
and I'm not saying that it has any kind

32:38.200 --> 32:39.520
of detrimental effect.

32:39.520 --> 32:40.720
They're definitely cursed.

32:40.720 --> 32:42.560
Yeah, I'm really worried what happens

32:42.560 --> 32:44.200
when the last petal falls.

32:45.200 --> 32:47.880
Yeah, in two years from now.

32:47.880 --> 32:51.560
So that's a great deal.

32:51.560 --> 32:53.600
You can also upgrade to 100 blooms

32:53.600 --> 32:55.520
with a pink vase and chocolates

32:55.520 --> 32:57.960
for just 9.99 more.

32:57.960 --> 33:01.260
So, you know, 29.99, you can get that deal.

33:02.240 --> 33:04.340
You can get that special price

33:04.340 --> 33:06.160
on your Mother's Day order

33:06.160 --> 33:10.180
if you go to their website, proflowers.com,

33:10.180 --> 33:12.300
click on the blue mic up in the corner

33:12.300 --> 33:15.160
and use the code MYBROTHER, all one word,

33:15.160 --> 33:18.360
and you will get that, the 100 blooms for 9.99

33:18.360 --> 33:21.040
or the extra special vase and chocolates

33:21.040 --> 33:23.040
for an extra 10 spot.

33:24.200 --> 33:25.040
Great deal.

33:25.040 --> 33:25.880
Yeah.

33:25.880 --> 33:27.440
They're great, they really are great flowers.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.920
Like, I don't know, like I don't,

33:29.920 --> 33:31.460
I'm not super into flowers,

33:31.460 --> 33:33.160
but game recognize game.

33:33.160 --> 33:34.080
You know what I mean?

33:34.080 --> 33:35.680
These are some dank flowers.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.280
They last forever.

33:37.280 --> 33:39.520
Wow, and this deal is expiring soon.

33:39.520 --> 33:43.060
Yeah, it's, I mean, it's expiring.

33:43.060 --> 33:44.460
Friday at midnight.

33:44.460 --> 33:45.300
Oh, fuck.

33:45.300 --> 33:46.700
Yeah, so get on it.

33:46.700 --> 33:48.920
Get in there right now.

33:48.920 --> 33:50.360
So you go to proflowers.com,

33:50.360 --> 33:52.300
click the blue microphone and type in MYBROTHER.

33:52.300 --> 33:53.800
Now, go do it, don't wait.

33:53.800 --> 33:54.640
Go do it.

33:55.960 --> 33:57.880
Yeah, that's it for that commercial.

33:57.880 --> 33:59.180
That was a good commercial, Griffin,

33:59.180 --> 34:00.240
but now I'm fat.

34:01.800 --> 34:02.640
From the commercial?

34:02.640 --> 34:06.080
The commercial was, I ate that whole box of chocolates

34:06.080 --> 34:08.580
and now I'm fat.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.340
So help me.

34:10.340 --> 34:11.240
Someone help me.

34:11.240 --> 34:13.740
One of you two has to have some idea for healthy snacking

34:13.740 --> 34:15.800
that comes in a box from Nature.

34:17.300 --> 34:19.300
Well, I mean, you've given me so many clues.

34:19.300 --> 34:21.500
Mother's Day is just around the corner

34:21.500 --> 34:26.500
and Mother Nature has made you some snacks

34:26.620 --> 34:29.020
and you can get them in a box from Nature Box.

34:29.020 --> 34:30.940
Don't eat crap from the vending machine.

34:30.940 --> 34:32.740
Put down the Funyuns, Tubbo.

34:32.740 --> 34:36.280
It's time to get right with your health

34:36.280 --> 34:37.940
and Nature Box is gonna help you do that.

34:37.940 --> 34:39.940
It's like a subscription service

34:39.940 --> 34:43.980
and you pick new snacks every month

34:43.980 --> 34:46.920
and they send you just like a gigantic box

34:46.920 --> 34:48.560
of super healthy snacks.

34:48.560 --> 34:50.300
It doesn't have artificial stuff.

34:50.300 --> 34:53.980
It doesn't have high fructose corn or fats,

34:53.980 --> 34:55.380
transitive fats or anything.

34:55.380 --> 34:57.500
It doesn't have anything bad for you.

34:57.500 --> 34:58.460
It's basically air.

34:58.460 --> 34:59.300
Transitive fats?

34:59.300 --> 35:00.380
Trans fats, I misread it.

35:00.380 --> 35:01.220
It doesn't have any of that.

35:01.220 --> 35:05.420
Transitive fats, so if fat A equals fat B, then right.

35:05.420 --> 35:06.820
Sure.

35:06.820 --> 35:09.460
Yeah, no, that's a great math goof that you did

35:09.460 --> 35:12.780
based on all of the math knowledge you still possess.

35:12.780 --> 35:14.660
If A equals B and B equals C, then A equals C.

35:14.660 --> 35:15.920
This is transitive property.

35:15.920 --> 35:17.460
Look it up.

35:17.460 --> 35:18.340
Wow.

35:18.340 --> 35:19.900
You really pulled it out there.

35:19.900 --> 35:21.500
And here's the great thing about Nature Box.

35:21.500 --> 35:22.940
Not only is it delicious, they've got great stuff

35:22.940 --> 35:24.780
like South Pacific plantain chips, everything,

35:24.780 --> 35:27.820
bagel sticks, BBQ kettle kernels.

35:27.820 --> 35:30.620
You know, Pro Flowers has sent me flowers three times

35:30.620 --> 35:32.540
and I've only got one free Nature Box,

35:32.540 --> 35:34.180
so I would really like to dip into some of these

35:34.180 --> 35:36.740
new flavors if you're listening in B.

35:36.740 --> 35:40.460
And they're gonna send you your first box half off

35:40.460 --> 35:43.420
if you use our hookup for you.

35:43.420 --> 35:46.540
It's naturebox.com forward slash my brother.

35:46.540 --> 35:49.920
Naturebox.com slash my brother.

35:51.220 --> 35:53.260
It's time to get into the swimsuit.

35:53.260 --> 35:54.860
It's time to get into the trunks.

35:54.860 --> 35:58.620
It's time to get into your Louis Vuitton bikini.

35:58.620 --> 36:00.740
And Nature Box.

36:00.740 --> 36:02.580
My ocean jeggings.

36:02.580 --> 36:03.980
Your jorts.

36:03.980 --> 36:05.980
My lake jorts.

36:05.980 --> 36:08.100
Get into your lake jorts.

36:08.100 --> 36:09.180
Stay full, stay strong.

36:09.180 --> 36:11.380
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother

36:11.380 --> 36:13.900
and get some half off snacks that you're really,

36:13.900 --> 36:15.780
really genuinely going to enjoy.

36:19.940 --> 36:22.980
Listen, I have bad news for everybody listening to this show.

36:22.980 --> 36:25.320
Your boss is trying to fuck you.

36:25.320 --> 36:28.380
Not literally, although probably,

36:28.380 --> 36:30.880
because once you get to that point,

36:30.880 --> 36:34.020
the creep mode just like turns on regardless.

36:34.020 --> 36:36.700
But also it's your fault in a way for getting so healthy

36:36.700 --> 36:37.820
and right with Nature Box.

36:37.820 --> 36:40.100
You got super healthy for Nature Box.

36:40.100 --> 36:41.980
You smell good because you've been close

36:41.980 --> 36:43.740
to pro-flowers flowers all day.

36:44.640 --> 36:45.620
What you're gonna need to do

36:45.620 --> 36:47.860
is you're gonna need to download WorkLog.

36:47.860 --> 36:52.540
It is an app application that you can find on Android.

36:52.540 --> 36:55.400
And you can keep track of how long you have worked.

36:56.340 --> 36:59.220
So like if you think your boss is shaving hours

36:59.220 --> 37:02.580
off of your paycheck, WorkLog makes it quick and easy

37:02.580 --> 37:05.700
to track how many hours you actually have worked.

37:05.700 --> 37:07.520
You can see how much you've worked in a week or a month

37:07.520 --> 37:10.000
or whatever the pay period is.

37:10.000 --> 37:14.080
And you can use time-saving features like auto break,

37:14.080 --> 37:18.760
which figures out how many breaks you've taken in a shift.

37:18.760 --> 37:20.440
And you can do all that.

37:20.440 --> 37:22.020
And then when the old paycheck comes around

37:22.020 --> 37:24.640
and they're like, you worked 32 hours this week,

37:24.640 --> 37:27.220
you can be like, fucking check again, Barry.

37:27.220 --> 37:29.080
And then he will check again.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.200
Please don't use this for evil.

37:31.200 --> 37:33.220
Please don't use this to just stop coming in

37:33.220 --> 37:35.280
and then flash your WorkLog at the end of the week

37:35.280 --> 37:37.420
and say, hey, I think I was here.

37:37.420 --> 37:38.260
My phone's at the-

37:38.260 --> 37:39.220
And your boss says, I'm sorry,

37:39.220 --> 37:40.940
I've never seen you before in my life.

37:40.940 --> 37:42.100
I've never seen you.

37:42.100 --> 37:44.700
Shut your fucking idiot mouth, Barry.

37:44.700 --> 37:45.780
And you whip it out.

37:45.780 --> 37:46.620
Well, okay.

37:46.620 --> 37:47.440
I didn't weep.

37:47.440 --> 37:49.380
It says 40 hours, so.

37:49.380 --> 37:50.620
Anyway, that's WorkLog.

37:50.620 --> 37:51.660
It's on Android.

37:51.660 --> 37:54.340
Check it out on the Google Play Store.

37:54.340 --> 37:55.180
It's free.

37:55.180 --> 37:56.300
You have nothing to lose.

37:56.300 --> 37:57.140
Go get it.

37:57.140 --> 37:59.540
This next message is from Mike Vera McCann

37:59.540 --> 38:02.140
and it's from Angie Vera McCann.

38:02.140 --> 38:05.140
Angie says, Mike, happy one year anniversary.

38:05.140 --> 38:06.900
I'm glad that we are wifeys.

38:06.900 --> 38:09.300
I am also glad that we both forgot it was our anniversary

38:09.300 --> 38:11.980
until our moms sent us cards to remind us.

38:11.980 --> 38:14.620
You're my number one man with dishpan hands.

38:14.620 --> 38:15.940
I'm going to blame our favorite brothers

38:15.940 --> 38:17.500
for the tardiness of this message.

38:17.500 --> 38:18.500
Nice.

38:18.500 --> 38:20.140
Meet me in the smoochitorium.

38:20.140 --> 38:22.420
XOXO, Angie.

38:22.420 --> 38:23.620
That's nice.

38:23.620 --> 38:25.540
I know we said they could do that,

38:25.540 --> 38:27.180
but it does sting a little bit.

38:27.180 --> 38:28.020
It hurts.

38:28.020 --> 38:29.620
They blame us and it's not our fault.

38:29.620 --> 38:30.820
It also takes a little bit of the power away from it

38:30.820 --> 38:34.180
when you tell Mike you are blaming us for it.

38:34.180 --> 38:36.700
It's just we fuck this up so frequently

38:36.700 --> 38:38.320
that when we actually get it right

38:38.320 --> 38:41.380
and we get blamed for the fuck up anyway,

38:41.380 --> 38:43.360
I'll be honest, it stings a little bit.

38:43.360 --> 38:47.040
Also, I should mention that if you're gonna blame us

38:47.040 --> 38:49.200
for tardiness, it's probably best to not say

38:49.200 --> 38:53.260
that you definitely forgot in your message, Moriarty.

38:53.260 --> 38:55.840
Nice try on the crime of the century.

38:55.840 --> 38:57.100
I don't think you're gonna get away with it,

38:57.100 --> 38:59.500
but we do wish you a very happy anniversary

38:59.500 --> 39:01.820
to both of you and we're so happy

39:01.820 --> 39:02.660
that you're still together.

39:02.660 --> 39:04.580
Please, you're our favorite celeb couple.

39:04.580 --> 39:05.900
Never split.

39:05.900 --> 39:06.780
Mangy.

39:06.780 --> 39:07.720
Mangy.

39:09.300 --> 39:10.860
I know, you mean Mangy?

39:10.860 --> 39:11.700
No, stop.

39:11.700 --> 39:12.580
Mangy.

39:12.580 --> 39:13.420
Mangy.

39:14.620 --> 39:15.860
What up, dog?

39:15.860 --> 39:20.020
It's your boy Jasper Redd, co-host of The Goose Down,

39:20.020 --> 39:22.140
along with Kimberly Clark,

39:22.140 --> 39:24.820
and some of y'all might be asking yourself,

39:24.820 --> 39:27.580
what the hell is The Goose Down?

39:27.580 --> 39:29.340
It's a comforted fool,

39:29.340 --> 39:31.900
and we want y'all to climb underneath it with us

39:31.900 --> 39:34.820
and snuggle up so we can fondle your ears and things.

39:34.820 --> 39:38.300
So come check us out at Maximalfun.org,

39:38.300 --> 39:40.700
also available on iTunes.

39:40.700 --> 39:41.940
Jill.

39:41.940 --> 39:45.020
I am a standup comic, but I'm also a youth pastor.

39:45.020 --> 39:47.740
Oh man, I hope you enjoyed.

39:47.740 --> 39:50.560
I hope you enjoyed our profanity section.

39:50.560 --> 39:52.740
I know there is much deserved stigma

39:52.740 --> 39:54.500
associated with Christian comedians.

39:54.500 --> 39:56.340
I wouldn't even consider myself one.

39:56.340 --> 39:58.820
I'm a comedian who just so happens to be Christian.

39:58.820 --> 40:01.000
I'm also a huge Bim Bam and Max Fun fan,

40:01.000 --> 40:03.040
so that's just to show I have an actual sense of humor.

40:03.040 --> 40:04.860
How do I get people to take me seriously in comedy

40:04.860 --> 40:07.500
without completely hiding this other part of my life?

40:07.500 --> 40:10.040
And that's from Embarrassed in the Bible Belt.

40:11.040 --> 40:13.600
You know, my friend's dad is a standup comic,

40:13.600 --> 40:18.600
and his whole thing is that he does clean comedy.

40:18.840 --> 40:19.680
You know what I mean?

40:19.680 --> 40:22.180
And he gets so much work

40:22.180 --> 40:27.180
doing stuff at dinners and at clubs,

40:27.620 --> 40:31.380
and family kind of venues, that it's not-

40:31.380 --> 40:35.580
Yeah, I don't think standup comedy necessarily has to be,

40:35.580 --> 40:38.540
I mean, like Jim Gaffigan, for instance.

40:38.540 --> 40:42.940
Almost all of his stuff is super, super fam friend,

40:42.940 --> 40:45.460
you know, like the whole Blue Collar Comedy Tour.

40:46.700 --> 40:51.120
Not that I'm equating what you or Jim Gaffigan do

40:51.120 --> 40:55.180
to that atrocity, but it's not an atrocity.

40:55.180 --> 40:56.060
I fucking love it.

40:56.060 --> 40:57.980
I'm not gonna put on airs.

40:57.980 --> 40:59.040
Yeah, here's your sign.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.260
I think- Oh God.

41:01.260 --> 41:03.500
I think that if what you're looking for

41:03.500 --> 41:07.100
is sort of like work, like if you wanna work,

41:07.100 --> 41:09.740
I think that having a clean show

41:09.740 --> 41:11.500
and a family friendly show,

41:11.500 --> 41:13.140
you're probably gonna work a lot more.

41:13.140 --> 41:16.260
If you want acceptance, like you wanna be liked

41:16.260 --> 41:19.020
and well regarded by your fellow comedians,

41:19.020 --> 41:21.580
I think that like, they're probably looking

41:21.580 --> 41:22.980
for something a little edgier.

41:22.980 --> 41:24.560
I think if you're not pushing the envelope,

41:24.560 --> 41:26.500
maybe in that scene, maybe,

41:26.500 --> 41:28.740
I don't know that scene very well.

41:28.740 --> 41:30.100
Well, hold, let me say this.

41:30.100 --> 41:32.140
I think it's probably a lot like music,

41:32.140 --> 41:36.220
is you could do stuff that you think would be more mainstream

41:36.220 --> 41:40.540
and more popular, but I mean, if that's not your style,

41:40.540 --> 41:43.580
if that's not the thing you wanna do,

41:43.580 --> 41:47.040
then I don't think it'll be as good as the stuff

41:47.040 --> 41:49.220
that fits in with your personality

41:49.220 --> 41:51.260
and your kind of MO, you know what I mean?

41:51.260 --> 41:53.140
Like don't tell jokes just because,

41:53.140 --> 41:56.020
and don't be edgy just to be edgy, you know what I mean?

41:56.020 --> 41:58.340
I think go out there and make the jokes you wanna make

41:58.340 --> 42:00.460
and do the show you wanna do.

42:00.460 --> 42:01.380
That's true, Jeff.

42:01.380 --> 42:02.580
Being true to yourself here,

42:02.580 --> 42:03.800
I think is the best thing you can do

42:03.800 --> 42:08.800
because if you are someone who does have a sense of humor,

42:10.020 --> 42:11.800
is very open, is not sort of,

42:11.800 --> 42:13.780
I think that the stigma you're worried about

42:13.780 --> 42:16.700
is somebody being sort of uptight and stuffy.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.180
If you're very clearly not that,

42:18.180 --> 42:21.260
then not only are you gonna just be able to be yourself,

42:21.260 --> 42:24.580
but you might change some hearts and minds

42:24.580 --> 42:26.660
in terms of what being a Christian could mean,

42:26.660 --> 42:29.660
which could be super, super cool, maybe.

42:31.300 --> 42:36.300
I just think you can be anything and also be super funny.

42:38.660 --> 42:41.500
The talk about trying to fit in and be like,

42:42.420 --> 42:44.660
I don't think that there's a standard of what,

42:44.660 --> 42:46.060
there definitely is a standard of what

42:46.060 --> 42:47.300
a stand-up comic is,

42:47.300 --> 42:49.280
but I don't think those are the stand-up comics

42:49.280 --> 42:51.580
that anybody really likes.

42:51.580 --> 42:56.400
Like I actually just went to this stand-up comedy competition

42:56.400 --> 42:59.420
that's a pretty big deal here in Austin

42:59.420 --> 43:02.380
that they get like 15 comics up on stage in a night

43:02.380 --> 43:04.860
and they go through like 12 preliminary rounds.

43:04.860 --> 43:06.760
It's called Funniest Person in Austin.

43:08.020 --> 43:10.980
And of those like 15 or so,

43:10.980 --> 43:13.940
there were like five or six people

43:13.940 --> 43:18.060
that were just like incredibly funny, incredibly original.

43:18.060 --> 43:19.680
You could remember their names at the end.

43:19.680 --> 43:22.060
You could remember like the best stuff that they did

43:22.060 --> 43:23.420
because they were themselves

43:23.420 --> 43:25.620
and they weren't like trying to fit into this

43:28.340 --> 43:32.180
identikit of like, I'm gonna tell a joke about my wife now.

43:32.180 --> 43:34.280
Like there were definitely,

43:34.280 --> 43:36.540
everybody else was kind of that though.

43:36.540 --> 43:37.860
And they were the people who like,

43:37.860 --> 43:40.220
they may have had some good goofs in there,

43:40.220 --> 43:42.820
but they weren't, none of them like won.

43:42.820 --> 43:44.220
Like none of them move on to the next round.

43:44.220 --> 43:45.260
None of them were the people

43:45.260 --> 43:47.060
that you really remembered at the end.

43:47.060 --> 43:49.800
Like originality I think is the most important thing

43:49.800 --> 43:51.780
you can bring to the table

43:51.780 --> 43:54.180
in the stand-up comedy scene,

43:54.180 --> 43:56.100
regardless of where you are.

43:56.100 --> 43:57.100
If you're a Christian,

43:57.100 --> 43:59.300
if your angle is that you're a Christian

43:59.300 --> 44:01.900
who's willing to get raw and rippled,

44:01.900 --> 44:04.340
I think that is going to be an angle

44:04.340 --> 44:07.200
that you can exploit all the way to the bank.

44:07.200 --> 44:09.380
Well, cause I think it's not only originality,

44:09.380 --> 44:11.140
but also sincerity, you know what I mean?

44:11.140 --> 44:15.700
Like I would never want to watch anybody tell jokes

44:15.700 --> 44:18.180
that they didn't think were funny.

44:18.180 --> 44:21.340
Like that just sounds like the fucking worst thing ever.

44:21.340 --> 44:23.540
Just go out there and do your show, dude.

44:23.540 --> 44:26.260
And you know, I like the aspect of your question.

44:26.260 --> 44:27.580
I think it's interesting that idea

44:27.580 --> 44:29.740
of like having to hide the other aspect.

44:29.740 --> 44:31.300
Cause I could imagine a situation

44:31.300 --> 44:32.580
in which you might be on a bill

44:32.580 --> 44:35.620
with like three other comedians who, you know,

44:35.620 --> 44:39.100
are not following the same lifestyle you do.

44:39.100 --> 44:42.700
But I mean, don't, you know, don't be stuffy about it.

44:42.700 --> 44:44.340
It doesn't sound like you would be.

44:44.340 --> 44:45.460
And who cares, you know?

44:45.460 --> 44:48.820
And other way around is if you are a youth minister

44:48.820 --> 44:50.900
and you have, you know, a congregation,

44:51.780 --> 44:54.440
if you are worried about them seeing your act,

44:54.440 --> 44:56.340
then don't do stuff in your act

44:56.340 --> 44:58.040
you wouldn't want them to see.

44:58.040 --> 44:59.700
Or you wouldn't, more specifically,

44:59.700 --> 45:01.440
you wouldn't want Jesus to see.

45:01.440 --> 45:02.280
Exactly.

45:02.280 --> 45:03.100
Cause he'll see.

45:03.100 --> 45:03.940
He'll see anything.

45:03.940 --> 45:07.140
He watches all your bits and he does keep copious notes.

45:07.140 --> 45:09.140
He will tell you the ones he does not like.

45:09.140 --> 45:11.060
He will tell you, oh, he'll be honest with you.

45:11.060 --> 45:12.060
Oh, you bombed.

45:12.060 --> 45:13.100
You bombed there.

45:13.100 --> 45:14.460
You did very bad.

45:14.460 --> 45:17.220
He is the most honest, but also like supportive.

45:17.220 --> 45:18.820
You know, that's what I love about Jesus

45:18.820 --> 45:19.660
is he'll sit there and go,

45:19.660 --> 45:23.140
hey, the goof about the blue dog, totally killed.

45:23.140 --> 45:25.380
But the one thing about the cold hamburger,

45:25.380 --> 45:26.620
you gotta lose it.

45:26.620 --> 45:29.440
Yeah, listen, my patience is eternal.

45:29.440 --> 45:31.520
And even I was getting bored.

45:31.520 --> 45:32.360
I mean.

45:32.360 --> 45:34.940
You did have a few jokes in there about abortion.

45:34.940 --> 45:37.420
I am gonna need you to just go ahead

45:37.420 --> 45:38.580
and cut those out of the bit.

45:38.580 --> 45:39.400
Thank you.

45:39.400 --> 45:40.240
Don't think it's funny.

45:40.240 --> 45:41.940
Love all the little babies.

45:41.940 --> 45:43.980
Love all the babies.

45:43.980 --> 45:45.740
Let's just say you're not on the right side

45:45.740 --> 45:47.120
of history on this one.

45:47.120 --> 45:48.640
Yeah.

45:48.640 --> 45:51.740
Don't invite Jesus to come see the show.

45:51.740 --> 45:53.620
Cause he'll find out about it.

45:53.620 --> 45:54.460
Guaranteed.

45:54.460 --> 45:55.280
He will find out about it.

45:55.280 --> 45:56.360
He always knows.

45:57.380 --> 45:58.600
He knows when you are sleeping

45:58.600 --> 46:00.700
and he knows when you are awake.

46:00.700 --> 46:02.480
He knows if you've been bad or good.

46:02.480 --> 46:04.620
And he's not gonna do the two drink minimum.

46:04.620 --> 46:07.020
Not even interested.

46:07.020 --> 46:08.420
No, I'll make my own.

46:08.420 --> 46:09.500
Bring me some water.

46:09.500 --> 46:10.340
Thank you.

46:10.340 --> 46:11.180
Thank you.

46:11.180 --> 46:15.140
Do you guys want Yahoo?

46:15.140 --> 46:16.580
Yes, I do.

46:16.580 --> 46:19.020
This Yahoo was sent in by Drew Davenport,

46:19.020 --> 46:22.780
Emerald member, level six Yahoo shaman.

46:22.780 --> 46:24.460
Thank you, Drew.

46:24.460 --> 46:27.380
It's by Yahoo Answers user Blondie who asks,

46:27.380 --> 46:29.060
I kissed a guy a year ago.

46:29.060 --> 46:31.060
Is his spit still in my mouth?

46:32.580 --> 46:34.040
Last year I made out with a guy.

46:34.040 --> 46:35.780
Is his spit still in my mouth?

46:35.780 --> 46:38.420
Update, was his spit ever in my mouth?

46:38.420 --> 46:41.020
Update two, I had sex with him too.

46:42.220 --> 46:45.180
But you're more concerned with the spit.

46:45.180 --> 46:47.360
Yeah, cause spit's super gross.

46:47.360 --> 46:51.100
I guess it depends on if you've spit since then.

46:52.660 --> 46:54.620
You're saying if you kept your mouth closed,

46:54.620 --> 46:56.940
then you would have all the same spit from that night.

46:56.940 --> 46:59.680
Sort of an extended version of like,

46:59.680 --> 47:00.720
I'm never washing the hand

47:00.720 --> 47:02.940
that I shook George Takei's hand with kind of thing.

47:02.940 --> 47:03.780
Exactly.

47:03.780 --> 47:04.620
Sure.

47:04.620 --> 47:07.100
I kissed the inside of George Takei's mouth

47:07.100 --> 47:11.160
and I got a full mouthful of George Takei's spit.

47:12.260 --> 47:13.700
And then I kept my mouth closed

47:13.700 --> 47:16.220
and I haven't spoken or swallowed since that day.

47:16.220 --> 47:17.860
I am drowning, please help.

47:17.860 --> 47:19.100
I'm drowning, I'm drowning.

47:19.100 --> 47:21.740
I'm dry drowning on land, on Takei.

47:22.980 --> 47:25.580
If every breath you take has one molecule

47:25.580 --> 47:30.220
of Caesar's last breath, as we all know, that is true.

47:30.220 --> 47:32.900
I would assume that molecules of spit

47:32.900 --> 47:34.660
probably dissipate.

47:34.660 --> 47:37.840
Wait a minute, why do you want to know this?

47:37.840 --> 47:39.060
What are you asking?

47:39.060 --> 47:39.880
Why is this person asking?

47:39.880 --> 47:40.720
Yeah, oh wait, hold on.

47:40.720 --> 47:41.980
Yeah, I wanna dive into this.

47:41.980 --> 47:43.360
What situation are you in

47:43.360 --> 47:44.960
in which you have to determine this?

47:44.960 --> 47:46.500
Has to be Voodoo Curse.

47:46.500 --> 47:49.900
Has to be 100%, no question, Voodoo Curse,

47:49.900 --> 47:52.180
not even DNA analysis.

47:52.180 --> 47:53.880
Or like a location spell?

47:54.740 --> 47:56.420
Cloning?

47:56.420 --> 47:59.220
You can't separate the molecules for cloning.

47:59.220 --> 48:01.200
It can't be anything scientific

48:01.200 --> 48:03.780
because you can't scientifically assess this.

48:03.780 --> 48:06.240
However, if we are in black magics,

48:07.340 --> 48:10.140
you wouldn't need numbers to quantify it.

48:10.140 --> 48:14.380
You would just need the existence of the spirit.

48:14.380 --> 48:16.260
Why do you immediately jump to black magic?

48:16.260 --> 48:17.820
It could be white magic.

48:17.820 --> 48:19.380
It could be like a eye.

48:19.380 --> 48:22.420
If it was white magic, you would call him

48:22.420 --> 48:24.140
and ask him for more spit.

48:24.140 --> 48:25.860
But what if he's missing?

48:26.700 --> 48:28.460
You think it's a location, okay.

48:28.460 --> 48:29.300
So you're saying location spell.

48:29.300 --> 48:30.180
I'm saying you're trying to find him.

48:30.180 --> 48:32.580
You haven't seen him in a year and you're worried.

48:32.580 --> 48:33.980
If you're gonna harness the power

48:33.980 --> 48:35.700
of Yahoo Answers to do something,

48:35.700 --> 48:38.100
maybe ask has anybody seen Doug?

48:39.460 --> 48:41.740
Have not seen Doug in years.

48:41.740 --> 48:42.580
Need help.

48:43.900 --> 48:45.660
Voodoo Priestess, welcome.

48:45.660 --> 48:48.060
I love Doug, does he have big tits?

48:48.060 --> 48:49.700
I'm on Yahoo Answers.

48:51.540 --> 48:52.380
Your Doug sucks.

48:52.380 --> 48:54.780
Everyone on Yahoo Answers is 13

48:54.780 --> 48:56.360
and doesn't know what tites are.

48:56.360 --> 48:57.260
That's what they call them

48:57.260 --> 48:58.740
because they don't even know how to pronounce that word.

48:58.740 --> 49:02.580
I watch Doug every afternoon on Nickelodeon.

49:02.580 --> 49:04.820
They don't, they don't because they're 14

49:04.820 --> 49:07.300
and that's just not on the air anymore.

49:07.300 --> 49:10.340
My parents let me watch MTV whenever I want.

49:10.340 --> 49:12.180
If I kissed a guy a year ago,

49:12.180 --> 49:13.500
is his spit still in my mouth?

49:13.500 --> 49:15.900
I mean, your mouth is fibrous.

49:15.900 --> 49:16.940
It's spongy.

49:16.940 --> 49:20.120
Well, let's finish that question

49:20.120 --> 49:24.140
with a second half of the sentence because blank.

49:24.140 --> 49:27.180
Because all I can think is I kissed a guy a year ago,

49:27.180 --> 49:29.180
is his spit still in my mouth

49:29.180 --> 49:31.280
because I can hear his thoughts.

49:32.780 --> 49:35.180
Or maybe you just want to know.

49:35.180 --> 49:37.780
Just like, I just thought about kissing Dave

49:37.780 --> 49:39.460
at last year's New Year's Eve party

49:39.460 --> 49:40.660
and now I want to know.

49:40.660 --> 49:43.100
Do I still got a little bit of Dave in my mouth?

49:43.100 --> 49:45.400
Maybe do I have a carry, Dave, your spit.

49:45.400 --> 49:47.180
I carry it in my spit.

49:47.180 --> 49:48.580
That's even coming to me.

49:48.580 --> 49:49.860
I was just kind of let you know.

49:49.860 --> 49:51.740
I'm thinking about if your spit's in my mouth.

49:51.740 --> 49:53.440
You want to grab dinner sometime?

49:54.760 --> 49:56.580
Maybe get some more spit up in there?

49:56.580 --> 49:57.420
Just food for thought.

49:57.420 --> 49:58.860
You can put spit wherever you want.

49:58.860 --> 49:59.700
In my mouth?

49:59.700 --> 50:00.540
Mostly in my mouth, please.

50:00.540 --> 50:02.840
Maybe this person is gonna see Doug again

50:02.840 --> 50:04.980
and they need a conversation starter.

50:06.100 --> 50:09.780
You know, funny, I was reading on the internet.

50:09.780 --> 50:12.540
I don't remember if you remember when we kissed a year ago

50:12.540 --> 50:13.420
and then had sex.

50:14.460 --> 50:16.460
I think of them in that order.

50:16.460 --> 50:18.500
But I did find out on the internet

50:18.500 --> 50:22.060
using some social engineering tactics

50:22.060 --> 50:23.860
that some of your spit is still in my mouth.

50:23.860 --> 50:24.700
Isn't that funny?

50:24.700 --> 50:27.500
What have you been up to?

50:27.500 --> 50:28.660
I miss you.

50:28.660 --> 50:29.500
I miss you.

50:29.500 --> 50:31.020
Doug, I miss you so much.

50:31.020 --> 50:32.500
I miss you, Doug.

50:32.500 --> 50:34.580
We haven't spoken in a year, Doug.

50:34.580 --> 50:38.060
And we haven't had sex in equally as long, Doug, or kissed.

50:38.060 --> 50:39.820
Who is this woman with you, Doug?

50:40.700 --> 50:44.660
I know that sex was kind of an afterthought, but.

50:44.660 --> 50:46.140
Whose baby is that, Doug?

50:46.140 --> 50:46.980
That's weird.

50:46.980 --> 50:47.820
That's weird.

50:47.820 --> 50:48.900
That didn't come out of me, did it?

50:48.900 --> 50:50.400
Ha, ha, ha.

50:50.400 --> 50:52.000
Oh, I'm bummed out now.

50:52.000 --> 50:55.420
Is our mouth, our mouths are just like,

50:55.420 --> 50:57.900
that thing about Caesar's last breath has me thinking

50:57.900 --> 51:00.340
like there's definitely everyone spit in my mouth

51:00.340 --> 51:01.820
at this point in the whole world.

51:01.820 --> 51:03.740
Griffin, do you want to be more disturbed?

51:03.740 --> 51:06.060
Like people die and go back to the earth

51:06.060 --> 51:08.260
and then that dirt and dust blows around in the air.

51:08.260 --> 51:09.980
So there's dead people particles in your mouth

51:09.980 --> 51:11.180
whenever you breathe in.

51:13.540 --> 51:17.100
You're eating dead people every time you eat anything.

51:17.100 --> 51:17.940
Oh, great.

51:17.940 --> 51:18.820
Cool.

51:18.820 --> 51:19.660
Cool and great.

51:19.660 --> 51:21.900
You can, people use Caesar's last breath

51:21.900 --> 51:25.780
a lot, but you could like, you could use that

51:25.780 --> 51:29.260
for any person in any situation.

51:29.260 --> 51:32.980
Like every time you breathe in, you're breathing

51:32.980 --> 51:36.500
in the air that Hitler inhaled to sing happy birthday

51:36.500 --> 51:37.940
to his nephew that one time.

51:37.940 --> 51:39.780
Oh, and then you say something really offensive

51:39.780 --> 51:42.140
and you're like, so that was Hitler's breath.

51:42.140 --> 51:44.820
That was Hitler's, that was, oh, that was a little

51:44.820 --> 51:46.200
Hitler breath molecule that came.

51:46.200 --> 51:47.360
Your breath smells like shit.

51:47.360 --> 51:48.200
It's not me.

51:48.200 --> 51:50.900
It's the Hitler breath from the nephew's birthday.

51:50.900 --> 51:53.100
You, every time you breathe, you're breathing

51:53.100 --> 51:56.800
in the air that Neil Armstrong used to tell his wife

51:56.800 --> 51:58.700
he wasn't sure he'd be able to go to the moon

51:58.700 --> 52:00.700
because he had really bad diarrhea.

52:00.700 --> 52:01.540
Yeah.

52:01.540 --> 52:03.380
Did you know that?

52:03.380 --> 52:04.420
That's science.

52:04.420 --> 52:07.100
When Lance Armstrong confessed to Oprah he was cheating

52:07.100 --> 52:10.880
that whole time he's, and now I get that.

52:10.880 --> 52:13.220
I get fucking dirty cheater breath.

52:15.020 --> 52:16.760
God damn it.

52:16.760 --> 52:19.660
You know that big note in My Heart Will Go On

52:19.660 --> 52:21.060
by Celine Dion?

52:21.060 --> 52:25.060
Oh man, we got a lot, half my breath is that note.

52:25.060 --> 52:26.780
There's so much note there.

52:28.300 --> 52:29.740
She recorded that in a submarine,

52:29.740 --> 52:31.980
so that's probably not, that air's been filtered.

52:31.980 --> 52:32.820
And then.

52:32.820 --> 52:36.080
And that was the only time she's ever performed the song.

52:36.080 --> 52:38.740
She exited underwater via airlock

52:38.740 --> 52:41.520
and then sank the submarine with a torpedo

52:41.520 --> 52:43.060
that she fired from her mouth.

52:43.060 --> 52:46.500
And she returned to her husband Prince Neymar

52:46.500 --> 52:49.060
to rule over Atlantis forever and ever.

52:49.060 --> 52:49.900
Yeah.

52:51.220 --> 52:53.980
These men think they can infest our waters.

52:54.980 --> 52:57.700
I will punish them the only way I know how,

52:57.700 --> 53:01.520
by singing a beautiful song and then sinking their submarine.

53:03.180 --> 53:04.660
I'm French.

53:04.660 --> 53:06.900
This has been our most scientific episodes.

53:06.900 --> 53:11.820
You are learning a lot this week, I think, from us.

53:11.820 --> 53:12.900
We hope you've enjoyed it

53:12.900 --> 53:16.000
and we hope that you'll come back for more.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.780
We're here most Mondays and the occasional Thursday,

53:19.780 --> 53:20.620
apparently.

53:22.140 --> 53:23.980
But we are here for you.

53:23.980 --> 53:25.860
You can write us if you have a question

53:25.860 --> 53:29.260
or you find a good Yahoo or just wanna say hi.

53:29.260 --> 53:32.540
It's M-B-M-B-A-M at Maximumfun.org.

53:32.540 --> 53:34.300
What's Maximumfun.org, you ask?

53:34.300 --> 53:35.420
Well, it's funny you should mention that.

53:35.420 --> 53:37.260
It's only the best podcast network

53:37.260 --> 53:38.820
on this great blue globe.

53:38.820 --> 53:41.180
There's so many other shows like The Goose Down,

53:41.180 --> 53:44.060
Lady to Lady, Oh No Ross and Carrie,

53:44.060 --> 53:46.380
International Waters, Judge John Hodgson.

53:46.380 --> 53:48.460
I'm always worried when we do this

53:48.460 --> 53:51.260
that if you did all the statistics,

53:51.260 --> 53:52.980
there is one podcast on Maximumfun

53:52.980 --> 53:54.280
that we've never, ever mentioned.

53:54.280 --> 53:55.180
No, we've never.

53:55.180 --> 53:57.260
This is to clear your insecurity.

53:57.260 --> 53:59.220
Steve and Jenny.

53:59.220 --> 54:01.580
Steve and Jenny, Steve and Jenny in the morning.

54:01.580 --> 54:02.420
Steve and Jenny, Steve and Jenny in the morning.

54:02.420 --> 54:03.240
Steve and Jenny, Steve and Jenny in the morning.

54:03.240 --> 54:04.080
Steve and Jenny, Steve and Jenny in the morning.

54:04.080 --> 54:04.920
Steve and Jenny, Steve and Jenny in the morning.

54:04.920 --> 54:05.740
Oh, man.

54:05.740 --> 54:06.580
But anyway, there's a lot of great shows there.

54:06.580 --> 54:08.680
There are great forums that you can go be a part of.

54:08.680 --> 54:10.620
There's a family waiting there for you to join them.

54:10.620 --> 54:12.100
You're the prodigal son

54:12.100 --> 54:14.280
and you should go rush into their bosom.

54:14.280 --> 54:16.420
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

54:16.420 --> 54:18.500
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

54:18.500 --> 54:20.860
which is on the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

54:20.860 --> 54:23.640
You can catch that bad boy on iTunes

54:23.640 --> 54:27.780
or on, now that's what I call Music 15

54:27.780 --> 54:32.060
or Suncoast Records at your local mall,

I've heard of it.

55:06.920 --> 55:08.540

You can get on a boat with Kyle Canane

55:10.820 --> 55:12.340

55:12.340 --> 55:13.740
Just the two of you.

55:13.740 --> 55:15.580
Just the two of you on a romantic ocean voyage.

55:15.580 --> 55:17.840
A private skiff with you and Kyle Canane.

You're on a boat, remember?

55:30.560 --> 55:31.500
From a while ago?

55:31.500 --> 55:32.680
Sure, from Mad TV.

55:34.220 --> 55:37.820
Yeah, great job closing out the show, you two.

55:37.820 --> 55:38.700
Just a great job in general.

55:38.700 --> 55:41.300
I think on this episode, you both really did great work.

55:41.300 --> 55:42.140
You too, Griffin.

55:42.140 --> 55:43.660
Do you have a last Yahoo for us?

55:43.660 --> 55:47.620
Sure, it was sent in by level six Yahoo shaman Drew Davenport.

55:47.620 --> 55:48.780
Thank you, Drew Davenport.

55:48.780 --> 55:49.700
Uh-oh, dang.

55:49.700 --> 55:50.700
He leveled up.

55:50.700 --> 55:52.260
He's level seven now.

55:52.260 --> 55:53.100
Good work.

The account has been suspended.

55:57.820 --> 55:58.660
Ha ha ha.

56:01.140 --> 56:05.200
Who asks, what nationality is he, man?

56:05.200 --> 56:06.040
What?

56:07.120 --> 56:08.220
I'm Justin McElroy.

56:08.220 --> 56:09.560

56:12.880 --> 56:13.720
We're out of lips.

56:13.720 --> 56:18.720
Hey good girls, do you wanna just say, hey I wanna?

56:38.240 --> 56:39.520
Hi, my name is Ruchikesh Hereway

56:39.520 --> 56:41.960
and I have a podcast called Song Exploder.

56:41.960 --> 56:44.560
In each episode, a musician takes apart one of their songs

56:44.560 --> 56:47.320
and piece by piece tells you the story of how it was made.

56:47.320 --> 56:48.880
You get an inside look into the creative

56:48.880 --> 56:51.120
and technical process and a unique view of a song

56:51.120 --> 56:52.480
by hearing just the drums.

56:54.260 --> 56:55.400
Or just the guitars.

56:56.560 --> 56:58.640
Or say, just a Wurlitzer piano.

57:01.780 --> 57:03.680
If you're a fan of music, if you make music,

57:03.680 --> 57:05.320
or if you just like to learn how things are made,

57:05.320 --> 57:07.400
come check it out on Maximumfun.org.

57:07.400 --> 57:34.400
Thanks.
