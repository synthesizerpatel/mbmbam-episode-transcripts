00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:47.040
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

00:47.040 --> 00:50.320
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:50.320 --> 00:52.640
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.640 --> 00:56.720
This is your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

00:56.720 --> 00:59.040
Did we catch you mid-yawn, Griffin?

00:59.040 --> 01:02.800
You did catch me mid-yawn. That was not a goof.

01:02.800 --> 01:08.640
Although I do want to talk about the big DST, the big elephant in the room,

01:08.640 --> 01:14.240
the fact that we're not saving daylight anymore, or we are now.

01:14.240 --> 01:20.800
We no longer are. We've done away with the shackles of that terrible, terrible policy.

01:20.800 --> 01:25.440
I looked at the daylight that we had, and I said, I'm all right.

01:25.440 --> 01:28.000
I feel like I have too much daylight, one hour's worth of it.

01:28.000 --> 01:38.320
So let's just, it's 2.03 p.m. Texas time right now, and my body feels like it's 11.30 p.m.

01:38.880 --> 01:44.320
And I know it's like not, we didn't jump that far, but it still like sucks so bad.

01:44.320 --> 01:47.360
Like all of this, this whole thing sucks so bad.

01:48.080 --> 01:53.680
And I was wondering, I had, I had an idea after my second nap today,

01:53.680 --> 01:55.840
and I was, I was hoping you all would hear me out.

01:55.840 --> 01:58.080
Maybe we could spread the word about it and maybe get something going.

01:58.720 --> 02:01.040
We've gotten lots of things going in this show.

02:02.880 --> 02:09.200
You know, we brought back camo cargo shorts back in the summer of 2013, and that was very cool.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.160
And I was hoping maybe we could do this.

02:12.160 --> 02:21.440
So I had this idea for new time, how time would do it from, from now on.

02:22.080 --> 02:24.320
This is such a big idea. I need to sit back down.

02:24.320 --> 02:25.840
Why were you standing?

02:25.840 --> 02:27.280
You're standing up? That's weird.

02:27.280 --> 02:30.240
I was standing because I was getting ready to disagree with Griffin,

02:30.240 --> 02:32.560
and then I sat back down because I just need to listen.

02:32.560 --> 02:35.840
You're doing it in like sort of the 1776 style,

02:35.840 --> 02:39.200
where you had to stand up and you know, tap your cane against it.

02:39.920 --> 02:40.800
Here's the idea.

02:40.800 --> 02:44.160
I saw an elderly man come to my table, and I was trying to be polite.

02:44.800 --> 02:45.040
Sure.

02:46.640 --> 02:48.080
You wake up in the morning.

02:48.640 --> 02:49.040
All right.

02:49.760 --> 02:51.680
Arm gives out a warning.

02:51.680 --> 02:54.400
You don't think you're going to make it on time.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.080
Parents just don't understand.

02:56.080 --> 02:56.800
Okay.

02:56.800 --> 03:00.160
You wake up in the morning and it's 9 30.

03:02.080 --> 03:04.000
So that's the first step of it.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.400
You wait, you wake up in the morning and it's just, it is 9 30.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.320
Well, I'm hooked so far, Griffin.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.600
Now reel me in.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.160
So not, cause 9 30 is like a bet, a really good one.

03:14.160 --> 03:17.120
Cause if you wake up at 9 30, it's like, whoa, I slept in so late.

03:17.120 --> 03:18.560
I feel, I feel great.

03:18.560 --> 03:23.440
I feel so energized, but also there's still a lot of the morning left and the, you know,

03:23.440 --> 03:29.280
the day's still right in front of you cause it's 9 30 and it stays 9 30 until, I mean,

03:29.280 --> 03:31.120
you probably eat a little something right then.

03:31.120 --> 03:31.680
Right.

03:31.680 --> 03:36.960
And then the next time you get hungry, that's a time that I'm just going to call lunch time.

03:36.960 --> 03:38.240
The lunch time.

03:38.240 --> 03:38.640
All right.

03:38.640 --> 03:42.960
So if I'm, I want to make sure I'm keeping up with new time.

03:43.600 --> 03:44.000
Wake up.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.160
Which I feel like a punchier title would be.

03:46.960 --> 03:47.760
McElroy time.

03:47.760 --> 03:48.880
Griffin time.

03:48.880 --> 03:49.680
Griffin time.

03:49.680 --> 03:50.800
Stop, stop.

03:50.800 --> 03:51.440
Griffin time.

03:52.160 --> 03:52.880
Okay.

03:52.880 --> 03:57.280
I love how quickly you cut us out of that in case this is a landmark sort of moment.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.400
So you wake up.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.520
It's to protect you two.

03:59.520 --> 04:02.400
Cause it could also be, it could also blow up right in my face.

04:02.400 --> 04:05.120
So you wake up and it's 9 30.

04:05.120 --> 04:09.280
Is it 9 30 because that's when you woke up or does everybody-

04:09.280 --> 04:11.200
That's what wake up time is, you know?

04:11.200 --> 04:12.560
That's just what wake up time is.

04:12.560 --> 04:13.200
9 30.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.560
Oh, what a good, holy shit.

04:14.560 --> 04:17.920
I haven't slept until 9 30 in a long time, but I still have a lot of my day left over.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.200
I'll have a bowl of cereal.

04:19.200 --> 04:23.760
To nail it down, whatever time you, when you wake up, it is 9 30.

04:23.760 --> 04:25.920
It is not 9 30 and you wake up.

04:25.920 --> 04:28.560
You wake up, that is automatically 9 30.

04:28.560 --> 04:28.960
Yes.

04:28.960 --> 04:30.080
I'm so glad you're with me.

04:30.080 --> 04:33.600
And then you're hungry again after the breakfast and now it's just lunch time.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.360
And we don't need to give that a number.

04:35.360 --> 04:40.960
And then as soon as you finish the last bite, the last scrumptious morsel of whatever it is

04:40.960 --> 04:44.800
you're having during this midday meal, it's not lunchtime anymore.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.640
And it's immediately 4 20.

04:46.640 --> 04:48.000
And it doesn't, you don't have to be-

04:48.880 --> 04:49.280
Okay.

04:49.280 --> 04:52.320
I'm not encouraging drug use at this time.

04:52.320 --> 04:53.680
It's just, that's, it would be fun-

04:53.680 --> 04:55.360
That's the next biggest milestone.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.720
It's, well, it's just funny.

04:57.360 --> 04:57.840
Yeah.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.280
It's just very funny.

04:59.280 --> 05:01.440
So wake up, 9 30 breakfast.

05:01.440 --> 05:02.480
I'm hungry again.

05:02.480 --> 05:04.160
Now it's lunchtime.

05:04.160 --> 05:05.360
Oh, I can't talk on the phone right now.

05:05.360 --> 05:05.920
It's lunchtime.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.440
I'll call you back at 4 20.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.840
And you fit home, sandwich gone.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.480
Okay, now it's 4 20 and it's going to stay.

05:12.480 --> 05:16.160
It's going to stay 4 20 until it just gets dark.

05:16.800 --> 05:21.360
And then when it's dark, it's seven o'clock because it's seven o'clock.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.040
That's a decent lunch hour.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.120
Also, depending on what time zone you live.

05:25.120 --> 05:27.920
And by the way, time zones are not, they don't exist anymore.

05:29.120 --> 05:33.280
But the TV, the televisions about the, you know, the good shows are about to start

05:34.160 --> 05:39.440
because it's seven o'clock and seven o'clock, you know, you eat whenever you feel like it.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.680
And then when you get sleepy, it's 2 a.m.

05:42.320 --> 05:44.720
And it's like, oh, yeah, I'm partying.

05:44.720 --> 05:45.520
Now it's 2 a.m.

05:45.520 --> 05:48.400
Well, no, you party during seven when it's 2 a.m.

05:48.400 --> 05:52.320
It's like, okay, I should really crash because it's, you know, I've got a long day ahead of me.

05:52.320 --> 05:54.000
Oh, this is great because 2 a.m.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
It's not, I think I should go to bed.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.920
It's why haven't I gone to bed yet?

05:57.920 --> 06:00.080
The responsible thing is to go to bed now.

06:00.080 --> 06:03.440
2 a.m. is you feel good about how much you've partied tonight.

06:03.440 --> 06:06.560
And also, you know, like, oh, I'm going to get that good sleep.

06:06.560 --> 06:11.120
And you know that you're going to get seven and a half hours of sleep.

06:11.120 --> 06:11.920
Yeah.

06:11.920 --> 06:14.400
Because you're going to wake up at 9.30 the next morning.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
I'm trying to envision the clock in my head.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.040
At the top of the clock, it says 9.30.

06:22.400 --> 06:22.800
Okay.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.680
And then if you go down the clock some.

06:25.680 --> 06:26.320
Yeah.

06:26.320 --> 06:30.400
And you also, just to be clear, have to manually turn this dial on the clock

06:30.400 --> 06:32.960
because you wake up at 9.30, eat breakfast,

06:32.960 --> 06:35.760
and then you reach up and you turn the clock to lunchtime.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.760
It's more of a progress chart for yourself.

06:37.760 --> 06:41.040
And it's not going to stay on lunchtime very long.

06:41.040 --> 06:46.320
It's just how long it takes you to eat the sandwich or bagel or soup or, you know, whatever.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.600
And now it's 4.20.

06:47.600 --> 06:51.280
And you're going to show your watch to all your friends and be like, get it.

06:51.280 --> 06:54.720
And you'll be able to do that for, I mean, until the sun goes down.

06:54.720 --> 06:56.640
Griffin, I don't think that this is your intention,

06:56.640 --> 07:01.360
but it does kind of sound like most of the day is taken up by 4.20.

07:01.360 --> 07:04.160
Hmm.

07:04.160 --> 07:07.120
Because it kind of sounds like you wake up, you eat breakfast,

07:07.120 --> 07:09.040
and then when you finish breakfast, you eat lunch.

07:09.040 --> 07:10.000
Then when you finish lunch-

07:10.000 --> 07:13.200
You don't eat lunch immediately after breakfast, you dummy.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.840
Then what's between 9.30 and lunch?

07:15.840 --> 07:18.240
You just do stuff while it's 9.30.

07:18.240 --> 07:20.400
Yeah, you just do stuff until you get hungry again.

07:20.400 --> 07:21.680
And it's 9.30 the whole time.

07:21.680 --> 07:26.720
But when you finish the last bite of your lunch, it is then 4.20 till it's dark.

07:26.720 --> 07:27.520
Is this correct?

07:28.240 --> 07:28.560
Yeah.

07:28.560 --> 07:32.720
Wait, so dark, at dark, when it gets dark, it's 7 o'clock.

07:32.720 --> 07:38.080
I can't believe how many, it's fucking like four or five, I lost count, times.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.680
And I can't believe you're having this much trouble.

07:39.680 --> 07:41.360
I just want to know when it's 7 o'clock.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.800
And then the sun goes down.

07:43.440 --> 07:47.840
And in the newspaper, every day, it's going to say sunrise is at 9.30,

07:47.840 --> 07:49.200
and you're going to miss it.

07:49.200 --> 07:52.160
And sunset is 7 all the time.

07:52.160 --> 07:53.200
It's always 7.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.640
And then you're going to watch Survivor.

07:54.640 --> 07:59.120
I liked that it's 7, because it gives you an hour until the good shows are on.

07:59.120 --> 08:00.080
Well, or unless you live-

08:00.080 --> 08:01.360
I guess for you, they come on at 7.

08:01.360 --> 08:04.000
Do they come on at 7 for you?

08:04.000 --> 08:07.040
Yeah, so it's always like, the sun's down, turn on the TV, Survivor's on.

08:07.040 --> 08:11.120
And it's what I love about all the times I've picked, because they're all brilliant,

08:11.120 --> 08:14.480
is that each one, when you look at the clock and it's 9.30 a.m., you think,

08:14.480 --> 08:16.000
I've got a lot of day left ahead of me.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
When you eat lunch, you're like, not thinking about time, because you're just really deep,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
deep, deep, deep in this sandwich or soup.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.600
And by the way, in this new time, those are the only two acceptable lunch foods.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.120
And that's another thing we're going to get.

08:27.120 --> 08:31.120
4.20 is still a lot of the day left ahead of you,

08:31.120 --> 08:34.080
and 7 o'clock, a whole lot of the night left ahead of you, until 2 a.m.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.600
And it's like, oh, it's dead.

08:35.600 --> 08:36.160
It's done.

08:36.160 --> 08:37.200
I have to go to sleep right now.

08:37.200 --> 08:42.640
Now, along with dietary changes, Griffin, I do also anticipate that this new schedule

08:42.640 --> 08:46.640
will require employment changes, because it sounds like everyone is going to have to work

08:46.640 --> 08:47.200
from home.

08:48.080 --> 08:50.160
Well, you'll work when it's 4.20.

08:50.160 --> 08:51.600
You'll work when it's 4.20.

08:52.640 --> 08:55.920
That's not how I understood that to work.

08:55.920 --> 08:59.360
But then, just until you feel it.

08:59.360 --> 09:03.040
I feel like this is outside of time.

09:03.040 --> 09:03.440
I feel like you're-

09:03.440 --> 09:07.040
When are the people supposed to clean Disneyland?

09:07.040 --> 09:08.000
Because it seems like-

09:08.000 --> 09:08.480
2 a.m.

09:09.360 --> 09:12.640
Okay, so they go in at 2 a.m. when they should be asleep.

09:12.640 --> 09:14.640
So they just don't get to sleep anymore.

09:14.640 --> 09:15.280
Is that right?

09:15.920 --> 09:17.120
Probably not.

09:17.120 --> 09:17.840
Probably not.

09:17.840 --> 09:18.080
Oh, man, that's rough.

09:18.080 --> 09:21.920
I mean, there's lots of- but for everybody else, you can get a good amount of sleep in

09:21.920 --> 09:22.880
there, except for the people-

09:22.880 --> 09:24.240
They could sleep 4.20.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.880
It sounds like 4.20 is kind of free, free period.

09:26.880 --> 09:28.320
Kind of a free period, yeah.

09:28.320 --> 09:30.320
4.20 is just sort of a free skate.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.520
Go out and do whatever you want.

09:31.520 --> 09:34.560
But at 7 o'clock, you better watch Survivor and get your vittles.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.920
Because then you have to go to Disneyland and clean it.

09:38.880 --> 09:41.600
There's no more seasonal affective disorder.

09:42.640 --> 09:44.080
There's no more wars.

09:44.080 --> 09:47.040
Okay, because no one knows what time to show up for the war.

09:47.040 --> 09:52.400
Yeah, it's like, I'm going to show up on the big theater of war front at 4.20, and then

09:52.400 --> 09:56.640
it's sort of a staggered arrival, and it's like, well, this isn't- let's just go home.

09:56.640 --> 09:58.800
Yeah, what if there was a war and nobody came?

09:58.800 --> 09:59.520
You know what I mean?

09:59.520 --> 10:00.560
Because it was 4.20.

10:00.560 --> 10:01.600
Because it was 4.20.

10:02.960 --> 10:07.200
Sounds like you guys love it, and sounds like America's gonna really love this one.

10:07.200 --> 10:12.720
And also, I've got all of these watches with four times on it, and they're priced to move.

10:12.720 --> 10:18.480
Coming soon to topotico.com, it's these watches.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.160
Coming soon to Movement Watches.

10:20.160 --> 10:27.040
It's just sort of a big- it's four sort of sections, and they're very, very helpful.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.920
Before we move on to questions, can I tell you guys something real quick?

10:29.920 --> 10:32.320
A true Travis McElroy Daylight Savings Time fact.

10:33.440 --> 10:37.680
I did not know that Daylight Savings Time had any kind of effect last night.

10:37.680 --> 10:42.800
I wasn't aware, missed it, didn't catch the buzz, didn't know it was happening.

10:42.800 --> 10:46.160
And I realized this morning, I only found out about it because I saw someone talking

10:46.160 --> 10:47.360
about it on Twitter.

10:47.360 --> 10:51.840
Because in my house, I only have like two or three analog clocks now.

10:52.480 --> 10:59.040
Like, most of my times are like on my phone, or my computers, or on my game systems, that

10:59.040 --> 10:59.840
kind of thing.

10:59.840 --> 11:04.640
And I thought about like, there's a very real chance that there's somebody that doesn't

11:04.640 --> 11:11.520
own any analog watches or clocks that Daylight Savings Time could come and go and change,

11:11.520 --> 11:13.360
and they would never know it.

11:13.360 --> 11:18.640
Yeah, it's almost like it's a stupid, stupid, stupid idea that sucks and there's no point

11:18.640 --> 11:19.040
to it.

11:19.040 --> 11:23.920
And those people are living maybe the most blissful, most wonderful, except that it gets

11:23.920 --> 11:27.520
dark at like 3.30 p.m. and you're like, huh, strange.

11:27.520 --> 11:31.600
You're sleepy all day, and there's no reason for you to be sleepy.

11:31.600 --> 11:36.960
I got an extra hour of sleep, but my body's default state when threatened is like, oh,

11:36.960 --> 11:37.680
I want a nap.

11:38.800 --> 11:43.920
Did you all know that they keep changing the day that Daylight Savings Time ends on?

11:44.880 --> 11:49.440
Like, in 2005, they pushed it back so it would be after Halloween.

11:50.400 --> 11:50.800
What do we-

11:50.800 --> 11:51.600
Because of Candy Lobby.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.120
Because of Candy Lobby.

11:53.120 --> 12:00.480
Yes, and it's like, if it's that pliable, fucking, then do my Griffin Time.

12:00.480 --> 12:07.600
Like, if we're just having fun with it, with time, and how it works in the sun and God,

12:08.160 --> 12:09.360
then what are we doing?

12:10.080 --> 12:16.720
Someday, when I'm in charge, I'm gonna keep moving spring forward ahead and move fall

12:16.720 --> 12:22.320
back back until eventually it's like, you gotta turn your clocks forward an hour on

12:22.320 --> 12:25.760
Sunday and then turn them back an hour on Monday.

12:25.760 --> 12:27.040
It's still not worth it.

12:27.040 --> 12:32.000
It's just like, in those two days, everybody's either late or early for everything.

12:33.920 --> 12:34.960
Do you know how-

12:34.960 --> 12:36.400
This is not a joke.

12:36.400 --> 12:37.600
I learned this yesterday.

12:37.600 --> 12:42.800
Do you know how Amtrak deals with Daylight Savings Time?

12:43.440 --> 12:46.080
When it's fall back so you get an extra hour?

12:46.080 --> 12:47.440
Do you know what Amtrak does?

12:47.440 --> 12:50.240
Fucking pulls over for an hour and kicks it.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.120
That's what Amtrak does to stay on schedule.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.200
They're like, well, we got an extra hour.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.240
Let's kick it.

12:56.240 --> 13:00.080
And wherever they stop next, they just kick it for an hour.

13:00.080 --> 13:00.400
All right.

13:00.400 --> 13:01.120
It's the worst.

13:01.120 --> 13:04.160
We're literally, we've been Andy Rooney for like 13 minutes.

13:04.160 --> 13:04.800
Let's shake it.

13:04.800 --> 13:05.520
Let's shake it off.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.680
The government's pretty fucked up right now.

13:07.680 --> 13:10.160
Maybe they could just like get together for this.

13:10.160 --> 13:15.680
Can we just like build some bridges, get rid of Daylight Savings Time, get rid of the penny,

13:15.680 --> 13:20.320
and let's just do a little house cleaning since we can't agree on anything major.

13:20.320 --> 13:23.680
Let's like get rid of the penny and Daylight Savings Time.

13:23.680 --> 13:27.280
Everybody hates it.

13:27.280 --> 13:28.960
How about some questions?

13:28.960 --> 13:29.920
Yeah, a question.

13:29.920 --> 13:33.760
I just moved to a new neighborhood and I passed an elementary school on my way to work.

13:33.760 --> 13:37.600
This means I must cross at least one residential intersection that has a crossing guard.

13:38.320 --> 13:40.720
What is a child?

13:40.720 --> 13:42.800
Yeah, can I talk about Andy Rooney for a second?

13:42.800 --> 13:43.680
You just brought him up.

13:46.080 --> 13:49.600
He was just an old man blathering on about the stuff that bothered him.

13:49.600 --> 13:53.520
I just realized that like there were only, he was on the air for like 100 years,

13:53.520 --> 13:56.320
and there were only two possible reactions to Andy Rooney.

13:57.120 --> 14:01.280
Regular people looking at him being like, what is this old man going on about?

14:01.280 --> 14:04.000
And old people who are like, that's what I'm fucking talking about.

14:04.000 --> 14:04.480
Yeah.

14:04.480 --> 14:09.120
Like, that seems like a challenging gig to me.

14:09.120 --> 14:14.320
I think if he was born 20 years later, he would have the most successful podcast in America.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.280
Oh, that's true.

14:15.280 --> 14:18.640
Yeah, but the problem is that Andy Rooney only asks the questions.

14:18.640 --> 14:21.120
And he never offered the answers.

14:21.120 --> 14:25.760
And I think it's time that I step up and I just go point by point,

14:25.760 --> 14:29.360
everything Andy Rooney brought up, and I solve it.

14:29.360 --> 14:30.640
Now that's a podcast.

14:30.640 --> 14:31.840
Andy Tooney.

14:31.840 --> 14:32.960
Randy Ooney.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.960
He was kind of the first podcaster.

14:34.960 --> 14:37.360
He was very angry and talking to no one.

14:38.320 --> 14:39.280
That's basically it.

14:39.840 --> 14:44.560
He would have had a show just called What the Heck with Andy Rooney,

14:44.560 --> 14:46.240
and then Marin would be out of a job.

14:46.240 --> 14:50.800
I just moved to a new neighborhood, and I pass an elementary school on my way to work.

14:50.800 --> 14:54.720
This means I must cross at least one residential intersection that has a crossing guard.

14:55.600 --> 14:58.560
What is a childless pedestrian to do?

14:58.560 --> 15:01.600
Am I offending her if I cross on my own?

15:01.600 --> 15:04.720
Because sometimes she's helping a child cross the opposite way,

15:04.720 --> 15:07.600
and I feel confident in my own abilities to navigate the intersection.

15:07.600 --> 15:08.400
Oh, woof.

15:08.400 --> 15:09.200
This is tough.

15:09.200 --> 15:09.760
This is great.

15:09.760 --> 15:11.520
Or do I wait to help me cross?

15:11.520 --> 15:13.680
And if she does start to pull up her sign,

15:13.680 --> 15:18.800
do I have to wait for her to get halfway out before I cross?

15:19.920 --> 15:20.800
Is it rude?

15:20.800 --> 15:22.320
Okay, so et cetera, et cetera.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.000
You got the question.

15:24.000 --> 15:24.400
You get it.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.480
That's from Home Guard in Toronto.

15:26.480 --> 15:29.680
The rub here, I'm not worried about the crossing guard's feelings

15:29.680 --> 15:32.720
because the crossing guard doesn't need to help me out.

15:32.720 --> 15:37.120
I'm 30, and I've never been struck by even one vehicle a little bit.

15:37.120 --> 15:39.280
I'm batting a thousand vis-a-vis being struck.

15:39.280 --> 15:44.160
But if a kid is on the other side or on the side of the street that I'm on,

15:44.160 --> 15:48.080
and I say, fuck this, and I just walk across

15:48.080 --> 15:50.400
because I don't see a vehicle coming and the light's green,

15:52.960 --> 15:56.000
I feel like I'm maybe being a bad role model.

15:56.000 --> 15:56.960
And I get that.

15:57.920 --> 16:00.080
But it is pretty punk rock.

16:00.080 --> 16:01.360
It just is the other kid.

16:01.360 --> 16:02.480
They'll stop.

16:02.480 --> 16:03.360
Trust me.

16:03.360 --> 16:03.840
Trust me.

16:03.840 --> 16:04.320
They'll stop.

16:04.320 --> 16:05.840
Pedestrians have the right of way.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.840
See, I am worried about the crossing guard

16:07.840 --> 16:10.240
because I'm worried it would be like a rock-a-doodle

16:10.240 --> 16:11.920
Sean DeClair kind of thing.

16:11.920 --> 16:12.720
Go on.

16:12.720 --> 16:16.720
Where the crossing guard would see me cross without her help.

16:17.760 --> 16:18.960
I just said crossing path.

16:18.960 --> 16:25.120
Yeah, everything that she understood about how they can't cross without me.

16:25.120 --> 16:26.960
But then she would see me cross without her,

16:26.960 --> 16:29.520
and she would think, what have I been doing this whole time?

16:29.520 --> 16:31.200
Maybe they didn't need me to cross.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.160
And then I would have to go on an adventure with an animated kitten boy

16:36.160 --> 16:37.920
to fight off some owls or some shit.

16:37.920 --> 16:39.600
All right, let me give you this.

16:40.560 --> 16:46.000
One day you just have the crossing guard hold all the kids back for like a half hour.

16:47.120 --> 16:48.080
No crossing.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.720
Build up a, I'm talking about a mess of kids.

16:50.720 --> 16:51.920
A big old pile.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.440
A whole gaggle of kids.

16:53.440 --> 16:57.280
Just a gaggle of these little, a conflagration of kiddos.

16:57.280 --> 17:01.840
And they chill there for like a half hour like, what the fuck is going on?

17:02.400 --> 17:05.760
And then you show up in the gaggle and you say like,

17:05.760 --> 17:07.120
this is ridiculous.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.720
You don't know what you're talking about, you big goober.

17:10.720 --> 17:15.280
And all you want to do is control me and my body.

17:15.280 --> 17:17.120
And I say, screw that.

17:17.840 --> 17:18.800
Freedom.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.560
And then you start to cross.

17:20.560 --> 17:23.680
And then you do get hit by a car while you're going across.

17:23.680 --> 17:28.320
And it's something that you, but you planned it.

17:28.320 --> 17:30.960
It's like your friend.

17:30.960 --> 17:32.400
And his soft car.

17:32.400 --> 17:33.760
His super soft car.

17:33.760 --> 17:36.080
It's Randy's soft Honda.

17:36.080 --> 17:39.120
And he comes and he hits you a little bit.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.480
I mean, he hits you.

17:40.480 --> 17:42.160
He hits you, but it's soft?

17:42.160 --> 17:44.160
It's like a pillow fight, you know?

17:44.160 --> 17:48.960
It's gotta be, it's gotta look bad.

17:48.960 --> 17:50.800
You will go to the hospital.

17:50.800 --> 17:54.160
Like, but you'll be fine eventually.

17:54.160 --> 17:58.080
Maybe there's a big crane up in the sky so high up that they don't see it.

17:58.800 --> 18:02.640
And then you get hit by the car and then your body just gets pulled up

18:02.640 --> 18:05.360
by the crane really fast into the clouds.

18:05.360 --> 18:10.400
And so it's like you got hit by the car and launched 400 feet upwards.

18:10.960 --> 18:13.600
And then you hang there with wings and a halo.

18:13.600 --> 18:16.480
And you say to the kids, I should have listened.

18:16.480 --> 18:17.280
And you sit back down.

18:17.280 --> 18:18.880
You're like, oh, no.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.640
Well, at least heaven's real.

18:20.640 --> 18:21.140
Bye.

18:21.840 --> 18:26.720
If only I'd paid attention to the crossing guard, as you all should from now on.

18:26.720 --> 18:28.720
Now I'm off to hang out with Jesus.

18:28.720 --> 18:32.640
And then in the future, you can still cross.

18:33.360 --> 18:35.120
And it's not that big a deal.

18:35.120 --> 18:37.200
But now two things are going to happen.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.360
One, the kids are still going to see you and be like, oh, I don't know.

18:39.360 --> 18:42.160
I did watch that person get hit so hard they turned into angel.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.840
And the other thing is you're going to look even cooler because of that.

18:47.840 --> 18:49.360
Like, oh, shit.

18:49.360 --> 18:52.000
Wait, you're that person that got hit by the car and you're still doing it?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.600
I love your devil may care attitude.

18:53.600 --> 18:57.120
I'm not going to follow you because I did watch you get hit so hard that you went to heaven.

18:57.120 --> 18:59.360
Justin There's another option.

19:00.960 --> 19:03.360
And that is that you dress like a crossing guard.

19:04.080 --> 19:08.160
So basically what I'm suggesting is you dress like a crossing guard.

19:08.160 --> 19:10.800
And then as you pass, you're like, officer?

19:10.800 --> 19:13.120
And then they like tip their hat to you.

19:13.120 --> 19:15.600
And the kids are like, well, of course.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.040
He's a crossing guard.

19:17.040 --> 19:18.880
He knows what he's doing.

19:18.880 --> 19:20.400
The faith in the-

19:20.400 --> 19:22.480
Travis He's had special training and such.

19:22.480 --> 19:25.040
Justin Yeah, the faith in the institution remains.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.640
Travis Because here's the thing.

19:26.640 --> 19:30.960
If you don't take the initiative and just cross yourself, the other side of this is like,

19:30.960 --> 19:36.320
so you want to go, you know, east-west, but that crossing guard is crossing kids north-south.

19:36.320 --> 19:39.040
You're going to stand on the corner, wait for her to get back, and then,

19:40.080 --> 19:40.800
after you.

19:40.800 --> 19:44.160
And then like, are you waiting for the crossing guard so you can get it?

19:44.160 --> 19:45.280
Because you're just so-

19:45.280 --> 19:48.000
I'm like, and then she goes out and you're like, thank you.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.120
And then you cross the street.

19:49.120 --> 19:49.840
Like, I don't-

19:49.840 --> 19:53.440
Justin It's- this situation is so bad that my anxiety

19:53.440 --> 19:58.880
would be so legitimately piqued on a daily basis at, you know, I'm walking to work,

19:58.880 --> 20:06.160
so it's going to be 930, that I would literally, the block before, pop open a manhole cover

20:06.160 --> 20:08.160
and take the sewer for a couple blocks.

20:08.160 --> 20:10.320
Travis A sewer would be a great option.

20:11.680 --> 20:21.120
One other one would be to wear, like, a black cape and a mask and a t-shirt that says, like,

20:21.680 --> 20:22.800
Mr. Fart on it.

20:22.800 --> 20:28.800
So the kids, like, see Mr. Fart sneak across when he's not supposed to, but they all are

20:28.800 --> 20:32.160
like, they know that's Mr. Fart.

20:32.160 --> 20:33.440
You don't want to be like him.

20:33.440 --> 20:36.400
Justin Oh, your character's name, Jay Walker.

20:36.400 --> 20:39.840
Travis I kind of was super crazy about Mr. Fart.

20:39.840 --> 20:42.800
Justin No, Mr. Fart- okay, Mr. Fart is my father.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.320
Please call me Jay Walker.

20:44.320 --> 20:46.800
Travis And what I love about Mr. Fart is you could

20:46.800 --> 20:52.560
do that and do the get hit by a car driven by your friend, Randy, and the soft Honda.

20:52.560 --> 20:54.560
And it's both good.

20:54.560 --> 20:57.280
Justin I'm not sure I like the comeuppance because

20:57.280 --> 21:03.440
I do want kids to learn that Mr. Farts of the world can sometimes get ahead, but it's

21:03.440 --> 21:04.240
not going to pay off.

21:04.240 --> 21:09.200
Okay, if you want to play a long game, you can definitely have, like, a month of Mr.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.760
Fart crossings punctuated by a car.

21:11.760 --> 21:13.520
Travis That's my favorite Nintendo game, by the way.

21:13.520 --> 21:15.200
Mr. Fart Crossing is the best.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.920
Justin You could have, like, a month of Mr. Fart

21:17.920 --> 21:24.320
crossings punctuated by Mr. Fart getting hit by a car, and then all the kids are like,

21:25.040 --> 21:26.560
fucking finally.

21:26.560 --> 21:28.960
Finally, this guy gets his just deserts.

21:28.960 --> 21:31.520
Travis Or maybe you pull one of my favorite tropes

21:31.520 --> 21:36.160
which is, like, the crossing guard and Mr. Fart, clearly there's animosity there, clearly

21:36.160 --> 21:36.960
there's tension.

21:37.520 --> 21:42.320
But just like in that one episode of Reboot when the main bad guy, like, played a cool

21:42.320 --> 21:43.200
guitar solo-

21:43.200 --> 21:43.920
Justin Megabyte?

21:43.920 --> 21:47.360
Travis Yeah, with the, you know, the cool-

21:47.360 --> 21:48.640
Justin I know, yeah, I know what you're talking

21:48.640 --> 21:50.320
about, for his birthday.

21:50.320 --> 21:51.840
Travis Right, for Enzo's birthday.

21:51.840 --> 21:52.880
But I can't remember, Bob?

21:52.880 --> 21:53.680
That was it.

21:53.680 --> 21:57.680
Like that, where there's, like, a cool moment where the crossing guard and Mr. Fart work

21:57.680 --> 22:02.480
together to maybe stop- I really want to introduce Jay Walker to this.

22:02.480 --> 22:06.560
Maybe they want together to stop Jay Walker, the greater evil.

22:07.440 --> 22:08.800
Justin How about a Yahoo?

22:08.800 --> 22:09.840
Travis Yeah, please.

22:09.840 --> 22:12.400
Travis I feel like you guys aren't as on board with

22:12.400 --> 22:13.600
Jay Walker as I am.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.920
Justin It's just Mr. Fart is so much better.

22:15.920 --> 22:16.560
Like, Jay Walker is-

22:16.560 --> 22:18.800
Travis But Mr. Fart just crosses whenever.

22:18.800 --> 22:22.000
Jay Walker crosses wherever, you see?

22:22.000 --> 22:25.760
So Mr. Fart at least adheres to where the crossing areas are.

22:25.760 --> 22:28.240
Justin Can we get both of them, and both of them

22:28.240 --> 22:30.160
struck by the same soft Honda?

22:30.160 --> 22:30.800
Because then the kids-

22:30.800 --> 22:32.800
Travis Yeah, oh, and Jay Walker dies and Mr. Fart

22:32.800 --> 22:36.240
lives, and that's where he learns, like, I don't want to be like Jay Walker.

22:36.240 --> 22:39.520
Justin Right, and maybe Mr. Fart comes down with

22:39.520 --> 22:42.880
the halo and angel wings and goes to heaven, but Jay Walker is in hell.

22:42.880 --> 22:43.520
Travis Oh yeah.

22:43.520 --> 22:47.600
I want to go back to medical school and become Dr. Fart.

22:48.800 --> 22:51.280
Justin Here's one sent in by Hannah Troxel.

22:51.280 --> 22:52.240
Thank you, Hannah.

22:52.240 --> 22:55.760
Yahoo Answers user Henny asks,

22:57.840 --> 23:00.800
Can I play video games in my mind?

23:01.760 --> 23:03.920
Can I play video games in my mind?

23:03.920 --> 23:07.520
I do not have the money to invest in building a gaming PC.

23:07.520 --> 23:10.400
So can I play video games in my imagination?

23:10.400 --> 23:15.120
Justin I love this a lot, because I love the idea

23:15.120 --> 23:23.280
of just being, you know, at the DMV or at church or in line at Yogurt Land, the only

23:23.280 --> 23:24.720
three places I ever go.

23:25.360 --> 23:31.440
And you're just standing there and somebody's talking to you, like the preacher, but you're

23:31.440 --> 23:34.880
not paying attention because your eyes are just glassed over because you're just playing

23:34.880 --> 23:42.240
and with your best friend Master Chief in your mind, in your, you know, your mind castle.

23:42.240 --> 23:43.760
Travis In your mind den.

23:43.760 --> 23:47.040
Justin In your mind den, you're playing with Mario

23:47.040 --> 23:50.240
and Yoshi and you can do anything in there.

23:50.240 --> 23:54.080
And so maybe you're standing there and the preacher's like, are you even listening

23:54.080 --> 23:56.720
to my, we're doing Ratshack, Meshack, Abednego.

23:56.720 --> 23:57.440
It's like my favorite one.

23:57.440 --> 23:58.480
You're not even paying attention.

23:58.480 --> 24:01.680
And you're just like, I just got all the stars.

24:02.720 --> 24:04.560
I just got 30 points.

24:04.560 --> 24:06.720
You don't even know about that.

24:06.720 --> 24:09.920
Travis Oh, shoot, I lost.

24:09.920 --> 24:11.760
Because sometimes you do still need to lose.

24:11.760 --> 24:13.600
Justin You want to amp up the difficulty a little

24:13.600 --> 24:13.600
bit.

24:13.600 --> 24:14.080
Travis Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:14.080 --> 24:15.120
Justin You don't want to make it too easy on

24:15.120 --> 24:15.520
yourself.

24:15.520 --> 24:17.440
Travis Oh, no, they got me, you know.

24:17.440 --> 24:18.640
Justin Did you hear, Preacher Man?

24:18.640 --> 24:20.720
The new Shenmue game is out.

24:20.720 --> 24:23.840
Shenmue 3 is here and I'm playing it now.

24:23.840 --> 24:26.480
Travis And in my imagination, it's very good,

24:26.480 --> 24:30.080
which is maybe not how it's going to manifest in the physical space.

24:30.720 --> 24:33.760
Oh, it's so, oh, how about a game of Lucky Hit?

24:33.760 --> 24:34.800
Did you just say something?

24:35.440 --> 24:37.680
No, it's in my mind.

24:37.680 --> 24:38.720
Justin Good news.

24:38.720 --> 24:43.520
Character is back for No One Lives Forever 3 right now on the Rixbox.

24:43.520 --> 24:44.560
That's right.

24:44.560 --> 24:49.040
The Rixbox, the only gaming console in my Rix head.

24:49.040 --> 24:52.080
Travis I'm so excited for the Rixbox 360, which

24:52.080 --> 24:54.320
is when I'm going to get a third lobe.

24:54.320 --> 24:57.440
Justin It's got rumble.

24:57.440 --> 25:00.320
Travis This lobe's got rumble in it.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.240
Justin It's got motion sensitivity.

25:02.240 --> 25:05.040
If I move my head quickly enough, I'll make that jump.

25:05.040 --> 25:08.640
Travis Now there's two Master Chiefs and they're kissing.

25:08.640 --> 25:11.520
It's a mod I did in my Rixbox.

25:11.520 --> 25:14.800
Justin Oh, look at that.

25:14.800 --> 25:18.000
I found all the cheat codes in my brain.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.840
Travis There's just times where you can't.

25:20.400 --> 25:22.080
There's just times where you can't game out.

25:22.080 --> 25:24.320
And everybody wishes they were playing video games all the time.

25:24.960 --> 25:28.080
But sometimes you can't because you're in the Yogurtland line or the church line.

25:28.080 --> 25:31.600
Justin How far would you need to take the simulation?

25:31.600 --> 25:36.640
Are you going to have times when you're on the bus and you want to play Rixbox but you

25:36.640 --> 25:40.640
can't because you're downloading Bloodborne 2 to your Rixbox?

25:40.640 --> 25:42.400
Travis Yeah, it's got to update.

25:42.400 --> 25:48.480
I know the batteries on the controller are dead and I didn't go get more from the Rix Greens.

25:48.480 --> 25:53.600
Travis I think you downloading Bloodborne 2 is just

25:53.600 --> 25:57.920
you sitting in a bus saying like, alright, so this time around, more guns.

25:57.920 --> 26:01.680
Justin That's how you program it.

26:01.680 --> 26:06.000
You just have to say out loud, alright, here's all the monsters that are in it.

26:06.560 --> 26:07.520
Here we go.

26:07.520 --> 26:09.440
There's a man who looks like a crow.

26:09.440 --> 26:13.280
Travis I do like that because it gives crossover

26:13.280 --> 26:14.960
like a whole new world of possibilities.

26:14.960 --> 26:18.960
We're like, it's Bloodborne, but also my friend Todd is there.

26:18.960 --> 26:21.600
Like you can just crossover everything.

26:21.600 --> 26:25.600
Travis My favorite thing about the Rixbox 360 is

26:25.600 --> 26:27.280
that I'm in all the video games.

26:27.280 --> 26:30.160
It's real targeted marketing.

26:32.880 --> 26:35.440
Oh man, the Rixbox.

26:35.440 --> 26:36.560
Here's another question.

26:36.560 --> 26:40.560
I have a coworker who's been telling the office an incredible lie for the last two months.

26:40.560 --> 26:45.120
She claims she bought a house, she's shown us pictures, hired people to do repairs,

26:45.120 --> 26:48.720
and even left early a couple of times during packing and moving.

26:48.720 --> 26:53.440
The thing is, after some suspicious details to her story, I had a realtor friend of mine

26:53.440 --> 26:54.720
look into this house.

26:54.720 --> 26:57.680
Not only is it still for sale, but it's had no offers on it,

26:57.680 --> 27:01.200
and it's now being rented out to two totally different people.

27:01.200 --> 27:03.760
What is the best way to go about letting her know that I know?

27:03.760 --> 27:05.760
And that's from Are You For Real at Rockford.

27:05.760 --> 27:09.520
Travis What is more buckwild in this situation?

27:09.520 --> 27:11.440
Travis This is what I'm weighing right now.

27:11.440 --> 27:13.760
Travis Okay, what is more buckwild in this situation?

27:13.760 --> 27:21.280
This lie, this wild lie, or the fact that you fucking Shelby wooed it.

27:21.280 --> 27:24.320
So I do not know that I have that.

27:24.320 --> 27:28.640
I don't think I have that game in my Rick's box to think like,

27:28.640 --> 27:30.720
you know what, I'm going to talk to a fucking realtor friend of mine

27:30.720 --> 27:32.000
and get to the bottom of this.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.280
This must have been troubling you so much.

27:35.280 --> 27:36.000
Justin Yeah.

27:36.000 --> 27:42.000
Monsieur Perrault, I have a most fascinating case I think you'll like to be very intrigued by.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.920
Travis Well, I have a showing today,

27:43.920 --> 27:47.040
and I was going to make cookies, but yeah, I'll take time out of it.

27:47.040 --> 27:50.720
Is there no realtor realty confidentiality thing?

27:50.720 --> 27:53.840
I'm like, I can't just go look up to see if someone owns a house.

27:53.840 --> 27:57.200
Travis I mean, I'm more interested in what was the detail that-

27:57.200 --> 28:01.600
Justin It's got 10 toilets in it and no doors.

28:01.600 --> 28:02.800
That doesn't sound like a house.

28:02.800 --> 28:04.320
I need to get to the bottom of this.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.680
That's like what the kitchen's on the ceiling.

28:07.680 --> 28:09.600
Okay, so you're fucking lying then.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.600
Travis I was hoping this question.

28:11.600 --> 28:14.160
This question went in with and so my question is,

28:14.160 --> 28:16.880
what are some great hobbies that I can maybe get into?

28:16.880 --> 28:18.320
Travis No, but this is the thing.

28:18.320 --> 28:22.320
That's the thing though, I would love to catch somebody in a group.

28:22.320 --> 28:24.880
We all dream of catching somebody in a grift like this.

28:24.880 --> 28:26.800
And so I celebrate your initiative.

28:26.800 --> 28:29.680
Justin There's only one way.

28:29.680 --> 28:31.120
There's only one solution though.

28:31.120 --> 28:33.120
You have to buy the house.

28:33.120 --> 28:37.040
You buy that house, you get some pictures, like move in,

28:37.040 --> 28:40.320
get all your shit in there, then brings a picture to the office

28:40.320 --> 28:44.400
and be like, that's so strange because I live there.

28:46.480 --> 28:46.800
Done.

28:46.800 --> 28:51.680
Travis Or you don't and you'd never tell them,

28:51.680 --> 28:56.480
but you do try to see like how buckwild you can make the story get.

28:56.480 --> 28:56.880
Justin Yes.

28:57.440 --> 29:01.120
Tell me more about the house is the only sentence you need.

29:01.840 --> 29:05.120
Tell me again about the basement, just whatever.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.320
And then you're like, really?

29:06.960 --> 29:08.160
I'm like, that's it.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.960
Travis It's a pretty cool house, but it'd be way cooler

29:10.960 --> 29:13.520
if there were two bowling alleys in it.

29:13.520 --> 29:16.160
And then the next day you show up like, it's funny you said that

29:16.160 --> 29:18.480
because we just finished the remodel and look at that.

29:18.480 --> 29:23.200
And it's a picture of the galaxy bowl down the street.

29:23.200 --> 29:26.560
It's like, oh, great house, wink.

29:26.560 --> 29:28.000
That's you winking to everybody else.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.400
Justin This person is living their own door

29:30.400 --> 29:31.920
slamming farce right now.

29:31.920 --> 29:33.920
And they didn't mean to get in this deep.

29:33.920 --> 29:37.200
I don't know how it happened, but you have a real opportunity here

29:37.840 --> 29:42.160
to get in on the grift.

29:42.160 --> 29:45.440
This is what my first action would be going to this person

29:45.440 --> 29:48.640
in confidence and saying, listen, I know the truth.

29:48.640 --> 29:50.880
And I'm here to tell you, I fucking love it.

29:51.520 --> 29:53.600
Let me get a slice of this.

29:54.320 --> 29:55.360
Let me get up in there.

29:55.360 --> 29:57.840
And then you're like showing up to the office,

29:57.840 --> 30:00.560
like had a great time at the barbecue at your house.

30:00.560 --> 30:02.800
Travis Photoshop pictures of the two of you standing

30:02.800 --> 30:05.440
in front of like Zillow pictures of house.

30:05.440 --> 30:08.080
Justin At least see if you can get some housewarming

30:08.080 --> 30:09.600
swag out of it, something.

30:09.600 --> 30:13.760
Get a pineapple, a potted succulent, something out of it.

30:13.760 --> 30:17.040
And then, oh no, the house burned down.

30:17.040 --> 30:18.240
Fake insurance scam.

30:18.240 --> 30:20.560
Justin You do have to have an out.

30:20.560 --> 30:22.560
You have to have an exit for your grift.

30:22.560 --> 30:24.560
Travis Sold the house, sold the house.

30:24.560 --> 30:25.600
Justin Sold the house again.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.200
Oh, I put it back up for sale.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.840
Travis Flipped it, got the property brothers then.

30:29.840 --> 30:30.720
Property brothers came.

30:30.720 --> 30:31.600
Justin Oh, shoot.

30:31.600 --> 30:35.840
Old man came in, tied balloons, everything floated away

30:35.840 --> 30:37.920
so he could find his wife or whatever.

30:37.920 --> 30:38.720
Didn't see the movie.

30:38.720 --> 30:39.680
I think that's what happens.

30:39.680 --> 30:41.840
Travis And I didn't get full coverage.

30:41.840 --> 30:42.480
So that's on me.

30:42.480 --> 30:43.920
Justin I didn't get full man balloon coverage.

30:43.920 --> 30:44.480
So shoot.

30:45.920 --> 30:46.560
Shoot, I guess.

30:46.560 --> 30:47.840
Travis Sold it.

30:47.840 --> 30:49.600
Damn thing was full of rats.

30:49.600 --> 30:50.000
Had to.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.480
Justin Chocoblock rats.

30:53.040 --> 30:58.080
Or you show up, big bushy fake beard on cool hat

30:58.080 --> 31:01.760
that says like big real construction company.

31:02.400 --> 31:05.200
And then you show up and you're doing a voice like,

31:05.200 --> 31:08.960
hey, I finished fixing all the turlets in the real house

31:08.960 --> 31:09.360
you have.

31:09.360 --> 31:10.720
Travis All 10 of them.

31:10.720 --> 31:12.160
Justin All 10 of them.

31:12.160 --> 31:14.240
Hey, do you know your kitchen's upside down?

31:14.240 --> 31:17.520
Travis I love bowling alleys.

31:17.520 --> 31:19.200
Travis It's the most wonderful,

31:19.200 --> 31:21.360
terrible house I've ever seen in my life.

31:21.360 --> 31:22.640
What a lucky person you are.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.240
Justin I walked into the kitchen,

31:24.240 --> 31:26.400
get a glass of water, fell up to the ceiling,

31:26.400 --> 31:27.760
broke my neck and died.

31:27.760 --> 31:28.400
I'm a goat.

31:28.400 --> 31:29.040
Travis Smash.

31:29.040 --> 31:30.640
Travis Anyways, Mr. Winchester.

31:30.640 --> 31:31.440
Justin Smash.

31:31.440 --> 31:33.440
That's you jumping through the window to escape.

31:33.440 --> 31:34.800
Travis Is it possible?

31:34.800 --> 31:37.440
I watch almost exclusively children's programming.

31:37.440 --> 31:39.040
So this is where my brain goes.

31:39.040 --> 31:42.960
Is it possible your realtor is trying to teach you a lesson

31:42.960 --> 31:44.720
about snooping on people?

31:44.720 --> 31:49.360
Because there is very little that's less wild

31:49.360 --> 31:51.280
than storming into your office and being like,

31:51.280 --> 31:54.080
I know you don't own your house, but they do.

31:54.800 --> 31:57.200
And you've been lied to by your realtor friend.

31:57.200 --> 32:00.880
That is actually the most believable scenario to me.

32:00.880 --> 32:04.240
Travis Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:04.240 --> 32:07.920
This is definitely a backwards, not a honeypot, backwards.

32:07.920 --> 32:09.040
Justin Why would you pick?

32:09.040 --> 32:09.520
Travis Something.

32:09.520 --> 32:11.760
Justin I'm trying to think through the group.

32:11.760 --> 32:16.640
Why would you pick a specific like searchable address?

32:16.640 --> 32:19.200
Because like I know how Zillow works.

32:19.200 --> 32:22.880
And if you told me your address, I could just look.

32:22.880 --> 32:24.800
Like I wouldn't need a realtor friend.

32:24.800 --> 32:27.200
I would just like look at it.

32:27.200 --> 32:28.640
Travis I just bought a house.

32:28.640 --> 32:30.160
You wouldn't know where it is.

32:30.160 --> 32:30.720
Don't worry about it.

32:30.720 --> 32:33.600
Travis Well, I mean, they probably gave a fake address,

32:33.600 --> 32:39.280
but America's so big that there's a house for every address.

32:39.280 --> 32:43.280
So she probably said like 6969 Cool Street.

32:43.280 --> 32:45.920
And it was like, oh, that's that one does.

32:45.920 --> 32:46.880
That one is real.

32:47.440 --> 32:52.080
And by the way, God, I'm looking at some houses right now.

32:52.080 --> 32:55.440
And even if it was like a one bedroom, zero bath,

32:55.440 --> 32:58.320
35 square foot house for $500,000.

32:59.280 --> 33:01.680
If it was on 6969 Cool Street,

33:01.680 --> 33:04.960
like I could bulldoze the house and start over.

33:04.960 --> 33:06.240
You can get a new house.

33:07.440 --> 33:09.920
You can get a remodeled kitchen

33:09.920 --> 33:12.240
and add at least one bathroom to the house.

33:12.240 --> 33:16.160
You cannot just get 6969 Cool Street.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.080
You cannot just buy that address.

33:18.080 --> 33:19.840
Justin Okay, big news.

33:20.800 --> 33:24.160
Oh my fucking God.

33:24.160 --> 33:26.640
Travis Did you just Google 6969 Cool Street?

33:26.640 --> 33:28.720
Justin Yeah, there's one.

33:28.720 --> 33:31.680
And it's in Weed Sport, New York.

33:31.680 --> 33:32.880
There it goes.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.480
I'm not fucking shitting you.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.400
The city is called Weed Sport.

33:36.960 --> 33:42.720
And it's 6969 Cool Street in Weed Sport.

33:42.720 --> 33:44.720
Travis Oh my God, Justin.

33:44.720 --> 33:47.920
Justin That is the choicest.

33:47.920 --> 33:50.080
Travis I mean, I've been looking to, you know,

33:50.080 --> 33:51.680
I missed the seasons.

33:51.680 --> 33:53.280
I got to get out of Texas.

33:53.280 --> 33:55.280
I miss Eastern Time, which is, you know,

33:55.280 --> 33:57.200
not going to be a thing once my thing takes place.

33:57.200 --> 33:58.800
But yeah, it sounds good.

33:58.800 --> 33:59.600
Is it on the market?

33:59.600 --> 34:00.320
Is it available?

34:00.320 --> 34:03.040
Justin It does not look to be available.

34:03.040 --> 34:04.800
Travis Fuck it, I'll show up on their front door

34:04.800 --> 34:06.560
like the fucking finale of the OC

34:06.560 --> 34:07.680
and be like, I know you live here,

34:07.680 --> 34:08.880
but I need to live here.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.640
Did you know your address is the best?

34:10.640 --> 34:11.680
I bet the person that lives there

34:11.680 --> 34:13.680
is the coolest fucking person on Earth.

34:13.680 --> 34:14.400
Justin No question.

34:14.400 --> 34:15.920
Travis Yeah, it's not for sale.

34:15.920 --> 34:16.560
Are you kidding me?

34:16.560 --> 34:17.920
You can't just buy this address.

34:17.920 --> 34:19.440
Justin I hope they're pretty cool,

34:19.440 --> 34:21.520
because we just prompted hundreds of thousands of people

34:21.520 --> 34:23.840
to go like Google Image Search their house.

34:23.840 --> 34:24.640
Travis Oh, please don't, don't, don't, don't,

34:24.640 --> 34:27.200
Justin Don't do this thing, no, no, no, but I am.

34:27.200 --> 34:28.000
But don't, you should don't.

34:28.000 --> 34:28.800
Travis No, but don't, don't, don't, don't.

34:28.800 --> 34:29.440
Justin But I already did.

34:29.440 --> 34:32.320
Travis Admire it from afar without touching.

34:32.320 --> 34:35.200
It's the most beautiful golden fawn

34:35.200 --> 34:36.720
that you've stumbled upon in the forest.

34:36.720 --> 34:38.880
Don't spook it, stay, admire it,

34:38.880 --> 34:41.200
but don't, you know, send them anything.

34:41.200 --> 34:44.560
Justin Man, Weed Sport looks like a cool place too.

34:44.560 --> 34:45.600
It's very small.

34:45.600 --> 34:47.120
Travis It's actually Weed Sport,

34:47.120 --> 34:49.760
and the town's original name was Hacky Sack, New York.

34:49.760 --> 34:51.120
Justin Ha, ha, ha, ha.

34:51.120 --> 34:52.960
Travis But they got it confused with Hackensack,

34:52.960 --> 34:55.120
and so they changed it to Weed Sport.

34:55.120 --> 34:56.160
Justin So they changed it.

34:56.160 --> 34:59.040
Travis That is a fucking good address.

34:59.040 --> 35:00.080
Justin Let's go to the Money Zone,

35:00.080 --> 35:00.960
because usually when we do that,

35:00.960 --> 35:02.000
we take like a little break,

35:02.000 --> 35:05.600
and I can just, you know, talk to Rachel and Henry

35:05.600 --> 35:07.680
and start to figure out this big life move

35:07.680 --> 35:09.440
where we move up to New York.

35:09.440 --> 35:22.320
Travis Our first sponsor this week is Bowl and Branch.

35:22.320 --> 35:23.920
Been a while since we've heard from them.

35:23.920 --> 35:26.560
Justin Don't guilt our sponsor.

35:26.560 --> 35:27.600
Travis No, it's just every two times.

35:27.600 --> 35:29.760
Justin Oh, Bowl and Branch, haven't heard from you in a while.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.680
Travis Still got comfy sheets?

35:31.680 --> 35:33.200
That's right, they do,

35:33.200 --> 35:35.600
and they're going to take your sleep and style

35:35.600 --> 35:38.480
to the next level, and with Bowl and Branch,

35:38.480 --> 35:40.240
that upgrade has never been more affordable.

35:40.880 --> 35:43.280
They're crafted from 100% cotton,

35:44.240 --> 35:46.720
so they look and feel super soft,

35:46.720 --> 35:48.000
because you buy direct from them,

35:48.000 --> 35:49.840
you don't pay expensive retail markups,

35:49.840 --> 35:52.800
and lots of places like the New York Times, Forbes,

35:52.800 --> 35:54.560
and the Wall Street Journal have raved about them.

35:54.560 --> 35:56.400
Travis I'll tell you what, no joke,

35:56.400 --> 35:58.400
when Teresa and I moved into a real house,

35:58.400 --> 36:01.440
which we actually did buy, Justin,

36:03.360 --> 36:07.600
we got a couple new sheet sets from Bowl and Branch

36:07.600 --> 36:10.880
and some new towels for guests and that kind of thing,

36:10.880 --> 36:14.080
and Bowl and Branch was our one-stop shop for,

36:14.080 --> 36:17.440
you know, they have this thing called bath sheets

36:17.440 --> 36:20.320
that are like really huge towels that wrap around you,

36:21.680 --> 36:23.760
they are amazing, highly recommend,

36:23.760 --> 36:26.400
and flannel sheets, flannel sheets perfect

like I didn't know how to cook at all

Griffin, it's your state.

39:54.320 --> 39:55.840

But they're gonna tweet at you, Griffin.

In celeb news this week, the hosts of Lady to Lady

took a break from hanging with today's hottest comedians,

40:16.000 --> 40:19.040
actors, and writers to sell a sex machine.

40:19.680 --> 40:21.360
What'd they do with all that cash?

40:41.920 --> 40:42.560
Yes.

40:42.560 --> 40:44.560
This one was sent in by Dylan Haston.

40:46.320 --> 40:47.040
Thank you, Dylan.

40:47.040 --> 40:49.280
It's anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.160
I'm gonna call them.

40:51.120 --> 40:58.400
Ann asks, what is the saddest story you can think of

40:58.400 --> 41:00.560
using only four words?

41:00.560 --> 41:06.560
Oh, for sale, baby, oops.

41:09.600 --> 41:12.720
For sale, for sale, baby, oops.

41:14.080 --> 41:17.120
Unused baby shoes.

41:18.720 --> 41:20.640
Cheap, cheap, cheap.

41:21.920 --> 41:24.560
Unused baby, hey, I just shortened that.

41:24.560 --> 41:27.840
We just shortened that dumb six word story into a four word story.

41:28.480 --> 41:29.760
Unused baby shoes.

41:29.760 --> 41:32.800
Cheap, cheap, cheap.

41:32.800 --> 41:33.680
That's four words.

41:33.680 --> 41:36.960
We could probably get it down shorter.

41:36.960 --> 41:38.080
I can do it in one word.

41:38.640 --> 41:39.140
Okay.

41:39.680 --> 41:40.400
Tears.

41:40.400 --> 41:43.520
That's actually not that good.

41:43.520 --> 41:45.600
Okay, wait, I can do it in one.

41:45.600 --> 41:46.100
Sad.

41:46.720 --> 41:48.560
Yeah, it's still not great.

41:48.560 --> 41:50.880
Wait, maybe if I make that one word really long though.

41:50.880 --> 41:51.380
Sad.

41:53.520 --> 41:55.120
No, it's nothing.

41:57.280 --> 41:59.520
Four word sad story.

41:59.520 --> 42:01.040
Diarrhea at the prom.

42:01.040 --> 42:02.320
And that one can be real.

42:03.760 --> 42:06.960
I actually don't wanna say anything else.

42:06.960 --> 42:09.200
All I want are those fucking answers.

42:09.200 --> 42:10.640
Oh, it's funny that you say that, Justin,

42:10.640 --> 42:12.080
because you got some good ones.

42:12.080 --> 42:13.200
Yeah, I bet we do.

42:13.760 --> 42:16.240
Faith said, my taco has fallen.

42:18.080 --> 42:21.760
How about this one from Eve who says, the sale is over.

42:21.760 --> 42:23.920
Hashtag only girls know.

42:23.920 --> 42:25.280
Oh, jeez.

42:25.280 --> 42:30.240
Okay, you can't have a sad four word story

42:30.240 --> 42:33.440
and then hashtag it to make it land.

42:33.440 --> 42:34.320
That's nothing.

42:35.600 --> 42:38.560
Rekara said, I stepped on Lego.

42:38.560 --> 42:40.080
So that's very relatable.

42:40.880 --> 42:41.440
There's five pages of these.

42:41.440 --> 42:42.480
But no, wait, no, no, no, hold on.

42:42.480 --> 42:42.800
Hold on.

42:42.800 --> 42:43.520
No, no, no, no, no.

42:44.720 --> 42:46.560
It's not like deer and deer.

42:46.560 --> 42:48.320
I stepped on Lego.

42:48.320 --> 42:51.120
Do you mean you stepped on a Lego or some Lego?

42:51.120 --> 42:52.400
It's a five word story.

42:52.400 --> 42:56.320
Just drop the article just to get breezy with it.

42:58.320 --> 42:59.760
Lego stepping.

42:59.760 --> 43:01.840
Yeah, that dog don't hunt.

43:01.840 --> 43:02.400
Sorry.

43:02.400 --> 43:04.160
Oh, actually, there's a good one.

43:04.160 --> 43:05.120
That dog don't hunt.

43:05.120 --> 43:06.080
That dog don't hunt.

43:07.520 --> 43:10.560
Socrates says, the Clintons are crooks.

43:10.560 --> 43:11.760
So wait a minute.

43:12.800 --> 43:14.000
This was a day ago.

43:14.000 --> 43:14.720
This is still.

43:16.160 --> 43:17.280
And not that sad.

43:17.840 --> 43:20.160
I mean, it's sad for you, I guess.

43:20.160 --> 43:22.960
Do people not know what sad means?

43:22.960 --> 43:23.680
I stepped on Lego.

43:23.680 --> 43:24.240
That's not sad.

43:24.240 --> 43:25.200
It's painful.

43:25.200 --> 43:30.320
Do you step on a Lego and feel like just sadness for the Lego maybe or for you?

43:30.320 --> 43:31.600
A lot of political tweets.

43:31.600 --> 43:33.760
And there's six pages of answers.

43:33.760 --> 43:37.920
It's just, are any of them actually sad?

43:37.920 --> 43:43.040
Oh, I mean, this one from Bramjeet says, love kills people.

43:43.040 --> 43:44.800
Bramjeet was like, I need three.

43:44.800 --> 43:46.160
And also it still makes sense.

43:46.160 --> 43:47.280
I got it in three.

43:47.280 --> 43:48.960
Hatchet man tattoo fading.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.240
See, that's sad.

43:50.240 --> 43:51.440
That's quite sad.

43:51.440 --> 43:57.600
The real reason I wanted to do this was because of a really great and poignant poem that was

43:57.600 --> 43:59.520
dropped in here by an anonymous user.

43:59.520 --> 44:03.760
But it's a shame they were anonymous because they could be a new poet laureate.

44:03.760 --> 44:07.680
And I'll try to separate the words out so you can sort of tell where the four are.

44:08.320 --> 44:13.760
My grandpa died too early.

44:13.760 --> 44:19.600
Too early.

44:19.600 --> 44:24.720
And that's number two early sort of in one sort of word experience.

44:25.280 --> 44:27.120
My grandpa died too furious.

44:27.120 --> 44:46.800
You know, I would point out here that too early is redundant because you could just

44:46.800 --> 44:51.760
say he died early because too early, I mean, it's implied by the early.

44:51.760 --> 44:55.680
What about like my or not my, we have to lose my.

44:55.680 --> 44:57.360
Grandpa died on time.

44:59.120 --> 45:00.640
Grandpa died too late.

45:01.920 --> 45:05.760
Well, if you're going to drop the my, I mean, grandpa died too early.

45:05.760 --> 45:06.800
You don't need the my.

45:06.800 --> 45:07.520
That's obvious.

45:07.520 --> 45:08.240
Who's grandpa?

45:08.240 --> 45:08.880
Who do you think?

45:10.960 --> 45:12.560
Why not just grandpa died?

45:12.560 --> 45:18.000
Is there a time where your grandpa died where you're like, yeah, that went down smooth.

45:18.000 --> 45:18.880
Awesome.

45:18.880 --> 45:19.520
Oh, cool.

45:19.520 --> 45:21.200
I had a test tomorrow.

45:21.200 --> 45:22.080
Thank you, grandpa.

45:22.080 --> 45:25.680
One last present from the old man.

45:25.680 --> 45:29.040
I mean, people make a big deal out of that baby shoes one, huh?

45:29.040 --> 45:32.800
But like, it seems wicked easy to do this with even fewer words.

45:32.800 --> 45:36.800
I don't think that that's as big of a deal as we sort of make it out to be.

45:39.520 --> 45:42.240
Oh, no, that's two.

45:43.760 --> 45:46.240
Oh, no, family explode.

45:48.400 --> 45:49.440
Come on, dude.

45:50.080 --> 45:51.440
That was Hemingway, right?

45:51.440 --> 45:52.080
Did that one?

45:52.880 --> 45:54.160
Oh, no.

45:55.840 --> 45:57.840
Oh, shoot.

45:59.440 --> 46:01.680
Wife disappeared.

46:03.520 --> 46:04.640
Oh, no.

46:04.640 --> 46:05.680
Puppy melted.

46:07.120 --> 46:09.760
Oh, beans, wolf attack.

46:12.320 --> 46:13.360
Oh, no.

46:13.360 --> 46:14.800
Family frozen.

46:14.800 --> 46:15.760
Family froze.

46:16.880 --> 46:17.280
Shoot.

46:18.800 --> 46:20.080
Farted on crush.

46:20.080 --> 46:21.520
Crush Mondays.

46:22.800 --> 46:25.120
That one's fun because it's got sort of two.

46:25.120 --> 46:25.920
It's too sad.

46:25.920 --> 46:32.400
It brings you down and then at the end, it's sort of like a funny Garfield thing.

46:32.400 --> 46:33.440
How about another question?

46:33.440 --> 46:35.760
Stone cold Steve Austin.

46:37.920 --> 46:42.000
And then a sad face emoticon because that doesn't count as a word.

46:42.880 --> 46:44.400
Yeah, I guess that's fine.

46:44.400 --> 46:47.120
I work at an Ethiopian restaurant in Michigan.

46:47.120 --> 46:52.160
Every Thursday, an 80-year-old man dressed in hiking gear comes to eat just before close.

46:52.160 --> 46:55.440
When I prompt him for his order, it's always the same response.

46:55.440 --> 46:57.600
He says, give me the bean combo.

46:58.240 --> 46:59.600
There is no bean combo.

46:59.600 --> 47:00.560
Oh, man.

47:00.560 --> 47:04.240
I ask him to clarify and he just grumpily changes his order.

47:05.280 --> 47:09.280
What is the bean combo and why won't he tell me what it is himself?

47:10.080 --> 47:13.280
And that's from there is no Ethiopian secret menu.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.480
Justin, it seems like if any of us are going to know what the bean combo is,

47:16.480 --> 47:17.520
it's going to be you.

47:18.560 --> 47:19.600
Here's what you do.

47:19.600 --> 47:20.640
Get some beans.

47:20.640 --> 47:22.320
You cook them up real nice.

47:22.320 --> 47:24.160
And then what's that on the side of them?

47:24.160 --> 47:25.200
You guessed it.

47:25.200 --> 47:26.320
Different beans.

47:26.320 --> 47:26.800
Okay.

47:27.360 --> 47:28.400
So you just kind of...

47:28.400 --> 47:29.680
What kind of cocktail do you like?

47:29.680 --> 47:31.120
Like a garbanzo pinto?

47:31.120 --> 47:31.760
Me?

47:31.760 --> 47:33.280
Thank you for asking, Griffin.

47:33.280 --> 47:37.920
Black beans are the best beans, but then you'd all mix in there.

47:37.920 --> 47:39.040
Great northern.

47:39.040 --> 47:42.240
It's like that great old tune, Ebony and Ivory.

47:42.240 --> 47:43.520
I'm promoting harmony.

47:43.520 --> 47:45.680
That's yeah, it's explicitly what the song is about.

47:45.680 --> 47:46.080
Sure.

47:46.080 --> 47:46.580
Yeah.

47:48.480 --> 47:50.960
This old man comes in here every Thursday.

47:50.960 --> 47:55.840
How have you not just been worn down and added a bean combo to the menu?

47:55.840 --> 47:56.480
Yeah, yeah.

47:56.480 --> 47:57.040
You know what?

47:57.600 --> 47:58.480
You got it.

47:58.480 --> 47:59.040
You got it.

47:59.040 --> 48:00.480
Bean combo coming right up.

48:00.480 --> 48:04.320
You can name it after him, by which I mean you can call it shithead.

48:05.600 --> 48:08.080
You can't go into a restaurant, order something that's not there,

48:08.080 --> 48:09.440
unless it is actually kind of the...

48:10.160 --> 48:11.600
It's a pretty sick move actually.

48:11.600 --> 48:15.280
And we may have actually just found out who lives at 6969 Cool Street.

48:15.280 --> 48:16.960
Is it possible?

48:16.960 --> 48:18.400
He's wearing the same outfit.

48:18.400 --> 48:19.840
He's ordering the same thing.

48:20.880 --> 48:24.080
Is it possible that this older gentleman...

48:24.880 --> 48:25.680
Definitely.

48:25.680 --> 48:26.160
Definitely.

48:26.160 --> 48:27.600
I know where you're going, and I definitely...

48:28.800 --> 48:30.080
Do you know where I'm going?

48:30.080 --> 48:30.320
Yeah.

48:30.320 --> 48:33.680
Because where I'm going is he's doing a Groundhog Day.

48:33.680 --> 48:34.960
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

48:34.960 --> 48:35.920
He's doing it.

48:36.560 --> 48:39.040
He just thinks he's doing a Groundhog Day.

48:39.040 --> 48:43.200
You know, like he thinks he's in Groundhog Day, and to your credit,

48:43.200 --> 48:45.600
it sounds like you're reacting the same every time too.

48:46.160 --> 48:48.560
So you're not really doing anything to break him out of this Groundhog Day.

48:48.560 --> 48:50.160
Yeah, here's that bean combo, man.

48:51.200 --> 48:52.080
I've done it.

48:52.080 --> 48:52.720
I did it.

48:52.720 --> 48:54.240
I'm in the right timeline.

48:54.240 --> 48:55.760
Thank you, Andy McTowell.

48:55.760 --> 48:58.720
I was gonna say, it's 1965.

48:59.840 --> 49:06.320
And Chester, this dude's name, goes to his favorite diner, Ralph's Bean Hole,

49:06.320 --> 49:10.960
and he goes there and he cramps his favorite meal, the big bean combo.

49:10.960 --> 49:13.280
And he's wearing his hiking gear because he's about to, you know,

49:13.280 --> 49:15.120
go out on the big one, the big journey.

49:15.680 --> 49:20.000
But Ralph is like, oh, don't go into that ravine.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.040
You know, it's dangerous.

49:21.040 --> 49:23.200
Lots of coyotes and crevasses.

49:23.200 --> 49:26.400
And Chester's like, no, I got this one.

49:26.400 --> 49:32.320
And he falls into the crevasse, and he lands in four wolf's mouths,

49:32.320 --> 49:34.560
and they just make short work of him.

49:34.560 --> 49:39.360
And now, every Thursday, because that was the day, the fateful day,

49:39.360 --> 49:44.720
his unrestful spirit wanders into this place.

49:44.720 --> 49:48.000
Now it's an Ethiopian restaurant because Ralph made a lot of bad decisions.

49:50.240 --> 49:54.480
He should have offered something besides beans, in retrospect.

49:54.480 --> 49:56.800
And so now he comes in and he's like,

49:56.800 --> 50:01.520
let me get the bean combo so that I may finally be free.

50:01.520 --> 50:02.720
Because that's what's going to happen.

50:02.720 --> 50:07.360
One day you will cook them some beans, and he's just going to disappear

50:07.360 --> 50:10.000
because you've sort of, you know, Sixth Sense,

50:10.560 --> 50:12.560
sort of finished his business on this world.

50:13.360 --> 50:16.720
Here's the, if it's any kind of like a regular time,

50:16.720 --> 50:20.640
if it's like 7 p.m. every Thursday, what if you just like,

50:20.640 --> 50:24.160
okay, what if you just like had a table ready for him?

50:25.040 --> 50:28.400
Like with like special care put to it,

50:28.400 --> 50:30.720
and like a little like plaque with his name,

50:30.720 --> 50:33.680
like a little, you know, note card, place card with his name.

50:33.680 --> 50:36.400
Oh my god, this is going to get you on the,

50:36.400 --> 50:38.240
this is going to get you on the local news, by the way.

50:38.880 --> 50:42.000
This Ethiopian restaurant has gone out of its way

50:42.000 --> 50:44.640
to help out this very confused old ghost.

50:45.280 --> 50:46.880
Please do it for the vine.

50:47.520 --> 50:49.520
Just do it for the vine.

50:49.520 --> 50:53.600
Do it for the vine of the old man reacting to this great miracle that you've done.

50:53.600 --> 50:55.200
And then you lift the lid and it's beans,

50:55.200 --> 50:56.320
and people watching at home are like,

50:56.320 --> 50:58.480
oh, this is a mean prank, it's just beans.

50:58.480 --> 51:01.200
But his face at the beans!

51:01.200 --> 51:06.400
His face as he looks up and smiles with a tear in his eye as he turns into vapor,

51:06.400 --> 51:08.000
and finally goes to heaven.

51:09.280 --> 51:11.440
Please release this man with beans.

51:11.440 --> 51:13.920
Please set him free with beans.

51:13.920 --> 51:17.120
You have beans in the back, just make the old ghost some beans.

51:17.120 --> 51:21.360
For just pennies a day, you can set this ghost free with beans.

51:21.360 --> 51:23.440
How good is your Ethiopian restaurant doing

51:23.440 --> 51:25.280
that you're not listening to your customers?

51:25.280 --> 51:29.680
Because to me, it sounds like your customers are crazy for the bean combo,

51:29.680 --> 51:31.760
and you should probably get it on the menu.

51:31.760 --> 51:33.920
Also, how good is your Ethiopian restaurant

51:33.920 --> 51:36.960
that this dude consistently doesn't get what he wants,

51:36.960 --> 51:39.120
but is like, I can't say no to it.

51:39.120 --> 51:40.480
They never have what I want,

51:40.480 --> 51:44.160
but damn, if it isn't the finest Ethiopian food I've ever had.

51:44.160 --> 51:44.720
Guess what?

51:44.720 --> 51:46.080
Kusra's always right.

51:46.080 --> 51:47.840
So you do have bean combo.

51:47.840 --> 51:50.800
Please, to make.

51:50.800 --> 51:53.680
When I'm going to IHOP and I say, let me get an enchilada,

51:56.000 --> 51:57.440
I am correct.

51:57.440 --> 52:02.240
Yeah, they're going to wrap a thin pancake around some strawberries

52:02.240 --> 52:05.200
and they're going to give you a crepe.

52:06.320 --> 52:07.600
Sounds good as hell, though, still.

52:07.600 --> 52:08.400
I think I would curse that.

52:08.400 --> 52:10.080
Yeah, now I kind of want that.

52:10.080 --> 52:11.200
I do kind of want that.

52:12.000 --> 52:15.040
Just banish this old ghost and get on the news.

52:15.040 --> 52:16.640
Just kill this ghost.

52:16.640 --> 52:21.200
This Ethiopian restaurant went out of its way to do one final act of kindness

52:21.200 --> 52:23.280
and banish this ghost to the hell dimension.

52:24.880 --> 52:25.920
This real ghost.

52:25.920 --> 52:27.840
I'd like you to meet Derek.

52:27.840 --> 52:29.680
He went to the store to get beans.

52:29.680 --> 52:30.800
There's no more news.

52:32.640 --> 52:34.240
It's been a slow week.

52:34.240 --> 52:35.680
It's been a slow week.

52:35.680 --> 52:39.200
We here at WeedSport, it's been real chill.

52:39.760 --> 52:44.000
I don't think ghosts are real qualifies as a slow news day.

52:45.040 --> 52:46.240
Well, ghosts were real.

52:48.480 --> 52:51.840
The one we had, we let get away with being.

52:51.840 --> 52:56.240
Earth's last ghost extinguished by an unthoughtful bean dealer.

52:56.880 --> 52:58.880
Hello and welcome to news.

52:58.880 --> 53:03.280
We've gotten so many complaints about how big and scary everything is all the time.

53:03.280 --> 53:06.160
So we thought we'd give you something a little bit more lightweight.

53:06.880 --> 53:10.960
We'd like you to meet Jeremy who went to the store to get beans to kill an old ghost.

53:10.960 --> 53:18.000
Here with this package is journalist Amanda Goodcamera.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.560
Hi, I'm Amanda Goodcamera.

53:20.560 --> 53:21.360
It's true.

53:21.360 --> 53:24.560
The beans have been displayed and the ghost is no more.

53:25.360 --> 53:29.360
The terror that once plagued this Ethiopian restaurant is gone.

53:29.360 --> 53:30.320
Thank you, beans.

53:30.320 --> 53:31.280
You've done it again.

53:32.000 --> 53:36.720
We didn't film the ghost, unfortunately, because fucking Jeremy was a little hot on the trigger,

53:36.720 --> 53:37.280
but...

53:37.280 --> 53:41.840
He just, he told us he went to the store and bought the beans and we just thought like,

53:41.840 --> 53:43.360
yeah, fuck it.

53:44.080 --> 53:45.040
This has been news.

53:45.840 --> 53:46.800
Sorry for cussing.

53:48.320 --> 53:49.680
We've been canceled.

53:49.680 --> 53:50.560
We've been canceled.

53:50.560 --> 53:51.520
News is canceled.

53:55.040 --> 53:57.520
That is going to do it for us this week, folks.

53:57.520 --> 54:01.120
I hope you've enjoyed yourself here on our program.

54:01.920 --> 54:03.520
We've certainly enjoyed having you.

54:03.520 --> 54:07.520
Our program, we've certainly enjoyed having you.

54:07.520 --> 54:08.240
I'll say that.

54:09.280 --> 54:14.160
Hey, if you live in Chicago or Milwaukee, I think Milwaukee is close to sold out,

54:15.600 --> 54:18.400
which is exciting, but we're going to be up there here in a couple of weeks.

54:19.760 --> 54:23.280
So if you live there, Chicago, we're going to be there November 16th at the Chicago Theater.

54:23.280 --> 54:25.600
Milwaukee, we're going to be at the Riverside Theater on November 19th.

54:25.600 --> 54:31.920
You can find tickets at macroshows.com slash tours and come see us if you live there because

54:31.920 --> 54:34.080
there's still some tickets available and we'd love to see you.

54:35.520 --> 54:41.280
If you would like to see us, you could also go to podcon.com, register for PodCon.

54:41.280 --> 54:43.200
It is going to be a very cool convention.

54:43.200 --> 54:48.560
We've been sort of involved with all like the planning stuff and setting up the whole

54:48.560 --> 54:51.440
thing with the Knightville folks and Hank Green.

54:51.440 --> 54:54.640
And I think it's going to be a really cool event.

54:54.640 --> 54:57.760
If you go to podcon.com, you can just get tickets.

54:57.760 --> 55:00.720
Now, even if you're not going to be in the area, they have remote attendance.

55:00.720 --> 55:06.400
So it's like you are there and you'll get audio recordings of almost all the panels,

55:06.400 --> 55:09.120
performances and live recordings from PodCon.

55:09.680 --> 55:12.000
And this sounds really neat.

55:13.280 --> 55:14.480
Two more plugs, I promise.

55:14.480 --> 55:20.240
Real quick, Teresa and I, along with our dad, Clint, who does the Adventure Zone with us,

55:20.240 --> 55:22.880

55:22.880 --> 55:26.720

It's amazing and come hang out with everybody on a fun boat for a week.

55:32.720 --> 55:35.680
And also, what was the other thing I was going to say?

55:35.680 --> 55:40.960
Oh yeah, our Adventure Zone podcast, the D&D podcast where we play with our dad.

55:40.960 --> 55:46.720
One, we started a new arc that our dad is DMing where we play as superheroes and it is super fun.

55:46.720 --> 55:47.600
It's so much fun.

55:48.160 --> 55:50.720
Dad is doing a great job and we're really pleased with how it's going.

55:50.720 --> 55:56.240
In the second episode, we go to a rundown Bible themed theme park.

55:56.240 --> 55:59.920
It's so, so great and we're having so much fun and I bet you will too.

56:00.800 --> 56:04.560
And with the Adventure Zone, we have a graphic novel coming out

56:04.560 --> 56:10.640
and you can go to theadventurezonecomic.com and pre-order that now.

56:10.640 --> 56:15.920

56:21.760 --> 56:24.320
Thanks to Sean Roderick and The Long Winters for the use of our theme song,

56:24.320 --> 56:26.480
It's a Departure off the album Painting the Days to Bed.

56:26.480 --> 56:29.760
It's a super, super good album that maybe it's getting a little bit colder.

56:31.040 --> 56:34.560
Maybe you're settling in for your own long winter and you want a good soundtrack for it.

56:34.560 --> 56:35.360
It is this.

56:35.360 --> 56:36.960

Yeah, here comes that final yahoo.

You'll probably get there.
